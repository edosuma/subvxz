WEBVTT

00:06.876 --> 00:08.530
Boys, boys.

00:08.573 --> 00:11.881
You notice anything
different about me?

00:11.924 --> 00:12.925
Uh, no, but I noticed

00:12.969 --> 00:14.101
something different
about your mom

00:14.144 --> 00:15.667
when I left her house
this morning.

00:15.711 --> 00:18.322
Oh!
- Boom! You just got Ari'd.

00:18.366 --> 00:19.932
Nice, Ari.

00:19.976 --> 00:21.064
No. New suit.

00:21.108 --> 00:22.761
David set me up
with his tailor.

00:22.805 --> 00:24.067
My guy's a magician.

00:24.111 --> 00:25.503
He'd have to be
to make Trevor look hot.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.505
- You just said Trevor looked hot.
- You love Trevor.

00:27.549 --> 00:29.029
Damn it.

00:29.072 --> 00:30.595
Pinkus, hand me
my briefcase.

00:30.639 --> 00:32.119
And open it for me.

00:32.162 --> 00:33.990
I'm sorry, what-- am I
the summer associate?

00:34.034 --> 00:35.035
He's not. Right, right.

00:35.078 --> 00:37.428
Pinkus. So dumb.

00:37.472 --> 00:39.343
Ugh. Chekhov Chill?

00:39.387 --> 00:41.041
- Oh!
- You just got chilled.

00:41.084 --> 00:42.564
You guys.

00:42.607 --> 00:43.913
Chug, chug, chug, chug,

00:46.176 --> 00:47.873
chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug,

00:47.917 --> 00:49.962
chug, chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug...

00:51.790 --> 00:53.662
All right, all right,
I have an announcement.

00:53.705 --> 00:55.403
That's actually a
celebratory cocktail,

00:55.446 --> 00:58.058
'cause starting this Monday,
you are no longer lowly scum.

00:58.101 --> 01:00.060
You are a full
member of the team.

01:00.103 --> 01:01.583
No. No way.
I'm getting promoted?

01:01.626 --> 01:04.064
Mazel, Pinkus, and we're
taking you out tonight.

01:04.107 --> 01:06.022
- Yes!
- Yeah, my folks are in Europe,

01:06.066 --> 01:07.415
so we're hitting
the country estate.

01:07.458 --> 01:09.199
Pinkus, Pinkus,

01:09.243 --> 01:11.723
Pinkus, Pinkus, Pinkus, Pinkus,

01:11.767 --> 01:13.856
<i>Pinkus, Pinkus...</i>

01:13.899 --> 01:16.119
<i>This is gonna be</i> <i>
the best night ever!</i>

01:16.163 --> 01:17.555
<i>Yeah!</i>

01:23.518 --> 01:25.172
No, that's great.

01:25.215 --> 01:27.130
Uh-huh. We'll be here.

01:27.174 --> 01:28.523
That was the jeweler.

01:28.566 --> 01:30.177
He thinks he might have
found someone, babe.

01:30.220 --> 01:32.004
- No way. That's amazing.
- What's going on?

01:32.048 --> 01:34.224
Oh, remember the vintage watch
we took off the corpse

01:34.268 --> 01:36.183
of Hetty's dead
robber baron husband?

01:36.226 --> 01:38.141
How exciting do you think
our afterlives are

01:38.185 --> 01:39.838
that we wouldn't remember that?

01:39.882 --> 01:41.362
Well, we may
finally have a buyer.

01:41.405 --> 01:42.754
How much does he think
we can get?

01:42.798 --> 01:45.017
Enough to knock out
our entire debt, babe.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.541
And the guy's coming
up from the city

01:46.584 --> 01:48.412
this afternoon to look at it.

01:48.456 --> 01:51.372
Ooh, man, we really need
this sale to go through.

01:51.415 --> 01:55.245
What is that smell?
Oh, yeah, desperation.

01:55.289 --> 01:57.595
Listen to me, the most important
bargaining chip you have

01:57.639 --> 01:59.641
is the ability to walk away.

01:59.684 --> 02:02.861
I would argue a lead pipe beats
that, but I get your point.

02:02.905 --> 02:05.299
The ghosts are saying we
shouldn't act too desperate.

02:05.342 --> 02:06.778
Oh, guys, come on.
Have some faith.

02:06.822 --> 02:08.519
I'm a master negotiator.

02:08.563 --> 02:10.695
Do you remember the deal
I got us on the Mini?

02:10.739 --> 02:13.220
I don't know that that was
the victory you think it...

02:13.263 --> 02:17.006
Babe, has our
undercarriage rusted? Has it?

02:17.049 --> 02:18.268
No, I think not.

02:18.312 --> 02:21.141
And they threw that in for free.

02:22.968 --> 02:24.405
Man,

02:24.448 --> 02:26.146
picking something to watch
is much more difficult

02:26.189 --> 02:27.277
than it was in the '80s.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.496
Too many choices.

02:28.539 --> 02:30.672
Pete, just make up your mind.

02:30.715 --> 02:32.587
Maybe go back through
the romantic comedies,

02:32.630 --> 02:34.502
- comb through those again?
- No!

02:34.545 --> 02:36.852
Thor not watch
romantic comedies.

02:36.895 --> 02:39.028
Thor hate love.

02:39.071 --> 02:40.812
You okay, there, big guy?

02:40.856 --> 02:43.641
Thor had a pretty emotional
therapy session the other day.

02:43.685 --> 02:48.298
A lot come up. Thor discuss
feelings about Flower.

02:48.342 --> 02:51.301
Oh. And what did
the therapist say?

02:51.345 --> 02:53.303
She thinks I should tell Flower

02:53.347 --> 02:55.479
how I truly feel.

02:55.523 --> 02:58.221
And I agree with her.
This is the new you, buddy.

02:58.265 --> 02:59.831
You talk about things.

02:59.875 --> 03:01.442
Thor scared.

03:01.485 --> 03:04.662
Can it ever really work out
between a hippie and a Viking?

03:04.706 --> 03:07.361
Oh, now, that's a romantic
comedy I would watch.

03:07.404 --> 03:09.189
Can you type in
"hippie and Viking,"

03:09.232 --> 03:10.320
see if anything comes up?

03:10.364 --> 03:11.887
Oh, yeah, sure.

03:18.067 --> 03:20.243
Welcome. Hi. I'm Sam,

03:20.287 --> 03:21.592
and this is Jay.

03:21.636 --> 03:23.246
Hey, what's up, man? I'm Ari.

03:23.290 --> 03:24.813
Hey, what's going on?

03:24.856 --> 03:26.771
All right, well, we're really
excited to have you here.

03:26.815 --> 03:28.904
Not too excited. Just the
appropriate amount of excited.

03:28.947 --> 03:31.211
This is gonna be a disaster.

03:31.254 --> 03:35.171
Hey, you know what is nuts?
I've actually been here before.

03:35.215 --> 03:36.259
Oh, yeah.

03:36.303 --> 03:38.305
He does seem familiar.

03:39.567 --> 03:42.222
Holy crap. Is that Ari Cantor?

03:42.265 --> 03:45.225
Oh!
- Boom! You just got Ari'd.

03:45.268 --> 03:47.270
Wait, you know him?

03:47.314 --> 03:48.837
Yeah, he's, like, my boy.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.491
- Know who?
- I-I was just

03:50.534 --> 03:52.232
asking Jay if he knew you.

03:52.275 --> 03:53.885
I mean, we just met.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.060
Right, so now you know him.

03:55.104 --> 03:56.148
Yep.

03:56.192 --> 03:57.976
Anyway, yeah, I knew this guy

03:58.020 --> 04:00.283
whose parents owned this place,
David Woodstone.

04:00.327 --> 04:02.285
My great-great-great-grandson,

04:02.329 --> 04:04.331
who was actually
kind of a louse.

04:04.374 --> 04:06.681
Uh, David was my uncle.
I didn't really know him,

04:06.724 --> 04:08.770
but his mom was
my great-aunt Sophie,

04:08.813 --> 04:10.511
who I inherited
this place from.

04:10.554 --> 04:12.730
He was obsessed
with strippers.

04:12.774 --> 04:14.863
I heard he was
a good guy, though.

04:14.906 --> 04:17.474
Man, this place
is really bringing back

04:17.518 --> 04:18.910
some memories for me.

04:18.954 --> 04:21.783
Wow, well,
I could show you around,

04:21.826 --> 04:23.872
or do you want to see
the watch first?

04:23.915 --> 04:24.960
Nah, not yet.

04:25.003 --> 04:26.831
Cool, uh, yeah. Let's chitchat.

04:26.875 --> 04:28.311
That's how not big of a deal

04:28.355 --> 04:30.313
this whole watch transaction
is to me.

04:30.357 --> 04:31.662
Uh, right this way.

04:31.706 --> 04:33.490
I can't believe this.

04:33.534 --> 04:35.100
Trevor, you know this guy?

04:35.144 --> 04:36.406
Ari and I worked together.

04:36.450 --> 04:39.104
He was in my crew.
We were, like, best friends.

04:39.148 --> 04:40.323
No way. That's crazy.

04:40.367 --> 04:42.282
You want to know something
really crazy?

04:42.325 --> 04:44.022
He was here the night
that I died.

04:44.066 --> 04:47.025
Okay, how did you die, and why
aren't you wearing any pants?

04:47.069 --> 04:48.984
You've never asked him
about this?

04:49.027 --> 04:50.942
I was always curious,
but I didn't know the etiquette

04:50.986 --> 04:52.074
around ghost deaths.

04:52.117 --> 04:54.337
Tell her the story, Trev.

04:54.381 --> 04:56.252
All right.

04:56.296 --> 04:57.514
I thought you'd never ask.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.693
It was the year 2000.

05:02.737 --> 05:05.870
- Y2
- K was behind us, mad cow was Europe's problem,

05:05.914 --> 05:07.611
and the future was bright.

05:07.655 --> 05:08.873
- Oh, yeah.
- All right!

05:08.917 --> 05:10.222
Ari, can you hand me
that pillow, please?

05:10.266 --> 05:12.573
Why? Is there a Chekhov Chill
behind it?

05:12.616 --> 05:13.835
Oh...

05:13.878 --> 05:15.489
'Cause if there is,
you know the rules.

05:15.532 --> 05:18.318
The attempted chiller
is himself chilled.

05:19.623 --> 05:20.581
Damn it!

05:20.624 --> 05:22.496
No one chills the A-dog.

05:22.539 --> 05:23.671
Drink up, Lefkowitz.

05:23.714 --> 05:25.237
Oh, your day will come.

05:25.281 --> 05:26.891
Keep dreaming.

05:26.935 --> 05:28.110
Here we go.

05:28.153 --> 05:29.459
Chug, chug, chug,

05:29.503 --> 05:30.982
chug, chug, chug,

05:32.854 --> 05:34.377
chug, chug, chug,

05:34.421 --> 05:35.944
chug, chug...

05:35.987 --> 05:38.076
- T-Money. Come on.
- That was awesome.

05:38.120 --> 05:40.122
You better get
your buzz on, too, Pinkus.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.297
Help you stay warm

05:41.341 --> 05:43.299
- during the Run of Fun.
- The Run of Fun?

05:43.343 --> 05:45.780
It's just so humiliating.

05:45.823 --> 05:47.042
Uh, what's the Run of Fun?

05:47.085 --> 05:48.739
How about,
instead of any hazing,

05:48.783 --> 05:52.352
we just party and celebrate
Pinkus's promotion?

05:52.395 --> 05:53.875
Dude, hazing
is to prove loyalty.

05:53.918 --> 05:55.180
We all went through it.

05:55.224 --> 05:57.400
To question it
is to break the bro code.

05:58.880 --> 06:01.361
Are you breaking
the bro code, bro?

06:05.800 --> 06:07.497
Psych.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.238
Got you.

06:09.281 --> 06:11.414
You're running, Pinkus.
All right, ladies.

06:11.458 --> 06:13.242
Time to take
this night up a notch.

06:13.285 --> 06:15.113
How I love Woodstone's
secret drug drawer.

06:15.157 --> 06:16.550
It's so baller.

06:17.681 --> 06:19.422
Name of the game

06:19.466 --> 06:20.858
is pill roulette.

06:20.902 --> 06:22.904
Take one, find out
what happens.

06:22.947 --> 06:24.819
I'm first.

06:26.342 --> 06:28.649
I wish there was a green one
for T-Money.

06:28.692 --> 06:33.044
But yellow and blue make green.

06:35.351 --> 06:36.308
What?!

06:36.352 --> 06:37.745
Damn!

06:37.788 --> 06:40.138
Two pills!

06:40.182 --> 06:42.750
And I was a total legend.

06:42.793 --> 06:45.317
For two hours
until your heart exploded.

06:45.361 --> 06:46.971
Tell her how you
lost your pants.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.625
This is classic Trev.

06:48.669 --> 06:50.627
Well, post-drug cocktail,
pre-death,

06:50.671 --> 06:52.499
I had sex
with the hot limo driver.

06:52.542 --> 06:54.414
All right,
so you died having sex?

06:54.457 --> 06:56.546
No, I died about
15 minutes later.

06:56.590 --> 06:58.592
Then why were your pants not on?

06:58.635 --> 07:00.463
Because we were
gonna do it again.

07:00.507 --> 07:01.812
Does a boxer put
his robe back on

07:01.856 --> 07:04.249
between rounds one and two?
Come on, Sam.

07:06.904 --> 07:08.602
So,

07:08.645 --> 07:11.039
you probably won't
remember this, but, uh,

07:11.082 --> 07:12.257
several months ago,

07:12.301 --> 07:13.955
during Viking funeral,

07:13.998 --> 07:16.131
I was supposed to be sucked off.

07:16.174 --> 07:17.393
Right.

07:17.437 --> 07:20.527
And you said,
"No, Thor, don't go.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.876
I love you."

07:21.919 --> 07:24.226
And then I wasn't
sucked off,

07:24.269 --> 07:26.794
and then you said, "Never mind."

07:26.837 --> 07:29.100
Okay, yeah, yeah, this is
ringing a bell. Yeah, sure.

07:29.144 --> 07:30.275
So...

07:30.319 --> 07:31.712
I was wondering if, maybe,

07:31.755 --> 07:34.236
there was truth
to the thing you said

07:34.279 --> 07:37.326
before you said, "Never mind."

07:39.284 --> 07:40.982
Yes, there was.

07:41.025 --> 07:42.331
Really?

07:42.374 --> 07:43.811
Yeah, but-but that was
when I thought

07:43.854 --> 07:45.116
I couldn't have you.

07:45.160 --> 07:49.469
So you only want Thor
if Thor not here?

07:49.512 --> 07:51.949
I have intimacy issues, man.

07:51.993 --> 07:53.734
But you had boyfriend Ira.

07:53.777 --> 07:55.823
I remember.
He run away like Dane

07:55.866 --> 07:57.564
when attacked by bear.

07:57.607 --> 08:01.002
Well, Ira and I only worked
because it was never just us.

08:01.045 --> 08:02.656
We always had a third.

08:02.699 --> 08:04.353
First, there was Phyllis,
the blanket hog.

08:04.396 --> 08:06.442
Then Dorothy,
another blanket hog.

08:06.486 --> 08:08.749
Blanket politics
are really big in throuples.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.228
The point is,

08:10.272 --> 08:11.795
we always had a buffer
to keep things

08:11.839 --> 08:13.667
from getting too intense.

08:13.710 --> 08:15.364
Sorry.

08:15.407 --> 08:19.542
Well, maybe we get buffer.

08:19.586 --> 08:21.109
Huh.

08:22.719 --> 08:24.982
But who would be the third?

08:25.722 --> 08:27.811
19th-century

08:27.855 --> 08:29.030
Jacques Bijoux.

08:29.073 --> 08:31.162
- A rare find.
- Mm-hmm.

08:31.206 --> 08:33.034
But not in great condition,
is it?

08:33.077 --> 08:34.862
What? Let me see that?

08:34.905 --> 08:36.167
Sam.

08:36.211 --> 08:37.255
I want to hear
about the old days.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.692
Bring up my name.

08:38.735 --> 08:41.085
...some nicks
- on the bezel.
- Fine. So, uh,

08:41.129 --> 08:43.218
you mentioned that
you used to hang out here

08:43.261 --> 08:44.872
with my Uncle David.

08:44.915 --> 08:48.179
Was there a guy named
Trevor Lefkowitz in your crew?

08:50.094 --> 08:51.966
Um, it's hard to say.

08:52.009 --> 08:53.881
I knew a lot of Trevors.

08:53.924 --> 08:55.404
What? We were bros.

08:55.447 --> 08:57.145
Right, i-it's just that,
you know,

08:57.188 --> 08:59.582
Uncle David did bring
his name up quite a bit.

08:59.626 --> 09:01.149
Oh, because I thought
that you said

09:01.192 --> 09:02.585
that you didn't really know
your uncle.

09:02.629 --> 09:04.935
Surely, he must remember
the night that you died.

09:04.979 --> 09:06.458
Yes. Smart.

09:06.502 --> 09:08.809
Okay, we were here to
celebrate Pinkus's promotion.

09:08.852 --> 09:11.594
- Bring that up.
- A-And where exactly is the bezel?

09:11.638 --> 09:13.161
You know, I think
that it might have been

09:13.204 --> 09:14.466
this one time you guys

09:14.510 --> 09:16.120
were all up here
for Pinkus's promotion,

09:16.164 --> 09:17.992
is what I remember my
Uncle David telling me,

09:18.035 --> 09:21.299
as a child, during
one of our few chats.

09:21.343 --> 09:22.736
Hey, babe, I think this is

09:22.779 --> 09:25.652
hardly relevant
to the negotiations at hand.

09:25.695 --> 09:28.045
Right? How is this relevant?

09:28.089 --> 09:29.307
I don't know...

09:29.351 --> 09:31.353
I'm gonna go make
a quick phone call.

09:31.396 --> 09:33.529
What are you doing?
You're blowing it.

09:33.573 --> 09:35.923
I'm sorry, but Trevor
says he knows the guy.

09:35.966 --> 09:37.359
None of this makes any sense.

09:37.402 --> 09:40.014
How does someone
not remember their best bro?

09:40.057 --> 09:43.191
Oh, well, Hamilton pretended
to not know me at a party once.

09:43.234 --> 09:45.062
And then "got my name wrong"

09:45.106 --> 09:47.325
several times over
the years after that.

09:47.369 --> 09:51.286
Classic
archrival shenanigans.

09:54.289 --> 09:55.595
What is this for?

09:55.638 --> 09:56.944
We just wanted
to ask you

09:56.987 --> 09:58.293
some questions
about yourself.

09:58.336 --> 09:59.642
Oh, well,

09:59.686 --> 10:01.426
you know I do love
talking about myself.

10:01.470 --> 10:02.950
Ask away.

10:02.993 --> 10:05.692
I would not describe myself
as a "people person," no.

10:05.735 --> 10:07.519
I mean, no,
I wouldn't say my body

10:07.563 --> 10:09.957
is particularly hairy. Why?

10:10.000 --> 10:11.698
Is this a sex thing?

10:11.741 --> 10:14.962
Am I willing to go
with the flow?

10:15.005 --> 10:16.137
No.

10:16.180 --> 10:19.227
Yeah, this is a sex thing.
I'm out.

10:20.402 --> 10:22.839
My strong suits?
Well, I'm can-do.

10:22.883 --> 10:25.842
Selfless. I tend to put
other people's desires and needs

10:25.886 --> 10:27.148
before my own.

10:27.191 --> 10:28.845
Oh, and I have excellent
hand-eye coordination.

10:28.889 --> 10:30.804
He's perfect.

10:30.847 --> 10:32.588
Great. Perfect for what?

10:34.024 --> 10:38.420
Look, I came up here to buy
a watch, and ten minutes in,

10:38.463 --> 10:40.552
she's grilling me
about a dead man.

10:40.596 --> 10:43.555
Did one of you guys snitch?
I guess I'm just

10:43.599 --> 10:45.166
kind of worried that maybe,
I don't know,

10:45.209 --> 10:46.341
I'm being blackmailed?

10:46.384 --> 10:48.169
- Blackmailed?
- This is getting interesting.

10:48.212 --> 10:51.651
No, I'm not on drugs,
but I wish that I was,

10:51.694 --> 10:54.654
'cause I'm freaking out
right now.

10:54.697 --> 10:57.961
Oh, right.
The secret drug drawer.

10:58.005 --> 11:01.443
I don't know. How long do you
think cocaine stays good for?

11:01.486 --> 11:04.489
Who would ever keep it around
long enough to find out?

11:04.533 --> 11:06.230
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

11:06.274 --> 11:08.493
What do you mean, "snitched"?
What's he talking about?

11:08.537 --> 11:10.495
He has obviously done
something nefarious.

11:10.539 --> 11:12.193
Dude is shaken.

11:12.236 --> 11:14.891
Are you telling us everything?
What really happened that night?

11:14.935 --> 11:17.328
I told you, I took some bad
pills, had totally awesome sex

11:17.372 --> 11:18.721
and then died.

11:18.765 --> 11:20.288
But I don't know
what he means by snitching.

11:20.331 --> 11:23.030
Because there's something
you don't know about that night.

11:23.073 --> 11:24.988
None of you do.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.557
Ari betrayed you, Trevor.

11:28.600 --> 11:29.906
What did he do?

11:29.950 --> 11:33.693
He's the one
who broke the bro code.

11:35.390 --> 11:37.871
Oh, come on.
That was gasp-worthy.

11:37.914 --> 11:39.133
There's something
wrong with you people.

11:44.878 --> 11:46.140
What do you mean,
Ari betrayed me?

11:46.183 --> 11:47.619
Okay, look,
something happened,

11:47.663 --> 11:49.360
and I never told you
because I know how much

11:49.404 --> 11:50.840
you loved your bros.

11:50.884 --> 11:54.322
<i>You had just died</i> <i>
and were understandably</i>

11:54.365 --> 11:55.366
<i>a little confused.</i>

11:55.410 --> 11:56.890
What the hell is going on?

11:56.933 --> 11:58.326
Who are all
you guys?

11:58.369 --> 12:00.415
We are ghosts.

12:00.458 --> 12:02.112
While most spirits
pass on,

12:02.156 --> 12:04.680
we are the unfortunate few
cursed to spend...

12:04.724 --> 12:06.769
- He's dead!
- Okay, well, I'm talking here.

12:06.813 --> 12:08.771
What the hell? This is nuts!

12:08.815 --> 12:10.251
You know,
it's a little loud in here.

12:10.294 --> 12:12.035
Maybe we do the welcoming
ceremony in another room.

12:12.079 --> 12:13.341
Why do you have an arrow
in your neck?

12:13.384 --> 12:15.517
Oh, because I'm dead.
But I'm jumping ahead.

12:15.560 --> 12:16.866
We'll get to all that.

12:16.910 --> 12:18.389
Where are your pants, man?

12:18.433 --> 12:21.218
Yeah, probably should have
kept those on. Big mistake.

12:21.262 --> 12:24.265
While everyone else left
to tend to you, I stuck around.

12:24.308 --> 12:26.658
<i>You were in good hands,</i> <i>
and I was having too much fun</i>

12:26.702 --> 12:28.617
<i>watching these jerks freak out.</i> I am not freaking out!

12:28.660 --> 12:30.488
Oh, God, what are we gonna do?

12:30.532 --> 12:31.794
Maybe we call 911?

12:31.838 --> 12:33.404
No, I am, like,
70% cocaine right now.

12:33.448 --> 12:34.536
We are not calling the cops.

12:34.579 --> 12:35.798
I can't handle going to jail.

12:35.842 --> 12:38.018
I can't handle
going to the Sheraton!

12:38.061 --> 12:39.889
There's only one way
out of this.

12:39.933 --> 12:41.456
We call our dads.

12:43.501 --> 12:45.547
They didn't even try
to help you?

12:45.590 --> 12:47.549
It gets so much worse.

12:47.592 --> 12:49.029
Okay, my dad said
we should lawyer up.

12:49.072 --> 12:50.987
We're probably gonna be fine."Probably"?

12:51.031 --> 12:52.249
My dad says hide the body.

12:52.293 --> 12:53.860
What are you talking about?

12:53.903 --> 12:55.557
We weigh it down,
drop the body in the lake

12:55.600 --> 12:57.864
and never speak of this again.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.256
Agreed?

12:59.300 --> 13:01.432
And that's exactly <i>
what they did.</i>

13:01.476 --> 13:03.521
I'm so sorry, Trevor.

13:03.565 --> 13:06.611
Okay, it's not good, obviously,
but they were scared.

13:06.655 --> 13:08.222
Trevor, stop defending them.

13:08.265 --> 13:10.441
They were kids.
Some of them were barely 30.

13:10.485 --> 13:11.747
Well, they would've
been grandparents

13:11.791 --> 13:13.053
in my day, but go on.

13:13.096 --> 13:14.881
I'm just saying,
I would've done the same thing.

13:14.924 --> 13:17.274
No, you wouldn't have, and
you know you wouldn't have,

13:17.318 --> 13:18.841
'cause you were
different from them.

13:18.885 --> 13:21.278
- How do you know?
- Because I know the story

13:21.322 --> 13:24.847
of how you really
lost your pants.

13:26.762 --> 13:30.331
Oh, come on.

13:32.942 --> 13:34.814
Congratulations, Pete.

13:34.857 --> 13:36.293
Yes, Thor also

13:36.337 --> 13:38.165
very comfortable
with new development.

13:38.208 --> 13:39.949
Not rethinking it at all.

13:39.993 --> 13:43.866
Look, truth be told, uh,
now that I'm fully up to speed

13:43.910 --> 13:45.781
on what you guys say I have won,

13:45.825 --> 13:48.131
I'm not really sure
I want the position.

13:48.175 --> 13:50.133
Oh, well, we can do
any position you want.

13:50.177 --> 13:51.831
Not what I'm saying.
Uh, I'm talking about

13:51.874 --> 13:53.963
the general position
of being the third.

13:55.399 --> 13:57.271
Maybe I could watch.
Nope. Hate that.

13:57.314 --> 13:58.446
Uh, thank you, though,

13:58.489 --> 13:59.490
and good luck.

13:59.534 --> 14:00.796
I'll be cheering you guys on.

14:00.840 --> 14:02.232
From afar.
Not from the same roo--

14:02.276 --> 14:03.843
You understand.

14:03.886 --> 14:05.714
Is it possible
that I could leave?

14:05.757 --> 14:07.890
- Thank you.
- Uh...

14:07.934 --> 14:10.850
I already told you how I lost
the pants, remember?

14:10.893 --> 14:13.069
Refractory period in between
rounds with the hot limo driver.

14:13.113 --> 14:15.289
Yeah, first of all,
you never had sex

14:15.332 --> 14:17.073
with the limo driver.

14:17.117 --> 14:18.379
Here's what really happened.

14:18.422 --> 14:20.120
Can you stop doing that?

14:21.469 --> 14:22.992
So, uh, I don't really understand.

14:23.036 --> 14:24.646
Um, the Run of Fun
is that I have to somehow

14:24.689 --> 14:27.127
make it back to the city
on foot with no money,

14:27.170 --> 14:28.432
wearing nothing but a T-shirt?

14:28.476 --> 14:29.477
Sounds like
you understand perfectly.

14:31.218 --> 14:32.523
These guys are mean.

14:32.567 --> 14:34.395
He's for sure
gonna get hypothermia.

14:35.744 --> 14:37.224
But before Pinkus left...

14:37.267 --> 14:38.399
Have fun.

14:38.442 --> 14:40.444
<i>...you tracked him down.</i>

14:40.488 --> 14:42.620
Pinkus.

14:43.578 --> 14:45.754
You don't have to do this
if you don't want to.

14:45.797 --> 14:48.017
But I really want the promotion.

14:49.105 --> 14:50.628
All right.

14:50.672 --> 14:52.587
Don't tell anybody about this.

14:52.630 --> 14:54.502
You take my money clip,
you get a cab.

14:54.545 --> 14:55.677
I want that back Monday, though.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.984
Serious? Thank you, Trevor.

14:58.027 --> 14:59.768
Oh, wait.

14:59.811 --> 15:02.162
A cab's not gonna let you in
without any pants on.

15:02.205 --> 15:05.165
I learned that the hard way
during my Run of Fun.

15:05.208 --> 15:06.601
Okay.

15:06.644 --> 15:08.168
Get out of here.

15:08.211 --> 15:11.214
Y-You're just gonna go back
in there with no pants?

15:11.258 --> 15:13.434
I'll make up
something brilliant.

15:13.477 --> 15:15.566
Wait. Take my boxers.

15:17.742 --> 15:20.136
I don't want your boys
rubbing up against my new suit.

15:20.180 --> 15:22.269
Fair enough.

15:22.312 --> 15:23.966
- Be free.
- Thank you

15:24.010 --> 15:25.968
so much.

15:30.842 --> 15:33.628
Guess who just had sex
with the hot limo driver!

15:34.846 --> 15:37.327
Trevor, you're a good guy.

15:37.371 --> 15:38.633
I had no idea.

15:38.676 --> 15:40.330
Okay, a little
less shocked would be nice.

15:40.374 --> 15:41.984
I don't understand, Sass.

15:42.028 --> 15:44.073
Why did you never call me out
about the limo driver thing?

15:44.117 --> 15:46.075
Because I knew why you lied.

15:46.119 --> 15:48.948
Helping Pinkus meant breaking
the bro code that you lived by,

15:48.991 --> 15:50.732
and I knew that was
important to you.

15:50.775 --> 15:52.081
I can't believe this.

15:52.125 --> 15:54.170
I can't believe
those guys would do that.

15:54.214 --> 15:56.042
Well, shoot, let's take them down.

15:56.085 --> 15:58.392
Tell the press. Ooh, Sam can
help us ruin their lives.

15:58.435 --> 16:00.437
That's not gonna
make me feel better.

16:00.481 --> 16:03.527
That job, those guys,
that was my world.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.442
Maybe I never had
any bros at all.

16:07.314 --> 16:10.491
Maybe my whole life was a lie.

16:13.276 --> 16:15.931
And are you sure Trevor
didn't, like, put hot sauce

16:15.975 --> 16:17.498
in the man's pants to
burn the guy's wiener?

16:22.982 --> 16:24.766
I wish there was something
we could do

16:24.809 --> 16:25.941
to make Trevor feel better.

16:25.985 --> 16:27.421
Well, he said
he didn't want revenge,

16:27.464 --> 16:29.901
so we just have to honor that.

16:29.945 --> 16:32.556
No, he said he didn't
want to ruin their lives.

16:32.600 --> 16:35.255
But I have another idea
to get revenge.

16:35.298 --> 16:39.607
And it is super douchey,
so he's gonna love it.

16:39.650 --> 16:41.609
I don't know
if you're distracted

16:41.652 --> 16:43.741
or if you're <i>Art of War-ing</i> me
with your negotiation tactics,

16:43.785 --> 16:45.917
but I'll tell you what,
you're good.

16:45.961 --> 16:48.442
Bro, I'm not even thinking
about the watch right now.

16:48.485 --> 16:50.183
Okay, 80% off, final offer.

16:50.226 --> 16:52.228
Hey, how's it going in here?

16:52.272 --> 16:53.664
I got him right
where I want him.

16:53.708 --> 16:55.318
Ari, uh, could I talk
to Jay for a second?

16:55.362 --> 16:56.711
You can wait in the living room.

16:56.754 --> 16:57.799
Oh, yeah, of course.

16:57.842 --> 16:58.800
You can talk to Jay
all you want.

16:58.843 --> 17:00.106
Wh-What do you guys want

17:00.149 --> 17:01.542
to talk about, exactly?
Is it about me?

17:01.585 --> 17:03.457
'Cause if it's about me,
I feel like I should know.

17:03.500 --> 17:04.980
Where were you just now?

17:05.024 --> 17:07.765
Just took a walk,
down by the lake.

17:08.723 --> 17:10.072
Oh, that's lovely.

17:10.116 --> 17:11.900
I-I didn't even know
that you had a lake here.

17:11.943 --> 17:14.250
I'll be in the living room.

17:14.294 --> 17:16.383
What is going on?

17:16.426 --> 17:19.734
Ghost stuff. We just have to
wait in here for a few minutes.

17:20.822 --> 17:22.693
Good news, I have a surprise.

17:22.737 --> 17:24.130
Oh, really?

17:24.173 --> 17:25.783
Uh, what is it?

17:25.827 --> 17:29.004
Well, I was getting the sense
that you were a little nervous

17:29.048 --> 17:31.006
about the whole
"finding a third" thing.

17:31.050 --> 17:32.660
- Maybe a little.
- But, of course,

17:32.703 --> 17:36.664
I still have my hang-ups about
the whole one-on-one thing,

17:36.707 --> 17:38.187
so I found a compromise.

17:38.231 --> 17:40.320
It's Crash's body.

17:40.363 --> 17:42.844
Oh, yes, it, uh... That...

17:42.887 --> 17:45.194
Surprise.

17:45.238 --> 17:47.109
Well, I figured this is, like,
a happy medium.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.329
The two-and-a-half solution,
if you will.

17:51.940 --> 17:53.985
Okay, I cannot do this.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.683
No, no, no,
he's cool with it. Watch.

17:55.726 --> 17:57.772
Yeah, you're cool
with that, right? Yeah.

17:57.815 --> 17:59.121
He's cool with it.

17:59.165 --> 18:00.731
Yeah-- Wait, no,
wh-where you going?

18:00.775 --> 18:02.994
It's not that. Look,

18:03.038 --> 18:06.172
if you not okay with just Thor,
I understand,

18:06.215 --> 18:10.524
but if it is more time you need
to feel comfortable,

18:10.567 --> 18:12.526
I can wait.

18:12.569 --> 18:14.049
Really?

18:14.093 --> 18:16.051
I've been here a thousand years.

18:16.095 --> 18:18.401
Only met you 50 years ago.

18:18.445 --> 18:20.577
Blink of an eye.

18:20.621 --> 18:23.711
So we can wait
till moment is right.

18:23.754 --> 18:26.322
But it might be a long time.

18:26.366 --> 18:31.458
Thor think that maybe
Flower worth the wait.

18:31.501 --> 18:33.721
Aw.

18:34.722 --> 18:37.725
Okay, we should get out of here.
I think I got it revved up.

18:37.768 --> 18:39.727
Flattered, but, uh,
no, thank you.

18:39.770 --> 18:42.686
Nice to see you.

18:46.125 --> 18:48.562
Uh, why are you
bringing me in here? I...

18:48.605 --> 18:49.867
No.

18:49.911 --> 18:51.217
I don't want to look
at this guy.

18:51.260 --> 18:53.871
Trevor, you thought
you did not have bros,

18:53.915 --> 18:55.177
but you are mistaken.

18:55.221 --> 18:58.180
You have bros. And we are they.

18:58.224 --> 18:59.877
Enjoy.

18:59.921 --> 19:01.792
What did you guys do?

19:01.836 --> 19:03.098
Oh, just watch.

19:03.142 --> 19:04.795
- Y'all think he's gonna do it?
- Trust me.

19:04.839 --> 19:07.189
This'll work.
There you go.

19:07.233 --> 19:08.408
Go to the drug drawer.

19:08.451 --> 19:10.714
There you go.

19:10.758 --> 19:11.976
Right thereRight there.

19:12.020 --> 19:13.195
Oh, you're so close.
Do it.

19:13.239 --> 19:15.197
Do it, do it, do it...

19:19.723 --> 19:22.465
"I know what you did.

19:22.509 --> 19:24.206
T-Money"?

19:24.250 --> 19:27.253
Oh, my God, you guys.

19:27.296 --> 19:30.256
I believe some sort
of celebratory declaration

19:30.299 --> 19:31.735
is in order?

19:35.391 --> 19:40.309
Ari Cantor, I've waited
20 years to say this to you.

19:40.353 --> 19:42.920
You just got chilled. Boom!

19:42.964 --> 19:44.444
Come on!

19:44.487 --> 19:45.880
Yeah! Yeah!
Yeah!

19:45.923 --> 19:48.448
Is, uh, everything okay?

19:48.491 --> 19:51.015
Um, look...

19:51.059 --> 19:53.453
I don't know what kind
of sick game this is,

19:53.496 --> 19:55.063
but how about this?

19:55.106 --> 19:58.153
I'll pay you double what
you're asking for the watch,

19:58.197 --> 20:01.635
and we agree to never speak
of this again.

20:01.678 --> 20:03.985
Deal. No take-backs.

20:04.028 --> 20:06.466
See? Told you your hubs
could handle it.

20:06.509 --> 20:08.294
Good job, babe. Say, Ari,

20:08.337 --> 20:09.860
is that a Chekhov Chill?

20:09.904 --> 20:11.645
When you find one of those,
aren't you supposed

20:11.688 --> 20:13.603
to do something with it?

20:13.647 --> 20:15.170
Ooh...

20:15.214 --> 20:16.084
Seriously?

20:16.127 --> 20:19.261
I don't make the rules... bro.

20:20.958 --> 20:23.265
Get down. Down.

20:25.049 --> 20:27.182
Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug,

20:29.489 --> 20:32.013
chug, chug, chug,
chug, chug, chug, chug,

20:32.056 --> 20:33.667
chug, chug, chug, chug, chug...

20:35.538 --> 20:37.975
Yeah! That was the best!

20:38.019 --> 20:39.629
That was the most amazing thing.
