09:44.116 --> 09:47.553
here to present you with your
very own fairy god parents

09:47.620 --> 09:49.822
to grant you your every wish.

09:49.889 --> 09:53.626
Chloe, meet Wanda and Cosmo.

09:53.693 --> 09:56.996
- I'm Wanda.
- I'm Wanda.

09:57.063 --> 09:59.765
Aw, I practiced that, too.

09:59.832 --> 10:04.670
{\an1}- Whoa, wait.
I have fairy god parents?

10:04.737 --> 10:08.074
{\an1}Excuse me, I need
a moment alone.

10:11.310 --> 10:16.248
Yeeeesssss!

10:20.119 --> 10:23.222
{\an1}Sorry, I went a little cray-cray
there, but I'm good now.

10:23.289 --> 10:26.092
One thing. It feels unfair
that I have two fairies.

10:26.158 --> 10:27.827
Shouldn't I share them?

10:27.893 --> 10:30.196
- Oh, come on!

10:30.262 --> 10:32.498
{\an3}- You are sharing them
with Turner.

10:32.565 --> 10:35.267
{\an3}And technically
you don't have two fairies.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.403
It's more like
a fairy and a half.

10:37.470 --> 10:39.705
- Ooh, I'm the half.
Right, Wanda?

10:39.772 --> 10:42.208
- Yes, you are, sweetie.
- I knew it!

10:42.274 --> 10:45.111
- You kids figure out how
to divvy up your fairies.

10:45.177 --> 10:48.414
I'm off to the hospital
to get my windpipe replaced.

10:48.481 --> 10:51.617
{\an3}- So, Chloe, are you ready
to make your first wish?

10:51.684 --> 10:52.918
- First, I just want to say

10:52.985 --> 10:55.021
{\an1}I'm so excited
to meet you guys, and--

10:55.087 --> 10:56.856
- Time's up. My turn!

10:56.922 --> 11:00.493
I wish I was as far away
from Chloe as possible.

11:03.429 --> 11:06.999
[growling]

11:07.066 --> 11:08.034
- Where are we?

11:08.100 --> 11:10.102
- Center of the Earth, Timmy.

11:10.169 --> 11:12.438
Realm of
the hideous mole people.

11:12.505 --> 11:15.708
It's as far from Chloe
as possible.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.543
{\an1}- It's what you wished for,
Timmy.

11:17.610 --> 11:18.577
You're welcome.

11:18.644 --> 11:19.712
Selfie with the mole people!

11:19.779 --> 11:22.181
Duck lips!

11:22.248 --> 11:23.716
Wanda, take another one of me

11:23.783 --> 11:27.553
{\an3}with the bleached bones
of those who came before us.

11:27.620 --> 11:29.255
[growling]

11:29.321 --> 11:30.923
Quick, Wanda,
get a shot of me and Timmy

11:30.990 --> 11:33.392
as they drag him
to the boiling pot.

11:36.429 --> 11:38.531
- [screaming]

11:38.597 --> 11:42.401
Back! Back! Bad mole.

11:42.468 --> 11:44.770
- Here's the evil mole people
seasoning Timmy

11:44.837 --> 11:46.539
with a garlic-coriander rub.

11:46.605 --> 11:49.508
And here's my Spanish omelette
from yesterday.

11:49.575 --> 11:50.810
- Thanks a lot, guys.

11:50.876 --> 11:53.479
{\an3}I was almost enslaved
by human-rodent hybrids.

11:53.546 --> 11:55.314
- Oh, you think
you've got problems.

11:55.381 --> 11:57.783
I blinked in my
bleached bones selfie.

11:57.850 --> 12:01.654
{\an3}- Anyway, I think I know how
to handle this sh--sh--shooing.

12:01.720 --> 12:03.789
{\an3}Chloe, just pick the day
when you want the fairies.

12:03.856 --> 12:07.093
{\an1}- Super! I'll take Friday
because there's no homework.

12:07.159 --> 12:09.028
Although, sometimes
I do extra credit.

12:09.095 --> 12:10.329
I don't know what I like better,

12:10.396 --> 12:12.098
making wishes
or doing extra credit.

12:12.164 --> 12:15.201
Ooh, I just don't know!

12:15.267 --> 12:17.736
- Stop it! Stop it!
You called Fridays!

12:17.803 --> 12:21.640
{\an3}Cosmo, Wanda, I wish there were
no such thing as Fridays!

12:24.076 --> 12:26.445
- [cackling]

12:26.512 --> 12:31.317
Timmy Turner! Happy The Day
Formerly Known as Friday!

12:31.383 --> 12:33.853
Once again, your careless wishes
have set into motion

12:33.919 --> 12:35.187
a chain of events
that will result

12:35.254 --> 12:37.590
in the ultimate destruction
of Earth!

12:37.656 --> 12:39.391
Evil laugh! Cackle guffaw!

12:39.458 --> 12:42.495
Oh, hello, little girl!
We are unacquainted as of yet.

12:42.561 --> 12:44.330
Here, take my card.

12:44.396 --> 12:46.265
- "Foop. Enemy of Fairy World.

12:46.332 --> 12:48.200
"Bringer of woe.
Harbinger of doom.

12:48.267 --> 12:49.835
Lose weight.
Ask me how."

12:49.902 --> 12:51.704
Oh, excuse me, Mr. Foop?

12:51.770 --> 12:53.005
You spelled "doom" wrong.

12:53.072 --> 12:54.640
{\an3}- Oh, thank you
for pointing that out.

12:54.707 --> 12:56.242
I'll show my gratitude
by making sure

12:56.308 --> 12:59.411
you experience
a particularly painful death.

12:59.478 --> 13:03.082
Sorry, I'm a little cranky.
Got a new tooth coming in.

13:03.149 --> 13:06.952
[cackling]

13:07.019 --> 13:10.156
[screaming]

13:13.225 --> 13:15.261
{\an3}- How did my one little
no-Friday wish

13:15.327 --> 13:17.530
{\an3}make all this
terrible stuff happen?

13:17.596 --> 13:20.533
- Oh, sweet, naive,
simple-minded Timmy.

13:20.599 --> 13:23.335
{\an3}Don't you get it?
'Cause, I don't get it. Wanda?

13:23.402 --> 13:27.273
- Every Friday, the big wand
in Fairy World gets recharged

13:27.339 --> 13:31.076
{\an1}and its power protects Dimmsdale
from the anti-fairies.

13:31.143 --> 13:35.214
Now that Fridays don't exist,
the wand hasn't been charged.

13:35.281 --> 13:38.184
- You lost me at "every."
End of the world selfie!

13:38.250 --> 13:40.419
OMG! Smiley face emoticon.

13:40.486 --> 13:41.654
- [cackles]

13:41.720 --> 13:44.924
All of you, prepare
to meet your doom.

13:44.990 --> 13:47.126
And feel the wrath of my baba!

13:47.193 --> 13:49.228
It's filled with
chocolate milk...

13:49.295 --> 13:51.830
heated to a million degrees!

13:51.897 --> 13:53.499
[screaming]

13:53.566 --> 13:57.036
- Wanda, Cosmo, you still have
some magic left in your wands?

13:57.102 --> 13:58.537
- I've got two bars, Timmy.

13:58.604 --> 14:01.040
But I think I should
save them for an emergency.

14:01.106 --> 14:03.943
- I wish Fridays existed again.

14:04.009 --> 14:07.146
{\an3}- [cackles]

14:08.180 --> 14:11.050
[screaming]

14:11.116 --> 14:13.352
both: Aaah!

14:18.524 --> 14:19.758
- First of all,

14:19.825 --> 14:23.662
let it be Friday again.

14:23.729 --> 14:26.632
all : Yay! TGIF!

14:26.699 --> 14:28.234
- Secondly, Turner,

14:28.300 --> 14:31.437
you need to accept the fact that
you're sharing your fairies,

14:31.503 --> 14:34.640
or you can re-visit
your little furry friends.

14:34.707 --> 14:35.674
{\an3}[growling]

14:35.741 --> 14:37.243
{\an3}- [screams]

14:37.309 --> 14:40.179
Okay, fine, I'll do the thing
I can't say.

14:40.246 --> 14:41.914
But I want something
to replace my fairies

14:41.981 --> 14:43.415
when they're with Chloe.

14:43.482 --> 14:45.451
I wish for a fairy-bot
that will do all the stuff

14:45.517 --> 14:47.186
I don't want to do.

14:47.253 --> 14:50.656
{\an1}- Boy, that's
a whole lot of stuff.

14:50.723 --> 14:54.059
- Just do it!

14:54.126 --> 14:58.197
{\an1}<i>- Hello, Timmy Turner.</i>
<i>I am Fairy-bot.</i>

14:58.264 --> 15:01.734
{\an1}<i>Would you like me</i>
<i>to gently brush your hair?</i>

15:01.800 --> 15:04.870
- What? No, ew.
Definitely not.

15:04.937 --> 15:08.240
<i>- Let's go.</i>

15:08.307 --> 15:11.510
<i>Time for your bath.</i>

15:11.577 --> 15:16.081
{\an3}- Uh, guys?

15:16.148 --> 15:20.419
- Aw, I feel sorry for Timmy.
It's so hard for him to share.

15:20.486 --> 15:22.121
I guess sharing's hard
for everybody.

15:22.187 --> 15:25.658
[gasps] Ooh, that's
a good idea for my first wish.

15:25.724 --> 15:26.792
Ready, guys?

15:26.859 --> 15:28.160
both: Ready, Chloe.

15:28.227 --> 15:30.796
- I wish everyone in Dimmsdale

15:30.863 --> 15:33.432
would share everything.

15:33.499 --> 15:35.567
- Aw, that's lovely, Chloe.

15:35.634 --> 15:40.773
{\an1}A wish that will make
the world a better place.

15:40.839 --> 15:42.141
{\an3}- [whining]

15:42.207 --> 15:46.912
{\an1}- Huh, I just got the urge
to share my chainsaw.

15:46.979 --> 15:47.913
{\an1}- Thanks.

15:47.980 --> 15:50.549
[both laugh maniacally]

15:50.616 --> 15:53.485
- Okay, Fairy-bot.
I'm clean already.

15:53.552 --> 15:56.488
It's snack time.
Give me some pizza.

15:56.555 --> 15:58.957
{\an3}<i>- Malfunction.</i>
<i>Malfunction. Malfunction.</i>

15:59.024 --> 16:01.393
- [screams]

16:01.460 --> 16:03.462
-<i> This is Chet Ubetcha</i>
<i>with breaking news.</i>

16:03.529 --> 16:05.764
As if by magic, suddenly
everyone in Dimmsdale

16:05.831 --> 16:07.066
is sharing everything.

16:07.132 --> 16:09.435
In other news,
this scary man in a hockey mask

16:09.501 --> 16:13.739
wants to share my desk.

16:13.806 --> 16:15.040
Which is okay by me!

16:15.107 --> 16:16.408
- Oh, Timmy.

16:16.475 --> 16:18.477
{\an1}That foxy she-devil
that lives with us now

16:18.544 --> 16:20.913
shared her beauty tips with me.

16:20.979 --> 16:23.015
- And he shared his money.

16:23.082 --> 16:24.850
- Don't tell my wife.

16:24.917 --> 16:27.152
Ooh, I'm so pretty.

16:27.219 --> 16:30.456
I'm giving me the tingles!

16:30.522 --> 16:32.758
{\an3}- Huh, I've seen my dad
in a dress before,

16:32.825 --> 16:35.728
{\an3}but I've never seen him
sh--sh--sh his money.

16:35.794 --> 16:39.064
{\an3}And I suddenly have the urge
to give away all my video games.

16:39.131 --> 16:41.066
Wait! I feel like
sh--sh--shooing.

16:41.133 --> 16:44.970
What's happening? Cosmo! Wanda!

16:45.037 --> 16:48.807
Did Chloe make some kind of
crazy, goody-two-shoes wish?

16:48.874 --> 16:50.676
{\an3}- She made
a perfectly lovely wish

16:50.743 --> 16:53.545
{\an3}that everyone
would share everything.

16:53.612 --> 16:55.180
- Oh, that can't end well.

16:55.247 --> 16:58.517
[screaming]

17:00.953 --> 17:03.655
{\an1}- Thanks for sharing your car,
Mrs. and Mrs. Turner.

17:03.722 --> 17:05.790
In return, I'd like
to share Mother!

17:05.858 --> 17:08.394
I've been blessed
with the gift of giving.

17:08.460 --> 17:10.128
- Oh, Denzel.

17:10.194 --> 17:11.530
- [laughs]

17:11.597 --> 17:14.400
- Oh, boy. Chloe really
blew it with this wish.

17:14.465 --> 17:16.101
- Preach it, Timmy.

17:16.167 --> 17:19.171
'Cause you never made a wish
that went horribly wrong.

17:19.238 --> 17:20.204
<i>- Bath time!</i>

17:20.271 --> 17:22.875
[screaming]

17:22.941 --> 17:25.676
[grunting]

17:25.743 --> 17:28.981
{\an3}- Enough is enough!
I unwish Chloe's wish.

17:29.048 --> 17:30.449
- You can't, Sport.

17:30.516 --> 17:32.384
It's against the rules
for a fairy god kid

17:32.451 --> 17:35.120
to unwish another
fairy god kid's wish.

17:35.187 --> 17:37.556
{\an3}- Chloe!
Unwish your nut job wish!

17:37.623 --> 17:39.758
{\an1}- That's a little judgy.
It was a good wish.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.927
Everyone's just in sort of
a transitional period

17:41.994 --> 17:44.530
while they adjust to the idea
of being, you know,

17:44.596 --> 17:45.964
a little less selfish.

17:46.031 --> 17:47.199
[truck beeps]

17:47.266 --> 17:48.534
Hey, that's my house!

17:48.600 --> 17:53.439
{\an3}That weirdo is
stealing my house.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.941
{\an1}Okay, I admit it.
It was a nut job wish.

17:56.008 --> 17:58.243
I should have done a little more
thinking before I made it.

17:58.310 --> 18:01.246
{\an3}- Take it from me, thinking
doesn't solve anything.

18:01.313 --> 18:02.581
- Amen, brother.

18:02.648 --> 18:05.017
- Just unwish your wish.
- Okay.

18:05.083 --> 18:07.386
Wanda, and Cosmo,
I wish everything was back

18:07.453 --> 18:11.423
to the way it was
before I made my wish.

18:11.490 --> 18:13.625
- I think I'll share
this fire hydrant.

18:13.692 --> 18:16.328
We don't have one on our block.

18:16.395 --> 18:19.531
[screaming]

18:20.966 --> 18:25.204
[growling]

18:25.270 --> 18:29.007
- People of the daylight,
prepare to share your bounty!

18:29.074 --> 18:30.843
And your bleached bones!

18:30.909 --> 18:31.910
[screaming]

18:31.977 --> 18:34.613
{\an1}- Oh, no.
It's happening again.

18:34.680 --> 18:37.983
I try to do something good
and I end up making a big mess.

18:38.050 --> 18:41.119
- What are you talking about?
You're Little Miss Perfect.

18:41.186 --> 18:44.056
- Not exactly, Sport.

18:44.122 --> 18:45.724
Roll the clip.

18:45.791 --> 18:47.626
-<i> It's okay,</i>
<i>Mr. Radiation Monster.</i>

18:47.693 --> 18:50.095
<i>I accept you</i>
<i>for who you are:</i>

18:50.162 --> 18:53.065
<i>a foul-smelling thing</i>
<i>that crawled out of the bay</i>

18:53.131 --> 18:55.467
<i>to destroy our city.</i>

18:55.534 --> 18:57.169
- [sobbing]

18:57.236 --> 19:01.006
You really get me.

19:01.073 --> 19:06.211
And now that my foot is healed,
I can destroy the city.

19:06.278 --> 19:08.981
Roar, man!

19:09.047 --> 19:11.517
- See? I try too hard
to fix things

19:11.583 --> 19:14.253
and I end up annoying people,
destroying cities,

19:14.319 --> 19:16.555
and then no one
wants to be my friend.

19:16.622 --> 19:18.957
{\an3}- Oh, come on.
That's not true.

19:19.024 --> 19:20.859
{\an1}- Really? Do you want
to be my friend?

19:20.926 --> 19:22.694
{\an3}- Uh, sure.

19:22.761 --> 19:25.731
{\an3}- That's not what you told me,
Timmy. Roll the clip.

19:25.797 --> 19:28.267
-<i> I will never be</i>
<i>Chloe's friend.</i>

19:28.333 --> 19:29.968
{\an3}<i>- [humming]</i>

19:30.035 --> 19:33.138
- I was talking about
a different Chloe.

19:33.205 --> 19:35.641
Uh, Chloe Van...notyouwitz.

19:35.707 --> 19:37.643
{\an3}Anyway, sorry
I hurt your feelings.

19:37.709 --> 19:39.745
{\an3}And I understand
why you have fairies now.

19:39.811 --> 19:41.813
{\an3}Your life isn't so perfect
after all.

19:41.880 --> 19:43.749
{\an1}- [laughs] I can be
kind of a train wreck.

19:43.815 --> 19:46.718
{\an1}You know, sometimes I just want
to be a regular, average kid.

19:46.785 --> 19:49.087
{\an1}Maybe then people
would understand me.

19:49.154 --> 19:52.791
{\an3}- Well, I am just an average kid
that no one understands.

19:52.858 --> 19:55.594
[growling]
[all scream]

19:57.629 --> 19:59.998
- Help!
- Gotcha.

20:00.065 --> 20:04.403
{\an3}- Wow, Timmy. You saved me.
That was so brave.

20:04.469 --> 20:07.606
{\an1}- Well, I am kind of a hero.
Nothing scares me.

20:07.673 --> 20:12.244
{\an1}<i>- I brought you an apple,</i>
<i>Mr. Crocker.</i>

20:12.311 --> 20:14.212
- Aah, I'm scared!

20:14.279 --> 20:16.815
- Ooh, ohh, I'm coming, Timmy.

20:16.882 --> 20:18.183
Boy, that's a long way down.

20:18.250 --> 20:19.785
I better energize myself
with a healthy snack.

20:19.851 --> 20:21.520
Ooh, kale's a super food.

20:21.587 --> 20:26.191
- Still falling!

20:26.258 --> 20:29.127
Aah!

20:29.194 --> 20:30.762
[weeping]

20:30.829 --> 20:32.965
- Don't cry, Timmy.
I've got you.

20:33.031 --> 20:37.269
- I'm not crying. Someone must
be peeling an onion down here.

20:37.336 --> 20:41.773
- Come on, Timmy. Hop on my back
and I'll rappel us back up.

20:43.408 --> 20:45.010
[screaming]

20:45.077 --> 20:47.045
[growling]

20:47.112 --> 20:48.480
Cosmo! Wanda!

20:48.547 --> 20:52.718
{\an1}To reiterate, I wish everything
was back to the way it was

20:52.784 --> 20:54.920
before I made my wish.

20:54.987 --> 20:56.989
[growling]

21:00.092 --> 21:01.493
- We went too far back!

21:01.560 --> 21:04.630
- My bad. You really gotta
spell things out with me.

21:04.696 --> 21:06.398
Remember, I'm the half.

21:06.465 --> 21:08.700
- Okay, here's the deal.

21:08.767 --> 21:11.269
I wish everything
was back to the way it was

21:11.336 --> 21:14.940
just before I made my wish.

21:16.908 --> 21:19.678
- Oh, Timmy!

21:19.745 --> 21:24.116
{\an3}Good news. This foxy siren
is actually your mother.

21:24.182 --> 21:26.184
{\an3}I know! I didn't believe it
either.

21:26.251 --> 21:29.054
{\an3}- Really, Dad?
How'd you figure it out?

21:29.121 --> 21:30.188
- I made him lunch.

21:30.255 --> 21:32.424
- And it was
so uniquely terrible

21:32.491 --> 21:34.059
that I knew it had to be her.

21:34.126 --> 21:36.228
Oh, I'm so happy she's back.

21:36.294 --> 21:39.431
[sobbing]

21:39.498 --> 21:44.036
Oh, my mascara's running.
I'm a piping hot mess.

21:46.471 --> 21:50.008
{\an1}- You know what? I think
I'm officially done with wishes.

21:50.075 --> 21:52.277
You can have
your fairies back, Timmy.

21:52.344 --> 21:56.014
{\an3}- Don't tell Timmy,
but I'm secretly disappointed.

21:56.081 --> 21:57.683
- I am Timmy.

21:57.749 --> 21:59.351
And there's no reason
to be disappointed.

21:59.418 --> 22:03.055
Because of your wish, Chloe,
I had a pretty exciting day.

22:03.121 --> 22:07.626
{\an3}And from now on I'm actually
going to sh--sh--share

22:07.693 --> 22:09.828
my fairies with you.

22:09.895 --> 22:11.063
{\an1}- Really?

22:11.129 --> 22:15.901
{\an1}Excuse me, I need
a moment alone.

22:15.967 --> 22:20.906
Yeeessss!

22:22.074 --> 22:24.643
{\an3}Okay, I'm good now.
[giggles]

22:24.710 --> 22:26.211
Timmy, we could be BFFs.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.980
{\an1}We can hang out, do homework,
community service!

22:29.047 --> 22:32.050
Ooh, community service
really gets me jazzed.

22:32.117 --> 22:35.821
{\an3}- Okay, tap the brakes
a little, Chloe.

22:35.887 --> 22:38.724
- BFF selfie.
Duck lips!

22:38.790 --> 22:40.459
- Photo bomb. Quack!

22:40.525 --> 22:42.794
Hey, who bought
this fancy candle?
