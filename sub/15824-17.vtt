WEBVTT

00:05.539 --> 00:08.309
Flynn: YOUR CELLPHONE'S
BEEN RINGING ALL DAY.

00:08.342 --> 00:09.543
WHY DON'T YOU PICK IT UP?

00:09.577 --> 00:10.778
Provenza:
'CAUSE I KNOW WHO'S CALLING,

00:10.811 --> 00:12.313
AND I DON'T
WANT TO TALK TO HER.

00:12.346 --> 00:14.082
YEAH, BUT WHAT IF
IT'S AN EMERGENCY?

00:14.115 --> 00:17.085
THEN SHE OUGHT TO CALL 911,
NOT ME.

00:17.118 --> 00:19.220
FLYNN, HEY.

00:19.253 --> 00:21.422
WHY DON'T WE, UH,
GO DOWN TO McCLURE'S

00:21.455 --> 00:23.191
FOR THE EARLY-BIRD
SPECIAL?

00:23.224 --> 00:25.326
YOU KNOW, HANG OUT AT THE BAR
FOR THE GAME.

00:25.359 --> 00:28.096
HANG OUT AT THE BAR.
SO, WHAT'S IN IT FOR ME?

00:28.129 --> 00:29.630
YOU CAN WATCH ME
GET DRUNK.

00:29.663 --> 00:32.166
YOU KNOW, UH,
CARPOOLING HAS ITS TRADE-OFFS.

00:32.200 --> 00:33.434
IF YOU LIVE YOUR LIFE
ON THE WAGON,

00:33.467 --> 00:36.237
NOW AND THEN
YOU HAVE TO DRIVE IT.

00:38.839 --> 00:42.276
STOP CALLING ME.

00:42.310 --> 00:44.845
EXCUSE ME,
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA, SIR.

00:46.347 --> 00:48.116
THERE'S SOMEONE HERE
TO SEE YOU.

00:48.149 --> 00:50.084
Liz:
WHAT'S THE MATTER, LOUIE?

00:50.118 --> 00:51.685
YOUR PHONE DOESN'T SOUND
BROKEN TO ME.

00:51.719 --> 00:53.554
LIZ.

00:54.755 --> 00:56.624
I CALLED YOU
A MILLION TIMES.

00:56.657 --> 00:58.326
Buzz: WHICH WIFE IS LIZ, AGAIN?
HIS THIRD?

00:58.359 --> 01:00.594
I TOLD YOU, NO FAMILY AT WORK
UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES.

01:00.628 --> 01:01.829
THAT'S DEFINITELY
HEATHER.

01:01.862 --> 01:04.732
NOT OUR KIDS,
NOT OUR GRANDKIDS,

01:04.765 --> 01:06.267
AND CERTAINLY NOT YOU.

01:06.300 --> 01:08.236
YOU WANT TO TALK TO ME,
CALL ME AT HOME.

01:08.269 --> 01:09.637
ME AND FLYNN
ARE OUT OF HERE.

01:09.670 --> 01:11.705
"FLYNN AND I."
"FLYNN AND I ARE OUT OF HERE."

01:11.739 --> 01:12.873
LOUIE,
THIS IS AN EMERGENCY.

01:12.906 --> 01:14.475
CORRECTING HIS GRAMMAR.

01:14.508 --> 01:16.844
WOW.
HIS VERY FIRST EX.

01:16.877 --> 01:19.713
Provenza: OKAY, LIZ.
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

01:21.549 --> 01:22.683
I HAD TO SELL
MY WEDDING RING.

01:22.716 --> 01:24.685
AND IN OUR
DIVORCE SETTLEMENT,

01:24.718 --> 01:26.220
IT SAYS YOU PAID
$500 FOR IT.

01:26.254 --> 01:29.223
WAIT A MINUTE.
YOU SOLD OUR WEDDING RING?

01:29.257 --> 01:31.859
AND DO YOU KNOW HOW MUCH
I GOT FOR IT, LOUIE?

01:33.527 --> 01:34.628
$49?

01:34.662 --> 01:36.597
UH-HUH. $49.

01:36.630 --> 01:40.901
YOU MAILED THE RING
TO A PLACE CALLED GOLDIBUCKS?!

01:40.934 --> 01:43.637
GOLDIBUCKS IS A LEGITIMATE
BUSINESS. THEY ADVERTISE ON TV.

01:43.671 --> 01:46.240
AND, FRANKLY,
I HAVE TO HAVE THE MONEY. NOW.

01:47.408 --> 01:49.543
HEY, LIZ.
IS EVERYTHING OKAY?

01:49.577 --> 01:51.145
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S FRANK.

01:51.179 --> 01:52.646
HE'S SICK.

01:52.680 --> 01:57.351
HIS ASTHMA IS GETTING WORSE.
HE NEEDS INSULIN TWICE A DAY.

01:57.385 --> 01:59.720
HIS BLOOD PRESSURE
IS THROUGH THE ROOF,

01:59.753 --> 02:00.854
AND IT'S GETTING
HARDER AND HARDER

02:00.888 --> 02:01.922
TO PAY FOR HIS
PRESCRIPTIONS.

02:01.955 --> 02:03.391
OH, LIZ, I'M SO SORRY.

02:03.424 --> 02:05.726
FLYNN.
FRANK IS JUST A DOG.

02:05.759 --> 02:09.430
WOULD YOU CALL HIM "JUST A DOG"
IN FRONT OF YOUR GRANDKIDS?

02:09.463 --> 02:13.467
LIZ, PLEASE. GOD, DON'T
START AN ARGUMENT HERE.

02:13.501 --> 02:15.536
WE FINALLY FOUND
AN ARRANGEMENT

02:15.569 --> 02:18.239
THAT MAKES OUR RELATIONSHIP
VERY STRONG.

02:18.272 --> 02:20.474
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
WE BARELY SEE EACH OTHER.

02:20.508 --> 02:22.510
THAT'S THE ARRANGEMENT.
LOOK, LOOK.

02:22.543 --> 02:24.712
I FOUND THE ADDRESS
FOR THIS GOLDIBUCKS PLACE.

02:24.745 --> 02:26.480
IT'S ONLY
10 MINUTES FROM HERE.

02:26.514 --> 02:28.716
WE'LL GO DOWN THERE RIGHT NOW
AND GET THE RING BACK,

02:28.749 --> 02:30.384
WHICH I CAN'T BELIEVE
YOU SOLD.

02:30.418 --> 02:33.221
DOESN'T OUR WEDDING RING
MEAN ANYTHING TO YOU AT ALL?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.488
OF COURSE IT DOES.

02:34.522 --> 02:36.590
HERE, I'LL SHOW YOU
WHAT IT MEANS.

02:40.894 --> 02:43.431
YOU KNOW, YOU'RE RIGHT, LIZ.
FRANK DOESN'T SOUND TOO GOOD.

02:43.464 --> 02:47.501
DOESN'T LOOK SO HOT, EITHER.
THIS DOG'S STILL UGLY AS SIN.

02:47.535 --> 02:49.470
WHAT CAN I SAY?
I HAVE A TYPE.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.207
BUT THANK YOU FOR TAKING ME
TO THE GOLD STORE

02:53.241 --> 02:54.908
IN AN ACTUAL POLICE CAR.

02:54.942 --> 02:56.510
AH.

02:56.544 --> 02:57.711
YOU KNOW, IN THE 10 YEARS
LOUIE AND I WERE MARRIED,

02:57.745 --> 02:58.979
HE NEVER ONCE
LET ME DO A RIDE-ALONG.

02:59.012 --> 03:00.681
REALLY?

03:02.483 --> 03:03.951
WANT TO TURN ON
THE SIREN?

03:03.984 --> 03:06.720
COULD I?
OH, GOD.

03:06.754 --> 03:08.622
YEAH, YEAH. JUST
HIT THAT SWITCH RIGHT THERE.

03:10.558 --> 03:11.959
OH, NO, NO, NO, NO.
FRANK, BABY, CALM DOWN.

03:11.992 --> 03:14.462
YEAH, YEAH, TURN THAT OFF.
DON'T GET OVEREXCITED.

03:14.495 --> 03:16.597
TURN THAT DAMN SIREN OFF!
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

03:16.630 --> 03:19.267
THAT DOG!
I GOT IT, I GOT IT,
I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

03:19.300 --> 03:21.435
EASY BACK THERE.
THINK ABOUT YOUR BLOOD PRESSURE.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.471
YOU BETTER BE
TALKING TO THIS DOG.

03:23.504 --> 03:25.739
IT'S NICE TO SEE HE WASN'T JUST
AN ASSHOLE AT HOME.

03:25.773 --> 03:28.008
OH, YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

03:36.384 --> 03:39.019
COME ON, BABY.
COME ON.

03:39.052 --> 03:41.789
SO, WHAT'S THE PLAN?

03:41.822 --> 03:44.992
THE PLAN IS TO GIVE WHATEVER
SCAM ARTIST OWNS THIS PLACE

03:45.025 --> 03:46.960
A GOOD OLD-FASHIONED
WHAT FOR!

03:46.994 --> 03:48.929

IF THERE'S ANYTHING I CAN DO.

04:07.515 --> 04:09.383
Liz: ARE YOU
ALLOWED TO SHOW YOUR BADGE?

04:09.417 --> 04:12.286
I DON'T WANT YOU
BREAKING ANY LAWS.

04:12.320 --> 04:13.987
THE CONSTITUTION DEMANDS

04:14.021 --> 04:15.489

BUSINESS ON A LEGAL CALL, YOU --

04:15.523 --> 04:17.024

WITH ALL THAT RACKET?

04:27.335 --> 04:28.602
IT'S JUST TEMPORARY.

04:28.636 --> 04:30.070

A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM.

04:30.103 --> 04:34.007
YEAH, SO, WHAT EXACTLY
CAN I HELP YOU GUYS WITH?

04:34.041 --> 04:36.710

05:10.944 --> 05:14.582

05:47.981 --> 05:50.518
WHO WILL GIVE US
WHAT THE RING IS ACTUALLY WORTH.

05:50.551 --> 05:52.686
ONE MINUTE.
FRANK NEEDS TO STRETCH HIS LEGS.

05:52.720 --> 05:55.423
HIS LEGS
ARE 5 INCHES LONG.

05:55.456 --> 05:57.124
DO YOU HEAR HOW BAD
FRANK IS WHEEZING?

05:57.157 --> 05:58.859
JUST WRITE HER A CHECK,

05:58.892 --> 06:01.595
I'VE WRITTEN HER
473 CHECKS.

06:01.629 --> 06:04.097
I BOUGHT THE HOUSE
THAT SHE AND THAT DOG LIVE IN.

06:04.131 --> 06:05.699
NO MORE CHECKS.

06:05.733 --> 06:08.135
LOUIE? ISN'T THAT THE WOMAN
WHO WAS HELPING US?

06:21.148 --> 06:23.751
SHE SAID
THEY WERE LOCKING UP.

06:25.152 --> 06:28.489
WHOA, WHOA.
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

06:36.597 --> 06:39.132
ALL THE JEWELRY --
IT'S GONE.

06:39.166 --> 06:40.868
OH, GOD.

06:40.901 --> 06:42.603
DON'T JUMP
TO ANY CONCLUSIONS.

06:42.636 --> 06:44.438
Liz:

06:44.472 --> 06:46.173
LIZ, LIZ,
FOR HEAVEN'S SAKES!
FRANK, COME BACK!

06:46.206 --> 06:49.477
THAT WOMAN,
SHE PULLED OFF A GLOVE.

06:49.510 --> 06:50.544
DON'T EAT THAT, FRANK.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.651
NO, FRANK.
GIVE ME THE GLOVE.

06:57.685 --> 07:00.053
OH, NO, FRANK.

07:04.091 --> 07:05.959
FRANK. FRANK, FRANKIE.
COME ON, FRANK. NO.

07:08.028 --> 07:10.598
THAT RUBBER GLOVE
WAS WORN

07:10.631 --> 07:13.000
BY A ROBBER IN A ROBBERY
THAT WE LET HAPPEN.

07:13.033 --> 07:14.868
NO, NO, NO, NO.

07:14.902 --> 07:16.103
SMALL-TIME ROBBERY.
NO BIG DEAL.

07:42.996 --> 07:44.698
CHIEF --
NO.

07:44.732 --> 07:47.267
NOT YET.

07:47.300 --> 07:48.769
LIEUTENANT TAO?

07:48.802 --> 07:50.738
VICTIM'S NAME TAG READS
"MILO BILLINGS."

07:50.771 --> 07:52.840
HIS FACEBOOK PAGE
IS UP ON HIS COMPUTER --

07:52.873 --> 07:54.642
SAYS HE'S 64 YEARS OLD.

07:54.675 --> 07:57.611
I DIDN'T SEE ANY WOUNDS,
BUT KENDALL FOUND BROKEN RIBS.

07:57.645 --> 07:59.513
MAYBE IT WAS CARDIAC ARREST
DURING THE ROBBERY,

07:59.547 --> 08:00.748
WHICH WOULD MAKE THIS
MURDER.

08:00.781 --> 08:01.915
IF I COULD JUST
EXPLAIN --

08:01.949 --> 08:03.917
I SAID...NOT YET.

08:03.951 --> 08:05.118
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

08:05.152 --> 08:07.187
Gabriel:
YEAH, WELL, UH, MILO'S NAME

THESE BUSINESS DOCUMENTS.

08:08.689 --> 08:10.924
THEY HAVE HIM LISTED HERE
AS THE OWNER.

08:10.958 --> 08:14.094
YEAH, WELL, I CAN --
WHAT PART OF "NOT YET"

08:14.127 --> 08:16.229
ARE YOU MISUNDERSTANDING?

08:17.230 --> 08:19.066
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.634
YOU SEE THE CORDS,
CHIEF?

08:20.668 --> 08:22.603
Buzz: THESE FEED
FROM FOUR SECURITY CAMERAS

08:22.636 --> 08:25.739
CONNECTED TO A HARD DRIVE
THAT USED TO BE THERE.

08:25.773 --> 08:28.241
WELL, AT LEAST
WE WON'T HAVE TO WATCH

08:28.275 --> 08:30.277
VIDEO OF YOU TWO
ON THE NEWS

08:30.310 --> 08:34.047
IGNORING A ROBBERY
AND A MURDER.

08:34.081 --> 08:36.750
OKAY, YOUR TURN.
WHAT HAPPENED?

08:36.784 --> 08:38.251
OKAY, CHIEF,
WHEN WE ARRIVED HERE,

08:38.285 --> 08:40.087
THERE WAS A GIRL
BEHIND THE COUNTER,

08:40.120 --> 08:42.623
WHO WE THOUGHT WAS AN EMPLOYEE,
PACKING UP FOR THE NIGHT.

08:42.656 --> 08:44.057
SHE WAS PACKING UP,
ALL RIGHT.

08:44.091 --> 08:47.127
AND NEITHER OF YOU SAW
OR HEARD ANYTHING

08:47.160 --> 08:50.864
THAT WOULD INDICATE
THERE WAS A ROBBERY GOING ON?

08:56.036 --> 08:59.239
THEY WERE DRILLING THE SAFE
WHILE YOU WERE HERE?!

08:59.272 --> 09:00.941
OKAY, IN OUR DEFENSE,
CHIEF,

09:00.974 --> 09:03.711
THE GIRL SAID SHE WAS INSTALLING
A NEW SECURITY SYSTEM.

09:03.744 --> 09:04.945
DOES SHE HAVE A NAME?

09:06.780 --> 09:08.682
HOW ABOUT A DESCRIPTION?

09:08.716 --> 09:11.218
OH, WELL, UH,
SHE WAS PRETTY.

09:11.251 --> 09:13.120
UH, YEAH. SEXY, EVEN.

09:13.153 --> 09:16.056
YEAH, SHE WAS CUTE.
NICE LEGS.

09:16.089 --> 09:20.961
YEAH.
SHE WAS 5'9",
LOOKED BETWEEN 28 AND 32,

09:20.994 --> 09:22.195
WORE A BRUNETTE WIG,

09:22.229 --> 09:24.131
BLUE EYES --
COULD HAVE BEEN CONTACTS.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.166
THE ONLY TIME
WE SAW HER MALE PARTNER

09:26.199 --> 09:27.768
WAS WHEN
THEY WERE RUNNING AWAY.

09:27.801 --> 09:32.606
UH, CHIEF,
THIS IS MY FIRST EX-WIFE, LIZ,

09:32.640 --> 09:34.241
AND --
AND HER DOG, FRANK.

09:34.274 --> 09:37.044
WE CAME HERE TO GET BACK A RING
THAT SHE SOLD BY MAIL.

09:37.077 --> 09:38.846
IT'S A PLEASURE, LIZ,

09:38.879 --> 09:40.748
AND...FRANK.

09:40.781 --> 09:42.249
THERE IS SOME GOOD NEWS,
CHIEF.

09:42.282 --> 09:44.818
THE FEMALE THIEF,
SHE DROPPED A LATEX GLOVE.

09:44.852 --> 09:46.253
NOW, WITH ANY LUCK,

09:46.286 --> 09:48.622
WE'LL BE ABLE TO GET A PRINT
OFF THE INSIDE OF IT.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.023
OKAY.
WHERE'S THE GLOVE?

09:50.057 --> 09:52.860
WELL, IT'S, UH,
TEMPORARILY UNAVAILABLE,

09:52.893 --> 09:55.729
BUT I ASSURE YOU IT WILL SHOW UP
IN A DAY OR SO.

09:56.864 --> 09:57.965
THE DOG, UH...

09:57.998 --> 09:59.199
FRANK ATE THE GLOVE.

09:59.232 --> 10:00.801
SHUT UP, FRANK.

10:00.834 --> 10:03.737
LIEUTENANT TAO,
DO YOU THINK IT'S POSSIBLE

10:03.771 --> 10:06.707
THAT THE GLOVE WILL MAKE IT
THROUGH IN A USABLE FASHION?

10:06.740 --> 10:09.977
DRUG MULES USE BALLOONS
MADE OUT OF THIS
MATERIAL ALL THE TIME.

10:10.010 --> 10:11.712
ALL RIGHT, LOOK, UH...

10:11.745 --> 10:12.813
WE NEED TO HANG ON TO FRANK
HERE, SO --

10:12.846 --> 10:14.347
Liz:
YOU CAN'T HOLD FRANK.

10:14.381 --> 10:16.917
HE HAS A DOCTOR'S APPOINTMENT
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.886
THIS IS A VIOLATION
OF HIS CIVIL RIGHTS.

10:18.919 --> 10:20.654
LIZ.

10:20.688 --> 10:24.357
LIZ, DOGS DO NOT HAVE
CIVIL RIGHTS.
THEIR OWNERS DO.

10:24.391 --> 10:25.826
YOU CAN'T IMPOUND MY DOG
WITHOUT MY PERMISSION.

10:25.859 --> 10:28.361
ALL RIGHT, LOOK --
WE NEED TO KEEP FRANK,

10:28.395 --> 10:34.167
SO, LIZ, MAYBE YOU COULD STAY
WITH US, TOO, IF YOU DON'T MIND?

10:34.201 --> 10:35.903
I'LL HELP
ANY WAY I CAN.

10:35.936 --> 10:38.138
FRANK TRULY NEEDS SOMEONE
WHO WILL PAY ATTENTION TO HIM.

10:38.171 --> 10:40.941
CHIEF,
I FOUND A SEARCH WARRANT.

10:40.974 --> 10:43.711
SO YOU CAME HERE WITH
YOUR EX

10:43.744 --> 10:44.945
Flynn:
NO, NO. WAIT A MINUTE.

10:44.978 --> 10:46.814
THAT -- THAT'S NOT
OUR WARRANT, NO.

10:46.847 --> 10:49.683
UH, CHIEF, I DON'T THINK
THIS WARRANT IS LEGIT.

10:49.717 --> 10:50.951
WHY?

10:50.984 --> 10:53.721
BECAUSE IT'S SIGNED
BY A JUDGE JUDY.

10:53.754 --> 10:55.388
Raydor: THE SUSPECTS
IDENTIFIED THEMSELVES

10:55.422 --> 10:57.958
AS L.A.P.D. OFFICERS
WITH BADGES AND GUNS.

10:57.991 --> 10:59.226
THEY PRODUCE A WARRANT,

10:59.259 --> 11:01.428
THEY SEIZE
ALL THE GOLD IN THE STORE,

11:01.461 --> 11:04.064
SAYING THAT THEY NEED TO EXAMINE
IT FOR STOLEN PROPERTY,

11:04.097 --> 11:05.733
THEN THEY TAKE
THE SURVEILLANCE FOOTAGE,

11:05.766 --> 11:07.768
AND I KNOW ALL THIS

11:07.801 --> 11:10.070
BECAUSE PSB HAS BEEN
INVESTIGATING THESE ROBBERIES

11:10.103 --> 11:11.772
FOR THREE MONTHS.

11:11.805 --> 11:13.774
IT STILL DOESN'T MEAN
THESE GUYS ARE COPS.

11:13.807 --> 11:16.109
ANYONE CAN DOWNLOAD A WARRANT
OFF THE INTERNET.

11:16.143 --> 11:17.911
BUT THE WARRANT
THAT WAS LEFT BEHIND TODAY

11:17.945 --> 11:19.980
DEMONSTRATES A PROFESSIONAL
UNDERSTANDING OF THE LAW,

11:20.013 --> 11:22.082
AND I CAN'T AFFORD
TO JUST HOPE

11:22.115 --> 11:24.852
THAT THESE PEOPLE ARE THIEVES
IMPERSONATING OFFICERS.

11:24.885 --> 11:26.920
SHE'S RIGHT.
SHE CAN'T.

11:26.954 --> 11:29.222
SO, THE CASE BELONGS
TO PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.691
I SEE NO REASON
FOR MAJOR CRIMES TO BE INVOLVED.

11:32.760 --> 11:34.227
EXCUSE ME?

11:34.261 --> 11:36.029
YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
CHIEF JOHNSON'S SIDE OF THINGS.

11:36.063 --> 11:38.799
THIS ROBBERY WAS SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT THAN THE OTHERS,

11:38.832 --> 11:40.968
WHICH IS WHY I THINK THAT
CHIEF JOHNSON AND MAJOR CRIMES

11:41.001 --> 11:42.102
SHOULD BE INVOLVED.

11:42.135 --> 11:44.004
SIGNIFICANTLY
DIFFERENT HOW?

11:44.037 --> 11:46.974
THE THIEVES WERE INTERRUPTED
AND LEFT THEIR TOOLS BEHIND.

11:47.007 --> 11:48.208
INTERRUPTED BY WHOM?

11:48.241 --> 11:49.843
I'LL GET BACK TO THAT.

11:49.877 --> 11:52.279
LIEUTENANTS
FLYNN AND PROVENZA.

11:53.881 --> 11:55.248
AND THERE WAS A MURDER.

11:55.282 --> 11:57.284
I THOUGHT THE VICTIM DIED
OF A HEART ATTACK.

11:57.317 --> 11:59.052
DURING THE COMMISSION
OF A FELONY, WHICH
MAKES THIS A MURDER.

12:01.188 --> 12:03.456
IS THERE ANY WAY I CAN JUST
AVOID ASKING THIS QUESTION?

12:03.490 --> 12:04.792
NO.

12:04.825 --> 12:06.193
NO, THERE ISN'T.

12:06.226 --> 12:08.195
OKAY.

12:08.228 --> 12:11.364
FLYNN AND PROVENZA
WITNESSED A ROBBERY/MURDER

12:11.398 --> 12:15.903
WITHOUT STOPPING IT
OR COLLECTING ANY EVIDENCE?

12:15.936 --> 12:18.205
UH, THE FEMALE ROBBER
TOOK OFF HER LATEX GLOVE.

12:18.238 --> 12:19.840
SO WE DO HAVE
FINGERPRINTS?

12:19.873 --> 12:21.174
WE'RE HAVING TO WAIT
ON THAT.

12:21.208 --> 12:22.976
WHY ARE WE WAITING?
I'M THE CHIEF OF POLICE.

12:23.010 --> 12:25.913
I'LL CALL THE PRINTS SECTION,
AND WE'LL PUT A RUSH ON IT.

12:25.946 --> 12:27.380
THE GLOVE IS NOT
WITH PRINTS SECTION.

12:27.414 --> 12:30.383
OF COURSE NOT.

12:30.417 --> 12:32.052
WHERE IS IT?

12:32.085 --> 12:33.954
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA'S
EX-WIFE LIZ

12:33.987 --> 12:36.990
WAS WITH HIM AT THE STORE,
AND HER DOG, FRANK.

12:37.024 --> 12:40.994
FRANK GOT TO THE GLOVE
FIRST AND...

12:41.028 --> 12:42.996
CONSUMED IT.

12:46.566 --> 12:51.438
SO, IF I'M UNDERSTANDING YOU
CORRECTLY, AND I FEAR THAT I DO,

12:51.471 --> 12:55.575
LIEUTENANT PROVENZA'S
EX-WIFE'S DOG...

12:55.608 --> 12:57.577
ATE THE EVIDENCE.

12:57.610 --> 13:00.814
AND WE'RE -- WE'RE
HAVING TO WAIT FOR IT TO...

13:00.848 --> 13:02.249
REAPPEAR.

13:03.917 --> 13:05.819
ALL RIGHT, YOU KNOW WHAT,
CAPTAIN?

13:05.853 --> 13:08.021
IF THIS IS WHAT YOU REALLY WANT,
THEN FINE.

13:08.055 --> 13:09.990
YOU CONTINUE INVESTIGATING
THE ROBBERIES,

13:10.023 --> 13:12.192
AND MAJOR CRIMES
CAN HANDLE THE HOMICIDE.

13:12.225 --> 13:14.361
BUT I WANT YOU,
CHIEF JOHNSON,

13:14.394 --> 13:18.165
TO WORK TOGETHER
AND TO SHARE INFORMATION.

13:18.198 --> 13:21.468
AND PLEASE REMEMBER HOW THE
WORDS "TOGETHER" AND "SHARE"

13:21.501 --> 13:22.802
ARE TRADITIONALLY DEFINED.

13:27.140 --> 13:29.509
Brenda: WHEN WILL FRANK
BE DONE WITH THE GLOVE?

13:29.542 --> 13:30.944
SOMETIME
IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS,

13:30.978 --> 13:32.545
ACCORDING TO
DR. MORALES' BEST GUESS.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.215
IS THERE ANY WAY
TO SPEED THIS UP?

13:35.248 --> 13:36.583
LAXATIVES.

13:36.616 --> 13:38.218
FRANK'S TOO SICK FOR THAT.

13:38.251 --> 13:40.553
ALL RIGHT, THEN.
WE WAIT.

13:40.587 --> 13:43.290
SO, WHAT DO WE KNOW
ABOUT OUR VICTIM, MILO BILLINGS?

13:43.323 --> 13:45.325
OKAY, HE'S BEEN ARRESTED
A COUPLE TIMES

13:45.358 --> 13:48.161
OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS,
MOSTLY LOW-LEVEL CON JOBS.

13:48.195 --> 13:50.263
HE'S BASICALLY
A STREET-SCAM ARTIST.

13:50.297 --> 13:52.900
MILO FOUND A WAY TO STEAL
WITH A STOREFRONT.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.634
SO HE DECIDED TO CASH IN
ON THE GOLD CRAZE.

13:54.667 --> 13:56.103
SO HE AND HIS PARTNER,
JERRY COOPER,

13:56.136 --> 13:58.305
THEY OPENED UP GOLDIBUCKS
TWO YEARS AGO.

13:58.338 --> 14:01.408
YEAH, PREYING ON DESPERATE,
GULLIBLE DIVORCéES.

14:01.441 --> 14:04.177
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT
YOUR DATING LIFE?

14:04.945 --> 14:07.948
UH, DETECTIVE GABRIEL, I NEED TO
SPEAK TO THE VICTIM'S PARTNER,

14:07.981 --> 14:10.117
JERRY COOPER, AS QUICKLY
AS POSSIBLE, PLEASE.

14:10.150 --> 14:11.584
HELLO, EVERYONE.

14:11.618 --> 14:14.454
IN THE INTEREST OF SHARING,
HERE'S ALL THE INFO

14:14.487 --> 14:16.189
ON THE PREVIOUS
GOLD-STORE ROBBERIES

14:16.223 --> 14:19.059
THAT PSB's
BEEN WORKING ON.

14:19.092 --> 14:21.428
WE HAVEN'T BEEN ABLE TO IDENTIFY
THE THIEVES,

14:21.461 --> 14:23.096
SO WE'RE CALLING THEM
BONNIE AND CLYDE.

14:23.130 --> 14:24.932
DID YOU GUYS CHECK
YOUR STOLEN-INVENTORY LIST

14:24.965 --> 14:26.199
WITH PAWNSHOPS, MA'AM?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.201
YES, BUT NOTHING'S
TURNED UP SO FAR.

14:28.235 --> 14:31.104
GOLD HAS AN EXTREMELY LOW
MELTING POINT.

14:31.138 --> 14:33.173
ALL BONNIE AND CLYDE
WOULD NEED

14:33.206 --> 14:35.242
IS A POT, A BLOWTORCH,
AND SOME BORAX

14:35.275 --> 14:37.644
TO TURN THEIR LOOT
INTO GOLD BARS.

14:37.677 --> 14:40.513
WHY DON'T YOU LET ME TAKE CARE
OF WHERE THE GOLD GOES,

14:40.547 --> 14:42.482
AND YOU CONCENTRATE
ON THE MURDER?

14:42.515 --> 14:44.151
IT'S ALL ONE THING
TO ME.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.585
LOOK, IF WE DON'T
GO ABOUT THIS PROPERTY,

14:45.618 --> 14:47.587
THE THIEVES WILL SAY
THAT THE VICTIM WAS DEAD

14:47.620 --> 14:49.122
WHEN THEY
BROKE INTO THE STORE

14:49.156 --> 14:50.557
AND THAT THEY
TRIED TO REVIVE HIM.

14:50.590 --> 14:52.459
WE HAVE TO GET
THE RIGHT KIND OF CONFESSION

14:52.492 --> 14:53.460
TO CALL THIS A MURDER.

14:53.493 --> 14:54.962
Gabriel: UH, CHIEF?

14:54.995 --> 14:56.129
THE VICTIM'S PARTNER,
JERRY COOPER --

14:56.163 --> 14:57.330
HE'S ON HIS WAY UP.

14:57.364 --> 14:58.498
DO YOU WANT HIM
IN INTERVIEW ROOM 1?

14:58.531 --> 15:00.100
YOU FOUND MR. COOPER
ALREADY?

15:00.133 --> 15:01.701
NO, I DIDN'T FIND HIM.
HE CAME IN ON HIS OWN.

15:01.734 --> 15:04.204
OH, ALL RIGHT, THEN.
I GUESS I'LL GO TALK TO HIM.

15:04.237 --> 15:08.608
CHIEF, SHOULDN'T I INTERVIEW
THIS PERSON WITH YOU?

15:08.641 --> 15:12.145
UH, WHY DON'T YOU GO ON AHEAD,
AND I'LL BE RIGHT THERE.

15:12.179 --> 15:14.681
THANK YOU.

15:16.583 --> 15:20.587
WHY DO YOU THINK MR. COOPER
SHOWED UP HERE ON HIS OWN?

15:20.620 --> 15:23.223
BECAUSE MILO SAID
THE COPS RAIDED US.

15:23.256 --> 15:24.624
MILO SAID THAT?

15:24.657 --> 15:26.126
WHEN DID YOU TALK
TO MR. BILLINGS?

15:26.159 --> 15:27.460
WELL, I WAS ON THE PHONE
WITH HIM

15:27.494 --> 15:30.197
WHEN THE COPS
CAME INTO OUR STORE.

15:31.298 --> 15:33.500
LISTEN TO ME --
"OUR STORE."

15:33.533 --> 15:35.402
TECHNICALLY,
WE'RE 50/50,

15:35.435 --> 15:38.405
BUT I'D SAY
MILO WAS MORE IN CHARGE,

15:38.438 --> 15:41.241
IF YOU HAD TO PICK, LIKE,
A TOTALLY RESPONSIBLE PARTY.

15:41.274 --> 15:47.014
SO IF THERE WERE THINGS THAT
DIDN'T BELONG AT GOLDIBUCKS,

15:47.047 --> 15:49.282
THEY'RE MILO'S.

15:49.316 --> 15:52.119
I WOULDN'T EVEN KNOW
ABOUT THEM.

15:52.152 --> 15:56.156
MR. COOPER, WHAT EXACTLY DID
MILO SAY TO YOU ON THE PHONE?

15:56.189 --> 15:58.625
THAT TWO COPS WERE IN THE STORE
WITH A WARRANT,

15:58.658 --> 16:00.593
INSISTING
WE HAD STOLEN PROPERTY,

16:00.627 --> 16:04.464
WHICH, IF WE DID,
THAT WOULD BE MILO'S.

16:04.497 --> 16:06.433
THIS IS VERY IMPORTANT,
MR. COOPER.

16:06.466 --> 16:10.403
DID MILO DESCRIBE THE POLICE
OFFICERS WHO ENTERED YOUR STORE?

16:10.437 --> 16:13.173
JUST THAT THEY WERE
A MAN AND A WOMAN.

16:13.206 --> 16:15.442
WHY AREN'T YOU ASKING MILO
WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE?

16:15.475 --> 16:16.509
HE WAS THERE.

16:17.710 --> 16:21.548
MR. COOPER, I'M SORRY TO INFORM
YOU THAT YOUR PARTNER, MILO,

16:21.581 --> 16:25.252
DIED OF A HEART ATTACK TODAY
WHEN YOUR STORE WAS ROBBED.

16:28.255 --> 16:29.522
WHAT?

16:31.191 --> 16:33.626
YOU'RE T-T...
TELLING ME...

16:40.500 --> 16:42.335
WE WERE ROBBED?!

16:42.369 --> 16:44.071
OH, MY GOD.

16:44.104 --> 16:47.274
TELL ME.
WHAT DID THEY TAKE?

16:47.307 --> 16:48.575
DID YOU HEAR THE PART

16:48.608 --> 16:51.578
ABOUT YOUR PARTNER DYING
OF A HEART ATTACK?

16:51.611 --> 16:53.480
YEAH, YEAH. VERY SAD.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.415
HIS DIET,
YOU WOULDN'T BELIEVE,

16:55.448 --> 16:59.152
BUT THE INVENTORY --
WHAT'S MISSING?

17:00.220 --> 17:01.621
OH, MY GOD.

17:01.654 --> 17:05.625
IT -- IT LOOKS LIKE EVERYTHING
IN THE DISPLAY CASES.

17:05.658 --> 17:08.395
OKAY,
THAT'S NOT SO BAD.

17:08.428 --> 17:10.263
WE'RE INSURED FOR THAT.

17:10.297 --> 17:11.398
WHAT ELSE?

17:11.431 --> 17:12.599
THE STUFF
IN THE BACK ROOM.

17:12.632 --> 17:14.367
THE BACK ROOM?!

17:14.401 --> 17:20.273
THAT'S WORSE,
BUT ALSO INSURED.

17:20.307 --> 17:21.808
AND?

17:21.841 --> 17:23.610
THE SAFE WAS CLEARED OUT.

17:23.643 --> 17:26.279
THEY TOOK EVERYTHING
IN THE SAFE?

17:26.313 --> 17:27.380
NOT THE SAFE.

17:30.617 --> 17:32.119
OH, MY GOD.

17:32.152 --> 17:34.487
MR. COOPER,
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE?

17:34.521 --> 17:36.789
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE?

17:41.661 --> 17:45.365
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE?

17:45.398 --> 17:47.800
UH, UM...

17:51.904 --> 17:53.873
NOTHING MUCH.

17:53.906 --> 17:58.278
MY PERSONAL VALUABLES,
A BASEBALL CARD,

17:58.311 --> 18:00.813
MY BIRTH CERTIFICATE...

18:00.847 --> 18:04.884
A PICTURE OF ME
WITH BRUCE WILLIS.

18:04.917 --> 18:09.356
DO YOU HAVE
A VALIUM OR A XANAX?

18:09.389 --> 18:13.326
LIKE THE 50-MILLIGRAM KIND
I TAKE WHEN MY PARENTS VISIT?

18:13.360 --> 18:16.329
BUZZ, CAN YOU, UH, PUT ME
THROUGH TO THE CHIEF, PLEASE?

18:16.363 --> 18:18.498
SURE THING.

18:18.531 --> 18:20.233
UH, CHIEF,
I NEED TO TALK TO YOU

18:20.267 --> 18:23.770
ABOUT SOME OF GOLDIBUCKS'
RECENT FINANCIAL TRANSACTIONS.

18:23.803 --> 18:28.375
OKAY, YOU -- YOU HAVE TO HELP ME
GET MY STUFF BACK.

18:28.408 --> 18:31.911
I NEED TO GO ON THE NEWS,
TALK TO THE ROBBERS.

18:31.944 --> 18:35.282
YOU LET VICTIMS DO THAT,
RIGHT?

18:35.315 --> 18:39.252
WHEN THEY'VE LOST A CHILD,
MR. COOPER, NOT A BRACELET.

18:39.286 --> 18:42.289
MR. COOPER, IF THERE WAS
SOMETHING SPECIFIC IN THAT SAFE,

18:42.322 --> 18:44.824
SOMETHING UNIQUE,
AND YOU COULD DESCRIBE IT TO US,

18:44.857 --> 18:48.495
WE WOULD HAVE A MUCH BETTER
CHANCE OF FINDING THOSE THIEVES.

18:48.528 --> 18:53.500
SO, IF YOU DO FIND MY STUFF,
YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT ALL OF IT?

18:53.533 --> 18:56.303
YOU CAN'T JUST
H

18:56.336 --> 18:59.272
CAPTAIN RAYDOR, WHY DON'T YOU
EXPLAIN TO JERRY HERE

18:59.306 --> 19:02.675
HOW HE IS NOW IN THE CENTER
OF OUR ONGOING INVESTIGATION.

19:02.709 --> 19:03.810
PARDON ME.

19:06.713 --> 19:10.817
Raydor: WE BELIEVE THAT THE
PEOPLE WHO ROBBED GOLDIBUCKS

19:10.850 --> 19:14.187
ARE EITHER
POLICE IMPERSONATORS

19:14.221 --> 19:17.490
OR POLICE OFFICERS
ACTING ILLEGALLY.

19:17.524 --> 19:21.628
WELL, THAT'S EVEN MORE
AGAINST THE LAW. ISN'T IT?

19:21.661 --> 19:23.596
WHAT'S THIS GUY'S
CRIMINAL RECORD?

19:25.432 --> 19:28.435
OKAY, SO,
FINANCIALS FOR GOLDIBUCKS

19:28.468 --> 19:29.836
WERE PRETTY CONSISTENT

19:29.869 --> 19:31.604
UP UNTIL ABOUT A WEEK AGO,
WHEN THEY RECEIVED

19:31.638 --> 19:33.373
A HALF-MILLION-DOLLAR
WIRE TRANSFER

19:33.406 --> 19:34.507
FROM THE CAYMAN ISLANDS.

19:34.541 --> 19:36.476
FREEZE THOSE ACCOUNTS,
DETECTIVE.

19:36.509 --> 19:38.478
THAT MONEY IS CONNECTED
TO SOMETHING THAT WAS IN
THE GOLDIBUCKS SAFE,

19:38.511 --> 19:39.779
SOMETHING THAT JERRY
CLEARLY WANTS,

19:39.812 --> 19:41.948
AND IT'S NOT
HIS BRUCE WILLIS PHOTO.

19:41.981 --> 19:43.950
UM, JERRY HAS NO
CRIMINAL OR VIOLENT HISTORY,

19:43.983 --> 19:45.718
AND RAYDOR
HAS BEEN TELLING HIM

19:45.752 --> 19:47.754
THAT POLICE OFFICERS
MIGHT BE INVOLVED.

19:47.787 --> 19:49.289
I'M LISTENING,
LIEUTENANT.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.624
WELL, IF -- IF YOU NEED
A DIRTY COP, CHIEF,

19:51.658 --> 19:52.925
I'M AT YOUR SERVICE.

19:52.959 --> 19:56.396
WELL, I COULD DIRECT JERRY
TO YOUR HOUSE,

19:56.429 --> 19:58.665
BUT HE'LL BE SHOWING UP
TO MAKE A DEAL

19:58.698 --> 20:02.902
WITH A CROOKED COP
AND HIS FEMALE PARTNER.

20:02.935 --> 20:06.706
OH, NO. NEVER.
NOT -- NOT IN A MILLION YEARS.

20:06.739 --> 20:08.508
I SPENT 10 YEARS IN
THE SAME HOUSE WITH THAT WOMAN,

20:08.541 --> 20:10.977
AND -- AND
THAT IS JUST NEVER --

20:11.010 --> 20:12.712
YOU HAVE NO CHOICE.

20:12.745 --> 20:14.381
LIEUTENANT, RIGHT NOW,
WHERE YOU GO, FRANK GOES,

20:14.414 --> 20:17.417
AND WHERE FRANK GOES...

20:19.319 --> 20:23.323
LOUIE, I SWEAR, I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU LIVE WITH THIS SMELL.

20:23.356 --> 20:27.860
THIS SMELL IS YOUR DOG.

20:27.894 --> 20:29.996
ALL I'M GETTING
IS WHEEZING.

20:31.631 --> 20:34.334
I WILL ADMIT, LOUIE,
THERE ARE TIMES I MISS YOU --

20:34.367 --> 20:37.036
WHEN WE GET TOGETHER
WITH OUR KIDS AND OUR GRANDKIDS

20:37.069 --> 20:38.971
AND YOU LAUGH.

20:39.005 --> 20:41.974
I ALWAYS DID LOVE YOUR LAUGH.

20:42.008 --> 20:43.576
IT MIGHT HAVE BEEN
INTERESTING

20:43.610 --> 20:45.478
TO HAVE GOTTEN THROUGH
THE ROUGH PATCHES

20:45.512 --> 20:47.380
JUST TO SEE
HOW WE WOULD HAVE ENDED UP.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.881
WELL...

20:48.915 --> 20:50.750
AND THERE ARE PARTS OF OUR
RELATIONSHIP THAT ALWAYS WORKED.

20:50.783 --> 20:52.419
OH, YEAH. MM.

20:52.452 --> 20:55.688
AND I'M SURE THERE MUST BE
THINGS YOU MISS ABOUT ME, TOO.

20:55.722 --> 20:59.326
OH, YES, OF COURSE.

20:59.359 --> 21:01.628
UH, LOOK.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.034
I CAN SHOW YOU RIGHT NOW
WHAT I MISS THE MOST.

21:08.067 --> 21:11.003
I TURNED OFF THE WIRE.
WE'RE ALONE.

21:11.037 --> 21:13.005
I COULD
KILL THE LIGHTS.

21:13.039 --> 21:17.009
AND WE PROBABLY GOT
A GOOD FIVE MINUTES.

21:17.043 --> 21:19.712
AND WHAT WOULD WE DO
WITH THE OTHER FOUR?

21:34.894 --> 21:37.897
JERRY'S APPROACHING
THE HOUSE.

21:43.970 --> 21:45.705
HERE WE GO.

21:45.738 --> 21:46.706
OKAY.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.475
I'VE GOT AUDIO NOW.

21:50.710 --> 21:52.645
YES

21:52.679 --> 21:53.880
JERRY COOPER.

21:53.913 --> 21:56.683
Y-YOU ROBBED
MY STORE TODAY.

21:58.451 --> 22:00.587
OH, GOD.
DON'T BEAT ME UP.

22:00.620 --> 22:02.622
I'M HERE
TO OFFER YOU A DEAL.

22:02.655 --> 22:04.524
GET IN HERE!

22:06.993 --> 22:09.662
GET UP HERE.
GOOD BOY.

22:09.696 --> 22:12.365
ALL RIGHT, HE'S NOT
WEARING A WIRE. NO WIRES.

22:12.399 --> 22:15.868
HE'S NOT CARRYING A GUN,
SO TAKE YOUR POSITIONS.

22:15.902 --> 22:17.069
ALL RIGHT, SIT.

22:17.103 --> 22:18.037
SIT DOWN IN THIS CHAIR
RIGHT NOW!

22:19.305 --> 22:22.041
WHAT ARE YOU DOING
AT MY HOUSE, ACCUSING
ME OF BEING A ROBBER?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.610
GOD, NO, NO, NO.

22:23.643 --> 22:25.645
I DON'T CARE WHAT YOU DID
AT GOLDIBUCKS TODAY.

22:25.678 --> 22:26.813
I'M INSURED.

22:26.846 --> 22:30.450
AND SO
MY BUSINESS PARTNER DIED.

22:30.483 --> 22:32.519
HE WAS A CRIMINAL, LIKE YOU.

22:33.420 --> 22:37.624
NO OFFENSE. I AM JUST
AN UNEMPLOYED APPRAISER

22:37.657 --> 22:39.792
WHO GOT CAUGHT UP
IN THE WRONG CROWD,

22:39.826 --> 22:42.629
AND ALL I NEED, REALLY,
IS FOR YOU TO GIVE ME BACK

22:42.662 --> 22:45.798
TWO LITTLE THINGS YOU STOLE,
BEFORE YOU MELT THE REST DOWN.

22:45.832 --> 22:46.999
WHICH TWO LITTLE THINGS?

22:47.033 --> 22:51.404
GOOD. SEE?
WE'RE ALREADY BARGAINING.

22:51.438 --> 22:52.772
THAT'S GREAT.

22:52.805 --> 22:54.574
ALL RIGHT,
I SHOULD TELL YOU

22:54.607 --> 22:59.446
THAT FOR THOSE TWO LITTLE
THINGS, I WILL PAY YOU $10,000.

22:59.479 --> 23:02.515
$10,000?

23:02.549 --> 23:05.418
OKAY, OKAY.
$25,000. $25,000.

23:05.452 --> 23:08.721
WHAT TWO ITEMS
ARE WE TALKING ABOUT?

23:08.755 --> 23:11.190
THAT WAS QUICK.
WHAT ARE WE DEALING WITH HERE?

23:11.223 --> 23:14.494
SHOW ME WHAT YOU STOLE,
AND I'LL PICK THEM OUT.

23:14.527 --> 23:17.497
OH, NO. NO.
YOU'RE TRYING TO LOWBALL US.

23:17.530 --> 23:20.166
ALL RIGHT, LIZ.
MELT EVERYTHING.

23:20.199 --> 23:22.034
D-D-DON'T DO THAT!

23:22.068 --> 23:26.005
YOU DON'T KNOW THE VALUE
OF WHAT YOU HAVE.

23:26.038 --> 23:28.875
I'M THE EXPERT HERE.

23:28.908 --> 23:30.877
OH. OH.

23:30.910 --> 23:32.579
YOU'RE THE EXPERT,
ARE YOU?

23:32.612 --> 23:35.147
ALL RIGHT. HOW MUCH, UH,
IF I THROW IN THIS RING?

23:36.516 --> 23:38.751
UH, I'D GIVE YOU
50 EXTRA BUCKS.

23:39.652 --> 23:40.787
$60.

23:40.820 --> 23:43.490
WAIT  LOWER?
W

23:43.523 --> 23:46.959
THIS RING --
THIS RING IS WORTH $500!

23:46.993 --> 23:48.661
I-I DON'T TRUST YOU.

23:48.695 --> 23:50.930
I DON'T TRUST YOU TO --
TO LOOK THROUGH ALL OF OUR LOOT.

23:50.963 --> 23:52.532
NO,
YOU'RE A CON ARTIST,

23:52.565 --> 23:54.934
SCAMMING PEOPLE
TO MAIL THEIR GOLD IN

23:54.967 --> 23:57.704
SO YOU CAN ROB THEM
OF THEIR POSSESSIONS!

23:57.737 --> 23:59.572
I RESENT THAT!

23:59.606 --> 24:03.643
WHEN A CUSTOMER DECIDES TO SEND
A NECKLACE OR A RING TO ME,

24:03.676 --> 24:05.645
THAT ITEM
CLEARLY DOESN'T HAVE

24:05.678 --> 24:08.014
MUCH PERSONAL VALUE TO THEM
ANYMORE.

24:09.916 --> 24:11.618
I STILL
DON'T TRUST THE GUY.

24:11.651 --> 24:13.986
OH, MY GOD.

24:14.020 --> 24:17.156
I DON'T HAVE TIME FOR A LONG,
DRAWN-OUT NEGOTIATION

24:17.189 --> 24:19.626
W-WITH -- W-WITH
A PAIR OF ROBBERS!

24:20.827 --> 24:22.929
I NEED THE COINS.

24:22.962 --> 24:27.834
THAT'S WHAT I WANT --
THE DOUBLE EAGLE COINS.

24:27.867 --> 24:30.236
DOUBLE EAGLES.
DOUBLE EAGLES.

24:32.104 --> 24:36.142
HE'S TALKING ABOUT SOME
RARE COINS THAT ARE WORTH...

24:36.175 --> 24:39.612
WOW.

24:40.880 --> 24:43.950
PLEASE. PLEASE.

24:43.983 --> 24:46.218
WE CAN SPLIT THE MONEY.

24:46.252 --> 24:47.587
OH, MY GOD.

24:48.955 --> 24:51.658
MILO SOLD THE COINS

24:51.691 --> 24:53.793
TO THE GUY
ON THE OTHER END OF THIS CALL.

24:53.826 --> 24:56.796
HE'S A HORRIBLE
HUMAN BEING.

24:56.829 --> 24:58.931
EATS FLIES.
KILLS PUPPIES.

25:00.299 --> 25:01.768
YOU'D PROBABLY LOVE HIM.

25:01.801 --> 25:03.269
HELP ME, SOMEBODY.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.006
HELLO?

25:08.240 --> 25:09.809
OHH, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

25:09.842 --> 25:12.044
EVERYTHING --
EVERYTHING'S COOL.

25:12.078 --> 25:13.646
MILO?

25:13.680 --> 25:16.182
YOU WANT TO TALK TO --
TO MILO?

25:16.215 --> 25:18.685
M-MILO'S, UH...

25:18.718 --> 25:21.020
BUSY. WHY?

25:22.354 --> 25:23.856
WHAT?

25:23.890 --> 25:25.725
NO, NO, NO.
LOOK, LOOK, LOOK.

25:25.758 --> 25:29.295
I WILL SORT THIS OUT,
AND I WILL CALL YOU BACK.

25:30.329 --> 25:35.802
THE BUYER SAYS THAT HE'S ALREADY
TALKED WITH SOMEONE ELSE

25:35.835 --> 25:38.270
WHO SAYS
THEY HAVE THE COINS.

25:38.304 --> 25:39.972
BE READY TO MOVE.

25:41.307 --> 25:47.914
YOU ALREADY GAVE THE COINS
TO SOMEONE ELSE.

25:47.947 --> 25:50.049
THIS...

25:50.082 --> 25:54.887
THIS IS SOME KIND OF TRAP.

25:57.256 --> 25:59.826
FRANK! HEEL! HEEL!

25:59.859 --> 26:01.160
THE DOG!
FRANK!

26:01.193 --> 26:02.161
THE EVIDENCE!
FRANK!

26:02.194 --> 26:03.329
YOU MEAN ME!
STOP!

26:04.196 --> 26:05.732
FRANK!
FRANK!

26:05.765 --> 26:07.299
FRANK!
HERE, BOY!
COME ON!

26:07.333 --> 26:08.367
FRANK!

26:08.400 --> 26:10.703
OH, GOD.
OH, GOD.

26:10.737 --> 26:12.839
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

26:12.872 --> 26:15.975
ARE -- ARE YOU A GOOD GUY
OR A BAD GUY?

26:16.008 --> 26:17.910
JERRY COOPER,
YOU'RE UNDER ARREST.

26:17.944 --> 26:19.278
FOR WHAT?!

26:19.311 --> 26:22.348
OH,
FOR ABOUT 48 HOURS.

26:22.381 --> 26:25.818
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.
DO YOU HAVE THE COINS OR NOT?

26:25.852 --> 26:28.020
WHAT'D YOU CALL
THOSE COINS AGAIN?

26:28.054 --> 26:29.789
THE DOUBLE EAGLES.

26:29.822 --> 26:34.193
A $20 GOLD COIN MINTED IN 1933
BUT NEVER MONETIZED.

26:34.226 --> 26:36.896
THE COINS WERE
SUPPOSED TO BE DESTROYED.

26:36.929 --> 26:38.998
SO, HOW DO THESE EXIST,
SIR?

26:39.031 --> 26:40.700
A SMALL BUT UNKNOWN NUMBER
WERE STOLEN BEFORE THE MELT,

26:40.733 --> 26:44.637
WHICH MEANS
ANY 1933 DOUBLE EAGLE OUT THERE,

26:44.671 --> 26:47.273
REGARDLESS
OF HOW IT WAS ACQUIRED,

26:47.306 --> 26:49.041
IS PROPERTY STOLEN
FROM THE U.S. GOVERNMENT,

26:49.075 --> 26:52.244
WHICH, ODDLY ENOUGH, IS
WHY THEY ARE VALUED SO HIGHLY.

26:52.278 --> 26:53.980
YEAH,
AT $8 MILLION APIECE.

26:54.013 --> 26:55.715
JERRY SAID
HE HAD TWO OF THEM.

26:55.748 --> 26:58.284
WHICH IS WHY I'M ABOUT TO
WAKE UP SOME OF MY PEOPLE.

26:58.317 --> 27:01.688
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME
A MINUTE, CHIEF.

27:01.721 --> 27:04.924
SO THE $500,000
IN THE GOLDIBUCKS' ACCOUNT...

27:04.957 --> 27:07.159
...MUST HAVE BEEN
A DOWN PAYMENT.

27:07.193 --> 27:09.128
CHIEF, JERRY'S BUYER
KEEPS CALLING.

27:09.161 --> 27:10.663
BUT HIS NUMBER'S BLOCKED,

27:10.697 --> 27:12.198
AND I'VE BEEN PINGING
INDIVIDUAL CELL TOWERS --

27:12.231 --> 27:15.134
CHIEF, IT SMELLS LIKE THE
EVIDENCE MIGHT BE ON THE WAY.

27:16.168 --> 27:17.203
OHH.

27:17.236 --> 27:19.939
LIZ...

27:19.972 --> 27:22.441
WHY DON'T YOU AND I
TAKE FRANK FOR ANOTHER WALK?

27:22.474 --> 27:24.376
THAT'S NOT A BAD IDEA.

27:24.410 --> 27:27.146
HE'S GETTING THAT EXPRESSION
ON HIS FACE.

27:27.179 --> 27:28.981
THANK YOU SO MUCH.

27:29.949 --> 27:31.417
HOW CAN I HELP,
CHIEF?

27:31.450 --> 27:33.285
YOU CAN CARRY THE EVIDENCE BAG
FOR CAPTAIN RAYDOR.

27:33.319 --> 27:35.287
OH, OKAY.

27:35.321 --> 27:37.056
IF WE CAN'T
TRACE THE CALL,

27:37.089 --> 27:38.791
WE'LL HAVE TO HAVE JERRY
PICK IT UP.

27:38.825 --> 27:40.927
LIEUTENANT.

27:41.961 --> 27:43.730
LIEUTENANT!

27:44.396 --> 27:46.098
OH. YEAH, YEAH, RIGHT.
YEAH.

27:54.206 --> 27:56.208
HELLO, JERRY.

27:56.242 --> 27:58.477
YOU GUYS ENTRAPPED ME.
SORRY ABOUT THAT,

27:58.510 --> 28:01.080
BUT WE NEEDED TO FIND OUT
WHAT WAS IN THE SAFE.

28:01.113 --> 28:03.415
SO WHY DON'T YOU TELL ME
HOW YOU ENDED UP WITH

28:03.449 --> 28:05.985
TWO STOLEN
1933 DOUBLE EAGLE COINS?

28:06.018 --> 28:07.219
I DID NOT STEAL THEM.

28:07.253 --> 28:09.789
SOME WOMAN MAILED THEM
INTO GOLDIBUCKS.

28:09.822 --> 28:12.124
AND I'M SURE
YOU GAVE HER A FAIR PRICE.

28:12.158 --> 28:14.927
MILO PAID HER,
AND SHE CASHED HER CHECK,

28:14.961 --> 28:17.363
EVEN SENT US
A THANK

28:17.396 --> 28:18.965
SO NOT STOLEN.

28:18.998 --> 28:21.100
NOW THAT WE'VE GOT THAT
SORTED OUT, CAN I GO?

28:21.133 --> 28:22.468
UNFORTUNATELY, JERRY,

28:22.501 --> 28:25.471
IT'S ILLEGAL TO EVEN POSSESS
THE DOUBLE EAGLES.

28:25.504 --> 28:26.906
DAMN IT!

28:26.939 --> 28:30.509
MILO SAID
NO ONE WOULD CARE.

28:30.542 --> 28:33.512
BUT YOU DO.
PEOPLE CARE.

28:35.414 --> 28:37.483
WE ALSO KNOW THAT YOU WERE
PLANNING ON SELLING THOSE COINS

28:37.516 --> 28:39.886
TO THE PERSON ON THE OTHER END
OF THIS BLOCKED CALL.

28:39.919 --> 28:41.754
NOT ME! MILO!

28:41.788 --> 28:43.455
MILO WAS
PLANNING TO SELL THEM,

28:43.489 --> 28:47.059
AND, OKAY, HE WAS GOING TO PAY
ME FOR RECOGNIZING THEIR VALUE,

28:47.093 --> 28:49.261
BUT IT WAS ALL HIM.

28:49.295 --> 28:52.031
AND NOW HE'S DEAD.

28:52.064 --> 28:55.034
I TOLD HIM,
"CUT BACK ON THE BACON.

28:55.067 --> 28:59.338
WHY NOT TRY MARGARINE ON YOUR
STEAK INSTEAD OF BUTTER?"

28:59.371 --> 29:02.208
THE PEOPLE WHO GAVE MILO
THAT HEART ATTACK

29:02.241 --> 29:03.542
AND ROBBED YOUR STORE

29:03.575 --> 29:06.145
ARE ABOUT TO SELL THE COINS
THEMSELVES.

29:06.178 --> 29:08.514
NOW, WE HAVE FROZEN
YOUR ACCOUNTS, JERRY BOY.

29:08.547 --> 29:10.783
SO WHAT DO YOU THINK'S
GOING TO HAPPEN

29:10.817 --> 29:13.319
WHEN MILO'S BUYER FINDS OUT
THAT YOU CAN'T REPAY

29:13.352 --> 29:15.922
THE $500,000
THAT HE ADVANCED YOU?

29:15.955 --> 29:17.389
YOU'RE IN DANGER NOW,
JERRY,

29:17.423 --> 29:19.091
SO YOU'D BETTER ANSWER THAT
PHONE THE NEXT TIME IT RINGS

29:19.125 --> 29:23.395
AND ASK MILO'S BUYER
IF HE'S MET WITH THE ROBBERS.

29:25.832 --> 29:27.266
OR DON'T PICK UP,
AND I'LL ANSWER IT

29:27.299 --> 29:28.935
AND TELL HIM YOU'RE COOPERATING
WITH THE POLICE.

29:28.968 --> 29:30.569
JUST -- JUST...

29:33.539 --> 29:36.175
I'M DEAD, DEAD.

29:38.845 --> 29:39.946
Speak.

29:40.913 --> 29:44.116
HEY, VIKTOR.
WHAT'S UP?

29:44.150 --> 29:46.285
MARKOV:
"What's up," Jerry"

29:46.318 --> 29:49.155
MILO TELLS ME
YOU GUYS HAVE THE COINS.

29:49.188 --> 29:53.592
YOU SHOW ME THE COINS,
YOU TAKE MY $500,000,

29:53.625 --> 29:56.829
AND NOW MILO IS NOT
ANSWERING HIS PHONE.

29:56.863 --> 29:59.999
AND ANOTHER THIEF I DEAL WITH
IS CALLING ME,

30:00.032 --> 30:01.367
saying that he and his
lady friend have the coins.

30:01.400 --> 30:03.836
So let me ask you,

30:03.870 --> 30:06.973
JERRY THE IDIOT,
WHAT'S UP?

30:07.006 --> 30:10.142
UM...
TELL ME, VIKTOR,

30:10.176 --> 30:15.481
THESE OTHER GUYS,
DID THEY SHOW YOU THE EAGLES?

30:15.514 --> 30:19.551
I'm meeting with them tomorrow
at 9:00 A.M. at my gallery.

30:19.585 --> 30:21.587
HOW ABOUT
YOU MEET WITH US, TOO?

30:21.620 --> 30:23.289
Either they have the coins
or you do,

30:23.322 --> 30:27.193
AND IF YOU DON'T,
THEN BRING ME MY MONEY.

30:27.226 --> 30:30.329
ANYTHING ELSE,
AND I'LL KILL YOU.

30:30.362 --> 30:32.264
SOUND GOOD?

30:32.298 --> 30:35.935
TOMORROW AT 9:00.
CAN I JUST CHECK MY CALENDAR?

30:35.968 --> 30:37.970
TELL HIM
YOU'LL BE THERE.

30:38.004 --> 30:39.238
NO! I DON'T HAVE
THE COINS OR THE MONEY.

30:39.271 --> 30:41.007
THAT MEANS HE'LL KILL ME.

30:41.040 --> 30:44.276
YOU WON'T BE THERE ALONE.
YOU'LL BE PERFECTLY SAFE.

30:44.310 --> 30:48.014
JERRY?
JERRY, YOU THERE?

30:52.251 --> 30:54.586
Sorry. Reception.

30:54.620 --> 30:56.923
UH, ANYWAY, TURNS OUT...

30:58.124 --> 31:01.093
...I'M COMPLETELY FREE.

31:01.127 --> 31:02.995
I'LL BE THERE.

31:06.432 --> 31:09.401
OH, HEY, CHIEF.

31:09.435 --> 31:10.569
GUESS WHAT.

31:10.602 --> 31:13.005
FRANK DROPPED THE KIDS OFF
AT THE POOL.

31:13.039 --> 31:14.273
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

31:14.306 --> 31:15.641
NO SIGN OF CLYDE YET,

31:15.674 --> 31:18.577
BUT WE'RE SO CLOSE TO BONNIE,
WE CAN SMELL IT.

31:18.610 --> 31:20.947
WE'VE GOT THE GLOVE.

31:20.980 --> 31:23.049
EWW.

31:23.082 --> 31:26.052
UM, I'LL START
WORKING ON A PRINT.

31:26.085 --> 31:28.955
I'VE GOT THIS FEELING THAT
SHE'S ALREADY IN THE SYSTEM.

31:28.988 --> 31:31.190
OH, THANK YOU SO MUCH,
SHARON.

31:31.223 --> 31:32.524
NO PROBLEM, CHIEF.

31:32.558 --> 31:34.526
LIEUTENANT TAO,
DETECTIVE SANCHEZ,

31:34.560 --> 31:36.062
I'M INCREDIBLY SORRY
TO ASK YOU THIS,

31:36.095 --> 31:38.497
BUT DO YOU MIND HELPING
CAPTAIN RAYDOR?

31:38.530 --> 31:40.566
SURE.

31:42.301 --> 31:44.070
GOOD DOG, FRANK.

31:44.103 --> 31:48.474
THAT MAY BE THE LAST WONDERFUL,
LOVING THING HE EVER DOES.

31:48.507 --> 31:51.978
ALL MY HOPES FOR HIM
WERE BOUND UP WITH THAT RING.

31:52.011 --> 31:53.579
NOW WHAT DO WE DO?

31:53.612 --> 31:57.984
LOOK, UM, AFTER WE CLEAR THINGS
UP WITH JERRY TOMORROW,

31:58.017 --> 32:01.988
I'LL GET YOU
WHAT THAT RING IS REALLY WORTH.

32:02.021 --> 32:03.055
I PROMISE.

32:11.097 --> 32:12.598
I DON'T THINK
I CAN DO THIS.

32:12.631 --> 32:14.233
YOU'RE PERFECTLY SAFE.

32:14.266 --> 32:16.268
AS SOON AS THE PEOPLE
WHO ROBBED YOUR STORE

32:16.302 --> 32:18.370
SHOW UP WITH THE DOUBLE EAGLES,
WE'LL ARREST EVERYONE.

32:18.404 --> 32:20.006
AND I'LL BE WITH YOU
THE WHOLE TIME.

32:20.039 --> 32:21.473
VIKTOR MARKOV
IS NEVER GONNA BELIEVE

32:21.507 --> 32:23.075
THAT I WOULD DATE
SOMEONE LIKE YOU.

32:23.109 --> 32:24.643
WHY NOT?

32:24.676 --> 32:26.645
HE'S A MUCH BETTER APPRAISER
THAN I AM.

32:26.678 --> 32:28.247
AND HE'S NEVER
GONNA BELIEVE

32:28.280 --> 32:30.449
THAT ONE OF ME
IS WORTH ANY OF YOU.

32:30.482 --> 32:33.052
YOU UNDERESTIMATE
YOURSELF.

32:33.085 --> 32:35.454
RIGHT NOW I CAN'T THINK
OF ANYONE ELSE ON EARTH

32:35.487 --> 32:38.457
I'D RATHER BE WITH
THAN YOU.

32:38.490 --> 32:42.194
NOW...GO ON.

33:00.346 --> 33:03.649
JERRY.
AND NO MILO.

33:03.682 --> 33:06.352
MILO DOESN'T CLOSE DEALS.
I DO.

33:06.385 --> 33:08.387
I SEE YOU'VE BEEN SPENDING
YOUR MONEY, HUH?

33:08.420 --> 33:09.688
AND YOUR NAME,
DEAR?

33:09.721 --> 33:11.490
IT'S BRENDA.

33:11.523 --> 33:15.594
WHAT A LOVELY GALLERY YOU HAVE.
THE PIECES ARE AMAZIN'.

33:15.627 --> 33:17.763
SO YOU BROUGHT A DATE.

33:17.796 --> 33:19.465
BUT DID YOU BRING
THE DOUBLE EAGLES?

33:19.498 --> 33:21.700
YEP,
I BROUGHT THEM.

33:21.733 --> 33:23.135
MAY I SEE THEM?

33:23.169 --> 33:25.137
WELL, WE NEED TO DISCUSS
A PRICE FIRST.

33:25.171 --> 33:28.340
THE PRICE HAS BEEN SET
AT $8 MILLION.

33:28.374 --> 33:31.743
THIS WAS AGREED UPON
AND IS NON-NEGOTIABLE.

33:31.777 --> 33:36.482
ANY OTHER PREVIOUSLY DISCUSSED
ISSUES YOU'D LIKE TO RAISE?

33:38.217 --> 33:40.719
OH, HOW WONDERFUL
TO SEE YOU AGAIN.

33:40.752 --> 33:44.490
JERRY SAYS
HE HAS THE COINS.

33:45.857 --> 33:47.526
I DON'T KNOW WHAT SCAM
HE'S TRYING TO PULL,

33:47.559 --> 33:48.760
BUT THEY'RE RIGHT HERE.

33:48.794 --> 33:51.630
Those are them,
the double eagles.

33:51.663 --> 33:53.099
THANK YOU, JERRY.

33:53.132 --> 33:54.800
SO LET ME PROPERLY
INTRODUCE MYSELF.

33:54.833 --> 33:57.336
I'M DEPUTY CHIEF
BRENDA LEIGH JOHNSON, L.A.P.D.,

33:57.369 --> 33:59.105
AND Y'ALL
ARE UNDER ARREST!

33:59.138 --> 34:00.772
DON'T MOVE!
DOWN ON THE GROUND!

34:00.806 --> 34:03.542
DOWN ON THE GROUND!
DO IT NOW!

34:03.575 --> 34:06.645
NOT YOU, JERRY.
YOU'RE GONNA MEET MY HUSBAND.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.614
YOUR HUSBAND?
YES.

34:08.647 --> 34:11.650
CHIEF, GOT CLYDE,
BUT THERE'S NO SIGN OF BONNIE.

34:11.683 --> 34:14.320
LET'S READ HIM HIS RIGHTS
AND SEE IF HE'LL TALK TO US.

34:14.353 --> 34:16.588
Gabriel:
CHIEF, MEET PAUL WOODS.

34:16.622 --> 34:19.291
HE WAS A CHEMISTRY TEACHER
AT WEST CALVIN HIGH SCHOOL

34:19.325 --> 34:21.227
BEFORE BEING LAID OFF
THREE YEARS AGO.

34:21.260 --> 34:23.762
BEEN UNEMPLOYED
EVER SINCE.

34:23.795 --> 34:25.631
THAT'S A BIG HOLE
IN YOUR RéSUMé, SIR.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.134
LET'S TALK ABOUT WHERE
ALL THAT TIME HAS GONE.

34:28.167 --> 34:31.637
SURE. BUT LET'S DO IT
WITH A LAWYER, OVER LUNCH.

34:31.670 --> 34:35.107
SERIOUSLY, I'M HYPOGLYCEMIC,
AND I NEED TO EAT SOON.

34:36.275 --> 34:38.510
OKAY.

34:38.544 --> 34:40.846
Pope: HE HAD THE DOUBLE EAGLE
COINS ON HIM?

34:40.879 --> 34:43.382
THAT'S FIVE YEARS
RIGHT THERE.

34:43.415 --> 34:45.517
PLUS WHAT HE'LL GET
FOR IMPERSONATING AN OFFICER.

34:45.551 --> 34:46.785
Brenda:
MILO DIED OF A HEART ATTACK

34:46.818 --> 34:49.255
BECAUSE CLYDE
WAS ROBBING HIS STORE.

34:49.288 --> 34:50.322
I WANT HIM FOR MURDER.

34:51.490 --> 34:53.592
WE GOT HER.
WE GOT BONNIE.

34:53.625 --> 34:55.894
HER NAME'S AUDREY RANGLE, AND
THEY'RE BRINGING HER RIGHT OUT.

34:55.927 --> 34:57.763
THE PRINT CAME OUT?

34:57.796 --> 34:59.165
WE HAD TO MATCH IT UP
WITH SOME PARTIALS

34:59.198 --> 35:00.432
WE FOUND
AT THE CRIME SCENE.

35:00.466 --> 35:02.634
A TYPICAL FINGERPRINT
HAS 10 POINTS,

35:02.668 --> 35:05.471
BUT -- NOW, THIS
IS VERY INTERESTING.
IT WORKED.

35:05.504 --> 35:08.207
ALL RIGHT, UH,
LIEUTENANTS, LIZ,

35:08.240 --> 35:10.576
IS THIS THE WOMAN
FROM GOLDIBUCKS?

35:10.609 --> 35:13.345
UH, I THOUGHT
SHE HAD MORE OF A GLOW.

35:13.379 --> 35:15.247
Flynn: I NEED TO SEE
ONE WITH HER HANDS.

35:15.281 --> 35:17.316
OH, FOR GOD'S SAKE.

35:17.349 --> 35:18.617
OH, YEAH.
THAT'S HER.

35:18.650 --> 35:19.918
YEAH, NO DOUBT
IN MY MIND, CHIEF.

35:19.951 --> 35:21.853
IT'S DEFINITELY
THE SAME YOUNG WOMAN.

35:21.887 --> 35:23.389
THANK YOU.
IS SHE A COP?

35:23.422 --> 35:24.690
SHE WAS A LAWYER,

35:24.723 --> 35:27.326
WHICH IS WHY SHE HAD
AN M-NUMBER PRINT ON FILE

35:27.359 --> 35:28.627
AND WHY SHE WAS ALSO
ABLE TO WRITE UP

35:28.660 --> 35:29.928
SUCH A REALISTIC WARRANT.

35:29.961 --> 35:33.165
SHE LOST HER JOB
IN REAL ESTATE IN 2008.

35:33.199 --> 35:35.534
SHE'S ASKED FOR AN ATTORNEY.
GREAT. SO NEITHER ONE
OF THEM'S TALKING.

35:35.567 --> 35:37.736
YEAH, BUT THEY
DON'T KNOW THAT.

35:37.769 --> 35:39.505
DETECTIVE GABRIEL.

35:40.672 --> 35:44.310
LIEUTENANT FLYNN,
PAUL SAID HE WAS VERY HUNGRY.

35:44.343 --> 35:46.312
OH, WOULD YOU LIKE US TO TAKE
HIS LUNCH ORDER?

35:46.345 --> 35:47.813
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

35:47.846 --> 35:49.948
KEEP HIM BUSY
FOR FIVE MINUTES.

35:49.981 --> 35:52.451
IT'LL TAKE AT LEAST
THAT LONG TO GO THROUGH
OUR LIST OF SPECIALS.

35:52.484 --> 35:53.552
THANK YOU.

35:53.585 --> 35:55.321
LIZ, UH,
YOU NEED TO COME OUT.

35:55.354 --> 35:57.356
YOU DON'T WANT FRANK
TO SEE THIS.

35:59.925 --> 36:02.361
OKAY, SO, I'M OBVIOUSLY
MISSING SOMETHING HERE.

36:02.394 --> 36:05.264
HOW IS TAKING A LUNCH ORDER
GOING TO GET HER TO TALK TO US?

36:05.297 --> 36:06.465
QUIET.
YOU'LL SPOIL EVERYTHING.

36:07.433 --> 36:10.302
Brenda:
HELLO, THERE.

36:10.336 --> 36:11.537
I KNOW YOU'VE ASKED FOR
A LAWYER,

36:11.570 --> 36:13.305
WHICH WAS VERY SMART,
BY THE WAY,

36:13.339 --> 36:15.707
SO I CAN'T QUESTION YOU,
BUT, UM, WHILE WE'RE WAITING,

36:15.741 --> 36:17.443
I'D LOVE FOR YOU
TO HAVE A SEAT

36:17.476 --> 36:19.478
SO I CAN SHOW YOU SOMETHING,
MRS. WOODS.

36:19.511 --> 36:22.581
OH, I'M SORRY. IT'S MISS RANGLE,
NOT MRS. WOODS.

36:22.614 --> 36:25.417
OH, I'M SO SORRY. I JUST ASSUMED
THAT YOU TWO WERE MARRIED.

36:25.451 --> 36:26.785
THAT WILL
MAKE THIS EASIER.

36:31.290 --> 36:33.492
Provenza: WRITE ALL THIS DOWN.
I'M NOT REPEATING IT.

36:33.525 --> 36:35.461
YOU GUYS REALLY HAVE A CHEF
IN THE BUILDING?

36:35.494 --> 36:37.529
WHAT DO YOU THINK,
WE ORDER TAKEOUT?

36:37.563 --> 36:38.630
WE'RE THE POLICE.

36:38.664 --> 36:40.332
HE CAN HANDLE
DETAILED ORDERS?

36:40.366 --> 36:42.368
I GOT MAJOR
GLUTEN ALLERGIES.

36:42.401 --> 36:43.535
OH.

36:43.569 --> 36:45.003
YEAH, WELL,
YOU JUST MAKE SURE

36:45.036 --> 36:48.440
EVERYTHING ON OUR MENU LIST
ENDS UP ON THIS NOTEPAD.

36:48.474 --> 36:50.376
Raydor: PAUL IS TALKING
TO US, AUDREY,

36:50.409 --> 36:52.878
AND BECAUSE YOU'RE NOT MARRIED,
HE CAN TESTIFY AGAINST YOU.

36:54.413 --> 36:57.549
HE WOULDN'T DO THAT.

36:57.583 --> 36:58.850
NOW, I THINK WE'LL START

36:58.884 --> 37:01.253
WITH A LIST OF OUR
WHEAT-FREE ALTERNATIVES.

37:01.287 --> 37:02.888
GO FOR IT.

37:04.623 --> 37:08.327
FIRST,
WE HAVE A QUINOA PASTA.

37:08.360 --> 37:09.528
MMM.

37:09.561 --> 37:10.929
NOW, THAT CAN GO
WITH SEVERAL SAUCES.

37:10.962 --> 37:12.631
Brenda: I CAN'T ASK YOU THIS,
SO ASK YOURSELF,

37:12.664 --> 37:14.466
HOW WERE WE
ABLE TO FIND YOU

37:14.500 --> 37:16.335
SO QUICKLY
AFTER ARRESTING MR. WOODS?

37:19.971 --> 37:23.942
AND WE HAVE
VEGETARIAN LASAGNA...

37:23.975 --> 37:26.978
A VERY NICE
CHICKEN PARMESAN.

37:27.012 --> 37:29.315
YOU HAVE
VEGETARIAN LASAGNA

37:29.348 --> 37:31.317
AND CHICKEN PARMESAN
THAT IS GLUTEN

37:31.350 --> 37:34.886
HE'S SAYING THE MURDER
WAS ALL YOUR FAULT.

37:34.920 --> 37:36.021
MURDER?

37:36.054 --> 37:37.523
DON'T SAY ANYTHING.

37:37.556 --> 37:38.724
WE'RE NOT LETTING YOU
GET AWAY WITH A HOMICIDE

37:38.757 --> 37:40.792
BECAUSE WE BROKE
THE MIRANDA WARNING.

37:40.826 --> 37:42.561
Gabriel: YEAH,
WE LIKE TO GET CONVICTIONS

37:42.594 --> 37:45.464
FOR PEOPLE WHO SAVAGELY BEAT
ELDERLY STORE OWNERS TO DEATH.

37:45.497 --> 37:47.666
OKAY, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT, WAIT.
WE -- WE DID NOT BEAT ANYONE.

37:47.699 --> 37:50.602
STOP TALKING, AUDREY,
YOU'VE ASKED FOR A LAWYER.

37:50.636 --> 37:52.604
WELL, THEN I REVOKE
UNTIL HE GETS HERE

37:52.638 --> 37:55.073
BECAUSE WE DID NOT
BEAT THAT MAN UP.

37:55.106 --> 37:57.776
OKAY, YES, WE CAME IN
AND WE FLASHED OUR BADGES.

37:57.809 --> 37:59.311
YES, OKAY.
WE DID THAT.

37:59.345 --> 38:01.780
BUT THAT OLD GUY,
HE JUST KEELED OVER.

38:01.813 --> 38:04.350
OKAY, WE -- WE DIDN'T BEAT HIM.
WE TRIED TO GIVE HIM CPR.

38:04.383 --> 38:06.284
HE JUST DIED.

38:07.553 --> 38:09.855
THERE -- THERE WAS NO MURDER.
IT WAS A HEART ATTACK.

38:09.888 --> 38:11.557
Pope: A HEART ATTACK
THAT HAPPENED

38:11.590 --> 38:13.325
DURING THE COMMISSION
OF A FELONY.

38:13.359 --> 38:14.660
AS AN ATTORNEY,
YOU'RE FAMILIAR WITH

38:14.693 --> 38:17.028
THE FELONY MURDER RULE,
YES?

38:17.062 --> 38:20.932
UH...
WHAT IS THAT, AGAIN?

38:22.468 --> 38:23.869
HELLO, AGAIN.

38:23.902 --> 38:28.740
YOU -- WE COULD HAVE HAD
SOMETHING SPECIAL, AND NOW...

38:30.642 --> 38:32.611
SO, IS THAT
HIS CONFESSION?

38:32.644 --> 38:34.713
NO.
HE WOULDN'T TALK.

38:34.746 --> 38:35.947
THIS IS
WHAT'S FOR LUNCH.

38:38.584 --> 38:40.986
Brenda: I CAN'T BELIEVE
I HAD TO BEG POPE

38:41.019 --> 38:42.588
TO INVESTIGATE THIS MURDER
WITH YOU.

38:42.621 --> 38:45.357
IT'S HARD BEING CLOSE
TO PEOPLE YOU WORK WITH.

38:45.391 --> 38:46.792
IT'S ALWAYS HARD.

38:46.825 --> 38:50.362
YOU GOT TO BE PATIENT WITH
PEOPLE WHO DRIVE YOU CRAZY.

38:50.396 --> 38:55.667
I FIND THAT GOOD RELATIONSHIPS
SOMETIMES DEPEND...

38:55.701 --> 38:58.804
ON WHAT YOU'RE
WILLING TO OVERLOOK.

39:05.577 --> 39:06.812
CHIEF?

39:06.845 --> 39:08.614
THIS IS THE LAST
OF THE FORGED ART

39:08.647 --> 39:10.816
WE FOUND
AT THE MARKOV GALLERY.

39:10.849 --> 39:12.017
OKAY, GOOD.

39:12.050 --> 39:13.619
UM, LET'S JUST
MOVE IT OUT OF THE WAY

39:13.652 --> 39:15.754
SO THAT FRANK
CAN'T GET TO IT, PLEASE.

39:15.787 --> 39:16.855
AND, UH, THESE, CHIEF?

39:16.888 --> 39:19.591
THE FBI
WILL TAKE THOSE.

39:19.625 --> 39:22.494
WHAT'D YOU DO
WITH JERRY COOPER?

39:22.528 --> 39:27.699
I BELIEVE YOU MEAN
JOHN Q. SMITH.

39:27.733 --> 39:29.601
I'VE NEVER MET ANYONE
SO EXCITED

39:29.635 --> 39:31.069
TO JOIN THE
WITNESS PROTECTION PROGRAM.

39:31.102 --> 39:32.871
CAN I SEE
THE GOLD COINS?

39:32.904 --> 39:34.606
OH, I'M SORRY, MISS.

39:34.640 --> 39:36.475
THAT'S GOVERNMENT
PROPERTY.

39:36.508 --> 39:40.646
SO NOW ALL GOVERNMENT PROPERTY
IS SUDDENLY OFF

39:40.679 --> 39:43.782
WELL, NOT ALL.

39:46.685 --> 39:51.490
LIZ, THE DEPARTMENT OWES YOU
A THANK-YOU FOR ALL YOU'VE DONE.

39:53.058 --> 39:55.927
YOU'RE WELCOME, ANDY.

39:55.961 --> 39:58.029
OH, AND IF YOU EVER
WANT TO JUST VENT,

39:58.063 --> 40:01.032
WE ALL GET TOGETHER
EVERY COUPLE OF MONTHS.

40:01.066 --> 40:03.001
WHO'S WE?
LOUIE'S OTHER WIVES.

40:03.034 --> 40:06.037
WE THINK OF YOU
AS THE FIFTH.

40:08.774 --> 40:11.042
I SHOULD LEAVE
IF I'M GONNA MAKE

40:11.076 --> 40:12.744
THIS VET APPOINTMENT
FOR FRANK.

40:15.581 --> 40:18.116
WERE YOU ABLE TO FIND
THE RIGHT AMOUNT OF
MONEY FOR THE RING?

40:18.149 --> 40:19.851
I'M BUYING IT FROM YOU,

40:19.885 --> 40:22.588
SINCE I'M THE ONLY ONE
THAT IT MEANT ANYTHING TO.

40:22.621 --> 40:24.590
OH, STOP!

40:24.623 --> 40:27.859
IT MEANS SOMETHING TO ME.

40:27.893 --> 40:29.861
IT REMINDS ME
OF THAT VERY SPECIAL DAY

40:29.895 --> 40:33.565
WHEN WE OFFICIALLY WENT FROM
TWO PEOPLE WHO LOVED EACH OTHER

40:33.599 --> 40:36.034
TO HUSBAND AND WIFE.

40:36.067 --> 40:39.037
AND WHEN I LOOK AT IT,
I-I ALSO SEE

40:39.070 --> 40:43.909
OUR CHILDREN
AND OUR GRANDKIDS

40:43.942 --> 40:46.478
AND THE LIFE
WE MIGHT HAVE HAD.

40:47.879 --> 40:50.749
BUT...YOU'LL STILL
TAKE THE CHECK.

40:50.782 --> 40:52.217
YES.

40:53.885 --> 40:55.220
OH!

40:55.253 --> 40:58.123
I...I THINK
THAT'LL TAKE CARE OF

40:58.156 --> 41:00.258
FRANK'S MEDICAL BILLS
FOR A WHILE.

41:00.291 --> 41:02.694
OH -- AND, UH, HERE.

41:05.230 --> 41:07.198
I OWN IT NOW.

41:07.232 --> 41:08.700
SO...

41:12.270 --> 41:13.605
...KEEP IT SAFE.

41:17.108 --> 41:18.209
OH, LOUIE.

41:22.714 --> 41:25.684
YOU KNOW,
AFTER WE GET FRANK HOME,

41:25.717 --> 41:28.654
I COULD DRIVE YOU TO McCLURE'S,
AND IF YOU BUY ME DINNER,

41:28.687 --> 41:31.790
I'LL EVEN SIT AT THE BAR AND
WATCH YOU DRINK FOR A FEW HOURS.

41:31.823 --> 41:34.960
WELL,
IF YOU NEED THE COMPANY.
