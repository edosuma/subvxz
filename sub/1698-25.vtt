Good food, good people,

the fresh aroma of manure
in the morning. [inhales]

00:14.500 --> 00:19.667

I can still smell it.
- That would be my shoe, Daddy.

00:19.667 --> 00:23.300
Normally, I'd hate it,
but that guy at security
did wave me through quickly.

00:24.500 --> 00:25.800
Bye-bye.

00:27.867 --> 00:30.300

Hi, birthday girl, what's up?

00:36.900 --> 00:40.033
Well, I'm down here at the beach
where Oliver planned a picnic,

00:40.033 --> 00:42.934
and then a romantic
sunset walk by the water,

00:42.934 --> 00:45.767
and then any chick flick I want,
even one where Orlando Bloom

00:45.767 --> 00:49.300
falls in love with the mermaid
and then sells his soul
for gills and a flipper.

00:49.300 --> 00:55.000
- Sounds like the perfect day.
- I know! And it would be...
if he wasn't sick.

00:55.000 --> 00:58.400
Are you sure he's not faking it?
I mean, some guys'll do anything

00:58.400 --> 01:02.200
- to get out of
a fishy chick flick.
- No, he's definitely sick.

01:02.200 --> 01:05.600
You should of heard him
on the phone. [imitating]
"Oh, Lilly, I'm so sorry."

01:05.600 --> 01:09.133
[snorts]
He's so cute!

01:09.133 --> 01:12.033
Yeah. Because it's
your birthday,
I'm gonna let that one go.

01:12.033 --> 01:14.867
But don't worry, I'll be
home in a couple of hours.
So until then,

01:14.867 --> 01:17.100
go to my house, watch some TV
and help yourself

01:17.100 --> 01:21.000

- What? She's not family.

01:21.000 --> 01:24.400

we'll do whatever you like.

I'm feeling better already.
