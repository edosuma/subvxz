02:39.826 --> 02:40.869
RONALDO NÁZARIO

02:40.869 --> 02:42.704
...we'd go out or grab a beer,

02:43.330 --> 02:44.414
or a guaraná.

02:45.457 --> 02:48.085
And caipirinhas. David was a fan of those.

02:54.007 --> 02:56.426
When a free kick was awarded,

02:57.969 --> 03:00.597

<i>The arrival of Victoria Adams
to the capital of Spain can be interpreted</i>

12:19.155 --> 12:22.367
<i>as an attempt by the couple
to help their relationship</i>

12:22.367 --> 12:26.245
<i>that has recently deteriorated
due to the numerous stories.</i>

13:16.045 --> 13:18.506
I'm going to sneak past him.

13:25.638 --> 13:27.682
Don't do anything crazy.

14:31.079 --> 14:32.371

14:34.123 --> 14:35.291

14:35.291 --> 14:36.459

2 R. MADRID

15:54.996 --> 15:57.582
They began to doubt us.

15:57.582 --> 15:59.876
They said that we were
a marketing project,

15:59.876 --> 16:02.378
that we were not

16:02.378 --> 16:03.838

Mrs. Victoria Beckham

17:44.564 --> 17:46.482

17:46.482 --> 17:48.401
by prescheduled cesarean section.

17:53.406 --> 17:56.826
WHAT WILL POSH SAY?

18:11.966 --> 18:16.220
I am very disappointed with
the performances over the last few months.

18:17.638 --> 18:21.600
We have agreed, by mutual agreement,

18:21.600 --> 18:24.812
Carlos Queiroz
will not continue with the club.

18:26.897 --> 18:28.858
We have agreed to hire Camacho

18:28.858 --> 18:32.403
as the new coach of Real Madrid.

18:37.867 --> 18:42.246
I accept the resignation
of Antonio Camacho as coach.

18:43.289 --> 18:46.375
Remón is the new coach of Real Madrid.

19:03.392 --> 19:07.897
I have accepted the resignation
of Remón as coach of Madrid.

19:13.486 --> 19:14.320
THREE MONTHS LATER

19:14.320 --> 19:18.574
Luxemburgo is the new coach
of Real Madrid.

19:26.624 --> 19:29.168
After having analyzed the situation,

19:29.168 --> 19:31.712
I think this is the right time...

19:31.712 --> 19:32.797
FOURTEEN MONTHS LATER

19:32.797 --> 19:35.341
...for me to leave
the presidency of Real Madrid.

20:08.457 --> 20:11.502
Fabio Capello! Welcome to Madrid!

20:25.558 --> 20:30.312
<i>Fabio Capello had a message
for the heart of Madridismo.</i>

20:30.312 --> 20:32.231
FABIO CAPELLO
REAL MADRID MANAGER 2006/07

20:32.231 --> 20:35.860
The Galácticos are players
from another universe.

20:35.860 --> 20:38.654
They arrive from the stars to a club,

20:39.155 --> 20:44.702
which is great motivation
for the opponents to beat them.

20:45.911 --> 20:47.955
So I had to fix that.

20:50.082 --> 20:53.544
<i>It took Capello seconds
to show his hard hand.</i>

21:10.144 --> 21:13.355
Capello tried to have a firm hand with us.

21:16.150 --> 21:19.737
But I never agreed with
the firm-hand approach.

21:19.737 --> 21:20.988

JANUARY 2007 MADRID

27:35.445 --> 27:38.490
When David signed for Los Angeles...

27:40.534 --> 27:42.661
the Real Madrid board

27:43.287 --> 27:46.331
saw it as an offense.

27:47.207 --> 27:48.625
That had never happened.

29:15.379 --> 29:18.590
David was always on time for training

29:18.590 --> 29:20.550
and kept working very hard.

29:20.550 --> 29:23.512
It was quite a surprise for me.

29:26.515 --> 29:28.558
So we spoke to Capello...

29:30.852 --> 29:33.689
and pleaded with him
to let David train with us.

29:36.608 --> 29:38.986
I went to see the president and said...

29:40.862 --> 29:44.282
"From tomorrow, I will let David play."

29:57.105 --> 30:00.966
"If I lose, you can send me away."

38:01.029 --> 38:01.863
A little.

38:56.209 --> 38:59.546
