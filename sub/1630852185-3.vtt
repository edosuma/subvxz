and now he's on the tube,
he's following me.

00:04.797 --> 00:06.674
-So how much longer is it gonna take?
-It will be very soon.

00:06.757 --> 00:09.260
-[Alex] So what's your dad's book about?
-[Sabina] Damian Cray.

00:09.343 --> 00:10.636
The Feathered Serpent guy.

00:10.720 --> 00:13.472
[Tom] Everyone in the world's obsessed
with Feathered Serpent apart from you.

00:14.640 --> 00:15.808
Dad.

00:16.851 --> 00:20.187
[PC Elsom] Alex, No more stories
about bombs or men with scars.

00:20.271 --> 00:22.022
His name is Yassen Gregorovich.

00:22.106 --> 00:23.524
You need to find him.

00:23.607 --> 00:25.735
As long as he's around,
none of us are safe.

00:25.818 --> 00:28.154
[Brixham]
It's a cyberattack! Shut it down!

00:28.237 --> 00:31.073
It's the work of one particular hacker.
Smoking Mirror.

[male agent] Proceeding to basement.

00:33.576 --> 00:35.119
Hey. You!

00:35.202 --> 00:36.662
Hey! Stop, stop!

00:36.746 --> 00:37.788
[grunting]

00:37.872 --> 00:39.165
Smoking Mirror.

00:39.248 --> 00:41.125
There's been a misunderstanding.

00:41.208 --> 00:43.210
Everyone get away
from the machines, right now!

00:43.294 --> 00:44.962
[beeps]

00:51.510 --> 00:54.513
[ominous music playing]

01:07.026 --> 01:08.402
[Cray] In eight days...

01:08.486 --> 01:10.488
the world is going to change.

01:12.072 --> 01:15.826
You fought the Dead Gods,
you defeated the Sun King.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.122
But nothing can prepare you
for what is coming.

01:20.956 --> 01:25.169
The world's best-selling game
reforged in flame.

01:26.337 --> 01:28.255
Will you cower in the darkness...

01:28.339 --> 01:32.468
or stand and face the wrath
of the Feathered Serpent?

01:32.551 --> 01:33.928
[hisses]

01:35.012 --> 01:37.139
You have eight days to decide.

01:48.108 --> 01:50.694
-[Charlie] And we're clear.
-Fantastic.

01:51.529 --> 01:53.280
That was good, right?
I mean, it felt great.

01:53.364 --> 01:55.324
Metrics are excellent.

01:55.407 --> 01:57.576
Live broadcast
was definitely the way to go.

01:57.660 --> 02:00.371
-I'm gonna leave the mic here, okay?
-Thank you.

02:00.454 --> 02:02.206
Thanks, everyone! Great work.

02:02.289 --> 02:03.666
-Thank you.
-[woman] Thank you, Mr. Cray.

02:05.376 --> 02:06.836
Hey, when are we in London?

02:06.919 --> 02:08.712
We leave 0900 tomorrow.

02:09.213 --> 02:11.590
You've got lunchtime interviews
for the UK news stations.

02:11.674 --> 02:13.759
I think we should follow this up
when we're there,

02:13.843 --> 02:14.885
a little something extra.

02:14.969 --> 02:16.971
-[Charlie] A little something extra?
-[Cray] Yeah, something special.

02:17.054 --> 02:20.683
You know, just a few key online voices,
top players, that kind of thing.

02:20.766 --> 02:22.476
Get that kid, what's his name? Um...

02:22.560 --> 02:24.603
-Yeah, the one with the gaming channel.
-Jonas.

02:24.687 --> 02:25.938
Jonas. Yeah, get him.

02:26.021 --> 02:27.731
And, uh, who's top of the leaderboard?

02:27.815 --> 02:29.984
-It's still K7.
-Yeah, get them too.

02:30.568 --> 02:33.612
We'll livestream it,
get a little buzz going.

02:33.696 --> 02:35.406
A face-to-face with the fans?

02:36.615 --> 02:38.075
We'd need more than 48 hours
to set that up.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.202
We'd need a venue, security, publicity--

02:40.286 --> 02:43.372
Come on. You can do it, Charlie.
That's what you're for.

02:43.455 --> 02:46.000
-We'll host it at the London office.
-There'd still be a lot to set up.

02:46.083 --> 02:48.502
Come on, get excited about this.

02:48.586 --> 02:51.088
Behind the scenes,
peek behind the curtain.

02:51.171 --> 02:53.007
It'll be fantastic.

02:53.090 --> 02:55.426
We'll make sure
the whole world's watching.

02:56.510 --> 02:57.553
Hey, Charlie.

03:00.306 --> 03:02.641
There's a research station
at the South Pole

03:03.225 --> 03:06.854
where they don't see another human being
for six months at a time.

03:06.937 --> 03:10.441
There are indigenous peoples
on islands in the South Pacific

03:10.524 --> 03:13.569
where they have no contact at all
with the outside world.

03:13.652 --> 03:17.698
There are hermits living in
the bottom of caves in utter darkness.

03:18.324 --> 03:19.241
By next week...

03:20.200 --> 03:22.077
let's make sure that all those people

03:22.161 --> 03:24.747
have pre-ordered their copy
of Feathered Serpent 2.

03:25.497 --> 03:26.874
In eight days' time...

03:28.459 --> 03:30.169

[ominous music playing]

04:19.385 --> 04:21.971
[Byrne] In a week from now,
the president arrives in London.

04:22.054 --> 04:24.723
What the hell do you suggest I tell her
about Smoking Mirror?

04:24.807 --> 04:28.686
That sometimes there are unforeseen
variables in a tactical situation.

04:28.769 --> 04:30.354
In other words, you screwed up.

04:30.437 --> 04:33.023
You spent six months over this
and never found your man.

04:33.107 --> 04:35.693
-We found him in a week.
-And lost him in a minute.

04:37.778 --> 04:40.239
Well, we'll just have to
find him again, won't we?

04:40.322 --> 04:42.533
That guy's place
was full of computer gear.

04:42.616 --> 04:46.245
That's not someone who's giving up.
That's someone who's active and planning.

04:46.328 --> 04:48.622
If there is another attack coming,
we need to know about it,

04:48.706 --> 04:49.748
we need to stop it.

04:49.832 --> 04:53.419
Smoking Mirror was untraceable
because we didn't know who he really was.

04:53.502 --> 04:56.338
That's changed.
He has a name now. Simon Mariat.

04:57.047 --> 04:59.258
Footprints we can track. We're on this.

04:59.341 --> 05:00.342
Okay.

05:04.763 --> 05:05.806
One other thing.

05:07.599 --> 05:08.517
That kid.

05:09.643 --> 05:10.769
You knew him.

05:11.812 --> 05:13.022
Who is he?

05:14.064 --> 05:16.150
Don't worry about him. He's nobody.

05:17.693 --> 05:21.613
[door opens, closes]

05:21.697 --> 05:23.157
[Alex] They lied to me.

05:24.074 --> 05:27.786
Yassen Gregorovich isn't in Myanmar.
I saw him in Cornwall.

05:27.870 --> 05:29.997
-Alex.
-They used me, Jack.

05:30.080 --> 05:31.540
They nearly got me killed.

05:31.623 --> 05:33.876
And now that they don't need me anymore...

05:33.959 --> 05:37.046
You should have heard him.
"You're not an agent. Go home."

05:37.129 --> 05:38.213
He has a point.

05:39.048 --> 05:41.884
-You're on his side?
-I wish you never met Alan Blunt.

05:41.967 --> 05:45.304
I could never be on his side.
But you are not an agent.

05:45.387 --> 05:47.056
Ed was nearly killed because of me.

05:47.723 --> 05:50.768
What if I'd said something, warned him?

05:50.851 --> 05:51.977
I could have stopped it.

05:52.061 --> 05:55.314
You have school. You have a life.

05:55.397 --> 05:57.024
I have a job.

05:57.107 --> 06:00.235
We are not a part of this.
We should leave this alone.

06:00.319 --> 06:03.572
I'm sorry, but people are in danger
and I can help them.

06:03.655 --> 06:06.283
That's the truth of it,
and that's all that matters.

06:06.366 --> 06:09.203
And if that means me having
to do the Department's job for them,

06:09.286 --> 06:10.662
then that's what I have to do.

06:15.125 --> 06:16.752
Oh, my God.

06:17.669 --> 06:20.130
-Okay, thanks. I'll call you later.
-Yes, ma'am.

06:25.302 --> 06:28.222
-Is there anything recoverable?
-Nothing.

06:28.806 --> 06:29.765
[sighs]

06:30.307 --> 06:31.809
Smoking Mirror
triggered the self-destruct button

06:31.892 --> 06:33.268
the moment he was clear.

06:33.352 --> 06:34.520
All the drives are dead.

06:34.603 --> 06:37.564
-It's all gone.
-Well, he must have left something behind.

06:37.648 --> 06:40.192
Shopping receipts. Rubbish.
Something physical.

06:40.275 --> 06:41.860
He lives off the grid.

06:42.611 --> 06:45.948
There's no driving license,
no passport, no bank account.

06:46.031 --> 06:47.658
At least not in the name
of Simon Marriat anyway.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.077
He must have gone somewhere.
We busted his home address.

06:50.160 --> 06:50.994
Where is he?

06:51.954 --> 06:55.624
He may have somewhere else,
or he could be using a hackerspace.

06:56.375 --> 06:58.210
A survival shelter, if you will.

06:58.293 --> 07:00.546
He could stay there for weeks,
maybe months.

07:00.629 --> 07:02.589
We don't have weeks or months.

07:02.673 --> 07:03.799
We need him now.

[Maisie] Well, well, well.

07:48.427 --> 07:51.930
Mr. Mirror, I was wondering
if you were gonna show up.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.184
You got people looking
for you all over London.

07:55.267 --> 07:57.186
You're lucky to be alive.

07:57.269 --> 07:58.437
Have any of them been here?

07:59.354 --> 08:02.274
They'd have to find here first.

08:02.357 --> 08:04.318
How long you planning on staying?

08:05.152 --> 08:07.905
I've booked a flight to Montenegro
a week from now.

08:08.906 --> 08:13.035
Good luck with that one, honey.
They put out an all-ports warning.

08:13.118 --> 08:14.953
High-priority alert.

08:15.746 --> 08:17.664
-Well, then a while.
-Okay.

08:17.748 --> 08:21.001
You know the rates.
Payment via the blockchain.

I'll get my bots to talk to your bots.

Go on.

Alex Rider.

09:20.686 --> 09:22.104
That's not a question.

09:22.187 --> 09:24.064
He's your agent.

09:24.147 --> 09:26.358
No. Not anymore. You heard Blunt.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.487
He came to us for help.

09:34.658 --> 09:36.660
You don't think we owe him a duty of care?

09:36.743 --> 09:38.412
Yes. Actually, I do.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.081
But what if Blunt is right?

09:41.164 --> 09:43.458
What if Alex
has been psychologically damaged

09:43.542 --> 09:45.210
because of how we used him?

09:45.294 --> 09:46.420
What we did to him?

09:47.838 --> 09:51.049
I think the best thing we can do for Alex
right now is keep him away from us.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.268
[Tom] Alex.

10:01.351 --> 10:02.185
Alex.

10:04.021 --> 10:05.522
You have got to see this.

10:06.440 --> 10:08.525
-What am I looking at?
-No, no, no. Wait for it, wait for it.

10:10.861 --> 10:14.448
-Ooh, it caught the whole fight!
-Yeah, I've seen it.

10:15.198 --> 10:16.116
I was there.

10:16.575 --> 10:18.118
Um, look, Tom, I need your help.

10:18.201 --> 10:21.246
Yeah, okay, cool. We going after
the exploding computer guy?

10:21.330 --> 10:24.374
-Uh, Smoking Mirror?
-The one that got away.

10:24.833 --> 10:26.752
Yeah, but it's not that.

10:26.835 --> 10:30.130
Um, I need to bail after registration.
Can you cover for me?

10:30.630 --> 10:33.091
Mate, I thought you meant
like actually help, like do something.

10:33.175 --> 10:36.511
-Not just, "Alex is at the dentist."
-I'm meeting Sabina.

10:36.887 --> 10:38.764
She's all on her own.

10:38.847 --> 10:42.059
It's just a couple of hours.
I'll be back before lunch.

10:42.517 --> 10:43.352
Promise.

10:44.561 --> 10:47.189
Yeah. Cool. Whatever, man.
I got you covered.

What did we do?

11:01.912 --> 11:02.913
What did we do?

11:07.834 --> 11:09.961
My goodness. Look at the two of you.

11:10.545 --> 11:12.381
Nobody's being fired, you know.

You can unclench.

All right, listen.

11:18.595 --> 11:21.640
You're doing well
on the indefinite right to remain cases.

11:21.723 --> 11:24.142
Despite the time off in Cornwall.

11:24.226 --> 11:28.313
You'll need to stay on top of those,
but I have something else for you as well.

11:28.397 --> 11:31.525
It's a little bigger,
but I'm sure you can cope.

Drug Rehabilitation Center.

11:35.445 --> 11:39.116
It's a small charity helping young people
with substance abuse.

11:39.741 --> 11:43.370
Last year, they approached
The Damian Cray Foundation for funding.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.956
-He's making a donation?
-Better than that.

11:46.039 --> 11:50.085
He wants to bring them in,
make them part of the foundation.

11:50.168 --> 11:51.711
So where do we come in?

11:51.795 --> 11:53.880
He wants us to prepare the deal.

11:54.423 --> 11:58.427
Really? I thought we were
about helping the underdogs.

11:58.510 --> 12:03.056
Cray is in charge of a global empire,
he must already have lawyers.

12:03.140 --> 12:05.350
The biggest, the best.

12:05.934 --> 12:08.103
Very impressive, very intimidating.

12:08.186 --> 12:12.482
But this is a small London charity.

12:12.566 --> 12:15.735
Oh, we're the local guys
with a friendly face.

12:15.819 --> 12:18.572
Or rather, two friendly faces.

12:20.365 --> 12:23.702
I want you to work on this... together.

after he and Mom... you know.

But this isn't his mess.

I just know.

-We should call the police.
-No.

The alarm was on. They won't believe us.

-Exactly.

13:47.827 --> 13:49.329
If someone's been here...

13:51.081 --> 13:53.416
we need to find out
what they were looking for.

13:55.085 --> 13:56.086
[indistinct chatter]

13:57.921 --> 13:59.756
[video game chiming]

13:59.839 --> 14:02.801
-Where are you up to?
-Temple of the Dead Gods.

14:02.884 --> 14:05.220
This group I'm in is just crap.

14:05.887 --> 14:06.721
You should join.

14:06.846 --> 14:09.015
What, 'cause I'd up your game,
or 'cause I'd fit right in?

14:09.099 --> 14:11.768
-I'll leave you to decide.
-Yeah. Just a sec.

14:25.949 --> 14:27.909
-What you doing?
-Nothing. Just...

14:27.993 --> 14:30.370
-We could really use your help here.
-Yeah, sure, just a sec.

14:32.914 --> 14:36.585
-Damn. We're wiped.
-Sorry. Um...

14:37.544 --> 14:39.337
Do you think that's an 8 or a B?

14:39.421 --> 14:42.132
This is what was so important?
Motorbikes?

14:42.215 --> 14:43.383
[scoffs]

14:43.466 --> 14:44.301
It's a B.

14:44.884 --> 14:46.970
-Well, look at it properly.
-I don't need to. It's a B.

14:47.679 --> 14:48.555
How can you tell?

14:48.638 --> 14:52.017
Because British format licenses
never start with a number,

14:52.100 --> 14:53.810
they start with the DVLA memory tag,

14:53.893 --> 14:56.396
which is two letters indicating
where your plate was registered,

14:56.479 --> 14:58.982
so that can't be an 8, it's a B,

14:59.065 --> 15:02.444
which is for Birmingham, which is where
your number plate was registered.

15:02.527 --> 15:05.030
It's actually pretty much
common knowledge.

15:05.864 --> 15:08.992
-Well, I didn't know that.
-Yeah, but you're pretty.

15:10.160 --> 15:12.370
[chuckles] See you.

15:15.123 --> 15:17.876
[Sabina]
Nothing about Cray in any of these.

15:17.959 --> 15:18.960
[Alex] Hmm.

15:34.476 --> 15:36.436
Did your dad ever mention
someone called Mirror?

15:36.519 --> 15:38.813
[ominous music playing]

15:38.897 --> 15:40.899
Smoking Mirror?

15:41.941 --> 15:43.485
What sort of name is that?

15:44.778 --> 15:47.113
-Does it ring any bells?
-No.

15:47.614 --> 15:48.782
Never heard of him.

15:53.244 --> 15:54.079
[sighs]

15:54.162 --> 15:57.540
Only one week to wait
until the launch of Feathered Serpent 2,

15:57.624 --> 16:01.419
and anticipation is,
to put it mildly, running a little high.

16:01.503 --> 16:03.046
I know. I made the damn thing

16:03.129 --> 16:05.507
and even I can't wait for it to come out
so I can play it.

16:05.590 --> 16:06.716
[laughs]

16:06.800 --> 16:08.927
It's good to have you back
in London, Mr. Cray.

16:09.010 --> 16:10.261
Damian, please.

16:10.845 --> 16:13.139
Uh, well, it's great to be back.

16:13.223 --> 16:16.601
I was born here, grew up here,
lived half my life here.

16:16.685 --> 16:20.605
I mean, London's still my home,
which is why, in seven days' time,

16:20.689 --> 16:23.692
I wanna be right here
in Britain's capital city

16:23.775 --> 16:27.195
when Feathered Serpent 2 launches
and we change the world.

16:27.278 --> 16:30.824
Isn't changing the world
a lot to ask of a video game?

16:31.658 --> 16:34.285
I know, right?
But here's how we're gonna start.

16:34.369 --> 16:37.080
Every penny from every copy sold

16:37.163 --> 16:39.749
is gonna go straight
to help the war on drugs.

16:39.833 --> 16:43.169
We're not gonna make any profit on this.
In fact, we're gonna run it at a loss.

16:43.253 --> 16:45.338
This is personal for you, isn't it?

16:45.839 --> 16:48.216
Yeah. It is. Um...

16:48.299 --> 16:50.301
My brother was a drug addict.

16:51.636 --> 16:53.972
His name was Joe
and drug addiction killed him.

16:54.055 --> 16:57.684
Just like it kills hundreds
of thousands of people every year

16:57.767 --> 17:02.313
and enslaves millions more
in ways that you or I can only imagine.

17:04.065 --> 17:05.567
But we're gonna end all that.

17:06.443 --> 17:09.028
You're really going to end drug addiction?

17:10.572 --> 17:12.449
You're gonna have to trust me on this.

17:12.532 --> 17:13.908
But, yes, it's true.

17:26.588 --> 17:28.631
[Alex] Anything on Cray you can find.

17:30.467 --> 17:32.969
There's a ton of stuff in here,
but it's all...

17:35.263 --> 17:36.639
-Wait. Here it is.
-There.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.434
[beeps]

17:40.185 --> 17:41.394
[Sabina] It's empty.

[beeps]

17:50.487 --> 17:51.362
[keyboard clacking]

17:55.283 --> 18:01.247
So everything your dad wrote
about Damian Cray is either burned...

18:02.540 --> 18:04.125
or stolen.

18:05.627 --> 18:06.753
Or deleted.

18:11.591 --> 18:16.471
And he found something big enough,
dangerous enough...

18:16.554 --> 18:19.265
that someone tried to kill him to hide it.

18:57.971 --> 18:58.888
There you are.

18:58.972 --> 19:01.015
What are you doing out here?
Didn't you cover for me?

19:01.099 --> 19:03.226
I did my best.
You were meant to be back before lunch.

19:03.893 --> 19:06.020
Listen, do you still think this
Smoking Mirror dude's important?

19:06.104 --> 19:07.689
Yeah, he's important.

19:07.772 --> 19:08.940
He's the link.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.817
The hospital. The Department.

19:11.442 --> 19:15.238
I think Sabina's dad even met him
before he was hurt.

19:15.321 --> 19:17.782
-He's right in the middle of everything.
-Okay. Then you're gonna wanna see this.

19:20.577 --> 19:22.954
That's his bike.
It's a 1200 cc twin-engine Triumph.

19:23.037 --> 19:24.747
That's him doing his big getaway.

19:26.207 --> 19:28.251
And that, that's his number plate.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.589
[chuckles] Nice.

19:33.423 --> 19:35.091
Nice one, Tom.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.801
Seriously. Nice one.

19:36.885 --> 19:38.720
Yeah, well, I wanted
to get you a name as well,

19:38.803 --> 19:41.306
but the police
wouldn't really wanna help on that.

19:41.598 --> 19:42.724
No, they wouldn't.

19:45.268 --> 19:46.769
I know someone who might.

20:00.408 --> 20:02.076
And what'll you have, Alex?

20:11.920 --> 20:13.046
How'd you see me?

20:14.297 --> 20:17.258
Your surveillance techniques
could use a little brushing up.

20:18.927 --> 20:20.845
-I'll work on it.
-Yeah.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.931
You better.

20:24.057 --> 20:26.225
I need to know who owns this bike.

20:28.728 --> 20:31.272
-May I ask why?
-You can ask.

20:32.607 --> 20:34.150
Someone's learning.

20:36.402 --> 20:37.612
Should be easy enough.

-Yeah.

Well...

21:01.928 --> 21:02.762

21:06.307 --> 21:09.185

called Simon Mariat.

21:14.148 --> 21:17.026
So? Who is he?

-Why do you need to know?
-I got beaten up because of this guy.

21:20.863 --> 21:23.366
The least you could do
is tell me who he is.

21:28.121 --> 21:29.497
He's a computer hacker.

21:29.580 --> 21:34.002
One of the best in the world.
He's also a wanted man.

21:35.461 --> 21:36.796

-What's the problem?
-It's a synchronization issue.

22:13.541 --> 22:16.627
It's simple. We're fixing it.

22:16.711 --> 22:18.212
When will it be fixed?

22:18.880 --> 22:20.298
I have Amsterdam on it.

22:22.091 --> 22:24.844
All teams. Two hours. Maybe three.

Two hours. Maybe three.
Well, that's okay then.

22:27.889 --> 22:30.975
That's fine. What are we worried about?
We still have seven days.

on the registration.

-Yeah. Dentist.

[door beeps]

29:31.812 --> 29:34.690
-Where you going?
-I got a meeting.

29:34.773 --> 29:36.108
An actual meeting?

29:39.236 --> 29:40.988
I hope you know what you're doing.

30:06.555 --> 30:08.390
[computer beeping]

30:15.523 --> 30:18.984
And there you are. We've got him.
Positive lock on the plates.

30:20.319 --> 30:22.571
-Where?
-Angel, heading east.

30:23.697 --> 30:27.368
There's a slight delay, but wherever
he goes, we'll be right behind him.

30:27.451 --> 30:30.454
[ominous music playing]

30:47.721 --> 30:49.265
I'm looking for a friend.

Nothing from Collier Street,
Easton Street, Wynford Street,

33:06.193 --> 33:08.320
Marlborough Gardens
and Wakefield Road.

33:08.404 --> 33:10.322
-Have we lost him?
-[Smithers] No.

33:12.199 --> 33:14.910
This is the placement
of the traffic cameras in the area

33:14.993 --> 33:16.620
he was last seen entering.

33:16.704 --> 33:19.790
If he hasn't passed through any of them,
it means he's stopped in this circle.

33:19.873 --> 33:23.293
Right. Get everyone in that zone.
We know what he looks like. Find him.

33:23.377 --> 33:24.753
How far is it from here?

33:24.837 --> 33:26.797
If you're lucky with traffic, 20 minutes.

33:26.880 --> 33:28.173
Let's go.

Alex Rider.

34:12.801 --> 34:14.136
Alex Friend.

34:20.267 --> 34:22.853
Unit Two, Control. Do you have anything?

34:22.936 --> 34:25.063
[man] Negative. No contact.

34:26.023 --> 34:27.316
He's here somewhere.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.236
Who's he meeting?

34:35.157 --> 34:36.950
-Have you got a phone?
-No.

34:37.034 --> 34:38.285
Nothing electronic?

34:40.954 --> 34:43.499
Do you have any idea how dangerous he is?

34:44.750 --> 34:48.212
Do you have any idea
how much I've risked coming here?

34:48.295 --> 34:49.463
But you came.

34:51.381 --> 34:54.218
Nobody knows the truth except me.

34:55.219 --> 34:56.345
I know.

34:57.221 --> 34:59.097
I've seen what Cray's capable of.

35:00.974 --> 35:02.100
Ed was just a journalist.

35:02.184 --> 35:06.605
But you, you're some kind of asset.

35:08.524 --> 35:14.196
I was thinking, you could bring me in
to your government friends.

35:14.279 --> 35:17.282
Get them to, I don't know, cut a deal
in exchange for what I know.

35:17.366 --> 35:20.327
If you've been telling me the truth.

35:22.871 --> 35:23.831
So prove it.

35:24.915 --> 35:28.710
Tell me what you know about Damian Cray.

35:30.420 --> 35:34.007
I was with Ed in Cornwall
the day he was nearly killed.

35:34.091 --> 35:35.759
He was writing a book about Cray.

35:35.843 --> 35:37.135
I know that.

35:37.219 --> 35:39.304
-You helped him?
-Yes. Go on.

35:39.388 --> 35:41.849
I went to his house. It's been searched.

35:41.932 --> 35:44.935
All his notes,
everything in the cloud, it's all gone.

35:45.018 --> 35:46.270
Yes? And?

35:48.522 --> 35:49.565
[sighs]

35:50.357 --> 35:51.400
Is that it?

35:52.401 --> 35:53.735
Is that all you've got?!

35:54.862 --> 35:55.946
Oh, my God.

36:11.962 --> 36:13.088
They're here.

36:15.883 --> 36:17.551
-Run.
-What?

36:18.510 --> 36:19.386
Run!

36:22.264 --> 36:24.016
[Yassen] I've been looking for you.

36:33.609 --> 36:38.864
You're a very hard man to find, Simon.
What are you doing here?

36:39.865 --> 36:42.367
[Simon] Listen, please.
You don't have to do this, you know.

36:42.451 --> 36:45.329
I can be useful. To you, you know.

36:45.412 --> 36:48.165
I know things. All sorts of things.

36:51.752 --> 36:53.337
Well, that's the problem.

We seem to be making a habit out of this.

40:42.107 --> 40:43.358
Arriving too late.

40:45.026 --> 40:46.695
It won't happen again.
