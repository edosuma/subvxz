01:45.480 --> 01:47.755
Cutting a little close,
aren't we, Mr. Sanders?

01:48.720 --> 01:49.835
l'm sorry.

01:50.000 --> 01:53.197
Better late than never doesn't cut it
in detention, young man.

01:53.360 --> 01:56.352
Be here on time
or the bus will leave without you.

01:56.920 --> 01:58.911
l had car trouble.

02:00.200 --> 02:02.191
Couldn't decide which one to drive?

02:02.360 --> 02:04.669
Mr. Wardlow, l heard that.

02:04.840 --> 02:07.070
Mr. Wardlow, Don't you have
homework? Something to read?

02:07.240 --> 02:09.071
We have an hour until school starts.

02:09.240 --> 02:12.437
How about a little cooperation
for a change, huh?

02:15.840 --> 02:17.512
Hey, Sanders.

02:17.680 --> 02:19.113
You know, l was watching
an old episode

02:19.280 --> 02:21.032
of <i>The Hartley House</i> last night.

02:21.200 --> 02:22.474
Boy, your mom,

02:22.640 --> 02:26.553
she must be one of the few
truly great actresses of our time.

02:27.200 --> 02:29.350
Why don't you clam up, bonehead.

02:29.520 --> 02:32.557
ln this episode, your mom,
she throws a dinner party

02:32.720 --> 02:35.996
and little Chuckie
steals a brownie off the dessert tray.

02:36.160 --> 02:38.628
One of those gooey, frosted kind.

02:39.440 --> 02:42.079
And naturally,
he doesn't wanna get caught with it.

02:42.240 --> 02:44.549
So he hides it on one of the chairs

02:44.720 --> 02:46.995
and one of the guests
sits right down on it.

02:47.760 --> 02:49.830
Doesn't even know it.

02:52.520 --> 02:54.715
l don't know when l laughed
so hard in my life.

02:59.760 --> 03:00.954
You son of a--

03:01.120 --> 03:03.429
You do that and you are in big,
big trouble, mister.

03:29.400 --> 03:30.674
Brandon.

03:30.840 --> 03:31.909
- Hi.
- Hey, Andrea.

03:32.080 --> 03:35.356
Well, l finally had a major
breakthrough in my hypnotherapy.

03:35.520 --> 03:37.829
Oh, wait a minute,
you're in hypnotherapy?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.877
- Yeah, what's wrong with that?
- Nothing.

03:40.040 --> 03:42.429
lt's not being hypnotised,
it's just you being hypnotised.

03:42.600 --> 03:44.397
That is exactly why
l never mentioned it to you.

03:44.560 --> 03:47.358
Look at you, you think
it sounds bogus, it's not that strange.

03:47.520 --> 03:50.114
Police hire psychics all the time
to solve crimes, this is just one--

03:50.280 --> 03:52.032
You're not going new age
on us, are you?

03:52.200 --> 03:53.394
No.

03:53.560 --> 03:57.189
l just feel like it's the only hope
l have of remembering the accident.

03:57.360 --> 03:59.430
At this point,
l thought you'd be trying to forget it.

03:59.600 --> 04:02.319
That's just it, l can't. So l keep going
under hoping that l'll remember

04:02.480 --> 04:04.357
so l can get a grip on things.
You know, Brandon,

04:04.520 --> 04:06.988
the only thing l can remember
is a silver car rushing at me

04:07.160 --> 04:09.469
and then yesterday there it was.

04:10.080 --> 04:13.356
- There what was?
- Stars, just as the car hit me.

04:14.720 --> 04:17.951
Stars? Like in a cartoon
when someone gets hit over the head?

04:18.120 --> 04:21.156
No, stars,
as in dangling from the mirror.

04:23.360 --> 04:24.759
l mean,

04:25.400 --> 04:27.356
that's what l think they were.

04:27.880 --> 04:30.189
Well, l'm glad
you're starting to remember.

04:30.360 --> 04:32.715
Yeah, me too.

04:40.880 --> 04:43.872
What l've learned from these science
classes is never to take another one.

04:44.040 --> 04:45.359
Well, you shouldn't take physics,

04:45.520 --> 04:47.317
chemistry and bio
in the same semester.

04:47.480 --> 04:49.391
lf there's any chance
of me graduating with you,

04:49.560 --> 04:52.711
Brandon and everyone else by June,
l don't have any other choice.

04:53.680 --> 04:56.069
Well, can l help out somehow?

04:58.840 --> 05:00.432
Well, l'm nearing total meltdown.

05:00.600 --> 05:03.717
l need more time and this radio show
is the only thing l can give up

05:03.880 --> 05:06.792
and that means l'd have to put it
in the hands of Tim Bu <i>rw</i> ell.

05:06.960 --> 05:08.188
Well, Tim's okay.

05:08.360 --> 05:11.113
My grandfather's okay, that doesn't
mean l want him picking out the tunes

05:11.280 --> 05:13.191
we listen to in the morning.

05:14.360 --> 05:15.759
Now, this is what's killing me.

05:15.920 --> 05:19.117
Do you have idea how many bones
there are in the human body?

05:21.200 --> 05:22.758
Two hundred and six?

05:23.920 --> 05:25.592
How did you know that?

05:25.840 --> 05:27.558
l took biology last semester.

05:27.720 --> 05:30.473
No, l mean, how'd you know
how to cue up the CD.

05:33.160 --> 05:34.912
Watching you.

05:40.360 --> 05:43.272
Dylan, you got two beautiful girls
after you, l'd hardly call it trapped.

05:43.440 --> 05:45.192
They're forcing me to pick
between them, man.

05:45.360 --> 05:46.952
You can call it whatever you want.

05:48.640 --> 05:50.710
Are you going shopping?

05:55.520 --> 05:57.397
l call that trapped.

06:01.480 --> 06:02.879
What?

06:04.200 --> 06:05.838
Let's go.

06:08.440 --> 06:10.158
l got an idea.

06:10.760 --> 06:13.320
Maybe the girls would go for some
sort of a timeshare agreement.

06:13.480 --> 06:14.515
Oh, man, this ain't funny.

06:14.680 --> 06:16.432
Well, it's not exactly
tragic either, is it?

06:16.600 --> 06:19.273
Any way you look at it, it's not
a good situation. You know me, man,

06:19.440 --> 06:21.556
l don't respond well to ultimatums.

06:22.920 --> 06:25.480
Mrs. Teasley is so cute
when she's mad, don't you think?

06:25.640 --> 06:28.473
Next time you feel like almost
getting expelled, leave me out of it.

06:28.640 --> 06:30.790
Hey, mellow out, man,
she wasn't gonna kick us out.

06:30.960 --> 06:32.632
l know this may not mean
anything to you

06:32.800 --> 06:34.313
but l'm trying to graduate, all right.

06:34.480 --> 06:36.391
- So leave me alone.
- You're a role model, Sanders.

06:36.560 --> 06:38.949
You really are.
By the way, nice sweats.

06:39.120 --> 06:41.634
lt's good to see you're making
new friends in detention, Steve.

06:41.800 --> 06:44.394
Wardlow's still in detention? He's
been there since he was a freshman.

06:44.560 --> 06:45.675
The guy gets his mail there.

06:45.840 --> 06:47.671
l'm a first-time offender
in there with lifers.

06:47.840 --> 06:49.637
- So when are you eligible for parole?
- Never.

06:49.800 --> 06:51.438
Never. Detention
is total <i>Three Stooges</i>.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.272
l'm not gonna make it
to the end of the year.

06:53.440 --> 06:54.668
l think
you're gonna make it, man.

06:54.840 --> 06:56.239
You gotta take it
one day at a time,

06:56.400 --> 06:58.470
you gotta pace yourself, you gotta...

07:00.120 --> 07:04.910
No, no, no, l'm sorry.
l just can't put you into that deal.

07:05.480 --> 07:09.519
The rate of return
doesn't justify taking that kind of risk.

07:10.800 --> 07:13.473
Fine, fine. Have your broker
send me a prospectus

07:13.640 --> 07:16.234
and l'll talk to you in the morning.

07:16.920 --> 07:19.275
The guy hires me because he wants
a slow and steady approach

07:19.440 --> 07:21.476
but it's one get-rich-quick scheme
after another.

07:21.640 --> 07:24.234
l don't know, Dad. Quick sounds
like a good way to get rich to me.

07:24.400 --> 07:25.628
That's what everybody thought.

07:25.800 --> 07:26.994
The whole country's waking up.

07:27.160 --> 07:28.434
Brandon, the party's over.

07:29.280 --> 07:31.350
So l guess now isn't a good time
to hit you up

07:31.520 --> 07:32.589
for a new pair of skis, huh?

07:34.640 --> 07:35.789
Boots?

07:36.600 --> 07:37.828
- Poles?
- Brandon.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.753
Hey, Dad, nobody told me
the party was over, okay?

07:43.960 --> 07:45.678
lt just doesn't sound like Dylan,

07:45.840 --> 07:47.671
sneaking around
dodging you guys like that.

07:47.840 --> 07:49.592
Believe me, it's not a pretty picture.

07:49.760 --> 07:51.955
lt's not like you two
to be so passive, either.

07:52.120 --> 07:54.315
Yeah, well,
what else can we do, Mom?

07:54.480 --> 07:57.074
You know, if it were up to Dylan,

07:57.240 --> 07:58.753
he would see Kelly on Mondays

07:58.920 --> 08:00.990
and he would see me on Tuesdays.

08:01.160 --> 08:03.958
Well, maybe this whole ultimatum
thing wasn't such a good idea.

08:04.120 --> 08:06.156
Why are we giving Dylan
all the power?

08:06.320 --> 08:08.276
Well, what happens
when he makes up his mind?

08:09.080 --> 08:10.672
We don't know.

08:11.560 --> 08:14.711
Hey, you know, l was talking
to Joyce Maynard, my tennis partner,

08:14.880 --> 08:17.997
and her other doubles partner, well,
she has a son who goes to Princeton.

08:18.640 --> 08:19.629
Princeton?

08:19.800 --> 08:22.473
And he has a friend,
also a Princeton man

08:22.640 --> 08:26.189
and they were looking for a night on
the town. A double-date kind of thing.

08:36.280 --> 08:37.554
Okay.

08:37.720 --> 08:39.756
Now, you have
about a minute left on this cut.

08:39.919 --> 08:41.148
A minute.

08:41.320 --> 08:42.673
Well, actually, 55 seconds.

08:42.840 --> 08:45.513
Now, the moment this song stops

08:45.680 --> 08:47.432
you run that DJ intro
you were doing for me,

08:47.600 --> 08:50.592
punch in the next cut
and bam, you're out.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.432
Okay?

08:52.600 --> 08:55.319
Now, do you remember
which buttons to push?

08:56.120 --> 08:57.633
Right here.

08:58.360 --> 08:59.475
Okay, good.

08:59.640 --> 09:04.555
Now, just relax and pretend
you're talking to your best friend, okay?

09:10.160 --> 09:11.593
Brenda, l've been thinking about it,

09:11.760 --> 09:13.352
l've never been very good
at double-dating,

09:13.520 --> 09:16.034
even when everybody knows
each other. But a blind double date?

09:16.200 --> 09:17.519
l don't think so.

09:17.680 --> 09:20.148
Look, Kelly, they're lvy League
from Princeton.

09:20.320 --> 09:22.880
My Dad said Woodrow Wilson
went there, F. Scott Fitzgerald.

09:23.040 --> 09:24.439
Didn't Brooke Shields go there?

09:24.600 --> 09:25.828
My point exactly.

09:26.320 --> 09:28.709
<i>And now l'd like to introduce</i>
<i>my temporary replacement,</i>

09:28.880 --> 09:30.871
<i>Look out Howard Stern,</i>
<i>here's Donna Martin,</i>

09:31.960 --> 09:35.589
<i>Good morning, West</i> B <i>everly,</i>

09:35.760 --> 09:38.149
<i>This is Donna,</i>

09:38.800 --> 09:40.392
<i>Donna,,,</i>

09:43.480 --> 09:45.436
- Call 91 1 .
- She's dying.

09:45.600 --> 09:46.999
Let's go.

09:47.160 --> 09:49.230
Donna, you gotta talk louder.

09:50.480 --> 09:52.391
This is Donna.

09:53.760 --> 09:57.639
Donna coming to you from--

09:58.480 --> 09:59.959
Where am l?

10:00.800 --> 10:02.119
l can't do this, David.

10:02.280 --> 10:04.430
Donna. Forget about them, okay?

10:04.600 --> 10:06.716
lt's just the two of us in here.
Just forget about them.

10:06.880 --> 10:07.915
Come on, come on.

10:10.280 --> 10:13.158
l'm coming to you from a room

10:14.040 --> 10:16.600
<i>which l'm sharing with David Silver,</i>

10:17.080 --> 10:20.709
My very understanding coach.

10:20.880 --> 10:24.509
He'll be on vacation for a while,
doing the study thing,

10:24.680 --> 10:27.148
getting ready
for an early graduation.

10:27.320 --> 10:29.629
And won't he look good this June
in his cap and gown.

10:29.800 --> 10:30.789
Yes.

10:30.960 --> 10:34.350
Okay, well, now we're ready for...

10:34.880 --> 10:36.393
Okay.

10:40.520 --> 10:42.636
Where does the makeup go?

10:42.800 --> 10:45.951
You know, you put it on in the
morning and an hour later it's gone.

10:46.120 --> 10:47.872
Across the country
there must be like

10:48.040 --> 10:49.837
<i>tons of cosmetics</i>
<i>just vanishing in high schools</i>

10:50.000 --> 10:51.752
without a trace.

10:52.240 --> 10:53.753
Where does it all go?
The answer to this

10:53.920 --> 10:57.515
and many other puzzling questions
of the universe coming up.

10:59.800 --> 11:01.916
David that was-- Wow, what a rush.

11:02.080 --> 11:04.640
You were right, the trick
is to just talk to one person.

11:04.800 --> 11:07.234
All you were supposed to do was
give the intro and cue the song.

11:07.400 --> 11:08.719
No one wants to hear
about makeup.

11:08.880 --> 11:10.552
What do you mean?

11:18.200 --> 11:19.918
Well, am l fired?

11:20.080 --> 11:21.877
- No.
- Did l do good?

11:24.040 --> 11:25.189
You'll get better.

11:26.160 --> 11:27.513
B <i>etter,</i>

11:46.040 --> 11:48.110
Get-- Get out of there.

11:51.240 --> 11:53.959
Wardlow. Where are you?

11:54.120 --> 11:56.156
l know you're here.
Come out, you weasel.

11:56.960 --> 11:58.188
Hey, now, who could forget

11:58.360 --> 12:00.555
about <i>The Hartley House</i>
''Chicken and the Egg'' episode?

12:00.720 --> 12:01.709
Oh, you're hysterical.

12:02.640 --> 12:04.039
Or was it
''The Egg and the Chicken''?

12:04.480 --> 12:06.471
You wanna pick on me,
you give it your best shot.

12:06.640 --> 12:08.119
But keep your ass
away from my car.

12:08.280 --> 12:09.998
This is my car. My <i>V</i> ette. Look at it.

12:10.480 --> 12:12.710
You're right, Sanders.
Your car didn't do anything to me.

12:13.280 --> 12:14.952
l never did anything to you.

12:15.120 --> 12:16.235
Hey, it's all right, man.

12:16.400 --> 12:18.311
They were only in there
a couple of minutes.

12:18.480 --> 12:20.835
Come on, l've got some rags
in my trunk.

12:26.320 --> 12:27.833
Nitrous oxide?

12:28.000 --> 12:29.991
That stuff rots your brains.

12:30.800 --> 12:32.233
l don't breathe it.

12:38.960 --> 12:41.076
- My engine does.
- My God.

12:41.240 --> 12:44.312
Yanko carb conversion.
Headers. Full race cam.

12:44.480 --> 12:45.549
That's more than my <i>V</i> ette.

12:47.120 --> 12:49.953
- l bet you can't even change your oil.
- Change the oil?

12:50.120 --> 12:52.998
Aren't you supposed to toss the car
when the oil's dirty?

12:53.920 --> 12:55.797
Yeah, you're all right, Sanders.

12:56.680 --> 12:58.955
When do l get to drive this thing?

12:59.120 --> 13:00.235
Nobody drives my car.

13:00.640 --> 13:01.993
Nobody.

13:02.160 --> 13:03.957
How fast is this thing?

13:06.360 --> 13:08.078
Can l trust you?

13:09.120 --> 13:10.439
You already have.

13:10.600 --> 13:12.079
l know which car is yours now.

13:13.800 --> 13:15.199
What are you doing later on today?

13:15.360 --> 13:16.713
Why don't you tell me.

13:24.560 --> 13:26.630
All right, lndustrial Avenue.
We're here.

13:26.800 --> 13:28.199
Now, will you tell me
why we're here?

13:28.360 --> 13:29.679
For you, Brandon. You love cars.

13:29.840 --> 13:31.751
Sanders.

13:31.920 --> 13:34.593
l thought you said this guy
was public enemy number one?

13:34.760 --> 13:36.079
He is.

13:36.240 --> 13:38.037
Hey, l didn't think
you were gonna show up, man.

13:38.200 --> 13:40.589
This place wasn't easy to find.
Joe Wardlow, Brandon Walsh.

13:40.760 --> 13:41.988
- We met in the hall.
- Yeah.

13:42.160 --> 13:44.355
Sanders, think you can lend me
a hundred bucks.

13:44.520 --> 13:46.954
No. No, l don't think
l can lend you a hundred bucks.

13:47.120 --> 13:49.429
Don't invite somebody,
then hit them up for a hundred bucks.

13:49.600 --> 13:51.397
Wait a minute,
you guys are racing for money?

13:51.560 --> 13:53.949
Come on, Steve, the guy l was
gonna stake me crapped out, man.

13:54.120 --> 13:55.678
l need a hundred.
l got the other half.

13:55.840 --> 13:57.671
Loan me the money.
l'll pay you back, l swear.

13:57.840 --> 14:00.400
Come on, this guy is a total loser,
man. l'll wear him out.

14:00.560 --> 14:01.993
l'm in for 40.

14:02.160 --> 14:03.559
Brandon, you wanna lose
your paycheque?

14:03.720 --> 14:04.914
No, brother, l wanna double it.

14:05.080 --> 14:07.150
But this will be worth it
in entertainment value alone.

14:07.760 --> 14:09.512
Steve, if you don't wanna do this,
that's fine.

14:09.680 --> 14:12.558
- This sounds like a sure thing.
- No, it sounds like a Joe thing.

14:12.720 --> 14:14.517
Come on, Steve.

14:16.200 --> 14:17.997
Steve, come on.

14:18.640 --> 14:21.279
- Do it, do it, do it.
- Why not?

14:22.920 --> 14:24.069
- Here, Wardlow.
- Cool.

14:24.240 --> 14:25.309
You guys work it out, man.

14:26.120 --> 14:27.599
We got a race.

14:27.760 --> 14:28.749
Here's the rest.

14:28.920 --> 14:31.639
l'm in for 40, right? l'm in.

15:05.040 --> 15:06.314
Come on, baby. Come on, baby.

15:07.760 --> 15:08.749
Man.

15:22.280 --> 15:23.759
He won.

15:32.000 --> 15:35.675
Two hundred bucks, man. Cops get
here pretty quick. l'll see you in prison.

15:35.840 --> 15:38.035
Know how long it takes
to make this money at the Peach Pit?

15:38.200 --> 15:40.395
Don't tell me. lt'll depress me.

15:41.960 --> 15:43.552
- This is unreal.
- When's the next race?

15:43.720 --> 15:45.358
- No idea.
- Well, you find out, you tell me.

15:45.520 --> 15:47.158
Because this is me.

16:12.360 --> 16:14.794
How long is this gonna go on
with Dylan on one side of the room

16:14.960 --> 16:17.599
- and you two on the other?
- Oh, is Dylan here?

16:18.160 --> 16:21.596
Bren, do you still think that Princeton
double-date thing is open?

16:21.760 --> 16:23.751
- l know it is.
- Let's go for it.

16:23.920 --> 16:26.957
- Hi, guys. Congratulations, Donna.
- Thank you.

16:27.120 --> 16:29.509
lt's time we heard the sound
of a girl's voice on the ai <i>rw</i> aves.

16:29.680 --> 16:30.795
Not that l don't like David's.

16:30.960 --> 16:34.635
Oh, speaking of David, l was supposed
to tell you that he might drop by.

16:34.800 --> 16:35.835
Donna.

16:36.000 --> 16:37.592
- l thought you had to study.
- Well, l do.

16:37.760 --> 16:39.432
But l have a few ideas
for the show tomorrow.

16:39.600 --> 16:41.397
David, l'll be okay.

16:41.560 --> 16:43.949
Well, that's fine.
Let's just go over the play list.

16:44.120 --> 16:46.350
- Excuse us, this is business.
- All right.

16:46.920 --> 16:48.399
We're out of here too, Andrea.
See you.

16:48.560 --> 16:49.993
- All right, bye.
- Bye.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.953
- Do you know what nitrous does?
- Listen, bro, this guy's a scammer.

16:55.120 --> 16:57.759
- lncredible.
- Amazing.

17:00.720 --> 17:02.312
All right,
what can l get for you, chief?

17:02.480 --> 17:03.833
l'll have an iced tea.

17:05.720 --> 17:07.039
Oh, she's talking to me.

17:08.040 --> 17:09.837
What are Dylan and Steve plotting?

17:11.440 --> 17:12.953
l'm sworn to secrecy.

17:15.119 --> 17:17.190
Steve, l'm telling you,
Wardlow's a scammer.

17:17.359 --> 17:19.430
l think l'd would know
if something was up.

17:19.599 --> 17:21.032
Does this sound familiar to you?

17:21.200 --> 17:23.191
Joe discovers
that you're both interested in cars.

17:23.359 --> 17:26.193
Not really so hard for Joe
because you drive a ZR-1 .

17:26.359 --> 17:29.557
He takes you to a race, next thing
you know, he asks you to stake him.

17:30.480 --> 17:33.472
- He did say he was a little short.
- Right, now, Steve, l know you won.

17:33.640 --> 17:36.518
But next time, stakes are gonna be
higher, you are not gonna be so lucky.

17:36.680 --> 17:38.079
You mean they fix the races?

17:38.240 --> 17:40.629
Oh, come on, you were there.
How honest does that look to you?

17:41.360 --> 17:43.430
- Well, we did all right.
- Maybe we should back out.

17:43.600 --> 17:45.352
And mess with my retirement plan?

17:45.520 --> 17:46.919
Gentlemen.

17:47.080 --> 17:49.719
There has to be another way
to get around this.

17:51.640 --> 17:53.631
What's this about a race?

17:56.760 --> 17:57.749
lt's no big thing.

17:57.920 --> 17:59.911
The nearest legal drag strip
is about 90 miles away,

18:00.080 --> 18:03.117
so some guys
just run their cars on the street.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.272
And you're involved in this?

18:05.440 --> 18:07.635
Even though you know
l was nearly killed by some moron

18:07.800 --> 18:09.631
who thought that Benton Avenue
was a race track?

18:10.480 --> 18:12.516
l didn't want you to hear
about this, Andrea.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.432
Because you know
you shouldn't be doing it.

18:14.600 --> 18:16.431
Guys, l have been in physical
and hypnotherapy

18:16.600 --> 18:19.068
for the past two months now
because of that jerk.

18:19.240 --> 18:20.229
Hypnotherapy?

18:20.400 --> 18:22.834
What's that, some guy with a beard
waves a watch across your face,

18:23.000 --> 18:24.115
tells you to bark like a dog?

18:25.200 --> 18:26.679
Look, it's serious, okay, Steve.

18:28.000 --> 18:28.989
l'm sorry.

18:29.160 --> 18:31.594
Maybe soon l can sleep
two nights in a row

18:31.760 --> 18:33.671
without waking up in a cold sweat.

18:34.320 --> 18:35.594
l didn't know it was that serious.

18:36.400 --> 18:37.958
l can't believe you guys
are doing this.

18:39.400 --> 18:41.231
Joe will probably
hit you up tomorrow.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.152
How many more reasons
do you need to say no?

18:56.160 --> 18:58.515
Morning, Steve. Brownie?

18:58.680 --> 19:00.238
Just kidding.

19:00.440 --> 19:02.237
How'd you like the race?

19:02.440 --> 19:03.429
lt was pretty cool.

19:03.600 --> 19:06.717
That was running first gear compared
to what l got lined up now, man.

19:06.880 --> 19:08.074
This is the race, Sanders.

19:08.240 --> 19:09.798
Mega fast, mega bucks.

19:09.960 --> 19:12.394
Like yesterday, l will prevail.

19:12.560 --> 19:14.232
lf l back you, right?

19:14.400 --> 19:16.436
You ready for the majors?

19:16.880 --> 19:18.996
Go to a bank, Wardlow.

19:19.960 --> 19:21.439
- l thought l'd found a friend.
- No.

19:21.600 --> 19:23.795
You thought you'd found a sucker.

19:24.760 --> 19:26.352
No big deal.

19:26.520 --> 19:28.272
l'll find someone else.

19:29.040 --> 19:30.314
<i>Well, all right, West</i> B <i>everly,</i>

19:30.480 --> 19:32.755
<i>Okay, so l was</i>
<i>blitz-shopping Melrose yesterday</i>

19:32.920 --> 19:38.040
<i>and l see Jockey for her,</i>
<i>Calvin Klein for her,</i> B <i>VD for her,</i>

19:38.200 --> 19:39.872
<i>Now, l don't get it,</i>
<i>l mean, l don't see them</i>

19:40.040 --> 19:41.678
<i>making Maidenform for him,</i>

19:41.840 --> 19:44.400
<i>l'm a little confused,</i>
<i>ls anyone out there confused?</i>

19:48.640 --> 19:50.790
Donna, that wasn't the routine
we rehearsed yesterday.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.791
l know, but l didn't think of it
until just now.

19:53.480 --> 19:55.038
This song isn't even on the play list.

19:55.200 --> 19:56.792
Yeah, but you have to admit
it does fit.

19:57.760 --> 19:59.113
lt's okay.

19:59.280 --> 20:00.872
Look, David, everything is fine.

20:01.040 --> 20:03.429
The second this cut is done,
l'll get back to your play list.

20:04.880 --> 20:06.518
Okay. l'm sorry.

20:07.400 --> 20:09.834
So when do you wanna go
over the show for tomorrow?

20:11.600 --> 20:13.397
So they'll pick us up tonight
at my house at 8.

20:13.560 --> 20:14.595
What do they look like?

20:14.760 --> 20:16.398
l don't know.
l just talked to one of them.

20:16.560 --> 20:17.629
What did he sound like?

20:17.800 --> 20:20.075
<i>V</i> ery handsome. <i>V</i> ery Princeton.

20:20.240 --> 20:21.719
lt'll be a blast.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.235
God, l haven't had a date
yet this year.

20:24.400 --> 20:27.198
Yeah and if it were up to Dylan,
you'd still be saying that on prom night.

20:27.360 --> 20:28.349
Both of us would.

20:28.520 --> 20:30.112
Well, l'm ready.

20:30.920 --> 20:32.239
Lately, between you and me,

20:32.400 --> 20:34.789
l've been thinking
of how lucky Donna is to have David.

20:34.960 --> 20:37.190
You know, David, we could be
going out tonight, as planned,

20:37.360 --> 20:40.318
if you'd been studying instead
of leaning over me in the DJ booth.

20:40.480 --> 20:42.436
lt's just until you get the hang of it.

20:42.600 --> 20:45.592
l've got the hang of it. You're the one
who thinks l'm doing everything wrong.

20:45.760 --> 20:47.876
No one wants to hear a show
about makeup and unde <i>rw</i> ear.

20:48.040 --> 20:49.109
- Do they?
- l do.

20:49.280 --> 20:51.111
Me too.
Unde <i>rw</i> ear more than makeup.

20:51.280 --> 20:53.840
Makeup more than unde <i>rw</i> ear.
Well, maybe you're right.

20:55.000 --> 20:57.468
David, l was just doing this
to help you out.

20:57.640 --> 20:59.232
Thank you.

20:59.400 --> 21:01.675
Look, l gotta go study.

21:04.840 --> 21:06.990
So you guys up for a movie tonight?

21:07.160 --> 21:09.469
Sorry, Don, we've got plans.

21:09.640 --> 21:12.757
Oh. Well, do your plans
have a friend, by chance?

21:14.960 --> 21:18.350
Maybe racing cars isn't exactly
the kind of extracurricular activity

21:18.520 --> 21:21.159
you can put on a college application,
but it's something, Steve.

21:21.320 --> 21:22.958
Joe works hard at it.

21:23.120 --> 21:25.554
l think it's time we spoke
about Joe's character flaws, Brandon.

21:25.720 --> 21:28.393
Granted. But l wish you could've
heard him talk about this race.

21:28.560 --> 21:32.075
lf he wins this thing, he'll be the
hea <i>vyw</i> eight champion of the world.

21:32.240 --> 21:35.357
lt's a big competition,
l really don't think he's gonna throw it.

21:35.520 --> 21:37.351
But if you don't want to back him,
that's fine.

21:37.520 --> 21:40.876
But if you do, l'm in for 200.

21:41.040 --> 21:42.109
How much does he want?

21:42.280 --> 21:43.918
- Fifteen hundred bucks.
- No, really?

21:44.080 --> 21:46.310
- Really, 1 500 bucks.
- Fifteen hundred bucks?

21:46.480 --> 21:48.596
So you put in a couple
and l put up the rest, huh?

21:48.760 --> 21:50.796
Steve, if we win it's three grand.

21:50.960 --> 21:53.030
Or zero if Joe takes a dive.

21:53.200 --> 21:56.590
Dylan, if you don't want in,
that's fine. No one's twisting your arm.

21:56.760 --> 21:59.752
- So who's he running anyway?
- This guy Frank Padilla.

21:59.920 --> 22:01.319
- Padilla?
- You know him?

22:01.480 --> 22:05.029
Yeah, l know him. About 30,
drug dealer, done a little time.

22:05.200 --> 22:07.919
You guys obviously don't know the
crowd that hangs at these things, man.

22:08.080 --> 22:10.958
l used to run cars with these guys,
the whole thing isn't worth three grand.

22:11.120 --> 22:12.109
lt's not about money.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.351
- What's it about?
- lt's about winning.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.078
- lt's about winning money.
- Fine.

22:16.240 --> 22:18.629
lt is about money. Because
if l had the money to back him

22:18.800 --> 22:21.360
we wouldn't be standing here
having this conversation right now.

22:21.520 --> 22:22.509
Dylan, it's no big deal.

22:22.680 --> 22:24.398
Hey, you guys
wanna go play teen outlaw,

22:24.560 --> 22:26.471
be my guest.
Just don't say l didn't warn you.

22:54.080 --> 22:57.436
Oh, l cannot believe
l'm actually nervous.

22:57.600 --> 23:00.239
What if we run out of things
to talk about?

23:00.400 --> 23:02.709
Talk about Princeton.
Pretend you applied.

23:02.880 --> 23:04.472
ln other words, talk about them?

23:04.640 --> 23:06.631
lt always seems to work.

23:10.480 --> 23:11.754
l hope they're not too preppy.

23:11.920 --> 23:14.070
l don't know. Right now,
we could both use a little dose

23:14.240 --> 23:16.390
of lvy League cachet. Let's go.

23:27.120 --> 23:29.554
This is Wayne and this is Adam.

23:30.040 --> 23:32.873
This is Brenda and Kelly.

23:34.760 --> 23:36.751
Thank you, God.

23:42.320 --> 23:44.390
You guys don't really go
to Princeton, do you?

23:45.080 --> 23:47.833
Yeah. Yeah, we do. We go
to the Princeton School in Encino.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.468
Making boys into men.

23:51.520 --> 23:52.873
Brenda.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.388
See, we thought
you were college guys.

23:59.440 --> 24:01.351
Okay, well,

24:01.520 --> 24:03.795
we don't have to go out
if you don't want to.

24:03.960 --> 24:06.599
No, of course you're going out.

24:13.040 --> 24:15.508
We are gonna have so much fun.

24:15.680 --> 24:17.318
l can just feel it.

24:23.960 --> 24:27.191
After everything we went through,
this guy better show.

24:27.720 --> 24:29.756
He will show. He loves the combat.

24:29.920 --> 24:31.672
Yeah, tell me again.

25:04.240 --> 25:05.958
That's Frank Padilla?

25:06.120 --> 25:07.553
No.

25:11.560 --> 25:13.790
That's Frank Padilla.

25:18.800 --> 25:20.313
You're gonna race that?

25:22.920 --> 25:24.319
lt must be my birthday.

25:41.400 --> 25:43.709
lf that one tells another blond joke,
l'm gonna kill him.

25:43.880 --> 25:45.313
Kelly.

25:45.840 --> 25:48.400
Oh, boy, l'm really glad
we got all dressed up for this.

25:48.560 --> 25:52.439
And l think your single strand of pearls
was a nice choice. Understated.

25:52.600 --> 25:54.989
Just like ''Total Carnage.''

25:57.240 --> 25:59.515
Okay, Bren,
it's time to cut our losses here.

25:59.680 --> 26:03.593
Kelly, we cannot ditch these guys.
My mom plays tennis with their moms.

26:03.760 --> 26:05.990
lf you can't say no to this...?

26:06.160 --> 26:09.152
What ever happened to setting limits,
you know?

26:10.280 --> 26:12.430
- Okay.
- Thank you.

26:25.160 --> 26:26.388
Hello.

26:26.560 --> 26:27.629
Hello there.

26:27.800 --> 26:29.279
We're on level ten.
That's the highest.

26:34.000 --> 26:36.230
Look, the truth is, l'm really sick.

26:36.400 --> 26:37.799
Both of us are.

26:41.360 --> 26:43.476
Oh, great, just show off for the girls.

26:48.080 --> 26:50.548
- Level 1 1 . Yeah.
- Oh, level 1 1 .

26:52.560 --> 26:55.233
Wait. l thought you said
there were only ten levels.

26:55.400 --> 26:57.834
We're going where
no man's gone before.

27:03.280 --> 27:04.998
Who's to say there isn't a level 1 1 1

27:05.160 --> 27:06.229
or a million and 1 1 ?

27:06.400 --> 27:08.436
We gonna die here, Brenda.

27:12.160 --> 27:13.593
l don't mean to brag,

27:13.760 --> 27:16.558
but l was a reigning ''Cosmo Gang''
champion of Wayzata

27:16.720 --> 27:18.278
in '85 through '87.

27:18.640 --> 27:21.871
That is nothing to brag about, Bren.
That was the Midwest.

27:22.040 --> 27:25.715
Everybody knows the action was in
Westwood and l was the kid to beat.

27:29.880 --> 27:34.032
You know, at first l thought
$1 500 was a little crazy,

27:34.200 --> 27:36.555
but, well, actually,
l still think it is a little crazy.

27:36.720 --> 27:38.438
l think Joe's got a shot, though.

27:39.160 --> 27:40.513
Brandon.

27:41.240 --> 27:43.151
Hello, McFly?

27:43.320 --> 27:46.756
Andrea said she remembered
one thing about the car that hit her.

27:47.160 --> 27:49.435
- Stars.
- Stars?

27:49.600 --> 27:52.558
This isn't more of that
hypnotherapy business?

27:55.320 --> 27:56.309
Oh, my God.

27:56.920 --> 27:59.036
Brandon, you don't think
this is the car, do you?

27:59.200 --> 28:00.189
Great. No plates.

28:00.360 --> 28:02.157
How many cars have stars hanging
from the mirror?

28:02.320 --> 28:04.834
lt's not just that. Andrea always said
it was a silver muscle car.

28:05.000 --> 28:06.638
''Muscle car''
doesn't describe this monster.

28:06.800 --> 28:09.553
A machine driven by a guy who
didn't even stop to see if she was alive.

28:09.720 --> 28:11.438
Brandon, we gotta do something.

28:11.600 --> 28:13.511
Steve, we're in way over our heads.

28:13.680 --> 28:15.591
Bran, go get the cops,
l'll stall them here somehow.

28:15.760 --> 28:16.875
lt'll take half an hour.

28:17.040 --> 28:18.109
Just go, l'll manage.

28:18.280 --> 28:20.236
What am l gonna tell them?
He has stars.

28:20.400 --> 28:22.994
- Get Andrea to lD this guy.
- How can you hold them that long?

28:23.160 --> 28:25.913
Just go. l'll handle it somehow.

28:49.120 --> 28:51.031
l wanna see this car.

28:51.760 --> 28:53.398
Steve, we just did.

28:53.560 --> 28:54.788
l didn't.

28:54.960 --> 28:58.430
Deep pockets gets three minutes
and that's it.

28:59.280 --> 29:01.350
Steve.

29:02.800 --> 29:04.313
Here you go.

29:20.240 --> 29:21.992
What's the geek's name?

29:22.160 --> 29:23.718
- Wayne.
- No, the other geek

29:23.880 --> 29:25.711
that went where
no geek has gone before.

29:25.880 --> 29:26.915
Adam.

29:27.080 --> 29:28.832
Take that, Adam.

29:29.000 --> 29:30.956
Let's not forget about Wayne.

29:44.760 --> 29:47.433
- All right, after you, man.
- Cool.

29:50.560 --> 29:53.870
lt's a really good sign that you want a
memento of our double date from hell.

29:54.040 --> 29:56.076
Well, without some proof
l'd probably start to wonder

29:56.240 --> 29:57.719
if it ever really happened.

30:12.920 --> 30:14.478
Now what are you doing, man?

30:14.640 --> 30:16.392
Just checking the radiator.

30:16.560 --> 30:19.870
The race lasts 1 2 seconds, man.
There's nothing gonna overheat.

30:20.040 --> 30:22.429
This car doesn't have an air filter.

30:22.600 --> 30:24.272
There's not supposed to be one.

30:24.440 --> 30:26.317
Hey, man,
you're making me look bad.

30:26.480 --> 30:29.472
You don't need me
to make you look bad, Wardlow.

30:30.240 --> 30:32.800
You know, it wasn't exactly easy
to get in touch with this guy

30:32.960 --> 30:34.951
and he's about to bail.
ls that what you want?

30:39.320 --> 30:41.311
All right, l'll tell you what.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.277
lf l'm staking this race,

30:44.440 --> 30:46.032
l'm driving it.

30:47.640 --> 30:51.599
The ride's not for sale, man.
l told you, nobody drives my car.

30:51.760 --> 30:52.875
All right,

30:53.040 --> 30:54.951
but l have all night.

30:57.680 --> 30:59.511
Look, man, l can beat him.
You can't.

30:59.680 --> 31:02.478
Yeah, but will you?
That's the question.

31:03.480 --> 31:04.595
You don't trust me?

31:04.760 --> 31:06.113
We're back to that?

31:06.280 --> 31:07.918
You know, where's Walsh?

31:08.080 --> 31:10.719
He took one look at Padilla and split.

31:12.560 --> 31:14.994
You don't screw
with these guys, man.

31:15.160 --> 31:16.718
Don't set me up.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.950
How are we doing, children?

31:23.360 --> 31:24.793
We got a little problem here.

31:25.320 --> 31:27.151
You promised me a race.

31:27.320 --> 31:29.436
Now, whatever you have to do
with this clown

31:29.600 --> 31:32.239
to make it happen,
you make it happen.

31:36.280 --> 31:37.998
That was real smooth, man.

31:38.160 --> 31:39.991
Now he's pissed.

31:40.160 --> 31:41.673
Then let me drive.

31:43.600 --> 31:46.478
You're a one-man psycho ward,
you know that.

31:48.080 --> 31:49.274
Here.

31:49.440 --> 31:52.750
l'm trusting you, man.
And l don't trust anybody.

32:06.680 --> 32:08.238
Hey, is this seat taken?

32:08.400 --> 32:10.789
No. Please, join me.

32:10.960 --> 32:12.678
Thank you.

32:15.280 --> 32:18.397
You know, l could really use
some advice about me and David

32:18.560 --> 32:21.836
- and this whole radio show.
- Yeah.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.274
Well,

32:23.440 --> 32:26.432
see, l didn't think it would be fun,
but it really is.

32:26.600 --> 32:29.512
And l'm doing great.
At least, l think l'm doing great.

32:30.040 --> 32:31.758
And David does too.

32:31.920 --> 32:35.629
l think he does. Even though you can't
tell by the way he's been acting.

32:35.800 --> 32:37.028
But--

32:38.000 --> 32:39.433
Dylan?

32:40.680 --> 32:42.636
- You're not even listening to me.
- What?

32:44.000 --> 32:45.479
You know now l can understand

32:45.640 --> 32:47.915
why Kelly and Brenda
get so frustrated with you.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.719
Sorry, Donna,
l just got a little distracted.

32:51.320 --> 32:52.833
What is it?

32:55.920 --> 32:58.912
Dylan, l asked if l could join you
and you said yes, if you didn't mean it--

32:59.080 --> 33:00.877
lt's Brandon and Steve, all right?

33:01.040 --> 33:03.952
l'm a little worried. They went
to this street race with this punk

33:04.400 --> 33:06.960
and l'm afraid they're gonna get taken.
Or beaten up.

33:07.120 --> 33:09.236
Or worse.

33:09.400 --> 33:11.152
What are you doing here, then?

33:22.840 --> 33:24.239
Cool?

33:26.800 --> 33:29.030
All right, Sanders.
Look, we've got better rubber than him.

33:29.200 --> 33:31.475
But he's got us on inches.
You gotta beat him off the line.

33:31.640 --> 33:32.993
Now, l'll be starting the race.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.720
So when l point to you,
you bring up the revs up to here.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.553
Now look, when l bring my hand down,
you hammer that gas,

33:38.720 --> 33:39.914
but don't you look back, okay?

33:40.080 --> 33:41.559
Good luck. He'll be calling the race.

34:02.480 --> 34:04.835
- What? What now?
- What is this?

34:05.000 --> 34:06.956
What's with the stalling,
chicken man?

34:07.120 --> 34:08.871
What's with your girlfriend
calling the race?

34:09.040 --> 34:11.918
Hey, look, man, l've had it with you.
Obviously, you don't wanna race.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.150
Then how about this: you and me.

34:14.320 --> 34:18.393
No stalling, no crap, no talk,
no nothing. Just you and me.

34:18.560 --> 34:22.155
Your car there. My car there.
We drive straight at each other.

34:22.320 --> 34:24.594
The first one who swerves
is a chicken.

34:25.840 --> 34:27.989
You think you got the guts for that?

34:30.440 --> 34:32.112
Then Colonel Sanders
the chicken man,

34:32.280 --> 34:34.998
you don't say another word.

34:36.239 --> 34:39.755
Hope when l'm your age
l'm still living in the '50s.

34:40.719 --> 34:43.280
Where did you get your car?
From your mommy, big shot, huh?

34:43.440 --> 34:45.271
l bet you get your money
from her too.

34:45.440 --> 34:47.112
You know, how she gets it,
don't you?

34:47.280 --> 34:49.396
- Don't you?
- Not by stealing races.

34:49.560 --> 34:51.994
No, no, no, she is too old for that.

34:52.159 --> 34:55.947
l mean, how many slimy producers
did mommy dearest do

34:56.120 --> 34:58.634
for little Stevie's wheels?

35:03.840 --> 35:07.879
Chicken. Chicken.
You and me, man. You and me.

35:09.800 --> 35:12.678
- Steve, what are you doing this for?
- Don't worry, l'm not using your car.

35:12.840 --> 35:15.229
- You got nothing to prove to this guy.
- Maybe l do, all right?

35:15.400 --> 35:17.197
Look, just get in your car
and drive away, man.

35:17.360 --> 35:19.237
So Padilla and you can take
cheap shots at my mom,

35:19.400 --> 35:21.356
- who's protected me all my life.
- Look, we all--

35:21.520 --> 35:23.078
No. We don't ''all'' anything, all right?

35:23.240 --> 35:24.229
She adopted me.

35:24.400 --> 35:26.755
She loved me when no one else
on this entire planet did.

35:39.640 --> 35:42.632
l can't believe the rich girl from Beverly
Hills was such a dead-bang shot.

35:42.800 --> 35:46.759
Well, l can't believe the little girl from
Minnesota held her own in the big city.

35:46.920 --> 35:50.071
Now, tell me again,
how did we get here?

35:50.240 --> 35:53.198
lt's hazy, but l think
we can trace it back to your mother.

35:53.360 --> 35:55.316
And from there, back to Dylan.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.750
l said the D word.

35:59.800 --> 36:01.313
l think we made
a big mistake, Brenda.

36:01.480 --> 36:03.072
What?

36:03.920 --> 36:05.114
Giving Dylan the power to choose

36:05.280 --> 36:07.430
which one of us
he wants to go out with?

36:08.040 --> 36:09.678
Or going on this blind double date?

36:11.040 --> 36:12.519
What if we both lose him?

36:14.800 --> 36:17.030
Well, l'm sure we can always get
pip-squeak and pip-squeak

36:17.200 --> 36:18.713
to take us here every Friday night.

36:18.880 --> 36:21.519
Yes, but we have to promise
not to let these guys come between us.

36:22.280 --> 36:23.918
Never let any guy come between us.

36:26.480 --> 36:29.233
By the way, l think Adam likes you.

36:31.600 --> 36:33.556
- Here you go, ladies.
- l'll bet you're starved.

36:33.720 --> 36:35.073
All right, chilli-cheese nachos.

36:35.240 --> 36:36.229
Those are mine.

36:36.400 --> 36:37.549
Thank you.

36:37.720 --> 36:42.396
And cheese-steak sandwich,
chilli fries, chilli-Frito burrito

36:42.560 --> 36:45.028
- and two mineral waters.
- Those would be ours.

36:45.200 --> 36:46.952
l guess you guys
aren't very hungry, huh?

36:47.480 --> 36:49.914
Hey, yeah, you know
we were wondering something.

36:50.080 --> 36:51.399
Go ahead, ask them.

36:51.840 --> 36:52.989
- Me?
- Yeah.

36:53.160 --> 36:54.673
Fire away. We can handle it.

36:55.920 --> 36:57.831
Well, we were just wondering
why two girls

36:58.000 --> 37:01.117
as cool as yourselves
don't have boyfriends?

38:01.480 --> 38:03.471
What are you doing?

38:03.760 --> 38:06.115
- Who is that? McKay? ls that you?
- Yeah, it's me.

38:06.280 --> 38:08.396
- lt is none of your business.
- l think it is.

38:08.560 --> 38:10.278
- Hey, just butt out.
- lt's over, man.

38:10.440 --> 38:13.591
Why is it over? Because the prince
of Bel Air says it's over?

38:13.760 --> 38:15.716
Yeah, because l said so.

38:20.200 --> 38:21.872
You set me up, you crud.

38:28.080 --> 38:29.832
l heard there was a big race, man,
am l late?

38:31.000 --> 38:32.558
Dylan.

38:32.720 --> 38:37.157
Hey, man, l know.
l know, buddy, it's all right.

38:45.360 --> 38:46.839
All right, guys?

38:51.080 --> 38:53.150
Are you sure that's the guy?

38:54.120 --> 38:56.509
l've never been more sure
of anything in my whole life.

39:10.120 --> 39:12.554
Whatever this
mysterious adventure was,

39:12.720 --> 39:14.358
it sure seems
to work up the appetite.

39:14.520 --> 39:15.635
You should do this every day.

39:15.800 --> 39:18.189
Well, l can only speak for myself,
but as far as l'm concerned,

39:18.360 --> 39:20.794
no, no, thank you, absolutely not.

39:20.960 --> 39:22.279
- Steve, l'm shocked.
- So am l.

39:22.440 --> 39:24.715
- Where's your sense of adventure?
- Exactly.

39:24.880 --> 39:27.075
l wish you guys
could have seen the cops' faces

39:27.240 --> 39:29.117
when l mentioned
the name Frank Padilla.

39:29.280 --> 39:31.111
Not big fans of his early work.

39:31.280 --> 39:33.191
l was thrilled to see them
haul him off to jail.

39:33.800 --> 39:35.438
You think you were thrilled, huh?

39:35.600 --> 39:37.318
- Did they read him his rights?
- Andrea--

39:37.480 --> 39:40.119
l wanna make sure
it was a hundred percent by the book.

39:40.280 --> 39:42.430
l wanna nail that guy.

39:43.320 --> 39:45.515
Yeah, you guys are all pretty lucky
to have each other.

39:47.640 --> 39:48.914
Yeah, we are.

39:56.720 --> 39:57.755
Wayne, Adam.

39:57.920 --> 40:00.309
Brandon, Dylan,
Andrea, Steve and...

40:00.480 --> 40:02.516
- Joe.
- Joe.

40:02.680 --> 40:04.875
- Hi.
- Hey.

40:05.040 --> 40:08.271
So you guys are the double date
from Princeton, right?

40:08.680 --> 40:10.033
You must be child prodigies?

40:10.840 --> 40:14.150
- The Princeton School.
- ''Making boys into men.''

40:19.080 --> 40:20.718
So, boys--

40:20.880 --> 40:22.359
Guys,

40:22.520 --> 40:25.637
how did the date go?

40:27.520 --> 40:30.353
Well, Brenda is remarkable.

40:30.520 --> 40:32.033
Oh, yeah.

40:32.200 --> 40:34.714
And Kelly, Kelly's a goddess.

40:38.640 --> 40:41.154
Yup, l know what you mean.

40:44.280 --> 40:45.679
<i>Yo, yo, West</i> B <i>everly,</i>

40:45.840 --> 40:46.955
This is Donna-Donna

40:47.120 --> 40:49.509
pumping ten trillion watts
of Mondo Music madness.

40:50.280 --> 40:51.918
<i>l always wanted to do that</i>
<i>on the air,</i>

40:52.320 --> 40:54.834
And now that l have,

40:57.040 --> 40:59.474
l guess what l'm trying to say is

40:59.640 --> 41:01.631
it's been fun.

41:01.800 --> 41:04.268
But l'm sure
you've all missed David.

41:05.120 --> 41:07.315
You have no idea how much l have.

41:11.320 --> 41:14.676
Anyway, this might be slow
for first thing Monday morning,

41:14.840 --> 41:16.273
but first things first.

41:16.440 --> 41:18.476
Anyway, l chose it.

41:23.160 --> 41:24.912
lt's all yours again.

41:27.120 --> 41:29.156
Look, Donna, l got a lot of work
done over the weekend

41:29.320 --> 41:31.709
and l kind of got my head
cleared up.

41:31.880 --> 41:34.075
And l really don't want
you to give it up.

41:35.280 --> 41:36.759
David, l tried.

41:36.920 --> 41:38.638
l mean, l really, really tried.

41:38.800 --> 41:40.199
And you were totally great.

41:40.360 --> 41:41.713
And l'm totally not.

41:43.320 --> 41:45.038
You know
l only wanted to help you.

41:45.200 --> 41:46.633
l know. And you did.

41:47.920 --> 41:48.989
l knew you could do the show

41:49.160 --> 41:51.435
but it's like you swept in here
and you became two people.

41:53.120 --> 41:54.519
Thanks.

41:54.680 --> 41:56.398
l think.

41:56.560 --> 41:58.551
So, what do you say?

41:58.720 --> 42:00.870
Maybe we become one
of those drive-time teams, you know,

42:01.040 --> 42:02.075
Mark and Brian.

42:02.240 --> 42:04.117
Donna and David
coming at you, going strong.

42:04.760 --> 42:06.113
Okay,

42:06.280 --> 42:07.713
except one thing.

42:07.880 --> 42:10.872
David and Donna,
coming at you, going strong.

42:11.880 --> 42:14.474
<i>Well, here we are, West</i> B <i>everly,</i>
<i>David and Donna,</i>
