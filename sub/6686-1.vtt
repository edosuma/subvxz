DAYBREAKERS

02:44.030 --> 03:00.663
Transcribed by: Anreith, NightCrawler
Synced by: Don4EveR

03:32.969 --> 03:34.599
Let's be clear
about this.

03:34.600 --> 03:36.403
<i>Humans were offered
a chance to assimilate</i>

03:36.404 --> 03:38.237
<i>but they refused.</i>

03:38.238 --> 03:40.473
<i>Therefore, they are enemies
of the state and will be</i>

03:40.474 --> 03:42.995
<i>captured and farmed for
blood supply.</i>

03:46.408 --> 03:49.119
<i>It's a disgrace that we
have reduced human</i>

03:49.120 --> 03:51.160
<i>beings to mere vessels
for blood supply.</i>

03:51.161 --> 03:53.516
<i>We should be focusing on
finding a blood substitute...</i>

03:53.517 --> 03:57.687
<i>We always come back to
the magic potion solution.</i>

03:57.688 --> 03:58.967
<i>Where is it?</i>

03:58.968 --> 04:01.057
"Starving. Need blood"

05:18.169 --> 05:21.137
<i>With little or no population
remaining to sustain industry</i>

05:21.138 --> 05:24.705
<i>other Third World countries
throughout Asia have also...</i>

05:38.163 --> 05:40.285
"Serving 20% blood"

07:00.588 --> 07:03.404
CHIEF HEMATOLOGIST
EDWARD DALTON - APPROVED

08:11.215 --> 08:14.415
All the material in this
meeting is classified

08:14.416 --> 08:15.716
Commissioner?

08:16.372 --> 08:20.719
Death row inmate 4705-B
was a vampire selected

08:20.721 --> 08:22.859
for a month long study
on the effects of

08:22.860 --> 08:24.176
blood deprivation.

08:24.410 --> 08:25.373
What?

08:25.374 --> 08:28.239
A complete lack of human
blood over this period

08:28.240 --> 08:30.461
resulted in a massive
deterioration of the

08:30.462 --> 08:32.035
frontal lobe.

08:32.543 --> 08:35.078
First signs of physical
deformities began with

08:35.078 --> 08:38.797
elongated ears. Mental
functions such as logic,

08:38.798 --> 08:41.900
emotion, most parts of
speech then terminated

08:41.902 --> 08:43.894
much faster than you or
your team originally

08:43.895 --> 08:45.714
speculated, Dr. Dalton.

08:45.715 --> 08:48.824
Out on the streets these
creatures, these subsiders,

08:48.825 --> 08:51.083
are becoming a real problem.

08:51.084 --> 08:52.800
Gentlemen, we are starving.

08:52.801 --> 08:56.051
Our latest statistics show
that less than 5% of the

08:56.052 --> 08:57.661
human population remains.

08:57.662 --> 09:00.427
What we're talking
about is the extinction

09:00.428 --> 09:01.677
of the human race.

09:01.678 --> 09:04.414
What we're talking about
is only having enough blood

09:04.415 --> 09:07.402
to sustain our population
until the end of the month.

09:07.404 --> 09:10.262
If a blood substitute
is not found immediately

09:10.263 --> 09:13.406
this will happen to all of us.

09:15.594 --> 09:17.203
Edward?

09:26.973 --> 09:29.242
Enjoy your coffee, Sir.

09:31.599 --> 09:36.155
Did I ever tell you about
my daughter Alison?

09:36.156 --> 09:40.229
In early 2008 I was
diagnosed with Sarcoma.

09:40.230 --> 09:42.616
The shock of finding out
I had cancer was one thing,

09:42.617 --> 09:45.073
but having to tell
my daughter...

09:45.323 --> 09:47.449
She was devastated.

09:47.450 --> 09:52.756
I prayed for a miracle,
but was realistic.

09:54.485 --> 09:56.345
And then the
world changed.

09:56.848 --> 09:58.913
My prayers were answered.

09:58.914 --> 10:02.276
Immortality gave
me my cure.

10:02.277 --> 10:06.650
My daughter and I now
had all the time in the world.

10:06.651 --> 10:12.047
But she saw this
evolution as a disease,

10:12.048 --> 10:14.131
worse than any cancer.

10:14.133 --> 10:16.766
She refused to turn.

10:17.863 --> 10:20.525
I was a monster to her.

10:24.095 --> 10:27.576
She ran, like so many did.

10:27.577 --> 10:30.286
No, we are blessed, Edward.

10:30.287 --> 10:32.246
Blessed.

10:32.247 --> 10:34.142
And you have to stare
death in the face

10:34.143 --> 10:36.530
to truly know that.

10:37.517 --> 10:40.178
We are not ready
yet, Mr. Bromley.

10:43.754 --> 10:46.279
Not a coffee drinker?

10:47.218 --> 10:48.843
Not really.

10:51.723 --> 10:55.098
You pity the humans,
don't you?

10:56.528 --> 10:58.613
Well, me too.

10:58.614 --> 11:00.214
Me too.

11:01.664 --> 11:05.310
These are desperate
times, Edward.

11:05.785 --> 11:09.895
We must start testing
the blood substitute.

11:09.896 --> 11:16.278
It is the only way to
help the human race.

11:17.805 --> 11:20.272
He wants us to move
ahead again, doesn't he?

11:20.273 --> 11:21.273
Yeah.

11:23.177 --> 11:24.177
Okay.

11:27.033 --> 11:29.779
Is there any change?

11:29.780 --> 11:34.101
Hembicillin CBC and a
biochemical panel.

11:34.102 --> 11:36.338
All stable.

11:37.177 --> 11:39.776
The substitute is working.

11:41.016 --> 11:44.081
It's time to move
beyond animal testing.

11:44.452 --> 11:47.053
You know the Vernon
Park Cemetery was

11:47.055 --> 11:50.364
raided by a bunch
of kids last night.

11:50.805 --> 11:52.564
They dug up a dozen
graves thinking

11:52.565 --> 11:54.424
they'd find some
human blood.

11:56.561 --> 11:59.061
It's nuts out there.

12:13.257 --> 12:16.107
Now private, you may
feel a slight increase

12:16.108 --> 12:18.419
in body temperature.
That's just the Hembicillin

12:18.420 --> 12:20.752
entering your system,
it's to be expected.

12:20.753 --> 12:21.553
Yes, Sir.

12:31.533 --> 12:34.893
- How do you feel?
- No change, Sir.

12:51.275 --> 12:53.497
6 degree increase.

12:53.498 --> 12:56.721
Slightly more accelerated
than anticipated but...

12:56.723 --> 12:58.123
you're fine.

13:10.094 --> 13:13.563
68 degrees and holding.

13:16.315 --> 13:17.313
Okay.

13:19.349 --> 13:22.252
- Okay, how do you feel?
- I feel fine, Si...

13:24.291 --> 13:25.824
Shit!

13:27.919 --> 13:29.868
20 cc of Epimone!
Come on!

14:32.548 --> 14:34.661
<i>Violent scenes in London

15:02.898 --> 15:04.325
Oh, shit!

15:19.664 --> 15:21.001
Fuck.

15:32.123 --> 15:33.502
You alright?

15:34.970 --> 15:37.266
- What are you doing?
- Get back!

15:37.267 --> 15:39.586
- Don't come any closer!
- Shoot him again!

15:39.587 --> 15:40.987
Don't!

15:43.715 --> 15:45.722
- You're human.
- Shoot!

15:45.723 --> 15:47.123
Don't shoot me again!

15:52.717 --> 15:56.566
Listen, I can help you.
Come on! Get in my car.

15:56.567 --> 15:58.885
I'll help you! Come on!
Let me help you!

15:58.887 --> 16:00.187
Get in my car!

16:01.576 --> 16:03.663
Come on. Come on!

16:07.596 --> 16:08.900
Come on, get in.

16:10.584 --> 16:12.161
It's alright.

16:49.317 --> 16:52.680
- You okay, Sir?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

16:52.681 --> 16:54.796
Did you get a good
look at them, Sir?

16:54.797 --> 16:58.914
No, not really.
It happened so fast.

16:58.915 --> 17:01.233
They didn't wait around
to see how I was.

17:01.234 --> 17:02.731
We believe they
may be humans, Sir.

17:02.732 --> 17:04.648
Did you see where
they went?

17:07.665 --> 17:09.868
I think they went that way.

17:13.748 --> 17:15.737
You take care, Sir.

17:30.686 --> 17:32.024
Thank you.

17:32.025 --> 17:34.366
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

17:35.751 --> 17:37.837
See you around.

17:38.555 --> 17:40.359
Somehow I doubt that.

17:40.360 --> 17:42.565

18:57.719 --> 18:59.099
Hey, Ed.

19:00.838 --> 19:02.550
I hardly recognized you.

19:02.551 --> 19:04.260
It's only been a few months.

19:05.280 --> 19:06.885
I got something for you.

19:07.245 --> 19:08.624
What's this?

19:08.665 --> 19:10.234
What the fuck do
you think it is?

19:13.298 --> 19:15.254
Some birthday party, bro.

19:15.426 --> 19:18.006
Yeah. Well, I've turned
thirty-five ten times.

19:18.752 --> 19:20.268
Birthdays are pointless.

19:20.458 --> 19:21.785
Bullshit!

19:21.828 --> 19:23.149
Let's have a drink.

19:29.309 --> 19:30.712
It smells human.

19:30.906 --> 19:32.086
100% pure.

19:32.894 --> 19:35.684
That's one of the perks
of serving your country.

19:36.725 --> 19:38.488
I hear even that
pig shit you drink

19:38.489 --> 19:40.539
is getting hard to find.

19:44.144 --> 19:45.538
I can't.

19:45.732 --> 19:47.157
Fuck that.

19:47.197 --> 19:48.637
You need it.

19:48.676 --> 19:50.052
Yeah, well...

19:50.375 --> 19:51.915
Life is a bitch and...

19:52.401 --> 19:53.941
then you don't die.

19:54.824 --> 19:56.136
Come on.

19:57.211 --> 19:59.277
I don't touch human blood.

20:00.431 --> 20:02.837
You don't touch human blood.

20:02.838 --> 20:06.117
You work for a company that
uses humans like fuckin' cattle.

20:06.118 --> 20:07.916
Don't tell me how to live
my life, little brother.

20:07.941 --> 20:10.353
Then don't act all high
and mighty, big brother.

20:10.508 --> 20:12.564
Look Ed, your company
working on some type of

20:12.565 --> 20:15.054
fake blood, that's one thing,
but we all know that

20:15.055 --> 20:16.732
their money comes from
farming humans.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.592
Are we going to pick up from
exactly where we left off?

20:19.593 --> 20:22.989
I don't hunt humans.
That is your job.

20:22.990 --> 20:24.650
I find them. You farm them.

20:25.159 --> 20:26.682
All right. Well...

20:26.683 --> 20:29.525
- Let's just dump this shit.
- Nothing changes, does it?

20:29.526 --> 20:30.740
Does it?

20:30.941 --> 20:33.001
You still don't get
why I joined.

20:33.740 --> 20:35.151
What happens...

20:35.773 --> 20:39.134
when there isn't
a single drop left?

20:39.135 --> 20:41.119
When there isn't
a single human?

20:41.120 --> 20:43.579
-A single anything?
-We will always find more.

20:43.580 --> 20:46.651
A blood substitute means
the end of human hunting.

20:46.652 --> 20:49.231
Fake blood. Doesn't
mean the end of shit.

20:49.378 --> 20:51.705
Well, if I believed that,
let me drive a stake

20:51.706 --> 20:53.606
through my heart
right now.

21:04.848 --> 21:06.163
Shit!

21:26.653 --> 21:28.136
Frankie. Frankie.

21:37.010 --> 21:38.325
Shit!

21:38.758 --> 21:40.098
Oh, my God!

21:54.445 --> 21:55.746

22:06.793 --> 22:08.109
Frankie.

22:12.054 --> 22:13.370
Frankie.

23:07.678 --> 23:10.726
This is the third home invasion
in this area in the last month.

23:10.851 --> 23:13.081
These things are
in the suburbs now.

23:13.089 --> 23:14.425
So...

23:14.468 --> 23:16.195
it's important that you
update your security.

23:21.293 --> 23:24.097
Subsiders. Strong bastards.

23:24.098 --> 23:26.016
The same common traits
as all the others.

23:26.036 --> 23:27.746
The aggression is most
likely brought on by

23:27.774 --> 23:29.679
massive reductions
in Serotonin levels.

23:29.699 --> 23:32.496
We need more patrols
ashing these filthy rats.

23:45.403 --> 23:46.795
Carl?

23:46.989 --> 23:48.409
What? You knew him?

23:51.291 --> 23:54.307
Yeah, he was the
local gardener.

23:54.772 --> 23:56.457
I saw him two weeks ago.

23:57.021 --> 23:58.818
He's feeding off
other vamps.

23:58.985 --> 24:01.079
Only takes a couple of weeks
to get this messed up.

24:01.662 --> 24:03.802
Some of these wounds
look self inflected.

24:04.369 --> 24:06.130
He fed on himself?

24:06.341 --> 24:07.704
Perhaps.

24:07.746 --> 24:10.230
And that would speed up
mutation considerably.

to finish me off?

25:12.264 --> 25:13.921
We need your help.

25:14.467 --> 25:17.629
We've been searching for
vampires we can trust.

25:18.734 --> 25:20.093
Trust?

25:27.125 --> 25:30.198
You're a blood doctor.
You can help us.

25:31.003 --> 25:32.399
Help you how?

25:32.440 --> 25:36.170
A blood substitute is a
solution but not a cure.

25:36.171 --> 25:37.511
There's another way.

25:40.550 --> 25:41.654
Take it.

26:01.695 --> 26:04.155
"GORDON CREEK. NOON
WEDNESDAY. ALONE."

26:25.515 --> 26:26.810
Who was that?

26:27.379 --> 26:28.610
It's nothing.

26:37.191 --> 26:39.658
<i>With blood supplies
continuing to dwindle</i>

26:39.660 --> 26:41.862
<i>private investors are pulling
their human stock from the</i>

26:41.871 --> 26:44.093
<i>Bromley Marks harvesting facility.</i>

26:44.254 --> 26:46.546
<i>Many experts believe that
the company will no longer</i>

26:46.547 --> 26:48.664
<i>be able to handle the
national blood demand.</i>

26:48.676 --> 26:51.030
<i>The FDA spokesperson
confirmed yesterday...</i>

26:54.021 --> 26:55.962
How are you feeling, Edward?

26:56.223 --> 26:59.492
The break-in must have
been very traumatic.

26:59.493 --> 27:01.687
I'm fine. Thank you.

27:04.433 --> 27:07.147
Now, these attacks on
everyday citizens are

27:07.148 --> 27:09.486
cause for great concern.

27:10.994 --> 27:14.127
All the more reason to push
forward, wouldn't you say?

27:15.076 --> 27:17.129
I'd just like your guarantee

27:17.572 --> 27:22.064
that a substitute would replace
our need for a human supply, Sir.

27:23.044 --> 27:25.820
Well, it's important
that we allow

27:25.822 --> 27:28.481
the human race
time to repopulate.

27:29.500 --> 27:32.162
That's not exactly
what I asked.

27:33.395 --> 27:35.144
The majority of the
population will be

27:35.145 --> 27:38.028
content with a blood
substitute, yes.

27:38.029 --> 27:40.409
But there will always be
those who are willing to pay

27:40.564 --> 27:43.125
a little extra for the real thing.

27:46.698 --> 27:50.505
Come on, Edward.
We have to be realistic.

27:50.507 --> 27:53.289
If we don't cater
to all markets,

27:53.290 --> 27:54.990
someone else will.

27:55.997 --> 27:57.383
How much do you
think they'd be

27:57.384 --> 27:59.597
willing to pay for
your daughter?

29:19.202 --> 29:21.022
He's waiting for you.

29:52.069 --> 30:08.554
<i>UV Warning.</i>

30:30.694 --> 30:33.822
Trees are the oldest
living things on earth.

30:35.601 --> 30:37.101
Did you know that?

30:39.709 --> 30:44.057
They say, some are over
four thousand years old.

30:45.357 --> 30:47.047
Someday, though...

30:47.304 --> 30:48.976
this tree will die.

30:50.077 --> 30:51.970
And so will you.

30:53.452 --> 30:56.564
Maybe you won't die
of old age like her.

30:57.917 --> 31:00.516
But the thing
you're holding on to,

31:00.894 --> 31:03.697
that last breath
of humanity,

31:04.447 --> 31:07.187
will vanish as soon as
the blood does.

31:08.914 --> 31:10.522
What do you want?

31:10.708 --> 31:12.466
Same thing you do.

31:13.351 --> 31:14.778
A future.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.266
I was like you once.

31:33.811 --> 31:35.656
But not no more.

31:39.805 --> 31:41.618
Lionel Cormac.

31:42.004 --> 31:44.120
My friends call me Elvis.

31:47.848 --> 31:50.389
I ain't gonna bite.

31:55.560 --> 31:59.588
- Elvis?
- Yeah, you know like...

31:59.589 --> 32:03.576
<i>Lord almighty, I feel
my temperature rising.</i>

32:03.578 --> 32:09.810
<i>Higher higher. It's burning
through to my soul.</i>

32:14.665 --> 32:16.265
Feel that?

32:16.266 --> 32:19.411
Hadn't been beating
for nine years.

32:20.394 --> 32:22.994
Seems impossible,
don't it?

32:24.202 --> 32:25.629
It is impossible.

32:25.630 --> 32:28.339
So is walking around
without a pulse.

32:29.016 --> 32:31.300
But here you are.

32:31.301 --> 32:33.147
How did you do it?

32:37.348 --> 32:38.584
Audrey?

32:49.024 --> 32:52.008
- Put the gun down.
- Frankie?

32:52.009 --> 32:54.517
- Put the gun down!
- Frankie, what the...

32:54.518 --> 32:55.531
What the hell
are you doing?

32:55.532 --> 32:57.138
- Move away from him.
- Put the gun down!

32:57.139 --> 32:58.357
Don't make things worse.

32:58.358 --> 32:59.501
- Stop pointing the gun!
- Move away from them!

32:59.502 --> 33:00.968
- Frankie!
- This is serious shit, Ed.

33:00.969 --> 33:03.132
They can put you away
for a long time.

33:11.961 --> 33:13.102
Let's go.

33:20.183 --> 33:22.025
Motherfuckers!

33:25.201 --> 33:26.940
Come on, get
in my car!

33:48.603 --> 33:49.609
Shit!

33:55.520 --> 33:56.520
<i>UV warning.</i>

33:57.149 --> 33:58.149
Got it!

34:09.123 --> 34:11.047
"SIGNAL LOST"
- I can't...!

34:11.049 --> 34:12.049
Move!

34:58.527 --> 35:00.539
Hang on.

35:23.613 --> 35:25.728
Everybody okay?

35:25.729 --> 35:26.429
Yeah.

35:49.460 --> 35:51.725
Motherfuckers.

35:52.592 --> 35:55.040
I loved that car.

36:40.457 --> 36:42.740
You did the right thing.

36:42.741 --> 36:45.266
That was my brother.

36:53.157 --> 36:54.157
Come on.

37:07.618 --> 37:10.876
Never been good
at science, Doc.

37:10.877 --> 37:13.294
Cars have always
been my thing.

37:13.295 --> 37:17.123
Daylight modifications
are my specialty.

37:17.124 --> 37:19.342
Or used to be.

37:20.038 --> 37:23.436
Custom cameras, sun
shields, that kind of thing.

37:25.275 --> 37:30.152
My garage was one of the
first in town to start doing them.

37:30.153 --> 37:33.034
I had a shop right
near your place.

37:33.874 --> 37:37.614
Day time drivin' man,
nothin' beats it.

37:37.615 --> 37:42.615
No traffic, no cops.
But if you ain't careful

37:42.616 --> 37:47.244
you can get yourself
one hell of a sunburn.

37:57.584 --> 38:00.080
You can only go on
so long without blood

38:00.081 --> 38:02.286
before it messes
with your head.

38:22.075 --> 38:25.951
It's amazing how quickly
your whole world can change.

38:25.952 --> 38:27.852
Ain't it, Doc?

38:44.074 --> 38:47.108
We need to recreate
this. Safely.

38:47.109 --> 38:48.709
That's why we
need you.

38:51.916 --> 38:52.916
The Sun?

38:54.725 --> 38:57.807
You're human because
of the Sun?

38:58.114 --> 39:00.482
Hurt like hell.

39:17.112 --> 39:19.344
Please, have a seat.

39:22.522 --> 39:24.875
Do you know who I am?

39:24.876 --> 39:27.649
My brother's mentioned
you before, Sir.

39:30.502 --> 39:34.030
You did the right thing
reporting his actions.

39:34.559 --> 39:36.754
You want to continue
to do the right thing,

39:36.755 --> 39:38.420
don't you son?

39:38.422 --> 39:41.448
I will do whatever
is asked of me, Sir.

39:43.245 --> 39:46.888
Edward is a valuable
member of our team,

39:46.889 --> 39:50.619
and an essential part
of all our futures.

39:50.620 --> 39:54.180
All we wish, is for him to
continue with his work.

39:54.181 --> 39:59.317
If he returns immediately,
no formal charges will be laid.

39:59.318 --> 40:02.237
I don't know what you
think I can do, Sir.

40:05.534 --> 40:08.201
Do you like being
a vampire, son?

40:09.056 --> 40:10.056
Yes, Sir.

40:10.684 --> 40:12.084
Why?

40:12.952 --> 40:17.095
I mean, your brother
clearly disapproves.

40:17.096 --> 40:20.746
I wonder if it's a common
trait in your family.

40:22.084 --> 40:24.384
I'm good at this.

40:24.386 --> 40:28.167
I was never very good
at being human, Sir.

40:28.401 --> 40:31.097
And I'm not
my brother.

40:31.310 --> 40:33.310
Well...

40:34.777 --> 40:39.873
Good. Frankie.

40:42.655 --> 40:44.758
Every couple of
weeks we head out,

40:44.759 --> 40:47.313
to search for others.

40:47.799 --> 40:51.042
It's getting harder and
harder to find anybody.

40:51.043 --> 40:53.225
I only managed to
pick up three,

40:53.226 --> 40:56.471
when you drove us
off the road.

40:57.519 --> 40:59.238
Stop the car!

41:04.123 --> 41:07.046
When was the last time
you drank human blood?

41:07.047 --> 41:08.880
What's the matter?

41:12.153 --> 41:14.094
I'm fine.

41:16.421 --> 41:20.149
Oh. You... don't...

41:24.901 --> 41:26.396
We need you focused.

41:26.397 --> 41:30.505
- No! No, I'm not...
- She ain't asking, Doc.

41:37.139 --> 41:39.445
Where we're going...

41:39.446 --> 41:41.991
I can't afford to
worry about you,

41:41.992 --> 41:43.988
around the others.

42:30.391 --> 42:32.528
Well it's about
god damn time.

42:32.529 --> 42:36.034
Stop worrying,
you'll live longer.

42:38.838 --> 42:42.428
Travis, this is Ed.

42:42.430 --> 42:43.363
Ed!

42:45.863 --> 42:47.797
Well ain't this nothing.

42:47.798 --> 42:49.676
Usually when there's
a vampire around,

42:49.677 --> 42:52.797
I'm the one
shitting my pants.

42:52.798 --> 42:54.996
You better be worth
the risk, man.

42:54.997 --> 42:56.642
Jar's made contact
with the largest

42:56.643 --> 43:00.028
human group we've
found in a long time.

43:00.029 --> 43:02.196
And he's going to
bring them back here.

43:02.943 --> 43:05.000
I set up more cots
in the cellar.

43:05.002 --> 43:08.512
We'll stay in radio contact
and keep you updated.

43:08.513 --> 43:10.115
Good luck.

43:12.081 --> 43:14.074
You too.

43:31.426 --> 43:33.659
Is this place safe?

43:33.660 --> 43:35.547
Being human in a
world full of vampires

43:35.548 --> 43:39.111
is about as safe as
bare backing a 5$ whore.

43:40.184 --> 43:44.822
This is home, Doc.
But none of us are safe.

43:48.182 --> 43:50.281
This vineyard belonged
to my parents.

43:50.283 --> 43:51.971
They always wanted me
to run it someday, but,

43:51.972 --> 43:55.183
at the time I was more
interested in college.

43:55.184 --> 43:59.794
Not long after the
outbreak I came back.

43:59.795 --> 44:02.701
It seemed like a
good place to hide.

44:09.145 --> 44:11.256
I owe that girl my life.

44:11.257 --> 44:13.053
She found me after I
was shaked-n-baked

44:13.055 --> 44:14.655
and brought me here.

44:18.016 --> 44:20.089
I want you to
meet someone.

44:21.811 --> 44:25.725
Ed, this is senator
Wes Turner.

44:25.726 --> 44:29.110
- Hey. You made it.
- Yeah. Barely.

44:29.111 --> 44:32.454
- More damn vampires.
- Back off, Colin.

44:32.455 --> 44:33.455
They're trying to help.

44:34.941 --> 44:36.489
Hey. Being a vampire
and a politician,

44:36.491 --> 44:38.711
it can be hard to
make friends.

44:39.334 --> 44:42.675
Wes knows enough vampires
in office that want this cure.

44:42.676 --> 44:46.247
And more importantly, will
use it for the right reasons.

44:46.248 --> 44:48.716
We want to rebuild
the human race.

44:48.717 --> 44:50.866
But a way back can be
a dangerous thing,

44:50.867 --> 44:52.090
in the wrong hands.

44:52.091 --> 44:54.852
We're an endangered
species, Doc.

44:54.853 --> 44:56.708
It's time we changed
all that.

45:22.927 --> 45:24.971
<i>The escalating global
blood crisis has seen</i>

45:24.972 --> 45:27.903
<i>prices skyrocket over
the past week.</i>

45:30.074 --> 45:31.559
<i>Experts believe that
this will make blood</i>

45:31.560 --> 45:33.875
<i>unobtainable to many citizens
across the country,</i>

45:33.876 --> 45:35.828
<i>and create what could
only be described</i>

45:35.829 --> 45:38.434
<i> as a subsider epidemic.</i>

45:44.508 --> 45:45.808
Excuse me.

45:47.821 --> 45:49.762
This is not what
I asked for.

45:49.763 --> 45:52.695
Read the sign, Sir. We're
now only permitted to

45:52.696 --> 45:54.748
serve 5% blood
with every coffee.

45:54.749 --> 45:58.211
I don't care what
the signs says.

46:00.512 --> 46:03.822
Just put some more fucking
blood in my coffee.

46:03.823 --> 46:05.123
I can't.

46:25.321 --> 46:26.489
Move!

46:49.884 --> 46:52.505
We've tested burning
extracted blood under UV light

46:52.650 --> 46:54.545
It always remains infected.

46:55.301 --> 46:57.520
How could yours
possibly be human?

46:57.528 --> 46:58.957
You tell me, Doc.

46:59.718 --> 47:02.803
What did it feel like when
the sun hit your body?

47:03.065 --> 47:05.330
What do you mean
what did it feel like?

47:05.336 --> 47:08.706
I felt like a god-damned
piece of fried chicken.

47:08.975 --> 47:10.617
Can you remember anything
specific about it?

47:10.618 --> 47:12.105
Anything at all.

47:12.106 --> 47:15.825
Well I remember when
the sunlight hit me.

47:16.140 --> 47:18.794
It was like a bolt
of lightning

47:18.795 --> 47:20.576
kick-started my heart.

47:22.103 --> 47:23.578
It was like...

47:23.616 --> 47:26.356
someone let the
air back in the room.

47:31.100 --> 47:33.368
Maybe the only way
to treat the blood

47:33.373 --> 47:35.424
is inside the body.

47:36.018 --> 47:38.805
We need to control
a daylight burn.

47:46.109 --> 47:48.768
- Pickup was successful.
- That's great Jarvis!

47:48.769 --> 47:50.349
Total count is 15.

47:50.535 --> 47:51.710
We'll stay clear of
the interstates,

47:51.711 --> 47:53.453
so it might take us
a while to get back.

47:53.454 --> 47:54.954
Be safe.

47:58.809 --> 48:00.081
You okay?

48:02.551 --> 48:04.513
They may be frightened
of you, but...

48:04.531 --> 48:06.697
none of them doubt
that you can help us.

48:07.700 --> 48:10.605
I can't even remember
what it's like to be human.

48:13.130 --> 48:14.983
Are you afraid to die?

48:16.599 --> 48:17.911
Yeah.

48:18.652 --> 48:20.564
Most of us are too
scared of death to

48:20.565 --> 48:22.363
think of it as
an option.

48:22.364 --> 48:24.850
I guess that's why
so many turned.

48:27.227 --> 48:29.080
How did it
happen to you?

48:30.473 --> 48:32.191
I was betrayed.

48:34.324 --> 48:35.914
My brother...

48:45.857 --> 48:47.210
What are these?

48:47.806 --> 48:49.612
Wine fermentation tanks.

48:49.930 --> 48:51.391
Fermentation.

48:51.429 --> 48:54.236
- That's airtight, right?
- Yeah, that's right.

49:00.447 --> 49:03.752
- What's that?
- It's an extraction fan.

49:03.753 --> 49:06.908
Pulls air out of the tank to
stop the wine from oxidizing.

49:06.909 --> 49:09.955
Okay, perfect. We use that
to put out the fire.

49:31.353 --> 49:33.794
How far is it to the
winery, Jarvis?

49:33.796 --> 49:35.636
It's about two
hours from here.

49:36.005 --> 49:37.959
So, have you been
doing this for long?

49:37.960 --> 49:40.172
Picking up humans,
giving them a home.

49:40.180 --> 49:41.871
Since the beginning.

49:42.426 --> 49:44.340
There's not many
of us left now.

49:44.892 --> 49:46.251
How long have you
been running?

49:46.252 --> 49:49.727
Most of us have been on
the run together for years.

49:50.918 --> 49:52.374
I've never seen
it this bad.

49:52.565 --> 49:54.873
What made you come
all the way out here?

49:54.989 --> 49:56.572
It's safer.

49:57.290 --> 50:00.631
There's lots of sun,
there's not a lot of shade.

50:00.982 --> 50:03.079
Not much food
either, hmm?

50:03.897 --> 50:06.477
Yeah. Thanks.

50:10.196 --> 50:11.507
Oh shit!

50:19.388 --> 50:20.714
Dammit!

50:46.233 --> 50:47.559
Shit!

50:48.799 --> 50:51.200
Tranq dart!
Move! Move!

51:17.107 --> 51:18.458
Oh shit!

51:20.652 --> 51:22.316
Move. Move!

51:22.925 --> 51:24.372
Go go go!

51:27.593 --> 51:28.917
Keep firing.

51:31.152 --> 51:32.627
Fire!

51:34.585 --> 51:35.895
Fire!

51:57.485 --> 51:58.878
Can anyone hear me?

51:59.979 --> 52:02.414
Hello? Is anyone there?

52:02.758 --> 52:04.558
We hear you,
who is this?

52:04.583 --> 52:06.923
They found us.
They're everywhere.

52:06.926 --> 52:08.300
Where are you?

52:15.084 --> 52:17.311
Got another.

52:18.334 --> 52:20.010
Are you still there?

52:31.463 --> 52:32.911
It's completely secluded.

52:32.950 --> 52:34.879
It should be the safest
place for us to regroup.

52:34.898 --> 52:36.179
How long will it
take to get there?

52:36.180 --> 52:37.603
If we stay off the main
highways and follow

52:37.605 --> 52:39.158
the trails along the
Marshall River

52:39.192 --> 52:41.095
we should reach my
cabin before nightfall.

52:41.116 --> 52:42.425
Okay.

52:42.469 --> 52:44.912
- You be careful.
- You too.

52:48.102 --> 52:50.731
Come on, Ed.
We gotta go.

52:50.903 --> 52:53.830
- I can't.
- They'll be here soon.

52:53.831 --> 52:56.494
The sun is about to come up,
we may never get a chance to

52:56.495 --> 52:58.803
set up this experiment
again, I've gotta do it.

52:58.808 --> 53:01.759
- That thing could kill you.
- I'm already dead.

53:05.541 --> 53:06.865
Fuck it.

53:08.297 --> 53:10.488
I do love a good BBQ.

53:45.074 --> 53:46.386
You don't need that.

53:47.205 --> 53:49.045
You're safe here,
I promise.

53:49.598 --> 53:51.218
Where are my friends?

53:53.093 --> 53:55.687
Don't hurt them.
Please!

53:57.903 --> 54:00.149
You look so beautiful.

54:00.544 --> 54:02.764
You've grown
up so much.

54:07.420 --> 54:08.920
Dad, please.

54:10.448 --> 54:12.436
I'm so happy to see you.

54:12.842 --> 54:15.263
I never thought I'd see
you again, sweetheart.

54:16.310 --> 54:18.339
You're safe now.

54:18.609 --> 54:20.177
You're safe.

54:21.363 --> 54:23.230
But your friends...

54:23.436 --> 54:25.871
There's nothing I
can do, I'm sorry.

54:27.643 --> 54:29.458
You're not sorry.

54:31.600 --> 54:33.913
Ally, let me help
you, please!

54:53.912 --> 54:56.036
Are you sure you're
ready to do this?

54:56.848 --> 54:59.649
Yeah. What could
go wrong?

55:11.341 --> 55:13.465
You feel so warm.

55:53.799 --> 55:55.287
Ready, Doc?

55:56.085 --> 55:58.222
- Ready.
- Let's do it, Aud.

55:58.748 --> 56:00.669
Okay, on my count.

56:00.731 --> 56:05.137
3-2-1-Now!

56:21.921 --> 56:23.233
Ed?

56:24.392 --> 56:25.759
I'm alright.

56:25.800 --> 56:27.553
He's okay, Aud.

56:27.581 --> 56:31.081
- Let's do it again.
- Again, let's do it again!

56:35.628 --> 56:39.307
3-2-1-Now!

56:53.680 --> 56:55.168
You okay?

56:55.901 --> 56:57.227
Ed?

56:57.271 --> 56:59.958
- Yeah. Again.
- He's fine!

57:07.601 --> 57:11.384
3-2-1-Now!

57:42.299 --> 57:43.625
Ed!

57:50.114 --> 57:51.534
Lord almighty.

58:20.512 --> 58:21.928
Mr. Dalton.

58:22.746 --> 58:24.195
How is the shoulder, son?

58:24.565 --> 58:27.514
It's healing quickly.
How about yourself, Sir?

58:27.953 --> 58:29.779
Oh, I'll survive.

58:31.685 --> 58:33.143
You know...

58:33.864 --> 58:37.816
During the civil war,
General Sherman said:

58:37.854 --> 58:40.221
"I'm tired and sick of war"

58:40.622 --> 58:43.055
"It's glory is all moonshine"

58:43.207 --> 58:45.167
"War is hell."

58:46.655 --> 58:50.551
Less than 50 humans have
been captured the last week.

58:50.863 --> 58:53.951
Some believe hell
may well be coming.

58:55.064 --> 58:57.432
With dedicated soldiers
like yourself,

58:57.792 --> 58:59.984
we can prevent that
from happening.

59:03.664 --> 59:05.221
Frankie...

59:09.323 --> 59:11.935
I need you to do
something for me.

59:20.140 --> 59:21.738
Get away from me!

59:21.770 --> 59:23.835
You don't need to
be scared of me.

59:23.849 --> 59:25.616
Stay away!

59:25.974 --> 59:27.381
Is this what you want?

59:27.865 --> 59:29.260
To live in fear?

59:29.983 --> 59:31.417
See, I can help you.

59:31.737 --> 59:33.279
Make you one of us.

59:33.314 --> 59:34.578
- Free.
- No

59:34.579 --> 59:35.718
You can live forever.

59:36.791 --> 59:38.123
Fuck you.

01:01:16.033 --> 01:01:17.467
Welcome back.

01:01:29.603 --> 01:01:31.743
"FROM THE ASHES SPRINGS NEW LIFE"

01:01:59.870 --> 01:02:01.770
She won't drink
her blood ration, Sir.

01:02:03.662 --> 01:02:04.975
Okay.

01:02:15.907 --> 01:02:17.243
Ally.

01:02:20.553 --> 01:02:21.865
Baby.

01:02:25.814 --> 01:02:29.264
Oh, Ally. What are you doing?
That'll poison you.

01:02:33.390 --> 01:02:35.311
Is this what you wanted?

01:02:35.662 --> 01:02:37.908
- Sweetheart, stop that.
- Is this what you wanted?

01:02:37.915 --> 01:02:39.222
No.

01:02:40.224 --> 01:02:41.536
No.

01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:44.509
You did this.

01:02:44.869 --> 01:02:46.668
- You did this.
- No.

01:02:49.153 --> 01:02:51.640
No. You did this.

01:03:12.378 --> 01:03:15.877
<i>Military forces have been ordered
to most major cities around the country</i>

01:03:15.878 --> 01:03:19.697
<i>in a bid to contain what is now being
described as the subsider epidemic.</i>

01:03:19.699 --> 01:03:22.427
<i>Military leaders have announced
they will take a strict</i>

01:03:22.428 --> 01:03:24.506
<i>no tolerance approach
to the crisis.</i>

01:03:24.520 --> 01:03:26.833
<i>An order to commence
the immediate round-up</i>

01:03:26.837 --> 01:03:29.980
<i>and capture of all Class 4
blood-deprived citizens</i>

01:03:29.981 --> 01:03:31.371
<i>has been issued.</i>

01:03:43.345 --> 01:03:44.457
Are we close?

01:03:44.509 --> 01:03:46.361
The Senator's cabin
should be just up ahead.

01:04:47.637 --> 01:04:49.206
It's all gone.

01:04:51.665 --> 01:04:53.085
Everything.

01:04:54.791 --> 01:04:57.292
We'll start again.

01:04:58.026 --> 01:05:00.001
We can't keep running.

01:05:03.229 --> 01:05:05.156
I know someone
who can help.

01:05:15.981 --> 01:05:18.610
<i>With the current military
round-up in full effect</i>

01:05:18.611 --> 01:05:20.408
<i>it's likely we will
continue to see</i>

01:05:20.432 --> 01:05:22.521
<i>a decreased subsider
presence on our streets.</i>

01:05:22.534 --> 01:05:24.531
<i>But the question has been
asked: "Now what?"</i>

01:05:24.548 --> 01:05:26.085
<i>Our families are starving.</i>

01:05:26.119 --> 01:05:28.395
<i>We can't afford to feed
these creatures, too.</i>

01:05:28.401 --> 01:05:31.260
<i>I know it might be
wrong but, these things,</i>

01:05:31.261 --> 01:05:33.005
<i>they've got to go.</i>

01:07:42.108 --> 01:07:43.848
<i>Die.</i>

01:07:44.029 --> 01:07:45.382
<i>Yeah.</i>

01:08:05.251 --> 01:08:06.567
Thank you.

01:08:07.240 --> 01:08:08.741
I know. I know.

01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:10.617
Well, I couldn't have
done it without you.

01:08:14.155 --> 01:08:15.549
Shit.

01:08:17.586 --> 01:08:19.140
I'll call you back.

01:08:23.068 --> 01:08:24.953
You're really human.

01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:30.023
-This is unbelievable.
- Hold it.

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:34.350
I'm sorry. Who are you?

01:08:34.707 --> 01:08:37.032
We're the folks with
the crossbows.

01:08:37.035 --> 01:08:38.966
It's a dangerous
time, Chris.

01:08:39.176 --> 01:08:42.367
We can´t be too careful.
Alright? Sit down, please.

01:08:45.337 --> 01:08:47.082
Ed, it's me.

01:08:47.618 --> 01:08:50.461
After the 6 years we've
spent working together.

01:08:50.462 --> 01:08:52.738
You know the sacrifices
I've made.

01:08:53.015 --> 01:08:55.692
I've been with you
100% of the way.

01:08:55.693 --> 01:08:57.189
- Always.
- I know.

01:08:58.276 --> 01:08:59.584
Alright, listen.

01:08:59.794 --> 01:09:03.582
We've got something better
than a blood substitute.

01:09:05.542 --> 01:09:07.179
We've got a cure.

01:09:07.478 --> 01:09:11.685
And I can repeat the procedure,
but I'm gonna need your help.

01:09:12.037 --> 01:09:15.350
This is a chance to
change everything.

01:09:26.432 --> 01:09:28.071
How did you do it?

01:09:41.515 --> 01:09:43.002
Are you gonna
answer that?

01:09:48.410 --> 01:09:49.723
Hello.

01:09:50.323 --> 01:09:51.685
No.

01:09:52.242 --> 01:09:53.555
Yeah.

01:09:55.007 --> 01:09:56.319
Hold on.

01:09:57.150 --> 01:09:58.760
Ex-wife.

01:09:58.792 --> 01:10:01.127
It's messy. Can you
give me a second?

01:10:02.295 --> 01:10:03.621
Yeah.

01:10:06.297 --> 01:10:09.206
<i>No. We didn't
agree on that, so...</i>

01:10:09.609 --> 01:10:10.921
<i>What are you
talking about?</i>

01:10:13.208 --> 01:10:14.796
<i>That's all?</i>

01:10:17.209 --> 01:10:19.791
<i>No. I don't remember
agreeing to this...</i>

01:10:20.872 --> 01:10:23.524
This is one fucking
ugly house.

01:10:31.320 --> 01:10:32.767
Where are you going?

01:10:33.242 --> 01:10:35.246
Check on your friend.

01:11:09.101 --> 01:11:10.413
Go.

01:11:11.154 --> 01:11:12.520
Go.

01:11:26.864 --> 01:11:29.110
If they find us,
we can't help her.

01:12:10.902 --> 01:12:12.286
Put it down.

01:12:17.217 --> 01:12:18.732
I don't believe it.

01:12:22.179 --> 01:12:23.855
Don't come any closer.

01:12:28.453 --> 01:12:31.440
Frankie, I found a cure.

01:12:31.571 --> 01:12:32.881
Alright?

01:12:33.167 --> 01:12:34.965
I can change you back.

01:12:37.055 --> 01:12:38.364
No.

01:12:38.408 --> 01:12:40.693
- Put it down, kid.
- No. It's alright.

01:12:40.861 --> 01:12:42.431
Frankie, it's alright.

01:12:43.291 --> 01:12:46.197
Frankie, it's not
too late.

01:12:47.748 --> 01:12:50.169
Do you know why
I turned you, Ed?

01:12:55.931 --> 01:12:58.145
You used to say to me
that you'd rather die

01:12:58.146 --> 01:13:00.506
than be like the
rest of us.

01:13:02.477 --> 01:13:05.650
I didn't turn you because
it was convenient, or

01:13:05.651 --> 01:13:08.568
because of some selfish
need for blood.

01:13:08.946 --> 01:13:11.178
I turned you because...

01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.970
you would've died
if I didn't.

01:13:15.589 --> 01:13:17.497
I couldn't lose you, Ed.

01:13:21.178 --> 01:13:23.110
I'm fucked up bad.

01:13:26.985 --> 01:13:28.897
I can get you
out of here.

01:13:29.071 --> 01:13:31.651
We're not going anywhere
without Audrey.

01:13:32.051 --> 01:13:34.959
- The woman?
- Yes, the woman.

01:13:36.178 --> 01:13:37.923
You'll never
get to her.

01:13:41.010 --> 01:13:42.637
You wanna help us?

01:13:45.248 --> 01:13:46.560
Please.

01:13:53.676 --> 01:13:54.988
Okay.

01:13:58.262 --> 01:13:59.588
Okay.

01:14:16.316 --> 01:14:17.710
God damn it.

01:15:18.647 --> 01:15:20.014
Edward.

01:15:20.884 --> 01:15:23.224
You've got a tan.
It suits you.

01:15:28.297 --> 01:15:29.742
You know, Edward.

01:15:30.891 --> 01:15:33.050
Her blood has a scent

01:15:33.061 --> 01:15:35.386
that no substitute
could ever replace.

01:15:37.566 --> 01:15:38.934
Fear.

01:15:48.572 --> 01:15:50.198
I don't wanna die.

01:15:53.489 --> 01:15:55.343
I can't do this...

01:15:55.815 --> 01:15:57.379
being human.

01:15:57.815 --> 01:15:59.506
Isn't that what you wanted?

01:15:59.535 --> 01:16:01.465
I don't wanna be afraid.

01:16:01.638 --> 01:16:05.006
I can never be free like
this, I see that now.

01:16:05.585 --> 01:16:06.897
Please.

01:16:07.832 --> 01:16:09.282
Help me.

01:16:11.236 --> 01:16:13.101
What is it that you want?

01:16:13.508 --> 01:16:15.159
Turn us both.

01:16:15.388 --> 01:16:16.781
Let us leave.

01:16:16.848 --> 01:16:20.835
And I'll show you a way to
repopulate your entire human supply.

01:16:20.837 --> 01:16:22.984
What the hell are you doing?

01:16:23.394 --> 01:16:25.753
And you would give
me this cure?

01:16:25.754 --> 01:16:27.158
Yes.

01:16:27.159 --> 01:16:29.486
As long as you allow
her to go free, too.

01:16:29.489 --> 01:16:30.809
No.

01:16:33.269 --> 01:16:35.143
She doesn't sound
that interested

01:16:35.144 --> 01:16:37.298
in your proposition,
Edward.

01:16:37.299 --> 01:16:39.329
In time she'll come
to understand.

01:16:39.344 --> 01:16:40.697
Will she?

01:16:43.207 --> 01:16:44.573
Thank you.

01:16:46.676 --> 01:16:49.451
You know, I won't deny
that things have gotten

01:16:49.452 --> 01:16:52.278
progressively worse
during your absence.

01:16:52.279 --> 01:16:56.010
The public, the military;
Everyone seemed starving.

01:16:56.155 --> 01:17:00.048
Our blood supplies
are well, gone.

01:17:00.049 --> 01:17:01.284
Ed.

01:17:01.330 --> 01:17:04.188
I myself was feeling
the effects of deprivation.

01:17:05.119 --> 01:17:07.595
But as of yesterday

01:17:08.171 --> 01:17:10.146
it's all a thing of the past.

01:17:13.543 --> 01:17:16.898
You know, I always
thought it would be you

01:17:16.899 --> 01:17:19.505
that would come up
with a stable substitute.

01:17:19.747 --> 01:17:23.332
Not Christopher. But,
I guess I was wrong.

01:17:23.778 --> 01:17:28.459
Look. We go into mass
production in two days.

01:17:29.035 --> 01:17:31.984
It's never been about a cure.

01:17:33.218 --> 01:17:35.464
It's about repeat business.

01:17:38.612 --> 01:17:40.208
And besides...

01:17:41.321 --> 01:17:43.573
what's to cure?

01:17:47.307 --> 01:17:49.045
So you see, Edward.

01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:53.790
I don't need you anymore.

01:17:55.918 --> 01:17:58.529
Of course you couldn't
make it as a human.

01:17:59.308 --> 01:18:01.013
You're weak.

01:18:03.608 --> 01:18:05.042
The truth is:

01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:08.161
You've always been a coward.

01:18:12.207 --> 01:18:14.855
What did it feel like to
turn your own daughter?

01:18:16.651 --> 01:18:18.670
Oh, you didn't do it, did you?

01:18:18.994 --> 01:18:20.626
You couldn't, could you?

01:18:20.627 --> 01:18:23.557
You had my brother
do it for you.

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:28.140
So who's the fucking coward?

01:19:10.369 --> 01:19:13.768
Your blood.
What have you done to me?

01:19:16.418 --> 01:19:18.878
<i>Vampires think they
own this world.</i>

01:19:20.443 --> 01:19:22.751
<i>That the humans
have to hide from them.</i>

01:19:24.224 --> 01:19:25.807
<i>That ain't true.</i>

01:19:31.106 --> 01:19:34.470
<i>Every day, the sun comes up.</i>

01:19:38.571 --> 01:19:41.601
<i>And every day
the vamps have to hide.</i>

01:19:46.206 --> 01:19:48.186
<i>Vampires can never survive.</i>

01:19:49.626 --> 01:19:51.024
<i>That's the truth.</i>

01:19:55.798 --> 01:19:57.638
<i>Elvis Presley once said:</i>

01:19:58.319 --> 01:20:00.226
<i>"Truth is like the sun.</i>

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:03.996
<i>you can shut it
out for a time</i>

01:20:06.932 --> 01:20:08.325
<i>but it ain't going away".</i>

01:20:13.045 --> 01:20:14.371
<i>Mr. Bromley.</i>

01:20:14.786 --> 01:20:16.098
<i>Open up.</i>

01:20:17.018 --> 01:20:19.010
Treated vampire blood.

01:20:19.181 --> 01:20:21.084
That's the cure.

01:20:21.428 --> 01:20:23.198
Welcome back to humanity.

01:20:24.103 --> 01:20:26.197
Now you get to die.

01:20:35.045 --> 01:20:36.865
<i>Move. Move.</i>

01:21:52.951 --> 01:21:54.331
Let's go.

01:22:17.244 --> 01:22:18.570
Don't do this.

01:22:20.558 --> 01:22:22.058
There's a cure.

01:22:23.897 --> 01:22:25.344
Don't do this.

01:22:32.174 --> 01:22:33.658
Run.

01:22:44.142 --> 01:22:45.453
Ed.

01:25:53.737 --> 01:25:55.397
They can't be the cure.

01:25:56.272 --> 01:25:58.212
I can't let you do it.

01:25:59.987 --> 01:26:01.340
I'm sorry.

01:27:28.976 --> 01:27:30.572
We have a cure.

01:27:30.847 --> 01:27:32.741
We can change you back.

01:27:33.012 --> 01:27:34.690
It's not too late.
