- PREVIOUSLY ON<i>MILLION DOLLAR</i>
<i>LISTING NEW YORK...</i>

00:04.704 --> 00:06.473
- I WAS ABLE TO GET THEM
TO FULL ASKING.

00:06.506 --> 00:08.775
- OKAY, 11.95 MILLION.
YOU GOT A DEAL.

00:08.808 --> 00:10.243
YOU'RE GONNA GET
YOUR [bleep] DEAL.

00:10.276 --> 00:12.412
- BIGGEST DEAL OF MY CAREER,
LET'S GO!

00:12.445 --> 00:14.848
- YOU'RE GONNA HAVE
TO OPEN UP, TRY.

00:14.881 --> 00:15.982
- HOLD ON ONE SECOND.

00:16.016 --> 00:18.685
ALL I CAN HEAR IS, LIKE,
YOU, YOU, YOU, YOU.

00:18.718 --> 00:20.120
- DAMN IT.

00:21.554 --> 00:24.524
- I MISS YOU.

00:24.557 --> 00:26.659
- 2A DIED.

00:26.693 --> 00:29.696
SHE CAN'T AFFORD IT.

00:31.931 --> 00:34.034
- GOOD-BYE.
[phone beeps]

00:37.270 --> 00:39.406
- MY MOTTO IS
EXPANSION...

00:39.439 --> 00:42.475
ALWAYS IN ALL WAYS.

00:42.509 --> 00:45.812
- NEW YORK CITY IS THE MOST
EXCITING CITY FOR REAL ESTATE,

00:45.845 --> 00:46.913
AND THAT'S WHY I'M HERE.

00:46.946 --> 00:49.249
- I'M THE CLOSER
AND A LISTING MACHINE.

00:49.282 --> 00:50.784
WHAT MAKES ME BETTER
IS THAT I WORK HARDER

00:50.817 --> 00:51.818
THAN ANYONE ELSE.

00:51.851 --> 00:52.952
WAAH!

00:52.986 --> 00:54.454
- I WILL BREAK YOUR TEETH.
- REACH HIGH.

00:54.487 --> 00:55.755
- CAN YOU TAKE THIS GUY
OUT OF HERE?

00:55.789 --> 00:57.190
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?
- YOU'RE NOT TRYING TO HELP ME.

00:57.223 --> 01:00.226
- WHAT?
- YOU WANT TO CONTROL ME.

01:10.537 --> 01:14.908
- PUERTO RICO!

01:14.941 --> 01:17.243
[line trilling]

01:17.277 --> 01:19.612
MOM.

01:19.646 --> 01:22.315
GUESS WHAT.

01:23.950 --> 01:27.087
YES, I'M IN PUERTO RICO!

01:27.087 --> 01:28.588
[laughs]

01:28.621 --> 01:29.789
I JUST LANDED.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.491
LISTEN, I'M GOING
TO BAHIA BEACH RESORT

01:31.524 --> 01:33.660
'CAUSE I HAVE SOME CLIENTS
COMING IN

01:33.693 --> 01:35.228
A LITTLE BIT LATER TODAY.

01:35.261 --> 01:36.363
I AM IN PUERTO RICO!

01:36.396 --> 01:37.364
[laughs]

01:37.397 --> 01:38.698
PUERTO RICO IS
EVERYTHING TO ME.

01:38.732 --> 01:41.768
IT'S MY SOUL,
AND IT FEELS AMAZING DOWN HERE.

01:41.801 --> 01:44.004
I MOVED FROM PUERTO RICO
WHEN I WAS 16 YEARS OLD.

01:44.104 --> 01:46.306
I TOLD MY PARENTS
I WAS GOING TO THE BEACH,

01:46.339 --> 01:49.376
AND INSTEAD I TOOK A ONE-WAY
TICKET TO FORT LAUDERDALE.

01:49.409 --> 01:51.144
I WAS A STOCK-ROOM BOY
DURING THE DAY,

01:51.177 --> 01:53.813
AND I WAS A JANITOR AT NIGHT.

01:53.847 --> 01:55.382
AND THAT WAS ALL BEFORE
I WENT TO NEW YORK CITY.

01:55.415 --> 01:57.317
I HAVEN'T BEEN HERE
IN ALMOST TWO YEARS.

01:57.350 --> 01:58.685
NOW I HAVE CLIENTS
FROM NEW YORK

01:58.718 --> 02:00.653
THAT WANT TO BUY
A VACATION HOME RIGHT HERE.

02:00.687 --> 02:03.156
- WE'RE IN THE MARKET
FOR A VACATION HOME.

02:03.189 --> 02:04.657
WE WANT TO GET RIGHT
OFF THE PLANE,

02:04.691 --> 02:06.693
RIGHT TO THE BEACH--
MAYBE MIAMI.

02:06.726 --> 02:08.428
- I DON'T THINK YOU WANT
TO GO TO MIAMI.

02:08.461 --> 02:09.863
YOU WANT TO GO TO PUERTO RICO.

02:09.896 --> 02:12.899
PUERTO RICO IS THE STRAIGHT
DEFINITION OF PARADISE.

02:12.932 --> 02:14.200
- ALL RIGHT.
- OKAY.

02:14.234 --> 02:15.935
- ALL RIGHT, WE'RE GOING
TO PUERTO RICO, DR. JONES.

02:15.969 --> 02:18.204
I DON'T HAVE MY REAL-ESTATE
LICENSE IN PUERTO RICO,

02:18.238 --> 02:19.839
WHICH MEANS I'M NOT GETTING PAID
ON THIS DEAL.

02:19.873 --> 02:21.274
BUT THE JONESES
ARE VERY GOOD CLIENTS OF MINE,

02:21.307 --> 02:23.543
AND I'M DOING THIS TO KEEP
THEIR BUSINESS.

02:23.576 --> 02:26.880
AND I HAVEN'T SEEN MY FAMILY,
SO IT'S JUST ALL A BONUS.

02:26.913 --> 02:28.415
- I'LL CALL YOU
SOMETIME TOMORROW.

02:28.448 --> 02:30.183
BUT I WANT TO SEE YOU.

02:30.216 --> 02:31.751
[laughs]

02:31.785 --> 02:34.320
I LOVE YOU TOO,<i>MAMI.</i>
I'LL SEE YOU VERY SOON.

02:34.354 --> 02:35.321
BYE-BYE.

02:35.355 --> 02:37.090
WOW, LOOK AT THIS ISLAND.

02:45.131 --> 02:46.766
- MY SECOND LISTING
AT THE APTHORP

02:46.800 --> 02:49.369
WITH MY CLIENT ARI HAS BEEN
A REAL WAKE-UP CALL.

02:49.402 --> 02:50.937
THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

02:50.970 --> 02:53.106
ARI DID AN AMAZING JOB
RENOVATING

02:53.139 --> 02:55.008
THE LIVING ROOM, THE DINING
ROOM, AND THE BEDROOMS.

02:55.108 --> 02:56.609
BUT...

02:56.643 --> 02:57.811
UGH.

02:57.844 --> 03:00.947
HE NEVER TOUCHED THE BATHROOMS
OR THE KITCHEN.

03:01.047 --> 03:03.183
OOH, THOSE BATHROOMS.
- RIGHT.

03:03.216 --> 03:05.385
- IT WAS AGAINST MY BETTER
JUDGMENT TAKING THE LISTING.

03:05.418 --> 03:07.187
LET ME SHOW YOU THE KITCHEN.
- OH, MY GOD.

03:07.220 --> 03:09.389
- I SHOULD HAVE PUT
MY FOOT DOWN AND SAID,

03:09.422 --> 03:11.725
"ARI, DON'T LIST IT YET.
RENOVATE IT."

03:11.758 --> 03:14.127
- PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE KITCHEN.
PEOPLE DON'T LIKE THE BATHROOMS.

03:14.160 --> 03:15.662
- AND NOW I'M OUT OF TIME.

03:15.695 --> 03:17.097
- WE'RE GONNA TAKE IT
OFF THE MARKET.

03:17.130 --> 03:19.199
- WHAT?
- I'M GONNA RENT IT.

03:19.232 --> 03:21.601
IF I RENOVATE IT,
THEN I'LL REACH OUT TO YOU

03:21.634 --> 03:23.870
AND DECIDE THEN--
- REALLY? YOU WOULD?

03:23.903 --> 03:25.205
- YEAH.

03:25.238 --> 03:27.140
- I'M GONNA LET IT GO,

03:27.173 --> 03:28.341
AND I HOPE IT COMES BACK.

03:28.375 --> 03:29.776
AND IF IT DOESN'T,
THAT'S OKAY TOO.

03:29.809 --> 03:33.079
FERNANDO,
CAN YOU TAKE ME TO SOHO?

03:33.113 --> 03:34.080
- YES, SIR.

03:34.114 --> 03:35.215
- I'M PICKING MYSELF UP,

03:35.248 --> 03:36.483
AND NOW I'M ON
TO MY NEXT LISTING.

03:36.516 --> 03:38.551
GREENE STREET IS ONE
OF THE MOST FABULOUS STREET

03:38.585 --> 03:40.620
LOCATED IN SOUTH SOHO.

03:40.653 --> 03:45.592
LOTS AND LOTS OF COBBLESTONE
AND CAST-IRON BUILDINGS.

03:45.625 --> 03:47.093
STEVE, THE OWNER
OF THE PENTHOUSE

03:47.093 --> 03:48.094
AT 20 GREENE STREET,

03:48.094 --> 03:50.263
IS A FORMER CLIENT OF MINE,

03:50.296 --> 03:52.098
AND I SOLD STEVE
THE PENT TEN MONTHS AGO

03:52.132 --> 03:53.266
AS AN INVESTMENT PROPERTY,

03:53.299 --> 03:56.936
BUT APPARENTLY
HE HAS COMPLETELY RENOVATED IT.

03:56.970 --> 03:59.105
AND NOW I'M GONNA GO BACK
AND TAKE A LOOK

03:59.105 --> 04:00.073
AT THE COMPLETED JOB.

04:00.106 --> 04:02.175
- HELLO.

04:02.208 --> 04:03.176
FREDRIK?

04:03.209 --> 04:05.578
- [gasps]
- FREDRIK.

04:05.612 --> 04:07.180
- HEY. HOW ARE YOU?
- GOOD, GOOD, GOOD.

04:07.213 --> 04:10.050
- WOW, THIS IS AMAZING.

04:10.050 --> 04:11.151
STOP ONE SECOND.

04:11.184 --> 04:12.919
ARE YOU ACTUALLY THINKING
OF SELLING IT?

04:12.952 --> 04:14.654
- YOU MUST BE
A FORTUNE TELLER. YES.

04:14.688 --> 04:16.656
- OH, MY GOD,
I LOVE MY CLIENTS.

04:16.690 --> 04:19.292
OKAY, SO I NEED TO SEE IT.

04:19.325 --> 04:21.061
EVERYTHING IS NEW, NEW, NEW?
- EVERYTHING IS NEW--

04:21.094 --> 04:23.663
BRAND-NEW.

04:23.697 --> 04:26.099
- HOW DID YOU MAKE
THE ROOM BIGGER?

04:26.132 --> 04:28.301
- WE RIPPED IT OUT,
REDID THE WHOLE THING,

04:28.335 --> 04:29.636
PUT IN THE FLOORS.

04:29.669 --> 04:31.071
- NEW STAIRCASE.
- BRAND-NEW.

04:31.071 --> 04:33.473
KITCHEN'S ALL NEW.

04:33.506 --> 04:37.077
I GOT $3 MILLION
IN RENOVATION IN HERE.

04:39.846 --> 04:42.115
FREDRIK, LET ME SHOW YOU
THE OUTDOOR TERRACE THAT WE DID.

04:42.148 --> 04:43.483
CHECK THIS OUT.

04:43.516 --> 04:45.819
- OH!
- FABULOUS, RIGHT?

04:45.852 --> 04:48.288
- OH, MY GOD.

04:48.321 --> 04:50.824
EVERY LANDMARK.
- BEAUTIFUL, RIGHT?

04:50.857 --> 04:54.494
- I LOVE NEW YORK!
- [laughs]

04:54.527 --> 04:56.963
- LET'S GO DOWN AND TALK PRICE.
- OKAY.

04:56.996 --> 04:59.299
OH, NOW LET'S TALK.

04:59.332 --> 05:02.035
- IT'S A LITTLE CLOSE, NO?
- COME HERE, BABY.

05:02.068 --> 05:03.403
- WHOO.
[chuckles]

05:03.436 --> 05:06.239
STEVE HAS
AN ECCENTRIC PERSONALITY, YES,

05:06.272 --> 05:07.807
BUT I LOVE ECCENTRIC PEOPLE.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.876
GIVE ME COLOR,
GIVE ME CRAZINESS,

05:09.909 --> 05:11.277
GIVE ME LAUGHTER,

05:11.311 --> 05:13.079
AND GIVE ME COMMISSIONS.

05:13.113 --> 05:16.683
IT IS ONE OF THE BEST PENTHOUSES
I'VE SEEN IN A LONG TIME.

05:16.716 --> 05:19.252
- SO? WHAT ARE WE TALKING
ABOUT HERE?

05:19.285 --> 05:21.254
- OKAY.
WELL, LET'S DO THE MATH.

05:21.287 --> 05:24.157
I SOLD IT TO YOU TEN MONTHS AGO.
- ABOUT TEN MONTHS AGO.

05:24.190 --> 05:25.892
- FOR 9.7 MILLION.

05:25.925 --> 05:27.427
YOU PUT IN...

05:27.460 --> 05:29.329
- MM-HMM.
- OKAY.

05:29.362 --> 05:31.064
MY BRAIN IS WORKING.
YOU SEE THE SMOKE COMING OUT?

05:31.064 --> 05:33.967
[imitates buzzing]

05:34.067 --> 05:36.536
OKAY, 14 MILLION.
- NO.

05:36.569 --> 05:39.072
- WHAT DO YOU MEAN NO?

05:39.072 --> 05:41.341
- 14 MILLION IS NOT HAPPENING.

05:41.374 --> 05:43.610
THAT'S NOT THE MAGIC NUMBER,
NOT FOR ME.

05:43.643 --> 05:44.811
- WHAT IS IT?

05:44.844 --> 05:46.513
- I PERSONALLY WOULD LIKE
ABOUT 16 MILLION.

05:46.546 --> 05:47.514
- 16 MILLION?
- 16 MILLION.

05:47.547 --> 05:48.515
- NO.

05:48.548 --> 05:50.984
WE HAVE TO BE REALISTIC HERE.

05:51.084 --> 05:53.086
YOU BOUGHT THIS
AT 9.7 MILLION TEN MONTHS AGO.

05:53.119 --> 05:54.921
THE MARKET HASN'T MOVED UP

05:54.954 --> 05:56.456
65% IN THAT TIME.

05:56.489 --> 05:58.291
IT'S TOO EARLY FOR THAT PRICE.

05:58.324 --> 05:59.826
DON'T YOU GET IT?

05:59.859 --> 06:01.928
16 MILLION IS TOO MUCH.

06:02.028 --> 06:05.465
THE 9.7 MILLION PURCHASE PRICE
ONLY TEN MONTHS AGO

06:05.498 --> 06:07.300
IS OFFICIAL INFORMATION.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.536
ANY BROKER/BUYER COMING
AND BIDDING ON THIS,

06:09.569 --> 06:11.338
REGARDLESS OF HOW MANY MILLIONS
YOU PUT INTO IT,

06:11.371 --> 06:15.742
IS GONNA SEE THAT THERE'S
A $5 MILLION DELTA THERE.

06:15.775 --> 06:17.444
- OKAY, 15 MILLION
AND YOU WANT TO KNOW WHY

06:17.477 --> 06:19.546
I'M NOT--WANT TO GO
A DOLLAR ABOVE THAT?

06:19.579 --> 06:22.649
BECAUSE AT 15 MILLION, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT A 55% INCREASE.

06:22.682 --> 06:25.118
- IT'S ONE OF THE BEST AREAS
IN THE WORLD.

06:25.151 --> 06:26.786
WE'RE IN SOHO.

06:26.820 --> 06:28.955
WE'RE IN ONE
OF THE BEST BUILDINGS IN SOHO.

06:29.055 --> 06:30.557
- IT'S A CONDOMINIUM.
IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

06:30.590 --> 06:31.758
IT DOESN'T HAVE A DOORMAN.
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANY AMENITIES.

06:31.791 --> 06:33.126
IT DOESN'T HAVE PARKING,
SWIMMING POOL.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.161
IT DOESN'T HAVE ANYTHING.

06:35.195 --> 06:36.663
OKAY, YOU HAVE TO TAKE
PROFESSIONAL ADVICE.

06:36.696 --> 06:39.899
15 MILLION, WE'RE GOOD.

06:43.069 --> 06:44.571
- 15 MILLION...

06:44.604 --> 06:45.572
NOT A PENNY LESS.

06:45.605 --> 06:46.673
- 15 MILLION.

06:46.706 --> 06:48.441
OKAY, WE HAVE--
- YO! YO!

06:48.475 --> 06:50.710
[laughs]
- OKAY, LOVE YOU.

06:50.744 --> 06:52.946
15 MILLION.
<i>CIAO.</i>

06:58.718 --> 07:00.720
- HAVE YOU BEEN HERE BEFORE?

07:00.754 --> 07:01.721
- NO.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.690
- I LOVE THIS PLACE.

07:03.723 --> 07:05.158
THE LAST TIME I SAW EMILIA,

07:05.191 --> 07:08.328
THINGS DIDN'T REALLY GO
SO WELL.

07:08.361 --> 07:11.531
- IF YOU DON'T HAVE
ANYTHING MORE TO GIVE ME,

07:11.564 --> 07:13.800
THEN I DON'T HAVE ANYTHING ELSE
TO GIVE YOU.

07:13.833 --> 07:15.068
- WE'LL TALK
ABOUT THIS STUFF LATER.

07:15.101 --> 07:16.336
- NO, WE'RE TALKING
ABOUT IT NOW.

07:16.369 --> 07:17.904
- I DON'T WANT TO TALK
RIGHT NOW, THEN.

07:17.937 --> 07:19.172
- THAT DOESN'T WORK FOR ME.

07:19.205 --> 07:21.541
- OKAY, SO IT DOESN'T WORK
FOR YOU.

07:21.574 --> 07:22.542
- DAMN IT.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.811
[door closes]

07:24.844 --> 07:27.247
- THANK YOU.
- YOU'RE WELCOME.

07:27.280 --> 07:30.350
- I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT IT A LOT LATELY,

07:30.383 --> 07:32.619
AND I KNOW I HAVE
TO APOLOGIZE.

07:32.652 --> 07:35.588
CAN I GET TWO GLASSES
OF THE BARBERA, PLEASE?

07:35.622 --> 07:37.090
YEAH.
- PERFECT.

07:37.123 --> 07:39.626
- BUT I JUST--
I DON'T KNOW HOW.

07:39.659 --> 07:44.064
- GLASS OF BARBERA.
- THANK YOU.

07:47.867 --> 07:52.572
- SO...
- I'M GONNA NEED THIS.

07:53.606 --> 07:54.941
- YOU LOOK VERY PRETTY.

07:59.512 --> 08:03.650
CAN I CONFESS SOMETHING
TO YOU, THOUGH?

08:03.683 --> 08:05.618
I'M MUCH MEANER
THAN I USED TO BE.

08:05.652 --> 08:07.520
- YOU'RE MUCH MEANER
THAN YOU USED TO BE?

08:07.554 --> 08:11.124
- YEAH. I'M A PRODUCT
OF MY ENVIRONMENT.

08:11.157 --> 08:13.693
- NEW YORK?

08:13.727 --> 08:15.028
- EXACTLY.

08:15.028 --> 08:17.163
I HAVEN'T ALWAYS BEEN
LIKE THIS.

08:17.197 --> 08:19.366
I MEAN, I USED TO ACTUALLY
BE A PRETTY NICE GUY.

08:19.399 --> 08:23.570
BUT OVER THE YEARS, I THINK
I HAD TO GET A LITTLE TOUGHER

08:23.603 --> 08:27.240
BECAUSE LIVING IN NEW YORK CITY
CAN BE BRUTAL.

08:27.273 --> 08:28.475
AND EVERYTHING
JUST KIND OF BLED

08:28.508 --> 08:30.910
INTO MY PERSONAL LIFE,
AND NOW I'M...

08:30.944 --> 08:32.879
UM...

08:32.912 --> 08:36.049
IN DANGER OF LOSING SOMEONE
I REALLY CARE ABOUT.

08:36.049 --> 08:37.283
SERIOUSLY...

08:37.317 --> 08:39.052
- ALL RIGHT, SERIOUSLY, WHAT?

08:40.253 --> 08:42.722
- WHAT DO YOU WANT?

08:42.756 --> 08:45.058
WHAT DO YOU WANT, EMILIA?

08:45.091 --> 08:48.695
- THE REAL RYAN.

08:48.728 --> 08:50.930
- I HAVE NO IDEA
WHO THE REAL RYAN IS.

08:55.101 --> 08:58.304
I DON'T--
HONESTLY, I DON'T KNOW.

08:58.338 --> 09:01.641
IT MAKES ME VERY UNCOMFORTABLE
TO TALK ABOUT MYSELF.

09:01.675 --> 09:03.710
BUT IN THIS CASE,
IF I DON'T,

09:03.743 --> 09:07.013
EMILIA'S GOING TO LEAVE.

09:08.748 --> 09:11.685
RIGHT.
OKAY, SO...

09:11.718 --> 09:15.555
I MET MY DAD FOR THE FIRST TIME
WHEN I WAS IN THE FOURTH GRADE.

09:15.588 --> 09:18.258
I WAS, LIKE, TEN.

09:18.291 --> 09:23.096
AND I HAVE TWO DADS,
BY THE WAY.

09:23.129 --> 09:25.565
I CALL THEM DAD-DAD
AND BOB-DAD.

09:25.598 --> 09:29.736
DAD-DAD CALLED ME DOWN
TO THE BREAKFAST ROOM

09:29.769 --> 09:32.539
IN MY HOUSE AND WAS LIKE,
"SIT DOWN."

09:32.572 --> 09:34.040
I WAS LIKE, "OKAY."

09:34.074 --> 09:36.676
AND HE WAS, LIKE, VERY STRICT,
SO I THOUGHT I WAS IN TROUBLE.

09:36.710 --> 09:39.612
HE SAID,
"YOUR BIOLOGICAL FATHER CALLED.

09:39.646 --> 09:41.514
HE'D LIKE TO SEE YOU."

09:41.548 --> 09:46.219
AND THAT MOMENT STARTED
THIS KIND OF SERIES OF TRIPS,

09:46.252 --> 09:49.255
WHERE I STARTED SEEING
MY BIOLOGICAL DAD.

09:49.289 --> 09:53.893
SO DAD-DAD IS MY DAD,
BUT TRUTHFULLY HE'S MY STEPDAD.

09:53.927 --> 09:57.097
HE MARRIED MY BIOLOGICAL MOM
WHEN I WAS JUST A BABY

09:57.130 --> 10:01.134
AND ADOPTED ME,
AND I TOOK HIS LAST NAME.

10:01.167 --> 10:04.270
AND MY BIOLOGICAL DAD
IS WHO I CALL BOB-DAD.

10:04.304 --> 10:07.607
BUT I DIDN'T KNOW HIM
TILL I WAS AROUND TEN.

10:07.640 --> 10:10.877
MEETING BOB-DAD, HE'S VERY
INTO, LIKE, ARTS AND STUFF,

10:10.910 --> 10:12.178
AND WE WOULD GO SEE PLAYS.

10:12.212 --> 10:14.180
I WATCHED MY FIRST
"R"-RATED MOVIE WITH HIM--

10:14.214 --> 10:17.550
<i>TRUE LIES</i>
WITH ARNOLD SCHWARZENEGGER.

10:17.584 --> 10:18.852
WHEN YOU'RE TEN

10:18.885 --> 10:20.754
AND ALL OF A SUDDEN
YOU'RE INTRODUCED

10:20.787 --> 10:23.056
TO YOUR BIOLOGICAL DAD

10:23.089 --> 10:26.426
AND HE IS IMMEDIATELY LIKE YOU,

10:26.459 --> 10:30.130
IT WAS--YOU KNOW, IT'S
A MOMENT I'LL NEVER FORGET.

10:30.163 --> 10:32.165
I GOT TO GO ON, LIKE,
MY FIRST BIG TRIP

10:32.198 --> 10:34.134
BECAUSE BOB-DAD WANTED
TO TAKE ME

10:34.167 --> 10:35.535
TO, LIKE, SEE THE WORLD.

10:35.568 --> 10:37.671
AND SO WE WENT TO ITALY.

10:37.704 --> 10:40.473
BUT WHERE IT WAS
THE TOUGHEST FOR ME

10:40.507 --> 10:43.176
WAS REALLY
THE, YOU KNOW, GOING BETWEEN

10:43.209 --> 10:44.978
BOB-DAD AND PARENTS,
BOB-DAD AND PARENTS.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.580
LIKE, I WOULD GET, LIKE,
JUST DISTRAUGHT.

10:47.614 --> 10:51.584
I FELT LIKE HALF OF MY BODY WAS
BEING, LIKE, RIPPED APART.

10:51.618 --> 10:54.988
AND SO, OVER TIME,
IT WASN'T A CONSCIOUS DECISION,

10:55.021 --> 10:57.357
BUT I THINK I JUST,
YOU KNOW, WAS, LIKE,

10:57.390 --> 11:00.627
"WELL, I CAN'T--
I CAN'T FEEL LIKE THIS."

11:00.660 --> 11:02.395
YOU KNOW, IF YOU'RE GONNA SHUT
THAT OFF,

11:02.429 --> 11:05.699
I PROBABLY AT THE SAME TIME
SHUT OFF EVERYTHING ELSE.

11:05.732 --> 11:09.636
I'M JUST--I KNOW THAT SOUNDS
PROBABLY WEIRD TO HEAR,

11:09.669 --> 11:12.305
BUT IT'S A BIG THING FOR ME.

11:12.339 --> 11:15.075
- DOESN'T IT FEEL GOOD?

11:15.075 --> 11:18.078
- YES, IT DOES.

11:18.111 --> 11:21.348
OPENING UP IS NEVER
GOING TO BE EASY FOR ME.

11:21.381 --> 11:23.483
BUT IF OPENING UP MEANS
EXPANDING

11:23.516 --> 11:24.984
MY RELATIONSHIP WITH EMILIA,

11:25.085 --> 11:27.987
THEN I'M GONNA DO MORE OF IT.

11:28.088 --> 11:29.456
SO WHAT'S YOUR PLAN
THIS WEEKEND?

11:29.489 --> 11:31.524
- I DON'T KNOW.
WHAT IS MY PLAN THIS WEEKEND?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.464
- COMING UP...
- IT WAS BUILT IN THE '80s.

11:37.497 --> 11:38.598
- WOW.

11:38.631 --> 11:40.100
I'VE HAD LISTINGS
WHERE THE SELLERS

11:40.133 --> 11:42.002
HAVE LEFT THE HOMES VACANT
FOR A FEW YEARS,

11:42.102 --> 11:43.436
NOT 30.

11:43.470 --> 11:45.638
NO WAY.

12:00.453 --> 12:02.355
- THERE THEY ARE.
- HEY.

12:02.389 --> 12:03.456
- HOW ARE YOU GUYS?

12:03.490 --> 12:05.291
SO, GUYS, THIS IS
DR. AND MRS. JONES.

12:05.325 --> 12:06.559
- VERY NICE TO MEET YOU.
PLEASURE.

12:06.593 --> 12:07.927
THIS IS RICARDO.
HE'S A SENIOR SALES EXECUTIVE.

12:07.961 --> 12:09.429
THIS IS ABDELNASSER.

12:09.462 --> 12:11.431
HE WILL BE REPRESENTING US
IN THE DEAL ON THE BUYER'S SIDE.

12:11.464 --> 12:13.433
SO WE'RE GONNA START
BY SHOWING THE AMENITIES.

12:13.466 --> 12:14.968
WHEN A BUYER'S BUYING
A SECONDARY HOME,

12:15.068 --> 12:17.137
IT'S MUCH MORE THAN JUST
THE ASKING PRICE

12:17.170 --> 12:18.238
OR THE NUMBER.

12:18.271 --> 12:19.739
IT'S REALLY
ABOUT THE EXPERIENCE.

12:19.773 --> 12:21.307
THEIR BUDGET
IS AROUND $1 MILLION.

12:21.341 --> 12:22.642
BUT THEY REALLY WANT
TO SEE EVERYTHING

12:22.676 --> 12:24.511
THAT THE ST. REGIS
HAS TO OFFER

12:24.544 --> 12:26.079
REGARDLESS
OF THE PRICE POINTS,

12:26.079 --> 12:27.313
WHICH IS GREAT
BECAUSE THE UNITS

12:27.347 --> 12:29.849
AT THIS RESORT START
AT ABOUT $1.5 MILLION.

12:32.318 --> 12:35.088
THE ST. REGIS ESTATE IS
THE MOST LUXURIOUS DEVELOPMENT

12:35.088 --> 12:37.157
IN THE ENTIRE ISLAND
OF PUERTO RICO.

12:37.190 --> 12:38.458
AND THE JONESES WANT LUXURY.

12:38.491 --> 12:40.126
THEY'RE ONLY INTERESTED
IN FIVE-STAR.

12:40.160 --> 12:42.295
AND THIS PLACE IS
THE ONLY FIVE-STAR HOTEL

12:42.328 --> 12:44.798
AND RESIDENCE PROJECT
IN THE ENTIRE ISLAND.

12:44.831 --> 12:46.766
I HAVE STAYED THERE MYSELF,
AND I HAVE TO TELL YOU

12:46.800 --> 12:48.668
THAT THE EXPERIENCE IS
LIKE NO OTHER.

12:48.702 --> 12:50.337
IT HAS GOLF COURSES.
IT HAS POOLS.

12:50.370 --> 12:51.705
- THIS IS THE MONEY SHOT HERE.

12:51.738 --> 12:53.106
- TOP-OF-THE-LINE SPA

12:53.106 --> 12:54.741
AND ONE OF THE MOST BEAUTIFUL
BEACHES IN THE WORLD.

12:54.774 --> 12:56.609
- TELL YOU WHAT, THIS FEELS
BETTER THAN THE STREETS

12:56.643 --> 12:58.511
OF MANHATTAN.
- OH, YEAH.

12:58.545 --> 13:00.347
IF YOU OWN A PROPERTY
IN THE ST. REGIS RESORT,

13:00.380 --> 13:02.549
YOU LITERALLY
NEVER HAVE TO LEAVE.

13:02.582 --> 13:03.750
ALL RIGHT, GUYS,
THIS IS THE FIRST PLACE

13:03.783 --> 13:05.051
WE'RE GOING TO SEE.

13:05.085 --> 13:06.720
- AND THE WATER IS RIGHT ON
THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS.

13:06.753 --> 13:08.188
- YEP.
- YEP, RIGHT IN FRONT.

13:08.221 --> 13:09.723
- THIS FIRST PLACE IS EVERYTHING
THEY'VE REQUESTED.

13:09.756 --> 13:12.058
IT'S VERY CLOSE TO THE BEACH.
IT HAS OUTDOOR SPACE.

13:12.092 --> 13:13.727
AND IT'S BEAUTIFUL.

13:13.760 --> 13:17.097
- WHITE ON WHITE--
- WOW. LOOK AT THIS VIEW.

13:18.832 --> 13:20.166
- PLEASE TAKE IT ALL IN.

13:20.200 --> 13:22.936
- I MEAN, IS THIS BEAUTIFUL
OR WHAT?

13:33.613 --> 13:35.949
- SO THIS IS THE MASTER.

13:35.982 --> 13:37.684
- WHAT DO YOU GUYS THINK?

13:37.717 --> 13:39.786
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL, UNDENIABLY.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.123
BUT I THINK IT'S--IT JUST FEELS
A LITTLE COMPACT TO ME.

13:43.156 --> 13:44.758
- WE THINK THAT
ON A VACATION SPOT,

13:44.791 --> 13:46.092
WE'D WANT TO HAVE
A LITTLE BIT MORE ROOM.

13:46.126 --> 13:47.694
WE WANT TO BE ABLE TO WALK
IN THE DOOR

13:47.727 --> 13:52.098
AND JUST FEEL LIKE YOU'RE
IN A VAST, YOU KNOW, ROOM.

13:52.098 --> 13:53.600
- THEY'RE LOOKING
FOR A BIGGER PLACE.

13:53.633 --> 13:55.101
I DEFINITELY HAVE BIGGER.

13:55.101 --> 13:57.103
ALL RIGHT, SO I GUESS THIS
MAY BE A LITTLE BIT TOO SMALL,

13:57.103 --> 13:58.138
SO LET'S GO
FOR THE NEXT OPTION

13:58.171 --> 13:59.539
AND FIND A LITTLE BIT BETTER
THAN THIS.

13:59.572 --> 14:01.441
ALL RIGHT.
NEXT.

14:09.382 --> 14:11.217
[oven beeps]

14:11.251 --> 14:13.353
- AH, IT SMELLS LIKE GARLIC.

14:13.386 --> 14:15.255
- IT SMELLS LIKE ESCARGOT.

14:15.288 --> 14:17.924
- FOR THIS LISTING, I'M GONNA
TRY SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

14:17.957 --> 14:20.960
INSTEAD OF AN OPEN HOUSE,
I'M GONNA DO PRIME SHOWINGS

14:21.061 --> 14:22.328
OFF MARKET.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.664
I WANT IT TO FEEL EXCLUSIVE.

14:24.698 --> 14:26.633
I LIKE THIS.
IT'S HIGH-END--

14:26.666 --> 14:29.069
CHAMPAGNE, SNAILS, CAVIAR.

14:29.069 --> 14:30.770
I'M GOING ONLY
TO THE BROKERS

14:30.804 --> 14:33.106
I'VE DONE BIG, BIG,
MEGA DEALS WITH,

14:33.139 --> 14:35.909
'CAUSE I KNOW THEY REPRESENT
MULTIMILLIONAIRES.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.143
[doorbell rings]
[gasps]

14:37.177 --> 14:38.678
OH, SOMEONE'S HERE.
BE READY.

14:38.712 --> 14:41.081
HI.
WELCOME TO 20 GREENE.

14:41.081 --> 14:42.415
WELCOME.
MWAH.

14:42.449 --> 14:43.416
MWAH.

14:43.450 --> 14:45.185
SNAILS, CAVIAR,

14:45.218 --> 14:46.286
CHAMPAGNE?

14:46.319 --> 14:48.588
- GEORGE DON IS FROM FRANCE.

14:48.621 --> 14:50.657
- REALLY?
-<i>OUI, OUI.</i>

14:50.690 --> 14:51.691
- HMM.
-<i>OUI, OUI.</i>

14:51.725 --> 14:53.727
- COME ON, LET ME SHOW
YOU AROUND.

14:53.760 --> 14:55.895
SO EVERYTHING IS BRAND-NEW--

14:55.929 --> 14:59.099
FLOORS, WALLS, FIREPLACE,
BATHROOMS,

14:59.099 --> 15:01.034
BUILT FOR A QUEEN
LIKE YOU.

15:01.067 --> 15:02.369
- THERE YOU GO.

15:02.402 --> 15:04.671
- THIS IS A KING, LIKE YOU.
YOU'RE A KING.

15:04.704 --> 15:06.239
THIS TERRACE IS MORE THAN
A THOUSAND WORDS.

15:06.272 --> 15:08.041
LOOK AT THIS.
THIS IS INCREDIBLE.

15:08.041 --> 15:09.442
- IT'S SPECTACULAR.

15:09.476 --> 15:11.211
- THIS IS THE KIND OF THING
THAT WE'VE BEEN LOOKING FOR.

15:11.244 --> 15:13.246
- AS PREDICTED,
EVERYONE WHO'S SEEING

15:13.279 --> 15:15.115
THIS PENTHOUSE LIKES IT,

15:15.148 --> 15:17.917
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?
LIKING ISN'T ENOUGH.

15:17.951 --> 15:19.753
I WANT OFFERS.

15:19.786 --> 15:21.454
THE PRICE IS 15 MILLION.

15:21.488 --> 15:23.056
IT WAS PRICED
TO SELL IMMEDIATELY.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.058
I'M TALKING, LIKE,
THINKING ABOUT IT,

15:25.058 --> 15:26.459
ABSORBING IT, HAVING A GLASS
OF WINE TONIGHT,

15:26.493 --> 15:28.728
AND MAKING A DECISION
AND EMAILING ME THE OFFER.

15:28.762 --> 15:30.463
YOU KNOW, YOU HAVE
A UNIQUE OPPORTUNITY HERE.

15:30.497 --> 15:31.564
- I DO.

15:31.598 --> 15:32.699
- LOOK AT
THE EMPIRE STATE BUILDING.

15:32.732 --> 15:34.200
- NO, LOOK AT ME.

15:34.234 --> 15:36.603
I WANT YOU TO ACKNOWLEDGE
THAT YOU'RE ONE OF THREE HERE.

15:36.636 --> 15:37.971
- DO YOU HAVE OFFERS
IN ON IT YET?

15:38.071 --> 15:40.840
- NO, BECAUSE I STARTED SHOWING
ABOUT HALF AN HOUR AGO.

15:40.874 --> 15:43.376
BUT I THINK IN ABOUT ANOTHER
HALF HOUR, I'LL HAVE SOMETHING.

15:43.410 --> 15:45.211
ON THAT NOTE...
[doorbell rings]

15:45.245 --> 15:47.947
SOMEONE ELSE IS HERE.

15:53.086 --> 15:55.622
- 203.

15:55.655 --> 15:56.723
WOW.

15:56.756 --> 15:59.092
MY NEW LISTING IS
FOR A TOWNHOUSE

15:59.125 --> 16:01.027
ON 71ST STREET IN LENOX HILL.

16:01.027 --> 16:04.364
LENOX HILL IS THE LOWER PART
OF THE UPPER EAST SIDE

16:04.397 --> 16:06.433
THAT'S KNOWN
FOR ITS TREE-LINED STREETS

16:06.466 --> 16:10.570
AND CLASSIC TOWNHOUSES THAT
PEOPLE WILL LITERALLY KILL FOR.

16:10.603 --> 16:12.305
- HOW YOU DOING?
SYDNEY MARTINEZ.

16:12.339 --> 16:13.573
- THANKS FOR HAVING ME OVER.
- NO PROBLEM.

16:13.606 --> 16:16.443
- SYDNEY IS A PRIVATE BANKER
WHO MANAGES THE ACCOUNTS

16:16.476 --> 16:18.378
FOR THE FAMILY
THAT OWNS THIS HOUSE.

16:18.411 --> 16:20.280
I LIKE THE GREEN CARPET.
- MM-HMM.

16:20.313 --> 16:21.648
- ONE OF THE REASONS
SYDNEY CALLED ME

16:21.681 --> 16:24.050
IS THAT I JUST SOLD
A TOWNHOUSE DOWN THE BLOCK

16:24.084 --> 16:25.819
IN ABOUT SIX HOURS.

16:25.852 --> 16:29.055
- SO THIS IS THE LIVING ROOM.

16:29.055 --> 16:30.924
- WOW.
- UH-HUH.

16:30.957 --> 16:33.059
- THIS IS SUPER '80s.
- YES, IT IS.

16:33.059 --> 16:34.327
- THERE'S A LOT
OF GREEN TILE, HUH?

16:34.361 --> 16:37.230
- YEAH. IT WAS BUILT
IN THE '80s.

16:37.263 --> 16:40.066
AND NO ONE'S LIVED HERE SINCE,
SO IT HASN'T BEEN TOUCHED.

16:40.066 --> 16:41.534
- THIS IS UNBELIEVABLE.

16:41.568 --> 16:43.937
MAYBE THEY WERE JUST WAITING
FOR ME TO BE BORN

16:43.970 --> 16:47.374
AND GROW UP SO THAT
I COULD COME AND SELL IT.

16:47.407 --> 16:48.408
- VERY OLD SCHOOL.

16:48.441 --> 16:50.643
- THIS IS AWESOME.
- YEAH.

16:50.677 --> 16:54.614
- THANK YOU FOR WAITING.
YOUR BROKER HAS ARRIVED.

17:10.196 --> 17:11.598
WHAT IS THIS?

17:11.631 --> 17:13.199
- IT'S A VIDEO INTERCOM.

17:13.233 --> 17:14.234
- WOW.

17:14.267 --> 17:16.403
THIS IS, LIKE,
THE FIRST ONE, I THINK.

17:16.436 --> 17:18.705
THIS IS A TIME CAPSULE.

17:18.738 --> 17:21.141
NO WAY.
- YES, YES, YES, YES.

17:21.174 --> 17:23.677
- WHOA! THIS IS THE COOLEST
THING I'VE EVER SEEN.

17:23.710 --> 17:26.413
AND YOU HAVE A 1982 TELEVISION
OVER THERE

17:26.446 --> 17:27.814
WITH A RECORD PLAYER?

17:27.847 --> 17:29.115
DO YOU SEE THAT?

17:29.149 --> 17:30.684
I'M JUST A LITTLE GEEKED OUT
BY ALL OF THIS.

17:30.717 --> 17:31.685
- [laughs]

17:31.718 --> 17:33.119
- IT IS CLEARLY OLD,

17:33.153 --> 17:35.155
BUT I THINK IT'S A GOOD PROJECT
FOR SOMEBODY,

17:35.188 --> 17:37.457
AND I THINK THE BONES ARE GREAT.
- YEAH.

17:37.490 --> 17:39.292
- TO FIND A 25-FOOTER
ON THE UPPER EAST SIDE

17:39.325 --> 17:41.394
IS AN INCREDIBLE FEAT.

17:41.428 --> 17:42.862
BEFORE GOING
THROUGH EVERYTHING,

17:42.896 --> 17:44.731
YOU WANT TO GO AND SEE
THE GARDEN DOWNSTAIRS?

17:44.764 --> 17:46.599
- SO THERE IS ONE THING
ABOUT THAT.

17:46.633 --> 17:49.369
THERE'S A TENANT DOWN THERE,
SO WE CAN'T GO THROUGH THERE

17:49.402 --> 17:52.072
BECAUSE THEY HAVE
A LEASE UNTIL 2050.

17:52.072 --> 17:56.076
- 2015?
- NO, 2050.

17:56.076 --> 17:58.211
SO...
- 2050?

17:58.244 --> 18:00.180
- 2050, CORRECT.

18:00.213 --> 18:02.315
- WHAT?

18:02.349 --> 18:03.316
NO.

18:03.350 --> 18:05.018
WELL, THAT'S A WEIRD THING.

18:05.051 --> 18:08.421
IN 2050, I WILL BE 65.

18:08.455 --> 18:10.857
IS THERE ANY CHANCE
OF BUYING OUT THE TENANT?

18:10.890 --> 18:12.025
- NO.
- NO.

18:12.025 --> 18:13.426
- WHEN THEY AGREED ON IT,

18:13.460 --> 18:15.829
THE OWNER'S FAMILY KNEW
THE TENANT'S FAMILY VERY WELL,

18:15.862 --> 18:17.897
SO THEY GAVE THEM
A LONG-TERM LEASE.

18:17.931 --> 18:19.432
- THEY DON'T PAY, LIKE,
150 BUCKS

18:19.466 --> 18:20.700
A MONTH IN RENT, DO THEY?

18:20.734 --> 18:24.170
- NO, IT'S $15,000 A MONTH.
- OH, THANK GOD.

18:24.204 --> 18:26.139
OKAY. SO THAT'S A GOOD AMOUNT
OF RENT, THEN...

18:26.172 --> 18:27.140
- UH-HUH.

18:27.173 --> 18:28.842
- FOR THE BOTTOM TWO FLOORS,
I GUESS?

18:28.875 --> 18:30.110
- CORRECT.

18:30.143 --> 18:31.878
- AND THE RENTER HAS
THEIR OWN PRIVATE ENTRANCE.

18:31.911 --> 18:33.546
YOU NEVER SEE THEM.

18:33.580 --> 18:35.615
ALL YOU'RE DOING IS CASHING
CHECKS EVERY MONTH.

18:35.648 --> 18:37.283
- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT.

18:37.317 --> 18:38.685
THIS IS NEW YORK CITY.

18:38.718 --> 18:41.221
THE WEIRDEST [bleep] HERE
HAPPENS EVERY SINGLE DAY.

18:41.254 --> 18:44.524
- SO WHAT DO YOU ENVISION
PRICE-WISE FOR THE HOME?

18:44.557 --> 18:46.259
- IF THIS HOUSE DIDN'T HAVE
A TENANT

18:46.292 --> 18:48.161
AND DIDN'T NEED TO BE RENOVATED,

18:48.194 --> 18:50.163
I'D PRICE THIS HOUSE
AT $12 MILLION.

18:50.196 --> 18:52.432
BUT IN THIS CASE,
THE COMPS DON'T MATTER.

18:52.465 --> 18:55.135
I THINK $7 MILLION
IS THE NUMBER.

18:55.168 --> 18:57.537
- ALL RIGHT, SO...

18:57.570 --> 19:00.840
I MEAN, I'VE SPOKEN TO HIM
ABOUT THIS.

19:00.874 --> 19:03.777
AND WE WERE LOOKING MORE
OF IN THE RANGE OF 7.5 MILLION.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.879
- I'M SURE.
- YEAH.

19:05.912 --> 19:08.648
- YOU HAVE TO MAKE THE HOUSE
SEEM ATTRACTIVE TO PEOPLE

19:08.682 --> 19:10.016
WHO ARE GONNA WANT
TO DO THE WORK.

19:10.016 --> 19:12.018
- 7.5 MILLION WOULD BE
THE BOTTOM LINE.

19:12.052 --> 19:15.088
- OKAY.
- SO THAT'S THE LOWEST.

19:16.189 --> 19:17.924
- ALL RIGHT,
7 1/2 MILLION.

19:18.024 --> 19:21.094
BUT IF I SELL THIS,
WHICH I'M GOING TO,

19:21.127 --> 19:23.630
I WANT THAT BLACK PANTHER.

19:23.663 --> 19:25.565
[cat roars]

19:25.598 --> 19:27.033
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S DO IT.

19:27.067 --> 19:29.302
YOU'RE MY MAN, RYAN.
- YOU'RE MY MAN.

19:29.336 --> 19:30.370
- [laughs]

19:30.403 --> 19:32.372
- COMING UP...
- SINCE I WAS WITH YOU,

19:32.405 --> 19:33.740
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY
DATED ANYBODY.

19:33.773 --> 19:36.142
FIORELLA IS THE ONLY GIRLFRIEND
THAT I'VE EVER HAD.

19:36.176 --> 19:38.378
- [speaking Spanish]

19:38.411 --> 19:39.612
- SORRY.

19:50.490 --> 19:53.059
- NOW, WE'RE GOING TO GO
A STEP UP IN PRICE.

19:53.059 --> 19:55.061
THE PRICE IS $2.5 MILLION.

19:55.061 --> 19:56.162
- JUST EASE HIM INTO IT.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.597
- YEAH, EASE ME INTO IT,
PLEASE.

19:57.630 --> 20:01.034
- WE CAN SELL HIM IF IT HAS
EVERYTHING WE WANT, YOU KNOW.

20:01.067 --> 20:02.902
- CATHLEEN WAS NOT REALLY
IN LOVE WITH THE FIRST PLACE,

20:02.936 --> 20:04.304
SO I'M SWITCHING UP GEARS
A LITTLE BIT,

20:04.337 --> 20:06.773
AND I'M GONNA SHOW THEM
A BEAUTIFUL BEACHFRONT VILLA

20:06.806 --> 20:08.208
THAT'S A LITTLE BIT
OVER THEIR PRICE RANGE,

20:08.241 --> 20:10.910
BUT HAS EVERYTHING THAT SHE DID
NOT LIKE ABOUT THE FIRST PLACE.

20:10.944 --> 20:12.512
- WE'RE GONNA COME THROUGH
THE BACK OF THE HOUSE.

20:12.545 --> 20:15.715
- WHOA.
- YES.

20:20.020 --> 20:21.354
- LOOK AT THIS KITCHEN.
- WOW.

20:21.388 --> 20:22.889
- THIS IS DOUBLE THE SIZE
OF THE ONE--

20:22.922 --> 20:24.324
- THIS IS BEAUTIFUL.

20:24.357 --> 20:26.326
- ONE OF THE BEAUTIFUL
THINGS ABOUT HERE

20:26.359 --> 20:27.660
IS HAVING A FULL STAFF.

20:27.694 --> 20:29.596
- CHEF SERVICE,
WHATEVER YOU GUYS NEED,

20:29.629 --> 20:30.697
WE WILL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

20:30.730 --> 20:32.699
- NICE. VERY NICE.
- OKAY.

20:32.732 --> 20:35.735
LET'S TAKE A LOOK
AT THE BEDROOMS.

20:38.905 --> 20:40.807
- IDEALLY, FOR US,
IF WE COULD HAVE

20:40.840 --> 20:42.175
FOUR BEDROOMS
AND FOUR BATHROOMS,

20:42.208 --> 20:43.376
THEY'D BE VERY HAPPY.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.111
- IT'S JUST A LITTLE
ON THE SMALL SIDE.

20:45.145 --> 20:46.212
WE HAVE FOUR KIDS.

20:46.246 --> 20:47.380
WE IDEALLY WANT TO BE ABLE

20:47.414 --> 20:49.349
TO ACCOMMODATE EVERYBODY
IN THE HOLIDAY SEASON.

20:49.382 --> 20:51.051
- OF COURSE.
- I LOVE IT, THOUGH. IT'S JUST--

20:51.084 --> 20:53.019
- IT'S BEAUTIFUL.
- THIS, A LITTLE BIGGER.

20:53.053 --> 20:54.287
- OKAY, OFF TO THE NEXT.

20:54.320 --> 20:56.356
- WOW. THIS IS TOO SMALL
FOR THEM?

20:56.389 --> 20:57.991
I HAVE SOMETHING ELSE
THAT I CAN SHOW THEM,

20:58.024 --> 20:59.526
BUT IT'S FOUR TIMES
THEIR BUDGET.

20:59.559 --> 21:00.894
I MEAN, IF THEY WANT
TO SEE EVERYTHING,

21:00.927 --> 21:02.595
I'LL SHOW THEM THE WORLD.

21:02.629 --> 21:05.065
- LOOK AT THIS.
- WELCOME HOME.

21:05.065 --> 21:08.068
- LIVING ROOM, DINING ROOM,

21:08.068 --> 21:10.837
DOUBLE HIGH CEILINGS.
- WOW.

21:10.870 --> 21:12.872
- 7,400 SQUARE FEET.
- 7,400.

21:12.906 --> 21:14.774
- I CAN JUST FEEL
THAT THIS PRICE

21:14.808 --> 21:16.443
IS GETTING HIGHER AND HIGHER.

21:16.476 --> 21:17.977
I'M GETTING HOT HERE, SO...
- YES.

21:18.078 --> 21:20.447
- WHY DON'T YOU JUST SHARE IT
WITH US RIGHT NOW?

21:20.480 --> 21:23.750
- $4.1 MILLION.

21:23.783 --> 21:25.085
- LISTEN...

21:25.085 --> 21:27.220
THIS IS THE WAY WE LIKE TO LIVE,
NO QUESTION.

21:27.253 --> 21:29.222
- YOU GOT TO REMEMBER,
THIS IS JUST A SECOND HOUSE.

21:29.255 --> 21:30.857
- OKAY, LET'S JUST LOOK
AT THE REST.

21:30.890 --> 21:33.393
- LET'S JUST LOOK AT THE REST,
BECAUSE I'M SOLD.

21:33.426 --> 21:34.761
I DON'T KNOW ABOUT HIM.

21:34.794 --> 21:37.197
- YES, PLEASE,
LOOK AT THIS PLACE.

21:37.230 --> 21:38.365
- NO.
- [laughs]

21:38.398 --> 21:41.534
- IS THIS A KITCHEN,
OR IS THIS A KITCHEN?

21:41.568 --> 21:43.103
- I MAY NOT EVEN GO BACK
TO NEW YORK.

21:43.136 --> 21:46.006
- ALL RIGHT.
[laughter]

21:53.947 --> 21:56.716
- THIS IS
THE MAIN MASTER BEDROOM.

21:56.750 --> 21:58.985
- O.M.G.

21:59.019 --> 22:00.186
- LOOK AT THIS.

22:00.220 --> 22:05.058
- THIS IS EXACTLY
WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

22:05.058 --> 22:07.460
THIS REALLY IS
THE PERFECT HOUSE.

22:07.494 --> 22:09.062
I COULD ACTUALLY SEE US
LIVING HERE.

22:09.062 --> 22:10.163
- NOW, WAIT A MINUTE NOW.

22:10.196 --> 22:11.631
LET'S SLOW DOWN JUST
A LITTLE BIT.

22:11.664 --> 22:13.333
AGAIN, THIS IS
A VACATION HOME.

22:13.366 --> 22:14.801
WE'RE NOT MOVING DOWN HERE.

22:14.834 --> 22:15.935
- WHY DON'T WE GO BACK?

22:15.969 --> 22:17.437
I'LL DROP YOU GUYS
BACK AT THE HOTEL,

22:17.470 --> 22:19.406
THINK ABOUT IT A LITTLE BIT, AND
WE'LL REGROUP IN THE MORNING.

22:19.439 --> 22:21.107
- THANK YOU SO MUCH.
- MY PLEASURE.

22:25.412 --> 22:26.513
- HI, GUYS.

22:26.546 --> 22:30.083
- WELCOME BACK.
- HI, ROBERT. HOW ARE YOU?

22:30.083 --> 22:31.785
WHAT ARE THESE--
THE TIES OR THE SHIRTS?

22:31.818 --> 22:33.286
- THOSE ARE THE SHIRTS.
- SHIRTS AND TIES.

22:33.319 --> 22:34.554
- WOW.
SO MUCH?

22:34.587 --> 22:36.856
[cell phone ringing]

22:36.890 --> 22:38.091
FREDRIK SPEAKING.

22:38.091 --> 22:39.759
- FREDRIK, SCOTT FAVA
FROM CORCORAN HERE.

22:39.793 --> 22:42.128
HOW ARE YOU?
- HI, SCOTT.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.572
WHAT ARE YOU SAYING TO ME?
YOU HAVE AN OFFER?

22:56.309 --> 22:59.012
9.7 MILLION TEN MONTHS AGO.

23:06.820 --> 23:09.689
SCOTT, STOP RIGHT THERE.
LISTEN TO ME RIGHT NOW.

23:09.723 --> 23:12.058
$13 MILLION ON
A $15 MILLION ASK?

23:12.058 --> 23:15.695
- HE'S GOT TO COME UP.

23:15.729 --> 23:16.696
- SCOTT...

23:16.730 --> 23:19.799
I BROUGHT YOU IN
TO DO YOU A FAVOR

23:19.833 --> 23:21.768
TO HAVE YOU COME IN
AND SEE SOMETHING

23:21.801 --> 23:23.069
THAT NO ONE'S SEEN BEFORE,

23:23.069 --> 23:25.472
NOT TO HUMILIATE ME
IN FRONT OF MY CLIENT

23:25.505 --> 23:29.676
AND MAKE ME LOOK LIKE A FOOL.

23:29.709 --> 23:31.244
OH, IT WILL DEFINITELY
NOT WORK.

23:31.277 --> 23:34.414
I AM GLAD I GOT AN OFFER
FROM SCOTT.

23:34.447 --> 23:37.384
BUT I KNOW STEVE
IS NOT GONNA LIKE IT.

23:37.417 --> 23:40.086
HOWEVER, SCOTT'S BUYERS
ARE SEERS. I KNOW IT.

23:40.120 --> 23:41.921
THEY LIKE THE APARTMENT.
THEY WANT IT.

23:41.955 --> 23:43.857
SO I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
SOME WAY

23:43.890 --> 23:45.992
TO BRING THEM CLOSER UP
TO ASK,

23:46.092 --> 23:48.194
OR I'LL HAVE TO FIND
A DIFFERENT BUYER.

23:50.663 --> 23:54.100
IT'S NOT GONNA BE GOOD NEWS FOR
YOU, BUT I'LL CALL YOU SHORTLY.

23:54.100 --> 23:55.802
- WE HAVE TO COME WORK
WITH YOU, FREDRIK.

23:55.835 --> 23:57.837
THAT'S SOME
TOUGH NEGOTIATION THERE.

23:57.871 --> 24:00.173
- I KNOW.
SO HOW MUCH DO I OWE YOU?

24:00.206 --> 24:01.741
- $690.

24:01.775 --> 24:03.710
- IT'S ACTUALLY CHEAPER
THAN LAST WEEK.

24:03.743 --> 24:05.078
CHARGE IT.

24:13.053 --> 24:15.722

24:20.527 --> 24:21.728
WHERE ARE YOU?

24:24.731 --> 24:26.266

- HOW SICK IS THIS?

24:42.415 --> 24:44.084

24:44.117 --> 24:45.318
- THIS IS GONNA STAY OUTSIDE.

SORRY I'M LATE,
BUT WHERE I'M GOING,

24:49.989 --> 24:52.092
I DON'T NEED ROADS.

24:52.092 --> 24:53.493
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS.

24:53.526 --> 24:55.528
SO WE'LL DO PHOTO OP OUT HERE
TO GET PEOPLE IN THE MOOD,

24:55.562 --> 24:56.963
AND THEN WE'LL GO
INTO THE TOWNHOUSE.

24:56.996 --> 24:59.099
NICE TUTU. IS IT BLINKING?
- YES.

24:59.099 --> 25:00.867
- OKAY, LET'S GO INSIDE
AND GET EVERYTHING DONE.

25:00.900 --> 25:04.237
MY STRATEGY WITH THIS LISTING
FROM THE GET-GO IS TO EMBRACE IT

25:04.270 --> 25:05.605
FOR WHAT IT IS.

25:05.638 --> 25:07.674
WE NEED TO CELEBRATE

NO, DON'T USE THAT.

25:17.484 --> 25:19.319
I'M GONNA GO SELL A HOUSE.

25:19.352 --> 25:21.154
HEY, MAN. WHAT'S GOING ON?
GOOD TO SEE YOU.

25:21.187 --> 25:23.623
HELLO.
WELCOME TO 1985.

25:23.656 --> 25:25.291
YOU WANT TO WEAR A WRISTBAND?

25:25.325 --> 25:27.127
- ALL RIGHT.
- HEADBAND, THERE YOU GO.

25:27.160 --> 25:29.062
YOUR HEAD LOOKS COLD.
YOU SHOULD WEAR A HEADBAND.

25:29.062 --> 25:30.063
- [laughs]

25:30.063 --> 25:31.598
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

25:31.631 --> 25:33.099
THIS IS WHAT I WEAR EVERY DAY.
- YEAH?

25:33.133 --> 25:35.669
- I LOVE THE '80s.
THAT'S RIGHT.

25:35.702 --> 25:38.805
ALL RIGHT, I'LL SHOW YOU
THE HOUSE NOW.

25:38.838 --> 25:40.674
WHAT'S GREAT IS THE BONES.

25:40.707 --> 25:43.610
SO IT'S 25 FEET WIDE,
SO IT'S A MANSION BY DEFINITION.

25:43.643 --> 25:44.944
I MEAN, IF YOU WANT TO RIP
THIS WHOLE THING DOWN

25:44.978 --> 25:49.749
AND JUST DO A BIG GLASS FACADE,
YOU CAN DO IT.

25:49.783 --> 25:52.385
HEADBAND LOOKS GREAT,
BY THE WAY.

25:52.419 --> 25:53.687
- 7.5 MILLION.

25:53.720 --> 25:56.289
THERE'S A TENANT WHO HAS
THE TWO DOWNSTAIRS FLOOR,

25:56.322 --> 26:00.293
AND SHE HAS A LEASE
UNTIL 2050.

26:00.326 --> 26:02.362
COOL?
- ARE YOU SERIOUS?

26:02.395 --> 26:04.497
- YEAH.

26:04.531 --> 26:05.699
- WELL, IT'S NOT THAT LONG.

26:05.732 --> 26:07.200
AND SHE DOESN'T PAY
600 BUCKS A MONTH.

26:07.233 --> 26:08.702
SHE PAYS $15,000 A MONTH,

26:08.735 --> 26:10.704
AND THAT'LL ADJUST ACCORDING
TO THE CONSUMER PRICE INDEX,

26:10.737 --> 26:12.439
SO SHE'LL PAY A LOT OF MONEY.

26:12.472 --> 26:14.240
YEP, SO THAT COVERS
YOUR OPERATING EXPENSES

26:14.274 --> 26:16.109
ON YOUR MONTHLIES IN CASE YOU
WANT TO DO RENOVATION,

26:16.142 --> 26:18.645
WHICH YOU DON'T HAVE TO,
BECAUSE I THINK THIS PLACE

26:18.678 --> 26:20.213
IS PRETTY RAD.

26:20.246 --> 26:21.514

BUT YOU CAN.

26:21.548 --> 26:24.517
THIS OPEN HOUSE IS PACKED.

26:24.551 --> 26:26.820
WE GOT PEOPLE STOPPING
AND TALKING ON THE PHONE

26:26.853 --> 26:27.921
AND CALLING OTHER PEOPLE
TO COME.

26:27.954 --> 26:29.389
TAKE PHOTOS AND TWEET THEM
AND EVERYTHING.

26:29.422 --> 26:30.824
I WANT EVERYONE TO KNOW
ABOUT THIS HOUSE.

26:30.857 --> 26:32.158
THERE'S A DELOREAN HERE.

26:32.192 --> 26:35.462
WELCOME TO 1985.
THAT'S BEAUTIFUL.

26:35.495 --> 26:37.697
PEOPLE ARE CHECKING OUT
THE HOUSE AND HAVING FUN.

26:37.731 --> 26:40.100
THEY'RE DANCING.
THEY'RE DRINKING. IT'S CRAZY.

26:40.133 --> 26:41.534
YEAH, THAT'S SO EASY.

26:41.568 --> 26:43.236
WOW!

26:43.269 --> 26:44.304
WHOO!

26:44.337 --> 26:46.072
THAT'S AWESOME!

26:46.072 --> 26:47.440
MARK MY WORDS,
THIS OPEN HOUSE

26:47.474 --> 26:49.609
IS GONNA GENERATE
A LOT OF INTEREST.

26:49.642 --> 26:52.278
ONE, TWO, THREE, REAGAN!

26:52.312 --> 26:53.713
WHOO!

26:59.719 --> 27:01.454
- I HAVE SET UP
DR. AND MRS. JONES

27:01.488 --> 27:04.290
FOR A GREAT DAY AT THE SPA
AND A FULL ROUND OF GOLF.

27:04.324 --> 27:06.192
AND WHILE THEY'RE RELAXING,

27:06.226 --> 27:07.861
THERE IS SOMETHING
THAT HAS BEEN ON MY MIND

27:07.894 --> 27:10.330
FOR QUITE SOME TIME
THAT I FEEL THAT I NEED TO DO.

27:14.567 --> 27:15.769
- LUISI.

27:15.802 --> 27:18.371
- OH, MY GOD.

27:18.405 --> 27:19.372
[smooches]

27:19.406 --> 27:20.907
OH, FIORELLA.

27:20.940 --> 27:23.510
FIORELLA IS THE ONLY GIRLFRIEND
THAT I'VE EVER HAD.

27:23.543 --> 27:26.513
OH, MY GOD,
YOU HAVE YOUR BLONDE HAIR.

27:26.546 --> 27:29.282
- YES.
BLONDER THAN EVER.

27:29.315 --> 27:31.584
- I MET HER IN PUERTO RICO
WHEN I WAS 22 YEARS OLD.

27:31.618 --> 27:35.221
AND WE STARTED A VERY INTENSE,
ALMOST SELF-DESTRUCTIVE,

27:35.255 --> 27:38.124
BUT PASSIONATE LONG-DISTANCE
RELATIONSHIP FOR ONE YEAR.

27:38.158 --> 27:39.492
BUT THEN SHE ALSO LIVED
WITH ME

27:39.526 --> 27:41.394
FOR AN ENTIRE SUMMER HERE
IN NEW YORK.

27:41.428 --> 27:43.830
NOTHING ELSE MATTERED TO ME
EXCEPT HER.

27:43.863 --> 27:45.231
SO I'M GONNA TAKE YOU
TO THIS PLACE

27:45.265 --> 27:47.300
THAT I THINK YOU'LL LOVE A LOT--
IT'S A BOATHOUSE.

27:47.334 --> 27:49.636
THINGS DIDN'T FINISH OFF
IN THE BEST WAY POSSIBLE,

27:49.669 --> 27:54.174
AND I'M JUST HOPING
THAT MEETING WITH HER TODAY

27:54.207 --> 27:55.375
BRINGS ME SOME CLOSURE.

28:01.014 --> 28:02.282
WELL, YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL.

28:02.315 --> 28:04.751
- THANK YOU.
- YOU REALLY DO.

28:04.784 --> 28:06.853
SO, UM, I WANTED
TO SEE YOU BECAUSE--

28:06.886 --> 28:09.255
YOU KNOW, I'M SURE YOU KNOW
THIS, BUT I'VE NEVER TOLD YOU.

28:09.289 --> 28:10.724
YOU HAVE BEEN
AND YOU WILL ALWAYS BE

28:10.757 --> 28:12.359
A VERY IMPORTANT PART
OF MY LIFE.

28:12.392 --> 28:14.594
AND I KIND OF FEEL LIKE
THAT WE KIND OF FINISHED OFF

28:14.627 --> 28:18.098
IN NOT THE BEST WAYS.

28:18.131 --> 28:19.532
WE USED TO FIGHT
ABOUT EVERYTHING,

28:19.566 --> 28:21.434
THE STUPIDEST THINGS.
- YEAH.

28:23.036 --> 28:26.673
- SOMETIMES I FELT THAT I NEEDED
TO PROVE SOMETHING MORE.

28:26.706 --> 28:29.342
AND BY DOING THAT,
I STARTED TO CHANGE.

28:29.376 --> 28:31.211
- BUT, LUIS,
IT WASN'T ALWAYS YOUR FAULT.

28:31.244 --> 28:34.381
LIKE, I WAS, LIKE,
FOR THE FIRST TIME

28:34.414 --> 28:37.550
LIVING WITH SOMEONE
OUTSIDE OF PUERTO RICO,

28:37.584 --> 28:42.088
SO IT WAS VERY STRANGE TO ME.

28:42.122 --> 28:43.923
- SINCE I WAS WITH YOU,

28:43.957 --> 28:45.825
I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY DATED
ANYBODY.

28:45.859 --> 28:47.694
I MEAN, I'VE--
YOU KNOW, I'VE DATED,

28:47.727 --> 28:50.296
BUT I HAVEN'T ACTUALLY HAD
A RELATIONSHIP WITH ANYBODY.

28:50.330 --> 28:52.165
EVER SINCE I BROKE UP
WITH FIORELLA,

28:52.198 --> 28:55.235
I HAVE BEEN REFUSING TO BE
WITH SOMEONE ELSE.

28:55.268 --> 28:56.670
WHEN I MET HER,

28:56.703 --> 28:58.972
I REMEMBER I WAS THE MOST
CONFIDENT PERSON IN THE WORLD.

28:59.072 --> 29:00.573
YOU KNOW,
NOTHING COULD DESTROY ME,

29:00.607 --> 29:04.411
BUT I STARTED TO LOSE MYSELF
IN WAYS THAT I NEVER IMAGINED.

29:04.444 --> 29:08.014
I'M SAD ABOUT THE FACT
THAT I STARTED TO LOSE MYSELF,

29:08.014 --> 29:10.350
AND I SPENT TOO MUCH TIME
GOING DOWN

29:10.383 --> 29:12.419
AND DOWN AND DOWN AND DOWN
UNTIL THERE WAS A POINT

29:12.452 --> 29:14.888
THAT I FELT THAT I WASN'T
BREATHING ANYMORE.

29:14.921 --> 29:17.157
SO WHEN--
- I KNOW. I FELT THE SAME WAY.

29:17.190 --> 29:18.825
I KNOW EXACTLY
WHAT YOU'RE SAYING.

29:18.858 --> 29:21.461
- SO IT TOOK ME 100 YEARS
TO GET BACK.

29:21.494 --> 29:23.296
THAT'S WHAT I'M AFRAID OF--

29:23.329 --> 29:26.433
DROWNING AGAIN.

29:28.568 --> 29:30.870
- [speaking Spanish]

29:30.904 --> 29:32.906
- [sighs]
SORRY.

29:37.844 --> 29:39.946
I'M AFRAID OF BEING
IN ANOTHER RELATIONSHIP.

29:40.046 --> 29:44.351
BECAUSE I'M AFRAID OF...

29:44.384 --> 29:46.853
COMING BACK TO THE POINT
THAT I WAS.

29:46.886 --> 29:49.222
I'M AFRAID
OF LOSING MYSELF...

29:49.255 --> 29:50.924
EXTREMELY.

29:52.258 --> 29:54.561
I MEAN, THE REASON I'M NOT
WITH ANYBODY ELSE

29:54.594 --> 29:56.863
IS BECAUSE THERE'S NOBODY
MORE BEAUTIFUL THAN YOU.

29:56.896 --> 29:58.932
[laughs]

29:58.965 --> 30:00.033
ARE YOU WITH A BOYFRIEND?
ARE YOU DATING SOMEONE?

30:00.066 --> 30:01.868
[laughing]
NO!

30:01.901 --> 30:03.803
I KNEW IT.

30:03.837 --> 30:04.804
- YOU KNEW.

30:04.838 --> 30:06.106
- BUT I'M HAPPY.
I REALLY AM.

30:06.139 --> 30:07.574
I REALLY AM HAPPY.

30:07.607 --> 30:11.044
AND I WANT YOU
TO BE A PART OF MY LIFE

30:11.077 --> 30:13.480
FOR THE REST OF MY LIFE.

30:13.513 --> 30:14.848
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO MARRY ME.

30:14.881 --> 30:16.750
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU KNOW...
[both laugh]

30:16.783 --> 30:18.885
AS FRIENDS.

30:18.918 --> 30:22.088
NEW YORK CITY--IT'S ALL
ABOUT MY WORK AND MY CAREER,

30:22.122 --> 30:25.458
BUT THERE'S A SIDE OF ME
THAT I'M AFRAID TO EXPLORE,

30:25.492 --> 30:27.460
WHICH IS THE SIDE OF ME
THAT WANTS TO FALL IN LOVE.

30:27.494 --> 30:30.296
AND PUERTO RICO REMINDS ME
A LOT ABOUT THAT.

30:30.330 --> 30:31.831
ALL RIGHT, YOU GOT TO HELP ME
WITH THIS THING.

30:31.865 --> 30:33.433
I DON'T KNOW IF THIS ENCOUNTER

30:33.466 --> 30:35.435
HAS BEEN ENOUGH
TO MAKE ME READY,

30:35.468 --> 30:40.140
BUT AT LEAST IT HAS BEEN A STEP
TO GETTING CLOSER TO...

30:42.142 --> 30:43.376
FALL IN LOVE AGAIN.

30:43.410 --> 30:45.745
LOOK HOW FAR WE ARE.
WE ARE SO [bleep].

30:45.779 --> 30:47.380
- [laughs]

30:47.414 --> 30:50.183
- COMING UP...

30:50.216 --> 30:54.087
- I LOOK AROUND, AND IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING.

30:54.120 --> 30:55.655
WHAT THE [bleep] JUST HAPPENED?

31:01.428 --> 31:03.463
- LISTEN, TAKE YOUR BEST SHOT
IN THE WORLD.

31:03.496 --> 31:05.065
THIS IS YOURS.
- THIS IS IT.

31:05.065 --> 31:07.734
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I THINK GOLF IS TOO PASSIVE.

31:07.767 --> 31:09.602
I LIKE INTENSITY.
I LIKE BOXING, LIKE...

31:09.636 --> 31:12.405
[breathing heavily]
YOU KNOW, SOMETHING LIKE...

31:12.439 --> 31:15.108
[claps hands]
THAT KEEPS YOU MOVING, YOU KNOW?

31:15.141 --> 31:17.777
GOLF IS KIND OF LIKE...

31:20.647 --> 31:22.082
[softly]
YES.

31:22.082 --> 31:24.150
- IF YOU GET A HOLE-IN-ONE,

31:24.184 --> 31:26.186
WE WILL BUY ANY PROPERTY
HERE TODAY.

31:26.219 --> 31:27.187
- THAT'S A DEAL.

31:27.220 --> 31:28.521
- DO YOU EVEN KNOW WHERE
THE HOLE IS?

31:28.555 --> 31:30.824
- I HAVE NO IDEA.
I'M JUST GONNA HIT THIS THING.

31:30.857 --> 31:32.192
- OH!
- ALL RIGHT! YAY!

31:32.225 --> 31:33.360
- PRACTICING,
YOU'RE PRACTICING.

31:33.393 --> 31:35.328
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S GO.

31:35.362 --> 31:36.396
THIS WAS OUR HOUSE.

31:36.429 --> 31:37.597
IT WENT, LIKE, TWO FEET.

31:37.630 --> 31:39.165
- OKAY. THIRD TIME IS
THE CHARM, ALL RIGHT?

31:39.199 --> 31:41.601
YOU'RE BUYING THIS ENTIRE--
- I'M BUYING THIS PLACE TODAY.

31:41.634 --> 31:42.836
YAY!
- OH!

31:42.869 --> 31:45.805
- OH!
- THERE YOU GO, LUIS!

31:45.839 --> 31:48.174
- OH, MY GOD!

31:48.208 --> 31:50.243
WHOA!
NOW I UNDERSTAND GOLF.

31:50.276 --> 31:51.244
THAT FELT AMAZING.

31:51.277 --> 31:52.712
- [laughs]
- THAT'S IT.

31:52.746 --> 31:54.647
THERE'S SOMETHING ABOUT HITTING
THAT LITTLE WHITE BALL.

32:04.758 --> 32:06.459
- SO HERE WE ARE. MR. JEFF.
- HI.

32:06.493 --> 32:07.660
- THERE HE IS.

32:07.694 --> 32:09.062
- HOW ARE YOU, MAN?
- HOW ARE YOU,<i>PAPI?</i>

32:09.095 --> 32:10.230
- OH.
- EVERYTHING GOOD?

32:10.263 --> 32:11.731
THIS IS MRS. JONES, DR. JONES.

32:11.765 --> 32:13.533
- HI.
HOW ARE YOU?

32:13.566 --> 32:15.402
- NOW THAT THE JONESES
HAVE EXPERIENCED

32:15.435 --> 32:17.103
EVERYTHING THAT THE ST. REGIS
HAS TO OFFER,

32:17.137 --> 32:19.673
I CAN FEEL THAT THEY'RE
VERY CLOSE TO MAKING A DECISION.

32:19.706 --> 32:22.442
NOW I WANT TO SHOW THEM
WHAT PUERTO RICO IS ALL ABOUT--

32:22.475 --> 32:24.411
SALSA, MUSIC, LIFE!

32:24.444 --> 32:27.414
[salsa music]

32:27.447 --> 32:35.455
* *

32:50.370 --> 32:51.938
THE NIGHT IS GOOD.
EVERYBODY'S DANCING.

32:51.971 --> 32:56.509
AND I LOOK AROUND, AND IT LOOKS
LIKE THEY'RE FIGHTING.

32:56.543 --> 32:57.577
WHAT?

33:01.815 --> 33:03.049
SINCE I'VE KNOWN THE JONESES,

33:03.049 --> 33:05.285
I HAVE NEVER SEEN THEM
HAVING AN ARGUMENT.

33:10.724 --> 33:12.726
WHAT THE [bleep] JUST HAPPENED?

33:18.198 --> 33:19.366
GUYS.
- I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

33:19.399 --> 33:21.067
- WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

33:21.067 --> 33:22.335
- WELL, THE PROBLEM IS
THAT WE'RE JUST--

33:22.369 --> 33:23.703
WE'RE SO FAR APART RIGHT NOW.

33:23.737 --> 33:25.372
- I JUST--I DON'T--
I MEAN, I DON'T UNDERSTAND

33:25.405 --> 33:26.840
WHAT THE PROBLEM IS.

33:26.873 --> 33:28.575
WE SAID WE WERE COMING HERE.
WE WERE LOOKING AT PROPERTIES.

33:28.608 --> 33:30.343
THE ONE THAT MAKES
THE MOST SENSE BUSINESS-WISE,

33:30.377 --> 33:32.846
YES, IT'S $4 MILLION,
BUT IT'S BIG.

33:32.879 --> 33:35.548
- BUT, BABY, WE CAME HERE WITH
WITH A $1 MILLION BUDGET, RIGHT?

33:35.582 --> 33:37.083
- YES.
- A $1 MILLION BUDGET.

33:37.117 --> 33:39.386
I'M UP TO $4 MILLION.
WE JUST DON'T NEED THAT.

33:39.419 --> 33:40.887
THAT'S NOT WHAT
WE CAME HERE FOR, BABE.

33:40.920 --> 33:43.089
I LOVE THAT PLACE
THAT'S ON THE BEACH.

33:43.089 --> 33:44.357
- THE OTHER ONE
IS THREE BEDROOMS, THOUGH.

33:44.391 --> 33:45.625
- IT'S PERFECT FOR US.

33:45.658 --> 33:47.527
IT'S STILL BIG ENOUGH
ON THE FLOOR PLAN.

33:47.560 --> 33:49.396
WE CAN HAVE OUR FAMILY THERE
ON HOLIDAYS,

33:49.429 --> 33:51.398
OUR EXTENDED FAMILY THERE
ON HOLIDAYS.

33:51.431 --> 33:52.565
IT'S 2.5 MILLION.

33:52.599 --> 33:54.200
I THINK THAT'S
MORE THAN REASONABLE.

33:54.234 --> 33:55.702
- OKAY.

33:55.735 --> 33:57.237
- LISTEN, YOU KNOW
WHO'S NOT GONNA BE HAPPY

33:57.270 --> 33:58.872
IF IT'S NOT EXACTLY
WHAT HE WANTS?

33:58.905 --> 34:01.041
- HIM.
- MR. PLASTIC SURGEON,

34:01.074 --> 34:02.876
WHO LOVES TO SEE
EVERYTHING PERFECT,

34:02.909 --> 34:04.377
AND I KNOW THAT
YOU'RE NOT GONNA BE HAPPY

34:04.411 --> 34:06.146
IF YOU DON'T GET EXACTLY
WHAT YOU WANT.

34:06.179 --> 34:07.781
- ALL RIGHT, LET'S START.

34:07.814 --> 34:09.049
THIS NEEDS TO BE SOLVED.

34:09.082 --> 34:10.316
- I JUST THINK AT THIS POINT,

34:10.350 --> 34:12.552
MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST HOLD OFF
AND DO NOTHING,

34:12.585 --> 34:15.889
'CAUSE CLEARLY WE'RE NOT REALLY
ON THE SAME PAGE.

34:15.922 --> 34:17.557
- HOLY [bleep],
THIS CANNOT BE HAPPENING.

34:17.590 --> 34:19.359
I TRIED TO SHOW THEM
EVERYTHING,

34:19.392 --> 34:20.960
SO THAT THEY CAN SEE
ALL THE OPTIONS AVAILABLE.

34:21.061 --> 34:23.063
BUT THIS MAY BACKFIRE ON ME.

34:34.507 --> 34:37.377
- AFTER MY SUCCESSFUL
1980s OPEN HOUSE...

34:37.410 --> 34:38.511
WELCOME TO 1985.

34:38.545 --> 34:40.113
- WHOO!
- THAT'S AWESOME!

34:40.146 --> 34:42.749
I HAVE BEEN SHOWING THERE
NONSTOP.

34:42.782 --> 34:44.718
- 25 FEET WIDE.
- YEAH, VERY WIDE.

34:44.751 --> 34:47.587
- YEAH, THE HOUSE WAS BUILT
IN 1983.

34:47.620 --> 34:49.089
- 7 1/2 MILLION.

34:49.089 --> 34:51.624
FIRST PERSON TO GIVE ME
7 1/2 MILLION WINS.

34:51.658 --> 34:53.893
AND AFTER MY SHOWINGS,
I GOT AN OFFER

34:53.927 --> 34:55.762
FROM A POTENTIAL BUYER
NAMED TOM

34:55.795 --> 34:57.230
FOR JUST OVER 7 MILLION...

34:57.263 --> 34:58.698
OKAY, LET ME, UH...

34:58.732 --> 35:00.700
YOU KNOW, I'LL SEE
WHAT I CAN DO ON MY END.

35:00.734 --> 35:02.135
WHICH NORMALLY
WOULD BE GREAT.

35:02.168 --> 35:06.272
BUT MY SELLER ISN'T TAKING
A DOLLAR LESS THAN 7.5 MILLION.

35:06.306 --> 35:08.041
SO WE WENT BACK AND FORTH
AND BACK AND FORTH

35:08.074 --> 35:09.509
AND BACK AND FORTH
AND BACK AND FORTH,

35:09.542 --> 35:12.746
AND NOW I'M JUST DIZZY.

35:12.779 --> 35:15.048
SYDNEY!
- HEY, RYAN.

35:15.048 --> 35:16.383
- WHAT'S GOING ON?
- HOW YOU DOING?

35:16.416 --> 35:17.717
HOW'S EVERYTHING?
- GOOD.

35:17.751 --> 35:19.219
- HAVE YOU GOT GOOD NEWS
FOR ME?

35:19.252 --> 35:21.821
- IT DEPENDS ON WHAT YOU THINK
IS GOOD NEWS.

35:21.855 --> 35:24.657
YOU KNOW, IF YOU THINK SELLING
THIS HOUSE

35:24.691 --> 35:28.061
FOR FULL ASKING PRICE IN
A MATTER OF DAYS IS GOOD NEWS,

35:28.094 --> 35:31.398
THEN, YEAH,
I GOT GOOD NEWS, BABY.

35:31.431 --> 35:33.700
- YOU GOT A FULL PRICE FOR ME?

35:33.733 --> 35:36.903
- YEAH, MAN.
7 1/2 MILLION, CASH,

35:36.936 --> 35:39.305
CLOSING IN 60 DAYS.
- WOW. THAT WAS QUICK.

35:39.339 --> 35:40.306
- IT WAS QUICK.

35:40.340 --> 35:41.675
SO...
[grunts]

35:41.708 --> 35:42.776
I WAS THINKING ABOUT THIS.

35:42.809 --> 35:43.943
I GOT MY CAR OUTSIDE.

35:43.977 --> 35:45.445
YOU THINK YOU COULD HELP ME
MOVE THIS GUY?

35:45.478 --> 35:48.915
- I THINK IT'S AMAZING THAT
YOU GOT FULL PRICE SO QUICKLY.

35:48.948 --> 35:49.916
- THANK YOU.

35:49.949 --> 35:52.619
- BUT, UH,
IT WAS RATHER QUICKLY.

35:52.652 --> 35:54.688
THE FACT THAT WE GOT IT
SO QUICKLY

35:54.721 --> 35:58.525
HAS ME QUESTIONING
WHETHER WE, UH...

35:58.558 --> 36:00.093
WE PRICED THIS PROPERLY.

36:00.126 --> 36:03.129

[computerized beeping]

36:03.163 --> 36:05.532
YO, WHERE ARE
THE JUMPING JACKS?

36:05.565 --> 36:09.469
I GOT HIM A FULL-ASK OFFER

36:09.502 --> 36:12.205
WHERE'S--WHERE'S, LIKE,
ALL THE JOY?

36:12.238 --> 36:15.208
WHERE'S THE EXCITEMENT?
WHERE'S THE TEARS OF HAPPINESS?

36:15.241 --> 36:16.943
YOU SAID 7 1/2 MILLION, RIGHT?

36:17.043 --> 36:19.112
- WE DID SAY 7 1/2 MILLION.

36:21.047 --> 36:22.482
YOU SHOULD BE HAPPY.

36:22.515 --> 36:23.950
- IT HASN'T BEEN
ON THE MARKET THAT LONG.

36:24.050 --> 36:25.819
MY THINKING IS...

36:25.852 --> 36:29.289
WHY NOT KEEP IT ON THE MARKET
AND POTENTIALLY CREATE

36:29.322 --> 36:30.790
A BIDDING WAR
SO THAT WE CAN GET MORE?

36:30.824 --> 36:33.159
I MEAN--
- HERE'S THE THING, ALL RIGHT?

36:33.193 --> 36:35.862
THIS HOUSE HAS A LOT OF ISSUES.

36:35.895 --> 36:40.066
AND I FOUND YOU A BUYER
WHO'S OKAY WITH THOSE ISSUES.

36:40.100 --> 36:41.468
IF YOU LEAVE HERE AND THINK,
"YOU KNOW WHAT?

36:41.501 --> 36:43.503
MAYBE WE SHOULD STAY
ON THE MARKET A LITTLE LONGER,"

36:43.536 --> 36:45.705
THAT GUY'S GONNA WALK.

36:45.739 --> 36:47.207
TIME KILLS DEALS.

36:47.240 --> 36:49.075
IT'S NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE.

36:49.075 --> 36:51.478

- YOU KNOW, I DO HAVE MY
CLIENT'S BEST INTERESTS IN MIND.

36:53.980 --> 36:55.782
DON'T YOU THINK MAYBE
WE CAN GET SOME MORE?

36:55.815 --> 36:57.083
- NO, NO, NO, NO.
NO, NO, NO.

36:57.083 --> 36:58.585
7 1/2 MILLION ISN'T JUST,
YOU KNOW, THIS--

36:58.618 --> 37:00.387
OH, SOMEONE JUST WALKED
IN THE DOOR AND SAID,

37:00.420 --> 37:01.921
"OH, HERE'S $7 1/2 MILLION."
NO.

37:02.022 --> 37:04.457
THEY STARTED AT 7.1 MILLION,
BUT I DIDN'T EVEN WANT

37:04.491 --> 37:06.259
TO PRESENT THAT BECAUSE
I KNEW YOU WOULDN'T TAKE IT,

37:06.292 --> 37:09.229
AND I CREATED THE MARKET

37:09.262 --> 37:12.499
THAT CREATED THIS
$7 1/2 MILLION BUYER.

37:12.532 --> 37:15.602
- [inhales sharply]
I MEAN, YOU--

37:15.635 --> 37:17.203

WHY YOU'RE PACING.

37:17.237 --> 37:18.605
YEAH, I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

37:18.638 --> 37:20.840
- YOU TALK A GOOD GAME
RIGHT NOW, BUT I'M CONCERNED.

37:20.874 --> 37:24.277
I MEAN, I JUST GOT TO REALLY
BELIEVE THAT, YOU KNOW,

37:24.310 --> 37:27.047
WE ARE GETTING THE BEST DEAL
THAT WE REALLY CAN RIGHT HERE.

37:27.047 --> 37:28.615

I PROMISE YOU.

37:28.648 --> 37:29.849
I PROMISE YOU.

37:29.883 --> 37:32.052
IN THE WORDS OF GORDON GEKKO,

37:32.052 --> 37:34.054
"GREED IS GOOD."

37:34.054 --> 37:36.056
IF YOU WAIT UNTIL 2015 OR 2016,

37:36.056 --> 37:38.224
WE HAVE NO IDEA WHERE
THE MARKET'S GONNA GO.

37:38.258 --> 37:40.827
"GREED IS RIGHT.

37:40.860 --> 37:43.897
"GREED WORKS"...

37:43.930 --> 37:45.498

37:45.532 --> 37:46.533

37:57.677 --> 37:59.379
AND THAT'S
HOW IT'S DONE, FOLKS.
