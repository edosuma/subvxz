00:10.435 --> 00:11.802
<i>Nice.</i>

00:11.804 --> 00:15.440
<i>Yeah. Nice.
Look at mom. All right.</i>

00:15.942 --> 00:17.240
<i>Ah-huh.</i>

00:17.242 --> 00:17.844
<i>Ah-huh.</i>

00:18.845 --> 00:20.610
<i>Beautiful.</i>

00:44.937 --> 00:47.239
- Bye, dad.
- Bye, sweetie.

01:02.320 --> 01:07.694
<i>Glendale, the jewel City,
my dad's favorite place in America.</i>

01:08.393 --> 01:12.799
<i>I think because here he,
technically, doesn't have an accent.</i>

01:13.498 --> 01:14.967
<i>At least for now.</i>

01:19.172 --> 01:25.477
<i>High school, four years of unforgettable joy,
fun, friends, parties, and falling in love.</i>

01:25.845 --> 01:27.947
Have a good day,
honey. Don't forget to sanitize.

01:37.824 --> 01:39.422
Oh my God, there she is.

01:39.424 --> 01:45.462
<i>Along with unbelievable
stress, excruciating pain, uncertainty,</i>

01:45.464 --> 01:50.737
<i>breakups, losing trust in friends
and betrayal, just to name a few.</i>

01:52.772 --> 01:56.608
<i>And this isn't even close
to the life you led at home.</i>

01:59.045 --> 02:02.014
No one, no one dumps me.

02:05.818 --> 02:08.853
<i>Oh God, this can't be happening.</i>

02:08.855 --> 02:10.555
<i>I can't believe this.</i>

02:13.760 --> 02:17.295
<i>When I thought things
cannot get any worse,</i>

02:19.397 --> 02:21.667
<i>I was wrong, it did.</i>

02:22.034 --> 02:25.069
Hi there, Sir, license
and registration please.

02:25.071 --> 02:29.909
<i>I knew this day would
come, making my life more miserable.</i>

02:49.561 --> 02:52.129
<i>My name is Tennie, I'm 17,</i>

02:52.131 --> 02:55.132
<i>and this is the beginning
of the worst time of my life.</i>

02:55.134 --> 02:57.935
Why haven't you been responding
to our texts? Is it true?

02:57.937 --> 02:58.702
Is what true?

02:58.704 --> 03:00.070
The rumor.

03:00.072 --> 03:01.972
Jason has been telling everyone
about what happened last night.

03:01.974 --> 03:04.141
- That, what, I broke up with him?
- No.

03:04.143 --> 03:07.745
He said you two had sex last night and
that you were not even good at all.

03:07.747 --> 03:11.015
He's, obviously, lying walking
around thinking he's hot shit.

03:11.017 --> 03:13.784
Yeah, we should get this
asshole for running his mouth.

03:13.786 --> 03:15.052
Well, people do believe him.

03:15.054 --> 03:16.519
What? Hold on.

03:16.521 --> 03:18.656
Weren't you supposed
to go to prom together?

03:18.658 --> 03:20.758
Could you
be any more useless?

03:20.760 --> 03:23.694
Shouldn't you be meeting your new
girlfriend that has you by the balls?

03:23.696 --> 03:25.830
She doesn't have
me by the balls.

03:25.832 --> 03:28.699
Jeez, Michelle, is it that
magical time of the month already?

03:28.701 --> 03:30.167
I can't believe
this is happening.

03:30.169 --> 03:31.235
Look at me.

03:31.237 --> 03:34.171
- He can't do this to you.
- It's not fair to you.

03:34.173 --> 03:35.574
So he did.

03:39.178 --> 03:40.980
It's a beautiful day.

03:42.014 --> 03:45.149
- Painkiller anyone?
- Advil, Tylenol, ibuprofen.

03:45.151 --> 03:46.650
I'll take one of each, please.

03:46.652 --> 03:51.088
Where have you been? I had to come
up with a bunch of excuses to explain

03:51.090 --> 03:54.861
why you were a no-show for the 10:00 a.m.
meeting, the 12:00 and then the 2 o'clock.

03:55.594 --> 03:58.561
That's your job, isn't it?
Daniella, come on, please.

03:58.563 --> 04:00.264
Okay.

04:00.266 --> 04:03.433
What about your realtor-turned girlfriend
Jenny who's been calling me all day worried

04:03.435 --> 04:05.435
because you haven't
been answering?

04:05.437 --> 04:08.438
- Daniella, why did you pick up the phone?
- She's too nice.

04:08.440 --> 04:09.372
I'm not gonna blow her off.

04:09.374 --> 04:11.443
I can't have that weigh
on my conscience.

04:11.811 --> 04:12.676
That's it.

04:12.678 --> 04:15.779
That's it. She's too
nice, it's creepy.

04:15.781 --> 04:18.115
She thinks we're dating
and wants to meet Tennie.

04:18.117 --> 04:21.952
Oh no, you trunk your way into her life
just to get you a huge deal on a house

04:21.954 --> 04:23.386
that's not even on the market.

04:23.388 --> 04:26.924
Daniella, come on, what are you
talking about? I'm the victim here.

04:26.926 --> 04:27.860
You need to break it off.

04:28.794 --> 04:30.694
I want to but I can't.

04:30.696 --> 04:32.897
It feels like punching a
Pomeranian in the face.

04:32.899 --> 04:37.201
Are you guys talking about
Jenny? She is such a sweetheart.

04:37.203 --> 04:38.871
She just added me on Facebook.

04:40.273 --> 04:42.940
And congratulations, they opened
the escrow, the money transferred.

04:42.942 --> 04:44.607
You are good to go.

04:44.609 --> 04:45.976
- Huh?
- Mm-Hm.

04:45.978 --> 04:47.847
All right then,
we're celebrating.

04:48.714 --> 04:50.548
Ice. I'll be right back.

04:50.983 --> 04:53.183
So, are you gonna introduce
Tennie to her tonight?

04:53.185 --> 04:56.619
- Why would I do that?
- Well, she thinks you are.

04:56.621 --> 04:59.557
- Didn't you promise her that when you got the house?
- Holy shit.

05:00.525 --> 05:01.827
I don't need ice.

05:03.461 --> 05:08.065
Twenty-four, twenty-five, twenty-six,
twenty-seven, twenty-eight, twenty-nine,

05:08.067 --> 05:09.035
thirty.

05:09.702 --> 05:10.868
- Mr. Miller.
- What?

05:10.870 --> 05:12.638
Could I give that
a try in Jessica?

05:13.839 --> 05:15.239
Keep your mouth
away from me.

05:15.241 --> 05:20.077
You guys, this
is serious stuff, okay?

05:20.079 --> 05:27.718
You need to pay attention because this...
it could save someone's life.

05:27.720 --> 05:29.286
- What the hell-Narbeh?
- So you need to look...

05:29.288 --> 05:33.624
- Yeah Narbeh, what the hell?
- What? We are childhood friends.

05:33.626 --> 05:35.761
And I'm your future wife.
Keep that in mind.

05:36.662 --> 05:39.732
- Left... hand and arm.
- Tennie. Tennie.

05:40.598 --> 05:47.605
One, two, and then
you go one, two-

05:51.077 --> 05:54.812
Anyways, I'm telling you,
you have to... who is this guy?

05:54.814 --> 05:55.646
This is Jack.

05:55.648 --> 05:57.281
I'm Jack.

05:57.283 --> 05:59.986
- Your cousin Jack?
- Yeah, the cousin Jack you asked for earlier, the Uber driver.

06:01.153 --> 06:05.255
- The cousin Jack who makes the best Long Island iced tea?
- No, that's Uncle Jack.

06:05.257 --> 06:06.890
Okay, time out.

06:06.892 --> 06:10.127
Daniella, I told you I need
someone for a week or two,

06:10.129 --> 06:13.265
not some kid auditioning for the
next <i>Fast & Furious</i> movie.

06:14.000 --> 06:15.899
How many are we at
with those anyways?

06:15.901 --> 06:17.968
- Nine, ten, eleven?
- Nineteen.

06:17.970 --> 06:18.802
Nineteen?

06:18.804 --> 06:21.739
Yes, his age.
He's 19 and family.

06:21.741 --> 06:23.209
You asked for him,
so take it or leave it.

06:24.110 --> 06:25.876
Like practically 20.

06:25.878 --> 06:28.212
And what are you willing to pay anyways? Is
this guy even worth the trouble, Daniella?

06:28.214 --> 06:30.114
He comes with the
attitude too, huh.

06:30.116 --> 06:32.184
- Come on, let's go.
- Yeah.

06:32.985 --> 06:34.584
And say hi to your Uncle Jack.

06:34.586 --> 06:37.921
Look, for my cousin's sake I just want
to let you know that I learned to drive

06:37.923 --> 06:39.723
stick at 15 from my brother.

06:39.725 --> 06:42.059
At 16, I was parking Escalades.

06:42.061 --> 06:45.796
At 17, designated human
GPS on every road trip.

06:45.798 --> 06:47.931
We are not robbing a bank, kid.

06:47.933 --> 06:52.236
I just want you to drive around
Glendale within speed limit.

06:52.238 --> 06:53.005
And?

06:54.140 --> 06:56.940
Twelve hundred for the week,
you'll be driving my car.

06:56.942 --> 06:58.142
Fourteen hundred.

06:58.144 --> 06:59.945
I'll have to stop
going to auditions.

07:00.913 --> 07:03.883
- What?
- He is also an aspiring actor.

07:05.918 --> 07:08.052
Chauffeur is the new waiter?

07:08.054 --> 07:10.721
Fourteen hundred it is
and I'll pay the difference.

07:10.723 --> 07:11.891
Now wait in the lobby.

07:12.992 --> 07:15.826
- Daniella, you're killing me.
- Can I borrow $200?

07:15.828 --> 07:17.227
Why?

07:17.229 --> 07:19.296
Well, he's family and don't you
always say that actors have to eat?

07:19.298 --> 07:21.131
Yes, you're right, absolutely.

07:21.133 --> 07:23.333
But when they're
actually acting.

07:23.335 --> 07:25.570
Look, my back, bye-bye.

07:26.238 --> 07:30.107
Sometimes I just want to shut
down because I'm so stressed up.

07:30.109 --> 07:31.542
<i>Tell me about it.</i>

07:31.544 --> 07:34.878
I'm fully convinced that the leading
cause of my migraines is my mother.

07:34.880 --> 07:37.314
Yeah, well at least you guys
can dance your troubles away.

07:37.316 --> 07:40.951
My lazy-ass stepfather can't even
change the ink in our printer.

07:40.953 --> 07:43.353
And we've had it
for seven years.

07:43.355 --> 07:44.888
<i>That's sad.</i>

07:44.890 --> 07:50.296
- Hey, Ten, you're still free to join us tonight right?
- Great, it's my dad.

07:51.831 --> 07:53.730
He needs to show me something.

07:53.732 --> 07:57.434
- Hey, who's Hamid?
- I'm sorry, who?

07:57.436 --> 07:59.336
Tennie's admirer?

07:59.338 --> 08:02.607
And how exactly
would you know that?

08:04.076 --> 08:07.612
Little old fashioned,
but I can appreciate.

08:09.882 --> 08:10.850
Thank you.

08:11.784 --> 08:12.749
Nice guy.

08:12.751 --> 08:13.986
Weird, but nice.

08:15.221 --> 08:16.155
Anyway, if I'm gonna be driving
you around for the whole week,

08:17.323 --> 08:19.225
- I get to take the car home right?
- Nope.

08:20.259 --> 08:21.692
All right, I'm here.

08:21.694 --> 08:27.331
- What's the big surprise? You got a driver?
- More like a chauffeur.

08:27.333 --> 08:29.066
Jack, meet Tennie.

08:29.068 --> 08:30.102
Tennie, meet Jack.

08:30.736 --> 08:31.403
Hi.

08:33.839 --> 08:35.305
- Enough staring.
- Okay.

08:48.154 --> 08:50.089
Dad, why
are we stopping?

08:55.427 --> 08:57.196
Tada!

08:57.897 --> 09:00.966
- What is this?
- It's your new house.

09:01.967 --> 09:04.036
- That's right.
- Can we go now?

09:04.904 --> 09:08.338
Hey, hey, hey, what's going on? Aren't
you happy? Don't you want to see inside?

09:08.340 --> 09:09.740
Sure.

09:09.742 --> 09:10.774
All right.

09:10.776 --> 09:13.810
The seller should be
here in about 20 minutes.

09:13.812 --> 09:18.982
Dad, you bought a house in Glendale,
one block away from our old house.

09:18.984 --> 09:20.250
That's awkward.

09:20.252 --> 09:26.123
What? One of the safest city in
Los Angeles, prime real estate.

09:26.125 --> 09:30.129
Look, if this is gonna take a while, I have
some assignments that I need to turn in.

09:30.763 --> 09:33.365
Can we just do the
tour later, please?

09:34.200 --> 09:36.202
Sure. Sure, sweetie.

09:37.102 --> 09:38.435
We'll do it later.

09:38.437 --> 09:40.139
Thank you for coming.

09:40.506 --> 09:44.208
Listen kid, this is a
confidentiality agreement.

09:44.210 --> 09:47.377
Oh God, what now? Are you
casting me in one of your commercials?

09:47.379 --> 09:48.512
Huh, you wish.

09:48.514 --> 09:51.215
You're an actor, right? So
pretend to be a deaf-mute.

09:51.217 --> 09:53.951
You don't say anything,
you don't hear anything.

09:53.953 --> 09:57.421
And whenever I want,
you're also blind, okay?

09:57.423 --> 10:02.428
So this quasi blind deaf mute of yours
also gets a BMW for the week, right?

10:04.530 --> 10:05.831
Fine. Jesus.

10:09.335 --> 10:11.403
She was kind of
happy today, right?

10:12.238 --> 10:16.275
Well, if that was her happy face,
remind me never to piss her off.

10:17.209 --> 10:19.311
You stay away from my daughter.

10:24.383 --> 10:27.186
Did I say you will
stay away? I did.

10:30.856 --> 10:36.026
You surprised her with a house
and all she told you was "nice?"

10:36.028 --> 10:38.095
Come on, it's her personality.

10:38.097 --> 10:42.532
Obviously, it affected you a lot
more than you thought it would.

10:42.534 --> 10:47.940
Maybe that's why you're not
ready to introduce her to me yet.

10:48.907 --> 10:50.907
Well, there is something
you should know.

10:50.909 --> 10:54.780
Robert, you can
tell me anything.

10:55.314 --> 10:57.316
All I want is for
you to be happy.

10:58.150 --> 11:01.787
People like you
deserve happiness.

11:02.388 --> 11:09.895
Jenny, it's really hard working all the time,
being a single dad, raising a teenager.

11:12.064 --> 11:16.135
Have you ever considered
seeing a therapist?

11:18.971 --> 11:22.606
Why? Paying someone to listen
to me to talk about my feelings?

11:22.608 --> 11:27.279
What's wrong with that?
I have for 14 years.

11:28.013 --> 11:31.315
I think it would bring the
two of you closer together.

11:31.317 --> 11:34.119
Fourteen years? 1-4?

11:34.887 --> 11:35.585
Wow.

11:35.587 --> 11:37.289
Basically, you're half a shrink.

11:38.223 --> 11:39.189
I guess so.

11:39.191 --> 11:42.159
Good. So another 14
years, then we'll talk.

11:42.161 --> 11:44.494
You're such a dumb bitch.

11:44.496 --> 11:48.633
Oh, please, cousins, aunts, nephews,
nieces, it's all the same shit.

11:48.635 --> 11:52.536
No. Susie is my mom's sister.

11:52.538 --> 11:54.104
That's why we're so close.

11:54.106 --> 11:58.508
Aren't you close with everyone or at
least pretend to be like with your dad?

11:58.510 --> 12:00.979
That's took years of practice.

12:04.516 --> 12:05.451
Tennie.

12:22.101 --> 12:23.435
Never with my dad.

12:24.970 --> 12:27.404
He's the one I always go to because my
mom and I butt heads over everything.

12:27.406 --> 12:31.477
Well, if you were stuck with Robert
Grigorian, you would do the same.

12:32.511 --> 12:38.215
Oh my God, did you see what Narbeh
just posted? He's such an idiot.

12:38.217 --> 12:40.384
Remember when he had
a huge crush on me?

12:40.386 --> 12:44.187
Narbeh crushes on anyone
with a chest bigger than his.

12:44.189 --> 12:45.391
So, everyone.

12:46.626 --> 12:49.027
Yeah, pretty much.
Come on, let's go.

12:54.166 --> 12:56.533
- Hi, Uncle Robert!
- Hi, Michelle!

12:56.535 --> 12:59.069
Hey, dad. I thought you were
gonna come home late tonight.

12:59.071 --> 13:02.640
Are you on your way out? I thought you
told me you're gonna stay home tonight.

13:02.642 --> 13:04.040
I changed my mind.

13:04.042 --> 13:05.710
Sorry, it was my idea.

13:05.712 --> 13:08.211
I got us tickets for a
screening for a movie.

13:08.213 --> 13:09.212
It's no huge deal.

13:09.214 --> 13:10.748
I don't have to go if
you don't want me to.

13:10.750 --> 13:13.083
No. No, it's fine. It's fine.

13:13.085 --> 13:15.085
- Do you need money?
- No, we're good.

13:15.087 --> 13:16.286
- Yeah?
- Night, Uncle Robert.

13:16.288 --> 13:17.387
Goodnight.

13:17.389 --> 13:19.158
Hey. Hey, Tennie...

13:20.325 --> 13:21.759
I know, I know.

13:21.761 --> 13:23.126
- Be safe.
- Be safe.

13:23.128 --> 13:24.196
Goodnight, dad.

13:26.131 --> 13:27.698
Michelle, be safe.

13:27.700 --> 13:29.232
Yeah, okay, I'll call
you when I get there.

13:29.234 --> 13:30.467
<i>I'm here,
I'm waiting for you.</i>

13:30.469 --> 13:32.269
Hold up. I got someone
on the other line.

13:32.271 --> 13:33.503
<i>Okay, okay, call me back.</i>

13:33.505 --> 13:35.773
- Talk to me.
- <i>Get your ass back here now.</i>

13:35.775 --> 13:37.409
- Now?
- <i>Hurry up.</i>

13:41.313 --> 13:44.247
Typical Robert, gets what
he wants when he wants it.

13:44.249 --> 13:48.552
What is it that you're looking for, mmm? We
both know you're not exactly father of the year

13:48.554 --> 13:51.488
or the decade for that matter.

13:51.490 --> 13:53.089
Thank you for the kind words.

13:53.091 --> 13:56.560
You expect to come in here and for me to
give you a full report of your daughter

13:56.562 --> 13:59.797
- over the past how many years?
- She comes to you for everything.

13:59.799 --> 14:02.134
Yes, because I'm her aunt.

14:03.202 --> 14:05.736
Look, Robert, Tennie
is a sweetheart.

14:05.738 --> 14:06.739
I know that.

14:07.339 --> 14:09.206
But she's also angry.

14:09.208 --> 14:10.775
Because she's a teenager.

14:10.777 --> 14:13.278
Oh my God, you're
just not getting it.

14:13.746 --> 14:16.046
All she has is you, Robert.

14:16.048 --> 14:21.151
And if you can't see what's broken then,
you know, I can't... I can't help you.

14:21.153 --> 14:22.118
Then don't.

14:22.120 --> 14:24.289
Because there isn't
anything broken, okay?

14:24.691 --> 14:26.726
Yeah, I wish.

14:28.393 --> 14:30.728
No one knows her
better than I do.

14:30.730 --> 14:33.766
Congratulations on
the house, Robert.

15:31.623 --> 15:34.558
Michelle, it's getting
really weird.

15:34.560 --> 15:38.595
I mean my dad's not even in his room and
there's music playing in the kitchen.

15:38.597 --> 15:39.429
Music.

15:54.647 --> 15:57.915
I haven't been able to figure
this out. A new house, now this.

15:57.917 --> 16:00.483
- I mean, really?
- Well, does it at least have a pool?

16:00.485 --> 16:03.721
I'm in the middle of a crisis right now and
all you can think about is getting a tan?

16:03.723 --> 16:06.423
What? First Jason, now your dad.

16:06.425 --> 16:09.225
I'm just trying to make the
best out of a bad situation.

16:09.227 --> 16:11.229
Might as well put on
your vengeance style.

16:11.798 --> 16:14.399
- <i>I guess so.</i>
- That's my girl.

16:17.336 --> 16:20.270
- Good morning.
- Good morning. Good morning.

16:20.272 --> 16:22.505
- Going to school?
- Every day, dad.

16:22.507 --> 16:25.876
- Breakfast.
- No, I don't do breakfast.

16:25.878 --> 16:27.011
I used to be like you.

16:27.013 --> 16:29.714
- Yeah.
- But one day we'll give breakfast a try.

16:29.716 --> 16:32.683
Sure, dad, one day.

16:32.685 --> 16:33.585
Be safe.

16:34.219 --> 16:35.820
Don't do anything I would do.

16:35.822 --> 16:39.157
Like what? Get a random
urge to buy a house?

16:39.591 --> 16:43.661
This time across the street? Or,
you know, I have a better idea.

16:43.663 --> 16:46.398
How about get my license
suspended just like you?

16:49.401 --> 16:50.533
- Yeah.
- Good one.

16:50.535 --> 16:51.570
Thank you.

17:04.282 --> 17:07.852
- Hi, Tennie, how was your morning?
- It just started.

17:07.854 --> 17:10.288
Oh, I knew that.

17:10.890 --> 17:14.792
Hey, I'm just to let you know and I don't want
to bring this up again in case you get upset

17:14.794 --> 17:19.229
but what Jason did was really horrible,
and it's about karma, you know.

17:19.231 --> 17:19.899
What are you gonna do?

17:20.499 --> 17:21.899
Hamid.

17:21.901 --> 17:24.401
Hey, I just... I just want you to
know that I'm... I'm here for you.

17:24.403 --> 17:26.369
It's not like we mean
it or anything like that.

17:26.371 --> 17:28.005
I mean you're Wonder Woman
and I'm like Steve Trevor.

17:28.007 --> 17:31.911
Hamid, that's really sweet but I...
I think I know how to handle it.

17:34.546 --> 17:37.380
All right, Tennie, no bullshit,
just tell me the truth.

17:37.382 --> 17:40.250
- Is there anything going on between you and Narbeh?
- What?

17:40.252 --> 17:43.486
- Is there anything going on now?
- Are you serious? No.

17:43.488 --> 17:46.691
I need to know if there is or if there will
ever be anything going on between you two.

17:46.693 --> 17:50.462
Or what, Anna? You're gonna sue me with
that future Harvard law degree of yours?

17:51.030 --> 17:55.567
Don't worry, your dreams of white
picket fences and butterflies are safe.

17:58.403 --> 17:59.604
Ugh!

18:00.773 --> 18:04.842
Inhale, exhale. Inhale.

18:04.844 --> 18:07.310
Do I have to teach
you people everything?

18:07.312 --> 18:09.647
Your gluten-free fried dumplings
are on their way.

18:09.649 --> 18:12.650
Why is it taking so long?
Is it coming from China?

18:12.652 --> 18:15.019
I don't know why you have
called me, what's going on?

18:15.021 --> 18:17.389
Oh, Robert, thank you
for finally being here.

18:17.824 --> 18:21.524
- What the hell is going on?
- Ask your sister. Marcus is fuming.

18:21.526 --> 18:23.027
Okay, get him some
valium or something.

18:23.029 --> 18:25.629
Oh, sorry, it's my drug
dealer's day off today.

18:25.631 --> 18:27.898
Huh, good one. Now go. Bye.

18:27.900 --> 18:29.967
Hi, brother. Oh, hello sister.

18:29.969 --> 18:32.435
Thank you so much
for bringing the kid.

18:32.437 --> 18:34.537
Oh, I love you so much, sister.

18:34.539 --> 18:36.541
I love you, too, brother.

18:36.909 --> 18:38.042
Is she okay?

18:38.044 --> 18:42.046
Excuse me, are you
the chauffeur? U-turn.

18:42.048 --> 18:46.784
What the hell is going on? Who is this kid?
Stop forcing your ideas on my directors.

18:46.786 --> 18:47.752
Oh my God.

18:47.754 --> 18:49.653
Now I see where Tennie
gets her attitude from.

18:49.655 --> 18:52.422
What? Stop changing
the subject, that's my job.

18:52.424 --> 18:55.358
Francine here is my fortune
teller's kid, okay?

18:55.360 --> 18:57.630
And don't worry, I got all the
release form taken care of.

18:58.363 --> 18:59.766
What do you think of her?

19:01.466 --> 19:02.767
She's nice.

19:02.769 --> 19:05.435
Good. Her name is Rita.
She makes four hundred thousand a year.

19:05.437 --> 19:09.405
Sunday bring Tennie over to my house and I
arrange for you two to meet for dinner, huh?

19:09.407 --> 19:10.841
No, thank you.

19:10.843 --> 19:13.476
Why not? Robert,
it's been five years.

19:13.478 --> 19:15.478
We already talked about this.

19:15.480 --> 19:18.716
- I said no, thank you, okay?
- Plus, I never get to see my niece.

19:18.718 --> 19:22.853
You let her spend too much time with the
other side of the family that sweet Susie.

19:22.855 --> 19:24.420
It's not fair.

19:24.422 --> 19:27.490
You know what's not fair? You sticking
your nose in people's personal lives

19:27.492 --> 19:29.459
and becoming center
of attention and wondering

19:29.461 --> 19:31.629
why people choose
to stay away from you,

19:31.631 --> 19:35.800
not to mention missing all the PTA
meetings I asked you to attend.

19:35.802 --> 19:38.434
- Sis.
- So? When are we going to surprise Tennie

19:38.436 --> 19:41.038
- with the new house?
- About that-

19:41.040 --> 19:44.975
What do you mean about that? No,
no, you told me I'll be there.

19:44.977 --> 19:47.978
- You said I am going to be there to surprise Tennie.
- What's going on?

19:47.980 --> 19:50.082
Armenians, very
passionate people.

19:50.983 --> 19:51.782
I see.

19:51.784 --> 19:52.783
- I love you.
- I'm gonna be there.

19:52.785 --> 19:54.352
Yeah man, we got this.

19:56.155 --> 19:57.489
Hold this.

19:59.692 --> 20:01.591
Who did this to my car?

20:01.593 --> 20:04.427
Oh my... Fuck. Come on.

20:04.429 --> 20:05.430
Let's go.

20:11.938 --> 20:13.840
- Hi, Uncle Robert.
- Hi.

20:17.475 --> 20:20.543
- Hello.
- Hello. Mr. Grigorian, please take a seat.

20:20.545 --> 20:21.513
Thank you.

20:22.014 --> 20:23.716
Dad, I didn't do anything.

20:24.784 --> 20:25.548
Okay.

20:25.550 --> 20:27.854
This is a very
serious situation.

20:28.955 --> 20:33.491
This is a car of one of our
students, Jason Bourne.

20:34.627 --> 20:37.460
- Are you serious?
- Yes, Mr. Grigorian.

20:37.462 --> 20:42.099
- Is that his real name? Bourne.
- Yes, it's his real name.

20:42.101 --> 20:43.300
Okay.

20:43.302 --> 20:47.470
We don't tolerate vandalism
of any kind at this school.

20:47.472 --> 20:49.141
Dad, I was in study hall.

20:49.909 --> 20:53.610
- I promise.
- Tennie, we have witnesses that place you near the car

20:53.612 --> 20:55.112
just prior to the incident.

20:55.114 --> 20:57.948
I'm sorry but what is
that supposed to mean?

20:57.950 --> 21:01.719
I'm concerned that if we
don't find a resolution today

21:01.721 --> 21:04.221
there may be consequences
beyond the school.

21:04.223 --> 21:06.792
So you're saying no one
else might have done it?

21:07.559 --> 21:09.326
I mean, it's a big school right?

21:09.328 --> 21:14.031
Mr. Grigorian, it's come to my attention that
there's a prior history between these students.

21:14.033 --> 21:14.999
Hmm.

21:15.001 --> 21:18.669
So retaliation is not
out of the question.

21:18.671 --> 21:20.006
It has nothing to do with it.

21:21.774 --> 21:27.046
Mr. Grigorian, Jason's family is a major
supporter of both our school and the district.

21:27.612 --> 21:31.583
If they choose to take legal action, I
am afraid I won't be able to support you.

21:32.885 --> 21:34.084
Thank you very much.

21:34.086 --> 21:36.754
I really understand
and I appreciate.

21:36.756 --> 21:37.821
- So how much?
- Dad!

21:37.823 --> 21:40.124
Mr. Grigorian, I'm not sure
what you had in mind

21:40.126 --> 21:41.994
but that is not how
we do business here.

21:43.229 --> 21:46.065
- May I use your pen?
- Dad.

21:46.899 --> 21:48.632
I'm trying to be supportive.

21:48.634 --> 21:49.035
Yeah?

21:51.103 --> 21:53.837
Tennie. Tennie. Tennie.

21:53.839 --> 21:55.074
Dad, what is it?

21:56.842 --> 22:01.245
What do you want from me? You already told me
over there that you're disappointed in me.

22:01.247 --> 22:03.814
I just want to know
about this Jason guy.

22:03.816 --> 22:06.684
I mean you don't believe
me anyway, so why bother?

22:06.686 --> 22:09.153
- Mr. Grigorian, Jason...
- Shut up, Narbeh.

22:09.155 --> 22:12.756
Tennie, I just paid $2,000 for damages
and you're lucky I convinced them

22:12.758 --> 22:14.792
to only give you a Saturday
morning detention.

22:14.794 --> 22:18.197
Why did you do that? I already
told you I didn't key the car.

22:18.864 --> 22:19.932
I did it!

22:21.067 --> 22:21.934
Hamid?

22:22.635 --> 22:24.502
Hold on a second. You're Hamid?

22:24.870 --> 22:27.071
See, Narbeh?
That kid's got balls.

22:27.073 --> 22:28.808
It wasn't fair what
happened to Tennie.

22:29.742 --> 22:31.077
I couldn't take it anymore.

22:32.577 --> 22:32.979
And?

22:43.823 --> 22:46.589
Yeah, I don't think that
kid's got two grand.

22:46.591 --> 22:49.293
Satisfied? Can I go now?

22:49.295 --> 22:50.728
Yes.

22:50.730 --> 22:51.697
Case closed.

22:53.866 --> 22:55.432
I'll make it up to you.

22:55.434 --> 22:59.703
Mr. Grigorian, I don't know if this
is the right time to give this to you

22:59.705 --> 23:02.873
but this is the reel I
asked Tennie to show you.

23:02.875 --> 23:05.778
I would love to get into
directing and production.

23:06.312 --> 23:07.680
I'm sure you do.

23:09.682 --> 23:10.748
Hurry up.

23:10.750 --> 23:12.349
Okay, we'll talk.

23:12.351 --> 23:15.821
Oh, hey, man, could you do me a huge
favor and make sure he takes a look at it?

23:16.621 --> 23:18.288
- Yeah.
- Where the hell have you been?

23:18.290 --> 23:20.758
I've been waiting for
you for four minutes.

23:20.760 --> 23:22.527
Anna, there's a situation here.

23:22.928 --> 23:25.197
What? The Tennie-Jason thing?

23:25.765 --> 23:28.766
Well, if what he said wasn't true,
she wouldn't key his car, would she?

23:28.768 --> 23:30.200
Right, but she didn't.

23:30.202 --> 23:31.235
Hold on.

23:31.237 --> 23:33.904
- Who is this guy?
- Some guy Tennie slept with.

23:33.906 --> 23:35.939
Anna, that's a lie
and you know it.

23:35.941 --> 23:39.609
What? That she didn't sleep with him?
Or that she wasn't even good?

23:39.611 --> 23:41.945
That's just some
bullshit rumor. Stop it.

23:41.947 --> 23:43.080
Wow.

23:43.082 --> 23:46.318
So this Jason guy, I mean
does he live around here?

23:48.020 --> 23:48.986
Huh?

23:48.988 --> 23:51.255
Out of everyone who
would have done this,

23:51.257 --> 23:53.657
- who would have thought it'd be Hamid?
- Yeah.

23:53.659 --> 23:57.694
- And didn't he also write you a letter?
- Yeah, an actual letter.

23:57.696 --> 24:02.299
- But to key a car?
- Well, people do crazy things when they are in love.

24:02.301 --> 24:03.934
Shut up.

24:03.936 --> 24:08.172
And on top of it, this whole thing with
my dad, it's honestly so embarrassing.

24:08.174 --> 24:11.408
Well, only a few more
months, then college.

24:11.410 --> 24:12.476
That's true.

24:12.478 --> 24:14.246
By the way, have you heard
back from Berkeley yet?

24:16.282 --> 24:17.347
No, not yet.

24:17.349 --> 24:19.416
Thinking of going for a
campus visit this weekend.

24:19.418 --> 24:22.052
- Hmm.
- My cousin who's there said I could stay with her.

24:22.054 --> 24:25.823
Plus, I have been chatting online
with someone who goes there.

24:25.825 --> 24:28.258
Oh, you sly, you never
mentioned him before.

24:28.260 --> 24:30.094
- Who is he?
- Nothing serious.

24:30.096 --> 24:31.929
I'll let you know
when I figure out more.

24:31.931 --> 24:33.997
Fine. But I'm
gonna want details.

24:33.999 --> 24:35.799
There you go.

24:35.801 --> 24:36.599
Hello?

24:36.601 --> 24:39.103
- What's up?
- Where are you guys?

24:39.105 --> 24:42.106
Narbeh is staring at your cousin
like a creepy stalker again.

24:42.108 --> 24:43.042
<i>Again?</i>

24:43.876 --> 24:45.644
I swear to God,
I'm gonna kill him.

24:46.312 --> 24:50.180
I saw this today and it
just screamed Robert's.

24:50.182 --> 24:54.785
- Perfect for an honest, humble-
- No.

24:54.787 --> 24:58.355
sensitive family man.

24:58.357 --> 25:00.090
Please stop.

25:00.092 --> 25:02.726
So how long until
the escrow closes?

25:02.728 --> 25:04.895
It's only been a couple of days.

25:04.897 --> 25:06.363
That's good. Good.

25:06.365 --> 25:08.300
Don't worry, it's a sure thing.

25:11.971 --> 25:15.941
- What's the matter, hon? Did something happen?
- Nope.

25:17.243 --> 25:22.012
Robert, the first step to solving a
problem is admitting that there is one.

25:22.014 --> 25:24.214
Huh, sorry.

25:24.216 --> 25:26.652
It's Tennie, isn't it?

25:28.087 --> 25:33.959
Maybe you should just hit pause on
everything and spend all your time with her.

25:37.796 --> 25:39.463
That's a great idea.

25:39.465 --> 25:42.232
I mean that's a
great idea, really.

25:42.234 --> 25:43.400
I should.

25:43.402 --> 25:46.805
There is nothing that you and I

25:47.373 --> 25:48.374
can't handle.

25:53.212 --> 25:54.213
One more, please.

25:55.214 --> 25:57.014
- Double shot.
- Hey, Jen.

25:57.016 --> 25:58.217
- Hey.
- It's been a while.

25:59.752 --> 26:01.954
- See you at the birthday party in a couple of weeks?
- Looking forward to it.

26:05.057 --> 26:08.894
Robert, do you think
about your past very often?

26:10.329 --> 26:13.999
I am more concerned
about the present, I would say.

26:14.533 --> 26:18.470
If you really listen to her,
you'll know what makes her happy.

26:25.277 --> 26:27.844
3 Series,
beautiful car.

26:27.846 --> 26:33.083
This car is the full package, all the options,
moon roof, navigation, sport suspension,

26:33.085 --> 26:35.319
even a limited
edition sunset orange.

26:35.321 --> 26:38.190
- Beautiful.
- You know she's not good with surprises, right?

26:40.092 --> 26:42.328
You know Uber hires
other actors, right?

26:43.529 --> 26:45.798
Sunset orange, it's beautiful.

26:46.232 --> 26:48.300
Your daughter's gonna
love this car, Robert.

26:49.101 --> 26:49.900
All right.

26:49.902 --> 26:53.203
Ah, anything for
my favorite niece.

26:53.205 --> 26:56.106
Look guys, if you need
anything, let me know.

26:56.108 --> 26:57.276
Thank you.

26:58.377 --> 26:59.343
I don't know what to do.

26:59.345 --> 27:01.347
Gotta find a way to
break it off with Anna.

27:03.582 --> 27:08.185
Ladies, there are no bad ideas?
I would literally take anything right now.

27:08.187 --> 27:12.389
Seriously, Narbeh? Haven't you broken
up with her like five times already?

27:12.391 --> 27:14.925
I know. I know. She
doesn't seem to get it.

27:14.927 --> 27:17.261
No, you idiot, you don't get it.

27:17.263 --> 27:20.163
You helped her with her art projects,
you painted her a new bedroom.

27:20.165 --> 27:23.002
Jesus Christ, you're friends
with her parents on Facebook.

27:23.869 --> 27:26.603
- So what? I can't be a nice guy now?
- It's not about that.

27:26.605 --> 27:29.539
I mean you put it in her head
that you're this perfect boyfriend

27:29.541 --> 27:32.142
and you misled her every
single step of the way.

27:32.144 --> 27:34.945
And you're giving her hope for a
future you don't even believe in.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.447
All right, all right. Are you
talking to me or Jason?

27:37.449 --> 27:40.951
- Ouch!
- Look, forget about him.

27:40.953 --> 27:44.254
- Who was that guy with your dad today?
- Oh yeah, he was cute.

27:44.256 --> 27:47.625
- What's his story?
- Some guy my dad just hired.

27:47.627 --> 27:49.926
No stories. And please
don't start with one.

27:49.928 --> 27:53.897
Yeah, I mean you already have five guys
waiting to hear from you about prom.

27:53.899 --> 27:56.168
Besides, I'm sorry, that
guy was kind of weird.

27:56.535 --> 28:00.270
- What do you mean?
- Well, after you guys left, he was talking to me.

28:00.272 --> 28:02.239
He started asking about Jason.

28:02.241 --> 28:03.842
Well, what did you say?

28:05.010 --> 28:06.209
Nothing.

28:06.211 --> 28:07.781
I didn't say anything.

28:17.556 --> 28:19.058
Hey, call it.

28:28.901 --> 28:33.470
Students, future
art connoisseurs.

28:33.472 --> 28:37.574
Today we discuss
the fundamentals of art.

28:37.576 --> 28:40.479
What does it all
mean? What does it-

28:44.049 --> 28:45.050
Dah!

28:46.585 --> 28:47.586
Hmm.

28:48.220 --> 28:50.889
Tennie, you're leaving.

28:53.192 --> 28:56.126
The principal would
like to see you.

28:56.128 --> 28:57.463
Oooh.

29:02.067 --> 29:03.102
That should do it.

29:03.502 --> 29:04.436
Yep.

29:05.070 --> 29:06.303
Good job.

29:06.305 --> 29:07.871
Thanks.

29:07.873 --> 29:12.943
So you were parked and then this 90 years
old woman trying to get into her car

29:12.945 --> 29:17.047
broke the side mirror with her oxygen
tank and you didn't even notice?

29:17.049 --> 29:18.181
Yeah.

29:18.183 --> 29:20.651
- Robert, why would I lie to you?
- Well-

29:20.653 --> 29:21.987
Okay, look, all right.

29:22.988 --> 29:24.022
Look what I got.

29:24.590 --> 29:26.156
Japanese scotch.

29:26.158 --> 29:27.991
They say it's one of the best.

29:27.993 --> 29:31.029
- What is it, your insurance policy?
- Yeah, call it a deductible.

29:32.231 --> 29:36.168
- How old are you?
- Don't worry about it, I got my sources.

29:37.269 --> 29:39.438
I do worry, Jack.

29:41.306 --> 29:42.274
Thank you.

29:44.009 --> 29:46.744
Here's the check your father
wrote to the Bourne family.

29:46.746 --> 29:49.747
Jason thinks there's no
reason to escalate this.

29:49.749 --> 29:55.385
Now, Tennie, you are one of the best in the class
and you have a bright future ahead of you.

29:55.387 --> 29:56.754
Make me proud.

29:56.756 --> 29:58.257
Thank you so much.

30:10.670 --> 30:11.603
Hey!

30:13.740 --> 30:14.506
Tennie.

30:16.676 --> 30:18.143
Tennie.

30:18.577 --> 30:19.712
Tennie!

30:20.379 --> 30:21.545
Tennie.

30:21.547 --> 30:22.649
I can't hear you.

30:31.457 --> 30:32.522
Hey.

30:32.524 --> 30:33.658
Hi, Tennie.

30:33.660 --> 30:34.725
Yeah.

30:34.727 --> 30:38.094
I'm sorry for what I did,
but I had my reasons.

30:38.096 --> 30:42.401
Hamid, you could have at least given me a heads
up so I could tell you how stupid it was.

30:44.236 --> 30:46.338
But it was very brave.

30:47.139 --> 30:49.306
Really? Thanks.

30:49.308 --> 30:52.275
- Did you get a chance to read the letter I wrote you?
- No.

30:52.277 --> 30:55.280
Hamid, I didn't,
and I probably won't.

30:56.482 --> 31:02.486
Honestly, you are a great guy and
I do love you but as a friend.

31:04.824 --> 31:07.825
I think the thing that I appreciate
most about our friendship

31:07.827 --> 31:10.060
is the respect we have towards
each other, you know.

31:10.062 --> 31:12.529
- But what if we could develop that into something?
- No.

31:12.531 --> 31:16.634
Hamid, look, we come from two different
worlds, two different cultures.

31:16.636 --> 31:19.402
- I mean starting from the foods
we--What does that matter?

31:19.404 --> 31:25.408
Hamid, my dad once told my cousin that
in the wild a giraffe has a baby giraffe

31:25.410 --> 31:29.714
and an elephant has a baby elephant,
but you never see a baby giraffe

31:29.716 --> 31:32.518
and a baby elephant
try to, you know...

31:34.119 --> 31:37.387
Shit, that's kind
of racist, huh.

31:37.389 --> 31:38.522
A little bit.

31:38.524 --> 31:40.590
I love Thai food.

31:40.592 --> 31:42.760
Me, too, but 'm on a diet.

31:42.762 --> 31:45.730
Robert, where have you been?
I need you to look at something.

31:45.732 --> 31:49.634
- What is it?
- Well, we have a new rough cut for the commercial.

31:49.636 --> 31:50.467
Mm-Hm.

31:50.469 --> 31:53.105
But we don't have
the product yet.

31:53.773 --> 31:54.439
All right.

31:55.541 --> 31:57.507
<i>The perfect walk.</i>

31:57.509 --> 31:59.476
<i>The wonderful friends.</i>

31:59.478 --> 32:01.411
<i>The magical kiss.</i>

32:01.413 --> 32:03.480
<i>And then this.</i>

32:03.482 --> 32:07.787
<i>What could be missing
all this time? Trust. Love.</i>

32:08.353 --> 32:10.088
<i>Dino Tention for Men.</i>

32:11.189 --> 32:13.256
Wow, that is wonderful.

32:13.258 --> 32:17.762
- It's really good, isn't it?
- This is the worst tagline that I've ever heard.

32:17.764 --> 32:19.296
It was your idea.

32:19.298 --> 32:20.232
Was it?

32:21.634 --> 32:25.870
First step to solving any problem
is admitting that there is one.

32:25.872 --> 32:28.238
- That's deep.
- Mm-Hm.

32:28.240 --> 32:29.640
Who have you
decided to go with at the prom?

32:29.642 --> 32:33.579
I don't know yet. There is...
Okay, there is five guys.

32:34.681 --> 32:35.780
One of them is cute

32:35.782 --> 32:38.548
and then the other one
just has a nice personality.

32:38.550 --> 32:42.753
It's just that there are five people
and I want my prom to be perfect.

32:42.755 --> 32:44.689
And I need the
perfect date for us.

32:44.691 --> 32:46.222
Just pick
the most attractive one.

32:46.224 --> 32:49.760
Oh my God! You lucky bitch.

32:49.762 --> 32:51.929
My favorite car and
my favorite color, too?

32:51.931 --> 32:53.831
I swear, Michelle, if you say
one more freaking word.

32:53.833 --> 32:56.466
- Looks like she's very excited.
- She's gonna love it.

32:56.468 --> 32:59.837
- You don't be excited, okay?
- Okay.

32:59.839 --> 33:01.340
Yeah, come on.

33:02.474 --> 33:04.176
Ta-da!

33:05.912 --> 33:07.044
What is this?

33:07.046 --> 33:10.614
It's a surprise to my beautiful,
amazing, smart Tennie.

33:10.616 --> 33:12.282
You deserve it, sweetheart.

33:12.284 --> 33:14.519
You really
shouldn't have.

33:15.320 --> 33:18.758
Come on, enough of
driving that old car, okay?

33:19.424 --> 33:23.728
- But why?
- Tennie, it's the ultimate driving machine.

33:23.730 --> 33:27.197
- Practically everyone in Glendale drives one, right?
- Yeah.

33:27.199 --> 33:28.198
You're not from Glendale.

33:28.200 --> 33:32.337
That's nice, but you never
bothered to ask me.

33:33.372 --> 33:35.908
- Ask you? Ask you what?
- I like Saab.

33:36.943 --> 33:40.680
Saab? Do they even make
those cars anymore?

33:41.613 --> 33:43.246
Let's go, Michelle.

33:43.248 --> 33:47.818
Tennie. Tennie. Tennie, would you please
at least give it a try? Test-drive it.

33:47.820 --> 33:51.421
I mean it's the least we could do,
your dad went through all this trouble.

33:51.423 --> 33:52.790
Just my opinion.

33:52.792 --> 33:56.526
You know what, Dad?
You're right, let me give it a test drive.

33:56.528 --> 34:00.733
- I mean it's the ultimate driving machine, right?
- Yes.

34:01.533 --> 34:04.771
- How fast does it go?
- The speed limit...

34:06.773 --> 34:08.407
I think Jack
should go with him.

34:09.742 --> 34:12.277
- What?
- For safety.

34:13.512 --> 34:15.648
I don't... I don't think
that's a good idea.

34:16.749 --> 34:19.315
You know what?
I think it's a great idea.

34:19.317 --> 34:19.952
Let's go.

34:21.821 --> 34:27.357
- Okay. Jack, be safe.
- No, we'll take my car.

34:27.359 --> 34:30.930
What? Your car? You
wanna test drive with your car?

34:31.530 --> 34:32.832
But why?

34:34.033 --> 34:37.367
Robert, you want me to find you
a family therapist for research?

34:37.369 --> 34:39.602
Yes, it's called consulting.

34:39.604 --> 34:40.971
<i>Oh,
right, consulting.</i>

34:40.973 --> 34:42.205
I get it.

34:42.207 --> 34:44.775
Are you talking about the new
client from Brazil or Peru?

34:44.777 --> 34:48.311
Robert, I know you. You never
consulted with anyone your entire life.

34:48.313 --> 34:50.883
Just book me an appointment
ASAP, okay?

34:51.516 --> 34:55.318
Daniella, you know what?
That's why you're still single.

34:55.320 --> 34:56.854
- Bye.
- <i>Robert.</i>

34:56.856 --> 34:57.790
Robert.

35:02.895 --> 35:05.328
Ask her if she talked to the
guy. How about my tattoo?

35:05.330 --> 35:07.631
- It's my mom.
- Oh, shit. I thought it was Laura.

35:07.633 --> 35:10.901
- She is on the other line.
- Your aunt is so nice she just gave this to me.

35:10.903 --> 35:13.704
- Credit cards only for emergencies.
- Welcome to my entourage.

35:13.706 --> 35:15.806
Funny, just like your dad.

35:15.808 --> 35:18.642
Please don't ever
compare me to my dad.

35:18.644 --> 35:25.617
Sorry, my bad, I'm just... just saying
you're smart and witty, passionate.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.383
You're cool.

35:27.385 --> 35:31.421
- Wait, you see all of that in my dad?
- Yeah.

35:31.423 --> 35:37.527
I mean he's got an extra element of
douchiness but I like it, it suits him.

35:37.529 --> 35:40.332
Is that how you handle him? It
takes a douche to deal with him.

35:41.801 --> 35:46.271
- You are just full of compliments today, aren't you?
- Every day.

35:48.473 --> 35:51.010
So was that my
dad's idea or yours?

35:51.978 --> 35:55.815
So, what'd I miss?
Oh, shit, is that Jason?

35:56.849 --> 35:58.450
I don't know what
you're talking about.

35:58.985 --> 36:01.384
Whoever did this
deserves a medal.

36:01.386 --> 36:02.887
Last chance.

36:02.889 --> 36:05.421
Look, I don't know what's going on
in that pretty little head of yours,

36:05.423 --> 36:09.660
but I don't know what your dad's up to, all
right? I'm on a need-to-know basis only.

36:09.662 --> 36:11.095
What is that supposed to mean?

36:11.097 --> 36:14.131
What, you signed some sort of
confidentiality agreement or something?

36:14.133 --> 36:18.434
Seriously? Do I look like someone
who keeps things confidential?

36:18.436 --> 36:21.571
That's a shame 'cause no one's
ever stood up for me like that.

36:21.573 --> 36:25.544
- Didn't I say from day one we should kick this guy's ass?
- It's not a bad idea.

36:36.856 --> 36:38.925
Nice. Nice.

36:40.126 --> 36:42.592
Thank you. Thank you
again for seeing me.

36:42.594 --> 36:44.460
Sure, no problem.

36:44.462 --> 36:45.530
Okay.

36:47.867 --> 36:49.769
Now, how do we do this?

36:50.670 --> 36:53.003
Well, you wanted me
as a consultant.

36:53.005 --> 36:54.571
Tell me about your project.

36:54.573 --> 36:57.109
- What area could I be of use?
- Okay,

36:59.011 --> 37:03.481
I tell you, it's about a single
dad and his 17-year-old daughter.

37:04.016 --> 37:05.084
Okay. And?

37:06.351 --> 37:11.155
And, well, it's about a client
of mine, basically, a friend.

37:11.157 --> 37:15.127
Yes, I will say a friend who
has problem with his daughter.

37:16.796 --> 37:17.862
Okay.

37:17.864 --> 37:21.098
So what exactly is the
conflict between you two?

37:21.100 --> 37:23.566
Oh, no, no, no, no, not me.

37:23.568 --> 37:25.638
I said my client friend.

37:26.172 --> 37:27.938
My apologies.

37:27.940 --> 37:33.644
Before we continue, I should say that a family
therapist is here to help resolve issues

37:33.646 --> 37:36.146
with no judgment, no biases.

37:36.148 --> 37:39.183
Whatever is said here
doesn't leave the room.

37:39.185 --> 37:40.418
That's the law.

37:40.920 --> 37:42.319
Okay. Now it's up to you.

37:42.321 --> 37:47.727
Are we talking about your client,
your friend or perhaps yourself?

37:49.527 --> 37:50.661
Hmm.

37:50.663 --> 37:55.067
- So, $400 an hour?
- Fifty minutes.

37:55.635 --> 37:57.968
Ah, it hurts.

37:57.970 --> 38:00.104
One, two, three four,

38:00.106 --> 38:04.607
and one, two, three, four,
one, two, three, four,

38:04.609 --> 38:06.176
- one, two, three-
- Yeah.

38:06.178 --> 38:08.846
- four, and one.
- Laura, that's the tattoo I want.

38:08.848 --> 38:12.082
- I mean, can your guy do it?
- Four, one, two, three-

38:12.084 --> 38:14.619
I would pay whatever
it costs, I don't care.

38:14.987 --> 38:16.552
I just really want that tattoo.

38:16.554 --> 38:17.487
Three, four and one.

38:17.489 --> 38:21.491
One, two, three, four.

38:21.493 --> 38:23.093
Stop the music!

38:23.095 --> 38:26.997
Stop filming me, you're getting
in my way and making me nervous.

38:26.999 --> 38:29.233
Narbeh,
get your ass over here.

38:29.235 --> 38:31.869
You girls don't appreciate
my friendship.

38:31.871 --> 38:34.638
I'm trying to capture your
talent for the big screen.

38:34.640 --> 38:39.109
If Anna finds out that I'm here and not filming
her campaign video for a school president

38:39.111 --> 38:42.048
or whatever that is,
I am screwed.

38:42.782 --> 38:44.748
Here's your appreciation.
Now shut up.

38:44.750 --> 38:47.751
Oh my God! Please
tell me there's more.

38:47.753 --> 38:49.221
I gotta make a calendar.

38:49.789 --> 38:51.655
- A calendar?
- What?

38:51.657 --> 38:52.856
Disgusting.

38:52.858 --> 38:54.660
You see it's not
a big deal, right?

38:56.362 --> 39:02.666
Well, after hearing what you've had to say
so far, as a consultant for your project,

39:02.668 --> 39:05.601
I would tell you that a
teenager needs attention.

39:05.603 --> 39:10.674
By not having both parents around and by being
raised by mainly extended family members,

39:10.676 --> 39:14.612
it would suggest that the remaining parent
take a more active role in the child's life.

39:15.547 --> 39:17.547
That's right, you are correct.

39:17.549 --> 39:20.518
But if I was your
family therapist,

39:21.287 --> 39:27.059
I would say that your teenage daughter at
this point needs a father and not a friend.

39:29.662 --> 39:32.865
I get it, you're right,
absolutely.

39:33.598 --> 39:35.234
Father, not a friend.

39:36.202 --> 39:36.802
I get it.

39:37.636 --> 39:39.703
But I wanna be your friend.

39:39.705 --> 39:41.805
Dad, that's not how this works.

39:41.807 --> 39:43.974
- Why not?
- I don't know.

39:43.976 --> 39:47.277
Okay, I'm just saying,
all right? Just think about it.

39:47.279 --> 39:48.114
Hey.

39:49.581 --> 39:51.917
Friends forever, huh?

39:53.352 --> 39:54.651
Okay, dad.

39:54.653 --> 39:57.187
But this never happened.

39:57.189 --> 39:58.057
Never.

39:58.724 --> 40:00.259
Call me later, okay?

40:01.827 --> 40:06.063
Tennie, my wonderful,
beautiful, one-of-a-kind niece.

40:06.065 --> 40:10.334
I miss you so much, my Tennie.

40:10.336 --> 40:14.238
Listen, what's going on?
You don't call, you don't text,

40:14.240 --> 40:16.707
you don't spend the night
at my house anymore, huh.

40:16.709 --> 40:18.108
I'm sorry.

40:18.110 --> 40:20.210
But it's okay 'cause
I love you so much.

40:20.212 --> 40:21.278
Tennie, I love you.

40:21.280 --> 40:24.250
Wait, look, what I've got
for your new car, huh.

40:25.017 --> 40:27.217
- Ta-da!
- Oh God.

40:27.219 --> 40:28.085
Thank you.

40:28.087 --> 40:29.653
- Sweet.
- You like it?

40:29.655 --> 40:33.123
- I do, I do. Thank you.
- Listen, this is a traditional handmade evil eye, okay.

40:33.125 --> 40:35.292
You hang it in your car
and it will keep you safe.

40:35.294 --> 40:38.395
- Oh, and for extra safety...
- Thank you.

40:38.397 --> 40:41.634
Excuse me, is there one
more to keep you away?

40:42.268 --> 40:43.634
Hi, Robert.

40:43.636 --> 40:46.036
Listen, pick a date, we're gonna
go shopping for your prom dress.

40:46.038 --> 40:47.671
It's on me, non-negotiable.

40:47.673 --> 40:51.141
Hold on a second, what dress? Prom dress?
There is a prom? When? I'm buying it.

40:51.143 --> 40:53.110
- Okay?
- Hello, hello, I said non-negotiable.

40:53.112 --> 40:55.245
You already got her
a car and a house.

40:55.247 --> 40:57.615
I love you so much,
but I gotta go.

40:58.050 --> 40:59.283
I love you, too.

40:59.285 --> 41:01.351
- Spending the night at Laura's.
- Yeah.

41:01.353 --> 41:04.021
Wait, wait, who's Laura?
I don't know any Laura.

41:04.023 --> 41:05.324
Is she Armenian?

41:06.466 --> 41:08.299
You are seriously sick!

41:08.301 --> 41:09.219
Oh, speaking of sick...

41:09.428 --> 41:12.129
Look what I've got for you.
Three more ladies, okay.

41:12.131 --> 41:13.330
Lady number one.

41:13.332 --> 41:14.900
- Seriously?
- Lady number two.

41:18.270 --> 41:22.039
- Hey.
- So thanks for signing the documents I forgot.

41:22.041 --> 41:24.007
Oh, no problem.

41:24.009 --> 41:26.145
So, Indian for dinner
tomorrow night?

41:27.346 --> 41:30.783
Oh, yeah, spicy but yeah.

41:33.119 --> 41:35.054
- Thank you.
- Bye.

41:36.455 --> 41:38.324
God, I love this guy.

41:40.726 --> 41:43.961

Perfect for Ronnie ♪</i>

41:43.963 --> 41:47.164

41:47.166 --> 41:50.300
<i>♪ This spot would have been

<i>♪ But now he's nothing

41:54.306 --> 41:57.441
- Who's getting popped?
- Undercover Arnie.

41:57.443 --> 41:59.943
- Who's getting popped?
- Johnny Toodos?

41:59.945 --> 42:01.881
You're right, Arnie, pop-pop.

42:02.781 --> 42:06.183
- Oh my God!
- What do you know? She's just a regular gal.

42:06.185 --> 42:09.153
Yes, but I do know who
the undercover cop is.

42:10.556 --> 42:13.824
All right, let's put it to a vote
and pop whoever's most suspicious.

42:13.826 --> 42:15.392
- Start with Tony.
- Tania.

42:18.831 --> 42:20.931
- All votes for Tania.
- Shit, it's your dad.

42:20.933 --> 42:23.834
Oh my God, no, no, no,
look, I am completely innocent.

42:23.836 --> 42:25.302
- You can't do this.
- Shoot her...

42:25.304 --> 42:26.537
- Okay, listen to me.
- Come on, sit down and stop shouting.

42:26.539 --> 42:30.009
- Won't she?
- Come on, who is this chick anyway?

42:32.111 --> 42:33.777
God.

42:33.779 --> 42:35.014
Tennie.

42:35.481 --> 42:37.981
Tennie, what's happening?
What's going on?

42:37.983 --> 42:40.150
You! You... you're the problem.

42:40.152 --> 42:44.221
How did you even know I was gonna be here?
I mean Jack, did you tell him?

42:44.223 --> 42:45.124
No.

42:46.525 --> 42:49.493
No, no, no, no, no. Sweetie,
last week I got an email from the PTA.

42:49.495 --> 42:51.862
- The PTA.
- That there is a play.

42:51.864 --> 42:54.998
Since when were you a
part of the PTA, dad?

42:55.000 --> 42:58.804
You can't keep doing this. I mean it's
just... it's like you don't even know me.

43:09.448 --> 43:10.883
Mr. Grigorian.

43:11.984 --> 43:14.351
Mr. Grigorian,
good evening, Sir.

43:14.353 --> 43:16.255
- I don't know if this is a good time.
- It's not.

43:16.922 --> 43:19.289
Good evening, Sir.
My name is Anna.

43:19.291 --> 43:21.760
Narbeh's girlfriend and
one of Tennie's friends.

43:22.261 --> 43:26.265
- So, what did you think of tonight's performance?
- Which one?

43:26.865 --> 43:28.165
Hold on a second.

43:28.167 --> 43:31.435
- Aren't you the wannabe director?
- He already is one.

43:31.437 --> 43:33.772
- Have you seen his reel?
- I have.

43:34.206 --> 43:35.405
It's actually pretty good.

43:35.407 --> 43:38.777
- Is it?
- Hold on a second. I think I have a spare copy.

43:39.578 --> 43:40.479
It's okay.

43:41.814 --> 43:44.350
Have you ever done
any documentaries?

43:47.186 --> 43:48.821
Not yet.

43:55.894 --> 43:58.895
Narbeh, this is what
I want you to do.

43:58.897 --> 44:03.867
I want you to make a documentary on
Tennie without her knowing about it.

44:03.869 --> 44:06.270
I couldn't do that. She's
one of my best friends.

44:06.272 --> 44:08.138
This could be your big break.

44:08.140 --> 44:09.506
Consider it a job.

44:09.508 --> 44:11.608
Sit down, it's not the time.

44:11.610 --> 44:13.545
Listen to your girlfriend.

44:14.346 --> 44:17.549
- And producer, right Narbeh?
- Let's not rush into things.

44:19.118 --> 44:23.553
You know, maybe instead of pushing him
away you could find a way to bring him in.

44:23.555 --> 44:26.125
Keep your friends close
and your enemies closer.

44:26.992 --> 44:27.993
I think I get it.

44:29.828 --> 44:34.431
You act like you and your dad are best friends
and you could get him to do whatever you want.

44:34.433 --> 44:35.966
I do it all the time.

44:35.968 --> 44:37.503
Yeah, Michelle, we know.

44:39.238 --> 44:45.044
Tennie, you don't have to answer this but
why doesn't your dad date? It's been years.

44:45.645 --> 44:48.412
That's something you
have to ask him, not me.

44:48.414 --> 44:50.482
Maybe if we found him someone-

44:51.250 --> 44:54.284
- Like a hooker?
- Seriously?

44:54.286 --> 44:56.386
- What?
- A hooker?

44:56.388 --> 44:58.055
Yeah.

44:58.057 --> 45:02.225
I want you to film everyone, I don't care,
friends, family, man, woman, no gender,

45:02.227 --> 45:06.163
anyone who knows anything
about Tennie I want to know.

45:06.165 --> 45:09.199
- Mr. Grigorian...
- Consider it done.

45:09.201 --> 45:10.934
- I like her.
- Think about it.

45:10.936 --> 45:15.439
There are so many divorced and single women
that would love to go out with your dad.

45:15.441 --> 45:20.344
And creating a dating profile for him
would be a piece of cake, right, Michelle?

45:20.346 --> 45:23.015
No, I don't think so.

45:23.482 --> 45:25.115
He's really stubborn.

45:25.117 --> 45:27.617
Plus, he's kind of shy
and awkward with woman.

45:27.619 --> 45:29.219
I don't think it's gonna work.

45:29.221 --> 45:30.987
I'm not gonna betray her trust.

45:30.989 --> 45:32.989
You're not betraying anyone.

45:32.991 --> 45:36.927
You're repairing a relationship
between a father and his daughter.

45:36.929 --> 45:38.864
They give Oscars out for this.

45:40.099 --> 45:41.634
Good. Now.

45:42.935 --> 45:46.105
Listen to your girlfriend,
I mean producer.

45:47.306 --> 45:49.074
Confidentiality agreement.

45:51.343 --> 45:53.210
Fine, I'll do it but
under one condition.

45:53.212 --> 45:54.681
Done. Cheers. Bye.

45:55.648 --> 45:59.583
Look, if you're gonna go through with
this, you need to be nice to your dad

45:59.585 --> 46:01.485
and you have to
hang out with him.

46:01.487 --> 46:05.391
That will give us the time
to make him a dating profile.

46:06.358 --> 46:08.060
A dating profile?

46:10.429 --> 46:14.500
I mean he does want to
spend some time with me.

47:13.325 --> 47:16.526
- What? She cute?
- Yeah, she's really cure.

47:16.528 --> 47:18.997
- She Armenian?
- No, she's Asian.

47:19.498 --> 47:20.665
Oh.

47:53.232 --> 47:55.398
- Hey, dad.
- Hey.

47:55.400 --> 47:56.568
You know what I was thinking?

47:57.436 --> 47:59.804
Let me guess,
a trip to Bahamas.

47:59.806 --> 48:01.639
- No.
- No? How about Germany?

48:01.641 --> 48:05.308
Spain? Sweden?
Sweden? No, not Sweden.

48:05.310 --> 48:06.811
- Safari?
- No, dad.

48:06.813 --> 48:08.679
- No?
- No.

48:08.681 --> 48:11.481
You know how we've
gotten a lot closer lately.

48:11.483 --> 48:12.417
Yes.

48:12.852 --> 48:15.118
Okay, I'm just gonna say it.

48:15.120 --> 48:16.088
Say what?

48:16.789 --> 48:18.590
I think you should start dating.

48:19.258 --> 48:23.460
Me? No, no, no. I don't
think so. Not for me.

48:23.462 --> 48:27.732
Why not? Come on, women
check you out everywhere we go.

48:27.734 --> 48:31.434
Women check you
out there. No, no.

48:31.436 --> 48:32.703
- Really?
- Yeah.

48:32.705 --> 48:34.538
- They do?
- Mm-hmm.

48:34.540 --> 48:36.674
No, I don't know.

48:41.580 --> 48:46.051
- Is there anything you know that I don't know?
- No, of course, not.

48:46.585 --> 48:49.286
Is there anything I should
know that I don't know?

48:49.288 --> 48:50.387
No.

48:50.389 --> 48:53.624
Okay. Look, it's really simple.

48:53.626 --> 48:56.560
All you do is go to these meet and
greets and within the first minute

48:56.562 --> 48:58.631
you can decide if you want to
see these women again or not.

48:59.298 --> 49:01.832
Tennie, I don't know. I'm not comfortable.
You know it's not for me.

49:01.834 --> 49:04.134
- I mean I want to...
- I already made you one.

49:04.136 --> 49:05.602
- Is that me?
- Mm-Hm.

49:05.604 --> 49:09.441
Look, all these women are dying to
meet you this Wednesday. Come on.

49:10.677 --> 49:11.610
You know what?

49:12.645 --> 49:15.579
I'm not comfortable
but I will think about it.

49:15.581 --> 49:17.715
Look, this one's
really pretty, look.

49:17.717 --> 49:21.153
I don't know. Let me
think about it, okay?

49:22.387 --> 49:23.788
Please.

49:23.790 --> 49:26.124
If you're not gonna do it for you,
can you at least do it for me?

49:38.671 --> 49:40.638
- Robert?
- Yes.

49:40.640 --> 49:44.574
I received my PhD from Harvard
specializing in gender studies

49:44.576 --> 49:49.579
with a focus on domestic violence in our
patriarchal society across the past century.

49:49.581 --> 49:53.218
So I'm too emotional.

49:53.686 --> 49:57.788
So I thought that... that I am
open to expressing my emotions.

49:57.790 --> 50:02.693
Do you like kids? I hate
kids, especially teenagers.

50:02.695 --> 50:06.964
I love my kids. But after a certain
age you have to look after yourself.

50:06.966 --> 50:10.701
They look sticky
and they smell funny.

50:10.703 --> 50:11.401
Ugh!

50:11.403 --> 50:12.737
I oppose traditional male roles

50:12.739 --> 50:16.206
and I do not partake in the
consumption of alcohol of any kind.

50:16.208 --> 50:17.607
You are in a bar.

50:17.609 --> 50:19.544
I am not annoying!

50:20.212 --> 50:21.511
Am I?

50:21.513 --> 50:23.881
Are you the kind of man
who can satisfy me?

50:23.883 --> 50:25.350
I can try.

50:26.218 --> 50:26.819
Dad.

50:27.987 --> 50:30.355
Hello. Hello.

50:30.857 --> 50:32.355
Whoa.

50:32.357 --> 50:33.991
Oh! What did you say?

50:33.993 --> 50:39.197
Okay, you know what? Uh, I'll...
I'll think about it, okay?

50:39.832 --> 50:41.331
I love you.

50:41.333 --> 50:43.703
Can I at least pick you up after work
tomorrow? We can talk about it then.

50:44.369 --> 50:45.602
Sure, sure.

50:45.604 --> 50:50.306
- So, Robert, what do you think?
- Do I like pink or sky-blue?

50:50.308 --> 50:51.776
<i>I think you would
look good in either.</i>

50:51.778 --> 50:53.543
- So I'll just get both.
- <i>Jenny.</i>

50:53.545 --> 50:55.646
<i>Jenny, Jenny,
about tonight's dinner,</i>

50:55.648 --> 51:00.019
I just wanted to let you know that
I might not be able to make it.

51:03.890 --> 51:04.857
Hello.

51:05.557 --> 51:07.559
It's okay, I understand.

51:07.994 --> 51:08.928
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

51:09.729 --> 51:11.463
<i>No need to apologize.</i>

51:12.531 --> 51:14.232
I'll talk to you later.

51:16.535 --> 51:18.303
Do you see what she does to me?

51:18.838 --> 51:20.403
I really have to end this.

51:20.405 --> 51:21.606
So why don't you?

51:23.076 --> 51:26.879
Because there is still two weeks
till the escrow closes, okay? Now go.

51:32.785 --> 51:35.753
Hey, your dad's with Blake
in the downstairs studio.

51:35.755 --> 51:37.021
They should be in just
a couple more minutes.

51:37.023 --> 51:40.423
- But I'm going to Starbucks. You want something?
- I'm good.

51:40.425 --> 51:43.560
- Thank you.
- Cappuccino, coffee, frappe?

51:43.562 --> 51:45.564
Nice flowers. Who are they from?

51:46.465 --> 51:50.433
Oh, you know, satisfied clients.

51:50.435 --> 51:52.404
So, okay, bye.

51:58.845 --> 52:01.078
"You make me feel so complete.

52:01.080 --> 52:02.414
Jenny."

52:07.552 --> 52:08.654
Hey, Laura.

52:09.756 --> 52:12.759
No, I've not seen
what you posted, yet.

52:14.493 --> 52:16.763
Of course. Always.

52:17.897 --> 52:21.667
Hey, make sure to
snap us everything.

52:24.771 --> 52:25.872
Hi.

52:26.906 --> 52:29.774
Sorry, I just came to drop
these off for Robert.

52:29.776 --> 52:30.674
It's okay.

52:30.676 --> 52:32.676
I'll talk to you later.

52:32.678 --> 52:34.714
Oh my God, you must be Tennie.

52:35.681 --> 52:37.081
Yeah.

52:37.083 --> 52:40.519
- Do I know you?
- You are even more beautiful than in your pictures.

52:41.788 --> 52:44.989
- Um... I'm sorry, you are?
- Oh, I'm Jennifer.

52:44.991 --> 52:46.356
But you can call me Jenny.

52:46.358 --> 52:48.360
It's nice to finally meet you.

52:48.928 --> 52:50.062
This Jenny?

52:52.364 --> 52:55.735
Ah, I thought I'd sent
those to the house.

52:57.103 --> 52:59.005
I'm sorry, I need a second.

53:00.072 --> 53:01.540
Honey, are you okay?

53:03.475 --> 53:04.677
Blake, this is good.

53:05.845 --> 53:07.713
Can I watch it one more time?

53:11.918 --> 53:13.920
<i>We are on
this Earth for a reason.</i>

53:14.921 --> 53:17.723
<i>We fix the hearts
that are infirm or failing,</i>

53:18.490 --> 53:21.661
<i>and nurture them to rise
in health once more.</i>

53:22.161 --> 53:28.868
<i>We've seen a thousand tales of hope prevailing,
communities made stronger than before.</i>

53:29.635 --> 53:32.537
<i>You inspire us to do more
than practice medicine.</i>

53:33.773 --> 53:36.843
<i>You inspire us
to transform lives.</i>

53:37.509 --> 53:40.478
<i>Adventist Health,
Together Inspired.</i>

53:49.021 --> 53:51.858
<i>Hello, Bamboo
Dumpling, how may I help you?</i>

53:52.658 --> 53:53.491
<i>Hello?</i>

53:54.861 --> 53:58.898
<i>Somebody there? The one
that tried call back?</i>

54:02.802 --> 54:05.370
Why did you just call
a Chinese restaurant?

54:06.538 --> 54:08.538
Oh, I thought I was
calling the hospital.

54:08.540 --> 54:10.440
Oh my God, there is no number.

54:10.442 --> 54:11.409
Huh.

54:11.944 --> 54:13.043
But you did good.

54:13.045 --> 54:14.412
Just the number.

54:15.480 --> 54:16.546
- Blake.
- Yeah.

54:16.548 --> 54:17.982
It starts with eight-one-eight.

54:17.984 --> 54:19.018
Thanks, boss.

54:19.952 --> 54:22.753
All I am asking
is an email, Daniella.

54:22.755 --> 54:23.756
Thank you.

54:27.727 --> 54:28.961
Talk about fate.

54:29.561 --> 54:30.761
- Hi.
- Hi.

54:30.763 --> 54:32.796
She just came by
to drop off your gifts.

54:32.798 --> 54:34.464
And here she was.

54:34.466 --> 54:38.137
Who would have thought?
Not even in my wildest dreams.

54:39.772 --> 54:41.805
I see you two have met.

54:41.807 --> 54:44.808
Yep. She's very nice, dad.

54:44.810 --> 54:47.545
A bit annoying, but nice.

54:47.914 --> 54:51.715
- Tennie...
- It's okay, Robert, I have been droning on since I got here.

54:51.717 --> 54:53.817
Please, let her
express herself.

54:53.819 --> 54:57.056
Yeah, Robert, she talks a lot.

54:57.657 --> 54:59.290
Now it's my turn.

54:59.292 --> 55:02.960
- Can we do this at home?
- Why would we do this at home? We're all here, aren't we?

55:02.962 --> 55:06.730
Unless you want to invite her home,
or maybe she's been there already.

55:06.732 --> 55:08.134
Tennie, stop.

55:08.801 --> 55:10.734
You have every right
to ask questions.

55:10.736 --> 55:12.570
Go ahead, ask me.

55:13.139 --> 55:16.506
Tell me three things
you love about my dad.

55:16.508 --> 55:18.510
She's been nothing but nice.

55:19.544 --> 55:20.913
It's okay, Robert.

55:21.714 --> 55:23.681
Your father has a big heart.

55:23.683 --> 55:25.783
Yeah, his cardiologist
thinks so, too.

55:25.785 --> 55:27.151
- Tennie.
- What?

55:27.153 --> 55:28.686
He's loyal.

55:28.688 --> 55:30.122
Loyal to whom exactly?

55:30.890 --> 55:31.857
His employees?

55:32.725 --> 55:35.227
His clients? You? Or me?

55:36.528 --> 55:37.828
Okay, time to go.

55:37.830 --> 55:40.232
And I love your father's
honest nature.

55:41.167 --> 55:45.102
Are you freaking kidding me?
What planet are you from?

55:45.104 --> 55:48.074
- You're not very bright, are you?
- Hey, Tennie.

55:51.043 --> 55:52.544
I'm so sorry, Robert.

55:52.912 --> 55:56.215
Obviously, I'm not good
enough for your father.

55:57.183 --> 55:59.717
Thank you for making
things clear.

55:59.719 --> 56:01.852
- You're welcome.
- Jenny. Jenny.

56:01.854 --> 56:05.189
Je... I'm very
disappointed in you.

56:05.191 --> 56:05.992
I don't care.

56:22.074 --> 56:23.075
What?

56:24.176 --> 56:26.012
I wish you would have asked
me what really matters.

56:27.646 --> 56:30.016
And that's how your
father feels about you.

56:31.283 --> 56:33.585
You are his entire world.

56:34.220 --> 56:38.124
You are part of every decision
that he makes in his life.

56:38.958 --> 56:43.561
And he loves you more
than you will ever know.

56:43.996 --> 56:48.067
Om...

56:54.273 --> 56:56.106
- Robert.
- No more Jenny.

56:56.108 --> 56:58.242
No more Jenny.
No more Jenny.

56:58.244 --> 57:01.245
Are you serious?
You mean it's over?

57:01.247 --> 57:05.315
- Wait, Robert, what about the house situation?
- That's why I have you.

57:05.317 --> 57:07.751
You... I gotta go. We'll talk.

57:07.753 --> 57:08.954
Robert. Argh!

57:09.789 --> 57:10.921
Hey, dad.

57:10.923 --> 57:11.855
Hey.

57:11.857 --> 57:13.259
I have something to tell you.

57:13.893 --> 57:15.127
It's about Jenny.

57:15.895 --> 57:18.162
I wanted to apologize
for the way I acted.

57:18.164 --> 57:19.930
Good, you should.

57:19.932 --> 57:21.834
I think she's good for you.

57:22.201 --> 57:24.003
You should keep seeing her.

57:25.838 --> 57:29.306
After what happened today?
You're too young to understand.

57:29.308 --> 57:32.276
What do you mean I'm too young
to understand? I'm not a child.

57:32.278 --> 57:34.645
What you did today
was childish, okay?

57:34.647 --> 57:36.280
And you're a hypocrite.
You know that?

57:36.282 --> 57:37.781
Excuse me?

57:37.783 --> 57:41.685
First you teach your child to grow
up without dating outside the race

57:41.687 --> 57:44.054
and then you go do
the exact opposite.

57:44.056 --> 57:47.224
Are you serious? You have no
idea what you're talking about.

57:47.226 --> 57:49.161
Dad, you lied to me!

57:51.030 --> 57:54.934
And yeah, maybe that's
why I acted the way I did.

57:55.434 --> 57:56.802
And I admit it.

57:57.369 --> 57:58.304
I was wrong.

57:59.038 --> 57:59.972
Good.

58:00.439 --> 58:01.307
Good?

58:02.508 --> 58:05.175
I came here to apologize and
you just made me feel worse.

58:05.177 --> 58:07.279
You know you always do this.

58:11.250 --> 58:12.351
Do you love me?

58:14.053 --> 58:17.223
I mean do you really love me?

58:18.124 --> 58:20.023
Of course, I love you.

58:20.025 --> 58:23.360
You say that but how
come I don't feel it?

58:23.362 --> 58:25.162
What do you mean
you don't feel it?

58:25.164 --> 58:28.098
I mean, either you
love me or you don't.

58:28.100 --> 58:31.368
Do I love you?
Yes, of course, I do.

58:31.370 --> 58:32.838
And what about that?

58:34.406 --> 58:37.174
This is just barely a hobby.

58:37.176 --> 58:39.211
No, I remember
when that started.

58:40.179 --> 58:42.212
Mom didn't make you happy.

58:42.214 --> 58:45.449
- Please, Tennie, okay?
- No, dad.

58:45.451 --> 58:47.186
You want to get
to know me, right?

58:48.020 --> 58:50.856
You gotta know that
I remember everything.

58:51.790 --> 58:55.761
I remember the arguments you
and mom had when I was 12,

58:56.395 --> 59:00.666
the sad unhappy environment
I was growing up in.

59:02.334 --> 59:04.403
Dad, you almost left us!

59:06.772 --> 59:08.805
And then it all changed.

59:08.807 --> 59:16.382
Mom got sick, so you decided to stay
and you held her hand till the very end.

59:17.016 --> 59:23.322
And I play that moment in
my head over and over again.

59:23.989 --> 59:27.993
But if I could go back
and mom was still alive,

59:30.062 --> 59:32.164
and I think you were
happy without her,

59:33.365 --> 59:36.001
I'd prefer you guys to
go your separate ways.

59:37.503 --> 59:39.438
And now you're stuck with me.

59:54.887 --> 59:58.488
Tennie, I'm just saying I do
not like this idea at all, okay?

59:58.490 --> 1:00:01.525
Dad, Jenny deserves
to know how you feel.

1:00:01.527 --> 1:00:04.330
Yeah, yeah,
yeah, yeah. It's just

1:00:05.397 --> 1:00:09.132
going to dinner... come on,
can I just call her? Maybe it's too much.

1:00:09.134 --> 1:00:12.805
- I can text her.
- No, this has to be in person.

1:00:13.272 --> 1:00:16.974
Come on, hold her, show her
how much you care for her.

1:00:16.976 --> 1:00:17.943
Anything else?

1:00:19.044 --> 1:00:20.212
Oh, boy.

1:00:21.280 --> 1:00:22.748
I need a drink.

1:00:25.851 --> 1:00:30.187
No, no, honey,
it was my fault.

1:00:30.189 --> 1:00:32.389
She was a wonderful kid.

1:00:32.391 --> 1:00:33.359
You're lucky.

1:00:34.293 --> 1:00:35.427
We are lucky.

1:00:36.495 --> 1:00:38.530
I knew you would
come back to me.

1:00:39.531 --> 1:00:42.935
Like I said before, it's fate.

1:00:44.003 --> 1:00:48.907
Although you haven't
said a word tonight.

1:00:49.308 --> 1:00:53.879
Just you being here,
I can see it in your eyes.

1:00:54.380 --> 1:00:56.782
I can feel it in your touch.

1:00:57.316 --> 1:01:00.853
I couldn't imagine being
anywhere else right now.

1:01:02.187 --> 1:01:03.922
Good evening, Mrs. Stevenson.

1:01:10.162 --> 1:01:11.263
Excuse me?

1:01:14.533 --> 1:01:16.035
Who are these people?

1:01:17.603 --> 1:01:20.039
They are my
husband's associates.

1:01:20.539 --> 1:01:22.841
- What?
- It is his birthday.

1:01:23.409 --> 1:01:24.243
It's time to go.

1:01:25.244 --> 1:01:27.978
He won't cut the cake
unless you were there.

1:01:27.980 --> 1:01:28.580
He won't cut...

1:01:33.385 --> 1:01:34.420
Sorry.

1:01:37.022 --> 1:01:39.990
I thought you said
you were divorced.

1:01:39.992 --> 1:01:41.460
Separated.

1:01:42.194 --> 1:01:44.662
Separated. What?

1:01:44.664 --> 1:01:47.364
You still love me, right?

1:01:47.366 --> 1:01:50.269
Love has nothing
to do with this.

1:01:52.137 --> 1:01:53.405
Excuse me.

1:01:54.173 --> 1:01:56.241
Compliments of your daughter.

1:01:57.509 --> 1:01:59.211
My... Tennie?

1:02:08.187 --> 1:02:11.490
You didn't even care for her to begin with?
All this just for a house?

1:02:12.391 --> 1:02:13.624
Prime real estate.

1:02:13.626 --> 1:02:15.525
Okay, but you could have at
least, you know, told me that

1:02:15.527 --> 1:02:18.297
so I didn't spend my entire
savings to hire a violinist.

1:02:19.198 --> 1:02:20.364
Well, she was good.

1:02:20.366 --> 1:02:22.299
Well, what about
the other night?

1:02:22.301 --> 1:02:26.338
Right here I poured my heart out to
you, I cried apologizing for Jenny.

1:02:26.939 --> 1:02:27.940
Sorry.

1:02:28.307 --> 1:02:29.940
But it was very sincere.

1:02:29.942 --> 1:02:32.476
Dad, you can't go
behind my back like that.

1:02:32.478 --> 1:02:34.279
You have to be honest.

1:02:35.481 --> 1:02:37.381
- Please?
- Hmm.

1:02:37.383 --> 1:02:38.384
Thank you.

1:02:39.485 --> 1:02:43.021
Do you have anything else
to say? Anything at all?

1:02:43.989 --> 1:02:44.590
Nope.

1:02:45.557 --> 1:02:46.458
Okay.

1:02:52.164 --> 1:02:53.666
I think Blake is gay.

1:02:54.500 --> 1:02:58.535
- What?
- I don't know, I'm just saying, maybe.

1:02:58.537 --> 1:03:02.941
In case if it's true,
okay? Just saying.

1:03:04.610 --> 1:03:06.644
- We're cool?
- Sure.

1:03:06.646 --> 1:03:07.680
Good.

1:03:10.549 --> 1:03:14.084
You want to come to Sacramento tomorrow?
It's only for one night.

1:03:14.086 --> 1:03:15.352
No, Dad, I'm good.

1:03:15.354 --> 1:03:17.154
Plus, Laura's coming
back tomorrow.

1:03:17.156 --> 1:03:19.022
Okay, all right.

1:03:19.024 --> 1:03:20.691
- You'll be safe?
- Promise.

1:03:20.693 --> 1:03:22.760
All right. Give me a kiss.

1:03:22.762 --> 1:03:24.261
Goodnight, Dad.

1:03:24.263 --> 1:03:25.362
Goodnight.

1:03:53.325 --> 1:03:55.358
<i>Hi, Mr. Grigorian.
This is Narbeh.</i>

1:03:55.360 --> 1:03:58.096
<i>I finished the editing of Tennie's
documentary as I promised.</i>

1:03:58.731 --> 1:04:01.498
<i>Everyone from school,
her relatives interviewed.</i>

1:04:01.500 --> 1:04:04.735
<i>The only people, and I didn't approach,
of course, are Michelle and Laura</i>

1:04:04.737 --> 1:04:07.370
<i>knowing they wouldn't
want to be a part of it.</i>

1:04:07.372 --> 1:04:11.176
<i>With everything with shots, I think
you'll really get to know who she is.</i>

1:04:27.794 --> 1:04:29.159
Yes, Ma'am.

1:04:29.161 --> 1:04:32.496
Jack, I would never ask you this
unless I really trusted you.

1:04:32.498 --> 1:04:33.698
Yeah, you know you can.

1:04:33.700 --> 1:04:37.269
- What's up?
- I need a huge favor for tomorrow night.

1:04:47.814 --> 1:04:50.650
- Oh, this party is gonna be so cool.
- I know.

1:05:17.276 --> 1:05:19.478
Okay, I get it, Robert.
Just tell me what happened.

1:05:20.345 --> 1:05:23.048
What do you mean you're
back? You're at the airport?

1:05:23.683 --> 1:05:25.148
Okay, well, just take a cab,

1:05:25.150 --> 1:05:27.551
an Uber or something and I'll just
figure out where the hell he is.

1:05:27.553 --> 1:05:30.188
- All right.
- One, two, three, four!

1:05:33.525 --> 1:05:35.425
You did something to your hair?

1:05:35.427 --> 1:05:39.764
- Yeah, do you like it?
- Yeah, I love you guys so much.

1:05:39.766 --> 1:05:44.467
Honestly, don't trust
anybody the way I trust you.

1:05:44.469 --> 1:05:45.703
- Hey, girls.
- Hey!

1:05:45.705 --> 1:05:49.441
- How you guys doing? Can I get you guys anything?
- Jack.

1:05:50.409 --> 1:05:52.578
Okay guys, watch this.

1:05:53.880 --> 1:05:55.547
- Here, got your drink.
- Thank you.

1:05:56.548 --> 1:06:00.718
Narbeh, get your
cute butt over here.

1:06:00.720 --> 1:06:02.619
I need you to film this.

1:06:02.621 --> 1:06:05.792
- What the hell?
- Everybody quiet down!

1:06:06.626 --> 1:06:09.492
Have your camera ready. Come on, let's go.
This is gonna be epic.

1:06:09.494 --> 1:06:11.330
I have something to say.

1:06:12.331 --> 1:06:15.700
- You're getting this, right?
- Yeah, go ahead.

1:06:15.702 --> 1:06:19.436
I'd like to thank everybody
for coming out tonight,

1:06:19.438 --> 1:06:23.674
especially you, and my best
friends Michelle and Laura.

1:06:23.676 --> 1:06:24.842
I love you guys.

1:06:24.844 --> 1:06:26.879
And the one and only Narbeh

1:06:27.647 --> 1:06:29.346
behind the camera.

1:06:29.348 --> 1:06:32.415
He has been my best
friend since childhood.

1:06:32.417 --> 1:06:35.418
Who would have thought he'd be
the one to stab me in the back.

1:06:35.420 --> 1:06:38.355
- What is she talking about?
- I have no idea.

1:06:38.357 --> 1:06:41.226
Don't you dare turn that off.
You keep that shit on.

1:06:42.327 --> 1:06:43.828
Don't touch me, asshole.

1:06:43.830 --> 1:06:45.663
You're a part of this, too, huh?

1:06:45.665 --> 1:06:46.897
Okay, Tennie,
look, you're drunk.

1:06:46.899 --> 1:06:49.667
So what? Who else
here was in it, huh?

1:06:49.669 --> 1:06:53.236
Which one of you assholes
got in front of the camera?

1:06:53.238 --> 1:06:58.610
You have something to say? Just say it to
my face or get the hell out of my house!

1:07:00.379 --> 1:07:09.586
Narbeh, why? Out of all the people in my
life you are the only guy I ever trusted.

1:07:09.588 --> 1:07:12.322
Okay, look, you got to stop
acting like this. Let's go.

1:07:12.324 --> 1:07:14.959
Or what? You are gonna
report me to my dad?

1:07:14.961 --> 1:07:17.697
He doesn't have to,
he's already here.

1:07:18.998 --> 1:07:20.931
Welcome home.

1:07:20.933 --> 1:07:22.667
Sorry about the mess.

1:07:22.669 --> 1:07:26.269
- Have you been drinking?
- So what if I have?

1:07:26.271 --> 1:07:27.370
I'm sorry, Robert.

1:07:27.372 --> 1:07:31.410
Sorry about what? For
getting us all those drinks?

1:07:31.844 --> 1:07:37.516
How does it feel, Dad? This
is what betrayal feels like.

1:07:38.918 --> 1:07:43.420
You looked me straight in the
eyes and you lied to me, again!

1:07:43.422 --> 1:07:44.857
I hate you!

1:07:45.557 --> 1:07:47.960
- Tennie...
- I never want to see you again.

1:08:11.951 --> 1:08:13.518
Hold on a second, Robert.

1:08:15.888 --> 1:08:18.290
She'll be fine. She's resting.

1:08:19.624 --> 1:08:22.260
Robert, you've seen me go
through this before, remember?

1:08:23.595 --> 1:08:28.333
What's interesting is that she called me
earlier today asking about spending the night.

1:08:29.635 --> 1:08:31.669
<i>I know you're disappointed.</i>

1:08:31.671 --> 1:08:35.908
<i>Trust me, although she's 17,
she's more mature than you think.</i>

1:08:36.843 --> 1:08:41.647
<i>You know let her stay here for a few
days until you figure things out.</i>

1:08:54.060 --> 1:08:57.494
Tennie, call me, text me
if you need anything, okay?

1:09:13.679 --> 1:09:16.481
Okay, contact the
client. Anything else, more ice?

1:09:17.449 --> 1:09:19.952
- Robert, you okay?
- Yeah.

1:09:20.519 --> 1:09:23.055
- You would tell me, right?
- Thank you.

1:09:28.094 --> 1:09:29.662
You fired my cousin?

1:09:31.998 --> 1:09:35.802
He brought alcohol into my house
and gave it to my daughter.

1:09:37.804 --> 1:09:40.039
Look, Jack is devastated.

1:09:40.940 --> 1:09:43.876
Honestly, I thought it was
good for him to be around you.

1:09:44.644 --> 1:09:46.609
I thought you could mentor
him like you did me.

1:09:46.611 --> 1:09:49.314
It looks like it was
a bad idea to begin with.

1:09:50.783 --> 1:09:55.320
To have my cousin driving you around or
trying to be another one of Tennie's friends?

1:10:13.806 --> 1:10:17.574
Tennie. Tennie, I
already said I was sorry.

1:10:17.576 --> 1:10:19.946
Tennie, can you talk
to me please? Tennie.

1:10:20.680 --> 1:10:21.712
It's okay.

1:10:21.714 --> 1:10:23.013
She'll forgive you eventually.

1:10:23.015 --> 1:10:24.549
You just have to give her time.

1:10:25.051 --> 1:10:29.554
<i>♪ I'm better than you
You, you, you ♪</i>

1:10:32.158 --> 1:10:35.127
<i>♪ Let it lose
It's time to set the groove ♪</i>

1:10:37.462 --> 1:10:40.432
<i>♪ Listen up, let me show you
What I got you up ♪</i>

1:10:42.635 --> 1:10:45.972
<i>♪ So congregate
You said you better be great ♪</i>

1:10:48.708 --> 1:10:51.610
<i>♪ You have no clue what
It takes not be replaced ♪</i>

1:10:53.112 --> 1:10:56.579
<i>♪ If I have to warn you
Jump or lose it ♪</i>

1:10:56.581 --> 1:10:59.884
<i>♪ One day remains unchanged
I'm better than you ♪</i>

1:11:01.220 --> 1:11:02.855
<i>♪ You, you, you ♪</i>

1:11:09.695 --> 1:11:12.129
You know that English
test was pretty hard today.

1:11:12.131 --> 1:11:13.733
Yeah, I hate that teacher.

1:11:15.101 --> 1:11:16.601
Narbeh doesn't deserve this.

1:11:17.103 --> 1:11:19.136
What do you want, Anna?

1:11:19.138 --> 1:11:21.573
Look, I came to apologize

1:11:22.975 --> 1:11:24.542
and to give you this.

1:11:25.477 --> 1:11:27.543
Narbeh was against it
from the beginning.

1:11:27.545 --> 1:11:30.180
He didn't want to screw over
one of his best friends.

1:11:30.182 --> 1:11:32.617
I was the one that
pushed him into it.

1:11:33.119 --> 1:11:35.753
If you want someone
to blame, blame me.

1:11:35.755 --> 1:11:37.587
And you expect me
to believe that?

1:11:37.589 --> 1:11:39.692
Believe what you want
but it's the truth.

1:11:40.893 --> 1:11:42.862
I just figured you
deserve to see it.

1:11:46.699 --> 1:11:49.266
Maybe then we'll see which
Tennie you end up choosing to be.

1:11:49.268 --> 1:11:51.501
What is that supposed to mean?

1:11:51.503 --> 1:11:52.738
It's all in there.

1:11:54.941 --> 1:11:56.774
How could you
believe that bitch?

1:11:56.776 --> 1:11:58.809
Tennie, I think
you should watch it.

1:11:58.811 --> 1:12:00.878
- Why?
- Because I did.

1:12:00.880 --> 1:12:02.648
Narbeh showed it to me.

1:12:15.995 --> 1:12:17.460
Hey, Tennie.

1:12:17.462 --> 1:12:21.231
So before I start filming, I'm recording
this I guess just to let you know

1:12:21.233 --> 1:12:22.900
that I never intended
to harm you.

1:12:22.902 --> 1:12:26.737
It's just that I finally have the opportunity
to get a final cut on my own project.

1:12:26.739 --> 1:12:31.208
I mean not even Scorsese got a chance
to have final cut on his first movie.

1:12:31.210 --> 1:12:32.910
So there's that to think about.

1:12:32.912 --> 1:12:34.680
In any case, peace out.

1:12:39.685 --> 1:12:41.385
Yeah, Tennie is pretty cool.

1:12:41.387 --> 1:12:47.026
She can be a bit cold sometimes, but I know
if I ever need any help, she'll be there.

1:12:47.626 --> 1:12:51.161
Tennie, I love her. She's family,
you know, but she's a bit spoiled.

1:12:51.163 --> 1:12:52.930
She knows it. She likes it.

1:12:52.932 --> 1:12:55.933
<i>Tennie, she has
good and bad days.</i>

1:12:55.935 --> 1:12:58.004
<i>She doesn't talk
to people like me.</i>

1:13:00.806 --> 1:13:04.742
It's that time of the year again, folks,
the Mother's Day jewelry campaign.

1:13:04.744 --> 1:13:06.877
- What do we have?
- All right, I got it, I got it.

1:13:06.879 --> 1:13:08.879
What if we go all the way back?

1:13:08.881 --> 1:13:11.949
I mean you don't remember your
first words or being born, right?

1:13:11.951 --> 1:13:15.585
No, but your mom does.

1:13:15.587 --> 1:13:17.354
- Exactly.
- Go on.

1:13:17.356 --> 1:13:23.660
Imagine all of these memorable events from a
child being born all the way to when she's grown

1:13:23.662 --> 1:13:29.233
and presents her mother the diamond and
then a text reads throughout the ad.

1:13:29.235 --> 1:13:31.935
"I don't remember
seeing mom for the first time.

1:13:31.937 --> 1:13:33.973
I don't remember my first step.

1:13:34.774 --> 1:13:38.742
But when I look at you,
I see it all in your eyes."

1:13:38.744 --> 1:13:40.244
Happy Mother's Day.

1:13:40.246 --> 1:13:41.378
I love it.

1:13:41.380 --> 1:13:43.747
- Hallelujah!
- There you go. You're welcome.

1:13:43.749 --> 1:13:47.653
- Robert, where are you going?
- You got this, Daniella. You got this.

1:13:49.321 --> 1:13:50.990
All right, guys,
let's get to it.

1:13:52.324 --> 1:13:55.261
To what do I owe the
pleasure, Mr. Grigorian?

1:13:55.861 --> 1:14:00.032
Sorry, okay? But...
but let's cut the BS.

1:14:01.333 --> 1:14:05.169
- What's said here stays here, right?
- Correct.

1:14:05.171 --> 1:14:08.072
You are not gonna
judge me or anything.

1:14:08.074 --> 1:14:09.075
Also correct.

1:14:10.342 --> 1:14:14.344
- And you're here to help, right?
- Only if you truly want my help.

1:14:14.346 --> 1:14:15.281
I do.

1:14:16.649 --> 1:14:18.082
- I do.
- Okay.

1:14:18.084 --> 1:14:22.019
What makes you think you can walk in
here, take my patient's time away

1:14:22.021 --> 1:14:25.155
and expect me to believe that
you're truly ready for my help?

1:14:25.157 --> 1:14:28.194
Because she's all I got, okay?

1:14:30.429 --> 1:14:31.997
It's not going to be easy.

1:14:33.332 --> 1:14:34.200
I know.

1:14:35.968 --> 1:14:39.872
Are you ready to revisit your
past when you suffered true loss?

1:14:40.673 --> 1:14:42.106
Yes.

1:14:42.108 --> 1:14:45.876
- Will you confront the truth and open yourself up to the pain?
- Yes.

1:14:45.878 --> 1:14:49.315
Stop lying to yourself and stop
hiding behind your drinking?

1:14:56.021 --> 1:14:57.087
Yes.

1:14:57.089 --> 1:14:58.956
You're going to feel vulnerable.

1:14:58.958 --> 1:15:00.893
Do you have the courage
to be vulnerable?

1:15:03.129 --> 1:15:05.731
Whatever it takes. Like I said,

1:15:06.866 --> 1:15:08.100
she's all I got.

1:15:14.840 --> 1:15:15.808
Good.

1:15:16.342 --> 1:15:19.078
Now, tell her that.

1:15:19.845 --> 1:15:23.015
Tell her exactly how you feel.

1:15:26.252 --> 1:15:30.921
Who the hell do they think they are? Ah,
you know the entire school thinks I'm cool.

1:15:30.923 --> 1:15:33.991
I may have a bit of an attitude
but at least they appreciate me.

1:15:33.993 --> 1:15:37.961
But my family, my own family thinks I'm
faking, pretending to be someone I'm not.

1:15:37.963 --> 1:15:39.496
I mean, come on.

1:15:39.498 --> 1:15:42.399
- Well, aren't you?
- What? No, I'm not-

1:15:42.401 --> 1:15:44.136
Why would
you even say that?

1:15:45.237 --> 1:15:46.939
You saw it yourself.

1:15:47.473 --> 1:15:50.107
Plus, it was meant for your dad.

1:15:50.109 --> 1:15:51.310
Why would they lie?

1:15:53.345 --> 1:15:55.314
Stop pretending, Tennie.

1:15:56.949 --> 1:16:02.321
I have also been pretending to be
someone I'm not for a while now.

1:16:06.025 --> 1:16:10.162
I've been having
identity crisis and

1:16:13.432 --> 1:16:18.837
I haven't told you or
anybody else because

1:16:19.471 --> 1:16:21.805
I don't know how
you'd react and

1:16:21.807 --> 1:16:23.442
I don't have many
friends, you know?

1:16:24.076 --> 1:16:25.978
Laura, it's me.

1:16:26.378 --> 1:16:28.347
You know you can tell
me anything, right?

1:16:32.918 --> 1:16:34.019
The...

1:16:35.854 --> 1:16:39.758
the person at Berkeley
that I've been talking to

1:16:43.295 --> 1:16:44.463
is a girl.

1:16:52.037 --> 1:16:54.304
She's amazing.

1:16:54.306 --> 1:16:58.177
My experience that weekend
confirmed who I really am.

1:17:00.579 --> 1:17:03.146
You're the only one
who knows this now.

1:17:03.148 --> 1:17:04.149
Hey.

1:17:04.950 --> 1:17:07.786
It's okay. It's okay. Come here.

1:17:08.954 --> 1:17:10.022
Come here.

1:17:12.091 --> 1:17:16.126
Look, why did you feel the
need to keep this from us?

1:17:16.128 --> 1:17:23.333
I didn't want to take the chance
to lose you guys, so I had to lie.

1:17:23.335 --> 1:17:24.536
You're not gonna lose us.

1:17:25.204 --> 1:17:26.272
It's okay.

1:17:28.474 --> 1:17:36.113
Hey, once you're ready to tell everyone,
you know I'll be right here for you, right,

1:17:36.115 --> 1:17:38.148
right behind you
the entire time.

1:17:38.150 --> 1:17:39.385
Thank you.

1:17:39.985 --> 1:17:41.120
Of course. Come here.

1:17:47.192 --> 1:17:48.260
It's Michelle.

1:17:49.495 --> 1:17:52.496
"Don't kill me, I'm driving
your dad's lawyers right now."

1:17:52.498 --> 1:17:54.598
- What?
- I have no clue.

1:17:54.600 --> 1:17:56.302
And there's a video attached.

1:17:58.871 --> 1:18:00.437
<i>I don't know why
you're so upset.</i>

1:18:00.439 --> 1:18:02.239
<i>Because you can't seem
to get it through your head.</i>

1:18:02.241 --> 1:18:04.508
<i>Tennie was the one
who approached me first.</i>

1:18:04.510 --> 1:18:08.078
- <i>Wow!</i>
- <i>It was her idea to keep all of this a secret.</i>

1:18:08.080 --> 1:18:11.048
<i>Oh my God, you should
write a book about it.</i>

1:18:11.050 --> 1:18:14.051
<i>You can deny it all you
want but it happened.</i>

1:18:14.053 --> 1:18:17.187
<i>Listen, kid, you can
say anything you want.</i>

1:18:17.189 --> 1:18:19.089
<i>I stand by my daughter.</i>

1:18:19.091 --> 1:18:24.227
<i>Regardless of how many stories you can come up
with, the last words that matters are hers.</i>

1:18:24.229 --> 1:18:25.531
<i>I believe her.</i>

1:18:26.131 --> 1:18:28.398
<i>Now get that through your head.</i>

1:18:28.400 --> 1:18:30.233
<i>Michelle, let's go.</i>

1:18:31.603 --> 1:18:34.338
That's what I'm talking about.

1:18:34.340 --> 1:18:36.940
That was pretty cool,
I have to admit.

1:18:36.942 --> 1:18:38.577
Yeah, kind of was, wasn't it?

1:18:39.978 --> 1:18:41.013
That's my dad.

1:18:41.580 --> 1:18:43.246
I don't
think that works.

1:18:46.919 --> 1:18:48.585
- We're here.
- Hi.

1:18:48.587 --> 1:18:51.656
- Hi. Is...
- She's up by the pool, Mr. Grigorian.

1:18:51.658 --> 1:18:52.989
Thank you, Laurie.

1:18:52.991 --> 1:18:54.159
It's Laura, Sir.

1:18:55.027 --> 1:18:56.026
Laura, yes.

1:18:56.028 --> 1:18:59.465
- Where do you think you are going?
- What?

1:19:05.003 --> 1:19:05.571
Tennie.

1:19:07.473 --> 1:19:11.009
Before you say anything,
just listen, okay?

1:19:15.080 --> 1:19:20.484
I'm not perfect and I know I
haven't been the best father to you.

1:19:20.486 --> 1:19:21.987
I admit that.

1:19:23.622 --> 1:19:26.892
You had told me the other day
not to lie to you anymore,

1:19:29.161 --> 1:19:34.266
but the problem was I have been
lying to myself this whole time.

1:19:35.601 --> 1:19:37.302
Sweetheart, the truth is

1:19:39.405 --> 1:19:44.576
when mom passed away
I lost a huge part of myself.

1:19:48.480 --> 1:19:50.082
She was my everything.

1:19:50.616 --> 1:19:51.849
My biggest supporter.

1:19:51.851 --> 1:19:56.088
Everything I achieved in this
country was because of her.

1:19:57.757 --> 1:19:59.291
And when she got sick,

1:20:02.060 --> 1:20:04.596
I stopped, I stopped everything.

1:20:05.765 --> 1:20:12.438
I used every ounce of what I
had to save her, but I couldn't.

1:20:13.572 --> 1:20:15.107
And when she died,

1:20:16.341 --> 1:20:18.377
drinking became my escape.

1:20:19.478 --> 1:20:24.717
And I work and work to provide you
with everything you could ever want.

1:20:27.186 --> 1:20:29.288
Tennie, I'm sorry. I was wrong.

1:20:29.689 --> 1:20:31.089
I was selfish.

1:20:32.491 --> 1:20:34.493
All I've done is push you away.

1:20:35.628 --> 1:20:40.299
Sweetie, if you wanna drive your
mom's old car, I understand.

1:20:40.800 --> 1:20:45.435
If you wanna stay in the same house
with all the memories, you got it.

1:20:45.437 --> 1:20:50.609
If you want to go to Berkeley
instead of UCLA, I support you.

1:20:51.376 --> 1:20:52.277
And I promise you,

1:20:53.545 --> 1:20:56.381
I promise you I will
get the help I need.

1:20:57.483 --> 1:20:59.652
I want to be the father
that you deserve,

1:21:00.787 --> 1:21:03.021
someone you
could be proud of.

1:21:06.091 --> 1:21:10.730
I've already lost your mother,
and God knows I'm not gonna lose you, too.

1:21:15.702 --> 1:21:20.005
I have something to
tell you but I'm scared.

1:21:24.142 --> 1:21:25.110
No, sweetie.

1:21:26.345 --> 1:21:28.180
Don't ever be scared, okay?

1:21:29.716 --> 1:21:31.183
You can tell me anything.

1:21:32.752 --> 1:21:35.287
You know that argument
you had with Jason?

1:21:37.155 --> 1:21:38.090
It's true.

1:21:42.327 --> 1:21:43.796
I slept with him.

1:21:45.230 --> 1:21:47.566
I never planned to do it.

1:21:49.636 --> 1:21:51.103
Being with him,

1:21:53.840 --> 1:21:55.507
for the first time...

1:22:01.580 --> 1:22:03.348
I felt special.

1:22:03.783 --> 1:22:04.583
God.

1:22:05.584 --> 1:22:08.620
You know being loved
and cared for like that,

1:22:11.423 --> 1:22:17.195
I wanted to do everything
to not lose that relationship.

1:22:21.801 --> 1:22:23.168
So that night

1:22:24.303 --> 1:22:28.173
in the heat of the
moment I gave in.

1:22:32.177 --> 1:22:34.179
And... and

1:22:35.380 --> 1:22:36.783
I know that it meant

1:22:38.417 --> 1:22:40.118
nothing to him

1:22:41.821 --> 1:22:44.857
and it meant everything to me.

1:22:49.328 --> 1:22:50.329
God.

1:22:52.665 --> 1:22:57.269
I'm so hurt and
I feel empty and-

1:22:59.504 --> 1:23:01.506
and I felt so ashamed.

1:23:03.943 --> 1:23:06.178
Don't be ashamed. Don't be.

1:23:06.779 --> 1:23:08.246
Don't say that.

1:23:13.285 --> 1:23:15.788
Dad, you
got this, come on.

1:23:16.555 --> 1:23:17.857
Phew! Let's do it.

1:23:20.525 --> 1:23:21.892
It hurts.

1:23:21.894 --> 1:23:22.695
I got it.

1:23:24.429 --> 1:23:26.797
- This one, too?
- Yeah, all of them.

1:23:29.534 --> 1:23:30.600
Food is here.

1:23:30.602 --> 1:23:31.936
Sorry it took so long.

1:23:31.938 --> 1:23:36.274
Yeah, of course, Laura had to get
her cranberry quinoa bullshit.

1:23:37.376 --> 1:23:39.378
Oh, I'm so sorry, Uncle Robert.

1:23:39.979 --> 1:23:44.982
- What is that?
- This? Oh, it's iced tea and it's none of that flavored crap.

1:23:44.984 --> 1:23:46.717
Oh, I'm so sorry again.

1:23:46.719 --> 1:23:49.354
This is what you
should be drinking.

1:23:49.722 --> 1:23:50.955
Do you want to try some?

1:23:50.957 --> 1:23:52.357
Yeah, sure.

1:23:53.325 --> 1:23:55.728
- Why are they texting me?
- What's up?

1:23:56.796 --> 1:24:01.732
Michelle, why are half the guys in
school texting me to ask if you've-

1:24:01.734 --> 1:24:02.365
Thank you.

1:24:02.367 --> 1:24:03.836
...decided about prom yet?

1:24:04.971 --> 1:24:05.738
What?

1:24:07.940 --> 1:24:08.973
Sorry.

1:24:08.975 --> 1:24:10.877
It's very good, healthy.

1:24:11.576 --> 1:24:13.476
- From Europe?
- Try it again.

1:24:13.478 --> 1:24:15.514
Again? Today?

1:24:16.615 --> 1:24:17.815
Okay.

1:24:17.817 --> 1:24:19.884
I haven't decided yet.

1:24:19.886 --> 1:24:21.420
It's in two days.

1:24:22.722 --> 1:24:25.488
Aren't I gonna meet your mystery
date in a couple of days?

1:24:25.490 --> 1:24:26.791
Yeah.

1:24:26.793 --> 1:24:27.758
All right, then.

1:24:27.760 --> 1:24:31.698
Tennie, who is taking
my daughter to prom?

1:24:33.398 --> 1:24:34.533
So,

1:24:36.601 --> 1:24:38.836
I do have a guy in mind.

1:24:38.838 --> 1:24:40.971
You do? Good.

1:24:40.973 --> 1:24:42.039
All right.

1:24:42.041 --> 1:24:45.275
But there's a tiny problem.

1:24:45.277 --> 1:24:46.576
Problem? What problem?

1:24:46.578 --> 1:24:48.511
- It's kind of your fault.
- My fault?

1:24:48.513 --> 1:24:50.650
No. Come on, who is the guy?

1:24:53.853 --> 1:24:54.785
It's Jack.

1:24:54.787 --> 1:24:56.553
No!

1:24:56.555 --> 1:24:58.022
Not him.

1:24:58.024 --> 1:24:59.624
Please.

1:25:00.059 --> 1:25:01.426
No way.

1:25:02.061 --> 1:25:03.627
Come on.

1:25:03.629 --> 1:25:04.829
Dad, you fired him.

1:25:04.831 --> 1:25:08.531
What do you mean I fired him?
Come on, I did it for you.

1:25:08.533 --> 1:25:09.399
- What did I do?
- Because...

1:25:09.401 --> 1:25:10.803
I had to get your
attention somehow.

1:25:12.437 --> 1:25:15.007
Okay, okay, you
got my attention.

1:25:16.075 --> 1:25:17.275
Now what?

1:25:17.977 --> 1:25:19.578
Have him ask me out to prom.

1:25:21.480 --> 1:25:24.815
No! I can't do that.

1:25:24.817 --> 1:25:26.083
Come on!

1:25:26.085 --> 1:25:27.452
Come on, dad.

1:25:30.990 --> 1:25:32.692
What are you... oh no.

1:25:37.462 --> 1:25:38.430
Jack.

1:25:39.699 --> 1:25:44.336
Are you willing to trade all the
days from this day to the next

1:25:45.004 --> 1:25:50.473
for a chance, just one chance to
come back here and tell our enemies

1:25:50.475 --> 1:25:52.544
that they may take our lives

1:25:53.813 --> 1:25:56.613
but they can never
take our freedom?

1:25:56.615 --> 1:25:58.651
Oh-God.

1:25:59.384 --> 1:26:00.987
So, how did you find me?

1:26:02.487 --> 1:26:03.854
Oh, Daniella.

1:26:03.856 --> 1:26:06.893
Daniella said
that you are in this

1:26:08.094 --> 1:26:09.327
performance?

1:26:10.562 --> 1:26:12.665
Well, obviously, you
didn't come for my acting.

1:26:14.599 --> 1:26:15.701
It was good.

1:26:16.434 --> 1:26:17.369
It was good.

1:26:17.904 --> 1:26:18.805
Really?

1:26:19.772 --> 1:26:21.874
What... what was... what
was your favorite part?

1:26:23.776 --> 1:26:26.712
Yeah, I... I would say the-

1:26:27.947 --> 1:26:34.086
the speech, the yelling, I mean the...
the part that you delivered.

1:26:35.620 --> 1:26:36.787
Yep.

1:26:36.789 --> 1:26:37.757
And?

1:26:41.661 --> 1:26:44.831
And it was a...

1:26:45.463 --> 1:26:47.633
How would I say... emotional,

1:26:48.533 --> 1:26:51.603
it was emotional and powerful.

1:26:52.939 --> 1:26:56.943
What you did back
there, it was powerful.

1:26:58.510 --> 1:27:03.448
And, listen, Di Caprio, I can't do
this, okay? I'm here for Tennie.

1:27:03.883 --> 1:27:06.917
Okay, I stayed away from her
just like you wanted me to.

1:27:06.919 --> 1:27:08.953
I kept my promise.
I protected her.

1:27:08.955 --> 1:27:11.824
I even punched that asshole in the
face for spreading rumors about her.

1:27:12.624 --> 1:27:14.058
- You did?
- Yeah.

1:27:14.060 --> 1:27:15.828
Why do you think they
returned your check?

1:27:17.063 --> 1:27:17.897
They did?

1:27:18.496 --> 1:27:19.362
Come on.

1:27:19.364 --> 1:27:22.367
Why are you really
here? Prom, right?

1:27:23.669 --> 1:27:24.971
There is a prom?

1:27:26.663 --> 1:27:27.580
Wait till you see the dress...

1:27:27.840 --> 1:27:29.642
You'll thank me later, okay?

1:27:35.114 --> 1:27:39.484
- Are they here yet?
- Wow, you're gorgeous.

1:27:40.820 --> 1:27:42.420
Just like your mother.

1:27:42.955 --> 1:27:43.990
Dad?

1:27:47.559 --> 1:27:48.928
Beautiful.

1:27:50.229 --> 1:27:51.729
I can't...

1:27:52.564 --> 1:27:54.734
Oh my God, it's
time, they're here!

1:27:56.669 --> 1:27:57.703
Come on, sweetie.

1:28:03.475 --> 1:28:05.475
My God, so excited.

1:28:05.477 --> 1:28:07.811
- Okay, ready? Pose.
- Is this good? Here we go.

1:28:07.813 --> 1:28:08.981
You're so cute.

1:28:10.983 --> 1:28:11.882
My lady.

1:28:11.884 --> 1:28:13.085
After you, Michelle.

1:28:14.186 --> 1:28:15.085
- Thanks, Aunt Melanie.
- You'll love Tennie.

1:28:15.087 --> 1:28:17.056
- She is awesome.
- Let me help you out.

1:28:19.557 --> 1:28:23.227
- Oh my God, Ten, you look so beautiful!
- You look really good.

1:28:23.229 --> 1:28:24.228
Excuse me.

1:28:24.230 --> 1:28:25.829
Michelle, look over here honey.

1:28:25.831 --> 1:28:28.134
Is this good?
Do I look good? Oh!

1:28:31.871 --> 1:28:33.105
Thank you.

1:28:34.173 --> 1:28:35.172
Here we go.

1:28:35.174 --> 1:28:38.608
- Quite a heavy hand.
- Tennie, this is Rachel.

1:28:38.610 --> 1:28:40.978
So you're the Tennie
I've heard so much about.

1:28:40.980 --> 1:28:42.880
I hope not everything.

1:28:42.882 --> 1:28:44.748
It's nice to finally meet you.

1:28:44.750 --> 1:28:47.019
Michelle, where is Jack?

1:28:47.585 --> 1:28:49.687
He said he's not
coming with us.

1:28:49.689 --> 1:28:50.821
- What?
- Who is Jack?

1:28:50.823 --> 1:28:53.092
- Oh my.
- What did you just say?

1:28:53.993 --> 1:28:55.893
He said he's coming
with his own car.

1:28:55.895 --> 1:28:57.495
Wait, what?

1:28:59.531 --> 1:29:02.134
Oh my God, it's a Saab!

1:29:03.903 --> 1:29:04.969
That's sick!

1:29:04.971 --> 1:29:07.740
Aunt Melanie, that's...

1:29:08.606 --> 1:29:09.974
So this is Jack.

1:29:09.976 --> 1:29:11.543
What a handsome young man.

1:29:14.313 --> 1:29:15.611
You look gorgeous.

1:29:15.613 --> 1:29:16.782
- Is that for me?
- Yeah.

1:29:17.283 --> 1:29:18.983
Thank you. It's beautiful.

1:29:18.985 --> 1:29:20.019
Yeah.

1:29:23.889 --> 1:29:25.490
That's my guy.

1:29:26.092 --> 1:29:27.860
Look here. Oh my God!

1:29:28.861 --> 1:29:31.128
Oh, they
look so cute together.

1:29:31.130 --> 1:29:32.963
- Bye.
- Bye.

1:29:32.965 --> 1:29:35.199
- Bye. Bye.
- See you guys there.

1:29:35.201 --> 1:29:36.300
Wait up girls, I'm coming.

1:29:36.302 --> 1:29:37.535
Melanie.

1:29:37.711 --> 1:29:38.920
Where are you going? Come!

1:29:40.139 --> 1:29:42.141
Never been to a prom, jeez.

1:29:42.674 --> 1:29:45.093
You didn’t let me go then…and you
are not letting me go now!

1:29:45.811 --> 1:29:49.313
- That's my family.
- Hey, guys, have a great night.

1:29:49.315 --> 1:29:50.649
Thanks, Robert.

1:29:51.751 --> 1:29:53.551
Hope you're okay
with the convertible.

1:29:54.286 --> 1:29:56.586
- All right. You excited?
- Yeah.

1:29:56.588 --> 1:29:57.721
Me, too.

1:29:57.723 --> 1:29:59.191
- You look great.
- Thank you.

1:30:00.159 --> 1:30:01.927
Hope you have somebody
following them.

1:30:02.862 --> 1:30:04.529
Fo... why?

1:30:05.798 --> 1:30:09.534
You can't trust kids this age,
especially teenage girls.

1:30:11.804 --> 1:30:13.706
Why am I listening to you?

1:30:14.306 --> 1:30:15.775
You don't even have kids.

1:30:16.175 --> 1:30:17.777
You're not even married.

1:30:23.816 --> 1:30:25.718
You live on the other side.

1:30:27.520 --> 1:30:31.556
<i>When I said all of this was the
beginning of the worst time in my life,</i>

1:30:32.758 --> 1:30:35.127
<i>I might have been
stretching it a bit.</i>

1:30:36.262 --> 1:30:38.664
<i>Did it turn out to
be the best time?</i>

1:30:39.131 --> 1:30:40.565
<i>Absolutely.</i>

1:30:41.233 --> 1:30:42.101
Dad.

1:30:49.642 --> 1:30:50.976
You make me happy, Dad.

1:30:55.848 --> 1:30:57.216
I love you, too.

1:31:14.433 --> 1:31:17.870
Hi. My name is Robert Grigorian.

1:31:18.270 --> 1:31:19.839
Hi, Robert.

1:31:24.210 --> 1:31:29.081
My name is Robert Grigorian
and I'm an alcoholic.

1:31:31.383 --> 1:31:34.284
- Was it good? Was it good?
- Yeah.

1:31:34.286 --> 1:31:35.185
All right.

1:31:35.187 --> 1:31:37.020
Oh crap, I'm late.

1:31:37.022 --> 1:31:38.090
Wish me good luck.

1:31:38.691 --> 1:31:39.857
- Good luck, Dad.
- All right.
