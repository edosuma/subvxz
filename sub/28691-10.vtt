Matt Shade!

00:16.684 --> 00:18.934
It is you.

00:18.936 --> 00:21.603
Stefani Tadson, huge fan,
reporter for> Flashback.

00:21.605 --> 00:23.939
Yeah, sure,
the sports lifestyle show.

00:23.941 --> 00:25.941
Yeah, where are they now?
They being you.

00:25.943 --> 00:28.894
And where are you? Clearly still
in hella great shape.

00:28.896 --> 00:30.863
Yeah, thanks.

00:30.865 --> 00:33.185
I swear I was just putting
together a reel the other day,

00:33.209 --> 00:36.869
and there's you playing against
Sacramento in the quarterfinals.

00:36.871 --> 00:39.655
You got your own rebound
off the goalpost

00:39.657 --> 00:41.623
to score the game winner.
It was legendary!

00:41.625 --> 00:43.325
Yeah. Well, you know your stuff.

00:43.327 --> 00:45.327
I don't want to ambush,
but I'd love to do

00:45.329 --> 00:47.449
a piece on you. You know what?
Don't say anything now,

00:47.473 --> 00:51.442
just take my card.
Call me later.

00:58.642 --> 01:00.426
Hey.

01:00.428 --> 01:03.062
Hello, it's Angela. Angie.

01:03.064 --> 01:06.014
I think we've met. Matthew.
Some people call me Matt.

01:06.016 --> 01:07.966
I haven't had coffee yet.

01:09.820 --> 01:11.820
What's up?

01:11.822 --> 01:14.302
A case for us. Supposed to meet
her at the St. Lucius Hospital.

01:14.326 --> 01:17.609
- OK. I'll pick you up.
- Cool! Yeah, cool!

01:17.611 --> 01:20.696
Coolio!

01:22.366 --> 01:24.450
I am about to blow your mind.

01:24.452 --> 01:27.202
Jujubes? Not just candy,

01:27.204 --> 01:29.488
my fruit guy told me - and yes,
before we continue,

01:32.460 --> 01:34.877
Something's off. I can sense it.

01:34.879 --> 01:36.845
Allergies?

01:36.847 --> 01:39.214
No. It's you and Shade.

01:39.216 --> 01:41.016
Did you guys have a fight?

01:41.018 --> 01:43.936
Was staying at his place
the worst? My. God.

01:43.938 --> 01:45.938
Did you accidentally
see each other naked?

01:45.940 --> 01:49.108
What? No. Everything's fine,
we are fine,

01:49.110 --> 01:52.430
and there's a very important case on the
docket that requires all of your attention.

01:52.454 --> 01:55.405
- Got it. What's the case?
- I have no idea.

01:59.036 --> 02:01.686
So earlier this morning,
two patrol cops found

02:01.688 --> 02:05.524
this guy in a park.
No I.D., no phone, no shoes.

02:05.526 --> 02:07.960
- Someone had a rough night.
- Or a really good one.

02:07.962 --> 02:10.202
Anyway, we have no idea
who he is, and neither does he.

02:10.226 --> 02:12.080
- Amnesia?
- It looks like that.

02:12.082 --> 02:14.133
Also, his fingerprints
aren't in the system.

02:14.135 --> 02:17.052
Um, we should talk
about the other night.

02:17.054 --> 02:19.805
Yeah...
Thank God for Don, right?

02:19.807 --> 02:21.807
Pretty much saved us
from making the worst decision

02:21.809 --> 02:24.643
of our lives. Am I right?

02:24.645 --> 02:26.512
Sure.

02:26.514 --> 02:29.097
Sir, no, no. You can't.
You can't get up.

02:33.854 --> 02:35.320
Mark?

02:35.322 --> 02:36.989
- Who's Mark?
- He's been mentioning

02:36.991 --> 02:39.241
that name a few times. This is

02:39.243 --> 02:41.160
Angie Everett and Matt Shade.

02:41.162 --> 02:44.163
Do you recognize either of them?
Only as humans.

02:46.667 --> 02:48.917
- It's funny.
- Have you two

02:48.919 --> 02:51.119
- ever seen this man before?
- No.

02:51.121 --> 02:53.705
- Never? Are you sure?
- We're sure we've never seen him, why?

02:53.707 --> 02:56.592
According to this, he knows you.

03:39.470 --> 03:42.221
Every body tells a story.
X-Ray show that,

03:42.223 --> 03:44.623
over the years, you've broken
nearly every bone in your body.

03:44.647 --> 03:46.725
Maybe he was a boxer.

03:46.727 --> 03:49.094
- Were you. A. Boxer?
- He lost

03:49.096 --> 03:52.814
his memory, not his hearing.
But that was kind of adorable.

03:52.816 --> 03:55.067
Over the past 24 hours,
he's suffered some bruising

03:55.069 --> 03:57.269
to his back and to his hips,
but it was head trauma that

03:57.293 --> 04:00.105
caused the retrograde amnesia.
Do you know when he'll get

04:00.107 --> 04:01.990
his memory back? Great question.

04:01.992 --> 04:04.273
Unfortunately, no way of
knowing when or to what extent.

04:04.297 --> 04:06.478
We'll do an MRI,
but if there's no brain damage,

04:06.480 --> 04:10.082
he'll be released in a day
or two. I'll check in later.

04:12.119 --> 04:15.420
That's Texas.
Is that where you're from?

04:15.422 --> 04:18.540
- You got me.
- So, this is his casefile

04:18.541 --> 04:21.375
and the only other piece
of evidence found on his person.

04:21.378 --> 04:23.428
What is that,
a paperclip bracelet?

04:23.430 --> 04:26.932
He was found here.
So, if you could

04:26.934 --> 04:28.934
figure out who this man is
and report back to me...

04:28.936 --> 04:31.770
- You're hiring us?
- No. I...

04:31.772 --> 04:33.772
You're doing this
out of the goodness

04:33.774 --> 04:37.976
of your hearts, pro bono.

04:37.978 --> 04:40.479
Pro-no-no. See?
We don't do free.

04:40.481 --> 04:42.481
Me neither.

04:42.483 --> 04:45.067
But in the last two months,
I have for license plates,

04:45.069 --> 04:47.069
I have for traffic footage,

04:47.071 --> 04:49.454
on addition to taking on
Maz's entire workload

04:49.456 --> 04:51.022
and a whole string
of thefts of my own

04:51.024 --> 04:53.542
that I am not even close
to solving,

04:53.544 --> 04:55.544
so pay up.

04:57.715 --> 05:00.832
- We'll take it.
- Thank you.

05:00.834 --> 05:03.585
Good luck.

05:03.587 --> 05:05.554
Hey, we're gonna need
to call you something.

05:05.556 --> 05:07.556
What about Tex?

05:07.558 --> 05:10.375
- I like it.
- Cool. Say cheese.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.232
Did you really need a souvenir?

05:17.234 --> 05:20.569
What? I'm sending it to Zoe,
so she can put it

05:20.571 --> 05:22.971
in the missing persons database,
and maybe we'll get a match.

05:22.995 --> 05:24.990
- That is a good idea.
- Why do you think

05:24.992 --> 05:27.492
Tex had our card on him?
Maybe he wanted to hire us.

05:27.494 --> 05:29.361
Which means
he could be in danger.

05:29.363 --> 05:32.247
Or was just trying to find out
if his wife was cheating on him.

05:32.249 --> 05:34.499
Wife? No. I didn't see a ring.

05:34.501 --> 05:37.419
Plus, he's got a sort of
single vibe, don't you think?

05:39.923 --> 05:42.257
Green Gully Park,
this is the place.

05:48.349 --> 05:50.932
Did you find anything yet?

05:50.934 --> 05:52.801
- Nada. You?
- No.

05:52.803 --> 05:54.686
Are you sure
we've got the right spot?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.888
I know how to read a map.

06:00.927 --> 06:02.861
It's over there.

06:02.863 --> 06:06.398
Wait. Shade, check it out.

06:12.406 --> 06:14.122
Paperclips?

06:14.124 --> 06:16.458
Yep, and there's more.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.917
- Mystery man 10 o'clock.
- Check out his shoes,

06:25.919 --> 06:28.503
- they're brand new.
- Shall we?

06:35.345 --> 06:38.764
Thieves! I saw you take my keys!

06:38.766 --> 06:40.766
We're not here
to steal anything.

06:40.768 --> 06:44.436
- We just have some questions.
- Sister, you're one of us.

06:44.438 --> 06:46.354
Are you from the future
or the past?

06:46.356 --> 06:49.991
The future.
And I brought a friend.

06:49.993 --> 06:53.078
Excellent! Step into my office.

06:55.666 --> 06:58.283
Now, tell me what you seek.

06:58.285 --> 07:01.453
- We're looking for this guy.
- The broken man.

07:01.455 --> 07:04.790
He tumbled down the hill.
Perhaps out of a portal.

07:04.792 --> 07:06.792
He had no key, so I traded.

07:06.794 --> 07:09.177
The paperclips for his shoes?

07:09.179 --> 07:12.514
- A fair trade.
- He came from up there?

07:14.518 --> 07:17.803
The buzzers and honkers
will spit you out.

07:17.805 --> 07:18.970
Here.

07:20.808 --> 07:22.390
Take this.

07:22.392 --> 07:25.527
Key to the portals,
so you can return to the future

07:25.529 --> 07:28.396
and the life you choose.
Here you go.

07:28.398 --> 07:32.567
- No, no, I couldn't.
- Fair trade for your help.

07:32.569 --> 07:34.536
Thank you, future man.

07:44.047 --> 07:46.798
Buzzers and honkers,
they'll spit you out?

07:46.800 --> 07:48.967
They'll spit you out.
And here I thought

07:48.969 --> 07:51.169
your poetry-slam days
were behind you.

07:51.171 --> 07:53.171
There's no crosswalks,
no sidewalks.

07:53.173 --> 07:55.140
I mean, what was
Tex even doing here?

07:55.142 --> 07:58.760
Yeah. Skid marks.

07:58.762 --> 08:01.429
And a traffic camera.
Call Danica, see

08:01.431 --> 08:03.849
if she can pull up the footage.
Alright.

08:07.888 --> 08:10.405
Matt Shade.

08:10.407 --> 08:12.157
That was quick.

08:12.159 --> 08:15.160
So was your message.
Man of few words.

08:15.162 --> 08:17.028
I like to get to the point.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.748
Care to prove that tonight?

08:19.750 --> 08:21.710
Yeah, we typically do
a couple of pre-interviews

08:21.712 --> 08:23.912
before we start putting
the show together. Are you game?

08:23.936 --> 08:25.704
Dinner's on me.

08:25.706 --> 08:27.956
If she can get footage
of the traffic coming

08:27.958 --> 08:30.292
from both directions.
Yeah. Tonight would be great.

08:30.294 --> 08:32.344
No, tonight's terrible,
we need this stuff now!

08:32.346 --> 08:35.881
- I'm interrupting.
- Yeah, I'm kind of in the middle of something.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.923
Why don't you send me a text,
we'll work it out, OK?

08:37.947 --> 08:40.018
OK. See you later. Ciao.

08:40.020 --> 08:42.636
Well, are we getting
the footage or not?

08:42.639 --> 08:45.607
That wasn't Danica.

08:45.609 --> 08:47.025
It was a reporter.

08:47.027 --> 08:50.645
She's interviewing me
for> Flashback, the TV show.

08:50.647 --> 08:54.366
You know, you don't have to lie,
it's OK if you're going on a date.

08:54.368 --> 08:56.284
No, it's not a date.
Fans wanna know

08:56.286 --> 08:58.206
where I've been all these years,
where I'm going.

08:58.230 --> 09:00.906
- You're going somewhere?
- Where I am,

09:00.908 --> 09:03.575
- what I'm doing now.
- OK.

09:03.577 --> 09:06.545
I'm gonna go visit Tex, and I'm
gonna talk him through what we found.

09:06.547 --> 09:08.907
You go to the cop shop and see
if Danica can dig up footage.

09:08.909 --> 09:11.269
- Alright. I'll give you a ride.
- No. Don't worry about it.

09:11.293 --> 09:13.266
It's out of your way.
I'll take a cab.

09:17.090 --> 09:19.808
There he is.

09:22.312 --> 09:24.396
What are you waiting for?

09:24.398 --> 09:26.815
Angie? Isn't...

09:26.817 --> 09:28.817
Don't you two always
roll together?

09:28.819 --> 09:31.570
Isn't she like the Batman
to your Robin?

09:31.572 --> 09:34.406
Or the Tegan to your Sara?

09:34.408 --> 09:36.741
Or the Virtue to your Moir?

09:36.743 --> 09:40.528
OK, first of all,
I'm Batman, OK? Me.

09:40.530 --> 09:43.248
Secondly, we're not
joined at the hip.

09:43.250 --> 09:45.083
OK.

09:48.488 --> 09:51.206
- My God!
- Wow!

09:51.208 --> 09:53.008
Well, that explains
the injuries.

10:00.567 --> 10:04.519
There's a special place in Hell
for people who hit and run.

10:04.521 --> 10:06.321
OK, I got a clear shot
at the license plate.

10:10.210 --> 10:12.477
- I'm gonna run it.
- I'm gonna text the photo

10:12.479 --> 10:15.897
of that woman to Angie,
see if Tex recognizes her.

10:15.899 --> 10:18.700
I was being chased.

10:18.702 --> 10:20.619
I wonder if I know her.

10:20.621 --> 10:22.621
If you do, I would

10:22.623 --> 10:25.356
consider making new friends.

10:25.358 --> 10:27.042
What's this?

10:27.044 --> 10:30.211
"5 of diamonds, 54, song bowl."

10:30.213 --> 10:32.464
I've been writing down
anything that pops into my head.

10:32.466 --> 10:34.499
It's mostly gibberish.

10:34.501 --> 10:38.086
"Brown-eyed girl," someone you know?
Maybe that's you.

10:39.756 --> 10:42.507
At least we know you're a flirt.

10:42.509 --> 10:46.394
Hey.

10:46.396 --> 10:49.097
Yeah, sure, I'm on my way.
Talk to you later.

10:49.099 --> 10:50.649
Yeah.

10:50.651 --> 10:53.601
You won't tell
my parents, will you?

10:53.603 --> 10:56.104
They'll kill me if they know
I borrowed their car

10:56.106 --> 10:58.440
to pick up Trish.
But she's so dramatic.

10:58.442 --> 11:00.442
Like, if we didn't get in
on the university's

11:00.444 --> 11:02.494
scavenger hunt,
we'd be ruined, right?

11:02.496 --> 11:04.496
I have a whole new appreciation

11:04.498 --> 11:08.166
for Jules right now.
The emotions just keep coming.

11:08.168 --> 11:10.785
I'm super freaking out.

11:10.787 --> 11:14.255
Well, you did hit
someone with your car.

11:14.257 --> 11:17.208
Am I going to jail?!

11:17.210 --> 11:19.243
Could you just tell us
what happened?

11:23.800 --> 11:26.351
Yeah. I want to preface this
by saying

11:26.353 --> 11:28.353
I was for sure
going the speed limit, OK?

11:28.355 --> 11:30.555
OK. Super OK.

11:30.557 --> 11:33.608
So I'm driving,

11:33.610 --> 11:35.777
and something just runs out
in front of me.

11:35.779 --> 11:38.897
And I think it's a deer or
something. It's so fast, right?

11:38.899 --> 11:41.700
So I get out of the car,
and I see that it's this guy.

11:41.702 --> 11:45.403
And he's tough and scowly.

11:45.405 --> 11:48.123
But also super cute,
which is confusing, right?

11:48.125 --> 11:51.242
But then I see it, and I'm like,

11:51.244 --> 11:53.211
"Nope." So I get

11:53.213 --> 11:55.246
in my car and drive off.

11:55.248 --> 11:57.916
"See it"? What did you see?

11:57.918 --> 12:00.802
The gun!

12:06.043 --> 12:08.093
Driver of the car
was pretty clear.

12:08.095 --> 12:10.295
A hysterical 20-year-old
who just got in a hit and run

12:10.319 --> 12:12.264
isn't exactly
a reliable witness.

12:12.266 --> 12:14.800
If the gun is here, we can
run it through ballistics,

12:14.802 --> 12:16.802
see if it's been used
in any crimes,

12:16.804 --> 12:19.471
maybe find out who Tex is.
Why crimes?

12:19.473 --> 12:22.557
- That's what criminals do.
- You think Tex is a criminal?

12:22.559 --> 12:25.393
- Ooh, if the gun fits...
- He could be a cop.

12:25.395 --> 12:28.864
- His prints would be on file.
- Yeah, the same place they'd be if he was a criminal.

12:28.866 --> 12:32.200
He said he was being chased. Maybe
because he was doing something illegal.

12:32.202 --> 12:34.903
- Like what?
- I don't know. Robbing,

12:34.905 --> 12:37.489
- stealing, stalking.
- OK, fine,

12:37.491 --> 12:39.524
so let's say
he might be a criminal.

12:39.526 --> 12:41.966
- That is what I've been saying.
- Why are you getting so mad?

12:41.990 --> 12:44.579
I'm not getting mad.

12:44.581 --> 12:47.299
Hey, Zoe. What do you got?

12:47.301 --> 12:50.418
I don't want to call myself
a genius, but I was staring

12:50.420 --> 12:53.338
at Tex's list of words,
and I started thinking,

12:53.340 --> 12:55.540
"What the heck-a-doodle
is the five of diamonds?"

12:55.542 --> 12:57.726
So I started digging,
and I found a bar

12:57.728 --> 12:59.728
called the Five of Diamonds.

12:59.730 --> 13:01.897
Well, a lot of thought
went into that one?

13:01.899 --> 13:04.180
How do we know that the words
Tex wrote refers to a bar?

13:06.153 --> 13:09.521
With the Five of Diamonds, and I got
a hit on the bar's Ameechee page.

13:09.523 --> 13:11.823
Sent you the address.

13:11.825 --> 13:14.826
Got it.

13:18.866 --> 13:21.500
- You were saying?
- Let's go.

13:28.926 --> 13:31.042
Ooh, I like this place.

13:33.931 --> 13:36.548
Hey, can I get you something?

13:36.550 --> 13:38.800
We're looking for
some answers. You know this guy?

13:38.802 --> 13:40.936
Who's asking?

13:40.938 --> 13:42.971
You're looking at him.

13:42.973 --> 13:45.106
- Who's he to you?
- Let's just say we're friends.

13:45.108 --> 13:48.560
- No. Never seen him.
- Can we speak to the manager?

13:48.562 --> 13:50.862
You just did, honey.

13:50.864 --> 13:52.898
And if you want to talk
to the owner, same guy.

13:52.900 --> 13:55.951
Alright. Do you mind if we show
this picture to some customers?

13:57.270 --> 13:59.287
Look, people come here

13:59.289 --> 14:01.740
to drink and relax,

14:01.742 --> 14:03.708
not to be hassled
by two strangers

14:03.710 --> 14:05.744
nosing their way in,
starting to ask questions.

14:08.465 --> 14:10.415
Guess that's a no.

14:17.841 --> 14:19.891
He definitely knows Tex.

14:19.893 --> 14:21.843
He's probably
calling him right now.

14:21.845 --> 14:23.511
On the phone we don't have.

14:23.513 --> 14:26.231
Probably a burner anyway.
How do you figure?

14:26.233 --> 14:28.233
Seedy bar, defensive bartender,

14:28.235 --> 14:30.852
not to mention gun.
You're being biased.

14:30.854 --> 14:32.904
In my opinion,
we do not have all the facts.

14:32.906 --> 14:34.739
Maybe our bartender
will make a move.

14:37.945 --> 14:40.579
What does your unbiased
opinion say about that?

14:49.456 --> 14:52.674
Hey, it's Colin. Are you in?

15:14.314 --> 15:16.781
OK, rationale
for breaking in, go.

15:16.783 --> 15:18.700
We've been hired
to find out who Tex is,

15:18.702 --> 15:20.702
and this might be his apartment.

15:20.704 --> 15:23.455
- We know there's no one inside.
- You know how to pick a lock.

15:37.721 --> 15:40.388
Well, it's a little sparse
for my taste.

15:40.390 --> 15:42.140
You think?

15:42.142 --> 15:44.643
"Two people came by looking
for you. I got descriptions."

15:44.645 --> 15:46.645
Definitely Tex's apartment.

15:55.822 --> 15:58.857
OK... Guess he's looking
for someone.

15:58.859 --> 16:01.860
Got a file here for "Green."

16:01.862 --> 16:04.529
Empty.

16:04.531 --> 16:07.615
I've got brass knuckles,
fake badges.

16:07.617 --> 16:09.668
Both of which scream
upstanding citizen.

16:09.670 --> 16:12.370
- OK, you win.
- Hey, maybe

16:12.372 --> 16:14.452
he's someone good who got
caught up in something bad.

16:14.476 --> 16:16.624
You don't need to make me
feel better about him.

16:16.626 --> 16:18.960
I don't think I could. Saw
the way you looked at the guy.

16:20.263 --> 16:21.846
- Potted plant.
- So?

16:21.848 --> 16:24.632
You see any other decorating
touches around this place?

16:26.520 --> 16:28.520
I'll check
the last number he dialed.

16:31.224 --> 16:36.277
Last number
dialed, 416-555-0184.

16:40.317 --> 16:44.119
Hey, boss. How's Sexy Texy?

16:44.121 --> 16:47.038
- What did I say about nicknames?
- My talents are wasted on you.

16:47.040 --> 16:50.709
Can you do a reverse lookup?
416-555-0184.

16:50.711 --> 16:52.744
OK. Hold on a sec.

16:56.299 --> 16:58.166
Hey, are you ready for this?

16:58.168 --> 17:00.168
Think I found a name
for our friend Tex.

17:00.170 --> 17:01.920
- Anthony Brown.
- Really?

17:01.922 --> 17:04.672
Never took him for a Tony.
No, you don't like that?

17:04.674 --> 17:06.558
How about Carter Smith?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.060
Lars Andersen? Ooh,

17:09.061 --> 17:10.979
Marty McDonner!

17:10.981 --> 17:14.566
What the... He's got
a half-dozen identities here.

17:14.568 --> 17:16.601
All top quality too,
professional.

17:16.603 --> 17:19.963
Just when you think you don't know someone,
you find out you really don't know them.

17:19.987 --> 17:22.073
- Who is this guy?
- Spy?

17:22.075 --> 17:24.075
Hitman? The real Jason Bourne?

17:26.530 --> 17:28.580
A Mark Green.
I'll text you his details.

17:28.582 --> 17:30.248
I'll call you back.

17:30.250 --> 17:33.151
OK, first time we meet Tex,
he thinks you're a guy

17:33.153 --> 17:36.204
named Mark and here we find
a file named Green.

17:36.206 --> 17:39.424
And knowing what we know about Tex
now, this Mark could be anyone.

17:39.426 --> 17:41.292
- Partner? Rival?
- Or a target.

17:41.294 --> 17:43.428
- I think we should call Danica.
- And say what?

17:43.430 --> 17:46.798
- You got a better idea?
- Yeah.

17:49.936 --> 17:51.970
- Mark Green?
- Yes.

17:51.972 --> 17:54.556
This is my wife Candice.

17:54.558 --> 17:56.191
- Take a seat.
- OK.

17:56.193 --> 17:59.277
What's this all about?
We know what you tried to do.

17:59.279 --> 18:01.896
We have proof.
What are they talking about?

18:01.898 --> 18:04.816
- I have no idea.
- We're talking about him.

18:04.818 --> 18:06.951
That's Ethan.

18:06.953 --> 18:09.120
He's in the hospital.
Is he... is he OK?

18:09.122 --> 18:11.206
Is he a friend? Family?

18:11.208 --> 18:13.825
No. He's
our private investigator.

18:19.274 --> 18:21.525
- Ethan Clarkson?
- Technically, it's

18:21.527 --> 18:24.811
Texas Ethan Clarkson.
Hey, you guessed my name.

18:24.813 --> 18:28.115
Well, you do have a tattoo of Texas,
it wasn't that much of a stretch.

18:28.117 --> 18:30.567
You own your own firm -

18:30.569 --> 18:33.153
T.C. Investigative Solutions.

18:33.155 --> 18:35.405
And Mark hired you
to find a stolen sketch.

18:35.407 --> 18:36.990
An original Egon Schiele.

18:36.992 --> 18:39.159
You have the picture.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.162
Geez, I'm such a clod!

18:42.164 --> 18:44.498
Thank you. Just shove it in.

18:47.970 --> 18:51.388
It was a wedding gift
from our families.

18:51.390 --> 18:53.256
At last appraisal,

18:53.258 --> 18:55.842
it was worth nearly $500,000.
Wow!

18:55.844 --> 18:58.145
So you called the police?

18:58.147 --> 19:01.481
They've had a few art thefts
recently. They said

19:01.483 --> 19:03.883
something like this gets sold
on the black market right away.

19:03.907 --> 19:05.519
It's probably gone forever.

19:05.521 --> 19:07.521
Maybe not.

19:07.523 --> 19:09.489
Tex may have been onto
something. There's gotta be

19:09.491 --> 19:12.809
a reason he was on Valley Road.
"Valley Road"?

19:12.811 --> 19:14.828
It's where
Intimate Intentions is.

19:14.830 --> 19:16.580
- What's that?
- It's a retreat.

19:16.582 --> 19:19.366
Candice and I have been
going there for a year

19:19.368 --> 19:22.485
to, recharge.

19:22.487 --> 19:24.504
We haven't been
in about three months.

19:24.506 --> 19:26.623
Anyone there know
that you own that sketch?

19:26.625 --> 19:29.676
Doctor Lisa is a collector.

19:29.678 --> 19:32.045
- Doctor?
- Intimate Intentions is

19:32.047 --> 19:34.631
a very special place.

19:34.633 --> 19:37.184
It's been a lifesaver for us.

19:39.138 --> 19:41.171
OK, I just texted
Danica about the sketch.

19:41.173 --> 19:44.333
I figured it might have something to do
with the string of thefts she mentioned.

19:44.357 --> 19:46.991
Good call.

19:56.788 --> 20:00.407
"Intimate Intentions," it's
a little on the nose, isn't it?

20:00.409 --> 20:02.409
It's a little on something.

20:02.411 --> 20:05.078
- Let's just make this quick.
- That's what he said.

20:12.804 --> 20:15.255
Welcome to Intimate Intentions.

20:15.257 --> 20:17.257
We'd like to speak to Dr. Lisa.

20:17.259 --> 20:19.092
She's fully booked today.

20:19.094 --> 20:21.494
Is there any other way I can
make your day more sex positive?

20:21.518 --> 20:24.147
No, we're good.

20:24.149 --> 20:27.434
- OK.
- How can you say that, Matthew?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.736
When are you gonna start
being honest with yourself?

20:29.738 --> 20:32.439
With me, for once?

20:32.441 --> 20:35.275
- I'm... sorry.
- Do you need a tissue?

20:35.277 --> 20:38.111
No! What we need is help!
We need a miracle!

20:38.113 --> 20:40.914
We need Dr. Lisa!

20:40.916 --> 20:43.200
I can't breathe.
Let me see what I can do.

20:43.202 --> 20:45.835
- Help me.
- Yeah, yeah.

20:49.258 --> 20:51.875
So this is
an emergency appointment,

20:51.877 --> 20:53.877
so let's just jump right in.

20:53.879 --> 20:55.879
How long have you two
been together?

20:55.881 --> 20:57.881
- Two years.
- Three years.

20:57.883 --> 21:01.051
OK... And how's your sex life?

21:04.856 --> 21:07.757
OK, we've struck a nerve.

21:07.759 --> 21:10.477
You can talk freely.
What's this about?

21:10.479 --> 21:13.863
Matthew, you first.

21:13.865 --> 21:17.400
Well...

21:17.402 --> 21:19.736
what it's been about,

21:19.738 --> 21:22.239
for a while,

21:22.241 --> 21:25.208
is... whether or not

21:25.210 --> 21:27.294
we should...

21:28.880 --> 21:30.880
get one of those.

21:30.882 --> 21:33.083
A sex swing?

21:33.085 --> 21:35.919
They can be liberating,

21:35.921 --> 21:37.971
but intimidating.

21:37.973 --> 21:40.340
Let's talk about what it means
for you to have one.

21:40.342 --> 21:43.176
I, I don't really think.

21:43.178 --> 21:45.312
Mr. Inflexible over here
could handle it.

21:45.314 --> 21:47.731
- Stretching could help.
- No,

21:47.733 --> 21:50.684
I'm talking about anything new.
Change is not his thing.

21:50.686 --> 21:53.019
Since when is change
not my thing?

21:53.021 --> 21:55.905
Don't you remember
"Meat-free Mondays" experiments?

21:55.907 --> 21:58.158
Threw off his whole week.
I know what I want,

21:58.160 --> 22:01.578
and I go for it. You, one minute you're
into the swing; Next minute, not at all.

22:01.580 --> 22:03.500
Well, it takes me a while
to figure things out.

22:03.502 --> 22:05.422
The swing's a big deal,
I wanna be sure about it.

22:05.446 --> 22:06.866
Let's try an exercise.

22:06.868 --> 22:09.286
Thinking in context
of the swing,

22:09.288 --> 22:11.371
why don't you tell each other
why you're afraid?

22:11.373 --> 22:14.207
And use the phrase "I am afraid".

22:21.133 --> 22:23.717
I am afraid

22:23.719 --> 22:26.853
that if we... get the swing,

22:26.855 --> 22:29.856
then everything in our lives
will be about the swing.

22:29.858 --> 22:31.775
There will be
all these expectations,

22:31.777 --> 22:33.777
and the pressure
will be too much.

22:33.779 --> 22:36.279
Good. Now, Matthew,

22:36.281 --> 22:39.616
tell Angela why you're nervous
about getting a swing.

22:41.570 --> 22:43.703
I am afraid

22:43.705 --> 22:47.157
that I'll screw it up.

22:47.159 --> 22:49.576
I've had swings before,

22:49.578 --> 22:51.628
and I always seem to break them.

22:51.630 --> 22:54.381
So you're assuming
that you'd break

22:54.383 --> 22:56.383
the swing? Holy arrogance!

22:56.385 --> 22:59.886
You won't even talk about the swing.
So where does that leave me?

22:59.888 --> 23:01.808
I'm not gonna wait around
to get a swing forever.

23:04.226 --> 23:07.143
- I think we've gone off course.
- Could I get a glass

23:07.145 --> 23:09.185
of water, please? I think
I just... I need a moment.

23:16.071 --> 23:18.738
- Angie...
- Just cover the door.

23:18.740 --> 23:20.774
I'm gonna check her schedule.

23:23.612 --> 23:27.030
I really think

23:27.032 --> 23:29.699
we need to talk about this.
I think we just did.

23:32.254 --> 23:35.872
It's a dead end anyway. She was in Chicago
the same week the sketch was stolen.

23:43.382 --> 23:45.632
We're out of time,

23:45.634 --> 23:48.418
but I think we should put
something in the books.

23:48.420 --> 23:51.354
You both have
a lot more to talk about.

24:03.268 --> 24:06.119
Shhh! Do you hear that?
That ringing sound?

24:06.121 --> 24:08.488
No, it's a singing sound.
Song bowls,

24:08.490 --> 24:11.958
it was on Tex's list.

24:11.960 --> 24:14.744
Reaching forward,

24:14.746 --> 24:17.630
letting those hips sink
into the ground.

24:17.632 --> 24:19.833
We are in the right place.

24:19.835 --> 24:22.001
Letting in that breath deep.

24:22.003 --> 24:23.753
Hello?

24:23.755 --> 24:26.473
Yeah, sure, we got it.

24:26.475 --> 24:29.476
OK. That was Danica.
Tex is being

24:29.478 --> 24:31.478
released from the hospital;
We can pick him up.

24:31.480 --> 24:33.980
I can't, I got that interview

24:33.982 --> 24:36.149
with that> Flashback reporter.
Right.

24:36.151 --> 24:38.151
- I could cancel.
- No, no, no.

24:38.153 --> 24:41.154
I can handle Tex. You go.
Be interviewed. Have fun.

24:47.279 --> 24:50.163
This is cute.

24:50.165 --> 24:52.916
My dad owns it.
It's kind of my go-to.

24:52.918 --> 24:55.818
Let's start
with your new career.

24:55.820 --> 24:57.003
What drew you to the PI life?

24:57.005 --> 24:59.339
OK. Well, it was

24:59.341 --> 25:01.374
a young hockey prospect
that I'd scouted

25:01.376 --> 25:03.326
who I was hoping
would get drafted.

25:03.328 --> 25:05.261
His career was being sabotaged.

25:05.263 --> 25:08.715
I was investigating it,
and that's when I met Angie.

25:08.717 --> 25:11.384
Everett. Owner
of the Everett Agency. OK.

25:11.386 --> 25:13.436
Now, did you and Angie
hit it off immediately?

25:13.438 --> 25:15.305
No. Not at all.

25:15.307 --> 25:17.474
In fact, she warned,

25:17.476 --> 25:19.526
threatened, demanded
that I back off.

25:19.528 --> 25:22.695
So you pursued her then?
Professionally, I mean.

25:22.697 --> 25:25.365
Well, when I see
something I want, I go after it.

25:25.367 --> 25:28.902
OK. So you and Angie, what
makes you two such a great team?

25:31.356 --> 25:33.356
We're honest with each other,

25:33.358 --> 25:36.326
and she's smart, funny,
easy to be around.

25:36.328 --> 25:39.245
- Like a match made in heaven.
- Haha! Yeah, you'd think, wouldn't you?

25:39.247 --> 25:42.665
- What do you mean?
- Nothing.

25:42.667 --> 25:46.219
Haha! You know, let's...
let's just go all the way back

25:46.221 --> 25:49.038
to a young hockey player
barely out of his teens

25:49.040 --> 25:51.424
first hitting the big leagues.
Day one, tell me about it.

25:53.011 --> 25:55.428
OK, it says here

25:55.430 --> 25:57.347
that you help locate sculptures

25:57.349 --> 26:00.216
ancient texts, a Fabergé egg.

26:00.218 --> 26:02.718
You specialize
in lost and stolen art,

26:02.720 --> 26:06.022
which explains
all your fake identities.

26:06.024 --> 26:09.359
Look, you also live
on the West Coast.

26:09.361 --> 26:11.361
- "Seattle."
- I've heard it's beautiful.

26:11.363 --> 26:13.363
- Do you kayak?
- No.

26:13.365 --> 26:15.748
'Cause I do. Once with whales.

26:15.750 --> 26:17.950
This is working. Things are
starting to come back to me.

26:17.974 --> 26:20.036
I told you we'd find
stuff on the Web.

26:20.038 --> 26:23.540
- You're a genius. More.
- Alright...

26:23.542 --> 26:25.675
Wow!

26:25.677 --> 26:27.677
You were a cop.

26:27.679 --> 26:30.713
I remember drugs...

26:30.715 --> 26:33.132
Was I a dirty cop?
No. No, no, no, no.

26:33.134 --> 26:35.518
Undercover.
You were instrumental

26:35.520 --> 26:37.554
in bringing down
a major drug ring.

26:37.556 --> 26:39.922
And that's why your fingerprints
were never on file.

26:39.924 --> 26:41.975
I lived in Colombia.

26:41.977 --> 26:44.060
Damn, this article
blew my cover,

26:44.062 --> 26:47.730
it killed my whole career.
But it made Britney happy.

26:47.732 --> 26:50.817
- Britney?
- My little sister.

26:52.871 --> 26:54.871
Hey, you know what?

26:54.873 --> 26:57.907
I just remembered
something else.

26:57.909 --> 26:59.909
I'm single.

27:04.049 --> 27:06.132
Refill?

27:08.887 --> 27:11.287
You know, this is not fair.
You know so much about me,

27:11.289 --> 27:13.306
and I really know
nothing about you.

27:13.308 --> 27:15.892
I'm pretty basic.

27:18.513 --> 27:20.563
Let's see. Let's see

27:20.565 --> 27:23.399
if I'm as good a detective
as the Internet says.

27:23.401 --> 27:25.768
OK. Shoot.

27:25.770 --> 27:28.321
Judging by the placement
of your father's

27:28.323 --> 27:30.990
mementoes, says you two had

27:30.992 --> 27:33.526
a pretty strong bond,

27:33.528 --> 27:36.362
but the crumpled sticky on your
fridge reminding you to call Mom

27:36.364 --> 27:40.283
speaks to...
a strained relationship.

27:40.285 --> 27:43.703
Batch of melatonin on
the counter speaks to insomnia.

27:43.705 --> 27:46.956
And the fact that you have
old Everett Agency letterhead

27:46.958 --> 27:48.925
floating around,

27:48.927 --> 27:51.344
that means you haven't had
a partner for very long.

27:51.346 --> 27:53.212
Aren't you just
a regular Cumberbatch.

27:53.214 --> 27:56.849
And you're also smart,
witty, a little clumsy.

27:56.851 --> 28:00.053
- And you got that from...?
- Watching you.

28:00.055 --> 28:02.939
Not in a creepy way.

28:05.226 --> 28:08.010
And now, I bet I can guess

28:08.012 --> 28:10.813
what you do
when you can't sleep.

28:13.201 --> 28:14.534
Research.

28:31.704 --> 28:34.705
- Good morning!
- Hey!

28:34.707 --> 28:36.707
Someone engine's
running this morning.

28:36.709 --> 28:39.293
- Ask me how my night was.
- Pretend I just did.

28:39.295 --> 28:40.845
Fabulous!

28:40.847 --> 28:44.515
- Hey, Shade.
- Hey.

28:44.517 --> 28:46.600
Angie, toothbrush?

28:46.602 --> 28:48.436
Bottom left drawer.

28:48.438 --> 28:50.805
Got it.

28:50.807 --> 28:53.140
So, Tex spent the night?

28:53.142 --> 28:56.360
No. Yes, but not like that.

28:56.362 --> 28:58.562
We got caught up doing research.
Is that what the kids

28:58.586 --> 29:01.282
are calling it these days?
Check it out.

29:01.284 --> 29:04.318
Mark and Candice used to go
to Intimate Intentions, right?

29:04.320 --> 29:06.120
Turns out they took yoga

29:06.122 --> 29:09.073
from Mateo Navarro.
I think he's scamming them.

29:09.075 --> 29:11.375
- Based on what?
- Before he was

29:11.377 --> 29:13.377
a yoga instructor,
he was getting his Masters

29:13.379 --> 29:16.964
in 20th century European art,
which of course includes...

29:16.966 --> 29:20.468
The stolen sketch
that Tex was hired to find.

29:24.807 --> 29:28.058
Zoe just texted. Her and Tex are
on their way over to his apartment.

29:28.060 --> 29:30.511
Hopefully, they find
some clues in there.

29:32.982 --> 29:36.350
- You certainly look the part.
- I've done yoga before.

29:36.352 --> 29:38.319
Really?

29:38.321 --> 29:41.522
OK, fine. The mat's Zoe's.
I'll see you after class,

29:41.524 --> 29:43.240
and be careful.

29:43.242 --> 29:45.409
Yeah. I'm just gonna
poke around Mateo's office.

29:45.411 --> 29:48.028
Child's play. Angie...

29:49.582 --> 29:51.165
Namaste.

29:53.369 --> 29:55.252
Knees bent

29:55.254 --> 29:58.038
as we sweep the arms overhead.

29:58.040 --> 30:00.541
Draw in the belly.

30:02.628 --> 30:05.846
And sink into the hips.

30:05.848 --> 30:08.382
Remember, our hips
are the centre

30:08.384 --> 30:10.918
of our sexuality.

30:10.920 --> 30:13.754
Yeah, you're very tight.
Geez, buy a girl

30:13.756 --> 30:16.557
- a drink first.
- Better.

30:16.559 --> 30:19.527
Do you feel that?
It's vaguely familiar.

30:19.529 --> 30:22.930
Yeah. The hips
are opening, lubricating.

30:22.932 --> 30:25.032
The name that comes
to mind is...?

30:25.034 --> 30:28.702
I'm gonna say Gavin. I don't
really know, it's been a while.

30:28.704 --> 30:31.789
Psoas. Our hip-flexors.

30:31.791 --> 30:33.407
Haha!

30:34.911 --> 30:37.044
Of course.

31:03.489 --> 31:06.273
You realize that a person's space
is a reflection of their mind?

31:06.275 --> 31:08.809
Yeah. We're in trouble then.

31:08.811 --> 31:11.612
Well, first thing on my radar:
Your phone.

31:11.614 --> 31:13.480
Which I don't keep
in my computer.

31:13.482 --> 31:15.449
No. But if you're smart,

31:15.451 --> 31:19.119
and I suspect you are, tall,
good looking, funny, first born,

31:19.121 --> 31:21.088
all scientifically proven signs,

31:21.090 --> 31:24.458
then you will have downloaded an
online tracker for your phone.

31:24.460 --> 31:27.711
- You're a little weird.
- Angie says the exact same thing.

31:27.713 --> 31:30.330
If someone was one of a kind,
my grandmother would say

31:30.332 --> 31:32.299
they were a "One."

31:32.301 --> 31:35.052
Angie's a "One."
Matt Shade's a lucky man.

31:35.054 --> 31:37.771
Shade? No, no, no, no.
She and Shade are

31:37.773 --> 31:40.107
just business partners.
So she's single?

31:40.109 --> 31:42.476
Embarrassingly so.

31:42.478 --> 31:44.528
Yet don't tell her I said that.

31:51.070 --> 31:52.987
- What?
- Your phone,

31:52.989 --> 31:56.206
you're never gonna
guess where it is.

31:57.693 --> 32:01.495
You mean in this very office
where I'm standing right now?

32:04.500 --> 32:06.660
I should be able to get you
there within a foot or two.

32:06.684 --> 32:10.152
Ready? Turn left.

32:11.557 --> 32:14.008
Wait. Did you go
to your left or my left?

32:14.010 --> 32:17.177
- My left.
- Yeah. OK, turn right.

32:20.433 --> 32:23.567
Alright, I'm standing
in front of a big cabinet.

32:26.606 --> 32:28.906
Alright. Down. Your down.

32:28.908 --> 32:31.992
Zoe, down is down.

32:31.994 --> 32:33.894
Alright.

32:33.896 --> 32:35.996
It's locked. Hold on a sec.

32:40.286 --> 32:42.369
Mateo, this is your office?

32:42.371 --> 32:44.672
- Crap!
- Couldn't find it.

32:51.681 --> 32:54.548
You were a bad influence
in there.

32:54.550 --> 32:57.768
I am so sorry. Next time,
I will focus on my breathing

32:57.770 --> 33:00.020
or these beautiful paintings.

33:00.022 --> 33:03.807
- Sadly, they're only prints.
- Well, you know,

33:03.809 --> 33:06.694
there's nothing
like the real thing.

33:06.696 --> 33:10.230
That's so true.
Do you... own a real thing?

33:10.232 --> 33:12.265
My family has a small collection

33:12.267 --> 33:14.234
but they're mostly
just sketches.

33:14.236 --> 33:16.316
I always find the sketches
more interesting though.

33:16.340 --> 33:18.539
The raw, sudden expression
of an artist,

33:18.541 --> 33:20.541
it's... it's breathtaking.

33:20.543 --> 33:22.076
Exactly.

33:22.078 --> 33:24.461
And between you and me,
it's much more affordable.

33:24.463 --> 33:27.381
I mean we're talking hundreds
of thousands versus millions.

33:27.383 --> 33:29.333
I'm sorry,
what was your name again?

33:29.335 --> 33:31.502
Paloma.

33:31.504 --> 33:33.587
"Paloma." Pleasure.

33:33.589 --> 33:36.056
I heard you have
an indoor yoga studio;

33:36.058 --> 33:38.642
I would love to see it.
Sure. Anything for you.

33:38.644 --> 33:40.844
By the way,

33:40.846 --> 33:43.397
has anyone ever told you
you have beautiful form?

33:43.399 --> 33:45.232
No, actually.

33:45.234 --> 33:46.984
Do tell.

33:51.306 --> 33:53.273
Alright, Zoe. All clear.

33:53.275 --> 33:55.075
Did you hear that guy
macking on Angie?

33:55.077 --> 33:57.194
Didn't it just make you
wanna punch him in the Jimmy?

33:57.196 --> 34:00.447
Zoe, men don't punch
other men in the Jimmy!

34:00.449 --> 34:03.150
Forget it. Look,

34:03.152 --> 34:04.251
just give me a second.

34:08.040 --> 34:11.458
Um!

34:24.190 --> 34:27.141
Zoe, please tell me
you have Tex's passcode.

34:27.143 --> 34:29.893
Yeah. It's 0411,
his mother's birthday.

34:29.895 --> 34:32.612
Isn't that just so sweet?
Yeah, the sweetest.

34:35.534 --> 34:37.317
Got you.

34:39.288 --> 34:41.655
Well, I think
we were right about Mateo.

34:41.657 --> 34:43.791
He went full Casanova on me.

34:43.793 --> 34:45.793
He's not the only one.

34:45.795 --> 34:48.195
I found Tex's phone,

34:48.197 --> 34:50.214
and you'll never guess
who's on it.

34:50.216 --> 34:51.799
Candice Green?!

34:51.801 --> 34:54.717
I wonder what
that yoga position's called.

35:02.320 --> 35:04.537
OK. I'm running his name now.

35:04.539 --> 35:06.789
Walk me through what we know.

35:06.791 --> 35:09.775
Candice and Mark go
to Intimate Intentions

35:09.777 --> 35:11.961
for relation therapy, yoga,
blah blah blah.

35:11.963 --> 35:14.463
Mateo discovers
they have an original sketch

35:14.465 --> 35:16.949
ripe for the picking.
Mateo seduces Candice

35:16.951 --> 35:19.135
who secretly keeps going
to Intimate Intentions

35:19.137 --> 35:21.670
after Mark pulls out,
so to speak.

35:21.672 --> 35:24.123
Mateo steals the sketch.

35:26.260 --> 35:29.145
They catch me catch them,
and bam.

35:29.147 --> 35:31.814
Mateo chases Tex, sees him

35:31.816 --> 35:33.816
get hit, steals his phone.

35:33.818 --> 35:36.058
Now, Candice knows all this,
but she can't say anything

35:36.082 --> 35:37.653
or she'd have to admit
to the affair.

35:37.655 --> 35:40.272
So we just need Mateo
to lead us to the artwork.

35:40.274 --> 35:43.659
- Except...
- Except what?

35:43.661 --> 35:45.501
Mateo and Candice
are still sleeping together

35:45.525 --> 35:47.113
after the sketch
is stolen. That's when

35:47.115 --> 35:49.081
you took the photograph.
So what?

35:49.083 --> 35:52.368
So if a Lothario like that
pulls a scam like this,

35:52.370 --> 35:54.370
he'd be in the wind faster
than you can say

35:54.372 --> 35:56.922
"next wealthy socialite."
They're still sleeping together.

35:56.924 --> 35:58.924
That means Candice is in on it.

35:58.926 --> 36:01.260
Wow! You two are good.

36:01.262 --> 36:03.328
Is that Mateo's office?

36:03.330 --> 36:04.964
Yeah.

36:04.966 --> 36:06.966
Candice had the same
orange key tag in her purse.

36:06.968 --> 36:09.301
But what would they
both need a key for?

36:09.303 --> 36:12.521
A storage locker. Number 54.

36:14.442 --> 36:16.358
200 self-storage places
in the city.

36:16.360 --> 36:18.641
There's no way I could get
a warrant for every single one.

36:18.665 --> 36:20.863
So we need Candice
or Mateo to help us

36:20.865 --> 36:23.065
narrow that down.

36:23.067 --> 36:25.034
I'm beginning to know that look.

36:25.036 --> 36:27.036
You almost have
your memory back.

36:27.038 --> 36:28.654
That's right, so?

36:28.656 --> 36:30.873
So Candice and Mateo
don't know that.

36:36.998 --> 36:38.714
- Hey.
- Hi.

36:38.716 --> 36:40.499
- Thanks for meeting me.
- Of course.

36:40.501 --> 36:42.418
How are you?
I'm good. I'm working

36:42.420 --> 36:44.753
on the memories,
but not having much luck yet.

36:44.755 --> 36:47.706
That's good. Well, I mean
that you're working on it.

36:47.708 --> 36:50.009
And listen, don't even
think twice about the case.

36:50.011 --> 36:51.927
Consider it closed.

36:51.929 --> 36:54.847
Look, the Schiele sketch,
it's just a thing.

36:54.849 --> 36:56.899
But we'll pay you
in full of course.

36:56.901 --> 36:58.601
Listen...

36:58.603 --> 37:01.937
I think you're in grave danger.
What?!

37:01.939 --> 37:03.939
A few foggy memories
keep coming back to me,

37:03.941 --> 37:07.193
and I keep seeing this man
with curly dark hair.

37:07.195 --> 37:09.495
I think he's dangerous.

37:09.497 --> 37:12.998
And the number 54,
it keeps coming up.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.534
Does any of this
mean anything to you?

37:15.536 --> 37:18.504
No. I'm sorry, but I'll...

37:18.506 --> 37:20.372
I'll keep a look out.

37:20.374 --> 37:24.176
Listen, I'm running late
for a meeting. I've gotta go.

37:26.130 --> 37:27.963
You take care of yourself.

37:38.109 --> 37:40.526
- It worked.
- Great!

37:40.528 --> 37:42.945
Candice is on the move.
We need to stick with Mateo.

37:42.947 --> 37:46.065
- Let's hope we were right.
- You know, I've got a feeling

37:46.067 --> 37:48.467
we're gonna have the Greens'
sketch in our hand by nightfall.

37:48.491 --> 37:51.787
- A feeling?
- More of an observation. Look.

37:51.789 --> 37:55.991
Lady, start your engine.

38:06.420 --> 38:08.554
We have to sell it. Tonight.

38:08.556 --> 38:10.956
We can't. If we sell it
before the divorce

38:10.958 --> 38:12.975
goes through,
Mark gets half the money.

38:12.977 --> 38:15.261
- Half of your money, you mean.
- It'll all be ours

38:15.263 --> 38:17.263
once we're free to be together.

38:17.265 --> 38:19.181
We talked about this.

38:19.183 --> 38:21.183
Why don't I fence it?
Put the money

38:21.185 --> 38:23.519
in an overseas account?
With your name on it?

38:23.521 --> 38:25.521
What, you don't trust me?

38:25.523 --> 38:28.190
Come on, baby, please.

38:48.679 --> 38:50.095
Let's go.

38:52.967 --> 38:54.300
Hey.

38:54.302 --> 38:57.019
You found your Schiele.
You tricked me!

38:57.021 --> 38:59.521
Technically, you tried
to trick me first.

38:59.523 --> 39:02.107
- Mateo!
- Sorry, Candi. Nothing proves

39:02.109 --> 39:04.693
I was ever a part of this.
This isn't my first rodeo,

39:04.695 --> 39:06.729
sweetheart.
It's not ours either.

39:11.869 --> 39:14.870
He seduced me!
He stole the sketch!

39:14.872 --> 39:17.790
Never trust a man who tells you
everything you want to hear, Candi.

39:17.792 --> 39:20.626
Mateo Navarro?

39:20.628 --> 39:22.911
- I didn't do anything wrong.
- Not under that name.

39:22.913 --> 39:24.747
But under several others,
you're wanted

39:24.749 --> 39:27.750
for international art theft.
That's not true.

39:27.752 --> 39:29.635
Come with me,
we've got some art to discuss.

39:38.379 --> 39:40.346
So that's what
all the fuss has been about,

39:40.348 --> 39:43.766
Beautiful woman.
Isn't it always?

39:50.524 --> 39:52.441
Stefani!

39:52.443 --> 39:54.443
Hey. Yeah, I'm getting

39:54.445 --> 39:56.765
out of here in a minute. No,
there's no need to reschedule.

39:56.789 --> 39:58.864
So, we should go celebrate.

39:58.866 --> 40:01.500
I, think Shade's busy.

40:01.502 --> 40:03.502
Good. He's not invited.

40:03.504 --> 40:05.371
That's terrible.
He's my partner.

40:05.373 --> 40:07.623
Well, maybe I'm not
the nice guy you think I am.

40:09.260 --> 40:11.343
Really?

40:11.345 --> 40:14.129
Wanna find out?

40:15.966 --> 40:18.517
Yeah, right away. Yeah.

40:25.509 --> 40:27.960
Everything used to be
about goals, winning.

40:27.962 --> 40:30.796
Now, it's about
winning for other people:

40:30.798 --> 40:33.849
Jules, my dad, clients.

40:33.851 --> 40:36.018
- Angie?
- Yeah.

40:38.889 --> 40:40.889
Yeah, I'm good.
Just too much AC.

40:44.111 --> 40:47.446
You are so insanely
down to earth.

40:47.448 --> 40:49.114
- Thank you.
- I could throw in

40:49.116 --> 40:51.450
a scandal or two if you think
it'd make a better episode.

40:51.452 --> 40:54.069
- OK, I'm intrigued.
- There was that one time

40:54.071 --> 40:56.204
in Albuquerque,
but that one goes to the grave.

41:09.753 --> 41:11.803
I'm... I'm sorry,

41:11.805 --> 41:15.057
I thought... Wow, that was
really professional.

41:15.059 --> 41:18.010
- No, that's...
- No, I...

41:18.012 --> 41:20.812
I get it, I get it.
But I am gonna go,

41:20.814 --> 41:23.598
and I will call you soon.

41:32.910 --> 41:36.078
A beautiful woman leans in
to kiss me, and...

41:36.080 --> 41:38.163
I didn't reciprocate.

41:38.165 --> 41:41.750
Yeah... real mystery
you got there.

41:41.752 --> 41:43.835
What's that supposed to mean?

41:43.837 --> 41:45.757
You can be ridiculous
sometimes, you know that?

41:45.781 --> 41:47.756
I can be ridiculous sometimes?

41:47.758 --> 41:50.625
Come on! I'm not an idiot.

41:50.627 --> 41:52.627
I know what I walked in on
the other night

41:52.629 --> 41:54.629
when I came back
from the soup competition.

41:54.631 --> 41:56.965
- Didn't walk in on anything.
- Really?

41:56.967 --> 41:58.550
Really!

41:58.552 --> 42:01.086
Everything with Angie is fine.

42:01.088 --> 42:03.138
Everything with work is fine.

42:03.140 --> 42:05.557
It's better than fine,
it's great!

42:24.945 --> 42:27.079
- Thank you.
- Welcome.

42:27.081 --> 42:29.081
What are we drinking to?

42:29.083 --> 42:32.084
To the life we choose.

42:32.086 --> 42:34.970
To a life we choose.

42:37.641 --> 42:40.559
Hey, the other thing in my list,

42:40.561 --> 42:42.728
"Brown Eyed Girl,"
I remembered what it meant.

42:42.730 --> 42:44.479
- Ooh, something case related?
- No, it was

42:44.481 --> 42:46.598
just my favourite song. Hahaha!

42:46.600 --> 42:49.985
I remember hearing it for the first time,
and I couldn't get it out of my head.

42:49.987 --> 42:54.656
The first time I saw you,
I felt exactly the same way.
