00:10.260 --> 00:12.011
{\an7}&gt;&gt; VALENTINE'S DAY

00:12.095 --> 00:13.304
{\an7}WAS A DRAMA FEST IN LAGUNA.

00:13.388 --> 00:14.389
{\an7}&gt;&gt; THESE ARE FOR YOU.

00:14.472 --> 00:16.015
{\an7}&gt;&gt; STEPHEN GAVE LAUREN FLOWERS.

{\an7}&gt;&gt; THANK YOU.

00:17.684 --> 00:18.810

00:18.893 --> 00:19.394
{\an7}OUT TO DINNER.

00:19.477 --> 00:19.853
{\an7}&gt;&gt; WHERE ARE WE GOING?

00:19.936 --> 00:20.812
{\an7}&gt;&gt; RUMARI'S.

00:20.895 --> 00:21.813
{\an7}&gt;&gt; VERY ROMANTIC.

00:21.896 --> 00:22.439
{\an7}&gt;&gt; IT WAS REALLY GOOD

00:22.522 --> 00:23.189
{\an7}TO SEE HIM.

00:23.273 --> 00:25.734
{\an7}&gt;&gt; ARE YOU MY VALENTINE?

00:25.817 --> 00:27.110
{\an7}&gt;&gt; BUT LITTLE DID HE KNOW,

00:27.193 --> 00:27.944
{\an7}I HAD BEEN HANGING OUT

00:28.027 --> 00:28.737
{\an7}WITH TALAN.

00:28.820 --> 00:29.320
{\an7}&gt;&gt; YOU THINK I CARE ABOUT YOU?

00:29.404 --> 00:31.322
{\an7}&gt;&gt; I GUESS HE WAS PRETTY MUCH

00:31.406 --> 00:32.073
{\an7}OVER TAYLOR.

00:32.156 --> 00:32.490
{\an7}&gt;&gt; OKAY, THEN GO BE

00:32.573 --> 00:33.950
{\an7}WITH A WHORE.

00:34.033 --> 00:34.951
{\an7}GO BE WITH KRISTIN.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.536
{\an7}&gt;&gt; MEANWHILE, JESSICA AND JASON

00:36.619 --> 00:37.620
{\an7}HAD A REALLY BAD BREAKUP.

00:37.704 --> 00:38.371
{\an7}&gt;&gt; THAT WAS LIKE,

00:38.455 --> 00:39.414
{\an7}THE WORST CONVERSATION

00:39.497 --> 00:40.331
{\an7}I'VE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE.

00:40.415 --> 00:41.624
{\an7}&gt;&gt; WE KNEW IT WOULDN'T BE LONG

00:41.708 --> 00:42.459
{\an7}BEFORE HE JUMPED INTO

00:42.542 --> 00:43.334

{\an7}JUST COULDN'T GET OVER HIM.

00:47.255 --> 00:48.298
{\an7}SO IT WAS THE PERFECT TIME

00:48.381 --> 00:49.466
{\an7}TO HEAD OUT OF TOWN

00:49.549 --> 00:50.633
