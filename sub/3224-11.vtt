WEBVTT

00:04.040 --> 00:06.407
- My name is Abaddon.
- Who is a Knight of Hell.

00:06.560 --> 00:08.562
- I am your king.
- About that...

00:10.280 --> 00:13.011
You lied to me. Again.

00:13.160 --> 00:13.968
I didn't have a choice.

00:15.360 --> 00:18.807
So, what? You decide to trick me
into being possessed

00:18.960 --> 00:21.122
by some psycho angel?

00:21.280 --> 00:25.365
I know who you really are.
Gadreel.

00:25.520 --> 00:27.363
I will join you
as second in command.

00:27.520 --> 00:29.363
Here's the first name
on your to-do list.

00:29.600 --> 00:31.204
No!

00:32.119 --> 00:34.248
I save Sam,
I leave here a free man.

00:34.400 --> 00:37.449
Take control, Sam!
Cast him out!

00:37.640 --> 00:38.766
He saved your life.

00:38.920 --> 00:42.083
The thought of somebody else
being hurt 'cause of me...

00:42.240 --> 00:43.480
I can't live with that.

00:43.640 --> 00:45.051
Kevin's blood is on my hands.

00:45.200 --> 00:47.851
I'll find Gadreel,
and I will end that son of a bitch.

00:48.000 --> 00:49.570
But I'll do it alone.

00:49.720 --> 00:52.166
Go. I'm not gonna stop you.

01:13.160 --> 01:14.446
He's coming!

01:17.200 --> 01:18.850
Stand your ground,
no matter what happens.

01:19.000 --> 01:20.331
The Knight must be protected.

02:22.480 --> 02:26.769
So... is that boudoir smile for me?

02:28.200 --> 02:29.565
At least buy me a drink first.

02:30.480 --> 02:33.643
- I said the next time I see you...
- Dead. Yes, rings a bell,

02:33.840 --> 02:36.286
but let's not dwell
on the past, shall we?

02:36.440 --> 02:38.647
This bar is a bust.

02:38.840 --> 02:41.207
That waitress is trouble
with a capital VD,

02:41.360 --> 02:44.011
and your prey, Gadreel,
has left the building.

02:45.160 --> 02:47.766
So it's time to move on
to more pressing matters,

02:47.920 --> 02:49.968
like destroying Abaddon.

02:50.120 --> 02:51.281
Yeah, good luck with that.

02:51.480 --> 02:53.767
The Knights of Hell
aren't exactly the dying kind.

02:53.920 --> 02:57.163
But there is something
that can kill a Knight.

02:57.360 --> 03:00.921
The weapon that the archangels
used to execute them:

03:01.080 --> 03:04.050
- the First Blade.
- Never heard of it.

03:04.240 --> 03:05.366
Can I kill you now?

03:05.520 --> 03:08.251
I've been chasing that blade
for decades.

03:09.120 --> 03:12.283
The closest I got to it was when
one of my droogs, Smitty,

03:12.440 --> 03:16.001
got wind of a protégé demon
of Abaddon's

03:16.160 --> 03:18.447
who claimed knowledge
of the blade.

03:18.600 --> 03:21.843
Sadly, before Smitty
could nab the guy,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.446
a Hunter by the name
of John Winchester

03:24.640 --> 03:26.290
nabbed the protégé.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.445
I'm here to see if there's anything

03:28.640 --> 03:30.802
in the John Winchester
Memorial Library

03:30.960 --> 03:33.645
that might lead us
to the First Blade.

03:33.800 --> 03:35.802
To killing Abaddon.

03:35.960 --> 03:38.850
You want to hunt?
With me?

03:39.000 --> 03:42.049
I do love a good buddy comedy.

03:59.320 --> 04:01.561
Oh, yeah. Here it is.

04:03.480 --> 04:06.450
Yeah, he picked up a protégé
who had bones with Abaddon,

04:06.640 --> 04:08.080
but that's about all it says
in here.

04:10.560 --> 04:12.200
What do those numbers
in the margins mean?

04:12.280 --> 04:15.124
- None of your business.
- You're gonna play hard to get?

04:15.280 --> 04:17.281
We have time for a montage?

04:20.200 --> 04:23.044
It's a code,
one of my dad's storage lockers.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.844
He may have put something
about the case there.

04:25.000 --> 04:27.731
And what does the "T"
next to the numbers mean?

04:27.880 --> 04:30.360
- Not a clue.
- Fine.

04:30.520 --> 04:32.887
Let's go find daddy's
man cave, then, shall we?

04:33.080 --> 04:35.401
And how do I know
this isn't a trap?

04:37.040 --> 04:39.327
You... don't.

04:39.480 --> 04:41.926
That's what makes it fun.

05:12.200 --> 05:13.690
Hey.

05:14.920 --> 05:17.810
Tastes like... molecules.

05:18.000 --> 05:20.241
What? What are you talking about?

05:21.520 --> 05:24.967
When I was human, you know,
I had to eat constantly.

05:25.120 --> 05:27.043
It was kind of annoying.

05:27.200 --> 05:29.089
Yeah, a lot of human things
are pretty annoying.

05:29.240 --> 05:32.403
But... I enjoyed the taste of food,

05:32.600 --> 05:36.082
particularly peanut butter
with grape jelly, not jam.

05:36.880 --> 05:38.769
Jam I found unsettling.

05:38.920 --> 05:42.083
So, what?
Now you can't taste PB and J?

05:42.240 --> 05:44.891
No, I... I taste every molecule.

05:46.080 --> 05:47.764
Not the sum
of its parts, huh?

05:50.080 --> 05:51.730
It's overwhelming.

05:51.880 --> 05:52.961
It's disgusting.

05:54.280 --> 05:56.408
I miss you, PB and J.

05:58.200 --> 05:59.964
We need to continue
your healing.

06:01.200 --> 06:03.123
We're almost done.

06:09.400 --> 06:10.811
What?

06:10.960 --> 06:13.042
- Nothing.
- You're a terrible liar.

06:13.200 --> 06:14.326
That is not true.

06:14.480 --> 06:17.165
I once deceived and betrayed
both you and your brother.

06:17.320 --> 06:20.210
Okay, that's not the point.
Cass, what's wrong?

06:21.640 --> 06:23.051
I noticed something.

06:23.200 --> 06:25.965
It's... It's resonating inside you.

06:26.120 --> 06:28.248
- What?
- Something angelic.

06:29.040 --> 06:30.804
Okay... what the hell does that mean?

06:30.960 --> 06:32.371
Maybe we should call Dean.

06:35.480 --> 06:38.086
No. He wanted to go, and he's gone.

06:39.400 --> 06:40.925
We'll handle this.

06:49.960 --> 06:51.405
Oh...

06:54.240 --> 06:55.571
ls all this really necessary?

06:55.720 --> 06:57.529
I mean, I've been
inside your brother.

06:57.680 --> 06:58.841
We're practically family.

07:00.840 --> 07:02.285
Listen to me.

07:02.480 --> 07:05.529
We are the furthest thing
from family.

07:06.800 --> 07:08.370
You got that, dickbag?

07:08.520 --> 07:09.681
Oh, yeah.

07:10.480 --> 07:12.323
Now, you want to hunt?
Let's hunt.

07:20.560 --> 07:22.210
I'll be right here.

07:26.040 --> 07:27.963
So what do you call
this decor, anyway?

07:28.120 --> 07:31.567
Rustic obsessive?
Paranoid deco?

07:35.400 --> 07:36.890
Here we go.

07:38.160 --> 07:40.367
Looks like my dad
was working with another hunter

07:40.560 --> 07:42.164
when he nabbed Abaddon's pet.

07:45.160 --> 07:47.527
I guess the "T" didn't stand
for terrible father.

07:47.680 --> 07:49.444
- It stood for...
- Tara.

07:50.360 --> 07:51.805
Doesn't ring a bell.

07:52.480 --> 07:55.563
All right, looks like
they interrogated the demon.

07:55.720 --> 07:57.848
Then they exorcised him.

07:58.880 --> 08:01.008
But not before he mentioned
the First Blade.

08:01.160 --> 08:02.730
I love it when I'm right.

08:02.880 --> 08:04.245
Yeah, well, the rest
of the file's empty, genius.

08:04.400 --> 08:08.405
What? Didn't they teach note-taking
at Hunters Hogwarts?

08:08.560 --> 08:10.562
Let's go see
if Tara's still kicking.

08:12.760 --> 08:15.809
I've found, well, something.

08:15.960 --> 08:19.851
It's a detail about when angels
leave their vessels.

08:20.000 --> 08:23.402
I think. It's... Enochean,
which can be a bit flowery.

08:23.600 --> 08:25.967
"And the departed shall remain,

08:26.120 --> 08:29.761
and the remains
shall be the departed."

08:29.920 --> 08:32.082
Okay, so, when an angel
leaves a vessel,

08:32.280 --> 08:33.840
they leave behind
a piece of themselves.

08:33.919 --> 08:36.764
Like, uh...
Like an angelic fingerprint.

08:36.919 --> 08:38.080
Whatever you want to call it,

08:38.159 --> 08:41.403
this piece of the departed
contains grace.

08:41.559 --> 08:43.562
Wait, you're saying there's
angelic grace inside of me?

08:43.720 --> 08:44.721
Yes.

08:45.760 --> 08:47.762
But it's fading each time I heal you.

08:47.960 --> 08:49.928
Okay.
Is that good or bad?

08:50.080 --> 08:52.811
Well, it's harmless.

08:52.960 --> 08:57.568
But the grace itself...
might be helpful.

08:59.680 --> 09:01.808
According to this,
we may be able to use the grace

09:01.960 --> 09:05.646
that remains inside you
to track Gadreel.

09:05.800 --> 09:08.565
- If we can extract it.
- How would we do that?

09:08.720 --> 09:11.200
Well... painfully.

09:12.960 --> 09:15.247
The Men of Letters
believed that you could perform

09:15.400 --> 09:17.801
a tracking spell
with extracted grace,

09:17.960 --> 09:20.804
but they were never able
to test the theory.

09:20.960 --> 09:24.601
Well, they didn't have
a guinea pig, but we do.

09:25.800 --> 09:28.326
You have a guinea pig? Where?

09:31.320 --> 09:34.085
Me, Cass.
I'm the guinea pig.

09:36.040 --> 09:37.565
Oh.

09:40.480 --> 09:42.130
Any idea where that is?

09:46.320 --> 09:49.927
- Tara?
- That's what the sign says.

09:51.960 --> 09:54.167
- Can I help you?
- Yeah. Hope so.

09:54.360 --> 09:55.850
John Winchester ring a bell?

09:56.920 --> 09:58.843
I'm his son.

09:59.000 --> 10:01.048
- You Sam or Dean?
- Dean.

10:05.200 --> 10:07.202
Well, didn't you grow up pretty.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.371
- Still in the family business?
- Yeah, born and raised.

10:11.520 --> 10:14.330
Listen, bunch of years back,
you worked a job with my dad.

10:14.480 --> 10:17.563
Well, me and my... associate...

10:17.760 --> 10:20.047
Ever since '92,
I get a painful little tickle

10:20.200 --> 10:22.726
in what's left of my knee
whenever a demon is around.

10:22.880 --> 10:25.724
Hunters. So trusting.

10:25.880 --> 10:27.803
I'll go grab a latte
while you get this sorted.

10:29.520 --> 10:32.171
Devil's trap under
the knock-off Persian, jackass.

10:37.360 --> 10:41.524
Tara, listen, my... associate...

10:41.680 --> 10:43.170
Friends. Besties, actually.

10:43.320 --> 10:44.731
- Not helping.
- Not caring.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.328
Look, I'm the King of Hell.
He's a Winchester.

10:49.480 --> 10:52.131
There's a reason why
we're working together.

10:52.280 --> 10:54.009
Yeah.
It's called possession.

10:59.480 --> 11:02.211
See? I'm good.

11:03.080 --> 11:04.081
Okay?

11:05.240 --> 11:08.210
Yes, you're right, he is a jackass,
but he's helping me on this.

11:08.360 --> 11:11.807
- Helping you with what?
- You and my old man found a demon

11:11.960 --> 11:13.564
who knew something
about the First Blade.

11:13.720 --> 11:15.131
We need to find that blade.

11:15.280 --> 11:17.203
Well, hell.

11:18.440 --> 11:20.329
You are as handsome as John.

11:21.720 --> 11:25.042
And as dumb, too, if you're
looking for that old relic.

11:26.280 --> 11:28.123
We're hunting a Knight of Hell.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.441
Why? They're all dead.

11:29.600 --> 11:32.080
One came back. Abaddon.

11:35.440 --> 11:37.204
The demon said
the archangels used a weapon

11:37.360 --> 11:38.805
that could kill
the Knights of Hell.

11:38.960 --> 11:43.284
We'd never heard of anything like
the Knights of Hell or a First Blade.

11:43.440 --> 11:46.808
Your dad thought he was lying,
trying to save himself.

11:46.960 --> 11:48.689
We took him out,

11:48.840 --> 11:50.683
and we had
a lovely weekend together.

11:55.880 --> 11:57.370
Then we went our separate ways.

11:57.520 --> 11:59.409
But I could never let the blade go.

11:59.560 --> 12:02.131
Something like that could really
give a Hunter an edge, you know?

12:03.640 --> 12:07.486
I looked all over the world,
destroyed my knee and my life.

12:07.640 --> 12:09.290
And all I found?

12:10.600 --> 12:14.321
A location spell for the blade,

12:14.480 --> 12:15.970
that I could never finish.

12:17.120 --> 12:19.282
Couldn't find one ingredient.

12:19.440 --> 12:22.091
- Essence of kraken.
- Kraken?

12:23.120 --> 12:25.441
I got a warehouse full
of kraken essence in Belize.

12:26.840 --> 12:29.411
Break the trap, I can be there and
back before you say, "presto."

12:29.600 --> 12:32.968
- Presto.
- I can help. Dean?

12:33.680 --> 12:35.682
He wants Abaddon as dead as I do.

12:39.680 --> 12:41.523
If your daddy could see you now.

12:55.200 --> 12:57.202
You know, even if that blade is real,

12:57.360 --> 12:59.681
it ain't worth being bosom
buddies with the King of Hell.

13:01.280 --> 13:04.170
Abaddon? Way worse.

13:04.320 --> 13:06.049
I'll deal with Crowley after.

13:06.200 --> 13:07.725
Trust me.

13:07.880 --> 13:09.689
You sound just like your dad...

13:11.040 --> 13:12.451
...when he said he'd call me.

13:18.760 --> 13:19.761
Shall we?

13:50.120 --> 13:52.122
Missouri. Figures.

13:53.440 --> 13:56.410
- Would you care to join us?
- Him? Anytime.

13:56.600 --> 13:57.965
You? Never.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.928
- Thank you.
- Good luck, Dean.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.406
You're gonna need it.

14:28.720 --> 14:30.882
- Wait.
- What?

14:31.040 --> 14:34.044
- I'm feeling something.
- Cramps?

14:34.200 --> 14:36.407
I feel something dark.

14:36.600 --> 14:38.045
What, darker than you?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.811
Oh, no.

14:45.080 --> 14:46.570
We need to leave here, now.

14:46.720 --> 14:48.484
What, are you allergic to bees?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.927
That's not a beekeeper.

14:51.080 --> 14:53.321
That's the father of murder.

14:55.160 --> 14:57.606
- Sorry. Who?
- It's Cain.

14:59.240 --> 15:00.401
As in Cain and Abel?

15:00.560 --> 15:04.406
Dean, we need to be a world away
from here. From him.

15:04.560 --> 15:06.403
You're not going anywhere.

15:08.040 --> 15:09.451
Crowley.

15:21.160 --> 15:23.322
Why don't you
just zap out of here?

15:24.840 --> 15:27.491
I'd never leave
my domestic partner in crime.

15:28.360 --> 15:31.045
Yeah, like your heart
grew three sizes.

15:32.320 --> 15:35.563
You can't zap out of here, can you?

15:35.720 --> 15:37.722
Cain's doing something to me.

15:41.520 --> 15:43.807
Well, it's not your day
for getaways, is it?

15:44.000 --> 15:45.684
All right, so,
tell me about this Cain.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.201
Well, after Cain killed Abel,
he became a demon.

15:49.920 --> 15:51.280
What do you mean "became a demon?"

15:51.360 --> 15:54.728
I mean, he became the deadliest demon
to walk the face of the earth.

15:54.880 --> 15:56.609
Killed thousands.

15:56.760 --> 15:58.888
The best at being the worst.

15:59.040 --> 16:00.804
And then he just...

16:01.920 --> 16:03.888
...disappeared.

16:04.600 --> 16:07.570
Everyone thought he was dead
or, at least, hoped he was.

16:09.040 --> 16:11.008
Do either of you keep bees?

16:12.480 --> 16:14.528
It's very relaxing.

16:15.600 --> 16:17.409
They're such noble creatures.

16:18.080 --> 16:21.402
And the honey?
Well, I keep it right on the comb.

16:22.040 --> 16:23.769
There you are.

16:27.160 --> 16:28.685
They're dying, you know.

16:29.560 --> 16:32.450
Without bees,
mankind will cease to exist.

16:34.000 --> 16:37.368
So, what are the King of Hell

16:37.520 --> 16:40.410
and a Winchester doing at my house?

16:41.400 --> 16:42.890
You know who we are?

16:43.040 --> 16:45.520
I'm retired. I'm not dead.

16:46.040 --> 16:49.089
What I don't know
is why you're looking for me.

16:49.240 --> 16:52.369
More importantly, how you found me.

16:53.800 --> 16:56.280
Ah, that's...
a funny story, really.

16:56.440 --> 16:59.284
Bit of a misunderstanding.
We really should...

16:59.480 --> 17:01.323
Shh...

17:04.359 --> 17:07.364
- You gotta teach me how to do that.
- Why are you here, Dean?

17:12.920 --> 17:14.922
We're looking for the weapon
the archangels used

17:15.079 --> 17:16.525
to kill the Knights of Hell.

17:17.560 --> 17:19.085
The First Blade.

17:20.280 --> 17:23.727
We need it to kill
a Knight of Hell. Abaddon.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.688
Look, I get it. You're retired.

17:33.280 --> 17:38.525
We're not here to get between
you and the demonic AARP,

17:38.680 --> 17:41.126
but it's bad out there, and I'm
just looking to even the odds.

17:41.280 --> 17:44.170
One last time,
how did you find me?

17:44.320 --> 17:45.606
We didn't.

17:46.280 --> 17:48.282
The location spell was for the blade.

17:48.960 --> 17:50.166
One-time deal.

17:52.480 --> 17:54.164
Anyone else know you're here?

17:55.480 --> 17:56.641
No.

18:05.440 --> 18:07.044
Excuse me, ma'am.

18:07.200 --> 18:10.010
Wonder if you might have seen
some of my friends pass through here.

18:11.520 --> 18:14.330
Big guy, kind of funny ears.

18:19.000 --> 18:21.810
Well, it's been a pleasure
having company,

18:21.960 --> 18:24.361
but once a century is enough for me.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.284
You can let yourselves out.

18:26.440 --> 18:27.805
Hey, listen, pal.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.968
We're not leaving here
without the blade.

18:30.120 --> 18:32.361
You have quite a reputation,
Dean.

18:32.520 --> 18:35.285
I see the part about you
being brave rings true.

18:35.440 --> 18:38.125
Well, what can I say?
I'm an all-in kind of guy.

18:38.960 --> 18:41.361
Abaddon is the last Knight of Hell,
and if you're out of the game,

18:41.520 --> 18:43.363
what the hell do you care
if she dies?

18:44.440 --> 18:45.771
If your friend here could talk,

18:45.920 --> 18:48.127
he would tell you that I trained
the Knights of Hell.

18:48.880 --> 18:51.724
I built that entire demonic
order with my own hands.

18:51.880 --> 18:53.041
Abaddon included.

18:54.920 --> 18:58.641
Well, that is information I could
have used five minutes ago!

18:59.960 --> 19:02.770
Well, here's something
your friend doesn't know,

19:02.920 --> 19:05.571
that no one knows, in fact,
outside of Abaddon.

19:06.480 --> 19:09.006
It wasn't the archangels
that slaughtered the Knights.

19:09.440 --> 19:11.090
It was me.

19:11.800 --> 19:13.609
Why did you turn on your own?

19:14.880 --> 19:17.201
Once again, I admire your bravery.

19:18.480 --> 19:21.484
But if you'll excuse me,
I have errands to run in town.

19:22.400 --> 19:24.448
Goodbye, Dean Winchester.

19:26.280 --> 19:28.123
Never return.

19:29.200 --> 19:32.443
Well, that was lovely.
Can we leave the country now?

19:32.600 --> 19:35.200
But you said the First Blade
was our only shot at killing Abaddon.

19:35.280 --> 19:36.770
This is the closest
you've been to it.

19:36.920 --> 19:38.160
We're not leaving.

19:39.440 --> 19:42.284
Will you listen to reason for once?

19:42.440 --> 19:45.205
He said he was going into town.
Awesome.

19:45.360 --> 19:48.170
We wait till he's gone, come back,
bust in, take what's ours.

19:48.320 --> 19:50.004
Got it?

19:51.280 --> 19:53.760
Sam, may I ask you a question?

19:53.960 --> 19:55.291
You just did.

19:55.440 --> 19:57.442
Can I ask you another question?

19:57.600 --> 20:00.171
Well, technically, you...
Yeah, go ahead. What's up?

20:00.320 --> 20:02.607
Sam, the trials.

20:03.920 --> 20:06.969
You chose not to go through with
them for a reason, didn't you?

20:07.120 --> 20:10.806
You chose to live rather than
to sacrifice yourself.

20:10.960 --> 20:13.850
You and Dean...
You chose each other.

20:14.000 --> 20:15.843
Yeah, I did. We did.

20:16.000 --> 20:18.970
And then...
Dean made a choice for me.

20:19.120 --> 20:21.441
- What Dean did...
- It doesn't matter what Dean did.

20:21.600 --> 20:23.204
Look, I could have put
a stop to all this, Cass.

20:23.360 --> 20:24.441
I could have closed
the gates of hell.

20:24.600 --> 20:27.001
- Sam...
- Dean's gone, okay?

20:27.200 --> 20:29.487
This is on me now,
and if I can find Gadreel...

20:30.720 --> 20:32.245
...I can fix this.

20:32.400 --> 20:37.167
Now, being a human
means settling your debts.

20:39.560 --> 20:41.528
Let's start balancing the books.

20:58.280 --> 21:02.444
This is, by far, the dumbest idea
you've ever had.

21:02.600 --> 21:04.170
Yeah, well, it's early.

21:07.000 --> 21:09.287
There's nothing here.
Shame. Let's go.

21:09.440 --> 21:12.205
Hey! Sack up and start looking, okay?
We don't have that much time.

21:43.480 --> 21:45.881
You'll never believe what the
Winchester and Crowley found.

21:46.160 --> 21:48.606
Send back-up.

21:48.760 --> 21:51.411
Send... everybody.

22:05.760 --> 22:08.206
Now comes the part
that will actually hurt.

22:09.920 --> 22:11.763
I'm gonna begin the extraction.

22:18.960 --> 22:21.440
- Is it working?
- Yeah.

22:22.640 --> 22:24.210
But?

22:24.640 --> 22:26.290
I need to push
the needle in deeper.

22:26.440 --> 22:29.091
We need more grace
in order to cast the spell.

22:29.920 --> 22:31.331
Okay.
Do it.

22:31.480 --> 22:35.405
- Sam, if I get too close to...
- Damn it, Cass! Just do it.

22:54.840 --> 22:56.205
What the hell was that?

22:56.360 --> 22:58.647
Your body is regressing to the
state it was in before Gadreel.

22:58.800 --> 23:00.723
Do we have enough grace
for the summoning spell?

23:00.880 --> 23:03.690
- Sam...
- Do we or not, Cass?

23:06.000 --> 23:07.809
No.

23:11.000 --> 23:12.525
Then keep going.

23:17.440 --> 23:19.841
Nothing. Not even porn.

23:20.040 --> 23:23.931
Think I figured out why he went off
the reservation so many years ago.

23:25.040 --> 23:26.929
Lovely. Little plain.
Who is she?

23:27.080 --> 23:29.447
Cain had a similar ring on.

23:30.640 --> 23:32.688
Father of murder got hitched.

23:32.800 --> 23:35.167
He's back. Come on.

23:39.400 --> 23:40.640
Go.

23:42.160 --> 23:43.650
That belongs to me.

23:44.480 --> 23:46.528
Sorry. Gorgeous, by the way.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.365
I don't suppose they're with you.

23:56.440 --> 23:57.441
No.

23:57.600 --> 23:59.364
I guess we can't wait any longer.

24:00.520 --> 24:03.603
Your friend, Tara, was very helpful!

24:03.760 --> 24:05.364
Got downright chatty...

24:05.520 --> 24:07.841
After I peeled all her skin off.

24:09.560 --> 24:11.528
We don't want any trouble, Cain.

24:11.720 --> 24:14.246
Just want the so-called king
and the Winchester.

24:14.400 --> 24:16.323
I got a new master to impress,

24:16.480 --> 24:19.723
and I'm betting bagging
those two will do just that.

24:20.760 --> 24:21.841
Master?

24:22.000 --> 24:23.809
Abaddon.

24:23.960 --> 24:25.883
This lot all need to die.

24:26.040 --> 24:28.008
- I count...
- Too many.

24:28.160 --> 24:30.447
The whammy you put on the doors
that keeps us in.

24:30.600 --> 24:32.409
Will it keep them out?

24:32.560 --> 24:34.688
For now.

24:34.840 --> 24:38.162
I'm gonna barricade the entrances.
Get ready for a fight.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.642
- Well, good luck with that.
- What?

24:43.000 --> 24:45.367
You exposed my home.
You exposed me.

24:45.520 --> 24:47.090
Well, boo-hoo.

24:47.240 --> 24:49.004
Brave, but impulsive.

24:49.160 --> 24:51.083
You truly have lived up
to your reputation.

24:51.240 --> 24:52.720
I can't say you've lived up to yours.

24:52.760 --> 24:54.762
What can I say? I'm retired.

24:56.080 --> 24:58.003
If you survive,
you're welcome to join me

24:58.160 --> 25:01.960
for the last meal I will eat in this
house before I disappear again.

25:03.040 --> 25:04.883
It's the least I can do.

25:08.840 --> 25:10.604
Sam? Sam!

25:11.920 --> 25:14.764
- Keep going.
- Why?

25:14.920 --> 25:18.606
We... We...
We have to find Gadreel.

25:18.760 --> 25:19.921
No.

25:20.760 --> 25:23.445
Why must the Winchesters
run toward death?

25:23.600 --> 25:26.809
No, don't. Don't. Don't stop.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.129
Sam, when I was human, I died,

25:30.280 --> 25:32.089
and that showed me
that life is precious,

25:32.240 --> 25:34.686
and it must be protected
at all costs, even a life as...

25:34.880 --> 25:37.281
...as pig-headed
as a Winchester's.

25:39.120 --> 25:41.441
My life's not worth any more
than anyone else's.

25:41.640 --> 25:44.371
Not yours or Dean's...

25:46.280 --> 25:47.805
...or Kevin's.

25:48.720 --> 25:50.210
Please.

25:50.400 --> 25:53.131
Please, help me
do one thing right.

25:54.320 --> 25:55.810
Keep going.

26:05.920 --> 26:07.649
All right, I got this.
You take the front.

26:14.000 --> 26:16.526
So this is your play?
Corn?

26:16.720 --> 26:18.563
What am I not getting here?

26:18.760 --> 26:20.683
I mean, it's not like
you're a coward.

26:20.840 --> 26:22.842
Since when does the great
Dean Winchester ask for help?

26:23.000 --> 26:25.606
Well, that doesn't sound like
the man I've read about

26:25.760 --> 26:27.569
on demon bathroom walls.

26:28.360 --> 26:30.044
Maybe you've lost a step.

26:30.200 --> 26:31.964
Let's find out.

26:39.520 --> 26:41.409
Don't mind me.

26:41.560 --> 26:43.210
Enjoy yourself.

27:02.880 --> 27:04.530
Doing great.

27:38.400 --> 27:39.845
Really?

27:41.200 --> 27:42.440
Isn't it past your bedtime?

27:47.440 --> 27:49.090
You're good.

27:50.240 --> 27:51.571
Ah!

27:54.800 --> 27:56.006
But I'm Crowley.

28:30.960 --> 28:32.803
What, was that some kind of a test?

28:33.800 --> 28:35.962
I felt connected to you
right from the beginning.

28:36.120 --> 28:38.521
Kindred spirits, if you will.

28:38.680 --> 28:40.125
You and I are very much alike.

28:40.320 --> 28:43.847
Right. Yeah, except
I didn't kill my brother.

28:44.000 --> 28:45.729
You saved yours.

28:46.280 --> 28:47.441
Why?

28:47.600 --> 28:49.568
Because you never give up
on family.

28:50.160 --> 28:51.161
Even

28:51.320 --> 28:53.322
Where's your brother now, then?

28:55.760 --> 28:57.760
I don't know what kind of game
you're playing here,

28:57.800 --> 28:59.404
and I don't really care.

28:59.560 --> 29:01.244
Just give me the damn blade.

29:03.480 --> 29:06.370
Sorry, Dean.
I have nothing to hand over.

29:07.840 --> 29:10.161
- What?
- I no longer have the blade.

29:11.640 --> 29:13.210
It's gone.

29:27.520 --> 29:28.931
Hold on.

29:29.120 --> 29:30.531
This may pinch.

29:34.240 --> 29:36.720
Cass, what the hell?

29:44.040 --> 29:47.123
Cass. What the hell was that?

29:47.280 --> 29:49.044
I've healed your wounds completely.

29:49.200 --> 29:50.645
And the grace?

29:50.800 --> 29:52.962
Well, whatever grace
was inside you is gone now.

29:53.120 --> 29:55.930
What's left of Gadreel is in here.

29:56.080 --> 29:58.970
We'll just have to try the spell
with what we have.

29:59.120 --> 30:00.360
Damn it.

30:00.520 --> 30:04.889
Sam, I want Gadreel
to pay as much as you do.

30:05.640 --> 30:08.120
But nothing is worth losing you.

30:09.400 --> 30:13.564
You know, being human, it
didn't just change my view of food.

30:14.560 --> 30:16.403
It changed my view of you.

30:17.880 --> 30:20.963
I mean, I can relate now
to how you feel.

30:21.120 --> 30:23.043
What are you talking about?

30:24.440 --> 30:27.523
The only person
who has screwed things up

30:27.720 --> 30:29.245
more consistently than you...

30:30.200 --> 30:31.406
...is me.

30:32.720 --> 30:36.327
And now I know
what that guilt feels like.

30:37.240 --> 30:38.401
And I know what it...

30:38.600 --> 30:41.524
I know what it means
to feel sorry, Sam.

30:42.880 --> 30:44.211
I am sorry.

30:46.720 --> 30:48.085
I know.

30:51.320 --> 30:52.890
You know, old me...

30:53.840 --> 30:56.366
...I would've have just kept going.

30:56.520 --> 30:59.444
I would've jammed that needle
in deeper until you died,

30:59.600 --> 31:02.809
because the ends
always justified the means.

31:05.080 --> 31:06.844
But what I went though...

31:08.600 --> 31:11.604
Well, that PB and J...

31:12.960 --> 31:15.964
...taught me that angels
can change, so...

31:18.720 --> 31:20.245
...who knows?

31:20.440 --> 31:22.408
Maybe Winchesters can, too.

31:33.960 --> 31:36.804
Gone? What do you mean, gone?

31:36.960 --> 31:38.325
How?

31:38.480 --> 31:41.484
The spell brought us here to you,
so it has to be here.

31:41.640 --> 31:44.644
Your spell brought you to
the source of the blade's power.

31:46.280 --> 31:47.566
Me.

31:49.920 --> 31:51.445
Really? Now?

31:51.600 --> 31:53.045
It's the bloody mark of Cain.

31:54.840 --> 31:56.604
From Lucifer himself.

31:57.600 --> 31:59.284
The mark and the blade
work together.

31:59.440 --> 32:01.602
Without the mark,
the blade is useless.

32:01.760 --> 32:03.683
It's just an old bone.

32:04.640 --> 32:07.769
- A bone?
- A jaw bone of an animal.

32:07.920 --> 32:10.571
The jawbone you used to kill Abel.

32:10.720 --> 32:12.210
Because he was God's favorite.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.840
Abel wasn't talking to God.

32:15.000 --> 32:16.525
He was talking to Lucifer.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.202
Lucifer was gonna
make my brother into his pet.

32:21.320 --> 32:23.129
I couldn't bear
to watch him be corrupted,

32:23.280 --> 32:25.248
so I offered a deal.

32:26.360 --> 32:28.806
Abel's soul in heaven
for my soul in hell.

32:30.400 --> 32:31.686
Lucifer accepted.

32:32.720 --> 32:35.041
As long as I was the one
who sent Abel to heaven.

32:36.520 --> 32:38.045
So I killed him.

32:38.840 --> 32:40.649
Became a soldier of Hell.

32:41.840 --> 32:43.126
A Knight.

32:44.320 --> 32:45.890
And Lucifer ordered you
to make more.

32:46.040 --> 32:49.408
My knights and I,
we did horrible things.

32:50.040 --> 32:51.451
For centuries.

32:52.120 --> 32:54.726
Bringers of chaos and darkness.

32:55.880 --> 32:57.166
Then you met Colette.

32:59.520 --> 33:02.569
She knew who I was...
and what I was.

33:03.320 --> 33:05.209
She loved me unconditionally.

33:06.560 --> 33:07.971
She forgave me.

33:08.720 --> 33:10.927
She only asked for one thing.

33:13.080 --> 33:14.491
To stop.

33:15.920 --> 33:18.287
When the Knights found out,
they took retribution.

33:19.080 --> 33:23.324
They took Colette, so I picked
the First Blade back up,

33:23.520 --> 33:25.761
and it felt so good to have it
in my hands again,

33:25.920 --> 33:27.888
and I slaughtered
the Knights of Hell.

33:28.040 --> 33:29.371
Not all of them.

33:31.080 --> 33:32.286
No.

33:40.680 --> 33:43.081
- Colette.
- My love.

33:47.760 --> 33:49.762
What have you done to my wife?

33:51.120 --> 33:52.201
Answer me, Abaddon!

33:52.320 --> 33:54.288
We can make this right,
can't we, Cain?

33:54.440 --> 33:57.603
Come back to us.
Come back to me.

33:57.800 --> 34:00.883
- I'm done.
- With the Knights or with me?

34:01.040 --> 34:02.963
- I'm done!
- Then so is she.

34:05.720 --> 34:06.801
No. Stop it!

34:06.960 --> 34:10.407
We could have been forever,
but you chose her.

34:10.560 --> 34:13.404
Well, if I can't have you,
then neither can she.

34:17.000 --> 34:19.480
Enjoying the view?
I know I am.

34:19.639 --> 34:20.687
Best seat in the house.

34:30.120 --> 34:31.804
Oh, God! No, Colette!

34:32.000 --> 34:33.650
Colette, I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

34:35.080 --> 34:37.128
I will find Abaddon,
and I will kill her.

34:37.280 --> 34:39.851
No, there's been enough killing.
Promise me.

34:40.000 --> 34:42.161
You're better than all of this.

34:51.639 --> 34:54.007
So I buried her, and I walked away.

34:56.080 --> 34:58.003
Well, I'm sorry. Truly.

34:59.120 --> 35:00.360
But I have to stop Abaddon.

35:01.520 --> 35:03.284
So where is the blade?

35:05.240 --> 35:06.924
No.

35:07.120 --> 35:09.282
Listen, you son of a bitch.

35:09.440 --> 35:11.283
You may be done killing,
but I'm not.

35:14.200 --> 35:15.884
You never give up
on anything, do you?

35:16.040 --> 35:17.371
Never.

35:20.440 --> 35:21.441
Well, I do.

35:23.200 --> 35:24.406
Cain?

35:25.480 --> 35:26.561
Cain?

35:31.160 --> 35:33.845
Well, I'll stay as long as I can.

35:34.000 --> 35:35.490
Aren't you a peach?

35:38.120 --> 35:39.645
I've tried.

35:41.040 --> 35:43.964
I've tried, Colette,
to see myself as you did.

35:46.280 --> 35:47.930
But I know who I am.

35:49.200 --> 35:50.725
And what I am.

35:53.240 --> 35:55.925
I know you watch over me still.

35:58.360 --> 36:00.567
But I need you to look away now.

36:12.000 --> 36:13.604
What the hell, man?

36:13.760 --> 36:15.603
You in or out?
I'm getting head spins.

36:15.760 --> 36:17.603
I can give you the mark, Dean,
if it's what you truly want.

36:17.760 --> 36:19.125
What are you talking about?

36:19.320 --> 36:21.448
The mark can be transferred
to someone who's worthy.

36:21.920 --> 36:24.685
- You mean a killer like you?
- Yes.

36:26.960 --> 36:28.803
- Can I use it to kill that bitch?
- Yes.

36:28.960 --> 36:31.770
But you have to know with the mark
comes a great burden.

36:31.920 --> 36:33.445
Some would call it a great cost.

36:33.600 --> 36:34.965
Yeah, well,
spare me the warning label.

36:35.120 --> 36:36.451
You had me at "kill the bitch."

36:36.600 --> 36:38.443
Good luck, Dean.

36:38.600 --> 36:41.001
- You're gonna need it.
- Yeah, I get that a lot.

36:41.160 --> 36:42.286
Let's dance.

36:57.120 --> 36:59.088
- Dean?
- I'm fine.

37:00.480 --> 37:02.960
All right, where the hell
did you stash the damn blade?

37:03.120 --> 37:04.645
Nothing can destroy the blade,

37:04.800 --> 37:06.290
so I threw it to the bottom
of the deepest ocean.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.171
It's the only way I could
keep my promise to Colette.

37:11.600 --> 37:14.331
You find the blade, kill Abaddon,

37:14.480 --> 37:16.244
but make me a promise first.

37:16.400 --> 37:19.404
When I call you,
and I will call,

37:19.560 --> 37:23.087
you come find me
and use the blade on me.

37:24.000 --> 37:26.685
- Why?
- For what I'm about to do.

37:41.840 --> 37:45.367
- They're all trapped in there.
- With him.

38:27.280 --> 38:28.725
Was that...

38:28.880 --> 38:30.041
Was that it?

38:31.240 --> 38:33.368
I'm afraid
there wasn't enough grace.

38:35.080 --> 38:38.209
We'll have to find Gadreel
another way. I'm sorry, Sam.

38:41.400 --> 38:42.890
It's all right, Cass.

38:44.240 --> 38:46.083
You, uh...

38:47.400 --> 38:48.640
You were right.

38:49.960 --> 38:51.769
You were right about everything.

38:59.760 --> 39:01.603
Now's the part
where you hug back.

39:01.800 --> 39:04.007
Oh. Right.

39:05.040 --> 39:06.849
- Sorry.
- Ah, there you go.

39:10.320 --> 39:12.049
As far as I'm concerned,

39:12.240 --> 39:15.130
Metatron is the key to fixing
everything that's wrong.

39:15.280 --> 39:16.691
I'm gonna find him.

39:26.800 --> 39:28.962
You know, Sam, we could use
all the help we could get

39:29.120 --> 39:31.441
to find Gadreel and Metatron.

39:33.440 --> 39:34.805
We got this.

39:50.240 --> 39:53.483
He was right, you know.
You are worthy.

39:54.200 --> 39:56.726
Great, now you're gonna
get all touchy-feely, too?

39:56.880 --> 40:01.408
Your problem, mate, is that nobody
hates you more than you do.

40:01.560 --> 40:03.722
Believe me, I've tried.

40:03.920 --> 40:05.331
So, how do we find this blade?

40:05.480 --> 40:08.324
You can't search the bottom
of the ocean, but I can.

40:08.480 --> 40:11.643
So, I'll find it and
bring it to its new owner.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.764
I saw you, Crowley.

40:23.000 --> 40:24.525
Back at Cain's.

40:27.440 --> 40:29.044
You dusted that undercard demon,

40:29.200 --> 40:33.524
and then you just sat back
and watched the main event.

40:34.200 --> 40:35.361
You knew.

40:35.520 --> 40:38.683
You knew about the mark.
You knew about Abaddon and Cain.

40:38.840 --> 40:40.490
You knew all of it.

40:40.640 --> 40:43.041
And you played me. Why?

40:43.200 --> 40:45.806
He would never
have given me the blade.

40:46.000 --> 40:48.367
Who can say no to you?

40:48.520 --> 40:49.885
I needed you to play along.

40:50.040 --> 40:53.044
You knew we were being followed,
and you didn't say anything.

40:54.080 --> 40:56.890
Well, Cain would want
to see his prize fighter up close.

40:57.680 --> 41:01.162
You plus demons equals fight night.

41:01.320 --> 41:02.810
Tara died.

41:04.200 --> 41:05.281
Thanks to you.

41:06.280 --> 41:08.726
Omelets. Broken eggs.
Et cetera.

41:12.560 --> 41:15.564
After I kill Abaddon, you're next!

41:15.720 --> 41:18.405
You don't mean that.
We're having too much fun.

41:19.320 --> 41:21.721
Listen up.
Even with the blade,

41:21.880 --> 41:24.565
we're gonna need all the help
we can get against Abaddon.

41:29.080 --> 41:30.764
Go find the blade.

41:32.680 --> 41:35.251
It's always something
with you boys, isn't it?
