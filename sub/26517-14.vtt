WEBVTT

00:01.087 --> 00:02.792
Previously on Crazy Ex-Girlfriend...

00:02.817 --> 00:05.483
I really like all this.

00:05.508 --> 00:07.128
You know, music and theater.

00:07.153 --> 00:09.136
I hadn't done it since this summer camp

00:09.161 --> 00:10.727
I went to, like, a million years ago,

00:10.752 --> 00:12.480
but I forgot how happy it made me.

00:12.505 --> 00:14.365
You loved that play.

00:14.390 --> 00:16.116
Love doesn't have to be a person.

00:16.464 --> 00:17.728
It can be a passion.

00:17.753 --> 00:19.993
When things get tough, it's
how I understand the world.

00:20.018 --> 00:23.486
Wow. Auditions for an
Elliot Ellison revue.

00:23.511 --> 00:25.010
"Please prepare 16 bars... "

00:25.035 --> 00:26.634
I just signed up to audition

00:26.659 --> 00:28.726
for a local community
theater production.

00:28.751 --> 00:30.017
I'm so excited.

00:30.168 --> 00:31.868
It feels really right.

00:34.522 --> 00:35.722
So, for my big, huge audition,

00:35.747 --> 00:37.714
which dress says, "I'm back, theater,

00:37.739 --> 00:38.971
and this time I'm staying"?

00:39.127 --> 00:41.461
That is a lot to ask from a garment.

00:41.529 --> 00:43.296
But... the black.

00:43.364 --> 00:44.497
- Okay!
- Definitely the black.

00:44.566 --> 00:46.566
- Okay.
- Okay. My turn.

00:46.634 --> 00:50.303
Yeah. Which suit for my interview

00:50.371 --> 00:52.738
says, "I am a kick-ass lawyer

00:52.763 --> 00:54.129
and I'm gonna work my butt off"?

00:54.441 --> 00:55.885
The navy. You know why?

00:55.910 --> 00:58.044
It brings out the sparkle
of justice in your eyes.

00:58.069 --> 00:59.889
That's a great compliment.

00:59.914 --> 01:01.214
Kind of want to date you now.

01:01.326 --> 01:03.793
And I would, but there's
so much competition.

01:03.818 --> 01:06.319
You and Greg and Nathaniel and Josh?

01:06.344 --> 01:08.408
No, I told you, that
is all off the table.

01:08.433 --> 01:09.699
They're out of the picture now.

01:09.724 --> 01:11.491
Clearing the path for my true love...

01:12.627 --> 01:13.614
the theater.

01:13.639 --> 01:15.438
These Elliot Ellison songs

01:15.463 --> 01:16.605
are so classic,

01:16.630 --> 01:17.807
and they've held such a special place

01:17.832 --> 01:19.866
in my heart since childhood.

01:19.934 --> 01:20.978
Paula, when I walk on that stage,

01:21.002 --> 01:22.168
it's all gonna click for me.

01:22.193 --> 01:23.356
I j... I feel it.

01:23.905 --> 01:25.171
That's great, Cookie.

01:25.573 --> 01:26.684
All right. Well, I got to go.

01:26.708 --> 01:28.385
Oh, by the way, how's
Darryl taking the fact

01:28.409 --> 01:30.009
that you're interviewing at other firms?

01:30.122 --> 01:31.254
Oh, not well.

01:31.279 --> 01:32.912
Not well at all. No, he's a mess.

01:33.278 --> 01:34.324
But you know what?

01:34.349 --> 01:35.982
He's gonna be okay. He's gonna be fine.

01:36.050 --> 01:38.885
Now watch my lawyer walk. Uh...

01:38.997 --> 01:41.431
Ooh, yes, girl.

01:41.456 --> 01:42.833
I kind of want to date you, too, now.

01:42.900 --> 01:44.200
- Yeah, you do.
- Hey, Paula.

01:44.225 --> 01:46.259
- Hey, girl.
- Hey, Rebecca, what's the emergency?

01:46.258 --> 01:47.536
Yes, so which dress for my audition?

01:47.629 --> 01:48.861
That's it?

01:48.886 --> 01:50.030
You couldn't have sent a text?

01:50.098 --> 01:51.664
No, you have to see it in person, okay?

01:51.689 --> 01:54.244
This is important. It's
my big, big, big day.

01:54.578 --> 01:56.876
- Wear the black.
- Okay. Thank you.

01:56.901 --> 01:59.193
Hey... last call to audition with me.

01:59.218 --> 02:02.152
I have no interest at
all. Also, I have to go.

02:02.177 --> 02:04.096
Beth said she needs to see me right now.

02:04.121 --> 02:05.588
It's very important.

02:05.613 --> 02:07.079
Also, she just had a coffee

02:07.104 --> 02:08.036
with my mom.

02:08.061 --> 02:09.936
So we all know what that means.

02:11.051 --> 02:12.463
She's gonna propose before
we go back to New York.

02:12.487 --> 02:13.765
I know it!

02:13.932 --> 02:16.503
Oh, wow, oh, my God!

02:16.528 --> 02:18.269
So I got to go. I
only have a few minutes

02:18.293 --> 02:20.226
to get a Mani, pedi, oxygen facial,

02:20.251 --> 02:22.766
and a quick zap at the
cryogenic chamber. Ooh!

02:22.791 --> 02:23.723
Bye, good luck.

02:23.761 --> 02:26.662
Should I go to the cold chamber?

02:26.793 --> 02:29.735
Nah. I don't want to
ruin my vocal cords.

My dad was the worst businessman.

03:13.290 --> 03:15.560
Everything's a mess.
Look at these invoices.

03:15.866 --> 03:18.934
"Stuff," "crap," "things," "junk."

03:19.153 --> 03:20.086
That's exactly how they teach you

03:20.111 --> 03:21.244
to do it in business school.

03:21.299 --> 03:23.232
Oh, I love these old-school booths.

03:23.257 --> 03:24.501
Are you reupholstering the leather?

03:24.626 --> 03:26.892
Dude, this is just a
pop-up for my senior thesis.

03:26.917 --> 03:28.028
I don't need to go full-out.

03:28.140 --> 03:29.706
Vinyl could get me the "A."

03:29.731 --> 03:31.518
Hmm. Yeah, I don't know.

03:31.543 --> 03:32.909
When I'm having a nice lasagna,

03:32.934 --> 03:35.134
I don't want my thighs
sticking to a synthetic.

03:35.247 --> 03:37.714
Okay, for that problem I'm
just gonna recommend pants.

03:37.739 --> 03:38.772
You would.

03:38.819 --> 03:40.351
Wait, and why are you
doing your thesis here

03:40.375 --> 03:41.407
and not in Atlanta?

03:41.520 --> 03:42.819
Access to a free restaurant.

03:42.844 --> 03:45.011
And my professor's a sucker
for family businesses.

03:45.459 --> 03:46.689
Those are the reasons.

03:46.757 --> 03:48.057
Yeah, no, don't buy it.

03:48.082 --> 03:49.426
You're doing it to be near Rebecca.

03:49.450 --> 03:50.549
What? No.

03:50.574 --> 03:51.974
No, no, no. You're insane.

03:52.086 --> 03:55.021
Oh. Okay. Uh-huh.

03:55.328 --> 03:56.499
I think we have a real shot

03:56.524 --> 03:58.457
of getting your charges
reduced to manslaughter,

03:58.482 --> 04:01.016
- shave off ten years.
- That's great. Thank you.

04:01.129 --> 04:03.396
Now, tell me why you're really here.

04:05.209 --> 04:06.618
What do you mean?

04:06.734 --> 04:07.945
You're telling me you're here for me

04:07.969 --> 04:08.979
and not because you want something

04:09.003 --> 04:10.403
to talk about with Rebecca?

04:10.428 --> 04:11.870
What?

04:12.491 --> 04:13.890
We're over.

04:14.307 --> 04:15.818
I mean, yeah, I might've cracked a smile

04:15.843 --> 04:17.588
when I found out that
she broke up with Greg,

04:17.612 --> 04:19.612
but I'm not pursuing her. No way.

04:19.680 --> 04:22.159
She's turned me down so many times.

04:22.184 --> 04:23.683
Yeah, what a weirdo.

04:23.751 --> 04:26.503
Why would a 7.5 turn down a 9.6?

04:27.404 --> 04:29.088
I took .4 off because your breath

04:29.113 --> 04:30.312
smells almost too good.

04:30.662 --> 04:33.303
Look, I know you care about our cases,

04:33.328 --> 04:35.428
but you also want excuses
to talk to your ex.

04:35.453 --> 04:38.708
What? No. No, no, no. You're insane.

04:38.733 --> 04:40.633
Your cases have nothing
to do with Rebecca.

04:40.702 --> 04:43.960
Oh, okay. Uh-huh.

04:43.985 --> 04:46.116
Hi, I was wondering,
um, a friend of mine

04:46.140 --> 04:48.040
is doing your community theater revue.

04:48.109 --> 04:49.475
It's got me thinking, um,

04:49.544 --> 04:51.310
you guys need anyone to work backstage?

04:51.422 --> 04:52.588
I'm a member of the community

04:52.613 --> 04:54.286
and really good at lifting stuff.

04:56.745 --> 04:58.687
Okay, great. Thanks.

05:01.622 --> 05:03.789
What?

05:05.493 --> 05:07.927
What? No. No, no, no, you're insane.

05:07.952 --> 05:10.439
This volunteer tech stuff has
nothing to do with Rebecca.

05:13.233 --> 05:15.930
_

05:21.909 --> 05:22.842
You okay?

05:22.954 --> 05:24.387
Yes. Totally refreshed,

05:24.412 --> 05:25.772
like I just stood in a metal barrel

05:25.813 --> 05:27.252
and got sprayed with freezing cold air.

05:28.182 --> 05:29.317
What's up?

05:29.342 --> 05:31.968
So... I have something to ask you,

05:31.993 --> 05:34.286
and... it's kind of a big deal.

05:34.355 --> 05:35.836
My answer is yes!

05:36.090 --> 05:37.423
I didn't ask you anything yet.

05:38.466 --> 05:39.410
Sorry.

05:40.128 --> 05:41.060
Go ahead.

05:41.173 --> 05:43.573
Hear me out. Because if we do this,

05:43.598 --> 05:44.808
people are gonna think we're nuts,

05:44.832 --> 05:46.032
that we're moving too quickly.

05:46.100 --> 05:47.344
Oh, I don't care what
other people think.

05:47.368 --> 05:49.142
Never do. I mean, I did for a long time,

05:49.167 --> 05:50.023
but now I don't. Go.

05:50.048 --> 05:51.213
- Here it is.
- Okay.

05:51.739 --> 05:52.671
Three little words.

05:53.795 --> 05:55.388
Jersey City condominium.

05:56.677 --> 05:59.078
I get it. You're thinking,
"Jersey City. No way."

05:59.417 --> 06:02.558
But it's up and coming,
and I found a place

06:02.583 --> 06:04.703
with a surprisingly cheap mortgage

06:04.728 --> 06:07.563
because it's right over an underpass.

06:07.631 --> 06:10.299
I had coffee with your
mom. She's excited.

06:10.367 --> 06:13.669
We have her blessing. She's co-signing!

06:14.290 --> 06:15.552
So what do you think?

06:15.577 --> 06:17.940
We have to apply as soon as we get back.

06:18.695 --> 06:20.084
Get back? Oh.

06:20.268 --> 06:22.889
I'm not going back
to New York next week.

06:22.929 --> 06:25.653
I didn't tell you. I'm doing a play.

06:25.706 --> 06:27.740
Here in West Covina.

06:27.853 --> 06:30.371
- A play?
- Yep, yep, yep, sorry,

06:30.396 --> 06:31.888
I committed already.

06:31.913 --> 06:35.414
Rebecca's doing it, too.
She proposed I join her.

06:35.483 --> 06:36.816
It's a three-night run.

06:36.884 --> 06:39.652
It's gonna be quite an engagement.

06:39.720 --> 06:41.322
I'm sorry, I have to go.

06:48.049 --> 06:50.649
Hey, so, uh, what made
you change your mind, huh?

06:50.674 --> 06:51.974
Was it something that Beth said?

06:51.999 --> 06:54.300
Uh, actually, it was
something she didn't say.

06:54.325 --> 06:56.045
I was expecting a ring
and I didn't get one,

06:56.070 --> 06:58.838
so now I'm not sure if I even
want to go back to New York.

06:59.423 --> 07:00.383
Oh.

07:01.127 --> 07:03.509
So, are you kind of having
a temper tantrum right now?

07:03.622 --> 07:04.554
No, I am not

07:04.579 --> 07:05.856
having a tantrum, I'm just doing

07:05.880 --> 07:07.189
a community theater musical revue

07:07.214 --> 07:08.591
so I don't have to
talk to my girlfriend!

07:08.660 --> 07:10.193
Okay, okay, well, that's okay.

07:10.218 --> 07:11.871
Well, I'm just happy to
have you here with me.

07:12.573 --> 07:15.441
This is it, Valencia.

07:15.853 --> 07:17.742
No. I'm home.

07:18.326 --> 07:20.426
This. This is where I'm meant to be.

07:20.451 --> 07:23.582
Hmm, you've never
actually done this before.

07:23.607 --> 07:26.098
Are you sure it'll be
everything you want it to be?

07:26.167 --> 07:27.444
Correction, I have done it before.

07:27.468 --> 07:29.068
In camp, in college, and in prison.

07:29.416 --> 07:30.913
But those times were different,

07:30.938 --> 07:33.749
because I was doing
it for fun... not now.

07:34.141 --> 07:36.281
- Now's real.
- Hmm.

07:36.638 --> 07:38.222
And whatever this turns out to be,

07:38.246 --> 07:39.889
I think it can make me happy.

07:40.948 --> 07:42.050
Truly happy.

07:43.150 --> 07:44.183
But what if it doesn't?

07:44.295 --> 07:46.295
And I'm telling you from experience,

07:46.320 --> 07:48.521
sometimes the thing or person you think

07:48.589 --> 07:50.895
will make you happy... doesn't.

07:55.202 --> 07:56.399

08:47.917 --> 08:49.146
Uh, Rebecca?

08:49.215 --> 08:50.681
There's a mentally disturbed man

08:50.706 --> 08:52.260
in poofy shorts with chicken legs

08:52.285 --> 08:54.252
walking towards us.

08:54.320 --> 08:55.987
Oh, dear. That's Tim from MountainTop.

08:56.099 --> 08:58.700
- Hi, Tim.
- Greetings, fair maidens.

08:58.725 --> 09:02.146
Be it that "hereforeto"
I am his royalty,

09:02.171 --> 09:03.171
the knightly prince.

09:03.240 --> 09:04.639
Wait, these are just the auditions.

09:04.664 --> 09:06.175
You already know you
have the prince song?

09:06.199 --> 09:07.832
No, no, no, no, no, no.

09:07.945 --> 09:09.811
But, uh... I'm gonna get it.

09:09.836 --> 09:12.079
I get all the best
parts at this theater.

09:13.667 --> 09:15.940
Ah! Here she comes.

09:15.965 --> 09:17.858
Here comes Connie, our director.

09:17.883 --> 09:19.716
She's the best. You're gonna love her.

09:19.811 --> 09:20.977
Hello, everyone.

09:21.387 --> 09:22.664
Hi, Connie.

09:22.920 --> 09:24.154
And welcome...

09:24.223 --> 09:26.623
to this...

09:26.648 --> 09:28.503
gorgeous temple

09:28.528 --> 09:31.162
we call... the theater.

09:31.217 --> 09:32.715
Join me, won't you?

09:32.740 --> 09:34.874
As we hop on our magic carpets

09:34.899 --> 09:38.301
and fly into the
glorious chasm that is...

09:38.960 --> 09:41.227
the Elliot Ellison songbook.

09:41.252 --> 09:42.985
He's won 14 Tonys,

09:43.010 --> 09:44.896
two Oscars, eight Emmys,

09:44.921 --> 09:46.254
eight Grammys,

09:46.279 --> 09:48.713
and one Kids' Choice award.

09:48.738 --> 09:51.105
The children know. They certainly do.

09:51.450 --> 09:53.083
Now, to be fair

09:53.152 --> 09:55.305
to everyone, I'd like you
all to sing the same song.

09:55.345 --> 09:56.514
It's the beloved

09:56.539 --> 09:59.881
Elliot Ellison classic
"Let Me Be in Your Show"

10:00.539 --> 10:02.038
from the seminal play

10:02.195 --> 10:04.128
Let Me Be in Your Show.

10:04.153 --> 10:05.544

10:46.441 --> 10:47.723
Thank you, everyone.

10:47.792 --> 10:49.658
Tim, once again,

10:49.683 --> 10:52.014
you are our bulwark.

10:52.039 --> 10:55.475
Our stalwart. Our Walmart.

10:55.891 --> 10:57.624
We can always depend on you.

10:57.891 --> 10:59.175
That's why

10:59.200 --> 11:02.010
the role of the prince goes to...

11:05.675 --> 11:07.876
I'm sorry. I-I was just tuning up.

11:07.901 --> 11:09.801
Sorry to interrupt.

11:09.826 --> 11:11.624
You! Halt!

11:12.868 --> 11:13.839
Approach.

11:13.907 --> 11:15.340
Hey.

11:15.453 --> 11:16.552
You, sir,

11:16.577 --> 11:17.742
must audition.

11:17.855 --> 11:19.121
What? No, no.

11:19.146 --> 11:21.024
I'm just here to drop off
some legal papers for her.

11:21.048 --> 11:22.714
No, no, but-but you must.

11:22.739 --> 11:24.383
- You must, you see.
- No, no, no, no, no.

11:24.451 --> 11:25.951
He does not want to audition.

11:26.019 --> 11:27.939
Believe me, I mean, he's
never even done theater.

11:27.988 --> 11:29.187
That's not entirely true.

11:29.256 --> 11:31.022
In high school, the theater director

11:31.047 --> 11:32.968
begged me, so in my sports off-season,

11:32.993 --> 11:34.593
I-I did a couple musicals.

11:34.705 --> 11:35.804
Wait, what?

11:35.829 --> 11:37.496
Really? Who did you play?

11:37.973 --> 11:39.708
You know, I don't really remember, um...

11:39.733 --> 11:42.603
I think I played Jesus a couple
times, if that's even possible.

11:42.628 --> 11:45.280
You played Jesus in
Jesus Christ Superstar

11:45.305 --> 11:46.738
and in Godspell?

11:47.726 --> 11:49.007
Guilty.

11:49.076 --> 11:51.176
Please, sing! Sing anything!

11:51.245 --> 11:52.377
Okay, um...

11:52.680 --> 11:54.805
♪ A, B, C, D, E, F, G, H, I... ♪

11:54.830 --> 11:56.051
It is done.

11:57.618 --> 11:59.985
You are our prince.

12:01.150 --> 12:02.854
What say you, sir?

12:02.923 --> 12:05.123
Oh, word of warning, you will have

12:05.148 --> 12:07.515
to completely put your life on hold

12:08.401 --> 12:09.805
and spend every waking hour

12:10.632 --> 12:12.067
with these people here.

12:16.018 --> 12:16.912
Okay.

12:16.937 --> 12:18.858
I mean, I-I think,
since we can all agree

12:18.883 --> 12:20.282
that I'm not the driving force here

12:20.307 --> 12:21.836
and that someone else is asking me

12:21.861 --> 12:24.161
to spend time here with all of you...

12:25.337 --> 12:27.905
- Sure.
- What? No.

12:27.981 --> 12:29.414
What? No.

12:29.483 --> 12:32.384
We... have... our prince.

12:32.495 --> 12:34.164
The rest of you,

12:34.454 --> 12:37.946
I will post your parts
backstage in 15 minutes.

12:38.959 --> 12:39.959
Glorious!

12:44.598 --> 12:45.931
This is my space.

12:45.999 --> 12:47.788
This is my time to shine.

12:48.391 --> 12:49.444
If I'm not getting the prince,

12:49.469 --> 12:51.102
then I'd better get something good.

12:51.756 --> 12:55.350
Wow, I am so, so happy
about Cybil's case.

12:55.375 --> 12:58.243
I can't believe you got her
a new trial. It's amazing.

12:58.474 --> 13:01.267
And I can't believe
you are doing a musical.

13:01.292 --> 13:02.758
Yeah, well, I need hobbies.

13:02.783 --> 13:05.028
I stopped shooting ducks 'cause
of the whole good person thing,

13:05.052 --> 13:06.706
so I got a lot of free time.

13:06.731 --> 13:08.397
It's time!

13:08.422 --> 13:11.527
I'm squealing! Why am I squealing?

13:11.552 --> 13:13.285
Before you examine the list,

13:13.738 --> 13:17.873
just know that I gave you
the song I felt best suited

13:17.898 --> 13:19.264
your skill as well

13:19.289 --> 13:20.588
as your essence.

13:20.928 --> 13:22.667
I'll see you all tomorrow

13:22.736 --> 13:25.038
for rehearsal at 7:15 sharp.

13:25.405 --> 13:29.140
Or 7:45, or whenever you get there.

13:29.165 --> 13:30.631
I'm bound to be late myself.

13:30.788 --> 13:32.154
So...

13:32.179 --> 13:33.778
see you soon!

13:38.274 --> 13:40.474
What is it? What is it? What did I get?

13:44.491 --> 13:47.492
A character song?

13:47.965 --> 13:50.839
An unnecessary, forgettable,

13:50.864 --> 13:53.342
cuttable character song?

13:53.367 --> 13:54.409
Oh, my God.

13:54.478 --> 13:58.213
I got a song called "I'm
the Bride of a Pirate King."

13:58.238 --> 14:00.405
I'm gonna be a bride!

14:00.430 --> 14:02.199
Who needs my size? It's sample.

14:06.940 --> 14:08.373
Okay.

14:11.829 --> 14:13.095
Oh, my God!

14:13.120 --> 14:14.886
I got "Etta Mae's Lament."

14:15.168 --> 14:17.232
Oh, my God, that's, like,
one of his most famous songs.

14:17.257 --> 14:19.412
It's a classic comedy song.
Uh, Ethel Merman sang it,

14:19.437 --> 14:21.236
and then Gwen Verdon
sang it in the revival,

14:21.261 --> 14:23.306
and then Bernadette Peters
sang it in the second revival,

14:23.330 --> 14:25.412
and then Michelle Obama sang it on Glee.

14:25.437 --> 14:27.265
- Oh...
- Wow, what an honor.

14:27.378 --> 14:29.144
- Well, what's it about?
- Oh, it's about

14:29.169 --> 14:31.503
a sad saloon girl in the Old West

14:31.528 --> 14:33.362
who just wants to find true love.

14:33.941 --> 14:35.807
- Sounds a little old-fashioned.
- No! No, no.

14:35.832 --> 14:38.432
It's great. It's just... It's a classic.

14:38.632 --> 14:42.691
I really can't believe I
got such a great song.

14:51.895 --> 14:53.335
How was it? How was your interview?

14:53.360 --> 14:54.959
Wait, don't tell me. It's too painful.

14:55.072 --> 14:56.405
If you liked it better there,

14:56.430 --> 14:59.030
I will lose it. Did you
like it better there?

14:59.099 --> 15:01.299
Get a hold of yourself. It
was just my first interview.

15:01.412 --> 15:02.778
- First? There'll be more?
- Yes.

15:02.803 --> 15:05.290
I was top of my class, I won awards,

15:05.315 --> 15:07.382
so, you know, a lot of firms

15:07.407 --> 15:09.327
reached out to me for jobs.

15:09.352 --> 15:12.120
But, Paula, you have a job
right here with us, forever.

15:12.622 --> 15:13.622
You could be a lawyer here.

15:13.647 --> 15:17.069
Everyone wants you. Bert,
Nathaniel, me most of all.

15:17.094 --> 15:19.361
Okay, look, I-I appreciate that,

15:19.386 --> 15:22.887
but I have to see what
the official offers are.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.090
Oh. Oh! I see what you want.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.870
You want an official offer from us, too.

15:29.942 --> 15:32.130
Well, that's how it works.

15:33.271 --> 15:34.810
Right, yeah, okay.

15:34.835 --> 15:36.901
I see the game you're playing.

15:36.926 --> 15:38.224
No, I'm-I'm not playing a game.

15:38.249 --> 15:39.681
No, I got it. Copy that.

15:39.714 --> 15:42.315
- That's just how it works, so...
- Okay.

15:42.376 --> 15:44.542
Right. Wink, wink. I get you.

15:44.611 --> 15:46.111
Official offer.

15:47.111 --> 15:48.457
So I was thinking

15:48.482 --> 15:50.281
for the soft opening we do

15:50.306 --> 15:52.694
three appetizer and entree options.

15:52.719 --> 15:55.420
It's must more cost effective
than doing a full menu.

15:55.840 --> 15:56.798
Serrano!

15:56.823 --> 15:58.857
Chris, buddy!

15:58.969 --> 16:02.304
Look at you. Wait,
what are you doing here?

16:02.329 --> 16:04.769
Well, I was driving by and
saw some people in here,

16:04.794 --> 16:05.841
so I thought I'd stop in.

16:05.866 --> 16:08.633
- Wait, you drive?
- I know, it's disturbing.

16:08.702 --> 16:10.568
He was, like, ten years
old five seconds ago.

16:10.680 --> 16:14.015
So tall. Oh, God,
grown-ups are so weird.

16:14.040 --> 16:16.541
Constantly commenting, "Oh,
look at how tall you got."

16:16.610 --> 16:19.377
Yeah, I eat, I sleep,
this is what happens.

16:19.446 --> 16:21.846
Aw, I missed you, man.

16:22.186 --> 16:24.765
Look at this place. This looks cool.

16:24.790 --> 16:27.540
Yeah, getting it ready for a
soft opening in a couple weeks.

16:27.565 --> 16:29.531
Oh, yeah, I looked at the calendar.

16:29.556 --> 16:31.222
Turns out our opening is the same night

16:31.247 --> 16:34.382
as that super cool revue,
so we might have to miss it.

16:34.407 --> 16:35.904
I'm so sad.

16:35.929 --> 16:37.662
I hate musical theater.

16:37.731 --> 16:39.417
People are talking and then
they just start singing,

16:39.442 --> 16:41.676
and it's always just, like, what?

16:41.946 --> 16:42.878
Yeah, so,

16:42.903 --> 16:44.469
Serrano, talk to me about your menu.

16:44.538 --> 16:46.004
Ah, you might not like it.

16:46.072 --> 16:47.772
It's not like the Italian chains.

16:47.827 --> 16:50.919
It's authentic and homemade
and doesn't come with fries.

16:50.987 --> 16:52.587
Dude, I'll have you know,

16:52.612 --> 16:54.646
I'm the food critic
for the Daily Covina.

16:54.714 --> 16:56.559
All right, well, then
you could try the lasagna,

16:56.583 --> 16:57.837
but I got to warn you,

16:57.862 --> 17:00.028
we put actual tomatoes
in our tomato sauce.

17:00.069 --> 17:01.398
Are they Roma or San Marzano?

17:01.423 --> 17:03.265
- They're actually...
- Wait! Don't tell me.

17:03.788 --> 17:05.223
My taste buds will.

17:05.248 --> 17:06.887
Okay, come on.

17:06.913 --> 17:09.761
So, according to the Broadway
message board on Quimblepop,

17:09.786 --> 17:12.441
the first step to learning
a song for a musical

17:12.465 --> 17:14.520
is to memorize the
lyrics as a monologue.

17:14.545 --> 17:16.211
- Cool.
- It's so funny,

17:16.236 --> 17:18.114
I've been listening to
this song since I was a kid,

17:18.137 --> 17:19.882
but I've never really
studied the lyrics, you know?

17:20.040 --> 17:21.140
What a journey.

17:25.550 --> 17:26.320
Huh.

17:26.638 --> 17:28.279
- What's wrong?
- It's just,

17:28.348 --> 17:30.281
uh, the-the-the lyrics
are a little more,

17:30.306 --> 17:32.378
uh, retro than I remember.

17:32.619 --> 17:34.219
Oh. Is that a problem?

17:34.477 --> 17:36.521
No, no, no. It's not.

17:36.546 --> 17:38.567
I'm sure, once I rehearse
it, it'll make sense.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.276
Yeah.

17:40.301 --> 17:41.601
Yeah.

Hilarious!

19:14.170 --> 19:16.470
I thought it stunk.

19:16.495 --> 19:17.928
Okay, I get it.

19:17.953 --> 19:21.581
You're maybe not the
world's most flawless singer.

19:21.606 --> 19:23.639
I-I can hook you up with
lessons with Aunt Myrna.

19:23.664 --> 19:25.432
No, no, no, no, no.
It's-it's-it's not that.

19:25.457 --> 19:27.824
I mean, I know that I'm
not a great singer, but...

19:28.008 --> 19:30.609
All right, I know we shouldn't
hold these classic songs

19:30.634 --> 19:31.680
up to our modern standards,

19:31.705 --> 19:33.605
but, God,

19:33.630 --> 19:36.331
this whole song is just so problematic.

19:36.547 --> 19:39.882
You know? It plays right
into the Madonna-whore complex

19:39.907 --> 19:43.508
and manages to say that a
woman belongs in a kitchen.

19:43.533 --> 19:44.632
Huh.

19:45.408 --> 19:47.008
You know, in the musical this is from,

19:47.033 --> 19:48.313
Saloon Nights and Injun Fights...

19:48.338 --> 19:50.772
- It's not actually called that.
- No, yeah, it is.

19:50.797 --> 19:54.068
Anyway, the character who sings
this song is a successful madam,

19:54.093 --> 19:56.127
all right, so she's a
thriving businesswoman,

19:56.152 --> 19:58.366
but she says that she'd be
willing to give it all up

19:58.391 --> 20:00.091
to be walked down the aisle?

20:00.116 --> 20:02.722
I mean, what-what kind
of messaging is that?

20:02.747 --> 20:04.613
But beyond all of that...

20:04.986 --> 20:06.796
the song just...

20:07.481 --> 20:08.914
it's kind of dumb.

20:09.666 --> 20:11.628
What if these classic
musical theater songs

20:11.653 --> 20:13.487
that I've loved for so many years

20:13.512 --> 20:18.378
and kind of based my life on are... bad?

20:28.043 --> 20:30.939
Sir, your Chateau Lamontaine.

20:30.964 --> 20:32.230
Oh, the aught-one.

20:32.299 --> 20:33.579
It's not every day someone orders

20:33.634 --> 20:36.415
a bottle of the Lamontaine.
We wanted to see who it was.

20:36.440 --> 20:37.579
It's me.

20:37.604 --> 20:40.514
Yes, I came in especially.
I'm not even working today.

20:40.539 --> 20:42.606
- And what are you celebrating?
- Well,

20:42.631 --> 20:45.065
hopefully the hiring of someone
who already works for me.

20:45.090 --> 20:45.822
Hmm.

20:45.847 --> 20:47.079
- Oh! There she is.
- Oh.

20:47.104 --> 20:48.218
Hi.

20:51.127 --> 20:52.363
Whoa.

20:53.642 --> 20:55.265
- It's a Lamontaine.
- Mm-hmm.

20:55.290 --> 20:58.305
Wow. I-I always look at that
bottle on the menu and I wonder,

20:58.514 --> 21:00.547
"Who spends that much on wine?"

21:01.896 --> 21:03.273
But, seriously, we're
gonna need separate checks.

21:03.298 --> 21:05.332
Oh, don't be ridiculous. This is on me.

21:05.487 --> 21:06.787
All of it. The wine,

21:06.856 --> 21:09.528
the chevre, the tartare, the confit.

21:09.553 --> 21:10.852
Okay, Darryl, what's happening?

21:12.493 --> 21:13.871
This is happening.

21:15.682 --> 21:17.086
Is this my offer?

21:17.111 --> 21:19.411
I did the calligraphy myself, yes.

21:19.436 --> 21:22.422
Oh, I wanted it to be special and fancy.

21:22.447 --> 21:23.881
Those other firms...

21:23.906 --> 21:25.283
I'm sure that they've
got water fountains

21:25.307 --> 21:27.901
just spouting Lamontaine
all over the place.

21:29.139 --> 21:31.712
Um, well, okay. Thank you.

21:31.824 --> 21:35.192
Aw. And I will compare
it with the others

21:35.217 --> 21:36.493
that will come...

21:37.219 --> 21:38.452
via e-mail.

21:39.855 --> 21:41.989
Can we just have a
normal dinner now? Hmm.

21:42.057 --> 21:43.724
Maybe not.

21:44.196 --> 21:46.024
I got a whole porchetta.

21:47.378 --> 21:49.145
Too much?

21:49.254 --> 21:51.087
"I'm the local lady of the evening.

21:51.310 --> 21:52.676
"And though I like my men

21:52.701 --> 21:54.201
and my booze... "

21:54.270 --> 21:56.436
Right, Connie said "booze" was...

21:56.505 --> 21:58.005
the word to do the funniest.

21:58.073 --> 22:00.507
Okay, "and I like my men and my booze."

22:01.756 --> 22:03.987
"I pray to above... "

22:04.152 --> 22:06.152
"I pray to above...

22:06.419 --> 22:08.052
"that I'll find true love,

22:08.217 --> 22:10.884
but no one wants a lady who's used."

22:10.909 --> 22:12.275
Oh, God.

22:12.388 --> 22:14.087
"I'm nothing without a husband.

22:14.112 --> 22:16.312
"I'm nothing, I'm
nothing without a husband.

22:16.425 --> 22:17.969
I'm n... " Who's telling
her that, though?

22:17.993 --> 22:20.794
Is that her saying that's
she's nothing without a husband?

22:20.863 --> 22:21.845
Huh.

23:02.996 --> 23:05.706
"But I need mutual
respect when I walk down the aisle.

23:05.996 --> 23:08.697
This cowboy, can you
lasso me a husband?"

23:10.879 --> 23:13.287
"Though my lover count is over... "

23:13.693 --> 23:16.360
"I could be kiB"tcB"hen."

23:16.385 --> 23:19.853
Mm-hmm. Mm, mm, mm.

23:19.878 --> 23:21.311
Yeah. Okay, that works.

23:21.864 --> 23:22.933
Hey, guys.

23:22.958 --> 23:24.453
Guess what.

23:24.677 --> 23:26.443
- I have huge news.
- Did you talk to Beth?

23:26.695 --> 23:28.128
What? No.

23:28.241 --> 23:30.274
Okay, so I was going
over this song last night

23:30.299 --> 23:31.409
and I wasn't connecting with it

23:31.433 --> 23:33.367
and I was going over it
and over it and over it.

23:33.479 --> 23:34.812
Then I picked up a pencil

23:34.837 --> 23:37.404
and I started to make some notes.

23:37.473 --> 23:38.972
And then I...

23:39.041 --> 23:40.674
tweaked a few little lyrics.

23:40.743 --> 23:42.180
And I got to say...

23:43.078 --> 23:45.112
it's like night and
day, it's so much better.

23:45.180 --> 23:47.647
Wait, we're not allowed to
rewrite the lyrics, are we?

23:47.672 --> 23:49.417
I mean, not that I would
want to; mine's perfect.

23:49.442 --> 23:50.370
I'm playing a bride.

23:50.395 --> 23:52.596
Actually,
your song is also super problematic.

23:52.621 --> 23:53.857
We can talk about that later.

23:53.905 --> 23:56.803
But, no, I didn't really
rewrite anything, per Se,

23:56.828 --> 23:59.562
I just made... little adjustments.

23:59.587 --> 24:01.757
And, really, guys, it's so much better.

24:02.748 --> 24:05.442
- I think Connie's gonna dig it.
- Are you sure?

24:05.467 --> 24:07.801
- I mean, she's pretty by the book.
- No.

24:07.914 --> 24:10.147
When she sees these improvements I made,

24:10.182 --> 24:11.982
I really think she's gonna love it.

24:12.007 --> 24:13.320
I hate it!

24:14.797 --> 24:17.811
Who the hell do you think you are?

24:17.880 --> 24:21.515
Elliot Ellison redefined
musical theater,

24:21.540 --> 24:24.027
and-and... oh, oh, oh,

24:24.052 --> 24:26.762
you're gonna redefine a redefinement?

24:26.787 --> 24:29.375
Is that it?

24:31.416 --> 24:33.917
This damn trumpet won't stay in tune.

24:34.941 --> 24:37.218
Connie, listen, these are just

24:37.243 --> 24:39.643
little tweaks to make
it a little more modern.

24:39.668 --> 24:41.435
For instance, instead of singing,

24:41.503 --> 24:43.148
"But that don't lead to
walking down the aisle,"

24:43.216 --> 24:44.448
- Yeah?
- I only sing, "But I need

24:44.473 --> 24:46.306
mutual respect when I
walk down the aisle."

24:46.418 --> 24:47.480
It's just little tweaks.

24:47.505 --> 24:49.281
I entrust you...

24:49.306 --> 24:51.072
with the sacred words...

24:51.097 --> 24:53.780
of an American musical theater genius

24:53.805 --> 24:56.685
and you-you, oh,
y-you tweak them?!

24:57.423 --> 24:59.519
You will perform it...

24:59.588 --> 25:02.155
as it 'twas written.

25:02.692 --> 25:04.892

Everyone, opening night.

25:57.143 --> 25:58.776
Ten minutes until call.

25:58.801 --> 26:00.134
Have a good show.

26:00.625 --> 26:02.358
Hey, you doing okay?

26:02.383 --> 26:03.613
Eh.

26:03.638 --> 26:05.104
Following your dream much?

26:05.653 --> 26:07.017
Yeah.

26:07.042 --> 26:08.275
Yeah, I guess so.

26:08.730 --> 26:10.697
Hey, I was wondering if you had a minute

26:10.722 --> 26:13.681
to sign this old playbill.

26:14.209 --> 26:16.409
Oh, my God.

26:16.637 --> 26:18.304
This is the actual South Pacific program

26:18.329 --> 26:19.895
from Camp Canyon Grove? Look at that.

26:20.162 --> 26:23.633
- Where did you get this?
- I saved it this whole time.

26:24.768 --> 26:27.035
Okay, actually, I bought it on eBay.

26:27.060 --> 26:29.093
People sell, like, everything there.

26:29.436 --> 26:30.809
But I thought it'd be

26:30.834 --> 26:32.967
a nice thing for you to sign.

26:32.992 --> 26:34.850
Really?

26:36.151 --> 26:38.117
Okay.

26:38.142 --> 26:40.643
Oh, my God, this is so sweet.

26:43.154 --> 26:44.258
Thank you.

26:45.366 --> 26:47.866
You are really always there
when I need someone.

26:51.433 --> 26:53.466
- I guess I'll sign, like, right here?
- Awesome.

26:58.691 --> 26:59.957
Thanks.

27:04.244 --> 27:06.244
Oh.

27:06.269 --> 27:07.969
Hi, hey, there.

27:07.994 --> 27:09.832
- Hi.
- Hi, how are you?

27:09.857 --> 27:11.091
Um...

27:11.116 --> 27:12.494
Oh, what's happening?

27:12.518 --> 27:13.538
I just want to let you know

27:13.563 --> 27:16.062
that I did get another offer.

27:16.927 --> 27:18.088
Oh.

27:18.156 --> 27:19.623
Okay, I see.

27:19.735 --> 27:21.535
Well, thank you for letting me know.

27:21.560 --> 27:22.826
And...

27:22.903 --> 27:26.395
- was our offer competitive?
- Well... this...

27:26.907 --> 27:28.522
is their opening bid.

27:28.634 --> 27:30.100
Holy macaroni.

27:30.212 --> 27:34.114
- Wow, that is, um, some major scratch.
- Yeah.

27:34.139 --> 27:35.972
I know, I mean, money like that could...

27:35.997 --> 27:37.463
mean so much to my family.

27:37.488 --> 27:39.920
We could get out of debt,
could pay off the house.

27:39.945 --> 27:42.619
Tommy wants to go to college. College.

27:42.644 --> 27:46.574
I mean, our highest dream for him
was, you know, like a six-week course

27:46.599 --> 27:47.828
in welding, so...

27:47.853 --> 27:49.719
So, wait, so what are you saying?

27:49.832 --> 27:52.443
I don't know if I'm gonna work with...

27:52.468 --> 27:55.150
this exact firm, but
it turns out that...

27:56.862 --> 27:58.361
this is what I'm worth.

28:02.458 --> 28:03.844
Okay, um...

28:04.322 --> 28:06.543
- I'll see you in there.
- Yeah.

28:06.568 --> 28:08.238
- All right?
- Mm-hmm.

28:08.351 --> 28:10.727
Okay. It's good to see you.

28:10.752 --> 28:12.619
Thank you. Good to see you.

28:19.661 --> 28:22.462
to shimmy, shake, and smile, okay?

28:22.487 --> 28:24.399
I want to see both rows
of teeth. Top and bottom.

28:25.042 --> 28:26.400
Where's my tea?

28:26.853 --> 28:28.753
Well, where is it?!

28:31.477 --> 28:33.407
Check this out.

28:33.432 --> 28:36.387
This, like, totally suits me.

28:36.412 --> 28:39.179
Anyone seeing this won't
be oblivious anymore.

28:39.212 --> 28:41.159

if I were a pirate king,
I'd kidnap you, too.

30:37.361 --> 30:39.061
And would you marry me?

30:39.130 --> 30:41.263
Hmm. I mean, I'd be a pirate king,

30:41.288 --> 30:43.055
so I just would do what I want.

30:43.080 --> 30:44.280
You don't understand anything.

30:44.357 --> 30:45.768
You don't even understand
you're not supposed

30:45.793 --> 30:47.370
to come back here in
the middle of a show.

30:47.676 --> 30:50.696
You know, I think
something's going on with us.

30:50.721 --> 30:52.254
You're mad at me.

30:52.279 --> 30:54.913
I can tell from the
yelling and overt anger.

30:55.113 --> 30:57.261
Wow. Amazing.

30:57.286 --> 30:58.586
You're not only a pirate king...

30:58.724 --> 31:00.624
you're a genius.

31:05.012 --> 31:07.846
Oh, God, this next
song is a total bummer.

31:07.871 --> 31:10.138
It's one of the ones
that just lifts right out.

31:12.496 --> 31:14.386
Oh, hello there, folks.

31:14.455 --> 31:15.887
I didn't see you there.

31:15.956 --> 31:19.399

32:21.606 --> 32:23.232
Paula is my apple,

32:23.257 --> 32:24.817
and I need to try new fruit but I can't,

32:24.858 --> 32:27.684
because I'm afraid of
all the change at work.

32:27.709 --> 32:29.839
Nathaniel came in and Karen left,

32:29.864 --> 32:31.540
and then Bert came in and Jim left.

32:31.565 --> 32:33.298
And then he came back
and then Rebecca left.

32:33.323 --> 32:34.731
And through it all,

32:35.090 --> 32:38.224
Paula has been there, and
that's why I'm so upset.

32:38.405 --> 32:41.339
Y-You got all of that from "Apple Man"?

32:41.364 --> 32:42.897
Yes, of course.

32:43.159 --> 32:45.888
But you didn't get it from the
song, "Good Bosses and Friends

32:45.913 --> 32:48.446
Let Their Employees Soar
Elsewhere If Need Be"?

32:48.515 --> 32:50.751
No, I, I didn't connect with that one.

32:56.223 --> 32:58.382
Hey. You ready?

32:59.170 --> 33:00.945
I don't think I can sing this song.

33:01.961 --> 33:03.662
I hate my song.

33:03.774 --> 33:05.207
No, I hate everything about it.

33:05.232 --> 33:07.833
I-I hate, I hate what it's
about and what it says.

33:07.858 --> 33:09.792
Come on, it's just one
dumb song. Who cares?

33:09.903 --> 33:11.002
No, you don't understand.

33:11.027 --> 33:13.327
Loving these songs
is a part of who I am.

33:13.352 --> 33:14.985
I don't know, I just,

33:15.142 --> 33:17.868
I liked what I wrote, I
like the changes that I made.

33:18.720 --> 33:22.480
Then why not sing that version instead?

33:22.505 --> 33:25.001
I can't. You heard
Connie. She hated that.

33:26.039 --> 33:28.730
And I can't even
believe that I did that.

33:28.755 --> 33:30.388
I mean, God, I'm not
a writer-performer.

33:30.413 --> 33:32.455
I'm not Ike Barinholtz.

33:34.541 --> 33:36.875
Hey, Rebecca, you're on.

33:37.974 --> 33:39.741
I don't know, I just
wish that the audience

33:39.766 --> 33:41.077
could hear the lyrics that I wrote,

33:41.101 --> 33:43.435
but I, I can't go out
there and sing them.

33:43.503 --> 33:44.776
They should hear them.

33:46.019 --> 33:47.235
And they will.

33:51.533 --> 33:52.589
What?

33:55.159 --> 33:56.425
Hello, everybody,

33:56.450 --> 33:58.304
um, instead of singing the prince song,

33:58.329 --> 34:01.163
I'm actually gonna sing a
different song with a few

34:01.188 --> 34:04.241
small changes made by a, uh,

34:04.969 --> 34:06.049
a brilliant friend of mine.

34:28.649 --> 34:30.460
♪ It would be nice to
someday have a husband... ♪

34:30.484 --> 34:33.179
Close the curtain. Close the curtain.

34:35.866 --> 34:37.466
Connie, listen...

34:37.491 --> 34:38.920
- You're fired.
- What?

34:38.945 --> 34:40.375
Both of you, you're fired.

34:40.400 --> 34:42.000
Now get out of my theater at once.

34:51.458 --> 34:53.726
Well, big surprise, no one's coming.

34:53.751 --> 34:56.482
No one in this god-awful
town is coming here.

34:56.873 --> 34:58.197
Will you just hold on a second?

34:58.222 --> 34:59.855
We don't even open for five minutes.

35:01.826 --> 35:03.079
Table for two, please?

35:03.104 --> 35:05.404
Ah, we've got two.

35:05.429 --> 35:06.861
Two people. Big deal.

35:06.974 --> 35:10.075
Hi. Oh, you've got four.

35:10.440 --> 35:13.089
- Hi.
- Hi, welcome.

35:13.114 --> 35:15.581
Hi. Yeah, you can sit there.

35:15.650 --> 35:17.650
Um, Greg, there are,
like, eight people here.

35:17.718 --> 35:19.418
It's just like the old Serrano's.

35:19.443 --> 35:20.796
Uh, ten top. Incoming.

35:20.821 --> 35:23.989
Kitchen, start your engines,
these people are early.

35:24.102 --> 35:25.501
Why don't you guys sit right there?

35:25.526 --> 35:26.959
Man, I have missed this place.

35:27.028 --> 35:28.494
I cannot believe it.

35:28.562 --> 35:31.575
If this were a real opening,
we would've done huge numbers.

35:31.600 --> 35:32.359
Mm-hmm.

35:32.392 --> 35:34.999
It's like people
actually like this place.

35:35.024 --> 35:36.811
Dude, you don't get it. They always did.

35:36.836 --> 35:39.115
It's just, when your father
ran this place, he was a drunk

35:39.140 --> 35:42.274
and a terrible businessman
and he ran it into the ground.

35:42.299 --> 35:43.932
No, this place failed
because West Covina

35:43.957 --> 35:45.556
turned their back on this restaurant.

35:45.581 --> 35:47.981
That's one of the reasons
why I hated it here.

35:48.006 --> 35:50.559
Yeah, that's not true. You
just wanted to find reasons

35:50.584 --> 35:52.770
to hate it because you hated yourself.

35:54.062 --> 35:56.029
Trust me, I dated you. It was not cute.

35:56.467 --> 35:58.734
- Huh.
- I mean, the good news is,

35:58.759 --> 36:00.426
you used that hatred and,

36:00.451 --> 36:02.515
parenthetically, your horrible
relationship with Rebecca,

36:02.540 --> 36:04.974
to get out of town and
go to business school.

36:04.999 --> 36:07.800
So maybe now you're ready for this town.

36:08.901 --> 36:10.667
It's always been ready for you.

36:10.911 --> 36:12.183
Wow.

36:13.040 --> 36:15.178
I forgot how profound you are.

36:15.203 --> 36:17.721
That is always a big mistake.

36:35.894 --> 36:37.160
Huh.

36:48.863 --> 36:50.796
Still got it.

37:48.001 --> 37:49.635
If I'm being honest...

37:50.571 --> 37:52.571
I only did this to hang out with you.

37:54.208 --> 37:55.307
Oh, wow.

37:55.709 --> 37:57.670
Are you really surprised to hear that?

37:59.764 --> 38:01.113
Kind of?

38:01.894 --> 38:02.792
Nathaniel, what you just did

38:02.817 --> 38:05.114
meant a lot to me, really.

38:06.135 --> 38:07.148
It was thrilling

38:07.173 --> 38:10.560
to hear my words out loud,
even if it was a dumb idea.

38:11.237 --> 38:13.171
I don't think it was dumb.

38:15.464 --> 38:16.663
Really?

38:25.372 --> 38:27.973
Uh, we should, uh... yeah. I
should... no, I should get my stuff.

38:51.060 --> 38:52.592
Hey.

38:54.474 --> 38:57.303
You need to take one
of those great offers, Paula.

38:57.328 --> 38:59.128
- I know.
- It took one of the songs

38:59.153 --> 39:01.153
last night for me to realize that.

39:01.178 --> 39:03.157
Was it the one called "Money
Isn't Everything Unless It Gets

39:03.182 --> 39:05.667
Your Family Out Of Debt And
Sends Your Kid To College"?

39:05.692 --> 39:09.060
No, I-I didn't vibe with that one.

39:09.085 --> 39:11.252
I, I shouldn't have
tried to hold you here.

39:11.375 --> 39:13.420
Just because you mean so much to me.

39:13.445 --> 39:16.270
Ah, Darryl, come on.

39:17.321 --> 39:18.921
We are friends.

39:19.107 --> 39:22.409
Real friends, not "work friends."

39:22.434 --> 39:26.169
And we will be in each
other's lives forever.

39:27.308 --> 39:29.608
No matter where we get our paycheck.

39:30.368 --> 39:31.516
Really?

39:34.136 --> 39:35.427
Hell, yeah.

39:44.305 --> 39:45.705
Hey. Thank you for coming.

39:45.738 --> 39:46.557
Yeah.

39:47.535 --> 39:49.201
I have something to tell you.

39:49.599 --> 39:51.966
Okay.

39:52.114 --> 39:54.181
I want to get married.

39:54.797 --> 39:56.900
Everyone I grew up with is married.

39:56.925 --> 39:58.436
I've planned a billion
weddings for people

39:58.461 --> 40:00.661
who love each other a
lot less than you and I do

40:00.686 --> 40:02.286
and aren't as attractive as we are.

40:02.422 --> 40:04.007
I want this.

40:04.420 --> 40:05.853
I want you to propose, Beth.

40:06.502 --> 40:08.168
And if you don't,

40:08.575 --> 40:10.495
then I'm not going back
to New York with you.

40:20.282 --> 40:21.679
Hey.

40:22.073 --> 40:23.558
What are you doing here?

40:23.583 --> 40:25.389
Well, since I missed
your opening, I wanted

40:25.414 --> 40:29.192
to check the place
out, and... oh, my God.

40:29.323 --> 40:31.556
Greg, this looks amazing.

40:31.581 --> 40:33.214
Yeah. Thanks.

40:33.581 --> 40:34.791
I'm sorry I missed your theater thing.

40:34.816 --> 40:36.649
- How was it?
- Oh, it was terrible.

40:36.946 --> 40:39.859
Yeah, uh, yeah, I got yelled
at, I got called an idiot

40:39.884 --> 40:41.249
and then I got fired.

40:41.274 --> 40:43.474
Wow. That sucks.

40:43.499 --> 40:45.210
Yeah, I mean, there were some
good parts, there were actually

40:45.235 --> 40:50.519
some really good parts,
but mostly, I, uh,

40:50.829 --> 40:53.103
- I got my dreams stomped on.
- Oh.

40:53.387 --> 40:55.954
But enough about me. Look at you.

40:55.979 --> 40:58.779
Really. You look so happy,
you're, like, glowing.

40:58.804 --> 41:01.151
I feel pretty good, actually,

41:01.176 --> 41:03.810
and I-I decided, um,

41:04.186 --> 41:07.621
I'm gonna stay in town
and really open this place.

41:07.689 --> 41:09.122
Try to make it work.

41:09.147 --> 41:10.217
Wow.

41:10.242 --> 41:11.875
You're choosing to stay in West Covina?

41:11.917 --> 41:13.383
- By choice?
- Yes,

41:13.408 --> 41:15.168
and when I made that
decision, I had to ask myself,

41:15.193 --> 41:16.293
was it because of you

41:16.318 --> 41:17.584
or because of this place?

41:17.609 --> 41:20.176
Because of me? Why because of me?

41:20.740 --> 41:22.606
Because I still care about you.

41:23.403 --> 41:25.011
And maybe I did choose

41:25.036 --> 41:27.370
to do my thesis here to be
near you, but now I really,

41:27.395 --> 41:29.112
I, I love this restaurant.

41:29.878 --> 41:32.312
Good. Well, good, good.

41:32.337 --> 41:36.424
That is, that's good...
That's good. That's great.

41:36.449 --> 41:37.882
Wait, are you hungry?

41:37.907 --> 41:39.373
You got to try this lasagna.

41:39.398 --> 41:40.965
I was using Roma, but Chris was right,

41:40.990 --> 41:42.845
the San Marzano was
better, so I switched.

41:42.870 --> 41:44.303
Just, hold on.

41:44.583 --> 41:46.550
You're gonna love it.

41:47.022 --> 41:48.697
Oh.

41:50.788 --> 41:52.888
♪ Oh, can someone ♪

41:52.913 --> 41:56.214
♪ Lasso me a husband? ♪

42:01.701 --> 42:02.801
Damn it.
