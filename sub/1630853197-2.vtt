00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.487
You're a warrior

00:31.323 --> 00:33.033
"Lance or not."

00:39.122 --> 00:40.457
Sandpaper.

00:40.541 --> 00:41.542
Sandpaper.

00:42.709 --> 00:43.627
Wood glue.

00:43.710 --> 00:45.003
Wood glue, coming in hot.

00:46.713 --> 00:47.714
Paintbrush.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.886
I'll let you hang onto that.

00:57.850 --> 01:00.894
And finally, every work of artneeds a signature. And finally, every work of artneeds a signature.

01:04.022 --> 01:06.900
Well, what do you think?

01:07.901 --> 01:10.696
Good enough for the Lance-MakersCraft Fair today?

01:10.779 --> 01:12.155
Are you kidding?

01:12.239 --> 01:14.741
It's good enough to winthe Loveliest Lance award.

01:15.242 --> 01:17.536
Thanks, bud. I love it too.

01:17.619 --> 01:20.372
And I couldn't have done itwithout my amazing team.

01:22.207 --> 01:24.084
The glue on this still needs to dry,

01:24.168 --> 01:26.211
and I have to goto town square to help set up.

01:26.295 --> 01:28.172
Would you bring the lance to my booth?

01:28.255 --> 01:29.506
I'm on it.

01:29.590 --> 01:30.966
Warrior's word.

01:35.179 --> 01:36.471
Cool. See ya.

01:38.015 --> 01:40.392
Isn't Mom's new lance awesome, Pony?

01:40.475 --> 01:44.938
She looks so heroic with it.Like a knight from the days of old.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.858
Or like the warrior from my Herios box.

01:49.067 --> 01:52.779
It is I, Queen Kimya.

01:52.863 --> 01:56.533
Mother of Pinecone,defender of Sturdystone,

01:56.617 --> 02:00.037
teller of pretty good knock-knock jokes. teller of pretty good knock-knock jokes.

02:02.456 --> 02:06.835
Behold, my lance. Behold it if you dare.

02:07.419 --> 02:09.045
Whoa, whoa!

02:22.017 --> 02:24.728
That was a close one, Pony.Imagine if it--

02:32.152 --> 02:33.153
Broke.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.659
This is a disaster!

02:38.742 --> 02:42.037
What are we gonna do, Pony?Think, think, think.

02:46.250 --> 02:49.336
You wanna tell Mom?But she loves this lance.

02:49.419 --> 02:52.339
If she found out I broke it,she'd be so disappointed

02:52.422 --> 02:55.133
she might never let us helpin her workshop again.

02:56.134 --> 02:59.054
Exactly. Which is whywe've gotta fix it ourselves.

02:59.137 --> 03:00.848
Mom will never know this happened. Mom will never know this happened.

03:00.931 --> 03:04.017
And later, you and I will havea big laugh about it.

03:07.145 --> 03:08.564
Like that.

03:10.899 --> 03:11.900
Here's the plan.

03:11.984 --> 03:14.736
Step one, take the lanceto the repair shop.

03:14.820 --> 03:16.488
Step two, they fix it.

03:16.572 --> 03:20.158
Step three, Mom winsthe Loveliest Lance award,

03:20.242 --> 03:22.119
and everybody is happy forever.

03:22.202 --> 03:23.537
Sound good?

03:26.665 --> 03:27.791
Hide!

03:30.127 --> 03:34.381
Step four, do all of the abovewithout Mom seeing us.

03:34.923 --> 03:36.049
Follow my lead.

03:43.056 --> 03:44.057
Boom.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.977
Made it to the lance shoptotally undetected.

03:47.603 --> 03:48.937
Hi there.

03:49.021 --> 03:51.064
Whoops.I gotta stop doing that.

03:51.148 --> 03:57.487
I'm Lance, of Lance's Lances,the finest lances in all the lance.

03:57.988 --> 03:59.573
By which I mean "land."

03:59.656 --> 04:02.784
Care to take a chanceon a fancy lance? Care to take a chanceon a fancy lance?

04:02.868 --> 04:04.912
Actually, we need you to fix one.

04:05.954 --> 04:08.040
Well, then you've come to the right place.

04:08.123 --> 04:11.418
My motto is, "Every lance getsa second chance here at Lance's."

04:11.502 --> 04:12.711
Let's see what you got.

04:13.504 --> 04:17.216
Oh, no. Oh, no, no, no. This won't do.This is way too broken.

04:17.298 --> 04:21.053
I wish I could help you, but you'd haveto be a magician to fix this disaster.

04:22.971 --> 04:26.934
I don't know any magicians,but I do know a wizard.

04:28.268 --> 04:31.980
We all know wizards.No need to brag about it.

04:33.232 --> 04:36.610
Of course,I could use magic to fix your lance.

04:37.236 --> 04:41.240
In fact, the fixing spellis one of the easiest spells I know.

04:41.323 --> 04:44.743
This is great. We'll have Mom's lanceback to normal in no time.

04:45.536 --> 04:48.747
Indeed. In just a few short years.

04:49.665 --> 04:52.000
Years! I can't wait that long.

04:53.794 --> 04:56.296
Kids today… so impatient.

04:57.172 --> 05:00.551
It's just that I need itfor the Lance-Makers Fair this afternoon. It's just that I need itfor the Lance-Makers Fair this afternoon.

05:00.634 --> 05:05.305
Oh, sorry, but there's no such thingas a quick fix spell. Believe me.

05:05.931 --> 05:10.644
I tried it on a broken teapot once.So many spouts. No way to pour.

05:11.311 --> 05:12.312
Well…

05:13.772 --> 05:14.773
Thanks anyway.

05:15.524 --> 05:16.525
Or…

05:16.608 --> 05:17.776
Or? Or, or?

05:17.860 --> 05:23.073
Or I could cast a look-alike spell.

05:23.156 --> 05:24.992
Now, it wouldn't fix your lance,

05:25.075 --> 05:28.412
but it would make a lancethat looks just like it.

05:28.495 --> 05:30.831
I'd need a piece ofthe original lance, though.

05:30.914 --> 05:33.500
Sure, coming right up.

05:36.461 --> 05:37.462
What's wrong?

05:37.546 --> 05:40.299
Greymoon said it'll lookjust like Mom's lance.

05:40.382 --> 05:42.384
She'll never know the difference.

05:43.594 --> 05:48.432
Please, Pony. I gave my word.I really don't want to let her down.

05:54.396 --> 05:56.648
-We'll do it!-Great!

05:56.732 --> 05:59.943
Because I already started making itwhile you were talking.

06:00.694 --> 06:02.196
The feather of a phoenix.

06:04.406 --> 06:06.700
The petals of a Starflower.

06:08.785 --> 06:10.746
The howl of a hero.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.417
Good howl.

06:16.293 --> 06:18.712
And a piece of the objectthat you need copied.

06:24.092 --> 06:26.094
There's only one more ingredient,

06:26.178 --> 06:29.640
and it's the most difficultto retrieve of all.

06:32.851 --> 06:34.102
Water.

06:35.521 --> 06:38.190
Water? That's not hard to get.

06:38.273 --> 06:40.567
Easy for you to say. I've got a bad back.

06:42.194 --> 06:44.112
I need five buckets.

06:44.196 --> 06:47.574
Once you have it,I shall complete the spell.

06:47.658 --> 06:50.827
No problemo.We'll just hit up the town fountain.

06:52.287 --> 06:53.997
Which is in the middle of…

06:56.917 --> 07:00.295
The town square, aka Mom central. The town square, aka Mom central.

07:00.796 --> 07:02.381
We'll have to go right past her.

07:04.007 --> 07:05.467
But that is no problem

07:05.551 --> 07:08.887
for two of the stealthiest warriorsthe world has ever--

07:10.681 --> 07:15.352
No, Pony. Eyes on the prize.Eyes on the prize.

07:35.873 --> 07:37.833
Yes, perfect disguise.

07:38.333 --> 07:39.418
Pony.

07:43.547 --> 07:44.548
Pony.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.385
Pony!

07:50.762 --> 07:52.598
Pony.

07:56.351 --> 07:59.313
Four and five.

07:59.396 --> 08:01.064
You did it. You did it.

08:01.148 --> 08:02.149
Yay.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.403
And with some deliciousice cream residue.

08:07.029 --> 08:09.781
And now, to conjure your look-alike lance.

08:10.449 --> 08:13.702
Fire burn, cauldron bubble.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.831
Take this lance and make its double.

08:21.126 --> 08:23.128
Greymoon, you're a genius.

08:23.212 --> 08:26.340
Now Mom will never need to knowthat we broke her lance.

08:27.382 --> 08:30.802
Genius? Oh, well.Wayne the Magnificent did once say--

08:31.929 --> 08:33.347
And you're gone.

08:33.847 --> 08:39.477
All right, let's give it up for Garthorand his lance, Rhapsody in Glue.

08:41.230 --> 08:43.065
Hey, Mom.

08:43.148 --> 08:45.734
Hey, you made it.What happened to you two?

08:47.069 --> 08:48.320
We had to…

08:50.280 --> 08:54.034
go on an epic quest of epicness?

08:55.035 --> 08:56.662
Sounds epic.

08:59.081 --> 09:04.002
Our next presenter is a three-timeLoveliest Lance award winner. Our next presenter is a three-timeLoveliest Lance award winner.

09:04.086 --> 09:06.547
Give it up for Queen Kimya!

09:06.630 --> 09:10.801
You two wait here.When I cue you, bring up the lance.

09:11.927 --> 09:14.137
Yeah. Go, Mom!

09:15.681 --> 09:19.852
Hello, lance enthusiasts.

09:19.935 --> 09:22.521
Are you ready to lance?

09:23.814 --> 09:26.024
I've made many lances over the years,

09:26.108 --> 09:29.152
but this one holds a special placein my heart because it's the first one

09:29.236 --> 09:31.280
I've made with my daughter, Pinecone.

09:32.656 --> 09:35.742
When I look at it,I don't just see a lance.

09:36.410 --> 09:38.871
I see memories of making lanceswith my mom.

09:39.580 --> 09:42.958
And the memories I hope my daughterwill have of making lances with me.

09:44.626 --> 09:46.211
So without further ado,

09:46.295 --> 09:50.674
I'd like to invite Pinecone up hereto share our very special lance.

09:59.975 --> 10:01.101
Thanks, pal. Thanks, pal.

10:03.645 --> 10:04.855
Hey, everybody.

10:04.938 --> 10:10.110
I came here to bring my mom thiswhen I should have brought her this.

10:11.528 --> 10:13.488
First one was nicer.

10:14.907 --> 10:17.367
Hey, what happened?

10:17.451 --> 10:20.621
I was playing with it, and it broke.

10:21.121 --> 10:26.293
I tried so hard to make you a new one,but it's just not the same. I'm sorry.

10:27.127 --> 10:29.671
I know how muchyou loved that lance.

10:29.755 --> 10:33.383
I loved it because we made it together.But we can make more.

10:34.510 --> 10:35.511
Really?

10:35.594 --> 10:36.929
Of course, bud.

10:37.012 --> 10:40.516
I only wish you told me sooner becauseit looks like you've had a rough day.

10:41.975 --> 10:45.229
Our epic questwas more awful than epic.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.480
That's okay.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.440
Just, next time you have a problem,

10:48.524 --> 10:50.609
don't feel like you need tohide the truth.

10:50.692 --> 10:53.278
We're in this together. Warrior's word?

10:53.362 --> 10:54.696
Warrior's word.

10:57.157 --> 10:58.158
-Yeah.-Yes!

11:00.619 --> 11:07.543
I do not want to hide the truth either.I don't know what a lance is!

11:07.626 --> 11:10.963
My lance is just a bunch ofhot dogs taped together.

11:12.673 --> 11:14.800
My name isn't even Lance.

11:15.968 --> 11:17.386
It's Paul.

11:21.807 --> 11:25.435
You know what?I think our lance looks pretty cool.

11:27.229 --> 11:29.356
It's definitely one of a kind.

11:32.734 --> 11:34.778
"Treat your creature."

11:46.665 --> 11:48.000
Wakey, wakey!

11:49.960 --> 11:55.174
I made your favorite breakfast.Oat mush with some carroty flair.

11:57.217 --> 11:59.136
Yep, thought that might do the trick.

12:00.512 --> 12:02.514
Happy Treat Your Creature Day!

12:03.432 --> 12:07.978
And since Treat Your Creature Day isall about celebrating our animal friends,

12:08.061 --> 12:13.066
aka you, I've made a list of all ofour favorite things to do together.

12:15.485 --> 12:18.906
First, we're gonna go smellall the flowers in the meadow.

12:21.617 --> 12:25.871
Then we'll roll aroundin the biggest mud puddle we can find.

12:25.954 --> 12:28.540
Followed by a carrot extravaganza.

12:30.792 --> 12:34.880
And finally, we'll finish the daywith our very favorite activity,

12:36.006 --> 12:38.091
wishing on shooting stars.

12:44.389 --> 12:46.600
So, you ready to start your special day?

12:49.728 --> 12:51.188
Whoa, Pony.

12:56.068 --> 12:59.446
Look, Pony, everyone's outcelebrating with their creatures.

13:00.030 --> 13:01.448
There's Gladys and Dustin.

13:01.532 --> 13:05.577
Excellent work, Dustin!Put your coil into it!

13:06.370 --> 13:11.458
And look, Moss made his cow Sessiea very special dairy-free sorbet.

13:12.543 --> 13:14.962
Hey, Pinecone. Hey, Pony.

13:15.045 --> 13:16.547
Hey, Hawthorn.

13:16.630 --> 13:18.382
Happy Treat Your Creature Day.

13:18.465 --> 13:20.092
What are you and Blaise up to?

13:20.175 --> 13:22.511
We're starting offwith a game of hopscotch.

13:22.594 --> 13:25.389
Blaise is really good at hopping.It's a toad thing.

13:29.393 --> 13:31.019
Well, have a good one.

13:31.103 --> 13:35.107
We're on our way to the meadow for somesweet, sweet flower-smelling action.

13:35.190 --> 13:38.861
Have fun. I think Annabelle and Paragonjust came from there.

13:45.576 --> 13:47.452
So fancy.

13:48.328 --> 13:50.414
Is that your treat for Paragon?

13:50.497 --> 13:52.749
One of them. Check out my plans.

13:55.627 --> 13:57.129
Gourmet breakfast?

13:57.629 --> 14:01.508
Marble statue carving?Your own traveling band? Marble statue carving?Your own traveling band?

14:04.511 --> 14:07.848
That's some pretty fancy stuff.

14:07.931 --> 14:10.934
Well, Paragon and I havesome pretty fancy tastes.

14:11.018 --> 14:13.020
Besides,Treat Your Creature Day

14:13.103 --> 14:15.939
is all about makingyour animal friend feel special.

14:16.023 --> 14:19.693
It's not like we're gonna dothe same stuff we do on any other day.

14:20.944 --> 14:24.364
So, what special thingsdo you have planned for Pony?

14:27.534 --> 14:31.371
Too many to name,but they're all very special and fancy,

14:31.455 --> 14:33.415
just like me and Pony.

14:37.961 --> 14:40.047
Yeah, we'd better go.

14:40.130 --> 14:43.509
Lots of fancy stuff to do. See ya!

14:45.344 --> 14:47.471
Forget these boring old plans, Pony.

14:47.554 --> 14:50.307
I'm gonna make todayextra special for you.

14:53.185 --> 14:54.853
Isn't this so much better, Pony?

14:56.063 --> 14:58.982
Could we keep the movementto a minimum, please?

14:59.066 --> 15:01.902
Oops. Sorry about that, Garthor. Oops. Sorry about that, Garthor.

15:05.781 --> 15:07.991
We can sniff flowers any old day,

15:08.075 --> 15:10.369
but today we get to be a work of art.

15:16.083 --> 15:18.043
It's like looking in a mirror.

15:18.710 --> 15:20.754
It's nice to see a couple of art lovers

15:20.838 --> 15:23.215
out enjoying the day,just like me and Bootsie.

15:23.924 --> 15:26.844
We love painting. Don't we, boy?

15:26.927 --> 15:31.431
Breathtaking, just breathtaking.

15:36.854 --> 15:40.440
Now this is how you do mud. Hey, pal?

15:46.196 --> 15:48.699
We're gonna needsome more cucumber slices.

15:49.283 --> 15:51.285
Maybe just bring the whole cucumber.

15:52.035 --> 15:54.955
Yep. Who needs to roll aroundand play in the mud

15:55.038 --> 15:58.250
when you can just lie here doing nothing?

16:00.043 --> 16:01.295
What was that?

16:02.671 --> 16:04.673
Pony, we're not supposed to--

16:06.967 --> 16:08.343
You're going to get it.

16:10.095 --> 16:11.388
Take that, Pony!

16:14.183 --> 16:16.852
Hey, who got mud on my mud mask?

16:18.520 --> 16:20.230
Consider it my treat.

16:21.982 --> 16:24.484
Instead of the carrots we always eat,

16:24.568 --> 16:29.031
I decided to make youa fancy feast for the eyes.

16:31.450 --> 16:32.576
Isn't it pretty?

16:33.202 --> 16:34.912
So, what should we do next?

16:34.995 --> 16:37.956
Shop for jewel-encrusted saddles?

16:38.040 --> 16:42.002
Discuss modern literature?A third fancy thing I can't think of?

16:43.128 --> 16:44.213
Pony?

16:46.173 --> 16:47.424
What's wrong?

16:47.508 --> 16:51.345
We've been doing Treat Your Creature Daybigger and better than ever before.

16:52.513 --> 16:53.514
The sky?

16:55.349 --> 16:57.226
What are you--

17:01.438 --> 17:02.773
What?

17:04.733 --> 17:09.570
No big deal, just a paradefor my best friend. No big deal, everyone.

17:09.655 --> 17:11.656
There was no parade in your book.

17:11.740 --> 17:14.076
Well, not in the one you saw.

17:14.159 --> 17:16.954
It was in Perfect Plans for Paragonvolume two.

17:17.663 --> 17:18.872
It's a ten-volume set.

17:18.955 --> 17:23.794
Man, Annabelle really knowshow to treat her creature.

17:24.752 --> 17:28.382
I'll say.Reba and I just love a parade.

17:29.174 --> 17:34.388
Reba, they waved at us.What a day we're having. What a day.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.353
I'm sorry, pal.

17:41.436 --> 17:43.897
I thought I was making todayspecial for you,

17:43.981 --> 17:45.607
but now I know where I went wrong.

17:47.609 --> 17:52.281
I should have made todaysuper-duper, ultra, mega-special.

17:54.032 --> 17:59.663
I'm gonna throw you the biggest,fanciest party Sturdystone has ever seen!

18:03.917 --> 18:08.005
Hey there. How's it going?Nice to see ya. Thanks for coming.

18:11.633 --> 18:15.512
Hey, Mom, could I get an ETAon the float for Pony's big entrance?

18:15.596 --> 18:17.931
Yeah, just finished.With Hammer's help, of course.

18:18.640 --> 18:22.227
Awesome. And now to getan update on the music sitch.

18:22.311 --> 18:26.607
Hey, Pinecone, Blaise had a great ideafor Pony's entrance music.

18:26.690 --> 18:28.692
Take it away, sir.

18:32.696 --> 18:34.615
You two sound amazing.

18:34.698 --> 18:38.869
We love jamming together.Blaise is a creative genius.

18:42.080 --> 18:44.333
Don't be so modest.

18:44.416 --> 18:47.044
You really went all outfor Treat Your Creature Day.

18:47.127 --> 18:49.213
I didn't know Pony was into fancy parties.

18:50.047 --> 18:53.884
I mean, today is his special day and--

18:53.967 --> 18:57.054
and you can't get anymore special than this, right?

18:57.137 --> 18:59.890
I think it's time we got this partyofficially started.

19:02.559 --> 19:07.731
Hey, Greymoon, is the eagle in the nest?

19:07.814 --> 19:10.275
It sure is.

19:10.359 --> 19:13.570
Great. Hey, Gladys,could you call this party to order?

19:13.654 --> 19:14.655
Of course.

19:15.364 --> 19:17.950
Everyone make haste and gather.

19:18.033 --> 19:20.827
The time for fun is nigh.

19:22.621 --> 19:26.625
Welcome, Sturdystonians.This Treat Your Creature Day,

19:26.708 --> 19:31.213
I wanted to celebrate my pal, Pony,in the biggest way I could think of.

19:31.296 --> 19:33.048
Ta-da!

19:33.465 --> 19:35.092
How fancy.

19:35.175 --> 19:40.264
And now, put your hands, hooves, wings,and whatevers together

19:40.347 --> 19:42.391
for your guest of honor…

19:47.813 --> 19:49.356
Pony!

19:54.027 --> 19:55.153
Pony?

19:57.948 --> 20:01.535
Greymoon, I thought you saidthe eagle was in the nest? Greymoon, I thought you saidthe eagle was in the nest?

20:01.618 --> 20:04.705
Yes, the eagle atop the Jagged Mountains.

20:04.788 --> 20:09.835
He's always the-- I see.You meant, "Is Pony in position?"

20:11.503 --> 20:12.546
No, he's not.

20:14.464 --> 20:15.465
That's okay.

20:17.259 --> 20:20.762
He must have been so excited,he forgot to get inside.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.558
Please enjoy some Pony Brew,and I'll be right back.

20:25.309 --> 20:27.853
The eagle thing was confusing. Am I wrong?

20:29.771 --> 20:31.773
When was the last time you saw him?

20:33.066 --> 20:34.651
Well, it was only a few…

20:36.236 --> 20:37.404
…hours ago.

20:38.113 --> 20:43.785
I've been so busy organizing this party,I didn't even notice he wasn't there.

20:43.869 --> 20:46.788
I just wanted to make todayspecial for Pony,

20:46.872 --> 20:49.082
like Annabelle was doing for Paragon.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.919
But Annabelle and Paragonlike fancy stuff,

20:52.711 --> 20:56.048
and what's special for somepeople isn't special for everyone.

20:56.632 --> 20:58.091
Back me up here, Blaise.

21:10.854 --> 21:14.191
I think I've madea party-sized mistake, Hawthorn.

21:14.274 --> 21:15.817
We all make mistakes.

21:16.360 --> 21:20.113
I suggested to Blaise that we playleapfrog, and as a toad,

21:20.197 --> 21:22.199
he did not appreciate that.

21:23.283 --> 21:26.620
Besides,Treat Your Creature Day isn't over yet.

21:27.621 --> 21:29.957
I just wish I knew where he was.

21:42.970 --> 21:46.014
Pony, sorry I ruined your special day.

21:46.640 --> 21:49.226
I should have known the most special part

21:49.309 --> 21:51.478
was doing the thingsthat are special to us.

21:53.105 --> 21:56.066
Is there anything, anythingI can do to make it up to you?

22:01.113 --> 22:02.447
Right back at ya, pal.

22:07.411 --> 22:10.289
That's the best idea I've heard all day.

22:16.545 --> 22:19.965
Who needs all that fancy stuffwhen you've got this?

22:23.135 --> 22:27.431
Well, I guess some fancy stuffcan be nice from time to time.

22:29.850 --> 22:31.393
That was a nice one.

22:35.480 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
