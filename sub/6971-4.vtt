I have Westerley.

It's over.

00:06.424 --> 00:07.504
Goodbye, thief.

Goodbye, ship.

00:12.096 --> 00:13.711
Always and forever,

00:13.806 --> 00:16.047
Coren Jeers,
in the name of the RAC

00:16.142 --> 00:17.723
you are locked and served.

00:17.810 --> 00:19.846
(CHUCKLES) Well, damn.

00:19.937 --> 00:22.349
There's something wrong
with the rain.

00:22.440 --> 00:25.398
These showers
encode a false memory.

00:25.484 --> 00:27.770
It’s, like,
literal brainwashing.

00:27.862 --> 00:30.228
I'll ask my husband, but...

00:30.364 --> 00:32.480
I'm pretty sure
he'll say I'm busy.

00:32.617 --> 00:33.697
Ask me what?

00:33.784 --> 00:35.240
So, where do we set our bait?

00:35.536 --> 00:37.037
Somewhere they can't escape.

Bolt Ecker.
Sentence, ten years.

00:45.546 --> 00:46.922
Crime, smuggling.

00:47.006 --> 00:49.793
This makes no sense.
The Lady's got a giant armada

00:49.884 --> 00:51.545
and a brainwashed moon
to lock us up on.

00:51.636 --> 00:53.297
So why is she sending us
to a supermax prison?

00:53.387 --> 00:55.924
l have no idea,
but if this is where
the bitch wants us

00:56.015 --> 00:57.551
we gotta get
the hells out of here.

01:06.150 --> 01:08.232
Oh, the blitz dog play?

01:08.319 --> 01:10.355
No. Cause a distraction,
grab their guns,

01:10.446 --> 01:11.652
and shoot our way out.

01:12.031 --> 01:14.067

01:58.786 --> 02:01.118

way more than seven ships.

02:01.205 --> 02:02.194
But most importantly,

02:02.290 --> 02:04.656
your file is missing
the big ass fact
that I'm a Killjoy.

02:04.834 --> 02:06.199
There's obviously
some sort of mistake.

02:06.294 --> 02:07.500
(EXHALES SHARPLY)

02:07.586 --> 02:10.293
You hear that, guys?

Being a Killjoy wouldn't
help you survive 30 minutes,

02:20.850 --> 02:21.965
let alone 30 years.

02:23.060 --> 02:24.095
Back up. Did you say...

02:24.186 --> 02:25.175
30 years?

02:25.271 --> 02:26.681
Seems like you're
getting off easy to me.

02:26.772 --> 02:29.809
You did kill
your entire platoon
before going AWOL.

02:29.900 --> 02:31.231
That wasn't me.

02:31.527 --> 02:34.064
l was under the influence
of a military
mind control device.

02:35.781 --> 02:36.861
I'm better now.

02:36.949 --> 02:39.110
Obviously there has been
some sort of confusion.

02:39.243 --> 02:42.360
It's possible that you
are stuck in a false memory.

02:42.663 --> 02:45.245
Have you experienced
loss of time?

02:45.333 --> 02:46.698
Nosebleeds?

02:46.792 --> 02:49.454
Strange things that
you can't fully explain?

02:49.545 --> 02:51.126
Other than this conversation?

02:51.255 --> 02:52.916
You are missing some
very important facts here.

02:53.007 --> 02:53.996
Okay?

02:54.091 --> 02:55.206
So let me enlighten you.

02:55.301 --> 02:57.383
I love itwhen men
explain things to me.

02:57.470 --> 03:00.007
There's this alien.
She's called The Lady.

03:00.306 --> 03:01.512
She wants my son.

03:01.599 --> 03:03.885
lam quite possibly
the best thief in the J

03:03.976 --> 03:05.887

the best hacker.

03:10.441 --> 03:12.022

with goo" people.

03:12.151 --> 03:13.766
And you look like
a smart cookie.

03:13.861 --> 03:15.476
Someone that can tell
that my valuable skills

03:15.571 --> 03:17.311
would be wasted
on hard labor.

03:17.406 --> 03:20.318
My team are the only people
who can stop her

03:20.409 --> 03:22.491
from terraforming the Quad.

03:22.578 --> 03:24.364
So you can see why
I need out of here.

03:24.455 --> 03:25.695
So, let's make a deal.

03:27.291 --> 03:29.452
I think I understand.
You do?

03:29.585 --> 03:31.450

what to do with you.

03:41.180 --> 03:43.045
Well, that could
have gone better.

has received the prisoners

03:54.276 --> 03:55.732

to keep them alive.

03:56.195 --> 03:57.856
Only one of them, Khlyen.

03:58.406 --> 04:00.488
We only need one as bait.

04:00.574 --> 04:01.563
Yes.

04:01.659 --> 04:03.991
Those were my instructions
to the Warden.

04:05.413 --> 04:06.823
"Keep one alive."

04:06.914 --> 04:07.903
Stop.

04:10.209 --> 04:11.619
Did I excuse you?

04:12.962 --> 04:13.997
Forgive me.

04:15.798 --> 04:18.289
I allow you these freedoms
only as long

04:18.384 --> 04:20.295
as they serve my purpose.

04:20.428 --> 04:22.589
Of course.
It won't happen again.

04:25.975 --> 04:29.342
You hope Dutch will be
the one to survive, don't you?

04:31.856 --> 04:34.188
Every father is driven
to protect his own child.

04:34.275 --> 04:35.936
Every good father.

04:36.986 --> 04:38.977
Were you a good father,
Khlyen?

04:41.949 --> 04:43.735

I can for you.

even the big boys hard.

11:18.804 --> 11:19.964
Oh, yeah, no, there's boys

11:20.055 --> 11:21.670
a lot bigger than you
in this joint.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.881

That's why I'm in here.

11:23.976 --> 11:25.762

you'll stay here, too.

I didn't get a second lunch.

Is it dessert?
Did you get dessert?

13:39.903 --> 13:40.983

John, you gotta
get me out of here.

14:07.305 --> 14:08.920
Don't worry,
I got an exit plan.

14:09.016 --> 14:10.881
We're in a supermax, obvs,

14:10.976 --> 14:12.841
and the oxygen vents
suggest recycled air,

14:12.936 --> 14:14.927
and the layout indicates
a vertical structure.

14:15.022 --> 14:17.308
We're underground,
which means access tunnels
for maintenance.

14:17.399 --> 14:20.436
So all we gotta do
is find one and climb
to the freedomy surface.

14:20.569 --> 14:21.604
Great plan.

14:21.945 --> 14:24.652
Except Dutch is in solitary
and I'm in the looney bin.

14:24.990 --> 14:26.105
In your defense,

14:26.199 --> 14:28.110
we've all been through
a lot the past few days.

14:28.410 --> 14:29.820
And it was
a shorter walk for you.

14:29.911 --> 14:30.900
What about you?

14:31.621 --> 14:32.747
Losing Lucy?

14:33.248 --> 14:34.988
Losing Dutch?
I didn't lose Dutch.

14:35.083 --> 14:37.460
She's just temporarily
locked in a cupboard.

14:38.462 --> 14:39.497
Come on.

If anyone should feel awkward
about this situation, it's me.

14:43.216 --> 14:44.672
Shit, John, you were married.

14:45.260 --> 14:46.966
You and Dutch
have always been tight.

14:47.054 --> 14:48.544
Dutch has what
she needs to escape.

14:49.056 --> 14:52.093
You... you need
an electro-shock halo.

14:52.601 --> 14:54.967

are for nutjobs.

I'm not crazy.

No,no,no.No,no.

15:06.531 --> 15:07.611
No, come on. Oh, no.

15:13.246 --> 15:15.157
You sure no one saw us
drag him down here?

15:15.248 --> 15:17.409
No, but somebody sure felt it.

15:18.376 --> 15:20.367
Was it necessary
to hit every rung?

15:21.546 --> 15:24.538
Not to mention
the killer headache those
wakeup darts gave me.

15:25.967 --> 15:27.548
Maybe that's just the fumes.

15:27.886 --> 15:30.548
Look, no one saw us
because no one ever sees me

15:30.639 --> 15:33.051
and that is the power
of the raincoat.

15:33.141 --> 15:35.427
You know, that thing doesn't
actually make you invisible.

15:35.519 --> 15:37.100
If only you could
hide the smell.

15:38.313 --> 15:40.019
So, let's have it.

15:40.107 --> 15:41.938
Man-bun and I
need to catch up.

15:42.275 --> 15:43.811

Seriously?

15:43.902 --> 15:46.018

you were head of the RAC?

15:46.113 --> 15:47.102
Oh, chipmunk.

15:47.197 --> 15:49.028
I hate how good I was at it.

15:49.116 --> 15:50.356
The sit is bad.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.111
Team Awesome Force
was captured by The Lady

15:54.079 --> 15:56.115
and is currently terraforming
all of Westerley

15:56.248 --> 15:58.113
for her creepy offspring.

15:58.208 --> 15:59.448
That's a kick in the taint.

15:59.543 --> 16:02.159
We were trying to stop
the memory rain
when Dutch was captured.

16:02.254 --> 16:04.085
Now we're running out of time
before terraforming

16:04.172 --> 16:06.254
is complete and everyone dies.

16:06.341 --> 16:08.047
By my count, 25 days.

16:08.135 --> 16:10.126
We need to wake up
Westerley, fast.

16:10.220 --> 16:12.552
Yeah, starting with Gared.
The more people we wake up,

16:12.681 --> 16:14.592
the more attention
we risk drawing to ourselves.

16:14.891 --> 16:17.098
If The Lady catches us
she'll wipe us again or worse.

16:17.352 --> 16:20.469
He's safer in the dark,
till we have a plan
to stop her.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.310
I'm trying to decide
who I trust him with less.

16:24.401 --> 16:26.562
The Lady, or Cindy.

16:27.320 --> 16:28.309
Yeah.

16:29.114 --> 16:32.402
So, Mr. RAC, we need
to find Dutch and the boys.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.073
Where's The Lady
keep her prisoners?

16:34.161 --> 16:35.367
How should I know?

16:35.453 --> 16:36.784
The RAC doesn't work
for The Lady.

16:37.247 --> 16:40.205
Take no sides,
take no bribes.
Blah, blah. Warrant.

is on lockdown.

taken them that far.

16:45.338 --> 16:47.374
Well, there is a dead spot

16:47.632 --> 16:50.044
on the live map
of the Salt Plains.

16:50.385 --> 16:52.341
I noticed it when I borrowed
a company tablet

16:52.429 --> 16:53.714
to search for the Widow.

16:53.930 --> 16:56.637
Huh. I've seen Black
Root ships flying in
from the south.

16:56.725 --> 16:59.262
That sounds like
an underground

18:02.332 --> 18:04.072
So we are in
a subterranean prison.

18:04.167 --> 18:05.748
All we gotta do is find
an access tunnel,

18:05.835 --> 18:07.166
climb to the surface.

18:07.254 --> 18:08.710
Okay, so where's D'av?

18:08.797 --> 18:10.253
We need to go get him.

18:10.924 --> 18:12.289
Out of the psych ward.

18:12.384 --> 18:14.170
I guess The Lady
did a number on our heads.

Yeah, yours especially.

18:16.263 --> 18:18.345

18:18.431 --> 18:19.420
Excuse me.

18:20.767 --> 18:22.132
So, how do we get D'av out?

18:23.144 --> 18:25.055

18:34.781 --> 18:36.692
You think we can rewire
this thing to zap him

18:36.783 --> 18:38.284
for eating my yogurt
out of the fridge?

18:38.451 --> 18:40.407
Please don't tell me this is
just for your entertainment.

18:40.495 --> 18:41.655

So, escaping prison, check.

18:57.262 --> 18:59.469
Next step in our
defeat-The-Lady-plan?

18:59.681 --> 19:01.342
Wake everyone up
on Westerley,

19:01.516 --> 19:02.676
stop the terraforming,

19:02.767 --> 19:05.053
destroy The Lady
and all her creepy offspring.

19:05.186 --> 19:07.313

to stop the rain, weapons,

19:07.397 --> 19:09.183
and a shit-ton of manpower
to fight The Lady's forces.

19:09.274 --> 19:11.560
That is, ifwe can manage
to get out of this hells-hole.

19:11.651 --> 19:13.437
Easy. There should be
an access tunnel
to the surface

19:13.528 --> 19:14.734
down that hall.

19:14.821 --> 19:16.436
And then we're home free.

19:16.906 --> 19:17.895

19:19.034 --> 19:21.116
After a slight detour.

19:21.661 --> 19:23.777
John,John,
that's the Warden's office.

19:23.872 --> 19:25.578
Which is the opposite
to escaping.

19:25.665 --> 19:27.166
I know it may be surprising,

19:27.250 --> 19:29.286
but even in my thrillingly
capable hands,

19:29.377 --> 19:31.288
a hacked halo
can only get you so far.

19:31.463 --> 19:33.078
Now, I can get us
access to the tunnels,

19:33.214 --> 19:34.465
but I can't open
the surface hatch

get as far as you did.

Makes me wonder
if you really are Killjoys.

Is that why you didn't
kill us for trying?

No.

20:47.497 --> 20:48.953
My guess is money.

You're being paid
to keep us alive, aren't you?

to keep one of you alive.

21:07.642 --> 21:09.257
Help me with this task,

21:09.352 --> 21:10.853
and I'll transfer you
to G Wing.

you might all survive.

21:15.442 --> 21:16.557
So, what's the task?

21:16.651 --> 21:17.891
I've been hearing rumors that

21:17.986 --> 21:19.977
there's a hit planned
on a powerful inmate.

21:20.447 --> 21:22.608
Sparlow. Leader of Herks'
biggest gang.

21:22.699 --> 21:24.655
Rumor is, it's happening
any day now.

21:25.076 --> 21:26.691
I'm sending you
into X Wing.

21:26.786 --> 21:29.448
Oh, that sounds bad.
Mmm-hmm.

21:29.539 --> 21:32.622
I want you to find out
who ordered this hit

21:33.168 --> 21:35.955
and how they got their fingers
into my prison.

21:36.296 --> 21:38.002
Funny how that rumor
didn't cover that part.

21:38.089 --> 21:39.670
Well, my informants
either don't know

21:39.757 --> 21:41.497
or they're too afraid
to tell me.

Anyone with the balls
to go after Sparlow
must be one scary bastard.

21:45.472 --> 21:47.929
What, too scary
for your heavily armed staff

of trained guards
to look into?

21:50.018 --> 21:51.883
Now, I own you.

21:55.982 --> 21:57.973
WARDEN:
I control everything
this side of the bars

21:58.067 --> 22:00.149
but Sparlow controls
everything behind them.

22:03.364 --> 22:04.353
(CHATTER OVER COMMUNICATOR)

22:04.449 --> 22:06.314
Even my guards
are afraid of him.

22:08.453 --> 22:11.661
But, ifyou can find out
who is behind the hit,

22:12.290 --> 22:15.748
l'll transfer you
out of the hypermax
and into G Wing.

22:16.544 --> 22:18.455
JOHN: Not only does G Wing
have better food,

22:18.546 --> 22:19.956
it also has lower security.

22:20.089 --> 22:21.954
I guarantee you,
we can escape G Wing.

22:22.050 --> 22:23.711
DUTCH: We've gotta
survive X Wing first.

22:23.968 --> 22:24.957
Piece of cake.

22:25.345 --> 22:27.006
As long as no one finds out
we're Killjoys, we...

22:27.096 --> 22:28.711
lNMATE 1: What do we got here?

22:28.890 --> 22:30.801
(INMATES SHOUTING)

22:32.727 --> 22:34.968
...might survive.

22:35.897 --> 22:37.558
lNMATE 2: Look, fresh fish!

22:39.776 --> 22:41.357
John, what the hells?

22:41.444 --> 22:43.435
First rule of prison:
Pick a fight
with the biggest guy.

22:43.530 --> 22:44.610
Everyone else
will leave you alone.

22:44.697 --> 22:46.688
Yeah, he's not the biggest.

22:46.783 --> 22:47.989
And your brother.

22:48.618 --> 22:50.825
Well, ifyou can't be scary,
be unpredictable.

23:02.423 --> 23:03.583
Do you want to open it?

23:04.968 --> 23:06.504
I suspect I'd rather not.

23:07.720 --> 23:10.211
They can't survive
in this atmosphere yet.

23:11.391 --> 23:12.380
Butsoon.

23:14.727 --> 23:16.843
She killed
some of my hatchlings,

23:16.938 --> 23:20.146
butlcan
always create more.

23:20.858 --> 23:22.473
So, you're cloning
an army?

23:22.569 --> 23:24.434
Am I expected
to be impressed?

23:24.946 --> 23:26.482
You're expected to be afraid.

23:26.573 --> 23:27.562
VVhy?

23:27.865 --> 23:30.026
Your species
went extinct before.

23:31.077 --> 23:32.578
You can be defeated again.

23:34.080 --> 23:36.492
Do you know what separates
my kind from yours?

23:36.874 --> 23:39.456
I'd say the urge to
annihilate everything else

23:40.128 --> 23:41.959
but sadly,
I know my own species.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.373
Emotional memories.

23:44.173 --> 23:46.585
You relive past experiences,

23:46.676 --> 23:48.883
keeping them alive,
meaningful.

23:49.178 --> 23:50.509
When you remember
where you have been,

23:50.597 --> 23:52.428
you dream of
where you might go.

23:53.141 --> 23:54.927
Your obsession
with the future,

23:55.018 --> 23:58.727
your ambition is because
you can't forget your past.

23:59.731 --> 24:01.471
I will take that from you,

24:01.566 --> 24:03.272
give it to my people,

24:03.943 --> 24:05.774
teach them to dream of more,

24:05.862 --> 24:07.853
and then we will be perfect.

24:10.283 --> 24:13.491
So, Sparlow seems nice.

24:13.578 --> 24:16.160
Someone who needs that
much protection must be.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.783
Can't even get close to him.

24:18.124 --> 24:19.580
lfwe're gonna
save him from a hit

24:19.667 --> 24:22.659
we need to get,
like, underwear close.

24:22.920 --> 24:24.126
What do you
know about him?

24:24.213 --> 24:25.464
According to
the Warden's intel,

24:25.548 --> 24:28.210
he's got every market
in here covered.
Booze, drugs, toilet paper.

24:28.301 --> 24:30.257
Okay, so Sparlow's
a businessman.

24:30.345 --> 24:31.710
We need to approach him
with business.

24:31.804 --> 24:34.090
What the hells
can we offer him
from inside here?

24:36.643 --> 24:39.134
Warned you,
food's way better
in the psych ward.

24:39.228 --> 24:40.559
Hey, Calvert.

24:40.647 --> 24:41.636
How did you get out?

24:41.731 --> 24:42.891
Oh, you made a new friend?

24:42.982 --> 24:43.971
Well, I'm very charming.

24:44.067 --> 24:45.056
Ugh!

24:45.151 --> 24:47.608
Finished my eval.
Not bonkers.

24:47.779 --> 24:49.565
So they got me back
on kitchen detail.

24:49.781 --> 24:51.066
What about you?
How'd you pull it off?

24:51.157 --> 24:52.567
No one comes back
from a halo.

24:52.659 --> 24:54.320
He barely has
a residual twitch.

24:55.036 --> 24:58.528
Do you have any other tips
like how to get better food?

24:59.666 --> 25:00.746
See that?

25:00.833 --> 25:03.245
That's the good slop.

25:03.336 --> 25:05.748
lt's reserved
for Sparlow's crew.

25:06.172 --> 25:08.163
As long as | make sure
they get the good stuff,

25:08.508 --> 25:10.499
Sparlow makes sure
I don't get my ass kicked.

25:10.802 --> 25:11.791
Much.

25:16.349 --> 25:17.634
We found our way in.

25:17.975 --> 25:19.590
ZEPH:
Okay, let’s find Dutch.

25:19.852 --> 25:22.264
lt's latitude 43.7,

25:22.647 --> 25:25.263
longitude 79.13.

25:25.692 --> 25:27.853
There it is. The dead zone.

25:27.944 --> 25:30.777
I couldn't get close enough
on foot to get eyes on it,

25:30.863 --> 25:33.821
but I clocked two guards
at regular patrols.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.781
You gonna
liven that up some?

25:36.077 --> 25:38.739
Okay, so this is two feeds
streaming at once.

25:39.205 --> 25:42.572
The dead spot is a dummy feed
layered over top of...

25:43.292 --> 25:46.079
(WHISTLES) A whole shit-ton
of Black Root ships.

25:46.337 --> 25:48.999
Clearly this is not
where The Lady is keeping
Dutch and the boys.

25:49.090 --> 25:50.330
Spaceships and limited guards

25:50.425 --> 25:52.040
doesn't exactly
say detention site.

25:52.343 --> 25:54.299
PREE: What is this place?
An opportunity.

25:54.804 --> 25:57.261
We may not know where
Team Awesome Force is yet

25:57.348 --> 25:59.885
but now we know where
our enemy keeps her ships.

26:00.059 --> 26:02.926
So, let's go kick her
in the cockpit.

26:07.358 --> 26:08.347
Hey.

26:09.318 --> 26:11.058
I want a meeting
with Sparlow.

26:11.154 --> 26:12.610
I've got something
he'll want to see.

26:12.989 --> 26:14.604
Sparlow has seen it all.

26:15.575 --> 26:17.236
And he's not accepting
any applications

26:17.326 --> 26:19.032
for any new sexers.

26:20.830 --> 26:24.118
Oh, I've got something
much more beautiful and rare.

26:33.968 --> 26:35.754
You oughta let me
try it first, boss,

26:35.845 --> 26:37.301
in case it's poisoned.

26:37.638 --> 26:40.095
Our new guest is going
to test it for poison.

26:40.183 --> 26:41.298
I don't like it.

26:41.684 --> 26:42.764
What if it's a trick?

26:43.603 --> 26:45.685
Luckily, what you like
doesn't matter for shit

26:45.772 --> 26:47.057
in my operation.

26:57.492 --> 26:58.652
Mmm.

26:58.743 --> 26:59.949
Satisfied?

27:04.290 --> 27:06.030
I can't be friends
with your corpse.

27:06.250 --> 27:08.536
Okay, "friend."

27:10.713 --> 27:11.748
But how?

27:12.465 --> 27:15.002
Even I can't get food in here
and I can get anything.

27:15.092 --> 27:16.298
Trade secret.

27:17.136 --> 27:19.172
I'm not interested
in competing with you.

27:19.722 --> 27:21.838
lwanna fill in the gaps
in your supply chain.

27:21.933 --> 27:23.048
How come I don't know you?

27:23.142 --> 27:24.473
People like me get sent

27:24.560 --> 27:26.471
to places like this
to be forgotten.

27:26.687 --> 27:27.847
Political prisoner?

27:27.939 --> 27:29.679
There's a war
going on in Westerley.

27:30.858 --> 27:33.691
Not that anyone else
in the rest of the Quad
knows about it.

27:33.778 --> 27:35.860
No one gives a shit
about Westerley.

27:36.906 --> 27:39.693
But there's always
room at my table
for another dirt eater.

27:42.870 --> 27:43.859
Salt Plains.

27:43.955 --> 27:45.286
Born and crazed.

27:45.581 --> 27:49.119
(SINGING) Kill the Killjoys
stab them in the eyeballs

27:49.210 --> 27:53.044
Kill the Killjoys
stab them in the skull!

27:53.798 --> 27:54.787
Tits.

27:56.259 --> 27:57.544
Coren Jeers!

27:58.845 --> 28:01.678
Thanks for doing that stint
in solitary, my man.

28:01.764 --> 28:02.844
You got it.

28:09.564 --> 28:10.644
You.

28:12.233 --> 28:13.439
Coren.

28:13.526 --> 28:15.608
What an unpleasant surprise.

28:16.153 --> 28:17.233
You know each other?

28:19.949 --> 28:22.736
(EXCITEDLY) Oh, yeah.

28:22.827 --> 28:26.194
This is the RAC's
resident bitch.

28:26.289 --> 28:29.622
Which means
that your weird little

28:29.709 --> 28:33.293
sister-wives sidekicks
can't be far behind? Mmm?

28:33.796 --> 28:35.036
Hey. Hey-

28:35.464 --> 28:38.206
Thought you were doing
your time in Westhole, Coren.

28:38.593 --> 28:40.003
Wait, didn't it blow up?

28:40.094 --> 28:42.460
Maybe not the best time
to bring that up, D'av.

28:42.722 --> 28:46.340
I got escalated
out of Westhole
for my bad behavior.

28:47.101 --> 28:48.932
Turns out I got
a lot of anger issues

28:49.020 --> 28:52.604
about the asshole
bounty hunters
who put me in prison!

28:52.773 --> 28:53.762
DUTCH: Coren, think.

28:54.066 --> 28:56.273
No need to make a scene.
We can work something out.

28:56.360 --> 28:57.645
(ULULATlNG)

28:58.195 --> 29:00.447
Sharpen your shivs, folks.

29:01.032 --> 29:03.023
There are Killjoys
in our midst.

29:03.117 --> 29:05.153
AUTOMATED FEMALE VOICE:
Riot protocol initiated.

29:05.870 --> 29:08.407
Riot protocol initiated.

29:08.623 --> 29:10.830
Riot protocol initiated.

29:17.882 --> 29:21.215
Well, you cocked that up
fast, didn't you?

29:25.765 --> 29:27.756
I can't believe I sacrificed

29:27.850 --> 29:30.637
one of my precious apples
for that.

29:30.895 --> 29:33.136
Not only didn't you find out
who's behind the hit,

29:33.230 --> 29:35.482
but you managed to make sure
every asshole in here

29:35.566 --> 29:37.773
wants you dead.
Oh, it's our process.

29:37.902 --> 29:40.109
It looks like we're failing
until we don't.

29:40.446 --> 29:41.947
l'm throwing you
back in solitary.

29:42.907 --> 29:44.863
I get paid
to keep one of you
shitheads alive

29:44.951 --> 29:47.033
and thanks to you
for blowing your cover,

29:47.119 --> 29:48.700
that just got a lot harder.

29:49.330 --> 29:50.319
No.

29:50.873 --> 29:53.455
You're gonna release
all three of us
back into X Wing.

29:53.542 --> 29:55.282
We're gonna do you
one better than finding out

29:55.378 --> 29:56.868
who ordered the hit.
We're gonna stop it.

29:56.963 --> 29:58.078
Because you can
pull that off?

29:58.172 --> 29:59.457
Well, you said it yourself.

29:59.548 --> 30:01.163
Your guards definitely can't.

30:01.258 --> 30:03.294
So, I'll throw Sparlow
in solitary, too.

30:03.552 --> 30:04.712
Or...

30:05.972 --> 30:07.508
you let the hit go down.

30:08.307 --> 30:09.763
Find out who's behind it.

30:10.601 --> 30:13.468
Which is what
you really want, isn't it?

30:13.562 --> 30:16.429
We have Sparlow
exactly where we need him

30:16.524 --> 30:18.060
to draw out the assassin.

30:18.526 --> 30:20.482
While everyone's
looking at us,

30:20.945 --> 30:23.186
the hitman will feel safer
making his move.

30:23.280 --> 30:25.236
Then we grab him alive
for you to question

30:25.324 --> 30:27.189
to your little
angry heart's desire.

30:27.284 --> 30:28.865
And what about
the other prisoners?

30:29.537 --> 30:31.528
I can't protect you
from all ofX Wing.

30:31.747 --> 30:32.736
(CHUCKLES SOFTLY)

30:33.249 --> 30:35.035
We're used to people
wanting us dead.

30:35.584 --> 30:36.835
Hasn't stopped us yet.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.172
And two guards.

30:43.259 --> 30:44.544
See?

30:44.635 --> 30:46.091
You miss this
when you're in the delusion.

30:46.345 --> 30:48.722
Now you're back
in your element
stirring shit up.

30:48.848 --> 30:50.713
Yeah, well, that's the thing
about stirring shit.

30:50.933 --> 30:52.264
You're still in shit.

30:52.351 --> 30:54.057
| just don't get why The Lady
would leave her fleet

30:54.145 --> 30:56.136
of Black Root ships
just sitting here empty,

30:56.230 --> 30:58.516
with so few guards.

30:58.607 --> 31:00.108
Maybe for once
we don't ask questions

31:00.192 --> 31:01.853
that probably have
craptastic answers.

31:01.944 --> 31:03.855
Maybe we just get down
to blowing up ships

31:03.946 --> 31:05.231
like we came here to do.

31:05.364 --> 31:07.696
It's on pre-programmed
autopilot.

31:08.701 --> 31:11.113
This ship has logged
the same flight path
every day

31:11.203 --> 31:12.659
for the past 44 days

31:12.747 --> 31:15.454
but it's just doing
a circuit at 10,000 feet.

31:15.541 --> 31:17.281
That's barely
above cloud cover.

31:18.335 --> 31:19.541
Oh! Oh!

31:20.212 --> 31:21.292
Payload tanks are full

31:21.380 --> 31:23.166
and set to jettison
when we hit altitude.

31:23.257 --> 31:26.124
Turin, this is how The Lady
is seeding the clouds.

31:26.218 --> 31:28.504
These Black Root ships,
and whatever's in their tanks.

31:29.013 --> 31:30.628
This is how
she's making the rain.

31:33.350 --> 31:34.965
I'm not complaining
about hiding in here

31:35.061 --> 31:37.393
since half the prison
wants to kill us,

31:38.606 --> 31:39.812
but do you really think
the hitman

31:39.899 --> 31:41.639
is one of Sparlow's
own entourage?

31:41.734 --> 31:43.770
Well, if three badass Killjoys

31:43.861 --> 31:45.817
can't get past them
to Sparlow,

31:45.905 --> 31:47.816
a prison hitman
wouldn't be able to either.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.407
This is nice.

31:58.334 --> 31:59.414
Just the two of us,

31:59.502 --> 32:01.413
working angles,
doing business.

32:02.296 --> 32:03.797
Normal Killjoy shit.

32:05.716 --> 32:08.298
Normal "us" shit.

32:10.179 --> 32:12.010
Not that I'm assuming
everything's normal.

32:12.098 --> 32:13.884
And there's zero pressure.

32:15.267 --> 32:16.518
A lot has changed.

32:17.853 --> 32:19.104
Weird memories.

32:20.064 --> 32:22.646
People thinking
they had babies together.

32:22.733 --> 32:24.849
Yeah, fake memories.
We're all awake now.

32:24.944 --> 32:26.184
Why would anything change?

32:26.362 --> 32:27.568
I don't know, it...

32:29.323 --> 32:31.029
could be confusing.

32:31.700 --> 32:32.689
People...

32:33.327 --> 32:35.318
People could be confused.

32:35.496 --> 32:36.781
By this conversation?

32:39.583 --> 32:41.119
It's a vulnerable time
for John.

32:41.210 --> 32:42.620
I know what
you're gonna say.

32:44.588 --> 32:45.839
(SIGHS)

32:47.258 --> 32:48.247
Yeah.

32:48.759 --> 32:50.169
He blames me.

32:52.304 --> 32:54.215
He lost the love of his life.

32:54.765 --> 32:57.256
Wow. Okay...

32:57.351 --> 32:58.431
Okay, yeah.

33:00.396 --> 33:02.933
Guess I was sort of
in denial about it, but...

33:03.858 --> 33:05.394
Yeah, if we're
gonna go there.

33:08.154 --> 33:09.519
Love of his life.

33:10.614 --> 33:12.479
And I think he wants it back.

33:13.075 --> 33:14.235
So do I.

33:15.536 --> 33:18.369
Piece of my heart
is gone, too, D'avin.

33:23.335 --> 33:24.711
So you wanna...

33:25.546 --> 33:26.661
be with John?

33:28.299 --> 33:29.288
What?

33:29.383 --> 33:30.839
No? Wait...

33:31.093 --> 33:32.674
What are we talking about?

33:32.761 --> 33:35.343
I'm talking about Lucy.
About all of us missing Lucy.

33:35.431 --> 33:36.546
Right. Yes, absolutely.

33:36.640 --> 33:38.050
That is absolutely what
I'm talking about, too.

33:38.142 --> 33:39.302
D'avin Jaqobis...

33:40.686 --> 33:41.971
Tattoo-face guy.

33:45.191 --> 33:46.852
CRONIE: Weight room's
all clear for you, boss.

34:00.915 --> 34:02.655
All right, guys,
the coast is clear.

34:06.879 --> 34:08.665
You better cross your legs

34:08.756 --> 34:11.919
so we can have
a nice little chat.

34:13.552 --> 34:15.292
Oh, come on, Dutch.

34:15.387 --> 34:16.467
Too much pressure
to the windpipe.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.261
Elite assassin 101.

34:18.349 --> 34:20.635
I didn't put any pressure
on his windpipe.

34:23.771 --> 34:25.682
There's burnt lilac
on his breath.

34:25.940 --> 34:28.727
That's what Ryklex smells like
when it's ingested orally.

34:29.068 --> 34:30.808
It's a powerful...
Sedative, yeah.

34:30.903 --> 34:32.109
lam familiar.

34:32.196 --> 34:33.811
Yeah, but we've been
watching him all day.

34:33.948 --> 34:36.189
How did someone get
close enough to Sparlow's
entourage to drug him?

34:36.283 --> 34:37.614
Must have been
in something he ate.

34:38.077 --> 34:40.159
Ryklex, access to food...

34:40.579 --> 34:41.785
God, damn it.

34:42.414 --> 34:43.403

34:49.421 --> 34:50.957

Yep, it's all you.

34:51.048 --> 34:52.504
It's all you. It's all you.

34:54.343 --> 34:55.458
Come on, boss,
you got this.

35:35.301 --> 35:37.212
Pretty violent, though.
I can see why you got a halo.

35:37.344 --> 35:39.505
Oh, you don't know
how violent we can be.

35:43.767 --> 35:45.507
What kind of stims is she on?

35:46.478 --> 35:47.729
DUTCH: The good kind!

35:54.528 --> 35:56.610

on kitchen patrol?

36:34.526 --> 36:35.777
How many weight bars
am | holding up?

36:35.861 --> 36:37.817
Just the one that
almost killed me.

36:38.030 --> 36:40.112
Do you know what makes
a great thank you gift?

36:40.407 --> 36:42.238
Protection, for starters.

36:42.326 --> 36:43.691
Don't push it, Killjoy.

You know, this thing
really is heavy.

36:48.624 --> 36:49.784
All right, all right.

36:49.875 --> 36:52.207
I'll put the word out that
you're under my protection.

36:52.294 --> 36:53.283
Uh-huh.

36:53.379 --> 36:55.244
And I officially
owe you one.

(SHARP GRUNT)

36:58.926 --> 37:00.006
(PANTING)

37:01.011 --> 37:03.002
But I wanna know
who she's working for.

37:05.766 --> 37:07.927
The Warden wants to know
who's behind the hit.

37:08.018 --> 37:09.633
She'll probably
cut you a deal.

37:10.062 --> 37:13.304
Give a name and I'll hand you
over to the Warden

37:13.399 --> 37:14.684
instead of Sparlow, here.

37:16.360 --> 37:18.021
You think I wanna
be doing this?

37:18.987 --> 37:20.318
lt's notjust about me.

37:20.489 --> 37:23.481
Besides, it don't mean shit
ifword gets out
that I talked.

37:23.575 --> 37:26.817
Dutch hands you
over to the Warden
and you disappear.

37:26.912 --> 37:28.994
No one needs to know
that you sang.

37:30.082 --> 37:32.368
But I need to know
who's coming after me.

37:33.919 --> 37:35.455
Or I'm coming after you.

37:37.339 --> 37:39.000
Coren Jeers.

37:39.508 --> 37:41.715
He wants your turf, Sparlow.

37:41.802 --> 37:45.590
That dirty
double-crossing shitstain!

37:45.806 --> 37:48.718
Yeah, shitstain's
kind of his brand.

37:52.604 --> 37:54.686
pieces of you out of
the floor grids by now.

37:55.774 --> 37:56.854
I'll take it from here.

38:05.742 --> 38:09.360
In the meantime,
I owe you and your boys
a transfer to G Wing.

38:09.455 --> 38:12.037
Actually, we'd rather
stay in X Wing.

38:12.332 --> 38:13.913
You think Sparlow
will protect you?

38:14.001 --> 38:15.866
I think we've survived
in worse places.

38:15.961 --> 38:18.043
But it's a lot
harder to do when you're
turning down favors

38:18.130 --> 38:19.666
of a person
who runs this place.

38:21.216 --> 38:22.376
Remember that, Yardeen.

38:25.304 --> 38:27.590
What were you thinking
turning down
a transfer, Dutch?

38:27.681 --> 38:28.966
In G Wing we'd have...

38:29.057 --> 38:30.388
D'AVIN:
Better Chance of escaping.
Better food.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.512
We need to get back
to Westerley and get Jaq.

38:32.603 --> 38:33.718
And then what?

38:34.396 --> 38:36.011
Fight The Lady,
as per ushe.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.306
Look, we've never
faced an enemy
as powerful as The Lady.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.140
She can literally control
people's minds.

38:40.277 --> 38:41.392
We're outmatched.

38:41.487 --> 38:43.728
So she has the upper hand.
We'll take it back.

38:45.491 --> 38:47.322
The only good place
in Hell is on top.

38:47.409 --> 38:49.024
We need to take over
this prison,

38:49.119 --> 38:50.620
use it to fight The Lady,
and we need to win.

Two inmates per cell.

38:52.706 --> 38:53.695

Well, you guys
take this one.

38:56.502 --> 38:58.493
Johnny, are you sure?
Yeah.

38:58.587 --> 39:00.418
Plan is to make scary
new friends, right?

39:01.006 --> 39:02.291
Might as well start now.

you and me, Newcy.

39:27.449 --> 39:28.780
Acknowledged, Sean.

39:28.867 --> 39:31.654
Evil is

39:32.204 --> 39:37.619
One step behind

39:40.295 --> 39:43.833
If this is the protein
The Lady's seeding
the memory rain with,

39:44.258 --> 39:46.670
I can use it to figure out
how the rain works

39:46.802 --> 39:48.212
and eventually stop it.

39:48.303 --> 39:49.634
How eventually?

39:49.721 --> 39:51.302
Hopefully in less
than 25 days.

39:52.307 --> 39:53.638
We're on a ship.

39:53.725 --> 39:56.216
The Lady controls
our airspace, but we
could make a run for it.

39:56.311 --> 39:57.391
Go get help.

39:59.565 --> 40:02.523
Westerley is already
in an advanced stage
of terraforming.

40:02.734 --> 40:05.692
Everyone in the Quad
would be able to see it
from space by now.

40:05.862 --> 40:07.648
They just don't give a shit.

40:10.576 --> 40:11.986
So, we're the help.

40:12.411 --> 40:15.448
We go back to Old Town
and we fix this shit,

40:15.622 --> 40:16.953
starting with the rain.

40:18.083 --> 40:20.495
You said it would
take some time
to figure out how to stop it.

40:20.586 --> 40:22.497
It will, but like you said,

40:22.588 --> 40:24.954
we came here to stir shit up
and blow shit up.

40:25.048 --> 40:26.424
So let's get to it.

40:27.593 --> 40:29.299
How many ships were destroyed?

40:31.179 --> 40:32.555
How many?

40:32.639 --> 40:34.345
30% of your
west seeding fleet.

40:34.433 --> 40:36.799
Do you have any idea
how many workers could wake up

40:36.893 --> 40:38.884
from their delusions
without that rain?

40:40.147 --> 40:41.182
Throw him out the airlock.

40:41.273 --> 40:43.480
No, no. Please!

40:43.650 --> 40:44.981
KHLYEN:
You still have the showers.

40:46.903 --> 40:49.235
Just increase their frequency
in the factories

40:49.364 --> 40:51.400
to keep the workers enslaved
until the ships are replaced.

40:51.491 --> 40:54.198
Be a bit Clever, Khlyen.

40:54.369 --> 40:55.700
It's not about the ships.

40:55.787 --> 40:58.369
It's that someone knew
enough to destroy them.

41:00.208 --> 41:01.584
We have a rebellion.

41:02.628 --> 41:04.619
Find out who's awake.
And then what?

41:04.713 --> 41:06.704
I don't know!

41:10.302 --> 41:12.668
All of these weak emotions.

41:13.347 --> 41:15.633
These feelings I have now.

41:16.975 --> 41:18.385
How do you manage?

41:19.645 --> 41:22.603
It's like a poison
inside of me.

41:23.690 --> 41:26.602
This body can't control them,
and I hate it.

41:27.903 --> 41:31.862
That poison is the price
of emotional memory.

41:33.492 --> 41:35.699
Now are you sure you're ready
for your Children

41:35.786 --> 41:37.322
to feel the same?

41:38.163 --> 41:40.028
Butwe aren't human.

41:40.666 --> 41:42.873
And by controlling
the human's emotions,

41:42.959 --> 41:45.291
I own their lives
and their memories

41:45.420 --> 41:47.672
so why do they
keep fighting me?

41:51.176 --> 41:53.258
You still
don't understand us.

41:55.222 --> 41:57.383
Humanity's resilience
doesn't come

41:57.474 --> 41:59.681
from our ability to remember.

It comes from
our ability to hope.
