WEBVTT

00:06.257 --> 00:07.918
Psst. Come here.

00:14.724 --> 00:16.635
We shouldn’t do this here.

00:16.726 --> 00:18.808
Yeah, I agree.

00:19.729 --> 00:21.185
We have to go.

00:21.272 --> 00:23.729
We have reservations
at Hatfield’s at 8:00.

00:23.816 --> 00:26.808
So you leave first,
I will follow,
and the night is ours.

00:26.903 --> 00:28.609
Mmm.

00:35.161 --> 00:37.652
I’m looking for
Dr. Saroyan.
Now?

00:37.747 --> 00:41.456
— I’m not taking this
home with me. Yeah, now.
— Urn, I’m Dr. Saroyan.

00:41.542 --> 00:44.249
This was found
in a hazardous waste
disposal facility.

00:44.337 --> 00:47.249
— We tried to call.
- We’re sort of closed
for the night.

00:47.340 --> 00:49.296
Yeah.
She’s had a long day.
Yeah, me too.

00:49.383 --> 00:50.793
Especially
after I saw this.

00:55.681 --> 00:58.969
Can’t really see myself
having dinner tonight.

00:59.477 --> 01:01.013
Me neither.

01:05.733 --> 01:09.396
You know, ljust think
that we need a vacation.

01:09.528 --> 01:12.110
We haven’t been away
since Christine was born.
lhave.

01:12.198 --> 01:14.063
You were running away
from the police.

01:14.158 --> 01:17.776
I’m just saying, like,
you know, the two of us,
as a couple, we get away.

01:17.912 --> 01:19.402
Hmm.
You like that,
don’t you?

01:19.497 --> 01:21.033
Ido. Oh!

01:21.165 --> 01:24.077
I’ve been meaning to visit
the outlying villages in Yangon—
[ Sighs ]

01:24.168 --> 01:26.079
to study the linguistic
characteristics of—

01:26.170 --> 01:27.785
No,no,no,
no,no,no,no.

01:27.880 --> 01:29.745
No “Langoey.”
All right?
To whatever.

01:29.882 --> 01:31.793
No.
I’m talking about
beach and mai tais.

01:31.884 --> 01:34.045
Right?
That’s a vacation—
no learning.

01:34.136 --> 01:37.594
I think you would enjoy
the epistemological nature
of their language—

01:37.682 --> 01:40.890
No! I’m talking about
beach and spa.

01:40.977 --> 01:43.559
Sex and room service
and sleeping late.

01:43.646 --> 01:46.604
Now, that is a vacation.
I wanna come back stupid.

01:46.732 --> 01:49.644

Well, how about learning
how to have fun, Bones?

01:49.735 --> 01:51.236
[Cell Phone Ringing]

01:51.320 --> 01:53.356
[Cell Phone Ringing]
Brennan.

01:53.447 --> 01:54.903
Right.

01:55.032 --> 01:56.647
Okay, where?
On my way.

01:56.784 --> 01:58.649
All right.
I’ll be there.
Dude in a barrel?

01:58.786 --> 02:01.573
l have no way of knowing
it’s a dude yet.
Or dudette. Dude, dudette.

02:01.664 --> 02:04.030
— Okay, listen,
we’ll talk about—
— Mongolia.

02:04.125 --> 02:06.116
Spain.
Ah, sangria.

02:06.210 --> 02:08.417
I’ve been there.
Christine,
help me out.

02:08.504 --> 02:10.495
Tell Mom
we need beaches.

02:13.050 --> 02:14.790
The company
is Lantech Waste Disposal.

02:14.885 --> 02:16.876
They have 60 trucks
in the tristate area.

02:17.013 --> 02:18.924
And they don’t know
where the barrels come from?
Nope.

02:19.015 --> 02:20.926
They pick up
the full ones.
They drop off empties.

02:21.017 --> 02:22.973
They’re not opened till
they get back to the plant
and they’re dropped off.

02:23.060 --> 02:25.437
— And these are all the logs?
- All the routes.

02:25.521 --> 02:27.978
It’s gonna take me weeks to go
through all these businesses
they deal with.

02:28.065 --> 02:30.932
I know. Glad I don’t
have to do it.
Have a good one.

02:37.033 --> 02:39.775
I wasn’t able
to x—ray the inside
because of the metal.

02:39.869 --> 02:43.236
So, at this point,
we’re just trying to decide
what happened to an arm.

02:43.331 --> 02:45.993
[Hodgins ] We wouldn’t have
this much soap unless there was
more victim inside there.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.539
You sure it’s soap?

02:47.626 --> 02:49.787
Well, it’s gotta
be some kind of
salt—based hydroxide...

02:49.879 --> 02:52.120
that was poured into the barrel,
dissolving our victim’s fat,

02:52.214 --> 02:53.670
which is how
you get soap.

02:53.758 --> 02:55.999
Assuming the killer
wasn’t ﬂying to make soap,

02:56.093 --> 02:59.961
I’m guessing this was
just an epically failed
attempt at a body disposal.

03:00.056 --> 03:04.345
Distance between the lunate
and the third distal phalanx
suggests the victim is male.

03:04.435 --> 03:06.721
You can tell all that
just from a hand?

03:06.812 --> 03:10.646
—Extremities can be informative.
-Are you gonna talk about
the size of a man’s feet now?

03:10.733 --> 03:12.598
A 2002 urology study
in London...

03:12.693 --> 03:14.399
showed that there
was no correlation...

03:14.487 --> 03:17.229
between the size
of a man’s penis
and the size of his feet.

03:17.323 --> 03:19.780
That was a study?
They should’ve just called.

03:19.867 --> 03:23.200
It’s nice how close we all are,
but maybe we should
just focus on soap man here.

03:23.287 --> 03:26.529
Are you able to
estimate time of death
based on the soap compound?

03:26.624 --> 03:30.037
At this point, all I know
is that it would take
approximately 24 hours...

03:30.127 --> 03:33.745
for the chemical to actually
dissolve our friend here
down to the bone.

03:33.839 --> 03:35.875
- Wow, that’s fast.
— Yeah, yeah.

03:35.966 --> 03:41.506
But add on to that
12 to 24 hours for the soap
to actually harden and set.

03:41.597 --> 03:45.010
So we’re looking
at a minimum
of 36 to 48 hours.

03:45.101 --> 03:48.309
From when the victim actually
entered into the barrel?
Yes, that is correct.

03:48.396 --> 03:52.309
And any bones that are
still in there could be
decomposing as well.

03:52.400 --> 03:53.981
- I’m on it. Ready?
- Yeah.

03:54.068 --> 03:56.059
This should do it.

03:58.906 --> 04:01.613
- [ Hodgins Laughs]
Oh!
— [ Brennan] Okay.

04:01.700 --> 04:05.363
Let me know when the bones
are clean, Mr. Vaziri.

04:05.454 --> 04:08.912
Bones are clean?
I think the soap
already did that.

04:47.455 --> 04:50.492
The victim’s broad nasal
aperture with a
rounded nasal sill,

04:50.583 --> 04:52.289
in combination with
the protruding...

04:52.376 --> 04:54.492
nature of the mandible,
suggests negroid.

04:54.587 --> 04:56.669
Based on the shape
of the skull,

04:56.755 --> 04:58.962
probably West African
in origin.

04:59.049 --> 05:02.837
If you could get me some kind
of age range, it would help
with facial reconstruction.

05:02.928 --> 05:05.920
There’s no osteoarthritic
osteophytes anywhere.

05:06.015 --> 05:08.552
Yeah, I was kind of hoping
forthat in years.

05:08.642 --> 05:10.223
Between 20 and 30 years.

05:10.311 --> 05:11.926
Are these areas
bone lesions?

05:13.898 --> 05:15.934
Bone cancer maybe.

05:17.776 --> 05:20.813
Or... thymosis,
also known as yaws?

05:20.905 --> 05:22.441
What’s that?

05:22.531 --> 05:25.648
It’s a tropical disease, common
in children in sub—Saharan Africa.

05:25.743 --> 05:29.986
The victim may very well
have grown up in Africa.

05:35.377 --> 05:36.833
You got a hit already?

05:36.921 --> 05:39.287
Yeah. I didn’t need much
of a facial reconstruction.

05:39.381 --> 05:41.997
There’s only
so many West Africans
on the Missing Persons list.

05:42.092 --> 05:44.219
Symchay Conteh.

05:44.303 --> 05:47.761
Age 24. Reported missing
by Alvin James.

05:47.848 --> 05:50.009
The FBI.
is chasing down
117 Alvin Jameses.

05:50.100 --> 05:52.842
- But I think
it’s a fake name.
- Why?

05:52.937 --> 05:56.725
I ran the Missing Persons report
through an N.S.A.
voice analyzer program, and—

05:56.815 --> 05:58.851
[Man /
My friend is missing.

05:58.943 --> 06:00.808
His name
is Symcna y Conteh.

06:00.945 --> 06:02.651
[ Woman]
And your name is .7
Alvin James.

06:02.738 --> 06:07.277
There.
His pitch elevates slightly,
suggesting that he’s lying.

06:07.368 --> 06:10.405
I’ve also isolated
some noise behind him.

06:10.496 --> 06:12.908
[Air Wrench Whining]

06:14.458 --> 06:16.449
What is that?

06:16.544 --> 06:18.705
It sounds like lug nuts
being removed...

06:18.796 --> 06:21.162
and... a tire being inflated.

06:21.257 --> 06:22.963
Gas station?

06:23.050 --> 06:25.462
Symchay Conteh,

06:25.553 --> 06:29.466
called in by an unknown
suspicious second party
from a gas station.

06:36.230 --> 06:39.222
I know it’s crazy, but
I’m already thinking
about lunch. So—

06:39.316 --> 06:42.683
Hey, uh, ifl didn’t already
know about Arastoo and Cam—

06:42.778 --> 06:44.769
You do not know.

06:44.863 --> 06:47.320
Only I know, at least
as far as Arastoo and Cam
are concerned.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.818
Oh, come on.
Look at them.

06:48.909 --> 06:51.821
She’s signing
a requisition.

06:54.415 --> 06:57.532
She’s gonna figure out that
I would’ve known if I didn’t have
to hide that I already knew.

06:57.626 --> 07:00.288
Okay, I’m gonna
run away now.

07:01.672 --> 07:04.709
I’m surprised
they have their clothes on.

07:05.593 --> 07:07.208
[ Man ]
Symchay’s a good kid.

07:07.303 --> 07:08.759
Friendly, quiet.

07:08.846 --> 07:10.552
How well
did you know him?

07:10.639 --> 07:13.016
| just started working here
three weeks ago.

07:13.100 --> 07:15.807
Mostly during the day
when he’s at work.

07:15.894 --> 07:17.930
But we are both
from Sierra Leone, so—

07:18.063 --> 07:20.099
When was the last time
you saw him?
Three days ago.

07:20.190 --> 07:22.181
l was fixing the light
down the hall.

07:22.276 --> 07:24.813
Roommate?
Girlfriends?
Symchay lives alone.

07:24.903 --> 07:28.270
The rest— Uh, girls?
l—l—l don’t know.

07:28.365 --> 07:30.697
Thank you.

07:33.162 --> 07:34.823
[ Booth ]
So what do you think?

07:34.913 --> 07:37.905
No photos of parents,
nothing of him as a kid.

07:38.000 --> 07:40.082
I mean, the youngest photo
of him is maybe 18.

07:40.169 --> 07:43.661
This is someone who is focused
on starting a new life.

07:43.756 --> 07:45.587
You notice there’s
no African stuff?

07:45.674 --> 07:48.290
Maybe he was just trying
to fit in to this country.

07:48.385 --> 07:52.344
Or... maybe he very much wanted
to leave his old
life behind.

07:52.431 --> 07:56.640
Looks like our guy Symchay
graduated from chef school
last May.

07:56.769 --> 07:59.476
Bed’s made,
but the couch isn’t.
Yeah.

07:59.563 --> 08:02.475
Right. So the maintenance guy
said the victim lived alone.

08:02.566 --> 08:04.477
Someone visiting?

08:04.568 --> 08:06.399
What is that, receipts?

08:06.487 --> 08:09.570
Look like duplication sheets
from a taxicab logbook.

08:11.075 --> 08:13.987
Whoever it was, there’s no other
sign that they were
ever here.

08:14.078 --> 08:17.912
Good Samaritan lets a cabbie
sleep on his couch, and
then he gets murdered for it?

08:23.712 --> 08:25.668
This is
what I signed on for?

08:25.756 --> 08:27.792
Yes.
An industrial dishwasher.

08:29.802 --> 08:32.919
You’re sending the remains
through a power rinse cycle?

08:33.013 --> 08:35.129
Basically, it’s covered
in soap, so, yeah.

08:35.224 --> 08:37.431
This isn’t gonna
wash away any evidence?

08:37.518 --> 08:39.429
The catch tray
will collect
the runoff...

08:39.520 --> 08:41.101
and any particulates.

08:42.523 --> 08:46.107
I’m sorry we didn’t
get our evening.

08:46.193 --> 08:48.275
Occupational hazard.

08:48.362 --> 08:50.569
At least
I was here with you.

08:52.908 --> 08:55.650
I know this is hard.

08:55.744 --> 08:59.202
Loving you is the easiest thing
in my life right now.

08:59.289 --> 09:01.075
I’d like to boast
to the world about it,

09:01.166 --> 09:02.906
but that’s just my ego.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.585
[ Saroyan ]
You were expecting this,
right?

09:07.673 --> 09:12.087
You can expect something
and still be knocked off
your feet when it happens.

09:17.641 --> 09:19.757
[ Arastoo ]
Clean as a whistle.

09:21.645 --> 09:25.058
[ Booth ] So what will
the State Department let you
tell us about Symchay Conteh?

09:25.149 --> 09:29.392
Symchay Conteh
escaped Sierra Leone to Guinea
about 10 years ago...

09:29.486 --> 09:31.147
and applied
for refugee status.

09:31.238 --> 09:34.696
He was 14 years old.
You mean his parents
applied for refugee status?

09:34.783 --> 09:36.694
No, he was an orphan
on his own.

09:36.785 --> 09:39.993
When he came to the States,
he applied for
and was granted asylum.

09:40.080 --> 09:44.039
Which means a 14—year—old boy
had reason to fear for his life
if he was sent home.

09:44.168 --> 09:46.375
It was after
the civil war.
The kid did all right.

09:46.462 --> 09:49.044
Five years later,
he was granted US. citizenship.

09:49.131 --> 09:51.838
- Never went back
to Sierra Leone?
— Sweets was saying...

09:51.925 --> 09:54.883
that he was doing everything
he could to go forward,
not back.

09:54.970 --> 09:56.585
Model citizen.
Worked steadily.

09:56.680 --> 09:59.797
I’d hate to think that
his past caught up with him
in some way.

09:59.892 --> 10:03.259
— Why do you say it like that?
— He had a lot of
temporary, part—time jobs,

10:03.353 --> 10:06.265
but one source of income
remained steady the whole time.

10:06.356 --> 10:08.267
Something to do
with Sierra Leone?

10:08.358 --> 10:11.350
Yeah, he was getting payments
from, uh, Wilford Hamilton
and Associates.

10:11.487 --> 10:14.729
Law firm or accountant?
Law firm specializing
in immigration.

10:14.823 --> 10:18.657
Why would an immigration lawyer
be paying the victim
instead of vice versa?

10:19.661 --> 10:21.117
Thanks, Alex.

No, it’s true, Booth.

when he applied for asylum.

11:38.448 --> 11:41.986
Then later I hired him
to help other refugees
get on their feet.

11:42.119 --> 11:45.111
How long ago
did Symchay die?
Three days.

11:45.205 --> 11:46.866
How did Symchay
help other refugees?

11:46.957 --> 11:49.414
Got them settled,
helped them find
a living situation,

11:49.501 --> 11:52.208
um, a job, et cetera.

11:52.296 --> 11:54.207
I didn’t pay him very much.

11:54.298 --> 11:56.209
The fact is, he would’ve
done it for free.

12:00.012 --> 12:02.424
No. No, no.
Everyone loved Symchay.

12:02.514 --> 12:04.971
Any signs of trouble
from his past?

12:05.809 --> 12:07.595
Wait a second.

12:07.686 --> 12:09.802
[ Drawer Opens]

12:13.025 --> 12:14.856
[ Exhales ]

12:15.819 --> 12:18.606
— Who’s this?
- Brima Chalobah.

12:18.697 --> 12:23.157
It’s a friend of Symchay’s
who was deported back
to Sierra Leone two years ago.

12:23.243 --> 12:25.450
If he was deported,
why is that
of interest to me?

12:25.537 --> 12:27.653
Because he’s back here
in the US. illegally.

12:27.748 --> 12:30.364
— How do you know?
— Because he came here.

12:30.459 --> 12:33.121
He asked Symchay for help,
but Symchay told him...

12:33.211 --> 12:35.122
that there was not a thing
we could do for him...

12:35.213 --> 12:36.874
as long as he was
in the country illegally.

12:36.965 --> 12:39.422
- And Symchay
didn’t tell the police?
— No.

12:39.509 --> 12:41.500
Neither of us did.

12:45.307 --> 12:47.593
People here have to
be able to trust us.

12:47.684 --> 12:51.142
Right. Well, that trust could
have gotten Symchay killed.

12:54.858 --> 12:56.689
This is my case, Alex.

12:56.777 --> 13:00.361
You got deportees,
illegal immigrants,
dead asylum refugees.

13:00.447 --> 13:02.529
That means State
oversees this case, Booth.

13:02.658 --> 13:04.569
And I’m State.
Right.

13:04.660 --> 13:08.528
So as an overseer,
what exactly do you do?
Can you just enlighten me?

13:08.622 --> 13:10.533
I tell you what to do.

13:10.624 --> 13:13.161
lexhon,andthen
you make me look good.

13:13.251 --> 13:14.866
Here’s Brima’s file.

13:14.962 --> 13:18.125
He was deported
for almost killing a man
in a street fight.

13:18.215 --> 13:22.003
This lawyer, Hamilton,
he’s sure Brima
is back in the States?

13:22.094 --> 13:26.007
Well, fingerprints confirm Brima
was the missing roommate
sleeping on Symchay’s couch.

13:26.098 --> 13:28.931
So he’s here illegally,
has a history of violence.

13:29.017 --> 13:30.632
Maybe they fight.

13:30.727 --> 13:33.719
Brima kills Symchay
and he takes off.
But the question is where?

13:33.814 --> 13:36.021
The Baltimore-D.C. area has
the largest population...

13:36.108 --> 13:37.894
of Sierra Leonean immigrants
in the US.

13:37.985 --> 13:40.146
And they protect each other
because they know
being sent back...

13:40.237 --> 13:42.102
is a lot worse
than prison here.

13:42.239 --> 13:45.481
No one’s gonna give him up.
Don’t worry, buddy.
You’ll get him.

13:45.575 --> 13:49.739
And I’ll give you
all the appropriate credit.
I’m not a small man.

13:51.081 --> 13:53.493
l tracked down the cab company
from the logbook pages...

13:53.583 --> 13:55.494
that Booth found
in the victim’s apartment.

13:55.585 --> 13:57.496
Did the victim
or the roommate
work there?

13:57.587 --> 14:01.205
Well, Brima is illegal,
so he probably didn’t want
to use his real name.

14:01.341 --> 14:04.458
And as we know,
the anonymous caller
who reported Symchay missing...

14:04.553 --> 14:06.760
seemed to be calling
from a garage.

14:06.847 --> 14:09.384
So you think it was
the taxi garage
and Brima was the caller?

14:09.474 --> 14:11.681
Yeah.
Booth thinks it’s possible.

14:11.810 --> 14:15.223
lf Brima killed Symchay,
why would he report himself?
I don’t know.

14:15.313 --> 14:18.555
That’s why I asked
for the dispatch recordings
from the cab company.

14:18.650 --> 14:20.766
I can compare them
to the 911 call,

14:20.861 --> 14:23.898
and then maybe we can find out
if Brima made the call.

14:23.989 --> 14:25.900
Okay.

14:26.658 --> 14:28.569
Mr. Vaziri.

14:28.660 --> 14:32.278
No remodeling, which means
these rib fractures occurred
close to time of death.

14:32.372 --> 14:36.081
But you haven’t found
any injuries severe enough
to give us cause of death?

14:36.168 --> 14:38.875
No injuries severe enough
for him to even notice.

14:38.962 --> 14:43.831
I disagree.
These broken ribs alone would
have been extremely painful.

14:43.925 --> 14:46.507
They aren’t anything
he wasn’t used to.

14:46.595 --> 14:50.634
l’ve cataloged
eight remodeled antemortem
injuries so far—

14:50.724 --> 14:52.931
a fractured tibia,

14:53.018 --> 14:56.681
clavicle, mandible,
all dating
back to his childhood.

14:56.772 --> 14:59.138
Life in Sierra Leone
wasn’t easy.

14:59.274 --> 15:01.390
There was a war.
Exactly.

15:01.485 --> 15:05.148
Bone deformation
in the vertebrae
and the knees and feet...

15:05.238 --> 15:07.229
from carrying heavy loads
barefoot.

15:07.324 --> 15:08.814
Yes.

15:08.909 --> 15:11.491
And the asymmetry
of the shoulderjoint—

15:11.578 --> 15:14.786
common
from repeated use
of AK—47’s.

15:14.873 --> 15:18.741
The butt of the gun
repeatedlyjamming
against the shoulder frame.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.998
I saw this
in Guatemala and Darfur.

15:22.089 --> 15:25.832
Symchay Conteh
wasn’t just a refugee
from Sierra Leone.

15:28.386 --> 15:31.173
He was a child soldier.

15:31.264 --> 15:33.380
A small boy taught to kill.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.851
Who’s the victim
in that case?

15:41.233 --> 15:44.191
When you were
growing up in Iran
during the war with Iraq—

15:44.277 --> 15:46.393
l was privileged,
sheltered.

15:46.488 --> 15:51.152
l dealt with power outages,
food shortages and propaganda.

15:51.243 --> 15:53.074
I had it easy.

15:53.161 --> 15:55.322
No one has it easy in war.

15:55.413 --> 15:57.074
I’m not the victim here,
Dr. Brennan.

15:57.165 --> 15:59.030
I’d like to focus
on Symchay.

16:08.051 --> 16:10.633
Symchay’s bank records show
that he received a check
for a thousand dollars...

16:10.720 --> 16:12.221
the day before he died.

16:12.305 --> 16:13.920
At a gallery?
Yeah.

16:14.015 --> 16:16.392
Some photo gallery
on, uh, U Street.

16:16.476 --> 16:20.435

Child soldiers
were controlled through food.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.387
lfthey didn’t kill,
they didn’t eat.

16:22.482 --> 16:25.394
Well, he came here
to start over,
and look what happened.

16:25.485 --> 16:28.602
Man. You know,
I really need a vacation.

16:28.697 --> 16:32.406
We’ll go.
I’ve been thinking... Paris.

16:32.492 --> 16:34.949
Paris? Yeah! All right!
Okay, now you’re talking.

16:35.036 --> 16:37.869
The catacombs are filled
with historical remains,

16:37.956 --> 16:40.493
and the sewer system
is fascinating.

16:40.584 --> 16:42.415
[ Chuckles ]
Right.

16:42.502 --> 16:44.493
Skeletons and poop.

16:44.588 --> 16:46.499
Well, way to
ruin Paris, Bones.

16:46.631 --> 16:49.373
Well, the food there
is superb.
I lost my appetite.

16:53.096 --> 16:56.338
So you hired Symchay through
the A.F.P. refugee center?
[Woman ] Yeah.

16:56.433 --> 17:00.176
And given my subject matter,
I wanted a West African chef
to cater the opening.

17:00.270 --> 17:02.101
He came
highly recommended.

17:02.189 --> 17:05.147
You took
all of these photographs?

17:05.233 --> 17:06.564
Yep.

17:06.651 --> 17:09.518
I covered the war
in Sierra Leone
for over three years.

17:09.613 --> 17:11.399
That couldn’t
have been easy.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.741
It wasn’t.

17:13.825 --> 17:16.737
It’s taken me 10 years
to exhibit these.

17:20.373 --> 17:22.864
to be a dispassionate
observer.

17:22.959 --> 17:24.745
It’s easier said than done.

17:24.836 --> 17:26.747
ltstough
in our line of work too.

17:26.838 --> 17:30.706
So, did you contact Symchay
personally, or was it
all done through e—mails?

17:30.800 --> 17:33.337
No, no. We met once,
uh, to go over the menu,

17:33.428 --> 17:36.761
so he could scout the location,
see what he needed to bring,
you know, stuff like that.

17:36.848 --> 17:39.009
Right. And that was what,
three days ago?

17:39.100 --> 17:42.433
- Yeah.
- The day he went missing.

17:42.520 --> 17:46.388
You know, when l was
showing him around,
I realized I’d made a mistake.

17:46.483 --> 17:47.973
[ Booth ]
I don’t understand.

17:48.068 --> 17:50.480
When he looked
at the photos,
he just broke down.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.061
He started crying.
He fell to his knees.

17:53.156 --> 17:55.272
| just... felt terrible.

17:55.367 --> 17:57.574
He didn’t know what he was
getting himself into?

17:57.661 --> 18:00.368
Yes. On the phone
he said he can handle it.

18:00.455 --> 18:03.242
He might have been able to
if he hadn’t seen this.

18:03.333 --> 18:06.951
— What’s that?
— Oh, that one’s
particularly heartbreaking.

18:07.045 --> 18:09.582
[Woman ]
I call that one “Initiation Day.”

18:09.673 --> 18:11.584
The shape of the skull,

18:11.675 --> 18:14.917
the anterior nasal spine,
the mandible.

18:15.011 --> 18:18.879
The child soldier
in this photograph is Symchay.

18:28.483 --> 18:31.646
So, do you keep
any potassium hydroxide
around here?

18:31.736 --> 18:34.648
Yeah. I use it to develop
my high-contrast photos.

18:34.739 --> 18:36.946
How much do you keep
on the premises?

18:37.033 --> 18:39.775
Maybe, I don’t know,
a pound.

18:39.869 --> 18:41.325
What’s going on?

18:41.413 --> 18:44.325
This is the last place
Symchay Conteh
was seen alive.

18:44.416 --> 18:49.160
His killer tried to
dissolve his dead body
in potassium hydroxide.

18:50.005 --> 18:51.541
You think / killed him?

18:51.631 --> 18:53.963
The photo you took of him,
that’s the centerpiece
of your show.

18:54.050 --> 18:58.965
But I didn’t know that.
People change between
the age of seven and 24.

18:59.055 --> 19:02.297
You know, I have seen
enough death, thanks.

19:02.392 --> 19:04.883
l have no interest
in killing anybody myself.

19:04.978 --> 19:08.141
Have you ever gotten
any help, Ms. Singer?

19:08.231 --> 19:11.394
I’m a veteran. I can recognize
post—traumatic stress disorder.

19:12.569 --> 19:14.230
Yes.

19:14.321 --> 19:15.857
I got help.

19:15.947 --> 19:18.029
I had trouble sleeping.

19:18.116 --> 19:19.652
I had dreams.

19:19.743 --> 19:22.200
I got depressed.

19:22.287 --> 19:25.779
But I have my work,
and I never killed anybody.

19:25.915 --> 19:29.248
Can you say
the same thing?
No,lcannot

19:35.967 --> 19:38.379
I may have found
cause of death.

19:40.555 --> 19:42.796
There’s a linear cut
on the right clavicle.

19:42.891 --> 19:46.679
And there is also fracturing
adjacent to the cut...

19:46.770 --> 19:49.637
along the right side
at one end.

19:49.731 --> 19:53.349
There’s similar fracturing
on the left side at
the opposing end of the cut.

19:53.485 --> 19:57.398
Indicative of
a stab—and—twist movement.
A bayonet.

19:57.489 --> 20:01.027
Both sides of the conflict
in Sierra Leone used bayonets.

20:01.117 --> 20:03.153
Have Dr. Hodgins swab the cut
for particulates...

20:03.244 --> 20:05.986
before we jump
to any conclusions.

20:06.081 --> 20:10.916
So, Kimberly’s coverage of
the war covered multiple years
in multiple zones.

20:11.002 --> 20:13.960
Suggests extraordinary access
on both sides of the conflict.

20:14.047 --> 20:16.709
Symchay Conteh
comes to the gallery...

20:16.800 --> 20:18.882
and is literally
confronted with his past,

20:18.968 --> 20:21.254
a past he’s tried
everything possible
to repress.

20:21.346 --> 20:24.338
Well, that explains
why he might attack her,
not vice versa.

20:24.432 --> 20:26.548
Unless... he knows
something about her.

20:26.643 --> 20:28.224
What about
the potassium hydroxide?

20:28.311 --> 20:30.222
Well, we checked out
her purchasing records,

20:30.313 --> 20:32.474
and she didn’t buy
enough of the stuff
to dissolve a body.

20:32.565 --> 20:35.477
I suspect when
you find your illegal alien,
you’ll find your killer.

20:35.568 --> 20:37.479
Oh, so, what?
Now you want to be
an FBI. agent?

I watch TV.
I can contribute.

20:40.782 --> 20:44.024

not to be an American, right?

Boom.

20:51.418 --> 20:53.784
Yeah. You remember
the Missing Persons call?

20:53.878 --> 20:55.834
Sure. Maybe came
from a garage?

20:55.922 --> 20:59.164
I compared it
to the dispatch calls
from the cab company, and—

That’s correct.

21:17.068 --> 21:19.730
I can’t tell
if it’s the same voice.

Well, our ears
might fool us,

21:21.823 --> 21:26.112
but the voices actually match
beyond what our ears can hear.

21:26.202 --> 21:28.784

is Brima?

21:28.872 --> 21:32.740

the cabdriver definitely
made the 911 call.

And, now, the cab
is registered to—

21:38.089 --> 21:40.125

21:40.216 --> 21:44.050
When I lived in New York,
there was a guy who
lived upstairs from me...

21:44.137 --> 21:46.048
who worked legally
for a cab company,

21:46.139 --> 21:48.881
but he would sometimes
let his roommate
drive the cab...

21:48.975 --> 21:50.761
so that it could run 24-7.

21:50.852 --> 21:53.889

22:42.070 --> 22:45.779
I called because
I had feared something
happened to Symchay.

22:45.865 --> 22:48.402
I don’t need to tell you
you’re in lot of trouble,
Mr. Chalobah.

22:48.493 --> 22:51.030
I did not hurt Symchay.
He was my friend.

22:51.120 --> 22:53.953
You’re in
this country illegally.
You got a criminal record.

22:54.040 --> 22:56.998
I did nothing then.
I was just standing there
when the fight started.

22:57.085 --> 22:58.791
What happened
to your hand?

23:00.630 --> 23:03.588
When I was a boy at school,

23:04.634 --> 23:07.341
I refused to kill my teacher,

23:07.428 --> 23:11.216
so the rebel soldiers
made me watch while they did.

23:11.307 --> 23:13.013
And then
they cut off your hand.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.717
The government slogan was,

23:15.812 --> 23:18.975
“The decision
is in your hands.”
So the rebels took your hand.

23:20.817 --> 23:23.274
- Bastards.
— Sorry, but you knew
about this?

23:23.361 --> 23:26.273
You think I could get
where I am at State
without being the best?

23:26.364 --> 23:29.731
I promise you, sir,
I did not kill Symchay.

23:29.826 --> 23:31.862
How could I with one hand?

23:31.953 --> 23:33.909
You’re a strong man.
You used to be a soldier.

23:33.997 --> 23:37.660
I can only imagine
the people you killed
with just one hand.

23:41.921 --> 23:44.708
Symchay was my friend.

23:46.259 --> 23:49.467
l was forced to kill,
but I am not a monster.

23:49.554 --> 23:52.421
Maybe Symchay
was gonna turn you in
for being illegal.

23:52.557 --> 23:55.549
He would never do that.
You know what? Maybe all
this was just an accident.

23:55.643 --> 23:58.976
Maybe seeing the photograph
for the first time just
triggered something in Symchay.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.770
He comes home
all bugged out,
you guys fight.

24:01.858 --> 24:03.564
You didn’t mean
to kill him.

24:03.651 --> 24:05.312
But that photo
was not new to him.

24:05.403 --> 24:08.236
It was published
in the Freetown Unite,
our community paper,

24:08.323 --> 24:09.779
five years ago.

24:09.866 --> 24:12.653
You’re positive
that Symchay
saw that photo?

24:12.744 --> 24:16.532
As part of a child soldier’s
rehabilitation, they have
to face what they’ve done.

24:18.291 --> 24:21.954
We were taught that
none of this is our fault,

24:22.045 --> 24:25.412
that first...
we must...

24:25.506 --> 24:28.168
learn to forgive ourselves.

24:28.885 --> 24:31.877
l— I tried.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.887
I really tried.

24:50.573 --> 24:52.609
I believe him.
I’d like to.

24:52.700 --> 24:55.942
But the kind of trauma
he suffered,
it never really goes away.

24:56.037 --> 24:57.652
It can manifest suddenly.

24:57.789 --> 25:00.280
He called the police. He was
concerned about his friend.
Yeah, remorse.

25:00.416 --> 25:04.159
Delayed onset P.T.S.D. can cause
violent outbursts brought on
by seemingly minor events.

25:04.253 --> 25:05.754
It’s called
hyperarousal.

25:05.838 --> 25:09.001
Now, after the event,
the person experiences
regret and self—hatred.

25:09.092 --> 25:11.504
Well, I hope he’s innocent,
’cause the last thing I want...

25:11.594 --> 25:14.461
is to be the son of a bitch
who sent him back to his death.

25:16.140 --> 25:18.096
[ Exhales ]

25:24.857 --> 25:27.064
Brima couldn’t have
killed Symchay.

25:27.151 --> 25:29.187
Well, the guy
looks pretty scary,

25:29.278 --> 25:31.985
and Booth said that
a soldier wouldn’t need
both hands, so—

25:32.073 --> 25:34.405
This one would.
Angela modeled the attack.

25:34.492 --> 25:36.403
Given the extent of
the victim’s injuries,
and Brima,

25:36.494 --> 25:39.281
and the victim’s height
and weight differentials,
he couldn’t have done it.

25:39.372 --> 25:42.159
If he had both hands, yes,
but as an amputee, no way.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.491
Have you figured out
what was used
to stab Symchay?

25:44.585 --> 25:46.450
Yes... and no,

25:46.546 --> 25:48.252
but mostly no.

25:48.339 --> 25:51.502
See, the results
from the swab indicate
a weapon made of steel.

25:51.592 --> 25:53.844
Medium—carbon steel—
that’s what they use
to make bayonets.

25:53.928 --> 25:58.262
But this isn’t medium—carbon.
lt’s chrome—plated and contains
traces of potassium chloride.

25:58.391 --> 26:00.302
I don’t understand.
Neither do |.

26:00.393 --> 26:02.224
I mean, potassium chloride?

26:02.311 --> 26:06.179
That’s a residue common
to an AK—47 after firing.

26:06.315 --> 26:08.897
And the steel and chrome plating
matches an AK?
Yep.

26:08.985 --> 26:11.317
This injury was made
by an AK—47.

26:11.404 --> 26:14.942
That makes no sense.
You can’t slice the clavicle
with the barrel of an AK—47.

26:15.032 --> 26:16.943
You made a mistake.
Test it again.

26:17.034 --> 26:20.526
I get that
you’re upset about this,
but I didn’t mess up here.

26:20.621 --> 26:23.488
— Do you have any idea
what this man went through?
- Yes, but—

26:23.583 --> 26:25.574
No, it wasn’t
an unhappy childhood.

26:25.710 --> 26:29.419
His problems weren’t getting
into the right preschool
and having the coolest sneakers.

26:29.505 --> 26:31.006
— | get that.
- It was hell!

26:31.090 --> 26:32.466
He grew up in hell,
Hodgins.

26:32.550 --> 26:34.757
Making mistakes
and giving up—
that can’t happen!

26:34.844 --> 26:37.256
Hey! I am not giving up.

26:37.346 --> 26:40.509
Now, I’m sorry that
you don’t like my results,
but I didn’t mess up here!

26:40.600 --> 26:43.512
Do you want the whole lab
hearing you? Because
that’s what’s happening.

26:43.603 --> 26:46.720
I do not need him coming in here
and accusing me...

26:46.814 --> 26:49.226
of being incompetent
and not caring.

26:49.317 --> 26:52.024
You’re the intern.
I’m the guy with “Doctor”
in front of his name.

26:52.111 --> 26:54.193
I had no idea
you were incapable
of making mistakes.

26:54.280 --> 26:56.646
Maybe I should
just bow down to you
and do whatever you say.

26:56.741 --> 26:58.402
Okay, that is enough.

26:58.493 --> 27:00.074
You go back to work,
Dr. Hodgins.

27:00.161 --> 27:02.322
Mr. Vaziri,
you come with me.

27:10.546 --> 27:12.127
What’s going on?

27:12.215 --> 27:13.876
I’m trying
to solve this case.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.797
And you feel you’re
the only one who can,

27:15.885 --> 27:18.592
by alienating
the most brilliant staff
in the country?

27:20.640 --> 27:23.723
l’ll apologize
and get back to work.
I didn’t say you could go.

27:23.810 --> 27:25.801
I’m also your boss.
Remember?

27:25.895 --> 27:27.431
I remember.

27:29.273 --> 27:31.264
What’s going on, Arastoo?

27:32.568 --> 27:35.275
You don’t sound
like my boss now.

27:36.280 --> 27:38.692
I want to help you.
Talk to me.

27:38.783 --> 27:41.741
Would you like everyone here
to see your concern?

27:41.828 --> 27:43.819
I don’t think so.

27:43.913 --> 27:46.029
This is work.
I’ll be a professional.

27:46.123 --> 27:49.456
I’m sorry for my behavior.
It was wrong,
and it won’t happen again.

27:49.544 --> 27:52.752
But I would really like
to get back to the bones.

28:12.483 --> 28:14.769
Woke up
and you weren’t there.

28:16.696 --> 28:18.561
I couldn’t sleep.

28:18.656 --> 28:20.192
What are those?

28:20.283 --> 28:24.526
Some pictures I took
in Central America and Darfur.

28:24.620 --> 28:27.657
It was impossible
to identify all of them.

28:29.000 --> 28:30.865
And these soldiers?

28:32.211 --> 28:34.418
They were helping us.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.372
l was grateful at the time,
but look at them.

28:37.466 --> 28:41.300
I mean, look at him, Booth.
He couldn’t be more than 15.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.842
I thanked him.

28:46.017 --> 28:48.008
Well, you had a job to do.

28:49.145 --> 28:51.511
In Afghanistan,
when you see boys like this,

28:51.606 --> 28:53.642
do you let them fight?

28:55.401 --> 28:58.234
It was different.
There was a protocol.

28:58.321 --> 29:00.733
I should have made sure...

29:00.823 --> 29:05.362
that he could
put down that gun
and have a normal life.

29:05.453 --> 29:09.116
Well, what’s normal
in a war zone,
Bones, really?

29:10.708 --> 29:12.289
Well, not this.

29:12.376 --> 29:16.415
We can never let this be normal,
even if they’re on our side.

29:16.505 --> 29:20.089

Is everything okay?

You tell me.
Why are you up?

29:23.346 --> 29:26.713
Probably the same reason
you are— the case.

29:27.683 --> 29:30.015
There’s still
no helpful evidence?

29:30.102 --> 29:33.344
Well, Hodgins found a gun
that’s somehow supposed
to be used as a knife,

29:33.439 --> 29:35.350
but it doesn’t
trace back to anyone.

29:35.441 --> 29:37.648
We’ll go over
the remains again,

29:37.735 --> 29:41.193
but so far
we have nothing of value.

29:41.280 --> 29:44.943
All we’re sure of is that
there was an inciting incident
at the gallery...

29:45.034 --> 29:46.490
that set off Symchay.

29:46.577 --> 29:48.989
But he’s the only one who knows
what upset him that day,

29:49.080 --> 29:50.991
and he’s not alive to tell us.

29:51.082 --> 29:52.697
Maybe his friend does.

29:52.792 --> 29:55.499
— Brima?
— We know that Brima
didn’t kill him,

29:55.586 --> 29:58.043
and he was telling the truth
about being Symchay’s friend.

29:58.130 --> 30:01.964
Yeah. They did go to
rehabilitation together after
they escaped from Sierra Leone.

30:02.051 --> 30:04.838
I mean,
part of that process
is baring all.

30:04.929 --> 30:09.013
So you think that maybe he can
tell us what upset Symchay
that day at the gallery?

35:05.437 --> 35:08.645
— Do they match?
- It might not sound the same
initially, but yes.

35:08.732 --> 35:10.313
Completely.

35:10.401 --> 35:12.983
The man you have in custody
is definitely Joseph Mbarga.

35:13.070 --> 35:14.981
So that’s why
you questioned him.

35:15.072 --> 35:17.609
You didn’t care
what he had to say,
so long as he said something.

35:17.700 --> 35:20.942
I’m not gonna let this guy
back in the world ifl have
anything to say about it.

35:21.036 --> 35:23.448
You are wasted
in the F.B.l., Booth.

35:23.539 --> 35:26.531
Why don’t you come work
at the State Department?
I could hook that up.

35:42.766 --> 35:47.055
So, the man we have in custody
is definitely Joseph Mbarga.

35:47.146 --> 35:50.638
Well, I haven’t proved
that he is the one
who killed Symchay.

35:50.733 --> 35:53.770
Doesn’t matter anymore.
I got him on at least
a thousand other murders.

35:53.861 --> 35:55.647
Well, I’m investigating
this murder.

35:55.738 --> 35:57.603
— And I found something.
— What?

35:57.698 --> 36:00.906
A second stab wound
on the victim’s atlas
on the inside.

36:01.035 --> 36:03.071
He was stabbed twice?
Yes.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.404
With two weapons—
very similar,
but not identical.

36:06.498 --> 36:07.999
Oh, like a double prong?

36:08.083 --> 36:09.789
That would make
the most sense.

36:09.877 --> 36:14.997
A two—pronged weapon
made of chrome—plated steel
matching an AK—47.

36:15.090 --> 36:19.083
According to the Book of Isaiah,
“They shall beat their swords
into plowshares.”

36:19.178 --> 36:23.217
Yes.
It means to turn weapons
to peaceful uses.

36:23.307 --> 36:25.218
Maybe that actually
happened,okay?

36:25.309 --> 36:28.597
Maybe he turned his AK—47
into a pitchfork.

36:30.439 --> 36:32.179
Not a pitchfork, Booth.

36:32.274 --> 36:33.889
An African tribal mask.

36:34.026 --> 36:37.189
You sound really
confident about that.
I am. I saw the mask.

36:37.279 --> 36:40.021
— You saw the mask?
— Just heard from
our friend at State.

36:40.115 --> 36:43.858
Guess who Joseph Mbarga,
a.k.a. Tony Dennis, used
as an immigration lawyer?

36:43.952 --> 36:45.203
Wilford Hamilton.

36:45.287 --> 36:48.700
The clinic here
uses potassium hydroxide
as a cleaner.

36:48.791 --> 36:51.248
There’s more than enough
to fill the barrel.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.075
All right,
this guy’s going down.

36:56.215 --> 36:57.921
There it is.
What the hell
is going on?

36:58.008 --> 37:00.624
Wilford Hamilton,
you’re under arrest for
the murder of Symchay Conteh.

37:00.719 --> 37:03.927
— You gonna profess
your innocence now?
— I am innocent.

37:04.014 --> 37:06.756
Booth, there’s blood
on the horns...

37:06.850 --> 37:09.057
as well as the hanging wire
on the back.

37:09.144 --> 37:11.977
Did you cut your little finger
on the back of the wire there?
That is sloppy.

37:12.106 --> 37:14.097
Yeah, a month ago
when I hung the mask.
Really?

37:14.191 --> 37:16.102
Reflective
infrared spectroscopy
will show...

37:16.193 --> 37:19.105
that your blood stain
and Symchay’s
happened concurrently.

37:19.196 --> 37:22.563
Symchay came to you
and told you that his janitor
was Joseph Mbarga.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.398
— He trusted you.
- You killed him...

37:24.493 --> 37:27.109
because you didn’t
want to be exposed for
shielding a war criminal.

37:27.204 --> 37:28.819
What’s your
next play now?

37:28.914 --> 37:32.657
You gonna say taking money
from one big bad like Mbarga
is worth the price...

37:32.751 --> 37:34.833
because it kept
the refugee center open?

37:34.920 --> 37:37.161
You’re wrong, you bastard.
You’re dead wrong!

37:37.297 --> 37:40.084
Just relax.
We got him. Okay?
Hey, I’m not a cop, Booth.

37:40.175 --> 37:42.166
I hope you
get killed in jail.

37:42.261 --> 37:45.674
- I agree with Mr. Radziwill.
— I don’t. I want to see him
go through the whole system.

37:47.141 --> 37:49.177
[Woman ]
What did he just say?

37:49.309 --> 37:51.391
[Woman #2 ]
What is happening?
[Man ] What is he saying?

37:54.523 --> 37:57.356
What language do most
of these people speak?

37:57.443 --> 37:58.853
English.

37:58.944 --> 38:00.480
[ Brennan ]
English is the official
language, yes,

38:00.571 --> 38:03.529
but Krio actually is
the de facto national language.

38:03.615 --> 38:05.321
- Why?
- They’re scared.

38:05.451 --> 38:09.865
They’re refugees who
are seeing the guy they thought
was helping them being arrested.

38:09.955 --> 38:11.991
That man
was arrested...

38:12.082 --> 38:13.993
not because
he was helping you.

38:14.084 --> 38:16.666
He was arrested
because he betrayed you.

38:16.753 --> 38:19.961
This man—
[Speaking Krio]

38:20.048 --> 38:21.788
...name Alex Radziwill—

38:21.884 --> 38:24.216
[ Krio ]
...American government.

38:24.303 --> 38:26.510
[ Krio]

38:26.597 --> 38:28.053
...one by one.

38:28.140 --> 38:29.755
[Murmuring, Laughing]

38:29.850 --> 38:31.841
What she said.
Was that Krio?

38:31.935 --> 38:33.846
What did you say about me?

38:33.937 --> 38:35.768
[Chattering ]
Thank you.
Thank you.

38:35.898 --> 38:38.310
What did you
promise them?
Thank you, thank you.

38:38.400 --> 38:41.312
Oh, my God.
What did you say?

38:41.403 --> 38:43.234
[Chattering, Laughing ]

38:51.371 --> 38:52.986
You done?

38:53.081 --> 38:55.037
Just about.

38:55.125 --> 38:57.081
I need to explain
something to you.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.911
Okay.

39:01.882 --> 39:05.591
l have some experience
with child soldiers
from the other side.

39:08.347 --> 39:11.430
There were 96,000
child soldiers during
that first Persian Gulf War.

39:12.643 --> 39:14.599
You said that
you were privileged.

39:14.686 --> 39:16.517
l was.

39:16.605 --> 39:18.846
But there were others.

39:18.941 --> 39:20.647
My cousin.

39:20.734 --> 39:22.816
You don’t have
to tell me.

39:22.903 --> 39:24.939
I want to.

39:28.116 --> 39:30.823
My cousin was taken away.

39:33.705 --> 39:35.320
I saw it.

39:36.625 --> 39:39.116
I could do nothing.

39:40.045 --> 39:42.252
You were just
a child yourself.

39:46.635 --> 39:48.421
Farid died.

39:53.267 --> 39:55.428
We’re at work.

39:56.228 --> 39:57.718
Never mind.

40:00.065 --> 40:01.771
Someone will see us.

40:08.490 --> 40:10.856
That boat just sailed,
Arastoo.

40:10.993 --> 40:14.952
Okay, now | most definitely
would have figured this out.
[ Chuckles ]

40:15.038 --> 40:18.781
Why are Cam
and Arastoo
embracing?

40:22.963 --> 40:25.796
— Arastoo and l, we, uh—
— [Angela Chuckling]

40:25.882 --> 40:27.338
[ Saroyan Clears Throat]

40:27.426 --> 40:29.758
Um, when I’m at work,

40:29.845 --> 40:31.756
I will call this woman
Dr. Saroyan...

40:31.847 --> 40:34.759
and she will call me Mr. Vaziri,
but when we’re not at work—

40:34.850 --> 40:38.468
— When we’re not at work—
- Why does it matter
what you call each other?

40:38.562 --> 40:40.644
Exactly.

40:42.024 --> 40:44.731
[Whispering ]

40:44.818 --> 40:47.275
Oh— Oh.
Okay. H see.

40:47.362 --> 40:48.863
Uh, it’s symbolic.

40:48.947 --> 40:52.314
[Laughs]
As all nomenclature is
at its core.

40:52.409 --> 40:55.321
You will not see any evidence
that Cam and l
are more than colleagues.

40:55.412 --> 40:58.825
- Are we supposed to
clap or something?
— No, Dr. Hodgins.

40:58.915 --> 41:02.203
— Because we’re at work.
— Really, Dr. Hodgins,

41:02.294 --> 41:05.627
you need to learn
how to pick up on the more
subtle social indicators.

41:05.714 --> 41:07.454
Yes. Yes.

41:07.549 --> 41:09.540
lguess
I’m just a romantic.

41:10.177 --> 41:11.713
Yeah!

41:11.803 --> 41:14.135
Yay!
[ Laughing ]

41:14.222 --> 41:15.598
All right!

41:15.682 --> 41:18.219
[ Laughing ]
Proud of you.

41:18.310 --> 41:22.053
Yay! Whoo!
Good—looking couple.

41:22.147 --> 41:24.229
Where you going?
Babe?

41:28.320 --> 41:33.360
It’s very strange that I didn’t
notice that Cam and my intern
were romantically involved.

41:33.450 --> 41:35.441
Do I have to fire
Mr. Vaziri?

41:35.535 --> 41:37.196
No, no, that’s not—

41:37.329 --> 41:38.865
What’s that?
Oh.

41:38.955 --> 41:40.661
I had a brilliant idea.

41:40.791 --> 41:42.782
You always have
a brilliant idea.
Thank you.

41:42.918 --> 41:45.830
This is about our vacation.
Oh, great.
Our vacation.

41:45.921 --> 41:47.877
Look at this.
We’re going to...

41:48.590 --> 41:50.091
“Toe—Chew”?
Tho Chu.

41:50.217 --> 41:53.050
Tho Chu.
The Gulf of Thailand?
Oh, boy.

41:53.136 --> 41:58.506
Tho Chu has been contested
territory between Cambodia
and Vietnam for centuries.

41:58.600 --> 42:02.969
A lot of battles, massacres,
mass graves,

42:03.063 --> 42:04.974
history, fascinating adventure.

42:05.065 --> 42:06.646
You like adventure, right?

42:06.733 --> 42:08.519
Sounds fascinating.

42:08.610 --> 42:10.896
— Are you just saying that
to humor me?
— No.

42:10.987 --> 42:13.478
You know what?
If you’re happy, I’m happy.
It’s our vacation.

42:13.615 --> 42:15.230
There’s sailing—
Samng?

42:15.325 --> 42:17.316
and scuba diving
and fishing.

42:17.452 --> 42:18.908
Fishing?
And—

42:18.995 --> 42:21.327
Look at that.
Hey, is that a beach?

42:21.415 --> 42:22.871
Yes. With a bar.

42:22.958 --> 42:24.869
Thelocaldnnk
is called the ma hoi

42:24.960 --> 42:26.916
and it is not monitored
by any health agency.

42:27.045 --> 42:28.546
“Bia hai”?
B/a hoi.

42:28.630 --> 42:30.040
“Toe—choe.”
That’s what it is.

42:30.173 --> 42:31.674
Tho Chu.
You found paradise.

42:31.758 --> 42:33.464
Yes, paradise—

42:33.552 --> 42:35.838
mass graves for me
and a beach
with liquor for you.

42:35.971 --> 42:38.838
Right.
Is there room service?
Well, I don’t know.

42:38.932 --> 42:41.639
What’s this?
Oh, look, there’s a dock.

43:15.260 --> 43:16.670
What’s that mean?
