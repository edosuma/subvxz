01:03.833 --> 01:04.750
Vogel!

01:05.958 --> 01:07.041
- (Vogel)! Yes

01:22.875 --> 01:24.833
I have no name but Anna Vogel

01:25.833 --> 01:27.416
Never take off the shoe

01:27.750 --> 01:29.875
Do not take off any jewelry while...

01:30.708 --> 01:31.375
Madam...

01:32.000 --> 01:33.166
Headgear is forbidden

01:41.958 --> 01:44.958

- Hello - (Sean)

01:57.125 --> 01:58.458
You, touch is forbidden!

02:07.125 --> 02:07.958
I am glad to see you

02:08.500 --> 02:10.166
I came to see you off, Shawnee.

02:24.833 --> 02:26.583
Do not let the past dominate you

02:31.166 --> 02:32.541
Attach yourself, Sean.

- "Entering money and electronic devices
..." The killers are the best prisoners

02:54.333 --> 02:57.500
- “Exposes you to arrest, accountability, and denial
of visits” - They are smarter and they behave better

03:01.541 --> 03:02.625
What about thieves?

03:03.083 --> 03:04.625
"Entering cash and electronic devices exposes you
to arrest, accountability and denial of visits."

03:04.666 --> 03:06.458
The traditional thief is the worst

03:07.750 --> 03:08.958
He refuses to listen

03:09.500 --> 03:12.416
He also refuses to work while
he does not respect the laws

03:13.333 --> 03:14.500
And when they leave?

03:15.291 --> 03:18.916
I read somewhere that 87
percent of them go back to prison

03:19.791 --> 03:22.416
Indeed, the solution is to reintegrate them

03:22.625 --> 03:26.208
The best way to stay out
of prison is to find a good job

03:27.625 --> 03:30.333
It doesn't make sense to be so hard,
right?

03:30.500 --> 03:31.625
It is almost impossible

03:35.958 --> 03:36.791
Hassan

03:37.166 --> 03:38.500
Thank you, sir. Thank you

03:38.500 --> 03:39.375
take care of yourself

03:42.541 --> 03:43.250
How is he doing?

05:08.750 --> 05:10.666
Thank you so much, thank you

05:12.333 --> 05:14.291
- Frank, condolences.
- I'm glad you came

05:14.375 --> 05:17.166
I will be fine,
I will be fine Thank you

05:18.625 --> 05:19.291
Thank you

05:22.125 --> 05:22.625

05:23.500 --> 05:24.166

"I wished you could come..."

06:40.750 --> 06:43.750
"Do a dream I made."

06:44.666 --> 06:47.750
But you made enough to ride the wave.

- "What do you want to do?"
- "Alabama Correctional Institution"

07:30.208 --> 07:32.875
I wish you had spoken to me.

07:34.291 --> 07:37.083
I found another way to live.

07:38.458 --> 07:41.666
"Difficult living doesn't seem like a good thing."

07:42.291 --> 07:45.458
"Very difficult to get out of the woods."

08:20.416 --> 08:22.500
You can exchange your clothes in the room (C1)

good luck

“Alabama Correctional Institution” - No,
son

08:29.791 --> 08:30.916
Make him sign here

08:31.875 --> 08:32.791
Here

08:38.666 --> 08:39.625
Open the gate!

08:48.750 --> 08:49.333

08:50.708 --> 08:51.583
Nobody matters

08:53.791 --> 08:54.541
good morning

08:55.500 --> 08:58.083
Listen, I brought some local cakes

08:58.500 --> 09:00.875
This is some of your old clothes

09:07.541 --> 09:09.208
You could have said,
"I don't want to, thank you."

09:09.500 --> 09:10.708
What are you doing here, Frank?

09:10.916 --> 09:11.791
I came to take you

09:12.125 --> 09:12.833
no thanks

09:13.541 --> 09:14.625
- Listen... - Sir!

09:14.958 --> 09:15.625
I am his father

09:16.333 --> 09:18.166
- Want to go with
your father? No

09:18.500 --> 09:19.791
You can't force him if he doesn't want to

09:20.083 --> 09:20.875
Excuse us

09:21.541 --> 09:24.125
This is for your mother. We
have to do something for her

09:25.958 --> 09:26.708
what do you want?

09:27.541 --> 09:28.958
When she approaches her death...

09:29.958 --> 09:34.583
I made her promise that you and I would go
together on a trip to spread her ashes on a lake

09:35.458 --> 09:37.583
- Which lake? Lake
(Alan) in the east

09:37.750 --> 09:38.791
In the east, why?

09:38.958 --> 09:40.166
- Good... - Where?

09:40.458 --> 09:44.083
New York)? Massachusetts? No,
no, in the far east

09:45.750 --> 09:47.541
In the far east, man...

09:49.125 --> 09:51.000
Why would my mother want to
be buried in Ireland originally?

09:51.083 --> 09:53.291
I don’t know,
she was dying and she was breathing

09:53.333 --> 09:55.208
Some things are not to be
called into question, they just do

09:55.333 --> 09:57.791
No, you're not the only one who doubts and does

09:57.916 --> 10:01.083
Listen, if we do this you will
never have to see me again

10:02.708 --> 10:06.125
I will not go anywhere with you I
must be in California after 5 days

10:06.625 --> 10:07.791
There is a lot of time

10:08.041 --> 10:10.666
It will take us only 8 hours to
drive to the lake for a few hours

10:10.791 --> 10:12.250
And that is all in the wrong direction

10:12.916 --> 10:15.625
Isn't flying one of your concerns?

10:15.791 --> 10:17.500
See!  We both make sacrifices

10:17.666 --> 10:19.875
I have carefully planned this.
It will take 3 and a half days

10:20.041 --> 10:22.583
After that, I will pay you the price of
the plane ticket wherever you want to go

10:23.000 --> 10:24.375
Not interested, do it yourself

10:24.500 --> 10:26.000
No, no, we have to go together

10:26.125 --> 10:27.458
Had a very plate on it

10:27.666 --> 10:30.750
Look, while we're there, we can
take a look at the house you left for me

10:31.416 --> 10:33.791
which house? An old family
home that you inherited

10:33.958 --> 10:35.500
- How much is it? I do not know

10:35.666 --> 10:38.375
I didn't even know she had it,
but if you came with me

10:38.625 --> 10:40.166
Whatever it is, it will become yours

10:40.250 --> 10:41.875
Looks like a good deal, Vogel.

10:42.416 --> 10:43.625
Then you go

10:45.875 --> 10:46.958
Wait, Shawn!

10:49.666 --> 10:50.666
(Sh...), (Sean)

10:51.708 --> 10:53.416
That was her last wish

10:53.708 --> 10:54.500
I promised her

10:54.666 --> 10:57.625
You shouldn't make promises
that you can't keep, Frank.

10:59.083 --> 11:01.416
- Wait, Sean...
- Good sir, you have to back off

11:21.541 --> 11:24.916
Last 3 years as a tourist bus
driver you are more than qualified

11:25.083 --> 11:27.041
I only need someone to
drive a car to Los Angeles.

11:27.208 --> 11:29.333
I can't wait to start working

11:29.583 --> 11:32.750
Most people want a return card,
why don't you want it?

11:32.958 --> 11:37.416
I'm actually planning to move
to the West Coast for a job, so...

11:38.416 --> 11:39.833
This is in everyone's interest, then

11:39.958 --> 11:41.666
I need a reference or two

11:42.458 --> 11:43.500
Yes, yes, definitely

11:43.833 --> 11:44.875
Of course...

11:47.916 --> 11:51.375
Yes, I have their phone number here then

11:51.791 --> 11:54.000
If you have any other question

11:57.000 --> 11:58.375
Great, great

11:59.958 --> 12:01.541
How about a local?

12:02.000 --> 12:03.416
From (Evansville) for example

12:03.750 --> 12:05.666
Yeah, yeah, sure, you know...

12:06.083 --> 12:07.500
In fact, a few names...

12:07.708 --> 12:12.125
I got a few names,
but I think they are out of town right now

12:13.500 --> 12:14.708
Where are you son?

12:17.083 --> 12:19.541
I think one of them is on vacation, the other...

12:20.333 --> 12:22.500
No, no, no, but you?

12:22.958 --> 12:23.916
Look, I have to...

12:26.625 --> 12:28.875
I really have to be in
California by Monday

12:29.208 --> 12:31.333
Limestone or Decatur?

12:33.291 --> 12:34.208
Limestone.

12:35.791 --> 12:36.875
What do you care?

12:38.666 --> 12:43.875
Listen, what do you think about giving me the price of fuel
only, and forget about the daily meal and overnight expenses

12:46.416 --> 12:48.958
I can make one call and find out

12:52.666 --> 12:53.500
car theft

12:58.666 --> 13:01.250
Check out the all-new car with
seven passengers on the 2018 model.

13:16.833 --> 13:20.375
(Modine Motors) for selling
used cars 2052316200

14:00.958 --> 14:03.291
I have 5 days to go to Auckland.

14:04.250 --> 14:06.458
We should act immediately

14:19.458 --> 14:20.916
- "Fresh coffee, tour of the (United
States)" - When is my return date?

14:21.166 --> 14:23.000
Sunday morning at 10 and 50 minutes

14:26.416 --> 14:27.500
Damn! What?

14:28.333 --> 14:30.041
I told them not to add anything

14:30.041 --> 14:30.750
Give it back to them

14:31.625 --> 14:32.625
There is nothing wrong

14:33.458 --> 14:34.333
There is quite a bit

14:35.000 --> 14:36.000
It is not what I asked for

14:36.208 --> 14:37.125
Here she is!

14:38.125 --> 14:39.166
Now it is

14:40.833 --> 14:44.625
Do you know? Have some courage,
go and tell the teenager behind the counter

14:44.625 --> 14:45.791
"You have spoiled my order"

14:47.208 --> 14:50.541
- If I had spoken to my
father this way - your father...

14:50.625 --> 14:52.791
He was drunk enough to understand

14:53.583 --> 14:55.833
Let's just enjoy
our meal. Right!

14:57.583 --> 14:58.416
You can say it

14:59.250 --> 15:01.166
You can do that.
That guy was a villain

15:01.333 --> 15:02.500
We agreed?  He was despicable

15:03.083 --> 15:04.250
My father was

15:05.166 --> 15:06.291
And I respect him

15:07.041 --> 15:10.250
You must gain respect.
You have disagreed

15:11.708 --> 15:13.708
Do you respect me because I am your son?

15:14.208 --> 15:16.500
Can't we just enjoy our meal?

15:17.041 --> 15:18.083
you do not respect me

15:18.791 --> 15:20.791
Right, why don't you admit things?

15:21.541 --> 15:23.583
It's not like that would ruin our relationship, Frank.

15:24.333 --> 15:27.166
I did my best under
the circumstances

15:27.500 --> 15:29.041
Sometimes it is predominant

15:29.583 --> 15:31.041
Sometimes it is the knock

15:31.166 --> 15:32.083
This is life

15:32.541 --> 15:34.375
Dust off and move on

15:35.333 --> 15:36.541
I went ahead

15:41.625 --> 15:44.416
Do you know what is said? The
boy is bound to become like his father

15:45.458 --> 15:48.208
- I don't think it will ever happen - Yes,
but if it does...

15:52.875 --> 15:54.375
Here we are, first

15:55.750 --> 15:59.416
We are about to hang 30,000
feet above the ocean in a tin can

15:59.625 --> 16:02.750
It is driven by someone who
is not likely to get enough sleep

16:03.291 --> 16:05.291
Listen, you can withdraw at any time

16:05.416 --> 16:07.333
- And change my ticket to (Auckland) - No,
I'll be fine

16:07.458 --> 16:09.416
I hope we can watch a movie

16:37.083 --> 16:39.791
Platform 1

16:45.250 --> 16:45.625
Aves.

16:45.708 --> 16:48.375
Four doors, air conditioning
and manual transmission...

16:48.833 --> 16:51.208
Excuse me, madam,
are all cars automatic?

16:51.375 --> 16:52.375
I cannot drive with a manual conveyor

16:52.416 --> 16:54.916
No, this is a special request here

16:55.291 --> 16:58.041
We do not currently have any
automatic cars in your vehicle category

16:58.375 --> 17:00.750
- You will have to hire a higher category -
OK, we'll take the same manual conveyor

17:01.041 --> 17:03.416
- I'll take the lead - we'll
take a car of a higher class

17:04.083 --> 17:06.915
Do you want to make the fuel choice
so you don't have to fill up your tank?

17:07.165 --> 17:09.083
No, we will stop every hour so...

17:09.500 --> 17:11.125
I will cut our long journey in stages

17:11.540 --> 17:14.208
This is the stupidest thing I've ever
heard, it will take us twice as long

17:14.333 --> 17:16.790
It will take us longer to run out of fuel

17:17.790 --> 17:19.790
Aves.

17:31.708 --> 17:33.833
That was a little
obvious. Don't you think?

17:34.250 --> 17:36.541
What? The way
you stare at her chest

17:36.833 --> 17:37.750
I did not stare

17:38.958 --> 17:41.458
Having some respect in the
women's section won't hurt you

17:41.541 --> 17:43.416
women section!  where is he?

17:43.541 --> 17:46.250
Is he next to the household
items? Is it in the seventh corridor?

17:46.375 --> 17:48.958
You have to show respect to be respected

17:49.250 --> 17:52.291
I should know I spent
my life working in sales

17:52.666 --> 17:55.083
You're about to give me advice
on dealing with women, aren't you?

17:55.375 --> 17:58.125
Open the door for them and give them your jacket

17:58.875 --> 18:00.250
I carry their bag for them

18:00.500 --> 18:03.625
You have to keep this in mind
when you sell stolen cars in California.

18:05.333 --> 18:06.375
What do you do?

18:08.333 --> 18:09.625
Okay, step aside

18:11.083 --> 18:12.500
See what you did now!

18:19.208 --> 18:20.125
In any case

18:20.416 --> 18:24.208
For your information only...
this is not the way to win hearts

18:24.375 --> 18:28.041
I will have no problem winning hearts

18:28.958 --> 18:30.333
thank you very much

18:31.708 --> 18:34.708
I look forward to the time when
you will teach me about relationships

18:35.291 --> 18:38.625
Yes, now that we are past the sales lady

18:39.000 --> 18:41.500
It looks like we'll get to that house...

18:42.750 --> 18:44.666
- By tonight! - Tomorrow

18:45.416 --> 18:47.500
Tonight,
we have to stop in Dublin for that thing

18:47.666 --> 18:49.791
Thing? Anything? - That dinner

18:50.000 --> 18:51.750
For the sake of your mother with some of her relatives

18:51.958 --> 18:53.916
Damn it!  I don't even know these people

18:54.250 --> 18:55.083
We have to

18:55.208 --> 18:58.208
They could not come to the
funeral and wanted to meet here

19:01.250 --> 19:04.708
Who's the damn genius who told
them about our coming to Ireland?

19:14.625 --> 19:18.833
"Wayne's Hotel"

19:26.875 --> 19:27.541
What is wrong?

19:28.541 --> 19:29.541
I prefer modesty

19:30.500 --> 19:31.458
Do you mind that?

19:32.541 --> 19:34.083
Your suits are in the bag

19:37.708 --> 19:39.458
No, I will not wear this

19:40.291 --> 19:42.375
I was in high school and
was not even accepted then

19:42.583 --> 19:44.208
Well, wear what you like

19:52.708 --> 19:53.875
Prepare yourself here

19:54.250 --> 19:56.958
No, I don't think I saw
you one day without clothes

19:59.958 --> 20:02.416
Why are there two buttons on this toilet?

20:02.583 --> 20:05.291
I don’t know, this is my first visit to this country

20:14.333 --> 20:16.375
I got it,
the big button for need number two

20:17.333 --> 20:18.500
Hassan

20:20.500 --> 20:23.375
So, we stumbled upon our exit from the intensity of our drunkenness

20:23.625 --> 20:26.041
We could barely go to the next bar

20:26.041 --> 20:29.000
20 years have passed and I am still
suffering from the effects of drunkenness

20:29.833 --> 20:32.833
Do you know?  We were in the 1940's

20:39.375 --> 20:40.666
I don't think I've heard this story before

20:41.416 --> 20:44.500
She was one of the nicest
students I have ever studied

20:45.250 --> 20:47.583
She always played
with eccentric children

20:47.708 --> 20:50.833
Or have lunch with the untouchables

20:51.708 --> 20:55.250
She was very sympathetic
to the Lamentmene in life

20:56.208 --> 20:57.166
Frank!

20:58.041 --> 20:58.708
Yes

21:00.625 --> 21:02.500
Frank, Frank...

21:06.208 --> 21:06.833
Thank you

21:10.958 --> 21:13.416
Excuse me please, I have to...

21:13.958 --> 21:15.750
I have to take care of something

21:16.625 --> 21:17.875
(Frank)

21:49.625 --> 21:50.791
What beautiful!

21:52.708 --> 21:55.500
You were not the first to
leave the party early, right?

21:57.375 --> 21:59.583
We didn't really go to many parties together

22:00.875 --> 22:03.916
I must have made the same
old jokes every time I meet her

22:04.041 --> 22:06.333
And she always laughed
as though it was the first time

22:07.916 --> 22:11.625
Isn't it a coincidence that you know
this who is with her at the motor bike?

22:14.958 --> 22:15.958
I have no idea

22:17.500 --> 22:19.083
Not one of those here, I think

22:21.291 --> 22:24.833
Just another fan of the distant past,
I suppose

22:33.208 --> 22:34.333
Your health

22:40.333 --> 22:42.083
Come on!  Come on!  Come on!

22:42.291 --> 22:43.833
Come on!  Come on!  Come on!

22:43.958 --> 22:45.083
Come on!  Come on!  Come on!

22:45.250 --> 22:47.625
Come on! Come on! Come on! Yes!

22:51.000 --> 22:51.666
The next cup, man?

23:08.666 --> 23:11.791
the guard"

23:12.083 --> 23:13.208
Going to the bathroom

23:13.500 --> 23:15.125
He is human like us in the end

23:33.958 --> 23:35.708
I cannot identify him

23:35.958 --> 23:37.250
Look who I found...

23:37.833 --> 23:39.125
Glued to the bar

23:39.708 --> 23:41.375
The prodigal son!

23:42.166 --> 23:45.541
I haven't seen you since I was small

23:45.708 --> 23:47.500
Before you get lost

23:47.958 --> 23:48.916
(Kathleen)...

23:49.208 --> 23:51.500
Who is this raging young man?  Do you remember him?

23:51.625 --> 23:53.500
Similar to the young (Marlon Brando)!

23:55.083 --> 23:59.708
That almost made him worthy
of a bike ride all that distance

24:00.875 --> 24:02.000
What distance?

24:02.666 --> 24:03.708
Ronan!

24:04.166 --> 24:06.666
Ronan, that's right!

24:07.041 --> 24:10.333
Did they go on a trip together or something?
- Yes, you can say that

24:10.833 --> 24:12.750
He was the one who ran away with him

24:13.791 --> 24:16.375
Go north, to Donegal, I think

24:17.625 --> 24:20.541
- Did you never mention that?
- No, no

24:21.125 --> 24:23.041
I don't think I've ever mentioned that,
do you, Frank?

24:23.250 --> 24:26.041
Maybe I mentioned it at some point, I'm trying to remember

24:28.958 --> 24:31.875
Was their relationship
serious? no no no...

24:32.041 --> 24:33.208
It was not like that

24:34.416 --> 24:36.500
It just went through a wild period

24:36.708 --> 24:38.916
Come on, let's go back to the bar

24:39.958 --> 24:43.666
I hope we haven't said anything annoying,
Frank.

24:43.958 --> 24:45.833
not at all

24:46.666 --> 24:51.083
If you wanted to know more
then Brigid came from Kinvara...

24:51.208 --> 24:53.416
You can always try to ask her

24:53.500 --> 24:54.500
Brigid!  No...

24:55.833 --> 24:57.083
No, it's okay

24:58.375 --> 24:59.541
It doesn't really matter

24:59.750 --> 25:02.500
It is absolutely true!

25:02.791 --> 25:05.791
"29"

25:13.458 --> 25:14.083
Brigid!

25:14.958 --> 25:15.833
Yes

25:16.166 --> 25:18.250
I'm Frank... Vogel.

25:20.125 --> 25:21.375
Will you allow a moment of your time?

25:22.541 --> 25:23.791
Ronan Quinn?

25:24.166 --> 25:26.083
I met him when we were in Galway.

25:26.833 --> 25:28.250
We did not know him well

25:28.416 --> 25:30.208
He was not a student or anything

25:31.500 --> 25:34.416
And when her parents asked her
to refrain from seeing him, Hassan...

25:34.708 --> 25:35.958
Know our dear (Anna)

25:36.250 --> 25:38.291
She really had an adventurous side

25:38.416 --> 25:39.166
Yes, indeed

25:40.833 --> 25:42.458
It was her little secret

25:43.083 --> 25:43.750
For her alone

25:44.458 --> 25:46.250
It was not like everyone else

25:48.333 --> 25:49.250
where is he now?

25:50.541 --> 25:52.583
His family was raising horses in Connemara.

25:52.708 --> 25:55.041
But I have no idea
if he's there or not

25:57.208 --> 26:01.791
And when she used to come back
here to visit, would they ever go...

26:05.375 --> 26:06.583
You can tell me

26:07.583 --> 26:08.583
Frank...

26:09.291 --> 26:11.416
I am sure this will not happen

26:23.041 --> 26:24.208
Why are you still awake?

26:24.666 --> 26:25.750
I...

26:26.791 --> 26:28.500
I got tired after traveling

26:36.500 --> 26:37.500
Listen...

26:37.916 --> 26:38.791
What?

26:39.750 --> 26:43.833
When I was young, I accompanied
your mother here on these visits

26:45.625 --> 26:50.500
Are you sure she never mentioned
Lake Alan or... or anything...

26:51.166 --> 26:52.083
else?

26:53.583 --> 26:55.166
No, no, you didn't

26:55.375 --> 26:58.250
But I am tired and want to go to
sleep. Can we sleep, I want to sleep

26:58.416 --> 26:59.208
Well, good

27:07.708 --> 27:11.625
These meetings, for your information, may be
more enjoyable if you drink from time to time

27:24.291 --> 27:25.250
I thought you were tired

27:27.416 --> 27:28.666
Where are you going?

27:53.125 --> 27:53.916
I `m back

27:54.666 --> 27:55.583
What?

27:56.333 --> 27:57.333
I saw you

27:58.458 --> 27:59.541
I was standing there

28:01.041 --> 28:02.500
I smiled, so she smiled at me

28:03.708 --> 28:05.416
- Maybe I thought so. - Yes

28:06.041 --> 28:06.916
Maybe she smiled

28:11.333 --> 28:12.708
My name is Sean

28:15.166 --> 28:15.875
(Jules)

28:16.416 --> 28:17.166
Jules?

28:18.458 --> 28:19.291
(Jules)

28:20.041 --> 28:21.375
What a luxurious name!

28:25.791 --> 28:29.291
Will you stay here tonight?
Are you staying in the hotel?

28:30.500 --> 28:31.500
This is possible

28:36.833 --> 28:38.375
Will you buy me a drink?

28:38.750 --> 28:39.041
Yes

28:40.125 --> 28:41.416
Yes of course

28:44.541 --> 28:45.875
(Jameson) without snow

28:46.208 --> 28:47.500
Two please, 214

28:52.041 --> 28:53.916
What brings you here...

28:54.125 --> 28:55.416
I mean to Ireland

28:56.208 --> 29:01.166
I'm going from Alabama to California...

29:01.625 --> 29:04.708
Northwest Ireland

29:06.333 --> 29:08.875
You chose the scenic road,
then, right?

29:09.625 --> 29:12.750
However, I came for a real estate transaction

29:12.958 --> 29:15.583
I have to complete it while I'm here, thank you

29:16.041 --> 29:16.500
Your health

29:17.875 --> 29:19.000
Your health

29:21.375 --> 29:22.375
if...

29:24.375 --> 29:27.291
Do you live here? Do you
have a home in Dublin?

29:27.500 --> 29:29.500
I even had a home...

29:29.750 --> 29:31.083
This morning

29:32.666 --> 29:34.166
Today I find my way to escape

29:34.250 --> 29:36.500
Oh really?  Well then, escape from what?

29:37.416 --> 29:39.458
A very violent ex-friend

29:41.375 --> 29:45.000
A person who does not seem to believe
the laws against domestic violence...

29:45.416 --> 29:46.375
Do not apply to it

29:51.958 --> 29:52.833
Come on...

29:54.041 --> 29:56.083
Follow my words with a good courtship

29:57.958 --> 29:58.666
Sometimes...

30:00.500 --> 30:03.916
One is dominant, and sometimes defeated

30:05.333 --> 30:06.333
This is life

30:12.291 --> 30:14.333
Maybe we should have another cup of this?

30:14.666 --> 30:15.750
I think so

30:18.041 --> 30:19.000
over there

30:19.625 --> 30:20.750
From this direction

30:21.416 --> 30:22.500
Really? Yes

30:22.833 --> 30:24.958
How amazing!  I tell you that this man...

30:25.125 --> 30:28.500
- He loves to stop every hour to fill
up or urinate - Yes, she told me that

30:28.708 --> 30:30.791
I swear if I were driving we
would have arrived within 3 hours

30:30.916 --> 30:32.541
- Yes, of course. - Yes

30:39.416 --> 30:40.291
Moment...

30:41.250 --> 30:43.458
- (Sean) Are you
sure it is your car? Yes

30:47.625 --> 30:50.500
- Sean, come on.
- I don't want to wake up the keys to take my dad

30:50.666 --> 30:54.041
Reception"

30:55.708 --> 30:56.541
I am done!

30:58.500 --> 30:59.500
We are ready

31:02.416 --> 31:03.083
Hassan

31:06.333 --> 31:07.375
ladies First

31:18.041 --> 31:19.333
I didn't offer...

31:19.833 --> 31:21.833
I have been doing this since I was 15

31:22.708 --> 31:24.708
And that was in a Daihatsu.

31:26.500 --> 31:29.416
I have no idea Daihatsu, but...

31:29.750 --> 31:31.875
I tell you,
Audi will be really beautiful

31:51.208 --> 31:52.291
What is that?

31:53.041 --> 31:54.750
What? Bad tattoo?

31:56.833 --> 31:58.500
No, it's more like...

31:59.208 --> 32:00.500
Too bad

32:02.083 --> 32:04.250
That man used to act harshly
after drinking a few glasses

32:04.458 --> 32:06.750
He liked smoking the Masters cigarettes.

32:08.708 --> 32:09.708
Was it burning you?

32:10.583 --> 32:10.875
Yes

32:11.416 --> 32:14.125
- This is very brutal
- not important

32:19.916 --> 32:22.208
I apologize, I feel slight dizziness

32:23.125 --> 32:24.125
Hassan

32:24.958 --> 32:27.416
I need to breathe some air.
- Yes

32:28.375 --> 32:29.250
Damn!

32:36.333 --> 32:37.375
I apologize

32:38.166 --> 32:39.125
I apologize

32:44.500 --> 32:48.500
This is not my best first date

32:52.291 --> 32:53.708
Not the worst for me

32:56.208 --> 32:59.083
You don't have to
stay if you don't want to

32:59.291 --> 33:00.375
As you know

33:07.166 --> 33:08.416
I know

33:30.583 --> 33:32.083
- Is that him? Yes

33:32.416 --> 33:33.875
Well, you know what to do?

33:34.416 --> 33:37.000
- Can you do this? Yeah,
I think I'll get it done

33:37.375 --> 33:38.083
Hassan

33:52.041 --> 33:53.041
Hello

33:53.666 --> 33:56.833
- Good morning.
- This is Jules. We'll take it our way, all right?

33:58.291 --> 34:00.708
I apologize,
we cannot transport the intrusive travelers

34:01.125 --> 34:02.333
Not an intrusive traveler

34:02.500 --> 34:04.375
Not an intrusive traveler,
but I met her last night

34:04.500 --> 34:06.041
She is going to that...

34:06.375 --> 34:07.625
where are you going? - (Larn)

34:07.833 --> 34:09.708
Larn... (Larn) It's close to the lake

34:10.500 --> 34:11.500
I apologize, miss

34:12.375 --> 34:14.541
She is running away from a difficult situation, okay?

34:16.166 --> 34:17.250
We can't do that

34:17.375 --> 34:20.333
Do you know something? Not bad, I
was not the least intrusive traveler either

34:20.458 --> 34:22.041
- Wait, just wait - no,
it's okay

34:22.083 --> 34:24.416
Just a moment,
give me just a moment, okay?

34:24.625 --> 34:25.166
do not go

34:25.333 --> 34:26.208
"Speed ​​limits 10 km per hour"

34:26.291 --> 34:27.208
Listen...

34:27.500 --> 34:28.708
The place is close to our destination

34:28.916 --> 34:29.916
what is your problem?

34:31.916 --> 34:35.166
We can't do that. Is that what you
consider to be respect for women?

34:37.500 --> 34:39.000
Wait, wait, right!

34:44.208 --> 34:45.583
Are you coming or not?

34:45.625 --> 34:46.500
No!

34:47.458 --> 34:49.583
Don't want to see your
home? There is nothing wrong

35:00.166 --> 35:01.250
Hassan

35:02.541 --> 35:03.583
Yes, let me guess

35:04.250 --> 35:06.291
- She turned on the radio
all night? I did not do anything

35:08.583 --> 35:09.541
Listen...

35:11.708 --> 35:14.875
Sorry, would you like to
lift the engine cover? What?

35:14.958 --> 35:16.666
Engine hood My dad is mechanical

35:17.083 --> 35:19.083
It's okay, miss, I have rental insurance

35:19.250 --> 35:20.958
Just lift the damn cap!

35:29.833 --> 35:31.250
Would you like to try it on?

35:40.041 --> 35:42.750
The battery wires were only slightly oxidized

35:43.125 --> 35:44.750
Let your flight be truly safe

35:45.000 --> 35:46.708
Make sure to stop every hour or two

35:46.791 --> 35:49.375
Because that makes the long journey look shorter

36:19.833 --> 36:24.875
"Like rain pouring down the ground,
it calms me when I touch my hand."

36:25.333 --> 36:26.916
"It feels so beautiful."

36:27.708 --> 36:29.416
"Yes, very beautiful."

36:29.750 --> 36:32.375
Frozen Dairy Products

36:33.083 --> 36:38.125
"That visible smile on her face can
warm the room and set fire to the place."

36:38.625 --> 36:40.458
Yes, you can do that.

36:41.125 --> 36:42.541
"You know she can do this."

37:11.791 --> 37:13.250
Maybe you can fix it?

37:14.500 --> 37:16.500
You knew it was this way all the time,
right?

37:16.583 --> 37:19.583
I didn't even know that she had a home here

37:20.916 --> 37:22.375
Among other things

37:23.791 --> 37:25.583
I have 3 days to reach Auckland.

37:30.500 --> 37:32.000
3 days for a sample

37:32.416 --> 37:33.708
Its location is good as you see

37:40.708 --> 37:45.958
It is at the end of this road towards Athlone
and then follow the signs and take us there

37:46.833 --> 37:49.125
Have you ever visited that area,
Mr. Vogel?

37:49.333 --> 37:51.208
No, miss, I didn't

37:51.500 --> 37:53.291
But my mom was there, right?

37:58.166 --> 37:59.875
What is this anyway then?

38:01.208 --> 38:03.958
You two are father
and son on a fishing trip

38:04.500 --> 38:07.666
Initially we all sorted out between
the father and his son somewhat

38:08.125 --> 38:09.291
Only pay the bail

38:11.333 --> 38:13.916
Sorry,
can I repeat that? I couldn't hear you

38:14.541 --> 38:17.416
I said, unless I counted the payment of the surety

38:18.500 --> 38:19.666
Pay the warranty, good

38:20.000 --> 38:21.625
I was fifteen years old

38:21.958 --> 38:25.166
My friends and I took that car on a tour

38:25.541 --> 38:27.750
Call the police and report the theft

38:28.125 --> 38:29.916
The police caught us in two minutes

38:30.916 --> 38:33.500
They threw us in prison and
everyone's parents came at the same hour

38:33.583 --> 38:35.666
As for this man, he came after 24 hours

38:36.125 --> 38:37.916
His mother was in the hospital again

38:38.333 --> 38:40.416
I was dealing with that and trying to deal with it

38:40.500 --> 38:43.083
So I was the reason for my father's nervous breakdown

38:45.041 --> 38:48.166
- Sorry, I wasn't...
- It wasn't a nervous breakdown

38:48.375 --> 38:51.000
I was doing my best
in a very difficult time

38:51.208 --> 38:53.333
But my son couldn't understand this

38:53.750 --> 38:55.708
You wanted a parent like Clark Kent.

38:56.208 --> 38:58.500
I had Clark Kent but
I wanted Superman!

38:58.625 --> 39:00.625
We only wanted a naughty boy

39:01.291 --> 39:05.083
But instead of watching him playing
baseball, we had to visit him in prison

39:05.375 --> 39:06.541
Criminal acts...

39:07.083 --> 39:08.833
Car theft and fires...

39:09.166 --> 39:10.500
- Making fires? Fabricate fires!
- and possession...

39:11.000 --> 39:12.250
Do you want to talk about making fires?

39:12.541 --> 39:15.416
Remember when I told you how my grandfather
used my shoulders as an ashtray?

39:15.500 --> 39:17.208
That guy was just standing
there and watching it happen

39:17.375 --> 39:20.250
That's not true. I had no idea
he had had a drink for years

39:20.375 --> 39:21.625
In a moment like that!

39:21.833 --> 39:24.041
What kind of father never does anything?

39:24.125 --> 39:25.458
I could not see anything!

39:25.541 --> 39:28.541
I saw you, you just passed by

39:28.708 --> 39:30.333
- I pretended you hadn't
seen - I couldn't see anything!

39:30.416 --> 39:31.208
Bullshit!

39:31.333 --> 39:33.500
I was not fully aware at the time...

39:33.541 --> 39:35.500
- And you could have done
something with that - I couldn't!

39:38.375 --> 39:40.666
It's okay, Frank.

39:42.333 --> 39:44.666
How did your stomach become?
- She is ill

39:53.625 --> 39:55.875
(Kelty Klhoher) Road No. 283

39:55.958 --> 39:57.416
Where are you going, heaven?

39:57.500 --> 39:58.708
Why are you turning here?

40:18.750 --> 40:20.833
Leave the keys, we want to listen to the radio

40:25.666 --> 40:26.666
Firstly

40:35.375 --> 40:36.416
Is that...

40:36.541 --> 40:38.208
Is it more important than Auckland?

40:39.041 --> 40:40.041
Why the wheel?

40:40.666 --> 40:43.083
I have work in an electronic repository

40:44.500 --> 40:45.500
seriously?

40:45.625 --> 40:47.791
Seriously, real work with a real salary

40:48.791 --> 40:52.208
Others will get the job if I
don't get there by Monday

40:52.666 --> 40:53.833
What then?

40:54.583 --> 40:56.375
Wouldn't you just be
able to find another job?

40:57.625 --> 40:58.791
It is not that easy

41:01.583 --> 41:05.458
Do you know what is the first
reason people return to prison?

41:07.333 --> 41:08.833
Because they are committing more crimes?

41:09.833 --> 41:11.291
Because they cannot find work

41:13.041 --> 41:14.208
I will not come back

41:22.083 --> 41:23.500
You are the first person...

41:24.125 --> 41:26.083
A long time ago I loved...

41:28.750 --> 41:29.916
Love to talk to him

41:34.125 --> 41:35.625
I am glad to talk to you

42:06.000 --> 42:07.250
Sorry, can I help you?

42:08.375 --> 42:09.541
Hello

42:10.041 --> 42:11.083
Welcome

42:11.666 --> 42:13.875
I knocked on the door of the house,
but no one answered me

42:15.666 --> 42:16.666
Yes

42:19.166 --> 42:20.333
Are you (Ronan)?

42:22.583 --> 42:23.833
Excuse me, who are you?

42:24.791 --> 42:25.875
I'm Frank

42:27.166 --> 42:28.583
(Anna) was my wife

42:37.708 --> 42:38.916
No, (Ronan) was my brother

42:39.041 --> 42:40.041
lhave...

42:40.625 --> 42:43.166
He passed away 30 years ago

42:49.291 --> 42:50.416
Is this your wife?

42:52.416 --> 42:53.458
Yes

42:54.666 --> 42:56.541
Come, let me see you something

43:05.208 --> 43:07.958
(Triumph Thunderbird) model 1963

43:09.416 --> 43:11.541
It took me a long time
to find the whole piece

43:14.458 --> 43:17.916
After Ronan's death,
I tried to reassemble it again

43:18.666 --> 43:19.958
I really don't know why

43:22.125 --> 43:24.083
Did he ever mention my wife to you?

43:26.375 --> 43:28.666
No, no, as I remember, but...

43:30.875 --> 43:33.833
We weren't really connected at the time

43:36.125 --> 43:40.208
Well, I should just let you go
back to your horse if I can...

43:41.208 --> 43:42.791
Right, yes

43:43.583 --> 43:44.583
Yes

43:44.958 --> 43:46.458
Thank you. Take care of yourself

43:46.833 --> 43:47.833
you too

43:48.833 --> 43:49.833
Hassan

43:57.000 --> 43:58.375
Sorry, one thing yet

43:58.750 --> 43:59.750
Yes?

44:00.958 --> 44:02.500
Where is your brother buried?

44:03.000 --> 44:04.708
He was not buried, but was burned

44:05.250 --> 44:07.333
To spread his ashes over a lake

44:07.791 --> 44:08.791
in the north

44:40.500 --> 44:41.625
Listen, Frank!

44:45.250 --> 44:46.375
Frank?

44:53.416 --> 44:55.500
are you OK?
- Yes, you're getting wet

44:56.083 --> 44:57.083
Yes

44:57.875 --> 44:59.125
We both get wet

45:00.041 --> 45:01.041
Let's go

45:03.125 --> 45:04.291
Are you sure you are fine?

45:40.791 --> 45:43.750
Are you not hungry? no thanks

45:46.500 --> 45:48.375
We should be able to
get to Donegal tonight

45:53.958 --> 45:54.958
What is that?

45:57.750 --> 45:59.166
- Your wife? Yes

46:00.208 --> 46:01.375
She is very beautiful

46:01.958 --> 46:03.375
Where did you pick up?

46:03.791 --> 46:05.625
Somewhere during their honeymoon

46:06.250 --> 46:07.375
Honeymoon with...

46:08.041 --> 46:09.208
Mr. Motorcyclist?

46:09.416 --> 46:12.916
Yes, before he gets lucky and
dies in a tragic motorbike accident

46:13.083 --> 46:14.833
Bring it!  Forget it, man

46:14.958 --> 46:16.458
Yes, but she married you

46:17.833 --> 46:19.208
You settled with me...

46:20.708 --> 46:22.083
But she never forgot him...

46:23.875 --> 46:26.875
His ashes roam the surface of
that lake and I am just a delivery boy

46:27.000 --> 46:28.416
My mission is to bring them back together

46:28.500 --> 46:31.375
There are about 10,000 lakes in
Ireland. Are you sure it is the same?

46:34.666 --> 46:35.875
I do not know

46:36.500 --> 46:37.500
Where did you meet?

46:38.291 --> 46:40.166
On a bus in Detroit

46:40.583 --> 46:42.125
A book fell from it and I picked it up

46:42.791 --> 46:44.041
I never told her that I...

46:45.041 --> 46:48.333
I took that bus in the wrong
direction daily for three weeks

46:48.875 --> 46:50.625
I am waiting for her to expect something

46:53.250 --> 46:54.500
How foolish I was!

46:56.958 --> 46:58.250
Listen, I will tell you this...

46:58.625 --> 47:00.833
We may have experience with the rebels...

47:02.250 --> 47:04.458
But those with good hearts are
those who spend our lives with them

47:04.541 --> 47:07.125
"I met my love"

47:07.583 --> 47:08.416
I love this song

47:08.500 --> 47:10.791
Near the wall of the gas plant.

47:12.500 --> 47:15.166
And I dreamed of a dream

47:15.708 --> 47:18.083
"Near the old canal"

47:19.375 --> 47:21.583
"I kissed my love"

47:23.000 --> 47:25.250
"Near the factory wall."

47:27.208 --> 47:28.750
"Dirty Old Town"

47:30.833 --> 47:32.791
"Dirty Old Town"

47:33.833 --> 47:34.958
Do you want to join us, my dear?

47:35.500 --> 47:38.625
- No, no, you are better off without me -
Come on, they are tired of my old voice

47:39.000 --> 47:41.083
- No. - Come on, don't be shy

47:45.666 --> 47:48.041
"The clouds pass"

47:48.875 --> 47:51.333
"Versus the moon"

47:52.875 --> 47:59.333
And cats roam according to their will.

48:00.166 --> 48:03.041
Spring is a girl.

48:03.583 --> 48:06.250
"From the streets at night"

48:07.750 --> 48:10.166
"Dirty Old Town"

48:11.500 --> 48:13.500
"Dirty Old Town"

48:21.416 --> 48:22.458
What?

48:24.500 --> 48:27.333
(Perfect Report)

48:29.708 --> 48:32.291
"I met my love"

48:33.375 --> 48:35.916
Near the wall of the gas plant.

48:37.708 --> 48:41.041
And I dreamed of a dream

48:41.166 --> 48:43.708
"Near the old canal"

48:45.500 --> 48:48.041
"I kissed my love"

48:49.083 --> 48:51.750
"Near the factory wall."

48:53.541 --> 48:56.708
"Dirty Old Town"

48:57.583 --> 49:01.041
"Dirty Old Town"

49:06.916 --> 49:08.500
Thanks for our nice singer over there

49:11.500 --> 49:13.375
(Guinness) beer

49:13.625 --> 49:14.625
Welcome

49:16.250 --> 49:18.208
Heard you sing while...

49:19.708 --> 49:20.708
Thank you

49:20.958 --> 49:22.083
you have a nice voice

49:23.375 --> 49:24.125
Thank you

49:24.291 --> 49:27.583
"Dramcross" Inn

49:38.041 --> 49:39.833
You're a very kind man, Frank.

49:41.416 --> 49:42.916
That is why I fell in love with you

49:44.208 --> 49:45.250
You make...

49:46.000 --> 49:47.583
The girl feels honored

49:59.250 --> 50:00.250
Thank you

50:03.625 --> 50:06.541
Do you mind sitting in the foreground?
Because I felt dizzy in the car before

50:06.916 --> 50:08.333
not at all

50:17.791 --> 50:18.916
magical touch

50:51.041 --> 50:52.333
I will not steal it

50:55.250 --> 50:56.500
See you at half past six

50:56.916 --> 50:58.708
right Now? Hassan

51:02.250 --> 51:03.250
Thank you

51:04.500 --> 51:05.500
good night

51:23.458 --> 51:24.750
Is it still raining outside?

51:27.041 --> 51:29.791
The sun will rise tomorrow,
that would be great

51:32.083 --> 51:33.333
Bring it...

51:35.375 --> 51:36.500
Where is my mother?

51:37.250 --> 51:38.250
lhave...

51:39.500 --> 51:41.958
I thought you would bring it with you

51:42.291 --> 51:43.291
Damn!

51:45.958 --> 51:48.541
Do you know something? We
will start our journey early and...

51:49.125 --> 51:50.500
Indeed (Ireland)

51:51.083 --> 51:53.791
So I guess she'll be fine,
right?

52:02.583 --> 52:04.208
How did Jules pay for her room?

52:04.458 --> 52:05.916
You will send me a check

52:06.208 --> 52:08.291
Well, I want my own room
and I'll send you a check

52:08.916 --> 52:10.291
No, you will not

52:13.750 --> 52:15.000
It will not send you a check

52:16.458 --> 52:18.583
how do you know that?
- She will not send you a check

52:18.708 --> 52:19.708
Did I tell you that?

52:21.000 --> 52:22.875
It is just another person who takes advantage of you

52:24.250 --> 52:27.041
She does not take advantage of me,
but this is my choice

52:27.375 --> 52:30.250
Just another person... just another
person taking advantage of you, right?

52:30.916 --> 52:33.083
Just put that out of your hand,
stop what you're doing for a moment

52:33.250 --> 52:35.083
Put your toothbrush from your hand, come on, man

52:36.500 --> 52:39.083
What do you do? Raise your hands,
I'll teach you how to fight

52:40.000 --> 52:40.500
I do not want that

52:40.583 --> 52:42.208
- I'll teach you how...
- No, no, it's too late!

52:42.291 --> 52:44.083
I just want to go to sleep,
it was a long day

52:44.208 --> 52:45.833
What do you do? Here you are

52:45.916 --> 52:46.875
- Raise your hands -
What are you doing?

52:46.958 --> 52:48.166
- That's good, come on. - No!

52:48.250 --> 52:49.500
Come on, it's fun,
isn't it? What is that? No

52:49.916 --> 52:51.791
Hey, listen, listen, listen

52:51.916 --> 52:54.541
- If this is about Jules...
- What do you mean about Jules?

52:54.833 --> 52:56.208
what are you talking about?  stand up

52:56.583 --> 52:57.583
Come on

52:57.750 --> 52:58.750
- What are you going to do?

52:59.125 --> 53:00.208
I will do it, what will you do?

53:00.583 --> 53:01.583
What will you do?

53:02.125 --> 53:03.333
What do you do?
- Come on, get up

53:03.458 --> 53:05.041
- Get your hands off me,
enough - Sit down, come on, hit me!

53:05.166 --> 53:07.375
What?
- What will you do? Would you not do anything?

53:08.041 --> 53:09.958
- I saw you both in the hallway,
I saw her kiss you - What? I'm not...

53:10.125 --> 53:11.666
Do you like it? Do you want
to have a relationship with her?

53:12.208 --> 53:13.875
Do you want to take revenge on my mom for betraying you?

53:15.916 --> 53:17.083
leave me alone!

53:18.708 --> 53:19.875
Bring it!

53:41.166 --> 53:42.416
I am tired of this

53:44.500 --> 53:45.750
I am sick of you

53:47.541 --> 53:49.125
So we will finish this

53:49.750 --> 53:51.291
In the next lake that I see...

53:52.333 --> 53:54.166
We will get away from each other

54:31.875 --> 54:35.083
15th"

55:40.541 --> 55:42.416
15th"

55:45.083 --> 55:46.083
Hello

55:48.375 --> 55:49.375
Sean?

55:50.083 --> 55:51.083
What?

55:53.083 --> 55:54.458
Where... where is Jules?

55:56.208 --> 55:57.375
I do not know

56:10.000 --> 56:12.041
no no no

56:12.291 --> 56:13.625
- Right! Damn!

56:13.875 --> 56:14.916
What?

56:15.166 --> 56:16.166
No

56:16.333 --> 56:17.458
Right!

56:33.583 --> 56:35.541
Sorry, Aves' service arrived.

56:35.666 --> 56:37.166
Hassan

56:41.416 --> 56:44.458
No, madam, this looks like a
car with a manual transmission

56:44.541 --> 56:46.541
They were supposed
to send an automatic car

56:47.166 --> 56:47.833
Just a moment

56:49.416 --> 56:50.416
Thank you

57:05.291 --> 57:06.541
I will need that airline ticket

57:06.625 --> 57:09.041
- And the taxi back to Dublin.
- You can just accompany me in the car

57:09.666 --> 57:11.833
What are you talking
about heaven? You will stay

57:12.500 --> 57:14.875
No, the insurance covers the rental car

57:15.333 --> 57:18.166
Who cares about the rental
car? What about my mom?

57:18.291 --> 57:19.458
what about her?

57:21.250 --> 57:22.375
You have to get it back

57:24.916 --> 57:25.916
To get it back...

57:27.333 --> 57:28.708
How will I get it back?

57:33.625 --> 57:36.416
I brought her to
Ireland. That's enough

57:38.541 --> 57:41.916
I think she deserves a little more respect
than saying "You brought her to (Ireland)"

57:42.500 --> 57:44.208
I thought one had to gain that respect

57:44.500 --> 57:47.166
She took care of you for twenty-eight
years, I think she earned that respect

57:50.916 --> 57:52.750
Maybe you should take the bus

57:55.708 --> 57:57.958
How will you pay the costs now?

57:58.291 --> 57:59.583
What costs?

57:59.833 --> 58:01.500
That phone call from your room

58:01.625 --> 58:03.583
No, madam, we didn't make any calls

58:03.666 --> 58:04.875
that's wrong

58:06.083 --> 58:07.416
Do you mind seeing this?

58:12.875 --> 58:14.125
Where is this number located?

58:14.833 --> 58:16.666
Seems like it belongs to Northern Ireland.

58:21.500 --> 58:22.500
Thank you

58:23.333 --> 58:24.333
Good day

58:27.083 --> 58:27.875
I found it!

58:28.000 --> 58:30.333
I called a guy
repairing cars in Belfast.

58:30.583 --> 58:31.583
if?

58:32.208 --> 58:33.291
Let's go find her

58:34.166 --> 58:35.583
I thought you should go to Auckland.

58:37.166 --> 58:38.791
Let me worry about this, okay?

58:38.958 --> 58:42.625
and what? Do you think this is
a big misunderstanding, that...

58:43.250 --> 58:47.666
She did not intend to lie to you or steal
the car and she loves you in its depths

58:47.833 --> 58:50.375
- And you'll ride...
- Okay, stop, stop

58:50.500 --> 58:52.416
Forget it all, forget it

58:56.583 --> 58:59.208
Someone stole your car,
which contained your wife's ashes

59:00.833 --> 59:02.208
Doesn't that make you angry?

59:12.125 --> 59:13.166
Will you come or what?

59:15.958 --> 59:17.916
I don't know how to drive a manual transmission

"Aleser" will always be British,
not surrender.

01:00:28.916 --> 01:00:30.500
It might be a stolen car workshop

01:00:35.625 --> 01:00:36.833
What do you do?

01:00:38.708 --> 01:00:40.041
This encroaches on private property

01:00:40.208 --> 01:00:43.500
Let's go through the front door and ask them
if they bought any stolen car today, okay?

01:00:44.000 --> 01:00:45.500
What do you think about doing that?

01:00:56.333 --> 01:00:57.333
let's go

01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.500
Sean!

01:01:50.166 --> 01:01:51.708
- Let's go - it's a dead end

01:01:56.750 --> 01:01:57.750
I will raise you, let's go

01:01:58.041 --> 01:01:59.791
- Okay - wait

01:02:05.208 --> 01:02:07.166
- Do you see it?
- I see number plates

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:08.958
No car

01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:11.500
Damn!

01:02:12.750 --> 01:02:13.916
Just be quiet

01:02:14.875 --> 01:02:15.875
Just keep calm

01:02:16.583 --> 01:02:17.583
Stay calm

01:02:22.041 --> 01:02:23.041
We are ok

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:27.916
Run away!  Run away!

01:02:28.083 --> 01:02:29.083
Run away!

01:02:31.708 --> 01:02:32.875
Come on!  Come on!

01:02:40.916 --> 01:02:41.916
I'm trapped!

01:02:42.500 --> 01:02:43.500
I got you!  Come on!

01:02:45.166 --> 01:02:46.166
Let's go!

01:02:56.500 --> 01:03:00.125
I usually try to dismantle the
stolen car as quickly as possible

01:03:00.208 --> 01:03:02.041
Unless you want to go somewhere

01:03:03.041 --> 01:03:04.791
Larn, I mentioned (Larn)

01:03:04.958 --> 01:03:05.708
We will search for it in a map

01:03:05.791 --> 01:03:08.541
- And we discover a good path together.
- Yes, I think she was lying

01:03:08.625 --> 01:03:11.291
- No, not about that
anyway - that's the hard part

01:03:11.875 --> 01:03:14.125
Try to find out if everything
is a lie or just most of it

01:03:14.250 --> 01:03:15.166
What do you do?

01:03:15.291 --> 01:03:17.208
I'll get you something for your leg,
do you have some money?

01:03:17.416 --> 01:03:19.500

come on

Don't be weak like that, okay?

01:03:40.625 --> 01:03:41.625
Did you find Larn?

01:03:42.166 --> 01:03:43.166

Yes, this is it

01:04:09.208 --> 01:04:10.500
I will find a place to park the car

01:04:14.041 --> 01:04:15.041
Okay, let's break up

01:04:15.166 --> 01:04:17.583
I'll go from that direction,
okay? We will cover such a large area

01:04:27.291 --> 01:04:30.833
We trust Harper's pub.

01:04:33.041 --> 01:04:34.750

Thanks man, I am very hungry

Here she is

the Autol brothers, was founded in 1831.

01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500
No?

Didn't any of you see anything?

01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:27.125
Did you find anything? No

01:05:27.291 --> 01:05:28.958
And you? No

01:05:34.833 --> 01:05:37.875

would have been traveling for a road trip

You know my mother is still in the back,
right?

01:08:14.375 --> 01:08:15.708
Very sorry

01:08:16.207 --> 01:08:18.875
By seeing her it was too late

01:08:21.625 --> 01:08:22.916
I was going to send it to you

01:08:23.416 --> 01:08:24.582
I swear to you

01:08:31.541 --> 01:08:32.625
Is this what you want?

01:08:33.375 --> 01:08:35.041
You wanted a silly car from the start?

01:08:35.291 --> 01:08:36.416
All the time?

01:08:36.875 --> 01:08:37.957
Was any of that...

01:08:41.082 --> 01:08:42.750
Honest?  Was any of that real?

01:08:42.875 --> 01:08:44.166
what do you want me to say?

I had to get out of here

01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:57.500
Then she gave me the same opportunity

01:09:00.541 --> 01:09:01.832
It was that simple

01:09:02.957 --> 01:09:04.375
It was nothing personal

01:09:05.082 --> 01:09:07.082
It provided the same opportunity

01:09:09.582 --> 01:09:10.916
Tell me why you are here

01:09:12.457 --> 01:09:13.625
Why am I here?

01:09:14.416 --> 01:09:16.916
My damned car was stolen,
that's why I'm here

01:09:20.832 --> 01:09:22.250

01:09:23.750 --> 01:09:24.750
come with me

We can pretend that this never happened,
we can...

01:09:29.082 --> 01:09:31.416
We can be together
on a boat for a few days

01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:33.500
Then we will see where that will lead us

01:09:33.957 --> 01:09:35.082
Then what?

what is this?

you'll be able to get to Auckland in time

Let me worry about that

had nothing to do with it

Perhaps not the lake itself

01:13:55.083 --> 01:13:56.125
how is your hand?

01:13:57.833 --> 01:13:58.833
It hurts me badly

01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.833
Yes, it will hurt you in the next
few days. It was a heavy blow

You restored my mom, that...

I was proud of you

01:15:01.708 --> 01:15:03.500
Taxi Cabs.

01:15:08.041 --> 01:15:09.208
Go to the airport

01:15:23.916 --> 01:15:24.833
Hello

01:15:24.916 --> 01:15:27.208
Good morning,
Mr. Vogel. This is a wake-up call.

01:16:01.750 --> 01:16:02.916
Are you done

01:16:03.750 --> 01:16:04.875
Yes, I'm done

01:17:48.708 --> 01:17:50.125
Have you canceled your flight?

01:17:54.958 --> 01:17:55.958
No

01:18:09.333 --> 01:18:11.166
Are we going to finish this then or what?

01:18:19.541 --> 01:18:20.541
Just a moment

01:19:29.125 --> 01:19:30.541
What is wrong?  the battery?

01:19:31.208 --> 01:19:33.166
No, I ran out of fuel

01:19:34.458 --> 01:19:35.500
Well let's go!

01:19:38.625 --> 01:19:39.625
It will not be far

01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:54.083
- Do you hear that? Yes

01:19:56.083 --> 01:19:57.083
It's beautiful

01:20:06.666 --> 01:20:08.208
Still not working well I think

01:20:08.333 --> 01:20:09.541
I can hear the vibration

01:20:11.666 --> 01:20:12.416
Welcome

01:20:12.500 --> 01:20:13.250
"The Lord is love"

01:20:13.333 --> 01:20:15.708
- Can I help?
- Yes, we apologize for the boycott

01:20:16.041 --> 01:20:18.500
We're looking for Lake Alan.

01:20:19.458 --> 01:20:21.833
Do you have an idea if we are in the right neighborhood?

01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.083
Yes, but I fear that you are both in private property

01:20:28.166 --> 01:20:32.875
Hassan, his mother... and my wife,
(Anna Vogel) passed away and...

01:20:33.708 --> 01:20:35.833
She asked to spread her ashes there

01:20:35.958 --> 01:20:38.458
- Anna Vogel? - Yes, this is it

01:20:40.416 --> 01:20:41.541
Yes

01:20:44.541 --> 01:20:45.541
I)?

01:20:46.458 --> 01:20:48.458
I deeply regret her death

01:20:49.833 --> 01:20:50.958
Did you know her?

01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:52.916
From i'tikaf only

01:20:53.250 --> 01:20:55.041
We have a spiritual retreat here

01:20:55.416 --> 01:20:56.916
We rent rooms from the monastery

01:20:57.625 --> 01:20:59.541
I stayed a few times over the years

01:21:00.833 --> 01:21:01.958
Did she ever tell you that?

01:21:02.916 --> 01:21:03.916
No

01:21:04.083 --> 01:21:06.583
Perhaps that was a
personal subject for her, then

01:21:07.125 --> 01:21:09.500
This little private
oasis is not uncommon

01:21:09.958 --> 01:21:11.750
She was a nice woman

01:21:12.958 --> 01:21:13.958
It really was

01:21:15.125 --> 01:21:18.583
When she came here she
would spend a day in the kitchen

01:21:19.041 --> 01:21:20.708
That was her way of contributing

01:21:21.250 --> 01:21:24.333
We were all sitting that night and
enjoying a delicious meal together

01:21:26.541 --> 01:21:28.458
- Sorry for your
loss - Thank you

01:21:29.250 --> 01:21:30.375
The man she was with

01:21:30.500 --> 01:21:33.583
Is there a way to find out if
his ashes are here somewhere?

01:21:33.916 --> 01:21:36.625
I fear there is no way there
are hundreds of lakes here

01:21:37.625 --> 01:21:38.791
Why would you like to know that?

01:21:47.250 --> 01:21:48.250
In fact...

01:21:48.541 --> 01:21:51.041
Lake (Alan) is the lake
that the deer liked to cross

01:21:51.750 --> 01:21:52.916
Its landscape is very picturesque

01:21:54.083 --> 01:21:55.500
The problem is when the fog fills the place

01:21:55.666 --> 01:21:57.458
The deer cannot see the other side

01:21:57.916 --> 01:21:59.250
And gets confused

01:21:59.666 --> 01:22:02.291
And it continues to change direction again and again

01:22:02.750 --> 01:22:04.166
To eventually drown

01:22:05.666 --> 01:22:08.375
You are so close that she is there
after the hill and around the bend

01:22:09.875 --> 01:22:11.125
Be careful of fog

01:22:16.083 --> 01:22:19.375
Property"

01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:44.833
"My mom said to me, Lift your
head from the sieve of your hands."

01:22:45.375 --> 01:22:50.750
"My mom told me that this
pain will eventually go away"

01:22:50.875 --> 01:22:52.041
Beware your mistake there

01:22:54.458 --> 01:22:58.750
"But the shock waves
on my bones will remain."

01:22:59.208 --> 01:23:04.500
"Like your ghost here on my bed."

01:23:05.416 --> 01:23:13.416
"When I got lost I saw that I was pretty"

01:23:13.541 --> 01:23:20.833
Sometimes I think of you asleep,
so sleep for a while.

01:23:21.083 --> 01:23:27.041
Sometimes I ask myself who does this with love

01:23:29.416 --> 01:23:35.000
And to the tops of the white mountains going up.

01:23:35.208 --> 01:23:42.541
"Oh my God, you put me on the side of this path."

01:23:43.000 --> 01:23:49.875
"It's cold here and I
don't want to walk alone."

01:23:50.916 --> 01:23:56.291
"I carry inside you a bottle of your blood."

01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:08.541
"A beggar prayers on the tip of my tongue"

01:24:23.333 --> 01:24:25.500
Jam (Hillside) with blueberry.

01:24:44.125 --> 01:24:45.500
Do you want to bid it farewell?

01:24:50.416 --> 01:24:51.416
Good-bye

01:24:57.916 --> 01:25:06.250
"My mom said to me, Lift your
head from the sieve of your hands."

01:25:06.666 --> 01:25:15.041
"My mom told me that this
pain will eventually go away"

01:25:24.166 --> 01:25:25.250
my love...

01:25:27.333 --> 01:25:28.500
we have arrived

01:25:31.958 --> 01:25:33.166
we are here

01:25:41.333 --> 01:25:42.875
Receive love from you...

01:25:49.166 --> 01:25:50.375
Was the greatest...

01:25:51.541 --> 01:25:52.750
Present...

01:25:58.416 --> 01:26:00.166
The greatest privilege...

01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:04.416
in my life

01:26:09.041 --> 01:26:11.250
That is in addition to being a father...

01:26:18.708 --> 01:26:19.875
Damn!

01:26:21.583 --> 01:26:23.083
nothing else matters

01:26:26.291 --> 01:26:27.750
nothing else matters

01:27:06.125 --> 01:27:07.458
What do you do?

01:27:07.958 --> 01:27:09.375
I will go swimming with your mother

01:27:27.333 --> 01:27:28.791
Will you come or what?

01:27:29.250 --> 01:27:31.541
Impossible, the water is too cold, man

01:27:31.666 --> 01:27:32.708
that's it

01:27:37.750 --> 01:27:39.000
Damn it!

01:27:45.583 --> 01:27:46.583
Damn!

01:28:22.750 --> 01:28:24.375
So what will you do now?

01:28:27.166 --> 01:28:29.750
I don’t know, maybe I will stay here for a while

01:28:30.041 --> 01:28:31.041
I travel intrusively

01:28:32.458 --> 01:28:33.958
To see where it will take me the way

01:28:35.083 --> 01:28:37.625
That open distance is all good now

01:28:43.333 --> 01:28:44.541
I returned to your knowledge

01:28:46.291 --> 01:28:49.083
I went back to face your grandfather after burning you

01:28:52.041 --> 01:28:53.875
I knew exactly what I was going to say

01:28:56.166 --> 01:28:58.625
I was in the middle of it, and I attacked him strongly

01:29:01.250 --> 01:29:03.666
Then he just started laughing at me

01:29:06.583 --> 01:29:08.166
I didn't know what to do

01:29:13.375 --> 01:29:14.625
So I got out...

01:29:15.750 --> 01:29:17.125
The car drove away...

01:29:19.166 --> 01:29:20.833
I never saw him again

01:29:24.416 --> 01:29:25.625
You did not see him either

01:29:40.708 --> 01:29:43.041
Is this what my mom wanted to see then?

01:29:47.166 --> 01:29:48.875
The place is really beautiful here

01:29:54.708 --> 01:29:55.833
It really is

01:30:47.916 --> 01:30:52.000
"Gray hills in midnight green."

01:30:54.500 --> 01:31:00.125
"As the sun overlooks the mountain peaks tonight."

01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:10.416
"I almost touch it."

01:31:15.541 --> 01:31:19.500
"Birds pronounce words like I said."

01:31:22.208 --> 01:31:27.541
"The songs sleep on the river floor tonight."

01:31:28.750 --> 01:31:32.750
- "Akkad..."
- "The End of Judgment"

01:31:32.833 --> 01:31:37.416
"To hear it"

01:32:10.291 --> 01:32:13.833
Sometimes I wish I were you.

01:32:17.250 --> 01:32:23.416
"I walk around your secret lake and I melt"

01:32:23.708 --> 01:32:33.125
I wander with you.

01:32:37.541 --> 01:32:41.541
"I wonder if you think about"

01:32:44.500 --> 01:32:50.250
Or if you know how
heavy I feel tonight

01:32:51.250 --> 01:33:00.041
"I can almost hear you"

01:34:03.000 --> 01:34:09.875
"All the money I had."

01:34:10.666 --> 01:34:17.000
"I spent it in good company."

01:34:18.333 --> 01:34:24.916
And all the harm it did.

01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:31.916
"Unfortunately, no one but me."

01:34:33.083 --> 01:34:40.625
"And all I did was because of my fools."

01:34:41.250 --> 01:34:47.625
"For a memory I can't remember now."

01:34:48.791 --> 01:34:55.750
"So, pour me a cup of separation."

01:34:56.458 --> 01:35:04.916
"I wish a good night and happiness to all of you."

01:35:11.375 --> 01:35:18.000
"All the comrades I accompanied."

01:35:18.375 --> 01:35:24.208
"I am sorry for my departure"

01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:31.208
And all the granules that I loved.

01:35:31.666 --> 01:35:38.625
"I wish I could stay another day"

01:35:39.833 --> 01:35:47.500
But since this was my share

01:35:48.000 --> 01:35:55.000
"I have to get up
while you don't"

01:35:55.708 --> 01:36:02.125
"So I will rise kindly and call gently."

01:36:02.583 --> 01:36:11.500
"I wish a good night and happiness to all of you."
