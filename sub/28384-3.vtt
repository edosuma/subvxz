00:05.167 --> 00:06.667
- Why are we here?
- Alister Peel.

00:06.700 --> 00:08.167
[Eve] The internet guy? Really?

00:08.200 --> 00:09.833
I'm afraid your father
was murdered.

00:09.867 --> 00:11.567
What does this
look like to you?

00:11.600 --> 00:12.900
- Discreet.
- Boring.

00:12.933 --> 00:14.667
Villanelle is
an attention seeker.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.900
She wants people to know
when she's killed someone.

00:16.933 --> 00:18.167
She wants me to know.

00:18.200 --> 00:21.167
A new girl?
Villanelle will be furious!

00:21.200 --> 00:23.400
- The Ghost?
- The opposite of Villanelle.

00:23.433 --> 00:26.300
- Who are you?
- Raymond, your new handler.

00:26.333 --> 00:30.000
You're on a very tight leash
from now on.

00:30.033 --> 00:32.600
Promise you won't be cross.

00:37.733 --> 00:39.167
You want a drink?

00:42.267 --> 00:44.367

How are you doing?

01:13.100 --> 01:16.400
Honestly, it feels like I'm
losing my mind a little bit.

01:16.433 --> 01:17.833
Yeah.

01:20.267 --> 01:21.933
[Both chuckle]

01:27.533 --> 01:29.333
What did Carolyn give you?

01:29.367 --> 01:31.300
M.I.6. are protecting
my family.

01:31.333 --> 01:33.133
Do they know you're alive?

01:33.167 --> 01:35.033
No.

01:35.067 --> 01:38.167
- My daughter thinks I'm dead.
- Oh.

01:38.200 --> 01:40.233
And you're happy
not seeing her again?

01:41.667 --> 01:44.400
Change the subject.

01:44.433 --> 01:45.933
Do you know
where Villanelle is?

01:47.600 --> 01:49.500
- You don't want to know.
- Of course I do.

01:49.533 --> 01:51.500
Leave her alone.

01:51.533 --> 01:53.533
She's a parasite, Eve.

01:53.567 --> 01:56.667
She gets into your brain,
she eats you up,

01:56.700 --> 01:59.467
to make space for herself.

01:59.500 --> 02:02.333
Like that book with the hungry
worm and all that food.

02:03.267 --> 02:05.000
Pickles, tomatoes...

02:05.033 --> 02:07.000
- "The Hungry Caterpillar"?
- Yes.

02:07.033 --> 02:09.500
That's her.

02:09.533 --> 02:11.567
Burrowing in
and creeping around.

02:11.600 --> 02:14.833
It would be convenient,
wouldn't it, for me to give...

02:14.867 --> 02:17.800
Why should I lie about this?
You've something worth having.

02:17.833 --> 02:19.367
Don't let her take it.

02:19.400 --> 02:21.267
I won't.

02:22.167 --> 02:23.933
You think she loves you?

02:25.100 --> 02:27.867
Then make her hate you.

02:27.900 --> 02:30.867
Hate is something she
understands, it's manageable.

02:30.900 --> 02:33.300
Look what happens
to the people she loves.

02:33.333 --> 02:35.200
She'll love you to death.

02:36.500 --> 02:38.367
Look at Anna, Nadia.

02:39.400 --> 02:41.267
And look at me.

Excuse me, sir.

02:59.933 --> 03:02.900
I'm so sorry to bother you but
are you Greg Richardson?

03:02.933 --> 03:04.633
Yes.

03:04.667 --> 03:07.667
I read the article about you
in "The Economist".

03:10.700 --> 03:12.767
Well, I've always wanted
to work here.

03:13.833 --> 03:15.733
Congratulations. Enjoy the job.

03:17.167 --> 03:19.067
No, I mean doing what you do.

03:19.100 --> 03:21.033
Are there any internships open?

03:21.067 --> 03:22.800
Do you have a degree?

03:22.833 --> 03:24.700
No, but I'm...
I'm a fast learner.

03:24.733 --> 03:26.133
I can't help you.

03:26.167 --> 03:28.733
I read in the article about
dressing for success.

03:28.767 --> 03:31.467
It's my dad's 50th birthday, I
want to get something special.

03:31.500 --> 03:33.400
I've been saving up.

03:33.433 --> 03:36.333
This is perfect.
Where's it from?

03:37.233 --> 03:38.500
Hermes.

03:40.100 --> 03:42.967
[In normal voice]
No, it's not.

- What's happening?
- I made you breakfast.

04:29.167 --> 04:30.933
What did you do,
did you murder someone?

04:31.867 --> 04:34.133
No!

04:34.167 --> 04:36.033
I just thought
it would be nice.

04:36.067 --> 04:39.167
Thank you. Look, I'm sorry.

04:39.200 --> 04:41.867
- Mm-hm.
- This looks...delicious.

04:44.367 --> 04:45.567
What is it?

04:46.933 --> 04:48.633
An omelet.

04:48.667 --> 04:51.300

04:51.333 --> 04:53.567
..if you wanted
to show your devotion,

04:53.600 --> 04:55.700
you could just do
the easiest thing.

04:55.733 --> 04:57.600
- [Laughs] Oh, yeah?
- Yeah.

04:59.000 --> 05:00.867

05:04.600 --> 05:06.800
No, I gotta go to work.
I'm sorry.

05:06.833 --> 05:08.500
Later, I promise.

05:12.567 --> 05:15.167
I'll just masturbate onto
this omelet, then, I guess.

Sure.

Do you get a lot of guests
here?

05:54.567 --> 05:56.900
Yes, thank you. We do.

05:57.933 --> 05:59.467
Room 207.

05:59.500 --> 06:02.133
One of your company's
usual suites.

a letter for you.

Seven, not including
the one on the pillow.

06:37.100 --> 06:39.033
- How did it go?
- [Sighs] Fine.

06:39.067 --> 06:42.867
Boring and discreet,
just like you asked.

06:42.900 --> 06:45.967
His tie got stuck
in the elevator door. Ohh.

06:46.000 --> 06:48.367
That doesn't sound boring
or discreet, does it?

06:48.400 --> 06:50.433
I moved the cameras and
made it look like an accident.

you want me to fail, Raymond.

You don't need any help in
the failure department from me.

it's only a matter of time.

07:06.533 --> 07:08.500
Oh, didn't you know?

07:08.533 --> 07:10.333
There's a new girl in town.

07:11.333 --> 07:12.733
Uh-oh.

07:14.267 --> 07:15.933
Are you trying
to make me jealous?

07:17.933 --> 07:20.533
I'm glad you hired
another woman.

07:20.567 --> 07:22.467
She can take up the slack,

07:22.500 --> 07:24.367
do the easy stuff,

07:24.400 --> 07:26.900
take the fat old ones
who can't run very fast.

07:26.933 --> 07:28.800
She doesn't work for us.

07:28.833 --> 07:33.567
Yet. But the higher-ups are
very impressed with her work.

07:33.600 --> 07:36.167
So you'd better hope M.I.6
find her before we do.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.200
Otherwise you might be
out of a job.

07:38.233 --> 07:41.067
M.I.6 are looking for her?

07:41.100 --> 07:44.267
Yes, your friend Eve Polastri.

You don't mind her getting the

together a huge new fund.

09:28.733 --> 09:31.233
To buy the Peel Company?

09:31.267 --> 09:33.667
I think it's safe to assume.

09:33.700 --> 09:35.833
I would have thought
Villanelle's employers

09:35.867 --> 09:37.633
wanted in on this
as much as anyone.

09:37.667 --> 09:39.067
You think she did this?

09:39.100 --> 09:42.467
I don't know. Is this supposed
to look like an accident?

09:42.500 --> 09:44.233
It's not really
Villanelle's style.

09:44.267 --> 09:47.133
- What about The Ghost?
- Maybe they work together.

09:47.167 --> 09:48.267

Then we're looking at two
different organizations.

he'd pay for anything I wanted.

to help in any way.

to being above the government.

Sorry, I'm an idiot.

15:06.433 --> 15:08.133
It's fine, it's nothing.

15:08.167 --> 15:11.800
Some kid is prank-calling the
school, making mad complaints.

15:11.833 --> 15:13.800
I didn't want you
to worry about it.

15:13.833 --> 15:15.500
Oh, okay.

15:15.533 --> 15:18.167
Well, it's part of being
a teacher, I guess.

15:18.200 --> 15:20.067
Exactly.
[Laughs nervously]

15:29.333 --> 15:31.000
Oh. Oh, dear. I erm...

15:31.033 --> 15:34.633
I better go and save Emma
from bad-breath Alan.

15:34.667 --> 15:37.333
The last thing she needs is
to accidentally sleep with him!

15:37.367 --> 15:39.667
- Again!
- [Nervous laughter]

15:39.700 --> 15:41.567
It was great to meet you.

15:45.833 --> 15:48.033
What?

15:48.067 --> 15:50.533
Someone wants a piece
of Mr. Polastri.

15:50.567 --> 15:54.233
Don't be ridiculous! Gemma?
She's just being nice.

15:54.267 --> 15:55.967
She wants to go to town on you!

15:56.000 --> 15:57.200
No!

15:57.233 --> 16:00.200
She was nice to you too. She
said the thing about the hair.

16:00.233 --> 16:02.200
And the dress.

16:02.233 --> 16:05.867
Oh, yeah. I noticed the
avalanche of compliments.

16:14.533 --> 16:16.733
Why don't you show me
your classroom...

16:16.767 --> 16:18.067

[Door slides open]

Hi.

16:29.833 --> 16:31.167
Oh.

16:31.200 --> 16:33.533
Hey, can I bum one?

16:33.567 --> 16:35.433
Oh, erm... Yeah, sure.

16:36.567 --> 16:37.733
Thanks.

16:37.767 --> 16:39.900
I'm Kim. Thanks.

16:48.100 --> 16:50.033
[Exhales noisily]

16:51.767 --> 16:54.233
Is that your boyfriend,
the Maths teacher?

16:54.267 --> 16:56.200
He seems nice.

16:56.233 --> 16:58.133
Niko? Erm...no.

16:58.167 --> 17:00.067
He's not my boyfriend.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.067
Oh, sorry!

17:02.100 --> 17:04.400
I thought you two were
together. You seemed...

17:04.433 --> 17:06.600
No. He's married.

17:07.167 --> 17:08.333
Sadly.

17:11.767 --> 17:13.867
Yeah. It sucks.

17:15.600 --> 17:17.900
Hm.

17:17.933 --> 17:19.867
I know exactly how you feel.

Which of your husbands
was this?

17:32.933 --> 17:34.567
My second...no, third.

17:34.600 --> 17:36.533
[Laughs]

17:40.933 --> 17:43.200
Oh!

17:43.233 --> 17:45.233
So for how long
are we going to do this?

17:46.433 --> 17:48.567
- What do you mean?
- This.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.533
Playing house.

17:51.933 --> 17:53.700
We can stop whenever you like.

17:53.733 --> 17:55.400
Hm?

17:55.433 --> 17:58.233
If you prefer to try your luck
until the next safe house

17:58.267 --> 17:59.867
becomes available, be my guest.

18:02.100 --> 18:03.667
Tell me where my family are.

18:04.867 --> 18:06.100
No.

18:08.400 --> 18:10.733
Please.

18:10.767 --> 18:12.667
You know
it would compromise them.

18:15.400 --> 18:18.567
What would you do if you could
never see Kenny again?

18:19.900 --> 18:21.000
I'd be fine.

18:22.433 --> 18:23.733
Liar!

18:23.767 --> 18:25.033
[He laughs]

18:25.067 --> 18:27.000
If I knew he was alright.

18:29.367 --> 18:32.700
But he still lives with you.
He works for you.

18:32.733 --> 18:36.033
- And you would be just fine?
- I would be.

18:36.067 --> 18:37.933
Because I've always
been careful.

18:40.733 --> 18:42.667
About loving your kid?

18:45.200 --> 18:46.767
Mm, yes.

18:53.267 --> 18:54.633
More wine.

18:54.667 --> 18:58.367
It's made by Sam Neill, of all
people, from New Zealand.

18:58.400 --> 19:00.367
You know, the film star,
"Jurassic Park".

19:00.400 --> 19:02.533
I know who he is.

19:04.433 --> 19:06.333
Please, I... I'd do it for you.

19:11.367 --> 19:13.233
Don't ask me again.

19:19.733 --> 19:22.233
I don't know why
they're even still married.

19:22.267 --> 19:24.167
His wife barely even
notices him.

19:26.267 --> 19:28.200
Do you think he likes you too?

19:28.233 --> 19:30.167
I don't know.

19:30.200 --> 19:31.633
Sometimes, maybe.

19:31.667 --> 19:34.467
Maybe he just needs
a little push.

19:34.500 --> 19:38.333
Squirt your perfume in his room
so it always smells like you.

19:38.367 --> 19:40.667
Flatter him,
make him doubt his wife.

19:42.033 --> 19:43.967
It sounds a bit manipulative.

19:44.000 --> 19:45.633
It is.

19:45.667 --> 19:48.700
That's why it works.

19:48.733 --> 19:50.900
You can do nothing
and die alone.

19:53.100 --> 19:55.000
Do you have cats?

19:56.567 --> 19:58.900
I have a cat, yes.

19:58.933 --> 20:00.533
Yeah.

just get another one.

Ooh, Maths!

get all hot and bothered.

20:31.167 --> 20:32.967
- Yeah?
- Mm-hm.

20:33.000 --> 20:34.500
You like Pythagoras?

[Laughs] Oh, my God,
Pythagoras!

20:37.833 --> 20:40.833
Oh, he's the sexiest!

I'm more of
a Newton man myself.

through that hair all day!

What is that?

21:02.033 --> 21:03.900
That is an apple, Eve.

21:03.933 --> 21:07.033
I know what an apple is.
How did it get here?

21:07.067 --> 21:09.833
I don't know. I brought it
from the canteen, I guess.

21:12.033 --> 21:13.600
Is everything okay?

21:17.400 --> 21:19.000

Eve?

21:42.833 --> 21:44.867
Do you think
there's a possibility...

21:44.900 --> 21:47.867
just a slight possibility
that you just saw an apple?

21:47.900 --> 21:49.767
[Alarm blaring]

21:52.333 --> 21:54.200
What if it was just an apple?

21:55.400 --> 21:57.333
Then... Then I would ask you...

21:57.367 --> 22:00.833
why the one time you came
to support me and my job,

22:00.867 --> 22:02.833
you were able
to miraculously somehow

22:02.867 --> 22:04.800
make it about you and your job.

You don't want to be here.

22:19.233 --> 22:21.200
And actually,
I don't really want you here.

32:22.933 --> 32:26.000
With my contacts,
you'll be your own boss.

32:26.033 --> 32:27.633
You would be my pimp.

32:27.667 --> 32:29.533
[Scoffs] Not your pimp.

Your partner.

32:31.700 --> 32:34.233
50-50?

32:34.267 --> 32:36.467
Or you could get strangled
by Raymond.

32:36.500 --> 32:39.533
Or shot by armed police.

She's behind that door!

No, I don't think so. Do you?

35:56.333 --> 35:57.600
No.

36:01.900 --> 36:04.933
Will you make sure that
"Pointless" is recorded, Kenny?

36:15.200 --> 36:18.300
I don't normally get angry,
Eve, it makes me feel sleepy.

36:18.333 --> 36:21.400
So you'll just have to imagine
I sound angry when I say this.

36:25.100 --> 36:29.400
Never ever go behind
my back again ever.

36:29.433 --> 36:32.000
You are by no means
the only person I work with

36:32.033 --> 36:36.233
but take up a disproportionate
amount of my time.

36:36.267 --> 36:39.700
And my time
is very valuable to me.

36:42.033 --> 36:43.900
I have hobbies.

Do you understand that, Eve?

Yes.

Kenny, I'm so sorry.

37:36.900 --> 37:38.833
I thought you were different.

37:39.900 --> 37:41.700
From Mum and the others.

37:41.733 --> 37:44.533
I am!

37:44.567 --> 37:46.700
Kenny, I am not doing this
for myself.

37:46.733 --> 37:48.600
I'm doing this
because it's our...

She's more interested
in this new woman.

No, she isn't.
