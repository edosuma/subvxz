WEBVTT

02:13.008 --> 02:14.009
You're in my way.

02:14.092 --> 02:16.220
I know you're angry.
That's why I wanted to talk to you.

02:16.303 --> 02:18.180
-You're not gonna fix this.
-You're right.

02:18.263 --> 02:21.892
But I better tell you something now
because you're already angry,

02:21.975 --> 02:24.061
and I want you to know this
right from the outset.

02:24.144 --> 02:25.479
No secrets here.

02:25.562 --> 02:26.563
Yep, no secrets.

02:26.647 --> 02:28.315
I think you'll be happy
about it eventually.

02:28.398 --> 02:30.275
It's gonna be good for you
and good for the show.

02:30.359 --> 02:33.987
I reached out to Alex to coanchor
with you, and she wants to do it.

02:34.071 --> 02:36.823
We're gonna hammer out a deal
and get her on air as soon as possible.

02:37.950 --> 02:38.951
I see.

02:44.581 --> 02:45.582
That's it.

02:46.083 --> 02:47.876
Go upstairs and get some rest.

02:48.752 --> 02:49.962
You did an amazing job tonight

02:50.045 --> 02:52.756
conducting this televised symphony
of drunks.

02:52.840 --> 02:54.299
Don't worry. It's all gonna work out.

02:55.384 --> 02:56.969
-What?
-It's gonna work out.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.887
Don't tell me it's gonna work out.

02:59.555 --> 03:02.057
You've lied to me enough.
You know, it's funny.

03:02.140 --> 03:04.393
Life just turns out
to be a series of disappointments

03:04.476 --> 03:07.813
with just enough time in between them
for the next one to catch you by surprise.

03:07.896 --> 03:10.190
I'm your boss.
I'm gonna make sure it works out.

03:10.274 --> 03:12.985
You're my boss?
I thought you were my friend.

03:13.068 --> 03:14.069
Well, fuck you.

03:17.739 --> 03:19.992
You know,
I think I'm coming down with something.

03:20.075 --> 03:24.329
Standing out all night in the cold,
doing this stupid job for you.

03:24.413 --> 03:26.582
I don't think I'm gonna make it
in the morning.

04:45.577 --> 04:46.620
Fuck.

05:25.409 --> 05:26.410
Okay.

05:57.357 --> 06:00.194
Godspeed privately arbitrating
a wrongful-death allegation

06:00.277 --> 06:01.278
based in sexual assault.

06:01.361 --> 06:03.447
It's a PR issue
as much as it's a legal issue.

06:03.530 --> 06:05.115
-I promise you that.
-Look. Hey.

06:05.199 --> 06:07.826
There's no way Shoenfeld's father's
gonna wanna take this to trial.

06:07.910 --> 06:09.411
Okay, so let's talk settlement.

06:09.494 --> 06:11.455
They're reaching with all this crap.

06:11.538 --> 06:15.667
Negligent hiring, negligent retention,
negligent supervision, duty to rescue.

06:15.751 --> 06:17.669
Cory, help me out here.

06:17.753 --> 06:20.756
Their lawyer's in over her head
with all this.

06:20.839 --> 06:22.883
-We'll put the fear of God into them.
-End it.

06:23.509 --> 06:24.968
Give 'em whatever they want. Pay 'em.

06:25.052 --> 06:26.845
We can't undo any of it,
so make it go away.

06:26.929 --> 06:28.263
The press is killing us.

06:28.347 --> 06:31.016
All the stuff with Ray,
Bradley not showing up, the stock price,

06:31.099 --> 06:32.518
the stink of Fred in the upholstery.

06:32.601 --> 06:35.187
There's an easy answer to this one.
Pay them and end it.

06:35.270 --> 06:37.356
We'll have to coordinate with Fred's
and Mitch's teams.

06:37.439 --> 06:39.358
They'll agree. We just need an NDA.

06:39.858 --> 06:42.319
You know,
I wouldn't normally give this advice,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.571
but things are so weird these days.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.658
Maybe we shouldn't have them sign an NDA.

06:47.741 --> 06:49.326
The bad actors are all gone, anyway.

06:49.409 --> 06:51.453
And it just makes things sound
worse than they are.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.998
How much worse can they be?

06:55.082 --> 06:57.167
Look. It's a terrible thing, but--

06:57.668 --> 07:01.713
And I hate to say this, there's a kind of
a built-in NDA anyway.

07:02.297 --> 07:03.298
Pardon?

07:04.049 --> 07:05.551
I mean…

07:06.927 --> 07:08.178
She's not talking.

07:19.815 --> 07:22.651
That's it. Turn out the lights.
The party's over. You're fired, Richard.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.445
Go ahead. Get out. Vamoose.

07:25.529 --> 07:28.115
Skedaddle.
Got another meeting in a few minutes.

07:28.198 --> 07:31.118
He's the only one fired,
but I do need all of you to leave.

07:31.660 --> 07:33.161
Keep me updated on the settlement.

07:35.455 --> 07:39.543
And did he ever return?
No, he never returned

07:39.626 --> 07:42.171
His fate is still unlearned

07:53.557 --> 07:54.683
Well, let's just get in

07:54.766 --> 07:56.310
and out as quickly as possible.

07:56.393 --> 08:00.022
What does it matter if people see me?
I worked here for 15 years.

08:00.105 --> 08:02.941
I could just be stopping by
to say, "Hello."

08:03.025 --> 08:04.067
Yeah. Well, of course.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.195
It's just that the network is spending
a lot of money

08:06.278 --> 08:08.780
to make a big event
out of announcing your homecoming.

08:08.864 --> 08:10.616
And the deal's not done.

08:11.783 --> 08:14.119
Well, then get the deal done, Doug.

08:14.203 --> 08:17.247
I've waited for this
my entire career, okay?

08:17.331 --> 08:20.417
I would like to see my office
on the executive floor.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.127
This is not the anchor floor.

08:22.211 --> 08:25.130
This is where decisions get made.
I control my own fate.

08:25.214 --> 08:26.381
-Just around the corner.
-Okay.

08:26.465 --> 08:28.425
-Alex Levy.
-Just keep your head down.

08:28.509 --> 08:29.510
Hi.

08:30.093 --> 08:33.096
Well, Alex is just making the rounds,
saying hi to some old coworkers.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.264
-Like you, apparently.
-Yeah.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.683
No, I don't know her.
Thank you for what you did.

08:36.767 --> 08:37.851
It--

08:39.102 --> 08:40.562
Oh, my gosh.

08:40.645 --> 08:41.647
Stop it.

08:43.357 --> 08:45.359
Please. Thank you. Sweet.

08:47.110 --> 08:48.737
-Hi.
-You're a hero.

08:49.571 --> 08:50.739
Shut up, Doug.

08:54.618 --> 08:55.911
Oh, my gosh.

08:58.330 --> 08:59.873
-Hot damn.
-Oh, my God.

09:10.592 --> 09:13.345
Just because we chose
a subscription model for UBA+

09:13.428 --> 09:15.639
does not mean
there won't be opportunities.

09:15.722 --> 09:17.099
The game's changing.

09:17.182 --> 09:18.308
And that's what you do.

09:18.392 --> 09:21.728
I mean, Dorexer changed the game
in treating rheumatoid arthritis.

09:21.812 --> 09:24.982
My mom's got a spring in her step again.
Renewed vim and vigor.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.066
She's here.

09:27.109 --> 09:28.569
"Here" here? Did anybody see her?

09:28.652 --> 09:29.820
Guess we'll find out.

09:30.737 --> 09:32.906
I'm so sorry.
I'm gonna have to call you back.

09:33.407 --> 09:35.492
Cybil on two,
says it's urgent about Bradley.

09:35.576 --> 09:36.827
Man. She's blowing it.

09:36.910 --> 09:38.245
Yeah, Bradley's really pushing it.

09:38.328 --> 09:40.414
I'm talking about Alex.
Is the release ready to go out?

09:40.497 --> 09:43.083
We're gonna be ready for Monday.
Bradley better be game once press starts.

09:43.166 --> 09:44.960
The clock's ticking. Ticktock.

09:55.387 --> 09:57.389
Okay. Yeah, it's open.

09:59.349 --> 10:00.517
Alex Levy.

10:01.185 --> 10:02.060
Welcome back.

10:02.144 --> 10:04.062
-Hey, hey, hey.
-No, don't get up.

10:04.146 --> 10:06.273
Please. You look so comfortable.
You can get up, Doug.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.650
You know what? Floor's good.

10:09.318 --> 10:11.320
Please have a seat
if you can find a chair anywhere.

10:11.403 --> 10:12.738
Got one built right in.

10:14.072 --> 10:15.699
This, of course, is the new--

10:15.782 --> 10:19.077
well, new to you anyway--
President of UBA News, Stella Bak.

10:19.161 --> 10:21.955
Hi. Yeah, it's--
It's great to meet you in person.

10:22.039 --> 10:23.832
Oh, my God. You're a baby.

10:24.416 --> 10:26.752
That's a compliment.
I would kill for that skin.

10:26.835 --> 10:27.878
Thanks.

10:28.795 --> 10:31.048
I think we can all leave
with the flesh we came in.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.883
We just came by to say hi.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.886
And if I had known you were coming in,
I would've told you not to

10:35.969 --> 10:38.222
until we make the big announcement
that you're coming back.

10:38.305 --> 10:39.890
But I would have given you flowers.

10:39.973 --> 10:41.308
-Uh-huh. Well.
-You know what?

10:41.391 --> 10:44.937
Sorry about that. We know
that you want to announce Monday.

10:45.020 --> 10:48.524
But Alex is just so
just ready and raring to go

10:48.607 --> 10:50.943
that wild horses
wouldn't have kept her away.

10:51.026 --> 10:52.903
Oh, wow. Original.

10:52.986 --> 10:54.613
So you got some new thoughts

10:54.696 --> 10:56.740
about what Alex Levy in prime time
is gonna look like?

10:56.823 --> 10:59.076
We were just talking about that, actually.

10:59.159 --> 11:02.162
And we're kicking around some good ideas.

11:02.246 --> 11:03.247
Awesome.

11:03.330 --> 11:05.290
We really can't wait to hear them.

11:05.374 --> 11:07.251
They're very early stages. So, you know,

11:07.334 --> 11:09.628
we'll bring you the full pitch
when we're there.

11:09.711 --> 11:12.297
Killer. Okay. Producers?
What are you thinking?

11:12.381 --> 11:14.341
Let's close the deal first, huh?

11:14.424 --> 11:17.219
Oh, my God, Alex. Go down to the studio.
They put in a new kitchen.

11:17.302 --> 11:19.096
-Do not go to the studio.
-Yeah.

11:19.930 --> 11:21.473
-Don't go to the studio.
-I--

11:21.557 --> 11:23.976
-Excuse-- You're okay, Isabella.
-It's okay.

11:24.059 --> 11:25.269
-So sorry.
-It's fine.

11:25.352 --> 11:26.645
I think the thing is,

11:26.728 --> 11:28.438
if I can be honest, Alex,

11:28.522 --> 11:33.694
you are our one unqualified good thing
right now.

11:33.777 --> 11:38.156
When we announce your return,
it is going to be huge news.

11:38.240 --> 11:40.826
And that's gonna be a majorly good thing
for you, for me,

11:40.909 --> 11:44.121
the network and The Morning Show.
You're our returning hero.

11:44.204 --> 11:45.205
And we just don't wanna--

11:45.289 --> 11:48.208
We don't wanna blow the PR blitz
that's gonna start on Monday.

11:48.292 --> 11:50.043
Again, assuming we'll close.

11:50.127 --> 11:51.628
We're gonna close, Doug. Yeah.

11:51.712 --> 11:55.674
Wait, so should Bradley
and I meet to plan about this PR blitz?

12:00.012 --> 12:01.221
I mean, I know there's issues.

12:01.305 --> 12:03.140
No, we're just hammering out
some things with her.

12:03.223 --> 12:04.308
But it's gonna be fine.

12:04.391 --> 12:08.353
I think what might be good is if you
reached out to her and let her know

12:08.437 --> 12:11.440
that you're so excited to be back
in the Alex and Bradley business.

12:11.523 --> 12:13.275
Well, yeah. Is she excited?

12:13.358 --> 12:14.276
She's so excited.

12:15.861 --> 12:19.865
We just wanted to stop by and say hi.
So, hi.

12:20.574 --> 12:21.783
Say hi, Stella.

12:21.867 --> 12:23.243
-Hi.
-Hello.

12:23.869 --> 12:24.703
-Okay.
-You know what?

12:24.786 --> 12:26.997
I'll tell you what.
Why don't the three of us

12:27.080 --> 12:29.333
have dinner at my place together
tomorrow night?

12:29.416 --> 12:31.585
You know, and we'll talk about
what Alex Levy,

12:31.668 --> 12:33.879
her big return to The Morning Show
is gonna look like,

12:33.962 --> 12:36.882
and how we're gonna transfer you
to your new prime time show.

12:38.592 --> 12:41.220
Y-- I'd love to keep it intimate.
No offense, Doug.

12:41.929 --> 12:42.930
None taken, Cory.

12:43.722 --> 12:44.973
That's great. Works for me.

12:45.057 --> 12:45.891
-Good.
-Great.

12:45.974 --> 12:46.808
-Good? Good.
-Good.

12:46.892 --> 12:47.893
Great.

12:56.068 --> 12:56.985
Wow.

12:57.069 --> 12:58.070
Oh, wow.

12:58.153 --> 13:00.197
You could not have planned that
any better.

13:00.989 --> 13:03.325
All your hard work,
and then stepping away when you did,

13:03.408 --> 13:08.664
and it just put you in this plum position.
And it's brilliant.

13:11.124 --> 13:12.876
I was broken, Doug.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.337
Yeah.

13:16.547 --> 13:20.384
Well, at least it paid off. All right,
I'm gonna head down to business affairs.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.052
I will see you later. Mazel tov.

13:22.135 --> 13:23.220
Thank you. Wait, Doug.

13:23.303 --> 13:27.558
Did you happen to get your hands on
an advanced copy of Maggie Brener's book?

13:28.225 --> 13:30.477
Yeah, they're really keeping that thing
under lock and key.

13:30.561 --> 13:31.979
But you'll be fine.

13:32.729 --> 13:36.483
All right? And screw Maggie's book.
You got your own book.

13:36.984 --> 13:39.611
People want the truth, they can get it
straight from the horse's mouth.

13:39.695 --> 13:40.904
Right.

13:42.114 --> 13:43.448
Metaphorically speaking, of course.

13:50.080 --> 13:52.624
I'm aware that you didn't think
bringing Alex back was a good idea,

13:52.708 --> 13:55.335
but it is your job to make sure
that you're wrong about that.

13:55.419 --> 13:58.172
Alex is in the Alex business,
and so are we.

13:58.255 --> 13:59.256
Fine.

13:59.798 --> 14:02.259
But Bradley better get on board
in the next couple of days,

14:02.342 --> 14:04.553
or we got some hard decisions to make.

14:04.636 --> 14:05.637
Hard for you, at least.

14:07.764 --> 14:08.974
Yeah, I'll handle that.

14:09.057 --> 14:11.185
By the way,
we should also invite Mia to the dinner.

14:11.268 --> 14:14.646
-It's her show.
-Yeah, okay. But no one else.

14:15.147 --> 14:17.941
I wanna keep it intimate.
And these things have a way of growing.

14:20.110 --> 14:21.653
Cory's office just called.

14:21.737 --> 14:23.447
They want you to join
a dinner tomorrow night

14:23.530 --> 14:25.324
with him, Stella and Alex.

14:25.407 --> 14:27.951
Cory, Stella, Alex. Okay.
Have we heard from Bradley?

14:28.035 --> 14:28.994
We haven't.

14:30.954 --> 14:33.165
Okay. Well,
she should probably be at that dinner.

14:33.248 --> 14:36.210
So clear it with Cory's office first,
and then invite her.

14:36.293 --> 14:38.921
Okay. Does this mean she's feeling better?

14:39.880 --> 14:40.881
Guess we'll find out.

14:46.178 --> 14:47.429
That's a bullshit offer.

14:48.055 --> 14:49.598
They're not giving me anything.

14:49.681 --> 14:52.768
A 5% bump with incentives
is not a bullshit offer.

14:52.851 --> 14:54.811
That's basically inflation.

14:54.895 --> 14:55.896
A prime time special.

14:55.979 --> 14:58.273
That they're probably gonna air
opposite the Super Bowl.

14:58.357 --> 15:00.692
-Bigger wardrobe budget.
-That's for them.

15:00.776 --> 15:02.653
And they promised you a personal apology.

15:02.736 --> 15:04.279
That is not easy to get.

15:04.363 --> 15:08.033
That they negotiated with my agent?
Wow, that seems really sincere.

15:08.116 --> 15:11.787
Okay. If we can get what you want,
how soon you going back?

15:11.870 --> 15:14.248
I'm not going back until Eric's gone.

15:14.331 --> 15:16.375
-Bradley.
-Jeff.

15:16.959 --> 15:19.878
-I understand. They mistreated you.
-They didn't mistreat me.

15:19.962 --> 15:22.089
Mistreating is what assholes do to dogs.

15:22.172 --> 15:23.715
They hurt me.

15:23.799 --> 15:26.260
I worked every day, day in and day out.

15:26.343 --> 15:28.011
I gave them my whole life.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.013
I understand that you don't feel valued.

15:30.097 --> 15:33.267
But you being out like this
is making the network look foolish.

15:33.350 --> 15:34.351
They look foolish?

15:34.434 --> 15:35.727
They made me look foolish.

15:36.895 --> 15:38.105
Is this about Alex?

15:38.188 --> 15:40.858
Because it's understandable
you'd be apprehensive about going back.

15:40.941 --> 15:42.734
No, this isn't about Alex.

15:42.818 --> 15:46.530
This is about them
doing things behind my back.

15:48.532 --> 15:49.825
Okay. Either way,

15:49.908 --> 15:52.828
you're in a bit of a precarious position
to be asking more,

15:52.911 --> 15:55.914
what with the ratings situation
and the way you've been testing.

15:55.998 --> 15:58.125
Let's not blow it all up.

16:03.922 --> 16:05.007
I think you should get that.

16:06.133 --> 16:08.093
Is that your professional advice, Jeff?

16:13.515 --> 16:15.017
Clearly, this is not the best of times.

16:15.100 --> 16:17.936
So, let's just double back to this
a little bit later.

16:18.020 --> 16:21.523
No, no, no, no. You don't get to do
the whole condescending, paternal,

16:21.607 --> 16:23.025
"You're out of control" move.

16:23.609 --> 16:25.527
Let's not forget who pays who
in this room.

16:26.361 --> 16:27.613
Please have a seat.

16:29.656 --> 16:32.326
Now, I realize you've only been working
with me for eight months,

16:32.409 --> 16:34.536
and that you have
a long relationship with this network.

16:34.620 --> 16:36.371
I'm sure you golf
with all those motherfuckers.

16:36.455 --> 16:39.583
And I know you have other clients
that work there too.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.168
But I don't give a shit.

16:41.251 --> 16:43.086
They need me.

16:43.170 --> 16:44.838
The fact that they have not fired me,

16:44.922 --> 16:47.508
and I've been gone out sick
for three weeks,

16:47.591 --> 16:49.676
tells you everything you need to know.

16:50.344 --> 16:54.097
They have two reasons they cannot fire me.

16:54.181 --> 16:55.474
The first of all

16:55.557 --> 16:58.185
is they have a wrongful death lawsuit
hanging over their heads.

16:58.268 --> 17:00.896
And in case you forgot,
I was the whistleblower.

17:00.979 --> 17:03.649
Remember that?
It would make them look really awful.

17:03.732 --> 17:04.942
And second of all,

17:05.025 --> 17:07.277
they're about to roll out
a big announcement

17:07.361 --> 17:09.154
that Alex and Bradley are back.

17:09.238 --> 17:11.490
And I am Bradley.

17:21.541 --> 17:23.836
You know what?
I get to say when this meeting's over.

17:23.919 --> 17:24.920
This meeting's over.

17:26.463 --> 17:28.214
You can squeeze people
when you have leverage,

17:28.298 --> 17:29.299
but they're not gonna forget it.

17:29.383 --> 17:30.634
When they have the upper hand,

17:30.717 --> 17:32.928
-they will squeeze you back.
-Squeeze this, Jeff.

17:34.263 --> 17:35.722
Give her a minute. She'll be back.

17:40.102 --> 17:41.728
-What?
-It's RJ.

17:43.230 --> 17:44.731
-Hey.
-Okay.

17:44.815 --> 17:46.692
Well, I hope you're feeling better.

17:46.775 --> 17:48.193
Yeah, yeah. What's going on?

17:48.735 --> 17:51.905
You got an invitation to dinner
tomorrow night at Cory Ellison's.

17:51.989 --> 17:53.198
Cory's? Why?

17:53.282 --> 17:54.783
They didn't say why exactly.

17:54.867 --> 17:59.872
I know Alex Levy is supposed to be there.
It's her, Stella, Mia and Cory.

18:02.040 --> 18:03.375
Okay, I'll go if I'm feeling better.

18:03.458 --> 18:05.919
But they need to invite Daniel and Alison.
Everybody.

18:06.003 --> 18:08.463
All the anchors.
'Cause they have to be inclusive.

18:08.547 --> 18:10.632
Okay. I'll talk to Cory's office.

18:11.508 --> 18:14.386
Do you think you might be
feeling better tomorrow?

18:14.970 --> 18:16.138
I might have to be.

18:16.889 --> 18:17.890
Thanks, RJ.

18:28.108 --> 18:29.234
Oh, shoot.

18:30.485 --> 18:33.197
Damn it. Damn it.

18:34.364 --> 18:35.490
Oh, well.

19:26.875 --> 19:27.876
Hey!

19:28.836 --> 19:31.797
-Alex? What are you doing here?
-I'm not here. I'm not here.

19:34.007 --> 19:35.008
Oh, God.

19:35.092 --> 19:36.260
Sorry. Excuse me.

19:38.095 --> 19:39.221
I'm sorry.

19:39.304 --> 19:40.806
-Alex? You're back?
-Hi.

19:45.394 --> 19:46.520
Sorry. Excuse me.

19:56.321 --> 19:57.239
Oh, God.

19:57.322 --> 19:59.533
-Of all the dressing rooms…
-Oh, geez. Oh, my God.

19:59.616 --> 20:01.660
…in all the world. Alex Levy.

20:01.743 --> 20:04.121
No, I'm-- This is your dressing room.

20:04.204 --> 20:06.832
I'm so sorry. Old habits.

20:06.915 --> 20:08.959
No, no, no.
I was just keeping it warm for you.

20:09.042 --> 20:10.586
It is the least I can do for a legend.

20:11.170 --> 20:12.462
I would not call me a legend.

20:12.546 --> 20:14.131
But I am going to retreat to the hallway.

20:14.214 --> 20:15.632
You'll never know I was in here.

20:15.716 --> 20:17.968
-I apologize. Back to the hallway--
-No. You gotta stay.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.344
Just for a minute. Please?

20:19.428 --> 20:21.555
This is a big deal for me. I insist.

20:21.638 --> 20:23.515
-Yes.
-Chair's the same.

20:23.599 --> 20:26.560
-Wi-Fi password, same.
-Okay, I'll stay a minute. Sure.

20:31.648 --> 20:34.610
Oh, wow. My-- Yes.

20:34.693 --> 20:37.112
Congratulations on evenings.

20:37.196 --> 20:38.822
Thank you. What about you?

20:38.906 --> 20:41.408
How does it feel to be reuniting
with Bradley Jackson?

20:44.119 --> 20:47.122
Geez. No one is supposed to know that.

20:48.248 --> 20:49.249
Most people don't.

20:50.876 --> 20:53.212
I guess you and Bradley
didn't exactly end on good terms.

20:56.798 --> 20:57.925
Did she tell you that?

20:58.008 --> 20:59.885
No, it's just the sense that I got.

21:02.930 --> 21:04.097
Yeah. No, we're good.

21:04.723 --> 21:07.601
Look, I'm probably just projecting here,

21:07.684 --> 21:11.146
but I'm not sure
she's ever gonna talk to me again.

21:12.606 --> 21:14.733
I don't suppose you have
any advice on that front?

21:17.444 --> 21:21.907
Yeah, I'm gonna think you would
know more about that than I would.

21:21.990 --> 21:24.493
Yeah, well, she makes it
sort of hard to be her friend.

21:24.576 --> 21:25.994
It's damn near impossible.

21:26.078 --> 21:27.246
Oh, my God. You know what?

21:27.329 --> 21:29.373
I don't know who the hell
you think you're talking to,

21:29.456 --> 21:32.459
but I would learn to keep
a thought like that to yourself.

21:33.043 --> 21:34.378
Bradley and I are not close,

21:34.461 --> 21:37.381
but we worked together
for all of three weeks.

21:37.464 --> 21:40.926
Probably the three most difficult weeks
of our entire lives.

21:41.009 --> 21:42.010
Which I'm sure you know

21:42.094 --> 21:44.179
because I'm sure Bradley
would've shared that with you.

21:44.263 --> 21:45.556
That's what friends do.

21:46.139 --> 21:48.475
You've worked with Bradley for six months?

21:48.559 --> 21:51.270
If you guys aren't friends yet, I--

21:51.353 --> 21:53.105
The problem here most likely is you.

21:54.273 --> 21:56.108
I hope you enjoyed meeting me.

22:13.125 --> 22:14.418
What are you still doing here?

22:16.628 --> 22:18.005
Things were supposed to get better.

22:19.047 --> 22:20.132
Well, some things have.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.011
Is this about Alex?

22:28.807 --> 22:34.229
Hey, did you see that someone in the US
has this novel coronavirus in Washington?

22:34.313 --> 22:36.940
And now they're admitting
that it can be transmitted

22:37.024 --> 22:38.483
-person-to-person.
-Yeah, I saw that.

22:38.567 --> 22:40.986
-How much time are we giving it tomorrow?
-A minute.

22:41.069 --> 22:43.822
But you try finding the time between
a bunch of septuagenarian millionaires

22:43.906 --> 22:46.450
and billionaires fighting over
who's gonna lead us into the future,

22:46.533 --> 22:48.702
Harry and Meghan renouncing the throne,

22:48.785 --> 22:50.787
the president of the United States
being impeached.

22:50.871 --> 22:51.955
How about Monday then?

22:52.039 --> 22:53.582
I don't know yet. It's MLK Day.

22:53.665 --> 22:56.168
We got that Michael Eric Dyson interview.

22:56.251 --> 22:59.004
Look, I get it. The whole world is sick.

22:59.087 --> 23:01.006
Some people are just worse off
than others.

23:01.089 --> 23:02.799
The information's out there
for anyone who cares to look.

23:06.887 --> 23:08.931
You going to that dinner
tomorrow night though, right?

23:09.014 --> 23:10.933
-Do I have a choice?
-No.

23:13.977 --> 23:15.395
Wouldn't miss it.

23:36.041 --> 23:37.042
This is not okay.

23:38.836 --> 23:39.837
I'm sorry?

23:39.920 --> 23:41.547
You think you can just pull that shit,

23:41.630 --> 23:45.050
fly halfway across the world
and invade my favorite fucking gelateria?

23:45.133 --> 23:49.346
I'm sorry. Could you
just maybe keep your voice down?

23:49.429 --> 23:51.807
No, I will not lower my voice.

23:51.890 --> 23:53.225
This man wants me to shut up.

23:53.976 --> 23:56.395
Well, I'm sorry your fragile,
straight white male ego

23:56.478 --> 23:59.982
can't handle someone
eviscerating it with the truth.

24:00.065 --> 24:02.609
-Pathetic.
-No. I'm not asking you to shut up.

24:02.693 --> 24:06.989
I was just asking you to talk directly
to me in a normal tone of voice

24:07.072 --> 24:09.783
so we don't spoil everybody else's gelato.

24:09.867 --> 24:12.536
Well, you spoiled my gelato.

24:14.288 --> 24:15.455
Go away.

24:15.539 --> 24:17.124
Like "away" away.

24:17.207 --> 24:19.168
Stop harassing this man, will you?

24:20.294 --> 24:22.004
-You don't have to go.
-Excuse me.

24:22.087 --> 24:24.965
If you had any idea who this scumbag was,
you'd understand.

24:25.048 --> 24:28.218
You mean, if I knew this was Mitch Kessler
from The Morning Show,

24:28.302 --> 24:30.596
I would agree he shouldn't have the nerve

24:30.679 --> 24:33.432
to breathe the same air
as someone like you,

24:33.515 --> 24:37.269
who I'm sure has done so much
for the world in her 20 long years?

24:37.352 --> 24:38.520
Okay. I get it.

24:38.604 --> 24:40.856
Well, I'm sorry I have some self-respect

24:40.939 --> 24:44.484
and I'm not just gonna put up
with entitled male behavior anymore.

24:44.568 --> 24:46.695
It's called feminism. Look it up.

24:46.778 --> 24:50.574
Would it say, "Feminism is whining
and throwing tantrums

24:50.657 --> 24:53.202
until you don't have to feel
uncomfortable anymore"?

24:53.285 --> 24:56.455
Because your comfort is
the most important thing in the universe?

24:56.538 --> 24:59.917
Your constant, all-day, everyday comfort

25:00.000 --> 25:05.088
is what we should all be bending down
and grab our ankles to accomplish.

25:05.172 --> 25:06.632
That's what it is?

25:06.715 --> 25:09.218
He's right here, eating his gelato.

25:09.301 --> 25:13.013
I didn't see him coming
and try to grab you by your pussy.

25:13.597 --> 25:15.557
-Then you would have a complaint.
-Okay.

25:15.641 --> 25:17.809
Or does kicking this guy when he's down

25:17.893 --> 25:20.854
makes you feel better about your sad,
miserable life?

25:20.938 --> 25:23.941
-I think this is about you.
-Yeah. Okay, Mussolini. That's enough.

25:24.024 --> 25:26.068
The world has passed you by.

25:26.151 --> 25:28.654
-Ha! Mussolini. Yeah!
-Okay. You know what?

25:28.737 --> 25:30.239
Thank you for your help.

25:30.322 --> 25:33.075
-But I actually have to go home.
-You have nowhere to be.

25:33.158 --> 25:34.159
Stay.

25:34.243 --> 25:37.246
I want to talk to you all about my friend,
Mussolini.

25:55.347 --> 25:56.348
Look what you've done.

25:56.431 --> 25:58.141
You've scared off the celebrity.

25:59.810 --> 26:02.729
And what about your friend over there?
Did she get all that?

26:02.813 --> 26:05.274
-My friend?
-Yeah, your friend over there

26:05.357 --> 26:09.820
who you had filming this whole thing
to post on social media.

26:09.903 --> 26:11.029
I'm sorry.

26:11.113 --> 26:15.826
I hope I didn't spoil your 15 minutes
as an Instagram feminist hero.

26:16.326 --> 26:17.327
And by the way,

26:17.411 --> 26:21.832
I fought for your right to be an asshole,
bitch. Don't make me regret it.

26:31.800 --> 26:32.926
Grazie.

26:34.845 --> 26:36.889
No, the grazie is all yours.

26:36.972 --> 26:39.016
-Paola Lambruschini.
-Mitch Kessler.

26:39.099 --> 26:41.435
Thank you for trying to help back there.

26:41.518 --> 26:42.519
I enjoyed it.

26:42.603 --> 26:44.771
Remember when getting angry was fun?

26:45.522 --> 26:46.523
Vaguely.

26:46.607 --> 26:49.067
Nowadays,
people get so angry when they're angry.

26:51.653 --> 26:54.990
Not to criticize,
but isn't it generally frowned upon

26:55.073 --> 26:57.284
to sing about Mussolini
on the streets of Italy?

26:57.367 --> 26:59.203
I frown upon Americans

26:59.286 --> 27:01.955
who call anything Italian
they don't like "Mussolini."

27:02.831 --> 27:05.834
Those two will dine out on that story
for the rest of their lives.

27:05.918 --> 27:10.672
The crazy, backwards Italian woman
and the famous American scofflaw.

27:10.756 --> 27:12.925
I think they would call me
something worse than a scofflaw.

27:13.008 --> 27:14.009
Well, sure.

27:14.092 --> 27:18.597
But we can't live our lives worrying
about what children think of us.

27:18.680 --> 27:21.808
That girl was just smart enough
to be stupid.

27:21.892 --> 27:23.685
She doesn't know what she wants from you.

27:24.311 --> 27:27.064
If you apologize, she says it's insincere.

27:27.564 --> 27:31.276
If you try to do good for the world,
it's self-serving.

27:31.360 --> 27:34.863
If you dare live your life, "the gall."

27:34.947 --> 27:38.659
If you choose to die,
then you're taking the coward's way out.

27:38.742 --> 27:41.203
You must live and suffer.

27:41.286 --> 27:44.665
But you mustn't do it in front of us,
and you mustn't try to learn from it.

27:46.041 --> 27:47.376
I just wanted some gelato.

27:47.459 --> 27:51.588
I guess there's no place
that's a safe space from safe spaces.

27:53.048 --> 27:54.842
Aren't you gonna ask me why I did that?

27:54.925 --> 27:57.344
-No. I wasn't planning on it.
-Why not?

27:57.427 --> 28:02.641
Because--
Because every version of that answer

28:02.724 --> 28:05.519
is some subset of "You're crazy."

28:06.728 --> 28:09.731
Finally being crazy is paying off.

28:09.815 --> 28:11.149
How's that?

28:11.233 --> 28:14.862
Well, I don't meet other people
in the media very often.

28:14.945 --> 28:16.238
I'm not really in the media.

28:16.321 --> 28:18.156
No, me neither. I'm taking a little break.

28:18.240 --> 28:19.241
As am I.

28:19.324 --> 28:21.535
I was hoping to pick your brain.

28:23.787 --> 28:27.332
-I actually need to get home right now.
-It doesn't have to be now.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.627
It's not a good idea. Sorry.

28:31.128 --> 28:32.838
That's how you repay me for helping you?

28:32.921 --> 28:35.048
All due respect,
I didn't ask for your help.

28:35.132 --> 28:37.551
You have to pay tax
when you win the lottery.

28:39.428 --> 28:41.555
Come on.
I'm just trying to pick your brain.

28:41.638 --> 28:45.726
-Come on. I just wanna pick your brain.
-Okay, fine. Yes. Yes. Yes.

28:46.226 --> 28:48.478
You can pick my brain at some future date.

28:48.562 --> 28:49.563
Okay.

28:51.064 --> 28:52.774
Put your number on my phone

28:52.858 --> 28:55.027
so we can set a date.

28:55.110 --> 28:57.154
You know, I'm gonna call that number

28:57.237 --> 28:58.238
-as soon as--
-No, no.

28:58.322 --> 29:00.157
That's my real number. You can call me.

29:17.841 --> 29:19.218
What the f--

29:21.970 --> 29:22.971
Bradley?

29:23.055 --> 29:26.266
Chip. It's a blast from your past.

29:26.350 --> 29:27.392
Yeah.

29:27.476 --> 29:29.770
What, are you calling me
from your hospital bed?

29:30.270 --> 29:32.064
Oh, my God. How'd you hear about that?

29:32.564 --> 29:35.400
Well, I run a news program,
and you are the news.

29:35.484 --> 29:37.194
That place is insane, Chip.

29:37.277 --> 29:38.445
I thought I might miss it.

29:38.529 --> 29:42.491
But the 17 years that I've been gone
have been some of the happiest in my life.

29:42.574 --> 29:43.867
So life goes on?

29:43.951 --> 29:45.786
That's the part they don't tell you,
you know?

29:45.869 --> 29:49.289
It's like they don't want you to know
life can be simple and normal.

29:49.373 --> 29:53.919
My job is manageable,
I actually have a life,

29:54.002 --> 29:57.256
and I'm engaged.

29:57.339 --> 30:00.342
Wait, what? Congratulations.

30:00.425 --> 30:03.470
I don't know what to say. She's amazing.

30:03.554 --> 30:06.056
I mean, it sounds corny,

30:06.139 --> 30:10.519
but she's genuinely helping me
become the person I always wanted to be,

30:10.602 --> 30:13.647
and I'm happy.

30:13.730 --> 30:15.399
That's great.

30:15.482 --> 30:17.734
What's going on with you?
I mean, besides the obvious.

30:17.818 --> 30:21.947
Have you done anything interesting
with your sort of downtime?

30:22.030 --> 30:23.156
Not really.

30:23.907 --> 30:26.535
I mean, I guess I went to get
ice cream yesterday.

30:26.618 --> 30:27.786
Well, that's cool.

30:28.287 --> 30:31.039
Anyway, the reason I'm calling you

30:32.457 --> 30:34.418
is they're making
a deal to bring Alex back.

30:35.002 --> 30:36.170
What?

30:39.089 --> 30:40.549
I see. Wow. Okay.

30:41.049 --> 30:44.845
And from my understanding,
they're giving her everything she wants.

30:45.929 --> 30:48.223
-How do you feel about that?
-Well, not great.

30:48.724 --> 30:51.852
And I feel really shitty
for not feeling great.

30:51.935 --> 30:53.353
Like I failed somehow,

30:53.437 --> 30:55.981
and they're bringing in my big sister
to clean up my fucking mess.

30:56.064 --> 30:57.065
That's not on you, though.

30:57.149 --> 30:58.942
You know UBA's been
a shit show for a while.

30:59.526 --> 31:03.447
Yeah, but… Just, you know,
you know Alex better than anybody,

31:03.530 --> 31:07.409
and I feel like maybe you could
give me some insight.

31:07.492 --> 31:09.369
I feel like I just don't know her at all.

31:09.453 --> 31:11.705
Like sometimes she's so open.

31:11.788 --> 31:14.041
And then other times,
she's just completely shut off.

31:14.124 --> 31:18.378
And I would just-- I don't know,
what is she like under all that?

31:18.462 --> 31:21.006
I mean, wouldn't that be nice to know?
You know?

31:23.133 --> 31:26.470
So, anything about Alex?

31:31.642 --> 31:33.060
I don't-- I mean,

31:33.143 --> 31:36.313
I guess the one thing I would say
is you have to watch out for her.

31:37.356 --> 31:39.858
You know,
she can make you feel like you are

31:39.942 --> 31:42.152
the most important thing in the universe.

31:42.236 --> 31:44.238
So connected.

31:44.321 --> 31:45.405
And then you turn,

31:45.489 --> 31:49.701
and then she will push you
off of the cliff.

31:51.870 --> 31:55.040
And she will justify it in her head too.

31:55.541 --> 31:59.294
But she is in it for Alex.
Make no mistake.

31:59.795 --> 32:01.922
You know, everybody wants to win,
not everybody can win.

32:02.005 --> 32:03.006
It makes you competitive.

32:03.090 --> 32:04.883
I understand that.
But it's different with Alex.

32:05.968 --> 32:09.847
I mean, if I ever see her again,
and I'm not sure I will…

32:19.398 --> 32:21.733
I will have words for her.
Let me just say that.

32:25.028 --> 32:26.113
Yeah.

32:33.078 --> 32:34.538
-Welcome.
-I brought wine.

32:34.621 --> 32:37.583
Wine. I knew I forgot something.

32:38.584 --> 32:40.794
This place is amazing.

32:40.878 --> 32:42.880
-Hey there.
-Hi.

32:44.631 --> 32:46.592
-That together is really good.
-Yeah.

32:46.675 --> 32:48.427
-We gotta add it to the rounds. Hey.
-Yo.

32:49.261 --> 32:50.512
So, Alex Levy.

32:51.847 --> 32:53.599
Does she like to make people wait on her?

32:54.641 --> 32:57.895
You mean wait on her like a servant
or wait on her to arrive?

32:59.938 --> 33:02.316
Of course--
I mean, no. Look, Alex? She can be--

33:03.108 --> 33:04.651
-She can be a little bit-- No.
-Entitled.

33:04.735 --> 33:05.736
-No. No.
-Entitled? Really?

33:05.819 --> 33:07.112
-No. She's a straight shooter.
-Entitled.

33:07.196 --> 33:08.447
-No. She can be--
-Straight shooter.

33:08.530 --> 33:11.200
-She can be a little bit prickly.
-Stop that word two letters sooner.

33:12.576 --> 33:14.786
That's a little rough. Little rough.

33:14.870 --> 33:16.413
-It's the truth.
-I'll keep that in mind.

33:16.496 --> 33:18.081
How cool is it to live in a hotel, Cory?

33:18.165 --> 33:19.541
I hear the rates here are great.

33:19.625 --> 33:21.793
I would just want room service
to have the martinis handy.

33:21.877 --> 33:22.878
Okay.

33:22.961 --> 33:24.922
Shouldn't Bradley and Alex be here by now?

33:26.507 --> 33:27.508
Excuse me.

33:31.720 --> 33:33.222
Cybil. Sorry. Hey.

33:33.305 --> 33:36.016
I know we've been trading calls.
I apologize. How are you?

33:36.099 --> 33:37.351
I've been better.

33:37.434 --> 33:40.187
There are pictures in Page Six
of Bradley out getting ice cream.

33:40.270 --> 33:41.438
She doesn't look too sick.

33:41.522 --> 33:44.942
This is just embarrassing.
She's making us look like idiots.

33:45.025 --> 33:46.235
Well…

33:47.361 --> 33:49.738
Well, you can be sick and want ice cream.

33:49.821 --> 33:52.866
She couldn't be bothered to come in
for the better part of a month.

33:52.950 --> 33:56.662
And now she's parading around
like she hasn't a care in the world.

33:56.745 --> 33:58.455
Like she's footloose and fancy-free.

33:58.539 --> 34:01.583
Well, Cybil, maybe she was just--

34:01.667 --> 34:02.835
Whatever you're going to say,

34:02.918 --> 34:04.419
I don't exactly give a fuck.

34:04.503 --> 34:06.755
I know you don't want to get
into a pissing match with me.

34:06.839 --> 34:08.130
All I do is piss.

34:08.715 --> 34:09.842
Fire Bradley.

34:09.925 --> 34:12.344
I don't even know why we have to
have a conversation about it.

34:12.427 --> 34:13.679
Fire her.

34:16.473 --> 34:17.474
Okay.

34:32.697 --> 34:34.741
-Hey. Coming upstairs?
-Why?

34:34.824 --> 34:36.827
Because you were invited.
It's the right thing to do.

34:36.909 --> 34:38.704
What do you know
about the right thing to do?

34:38.786 --> 34:41.373
Looks like you were getting dressed.
So I'm gonna assume you were coming.

34:41.456 --> 34:43.583
-Were you getting dressed?
-You're not allowed to know that.

34:46.295 --> 34:47.795
Okay. Well, if you are getting dressed,

34:47.880 --> 34:49.672
then you need to put
your big-girl pants on.

34:49.755 --> 34:52.801
You think you're sticking it to everybody,
but you're only sticking it to yourself.

34:52.885 --> 34:56.013
'Cause at a certain point,
this is only going to hurt you.

34:56.096 --> 35:00.100
And also, I went through a lot of trouble
to get Alex back, in part, to help you.

35:00.184 --> 35:01.894
I know you don't believe that,
but it's true.

35:01.977 --> 35:06.106
And if you could just clear the smoke
from your angry, angry heart,

35:06.190 --> 35:08.442
you'd see that Alex coming back
is gonna be good for the show,

35:08.525 --> 35:10.861
good for ratings and good for you.

35:10.944 --> 35:12.821
Because it's gonna be
incredibly successful.

35:12.905 --> 35:14.489
And you're gonna be
a part of that success.

35:14.573 --> 35:16.241
That success is gonna
give you the green light

35:16.325 --> 35:17.868
to do all the things you wanted to do.

35:17.951 --> 35:21.622
Everything you've been asking for,
including covering your beloved hard news.

35:21.705 --> 35:24.750
I know you think I'm a bad guy,
and I know you don't trust me.

35:24.833 --> 35:26.835
But I am telling you right now,

35:27.920 --> 35:32.966
if you don't make this work for you,
you are only fucking yourself.

35:35.761 --> 35:38.847
Is this the personal apology
that my agent negotiated?

35:39.348 --> 35:40.349
'Cause it sucks.

35:44.061 --> 35:45.729
No.

35:48.440 --> 35:49.441
Bye, Bradley.

35:56.114 --> 35:58.033
I'm not so sure Bradley's gonna make it.

35:58.617 --> 35:59.868
What about Alex?

35:59.952 --> 36:02.329
I'm not worried about her.
She's just late.

36:05.290 --> 36:06.124
There she is.

36:08.961 --> 36:10.379
-Oh, my God.
-Yanko.

36:10.462 --> 36:11.713
-Oh, man.
-Hi.

36:11.797 --> 36:14.174
-It's so good to see you.
-So good to see you.

36:14.258 --> 36:15.884
-Hi.
-You look great. Everybody's in there.

36:15.968 --> 36:17.261
-Hello.
-Ma'am.

36:17.344 --> 36:19.763
Thank you very much. Thank you.

36:19.847 --> 36:20.848
Cory.

36:23.100 --> 36:24.726
I see it's very intimate.

36:24.810 --> 36:27.229
Yeah. You can't offend anyone anymore.

36:27.312 --> 36:29.398
-There she is.
-Hi, Alex!

36:29.481 --> 36:32.192
-Welcome back. Hi.
-Hi, Alison.

36:32.818 --> 36:34.278
So good to see you.

36:35.195 --> 36:37.030
-Hi, Stella. Hello.
-Hey.

36:37.114 --> 36:40.284
-It's good to have you back.
-It's so good to see you.

36:40.367 --> 36:41.368
Daniel.

36:41.451 --> 36:42.744
How have you been?

36:42.828 --> 36:45.455
You mean since you fucked me over?
I'm great.

36:47.791 --> 36:50.711
-Hello.
-And who are you?

36:50.794 --> 36:52.337
And how did you get in here?

36:52.421 --> 36:53.964
That's Ty Fitzgerald. He's on the show.

36:54.047 --> 36:55.382
I know who that is.

36:56.842 --> 36:57.843
You're terrific.

36:57.926 --> 36:59.720
I'm so looking forward to working
with you.

36:59.803 --> 37:02.347
Well, I'm really excited
to be worked with.

37:03.599 --> 37:05.100
-Worked with.
-Yes.

37:05.184 --> 37:07.769
-So it works out.
-Okay. Yes.

37:09.229 --> 37:10.230
Where's Bradley?

37:13.358 --> 37:14.359
Should we eat?

37:19.114 --> 37:20.574
Long time no see.

37:24.578 --> 37:25.579
Hey.

37:26.872 --> 37:29.708
Oh, Bradley. I'm so happy
to see you're feeling better.

37:29.791 --> 37:31.418
Do we have to keep pretending
she was sick?

37:31.502 --> 37:32.586
Dealer's choice.

37:32.669 --> 37:33.629
Yes. Thank you.

37:33.712 --> 37:34.796
-Alex.
-Hi.

37:34.880 --> 37:36.340
Wow.

37:36.423 --> 37:37.674
It's so good to see you.

37:37.758 --> 37:39.134
It is so good to see you too.

37:44.181 --> 37:46.517
Okay. Now, these are two people
who missed each other.

37:49.269 --> 37:52.397
The best friends together again.

37:52.481 --> 37:54.525
Talk amongst yourselves.
I'm gonna go check on dinner.

37:54.608 --> 37:55.609
It should be ready soon.

37:55.692 --> 37:57.194
-Your hair.
-Thank you. Yes.

37:57.277 --> 37:59.738
Good to see both of you.
Hope you're ready to get back to work.

37:59.821 --> 38:02.783
I'm so excited. I'm excited.
I'm getting ready to get ready.

38:02.866 --> 38:04.284
That's how it's--

38:06.078 --> 38:08.038
-I'll be right back.
-Yes, of course.

38:08.121 --> 38:10.082
-Hi.
-How are you doing?

38:10.165 --> 38:11.625
So, you're not sick anymore?

38:12.668 --> 38:13.794
I'm getting there.

38:14.795 --> 38:18.215
Glad to hear it.
Hope you didn't catch it from me.

38:19.716 --> 38:22.010
I don't know, but I'm gonna push through.

38:24.054 --> 38:25.055
Hey.

38:28.058 --> 38:30.769
I don't know what to say. That was awful.

38:32.145 --> 38:33.564
I'm a different person now.

38:33.647 --> 38:35.607
It doesn't matter the person you are.

38:35.691 --> 38:37.818
You're the person who fucked me over,
Alex.

38:38.569 --> 38:40.654
I turned down coanchor at YDA

38:40.737 --> 38:44.199
because we made an agreement
that suited you in the moment.

38:44.283 --> 38:46.660
I did not tell you to do that.
I didn't know that.

38:46.743 --> 38:48.287
Okay, what difference does that make?

38:48.370 --> 38:50.831
How does that make it any better
that the next morning,

38:50.914 --> 38:54.334
you decide to go on an impromptu crusade
with a woman that you were firing,

38:54.418 --> 38:57.379
and then suddenly she's not fired?
And then you quit.

38:57.462 --> 38:58.589
Would it have been better

38:58.672 --> 39:00.883
if I never told the truth
about Fred on air?

39:00.966 --> 39:02.092
Okay, it's not about that.

39:02.176 --> 39:03.844
I get why you did it.
I'm glad it got said.

39:04.511 --> 39:06.221
But I didn't need to become
collateral damage

39:06.305 --> 39:07.931
in order for it to happen.

39:08.015 --> 39:10.142
You could have done it
without offering me the job.

39:10.225 --> 39:13.353
Or you could have not needed
a really exemplary woman

39:13.437 --> 39:14.605
to die to wake you up.

39:24.531 --> 39:25.908
I'm really sorry, Daniel.

39:25.991 --> 39:27.326
Sorry is what people say

39:27.409 --> 39:29.661
when they want permission
to stop feeling bad.

39:29.745 --> 39:35.542
Anything I can do to help you
move forward, I will do it.

39:36.543 --> 39:38.795
You deserve better than you've gotten.

39:40.797 --> 39:42.090
But I can't turn back time.

39:43.467 --> 39:46.178
All I can do is promise
that I'll do better

39:46.261 --> 39:48.180
and tell you what's in my heart.

39:48.722 --> 39:52.142
And what's in my heart is that I am sorry.

39:54.895 --> 39:56.271
Apology not accepted.

39:56.855 --> 39:59.858
Yeah, I'll have another one.
Thank you. That's good.

39:59.942 --> 40:02.694
Dinner is ready.

40:02.778 --> 40:06.031
And you two are sitting together.

40:07.157 --> 40:08.200
Great.

40:13.622 --> 40:15.499
Please. It's like having the flu.

40:15.582 --> 40:17.209
Yeah. I don't want to get the flu either.

40:17.292 --> 40:19.419
I don't know.
I had SARS. It was wonderful.

40:19.503 --> 40:21.463
Hey,
I don't think we should joke about it.

40:22.005 --> 40:23.090
People are getting sick.

40:23.173 --> 40:25.217
People will get sick
whether we joke about it or not.

40:25.300 --> 40:27.427
And if a person gets coronavirus
5,000 miles away,

40:27.511 --> 40:28.929
-does it make a sound?
-I don't know.

40:29.012 --> 40:31.223
-I think Daniel's right.
-Someone should cover it.

40:32.057 --> 40:33.809
Well, then let's get you on a plane.

40:33.892 --> 40:36.144
Me? I'm going to Iowa.

40:36.228 --> 40:37.354
Well, Bradley's back.

40:37.437 --> 40:39.815
-She can do the caucus.
-Now you're volunteering me?

40:40.315 --> 40:42.651
You wouldn't want to cover
the caucus for some reason?

40:42.734 --> 40:43.986
No--

40:44.069 --> 40:47.781
Look, I'm not necessarily saying
that I need to cover coronavirus.

40:47.865 --> 40:51.201
I'm saying
that we should cover coronavirus.

40:51.285 --> 40:54.580
Well, watching a disease spread
isn't exactly exciting TV.

40:54.663 --> 40:56.915
You know what? There's a lot
going on, but Daniel is right.

40:56.999 --> 40:58.000
Let's figure it out.

40:58.083 --> 40:59.751
There is a lot going on.

40:59.835 --> 41:02.296
But maybe if we can get
this sham impeachment trial over with,

41:02.379 --> 41:04.089
we can actually clear up some screen time.

41:04.173 --> 41:05.674
Are you joking?

41:05.757 --> 41:07.676
-No. It's a sham.
-In what sense?

41:07.759 --> 41:09.928
You think Trump is innocent?

41:10.012 --> 41:12.472
That's not the point.
The point is that it's a charade.

41:15.767 --> 41:16.852
Everybody.

41:17.769 --> 41:18.812
I'm making a toast.

41:24.735 --> 41:27.196
-I wanna welcome back Alex Levy.
-Thank you, Cory.

41:27.279 --> 41:30.782
One of the most beloved, incisive,
radiant, groundbreaking journalists

41:30.866 --> 41:33.285
and television personalities
ever to grace the TV screen.

41:33.368 --> 41:34.369
-Come on.
-Sorry.

41:34.453 --> 41:35.954
I'm just so excited.

41:36.038 --> 41:37.331
I am really happy.

41:37.414 --> 41:38.582
These two women,

41:40.375 --> 41:43.587
they changed the course
of human history for the better.

41:44.213 --> 41:46.548
And we've got 'em.

41:47.925 --> 41:51.303
And we will be spending more than
the GDP of a small island nation

41:51.386 --> 41:54.348
to make sure everyone knows it,
I guarantee it.

41:54.431 --> 41:59.186
Everybody is going to be watching
Alex and Bradley week on UBA,

41:59.269 --> 42:02.814
culminating on a Sunday night prime time
retrospective of their time together

42:02.898 --> 42:04.650
we're calling the Three Weeks of Spring,

42:04.733 --> 42:07.486
which leads into
a UBA 365 interview special

42:07.569 --> 42:12.616
that puts each of you one-on-one
with the one, the only, Laura Peterson.

42:12.699 --> 42:18.205
And it all crescendos into a moment
the whole world will be watching,

42:18.288 --> 42:21.708
the moment our heroes reunite.

42:21.792 --> 42:25.546
Monday morning, 7:00 a.m., together on air
for the first time since that--

42:26.880 --> 42:29.550
that wonderful

42:29.633 --> 42:32.594
and shocking day nine months ago.

42:32.678 --> 42:34.304
So everyone, please,

42:34.388 --> 42:35.764
-let's raise a glass…
-Yeah.

42:35.848 --> 42:39.101
…and toast to Alex Levy
and Bradley Jackson.

42:39.184 --> 42:40.894
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

42:40.978 --> 42:42.729
-Cheers.
-Cheers.

42:45.774 --> 42:48.610
Hey there. Is everything okay?

42:50.612 --> 42:51.613
Okay?

42:53.115 --> 42:54.992
Yeah. Are you upset with me
for some reason?

42:56.952 --> 42:57.953
No, I'm good.

42:59.371 --> 43:01.123
Okay. Well, great.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.416
I was thinking,

43:02.499 --> 43:06.879
you and I, why don't we get together
and just sort of work on some ideas?

43:07.588 --> 43:09.131
Sure. Just call RJ.

43:10.257 --> 43:12.426
-Who's RJ?
-That's my assistant.

43:12.509 --> 43:14.511
I prefer to do my scheduling through him.

43:20.017 --> 43:21.268
Okay.

43:22.686 --> 43:23.687
Okay.

43:24.563 --> 43:25.689
Yeah.

43:27.733 --> 43:29.067
You're not leaving, are you?

43:30.235 --> 43:33.530
Listen, everyone.
I just want to say I had a great evening.

43:33.614 --> 43:36.867
I have a dog now.
So, I gotta go take him out for a walk.

43:37.743 --> 43:42.080
But I just wanted to say how great it was
to see all of you tonight.

43:43.582 --> 43:46.627
And I know I come
with a history attached to me.

43:46.710 --> 43:49.671
And it's not a history
that all of you love. I know that.

43:49.755 --> 43:52.299
But I left this job for a reason.

43:53.467 --> 43:56.136
And I've done a lot of work on myself.

43:56.887 --> 43:58.180
I've had a lot of therapy.

43:58.263 --> 44:02.226
Never intended on coming back
to this place, but you're--

44:03.519 --> 44:05.521
Truth is, I missed it,
and I missed it a lot.

44:05.604 --> 44:08.982
So, I want it.

44:09.608 --> 44:12.694
So let's focus on the future, huh?

44:12.778 --> 44:14.738
Right? Because I'm back.

44:15.405 --> 44:16.740
And I'm not going anywhere.

44:16.823 --> 44:19.368
So, just all have a good night, okay?

44:19.451 --> 44:20.619
Thanks for everything.

44:21.203 --> 44:22.204
Thank you.

44:25.791 --> 44:28.085
Bradley. Let's be smart about this.

44:28.168 --> 44:29.378
Get out of my way.

44:31.213 --> 44:32.548
Alex.

44:34.258 --> 44:38.345
Things are gonna have to be different
if we're gonna resume this "partnership."

44:38.428 --> 44:39.805
You need to know that.

44:41.807 --> 44:45.310
I would expect things to be different.
I've been gone for eight months.

44:45.394 --> 44:48.689
It's actually nine months.
And things have already changed.

44:48.772 --> 44:51.650
First of all, I really want this,
and I'm good at this.

44:51.733 --> 44:53.110
And I've been holding up this show

44:53.193 --> 44:54.987
ever since
you decided to erratically leave

44:55.070 --> 44:56.071
without telling me.

44:56.154 --> 44:58.699
I told you. I remember calling you.

44:58.782 --> 45:01.660
You called me
a week after you told the network.

45:02.244 --> 45:03.328
I'm sorry.

45:03.412 --> 45:06.123
I was having a meltdown.

45:06.206 --> 45:08.083
I'm sorry I didn't do it
in the perfect order.

45:08.166 --> 45:10.419
You talked to me for one fucking minute.

45:10.502 --> 45:12.171
The whole fucking world changed
in a minute.

45:12.254 --> 45:15.382
And then I got the whole responsibility
of the show dumped on my shoulders,

45:15.465 --> 45:17.259
and I'd only been doing it for a month.

45:17.342 --> 45:18.343
And you said,

45:18.427 --> 45:20.304
"I'm gonna check on you
and I'm gonna call you."

45:20.387 --> 45:22.681
And that is the last time
I fucking heard from you, buddy.

45:23.265 --> 45:25.392
Buddy? Okay, apologies.

45:27.603 --> 45:29.730
You know,
there are people with real problems.

45:30.856 --> 45:34.234
Like you have real fucking problems
in this world? I'm sorry.

45:34.318 --> 45:36.403
Not all of us get to run off
to a fucking country house

45:36.486 --> 45:37.571
when the going gets tough.

45:37.654 --> 45:40.073
Some of us had to sit in the shit
and deal with it.

45:40.157 --> 45:43.327
And, by the way,
Miss Feminist-fucking-hero,

45:43.410 --> 45:45.495
I was the one
who was exposing the network,

45:45.579 --> 45:47.915
and I decided to include you.

45:47.998 --> 45:50.375
And meanwhile, you were just
trying to get me fucking fired.

45:50.459 --> 45:52.169
Behind my back!

45:52.252 --> 45:54.254
Well, I'm really sorry I failed at that.

45:54.338 --> 45:56.507
Are we being honest with each other now?

45:56.590 --> 45:57.841
-Yeah, we're being honest!
-All right.

45:57.925 --> 45:59.885
When I came to this show,
I was a fucking baby.

45:59.968 --> 46:04.348
I did anything anybody wanted me to do
to just get along and make nice

46:04.431 --> 46:05.724
because I thought we were a team.

46:05.807 --> 46:07.476
We're not a fucking team.

46:07.559 --> 46:10.187
Every single person in there
is out for themselves.

46:10.687 --> 46:12.147
-So if we're gonna do this…
-Oh, God.

46:12.231 --> 46:15.108
…I want you to know
I'm not gonna be your fucking sidekick.

46:15.192 --> 46:16.193
I am your equal.

46:16.276 --> 46:17.819
And I'm gonna go toe-to-toe with you

46:17.903 --> 46:19.363
-for all the best stories…
-Great.

46:19.446 --> 46:21.073
…screen time, and I'm not rolling over.

46:21.156 --> 46:22.741
-I'm gonna compete with you.
-Do it!

46:22.824 --> 46:24.326
That's what you should do.

46:24.409 --> 46:27.663
Compete. Don't roll over.
You should never roll over.

46:28.163 --> 46:29.831
That's the job. Think you can do the job?

46:29.915 --> 46:31.875
-Can you even hear yourself?
-I can hear myself fine.

46:31.959 --> 46:34.211
You're taking what I said to you
and then turning it around,

46:34.294 --> 46:36.755
making it seem like you're telling me
what I said to you!

46:36.839 --> 46:38.715
Oh, my God, Bradley.

46:38.799 --> 46:44.054
Honestly, a friendship with you
sounds like a really bountiful journey.

46:44.137 --> 46:45.722
I'm sorry I didn't call you.

46:45.806 --> 46:49.393
We worked together for one month.
We don't owe each other a thing.

46:49.476 --> 46:50.769
Well, what about Chip?

46:52.354 --> 46:53.355
What about Chip?

46:53.438 --> 46:54.690
Do you owe him anything?

46:54.773 --> 46:56.316
'Cause I talked to him today,

46:56.400 --> 46:58.402
and he says he hasn't heard
from you either.

46:58.485 --> 47:01.446
And how long did you work together?
Fifteen years?

47:01.530 --> 47:03.574
Sounds like a great thing
to have a friendship with you.

47:03.657 --> 47:06.118
But congratulations on your megadeal,
Alex.

47:06.201 --> 47:07.578
I'm gonna go now, Bradley.

47:07.661 --> 47:09.371
Of course you are.
That's what you always do.

47:09.454 --> 47:10.539
The gloves are coming off.

47:10.622 --> 47:11.915
-Alex!
-I hear it. I got it.

48:00.589 --> 48:03.300
Give me paw. Give me your paw.

48:22.945 --> 48:23.987
Fuck off.

48:24.071 --> 48:25.656
-Jesus.
-I come in peace.

48:26.323 --> 48:29.618
-The network paid $119.2 million.
-Jesus.

48:29.701 --> 48:33.163
$119.2 million for you to go away.

48:33.247 --> 48:34.665
Well, it's a golden parachute.

48:34.748 --> 48:38.085
How much will it cost
for you to get off my fucking front step?

48:38.168 --> 48:40.128
Mitch, we need to talk. Mitch!

49:04.152 --> 49:05.153
Thank you.

49:07.406 --> 49:10.617
Your flight time
from New York City to Wuhan, China

49:10.701 --> 49:13.787
is 23 hours and 11 minutes.

49:15.414 --> 49:18.041
All right. As long as everybody
in the studio and everybody at home

49:18.125 --> 49:20.002
promises to turn around.

49:20.544 --> 49:23.422
All right, everybody? All right. Yeah.

49:33.348 --> 49:34.766
Mandy, Washington on one.

49:38.729 --> 49:40.647
So where are we? How much do they want?

49:40.731 --> 49:41.815
They won't settle.

49:41.899 --> 49:44.234
The dollar figure they gave
was so out of sight,

49:44.318 --> 49:46.111
they know we can't agree to it.

49:46.195 --> 49:49.198
119.2 million? It was so specific.

49:49.281 --> 49:51.116
They're clearly trying to send
some sort of message.

49:51.200 --> 49:52.910
But they want this to go to trial.

49:56.371 --> 49:58.123
Hey, have you seen my keys?

49:59.041 --> 50:01.877
Oh, my God. Where have my keys gone?

50:01.960 --> 50:03.754
-They were there.
-This is insane.

50:05.214 --> 50:07.341
I can drop you, but I'm late.

50:07.424 --> 50:09.635
-Did I leave them in my car? Oh, shit.
-Maybe.

50:11.595 --> 50:12.596
Alex.

50:15.015 --> 50:16.099
Hi.

50:18.352 --> 50:19.686
I saw Bradley last night.

50:21.647 --> 50:23.106
What did she s--

50:23.190 --> 50:25.359
I don't care about any of that stuff.
It's in the past.

50:25.442 --> 50:26.443
-No, no.
-The job--

50:26.527 --> 50:28.612
That's not why I'm here. I--

50:30.239 --> 50:32.407
I want you to come back to the show
and be my producer.

50:35.702 --> 50:36.870
It would mean the world to me.

50:58.267 --> 50:59.268
When do I start?
