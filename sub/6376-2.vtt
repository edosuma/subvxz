NO.
I'M A PRIVATE INVESTIGATOR.

09:44.375 --> 09:46.878
JONATHAN'S FAMILY IN MADRID
HIRED ME TO FIND HIM.

09:46.878 --> 09:49.297
WELL, WHY DIDN'T THEY
CALL THE POLICE?
THEY DID.

09:49.297 --> 09:52.550
BUT THE AMERICAN POLICE THINK
HE'S NO LONGER ON U. S. SOIL.

09:52.550 --> 09:56.096
HIS FAMILY SUSPECTS OTHERWISE.
THAT'S WHERE I COME IN.

09:56.096 --> 09:57.889
WELL, WHERE DO I COME IN?

09:57.889 --> 10:00.809
I'D LOVE TO GET A CHANCE TO ASK
YOUR DAUGHTER SOME QUESTIONS

10:00.809 --> 10:02.894
ABOUT WHEN SHE
LAST SAW JONATHAN.

10:02.894 --> 10:06.106
I'M NOT SURE
WE CAN BE OF ANY HELP.

10:06.106 --> 10:08.650
SHE HASN'T SEEN THAT BOY
IN QUITE A WHILE.

10:08.650 --> 10:11.277
YOU'D BE SURPRISED,
MS. SLATER.

10:11.277 --> 10:14.864
SOMETIMES THE SMALLEST DETAIL
CAN BLOW A CASE WIDE OPEN.

10:14.864 --> 10:17.534
SO HOW ABOUT TOMORROW?

10:24.958 --> 10:26.584
(sighs)

10:26.584 --> 10:29.295
HEY THERE.

10:29.295 --> 10:32.298

(sighs)

10:35.844 --> 10:37.178

10:37.178 --> 10:40.140
SO WHAT, YOU'RE NOT
TALKING TO ME NOW?

10:40.140 --> 10:43.601
WHAT GAVE IT AWAY,
THE NOT TALKING PART?
HEY.

10:43.601 --> 10:49.190
I CAN'T BELIEVE YOU TOLD MARC
NOT TO TALK TO ME.
YOU'RE MAD AT ME ABOUT THAT?
I SHOULD BE MAD AT YOU.

10:49.190 --> 10:51.192
YOU LIED TO ME.
WHY DIDN'T YOU TELL ME

10:51.192 --> 10:53.486
THAT SOMEBODY AT SCHOOL
WAS PICKING ON YOU?
HE TOLD YOU?!

10:53.486 --> 10:55.155
IT WAS AN ACCIDENT.

10:55.155 --> 10:57.991
BUT WHY DO I HAVE TO HEAR IT
FROM SOMEBODY ELSE?

10:57.991 --> 11:00.160
WHAT IS GOING ON WITH YOU?
(sighs)

11:00.160 --> 11:03.163
JUSTIN, DON'T WALK AWAY
FROM ME. JUSTIN!

11:03.163 --> 11:06.166
SWEETIE, LOOK, I KNOW
HOW HARD HIGH SCHOOL IS.

11:06.166 --> 11:09.169
DO YOU THINK IT WAS EASY BEING
PREGNANT AND GOING TO CLASSES?

11:09.169 --> 11:10.795
WELL, SKIPPING CLASSES.

11:10.795 --> 11:13.173
BUT EVERYBODY TELLING ME
I WAS GETTING FAT‐‐

11:13.173 --> 11:15.800
SO WHAT? DO YOU THINK
THAT HAS ANYTHING TO DO

11:15.800 --> 11:17.510
WITH WHAT I'M GOING THROUGH?

11:17.510 --> 11:21.181
I'M JUST SAYING, YOU CAN TALK
TO ME. I UNDERSTAND.

11:21.181 --> 11:23.141
(sighs)

11:23.141 --> 11:26.978
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND ME
AT ALL.

11:30.023 --> 11:31.232
(sighs)

11:31.232 --> 11:32.859
(door slams)

11:35.528 --> 11:38.114
BESIDES, YOU HATE MOSQUITOES,
WE HATE MOSQUITOES‐‐

11:38.114 --> 11:42.118
EVERYBODY WINS,
EXCEPT THE MOSQUITOES. (laughs)

11:42.118 --> 11:43.912
YES, I'LL HOLD.

11:43.912 --> 11:46.915
WOW. LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE GONNA
MAKE THAT U. N. THING HAPPEN.

11:46.915 --> 11:49.417
I'M TRYING.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

11:49.417 --> 11:51.377
YOU STILL HAVE SOME
OFFICE DECOR VIOLATIONS.

11:51.377 --> 11:54.505
I THOUGHT I'D HELP OUT. DON'T
WANT YOU TO GET WRITTEN UP.

11:54.505 --> 11:58.843
(rubber duck squeaks)
I CAN TAKE CARE OF IT.

11:58.843 --> 12:01.054
YES, HI.

12:01.054 --> 12:05.350
REALLY? OH, WELL, THAT'S,
UH, THAT'S AMAZING NEWS.

12:05.350 --> 12:10.271
UM, YES, WE WERE THINKING,
UH, SOMETIME NEXT WEEK?

12:10.271 --> 12:11.940
TOMORROW?

12:11.940 --> 12:14.108
HI, MATT.

12:14.108 --> 12:16.486
ARE YOU BUSY?

12:18.071 --> 12:21.157
LOOK, I KNOW WE'RE NOT
EXACTLY ON THE BEST TERMS‐‐

12:21.157 --> 12:23.159
GIVEN THAT YOU HATE ME
AND ALL‐‐

12:23.159 --> 12:25.161
BUT I HAVE
AN EENSY‐WEENSY LITTLE PROBLEM

12:25.161 --> 12:26.955
WITH THE U. N. SHOOT.

12:26.955 --> 12:29.916
IT HAS TO HAPPEN TOMORROW.

12:29.916 --> 12:33.378
ARE YOU SERIOUS?
YES. IT'S THE ONLY DAY
THEY CAN GIVE US

12:33.378 --> 12:35.713
ONE OF THE COUNCIL ROOMS.

12:35.713 --> 12:37.715
I'VE ALREADY CALLED ABOUT
GETTING INTERNATIONAL MODELS,

12:37.715 --> 12:39.717
AND I SPOKE TO ROBERTO DiPAOLO.

12:39.717 --> 12:42.720
HE AGREED TO DESIGN THE DRESSES,
EVEN WITH THE TIGHT TURNAROUND.
GREAT.

12:42.720 --> 12:45.598
SO HE THOUGHT HE WAS SIGNING UP
FOR SOMETHING LONG‐TERM

12:45.598 --> 12:48.893
AND ENDED UP WITH SOMETHING
SHORT‐TERM. I CAN RELATE.
NOT ONE OF YOUR BEST SLAMS,
BUT OKAY.

12:48.893 --> 12:50.895
ARE WE DONE HERE?
NO.

12:50.895 --> 12:56.943
LOOK, IF THIS IS GONNA
HAPPEN BY TOMORROW, THEN...

12:56.943 --> 12:59.487
I NEED THE HELP
OF THE ENTIRE DEPARTMENT.

12:59.487 --> 13:02.615
OH, SO... (clears throat)
YOU WANT ME‐‐

13:02.615 --> 13:05.618
OH, MATT, PLEASE DON'T
MAKE THIS ABOUT YOU AND ME.

13:05.618 --> 13:07.996
THIS IS ABOUT WHAT'S BEST
FOR THE MAGAZINE.

13:07.996 --> 13:11.457
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU'RE RIGHT.

13:11.457 --> 13:15.420
SO BETTY NEEDS YOU TO DROP
EVERYTHING YOU ARE WORKING ON

13:15.420 --> 13:18.673
TO HELP HER WITH
WHAT SHE'S WORKING ON.

13:18.673 --> 13:21.092
AS USUAL, EVERYTHING IS ABOUT
WHAT BETTY WANTS.

13:21.092 --> 13:23.094
THANK YOU FOR THAT,
MATT. (chuckles)

13:23.094 --> 13:25.847
I LIKE TO THINK OF THIS
AS A TEAM EFFORT.

13:25.847 --> 13:29.809
AND THERE'S NO "I" IN TEAM,
UNLESS YOU SPELL IT "T‐E‐I‐M."

13:29.809 --> 13:31.686
(Betty chuckles)

13:31.686 --> 13:34.689
ANYWAY, UH, YOU ALL KNOW
THE BASIC CONCEPT‐‐

13:34.689 --> 13:36.691
MALARIA, MOSQUITOES.

13:36.691 --> 13:39.652
BUT WE'RE AT A FASHION MAGAZINE,
RIGHT? SO STILL HAPPY.

13:39.652 --> 13:42.321
THERE'S A LOT OF WORK
TO BE DONE BEFORE TOMORROW,

13:42.321 --> 13:44.365
SO EXPECT TO BE HERE LATE.

13:44.365 --> 13:47.660
BUT THE GOOD NEWS IS,
COFFEE'S ON ME!

13:47.660 --> 13:49.412
(cell phone rings)

13:49.412 --> 13:50.705
(rings and beeps)

13:50.705 --> 13:52.415
BETTY SUAREZ.

13:52.415 --> 13:55.126
YEAH, IS THIS, UH,
DANIEL MEADE'S ASSISTANT?

13:55.126 --> 13:57.712
UM, NOPE. NOT ANYMORE, ACTUALLY.
NOW... WHATEVER.

13:57.712 --> 14:00.048
WHAT'S‐‐WHAT'S WRONG? IS‐‐
IS EVERYTHING OKAY? WHO IS THIS?

14:00.048 --> 14:01.674
BUILDING SECURITY.

14:01.674 --> 14:05.344
I THINK WE MAY HAVE
A SITUATION WITH MR. MEADE.

14:05.344 --> 14:07.722
(grunts)

14:07.722 --> 14:09.140
STUPID...

14:13.561 --> 14:15.646
BETTY, I KNOW. IT'S JUST...
TAHITI WAS WHERE

14:15.646 --> 14:18.357
MOLLY AND I WERE SUPPOSED TO GO
ON OUR HONEYMOON.

14:18.357 --> 14:20.234
I JUST‐‐I HAVE TO SEE

14:20.234 --> 14:22.361
THAT STUPID AD
EVERYWHERE IN THIS CITY.

14:22.361 --> 14:24.197
IT JUST‐‐THERE IT WAS,
RIGHT IN FRONT OF "MODE."

14:24.197 --> 14:26.407
I‐I JUST‐‐I LOST IT.

14:26.407 --> 14:29.786
WELL, YOU ARE SURROUNDED BY
THINGS THAT REMIND YOU OF MOLLY.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.287
NO, I KNOW, BETTY.
I‐I KNOW.

14:31.287 --> 14:33.289
GOD, HOW COULD
I HAVE BEEN SO S‐‐
(thud)

14:33.289 --> 14:35.958
(grunts)

14:35.958 --> 14:37.919
OKAY, UM...

14:37.919 --> 14:40.004
LET'S MAYBE NOT
HIT THINGS ANYMORE.

14:40.004 --> 14:43.007
LOOK, WE CAN FIND YOU
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

14:43.007 --> 14:45.093
NO. I DON'T NEED
ANOTHER PLACE TO STAY.

14:45.093 --> 14:48.012
LOOK, I'M SORRY YOU HAD TO
BRING ME HOME. I APOLOGIZE.

14:48.012 --> 14:50.264
I HADN'T SEEN MY TEMP
ALL DAY, OKAY?

14:50.264 --> 14:52.683
DANIEL,
I'M HAPPY TO HELP.

14:52.683 --> 14:55.186
IS THERE ANYTHING ELSE
I CAN DO?

14:55.186 --> 14:57.897
NO, NOTHING.
EVERYTHING'S FINE.

14:57.897 --> 15:00.775
BESIDES,
YOU NEED TO GO TO WORK.

15:00.775 --> 15:02.944
YEAH, UM...

15:02.944 --> 15:04.946
WELL... (sighs)

15:04.946 --> 15:06.948
YOU PROBABLY
SHOULDN'T BE ALONE.

15:06.948 --> 15:09.784
UM...
I COULD CALL YOUR MOM.

15:09.784 --> 15:14.831
NO. LOOK, SHE JUST WORRIES.
OKAY, GO. I'M GONNA BE FINE.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.416
DANIEL, YOU'RE CRYING.

15:17.416 --> 15:21.295
NO, IT'S THESE
STUPID ALLERGIES. I JUST...
(thud)

15:21.295 --> 15:22.880
DANIEL!

15:22.880 --> 15:24.715
SON OF A BITCH!

15:24.715 --> 15:25.758
(crash)

15:30.888 --> 15:32.390
(sighs)

15:39.480 --> 15:42.775
I HAVEN'T BEEN SLEEPING...

15:42.775 --> 15:45.278
AT ALL.

15:45.278 --> 15:47.113
JUST A LITTLE ON EDGE.

15:47.113 --> 15:50.116
YEAH, I KNOW.

15:50.116 --> 15:52.451
IT'S JUST...

15:52.451 --> 15:54.453
(sighs)

15:54.453 --> 15:58.541
I'M USED TO BEING IN THE ROOM
WITH SOMEONE.

16:01.752 --> 16:04.255
AND WITHOUT THAT...

16:04.255 --> 16:06.507
(voice breaks)
IT'S‐‐IT'S PRETTY QUIET.

16:09.343 --> 16:11.762
UM...

16:11.762 --> 16:13.848
JUST GIVE ME ONE SECOND.
(sighs)

16:16.434 --> 16:18.436
(sighs) BETTY, BETTY,
WHERE ARE YOU?

16:18.436 --> 16:20.438
I'VE GOT A ROOM
FULL OF PEOPLE HERE

16:20.438 --> 16:23.524
WAITING FOR YOU
TO GO OVER YOUR CONCEPT.
I'M GONNA BE
A LITTLE LATE.

16:23.524 --> 16:25.651
WHAT, WHAT?!
SOMETHING CAME UP
WITH DANIEL.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.321
OH, WHAT A SHOCK.
YOU'RE BAILING ON SOMETHING

16:28.321 --> 16:31.032
THAT I THOUGHT WAS IMPORTANT
TO YOU‐‐FOR DANIEL, OF COURSE.

16:31.032 --> 16:33.034
I'M NOT BAILING.
IT'S JUST...

16:33.034 --> 16:35.661
HIS WIFE DIED,
AND HE'S NOT DOING SO WELL.

16:35.661 --> 16:37.663
AND I DON'T THINK
HE SHOULD BE ALONE,

16:37.663 --> 16:39.665
SO I'M JUST GONNA WORK
FROM HERE,

16:39.665 --> 16:41.834
AND I'LL GET THERE
AS SOON AS I CAN.

16:41.834 --> 16:44.879
BETTY, THIS IS
YOUR CONCEPT MEETING.
YEAH, BETTY,
THANKS A BUNCH.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.673
WELL,
CAN YOU JUST RUN IT?

16:47.673 --> 16:50.718
I mean, you know
what the concept is.
FINE.

16:50.718 --> 16:53.679
I GUESS YOUR NEW JOB JUST CAN'T
COMPETE WITH YOUR OLD ONE.
(beep)

16:53.679 --> 16:56.641
(beep)

16:56.641 --> 17:00.645
GOOD NEWS. I CAN STAY
A LITTLE LONGER.

17:00.645 --> 17:03.898
OH, BETTY,
I CAN'T ASK YOU‐‐
YOU DON'T HAVE TO ASK.

YOU HUNG UP ON THEM,
RIGHT?
TOTALLY. (laughs)
THAT FELT SO GOOD.

17:54.115 --> 17:56.576
THANKS SO MUCH
FOR LETTING ME DO THIS.

17:56.576 --> 17:58.494
IT REALLY TAKES ME BACK.
(laughs)

17:58.494 --> 18:01.497
I CANNOT BELIEVE THAT
YOU WERE A RECEPTIONIST, TOO.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.457
BEST 20 YEARS OF MY LIFE.

18:03.457 --> 18:06.043
YOU KNOW, BEING THE FACE
OF THE COMPANY...

18:06.043 --> 18:09.589
(chuckles) DECIDING WHO
GETS TO COME IN AND WHO LE‐‐

18:09.589 --> 18:12.633
WELL, YOU KNOW.
YEAH. I PRETTY MUCH
RUN THIS PLACE.

18:12.633 --> 18:15.386
MM.
SO WHY'D YOU GIVE IT UP?

18:15.386 --> 18:17.763
OH, I DIDN'T...
EXACTLY.

18:17.763 --> 18:23.394
I GUESS ONE DAY,
PEOPLE DECIDED THAT...

18:23.394 --> 18:26.439
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU'LL FIND OUT.

18:26.439 --> 18:28.107
WAIT, NO. TELL ME.

18:28.107 --> 18:31.110
THERE JUST COMES A TIME
WHEN THEY DON'T WANT YOURS

18:31.110 --> 18:34.363
TO BE THE FIRST FACE
THAT PEOPLE SEE ANYMORE.

18:36.365 --> 18:39.160
SO WHAT DO YOU DO THEN?

18:39.160 --> 18:41.037
THIS.

18:41.037 --> 18:44.540
(chuckles) I MEAN, MY LIFE
IS STILL THE SAME, HON.

18:44.540 --> 18:47.585
I STILL DO AS LITTLE WORK
AS I HAVE TO

18:47.585 --> 18:50.921
AND GO OUT EVERY NIGHT,
MEET PEOPLE.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.506
(laughs) YEAH.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.300
I'M NOT WORRIED.

18:54.300 --> 18:56.469
OOH,
SOMEONE WILL MARRY ME...

18:56.469 --> 18:59.597
OR MAKE ME A PART
OF THEIR ENTOURAGE

18:59.597 --> 19:03.100
OR, OR, OOH! UH...
MAKE A REALITY SHOW ABOUT ME.

19:03.100 --> 19:05.102
(chuckles) IT'S ALL GOOD.
(chuckles)

19:05.102 --> 19:08.314
OOH, YOU KNOW WHAT? I GOTTA
TINKS... (whispers) SORRY.

19:14.487 --> 19:17.531
(keyboard keys clicking)

19:17.531 --> 19:19.533
I JUST TRIED
TO TALK TO JUSTIN,

19:19.533 --> 19:21.369
AND HE WASN'T SAYING MUCH.

19:21.369 --> 19:23.579
HAS HE, UH,
TALKED TO YOU YET?

19:23.579 --> 19:25.206
NO.

19:25.206 --> 19:27.583
HE SAYS
I DON'T UNDERSTAND HIM.
HMM.

19:27.583 --> 19:30.169
BUT BELLA SANTORINI
IS GONNA FIX ALL OF THAT.

19:30.169 --> 19:32.171
WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

19:32.171 --> 19:34.173
I CREATED
A FAKE ONLINE PROFILE.

19:34.173 --> 19:37.218
BELLA FRIENDED JUSTIN,
AND IF HE ACCEPTS,

19:37.218 --> 19:40.388
I HAVE MY WAY IN.
(sighs)
YOU CAN'T BE SERIOUS.

19:40.388 --> 19:43.891
WELL, WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?
HE DOESN'T WANT TO TALK TO ME,

19:43.891 --> 19:46.310
SO I THOUGHT
THIS WAS A GOOD IDEA.

19:46.310 --> 19:49.188
HILDA, THIS IS NOT
A HILARY DUFF MOVIE.

19:49.188 --> 19:51.524
WHAT? JUSTIN HAD THAT
HILARY/HAYLIE PERIOD,

19:51.524 --> 19:53.192
AND MAYBE I'D WATCH, TOO.

19:53.192 --> 19:55.194
THOSE GIRLS
ARE VERY TALENTED.

19:55.194 --> 19:57.571
WELL, I...
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

19:57.571 --> 19:59.573
WE WERE ALWAYS SO CLOSE,
YOU KNOW?

19:59.573 --> 20:01.200
AND NOW
EVERYTHING IS CHANGING,

20:01.200 --> 20:03.369
AND IT'S LIKE I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HE NEEDS

20:03.369 --> 20:05.413
OR HOW TO HELP HIM.
(sighs)

20:05.413 --> 20:08.541
THAT'S EXACTLY HOW I FELT
WHEN YOU WERE A TEENAGER.

20:08.541 --> 20:11.502
AND BELIEVE ME, YOU LET ME KNOW
PLENTY OF TIMES‐‐

20:11.502 --> 20:14.505
AND IN COLORFUL LANGUAGE‐‐
THAT I DIDN'T UNDERSTAND YOU.

20:14.505 --> 20:18.008
(chuckles)
SO WHAT DID YOU DO?
YOU DON'T REMEMBER?

20:18.008 --> 20:21.387
THERE WERE SOME YEARS
YOU BARELY TALKED TO ME, MIJA.

20:21.387 --> 20:24.056
MM.
THIS IS BEING A PARENT.

20:27.601 --> 20:31.313
I WISH I COULD TELL YOU
THERE WAS AN EASY SOLUTION.

20:37.236 --> 20:39.655
WELL, I CAN'T DO THIS.
OH, NICO, CALM DOWN.

20:39.655 --> 20:42.658
I CAN'T CALM DOWN, MOM!
I DON'T WANT TO TALK

20:42.658 --> 20:46.287
TO A DETECTIVE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENED THAT NIGHT!
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO TALK
TO THE DETECTIVE.

20:46.287 --> 20:48.789
NO, MOM.
I CAN'T GO BACK THERE.

20:48.789 --> 20:51.625
I DON'T WANT TO
REMEMBER IT.

20:51.625 --> 20:53.210
IT WAS JONATHAN.

20:53.210 --> 20:55.796
WE WERE ON HIS BOAT
AND HE‐‐HE WAS YELLING AT ME.

20:55.796 --> 20:58.048
WELL, WHY WAS HE
YELLING AT YOU?
I DON'T KNOW!

20:58.048 --> 21:01.051
WELL, THINK.
HE JUST... (stammers)
SOMETIMES THINGS SET HIM OFF.

21:01.051 --> 21:04.722
BUT THIS TIME WAS DIFFERENT.
HE GRABBED ME AND HE HIT ME.

21:04.722 --> 21:08.058
(voice breaking) HE JUST KEPT
HITTING ME. I WAS SO SCARED.
W‐‐

21:08.058 --> 21:10.770
I GRABBED SOMETHING
TO DEFEND MYSELF‐‐ANYTHING!

21:10.770 --> 21:14.607
AND I STARTED HITTING HIM BACK,
AGAIN AND AGAIN.
(thudding)

21:14.607 --> 21:18.527
I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT TO DO,
SO I...

21:18.527 --> 21:21.113
I PUSHED HIM.
OVER THE EDGE.

21:21.113 --> 21:23.866
AND HE DIDN'T COME UP.

21:23.866 --> 21:27.787
NICO, I KNOW IT'S HARD,
BUT WE WILL GET THROUGH THIS.

21:27.787 --> 21:30.790
AND YOU WILL NEVER HAVE TO
RELIVE THAT NIGHT AGAIN,

21:30.790 --> 21:33.793
BECAUSE WE WILL INVENT
A NEW ONE.

22:19.296 --> 22:22.716
♪♪♪

22:22.716 --> 22:25.845
I'M SORRY.
WE ARE WAY BEYOND "SORRY"
AT THIS POINT, BETTY.

22:25.845 --> 22:29.640
YEAH, WELL, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
ELSE TO SAY. AND I AM SORRY.
LOOK, THERE'S NO TIME.

22:29.640 --> 22:32.476
WE'VE GOT A BIG PROBLEM
WITH ROBERTO DiPAOLO.

22:32.476 --> 22:35.646
HE'S THREATENING TO WALK.
WHAT?!

22:35.646 --> 22:38.023
I DON'T HAVE A PROBLEM.
EVERYTHING IS FANTASTIC.

22:38.023 --> 22:41.527
AND‐‐AND WHAT AN HONOR TO BE
HERE AT THE UNITED NATIONS.

22:41.527 --> 22:43.612
(chuckles)
OH. GREAT.

22:43.612 --> 22:47.408
WELL, IF THERE IS ANYTHING
YOU NEED, JUST LET ME KNOW.

22:47.408 --> 22:51.704
OH, OF COURSE.
MMM, YOU ARE SUCH A DARLING!
(giggles)

22:51.704 --> 22:55.583
UH, AND I LOVE ALL
THE‐‐THE THINGS GOING ON HERE.

22:55.583 --> 22:58.502
OH, THANK YOU.
(chuckles)

22:58.502 --> 23:01.046
(chuckles)
ROBERTO IS NOT HAPPY.

23:01.046 --> 23:03.424
UM, HE SEEMED OKAY‐‐

23:03.424 --> 23:06.427
NO, NOT HAPPY! ROBERTO DOESN'T
LIKE TO BE THE BAD GUY.

23:06.427 --> 23:09.013
HE HIRED ME
TO BE UNHAPPY FOR HIM.

23:09.013 --> 23:10.848
OH.

23:10.848 --> 23:14.226
SO WHY DON'T YOU TAKE ME THROUGH
WHAT YOU WERE DOING

23:14.226 --> 23:16.353
THE NIGHT OF YOUR
BOYFRIEND'S DISAPPEARANCE?

23:23.652 --> 23:27.114
GO AHEAD, NICO.
WE HAVE NO SECRETS.

23:27.114 --> 23:31.452
WELL, UM, WE WERE BOTH
KIND OF DEPRESSED.

23:31.452 --> 23:34.413
UH, JONATHAN HAD JUST DUMPED ME.
MY MOM RECENTLY LOST A CHILD.

23:34.413 --> 23:38.167
I'M SORRY.
I DIDN'T KNOW.

23:38.167 --> 23:41.754
YES, BUT WE MOVE ON,

23:41.754 --> 23:45.257
WHICH IS WHY NICO AND I WANTED
TO SPEND SOME "US" TIME‐‐

23:45.257 --> 23:48.552
A NIGHT WHERE WE COULD JUST
FORGET ABOUT EVERYTHING ELSE.

23:48.552 --> 23:51.555
WE STARTED BY GOING TO SEE
"THE PROPOSAL."

23:51.555 --> 23:54.391
(Wilhelmina chuckles)
OH, DID WE LAUGH...
(Nico chuckles)

23:54.391 --> 23:56.393
AND CRIED.

23:56.393 --> 23:59.438
AND THEN WE WENT TO SERENDIPITY
FOR FROZEN HOT CHOCOLATES.

23:59.438 --> 24:01.440
WOMEN WILL DO ANYTHING
TO GET THEIR CHOCOLATE.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.776
(chuckles)
AND THEN WE CAME HOME

24:03.776 --> 24:06.278
AND WATCHED
A "GILMORE GIRLS" MARATHON

24:06.278 --> 24:08.280
UNTIL WE FELL ASLEEP.

24:08.280 --> 24:09.865
WE'RE JUST LIKE THAT.

24:09.865 --> 24:12.451
EXCEPT THEY TALK SO FAST.
(laughs) I SWEAR,
THEY MAKE ME DIZZY.

24:12.451 --> 24:14.453
AND I HAD JUST STOPPED
BEING SEASICK. (chuckles)

24:14.453 --> 24:17.456
SEASICK?

24:17.456 --> 24:19.291
WHY WERE YOU SEASICK?

24:21.502 --> 24:26.173
UM, I...

24:26.173 --> 24:29.760
WE TOOK A WATER TAXI
TO SEE THE CITY AT NIGHT.

24:29.760 --> 24:32.304
YES, I KNOW IT SOUNDS
LIKE A ROMANTIC THING,

24:32.304 --> 24:34.181
BUT WE DIDN'T CARE.

24:34.181 --> 24:36.016
SOMETIMES YOU JUST NEED TO

24:36.016 --> 24:38.018
DO THOSE KIND OF THINGS
FOR YOURSELF.

24:38.018 --> 24:39.269
OKAY.

24:39.269 --> 24:42.356
I THINK I HAVE
ALL THAT I NEED FOR NOW.

24:42.356 --> 24:44.400
I'LL BE IN TOUCH.

24:44.400 --> 24:46.402
THANK YOU, LADIES.

24:49.863 --> 24:52.032
YEAH, I DID
DiPAOLO'S CONTRACTS‐‐

24:52.032 --> 24:55.035
THAT WAS WHAT YOU
ASKED ME TO DO.
OKAY, GREAT. WELL, THERE'S
A PROBLEM WITH HIS RIDER.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.037
THERE'S SUPPOSED TO BE
AN ASSORTMENT

24:57.037 --> 24:59.415
OF FUN‐SIZED CHOCOLATES IN HIS
GREENROOM, BUT APPARENTLY‐‐

24:59.415 --> 25:01.417
BETTY, YOU ASKED ME
TO DO HIS PAPERWORK,

25:01.417 --> 25:04.336
NOT GO SHOPPING FOR SNACKS.
RIGHT. BUT I THOUGHT YOU WOULD
JUST, YOU KNOW, DO IT.

25:04.336 --> 25:06.296
OKAY, IT'S DARLING
THAT YOU THOUGHT THIS SHOOT

25:06.296 --> 25:08.882
WOULD SOMEHOW COME TOGETHER
WITHOUT YOU TO GUIDE IT.

25:08.882 --> 25:11.010
I'VE BEEN GUIDING IT.
OF COURSE YOU HAVE.

25:11.010 --> 25:13.470
SOME FRIENDLY ADVICE
FROM A SENIOR EDITOR‐‐

25:13.470 --> 25:16.140
NO ONE IS YOUR FRIEND. IF YOU
WANT SOMETHING DONE RIGHT,

25:16.140 --> 25:18.225
YOU DO IT YOURSELF.

25:18.225 --> 25:20.227
I COULD'VE GIVEN YOU
THIS ADVICE LAST NIGHT

25:20.227 --> 25:22.229
WHILE WE WERE WORKING LATE,
BUT...

25:22.229 --> 25:23.939
WHERE WERE YOU AGAIN?

25:23.939 --> 25:26.191
OKAY,
YOU MADE YOUR POINT.

25:26.191 --> 25:28.193
(arguing in Russian)

25:28.193 --> 25:31.864
WHAT‐‐
WHAT IS GOING ON HERE?
I WOULDN'T KNOW.
I DON'T SPEAK RUSSIAN,

25:31.864 --> 25:35.701
AND I DON'T THINK
THOSE TWO SPEAK ANY ENGLISH.
UM, LADIES, EXCUSE ME?
LADIES?

25:35.701 --> 25:39.455
SHUSH!
(arguing continues)

25:39.455 --> 25:43.208
UH, WHERE'S SUZANNE?
SHE'S IN CHARGE OF MODELS.
OVER THERE.

25:43.208 --> 25:44.710
SUZANNE!

25:44.710 --> 25:47.546
NOW I KNOW YOU ASKED HER
TO BOOK INTERNATIONAL MODELS.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.507
DID YOU ASK HER
TO BOOK INTERPRETERS, TOO?
WHAT? INTER‐‐WHAT?

25:50.507 --> 25:53.510
(arguing continues)
UM, OLGA, NO. NO HITTING!

25:53.510 --> 25:56.722
PLEASE, YOU'RE GONNA
TEAR THE DRESSES. SUZANNE!

25:56.722 --> 25:59.725
I MEAN, SHE WAS
A RECEPTIONIST JUST LIKE ME,

25:59.725 --> 26:02.102
AND NOW THE HIGHLIGHT
OF HER DAY IS GETTING GROPED

26:02.102 --> 26:05.147
BY SERGE THE DOORMAN?
THAT'S THE HIGHLIGHT
OF YOUR DAY.

26:05.147 --> 26:07.149
I KNOW.
MANDY, LOOK.
WE'VE DISCUSSED THIS.

26:07.149 --> 26:10.152
WHEN YOUR LOOKS START TO GO,
WE ARE BUYING YOU NEW ONES.

26:10.152 --> 26:12.154
I KNOW, I KNOW.
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT.

26:12.154 --> 26:14.782
I GUESS I ASSUMED
THINGS WOULD ALWAYS COME TO ME

26:14.782 --> 26:17.785
BECAUSE I'M PRETTY.
WELL, AS LONG AS PEOPLE
ONLY LOOK AT YOUR LEFT SIDE,

26:17.785 --> 26:20.245
THEY WILL.
BUT WHAT IF
THEY DON'T, MARC?

26:20.245 --> 26:22.164
WHAT IF THINGS
DON'T JUST COME TO ME?

26:22.164 --> 26:24.583
WHAT IF I
HAVE TO GO TO THINGS?

26:24.583 --> 26:27.086
I THINK I WANT
MORE THAN THIS.

26:27.086 --> 26:28.962
I CAN'T BE
A RECEPTIONIST FOREVER.

26:28.962 --> 26:33.258
OH, MY GOD.
THIS IS REALLY HUGE.

26:33.258 --> 26:35.886
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

26:35.886 --> 26:39.556
(sighs) I'M GONNA SEND
THE PHONES TO VOICE MAIL

26:39.556 --> 26:42.267
AND GO DRINK MY FACE OFF.

26:44.728 --> 26:48.107
HEY, MARC. HI. CAN I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

26:48.107 --> 26:51.110
THAT DEPENDS ON HOW MUCH
FINGER‐WAGGING AND LIP‐SMACKING

26:51.110 --> 26:53.112
THERE'S GOING TO BE.

26:53.112 --> 26:55.280
NONE, UNLESS YOU
KEEP THAT UP. STOP!

26:55.280 --> 26:57.533
(sighs)
SORRY, I'M JUST...

26:57.533 --> 26:59.535
I'M HERE TO
TALK ABOUT JUSTIN.

26:59.535 --> 27:01.995
I HAVEN'T
SAID A WORD TO HIM.

27:01.995 --> 27:03.622
I KNOW, I KNOW.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.291
I NEED YOUR HELP. (sighs)

27:06.291 --> 27:10.087
I NEED YOU TO
HELP ME FIGURE OUT

27:10.087 --> 27:13.423
HOW TO GET JUSTIN TO
START TALKING TO ME AGAIN.

27:13.423 --> 27:16.009
WELL, THAT'S YOUR
FIRST MISTAKE. (chuckles)

27:16.009 --> 27:18.262
HE ONLY CAME TO ME
BECAUSE HE WANTS

27:18.262 --> 27:22.099
TO TALK TO SOMEONE
WHO UNDERSTANDS HIM.
I UNDERSTAND HIM.
HE JUST THINKS THAT I DON'T.

27:22.099 --> 27:24.935
YOU'RE HIS MOM.
SO?

27:24.935 --> 27:27.646
THERE ARE A COUPLE OF AREAS

27:27.646 --> 27:31.149
WHERE... I HAVE AN EDGE.

27:33.151 --> 27:35.571
(sighs)
WELL, IT'S JUST...

27:35.571 --> 27:37.573
IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE YOUR SON

27:37.573 --> 27:39.575
GOING THROUGH SOMETHING
SO HARD,

27:39.575 --> 27:41.994
AND I WANT
TO DO SOMETHING.

27:41.994 --> 27:48.000
WELL, YOU CARE ABOUT
WHAT HAPPENS TO HIM.

27:48.166 --> 27:52.296
NOT EVERYBODY HAS THAT.
(sighs)

27:55.173 --> 27:58.176
WELL, DO YOU THINK MAYBE
YOU COULD TALK TO HIM?

27:58.176 --> 28:00.637
I MEAN, IF HE‐‐
IF HE COMES TO YOU AGAIN?

28:00.637 --> 28:03.682
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.
(whispers) OKAY.

28:03.682 --> 28:05.893
(normal voice) OH, UH, JUST...

28:05.893 --> 28:08.812
IF IT'S SOMETHING REALLY BIG,
MAYBE YOU COULD TELL ME?

28:08.812 --> 28:11.023
OH.

28:11.023 --> 28:13.901
WELL, I‐I‐‐
YEAH, I COULD DO THAT.

28:13.901 --> 28:16.236
OKAY.

28:18.447 --> 28:21.450
(arguing in Russian)

28:25.037 --> 28:27.873
(speaks Russian)

28:27.873 --> 28:29.875
THEY ARE FROM
DIFFERENT COUNTRIES.

28:29.875 --> 28:32.169
OLGA'S FROM GEORGIA,
AND TATIANA'S FROM RUSSIA.

28:32.169 --> 28:34.838
OH. OKAY, SO‐‐
SO THEY'RE FIGHTING

28:34.838 --> 28:36.840
BECAUSE THEIR COUNTRIES
ARE AT WAR?

28:36.840 --> 28:38.008
(speaks Russian)

28:38.008 --> 28:41.094
SHE'S SAYING,
"THAT BITCH STOLE MY BOYFRIEND."

28:41.094 --> 28:44.056
(speaks Russian)
"I WILL KILL YOU,
YOU INSECT‐RIDDEN WHORE."

28:44.056 --> 28:47.017
OKAY, I GET THE PICTURE.
THANK YOU.
BETTY,
HOW'S EVERYTHING GOING?

28:47.017 --> 28:49.019
HEY! GREAT! GOOD!
(women arguing in Russian)

28:49.019 --> 28:52.064
WHAT'S GOING ON THERE?
OH, NOTHING.
THEY'RE JUST HUNGRY.

28:52.064 --> 28:57.569
I'M SO GLAD YOU'RE HERE
AND LOOKING RESTED.
OH, THANK YOU, AGAIN,
FOR LAST NIGHT.

28:57.569 --> 29:00.572
DON'T MENTION IT. WOULD YOU
EXCUSE ME JUST ONE SECOND?
UH‐HUH.

29:00.572 --> 29:03.575
CAN YOU TELL YOUR FRIEND
I HAVE TO GO BACK

29:03.575 --> 29:05.953
TO THE NUCLEAR DISARMAMENT
TALKS?
(women continue arguing)

29:05.953 --> 29:08.830
MAYBE TURN IT A LITTLE BIT
THIS WAY SO THE STINGERS‐‐
WHERE DID THAT THING
COME FROM?

29:08.830 --> 29:11.917
THIS IS A PHOTO SHOOT
ABOUT MALARIA.
WHICH IS
CAUSED BY MOSQUITOES.

29:11.917 --> 29:14.544
SO WHY DO YOU WANT
A SMILING MOSQUITO?

29:14.544 --> 29:18.548
IS HE HAPPY BECAUSE
HE CAUSED SOME MALARIA?
THIS IS YOUR CONCEPT,
BETTY‐‐MOSQUITOES, MALARIA,

29:18.548 --> 29:21.969
BUT ALSO HAPPY. THAT'S WHAT
YOU SAID, REMEMBER?
I DIDN'T SAY
HAPPY MOSQUITOES!

29:21.969 --> 29:25.305
WHO WANTS TO SEE
AN ANGRY MOSQUITO?
WHO WANTS TO SEE
A MOSQUITO AT ALL?!

29:25.305 --> 29:27.766
YOU KNOW WHAT? YOU WEREN'T
THERE AT THE CONCEPT MEETING,

29:27.766 --> 29:29.726
SO DON'T BLAME ME

29:29.726 --> 29:32.729
IF YOU LET SOMETHING SLIP
THROUGH THE CRACKS.
MATT, YOU KNOW
I WAS HELPING DANIEL.

29:32.729 --> 29:35.816
EXACTLY. AND THAT IS WHY
YOU HAVE A SMILING MOSQUITO

29:35.816 --> 29:37.859
AT YOUR PHOTO SHOOT.
YOU HAPPY NOW?
NO, I'M NOT‐‐

29:37.859 --> 29:40.612
UNLIKE THAT MOSQUITO.
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T KNOW
WHY I'M SURPRISED.

29:40.612 --> 29:42.614
I MEAN, THIS IS
TOTALLY TYPICAL OF YOU.

29:42.614 --> 29:44.783
YOU MAKE A BIG COMMITMENT
AND THEN JUST ABANDON IT

29:44.783 --> 29:46.952
AT THE LAST MINUTE.
THAT IS SO UNFAIR.

29:46.952 --> 29:49.955
WE'RE NOT EVEN TALKING ABOUT
THE SHOOT ANYMORE.
YES, WE ARE! I AM SUPPOSED
TO BE YOUR BOSS‐‐ME.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.665
YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN HERE,

29:51.665 --> 29:53.667
NOT OUT WITH DANIEL
DOING WHATEVER.

29:53.667 --> 29:55.794
YOU'RE NOT
HIS ASSISTANT ANYMORE.

29:55.794 --> 29:58.630
AND, YOU KNOW, WHAT WERE YOU
DOING ALL NIGHT, HUH?

29:58.630 --> 30:00.841
ARE YOU TWO, UH,
SLEEPING TOGETHER NOW, TOO?
(thud)

30:00.841 --> 30:03.176
(Betty gasps)
OW! (groans)

30:15.313 --> 30:18.233
(heart beating loudly)
(camera shutters clicking)

30:18.233 --> 30:19.651
(heartbeat intensifies)

30:19.651 --> 30:24.072
(women arguing in Russian)

30:24.072 --> 30:27.534
I DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO
WITH THESE GIRLS.

30:27.534 --> 30:31.038
LADIES, PLEASE!
PLEASE! THAT IS EXPENSIVE!
(arguing intensifies)

30:31.038 --> 30:33.582
I'M SORRY, MR. DiPAOLO. PLEASE
DON'T GO. WE CAN FIX THIS.

30:33.582 --> 30:35.584
I CAN GET DIFFERENT MODELS.
(mouths words)

30:35.584 --> 30:39.713
DON'T LEAVE!
(everyone shouting
over each other)

30:39.713 --> 30:43.633
LADIES! I NEED YOU
TO STOP RIGHT NOW!

30:43.633 --> 30:46.470
IS THERE ANYBODY HERE WHO CAN
HELP ME WITH THESE MODELS?!

30:46.470 --> 30:50.682
ANYBODY?!
(banging)

30:50.682 --> 30:55.020
WHAT THE HELL
IS GOING ON HERE?!

30:55.020 --> 30:57.939
(objects clatter)
I CAN EXPLAIN.

30:57.939 --> 31:00.400
YOU KNOW WHAT? I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY I ASKED THAT QUESTION.

31:00.400 --> 31:03.570
I DON'T CARE.
YOUR SHOOT IS FALLING APART‐‐

31:03.570 --> 31:07.282
YOUR SHOOT FOR MY MAGAZINE!
IT'S MY MAGAZINE, TOO,
WILHELMINA.

31:07.282 --> 31:09.451
WELL, THEN START ACTING LIKE IT.

31:09.451 --> 31:11.870
YOU'RE PUNCHING OUT
YOUR EMPLOYEES.

31:11.870 --> 31:14.873
EVEN I KNOW NOT TO DO THAT
IN PUBLIC, DANIEL.

31:14.873 --> 31:17.918
I'M THROWING YOU BOTH OUT.
(Betty and Daniel) WHAT?!

31:17.918 --> 31:20.212
I'M TAKING OVER THE SHOOT.
YOU'RE BOTH LEAVING,

31:20.212 --> 31:23.006
AND WE'RE LOSING THAT
RIDICULOUS MOSQUITO!
THAT WAS‐‐
THAT WAS BETTY'S IDEA.

31:23.006 --> 31:25.509
YOU CAN'T THROW ME OUT,
WILHELMINA. AND I'M SURE AS HELL

31:25.509 --> 31:28.512
NOT GONNA LET YOU THROW BETTY
OUT OF HER OWN SHOOT.
DANIEL‐‐

31:28.512 --> 31:32.015
NO, LET ME FINISH. YOU HAVE TO
UNDERSTAND ONE THING‐‐

31:32.015 --> 31:34.893
YOU MESS WITH BETTY, YOU'RE
MESSING WITH ME. YOU GOT IT?

31:34.893 --> 31:37.020
THAT GOES FOR
EVERY SINGLE ONE OF YOU!

31:37.020 --> 31:39.106
DANIEL, PLEASE STOP.

31:39.106 --> 31:40.941
(sighs) WE'LL LEAVE.

31:40.941 --> 31:42.734
WHAT?!

31:42.734 --> 31:44.736
SHE'S RIGHT.
YOU JUST ASSAULTED SOMEBODY.

31:44.736 --> 31:48.406
THEY COULD ARREST YOU,
SO LET'S JUST GO.

31:56.623 --> 31:59.042
(sighs)

32:01.878 --> 32:05.048
I'M SORRY, WILHELMINA.
I AM, TOO.

32:05.048 --> 32:07.592
I HAD HOPED
THAT YOU WERE CHANGING,

32:07.592 --> 32:10.595
BUT OBVIOUSLY, I WAS WRONG.

32:13.557 --> 32:16.560
(John Henson laughs)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!

32:16.560 --> 32:20.105
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT!
(John Anderson)
I CAN'T BELIEVE IT.

32:20.105 --> 32:22.482
COUNT 'EM‐‐
FIVE MOTIVATIONS!

32:22.482 --> 32:24.484
MIND IF I JOIN YOU?

32:24.484 --> 32:27.445
OR IS "WIPEOUT" SOMETHING
YOU NEED TO DO ALONE?

32:27.445 --> 32:30.532
(John Henson) THREE, FOUR‐‐
(tv clicks off)

32:30.532 --> 32:34.786
(clears throat)

32:34.786 --> 32:37.873
HOW'S EVERYTHING AT SCHOOL?

32:37.873 --> 32:40.375
YEAH, IT'S FINE.

32:40.375 --> 32:43.003
GOOD.

32:43.003 --> 32:45.422
BUT IF IT'S EVER NOT FINE,

32:45.422 --> 32:49.301
AND YOU NEED SOMEONE
TO TALK TO‐‐NOT ME‐‐

32:49.301 --> 32:52.345
YOU KNOW, IT'S FINE.

32:52.345 --> 32:56.433
I TALKED TO MARC.

32:56.433 --> 32:59.311
YEAH. SO EVERYTHING'S...
EVERYTHING'S OKAY.

33:02.022 --> 33:04.566
(sighs) I AM SORRY

33:04.566 --> 33:07.736
THAT I STUCK MY NOSE
IN YOUR BUSINESS.

33:07.736 --> 33:10.530
IT'S JUST...

33:10.530 --> 33:12.490
I WORRY ABOUT YOU.

33:12.490 --> 33:14.993
I KNOW.

33:14.993 --> 33:16.578
BUT YOU'RE GROWING UP,

33:16.578 --> 33:19.539
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHO TO BE FRIENDS WITH,

33:19.539 --> 33:24.169
AND I CAN'T TELL YOU
WHO TO CONFIDE IN.

33:24.169 --> 33:27.505
I JUST HOPE THAT YOU KNOW

33:27.505 --> 33:30.842
THAT IF YOU EVER DO NEED
SOMEONE TO TALK TO,

33:30.842 --> 33:34.512
YOU CAN TALK TO ME.

33:34.512 --> 33:38.808
EVEN IF I DON'T...
UNDERSTAND YOU.

33:45.023 --> 33:46.524
OKAY.

33:55.408 --> 33:58.745
YOU SHOULDN'T HAVE HIT MATT
LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

33:58.745 --> 34:01.373
YEAH, WELL,
HE WAS BEING A JERK.

34:01.373 --> 34:03.375
YEAH, THAT MIGHT BE,

34:03.375 --> 34:06.044
BUT YOU STILL
SHOULDN'T HAVE PUNCHED HIM.

34:06.044 --> 34:08.255
(chuckles)
OKAY.

34:08.255 --> 34:11.258
THEN WHY ARE YOU SMILING?
FINE! I CAN'T HELP IT.

34:11.258 --> 34:14.052
HE WAS BEING A JERK.
HE DESERVED IT.

34:14.052 --> 34:16.263
BUT IT STILL WASN'T
THE RIGHT THING TO DO.

34:16.263 --> 34:19.266
(sighs) LOOK, I KNOW.
I'M SORRY.

34:19.266 --> 34:21.393
YOU'RE ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

34:21.393 --> 34:23.895
I‐I MESSED UP.

34:26.231 --> 34:30.235
DANIEL, I'VE BEEN
WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

34:31.987 --> 34:35.323
EVER SINCE YOU GOT BACK TO
NEW YORK, IT'S LIKE YOU'RE...

34:35.323 --> 34:36.449
ANGRY?

34:36.449 --> 34:38.910
YEAH.

34:41.413 --> 34:42.914
(sighs) I AM ANGRY.

34:42.914 --> 34:46.293
BETTY, I'M...
I'M SO ANGRY AT MYSELF.

34:46.293 --> 34:49.421
I'M ANGRY I COULDN'T...

34:49.421 --> 34:51.131
HELP...

34:51.131 --> 34:53.091
MOLLY.

34:53.091 --> 34:57.470
WHEN YOU TOLD ME WHAT WAS
GOING ON AT THE OFFICE,

34:57.470 --> 35:01.433
I‐I GUESS I JUST THOUGHT,
FINALLY, I COULD HELP SOMEONE.

35:01.433 --> 35:04.144
DANIEL‐‐
I KNOW
I SHOULDN'T HAVE HIT MATT,

35:04.144 --> 35:09.190
BUT I'M SO TIRED...
OF FEELING HELPLESS.

35:09.190 --> 35:12.110
I THINK YOU NEED
TO TALK TO SOMEONE.

35:12.110 --> 35:14.154
LOOK, NOT‐‐
NOT YOUR FAMILY,

35:14.154 --> 35:18.199
MAYBE NOT ME,
JUST... JUST SOMEONE.

35:25.290 --> 35:26.875
LISTEN... (clears throat)

35:26.875 --> 35:30.003
I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE
MADE A MISTAKE.
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

35:30.003 --> 35:32.631
YOU DECIDED TO HELP ME
INSTEAD OF DOING YOUR JOB.

35:32.631 --> 35:34.966
YOU'RE NOT
MY ASSISTANT ANYMORE.

35:34.966 --> 35:36.968
THINGS ARE CHANGING,
FOR BOTH OF US.

35:36.968 --> 35:38.678
WE HAVE TO ACCEPT THAT.

35:38.678 --> 35:41.514
WELL, WHAT IF I DON'T
WANT 'EM TO CHANGE?

35:41.514 --> 35:43.767
WELL, WHY DON'T YOU WANT
THEM TO CHANGE?

35:43.767 --> 35:45.101
THEY COULD GET BETTER.

35:45.101 --> 35:46.770
I GUESS. I JU‐‐

35:46.770 --> 35:50.649
I JUST DON'T WANT
TO LOSE WHO I AM.

35:50.649 --> 35:52.651
LISTEN TO ME.

35:52.651 --> 35:56.154
YOU ARE NOT THE SAME PERSON
I MET THREE YEARS AGO.

35:56.154 --> 35:58.740
BETTY,
YOU'VE ALREADY CHANGED.

35:58.740 --> 36:00.992
BUT YOU'RE STILL YOU.

36:05.372 --> 36:07.248
SO...

36:07.248 --> 36:10.794
HOW DOES THIS WORK NOW,
YOU AND ME?

36:10.794 --> 36:14.005
WE'RE NOT "BOSS"
AND "ASSISTANT" ANYMORE.

36:14.005 --> 36:16.007
NO.

36:16.007 --> 36:18.134
WE'RE FRIENDS.

36:19.886 --> 36:21.680
FRIENDS.

36:37.195 --> 36:39.364

BELIEVE IT.

YOU KNOW, BUT FOR HAIR.

36:54.212 --> 36:57.257
AW, MAN.

36:57.257 --> 37:00.552
OH, YOUR GLASSES
BROKE AGAIN?
YEAH.

37:00.552 --> 37:02.595
MM.
I'LL GET YOU SOME TAPE.

37:02.595 --> 37:06.558
OH, HEY. DO YOU WANT ME
TO CUT YOUR BANGS?

37:08.560 --> 37:11.020
UM...

37:11.020 --> 37:13.648
NO.

37:13.648 --> 37:15.817
I THINK I'M OKAY.

37:15.817 --> 37:18.653
I MIGHT TRY
SOMETHING DIFFERENT.

37:18.653 --> 37:20.989

IT'S WORTH,

39:44.591 --> 39:47.510

YOU'RE GONNA HIT ME?
