00:27.780 --> 00:30.992
-All right?
-Uh-huh.

00:31.075 --> 00:34.120
-I hope there's no
film in that thing.
-No, it's digital.

00:36.873 --> 00:39.167
Well, what do you want?

00:39.250 --> 00:43.129
I know you didn't come all the
way up here this early just
to take some snaps.

00:43.212 --> 00:44.630
Um...

00:44.714 --> 00:46.466
This friend of mine from
London phoned,

00:46.549 --> 00:48.593
he wants to bring up a
fishing party for the weekend.

00:48.676 --> 00:51.095
-12 rods.
-12?

00:51.179 --> 00:54.057
What are you gonna catch?
You know this
river's fished out.

00:54.140 --> 00:56.809
I'm sorry, Archie, you're
gonna have to tell him no.

00:56.893 --> 00:59.437
Well,
I'll be saying no to Â£20,000.

01:01.189 --> 01:04.608
I have to think of
the long term, that's my job.

01:04.691 --> 01:07.070
-Yeah, I know.
-12 is far too many.

01:07.904 --> 01:09.989
A couple maybe.

01:10.073 --> 01:12.950
It's not worth
it for the estate.

01:13.034 --> 01:15.243
How about nine?

01:15.328 --> 01:17.455
-I could live with six.
-Done.

01:19.999 --> 01:22.085
Oh, one last thing.

01:22.168 --> 01:23.336
Smile.

02:52.050 --> 02:53.259
Oh, boy.

03:05.355 --> 03:09.317
-Got your paper.
-You needn't do that.

03:09.400 --> 03:11.986
-Nae bother.
-Thank you.

03:12.070 --> 03:15.073
So, what are you up to today?

03:15.156 --> 03:17.158
Going to work.
What are you up to today?

03:17.241 --> 03:20.870
Visiting my Auntie Liz,
seeing as I'm here.

03:20.953 --> 03:23.081
Ah. Lucky Auntie Liz.

03:33.841 --> 03:37.470
-Whose cup is this?
-Herself from the office.

03:37.553 --> 03:41.724
Oh, dear, I see troubled
times ahead for Stella.

03:41.808 --> 03:44.018
Oh, shame. Here.

03:44.102 --> 03:46.688
What does mine say?

03:46.771 --> 03:48.231
Oh, Lexie.

03:48.314 --> 03:51.275
-What?
-This is much more exciting.
I see romance.

03:51.359 --> 03:54.195
Love is just about to
walk into your life.

03:57.240 --> 03:58.741
Any sign of the post?

03:59.701 --> 04:00.827
What?

04:02.704 --> 04:04.539
Your timing is
just way too good.

04:21.096 --> 04:24.349
-I've your
breakfast all ready for you.
-I haven't got time.

04:24.434 --> 04:28.021
Oh, lassie, you'll fade away.
Will you sit down and eat?

04:28.104 --> 04:30.398
-I'll take some fruit.
-Fruit?

04:30.481 --> 04:33.943
Duncan had a wee
hamster ate more than you do.
Will you sit down?

04:34.027 --> 04:35.486
You're as bad as my mum.

04:35.570 --> 04:37.989
-Well, someone's
gotta look after ye.
-I really do have to go.

04:38.072 --> 04:42.118
Tell you what then, I'll fry
up a nice bit of freshly
caught salmon for your tea.

04:42.201 --> 04:44.662
Fish fingers will be fine,
you don't have to buy salmon.

04:44.746 --> 04:46.497
Oh, you're right there.

04:46.581 --> 04:49.000
Sometimes the wee fishes just
swim up the street and
into my fridge.

04:49.083 --> 04:50.418
(CLEARS THROAT)

04:50.501 --> 04:52.795
What?

04:52.879 --> 04:56.591
Oh, well, that sounds fine.
I'll see you later.

04:56.674 --> 04:58.634
-I'll come with you.
-I know the way.

04:58.718 --> 05:01.429
Hold on,
I've a wee job for ye.

05:03.598 --> 05:08.311
ARCHIE: This is the cover for
the welcome pack. A sporting
weekend to dream of.

05:08.394 --> 05:10.897
Fishing in one of Scotland's
finest salmon rivers,

05:10.980 --> 05:13.691
under the guidance of
an experienced gillie.

05:13.775 --> 05:19.572
First class
home-cooking and accommodation
at historic Glenbogle house.

05:19.655 --> 05:21.741
Transfers to and
from the airport.

05:25.244 --> 05:26.579
Great.

05:26.662 --> 05:29.332
-But?
-No, it's... It's excellent.

05:29.415 --> 05:32.085
Good. Nice to know I'm
not entirely useless.

05:33.795 --> 05:35.254
Oh. Sorry.

05:38.091 --> 05:40.968
Duncan, you're
supposed to be working.

05:41.052 --> 05:43.721
While you're here,
can I check something?

05:43.805 --> 05:47.225
Is there much
poaching on the estate?
Salmon, I mean.

05:47.308 --> 05:50.728
I don't think so.
Golly keeps it under control.

05:50.812 --> 05:53.356
But there's over
seven miles of river.
What is he, Supergillie?

05:53.439 --> 05:58.778
No. A small place like this,
if somebody was poaching,
Golly would know all about it.

05:58.861 --> 06:01.572
-Is there a problem?
-Mmm, obviously not.

06:09.956 --> 06:14.711
Hey, it's love's young
dreamer. Have you asked
her out yet, Romeo?

06:14.794 --> 06:18.339
-No.
-(CHUCKLING)
Playing hard to get.

06:18.423 --> 06:22.093
I saw her with Archie,
in the office.

06:22.176 --> 06:26.764
Get away. In the office?
Where they work?

06:26.848 --> 06:28.474
(SIGHING)

06:28.558 --> 06:33.229
-He was all over her.
-Yeah,
'cause they get on so well.

06:33.312 --> 06:38.234
You think I'm being stupid,
but just look at the sort of
woman that Archie falls for.

06:38.317 --> 06:40.319
Justine, Katrina...

06:40.403 --> 06:44.282
So, Einstein figures that
because Stella is
brainy and skinny and...

06:44.365 --> 06:49.287
-Gorgeous,
funny, sophisticated...
-No way!

06:49.370 --> 06:51.164
Archie would
never be so stupid.

06:52.707 --> 06:54.042
Would he?

07:01.132 --> 07:03.509
Yeah, this one should do.

07:03.593 --> 07:06.762
-You think this bed's okay?
-Mmm.

07:06.846 --> 07:09.890
-Only one way to find out.
-Archie, can I have a word?

07:11.309 --> 07:12.810
In private, please.

07:17.815 --> 07:21.402
This letter
booking the weekend
that says a party of 12.

07:21.486 --> 07:24.655
Yes, I spoke to Golly,
and he said he can
only take six rods.

07:24.739 --> 07:27.367
We can't afford to turn
that sort of business away.

07:27.450 --> 07:30.036
I phoned your
friend and told him
we'll take all 12.

07:30.119 --> 07:32.372
Now, do you want to
tell Golly or shall I?

07:32.455 --> 07:35.625
If Golly says we can
only take six rods,
I respect his opinion...

07:35.708 --> 07:39.796
This is about generating
income for the estate.
That means it's my decision.

07:39.879 --> 07:42.298
-Stella, you don't understand.
-Yes, I do.

07:42.382 --> 07:45.259
Rather better than
you it would appear.
I'll deal with this.

08:01.234 --> 08:03.152
- thought there was
a shortage of fish.

08:03.236 --> 08:06.447
Uh-huh, that's why I'm
tagging them.

08:06.531 --> 08:10.201
You throw back everything that
you catch? Sounds like
a waste of time to me.

08:10.284 --> 08:14.080
Well,
it would, if you don't know
the first thing about fishing.

08:14.163 --> 08:16.374
-Is there something
you wanted?
-Yes,

08:16.457 --> 08:19.210
this fishing weekend that
Archie's set up.

08:19.293 --> 08:23.715
-There'll be 12 people coming.
-No, Archie and I talked.
We agreed on six.

08:23.798 --> 08:26.801
Well, that was
before he spoke to me.
It's gone back to 12, okay?

08:26.884 --> 08:28.594
No, it is not okay actually.

08:28.678 --> 08:30.888
This used to be one of
the best salmon rivers
in the Highlands,

08:30.972 --> 08:33.140
but it's been overfished for
years and if we're not
very careful,

08:33.224 --> 08:34.683
there'll be no fish left
soon at all.

08:34.767 --> 08:36.561
But it's still all right
for you and Hector to fish

08:36.644 --> 08:39.313
and maybe one or
two of your pals
who want to make a few bob.

08:39.397 --> 08:43.109
Excuse me? Are you
accusing me of something?

08:43.192 --> 08:46.612
No, I just heard how easy
it is to get hold of
salmon in Glenbogle.

08:46.696 --> 08:49.073
-That has got
nothing to do with me.
-Good!

08:49.157 --> 08:50.742
Well, just so there's no
confusion,

08:50.825 --> 08:52.910
from now on the only people
who fish in this river

08:52.993 --> 08:55.203
are those who pay to do
and have my permission.

08:55.288 --> 08:57.248
HECTOR: I think not.

08:57.331 --> 09:00.668
I've fished this
river for 60 years.
I don't intend to stop now.

09:00.752 --> 09:03.045
Besides,
it's none of your business.
Golly runs the sport.

09:03.129 --> 09:04.464
-Quite.
-Quite.

09:04.547 --> 09:07.550
And I run the estate.
From now on fishing is banned.

09:15.725 --> 09:17.185
(CAT MEOWING)

11:25.271 --> 11:26.773
(GRUNTING)

11:26.856 --> 11:29.984
That harpy,
that Gorgon, that Medusa!

11:30.068 --> 11:32.904
She has the nerve to tell
Hector Naismith MacDonald

11:32.987 --> 11:35.031
that he is not permitted
to fish in his own river!

11:35.114 --> 11:37.075
-Molly!
-Finished.

11:37.158 --> 11:40.661
Not if I have
anything to do with it.
I shall continue to fish!

11:40.745 --> 11:43.498
-I meant my Perry Mason.
-What?

11:43.581 --> 11:46.459
It's a wonderful whodunnit
by Erle Stanley Gardner.

11:46.542 --> 11:48.920
Never heard of him.
You sure he's an earl?

11:49.003 --> 11:51.297
Oh, not that sort of earl.
He's an American.

11:51.381 --> 11:55.551
He wrote these books about
a lawyer, Perry Mason,
and his sidekicks.

11:55.635 --> 12:00.223
Perry always manages to prove
that his clients are innocent,
despite what the police...

12:00.306 --> 12:02.850
-Monty, Rommel, let's go.
-Hector?

12:02.934 --> 12:05.311
Fine, but I thought
we had an agreement
about this weekend.

12:05.395 --> 12:06.896
And we do.

12:06.979 --> 12:09.565
-Golly...
-Not now, Duncan.

12:09.649 --> 12:13.986
Stella went behind my back.
Give me a bit of time, I might
be able to find a compromise.

12:14.070 --> 12:16.572
Ah, I suppose it's easier than
saying no to the lassie.

12:16.656 --> 12:18.491
-Golly, I've gotta tell you...
-What?

12:18.574 --> 12:19.742
It's just that...

12:22.537 --> 12:24.831
STELLA: Golly.

12:24.914 --> 12:27.625
-I'm sorry,
but the lassie insisted.
-Morning, Craig.

12:27.709 --> 12:30.378
If you're here for the fish,
your luck's out, I'm afraid.

12:30.461 --> 12:33.089
Uh, no, sir, I'm on duty.

12:33.172 --> 12:37.218
Miss Moon says
you've been stealing fish.
I'm sure there's a mistake.

12:37.301 --> 12:40.722
I saw him selling two
salmon to the driver
of the grocer's van.

12:40.805 --> 12:42.890
She means Big Alec.

12:42.974 --> 12:46.352
Do you not think it might have
been a better idea to sort
this out amongst ourselves,

12:46.436 --> 12:49.772
-rather than going
straight to the police?
-I did say that.

12:49.856 --> 12:52.608
STELLA: Where did you
get the salmon from?

12:53.693 --> 12:55.403
-That's my business.
-No.

12:55.486 --> 12:57.864
If you're stealing property
from this estate
and selling it,

12:57.947 --> 12:59.824
that's very much my business.

12:59.907 --> 13:02.201
This is crazy.
Golly has never stolen
anything from the estate.

13:02.285 --> 13:05.621
Then where did you get the
salmon from? It's a reasonable
enough question.

13:05.705 --> 13:07.749
I can't answer that
and I shouldn't have to.

13:07.832 --> 13:12.295
I took photos of Golly handing
over the fish and the van
driver paying him Â£50.

13:12.378 --> 13:14.297
-Come on.
-The money's in his pocket.

13:15.423 --> 13:16.549
Golly?

13:28.853 --> 13:32.023
-You knew about this
little arrangement, did you?
-No.

13:32.732 --> 13:34.650
Golly?

13:34.734 --> 13:36.152
I thought at least you'd be
with me.

13:36.235 --> 13:38.446
I am, but if you could
just explain.

13:38.529 --> 13:41.282
I don't want to arrest you,
but you're
giving me no choice.

13:41.366 --> 13:43.743
You do what you
have to do, Andrew.

13:44.869 --> 13:46.037
I'm sorry.

13:55.088 --> 13:59.008
I've lost my card
with the caution on it.

13:59.092 --> 14:02.553
-I'll read it to you
down at the police house.
-Okay.

14:21.072 --> 14:23.866
How am I supposed to
run a fishing weekend
without Golly?

14:23.950 --> 14:26.244
The man's a thief. Look.

14:26.327 --> 14:30.790
There you go. Golly doing
his bit to save
the estate's stock of fish,

14:30.873 --> 14:32.875
just after he told me he
always throws them back.

14:32.959 --> 14:36.087
So what do you plan to do?
Take him to court?
Sack him? What?

14:36.170 --> 14:41.050
If he's breached his
terms of employment,
yes, he's sacked.

14:41.134 --> 14:45.388
Have you any idea what kind
of trouble that would cause
here and in the village?

14:45.471 --> 14:47.306
I'll take that risk.

14:47.390 --> 14:50.184
You really don't understand
how things work around here.

14:50.268 --> 14:55.231
And you do? How long has Golly
been running this little scam
right under your nose?

14:55.314 --> 14:57.650
Come on, we've got
a weekend to organise.

15:10.413 --> 15:14.250
-Will you no go home, Golly?
-Nope.

15:14.334 --> 15:17.837
The thing is,
I have to take Eileen
over to her sister's.

15:17.920 --> 15:20.381
I'm used to my own company.

15:20.465 --> 15:22.091
But I'm no supposed
to leave you.

15:22.175 --> 15:24.761
Andrew, I'm not going
anywhere.

15:25.970 --> 15:27.597
If that's what you want.

15:31.225 --> 15:33.895
I'll put the answer phone on.

15:33.978 --> 15:35.146
Mmm.

15:41.569 --> 15:43.613
-LIZ: More marmalade?
-No, thank you.

15:45.114 --> 15:46.282
Toast?

15:47.408 --> 15:48.534
I'm fine.

15:58.044 --> 16:00.630
Have I done something wrong?

16:00.713 --> 16:02.173
It's not for me to say.

16:02.256 --> 16:04.926
If this is about Golly,
it's out of my hands.

16:05.009 --> 16:09.263
Well, you be careful, my love.
He's well liked
round these parts.

16:09.347 --> 16:12.100
-Is there no other way?
-No, there isn't.

16:12.183 --> 16:14.477
Not if he's
stolen from the estate.

16:14.560 --> 16:16.104
Oh, I'm late.

16:19.691 --> 16:21.943
-No Duncan this morning?
-No.

16:23.611 --> 16:26.322
You know, Golly's been like
a second father to the lad.

16:26.406 --> 16:28.491
Yes, I gathered that.

16:29.617 --> 16:31.327
I'll see you.

16:35.665 --> 16:37.250
Oh, no!

16:37.333 --> 16:39.544
(AIR HISSING)

17:02.984 --> 17:05.361
If it was up to me,
I'd let him go.

17:05.444 --> 17:07.238
He won't even take bail.

17:07.320 --> 17:10.491
-We're talking
two salmon here.
-I know.

17:10.575 --> 17:14.037
But someone's been leaning
on the Superintendent.

17:14.119 --> 17:17.790
If I don't play this by
the book, he'll be down on me
like a ton of bricks.

17:23.588 --> 17:25.506
(DOOR CLOSING)

17:28.843 --> 17:32.889
-How are you?
-Andrew's
looking after me fine.

17:32.972 --> 17:35.016
Lexie made this for you.

17:36.642 --> 17:39.937
-Is there a file in it?
-Hmm, hard to tell.

17:42.815 --> 17:45.526
(SIGHING) Oh, Golly,
what are we gonna do, eh?

17:45.609 --> 17:49.529
It seems to me the ball's in
your court, son. Stella is
the one pressing charges.

17:49.614 --> 17:51.991
I can talk to her, but
if you could just explain.

17:52.075 --> 17:54.035
I don't need to explain,
I've done nothing wrong.

17:54.118 --> 17:56.746
There's obviously been a
misunderstanding,

17:56.828 --> 17:58.247
but if I've got nothing
to work from, then...

17:58.331 --> 18:01.918
-Are you saying
you don't believe me?
-No.

18:02.001 --> 18:07.840
-What is this all about?
-Archie, it's about
cutting me down to size.

18:07.924 --> 18:11.469
Anyone who might know better
than her, she wants out,
one way or the other.

18:11.552 --> 18:13.721
-Oh, that's ridiculous.
-Is it?

18:13.805 --> 18:16.182
Thing that sticks in my craw
is that you're
right behind her.

18:16.265 --> 18:20.019
Hang on a minute. You accuse
me of not trusting you,
how about you trusting me?

18:20.103 --> 18:22.313
I'd love to.

18:22.397 --> 18:25.900
But I've just got this
sneaky feeling that the one
reason you're here

18:25.983 --> 18:28.945
is because you need
a gillie for the weekend.

18:31.572 --> 18:32.824
Hmm.

18:38.413 --> 18:41.541
Kilwillie and I are
going to fish in the river.

18:41.624 --> 18:47.296
We intend to
catch not one, or two,
but several shoals of salmon.

18:47.380 --> 18:51.676
Badger here will then
sell them for extortionate
sums to the highest bidder,

18:51.759 --> 18:55.430
and there is
absolutely nothing you can do
to stop us.

18:55.513 --> 18:57.306
Good morning.

19:16.325 --> 19:18.036
All right?

19:18.119 --> 19:21.205
-How's Golly?
-Not good.

19:21.289 --> 19:25.251
-He hasn't even
started your cake yet.
-What's wrong with me cake?

19:25.335 --> 19:28.421
Let me guess,
you prefer my buns.

19:28.504 --> 19:30.340
You know,
if you ever fancy a nibble...

19:30.423 --> 19:32.508
I'll head
straight for the kitchen.

19:32.592 --> 19:34.218
But in the meantime, we've
got a ton of work to do

19:34.302 --> 19:37.221
if this weekend's
ever gonna happen.

19:37.305 --> 19:41.309
So, we collect
the fishing party at noon
in the Land Rover.

19:41.392 --> 19:45.355
No Land Rover,
Golly's got the keys.

19:45.438 --> 19:49.442
Okay. And we take the party
to the river for lunch.

19:49.525 --> 19:52.403
No food. Big Alec's
blacked the estate.

19:54.155 --> 19:55.448
Right.

19:55.531 --> 19:57.867
And then we have
an afternoon's fishing...

19:57.950 --> 20:02.205
-We...
-But we have no gillie.

20:02.288 --> 20:06.709
You'll have to cancel it.
Well, teach
Cruella de Vil a lesson.

20:06.793 --> 20:08.503
It's my weekend
and my contacts

20:08.586 --> 20:11.255
and me who ends up looking
even more stupid than ever.

20:12.256 --> 20:13.633
It really matters to you.

20:14.467 --> 20:16.386
Yeah.

20:16.469 --> 20:20.640
It means we can show her that
we can do something
for ourselves. Some hope.

20:21.516 --> 20:22.725
Still time.

20:22.809 --> 20:24.644
(DOOR OPENING)

20:24.727 --> 20:27.438
Hector.
The police coming. Now!

20:39.951 --> 20:41.703
ARCHIE: Stella.

20:44.330 --> 20:47.291
-What are you doing, Father?
-Opposing
the forces of tyranny.

20:47.375 --> 20:48.501
The question is
what are you doing?

20:48.584 --> 20:50.253
Picking up the pieces,
as usual.

20:58.594 --> 20:59.804
(SIGHING)

21:04.475 --> 21:07.478
Congratulations.

21:07.562 --> 21:11.107
I've been trying to have my
father locked up for years,
and you've actually done it.

21:11.190 --> 21:13.526
-Yes.
-And now you're
calling the police again.

21:13.609 --> 21:17.196
I'm not calling anyone,
the phones have
stopped working.

21:17.280 --> 21:19.407
Why?

21:19.490 --> 21:23.244
(SIGHING) Probably the same
reason why my car had four
flat tyres this morning.

21:23.327 --> 21:26.581
Oh, great. Just when
everything was going so well.

21:26.664 --> 21:30.710
Now I can't even
call my friends
to cancel the weekend.

21:30.793 --> 21:32.795
What?

21:32.879 --> 21:35.506
There's not much point them
coming now, is there? We have
no food, no transport.

21:35.590 --> 21:37.133
Well, we can sort that out.

21:37.216 --> 21:39.093
Well, maybe we can,
but we still
don't have a gillie.

21:39.177 --> 21:41.137
-What about Duncan?
-He won't do it.

21:41.220 --> 21:43.806
-Let's ask him. Duncan!
-Yes?

21:45.224 --> 21:48.686
-I was just passing.
-Isn't that lucky?

21:48.770 --> 21:51.022
We were just
talking about you.

21:52.815 --> 21:58.905
Duncan, how would
you like to be gillie?

21:58.988 --> 22:03.201
-That's Golly's job.
-Yes, but he might not
be here this weekend.

22:03.284 --> 22:05.995
I don't know much about
the fishing side
of things anyway.

22:06.079 --> 22:09.123
Don't put yourself down.
You're always doing that.

22:09.207 --> 22:11.209
I see great
things ahead for you.

22:11.292 --> 22:14.879
You're bright and ambitious.
You'll do a great job.

22:19.425 --> 22:23.346
-I cannae.
-Oh, please, Duncan.

22:26.724 --> 22:28.309
As a favour to me.

22:31.646 --> 22:34.774
-Okay.
-Great. Thank you.

22:41.823 --> 22:44.826
Grab your waders,
I'll give you
a crash course in fishing.

22:52.375 --> 22:54.919
See, it wasn't that hard.

23:03.886 --> 23:05.430
CRAIG: Will you accept
a caution?

23:05.513 --> 23:07.432
Certainly not.
We demand to be locked up.

23:08.891 --> 23:11.310
If that's what you want.

23:11.394 --> 23:13.271
I have to ask
you some questions.

23:13.354 --> 23:16.941
Remember, Kilwillie,
name, rank, serial number,
not a word more.

23:18.317 --> 23:20.236
Can I have your name,
Lord Kilwillie?

23:21.946 --> 23:23.114
Kilwillie.

23:23.990 --> 23:25.324
I need your forenames.

23:27.493 --> 23:29.537
Angus Errol...

23:32.040 --> 23:34.334
(MUMBLES)

23:35.877 --> 23:37.295
I didn't catch that.

23:38.880 --> 23:40.715
Sharon.

23:40.798 --> 23:43.176
My father was stationed
in that particular
part of Palestine,

23:43.259 --> 23:45.011
it's a man's name there.

23:45.595 --> 23:46.929
Good Lord.

23:49.515 --> 23:50.683
Sharon.

23:53.561 --> 23:55.521
Address?

23:55.605 --> 23:58.149
Kilwillie Castle, Scotland.

23:58.232 --> 24:01.027
-And do you have the postcode?
-No.

24:01.110 --> 24:05.365
Well, you'll have to telephone
my man, he deals with
that sort of thing.

24:05.448 --> 24:07.325
And you, Mr MacDonald?

24:07.408 --> 24:10.661
Hector Naismith Macdonald,
Glenbogle House.

24:10.745 --> 24:13.831
And I will not
reveal the postcode,
even under torture.

24:13.915 --> 24:17.126
I have it here anyway.

24:17.210 --> 24:21.881
Right, well, if you'll just
empty your pockets and hand
over your belts and shoelaces.

24:21.964 --> 24:23.549
You too, Mr Macdonald.

24:24.801 --> 24:27.595
BOTH: Really.

24:27.679 --> 24:30.890
You're not going to get
yourself arrested too,
are you, Archie?

24:30.973 --> 24:32.809
No, I'm too busy for that.

24:39.399 --> 24:41.609
What are we going to
do about your father?

24:41.693 --> 24:43.444
Well, I think he can
look after himself.

24:43.528 --> 24:45.822
But he's banged up
with the hard men
and the tough nuts.

24:45.905 --> 24:47.990
The most awful
things happen in chokey.

24:48.074 --> 24:51.994
Knife fights, drug smuggling,
monkey business
in the showers.

24:52.078 --> 24:54.330
Glenbogle police station
isn't exactly Barlinnie,

24:54.414 --> 24:57.834
and it's quite useful
having him out of
the house at the moment.

24:57.917 --> 25:00.586
I have a plan.
You know Ockham's razor,

25:00.670 --> 25:03.548
the simplest solution
is usually the best one?

25:03.631 --> 25:05.675
I have come across it.

25:05.758 --> 25:09.804
I've found in this house
the opposite usually applies,
but with the sword of truth,

25:09.887 --> 25:15.309
and the trusty
shield of justice, I will
release the Glenbogle Three.

25:15.393 --> 25:18.146
It might be easier
than teaching
Duncan how to fish.

25:18.229 --> 25:19.689
(GLASS SHATTERING)

25:19.772 --> 25:23.151
Don't forget, old man,
stone walls do
not a prison make.

25:23.234 --> 25:25.278
Well, actually, old boy,
I rather think they do.

25:25.361 --> 25:26.988
(HECTOR SIGHING)

25:32.410 --> 25:35.538
-What are you doing?
-I'm trying to make
contact with Golly.

25:35.621 --> 25:39.792
He'll remember
the old Morse code.
Now, let's try, um...

25:39.876 --> 25:42.962
-Hello, Golly.
-You're looking swell, Golly!

25:43.046 --> 25:46.132
Please!
This is no laughing matter.

25:46.215 --> 25:47.759
Now, H...

25:50.345 --> 25:51.888
E.

25:51.971 --> 25:54.599
-HECTOR:
Oh, damn, there's an A.
-Hector.

25:54.682 --> 25:57.060
I can hear every
word you're saying.

25:57.143 --> 25:59.270
-Can you?
-Yes.

25:59.354 --> 26:02.690
Excellent. Just to tell you,
Golly, that we're standing
shoulder to shoulder with you

26:02.774 --> 26:04.275
-in your hour of need.
-Me, too.

26:04.359 --> 26:06.778
-Don't butt in.
-That's very good of you.

26:06.861 --> 26:11.449
Thank you very much, Golly.
Well, there we are,
communications established.

26:13.951 --> 26:18.206
Right, this afternoon,
we need to make
up 12 bedrooms,

26:18.289 --> 26:23.878
order and collect
food for two breakfasts,
two lunches and two suppers,

26:23.961 --> 26:27.632
clean the reception rooms,
and restock with drinks.

26:27.715 --> 26:31.010
-Have I missed anything?
-You might want to
get the phone fixed.

26:31.094 --> 26:35.390
Oh, yes. Someone will
have to go to the village.

26:35.473 --> 26:37.684
You won't get much help there.

26:37.767 --> 26:41.437
-But you could.
-No, it's my afternoon off.

26:43.356 --> 26:46.150
-Hold on, I need you here.
-Tough.

26:46.234 --> 26:49.737
Lexie,
I can only run this place
with a bit of give and take.

26:49.821 --> 26:52.573
Well, you should have thought
of that before you had
Golly arrested.

26:52.657 --> 26:54.075
You're on your own, hen.

26:59.622 --> 27:02.250
Now what are
the most likely lies?

27:02.333 --> 27:05.503
Uh, that
the gillie's been taken ill?

27:05.586 --> 27:09.424
No, you're the gillie.
The lies are where
you find the fish.

27:09.507 --> 27:12.719
You look at
the head of the pool,
either side of the current,

27:12.802 --> 27:15.680
upstream of any
rocks or obstacles,
and in the draw of the pool.

27:15.763 --> 27:17.932
-Okay, you got that?
-Yeah.

27:18.016 --> 27:19.225
Good.

27:19.308 --> 27:21.686
That is, no.

27:24.480 --> 27:29.318
Right, let's start
again at the very beginning.

27:29.402 --> 27:32.864
I'm supposed to be at rather
an important
meeting this afternoon.

27:32.947 --> 27:35.992
Chap from Tokyo. He's
very big in sushi franchise.

27:36.075 --> 27:39.328
He wants a round
of golf at the club.
What am I to do?

27:39.412 --> 27:43.374
Cheer up, old man.
Must be a way out
of here somehow.

27:43.458 --> 27:46.294
What, you mean escape?

27:46.377 --> 27:49.422
Yes. We could build a tunnel.

27:49.505 --> 27:54.052
You know the drill, vaulting
horse, sand down the trouser
leg, Bob's your uncle.

27:54.135 --> 27:57.555
Well, which of us would get to
do the vaulting? I'm not sure
my hip's up to it.

27:57.638 --> 28:00.350
Oh, poor old thing.

28:00.433 --> 28:04.729
We could disguise
ourselves as Gestapo officers.

28:04.812 --> 28:07.774
We might stand out
a bit in Glenbogle.

28:07.857 --> 28:09.776
True, true.

28:09.859 --> 28:12.195
We could always
build a glider.

28:13.488 --> 28:15.365
Aren't those the keys, there?

28:15.448 --> 28:18.993
Good Lord, you're
a positive Houdini, Kilwillie.

28:21.454 --> 28:23.706
-Bye, Al.
-Bye, Liz.

28:23.790 --> 28:25.583
Oh, Liz.

28:25.667 --> 28:28.711
-I want
the word on the street.
-The word on the street?

28:28.795 --> 28:33.132
-Hot fish.
Have you heard any whispers?
-Hot fish?

28:33.216 --> 28:34.550
I don't think so.

28:34.634 --> 28:36.803
Never mind, I've been doing
rather well,

28:36.886 --> 28:38.888
but I need to shoot the breeze
with the filth.

28:38.971 --> 28:40.765
-I'm sorry?
-The pigs.

28:40.848 --> 28:43.976
The Glenbogle PD...
Oh, must go.
Got a hot lead to follow.

28:44.060 --> 28:45.937
Down these mean
streets and all that.

28:57.448 --> 28:58.908
-Oh, well done.
-Landing net.

28:58.991 --> 29:01.661
Yes, yes, yes.
There, there, there.

29:02.745 --> 29:04.622
Steady, steady. Don't panic.

29:04.706 --> 29:05.915
(BOTH EXCLAIM)

29:05.998 --> 29:07.083
Damn!

29:08.334 --> 29:09.585
It got away.

29:09.669 --> 29:11.462
Which is more
than we're likely to.

29:12.755 --> 29:14.173
Ha!

29:15.842 --> 29:17.593
You dropped these.

29:17.677 --> 29:21.347
-How did you do that?
-Andrew never locks the cells.

29:21.431 --> 29:22.640
Then we're free.

29:22.724 --> 29:25.393
What happened to
standing shoulder to shoulder?

29:25.476 --> 29:29.230
-Well,
I think we've made our point.
-And I appreciate it.

29:29.313 --> 29:31.065
But there's no need
for you to stay now.

29:31.149 --> 29:34.485
-Of course we'll stay.
-This is my fight,
Hector, not yours.

29:34.569 --> 29:37.238
Nonsense!
All for one, and one for all.

29:42.827 --> 29:47.040
-What about my golf?
-Whose side are you on,
Golly's or the Boche?

29:59.635 --> 30:00.845
(GRUNTING)

30:03.556 --> 30:05.308
ARCHIE: Oh, God.

30:05.391 --> 30:08.644
-So how's our new gillie?
-Well, see for yourself.

30:10.063 --> 30:12.023
Try again, Duncan.

30:16.903 --> 30:18.946
STELLA: How long have we got?

30:19.030 --> 30:22.367
Hmm, about 18 hours.

30:22.450 --> 30:25.828
Well, we'll just have to keep
at it and hope that
nothing else goes wrong.

30:25.912 --> 30:28.373
(EXPLOSION)

30:28.456 --> 30:30.792
-What the hell was that?
-Poachers.

30:44.681 --> 30:47.392
Are you sure this
is the right place?

30:47.475 --> 30:49.310
Salmon don't
usually leap this high.

30:50.937 --> 30:53.314
ARCHIE: There they are.

30:53.398 --> 30:54.524
Oi!

30:59.737 --> 31:01.364
No, no. Leave it to me.

31:01.447 --> 31:04.492
You! Stop! Right,
you've had it now, pal.

31:07.328 --> 31:09.038
DUNCAN: Just leave it, mate!

31:12.875 --> 31:14.460
DUNCAN: I've got you, pal.

31:14.544 --> 31:15.920
Duncan!

31:42.030 --> 31:44.365
-They got away.
-No kidding.

31:54.083 --> 31:55.960
(DOOR CLOSING)

32:01.966 --> 32:05.053
STELLA:
Thank heaven we're back.
I'm dying for a cup of tea.

32:22.278 --> 32:25.031
Oh, this place is
completely impossible.

32:29.327 --> 32:32.163
Yes, it is impossible.

32:32.246 --> 32:35.667
And uncomfortable,
out of date, uneconomic.

32:38.086 --> 32:41.756
But then you fall
in love with it.

32:44.092 --> 32:46.427
I'm here to do a job,
not fall in love.

32:47.970 --> 32:50.515
Well, running
Glenbogle isn't just a job.

32:50.598 --> 32:52.308
There's something special
here, a way of life

32:52.392 --> 32:55.228
that's been developed
over the centuries.

32:55.311 --> 32:59.440
It's organic.
You have to work with
the grain, not cut across it.

32:59.524 --> 33:03.361
Which is just a fancy way of
asking me to change my mind
about Golly and Hector?

33:03.444 --> 33:05.571
Well, you won't win
in court tomorrow.

33:05.655 --> 33:08.533
Stuart Usher, the Sheriff,
he's an old
friend of the family.

33:08.616 --> 33:11.119
My father could
rape and pillage
his way across the Highlands

33:11.202 --> 33:14.288
and old Stuart
would still find
there was no case to answer.

33:14.372 --> 33:15.832
Hooray for the old school tie.

33:15.915 --> 33:18.459
And the same goes
for Golly and Kilwillie.

33:20.044 --> 33:21.879
How about it, eh?
Drop the charges.

33:21.963 --> 33:25.383
Let Golly get back to
the river before there are no
salmon left to save.

33:27.468 --> 33:31.347
No, if I do that, that's
me finished. I'm not giving
in to blackmail.

33:31.431 --> 33:34.976
Well, if you wanna look
stupid in court tomorrow,
that's fine by me, go ahead.

33:35.059 --> 33:37.478
Well, let's just talk
about tomorrow, shall we?

33:37.562 --> 33:40.106
There's no food,
probably no fish,

33:40.189 --> 33:44.027
and with Duncan as gillie,
you've got the clown prince of
the game keeping world.

33:44.110 --> 33:47.530
I'd be a damn sight
more worried about that
if I were you, pal!

34:00.376 --> 34:02.837
(KNOCKING AT DOOR)

34:02.920 --> 34:05.673
-Can I have a word?
-Yeah, sure.

34:16.476 --> 34:19.478
It's very awkward for me,
you staying here.

34:20.980 --> 34:22.565
I'm sorry.

34:22.648 --> 34:27.277
My neighbours, my friends,
they're Golly's friends, too.

34:27.362 --> 34:29.739
It's like I'm
letting them down.

34:31.239 --> 34:33.659
You see what I'm saying?

34:33.743 --> 34:37.163
-You want me to leave.
-Yes.

34:40.375 --> 34:43.378
-Right now?
-Oh, no.

34:43.460 --> 34:45.588
But tomorrow.

34:45.672 --> 34:47.547
Oh, well,
if that's what you want.

34:47.632 --> 34:52.637
I'm sorry,
Stella, I really am,
but you've given me no choice.

34:52.719 --> 34:55.806
There's nothing more
to say then, is there?
Good night.

34:57.517 --> 34:58.685
Good night.

35:09.153 --> 35:12.824
-Lex, I'm not in
the mood for all this.
-Keep your eyes closed.

35:17.245 --> 35:20.665
Okay, you can open your eyes.
Ta-da!

35:20.748 --> 35:23.418
-Where did all this come from?
-Well, here and there.

35:23.501 --> 35:26.963
-Well, how did you get it?
-I sold my body,
that sort of thing.

35:27.046 --> 35:32.301
-Why?
-Why do you think? For you.

35:32.385 --> 35:34.929
Thanks, Lex, I don't know
what I'd do without you.

35:39.142 --> 35:41.017
I won't forget this.

36:01.998 --> 36:05.251
-Who fixed the tyres?
-Duncan did it yesterday.

36:07.337 --> 36:09.339
Well, I'll be off, then.

36:09.422 --> 36:11.466
Where will you go?

36:11.549 --> 36:13.800
I'll find somewhere.

36:13.884 --> 36:16.054
This week's rent.

36:16.137 --> 36:21.059
-Och, that's far too much.
-I don't want you to lose
out because of all this.

36:21.141 --> 36:23.144
Thank you for
looking after me.

36:23.226 --> 36:25.772
-You really made
me feel at home.
-Oh.

36:30.777 --> 36:34.197
-Now, you take
care of yourself, eh?
-I will.

36:39.911 --> 36:42.288
-Have you seen Duncan?
-No, sorry.

36:42.372 --> 36:45.917
I need him to help
with my enquiries.
He could be the missing link.

36:46.000 --> 36:47.460
Well, he's definitely missing.

36:47.543 --> 36:49.712
I want the low-down, the gen,
the inside track,

36:49.796 --> 36:53.049
some info about Golly.
I'm relying on him.

36:53.716 --> 36:55.885
Mother.

36:55.968 --> 36:59.389
ARCHIE: I'll find Duncan.
We'll see you in court.

36:59.472 --> 37:02.058
BAILIFF: Case number 463.

37:02.141 --> 37:07.438
Lascelles Bank versus
MacDonald,
Kilwillie and Mackenzie.

37:07.522 --> 37:10.942
So, what's the plan of action?

37:11.025 --> 37:14.654
-There is no plan.
-Oh.

37:14.737 --> 37:17.198
'Cause I don't think I
can manage another night
in that bottom bunk.

37:17.281 --> 37:18.991
It's absolute
purgatory for the back.

37:19.075 --> 37:22.078
Don't worry, Kilwillie.
Stuart Usher will have
us released in no time.

37:22.161 --> 37:23.996
No, he won't.

37:24.080 --> 37:27.375
-Why on earth not?
-Stuart's not sitting today,
last minute change.

37:27.458 --> 37:31.963
Ah, skulduggery in
the chamber, I bet.
Well, who have we got instead?

37:32.046 --> 37:35.383
-Philip Jeffries.
-Philip... Never heard of him.

37:35.466 --> 37:37.135
Here's his entry in Who's Who.

37:39.220 --> 37:41.639
Right, let's have a look.
Where is he?

37:41.723 --> 37:44.350
Uh, ah. Grammar school boy.

37:44.434 --> 37:47.186
He's a member of
the Vegetarian Society.

37:47.270 --> 37:49.689
-Scots Nationalist!
-Oh.

37:49.772 --> 37:53.776
And a former legal
adviser to Lascelles Bank.

37:53.860 --> 37:57.113
-I smell a rat.
-Nil desperandum.

37:57.196 --> 38:00.033
Our advocate
will make mincemeat
of these trumped-up charges.

38:00.116 --> 38:03.119
-Who is our advocate?
-Me, of course.

38:05.955 --> 38:08.624
How do
the defendants plead in answer
to the charge?

38:08.708 --> 38:12.045
-Not guilty.
-Not guilty and proud of it!

38:13.463 --> 38:14.839
Not guilty!

38:17.050 --> 38:18.176
Duncan?

38:27.727 --> 38:31.189
Do you have any further
questions for this witness,
Mrs MacDonald?

38:31.272 --> 38:32.940
(CLEARING THROAT)

38:36.277 --> 38:38.988
(NERVOUSLY) What
possible good can the...

38:47.372 --> 38:50.541
prosecution of these...

38:50.625 --> 38:53.753
three men do?

38:53.836 --> 38:55.838
I'm employed by
Lascelles Bank,

38:55.922 --> 38:59.217
the current owner
of all the assets
of the Glenbogle estate.

39:07.016 --> 39:08.142
Dunc.

39:12.146 --> 39:15.900
-What are you doing?
We need you.
-Me?

39:15.983 --> 39:18.695
I thought I was the clown
prince at gamekeeper.

39:19.612 --> 39:21.906
Ah, you heard that.

39:21.989 --> 39:24.033
What Stella said,
it wasn't fair.

39:24.117 --> 39:27.537
But it was in
the heat of the moment
at the end of a very hard day.

39:27.620 --> 39:29.539
(SIGHING)

39:29.622 --> 39:32.000
But that's what
she thinks of me.

39:32.083 --> 39:35.378
And I was stupid enough
to think she might just
take me seriously.

39:37.505 --> 39:42.051
-And I let Golly
down because of it.
-No, this is all down to me.

39:42.135 --> 39:44.804
I thought you could do a job
that takes
a lifetime to learn.

39:44.887 --> 39:50.101
That's not what I'm saying.
I let Golly down.
He's locked up because of me.

39:50.184 --> 39:52.228
This is all my fault.

39:52.311 --> 39:54.480
Well, there is
a way you can help him.

39:54.564 --> 39:58.359
Do you wish to call
any more witnesses,
Mrs MacDonald?

39:58.443 --> 40:00.194
Could we have an abscess?

40:00.278 --> 40:01.946
(PEOPLE LAUGHING)

40:02.030 --> 40:05.867
-Do you mean a recess?
-Uh, yes.

40:05.950 --> 40:09.829
I was hoping that there
might be one last piece of
the defence jigsaw.

40:09.912 --> 40:12.582
-Is the witness here?
-Not entirely.

40:12.665 --> 40:16.461
I think we've
spent enough time
on this matter already.

40:16.544 --> 40:18.504
-Oh, dear.
-Mmm.

40:18.588 --> 40:22.216
If there's no further
evidence, I think we can wrap
it up without further ado.

40:22.300 --> 40:24.594
Oh, wait. He's here.

40:24.677 --> 40:27.013
Would you take the stand,
dear?

40:30.892 --> 40:34.729
-Have you got any
idea what's going on?
-Not the foggiest.

40:34.812 --> 40:38.900
"...will be the truth,
the whole truth
and nothing but the truth."

40:43.404 --> 40:45.656
There's something you
want to tell us, dear?

40:46.783 --> 40:50.328
The fish that
Golly sold to Big Alec,

40:51.913 --> 40:53.498
he got them from me.

40:53.581 --> 40:57.001
-You caught them,
did you, dear?
-Mrs MacDonald!

40:57.085 --> 41:00.296
-You must not call
the witness "Dear".
-Sorry, dear.

41:00.380 --> 41:01.923
You were saying?

41:02.006 --> 41:06.344
-My Auntie Liz,
she gave me the fish.
-Did she catch them?

41:06.427 --> 41:08.388
No.

41:08.471 --> 41:11.432
Mr Badger, that
works at Kilwillie House,

41:13.184 --> 41:15.687
he's soft on my Auntie Liz.

41:15.770 --> 41:17.271
Badger?

41:17.355 --> 41:21.150
So he gives her fish.
Ah,
I think that's rather lovely.

41:21.234 --> 41:24.278
She says, "He doesn't
say it with flowers,
he says it with fish."

41:24.362 --> 41:26.989
Why couldn't Golly
have told us this?

41:27.073 --> 41:30.410
Well,
because if Lord Kilwillie

41:30.493 --> 41:33.162
found out that Badger
was taking all those fish,

41:33.246 --> 41:34.872
he'd lose his job.

41:34.956 --> 41:39.794
-And then there's Mrs Badger.
-Does he give her fish, too?

41:40.712 --> 41:44.465
No, that's the problem.

41:44.549 --> 41:49.679
-Oh, so Golly was just
doing your aunt a favour?
-Yeah.

41:49.762 --> 41:53.349
He knew that she was strapped
for cash, so he was just
helping her out.

41:53.433 --> 41:56.602
He'd never let her...
He'd never let anybody down.

41:59.022 --> 42:03.484
-Miss McSweeney,
do you wish to cross-examine?
-No questions.

42:05.820 --> 42:08.948
Do you propose to
call any more witnesses,
Mrs MacDonald?

42:09.032 --> 42:11.993
Yes, I'd like to recall Golly.

42:12.076 --> 42:14.245
(CROWD MURMURING)

42:19.334 --> 42:21.377
You're still under oath.

42:21.461 --> 42:25.506
My husband and Kilwillie,
how would you rate
them as fishermen?

42:25.590 --> 42:27.967
How would I rate them? Er...

42:28.051 --> 42:32.472
Well, they both, over the
years... The both of them have
had a lot of practice.

42:32.555 --> 42:35.308
By which, you mean
they're pretty hopeless?

42:36.434 --> 42:38.644
No, no, er...

42:38.728 --> 42:44.817
What I would say is
that they give
the salmon a sporting chance.

42:44.901 --> 42:48.905
According to Stella Moon,
my husband and
Kilwillie went to the river

42:48.988 --> 42:54.118
and caught two
salmon in 20 minutes.
Do you find that surprising?

42:54.202 --> 42:56.371
Yes. Yes, a little. Er...

42:56.454 --> 43:00.291
As far as I know, neither...
Neither gentleman

43:00.375 --> 43:06.005
has caught a single
salmon in the last five years.

43:06.089 --> 43:08.800
Can I ask you to
look at Exhibit B?

43:11.135 --> 43:15.223
According to Stella Moon,
these are the salmon that my
husband and Kilwillie caught

43:15.306 --> 43:17.558
in the Glenbogle River.

43:17.642 --> 43:19.977
Do you have any
reason to doubt that?

43:20.061 --> 43:23.564
Er, these are farmed salmon.
You can tell by the tails.

43:23.648 --> 43:25.900
Is it possible that...

43:25.983 --> 43:31.614
Hector and Kilwillie
could have purchased the
salmon from Big Alec's shop

43:31.698 --> 43:34.659
and then pretended
that they'd caught them?

43:34.742 --> 43:38.454
I don't know
about that, but these,

43:38.538 --> 43:41.457
well, they've still
got the barcode on them.

43:41.541 --> 43:42.917
I rest my case.

43:44.210 --> 43:45.920
Thank you, Mrs MacDonald.

43:47.255 --> 43:50.216
-Miss McSweeney?
-No further questions.

43:55.138 --> 43:57.265
I dismiss all
charges in this case.

43:57.348 --> 43:58.808
(ALL CHEERING)

43:59.726 --> 44:01.978
Quiet!

44:02.061 --> 44:06.566
I should not let this moment
pass without a word to
the prime mover in this case,

44:06.649 --> 44:07.900
Miss Moon.

44:08.818 --> 44:11.154
I take grave exception

44:11.237 --> 44:14.490
to this kind of petty
and vexatious litigation.

44:14.574 --> 44:16.242
You have wasted
the court's time,

44:16.325 --> 44:19.412
and made yourself
look thoroughly foolish
in the process.

44:19.495 --> 44:23.207
I would advise you in
the strongest possible terms

44:23.291 --> 44:25.460
not to do it again.

44:25.543 --> 44:27.086
This court is adjourned.

44:35.553 --> 44:38.723
It wasn't my salmon
that was being poached,
it was yours, Kilwillie.

44:38.806 --> 44:40.099
Yes, I had rather
gathered that.

44:40.183 --> 44:42.435
Now, Kilwillie, go easy
on Badger.

44:42.518 --> 44:46.481
-I will, but I can't
vouch for Mrs Badger.
-No hard feelings, I hope.

44:46.564 --> 44:48.107
I don't know, my dear.

44:48.191 --> 44:51.444
My good name's been sullied,
dragged through the mire.

44:51.527 --> 44:53.654
But you were found not guilty.

44:53.738 --> 44:58.659
Yes, and now it's public
knowledge that I haven't
caught a salmon in years.

45:00.370 --> 45:01.704

-Oh, I should
think I'll get over it.

put the boot in?
-No, it's not my style.

45:44.080 --> 45:45.331
No, it isn't, is it?

45:46.874 --> 45:49.043
A lot of people would have.

45:51.546 --> 45:53.798
I should have
listened to you, Archie.

45:54.966 --> 45:59.137
I am so sorry.

45:59.220 --> 46:03.266
I just thought I was
doing the right thing,
but look where it got me.

46:04.600 --> 46:06.394
Humiliated and homeless.

46:09.397 --> 46:13.484
Yeah, I heard that, um,
you and Liz had
parted company.

46:16.112 --> 46:18.406

46:20.408 --> 46:22.785
Well, you're not
gonna leave us, are you?

46:22.869 --> 46:25.038
We've got
a long way to go yet.

46:25.121 --> 46:28.082
Well, I...

46:28.166 --> 46:32.628
Well,
I thought about it but, er,
I don't give up that easily.

46:32.712 --> 46:35.089
It's not my style.

46:35.173 --> 46:36.841
(STELLA CHUCKLING)

46:38.468 --> 46:40.845
I'm just moving house.

46:40.928 --> 46:42.221
Where to?

46:43.681 --> 46:45.266
Good question.

46:49.312 --> 46:53.649
We met
the barbarian at the gate
and put her to flight.

46:53.733 --> 46:58.821
-A toast to independence day.
-ALL: Independence day.

46:58.905 --> 47:03.951
And, Molly, old girl,
didn't know you had it in you.
All that legal mumbo-jumbo.

47:04.035 --> 47:06.371
Oh, that was Perry Mason.

47:06.454 --> 47:11.084
But never mind about me,
the real hero of
the day was Duncan.

47:11.167 --> 47:14.003
Oh, there you are.
We've been waiting on you.
Here.

47:14.087 --> 47:16.422
Oh, let me take a photograph
of the two of you.

47:16.506 --> 47:21.010
Lexie, I hear you've been
doing heroic work getting
things ready for our guests.

47:23.346 --> 47:25.014
-Happy?
-Yeah.

47:25.098 --> 47:29.310
-So,
how are we gonna celebrate?
-That's what we're doing.

47:29.394 --> 47:32.230
I can think of better ways.

47:32.313 --> 47:36.067
Uh, look,
Lex, this is a working day.

47:36.150 --> 47:39.862
Could you, uh, make up another
room, please? I think the one
in the blue corridor's free.

47:39.946 --> 47:44.826
This house is taking in more
paying guests than a Parisian
knocking shop on Bastille Day.

47:45.993 --> 47:47.912
This isn't a paying guest.

47:49.205 --> 47:50.998
Well, then who is it,
if it's not...

47:56.462 --> 47:57.630
Hi.

48:01.175 --> 48:02.635
(EXHALING DEEPLY)

48:29.245 --> 48:31.289
Do your predictions
usually come true?

48:32.832 --> 48:34.751
About half of them, I'd say.

48:34.834 --> 48:37.754
Trouble is, I've no
idea which half it'll be.

48:40.923 --> 48:42.675
I've got a fair idea.

48:44.385 --> 48:45.720
Coffee?

48:57.857 --> 49:02.236
That woman threw me into jail
and now you invite
her to live with us.

49:02.320 --> 49:04.072
Have you taken leave of
your senses?

49:04.155 --> 49:06.324
Stella has come here
to help save Glenbogle.

49:06.407 --> 49:08.659
We might not like her style or
her way of doing things,

49:08.743 --> 49:10.328
but she's the only chance
we've got.

49:10.411 --> 49:13.206
Either we help her
or we can say goodbye
to our home forever.

49:13.289 --> 49:16.250
-That might be
a price worth paying.
-You don't mean that.

49:16.334 --> 49:17.418
Don't I?

49:17.502 --> 49:18.920
For centuries, we MacDonalds

49:19.003 --> 49:21.506
have fought against the
invaders and put them
to flight.

49:21.589 --> 49:23.466
Not now,
though, not a bit of it.

49:23.549 --> 49:26.803
Hundreds of years
of proud tradition
thrown out of the window!

49:26.886 --> 49:29.597
There is also a Highland
tradition of treating
visitors with

49:29.681 --> 49:30.932
courtesy and good manners.

49:31.015 --> 49:33.393
I think, at the very least,
we owe that to Stella.

49:33.476 --> 49:35.103
Oh, really.

49:35.186 --> 49:36.437
Can I join you?

49:38.189 --> 49:42.276
(STAMMERING) Oh, uh,
yes, of course. We were...

49:42.360 --> 49:44.696
just going in to dinner.

49:52.120 --> 49:54.539
It's good to have
you back, Golly.

50:09.303 --> 50:12.724
She's so... So...

50:12.807 --> 50:14.851
Out your league?

50:16.102 --> 50:19.355
Join the club. Come on.

50:24.610 --> 50:27.864
Do I...
Do I know these people?

50:27.947 --> 50:30.658
-They're here for the fishing.
-Ah.

50:30.742 --> 50:33.119
I suppose you're going
to have them locked up.

50:33.202 --> 50:36.748
If the one in the red
dickie bow plays footsie
with me one more time,

50:36.831 --> 50:39.167
I'll do more than lock him up.

50:39.250 --> 50:45.131
Ah. I, um,
recommend the claymore
hanging in the hall.

50:45.214 --> 50:47.633
Uh, that's if he
survives the food, of course.

50:47.717 --> 50:49.177
Ah, Lexie.

50:51.220 --> 50:53.931
-Can I serve you, madam?
-Yes, please. What is it?

50:54.015 --> 50:55.433
It's your favourite.

50:57.018 --> 50:58.019
Poached salmon.
