00:05.187 --> 00:08.269
Previously on Mystery Incorporated...

00:08.389 --> 00:11.181
Like since when don't you
wanna be late for school?

00:11.301 --> 00:14.199
Since I found out who our
new Biology teacher is.

00:14.319 --> 00:16.892
Doctor Rick Spartan.
I'm your biggest fan.

00:17.012 --> 00:18.738
Mrs. jackson, tell us what happened.

00:18.858 --> 00:20.501
Took me a nap this afternoon,

00:20.621 --> 00:22.971
when I woke up I was on the TV,

00:23.091 --> 00:24.929
and everyone knew my recipe.

00:25.049 --> 00:27.035
Jinkies, look at this, gang.

00:27.155 --> 00:29.284
Senor P. Llave.

00:29.404 --> 00:30.904
Like what kind of name is that?

00:31.024 --> 00:34.188
Primero means first in Spanish
and llave is key.

00:34.308 --> 00:36.619
But what does an old gun got to do
with a key?

00:36.739 --> 00:39.019
***, the helmet you got on.

00:39.139 --> 00:40.085
Where did you get it?

00:40.205 --> 00:41.633
This is the second key.

00:41.753 --> 00:43.635
But what does all mean?

00:43.755 --> 00:46.510
Nibiru is coming!

00:51.231 --> 00:52.431
Well, howdy, y'all.

00:52.499 --> 00:54.066
It is such a pleasure
cooking in front

00:54.134 --> 00:57.272
of a live studio audience
here in beautiful Crystal Cove.

00:57.340 --> 00:59.842
Today we'll be cooking
up a batch of goodness

00:59.909 --> 01:03.247
I call FranciLee Jackson's
double-dip bacon

01:03.314 --> 01:05.217
and butter-breaded
croissant snack.

01:05.284 --> 01:06.551
Mmm mmm.

01:06.619 --> 01:08.019
Now, a lot of you folks
at home been asking

01:08.087 --> 01:10.421
if I worry about my recipes
aren't the healthiest.

01:10.489 --> 01:13.724
All I got to say is,
I ain't no doctor, y'all.

01:13.792 --> 01:14.991
While that's simmering,

01:15.059 --> 01:16.759
we'll start prepping
my dessert.

01:16.827 --> 01:18.828
I call it FranciLee Jackson's

01:18.896 --> 01:20.429
bacon bread pie...
Oh! Oh! Oh!

01:20.497 --> 01:22.499
Now, don't worry, y'all.

01:22.567 --> 01:25.169
If this happens at home, just
throw in another bacon butter.

01:32.979 --> 01:34.580
No. No!

01:34.648 --> 01:36.949
Get back!

01:37.017 --> 01:39.085
Aah!

01:47.363 --> 01:49.697
Danger, Cachinga.
Ready your spear.

01:49.765 --> 01:52.166
This is a job for Rick Spartan,

01:52.234 --> 01:54.502
academic of adventure.

01:54.570 --> 01:57.272
Oh, joy.
A road trip.

Scooby-Dooby-Doo!

Access denied.

02:45.253 --> 02:47.421
Ricky!

02:47.489 --> 02:49.023
Ricky, what have you done?

02:49.090 --> 02:51.525
I've been locked out
of the system.

02:51.593 --> 02:53.795
I know.
I did it on purpose.

02:53.862 --> 02:56.330
You're out of control,
Professor Pericles,

02:56.398 --> 02:58.132
and I'm putting a stop to it.

02:58.200 --> 02:59.433
I'm in charge.

02:59.501 --> 03:02.404
I build Destroido
from the ground up,

03:02.471 --> 03:05.640
while you were cooling
your beak in prison.

03:05.708 --> 03:08.243
It's time that I...uhh!

03:08.311 --> 03:12.882
You are in charge
of nothing, Ricky Owens.

03:12.949 --> 03:14.550
You have never been anything

03:14.618 --> 03:17.353
other than an idiotic
human mascot,

03:17.421 --> 03:21.191
a shoulder for me
to perch upon.

03:21.258 --> 03:23.326
Come on, Scooby, old buddy.

03:23.394 --> 03:24.728
I'm worried about you.

03:24.795 --> 03:27.464
He only had 3 breakfasts
and 2 lunches.

03:27.532 --> 03:28.965
You gotta eat, pal.

03:29.033 --> 03:30.500
I don't feel good, Raggy.

03:30.568 --> 03:32.368
I'm scared.

03:32.436 --> 03:33.603
Nova sat up.

03:33.671 --> 03:35.438
She sat up in her hospital
bed and spoke.

03:35.506 --> 03:38.742
She said "Nibiru,
Nibiru is coming."

03:38.809 --> 03:42.312
It's too much!
It's too much!

03:42.380 --> 03:44.081
It is definitely something.

03:44.148 --> 03:47.384
Nova doesn't speak, ever.

03:47.452 --> 03:49.453
And the more I research
this Nibiru,

03:49.521 --> 03:51.222
the less I think I know.

03:51.289 --> 03:53.824
I borrowed this book from my
mother, hoping it would help.

03:53.892 --> 03:58.696
"Supernatural curses and the
extradimensional forces behind them."

03:58.764 --> 04:00.398
You think maybe Nova's cursed?

04:00.466 --> 04:02.133
This whole town is cursed.

04:02.201 --> 04:03.602
We got used to crazy criminals

04:03.670 --> 04:05.237
pretending to be monsters
all the time.

04:05.305 --> 04:06.906
But things are different.

04:06.974 --> 04:08.408
This is can't explain.

04:08.476 --> 04:10.410
It must have something
to do with the treasure

04:10.478 --> 04:12.078
buried under Crystal Cove.

04:12.146 --> 04:13.780
The one the planospheric disc
should lead us to,

04:13.848 --> 04:17.017
but instead, it keeps leading us
to strange old objects,

04:17.084 --> 04:19.619
like the flintlock
and the Conquistador's helmet.

04:19.687 --> 04:21.221
The first and second key,

04:21.289 --> 04:23.423
to what and why, I don't know.

04:23.491 --> 04:27.094
Gang, for the first time in our
history as mystery-solvers,

04:27.162 --> 04:30.331
we have to consider that
something truly supernatural

04:30.399 --> 04:31.599
is happening here.

04:33.702 --> 04:35.269
Well, you know what I say?

04:35.337 --> 04:37.871
When things get scary,
the scared get pizza.

04:37.939 --> 04:39.873
And when things get
extra scary,

04:39.941 --> 04:41.641
we get extra-deep dish.

04:41.709 --> 04:42.976
Right, Scooby-Doo?

04:43.044 --> 04:46.546
Scooby-Dooby delicious!

04:47.848 --> 04:50.450
You know, Fred, with
everything that's happening,

04:50.518 --> 04:53.386
it makes you realize
how precious life is.

04:53.454 --> 04:55.288
It kind of makes you
not want to waste time

04:55.356 --> 04:57.958
and just tell certain
people how you really feel.

04:58.026 --> 04:59.459
Doesn't it?

04:59.527 --> 05:00.760
I think I'm ready now.

05:00.828 --> 05:03.296
I'd be open to hearing
how you feel.

05:03.364 --> 05:06.733
You mean, like, emotions or
something crazy like that?

05:06.801 --> 05:10.904
Uh...well, right now
I guess I feel kind of...

05:10.972 --> 05:12.072
Yes?

05:12.140 --> 05:14.274
Hungry! I feel hungry!

05:16.711 --> 05:22.082
Hunger is not an emotion,
Fred Jones!

05:22.150 --> 05:23.483
Here you go.

05:23.551 --> 05:25.218
Two of our 9-layer
double deep dish pizzas

05:25.286 --> 05:26.886
with everything twice.

05:26.954 --> 05:29.489
Right here, please.

05:29.557 --> 05:31.424
Mmm!

05:41.569 --> 05:42.969
No way!

05:43.037 --> 05:44.304
It's Dr. Rick Spartan.

05:44.371 --> 05:46.439
He's an academic of adventure.

05:46.507 --> 05:48.608
Cachinga! We've got
to get rid of the food!

05:48.676 --> 05:50.777
We've got to get rid
of all of the food!

05:53.581 --> 05:54.514
Ohh!

05:54.582 --> 05:56.116
What is he doing?

05:56.184 --> 05:57.918
Why is he throwing
all the food out the window?

05:57.986 --> 06:00.420
Who cares? Whatever
Dr. Spartan is doing,

06:00.488 --> 06:02.456
he probably has
a great reason for doing it.

06:02.523 --> 06:03.924
I'm gonna get in on this.

06:03.992 --> 06:05.192
Hi, Cachinga!

06:05.260 --> 06:06.760
Charmed, Frederick Jones.
Charmed.

06:06.828 --> 06:09.029
Hey, Dr. Spartan,
let me help.

06:09.097 --> 06:10.897
Fred Jones, you're a brick.

06:15.904 --> 06:17.738
What is with that guy?
Doesn't he know

06:17.806 --> 06:20.540
there are hungry mouths in
the world that need feeding?

06:20.608 --> 06:23.210
Yeah! And yours
and mine.

06:23.277 --> 06:26.413
Sir, if I may be so bold,
the demon isn't here.

06:26.481 --> 06:30.550
No time for talky-talky. Big-time
creepy creep on the way.

06:30.618 --> 06:32.052
Huh?

06:51.706 --> 06:52.906
Curses! Too late.

06:52.974 --> 06:54.808
We have to stop it.

06:56.744 --> 06:58.011
- Ooh!
- Uhh!

06:58.079 --> 06:59.180
Jinkies!

07:08.356 --> 07:10.323
Yow!

07:22.370 --> 07:24.037
All the food is gone.

07:24.105 --> 07:26.140
It ate, like, everything.

07:26.207 --> 07:27.441
What was that thing?

07:27.509 --> 07:29.376
That is the gluten demon.

07:29.444 --> 07:32.547
If we don't stop it, it'll
devour the entire food supply

07:32.614 --> 07:34.983
and starve us all,
until there's nothing,

07:35.051 --> 07:38.019
and no one left alive
in Crystal Cove.

07:47.509 --> 07:49.043
The gluten demon
is a terrible beast.

07:49.111 --> 07:51.379
It consumes vast amounts
of gluten.

07:51.447 --> 07:54.415
Starchy foods...breads,
pastas, that sort of thing.

07:54.483 --> 07:57.084
Cachinga and I have had
a gluten-free diet for years.

07:57.152 --> 08:00.555
It's what makes my muscles
so chiseled, like a Greek God.

08:00.623 --> 08:02.690
Yeah. And I don't
touch the stuff either.

08:02.758 --> 08:04.425
Well, sure you do, Fred.

08:04.492 --> 08:06.193
You eat everything we eat.

08:06.260 --> 08:09.261
I mean as of right now
I don't touch the stuff either.

08:09.329 --> 08:12.365
Dr. Spartan, is there anything else
you can tell us about this demon?

08:12.433 --> 08:14.033
Cachinga,
make book plenty open.

08:14.101 --> 08:15.801
Hold-hold. K-k?

08:15.869 --> 08:17.970
Oh, the scrapbook.
How thrilling.

08:18.038 --> 08:19.605
At various times in history,

08:19.673 --> 08:22.542
the beast has shown
its heinous face.

08:22.610 --> 08:24.377
The gluten demon was a scourge

08:24.445 --> 08:27.213
from ancient Egypt
through the fall of Rome,

08:27.281 --> 08:28.915
destroying their
wheat harvests.

08:28.982 --> 08:30.716
It even made an appearance
in France,

08:30.784 --> 08:33.152
tainting the bread supply
in the 1780s

08:33.220 --> 08:35.554
that ultimately led
to the French revolution.

08:35.623 --> 08:39.293
There are other demons that have
strange affiliations with food,

08:39.361 --> 08:40.628
like the asparagus demon,

08:40.695 --> 08:43.431
the dairy demon.
I vanquished many of them.

08:43.498 --> 08:46.133
Except that olive oil demon.
Slippery devil.

08:46.201 --> 08:47.601
Ha ha ha ha!

08:47.669 --> 08:50.470
But as you can see,
I don't have any pictures.

08:50.538 --> 08:52.973
My faithful guide
and manservant Cachinga here

08:53.040 --> 08:54.174
dropped the camera.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.575
He can't seem to hold a spear

08:55.643 --> 08:57.977
and use modern technology
at the same time.

08:58.045 --> 08:59.779
It's because
you were shouting at me

08:59.846 --> 09:01.581
to take the picture
and I got nervous.

09:01.648 --> 09:03.583
I thought you savages were
supposed to have an iron will.

09:03.650 --> 09:06.218
Well, forgive me for
being such a disappointment.

09:06.286 --> 09:08.487
Why didn't you let Marion
take the pictures?

09:08.555 --> 09:10.055
Where is your wife, anyway?

09:10.123 --> 09:12.492
Marion? Marion's gone.

09:12.560 --> 09:15.195
We had a farm in Africa,

09:15.263 --> 09:16.697
there on the Serengeti.

09:16.764 --> 09:17.764
It was unbelievable.

09:17.832 --> 09:19.433
We saw things.

09:19.501 --> 09:22.369
They have tsetse flies down
there the size of eagles.

09:22.437 --> 09:24.337
We would stand in front of
our hut and watch in horror

09:24.405 --> 09:27.007
as these giant flies would pick
cows and zebras off the ground

09:27.075 --> 09:30.344
and carry them away. And then
one day they attacked us.

09:30.411 --> 09:32.346
The giant flies
came at us from all sides.

09:32.414 --> 09:34.681
I took down as many as I
could, but it was no use.

09:34.749 --> 09:36.517
In the end they got Marion!

09:36.584 --> 09:39.553
They flew away with her to their
mountain lair on Kilimanjaro.

09:39.621 --> 09:42.189
She's trapped up there still!

09:42.257 --> 09:43.324
It's horrible.

09:43.392 --> 09:44.558
Horrible!

09:47.028 --> 09:48.996
Actually, she's fine.

09:49.064 --> 09:50.931
She's just staying
with her mother in Irvine.

09:50.999 --> 09:52.332
They're not getting along.

09:52.400 --> 09:55.235
Cachinga, no more
floppy-flop lip-lips.

09:58.540 --> 09:59.974
Master needs silence.

10:00.041 --> 10:01.842
Head place have bad juju. K-k?

10:03.445 --> 10:04.812
It's my mom.

10:04.880 --> 10:06.147
Mom, what's up?

10:07.650 --> 10:09.418
Mom? Mom!

10:16.927 --> 10:19.062
Mom, mom, are you here?

10:19.129 --> 10:21.764
Huh?

10:21.832 --> 10:24.566
I'm so....

10:29.105 --> 10:32.441
Hyah! Hyah!

10:36.746 --> 10:38.914
Deputy?
What are you doing here?

10:38.981 --> 10:42.083
Sheriff Stone told me to stay
here and secure the crime scene.

10:42.151 --> 10:44.753
Apparently some kind of monster
wrecked the place

10:44.821 --> 10:47.122
and ate all the biscotti
cakes and cookies.

10:47.190 --> 10:49.891
- And my mom?
- She's fine. They took her home.

10:49.959 --> 10:53.228
Sheriff had to go down to the
rebuilt bloody steak restaurant.

10:53.296 --> 10:56.465
That crazy monster attacked there, too.
Ate everything.

10:56.532 --> 11:00.401
The beast is feeding. We have to act
fast before it gets too powerful.

11:00.469 --> 11:04.139
Um, if you don't need me,
I'll just go back to hiding.

11:05.842 --> 11:08.644
I have a special potion that'll
stop the gluten demon cold.

11:08.711 --> 11:10.779
Learned it from a shaman
up the Yupiyali River.

11:10.847 --> 11:12.748
It's a tributary of the Amazon.

11:12.816 --> 11:16.051
I think we all know where the
Yupiyali River is, Dr. Spartan.

11:16.119 --> 11:17.319
Like, I didn't.

11:17.387 --> 11:19.055
I can't even say it.

11:19.122 --> 11:22.491
Yukaka. Yukaladaa.
Yukalalalala.

11:22.559 --> 11:23.726
Cucamonga.

11:26.529 --> 11:27.796
What a...

11:27.864 --> 11:30.333
Here's the recipe.
Cachinga will take you

11:30.400 --> 11:32.335
to the strange
and obscure locations

11:32.402 --> 11:34.136
to retrieve all
the necessary ingredients.

11:34.204 --> 11:37.607
This is great! We can go
with a 3-pronged attack.

11:37.674 --> 11:39.308
Cachinga and the girls
get the potion.

11:39.376 --> 11:40.576
Shaggy and Scooby will eat

11:40.644 --> 11:41.965
all the gluten-filled
food in town

11:42.012 --> 11:43.346
to starve the gluten demon.

11:43.413 --> 11:47.817
And Dr. Spartan and I
will rig a special trap.

11:47.884 --> 11:49.084
Count us in.

11:49.152 --> 11:50.319
Yeah!

11:50.387 --> 11:53.355
Again me and Scooby
eat everything.

11:53.423 --> 11:55.424
Poor old Spartan.

11:55.492 --> 11:57.927
He's just so lost
without Marion.

11:57.994 --> 12:00.830
Without her, his plans
have become quite ludicrous.

12:00.897 --> 12:03.232
The potion itself
is probably useless,

12:03.300 --> 12:06.269
but I'd love to investigate
the mystery with you girls.

12:06.337 --> 12:10.440
Mr. Cachinga, now you're
talking our language.

12:10.507 --> 12:13.543
Let's investigate.

12:56.088 --> 12:57.222
- Mmm!
- Mmm!

13:16.209 --> 13:20.145
Brad, Judy, I need to know
I can count on you.

13:20.212 --> 13:23.949
Pericles has gone insane.
He's dangerous.

13:24.017 --> 13:26.952
The three of us can still
get the treasure,

13:27.020 --> 13:29.255
but Pericles has to go.

13:29.322 --> 13:31.957
- We're with you, Ricky.
- You can count on us.

13:32.025 --> 13:34.793
Good. Don't say a word
to anyone.

13:42.902 --> 13:46.605
Jinkies. What's this?

13:46.673 --> 13:49.208
They look like receipts
from a warehouse.

13:49.276 --> 13:52.111
And they're all signed AJS.

13:55.616 --> 13:57.783
Are you the insurance
adjusters?

13:57.850 --> 13:59.051
Did you bring me my check?

13:59.118 --> 14:00.285
Huh?

14:00.353 --> 14:01.787
You own these studios,

14:01.855 --> 14:04.056
Mr. Albrect J. Schwartz?

14:04.124 --> 14:06.058
Of course, I own the place.

14:06.126 --> 14:07.626
Now give me my million dollars
from insurance. Come on.

14:07.694 --> 14:09.428
We are not from
the insurance company.

14:09.496 --> 14:11.063
And we were just leaving.

14:12.499 --> 14:15.735
Guys, I think we'd better
go check out that warehouse.

14:15.802 --> 14:18.337
I have a feeling
that's where our next clue is.

14:32.020 --> 14:34.689
Is it me, or is it strange

14:34.757 --> 14:37.425
that an abandoned warehouse
in a forgotten part of town

14:37.493 --> 14:41.163
has been filled
with baking ingredients?

14:41.230 --> 14:45.033
And the shipping manifest
and order forms for all this

14:45.100 --> 14:47.835
are signed by none other
than AJS.

14:47.903 --> 14:49.036
That Schwartz fellow.

15:23.869 --> 15:26.438
Cachinga, what was in that?

15:26.505 --> 15:27.605
Just my lunch.

15:27.673 --> 15:29.007
I'm a gluten-free vegan.

15:29.074 --> 15:31.276
A nice quinoa salad
with cucumbers,

15:31.343 --> 15:32.877
a pinch of dill,
sprinkle of garlic.

15:32.945 --> 15:35.013
Velma, you think
Cachinga's gluten-free food

15:35.081 --> 15:36.448
really drove the demon off?

15:36.515 --> 15:39.551
I'm not so sure what's
really going on here.

15:39.619 --> 15:41.019
But something's bugging me.

15:41.087 --> 15:43.021
Come on. We have
a few things to check

15:43.089 --> 15:44.856
before we can put
this mystery to bed.

15:44.924 --> 15:47.259
Like hospital birth records,
food allergies,

15:47.327 --> 15:50.696
and that video footage from
FranciLee's live broadcast.

15:56.669 --> 15:58.770
Now, if that gluten demon
wants any bread,

15:58.838 --> 16:01.773
he'll have to come to this
bakery, right, Dr. Spartan?

16:01.841 --> 16:04.877
Marion should be here. If only
she wasn't in the clutches

16:04.944 --> 16:06.678
of that evil Irvine cave troll.

16:06.746 --> 16:09.347
I thought you said tsetse
flies as big as eagles took her.

16:09.415 --> 16:12.417
What? I, uh...
Never mind all that.

16:12.485 --> 16:14.219
Let's double-check
the trap and...

16:14.287 --> 16:15.954
We're back.
And have we been busy.

16:16.021 --> 16:18.723
Daphne, it feels like hours
since I've seen you.

16:18.790 --> 16:20.992
That's because
it has been hours, Fred.

16:21.060 --> 16:22.627
Well, that would explain it.

16:22.694 --> 16:25.496
Listen, we found out so about
about the gluten demon...

16:34.073 --> 16:36.407
Like, I'm too full
to be scared.

16:36.475 --> 16:38.976
Yeah. Me, too.

16:40.746 --> 16:43.147
- Now, Dr. Spartan!
- Huhh!

16:50.455 --> 16:52.089
That thing's gotten too big.

16:52.157 --> 16:53.190
The net won't hold!

17:06.938 --> 17:10.107
Fred!

17:10.175 --> 17:12.542
Oh!

17:12.609 --> 17:17.113
Like, that gluten demon
just crunched on our friends.

17:17.181 --> 17:20.349
Ooh, that makes me mad.
Come on.

17:32.729 --> 17:34.397
Let's rumble.

17:34.464 --> 17:40.303
Like pick on someone
your own super-size size.

17:52.482 --> 17:54.316
Aah...

17:54.384 --> 17:55.717
Oof!

18:04.993 --> 18:07.494
Uhh!

18:32.421 --> 18:35.590
Yaah!

18:41.430 --> 18:45.966
Now let's see who
the gluten demon really is.

18:46.034 --> 18:48.202
FranciLee Jackson!

18:48.269 --> 18:52.140
Not a big surprise after the work
that Cachinga, Daphne, and I did.

18:52.207 --> 18:55.677
FranciLee's cooking show wasn't
taped before a live audience.

18:55.744 --> 18:57.378
She made the tape herself,

18:57.446 --> 18:59.714
allowing her to work
the special effects

18:59.782 --> 19:01.783
and adding in the gluten
demon during editing.

19:01.851 --> 19:04.452
Plus, her stage name
is FranciLee Jackson,

19:04.520 --> 19:06.454
but her birth certificate
lists her as

19:06.522 --> 19:08.457
Agatha Juniper Schildenheimer.

19:08.524 --> 19:10.459
As AJS, she signed
those manifests.

19:10.526 --> 19:14.063
She rented
that secret warehouse.

19:14.130 --> 19:17.133
And she has a strange food
allergy to all things healthy.

19:17.200 --> 19:20.503
Which is why she reacted to
Cachinga's salad lunch so insanely.

19:20.570 --> 19:22.572
The only thing
we don't know is why.

19:22.640 --> 19:24.374
Oh, y'all, it's so simple.

19:24.442 --> 19:26.410
I needed a big comeback.

19:26.477 --> 19:29.480
After my cornbread recipe was
revealed to have no corn in it,

19:29.547 --> 19:31.882
I was ruined. Ruined!

19:31.950 --> 19:34.685
My only chance was to open
my own bakery

19:34.753 --> 19:37.521
where I could serve up
my new breakout dish,

19:37.589 --> 19:40.824
the double bacon mayonnaise
butter-stuffed pasta surprise

19:40.892 --> 19:42.893
with buttered bread sauce!

19:42.961 --> 19:44.695
Any cook worth
their kosher sea salt

19:44.762 --> 19:46.396
knows the legend
of the gluten demon.

19:46.464 --> 19:48.598
I dressed up like that
and started destroying

19:48.666 --> 19:52.702
every restaurant in town so there'd
be no competition when I opened mine.

19:52.770 --> 19:55.905
And I would have done it, too,
been a huge success again,

19:55.973 --> 19:59.109
if it weren't for all y'all
bread-hatin' health fanatics!

19:59.177 --> 20:01.879
That's it, boys.
Let's roll her away.

20:06.485 --> 20:08.386
My bowl! My precious bowl!

20:08.454 --> 20:11.556
No! My bowl! It's mine!

20:11.624 --> 20:12.657
Mine!

20:12.725 --> 20:15.894
It's ancient by the look of it.

20:15.962 --> 20:17.296
"Tercero llave."

20:17.363 --> 20:19.264
It's the third key!

20:19.332 --> 20:21.399
Dr. Spartan. Rick.

20:21.467 --> 20:23.068
Call Marion.
Call your wife

20:23.135 --> 20:24.770
and tell her you love her.

20:24.837 --> 20:26.371
And if she feels the same way,

20:26.439 --> 20:29.474
do everything you gotta do
to keep her.

20:31.511 --> 20:34.112
Fred Jones, are you feeling ok?

20:34.180 --> 20:35.747
Not yet.

20:35.815 --> 20:39.318
There. I feel better now.

20:39.385 --> 20:42.488
Cachinga! Make ready
minivan plenty fast.

20:42.555 --> 20:45.658
We go quickie-quick.
Marion's agreed to come home.

20:45.725 --> 20:48.094
Now all we have to do
is rescue her from her mother.

20:48.162 --> 20:50.730
Good to see you
in such fine spirits, sir.

20:50.798 --> 20:55.569
Push!

20:55.637 --> 20:58.839
Uh, sorry, guys.
Looks like you'll have to walk.

20:58.907 --> 21:00.408
Ok with us.

21:00.476 --> 21:02.577
It'll give us a chance
to burn off all this food.

21:02.645 --> 21:04.045
Hoo-hoo!

21:07.449 --> 21:12.086
So you see, Professor
Pericles, it's over.

21:12.154 --> 21:14.021
You're not the boss here.

21:14.089 --> 21:15.122
I am.

21:15.190 --> 21:17.658
And you're out of the group.

21:20.429 --> 21:23.698
Oh, Ricky, Ricky,

21:23.766 --> 21:27.301
my loyal Brad and Judy
told me of your little mutiny.

21:27.369 --> 21:30.370
So, last night
while you were asleep,

21:30.438 --> 21:33.674
I put mutated cobra larvae
in your spine.

21:33.741 --> 21:36.844
Every time I press this button,

21:36.912 --> 21:39.680
a little venom is released.

21:39.748 --> 21:42.182
So, as you can see,

21:42.250 --> 21:44.251
or feel,

21:44.319 --> 21:46.854
I'm still very much in control.

21:46.922 --> 21:50.191
You do as I say.

21:50.258 --> 21:54.996
First, we steal the planospheric
disc from the kinder,

21:55.064 --> 21:58.400
then we destroy them.

21:58.468 --> 22:00.069
Ah ha ha ha ha ha!

22:00.137 --> 22:02.705
Ah ha ha ha ha!

22:02.772 --> 22:04.907
We destroy them...

22:04.975 --> 22:07.042
Ah ha ha ha ha!

22:08.159 --> 22:19.197
