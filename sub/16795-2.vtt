HEIDI:
<i> Previously on</i> Project Runway...

00:02.001 --> 00:03.335
I want to welcome all of you

00:03.371 --> 00:05.170
to season 15 of <i> Project Runway.</i>

00:05.205 --> 00:06.971
(cheering)

00:07.007 --> 00:10.041
It is an unconventional
materials challenge.

00:10.077 --> 00:12.278
Whatever we decorated
this beautiful party with

00:12.313 --> 00:14.112
are your materials.

00:14.148 --> 00:16.615
Let's go!

00:18.319 --> 00:19.785
(laughing):
Oh, my God.

00:24.124 --> 00:26.158
-Wow.
-I got the color that I wanted.

00:26.193 --> 00:27.392
TIM:
You certainly did.

00:27.427 --> 00:29.561
Think about expanding this.

00:29.596 --> 00:30.662
I hate volume.

00:32.566 --> 00:34.399
-There you go.
-I'm panicking.

00:39.740 --> 00:41.840
It was a runway piece.

00:41.875 --> 00:43.541
And it worked.

00:43.577 --> 00:45.443
ZAC: This was one of my favorite
pieces I've seen

00:45.478 --> 00:47.913
-in many seasons.
-HEIDI: Erin, congratulations.

00:47.948 --> 00:49.147
You are the winner

00:49.183 --> 00:51.482
-of the first challenge.
-Thanks, guys.

00:51.518 --> 00:55.486
Brik, there was a big disconnect
to your look.

00:55.522 --> 00:59.457
Ian, the final look was
uninspiring and underwhelming.

01:02.763 --> 01:04.662
Sorry, that m¶ ¶s you're out.

01:07.400 --> 01:09.367
¶ ¶

01:12.439 --> 01:15.373
SARAH:
<i> I am so excited that we are in</i>

01:15.409 --> 01:17.108
this room with Erin
because she is

01:17.144 --> 01:19.277
-our good-luck charm. This is
the winner's room. -(whooping)

01:19.313 --> 01:20.611
We are all gonna win
a challenge.

01:20.647 --> 01:22.113
ERIN:
It feels like it's, like,

01:22.149 --> 01:23.949
so cool to be able to, like,

01:23.984 --> 01:26.784
kick off a season
with first win.

01:26.820 --> 01:28.853
<i> It is so wild</i>

01:28.888 --> 01:30.221
being the first winner.

01:30.257 --> 01:31.656
<i> It wasn't, like, this,</i>
<i> like, amazing surprise,</i>

01:31.691 --> 01:33.558
but I was up against
some other people where

01:33.593 --> 01:35.126
<i> their stuff was good, too,</i>
<i> but either way,</i>

01:35.162 --> 01:37.662
I'm very honored.
(chuckles)

01:37.697 --> 01:39.931
BRIK: One of the things
that I messed up on...

01:39.967 --> 01:42.000
Who was my girl? 'Cause, like,
thinking back, it was like,

01:42.035 --> 01:43.734
well, yeah, who the hell
was she, right?

01:43.770 --> 01:45.170
This is a new challenge,
a new day.

01:45.205 --> 01:46.771
Just take from the experience,

01:46.806 --> 01:49.207
-and don't let it happen again.
-Right.

01:49.242 --> 01:51.609
Today I feel determined

01:51.644 --> 01:54.745
<i> to not repeat the same mistakes</i>
<i> I made yesterday.</i>

01:54.781 --> 01:57.415
Um, yeah.

01:57.451 --> 01:59.217
I'm always in a room
full of ready-to-wear designers

01:59.252 --> 02:01.286
cutting me apart for doing
the editorial stuff that I do,

02:01.321 --> 02:03.288
so I'm not surprised that
there's a bunch of shady haters

02:03.323 --> 02:04.755
-running around in here.
-Right.

02:04.791 --> 02:06.157
Giving me the business
when I turn my back

02:06.159 --> 02:07.425
sm atild in ming cey e

02:09.829 --> 02:11.162
ir t <i> has</i> But I found out <i>I </i> s <i>eadid.</i>
from 80% of the designers

02:11.198 --> 02:12.964
<i> that Cornelius,</i>
<i> he was talking mad (bleep)</i>

02:13.000 --> 02:14.699
<i> about my stuff on the runway.</i>

02:14.734 --> 02:16.201
I think you might need
to turn this light up,

02:16.236 --> 02:18.203
'cause I'm sensing some shade
coming from across the room.

02:18.238 --> 02:19.604
MAH-JING:
<i> Cornelius was</i>

02:19.639 --> 02:21.072
talking trash about Dexter.

02:21.108 --> 02:23.141
<i> Usually people who have less</i>
<i> talent make fun of others.</i>

02:23.176 --> 02:25.643
He is a mean boy.

02:25.678 --> 02:26.911
I'm just glad we're all
still in here...

02:26.946 --> 02:28.313
ALEX:
Definitely.

02:28.348 --> 02:29.814
I don't know
about the other ones, but...

02:29.849 --> 02:31.949
I was happy to be safe.

02:31.985 --> 02:34.619
-I don't think safe is bad.
-It's not an option for me,

02:34.654 --> 02:36.221
I'm sorry to say it.

02:36.256 --> 02:38.123
That's ridiculous.

02:38.158 --> 02:39.657
Safe is better than going home,

02:39.692 --> 02:41.926
but being on the top
is even better than that.

02:41.961 --> 02:44.229
<i> There's a couple of things</i>
<i> that should be on the bottom,</i>

02:44.264 --> 02:45.997
and I know it's not mine.

02:46.033 --> 02:48.699
¶ ¶

02:48.735 --> 02:50.168
Ooh.

02:50.203 --> 02:52.803
(contestants exclaiming)

02:52.839 --> 02:54.072
HEIDI:
Oh, hi!

02:54.107 --> 02:55.473
(laughter)

02:55.509 --> 02:57.242
-Hi, guys.
-ALL: Hi.

02:57.277 --> 02:59.477
Congratulations on surviving

02:59.513 --> 03:00.878
your first
<i> Project Runway</i> challenge.

03:00.914 --> 03:02.247
(applause)

03:03.783 --> 03:04.749
I know that this first challenge

03:04.784 --> 03:07.752
really tired you out,
and you all

03:07.787 --> 03:09.954
look like you could use
a little fresh air.

03:09.989 --> 03:11.322
-(contestants murmuring)
-Oh, man.

03:11.358 --> 03:14.259
Well, Tim and a special guest
are waiting for you

03:14.294 --> 03:17.162
at a park and they will tell you
all about your next challenge.

03:17.197 --> 03:20.065
And I promise you
that today will be

03:20.100 --> 03:22.900
(singsongy):
fabulous.

03:22.936 --> 03:25.903
-Ooh, I like that.
-(murmuring, chuckling)

03:25.939 --> 03:27.705
LAURENCE:
<i> I hope that whatever it is,</i>

03:27.740 --> 03:29.174
I do not have to run,
because

03:29.209 --> 03:30.808
<i> I twisted my ankle</i>

03:30.843 --> 03:32.243
twerking last night.

03:32.279 --> 03:33.978
(laughs)

03:34.013 --> 03:35.947
I wish you all good luck
and I'll see you back

03:35.982 --> 03:37.882
here on the runway.
Bye, guys.

03:37.917 --> 03:39.284
ALL: Bye.

03:41.921 --> 03:44.255
¶ ¶

03:49.296 --> 03:50.861
Good morning, designers.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.263
ALL: Good morning, Tim.

03:52.299 --> 03:55.633
I am delighted to welcome
a very special guest,

03:55.668 --> 03:57.602
the chief marketing officer
of JustFab,

03:57.637 --> 04:00.105
-Traci Inglis. Traci, welcome.
-(applause)

04:00.140 --> 04:01.872
-We're thrilled to have you
here. -TRACI: Thank you.

04:01.908 --> 04:04.242
Hi, designers.
I'm so excited to be here

04:04.277 --> 04:05.610
in New York City,

04:05.645 --> 04:06.777
presenting you with your

04:06.813 --> 04:08.679
JustFab challenge.

04:08.715 --> 04:10.815
JustFab is my jam.

04:10.850 --> 04:12.016
JustFab.

04:12.051 --> 04:14.085
On the island of Manhattan,

04:14.121 --> 04:18.022
there are four million women
and more who are getting dressed

04:18.057 --> 04:19.957
every single morning.

04:19.993 --> 04:22.860
TRACI: JustFab's goal is
to make women of every age,

04:22.895 --> 04:27.198
every height, every size,
look and feel fabulous.

04:27.234 --> 04:28.866
And today, designers,

04:28.901 --> 04:30.901
-that's where you come in.
-Indeed.

04:35.008 --> 04:37.575
-(contestants murmuring)
-CORNELIUS: What's going on?

04:37.611 --> 04:40.011
Oh, wow.
There's a lot of them.

04:40.046 --> 04:41.312
Hey, ladies.

04:41.348 --> 04:43.314
TASHA: <i> Here comes</i>
<i> this army of women.</i>

04:43.350 --> 04:46.384
<i> I mean, it's women coming</i>
<i> from the left, from the right,</i>

04:46.419 --> 04:47.352
from the north side, south side,

04:47.387 --> 04:49.220
<i> women coming everywhere,</i>

04:49.256 --> 04:49.954
looking like a video.

04:49.989 --> 04:51.623
Yes.

04:52.825 --> 04:55.059
-Oh, snap.
-BRIK: Oh, my.

04:55.128 --> 04:57.795
KIMBER: <i> These ladies, like,</i>
<i> came out of nowhere, even</i>

04:57.830 --> 04:59.830
some of the women
that was sitting on a bench

04:59.866 --> 05:00.731
started getting up, I was like,

05:00.767 --> 05:02.933
<i> "Oh, (bleep)."</i>
(chuckles)

05:02.969 --> 05:05.503
I knew these women had something
to do with it, I knew it.

05:05.539 --> 05:09.307
Here we have 100 women
of all ages, all sizes,

05:09.342 --> 05:11.976
and they are all fabulous.

05:12.011 --> 05:14.579

a TAC kresedsin the enof
s womathohoabusp .tF

05:16.650 --> 05:19.884
All women.
We are fab for all.

05:19.919 --> 05:22.320
Your challenge is to
create a look that could make

05:22.355 --> 05:25.223
any of these women, any size,
any shape, any age,

05:25.258 --> 05:27.825
feel like the most fabulous
version of herself.

05:27.860 --> 05:29.860
<i> The challenge is</i>
<i> to create a look that</i>

05:29.896 --> 05:32.664
can speak
to a variety of ladies.

05:32.699 --> 05:33.798
Wow.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.166
<i> The everyday woman is</i>

05:35.202 --> 05:37.101
a woman who is on the go--

05:37.136 --> 05:40.705
<i> a mom, a businesswoman,</i>
<i> a wife--</i>

05:40.740 --> 05:42.473
in a lot of ways, it's,
it's myself.

05:42.509 --> 05:44.709
Please remember that versatility

05:44.744 --> 05:47.245
and diversity
among your clientele

05:47.280 --> 05:48.813
does not mean humdrum.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.981
You are creating fashion.

05:51.017 --> 05:51.982
All right?

05:52.018 --> 05:52.883
TRACI:
That's the key,

05:52.919 --> 05:55.553
because...

05:55.589 --> 05:59.290
we are going to reproduce
and sell the winning look on

05:59.326 --> 06:01.292
-JustFab.com.
-Oh, my God...

06:01.328 --> 06:03.261
(cheers, applause)

06:03.296 --> 06:04.295
CORNELIUS:
<i> I just graduated</i>

06:04.331 --> 06:06.130
college, and to get

06:06.165 --> 06:07.832
<i> my outfit featured in JustFab</i>

06:07.867 --> 06:09.400
would be absolutely amazing.

06:09.436 --> 06:12.270
BRIK: <i> I'm excited about this</i>
<i> challenge. At the same time,</i>

06:12.305 --> 06:13.904
I'm wary, you know?

06:13.940 --> 06:16.474
Like, if-if I understand
the meaning of that word,

06:16.509 --> 06:18.008
'cause I can't Google right now.

06:18.044 --> 06:20.478
So, designers,
you have 30 minutes to sketch,

06:20.513 --> 06:22.247
and then we're making
our first trip to Mood,

06:22.282 --> 06:25.283
where you will
have a budget of $150.

06:25.318 --> 06:27.118
And this is a one-day challenge.

06:27.153 --> 06:29.887
You will be presenting your work
to the judges tomorrow.

06:29.922 --> 06:31.289
TRACI: Good luck, designers.
I can't wait to see

06:31.324 --> 06:32.323
what you come up with.

06:32.359 --> 06:33.424
Let's get sketching!

06:36.162 --> 06:38.296
ALEX: <i> There's nothing</i>
<i> more spectacular</i>

06:38.331 --> 06:40.465
<i> to me, as a designer, than</i>

06:40.533 --> 06:42.567
working with the everyday woman.

06:42.602 --> 06:44.935
I think of my mom,
I think of my stepmother.

06:44.971 --> 06:48.273
<i> So, I start sketching</i>
<i> a pair of pants</i>

06:48.308 --> 06:49.907
<i> with more of a designed pleat,</i>

06:49.942 --> 06:54.178
<i> and a basic tank top</i>
<i> with a great sheer top.</i>

06:54.213 --> 06:56.814
<i> I am simply pumped.</i>

06:56.849 --> 06:58.716
I want to do, like,
a jacket and denim.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.518
-JENNI: Mm.
-I just hope I have time.

07:00.553 --> 07:01.919
I might do kind of, like,
a lazy jumper.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.790
<i> First thing I think about</i>
<i> is versatility.</i>

07:05.825 --> 07:07.759
So, I'm sketching this

07:07.794 --> 07:10.261
<i> tunic with cute little</i>
<i> raglan sleeves.</i>

07:10.297 --> 07:12.997
<i> I want there to be this really</i>
<i> cool detail on the belt.</i>

07:13.032 --> 07:14.432
<i> But then, it has, like, snaps,</i>

07:14.467 --> 07:16.801
<i> so you can snap it</i>
<i> and make it a poof skirt.</i>

07:16.836 --> 07:18.235
<i> Also, it can be for</i>
<i> the same kind of girl</i>

07:18.271 --> 07:19.771
who wants to eat
a bunch of snacks

07:19.806 --> 07:21.205
and then maybe,
by the end of the night,

07:21.240 --> 07:23.374
wants to put on, like,
some heels and go out.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.514
<i> I'm designing a jumpsuit.</i>
<i> When I do sketch,</i>

07:29.549 --> 07:30.948
<i> it's just to give me an idea of</i>

07:30.983 --> 07:34.319
<i> where I will go,</i>
<i> but I sketch and then I tweak.</i>

07:34.354 --> 07:35.787
It changes all the time.

07:37.990 --> 07:41.158
<i> I'm seeing all these</i>
<i> architectural wonders.</i>

07:41.194 --> 07:44.161
<i> The coat I'm gonna make</i>
<i> is transparent, but also</i>

07:44.197 --> 07:47.298
<i> represents us being</i>
<i> in New York.</i>

07:47.334 --> 07:50.000
That's kind of influencing
the decisions I'm making

07:50.036 --> 07:51.135
<i> for my garment.</i>

07:52.539 --> 07:54.071
<i> I'm gonna make this cool</i>

07:54.106 --> 07:55.540
<i> denim jacket with</i>

07:55.575 --> 07:57.308
<i> the net-print pullover pant.</i>

07:57.344 --> 07:59.410
<i> My JustFab girl</i>

07:59.446 --> 08:02.513
goes all out, even whenever
it's to the grocery store.

08:03.483 --> 08:04.515
All right, designers,

08:04.551 --> 08:06.517
we are headed to Mood.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.052
-(contestants whooping)
-Our first trip.

08:08.087 --> 08:09.354
Follow me, everyone.

08:11.924 --> 08:13.558
TIM:
All right, designers.

08:13.593 --> 08:15.159
You have your budget of $150,

08:15.194 --> 08:16.894
and you have 30 minutes to shop.

08:16.929 --> 08:19.029
And your time starts... now!

08:19.065 --> 08:21.632
¶ ¶

08:25.538 --> 08:26.804
I really wanted to go for volume

08:26.840 --> 08:28.706
<i> with this dress,</i>
<i> so I got neoprene</i>

08:28.742 --> 08:30.074
<i> in the two colors</i>
<i> that I wanted:</i>

08:30.109 --> 08:31.609
<i> this beautiful coral red...</i>

08:31.644 --> 08:33.344
And then also, I guess,
this one, too.

08:33.380 --> 08:35.980
<i> ...and then this, sort of,</i>
<i> baby blue</i>

08:36.015 --> 08:37.014
for the base of the dress.

08:37.049 --> 08:39.350
Come on, muscles. (groans).

08:40.553 --> 08:42.620
<i> The first thing I go for</i>

08:42.655 --> 08:44.389
is skin; I like leather.

08:44.424 --> 08:46.824
Hold on before you cut it.

08:46.860 --> 08:49.059
They do not have
what I'm looking for,

08:49.095 --> 08:52.630
<i> so I... I find this beautiful</i>
<i> army green fabric.</i>

08:52.665 --> 08:54.999
The weight is perfect
for what I want to do.

08:55.034 --> 08:56.901
Give me the one more yard.

08:56.936 --> 09:00.304
TIM: Designers,
you have 15 minutes remaining.

09:01.608 --> 09:03.340
-I like this.
-(chuckles)

09:04.944 --> 09:05.976
Wait, are these real fur?

09:06.012 --> 09:07.845
-CLERK: A fox. Real fox.
-They're... Oh.

09:07.881 --> 09:08.813
Hmm, okay.

09:08.848 --> 09:09.881
<i> I'm like</i>

09:09.916 --> 09:11.282
a dog that sees a squirrel.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.249
Squirrel? Squirrel?

09:12.285 --> 09:13.851
<i> I had to make sure</i>

09:13.887 --> 09:15.185
to stay focused.

09:15.221 --> 09:17.054
Oh, thank you very much.

09:17.089 --> 09:18.923
<i> And I didn't even have time</i>
<i> to really...</i>

09:18.991 --> 09:20.825
have a backup plan
or anything like that.

09:23.496 --> 09:26.096
-Thank you.
-TIM: Time is up!

09:26.132 --> 09:27.298
Thank you so much.

09:27.333 --> 09:29.333
-Have a great day.
-Yeah, have a good one now.

09:29.368 --> 09:31.101
TIM:
Swatch, eyes here.

09:31.137 --> 09:32.102
(all laugh)

09:32.138 --> 09:33.370
All right, designers,

09:33.406 --> 09:34.672
let's head back to the workroom.

09:34.707 --> 09:36.106
(contestants cheering)

09:36.142 --> 09:37.408
TIM:
Thank you, Mood.

09:39.512 --> 09:41.679
-Oh.
-(mouthing)

09:41.714 --> 09:42.847
Let's do this.

09:45.752 --> 09:47.618
This part, right here, is gonna
be, like, fuzzy, like fur.

09:47.654 --> 09:50.321
And then a drop crotch, like,
jumpsuit underneath.

09:50.356 --> 09:51.556
-If I have time.
-That's dope.

09:51.591 --> 09:53.591
Look at this vibration.

09:53.626 --> 09:55.593
-Ooh, that's nice.
-I know.

09:55.628 --> 09:58.362
(overlapping chatter)

09:58.397 --> 10:01.165
All right, you have a lot
of work ahead of you, everyone.

10:01.200 --> 10:03.033
I will be back later
for critiques.

10:03.069 --> 10:05.235
You will have a model fitting
after that,

10:05.271 --> 10:07.972
and remember, you have until
1:00 in the morning.

10:08.007 --> 10:09.073
All right?
And tomorrow is our runway.

10:09.108 --> 10:10.708
-Wow.
-I will see you

10:10.743 --> 10:12.910
for critiques later.
Work, work, work.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.445
And enjoy
the Brother sewing room.

10:14.481 --> 10:16.013
ALL: Thank you.

10:21.788 --> 10:23.855
I'm a high waist pant designer.

10:23.857 --> 10:25.022
A lot  times,

10:25.057 --> 10:26.557
I'm a hit contours this.signer.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.125
-Everything.
-And you see

10:28.160 --> 10:29.994
so many young girls,
they have muffin tops...

10:31.698 --> 10:34.398
JENNI: I hate that.
One size does not fit all.

10:36.202 --> 10:38.268
Your kids are gonna be
so proud of you.

10:38.304 --> 10:39.704
(Linda chuckles)

10:39.739 --> 10:42.573
-I mean, you are rocking this.
-Oh, thank you.

10:42.942 --> 10:47.044

11:01.127 --> 11:03.661
I always tell them

11:03.696 --> 11:05.229
You know, even if
you don't make it,

11:05.264 --> 11:06.497
then you learn something
along the way.

11:06.533 --> 11:09.767
<i> I want to win this competition</i>

11:09.802 --> 11:12.670
because I want them

-NATHALIA: Oh... Teach me more.

11:39.933 --> 11:41.465
Although I'm getting rid
of that pattern,

11:41.500 --> 11:43.200
I don't want anybody else
using it.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.802
(giggles)

NATHALIA: Whatever drama
you guys have going,

11:51.544 --> 11:53.611
just, like, I don't even want
to be, like, a part of it,

11:53.646 --> 11:56.180

to do with me, you know?

11:56.215 --> 11:57.782
<i> Cornelius don't play, yeah.</i>

11:57.817 --> 12:00.117
He'll claw you real quick.

12:00.152 --> 12:02.787
I was like,
"I don't understand." (scoffs)

12:02.822 --> 12:04.488

12:04.523 --> 12:05.422

Everyone's already told me that
he was talking mad (bleep)

12:13.365 --> 12:14.832
about my dress.
I'm not really here for that.

12:14.867 --> 12:16.968
No one's talking (bleep)
about him.

<i> I don't know</i>

competition knows he's talking

12:21.574 --> 12:22.539

12:24.978 --> 12:27.111
He just loves to throw people
under the bus.

12:27.146 --> 12:29.179
He's a A-hole.
(chuckles)

12:29.215 --> 12:30.114
I ain't got time for him.

12:31.484 --> 12:32.416

-It's bossin', bossin' out?
-I don't even know how,

it's (bleep) good,
'cause it was so bad last night.

14:26.532 --> 14:29.367
Right. Maybe because you
slept on it and weren't...

14:29.402 --> 14:30.567

LAURENCE:
<i> I went to school for fashion</i>

14:33.706 --> 14:35.406
<i> in Paris for about six years.</i>

14:35.441 --> 14:38.442
And I stopped,
I went on a modeling career

14:38.478 --> 14:40.878
<i> for 15 years.</i>
<i> And, uh, I restarted</i>

14:40.946 --> 14:42.446
<i> designing about five years ago.</i>

14:42.482 --> 14:45.116
<i> I think I was, like, eight</i>
<i> months pregnant when I, uh...</i>

14:45.151 --> 14:47.651
when I entered fashion school.
Nobody knew.

14:47.686 --> 14:49.586
<i> And having a kid at 16 was</i>

14:49.622 --> 14:52.123
<i> the craziest experience</i>
<i> of my life.</i>

14:52.158 --> 14:53.724
<i> It was tough.</i>

14:53.759 --> 14:57.094
So my dad actually, um, find out

14:57.130 --> 14:59.030
couple weeks
before I give birth,

14:59.065 --> 15:00.564
and, um,

15:00.599 --> 15:03.067
I was no longer his daughter,
so he cut me off.

15:03.102 --> 15:04.935
<i> He passed away in '07.</i>

15:04.970 --> 15:06.203
<i> We never talked.</i>

15:06.239 --> 15:08.439
<i> We never talked again,</i>
<i> since I was 16.</i>

15:08.508 --> 15:11.175
I had to make peace with that.

15:11.210 --> 15:16.747
<i> My dad was my best friend.</i>

15:19.485 --> 15:21.585
<i> But it's all good today.</i>

15:21.620 --> 15:23.521
<i> Me and my daughter, we close.</i>

15:23.556 --> 15:25.289
So, I guess it was worth it.

-How is everyone?
-ALL: Good.

15:37.736 --> 15:40.504
-I'm eager to see what you're
doing. -ERIN: Me, too.

15:40.540 --> 15:43.541
So, Alex, you were
the first designer

15:43.576 --> 15:45.076
finished at Mood.

15:45.111 --> 15:46.377
Yeah, I ran through that place.

15:46.412 --> 15:47.744
But you really knew
what you were doing.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.246
You were dogged and determined.

15:49.282 --> 15:51.382
And this list is fantastic.

15:51.417 --> 15:53.484
ALEX:
Color-coded everything.

15:53.519 --> 15:55.319
-Is this how you always work?
-Yeah.

15:55.354 --> 15:57.721
-Well, my hat's off to you.
-ALEX: <i> I'm very OCD.</i>

15:57.756 --> 15:59.123
If it's not perfect, it's not...

15:59.158 --> 16:00.424
it's not good to me.

16:00.460 --> 16:02.460
I wanted to kind of
make a play of, like,

16:02.495 --> 16:04.328
-a nice, tapered pant.
-Uh-huh.

16:04.363 --> 16:06.363
That had a little bit of a
structural quality to it.

16:06.399 --> 16:08.566
-Okay.
-And then I'm doing

16:08.601 --> 16:10.701
a chiffon button-down,

16:10.736 --> 16:12.436
and just a basic camisole
underneath.

16:12.472 --> 16:14.071
TIM:
Okay.

16:14.107 --> 16:15.506
I think it's a really great

16:15.541 --> 16:18.175
-pant design.
-Thank you.

16:18.211 --> 16:19.343
What concerns do you have?

16:19.378 --> 16:20.578
I wasn't happy with
my construction

16:20.613 --> 16:22.213
on the last challenge.

16:22.248 --> 16:23.981
Where did you see the flaws?

16:24.016 --> 16:26.550
-I'm just a... a critical, I...
-All right, but be careful.

16:26.586 --> 16:27.985
-I mean, these are one-day
challenges. -I know.

16:28.020 --> 16:29.786
There's only so much
you can achieve.

16:29.822 --> 16:31.489
Tim is picking up on the fact

16:31.524 --> 16:33.357
that I'm very hard on myself.

16:33.392 --> 16:36.360
<i> I'm a perfectionist,</i>
<i> but I'm a--</i>

16:36.395 --> 16:38.329
<i> I need to be a perfectionist</i>
<i> within time restraints.</i>

16:38.364 --> 16:39.696
<i> I need to</i>

16:39.732 --> 16:41.865
not be so hard on myself,

16:41.900 --> 16:44.268
because I'm gonna become
my own worst enemy.

16:44.303 --> 16:45.936
-How's our winner?
-How are you?

16:45.971 --> 16:48.239
I'm good. I'm eager to hear
what you're doing.

16:48.274 --> 16:51.642
-Um... -Who do you see
the JustFab woman being?

16:51.677 --> 16:53.477
So, I was a--
I was really inspired

16:53.513 --> 16:54.845
by all of the women there today.

16:54.880 --> 16:56.747
The first thing
I thought about was,

16:56.782 --> 16:58.982
like, how to kind of,
like, maybe change,

16:59.018 --> 17:02.386
like, a garment so it could be
two-- like, worn two ways.

17:02.421 --> 17:05.422
-So, I kind of wanted to take
this fitted top. -Okay.

17:05.458 --> 17:07.223
And then, like, it could be,
like, this sort of, like,

17:07.260 --> 17:10.493
tent dress, but then
have this, uh, mechanism,

17:10.530 --> 17:12.195
where, like, it'll be like
a snap underneath this panel,

17:12.231 --> 17:13.564
-pull it over...
-Oh, so you could...

17:13.598 --> 17:15.766
-You can wear it two ways.
-What's that?

17:15.800 --> 17:17.535
So, then this is what I want
to do for the panels.

17:17.569 --> 17:19.736
So, I want to fold it in.

17:19.771 --> 17:22.239
-So this'll be, like, red on top
of that. -You know,

17:22.275 --> 17:23.473
I'm not understanding
the sequins.

17:23.509 --> 17:25.108
Are you taking what is

17:25.144 --> 17:26.843
a very sporty dress

17:26.878 --> 17:29.280
and committing it to cocktails?

17:29.315 --> 17:32.516
Well, I just wanted to have
there to be, like,

17:32.552 --> 17:34.017
a dash of cocktail.

17:34.053 --> 17:35.553
Tim tells me he doesn't think
that I really need

17:35.588 --> 17:37.254
<i> the sequin,</i>
<i> but I'm kind of like...</i>

17:37.290 --> 17:38.789
glitter.

17:38.824 --> 17:40.624
Always like that shimmer.

17:40.660 --> 17:42.493
I really like to just, like,
when I get a textile,

17:42.528 --> 17:44.795
to not, like, take it for,
like, face value

17:44.830 --> 17:46.497
but add, like, a little bit
more to it.

17:46.532 --> 17:47.898
All right, I mean,

17:47.933 --> 17:49.833
I like your expl-- your
explanation, I-I get it.

17:49.868 --> 17:51.802
Glitter always.
(laughs)

17:51.837 --> 17:53.103
-Tasha.
-Hey, boss man.

17:53.138 --> 17:54.638
(laughs)

17:54.674 --> 17:56.006
-Is that my nickname?
-That's your nickname.

17:56.041 --> 17:58.542
-Thank you, I'm very flattered.
-My JustFab girl

17:58.578 --> 18:00.678
-is the girl that's on a budget.
-What's the shape of the skirt?

18:00.713 --> 18:03.347
-Just a straight skirt.
-I'm just wondering,

18:03.382 --> 18:04.448
is this personal enough?

18:04.483 --> 18:06.183
Hmm.

18:06.219 --> 18:08.185
I was gonna do
a play on menswear.

18:08.221 --> 18:09.886
Okay.

18:09.922 --> 18:12.489
And then just do, like,
a button-up, um, shirt dress.

18:12.491 --> 18:12.590
Well, I-I have to tell you,
I have a-a personal

18:17.430 --> 18:19.263

And then just do, like,
aAnd I love this riff on it..

18:19.298 --> 18:20.431
I don't know, like,
the drop crotch thing

18:20.466 --> 18:21.932
is totally my thing.

18:21.967 --> 18:23.267
I'm just worried how the judges

18:27.840 --> 18:29.473
-Right. Got to take a chance.
-Right.

18:29.508 --> 18:31.775
JENNI: <i> I'm a really big fan</i>
<i> of the drop crotch.</i>

18:31.810 --> 18:33.777
My grandma says that it looks
like someone (bleep) themselves.

18:33.812 --> 18:35.312
(laughs)

18:35.348 --> 18:36.913
DIRECTOR:
About the pants you make?

18:36.949 --> 18:38.549
About the pants I make,
but they're so cute.

18:38.584 --> 18:40.150
I love them.

18:40.185 --> 18:41.619
-I'm arrested immediately.
-(chuckles)

18:41.654 --> 18:42.753
You have a knit.

18:42.788 --> 18:44.588
My idea is, um...

18:44.624 --> 18:46.189
urban kimono.

18:46.225 --> 18:48.425
I find, in my own life,
that I need

18:48.461 --> 18:50.494
-versatile clothing.
-I use that word repeatedly.

18:50.529 --> 18:51.795
"Versatile."

18:51.830 --> 18:53.830
-This is gonna be
underneath a coat. -Oh.

18:53.999 --> 18:55.566
A kiee

I'm going to have almost
mimicking this hole,

18:58.871 --> 19:00.237
-a very small opening here.
-Mm-hmm.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.773
It gives it a little bit of...
drama.

19:02.841 --> 19:04.808
LAURENCE:
<i> When I see Linda's fabric</i>

19:04.843 --> 19:06.710
<i> for this challenge,</i>
<i> I'm already thinking that it's,</i>

19:06.746 --> 19:07.978
it's, uh, it's a wrong move.

19:08.013 --> 19:09.846
<i> Knitwear shows everything,</i>

19:09.882 --> 19:11.248
<i> and it's not flattering.</i>

19:11.284 --> 19:13.250
-And you're feeling good,
I can tell. -Um,

19:13.286 --> 19:15.519
-I'm getting there. (chuckles)
-Okay.

19:15.554 --> 19:17.821
I'm hoping my design
will stand out to the judges,

19:17.856 --> 19:19.323
and I also hope

19:19.358 --> 19:22.192
<i> the versatility of my design</i>
<i> and my coat</i>

19:22.227 --> 19:24.461
ll
be appealing
to a lot of women.

19:24.497 --> 19:27.097
So, um, it's going
to be a dress.

19:27.132 --> 19:30.401
I wanted it to have this
structural piece in the back,

19:30.436 --> 19:31.802
so from the side,

19:31.837 --> 19:33.837
the judges will get,
like, a visual of maybe

19:33.872 --> 19:35.539
even like a hood,
but it's really not.

19:35.574 --> 19:37.007
Right.

19:37.042 --> 19:38.442
'Cause I don't want to
be safe anymore.

19:38.477 --> 19:40.444
I have to, like, get up there.

19:40.479 --> 19:41.945
I think that

19:41.980 --> 19:44.782
this black and white piece

19:44.817 --> 19:46.617
should be a separate.

19:46.652 --> 19:49.286
-Mm-hmm. -It just gives them
more options.

19:49.322 --> 19:51.722
Given the innovation
of the jacket,

19:51.757 --> 19:54.458
is the skirt too basic?

19:54.493 --> 19:56.993
Having this skirt that has this

19:57.029 --> 19:58.462
very screaming pattern, it's...

19:58.497 --> 19:59.730
-You're...
-I-I think it's very busy.

19:59.765 --> 20:01.632
That is the right answer.

20:01.667 --> 20:03.166
I was going to do it
in red, like,

20:03.202 --> 20:05.068
a reddish-orange,
but the denim was

20:05.103 --> 20:07.604
-speaking to me more.
-This design

20:07.640 --> 20:10.941
is so much more impactful

20:10.976 --> 20:12.409
executed in this denim.

20:12.445 --> 20:14.678
-Okay.
-You have the potential here

20:14.714 --> 20:16.780
to really knock
people's socks off.

20:18.617 --> 20:19.650
Laurence, how are you doing?

20:19.685 --> 20:20.851
-Hi.
-Hi.

20:20.886 --> 20:22.653
Made a lot of progress.

20:22.688 --> 20:23.654
Yeah, I'm making a jumpsuit.

20:23.689 --> 20:24.655
It's going to be a little

20:24.690 --> 20:25.989
drop crotch, not that much,

20:26.024 --> 20:28.659
uh, tapered in the bottom,

20:28.694 --> 20:29.960
with the bottoms maybe
on the inside of the jumpsuit.

20:29.995 --> 20:32.563
-Mm-hmm.
-Yeah, so...

20:32.598 --> 20:34.631
The-the pants in the sketch
have a lot of volume.

20:34.667 --> 20:36.066
What will they actually be like?

20:36.101 --> 20:37.234
I don't want this to be fitted,

20:37.269 --> 20:38.669
I want this to be
straight-formed.

20:38.704 --> 20:40.571
-Okay.
-But a little loose.

20:40.606 --> 20:42.840
The looseness in the fit
of the garment

20:42.875 --> 20:45.542
is not gonna be
particularly flattering

20:45.578 --> 20:47.511
to a lot of, in particular,

20:47.546 --> 20:48.779
-larger women.
-Mm-hmm.

20:48.814 --> 20:50.481
Uh, because, one of
my own refrains is

20:50.516 --> 20:52.349
-the more volume
your clothes have, -Yeah.

20:52.385 --> 20:54.451
-the more volume
you appear to have. -Yeah.

20:54.487 --> 20:55.753
How flattering will it be on

20:55.788 --> 20:58.822
someone who's petite,

20:58.858 --> 21:03.026
someone who's larger
than a twelve?

21:03.061 --> 21:04.762
-Um....

BRIK: <i> </i>

22:11.163 --> 22:12.596
And modern.

22:12.631 --> 22:14.998
This is, like,
the base of a jacket.

22:15.033 --> 22:17.601
I also have this leather

22:17.636 --> 22:19.670
that I was thinking of using
as a shoulder treatment.

22:19.705 --> 22:22.840
And then a pant,
I wanted to do a,

22:22.875 --> 22:26.643
-a firm knit pull-on pant.
-Ah. Tell me,

22:26.679 --> 22:29.179
-really bluntly, about this.
-About the leather?

22:29.214 --> 22:30.347
And w you wod

22:30.383 --> 22:31.849
I was thinking like this,

having a sort of...

22:34.052 --> 22:36.253
maybe it's too <i> Blade Runner.</i>
I don't know.

-All right.

-Thank you, Tim.
-JENNI: <i> Brik has to step it up.</i>

22:53.839 --> 22:55.806
I feel like Brik
could be in trouble.

22:55.841 --> 22:58.609
<i> I honestly feel</i>
<i> if Brik doesn't</i>

22:58.644 --> 23:00.844
turn things around now,
it could really be detrimental

23:00.880 --> 23:02.446
<i> to his future.</i>

23:02.481 --> 23:05.282
So, I want to do, like,
an elongated, uh, bomber

23:05.317 --> 23:06.283
with a backwards kimono sleeve.

23:06.318 --> 23:08.351
And then a dress.

23:08.387 --> 23:10.954
Could you see this
as a coat dress?

23:10.989 --> 23:12.856
-Yes.
-Why don't you?

23:12.892 --> 23:14.157
Okay.

23:14.192 --> 23:17.294
I'm making a jacket
and some leggings.

23:17.329 --> 23:19.696
-This mesh back...
-So, it's an open back.

23:19.732 --> 23:21.932
Because I plan on doing
a sports bra,

23:21.967 --> 23:23.634
with some straps in the back.

23:23.669 --> 23:25.903
Are you overdesigning this?

23:25.938 --> 23:26.904
I don't think so.

23:26.939 --> 23:28.204
It's just looking a little

23:28.240 --> 23:30.541
like a cartoon.

23:30.576 --> 23:35.111
Can I ask you to hold
this black textile up?

23:35.147 --> 23:36.447
Yeah.

23:36.482 --> 23:37.380
To cover up the green?

23:37.416 --> 23:39.550
Oh, yes, okay.

23:40.986 --> 23:43.219
That looks more modern.

23:43.255 --> 23:44.220
Would you mind repeating that?

23:44.256 --> 23:45.556
SARAH: It looks more modern.

23:46.926 --> 23:48.291
-Hi, Tim.
-Good heavens, Kimber,

23:48.327 --> 23:50.060
you're all organized.

23:50.095 --> 23:51.394
Talk to me.

23:51.430 --> 23:53.764
I am not ready to meet Tim

23:53.799 --> 23:56.433
and listen to him critique
what I'm doing.

23:56.469 --> 23:57.601
I am so not ready.

23:57.636 --> 23:59.069
This is what I'm gonna do.

23:59.104 --> 24:00.604
-A high-waist pant.
-Okay.

24:00.639 --> 24:03.239
And an asymmetric high-low top.

24:17.490 --> 24:20.256
-Or is it just going to go limp?
-Well, it'll end up going limp

24:20.292 --> 24:22.493
unless I line it.

24:22.528 --> 24:24.495
Use some infrastructure, you
could certainly use the denim

24:24.530 --> 24:27.063
-to help you with that.
-Okay.

24:27.099 --> 24:28.532
And you've already drafted
your patterns?

24:28.567 --> 24:30.133
Started draping the
pattern for my pants.

24:30.168 --> 24:32.736
I know once it's time for me to
put it together,

24:32.771 --> 24:34.137
-it's... (snaps) I sew really
quick. -All right, good.

24:34.172 --> 24:35.739
Well, then, I'm gonna
let you do that.

All right, designers.

24:43.382 --> 24:45.849
I am very excited
about what you're doing.

24:45.885 --> 24:49.653
You have done a lot of work,
and you have a lot more to do.

24:49.688 --> 24:51.154
Your models will be coming in

24:51.189 --> 24:52.623
very shortly, all right?

24:52.658 --> 24:54.224
And you know you have

24:54.259 --> 24:56.593
And we'll have our regular

24:56.629 --> 24:58.695

tomorrow morning, okay?

24:58.731 --> 25:00.998
And I will see you

25:01.033 --> 25:02.098

ERIN:
Hi.

Go with what he says,
like I did last week,

25:22.555 --> 25:23.987
and get-- be put safe.

25:24.023 --> 25:25.889
<i> I'm taking Tim's advice.</i>

25:25.925 --> 25:28.091
<i> I'm gonna make</i>
<i> the top a jacket,</i>

25:28.126 --> 25:29.459
<i> and I'm gonna make</i>
<i> the bottom a skirt.</i>

25:29.461 --> 25:29.593
<i> if'mBue, I</i>

25:30.996 --> 25:33.458
- I'm gonna be pissed.
- Make it work.

25:33.508 --> 25:35.032
Right

25:36.201 --> 25:37.167
-What's your name?
-Lais.

25:37.202 --> 25:38.368
Lais.
<i> La isla bonita.</i>

25:38.403 --> 25:40.470
Can't even believe
I get you again.

25:40.505 --> 25:41.538
-(squealing)
-I know!

25:43.676 --> 25:45.909
So, I'm gonna pinch it.

25:45.945 --> 25:48.579
Boo, you are actually
32 and a half.

25:48.614 --> 25:51.582
<i> When my model comes in,</i>
<i> I don't have anything for her</i>

25:51.617 --> 25:54.250
to put on because I haven't
sewn it together.

25:54.286 --> 25:55.485
We done.

25:55.520 --> 25:56.620
I promise you, you'll be ready.

25:56.655 --> 25:58.021
<i> The main thing is</i>

25:58.057 --> 25:59.355
to get a garment

25:59.391 --> 26:00.691
<i> on my model, all right?</i>

26:00.726 --> 26:02.492
The rest doesn't matter.

26:06.264 --> 26:08.331
Yes.

26:08.366 --> 26:10.200
-(laughs)
-That's for sure.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.469
Okay, you are so tiny, too.

26:12.537 --> 26:14.337
The dress actually ends up being
very big on her.

26:14.372 --> 26:17.774
<i> I've got to take it in</i>
<i> quite a bit.</i>

26:17.810 --> 26:19.810
All right, I got work to do.

26:19.845 --> 26:21.712
Unfortunately,
the fabric I chose,

26:21.747 --> 26:22.746
<i> the sweater material</i>

26:22.815 --> 26:23.747
<i> starts stretching,</i>

26:23.782 --> 26:24.781

26:24.817 --> 26:26.382
And stretching.

26:26.418 --> 26:28.652
Awesome.

26:28.687 --> 26:30.787
-There you go.
-Thank you.

26:30.823 --> 26:32.188
I'll press everything out.

26:32.224 --> 26:33.490
Nothing's pressed at the moment.

26:33.525 --> 26:34.725
CORNELIUS:
Bye, thank you!

26:41.667 --> 26:44.367
-I really like this color.
-So, Erin's stuff's cool.

26:44.402 --> 26:46.569

<i> making something amazing.</i>

26:46.605 --> 26:48.772

But those pants.

27:07.326 --> 27:09.826
Poor him. I like him.

27:09.862 --> 27:11.194
I'm in disbelief right now about

27:11.230 --> 27:12.363
<i> Brik's pants.</i>

27:16.101 --> 27:17.934
And now he's doing another pant?

27:17.970 --> 27:18.835
Like, come on, dude.

27:27.280 --> 27:29.012
LAURENCE:
<i> Cornelius, I'm like,</i>

27:29.047 --> 27:30.013
"What are you doing?"

27:30.048 --> 27:31.682
<i> I don't like this side of him,</i>

27:34.487 --> 27:36.887
I think I-I'm actually
starting to see people

27:36.989 --> 27:39.657
<i> just brushing it off</i>
<i> a little bit, so...</i>

27:41.360 --> 27:43.827
ALEX:
Uh-oh, royalty is in the room.

27:43.862 --> 27:46.163
Lady Cornelius
from the Land of Shade.

27:46.198 --> 27:48.865
(Cornelius chuckles)

27:48.901 --> 27:52.403
Down to the wire, five minutes.

27:52.438 --> 27:54.137
My skirt has a hole in it,
and I can't even repair it.

27:54.173 --> 27:56.307
<i> Once I get the skirt</i>
<i> constructed,</i>

27:56.342 --> 27:58.041
I put the zipper in,
and I notice

27:58.076 --> 27:59.343
<i> there's a hole.</i>

27:59.378 --> 28:02.012
I'm just hoping I don't go home.

Kimber is frantic

28:15.861 --> 28:18.462

28:53.732 --> 28:55.699
All right, let's get to work.

28:57.269 --> 28:59.203
LINDA: <i> I'm very worried.</i>
<i> Unfortunately,</i>

28:59.238 --> 29:00.637
the problems I'm having
with my garment

29:24.597 --> 29:25.895
Hi, Tim.

Good morning, designers.

But is everyone all right?

29:31.737 --> 29:33.270
(clamoring in agreement)

29:33.305 --> 29:34.271
Your models will come in soon.

29:34.340 --> 29:35.805
You will have
two hours to send them

29:38.144 --> 29:40.910

design studio, all right?

29:40.946 --> 29:43.713
This is our JustFab challenge.

-ROBERI: Morning! Mwah.
-MODEL: Good morning.

30:02.234 --> 30:03.567
-How are you?
-Great.

30:03.602 --> 30:05.769
-Almost done, look at this.
-Wow.

30:05.804 --> 30:07.837
(whistles)
Think it's perfect, yeah.

30:07.873 --> 30:09.173
I'm happy.

30:09.208 --> 30:10.774
LINDA: I think we'll have you
put on the dress.

30:10.809 --> 30:13.043
Perfect.

30:14.313 --> 30:15.779
Just want to see
where the pockets fall.

30:15.814 --> 30:18.215
Laurence's jumpsuit is the bomb.

30:18.250 --> 30:20.116
<i> I would wear it,</i>
<i> my daughters would wear it.</i>

30:20.152 --> 30:21.951
<i> It's really cool.</i>

Just like her.

We're just gonna,
we're just gonna,

30:25.057 --> 30:26.690
just gonna work it out,
you know?

30:26.725 --> 30:29.826
<i> The hole is obviously</i>
<i> so prominent.</i>

30:29.861 --> 30:31.094
<i> I know I have to cover it up.</i>

30:31.129 --> 30:32.996
<i> I do have an idea.</i>
<i> It's a black skirt.</i>

30:33.031 --> 30:35.265
I'll make it interesting by
adding a satin tuxedo stripe.

30:35.334 --> 30:38.168
I think this is, like,
my "make it work" moment.

30:38.204 --> 30:40.270
-Make It Work: The Sequel.
-(laughs)

30:44.876 --> 30:47.511
Perfect.
All right, we're good.

30:47.546 --> 30:49.779
I love that, um,
closure that you have.

30:49.815 --> 30:51.815
Is it gonna be like that
or is it gonna be open?

30:51.850 --> 30:53.149
-It's not gonna close.
-Oh, it's not?

30:53.185 --> 30:54.284
-Yeah.
-Oh, nice.

30:54.320 --> 30:55.285
ALEX:
<i> Brik's look is bland.</i>

30:55.321 --> 30:57.287
<i> And he could barely sew</i>

30:57.323 --> 30:59.256
a stretch pair
of pants together.

30:59.291 --> 31:01.958
<i> It is a complete middle finger</i>

31:08.200 --> 31:10.300
Yeah, I like her.

31:10.336 --> 31:12.836
KIMBER:
Oh, (bleep) me.

31:12.871 --> 31:14.338
What?

31:14.373 --> 31:16.773
-Oh, my God.
-What's wrong?

31:16.808 --> 31:19.209
This top is giving me hell.

31:19.245 --> 31:23.614
<i> It's been pulled and now</i>
<i> my (bleep) top is curling.</i>

31:23.649 --> 31:25.215
So, all I can do
at this point is

<i> press it out as much</i>
<i> as I possibly can</i>

31:27.018 --> 31:29.018
<i> to try to keep it</i>
<i> from curling up.</i>

31:29.054 --> 31:30.987
'Cause I'm like,
"You know what, devil,

31:31.022 --> 31:32.989
"you go back to hell,
'cause it's not gonna happen.

31:33.024 --> 31:34.858

This is amazing.
This gel lipstick,

Using just the black pencil

31:57.015 --> 31:59.182
like this... in two seconds,

31:59.217 --> 32:01.050
it starts to create

32:16.302 --> 32:17.534
-Okay. -Just some strands
of hair hanging,

32:20.472 --> 32:22.038
and I want a braid to the side.

32:22.073 --> 32:24.974

-Off her face.

33:33.812 --> 33:36.346

<i> to save my garment.</i>

33:36.382 --> 33:37.714
I'm trying everything

ERKI I feel good about it.

33:54.867 --> 33:56.165
It look good, yes.

33:56.201 --> 33:58.735
KIMBER: <i> I know the construction</i>
<i> isn't the best,</i>

33:58.771 --> 34:00.437
<i> but I know it's not the worst.</i>

34:00.472 --> 34:01.772
I really feel good about it.

34:01.807 --> 34:05.041
Designers,
you and your models and I

34:05.076 --> 34:06.910
are going down to the runway,
all right, everyone?

34:06.945 --> 34:08.745
-Okay.
-Off we go.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.782
Laurence, you ready?

34:11.817 --> 34:14.583
All right, done.

34:14.620 --> 34:16.219
HEIDI:
<i> Coming up on</i> Project Runway...

34:16.254 --> 34:18.087
She looks great.

34:18.123 --> 34:20.924
I think it's very fresh
and current to the eye.

34:20.958 --> 34:21.925
That is my kind of girl.

34:21.960 --> 34:23.960
It looks really shabby.

34:23.995 --> 34:25.896
It's like weird office wear.

34:25.964 --> 34:27.297
It-It's kind of sad.

34:29.303 --> 34:32.737
(all oohing and ahhing)

34:32.773 --> 34:33.670
Hello, everybody.

34:33.706 --> 34:34.806
ALL:
Hi.

34:34.841 --> 34:36.708
And welcome to the runway.

34:36.777 --> 34:38.877
As you know, in fashion,
one day you're in,

34:38.913 --> 34:40.279
and the next day, you're out.

34:40.313 --> 34:42.047
There are 15 of you here,
and after tonight,

34:42.081 --> 34:43.248
there will be 14.

34:43.284 --> 34:46.684
For this challenge,
JustFab asked you

34:46.753 --> 34:49.454
to create looks
that would make any woman

34:49.489 --> 34:51.255
feel like a million dollars.

34:51.292 --> 34:53.858
And you were to design
a fashionable look

34:53.893 --> 34:55.928
that would be fab for all.

34:55.963 --> 34:58.863
And the winner of today's
challenge will have their look

34:58.899 --> 35:02.034
reproduced and sold
on JustFab.com. All right.

35:02.069 --> 35:03.468
Let's say hello
to our judges.

35:03.503 --> 35:06.004
First, we have creative director
of Brooks Brothers Women

35:06.040 --> 35:08.173
and fashion designer, Zac Posen.

35:08.208 --> 35:10.875
-Hello, designers.
-(all saying hello)

35:10.911 --> 35:12.911
Creative director for <i> Marie</i>
<i> Claire</i> magazine, Nina Garcia.

35:12.947 --> 35:15.047
-Hi, everyone.
-(all saying hello)

35:15.082 --> 35:17.715
And today's guest judge,
actress Nina Dobrev,

35:17.751 --> 35:20.252
starring in the upcoming <i> </i>
<i> xXx: The Return</i>

35:20.287 --> 35:22.821
<i> of Xander Cage.</i>
Welcome.

35:22.856 --> 35:24.923
Thank you.
Hey, guys.

We have an anonymous runway
show, so we, the judges,

35:31.865 --> 35:34.866
will not know who made
which look, all right?

35:34.901 --> 35:35.968
Let's start the show.

35:36.003 --> 35:39.237
¶ ¶

35:43.177 --> 35:45.110
LAURENCE:
<i> My heart is just pounding.</i>

35:45.145 --> 35:47.279
<i> But I think she looks dope.</i>

35:47.314 --> 35:50.048
<i> She looks how I wanted her</i>
<i> to look, so I feel good.</i>

36:01.828 --> 36:03.928
RIK:
<i> I'm feeling very confident</i>

36:03.964 --> 36:07.065
<i> about the look.</i>
<i> She's working the runway.</i>

36:07.101 --> 36:09.067
<i> I feel my garment</i>
<i> definitely is something that</i>

36:09.103 --> 36:10.702
<i> a normal woman would wear.</i>

36:10.737 --> 36:13.338
I like your play
with the pattern.

36:24.118 --> 36:26.385
<i> I feel that my pants</i>
<i> are absolutely on point.</i>

36:26.420 --> 36:30.922
<i> I know that this is</i>
<i> the JustFab woman.</i>

36:30.957 --> 36:33.392
<i> I couldn't be happier.</i>

36:40.901 --> 36:43.335
JENNI:
<i> I feel great about this.</i>

36:43.370 --> 36:46.171
<i> It has just enough street funk,</i>
<i> but it also has</i>

36:46.206 --> 36:48.407
<i> enough structure</i>
<i> for someone who is kind of</i>

36:48.442 --> 36:50.342
<i> scared to try</i>
<i> something different.</i>

36:53.013 --> 36:53.945
I love that.

37:03.057 --> 37:04.923
<i> I'm loving it.</i>
<i> It's really girly.</i>

37:04.958 --> 37:06.991
<i> She could put on sneakers,</i>
<i> she could put on heels.</i>

37:07.027 --> 37:09.461
<i> Whichever one she choose to do.</i>

37:11.198 --> 37:13.065
<i> I think it really does</i>
<i> represent me</i>

37:13.100 --> 37:15.967
<i> and the everyday woman--</i>
<i> it looks amazing.</i>

37:26.080 --> 37:29.147
LINDA:
<i> She's so gorgeous.</i>

37:29.183 --> 37:31.416
<i> I'm feeling like the design</i>
<i> actually might work.</i>

37:35.289 --> 37:38.223
<i> I know it doesn't look great,</i>
<i> but I hope to slide by,</i>

37:38.258 --> 37:39.991
<i> because at least I took a risk.</i>

37:43.997 --> 37:46.364
NATHALIA:
<i> I'm hoping that the judges</i>

37:46.400 --> 37:47.466
<i> see my aesthetic.</i>

37:47.501 --> 37:49.968
<i> I think it looks clean</i>
<i> and polished.</i>

37:50.003 --> 37:53.371
<i> I love the jacket.</i>
<i> It's very androgynous.</i>

38:05.552 --> 38:07.486
SARAH:
<i> The combination of</i>

38:07.521 --> 38:10.088
<i> the two pieces and the way</i>
<i> I accessorized it,</i>

38:10.124 --> 38:12.657
<i> it really is about</i>
<i> the complete look, and that's</i>

38:12.692 --> 38:14.593
<i> what the JustFab woman wants.</i>

38:14.628 --> 38:17.529
<i> I think the look is amazing.</i>

38:25.205 --> 38:30.041
MAH-JING: <i> It is sexy, confident,</i>
<i> my styling is on point.</i>

38:30.076 --> 38:32.611
<i> The clutch adds</i>
<i> just a mite of texture,</i>

38:32.646 --> 38:35.046
<i> and it picks up on the</i>
<i> tangerine stitching,</i>

38:35.081 --> 38:37.582
<i> as well as the shoes.</i>
<i> I'm very happy.</i>

38:39.486 --> 38:40.585
I want that dress.

38:46.193 --> 38:47.192
CORNELIUS:
<i> She's very modern,</i>

38:47.227 --> 38:48.360
<i> she's very hip.</i>

38:48.395 --> 38:50.395
<i> I do have a pop of color</i>
<i> in there</i>

38:50.430 --> 38:52.564
<i> that hopefully the judges</i>
<i> will notice.</i>

38:54.635 --> 38:56.601
<i> I actually feel really good</i>
<i> about this look.</i>

39:02.643 --> 39:04.643
TASHA:
<i> I'm loving the look.</i>

39:04.678 --> 39:08.547
<i> I'm loving how I did</i>
<i> all the navies on top.</i>

39:08.582 --> 39:10.382
<i> The look is good.</i>
<i> I'm confident in what I made.</i>

39:10.417 --> 39:12.617
<i> I love it.</i>

39:13.587 --> 39:14.919
The beanie is all that.

39:25.732 --> 39:28.166
BRIK: <i> I made a look that I feel</i>
<i> a lot of women</i>

39:28.202 --> 39:30.202
<i> could incorporate</i>
<i> into their wardrobe.</i>

39:30.237 --> 39:32.070
<i> I feel good about it.</i>

39:45.051 --> 39:48.086
<i> that feels "me"</i>
<i> and "everyday girl."</i>

39:50.591 --> 39:54.426
<i> It's nice, it's clean,</i>
<i> I feel good about it.</i>

40:01.702 --> 40:06.271
ROBERI: <i> The movement of the</i>
<i> jacket against the contrast</i>

40:06.306 --> 40:08.273
<i> of the two pieces, are, for me,</i>

40:08.308 --> 40:10.242
<i> just amazing.</i>

40:10.277 --> 40:12.143
DEXTER: Looks like a handmade,
delicious print.

40:12.178 --> 40:14.812
ROBERI:
<i> It's simplicity, but</i>

40:14.848 --> 40:17.215
<i> at the same time, it's complex.</i>

40:17.251 --> 40:19.117
<i> It's absolutely wearable</i>
<i> and beautifully made.</i>

40:24.491 --> 40:26.291
ERIN: <i> I think that I have</i>
<i> the craziest look on the runway</i>

40:26.326 --> 40:27.759
<i> just because of color.</i>

40:27.794 --> 40:29.527
<i> I'm feeling very confident.</i>

40:29.563 --> 40:31.630
<i> We slayed this.</i>

40:42.242 --> 40:44.409
Tonight, we saw some looks
that we really liked.

40:44.444 --> 40:46.745
And some that we didn't as much.

40:48.448 --> 40:51.750
We have just learned which
designer created which look.

40:51.785 --> 40:54.519
If I call your name,
please step forward.

40:54.554 --> 40:56.621
Erin.

40:56.657 --> 40:58.423
Kimber.

40:58.458 --> 40:59.557
Alex.

40:59.593 --> 41:01.225
Laurence.

41:01.261 --> 41:02.627
Linda.

41:02.663 --> 41:05.297
Brik.

41:05.332 --> 41:08.767
If I have not called your name,
congratulations.

41:08.802 --> 41:10.468
Your scores have qualified you

41:10.504 --> 41:12.737
to move on to the next round.
You can leave the runway.

41:17.911 --> 41:18.777
SARAH:
I hope that Brik is in the top.

41:18.812 --> 41:19.911
CORNELIUS:
He's not in the top.

41:19.946 --> 41:21.913
That silhouette
has already been seen.

41:21.948 --> 41:23.448
-Right, but they were loving it.
-It's a pair of pants

41:23.483 --> 41:24.849
and then a blazer.

41:24.918 --> 41:27.185
The drop of the pant
is sitting right here.

41:27.220 --> 41:28.320
They're ill-fitting.

41:28.355 --> 41:29.688
Good person. Great designer?

41:29.723 --> 41:31.923
I just don't know.

41:31.958 --> 41:34.826
The six of you have the highest
and the lowest scores.

41:34.861 --> 41:36.795
One of you will be
named the winner,

41:36.830 --> 41:38.262
and one of you will be out.

41:42.185 --> 41:45.052
The six of you have the highest
and the lowest scores.

41:46.323 --> 41:48.423
One of you will be
named the winner...

41:49.460 --> 41:50.425
...and one of you will be out.

41:52.029 --> 41:53.928
Let's bring out your models.

41:58.836 --> 42:00.302
-Hi, Alex.
-Hi.

42:00.337 --> 42:01.637
Tell us about your look.

42:01.672 --> 42:03.572
My woman in my head
has always kind of been,

42:03.608 --> 42:05.874
like, this Upper East girl

42:05.910 --> 42:08.210
that's not afraid to get
on a motorcycle,

42:08.245 --> 42:10.145
and because we were looking
at all body shapes

42:10.180 --> 42:13.248
and all types of women,
I went natural waist,

42:13.283 --> 42:16.151
and it actually has a little bit
of an elastic back.

42:16.186 --> 42:18.186
I really wanted to go
with the sheer top

42:18.222 --> 42:20.522
so somebody can make it
their own,

42:20.557 --> 42:23.158
with a color underneath.

42:23.193 --> 42:26.461
I really like this look, Alex,
I gave it a high score.

42:26.497 --> 42:30.198
I think it looked, from head
to toe, really polished.

42:30.234 --> 42:32.367
I love her hair and make up,
I love the booties.

42:32.402 --> 42:34.569
I love the accessories,

42:34.605 --> 42:36.605
I love the oversized bow.

42:36.641 --> 42:38.240
I do think that,
obviously, that short

42:38.275 --> 42:41.510
crop top is, um, difficult
to wear for most women.

42:41.545 --> 42:43.879
But all pieces that you made,

42:43.914 --> 42:45.681
-I think, are great.
-Thank you.

42:45.716 --> 42:48.483
I love the drama of the bow.

42:48.519 --> 42:51.053
I think it's terrific.

42:51.088 --> 42:52.587
I love the cut.

42:52.657 --> 42:54.222
It's versatile.

42:54.258 --> 42:55.624
The pant makes me crazy.

42:55.660 --> 42:59.194
I think it's a great pant
that's very easy,

42:59.229 --> 43:00.562
that looks flattering
whether you're

43:00.597 --> 43:02.297
thin or a little curvy.

43:02.332 --> 43:04.199
She looks great.

43:04.234 --> 43:06.468
-Would you wear this, Nina?
-Yes.

43:06.503 --> 43:08.270
-Thank you.
-I do love the bow

43:08.305 --> 43:09.772
-very, very much.
-Yes, me, too.

43:09.840 --> 43:11.640
-I do love the pants
with the pockets -Yes.

43:11.676 --> 43:12.574
-very, very much.
-Yeah.

43:12.643 --> 43:13.809
I also like the sleeves.

43:13.844 --> 43:15.577
Just the way it drapes over
and falls.

43:15.612 --> 43:16.812
-It's really pretty.
-HEIDI: Mm-hmm, it's nice.

43:16.847 --> 43:19.581
Yeah, it's very, you know,
Uptown,

43:19.616 --> 43:21.449
Upper East Side fantasy.

43:21.485 --> 43:22.818
I like the mystery

43:22.853 --> 43:24.419
that you created
with textures

43:24.454 --> 43:26.689
and proportions
and volumes there.

43:26.724 --> 43:28.523
Do I think it's revolutionary?

43:28.559 --> 43:31.760
No.
I personally have seen a million

43:31.796 --> 43:34.529
taffeta or duchess satin
large bows.

43:34.565 --> 43:36.732
But it is effective.

43:36.767 --> 43:38.200
Kimber, tell us about your look.

43:38.268 --> 43:39.668
With this being, um,

43:39.704 --> 43:41.837
A-line and high-low,

43:41.872 --> 43:44.573
I thought of this being
the everyday woman.

43:44.675 --> 43:46.408
Girls and women that,

43:46.443 --> 43:49.277
either if they're slim
or if they're heavyset

43:49.313 --> 43:52.514
or whatever, a lot of times,
the midsection is always

43:52.549 --> 43:54.416
a part that a woman wants
to cinch in,

43:54.451 --> 43:57.086
so I love making
the high-waist pant.

43:57.121 --> 43:59.688
he
aIs treinrestte
lining in the pocket?

43:59.724 --> 44:02.524
Okay. That's a cute detail.

44:02.559 --> 44:03.558
I like the pants.

44:03.594 --> 44:04.860
They look well-made.

44:04.895 --> 44:07.529
I agree with you
about a high waist.

44:07.664 --> 44:09.397
The top, Ill'miny eatono

44:09.399 --> 44:10.498
.
thI atin

44:10.534 --> 44:12.735
for a woman with a larger bust.

44:12.770 --> 44:14.703
To me, it's just not singing.

44:14.739 --> 44:19.507
I think that when the coolest
thing on your outfit

44:19.543 --> 44:20.575
is the model's hair,

44:20.611 --> 44:22.778
we have a problem.

44:22.813 --> 44:24.747
In terms of fashion, it's okay.

44:24.782 --> 44:26.648
It shouldn't be okay.

44:26.683 --> 44:28.751
It needs to be fantastic.

44:28.786 --> 44:30.318
You know, as much as I agree

44:30.354 --> 44:31.854
with a lot of the things

44:31.889 --> 44:33.555
that you guys are all saying,
I do disagree

44:33.590 --> 44:34.957
on a couple of things.

44:34.992 --> 44:37.325
Yes, it is hard to wear
crop-tops in general.

44:37.361 --> 44:39.427
She was considerate enough
to put the pant higher.

44:39.463 --> 44:42.497
Also, the fact that there
was a pattern on top,

44:42.532 --> 44:46.501
it does pop a little bit more,
with the darker pant.

44:46.536 --> 44:47.936
It looks stunning.

44:47.972 --> 44:49.738
Laurence,
tell us about your look.

44:49.774 --> 44:51.673
I was thinking
about something cool

44:51.708 --> 44:53.008
that every woman can wear,

44:53.043 --> 44:54.076
and so I came up
with a jumpsuit.

44:54.111 --> 44:55.410
Not too fitted.

44:55.445 --> 44:57.312
I figured, if you have a little
booty to hide,

44:57.347 --> 44:59.447
you could hide it in it,
or a little bit of belly.

44:59.483 --> 45:01.683
And I did a little opening,

45:01.718 --> 45:02.918
like, a little color
in the back,

45:02.953 --> 45:04.519
and, uh, pockets,
and a drop crotch.

45:04.554 --> 45:07.722
Laurence, it is so easy,

45:07.758 --> 45:10.125
and I feel like that is
something that really

45:11.361 --> 45:13.862
any  uln woma.wecoar
Yes, I mean, jumpsuits are no

45:13.898 --> 45:15.764
new invention,
but at the same time,

45:15.800 --> 45:17.499
you did bring a lot

45:17.601 --> 45:20.302
of new little design elements
to your jumpsuit.

45:20.337 --> 45:21.970
You know, I love having
the little color

45:22.006 --> 45:23.772
in the back.
I love the pockets.

45:23.808 --> 45:25.740
I love how you styled it
with the pumps.

45:25.776 --> 45:27.509
That is my kind of girl.

45:27.544 --> 45:29.577
And I think my mom,
even though she's 73,

45:29.613 --> 45:31.379
she would rock that, too.

45:31.448 --> 45:33.048
Thank you.

45:33.083 --> 45:35.650
I think her attitude
is super cool.

45:35.686 --> 45:38.586
Can you turn around?

45:38.622 --> 45:39.988
I love the drop waist.

45:40.024 --> 45:42.858
I love the placement
of the pockets.

45:42.893 --> 45:45.060
Would women of all ages wear it?

45:45.095 --> 45:46.094
I don't know.

45:46.096 --> 45:46.328
He
moid vm i's ecy is

45:48.265 --> 45:49.764
iasp
-She would.
-(Zac chuckles)

45:49.800 --> 45:53.836
I don't know if any other
73-year-old would wear it.

45:53.871 --> 45:56.371
ZAC: You know, I think
there's great detail here.

45:56.406 --> 45:57.906
I think you had some really
interesting proportion play.

45:57.942 --> 46:01.076
You took something
very utilitarian,

46:01.111 --> 46:02.544
you know,
and played with themes.

46:02.579 --> 46:03.611
I I think it's very fresh

46:03.647 --> 46:05.513
and current to the eye.

46:05.549 --> 46:07.482
It looks polished and sharp.

46:07.517 --> 46:09.117
Even the detail of the bottom,
the ruching at the ankle,

46:09.153 --> 46:11.419
it just gives it
that little bit of edge.

46:11.455 --> 46:12.988
-Thank you. -DOBREV:
Even the zipper, the way it goes

46:13.023 --> 46:14.890
all the way down,
and the detail of the button

46:14.925 --> 46:16.591
and the collar, it just like...

46:16.626 --> 46:17.860
-And the pockets.. -ZAC: I have
a little contention, though,

46:17.895 --> 46:19.394
with the zipper, I have to say.

46:19.429 --> 46:22.297
Like, an older customer
is gonna think

46:22.333 --> 46:24.532
it's a little dingle dangle
right on your crotch.

46:24.568 --> 46:27.135
You can put it inside
if you want.

46:27.171 --> 46:29.338
HEIDI:
Linda, tell us about your look.

46:29.373 --> 46:31.139
I was thinking
about the urban woman.

46:31.175 --> 46:33.575
The woman who may
have had children,

46:33.610 --> 46:38.713
and wants to make sure she shows
the best parts of her body.

46:38.749 --> 46:39.882
I have three kids.

46:39.917 --> 46:41.716
I know my body's changed
quite a bit.

46:41.752 --> 46:43.418
I was going for an urban kimono,

46:43.453 --> 46:46.721
uh, look, and so,
on the underneath,

46:46.757 --> 46:48.723
I chose a gray knit,

46:48.759 --> 46:50.893
which I thought
was really beautiful,

46:50.928 --> 46:52.460
and I put a little peekaboo

46:52.496 --> 46:56.331
in the top
just to give some relief.

46:56.367 --> 46:57.465
Ms. Garcia, what do you think?

46:57.501 --> 47:00.302
Um, hmm.

47:00.337 --> 47:03.772
I do have a problem
with your color palette.

47:03.807 --> 47:05.673
I also have a problem

47:05.709 --> 47:08.944
with your fabric
for the kimono,

47:08.979 --> 47:11.679
because it looks really shabby.

47:11.715 --> 47:13.715
I think a knit dress

47:13.750 --> 47:17.886
is a very hard item to wear.

47:17.922 --> 47:19.754
No matter what your figure is.

47:19.790 --> 47:21.656
I agree with you.
Knit is so hard.

47:21.691 --> 47:23.558
-Knit is so hard!
-I would not wear knit, either.

47:23.593 --> 47:25.593
Really... I really...
I disagree.

47:25.629 --> 47:28.496
The knit gives some curves that
I think look really beautiful.

47:28.532 --> 47:30.465
Can she turn around
and take off the kimono?

47:30.500 --> 47:32.000
HEIDI:
<i> Exactamundo.</i>

47:32.036 --> 47:34.202
-It's already droopy butt.
-NINA: It is all...

47:34.238 --> 47:35.870
This is a model.

47:35.906 --> 47:37.272
And she's got a problem.

47:37.308 --> 47:38.807
HEIDI:
It grows.

47:38.842 --> 47:40.775
Who is this girl?
Where is she wearing this to?

47:40.811 --> 47:42.811
-To the office?
-LINDA: Where is she wearing it?

47:42.846 --> 47:45.013
Yeah. I mean, going to the
office, and then picking up

47:45.049 --> 47:46.614
-her kids afterwards and going
out to dinner... -Really?

47:46.650 --> 47:48.483
-...with her husband, sure.
-HEIDI: No one is going

47:48.518 --> 47:50.185
to lunch in this and picking up
her kids at school.

47:50.254 --> 47:51.954
You know, I...
I was going for it.

47:51.989 --> 47:55.657
Sometimes things don't work;
you got to try those things.

47:55.692 --> 47:57.892
Would you please put the jacket
back on?

47:57.928 --> 47:59.694
Or not.

47:59.729 --> 48:00.728
Hide the jacket.

48:00.764 --> 48:02.497
Burn the jacket.

48:02.532 --> 48:03.999
It-It's kind of sad.

48:04.034 --> 48:07.502
Linda, I have to say this really
was a missed opportunity.

48:07.537 --> 48:09.704
-Especially this challenge.
-ZAC: Yeah, this should

48:09.739 --> 48:11.773
-have been your challenge.
-I-- believe me, I know.

48:11.808 --> 48:13.575
ZAC:
I-- okay.

48:13.610 --> 48:16.445
Brik, tell us about your look.

48:16.480 --> 48:18.913
The first thing that I thought
about was the girl.

48:18.949 --> 48:22.851
And I thought o-of one
of my friends back home.

48:22.886 --> 48:24.419
She works nine-to-five,

48:24.455 --> 48:27.789
and she has a really good,
funky,

48:27.824 --> 48:29.624
eclectic aesthetic.

48:29.659 --> 48:33.028
And it's always hard for her
to find a blazer to wear.

48:33.063 --> 48:36.465
So I thought, "Huh, what if
I made just a really sharp,

48:36.500 --> 48:40.268
"like, fit and flare jacket
with flattering lines that

48:40.304 --> 48:42.704
"would work on a variety
of body types,

48:42.739 --> 48:44.839
"and a pull-on pant that is like
a chic knit,

48:44.875 --> 48:48.276
a  c grd t.praphi

48:48.312 --> 48:51.380
Well, last episode, you had

48:51.415 --> 48:53.315
many personalities
in one design.

48:53.350 --> 48:56.751
This time
you have no personality.

48:56.786 --> 49:00.688
And the number one thing
less flattering

49:00.724 --> 49:03.625
than a knit dress is knit pants.

49:03.660 --> 49:05.727
I thought these were cute.

49:05.762 --> 49:08.596
-I would wear those.
-It's just ha-hard to wear.

49:08.632 --> 49:09.797
ZAC:
Can I see the back?

49:13.303 --> 49:14.702
I have so little to say.

49:14.738 --> 49:17.439
(sputters)
God.

49:17.474 --> 49:18.740
ZAC:
I don't know.

49:18.775 --> 49:21.076
I feel like there's some...

49:21.145 --> 49:23.745
conception issues
of the whole outfit

49:23.780 --> 49:25.980
that are happening here

49:26.016 --> 49:27.449
and in the last challenge.

49:27.484 --> 49:29.051
DOBREV:
The first thing that popped

49:29.086 --> 49:31.086
into my head was, "Mullet?"

49:31.121 --> 49:32.487
Business in the front,
party in the back.

49:32.523 --> 49:34.722
And it feels like it's business
in the top,

49:34.758 --> 49:37.526
and then couch party
on the bottom.

49:37.561 --> 49:38.760
Yeah, she cannot make up her
mind whether to go to work

49:38.795 --> 49:40.028
or be a couch potato.

49:40.064 --> 49:41.596
-(laughing)
-HEIDI: Who is this girl?

49:41.631 --> 49:43.398
Is she... it's like...

49:43.434 --> 49:45.600
Is she working in the office?

49:45.635 --> 49:47.635
-It's like weird office wear.
-NINA: It's just no personality.

49:47.671 --> 49:49.037
-Right? It's like weird
office wear. -No personality.

49:49.073 --> 49:51.839
It's like,
wh-who is this bland person?

49:51.875 --> 49:53.975
HEIDI:
Right.

49:54.010 --> 49:56.178
Erin, please tell us
about your look.

49:56.213 --> 49:57.812
It was really amazing to see
these hundreds of women.

49:57.847 --> 50:01.483
I really took off on, when Tim
said, "Versatility."

50:01.518 --> 50:03.552
And I was thinking about
different body shapes.

50:03.587 --> 50:04.852
So, I kind of thought it'd
be cool if there was,

50:04.888 --> 50:07.189
like, an outfit
that could change.

50:07.224 --> 50:10.992
So, what I did is,
I made these flaps adjustable.

50:11.027 --> 50:12.094
-So you can...
-Oh, wow.

50:12.129 --> 50:13.528
Yeah. You can cinch it...

50:13.564 --> 50:15.130
-ZAC: Very smart.
-Wow. Yeah.

50:15.165 --> 50:16.198
Yeah, you can cinch it
at the waist.

50:16.233 --> 50:18.032
-Charming.
-ZAC: Very. Really well done.

50:18.068 --> 50:21.536
I mean, I love the
transformative quality of it.

50:21.572 --> 50:24.372
I think it's effective,
in the neoprene.

50:24.408 --> 50:28.643
Not the easiest fabric to wear,
for all body types.

50:28.678 --> 50:30.845
But I think, you know,
it feels very high fashion.

50:30.880 --> 50:32.847
And I think you've made
something very wearable.

50:32.916 --> 50:34.983
Can she turn?
I want to see how it looks

50:35.018 --> 50:36.851
with the belt closed
from the back.

50:36.886 --> 50:38.853
-It's very... -ZAC: Oh,
I think it's excellent.

50:38.888 --> 50:39.988
-NINA: Yes. Even...
-ZAC: Excellent. Even better.

50:40.023 --> 50:41.256
Even better.

50:41.291 --> 50:43.125
For me, this look
really stood out

50:43.160 --> 50:44.826
when I saw it,
and right--

50:44.861 --> 50:48.863
seeing it right here,
in this sea of black and gray...

50:48.898 --> 50:50.832
and you brought us color.

50:50.867 --> 50:53.135
-And I think that's a fun dress.
-ZAC: Yeah.

50:53.170 --> 50:55.137
And if I were shopping online,

50:55.172 --> 50:58.173
that look would go on my cart.

50:58.208 --> 51:00.908
-Immediately. -(softly): Yes.
That's my goal. (chuckles)

51:00.944 --> 51:02.644
A lot of-- a lot of women...

51:02.712 --> 51:04.212
it's always better to, sort of,
cinch at the waist, and then...

51:04.248 --> 51:05.813
Yeah, just depending
on the body type.

51:05.849 --> 51:07.949
Every-- yeah. But this one's
definitely flattering for most.

51:07.984 --> 51:09.584
I would wear that.

51:09.653 --> 51:11.953
Well, this is our
second runway show.

51:11.988 --> 51:15.923
And I feel like I know now
who you are as a designer.

51:15.959 --> 51:17.725
And to be honest,
it's always

51:17.761 --> 51:19.494
the one that
stands out the most.

51:19.530 --> 51:21.796
I do like this look a lot, too.

51:21.831 --> 51:25.267
And I do believe that it will
stand out on the Web site.

51:25.302 --> 51:28.703
Now, it could go a little too
high fashion,

51:28.738 --> 51:31.306
it could be a little bit too
cartoonish, in a way.

51:31.341 --> 51:32.440
-ZAC: Well, I think...
-NINA: I don't... I don't agree

51:32.476 --> 51:33.808
that it's cartoonish.

51:33.843 --> 51:35.877
I think it's actually
very charming.

51:35.912 --> 51:38.980
I'm just saying, I love it.
I do-- I love it.

51:39.015 --> 51:39.981
Would I buy it? No.

51:40.016 --> 51:41.949
It is a difficult sleeve
to wear.

51:41.985 --> 51:45.187
If it didn't have any sleeves,
it would be an easier sell.

51:45.222 --> 51:46.421
-For you, but not for
the customer. -But... yes.

51:46.456 --> 51:48.022
Not for the customer.
Not everybody...

51:48.058 --> 51:49.624
HEIDI: I don't know about that.
I think it would sell more

51:49.660 --> 51:50.625
without sleeves.

51:50.661 --> 51:52.160
-Thank you, Erin. -Thanks.

51:52.196 --> 51:54.563
Okay, we've heard
what you had to say.

51:54.598 --> 51:56.565
We're gonna bring out
your models,

51:56.600 --> 51:57.632
have a little chat,

51:57.668 --> 51:59.634
and then I call you back
onto the runway.

51:59.670 --> 52:02.370
Now you can leave the runway.
Thank you.

52:07.644 --> 52:08.543
Hi.

52:08.579 --> 52:10.679
ALL: Hello.

52:10.714 --> 52:12.414
Hey. What's going on, y'all?

52:12.482 --> 52:13.815
NATHALIA:
Who were the tops, bottom?

52:13.850 --> 52:15.883
I'm top.

52:15.919 --> 52:16.984
And who else is top?

52:17.020 --> 52:19.487
-Oh, wow. Three's on top!
-(all clamoring)

52:19.523 --> 52:21.956
I was shocked when Nina said
that she would wear it.

52:21.991 --> 52:23.725
DEXTER:
Big sis is top?

52:23.760 --> 52:25.860
-Big sis is top.
-Yes. -That's awesome.

52:25.895 --> 52:28.330
-I'm the bottom. -KIMBER:
Heidi said she didn't like it.

52:28.365 --> 52:31.666
They didn't feel
like my top was fit

52:31.702 --> 52:33.134
for certain ages.

52:33.169 --> 52:34.836
BRIK:
Well, I'm in the bottom.

52:34.871 --> 52:36.971
Zac said he, like, didn't even
have anything to say...

52:37.006 --> 52:39.107
-about it. No,
-(gasps)

52:39.142 --> 52:40.242
I kind of just like, giggled,

52:40.277 --> 52:41.710
because I'm so delirious
right now.

52:41.745 --> 52:42.977
-Right.
-Basically, they were bored,

52:43.012 --> 52:44.546
and they thought
it didn't make sense.

52:44.581 --> 52:46.548
ALEX: <i> Brik needs</i>
<i> to go back to school.</i>

52:46.583 --> 52:49.817
Basics would be
an understatement.

52:49.853 --> 52:51.185
NATHALIA:
What did they say about you?

52:51.221 --> 52:53.688
Hated all of it.

52:53.724 --> 52:57.225
(sighs) Of course,
I'm disappointed in myself.

52:57.261 --> 53:00.828
<i> You know, sometimes</i>
<i> you just don't hit the mark.</i>

53:00.864 --> 53:02.697
I blew it.

53:04.936 --> 53:07.337
<i> The winner of</i> Project

53:37.399 --> 53:38.185
Hi, Tim!

53:38.235 --> 53:40.168
-Hi, Heidi.
-Hello.

53:40.203 --> 53:41.370
-Hello, Zac. Hello, Nina.
-Hi, Tim.

53:41.405 --> 53:44.172
-And Nina!
-Hello, ladies.

53:44.207 --> 53:46.842
TIM:
So, Sherica, wearing Erin.

53:46.877 --> 53:48.710
-HEIDI: Wow.
-Really cool.

53:48.746 --> 53:51.480
HEIDI: I mean, it does look
great close-up.

53:51.515 --> 53:53.982
I wish she would've done this
on the runway. I really do.

53:54.017 --> 53:55.116
That was a great surprise.

53:55.151 --> 53:56.885
Well, what I thought
was really cool,

53:56.920 --> 53:57.786
when she did belt it,

53:57.821 --> 53:59.254
is I thought
there was a really

53:59.289 --> 54:02.090
fun play, and something
inventive with silhouette.

54:02.125 --> 54:04.860
-It's adorable. -When she walked
on the runway, it popped.

54:04.895 --> 54:06.428
It was bold.
I love that about it.

54:06.463 --> 54:07.929
Listen, it's really exciting,

54:07.964 --> 54:08.930
'cause I feel like there's

54:08.965 --> 54:10.164
a very clear design voice

54:10.200 --> 54:11.767
-that we're seeing. And that's,
-Yeah.

54:11.802 --> 54:13.067
after two challenges. And

54:13.136 --> 54:14.369
-that's exciting.
-I think it's exciting. -Yes.

54:17.808 --> 54:18.707
We have Tirzah,

54:18.742 --> 54:21.342
-wearing Laurence.
-I love this.

54:21.378 --> 54:22.277
-Yeah. This is cool.
-Love. I...

54:22.312 --> 54:23.879
I want it. Can I...

54:23.914 --> 54:25.179
take it off your body,
right now? You want to switch?

54:25.215 --> 54:26.214
-(laughs)
-Look...

54:26.249 --> 54:27.282
I love this.

54:27.317 --> 54:28.450
Also, look how slick

54:28.485 --> 54:30.852
and well made this is.
Really nice.

54:30.888 --> 54:32.320
-She's very talented.
-ZAC: Very talented.

54:32.355 --> 54:33.054
-Very talented.
-ZAC: Very.

-Yeah. -Yep.

54:39.396 --> 54:40.562
ZAC:
Ribbings, suede.

54:40.597 --> 54:42.431
This was the only thing
that she tacked,

54:42.466 --> 54:45.066
-but everything else is...
-Perfect.

54:45.101 --> 54:46.334
...so perfect.

54:46.369 --> 54:47.602
Yeah. This is a "wow."

54:50.273 --> 54:52.407
And we have Britt, wearing Alex.

54:52.443 --> 54:53.875
HEIDI:
I love that. I mean,

54:53.911 --> 54:54.976
this boy can sew.

54:55.011 --> 54:57.211
NINA: Wouldn't it have been
so much nicer

54:57.247 --> 55:00.214
to put a little sparkle
somewhere?

55:00.250 --> 55:01.349
-TIM: Yes.
-ZAC: Yeah.

55:01.384 --> 55:03.084
You know, like in a bodysuit

55:03.119 --> 55:04.953
or something that would,
kind of, catch...

55:04.988 --> 55:06.187
He just didn't have it.

55:06.222 --> 55:07.689
-Right. -Oh, yeah.
-I like this.

55:07.724 --> 55:08.957
-The...
-The darts?

55:08.992 --> 55:10.759
-Yeah, is that...?
-The pockets... the dart?

55:10.794 --> 55:11.860
-Yeah.
-ZAC: It gives it dimension.

55:14.331 --> 55:15.664
do-Ie est etpo hav
But you were saying earlier,

55:15.699 --> 55:16.865
everyone has this blouse
with this bow already.

55:16.900 --> 55:17.866
ZAC:
I mean, it's a blouse,

55:17.901 --> 55:19.501
-there's a...
-I don't. And I want it.

55:19.536 --> 55:20.902
But it's, you know,
it's kind of...

55:20.938 --> 55:22.537
That's good, it's-- works,
it's effective.

55:22.573 --> 55:24.439
-It is good.
-It's beautiful, actually.

55:26.944 --> 55:29.945
Paola is wearing Kimber.
Paola, come on out.

55:29.980 --> 55:31.446
-Yeah.
-Mm.

55:31.482 --> 55:33.214
-I don't like that.
-I mean,

55:33.249 --> 55:34.850
-the hemline is...
-It doesn't look so well made.

55:34.885 --> 55:36.284
What happened with that hem?

55:36.319 --> 55:38.319
-Why is it so curly and wavy,
and... -ZAC: It's warped.

55:38.388 --> 55:40.254
And what...
what size are you, on top?

55:40.290 --> 55:42.724
-Eight. -So, imagine, a B or C,
-That's what I said.

55:42.726 --> 55:44.459
-Id, s

-Eight-then, like a tent. or C,
-it's gonna be hard.

55:48.365 --> 55:51.265
-And we have Meandra,
wearing Linda. -To me,

55:51.301 --> 55:52.534
this is the worst.

55:52.569 --> 55:53.902
-Yeah.
-Yeah, it's pretty, uh...

55:53.937 --> 55:54.936
-high up there.
-This is the absolute worst.

55:54.972 --> 55:56.337
I have a question.
Was thi-- is this

55:56.373 --> 55:58.106
-on purpose? -Shredded?
-ZAC: Actually, I think it is.

55:58.141 --> 55:59.474
-Yes. Yes, it is.
-Oh. -I mean,

55:59.510 --> 56:00.475
-it is god-awful.
-Yeah,

56:00.511 --> 56:01.943
she sewed the seam to the
outside...

56:01.979 --> 56:03.344
-Touch this.
-She worked with it as a...

56:03.380 --> 56:06.280
-Who wants to wear that?
-I know. Ooh.

56:06.316 --> 56:07.649
Well, she was trying
to add a...

56:07.684 --> 56:09.551
-a modernity to it, and
something... -TIM: She thought.

56:09.586 --> 56:11.520
She thought,
but it's really unfortunate.

56:11.555 --> 56:13.187
This is-- this is bad costume.

56:13.223 --> 56:16.090
-Strange choices of fabric.
-Yeah. Why would you

56:16.126 --> 56:17.425
-pick this knit?
-Fabric...

56:17.460 --> 56:18.627
And this color.

56:18.662 --> 56:20.795
That was not a good choice
of fabric.

56:20.831 --> 56:21.796
-Not the right choice of fabric.
-Not the smartest move.

56:24.234 --> 56:27.035
We have Keke, wearing Brik.

56:27.070 --> 56:28.403
I don't know. I like,

56:28.438 --> 56:30.338
maybe, from here up, on its own,

56:30.373 --> 56:33.341
and then, I didn't realize this
was the material, but...

56:33.376 --> 56:34.776
-What is the material?
-It's...

56:34.811 --> 56:36.177
It's a jersey.
A jacquard jersey.

56:36.212 --> 56:39.014
-It's just very lackluster.
-I mean,

56:39.049 --> 56:41.182
e
hionthng t sou I w is,
at least

56:41.217 --> 56:43.251
these two pieces look well made.

56:43.286 --> 56:44.352
But, I have to say,

56:44.387 --> 56:48.122
Heidi, this is the second time
we see him.

56:48.158 --> 56:50.158
-No, I know, but when I look
at this, -And there is no...

56:50.226 --> 56:51.793
next to this,
to me, this is worse.

56:51.795 --> 56:54.629
gr
hiee as s . -Ttesoha
lulyno pernality.

56:54.665 --> 56:57.899
This one, at least, I can sort
of see her personality.

56:57.935 --> 56:59.067
There was risk here, at least.

56:59.102 --> 57:00.301
There-- this is, like,

57:00.336 --> 57:02.170
uh... Nowhere's Land.

57:02.205 --> 57:04.940
Which one, today,
is worse to you?

57:04.975 --> 57:07.442
I think they're equally bad.

57:09.846 --> 57:11.046
TIM:
Thank you, judges.

57:11.081 --> 57:12.180
HEIDI AND ZAC:
Thank you, Tim!

57:12.215 --> 57:14.248
So, is it between Laurence

57:14.284 --> 57:16.484
and Erin?

57:16.519 --> 57:17.586
-Laurence.
-Laurence and Erin.

57:17.621 --> 57:19.487
-And Erin.
-I love Laurence's look.

57:19.522 --> 57:22.190
I mean, hers looks
like a designer jumpsuit.

57:22.225 --> 57:24.192
This made me sing.

57:24.227 --> 57:27.062
I thought it was very special.
I would totally wear it.

57:27.097 --> 57:29.798
She got the versatility, she got
the different body shapes

57:29.833 --> 57:32.100
and ages.
It just looks so cool.

57:32.135 --> 57:33.401
But I think Erin

57:33.436 --> 57:35.503
was the only person that we saw,

57:35.538 --> 57:37.338
that was a transformable piece.

57:37.373 --> 57:41.509
She was a standout color.
Uh, with...

57:41.511 --> 57:43.211

57:43.246 --> 57:44.145
ay
S-On the runway, right.r.
-ZAC: Yeah.

57:44.180 --> 57:45.446
So, let's talk about

57:45.482 --> 57:46.948
the two worst, Brik

57:46.984 --> 57:50.184
and Linda.
To me, Linda is the worst.

57:50.220 --> 57:51.686
Honestly, I really just

57:51.755 --> 57:53.521
don't even think there's much
to talk about

57:53.556 --> 57:54.589
within these two looks.

57:54.625 --> 57:57.025
It just-- this cover,
on-on Linda's.

57:57.060 --> 57:58.559
I'm-I'm not sure what to think
about the cover.

57:58.595 --> 57:59.861
-Burn it.
-Linda's looks

57:59.896 --> 58:02.563
like someone just made it
in an hour.

58:02.599 --> 58:06.200
At least Brik's, sad as it is,
at least it looks well-made.

58:06.236 --> 58:08.169
I don't know.
It's a armhole and a dart.

58:08.204 --> 58:10.204
Brik designed
another Sybil outfit.

58:10.240 --> 58:12.206
Okay.

58:12.242 --> 58:13.642
So, we've made our decision?

58:16.279 --> 58:17.779
Let's bring them back out.

58:24.287 --> 58:27.856
The six of you have the highest
and the lowest scores.

58:27.891 --> 58:31.392
One of you will be
named the winner.

58:31.427 --> 58:32.927
And one of you will be out.

58:38.067 --> 58:42.704
Designers, some of you did
an excellent job today.

58:42.739 --> 58:46.073
And as you know, only one of you
will be the winner

58:46.109 --> 58:47.909
of the JustFab challenge.

58:47.944 --> 58:51.613
And to deliver the fabulous
news, please welcome back

58:51.682 --> 58:53.047
Traci Inglis.

58:53.082 --> 58:53.948
TRACI:
Hi, everyone.

58:53.983 --> 58:55.149
ALL:
Hi, Traci.

58:55.185 --> 58:56.651
We are thrilled that you

58:56.687 --> 58:58.886
took this challenge and really
created looks that are

58:58.922 --> 59:00.221
fab for all.

59:00.256 --> 59:01.823
So, it's my pleasure to announce

59:01.858 --> 59:04.526
that the winner
of today's challenge...

59:07.947 --> 59:09.147
...is Laurence.

59:09.182 --> 59:10.382

-Thank you.

59:14.488 --> 59:17.188

59:21.161 --> 59:22.827
I feel fabulous.

59:22.862 --> 59:23.961
I feel JustFab.

59:23.997 --> 59:25.049
(all laugh)

59:25.099 --> 59:26.198
Thank you so much.

59:26.233 --> 59:27.766
<i> I'm lost for words.</i>

59:27.801 --> 59:29.634
-It feels surreal.
-HEIDI: <i> Congratulations,</i>

59:29.669 --> 59:31.603
Laurence, your look was the most

59:31.638 --> 59:34.006
fab of them all.
And as you know,

59:34.041 --> 59:35.573
you will have immunity
for the next challenge

59:35.609 --> 59:36.775
and cannot be eliminated.

59:36.810 --> 59:38.410
You can leave the runway.

59:38.445 --> 59:39.611
Thank you.
Thanks.

59:39.646 --> 59:41.613
<i> Seriously, I'm...</i>

59:41.648 --> 59:43.215
I'm super happy and I know
you can see it on the outside,

59:43.250 --> 59:45.717
<i> but, um, it's just</i>
<i> a confirmation</i>

59:45.752 --> 59:47.185
<i> that I made the right move</i>

59:47.221 --> 59:49.087
coming into this competition.

59:49.123 --> 59:49.788
Are you the winner?

59:49.823 --> 59:51.723
Well.

59:51.758 --> 59:53.392
-(contestants clamoring)
-Yes!

59:53.427 --> 59:55.394
(cheering)

59:55.429 --> 59:57.296
-Get over here!
-Congratulations!

59:57.331 --> 59:59.531
-You did it!
-Thank you. I just...

59:59.566 --> 01:00:00.698
I just need a minute
to take it in.

01:00:00.734 --> 01:00:02.567
-Yes!
-Yeah.

01:00:05.406 --> 01:00:07.205
Erin...

01:00:07.241 --> 01:00:08.506
Alex....
You're both in.

01:00:08.542 --> 01:00:09.741
Congratulations.

01:00:09.776 --> 01:00:10.909
Leave the runway.

01:00:19.420 --> 01:00:22.787
Kimber...

01:00:22.823 --> 01:00:24.389
You're in.

01:00:24.425 --> 01:00:26.491
-Leave the runway.
-Thank you.

01:00:30.130 --> 01:00:31.763
Linda...

01:00:31.798 --> 01:00:33.265
Brik...

01:00:33.300 --> 01:00:35.334
One of you will be out.

01:00:39.673 --> 01:00:40.939
Brik.

<i> I came to</i> Project Runway

01:01:52.679 --> 01:01:56.515
because I really believe
that my second career

<i> is a fashion designer.</i>
<i> And I still believe that.</i>

01:01:58.718 --> 01:02:00.285
<i> I mean, I--</i>

01:02:00.320 --> 01:02:02.454
I'm really disappointed
that I'm going home.

01:02:02.489 --> 01:02:05.657

this experience for anything.
