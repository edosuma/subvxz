<i>The Invisible Guest</i>

02:51.500 --> 02:53.600
Mr. Doria?
Virginia Goodman.

02:53.959 --> 02:56.759
I came on behalf of your
lawyer, Felix Leiva.

02:58.282 --> 02:59.482
Nice to meet you.

03:00.750 --> 03:02.550
- Please come in.
- Thank you.

03:05.380 --> 03:08.130
- Two minutes and I'll finish dressing.
- Sure.

03:09.699 --> 03:13.413
<i>Information provided
by members of armed groups</i>

03:13.663 --> 03:18.148
<i>who withdrew and who contribute to
the search for the disappeared.</i>

03:19.000 --> 03:21.900
<i>Here, the news of the
day and this morning</i>

03:22.000 --> 03:24.483
<i>they held the
funeral of Laura Vidal,</i>

03:24.583 --> 03:27.108
<i>known photographer
and visual artist,</i>

03:27.208 --> 03:30.308
<i>allegedly killed by her
lover Adrian Doria,</i>

03:30.416 --> 03:33.067
<i>who was recently awarded the
prestigious European awards</i>

03:33.167 --> 03:35.651
<i>for Innovation and
Business Development,</i>

03:35.751 --> 03:37.330
<i>as entrepreneur of the year'.</i>

03:37.430 --> 03:40.203
<i>Doria, who had recently
launched in the Asian market,</i>

03:40.303 --> 03:42.483
<i>his company 'Go Global Tech Media',</i>

03:42.583 --> 03:46.433
<i>pleads innocence and claims to
be the victim of a conspiracy.</i>

03:47.458 --> 03:49.317
I expected you later, Ms. Goodman.

03:49.417 --> 03:51.795
Yes, I'm afraid there's been
a mishap.

03:51.895 --> 03:54.298
I tried to talk to Felix,
but he's not responding.

03:54.398 --> 03:55.598
He's traveling.

03:56.077 --> 03:59.736
But he assured me he had everything
under control, he had a lead...

03:59.836 --> 04:01.527
- that would change everything.
- Yes.

04:01.627 --> 04:03.733
This he told me the last
time I talked to him.

04:03.833 --> 04:05.989
But then I didn't know
what I know now

04:06.089 --> 04:08.116
- and that he doesn't know yet.
- Meaning?

04:08.216 --> 04:10.908
It's quite possible that you'll
be compelled to testify tonight.

04:11.008 --> 04:12.768
- What are you saying?
- My contacts in court

04:12.831 --> 04:15.544
assure me that the prosecution
has a brand new witness,

04:15.644 --> 04:18.153
that could provide a definitive
turning point in your case.

04:18.253 --> 04:21.692
No word yet on who he is, but they
are transferring him to the courts,

04:21.791 --> 04:23.942
to give a deposition within
the next three hours.

04:24.345 --> 04:25.753
I told the truth.

04:25.853 --> 04:28.365
There are gaps in your statement, Mr.
Doria

04:28.465 --> 04:30.065
and I need details.

04:31.335 --> 04:33.785
The reliability of your testimony
is based on the details.

04:34.015 --> 04:37.400
With them, I can convince the
world that you're innocent.

04:37.500 --> 04:39.650
And I assure you that I can.

04:39.875 --> 04:43.275
So far, I have never lost
a case, in any process.

04:44.333 --> 04:46.233
But I need you to cooperate.

04:46.877 --> 04:50.677
The police has turned this place in a cell.
They watch me 24 hours a day.

04:51.396 --> 04:54.317
Don't you think that if I had more to say,
I would have told you already?

04:54.417 --> 04:57.748
They will request your immediate
incarceration, Mr. Doria.

04:57.848 --> 05:00.567
We have 180 minutes to review
everything from the beginning.

05:00.667 --> 05:04.267
So I would stop complaining
and get down to business.

05:14.448 --> 05:15.198
Good.

05:15.459 --> 05:17.109
First things first.

05:17.504 --> 05:20.304
What were you and the victim
doing in that hotel?

05:30.040 --> 05:32.190
<i>They arranged for a meeting there.</i>

05:34.504 --> 05:37.254
<i>Laura and I had been seeing
each other for a few months.</i>

05:38.167 --> 05:40.417
<i>Someone who found out was
blackmailing us.</i>

05:41.367 --> 05:43.267
<i>We followed his instructions.</i>

05:44.750 --> 05:46.150
He asked for 100,000 euros.

05:46.250 --> 05:49.300
It's better to pay for the silence
of someone facing a millionaire divorce.

05:49.400 --> 05:52.000
No, I never wanted to divorce Sonia.
I love her.

05:52.125 --> 05:55.567
Why that hotel, three hundred
kilometers from your lives?

05:55.723 --> 05:56.723
I don't know.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.781
Weren't you suspicious that the appointment
was arranged in such an isolated place?

05:59.806 --> 06:03.184
- What does it matter whether it's one hotel or another?
- Had you and your lover been there before?

06:03.209 --> 06:07.059
The problem is that I have been
accused of murder, Mrs. Goodman.

06:07.187 --> 06:09.437
Everything's important, Mr. Doria.

06:10.841 --> 06:12.041
Anyway, it's all right.

06:13.184 --> 06:16.834
First, let's talk about the message
you received on your cell phone.

06:19.793 --> 06:22.943
<i>We had been waiting for a couple
of hours when it arrived.</i>

06:41.712 --> 06:42.662
What's up?

06:48.212 --> 06:49.712
He has your mobile.

06:50.167 --> 06:53.317
He just sent a message
from your cell.

06:53.583 --> 06:56.233
<i>I'll tell you everything. Room 715.
Hotel Bellavista.</i>

06:57.000 --> 06:58.300
It's a trap.

06:59.177 --> 07:00.377
We're leaving.

07:27.335 --> 07:28.185
Adrian?

07:32.196 --> 07:34.696
I was unconscious for a few minutes...

07:35.773 --> 07:38.778
<i>and when I woke up, the nightmare
started.</i>

07:43.097 --> 07:44.947
<i>What's the first thing
you remember?</i>

07:45.667 --> 07:47.117
<i>The knocks on the door.</i>

07:48.698 --> 07:49.598
Police!

07:51.950 --> 07:53.000
Are you OK?

08:18.048 --> 08:18.948
Police!

08:20.199 --> 08:21.399
Open the door.

08:31.634 --> 08:32.784
Move away.

08:33.924 --> 08:34.974
Laura! Hey!

08:40.004 --> 08:42.453
- Can you hear me? Laura?
- Open, please!

08:43.092 --> 08:45.792
- Laura!
- Anyone there, open the door!

08:45.892 --> 08:47.431
No... no!

08:48.990 --> 08:50.361
Laura! Help!

08:51.403 --> 08:52.820
Help please!

08:53.007 --> 08:53.907
Police!

08:55.278 --> 08:56.241
Help!

08:58.416 --> 08:59.316
Stand up!

09:00.514 --> 09:02.614
Hands up! Stand up!

09:03.736 --> 09:06.622
- There's someone else in the room.
- Hands where I can see them!

09:07.038 --> 09:09.520
I didn't do anything, I didn't
do anything!

09:09.620 --> 09:10.770
Hands up!

09:12.083 --> 09:14.074
- I did nothing.
- Get down!

09:14.174 --> 09:18.042
- There was... there was someone here!
- Get down! Don't resist!

09:18.616 --> 09:19.716
All out!

09:42.070 --> 09:44.420
According to the police report

09:44.582 --> 09:47.151
Witnesses heard the cries,
but they saw no one

09:47.251 --> 09:49.101
leave the room

09:50.741 --> 09:54.591
which it was also locked from the
inside with the safety chain.

09:55.484 --> 09:59.130
The report also indicate that the windows
did not open from the inside,

09:59.333 --> 10:02.650
because, in the winter months,
the hotel takes the handles off,

10:02.750 --> 10:05.200
and that it had not been forced.

10:05.954 --> 10:09.055
They ascertained that any way out
without being seen,

10:09.155 --> 10:12.755
was not possible without
leaving traces.

10:13.042 --> 10:14.842
They found none.

10:15.918 --> 10:19.418
So, according to your version of the
facts, the murderer of your mistress

10:19.989 --> 10:21.692
- vanished into thin air.
- That's it.

10:21.792 --> 10:24.558
- He had to enter first before leaving.
- He was already inside when we arrived.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.833
But he had to get in regardless.

10:27.160 --> 10:31.200
And according to the staff, he could
not enter except with a key like yours.

10:31.300 --> 10:34.275
The whole crime scene was set up
to incriminate me and that

10:34.375 --> 10:38.025
<i>the police would have formulated the false
theory that Laura fell in love with me</i>

10:38.513 --> 10:42.613
<i>and I, to save my marriage, tried unsuccessfully
to buy her off, and then killed her.</i>

10:44.855 --> 10:47.240
<i>- It's an absurd trap.
- Whose?</i>

10:47.340 --> 10:48.290
<i>I don't know.</i>

10:48.390 --> 10:50.506
- Why?
- I tell you I don't know!

10:50.606 --> 10:53.446
The only thing I know is that my wife
has left me and took my daughter with her.

10:53.471 --> 10:55.190
<i>And that someone is
getting away with it.</i>

10:55.290 --> 10:57.218
<i>If you don't pay attention,</i>

10:57.529 --> 11:00.534
<i>if you don't seek answers
in your life, you know what will happen?</i>

11:00.634 --> 11:02.756
<i>- What?
- You'll be confirming the police suspicions.</i>

11:02.930 --> 11:07.146
<i>They believe there's no one who would
have any reason to do this to you.</i>

11:07.605 --> 11:09.355
So your version

11:09.537 --> 11:12.961
- sounds like 'invention', Mr. Doria.
- It's not my responsibility to find the guilty!

11:13.061 --> 11:14.750
- No.
- It's Felix's and yours.

11:14.850 --> 11:18.106
And, of course, the police, who
must catch the culprit. Not me.

11:18.206 --> 11:20.085
You... are the guilty.

11:23.666 --> 11:26.062
Mr. Doria, if you were in my place,

11:26.912 --> 11:29.983
and I describe your theory
of the plot to you, what would you think?

11:30.083 --> 11:33.525
I'm describing what happened.
I don't know what else is expected of me.

11:33.625 --> 11:34.425
You know?

11:37.542 --> 11:41.492
In the 30 years of my career, I have had to
deal with two types of clients.

11:42.154 --> 11:44.525
Those who take responsibility
and cooperate,

11:44.625 --> 11:47.069
although it would mean to go where
they don't want to,

11:47.169 --> 11:49.340
and those who think are smarter
than me and expect

11:49.440 --> 11:52.640
that I save them from a guilty sentence,
without getting their hands dirty.

11:53.055 --> 11:54.855
You belong to the latter.

11:55.388 --> 11:58.288
But let me be clear about two
things.

12:05.570 --> 12:08.070
There'll be no salvation
without suffering

12:08.705 --> 12:10.605
and you're not smarter than me.

12:18.666 --> 12:21.295
<i>Youth Missing in Bierge</i>

12:23.857 --> 12:27.457
Have you wondered if the new prosecution
witness had anything to do with this?

12:27.670 --> 12:31.059
<i>The disappearance of Daniel Garrido -
Shy and responsible young man</i>

12:31.991 --> 12:34.691
We have already lost 10 minutes, Mr.
Doria.

12:35.417 --> 12:37.567
I'll ask you just once.

12:40.098 --> 12:43.249
Do you know who was the man
in that hotel room?

12:49.871 --> 12:51.471
If you want to know, if you want me

12:51.625 --> 12:53.934
to get you out of the mess you are in

12:54.034 --> 12:55.612
and avoid jail time,

12:56.459 --> 12:57.859
don't lie to me anymore.

13:14.133 --> 13:16.033
<i>It all started about three months ago.</i>

13:24.909 --> 13:26.631
- Darling.
- How's Paris?

13:28.903 --> 13:31.984
- Full of nasty French.
- The meeting didn't go well?

13:32.084 --> 13:34.306
- I don't think we'll close.
- <i>My father called.</i>

13:34.406 --> 13:36.025
He's invited us to go sailing on Sunday.

13:36.125 --> 13:39.003
I told him we're going.
He's dying to see Alex.

13:39.103 --> 13:40.603
<i>- All right.</i>
- It's dad!

13:40.976 --> 13:42.276
Let's see, say dad.

13:42.635 --> 13:43.435
Dad!

13:44.081 --> 13:46.471
Listen, Sonia I have to
get to the airport.

13:46.571 --> 13:49.387
<i>OK. Are you coming home or
are you staying in Barcelona?</i>

13:54.433 --> 13:55.933
I'm coming home.

13:56.224 --> 13:57.824
Let me know when you're boarding.

13:58.230 --> 13:59.080
I love you.

13:59.333 --> 14:00.233
Me too.

14:08.854 --> 14:09.754
Who was it?

14:10.031 --> 14:11.031
It was Sonia.

14:11.709 --> 14:12.858
What time is it?

14:13.199 --> 14:15.699
It's almost six.
We fell asleep.

14:24.420 --> 14:25.320
<i>Dad.</i>

14:29.903 --> 14:30.870
<i>Dad.</i>

14:33.546 --> 14:34.446
Shall we?

15:13.913 --> 15:17.313
- The GPS did not say that.
- Yeah, but through here it's quicker.

15:17.721 --> 15:19.571
You could also go faster, right?

15:21.573 --> 15:23.293
- Should I drive?
- You are already driving.

15:27.878 --> 15:28.828
What's up'?

15:30.667 --> 15:32.517
I spend the days lying.

15:35.804 --> 15:38.154
I don't think that when you're with me
you do.

15:40.820 --> 15:43.670
The rest of the day I lie
'cause I'm with you.

15:44.416 --> 15:46.566
But being with me makes you happy.

15:47.212 --> 15:47.940
Doesn't it?

15:49.704 --> 15:53.254
I love how I feel when we're together.

15:54.565 --> 15:57.442
Remember what we said when
we first got together?

15:57.652 --> 15:59.852
That's what both wanted.

16:02.568 --> 16:06.309
- And when also said that the time would come...
- Adrian, you want to leave Sonia?

16:06.409 --> 16:08.159
- No.
- I don't want to leave Bruno either.

16:08.411 --> 16:10.561
That's why this is perfect for us.

16:12.838 --> 16:14.938
Yeah, but you can't have it all.

16:15.707 --> 16:18.057
You always have to
sacrifice something.

16:20.401 --> 16:21.501
We're fine.

16:23.791 --> 16:26.152
- Everything is alright!
- No, what we do is wrong.

16:26.252 --> 16:27.102
You know it.

16:31.837 --> 16:32.737
It's done...

16:37.503 --> 16:38.603
I'm sorry.

16:56.171 --> 16:57.171
Are you OK?

16:59.355 --> 17:00.355
I don't know.

17:32.917 --> 17:33.717
Hey...

17:47.967 --> 17:48.967
Are you OK?

18:08.015 --> 18:09.115
Oh, shit...

18:16.030 --> 18:17.857
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

18:17.882 --> 18:20.650
- It's not our fault.
- No, I invaded his lane.

18:20.750 --> 18:22.600
He has the belt, you know?
He was on his cell phone.

18:22.625 --> 18:24.608
If you hadn't made me race
I could have reacted.

18:24.708 --> 18:26.358
What did you tell me before?

18:26.611 --> 18:29.324
- That you have to sacrifice something, right?
- What are you saying?

18:29.349 --> 18:31.099
That it's him or us, Adrian!

18:31.537 --> 18:33.400
If you call the
police we are lost.

18:33.500 --> 18:36.050
Listen, listen!
Listen to me, please.

18:36.729 --> 18:38.429
Nobody saw anything.

18:39.251 --> 18:40.318
Nobody knows anything.

18:40.418 --> 18:43.018
Nothing's changed.
Your life, Sonia...

18:43.688 --> 18:44.738
your daughter,

18:45.862 --> 18:47.162
your career.

18:49.583 --> 18:51.533
You don't want to lose everything, right?

18:53.797 --> 18:54.547
True?

19:04.250 --> 19:05.350
Let's go.

19:21.667 --> 19:22.667
It won't start.

19:24.035 --> 19:26.413
Come on, please, come on, turn over!

19:26.513 --> 19:29.313
- Adrian...
- Why, no fucking way! Let's go.

19:30.915 --> 19:31.765
Watch out.

19:32.246 --> 19:34.296
- What's up'?
- Someone's coming.

19:41.499 --> 19:43.099
Get out of the car.

19:51.598 --> 19:53.016
- What do we do?
- Let me handle it.

19:53.116 --> 19:55.136
- Let me.
- Where are you going? Hey!

20:12.016 --> 20:12.916
He'll figure it out.

20:13.756 --> 20:15.456
Can you tell me what you are doing?

20:16.090 --> 20:17.490
We bumped...

20:17.860 --> 20:20.310
- How did we...
- rules of the game.

20:25.426 --> 20:26.226
Hello.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.200
You need help?
What happened to you?

20:32.335 --> 20:36.085
Nothing, I swerved and I hit him,
but we are exchanging information.

20:36.329 --> 20:38.879
- You want me call an ambulance or something?
- No, no.

20:39.368 --> 20:41.618
Really.
We're fine, thanks.

20:44.170 --> 20:45.020
Sure?

21:00.882 --> 21:03.832
Must be the guys from the insurance.
Be right back, OK?

21:08.960 --> 21:09.660
Hey.

21:11.037 --> 21:12.337
Pretty scary, right?

21:12.815 --> 21:16.465
A deer crossed the road.
I'm still a bit shaken up.

21:20.875 --> 21:21.675
Yes'...

21:22.313 --> 21:24.453
Yes, I called earlier.

21:24.553 --> 21:26.303
- Sure?
- Yes, thank you.

21:31.540 --> 21:33.390
How long do you think they'll take?

21:42.113 --> 21:43.513
OK, goodbye.

21:46.317 --> 21:47.617
It's all settled.

21:47.917 --> 21:50.192
I'm glad it was nothing.

21:50.292 --> 21:51.142
Thank you.

21:51.709 --> 21:53.709
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

21:57.295 --> 21:58.841
- What if he saw anything?
- He hasn't seen anything.

21:58.866 --> 22:01.150
- And if he saw the guy?
- We have to get rid of it.

22:01.250 --> 22:03.775
- Are you crazy?
- There's a witness, don't you see?

22:03.875 --> 22:06.775
If we leave him here, the guy
will know we lied.

22:07.608 --> 22:08.658
Please!

22:23.156 --> 22:26.006
It's best if I stay here to ask
for help.

22:26.582 --> 22:27.354
All right?

22:27.454 --> 22:29.404
And you take care of the body.

22:30.653 --> 22:31.853
What do I do with it?

22:32.922 --> 22:33.922
I don't know.

22:34.526 --> 22:37.626
I don't know, but we have to get
rid of everything, all right?

22:39.292 --> 22:42.292
And then, if it's what you want,
we stop seeing each other.

22:44.191 --> 22:45.191
It's over.

23:07.376 --> 23:09.076
<i>I drove for almost an hour.</i>

23:10.542 --> 23:14.792
<i>And the only thing I could think of is why I
was there instead of being with my family.</i>

23:17.678 --> 23:19.628
If I hadn't been with Laura...

23:20.053 --> 23:23.953
if we had not fallen asleep, if
we hadn't taken the other road...

23:27.245 --> 23:30.395
that deer would never have
crossed my path.

23:31.209 --> 23:31.909
Never.

23:37.333 --> 23:39.083
What did you do with the car?

23:42.875 --> 23:44.025
I sank it.

23:46.949 --> 23:48.299
With the guy in it?

26:15.417 --> 26:18.167
Laura's words kept resonating in
my head.

26:22.224 --> 26:26.074
It had been an accident and we
couldn't help the lad.

26:26.774 --> 26:29.024
He had no future, but we did.

26:29.472 --> 26:30.422
We did.

26:38.706 --> 26:41.461
That guy was like
one of these spots.

26:43.273 --> 26:46.373
I had to learn to see it like that
so I wouldn't go crazy.

26:51.002 --> 26:52.202
What did you do after?

26:54.637 --> 26:57.687
I called Laura with a prepaid phone
and told her where I was.

26:58.185 --> 27:01.185
We always used prepaid to
communicate with each other.

27:14.101 --> 27:15.551
It was horrible.

27:17.167 --> 27:18.467
What happened?

27:19.034 --> 27:20.620
Hello, I have car problems.

27:20.720 --> 27:23.620
No, I'm fine, but I
need a tow truck.

27:23.916 --> 27:24.616
Yes.

27:25.432 --> 27:26.632
Where I am?

27:31.331 --> 27:32.340
<i>Call</i>

28:19.271 --> 28:21.150
- Hello.
- Good evening, everything OK?

28:21.250 --> 28:24.392
Yes, a deer crossed my path,
but I'm fine, thank you.

28:24.492 --> 28:26.946
You were lucky, you might
have killed yourself.

28:27.046 --> 28:28.296
No power.

28:28.558 --> 28:31.367
The engine, I do not know, it doesn't
start and I called for roadside assistance,

28:31.392 --> 28:33.433
but they're very busy and they don't
know how long it will take them.

28:33.458 --> 28:35.114
There's always a solution.

28:35.214 --> 28:37.805
I know these cars really well, these
machines, are good.

28:37.905 --> 28:39.255
Coincidentally...

28:39.432 --> 28:41.808
years ago, I worked as an engineer in
their Spanish headquarters.

28:41.833 --> 28:44.133
Tomas Garrido.
Now, I have a repair shop.

28:45.062 --> 28:46.262
Nice to meet you.

28:47.556 --> 28:50.156
- I have to get to Barcelona.
- Do you have a flashlight?

28:55.440 --> 28:59.390
The car is my sister's. She lent
it to me, and I'm not sure where...

29:00.750 --> 29:02.200
Don't worry...

29:02.583 --> 29:03.783
I'll get mine.

29:17.583 --> 29:19.277
Yeah, it's the starter.

29:22.141 --> 29:25.942
Probably, the motor sensor
is blocked.

29:26.042 --> 29:27.892
If there's nothing else,

29:28.302 --> 29:31.702
only that it needs the unit
to be reset.

29:32.305 --> 29:34.005
It looks like the rest is okay.

29:34.533 --> 29:38.456
If you wish, I can tow it
to my house, and I'll fix it there.

29:41.605 --> 29:45.655
If you prefer I can call a truck
and tell them where they can find you.

29:45.814 --> 29:47.147
How long would it take?

29:47.247 --> 29:50.497
- The tow truck?
- No, you fixing the engine.

29:50.972 --> 29:52.772
A couple of hours, at most.

29:53.244 --> 29:54.244
OK.

30:00.043 --> 30:01.793
So, you live in Barcelona.

30:03.533 --> 30:04.933
And what brings you here?

30:05.575 --> 30:07.525
My sister lives in Barbastro.

30:08.836 --> 30:12.525
My wife worked there, in the
the natural park reserve.

30:12.784 --> 30:16.534
Now, she works near Bierge, in the
valley, 20 minutes from home.

30:19.417 --> 30:22.775
First, she was a teacher of
Literature, but she had to abandon.

30:22.875 --> 30:23.875
Cancer.

30:25.708 --> 30:29.708
That's why we came to live here.
To have a quieter life.

30:30.000 --> 30:31.050
What do you do?

30:40.248 --> 30:41.548
I have a book shop.

30:42.893 --> 30:43.993
I love reading.

30:45.784 --> 30:47.284
Especially about theater.

30:47.500 --> 30:49.500
My weakness are the classics.

30:49.785 --> 30:51.567
My wife made me discover them.

30:51.667 --> 30:54.817
That's how we met. In a theater group.

30:55.160 --> 30:58.010
She got along very well, but
to be honest

30:58.110 --> 31:00.310
I just signed up to go along.

31:03.334 --> 31:05.784
You haven't told me your name yet.

31:06.928 --> 31:08.428
- Raquel.
- Raquel.

31:10.958 --> 31:13.258
Raquel, the cell phone is ringing.

31:14.955 --> 31:16.055
Ah, it's true.

31:21.548 --> 31:23.463
- Hi, darling.
<i>- Hello, Laura.</i>

31:23.563 --> 31:26.067
<i>How 'was the meeting?
When do you board?</i>

31:26.167 --> 31:28.440
Well, I was about to call you.
I'm gonna be late.

31:28.540 --> 31:29.190
<i>OK.</i>

31:29.290 --> 31:32.560
Well, look I am bringing home some incident
reports that I can't finish here.

31:31.344 --> 31:32.564
<i>TH - Banking Group</i>

31:32.664 --> 31:34.053
Too many interruptions.

31:34.153 --> 31:36.853
<i>- But what happened? Why the delay?</i>
- Nothing...

31:37.343 --> 31:39.550
A mishap, something wrong with the
engine, I don't know.

31:39.650 --> 31:42.192
<i>That's OK, let me know when
you're leaving.</i>

31:42.292 --> 31:44.019
No, no it's not necessary that you
come get me.

31:44.044 --> 31:47.067
No, I'll eat something here and
continue until I'll pick you up.

31:47.167 --> 31:48.858
Please don't come get me, Bruno, please.

31:48.958 --> 31:51.858
- Laura... are you okay?
- <i>I'm sorry, I'm sorry. No, no.</i>

31:52.101 --> 31:55.682
There's nothing, I'm fine now.
I regret not having called you before.

31:55.782 --> 31:58.451
It's OK, don't worry.
I'll see you later at home.

31:58.551 --> 32:00.266
- I love you.
- Me too.

32:10.707 --> 32:11.807
Hello, love.

32:12.783 --> 32:14.983
Elvira, my wife.
She's Raquel.

32:15.278 --> 32:18.684
She hit a deer, and the engine
starter is blocked. I'll fix it for her.

32:18.784 --> 32:20.768
- Nice to meet you.
- Me too.

32:20.868 --> 32:23.168
Are you hurt?
You have blood on your hand.

32:25.100 --> 32:27.500
- It probably was the deer's.
- The deer's?

32:27.683 --> 32:29.723
Let me take a look. Some
wounds can become infected.

32:29.792 --> 32:31.192
No, I have no injuries.

32:32.654 --> 32:34.393
Excuse me, but I'm in a big hurry.

32:34.493 --> 32:37.067
Well then, no more talk,
I'll start to work.

32:37.167 --> 32:39.483
- Do you want some coffee?
- Yes, please.

32:39.583 --> 32:41.769
- Come in.
- No, I can wait here. No problem.

32:41.869 --> 32:44.046
You can't stay here, it's very cold.
Come on in.

32:44.146 --> 32:45.896
What's the problem? Get cleaned up.
Come in.

32:46.290 --> 32:47.090
Come.

33:11.341 --> 33:12.391
Everything OK?

33:12.932 --> 33:14.358
Yes, yes thank you. It's all right.

33:14.458 --> 33:16.608
I'm gonna take the coffee to Tomas
and be back.

33:17.042 --> 33:18.342
Okay, thanks.

34:16.857 --> 34:20.206
We, too, we had a pair of frights
when we came here.

34:20.400 --> 34:22.201
You sure you don't want to eat
anything?

34:22.380 --> 34:23.880
No, no, no. Thank you.

34:24.926 --> 34:28.275
This is a good place to live but
you need to adapt.

34:29.875 --> 34:30.675
Children?

34:32.752 --> 34:35.804
- Do you have any children? I see that...
- Ah! No, no. No.

34:37.081 --> 34:39.531
My husband would
like to, well, I...

34:39.868 --> 34:42.261
work too much and not...
I don't know very well.

34:42.360 --> 34:44.161
Oh, well, don't be dismayed.

34:44.495 --> 34:47.938
I had Dani, well, Daniel, he does
not like me to call him Dani,

34:48.039 --> 34:50.839
was I was almost 40.
A child changes your life.

34:53.244 --> 34:55.293
But it also gives you everything.
Sorry.

34:58.157 --> 35:01.557
Look, how handsome. He'll be here any
minute now so you'll get to meet him.

35:03.780 --> 35:04.580
Clara?

35:05.191 --> 35:06.041
Hi.

35:07.156 --> 35:10.006
No, I'm waiting for him.
We went out with his friends.

35:11.450 --> 35:12.200
What?

35:14.016 --> 35:15.166
Are you're with them?

35:17.694 --> 35:19.094
And Daniel is not there?

35:21.102 --> 35:22.252
That's weird...

35:22.614 --> 35:24.164
if he left at 6!

35:28.298 --> 35:28.998
Yes.

35:29.966 --> 35:33.566
He came back from work,
changed and left.

35:36.205 --> 35:36.842
Yes.

35:36.942 --> 35:40.092
Well, that's it. I reset it
and it works perfectly.

35:40.375 --> 35:42.075
Are you staying for dinner?

35:42.379 --> 35:44.251
I'm sure my wife convinced you already.

35:44.351 --> 35:45.251
All right.

35:45.677 --> 35:48.238
No, really, I'm very
late, I'm sorry.

35:48.338 --> 35:51.088
Yes, all right, Clara.
Okay, I'll call you.

35:54.442 --> 35:58.642
Clara says that the boys have not
seen Daniel. They thought he was with her.

36:00.480 --> 36:01.680
What do you mean?

36:02.567 --> 36:05.787
That he should be with his friends, but
no one knows anything about him.

36:05.887 --> 36:07.437
Did you say anything?

36:07.813 --> 36:10.863
Come on, don't get antsy.
Maybe he had other plans.

36:10.963 --> 36:13.998
Sure, Tomas, but he told me
he would be with his friends.

36:14.098 --> 36:16.288
Maybe, he didn't tell you the truth.

36:16.388 --> 36:17.288
Why?

36:18.346 --> 36:20.246
And if he met another girl?

36:21.051 --> 36:22.400
But, no, Tomas. No.

36:22.500 --> 36:24.100
It's all very strange.

36:24.204 --> 36:25.404
I'm going to call him.

36:30.334 --> 36:32.934
Calm down. He's a big boy now.

36:40.440 --> 36:41.240
Do you hear?

36:42.000 --> 36:42.700
Yes.

36:42.891 --> 36:43.641
<i>Mom</i>

36:45.411 --> 36:46.811
I heard.

36:52.186 --> 36:54.586
- Did you hear a cell phone ringing here?
- No.

36:55.709 --> 36:57.309
I'll call him again.

36:59.125 --> 37:00.175
My son.

37:00.706 --> 37:04.406
He's not with his friends, and my
wife imagines God knows what.

37:22.561 --> 37:23.411
Here it is.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.217
That's weird.

37:26.977 --> 37:29.224
Daniel never goes out
without his mobile phone.

37:29.324 --> 37:31.650
It probably fell off and he didn't
realize it.

37:31.750 --> 37:33.450
You tell her, Raquel.

37:33.872 --> 37:36.622
I have to go, really,
I'm very late.

37:58.746 --> 38:00.646
Nobody knows anything about Daniel.

38:17.750 --> 38:18.750
What now?

38:21.830 --> 38:23.130
Tell me what we do.

38:26.958 --> 38:29.008
I just thought of something

38:32.356 --> 38:34.056
But I'm in your hands.

38:39.409 --> 38:40.609
It depends on you.

38:45.720 --> 38:47.620
<i>The look in her eyes scared me.</i>

38:47.720 --> 38:48.970
<i>Scrap Yard</i>

38:49.803 --> 38:53.153
I made my car disappear
without a trace.

39:07.997 --> 39:09.297
Well, I don't know...

39:09.661 --> 39:12.161
It's located in front
of a scrap yard.

39:19.768 --> 39:23.808
<i>Then I said goodbye to her with the understanding
that it would be the last time we'd see each other.</i>

39:32.184 --> 39:34.424
<i>When I got to town I reported the
car theft to the police,</i>

39:34.449 --> 39:36.999
<i>pretending to be
returning from Paris,</i>

39:38.949 --> 39:40.688
<i>and so I told Sonia.</i>

39:40.788 --> 39:44.116
<i>I told her that I would stop to sleep
in the apartment in the city.</i>

39:44.216 --> 39:45.356
But you're okay?

39:45.456 --> 39:47.256
<i>I did not sleep all night.</i>

39:47.875 --> 39:50.525
<i>But I felt a fraud, an impostor.</i>

39:51.525 --> 39:54.625
<i>One that had taken 10 years
to climb to the top...</i>

39:55.939 --> 39:59.090
<i>but in an instant, I
could lose everything.</i>

40:01.745 --> 40:03.895
<i>The next day, I went to work.</i>

40:04.792 --> 40:08.275
<i>We were preparing the entry of
Go Global Tech Media, Asia,</i>

40:08.375 --> 40:11.175
<i>and it would have looked strange
if I had not shown up.</i>

40:12.451 --> 40:15.601
<i>For more than a year, I had tried
to conclude the agreement.</i>

40:15.897 --> 40:19.297
<i>And now it was going to happen I
could not ruin it.</i>

40:25.587 --> 40:28.067
<i>Before returning home, I
tried to arrange my thoughts,</i>

40:28.167 --> 40:31.317
<i>to present myself in front
of my wife and my daughter.</i>

40:33.725 --> 40:35.207
<i>I had to put a mask,</i>

40:35.307 --> 40:38.951
<i>so that they wouldn't the man I wasn't
but one that should have been.</i>

40:44.292 --> 40:48.194
<i>And when it looked that I had succeeded...
the inevitable happened.</i>

40:48.389 --> 40:51.239
<i>Daniel Garrido, 23, came
out from work in this</i>

40:51.339 --> 40:54.462
<i>bank branch, at around
six in the evening.</i>

40:54.865 --> 40:59.010
<i>So he went home and soon
after came out again.</i>

40:59.417 --> 41:03.058
<i>His parents were waiting for him
at dinner time, but have not received
news of him since then.</i>

41:03.083 --> 41:05.332
<i>Relatives and friends
gathered to search for him.</i>

41:05.432 --> 41:07.604
<i>They believe he probably
was involved in an accident.</i>

41:07.704 --> 41:11.438
<i>His car might be
invisible in a forest ravine.</i>

41:13.125 --> 41:16.225
<i>The face of that father was
imprinted in the retina of my eyes.</i>

41:16.883 --> 41:18.883
I projected his grief.

41:22.613 --> 41:26.813
But I swore that this would be the last
mistake that I would make in my life.

41:29.353 --> 41:30.903
- Excuse me.
- Go ahead.

41:35.125 --> 41:35.925
Tell me.

41:36.974 --> 41:39.652
<i>The prosecution new witness
has arrived in court.</i>

41:39.752 --> 41:40.752
Are you sure?

41:41.902 --> 41:44.552
<i>Not much time left, you
have to make him hurry.</i>

41:44.726 --> 41:46.476
Let me know if there are further news.

41:52.951 --> 41:55.961
The prosecution witness
has arrived at court.

41:56.061 --> 41:59.461
No word yet on who he is, but
the judge is on his way.

42:02.472 --> 42:04.122
I have to talk to Felix.

42:07.750 --> 42:09.377
- Tell me.
<i>- Felix, where are you?</i>

42:09.477 --> 42:11.410
I'm coming from Bilbao.

42:11.510 --> 42:14.484
<i>Virginia Goodman is here because it seems
that the prosecution has gone ahead of us.</i>

42:14.509 --> 42:15.829
What do you mean the prosecution?

42:15.917 --> 42:18.249
<i>- Look, when do you get back?</i>
- Tonight, on the last flight.

42:18.274 --> 42:19.274
<i>Put her on.</i>

42:20.136 --> 42:21.736
He wants to talk to you.

42:24.833 --> 42:26.533
- Felix?
<i>- What's going on?</i>

42:26.770 --> 42:29.567
A new witness.
He just arrived at court.

42:29.667 --> 42:30.567
Virginia?

42:30.667 --> 42:33.775
It's very likely that Mr.
Doria be compelled to testify tonight.

42:33.875 --> 42:36.427
Send me the details in writing,
but I leave it up to you.

42:36.527 --> 42:39.334
<i>I'm on a big break, perhaps
very beneficial for the case.</i>

42:39.434 --> 42:42.984
- <i>I'll call in a couple of hours.</i>
- OK. Thank you, Felix.

42:55.449 --> 42:56.749
What did he say?

43:00.957 --> 43:03.507
Everything's under control.
Don't worry.

43:03.614 --> 43:05.780
Well, let's continue.
Where were we?

43:07.935 --> 43:09.435
I resumed my life.

43:12.568 --> 43:14.168
<i>Then the police arrived.</i>

43:14.778 --> 43:16.678
Mr. Doria, you have visitors.

43:16.873 --> 43:18.073
It's the police.

43:19.815 --> 43:22.565
There's no record of it.
How do you know?

43:23.667 --> 43:25.417
The details, Mr. Doria.

43:37.000 --> 43:40.775
Police in Bierge found the
remains of two collisions,

43:40.875 --> 43:44.256
5 km from where the deceased
lived.

43:44.797 --> 43:48.447
But there's no record of any
party involved in both accidents.

43:49.299 --> 43:52.317
The curious thing is that the
boy's father picked up a woman,

43:52.417 --> 43:55.017
who had had an accident right here,

43:55.205 --> 43:58.155
the same day his son disappeared.

44:06.491 --> 44:07.541
You know her?

44:22.039 --> 44:24.039
- What is this?
- Let's see...

44:24.139 --> 44:28.189
Why would my client care what happened
in Bierge, when he was in Paris?

44:28.333 --> 44:30.959
This woman said to the
father of the missing boy

44:31.059 --> 44:32.619
that she hit a deer.

44:33.416 --> 44:36.459
But the remains of a second
vehicle on the road

44:36.824 --> 44:38.574
force us to hypothesize

44:38.674 --> 44:42.520
something has happened that was
concealed with the help of a companion.

44:42.620 --> 44:43.220
So?

44:43.578 --> 44:46.278
The license plate of the car
driven by this woman

44:46.577 --> 44:49.650
belongs to a BMW which is
registered to your client.

44:49.750 --> 44:53.550
And that was stolen from a
private parking that weekend.

44:53.659 --> 44:56.838
Are you insinuating that Mr. Doria
is trying to hide an accident

44:56.938 --> 44:58.438
for which there's no evidence?

44:58.708 --> 45:00.794
According to the complaint,
you could not provide

45:00.894 --> 45:03.915
a parking ticket that would prove
that the car was where you said it was.

45:04.015 --> 45:05.065
I lost it.

45:05.708 --> 45:08.757
It was in my wallet, which I left in
my jacket. I lost it during my journey.

45:08.857 --> 45:12.150
Yes, I know. So you said at the police
station. Very convenient, isn't it?

45:12.250 --> 45:13.239
One moment.

45:13.339 --> 45:17.089
The license plate information was
given by the father of the deceased?

45:18.458 --> 45:20.519
That's very convenient.

45:20.619 --> 45:24.723
- And an unverified clue.
- That's we want... verify!

45:24.823 --> 45:28.763
It wasn't necessary to disturb my
client to check his trip to Paris.

45:28.863 --> 45:31.663
It was sufficient to ask his secretary
for the details.

45:32.751 --> 45:34.001
Are we finished?

45:40.125 --> 45:41.925
Why are you so nervous?

45:45.558 --> 45:47.658
Tell me, or I won't be able to help.

45:48.375 --> 45:51.975
Does the disappearance of this boy has
anything to do with you?

45:52.458 --> 45:53.308
Then?

45:59.273 --> 46:00.973
I was not in Paris.

46:03.739 --> 46:05.489
I was with a woman.

46:06.761 --> 46:10.661
So Eva can't prove to the
police that you were in Paris.

46:11.597 --> 46:14.650
Can you make them believe I was there?
Can you buy me an alibi?

46:14.750 --> 46:18.000
- Do I have any alternative?
- I left her. It was a mistake.

46:18.801 --> 46:20.949
I can not allow this bloody coincidence

46:21.049 --> 46:23.949
to ruin my life with Alex and Sonia.
I can't.

46:24.542 --> 46:28.141
The next time you call me, start
by telling me everything.

46:33.404 --> 46:35.054
I'm gonna need something else.

46:38.218 --> 46:39.168
What?

46:40.162 --> 46:43.512
The police report.
I don't want this to haunt me.

46:45.145 --> 46:46.445
I will take care of it.

46:47.437 --> 46:50.975
<i>Days later, the police confirmed that I had
been to Paris and they forgot the whole affair.</i>

46:51.000 --> 46:54.700
Felix satisfied the first part of
the agreement, but not the second.

46:55.397 --> 46:59.247
One of my source managed to find
your name in the police archives.

46:59.583 --> 47:02.633
And I'm afraid the prosecution
has also obtained it.

47:07.775 --> 47:10.150
I would not have come this far were
it not for Laura.

47:10.250 --> 47:13.807
What did you do when the police
reached out to you to identify her?

47:13.907 --> 47:15.357
I did not tell her.

47:17.125 --> 47:18.625
I know you contacted her.

47:19.186 --> 47:22.045
Rich people don't want to stop being
rich and protect themselves

47:22.145 --> 47:23.442
<i>Protect what they have.</i>

47:23.542 --> 47:28.343
<i>Go where the rich are... and
you will find security cameras everywhere.</i>

47:28.443 --> 47:31.775
How did you convince the
police that Daniel Garrido ran away?

47:31.875 --> 47:33.125
Where are you calling from?

47:34.167 --> 47:35.442
The phone booth at the port.

47:35.542 --> 47:38.542
Speaking in a place so well protected is
not a very prudent move, Mr. Doria.

47:38.595 --> 47:40.495
My nerves betrayed me, I know.

47:42.953 --> 47:45.526
But, come on, don't think me so stupid
to contact Laura

47:45.626 --> 47:48.763
just after police try to
involve me with her.

47:48.863 --> 47:50.613
Then, when and why?

47:53.393 --> 47:55.643
When I didn't know what else to do.

47:58.347 --> 48:01.397
<i>Laura would not stop when
she had what she wanted.</i>

48:04.016 --> 48:06.416
<i>She did it with me
when we first met.</i>

48:08.110 --> 48:11.610
<i>She was doing it again to forget
everything that had happened.</i>

48:12.042 --> 48:14.843
<i>and the police have ruled out
that Daniel Garrido,</i>

48:14.943 --> 48:17.943
<i>the boy from Bierge, who
disappeared three weeks ago,</i>

48:18.257 --> 48:21.457
<i>had an accident.
According to latest research,</i>

48:21.625 --> 48:24.834
<i>Garrido may have pretended
to have disappeared,</i>

48:25.197 --> 48:26.275
<i>to run away.</i>

48:26.375 --> 48:28.543
<i>Police sources reported</i>

48:28.643 --> 48:32.663
<i>the boy took possession of
50,000 euros of the bank branch,</i>

48:32.763 --> 48:33.858
<i>where he worked.</i>

48:33.958 --> 48:37.775
<i>Daniel Garrido took away small quantities'
from the accounts of its customers...</i>

48:37.875 --> 48:39.625
Ready to set sail, dear?

48:41.365 --> 48:44.358
I just learned that I have
an urgent meeting with Lee.

48:44.458 --> 48:46.708
- Where are you calling from?
- From a booth.

48:49.378 --> 48:52.828
We'll meet in four hours in the
bar in front of the junk yard.

49:04.311 --> 49:05.611
What is this'?

49:07.116 --> 49:08.966
The boy's wallet.

49:10.510 --> 49:13.160
I took it before putting
him in the trunk.

49:15.708 --> 49:18.908
I thought it could be
useful and so it has.

49:20.403 --> 49:23.903
After the accident, Bruno worked
at home for a few days.

49:24.875 --> 49:28.875
I took the opportunity to put an end
to all this, in the only way possible.

50:27.919 --> 50:30.819
<i>Successfully completed
Money Transfer</i>

50:32.208 --> 50:33.658
<i>What are you telling me?</i>

50:33.886 --> 50:36.596
<i>Your mistress was an expert
in banking IT system,</i>

50:36.696 --> 50:38.196
<i>as well as a photographer?</i>

50:38.408 --> 50:40.292
Do you think that the
jurors are stupid?

50:40.392 --> 50:42.267
She met her husband while working
as a clerk at the bank.

50:42.292 --> 50:46.709
Information technology is making headway by giant
leaps, you should know this better than anyone.

50:46.958 --> 50:49.650
Your mistress was keeping up,
while she was a photographer?

50:49.750 --> 50:51.700
Perhaps she was helped by her husband.

50:51.998 --> 50:56.148
Maybe she told him the truth but
didn't tell me to keep me out.

50:56.248 --> 50:57.948
You didn't know Laura.

50:58.837 --> 51:00.765
When she wanted something, she
would deceive and persuade.

51:00.790 --> 51:03.240
The perfect prototype
of a <i>femme fatale</i>.

51:03.625 --> 51:05.775
Do you realize what you've done?

51:06.758 --> 51:08.008
What do you think?

51:09.650 --> 51:10.973
Don't worry.

51:11.073 --> 51:14.073
If I had left any tracks,
we wouldn't be here.

51:15.775 --> 51:16.525
What?

51:17.559 --> 51:19.759
What? Don't give me that look!

51:20.291 --> 51:22.558
You didn't call the police because
you knew what we were doing was right.

51:22.583 --> 51:24.333
No, we didn't do the right thing.

51:25.346 --> 51:26.196
Adrian.

51:27.548 --> 51:30.466
If I fall, you'll be right behind me.

51:30.667 --> 51:32.517
The police came to see me.

51:33.750 --> 51:35.050
Don't threaten me.

51:36.667 --> 51:39.292
And you don't threaten me!

51:41.165 --> 51:44.215
I have pictures that prove that
you had not been to Paris.

52:26.040 --> 52:29.240
<i>The days that followed
were not exactly quiet.</i>

52:29.649 --> 52:32.561
<i>My company arrival in Asia, hand
in hand with a technology giant</i>

52:32.661 --> 52:34.261
<i>most 'powerful in the world.</i>

52:35.037 --> 52:38.587
<i>They attributed me with the award
of entrepreneur of the year.</i>

52:39.042 --> 52:41.692
<i>I went head first into the
media hurricane.</i>

52:46.671 --> 52:48.571
Mr. Doria, how do you feel?

52:50.095 --> 52:51.245
Very happy.

52:51.417 --> 52:53.967
<i>They sold me as the 'man
of the moment'.</i>

52:54.708 --> 52:58.508
<i>An example for young people like me who
came from nothing and turned into a winner.</i>

52:59.458 --> 53:01.058
<i>But it was pure appearance.</i>

53:01.750 --> 53:03.750
<i>I felt broken for a long time.</i>

53:04.288 --> 53:05.138
<i>Rotten.</i>

53:17.405 --> 53:18.725
- Mr. Doria.
- Yes?

53:18.825 --> 53:20.942
A reporter wants to talk to you.

53:21.042 --> 53:22.492
He says he knows you.

53:22.920 --> 53:23.620
Yes.

53:25.000 --> 53:27.650
If you'll excuse me.
Be careful with that.

53:29.639 --> 53:30.489
See you later.

53:35.579 --> 53:38.029
- To the right, please.
- Yes, thanks.

53:53.311 --> 53:54.461
Mr. Doria.

53:54.958 --> 53:58.158
Sorry to bother you
on such a special day.

54:00.792 --> 54:01.892
You know who I am?

54:03.196 --> 54:04.903
<i>Ivan Souto 'El Periodico'</i>

54:05.003 --> 54:07.003
I just know that you're not Ivan Souto.

54:15.376 --> 54:16.176
Please.

54:17.739 --> 54:19.068
I am Daniel Garrido's father.

54:19.168 --> 54:21.668
I don't know if you saw the news, but...

54:23.001 --> 54:24.481
and they say he fled and, well...

54:24.581 --> 54:27.431
I'd like to ask you
some questions, if I may.

54:29.880 --> 54:32.780
All I know of your son is what
the newspapers say.

54:32.880 --> 54:35.530
- I'm sorry.
- My son is not a thief.

54:36.678 --> 54:38.878
And he didn't run away.

54:39.199 --> 54:40.699
My son is dead.

54:41.181 --> 54:44.431
Someone is laughing at
my wife and at me.

54:45.714 --> 54:49.664
The day that the police spoke
to you, Elvira and I were there.

54:52.823 --> 54:54.123
<i>I know what I saw.</i>

54:54.500 --> 54:56.214
<i>Our son used his cell phone</i>

54:56.314 --> 55:00.314
<i>until shortly before Tomas
picked up that woman on the road.</i>

55:00.417 --> 55:03.560
So, it was impossible that
the phone was at home,

55:03.660 --> 55:05.940
unless she brought it with her.

55:06.040 --> 55:07.679
This could only have happened

55:07.779 --> 55:10.679
if she crossed paths with
our son at some point.

55:11.073 --> 55:13.692
And then, she was not alone.
There was someone else with her.

55:13.792 --> 55:17.142
- But how can you be so sure?
- I already told you!

55:17.792 --> 55:20.892
<i>She adjusted her seat
before putting it into gear.</i>

55:21.715 --> 55:23.015
<i>She was not driving.</i>

55:23.659 --> 55:24.571
She lied.

55:24.671 --> 55:28.150
The car is my sister's. She lent
to me, and I'm not sure where...

55:28.250 --> 55:31.117
She lied... and nobody lies
without a reason.

55:33.074 --> 55:34.724
She lied to protect herself.

55:35.792 --> 55:37.342
Or to protect you.

55:38.134 --> 55:39.434
Do you have a light?

55:40.708 --> 55:42.908
That woman was hiding something.

55:55.958 --> 55:57.058
And so are you.

55:59.908 --> 56:01.558
Really, I know nothing.

56:02.606 --> 56:04.556
I was in Paris in those days.

56:05.415 --> 56:07.131
<i>That's what the police say.</i>

56:07.708 --> 56:10.963
<i>But, an airline ticket and a
hotel reservation...</i>

56:11.063 --> 56:12.464
<i>they prove nothing</i>

56:13.170 --> 56:17.359
<i>Despite that... we trusted
the police and returned home.</i>

56:22.507 --> 56:24.770
<i>Until a few Dias later,
the news appeared</i>

56:24.870 --> 56:27.570
<i>accusing my son
of being a thief.</i>

56:34.186 --> 56:36.312
<i>We understood that
it was all a hoax.</i>

56:36.412 --> 56:40.162
<i>That was not our Daniel. In his
whole life, he had never hurt anyone.</i>

56:42.837 --> 56:44.387
<i>My wife broke down...</i>

56:44.750 --> 56:47.350
<i>when she understood what
that meant.</i>

56:50.292 --> 56:52.542
<i>But I wasn't going to stop fighting.</i>

56:54.750 --> 56:57.300
<i>I followed the one
track I had left.</i>

56:58.792 --> 56:59.492
<i>You.</i>

57:02.000 --> 57:05.550
<i>And I found out everything that you
might lose by a mishap.</i>

57:08.015 --> 57:11.803
<i>What would it mean to you to
admit that you were not in Paris,</i>

57:11.903 --> 57:13.503
<i>but with another woman instead.</i>

57:16.062 --> 57:19.762
<i>I went back to tell the police, but
they didn't believe me.</i>

57:20.675 --> 57:23.045
<i>That's when I realized
the power you have.</i>

57:24.488 --> 57:27.521
<i>The power that makes a wolf
stronger than it is.</i>

57:27.621 --> 57:30.021
But I'm not afraid of wolves like you.

57:31.924 --> 57:35.317
When you live through the most horrible
experience as a father,

57:35.417 --> 57:36.858
that they take away your son,

57:36.958 --> 57:39.908
that he disappears without
anybody caring,

57:40.167 --> 57:41.917
fear no longer exists.

57:43.000 --> 57:44.650
There's nothing.

57:47.151 --> 57:50.101
Soon they'll find out that I am
an intruder.

57:51.250 --> 57:53.150
So tell me the truth...

57:54.420 --> 57:55.692
where is my son?

57:58.613 --> 58:00.317
I assure you that you are confused.

58:00.417 --> 58:03.675
You were in that car with that
woman whose name is not Raquel.

58:03.775 --> 58:06.825
And you had an accident in
the place where I found her.

58:06.998 --> 58:09.584
And my son's car was also there.

58:09.684 --> 58:11.734
Was it you that got rid of the body?

58:13.721 --> 58:15.271
It was this simple.

58:32.417 --> 58:33.567
Mr. Doria?

58:34.246 --> 58:35.846
Mr. Doria, is that what happened?

58:36.667 --> 58:38.017
From father to father.

58:40.120 --> 58:43.270
My wife and I know that
our son is dead.

58:43.370 --> 58:46.215
We only want to find him so we can bury
him and may he rest in peace.

58:46.315 --> 58:47.808
- Sir, you have to come with us.
- Don't touch me.

58:47.833 --> 58:49.775
- Please.
- Don't touch me!

58:49.951 --> 58:53.301
Mr. Doria, I beg you.
Don't touch me, don't touch me!

58:53.401 --> 58:55.901
If your daughter were the one
who had disappeared,

58:56.255 --> 58:59.605
you'd want to ensure that the culprit
wouldn't get away.

58:59.958 --> 59:01.358
Son of a bitch!

59:05.163 --> 59:06.213
Do you know him?

59:07.167 --> 59:08.367
If I know him?

59:15.060 --> 59:16.110
Let's go inside?

59:24.563 --> 59:25.563
Address?

59:26.001 --> 59:29.181
Calle San Ramon... 5, Bierge.

59:30.584 --> 59:32.334
<i>No one connected him to me.</i>

59:32.697 --> 59:34.947
- Phone?
<i>- Not even him.</i>

59:36.777 --> 59:39.477
<i>He knew he'd only
complicate things.</i>

59:40.484 --> 59:43.477
<i>And Felix had already been able
to exclude my name from the case.</i>

59:43.577 --> 59:45.877
- The city, you said?
- Bierge.

59:57.771 --> 01:00:01.171
<i>He went home barely able
to take care of his wife.</i>

01:00:08.234 --> 01:00:10.234
<i>And then, all that disappeared.</i>

01:00:11.917 --> 01:00:14.017
And I never heard from him again.

01:00:17.417 --> 01:00:18.167
OK.

01:00:19.667 --> 01:00:22.617
By now, we have all the pieces
on the board.

01:00:23.101 --> 01:00:24.992
<i>Two dead and two bodies.</i>

01:00:25.934 --> 01:00:28.775
The murder of your mistress
seems to be a direct consequence

01:00:28.875 --> 01:00:30.875
<i>of Daniel Garrido's death.</i>

01:00:32.242 --> 01:00:34.621
<i>But, for the police, there
is only one murder</i>

01:00:34.721 --> 01:00:36.471
'cause they only have just one body.

01:00:36.875 --> 01:00:38.459
Laura Vidal's.

01:00:38.559 --> 01:00:40.459
<i>And their suspect is you.</i>

01:00:41.071 --> 01:00:42.171
<i>But, for us,</i>

01:00:42.660 --> 01:00:44.960
<i>and for Daniel Garrido's parents</i>

01:00:45.208 --> 01:00:47.375
there is another body
and another death,

01:00:47.475 --> 01:00:49.425
that of the missing boy.

01:00:50.167 --> 01:00:53.967
<i>And the Garridos suspect that you
and your lover are the culprits.</i>

01:00:54.675 --> 01:00:57.575
Because she's now dead, the
only one that remains...

01:00:59.183 --> 01:00:59.883
is you.

01:01:02.417 --> 01:01:04.517
What does this puzzle suggests?

01:01:06.484 --> 01:01:07.644
What does it suggests to you?

01:01:07.869 --> 01:01:10.969
It makes me think of the
hotel room mystery.

01:01:11.625 --> 01:01:13.325
In that man who you say...

01:01:14.208 --> 01:01:18.343
killed your lover and then
disappeared... like magic.

01:01:19.319 --> 01:01:21.669
Someone connected to Daniel Garrido.

01:01:24.113 --> 01:01:27.463
There's someone that you have not named
who knows more than those parents.

01:01:29.075 --> 01:01:30.325
Do you need help?

01:01:30.701 --> 01:01:34.267
Do you want to have the jury believe that
passerby driver arranged the meeting at the hotel?

01:01:34.367 --> 01:01:37.885
- To what end, Mr. Doria?
- To blackmail us for what he knew.

01:01:37.985 --> 01:01:39.585
That we were guilty.

01:01:40.149 --> 01:01:42.645
And that he couldn't find out who I was
and that Laura was not my wife.

01:01:42.670 --> 01:01:44.320
Details, Mr. Doria.

01:01:44.542 --> 01:01:47.625
I have to warn you that the jury would
only believe this absurd theory,

01:01:47.725 --> 01:01:49.715
if the details make it plausible.

01:01:49.815 --> 01:01:53.865
I have not yet told you how they arranged
the appointment at the Bellavista Hotel.

01:01:54.917 --> 01:01:57.517
Mr. Doria, this has arrived for you.

01:02:03.417 --> 01:02:05.117
<i>Sender - Daniel Garrido</i>

01:02:14.318 --> 01:02:16.718
<i>I know what you've done
with your girlfriend.</i>

01:02:17.208 --> 01:02:20.008
<i>The price for my silence
is 100,000 euros.</i>

01:02:20.590 --> 01:02:23.740
<i>In small small, unmarked bills.</i>

01:02:23.962 --> 01:02:28.311
<i>If I don't get it today I will get
this photo to the police,</i>

01:02:28.708 --> 01:02:30.908
<i>so they can find Daniel Garrido.</i>

01:02:36.796 --> 01:02:38.146
<i>At 5 o'clock sharp,</i>

01:02:38.767 --> 01:02:42.917
<i>both of you go to the Bierge railway
station.</i>

01:02:43.844 --> 01:02:45.094
<i>Be on time.</i>

01:02:45.722 --> 01:02:47.817
<i>I'll call the phone booth
in the parking lot</i>

01:02:47.917 --> 01:02:50.617
<i>and I'll tell you where
to deliver the money.</i>

01:02:50.833 --> 01:02:53.233
<i>Don't come alone, or
without the money.</i>

01:02:53.375 --> 01:02:56.622
<i>And don't try anything...
or I will call the police.</i>

01:02:58.645 --> 01:03:01.745
The envelope was sent from
Bierge, three days ago.

01:03:02.784 --> 01:03:05.284
And the sender is marked
Daniel Garrido.

01:03:07.560 --> 01:03:10.360
- It was here...
- If it is not, it looks very similar, yes.

01:03:13.208 --> 01:03:15.997
Mr. Doria...
did you observe the moon?

01:03:20.596 --> 01:03:22.896
Tonight, there's a huge full moon.

01:03:25.064 --> 01:03:28.204
As huge as the hole in your story.

01:03:28.304 --> 01:03:29.832
How do you know if you don't
let me finish?

01:03:29.857 --> 01:03:32.138
How do explain that the passerby driver
would know about the swamp?

01:03:32.167 --> 01:03:35.267
The sound I heard
before the car sank.

01:03:36.375 --> 01:03:38.675
<i>Tell me, what about if it wasn't
just a deer?</i>

01:03:40.122 --> 01:03:42.900
If Laura did not get him to believe
that the incident was between us?

01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:45.067
I'm glad it was nothing.

01:03:45.167 --> 01:03:46.017
Thank you.

01:03:48.014 --> 01:03:50.134
Maybe he saw something
suspicious about our behaviour,

01:03:50.173 --> 01:03:52.673
and that he pretended to leave,
and then hide.

01:03:52.954 --> 01:03:55.104
Sure, I understand your problem.

01:03:55.413 --> 01:03:59.008
You are trying to deflect your story
from Daniel Garrido's death.

01:03:59.287 --> 01:04:01.527
- Sorry?
- The passerby driver is one who acts only for the money.

01:04:01.667 --> 01:04:04.546
And you think that if you hide
behind that blackmailer,

01:04:04.797 --> 01:04:08.079
no one will think about the poor boy,
and you'd look less guilty.

01:04:08.179 --> 01:04:10.429
Tell me, do you
have a better idea?

01:04:10.854 --> 01:04:12.317
I'll ask you three questions.

01:04:12.417 --> 01:04:16.923
If you only responds to just one we will
continue with his absurd theory of yours.

01:04:17.907 --> 01:04:18.607
One.

01:04:19.022 --> 01:04:22.091
What is the sense of the incriminating
message that you received on your cellphone?

01:04:21.596 --> 01:04:23.424
<i>I'll tell you everything. Room 715.
Hotel Bellavista</i>

01:04:22.261 --> 01:04:25.939
Two: why did the murderer not take
the money if that was his purpose?

01:04:26.039 --> 01:04:30.906
And three: how could he get in and out
of the room as if he were a ghost?

01:04:34.107 --> 01:04:34.857
Do you see?

01:04:35.250 --> 01:04:37.890
You're giving the
prosecutor exactly what he wants.

01:04:37.990 --> 01:04:41.190
Stupid connections that
will destroy the illusion

01:04:41.351 --> 01:04:43.400
that you're making a
coherent account...

01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.700
Don't start over with that!

01:04:47.880 --> 01:04:50.123
Surprise me with something,
resolve this puzzle.

01:04:50.223 --> 01:04:53.863
OK, I'll tell what might have
happened, according to what you told me.

01:04:53.963 --> 01:04:56.076
- Please.
- Let's go back to the station,

01:04:56.176 --> 01:04:59.375
where the blackmailer
had to contact you at 17:00 hours.

01:05:04.460 --> 01:05:06.360
It's 5 o' clock. It must be him.

01:05:08.013 --> 01:05:10.413
It'd be better if we are not
seen together.

01:05:22.912 --> 01:05:23.612
Yes?

01:05:23.802 --> 01:05:26.102
<i>I'll be waiting for you
at the Hotel Bellavista.</i>

01:05:26.792 --> 01:05:30.842
<i>There is only access by cog train
that goes around the valley.</i>

01:05:31.750 --> 01:05:35.835
<i>I booked room 715.</i>

01:05:37.819 --> 01:05:40.637
<i>Another thing, leave your
cell phone in the trash,</i>

01:05:40.929 --> 01:05:44.878
<i>and take the train at the
station right in front of you.</i>

01:05:45.335 --> 01:05:47.565
<i>If you don't drop your
cell phone the police</i>

01:05:47.665 --> 01:05:50.015
<i>will find Daniel Garrido's body.</i>

01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:36.000
I'm going to ask.
Wait here a moment, okay?

01:06:42.781 --> 01:06:44.681
- Good afternoon.
- Good afternoon.

01:06:45.082 --> 01:06:48.389
I have a reservation.
Room 715, please.

01:06:50.575 --> 01:06:52.805
Yes. In the name of Adrian Doria?

01:06:54.415 --> 01:06:57.915
Please, fill out the card.
I'll give you the key at once.

01:07:55.852 --> 01:07:57.402
Did anyone see you?

01:07:58.565 --> 01:08:00.215
He left instructions?

01:08:01.061 --> 01:08:02.511
We have to wait.

01:08:07.721 --> 01:08:08.671
What's up'?

01:08:08.958 --> 01:08:11.808
He just sent a text message
from your mobile phone.

01:08:13.314 --> 01:08:15.614
- It's a trap.
- We're leaving.

01:08:29.041 --> 01:08:29.890
Adrian?

01:08:34.081 --> 01:08:35.788
No, no, no!
No, no!

01:08:36.028 --> 01:08:36.678
No!

01:08:37.792 --> 01:08:40.129
I don't know where.
Really, it wasn't me!

01:08:40.229 --> 01:08:42.529
It wasn't me, I don't
know where is'...

01:08:53.897 --> 01:08:54.897
A moment.

01:08:55.658 --> 01:08:56.759
A moment...

01:08:57.263 --> 01:08:59.983
Do you suspect Tomas Garrido
was the one in the room?

01:09:00.082 --> 01:09:00.983
You don't agree?

01:09:01.515 --> 01:09:04.233
It's a likely scenario
to build your defense.

01:09:04.332 --> 01:09:06.283
It's something that would
convince a judge.

01:09:06.809 --> 01:09:10.408
Tomas Garrido had a strong
motive to commit a murder.

01:09:12.778 --> 01:09:14.728
If a father knows that the police

01:09:14.845 --> 01:09:17.858
protects those responsible for
the disappearance of his son,

01:09:17.957 --> 01:09:19.658
he has only one option:

01:09:19.894 --> 01:09:22.429
- force you to face it.
- Kill one of us

01:09:22.529 --> 01:09:24.733
<i>and incriminate the other it's
a way to get it.</i>

01:09:24.832 --> 01:09:27.733
<i>That's right. It
worked perfectly.</i>

01:09:28.203 --> 01:09:30.774
<i>Everyone believes you guilty, Mr.
Doria.</i>

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:34.274
<i>The police, your own wife and
even your financial partners.</i>

01:09:34.625 --> 01:09:38.036
<i>Tomas Garrido did not only implicate
you for the death of your lover,</i>

01:09:38.136 --> 01:09:40.442
<i>but he also ruined your
life and your business.</i>

01:09:40.542 --> 01:09:44.142
<i>And only Felix could get you
out with a million dollar bail.</i>

01:09:44.826 --> 01:09:46.733
<i>Together, they created
the conspiracy theory.</i>

01:09:46.832 --> 01:09:49.604
<i>And I suspect he came
to see me and then hire me</i>

01:09:49.886 --> 01:09:52.237
<i>because he wasn't capable
of handling it himself.</i>

01:09:52.341 --> 01:09:55.964
<i>His lawyer knew that if you
convinced me with your story,</i>

01:09:56.064 --> 01:09:57.964
<i>I would have convinced a jury.</i>

01:09:58.125 --> 01:10:01.178
<i>Did you hire someone to tell me
what to say at trial, Felix?</i>

01:10:01.278 --> 01:10:03.733
<i>She's the best witness
coach around.</i>

01:10:03.833 --> 01:10:07.483
<i>Two weeks ago, she was about to retire,
but she took this as her last case.</i>

01:10:07.583 --> 01:10:10.633
And I guarantee you she's
not going to lose.

01:10:11.083 --> 01:10:11.933
Now then,

01:10:12.233 --> 01:10:15.672
the only way you have to prove
you didn't kill your mistress,

01:10:15.772 --> 01:10:17.622
is to implicate Tomas Garrido.

01:10:17.976 --> 01:10:21.676
And that means confessing what
you did to his son.

01:10:25.222 --> 01:10:29.372
Yes, but that's useless without explaining
how he got out of the room without a trace.

01:10:29.790 --> 01:10:32.650
<i>I assure you that when I
woke up, there was no one in the room.</i>

01:10:32.750 --> 01:10:33.550
Help!

01:10:34.234 --> 01:10:35.134
Police!

01:10:36.792 --> 01:10:40.692
Are you familiar with the concept
of lateral thinking, Mr. Doria?

01:10:42.333 --> 01:10:44.802
It consists in the technique
of changing the perspective

01:10:44.902 --> 01:10:47.352
from which events are analyzed.

01:10:47.750 --> 01:10:48.800
For example...

01:10:49.378 --> 01:10:52.078
in a timber barn which is completely
empty

01:10:52.333 --> 01:10:55.883
a man is found hanging in the
center of the carrier beam.

01:10:56.992 --> 01:10:59.734
The rope, with which he hanged
himself is three meters long

01:10:59.834 --> 01:11:02.417
and his feet hang 30 centimeters
above the ground.

01:11:03.833 --> 01:11:06.520
The closest wall is 6 meters away.

01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:10.317
It's not possible to climb on
the wall, or on the beam.

01:11:10.417 --> 01:11:12.650
Yet, the man hanged himself.

01:11:14.205 --> 01:11:15.405
How did he do it?

01:11:17.588 --> 01:11:21.038
He climbed on a block of ice which
gradually melted in the heat.

01:11:22.105 --> 01:11:24.005
This is our barn.

01:11:27.146 --> 01:11:30.246
The police's photographic archive of
your case.

01:11:34.628 --> 01:11:38.545
And the answer must be in
the statement of the facts.

01:11:44.410 --> 01:11:48.060
- I don't know what you expect to see.
- The details, Mr. Doria.

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:50.271
You dwell on the details.

01:11:51.623 --> 01:11:53.193
They have always been
under our noses.

01:11:53.194 --> 01:11:54.581
<i>Adrian Doria arrested for murder</i>

01:11:54.625 --> 01:11:58.004
But they have to be analyzed
from a different perspective.

01:12:00.902 --> 01:12:04.602
What if the answer to the enigma
had never been inside the room,

01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:07.108
but rather, outside?

01:12:07.208 --> 01:12:10.733
Now, he works near Bierge, in the
valley, 20 minutes from home.

01:12:10.833 --> 01:12:13.733
It was no accident that he
chose a hotel so isolated.

01:12:13.833 --> 01:12:16.133
Tomas Garrido set up
a trap for you.

01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:20.750
<i>He must have sent
the package to him,</i>

01:12:21.625 --> 01:12:25.375
<i>so that you mistakenly assembled
the pieces of your puzzle,</i>

01:12:25.625 --> 01:12:28.666
<i>Making it so you'd doubt
what actually happened'</i>

01:12:28.766 --> 01:12:30.798
<i>Because he knew that this way</i>

01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:33.250
<i>he would find the missing piece.</i>

01:12:34.833 --> 01:12:35.533
<i>Yes?</i>

01:12:36.191 --> 01:12:38.367
I look forward to seeing you at the
Hotel Bellavista.

01:12:38.467 --> 01:12:40.496
It makes no sense, he
couldn't have known about the swamp.

01:12:40.521 --> 01:12:43.525
The area where you buried the lad
is full of swampy lakes.

01:12:43.625 --> 01:12:45.508
And the locals know it.

01:12:45.608 --> 01:12:49.330
For Tomas Garrido, it was
enough to toss a coin in the air

01:12:49.994 --> 01:12:52.094
and wait for you to pick it up.

01:12:55.292 --> 01:12:56.492
<i>And you did.</i>

01:12:57.187 --> 01:12:59.744
<i>- Is that what happened?
- You gave yourself up,</i>

01:13:00.897 --> 01:13:03.197
and, at the right time,
you handed Laura over.

01:14:36.420 --> 01:14:38.131
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:14:38.231 --> 01:14:40.301
I have a reservation.
Room 715...

01:14:40.401 --> 01:14:42.024
That's how Tomas Garrido

01:14:42.124 --> 01:14:45.358
could get in the room without
leaving any evidence.

01:14:45.458 --> 01:14:49.838
He just had to wait for you and
Laura to get up to the room.

01:14:50.110 --> 01:14:53.210
<i>From there, he could send
the SMS with Laura's phone.</i>

01:14:53.917 --> 01:14:56.858
He just sent us a text message
with your mobile phone.

01:14:56.958 --> 01:15:00.008
<i>And then hit you to
put you out of action</i>

01:15:02.784 --> 01:15:05.284
completing the perfect crime.

01:15:07.667 --> 01:15:08.662
If this was the case,

01:15:08.762 --> 01:15:12.446
Tomas Garrido had set up the
stage for blaming you

01:15:12.546 --> 01:15:15.746
and disappear through the road
that his wife had indicated.

01:15:16.565 --> 01:15:18.765
<i>He left the money
to incriminate you.</i>

01:15:19.067 --> 01:15:21.667
<i>Left Laura's phone in the room</i>

01:15:23.030 --> 01:15:26.980
<i>and made sure that your fingerprints
were on the murder weapon.</i>

01:15:39.438 --> 01:15:40.238
Hello.

01:15:40.972 --> 01:15:42.022
Is everything all right?

01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:45.750
Well, nobody left the room.

01:15:51.083 --> 01:15:52.283
Hello?

01:16:25.047 --> 01:16:26.733
- Good evening.
- Good evening.

01:16:26.833 --> 01:16:30.472
- Where did the noises come from?
- In a suite, the 715.

01:16:55.375 --> 01:16:58.075
Stand back.
Stand back, please!

01:17:03.789 --> 01:17:04.689
Police!

01:17:05.531 --> 01:17:06.731
Open the door.

01:17:23.373 --> 01:17:24.473
Everybody out!

01:17:28.336 --> 01:17:29.932
Bring forensics.

01:17:30.032 --> 01:17:33.175
Guys, we have to call the forensics.
We found a body.

01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:48.169
<i>The boy's mother was the reason
why they sent us to that hotel.</i>

01:17:48.269 --> 01:17:51.092
<i>All she had to do was make her
husband disappear from the room</i>

01:17:51.192 --> 01:17:53.442
<i>to implicate me as the guilty one.</i>

01:17:54.086 --> 01:17:56.600
<i>The police never connected
her to you</i>

01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:00.400
<i>because Felix did away with
your name in her son's case.</i>

01:18:02.214 --> 01:18:03.164
Excuse me.

01:18:07.445 --> 01:18:08.245
Tell me.

01:18:10.206 --> 01:18:11.256
Confirmed?

01:18:12.845 --> 01:18:14.245
One hundred percent?

01:18:15.922 --> 01:18:17.672
OK. Thank you.

01:18:18.783 --> 01:18:20.533
Is it about the prosecution witness?

01:18:20.665 --> 01:18:23.865
We don't yet know the
name, but we know who he is.

01:18:24.327 --> 01:18:25.627
The passerby driver.

01:18:26.594 --> 01:18:30.026
- It forces us to think fast.
- It also means that I'm fucked.

01:18:30.126 --> 01:18:32.226
Not entirely, if you obey me.

01:18:32.792 --> 01:18:35.393
Suppose that you did not stay
at the cottage with your lover

01:18:35.493 --> 01:18:37.047
the day of the incident.

01:18:37.147 --> 01:18:39.525
You were in Paris, as per your alibi.

01:18:39.625 --> 01:18:42.549
It was Laura who rented the place.
Her name is on record.

01:18:45.997 --> 01:18:48.545
<i>So you were not present</i>

01:18:48.778 --> 01:18:51.109
<i>when the accident that
killed Daniel Garrido took place.</i>

01:18:51.209 --> 01:18:52.009
Hey...

01:18:53.308 --> 01:18:56.079
The license plates and other
evidence is circumstantial

01:18:56.179 --> 01:18:58.949
and, of course, it was Laura
to put the plan into action

01:18:59.049 --> 01:19:02.425
<i>by faking the boy's escape
for embezzlement.</i>

01:19:05.177 --> 01:19:06.876
<i>We have to convince the judge</i>

01:19:06.976 --> 01:19:09.559
<i>that you were just another one
of Laura's victim,</i>

01:19:09.659 --> 01:19:13.233
<i>and that you ended up in that hotel
room because she asked for your help.</i>

01:19:13.333 --> 01:19:16.475
<i>It could be you might not have known anything
about Daniel Garrido until that moment,</i>

01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:19.650
<i>while the father unjustly
accuse you of the disappearance.</i>

01:19:19.750 --> 01:19:22.450
You want to turn me into Laura's victim?

01:19:22.871 --> 01:19:24.821
The only piece missing

01:19:25.576 --> 01:19:28.503
is to connect her directly
with Daniel's body.

01:19:28.603 --> 01:19:30.803
And tell me something...
how do you plan to do it?

01:19:32.011 --> 01:19:35.561
We have to hide something of Laura's
in the boy's car.

01:19:35.815 --> 01:19:39.991
We have to incriminate her of
Daniel's disappearance.

01:19:43.419 --> 01:19:44.819
Your only crime

01:19:45.261 --> 01:19:48.561
is aiding and abetting due to
a guilty conscience.

01:19:59.829 --> 01:20:01.479
Where did you sink the car?

01:20:04.333 --> 01:20:06.598
We'll give the location of the
body anonymously.

01:20:06.698 --> 01:20:08.548
You won't have to admit anything.

01:20:08.698 --> 01:20:11.067
But, without a body there
is no crime and without a crime...

01:20:11.167 --> 01:20:14.139
there is no way to persuade a
jury that Laura's murder

01:20:14.239 --> 01:20:16.358
was not a crime of passion.

01:20:16.458 --> 01:20:18.684
We will stay to the true facts
just close enough,

01:20:18.784 --> 01:20:20.534
so you don't get burned.

01:20:20.917 --> 01:20:25.117
How could I not get burned if the
prosecution holds the most important card?

01:20:25.362 --> 01:20:26.692
- Hello.
- Hello.

01:20:26.792 --> 01:20:29.594
<i>The passerby driver will place me
at the scene of the accident.</i>

01:20:28.468 --> 01:20:29.692
Do you need help?

01:20:29.693 --> 01:20:31.613
Felix has been looking for
him to neutralize him.

01:20:31.699 --> 01:20:33.599
The prosecution has no witness.

01:20:34.893 --> 01:20:37.643
- What are you saying?
- Nobody has met with the judge.

01:20:38.041 --> 01:20:40.713
It was my invention, which I
gradually shaped,

01:20:40.813 --> 01:20:43.013
with the details you gave me.

01:20:43.914 --> 01:20:45.150
You've been leading me on?

01:20:45.250 --> 01:20:48.400
Why didn't you tell me the truth
from the beginning?

01:20:52.061 --> 01:20:55.961
To see if it was possible to get rid
of Tomas Garrido from the room.

01:20:58.795 --> 01:21:01.445
I've always known that
he was the culprit.

01:21:04.071 --> 01:21:07.821
It was also easy to discover that
his wife worked at the hotel.

01:21:09.750 --> 01:21:12.026
And did you wait for me to tell you?

01:21:12.126 --> 01:21:15.020
To make sure that I could
put my life in your hands,

01:21:15.120 --> 01:21:16.420
Ms. Goodman.

01:21:21.049 --> 01:21:22.699
Where did you put it?

01:21:31.401 --> 01:21:32.901
This is where I sunk it.

01:21:56.150 --> 01:21:57.750
I have to tell you something else.

01:22:12.122 --> 01:22:14.572
We thought he had died, I swear.

01:22:20.933 --> 01:22:23.400
Laura had taken things too far and
there was no going back.

01:22:23.500 --> 01:22:26.733
If the police found the body
the autopsy would give me away.

01:22:26.833 --> 01:22:30.233
I had to be sure that you
would help me avoid it.

01:22:31.710 --> 01:22:33.810
It's my job to keep you out of jail,

01:22:33.910 --> 01:22:37.710
but I'm not going to save who
you really are, a scum, Mr. Doria.

01:22:37.810 --> 01:22:39.780
And you're have to swallow
what I say to you because...

01:22:39.805 --> 01:22:43.655
The boy was dead without being dead.
I had to decide in an instant.

01:22:45.268 --> 01:22:48.982
Don't lie to yourself.
You're a murderer!

01:22:49.082 --> 01:22:51.246
You're testing me again, right?

01:22:51.346 --> 01:22:53.517
So I can learn to withstand the
prosecution's attacks, right?

01:22:53.542 --> 01:22:55.577
What you told me
changes everything.

01:22:55.677 --> 01:22:57.327
Now, you are in my hands.

01:22:58.463 --> 01:23:02.968
If I get to the judge with what you
told me, you are lost!

01:23:03.068 --> 01:23:04.318
You can't do that!

01:23:06.733 --> 01:23:08.383
You hear me? You can't do that.

01:23:08.498 --> 01:23:11.297
That's what the prosecutor
is looking for.

01:23:11.397 --> 01:23:12.897
Your desperation.

01:23:13.099 --> 01:23:15.817
And look how easy it was
to provoke it.

01:23:15.917 --> 01:23:17.835
Do you want to insult me?
Go ahead.

01:23:18.417 --> 01:23:22.900
That's also what the prosecutor is looking for.
That the arrogant idiot that is inside comes out.

01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:23.800
Enough!

01:23:27.087 --> 01:23:29.087
Are you are not here to defend me?

01:23:31.184 --> 01:23:32.634
Then, do it.

01:23:52.814 --> 01:23:56.764
I will not let your case from
staining my record, on the last day.

01:23:58.636 --> 01:24:01.542
From now on, we'll do things my way.

01:24:02.287 --> 01:24:05.424
So, I must be certain that there
are no loose ends in your story.

01:24:05.524 --> 01:24:06.809
- There are none.
- No?

01:24:06.909 --> 01:24:09.259
Because I think you are still
trying to manipulate me.

01:24:09.583 --> 01:24:12.016
Testing on me your distorted
version of the facts,

01:24:12.116 --> 01:24:14.556
- like I was your puppet.
- What is it that you don't believe?

01:24:14.583 --> 01:24:17.430
It's true that everything could
have happened as you said.

01:24:17.530 --> 01:24:22.025
But... what if it wasn't you that broke
the promise never to meet again,

01:24:22.272 --> 01:24:23.275
but rather Laura?

01:24:23.375 --> 01:24:26.754
Can I know what you did to cause the police
to believe that Daniel has run away?

01:24:26.854 --> 01:24:28.364
Come in 4 hours at the bar,

01:24:28.464 --> 01:24:30.398
<i>- in front of the scrap yard.</i>
- All right.

01:24:30.498 --> 01:24:32.733
<i>- Don't be late.</i>
- All right. I'll be there.

01:24:32.833 --> 01:24:35.648
<i>Withdrawal of small amounts
from the customers' accounts,</i>

01:24:35.748 --> 01:24:37.498
<i>shortly before disappearing.</i>

01:24:38.875 --> 01:24:41.825
<i>You also could have gotten a
hold of the lad's things.</i>

01:24:42.333 --> 01:24:44.283
Adrian, what does all of this mean?

01:24:44.647 --> 01:24:46.097
The lad's wallet.

01:24:47.135 --> 01:24:50.235
I took it before I stuffed
him into the trunk.

01:24:51.062 --> 01:24:54.517
- Set a price. Thank you.
<i>- You've always had the means and contacts,</i>

01:24:54.617 --> 01:24:56.638
to change the course of events,

01:24:56.738 --> 01:24:59.785
<i>- without leaving tell-tale tracks.</i>
- I'll take care of it.

01:25:00.223 --> 01:25:01.173
That's false.

01:25:02.099 --> 01:25:04.692
- You can't prove it.
- Neither can you.

01:25:04.792 --> 01:25:06.692
Let's see everything in reverse.

01:25:08.116 --> 01:25:08.718
Hey?

01:25:08.818 --> 01:25:10.514
<i>Would the pieces fit,</i>

01:25:10.614 --> 01:25:13.678
<i>if it was you who took
the initiative?</i>

01:25:13.875 --> 01:25:15.715
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling the police.

01:25:15.789 --> 01:25:19.027
Listen, it wasn't our fault,
it was the fucking deer.

01:25:19.127 --> 01:25:20.327
Are you crazy?

01:25:21.707 --> 01:25:24.068
- What if he saw something?
- He hasn't seen anything.

01:25:24.168 --> 01:25:25.668
We have to rid of him.

01:25:28.750 --> 01:25:30.954
<i>And if it was Laura
Vidal who was dragged to</i>

01:25:31.054 --> 01:25:33.704
<i>an extreme situation
out of control?</i>

01:25:36.313 --> 01:25:38.363
According to this medical report,

01:25:38.501 --> 01:25:41.415
your mistress suffered from
severe anxiety attacks,

01:25:41.515 --> 01:25:44.565
<i>after your return from your
alleged trip to Paris.</i>

01:25:45.333 --> 01:25:48.158
<i>Even a ruthless person like
her could collapse.</i>

01:25:48.258 --> 01:25:51.308
That's precisely what it does not
agree with me, Mr. Doria.

01:25:51.901 --> 01:25:53.826
That she had been the real instigator
of everything,

01:25:53.851 --> 01:25:56.567
it would strengthen the belief
that you would save that youngster.

01:25:56.667 --> 01:25:58.567
Instead, you drowned him!

01:26:02.402 --> 01:26:04.903
<i>Parents fear it is not a
voluntary disappearance</i>

01:26:07.128 --> 01:26:10.228
<i>It was she that bore such a weight
on her conscience,</i>

01:26:12.889 --> 01:26:15.189
<i>that, little by little,
made her collapse.</i>

01:26:22.383 --> 01:26:25.783
<i>The impresario Adrian Doria has
just received the prize...</i>

01:26:28.493 --> 01:26:32.297
<i>Until she realized that there was only
one way to regain their dignity'.</i>

01:26:38.210 --> 01:26:41.257
<i>By now, she could no longer return
the child to those poor parents.</i>

01:26:42.073 --> 01:26:43.733
There was my friend and...

01:26:43.833 --> 01:26:46.133
<i>But there was
something she could do.</i>

01:26:47.372 --> 01:26:48.922
<i>Tell them the truth.</i>

01:26:53.027 --> 01:26:53.977
Daniel...

01:26:55.248 --> 01:26:59.022
<i>So she met them at the hotel
where the lad's mother was employed.</i>

01:26:59.122 --> 01:27:02.472
<i>A secluded spot in which
to put her plan in action.</i>

01:27:03.250 --> 01:27:06.300
<i>She went to Bierge alone
through the valley.</i>

01:27:08.550 --> 01:27:11.300
<i>And when she got to the
hotel station,</i>

01:27:11.856 --> 01:27:15.706
<i>She call you from a pay phone
so you wouldn't suspect anything.</i>

01:27:18.663 --> 01:27:20.192
Someone knows something.

01:27:20.292 --> 01:27:23.654
<i>She made you believe that the
passerby driver had seen something.</i>

01:27:23.754 --> 01:27:25.329
...then why the fuck are you
using the phone?

01:27:25.354 --> 01:27:28.154
<i>That he had found her and
was blackmailing her.</i>

01:27:29.228 --> 01:27:33.378
<i>It was her way of trying to compensate
those poor people for their loss.</i>

01:27:33.834 --> 01:27:37.284
<i>She didn't have the courage to
confess it all empty-handed.</i>

01:27:38.750 --> 01:27:41.650
<i>Once in the room, all she
had to do is wait.</i>

01:27:42.526 --> 01:27:45.178
<i>Then she set in motion the
second part of the plan.</i>

01:27:45.502 --> 01:27:49.152
<i>She wrote a text message on her
cell phone as a protection measure.</i>

01:27:51.610 --> 01:27:54.360
<i>Laura knew you would refuse
to confess.</i>

01:27:54.917 --> 01:27:58.049
<i>Because you only care about
one thing: yourself.</i>

01:28:03.667 --> 01:28:07.717
<i>So you made sure that nobody would see you
getting into the room where Laura was waiting.</i>

01:28:15.723 --> 01:28:19.123
<i>But Laura had already
reached the point of no return.</i>

01:28:20.062 --> 01:28:23.107
<i>When she told you what she intended
to do, you lost control</i>

01:28:23.207 --> 01:28:24.857
Read your message.

01:28:31.590 --> 01:28:33.779
<i>And when you received
the programmed SMS,</i>

01:28:33.879 --> 01:28:36.299
<i>you understood you had fallen
into her trap.</i>

01:28:46.335 --> 01:28:48.685
The reservation is also in your name.

01:28:50.850 --> 01:28:52.400
Let's give them the money.

01:28:53.792 --> 01:28:55.864
You're going to tell them where
their son's body is

01:28:55.964 --> 01:28:57.464
and we're going to surrender...

01:28:58.288 --> 01:28:59.138
Adrian.

01:29:01.621 --> 01:29:03.221
There's no going back.

01:29:25.598 --> 01:29:26.798
I didn't kill her

01:29:27.251 --> 01:29:31.022
and I'll never admit to it in front
of a jury, do you understand?

01:29:31.122 --> 01:29:35.122
You killed and became trapped in
a room where it was not possible to escape.

01:29:38.218 --> 01:29:40.452
Hello?
Is everything alright?

01:29:51.833 --> 01:29:54.983
<i>You thought the SMS could be useful,</i>

01:29:55.625 --> 01:29:59.375
<i>And you looked for the elements on which
to base your convoluted theory.</i>

01:30:06.585 --> 01:30:07.485
Police!

01:30:10.516 --> 01:30:11.566
You look fine?

01:30:15.028 --> 01:30:15.928
Police!

01:30:19.208 --> 01:30:19.958
Good.

01:30:20.808 --> 01:30:22.058
Do you want to play?

01:30:22.631 --> 01:30:23.681
Let's do it.

01:30:24.870 --> 01:30:27.358
Why did Tomas Garrido and
his wife have not spoken up?

01:30:27.601 --> 01:30:30.977
If Laura call them to tell the truth
Why did they not tell the police?

01:30:31.077 --> 01:30:32.757
Those parents know you

01:30:32.857 --> 01:30:36.067
will never incriminated yourself
and tell them where their son is buried.

01:30:36.167 --> 01:30:39.586
Without a body, it is very
difficult to prove a murder,

01:30:39.686 --> 01:30:43.817
and that you're capable of
anything just to remain free,

01:30:44.958 --> 01:30:47.758
including blaming them for the
death of your mistress.

01:30:49.674 --> 01:30:50.824
Come with me.

01:31:02.998 --> 01:31:05.848
Second window to the right of the
penultimate floor.

01:31:07.564 --> 01:31:09.932
Look carefully, Mr. Doria.

01:31:16.135 --> 01:31:19.335
Tomas Garrido has stopped counting
on the police for some time now.

01:31:19.553 --> 01:31:24.101
And, since then, he's been watching you
planning take the law into his own hands.

01:31:35.773 --> 01:31:37.498
You assume things that you can not know.

01:31:37.598 --> 01:31:39.438
About Tomas Garrido I know more
than you think.

01:31:39.500 --> 01:31:40.400
Why?

01:31:40.809 --> 01:31:44.159
- You're very smart, make an effort.
- I want an answer.

01:31:45.715 --> 01:31:48.155
<i>When Tomas and his wife
arrived at the hotel</i>

01:31:48.255 --> 01:31:50.314
<i>they learned of Laura's death.</i>

01:31:50.414 --> 01:31:52.214
<i>they realized what had happened.</i>

01:31:53.221 --> 01:31:56.980
<i>Of course, they examined the options
and hesitated about what to do.</i>

01:31:57.080 --> 01:31:59.421
<i>But, not trusting in the
justice system, what did they have left?</i>

01:31:59.446 --> 01:32:01.546
Study the enemy and wait.

01:32:02.125 --> 01:32:04.375
To watch you.

01:32:12.125 --> 01:32:15.025
<i>Tomas Garrido became
a shadow in the shadows.</i>

01:32:20.882 --> 01:32:23.442
<i>He found an apartment
in front of your building</i>

01:32:23.542 --> 01:32:26.142
<i>and managed to occupy it
anonymously.</i>

01:32:26.562 --> 01:32:27.762
<i>And since then...</i>

01:32:28.319 --> 01:32:32.157
<i>he's kept you and anybody else that came in
contact with you under constant surveillance.</i>

01:32:32.522 --> 01:32:36.856
<i>Every meeting, every conversation,
every move to get away</i>

01:32:37.458 --> 01:32:40.008
<i>Tomas Garrido was there '
to take advantage.</i>

01:32:41.084 --> 01:32:43.261
And of course, that includes me too.

01:32:50.586 --> 01:32:54.186
<i>Who was that man and that he was
doing in front of my office?</i>

01:32:57.883 --> 01:33:01.133
<i>I realized that he had arrived there
following Felix's footsteps.</i>

01:33:01.620 --> 01:33:04.770
<i>So I arranged for surveillance to
find out his movements.</i>

01:33:05.185 --> 01:33:07.235
<i>VG - Virginia Goodman - Attorney</i>

01:33:07.862 --> 01:33:11.248
It was the boy's father that brought
you here, not the other way around.

01:33:11.348 --> 01:33:14.548
He gave you the thread to
get to Daniel Garrido.

01:33:23.492 --> 01:33:26.709
This picture shows that everything could
have happened in a way that benefits me.

01:33:26.917 --> 01:33:29.921
You're still not listening and not
paying attention to the details.

01:33:30.125 --> 01:33:31.627
The lad's mother was in the room.

01:33:31.788 --> 01:33:34.213
That day she was off work,
I just told you.

01:33:34.313 --> 01:33:36.409
They went to the hotel because they
had arranged a meeting with Laura.

01:33:36.434 --> 01:33:40.734
- I tell you that this photo shows...
- This picture is fake, Mr. Doria!

01:33:42.558 --> 01:33:44.508
And it's rigged. It's a composite.

01:33:47.742 --> 01:33:49.992
Look at the reflection
in the mirror.

01:33:56.433 --> 01:33:57.933
And now, tell me...

01:33:58.529 --> 01:33:59.979
Do you want my help?

01:34:00.566 --> 01:34:04.036
Do you want to make sure the judge believes
you're not a murderer? Well, then...

01:34:04.136 --> 01:34:06.986
- admit that you killed Laura...
- I killed her.

01:34:24.375 --> 01:34:27.114
<i>Adrian, are you there?
You have your cell phone turned off.</i>

01:34:27.657 --> 01:34:29.207
Call me as soon as you can.

01:34:30.017 --> 01:34:32.617
The miracle that we were expecting
has happened.

01:34:45.368 --> 01:34:47.568
Talk to him.
It seems important.

01:34:48.806 --> 01:34:51.656
Let's take 10 minutes rest and
then we'll resume from the beginning.

01:34:52.625 --> 01:34:54.970
I know the strategy for your defense.

01:34:55.070 --> 01:34:56.370
Rest assured.

01:34:57.373 --> 01:34:59.483
I am going out for a bit
to clear my mind.

01:34:59.583 --> 01:35:01.083
- Do you have coffee?
- Yes.

01:35:02.093 --> 01:35:04.693
We'll need it.
It will be long night.

01:35:05.208 --> 01:35:05.958
OK.

01:35:15.333 --> 01:35:16.733
Mrs. Goodman?

01:35:25.082 --> 01:35:25.932
Thank you.

01:35:54.250 --> 01:35:55.797
- Felix?
- I was looking for you.

01:35:56.000 --> 01:35:59.150
- The cell phone was turned off. What's up'?
<i>- I found him.</i>

01:35:59.461 --> 01:36:01.811
You were never on that road.

01:36:02.903 --> 01:36:04.303
Can we trust him?

01:36:09.660 --> 01:36:10.660
Totally.

01:36:16.260 --> 01:36:17.910
What about Virginia Goodman?

01:36:18.323 --> 01:36:19.923
I had to tell her everything.

01:36:20.792 --> 01:36:21.592
<i>Everything?</i>

01:36:22.507 --> 01:36:23.307
Everything.

01:36:23.719 --> 01:36:25.019
And how do you feel?

01:36:26.292 --> 01:36:27.242
You were right.

01:36:27.682 --> 01:36:28.982
She's very good.

01:36:30.524 --> 01:36:31.874
Can we trust her.

01:36:34.375 --> 01:36:38.650
Tell me, what was the matter with the prosecution?
With the plane's noise, I couldn't hear you.

01:36:38.750 --> 01:36:40.500
Nothing, nothing. Don't worry.

01:36:42.591 --> 01:36:44.091
What the hell was that?

01:36:45.875 --> 01:36:47.175
Felix, can you hear me?

01:36:55.292 --> 01:36:56.542
Adrian, are you there?

01:36:56.884 --> 01:36:58.934
Give me a moment.
I'll call you.

01:37:00.588 --> 01:37:01.488
Shit...

01:37:16.375 --> 01:37:18.469
<i>No one has met the judge.</i>

01:37:18.708 --> 01:37:20.608
The prosecution has no witnesses.

01:37:22.091 --> 01:37:24.454
It was all my invention, which I
shaped, gradually,

01:37:24.554 --> 01:37:26.470
with the details you gave me.

01:37:26.570 --> 01:37:29.858
- I tell her that this photo shows...
- This picture's fake, Mr. Doria!

01:37:29.958 --> 01:37:31.908
And it's faked. It's a composite.

01:37:32.417 --> 01:37:34.121
You presume things you can not know.

01:37:34.221 --> 01:37:36.125
On Garrido I know more
than you think.

01:37:36.225 --> 01:37:38.975
- Because'?
- You're smart, make and effort.

01:37:39.750 --> 01:37:42.316
My wife and I know that
our son is dead.

01:37:42.416 --> 01:37:45.201
We only want to find him just to bury him
and may he rest in peace.

01:37:45.301 --> 01:37:47.576
<i>But, not trusting in the
justice system, what did they have left?</i>

01:37:47.601 --> 01:37:49.628
<i>Study the enemy and wait.</i>

01:37:50.351 --> 01:37:53.251
<i>That's how we met.
In a theater group.</i>

01:37:54.833 --> 01:37:59.596
If I get to judge with what you've
told me, you'd be lost!

01:38:00.004 --> 01:38:01.650
Now you're in my hands.

01:38:02.430 --> 01:38:05.130
Adrian, are you there?
Your phone's off.

01:38:07.955 --> 01:38:09.555
Everything is under control.

01:38:13.596 --> 01:38:17.296
And the Garridos suspect that you and
you mistress are the culprits.

01:38:17.510 --> 01:38:21.338
Since she's dead, there's only...
you.

01:38:27.375 --> 01:38:29.025
Where did you sink the body?

01:38:52.621 --> 01:38:55.128
<i>There won't be no salvation
without suffering,</i>

01:38:55.833 --> 01:38:57.927
And you're not smarter than me.

01:41:02.092 --> 01:41:03.442
<i>Police, can I help you?</i>

01:41:03.718 --> 01:41:04.868
Mr. Doria?

01:41:05.000 --> 01:41:06.387
<i>My name is Tomas Garrido.</i>

01:41:06.487 --> 01:41:08.087
I'm Virginia Goodman.

01:41:08.450 --> 01:41:10.510
<i>I am the father of
Daniel Garrido.</i>

01:41:12.828 --> 01:41:16.228
I want to tell you what really
happened to my son.
