WEBVTT

00:00.100 --> 00:01.800
PREVIOUSLY ON "UGLY BETTY"

00:01.800 --> 00:03.700
I'M GONNA ENROLL
IN A WRITING CLASS.

00:03.700 --> 00:04.300
THAT'S GREAT.

00:04.300 --> 00:05.200
I'M GONNA BE A WRITER.

00:05.200 --> 00:06.200
JUST FOLLOW THE "B."?

00:06.200 --> 00:07.800
THE "B" WILL LEAD YOU TO A KISS.

00:07.800 --> 00:09.600
THE KISS WILL TAKE YOU
TO YOUR FATHER.

00:09.600 --> 00:10.700
YOU'RE MY "B."

00:11.700 --> 00:13.600
???

00:13.600 --> 00:15.800
MOTION TO TERMINATE
WILHELMINA SLATER.

00:15.800 --> 00:17.600
-ALL THOSE IN FAVOR.
-AYE.

00:17.600 --> 00:20.300
IF I CAN'T MARRY
INTO THE MEADE FAMILY,

00:20.300 --> 00:22.600
I WILL GIVE BIRTH
TO AN HEIR.

00:22.600 --> 00:25.400
ALL GNS INDICATE
THAT YOU HAVE A HOSTILE WOMB.

00:25.400 --> 00:27.400
WE NEED TO FIND
A SURROGATE WE CAN CONTROL.

00:27.400 --> 00:29.500
WE'RE ALMOST DONE.
HAVE A LOOK.

00:30.800 --> 00:32.700
SURPRISE!
SURPRISE!

00:33.200 --> 00:34.900
IT'S FOR 
YOUR NEW SALON.

00:36.200 --> 00:38.100
OH, HEY, YOU GUYS
ARE GOOD TOGETHER.

00:39.800 --> 00:42.200
YEAH. 
REALLY GOOD.

00:49.700 --> 00:53.600
BETTY, THANK YOU SO MUCH
FOR LETTING ME PRACTICE ON YOU.

00:53.600 --> 00:55.400
NOW THAT
HILDA'S BEAUTILITIES IS OPEN,

00:55.700 --> 00:58.500
I CAN'T RISK MAKING MISTAKES
ON ANY REAL CUSTOMERS.

00:58.500 --> 01:01.000
HILDA,
YOU DON'T MAKE MISTAKE--

01:05.000 --> 01:07.000
WHAT? YOU SAID
YOU WANTED PRINCESS-Y.

01:07.000 --> 01:09.000
IT'S JUST MAYBE A LITTLE
TOO REGAL FOR A NIGHTCLUB.

01:09.600 --> 01:11.000
I JUST WANTED IT
TO BE A LITTLE DIFFERENT.

01:11.100 --> 01:13.800
'S HENRY'S BAND'S FIRST GIG,
AND I WANT TO LOOK CUTE.

01:13.800 --> 01:16.000
AWW, 
I LOVE IT.

01:16.000 --> 01:17.300
YOU'RE A GROUPIE.

01:18.500 --> 01:19.600
EYES.

01:19.800 --> 01:21.500
I MEAN, TECHNICALLY,
I'M NOT A GROUPIE,

01:21.500 --> 01:24.200
BECAUSE HENRY'S NOT IN THE BAND.
HE'S THE MANAGER

01:24.200 --> 01:26.000
THE GLUE THAT HOLDS
THE BAND TOGETHER.

01:27.400 --> 01:28.600
OKAY. 
ENOUGH.

01:28.600 --> 01:32.300
YEAH, WELL, I THINK YOU OUGHT TO TELL THE GLUE 
THAT HIS BAND NAME IS STUPID.

01:32.300 --> 01:33.500
I MEAN, THE I.R.S.?

01:33.500 --> 01:35.400
IT'S FUNNY.
THEY'RE ACCOUNTANTS.

01:35.400 --> 01:37.700
THE INTERNAL RHYTHM SERVICE.
GET IT?

01:37.700 --> 01:40.000
NO.
EYES.

01:40.500 --> 01:42.100
-AUNT BETTY,
-ANOTHER LETTER.

01:42.200 --> 01:43.900
OH, GOD, NO.

01:44.100 --> 01:45.600
I MEAN, 
INTERESTING.

01:48.000 --> 01:49.600
FROM "THE NEW YORK REVIEW."

01:50.300 --> 01:54.100
I SUBMITTED THAT PIECE THAT I WROTE ABOUT 
DAD PLAYING DOMINOES WITH THOSE OLD MEN.

01:56.100 --> 01:57.500
OH.

01:57.500 --> 02:01.100
WELL... 
OH, WELL.

02:01.100 --> 02:01.900
DON'T FEEL THAT BAD.

02:01.900 --> 02:04.400
LOOK, THIS ONE HAS A REAL SIGNATURE.
IT EVEN SMUDGES.

02:04.400 --> 02:06.400
YEAH, SOMEONE ACTUALLY TOOK
THE TIME TO REJECT YOU.

02:06.400 --> 02:08.800
YEAH, "THE ROOSEVELT WEEKLY"--
THAT WAS TOTALLY A FORM LETTER.

02:08.800 --> 02:11.400
YEAH,AND "WOMEN'S KNITTING JOURNAL"
CALLED YOU "SIR AND/OR MADAM."

02:11.400 --> 02:12.700
OKAY. 
NOT HELPING.

02:12.700 --> 02:14.200
DINNER IS SERVED!

02:15.100 --> 02:16.600
MAYBE THAT'LL HELP.

02:20.400 --> 02:23.900
SO DO WE FEEL PREGNANT YET?

02:24.300 --> 02:26.600
KEEP THOSE LEGS UP.
WE DON'T WANT ANYTHING FALLING OUT.

02:26.600 --> 02:28.500
HOW LONG
AM I TRAPPED HERFOR?

02:28.500 --> 02:30.500
WELL, YOU KNOW 
THE DOCTOR SAID BED REST 

02:30.500 --> 02:33.300
UNTIL WE'RE ABSOLUTELY SURE 
THE EMBRYO IS IMPLANTED.

02:33.500 --> 02:36.000
NOW I DON'T WANT YOU
LIFTING BEER KEGS

02:36.000 --> 02:38.100
WHATEVER IT IS YOU DO
IN YOUR SPARE TIME.

02:38.100 --> 02:39.900
-JUST A FEW MORE WEEKS.
-WEEKS? 

02:39.900 --> 02:41.000
WHAT AM I
GONNA DO IN HERE?

02:41.000 --> 02:43.500
MI CASA ES SU CASA.
SO, UH...

02:43.800 --> 02:45.200
READ MY BOOKS

02:45.200 --> 02:47.600
OR ENJOY
MY GOOSE DOWN PILLOWS.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.100
-NOT THIS ONE.
-UH.

02:52.200 --> 02:54.000
CHRISTINA, I...

02:55.000 --> 02:56.500
I CAN'T THANK YOU
ENOUGH FOR DOING THIS.

02:57.400 --> 02:59.500
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT THIS MEANS TO ME.

03:04.800 --> 03:06.000
ARE YOU TRYING
TO HUG ME?

03:06.800 --> 03:08.400
I'M AS SURPRISED
AS YOU ARE.

03:09.700 --> 03:11.100
THANK GOD THAT PASSED.

03:13.700 --> 03:15.100
KEEP THOSE LEGS UP.

03:17.000 --> 03:23.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:26.400 --> 03:28.300
OH HARRY

03:28.300 --> 03:32.300
I DON'T THINK SO THAT THOSE VOICE LESSONS
ARE REALLY PAYING OFF.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.700
YAEH.I DON'T KNOW 
THIS CLUB OWNER SAYS

03:35.700 --> 03:38.300
HE WON'T GIVE US ANY MORE 
GIGS WITH CLYDE AS SINGER.

03:38.300 --> 03:40.800
HEY, HENRY,
WHY DON'T YOU SING?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.100
I'VE HEARD YOU KARAOKE.

03:42.100 --> 03:43.700
I DON'T KNOW.
KARAOKE'S ONE THING.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.800
THESE PEOPLE WANT TO 
HEAR SOMEONE GOOD.

03:45.800 --> 03:48.100
WELL, AT LEAST
THE TURNOUT'S GOOD.

03:48.100 --> 03:49.300
YEAH, 29 PEOPLE.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.000
IF WE GET UP TO 30,
WE GET A CUT OF THE DOOR.

03:51.000 --> 03:52.100
OH!

03:52.100 --> 03:53.100
-OH.
-HEY.

03:53.100 --> 03:56.200
YES. 30. YOU GET
A FREE I.R.S. MOUSE PAD.

03:56.200 --> 03:57.200
DON'T GO ANYWHERE.

03:57.200 --> 03:58.500
-BE RIGHT BACK.
-OKAY.

03:58.500 --> 04:00.400
SO IS THAT THE BAND?

04:00.400 --> 04:01.100
UH-HUH.

04:01.100 --> 04:03.200
IT'S NOTEALLY
WHAT YOUR FLYER SUGGESTED.

04:03.200 --> 04:06.100
I GUESS I DID SEX IT UP A BIT
SO PEOPLE WOULD ACTUALLY COME,

04:06.100 --> 04:07.200
BUT IT'S IMPORTANT.

04:07.200 --> 04:09.600
HENRY'S TRYING TO MAKE SOME
EXTRA MONEY FOR THE BABY.

04:09.600 --> 04:13.200
OKAY, WELL, CAN I GIVE HIM
20 BUCKS AND THEN GO HOME?

04:14.200 --> 04:16.899
OR STAY
AND HAVE A BEER, YEAH.

04:17.399 --> 04:19.600
IT IS CALLED THE BEER HOLE,
SO IT'S PROBABLY PRETTY GOOD.

04:19.600 --> 04:21.800
OH, JUST SO YOU KNOW,
THERE'S A BAR NEXT DOOR

04:21.800 --> 04:23.800
CALLED THE BEAR HOLE,
SO YOU MIGHT HAVE LOST

04:23.800 --> 04:24.700
SOME OF YOUR AUDIENCE
OVER THERE.

04:24.700 --> 04:26.100
OH, NO.
???

04:26.100 --> 04:29.100
NO, NO. WAIT.
IT'S PROBABLY NOT A GOOD IDEA...

04:29.100 --> 04:31.800
HEY, HEY, QUICK.
COME DANCE WITH ME.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.700
WHAT?

04:32.700 --> 04:34.400
I WANT TO MAKE
MY BOYFRIEND JEALOUS.

04:35.000 --> 04:37.600
OH, UM, WELL,
WHICH ONE IS HE?

04:37.600 --> 04:39.200
YOU'LL FIND OUT
SOON ENOUGH.

04:39.500 --> 04:42.000
NOT THAT ONE WITH THE TATTOOS
OVER THERE, IS IT?

04:42.300 --> 04:43.100
THAT'S HIM.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.400
YOU CAN TAKE HIM, THOUGH.

04:44.400 --> 04:45.600
OH, RIGHT.

04:48.100 --> 04:51.200
OH, LOOK
WHO LIKES TO LIVE DANGEROUSLY.

04:51.200 --> 04:52.800
YOU KNOW,
I HAVE THE STRANGEST FLING

04:53.100 --> 04:54.900
YOU GUYS ARE GONNA BE
BREAKING UP SOON.

04:54.900 --> 04:56.900
-YOU SOUND CONFIDENT.
-I AM.

04:57.400 --> 04:59.900
 YOUR BOYFRIEND'S
MAKING OUT WITH ANOTHER DUDE.

05:03.600 --> 05:05.100
OKAY, YOU GOT ME.

05:05.500 --> 05:07.300
WHY DIDN'T YOU JUST
ASK ME TO DANCE?

05:07.700 --> 05:08.700
I DON'T KNOW.

05:10.000 --> 05:11.700
I GUESS I'M JUST SHY.

05:12.000 --> 05:14.600
YEAH.
I CAN TELL.

05:18.200 --> 05:21.900
AND ONE BANANATINI FOR 
AMANDA TANEN-SOMMERS-SIMMONS.

05:21.900 --> 05:25.000
WOW. REALLY
SEE THE RESEMBLANCE.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.700
UGH. WHAT AM I
GONNA DO, MARC?

05:27.700 --> 05:29.200
I FINALLY FIND OUT
WHO MY REAL FATHER IS,

05:29.200 --> 05:30.600
AND HE WON'T
RETURN MY CALLS

05:30.600 --> 05:32.900
OR MY E-MAILS
OR MY FATHER'S DAY CARDS.

05:32.900 --> 05:35.100
BLAH, BLAH, BLAH, 
TRAGEDY.

05:35.100 --> 05:37.600
YOU'RE SO 
ONE-NOTE LATELY.

05:38.200 --> 05:40.300
WAIT.
THAT GIVES ME AN IDEA.

05:40.300 --> 05:41.900
GENE SIMMONS IS
A MUSICIAN, RIGHT?

05:42.200 --> 05:45.300
SO MAYBE YOU NEED TO COMMUNICATE
WITH HIM IN HIS OWN LANGUAGE.

05:45.300 --> 05:45.900
HEBREW?

05:45.900 --> 05:48.800
NO. NO.
THE LANGUAGE OF MUSIC.

05:48.800 --> 05:50.700
YOU SHOULD WRITE
A SONG FOR HIM

05:50.700 --> 05:53.200
ABOUT HIM BEING YOUR FATHER.
HE CAN'T IGNORE THAT.

05:53.400 --> 05:55.400
YOU KNOW WHAT?
???

05:55.400 --> 05:57.400
I PROBABLY DO HAVE
SONGWRITING IN MY GENES.

05:57.400 --> 05:59.700
EXACTLY. SO ALL YOU NEED
TO DO IS WRITE A SONG,

05:59.700 --> 06:02.200
PRACTICE SINGING IT,
RECORD IT, MAKE A VIDEO OF IT,

06:02.200 --> 06:05.700
POST THE VIDEO ON YouTube
AND THEN WAIT FOR HIM TO SEE IT.

06:05.900 --> 06:08.400
MARC, IT'S SO SIMPLE,
IT'S BRILLIANT.

06:11.700 --> 06:14.100
OH, WHO SAYS
WHITE GUYS CAN'T DANCE?

06:14.800 --> 06:16.000
I'M RENEE.

06:16.100 --> 06:18.400
-I'M DANIEL.
-MEADE. I KNOW.

06:18.400 --> 06:20.000
-OH.
-EVERYBODY KNOWS.

06:21.800 --> 06:24.700
OOH. YOUR LEG IS VIBRATING,
DANIEL MEADE.

06:24.700 --> 06:25.800
OH, I KNOW.

06:26.300 --> 06:28.600
OH, SORRY.
IT'S, UH, MY PHONE.YEAH.

06:33.500 --> 06:34.300
EVERYTHING OKAY?

06:34.300 --> 06:36.800
YEAH, IT'S JUST
A WORK THING.

06:37.200 --> 06:38.900
CAN YOU HOLD ON
A SECOND?

06:39.100 --> 06:40.800
OH, AND STAY RIGHT THERE?

06:40.800 --> 06:43.600
DON'T INVENT ANY DANGEROUS 
GAY BOYFRIEND FOR ANYONE ELSE.

06:43.600 --> 06:45.500
THAT'S OUR THING, OKAY?

06:48.700 --> 06:50.900
OH, OH, 
HERE HE IS.

06:52.300 --> 06:52.900
VOIL?

06:52.900 --> 06:54.300
OH, THANK YOU.

06:54.300 --> 06:55.600
COULD I TALK
TO YOU FOR A SECOND?

06:55.600 --> 06:56.500
OH.

06:57.100 --> 06:59.600
DO YOU STILL HAVE THAT LIST OF 
FREELANCERS ON YOUR BlackBerry?

06:59.600 --> 07:02.200
THE WRITER FOR THE PHIL ROTH
INTERVIEW JUST DROPPED OUT.

07:02.600 --> 07:05.000
WHAT? I DIDN'T KNOW "MODE"
WAS DOING A PIECE ON HIM.

07:05.000 --> 07:06.300
-I LOVE HIM.
-YOU DO?

07:06.300 --> 07:08.700
OKAY, UH, DANIEL,
HEAR ME OUT.

07:08.700 --> 07:11.600
DO YOU REMEMBER WHEN YOU
ACCIDENTALLY MADE TWO DATES

07:11.600 --> 07:13.400
WITH TWO DIFFERENT WOMEN
AT THE SAME RESTAURANT

07:13.400 --> 07:14.100
OH, MY GOD.

07:14.100 --> 07:15.500
AND--AND I HAD TO FAKE
THE SEIZURE 

07:15.500 --> 07:17.700
SO YOU COULD RUN OUT THE BACK DOOR
WITH THE PRETTIER ONE?

07:17.700 --> 07:19.400
WHAT WAS THE LAST THING
YOU SAID TO ME? 

07:19.400 --> 07:21.400
"BETTY, I OWE YOU."

07:21.400 --> 07:22.900
COME ON.
THIS IS A HUGE ARTICLE.

07:22.900 --> 07:25.700
THE MARE D' SHOVED SO I WOULDN'T
SWALLOW MY TONGUE.

07:28.200 --> 07:29.900
OKAY. OKAY. 
ALL RIGHT.

07:30.600 --> 07:31.700
A THOUSAND WORDS
BY FRIDAY.

07:31.700 --> 07:33.500
OH, MY GOD. 
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

07:33.500 --> 07:34.500
YOU'RE GONNA 
LET ME DO THIS.

07:34.500 --> 07:35.400
I HAVE FAITH IN YOU.

07:35.400 --> 07:37.500
OH, MY GOD, DANIEL. THANK YOU.
THANK YOU. THANK YOU!

07:37.500 --> 07:39.900
BESIDES, WHO ELSE ARE WE GONNA 
???

07:39.900 --> 07:42.200
I'M JUST GONNA PRETEND
YOU STOPPED AT "I HAVE FAITH IN YOU."

07:42.200 --> 07:43.300
HENRY!

07:47.100 --> 07:48.000
LET ME TURN ON A LIGHT.

07:48.000 --> 07:51.000
NO, NO, NO, KEEP 'EM OFF.
IT'S MORE FUN IN THE DARK.

07:53.400 --> 07:56.200
THAT'S NOT THE BOOB
YOU THINK IT IS.

07:59.200 --> 07:59.800
MOM!

07:59.800 --> 08:03.400
OKAY, THAT'S LIKE $100,000
WORTH OF THERAPY RIGHT THERE.

08:03.400 --> 08:04.900
I DIDN'T KNOW SHE WAS HERE.
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

08:04.900 --> 08:07.200
I HAD TO GET OUT OF THE HOUSE.
IT WAS TOO MANY MEMORIES.

08:07.200 --> 08:09.100
IN THE UNLIKELY EVENT
THAT WHATEVER 

08:09.100 --> 08:12.300
THIS IS LASTS FOR 40 YEARS,
YOU'LL UNDERSTAND.

08:12.300 --> 08:13.900
-I'M CLAIRE.
-RENEE.

08:14.100 --> 08:15.900
DON'T LET ME
GET IN YOUR WAY, RENEE.

08:15.900 --> 08:19.000
I'LL JUST GO SLEEP ON THE COUCH.

08:19.000 --> 08:20.600
DO WHATEVER YOU LIKE.

08:20.600 --> 08:24.100
IN PRISON, I LEARNED
I CAN SLEEP THROUGH ANYTHING.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.400
I...

08:27.000 --> 08:29.000
SHE'S GOING THROUGH
A REALLY HARD TIME NOW--

08:29.000 --> 08:30.500
DON'T EVEN
WORRY ABOUT IT.

08:32.100 --> 08:35.500
A MAN THAT TAKES CARE OF HIS MOM 
KNOWS HOW TO TREAT A WOMAN.

08:37.299 --> 08:38.799
WE'LL DO THIS AGAIN.

08:51.900 --> 08:52.700
HEY, BETTY.

08:52.700 --> 08:53.800
HI, GIO.

08:54.200 --> 08:57.600
SO DID YOU HEAR?
PHIL ROTH IS IN THE HOUSE.

08:57.900 --> 08:59.800
OH, YOU KNOW
WHO PHILIP ROTH IS?

08:59.800 --> 09:02.200
AUTHOR OF "PORTNOY'S COMPLAINT,"
"GOODBYE, COLUMBUS"--

09:02.200 --> 09:04.000
"AMERICAN PASTORAL," YEAH.

09:04.100 --> 09:06.300
NOT EVERYONE WHO
MAKES SANDWICHES IS A LUNK.

09:06.300 --> 09:07.000
HMM.

09:07.000 --> 09:09.600
BUT THE GUY IN YOUR CONFERENCE ROOM 
IS NOT PHILIP ROTH

09:09.600 --> 09:10.800
IT IS PHIL ROTH.

09:10.800 --> 09:13.200
WHAT? 
WHO'S PHIL ROTH?

09:13.200 --> 09:15.800
HE WRITES BOOKS
ON HOW TO PICK UP CHICKS.

09:15.800 --> 09:18.000
UGH. OH, MY GOD.

09:18.000 --> 09:19.500
DANIEL SAID PHIL ROTH,

09:19.500 --> 09:22.100
BUT I JUST THOUGHT HE WAS DOING
HIS ANNOYING CASUAL THING

09:22.100 --> 09:24.300
BOBBY De NIRO,
MARTY SCORSESE.

09:24.300 --> 09:26.600
I DON'T WANT TO INTERVIEW A GUY 
WHO WRITES BOOKS LIKE THAT.

09:26.600 --> 09:29.800
HEY.YOU GET TO WRITE
AN ARTICLE, OKAY?

09:29.800 --> 09:31.800
NOW GO IN THERE
WITH AN OPEN MIND.

09:32.800 --> 09:34.800
HE'S ACTUALLY GOT
A LOT TO SAY.

09:46.100 --> 09:47.000
MR. ROTH?

09:47.000 --> 09:49.000
HELLO.
I'M BETTY SUAREZ.

09:49.000 --> 09:52.700
UM, I'M HERE TO INTERVIEW YOU
ABOUT YOUR NEW BOOK.

09:52.700 --> 09:56.000
"TAP THAT!--HOW TO SCORE
WITH HOT BITCHES."

09:58.800 --> 10:02.800
<font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com present</font>

10:04.200 --> 10:08.200
<font color="#ffff00">Capture:FRM@ÇòÇò
Sync:FRM@°®Ð¦µÄÑÛ¾¦</font> 

10:10.300 --> 10:10.900
UGLY BETTY  S02E13

10:10.900 --> 10:11.900
TAP THAT!

10:11.900 --> 10:14.500
-HOW TO SCORE WITH HOT
-YEP.I SEE IT.

10:14.500 --> 10:15.400
IT'S RIGHT THERE.

10:15.800 --> 10:17.000
BUT FOR THE SAKE
OF THIS INTERVIEW,

10:17.000 --> 10:18.800
WHY DON'T WE CALL IT
SOMETHING NICER,

10:18.800 --> 10:20.500
LIKE, UH,
"GOODBYE, COLUMBUS

10:20.500 --> 10:23.400
SO, MR. ROTH, WHAT MADE YOU
DECIDE TO WRITE...

10:23.400 --> 10:25.000
"GOODBYE, COLUMBUS"?

10:25.000 --> 10:27.900
MEN WANT TO GET LAID, BETTY,
AND I WANT TO HELP THEM.

10:28.000 --> 10:30.800
OKAY. OKAY, SO, UH,
YOU'RE A GIVER.

10:30.800 --> 10:33.700
YES, I AM.
MY TECHNIQUE IS SIMPLE--

10:33.700 --> 10:36.300
APPROACH, SUBDUE, SCORE.

10:36.300 --> 10:37.800
EASY WAY TO REMEMBER IT

10:37.800 --> 10:39.000
ASS.

10:39.000 --> 10:41.600
OKAY. ASS.
THAT'S CLEVER.

10:41.600 --> 10:43.300
I THINK I SMELL A PULITZER.

10:43.300 --> 10:44.000
OH.

10:44.000 --> 10:47.500
UH, LET'S DISCUSS
THIS TECHNIQUE OF YOURS.

10:47.600 --> 10:51.500
MOST MEN THINK THAT COMPLIMENTING
A WOMAN IS THE WAY TO LAND HER.

10:51.500 --> 10:52.200
WRONG. 

10:52.200 --> 10:55.000
MY METHOD STARTS
 WITH AN E.K.

10:55.800 --> 10:59.100
-ESTEEM KILLER.
-ESTEEM... LLER.

10:59.100 --> 11:01.900
THE EASIEST WAY TO BAG A WOMAN
IS TO INSULT HER.

11:01.900 --> 11:03.100
MR. ROTH...

11:03.100 --> 11:05.600
DO YOU ACTUALLY BELIEVE 
THAT WOMEN FALL FOR THAT?

11:05.600 --> 11:06.600
BETTY, ARE YOU GONNA BE LONG?

11:06.600 --> 11:08.200
BECAUSE CALLS
KEEP COMING IN FOR DANIEL,

11:08.200 --> 11:11.300
AND I'M FINDING IT REALLY HARD TO 
CONCENTRATE ON MY PERSONAL ISSUES.

11:12.600 --> 11:13.600
WOW.

11:13.600 --> 11:15.300
THAT IS SO GREAT
THAT YOU'RE NOT WORRIED

11:15.300 --> 11:17.500
WHAT THAT DOUGHNUT'S
GONNA DO TO YOUR HIPS.

11:19.800 --> 11:21.400
WHAT DID YOU JUST SAY TO M

11:21.400 --> 11:24.100
NOW AFTER THE E.K.
COMES THE IGNORING.

11:24.300 --> 11:26.300
WAIT, SO DO YOU THINK
I'M FAT?

11:26.300 --> 11:28.300
SHE CAN'T STAND IT
WHEN A GUY IGNORES HER.

11:28.300 --> 11:30.000
UM, PRETTY GIRL 
TALKING HERE.

11:30.000 --> 11:30.800
HELLO.

11:30.800 --> 11:33.000
ROCK THEIR CONFIDENCE,
AND THE POWER IS ALL YOURS.

11:33.000 --> 11:34.900
WHO ARE YOU? WHAT'S YOUR NAME?
WHY DON'T YOU LIKE ME?

11:36.900 --> 11:38.300
USUALLY IT DOESN'T WORK
THAT QUICK.

11:38.300 --> 11:40.400
UM... OKAY.

11:40.400 --> 11:42.100
UH, GREAT.
YOU KNOW WHAT, MR. ROTH?

11:42.100 --> 11:43.300
I THINK I HAVE
EVERYTHING I NEED.

11:43.300 --> 11:47.000
-SO THANK YOU VERY MUCH,MR. ROTH.
-HERE, LET--LET ME JUST,UH...

11:47.500 --> 11:51.500
TO BETTY, BIG LOVE,
PHIL.

11:51.900 --> 11:54.300
THANKS.
COME ON, AMANDA.

11:54.300 --> 11:55.800
NO, I THINK 
I LOVE HIM.

11:58.300 --> 12:00.500
MOM, I CAN'T TONIGHT.
I ALREADY HAVE DINNER PLANS.

12:00.500 --> 12:01.700
THAT'S JUST TERRIFIC.

12:01.700 --> 12:03.900
AND YOUR SISTER HAS
HER TRANSGENDER SUPPORT GROUP.

12:03.900 --> 12:05.300
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

12:05.300 --> 12:06.700
YOU CAN DO ANYTHING
YOU'D LIKE.

12:06.700 --> 12:08.700
YOU KNOW, WHY DON'T YOU START
RECONNECTING WITH PEOPLE?

12:08.700 --> 12:10.300
CALL SOME OF
YOUR OLD FRIENDS UP.

12:10.300 --> 12:11.200
WELL, I WOULD, 

12:11.200 --> 12:14.300
EXCEPT IT SEEMS THAT PRISON, MURDER
AND TEMPORARY INSANITY

12:14.300 --> 12:16.000
ARE A TURNOFF
TO THE COUNTRY CLUB SET.

12:16.000 --> 12:18.100
OKAY, UH, 
MAYBE I CAN ???

12:18.100 --> 12:19.900
OH, DON'T BOTHER.

12:19.900 --> 12:23.400
I'LL JUST SPEND THE NIGHT
CLEANING YOUR APARTMENT...

12:23.400 --> 12:24.400
AGAIN.

12:24.400 --> 12:26.000
OH, BY THE WAY,

12:26.300 --> 12:30.000
I SEE YOU STILL KEEP YOUR
MAGAZINES UNDER THE MATTRESS,

12:30.000 --> 12:32.000
JUST LIKE WHEN YOU WERE 14.

12:32.000 --> 12:34.700
COME ON, MOM. I TOLD YOU
TO STAY OUT OF MY STUFF.

12:34.700 --> 12:36.600
AND DON'T GO
IN MY TOP DRESSER DRAWER.

12:36.600 --> 12:37.700
OOH.

12:37.700 --> 12:38.700
NO, NO.
FORGET I SAID THAT.

12:38.700 --> 12:41.100
MOM, HE-HELLO?

12:41.100 --> 12:42.100
SHE STILL SNOOPING?

12:42.100 --> 12:44.100
YEAH, I HAVE GOT TO
GET HER OUT OF MY PLACE.

12:44.100 --> 12:46.200
SHE'S JUST SO LONELY
THESE DAYS.

12:46.300 --> 12:48.600
CAN YOU LOOK INTO
SOME OF THOSE CLASSES

12:48.600 --> 12:50.500
OR SENIOR CRUISES
OR SOMETHING?

12:50.500 --> 12:51.500
ALL RIGHT. 
NO PROBLEM.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.200
-OH, AND, DANIEL.
-YEAH.

12:55.700 --> 12:56.800
HERE YOU GO...

12:57.600 --> 12:58.700
A THOUSAND WORDS.

12:58.700 --> 13:00.400
YOU FINISHED
YOUR ARTICLE ALREADY.

13:00.400 --> 13:01.600
WOW.YOU ARE EAGER.

13:01.600 --> 13:03.400
OH, AND, UM, THIS ACTUALLY
IS AN ARTICLE

13:03.400 --> 13:05.600
ABOUT HILDA STARTING
HER OWN BUSINESS.

13:05.600 --> 13:08.500
IT'S VERY WOMAN POSITIVE,
AND I THINK OUR READERS WILL RESPOND.

13:08.500 --> 13:11.400
WHERE IS MY PHIL ROTH STORY?
THAT WAS THE ASSIGNMENT.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.000
DANIEL, 
I'M SORRY.

13:13.000 --> 13:16.000
I THOUGHT THAT I WAS DOING
AN INTERVIEW WITH PHILIP ROTH,

13:16.000 --> 13:18.100
AND YOU WERE JUST
CALLING HIM "PHIL."

13:18.100 --> 13:19.300
BUT I DON'T KNOW PHILIP ROTH.

13:19.300 --> 13:20.700
BUT YOU DON'T KNOW
ROBERT De NIRO,

13:20.700 --> 13:21.700
AND YOU CALL HIM "BOBBY."

13:22.500 --> 13:23.200
WHAT?

13:23.200 --> 13:24.700
LOOK, 
THIS PHIL ROTH GUY,

13:24.700 --> 13:26.800
HE TURNED OUT TO BE
A DISGUSTING PIG.

13:26.800 --> 13:29.600
DO YOU REALLY WANT TO GIVE A GUY LIKE 
THAT FACE TIME IN YOUR MAGAZINE?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.400
BETTY, HE WRITES ARTICLES
ABOUT PICKING UP WOMEN.

13:32.500 --> 13:33.600
OUR READERS ARE WOMEN.

13:33.600 --> 13:35.400
DON'T YOU THINK THEY WANT
TO KNOW WHAT MEN ARE THINKING?

13:35.400 --> 13:38.200
WELL, NOT WHEN IT'S A BUNCH
OF MISOGYNIST GARBAGE.

13:38.500 --> 13:40.100
DID YOU EVEN READ THE BOOK?

13:41.700 --> 13:43.900
NO. I REREAD
"GOODBYE, COLUMBUS,"

13:43.900 --> 13:45.100
BUT, DANIEL, I DON'T
HAVE TO READ THE BOOK.

13:45.100 --> 13:46.300
JUST LOOK AT THE COVER.

13:46.300 --> 13:49.200
IT IS A PICTURE OF A WOMAN
BEING SERVED ON A PLATTER.

13:49.200 --> 13:51.900
YOU ARE LITERALLY
JUDGING A BOOK BY ITS COVER.

13:51.900 --> 13:53.500
SHE HAS AN APPLE
IN HER MOUTH.

13:55.200 --> 13:58.100
LOOK, DANIEL, 
I JUST...

13:58.100 --> 14:00.100
I CAN'T WRITE OBJECTIVELY 
ABOUT A GUY 

14:00.100 --> 14:02.300
I CAN'T EVEN BE
IN THE SAME ROOM WITH.

14:04.000 --> 14:06.300
OKAY.
YOU'RE OFF THE ASSIGNMENT.

14:07.600 --> 14:08.500
THANK YOU.

14:09.300 --> 14:11.100
ACTUALLY...
I DIDN'T WANT TO SAY IT,

14:11.100 --> 14:13.500
BUT, UH, PHIL CALLED AND ASKED
FOR A DIFFERENT WRITER.

14:13.800 --> 14:16.100
I HAD FOUGHT FOR YOU,
BUT I CAN GET SOMEONE ELSE.

14:16.100 --> 14:17.900
WHAT? HE ASKED FOR
ANOTHER WRITER?

14:17.900 --> 14:19.500
YEAH. HE JUST FELT
 YOU WERE A LITTLE,

14:19.500 --> 14:20.900
YOU KNOW, CLOSED-MINDED.

14:20.900 --> 14:24.700
?? SOMETHING ELSE WILL COME ALONG
THAT'S A LITTLE MORE YOU.

14:24.700 --> 14:26.200
CLOSED-MINDED?

14:26.200 --> 14:28.700
WHY, BECAUSE I'M SKEPTICAL
OF HIS RIDICULOUS BOOK?

14:28.700 --> 14:31.000
YEAH, AND I'M GONNA NEED
THAT LIST OF FREELANCERS, TOO.

14:31.000 --> 14:33.400
NO. NO

14:33.400 --> 14:36.100
I AM JUST AS OPEN-MINDED
AS THE NEXT PERSON.

14:37.700 --> 14:38.600
YOU KNOW WHAT?

14:38.800 --> 14:40.200
I WANT TO 
DO THIS INTERVIEW.

14:40.200 --> 14:42.100
I'LL EVEN READ 
HIS STUPID BOOK.

14:42.100 --> 14:45.000
YOU KNOW WHY?
BECAUSE I AM OPEN-MINDED.

14:46.600 --> 14:47.700
YEP.

14:51.300 --> 14:52.300
NICE PLACE.

14:52.300 --> 14:53.400
SHUT UP
AND KISS ME.

14:54.700 --> 14:57.200
SO... WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WANTED DINNER...

14:57.200 --> 14:59.300
MM-HMM.
OH, YEAH.

14:59.300 --> 15:00.500
I ACTUALLY WANTED DINNER.

15:02.000 --> 15:03.700
AND THEN I SAW
THAT FINE ASS OF YOURS,

15:03.700 --> 15:06.200
AND I WAS LIKE,
"WHO THE HELL NEEDS CHICKEN?"

15:07.200 --> 15:07.900
NOT ME.

15:08.900 --> 15:10.300
I HATE CHICKEN.

15:11.400 --> 15:12.400
GET IN HERE.

15:35.800 --> 15:36.700
AAH!

15:36.700 --> 15:38.200
-AAH!
-AAH!

15:38.200 --> 15:39.800
I SEE YOU MET
MY SISTER.

15:43.000 --> 15:45.600
NOW WAIT A MINUTE.
YOUR SISTER?

15:45.900 --> 15:49.300
HOW COULD YOU NEGLECT TO MENTION 
THAT WILHELMINA SLATER IS YOUR SISTER?

15:49.300 --> 15:50.900
DIDN'T THINK IT WAS
THAT BIG OF A DEAL.

15:50.900 --> 15:53.300
ANYONE WHO'S READ A PAPER 
OR WATCHED TV IN, 

15:53.300 --> 15:55.800
LIKE,THE LAST TWO YEARS KNOWS 
HER HISTORY WITH MY FAMILY.

15:55.800 --> 15:58.700
LOOK, BABY, 
I'M SORRY.

15:58.700 --> 16:00.400
I DIDN'T PLAN ANY OF THIS.

16:00.400 --> 16:02.300
I SAW YOU,
AND I LIKED YOU,

16:02.300 --> 16:04.000
AND I JUST THOUGHT 
THAT TELLING YOU

16:04.000 --> 16:06.400
I WAS WILHELMINA'S SISTER 
WOULD SCARE YOU OFF.

16:07.600 --> 16:08.900
WELL, IT DID.

16:10.400 --> 16:11.700
GOOD-BYE, RENEE.

16:14.000 --> 16:16.400
LEAVING SO SOON?
THE SHOWER'S FREE.

16:16.900 --> 16:20.200
BY THE WAY, DANIEL, I...
UNDERESTIMATED YOU.

16:25.000 --> 16:26.500
WHAT THE HELL
WERE YOU THINKING?

16:26.500 --> 16:28.100
THAT YOU'D REACT THIS WAY.

16:28.800 --> 16:32.400
YOU DON'T DATE DANIEL MEADE.
I DID YOU A FAVOR.

16:32.400 --> 16:33.800
YOU SHOWED UP HERE
WITH NO PLACE TO STAY,

16:33.800 --> 16:34.900
AND I TOOK YOU IN,

16:34.900 --> 16:36.500
AND THIS IS HOW YOU REPAY ME?

16:37.700 --> 16:39.400
CALM DOWN, WILHELMINA.

16:39.400 --> 16:41.200
OR SHOULD I SAY WANDA?

16:41.200 --> 16:44.200
WELL, YOU LISTEN TO ME, RENEE,
OR SHOULD I SAY RHONDA?

16:44.200 --> 16:46.600
I GOT A LOT GOING ON
RIGHT NOW WITH THIS BABY.

16:46.800 --> 16:50.300
AND I DON'T NEED ANY OF
THE MEADES KNOWING MY BUSINESS.

16:50.400 --> 16:52.200
STAY AWAY FROM HIM.

16:52.200 --> 16:54.700
IF IT WEREN'T FOR 
THE CROW'S-FEET AND FROWN LINES,

16:54.700 --> 16:57.600
I'D THINK YOU WERE STILL THE TEENAGE 
SISTER TRYING TO BOSS ME AROUND.

16:58.600 --> 17:01.500
I'LL DATE
WHOEVER I WANT.

17:16.300 --> 17:19.200
CALCIUM...
FOR THE LITTLE ONE.

17:20.500 --> 17:22.200
WANDA.

17:23.800 --> 17:26.000
SHE'S WILHELMINA'S SISTER?

17:26.099 --> 17:27.400
THAT WAS
A TOTALLY FAKE GASP.

17:27.400 --> 17:30.100
I KNOW. CHRISTINA ALREADY
TOLD ME, BUT I'M STILL SHOCKED.

17:30.100 --> 17:31.500
DANIEL, YOU CAN'T DATE H

17:31.500 --> 17:32.500
NO, I KNOW.

17:32.500 --> 17:34.500
WILHELMINA TRIED TO
DESTROY YOU

17:34.500 --> 17:36.800
AND YOUR FAMILY
AND YOUR MAGAZINE.

17:36.800 --> 17:38.200
I'M NOT ARGUING WITH YOU,

17:38.200 --> 17:41.300
IT JUST SUCKS
BECAUSE I REALLY...

17:41.700 --> 17:44.500
I REALLY--I LIKED RENEE.

17:44.500 --> 17:46.000
OH.

17:49.000 --> 17:50.900
SORRY, DORKSTICK.
I WAS HERE FIRST.

17:50.900 --> 17:52.200
UM, CLEARLY,
I WAS HERE FIRST,

17:52.200 --> 17:53.800
BECAUSE MY FLYER
IS UNDERNEATH YOURS.

17:53.800 --> 17:55.200
WHICH IS WHERE IT WILL STAY.

17:55.200 --> 17:56.500
LOOK, THIS IS IMPORTANT.

17:56.500 --> 17:58.800
I NEED TO FIND
A NEW LEAD SINGER FOR MY BAND.

17:58.800 --> 18:01.500
WELL, MINE'S MORE IMPORTANT BECAUSE 
I NEED TO FIND A BAND TO RECORD MY SONG.

18:01.500 --> 18:03.600
YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE NOT
GONNA ALLOW US TO PERFORM

18:03.600 --> 18:04.600
IF I DON'T HAVE
A NEW LEAD SINGER.

18:04.600 --> 18:07.300
AND I WON'T BE ABLE ???
IF I DON'T FIND A BAND.

18:08.400 --> 18:09.600
WAIT, YOU NEED A BAND?

18:11.100 --> 18:12.600
YES.

18:12.600 --> 18:17.700
DO YOU KNOW
WHERE I CAN FIND ONE?

18:21.900 --> 18:22.800
OH, MY GOD.

18:22.800 --> 18:24.300
I NEED TO CALL THESE PEOPLE
RIGHT AWAY.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.500
HELLO, AMANDA.

18:33.200 --> 18:34.100
"TAP THAT!"?

18:35.100 --> 18:36.800
IT'S ABOUT TAP DANCING.

18:36.800 --> 18:37.900
OOH! COULD I READ IT
AFTER YOU?

18:37.900 --> 18:38.700
NO.

18:38.900 --> 18:41.300
AND ALWAYS REMEMBER,
TAPPING IS DEMEANING TO WOMEN.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.200
OKAY.

18:44.900 --> 18:46.700
OKAY,
THAT'S YOUR FOURTH GROAN.

18:47.100 --> 18:49.700
I'M SORRY I CAN'T HELP IT.
JUST LISTEN TO THIS.

18:49.700 --> 18:52.400
"ONCE YOU'VE LEARNED
THE ART OF THE 'NOVA,'

18:52.400 --> 18:55.500
YOU CAN MAKE A WOMAN
SUCCUMB TO YOUR WILL"?

18:55.500 --> 18:58.100
NOVA? I HAVEN'T GOTTEN
TO THAT. WHAT IS THAT?

18:58.600 --> 19:00.000
IT MEANS PICK UP,

19:00.000 --> 19:01.900
LIKE CASANOVA
OR THE CHEAP CARS

19:01.900 --> 19:03.400
WHERE THESE GUYS
TRY AND GET LUCKY.

19:03.400 --> 19:07.000
"I WAS A COMPLETE CHUMP,
CLUELESS TO THE WAYS OF WOMEN,

19:07.000 --> 19:09.700
BUT ALL THAT CHANGED
WITH MY FIRST CRIT."

19:09.700 --> 19:10.800
CRIT? 
WHERE'S THAT?

19:10.800 --> 19:13.300
CHAPTER SEVEN.
IT MEANS CRITICISM.

19:13.300 --> 19:15.500
THIS LOSER ACTUALLY THINKS
THAT INSULTING A WOMAN

19:15.500 --> 19:17.600
WILL TURN THE TABLES 
AND MAKE HER WANT TO WIN YOU OVER.

19:17.600 --> 19:18.700
GENIUS.

19:18.900 --> 19:19.400
WHAT?

19:19.400 --> 19:20.700
HEINOUS.

19:23.300 --> 19:24.300
THIS MIGHT WORK ON AMANDA,

19:24.300 --> 19:26.700
BUT I DOUBT IT ACTUALLY WORKS
ON REAL PEOPLE.

19:27.100 --> 19:30.600
WELL, YOU SHOULD GO OUT,
SEE IT IN ACTION.

19:30.600 --> 19:32.800
COME ON. THIS COULD BE
A BIG OPPORTUNITY,

19:32.800 --> 19:34.000
AND THEN
YOU CAN WRITE ABOUT IT,

19:34.000 --> 19:35.500
'CAUSE IF IT WORKS,
YOU LEARN SOMETHING,

19:35.500 --> 19:37.900
IF IT DOESN'T, YOU CAN
CALL HIM ON IT IN YOUR ARTICLE.

19:37.900 --> 19:39.200
THAT'S A GREAT IDEA.

19:39.600 --> 19:42.600
ALL I NEED IS SOME GUY WHO COULD
ACTUALLY PULL THIS CRAP OFF.

19:43.700 --> 19:45.500
AH! I'LL CALL GIO.

19:46.400 --> 19:47.900
WH--GIO? WHY HIM?

19:47.900 --> 19:49.500
BECAUSE
HE LOVES THIS IDIOT.

19:49.500 --> 19:50.800
HE'S READ EVERYTHING
HE'S EVER WRITTEN.

19:50.800 --> 19:53.200
DON'T BOTHER GIO.
I CAN HELP YOU WITH THIS.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.300
OH, HONEY...

19:54.300 --> 19:55.700
THIS ISN'T YOU.

19:55.700 --> 19:58.700
GIO IS A TOTAL DOG.
HE'S PERFECT.

20:01.800 --> 20:04.000
I THINK I'M GONNA NOVA
THAT BLONDIE OVER THERE.

20:04.800 --> 20:07.200
GIO, DON'T YOU THINK SHE'S 
A LITTLE OUT OF YOUR LEAGUE?

20:07.200 --> 20:08.900
LEAGUE? I'M A GUY.

20:08.900 --> 20:10.500
THE UNIVERSE IS MY LEAGUE

20:11.700 --> 20:12.800
NOW WATCH THIS.

20:15.600 --> 20:18.100
OH. WELL,
I HOPE YOU'RE HAPPY.

20:18.300 --> 20:21.500
IN THE SECONDS I WASTED TALKING TO YOU,
SOME OTHER GUY GOT TRE.

20:37.000 --> 20:38.600
HENRY,
WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

20:38.600 --> 20:39.600
HELPING YOU.

20:39.600 --> 20:41.700
STATISTICALLY SPEAKING,
TWO TEST SUBJECTS

20:41.700 --> 20:44.200
INCREASES YOUR CHANCES OF
VALITING THIS MATING THEORY.

20:44.200 --> 20:45.700
YOU SHOULD OPEN WITH THAT.

20:45.700 --> 20:46.600
CHICKS LOVE IT.

20:46.600 --> 20:48.700
HEY, I CAN "TAP THAT!"
BETTER THAN YOU.

20:48.900 --> 20:49.700
ARE YOU SERIOUS?

20:49.700 --> 20:51.200
SERIOUS AS A NOVA.

20:51.200 --> 20:55.100
OKAY, GUYS, NO. THIS IS
MY RESEARCH, NOT A CONTEST.

20:55.100 --> 20:56.700
WHOEVER GETS
THE MOST PHONE NUMBERS WINS.

20:56.700 --> 20:59.200
-ARE YOU SERIOUS?
-GAME ON, SANDWICH BOY.

20:59.800 --> 21:03.000
WHAT? HOLD ON.
HENRY, YOU HAVE A GIRLFRIEND.

21:03.000 --> 21:04.400
NOT TONIGHT,
I DON'T.

21:04.700 --> 21:07.900
I-I MEAN JUST FOR THE PURPOSES
OF THIS RESEARCH.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.000
OKAY.

21:11.600 --> 21:14.400
RESEARCH.

21:15.200 --> 21:18.900
OH, UM, HELLO. I, UM...

21:23.000 --> 21:25.700
-HELLO.
-ALL RIGHT.CATCH YOU LATER.

21:26.000 --> 21:28.200
YOU HAVE A BEAUTIFUL FACE.

21:29.000 --> 21:31.500
YOUR DOCTOR DID
AN AMAZING JOB.

21:31.500 --> 21:34.700
WHAT? NO, YOU DID NOT
JUST SAY THAT.

21:35.700 --> 21:36.600
CUTE OUTFIT.

21:36.600 --> 21:38.600
YOU KNOW, SOME PEOPLE
MAY CALL IT SLUTTY,

21:38.600 --> 21:40.200
BUT I THINK
IT REALLY WORKS ON YOU.

21:40.200 --> 21:41.500
ARE YOU TALKING TO ME?

21:42.400 --> 21:43.900
THAT IS NOT
YOUR REAL NOSE.

21:44.800 --> 21:47.400
NO, IT IS.
IT TOTALLY IS.

21:47.400 --> 21:48.900
EWW.
NO. 

21:48.900 --> 21:51.900
SLUTTY WOULD BE
IF IT WENT UP TO HERE.

21:51.900 --> 21:54.700
I DON'T KNOW.
I'M NOT CONVINCED YET.

22:04.700 --> 22:05.900
HERE YOU GO.

22:10.300 --> 22:12.300
YOU KNOW, I LOVE THAT
YOU HAVE A BRAIN.

22:12.300 --> 22:15.800
IT'S SO NICE TO MEET A GIRL WHO DOESN'T 
BUY INTO THE WHOLE SKINNY THING.

22:16.100 --> 22:17.800
NOT ALL GIRLS
HAVE TO BE PRETTY.

22:18.300 --> 22:20.200
I AM REALLY IMPRESSED
THAT YOU'RE NOT INTIMIDATED

22:20.200 --> 22:21.700
BY ALL THE YOU WOMEN HERE.

22:21.700 --> 22:23.600
MAN, YOU'VE GOT
SOME BIG FEET.

22:28.300 --> 22:30.800
ALL RIGHT.I'M GONNA WRITE IT DOWN.
YOU BETTER NOT LOSE IT.

22:30.800 --> 22:32.300
HERE YOU GO.

22:33.200 --> 22:34.000
HEY!

22:34.000 --> 22:35.200
THANK YOU.

22:40.100 --> 22:41.600
HEY, WHAT ARE YOU
STILL DOING HERE?

22:41.600 --> 22:42.700
I'M JUST WORKING LATE.

22:43.700 --> 22:44.600
WHO IS SHE?

22:44.600 --> 22:47.400
YOU ONLY WORK LATE
WHEN THERE'S A WOMAN TO HIDE FROM.

22:47.900 --> 22:48.800
IT'S MOM.

22:48.800 --> 22:51.500
ALEXIS, YOU GOTTA HELP ME.
PLEASE TAKHER FOR A WHILE.

22:51.500 --> 22:54.300
NO. SHE'S BEEN STAYING WITH ME
SINCE SHE WAS ACQUITTED.

22:54.300 --> 22:56.100
SHE EVEN CAME TO
MY TRANSGENDER SUPPORT GROUP.

22:56.100 --> 22:59.400
EVERYONE KEPT STARING AT HER,
ASKING WHO HER DOCTOR IS.

22:59.400 --> 23:01.100
WELL, WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO?
WE GOTTA GET MOM A LIFE.

23:01.100 --> 23:03.600
WE'RE NOT GONNA BABYSIT HER
FOR THE NEXT 30 YEARS.

23:04.300 --> 23:07.800
WELL, I DO EAT
A LOT OF CHEESE.

23:07.900 --> 23:09.600
MAYBE YOU'LL ONLY
BE STUCK WITH ME FOR 20.

23:09.600 --> 23:11.200
COME ON, MOM. 
??

23:11.200 --> 23:12.500
WE'RE JUST CONCERNED
ABOUT YOU, MOM.

23:12.500 --> 23:14.200
IT SOUNDED LIKE IT.

23:14.200 --> 23:16.600
I'M SO SORRY 

23:16.600 --> 23:20.500
IF MY TRYING TO REBUILD MY LIFE
IS PUTTING A CRIMP IN YOUR SOCIAL CALENDAR.

23:20.500 --> 23:23.600
A YEAR AGO, I HAD
A HUSBAND, FRIENDS AND A LIFE.

23:23.600 --> 23:25.000
NOW, NOTHING.

23:25.000 --> 23:26.700
COME ON.
YOU STILL HAVE US.

23:27.100 --> 23:29.600
APPARENTLY NOT.
LOOK, LET'S MAKE THIS EASY.

23:29.600 --> 23:31.500
YOU KNOW HOW THE ESKIMOS
GET RID OF THEIR ELDERS?

23:31.500 --> 23:32.800
THEY JUST PUT THEM
ON AN ICE FLOE

23:32.800 --> 23:35.100
AND GIVE THEM A LITTLE WHOOSH.

23:35.100 --> 23:37.300
NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME.

23:40.500 --> 23:41.700
YOU SHOULD PROBABLY
GO TALK TO HER.

23:41.700 --> 23:43.100
YOU SHOULD GO TALK TO HER.

23:43.100 --> 23:44.100
COME ON,
YOU'RE THE DAUGHTER.

23:44.100 --> 23:45.900
WHAT IS THAT ???

23:46.900 --> 23:48.300
ROCK, PAPER, SCISSORS.

23:48.300 --> 23:50.100
AH! WHY DO I ALWAYS
DO ROCK?

23:54.500 --> 23:55.800
SO I CALLED YOU
THREE TIMES,

23:55.800 --> 23:57.700
AND NOW I'M STOPPING BY
THE OFFICE.

23:57.700 --> 24:00.800
SOME MAY SAY DESPERATE.
I'M HOPING YOU THINK CUTE.

24:01.300 --> 24:04.000
THIS ISN'T, UH,
A GOOD TIME.

24:04.300 --> 24:06.000
I DON'T KNOW
IF YOU KNOW THIS,

24:06.000 --> 24:07.700
BUT MY SISTER'S NOT
THE NICEST PERSON.

24:10.700 --> 24:13.500
I KNEW THAT HOOKING UP WITH 
YOU WOULD GET UNDER HER SKIN.

24:13.500 --> 24:15.500
SO YOU USED ME.

24:15.900 --> 24:18.700
AT FIRST, BUT THEN
I GOT TO KNOW YOU BETTER,

24:18.700 --> 24:21.700
AND IT BECAME LESS
ABOUT WILHELMINA

24:22.700 --> 24:24.000
MORE ABOUT YOU.

24:24.800 --> 24:26.600
RENEE...

24:27.200 --> 24:29.000
IT'S JUST A LITTLE
TOO WEIRD.

24:29.000 --> 24:30.700
COME ON.

24:31.600 --> 24:34.800
I PROMISE THE NEXT TIME I USE YOU,
IT'LL JUST BE FOR SEX.

24:39.500 --> 24:41.600
I'M... I'M SORRY.

24:42.300 --> 24:43.000
IT'S PROBABLY BETTER

24:43.000 --> 24:46.500
IF WE JUST FORGET
THIS EVER HAPPENED.

25:08.800 --> 25:11.300
FOUR, FIVE, SIX.

25:11.800 --> 25:13.100
FINAL TALLY--

25:13.100 --> 25:14.500
GIO--SIX,

25:14.500 --> 25:16.800
HENRY--SEVEN.

25:16.800 --> 25:18.100
YOU WIN. YAY, HENRY.

25:18.100 --> 25:19.500
OH, YEAH. SEVEN NUMBERS.

25:19.500 --> 25:20.200
WHO'S THE MAN?

25:20.200 --> 25:22.100
USUALLY NOT THE GUY
WHO SAYS, "WHO'S THE MAN?"

25:22.100 --> 25:23.500
OH, AND LOOK, 

25:23.500 --> 25:26.500
SUZIE MADE HER ZEROES 
INTO LITTLE BOOBS.

25:26.500 --> 25:28.200
SHE'S A KEEPER.

25:28.800 --> 25:30.200
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA, WHOA,
WHOA, WHOA, WHOA.

25:30.200 --> 25:31.200
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

25:31.200 --> 25:32.900
I'M THROWING THEM AWAY.GIO... 

25:32.900 --> 25:34.600
THIS WAS RESEARCH,
NOT FOR REAL.

25:34.600 --> 25:37.400
FORGET RESEARCH.
I EARNED THESE.

25:37.400 --> 25:40.300
I TOLD THAT GIRL OVER THERE
THAT I'M GOING TO IRAQ NEXT WEEK.

25:41.300 --> 25:42.700
GOTTA STRIKE NOW.

25:43.500 --> 25:44.600
CLASSY.

25:44.800 --> 25:46.800
WELL.
WHAT'D YOU THINK?

25:46.800 --> 25:47.900
I WAS PRETTY GOOD
OUT THERE, HUH?

25:47.900 --> 25:49.000
OOH, CONGRATULATIONS, HENRY.

25:49.000 --> 25:51.500
YOU MANAGED TO SET BACK
THE FEMINIST MOVEMENT 50 YEARS.

25:51.500 --> 25:53.100
HEY, IT WASN'T ME.
IT'S THAT BO.

25:53.100 --> 25:54.500
YOU'RE JUST MAD
BECAUSE IT WORKED.

25:54.500 --> 25:56.400
I'M UPSET ABOUT LOT
OF THINGS, HENRY. 

25:56.400 --> 25:57.900
LET'S JUST GO.

26:02.200 --> 26:04.800
I JUST CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS PHIL ROTH GUY WAS RIGHT.

26:05.100 --> 26:08.100
THESE POOR WOMEN,THEY'RE BEING PLAYED
AND THEY DON'T EVEN KNOW IT.

26:08.100 --> 26:09.000
AY, PLEASE, BETTY. 

26:09.000 --> 26:11.000
THEY KNOW
EXACTLY WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

26:11.000 --> 26:12.400
THEY JUST DON'T WANT
THE GUYS TO KNOW IT.

26:12.400 --> 26:13.900
THAT WAY THEY HAVE
ALL THE POWER.

26:14.600 --> 26:15.900
IT'S NOT A BAD BOOK.

26:15.900 --> 26:16.700
YOU READ IT?

26:16.700 --> 26:18.900
I THUMBED THROUGH IT.
PAPI HAS IT NOW.

26:18.900 --> 26:21.500
UGH. AND THE WORLD IS OVER.

26:21.700 --> 26:23.700
BETTY, GUYS NEED
STUFF LIKE THAT BOOK.

26:23.700 --> 26:25.500
IT GIVES THEM THE CONFIDENCE
TO TALK TO GIRLS.

26:25.500 --> 26:27.400
OTHERWISE THEY'D JUST BE
STARING AT OUR BOOBS.

26:27.400 --> 26:28.900
AND NOW THEY INSULT THEM.

26:28.900 --> 26:30.300
AT LEAST THEY'RE TALKING.

26:30.300 --> 26:32.800
SO YOU'RE ACTUALLY SAYING
THAT THIS IS A POSITIVE THING.

26:32.800 --> 26:36.100
I'M JUST SAYING
BE A LITTLE OPEN-MINDED.

26:37.700 --> 26:39.100
OH, NO.
YOU GOTTA GET THAT.

26:40.600 --> 26:41.200
DANIEL.

26:41.200 --> 26:42.600
I'M SORRY TO BOTHER YOU.

26:42.600 --> 26:44.600
I'VE JUST BEEN DRIVING AROUND
FOR HOURS,

26:45.400 --> 26:47.300
AND I DON'T REALLY KNOW
WHERE TO GO RIGHT NOW.

26:47.300 --> 26:50.500
UM, CLEARLY. YOU ARE IN
JACKSON HEIGHTS AT NIGHT, ALONE,

26:50.500 --> 26:52.500
IN A CAR THAT COST MORE
THAN THIS HOUSE.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.300
DANIEL, I'MTEMPTED
TO JUMP YOU.

26:56.100 --> 26:58.800
WHAT? YOU THINK GORGEOUS
JUST HAPPENS?

27:00.900 --> 27:02.700
I'M JUST SO CONFUSED, BETTY.

27:02.700 --> 27:05.300
SO...
IS THIS ABOUT RENEE?

27:06.000 --> 27:07.800
LOOK, I-I KNOW
SHE'S WILHELMINA'S SISTER,

27:07.800 --> 27:10.900
AND... THIS IS WRONG
IN SO MANY WAYS,

27:10.900 --> 27:12.700
BUT I CAN'T STOP
THINKING ABOUT HER.

27:17.800 --> 27:20.400
WELL, THEN MAYBE
YOU SHOULD GO FOR IT.

27:22.000 --> 27:25.300
WHAT? MAYBE I WAS WRONG
ABOUT WHAT I SAID EARLIER.

27:25.300 --> 27:28.600
I MEAN, LOOK AT HILDA.
WE ARE NOTHING ALIKE.

27:28.600 --> 27:30.200
AND YOU AND ALEXIS?

27:31.300 --> 27:33.900
WHO'S TO SAY RENEE
IS ANYTHING LIKE WILHELMINA?

27:35.000 --> 27:37.700
IF YOU REALLY LIKE HER,
THEN GIVE IT A CHANCE.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.400
WHO KNOWS
WHAT IT COULD TURN INTO?

27:50.400 --> 27:52.000
DON'T TOUCH
THE YOGURT, CHRISTINA.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.900
I DON'T EAT BREAKFAST,
BUT I HAVE IT THERE

27:53.900 --> 27:56.300
SO I KNOW
WHAT I'M DEPRIVING MYSELF OF.

27:57.400 --> 27:58.400
GOOD MORNING.

27:58.600 --> 28:00.200
SORRY, I ALREADY AGU
THE YORT.

28:01.100 --> 28:02.400
YOU CAN LICK THE SPOON
IF YOU'D LIKE.

28:02.400 --> 28:03.700
WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU DOING HERE?

28:03.700 --> 28:06.000
MM.
YOUR SISTER.

28:06.300 --> 28:08.900
THAT'S RIGHT.
WE'RE BACK TOGETHER.

28:09.900 --> 28:12.800
WE DID IT ON YOUR COUCH, TOO,
AND YOUR TABLE.

28:12.800 --> 28:16.400
OH, AND ONE MORE PLACE THAT
I'M NOT GONNA TELL YOU ABOUT.

28:16.400 --> 28:17.700
YOU'RE REALLY ENJOYING THIS,
AREN'T YOU?

28:17.700 --> 28:20.200
YOU THINK IT'S TOO EARLY 
TO START PLANNING FAMILY VACATIONS?

28:20.200 --> 28:21.700
YOU'RE A FOOL, DANIEL.

28:21.900 --> 28:24.300
YOU HAVE NO IDEA WHAT YOU'RE
GETTING YOURSELF INTO.

28:25.600 --> 28:28.700
BUT I PROMISE YOU,
YOU'LL REGRET IT.

28:55.200 --> 28:56.900
AH, I JUST FEEL LIKE
I'VE HEARD THAT BEFORE.

28:56.900 --> 28:58.100
THIS IS TOO HARD.

28:58.100 --> 28:59.200
OKAY, OKAY. 

28:59.200 --> 29:00.900
MAYBE WE NEED
TO APPROACH THIS DIFFERENTLY.

29:00.900 --> 29:03.300
IF GENE SIMMONS WERE HERE
RIGHT NOW,

29:03.500 --> 29:06.000
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY TO HIM
FROM YOUR HEART?

29:35.500 --> 29:36.900
I CAN ONLY HOPE

29:37.500 --> 29:40.300
THAT ONE DAY I'LL HAVE
AN ILLEGITIMATE DAUGHTER

29:40.300 --> 29:42.900
WHO'LL SING ME A SONG THAT'S
THAT BEAUTIFUL.

29:43.300 --> 29:44.900
OH, SWEETIE.

29:45.900 --> 29:47.900
OH, I KNOW.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.800
HEY, HAVE YOU TALKED TO MOM?
I'VE BEEN CALLING HER.

29:53.800 --> 29:55.100
NO, I TRIED HER
A COUPLE OF TIMES, TOO.

29:55.100 --> 29:56.300
SHE HASN'T CALLED ME BACK.

29:56.300 --> 29:59.000
OH, GREAT. NOW SHE'S OFF
SULKING SOMEWHERE.

29:59.100 --> 30:00.200
MAYBE WE DID
KIND OF BLOW IT.

30:00.200 --> 30:02.000
I MEAN, SHE'S ALWAYS
BEEN THERE FOR US.

30:02.300 --> 30:04.900
THAT'S TRUE. THINK OF ALL
THE NIGHTS WE WERE SICK.

30:04.900 --> 30:07.400
SHE'D STAY UP ALL NIGHT
TAKING CARE OF US.

30:07.400 --> 30:11.400
YEAH. WAIT, THAT WASN'T MOM.
THAT WAS THE NANNY.

30:11.800 --> 30:14.500
WELL, STILL, IT'S NICE
SHE HIRED SUCH A CARING NANNY.

30:14.700 --> 30:17.200
I'VE GOT NEWS FOR YOU.
SHE WASN'T THAT CARING.

30:17.200 --> 30:19.100
SHE USED TO TIE YOU
TO EACH OTHER

30:19.100 --> 30:20.400
AND GO TO THE MOVIES.

30:21.800 --> 30:23.400
I THOUGHT
THAT WAS A GAME.

30:23.400 --> 30:25.900
MOM, WHY DIDN'T YOU
RETURN OUR CALLS?

30:25.900 --> 30:27.100
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN TOO BUSY

30:27.100 --> 30:30.500
AT THAT STUPID KNITTING CLASS
YOU SIGNED ME UP FOR.

30:30.500 --> 30:31.100
HERE

30:31.100 --> 30:32.400
IT WAS GOING TO BE A SCARF

30:32.400 --> 30:34.000
UNTIL I REALIZED
HOW MUCH I HATED KNITTING.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.700
BUT THE GOOD NEWS--

30:35.700 --> 30:38.700
I FIGURED OUT WHAT I'M GOING
TO DO WITH THE REST OF MY LIFE.

30:39.400 --> 30:40.100
WHAT?

30:40.100 --> 30:41.800
THERE WERE ALL THESE WOMEN
IN THIS CLASS,

30:41.800 --> 30:43.200
AND THEY WERE JUST LIKE ME.

30:43.200 --> 30:46.500
THEIR CHILDREN WERE DONE
WITH THEM, AND THEY WERE BORED.

30:46.500 --> 30:49.100
SO I GOT TO THINKING,
WE'RE NOT DEAD YET.

30:49.100 --> 30:52.200
THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE OUT THERE
THAN KNITTING AND BINGO.

30:52.200 --> 30:57.600
SO... I'M GOING TO START
A MAGAZINE.

30:58.400 --> 30:59.500
A MAGAZINE?

30:59.500 --> 31:01.300
IT'S FOR WOMEN
OF A CERTAIN AGE

31:01.300 --> 31:04.200
WHO AREN'T READY
FOR THAT ICE FLOE.

31:04.500 --> 31:06.700
I'M GOING CALL IT...

31:06.700 --> 31:07.900
"HOT FLASH."

31:10.000 --> 31:10.900
MOM...

31:10.900 --> 31:12.600
I-I THINK IT'S GREAT THAT
YOU'RE TRYING TO KEEP BUSY,

31:12.600 --> 31:15.400
BUT STARTING UP A MAGAZINE
ISN'T THAT SIMPLE.

31:15.400 --> 31:17.300
OH, DARLING, DO YOU THINK
I WAS MARRIED TO YOUR FATHER

31:17.300 --> 31:18.800
FOR ALL THOSE YEARS
WITHOUT LEARNING A THING 

31:18.800 --> 31:20.100
OR TWO ABOUT THIS BUSINESS?

31:20.500 --> 31:23.600
I'M GOING TO NEED AN ASSISTANT,
A FULL-TIME PRODUCTION STAFF,

31:23.600 --> 31:25.800
A SUITE OF OFFICES--
THE SEVENTH FLOOR WILL BE FINE.

31:25.800 --> 31:28.600
-MOM
-AND I'M GOING TO NEED SOME START-UP CAPITAL.

31:29.400 --> 31:33.000
LET'S SEE HOW LONG
$2 MILLION LASTS ME.

31:33.000 --> 31:34.300
MAYBE WE SHOULD
HAVE DINNER FIRST

31:34.300 --> 31:35.300
AND JUST TALK ABOUT THIS.

31:35.300 --> 31:38.700
I'D LOVE TO, KIDS,
BUT I DON'T HAVE TIME.

31:38.700 --> 31:39.900
TOODLES.

31:42.400 --> 31:43.700
-"HOT FLASH."
-"HOT FLASH."

31:44.600 --> 31:46.100
OH, I'D TAP THAT.

31:46.800 --> 31:48.200
HELLO, MR. ROTH.

31:49.000 --> 31:50.400
THANK YOU FOR...

31:50.400 --> 31:52.900
MEETING WITH ME... 
AGAIN.

31:52.900 --> 31:55.100
I'VE SEEN YOUR BOOK
IN ACTION,

31:55.100 --> 31:58.400
AND AS HARD AS THIS IS
FOR ME TO ADMIT,

31:59.000 --> 32:02.200
IT ACTUALLY WORKS...
ON SOME GIRLS.

32:03.300 --> 32:04.500
WOW.

32:05.000 --> 32:07.800
THAT IS REALLY COOL OF YOU
TO ADMIT THAT.

32:07.800 --> 32:10.900
YOU KNOW, SMART GIRLS
USUALLY DON'T GET IT.

32:11.500 --> 32:12.600
RIGHT.
WELL, 

32:12.600 --> 32:15.700
YOU CAN REST ASSURED THAT 
THE ARTICLE WILL BE TOTALLY UNBIASED,

32:15.700 --> 32:18.400
AND YOU SHOULD ALSO KNOW
THAT YOUR CONCERNS

32:18.400 --> 32:21.600
WERE COMPLETELY UNWARRANTED.

32:21.800 --> 32:23.000
WHAT C-CONCERNS?

32:23.000 --> 32:25.200
YOU KNOW, THE ONES
YOU EXPRESSED TO DANIEL

32:25.200 --> 32:28.600
ABOUT ME NOT BEING OPEN-MINDED 
ENOUGH TO WRITE THIS ARTICLE.

32:28.600 --> 32:29.700
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

32:29.700 --> 32:30.900
'CAUSE I-I NEVER S--
I NEVER SAID THAT.

32:30.900 --> 32:31.700
WHAT?

32:31.700 --> 32:34.100
MNH-MNH.
NO, DANIEL SAID THAT YOU--

32:34.100 --> 32:35.100
UH-OH.

32:36.300 --> 32:38.400
MAYBE YOU'RE NOT SO SMART
AFTER ALL.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.900
SOUNDS LIKE
SOMEBODY GOT PLAYED.

32:46.400 --> 32:48.800
GOOD MORNING, DANIEL.
I GOT YOU A TREAT.

32:48.900 --> 32:50.000
CINNAMON TWIST!

32:50.000 --> 32:51.100
I LOVE CINNAMON TWISTS.

32:51.100 --> 32:52.400
WELL,
YOU'RE NOT GETTING IT.

32:52.700 --> 32:54.300
DO WE ALWAYS
HAVE TO PLAY THESE GAMES

32:54.300 --> 32:55.100
WHEN YOU'RE MAD AT ME?

32:55.100 --> 32:57.300
OH, YOU'RE ONE
TO TALK ABOUT GAMES.

32:57.300 --> 32:59.800
LET'S SEE, YOU TOLD ME
THAT PHIL ROTH SAID

32:59.800 --> 33:03.300
I WAS CLOSED-MINDED,
BUT HE NEVER SAID THAT.

33:03.500 --> 33:05.000
OKAY, YES, YOU'RE RIGHT.

33:05.000 --> 33:07.100
CAN I PLEASE HAVE
THE CINNAMON TWIST?

33:07.200 --> 33:08.600
NO. IS THAT IT?
THAT'S ALL?

33:08.600 --> 33:10.800
YOU'RE NOT EVEN GONNA TRY
TO DENY IT?

33:10.800 --> 33:12.400
LOOK, I SAID IT BECAUSE I
COULDN'T THINK OF ANYTHING ELSE

33:12.400 --> 33:13.700
TO GET YOU
TO WRITE THE ARTICLE.

33:13.700 --> 33:14.900
WHAT?

33:14.900 --> 33:17.100
BETTY, YOU WERE QUITTING
BECAUSE YOU WERE UNCOMFORTABLE.

33:17.300 --> 33:18.600
NOW IF YOU WANT TO BE
A REAL WRITER,

33:18.600 --> 33:21.200
YOU CAN'T ALWAYS WRITE ABOUT
YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD

33:21.200 --> 33:23.200
AND YOUR FAMILY
AND--AND KITTENS.

33:23.200 --> 33:25.200
WELL, WHAT'S WRONG
WITH WRITING ABOUT THAT?

33:25.200 --> 33:28.100
THAT'S WHAT I KNOW.
AND WHO DOESN'T LIKE KITTENS?

33:28.100 --> 33:29.900
THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH
WRITING ABOUT WHAT YOU KNOW.

33:29.900 --> 33:32.700
I'M JUST SAYING YOU SHOULD
TRY TO KNOW MORE,

33:32.700 --> 33:34.000
STEP OUTSIDE
YOUR COMFORT ZONE.

33:34.000 --> 33:35.100
AND YOU DID.

33:35.100 --> 33:38.700
BETTY, YOUR ARTICLE--
IT'S GOOD.

33:38.900 --> 33:41.300
REALLY?
YOU LIKED IT?

33:41.300 --> 33:42.100
YEAH.

33:42.100 --> 33:44.100
I'M GETTING PUBLISHED?

33:44.100 --> 33:47.500
ACTUALLY, UH, YOU'RE NOT
GETTING PUBLISHED.

33:47.500 --> 33:48.400
WHY?

33:48.400 --> 33:49.600
ALEXIS PULLED THE STORY.

33:49.600 --> 33:52.400
I GUESS WHEN SHE WAS A GUY
SHE LOVED PHIL ROTH,

33:52.400 --> 33:54.900
AND AS A WOMAN, SHE THINKS
HE'S KIND OF A PIG.

33:54.900 --> 33:57.400
OH! YOU'RE KIDDING ME,
RIGHT?

33:57.400 --> 33:58.500
I'M SORRY.

33:58.800 --> 34:01.500
BUT YOU DID DO
A FANTASTIC JOB.

34:01.500 --> 34:03.000
AND I PROMISE,

34:03.000 --> 34:05.800
THERE'S GONNA BE
OTHER ASSIGNMENTS,BETTER ONES.

34:06.500 --> 34:07.600
ALL RIGHT.

34:07.900 --> 34:09.900
THIS TOTALLY SUCKS.

34:11.400 --> 34:13.100
BUT, DANIEL, THANK YOU

34:14.100 --> 34:15.900
FOR HAVING FAITH IN ME.

34:21.800 --> 34:23.100
THANK YOU.

34:26.800 --> 34:28.699
WHY ARE YOU DOING
LONG DIVISION?

34:29.100 --> 34:30.500
IT CALMS ME.

34:31.500 --> 34:33.500
DO NOT BE NERVOUS 
ABOUT THE BAND TONIGHT.

34:33.500 --> 34:37.000
THERE IS NO WAY THAT AMANDA 
COULD POSSIBLY BE WORSE THAN CLYDE.

34:37.800 --> 34:39.400
I CAN ASK HILDA
TO COME WITH.

34:39.800 --> 34:41.000
OH, AND I CAN CALL GIO.

34:41.000 --> 34:43.000
HE'LL BRING ONE OF THOSE GIRLS
HE MET AT THE BAR.

34:44.400 --> 34:46.100
OH, YOU KNOW,
 I'M GOOD.

34:46.100 --> 34:47.800
I PUT UP A LOT OF POSTERS
IN THE VILLAGE.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.600
YEAH, BUT IF HE BRINGS SOMEONE,
THEN THAT'S 20 EXTRA BUCKS.

34:53.800 --> 34:55.699
HENRY, ARE YOU SERIOUS?

34:56.000 --> 34:58.700
LO, YOU CANNOT BE
SO COMPETITIVE WITH HIM.

34:58.700 --> 34:59.900
I HAVE TO BE.

35:01.100 --> 35:02.200
WHY?

35:02.200 --> 35:04.500
BECAUSE, BETTY,
HE'S ALWAYS AROUND,

35:04.500 --> 35:06.900
AND I TRUST YOU COMPLETELY.

35:06.900 --> 35:08.300
I JUST DON'T TRUST HIM.

35:08.300 --> 35:11.000
SO WHAT, YOU THINK
HE'S GONNA WALK OVER

35:11.000 --> 35:12.500
AND KNOCK ME ON THE HEAD
WITH A CLUB

35:12.500 --> 35:14.000
AND DRAG ME BACK
TO HIS CAVE?

35:14.000 --> 35:15.700
I DO HAVE SOME SAY IN IT.

35:15.700 --> 35:16.900
IT'S JUST HARD.

35:17.600 --> 35:19.400
LOOK, DO YOU REMEMBER
HOW YOU FELT AT THE BAR

35:19.400 --> 35:20.900
WATCHING ME
HIT ON ALL THOSE WOMEN?

35:21.900 --> 35:25.000
THAT'S HOW I FEEL EVERY TIME
I SEE GIO AROUND YOU.

35:25.600 --> 35:28.900
WELL... I HATE
THAT YOU FEEL THAT WAY.

35:29.400 --> 35:31.800
I'M SORRY.
I HATE IT, TOO.

35:34.500 --> 35:37.500
LOOK,I-I DON'T WANT ANYTHING 
TO GET IN THE WAY

35:37.500 --> 35:40.100
OF THE LITTLE TIME
THAT WE HAVE LEFT TOGETHER.

35:40.600 --> 35:42.400
I JUST WON'T
SEE HIM ANYMORE.

35:42.700 --> 35:44.500
NOW I FEEL STUPID.

35:44.800 --> 35:46.900
I KNOW HOW MUCH YOU LOVE
HIS CHICKEN SALAD.

35:46.900 --> 35:49.800
YEAH,
BUT I LOVE YOU MORE.

35:53.700 --> 35:56.300
YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO MAKE
CHICKEN SALAD, THOUGH,WON'T YOU?

35:58.200 --> 35:59.800
OKAY, REMEMBER,
LOOK INTO THE CAMERA,

35:59.800 --> 36:02.200
AVOID YOUR BAD ANGLES,
AND I DID EVERYTHING I COULD,

36:02.200 --> 36:03.500
BUT THIS LIGHTING
IS NOT YOUR FRIEND.

36:03.500 --> 36:04.800
MARC, 
I'M REALLY NERVOUS.

36:04.800 --> 36:07.800
HEY. YOU HAVE NOTHING
TO BE NERVOUS ABOUT.

36:07.800 --> 36:10.000
EXCEPT FOR YOUR VOICE,
YOU'RE A GREAT SINGER.

36:10.600 --> 36:11.900
-READY?
-YEAH.

36:11.900 --> 36:13.800
HELLO,
 BEER HOLE.

36:13.800 --> 36:16.800
ARE YOU READY TO ROCK
AND/OR ROLL?

36:19.000 --> 36:20.100
OKAY, GO.

36:22.900 --> 36:25.000
THIS ONE
GOES OUT TO YOU, DADDY.

36:25.900 --> 36:28.100
IT'S MANDY, BITCH.

36:52.900 --> 36:55.000
EXCUSE ME, MA'AM.
YOU'RE IN MY WAY.

36:56.000 --> 36:59.300
DO YOU MIND?
SHE'S SINGING ABOUT ME.

36:59.300 --> 37:01.600
NO. SHE'S SINGING ABOUT
GENE SIMMONS.

38:00.600 --> 38:01.600
DADDY?

38:02.200 --> 38:03.800
-DAUGHTER?
-AMANDA.

38:03.800 --> 38:05.700
-AMANDA.
-I CAN'BELIEVE YOU CAME.

38:05.700 --> 38:07.100
HOW DID YOU KNOW
WE WERE DOING THIS?

38:07.100 --> 38:09.000
OH, I GOOGLE MYSELF
EVERY MORNING.

38:09.000 --> 38:10.200
ME, TOO.

38:10.300 --> 38:12.900
YOU KNOW, THE DETAIL OF
THAT SONG, IT WAS SPOT-ON.

38:12.900 --> 38:14.600
YOU CAN'T FORGET
A NIGHT LIKE THAT,

38:14.600 --> 38:16.200
OR A WOMAN LIKE FEY.

38:16.200 --> 38:18.800
MAN, CHER WAS SO PISSED OFF.

38:19.500 --> 38:23.400
SO IT'S TRUE.
YOU'RE MY FATHER.

38:24.100 --> 38:27.200
OH, MY GOD.
I FOUND YOU.

38:33.100 --> 38:34.300
I'LL TELL YOU WHAT,

38:34.300 --> 38:36.800
LET'S GET OUTTA HERE.
MAYBE WE'LL CATCH UP?

38:36.800 --> 38:39.000
I KNOW WE BOTH HAVE
SOME QUESTIONS. COME ON.

38:39.000 --> 38:39.800
OKAY

38:43.200 --> 38:45.500
WHERE IS AMANDA GOING
???

38:45.500 --> 38:46.700
WHO'S GONNA SING?

38:46.700 --> 38:49.200
HENRY!
 YOU!

38:49.200 --> 38:51.400
ARE YOU KIDDING?
ON STAGE, ALONE?

38:51.400 --> 38:52.600
WELL, WHAT, 
ARE YOU AFRAID?

38:52.600 --> 38:55.100
YES. YES, I AM AFRAID.
I'M TERRIFIED.

38:55.100 --> 38:57.800
WELL, THEN ALL THE MORE REASON
FOR YOU TO DO IT.

38:57.800 --> 38:59.500
IT'LL BE GOOD FOR YOU.

38:59.700 --> 39:01.500
THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY
THAT I'M DOING THIS.

40:06.400 --> 40:08.600
OH, 
DON'T WAIT UP.

40:08.600 --> 40:10.700
I'M HAVING DRINKS
WITH DANIEL.

40:10.700 --> 40:13.200
YOU KNOW, IF YOU REALLY WANT
TO MAKE IT WORK WITH DANIEL,

40:13.200 --> 40:15.400
IT'S GONNA REQUIRE
A BIT OF HONESTY.

40:16.000 --> 40:18.300
I CERTAINLY HOPE
HE NEVER DISCOVERS...

40:18.300 --> 40:20.000
THE TRUTH ABOUT YOU.
