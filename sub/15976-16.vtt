WEBVTT

00:05.281 --> 00:06.695
That were not just
blowing smoke.

00:06.708 --> 00:08.166
We would love to
work with you.

00:08.191 --> 00:10.049
And not just because your
motel chain

00:10.068 --> 00:11.594
is the largest independently
on the country.

00:11.613 --> 00:14.285
This Bainbridge motels are
part of this country's history.

00:14.302 --> 00:16.429
- My sister's wedding.
- Friendly vacation.

00:16.461 --> 00:17.731
After school job.

00:17.762 --> 00:19.218
Magical prom.

00:19.220 --> 00:21.186
Okay. Flammable.

00:21.188 --> 00:22.855
Pressed wood. Bedbugs.

00:22.857 --> 00:24.890
I have no illusions
about my motels.

00:24.892 --> 00:27.259
They're small, they're cheap
and, until last week,

00:27.261 --> 00:29.094
they were safe
from bear attacks.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.696
Good, 'cause we were
blowing a lot of smoke.

00:30.698 --> 00:33.131
No, I know! I can see that!
Honesty time, everybody.

00:33.133 --> 00:35.534
Lost my virginity.
Got drunk and barfed.

00:35.536 --> 00:37.302
Roofied my math teacher.

00:37.304 --> 00:38.971
Wow.
I never went to prom.

00:38.973 --> 00:40.005
Oh, kitten.
Well, this is

00:40.007 --> 00:42.708
a good group. I like you guys.

00:42.710 --> 00:45.177
I have to be honest: I am
meeting with other agencies.

00:45.179 --> 00:47.412
We encourage that. Get out there and
listen to other pitches.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.781
We want you to choose
your agency based on merit.

00:49.783 --> 00:52.417
You're joking. Of course I am.
Choose us 'cause we're pretty.

00:52.419 --> 00:55.754
No, the emcee for my son's
bar mitzvah just canceled.

00:55.756 --> 00:58.723
His wife went into premature
labor and blah, blah, blah.

00:58.725 --> 01:00.091
This is a disaster.

01:00.093 --> 01:01.993
No, it's not, Beth.
Look no further.

01:01.995 --> 01:05.297
I happen to know the best bar
mitzvah emcee in all of Chicago.

01:05.299 --> 01:06.731
You do?
Mm-hmm.

01:08.302 --> 01:11.069
So let me hear where
my real chosen people are at!

01:12.406 --> 01:14.072
Yeah, and now

01:14.074 --> 01:16.241
put your hands together
for my main man,

01:16.243 --> 01:19.477
S-S-S-S-Sam Silverberg!

01:21.000 --> 01:27.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:28.981 --> 01:31.222
All right, they're feeling it.
DJ, cut the music,

01:31.224 --> 01:34.092
cut the music. It's time to dig
into those pre-plated salads,

01:34.094 --> 01:36.661
everybody. And, remember,
if you want Dr. Z

01:36.663 --> 01:40.398
to visit your bar mitzvah,
clean your plates.

01:40.400 --> 01:41.866
You called yourself
Dr. Z?

01:41.868 --> 01:45.269
I like you in sequins. No.
No, no, no, no. No, no.

01:45.271 --> 01:47.472
We're not just skating over
this tragic geek bomb

01:47.474 --> 01:49.407
that's just landed in our laps.
It's not a big deal.

01:49.409 --> 01:52.076
I thought I told you about this. I
used to be a bar mitzvah emcee Oh, oh,

01:52.078 --> 01:54.145
and... Yeah. really? I think I actually...
I would've remembered this.

01:54.147 --> 01:56.414
No. I am no advocate
of bullying,

01:56.416 --> 01:59.450
but our friend right here needs
to be mercilessly

01:59.452 --> 02:00.651
tortured by his peers
right now.

02:00.653 --> 02:02.620
Am I right? I am right.
Who's gonna start?

02:02.622 --> 02:03.788
I guess I'm gonna start.
Andrew, Andrew.

02:03.790 --> 02:05.756
I'm sorry, but he was magnificent.
Hmm.

02:05.758 --> 02:08.860
I knew the moment I met
him, he was a star.

02:08.862 --> 02:09.860
You're amazing.

02:09.863 --> 02:11.629
Whose uncle is this?

02:11.631 --> 02:13.564
I'm a Gentile. Happy to be here.
Token goy.

02:13.566 --> 02:15.299
All right.
I want to make you an offer.

02:15.301 --> 02:16.901
Oh.

02:16.903 --> 02:18.469
I just thought he was hitting on me.
Oh...

02:18.471 --> 02:21.172
Dad, are we really gonna pimp
Zach out to land a client?

02:21.174 --> 02:23.240
I mean, what happened
to getting it on our own merit?

02:23.242 --> 02:25.343
Syd, that was a big part of the
biz back in the day. It was fun.

02:25.345 --> 02:26.777
Wooing, schmoozing clients,

02:26.779 --> 02:29.146
getting them to sign before they
passed out on a pile of blow.

02:29.148 --> 02:31.048
Oh, those were the days.
It's sweet

02:31.050 --> 02:33.584
when he stumbles down memory lane.
Yeah. It's adorable.

02:33.586 --> 02:35.586
Sydney, it's a motel chain.
It's a year's work for everyone.

02:35.588 --> 02:37.221
And if we get a second one
and people land on it,

02:37.223 --> 02:38.689
they'll have to pay
us a lot of money.

02:38.691 --> 02:41.659
Wait, that's <i> Monopoly.</i>
But the same rules apply.

02:41.661 --> 02:43.661
What do you say?
Are you in, Race Car?

02:47.266 --> 02:50.167
Here's the thing. Um,
Highland Park has a-a Mm-hmm.

02:50.169 --> 02:51.669
Pretty tight Jewish community.

02:51.671 --> 02:53.804
And it-it might be tricky
to run into some people.

02:53.806 --> 02:57.107
Some people? Just how many Jewish
girls in Highland Park had

02:57.109 --> 02:59.576
to have their "Zach" tattoo
covered with a butterfly? Oh,

02:59.578 --> 03:01.578
fun fact: Jews don't usually
get tattoos.

03:01.580 --> 03:02.813
Another fun fact:

03:02.815 --> 03:04.848
an uncircumcised penis
looks like a dog in a snood.

03:04.850 --> 03:05.983
Really?
There's just

03:05.985 --> 03:07.951
this one girl, a singer.
Please.

03:07.953 --> 03:11.188
As this old rabbi once said
to me, "Women, feh!"

03:11.190 --> 03:12.422
Eh.
Come on.

03:12.424 --> 03:13.590
It's for the agency, Zach.

03:13.592 --> 03:14.992
You're not gonna let me down,
are you, son?

03:14.994 --> 03:17.027
Let you down?
No.

03:17.029 --> 03:18.495
Feh!

03:18.497 --> 03:20.964
Hey! Is he a mensch?

03:20.966 --> 03:23.100
Give me that <i> punim!</i>

03:41.920 --> 03:43.553
- Beth, I promise you,
- Mm-hmm.

03:43.555 --> 03:45.422
If you use Zachary
as your bar mitzvah emcee,

03:45.424 --> 03:47.123
you'll be the
talk of this town.

03:47.125 --> 03:48.925
Some warm brie? I
think it's kosher.

03:48.927 --> 03:51.494
- Thank you. Well, my son's
name is Noah. - Okay.

03:51.496 --> 03:53.263
We'll get to him. He sounds
great. And it's just gonna be

03:53.265 --> 03:55.565
a real special night for all
of us. My first question is:

03:55.567 --> 03:57.100
who is your bar mitzvah singer?

03:57.102 --> 03:59.336
- Mmm.
- Ooh, I can't remember her name.

03:59.338 --> 04:01.104
If you can try.
We just want to make sure

04:01.106 --> 04:02.038
that you have the best.

04:02.040 --> 04:04.007
- Zoe Gold.
- Oh, God.

04:04.009 --> 04:06.376
Zoe Gold's the best.
We couldn't get her.

04:06.378 --> 04:08.878
- Oh, sorry. That's great.
- I was

04:08.880 --> 04:12.182
furious. I mentioned Zoe
to Jennifer Blume,

04:12.184 --> 04:13.783
and she booked her
for her daughter's bat mitzvah

04:13.785 --> 04:15.785
the very same night.
So unfair.

04:15.787 --> 04:17.754
She already got the good hall.

04:17.755 --> 04:19.856
I can't stand Jennifer Blume
or her chubby daughter.

04:19.858 --> 04:22.459
- It's terrible how big that
child is getting. - She blew up.

04:22.461 --> 04:23.593
The whole <i> mishpocheh's</i> gigantic.

04:23.595 --> 04:25.328
Let's get
to the most important thing.

04:25.330 --> 04:26.429
What's our theme?

04:26.431 --> 04:28.831
Well, after lots
of tears and arguments,

04:28.833 --> 04:31.501
my son and I finally
compromised on...

04:31.503 --> 04:34.437
"Noah Loves Chicago."

04:34.439 --> 04:35.471
I love it!

04:35.473 --> 04:36.472
Never been done before!

04:36.474 --> 04:38.408
Beth, Beth, Beth,
wait, wait a minute.

04:38.410 --> 04:41.511
I just had a vision. Hold on.

04:41.513 --> 04:43.112
We'll have the bar mitzvah here.

04:43.114 --> 04:45.581
How 'bout that? "Noah
Loves Chicago." In here?

04:45.583 --> 04:47.316
He'll be looking out
on all of it!

04:47.318 --> 04:49.118
And I will not have
his sacred night held

04:49.120 --> 04:50.686
in some dank, dark basement.

04:50.688 --> 04:52.255
Well, that's where
he was conceived.

04:53.191 --> 04:54.290
I'm kidding!

04:54.292 --> 04:56.092
It was in one of
my fleabag motels.

04:56.094 --> 04:57.326
I forgot you even had motels.

04:57.328 --> 04:58.361
Some more expensive champagne?

04:58.363 --> 04:59.395
Oh, well, I really shouldn't.

04:59.397 --> 05:00.663
Oh, yes, you should.
Yes!

05:00.665 --> 05:02.198
Now we do bar mitzvahs?

05:02.200 --> 05:03.266
Yeah.  What's next?

05:03.268 --> 05:05.134
Renting out this place
for a sorority party,

05:05.136 --> 05:06.969
having a butt-chugging station
in the corner?

05:06.971 --> 05:08.904
Fun fact: it's the best way
to get a buzz

05:08.906 --> 05:10.806
without all the unwanted calories.
Sydney,

05:10.808 --> 05:12.241
that's how we'll land
this account. We take

05:12.243 --> 05:13.676
all the responsibility
for the party,

05:13.678 --> 05:15.378
we get all the credit
for creating the greatest moment

05:15.380 --> 05:16.379
in little Noah's life.

05:16.381 --> 05:17.680
She will so owe us.

05:17.682 --> 05:19.382
I do want a motel.

05:19.384 --> 05:20.316
Syd, come on.

05:20.318 --> 05:21.484
Check me out.
Look at me now.

05:21.486 --> 05:22.818
Sparkle vest.

05:22.820 --> 05:24.453
What's up?
Ooh, robot.

05:24.455 --> 05:25.821
- That's kind of sexy.
- What's going on?

05:25.823 --> 05:28.557
No, no. Fun is fun.
I forbid you to wear this out.

05:28.559 --> 05:30.860
- It's a great vest. - I didn't
raise you to wear sequins.

05:30.862 --> 05:34.096
Life is good. Zach's gonna land us a motel
chain while wearing a sparkly vest.

05:34.098 --> 05:35.865
My heart is full,
my <i> pupik</i> is an outie.

05:35.867 --> 05:38.434
We are gonna party
like it's 5078.

05:38.436 --> 05:40.402
Sydney. ♪ Hora ♪

05:40.404 --> 05:43.973

that funky hora ♪

05:43.975 --> 05:47.576

love to do, hey! ♪

05:50.508 --> 05:53.109
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen!

05:53.111 --> 05:56.913
I'm your emcee, Dr. Z,
and tonight's prognosis

05:56.915 --> 06:00.283
is fun! Now, I'm here
with my party peppers

06:00.285 --> 06:03.019
to take this party to a
whole new level! But before

06:03.021 --> 06:05.355
we go any further,
I need everybody

06:05.357 --> 06:06.656
to get up out of those seats

06:06.658 --> 06:10.727
and come join us right here
on the dance floor!

06:10.729 --> 06:13.029
Come on, party peppers,
let's go!

06:13.031 --> 06:14.931
All right, Aunt Sadie.

06:14.933 --> 06:16.800
Twerk it, girl! Show me
what you workin' with.

06:16.802 --> 06:18.334
What does he want me to do?

06:18.336 --> 06:21.471
He wants you to twerk
it, Aunt Sadie!

06:21.473 --> 06:23.273
Come on, peppers...

06:23.275 --> 06:24.541
Let it rain, Jonah!

06:24.543 --> 06:26.242
Oh!

06:26.244 --> 06:27.243
You're next, Seymour.

06:27.245 --> 06:30.513
Simon, you really went all out.

06:30.515 --> 06:34.350
Oh, I can't wait to see the look
on Jennifer Blume's face-lift.

06:34.352 --> 06:36.552
Hard to tell with her.
She always looks surprised.

06:36.554 --> 06:38.554
Did you see the hall hockey?
We have a signed stick

06:38.556 --> 06:40.690
that Patrick Kane used
in the hockey ball super game.

06:40.692 --> 06:42.258
Stanley Cup.
Oh. Do you know sports?

06:42.260 --> 06:44.193
- Not really. - Oh, good.
Check this out.

06:44.195 --> 06:46.629
The kids are taking selfies
and live-streaming.

06:48.699 --> 06:51.033
Old people.

06:51.035 --> 06:53.436
And delete.

06:53.438 --> 06:55.204
There's a really cute guy
over there.

06:55.206 --> 06:58.407
I thought you had, like,
a "no facial hair" policy

06:58.409 --> 06:59.642
on that list of yours.

06:59.644 --> 07:01.711
I don't have a list.
Mmm...

07:01.713 --> 07:03.646
Okay, maybe I have a list that
I might possibly have amended

07:03.648 --> 07:05.081
recently to include facial hair.

07:05.083 --> 07:06.782
Well, you're expanding your
horizons, and I'm very proud

07:06.784 --> 07:08.284
of you. Well, if you're
really proud of me,

07:08.286 --> 07:10.386
then make yourself scarce
'cause he's coming this way.

07:10.388 --> 07:11.821
Feed the big dog, Jonah!
Hi.

07:11.823 --> 07:14.156
Was it you or that dude
that was checking out my tank?

07:14.158 --> 07:16.726
I'm not judging. I just want to
know who to give my number to.

07:16.728 --> 07:19.261
That might have been me.

07:19.263 --> 07:21.530
Is one of these kids yours? Or
are you, like, the hot cousin?

07:21.532 --> 07:23.999
Hoping for hot cousin.
I'll take hot cousin.

07:24.001 --> 07:25.434
Am I charming you right now?
I feel like I'm charming you

07:25.436 --> 07:27.570
right now. A little bit. A
little bit, yeah. Maybe you want

07:27.572 --> 07:29.805
to take my number now, though. You know,
just in case you're gonna mess it up.

07:29.807 --> 07:32.408
How did you know that's what I do?
Did I hit on you already tonight?

07:32.410 --> 07:34.343
Sydney, can you please
explain to the bartender

07:34.345 --> 07:37.713
that he can serve 13-year-olds
because they're technically men?

07:37.715 --> 07:40.449
I will talk to the bartender.

07:40.451 --> 07:43.485
And you... don't.

07:43.862 --> 07:46.422
I should probably
take care of that.

07:46.424 --> 07:49.191
Yeah, I think you should. You
want to get a drink after this?

07:49.193 --> 07:51.493
Yeah. I would like that.

07:51.495 --> 07:52.561
I'll find you.

07:52.563 --> 07:56.331
I'll be working all night.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.533
You want to watch it
while I walk away?

07:57.535 --> 07:58.534
Check it out.

07:58.536 --> 08:01.870
You like waiter butt, huh?

08:01.872 --> 08:03.172
It's good, right?

08:04.140 --> 08:06.975
And now the guy who wowed
Temple Shir Tikvah

08:06.977 --> 08:09.311
when he sang the haftorah
with no vowels,

08:09.313 --> 08:13.615
put your hands together
for my main man, Noah!

08:15.419 --> 08:18.520
Swarovski, bitches!

08:18.522 --> 08:20.555
Well, that's new information.
Mm-hmm.

08:22.192 --> 08:24.760
When I agreed
to "Noah Loves Chicago,"

08:24.762 --> 08:26.194
I meant the musical.

08:26.196 --> 08:28.063
I will put on a brave face,

08:28.065 --> 08:30.265
but I am not happy, Beth.

08:31.234 --> 08:34.535
That is one tough broad.

08:34.538 --> 08:37.239
I think maybe I pushed the theme
in the wrong direction.

08:37.241 --> 08:38.640
Oh, Noah's so hard to please.

08:38.642 --> 08:39.841
Really?
But, Simon,

08:39.842 --> 08:41.943
Mm-hmm. if this party
is any indication

08:41.945 --> 08:43.945
of how you'll handle
my account, Uh-huh.

08:43.947 --> 08:46.214
Well, then...

08:46.216 --> 08:48.717
Suspenseful.

08:52.697 --> 08:55.257
I hate to be that person,
but should you be doing that?

08:55.259 --> 08:56.791
Yeah, I know. I try
to stay away from dairy,

08:56.793 --> 08:58.560
but these things are crazy good.
I stashed a bunch

08:58.562 --> 08:59.594
in a drawer in that office.

08:59.596 --> 09:01.129
W... But that's my office.

09:01.131 --> 09:03.365
Well, then I know who to
blame if any of them are gone.

09:03.367 --> 09:04.966
You got to try one.

09:04.968 --> 09:06.835
No, I don't want one.
Come on!

09:06.837 --> 09:09.137
Be adventurous. You don't try
things. That's your problem.

09:09.139 --> 09:11.673
I don't have a problem. You got a whole
drawer full of stolen appetizers.

09:11.675 --> 09:13.007
I'd say you got all
kinds of problems.

09:13.009 --> 09:14.709
Ants, at the very least.

09:14.711 --> 09:16.444
Try it.
No, don't feed me, okay?

09:16.446 --> 09:18.246
Feed the other people.
A-And if you feel the need

09:18.248 --> 09:20.415
to feed yourself... I don't
know... maybe try new food.

09:20.417 --> 09:22.917
You got a problem with
recycling? Don't bring your beef

09:22.919 --> 09:25.587
with Mother Earth
into Noah's special day.

09:25.589 --> 09:27.055
Let me ask you something.

09:27.057 --> 09:28.590
We still having
that drink later?

09:28.592 --> 09:30.058
No.

09:30.060 --> 09:31.259
'Cause I'm a waiter?

09:31.261 --> 09:32.627
No.

09:32.629 --> 09:34.295
Because you're a bad waiter.

09:36.066 --> 09:37.732
Hey. Eyes up here.

the blessing over the bread,

09:49.712 --> 09:51.612

I love it, it's like a "Chicken

09:58.621 --> 10:00.721
Exactly. All right, now,
where's my singer? Oh, wow.

10:00.723 --> 10:02.323
- The band started. - Good news.
On this holy day,

10:02.325 --> 10:04.892
God chose to give Jennifer
Blume's daughter appendicitis.

10:04.894 --> 10:06.193

What, did she stalk you?

Please tell me she sent you

10:42.732 --> 10:44.565

11:01.417 --> 11:02.783
What?

11:02.785 --> 11:04.284
I stand here astonished.
All right,

11:04.286 --> 11:06.053
not only were you
a bar mitzvah geek,

11:06.055 --> 11:09.089
but you were also a big baby over a girl.
You've got levels. Levels.

11:09.091 --> 11:11.625
Oh, my God. I was such a wreck
when she broke up with me,

11:11.627 --> 11:13.594
I didn't wash my hair for
three days. Except for maybe

11:13.596 --> 11:15.062
some dry shampoo and
a little product.

11:15.064 --> 11:16.763
How long is your regime?
I just wanted to know why,

11:16.765 --> 11:19.333
you know? Why would she break
up with me when it was perfect?

11:19.335 --> 11:21.435
- We were so in love. And then...
-  it's over.

11:21.437 --> 11:23.336
It's like I'm back there, right now.
I need to know why.

11:23.338 --> 11:25.639
I'm gonna go out there, I got
to find out... No, you are not.

11:25.641 --> 11:27.674
You do not want to know why.
There is no good answer

11:27.676 --> 11:29.743
to that question. Zach,
what are you doing in here?

11:29.745 --> 11:30.977
The Jews are wandering.

11:30.979 --> 11:32.946
I need my Moses.
It's getting biblical out there.

11:32.948 --> 11:35.982
I'm running out of mazel! Don't you leave
me out there with my schmekel in my hand.

11:35.984 --> 11:37.484
You want to get through this?

11:37.486 --> 11:40.253
Yeah. Forget she's out there.
You don't look her in the eye.

11:40.255 --> 11:41.288
That'll just
light the flame anew.

11:41.290 --> 11:43.590
No eye contact.
You come with me, okay?

11:43.592 --> 11:45.392
You act as cool as a freak
sideways-moonwalking

11:45.394 --> 11:47.560
in sequin socks thinks he can be.
All right.

11:47.562 --> 11:50.497
Hey, good moves on that
dance floor, kid.

11:50.499 --> 11:51.898
That's my Zach Cropper.

11:54.177 --> 11:56.737
Let me get this straight.
You fired Facial Hair

11:56.739 --> 11:58.171
because you didn't want
to go out with him?

11:58.173 --> 11:59.740
No, she fired him
because he was a waiter.

11:59.742 --> 12:01.942
Oh, I see what you're saying.

12:01.944 --> 12:03.677
Why are you guys talking
about me like I'm not here?

12:03.679 --> 12:04.845
Well, because we
don't want to call you

12:04.847 --> 12:06.646
- a snob to your face.
- Not at a party.

12:06.648 --> 12:09.049
I am not a snob.
I'm a germaphobe, maybe.

12:09.051 --> 12:10.917
Besides, I'm pretty sure
that it is not kosher

12:10.919 --> 12:13.587
to mix saliva and dairy,
so he pretty much fired himself.

12:13.589 --> 12:15.388
- Oh. - Oh. Looks like
he's rehired himself.

12:15.390 --> 12:19.292
Goat cheese tarts? They come
highly recommended by me.

12:19.294 --> 12:20.527
Wha... If you take that,
you're validating him.

12:20.529 --> 12:22.295
What are you still doing here?

12:22.297 --> 12:24.097
I'm waitering pro bono now.

12:24.099 --> 12:25.865
I have a really
great work ethic.

12:25.867 --> 12:27.133
He's challenging her.
I like this.

12:27.135 --> 12:28.501
- Tell me your name.
- Owen.

12:28.503 --> 12:29.769
- I'm on Team Owen.
- Me, too.

12:29.771 --> 12:31.705
What about Team Me? Why
isn't anyone on Team Me?

12:31.707 --> 12:33.673
Why do I always get
picked last for that team?

12:33.675 --> 12:34.908
She fired me 'cause
she's embarrassed

12:34.910 --> 12:36.443
she was checking out
waiter butt.

12:36.445 --> 12:38.011
- She's such an asses-classist.
- That's what we were saying.

12:38.013 --> 12:39.045
You're done.

12:39.047 --> 12:40.213
I am outsourcing your job...

12:40.215 --> 12:42.415
to Team Me.

12:43.818 --> 12:44.984
You saw that, right?

12:44.986 --> 12:46.086
- She did it again.
- Absolutely.

12:46.088 --> 12:47.487
- Totally did it again.
- She did it again.

12:47.489 --> 12:50.423
That's some jersey.

12:50.425 --> 12:51.658
Beth's idea.

12:51.660 --> 12:54.661
Ah. I love her, but we
fight like sisters.

12:54.663 --> 12:56.896
It's like Freud said, "If it's not
one thing, it's your mother."

12:56.898 --> 12:59.098
- I don't know who that is.
- Good.

12:59.100 --> 13:00.366
Tonight's just one night.

13:00.368 --> 13:01.734
But you're gonna
have a great life.

13:01.736 --> 13:04.237
I see you restoring
a townhouse in Highland Park,

13:04.239 --> 13:05.438
summering on Fire Island,

13:05.440 --> 13:07.040
eventually adopting
Vietnamese twins

13:07.042 --> 13:08.741
and having a family
of your own.

13:08.743 --> 13:11.644
Lose the jersey.
It's not you.

13:13.614 --> 13:16.082
♪ Yeah, come on,
party people... ♪

13:16.084 --> 13:18.751
Oh, yeah.
You feelin' it, Jaden?

13:18.753 --> 13:20.219
I feel something.

13:20.221 --> 13:21.287
Ah!
Hey.

13:21.289 --> 13:22.321
Oh, hey.

13:22.323 --> 13:25.124
Lauren.
I am flying.

13:25.126 --> 13:27.360
Is it weird I got high
with some of the kids?

13:27.362 --> 13:30.463
Very.
Jewish chronic rules.

13:30.465 --> 13:32.531
That singer I told you about,
she's on break, right?

13:32.533 --> 13:35.201
The one who dumped you and
you went all Taylor Swift on?

13:35.203 --> 13:38.204
Mm-hmm.
She's right behind you.

13:40.742 --> 13:42.908
Okay, I did not know
you were gonna be here.

13:42.910 --> 13:44.944
I thought you left the business
when that guy picked you up

13:44.946 --> 13:46.145
at that bar mitzvah.

13:46.147 --> 13:47.880
He's my boss now,

13:47.882 --> 13:49.282
and, uh, I'm just
doing him a favor.

13:49.283 --> 13:51.917
Okay, but are we okay?
Because the last time I saw you

13:51.919 --> 13:54.553
at that Stop & Shop,
you cried into a bushel of kale.

13:54.555 --> 13:55.921
Because of the prices.

13:55.923 --> 13:58.858
Just... promise me
this won't get weird.

13:58.860 --> 14:00.459

I don't know. But I'm
starting to think

15:11.732 --> 15:13.398
coke and hookers
might've been easier.

15:13.400 --> 15:14.566
Now you're dancing?

All I care about
is your happiness.

15:23.076 --> 15:24.709
It's a mitzvah.
Am I right, Lauren?

15:24.711 --> 15:26.111
Can you guys tell I'm high?

15:26.113 --> 15:27.445
Yeah.
Yup.

15:27.447 --> 15:29.414
I know it wasn't the sex,
because that was good.

15:29.416 --> 15:31.583
But was it too good? Did it
make you question yourself?

15:31.585 --> 15:32.951
I'm not doing this.

15:32.953 --> 15:36.054
I will leave you alone if
you just tell me what happened.

15:36.056 --> 15:37.255
Nothing happened.

15:37.257 --> 15:39.958
Zoe, we were so in love.
No,<i> you</i> were.

15:39.960 --> 15:42.527
For me it was just fun.
I never loved you, Zach.

15:43.596 --> 15:45.396
I got to get out of here.

15:45.398 --> 15:46.998
Excuse me, excuse me.

15:53.305 --> 15:54.973
Hey!

16:00.816 --> 16:02.250
There go the Cohens.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.852
I see 'em. And the
Cohens from Northbrook,

16:03.854 --> 16:05.420
and the Cohens from Deerfield.

16:05.422 --> 16:07.789
This is the worst bar mitzvah
ever. Thank you, Simon.

16:07.791 --> 16:09.824
Trust me, Beth,
I can turn this around.

16:09.826 --> 16:11.659
A similar thing happened when we
threw a party for Ben & Jerry's

16:11.661 --> 16:13.261
- in '81, minus the peyote pizza.
- Where is your emcee?

16:13.263 --> 16:15.830
Someone needs to keep these
people from leaving.

16:15.832 --> 16:17.599
Don't worry your
pretty little <i> punim.</i>

16:17.601 --> 16:19.033
I know just what to do.

16:20.131 --> 16:23.971
And in these olden times, it
was a dream of every young boy

16:23.973 --> 16:26.541
to one day study the Torah.
But it was also the dream

16:26.543 --> 16:28.943
of a 45-year-old woman,
so she passed herself off

16:28.945 --> 16:32.313
as a younger woman. Pretended to be
a 14-year-old boy with payos envy.

16:32.315 --> 16:34.048
What the hell
is he talking about?

16:34.050 --> 16:36.117
Let him talk, Aunt Sadie, this
is finally getting interesting.

16:36.119 --> 16:37.785
And she was in love with
Amy Irving... no, no, wait...

16:37.787 --> 16:39.987
We still having that drink later?
My father is reading from

16:39.989 --> 16:43.157
- the book of <i> Yentl</i> right now.
I can't do this. - I'll leave

16:43.159 --> 16:46.027
if you just admit that you
fired me partly because

16:46.029 --> 16:49.130
you're too embarrassed to have
a drink with a mere waiter.

16:49.132 --> 16:51.032
You know what? I would
totally date a waiter.

16:51.034 --> 16:52.500
But I would date a good one.

16:52.502 --> 16:54.068
Not one who hovers
over guests' food

16:54.070 --> 16:57.238
like a-a buzzard circling
the carcass of a polar bear.

16:57.240 --> 16:59.206
Tell me, where
is this dreamy land

16:59.208 --> 17:02.009
that has both buzzards
and polar bears? Narnia?

17:02.011 --> 17:04.944
Oh, shut up. You know what I mean.
I would never date a snob

17:04.946 --> 17:07.982
who wouldn't date a waiter. Oh. Well,
that would make you a double snob,

17:07.983 --> 17:10.017
because you're too snobby to date a snob.
Not a thing.

17:10.019 --> 17:11.285
Totally a thing.
Let me guess.

17:11.287 --> 17:12.819
You see yourself
with some brain surgeon

17:12.821 --> 17:16.656
who likes to sip fine wine and
read the poems of Pablo Neruda.

17:16.659 --> 17:18.025
He sounds great.
Do you have his number?

17:18.027 --> 17:19.093
No, but I have yours,

17:19.095 --> 17:20.528
and I wouldn't date you either.

17:20.530 --> 17:21.829
Huh. Reverse snob.

17:21.830 --> 17:22.963
Regular snob.
Waiter.

17:22.964 --> 17:24.098
Ice queen.
Great ass.

17:24.099 --> 17:25.432
Better ass. You want
to make out with me

17:25.434 --> 17:26.934
right now, don't you?
No. Shut up...

17:26.935 --> 17:28.301
Yes.

17:28.304 --> 17:29.903
And Amy Irving was
in love with her.

17:29.905 --> 17:32.640
But she was in love
with Mandy Patinkin,

17:32.642 --> 17:34.241
who one day left the shul

17:34.243 --> 17:36.076
and went off to fight terrorism
with Claire Danes.

17:36.078 --> 17:37.945
I found Zach.
Am I whispering?

17:37.947 --> 17:40.114
No.
I forgot how to whisper.

17:40.116 --> 17:41.248
Aunt Sadie...

17:41.250 --> 17:43.951
Take it away. Mazel tov, Noah.

17:43.953 --> 17:45.252
This is about a girl?

17:45.254 --> 17:47.287
We're about to lose an
account because of a girl?

17:47.289 --> 17:48.455
Hey, as a woman, I'm offended.

17:48.457 --> 17:49.690
As a stoned woman,
do you remember

17:49.692 --> 17:51.492
that show <i> Charles in Charge?
</i> Not at all.

17:51.494 --> 17:55.362
I can't breathe. It wasn't
just some woman, Simon.

17:55.364 --> 17:56.630
She was the one.

17:56.632 --> 17:58.632
And she broke his heart.
Oh, Zach, I'm sorry.

17:58.634 --> 18:00.634
She said she didn't love me.
I love you.

18:00.636 --> 18:01.568
What is she, unhinged?

18:01.570 --> 18:02.869
Did she escape from an asylum?

18:02.871 --> 18:04.705
Or from the Island
of Dr. Moreau?

18:04.707 --> 18:06.440
Was she half cheetah?
Am I half cheetah?

18:06.442 --> 18:09.409
Will someone get her a coffee?
One coffee, coming up.

18:09.411 --> 18:10.977
Why wouldn't she love me?
Oh, who knows?

18:10.979 --> 18:13.480
Sometimes you never find out why
something didn't work out.

18:13.482 --> 18:14.815
It just didn't.

18:14.817 --> 18:17.751
Hey, Zach, I'm sorry
I pushed you into doing this.

18:19.954 --> 18:22.322
Oh, my God, look at that kid.

18:22.324 --> 18:23.657
He's miserable.

18:23.659 --> 18:25.559
I made this night
about me. I-I...

18:25.561 --> 18:28.728
It should have been about him.

18:28.730 --> 18:32.232
You know what made me
the best bar mitzvah emcee?

18:32.234 --> 18:33.900
I never left the kid unhappy.

18:33.902 --> 18:36.569
You know what?
Let's make the kid the client.

18:36.571 --> 18:38.838
Let's give him
something to remember.

18:38.840 --> 18:42.308
I can fix this.
Follow my lead.

18:42.310 --> 18:45.612
But stay out of my light.

18:45.614 --> 18:47.113

Yeah.
