00:08.580 --> 00:09.667
Previously on Get Shorty...

00:09.762 --> 00:10.881
Occupied!

00:11.096 --> 00:13.095
Me and Miles have been
with Amara for a while.

00:13.096 --> 00:15.822
And we have seen boyfriends come and go.

00:15.950 --> 00:16.950
Mostly go.

00:17.164 --> 00:18.164
You don't know her like I do.

00:18.165 --> 00:21.163
She's a... A sensitive,
supportive woman.

00:21.164 --> 00:24.163
This was a business partner of Amara's.

00:24.164 --> 00:26.163
This was a lover. Lover.

00:26.164 --> 00:28.163
Lover.

00:28.164 --> 00:31.163
You ever want to talk about anything.

00:31.164 --> 00:32.164
Just give us a ring.

00:32.165 --> 00:35.164
Okay, let's go. And action!

00:35.235 --> 00:36.235
Fuck!

00:36.275 --> 00:38.056
Who filed an accident report?

00:38.165 --> 00:41.163
Becca Morgan did not scratch her cornea!

00:41.164 --> 00:44.163
"Gravity International stops production
of The Admiral's Mistress."

00:44.164 --> 00:44.997
We talk to Brandon.

00:45.028 --> 00:48.029
We explain to him, again,
that we don't need Becca.

00:48.164 --> 00:50.163
Did Amara just lose her investment?

00:50.164 --> 00:52.164
Excuse me?

00:54.164 --> 00:56.164
We're outta here, come on!

00:57.164 --> 00:59.164
What the fuck just happened?

01:01.000 --> 01:07.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:19.164 --> 01:22.163
It's not that big a deal.

01:22.164 --> 01:23.164
Much as I admire your ability

01:23.165 --> 01:25.163
- to keep things in perspective...
- Thank you.

01:25.164 --> 01:27.544
In what fuckin' world
is this not a big deal?

01:27.600 --> 01:29.599
If we don't make it one.

01:30.164 --> 01:32.163
My cousin got pregnant
on the pill, so...

01:32.164 --> 01:33.518
I mean, it happens.

01:33.799 --> 01:35.415
And I don't need you
to pay for anything,

01:35.481 --> 01:37.018
I just thought you should know.

01:37.165 --> 01:39.163
I'm happy to pay.

01:39.164 --> 01:40.164
Then we'll split it.

01:40.165 --> 01:42.163
Going Dutch on an abortion?

01:42.164 --> 01:44.163
That's civilized.

01:44.164 --> 01:49.164
I'm saying I would pay, but
shouldn't we discuss it first?

01:52.164 --> 01:54.162
I did not expect this.

01:54.235 --> 01:56.234
Is this, like, an Irish Catholic thing?

01:57.164 --> 01:58.898
I don't know, maybe.

01:58.957 --> 02:00.956
No way you and me are having a baby.

02:02.164 --> 02:04.164
Unless we are.

02:05.164 --> 02:08.163
We have fun together.
Don't fuck that up.

02:09.163 --> 02:10.576
I'm on next.

02:10.648 --> 02:12.648
This would be, like, a
different kind of fun.

02:15.164 --> 02:17.163
When I came to the
Silver Dust with Georgina,

02:17.164 --> 02:19.163
and you were trading
punches with some biker...

02:19.164 --> 02:20.164
Ed told me to kick him out.

02:20.165 --> 02:22.078
I thought, "That Irish bouncer is hot."

02:22.195 --> 02:23.195
Yeah?

02:23.267 --> 02:24.907
"When he is done hitting that biker guy,"

02:25.165 --> 02:27.163
"maybe I'll get shitfaced with him."

02:27.164 --> 02:31.163
But I didn't think, "We
should raise a kid together."

02:31.164 --> 02:33.418
You don't think I'm fatherhood material?

02:33.489 --> 02:35.488
Hello.

02:36.164 --> 02:39.163
Hey, what if down the line, we
get our shit together, you and me?

02:39.164 --> 02:41.164
We're gonna wish that we kept the kid.

02:42.164 --> 02:44.163
I'm on.

02:44.164 --> 02:46.163
Katie...

02:47.165 --> 02:49.163
You said you wanted to change.

02:49.164 --> 02:52.163
You wanted to go to college.
Maybe get out of Pahrump.

02:52.164 --> 02:53.164
Yeah, at some point.

02:53.165 --> 02:55.163
Okay. We can do that together.

02:55.164 --> 02:57.163
All right, thank you, Misty.

02:57.164 --> 03:01.163
Now welcome to the stage,
none other than Candy.

03:02.165 --> 03:05.163
Make your appointments now, fellas.

03:28.716 --> 03:30.715
Miles, you're gonna
get me fuckin' fired.

03:30.716 --> 03:31.716
Good, it's a shite job.

03:31.716 --> 03:32.716
Asshole! Get off the stage!

03:32.717 --> 03:34.715
Shut up, you perverts!

03:34.716 --> 03:36.715
Go home and play with your
wife, you'll be fucked.

03:36.716 --> 03:37.716
Fuck...

03:38.716 --> 03:40.716
Marry me.

03:41.716 --> 03:42.716
What are you doing?

03:44.716 --> 03:48.715
Marry me. Before they fucking kill me.

03:57.716 --> 03:59.715
Wouldn't be the worst thing.

03:59.716 --> 04:00.716
Ditching the car in LA.

04:00.717 --> 04:02.715
Relocating to another country.

04:02.716 --> 04:04.716
We're not moving countries, Lulu.

04:05.716 --> 04:07.716
- No.
- And we're gonna fix this.

04:09.065 --> 04:10.065
For sure.

04:12.716 --> 04:17.714
If we did leave, couldn't go to Mexico.

04:17.716 --> 04:21.714
You know, I had a buddy who,
um, did his mission in Botswana.

04:21.716 --> 04:23.715
Didn't sound bad.

04:23.716 --> 04:25.715
Lots of fresh fruit, it's
good fishing country...

04:25.716 --> 04:27.715
I thought that Brandon understood

04:27.716 --> 04:29.715
that Carey Mulligan was
pretty much a done deal.

04:29.716 --> 04:31.715
We didn't need Becca. But I obviously...

04:31.716 --> 04:33.715
Maybe I need to explain a bit.

04:33.716 --> 04:36.715
Maybe Brandon changed his
mind or just hates our movie.

04:36.716 --> 04:39.716
After we spent all that money?
How does that make sense?

04:41.716 --> 04:42.716
I'm gonna call Amara.

04:42.717 --> 04:44.715
- What?
- Put her at ease.

04:44.724 --> 04:45.422
No, no!

04:45.477 --> 04:48.087
There is nothing you can say
that's gonna put her at ease.

04:48.094 --> 04:48.715
No, I have to call her!

04:48.716 --> 04:50.715
- Lulu, it's ringing! Amara?
- Do not! Miles, I swear to God...

04:50.716 --> 04:52.715
Hi.

04:52.716 --> 04:55.716
I'm sorry I didn't call earlier,
but it's been a busy day.

04:57.716 --> 04:58.716
Yes.

04:58.717 --> 05:00.715
I just wanted to
ring and let you know that

05:00.716 --> 05:02.716
the movie's gonna be up
and running in no time.

05:03.716 --> 05:06.715
Not what I hear.

05:06.716 --> 05:07.716
Well, there's probably a little
bit of gossip kicking around,

05:07.717 --> 05:10.715
but pay no attention
to that, we're good.

05:10.716 --> 05:14.715
You know, we've got the sets built,
and the costumes, and, actors.

05:14.716 --> 05:16.715
Studio's not gonna walk away from that.

05:16.716 --> 05:20.716
Also, Carey Mulligan's
gonna play Margaret!

05:22.716 --> 05:24.715
Yeah, so...

05:24.716 --> 05:26.715
It's probably good the movie got
shut down for a couple of days,

05:26.716 --> 05:28.715
to get those details all ironed out.

05:28.716 --> 05:32.716
Much better, really.
So, full steam ahead.

05:34.359 --> 05:36.359
If you have any questions,
just give me a ring?

05:38.716 --> 05:40.715
All right, byebye.

05:40.716 --> 05:42.715
Yeah, that went...

05:42.716 --> 05:45.716
That went better than
I... Yeah, glad I...

07:17.716 --> 07:18.716
No.

07:31.716 --> 07:33.716
Welcome to LA!

07:35.716 --> 07:37.715
Hey, Katie.

07:37.716 --> 07:40.715
- I missed your lips.
- Wow! Sweet place.

07:40.716 --> 07:42.715
Yeah. It's nicer when you
come through the front door.

07:42.716 --> 07:44.715
You're using the back 'cause you think

07:44.716 --> 07:45.716
someone's tailing you,
or watching the place?

07:45.717 --> 07:49.715
No, we're just,
Maybe a bit jumpy,

07:49.716 --> 07:51.715
but there's nothing to worry about.

07:51.716 --> 07:52.716
Where's Emma?

07:52.717 --> 07:54.715
Already asleep. So,
did you talk to Amara?

07:54.716 --> 07:57.715
Yeah, yeah! Explained
the whole situation.

07:57.716 --> 08:00.715
Temporary setback and whatnot.

08:00.716 --> 08:02.715
How nervous are we? Scale of one to 10.

08:02.716 --> 08:05.715
- Um...
- One to 10? I don't know.

08:05.716 --> 08:08.715
Two. Maybe four.

08:08.716 --> 08:10.715
Look at it this way, if
anything happens to me or Lulu,

08:10.716 --> 08:12.715
she's doesn't get her money back.

08:12.716 --> 08:15.715
So, as long as there's any
chance that the film can go ahead,

08:15.716 --> 08:16.716
we're all safe.

08:16.717 --> 08:18.715
Well, sorry, both of you.

08:18.716 --> 08:21.715
I know you worked so hard,
it was gonna be a great movie.

08:21.716 --> 08:24.715
- Hey.
- Will be great, I mean.

08:26.716 --> 08:31.716
It's Alex, next door.
He's taking out the trash.

08:32.716 --> 08:34.716
Like I said. We're
just, a bit jumpy.

08:39.716 --> 08:40.716
I may be at a six.

08:59.208 --> 09:00.208
Pajamas?

09:00.264 --> 09:02.304
These gentlemen did not
give me time to get dressed.

09:03.716 --> 09:04.716
Sit.

09:07.716 --> 09:11.716
Miles say he can get
the movie going again.

09:12.716 --> 09:14.715
Make me back my money.

09:14.716 --> 09:18.715
Your investment was off
the books. Not insured.

09:18.716 --> 09:22.715
Even if Miles were able to set
the film up in a new studio,

09:22.716 --> 09:27.716
which I believe is unlikely, your
investment would not be honored.

09:30.716 --> 09:33.716
You're saying I lost

09:35.716 --> 09:37.716
four million dollars?

09:43.716 --> 09:45.715
How much I got left?

09:45.716 --> 09:47.715
You are financially overextended.

09:47.716 --> 09:51.716
I suggest at some point, you
consider selling or...

09:53.716 --> 09:57.716
Mortgaging one or more of your assets.

09:59.716 --> 10:00.716
You find Rick?

10:00.717 --> 10:02.715
Got someone at his house in LA.

10:02.716 --> 10:04.716
So far, he hasn't been there.

10:10.716 --> 10:11.716
Where else you look?

10:11.717 --> 10:13.715
We'll check his offices.

10:13.716 --> 10:14.716
But I think, he's probably out of town.

10:14.717 --> 10:16.715
If you want...

10:34.716 --> 10:37.716
We go to LA. Tonight.

10:51.716 --> 10:52.716
Dad?

10:53.716 --> 10:55.715
Come in, Shorty.

10:55.716 --> 10:58.715
Unless you only hang
out with celebrities now.

10:58.716 --> 11:00.715
Mom said the movie might go again.

11:00.716 --> 11:01.716
That's the plan.

11:01.717 --> 11:03.715
Can I see the scene I did?

11:03.716 --> 11:05.715
I've got the DVDs of
the dailies in the car.

11:05.716 --> 11:08.715
That's the stuff that we shot,
before we cut it all together.

11:08.716 --> 11:10.715
Yeah, that's exactly what I want.

11:10.716 --> 11:12.715
Then that is exactly what you will get.

11:12.716 --> 11:14.715
I'm going to Kylie's,
but I'll watch tonight.

11:14.716 --> 11:18.715
Okay. Mom was saying that
you're looking at schools.

11:18.716 --> 11:20.715
You had your eye on
some place in Brentwood?

11:20.716 --> 11:25.715
Maybe. I saw pictures online,
so now I'm not that sure.

11:25.716 --> 11:26.716
How come?

11:26.717 --> 11:28.715
Kids look weird.

11:28.716 --> 11:29.716
Weird, like malformed?

11:30.716 --> 11:32.715
Like they have attitude.

11:32.716 --> 11:34.716
All kids look weird. You look weird.

11:36.716 --> 11:37.716
Dad...

11:40.716 --> 11:43.716
I'm not sure yet, if I like LA.

11:46.716 --> 11:48.715
I'm right there with you.

11:48.716 --> 11:50.041
I'll tell you what.
Why don't we just take

11:50.065 --> 11:52.715
our time, see if it grows on us. Deal?

11:52.716 --> 11:54.716
- Deal.
- Okay.

12:04.716 --> 12:07.715
We keep calling the production
office, nobody answers.

12:07.716 --> 12:09.715
We checked the house again.

12:09.716 --> 12:11.715
Search the house on the inside.

12:11.716 --> 12:15.716
Maybe find an address he write
down. Somebody he stay with.

12:16.716 --> 12:18.716
Okay. We can do that.

12:24.716 --> 12:25.716
I was good to Ricky.

12:27.716 --> 12:28.716
And he run off.

12:30.716 --> 12:32.716
Don't even call to check on me.

12:33.716 --> 12:35.716
What kind of man do that?

12:37.716 --> 12:39.715
I'd kill him myself.

12:39.716 --> 12:41.716
Tia. Tia.

12:42.716 --> 12:46.715
I know this thing is
personal, with Rick and...

12:46.716 --> 12:47.716
I know you're angry.

12:47.717 --> 12:52.716
But Miles, he put you
into this movie shit.

12:53.716 --> 12:55.715
That's first priority.

12:55.716 --> 12:56.716
We'll get Rick later.

12:56.717 --> 12:59.715
I find Rick, you find Miles.

12:59.716 --> 13:01.716
Find Miles? We need to take him out.

13:04.716 --> 13:05.716
Sure.

13:11.716 --> 13:15.715
Right. Okay, I'll handle it.

13:15.716 --> 13:18.716
Is it all right if I
take Clipper with me?

13:27.716 --> 13:28.716
You have no idea where he is?

13:28.717 --> 13:31.715
Production office is closed.
And we've been focused on...

13:31.716 --> 13:33.716
Rick. Yeah. Don't worry, I'll find him.

13:42.716 --> 13:44.715
Welcome back to civilization.

13:44.716 --> 13:45.716
Thanks for the gift basket.

13:45.717 --> 13:47.715
That I could live off
for the rest of the year.

13:49.716 --> 13:53.715
Hey, I'm sorry about
The Admiral's Mistress.

13:53.716 --> 13:55.715
That was a tough break.

13:55.716 --> 13:57.715
Yeah, I've been calling
your office about that.

13:57.716 --> 13:58.716
You notice a theme?

14:00.716 --> 14:01.716
Theme?

14:01.716 --> 14:02.716
The gift basket.

14:02.717 --> 14:05.716
Pineapples, bananas, macadamia nuts.

14:07.716 --> 14:09.715
Bounty from the volcanic
shores of Hawaii.

14:09.716 --> 14:12.715
Since that is where we're shooting
Captain Impossible Three,

14:12.716 --> 14:14.716
and you're our new covering exec.

14:16.716 --> 14:19.715
Jason Statham! I love him.

14:19.716 --> 14:22.715
Exciting franchise. And
now it's in good hands.

14:22.716 --> 14:24.016
Thank you.

14:24.230 --> 14:26.715
Any questions going forward,
my door is always open.

14:26.716 --> 14:29.716
And watch out for those macadamia
nuts, they are addictive.

14:32.716 --> 14:33.716
Wait!

14:35.716 --> 14:39.715
About The Admiral's Mistress,
I still don't understand.

14:39.716 --> 14:40.716
We talked about Carey Mulligan.

14:40.717 --> 14:43.715
But we didn't have a
contract with Carey.

14:43.716 --> 14:44.716
And then I got that accident report,

14:44.723 --> 14:47.715
so I sent a doctor to
Becca Morgan's hotel.

14:47.716 --> 14:48.775
You sent a doctor?

14:48.782 --> 14:51.722
And he diagnosed a
possible scratched cornea.

14:52.716 --> 14:53.716
Becca's reps have called us,

14:53.717 --> 14:56.715
they said she's just
as confused as we are.

14:56.716 --> 15:00.715
- That she feels fine.
- Well, she's a trooper, isn't she?

15:00.716 --> 15:02.715
But when you're talking
about the human eye,

15:02.716 --> 15:05.715
you don't take chances.

15:05.716 --> 15:08.716
So, read up on Captain Impossible,
and let's get you to Maui, yeah?

15:09.716 --> 15:11.716
Aloha.

15:19.716 --> 15:20.716
FBI, Los Angeles Bureau.

15:20.717 --> 15:22.715
Yeah, Agent Buchholz, please.

15:22.716 --> 15:23.716
What is this regarding?

15:23.717 --> 15:25.715
It's... It's a case that he's handling.

15:25.716 --> 15:26.716
Can you be specific?

15:26.717 --> 15:28.715
I... He knows what it's about.

15:28.716 --> 15:30.715
Just tell him that Rick
Moreweather's calling.

15:30.716 --> 15:32.715
Sir, I need to know
what this is regarding.

15:32.716 --> 15:34.715
- Yeah? Who's this?
- Sir...

15:34.716 --> 15:38.715
Look, I'm... I got information
about some serious crimes here.

15:38.716 --> 15:40.715
Can you be specific?

15:40.716 --> 15:43.715
Come... I'm in danger, okay?

15:43.716 --> 15:46.715
Agent Buchholz is the
one who told me that so,

15:46.716 --> 15:48.715
if something should happen
to me, and whoever's in charge

15:48.716 --> 15:50.715
finds out that you're the
one who had me on the line,

15:50.716 --> 15:53.715
and then instead of getting Buchholz,
you asked all these questions,

15:53.716 --> 15:56.715
well, I wouldn't want
to be in your position.

15:56.716 --> 15:59.715
Sir, what is your current location?

15:59.716 --> 16:04.715
Yeah, it's, it's 686
Minnelusa Road in Big Bear, okay?

16:04.716 --> 16:06.715
Or I could come to you.

16:06.716 --> 16:07.716
We'll have someone contact you.

16:07.717 --> 16:11.716
Okay, perfect. So when do... Hello?

16:47.716 --> 16:49.715
Yo, no one's here.

16:49.716 --> 16:52.715
So we hang out. I fucking
hate driving in LA.

16:52.716 --> 16:54.715
Miles and Louis both live here?

16:54.716 --> 16:56.715
Yeah. We hang out, wait
for them to walk in.

16:56.716 --> 17:01.715
Yeah, yeah, we'll be like,
"What's good, fellas?"

17:01.716 --> 17:03.716
Search the kitchen, you, the bedroom.

17:06.715 --> 17:09.714
I, I got a text from Gillis.

17:09.715 --> 17:11.714
He says the nightclub is closed,

17:11.715 --> 17:13.714
but it's still for sale.

17:13.715 --> 17:14.715
What I told you.

17:14.717 --> 17:16.715
I said, that shit is on sale!

17:18.715 --> 17:20.714
Hey, you talk to Amara about that?

17:20.715 --> 17:22.714
We don't need Amara.

17:22.715 --> 17:25.714
What we been pulling here in LA?

17:25.715 --> 17:26.715
Couple months, we do
this shit ourselves.

17:26.717 --> 17:30.716
Yeah. Me and him, we
gonna run the place.

17:32.716 --> 17:33.716
Okay.

17:33.717 --> 17:35.715
Models and bottles, yo.

17:35.716 --> 17:36.716
V.I.P., bitch!

17:36.717 --> 17:40.715
Yeah, fire every waitress
that's not a motherfucking 10!

17:40.716 --> 17:43.715
There's no trash. Nothing in the closet.

17:43.716 --> 17:44.716
I can't tell if they've even been here.

17:44.717 --> 17:46.716
Yo, are they staying somewhere else?

17:55.716 --> 17:57.715
I think what it was, we
got our signals crossed.

17:57.716 --> 17:59.715
I mean, we told Brandon
that we had Carey Mulligan.

17:59.716 --> 18:01.715
- Guys...
- But maybe we weren't clear.

18:01.716 --> 18:03.715
I feel like if I just
get in a room with him

18:03.716 --> 18:06.715
I can straighten this whole thing out.

18:06.716 --> 18:09.716
Brandon isn't putting this
film back into production.

18:10.716 --> 18:12.716
Why not?

18:13.716 --> 18:15.715
Who knows? He made a decision.

18:15.716 --> 18:17.715
Did he?

18:17.716 --> 18:18.716
So, he won't be joining
us for this meeting.

18:18.717 --> 18:20.716
Brandon? God, no.

18:22.716 --> 18:26.715
Look, your best option is to
put the project in turnaround,

18:26.716 --> 18:27.716
take it to a different studio.

18:27.716 --> 18:28.716
A different studio?

18:28.717 --> 18:30.715
I called Wes Krupke at MGM.

18:30.716 --> 18:32.715
If you get there by lunch,
he can meet with you today.

18:32.716 --> 18:34.715
What, you called them for us?

18:34.716 --> 18:36.715
Yeah, she's obviously very
keen to help us move on.

18:36.716 --> 18:40.715
So, um, they could pick it
up where we left off, right?

18:40.716 --> 18:43.715
No. It's not really about picking up.

18:43.716 --> 18:45.715
This is about starting over.

18:47.716 --> 18:50.715
Look, I realize this is painful.

18:50.716 --> 18:52.716
Yeah. No, you seem pained.

18:55.716 --> 18:56.716
What about Carey Mulligan?

18:56.716 --> 18:57.716
Yeah, and what about the sets?

18:57.717 --> 18:59.715
I mean, one of 'em burned
down, but the rest...

18:59.716 --> 19:02.715
The crew has been breaking
down sets as we speak.

19:02.716 --> 19:05.716
Carey's already taking another
job, so she's unavailable.

19:08.717 --> 19:12.716
I know. It's a crazy business.

19:15.716 --> 19:16.716
What are you working on?

19:17.716 --> 19:19.715
What?

19:19.716 --> 19:20.716
Have you moved on to
another little project, yet?

19:20.717 --> 19:23.715
I'm an executive. We
cover multiple projects.

19:23.716 --> 19:26.715
We put a lot of work into this, April.

19:26.716 --> 19:29.715
We've had, what? 200 people
working on the movie now for months.

19:29.716 --> 19:31.715
And Brandon wants to scrap
it because some actress got

19:31.716 --> 19:34.715
a little fucking sand in her eye?

19:34.716 --> 19:37.715
You don't want to talk to him and
find out what's really going on?

19:37.716 --> 19:38.716
Fine. Maybe I should.

19:38.716 --> 19:39.716
His office is this way, right?

19:39.716 --> 19:40.716
You do not want to do this.

19:40.717 --> 19:42.715
April, fuck off.

19:42.716 --> 19:43.796
Brandon's gone for the day.

19:45.716 --> 19:46.716
Buddy?

19:46.717 --> 19:50.716
Hey. She says Brandon's not even here.

19:52.716 --> 19:53.716
Yeah, he left early.

19:53.717 --> 19:55.716
I don't know.

20:00.716 --> 20:03.715
Hey, look, I know that
this is making you crazy.

20:03.716 --> 20:05.715
And it's making me crazy.

20:05.716 --> 20:10.715
But April has set up a meeting at M&M...

20:10.716 --> 20:14.716
Sounds like, maybe
that's our best shot.

20:16.716 --> 20:17.716
All right?

21:04.716 --> 21:05.716
God damn it.

21:10.104 --> 21:11.104
It's Rick.

21:12.716 --> 21:13.716
I'm reading.

21:14.716 --> 21:16.715
He's reading.

21:16.716 --> 21:18.716
He says he needs to talk to you.

21:22.716 --> 21:24.715
Got a call from a collection agency.

21:24.716 --> 21:26.715
What?

21:26.716 --> 21:28.715
Blood test you wanted me
to get, that I didn't want?

21:28.716 --> 21:32.715
Twohundred bucks. Went to a collection
agency, now my credit's fucked.

21:32.716 --> 21:35.715
Well, can you pay it?

21:35.716 --> 21:36.716
Who's got $200 for that?

21:36.717 --> 21:40.715
Dad, cash is a little tight right now.

21:40.716 --> 21:41.716
Why?

21:42.811 --> 21:44.810
I had a setback.

21:44.850 --> 21:45.850
What kind of setback?

21:46.717 --> 21:48.715
Just a project that fell
through. I just... Whatever.

21:48.716 --> 21:51.715
I'm just saying we need to tighten
our belts a little right now

21:51.716 --> 21:53.715
until I get something going, okay?

21:53.716 --> 21:54.716
And that could be a while.

21:54.717 --> 21:56.715
Like my belt could get any tighter.

21:56.716 --> 21:57.716
Short of eating cat food.

21:57.717 --> 22:01.715
Okay, listen, um, I called to ask you,

22:01.716 --> 22:03.715
how do you turn the gas on at the cabin?

22:03.716 --> 22:05.716
You're at the cabin?

22:06.716 --> 22:07.716
Yeah. Yeah, I am.

22:07.717 --> 22:09.715
You're broke, but you're on vacation?

22:09.716 --> 22:10.716
Are you gonna help me or not?

22:10.717 --> 22:14.206
I don't know about gas.
Caretaker does that.

22:14.279 --> 22:15.674
You have a caretaker?

22:15.717 --> 22:17.716
Not since we owe him money.

22:21.065 --> 22:23.064
Here you are.

22:23.716 --> 22:25.715
Thanks for seeing us on short notice.

22:25.716 --> 22:26.716
Sure. Thank you.

22:26.717 --> 22:29.715
You know, April raved about
you guys, I'm a huge April fan.

22:29.716 --> 22:30.716
Hold on one second.
You guys mind if I eat?

22:30.717 --> 22:32.715
'Cause I'm going right back to set.

22:32.716 --> 22:33.716
- You go ahead.
- You want anything?

22:33.717 --> 22:35.715
- No, we're good.
- No.

22:35.716 --> 22:36.716
Thanks.

22:36.717 --> 22:41.715
All right. So I read the script,

22:41.716 --> 22:43.715
I don't know, some months ago, you know?

22:43.716 --> 22:47.715
I just like to know what's
out there. And of the...

22:47.716 --> 22:50.715
two hundred or so scripts
I got through last year,

22:50.716 --> 22:52.716
Admiral's Mistress has gotta be...

22:55.716 --> 22:56.716
top three?

22:57.716 --> 22:58.716
Wow, man. Thank you.

22:58.717 --> 23:00.715
Yeah, I mean that is, it's epic.

23:00.716 --> 23:02.716
It's the kind of film
we make at this studio.

23:04.950 --> 23:07.715
Well, just let us know
when it's finished then.

23:16.716 --> 23:18.715
Can I ask you guys, um,

23:18.716 --> 23:21.715
are there any attachments
I need to know about?

23:21.716 --> 23:24.715
You know, actors, producers, other
than yourselves and Rick Moreweather

23:24.716 --> 23:26.715
that we'd have to keep on board.

23:26.716 --> 23:31.715
Right. Yeah, there is, um,
her name is Amara De Escalones,

23:31.716 --> 23:34.715
she was an early investor. She'd
probably need to get paid back.

23:34.716 --> 23:35.716
Her money back from the last production?

23:35.717 --> 23:37.715
Right.

23:37.716 --> 23:41.715
Um, yeah, well, we don't really do that.

23:41.716 --> 23:45.715
Um, but hold on, we're getting ahead
of ourselves, so let's... Let's not.

23:45.716 --> 23:47.715
Let's talk about the
story, which, as I said,

23:47.716 --> 23:49.715
is marvelous, aside from the ending.

23:49.716 --> 23:51.715
You don't like the end?

23:51.716 --> 23:55.715
I don't. Um, I mean, it
just sort of ends, you know?

23:55.716 --> 23:57.715
I mean, she walks out to
the cliff, maybe she jumps,

23:57.716 --> 23:59.715
maybe not. It's, you know, copout.

23:59.716 --> 24:01.715
- Really?
- Hey, look,

24:01.716 --> 24:04.715
I do not want you to
sell out your ending.

24:04.716 --> 24:06.715
But, I mean, what I'm thinking,

24:06.716 --> 24:09.715
maybe there's an uplifting place

24:09.716 --> 24:12.716
to leave this story that's also complex.

24:16.716 --> 24:18.716
What would that be?

24:21.716 --> 24:22.756
Well, that's the question.

24:34.716 --> 24:35.716
Hi, there.

24:35.717 --> 24:37.715
Hi.

24:37.716 --> 24:40.715
Can I see the insurance claim paperwork
for The Admiral's Mistress?

24:40.716 --> 24:41.716
I'm the covering exec.

24:41.717 --> 24:43.715
- Sure, yeah...
- I can help with that.

24:43.716 --> 24:44.716
Great. Thanks.

24:44.717 --> 24:46.715
Can I ask what this is for?

24:46.716 --> 24:48.715
Just being thorough.

24:48.716 --> 24:51.715
Right. So I will put in the
request with Brandon's office

24:51.716 --> 24:53.715
and the minute they sign
off, I will give you a call.

24:53.716 --> 24:55.716
I can't see the paperwork
for my own project?

24:57.716 --> 24:59.715
Aren't you on Captain Impossible?

24:59.716 --> 25:00.716
Congratulations, by the way.

25:00.717 --> 25:03.715
Jason Statham is awesome.

25:15.716 --> 25:16.716
April Quinn's office.

25:16.717 --> 25:18.715
Hi, Miles Daly please?

25:18.716 --> 25:20.715
- Can I ask who's calling?
- It's his wife.

25:20.716 --> 25:22.715
He left his cell phone
at the house earlier.

25:22.716 --> 25:24.715
Probably thinks he lost it.

25:24.716 --> 25:27.715
No. He just left.

25:27.716 --> 25:29.715
Um, do you know where he's headed?

25:29.716 --> 25:32.715
I was supposed to meet
him for lunch later.

25:32.716 --> 25:34.716
He has a meeting at MGM.

25:35.716 --> 25:37.715
Yes. That's right.

25:37.716 --> 25:40.715
You wouldn't happen to
have the address, would you?

25:42.716 --> 25:45.715
- Yo.
- He's at MGM Studios.

25:45.716 --> 25:46.716
Address is in Beverly Hills.

25:46.717 --> 25:48.715
Text it to me, okay?

25:48.716 --> 25:49.716
Just did.

25:49.717 --> 25:51.715
Fucking love you.

25:51.716 --> 25:53.715
What'd she say? She got it?

25:53.716 --> 25:54.716
They're going to MGM.

25:54.717 --> 25:56.715
Nice, son!

25:56.716 --> 25:57.716
So, we heading out?

25:57.717 --> 26:00.715
I can't go. Tia
wants me to go to the hotel.

26:00.716 --> 26:01.716
She's fucking freaking out about Rick.

26:01.717 --> 26:03.715
But you gotta be there
when we take Miles out.

26:03.716 --> 26:05.715
He's in an office full of people.

26:05.716 --> 26:07.715
You're not gonna shoot the place up.

26:07.716 --> 26:10.715
Sammy, you stay here
in case they come back.

26:10.716 --> 26:13.716
You two, go to this address.

26:17.716 --> 26:19.715
All right? I'm gonna send it to you.

26:19.716 --> 26:21.715
Don't let them spot you.

26:21.716 --> 26:23.715
When they leave, see where they go.

26:23.716 --> 26:25.715
Then take 'em out.

26:25.716 --> 26:27.715
No. Call me and then I come over.

26:27.716 --> 26:29.715
Yeah, right.

26:29.716 --> 26:30.716
Don't let them fucking see you.

26:30.717 --> 26:32.715
We can do that.

26:32.716 --> 26:35.716
Okay. Fucking go!

26:40.716 --> 26:43.716
Hello? Anybody?

26:44.716 --> 26:46.715
Friendly neighbor here.

26:46.716 --> 26:48.716
Hey there, sir. How are you?

26:50.716 --> 26:51.716
Hey, I don't know if you know I'm...

26:51.717 --> 26:54.715
Okay! Okay, okay! Shit!

26:54.716 --> 26:57.715
God damn it, Cooper, come
on! Get back in the house.

26:57.716 --> 26:58.716
Get him in the house.

26:59.716 --> 27:00.716
Sorry. Startled me,

27:00.717 --> 27:02.716
startled me just a little bit there.

27:03.716 --> 27:04.716
He's pretty though.

27:04.717 --> 27:08.715
Anyway, I don't know,
if you know Giustino,

27:08.716 --> 27:10.716
I'm his son, Rick. What's your name?

27:13.716 --> 27:14.716
Jim.

27:14.717 --> 27:17.715
It's nice to meet you, Jim.

27:17.716 --> 27:19.715
I actually may have, met
you a couple times before,

27:19.716 --> 27:22.715
I don't know, I haven't
been back here in years.

27:24.716 --> 27:27.715
Anyway, I'm having a little bit
of trouble turning that gas on.

27:27.716 --> 27:31.715
I don't know, I see the thing, the pipe,

27:31.716 --> 27:32.716
and I don't know what to do, you know?

27:32.717 --> 27:34.715
I don't want to blow the
place up, I thought maybe...

27:34.716 --> 27:36.715
You got no right driving on that road.

27:36.716 --> 27:38.715
What?

27:38.716 --> 27:41.715
Told your father when he came
up here with that black maid,

27:41.716 --> 27:42.716
or girlfriend, whatever she is.

27:42.717 --> 27:44.716
I said, you cannot
drive across my property.

27:45.716 --> 27:47.715
Didn't realize.

27:47.716 --> 27:50.715
Come down here doing
25, 30 mile an hour,

27:50.716 --> 27:51.716
throwing gravel all in the weeds.

27:51.716 --> 27:52.716
Who do you think pays for that gravel?

27:52.716 --> 27:53.716
We do.

27:53.717 --> 27:55.715
We do.

27:55.716 --> 28:00.715
I just, thought that was
the only road that came in here.

28:00.716 --> 28:02.715
Far side of your cabin there's this path

28:02.716 --> 28:04.716
that takes you all
the way down to the 38.

28:06.716 --> 28:10.716
All right. Well, that's
what I'm gonna use.

28:11.716 --> 28:12.716
You do that.

28:13.716 --> 28:15.716
All right. Take care.

28:17.716 --> 28:19.716
Be over later.

28:20.191 --> 28:21.191
What?

28:21.263 --> 28:22.263
Help you turn on the gas.

28:31.716 --> 28:34.716
Hey, Tia, what's this?

28:35.716 --> 28:37.715
Stuff we got at Rick's house.

28:37.716 --> 28:41.715
Laptop, Rolodex. See if we
can find where he's staying.

28:41.716 --> 28:43.716
He's working on the laptop password.

28:46.716 --> 28:47.716
Wait outside.

28:50.716 --> 28:53.716
Yo, wait outside.

28:57.716 --> 28:58.716
Closing in on him?

29:00.716 --> 29:01.716
You mean Rick?

29:01.717 --> 29:03.715
Miles, too.

29:03.716 --> 29:05.715
He's at a meeting at MGM right now.

29:05.716 --> 29:07.715
I have a couple guys tailing him.

29:07.716 --> 29:08.716
Sammy's at the house, just in case...

29:08.717 --> 29:10.716
Didn't call you about Miles.

29:13.716 --> 29:14.716
Okay.

29:17.716 --> 29:21.715
Mexico is angry with
me, 'cause of Josias.

29:21.716 --> 29:26.715
Now I'm in LA, they're afraid
I'm gonna do business here.

29:26.716 --> 29:30.715
I say, "Don't worry.
I just make a movie."

29:30.716 --> 29:33.716
They can't complain about that.

29:36.716 --> 29:38.716
But if you're selling cocaina?

29:39.716 --> 29:41.716
Somebody say I'm selling in LA?

29:44.716 --> 29:45.716
I'm not stupid.

29:47.716 --> 29:50.716
Seriously, someone said that shit?

29:51.716 --> 29:53.715
What are you doing?

29:53.716 --> 29:54.716
Tia, what do you mean, what I'm doing?

29:54.717 --> 29:58.715
The only reason you're alive

29:58.716 --> 30:01.715
is 'cause of me. You keep selling...

30:01.716 --> 30:03.715
Whoever said something
got bad information.

30:03.716 --> 30:06.716
It's like, fake news.

30:07.716 --> 30:09.715
I'm not dealing in LA, all right?

30:09.716 --> 30:12.716
And whoever said something
better watch their fucking mouth.

30:28.716 --> 30:30.715
Hey, yo, deal with this while I call.

30:30.716 --> 30:32.715
No, we pay on the way out.

30:32.716 --> 30:35.715
No, it says we don't pay on the way out,

30:35.716 --> 30:37.715
we use the machine.

30:37.716 --> 30:39.716
What, you ain't got a credit card?

30:41.716 --> 30:44.716
Damn, bro. I see you.

30:49.716 --> 30:50.716
Give me good news.

30:50.717 --> 30:52.715
Yo, sorry, bro.

30:52.716 --> 30:53.716
They already finished the
meeting. They took off.

30:53.717 --> 30:55.715
How do you know?

30:55.716 --> 30:57.715
It's what the lady
said at the front desk.

30:57.716 --> 31:01.715
Lady at the studio? So
she can fucking ID you?

31:01.716 --> 31:02.716
Man, what else were we supposed to do?

31:02.717 --> 31:05.715
Wait outside all night,
not even know if they left?

31:19.716 --> 31:20.716
Hey, Clip.

31:22.716 --> 31:24.715
Hey.

31:24.716 --> 31:26.716
I didn't know you were in LA.

31:28.716 --> 31:31.716
Shit.

32:03.716 --> 32:05.716
Shit!

32:08.716 --> 32:09.716
Lou, come on, get up.

32:22.716 --> 32:24.716
Lou.

32:39.716 --> 32:41.715
Fuck! Shit!

32:41.716 --> 32:43.715
What can I help you with?

32:43.716 --> 32:45.715
We need directions to
the nearest hospital.

32:45.716 --> 32:48.715
Getting directions to
the nearest hospital.

32:48.716 --> 32:53.715
Lou, you need to apply pressure to
slow the bleeding, okay? Lou? Louis!

32:53.716 --> 32:54.716
- In half a mile, turn left on 3rd Street.
- Yeah.

32:54.717 --> 32:57.715
Fuck me, you didn't
want any part of this.

32:57.716 --> 33:01.715
You said that this was all gonna
turn to shit and I didn't listen.

33:01.716 --> 33:05.715
I'm sorry. I'm fucking sorry, man!

33:05.716 --> 33:09.716
Working on this movie
is the best thing I ever did.

33:11.716 --> 33:13.715
They used one of my lines.

33:13.716 --> 33:16.715
They did. A line that you wrote.

33:16.716 --> 33:18.715
Get out of the fucking way!

33:18.716 --> 33:22.715
In a quarter
mile, turn left on 3rd Street.

33:22.716 --> 33:24.715
Yeah, he didn't like the ending.

33:24.716 --> 33:25.716
What's that?

33:25.717 --> 33:30.716
The guy at MGM. He said
the ending is a downer.

33:31.716 --> 33:33.715
It is a downer.

33:33.716 --> 33:35.715
Don't worry about that now, man.

33:35.716 --> 33:38.715
We'll find a different ending, okay?

33:38.716 --> 33:41.715
In 500 feet, turn left on 3rd Street.

33:44.716 --> 33:45.716
Fuck off!

33:46.716 --> 33:49.715
Hi. It's April.

33:49.716 --> 33:51.715
Hope the meeting went well.

33:51.716 --> 33:54.715
There's something we should discuss,

33:54.716 --> 33:58.716
but I can't talk about
it at the office. Call me.

34:02.716 --> 34:04.716
You have arrived at your destination.

34:14.716 --> 34:16.715
Fuck.

34:16.716 --> 34:18.715
Hey, there's a man in this car,

34:18.716 --> 34:19.716
he's been shot, he's bleeding out.

34:19.717 --> 34:21.716
Get us some help, please! Now!

34:24.716 --> 34:25.716
Okay, Lulu. They're coming,

34:25.716 --> 34:26.716
they're gonna fix you right up, okay?

34:26.717 --> 34:29.715
What if, at the end...

34:29.716 --> 34:31.715
What's that?

34:31.716 --> 34:33.715
End of the movie.

34:33.716 --> 34:36.715
Margaret goes and finds Felton,

34:36.716 --> 34:39.716
at the hospital, she saves him.

34:41.716 --> 34:42.956
- That's a happy ending.
- Yeah.

34:44.716 --> 34:46.715
Yeah, I like that.

34:46.716 --> 34:48.715
We'll go with that ending, okay?

34:48.716 --> 34:51.715
Sir? I got it. Okay.

34:56.716 --> 34:57.716
- Easy.
- Here we go.

35:00.716 --> 35:01.716
Let's move.

35:17.716 --> 35:19.715
Katie, you better take it.

35:19.716 --> 35:21.715
You can bring her in.

35:21.716 --> 35:24.715
Well, if someone's gonna drop
her, I'd prefer if it was you.

35:26.716 --> 35:27.716
Welcome home, Shorty.

35:30.716 --> 35:32.716
Yeah.

35:48.717 --> 35:50.715
- I gotta take this.
- Okay.

35:50.716 --> 35:52.715
Hey, how's it going?

35:52.716 --> 35:55.715
- Been better.
- Meeting went bad?

35:55.716 --> 35:58.716
Not so much that, as
getting shot on the way out.

36:00.716 --> 36:01.716
What?

36:01.717 --> 36:07.715
Yeah. I, I need help.

36:07.716 --> 36:10.715
Okay, tell me exactly what happened.

36:10.716 --> 36:13.715
A bullet on the left side.

36:13.716 --> 36:17.715
Not too deep. I think it went in
and came out. It's hard to tell.

36:17.716 --> 36:19.716
- Dad?
- Shit.

36:20.716 --> 36:23.716
I heard you come
in. Thought it was Mom.

36:24.716 --> 36:27.715
Hey, love! I'm just taking a bath.

36:27.716 --> 36:30.715
- A bath?
- Very relaxing.

36:30.716 --> 36:32.715
- Miles?
- Hold on.

36:32.716 --> 36:37.715
Did you see the dailies I left
by the telly? Stack of DVDs.

36:37.716 --> 36:39.715
- Awesome. Thanks.
- Miles.

36:39.716 --> 36:40.716
Hey.

36:40.717 --> 36:42.715
Emma's home? She's
supposed to be at Kylie's.

36:42.716 --> 36:43.716
She didn't see anything.

36:43.717 --> 36:46.715
Okay, I'll be there as soon as I can.

36:51.716 --> 36:52.716
- That's it.
- That's it?

36:52.717 --> 36:55.715
That little freakin' knob? My God.

36:55.716 --> 37:00.715
I ate a cold can of ravioli, that's
how desperate I was last night.

37:00.716 --> 37:01.716
Ravioli's pretty good.
Even when it's cold.

37:01.717 --> 37:03.716
What is this?

37:05.716 --> 37:07.715
Your friends got no right
to be driving on this road.

37:07.716 --> 37:10.715
Yeah, yeah, they're not
my friends, they're cops.

37:10.716 --> 37:11.716
What?

37:11.717 --> 37:14.716
Yeah. Don't worry, they're not
gonna arrest anybody, they're just...

37:18.716 --> 37:21.715
Hey, guys. Boy. I'm glad to see you.

37:21.716 --> 37:23.715
Okay? So, what do you...
What do you wanna do?

37:23.716 --> 37:25.716
You want to come inside,
or should I go with you?

37:26.716 --> 37:28.715
We'll come inside.

37:32.716 --> 37:34.715
What do you mean, I'm not a witness?

37:34.716 --> 37:36.715
I... I witnessed, for one
thing, a guy who got shot.

37:36.716 --> 37:39.715
But you don't know who shot him.

37:39.716 --> 37:42.715
Okay, well, Amara had my
producing partner beat up.

37:42.716 --> 37:44.715
All right? If you'd
have seen his face...

37:44.716 --> 37:46.716
You have nothing we can
use against her in court.

37:48.716 --> 37:50.715
Well, if I have
nothing you could use,

37:50.716 --> 37:51.716
why'd you drive up here?

37:53.716 --> 37:57.715
We believe, and our boss believes,

37:57.716 --> 37:59.716
you could be useful down the road.

38:02.716 --> 38:04.715
What are we talking about?

38:04.716 --> 38:05.716
A wire...

38:05.717 --> 38:08.715
No. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

38:08.716 --> 38:10.715
The technology these
days is really cool.

38:10.716 --> 38:12.715
You can record with a credit card...

38:12.716 --> 38:14.715
The SIM card in your phone.

38:14.716 --> 38:17.715
Guys, I lost four million
dollars of her money.

38:17.716 --> 38:21.715
Those pictures you showed me of her
exboyfriends with their heads cut off?

38:21.716 --> 38:22.716
They probably forgot her birthday.

38:22.717 --> 38:25.715
Look, we appreciate how
much danger you're in.

38:25.716 --> 38:27.715
It's impressive that
you've lasted this long.

38:27.716 --> 38:30.715
But ensuring your
safety will be expensive.

38:30.716 --> 38:34.716
Our boss won't sign off
unless you make a contribution.

38:39.232 --> 38:40.716
Jesus.

38:40.717 --> 38:42.716
So, will you help us out?

38:44.716 --> 38:47.716
Take a minute. Think it through.

38:51.716 --> 38:54.715
If I could pull the whole thing off,

38:54.716 --> 38:57.715
but, I'm a terrible liar.
People see right through me.

38:57.716 --> 38:58.716
Good luck.

38:58.717 --> 39:00.715
Come on. Come on, there's
gotta be some other way

39:00.716 --> 39:02.715
that I can help here. Really?

39:02.716 --> 39:04.715
You're gonna leave me here.

39:04.716 --> 39:06.716
If I were you, I'd keep a low profile.

39:07.716 --> 39:09.715
Lower than this?

39:09.716 --> 39:13.715
Hey, thanks. Okay,
guys. Thanks! Thanks a lot.

39:13.716 --> 39:17.716
Yeah, thank you. Thanks for everything.

39:47.716 --> 39:49.715
He was listed in critical condition

39:49.716 --> 39:51.715
- when he was admitted.
- But is he alive?

39:51.716 --> 39:53.715
He was listed as critical,
that's all I can tell you.

39:53.716 --> 39:55.715
Miles.

39:55.716 --> 39:56.716
Thank you. Yeah.

39:58.716 --> 40:00.715
Fuck.

40:00.716 --> 40:02.715
I know what you're thinking.

40:02.716 --> 40:05.715
You gave me this shirt, and now
I've only gone and fucking ruined it.

40:05.716 --> 40:08.715
You need to lift it up... Easy.

40:15.716 --> 40:16.716
Emma?

40:16.717 --> 40:19.715
All right. Downstairs, totally
engrossed in your movie.

40:19.716 --> 40:21.715
Here, take these. Valium.

40:25.716 --> 40:27.715
I'll numb you up, abrade the wound...

40:27.716 --> 40:28.716
then close it with dermaglue.

40:28.716 --> 40:29.716
The fuck is dermaglue?

40:29.717 --> 40:31.715
Superglue for the skin.

40:31.716 --> 40:34.715
Fuck it!

40:34.716 --> 40:35.716
Valium will help.

40:35.717 --> 40:38.715
No, it's not that.

40:38.716 --> 40:41.716
Lulu's in the hospital.
He got shotup real bad.

40:44.716 --> 40:45.716
What hospital?

40:45.717 --> 40:47.716
Mount Olympus.

40:50.716 --> 40:53.715
Okay, I'll call when we're
done, talk to a doctor.

40:53.716 --> 40:54.716
Thank you.

40:55.716 --> 40:56.716
Fuck.

40:56.717 --> 40:59.716
So, you know, a real doctor
would keep you in bed for a week.

41:00.716 --> 41:03.716
What is that stuff? That
is fucking brilliant!

41:07.716 --> 41:08.716
Who did this?

41:10.716 --> 41:11.716
Yago's buddies.

41:11.717 --> 41:13.716
Is it over, or are
they coming after you?

41:15.152 --> 41:16.152
Not over.

41:17.716 --> 41:19.715
I'll get you bandaged and we'll leave.

41:19.716 --> 41:21.715
We'll get a hotel up
north, we'll pay in cash.

41:21.716 --> 41:23.715
I'm not coming with you.

41:23.716 --> 41:26.715
If they come looking for me,
I don't want you guys around.

41:26.716 --> 41:28.715
You should both go
up the coast somewhere

41:28.716 --> 41:30.716
and I'll call you when
I know things are safe.

41:32.716 --> 41:36.715
I thought things would be
different here in shiny LA. I did.

41:36.716 --> 41:38.715
It's just a nicer bathroom
for you to bleed in.

41:38.716 --> 41:42.715
- Katie.
- We'll talk later, I need to focus.

41:42.716 --> 41:45.715
What the fuck is that?

41:45.716 --> 41:47.716
Hold on to something. Don't watch.

41:49.717 --> 41:51.715
And action!

41:51.716 --> 41:54.715
Might I ask you
to deliver a letter before I leave?

41:54.716 --> 41:56.715
They said you'd gone.

41:56.716 --> 41:58.716
- Hey, I had a thought.
- Kitty.

41:59.716 --> 42:00.716
Hello?

42:01.716 --> 42:02.716
Mom!

42:03.716 --> 42:05.715
I just got a call from work.

42:05.716 --> 42:06.716
They screwed up my schedule
and now they're saying

42:06.717 --> 42:09.715
I don't have to work till next week.

42:09.716 --> 42:10.716
Why?

42:10.717 --> 42:12.715
I don't know, but
since Miles is working,

42:12.716 --> 42:15.715
I thought you and me could take a trip.

42:15.716 --> 42:18.715
Drive to Santa Barbara, we
could, stay at a hotel.

42:18.716 --> 42:19.716
We could go whale watching.

42:19.717 --> 42:21.715
Whale watching?

42:21.716 --> 42:24.715
- Yeah.
- When?

42:24.716 --> 42:25.716
Tonight.

42:25.717 --> 42:27.715
Tonight? No.

42:27.716 --> 42:29.715
I made plans with Kylie for tomorrow.

42:29.716 --> 42:31.715
And we just got back from Nevada.

42:31.716 --> 42:33.715
We won't have a chance to
do this for a while. Please.

42:33.716 --> 42:36.715
Let's make the most of it?

42:36.716 --> 42:38.036
Did you and Dad get into a fight?

42:39.716 --> 42:41.715
- No.
- Then what's going on?

42:41.716 --> 42:45.715
Nothing. Just... I'm
going upstairs to pack.

42:45.716 --> 42:46.716
I get no say in this?

42:46.717 --> 42:48.715
You'll love it when we get there.

42:48.716 --> 42:50.574
Come on, throw some
clothes and a bathing

42:50.653 --> 42:52.722
suit in a bag. Let's get on the road.

42:53.716 --> 42:55.716
Can't believe the fucking...

42:58.716 --> 43:00.716
I can't believe this. Shit.

43:12.716 --> 43:14.716
I fucking hate...

43:27.716 --> 43:30.715
I'm expecting to see photos of whales.

43:30.716 --> 43:32.716
- I love you.
- Love you.

43:51.716 --> 43:53.715
- Giustino?
- What?

43:53.716 --> 43:54.996
Some people are here to see you.

44:01.716 --> 44:03.716
Friends of Rick's.

44:05.716 --> 44:09.716
- Okay.
- Amara. Nice to meet you. This is Ed.

44:10.716 --> 44:11.716
Giustino.

44:11.717 --> 44:14.715
I'm old friend of
Rick's. But we lost touch.

44:14.716 --> 44:16.715
So I look for him.

44:16.716 --> 44:17.716
Try his cell phone.

44:17.717 --> 44:19.715
He got new number.

44:19.716 --> 44:22.716
What? He's had the same number
since they invented the cell phone.

44:25.716 --> 44:27.715
Rick make this movie?

44:27.716 --> 44:29.715
That? No.

44:29.716 --> 44:33.716
Rick makes different kinda
movies. That one's mine.

44:35.716 --> 44:36.716
You make movies?

44:36.717 --> 44:38.715
Yeah, back in the Jurassic period.

44:38.716 --> 44:39.716
Jurassic?

44:39.717 --> 44:41.716
Dinosaurs.

44:45.716 --> 44:47.715
You help me find Rick?

44:47.716 --> 44:49.715
I want to surprise him.

44:49.716 --> 44:51.715
Leave your name. I'll tell
him you dropped by, okay?

44:51.716 --> 44:53.715
I gotta get back.

44:53.716 --> 44:54.716
I invest.

44:56.716 --> 44:58.715
You what?

44:58.716 --> 45:01.715
Rick sent us two movie
scripts for Amara to consider,

45:01.716 --> 45:04.715
Swamp Children, and
Sniper at the Gates of Dawn.

45:04.716 --> 45:06.715
Sounds about right.

45:06.716 --> 45:09.716
Amara's interested in producing
these films. If she can find him.

45:14.716 --> 45:16.715
He's at a cabin in Big Bear.

45:16.716 --> 45:18.715
There's no landline,
there's bad reception.

45:18.716 --> 45:21.716
So, if he doesn't answer,
don't take it personally.

45:22.716 --> 45:24.716
Where in Big Bear?

45:28.716 --> 45:30.716
How the fuck did she
find out we were slinging?

45:32.716 --> 45:33.716
Shit.

45:34.716 --> 45:35.716
You don't think it was Clipper who...

45:35.717 --> 45:38.715
Told Amara? Nah.

45:40.716 --> 45:41.716
Shit...

45:41.717 --> 45:44.715
But can we see that flake out of here?

45:44.716 --> 45:47.715
If Mexico knows, I mean...

45:47.716 --> 45:51.715
I saw a picture of what
they did to some dealer.

45:51.716 --> 45:54.715
Got a thousand kitchen knives
and they stuck it in this dude,

45:54.716 --> 45:57.715
all over his body like
a fucking porcupine.

45:57.716 --> 46:00.716
Man.

46:02.716 --> 46:03.716
I should go to a hospital.

46:03.717 --> 46:05.715
No, no, no, no. Rupert's on his way.

46:05.716 --> 46:09.715
No, man. No. That dude,
he is not a doctor.

46:09.716 --> 46:13.715
He gave me antibiotics
once. That shit was expired.

46:13.716 --> 46:16.716
You go to the hospital,
cops start asking questions.

46:17.716 --> 46:20.716
They're looking for a
shooter, right? Right?

46:30.716 --> 46:32.715
Amara knows Miles took off?

46:32.716 --> 46:34.715
Nah, I didn't tell her.

46:34.716 --> 46:36.716
Conversation was bad enough.

46:37.716 --> 46:39.715
But we'll find him.

46:39.716 --> 46:41.716
We'll find him and
we'll fucking end this.

46:43.716 --> 46:46.715
Get out of LA.

46:46.716 --> 46:48.716
Amara comes back to Nevada.

46:50.716 --> 46:52.715
Yeah. You know what?

46:52.716 --> 46:55.716
It's gonna work out, right?

46:58.716 --> 46:59.716
Shit!

47:43.717 --> 47:45.716
- Who is it?
- Miles.

47:49.716 --> 47:50.716
I got your message.

47:50.717 --> 47:52.715
I meant, meet me at a coffee shop.

47:52.716 --> 47:53.716
Not come to my place. What time is it?

47:53.717 --> 47:55.716
We have a lot to talk about, April.

47:56.716 --> 47:58.716
You have any drink in here?

47:59.716 --> 48:03.716
So, overall, the guy at
the studio. The, um...

48:05.716 --> 48:06.716
What was his fucking name?

48:06.717 --> 48:08.715
- Wes.
- Wes!

48:08.716 --> 48:11.715
Wes is very interested.
Very, very interest...

48:11.716 --> 48:14.715
He has some issues with the
ending, but we can work on that.

48:14.716 --> 48:17.716
If it means that we can
get things going, you know?

48:18.716 --> 48:21.715
Okay. The reason I called you?

48:23.716 --> 48:26.196
So, Gravity filed an insurance claim
on The Admiral's Mistress.

48:28.716 --> 48:31.715
Back when I was an assistant, I heard...

48:31.716 --> 48:33.715
I mean, I never actually saw proof,

48:33.716 --> 48:36.715
- but I think that it happens...
- What's that?

48:36.716 --> 48:40.716
Studios pad insurance claims with
expenses from other productions.

48:44.716 --> 48:45.875
Okay.

48:45.914 --> 48:47.710
I can't actually prove that
it happened in our case.

48:47.717 --> 48:50.715
So, you think Brandon pulled the plug

48:50.716 --> 48:53.715
because he was trying to bail
out another fucking movie?

48:53.716 --> 48:54.716
Well, it wouldn't be a lot of money.

48:54.717 --> 48:56.715
Our budget wasn't big and...

48:56.716 --> 49:00.715
Brandon was never a fan of
The Admiral's Mistress.

49:00.716 --> 49:02.715
Okay.

49:02.716 --> 49:07.716
All I know is, he doesn't want
us to take this movie anywhere.

49:08.716 --> 49:10.716
He wants to close the books,

49:12.076 --> 49:14.716
which means the project really is dead.

49:17.239 --> 49:18.239
The fuck it is.

49:21.716 --> 49:23.715
Talk to Brandon.

49:23.716 --> 49:25.716
- There's always a way...
- No, not this time.

49:28.305 --> 49:29.716
I need this to work.

49:30.829 --> 49:32.716
I know it's hard...

49:32.717 --> 49:34.716
You don't fucking know!

49:37.710 --> 49:39.709
Don't forget I have a picture
of you playing dressup, April.

49:39.716 --> 49:41.965
And I will send that
to Brandon so fast...

49:41.972 --> 49:42.715
Seriously?

49:42.716 --> 49:45.715
I will drown the fucking
Internet in that image.

49:45.716 --> 49:48.715
You think the only reason
I fought for this movie

49:48.716 --> 49:49.716
is 'cause you were threatening me?

49:49.716 --> 49:50.716
Absolutely. I do.

49:50.717 --> 49:52.716
Fuck you.

49:59.716 --> 50:01.715
That's the spirit.

50:01.716 --> 50:03.715
I'm trying to help you.

50:03.716 --> 50:05.716
Well, you're doing a
horrible fucking job.

50:06.716 --> 50:07.716
Jesus.

50:09.716 --> 50:12.715
Were you already drunk
when you got here?

50:12.716 --> 50:14.716
Painkillers.

50:15.121 --> 50:16.217
What painkillers?

50:16.312 --> 50:18.275
Just shut up. Just let me fucking

50:18.282 --> 50:19.883
lie here for a minute. I'm so tired...

50:20.168 --> 50:21.168
No, no, no, no, no.

50:21.215 --> 50:22.215
Come on, come on, get up.

50:22.717 --> 50:24.716
Come on, off the floor! Get...

50:27.716 --> 50:28.716
Miles?

50:29.716 --> 50:31.716
Why are you bleeding?

50:34.573 --> 50:35.573
Miles?

50:37.470 --> 50:39.470
Miles? Miles!
