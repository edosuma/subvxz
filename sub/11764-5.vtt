WEBVTT

00:01.032 --> 00:02.703
OH. THANK YOU.

00:02.703 --> 00:04.705
в™Є GOOD MORNING в™Є

00:04.705 --> 00:06.177
(sighs) WHAT THE HELL?

00:06.177 --> 00:08.439
AW, YOU SAID THAT'D BE FUNNY.

00:08.439 --> 00:10.341
IT WAS.
LOOK HOW MAD SHE IS.

00:10.341 --> 00:13.484
MOM, YOU REMEMBER TED.

00:13.484 --> 00:15.046
MM, OKAY.

00:15.046 --> 00:17.188
THIS IS MY BAND.
WE'RE JUST PASSING THROUGH

00:17.188 --> 00:21.052
ON OUR WAY TO AUDITION
FOR DISNEY WORLD.

00:21.052 --> 00:27.198
(harmonizing)
в™Є WHEN YOU WISH UPON A STAR в™Є

00:27.198 --> 00:28.699
PLEASE, WOULD YOU STOP?
HUH?

00:28.699 --> 00:32.032
WHEN I RANK ALL THE THINGS
THAT MAKE ME WANNA DIE,

00:32.032 --> 00:37.208
IT GOES, UM, BOOKS, SNAKES,
PBS, UH, A CAPELLA.

00:37.208 --> 00:39.670
TED AND HIS BAND
NEEDED A PLACE TO CRASH

00:39.670 --> 00:41.172
ON THEIR WAY TO ORLANDO.

00:41.172 --> 00:43.544
THEY ASKED FOR A WEEK.
I SAID, "WHOA, WHOA, TEDDY.

00:43.544 --> 00:46.417
THREE DAYS, TOPS. FIVE, MAYBE."

00:47.478 --> 00:49.049
THEY'LL BE HERE A WEEK.

00:49.049 --> 00:50.721
IT'S GETTING FUNNIER.

00:50.721 --> 00:52.553
YEAH. ALL THE HOTELS ARE BOOKED.

00:52.553 --> 00:54.125
DAMN QUEBECERS.

00:54.125 --> 00:56.327
GULFHAVEN HAS A CRAB FESTIVAL
EVERY YEAR,

00:56.327 --> 01:00.731
AND FOR SOME REASON IT ATTRACTS
TONS OF TOURISTS FROM QUEBEC.

01:00.731 --> 01:01.732
IT'S ONE OF THOSE
UNEXPLAINABLE THINGS

01:01.732 --> 01:05.566
LIKE, YOU KNOW, MAGNETS,
VOLCANOES.

01:05.566 --> 01:07.468
THOSE ARE
ACTUALLY EXPLAINABLE.

01:07.468 --> 01:10.441
ALL RIGHT, TED, I ONLY HAVE
ONE EXTRA BED, SO...

01:10.441 --> 01:11.842
GUYS, WE GOT A BED!

01:11.842 --> 01:14.105
(Jules) WOW. (chuckles)

01:14.105 --> 01:16.207
OKAY, DON'T ANSWER MY PHONE.

01:16.207 --> 01:18.149
THERE ARE TOWELS UPSTAIRS.

01:18.149 --> 01:20.351
DON'T USE THEM.

01:20.351 --> 01:21.482
OTHER THAN THAT,
MAKE YOURSELVES AT HOME

01:21.482 --> 01:24.155
WHILE I GO GET READY
FOR WORK.

01:24.155 --> 01:25.516
в™Є HEIGH HO в™Є
в™Є HEIGH HO в™Є

01:25.516 --> 01:27.318
в™Є HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO в™Є
в™Є HO, HO, HO, HO в™Є

01:27.318 --> 01:29.660
в™Є IT'S OFF TO WORK WE GO в™Є
в™Є HEIGH, HEIGH, HEIGH, HEIGH в™Є

01:29.660 --> 01:31.462
(whistling)
(whispers) I HATE YOU.

01:31.462 --> 01:34.295
в™Є BOM, BOM, BOM, BOM в™Є
в™Є HEIGH HO,
HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO в™Є

01:34.295 --> 01:36.367
в™Є HEIGH HO, HEIGH HO в™Є
в™Є HEIGH, HEIGH в™Є

01:36.367 --> 01:41.432
в™Єв™Єв™Є

01:41.432 --> 01:43.434
(clink)

01:43.434 --> 01:45.176
MISSED AGAIN!

01:45.176 --> 01:47.838
NEW RULE--MISS TEN IN A ROW,
ANYONE WEARING A HELMET

01:47.838 --> 01:49.380
GETS A RACING STRIPE.

01:49.380 --> 01:52.183
HOW DOES THAT APPLY
TO ANYONE BUT ME?
IT DON'T.

01:52.183 --> 01:53.144
SPRAY PAINT TOUCHES THIS HELMET,

01:53.144 --> 01:55.846
AND I WILL MURDER YOU
OMAR-STYLE. I MEAN THAT,

01:55.846 --> 01:58.249
MAN TO MAN.
WOW.

01:58.249 --> 01:59.720
DID YOU JUST MAN-TO-MAN HIM?

01:59.720 --> 02:01.222
YOU JUST STEPPED THROUGH
A DOOR TODAY, BUBBY.
(slap)

02:01.222 --> 02:03.123
DON'T TOUCH MY ASS.
ALL RIGHT.

02:03.123 --> 02:06.397
MM. SO HOW GOES IT WITH
TRAV'S HOT PHOTOGRAPHY TEACHER?

02:06.397 --> 02:08.199
AH. (blows raspberry)

02:08.199 --> 02:09.200
WHAT? WHEN I LEFT
YOU TWO YESTERDAY,

02:09.200 --> 02:11.162
YOU WERE ALL GOOGLY-EYED.

02:11.162 --> 02:12.203
SHORTLY AFTER THAT,

02:12.203 --> 02:14.565
IT WAS LIKE A TORPEDO
RIGHT INTO THE CRAPPER.

02:14.565 --> 02:18.909
SO... WHAT'S YOUR SIGN?

02:18.909 --> 02:21.172
UM, CAPRICORN.
WHAT'S YOURS?

02:21.172 --> 02:22.243
DON'T GOT ONE.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.574
WHERE YOU FROM?

02:23.574 --> 02:25.176
FRANCE. YOU?

02:25.176 --> 02:26.217
FRANCE.
REALLY?

02:26.217 --> 02:28.349
NO.

02:31.322 --> 02:33.254
SHE JUST RAN OFF?

02:33.254 --> 02:34.425
SHE'S ALLERGIC TO BEES.

02:34.425 --> 02:36.187
(inhales sharply)
DID I LEAVE THAT PART OUT?

02:36.187 --> 02:37.428
YEAH.

02:37.428 --> 02:39.290
(bees buzzing loudly)
NO, NO! OH, MY GOD.

02:39.290 --> 02:40.431
OH, GOD.

02:40.431 --> 02:43.163
YEAH, I THOUGHT THERE WAS
SOMETHING THERE, YOU KNOW?

02:43.163 --> 02:45.165
BUT I BLEW IT.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.237
(coin clatters)

02:46.237 --> 02:47.167
(pops lips)

02:47.167 --> 02:49.740
OKAY, WE HAVE TO HELP BOBBY
GET THIS GIRL.

02:49.740 --> 02:52.203
HE SEEMS TO DO FINE
GETTING GIRLS ON HIS OWN.

02:52.203 --> 02:54.475
YEAH, HE WAS AWESOME AT IT
WHEN YOU GUYS WERE MARRIED.

02:54.475 --> 02:56.947
OH, SO SWEET.
BUT THAT WAS JUST SEX.

02:56.947 --> 02:58.579
HE DIDN'T CARE
ABOUT THOSE WOMEN.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.581
THAT'S WHY IT DIDN'T HURT
SO MUCH.

03:00.581 --> 03:02.413
REALLY?
NO, IT DESTROYED ME.

03:02.413 --> 03:03.914
LOOK. (sighs)

03:03.914 --> 03:06.817
WHEN BOBBY REALLY LIKES A GIRL,
HE GET SO NERVOUS AND AWKWARD,

03:06.817 --> 03:09.189
THAT EVEN HIS GIBBERISH
GETS WORSE.

03:09.189 --> 03:11.392
THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.
OR AS BOBBY WOULD SAY...

03:11.392 --> 03:12.923
(imitates Bobby)
"DAZ IMPRAZZIBLE."

03:12.923 --> 03:15.666
(snorts)
OKAY, WE JUST GOTTA GET HIM
TO THAT FIRST KISS,

03:15.666 --> 03:17.498
'CAUSE AFTER THE FIRST KISS,
ALL OF HIS NERVES MELT AWAY,

03:17.498 --> 03:20.231
AND HE GETS BACK TO HIS
CHARMING SELF. OKAY, WHO'S IN?

03:20.231 --> 03:21.232
ME!
I AM.

03:21.232 --> 03:22.603
SO OUT.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.835
YOU KNOW, WHEN BOBBY AND I
FIRST MET,

03:24.835 --> 03:28.239
HE COULDN'T TALK TO ME,
BUT I THOUGHT HE WAS SO HOT,

03:28.239 --> 03:30.611
THAT I GRABBED HIS RAT TAIL
AND I SAID,

03:30.611 --> 03:33.414
"SPIT OUT YOUR DIP.
I'M COMING IN."

03:33.414 --> 03:34.915
AW!

03:34.915 --> 03:36.417
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
AFTER THAT KISS?

03:36.417 --> 03:38.919
HE PUT A BABY IN YOU?
NO, THAT WAS A FEW DAYS LATER.

03:38.919 --> 03:41.952
I LOVE YOU, SWEETIE.
(groans)

03:41.952 --> 03:43.424
HE SMILED AND HE SAID...
(imitates Bobby)

03:43.424 --> 03:45.756
"WELL, THAT WAS FUN.
WANNA DO IT AGAIN?"

03:45.756 --> 03:47.398
THAT IS SO SEXY.

03:47.398 --> 03:49.430
AND I DID KISS BOBBY AGAIN

03:49.430 --> 03:52.703
BECAUSE HE IS THE BEST KISSER
I HAVE EVER BEEN WITH.

03:52.703 --> 03:54.865
WHAT, SO I'M ONLY SECOND BEST?
(chuckles)

03:54.865 --> 03:56.767
YEAH. (under breath) SEVENTH.

03:56.767 --> 03:59.370
UM, DID YOU SAY "SECOND"
OR "SEVENTH"?

03:59.370 --> 04:00.771
(laughs)
OKAY, LET'S DO THIS!

04:00.771 --> 04:02.273
WHOO!

04:04.445 --> 04:06.447
(door closes)

04:06.447 --> 04:08.949
(indistinct conversations)

04:10.250 --> 04:11.452
(Jules laughs)

04:11.452 --> 04:14.525
JULES, YOU LAUGH
AT THAT T-SHIRT EVERY YEAR.

04:14.525 --> 04:16.457
I CAN'T HELP IT.
IT'S FUNNY.

04:16.457 --> 04:20.831
UGH! THANKS TO MY ANKLE MONITOR,
I CAN'T LEAVE THIS DUMB TOWN.

04:20.831 --> 04:22.963
IT'S SO CROWDED.
THERE'S NOWHERE FOR US TO SIT.

04:22.963 --> 04:24.995
STUPID QUEBECERS!

04:24.995 --> 04:27.538
HEY, GO SEE IF THE PEOPLE
AT THAT TABLE ARE FRIENDLY.

04:27.538 --> 04:29.970
ON IT.

04:29.970 --> 04:31.472
THAT'S WHY I BROUGHT TOM.

04:31.472 --> 04:33.273
HE IS JUST SO WEIRD,
THAT WHEN HE TALKS TO PEOPLE,

04:33.273 --> 04:36.977
THEY JUST MOVE AWAY.
HE'S A GROUP EXPLODER. WATCH.
OH.

04:36.977 --> 04:38.879
HEY, ANY, UH, CRAB FANS
IN THE HOUSE?

04:38.879 --> 04:41.382
(imitates explosion)

04:41.382 --> 04:43.354
IT'S A GIFT.

04:43.354 --> 04:45.316
(both sigh)

04:45.316 --> 04:48.419
OOH, I COULD REALLY GO
FOR SOME HOT WINGS.

04:48.419 --> 04:50.691
I LOVE SPICY FOOD SO HARD!

04:50.691 --> 04:52.923
I THINK IT'S BECAUSE MY MOM
GAVE BIRTH TO ME

04:52.923 --> 04:54.765
AFTER A NIGHT
OF POUNDING BLOODY MARYS

04:54.765 --> 04:56.367
AT A WHITESNAKE AFTER PARTY.

04:56.367 --> 05:00.831
I WAS A JACUZZI BABY--
BORN AND CONCEIVED IN ONE.

05:00.831 --> 05:05.436
BOOKS, SNAKES, PBS, A CAPELLA,
THAT STORY.

05:07.608 --> 05:11.311
(laughs) GOOD ONE, SHIRT.

05:11.311 --> 05:14.485
LADIES, SO, UH,
YOU WANTED TO TALK?

05:14.485 --> 05:17.418
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT ANGIE, SO...

05:17.418 --> 05:19.790
WHAT WOULD YOU SAY IF I SET UP
THE PERFECT DATE

05:19.790 --> 05:22.593
FOR THE TWO OF YOU,
AND YOU BARELY HAVE TO TALK?

05:22.593 --> 05:24.425
WELL,
COULD THAT ACTUALLY WORK?

05:24.425 --> 05:26.056
IT'S GONNA GO LIKE THIS.

05:26.056 --> 05:28.799
(Jules) YOU'LL PICK HER UP.

05:28.799 --> 05:31.602
FLASH A SMILE...

05:31.602 --> 05:35.035
AND DRIVE
AS SHE DRINKS CHAMPAGNE.

05:37.337 --> 05:40.110
THEN YOU'LL STOP BY THE BOAT
WHERE YOU'LL PLAY PENNY CAN

05:40.110 --> 05:43.614
WITH YOUR ADORING SON
AND BEST BUDDY.

05:43.614 --> 05:49.420
NEXT, A ROMANTIC MOVIE WHERE
YOU WON'T HAVE TO TALK AT ALL.

05:49.420 --> 05:53.384
THEN DRINKS WITH FRIENDS WHO
WILL CARRY THE CONVERSATION.

05:53.384 --> 05:54.985
I'LL PROBABLY TELL
A FUNNY STORY

05:54.985 --> 05:56.957
THAT MAKES EVERYONE LAUGH.

05:56.957 --> 05:59.490
(all laughing)

05:59.490 --> 06:02.393
FINALLY,
A BEACH SUNSET SO BEAUTIFUL,

06:02.393 --> 06:04.935
IT WOULD RENDER ANYONE
SPEECHLESS.

06:04.935 --> 06:08.068
THAT'S WHEN SHE'LL LEAN IN
AND KISS YOU.

06:09.940 --> 06:12.102
AND YOU'LL SAY...

06:12.102 --> 06:15.546
THAT WAS FUN.
WANNA DO IT AGAIN?

06:19.810 --> 06:21.552
I TOLD YOU IT WOULD WORK.

06:21.552 --> 06:23.614
YEAH, YOU DID.

06:23.614 --> 06:24.955
WAIT. SO PART OF YOUR FANTASY

06:24.955 --> 06:27.918
INVOLVES BRAGGING TO ME
THAT IT WOULD WORK?
YEP.

06:27.918 --> 06:30.160
BUT I NEVER SAID
IT WOULDN'T WORK.
WHO CARES?

06:30.160 --> 06:32.062
WELL, BOBBY?

06:32.062 --> 06:34.064
I AM SO IN.
(gasps)

06:34.064 --> 06:36.427
(squeals)
GOT US ALL COFFEES.

06:36.427 --> 06:37.928
OH, THANK YOU, TOM. HEY, WOULD
YOU CHECK THE OTHER TABLES

06:37.928 --> 06:39.500
TO SEE IF THEY HAVE SUGAR?

06:39.500 --> 06:41.572
OH, NO PROBLEM.
THANKS.

06:43.073 --> 06:45.476
(Jules)
WATCH. IT'S LIKE FIREWORKS.

06:45.476 --> 06:47.478
(imitates explosion)

06:47.478 --> 06:49.780
(all) OOH.

06:49.780 --> 06:52.443
(Jules imitates explosion)

06:52.443 --> 06:53.514
(all) OOH.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.985
HERE COMES THE BIG FINISH.

06:54.985 --> 06:58.989
(imitating explosions)

06:58.989 --> 07:00.551
(all) AHH.

07:00.551 --> 07:01.522
THAT WAS GREAT!
WOW.

07:01.522 --> 07:03.724
AWESOME.

07:06.627 --> 07:07.628
в™Є BOM в™Є

07:07.628 --> 07:09.159
в™Є BOM в™Є
в™Є BOM в™Є

07:09.159 --> 07:11.031
(high-pitched voice) в™Є I GOT
NO STRINGS TO HOLD ME DOWN в™Є

07:11.031 --> 07:13.133
в™Є TO MAKE ME FRET
OR MAKE ME FROWN в™Є
в™Є BOM, BOM в™Є

07:13.133 --> 07:15.866
в™Є I HAD STRINGS,
BUT NOW I'M FREE в™Є
в™Є BOM, BOM, BOM в™Є

07:15.866 --> 07:18.438
в™Є THERE AIN'T NO STRINGS ON ME в™Є
в™Є BOP, BOP в™Є

07:18.438 --> 07:20.440
(ring, beep)
HELLO?

07:20.440 --> 07:23.143
(Jules)
Ted, look in the kitchen.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.175
I TOLD YOU NOT TO ANSWER
MY PHONE.

07:25.175 --> 07:27.117
(beep)
I TOLD YOU SHE MEANT IT!

07:27.117 --> 07:28.619
UHH!

07:28.619 --> 07:29.680
PEONS, UPSTAIRS.

07:29.680 --> 07:31.822
AND STAY OUT OF MY BEDROOM.

07:31.822 --> 07:34.655
I CAUGHT ONE OF THEM
SMELLING MY TOOTHBRUSH.

07:34.655 --> 07:36.126
I'M SURE THAT'S ALL HE DID.

07:36.126 --> 07:38.489
SHH, SHH! HEY, BOBBY.

07:38.489 --> 07:40.060
We are a go

07:40.060 --> 07:41.091
ON OPERATION KISS-THE-GIRL.

07:41.091 --> 07:43.133
OKAY, ARE YOU WEARING
YOUR SPORT COAT?

07:43.133 --> 07:44.535
I AM.

07:44.535 --> 07:46.567
GREAT. ARE YOU ALSO
WEARING PANTS?

07:46.567 --> 07:48.969
TURNING AROUND.
(tires squeal)

07:48.969 --> 07:51.802
THAT'S OKAY. THAT'S WHY I TOLD
YOU TO LEAVE TEN MINUTES EARLY.

07:51.802 --> 07:53.173
THANKS, CAP'N.
(beep)

07:53.173 --> 07:55.546
HE JUST CALLED ME "CAPTAIN."
(gasps)

07:55.546 --> 07:58.178
THAT MEANS YOU'RE MY SERGEANT.
MY SARGE!

07:58.178 --> 07:59.550
NOPE.

07:59.550 --> 08:03.053
NOT SARGE. I'M NOT HELPING.
CLASSIC SARGE.

08:03.053 --> 08:04.955
DO YOU THINK BOBBY'S GONNA BE
ABLE TO GET THROUGH THIS

08:04.955 --> 08:07.217
WITHOUT HAVING TO TALK
AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT?

08:07.217 --> 08:09.960
NO. BUT I COACHED
THE CRAP OUT OF HIM.

08:09.960 --> 08:12.963
I TOLD HIM TO START
BY COMPLIMENTING HER DRESS.

08:12.963 --> 08:14.494
HEY.

08:14.494 --> 08:18.128
WOW! MY GRANDMOTHER GOT BURIED
IN A DRESS JUST LIKE THAT.

08:18.128 --> 08:20.100
I CAN--I CAN GO CHANGE.

08:20.100 --> 08:23.834
NO! SHE'S NOT DEAD. I DON'T
EVEN KNOW WHY I SAID THAT.

08:31.111 --> 08:32.843
(Jules) THEN I SAID TO TALK
ABOUT SOMETHING INTERESTING...
(ice rattles)

08:32.843 --> 08:34.214
HE SAW ON TV.

08:34.214 --> 08:36.987
SO, UH,
YOU LIKE MANATEES?

08:36.987 --> 08:39.990
OH, I LOVE THEM.
OH, THAT PUDGY LITTLE FACE

08:39.990 --> 08:41.251
AND THOSE WHISKERS.

08:41.251 --> 08:42.623
YEAH.

08:42.623 --> 08:44.154
SO THEY'RE DYING.

08:44.154 --> 08:45.656
A BUTTLOAD WASHED UP
ON THE BEACH

08:45.656 --> 08:46.897
THE NEXT TOWN OVER.

08:46.897 --> 08:49.229
NO! OHH.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.232
NOTHING MAKES ME SADDER
THAN DEAD ANIMALS.

08:52.232 --> 08:54.264
FOR ME,
IT'S MY DEAD GRANDMA.

08:54.264 --> 08:57.568
SHE DID DIE. I JUST DIDN'T WANT
TO BRING YOU DOWN EARLIER.

08:57.568 --> 08:58.569
(bees buzzing loudly)

08:58.569 --> 08:59.640
OH! BEE!

08:59.640 --> 09:00.671
AAH!

09:00.671 --> 09:03.113
(screams)

09:03.113 --> 09:07.117
(sputters)
DID I SAY I LIKED
YOUR DRESS YET?

09:07.117 --> 09:09.119
THEN HE'S OFF TO THE BOAT,

09:09.119 --> 09:10.150
WHERE HE'LL PLAY PENNY CAN...
(tires squeal)

09:10.150 --> 09:11.752
WITH HIS ADORING SON
AND BEST BUDDY.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.924
RULES ARE RULES, NERD.

09:13.924 --> 09:16.186
AAH! HOW DO YOU LIKE THAT?

09:16.186 --> 09:17.958
AAH!

09:17.958 --> 09:20.631
I GOT THIS.

09:20.631 --> 09:21.762
WHAT? WHAT?

09:21.762 --> 09:23.794
WE'RE OVER! IT'S OVER!

09:23.794 --> 09:26.196
(lisping) HE SPRAYED PAINT
IN MY MOUTH!

09:26.196 --> 09:28.198
OH, HEY, MS. LeCLAIRE.

09:28.198 --> 09:29.600
HEY, TRAVIS.

09:29.600 --> 09:32.803
BOBBY, I DON'T UNDERSTAND
WHY YOU TOOK YOUR SHIRT OFF.

09:32.803 --> 09:34.274
WELL, YOU CAN'T BREAK UP A FIGHT
WITH YOUR SHIRT ON.

09:34.274 --> 09:36.576
I MEAN, HAVEN'T YOU EVER SEEN
"ROAD HOUSE"?

09:36.576 --> 09:39.579
WELL, I DON'T WANNA CALL YOU
A DUMMY OR ANYTHING, BUT DAMN.

09:41.211 --> 09:44.214
YOU CALLED HER DUMB?
MM-HMM.

09:44.214 --> 09:47.988
TELL HIM TO CALL HER "CHUNKY"
NEXT. CHICKS LOVE THAT.

09:47.988 --> 09:50.791
CALL HER A CHUNKY BITCH!

09:50.791 --> 09:52.923
BOBBY, GET TO THE MOVIES.

09:52.923 --> 09:54.094
ALL RIGHT.

09:54.094 --> 09:55.896
(sighs) YOU KNOW,
WEARING THIS HEADSET

09:55.896 --> 09:57.227
MAKES ME LOOK LIKE
SIGOURNEY WEAVER

09:57.227 --> 09:58.969
IN THAT MOVIE
WITH THE ALIEN.

09:58.969 --> 10:00.671
IT WAS CALLED "ALIEN."

10:00.671 --> 10:02.372
NO. I'M THINKING
OF A DIFFERENT MOVIE,

10:02.372 --> 10:04.875
YOU'RE NOT, BUT YOU KNOW WHAT'S
LAME ABOUT ACTION MOVIES?

10:04.875 --> 10:07.177
EVERYONE'S ALWAYS
RUNNING ANYWHERE.

10:07.177 --> 10:10.240
YEAH, BUT I DO LOVE THE WAY
TOM CRUISE RUNS IN MOVIES.

10:10.240 --> 10:13.113
YOU KNOW, HE GOES FASTER BECAUSE
HE KARATE-CHOPS THE AIR.

10:13.113 --> 10:14.214
(action movie music playing)
OH.

10:14.214 --> 10:16.086
(both exhaling deeply)

10:16.086 --> 10:18.749
IT FEELS FASTER.
LET'S TAKE A CURVE.

10:18.749 --> 10:20.651
(both continue exhaling deeply)

10:20.651 --> 10:23.023
(cell phone rings)

10:23.023 --> 10:24.194
HEY, JULES.

10:24.194 --> 10:27.658
(panting) BOBBY NEEDS TICKETS
TO AN EARLIER MOVIE.

10:27.658 --> 10:29.960
GOTCHA.

10:29.960 --> 10:31.261
SOLID HOT WINGS, MY FRIEND.

10:31.261 --> 10:34.805
REALLY WORKING UP A SWEAT.
(chuckles)

10:36.266 --> 10:40.010
(screams)

10:40.010 --> 10:41.942
GO FOR CAPTAIN.

10:41.942 --> 10:44.214
I GOT HOT SAUCE IN MY EYES!

10:44.214 --> 10:48.318
I CAN'T MAKE IT TO THE THEATER!
WHO IS CAPTAIN?

10:48.318 --> 10:51.351
YOU CAN DO THIS.
HONEY, I BELIEVE IN YOU.

10:51.351 --> 10:52.382
I DON'T!

10:52.382 --> 10:54.324
BACK TO YOUR SPOT!

10:54.324 --> 10:55.786
(panting) OKAY. OKAY.

10:55.786 --> 10:57.427
I CAN DO IT. I CAN DO IT.

10:57.427 --> 11:00.931
OH, GOD. OH, OH!
THAT IS VODKA!
(cup clatters)

11:00.931 --> 11:02.963
(gasps) OH! PLEASE, SIR,

11:02.963 --> 11:05.195
JUST PUSH ME IN THE DIRECTION
OF THE THEATER.

11:05.195 --> 11:06.396
JE SUIS DU QUEBEC.

11:06.396 --> 11:09.069
DAMN QUEBECERS!

11:09.069 --> 11:10.170
QUEBECERS!

11:10.170 --> 11:12.142
(crowd) QUEBECERS!

11:12.142 --> 11:13.273
QUEBECERS!

11:13.273 --> 11:15.375
(crying)

11:15.375 --> 11:16.977
THE MOVIE'S A NO-GO.

11:16.977 --> 11:18.248
THERE WAS
A CHICKEN WING DISASTER.

11:18.248 --> 11:20.050
I WILL EXPLAIN IT
ON THE WAY TO THE BAR.

11:20.050 --> 11:22.252
EXPLAIN THIS ON THE WAY,
GIRL.

11:24.354 --> 11:27.257
NOW THAT HAD TO BE BETTER
THAN SEVENTH.

11:27.257 --> 11:29.820
DO YOU REALLY THINK
WE SHOULD BE DOING THIS NOW?

11:29.820 --> 11:32.222
AT LEAST I'M THE BEST KISSER
IN THE ROOM, RIGHT?

11:32.222 --> 11:34.424
EH.
SERIOUSLY?

11:34.424 --> 11:37.898
WELL, I KISSED SARGE ONCE
ON NEW YEAR'S.

11:37.898 --> 11:40.270
I HAVE A MAGIC TONGUE.
THERE WERE TONGUES?

11:40.270 --> 11:43.133
WELL, IT WAS Y2K.
WE THOUGHT WE WERE GONNA DIE.

11:43.133 --> 11:46.376
LOT OF STUFF WENT DOWN
THAT NIGHT. LET'S GO.

11:54.384 --> 11:56.346
UNCOOL, GRAMPS!

11:56.346 --> 11:58.448
THAT'S LIKE THE FIFTH QUEBECER
TO COP A FEEL.

11:58.448 --> 12:00.720
(chuckles) DAZ-IMPRAZZIBLE.

12:00.720 --> 12:03.093
WHAT? SORRY.
SAY IT AGAIN... SLOWER?

12:03.093 --> 12:05.495
DAZ... IMPRAZZIBLE.

12:05.495 --> 12:07.057
GOOD GOD.

12:07.057 --> 12:08.899
HI. YOU MUST BE ANGIE.
HI.

12:08.899 --> 12:10.100
I'M BOBBY'S EX-WIFE JULES,

12:10.100 --> 12:11.501
AND THIS IS
BOBBY'S FRIEND GRAYSON,

12:11.501 --> 12:14.034
WHO'S ALSO MY FIANCE.

12:14.034 --> 12:17.467
SOMETIMES IT SOUNDS WEIRD
WHEN YOU SAY FACTS OUT LOUD.

12:17.467 --> 12:19.840
DAZ IMPRAZZIBLE.

12:19.840 --> 12:24.214
OH, YOU KNOW YOU CAN'T EAT SOUP
OUT OF A BREAD BOWL.

12:24.214 --> 12:25.375
YOU ALWAYS THINK THE SOUP
IS TOO HOT,

12:25.375 --> 12:28.418
THEN YOU EAT THE BOWL FIRST,
AND IT'S A DISASTER.

12:28.418 --> 12:30.350
YOU'RE NOT REALLY TELLING
A GROWN MAN HOW TO EAT, ARE YOU?

12:30.350 --> 12:33.023
NO,
BECAUSE THAT WOULD BE WEIRD.

12:33.023 --> 12:34.084
(chuckles)

12:34.084 --> 12:35.485
I DO HAVE A REALLY FUNNY STORY.

12:35.485 --> 12:38.889
HEY, ANGIE, DO I LOOK
LIKE A GOOD KISSER?

12:38.889 --> 12:42.192
DUDE, NOT NOW. BOBBY, NO.

12:42.192 --> 12:43.493
JUST A LITTLE BIT OFF THE RIM.

12:43.493 --> 12:44.965
IT'S NOT GONNA COMPROMISE
THE INFRASTRUCTURE.

12:44.965 --> 12:47.067
'CAUSE I'VE KISSED
A LOT OF PEOPLE.

12:47.067 --> 12:48.768
GOOD JOB?

12:48.768 --> 12:49.840
BUT I DON'T THINK ABOUT IT,
SEE,

12:49.840 --> 12:51.441
BECAUSE I DON'T LIVE
IN THE PAST.

12:51.441 --> 12:54.805
OH, I'M SORRY I REMEMBER
HOW PEOPLE KISS AND MAKE LOVE.

12:54.805 --> 12:56.376
WELL, WHY WOULD YOU THROW
"MAKE LOVE" IN THERE?

12:56.376 --> 12:58.508
THAT WAS A LITTLE WEIRD.
REALLY?

12:58.508 --> 13:00.380
SORRY.
WHY DON'T WE ALL JUST HAVE

13:00.380 --> 13:03.453
A GIANT MAKE-OUT PARTY
RIGHT HERE, HUH? RIGHT NOW.

13:03.453 --> 13:05.415
BAM, BAM, BAM, BAM,
BAM-AHH!

13:05.415 --> 13:06.887
PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME
KISS YOU.

13:06.887 --> 13:07.988
IT'S ENOUGH.

13:07.988 --> 13:09.789
BOBBY, NO!

13:09.789 --> 13:11.091
(mouth full) WHAT?

13:11.091 --> 13:12.522
OH, NO.

13:12.522 --> 13:15.295
(screams) OH! IT'S HOT!
IT'S HOT!

13:15.295 --> 13:19.229
GIVE ME THAT! OW, OW, OW!
OH! OW, OW! I...

13:19.229 --> 13:21.171
OW, OW, OW, OH, I REALLY...

13:21.171 --> 13:22.933
HOT!

13:28.939 --> 13:30.280
NICE GAMS.

13:30.280 --> 13:32.182
YOU, UH, PLAY SOCCER?

13:32.182 --> 13:35.545
UM, TOM, LESS CREEPY.
MORE DOCTOR-Y.

13:35.545 --> 13:39.119
OH, RIGHT.
UH, THE BURNS ARE MINOR.

13:39.119 --> 13:40.390
NO, NO, NO,
IT'S OVER NOW, TOM.

13:40.390 --> 13:41.952
(sighs) OKAY.

13:41.952 --> 13:43.253
I CAN'T BELIEVE I SPILLED SOUP

13:43.253 --> 13:46.826
ALL OVER THAT, UH,
CHINESE TATTOO ON YOUR THIGH.

13:46.826 --> 13:48.098
IT'S FINE, REALLY.

13:48.098 --> 13:49.499
WHAT THE HELL DOES THAT MEAN?

13:49.499 --> 13:52.502
OH, IT MEANS VEGAS.
I AM NOT PROUD OF IT.

13:52.502 --> 13:55.605
ALL RIGHT, VEGAS, LET'S, UH,
LET'S GET YOU SOME WINE.

13:57.267 --> 13:59.409
(lowered voice) WOULD YOU STOP?
IT'S GOING GREAT.

13:59.409 --> 14:01.571
JUST GET HER TO THE BEACH.

14:01.571 --> 14:03.173
WHAT DO YOU MEAN
THERE'S NO SPOTS AT THE BEACH?

14:03.173 --> 14:04.414
IT'S A BEACH!

14:04.414 --> 14:06.516
IT'S FULL OF QUEBECERS!

14:06.516 --> 14:09.379
FIND A SPOT, DAMN IT!

14:09.379 --> 14:10.580
HAVE YOU EVEN MOVED?

14:10.580 --> 14:12.582
NOPE. I EVEN NAPPED HERE.

14:12.582 --> 14:15.525
MY EYES STILL REALLY HURT!

14:15.525 --> 14:17.257
WHAT'S UP WITH THE COP CAR?

14:17.257 --> 14:18.258
(police radio chatter)

14:18.258 --> 14:19.629
(rapid beeping)
MY LIGHT'S ON!

14:19.629 --> 14:21.231
IS THIS BEACH ACROSS TOWN LINES?

14:21.231 --> 14:22.362
UH, WAY OVER.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.364
AAH!

14:24.364 --> 14:25.936
SLIDE!

14:25.936 --> 14:27.467
OHH!
OHH! SHE'S DOWN.

14:27.467 --> 14:30.901
STUPID CANADIAN KIDS
AND YOUR HOLES!

14:30.901 --> 14:33.273
I'M GONNA GO HELP HER WITH
THE COPS. YOU FIND A SPOT.

14:33.273 --> 14:34.474
BUT I CAN'T CARRY ALL THIS.

14:34.474 --> 14:35.976
DO IT FOR BOBBY!

14:35.976 --> 14:39.409
(weakly) DO IT FOR BOBBY.
DO IT FOR BOBBY.

14:39.409 --> 14:40.880
OHH!

14:40.880 --> 14:44.554
(grunts)

14:44.554 --> 14:46.456
THERE!

14:48.288 --> 14:49.889
(gasps)

14:49.889 --> 14:51.221
MY THIGH BURNS ARE
STARTING TO STING A LITTLE.

14:51.221 --> 14:52.562
(sighs)

14:52.562 --> 14:56.526
OH. HERE.
USE THIS ICE BUCKET.

14:56.526 --> 14:57.567
(ice rattles)

14:57.567 --> 15:01.631
OH. YEAH.

15:01.631 --> 15:04.134
(sighs) WOW.

15:04.134 --> 15:06.476
IT'S REALLY BEAUTIFUL,
ISN'T IT?

15:10.981 --> 15:12.412
HEY, WHAT ARE THOSE DARK THINGS
DOWN BY THE WATER?

15:12.412 --> 15:14.014
ARE THEY ROCKS?

15:14.014 --> 15:17.417
I DON'T THINK SO.
THERE'S SEAGULLS EATING 'EM.
OH, GOD.

15:17.417 --> 15:22.352
OH, THEY'RE DEAD MANATEES.
THEY'RE EVERYWHERE.
(ice rattles)

15:22.352 --> 15:24.924
YOU DID A REAL GOOD THING
TRYING TO SAVE THAT ANIMAL.

15:24.924 --> 15:28.398
SO SORRY
YOU HAD TO WATCH IT DIE.

15:28.398 --> 15:30.130
I SAW HIS SOUL
LEAVE HIS EYES.

15:30.130 --> 15:31.701
YOU FOLKS SHOULD GO.

15:31.701 --> 15:34.564
THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE SOON
TO CHAINSAW THE CARCASS,

15:34.564 --> 15:38.068
AND ONCE YOU SEE THAT,
YOU CANNOT UN-SEE IT. (chuckles)

15:38.068 --> 15:40.140
OH, WILL CHAMPAGNE HELP?

15:42.312 --> 15:45.075
(voice breaks) NO.

15:45.075 --> 15:47.277
I DON'T THINK YOU'D EVEN NEED
A CHAINSAW FOR THAT.

15:47.277 --> 15:48.678
THAT THING'S SO ROTTEN,

15:48.678 --> 15:50.220
YOU COULD PROBABLY JUST
KARATE-CHOP RIGHT THROUGH IT.

15:52.682 --> 15:54.954
WHY WOULD YOU LET HER
GO HOME?

15:54.954 --> 15:58.028
BECAUSE SHE WAS COVERED
IN MANATEE BLOOD.

15:58.028 --> 16:00.960
THAT WAS THE WORST DATE EVER.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.662
WAIT. BOBBY!

16:06.666 --> 16:08.968
I'M TRYING LESS LIP PRESSURE.
THOUGHTS?

16:08.968 --> 16:11.001
OKAY, FINE.
IF THIS IS GONNA STOP YOU

16:11.001 --> 16:13.203
FROM BEING
AN INSECURE LITTLE BABY,

16:13.203 --> 16:16.576
YOU'RE THE KISS MASTER!
HAPPY?

16:18.678 --> 16:20.980
(laughs) YES!

16:20.980 --> 16:22.512
в™Є KISS MASTER IN THE HIZZ-OUSE в™Є

16:22.512 --> 16:23.983
BURN.

16:23.983 --> 16:27.717
OKAY, I'M NOT GIVING UP.
I'M GONNA GO GET BOBBY.

16:27.717 --> 16:30.320
YOU ARE GOING TO GET TRAVIS
AT THE POLICE STATION

16:30.320 --> 16:31.691
AND BAIL OUT LAURIE.

16:31.691 --> 16:34.664
OH, AND GET A BURRITO BECAUSE
SHE'S ALWAYS HUNGRY IN JAIL.

16:34.664 --> 16:36.726
KISS MASTER OUT.

16:36.726 --> 16:38.698
SARGE, GO GET ANGIE.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.201
STILL NOT SARGE.
STILL NOT A HELPER.
(door opens)

16:41.201 --> 16:42.302
(door closes)
TO ME, PEOPLE ARE JUST

16:42.302 --> 16:45.705
BAGS OF SKIN
THAT SLOW DOWN MY DAY.

16:45.705 --> 16:49.339
LOOK, I KNOW YOU HAVE
A SECRET SOFT SPOT FOR BOBBY.

16:50.540 --> 16:53.313
YOUR FRIEND NEEDS YOU.

16:53.313 --> 16:56.416
I HOPE YOU DO
THE RIGHT THING.

16:56.416 --> 16:59.049
(sighs)

16:59.049 --> 16:59.789
DAMN IT.

16:59.789 --> 17:01.521
(glass clatters)

17:01.521 --> 17:04.154
OH. (gasps)

17:04.154 --> 17:05.795
BLONDIE?

17:05.795 --> 17:07.697
OW.
OH. YEAH.

17:07.697 --> 17:09.129
I KNOW THIS IS WEIRD,

17:09.129 --> 17:11.431
AND YOU PROBABLY HAVE
BLISTERS ON YOUR THIGHS.

17:11.431 --> 17:12.602
YEAH, BIG SUCKERS.

17:12.602 --> 17:14.804
(chuckles)

17:14.804 --> 17:16.536
BUT BOBBY IS A GREAT GUY,
AND THAT'S COMING

17:16.536 --> 17:18.368
FROM SOMEONE THAT HAS
A BROKEN BOTTLE FOR A HEART,

17:18.368 --> 17:21.311
SO JUST COME WITH ME
AND GIVE HIM ANOTHER CHANCE.

17:21.311 --> 17:24.314
I'D GO, BUT... UHH.
I CAN'T EVEN WALK.

17:24.314 --> 17:26.146
FINE. GET ON MY BACK.

17:26.146 --> 17:27.147
GO!

17:27.147 --> 17:28.678
AAH! OOH! OOH!

17:28.678 --> 17:30.250
WHO ARE YOU?

17:30.250 --> 17:33.052
I'M SARGE. HUH! HUH! HOO!

17:34.754 --> 17:36.156
(whispers) OH, BOY.

17:36.156 --> 17:38.458
(mouth full) DON'T SAY ANYTHING.
I NEED THIS.

17:38.458 --> 17:40.830
ALL RIGHT. I'M TAKING YOU
TO MEET ANGIE.

17:40.830 --> 17:41.831
OH, NO WAY.

17:41.831 --> 17:44.634
I KNOW THIS HAS BEEN
A HORRIBLE DAY. I...

17:44.634 --> 17:47.837
(Bobby and Jules laugh)
