[theme music]

00:07.675 --> 00:10.711
OK, he's in his car
seat and ready to roll.

00:10.744 --> 00:13.347
Look at little
Jerry Garcia Conner.

00:13.381 --> 00:15.149
He's so cute and
content in the car.

00:15.183 --> 00:17.318
Yeah, we sure named him right.

00:17.351 --> 00:18.919
He's only happy when
he's on the road.

00:22.623 --> 00:24.392
OK, he's starting to fuss.

00:24.425 --> 00:25.893
Come on, let's get
this thing loaded.

00:25.926 --> 00:29.063
[music playing]

00:53.821 --> 00:57.158
Well, that ought to be
enough to get us to the mall.

00:57.191 --> 01:00.561
[theme music]

01:45.806 --> 01:48.041
Boy, I've never
seen him this happy.

01:48.075 --> 01:48.876
Look at him drool.

01:52.746 --> 01:54.215
Boy, what a cool day.

01:54.248 --> 01:55.783
For the first time
in two weeks, Jerry

01:55.816 --> 01:58.452
hasn't been cranky or
clamping onto my breast

01:58.486 --> 02:00.521
every two seconds.

02:00.554 --> 02:02.590
Now if a car ride could
just do the same for Dan.

02:05.726 --> 02:08.462
I know-- we ought to go to that
big outlet all up in Elgin.

02:08.496 --> 02:10.431
Elgin?
That's an hour away.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.499
So?

02:11.532 --> 02:13.000
How would you rather
spend the next hour?

02:13.033 --> 02:15.236
A peaceful drive in
the country, or back

02:15.269 --> 02:18.306
at my place with gray
roots and a screaming baby?

02:18.339 --> 02:20.741
Can we discuss it before
you make up my mind?

02:20.774 --> 02:23.411
There has to be someplace
closer than that.

02:23.444 --> 02:25.813
Well, Jerry's happy,
and that makes me happy.

02:25.846 --> 02:30.218
We want to go to
Elgin, huh, honey?

02:30.251 --> 02:32.953
You're outvoted.

02:32.986 --> 02:35.789
I can't be outvoted by a baby.

02:35.823 --> 02:38.626
OK, then I'll outvote
you all by myself.

02:38.659 --> 02:41.529
[music playing]

02:51.138 --> 02:52.606
Hey, Deej.

02:52.640 --> 02:54.408
Are you playing a video game?

02:57.345 --> 02:58.546
No, Dad.

02:58.579 --> 03:00.714
I'm developing my
hand-eye coordination so I

03:00.748 --> 03:02.082
can be of use to the US Army.

03:07.255 --> 03:09.590
Let me put this another way--

03:09.623 --> 03:12.125
if you weren't here right now,
I would have the house to myself

03:12.159 --> 03:13.994
for the first time since--

03:14.027 --> 03:17.030
well, ever.

03:17.064 --> 03:22.903
So, uh, what's it gonna take?

03:22.936 --> 03:24.204
I'm writing down a number.

03:30.511 --> 03:33.213
Interesting.

03:33.247 --> 03:34.448
How does this grab you?

03:38.085 --> 03:40.454
We're gonna do business, or
you just gonna bust my chops?

03:47.060 --> 03:51.665
This thing you have done
for me, I will not forget.

03:51.699 --> 03:54.468
I'll be home by 8:00.
OK, 9:00.

03:57.871 --> 04:00.173
Yes!

04:00.207 --> 04:01.141
Yes!

04:01.174 --> 04:03.444
The house is mine!

04:03.477 --> 04:04.745
Mine, I tell you!

04:07.515 --> 04:08.816
First, comfort.

04:15.589 --> 04:18.191
Then, entertainment.

04:27.368 --> 04:30.137
Hey, guys.

04:30.170 --> 04:32.105
You two are going out
tonight, aren't you?

04:32.139 --> 04:33.541
Well, we weren't going to.

04:33.574 --> 04:37.511
Until we heard you
were giving away money.

04:37.545 --> 04:38.346
Thanks a lot, Deej!

04:46.354 --> 04:49.557
Your brother cleaned me out.
- OK, fine.

04:49.590 --> 04:51.925
Uh, David, why don't you
go get that 10,000-piece

04:51.959 --> 04:54.762
puzzle off the top shelf.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.663
Wait a minute.

04:55.696 --> 04:56.530
Wait.

04:56.564 --> 04:58.866
OK.

04:58.899 --> 05:02.370
If the waiter cuts that in
half, you're on your own.

05:02.403 --> 05:03.270
Oh, that's all right.

05:03.303 --> 05:04.137
I got plenty of cash.

05:15.383 --> 05:16.183
What's with wives?

05:20.087 --> 05:20.988
I don't get it, man.

05:21.021 --> 05:24.592
She kicked me out
of my own house.

05:24.625 --> 05:29.530
She kicked you out, so you
come to her parents' house?

05:29.563 --> 05:30.998
We're the ones
that taught her not

05:31.031 --> 05:34.134
to like you in the first place.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.370
You understand your wife, Dan?

05:36.404 --> 05:38.472
I understand that she's
gone for the first time

05:38.506 --> 05:42.109
since she had the baby, and I
finally have the opportunity

05:42.142 --> 05:45.112
to ponder world events,
religious philosophies,

05:45.145 --> 05:47.347
and see how many different
sounds my body can make.

05:51.519 --> 05:53.220
What are we watching?

05:53.253 --> 05:58.191
I was watching the game alone,
by myself, solo, party of one.

05:58.225 --> 06:00.027
Well, it's a good
thing I came over, then.

06:00.060 --> 06:03.330
[music playing]

06:06.099 --> 06:06.967
Hey, Roseanne.

06:07.000 --> 06:08.636
Hey, put these on.

06:08.669 --> 06:09.770
I'm gonna take our picture.

06:09.803 --> 06:11.405
We'll look just like
Thelma and Louise.

06:11.439 --> 06:12.506
Yeah.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.008
People do say I look
just like Geena Davis.

06:15.042 --> 06:16.510
And you look just
like Harvey Keitel.

06:35.729 --> 06:37.665
Uh, think you forgot this.

06:37.698 --> 06:40.634
Oh, forgot the bag
with all my stuff in it.

06:40.668 --> 06:41.569
All right.

06:41.602 --> 06:42.703
I'll tie it to the
back of the car,

06:42.736 --> 06:43.971
and we'll drag it
along behind us.

06:47.040 --> 06:49.843
Do you guys think
you can give me a ride?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.244
I'm kind of stranded.

06:51.278 --> 06:52.145
Stranded, huh?

06:52.179 --> 06:53.814
Well, that's awful.

06:53.847 --> 06:55.649
Excuse us, young woman.

06:58.486 --> 07:00.187
- Come on, Jackie.
- No.

07:00.220 --> 07:01.088
No!

07:01.121 --> 07:02.155
Don't even think about it.

07:02.189 --> 07:03.657
We have to go home.

07:03.691 --> 07:04.558
Look at her, Jackie.

07:04.592 --> 07:06.694
She looks so alone.

07:06.727 --> 07:08.462
She looks like an escapee.

07:11.665 --> 07:12.866
Can't just leave her here.

07:12.900 --> 07:15.536
Of course we can.

07:15.569 --> 07:18.005
So where you headed, miss?

07:18.038 --> 07:19.707
My name's Garland.

07:19.740 --> 07:21.008
I'm going to go Glenview.

07:21.041 --> 07:22.209
Glenview.

07:22.242 --> 07:23.611
That's, like, an
hour out of our way.

07:23.644 --> 07:24.512
Sorry.

07:24.545 --> 07:25.345
Good luck.

07:27.981 --> 07:28.916
Come on, Jackie.

07:28.949 --> 07:30.818
We got to take her with us.

07:30.851 --> 07:33.153
Just to be safe, go
on and pat her down.

07:33.186 --> 07:35.322
All right.

07:35.355 --> 07:41.428
Uh, missy, if you're gonna
be traveling with us, just

07:41.461 --> 07:42.763
to be safe, you know,
I'm gonna have to,

07:42.796 --> 07:46.500
uh, give you a little frisk.

07:46.534 --> 07:47.400
It's OK.

07:47.434 --> 07:48.802
She used to be a cop.

07:48.836 --> 07:51.238
At least, that's what she
told me when she did it to me.

07:53.841 --> 07:54.642
No problem.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.249
She's clean.

08:02.282 --> 08:05.686
[music playing]

08:13.260 --> 08:15.028
I set the thermostat on 70.

08:15.062 --> 08:19.199
I come back a few minutes later,
Becky's got it turned up to 78!

08:19.232 --> 08:22.169
You rig the thermostat
so that when it says 78,

08:22.202 --> 08:24.471
it's really 70.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.673
It's funny.

08:25.706 --> 08:28.008
I used to be happening
when my team was winning.

08:28.041 --> 08:29.677
You know, she forgets
to pay the bills

08:29.710 --> 08:30.944
for a couple of weeks.

08:30.978 --> 08:32.345
I mean, she's the one who
wants to handle the money.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.547
So, you know, handle it, lady!

08:41.555 --> 08:43.523
Darlene, come on.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.425
We are not going to
see "Showgirls" again.

08:45.458 --> 08:46.960
It's a bad movie.

08:46.994 --> 08:47.995
I know, David.

08:48.028 --> 08:49.229
It's the worst.

08:49.262 --> 08:50.831
Everything that Joe
Eszterhas writes

08:50.864 --> 08:54.201
is his revenge on some girl
who ignored him in high school.

08:54.234 --> 08:55.335
I've seen what the
guy looks like.

08:55.368 --> 08:58.739
I'm guessing he's got
1,000 more in him.

08:58.772 --> 09:01.108
But it embarrasses
me when you holler

09:01.141 --> 09:04.211
and throw things at the screen.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.113
Well, it embarrassed
me when you teared

09:06.146 --> 09:08.281
up at "Sleepless in Seattle."

09:08.315 --> 09:09.382
OK.

09:09.416 --> 09:11.018
But you know we can't go
back to the same theater

09:11.051 --> 09:12.886
where we saw "Basic Instinct."

09:12.920 --> 09:14.822
They have our pictures
up in the box office.

09:17.658 --> 09:18.759
OK, cool.

09:18.792 --> 09:20.628
And tomorrow, we'll
go see one of those

09:20.661 --> 09:22.763
sensitive foreign
little-boy-with-a-bicycle

09:22.796 --> 09:26.133
movies you like to see.

09:26.166 --> 09:28.468
And I'll bring a book.

09:28.501 --> 09:29.302
Cool.

09:35.008 --> 09:36.509
I don't believe it.

09:36.543 --> 09:39.880
They have a fight, and
they make up in a minute.

09:39.913 --> 09:41.048
There's a difference, Mark.

09:41.081 --> 09:43.751
What, that they're
younger than me and Becky?

09:43.784 --> 09:45.352
The reason that
they have a fight

09:45.385 --> 09:46.754
and then they make
up the next minute

09:46.787 --> 09:50.023
is that they are not married.

09:50.057 --> 09:51.424
Yeah, well, me and
Becky are married.

09:51.458 --> 09:53.026
So how is that different?

09:58.531 --> 10:01.001
When you're married for
20 years, you'll understand.

10:01.034 --> 10:03.070
What, you-- you guys have
been married for 20 years.

10:11.478 --> 10:12.279
That's right.

10:16.149 --> 10:22.322
Look, maybe if I tell you this,
it'll make you feel better.

10:22.355 --> 10:25.358
Let me explain to you
what it's like to be

10:25.392 --> 10:26.359
married to Mrs. Conner.

10:29.496 --> 10:31.364
We're gonna need some more beer.

10:31.398 --> 10:34.234
[music playing]

10:40.207 --> 10:42.943
So Garland, tell
us about your band.

10:42.976 --> 10:45.378
Oh, it's awesome.

10:45.412 --> 10:49.049
See, every member's
a riot girl like me.

10:49.082 --> 10:51.251
And we call ourselves
the Unit Shredders.

10:51.284 --> 10:52.352
Unit Shredders.

10:52.385 --> 10:53.420
What is unit shredders?

10:53.453 --> 10:54.321
Oh.

10:54.354 --> 10:55.255
Oh.

10:55.288 --> 10:56.189
Oh.

10:56.223 --> 10:57.124
Oh, that's cute.

11:00.360 --> 11:03.263
So you have no idea what
kind of stuff riot girls

11:03.296 --> 11:05.165
are out there screaming about.

11:05.198 --> 11:08.936
See, we're about taking
control, not trashing yourself,

11:08.969 --> 11:09.837

11:09.870 --> 11:13.640
Chicks that rock.

rock and roll, man.

Are band is doing it.

11:16.543 --> 11:18.678
A lot of bands are
doing it, actually.

11:18.712 --> 11:20.748
Have you ever heard of Red Ants?

11:20.781 --> 11:21.915
No.

11:21.949 --> 11:23.150

Oh, Bikini Kill.

Are they back together again?

11:32.559 --> 11:33.393
Put it in.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.228

OK.

11:36.730 --> 11:40.067
[music playing]

11:40.100 --> 11:42.502
Don't need you to
say we're cute.

11:42.535 --> 11:44.437
Don't need you to
say we're all right.

11:44.471 --> 11:47.841
Don't need your protection.

Turn it up.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.284
Well, see, Jackie she's got
a metal plate in her head.

11:57.317 --> 11:58.651
And it amplifies the sound.

11:58.685 --> 12:00.053
JACKIE: Yeah.

12:00.087 --> 12:01.755
Oh, here's my exit.

12:01.789 --> 12:05.392
Oh, we're playing up at this
storage unit up the street.

12:05.425 --> 12:09.329
I'd invite you,
but we're sold out.

12:18.705 --> 12:19.606

12:19.639 --> 12:20.673
Oh, thanks.

12:20.707 --> 12:22.609
I'm really sorry
about your head, dude.

12:22.642 --> 12:24.711
Yeah, well--

12:24.744 --> 12:25.745
See you later.

12:25.779 --> 12:26.546
Yeah.

12:31.584 --> 12:33.753
Know what she is?

12:33.787 --> 12:37.090
Nervy.
- No, Jackie.

12:37.124 --> 12:40.693
You know what she is?
20.

12:40.727 --> 12:43.030
That music is just noise.

12:43.063 --> 12:46.733
It's a bunch of kid making
screeching, loud, just noise.

12:46.766 --> 12:50.103
What happened to
music these days?

Who the hell are
you, Tipper Gore?

are pretty good lyrics.

you to say we're cute.

say we're all right.

13:01.648 --> 13:03.216
Don't need your protection.

13:03.250 --> 13:05.718
Don't need no kiss goodnight."

13:05.752 --> 13:08.021
Least these girls are
saying something, you know?

13:08.055 --> 13:10.557
Not like the music
we grew up with.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.092
Remember "Take a Letter Maria"?

13:12.125 --> 13:12.926
Oh.

13:15.628 --> 13:18.165
I love that song.

13:18.198 --> 13:20.901
You do not love that, Jackie.

13:20.934 --> 13:22.702
You ever listen to those words?

13:22.735 --> 13:26.006
It's about this guy, and
he's screwing his secretary.

13:26.039 --> 13:31.744
And she still has to take his
stinking letters to his wife.

13:31.778 --> 13:34.314
She's getting screwed twice.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.017
No, it's about the guy
finds out that the wife is--

13:37.050 --> 13:38.685
is cheating on him.

13:38.718 --> 13:39.719
Oh, yeah, sure.

13:39.752 --> 13:43.223
Go ahead, take the
guy's side, Jackie.

13:43.256 --> 13:45.425
OK, what about, um--

13:45.458 --> 13:48.261
oh, baby, baby, don't
get hooked on me.

13:48.295 --> 13:49.329
Remember that?

13:49.362 --> 13:51.698
He tells her that
he'll use her, and then

13:51.731 --> 13:54.067
he'll just set her free.

13:54.101 --> 13:56.236
Use me, I'll set you
on fire, you bastard.

14:01.241 --> 14:03.110
So all of our songs
couldn't have sucked.

14:03.143 --> 14:04.544
What about all those sweet guys?

14:04.577 --> 14:09.082
You know, like Donovan and
Jim Croce and the Beatles?

14:09.116 --> 14:12.219
Yeah, the Beatles were good.

14:12.252 --> 14:14.587
Remember they had that song
"Run for Your Life," though?

14:14.621 --> 14:15.956
Remember that song,
"Run for Your Life"?

14:15.989 --> 14:16.990
The Beatles?

14:17.024 --> 14:19.426
It goes, uh, he'd
rather see her dead

14:19.459 --> 14:22.529
than to be with another man.

14:22.562 --> 14:24.597
That's all them wife
beaters need is an anthem.

14:28.201 --> 14:29.970
All our music was guy music.

14:30.003 --> 14:31.604
Yeah.

14:31.638 --> 14:33.706
Never did hear a lot of
women on the radio, you know?

14:33.740 --> 14:37.777
Till Janis.
- Oh, well, thank god for Janis.

14:37.810 --> 14:42.315
You know, I-- I also
learned the truth at 17.

14:42.349 --> 14:43.616
Not Janis Ian, you idiot!

14:46.653 --> 14:48.055
Janis Joplin!

14:52.059 --> 14:53.927
I like that one,
you know, when Linda

14:53.961 --> 14:56.096
Ronstadt came out with
that song "Different Drum"?

14:56.129 --> 14:57.897
That was cool 'cause,
you know, for once,

14:57.931 --> 15:00.067
that was about the girl
leaving the relationship.

15:00.100 --> 15:01.134
You know who was really tough?

15:01.168 --> 15:02.035
Pat Benatar.

15:02.069 --> 15:03.503
Yeah.
And Joan Jett.

15:03.536 --> 15:04.571
Chrissie Hynde.
Chrissie Hynde.

15:04.604 --> 15:06.373
Oh, Chrissie Hynde.
Yeah, yeah.

15:06.406 --> 15:08.375
Oh, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait.

15:08.408 --> 15:09.476
I know we have this tape.

15:09.509 --> 15:10.944
Patti Smith.

15:10.978 --> 15:12.112
Remember?
Got it.

15:12.145 --> 15:13.046
Which?

15:13.080 --> 15:16.216
(SINGING) People
have the power.

15:16.249 --> 15:19.852
People have the power.

15:19.886 --> 15:22.189
Would you look at--
look at that-- look

15:22.222 --> 15:24.624
at that idiot trucker with
the naked woman mudflaps!

15:28.295 --> 15:29.329
That makes me mad.

15:29.362 --> 15:30.930
I want to get
mudflaps with a guy

15:30.964 --> 15:33.967
with a great big
beer gut hanging on.

15:34.001 --> 15:36.503
That's gross.

15:36.536 --> 15:37.470
Jackie!

15:37.504 --> 15:39.439
Jackie, look at
the bumper sticker!

15:39.472 --> 15:40.473
Save the whales.

15:40.507 --> 15:41.641
Harpoon a fat chick.

15:45.979 --> 15:49.549
Pull up to him, Jackie!

15:49.582 --> 15:51.418
We'll show him a
little bikini kill.

15:51.451 --> 15:54.487
I'm there, sister!

15:54.521 --> 15:55.388
Hey!

15:55.422 --> 15:56.523
Hey!

15:56.556 --> 15:58.458
So what, it's only the
most perfectly shaped

15:58.491 --> 16:01.094
women for you, you
big, hairy, toothless,

16:01.128 --> 16:02.095
sweaty, cross-eyed hog!

16:05.665 --> 16:08.135
MAN: Hey!

16:08.168 --> 16:12.605
Hey, show me your boobs!

16:12.639 --> 16:13.606
What's he doing?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.076
He's flipping us off back!

16:16.109 --> 16:19.012
Man, he's-- women rule, dirtbag!

16:30.023 --> 16:33.426
[beep]

16:39.466 --> 16:42.035
Crazy [beep].

16:42.069 --> 16:42.869
MAN: Hey!

16:47.440 --> 16:49.742
There's a motel
at the next exit!

16:49.776 --> 16:52.179
Kiss my fat chick [bleep]!

16:55.248 --> 17:00.187
MAN: If you can get your
fat [bleep] out of the car!

17:00.220 --> 17:01.154
ROSEANNE: Hey, stupid!

17:01.188 --> 17:03.656
Your lane ends in 10 feet!

17:03.690 --> 17:04.957
MAN: Hey, I'll show you 10 feet!

17:04.991 --> 17:05.858
I--

17:05.892 --> 17:06.759
[horn honking]

17:09.829 --> 17:10.697
Oh, my god.

17:10.730 --> 17:11.598
Oh, my god.

17:11.631 --> 17:12.865
He clipped a utility pole.

17:12.899 --> 17:14.467
Oh, what do we--

17:14.501 --> 17:16.736
do we stop and exchange
name and numbers?

17:16.769 --> 17:18.705
This is no time to try
to get a date, Jackie!

17:18.738 --> 17:19.706
Floor it!

17:19.739 --> 17:23.076
[music playing]

17:26.646 --> 17:28.581
Damn, we can't call Dan.

17:28.615 --> 17:30.317
Phone's dead.

17:30.350 --> 17:31.918
Can't believe what you did!

17:31.951 --> 17:34.053
What-- what did I do?

17:34.087 --> 17:38.525
I had an honest, intellectual
discussion with a trucker.

17:38.558 --> 17:40.527
We made him veer off the road!

17:40.560 --> 17:42.061
[siren]

17:42.095 --> 17:43.630
Oh, my god!
They found us!

17:43.663 --> 17:44.531
It's the heat.

17:44.564 --> 17:45.532
It's the fuzz.

17:45.565 --> 17:48.235
It's the man.

17:48.268 --> 17:50.637
Man, they found us fast.

17:50.670 --> 17:51.938
Too bad we didn't call them.

17:51.971 --> 17:54.341
Then we'd still have another
15 minutes to work with.

18:00.380 --> 18:01.848
Is there a problem
here, ladies?

18:01.881 --> 18:03.082
Oh, no.

18:03.116 --> 18:05.852
I just had to, uh, pull
over to, uh, nurse my baby.

18:05.885 --> 18:08.421
Whoa!

18:08.455 --> 18:10.423
Well, uh, we just got
word that a car that

18:10.457 --> 18:11.791
fits this description
was involved

18:11.824 --> 18:12.892
in an incident with a big rig.

18:12.925 --> 18:15.195
It seems that someone
made an obscene, uh,

18:15.228 --> 18:17.130
gesture to the driver, causing
him to veer off the road

18:17.164 --> 18:19.065
and smash into a utility pole.

18:19.098 --> 18:21.668
Does that, uh, sound familiar?

18:21.701 --> 18:30.810
As someone who has worn
the steel shield herself,

18:30.843 --> 18:32.345
I can assure you that
there's nothing more

18:32.379 --> 18:34.914
to talk about here, is there?

18:34.947 --> 18:38.351
Oh, you mean other than your
involvement in the incident?

18:38.385 --> 18:41.020
Hey, do we look like
the kind of women that

18:41.053 --> 18:43.990
would, uh, flip off a trucker?

18:44.023 --> 18:44.891
OK, we do.

18:44.924 --> 18:46.826
But it wasn't us, I swear.

18:46.859 --> 18:48.695
Well, lucky for you,
uh, nobody got hurt.

18:48.728 --> 18:50.797
But this is serious business.

18:50.830 --> 18:52.265
Yeah, you're right.

18:52.299 --> 18:54.201
Well, why don't we
discuss it right

18:54.234 --> 18:55.768
after I switch sides here?

18:55.802 --> 18:56.803
OK.

18:56.836 --> 18:58.405
OK, well, you know,
it seems that you

18:58.438 --> 18:59.806
two have learned your lesson.

18:59.839 --> 19:01.007
So why don't you just promise me
you'll drive straight home, OK?

19:01.040 --> 19:01.974
Yeah, you got it.

19:02.008 --> 19:02.975
You got it.

19:03.009 --> 19:04.677
We won't even stop
at the stop signs.

19:07.647 --> 19:12.352
You know, uh, I admire the
way you cops get up and hit

19:12.385 --> 19:13.786
those streets every
morning taking

19:13.820 --> 19:17.390
on those bloodthirsty,
crazy maniacs out there.

19:17.424 --> 19:19.559
That's nothing compared
to going home to my wife

19:19.592 --> 19:22.128
every night.

19:22.161 --> 19:25.398
[music playing]

19:30.303 --> 19:33.139
Mark, I don't want you
to get the wrong idea.

19:33.172 --> 19:36.476
I wouldn't trade a minute
of my time with Mrs. Conner.

19:36.509 --> 19:37.944
And when you're old
and beaten down,

19:37.977 --> 19:40.079
you'll get to say
the same thing.

19:40.112 --> 19:41.781
Yeah, but what
keeps you going?

19:41.814 --> 19:42.982
What do you look forward to?

19:43.015 --> 19:44.784
Oh, about once
every 20 years or so,

19:44.817 --> 19:46.753
you get to spend a
peaceful hour alone.

19:46.786 --> 19:48.821
Well, I guess I'll give
it another shot with Becky,

19:48.855 --> 19:51.491
and I'll give you
your hour and all.

19:51.524 --> 19:53.326
Thanks a lot, Mark.

19:53.360 --> 19:55.027
I'll do the same for you
when your hour comes up.

20:12.945 --> 20:13.813
(SINGING) Hot dogs.

20:13.846 --> 20:16.416
Armour hot dogs.

20:16.449 --> 20:19.452
What kind of kids
eat Armour hot dogs?

20:19.486 --> 20:24.424
Well, fat kids, skinny kids,
kids who climb on rocks.

20:24.457 --> 20:28.127
Tough kids, sissy kids,
even kids with chicken pox

20:28.160 --> 20:30.630
love hot dogs.

20:30.663 --> 20:32.665
I'm back.

20:32.699 --> 20:34.000
So soon?

20:34.033 --> 20:35.167
What do you mean so soon?

20:35.201 --> 20:36.303
It's almost 9 o'clock.

20:36.336 --> 20:37.270
Not on the west coast.

20:37.304 --> 20:39.506
Get back out there.

20:39.539 --> 20:41.207
So how'd it go out there?

20:41.240 --> 20:43.443
Well, if the cops don't
show up in the next half hour,

20:43.476 --> 20:44.344
pretty good.

20:44.377 --> 20:45.912
Hmm.

20:45.945 --> 20:46.879
Look at him.

20:46.913 --> 20:49.282
He's sleeping like a--

20:49.316 --> 20:50.216
like a baby.

20:50.249 --> 20:51.351
I guess that's where
that come from.

20:54.421 --> 20:55.822
What went on
around here tonight?

20:55.855 --> 20:56.923
Oh, nothing.

20:56.956 --> 20:59.792
I just had to teach Mark
how to handle Becky.

20:59.826 --> 21:01.294
Handle Becky?

21:01.328 --> 21:04.564
It's not like she's
a sports car, Dan.

21:04.597 --> 21:06.533
What went on on the road?

21:06.566 --> 21:10.770
There's a revolution out
there we didn't even know about.

21:10.803 --> 21:13.039
It's about women taking
control, you know?

21:13.072 --> 21:15.107
It's about being a riot girl.

21:15.141 --> 21:17.076
The oil light
went on, didn't it?

21:17.109 --> 21:18.378
No.

21:18.411 --> 21:22.382
A wake-up call went off, and
I heard it loud and clear.

21:29.088 --> 21:35.928
(SINGING) I had a hot
dog, an Armour hot dog.

21:35.962 --> 21:39.566
I wish I would have
ate my Armour hot dog.

21:39.599 --> 21:42.835
