02:14.887 --> 02:16.002
Boys.

02:18.247 --> 02:19.839
How are you? 

02:26.927 --> 02:28.997
Did you fuck me while I was out?

02:29.847 --> 02:33.203
- Hell, no.
- Well, quit looking at me like that.

02:35.807 --> 02:37.923
Except for talking a little cockeyed...

02:38.007 --> 02:40.202
Al is back to his accustomed self!

02:40.287 --> 02:43.085
What that is, speech,
crisis he went through...

02:43.167 --> 02:47.126
Al's body parts are showing
they're healing at different rates.

02:47.847 --> 02:52.284
Well, you talk cockeyed, boss,
all you want, long as you want...

02:52.367 --> 02:54.722
just so you're miserable and mean.

02:55.647 --> 02:57.524
How cockeyed do I look?

02:57.607 --> 03:01.361
Appropriately cockeyed for one
who's been through what you have...

03:01.447 --> 03:03.039
and then the fall you took.

03:03.487 --> 03:05.159
Bullock look worse?

03:05.247 --> 03:07.966
Naming your adversary
shows your memory is intact.

03:08.047 --> 03:10.515
You're gonna have to gather
all your fucking wiles, Al...

03:10.607 --> 03:13.485
'cause there's developments
that need interpretating on every front.

03:13.567 --> 03:16.718
Al is out of the development
interpretation business...

03:16.807 --> 03:18.559
for the short time being.

03:19.567 --> 03:22.286
Wu's got a big tall Celestial
that's haunting him.

03:22.367 --> 03:23.595
He's invisible.

03:23.687 --> 03:26.281
But Wu's convinced
he's from San Francisco.

03:26.367 --> 03:27.925
God damn it, Dan.

03:28.047 --> 03:32.086
Will you shut the fuck up
and let this man harbour his resources?

03:32.567 --> 03:34.523
You look in Chink's Alley?

03:35.447 --> 03:38.519
You see any big unfamiliar chink?

03:39.607 --> 03:43.441
Well, there ain't nothing to it, Al.
I just told you for a giggle.

03:43.607 --> 03:46.485
I mean, you know. Excitable Wu.

03:47.887 --> 03:49.605
So what else is new?

03:51.607 --> 03:52.722
Nothing special-

03:52.807 --> 03:55.685
Not a goddamn thing
that can't wait till you get well, boss.

03:57.407 --> 03:58.965
There is a bell...

03:59.647 --> 04:01.046
behind the bar.

04:01.127 --> 04:02.242
Absolutely.

04:02.327 --> 04:04.716
I know there is a bell.

04:04.807 --> 04:07.924
I'm telling you
I want it brought up here.

04:08.087 --> 04:09.600
Absolutely, Al.

04:12.847 --> 04:14.758
I best help.

04:15.087 --> 04:18.363
If there's anybody that can fuck up
the gathering of a bell, it's Johnny.

04:21.406 --> 04:23.443
- You want some water?
- Yeah.

04:23.927 --> 04:25.326
Fucking water.

04:37.207 --> 04:39.118
Don't be a fucking jerk.

04:45.847 --> 04:48.236
Your right eye is filled with blood.

04:49.687 --> 04:52.042
Can you use your right arm at all?

04:55.007 --> 04:56.804
Put your nose between my fingers...

04:56.887 --> 04:58.878
you'll find how much
I can use my fucking arm.

04:58.967 --> 05:01.879
That's good. That is a good sign, Al.

05:02.047 --> 05:04.322
- Don't bullshit me.
- I won't.

05:06.527 --> 05:09.087
I think you've had a small stroke...

05:09.167 --> 05:12.284
guessing maybe from the strain
of that stone.

05:13.887 --> 05:16.685
- You keep bullshitting them.
- I will.

05:16.887 --> 05:18.320
This gets out...

05:19.687 --> 05:21.245
I'll slit your fucking throat.

05:21.327 --> 05:25.115
- I wield a blade good with my left.
- It won't get out.

05:25.207 --> 05:29.120
- If I need it, you will fucking kill me.
- You stop that.

05:29.207 --> 05:30.879
You find me no better...

05:31.367 --> 05:33.244
you'll wish to hell I was fucking worse...

05:33.327 --> 05:35.363
'cause I wield a blade good with my left.

05:36.047 --> 05:39.164
Don't you put a fucking clock on this.

05:43.207 --> 05:44.003
Madam...

05:44.967 --> 05:47.435
in the chambers of my heart...

05:48.407 --> 05:49.840
beats a love...

05:49.927 --> 05:52.725
for every crooked timber of this...

05:52.807 --> 05:55.799
shitbox of a structure, this building.

05:56.967 --> 06:00.084
This building,
its warped floorboards and...

06:01.567 --> 06:02.636
Fie!

06:06.127 --> 06:08.960
Why, even in Richardson, my chef...

06:09.567 --> 06:12.798
my eyes see a beloved household pet...

06:13.047 --> 06:15.038
somehow walking upright.

06:18.247 --> 06:19.999
See in Richardson...

06:21.327 --> 06:24.125
a half-witted child, nonetheless adored.

06:26.247 --> 06:27.646
Mrs Garret.

06:27.727 --> 06:29.877
The very subject of my thoughts.

06:30.447 --> 06:34.679
May I borrow Richardson, please,
Mr Farnum, to escort me on an errand?

06:38.167 --> 06:41.284
Would you prefer
other company, ma'am?

06:41.727 --> 06:42.716
Less...

06:43.407 --> 06:45.045
mysterious?

06:47.207 --> 06:48.560
No, Mr Farnum.

06:49.767 --> 06:51.120
Richardson.

06:55.647 --> 06:58.684
I saved a lot.
I'll mop the rest in a moment.

06:58.967 --> 07:01.242
- Go with Mrs Garret.
- Thank you, Mr Farnum.

07:02.047 --> 07:03.685
Eyes down.

07:07.487 --> 07:09.876
Therefore, madam, as to your...

07:10.127 --> 07:14.405
generous offer to purchase my hotel,
I must gratefully decline.

07:18.927 --> 07:20.838
I take you for the man in charge.

07:20.927 --> 07:23.839
A.W. Merrick, sir,
owner, publisher, editor-in-chief...

07:23.927 --> 07:25.997
and, for the moment, sole reporter.

07:26.407 --> 07:30.116
Hugo Jarry, County Commissioner
appointed by Governor Pennington.

07:30.527 --> 07:32.836
- Of this county?
- Yes.

07:33.647 --> 07:36.798
- Has our county a name?
- Lawrence County.

07:37.207 --> 07:41.325
Ah, well, thank you
for that information and congratulations.

07:41.487 --> 07:43.876
Lawrence, Lawrence County.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.197
My father was a newspaperman.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.516
Lowell Sentinel-Bee.
I was raised among these contraptions.

07:50.687 --> 07:51.961
Were you?

07:52.887 --> 07:57.085
Great respect for the fourth estate.
Here's a statement to be printed.

08:02.287 --> 08:06.565
"As to ownership of the claims in the
newly constituted county of Lawrence...

08:06.647 --> 08:08.683
"as annexed to the Dakota Territory...

08:08.767 --> 08:11.884
"a presumption of legitimate title
shall obtain...

08:11.967 --> 08:13.798
"for claims worked...

08:13.887 --> 08:17.402
"actively and continuously
prior to amendment of the treaty...

08:17.487 --> 08:19.921
"with the Sioux Nation,
September, 1876.

08:20.247 --> 08:23.956
"This presumption
shall be subject to qualification...

08:24.367 --> 08:26.676
"according to mitigating facts. "

08:28.927 --> 08:30.838
If I discern this correctly, sir...

08:30.927 --> 08:33.486
this statement could be taken to mean...

08:34.366 --> 08:35.595
nothing.

08:36.246 --> 08:37.885
The statement continues.

08:39.727 --> 08:44.482
"New title will be awarded on claims
to which title is denied at set prices...

08:44.647 --> 08:48.117
"via lottery as conducted
by the County Commissioner. "

08:48.487 --> 08:51.320
I would be grateful
if that gets in your next edition.

08:51.447 --> 08:54.280
I must tell you, Commissioner,
that even with that last bit added...

08:54.367 --> 08:57.404
what exactly will or won't qualify...

08:57.647 --> 09:01.640
or mitigate the presumption
of ownership, eludes me.

09:01.767 --> 09:04.725
I didn't realise that was a bar
the statement had to hurdle.

09:05.727 --> 09:09.322
Without an accompanying explanation,
sir...

09:09.767 --> 09:12.998
this statement may work
an unsettling effect.

09:13.407 --> 09:16.126
In any case, sir,
being the commissioner of this county...

09:16.207 --> 09:17.560
and bidding you good day...

09:17.647 --> 09:20.366
I have presented you with that
to publish in your paper...

09:20.447 --> 09:22.677
as organ of record in this camp.

09:27.007 --> 09:28.076
Front page.

09:45.247 --> 09:47.886
"Trixie's to the hardware store,"
the big one said.

09:49.407 --> 09:51.841
May we go there then, Richardson?
Have you time?

09:51.927 --> 09:55.044
Yes. I only have stew to mop
before lunch.

10:09.807 --> 10:13.800
- I like you.
- Thank you, Richardson.

10:14.487 --> 10:15.920
You're pretty.

10:17.087 --> 10:19.362
Thank you very much.
And probably that's all...

10:19.447 --> 10:22.041
either of us needs to say
on that subject ever again.

10:28.567 --> 10:31.365
I'm uncertain how long I may be, so...

10:31.927 --> 10:33.724
I'll send you back to the hotel.

10:34.247 --> 10:39.002
Would you be so kind as to return this
to the pile outside the Gem?

10:43.127 --> 10:44.606
Thank you, Richardson.

10:46.087 --> 10:47.076
Goodbye.

10:50.927 --> 10:52.326
Cunt!

10:57.687 --> 10:59.040
Good morning.

11:02.967 --> 11:03.956
Morning.

11:04.087 --> 11:05.884
May we have a private word?

11:13.127 --> 11:15.197
Don't flee, don't flee.

11:15.407 --> 11:17.398
I'm going outside for a smoke.

11:22.407 --> 11:23.726
Gentlemen.

11:37.847 --> 11:38.996
You knocked up?

11:40.887 --> 11:43.845
- Why would you ask?
- You wouldn't have come here first...

11:43.927 --> 11:47.681
which means first you went to the Gem,
which you've never yet stepped foot in.

11:47.847 --> 11:49.200
I sent in Richardson.

11:49.287 --> 11:51.517
Meaning first you crossed
the thoroughfare with him...

11:51.607 --> 11:54.883
opening the possibility you're
only puking from the company you keep.

11:58.487 --> 12:00.398
I think I'm pregnant.

12:01.887 --> 12:03.081
We make tea...

12:05.807 --> 12:07.798
pennyroyal and cohosh...

12:09.047 --> 12:10.878
if that's what you come to find out.

12:11.807 --> 12:14.799
- I might very well die in delivery.
- Holy cow!

12:14.927 --> 12:18.442
I meant to say, more likely
than other women, I might die...

12:19.127 --> 12:22.324
because an ailment when I was little
shaped me for difficulty in childbirth.

12:22.447 --> 12:24.563
Why not take your tale of woe
to the Doc?

12:24.727 --> 12:27.082
I feel that Doctor Cochran judges me.

12:27.647 --> 12:29.558
Lucky, then, you come to me...

12:29.647 --> 12:32.366
that takes you to my bosom
and smoothes your hair...

12:32.447 --> 12:34.244
and tells you all will be well.

12:38.287 --> 12:40.482
I can tell you this much, Mrs Garret.

12:41.927 --> 12:43.280
If you take the tea...

12:44.727 --> 12:46.445
lay plenty of dope in...

12:47.487 --> 12:48.886
'cause I've killed seven.

12:50.607 --> 12:53.121
And every bleeding out
I laced on good and tight...

12:53.207 --> 12:55.163
and for a long fucking while after.

12:58.687 --> 13:00.359
I want children of my own.

13:06.967 --> 13:09.401
Let me finish up
my Jewish lessons here...

13:10.127 --> 13:11.321
then come find you.

13:12.327 --> 13:13.362
Thank you very much.

13:13.447 --> 13:15.722
- Thank you, Trixie.
- All right.

13:16.207 --> 13:18.596
- My name's Alma.
- I know your name.

13:38.647 --> 13:40.763
- Miss Isringhausen.
- Mr Adams.

13:42.047 --> 13:44.481
- May I collect a change of clothes?
- Of course.

13:53.687 --> 13:57.282
- I hope you slept well.
- I'm mortified to say I did.

13:57.447 --> 13:58.436
Mortified?

13:58.887 --> 14:01.037
Having done so
at the cost of your comfort.

14:01.127 --> 14:03.925
I sleep anywhere, ma'am.
I'm like a dog in that regard.

14:05.247 --> 14:07.363
We don't want you murdered
in your bed.

14:08.727 --> 14:11.195
Perhaps it was irrational,
my being so afraid.

14:11.927 --> 14:16.159
- That ain't a test fear's got to pass.
- I know she's had others done for.

14:16.807 --> 14:18.365
So you've said.

14:20.767 --> 14:23.281
- Anyways-
- May I know your given name?

14:23.527 --> 14:25.836
Silas, if I remember correct.

14:26.527 --> 14:29.405
You have shown charity
to one among strangers, Silas.

14:32.367 --> 14:34.244
Giving her great solace.

14:35.527 --> 14:36.596
Thank you.

14:36.687 --> 14:38.405
Or you're welcome, I guess.

14:39.807 --> 14:41.843
Thank you, Silas.

14:51.887 --> 14:53.525
And you're welcome.

15:01.487 --> 15:04.399
Hostetler.
It's the Nigger General Fields.

15:10.447 --> 15:12.915
Now you was to have had this horse
one week.

15:13.007 --> 15:16.204
Shit, Old Nugget here
is sound and spoilt.

15:17.087 --> 15:18.918
He's been living
on peppermints and apples...

15:19.007 --> 15:22.761
in the private stables
of a San Francisco dry goods big shot.

15:22.927 --> 15:25.839
Making you owing 17 weeks additional!

15:27.207 --> 15:30.517
Yeah, I was delivering emerald earrings
to Mrs Big Shot...

15:31.367 --> 15:34.404
and a diamond bracelet
and matching choker...

15:34.487 --> 15:36.682
to Mr Big Shot's mistress.

15:38.487 --> 15:40.079
$4 a week...

15:40.287 --> 15:42.403
times 17...

15:44.847 --> 15:45.836
is...

15:45.927 --> 15:48.077
Here, cipher the result
against this $100.

15:50.007 --> 15:52.646
$100...

15:53.047 --> 15:54.765
take away 68...

15:54.847 --> 15:56.838
Put the balance toward our future trade.

15:58.607 --> 16:01.405
- Owing General Nigger...
- Nigger General.

16:02.967 --> 16:04.798
...$32 credit.

16:06.087 --> 16:08.601
Being you was away,
maybe now you got a chance...

16:08.687 --> 16:10.723
to take off this half-ass uniform.

16:10.807 --> 16:12.923
Then who's gonna know
I'm the Nigger General?

16:13.007 --> 16:16.283
By your own telling,
you never was in no Union Army.

16:16.407 --> 16:21.083
This ain't the time or the place
to be drawing people's attention.

16:23.047 --> 16:25.038
Even for a goddamn fool.

16:25.127 --> 16:27.880
Yeah, well, I keep missing the place
where it'd be a good time.

16:27.967 --> 16:30.356
Must be my goddamn foolishness.

16:39.927 --> 16:42.885
You wouldn't suppose they'd be
salting the fucking find over there...

16:42.967 --> 16:44.320
now, would you, Doris?

16:44.527 --> 16:46.040
I don't understand.

16:46.127 --> 16:49.676
I was wondering if maybe
your new bosses Maddie and Joanie...

16:49.767 --> 16:51.883
are sending me more
than my proper share...

16:52.367 --> 16:56.155
giving me a false fucking impression
of how their pussy's selling.

16:56.807 --> 16:58.240
I don't know.

16:59.087 --> 17:02.602
'Cause this is...
This is fucking heavy action...

17:02.687 --> 17:05.281
for an operation ahead of itself
far as decor and location...

17:05.367 --> 17:07.198
and every other fucking aspect!

17:07.967 --> 17:10.196
It's mostly from just the one trick.

17:10.487 --> 17:14.195
- Which is who?
- I don't know his name.

17:15.087 --> 17:16.520
They call him Mr W.

17:19.727 --> 17:21.046
What does he look like?

17:21.567 --> 17:24.957
- I wouldn't know how to say.
- Oh, fucking mutt.

17:26.207 --> 17:28.436
- Is he tall or short?
- Tall.

17:28.527 --> 17:30.643
- Thin or fat?
- Thin.

17:31.887 --> 17:33.320
Good-looking, I guess.

17:33.407 --> 17:36.001
- Clean-shaved or bearded?
- Bearded.

17:38.127 --> 17:40.038
He threw me into a wall last night.

17:44.927 --> 17:46.565
Don't tell me.

17:50.527 --> 17:53.439
On what pretext, sweetheart?

17:54.127 --> 17:55.719
I looked at him.

17:56.647 --> 17:58.558
And that was against his instructions?

17:59.567 --> 18:01.558
He had all the girls facing the wall.

18:02.407 --> 18:04.238
And you peeked?

18:05.767 --> 18:08.998
Now was this... Was this more or less
a push to the wall...

18:09.367 --> 18:13.360
or did he fucking fling you, violent-like,
with more of the same in mind?

18:14.127 --> 18:15.446
Violent-like.

18:17.247 --> 18:18.236
Well...

18:19.207 --> 18:21.641
that's a man with a problem,
ain't it, Doris?

18:25.487 --> 18:26.886
Mr W.

18:29.327 --> 18:32.285
Jesus Christ,
can I be that fucking lucky?

18:36.767 --> 18:39.235
- Warm it up?
- Thank you.

18:44.127 --> 18:45.845
How did you sleep, Carrie?

18:47.047 --> 18:50.278
All right, I guess. How did you sleep?

18:53.287 --> 18:56.245
- All right.
- Are you guessing?

18:59.447 --> 19:01.483
I guess I'm guessing.

19:01.767 --> 19:02.836
Do your back?

19:04.407 --> 19:05.886
Yes, thank you.

19:13.807 --> 19:15.718
My trick got you upset.

19:16.887 --> 19:18.718
I was in with him the night before.

19:19.727 --> 19:23.242
- I guessed he took to watching.
- How did that work out?

19:24.127 --> 19:25.719
I guess he don't.

19:26.767 --> 19:28.405
Or, anyway, not that night.

19:29.327 --> 19:30.680
Or maybe just not me.

19:31.447 --> 19:33.438
Do you want to know
what I do with him?

19:35.007 --> 19:36.759
If you want to say.

19:39.927 --> 19:42.043
I get him off through his pants.

19:43.687 --> 19:46.201
Acting like my hand's my snatch.

19:49.207 --> 19:50.925
Reaching around behind you?

19:52.247 --> 19:55.683
- Behind me and between my legs.
- Through his pants?

19:56.327 --> 19:57.316
Yes.

19:58.047 --> 19:59.958
You don't put your hand inside?

20:04.247 --> 20:07.000
- Are you naked?
- Dressed.

20:08.767 --> 20:11.486
Except for my stockings
and my bloomers.

20:13.207 --> 20:15.163
You talk any special way?

20:18.447 --> 20:19.926
I remind him not to hit me.

20:25.127 --> 20:26.879
Do you want to be writing this down?

20:32.087 --> 20:35.159
Congratulations, Doc,
on your high and holy bullshit.

20:35.247 --> 20:38.364
It's water off a duck to some,
but others still got feelings.

20:39.807 --> 20:41.718
Of whom are we fucking speaking?

20:41.807 --> 20:45.846
One as might die in childbirth
more likely than us lucky others...

20:45.967 --> 20:48.162
but so sponged down
in your disapproval...

20:48.247 --> 20:52.445
when she was kicking the fucking dope,
she's afraid now to seek your care.

20:55.527 --> 20:59.076
- I'll call on her.
- Under some other fucking pretext.

20:59.567 --> 21:02.445
- All right.
- Mighty fucking big of you, Doc.

21:04.367 --> 21:08.838
You have about as miserable
a disposition as your employer.

21:08.967 --> 21:11.162
I ain't exclusive to him no more.

21:21.807 --> 21:23.206
Hey, now, Miss Lady.

21:24.287 --> 21:26.517
How much do you want for that bottle?

21:27.167 --> 21:29.635
What the fuck are you supposed to be?

21:30.087 --> 21:32.476
Currency still spends, ma'am.

21:33.287 --> 21:36.757
Is that
some dilapidated-type fucking uniform?

21:37.167 --> 21:39.283
I scouted for fucking Custer.

21:39.367 --> 21:42.325
A great man who would have
wanted you to sell me that bottle.

21:42.407 --> 21:45.046
He was no great fucking man!

21:45.127 --> 21:48.403
He was a long-haired cocksucker...

21:48.487 --> 21:52.196
that could have saved many lives
by more drinking...

21:52.767 --> 21:57.283
and stopped being so fucking ambitious,
and many still above ground...

21:57.527 --> 22:01.884
and not scalped by the fucking heathens
and their guts spread over the plains.

22:03.847 --> 22:06.202
You're a short nigger, aren't you?

22:08.287 --> 22:09.879
For a fact.

22:11.007 --> 22:12.645
My name's Jane.

22:13.807 --> 22:15.684
I'm the Nigger General Fields.

22:16.207 --> 22:17.481
Want a drink?

22:17.727 --> 22:19.797
I want to buy that bottle,
that's what I want.

22:19.887 --> 22:23.323
Well, you ain't buying it,
but you can have a fucking drink.

22:28.127 --> 22:29.162
Thanks.

22:34.847 --> 22:37.042
Don't fucking look around!

22:37.247 --> 22:39.477
I don't care who sees a nigger
drinking with me...

22:39.567 --> 22:42.365
or drinking from the same bottle
or how...

22:42.887 --> 22:45.003
stupid his fucking outfit is.

22:45.087 --> 22:47.760
This here is the epaulet
of a Union Army general.

22:48.807 --> 22:52.083
And this here is the ass
of a drunken shitbird.

22:55.487 --> 22:57.000
Finish this with me.

22:58.007 --> 23:02.319
If you can sit beside someone
and not stink or fart.

23:09.127 --> 23:11.436
I've been known to cut the odd fart...

23:14.247 --> 23:18.240
- but they've never stunk.
- I got the self-same gift.

23:19.247 --> 23:21.283
If I took advantage, I apologise.

23:22.367 --> 23:24.437
You took no more advantage
of me, Silas...

23:24.527 --> 23:27.200
than the Samaritan did
the traveller from Jerusalem.

23:29.367 --> 23:30.356
Good.

23:32.967 --> 23:34.923
I should tell you, Silas...

23:35.887 --> 23:39.038
that the Mr Swearengen
I've heard you say you work for...

23:39.847 --> 23:43.396
is named by Mrs Garret as her
instrument in her husband's murder.

23:43.727 --> 23:45.718
- Named by Mrs Garret?
- Yes.

23:45.887 --> 23:47.605
- As her instrument?
- Yes.

23:50.367 --> 23:52.039
Jesus Christ.

23:55.887 --> 23:58.481
- What's your first name?
- Alice.

23:58.767 --> 24:01.918
Well, Alice, your story don't get
less strange the more of it you tell.

24:02.007 --> 24:04.441
Because Mr Swearengen
wouldn't do such a thing?

24:05.127 --> 24:08.278
Generates a fucking strangeness
is her saying he was her hire.

24:09.727 --> 24:10.796
I see.

24:10.967 --> 24:13.162
Yeah, well,
that makes fucking one of us.

24:13.927 --> 24:16.566
Would you introduce me
to Mr Swearengen?

24:17.167 --> 24:18.566
You're asking me to?

24:19.487 --> 24:21.796
- You want to meet him?
- Please.

24:23.327 --> 24:26.046
Why do I feel lucky
we didn't meet across a poker table?

24:28.767 --> 24:31.042
Anyways,
he ain't up to chatting just now.

24:35.887 --> 24:37.320
Silas?

24:41.967 --> 24:44.720
Her bearing gives you suspicions
as to her health?

24:44.807 --> 24:46.365
No, not at all.

24:46.447 --> 24:49.439
My notes indicate that it had been
a year since her last exam...

24:49.527 --> 24:53.600
and with the day-long lull between
gunfights, I thought I'd have a look.

24:54.607 --> 24:55.596
I see.

24:56.087 --> 24:59.124
And she seems to be
coming along beautifully.

25:16.287 --> 25:19.802
Since I have cared for you as well...

25:20.007 --> 25:22.885
can I ask after your health?

25:26.327 --> 25:30.002
I continue relieved of the weakness
you treated me for.

25:30.687 --> 25:32.723
And you have nothing else to report?

25:34.047 --> 25:36.402
Thank you for examining Sofia.

25:41.807 --> 25:44.685
Folk wisdom and remedies
known to others in the camp...

25:44.767 --> 25:47.361
are often quite adequate...

25:47.447 --> 25:50.325
to the requirements of health.
And Trixie...

25:50.607 --> 25:52.040
for example...

25:52.807 --> 25:56.516
is a stalwart
and a reliable source of these.

25:56.607 --> 26:00.361
However, I do have
some particular competence...

26:00.447 --> 26:04.599
as to the implications
of anatomical anomalies...

26:05.007 --> 26:08.920
congenital or consequent
of previous illness...

26:09.007 --> 26:12.283
and I would hope
that you would avail yourself of this...

26:12.367 --> 26:17.077
notwithstanding my idiosyncrasies
and my defects of character.

26:38.807 --> 26:39.922
Please.

26:46.207 --> 26:48.198
My experience, Mr Wolcott...

26:48.807 --> 26:52.720
come to making restitution
for others' outlays, the rich can be tardy.

26:55.327 --> 26:59.161
I'm just satisfying myself that my
employer's getting what he's paying for.

26:59.247 --> 27:01.203
Bills of sale, drawn good and legal...

27:01.367 --> 27:03.756
signatures genuine and witnessed.

27:05.767 --> 27:08.406
- Join us, Commissioner.
- Gentlemen.

27:09.047 --> 27:12.835
Notice about the claims
is in your newspaper publisher's hands.

27:13.167 --> 27:16.637
That the Yankton statement may cause
unease among local claimholders...

27:16.727 --> 27:18.160
as to the security of their title...

27:18.247 --> 27:20.636
Mr Merrick found personally distressing.

27:20.927 --> 27:23.361
He found it wrong and unfair.

27:23.567 --> 27:27.196
- Was he looking for a bribe?
- No, he was not. I have a nose for that.

27:27.447 --> 27:29.802
In any case, he's manageable.

27:29.887 --> 27:32.162
I quite stared him down.

27:34.127 --> 27:37.756
We're just chewing the fat in here,
Leon, barge the fuck amongst us.

27:37.887 --> 27:40.765
Mr Merrick posted that statement
outside his office, Mr Tolliver.

27:40.847 --> 27:43.759
- Put out an extra, did he?
- No edition of the paper at all.

27:43.847 --> 27:47.157
Just the statement on the outside wall,
and people are fucking riled.

27:47.327 --> 27:50.239
- Riled or frightened?
- Riled, sir.

27:51.007 --> 27:53.475
That's the type of unsettlement
we ain't necessarily after.

27:53.567 --> 27:56.559
Wanting to know where he's at,
who the fuck he thinks he is.

27:57.687 --> 28:00.440
You want to manage this,
Commissioner, or shall I?

28:00.527 --> 28:02.119
You go on, Tolliver.

28:03.607 --> 28:05.563
Maybe take another bath.

28:10.727 --> 28:13.082
What in fuck's
that word supposed to mean?

28:13.647 --> 28:17.356
Mitigating, as applied to a presumption,
would mean to lessen...

28:17.487 --> 28:19.921
or soften strength or rigour.

28:20.007 --> 28:23.204
I ought to punch you in the fucking nose.

28:24.087 --> 28:25.566
Why would you punch me?

28:25.767 --> 28:27.598
You had him here, didn't you?

28:27.927 --> 28:31.636
Give him your fucking words
to print on your fucking machine!

28:32.327 --> 28:35.319
Which is short of saying
I should have forced him...

28:35.407 --> 28:37.443
to some purpose of my own?

28:37.527 --> 28:41.315
Show me where the cocksucker's at.
I won't fall short of force!

28:41.847 --> 28:43.519
Who convened the meeting, boys?

28:43.847 --> 28:47.044
New county commissioner
give Merrick a statement...

28:47.207 --> 28:49.880
mitigating us into an ass-fucking.

28:51.007 --> 28:52.156
Ouch.

28:52.647 --> 28:54.683
And then I yelled:

28:54.767 --> 28:57.361
"Put the fucking door down, Dan!"

29:02.727 --> 29:05.287
Doc said only what would jolly you, Al...

29:05.367 --> 29:08.086
but I do believe Mr Merrick
might be in the fucking soup.

29:08.167 --> 29:11.239
You have got one yawning
fucking chasm of a mouth on you!

29:11.567 --> 29:14.843
Fucking County Commissioner
made Mr Merrick post notice...

29:14.927 --> 29:18.556
titles of claims
to be decided case by case.

29:20.167 --> 29:21.998
The County Commissioner's
in the camp?

29:22.087 --> 29:24.681
Yeah. And that hooplehead Steve
is about to punch Merrick...

29:24.767 --> 29:28.157
for posting the notice, and I know
that you got a liking for Merrick.

29:29.207 --> 29:31.357
I want you
to stop thinking now, Johnny...

29:31.687 --> 29:33.996
and only answer the question
I'm gonna ask you.

29:34.207 --> 29:35.356
Yes, sir.

29:36.167 --> 29:37.805
Where's the Commissioner now?

29:38.087 --> 29:40.965
- The Commissioner or Mr Merrick?
- The Commissioner, Johnny.

29:41.047 --> 29:43.117
Where's the Commissioner?

29:43.607 --> 29:45.677
He's at Bella Union.
He moved over there.

29:45.767 --> 29:48.361
Jesus fucking Christ!

29:51.327 --> 29:52.680
Get Bullock.

29:52.967 --> 29:55.003
- Bullock?
- Bullock. Get Bullock.

29:56.207 --> 29:57.401
Yes, sir.

30:01.687 --> 30:04.997
May call the Sheriff in, huh,
fisticuffs between Merrick and Steve!

30:05.087 --> 30:07.476
Shut the fuck up, Johnny.
Help me get situated.

30:09.247 --> 30:12.205
Reads to me they're inclining towards
the present titleholders.

30:12.287 --> 30:14.517
But then they start to fucking mitigate!

30:20.647 --> 30:24.196
Yeah, they do get to mitigating,
this last part here.

30:25.087 --> 30:28.284
I guess my question is who of us here
didn't know what government was...

30:28.367 --> 30:29.561
before we came?

30:29.927 --> 30:32.361
Wasn't half our purpose coming
to get shed of the cocksucker?

30:32.447 --> 30:35.519
And here it catches up to us again
to do what's in its nature...

30:35.607 --> 30:37.120
to lie to us...

30:37.207 --> 30:40.643
and confuse us
and steal what we come to by toil...

30:40.727 --> 30:43.287
and being lucky
just once in our fucking lives.

30:45.287 --> 30:49.758
Are we gonna be surprised by that,
boys, government being government?

30:49.847 --> 30:52.884
Will we next be shocked
by rivers running...

30:52.967 --> 30:55.197
or trees casting fucking shade?

30:55.967 --> 31:00.040
Look, I have said before
and I still fucking say...

31:00.127 --> 31:03.915
those of a mind,
make a price on your claims.

31:04.087 --> 31:06.078
Get out from under uncertainty.

31:06.207 --> 31:08.880
And that's from no fucking goodness
on my part...

31:08.967 --> 31:11.083
and no fucking charity, either.

31:11.207 --> 31:13.846
I am past picking up again.

31:14.127 --> 31:18.040
This spot might be wrong,
but here's where I'm making my stand!

31:19.647 --> 31:24.163
And I'll also say,
for being a fucking Commissioner...

31:24.647 --> 31:29.198
this Jarry don't seem such a bad sort,
under the limits of what he is.

31:30.167 --> 31:31.646
Wait a minute.

31:33.167 --> 31:35.965
Does that mean
you've been fucking talking to him?

31:36.167 --> 31:37.998
When in fuck did I say I wasn't?

31:38.087 --> 31:40.043
I am asking you...

31:40.327 --> 31:42.921
where the fuck he is...

31:43.327 --> 31:46.763
and if he's at your fucking joint!

31:47.127 --> 31:49.322
And I am telling you, yes...

31:49.647 --> 31:51.877
and making no fucking apologies.

31:51.967 --> 31:54.686
And saying one more question
in that tone...

31:54.767 --> 31:56.837
will collect you a broken jaw.

32:04.047 --> 32:05.958
I don't need another fucking question...

32:06.047 --> 32:08.356
'cause I've located
the fact that I was seeking...

32:08.447 --> 32:11.405
which is the whereabouts
of the fucking Commissioner...

32:11.527 --> 32:13.677
and whoever wants can come with me!

32:19.327 --> 32:22.637
- Dangerous turn, Mr Tolliver.
- Yes.

32:23.847 --> 32:25.724
Temper loosened my tongue.

32:27.447 --> 32:28.766
You got gall...

32:30.607 --> 32:32.757
coming before me prettier than ever.

32:33.367 --> 32:34.482
Are you all right?

32:34.567 --> 32:36.398
On the fucking mend,
that's all to say on that.

32:36.487 --> 32:38.876
What do you know
of this new commissioner?

32:39.527 --> 32:41.882
His notice on the claims
has people pissed off.

32:42.047 --> 32:44.163
I wouldn't want the cocksucker harmed.

32:44.887 --> 32:47.685
- I don't intend him any.
- Don't be fucking clever with me.

32:48.047 --> 32:50.641
He's allied with Tolliver.
Are you aware of that?

32:51.607 --> 32:54.041
- No.
- Bedridden, I know more than you.

32:54.967 --> 32:58.277
The point is,
if their man's allied with Tolliver...

32:58.447 --> 33:00.005
and fucking harm comes to him...

33:00.087 --> 33:03.921
between the hoopleheads and me,
who will Yankton put it on?

33:04.447 --> 33:05.596
You.

33:06.367 --> 33:07.846
Do they understand...

33:08.127 --> 33:10.721
how most of what happens
is people being drunk...

33:10.927 --> 33:14.124
and stupid and trying to find something
else to blame besides that...

33:14.207 --> 33:16.277
that makes their lives totally fucked?

33:16.407 --> 33:17.726
- No, they don't.
- Yankton.

33:17.807 --> 33:19.559
Yankton, exactly.

33:20.087 --> 33:22.840
They're too busy stealing
to study human nature.

33:24.687 --> 33:26.120
Did you ring, Al?

33:27.687 --> 33:29.837
Now that's the sound
of that fucking bell being rung.

33:29.927 --> 33:31.519
- Did you hear that sound?
- No.

33:31.607 --> 33:33.325
No. Then get the fuck out.

33:34.647 --> 33:37.241
And both of you
being government officials...

33:39.367 --> 33:41.722
you ought to fucking look out
for each other...

33:42.847 --> 33:44.075
Sheriff.

33:53.567 --> 33:57.606
Had you vision as well as sight,
you would recognise within me...

33:57.687 --> 34:01.236
not only a man,
but an institution and the future as well.

34:01.327 --> 34:05.081
Fuck you, fuck the institution,
and fuck the future!

34:05.887 --> 34:08.525
You cannot fuck the future, sir.
The future fucks you.

34:08.607 --> 34:11.360
Come out from that cage,
you billiard-ball licking cocksucker.

34:11.447 --> 34:14.120
- I do not take orders from hooligans.
- Come out!

34:14.206 --> 34:18.324
We'll see if them cappers choose you
to look at or Tolliver's fucking money!

34:18.407 --> 34:19.476
A chancy call.

34:19.567 --> 34:22.603
Should you impede my progress, sir,
were I to attempt to leave this cage...

34:22.687 --> 34:24.484
you would seal your fate...

34:24.567 --> 34:27.478
as irrevocably
as the tyrant crossing the Rubicon!

34:27.567 --> 34:29.080
Is he asking to suck my prick?

34:29.167 --> 34:31.965
Why don't you just explain your
fucking statement, Commissioner...

34:32.047 --> 34:34.117
as far as us keeping title to our claims?

34:34.206 --> 34:36.118
I explain nothing under duress.

34:36.206 --> 34:39.005
Have you ever lived a day
in your fucking life?

34:39.567 --> 34:44.163
Pitch, Commissioner,
burning off the top of your fucking head!

34:45.967 --> 34:48.003
Is that vision or sight?

34:48.607 --> 34:52.395
Cunt or duress?

34:55.087 --> 34:57.317
What the fuck, Tolliver?

34:57.527 --> 34:59.802
The mob is an ungodly creature, Sheriff.

35:01.247 --> 35:03.317
Come on!

35:03.607 --> 35:05.040
Stand away or be shot!

35:05.127 --> 35:07.516
He's under protection of the law.

35:07.967 --> 35:10.322
You've got their fucking attention.

35:17.207 --> 35:19.801
- Fuck 'em, anyway.
- Don't get me started.

35:19.927 --> 35:22.646
Do not get me started,
Little Nigger General.

35:22.727 --> 35:26.481
If something got to go in front
of "Nigger," and don't it always...

35:26.647 --> 35:28.365
I prefer "short" to "little. "

35:28.487 --> 35:30.159
Short Nigger is a deal...

35:31.167 --> 35:33.727
and I am a girl keeps her bargain.

35:34.127 --> 35:37.244
Or I could just call you
plain Nigger General.

35:37.367 --> 35:38.925
Call me just plain Nigger.

35:39.047 --> 35:41.083
Short Plains Nigger.

35:41.167 --> 35:43.078
Nigger of the High Desert.

35:53.807 --> 35:56.526
Thanks for the conversation,
Miss Jane, and the whiskey.

35:56.927 --> 35:59.361
I am going blind as a fucking bat.

35:59.767 --> 36:03.965
Who is that, the fucking Sheriff?
Flanked by some assholes?

36:05.687 --> 36:08.201
I feel no less manhandled by you, sir.

36:09.407 --> 36:12.558
If they still had you,
by now you'd be feeling worse.

36:19.367 --> 36:21.244
I need the lockup.

36:21.927 --> 36:24.077
Wait till I take out Bill's robe.

36:41.727 --> 36:45.606
And now to jail,
as wretched indignity accumulates.

36:46.967 --> 36:50.403
A beating short of murder
might have done you considerable good.

36:52.047 --> 36:54.720
The Commissioner meets
his constituents.

36:55.167 --> 36:59.080
A man has to work some dogs
to learn how the world's tail wags.

36:59.167 --> 37:01.806
Not coming to his aid,
you mean to build his character.

37:02.007 --> 37:04.521
We all ain't sound like you, sir.

37:04.607 --> 37:07.280
Many could use
some construction work.

37:07.367 --> 37:09.198
Fellas like yourself,
that's hard to understand.

37:09.287 --> 37:11.755
Your foundation's sunk deep.

37:12.047 --> 37:14.481
Framework's first-rate,
your mason work.

37:14.567 --> 37:18.480
Nothing unfinished in you,
or rotten or damaged.

37:18.807 --> 37:20.160
Or sick.

37:28.847 --> 37:32.078
Five long years talking to nobody.

37:32.287 --> 37:36.200
Hostetler, you got enough problems
of your own.

37:36.607 --> 37:40.486
You don't need other bodies,
especially a fool!

37:40.927 --> 37:43.395
A fool! Hostetler a fool!

37:45.487 --> 37:47.603
I hope you fucking strangle under there.

37:47.687 --> 37:49.359
Mark us even on that $100.

37:49.447 --> 37:51.085
If you don't get
your fucking thumb down...

37:51.167 --> 37:52.964
I'm gonna run this pitchfork through it.

37:53.047 --> 37:57.757
We drag the nigger from the livery
to our pitch pot in Chink's Alley.

37:58.567 --> 38:02.082
And we make a good fucking racket
so that Bullock hears.

38:02.287 --> 38:05.279
He comes out, he gives fucking pursuit.

38:05.527 --> 38:08.246
Once he's across the thoroughfare...

38:08.327 --> 38:11.637
the several of us
come from under the fucking stairs...

38:11.727 --> 38:14.241
and go up and grab the Commissioner.

38:15.087 --> 38:17.362
Well, suppose Bullock
comes out shooting?

38:20.407 --> 38:22.159
Or we could just grab the nigger.

38:24.487 --> 38:29.436
Your pelvic girdle does show
the effects of your childhood illness.

38:30.447 --> 38:32.483
Your labour may be difficult.

38:33.127 --> 38:34.879
When you say difficult...

38:35.087 --> 38:38.159
I have counselled patients
on the basis of their anatomy...

38:38.247 --> 38:40.681
against taking pregnancies to term.

38:41.247 --> 38:43.636
I do not make that argument with you.

38:45.727 --> 38:48.685
Do you distinguish
between difficult and dangerous?

38:48.767 --> 38:49.836
Yes.

38:49.927 --> 38:52.805
Your shape does not add danger
to the delivery...

38:52.887 --> 38:57.517
such as to justify, for instance,
the risks of a caesarean procedure.

38:58.047 --> 39:00.436
It adds pain. Difficult in that sense?

39:00.887 --> 39:03.765
Especially since
you might be reluctant to mollify...

39:03.847 --> 39:07.123
the difficulty's effects with opiates.

39:18.167 --> 39:22.001
I've been told it wasn't an alternative
for me even to contemplate, so...

39:23.647 --> 39:25.000
this is new information.

39:25.167 --> 39:26.202
I see.

39:26.527 --> 39:30.566
And now that the choice
is within your province...

39:30.647 --> 39:33.923
do you incline
in one direction or another?

39:36.047 --> 39:39.801
To be honest, Doctor, I'm living into
the thought that I've any choice at all.

39:41.167 --> 39:43.442
You know what I'm fucking writing...

39:43.607 --> 39:45.757
fucking Nigger General.

39:46.647 --> 39:49.719
To my ingrate fucking sister Etta...

39:49.807 --> 39:51.684
who will outlast me...

39:51.887 --> 39:54.959
I am writing my fucking will.

39:55.247 --> 39:56.475
One...

40:00.167 --> 40:02.476
What else they teach you, Hostetler...

40:02.647 --> 40:05.878
at that school
where you learn how to write?

40:12.087 --> 40:13.486
What else?

40:17.047 --> 40:20.881
He's back up in the stall
up under the hay.

40:22.527 --> 40:24.245
They taught you good.

40:28.367 --> 40:29.959
Come on, you gutless cunts!

40:30.047 --> 40:31.321
Grab that nigger!

40:31.407 --> 40:32.726
Come on, Nigger.

40:34.967 --> 40:36.446
Come on, boy!

40:45.767 --> 40:47.405
They grabbed up a nigger.

40:47.487 --> 40:49.079
Where'd a fucking nigger
come into this?

40:49.167 --> 40:50.805
Hooples got him from the livery.

40:50.887 --> 40:52.957
What about Bullock
and the Commissioner?

40:53.807 --> 40:55.320
Reckon they're still upstairs.

40:55.407 --> 40:58.763
You've told me nothing.
You've added a fucking irrelevancy.

41:00.887 --> 41:04.641
It wasn't Hostetler.
It was some little nigger.

41:11.007 --> 41:15.000
I'll give you $20
if you'll let me use that as my bedroll.

41:15.487 --> 41:18.524
You got a better chance
waking up looking normal.

41:19.047 --> 41:21.686
- Hi, Charlie.
- Is the Nigger General back to camp?

41:21.807 --> 41:22.876
Yes, he is.

41:22.967 --> 41:25.959
Don't act like you know, Jane,
just 'cause you're already drunk.

41:26.047 --> 41:28.322
You are an ignorant cocksucker.

41:28.407 --> 41:30.284
He come over winter
when you was gone.

41:30.367 --> 41:33.996
- That's ignorant. I met him today.
- Why did you ask about him, Charlie?

41:34.847 --> 41:36.883
It looked like
he was gonna get done for.

41:36.967 --> 41:39.481
I mean, I couldn't see to be sure.

41:43.967 --> 41:45.559
I'm thirsty.

41:46.727 --> 41:49.366
Lie on your back, take aim and piss.

41:51.247 --> 41:52.885
How did I wrong you,
choice gentlemen?

41:52.967 --> 41:54.923
You want to start
with me getting draughted...

41:55.007 --> 41:57.521
so my cousin
got the fucking confectionery?

41:59.887 --> 42:02.355
And that's why
you're going to vulcanise me?

42:02.447 --> 42:03.800
Shut your fucking mouth!

42:03.887 --> 42:07.766
Your cousin, trapped East, allows you
to come here to strike it rich.

42:07.847 --> 42:10.122
- Ain't that so, sir?
- Get him the fuck up!

42:12.047 --> 42:13.924
Get him the fuck up!

42:17.967 --> 42:22.165
You stole my look at riches,
you and your fucking monkey cousins!

42:24.287 --> 42:25.925
You motherfucker!

42:26.767 --> 42:29.520
- Disperse this riotous assembly!
- Let go of the Nigger General.

42:29.607 --> 42:31.120
That monkey just motherfucked me!

42:31.207 --> 42:34.836
I'll motherfuck you
and blow your head off.

42:56.007 --> 42:57.235
Cunt!

42:58.127 --> 43:00.880
May I please go over
those columns with you?

43:01.327 --> 43:04.364
What is the fucking point
of you going over the columns?

43:04.607 --> 43:06.723
You know the method
of this shit already...

43:06.887 --> 43:09.401
took in probably
at your mother's fucking tit!

43:09.927 --> 43:13.442
God help me for enjoying you out there,
even only to abuse me.

43:15.607 --> 43:18.121
Although I also wouldn't mind
getting fucked.

43:20.207 --> 43:23.916
A last try at twinning these columns,
then you'll have your fucking wish.

43:24.447 --> 43:28.804
The correct answer in each instance
is $127.49.

43:30.007 --> 43:31.520
You fuck.

43:55.087 --> 43:56.839
Good evening, Trixie.

43:58.127 --> 44:02.325
I was coming to you once I'd done
these columns and fucked a friend.

44:08.087 --> 44:10.123
Anyone else look in on you today?

44:11.207 --> 44:13.767
I did have another visitor, yes.

44:14.887 --> 44:17.196
I'm gonna light a fucking cigarette
in here.

44:17.607 --> 44:21.122
- Fuck anyone who doesn't like it!
- Please, do smoke.

44:21.807 --> 44:23.399
Thank you so much.

44:27.767 --> 44:30.235
So how'd the other visitor's visit go?

44:31.647 --> 44:33.000
I am as we thought.

44:34.327 --> 44:35.396
And?

44:38.087 --> 44:43.002
And he expects an uneventful course,
though not without difficulties.

44:43.487 --> 44:47.002
- I love how they fucking put it.
- Well, that's my formulation.

44:53.447 --> 44:55.403
Does formulation mean "plan"?

44:57.447 --> 44:58.596
My plan...

45:00.327 --> 45:02.636
at the moment, is to watch...

45:03.807 --> 45:05.160
and wait.

45:11.567 --> 45:13.842
I couldn't help noticing, Trixie...

45:14.727 --> 45:17.241
you're occupied now
at the hardware store.

45:19.407 --> 45:20.886
Yes, Alma, I am.

45:21.527 --> 45:25.122
I'm spending time at Bullock and Star's
learning to do accounts.

45:26.407 --> 45:28.204
I'm so delighted.

45:28.287 --> 45:30.801
Though I'm also fucking
one of the owners.

45:30.887 --> 45:31.876
Well...

45:32.647 --> 45:34.797
I'm delighted by that as well.

45:38.527 --> 45:40.643
Trixie, can I have a puff
of your cigarette?

45:41.767 --> 45:44.884
- You ever smoked before?
- No.

45:55.567 --> 45:56.682
Thank you.

45:59.327 --> 46:00.362
Sure.

46:06.007 --> 46:07.122
Good night.

46:12.047 --> 46:13.480
Congratulations.

46:27.687 --> 46:31.362
- Hello, there.
- $127.49...

46:31.607 --> 46:34.167
both columns separate, verified.

46:34.647 --> 46:38.003
Lying with aplomb.
You've got the true calling.

46:39.087 --> 46:42.124
What you heard otherwise
is none of your business.

46:42.247 --> 46:44.078
I didn't hear anything else.

46:54.247 --> 46:56.317
Let me work on your column now.

47:00.927 --> 47:03.282
"My own darling wife Agnes...

47:04.767 --> 47:07.600
"I have but a few moments left
before this letter starts.

47:08.367 --> 47:10.164
"I never was as well in my life.

47:10.487 --> 47:13.877
"But you'd laugh to see me now,
as I just got in from prospecting. "

47:14.447 --> 47:15.516
He's lying.

47:15.607 --> 47:18.599
I'm told he never prospected
a moment of his time in the camp.

47:18.687 --> 47:20.917
We must report him
so he'll be punished.

47:21.807 --> 47:24.446
"I am almost sure I will do well here.

47:25.007 --> 47:28.204
"We will have a home yet.
Then we will be so happy. "

47:29.767 --> 47:33.726
He spells like a child.
Sure is spelled S-H-U-R-E.

47:34.927 --> 47:38.556
- Is it a very long letter?
- No, as you're about to discover.

47:39.527 --> 47:41.438
"Here the man is hurrying me.

47:41.527 --> 47:44.280
"I have but a few moments left
before the mail must start.

47:44.887 --> 47:46.559
"Goodbye, my dear wife. "

47:46.887 --> 47:49.799
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye.

47:49.887 --> 47:52.447
"J.B. Hickok, Wild Bill. "

47:53.247 --> 47:54.680
Goodbye, Wild Bill.

47:56.687 --> 48:00.839
- There's a postscript.
- Is it a very long postscript?

48:02.807 --> 48:04.365
"Agnes, darling...

48:06.047 --> 48:08.800
"if such should be
we never meet again...

48:09.407 --> 48:11.284
"while firing my last shot...

48:11.487 --> 48:15.036
"I will gently breathe
the name of my wife, Agnes...

48:15.927 --> 48:17.883
"and with wishes even for my enemies...

48:18.687 --> 48:21.918
"I will make the plunge
and try to swim to the other shore. "

48:33.127 --> 48:36.119
Are you a man who needs
his trousers rubbed?

48:37.287 --> 48:38.879
I am a man...

48:41.247 --> 48:43.124
who needs his trousers taken off.

48:46.447 --> 48:47.721
I can do that.

48:55.247 --> 48:59.604
Seems to me there's reabsorption
of the haemorrhage.

49:00.967 --> 49:03.037
What the fuck good
is less blood in my eye?

49:03.127 --> 49:05.038
I want use of my fucking limbs.

49:05.127 --> 49:06.196
I understand.

49:06.287 --> 49:08.596
I have spent my last day abed hearing...

49:09.087 --> 49:11.396
second-hand news from imbeciles.

49:11.927 --> 49:15.840
Strike you as overweening, Al,
setting nature to a schedule?

49:15.927 --> 49:18.441
I'm not setting terms for nature.
I'm setting them for myself.

49:18.527 --> 49:22.805
Who has dominion over nature?
Al Swearengen, owner and proprietor.

49:22.927 --> 49:26.158
As to when he takes his leave,
you're A-one fucking right.

49:32.967 --> 49:34.764
Well, I don't understand.

49:39.007 --> 49:40.122
Bullock?

49:40.407 --> 49:42.796
Why the fuck do you whisper? Bullock!

49:43.087 --> 49:45.476
I could have said you was asleep.

49:47.207 --> 49:49.198
- Doc.
- Sheriff.

49:53.887 --> 49:55.798
Pithy and civil.

50:04.687 --> 50:06.678
The Commissioner's all right.

50:14.247 --> 50:18.445
You wipe the rim of that bottle, I'll
knock you out from my present vantage.

50:23.407 --> 50:25.159
They're coming against us.

50:27.207 --> 50:29.163
Post a notice like that...

50:29.567 --> 50:33.196
not award even one commissioner
of the three to local citizenry.

50:33.287 --> 50:35.243
I'll guarantee you this, too.

50:36.607 --> 50:41.123
Politicians ain't got balls
for this type of unsupported move.

50:43.247 --> 50:44.919
Someone's backing their play.

50:45.287 --> 50:47.926
Or they'd be here bending over for us.

50:48.687 --> 50:50.837
- Is it Tolliver?
- Tolliver is us.

50:50.927 --> 50:55.000
They ain't gonna pick Tolliver over me
this early in the game.

50:56.127 --> 50:57.242
I see.

50:58.207 --> 51:00.926
There's a nigger
in the fucking woodpile somewhere...

51:01.167 --> 51:03.727
someone from outside the camp.

51:06.127 --> 51:07.116
Anyways.

51:07.207 --> 51:09.675
That nigger the hooples grabbed,
did they kill him?

51:09.767 --> 51:12.520
- Tarred his shoulder.
- What stopped them at that?

51:14.767 --> 51:15.802
Me.

51:16.327 --> 51:18.795
I get back on my fucking feet...

51:19.367 --> 51:21.323
I'll carry my share of the water.

51:24.167 --> 51:25.646
My money's on you.

51:27.087 --> 51:29.078
Here comes some pain for you.

51:32.887 --> 51:36.926
You ever think of screaming instead of
biting through your own fucking flesh?

51:38.967 --> 51:40.685
It's my fucking pain.

51:41.927 --> 51:45.920
And I am suggesting
an improved way of dealing with it...

51:46.407 --> 51:48.875
which is how progress occurs.

51:48.967 --> 51:50.685
Will you two be quiet?

51:52.447 --> 51:56.599
Not only will we not be quiet,
you frog-faced fuck...

51:58.447 --> 52:00.642
I'm gonna take this stick...

52:00.967 --> 52:03.606
and drag it back and forth
across the bars of your cell.

52:03.687 --> 52:06.679
I am not a prisoner!
I am in protective custody!

52:06.767 --> 52:09.884
In care of a deputy
deputised by the Deputy Sheriff...

52:09.967 --> 52:12.117
who orders you to shut the fuck up!

52:24.887 --> 52:28.357
- You know Hostetler?
- He runs the livery?

52:30.047 --> 52:32.561
- Taller than me.
- I know him.

52:34.767 --> 52:38.476
I'd be glad if he heard
I'd have done just what he did...

52:39.647 --> 52:40.921
only quicker.

52:41.887 --> 52:44.242
I guess he'll understand that, if I don't.

52:45.167 --> 52:48.523
He'll understand.
I'd tell him myself except...

52:49.967 --> 52:51.798
I'm keeping indoors tonight.

52:53.767 --> 52:55.678
Here comes some more pain.

52:56.305 --> 53:02.511
