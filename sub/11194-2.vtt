00:16.480 --> 00:19.240
(Stargate alarm)

00:28.520 --> 00:29.840
- George.
- Jacob.

00:30.000 --> 00:32.720
Colonel O'Neill... Teal'c... Daniel.

00:32.880 --> 00:34.040
Sam.

00:37.840 --> 00:39.880
- How are you doing, kid?
- OK, Dad.

00:41.080 --> 00:44.680
So, you guys are the talk
of the Tok'ra water cooler.

00:44.840 --> 00:47.280
- For what?
- Kicking some major Hathor behind.

00:47.440 --> 00:51.840
Yes, we do take pride in good work.
But that's not why you're here?

00:52.160 --> 00:54.280
No. We need your help.

00:54.440 --> 00:56.400
You need our help? With what?

00:57.040 --> 00:59.640
Let's just call it a Goa'uld hunt.

01:07.280 --> 01:09.360
(high-pitched whirring)

01:09.520 --> 01:10.720
(beeps)

01:17.360 --> 01:20.880
- (Daniel) It's fascinating.
- (Sam) No kidding!

01:22.760 --> 01:27.040
A projected hologram with no
silver-halide-coated plates, no...

01:27.200 --> 01:29.600
I was talking about
what's being projected.

01:29.760 --> 01:32.920
It's like a... family tree
of the ancient Egyptian gods.

01:33.360 --> 01:36.080
Actually, of the Goa'uld System Lords.

01:36.840 --> 01:40.560
(Daniel) Ra, Apophis, Hathor, Heru-Ur...

01:40.720 --> 01:43.760
The symbol of Setesh is oscillating.

01:45.480 --> 01:48.280
That is the symbol for Setesh.

01:48.440 --> 01:51.760
- Have you met him, too?
- I have met descendants of his Jaffa.

01:51.920 --> 01:55.520
All right. Who's this Setesh fella?

01:55.960 --> 02:00.600
Otherwise known as Setekh...
Set, Seti, Seth.

02:01.560 --> 02:05.720
Ancient Egyptian god of chaos.
Embodies hostility and... outright evil.

02:05.880 --> 02:08.080
Why haven't we heard of him before?

02:08.240 --> 02:12.880
We haven't met all the System Lords.
There's probably thousands more, right?

02:13.040 --> 02:16.560
Only dozens of System Lords.
Thousands of Goa'ulds in general.

02:16.920 --> 02:22.600
- What makes you think we met this one?
- The Tok'ra have taken a Goa'uld census.

02:22.760 --> 02:26.560
Where the System Lords are positioned,
what domain they rule,...

02:26.720 --> 02:29.160
..who serves under them,
that sort of thing.

02:29.320 --> 02:32.560
But there's one Goa'uld
we've lost track of.

02:32.720 --> 02:34.440
Seth?

02:34.600 --> 02:38.560
A record of him ends when the Earth's
gate was buried in ancient Egypt.

02:40.440 --> 02:42.280
Are you saying he never left?

02:42.840 --> 02:47.760
That's our theory. We think he still might
be here, hiding among Earth's people.

03:55.200 --> 03:57.320
We'll be cuttin' to the chase on this one.

03:57.480 --> 04:00.800
You want us to find this snake-head
who, if he's here,...

04:00.960 --> 04:04.400
..would be hiding
in one of six billion people on Earth?

04:04.880 --> 04:06.440
Yes.

04:06.760 --> 04:09.560
- How do you know he's alive?
- If he has a sarcophagus.

04:09.720 --> 04:12.400
Or if he changes hosts
every 400 years or so.

04:12.560 --> 04:15.400
But why wouldn't he have tried
to get at the Stargate...

04:15.560 --> 04:17.480
..between when it was buried and now?

04:17.640 --> 04:20.320
Or why wouldn't he try
to take over the Earth like Ra?

04:20.480 --> 04:23.440
Seth had a price on his head -
he tried to overthrow Ra.

04:23.760 --> 04:27.040
Now the System Lords wanted him dead,
as did the Tok'ra.

04:27.200 --> 04:31.520
We believe if he's still here
it's because he's using Earth as a hideout.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.320
He wishes to hide among you.

04:33.480 --> 04:37.000
Kinda gives "needle in a haystack"
a whole new meaning.

04:37.160 --> 04:39.040
Well... I know it's a long shot.

04:39.480 --> 04:43.840
Not necessarily.
Remember, Setesh is a Goa'uld.

04:44.000 --> 04:46.960
- Yeah.
- As a Goa'uld he thirsts for power.

04:47.120 --> 04:49.400
They have a common MO
for getting that power.

04:49.560 --> 04:50.840
False religion.

04:51.000 --> 04:54.800
Which shrinks the proverbial haystack
considerably.

04:54.960 --> 04:59.440
Let me see if I can track him through
archaeological and historical record.

04:59.600 --> 05:00.760
Do it.

05:03.520 --> 05:07.680
Dad, you don't really think we have
a chance of finding this Goa'uld, do you?

05:07.840 --> 05:11.280
- It's the mission Garshaw assigned me.
- You didn't request it?

05:12.320 --> 05:15.520
- Dad?
- (laughs) Why would I request it?

05:15.680 --> 05:19.200
C'mon! Would it be so awful
to admit that you just wanted to see me?

05:19.360 --> 05:21.000
Of course not - you're right.

05:21.160 --> 05:23.840
That's why I requested it.

05:24.600 --> 05:27.600
OK, so that's obviously not the reason.

05:27.760 --> 05:29.280
What's going on?

05:37.080 --> 05:39.160
(distorted) I requested the assignment.

05:39.320 --> 05:42.320
- Selmak!
- Nice to see you again, Captain Carter.

05:42.680 --> 05:45.720
Likewise.
So, let me ask you the same question.

05:46.360 --> 05:50.760
Your father has an unresolved issue
on your planet, and it irritates me.

05:50.920 --> 05:52.240
Mark.

05:52.400 --> 05:55.120
Yes. Your father's a proud man.

05:55.280 --> 05:58.800
He refuses to seek out your brother
and mend the relationship.

05:58.960 --> 06:03.200
Yeah. Well, Mark hasn't exactly
rushed into my father's arms either.

06:03.360 --> 06:05.560
Even when we thought
Dad was gonna die.

06:05.920 --> 06:11.200
It hurt your father deeply when his son
didn't come to him on his deathbed.

06:12.680 --> 06:14.040
(undistorted) Why "hurt"?

06:14.200 --> 06:19.160
As far as I was concerned the kid wasn't
my son any more. It didn't hurt a bit.

06:19.920 --> 06:21.320
Dad...

06:21.480 --> 06:23.600
I have a number for Mark in San Diego.

06:23.760 --> 06:25.160
So?

06:25.320 --> 06:27.240
I just thought you might wanna know.

06:27.400 --> 06:31.120
- When was the last time you saw him?
- Not since his kids were born.

06:31.280 --> 06:33.680
He paints me with the same brush
as he does you.

06:33.840 --> 06:36.640
Well, Selmak's pushing me
to go mend some fences.

06:36.800 --> 06:40.080
I guess Selmak is as wise as they say.
I'll go with you. When?

06:40.240 --> 06:42.720
I didn't say I'd go.
I just said Selmak's pushing it.

06:44.320 --> 06:46.160
So, what's the bad news?

06:46.320 --> 06:49.440
- On the contrary, we have good news.
- (Sam) You do?

06:50.200 --> 06:54.960
I did a time-line Boolean search for
religion, cult, Set, Setesh, Setekh, Seth...

06:55.120 --> 06:56.720
Yadda...

06:58.760 --> 06:59.840
Here's what I found.

07:00.000 --> 07:04.480
There's been a cult of Setesh in one form
or another since around 1000 BC.

07:05.200 --> 07:08.400
- What is that?
- Oh, yeah, that. Well...

07:09.080 --> 07:12.760
Setesh was represented by an animal,
either fictitious or now extinct,...

07:12.920 --> 07:14.640
..most likely the former,...

07:14.800 --> 07:19.000
since anthropologists haven't found
any fossils to point to a species like this.

07:19.160 --> 07:23.800
Because the creature represents Setesh,
the helmets of the Setesh guard...

07:23.960 --> 07:26.920
..are the source of many jokes
among the Jaffa.

07:28.520 --> 07:30.560
Jaffa jokes?

07:30.720 --> 07:33.040
Let's hear one of them!

07:33.200 --> 07:36.120
I shall attempt to translate one, O'Neill.

07:36.280 --> 07:40.720
A serpent guard, a Horus guard and
a Setesh guard meet on a neutral planet.

07:40.880 --> 07:43.720
It is a tense moment.
The serpent guard's eyes glow.

07:45.160 --> 07:48.600
The Horus guard's beak glistens.

07:48.760 --> 07:53.240
The Setesh guard's nose drips.

08:01.760 --> 08:06.560
OK! After Set was supposedly killed
in ancient Egypt with all his minions,...

08:06.720 --> 08:10.000
..a similar god showed up in Greece
called Typhon.

08:10.160 --> 08:13.520
Similar back-stories.
Another fictitious animal representation.

08:13.840 --> 08:18.120
In a legend he killed 300 followers
and then disappeared from Greece.

08:18.280 --> 08:22.400
At that point he seemed to have vanished
from history, until I found this.

08:22.560 --> 08:25.520
A new cult arose in England
in the early 1800s,...

08:25.680 --> 08:28.440
..strangely enough
near the location of Stonehenge.

08:28.600 --> 08:34.520
The cult had an enigmatic leader named
Seth. And this is the important part.

08:34.679 --> 08:38.679
Seth's worshippers were found dead,
having slit their own throats.

08:39.360 --> 08:41.039
But Seth's body was never found.

08:41.640 --> 08:45.480
- Liked to leave a lot of dead bodies.
- Did you lose the scent there?

08:45.640 --> 08:48.640
I thought so, until I searched
the US government classified net...

08:48.800 --> 08:52.280
..in case the CIA had a record of...
something, somewhere.

08:52.440 --> 08:54.800
And guess what came up
on the ATF page.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.040
"A cult whose leader is named Seth."

08:58.200 --> 09:00.440
Just north of Seattle.

09:01.360 --> 09:05.040
The ATF are investigating him now
because they're so heavily armed.

09:05.200 --> 09:08.200
This guy has about 50 followers
ready to die for him.

09:08.360 --> 09:11.640
You mean to say
you actually found this guy?

09:11.920 --> 09:13.920
How do we know he's our Goa'uld?

09:16.600 --> 09:21.240
Deprogrammed ex-members of the cult
describe Seth as having magical powers.

09:21.400 --> 09:24.480
They claim he's murdered
members in front of the others.

09:24.640 --> 09:25.880
Here's the best part.

09:26.040 --> 09:31.200
"Several independent reports state the
cult leader can make his own eyes glow."

10:23.280 --> 10:28.160
That's the place. Main building's about
three quarters of a mile up that drive.

10:28.320 --> 10:30.320
I hope you can shut these guys down.

10:30.480 --> 10:34.480
I had a lot of parents come in my office -
they lost their kids to this nut.

10:34.640 --> 10:39.400
I haven't got the manpower or the, uh...
probable cause that you federal types do.

10:40.160 --> 10:44.480
Well, we'll do what we can, Sheriff.
Appreciate you lettin' us look around.

10:44.640 --> 10:48.200
(two-way radio) Sheriff.
We got a fight breaking out at Earl's.

10:48.360 --> 10:50.280
Duty calls.

10:50.440 --> 10:54.680
Now, uh... you don't need me gettin'
in your way. Gimme a call if you need me.

10:54.840 --> 10:56.960
(O'Neill) Will do.

11:10.480 --> 11:13.040
You people the FBl?

11:13.200 --> 11:15.040
No. Who are you?

11:16.600 --> 11:19.640
Jason Levinson.
I've been camping here the past month,...

11:19.800 --> 11:22.600
..hoping to catch a glimpse of my boy,
Tommy.

11:22.760 --> 11:24.480
At least know he's still alive.

11:24.640 --> 11:27.400
He's been in there nine months now.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.880
You folks deprogrammers?

11:30.040 --> 11:34.360
You gotta be good. The guy I hired
got shot in the leg trying to get in there.

11:34.520 --> 11:36.640
So they've got some armed guards?

11:37.160 --> 11:38.360
A lot of them.

11:38.520 --> 11:43.280
What's that damn small-town sheriff
do about it? Nothing. Not a damn thing.

11:49.400 --> 11:52.520
You're the father, aren't you?
Your boy's in there.

11:52.680 --> 11:54.480
No, no. You've got that wrong.

11:54.640 --> 11:56.120
My son isn't in there.

11:58.400 --> 12:00.320
Uh-huh.

12:01.680 --> 12:05.680
How much would you tack on to
get my boy out the same time as his?

12:05.840 --> 12:07.960
You help us,
we might be able to help you.

12:08.240 --> 12:09.160
I'm with you, sir.

12:09.320 --> 12:12.640
That won't be necessary,
but any information you might have...

12:12.920 --> 12:15.600
What your guy did, where he got caught...

12:15.760 --> 12:17.920
You got it.

12:18.080 --> 12:21.280
The fence is in the wide open,
and most of the property.

12:21.440 --> 12:25.360
But I'll show you a brush cover,
if you wanna go in.

12:26.800 --> 12:30.600
O'Neill. We are being surveilled.

12:30.760 --> 12:36.320
Yeah, I saw 'em.
It's probably FBl. Maybe ATF.

12:51.280 --> 12:55.080
You guys are prepared. I'm goin' with you.

12:55.240 --> 12:58.440
I think it'd be safer for everyone
if you wait for us here.

13:51.960 --> 13:53.480
AK-47s,...

13:54.760 --> 13:56.600
..a couple of Uzis...

13:56.760 --> 14:00.880
Anyone think they observed the 1 5-day
waiting period for those weapons?

14:01.040 --> 14:06.320
Sir, their side arms. I think it's safe
to say there's a Goa'uld there.

14:06.480 --> 14:09.520
And... it looks like a pair of .50-cals.

14:09.680 --> 14:13.120
Does the concept of overkill
mean anything to anybody?

14:14.800 --> 14:16.720
Let's fall back to the RV point.

14:31.520 --> 14:32.960
Lower your weapons!

14:34.720 --> 14:37.520
I was wondering when you folks
were gonna show.

14:37.680 --> 14:40.480
We got bets - I say FBl, they say ATF.

14:40.640 --> 14:42.960
Special Agent James Hamner, ATF.

14:43.120 --> 14:44.640
Damn!

15:02.640 --> 15:06.600
General. Wanna tell me
what interest the Air Force has here?

15:06.760 --> 15:09.000
That would be classified.

15:10.360 --> 15:13.720
This way, gentlemen.
Are you guys Special Forces?

15:13.880 --> 15:15.760
(O'Neill) Also classified.

15:15.920 --> 15:18.240
I was talking to your commanding officer.

15:18.400 --> 15:20.520
He's right. It's classified.

15:20.680 --> 15:22.600
I have top-level clearance.

15:22.760 --> 15:24.680
Oh, not top enough.

15:26.600 --> 15:29.520
You have a rather insubordinate
subordinate, General.

15:29.680 --> 15:34.320
Not to me. Only to people such as
yourself. Saves me the trouble.

15:34.480 --> 15:38.080
Now maybe you could tell us
what you and your cohorts are planning.

15:38.240 --> 15:43.520
This compound is owned by a cult run
by a guy by the name of Seth Fargough.

15:43.680 --> 15:47.600
Recent intelligence confirms they have
a hoard of prohibited weaponry.

15:48.080 --> 15:51.320
That's some mighty fine intelligence
you got there.

15:51.480 --> 15:52.960
(Jacob) What do you plan to do?

15:53.120 --> 15:56.200
Negotiate,
try to get 'em to come out peacefully.

15:56.360 --> 15:58.520
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

15:58.680 --> 16:00.040
And I suppose you do(?)

16:00.200 --> 16:03.480
- As a matter of fact...
- Great! Then why don't you tell me?

16:03.720 --> 16:06.400
Uh, that would be... classified, as well.

16:06.560 --> 16:08.600
Fine! Well, I'll tell you what.

16:10.440 --> 16:13.720
The United States Air Force
has not been invited to participate.

16:13.880 --> 16:17.680
You're out of your jurisdiction.
Leave, or I'll have you arrested.

16:17.840 --> 16:22.800
This is a secure phone, isn't it?
Can we use it to place one call?

16:22.960 --> 16:24.600
Why not?

16:24.920 --> 16:26.840
Thank you. Colonel?

16:38.440 --> 16:40.360
Jack, based on Seth's history,...

16:40.520 --> 16:44.720
..if these guys go in there guns blazing,
he's gonna kill everyone in there.

16:44.880 --> 16:48.240
Jacob, can we assume
brainwashing is going on in there?

16:48.840 --> 16:53.160
It's probably Nish'ta. It's a biological
compound that, once inhaled,...

16:53.320 --> 16:56.120
..infects all body tissue,
including your brain.

16:56.360 --> 16:58.920
It tends to make your mind
extremely pliable.

16:59.240 --> 17:03.640
- That's like what Hathor used.
- It's stronger. It's more encompassing.

17:03.800 --> 17:06.880
I believe that is the substance
Apophis used on Rya'c.

17:07.040 --> 17:10.680
- Can it be reversed?
- Nish'ta does have an Achilles heel.

17:10.839 --> 17:15.079
Once its effects are reversed, it can't
re-infect the host. They become immune.

17:15.240 --> 17:17.240
OK, well, how do we reverse it?

17:17.400 --> 17:19.720
There's only one way:
an electrical shock.

17:19.880 --> 17:23.839
Strong enough to kill the organism,
but weak enough not to kill the host.

17:24.200 --> 17:27.440
That is why it worked
when I shot Rya'c with a zat'n'ktel.

17:27.599 --> 17:30.440
Then... we go in with zats.

17:31.440 --> 17:35.040
Well, it's not going to be
very covert that way.

17:35.200 --> 17:39.120
And, like I said, any kind of frontal attack
is gonna be a problem.

17:39.280 --> 17:40.840
Daniel's right, sir.

17:41.000 --> 17:45.840
With all the fire power he's got, we
wouldn't stand much of a chance anyway.

17:47.200 --> 17:48.320
(rings)

17:52.480 --> 17:54.240
Hamner.

17:55.400 --> 17:58.080
Yes, Mr President.

17:58.240 --> 18:01.240
Yes, sir, I am the SRO.

18:01.400 --> 18:03.960
Yes, sir, they are here, sir, but...

18:05.640 --> 18:10.600
With respect, sir, the jurisdictional rules
are clear. This is a civilian matter.

18:12.680 --> 18:14.760
Are you sure you wanna do that, sir?

18:17.400 --> 18:18.960
Yes, Mr President.

18:22.400 --> 18:24.320
Get Colonel O'Neill in here.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.120
Something I can do for you?

18:37.920 --> 18:41.400
- What's going on?
- Didn't you say you know more than I do?

18:41.560 --> 18:45.400
Well, apparently not.
I just got off the phone with the President.

18:45.560 --> 18:48.520
Of the United States of America?

18:49.600 --> 18:51.560
Sweet. How's he doin'?

18:52.240 --> 18:56.480
- He seems to have a thing for you.
- Yeah, well... you know.

18:59.120 --> 19:03.040
In fact, I'm to issue you an emergency
"special agent" credential.

19:03.200 --> 19:05.400
He's put you in charge of this operation.

19:05.560 --> 19:06.880
Excellent!

19:07.040 --> 19:10.880
My first order of business:
Get me one of those cool jackets!

19:11.040 --> 19:13.280
Extra large. Double-XL, if you got it.

19:13.680 --> 19:16.840
Wanna tell me why the Air Force
cares so much about this cult?

19:17.000 --> 19:20.640
Wanna do me a favour?
On your way out, send my team in.

19:23.160 --> 19:24.920
Your team.

19:25.080 --> 19:29.040
It's an odd bunch of people, Colonel.
Civilian scientists.

19:31.160 --> 19:35.640
This Seth guy got some secret weapon
you don't want the world to know about?

19:38.200 --> 19:40.480
All right, listen.

19:40.640 --> 19:44.760
Since you have clearance,
I'll throw you a bone.

19:44.920 --> 19:48.120
Seth and his boys got
some top-secret technology...

19:48.280 --> 19:52.600
..that we would prefer not fall into
the public consciousness just yet.

19:52.760 --> 19:55.400
- Comprehend?
- Yeah.

19:55.560 --> 19:57.520
Good.

19:57.680 --> 20:01.960
- Now, you've heard of classified.
- You got it.

20:02.120 --> 20:03.920
Thank you.

20:17.200 --> 20:19.680
Did General Hammond
involve the President, sir?

20:19.840 --> 20:24.960
Oh yeah! He's put me in charge here
for the time being.

20:25.120 --> 20:27.080
What do you suggest, O'Neill?

20:27.240 --> 20:31.040
Well, I'm thinkin' we need to get in there.

20:31.920 --> 20:34.480
- OK, how?
- The floor is open.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.520
I was thinking about that.
If Seth's MO hasn't changed,...

20:38.680 --> 20:41.800
..we know certain things
from digs in Giza.

20:41.960 --> 20:43.360
We do?

20:43.520 --> 20:47.200
Leaders built their compounds
with underground escape tunnels.

20:47.360 --> 20:50.240
Correct.
Apophis had them built into his facilities.

20:50.680 --> 20:54.800
OK, so we should do a perimeter search
and look for those tunnel entrances.

20:54.960 --> 20:56.880
That's a lot of territory.

21:00.640 --> 21:02.720
We'll have Mr Hamner's men help us.

21:49.640 --> 21:51.560
O'Neill!

22:05.960 --> 22:07.720
OK.

22:08.760 --> 22:10.840
We've got a point of entry. Now what?

22:11.000 --> 22:14.480
As soon as we get near anyone
on the inside, we could get shot.

22:14.640 --> 22:19.160
Or worse, dosed with that organism,
and suddenly we're working for Seth.

22:19.320 --> 22:21.000
It won't work on me or Teal'c.

22:21.160 --> 22:24.760
But he'll sense you're Goa'ulds
as soon as you're within 50 feet.

22:24.920 --> 22:28.280
With the arsenal he's got
we wouldn't even get close to him.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.200
Which is why you're not going in.

22:32.160 --> 22:35.760
Dad, you said an electrical shock,
like a zat gun, would snap us out of it.

22:36.400 --> 22:38.320
Yeah.

22:38.480 --> 22:39.960
Sir, I think I have an idea.

22:47.560 --> 22:49.560
Gimme a test count.

22:49.720 --> 22:54.880
One Mississippi, two Mississippi,
three Mississippi, four Mississippi, five...

22:57.720 --> 22:59.360
Carter?

22:59.520 --> 23:02.840
It'll work, sir, assuming Dad's right.

23:03.000 --> 23:03.920
Dad?

23:04.680 --> 23:06.440
If the jolt is big enough.

23:06.600 --> 23:10.040
But you'll have to let the Nish'ta
spread through all your tissues...

23:10.200 --> 23:11.880
..or it'll regain a stronghold.

23:12.280 --> 23:13.840
Gimme a ten-count.

23:14.000 --> 23:16.720
- Uh... one, two, three, four...
- That's good.

23:16.880 --> 23:19.680
- You ready for yours, Captain?
- One second.

23:23.040 --> 23:24.960
OK, Teal'c, push the button.

23:29.000 --> 23:30.880
- Aagh!
- Hey!

23:31.040 --> 23:33.960
- OK?
- OK.

23:34.600 --> 23:36.520
Wire me.

24:10.680 --> 24:13.400
Daniel, you're certain
that if we get caught...

24:13.560 --> 24:16.160
..he'll turn us into zombies
rather than kill us?

24:16.320 --> 24:19.160
Well,
we're more valuable to him that way.

24:19.320 --> 24:21.360
Why? How do you think he'll use us?

24:21.520 --> 24:23.680
Historically, he used women as a harem.

24:23.840 --> 24:27.760
They catered to his every whim and
as a result they were well cared for.

24:27.920 --> 24:30.320
- Super(!)
- And the men outside the main court...

24:30.480 --> 24:33.920
..were used as warriors and guards,
doing his bidding.

24:34.080 --> 24:38.280
Dare I ask about the men inside
the compound?

24:38.440 --> 24:40.360
They were turned into eunuchs.

24:42.120 --> 24:44.280
Eunuchs as in "snippety-doo-dah"?

24:46.240 --> 24:48.160
Sweet.

24:55.880 --> 24:57.400
(clang)

25:17.480 --> 25:19.520
- (O'Neill) Daniel?
- What?

25:20.600 --> 25:22.120
Now what?

25:23.400 --> 25:25.480
Why are you asking me?

25:25.640 --> 25:28.200
Well, y...you knew there'd be tunnels, so...

25:30.080 --> 25:34.240
Well, in the digs there were stairs
leading up to the main structure.

25:48.120 --> 25:49.800
I hate it when that happens.

25:56.880 --> 25:58.200
Hey!

25:59.360 --> 26:01.920
(distorted) Welcome!

26:04.600 --> 26:06.000
Who are you?

26:06.160 --> 26:10.640
Well, I'm Larry, this is Moe and,
of course, everyone's favourite, Curly.

26:15.000 --> 26:19.200
Say goodbye to your impure military past.

26:19.360 --> 26:22.280
We're always happy
to welcome new disciples...

26:22.440 --> 26:25.000
..to the bliss that only Seth can bestow.

26:33.960 --> 26:35.480
(O'Neill coughs)

26:36.160 --> 26:41.800
So help me, if I wake up
and I'm singing soprano...

27:00.560 --> 27:03.120
(woman) Welcome, disciple.

27:03.440 --> 27:05.920
How are you feeling?

27:06.080 --> 27:08.360
- OK. Pretty good.
- Good.

27:08.520 --> 27:11.320
Do you feel strong enough
to serve your god, Seth?

27:11.480 --> 27:13.080
Yes, of course.

27:13.240 --> 27:15.160
This way.

27:21.680 --> 27:22.800
They are awake.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.360
- Shall I activate the devices?
- (distorted) No.

27:25.520 --> 27:29.560
We must wait to be sure
the Nish'ta has permeated their tissues.

27:29.720 --> 27:32.000
- How long?
- About an hour.

27:32.160 --> 27:36.200
It's a smart virus. If there's any
unaffected tissue in the body...

27:36.360 --> 27:39.880
..it will give the organism
a safe harbour in which to mutate.

27:40.040 --> 27:44.480
- Then it will overtake your body again.
- Excuse me. Mind if I watch?

27:47.800 --> 27:50.600
I mean, my son's in there.
I just wanna be involved.

27:50.760 --> 27:53.320
I'm afraid I can't let you in here, sir.
I'm sorry.

27:53.480 --> 27:56.560
Yeah. Figured.

27:56.720 --> 27:59.040
- Grab a cup of coffee?
- Sure. Go ahead.

28:05.400 --> 28:07.240
Ow!

28:08.000 --> 28:09.480
Sorry.

28:09.640 --> 28:12.240
Sorry. It won't happen again.

28:12.920 --> 28:17.520
I've just been kinda short-fused...
since I found out about Tommy.

28:18.960 --> 28:20.280
I understand.

28:22.600 --> 28:25.840
I had to find out
from his college roommate cos, uh...

28:26.000 --> 28:28.960
..Tommy and me
hadn't been talking for six months.

28:29.120 --> 28:33.680
I do not understand. How could a father
not speak to his son for so long?

28:34.880 --> 28:39.840
Yeah, that's the funny thing about it:
I don't even remember why.

28:40.000 --> 28:44.520
Obviously something pretty stupid
in the scheme of things.

28:44.680 --> 28:46.600
I'll get out of your hair.

28:51.720 --> 28:55.640
Do human parents not love
their children unconditionally?

28:55.800 --> 28:57.920
Sometimes things get complicated.

28:59.560 --> 29:02.160
Many things are complicated,
General Carter.

29:02.320 --> 29:06.000
In Jaffa society,
loving one's children is not one of them.

29:06.160 --> 29:08.800
In human society, sometimes it is.

29:57.080 --> 29:59.280
With these weapons I have provided...

29:59.440 --> 30:06.680
..we will defend against any incursion
by the impure forces outside our gate.

30:06.840 --> 30:10.280
Let no other gods
draw you away from Seth!

30:10.440 --> 30:14.360
Seth is life. Seth is happiness.
Seth is almighty.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.440
Again.

30:15.600 --> 30:19.040
Seth is life. Seth is happiness.
Seth is almighty.

30:19.600 --> 30:22.680
- Again!
- Seth is life. Seth is happiness.

30:23.240 --> 30:25.960
Seth is almighty.

30:34.280 --> 30:36.160
You were once blended.

30:36.320 --> 30:38.680
Were you not?!

30:38.840 --> 30:39.840
Blended?

30:45.240 --> 30:47.160
No entry marks.

30:48.480 --> 30:50.800
But still...

30:51.600 --> 30:53.520
..l sense a trace.

30:55.840 --> 30:57.720
Bring me those who came with her!

30:57.880 --> 31:00.040
General Carter, there is a problem.

31:00.200 --> 31:02.520
- What?
- It's nothing we can't handle.

31:04.440 --> 31:07.880
- He made your people, didn't he?
- We don't know yet.

31:22.680 --> 31:25.160
Who sent you?

31:25.320 --> 31:27.480
The System Lords?

31:29.680 --> 31:31.960
The Tok'ra?

31:33.680 --> 31:36.240
I am your god!

31:36.360 --> 31:39.520
You will tell me what I want to know!

31:39.680 --> 31:43.400
Who does your military work for?
The System Lords or the Tok'ra?

31:43.560 --> 31:47.480
I have a vague recollection
of what you're talking about.

31:48.760 --> 31:50.240
The Tok'ra.

32:03.120 --> 32:04.720
Is it not time enough?

32:04.880 --> 32:06.880
(distorted) No choice. Do it now!

32:12.800 --> 32:14.960
(electricity crackles)

32:20.480 --> 32:25.040
We work for a deprogrammer who hired
us to come remove one of your disciples.

32:25.920 --> 32:28.880
But now we are enjoying
the bliss that is Seth.

32:32.400 --> 32:35.240
How is it possible
that you enjoy the bliss,...

32:36.680 --> 32:39.120
..when you are able to lie to Seth?

32:43.000 --> 32:45.960
My Lord, the impure forces
that you have prophesied...

32:46.120 --> 32:48.880
..are surrounding the compound.

32:49.040 --> 32:52.960
You will pay eternally
for bringing this down upon us.

32:54.920 --> 32:56.920
Take them and kill them.

32:57.080 --> 32:58.400
Go!

33:19.400 --> 33:21.320
A quick question about old Seth.

33:28.600 --> 33:31.520
- What happened?
- It's OK. We're here to help you.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.120
We must distribute them
all over the compound.

33:54.280 --> 33:58.000
We cannot allow the impure
access to all we have built up here.

34:16.880 --> 34:19.320
Um... Daniel.

34:19.480 --> 34:21.400
Tom.

34:21.560 --> 34:23.480
- Levinson?
- Yeah.

34:25.280 --> 34:27.920
Uh, I'm really confused. Who are you?

34:28.800 --> 34:31.719
We're friends of your father.

34:31.880 --> 34:33.840
- Where are the zats?
- Zats?

34:34.199 --> 34:35.880
These.

34:46.679 --> 34:49.719
- Can you activate those transport rings?
- I think so.

34:50.840 --> 34:55.000
Tom, I need you to start transporting
people outta here. Can you handle that?

34:55.159 --> 34:56.560
I... I guess.

34:58.120 --> 34:59.040
Good.

35:09.440 --> 35:15.120
I have to prepare for the worst.
If I don't act, it's on me if they get killed.

35:15.280 --> 35:17.520
It won't be on you. It'll be on me.

35:17.680 --> 35:20.160
It will reside on me also.

35:32.960 --> 35:34.440
Go!

35:41.480 --> 35:44.200
Carter! Go with 'em.
Make sure they get outta here.

35:55.400 --> 35:57.480
OK, I think I've been very patient.

36:04.400 --> 36:08.800
Let's get all the medical teams up here
stat! Get some blankets and shoes!

36:09.680 --> 36:11.600
C'mon, you guys, get in here!

36:20.560 --> 36:22.800
OK! C'mon, let's go! This way! C'mon!

36:37.480 --> 36:40.440
(Seth) How dare you challenge
the power that is Seth?

36:53.400 --> 36:54.720
(roars)

37:10.600 --> 37:12.520
(beeps)

37:28.320 --> 37:30.080
(beeping)

37:33.200 --> 37:35.120
- Bomb?
- Bomb.

37:39.800 --> 37:40.880
Tommy?

37:42.640 --> 37:43.960
Tommy.

38:03.800 --> 38:06.960
General Carter! Our friends
have been neutralised. I must go in.

38:07.120 --> 38:09.360
- Selmak would be of help.
- Who's Selmak?

38:09.520 --> 38:11.440
It's a long story.

38:28.280 --> 38:29.760
(O'Neill) This way!

38:30.200 --> 38:34.520
Teal'c! Cover the other ends.
Make sure he doesn't get out another way.

38:37.880 --> 38:39.280
Dad? Where are you going?

38:39.440 --> 38:42.200
Setesh used the hand device
on O'Neill and Daniel. Are you OK?

38:42.360 --> 38:44.240
I'm fine.

38:46.640 --> 38:48.480
Carter! He's down here!

38:58.960 --> 39:00.520
(distorted) Setesh!

39:00.840 --> 39:02.600
Tok'ra kree chok!

39:10.000 --> 39:13.360
- Dad!
- Your father will survive.

39:13.520 --> 39:15.440
