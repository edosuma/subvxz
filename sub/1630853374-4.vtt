00:20.521 --> 00:23.655

<i> We failed to deliver,</i>

00:25.726 --> 00:27.159
Down lower 48.

00:27.228 --> 00:28.727
That's the bad news.

00:28.729 --> 00:29.828
But the good news?

00:29.830 --> 00:31.764
I've reunited
with my older brother, shane,

00:31.832 --> 00:34.400
<i> Who's just as determined</i>

00:34.402 --> 00:36.301
<i> What the old man was up to,</i>

00:36.303 --> 00:38.237
<i> Because one thing's clear,</i>

00:38.305 --> 00:39.805
<i> When the old man tried</i>

00:39.807 --> 00:41.607
<i> Back in the '80s,</i>

00:41.609 --> 00:43.942

00:45.513 --> 00:46.311
<i> It's gonna be in here.</i>

00:49.850 --> 00:51.050
Oh, wow.

00:52.353 --> 00:53.352
Yeah!

00:53.421 --> 00:54.319
Boom!

00:54.321 --> 00:56.588
<i> I am captain josh harris.</i>

00:56.590 --> 00:57.923
I keep looking in that picture

00:57.925 --> 00:59.725

at me.

00:59.727 --> 01:01.427
<i> Phil harris was my father,</i>

01:26.520 --> 01:27.753
So I'm going through
my dad's stuff

01:27.822 --> 01:29.288
And I find this paper.

01:29.290 --> 01:34.426
Mag bay is one the hottest
fishing spots going right now.

01:34.428 --> 01:36.128
[narrator] <i> but in order</i>
<i> to make any headway...</i>

01:36.130 --> 01:37.796
[casey] it's gotta be
a marlin.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.799
We're smelling what
we're selling today, guys.

01:40.801 --> 01:42.601
<i> I got to lean</i>
<i> on my dad's old friends.</i>

01:43.537 --> 01:45.304
I would think that
if he was down there,

01:45.306 --> 01:46.705
I bet he was fishing.

01:47.641 --> 01:48.841
[narrator] <i> because time...</i>

01:48.909 --> 01:50.709
[jeff] I feel a shocker
on the bull box,

01:50.711 --> 01:52.244
I don't want this guy
chasing our fish.

01:52.346 --> 01:53.212
<i> Is running out.</i>

01:54.115 --> 01:55.214
[casey] right here
under the boat.

01:55.216 --> 01:56.014
[groans]

02:02.690 --> 02:03.956
[casey] <i> we're on, we're on.</i>

02:04.024 --> 02:06.959
[tense music playing]

02:06.961 --> 02:08.060
I just hooked something,
I don't know,

02:08.129 --> 02:09.761
But it's definitely
something good-sized,

02:09.863 --> 02:11.263
It's taking line.

02:11.332 --> 02:12.898
Oh, yeah.

02:12.900 --> 02:14.600
Looks like jeff might be
hooked up right here.

02:16.036 --> 02:17.136
Get him in, brother!

02:17.905 --> 02:19.938
<i> Losing our mainland clients</i>

02:20.007 --> 02:21.907
It was a big setback,
no doubt.

02:21.909 --> 02:24.309
But we're not the type
of guys that sit around
and cry about it.

02:24.311 --> 02:27.146
<i> So, while josh chases down</i>
<i> leads from phil,</i>

02:27.214 --> 02:28.413
<i> Jeff and I</i>
<i> are gonna catch fish</i>

02:28.415 --> 02:30.115
<i> And find places to sell it.</i>

02:30.117 --> 02:32.718
We got 1,000 pound order
from taylor and his poke shop

02:32.720 --> 02:34.052
But we need more.

02:35.489 --> 02:36.822
[jeff] it's gotta be a fish,
if we can get it,

02:36.824 --> 02:38.023
It's a blessing.

02:38.025 --> 02:39.057
Woo!

02:40.127 --> 02:41.560
It's jumping,
he's got a marlin.

02:41.629 --> 02:42.861
Big one.

02:42.930 --> 02:44.229
By the boat
these guys can be a nightmare,

02:44.231 --> 02:46.932
So you just gotta be
really, really careful.

02:47.001 --> 02:49.234
[tense music playing]

02:49.336 --> 02:50.502
[jeff] I'm trying
to get this fish,

02:50.504 --> 02:52.204
But this fish
is also trying to get me.

02:53.707 --> 02:54.806
Oh, oh, oh, oh.

02:56.043 --> 02:57.209
Nice fish, man.

02:58.245 --> 03:00.212
Oh, we got a little splash
back there.

03:00.915 --> 03:02.514
Get him! Get it!

03:04.118 --> 03:05.717
Decent sized marlin,
that's a lot of work

03:05.719 --> 03:07.052
To get over the rail
by yourself.

03:07.721 --> 03:09.054
He can do it, though.

03:10.224 --> 03:11.423
[jeff] oh, back.

03:11.425 --> 03:13.325
[bleep], I'm gaffing
this [bleep] dude.

03:14.762 --> 03:15.561
Woo.

03:15.662 --> 03:17.963
[tense music playing]

03:21.302 --> 03:22.601
[casey] that's at least
100-pounder.

03:25.940 --> 03:27.406
That'll put a dent in it.

03:27.408 --> 03:28.507
Little nightmares.

03:30.311 --> 03:31.510
Nice fish, though.

03:31.512 --> 03:32.711
I'm happy we got him.

03:35.249 --> 03:36.815
[casey] that looks like
a nice one. How big is it?

03:38.118 --> 03:39.518
I think 110?

03:39.520 --> 03:40.686
-[casey] 110? 120?
-Yeah.

03:40.688 --> 03:42.354
You know, something.

03:42.456 --> 03:45.324
<i> Marlin is highly</i>
<i> sought after locally.</i>

03:45.326 --> 03:47.125
When we ship it
to taylor in kauai,

03:47.127 --> 03:49.828
We could probably get
between $8 to $10 a pound.

03:49.830 --> 03:51.730
<i> I respect what josh is doing</i>

03:51.732 --> 03:53.799
<i> Trying to follow</i>
<i> in the old man's footsteps.</i>

03:53.801 --> 03:55.801
But for me, this market,

03:56.503 --> 03:57.603
This is my home.

03:57.605 --> 04:00.939
[tense music playing]

04:05.412 --> 04:06.511
[shane] yeah,
that's a nice truck.

04:06.513 --> 04:07.713
[josh] yeah.

04:08.349 --> 04:10.148
It's a '53? '52?

04:10.250 --> 04:11.216
[shane] nice.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.719
Something my grandpa restored.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.287
Ooh.

04:17.091 --> 04:18.924
And I'll start taking
a peek at things.

04:21.228 --> 04:23.662
<i> The notebooks I found</i>
<i> in my grandpa grant's traile</i>

04:23.731 --> 04:26.398
Had fishing spots written down
from all across the globe.

04:26.834 --> 04:27.833
<i> Look at that.</i>

04:29.937 --> 04:32.104
Ports: Westport, new zealand,

04:32.106 --> 04:33.038
Baja,

04:33.607 --> 04:36.408
H & l to nova scotia.

04:36.410 --> 04:38.210
Maybe there's something
in this locker in seattle

04:38.212 --> 04:39.611
That could connect the dots.

04:42.149 --> 04:43.949
Let's take a little peek
at this.

04:45.619 --> 04:46.618
[shane] <i> what'd you find ther</i>

04:46.686 --> 04:48.153
[josh] I don't know.
I'm about to find out.

04:52.126 --> 04:53.425
Oh, wow.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.062
[josh] louisiana,
gulf of mexico.

04:59.133 --> 05:01.233
I mean, he did go down
to mexico to fish,

05:01.802 --> 05:03.201
But that was for fun.

05:03.203 --> 05:05.103
I remember cozumel,
been there a lot.

05:06.307 --> 05:08.006
He bought me a shirt
when I was a kid.

05:08.008 --> 05:09.308
-[laughs]
-from cozumel.

05:09.310 --> 05:11.143
Dad saves all his charts,
doesn't he?

05:11.244 --> 05:12.844
Yeah. That's what
fishermen do.

05:14.214 --> 05:16.214
But we'll keep this.
Put that in the keep pile.

05:16.216 --> 05:17.015
[shane] all right.

05:18.218 --> 05:19.418
[josh] what else have we got?

05:22.222 --> 05:24.723
Port and boatyard slips.

05:24.725 --> 05:26.425
That's where the cornelia
was built.

05:28.128 --> 05:30.729
Mag bay, I think that's short
for magdalena bay.

05:31.932 --> 05:33.598
Baja mexico, right?

05:34.201 --> 05:35.133
[josh] yeah, I think.

05:35.235 --> 05:37.035
[shane] I swear I saw that
in this book.

05:38.906 --> 05:40.105
[josh] baja peninsula?

05:41.408 --> 05:42.407
[shane] it says
it right there.

05:45.512 --> 05:47.112
Okay. The rocks.

05:47.114 --> 05:50.415
I don't know what a lot
of this stuff is, but yeah.

05:51.318 --> 05:52.517
Do you know anything
about mexico?

05:53.554 --> 05:55.220
-Do you?
-I don't,

05:55.222 --> 05:57.222
But I do know somebody
who does.

05:58.525 --> 06:00.359
And that would be
mr. Wild bill.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.427
<i> If you're looking</i>
<i> for information</i>

06:02.429 --> 06:03.795
<i> On fishing</i>
<i> south of the border,</i>

06:03.797 --> 06:05.330
There's only one man to call.

06:06.700 --> 06:08.700
<i> And he just finished</i>
<i> salmon tendering,</i>

06:08.702 --> 06:10.335
So we may catch him
in a good mood.

06:11.205 --> 06:12.704
Hop in, we're going to dutch.

06:14.108 --> 06:17.109
[tense music playing]

06:19.747 --> 06:23.115
[suspenseful music playing]

06:23.117 --> 06:24.216
[jeff] <i> where's josh at?</i>

06:25.419 --> 06:27.219
Josh is in seattle,
uh, you know,

06:27.221 --> 06:29.121
His got his brother shane
with him.

06:29.123 --> 06:31.123
They kind of wanna go

06:31.125 --> 06:33.225
Explore different things
and see if they can figure out

06:33.227 --> 06:36.528
Some other options
for something to do
in the future.

06:36.530 --> 06:39.965
We support josh in whatever
direction he wants to go,

06:40.000 --> 06:42.200
But for me and casey,

06:42.202 --> 06:44.836
Our priority is rebuilding
this market

06:44.905 --> 06:46.605
Over here in hawaii.

06:46.607 --> 06:48.573
So we're kind of concentrating
on this area,

06:48.575 --> 06:51.209
And hopefully land
some accounts.

06:51.211 --> 06:53.345
Nainoa's born and raised
in kailua-kona, hawaii,

06:53.447 --> 06:55.514
And he's been fishing here
his whole life.

06:55.516 --> 06:56.615
He's plugged in.

06:56.617 --> 06:59.050
He knows exactly who's buying
right now in kona.

07:02.356 --> 07:05.157
There's a tournament
coming up this weekend
you might find interesting.

07:06.427 --> 07:07.959
It's hosted by keoni llanes,

07:08.028 --> 07:09.861
It might be a good opportunity
to get in it.

07:09.897 --> 07:12.230
Keoni llanes,
why does that sound familiar?

07:12.232 --> 07:13.198
It's a really good family,

07:13.200 --> 07:14.599
Really respected family
over here,

07:14.601 --> 07:16.101
Especially in kona.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.602
He has a couple restaurants

07:17.604 --> 07:19.404
With a couple
different locations.

07:19.406 --> 07:21.640
-Really?
-Mmm-hmm.

07:21.708 --> 07:22.941
[casey] why don't we go
to this tournament?

07:22.943 --> 07:24.109
Try to get some face time
with him?

07:25.712 --> 07:26.845
I think there's a right way
to do things

07:26.947 --> 07:28.246
And a wrong way to do things.

07:28.315 --> 07:30.048
And the hawaiian way
to do things.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.516
You just said the
casey way of doing things.

07:31.518 --> 07:33.418

and crank it up a little bit,

09:11.051 --> 09:12.751
And if you got multiple hooks,

09:12.819 --> 09:14.519
You wanna try
to get multiple fish.

09:16.323 --> 09:17.255
All right.

09:18.258 --> 09:19.024
[josh speaking]

09:21.128 --> 09:21.860
[bill] I'm in.

09:23.030 --> 09:24.696
Oh, [bleep].

09:24.698 --> 09:26.698
Bill's got that crazy look
in his eye.

09:27.935 --> 09:29.501
<i> There's a difference</i>
<i> between fishing and catchin'</i>

09:29.503 --> 09:31.603
[josh laughs] <i> come on.</i>

09:36.243 --> 09:38.610
[man] hey, man,
ready for the tournament?

09:38.612 --> 09:41.212
We're at keoni llanes'
fishing tournament today.

09:41.214 --> 09:44.049
Lots of good fishermen,
let's see what happens.

09:44.051 --> 09:45.417
Psyched to get up
and have a good time.

09:45.419 --> 09:46.818
It's gonna be fun.

09:46.820 --> 09:48.386
[dramatic music playing]

09:48.388 --> 09:50.622
[jeff] there's a little bit
of etiquette
when it comes to tournaments.

09:50.624 --> 09:52.357
Watch the brah's,
and the cuz's,

09:52.459 --> 09:53.491
And the shoots, okay?

09:53.493 --> 09:55.327
[casey] I don't use cuz,
we're good.

09:55.329 --> 09:56.928
Keoni's tournament is small,

09:56.930 --> 09:59.831
And the invitations are short,
it's locals only.

09:59.933 --> 10:02.634
<i> But it brings out some of</i>
<i> the best fishermen in kona.</i>

10:03.637 --> 10:04.936
You saying I'm a local now?

10:04.938 --> 10:06.404
You got the tattoo.

10:06.406 --> 10:07.939
I got the tattoo.

10:08.041 --> 10:09.774
And I'm with you, right?

10:09.776 --> 10:11.810
-Casey.
-[man] casey.

10:11.812 --> 10:14.546
Yeah. I am with silva,
jeff silva.

10:14.615 --> 10:17.248
[man] all right, gentlemen,
it's a two-person minimum.

10:17.317 --> 10:18.550
Sign in, please.

10:18.619 --> 10:19.651
[jeff] <i> the rules are simple</i>

10:19.720 --> 10:20.952
The crew with the most meat
on the boat

10:20.954 --> 10:22.921
After two days
of fishing wins.

10:22.923 --> 10:24.756
<i> Everybody gets to keep</i>
<i> what they catch,</i>

10:24.858 --> 10:26.091
So while it's good networking,

10:26.093 --> 10:27.325
<i> We can also punch out</i>
<i> the order</i>

10:27.327 --> 10:28.426
<i> With taylor in kauai.</i>

10:29.429 --> 10:31.129
[man] hold on to your receipt.
Good luck.

10:31.131 --> 10:32.130
[casey] thank you.

10:32.532 --> 10:33.565
Take care, guys.

10:35.402 --> 10:37.135
So where do
you wanna start fishing?

10:37.204 --> 10:38.903
Let's just make our way out
and start heading down,

10:38.905 --> 10:40.639
And try to get
in front of everybody,

10:40.740 --> 10:41.840
And just go from there.

10:41.908 --> 10:42.840
Okay.

10:42.842 --> 10:44.009
Oh, there's kalina and keoni
right there.

10:44.011 --> 10:45.510
Oh, nice. Let's go say hi.

10:46.780 --> 10:47.912
Hi guys.

10:47.914 --> 10:49.214
Hey. Good morning there, jeff.

10:49.216 --> 10:50.048
How you guys doing?

10:50.050 --> 10:51.249
-Good. How are you?
-Good.

10:51.318 --> 10:53.251
Thanks for having us down.
This is casey.

10:53.320 --> 10:55.053
-Hi, I'm kalina.
-Casey, this is kalina,
this is keoni.

10:55.055 --> 10:56.321
-Nice to meet you.
-This is her tournament.

10:56.323 --> 10:57.522
I just wanna introduce
you guys.

10:57.524 --> 10:58.390
Nice to meet you.

10:58.458 --> 10:59.824
-Yeah. Yeah.
-So thanks for having us.

10:59.826 --> 11:01.526
Super stoked.

11:01.528 --> 11:02.927
Where are you guys
gonna go today?

11:02.929 --> 11:03.928
Probably gonna head
down south.

11:03.930 --> 11:04.929
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:04.931 --> 11:06.031
Heard there's some action
down there, so.

11:06.033 --> 11:07.799
[jeff] just you two today?

11:07.801 --> 11:08.733
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

11:08.735 --> 11:10.001
My dad, uh, was supposed
to go with us,

11:10.003 --> 11:11.302
But he had to stay back,

11:11.304 --> 11:12.804
One of my cooks
didn't make it in, so...

11:12.806 --> 11:13.871
-[jeff] oh, no way.
-Yeah.

11:13.940 --> 11:15.306
He's not fishing
with us today unfortunately.

11:15.308 --> 11:16.341
So, it's just me and kalina.

11:16.410 --> 11:17.275
All right.

11:17.277 --> 11:18.309
You're his ace
in the hole anyway,

11:18.311 --> 11:19.344
So ain't no thing.

11:20.447 --> 11:22.514
Well, maybe, uh,

11:22.516 --> 11:24.215
Maybe I can go with you guys.

11:24.217 --> 11:25.550
That way, if we get in
a big marlin,

11:25.619 --> 11:27.118
I can help you get it on.

11:27.120 --> 11:29.054
Kalina doesn't
get stabbed. Okay?

11:29.056 --> 11:30.522
[keoni] yeah,
we could definitely
use your help.

11:30.524 --> 11:31.790
[casey] okay, cool.
Let me go grab my stuff.

11:31.792 --> 11:33.058
[keoni] okay. Sounds good.

11:34.528 --> 11:37.028
Did you just invite yourself
on another man's boat?

11:37.531 --> 11:38.530
Hell yes, I did.

11:38.532 --> 11:39.631
Step one.

11:40.233 --> 11:41.232
Go on his boat.

11:41.234 --> 11:43.301
Network a little bit,
catch some fish.

11:43.303 --> 11:45.737
Step two, next time
he needs fish,

11:45.806 --> 11:46.604
He buys it from us.

11:46.606 --> 11:47.706
Step three.

11:47.708 --> 11:50.508
You're gonna apologize
to keoni after I beat you.

11:51.645 --> 11:53.144
[casey] <i> what's your strategy</i>
<i> what do you wanna do?</i>

11:54.347 --> 11:55.279
We're gonna start trolling,

11:55.281 --> 11:57.315
Probably hit the 500
fathom ledge,

11:57.718 --> 11:59.117
Head down south,

11:59.119 --> 12:01.252
Hopefully get a marlin
or an ono.

12:01.354 --> 12:03.521
[casey] well, whatever we do,
you just got to put us on
some fish.

12:03.523 --> 12:04.655
You know,
that's the nice thing

12:04.724 --> 12:06.524
About you running this boat
right now and not me.

12:06.526 --> 12:07.559
It's your [bleep]
problem, man.

12:09.229 --> 12:10.328
[kalina] <i> hey, let's go.</i>

12:11.231 --> 12:12.630
[casey] <i> you guys ready?</i>

12:12.632 --> 12:14.999
I'm gonna show you
what second place feels like.

12:15.001 --> 12:16.534
[laughing]

12:18.105 --> 12:20.038
Hey, you just remember that
right now.

12:21.208 --> 12:24.442
Since casey jumped ship,
nainoa is gonna fish with me.

12:24.511 --> 12:25.944
<i> I'm not gonna say I upgraded</i>

12:27.114 --> 12:29.748
But if you did,
I'm not gonna argue.

12:30.550 --> 12:34.919
[keoni] five, four,
three, two, one!

12:35.622 --> 12:37.856
-Go!
-[man] go, go, go, go, go.

12:37.957 --> 12:39.557
[man] <i> I bet I'll catch</i>
<i> a bigger fish than you today</i>

12:40.327 --> 12:41.826
Yee-haw.

12:43.563 --> 12:44.729
[tense music playing]

12:44.731 --> 12:49.100
[keoni] five, four,
three, two, one!

12:49.703 --> 12:51.803
[man] go, go, go, go, go.

12:51.805 --> 12:54.105
[man] <i> I bet I'll catch</i>
<i> a bigger fish than you today</i>

12:54.808 --> 12:55.840
Yee-haw.

13:01.148 --> 13:02.647
[laughing]

13:03.917 --> 13:05.116
<i> Jumped on board</i>
<i> with one of the most</i>

13:05.118 --> 13:06.951
<i> Well-known restaurateurs</i>
<i> in all of kona,</i>

13:07.020 --> 13:08.520
<i> To fish this tournament</i>
<i> for the next two days,</i>

13:08.522 --> 13:10.722
And if we win
I could score us an ally

13:10.724 --> 13:11.823
And maybe a new client.

13:12.759 --> 13:13.691
[jeff] <i> it's on.</i>

13:15.562 --> 13:17.962
[keoni] <i> so I heard</i>
<i> a lot about casey.</i>

13:17.964 --> 13:19.397
<i> Apparently</i>
<i> he's a good fisherman.</i>

13:19.399 --> 13:23.001
So we'll see
how he performs today.

13:23.003 --> 13:25.203
[casey] <i> and we're up agains</i>
<i> some strong competition</i>
<i> out there.</i>

13:25.205 --> 13:26.404
So I got to bring my a game.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.139
[keoni] there's fish here.

13:28.241 --> 13:29.307
Oh, look that.

13:30.310 --> 13:33.411
[casey] now we're gonna hunt
and we're gonna fish.

13:33.413 --> 13:35.613
We're gonna throw
the maki-dog.

13:35.615 --> 13:37.415
<i> Maki-dog is a hawaiian way</i>
<i> of fishing.</i>

13:37.417 --> 13:40.919
They take a handkerchief
put a bunch of palu in there,

13:40.921 --> 13:41.719
Palu is bait.

13:41.788 --> 13:43.721
Then you put a hook
in one piece

13:43.723 --> 13:45.657
And they'd wrap it up
in a certain way,

13:45.725 --> 13:46.691
Tie a special knot,

13:46.693 --> 13:48.526
Throw it over
the side of the boat.

13:48.528 --> 13:50.328
Pop it open,
with the slip knot.

13:50.330 --> 13:52.797
The ahi start
just snatching it up

13:52.799 --> 13:55.333
And one of them gets the lucky
number with your hook in it.

13:55.435 --> 13:57.702
That is good. I'm impressed.

13:57.704 --> 13:59.504
You actually know
what you're talking about.

14:00.040 --> 14:01.306
[casey] ready to launch.

14:01.308 --> 14:02.307
Right there, my brother.

14:02.309 --> 14:04.809
[tense music playing]

14:09.115 --> 14:11.249
[casey] see the streak,
that's our lead dropping.

14:11.351 --> 14:12.851
A[keoni] almost 40. Keep
going.

14:12.952 --> 14:13.952
Yup.

14:13.954 --> 14:15.453
[casey] <i> okay.</i>

14:15.522 --> 14:17.522
The second we see anything
come in there.

14:17.524 --> 14:21.125
That is not our maki-dog.
We're gonna bust it open.

14:21.127 --> 14:22.560
And those fish will be
right there close

14:22.662 --> 14:23.628
To bite on it.

14:23.630 --> 14:26.331
[dramatic music playing]

14:32.439 --> 14:33.204
[keoni] we got a mark.

14:33.206 --> 14:34.205
[casey] okay.

14:37.210 --> 14:38.109
We're gonna give her hell.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.745
[keoni] <i> I see one over there</i>

14:40.847 --> 14:42.614
[fishing rod streaking]

14:42.616 --> 14:43.414
[casey] whoa.

14:44.417 --> 14:45.916
We're on.

14:45.918 --> 14:47.051
-[kalina] <i> we're on</i>
<i> with multiple.</i>
-[casey] <i> right here.</i>

14:47.120 --> 14:48.152
Got 'em, yoo-hoo!

14:48.221 --> 14:49.120
[keoni] yeah, buddy.

14:49.956 --> 14:51.155
Ha-ha!

14:51.257 --> 14:53.124
Oh, I love catching mahi-mahi.

14:53.126 --> 14:54.359
Oh god, yeah,
we got a whole school.

14:54.460 --> 14:55.526
-Look at this.
-[keoni] yeah. Yeah.

14:55.528 --> 14:56.995
[kalina] yup, oh.
A whole school. You see 'em?

14:56.997 --> 14:58.329
[keoni] oh, yeah.

14:58.331 --> 15:00.298
It's rare.
We haven't seen a school
like this in a long time.

15:03.203 --> 15:06.304
[casey] oh, boy,
well done guys.

15:06.306 --> 15:07.538
Every pound counts.

15:07.640 --> 15:09.807
Total poundage
is total poundage, man.

15:10.911 --> 15:11.910
[casey] keep chumming them in.

15:14.314 --> 15:16.247
Oh, keoni,
grab some of that, chop, chop!

15:16.349 --> 15:17.949
-[keoni] yes, sir.
-[casey]
ease him up a little bit.

15:23.056 --> 15:25.023
[phone ringing]

15:26.426 --> 15:27.959
[casey] yo, hank,
how you doing brother?

15:28.929 --> 15:30.328
[hank speaking]

15:30.330 --> 15:31.428
[casey] good. Good.

15:31.431 --> 15:32.964
We're over here in hawaii
fishing our butts off.

15:33.033 --> 15:33.932
What are you up to?

15:34.401 --> 15:36.801
[hank speaking]

15:38.738 --> 15:40.004
Kyle?

15:40.006 --> 15:42.206
[hank speaking]

15:42.208 --> 15:43.608
Are you [bleep] kidding me?

15:44.311 --> 15:45.543
[hank speaking]

15:45.612 --> 15:49.647
[casey] <i> oh, god, no.</i>
<i> What happened?</i>

15:49.716 --> 15:51.816
[hank speaking]

15:52.619 --> 15:54.252
Oh, have you talked to josh?

15:55.455 --> 15:57.722
[hank speaking]

15:57.724 --> 16:00.458
I'll call him up.
[bleep], dammit.

16:00.527 --> 16:01.526
[hank] <i> yeah.</i>

16:02.128 --> 16:03.428
[bleep].

16:04.431 --> 16:06.297
[hank speaking]

16:06.299 --> 16:07.298
<i> All right, man.</i>

16:07.300 --> 16:08.433
All right, bye.

16:08.534 --> 16:09.400
[hank] <i> bye.</i>

16:11.304 --> 16:12.303
[bleep].

16:18.511 --> 16:19.510
What happened?

16:20.347 --> 16:22.313
One of my friends passed away.

16:22.315 --> 16:24.816
A guy that worked for me
for a little while. He's a
very good buddy of mine.

16:26.619 --> 16:27.919
<i> Yup, kyle craig,</i>

16:27.921 --> 16:30.021
<i> He crewed on the cornelia</i>
<i> for years.</i>

16:30.023 --> 16:32.256
<i> I grew up with the guy.</i>
<i> I've known him my whole life</i>

16:32.325 --> 16:33.658
<i> Just, you know,</i>

16:33.760 --> 16:34.959
We went to high school
together.

16:35.028 --> 16:37.128
-Opilio.
-Oh my god!

16:37.130 --> 16:38.997
[casey] <i> you would have</i>
<i> some of the worst days</i>
<i> on the bering sea</i>

16:38.999 --> 16:40.498
<i> And kyle would always</i>
<i> get you to laugh.</i>

16:40.500 --> 16:43.034
Looking good now, huh?

16:43.036 --> 16:44.602
He was a close friend.

16:48.508 --> 16:50.408
When's the last time
you spoke to him?

16:50.410 --> 16:51.442
[casey] at the shipyard.

16:51.444 --> 16:53.711
Well, a month and a half,
two months ago.

16:53.713 --> 16:55.079
He stopped by the boat
and he goes,

16:55.081 --> 16:56.347
"dude, I haven't talked
to you forever.

16:56.449 --> 16:58.316
And I figured I could call you
and get told you're busy,

16:58.318 --> 16:59.717
Because you always are,
I can just come down

16:59.719 --> 17:01.452
And see you for a minute."

17:01.521 --> 17:02.920
And right then
I got a phone call

17:02.922 --> 17:05.256
That put me in a bad tailspin
and I had to split off
from him

17:05.358 --> 17:06.824
So I didn't get to give him
a hug goodbye or nothing.

17:06.826 --> 17:08.526
And, you know, that's...

17:08.528 --> 17:09.727
Yeah, you work
so [bleep] much,

17:09.729 --> 17:11.029
You never get to hang out
with your friends

17:11.031 --> 17:12.363
And then you get a phone call
like that

17:12.465 --> 17:14.032
It's just [bleep] ruins you.

17:17.737 --> 17:20.004
You guys mind if we just
pull this and go in?

17:20.807 --> 17:21.706
-No. I mean...
-[casey] yeah.

17:21.708 --> 17:22.940
I really don't wanna fish
right now.

17:23.009 --> 17:24.008
[kalina] no, yeah.

17:25.345 --> 17:26.210
Totally.

17:33.720 --> 17:34.619
[josh] <i> you hooked up yet?</i>

17:34.621 --> 17:36.220
What's going on
over there, <i> cujo?</i>

17:37.957 --> 17:39.357
[shane] <i> I thought I felt</i>
<i> a nibble there.</i>

17:40.060 --> 17:41.225
[josh] <i> no, you didn't.</i>

17:41.227 --> 17:42.026
[shane] <i> yeah, I did.</i>

17:43.463 --> 17:45.063
Oh, I got one.

17:46.433 --> 17:47.565
Here we go.

17:47.633 --> 17:48.933
Woo!

17:49.035 --> 17:50.802
-[josh] oh.
-Yeah, here we go.

17:50.804 --> 17:52.537
Look at that thing, dude.

17:52.638 --> 17:53.638
[bill] dang, brother.

17:53.706 --> 17:55.306
[josh] come on.

17:55.308 --> 17:56.941
[bill] oh, yeah, we're gonna
do some fresh ceviche

17:57.009 --> 17:57.841
Out of that.

17:58.445 --> 18:00.945
Okay. I got to step up
my game.

18:01.013 --> 18:05.049
About to show you the biggest
black bass you ever seen.

18:05.051 --> 18:07.318
Something big
is on the other end of this.

18:07.320 --> 18:08.719
Oh, my goodness.

18:09.322 --> 18:10.254
Oh, we got a whale.

18:10.957 --> 18:12.623
I'm bringing up moby dick.

18:14.360 --> 18:15.359
[shane] three of them.

18:16.429 --> 18:18.830
Yup, that's how
you do it, shane.

18:18.832 --> 18:20.198
-[shane] all right.
-[josh] that's how
you do it.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.799
[bill] three at a time.
That's the way to go.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.401
[josh] now you know
the way I roll, bill.

18:23.403 --> 18:24.302
Both [bleep] burn

18:24.304 --> 18:25.236
And you'd be
the eternal flame?

18:25.338 --> 18:27.839
That's [bleep]
100% correct, my man.

18:33.813 --> 18:35.646
[bill] so do you wanna
go over? What do you
wanna talk about?

18:37.884 --> 18:39.016
Well...

18:40.720 --> 18:41.953
I'm going through
my dad's stuff

18:41.955 --> 18:43.621
And I find this paper...

18:45.058 --> 18:46.524
Maybe you can make sense
of that.

18:47.627 --> 18:49.127
[bill] so where did you
find this?

18:49.129 --> 18:50.094
[josh] my dad
had a storage locker

18:50.096 --> 18:51.562
And I kind of went
and gone through it.

18:51.631 --> 18:54.365
Well, mag bay is one
of the hottest

18:54.433 --> 18:56.100
Fishing spots going right now.

18:56.102 --> 18:57.401
They're breaking world records
out of there.

18:57.403 --> 18:58.202
[josh] really?

18:58.204 --> 19:00.037
Yeah, alijos rocks,

19:00.039 --> 19:01.906
Guadalupe, same thing.

19:03.243 --> 19:04.809
That wasn't the only thing
that was there.

19:07.847 --> 19:09.514
There's charts all the way
from louisiana to florida

19:09.516 --> 19:10.648
In that locker.

19:10.650 --> 19:12.450
Well, that's the gulf
and you know he had to...

19:12.552 --> 19:13.384
Waterway over there?

19:13.386 --> 19:14.652
[bill] when he
brought the boat back,

19:14.654 --> 19:16.220
He had to go through all that
to get through the canal.

19:16.222 --> 19:18.256
That would make sense.

19:18.324 --> 19:20.658
Cornelia like every vessel
built by horton boats

19:20.727 --> 19:21.959
By la batre,

19:22.061 --> 19:23.628
<i> At least ones that crab</i>
<i> the bering sea,</i>

19:23.630 --> 19:26.130
<i> Made their way</i>
<i> through the panama canal</i>

19:26.132 --> 19:28.399
<i> And headed north</i>
<i> parallel to the coast</i>

19:28.401 --> 19:30.101
Before reaching dutch harbor.

19:30.103 --> 19:33.237
[bill] 1980's when the
king crab fishery crashed,

19:33.306 --> 19:36.307
Guys went on lot of different
places looking for work.

19:36.309 --> 19:38.509
With these names at this time

19:38.511 --> 19:40.211
This would only make sense
your dad was looking

19:40.213 --> 19:41.946
At some fisheries
down in mexico.

19:42.048 --> 19:42.846
Really?

19:42.848 --> 19:44.415
Well, your dad
was a high-liner

19:44.417 --> 19:46.050
And these are
high-liner spots so...

19:46.819 --> 19:48.252
[phone ringing]

19:50.557 --> 19:51.556
[josh] yo.

19:53.526 --> 19:55.726
[casey speaking]

19:58.965 --> 19:59.964
Our kyle?

20:00.800 --> 20:02.200
[casey speaking]

20:05.705 --> 20:06.804
How did this happen?

20:07.440 --> 20:11.209
[casey speaking]

20:13.046 --> 20:14.712
Yeah, that's [bleep]
crazy, man.

20:15.448 --> 20:17.415
That's [bleep] crazy.

20:17.417 --> 20:19.717
[casey speaking]

20:19.719 --> 20:21.352
[josh] yeah. No, I know.

20:22.121 --> 20:23.054
[casey] <i> yeah.</i>

20:23.056 --> 20:24.055
[josh] <i> he was a good guy.</i>

20:24.824 --> 20:26.624
Keep your chin up, bud.

20:26.626 --> 20:28.025
[casey speaking]

20:32.732 --> 20:33.598
[shane] you all right, bro?

20:33.600 --> 20:35.032
[sighs]

20:37.837 --> 20:39.036
What's up, man?

20:39.105 --> 20:41.539
One of our old deckhands...

20:43.009 --> 20:44.242
Just passed away.

20:45.311 --> 20:46.544
Who was it?

20:46.646 --> 20:48.112
Kyle craig.

20:48.114 --> 20:50.748
He almost went to work for me
for a while too.

20:50.817 --> 20:51.916
Yeah, he was a good guy.

20:51.918 --> 20:53.818
He worked for us
for a long time.

20:53.820 --> 20:55.920
<i> I planned to see kyle</i>
<i> before king season,</i>

20:55.922 --> 20:57.221
In seattle.

20:57.223 --> 21:00.024
But, uh, you know, it's true,

21:00.026 --> 21:01.959
Life is short sometimes.

21:02.028 --> 21:03.728
And, uh...

21:03.730 --> 21:05.630
<i> Better make the most</i>
<i> of your time when you got it</i>

21:07.934 --> 21:09.033
[bill] why don't we head in?

21:09.102 --> 21:10.367
I'll be on the atom
for a while

21:10.369 --> 21:12.703
Then we'll be able to sit down
and talk about the old man.

21:13.506 --> 21:15.106
Yeah. Thanks, buddy.

21:15.108 --> 21:16.607
All right.
Let's get out of here.

21:26.853 --> 21:28.419
[jeff] <i> what's happening, man</i>

21:28.421 --> 21:29.687
Sorry to hear about kyle, man.

21:29.689 --> 21:30.821
[casey] we're okay, brother.

21:30.823 --> 21:32.023
I know, man. It's all right.

21:32.025 --> 21:33.424
-Love you.
-It's all right, man.

21:33.426 --> 21:35.426
It's like the worst place
to get, like,

21:35.428 --> 21:37.828
News like that, like, ever.

21:39.065 --> 21:39.997
You know what I mean?

21:39.999 --> 21:41.932
It's like, dude,
it's just, uh...

21:44.404 --> 21:47.104
It just makes you wonder
why you spend so much time
on the water.

21:47.106 --> 21:48.506
Right.

21:48.508 --> 21:50.308
-Right. Right.
-Why?

21:51.044 --> 21:52.310
What do you wanna do tomorrow?

21:52.312 --> 21:53.144
What's the plan?

21:58.217 --> 21:59.050
I gotta think about it.

21:59.819 --> 22:01.218
Yup. I understand.

22:01.220 --> 22:02.153
Well, you know what?

22:02.155 --> 22:03.454
Let's get washed up
and, you know,

22:03.556 --> 22:05.623
Let's get cleaned up,
get home, get some sleep,

22:05.625 --> 22:06.657
Think about it.

22:06.759 --> 22:07.958
-I know. Thanks bro.
-All right,, love you man.

22:07.960 --> 22:08.826
[casey] love you.

22:08.828 --> 22:09.860
Appreciate it.

22:13.599 --> 22:14.799
<i> You know, I can't imagine,</i>
<i> you know,</i>

22:14.801 --> 22:16.500
<i> Going through something</i>
<i> like that.</i>

22:16.502 --> 22:17.501
You know, there isn't
a tournament

22:17.503 --> 22:19.036
Or there isn't a fish
that you can catch

22:19.138 --> 22:21.038
That will replace a person.

22:21.140 --> 22:23.040
<i> You know, at this point,</i>
<i> if he does wanna go out ther</i>

22:23.042 --> 22:25.409
And fish tomorrow,
I totally understand.

22:25.411 --> 22:27.745
And if he decides that
he doesn't wanna go

22:27.847 --> 22:28.946
And, you know,
he needs some time

22:28.948 --> 22:31.716
To, you know,
just be with family.

22:31.851 --> 22:33.517
<i> Either way,</i>
<i> I'll be there for him.</i>

22:35.621 --> 22:38.055
[tense music playing]

22:42.228 --> 22:43.861
[josh] how are you doing,
mr. Bill?

22:43.963 --> 22:44.928
[shane] how you doing, bill?

22:45.965 --> 22:48.733
How did, uh,
how did casey take all that?

22:48.801 --> 22:50.668
[josh] he took it
pretty hard, you know.

22:50.670 --> 22:52.103
We all loved kyle.

22:52.805 --> 22:53.838
Only time will tell.

22:53.906 --> 22:55.806
Of course, yeah.

22:55.808 --> 22:57.641
[josh] <i> we're 2,500 miles</i>
<i> away from seattle</i>

22:57.743 --> 22:59.110
<i> And hawaii.</i>

22:59.112 --> 23:01.712
It's been a long few days
to say the least.

23:01.714 --> 23:03.414
<i> But we came here</i>
<i> for a reason.</i>

23:03.416 --> 23:05.116
<i> If anybody knows</i>
<i> about my dad's time</i>

23:05.118 --> 23:06.450
In mexico or the gulf,

23:06.552 --> 23:07.718
It's gonna be wild bill.

23:09.622 --> 23:10.621
These are actually some charts

23:10.623 --> 23:12.656
That we found
in the old man's locker.

23:15.027 --> 23:16.460
[bill] yeah, I've been
all through here.

23:16.562 --> 23:18.462
-[josh] you have been?
-[bill] yeah.

23:18.564 --> 23:21.265
I mean, you got the gulf
and you got the atlantic.

23:21.333 --> 23:23.234
This is great fishing
through here.

23:23.335 --> 23:25.436
When we were out the other
day, you showed me a list.

23:25.505 --> 23:27.271
You know, mag bay, guadalupe.

23:27.273 --> 23:28.439
Yeah.

23:28.441 --> 23:30.941
Those are the hot spots
in the west coast, on baja.

23:31.010 --> 23:32.343
-[josh] okay.
-And that's a whole
different world.

23:32.445 --> 23:35.713
I mean, it's a completely
different fishery.

23:35.715 --> 23:37.648
You mean, it's a good
fishing spot or...

23:37.750 --> 23:38.782
It's tremendous.

23:38.784 --> 23:40.718
It's in the latitudes
where you have a lot of...

23:40.720 --> 23:44.655
Lot of currents that bring in
these nutrient-dense waters.

23:44.724 --> 23:46.624
I mean, that's why
it's big on tourism,

23:46.626 --> 23:48.726
That's why it's big
on sport fishing.

23:48.728 --> 23:49.727
In fact, it's...

23:49.729 --> 23:51.529
They're leaning way more

23:51.531 --> 23:53.063
Towards catch and release
over there.

23:54.434 --> 23:56.000
Yeah, we're selling, I mean,

23:56.002 --> 23:57.935
That doesn't mean
anything for us.

23:58.037 --> 23:59.804
Phil might've been
fishing tuna in mexico

23:59.806 --> 24:01.739
But between '80 and '86,

24:01.808 --> 24:03.040
There was an embargo.

24:03.910 --> 24:06.110
So basically,
mexican government

24:06.112 --> 24:07.745
Didn't want us, the americans,

24:07.814 --> 24:09.747
Harvesting tuna
in their waters.

24:09.816 --> 24:11.515
And obviously we didn't want
the mexicans

24:11.517 --> 24:13.050
Harvesting tuna in our waters.

24:13.052 --> 24:14.518
It's just like us
with crab and russia,

24:14.520 --> 24:15.519
You know, it's...
It was a war.

24:16.255 --> 24:17.822
It got pretty heated.

24:17.824 --> 24:19.523
So he couldn't have fished
for them?

24:20.693 --> 24:22.226
Not commercially for tuna.

24:22.228 --> 24:24.462
[tense music playing]

24:24.530 --> 24:26.130
[bill] you know unless he was
fishing mexican waters

24:26.132 --> 24:27.431
From somewhere else.

24:29.502 --> 24:30.234
I don't get it.

24:30.937 --> 24:31.902
Well, think about it.

24:32.672 --> 24:34.905
Your dad was down here
in the '80s.

24:34.907 --> 24:37.441
You know, he was in alabama,
by la batre,

24:37.543 --> 24:39.610
Working boats,
building a boat.

24:39.612 --> 24:41.045
If he was gonna fish,

24:41.047 --> 24:42.613
He would be fishing
in the gulf.

24:43.749 --> 24:45.916
Do you think
it would be over here

24:45.918 --> 24:47.351
Instead of over there?

24:47.453 --> 24:49.019
I would think
that if he was down there,

24:49.722 --> 24:51.055
I'll bet he was fishing.

24:52.825 --> 24:55.226
Finding out what my dad
was up to.

24:55.228 --> 24:56.927
I mean, that's one of the most
important things.

24:57.597 --> 24:59.129
I gotta figure this out.

25:00.500 --> 25:01.632
You're going to the gulf, man.

25:02.902 --> 25:04.401
[josh] <i> bayou la batre,</i>
<i> alabama.</i>

25:04.403 --> 25:06.704
<i> It's known</i>
<i> for shrimp, shipyards,</i>

25:06.706 --> 25:09.039
<i> But not big tuna.</i>

25:09.108 --> 25:10.941
Going there is a gamble
but it was also a gamble

25:11.043 --> 25:12.343
To build
the cornelia marie there.

25:12.411 --> 25:14.912
And that turned out
pretty damn good.

25:14.914 --> 25:17.915
Besides, it's one place I know
for sure the old man went.

25:25.424 --> 25:27.625
[tense music playing]

25:28.327 --> 25:30.060
[kalina] <i> you made it.</i>

-[keoni] morning, sir.
-[casey] morning, bro.

25:33.799 --> 25:36.000
I appreciate your support
yesterday, man.

25:36.002 --> 25:37.801
I wanna go out there
and catch fish for my buddy.

25:37.803 --> 25:39.103
[kalina] for sure.

25:39.105 --> 25:41.138
There's one thing that
I've learned
growing up fishing,

25:41.240 --> 25:43.607
It's always do
what you say you're gonna do.

25:43.609 --> 25:45.943
And you have to finish
what you start.

25:46.045 --> 25:47.811
<i> I've got one day left</i>
<i> in this tournament,</i>

25:47.813 --> 25:49.313

25:50.416 --> 25:51.348
<i> Let's go catch a fish,</i>
<i> all right?</i>

25:51.350 --> 25:52.349
[kalina] <i> yeah.</i>

25:55.555 --> 25:56.921
[jeff] <i> beautiful morning</i>
<i> out here.</i>

25:56.923 --> 25:58.122
<i> Sun coming up.</i>

25:58.691 --> 26:00.124
Wow, that's pretty cool.

26:02.795 --> 26:05.529
Maybe that's casey's buddy
kyle smiling down on 'em.

26:06.732 --> 26:08.532
<i> Day two, so we're gonna</i>
<i> give it a shot</i>

26:08.601 --> 26:09.800
And ready for a big one.

26:09.802 --> 26:11.235
Let's hang onto one today.

26:12.104 --> 26:13.304
[jeff] <i> yesterday, nainoa and</i>

26:13.306 --> 26:14.538
<i> Didn't end up</i>
<i> catching anything.</i>

26:14.607 --> 26:17.041
And the day ended up
getting cut short.

26:17.142 --> 26:19.443
So we've gotta produce
to have a shot
in this tournament

26:19.545 --> 26:21.011
<i> And get the rest</i>
<i> of the 800 pounds</i>

26:21.013 --> 26:22.613
<i> That we need</i>
<i> to send to kauai.</i>

26:24.750 --> 26:26.317
We went south yesterday,

26:26.319 --> 26:29.019
So today we're fishing
a little bit more north.

26:29.021 --> 26:30.554
And, uh, we're fishing
a little bit deeper

26:30.623 --> 26:32.323
On the thousand.

26:32.325 --> 26:35.059
They call it the thousand
because it's a thousand
fathoms deep,

26:35.061 --> 26:37.628
The contour of the island
is very steep.

26:37.630 --> 26:39.930
<i> It drops off really quick.</i>

26:39.932 --> 26:41.298
Today it seems productive
and a lot of it

26:41.300 --> 26:43.300
Is because we see birds
flying around

26:43.302 --> 26:45.402
<i> And so, you know, we'll jus</i>
<i> kinda stick with it,</i>

26:45.404 --> 26:47.204
Wait for one of these guys
to bite.

26:48.474 --> 26:49.740
<i> You know, pressure's on.</i>

26:53.546 --> 26:55.312
I see some splashes
over there.

26:55.314 --> 26:56.246
Check that out.

27:01.020 --> 27:02.553
[beeps]

27:02.655 --> 27:04.054
[jeff] so, we just marked
a fish right here.

27:04.590 --> 27:06.523
[beeping]

27:06.525 --> 27:07.825
[nainoa] [bleep] going nuts.

27:08.461 --> 27:11.362
[tense music playing]

27:11.463 --> 27:12.563
Oh, right there.

27:12.631 --> 27:13.631
Hooked up.

27:15.034 --> 27:15.933
[nainoa] oh, it's a huge one.

27:16.002 --> 27:17.134
Oh, a big blow up.

27:17.603 --> 27:18.802
[beeping]

27:19.505 --> 27:20.704
[jeff] oh, man.

27:21.741 --> 27:22.740
We got a big pile
of mahi-mahis

27:22.808 --> 27:23.941
Behind the boat right now.

27:26.045 --> 27:27.044
[nainoa] yeah, yeah.

27:28.014 --> 27:29.013
Here we go.

27:29.849 --> 27:30.914
We're in it.

27:32.718 --> 27:34.151
Another one.

27:34.253 --> 27:38.422
Mahi-mahi, they're good,
13 to 17 pounders.

27:38.424 --> 27:40.224
And a situation like this,
you gotta try

27:40.226 --> 27:41.692
And keep 'em behind the boat
as long as you can

27:41.694 --> 27:43.527
Because you don't know
how long they're gonna stay.

27:44.030 --> 27:45.029
Got one on.

27:47.700 --> 27:49.199
Oh, my god.

27:51.303 --> 27:52.036
Another one on.

27:52.605 --> 27:53.504
All right. Here it comes.

27:53.506 --> 27:54.538
[jeff] I got 'em.

27:56.809 --> 27:57.808
[nainoa] nice fish, man.

28:00.846 --> 28:02.713
<i> Awesome one, man.</i>
<i> Awesome.</i>

28:03.949 --> 28:05.916
We're gonna hang here.
This is the spot.

28:05.918 --> 28:07.351
Just gonna hang out
right out front...

28:07.420 --> 28:08.152
The front door.

28:08.220 --> 28:10.254
[seagulls squawking]

28:11.524 --> 28:13.223
So I think we just stay
out front in...

28:13.225 --> 28:15.859
Between keauhou
and captain cook monument

28:15.928 --> 28:17.361
And just work this area.

28:17.430 --> 28:19.730
Maybe get better luck out here
on the big game.

28:19.732 --> 28:20.664
[casey] sounds good.

28:20.733 --> 28:21.598
I saw life there yesterday.

28:21.600 --> 28:22.900
Maybe they're still around.

28:24.303 --> 28:26.704
<i> Hopefully it's the biting</i>
<i> kind of life today.</i>

28:26.706 --> 28:29.640
<i> There's no doubt that</i>
<i> we're behind in poundage</i>
<i> right now.</i>

28:29.709 --> 28:31.642
We only caught a few
mahi-mahi yesterday.

28:31.711 --> 28:32.943
If we're gonna win,

28:32.945 --> 28:34.511
We're gonna have to hook
something a lot bigger.

28:36.215 --> 28:37.614
You got anything
you wanna run today?

28:38.217 --> 28:39.450
Uh...

28:40.720 --> 28:42.653
Just probably like a jet
or a bullet or something.

28:42.755 --> 28:43.454
Yeah.

28:43.555 --> 28:44.955
[keoni] yeah.

28:44.957 --> 28:45.723
You got it, man.

28:45.725 --> 28:46.623
[casey] oh.

28:46.625 --> 28:48.058
Here we go. We're on, guys.

28:48.127 --> 28:49.126
[reeling stops]

28:50.262 --> 28:51.228
[bleep].

28:52.064 --> 28:53.063
We were on.

28:56.802 --> 28:57.801
I think we lost it.

28:57.803 --> 28:59.636
Oh.

28:59.705 --> 29:01.605
-[keoni speaking]
-[casey] had the drag set
too light, I think,

29:01.607 --> 29:03.073
Or he spit it out,

29:03.075 --> 29:05.209
Whatever it was, but he took
some line there,

29:05.211 --> 29:06.944
We gotta get this thing back
in the water right away.

29:06.946 --> 29:08.412
Do you have any other
live bait rods ready?

29:08.414 --> 29:09.213
[keoni] yeah.

29:09.215 --> 29:12.549
[tense music playing]

29:14.820 --> 29:16.019
There's gotta be
another fish here,

29:16.021 --> 29:17.921
Where it's gonna feed out
a live bait here.

29:20.860 --> 29:22.726
Feel 'em kick
in there a little.

29:22.728 --> 29:23.861
When you see 'em
fluttering like that,

29:23.929 --> 29:25.529
It means something's around
that's eyeballing them,

29:25.531 --> 29:26.830
They saw something
they don't like.

29:29.502 --> 29:30.834
He's getting a little nervous.

29:34.640 --> 29:35.806
-[reel whirring]
-there he goes.

29:35.808 --> 29:37.841
We're on. Oh, we're on.

29:37.910 --> 29:39.142
Holy [bleep].

29:39.144 --> 29:40.944
Yeah, we're on. Look at
the way that thing's flying.

29:41.647 --> 29:42.813
We're on here.

29:44.049 --> 29:45.048
Wow.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.050
That's a big fish.

29:47.052 --> 29:48.619
Casey, what's it doing, man?

29:51.624 --> 29:52.356
Oh, there he is.

29:52.925 --> 29:54.324
You see him right there?

29:54.326 --> 29:56.727
They're smelling what
we're selling today, guys.

30:01.934 --> 30:02.933
Gotta be a marlin.

30:03.602 --> 30:04.301
[keoni] oh, there he is.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.037
You see him right there?

30:07.039 --> 30:10.407
They're smelling what
we're selling today, guys.

30:10.409 --> 30:13.110
<i> I've got my first big pelagi</i>
<i> of the tournament on the hoo</i>

30:13.112 --> 30:15.245
And a potential client
watching every move.

30:16.415 --> 30:18.215
<i> I'm trying to land</i>
<i> more than just a fish here.</i>

30:21.954 --> 30:23.554
Casey, what's it doing, man?

30:23.622 --> 30:24.922
Pulling tight.

30:24.924 --> 30:26.323
-Straight that way.
-Okay.

30:28.627 --> 30:29.726
[casey] as the boat dips here,

30:31.030 --> 30:32.462
We're cranking.

30:32.531 --> 30:33.931
Pull up, it pulls the fish up,

30:33.933 --> 30:35.165
It's basically like pulling up
on the rod,

30:35.201 --> 30:36.600
We're just letting
the boat do the work.

30:38.537 --> 30:40.504
I think this is it, guys.

30:40.506 --> 30:42.639
Assuming nobody else catches
something bigger today.

30:43.042 --> 30:44.041
Turning.

30:44.944 --> 30:46.009
[keoni] turning.

30:47.513 --> 30:48.545
[casey] he's going
that way now.

30:49.915 --> 30:52.549
He's not happy...
Yeah, that's a nice fish.

30:52.651 --> 30:53.450
-[kalina] yup.
-[keoni] yup.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.619
We're getting close.

30:55.621 --> 30:57.054
I see color, man. Right here.

30:57.056 --> 30:59.223
[tense music playing]

30:59.225 --> 31:00.824
Oh, yeah. He's comin' up.

31:00.826 --> 31:02.960
[kalina] oh, he's a nice fish.

31:02.962 --> 31:05.362
I'd say it's what?
250, 300-pound fish?

31:05.430 --> 31:07.130
[keoni] that's what it
looks like.

31:07.132 --> 31:09.233
[casey] he's right here,
get a gaff ready.

31:09.334 --> 31:10.367
[keoni] yup.

31:10.369 --> 31:11.702
[casey] never seen
a real artist in action, yet.

31:11.704 --> 31:13.303
-[keoni laughs]
-[casey] that's it.

31:16.709 --> 31:17.808
Yeah.

31:17.810 --> 31:18.809
Got a second gaff?

31:20.546 --> 31:21.545
[casey] ready?

31:21.647 --> 31:23.013
[keoni] on three,
up and over on this side.

31:23.015 --> 31:25.115
-One, two, three.
-Two, three.

31:25.451 --> 31:26.350
[grunts]

31:27.319 --> 31:28.318
[casey] watch out the bill.

31:29.955 --> 31:30.954
-Woo!
-[kalina] woo!

31:31.023 --> 31:32.556
Good job guys! [laughs]

31:32.625 --> 31:33.857
There it is.

31:33.926 --> 31:35.859
-Yeah.
-Yeah. [bleep].

31:36.629 --> 31:38.262
[laughs]

31:39.331 --> 31:40.931
Oh, [bleep].

31:40.933 --> 31:42.199
[casey] oh, my god.

31:42.201 --> 31:43.233
[kalina] holy [bleep].

31:43.302 --> 31:44.434
That one's for kyle.

31:45.037 --> 31:46.203
Thank you, keoni.

31:46.939 --> 31:49.139
Wow, what a fish.

31:49.241 --> 31:51.608
Catching a marlin this size
never gets old

31:51.610 --> 31:53.210
No matter how often you do it.

31:54.313 --> 31:56.013
<i> And it puts us in the runnin</i>
<i> to win this thing.</i>

31:59.151 --> 31:59.950
[beeps]

32:02.988 --> 32:05.222
[nainoa] oh,
big ahi right there.

32:05.224 --> 32:07.157
Huge ahi, look at that,

32:07.225 --> 32:08.859
Big explosion on the surface
right there,

32:10.029 --> 32:10.961
Nice white water.

32:11.964 --> 32:13.964
We got fish jumping
around the boat,

32:13.966 --> 32:15.198
So, you know,

32:15.200 --> 32:17.034
We know the fish
are in the area.

32:19.605 --> 32:20.504
[rod whirring]

32:21.941 --> 32:22.973
We're on.

32:25.511 --> 32:27.110
Nice and tight.
Straight down, right now.

32:27.112 --> 32:28.211
It's pumping, so...

32:29.949 --> 32:31.114
It feels like a nice ahi.

32:32.418 --> 32:33.951
[suspenseful music playing]

32:34.019 --> 32:35.052
[jeff] we're gonna switch.

32:36.088 --> 32:37.821
It feels like
a really good-sized fish.

32:37.823 --> 32:39.656
We're just being patient
with him.

32:39.725 --> 32:41.124
There's no sense
trying to muscle him.

32:42.127 --> 32:44.194
It's actually better
to keep the fish down deep

32:44.196 --> 32:46.229
Because the water is cooler,

32:46.231 --> 32:49.199
So that way the body
temperature of the fish
will stay cooler.

32:49.201 --> 32:51.601
If you keep the fish high
and he gives you a hard time,

32:51.603 --> 32:53.003
You know, a lot of
times that's how your fish

32:53.005 --> 32:54.805
Can become what we call
brown burn.

32:56.041 --> 32:57.107
The meat will look like
its bruised

32:57.109 --> 32:58.608
Or it's even been cooked,

32:58.610 --> 33:01.044
So all we can do
is just be patient,

33:01.113 --> 33:02.746
Play it slow and get this guy.

33:05.150 --> 33:06.850
We should see color here
any second.

33:15.761 --> 33:16.760
Nice fish.

33:19.031 --> 33:20.130
[nainoa] all right.

33:20.132 --> 33:21.598
-Nice, pal. Good job man.
-Nice fish, pal.

33:21.600 --> 33:22.332
Good job.

33:23.002 --> 33:24.301
Looks about 140.

33:25.304 --> 33:26.703
Beautiful fish.

33:26.705 --> 33:28.138
<i> We signed up</i>
<i> for this tournament</i>

33:28.207 --> 33:29.506
To make inroads with keoni.

33:29.508 --> 33:31.742

and knock out this order

33:31.810 --> 33:33.710
<i> For taylor at the same time</i>

33:33.712 --> 33:35.112
But it's still a competition

33:35.114 --> 33:36.413
And I don't like losing.

33:37.249 --> 33:38.749
We're on the board.

33:38.850 --> 33:40.717
Try to get another one,
that's the plan.

33:42.121 --> 33:43.253
Tournament's not over.

33:45.290 --> 33:48.325

[bill] josh.

33:57.936 --> 33:59.102
Dude.

33:59.104 --> 34:00.704
I did some thinking and...

34:01.774 --> 34:04.508
If I can actually help you
guys figure this out

34:04.510 --> 34:05.609
What the old man was doing,

34:05.611 --> 34:07.611
-I'll give you a hint.
-Really?

34:07.613 --> 34:09.012
I could streamline this
for you a lot.

34:09.014 --> 34:10.714
I know a bunch of people
down there and...

34:10.716 --> 34:12.149
Dude, that's great news.

34:12.217 --> 34:13.150
[bill] it should be good.

34:13.251 --> 34:14.484
I looked at it and I think
I can pull it off.

34:14.486 --> 34:16.053
Dude, you have no clue
how big of a help
that's gonna be.

34:16.121 --> 34:17.320
[bill] no, it'll be good.

34:17.322 --> 34:18.588
I'd like to see
what he was doing too.

34:18.590 --> 34:20.524
-It's... I'm curious.
-Yeah.

34:20.526 --> 34:22.159
<i> One of the benefits</i>
<i> for having a career</i>

34:35.507 --> 34:37.607
Even for an old cranky
[bleep] like me.

34:37.609 --> 34:39.509
[laughs]

34:39.511 --> 34:40.911
Yeah. There's only
one rule for me.

34:40.913 --> 34:41.878
What's that?

34:41.880 --> 34:44.114
Any heavy bags,
any heavy lifting...

34:44.950 --> 34:46.416
You got it dude.
I'm here for it.

34:46.418 --> 34:47.617
[laughs] yeah.

34:47.619 --> 34:49.453
-[bill] we got the bus.
-[chuckles] dude.

34:49.521 --> 34:50.453
All right.

34:50.455 --> 34:51.955
Well, let's get down
south then, cool.

34:56.428 --> 34:58.128
[jeff] <i> yeah, man,</i>
<i> let's get our lines back out</i>

34:58.130 --> 34:59.429
-[nainoa] <i> yeah.</i>
-[jeff] <i> let's get back set.</i>

35:00.332 --> 35:02.599
[tense music playing]

35:02.601 --> 35:04.201
[jeff] <i> rather than, kind of</i>
<i> going back up in an area</i>

35:04.203 --> 35:06.036
<i> Where we've been spending</i>
<i> a lot of time,</i>

35:06.038 --> 35:07.270
<i> The fish there</i>
<i> might have eaten</i>

35:07.272 --> 35:09.639
<i> And they might just be</i>
<i> kind of resting.</i>

35:09.741 --> 35:11.074
But the fish
that are up current,

35:11.076 --> 35:12.709
You know, they might be
feeding more aggressive,

35:14.046 --> 35:16.746
<i> So we'll kind of</i>
<i> start working our way up</i>

35:16.815 --> 35:18.915
And, you know, maybe there's
another one in here

35:18.917 --> 35:20.016
That wants to bite.

35:22.521 --> 35:23.253
[rod whirring]

35:25.357 --> 35:26.423
Hooked up again.

35:27.559 --> 35:28.825
Good size fish,

35:28.827 --> 35:29.926
It feels about the same size

35:29.928 --> 35:31.061
As the one we just had.

35:32.965 --> 35:34.264
We got a shark
around the boat, bro.

35:34.299 --> 35:35.765
-[nainoa] shark?
-Yeah.

35:35.767 --> 35:37.134
-[nainoa] 20 yards...
-[jeff] 20 yards,
30 yards up at the back.

35:38.203 --> 35:39.302
That's not good.

35:39.304 --> 35:40.303
We got a big fish on,
I don't want this guy

35:40.305 --> 35:41.238
Chasing our fish.

35:41.339 --> 35:42.606
Going right through
your fish right now,

35:42.608 --> 35:43.507
Right through my fish,

35:43.509 --> 35:44.741
Right here under the boat.

35:49.848 --> 35:50.914
[tense music playing]

35:50.916 --> 35:51.848
[casey] <i> we got</i>
<i> a good group today,</i>

35:51.917 --> 35:52.949
<i> Hopefully we'll hook</i>
<i> a big one.</i>

35:54.119 --> 35:55.152
We're gonna win, right guys?

35:55.220 --> 35:56.719
[kalina] we're gonna win.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.054
-We're gonna win this.
-[casey] I heard you llanes'
can smell fish?

35:58.624 --> 35:59.923
-[keoni] we try.
-Yeah?

35:59.925 --> 36:01.758
You look for that marlin
farting bubbles.

36:01.827 --> 36:03.059
[casey] oh, is that...

36:03.061 --> 36:05.028
-Like phil would say,
the crab fart bubbles.
-Yeah.

36:05.030 --> 36:06.930
[phil] <i> these crabs have gas</i>

36:06.932 --> 36:09.399
Find those fart bubbles,
we got it made.

36:09.935 --> 36:11.201
You watch.

36:11.203 --> 36:13.103
If there's fart bubbles,
there's crabs.

36:14.406 --> 36:15.238
[casey] <i> what do they</i>
<i> smell like?</i>

36:15.941 --> 36:16.740
A little fishy.

36:16.742 --> 36:18.441
[casey] a little fishy.
[laughs]

36:23.015 --> 36:24.948
[rod whirring]

36:24.950 --> 36:26.449
[jeff] there's a shark
around the boat, bro.

36:26.551 --> 36:27.817
-[nainoa] shark?
-Yeah.

36:29.221 --> 36:30.187
We got a big fish on.

36:30.189 --> 36:31.821
I don't want this guy
chasing our fish.

36:32.658 --> 36:34.357
Grab the leader,
grab the line.

36:34.459 --> 36:35.425
[nainoa] right here
under the boat.

36:35.527 --> 36:37.427
Oh, oh, whoa.

36:40.799 --> 36:42.299
[jeff] bro.

36:42.301 --> 36:45.001
Fly that dead bait
off the back port corner.

36:45.003 --> 36:46.403
I want this guy
away from the boat.

36:46.405 --> 36:49.406
[suspenseful music playing]

36:49.408 --> 36:51.007
[jeff] let's feed this guy.

36:51.009 --> 36:52.209
Throw the whole ones, nai.

36:52.844 --> 36:53.810
Fill this guy up.

36:55.414 --> 36:57.013
The shark is pretty aggressive
right now.

36:57.015 --> 36:58.915
We don't want them
to come and eat our fish.

37:00.052 --> 37:01.518
Hopefully it fills up
and he can eat some more

37:01.520 --> 37:02.719
Of our chum out there.

37:05.324 --> 37:07.023
[jeff] <i> we still need</i>
<i> about 600 pounds</i>

37:07.025 --> 37:09.025
<i> For our poke shop order.</i>

37:09.027 --> 37:10.760
The shark is gonna go
for anything in the water

37:10.829 --> 37:12.128
That he sees as food,

37:12.130 --> 37:13.763
<i> But if we can give him</i>
<i> an easy meal,</i>

37:13.832 --> 37:15.298
<i> He'll leave our tuna alone.</i>

37:15.300 --> 37:17.701
Even if it means sacrificing
all of our old palu

37:17.703 --> 37:18.935
To keep him at bay.

37:20.305 --> 37:21.938
[nainoa speaking]

37:21.940 --> 37:22.806
[jeff] that's good bro.

37:22.808 --> 37:24.007
That's good, that's good.
Perfect.

37:26.211 --> 37:27.711
The fish hasn't gotten
bit yet.

37:29.948 --> 37:31.147
Not yet.

37:31.216 --> 37:32.282
[nainoa] right here
I can see color.

37:32.350 --> 37:33.516
[jeff] yeah, color.

37:33.518 --> 37:36.253
[suspenseful music playing]

37:39.424 --> 37:41.324
[jeff] I don't like this
at all.

37:41.326 --> 37:42.859
This is the most critical part
of the fight,

37:42.928 --> 37:44.561
Is right here.

37:44.663 --> 37:46.463
The fish at this point now,
he sees the boat,

37:47.799 --> 37:50.100
So we wanna tie him his circle
so that we can get him up,

37:50.736 --> 37:52.102
Try to get his head up.

37:54.506 --> 37:56.840
Right here. Here he comes.

38:01.813 --> 38:03.213
[nainoa] oh, bro.

38:03.215 --> 38:04.948
The shark is going right
to your fish right now.

38:05.083 --> 38:06.149
It's going right
to my fish.

38:08.020 --> 38:09.152
I'm not happy about
where he's hooked,

38:09.221 --> 38:10.253
I can't see his hook.

38:11.056 --> 38:11.855
Go get him.

38:12.791 --> 38:13.556
Right there.

38:17.963 --> 38:18.962
[nainoa] all right.

38:18.964 --> 38:19.963
[jeff] nice fish.

38:20.032 --> 38:20.830
[nainoa] nice one.

38:27.539 --> 38:29.039
[jeff] that's ahi, baby.

38:29.107 --> 38:30.940
That's what we're looking for
right there.

38:30.942 --> 38:33.610
Grab him up now,
second one on the boat.

38:33.612 --> 38:35.945
Got some good weight,
this one looks about 130.

38:36.047 --> 38:37.514
So it's awesome.

38:38.850 --> 38:40.650
If I had to guess
in a rough estimate,

38:40.719 --> 38:43.653
I'd say we're maybe
sitting on about 450.

38:43.755 --> 38:45.522
So we're sitting pretty.

38:47.059 --> 38:48.458
[casey] <i> what's up guys?</i>

38:48.560 --> 38:50.026
[jeff] <i> tired but happy, man</i>

38:50.128 --> 38:51.761
It's good to see you out here.
I'm glad you showed up.

38:52.064 --> 38:52.829
Yeah.

38:52.831 --> 38:54.097
I want... I want to be here,

38:54.099 --> 38:56.499
Do this and catch fish
for kyle.

38:56.501 --> 38:57.434
[jeff] right on, man.

38:57.535 --> 38:58.535
Way to bounce back.

38:58.603 --> 38:59.402
[casey] what you got?

38:59.404 --> 39:00.303
You got the yellow?

39:00.305 --> 39:01.638
We got a couple ahi's.

39:01.673 --> 39:04.007
We got one maybe about
150 and one about 140

39:04.009 --> 39:07.410
And we got a pretty good load
of mahi-mahis too.

39:07.412 --> 39:08.511
All right.

39:08.513 --> 39:10.513
Let's go hang these things,
go see what we got.

39:10.515 --> 39:11.815
[jeff] sounds good.
See you inside.

39:16.722 --> 39:18.755
[tense music playing]

39:21.026 --> 39:24.027
[rock music playing]

39:25.163 --> 39:27.764
[josh] <i> hotter than a snake'</i>
<i> ass out here, isn't it?</i>

39:27.832 --> 39:30.800
Bit of a breeze,
but holy smokes.

39:30.802 --> 39:32.035
Look at all
these boats out here.

39:33.004 --> 39:34.904
This is a boat building
mecca down here

39:34.906 --> 39:38.441
And the seafood industry
is alive and strong.

39:38.510 --> 39:40.710
<i> If you told me 48 hours ago</i>
<i> I'd be riding shotgun</i>

39:40.712 --> 39:42.312
<i> With captain wild bill</i>

39:42.314 --> 39:44.714
And have my brother shane
with me in alabama,

39:44.716 --> 39:46.416
I would've called you nuts.

39:46.418 --> 39:48.852
But here we are,
bayou la batre,

39:48.920 --> 39:51.755
The birthplace
of the cornelia marie.

39:51.856 --> 39:53.323
First we got to find out
if the old man

39:53.325 --> 39:55.258
Ever actually
fished down here.

39:55.326 --> 39:57.227
There's gotta be
something to, you know,

39:57.229 --> 39:58.261
About coming down here.

39:58.363 --> 40:00.830
I mean the old man
had the boat built down here.

40:00.832 --> 40:02.365
It's kind of why the story
started isn't it?

40:03.101 --> 40:04.033
That's correct.

40:04.736 --> 40:06.603
<i> One thing my dad</i>
<i> always told me.</i>

40:06.605 --> 40:08.204
<i> When you're on a crossroads</i>

40:08.206 --> 40:10.940
Don't be afraid to take
the unbeaten path.

40:10.942 --> 40:13.543
Life is too short
to stay in one place,

40:14.146 --> 40:15.512
<i> Besides, you never know</i>

40:15.514 --> 40:17.147
<i> Who you're gonna encounter</i>
<i> along the way.</i>

40:18.817 --> 40:19.949
Do you mind taking
a picture for us?

40:20.018 --> 40:21.150
Yeah.

40:21.620 --> 40:23.353
[josh] <i> who you'll come</i>
<i> to count on...</i>

40:23.421 --> 40:24.421
So me and keoni
had been talking

40:24.423 --> 40:27.590
And we'd like to do
business with you guys.

40:27.592 --> 40:30.160
-Good deal man. Thank you.
-Appreciate it.

40:30.261 --> 40:31.728
[josh] ... <i> And who will choo</i>
<i> to believe in you</i>

40:31.730 --> 40:32.829
<i> And give you a shot.</i>

40:33.632 --> 40:34.831
To more fishing days to come.

40:34.933 --> 40:36.132
More fishing days to come.

40:37.202 --> 40:39.502
[josh] <i> it's not easy</i>
<i> to step into the unknown.</i>

40:39.504 --> 40:40.937
I can't leave him
down here, man.

40:41.006 --> 40:42.205
This is crazy.

40:42.941 --> 40:44.407
[josh] <i> but if you do...</i>

40:44.409 --> 40:46.843
One man that knows
if my old man
was down here fishing,

40:46.945 --> 40:48.745
<i> It's gonna be this guy.</i>

40:48.847 --> 40:50.647
<i> It's a road you don't have</i>
<i> to travel alone.</i>

40:51.817 --> 40:53.516
What can I help you guys with?

40:53.518 --> 40:55.518
How we doing today?

40:55.520 --> 40:57.720
You're the man that built
the cornelia marie are you?

41:04.362 --> 41:06.529
[casey speaking]

41:06.531 --> 41:07.330
No way.

41:08.333 --> 41:09.599
This is it, dude.

41:09.601 --> 41:11.601
Right down here
in venice louisiana.

41:11.603 --> 41:13.203
[man] <i> what the</i>  [bleep]
<i> we doing? Put it on.</i>

41:13.905 --> 41:15.338
Come on.

41:15.407 --> 41:18.641
I feel for your goals
with your father
and all of that,

41:18.743 --> 41:21.110
But you can't promise
something and not deliver.

41:21.112 --> 41:23.046
-[gunshot]
-[bleep]

41:23.147 --> 41:25.248
[man] <i> damn.</i>

41:25.317 --> 41:27.217
-[man] step down.
-[man] you got to risk it
for the biscuit baby.
