Who here saw an eight month pregnant lady on the stage?

01:45.000 --> 01:49.133
Uh... I saw a very constipated old man.

01:50.098 --> 01:52.848
It did look a bit like you needed a poo.

01:53.620 --> 01:55.520
Why do you think it looked that way?

01:56.871 --> 01:59.305
Well, it was just a bit too much.

02:01.283 --> 02:02.634
Yes Margaret.

02:03.927 --> 02:05.750
I think it's harder for him.

02:06.525 --> 02:08.024
Why do you think it's harder for him?

02:09.544 --> 02:11.066
Because he's a man.

02:12.640 --> 02:15.000
Why would it be harder because he's a man?

02:15.868 --> 02:19.480
Well, we see a man on stage

02:19.480 --> 02:24.160
and so it's harder for us to see him as a pregnant lady.

02:24.160 --> 02:27.366
OK, forget the lady part. Did he look pregnant?

02:27.366 --> 02:29.366
But he can't get pregnant.

02:29.607 --> 02:33.300
That's not the point. Everyone here has done this exercise

02:33.300 --> 02:36.469
and a lot of you haven't been pregnant.

02:36.469 --> 02:40.370
In fact Sue can't have children can you Sue? No.

02:40.800 --> 02:46.317
The point is, when you play a character it shouldn't matter
that you share nothing in common with that character.

02:47.045 --> 02:51.617
None of us are serial killers but to play one you have to become one,

02:51.617 --> 02:54.072
you have to think like one, you have to

02:54.072 --> 02:57.353
find the desire to kill and the belief that you have killed.

02:58.366 --> 03:01.789
If you don't believe you're a serial killer neither will the audience.

03:02.464 --> 03:05.458
I mean obviously you're not going to actually kill anyone

03:05.458 --> 03:11.621
and obviously a man can't get pregnant
but an actor can believe they're pregnant.

03:13.358 --> 03:18.720
Did you believe you were pregnant?
Did you truly feel a child kicking in your stomach?

03:18.720 --> 03:27.074
Well I tried, but I couldn't manage it.
I think maybe I was doing the physical actions

03:27.074 --> 03:30.982
instead of letting the belief that I was pregnant give me the attributes,

03:30.982 --> 03:34.255
or the the physical attributes, of actually being pregnant.

03:34.255 --> 03:39.049
Exactly! It was a good try though. We're all still learning.

03:39.724 --> 03:43.123
I'm not picking on him Margaret, these exercises are difficult.

03:44.040 --> 03:47.658
But I truly think that he could make us believe he's a pregnant lady

03:47.658 --> 03:49.368
if he believes it himself.

03:50.091 --> 03:55.554

looked about 50, permanently whacked out on glue.

One night, for no other reason other than we could,
a couple of us raped her with a wine bottle.

11:18.012 --> 11:21.885
You didn't worry about being alive, you just lived. Moment by moment.

11:21.885 --> 11:31.605
Sure, you could be unhappy one moment but it didn't plague you.
You just instinctively let that shit go and got on with having fun.

Shit just couldn't stick.

11:36.608 --> 11:44.960

There was no malice. No aggression.
Just a big beaming smile and delicious rosy cheeks.

It wasn't a face that you could say fuck off to,
so instead I just asked if she wanted to join me for a drink.

She said no.

16:41.429 --> 16:42.277

We got the same bus and we decided to go for a coffee together.

17:05.901 --> 17:14.267
We shared so much in common and it was the first time
I felt really comfortable with a girl. I mean,

17:14.267 --> 17:19.484
I don't really have female friends. They make me a bit nervous.

17:20.691 --> 17:21.653
Nervous?

17:23.535 --> 17:24.529
Yeah.

17:26.314 --> 17:28.314
I mean... not nervous but...

17:28.314 --> 17:33.286
we obviously share more things in common with those
of the same sex

17:33.286 --> 17:38.257
and I just like hanging around people with the same interests as me.

17:38.257 --> 17:44.660
So I've never really had any use for female friends
and I've always been wary of men that have, you know?

17:46.059 --> 17:49.132
Why do they have so much in common with women? I mean...

17:49.132 --> 18:00.077

Just seems a bit weird to me.

18:02.779 --> 18:04.768
They're obviously perverts.

18:04.768 --> 18:05.803

18:10.360 --> 18:12.026
I didn't know it was a crime to be bullied.

18:12.026 --> 18:18.115
No it's not, but then again most of the kids that
were bullied at school were bullied for a reason.

18:19.128 --> 18:20.595
They were a bit weird.

18:21.995 --> 18:30.400
I mean, when I think back to my school, all the kids that were bullied,
they were kiddie fiddlers in the making.

18:30.400 --> 18:33.653
That's a bit harsh! I was bullied at school.

You know, probably wrong place wrong time.

18:41.508 --> 18:47.038
But if you think about it, most kids that were bullied were just a bit weird.

18:48.437 --> 18:49.819
...covered in jizzum

18:54.907 --> 18:59.078
I was bullied at school. I didn't deserve it.

19:00.000 --> 19:06.632
I was a rather talented girl but nonetheless
I pretty much enjoyed all the same things all the other girls liked.

19:06.632 --> 19:11.247
And I did my best not to stick out, you know, in spite of my talents,

19:12.453 --> 19:15.659
but a group of girls just took a dislike to me.

19:15.659 --> 19:17.659
I don't know why.

19:17.659 --> 19:19.659
Probably jealous.

19:19.659 --> 19:21.659
They made my life hell.

19:23.444 --> 19:24.720
I don't dwell on it.

19:25.396 --> 19:30.918
I know it certainly wasn't my fault and there was nothing
I could do about it, it was just one of those things.

19:32.124 --> 19:33.654
It hasn't done me any harm.

19:35.654 --> 19:41.280
Anyway, what do you think of this barman?
Quite charming isn't he?

19:42.099 --> 19:45.000
If he buys me one more drink...

19:45.000 --> 19:47.035
I'll let him fuck me up the arse.

19:48.531 --> 19:52.282
Single or double?
Double

19:53.826 --> 19:58.264
And then it hit me. This is actually what love is.

19:58.264 --> 20:06.628
Finding a female who can be your best friend and they have lived
in their own female world and yet they share your feelings and your thoughts

20:07.738 --> 20:13.565
and it's like you're the same person and bam! I was in love.

20:13.565 --> 20:16.814
We hardly spent a day apart from each other after that day.

20:16.814 --> 20:19.040
So that was your moment?

20:19.040 --> 20:20.181
Yeah

20:21.194 --> 20:24.095
But like all moments it didn't last?

20:24.095 --> 20:25.328
Yeah

20:26.100 --> 20:27.410
What happened to her?

20:27.410 --> 20:28.976
We just got bored.

20:28.976 --> 20:30.198
Bored?

20:30.198 --> 20:35.337
Yeah, our moment had passed and we just went back to the mundane.

No don't say that.

What's a BJ?

24:41.192 --> 24:44.940
Yeah Becky, what's a BJ? Why don't you tell him what a BJ is?

24:44.940 --> 24:48.158
It's just a kiss on the cheek.
Tell him we'll both give him a kiss on the cheek.

What am I trying to do John?

25:01.892 --> 25:03.771
You think you're so fucking clever but you're not.

25:03.771 --> 25:05.863
I'm not following you.

25:05.863 --> 25:10.692
You're trying to make me feel like everyone else.
Like I'm not fucked up.

25:10.692 --> 25:17.262
You put on your smart middle-class clothes,
brush your hair all neat and tidy, make yourself all respectable.

25:17.262 --> 25:23.731
I'm not buying it. You talk in your nice voice,
in your respectable clothes and it's bullshit.

25:23.731 --> 25:29.328
You know, when I come in here, one of the first things
you tell me is how you raped a homeless woman with a bottle.

25:29.328 --> 25:34.239
Trying to make out that I'm not sick and that we all think this stuff.

25:34.239 --> 25:39.315
That you are like me. I'm not buying it.

25:40.797 --> 25:45.222
The dead brother, the girlfriend you got bored of, it fits together all too nicely.

25:45.222 --> 25:52.044
You want me to talk to you so you want me
to think I'm just like you, but I'm not.

25:52.044 --> 26:01.399
You expect me to see someone like you looking all respectable,
but really you're as fucked up as me?

26:01.399 --> 26:06.877
But you're not like me and this is just bollocks.

26:06.877 --> 26:15.826
Am I supposed to believe that everyone is like me
but they just carrying on pretending everything's just dandy?

26:19.927 --> 26:22.760
Obviously I want you to talk, John.

26:22.760 --> 26:29.752
If you want someone to open up to you then you've got to create
a connection with them. That's simple psychology.

26:29.752 --> 26:33.141
So everything you said is bollocks?

26:33.141 --> 26:38.764
No, I'm just purposefully selecting things
that I think that you'll empathise with.

26:39.680 --> 26:42.989
So you're a rapist who can't connect with women?

26:43.616 --> 26:48.823
No. I used to be a rapist that can't connect with women.

26:49.836 --> 26:52.121
You've never been like me.

26:52.121 --> 26:56.592
You've never been like me. You know when you said about the
homeless woman that you raped with a bottle, do you know what I felt?

26:56.592 --> 26:57.355
What?

26:57.355 --> 27:05.436
Excited. Fucking excited. That's the kind of shit I think about
all the time and I mean all the fucking time.

27:05.436 --> 27:10.153
There's lots of people out there like me are there? I don't fucking think so.

27:10.153 --> 27:12.549
You don't know shit Carl.

27:12.549 --> 27:17.604
If you knew what was happening to me you'd
encourage me to kill myself, I am a fucking monster.

27:20.064 --> 27:26.011
You're right John, I don't know what's going on in your head,
so why don't you tell me?

27:27.893 --> 27:36.443
Bored, perverted, psychotic, neurotic, schizophrenic, addictive,
angry, lonely, I am all of these things and more.

27:36.443 --> 27:41.354
Which would be fine if I could enjoy being in any of these states, but I can't.

27:41.354 --> 27:48.947
I would much rather be one of those serial killers you read about,
at least they seem to get a fucking kick out of the things they think.

27:50.587 --> 28:02.899
But I'm not so lucky. I'd just rather be dead, so fuck you and your
bullshit stories, you can't help me. Your little word games aren't gonna work.

28:03.912 --> 28:08.670
I'm afraid you've made a mistake, this is one person you can't help.

28:12.771 --> 28:16.697
Everything I've told you, you've asked me to tell you.

28:16.697 --> 28:24.246
I said I've done some terrible things and you asked me
what kind of things so I told you about the homeless woman.

28:26.369 --> 28:35.480
I said I've had moments and you asked me what kind of moments
so I very kindly told you about Julia.

28:36.879 --> 28:42.423
Now you seem to think that I'm purposely lying to you
and trying to hide things from you.

28:43.484 --> 28:47.279
I said that I met a woman and that we fell in love.

28:48.533 --> 28:55.768
I then said that we got bored of each other and we split up.
It's not an unusual story. Every other person you meet will tell you the same one.

28:55.768 --> 29:00.428
Yet you chose not to believe me, which is fine.

29:00.428 --> 29:07.717
Now, it's up to you if you want to believe everything that I'm saying to you,
but I can assure you I'm not playing any games.

29:07.717 --> 29:16.283
If you don't want to hear anything about my life, that's absolutely fine
but if that is the case then don't ask me about my life.

29:16.283 --> 29:23.718

I think I got angry at the Julia story.

33:42.666 --> 33:54.425
I got jealous. You see, I couldn't have that connection you two had.
I've never had it with anyone. I'm incapable of it.

33:55.872 --> 34:05.530
That's something you can do and I can't and
no matter how fucked up you've been you've still had that.

34:08.811 --> 34:09.719

If you want to say something, just say it.

Mr. Furrington?

34:41.806 --> 34:43.043

Is that difficult to pronounce?

34:45.472 --> 34:47.472
No.

34:47.472 --> 34:55.556
In which case I can only presume that what you called him
today was a purposeful insult. What did you call him today?

34:56.666 --> 34:57.613
I don't know.

34:57.613 --> 35:02.392
I suggest you tell me or I am going to double your lashes.

35:07.102 --> 35:13.360

35:14.710 --> 35:17.115
Mr. Fucking Bum.

35:21.457 --> 35:24.820
The trouble is, Carl, that you lack character.

35:26.170 --> 35:32.557
You think it's funny to swear in front of your teachers
and you're proud of yourself when the other boys laugh.

35:33.811 --> 35:40.622
But they are only laughing at you.
They are laughing because they know better than to do it themselves.

35:40.622 --> 35:49.080
They are encouraging the weak to misbehave for their own amusement.
They want to see you get into trouble.

35:50.865 --> 35:56.456
And what reward do they give you?
Nothing but their pathetic giggles.

35:58.386 --> 36:01.817
And that is all the reward that this pathetic boy needs.

36:04.374 --> 36:10.975
Your brother Michael has always been at the top of his class.
He has always excelled, do you know why?

36:10.975 --> 36:17.712
Because he does not allow himself to be manipulated
by those with less character than himself.

36:19.594 --> 36:21.757
You need more strength of character.

36:23.542 --> 36:29.788
However, I will do you a favour.
I will give you an exercise in strength of character.

36:31.332 --> 36:37.974
I will give you the chance to have just the three
original lashes I offered you before you lied to me.

36:40.242 --> 36:46.267
If you do not flinch when I raise the ruler,
then three lashes is all you will get.

36:46.267 --> 36:54.672
If you flinch I will double it back to six,
does that sound fair?

36:54.672 --> 36:56.639
Yes, Sir.

Now keep your hands still and look me in the eye.

37:52.553 --> 37:55.205

37:55.205 --> 37:56.393
Yeah.

so why would you want to hear any more?

38:08.716 --> 38:12.379
Don't worry. Like I said, I'm not easily offended.

38:13.585 --> 38:17.515
What was your brother like? You know, the one who died?

38:17.515 --> 38:22.069
I could tell you but for all you know it might just be bullshit

38:22.069 --> 38:23.105

But it's that hardcore nasty shit that turns you on.
Well it's...

48:00.638 --> 48:05.461
Same for all of us. Look at the porn sites that you see
on the internet.

48:05.461 --> 48:08.952
It's damaged people being damaged by damaged people.

48:08.952 --> 48:10.952
What?

48:10.952 --> 48:17.246
Think about the sites that you see on the internet.
It's not all beautiful girls in lingerie now is it?

48:17.246 --> 48:26.432
There are millions of sites out there and they all advertise
with the words 'bitch' or 'whore' or 'slut' or 'slag'.

48:26.432 --> 48:31.479
If you look hard enough they'll probably be a site out
there called "The Bitch Whore Slut Slags".

48:31.479 --> 48:37.403
None of these sites are about making love to beautiful women.

48:37.403 --> 48:42.044
They're not even about fucking them.
They're about pain.

48:42.044 --> 48:48.225
They're about damaging people, degrading them
and leaving them used and abused.

48:48.225 --> 48:56.601
And these sites relish that fact. They know what we want.
They advertise the fact that they exploit people.

48:58.193 --> 49:00.184
How is this supposed to help me?

49:38.663 --> 49:44.861
Millions of men are logging onto sites to
see women being hurt and degraded.

49:44.861 --> 49:49.190
Every one of these sites has women being fucked
in the arse and why do we want to see that?

49:49.190 --> 49:52.437
Because we want to see the girl hurt.

49:52.437 --> 49:59.553
Any soft-headed small-dicked bastard who tells you
"it's the extra grip" thing, they're just talking shit.

49:59.553 --> 50:05.813
We know it's uncomfortable to have something shoved up
your arse and we want to see the girl uncomfortable.

50:05.813 --> 50:09.194
And all the men always have huge cocks.

50:11.510 --> 50:18.635
Is that for the lady's extra pleasure?
No. It's for the lady's extra discomfort.

50:18.635 --> 50:23.554
The larger the object shoved up an arse, the more painful it is.

50:23.554 --> 50:35.351
Fisting! Also popular wanking material. We want to see men sticking
their fists into women because that looks really fucking painful.

50:35.351 --> 50:42.714
We want to see women covered in spunk, in their faces,
on their lips and preferably in their eyes.

50:42.714 --> 50:48.344
We want them to be uncomfortable, to look a mess
and to be as degraded as possible.

50:48.344 --> 50:57.595
And that's why there are websites dedicated to women fucking animals.
Because let's face it, what's more degrading than fucking a pig?

50:57.595 --> 51:05.762
Oh let's have a wank over this poor girl.
A poor girl fucking a horse, even better!

51:05.762 --> 51:13.982

but an animal with a really big fucking dick.

1:00:54.089 --> 1:00:56.089
Why are you here?

1:00:56.089 --> 1:00:58.308
Because I read your advert.

1:00:58.308 --> 1:01:03.874
OK and what was it about the advert that captured your attention?

1:01:05.659 --> 1:01:11.462
It described a lot of things that I've been feeling.
It said you'd be able to help me.

1:01:11.462 --> 1:01:13.403
How did you think I was gonna do that?

1:01:13.403 --> 1:01:15.644
Because it fucking said you'd be able to help me.

1:01:15.644 --> 1:01:19.126
The ad guaranteed you'd be able to help me, and that's why I'm here.

1:01:19.126 --> 1:01:23.370
That's right it did, but how did you think I was gonna manage that?

1:01:23.370 --> 1:01:28.330
Well I don't know. I thought maybe you'd talk to me
and try and persuade me not to kill myself.

1:01:28.330 --> 1:01:35.727
Why would I persuade you not to kill yourself
if all that you think you're gonna feel is nothing but misery?

1:01:35.727 --> 1:01:39.000
Maybe killing yourself would be a good idea.

1:01:39.000 --> 1:01:45.843
I dunno. Yeah, maybe it is, but what is your point?

1:01:45.843 --> 1:01:52.472
The point is I think you can have fun. I think you can feel more.

1:01:52.472 --> 1:01:58.677
And I think that deep down you feel that you can feel more
and that's why you haven't killed yourself.

1:01:58.677 --> 1:02:01.710
But how can I feel more?

1:02:01.710 --> 1:02:04.706
By enjoying the feelings that you have already.

1:02:04.706 --> 1:02:06.253
What are you saying?

1:02:06.253 --> 1:02:10.662
Your dark thoughts. You need to learn to enjoy them.

Not everybody wants to become a parent,
not everybody wants to throw themselves off a mountain.

1:02:15.968 --> 1:02:24.087

and that's OK. That's their way of getting through this life

1:16:53.025 --> 1:16:54.174

1:16:57.666 --> 1:17:04.839
What is the difference between fantasising about something and doing it,
except for the fact that one's real and the other isn't?

1:17:04.839 --> 1:17:07.646
Nobody gets hurt in a fantasy.

1:17:07.646 --> 1:17:09.809

1:17:09.809 --> 1:17:11.160
What?

1:17:11.160 --> 1:17:19.818
For a fantasy to work, you have to believe that it's actually real.
You don't get turned on by the concept of something,
you have to believe it's actually happening.

1:17:19.818 --> 1:17:27.523

need to know that the woman on the other end is who she says she is

1:17:30.000 --> 1:17:34.843

then you don't get turned on by it.

1:30:54.485 --> 1:31:00.994
Mmm... actually, I'm surprised you're still conscious,
you really should have collapsed by now.

1:31:00.994 --> 1:31:02.715
What do you mean?

1:31:02.715 --> 1:31:09.460
Well John went bang on cue out in the corridor, so I was actually
expecting you to be unconscious when I came back in.

1:31:09.460 --> 1:31:13.282
I'm not following.

1:31:13.282 --> 1:31:21.126
Well, see... normally the poison in the wine
would have taken effect by now

1:31:21.126 --> 1:31:25.794
and you would be unconscious or dead like John is.

1:31:27.193 --> 1:31:28.455
John's dead?

1:31:28.455 --> 1:31:30.733
Yeah.

1:31:31.553 --> 1:31:38.693
He started finding it hard to breathe, so I gave him a bottle of water.
He took a glug and he keeled right over.

1:31:38.693 --> 1:31:47.567
I then put an empty jar of sleeping pills in his hand because the swig of
water he took was the equivalent to a month's supply of those pills.

1:31:47.567 --> 1:31:49.887
They'll just assume he died of an overdose.

1:31:49.887 --> 1:31:51.478
Suicide.

1:31:51.478 --> 1:31:54.064
Which will make perfect sense once they've seen the tape.

1:31:54.064 --> 1:31:58.268
Why?

1:31:58.268 --> 1:32:00.302
Tape?

1:32:00.302 --> 1:32:02.680
Yeah the tape.

1:32:02.680 --> 1:32:07.815
The whole thing's been recorded. Look, there's the camera.

Once I've edited the tape, it will show John
shooting you and leaving with me.

1:32:25.166 --> 1:32:31.540
Then the tape will run out, so they won't see you getting up

1:32:31.540 --> 1:32:36.583
and they won't see me coming back in and shooting you.

1:32:41.118 --> 1:32:42.876
The first bullet was a blank.

1:32:42.876 --> 1:32:45.412
But the next one is real.

1:32:45.412 --> 1:32:52.299
It's a shame, really, that I can't just have them both be real
and let the men shoot each other in the grapple but...

1:32:52.299 --> 1:32:56.833
I can't trust men with real bullets can I?

1:32:56.833 --> 1:32:59.909
Not when they've got the gun to my head, right?

1:33:09.896 --> 1:33:11.947
I'm going to shoot you now

1:33:11.947 --> 1:33:19.276
but it will speed up your death a bit and you're probably
in quite some discomfort aren't you? So the quicker the better.

He joined the class a couple of weeks ago.
