06:33.927 --> 06:35.927
                Nostradamus.
               Oh.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.829
             He used to tell me
            many exciting things

06:37.865 --> 06:38.896
          that came true.

06:38.932 --> 06:39.997
     Well, they don't make them

06:40.033 --> 06:41.165
         that way anymore,
              Jeannie.

06:41.201 --> 06:42.467
                  All right,
             we better be going.

06:42.503 --> 06:44.002
                    I'll--
             I'll be home early.

06:44.037 --> 06:46.204
Oh-ho. I wouldn't be
too sure of that.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.709
         You may get
   so fascinated with her,

06:50.744 --> 06:51.810
    you won't want to leave.

06:51.845 --> 06:53.778
           Well, I hardly
          think so, Roger.

06:53.814 --> 06:55.646
      Good night, Jeannie.
Good night, master.

06:55.682 --> 06:56.781
       I will wait up for you.

07:00.386 --> 07:02.320
                      [SIGHS]

07:15.501 --> 07:17.936
Say, have you heard anything
about NASA expanding

07:17.971 --> 07:19.738
and buying more property
around the base?

07:19.773 --> 07:21.706
              No. No. Isn't this
                your apartment?

07:21.742 --> 07:24.008
Yeah, Madame Zolta
lives right next door to me.

07:24.044 --> 07:26.010
       Oh, that's a coincidence,
               isn't it?

07:26.046 --> 07:28.179
Boy, you sure
are suspicious, aren't you?

07:32.252 --> 07:33.618
         Come in,
       Major Healey.

07:33.653 --> 07:34.652
            Hello, Madame Zolta.

07:34.688 --> 07:35.953
     I'd like you
  to meet a friend--

07:35.989 --> 07:37.622
          Major Nelson.

07:37.657 --> 07:39.391
Hey, she knows who you are.
            Sit down.

07:39.426 --> 07:40.558
Thank you.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.961
        Ahem, I-- I hope
   I'm not intruding, madam.

07:43.997 --> 07:45.897
              Oh, but you're not
               intruding, major.

07:45.932 --> 07:46.964
            I was expecting you.

07:47.000 --> 07:48.165
And when Madame
Zolta says

07:48.201 --> 07:49.567
she's expecting you,
she--

07:49.603 --> 07:51.669
Oh, how about that?
Three cups.

07:53.507 --> 07:54.839
                      Major.
Thank you.

07:54.875 --> 07:57.142
         And you take cream

07:57.177 --> 07:58.609
           and one sugar.

07:59.612 --> 08:00.578
Hey, how about that?

08:00.613 --> 08:02.247
Do you see what I mean?
She knows.

08:02.282 --> 08:03.314
              Remarkable, Roger.

08:03.350 --> 08:06.817
                 Major Nelson...
                  is a skeptic.

08:06.853 --> 08:08.018
No, no, no.
That's not true.

08:08.054 --> 08:09.487
He just came over here
to meet you.

08:09.523 --> 08:12.457
   He came because he does not
          believe in me,

08:12.492 --> 08:13.991
 and he was worried about you.

08:14.994 --> 08:17.662
   Now, is that not true, major?

08:17.698 --> 08:20.364
            Well, let's say
       I came with an open mind.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.465
         You are a Leo.

08:21.501 --> 08:23.902
Hey, that's right.
How about that?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.537
          I'm sure Madame Zolta
        reads newspapers, Roger.

08:26.573 --> 08:30.342
You have a very inquiring mind.

08:30.377 --> 08:32.876
        You want to know
        why things happen.

08:32.913 --> 08:34.645
That's true.
That-- That's true.

08:34.681 --> 08:36.347
             That's also true
          of millions of people.

08:36.383 --> 08:38.482
      And you are very stubborn.

08:38.518 --> 08:41.152
         Once you are interested
              in a problem,

08:41.187 --> 08:44.489
      you will not let go
  until you have all the facts.

08:44.524 --> 08:46.991
Oh, boy, has she got
you down pat.

08:47.026 --> 08:48.225
                 I have prepared

08:48.261 --> 08:51.562
               your astrological
                 chart for you.

08:51.598 --> 08:53.164
                     I hope
                you do not mind.

08:53.199 --> 08:54.198
                      No.

08:54.233 --> 08:55.633
                 Not if it's not
                  too expensive.

08:55.669 --> 08:57.134
      There is no charge.

08:58.237 --> 08:59.637
                      No?

08:59.673 --> 09:02.840
   Well, I understand these take
    quite some time to prepare.

09:02.875 --> 09:04.075
         Doesn't matter.

09:05.412 --> 09:06.811
       I did it because...

09:06.846 --> 09:10.881
        I am very interested
              in you.

09:10.917 --> 09:13.050
             How did you know
         you were gonna meet me?

09:14.621 --> 09:18.022
         Perhaps I read it
         in the newspaper.

09:19.693 --> 09:20.658
Touché, Tony.

09:20.694 --> 09:22.660
    May I see your hand, please?

09:22.696 --> 09:23.661
                Which one?

09:23.696 --> 09:25.896
  The one with the scar on it...

09:26.633 --> 09:27.798
      ...that you got climbing

09:27.834 --> 09:30.234
       over your neighbor's
        barbed-wire fence.

09:32.405 --> 09:33.604
          The right one.

09:33.640 --> 09:35.673
You didn't tell me
about that.

09:35.708 --> 09:37.575
       Well, it happened
    when I was 7 years old.

09:37.610 --> 09:39.677
I suppose she read
about that in the newspapers.

09:43.783 --> 09:44.782
                 Let us see what

09:44.817 --> 09:46.384
                the crystal ball
                   has to say.

09:46.420 --> 09:47.485
             Oh, come on.
               Come on.

09:47.521 --> 09:48.719
                Oh, you won't
                believe this.

09:48.755 --> 09:49.754
            This is really
                good.

09:49.789 --> 09:52.557
               Uh, Madame Zolta.
                I'm afraid you--

09:52.592 --> 09:54.325
             You're just wasting
                  your time.

09:54.361 --> 09:55.927
                My, uh, friend
             Major Healey may be

09:55.962 --> 09:57.428
          a little more gullible
                than I am.

09:57.464 --> 09:58.930
           I've had a little
            more experience.

09:58.965 --> 10:01.399
        And if there's one thing
        I'm sure of, it's that--

10:03.536 --> 10:04.535
            That's me.

10:05.238 --> 10:06.504
            Yes.

10:06.539 --> 10:08.639
The crystal ball holds the past,

10:08.675 --> 10:11.208
  the present and the future.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.478
              Yeah-- Hey, Roger,
               that's really me.

10:13.513 --> 10:14.645
        Don't touch it.

10:15.682 --> 10:19.550
          You will...
      disturb the spirits.

10:19.586 --> 10:20.718
                      Oh, sorry.

10:25.024 --> 10:26.791
Now do you
believe me?

10:26.827 --> 10:28.259
   I-- I'm sorry, Madam, I--

10:28.294 --> 10:30.261
                  I-I must admit
                 I was skeptical

10:30.296 --> 10:31.495
                    when I first
                   came in here,

10:31.531 --> 10:33.398
           but that--
     That's really amazing.

10:33.433 --> 10:36.000
    Do not apologize, major.

10:36.036 --> 10:38.803
         I have converted
         many unbelievers.

10:38.839 --> 10:41.072
    I'd certainly like to know
      a lot more about this.

10:41.942 --> 10:42.907
      I'm holding a séance

10:42.943 --> 10:45.143
         tomorrow night.

10:45.178 --> 10:47.845
        If you care to attend,
        you are very welcome.

10:47.881 --> 10:49.814
           Oh, I'd--
    I'd like that very much.

10:49.849 --> 10:52.250
         Can you, uh...?
   Can you contact the spirits?

10:53.820 --> 10:55.686
     If the atmosphere is right.

10:56.456 --> 10:58.156
         Well...I, um--

10:58.191 --> 11:00.157
       I have an aunt and uncle
       I lost a few years ago.

11:00.193 --> 11:01.992
              I'd very much like
               to speak to them.

11:03.262 --> 11:04.796
     Uncle Jeff and Aunt Susan.

11:06.499 --> 11:08.433
 We will do what we can, major.

11:08.468 --> 11:09.533
               Thank you.

11:09.569 --> 11:11.903
            Now if--
      If you'll excuse me.

11:11.938 --> 11:13.805
             I'm--
       I'm rather tired.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.940
                   Oh, yes, yes,
                     certainly.

11:15.976 --> 11:17.075
      I must say,
         I'm--

11:18.211 --> 11:19.944
 I-I'm terribly impressed.

11:19.980 --> 11:22.914
      I think that you will find
          the séance tomorrow

11:22.949 --> 11:24.716
           much more impressive.

11:24.751 --> 11:25.717
               Good night.

11:25.752 --> 11:26.818
      Good night.
      Good night.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.520
                      Roger...

11:34.026 --> 11:35.392
       Uh, good night.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.594
     Good night.
                Good night.

11:36.629 --> 11:38.629
   S-s-see you tomorrow tonight.
                  Thanks again.

11:46.840 --> 11:47.872
        Hakim.

11:48.909 --> 11:50.675
     It was easy.

11:50.710 --> 11:52.343
You really think
you'll be able to talk

11:52.378 --> 11:53.711
to your Uncle Jeff
and Aunt Sue?

11:53.746 --> 11:54.779
                    Oh, it's
                 a possibility.

11:54.815 --> 11:56.447
If anybody can do it,
Madame Zolta can.

11:56.482 --> 11:57.448
   She's great.

11:57.483 --> 11:58.616
                 She better be.

11:58.651 --> 12:00.351
      I don't have an Uncle Jeff
            or an Aunt Sue.

Oh, uh, hi, hi.
Jeannie--

12:17.938 --> 12:19.871
                  Yes, master.
Well, could you come over here?

12:19.906 --> 12:21.072
I need a little--

        Oh.

      Yeah.

12:24.677 --> 12:26.244
               Oh, master,
         do you mind if I use it

12:26.279 --> 12:28.146
                to look up
         some of my old friends?

12:28.181 --> 12:29.313
  Uh, uh, Jeannie, it's not--

12:29.349 --> 12:30.415
   It's not a telephone book.

12:30.450 --> 12:31.549
  It's just a piece of glass.

12:31.584 --> 12:32.983
            Ah. But you
              told me

12:33.019 --> 12:35.253
   that Madame Zolta made you
   appear in her crystal ball

12:35.288 --> 12:36.454
            as a small boy.

12:36.489 --> 12:38.056
     So I do not see any reason
           why I can't--

        Uh, yes, yes, I know.

12:39.225 --> 12:40.624
           But that's just
          a trick she does.

12:40.660 --> 12:42.327
     And I think I figured out
          how she does it.

12:42.362 --> 12:43.861
Now, ahem,
I need a--

12:43.897 --> 12:46.064
           A photograph
       of a man and a woman.

12:47.800 --> 12:48.800

what do I do first?
