00:38.612 --> 00:41.046
'Cause I want to find out
where we are, that's why!

00:41.047 --> 00:43.872
You're driving. You oughta
know where we are!

00:45.118 --> 00:46.976
Take a left.

00:48.622 --> 00:50.155
No, I said left!

00:50.156 --> 00:53.117
It's a desert, Leo.
What difference does it make?

01:04.738 --> 01:06.937
Just once, can't you do like I ask?

01:21.855 --> 01:24.418
Relax, we're losing 'em.

01:35.869 --> 01:38.296
Maybe they'll run out of gas.

01:39.773 --> 01:42.404
I wish you hadn't said that.

01:51.318 --> 01:54.143
I said left!

01:59.993 --> 02:03.128
Two hundred stinkin'
miles of stinkin' desert,

02:03.129 --> 02:05.731
and you gotta drive us into a
stinkin' pool of stinkin' water!

02:05.732 --> 02:09.399
What do you figure the
odds are on this?

02:32.025 --> 02:34.426
And I say they're bandits.

02:34.427 --> 02:37.229
Nah, they couldn't be.

02:37.230 --> 02:39.998
They would have killed us by now.

02:43.002 --> 02:46.202
- Oh, no.
- The General.

03:16.269 --> 03:18.804
Watch, he'll probably say
something stupid like,

03:18.805 --> 03:22.241
"So, gentlemen, we meet again."

03:22.242 --> 03:26.111
So, gentlemen, we meet again.

03:26.112 --> 03:27.413
See?

03:27.414 --> 03:29.114
You are responsible for this!

03:29.115 --> 03:31.083
Hey, I can't take all the credit.
I mean, Leo here, he...

03:31.084 --> 03:33.317
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

03:40.627 --> 03:42.826
Splendid!

03:48.067 --> 03:51.392
A moment frozen in time.

03:53.006 --> 03:56.375
It occurred to me that
to leave you gentlemen

03:56.376 --> 04:00.446
here in this wretched heat,
with nothing to drink,

04:00.447 --> 04:04.614
would be a cruel and merciless act.

04:05.318 --> 04:09.254
In three hours, your flesh
will begin to blister.

04:09.255 --> 04:11.790
Two hours later,
your tongues will swell.

04:11.791 --> 04:15.928
And all that time, you will
be holding the liquid of life

04:15.929 --> 04:18.720
in your very own hand.

04:18.865 --> 04:21.360
And you'll still be bald.

04:30.677 --> 04:35.345
Should you need anything,
gentlemen, just scream!

05:19.125 --> 05:22.361
Max, there's something
I want to tell you.

05:22.362 --> 05:23.762
What?

05:23.763 --> 05:26.463
I really want you to know...

05:26.666 --> 05:29.491
that I blame you for this.

05:36.509 --> 05:38.298
Oh, Max.

05:39.546 --> 05:40.612
Hurry up, Max.

05:40.613 --> 05:43.313
Something is crawling up my legs!

05:43.349 --> 05:46.947
Leo, there's only so much I can do!

05:58.998 --> 06:00.365
Quick!

06:00.366 --> 06:03.134
They're crawling all over me!

06:08.608 --> 06:10.275
Oh, quit bellyaching.

06:10.276 --> 06:12.441
I'm getting us out of it, aren't I?

06:15.081 --> 06:16.415
Got us into it, too.

06:16.416 --> 06:18.808
Geez.

06:22.255 --> 06:24.089
I'd like to see the look
on the General's face

06:24.090 --> 06:26.058
when he sees us gone.

06:26.059 --> 06:29.161
The only water we had,
and you had to break it.

06:29.162 --> 06:31.396
Geez, that's gratitude for ya.

06:31.397 --> 06:34.299
All I can think of is a
beer from Tubbs Bar.

06:34.300 --> 06:37.967
But that's in Arizona...
5,000 miles from here.

06:43.309 --> 06:45.410
Max, I'm quitting.

06:45.411 --> 06:46.845
Again?

06:46.846 --> 06:48.680
How many expeditions have
we been on together?

06:48.681 --> 06:51.183
- Hundreds.
- Fifteen.

06:51.184 --> 06:52.951
Fifteen, Max. In ten years.

06:52.952 --> 06:55.743
And how many have we made money on?

06:56.422 --> 06:58.957
Three, Max. Only three.

06:58.958 --> 07:01.126
That's not such a good average.

07:01.127 --> 07:03.328
- Our average income...
- Leo...

07:03.329 --> 07:05.426
you're being a teacher again.

07:05.765 --> 07:07.332
It's a side of you I've never liked.

07:07.333 --> 07:10.636
Max, we keep sticking our necks
out, and sooner or later,

07:10.637 --> 07:12.270
somebody's gonna chop our heads off.

07:12.271 --> 07:13.538
What'll it be, sister?

07:13.539 --> 07:16.642
May... may I have...
see your wine list, please?

07:16.643 --> 07:20.037
I got it memorized.
You want white or red?

07:21.280 --> 07:24.071
Red. Thank you.

07:25.752 --> 07:29.488
My sources inform me that this
place is frequented by men of...

07:29.489 --> 07:32.658
shall we say,
questionable character.

07:32.659 --> 07:35.393
- No, here?
- Yes.

07:35.528 --> 07:37.663
I need men of undying loyalty...

07:37.664 --> 07:41.092
brave, not too smart.

07:42.435 --> 07:45.470
Two men, end of the bar.

07:45.471 --> 07:48.205
Tell 'em I said you was okay.

07:56.082 --> 07:57.315
Come on, Leo.

07:57.316 --> 08:00.786
You don't want to go back to being
cooped up in a classroom again, do ya?

08:00.787 --> 08:04.852
The bartender says I'm okay.

08:09.529 --> 08:11.163
That's good enough for me.

08:11.164 --> 08:12.364
Good.

08:12.365 --> 08:14.792
This is gonna be
easier than I thought.

08:31.384 --> 08:34.619
- Hello, I'm Patricia Goodwin.
- Max Donigan, Leo Porter.

08:34.620 --> 08:36.443
Hello.

08:36.722 --> 08:39.890
Gentlemen, I have a business
proposition for you.

08:39.892 --> 08:41.760
But I must warn you,

08:41.760 --> 08:44.429
the men I hire need
to be very brave.

08:44.430 --> 08:45.530
Well, we...

08:45.531 --> 08:48.595
laugh in the face of
death, right, Leo?

08:49.235 --> 08:52.704
Now it won't be easy.
It might even be dangerous.

08:52.705 --> 08:55.774
But it could be worth
a lot of money.

08:55.775 --> 08:56.975
Money?

08:56.976 --> 08:59.437
Money.

09:01.347 --> 09:02.948
You see, I've recently
acquired a map,

09:02.949 --> 09:07.708
and I'm convinced it leads
to a great amount of gold.

09:09.756 --> 09:11.123
What's the location?

09:11.124 --> 09:14.159
An Indian reservation not far
from here near the border.

09:14.160 --> 09:18.096
Help me find the gold,
and we'll split it... 50/50.

09:18.097 --> 09:21.733
What makes you sure that that
map of yours is authentic?

09:21.734 --> 09:25.103
There must be gold there because
someone's willing to kill for it.

09:25.104 --> 09:27.166
And who might that be?

09:27.373 --> 09:30.004
I don't know, but
he's very dangerous.

09:30.143 --> 09:31.643
Well, there is one other thing,

09:31.644 --> 09:33.278
but you're probably
not gonna believe me.

09:33.279 --> 09:36.877
No, no, we'll believe it.

09:37.483 --> 09:41.553
The man who wants the map...
he isn't really a man.

09:41.554 --> 09:46.484
But he's... he looks like...

09:47.426 --> 09:48.493
a cyclops.

09:48.494 --> 09:51.596
- Cyclops?
- A red one.

09:51.597 --> 09:53.732
Red cyclops, man.

09:53.733 --> 09:56.501
With long black hair.

09:57.470 --> 10:00.806
See, I knew you wouldn't believe me.

10:00.807 --> 10:03.775
Oh, yeah, yeah... we believe you.

10:03.776 --> 10:05.777
It's just that...

10:05.778 --> 10:09.843
there are certain things
that are out of our league.

10:10.316 --> 10:13.285
Dragons and sea serpents.

10:13.286 --> 10:15.644
Red cyclops.

10:19.625 --> 10:22.794
Please, take a look at the map.

10:22.795 --> 10:25.028
You can see it's authentic.

10:33.506 --> 10:35.933
I'm telling you the truth.

10:38.110 --> 10:39.899
Keep your heads down!

10:40.713 --> 10:43.037
See, I told you so!

10:45.017 --> 10:47.842
This way! Come on!

10:49.121 --> 10:51.616
Come on, Patricia! Come on!

10:51.724 --> 10:53.821
Come on, Leo!

11:02.001 --> 11:03.602
So, we're anchored, see?

11:03.603 --> 11:06.504
It is so still...
I mean, not a ripple.

11:06.505 --> 11:08.874
It's so quiet, it's scary.

11:08.875 --> 11:11.176
All of a sudden, up comes
this gigantic wave,

11:11.177 --> 11:12.944
and we sink like a rock.

11:12.945 --> 11:15.213
Well, I start swimming
towards shore.

11:15.214 --> 11:18.049
All of a sudden,
something bumps my leg.

11:18.050 --> 11:20.185
- I think shark, right?
- Right.

11:20.186 --> 11:22.886
- You know what it was?
- Porpoise.

11:23.956 --> 11:27.525
Anyway, I grab his fin,
and the porpoise and I,

11:27.526 --> 11:29.394
we take off for shore.

11:29.395 --> 11:32.163
but there are no bears
in the Himalayas,

11:32.164 --> 11:33.999
so it must be Bigfoot.

11:34.000 --> 11:36.995
Well, I figure it's him or me.

11:37.203 --> 11:40.705
Now, a female lion...
she'll stalk you for days...

11:40.706 --> 11:42.939
Max?

11:45.878 --> 11:48.646
- We're here.
- Where?

11:48.881 --> 11:51.273
Up there.

11:55.488 --> 11:57.756
Yeah, it would be.

11:57.757 --> 12:01.059
If it's all the same to you,
I think I'll head back now.

12:01.060 --> 12:03.122
Afraid of a little climb?

12:03.296 --> 12:07.232
This is a sacred place.
You should not stay here.

12:07.233 --> 12:09.364
Vaya con dios.

12:10.236 --> 12:12.469
Hey, Max.

12:12.738 --> 12:14.562
Maybe he's right.

12:14.907 --> 12:16.441
You worry too much, Leo.

12:16.442 --> 12:18.334
Let's go.

13:02.288 --> 13:04.282
Give me your hand.

13:05.558 --> 13:07.620
Okay, honey.

13:07.927 --> 13:09.627
- Come on!
- I got it! I got it!

13:09.628 --> 13:12.293
I got it! I got it!

13:12.365 --> 13:14.291
I got it.

13:18.738 --> 13:19.871
Come on.

13:19.872 --> 13:21.940
There better be some gold up here.

13:21.941 --> 13:25.232
- Get your butt...
- I'm coming, I'm coming.

13:25.411 --> 13:28.338
- Don't let go.
- Come on!

13:32.985 --> 13:35.116
I can do it.

13:41.260 --> 13:43.755
There's no cave here.

13:43.896 --> 13:46.164
Hell, we made this
climb for nothing.

13:46.165 --> 13:49.000
No, it's here.

13:49.001 --> 13:50.927
Behind that tree.

14:04.950 --> 14:06.842
Wait!

14:07.053 --> 14:08.987
- We can't go in.
- Why not?

14:08.988 --> 14:10.922
There's someone in there.

14:10.923 --> 14:12.123
You saw something?

14:12.124 --> 14:18.419
No, but... I'm sure there's some
old people in there... sleeping.

14:21.300 --> 14:24.898
Well, we'll be real quiet.

14:33.012 --> 14:35.143
Wonder how far it goes.

14:38.851 --> 14:41.949
Hello!

14:42.755 --> 14:44.544
Hello!

14:51.864 --> 14:53.965
It's like a burial ground.

14:53.966 --> 14:55.700
Old people...

14:55.701 --> 14:58.401
sleeping.

15:10.549 --> 15:12.550
Well, it's a bust.

15:12.551 --> 15:14.285
Hey, Max, Patricia's gone.

15:14.286 --> 15:16.815
I swear I'm gonna get a
leash for that woman.

15:16.889 --> 15:19.020
Patricia!

15:21.727 --> 15:24.791
Hey, you guys, I'm in here!

15:31.770 --> 15:34.060
Welcome, gentlemen.

15:37.643 --> 15:39.774
I really don't believe this.

15:40.079 --> 15:42.506
Hey, what's this?

15:44.016 --> 15:47.719
Wow... Aztec, Mayan...

15:47.720 --> 15:49.354
There's a date...

15:49.355 --> 15:51.623
1527, but it doesn't make any sense.

15:51.624 --> 15:53.024
What about this?

15:53.025 --> 15:57.124
Oh, that's 16th century.
Spanish conquistador.

15:57.596 --> 16:01.661
How about you, pal?
Can you tell us anything?

16:03.602 --> 16:05.926
Nope, I didn't think so.

16:14.947 --> 16:17.078
Look what I found.

16:17.149 --> 16:19.814
I knew it! I knew
we'd find something!

16:21.187 --> 16:24.148
Oh, man, that's the real deal.
Look at that.

16:24.690 --> 16:26.787
It's beautiful.

16:28.894 --> 16:30.895
But it's not the gold
we were looking for.

16:30.896 --> 16:32.130
Don't be so pessimistic.

16:32.131 --> 16:33.498
It's a hell of a start, though.

16:33.499 --> 16:35.133
I don't understand it.

16:35.134 --> 16:37.202
I'm so sure...

16:37.203 --> 16:40.130
I'm gonna keep looking, you guys.

16:44.877 --> 16:47.042
Wait, wait, wait!

16:48.247 --> 16:51.379
"A moment frozen in time."

17:11.369 --> 17:13.467
What is that?

17:14.240 --> 17:17.304
- How the hell should I know?
- Shoot him.

17:20.179 --> 17:21.968
Shoot it!

17:26.385 --> 17:29.621
Damn... you know, you are the
worst shot I have ever seen.

17:29.622 --> 17:32.652
Hell, I could have hit
him from there, too.

17:36.495 --> 17:38.319
Cover!

17:42.735 --> 17:44.695
He's got us pinned down.

17:49.742 --> 17:51.736
I don't think there's
any more of 'em.

17:58.083 --> 18:00.373
Lucky you're into knives.

18:07.660 --> 18:09.827
One shot left.

18:09.828 --> 18:12.926
- Oh, maybe you'd better let me do it.
- No, I can do it.

18:32.084 --> 18:34.283
Nice shot.

18:52.037 --> 18:53.861
Come on!

19:20.032 --> 19:22.459
Drop the knife.

19:24.002 --> 19:26.770
Step away from the girl.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.885
Geez, I didn't tell him to jump.

19:40.886 --> 19:44.622
Both... this is Aztec,
and here's the Mayan Sun God.

19:44.623 --> 19:47.323
And he appears again
on the dagger, see?

19:47.426 --> 19:52.330
Now, these hieroglyphics,
they give us the date 1527.

19:52.331 --> 19:53.831
Aztecs...

19:53.832 --> 19:55.466
Mayans...

19:55.467 --> 19:57.034
Spaniards...

19:57.035 --> 19:58.836
all on an Indian reservation.

19:58.837 --> 20:01.005
It doesn't jive.

20:01.006 --> 20:03.441
- El coyote.
- Who?

20:03.442 --> 20:05.610
There is an Indian
on the reservation

20:05.611 --> 20:08.813
who claims to be descended
from an Aztec priest,

20:08.814 --> 20:10.915
but he's a very dangerous man.

20:10.916 --> 20:13.451
Even to his people,
he's bad medicine.

20:13.452 --> 20:17.188
However, there is another
that might be of help.

20:17.189 --> 20:18.256
Who's that?

20:18.257 --> 20:21.759
If only I could remember his name.

20:21.760 --> 20:24.858
Might as well take it all.
It'll solve a lot of time.

20:36.975 --> 20:40.744
He's an old shaman named Tall Eagle.

20:52.591 --> 20:55.593
Honey. I'll meet you down
at the television studio.

20:55.594 --> 20:58.696
Oh, no. Now wait for me,
honey. I'm going with you.

20:58.697 --> 21:01.590
Now you just wait.

21:02.835 --> 21:07.196
- Lucy, isn't that the...
- Yes, it is.

21:07.606 --> 21:11.609
I got to thinking it was silly for
both of us to take our dresses back.

21:11.610 --> 21:13.544
As long as Ethel was
taking hers back.

21:13.545 --> 21:16.280
There was no reason for
me to take mine back.

21:16.281 --> 21:18.382
- Tall Eagle?
- I didn't say a word.

21:18.383 --> 21:21.811
I'll go get Mrs. Trumbull
to stay with Little Ricky.

21:22.221 --> 21:24.222
- Ricky?
- What?

21:24.223 --> 21:27.291
- I don't know why he puts up with her.
- Do you think Ethel will be mad at me?

21:27.292 --> 21:30.862
I wouldn't be surprised if she
punched you right in the nose.

21:30.863 --> 21:34.097
If she were mine,
I'd cut off her nose.

21:34.800 --> 21:38.228
- This is for you.
- For me?

21:41.039 --> 21:44.933
Snake bite. We have
lots of those around.

21:45.277 --> 21:47.278
When white men bring gifts,

21:47.279 --> 21:50.515
it means they want
something in return.

21:50.516 --> 21:52.613
You got that right, brother.

21:53.418 --> 21:56.187
They say that you know a
lot about Apache history.

21:56.188 --> 21:58.389
You want me to tell stories.

21:58.390 --> 21:59.991
That's what I do best.

21:59.992 --> 22:02.419
Take a load off.

22:08.066 --> 22:10.301
Many winters ago...

22:10.302 --> 22:14.972
the white eyes gave us this land

22:14.973 --> 22:19.510
for as long as the grass
grows and the water flows.

22:19.511 --> 22:23.514
But as you can see, we got screwed.

22:23.515 --> 22:25.249
What are you getting at?

22:25.250 --> 22:27.685
I think he wants a
piece of the action.

22:27.686 --> 22:30.681
No, not me.

22:30.689 --> 22:33.081
The Great Spirit.

22:47.773 --> 22:51.633
Okay, we'll give your tribe...

22:52.244 --> 22:55.446
twenty percent of anything we find.

22:55.447 --> 22:59.808
Twenty percent? Two percent. Two.

23:00.686 --> 23:05.456
Okay, twenty percent if
the information pays off.

23:05.457 --> 23:10.027
We want to hear about an Aztec priest
who got here in the 16th century.

23:10.028 --> 23:11.920
Do you know the story?

23:11.964 --> 23:14.465
- You'll tell us.
- I'll tell you.

23:14.466 --> 23:18.069
But you're probably not
going to believe me.

23:18.070 --> 23:20.497
I know just how you feel.

23:21.540 --> 23:23.568
Come with me.

23:26.745 --> 23:29.747
He was called Firewalker...

23:29.748 --> 23:34.285
because his soul could
fly to the sun.

23:34.286 --> 23:38.322
He would gather his
power, and his power...

23:38.323 --> 23:41.853
oh, was great.

23:57.509 --> 24:00.244
- What was I talking about?
- The firewalker.

24:00.245 --> 24:01.779
Oh, yes.

24:01.780 --> 24:05.516
Now I remember.
It was the Spaniards.

24:05.517 --> 24:11.220
They came in search of
the firewalker's gold.

24:11.456 --> 24:13.090
What happened to the firewalker?

24:13.091 --> 24:16.621
Legend says he flew to the sun...

24:16.962 --> 24:22.366
there to walk among
the fire forever.

24:22.367 --> 24:25.870
This is the story of the firewalker.

24:25.871 --> 24:28.298
It's all I know.

24:30.075 --> 24:31.776
That's it? That's our big lead?

24:31.777 --> 24:36.180
Beware of the coyote. He is
very treacherous and powerful.

24:36.181 --> 24:39.650
I don't care about coyotes.
I want to know where the gold is.

24:39.651 --> 24:42.820
If I knew that,
I'd go get it myself.

24:42.821 --> 24:47.557
- Twenty percent?
- Don't blame me.

24:51.263 --> 24:52.930
Wait.

24:52.931 --> 24:55.666
Soon, many spirits will
come to speak to you.

24:55.667 --> 24:59.336
Some will be evil and very strong.

24:59.337 --> 25:02.540
This will help protect you
from the evil spirits.

25:02.541 --> 25:04.008
What is it?

25:04.009 --> 25:08.973
It's dust, bones, magic.

25:15.954 --> 25:18.051
Thank you.

25:18.824 --> 25:21.922
I don't know how Tonto did it.

25:41.413 --> 25:45.950
Okay, we've got gold,
human sacrifice,

25:45.951 --> 25:48.385
the dagger and the sun.

25:48.386 --> 25:49.520
Gin.

25:49.521 --> 25:51.322
- We're playing poker.
- Oh.

25:51.323 --> 25:53.147
Max.

25:55.627 --> 25:58.496
The Spanish conquered
the Aztecs in 1522.

25:58.497 --> 26:01.232
Now, the date on this
painting says 1527.

26:01.233 --> 26:04.335
According to your theory,
it took Aztec priests five years

26:04.336 --> 26:06.270
to get here from somewhere
in Central America.

26:06.271 --> 26:09.807
All I know is, if that
gold isn't in that cave,

26:09.808 --> 26:11.742
then it has to be somewhere else.

26:11.743 --> 26:14.345
Right, right... now, we've got half
of Central America to choose from.

26:14.346 --> 26:16.170
Where would you like to start?

26:18.984 --> 26:21.684
You're so smart.

26:25.857 --> 26:27.124
San Miguel?

26:27.125 --> 26:28.893
Right in between Aztec
and Mayan country.

26:28.894 --> 26:31.685
You believe in witches, Leo?

26:54.152 --> 26:57.021
I bring a potion from Tall Eagle.

26:57.022 --> 27:01.258
He has cast a spell to
protect you from evil.

27:01.259 --> 27:03.549
I never turn down a good potion.

27:14.673 --> 27:16.565
Heady stuff.

28:40.759 --> 28:44.392
Max, you son of a bitch! Wake up!

29:25.904 --> 29:29.867
Good night... coyote.

29:38.984 --> 29:40.876
How is he?

29:41.052 --> 29:43.683
He's sleeping like a baby.

29:43.788 --> 29:46.055
He's been drugged, though.

30:06.444 --> 30:10.509
I thought this trip was the most
important thing in my life.

30:10.782 --> 30:14.018
But if anything happens
to you or Max...

30:14.019 --> 30:17.287
Then it would be our
fault, not yours.

30:17.288 --> 30:23.260
Look, if we weren't out there
chasing that pot of gold,

30:23.261 --> 30:25.756
I'd be somewhere
chasing another one.

30:28.666 --> 30:31.235
- It's what we do.
- Is the money really worth it?

30:31.236 --> 30:33.303
- Not so far.
- Then why do you do it?

30:33.304 --> 30:35.594
Because Max does.

30:36.341 --> 30:38.509
He has a way of getting
things out of me

30:38.510 --> 30:41.335
that I never knew I had in me.

30:43.048 --> 30:46.483
Okay, so you do it
because he does it,

30:46.484 --> 30:48.652
and he does it because he
wants to find buried treasure.

30:48.653 --> 30:51.717
It's not the finding
that Max thrives on.

30:52.057 --> 30:53.657
It's the looking.

30:53.658 --> 30:57.484
- Even though it's so dangerous.
- Because it's so dangerous.

31:00.865 --> 31:04.234
Look, if you want to
turn back, it's okay.

31:04.235 --> 31:06.136
If we find anything,
you'll still get your share.

31:06.137 --> 31:08.672
No, I can't do that.

31:08.673 --> 31:12.409
It's very complicated, Leo, but this
is something that I have to do.

31:12.410 --> 31:14.278
Besides, you guys'll
take care of me.

31:14.279 --> 31:15.879
Sure, if you get killed,
we won't owe you a dime.

31:15.880 --> 31:19.706
Well, hey, a girl can't ask
for a better deal than that.

31:22.987 --> 31:24.788
Well, we better get some sleep.

31:24.789 --> 31:28.456
He's gonna be hell to catch
up with when he wakes up.

31:29.994 --> 31:33.092
I'm gonna stay with
him just a little while.

32:00.758 --> 32:02.826
But she was here.
I know she was here!

32:02.827 --> 32:04.528
There's no way out!

32:04.529 --> 32:08.031
- Man, this is getting too weird.
- Yeah, let's get out of here.

32:08.032 --> 32:09.199
Back home, right?

32:09.200 --> 32:12.369
Nope. San Miguel.
We're gonna find that gold.

32:12.370 --> 32:14.371
Wait a minute. I've got
something to say about this.

32:14.372 --> 32:16.673
There's some weird people
around... very weird.

32:16.674 --> 32:19.271
We'd better get home... all the way.

32:32.457 --> 32:36.160
"San Miguel covers an area
of 21,000 square miles.

32:36.161 --> 32:40.430
"The terrain is largely mountainous,
with areas of heavy jungle.

32:40.431 --> 32:43.400
"Farming is the major industry
with bananas as the main export,

32:43.401 --> 32:45.862
and the language is Spanish."

32:53.978 --> 32:56.439
¿Que pasa?

32:59.851 --> 33:02.519
- ¿Que pasa?
- Nada, señor. Nada.

33:02.520 --> 33:05.789
What is happening?

33:05.790 --> 33:07.691
It's a tiny fire in the engine.

33:07.692 --> 33:09.493
It's nothing, Señor.

33:09.494 --> 33:13.661
We're landing, anyway.

33:43.127 --> 33:45.588
Great flight, huh?

34:08.518 --> 34:10.684
I think I got his good side.

34:12.657 --> 34:14.650
This is the big one, Leo.

34:15.460 --> 34:17.818
I feel it in my bones.

34:19.163 --> 34:20.264
Come on, Leo.

34:20.264 --> 34:22.532
You'll feel better when
we get to the hotel.

34:39.317 --> 34:42.085
I'm sure it's a lot
nicer on the inside.

34:43.388 --> 34:46.315
I bet they've got a great bar.

34:54.431 --> 34:57.334
- What the hell?
- Come on, Leo, cheer up.

34:57.335 --> 34:58.735
I'm telling you, this
could be the big one.

34:58.736 --> 35:02.406
We've lost control of this one.
We are not coming back.

35:02.407 --> 35:05.609
- What makes you say a thing like that?
- My instincts, damn it!

35:05.610 --> 35:08.679
- If you felt that way, why did you come?
- Because you did.

35:08.680 --> 35:10.947
I knew you were gonna
blame this on me.

35:11.015 --> 35:13.684
Do you want me to go back, Leo?
Is that what you want?

35:13.685 --> 35:15.852
Yes!

35:15.853 --> 35:18.755
- Well, I'm not going to.
- That's what I thought you'd say.

35:18.756 --> 35:20.614
Idiot.

35:20.825 --> 35:23.894
Then stop acting
like a dadgum sissy!

35:23.895 --> 35:26.363
I am no sissy. Don't you
call me that anymore.

35:26.364 --> 35:28.031
I am no sissy!

35:28.032 --> 35:31.802
I swear, you're getting as
bad as that fruitcake girl!

35:31.803 --> 35:33.470
I'm gonna see this thing through.

35:33.471 --> 35:36.540
- Anytime you want out, just say so!
- I might just do that, you know?

35:36.541 --> 35:38.342
- That's fine with me!
- I just might do that.

35:38.343 --> 35:40.167
Good!

35:40.912 --> 35:44.014
Fruitcake? I'm a fruitcake?

35:44.015 --> 35:46.116
- Are the walls that thin?
- No, your mouth is that big.

35:46.117 --> 35:47.718
Let me tell you something, bucko.

35:47.719 --> 35:50.654
I happen to be a highly
educated, open-minded person

35:50.655 --> 35:53.490
with an I.Q. that will put that
pea brain of yours in a cellar.

35:53.491 --> 35:56.460
So the next time you start blowing
hot air and playing the hero,

35:56.461 --> 35:58.495
just remember, if it wasn't for me,

35:58.496 --> 36:00.163
you wouldn't be here.

36:00.164 --> 36:02.261
Call me for dinner.

36:05.002 --> 36:07.565
Wow.

36:27.992 --> 36:30.594
- One or two of them?
- I don't care.

36:30.595 --> 36:33.829
Well, let's flip for it.

36:35.233 --> 36:37.398
- Heads or tails?
- Tails.

36:43.808 --> 36:47.941
- Mademoiselle.
- Excuse me.

36:53.818 --> 36:55.552
Why don't you show
the picture around?

36:55.553 --> 36:56.653
We'll get the drinks.

36:56.654 --> 36:59.217
I think I'll make me
some new friends.

37:10.635 --> 37:12.493
Muchas gracias.

37:13.571 --> 37:18.307
Twenty bucks for these drinks.
Sure glad it's your money.

37:18.609 --> 37:21.878
Look, if you're still mad because
I called you a fruitcake,

37:21.879 --> 37:24.080
I really didn't mean it.

37:24.081 --> 37:25.649
It's not the first time.

37:25.650 --> 37:28.350
Maybe I am a little nutty.

37:29.787 --> 37:35.024
Well, if you are, you're the
prettiest nut I've ever seen.

37:35.359 --> 37:38.328
Is that your idea of
flattery, Mr. Donigan?

37:38.329 --> 37:40.494
I reckon.

37:40.631 --> 37:43.592
I guess I would like to
know you better, though.

37:44.101 --> 37:45.569
What would you like to know?

37:45.570 --> 37:50.707
I don't know. How about
something... intimate.

37:50.708 --> 37:53.066
Intimate?

37:53.144 --> 37:55.741
Okay.

37:56.047 --> 38:00.016
Ever since I was a
child, I've had visions.

38:00.017 --> 38:02.580
I'd see things, and
then they'd happen.

38:03.287 --> 38:05.789
That scared me, so I
learned to tune it out

38:05.790 --> 38:07.457
until I found this map.

38:07.458 --> 38:10.727
Since then, everything's
been going crazy.

38:10.728 --> 38:13.163
The images have really
been frightening.

38:13.164 --> 38:15.432
That's why I'm here...

38:15.433 --> 38:17.894
to understand what's happened to me.

38:18.469 --> 38:19.669
Is that intimate enough for you?

38:19.670 --> 38:22.372
I was expecting something
simple, you know, like maybe

38:22.373 --> 38:27.041
you... slept in the
nude or something.

38:29.146 --> 38:31.140
I do.

38:32.483 --> 38:35.118
- Did you get anything?
- Does hostility count?

38:35.119 --> 38:38.820
Well, I'm gonna have to
show you how it's done.

38:38.956 --> 38:41.917
- Just be subtle, okay?
- No sweat.

38:47.532 --> 38:49.699
Twenty dollars American
for information!

38:49.700 --> 38:51.558
Max.

38:52.670 --> 38:56.039
I don't think you should be waving
that money around in public like this.

38:56.040 --> 38:58.008
Fifty dollars!

38:58.009 --> 39:00.709
Fifty dollars!

39:04.549 --> 39:07.214
One hundred dollars for information!

39:08.920 --> 39:11.087
One hundred dollars, American!

39:11.088 --> 39:13.116
Sold!

39:22.300 --> 39:24.367
- Ludlow Boggs.
- Max Donigan.

39:24.368 --> 39:27.070
What brings you to San
Miguel, Mr. Donigan?

39:27.071 --> 39:29.839
- We're on a...
- Archaeological expedition.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.641
Yeah, right.

39:31.642 --> 39:33.466
Into the interior?

39:37.081 --> 39:38.615
Not bloody likely.

39:38.616 --> 39:41.017
You'll be shot on sight.

39:41.018 --> 39:43.687
The government isn't letting anyone
in without official clearance.

39:43.688 --> 39:45.853
How well do you know this country?

39:46.791 --> 39:49.115
Well enough.

39:49.427 --> 39:55.187
Oh, I'd never go into the jungle.
However, I know somebody who does.

39:55.533 --> 39:59.836
There was mention of a
hundred dollars, American.

39:59.837 --> 40:01.871
When we hear what we're buying.

40:01.872 --> 40:03.506
Fair enough.

40:03.507 --> 40:06.876
There's a small village 200 miles
from here in the interior.

40:06.877 --> 40:09.179
- Name?
- Chajal.

40:09.180 --> 40:13.973
Find a man named Gutierrez.
He's the best guide in the country.

40:15.152 --> 40:17.253
Tell him I sent you.

40:17.254 --> 40:20.045
Take you to Hell for
the right money.

40:23.794 --> 40:26.585
Ta very much.

40:27.498 --> 40:29.697
Toodaloo.

40:30.468 --> 40:32.428
Wasn't that easy?

40:39.944 --> 40:42.345
He said your mother was a pig
and your father was a dog.

40:42.346 --> 40:44.943
Did he mention my sister?

40:59.463 --> 41:01.564
He's just looking for trouble.

41:01.565 --> 41:04.467
I don't feel like rotting in some
Godawful prison over some bar fight.

41:04.468 --> 41:06.792
I second that.

41:12.076 --> 41:15.470
He said you have sexual
relationships with goats.

41:16.313 --> 41:19.240
No, no, wait. Let me talk to him.

41:32.830 --> 41:35.120
Oh, no, no!

41:42.940 --> 41:45.298
What are you doing?

41:46.377 --> 41:48.701
I'll handle this.

41:49.313 --> 41:52.308
Oh, no!

41:58.089 --> 42:00.090
He's gonna get hurt.

42:00.091 --> 42:03.257
No, he's just working
out his frustrations.

42:04.829 --> 42:06.755
How's it going?

42:06.831 --> 42:09.326
I'm wearing him down.

42:15.940 --> 42:18.002
Oh, Max.

42:30.387 --> 42:32.789
I... I may have been too rash.

42:32.790 --> 42:34.682
Yep.

42:35.126 --> 42:37.393
¡Alto!

42:37.962 --> 42:40.093
¡Alto!

42:45.669 --> 42:50.200
Doesn't feel good, does it?
Say good night.

42:56.013 --> 42:58.681
I never realized what a
spunky devil you are.

42:58.682 --> 43:00.949
I hate fighting.

43:10.361 --> 43:12.458
Hold this.

43:44.428 --> 43:46.354
Max, watch out!

44:10.688 --> 44:13.556
- Are you all right?
- Fine, fine.

44:13.557 --> 44:15.551
Hell.

44:22.399 --> 44:24.461
I'm doing all right.

45:34.238 --> 45:37.233
- Want this gum back?
- No, I got some.

45:43.914 --> 45:46.349
You guys make friends like
this everywhere you go?

45:46.350 --> 45:47.817
At least we got a lead out of it.

45:47.818 --> 45:49.786
What good does it do?
You heard Boggs.

45:49.787 --> 45:51.621
They're never gonna
let us into the interior.

45:51.622 --> 45:53.489
We were lucky to get
out of that bar alive.

45:53.490 --> 45:56.059
Don't worry about
a thing. I got a plan.

45:56.060 --> 45:57.160
It won't work.

45:57.161 --> 45:59.262
- You haven't even heard it yet.
- I'm playing the odds.

45:59.263 --> 46:01.690
- Oh, geez.
- Oh, Jesus.

46:05.002 --> 46:09.238
They're going to Chajal tomorrow.
Going to meet a man named Gutierrez.

46:11.041 --> 46:14.344
- Girl going with them?
- Looks that way.

46:14.345 --> 46:16.134
Good.

46:16.547 --> 46:18.974
I get my payoff now, right?

46:22.152 --> 46:25.021
You want your payoff now?

46:25.022 --> 46:27.690
No, no...

46:27.691 --> 46:29.685
Forget about the money.

46:30.361 --> 46:32.753
Please, no...

47:01.425 --> 47:05.786
I don't believe this.
I just don't believe this.

47:07.331 --> 47:09.365
What if they ask us for our papers?

47:09.366 --> 47:13.302
- What if they do?
- We don't have any papers, Max.

47:13.303 --> 47:16.571
Just act wise and holy.

48:08.692 --> 48:11.687
I hope there's a dining car.

48:36.220 --> 48:39.386
How many pictures
does one person need?

48:44.027 --> 48:46.920
I thought priests were
supposed to be tee-totalers.

48:47.564 --> 48:50.229
I thought nuns were
supposed to be virgins.

48:51.301 --> 48:54.331
Subtlety's not one of
your strong suits, is it?

48:54.705 --> 48:56.539
Leo's the subtle one.

48:56.540 --> 48:58.074
I'm in charge of...

48:58.075 --> 49:00.240
charm.

49:03.647 --> 49:06.082
Max Donigan, if you're
trying to make a pass,

49:06.083 --> 49:08.417
I appreciate the gesture, but...

49:08.418 --> 49:10.913
I hardly think we're dressed for it.

49:16.527 --> 49:18.961
Yeah, I know, but...

49:18.962 --> 49:21.855
you know, you really do look...

49:23.300 --> 49:25.294
good.

49:26.003 --> 49:27.336
Thank you...

49:27.337 --> 49:29.263
I think.

49:39.283 --> 49:40.449
¡Alto!

49:40.450 --> 49:43.946
¡Alto!

49:49.993 --> 49:52.226
¿Que pasa? ¿Que pasa?

50:00.470 --> 50:01.837
Señor! Señor!

50:01.838 --> 50:03.139
What's going on?

50:03.140 --> 50:06.204
We're picking up some soldiers.

50:46.250 --> 50:50.315
Probably just routine questioning.

50:53.090 --> 50:55.858
I don't like the routine.

50:56.126 --> 50:59.520
Maybe they won't get to us.

51:10.207 --> 51:11.674
Si.

51:11.675 --> 51:14.170
He wants to see our papers.

51:15.946 --> 51:20.512
He wants us to
follow him... rapido.

51:33.297 --> 51:36.098
No problem. Just play dumb.

51:36.099 --> 51:38.034
I thought we were
playing wise and holy.

51:38.035 --> 51:40.636
You try wise and holy,
I'll try dumb.

51:40.637 --> 51:41.837
What about me?

51:41.838 --> 51:44.299
- Look virginal.
- Look virginal.

51:50.113 --> 51:53.177
He wants us to deliver
the last rites.

51:55.986 --> 51:58.754
- We can do that.
- But they'll never buy it, Max.

51:58.755 --> 52:00.589
You just have to do
a convincing job.

52:00.590 --> 52:02.024
Me? Why me?

52:02.025 --> 52:04.850
I don't know anything
about this stuff!

52:08.098 --> 52:10.199
Don't even think about it.

52:10.200 --> 52:13.636
- Here, it's your plan. You do it.
- You're just being petty.

52:13.637 --> 52:15.927
- Is that so?
- Yes!

52:20.544 --> 52:23.212
- Say something in Latin.
- I don't know any Latin, Max.

52:23.213 --> 52:25.037
You think they do?

52:27.551 --> 52:29.545
Gracias.

52:52.709 --> 52:57.813
Ax-may, this is all a your alt-fay,

52:57.814 --> 53:00.416
you stupid-ay erk-jay.

53:00.417 --> 53:04.720
- Amen.
- Amen.

53:04.721 --> 53:07.512
Amen.

53:21.171 --> 53:23.836
She found his papers.

53:30.147 --> 53:33.279
It's only a superficial wound.
He's not going to die.

53:35.152 --> 53:40.787
¡Padre! ¡Gracias. Padre!

53:42.125 --> 53:44.586
It's a miracle.
She thinks we did it.

53:56.106 --> 53:58.533
He wants you to bless him.

54:00.410 --> 54:04.646
Epluribus unum.

54:04.648 --> 54:06.916
¡Gracias! ¡Gracias!

54:06.917 --> 54:09.685
¡Muchas gracias. Padre!

54:11.221 --> 54:14.216
What'd I tell you? Piece of cake.

54:26.436 --> 54:28.671
Never a cab when you need one.

54:28.672 --> 54:31.640
I'd feel a whole lot better if I could see
some people around here, wouldn't you?

54:31.641 --> 54:32.775
Depends on who they are.

54:32.776 --> 54:34.343
Come on, you guys.

54:34.344 --> 54:36.577
Okay, you guys, smile.

54:36.713 --> 54:38.707
All right, little closer.

54:39.182 --> 54:41.074
All right, now serious.

54:42.586 --> 54:45.020
- Let's go find Chajal.
- Yep.

54:45.021 --> 54:47.089
I hope they have a
good restaurant there.

54:47.090 --> 54:49.221
I'm starving.

54:49.459 --> 54:50.960
She hasn't quite figured
it out yet, has she?

54:50.961 --> 54:54.525
When she does, you get
to explain it to her.

55:24.694 --> 55:27.830
They've ransacked this place.

55:27.831 --> 55:30.565
There's not a soul around.

55:38.208 --> 55:41.243
So much for... what's his name?

55:41.244 --> 55:44.308
- Gutierrez.
- Yeah.

55:44.381 --> 55:46.375
I heard something.

55:49.486 --> 55:51.878
Just your imagination.

55:52.122 --> 55:56.016
- Here comes my imagination.
- Run for the banana field!

57:22.946 --> 57:24.713
You know, you almost got
me killed back there.

57:24.714 --> 57:26.081
That's gratitude for you.

57:26.082 --> 57:28.440
- Thank you.
- Anytime.

57:34.858 --> 57:38.218
Max? Leo?

57:44.834 --> 57:47.703
Sir, I'm afraid you've
got the wrong idea.

57:47.704 --> 57:50.105
I'm not a nun. See?

57:50.106 --> 57:52.708
I'm an American. My name
is Patricia Goodwin.

57:52.709 --> 57:54.710
I'm a legal secretary
from Los Angeles,

57:54.711 --> 57:56.478
and I know you're probably
not gonna believe it,

57:56.479 --> 57:58.914
but I'm down here visiting friends.

57:58.915 --> 58:01.842
See? No nun!

58:04.487 --> 58:06.845
Señorita.

58:26.109 --> 58:30.003
Okay, Manuel, run away!

58:30.413 --> 58:31.747
Run away!

58:31.748 --> 58:34.015
Beat it!

58:53.236 --> 58:54.837
Give me that thing.

58:54.838 --> 58:57.473
- Where'd you get it, anyway?
- It's a gift from an old lover.

58:57.474 --> 58:58.540
What?

58:58.541 --> 59:00.309
We better get out of here
before those soldiers show up.

59:00.310 --> 59:02.975
Nah, they've given up on us by now.

59:11.221 --> 59:13.818
I figure we've got about...

59:15.225 --> 59:17.526
twelve miles to the nearest town.

59:17.527 --> 59:20.095
Is anybody hungry here besides me?

59:20.096 --> 59:23.626
Unless we can find Gutierrez.
Maybe we can find a guide there.

59:25.135 --> 59:26.835
How much gold do you
think we'll find?

59:26.836 --> 59:28.637
Tell me, Leo...

59:28.638 --> 59:32.965
if you had lots of money,
what would you do?

59:32.976 --> 59:37.405
Buy a sailboat, I guess.
Sail around the world.

59:38.481 --> 59:39.815
You gotta be kidding.

59:39.816 --> 59:43.118
All the globe-hopping we've done,
and you want to sail around the world.

59:43.119 --> 59:44.920
Just once.

59:44.921 --> 59:49.213
Just once, I want to do it in style.

59:49.425 --> 59:52.056
No deserts, no jun...

59:52.996 --> 59:55.130
No mosquitoes.

59:55.131 --> 59:57.922
No guns.

59:58.168 --> 01:00:01.236
Just sandy beaches,

01:00:01.237 --> 01:00:04.940
sipping champagne
in fine restaurants,

01:00:04.941 --> 01:00:08.010
gambling in casinos,

01:00:08.011 --> 01:00:11.678
and women.

01:00:11.981 --> 01:00:14.305
Man, I can't wait.

01:00:14.384 --> 01:00:17.049
I don't remember inviting you.

01:00:17.086 --> 01:00:19.054
You will.

01:00:19.055 --> 01:00:21.857
Is there a shorter route
to this damn village?

01:00:21.858 --> 01:00:23.852
Yes.

01:00:57.560 --> 01:01:01.693
Hey! Don't wander off!

01:01:17.347 --> 01:01:19.637
I'm gonna crash.

01:01:38.801 --> 01:01:41.694
Okay, okay, I'm awake.

01:01:42.672 --> 01:01:45.064
Damn it, Leo, I said...

01:01:50.246 --> 01:01:52.513
It's gonna be one of those days.

01:01:54.651 --> 01:01:56.475
Move!

01:02:19.275 --> 01:02:21.376
- What if they find the dagger?
- The hell with the dagger.

01:02:21.377 --> 01:02:23.576
We've gotta save our lives.

01:03:19.469 --> 01:03:22.499
They're trying to decide
what to do with us.

01:03:24.040 --> 01:03:27.331
Indecision... that's a good sign.

01:03:29.278 --> 01:03:31.909
Got 'em just where we want 'em.

01:03:32.915 --> 01:03:34.349
Stay cool, Leo.

01:03:34.350 --> 01:03:38.142
No matter what happens,
let's just keep our heads.

01:04:01.044 --> 01:04:02.344
We need a new plan.

01:04:02.345 --> 01:04:05.010
Don't you think it's a
little late for that, Max?

01:04:11.821 --> 01:04:13.388
Prepare to die, Yankees.

01:04:13.389 --> 01:04:16.714
- He said...
- I know what he said.

01:04:33.142 --> 01:04:34.709
What's he waiting on?

01:04:34.710 --> 01:04:37.740
Are you in a hurry, Max?

01:04:39.715 --> 01:04:43.643
I always said you were too
pretty for jungle work, Max.

01:04:46.823 --> 01:04:49.022
Corky?

01:04:53.896 --> 01:04:56.095
Hey, cut 'em free.

01:05:10.613 --> 01:05:14.314
¡Por mis amigos!

01:05:19.422 --> 01:05:22.349
- Salud.
- Salud.

01:05:32.034 --> 01:05:33.969
Yeah, it was right after Nam,

01:05:33.970 --> 01:05:36.571
some snot nosed little second looey
had me kicked out of the corps.

01:05:36.572 --> 01:05:40.068
- What'd you do?
- Only thing I could do.

01:05:41.911 --> 01:05:44.146
I cut off the little bastard's ears.

01:05:44.147 --> 01:05:46.972
I got 'em in a pickle jar.
Wanna see?

01:05:48.751 --> 01:05:51.853
So, I kicked some butts
over in Africa for a while,

01:05:51.854 --> 01:05:53.288
till the money ran out.

01:05:53.289 --> 01:05:55.657
- How'd you get here?
- Blind chance.

01:05:55.658 --> 01:05:59.828
Came down here on a drug run.
Heard about the fighting.

01:05:59.829 --> 01:06:02.197
They got one rule down here.

01:06:02.198 --> 01:06:05.167
- You can have what you can take.
- Plenty, right?

01:06:05.168 --> 01:06:09.204
Right! Hell, they're killing
each other... I'm getting rich!

01:06:09.205 --> 01:06:12.838
- Sounds dangerous.
- Nah, piece of cake.

01:06:15.077 --> 01:06:18.937
Go on... he ain't never
danced with a girl before.

01:06:24.287 --> 01:06:27.351
Hell, she's a looker.

01:06:28.491 --> 01:06:31.026
What'll you take for her?

01:06:31.027 --> 01:06:33.226
She's not for sale.

01:06:49.946 --> 01:06:52.145
Watch this careful, now.

01:06:53.316 --> 01:06:56.584
Give me room, son. Give me room.

01:06:58.521 --> 01:07:01.523
Goddammit, that son
of a bitch moved!

01:07:01.524 --> 01:07:02.824
He goddamn moved!

01:07:02.825 --> 01:07:05.183
- No...
- Go on!

01:07:05.361 --> 01:07:07.696
Hope you got life insurance!

01:07:07.697 --> 01:07:10.328
Quiet! I can't concentrate.

01:07:13.903 --> 01:07:15.303
Goddamn it, he didn't move for you!

01:07:15.304 --> 01:07:16.871
- I did it!
- He moved for me!

01:07:16.872 --> 01:07:20.004
- I'm not playing with you anymore!
- Poor sport!

01:07:20.309 --> 01:07:23.043
Biting the hand that fed you!

01:07:40.730 --> 01:07:45.834
Those sons of bitches dropped us
right in the middle of a hornet's nest.

01:07:45.835 --> 01:07:47.966
So...

01:07:48.337 --> 01:07:50.138
after four hours of fightin',

01:07:50.139 --> 01:07:54.238
me and Max is the only ones
in the squad that ain't hit.

01:07:54.343 --> 01:07:56.478
Guess what happens next?

01:07:56.479 --> 01:07:58.507
They give up!

01:07:59.382 --> 01:08:00.615
We whupped 'em so hard,

01:08:00.616 --> 01:08:03.714
they must have thought
there was a thousand of us!

01:08:08.391 --> 01:08:11.293
Oh, we had us some times, Max.

01:08:11.294 --> 01:08:15.163
- You was a pretty good grunt.
- You made me that way.

01:08:15.164 --> 01:08:17.532
Oh, hell, wasn't nothin' I did.

01:08:17.533 --> 01:08:20.035
You got the charm, boy.

01:08:20.036 --> 01:08:22.703
Can't nothin' kill you
if you got the charm.

01:08:22.705 --> 01:08:25.674
Why don't you stick
around a while, Max?

01:08:25.675 --> 01:08:29.444
It'd be great fightin'
side by side again.

01:08:29.444 --> 01:08:31.404
I can't.

01:08:33.716 --> 01:08:35.915
That's what I figured.

01:08:42.825 --> 01:08:45.616
How long you gonna hang
around here, Corky?

01:08:45.627 --> 01:08:49.798
Isn't it time you packed
it up and headed home?

01:08:49.799 --> 01:08:51.232
This is my home.

01:08:51.233 --> 01:08:52.734
You gonna spend the rest of
your life in the jungle?

01:08:52.734 --> 01:08:56.129
Oh, hell, this is just
temporary... till I'm king.

01:09:01.777 --> 01:09:04.746
What's so damn funny about it?

01:09:04.747 --> 01:09:06.046
He didn't mean anything by it.

01:09:06.048 --> 01:09:08.283
A man's gotta have a
goal in life, don't he?

01:09:08.283 --> 01:09:11.712
I aim to give these
people leadership!

01:09:11.854 --> 01:09:14.087
What if they don't want it?

01:09:16.658 --> 01:09:19.586
You know, I never
thought about that!

01:09:23.832 --> 01:09:26.901
You think my idea's
crazy, don't you, Leo?

01:09:26.902 --> 01:09:28.770
Could get you killed.

01:09:28.770 --> 01:09:32.506
Well, now, dying ain't somethin'
I worry about, Leo.

01:09:32.508 --> 01:09:35.104
You know why?

01:10:02.104 --> 01:10:07.671
You see, I got the charm, too.

01:10:17.086 --> 01:10:19.911
You'll never let me go
that far, will you, Leo?

01:10:20.990 --> 01:10:24.190
- No, I won't.
- Glad you're here.

01:10:24.994 --> 01:10:27.429
I'm glad you're my partner.

01:10:27.430 --> 01:10:32.064
- You really mean that?
- Yeah, I do.

01:10:32.067 --> 01:10:34.869
In that case, you can
come on my sailing trip.

01:10:34.870 --> 01:10:37.672
I accept your invitation.

01:10:37.673 --> 01:10:40.775
- Sandy beaches.
- Luxurious hotels.

01:10:40.776 --> 01:10:43.344
Fine restaurants.

01:10:43.345 --> 01:10:46.875
- And... women!
- And... women!

01:10:56.892 --> 01:11:00.929
What do you think, Max?
This is my command vehicle!

01:11:00.930 --> 01:11:02.997
I want you to go out
of here in style.

01:11:02.998 --> 01:11:05.967
- She's a terror in the jungle.
- I bet she is.

01:11:05.968 --> 01:11:09.537
- Bye-bye, Cork.
- Bye-bye.

01:11:09.538 --> 01:11:13.208
Hey, now, listen, Max.
You'll need this.

01:11:13.209 --> 01:11:18.503
You stick to the low jungle,
and look, you can have this back.

01:11:22.952 --> 01:11:25.913
- Watch your back.
- You, too, Corky.

01:11:27.556 --> 01:11:28.990
- Bye.
- Bye.

01:11:28.991 --> 01:11:30.458
Oh, wait, wait, wait!

01:11:30.459 --> 01:11:33.591
¡Presente! ¡Presente!

01:11:49.778 --> 01:11:52.739
Do you think you'll
ever see him again?

01:11:54.416 --> 01:11:56.740
No.

01:12:08.898 --> 01:12:10.498
Which one are we gonna eat first?

01:12:10.499 --> 01:12:13.301
Oh, Max, that's disgusting.
Leo, stop the car!

01:12:13.302 --> 01:12:15.503
That's horrible! Stop it!

01:12:15.504 --> 01:12:18.135
Oh, poor babies.

01:12:19.608 --> 01:12:23.571
Get them out of here!
Max, that's disgusting.

01:12:28.517 --> 01:12:31.653
And that's when we stumbled
onto the Zulu war party.

01:12:31.654 --> 01:12:33.221
- The hunting party.
- Right.

01:12:33.222 --> 01:12:37.158
- A heavily armed Zulu hunting party.
- That wasn't Zulu. They were pygmies.

01:12:37.159 --> 01:12:40.695
Right. Pygmy cannibals. Must
have been a hundred of them.

01:12:40.696 --> 01:12:41.863
Oh, maybe about twenty.

01:12:41.864 --> 01:12:45.166
Leo, if you don't let me tell this,
it's not gonna be worth hearing.

01:12:45.167 --> 01:12:47.302
- Where was I?
- Pygmy cannibals.

01:12:47.303 --> 01:12:50.805
Right... anyway, I don't
speak Zulu or pygmy...

01:12:50.806 --> 01:12:52.807
- Or cannibal.
- Not even cannibal.

01:12:52.808 --> 01:12:55.007
Definitely not cannibal.

01:13:09.592 --> 01:13:12.060
Oh, God!

01:13:12.061 --> 01:13:14.021
How wonderful!

01:13:15.631 --> 01:13:17.465
Might as well camp
here tonight, huh?

01:13:17.466 --> 01:13:21.069
You guys can make camp.
I'm gonna take a bath.

01:13:21.070 --> 01:13:22.236
No, you're not.

01:13:22.237 --> 01:13:25.597
Come on, give me one
good reason why not.

01:13:31.547 --> 01:13:33.939
One good reason.

01:13:53.869 --> 01:13:58.036
I think I better go
wash these dishes.

01:14:07.149 --> 01:14:09.450
I think we're getting
real close, don't you?

01:14:09.451 --> 01:14:12.020
Yeah, I feel a real bond between us.

01:14:12.021 --> 01:14:14.589
No, silly, I mean to the gold.

01:14:14.590 --> 01:14:17.625
Oh... yeah, we should be
there sometime tomorrow.

01:14:17.626 --> 01:14:19.661
That is, if we're not off course.

01:14:19.662 --> 01:14:23.731
- You mean we may be lost?
- No, just off course.

01:14:23.732 --> 01:14:26.659
- What's the difference?
- Attitude.

01:14:44.987 --> 01:14:48.017
You like this life, don't you?

01:14:49.291 --> 01:14:53.728
Yeah, I guess so. Why?

01:14:53.729 --> 01:14:59.033
I don't know... jungles,
deserts, caves.

01:14:59.034 --> 01:15:01.402
It all sort of seems scary to me.

01:15:01.403 --> 01:15:04.535
What scares you, Max?

01:15:07.776 --> 01:15:10.278
Suits.

01:15:10.279 --> 01:15:13.274
Alarm clocks.

01:15:13.549 --> 01:15:16.442
Apartment buildings.

01:15:47.449 --> 01:15:50.149
Oh, my God, it's blood.

01:15:52.354 --> 01:15:54.314
Look.

01:16:12.975 --> 01:16:15.143
Do you think it was the crocodile?

01:16:15.144 --> 01:16:18.242
How the hell should I know?

01:16:21.683 --> 01:16:24.747
He had a feeling about this trip.

01:16:24.853 --> 01:16:27.348
But I wouldn't listen.

01:16:27.589 --> 01:16:30.124
It's not your fault, Max.

01:16:30.125 --> 01:16:33.661
It is my fault! This
whole idea was stupid!

01:16:33.662 --> 01:16:35.588
Stupid!

01:16:39.368 --> 01:16:41.965
What are we gonna do?

01:16:42.337 --> 01:16:43.871
Go back.

01:16:43.872 --> 01:16:46.607
No. No, we can't.

01:16:46.608 --> 01:16:48.743
I said we're going
back, and that's it!

01:16:48.744 --> 01:16:51.045
- What about the gold?
- There is no gold.

01:16:51.046 --> 01:16:53.837
There is, too. I know it!

01:16:54.149 --> 01:16:56.684
Max, it's normal for you
to feel this way, but...

01:16:56.685 --> 01:17:01.615
Look! Don't talk to me about normal.

01:17:02.591 --> 01:17:05.259
I don't need any advice from a...

01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:06.360
A what?

01:17:06.361 --> 01:17:09.564
A fruitcake? Witch woman? Lunatic?

01:17:09.565 --> 01:17:11.799
Go ahead, Max,
I've heard it all before.

01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:13.734
Yeah, I'm different.

01:17:13.735 --> 01:17:16.170
You think I like feeling that way?

01:17:16.171 --> 01:17:18.706
But, damn it, I know
there's gold there.

01:17:18.707 --> 01:17:21.642
Either I'm right, or I'm crazy.

01:17:21.643 --> 01:17:25.606
But I'm gonna find out which,
with or without your help.

01:17:33.655 --> 01:17:36.650
You won't make it alone.

01:17:37.926 --> 01:17:40.751
I will, too.

01:17:40.996 --> 01:17:42.997
So will you.

01:17:42.998 --> 01:17:45.629
Who cares?

01:17:45.767 --> 01:17:47.335
Damn you, Leo!

01:17:47.336 --> 01:17:49.933
Damn you.

01:18:57.940 --> 01:19:00.174
This looks like a
good place to cross.

01:19:00.175 --> 01:19:04.638
- How do you know?
- It's my job to know.

01:19:24.299 --> 01:19:26.233
- Damn.
- What's happening?

01:19:26.234 --> 01:19:28.626
We're sinking.

01:19:28.704 --> 01:19:31.335
Get out! Swim for shore!

01:19:44.353 --> 01:19:46.677
Come on!

01:19:51.393 --> 01:19:54.795
What's the matter? Can't you swim?

01:19:54.796 --> 01:19:57.154
Of course I can swim!

01:19:59.901 --> 01:20:03.192
Oh, God.

01:20:06.141 --> 01:20:08.431
Barely.

01:20:25.660 --> 01:20:27.995
I hate the water.

01:20:27.996 --> 01:20:29.497
Nothing like a morning swim

01:20:29.498 --> 01:20:31.932
to get the old circulation
going, right, Max?

01:20:31.933 --> 01:20:34.166
Yeah, right.

01:20:52.988 --> 01:20:57.155
Nothing like a brisk walk
after a morning swim.

01:21:03.732 --> 01:21:06.090
It's the temple.

01:21:14.142 --> 01:21:15.976
It's the picture from the cave.

01:21:15.977 --> 01:21:19.610
I knew it, Max! We found it!

01:21:32.627 --> 01:21:35.563
We're close to the
gold, Max. I can feel it.

01:21:35.564 --> 01:21:38.525
Look! Over here!

01:21:50.479 --> 01:21:53.577
- It's sealed.
- There's another one over here!

01:22:21.943 --> 01:22:24.574
This one's sealed, too.

01:22:36.358 --> 01:22:38.225
There's got to be an entrance.

01:22:38.226 --> 01:22:44.862
A moving wall or a trap in
the floor or something.

01:22:47.536 --> 01:22:51.794
- What about an open door?
- That would be a refreshing change.

01:22:52.240 --> 01:22:54.769
Come over here.

01:22:59.881 --> 01:23:03.317
What the hell's going on?
This was sealed tight.

01:23:03.318 --> 01:23:06.245
Yeah, well, it's open now.

01:23:06.488 --> 01:23:10.451
Wait... there's something in there.

01:23:10.659 --> 01:23:12.858
I hope so.

01:23:22.337 --> 01:23:24.905
I'm sorry, I guess I'm
just a little jumpy.

01:23:24.906 --> 01:23:27.908
Don't feel bad.
I didn't even hit it.

01:23:27.909 --> 01:23:30.177
You're not very good
with that, are you?

01:23:30.178 --> 01:23:33.310
Here, you take it.

01:23:36.618 --> 01:23:40.410
- Ugly sucker.
- Max, look at this.

01:23:52.334 --> 01:23:55.002
The way in is no longer the way out.

01:23:55.003 --> 01:23:56.503
So what do we do now?

01:23:56.504 --> 01:23:58.906
Well, you found a way in.
Find a way out.

01:23:58.907 --> 01:24:00.507
Oh, sure, blame me.

01:24:00.508 --> 01:24:01.709
If I remember correctly,

01:24:01.710 --> 01:24:03.744
I was the one who said,
"Don't go in there.

01:24:03.745 --> 01:24:04.878
There's something in there."

01:24:04.879 --> 01:24:07.977
But would you listen to me? Oh, no.

01:24:16.925 --> 01:24:18.919
You did it.

01:24:40.448 --> 01:24:42.875
Oh, my God!

01:24:43.451 --> 01:24:46.186
It's Leo! You're not dead!

01:24:46.187 --> 01:24:48.422
- We thought you were dead.
- We thought you were dead, Leo.

01:24:48.423 --> 01:24:50.291
Don't worry, I'll get you down.

01:24:50.292 --> 01:24:53.925
- Stay there.
- No, Max, go back.

01:24:54.162 --> 01:24:56.830
What are you doing up there, anyway?
Never mind. It doesn't matter.

01:24:56.831 --> 01:24:59.963
The only thing that
matters is you're alive.

01:25:00.468 --> 01:25:02.936
Max, you're so stupid.

01:25:02.937 --> 01:25:04.938
You never listen to a word I say.

01:25:04.939 --> 01:25:06.899
Never!

01:25:10.979 --> 01:25:14.114
Welcome, brave one.
We've been expecting you.

01:25:14.115 --> 01:25:15.616
Meet the red cyclops.

01:25:15.617 --> 01:25:17.543
Drop your gun in the water.

01:25:18.119 --> 01:25:20.386
Now!

01:25:29.698 --> 01:25:31.590
Oh, no.

01:25:31.833 --> 01:25:34.498
You have something of mine.

01:25:34.602 --> 01:25:38.005
And as you see, I have
something of yours.

01:25:38.006 --> 01:25:40.541
What's more important?

01:25:40.542 --> 01:25:45.438
Treasure, or the
life of your friend?

01:25:45.747 --> 01:25:47.147
Max, give him the knife.

01:25:47.148 --> 01:25:50.348
I grow impatient, brave one.

01:25:58.026 --> 01:26:00.589
If he goes, so does this.

01:26:00.829 --> 01:26:02.596
Oh, no!

01:26:02.597 --> 01:26:03.797
Give it to him!

01:26:03.798 --> 01:26:07.396
Okay, okay, back off
a minute, will ya?

01:26:08.503 --> 01:26:09.670
Hang on, Leo.

01:26:09.671 --> 01:26:12.740
That's great advice.
Real inspirational.

01:26:12.741 --> 01:26:15.175
Max, my legs are getting tired!

01:26:15.176 --> 01:26:17.034
All right.

01:26:17.045 --> 01:26:19.745
These are my terms.

01:26:20.215 --> 01:26:23.183
I'll give you the dagger,
but we go free.

01:26:23.184 --> 01:26:26.220
I have no need for you.
It is agreed.

01:26:26.221 --> 01:26:30.124
In fact, the girl can go now.

01:26:30.125 --> 01:26:31.992
- Okay, take off.
- No, I'm staying with you.

01:26:31.993 --> 01:26:33.093
- I said beat it!
- No!

01:26:33.094 --> 01:26:35.429
- Yes!
- Will you agree on something?

01:26:35.430 --> 01:26:38.265
All right... I'll go.

01:26:38.266 --> 01:26:39.633
Thank you very much.

01:26:39.634 --> 01:26:43.801
- Be careful.
- Words to live by.

01:26:54.449 --> 01:26:55.983
You fool!

01:26:55.984 --> 01:26:58.719
You thought you were
protecting the girl.

01:26:58.720 --> 01:27:02.122
And all along, you were
bringing her to me.

01:27:02.123 --> 01:27:04.391
I will sacrifice her.

01:27:04.392 --> 01:27:09.458
With her blood, I will gather
the power of the firewalker.

01:27:10.198 --> 01:27:15.367
And my spirit will fly to the sun.

01:27:15.904 --> 01:27:18.194
Spirit this.

01:27:24.646 --> 01:27:29.583
But for this, I would
have killed you long ago.

01:27:29.584 --> 01:27:34.343
You held the power of my
ancestors in your hands.

01:27:34.589 --> 01:27:37.758
But all you could see
was the treasure.

01:27:37.759 --> 01:27:40.925
I leave you to the gods.

01:27:46.301 --> 01:27:48.669
I've gotta find a way in.

01:27:48.670 --> 01:27:51.205
Max, try. You can make it.

01:27:51.206 --> 01:27:54.304
Like you always say...

01:27:54.642 --> 01:27:56.739
I never listen to you.

01:27:59.347 --> 01:28:01.808
I'm coming, you guys.

01:28:04.652 --> 01:28:06.885
W-w-what's that?

01:28:10.592 --> 01:28:12.159
He's gonna flood the place.

01:28:12.160 --> 01:28:15.224
If there's ever a time for
a plan, it's now, Max.

01:28:19.067 --> 01:28:21.334
I don't like the looks of this.

01:28:23.404 --> 01:28:25.466
Oh, Max.

01:28:25.673 --> 01:28:27.462
This is crazy!

01:28:30.612 --> 01:28:32.813
This is the stupidest
thing we've ever done.

01:28:32.814 --> 01:28:35.015
Stop being such a pessimist.

01:28:35.016 --> 01:28:39.219
Excuse me... I guess being all
trussed up and broiled like a lobster

01:28:39.220 --> 01:28:41.455
naturally puts a
damper on my spirits!

01:28:41.456 --> 01:28:44.019
Swing harder!

01:28:44.292 --> 01:28:47.356
You gonna make me do all the work?

01:28:51.599 --> 01:28:54.867
Come on, Leo, use your legs!

01:28:55.703 --> 01:28:57.838
Kill me. Get it over with.

01:28:57.839 --> 01:28:59.540
No...

01:28:59.541 --> 01:29:04.801
Soon, it will be time for you
to help me gather the power.

01:29:04.946 --> 01:29:08.010
Did I mention that
this is a stupid plan?

01:29:08.850 --> 01:29:12.619
Did I mention that this
is all your fault?

01:29:17.458 --> 01:29:18.725
Put this on.

01:29:18.726 --> 01:29:21.460
What did you do with my friends?

01:29:22.297 --> 01:29:24.965
Come on, Leo! It's a piece of cake!

01:29:24.966 --> 01:29:27.233
Put this on.

01:29:44.586 --> 01:29:48.322
- Swing your legs, Leo!
- I'm trying, damn it!

01:29:48.323 --> 01:29:49.489
We gotta make that ledge!

01:29:49.490 --> 01:29:52.952
- Harder! Harder!
- I can't!

01:29:53.094 --> 01:29:55.862
That's the way, that's the way.

01:29:56.297 --> 01:29:58.599
- No strength left.
- Harder, Leo!

01:29:58.600 --> 01:30:01.535
- I can't!
- You're a sissy, Leo!

01:30:01.536 --> 01:30:04.571
The world's tallest sissy!

01:30:04.572 --> 01:30:06.573
Major league wimp!

01:30:06.574 --> 01:30:09.399
You son of a bitch!

01:30:09.410 --> 01:30:11.712
- Attaboy!
- I'm gonna kill you!

01:30:11.713 --> 01:30:14.504
You're gonna make it!
You're gonna make it!

01:30:23.291 --> 01:30:25.217
Come on!

01:31:04.732 --> 01:31:07.727
- Let's go find Patricia.
- Okay.

01:31:18.479 --> 01:31:22.077
When the gods are appeased...

01:31:22.917 --> 01:31:25.986
I will have the power
of my ancestors.

01:31:25.987 --> 01:31:28.311
Damn it.

01:31:39.233 --> 01:31:41.500
That's the only other way.

01:32:24.512 --> 01:32:26.574
Hurry, Leo.

01:32:30.685 --> 01:32:32.509
Come on!

01:32:33.454 --> 01:32:35.846
Come on!

01:33:00.748 --> 01:33:03.516
I have waited long.

01:33:12.593 --> 01:33:15.793
I will wait no longer.

01:33:28.943 --> 01:33:31.472
He's got Patricia.

01:33:43.291 --> 01:33:46.821
- I hit him.
- I don't believe it.

01:34:02.910 --> 01:34:05.545
Hey, that's gratitude for you.

01:34:05.546 --> 01:34:07.335
Are you okay?

01:34:13.187 --> 01:34:15.852
Piece of cake.

01:34:16.324 --> 01:34:18.352
Now what?

01:34:18.426 --> 01:34:19.693
Now we find the gold.

01:34:19.694 --> 01:34:23.019
- Back inside the temple?
- I don't think so.

01:34:32.506 --> 01:34:36.434
The sun... that's it...
it's behind that.

01:34:43.751 --> 01:34:45.848
I've got it!

01:35:00.034 --> 01:35:02.269
You guys! Come here!

01:35:02.270 --> 01:35:03.436
She did it again!

01:35:03.437 --> 01:35:05.363
You guys...

01:35:09.810 --> 01:35:13.170
- Sure dark down there.
- I'll get you a torch.

01:35:14.982 --> 01:35:17.409
Come on, let's go.

01:35:22.323 --> 01:35:24.351
Come on, Leo.

01:35:24.959 --> 01:35:27.060
- Hey, hey, Max.
- What?

01:35:27.061 --> 01:35:30.664
- Were you really worried about me?
- No, not really.

01:35:30.665 --> 01:35:35.026
But if you ever do it again,
I'm gonna kick your dadgum butt.

01:36:51.512 --> 01:36:54.143
Here's your sailboat.

01:36:55.516 --> 01:36:57.715
Thank you very much.

01:37:00.888 --> 01:37:03.246
What's that all about?

01:37:24.812 --> 01:37:29.207
Well, fruitcake... you did it.

01:37:29.984 --> 01:37:31.818
I wasn't crazy, was I?

01:37:31.819 --> 01:37:34.211
- No.
- No.

01:37:36.557 --> 01:37:39.086
Come on, you two,
let's get this stuff packed.

01:37:42.029 --> 01:37:43.430
You look better in white.

01:37:43.431 --> 01:37:46.332
Hey, since we're on a
roll, let's go to Vegas.

01:37:46.333 --> 01:37:48.168
I think I'll buy the
Barbary Coast Hotel.

01:37:48.169 --> 01:37:51.204
- Real estate's where it's at, man.
- I want my own business.

01:37:51.205 --> 01:37:54.507
- I wonder if Bloomingdale's is for sale.
- Where'd you park the car?

01:37:54.508 --> 01:37:56.400
Down by the river.

01:38:29.376 --> 01:38:31.244
Come on, let's see
how tough you are.

01:38:31.245 --> 01:38:33.069
Come on.

01:39:46.253 --> 01:39:49.214
He's not so damn tough.

01:39:49.990 --> 01:39:52.781
Let's get the hell out of here.

01:40:02.336 --> 01:40:04.797
Thank you, Tall Eagle.

01:40:10.110 --> 01:40:11.878
Good night, Coyote.

01:40:11.879 --> 01:40:14.914
- What are you doing?
- Oh, nothing.

01:40:14.915 --> 01:40:17.383
Everything's just fine.

01:40:17.384 --> 01:40:20.675
Has this been a long day or what?

01:41:05.833 --> 01:41:08.635
Man, is this a
beautiful day or what?

01:41:08.636 --> 01:41:10.926
Okay, you guys, smile.

01:41:17.645 --> 01:41:20.879
Great. I'm starving.

01:41:21.448 --> 01:41:23.650
Yes, sir, the last
time we were in Fiji,

01:41:23.651 --> 01:41:26.286
we almost got strung up
by a voodoo witch doctor.

01:41:26.287 --> 01:41:28.187
- You remember that, Leo?
- I remember.

01:41:28.188 --> 01:41:30.590
All that dangerous stuff's
behind us now, right?

01:41:30.591 --> 01:41:31.958
Gone forever.

01:41:31.959 --> 01:41:34.886
Right... to the future.

01:41:35.062 --> 01:41:37.989
To the future!

01:41:42.236 --> 01:41:45.805
- Waiter? More champagne.
- Yes, sir.

01:41:45.806 --> 01:41:52.442
From now on, life is gonna
be one big piece of cake.

01:42:03.424 --> 01:42:09.491
So, gentlemen, we meet again.
