00:00.550 --> 00:02.600
Previously on Medium:

00:02.610 --> 00:05.210
You totally saved me.

00:06.020 --> 00:07.530
It's my mom.

00:07.540 --> 00:10.700
Pain in the ass. Thank you so...

00:10.710 --> 00:12.600
Suzie!

00:13.120 --> 00:18.310
According to this,Cynthia Keener had a
daughter named Suzie who went missing in 1998.

00:20.330 --> 00:22.050
Don't scream. Don't scream,okay?

00:22.060 --> 00:23.640
Don't scream. He'll hear you,okay?

00:23.650 --> 00:27.430
I know where he took her,where
he kept her and the others.

00:28.150 --> 00:29.210
The others?

00:29.220 --> 00:31.300
There was at least one other.

00:31.340 --> 00:33.580
Her name was Johanna.

00:33.590 --> 00:35.180
Oh,my God.

00:35.200 --> 00:36.850
Marion Wheeler?

00:36.860 --> 00:38.720
Are you the owner of this store?

00:38.730 --> 00:40.180
Maybe.

00:40.190 --> 00:41.550
Johanna?

00:41.560 --> 00:45.160
Her disappearance in 1998?

00:45.220 --> 00:47.640
My daughter isn't missing.
She's never been missing.

00:47.650 --> 00:49.150
It means you're wrong.

00:49.160 --> 00:50.560
It means I'm actually...

00:50.600 --> 00:53.310
I'm actually angry that that
woman's daughter isn't dead

00:53.320 --> 00:55.970
because she could have been there
for daughter in her final moments,

00:56.010 --> 00:58.750
if in fact,if she was
ever even in that basement.

00:58.780 --> 00:59.710
What does that mean?

00:59.740 --> 01:01.060
It means you're fired.

01:01.070 --> 01:03.670
Slow down. Are you
telling me you think you...

01:04.000 --> 01:05.450
you actually invented something?

01:05.459 --> 01:06.970
Here's the thingit isn't just a toy.

01:06.980 --> 01:09.690
I actually think that it might
have real world applications.

01:09.700 --> 01:12.320
I figure all that's going
to cost about $30,000.

01:12.330 --> 01:14.900
Joe,come on.

01:14.910 --> 01:18.250
$30,000? We don't even have $3,000.

01:18.260 --> 01:19.580
The girl's college money.

01:19.600 --> 01:22.640
There's almost $32,000
just sitting there.

01:22.650 --> 01:24.340
You know I can't do this.

01:24.350 --> 01:26.810
God,isn't life funny?

01:26.830 --> 01:30.090
I mean,this whole marriage has
always been about me believing in you.

01:30.110 --> 01:33.660
Now the one time,the one time,the
shoe ends up on the other foot...

01:33.670 --> 01:35.240
This is not the same thing.

01:35.290 --> 01:37.690
It's exactly the same thing,exactly.

01:37.720 --> 01:39.220
Where are you going?

01:39.230 --> 01:40.000
What does it matter?

01:40.010 --> 01:40.910
Joe...

01:40.950 --> 01:43.570
Stop it,please!

01:44.530 --> 01:47.980
Oh,God... oh,God.Oh,God.

You watching this,or can
I change it to the news?

03:09.940 --> 03:12.240
No,no,it's your bar. Your TV.

03:12.250 --> 03:14.500
Change it to whatever you like.

03:16.750 --> 03:19.610
You and the missus had a blowup,huh?

03:19.620 --> 03:21.720
Yeah. How did you know?

03:22.770 --> 03:27.670
You've been fiddling with that wedding band for
the last hour and every time the phone rings,

03:27.680 --> 03:30.420
you forward it to voicemail.

03:30.430 --> 03:33.020
Want some advice?

03:33.030 --> 03:35.890
Problems at home never
get solved at a bar.

03:35.900 --> 03:38.530
Next time that thing rings,answer it.

03:38.540 --> 03:40.450
Might be an emergency.

03:40.460 --> 03:43.440
Maybe she needs your help.

03:43.450 --> 03:46.050
Reporting live from just
outside Casa Valley Hospital

03:46.060 --> 03:51.270
where the two young women managed to escape
from their captor early this morning...

03:51.640 --> 03:53.990
Actually,it looks like
she's doing just fine.

03:54.010 --> 03:57.170
Looks like she's right
where she wants to be.

04:02.520 --> 04:04.190
Ms. Keener.

04:04.520 --> 04:06.670
One of your colleagues from
Ameritips is asking for you.

04:06.680 --> 04:09.020
She's in the waiting area.

04:13.060 --> 04:13.950
I'm sorry.

04:13.960 --> 04:15.260
I know I'm not supposed to be here.

04:15.270 --> 04:16.459
I'm supposed to be a secret.

04:16.470 --> 04:18.260
I have to talk to you about something.

04:18.269 --> 04:22.670
Everything I've been seeing in my dreams
the last few nights,everything about Suzie--

04:22.680 --> 04:23.520
it happened.

04:23.550 --> 04:25.080
It did not happen.

04:25.110 --> 04:27.960
Not to my daughter,not nine years ago.

04:27.990 --> 04:29.460
We know that now.

04:29.490 --> 04:31.670
What you saw was happening
to Melanie Linder.

04:31.680 --> 04:33.370
You got the faces confused.

04:33.400 --> 04:36.280
- You put Suzie's face where Melanie's was,and...
- No.

04:36.290 --> 04:38.030
I think I got the faces right:

04:38.040 --> 04:41.320
Suzie's,Johanna
Wheeler's,the kidnapper's.

04:41.350 --> 04:42.930
That makes no sense.

04:42.940 --> 04:44.340
Johanna Wheeler was just freed.

04:44.350 --> 04:48.280
Obviously,she wasn't locked up in a
basement with my daughter nine years ago.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.740
I think she was.

04:51.700 --> 04:53.740
What are you saying?

04:53.750 --> 04:55.360
She was in on it.

04:55.370 --> 04:57.640
She and her boyfriend.

04:57.650 --> 05:02.560
He's not the man who took Suzie,but I believe
he and Johanna had the same arrangement.

05:02.570 --> 05:04.400
What do you mean?

05:06.720 --> 05:08.670
They would
target a girl--

05:08.680 --> 05:10.830
someone they both wanted.

05:10.840 --> 05:14.330
And the boyfriend would kidnap her and
throw her in the basement with Johanna

05:14.350 --> 05:17.300
who would pretend to be a fellow victim.

05:17.320 --> 05:19.160
Why would she do that?

05:19.170 --> 05:22.190
Because she's a sociopath.

05:22.200 --> 05:24.620
Because she thinks it's fun.

05:24.630 --> 05:28.130
Because it's all a big game to her.

05:28.160 --> 05:30.530
She likes
befriending them--

05:30.550 --> 05:36.210
getting them to open up,seducing them,keeping
them close to her,and then watching...

05:37.250 --> 05:40.140
their surprise when she betrays them.

05:40.170 --> 05:43.700
Laughing while they're suffering.

05:44.130 --> 05:47.630
Well,I saw Johanna when
they brought her in.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.020
She didn't look like she
was playing a game to me.

05:50.040 --> 05:51.860
She's acting.

05:51.870 --> 05:54.700
For you,for the police,for the media.

05:54.720 --> 05:56.140
She has to.

05:56.150 --> 06:00.740
The last thing she imagined was that Melanie
Linder would get that gun away from her boyfriend

06:00.750 --> 06:04.530
and kill him with it,before
they could kill her.

06:05.820 --> 06:08.010
Well,that's a very
interesting theory,Allison.

06:08.020 --> 06:13.640
The only problem is,Melanie Linder wasn't the
one who wrestled the gun away from the kidnapper.

06:13.650 --> 06:16.990
Melanie Linder wasn't
the one who shot him.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.670
It was Johanna Wheeler.

06:23.090 --> 06:25.240
I'm home.

06:31.500 --> 06:33.840
You smell like beer.

06:38.000 --> 06:40.650
I don't know what to tell you.

06:40.660 --> 06:42.930
It's not our money to use.

06:42.940 --> 06:45.850
It's the girls' money.

06:45.860 --> 06:48.430
I'm sorry.

06:52.350 --> 06:55.950
Do you want to pick up the
girls or you want me to do it?

06:57.470 --> 07:00.810
You're right. You probably
shouldn't be driving.

07:09.560 --> 07:11.270
Please...

07:11.280 --> 07:13.580
please don't.

07:13.590 --> 07:16.110
Please.

07:22.010 --> 07:23.860
Don't.

07:25.690 --> 07:29.420
If you have to take one of us...

07:30.490 --> 07:32.900
take me.

07:37.060 --> 07:39.540
If you take her,she'll just keep crying.

07:40.230 --> 07:42.570
Me...

07:42.580 --> 07:46.070
I can make you believe I like it.

08:22.100 --> 08:24.570
Not yet.

08:25.530 --> 08:28.670
I have to check my messages.

08:31.670 --> 08:33.230
Hey,sweetie,it's Mom.

08:33.240 --> 08:39.110
Listen,Johanna,I'm sorry to bother you with
this,but the strangest thing just happened.

08:39.610 --> 08:42.950
These two women came to
visit me here at the store.

08:42.960 --> 08:44.900
One of them was a private investigator

08:44.910 --> 08:49.710
and they both seemed to be under
the impression that something...

08:49.720 --> 08:54.590
well,that something terrible
happened to you nine years ago.

08:54.600 --> 08:56.510
I mean,obviously they have
the wrong Johanna Wheeler,

08:56.530 --> 09:00.880
but I don't know,I just thought
you should know just in case.

09:02.020 --> 09:04.380
Next message...

09:04.390 --> 09:06.140
Hello,Ms. Wheeler.

09:06.150 --> 09:09.800
My name is Cynthia Keener and I'm
an investigator with Ameritips.

09:09.820 --> 09:12.420
I'm calling because it recently
came to my attention that

09:12.430 --> 09:18.710
you may have some information regarding a
missing persons case involving a Suzanne Keener.

09:18.720 --> 09:22.260
If you'd call me at your earliest
convenience I'd appreciate it.

09:22.270 --> 09:24.940
I can be reached at...

09:34.090 --> 09:37.120
**********

09:50.330 --> 09:51.890
Daddy?

09:52.200 --> 09:54.550
Daddy,you up?

09:54.930 --> 09:58.540
Bridge... You all right?

09:58.960 --> 10:01.140
Everything all right?

10:01.150 --> 10:03.840
Why are you sleeping in here?

10:03.850 --> 10:07.260
I don't know. It's fun.

10:08.970 --> 10:11.860
Sweetie,what is it?

10:11.870 --> 10:14.540
I think you need to
go to the bank,Daddy.

10:15.120 --> 10:16.370
What are you talking about?

10:16.410 --> 10:17.920
Well,you need money,right?

10:17.930 --> 10:20.430
I heard you and Mommy talking about it.

10:20.440 --> 10:23.950
Yeah,but,Bridge,no one at the bank
is just going to give us money.

10:23.990 --> 10:25.200
But they are.

10:25.210 --> 10:26.960
I had a dream about it.

10:26.970 --> 10:31.480
There's this white-haired man working
there,and he wants to give you a bunch of money.

10:31.490 --> 10:34.300
A white-haired man?

10:35.180 --> 10:37.490
Bridge,this
white-haired man--

10:37.500 --> 10:40.480
he wouldn't be Santa by any chance?

10:40.490 --> 10:41.890
Dad,come on.

10:41.900 --> 10:45.250
I'm nine. Trust me.

10:52.400 --> 10:55.570
Allison,what are you doing here?

10:55.580 --> 10:57.820
Do you have any idea what time it is?

10:57.840 --> 11:01.790
Did you leave a message for Johanna Wheeler
after we met her mother the other day?

11:01.800 --> 11:03.360
Well,yes,I did.

11:03.370 --> 11:06.520
I wanted to make absolutely
sure she didn't know my daughter.

11:06.530 --> 11:07.430
Why?

11:07.440 --> 11:12.540
Her mother left her a
message too,at we were asking

11:12.550 --> 11:15.460
Yesterday you asked me if Johanna
and David Draper were partners,

11:15.480 --> 11:18.710
why would she kill him before
they finished their little game.

11:18.720 --> 11:21.940
Well,now I think I know the answer.

11:21.950 --> 11:24.180
It was us,Cynthia.

11:24.200 --> 11:26.790
We're the reason that she killed him.

11:26.800 --> 11:29.400
We spooked her.

11:31.660 --> 11:37.780
This is Peter Connolly,the man that
I saw torturing Suzie in my dreams.

11:37.790 --> 11:42.990
The man I believe was working
with Johanna Wheeler in 1998.

11:43.000 --> 11:45.670
You think that I'm wrong?

11:45.680 --> 11:47.810
Let's talk to Johanna Wheeler.

11:47.820 --> 11:51.020
Let's talk to Peter Connolly.

12:03.070 --> 12:04.390
Can I help you,sir?

12:04.400 --> 12:06.730
Uh,I don't know,maybe.

12:07.090 --> 12:11.070
Um,a friend of mine recommended that I come
and speak to a colleague of yours about a loan,

12:11.080 --> 12:13.040
but I'm having a hard
time remembering his name.

12:13.060 --> 12:15.800
All I know for sure is
that he has white hair.

12:15.810 --> 12:18.450
Oh,you mean Walter.

12:20.890 --> 12:24.450
Walter,yes. Good ol' Walter.

12:27.380 --> 12:28.860
Miss Wheeler?

12:29.630 --> 12:30.940
Do you have a moment?

12:30.950 --> 12:33.110
If you're reporters,the press
conference is downstairs.

12:33.120 --> 12:35.810
I'm not giving any interviews.

12:35.820 --> 12:39.250
Actually,I'm an
investigator with Ameritips.

12:39.260 --> 12:42.070
My name is Cynthia Keener.

12:44.830 --> 12:47.940
You,uh,left a message on my cell,right?

12:47.950 --> 12:50.670
Something about a missing persons case?

12:50.680 --> 12:52.140
That's right.

12:52.150 --> 12:55.200
I listened to it this morning when the
police returned my personal effects,

12:55.210 --> 12:59.130
but I didn't understand it.

12:59.750 --> 13:02.450
No one I know has ever gone missing;

13:02.460 --> 13:07.360
no family,no friends,no
one except myself,really.

13:08.390 --> 13:10.350
I don't see how I could be of any help.

13:10.360 --> 13:13.350
Well,we were wondering if maybe you'd
be willing to look at a few photographs,

13:13.360 --> 13:16.290
tell us if you recognize
any of the people in there.

13:16.300 --> 13:19.240
Of course,if you think it would help.

13:22.860 --> 13:25.360
I'm sorry. I don't know her.

13:31.840 --> 13:34.380
How about this man?

13:38.060 --> 13:41.850
Maybe you'd like to look
again just to make sure.

13:48.030 --> 13:51.030
I've never seen this
man before in my life.

13:52.750 --> 13:57.620
Well,obviously,the anonymous
tip my office received was bogus.

13:57.630 --> 14:00.430
It happens sometimes.

14:01.370 --> 14:05.290
I'm sorry. I'm confused.

14:07.390 --> 14:12.120
Are you saying that someone told you I had
information about a missing persons case?

14:12.130 --> 14:17.050
Well,earlier this week,my
office received a tip that

14:17.060 --> 14:23.160
this man Peter Connolly
abducted two young women in 1998.

14:23.170 --> 14:29.210
He kept them in a basement,raped them
repeatedly,tortured them,then discarded them.

14:29.710 --> 14:32.610
According to the
person who contacted me,

14:32.620 --> 14:36.640
one of these young women
was my daughter Suzie.

14:36.650 --> 14:39.520
The other one was you.

14:41.430 --> 14:45.740
This some sort of joke?

14:47.160 --> 14:50.850
I was kidnapped this week.

14:50.860 --> 14:53.990
I was raped this week.

14:54.000 --> 14:56.870
If the same thing had
happened to me nine years ago,

14:56.880 --> 14:59.040
don't you think I would have
mentioned it to the police?

14:59.050 --> 15:04.430
If this is a joke,it's being
had at both of our expenses.

15:04.440 --> 15:08.410
Obviously,I love my daughter
very much,Miss Wheeler,

15:08.420 --> 15:11.520
and I would do anything to
find out what happened to her,

15:11.530 --> 15:17.000
even risk upsetting you at what
is clearly a very difficult time.

15:17.010 --> 15:19.280
Please forgive me.

15:21.230 --> 15:27.090
Have you talked to him yet,this,uh,this
Connolly person,the one in the photograph?

15:27.100 --> 15:30.480
No,not yet. He's next on our list.Why?

15:30.490 --> 15:33.160
According to the
person who contacted me,

15:33.170 --> 15:39.610
this man Connolly had a lot in common with
the man who kidnapped you and Melanie Linder.

15:40.510 --> 15:43.320
You know,Ms. Dubois and
I keep asking ourselves,

15:43.330 --> 15:45.950
"Was there any connection
between these two men?

15:45.960 --> 15:46.910
"Did they know each other?

15:46.920 --> 15:50.320
"Was there communication
between them at some point?

15:50.330 --> 15:53.220
"Did they frequent the same nightclubs?

15:53.230 --> 15:56.260
Perhaps they trolled
the same chatrooms."

15:56.270 --> 15:58.220
Or who knows?

15:58.460 --> 16:01.420
Maybe they dated the same woman.

16:03.860 --> 16:07.200
I suppose anything is possible.

16:10.110 --> 16:13.360
Very sorry I couldn't be
of more help,Ms. Keener.

16:13.380 --> 16:17.750
Maybe you'll have more luck
with this Connolly fellow.

16:17.760 --> 16:19.970
Who knows? Maybe he'll even
give you a full confession.

16:19.980 --> 16:25.950
I mean,I get the feeling
that without one,you...

16:25.960 --> 16:29.870
you really don't have much
of a case at all,do you?

16:30.450 --> 16:33.230
Thank you for your time,Miss Wheeler.

16:33.820 --> 16:36.380
We'll be in touch.

16:44.400 --> 16:46.270
Absolutely.

16:46.610 --> 16:48.680
Definitely.

16:50.580 --> 16:52.500
I'll see you then.

16:52.510 --> 16:55.940
Don't do this. Don't go.

16:57.900 --> 17:00.030
Ask me about my day.

17:00.040 --> 17:03.190
Ask me who I was on the phone with.

17:03.200 --> 17:06.550
All right. Who were
you on the phone with?

17:06.560 --> 17:09.010
Cynthia Keener.

17:09.020 --> 17:12.599
She finally managed to track down a
current address for Peter Connolly.

17:12.609 --> 17:14.720
We plan on paying him a visit tomorrow.

17:14.730 --> 17:19.040
See if we have better luck rattling
his cage than we did Johanna Wheeler's.

17:19.050 --> 17:22.750
Are you telling me that you're actually
gonna try and provoke a man who,

17:22.760 --> 17:26.700
according to your dreams,repeatedly raped
and then murdered an 18-year-old girl?

17:26.710 --> 17:29.440
That's sort of the only thing we can do.

17:29.450 --> 17:33.250
We don't have any evidence
to bring the police.

17:35.120 --> 17:38.540
Tell me about your day.

17:40.040 --> 17:41.340
You have a meeting or something?

17:41.350 --> 17:44.630
Yeah,you could say that.

17:44.640 --> 17:45.780
With who?

17:45.790 --> 17:48.670
With Walter,the wondrous
white-haired banker.

17:48.680 --> 17:51.930
The man from Bridgette's dream?

17:52.930 --> 17:55.290
He didn't give you the money,did he?

17:55.300 --> 17:56.840
Well,he wanted to.

17:56.850 --> 17:57.950
But...

17:57.960 --> 18:00.760
But we already have two
mortgages on the house,

18:00.770 --> 18:06.250
and since what I really have
is an invention or actually,

18:06.260 --> 18:08.630
just an idea for an
invention,technically,

18:08.640 --> 18:13.000
I don't really qualify
for a small business loan.

18:13.740 --> 18:16.030
Don't do that.

18:16.040 --> 18:19.300
Don't go sleep out there.

18:19.640 --> 18:23.010
I know you're mad at me.

18:23.020 --> 18:25.670
Can't you just be mad at me in here?

18:25.680 --> 18:27.010
I need that money,Allison.

18:27.020 --> 18:29.080
I need you to sign those papers.

18:29.090 --> 18:31.960
****

18:41.720 --> 18:44.420
It's so peaceful here.

18:44.980 --> 18:47.680
It's so quiet.

18:50.260 --> 18:55.650
I could stay here forever and
ever right here on this spot.

19:08.000 --> 19:09.470
Mom

19:13.820 --> 19:15.850
don't say it.

19:18.330 --> 19:21.190
I know what you're gonna say.

19:21.700 --> 19:25.140
I don't want you to say it.

19:28.020 --> 19:31.270
I mean it,Suzie. I'm your mother.

19:32.390 --> 19:35.960
You have to do what I tell you to do.

19:37.030 --> 19:40.350
I'm sorry,Mom. It's time.

19:43.830 --> 19:46.600
I have go back now.

19:58.090 --> 20:01.610
You know how much I love you,don't you?

20:01.620 --> 20:06.320
You only tell me every
freakin' time I see you.

20:55.680 --> 20:56.670
Sweetie,come on.

20:56.680 --> 20:58.310
Your sister's got a test first period.

20:58.320 --> 20:59.720
You can draw after school.

20:59.730 --> 21:04.150
Dad,the man you spoke to at
the bank,did he look like this?

21:05.670 --> 21:07.790
Bridge,nobody looks like this.

21:07.800 --> 21:11.010
Dad,look closer.

21:11.020 --> 21:12.150
Is that a mustache?

21:12.170 --> 21:15.100
Yeah,didn't I tell
you about the mustache?

21:15.110 --> 21:17.200
You spoke to the
wrong white-haired man.

21:17.230 --> 21:19.370
Bridge,there was only
one white-haired man.

21:19.410 --> 21:21.350
No,but that can't be right!

21:21.360 --> 21:22.640
There has to be two!

21:22.650 --> 21:24.360
No,Bridge,come on,sweetie.

21:24.370 --> 21:25.610
It was a dream,all right? Just a dream.

21:25.620 --> 21:28.500
Now can we please just let it go?

21:29.060 --> 21:30.150
No,I'm sorry.

21:30.160 --> 21:32.770
I've never seen her before.

21:39.710 --> 21:41.760
She's been in the news lately,right?

21:41.780 --> 21:45.840
She and another young woman were kidnapped
and held in a basement for a week.

21:45.850 --> 21:48.240
Sound familiar?

21:49.580 --> 21:53.370
You claim never to have seen this
young woman before in your life,

21:53.380 --> 21:57.120
and yet,my office was contacted
by an individual who says that

21:57.140 --> 22:02.050
you and a partner abducted,raped
and murdered her in 1998.

22:02.060 --> 22:07.150
And with each passing day,my team and I
draw ever closer to you and your partner.

22:07.160 --> 22:09.510
Now,it's gonna take a
little while,but that's okay.

22:09.520 --> 22:11.620
We want to build the
strongest case possible.

22:11.630 --> 22:13.330
We want to be thorough.

22:13.340 --> 22:17.390
That's the only way you can
guarantee the death penalty,really.

22:17.400 --> 22:20.060
But then again,you might
come to your senses.

22:20.070 --> 22:25.480
One of you might confess or cut a deal
with the district attorney's office.

22:25.700 --> 22:29.640
That would be the
smarter move,of course.

22:43.060 --> 22:45.930
Piece-of-crap
rowboat.

22:46.140 --> 22:49.020
These shoes are ruined.

22:49.030 --> 22:51.190
This was wrong.

22:51.200 --> 22:53.380
This was a mistake.

22:53.390 --> 22:54.940
What are you talking about?

22:54.960 --> 22:57.240
Never should've let
you talk me into this.

22:57.250 --> 23:00.940
Hey,baby,hey. Relax.It's over now.

23:00.950 --> 23:02.330
What if somebody finds her?

23:02.340 --> 23:03.940
What if they figure out what we did?

23:03.950 --> 23:05.180
No one is gonna find her.

23:05.190 --> 23:08.290
I just made sure of that.

23:12.210 --> 23:13.360
Honestly.

23:13.380 --> 23:16.840
You're a big,blubbering
mess now,but,mark my words,

23:16.850 --> 23:19.110
in a week,you're gonna want another one.

23:19.120 --> 23:22.080
No. Johanna,no.

23:22.920 --> 23:25.390
This was it.

23:25.740 --> 23:27.960
Never again.

23:28.580 --> 23:31.600
We know that she was the
driving force,Mr. Connolly.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.290
We know that she wanted
it more than you did.

23:34.300 --> 23:37.760
It's important that you felt
remorse,that you stopped.

23:37.770 --> 23:41.290
That's gonna mean something to the jury.

23:41.300 --> 23:44.300
She's the one we really
want,Mr. Connolly.

23:44.310 --> 23:47.870
She's the one who's still doing it.

23:52.830 --> 23:56.660
We can go on accusing Johanna Wheeler and
Peter Connolly till we're blue in the face,

23:56.680 --> 23:59.610
but unless we have any evidence...

24:00.490 --> 24:03.810
I'm sorry I don't have more for you.

24:03.820 --> 24:06.570
Oh,there's no need to apologize.

24:06.580 --> 24:08.920
You've done more for me in the past week

24:08.930 --> 24:14.760
than the entire Phoenix Police Department
has done in the last nine years.

24:21.350 --> 24:23.750
Cynthia,I need you to go down that road.

24:24.000 --> 24:25.890
What? Why?

24:31.070 --> 24:36.880
This is the place I saw in my dreams.
You and Suzie's ghost came here to talk.

24:37.560 --> 24:40.820
I've never been here before in my life.

24:40.830 --> 24:42.270
Something I saw at the house.

24:42.290 --> 24:45.370
Piece-of-crap
rowboat.

24:45.380 --> 24:47.370
These shoes are ruined.

24:47.380 --> 24:50.480
The night that Peter and
Johanna disposed of Suzie's body,

24:50.490 --> 24:52.500
they were both dripping wet.

24:52.510 --> 24:54.960
Johanna said something about a rowboat.

25:05.780 --> 25:08.910
I'm praying it's someone else.

25:21.090 --> 25:23.860
Don't know that you should have
hung around after you called,Allison.

25:23.870 --> 25:27.240
People are starting to ask questions
I don't have good answers to.

25:27.250 --> 25:30.490
Well,how long till the
coroner can give us an ID?

25:30.510 --> 25:32.140
Remains have been down
there a good,long time.

25:32.150 --> 25:34.940
All he can tell at this
point is that they're female.

25:34.950 --> 25:36.540
That,and there are three metal pins.

25:36.550 --> 25:39.360
In her left femur?

25:41.280 --> 25:45.630
Suzie had a skiing accident in 1989.

25:46.600 --> 25:51.160
She broke her leg. It's her.

25:56.960 --> 26:01.890
identified the body that was recovered from
the bottom of Tyler Lake earlier this afternoon,

26:01.900 --> 26:03.460
as Suzanne Keener,

26:03.470 --> 26:09.110
a 19-year-old woman who disappeared from the parking
lot of a Phoenix strip mall almost nine years ago.

26:09.120 --> 26:13.850
Channel 9's Dawn Velasquez was able to
catch up with Suzanne's mother,Cynthia,

26:13.860 --> 26:17.420
as she left the coroner's
office a short while ago.

26:17.430 --> 26:21.460
I'm saddened to have the very long
search for my daughter end this way,

26:21.470 --> 26:27.000
but I'm also very encouraged by the great deal of
physical evidence that was recovered with Suzie's body,

26:27.010 --> 26:28.620
so for now,I'm...

26:28.630 --> 26:31.760
I don't remember you saying
anything about physical evidence.

26:31.770 --> 26:32.910
'Cause there wasn't any.

26:32.920 --> 26:34.860
Just an old skeleton in a tarp.

26:34.870 --> 26:36.010
She's bluffing?

26:36.020 --> 26:38.180
She wanted to give the killers
something to think about.

26:38.190 --> 26:39.590
See what shakes out.

26:39.600 --> 26:43.160
Remind me to never play
poker with that woman.

26:49.090 --> 26:51.940
I need you to promise me.

26:51.950 --> 26:54.310
We're gonna pay this money back.

26:54.320 --> 26:59.810
Before we pay down the house,before we buy
any cars,we are going to pay this money back.

26:59.820 --> 27:00.660
We're not gonna need to.

27:00.670 --> 27:03.690
I know that if I can just get this idea
in front of some venture capitalists...

27:03.700 --> 27:05.670
Worst-case scenario.

27:05.680 --> 27:08.640
Worst-case scenario. You have my word.

27:09.950 --> 27:11.970
Fine.

27:12.610 --> 27:13.560
Tomorrow morning.

27:13.570 --> 27:16.320
Whatever you need,I'll sign it.

27:22.000 --> 27:24.150
I suppose you expect me
to sleep with you now.

27:24.160 --> 27:28.280
No,in fact,I've decided I'm
never sleeping with you again.

27:30.110 --> 27:32.600
Well,hold on a second.

27:34.070 --> 27:36.340
Allison?

27:38.890 --> 27:44.310
but I'm also very encouraged by the great deal of
physical evidence that was recovered with Suzie's...

27:47.850 --> 27:48.960
Hello?

27:48.970 --> 27:50.640
Who did you tell about the girl,Peter?

27:50.650 --> 27:52.560
What? Who is this?

27:52.570 --> 27:54.180
Who do you think it is?

27:54.190 --> 27:56.200
Her mother paid me a visit today.

27:56.210 --> 27:59.390
She asked me a bunch of questions,but
I didn't tell her anything.

27:59.400 --> 28:02.320
She said her office received
an anonymous tip about me.

28:02.330 --> 28:04.510
Yeah. She said the same thing to me.

28:04.520 --> 28:09.630
The funny thing is,I never told
a soul about our darling Suzie.

28:09.640 --> 28:11.230
You think that I did?

28:11.570 --> 28:12.800
I don't know.

28:12.810 --> 28:16.510
I mean,between the two of us,you
always did have the more,uh...

28:16.820 --> 28:19.170
delicate constitution.

28:19.180 --> 28:21.850
Well,I-I have wanted to tell.

28:21.860 --> 28:23.830
I've wanted to get it off
my chest for a long time.

28:23.840 --> 28:28.290
I've just never been,um,strong enough.

28:29.030 --> 28:30.870
I believe you.

28:30.900 --> 28:33.300
They said on the news they
found physical evidence.

28:33.800 --> 28:35.520
What do you think they've got,Pete?

28:35.530 --> 28:38.990
Your blood? Your semen?

28:39.000 --> 28:41.320
That body's been at the bottom
of that lake for nine years.

28:41.330 --> 28:43.320
There wouldn't be
anything left but bones.

28:43.340 --> 28:44.450
You think they're bluffing?

28:44.460 --> 28:47.600
Yeah,of course they're bluffing.

28:50.050 --> 28:53.840
I know it's hard,baby,but you...

28:53.850 --> 28:56.630
you've got to be strong for me,okay?

28:56.650 --> 28:59.030
Just... just for a little while longer.

28:59.040 --> 29:03.970
We keep our mouths shut,and
all of this goes away,I promise.

29:04.340 --> 29:07.130
Tell me you can do it. Come on.

29:07.140 --> 29:10.180
Tell me you can be strong.

29:15.510 --> 29:16.960
Sorry.

29:18.030 --> 29:18.770
Hello?

29:18.780 --> 29:20.860
Peter Connolly just called me.

29:20.870 --> 29:23.280
He wants to talk about a deal.

29:23.850 --> 29:25.100
You're kidding me?

29:25.110 --> 29:28.630
No,he keep everything very
hypothetical at this point.

29:28.640 --> 29:31.750
"If I was a party to this.
If I was a party to that."

29:31.760 --> 29:34.990
But I could hear it in his voice.

29:35.000 --> 29:36.380
He's starting to crack.

29:36.390 --> 29:38.270
Cynthia,that's wonderful.

29:38.280 --> 29:39.810
I know,I'm leaving for
his house right now.

29:39.820 --> 29:41.380
I thought you might want to meet me.

29:41.400 --> 29:42.130
Me?

29:42.140 --> 29:43.970
Well,yeah,you started
this thing,Allison.

29:43.980 --> 29:47.030
It seems only fair
you're there to finish it.

29:47.510 --> 29:50.860
Oh,well,I should be an hour or two,tops.

29:50.870 --> 29:52.530
You're sure you're okay with the girls?

29:52.540 --> 29:53.880
Yeah,it's Saturday,babe.

29:53.890 --> 29:57.540
What's there to do but watch
cartoons and eat cereal?

29:58.500 --> 29:59.960
What? What's going on?

29:59.970 --> 30:03.100
Well,it's Saturday. The bank
closes early on Saturdays.

30:03.110 --> 30:06.580
I wanted to go by and sign those papers
for you and deposit this retainer check that

30:06.590 --> 30:08.790
Cynthia gave me for this week.

30:08.800 --> 30:12.310
Cover that check that we
sent to Dr. Bondi on Thursday.

30:12.320 --> 30:14.750
Tu crippling debt es mi crippling debt.

30:14.760 --> 30:17.330
I'll take it to the
bank when Ariel gets up.

30:17.340 --> 30:18.770
You go.

30:18.780 --> 30:21.100
Bring that nice lady some closure.

30:21.110 --> 30:22.390
Everything's covered here.

30:22.400 --> 30:23.600
We'll sign the papers on Monday.

30:23.610 --> 30:24.900
Bye,stinkus.

30:24.910 --> 30:28.040
Did I hear you say
you're going to the bank?

30:30.090 --> 30:32.120
You're not fooling anyone,you know.

30:32.130 --> 30:33.260
What do you mean?

30:33.270 --> 30:37.210
I mean,I know you're only here 'cause
you want to look for the white-haired man.

30:40.280 --> 30:42.700
I can help the next customer.

30:44.100 --> 30:46.380
- I'd like to deposit that,please.
- Sure

30:46.390 --> 30:47.710
Daddy! Daddy,come quick!

30:47.720 --> 30:49.960
I found him! I found him!

30:49.970 --> 30:53.100
Sorry. Excuse me a minute.Bridge...

30:55.270 --> 30:57.590
Daddy!

30:58.140 --> 30:59.410
- Are you all right?
- Are you okay?

30:59.420 --> 31:03.260
Just a little fall. Oh,thank you.Thanks.

31:51.500 --> 31:54.640
Ms. Keener. Mrs. Dubois.

31:55.590 --> 31:57.570
You killed him,didn't you?

31:57.590 --> 31:59.140
You knew he was going to speak with us.

31:59.150 --> 32:03.100
You knew he was going to
give you up,so you shot him.

32:03.110 --> 32:07.220
Ms. Keener,I don't know
what you're talking about.

32:07.260 --> 32:10.520
Peter Connolly. He's dead.

32:10.530 --> 32:12.190
You,uh...

32:12.200 --> 32:14.160
you showed me his photograph,right?

32:14.170 --> 32:15.890
We found him this
morning in his apartment.

32:15.900 --> 32:17.490
The police believe it was a suicide.

32:17.510 --> 32:19.300
Suicide?

32:19.310 --> 32:22.210
Sounds like a guilty conscience to me.

32:22.220 --> 32:24.030
Maybe you were right about him.

32:24.040 --> 32:26.530
Maybe he did have something to
do with your daughter's murder.

32:26.540 --> 32:30.840
Don't play innocent with
me,you little monster.

32:32.990 --> 32:35.470
Ms. Keener...

32:35.670 --> 32:40.360
I'm so sorry about what
happened to your daughter,

32:40.380 --> 32:45.550
and I'm sure that it's the stress of
finding her body after all these years

32:45.560 --> 32:48.730
that's making you act this way.

32:48.740 --> 32:52.440
But I had nothing to do with her death.

32:52.450 --> 32:55.510
I don't know how to
make that any clearer.

32:55.520 --> 32:59.870
And I really think you should leave now
or I'll be forced to call the authorities.

32:59.900 --> 33:03.970
If you think this is over,you're wrong.

33:07.780 --> 33:09.940
I can go to Detective
Scanlon. I can tell him...

33:09.950 --> 33:13.240
Tell him what? We have nothing,Allison.

33:15.220 --> 33:18.800
Nothing but the knowledge she was there.

33:19.920 --> 33:22.470
I'm so sorry.

33:22.480 --> 33:27.550
You know,I used to think that
not knowing was the worst.

33:27.560 --> 33:30.140
But this is worse.

33:30.450 --> 33:33.570
I know exactly what happened.

33:33.580 --> 33:38.110
I know exactly how my
daughter suffered and died.

33:38.120 --> 33:42.540
And there's not the least amount
of justice I can bring to her.

33:46.120 --> 33:49.030
What are you going to do now?

33:51.020 --> 33:54.370
I'm going to bury my daughter.

33:57.860 --> 34:02.150
I'm going to tell her how sorry I am
there was nothing I can do for her.

34:03.580 --> 34:05.920
See you.

34:08.760 --> 34:10.400
- Hello?
- Hello.

34:10.949 --> 34:12.880
I need to tell you
something,but before I do,

34:12.889 --> 34:15.750
I want to assure you that
everything's perfectly fine.

34:16.120 --> 34:17.460
Okay.

34:17.469 --> 34:22.750
I slipped and fell at the bank,and now I'm in
the emergency room at the Casa Valley Hospital.

34:22.790 --> 34:24.520
Oh,my God,Joe,are you all right?

34:24.530 --> 34:29.280
I've got the slightest little fracture
in my wrist,but other than that,I'm fine.

34:29.300 --> 34:30.590
It hardly even hurts at all.

34:30.610 --> 34:32.900
Besides,I've got Bridgette
right here to keep me company.

34:33.550 --> 34:36.600
She's flirting shamelessly
with a handsome young intern.

34:36.610 --> 34:37.500
You'd be very proud.

34:37.520 --> 34:38.830
Are they putting a cast on you?

34:38.850 --> 34:41.780
Are you going to be able
to drive yourself home?

34:45.710 --> 34:47.270
Joe,are you there?

34:47.280 --> 34:50.400
Sweetheart,I think I'm going
to have to call you back.

34:50.409 --> 34:51.980
Mr. Dubois?

34:52.000 --> 34:54.429
Reginald Smythe,Regional
Manager for Phoenix West.

34:54.440 --> 34:56.650
I oversee all of our downtown branches.

34:56.659 --> 34:59.280
I'd offer my hand,but...

34:59.290 --> 35:00.650
15 grand!

35:00.660 --> 35:05.370
15 freakin' grand just
for falling on my ass.

35:05.390 --> 35:06.830
I think I've found my new calling.

35:06.840 --> 35:09.850
I'm gonna be the guy who falls
down in banks for a living.

35:09.860 --> 35:13.940
Someday I'll branch out-- maybe I'll fall
down in grocery stores,maybe even malls.

35:13.950 --> 35:15.640
Too bad you didn't
crack your skull open.

35:15.650 --> 35:18.210
Maybe you could've gotten the
whole 30 grand you were looking for.

35:18.230 --> 35:19.560
I've been giving that some thought.

35:19.570 --> 35:22.820
I'm starting to think that 30
may have been a little grand.

35:22.830 --> 35:26.830
I think that I can do what
I need to with just this 15.

35:26.840 --> 35:28.180
Husband to wife.

35:28.190 --> 35:31.100
I'm trying to tell you we don't need
to touch the girls' college money.

35:31.120 --> 35:33.860
I'm listening. I am.I hear.

35:34.300 --> 35:38.100
That's... that is
great news.It's just...

35:38.810 --> 35:40.580
Cynthia?

35:44.500 --> 35:47.900
I feel like I wish I never started
dreaming about her daughter.

35:47.910 --> 35:49.330
I wish I'd kept it to myself.

35:49.340 --> 35:51.990
I feel like I've done
something incredibly cruel.

35:52.000 --> 35:53.620
You've been doing this for a while,Al.

35:53.640 --> 35:55.060
You know you don't get
the dreams that you get

35:55.080 --> 35:56.670
because you're supposed
to keep them to yourself.

35:56.680 --> 35:58.450
You get them 'cause you're
supposed to try to help people.

35:58.460 --> 36:01.290
Well,how exactly did I help Cynthia?

36:01.630 --> 36:06.510
You know,how is she better off today
knowing the things that I told her?

36:07.230 --> 36:11.850
How's she going to sleep tonight knowing
who killed Suzie,but not be able to prove it?

36:11.870 --> 36:14.800
Well,maybe Cynthia's not the person
you were supposed to help this time.

36:14.820 --> 36:19.410
Now,because of your dreams,you and Cynthia
started asking questions about Johanna Wheeler.

36:19.440 --> 36:20.950
Johanna,in turn,got nervous.

36:20.960 --> 36:25.420
So nervous,in fact,that she killed her
new partner and let Melanie Linder go.

36:25.440 --> 36:27.450
Now,let's say that you had
kept your dreams to yourself.

36:27.470 --> 36:31.850
Let's say that you hadn't risked telling Cynthia some
pretty terrible things that had happened to her daughter.

36:31.860 --> 36:36.160
Where exactly do you think
Melanie Linder would be tonight?

36:36.720 --> 36:37.820
At home with her parents?

36:37.850 --> 36:41.060
Or at the bottom of a
lake right next to Suzie?

36:41.440 --> 36:46.920
You know,for a faithful manservant you have an
uncanny knack at putting things in perspective.

36:48.550 --> 36:50.050
You should see me do windows.

36:50.060 --> 36:52.890
I wish.In my dreams.

36:53.370 --> 36:55.160
I would love to see that.

36:55.170 --> 36:56.230
Hello?

36:56.240 --> 36:58.350
Allison,it's Cynthia.

36:58.360 --> 37:01.610
I was wondering if you
would meet me someplace.

37:29.780 --> 37:34.030
When she was three years
old,I put Suzie in day care.

37:34.840 --> 37:37.410
Her father had left us.

37:37.420 --> 37:40.680
I needed to go back to work.

37:41.300 --> 37:44.040
It wasn't the greatest place.

37:44.050 --> 37:46.990
I couldn't afford much.

37:49.380 --> 37:52.350
One morning,she came to me crying.

37:52.360 --> 37:55.690
She said she didn't want to go.

37:56.320 --> 38:00.400
The other kids were
mean to her,she said.

38:01.310 --> 38:05.230
They hit her when the
teachers weren't looking.

38:05.240 --> 38:07.400
And she was afraid.

38:07.410 --> 38:10.900
She didn't know what to do.

38:13.470 --> 38:17.710
Well,in those days,I had the
weight of the world on my shoulders.

38:21.040 --> 38:25.530
I was just trying to get through
the week and pay the rent.

38:26.540 --> 38:31.380
And I didn't have time for her
and her little girl problems.

38:31.730 --> 38:33.760
And I got angry with her,and I said,

38:33.770 --> 38:39.360
"Suzie...you've got to
stand up for yourself.

38:40.310 --> 38:44.670
'Cause no one else is gonna
look after you in this life."

38:48.020 --> 38:51.760
She was just three years old.

38:51.770 --> 38:55.140
She was just a baby.

38:56.620 --> 39:00.280
It was my job to look after her.

39:02.540 --> 39:06.590
It was my job to stand up for her.

39:08.730 --> 39:12.440
And now I finally have.

39:22.840 --> 39:24.750
Cynthia...

39:24.760 --> 39:27.800
whose house is this?

40:37.530 --> 40:40.060
It's all right,Allison.

40:40.980 --> 40:43.590
I've called the authorities.

40:43.600 --> 40:46.380
They'll be here in a moment.

40:48.620 --> 40:51.750
What can I do for you,Cynthia?

40:51.760 --> 40:53.950
How can I help?

40:54.770 --> 40:57.480
Take my hand.

40:59.990 --> 41:02.210
Wait with me.
