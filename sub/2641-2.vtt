WEBVTT

00:01.500 --> 00:03.001
Sheldon, you’re wrong.

00:03.005 --> 00:06.008
Wolverine was not born
with bone claws.

00:06.017 --> 00:07.519
Howard, you know me to be
a very smart man.

00:07.524 --> 00:11.528
Don’t you think
if I were wrong, I’d know it?

00:11.539 --> 00:13.541
Okay, first of all...
Give it up, dude.

00:13.547 --> 00:16.049
You’re arguing
with a crazy person.

00:16.056 --> 00:17.559
I’m not crazy.

00:17.563 --> 00:19.064
My mother had me tested.

00:20.575 --> 00:22.577
Hey, guys.
What are you doing here?

00:22.583 --> 00:24.585
What do you mean?
It’s new comic book night.

00:24.591 --> 00:26.593
Yeah, but since you and Penny
finally hooked up, we thought

00:26.598 --> 00:30.101
you two would be having
bouncy naked yum-yum night.

00:30.112 --> 00:33.115
There’s more to life
than sex, Raj.

00:33.124 --> 00:35.126
Okay, who had "Leonard
flames out with Penny

00:35.131 --> 00:37.133
- in less than 24 hours"?
- I did.

00:37.642 --> 00:39.143
Nothing flamed out.

00:39.147 --> 00:41.149
We don’t have to have sex
every night, you know.

00:41.155 --> 00:45.159
You don’t have to,
but it’s highly recommended.

00:45.171 --> 00:47.173
Yeah, take advantage
of that window of opportunity

00:47.681 --> 00:50.684
before it slams shut
on your little dinky.

00:50.693 --> 00:52.695
It’s not a matter
of opportunity.

00:52.701 --> 00:53.702
We’re getting to know
each other.

00:54.206 --> 00:55.708
There’s a learning curve.

00:55.713 --> 00:56.714
What’s there to learn?

00:56.717 --> 00:58.218
You get naked, do nasty
things to each other,

00:58.222 --> 01:00.224
then somebody makes
scrambled eggs and salami.

01:00.230 --> 01:01.231
Easy peasy.

01:01.234 --> 01:02.736
Perhaps what Leonard

01:02.740 --> 01:04.241
is obliquely referring to

01:04.245 --> 01:06.749
is the occurrence of some sort
of sexual dysfunction.

01:06.756 --> 01:10.259
Okay, who had
"Leonard gets a floppy disk"?

01:10.269 --> 01:12.772
Oh, a clever--
albeit obsolete, euphemism

01:12.780 --> 01:15.282
for insufficient blood flow
to the male sex organ.

01:15.289 --> 01:17.792
(chuckles)

01:17.799 --> 01:19.801
Nothing like that happened,
all right?

01:19.807 --> 01:21.809
The sex was... just fine.

01:21.815 --> 01:23.817
Just fine?

01:23.823 --> 01:27.827
Oh, dude, the fourth Harry
Potter movie was "just fine."

01:28.340 --> 01:29.842
I’m not saying it was bad.

01:29.847 --> 01:32.850
I’m just saying it...
wasn’t great.

01:32.858 --> 01:33.859
Okay, when you say
"it wasn’t great,"

01:33.862 --> 01:34.863
do you mean for both of you?

01:35.368 --> 01:36.870
Because we can totally see
it not being great for her.

01:37.376 --> 01:38.878
Am I right?
Oh, yeah.

01:38.882 --> 01:41.384
To tell you the truth,
I think we were both a little--

01:41.391 --> 01:42.392
I don’t know...

01:42.395 --> 01:43.897
Disappointed? Let down?

01:43.902 --> 01:45.904
Ashamed? Horrified?
Repulsed?

01:45.910 --> 01:49.413
All I know is, it wasn’t the wa
y I dreamed it would be.

01:49.423 --> 01:53.928
(scoffs)
Sex is never the way
Idream it’s gonna be.

01:56.450 --> 01:58.953
Because in your dreams
you’re a horse from the waist down.

01:59.965 --> 02:02.467
Excuse me,
Wolverine: Origin.

02:02.976 --> 02:05.979
Miniseries issue two, page 22.

02:05.988 --> 02:07.489
Retractable bone claws.

02:07.996 --> 02:09.997
If you people spent less time
thinking about sex

02:10.003 --> 02:12.006
and more time concentrating
on comic books,

02:12.012 --> 02:14.014
we’d have far fewer of these
embarrassing moments.

02:16.529 --> 02:20.033
# Our whole universe
was in a hot, dense state #

02:20.043 --> 02:23.546
# Then nearly 14 billion years
ago expansion started... Wait! #

02:23.557 --> 02:25.059
# The Earth began to cool #

02:25.063 --> 02:28.066
# The autotrophs began to drool,
Neanderthals developed tools #

02:28.075 --> 02:30.077
# We built the Wall #
# We built the pyramids #

02:30.584 --> 02:33.087
# Math, Science, History,
unraveling the mystery #

02:33.095 --> 02:34.596
# That all started
with a big bang #

02:34.600 --> 02:36.602
# Bang! #

02:36.800 --> 02:39.002
BBT S03E02 "Jiminy Conjecture"
by Mikhel

02:40.600 --> 02:42.101
Sheldon, dinner’s here.

02:42.104 --> 02:44.106
SHELDON:
Tandoori Palace?

02:44.109 --> 02:45.611
No, we went somewhere new.

02:49.122 --> 02:51.625
You’re good-naturedly
ribbing me, aren’t you?

02:52.130 --> 02:54.132
No, look, Mumbai Palace.

02:54.136 --> 02:55.137
Why?

02:55.138 --> 02:57.140
Why would we change?

02:57.144 --> 02:58.646
We had a perfectly good palace.

02:58.648 --> 03:01.651
Tandoori Palace is our palace.

03:01.656 --> 03:03.157
Trust me, this will be
just fine.

03:03.160 --> 03:04.161
(scoffs)

03:04.162 --> 03:05.163
You are the authority

03:05.165 --> 03:08.168
on "just fine."
(snickering)

03:08.173 --> 03:10.175
What’s that supposed to mean?

03:10.178 --> 03:12.180
Yeah, exactly.

03:12.184 --> 03:14.186
"Not bad, but not great."

03:14.189 --> 03:15.190
(stifled chuckles)

03:16.696 --> 03:18.197
What are they talking about?

03:18.200 --> 03:19.702
I don’t know
I know.

03:19.704 --> 03:20.705
As I’m sure
you’re aware...
Duh-duh-duh-duh

03:21.208 --> 03:22.710
duh-duh.

03:22.712 --> 03:25.214
If that’s Morse code,
that’s terrible.

03:26.723 --> 03:28.224
As I was saying,
you and Leonard had

03:28.226 --> 03:29.728
sexual encounter. a disap
pointing

03:29.731 --> 03:30.732
Earlier this evening,

03:30.733 --> 03:32.735
Leonard characterized it
as "just fine."

03:33.240 --> 03:34.241
So what you’re seeing
here is a continuation

03:34.242 --> 03:36.745
of the mocking that followed.

03:39.256 --> 03:40.257
Okay, yeah, well,

03:40.760 --> 03:42.261
I’m just gonna go
eat my dinner elsewhere.

03:42.264 --> 03:44.266
Maybe an airplane
headed for a mountainside.

03:45.773 --> 03:47.274
Penny, wait.

03:47.277 --> 03:48.779
Aah!

03:48.781 --> 03:51.283
What is wrong with you?

03:51.288 --> 03:52.289
(door slams)

03:54.797 --> 03:58.300
I sense I may have crossed
some sort of line.

03:58.306 --> 04:00.809
Yeah, you...
No, don’t tell him
.

04:00.813 --> 04:03.816
Let’s see if he can
figure it out.

04:08.333 --> 04:10.335
Ugh, I am so embarrassed!

04:10.840 --> 04:11.841
Please don’t be mad.

04:11.843 --> 04:12.844
What did you tell them?

04:12.845 --> 04:15.848
Nothing bad, just that
last night was fine.

04:15.853 --> 04:18.355
Fine? You said it was fine?

04:18.360 --> 04:20.362
Yeah, it’s a perfectly
good word.

04:20.365 --> 04:22.367
You put it in front
of "wine" or "dining,"

04:22.370 --> 04:24.873
and you’ve really got something
.

04:27.885 --> 04:30.888
Okay, well, let me ask you this:

04:30.893 --> 04:32.895
How was last night for you?

04:32.899 --> 04:36.402
It was... okay.

04:36.909 --> 04:38.410
Okay?

04:38.413 --> 04:40.916
Yeah, it’s a perfectly
good word.

04:40.920 --> 04:42.922
I mean, you put it
in front of "dokay"

04:42.925 --> 04:44.927
and you really got something.

04:46.936 --> 04:47.937
All right, look,
let’s not overreact, you know?

04:47.939 --> 04:49.440
For a lot of couples,
it takes time

04:49.442 --> 04:50.944
to get to know
each other’s rhythms.

04:50.947 --> 04:52.949
Learn what the other person
wants and likes.

04:52.952 --> 04:54.954
So, you’ve been
through this before?

04:54.957 --> 04:56.458
No.

04:57.965 --> 04:59.967
Okay-dokay.

05:01.474 --> 05:03.977
You know, I think this is
one of those things where

05:03.981 --> 05:05.482
talking about it is not
going to make it better.

05:05.485 --> 05:06.486
Want a glass of wine?

05:06.989 --> 05:08.991
So much.
Okay.

05:08.995 --> 05:10.997
See, we should’ve
done this last night.

05:11.000 --> 05:14.003
You know, have a little wine,
take the edge off.

05:14.008 --> 05:16.510
Actually, ethyl alcohol
inhibits electrical conduction

05:16.514 --> 05:19.517
in the nerve cells and
stimulates reuptake receptors

05:19.522 --> 05:24.527
of inhibitory neurotransmitters
like gamma-aminobutyric acid.

05:27.043 --> 05:29.545
Don’t talk, just drink.

05:32.056 --> 05:33.557
No, you’re misunderstanding

05:33.560 --> 05:37.064
A shiksa goddess
isn’t an actual goddess

05:37.069 --> 05:39.571
And we don’t pray to them.

05:40.077 --> 05:42.579
We prey on them.

05:42.584 --> 05:44.086
Whatever, dude.

05:44.088 --> 05:46.590
The point is, Leonard’s
got one and you don’t.

05:47.096 --> 05:48.597
Is this it?

05:49.102 --> 05:51.604
It was inappropriate to discuss
Leonard and Penny’s sex life

05:52.110 --> 05:53.111
in front of Leonard and Penny.

05:53.613 --> 05:56.616
Oh, good!

05:57.123 --> 05:58.124
(sighs with relief)

05:58.126 --> 05:59.627
Now I can eat.

06:02.637 --> 06:05.640
(cricket chirping)

06:06.147 --> 06:07.648
What’s that?

06:07.650 --> 06:10.153
Sounds like a cricket.
Hang on.

06:10.158 --> 06:14.662
(cricket crping)

06:14.669 --> 06:16.171
Based on the number
of chirps per minute

06:16.674 --> 06:17.675
and the ambient temperature
in this room,

06:17.677 --> 06:21.181
it is a snowy tree cricket.

06:21.187 --> 06:23.689
Oh, give me a freakin’ break.

06:23.693 --> 06:25.695
How could you
possibly know that?

06:25.698 --> 06:27.200
In 1890, Emile Dolbear

06:27.203 --> 06:28.704
determined that there was

06:28.706 --> 06:29.707
a fixed relationship
between the number

06:29.709 --> 06:31.711
of chirps per minute
of the snowy tree cricket

06:31.714 --> 06:33.216
and the ambient temperature.

06:33.219 --> 06:34.720
A precise relationship
that is not present

06:34.722 --> 06:36.724
with ordinary field crickets.

06:36.728 --> 06:39.231
How do you know what the exact
temperature of the room is?

06:39.235 --> 06:41.237
Under the terms of my roommate
agreement with Leonard,

06:41.240 --> 06:42.741
I’ve had unilateral control
of the thermostat

06:42.744 --> 06:45.747
ever since the sweaty night
of ’06.

06:45.752 --> 06:49.756
Okay, you were right about
wolverine and bone claws,

06:49.762 --> 06:52.765
but you’re wrong
about the cricket.

06:52.770 --> 06:54.272
Howard, don’t embarrass
yourself.

06:54.275 --> 06:56.277
The science chirps for itself.

06:56.280 --> 07:00.284
(chuckling):
Humorous word play.

07:00.291 --> 07:01.792
No, no, not this time.

07:01.794 --> 07:03.296
I know insects, my friend.

07:03.299 --> 07:04.800
I spent many

07:04.802 --> 07:06.304
childhood years
capturing them with nets,

07:06.307 --> 07:08.309
putting them in glass jars,
sticking pins through them,

07:08.312 --> 07:10.814
mounting them on corrugated
cardboard with Dymo labels

07:10.818 --> 07:14.322
underneath, identifying
the genus and species.

07:14.328 --> 07:16.330
In Latin.

07:18.339 --> 07:21.842
Oh, dude, you are never
getting a shiksa goddess.

07:22.850 --> 07:24.852
(cricket chirping)

07:24.856 --> 07:26.858
Thatis a snowy tree cricket.

07:26.861 --> 07:28.363
Oecanthus fultoni.

07:28.366 --> 07:31.869
I was done with Latin
by fifth grade.

07:31.874 --> 07:33.376
Okay, okay, tell you what.

07:33.379 --> 07:35.381
I am willing to bet anything

07:35.384 --> 07:36.385
that’s an ordinary
field cricket.

07:36.888 --> 07:38.890
I can’t take your money.

07:38.893 --> 07:40.395
What’s the matter, you chicken?

07:40.398 --> 07:43.401
I’ve always found that
an inappropriate slur.

07:43.406 --> 07:44.907
Chickens are not, by nature,

07:44.909 --> 07:45.910
at all timid.

07:45.912 --> 07:47.414
In fact, when I was young,

07:47.416 --> 07:48.917
my neighbor’s chicken got loose

07:48.920 --> 07:51.923
and chased me up the big elm
tree in front of our house.

07:53.432 --> 07:55.434
.
Chickens can’t climb trees

07:55.438 --> 07:56.439
Thank God.

07:58.946 --> 07:59.947
Okay,

07:59.949 --> 08:01.951
I believe a chicken
made you his bitch.

08:03.459 --> 08:05.461
But the cricket thing,
I don’t buy.

08:05.464 --> 08:06.465
Bet me.

08:06.467 --> 08:08.969
Fair enough.

08:08.973 --> 08:10.975
What stakedo you propose?

08:10.978 --> 08:14.982
I will put up my
Fantastic Four number 48,

08:14.989 --> 08:16.491
first appearance
of Silver Surfer

08:16.994 --> 08:18.996
against your Flash 123,

08:19.000 --> 08:21.002
the classicFlash
of two worlds issue.

08:21.005 --> 08:24.008
All right, you have a wager.

08:24.013 --> 08:26.516
Hmm.
Great.

08:26.520 --> 08:28.021
Now how are you going to
settle it, hmm?

08:28.024 --> 08:30.026
There is no way
to determine the species

08:30.029 --> 08:31.531
of the cricket
without examining it.

08:31.534 --> 08:36.539
(cricket chirping)

08:36.547 --> 08:40.049
(chirping continues)

08:40.056 --> 08:44.059
I wonder what the non-pathetic
people are doing tonight.

08:44.066 --> 08:46.068
(cricket chirping)

08:48.000 --> 08:54.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

08:56.098 --> 08:58.100
More wine?
Hit me.

09:04.622 --> 09:05.623
I don’t see anything.

09:05.624 --> 09:08.126
Shh!

09:08.131 --> 09:12.135
(cricket chirping)

09:12.141 --> 09:13.643
Hallway.

09:17.656 --> 09:18.657
(groaning)

09:18.659 --> 09:20.661
One at a time.

09:28.184 --> 09:30.186
(deep growling)

09:32.195 --> 09:33.697
What was that?

09:33.699 --> 09:36.702
My stomach.

09:36.707 --> 09:38.709
Indian food doesn’t
agree with me.

09:40.718 --> 09:43.220
Ironic, isn’t it?

09:43.224 --> 09:45.727
Shh!

09:45.731 --> 09:46.732
(chirping resumes)

09:47.235 --> 09:49.237
(whispering):
Elevator shaft.

09:50.243 --> 09:53.246
(chirping)

09:53.251 --> 09:54.753
Help me open it.

09:54.755 --> 09:55.756
Are you crazy?

09:55.758 --> 09:58.260
We can’t go down an empty
elevator shaft.

09:58.264 --> 10:00.266
Fine, if you don’t
want to proceed,

10:00.269 --> 10:01.270
then you forfeit the bet,

10:01.272 --> 10:03.274
and I’ll take possession
of your Fantastic Four.

10:04.280 --> 10:05.782
Let’s open her up.

10:07.790 --> 10:10.793
Are you bothered that I can
so easily manipulate you?

10:10.798 --> 10:12.299
Don’t push me, Sheldon.

10:12.301 --> 10:15.805
I may be small, but I took
kung fu when I was 13,

10:15.811 --> 10:18.313
and I remember
a good deal of it.

10:18.317 --> 10:19.819
Oh, really?

10:19.822 --> 10:21.323
Well, I grew up
with an older brother

10:21.325 --> 10:23.327
and a very contentious
twin sister.

10:23.331 --> 10:24.833
And I believe I could
easily best you

10:24.835 --> 10:27.337
in any physical confrontation--
be it noogies, swirlies

10:27.843 --> 10:29.845
or the classic
"Why are you hitting yourself?"

10:31.854 --> 10:36.358
Ooh, big talk from a man who
was once treed by a chicken.

10:39.875 --> 10:41.877
(both chuckle)

10:45.389 --> 10:47.391
What are we drinking now?

10:47.395 --> 10:49.397
Peppermint schnapps.

10:50.403 --> 10:53.406
Why would you buy
peppermint schnapps?

10:53.411 --> 10:55.413
Because I like peppermint,

10:55.416 --> 10:58.419
and it’s fun to say schnapps.

10:58.424 --> 11:01.427
(both laugh)

11:01.432 --> 11:03.434
Hey, Leonard?
What?

11:03.437 --> 11:05.940
Schnapps.

11:05.944 --> 11:07.946
Schnapps.

11:07.950 --> 11:09.952
You’re right
, that is fun.

11:12.461 --> 11:14.964
Be careful.

11:14.968 --> 11:16.970
SHELDON:
If I were not being careful,

11:16.974 --> 11:19.977
your telling me to be careful
would not ke me careful.

11:21.485 --> 11:23.487
(cricket chirping)

11:24.493 --> 11:26.996
Stairwell.

11:27.000 --> 11:29.002
SHELDON:
Uh-oh, flashlight went out.

11:29.006 --> 11:31.508
I need some batteries.

11:31.512 --> 11:33.514
Fellas?

11:35.523 --> 11:37.525
Hello?

11:39.533 --> 11:42.536
It’s really dark down here.

11:43.544 --> 11:45.546
(vomiting)

11:45.549 --> 11:48.552
Oh, sweetie.

11:48.557 --> 11:51.560
You really can’t hold
your liquor, can you?

11:52.568 --> 11:54.070
I’m okay.

11:54.072 --> 11:55.573
Just a little mouthwash,

11:55.576 --> 11:59.080
and then I’m gonna rock
your world.

12:02.595 --> 12:04.597
(vomiting)

12:04.600 --> 12:06.102
Are you okay?

12:13.200 --> 12:16.203
Ugh, Toby, what did you do
in a past life

12:16.207 --> 12:19.210
to be so disgusting now?

12:19.214 --> 12:21.216
His name isn’t Toby

12:21.219 --> 12:23.721
Toby is an absurd name
for a cricket.

12:23.724 --> 12:24.725
What would you name him?

12:24.727 --> 12:26.229
An appropriate cricket name.

12:26.231 --> 12:28.733
For example, Jiminy.

12:28.736 --> 12:30.238
All right,

12:30.240 --> 12:31.741
Sheldon, here we go.

12:31.743 --> 12:34.246
Kleingast’s Field Guide
to North American Insects.

12:34.249 --> 12:35.750
Hey, Toby.

12:35.752 --> 12:38.255
Right here.

12:38.259 --> 12:39.260
See it?

12:39.261 --> 12:40.262
The common field cricket,

12:40.264 --> 12:41.765
AKA Gryllus assimilis,

12:41.767 --> 12:44.270
which is Latin
for "suck it, you lose."

12:44.273 --> 12:46.275
Hang on.

12:46.278 --> 12:47.779
Voil?.

12:47.781 --> 12:49.283
The snowy tree cricket.

12:49.285 --> 12:51.287
AKA Oecanthus fultoni,

12:51.289 --> 12:53.791
which is Latin for
I’ll suck nothing.

12:53.795 --> 12:54.796
Of course I’m joking

12:54.797 --> 12:57.800
because the Latin for that
isnihil exsorbibo.

12:57.804 --> 13:00.307
That is not Toby,

13:00.311 --> 13:01.312
this is Toby.

13:01.313 --> 13:02.814
Raj, what do
you think?

13:02.816 --> 13:05.819
Oh, I really don’t care anymore

13:07.327 --> 13:09.829
God, I had the most
horrible night.

13:09.833 --> 13:11.335
What happened?

13:11.337 --> 13:14.340
Obviously another carnal fiasco
with the shiksi goddess.

13:15.346 --> 13:16.847
Shiksa. Shik-sa.

13:17.351 --> 13:18.352
Forgive me.

13:18.353 --> 13:21.356
Yiddish was not spoken
in east Texas.

13:21.360 --> 13:24.363
And if it was,
it wasn’t spoken for long.

13:24.868 --> 13:25.869
Yeah, fine, whatever.

13:25.870 --> 13:27.872
The point is,
you’re wrong again.

13:27.875 --> 13:30.378
We haven’t established
that I’m wrong once.
All right.

13:30.381 --> 13:31.382
Tell you what.
Let’s go down

13:31.384 --> 13:32.885
to the Entomology
Department

13:32.887 --> 13:34.389
and let Professor
Crley tell us

13:34.391 --> 13:36.393
what kind of cricket
Toby is.

13:36.395 --> 13:37.396
SHELDON:
He’s a snow
y tree cricket,

13:37.398 --> 13:39.400
and his name
is Jiminy.

13:39.402 --> 13:42.405
I bet I could throw
a rock in this room

13:42.410 --> 13:44.912
and come up
with three better friends.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.434
Holy crap.

13:58.948 --> 14:01.951
It’s like Silence
of the Lambs down here.

14:03.459 --> 14:04.460
(screams)

14:06.466 --> 14:08.468
Don’t do that!

14:08.471 --> 14:10.473
You’re such a girl.

14:10.475 --> 14:11.476
They’re just bugs.

14:11.478 --> 14:12.979
Yeah, well,
I don’t like bugs, okay?

14:12.981 --> 14:13.982
They freak me out.

14:14.485 --> 14:15.486
Interesting.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.989
You’re afraid of
insects and women.

14:17.993 --> 14:21.497
Ladybugs must render
you catatonic.

14:23.004 --> 14:26.007
It was a joke.

14:26.011 --> 14:28.514
I made it to lessen
your discomfort.

14:29.520 --> 14:31.021
You’re welcome

14:31.023 --> 14:33.025
(footsteps)

14:36.537 --> 14:37.538
(chuckling): Don’t knock.

14:38.040 --> 14:39.041
Just walk in.

14:39.042 --> 14:41.545
Why be polite to the world’s
leading expert

14:41.548 --> 14:43.550
on the dung beetle?

14:44.054 --> 14:45.556
Excuse me,

14:45.558 --> 14:47.059
are you Professor Crawley?

14:47.061 --> 14:49.063
Who wants to know?

14:49.567 --> 14:52.570
I’m Dr. Cooper
from the Physics Department.

14:52.574 --> 14:54.075
Couldn’t wait, huh?

14:54.579 --> 14:55.580
I’m sorry?

14:55.581 --> 14:57.082
I haven’t even packed yet,

14:57.084 --> 14:59.086
and you’re already
measuring my lab

14:59.089 --> 15:02.092
for one of your godless
laser machines.

15:03.099 --> 15:05.101
No, you don’t understand.

15:05.605 --> 15:07.106
We just want to ask you
a question.

15:07.108 --> 15:10.111
Let me ask you one first.

15:10.115 --> 15:12.117
What’s a world renowned
entomologist

15:12.120 --> 15:13.622
with a doctorate

15:13.624 --> 15:16.126
and 20 years of experience
to do with his life

15:16.129 --> 15:19.633
when the university cuts off
the funding for his lab, huh?

15:19.638 --> 15:21.640
Ask rhetorical questions

15:21.643 --> 15:24.646
that make people
uncomfortable?

15:24.650 --> 15:26.652
(sarcastic laugh)

15:26.654 --> 15:29.156
What’s your deal?

15:29.160 --> 15:32.664
Are they planning to outsource
my job to Bangalore?

15:34.171 --> 15:36.674
I’m from New Delhi.

15:37.179 --> 15:38.681
Maybe you should find
another entomologist.

15:39.183 --> 15:40.685
No, no. We’re here.
Let’s settle this.

15:40.687 --> 15:43.690
Professor, can you identify
our cricket?

15:43.694 --> 15:45.195
Of course I can.

15:45.197 --> 15:48.701
I can identify every insect
and arachnid on the planet.

15:48.706 --> 15:50.207
Not that
that’s going

15:50.209 --> 15:53.212
to keep me from having to move
in with my daughter in Oxnard.

15:53.718 --> 15:54.719
And we’re not talking

15:55.221 --> 15:57.223
Oxnard at the beach. No!

15:57.727 --> 15:58.728
We’re talking
Oxnard

15:58.730 --> 16:01.733
in the onion fields.

16:04.744 --> 16:07.246
Well, could you
look at Toby?

16:07.249 --> 16:08.751
Toby?

16:10.256 --> 16:12.759
What a stupid name
for a cricket.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.767
Told ya.

16:15.770 --> 16:17.271
It’s a field cricket.

16:17.273 --> 16:18.274
Yes!
No, no, wait.

16:18.777 --> 16:20.278
Dr. Crawley, are you sure?

16:20.781 --> 16:22.783
Young man, I’ve been
studying insects

16:22.786 --> 16:24.287
since I was eight years old.

16:24.289 --> 16:26.291
You know what
they used to call me

16:26.294 --> 16:27.295
in school?

16:27.296 --> 16:29.298
Creepy Crawley.

16:29.301 --> 16:31.303
Cruel as that may be,

16:31.306 --> 16:33.308
that is not in itself
a credential.

16:34.313 --> 16:36.315
Let me show you something.

16:36.317 --> 16:38.319
See that?

16:38.322 --> 16:40.324
That’s a Crawley’s dung beetle

16:40.327 --> 16:42.830
I discovered it after spending
six months slogging

16:42.833 --> 16:44.835
through a Bornean rain forest,

16:45.339 --> 16:47.341
while my wife
was back home

16:47.845 --> 16:50.347
shacking up with a two-bit
ornithologist

16:50.350 --> 16:52.352
who lives on a sailboat

16:52.355 --> 16:54.858
and likes to wear
boot-cut jeans!

16:54.861 --> 16:57.363
So, when I tell

16:57.367 --> 17:00.370
you that that’s a common
field cricket,

17:00.876 --> 17:03.378
you can take that
to the damn bank!

17:03.381 --> 17:04.883
Cause God knows I can’t

17:12.904 --> 17:15.906
Well, apparently,
I was wrong.

17:15.911 --> 17:17.913
Congratulations.

17:24.430 --> 17:25.932
Enjoy Oxnard.

17:27.939 --> 17:30.441
I’m sure your daughter’s
looking forward to having you.

17:37.461 --> 17:38.963
Oh, hey, Sheldon.

17:38.965 --> 17:40.967
What you got there?
A new comic book?

17:40.970 --> 17:42.972
Old comic book.

17:42.974 --> 17:45.977
I just retrieved it
from my safe deposit box.

17:45.982 --> 17:48.985
What do you have a safe
deposit box for?

17:48.989 --> 17:51.992
Old comic books.

17:51.996 --> 17:53.998
I lost this
to Wolowitz

17:54.000 --> 17:57.003
in an ill-considered
cricket wager.

17:57.007 --> 18:00.010
What, do they have
Wii cricket now?

18:01.518 --> 18:03.520
That can’t be very popular.

18:03.522 --> 18:05.524
Penny, I’d rather
not talk about it.

18:05.527 --> 18:07.029
Well, if it makes you feel
any better,

18:07.532 --> 18:08.533
I’m not feeling so hot either.

18:10.038 --> 18:12.540
Why would that make
me feel better?

18:12.543 --> 18:15.046
I don’t know, empathy?

18:19.059 --> 18:21.061
Anyway, I’m just saying,

18:21.064 --> 18:23.066
that you’re feeling upset
about something with Howard,

18:23.069 --> 18:25.071
and I’m upset about something
with Leonard.
Yes,

18:25.073 --> 18:27.075
yes, the disappointing
sex.

18:28.080 --> 18:29.581
That’s an inexac
t parallel.

18:30.085 --> 18:32.587
You and Leonard can always
return to being friends,

18:32.590 --> 18:34.092
whereas I can never
return to a state

18:34.095 --> 18:36.097
in which Wolowitz
has not bested me

18:36.099 --> 18:38.601
like Mrs. Riley’
s chicken.

18:38.605 --> 18:41.108
What’s Mrs. Riley’s chicken?

18:41.111 --> 18:44.114
A chicken that was owned
by Mrs. Riley.

18:45.120 --> 18:46.621
Okay, forget the chicken.

18:47.125 --> 18:49.127
Well, I wish I could.

18:49.130 --> 18:51.132
No, no.

18:51.135 --> 18:52.636
You may be right
about me and Leonard.

18:52.638 --> 18:54.140
Of course I’m right

18:54.142 --> 18:57.145
What are the odds I’d be
wrong twice in one week?

18:57.149 --> 18:59.151
No, I mean, we can always go
back to being friends.

18:59.153 --> 19:01.155
I just said that.

19:01.158 --> 19:02.659
This conversation has
started to circle.

19:02.661 --> 19:05.164
Meeting adjourned.

19:08.175 --> 19:09.676
Hello.

19:09.678 --> 19:10.679
Hey.

19:11.182 --> 19:13.184
What’s going on?

19:13.687 --> 19:14.688
Oh, you’d like to catch up

19:15.191 --> 19:16.692
on the events of the
day. All right.

19:16.694 --> 19:19.197
Well, there was a half-hour wait
at the bank

19:19.200 --> 19:20.701
to get into my safe deposit box,

19:20.703 --> 19:23.206
I was forced to talk to Penny
about your sexual problems,

19:23.711 --> 19:24.712
and, oh, yes,

19:24.713 --> 19:26.715
in a moment filled
with biblical resonance,

19:26.718 --> 19:28.720
pride wenteth before my fall,

19:29.224 --> 19:32.727
causing my Flash 123
to goeth to Wolowitz.

19:32.732 --> 19:34.234
Wait a minute.

19:34.236 --> 19:36.738
You talked to Penny
about our sex life?

19:36.741 --> 19:38.243
Leonard, it astonishes me

19:38.746 --> 19:40.248
how you continually fixate
on the trivial.

19:40.751 --> 19:43.254
I lost a bet to Wolowitz.

19:43.257 --> 19:44.758
Right, right.

19:44.760 --> 19:46.262
You’re saying you talked
to Penny?

19:46.264 --> 19:47.765
Ye-Yes.

19:47.767 --> 19:48.268
Interesting.

19:48.269 --> 19:50.271
Hardly.

19:50.273 --> 19:51.274
Excuse me.

19:51.276 --> 19:53.778
Have I crossed some
sort of line again?

19:53.781 --> 19:55.783
Little bit.

19:55.786 --> 19:58.789
Hmm.

20:01.800 --> 20:03.802
Ah, who cares?

20:09.200 --> 20:10.702
Oh, hey.
Hey.

20:11.171 --> 20:12.673
Uh, what did Sheldon
say to you?

20:12.650 --> 20:13.651
Not a lot.

20:13.635 --> 20:15.136
Just that we always
have the option

20:15.113 --> 20:17.115
of going back
to being friends.

20:17.083 --> 20:19.085
Is that what you want?

20:19.054 --> 20:20.556
I don’t know.

20:20.533 --> 20:22.034
I mean, you have to admit

20:22.011 --> 20:25.014
things seemed simpler
when we were just friends.

20:24.967 --> 20:26.469
I guess.

20:26.446 --> 20:28.448
