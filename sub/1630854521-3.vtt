00:08.467 --> 00:10.469
[indistinct whispering]

00:12.972 --> 00:14.849
[continues indistinctly]

00:22.732 --> 00:24.650
[woman 2] Guys, this is such a bad idea.

00:27.778 --> 00:29.739
[indistinct whispering]

00:29.822 --> 00:33.576
[woman 3] Let's just go along,
make sure no one does anything stupid.

00:33.659 --> 00:36.537
-[man 2] We're not getting caught.
-[woman 4] Keep your voices down.

00:37.913 --> 00:40.082
[door creaking]

00:43.002 --> 00:45.671
[gate squeaking]

00:50.301 --> 00:52.052
[man] It's been a long time coming.

00:54.555 --> 00:55.890
-Guys.
-Clara.

00:55.973 --> 00:58.517
Well, I don't think we should do this.

00:58.601 --> 01:00.436
[Ruth] It's fucking late for that now.

01:04.607 --> 01:05.858
[glass shattering]

01:06.567 --> 01:07.443
What was that?

01:07.610 --> 01:09.862
There's someone inside. Go.

01:10.196 --> 01:11.363
Gabri, open up!

01:11.447 --> 01:14.158
[Peter] Clara, no!
Wait, you don't know who's in there.

01:21.081 --> 01:23.167
[door creaks]

01:24.585 --> 01:25.419
Gabri.

01:25.669 --> 01:26.962
[shushes] I'm trying to listen.

01:28.672 --> 01:30.674
[people chattering]

01:30.758 --> 01:31.592
[whispers] What is that?

01:32.510 --> 01:33.636
You check that way.

01:33.886 --> 01:34.970
-[Clara] Did you hear that?
-[people laughing]

01:35.471 --> 01:37.014
-I'm going upstairs.
-Okay.

01:37.097 --> 01:37.932
Through here.

01:40.267 --> 01:41.268
[all screaming]

01:41.352 --> 01:42.728
Stop, stop right there.

01:42.812 --> 01:45.648
This is private property.
How did you get in?

01:47.399 --> 01:48.859
Everyone all right?

01:48.943 --> 01:49.819
Oh, my God!

01:49.902 --> 01:50.986
[Ruth] Fuckers.

01:51.070 --> 01:52.613
[Peter] We need to ensure
they're all out.

01:52.696 --> 01:53.531
Look at this.

01:53.614 --> 01:57.618
We should search the house,
make sure there's no one left inside.

01:57.701 --> 02:00.371
-I search this way, you take that side.
-Okay.

02:06.001 --> 02:07.503
[Peter] Lock the door
so they can't get back in.

02:07.586 --> 02:08.921
[Gabri] Got it.

02:09.004 --> 02:10.339
[door closes]

02:36.490 --> 02:38.492
[creaking]

02:47.793 --> 02:50.004
[stairs creaking]

03:03.934 --> 03:05.477
-[bat squeaking]
-[gasps]

03:06.395 --> 03:07.980
[sighs in relief]

03:15.404 --> 03:16.780
[screams]

03:22.995 --> 03:23.996
[opening theme music playing]

03:36.216 --> 03:38.552
[police officer on phone] Listen to me,
Gamache. Forget Two-Rivers.

03:38.636 --> 03:40.804
Find the missing man from Three Pines.

03:40.888 --> 03:43.724
When I wanted
to investigate a missing persons case,

03:43.807 --> 03:46.143
you made it clear that it wasn't my job.

03:46.226 --> 03:48.604
I also said stay away from that reserve.

03:48.687 --> 03:51.065
But you went there, adding fuel to fire.

03:51.148 --> 03:53.359
What? Three Pines is my punishment?

03:53.442 --> 03:57.988
I actually like it there. Great food,
good people. Close to Iotenen'ton:ni.

03:58.072 --> 03:59.823
Do what you're paid to do, Armand.

03:59.949 --> 04:01.575
[hangs up phone]

04:01.659 --> 04:03.077
God damn it.

04:03.202 --> 04:06.747
[sighs] He really wants to keep us
away from the Two-Rivers.

04:06.997 --> 04:10.376
I've been calling Arisawe, you know,
to pay my respects

04:10.459 --> 04:12.836
but she's not answering any of my calls.

04:14.380 --> 04:16.757
Yeah, me too.

04:17.091 --> 04:20.719
Isabelle, would you look at the file?
Put fresh eyes on it?

04:21.345 --> 04:22.346
Yeah, sure.

04:22.429 --> 04:26.100
We've got to get that family answers,
one way or the other.

04:28.018 --> 04:29.728
[wind blowing]

04:46.829 --> 04:48.539
[Beauvoir] Anybody else have deja vu?

04:48.622 --> 04:50.416
Who'd want to buy this place?

04:50.499 --> 04:52.876
Especially since it's killed one person.

04:52.960 --> 04:56.005
Houses don't kill. People do.

04:57.339 --> 04:59.925
[Beauvoir] We've been assigned
the missing persons now.

05:00.009 --> 05:03.804
He went into the house last night,
apparently never came out.

05:11.854 --> 05:13.147
[Gamache] No power yet?

05:13.230 --> 05:15.190
[Beauvoir] Generator will be up
and running soon.

05:45.846 --> 05:47.598
[bird squawks]

05:53.187 --> 05:54.104
-[bird squawks]
-[loud thud]

06:04.114 --> 06:05.282
[chirps]

06:16.210 --> 06:17.336
-[Lacoste] Patron.
-Hmm?

06:18.587 --> 06:20.339
-Basement's this way.
-Sure.

07:22.151 --> 07:22.985
Jesus!

07:23.068 --> 07:25.779
-You took your time.
-What are you doing here?

07:25.863 --> 07:27.030
Making like the Chief.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.492
Sensing what it was like
for the missing dude in the dark.

07:30.784 --> 07:33.579
-And what was it like, Agent Nichol?
-Dark, sir.

07:34.913 --> 07:36.331
Want to get us up to speed?

07:36.415 --> 07:39.877
Some locals came to check
on the place, caught a few kids

07:39.960 --> 07:42.713
who had broken in, heard a scream
from the basement

07:42.796 --> 07:46.884
and noticed that Marc Fortier was missing.
No one's seen him since.

07:46.967 --> 07:50.679
The first officer here searched
the house and grounds this morning.

07:50.762 --> 07:53.265
I did a second search myself. No one here.

07:53.348 --> 07:55.767
They found one of the kids' phones.

07:56.268 --> 07:57.728
Any signs of a struggle?

07:58.103 --> 07:58.937
No.

08:01.398 --> 08:02.941
It's just a dead-end, sir.

08:06.278 --> 08:07.529
[in French]
Okay. How many officers do we have?

08:07.613 --> 08:09.156
[in French] Around ten?

08:11.200 --> 08:14.119
[Nichol] There's old tunnels
that run under the estate.

08:14.203 --> 08:15.204
[Beauvoir] Okay.

08:40.854 --> 08:42.564
I've got something down here.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.993
[door rattling]

08:55.661 --> 08:57.162
We need to get this open.

08:57.246 --> 08:58.914
[speaking French] How do we
break it ?

09:04.086 --> 09:04.920
Clear.

09:17.557 --> 09:20.185
What are those? They're everywhere.

09:25.232 --> 09:29.820
Kids must have made them
when this was a residential school.

09:29.903 --> 09:31.989
Do you think they locked kids here?

09:32.406 --> 09:37.035
I know they did. Thousands of Indigenous
kids were tortured at these places.

09:38.870 --> 09:39.788
Look at this.

09:44.793 --> 09:47.921
[Lacoste] That looks like syllabics.
Maybe Cree or Inuktitut.

09:48.005 --> 09:49.006
What does it say?

09:49.840 --> 09:50.757
I don't know.

09:50.882 --> 09:52.551
-[Nichol] You can't read it?
-Can you?

09:52.634 --> 09:54.219
-I'm not...
-Agent Nichol.

09:56.013 --> 09:56.847
What's this?

10:00.726 --> 10:02.394
[Lacoste] If it is what I think it is,

10:03.603 --> 10:06.398
the priests and nuns
used to build torture cells

10:06.481 --> 10:08.817
in the crawl space of places like this.

10:08.900 --> 10:11.361
They put kids down there as punishment.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.464
[Gamache] God Almighty.

10:33.633 --> 10:34.885
[groans]

10:39.181 --> 10:40.349
[sighs]

10:41.266 --> 10:46.229
Well, he put up a fight. Someone smashed
his skull in with that rock.

10:46.313 --> 10:48.690
He was alive
when the killer locked him in.

10:48.774 --> 10:50.776
Yeah, he definitely bled out.

10:56.531 --> 10:58.408
[in French]
We've found his body in the basement.

11:12.339 --> 11:14.758
Is it true? You found Marc?

11:15.842 --> 11:16.718
He's dead?

11:17.344 --> 11:18.470
I can't believe it.

11:19.596 --> 11:20.931
Were you here last night?

11:22.015 --> 11:23.058
Uh...

11:26.686 --> 11:31.775
-All of you? What were you doing here?
-Gabri and I are looking after the place.

11:31.858 --> 11:34.361
We went to check
and a few friends tagged along.

11:34.444 --> 11:37.614
We heard noises inside,
we guessed there were kids.

11:37.697 --> 11:42.702
Marc was with us.
But then he just disappeared.

11:42.786 --> 11:45.455
We searched the whole house.
Where'd you find him?

11:45.539 --> 11:47.374
I should talk to the family first.

11:47.457 --> 11:49.876
-But he had no one.
-Hayden was all he had.

11:49.960 --> 11:51.169
Were they related?

11:51.253 --> 11:55.841
Best friends. It's gonna break him,
his daughter Sophie, too.

11:57.592 --> 12:00.554
I need to talk to everyone
who was here last night.

12:08.353 --> 12:09.896
They were all here last night.

12:09.980 --> 12:12.607
-We need to take statements.
-I'll get on it.

12:14.234 --> 12:17.112
What did you think
when you saw that little door?

12:18.280 --> 12:20.115
That it was a storage room.

12:20.615 --> 12:24.161
The surprise was that it was a room
and with a cell inside.

12:25.704 --> 12:27.873
The killer must have known about it.

12:29.249 --> 12:32.627
We're looking for someone
connected to St. Anthony's.

12:32.711 --> 12:34.129
What do we know so far?

12:34.212 --> 12:39.176
Well, it was a residential school
from 1896, run by nuns.

12:39.259 --> 12:42.971
Closed in the '80s, fell into
private ownership, but stayed empty.

12:43.054 --> 12:45.557
Until CC de Poitier bought it last year.

12:45.640 --> 12:46.475
Yeah.

12:49.352 --> 12:50.353
You smell that?

12:58.695 --> 12:59.905
That's gasoline.

13:04.117 --> 13:05.577
It's okay, we're okay.

13:05.660 --> 13:09.331
-We need to speak to the others.
-Let's go.

13:09.664 --> 13:11.791
[Beauvoir speaking French] There is
gas everywhere.

13:54.334 --> 13:56.211
[piano playing]

14:04.386 --> 14:08.431
Chief Inspector Armand Gamache
and my colleague, Jean-Guy Beauvoir.

14:08.515 --> 14:11.601
We're sorry for your loss.
May we speak to your father?

14:11.851 --> 14:15.355
Um, Dad's teaching but he won't be long.

14:17.065 --> 14:18.441
-Come in.
-Thank you.

14:23.863 --> 14:26.658
-You can wait here until he's done.
-[Gamache] Thank you.

14:41.798 --> 14:44.384
[Hayden] Okay, great job today.

14:45.927 --> 14:49.306
Just keep working on those arpeggios,
but great job, okay?

14:53.810 --> 14:55.353
There's your mom. Okay.

14:57.188 --> 14:58.690
[sighs] Hello.

14:58.773 --> 15:01.568
We just had a few questions,
if you have the time.

15:01.651 --> 15:03.153
Sure. Yeah, of course.

15:22.589 --> 15:24.007
Marc was a close friend?

15:24.424 --> 15:28.094
Since college. We always looked
after each other. Best buddies.

15:28.178 --> 15:32.599
He's Sophie's godfather. Sophie's mom
passed when she was three years old.

15:33.183 --> 15:36.978
Marc helped me get back on my feet
and this was my turn to help him.

15:37.228 --> 15:40.899
It couldn't have been easy,
three of you under one roof.

15:40.982 --> 15:42.359
He helped with Sophie.

15:42.442 --> 15:45.070
Driving her while I was working,
making dinner.

15:45.153 --> 15:49.032
I was glad he's gonna be here
when she starts McGill in the Fall.

15:54.954 --> 15:59.042
It's a difficult section.
She has a scholarship.

15:59.584 --> 16:03.213
[Hayden] Schulich. Yeah.
She's going to be a composer.

16:03.338 --> 16:05.173
-[Gamache] It's a great school.
-[Hayden] Yeah.

16:06.091 --> 16:10.679
The nest will feel empty for a while,
but you get used to it eventually.

16:10.762 --> 16:14.766
She's not moving out. She'll commute.
I'll drive her there and back.

16:15.642 --> 16:20.021
Sophie needs a lot of support.
Her vision is too low to drive herself.

16:20.105 --> 16:21.981
Has Sophie always had low vision?

16:22.691 --> 16:24.901
[Hayden]
She was born with ocular albinism.

16:25.694 --> 16:30.115
Hers is quite bad. Her vision's too low
to read but it's never held her back.

16:30.198 --> 16:31.991
Was Marc in a relationship?

16:32.575 --> 16:37.038
His wife died last year. Lymphoma.
He came to stay with us for a few weeks

16:37.122 --> 16:39.833
and ended up staying for good,
which was great.

16:39.916 --> 16:42.377
It's what you do for your best buddy.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.295
Hmm.

16:44.379 --> 16:46.047
Did Marc have any enemies?

16:49.426 --> 16:53.263
No. It was impossible not to like Marc.

16:54.848 --> 16:56.558
He was the kindest guy.

16:57.517 --> 16:59.477
Why did you go to St. Anthony's?

17:02.021 --> 17:04.023
I got swept along with the others.

17:07.152 --> 17:08.903
We should've never gone up there.

17:08.987 --> 17:11.865
Did Sophie go there too?
With other kids, maybe?

17:11.948 --> 17:16.035
No, of course not.
Sophie spends her spare time practicing.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.622
-You ever go inside before?
-No.

17:20.165 --> 17:23.793
Do you know why there was gasoline
on the ground at the school?

17:25.503 --> 17:26.379
I've no idea.

17:31.217 --> 17:33.094
Uh, may we see Marc's room?

17:34.053 --> 17:35.930
Sure, yeah, it's upstairs.

18:51.297 --> 18:55.510
Now, why is a squeaky clean,
straight-A student hitting the bottle?

18:55.593 --> 18:57.136
Stress. Pressure.

18:58.137 --> 19:02.725
Solitude. I'm sure Hayden doesn't know
about his daughter's secret drinking.

19:02.809 --> 19:04.644
Or what is driving her to it.

19:13.403 --> 19:15.321
Perhaps things here aren't as easy

19:15.405 --> 19:16.656
-as they seem.
-Yeah.

19:22.912 --> 19:24.330
[piano stops playing]

19:28.376 --> 19:31.045
A team will come by
and conduct a full search.

19:31.129 --> 19:33.339
Oh, okay, no problem. Uh...

19:33.464 --> 19:36.175
-I'll show them out, Dad.
-Thanks, honey.

19:38.928 --> 19:40.513
What were you doing in my room?

19:43.641 --> 19:46.269
When you can't see perfectly
with your eyes,

19:46.352 --> 19:48.396
you learn to see with your ears.

19:49.355 --> 19:53.359
I wasn't sure which room was Marc's.
I apologize for the intrusion.

19:53.776 --> 19:55.194
Yeah, sorry about that.

20:00.199 --> 20:01.659
[door closes]

20:06.414 --> 20:07.498
I got your text.

20:07.582 --> 20:10.043
Yeah, I think I have something.

20:11.002 --> 20:11.836
Look at this.

20:12.962 --> 20:16.633
[Lacoste] These kids, they have the flash
reflected in their eyes.

20:17.175 --> 20:18.217
Mm-hmm.

20:18.301 --> 20:21.012
Right here. It's coming
from the same direction.

20:23.431 --> 20:29.062
Now look at our missing couple,
Tommy Kis and Blue Two-Rivers. No flash.

20:31.397 --> 20:36.069
This is a composite of two photographs.
It's like somebody photoshopped them in.

20:36.152 --> 20:38.071
Blue and Tommy weren't at this party.

20:40.698 --> 20:42.408
Good work, Isabelle. Good work.

20:43.493 --> 20:45.370
I'll talk to Arnot about the photo.

20:46.204 --> 20:49.082
You go to Iotenen'ton:ni,
talk to Arisawe and Kara.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.834
Find out what you can.

20:53.127 --> 20:55.755
Can't believe my team missed that.
Who's behind it?

20:55.838 --> 20:57.799
Maybe they did it themselves to...

20:57.882 --> 21:01.970
They want to hide where they really are
from cops and their family...

21:02.053 --> 21:03.638
We need to find Kevin.

21:03.721 --> 21:05.932
We only know he crossed the border.

21:06.015 --> 21:10.353
I sent Lacoste back to Iotenen'ton:ni,
see if she can dig up something.

21:10.436 --> 21:12.814
Don't be surprised
if they don't roll out the red carpet.

21:12.897 --> 21:14.023
[scoffs]

21:15.400 --> 21:17.694
Yeah. Could you look at it too?

21:17.777 --> 21:21.990
Yeah, sure. Armand, this could be grounds
to reopen the case.

21:22.448 --> 21:24.158
Thank you. Thank you.

21:26.244 --> 21:29.247
We hold the keys. We have to keep
an eye on the place.

21:29.330 --> 21:31.582
How did you know that kids had broken in?

21:31.666 --> 21:35.086
We didn't. It was a routine check
but we saw lights inside.

21:35.169 --> 21:36.879
Did the kids do any damage?

21:37.505 --> 21:39.007
Graffiti, broken glass.

21:39.132 --> 21:40.800
Uh-huh. Fires?

21:41.426 --> 21:42.260
Fires?

21:42.677 --> 21:45.054
Someone poured gasoline on the ground.

21:45.847 --> 21:48.474
One match, the place could have gone up.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.477
Must have been those kids.

21:51.769 --> 21:55.773
[in French] Though it wouldn't be
the worst thing if it burned to the ground

21:57.400 --> 22:00.737
The realtor said something
about a sale about to go through.

22:00.820 --> 22:03.614
Buyer wanted to turn
the place into a hotel.

22:04.323 --> 22:06.451
Would have been competition, I guess?

22:06.534 --> 22:08.494
-It's not what I meant.
-Pastries?

22:08.578 --> 22:11.539
It's a horror show.
The stuff that's happened there,

22:11.664 --> 22:14.542
-and still going on...
-Nothing. Just ghost stories.

22:14.625 --> 22:18.046
People have heard crying, seen things.
There's a dark presence.

22:18.129 --> 22:21.174
-They call it The Caretaker.
-"The Caretaker"?

22:21.257 --> 22:24.677
Yeah. Came up in the inquiry.
Some survivors mentioned him.

22:24.761 --> 22:29.098
Legend is he's still walking the halls,
looking for new victims to torture.

22:29.182 --> 22:30.183
That's crazy.

22:43.112 --> 22:48.618
Jean-Guy, I found these in Marc's room.
I think that's his father.

22:49.494 --> 22:50.536
And look here.

22:52.371 --> 22:53.664
There he is again.

22:54.373 --> 22:56.751
That looks a lot like a janitor's uniform.

22:57.668 --> 23:01.839
Wait, and that's St. Anthony's.
The Caretaker.

23:21.984 --> 23:26.197
-Pull the short straw again, Chief?
-I was missing Gabri's cooking.

23:26.489 --> 23:28.366
[chuckles]

23:28.533 --> 23:29.367
New exhibit?

23:30.785 --> 23:35.581
For the anniversary. Forty years
since they shut St. Anthony's down.

23:36.457 --> 23:39.710
I know people want us to just
shove it under the rug,

23:39.794 --> 23:43.381
but folks need reminding
about what happened up there.

23:44.132 --> 23:45.216
That's powerful.

23:45.633 --> 23:50.596
Yeah. The whole installation
is going to be done in a couple of days.

23:51.139 --> 23:53.683
Were you at St. Anthony's last night, Bea?

23:54.016 --> 23:56.894
No, I was here, working late.

24:02.984 --> 24:06.654
That's an interesting tattoo you have.
Syllabics, isn't it?

24:07.613 --> 24:09.490
Does it have a special meaning?

24:14.954 --> 24:15.872
It's personal.

24:16.747 --> 24:17.874
I apologize.

24:22.837 --> 24:24.297
I'll be seeing you, Bea.

24:51.449 --> 24:53.242
Any news from the pathologist?

24:53.326 --> 24:56.537
Yes, she confirmed the dirt and debris
inside Marc's head

24:56.621 --> 25:01.167
are consistent with being pushed down
the stairs and dragged into that cell...

25:01.918 --> 25:04.629
Where his head
was bashed in with that rock.

25:04.712 --> 25:09.008
I think whoever killed him poured
the gasoline to burn the place down,

25:09.091 --> 25:10.301
cover their tracks.

25:11.552 --> 25:15.890
Perhaps the plan was to torch the place,
and the murder was unplanned.

25:15.973 --> 25:18.601
Most murders happen
in the heat of the moment.

25:18.684 --> 25:23.314
Yeah. Yeah, but that place was too hard
to find for it not to be planned.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.192
No sign of Marc's cell phone
but I got his laptop.

25:26.275 --> 25:27.860
And you two got an invite.

25:27.944 --> 25:28.945
To what?

25:29.362 --> 25:33.449
Dinner at the Morrows', eight o'clock,
so I guess I'll get takeout.

25:33.532 --> 25:35.409
Yeah, well, I'm not interested.

25:54.136 --> 25:55.263
[knock on door]

25:58.266 --> 25:59.267
Hi.

26:17.076 --> 26:22.915
I am so sorry about Missy, about Blue.

26:24.125 --> 26:25.543
Just all of it.

26:27.670 --> 26:28.587
I know you are.

26:31.590 --> 26:32.675
Come on inside.

26:38.139 --> 26:41.225
Tommy and Blue went to Kevin's
to bum a ride.

26:41.309 --> 26:43.894
Tommy's crazy about Blue,
he wouldn't hurt her.

26:43.978 --> 26:45.604
What about Kevin?

26:45.688 --> 26:48.065
No. Kevin's not a bad kid.

26:48.149 --> 26:51.319
He went off the rails
when his mom passed a few years back.

26:51.402 --> 26:53.988
He had Tommy to support,
he had to make a living.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.197
Moving cigarettes?

26:55.781 --> 27:00.328
What's the big deal? What's the difference
from what big tobacco companies do?

27:00.411 --> 27:03.414
Know what the real crime is?
Tobacco is sacred.

27:03.831 --> 27:06.751
The government turned it
into a natural resource.

27:06.834 --> 27:10.171
If the government can profit off it,
why can't Kevin?

27:13.132 --> 27:15.426
Could you give me directions to his place?

27:15.509 --> 27:18.429
Sure, but I don't think
you'll find anything.

27:19.263 --> 27:22.850
We went there when we knew
she was missing. Nothing out of place.

27:51.295 --> 27:52.630
[door rattles]

29:56.795 --> 29:57.671
[Gamache] Isabelle.

29:57.755 --> 30:00.341
Looks like Tommy and Kevin just vanished.

30:00.424 --> 30:04.136
There's plates in the sink,
Tommy's meds are still in the bathroom.

30:04.220 --> 30:07.223
Nothing to indicate
where they went or what happened.

30:07.306 --> 30:08.891
-Thank you.
-Okay.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.352
[Beauvoir] Everything okay? Right.

30:14.146 --> 30:16.857
I'll take Peter, you take Clara.
She likes you.

30:16.941 --> 30:20.194
No interrogating, keep it polite.
We're here for dinner.

30:20.277 --> 30:21.779
[Beauvoir] Okay, Dad. I'll behave.

30:21.862 --> 30:23.113
[Gamache chuckles]

30:24.740 --> 30:25.824
[knock on door]

30:30.162 --> 30:32.540
I'm so glad you could come. Come in.

30:32.623 --> 30:34.291
[Gamache] Thank you for inviting us.

30:34.375 --> 30:35.834
Just through here.

30:41.173 --> 30:43.467
-We've been ambushed.
-Behave.

30:46.095 --> 30:47.179
-Sit.
-Thank you.

30:47.263 --> 30:49.765
-Now we can eat.
-Would you like red or white?

30:49.848 --> 30:51.767
-Red would be lovely.
-Inspector.

30:51.850 --> 30:53.269
Good evening.

30:55.271 --> 30:56.230
Thank you.

30:59.149 --> 31:00.651
-Sante?
-Sante.

31:02.861 --> 31:06.991
I hope you don't think only murder
happens in Three Pines, Chief Inspector.

31:07.074 --> 31:08.867
No, I know there's eating.

31:08.951 --> 31:10.327
[all chuckle]

31:11.787 --> 31:13.872
So how did Marc kick it, then?

31:14.331 --> 31:17.960
Jesus, Ruth,
could you be any less sensitive?

31:18.043 --> 31:19.920
It's what we're all thinking.

31:22.381 --> 31:25.718
Perhaps all of you could tell us
a little more about Marc.

31:25.801 --> 31:28.178
You were all friends, if you don't mind.

31:28.804 --> 31:34.018
He started painting recently.
Abstracts. Had a lot of talent.

31:35.686 --> 31:37.688
Peter, can I help you in there?

31:39.231 --> 31:40.107
Excuse us.

31:40.691 --> 31:43.944
-"Had a lot of talent"? Seriously?
-Awkward.

31:44.653 --> 31:49.116
If I may ask, did Marc upset anyone?
Recently or in the past?

31:49.199 --> 31:50.034
No.

31:51.076 --> 31:53.120
Did he have any money or assets?

31:53.203 --> 31:56.373
No, and he'd just started
to build up his practice.

31:56.457 --> 31:59.209
-Practice?
-Marc trained as a psychotherapist.

31:59.293 --> 32:00.836
Were any of you his clients?

32:01.003 --> 32:03.547
[chuckles]
Now he thinks we're all fucking crazy.

32:04.506 --> 32:05.341
Not all of you.

32:05.424 --> 32:09.720
You cops, you're such a cliche.
Always looking in the same places.

32:09.803 --> 32:14.308
-What if you look somewhere new for once?
-Might actually find the truth.

32:14.933 --> 32:19.396
What I am saying is there's other reasons
people kill, aren't there?

32:19.730 --> 32:20.606
Enlighten me.

32:20.981 --> 32:24.860
-I'd start with vengeful ghost.
-Gabri! Come on, seriously?

32:24.943 --> 32:26.862
There was something there that night.

32:26.945 --> 32:31.241
Old buildings make sounds at night.
Creaking floorboards, old pipes.

32:31.325 --> 32:34.411
One thing I know
is there's no such thing as ghosts.

32:35.204 --> 32:37.331
I wouldn't be so sure about that.

32:37.831 --> 32:40.042
Whose ghost did the evil deed then?

32:40.125 --> 32:45.839
Was it CC de Poitier?
Some deranged nuns, maybe?

32:45.923 --> 32:49.009
Or was it the Caretaker?
[chuckles]

32:49.927 --> 32:54.515
Find that amusing, Peter?
Grown man torturing little kids?

32:54.598 --> 32:58.102
If there's ghosts in there,
they're the souls of those children

32:58.185 --> 33:01.355
that were ripped away
from everything that they knew,

33:01.438 --> 33:02.940
desperate to get home.

33:03.774 --> 33:04.942
I'm sorry, Bea.

33:07.403 --> 33:08.320
It's a bad joke.

33:16.495 --> 33:18.706
Marc was not killed by a ghost.

33:20.332 --> 33:23.001
He was killed by someone
in that house that night.

33:23.377 --> 33:25.129
All of you didn't go up there

33:25.212 --> 33:28.215
to check up on the place
or because you were curious.

33:28.298 --> 33:31.468
You all went there with a plan
to burn the place down.

33:31.927 --> 33:36.682
But someone had another plan too.
Marc did something.

33:37.433 --> 33:42.980
It made his killer so mad, they couldn't
stand to look at him for another second.

33:46.150 --> 33:49.695
All I've got to do
is find out what that was.

34:04.585 --> 34:06.044
Thank you for inviting us.

36:16.550 --> 36:17.634
[door thuds]

36:18.427 --> 36:20.053
[light sparking]

36:21.680 --> 36:23.307
[gasping]

36:29.396 --> 36:30.981
[screaming]

36:32.065 --> 36:33.775
[gasps]

36:34.610 --> 36:35.444
[Reine-Marie] Armand?

36:36.486 --> 36:38.322
[chuckles softly]

36:39.031 --> 36:41.408
What... What are you doing here?

36:42.951 --> 36:46.413
I thought you had that conference
in Burlington first thing.

36:46.496 --> 36:49.958
I thought I'd break the journey.
Stay the night with you.

36:51.335 --> 36:53.712
-You're checking up on me, aren't you?
-Never.

36:56.298 --> 36:58.383
Well, I'm fine. Really.

36:59.468 --> 37:03.388
-You don't need me to stay then.
-No, no, no. I didn't say that.

37:03.472 --> 37:05.390
[chuckles]

37:06.433 --> 37:09.019
-I certainly didn't say that.
-You didn't?

37:12.230 --> 37:15.108
-I'd never say that.
-I think I'm gonna stay.

37:15.192 --> 37:16.735
I think you'll stay.

37:29.831 --> 37:33.794
-You drive safe now.
-Now you take care. And I mean it.

37:43.762 --> 37:46.139
-[in French] I love you.
-[in French] Me too.

37:52.813 --> 37:54.231
[engine starts]

38:02.572 --> 38:04.574
[bird cawing]

38:32.102 --> 38:33.270
Did you sleep here?

38:33.353 --> 38:34.521
Uh...

38:35.022 --> 38:37.983
Yeah, I was here late, working.

38:38.066 --> 38:40.569
Didn't make sense
driving back to the city.

38:43.780 --> 38:44.614
Morning!

38:46.950 --> 38:47.826
Salut, Beauvy.

38:50.370 --> 38:54.791
-Your breakfast? Trans fats and additives?
-Yeah, and Cheez Doodles for lunch.

38:54.875 --> 38:55.917
Please.

38:56.793 --> 39:02.591
So, all we know for sure is the killer
is either one of the seven villagers

39:02.674 --> 39:06.303
that was up there that night
or some kind of zombie nun.

39:06.386 --> 39:11.475
Don't make jokes, Agent Nichol. We should
all be ashamed of what happened up there.

39:12.851 --> 39:14.978
Okay. Uh...

39:15.062 --> 39:19.775
Marc was born in 1973 to Ida Martel
and Martin Fortier. Both deceased.

39:20.525 --> 39:23.445
Martin Fortier
worked at St Anthony's as a janitor.

39:24.446 --> 39:27.491
Statements from the inquiry
into residential schools

39:27.574 --> 39:30.160
showed many allegations of abuse.
Thank you.

39:32.954 --> 39:37.751
Seventeen survivors reported abuse
from a man they knew as the Caretaker.

39:38.043 --> 39:39.544
The Caretaker was...

39:42.172 --> 39:43.298
Was Martin Fortier.

39:44.382 --> 39:47.636
Hell of a coincidence the son is killed
in the same place

39:47.719 --> 39:49.596
where the dad committed his crimes.

39:49.679 --> 39:52.307
-You think it's revenge?
-Why now?

39:53.809 --> 39:57.896
Marc designed a memorial
for the survivors, the victims.

39:57.979 --> 40:02.984
He raised the money to have it cast,
and his plan was to put it on the green,

40:03.068 --> 40:05.445
-in front of the pines.
-Anyone oppose it?

40:05.529 --> 40:07.364
Yeah, Bea Mayer.

40:07.447 --> 40:11.201
Really? You'd think
she'd appreciate it, right?

40:12.744 --> 40:17.124
I had the syllabics translated.
It's a Cree girl's name.

40:17.833 --> 40:19.459
Piyatapinuhkau.

40:20.710 --> 40:22.295
-Bea?
-Mm-hmm.

40:22.671 --> 40:25.841
Her Cree name,
before they changed it at St. Anthony's.

40:27.259 --> 40:28.635
-Good work, Jean-Guy.
-Yeah.

41:52.594 --> 41:55.263
Did you carve your name
down in that basement?

42:00.143 --> 42:03.647
Means Sunrise Woman.
My grandmother gave me that name.

42:04.439 --> 42:06.358
They left me there for two days.

42:07.275 --> 42:08.652
I was lucky.

42:10.403 --> 42:12.739
Kids got thrown in the trap.

42:13.448 --> 42:16.952
It must be hard for you, being here.

42:17.661 --> 42:19.329
I live with that place.

42:20.914 --> 42:22.582
I see it every day.

42:22.666 --> 42:24.501
Why put yourself through that?

42:24.584 --> 42:26.253
That's how trauma works.

42:26.336 --> 42:30.298
Leaves its mark.
And the more you try to push it away,

42:30.382 --> 42:34.761
the greater control it has over us.
I remember, so I am free.

42:34.844 --> 42:37.973
Confronting your demons
makes you stronger.

42:38.056 --> 42:39.599
What happened to you, Bea?

42:39.683 --> 42:43.436
The day before my fifth birthday,
a priest came. Took me away.

42:43.520 --> 42:46.022
I cried all night for my mother.

42:46.106 --> 42:48.775
In the morning,
there was no birthday cake.

42:48.858 --> 42:51.611
Just whipped,
for the first time in my life.

42:51.695 --> 42:54.906
You want to know the rest, Chief?
Read the report.

42:54.990 --> 42:58.785
Enough of us stood up and told the world
what that place did to us.

42:59.452 --> 43:04.207
The suffering that went on in that place
left its mark on the building.

43:04.582 --> 43:07.335
Real bad energy, man.

43:08.253 --> 43:09.796
Bea, can I ask you...

43:12.507 --> 43:13.842
You remember this man?

43:15.427 --> 43:16.469
I try not to.

43:20.640 --> 43:23.226
-Did you know it was Marc's father?
-Yeah.

43:26.229 --> 43:30.358
And, you know, Marc wanted to build
a memorial for the survivors.

43:30.692 --> 43:35.947
Yeah, I know he wanted,
to make it all about him and his guilt.

43:37.407 --> 43:39.576
Make amends for what his daddy did.

43:40.076 --> 43:43.496
Get himself some closure, neat and tidy.

43:44.122 --> 43:47.250
Some good publicity is a bonus.

43:47.917 --> 43:51.171
User, white saviour bullshit.

43:51.254 --> 43:54.090
It was not his place
to speak on our behalf.

43:54.591 --> 43:58.970
It wasn't his place to speak for us.
He's the last one.

44:07.228 --> 44:08.480
[door closes]

44:12.734 --> 44:16.821
Let's assume Marc's cry came
when he was pushed down the basement.

44:17.572 --> 44:22.285
Olivier, Gabri, Ruth, Myrna, all say
they were upstairs when they heard it.

44:22.369 --> 44:24.913
That leaves us with Clara, Peter, Hayden.

44:24.996 --> 44:28.708
Time how long it'd take to get
from their spot to the others.

44:28.792 --> 44:32.504
-Anyone connected with the school?
-Not that I could find, sir.

44:34.506 --> 44:37.884
Hayden was sure Sophie wasn't there,
but what if she was?

44:37.967 --> 44:39.135
[Gamache] Motive?

44:39.219 --> 44:43.223
Sophie was drinking for a reason.
She's very close to her father.

44:43.306 --> 44:45.558
Maybe Marc moving in messed that up.

44:46.226 --> 44:49.312
-The blind kid?
-She's not blind. She has low vision.

44:49.396 --> 44:51.523
She can find her way in the dark.

44:51.606 --> 44:53.400
There's Clara and Peter.

44:53.483 --> 44:56.820
Things seemed tense
between them at dinner last night.

44:56.903 --> 45:00.573
Clara is the only one we spoke to
who isn't singing Marc's praises.

45:04.369 --> 45:05.995
Looks like Marc had a secret.

45:11.751 --> 45:14.003
We know who that belongs to.

45:15.547 --> 45:17.173
I'm going to stay here.

45:18.550 --> 45:20.677
[duck quacks]

45:33.064 --> 45:34.732
[chuckles]

45:53.751 --> 45:55.253
Okay, okay.

45:58.590 --> 45:59.549
Ooh.

46:27.452 --> 46:28.870
[chuckles]

46:39.172 --> 46:43.968
I have a cabin in the woods.
I go there to write sometimes.

46:44.844 --> 46:46.471
Why did Marc have the key?

46:46.763 --> 46:49.057
He wanted somewhere private to paint.

46:49.807 --> 46:52.185
It was for the best. He was terrible.

46:52.560 --> 46:53.978
Kind of you to help him.

46:54.979 --> 46:56.064
Paid a good price.

46:58.191 --> 46:59.567
I thought he was broke.

47:00.068 --> 47:01.611
How long did he rent it for?

47:02.529 --> 47:03.530
Couple of months.

47:12.914 --> 47:14.791
[groans] Are you cooking that?

47:16.376 --> 47:17.961
She almost didn't make it.

47:18.962 --> 47:22.799
I had to crack the shell
just enough to let her out.

47:27.762 --> 47:30.890
Okay. Aren't they supposed to fight
their own way out?

47:30.974 --> 47:33.351
Build the strength they need to survive?

47:38.231 --> 47:41.609
I'm sure if she couldn't manage it,
you've saved her life.

47:42.860 --> 47:43.695
Okay.

47:50.577 --> 47:55.498
You'll find the cabin there.
Break anything and I'll fucking sue.

47:58.960 --> 47:59.961
Oh.

48:06.968 --> 48:07.927
[Gamache] Thank you, Ruth.

48:12.015 --> 48:12.932
[door opens]

48:14.976 --> 48:16.060
[door closes]

49:01.147 --> 49:05.276
Wasn't Marc supposed to be painting?
I don't see any paint or canvases.

49:06.235 --> 49:07.487
Somebody's been here.

49:16.537 --> 49:17.455
Recently.

49:20.917 --> 49:22.585
-[creaking]
-[shushing]

49:23.753 --> 49:25.088
[Gamache] Something's out there.

50:00.623 --> 50:01.582
[Beauvoir] Someone's there.

50:01.666 --> 50:03.710
Police! Stop!

50:04.252 --> 50:05.628
[Gamache] We're gonna need backup.

50:05.712 --> 50:07.004
[Beauvoir] Stop! Police!

50:35.700 --> 50:36.617
[Beauvoir] Where is he?

50:42.707 --> 50:43.541
[Beauvoir] I see him.

50:47.670 --> 50:48.504
Stop!

51:08.649 --> 51:10.860
[speaking French]

51:12.320 --> 51:15.323
Show me your hands! Hands above your head!

51:17.200 --> 51:21.037
Okay, put your hands over your head.
Show me your hands!

51:22.163 --> 51:25.708
Over your head.
Put your hands over your head!

51:26.793 --> 51:27.627
Turn around.

51:38.221 --> 51:39.138
[Gamache] Peter Morrow.

51:39.806 --> 51:41.891
[panting]

51:44.560 --> 51:46.562
[closing theme music playing]
