WEBVTT

00:08.092 --> 00:09.927
[soulful rock music]

00:12.972 --> 00:15.266
[Camille] They say if you
don't learn from the past,

00:15.266 --> 00:17.059
you're bound to repeat it.

00:17.059 --> 00:19.103
Inherent in that expression
is the assumption

00:19.103 --> 00:21.021
that repeating history is bad,

00:21.021 --> 00:22.398
something to avoid.

00:25.526 --> 00:28.279
However, here,
in the Harlem of today,

00:28.279 --> 00:31.532
anthropologists tell us
that by learning who we were,

00:31.532 --> 00:34.869
what the city was, we might
get lucky enough to repeat it.

00:34.869 --> 00:36.871
Now, how you gonna be
a freelance palm reader?

00:36.871 --> 00:38.289
- [chuckles] It's possible.
[Nikki] No business.

00:38.289 --> 00:40.082
Should I try right now?

00:40.082 --> 00:43.335
Ooh, now, this is a Saturn
aspect on your lifeline...

00:43.335 --> 00:45.087
very powerful stuff.

00:45.087 --> 00:46.797
Ooh.

00:46.797 --> 00:50.134
But a big mistake is coming
back right to get you.

00:50.134 --> 00:53.179
The mistake was agreeing
to pay you for this bullshit.

00:53.179 --> 00:56.474
[scoffs] You know, hostility
is like the new smoking.

00:56.474 --> 00:57.808
You only hurting yourself.

00:57.808 --> 00:59.435
Whatever.

00:59.435 --> 01:01.812
Anyway, ladies, would anyone
else like a palm reading?

01:01.812 --> 01:03.773
[both] No.

01:03.773 --> 01:05.316
Namaste.

01:05.316 --> 01:07.777
Nama-don't stay.
Namast-go.

01:07.777 --> 01:09.361
[laughs]

01:09.361 --> 01:11.071
I must have
one of those, too.

01:11.071 --> 01:12.865
A broke-ass cousin
who makes up nonsense?

01:12.865 --> 01:15.659
No, a past mistake
coming back.

01:15.659 --> 01:17.161
Ian was at the club.

01:17.161 --> 01:18.662
What? Tonight?

01:18.662 --> 01:20.164
And you're just now
saying something?

01:20.164 --> 01:22.792
I spent three plates of rice
and beans listening to Quinn

01:22.792 --> 01:24.668
rank the Jonas Brothers.

01:24.668 --> 01:26.504
You couldn't have cut in
with that information?

01:26.504 --> 01:29.340
Saturn must really want
you two to be together.

01:29.340 --> 01:32.092
Well, my apologies to Saturn.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.844
I got this close to him.

01:33.844 --> 01:36.388
No, I just...
I lost all my nerve.

01:36.388 --> 01:39.391
[steady music]

01:43.020 --> 01:45.189
[glass shatters]

01:47.233 --> 01:49.819
[clears throat]
Wow, she's good.

01:54.198 --> 01:56.742
He wasn't supposed to be there.
He threw me off my whole shit.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.411
Four years later, and that
nigga still has a hold on you.

01:59.411 --> 02:01.330
That's some serious
dick energy right there.

02:01.330 --> 02:02.456
What's dick energy?

02:02.456 --> 02:04.500
How is it I know
and you don't?

02:04.500 --> 02:06.961
It's when a man's stroke
is so enchanting

02:06.961 --> 02:08.379
that the ghost of his penis

02:08.379 --> 02:10.464
sort of haunts your vagina
like an old house.

02:10.464 --> 02:12.716
Oh, I guess I haven't had
that pleasure.

02:12.716 --> 02:15.052
Well, I sling serious
dick energy,

02:15.052 --> 02:16.554
and I don't even have one.

02:16.554 --> 02:19.640
You are so nas...
Stop doing that at the table!

02:19.640 --> 02:21.433
I am not this woman!

02:21.433 --> 02:23.102
I don't run from an ex.

02:23.102 --> 02:24.562
I'm the "tell your followers

02:24.562 --> 02:26.897
to be brave
and face their fears" woman.

02:26.897 --> 02:28.941
Yeah, but to run
into Ian like that?

02:28.941 --> 02:30.943
In all of the bars
in New York...

02:30.943 --> 02:33.529
No, no,
this has to be a sign.

02:33.529 --> 02:35.739
Or signs are woo-woo bullshit,

02:35.739 --> 02:37.658
and her ex is
just in town visiting.

02:37.658 --> 02:39.034
No, wait.
That's what it is.

02:39.034 --> 02:40.452
Paul and Brittany's
engagement party.

02:40.452 --> 02:41.996
That's why he's in town.

02:41.996 --> 02:44.206
We're the ones who introduced
them in the first place.

02:44.206 --> 02:46.292
And now they're engaged?

02:46.292 --> 02:48.127
Why don't you ever introduce me
to anybody?

02:48.127 --> 02:50.379
Baby, the thirst is real.

02:50.379 --> 02:53.465
It was actually
supposed to be a joke.

02:53.465 --> 02:55.259
They are the corniest friends
that we have,

02:55.259 --> 02:57.344
and Ian thought it would be
funny to go on a double date,

02:57.344 --> 02:59.847
And it turns out
that corny gets corny.

02:59.847 --> 03:02.308
If Ian's going, then
I'm coming down with the flu.

03:02.308 --> 03:04.518
Says Mrs. Don't Run Away
From An Ex.

03:04.518 --> 03:05.686
Mm.

03:05.686 --> 03:07.146
Well, I can't be black
girl magic all the time.

03:07.146 --> 03:08.063
[Tye chuckles]

03:08.063 --> 03:09.815
- Hello!
- Hi!

03:09.815 --> 03:11.650
So good!

03:11.650 --> 03:13.319
I'm sorry!

03:13.319 --> 03:15.237
So? Who was he?

03:15.237 --> 03:17.573
A producer!

03:17.573 --> 03:20.618
I told you that open-mic night
was gonna be good.

03:20.618 --> 03:23.329
- "Brothers Pictures."
- Black owned?

03:23.329 --> 03:26.290
And he said they have
a major project "in the works"

03:26.290 --> 03:28.334
and he wants me to come
to their offices tomorrow.

03:28.334 --> 03:30.252
- Aah!
- Holy shit!

03:30.252 --> 03:33.088
- That's my girl!
- That's me, that's me.

03:33.088 --> 03:35.549
You see? I knew it.
Your dream is coming true!

03:35.549 --> 03:37.760
It's like the great
Lady Gaga once said,

03:37.760 --> 03:39.386
"You can get 99 nos"...

03:39.386 --> 03:40.429
I'm gonna stop you
right there!

03:40.429 --> 03:42.723
[both] Thank you.

03:42.723 --> 03:43.807
Waiter!

03:43.807 --> 03:46.143
[smooth music]

03:46.143 --> 03:48.896
Tye, I appreciate
the chivalry,

03:48.896 --> 03:50.731
but we passed your place
two stops ago.

03:50.731 --> 03:52.316
Three.

03:52.316 --> 03:55.027
I just want to make sure you're
really okay about seeing Ian.

03:55.027 --> 03:57.529
Yes.
That was a long time ago.

03:57.529 --> 03:59.323
I'm fine...
I just don't see the upside

03:59.323 --> 04:01.033
of hanging with him
at some wack party.

04:01.033 --> 04:03.661
Ian's, like, the one thing
that can get you all...

04:03.661 --> 04:05.663
Why?
[crying]

04:05.663 --> 04:08.415
[melancholy music]

04:09.959 --> 04:11.961
That was a long time ago, okay?

04:11.961 --> 04:15.589
I appreciate the concern,
but I am fine.

04:15.589 --> 04:17.174
[sighs] It's just all
these years later,

04:17.174 --> 04:18.676
are we really still
talking about Ian?

04:18.676 --> 04:19.927
Not if you don't want to.

04:19.927 --> 04:21.470
I don't, so let's talk
about anything else.

04:21.470 --> 04:23.013
- Got it.
- Yeah.

04:23.013 --> 04:27.351
Well, I found out
my Forbes interview

04:27.351 --> 04:30.562
has turned
into a two-page spread.

04:30.562 --> 04:32.356
- What?
- Photo shoot and everything!

04:32.356 --> 04:33.524
Tye, really?

04:33.524 --> 04:35.067
Really.

04:35.067 --> 04:38.612
A queer woman of color in tech
is going to be in Forbes.

04:38.612 --> 04:40.322
Yes!
All those words.

04:40.322 --> 04:42.241
If I was the kind of person
that said corny things

04:42.241 --> 04:45.828
about how far I've come,
I'd say one right now.

04:45.828 --> 04:47.955
So how are things
on the Shayla front?

04:47.955 --> 04:49.790
Done.
That's a wrap.

04:49.790 --> 04:52.167
What?
That was quick even for you.

04:52.167 --> 04:54.378
[scoffs] The problem is
we work in the same building,

04:54.378 --> 04:56.338
- so I can't just ghost her.
- Oh.

04:56.338 --> 04:57.798
I have to do that thing

04:57.798 --> 04:59.758
where I break up with myself
for her.

04:59.758 --> 05:00.843
Mm.

05:00.843 --> 05:02.219
I get it.

05:02.219 --> 05:04.430
But I just need
to work on myself

05:04.430 --> 05:05.973
so that I can only hope

05:05.973 --> 05:09.601
to one day be good enough
for you.

05:11.103 --> 05:13.814
[laughter]

05:13.814 --> 05:16.233
That's good, though...
face-to-face breakup.

05:16.233 --> 05:18.777
Look at you,
giving up your fuckboi degree.

05:18.777 --> 05:21.238
what I'm talking about!

05:21.238 --> 05:23.699
[both grunting goofily]

05:23.699 --> 05:27.619
Over time, the culture
of a place evolves

05:27.619 --> 05:30.706
as new people
and new ideas move in.

05:30.706 --> 05:33.542
But the question is...

05:33.542 --> 05:35.419
how much of the past

05:35.419 --> 05:38.547
should be
respectfully preserved?

05:38.547 --> 05:41.050
And how much
should be discarded

05:41.050 --> 05:43.177
in order to evolve?

05:43.177 --> 05:46.096
Upload your essays
by tomorrow night.

05:46.096 --> 05:47.473
I'll see you next week.

05:57.066 --> 05:59.026
Amazing lecture,
Professor Parks.

05:59.026 --> 06:01.278
Top ten of the semester.

06:01.278 --> 06:02.613
No, top five...
top three.

06:02.613 --> 06:03.947
Thank you, Nora.

06:03.947 --> 06:05.449
How do you do it?

06:05.449 --> 06:07.826
Uh... [chuckles]
Thank you again, Nora.

06:07.826 --> 06:09.661
No, literally,
how do you do it?

06:09.661 --> 06:12.456
- How much is prep...
[Robin] Camille! Camille!

06:12.456 --> 06:14.291
Jemele Hill and the other
panelists just arrived

06:14.291 --> 06:15.375
for the woman's rally.

06:15.375 --> 06:17.211
You gonna drop by?

06:17.211 --> 06:19.463
Watch my speech,
join the pithy chants.

06:19.463 --> 06:21.799
- [door closes]
- I'm definitely gonna try.

06:21.799 --> 06:23.467
That means definitely no.

06:23.467 --> 06:26.303
Oh, Dr. Goodman,
I'm going to the rally.

06:26.303 --> 06:27.429
I'll walk with you.

06:27.429 --> 06:28.889
Definitely try.

06:32.059 --> 06:33.477
[door closes]

06:41.443 --> 06:43.153
Camille?

06:43.153 --> 06:45.239
- [gasps]
- Oh, my God, Brittany!

06:45.239 --> 06:46.698
Hi!

06:46.698 --> 06:48.826
- You're still going to Tony?
- Yes, every two weeks.

06:48.826 --> 06:50.702
I can't believe
you introduced me

06:50.702 --> 06:53.080
to my future husband
and my stylist.

06:53.080 --> 06:55.040
[chuckles] Well, don't you owe
me a finder's fee?

06:55.040 --> 06:58.127
Anything, girl.
And half goes to Ian.

06:58.127 --> 06:59.211
Sorry.

06:59.211 --> 07:01.338
Oh, God.
Sorry.

07:01.338 --> 07:03.048
I shouldn't have mentioned Ian.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.217
Don't be crazy.
It's fine. We're fine.

07:05.217 --> 07:06.802
- Oh, good.
- Yeah.

07:06.802 --> 07:08.929
Because I was so worried
you'd do something silly

07:08.929 --> 07:11.765
like not show up to my party
to avoid seeing him.

07:11.765 --> 07:13.100
- [chuckles]
- No, what am I, 12?

07:13.100 --> 07:14.893
- No!
- No.

07:14.893 --> 07:16.353
Yes, of course I'm coming,
you know?

07:16.353 --> 07:18.230
- I-I'm dying to come.
- Oh, good.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.149
Like, literally nothing but
death would keep me from it,

07:20.149 --> 07:22.067
and even if I do die,
I want them to dump

07:22.067 --> 07:23.277
my dead body
at that damn party.

07:23.277 --> 07:25.070
- [laughs]
- Don't make it weird.

07:25.070 --> 07:27.197
- Copy that.
- Mm-hmm.

07:27.197 --> 07:30.826
Sister Angie, Queen Angie,
I'm Cole Thompson.

07:30.826 --> 07:32.703
And welcome
to Brother Pictures.

07:32.703 --> 07:35.038
Mm-hmm.
It's nice to meet you.

07:35.038 --> 07:36.165
We are a collective

07:36.165 --> 07:38.292
of Black artists
for Black audiences...

07:38.292 --> 07:39.543
Mm.

07:39.543 --> 07:41.753
Working across the entire
African diaspora,

07:41.753 --> 07:43.755
looking to educate and inspire.

07:43.755 --> 07:45.257
Mm.

07:45.257 --> 07:48.886
The Black voice
will no longer be asphyxiated

07:48.886 --> 07:52.848
by the transmutation
to the Eurocentric perspective.

07:52.848 --> 07:55.309
So...
is it a movie?

07:55.309 --> 07:57.186
It's a revolution!

07:57.186 --> 07:58.979
The Black story will be told

07:58.979 --> 08:01.857
by the Black voice
through a Black gaze.

08:01.857 --> 08:04.318
Okay, hold up.
You're using a lot of words.

08:04.318 --> 08:06.320
You trying to Hotep me
into doing porn?

08:06.320 --> 08:07.321
- No!
- Okay, good.

08:07.321 --> 08:08.906
'Cause I been there,
and I done that.

08:08.906 --> 08:10.574
Yeah, me too.

08:10.574 --> 08:14.953
It's a new dawn where we dare
to free ourselves

08:14.953 --> 08:17.080
from the white man's
story construct

08:17.080 --> 08:19.041
and define a new art.

08:19.041 --> 08:22.294
- Mm.
- A true Black art.

08:22.294 --> 08:25.589
- That's what's up.
- My sister, are you ready

08:25.589 --> 08:28.926
to be part of something
that's about something?

08:28.926 --> 08:32.262
Okay, yes.
So what we doing?

08:32.262 --> 08:35.057
It's Get Out,
the musical...

08:35.057 --> 08:37.226
on Broadway.

08:37.226 --> 08:40.062
Yeah.

08:40.062 --> 08:41.688
I told
that emancipated nigga,

08:41.688 --> 08:43.023
"Hell fucking no."

08:43.023 --> 08:45.442
Oh, my God, Angie.
Customer.

08:45.442 --> 08:47.361
Sorry.

08:47.361 --> 08:49.905
I said, "No, thank you,"
to that emancipated nigga.

08:49.905 --> 08:51.114
I cannot believe

08:51.114 --> 08:53.283
that you're turning down
a potential singing job.

08:53.283 --> 08:55.452
I can't believe that you would
think that I would say yes

08:55.452 --> 08:58.997
to singing in the chorus
of a Get Out musical?

08:58.997 --> 09:00.791
Is that the best you think
that I can get?

09:00.791 --> 09:03.168
You know, thanks,
for the vote of confidence.

09:03.168 --> 09:04.169
Whoa.

09:04.169 --> 09:05.420
Okay, How did your job offer

09:05.420 --> 09:06.838
somehow turn into my fault?

09:06.838 --> 09:08.465
And please don't eat there.

09:08.465 --> 09:10.259
Employees need a break room.

09:10.259 --> 09:12.135
Employees need to work.

09:12.135 --> 09:14.054
[door rattles open]

09:14.054 --> 09:16.932
Oh, my God!

09:16.932 --> 09:18.642
Retro-chic!

09:18.642 --> 09:20.185
Oh, my God, I am dead!

09:20.185 --> 09:22.479
Oh, my God!
I'm dead!

09:22.479 --> 09:24.606
- Angie, are you not dead?
- Yeah, dead.

09:24.606 --> 09:26.650
Oh, my gosh.
You look amazing!

09:26.650 --> 09:28.485
And the proceeds
from your purchase

09:28.485 --> 09:30.654
will go to feed
four homeless New Yorkers.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.115
So it's like a splurge
without the guilt.

09:33.115 --> 09:35.492
I need to think about it.

09:35.492 --> 09:36.868
It's a dress, not a house.

09:36.868 --> 09:37.911
Angie.

09:39.079 --> 09:41.665
She's joking.
She's joking.

09:41.665 --> 09:43.750
[laughs]

09:43.750 --> 09:45.877
Can you not insult
the customers?

09:45.877 --> 09:47.004
She is not a customer.

09:47.004 --> 09:48.505
She's a "needs
to think about it."

09:48.505 --> 09:49.923
- [sighs]
- She comes in here

09:49.923 --> 09:52.342
three, four, five times a week
just looking at shit.

09:52.342 --> 09:54.386
She a professional
window shopper.

09:54.386 --> 09:56.096
Shit! Shit!

09:56.096 --> 09:58.515
Girl, if that's the Amex bill,
I can explain.

09:58.515 --> 10:01.727
No, no, the landlord
is jacking the rent again.

10:01.727 --> 10:03.145
Did you take my Amex?

10:03.145 --> 10:04.896
Girl, don't stress yourself out
about that

10:04.896 --> 10:06.565
with that new rent news.

10:06.565 --> 10:09.151
Oh, my God,
another $2,500 a month?

10:09.151 --> 10:12.195
I'm barely
covering it as it is.

10:12.195 --> 10:15.324
I cannot ask my parents
for more money.

10:15.324 --> 10:17.951
Okay, you just try to sell
some more stuff around here.

10:17.951 --> 10:20.495
I don't literally try
to do that every single day?

10:20.495 --> 10:22.372
Okay, you are using
your cunt voice.

10:22.372 --> 10:24.041
[sighs]
Sorry. Sorry.

10:24.041 --> 10:25.250
It's okay.

10:25.250 --> 10:27.044
[sighs] It's just
that it's not just asking

10:27.044 --> 10:28.337
my parents for more money.

10:28.337 --> 10:30.964
It's that "poor you" look
on my mom's face

10:30.964 --> 10:35.802
and followed by the obligatory
"you need a husband" lecture.

10:35.802 --> 10:37.596
God, like I forgot
I was single?

10:37.596 --> 10:40.557
- Mm-hmm.
- Thanks for the reminder, Mom.

10:40.557 --> 10:43.143
No, I'm not gonna do it.
I'm not gonna ask her.

10:43.143 --> 10:45.145
I won't.

10:45.145 --> 10:46.730
I agree.

10:48.565 --> 10:51.360
Except I have no choice
but to ask her.

10:51.360 --> 10:53.153
And again, I agree.

10:55.280 --> 10:57.491
[Quinn] Okay, let's make
this meal quick.

10:57.491 --> 10:59.743
I'll get the check,
and we get out.

10:59.743 --> 11:02.788
Okay, it is your money.
Who are all those people?

11:02.788 --> 11:05.207
Our tense family dinner
is now a party?

11:05.207 --> 11:06.625
Quinn!

11:06.625 --> 11:09.586
What a casually dressed
surprise.

11:09.586 --> 11:11.588
- Angela.
- Hey, Ms. Pat.

11:11.588 --> 11:13.715
Daddy said it would be just us.

11:13.715 --> 11:15.384
Oh, he's still stuck
at the office.

11:15.384 --> 11:17.636
He didn't tell you that
we're hosting a fundraiser?

11:17.636 --> 11:20.138
No. I definitely would
have remembered that.

11:20.138 --> 11:22.182
Quinn.

11:22.182 --> 11:23.517
Oh, my God.
Is that Damien?

11:23.517 --> 11:25.185
That is definitely Damien.

11:25.185 --> 11:27.771
- He looks so good.
- Girl, you messed up.

11:27.771 --> 11:29.731
- Good to see you.
- You too.

11:29.731 --> 11:31.608
Oh, that's right.
You two know each other.

11:31.608 --> 11:34.194
Only from the entire year
that we dated, Mom.

11:34.194 --> 11:37.114
Well, say hello
to his wife, Tina.

11:37.114 --> 11:39.574
Oh, nice to...

11:39.574 --> 11:41.910
meet the both of you!

11:41.910 --> 11:43.286
[laughs]

11:43.286 --> 11:46.039
Wow! The two of you.
[laughs]

11:46.039 --> 11:49.084
You look so... happy.
You're so happy.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.128
Everybody's happy!

11:51.128 --> 11:52.421
[laughs] I'm gonna go now.

11:52.421 --> 11:55.590
No, you're here now.
You must meet Isabela.

11:55.590 --> 11:56.800
Quinn.

11:56.800 --> 11:58.593
Your mom has told me
so much about you.

11:58.593 --> 12:00.929
Mm.
Any of it positive?

12:00.929 --> 12:03.473
Quinn, this is
Isabela Benítez-Santiago.

12:03.473 --> 12:05.016
She will beat AOC's record

12:05.016 --> 12:06.726
as the youngest member
of Congress.

12:06.726 --> 12:08.228
Um, I've got to win first,
but...

12:08.228 --> 12:10.856
Details.
Isabela's an advocate

12:10.856 --> 12:13.191
for people of color
and poor people

12:13.191 --> 12:16.111
and poor people of color,
very intersectional.

12:16.111 --> 12:19.072
I think she would make
a wonderful mentor for you.

12:19.072 --> 12:21.283
Great.
I was literally just saying

12:21.283 --> 12:25.454
how much I needed a mentor
who was much younger.

12:25.454 --> 12:27.664
So you said you have something
to talk about.

12:29.374 --> 12:31.251
Uh, well...

12:31.251 --> 12:32.836
Oh, Quinn's business
is failing,

12:32.836 --> 12:34.379
and she needs money fast.

12:34.379 --> 12:36.131
- Thank you.
- I'm sorry, girl.

12:36.131 --> 12:39.634
I can't think.
Hot Damien has a pregnant wife.

12:39.634 --> 12:40.886
[chuckles angrily]

12:40.886 --> 12:44.473
Just a splash more gin.
Uh-uh, big splash.

12:44.473 --> 12:46.141
Pour it! Pour it!
Pour it! Pour it!

12:46.141 --> 12:47.851
Don't be greedy.
It's not yours, come on.

12:47.851 --> 12:49.895
For the love of God,
just give her the whole bottle.

12:49.895 --> 12:51.855
Oh, thanks, Mrs. J!

12:51.855 --> 12:54.024
All right, so how much?

12:54.024 --> 12:56.276
[clears throat] Well,
it's just that the landlord

12:56.276 --> 12:59.654
is suddenly raising
the rent again, so...

12:59.654 --> 13:00.989
$2,500.

13:02.657 --> 13:04.868
Just a loving thought, dear...

13:04.868 --> 13:07.871
instead of me giving you money
to keep your business afloat

13:07.871 --> 13:10.665
and then you turn around
and give that money to charity,

13:10.665 --> 13:12.292
why don't we just cut out
the middleman,

13:12.292 --> 13:14.211
and I write you a check
for your charity?

13:14.211 --> 13:16.463
But I'm a designer, Mom.

13:16.463 --> 13:18.423
Of course you are.

13:18.423 --> 13:21.676
But your father and I cannot be
your only paying customers.

13:21.676 --> 13:22.886
You're not.

13:22.886 --> 13:25.889
I just need a little more
seed money, and then...

13:25.889 --> 13:27.766
And then and then and then...

13:27.766 --> 13:29.726
Poor Quinn.

13:29.726 --> 13:31.520
Now not so poor Quinn.

13:34.814 --> 13:36.650
Damn, Quinn.

13:36.650 --> 13:39.110
[sighs] The car is still
nine minutes away.

13:39.110 --> 13:41.446
Mm.
I hope he's cute.

13:41.446 --> 13:44.366
Did I tell you
I blew my last Uber driver?

13:44.366 --> 13:46.034
Yes, you did.

13:46.034 --> 13:47.619
[laughter]

13:47.619 --> 13:49.329
God, she's insufferable.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.915
True, but she also wrote you
a check.

13:51.915 --> 13:53.542
With contempt...
that is not a woman

13:53.542 --> 13:55.252
who is happily supporting
her daughter.

13:55.252 --> 13:56.670
Yeah, but you got it.

13:56.670 --> 13:58.922
And anytime someone
gives you something for free,

13:58.922 --> 14:02.217
you pay in listening
to their shit about it.

14:02.217 --> 14:05.595
And, sweetie, there are
harder ways to earn $2,500.

14:05.595 --> 14:07.764
[sighs]
I know, I know.

14:07.764 --> 14:11.017
And I recognize my privilege.
I do, and I am grateful for it.

14:11.017 --> 14:13.353
It's just, why has she always
got to be such a fucking...

14:13.353 --> 14:15.522
- Here's the real party.
- Oh!

14:15.522 --> 14:17.566
Hi. It was really great
to meet you tonight.

14:17.566 --> 14:20.902
You are almost worth risking
jury duty to register to vote.

14:20.902 --> 14:23.154
It's nice to meet you, too.

14:23.154 --> 14:24.823
And your mom is so cool.

14:24.823 --> 14:26.116
[both]
Eh...

14:26.116 --> 14:27.909
She raised a lot of money
for me tonight.

14:27.909 --> 14:29.786
Oh, well, that's because
she really believes

14:29.786 --> 14:32.747
in what it is you're trying
to do, and that must be nice,

14:32.747 --> 14:35.917
because I never seem to live up
to her expectations, so...

14:35.917 --> 14:38.420
- Mm.
- That must suck.

14:38.420 --> 14:40.255
But I guess a good part
of coming from nothing

14:40.255 --> 14:43.592
is no one
ever expects anything, so...

14:43.592 --> 14:45.385
Let's agree
to fuck expectations

14:45.385 --> 14:46.928
and just accept each other.

14:46.928 --> 14:49.306
Ooh, my Uber's here.
Ciao, ladies.

14:50.515 --> 14:52.684
She really does make
a wonderful mentor.

14:52.684 --> 14:54.978
- [cell phone vibrates]
- Car.

14:54.978 --> 14:58.189
Ooh, if he's cute,
do not cock-block me.

14:58.189 --> 15:01.067
[upbeat music]

15:06.364 --> 15:08.617
Mmm.
That's some good wine.

15:10.994 --> 15:13.455
- Hey.
- Shayla, hi.

15:13.455 --> 15:15.582
I actually have a meeting
in a few, so...

15:15.582 --> 15:17.208
Oh, I do, too.

15:17.208 --> 15:20.086
So let's just get into this.

15:20.086 --> 15:23.214
You are an amazing,

15:23.214 --> 15:25.884
intelligent,
phenomenal woman.

15:25.884 --> 15:27.427
Look, let me
stop you right there,

15:27.427 --> 15:29.679
because you're the one
who's phenomenal.

15:29.679 --> 15:32.849
But I agree.
You deserve someone better.

15:32.849 --> 15:34.684
- I-it's not you.
- It's me.

15:34.684 --> 15:37.020
- And I really just need to...
- Work on myself.

15:37.020 --> 15:38.396
[both]
And it seems we're just...

15:38.396 --> 15:41.524
On two different paths
right now.

15:41.524 --> 15:44.402
Wait. Are you trying
to break up with me?

15:44.402 --> 15:46.196
It's gonna be okay.

15:46.196 --> 15:50.533
You're obviously not happy,
and you deserve someone better.

15:50.533 --> 15:52.994
No, you're obviously
not happy,

15:52.994 --> 15:55.246
and you deserve someone better.

15:55.246 --> 15:56.956
This is my move.
I do this.

15:56.956 --> 15:58.500
You're better off without me.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.251
No. No, no.
No, no, no, no, no.

16:00.251 --> 16:03.380
I'm being selfless
by letting you live without me.

16:03.380 --> 16:05.799
I'm the one breaking up
with myself for you.

16:05.799 --> 16:08.385
But are you, though?

16:08.385 --> 16:09.594
Oh, nuh-uh, no.

16:09.594 --> 16:12.180
Hey, you don't get to make me
the thirsty one.

16:12.180 --> 16:13.932
No one said "thirsty."

16:13.932 --> 16:15.600
Come on, now,
you're better than this.

16:15.600 --> 16:18.395
No! I'm not better than this!
You are!

16:18.395 --> 16:21.523
- Goodbye.
- You goodbye. You goodbye!

16:21.523 --> 16:24.442
Ciao! Poof! Be gone!

16:24.442 --> 16:25.694
[sighs]
Poor Tye.

16:25.694 --> 16:28.279
I'm sorry you are taking this
so hard.

16:28.279 --> 16:29.781
Ah!

16:31.116 --> 16:35.120
[stammering]
I broke up with her!

16:35.120 --> 16:37.747
Girl, who cares
who said it first?

16:37.747 --> 16:39.374
You wanted to break up
with her anyway!

16:39.374 --> 16:43.503
But that was my move!
Fuck Shayla!

16:43.503 --> 16:46.381
Actually,
fuck anybody but Shayla.

16:46.381 --> 16:47.924
[Angie]
Now, you know what they say.

16:47.924 --> 16:49.801
The best way to get over
old pussy is new pussy.

16:49.801 --> 16:50.927
Mm-hmm.

16:50.927 --> 16:53.096
But, Angie,
maybe they should stop

16:53.096 --> 16:54.639
objectifying women as pussy.

16:54.639 --> 16:55.890
I'm just saying.

16:55.890 --> 16:59.269
It's 2021!
Women are the new men.

16:59.269 --> 17:01.312
Does that mean you all will
stop returning my texts, too?

17:01.312 --> 17:02.939
[laughter]

17:02.939 --> 17:04.774
Listen, I'm just trying
to get my confidence back.

17:04.774 --> 17:07.318
I'm gonna find me a piece,
smash her,

17:07.318 --> 17:09.863
then smash my two-day-old
beef and broccoli.

17:09.863 --> 17:12.782
- [laughter]
- I've aged it perfectly.

17:12.782 --> 17:16.536
Ooh, and speaking
of aged perfectly...

17:16.536 --> 17:17.746
Ooh-wee!

17:17.746 --> 17:20.749
[club music playing]

17:24.753 --> 17:26.004
Mm, mm, mm.

17:26.004 --> 17:27.505
[Tye]
Hey, sexy.

17:27.505 --> 17:29.591
Hey, sexy, yourself.

17:29.591 --> 17:30.842
[Quinn]
And here we are...

17:30.842 --> 17:33.720
three straight girls
who could be somewhere else.

17:33.720 --> 17:35.430
And where do you have to be?

17:35.430 --> 17:38.183
It is Hometowns
on The Bachelorette tonight.

17:38.183 --> 17:40.602
Girl, why would you not lie
and make up something cool?

17:40.602 --> 17:41.686
Damn!

17:41.686 --> 17:43.438
Oh, my God,
she always does this.

17:43.438 --> 17:44.689
Look at her go!

17:44.689 --> 17:46.775
Every time we come with her
to a gay club,

17:46.775 --> 17:48.860
she always swears
that she's gonna ride or die.

17:48.860 --> 17:50.361
- Oh, she gonna ride.
- Mm.

17:50.361 --> 17:53.740
Jesus, it take me longer
to order McDonald's.

17:53.740 --> 17:55.992
Ooh, who want's McDonald's?

18:02.081 --> 18:04.375
can you handle that?

18:08.880 --> 18:10.507
I never do this
on the first night.

18:10.507 --> 18:13.593
Me either, baby,
but you're special.

18:13.593 --> 18:14.511
Oh. Really?

18:14.511 --> 18:16.304
Yeah.
Focus.

18:43.206 --> 18:45.208
[chuckles]

18:53.049 --> 18:56.469
Hello...

18:56.469 --> 18:59.597
Amy?

18:59.597 --> 19:01.641
Allison?

19:01.641 --> 19:03.643
What was her name?

19:05.353 --> 19:07.355
Babe...

19:11.651 --> 19:13.653
No.

19:13.653 --> 19:17.574
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

19:17.574 --> 19:20.660
Yo, did this bitch
eat my beef and broccoli

19:20.660 --> 19:21.870
and bounce?

19:23.246 --> 19:25.248
What the fuck?

19:25.248 --> 19:27.041
Aah!

19:31.880 --> 19:33.172
Hi, Ian.

19:33.172 --> 19:34.549
Ian, right?

19:34.549 --> 19:35.675
Hi, Ian.

19:35.675 --> 19:36.801
[sultry voice]
Hi, Ian.

19:36.801 --> 19:38.970
[deep voice]
Hi, Ian.

19:41.723 --> 19:44.517
[giggles]
Hi, Ian.

19:44.517 --> 19:45.602
Hello.

19:45.602 --> 19:48.396
Greetings.
How's cooking school?

19:48.396 --> 19:50.106
I hope it was worth it.
[laughs]

19:50.106 --> 19:52.609
I hope it was worth it.

19:52.609 --> 19:55.403
What's good, my nigga?
What's good, my nigga?

19:55.403 --> 19:59.490
I'm doing very well, baby.
[laughing and crying]

19:59.490 --> 20:01.409
I'm not doing that well.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.372
Oh, Ian, what's up?

20:06.372 --> 20:08.708
Hey!

20:11.252 --> 20:13.129
Hey, Ian.
What's up?

20:13.129 --> 20:16.132
[cell phone vibrating]

20:18.718 --> 20:21.304
Hey, Robin.

20:21.304 --> 20:24.307
I can't. I have this
party thing I have to go to.

20:26.517 --> 20:28.561
One drink, sure.

20:31.314 --> 20:32.148
[grunts]

20:34.567 --> 20:36.736
I see somebody
got the party started.

20:36.736 --> 20:38.321
Hey.

20:38.321 --> 20:41.574
You like tequila?
I like tequila.

20:41.574 --> 20:43.534
Mm. Mm, mm.

20:43.534 --> 20:45.370
Ah.
Oh, is that for me?

20:45.370 --> 20:46.955
Oh, no.

20:46.955 --> 20:49.290
I have to go to this
engagement party afterwards.

20:49.290 --> 20:50.541
Oh, that's sweet.

20:50.541 --> 20:52.085
Hey, bartender.

20:52.085 --> 20:53.711
- Another one, now. Yeah. Yeah.
[bartender] Okay.

20:53.711 --> 20:54.754
Coming right up.

20:54.754 --> 20:56.172
Wait, wait, wait, wait.

20:56.172 --> 20:58.174
Are we finally celebrating?

20:58.174 --> 20:59.342
Are these the drinks

20:59.342 --> 21:01.010
when you tell me
I'm officially full-time?

21:01.010 --> 21:03.179
In which case, this overpriced
glass bowl is for you.

21:03.179 --> 21:04.389
[bartender]
Here you go.

21:04.389 --> 21:05.932
These are the drinks
where I tell you

21:05.932 --> 21:08.351
that I just got suspended.

21:08.351 --> 21:09.978
I'm out!

21:09.978 --> 21:12.188
Wait, what?

21:12.188 --> 21:14.357
- More shots, please.
- [bartender] Coming right up.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.193
- Wait. What happened?
- Mm.

21:17.193 --> 21:18.778
The future happened.

21:18.778 --> 21:21.447
But instead of flying cars
and vacations to the Moon,

21:21.447 --> 21:23.199
we got trigger warnings

21:23.199 --> 21:25.743
and the return
of cloth diapers.

21:25.743 --> 21:29.330
Okay, I'm not following.
Why did they suspend you?

21:29.330 --> 21:32.000
Because of what I said
at the rally yesterday.

21:32.000 --> 21:33.209
Or sort of said.

21:33.209 --> 21:35.712
I was talking
about how abortion isn't new.

21:35.712 --> 21:37.213
There's always been ways

21:37.213 --> 21:39.757
that women have controlled
their ability to reproduce.

21:39.757 --> 21:42.885
And someone shouts out,
"Not all women can reproduce!"

21:42.885 --> 21:45.805
And I said,
"I mean biological women!"

21:45.805 --> 21:47.223
Then someone shouts back,

21:47.223 --> 21:49.642
"Biology's
a Western construct!"

21:49.642 --> 21:52.311
And I don't know what the fuck
they're talking about.

21:52.311 --> 21:55.732
All of a sudden, I'm in
a debate about what is a woman,

21:55.732 --> 21:56.899
what is not a woman,

21:56.899 --> 21:58.234
which has nothing to do

21:58.234 --> 22:00.319
with the speech
that I was trying to make.

22:00.319 --> 22:03.406
And then the Trans-women
of America Association

22:03.406 --> 22:06.743
sends out this statement that
I should be publicly censured

22:06.743 --> 22:08.327
for saying
they weren't real women.

22:08.327 --> 22:10.621
And then
the Infertility Defense Fund

22:10.621 --> 22:13.374
say I'm not taking
their pain seriously.

22:13.374 --> 22:17.086
And the Alliance
for the Strategically Barren

22:17.086 --> 22:20.006
says that I'm shaming them
for not wanting children.

22:20.006 --> 22:23.676
And then I get this letter
from the SPCA...

22:23.676 --> 22:25.595
[crying]
...that says I'm not allowed

22:25.595 --> 22:29.515
to adopt a dog
for the next five years.

22:29.515 --> 22:30.808
You could still get a cat?

22:30.808 --> 22:33.811
No one wants a cat, Camille!

22:33.811 --> 22:38.649
These mass-rally things,
they go sideways so fast.

22:40.068 --> 22:41.652
I'm sorry.

22:41.652 --> 22:43.071
Shit.

22:43.071 --> 22:46.282
They're putting in
my replacement next week.

22:46.282 --> 22:47.658
About the promotion...

22:47.658 --> 22:49.077
Wait.

22:49.077 --> 22:52.330
So what does this mean
for my future?

22:52.330 --> 22:53.748
I don't know, Camille.

22:53.748 --> 22:55.958
But whatever it is,
I promise you,

22:55.958 --> 22:59.128
it's looking a whole shitload
better than mine.

22:59.128 --> 23:01.672
Hey, hey.
Más... más tequila.

23:01.672 --> 23:05.093
[bartender]
Two more coming up.

23:05.093 --> 23:07.095
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

23:08.429 --> 23:11.432
"My Heart Will Go On" playing]

23:20.691 --> 23:23.820
[clears throat]

23:23.820 --> 23:26.823
[indistinct chatter]

23:41.254 --> 23:42.713
[Brittany]
Camille!

23:42.713 --> 23:44.507
- Hi!
- Hey!

23:44.507 --> 23:45.883
[both laughing]

23:45.883 --> 23:47.135
How romantic is this?

23:47.135 --> 23:49.929
Paul and I watch Titanic
at least once a week.

23:49.929 --> 23:51.222
Yes.

23:51.222 --> 23:53.266
But doesn't he die
in the end?

23:53.266 --> 23:55.726
Please don't bring any
negative energy into my party.

23:55.726 --> 23:57.520
No, of course not.

23:57.520 --> 23:58.771
Okay.

23:58.771 --> 24:00.523
But to that end,
I got this really weird,

24:00.523 --> 24:01.732
uh, bad work news,

24:01.732 --> 24:03.943
and so I wanted
to say congratulations,

24:03.943 --> 24:05.945
and I wanted
to drop this off to you.

24:05.945 --> 24:08.156
Oh, so you came
to my engagement party

24:08.156 --> 24:10.324
to tell me you don't want
to come to my engagement party.

24:10.324 --> 24:13.744
No! No, no!
I... I want to be here.

24:13.744 --> 24:15.079
- It's just...
- Oh, good!

24:15.079 --> 24:16.747
I was just telling
our spiritual advisor

24:16.747 --> 24:19.167
there are two people I want to
see tonight, you and...

24:19.167 --> 24:20.001
Oh...

24:20.001 --> 24:21.002
Ian! Aah!

24:21.002 --> 24:22.920
- Aah!
- Ah, Ian!

24:32.763 --> 24:35.892
[squealing]

24:37.560 --> 24:38.769
Fuck.

24:41.898 --> 24:43.774
I'm proud of you.

24:46.652 --> 24:47.653
Camille.

24:47.653 --> 24:50.656
[sultry music]

24:51.991 --> 24:53.618
Camille.

24:55.620 --> 24:57.830
Ian!

24:57.830 --> 24:59.457
Hi.

24:59.457 --> 25:01.792
Um, ah...
[chuckles awkwardly]

25:01.792 --> 25:04.378
- Oh, that's awkward.
- [both laugh]

25:04.378 --> 25:05.588
Uh, sorry.

25:05.588 --> 25:07.506
I wasn't sure of the proper,
you know, etiquette.

25:07.506 --> 25:10.801
- Right, right, or ex-tiquette.
- [both laugh]

25:10.801 --> 25:12.303
You know, because
we're exes, so...

25:12.303 --> 25:13.596
That's what we are.

25:13.596 --> 25:15.431
Yeah. It was stupid.

25:15.431 --> 25:17.642
Um, so, hi.

25:17.642 --> 25:19.769
Uh, how...
how long you visiting for?

25:19.769 --> 25:22.772
Oh, no, I'm back now,
for good.

25:22.772 --> 25:25.149
Oh, wow.

25:25.149 --> 25:27.151
Ah, no luck finding the loo.

25:27.151 --> 25:28.819
Oh, okay.

25:28.819 --> 25:30.821
Um, Camille,
this is Mira.

25:30.821 --> 25:33.199
- Mira, Camille.
- You're gorgeous.

25:33.199 --> 25:35.743
Okay, I have needed to pee
the entire Uber here.

25:35.743 --> 25:37.453
Have you seen a bathroom?

25:39.205 --> 25:41.457
Ah, um, thank you.
[chuckles awkwardly]

25:41.457 --> 25:43.834
I mean, no,
I haven't seen the bathroom.

25:43.834 --> 25:45.461
I, um, um...
[snaps fingers]

25:45.461 --> 25:48.005
I was just saying thank you
for saying that I'm gorgeous.

25:48.005 --> 25:48.881
You're stunning.

25:48.881 --> 25:50.591
[giggles]
You're sweet.

25:50.591 --> 25:52.218
Ian?

25:52.218 --> 25:53.928
Uh, yeah, let's...
let's go find you a bathroom.

25:53.928 --> 25:55.346
Uh, we'll catch up in a bit?

25:55.346 --> 25:58.849
Yeah. Yeah.
Just try to stop me.

25:58.849 --> 26:02.645
[laughs]
Till we catch up later.

26:02.645 --> 26:05.147
I'm just...
Okay, stop talking, Camille.

26:05.147 --> 26:08.067
[cell phone vibrating]

26:08.067 --> 26:11.988
Girl, I was literally
just about to call you.

26:11.988 --> 26:14.448
- Ian brought a date.
- [Tye] Oh, no.

26:14.448 --> 26:17.243
On a scale from zero
to Rihanna, how bad we talking?

26:17.243 --> 26:18.744
She's fucking British, Tye.

26:18.744 --> 26:20.621
Oh, he got him
a Kate Middleton.

26:20.621 --> 26:22.290
[Camille] He's not just here
for the party.

26:22.290 --> 26:23.499
He's here for good.

26:23.499 --> 26:25.167
But it's not good.
I ran away again.

26:25.167 --> 26:28.087
I'm... I'm hiding
in the kitchen.

26:28.087 --> 26:29.463
I'm that basic bitch.

26:29.463 --> 26:30.798
Do you need me
to come save you?

26:30.798 --> 26:31.841
No, no, no.

26:31.841 --> 26:33.175
I just need to make my getaway.

26:33.175 --> 26:35.720
Oh, God, he's been standing
by the exit forever.

26:35.720 --> 26:38.347
As soon as he moves,
I am literally running.

26:38.347 --> 26:39.682
And you know what else?

26:39.682 --> 26:41.892
I think I might lose
my promotion, too.

26:41.892 --> 26:43.269
Like, what is going on?

26:43.269 --> 26:45.313
This has to be
that Saturn thing on my hand.

26:45.313 --> 26:46.814
Oh, no.
This is bad.

26:46.814 --> 26:50.318
You're giving credence
to my cousin's palm reading?

26:50.318 --> 26:51.861
But something
definitely is up.

26:51.861 --> 26:54.196
You know that piece
I left the club with?

26:54.196 --> 26:58.117
She ate me out, ate my food,
and then she dipped!

26:58.117 --> 27:00.119
No note, no text, no nothing.

27:00.119 --> 27:02.288
Who the fuck does
she think she is, me?

27:02.288 --> 27:03.331
There you are!

27:03.331 --> 27:06.208
- Hey!
- Ah, game time!

27:06.208 --> 27:08.127
Please join us
for a super-fun round

27:08.127 --> 27:09.920
of Who Knows Brittany Best?

27:09.920 --> 27:11.130
I do!
[laughs]

27:11.130 --> 27:12.131
You do!

27:12.131 --> 27:13.507
- [laughs]
- Yeah.

27:13.507 --> 27:15.676
Okay, okay.

27:15.676 --> 27:17.053
[cook]
Cheese puffs are ready!

27:17.053 --> 27:18.471
[sighs]
I have to get out of here.

27:18.471 --> 27:19.889
[Tye]
Just breathe.

27:19.889 --> 27:22.808
Don't get all Camille
about this.

27:22.808 --> 27:25.353
[exhales sharply]
Right.

27:25.353 --> 27:26.645
What?

27:26.645 --> 27:28.147
[bridesmaid]
Let's try this again.

27:28.147 --> 27:29.523
This'll be the one.

27:29.523 --> 27:33.694
What is Brittany's favorite
Bette Midler movie?

27:33.694 --> 27:36.530
No, Paul!
Fuck you!

27:36.530 --> 27:37.782
How do you not remember

27:37.782 --> 27:39.367
my favorite Bette Midler movie
is Beaches?

27:39.367 --> 27:40.576
You told me
it was Hocus...

27:41.577 --> 27:43.746
Phew.

27:43.746 --> 27:46.582
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

27:46.582 --> 27:49.585
[distant siren wailing]

27:52.880 --> 27:54.298
Where you going?

27:55.633 --> 27:57.176
Oh.

27:57.176 --> 27:58.469
Hi.

27:58.469 --> 28:02.848
Um, I, um, have this thing
that I have to do, so...

28:02.848 --> 28:04.975
[chuckles]
No, you don't.

28:04.975 --> 28:09.313
No, I don't,
but this party sucks.

28:09.313 --> 28:10.773
It's Paul and Brittany.
What do you expect?

28:10.773 --> 28:11.982
[both chuckle]

28:11.982 --> 28:13.776
Of course you're out here
getting high.

28:13.776 --> 28:15.903
Oh, relax.
It's legal now.

28:15.903 --> 28:17.446
No, it's not.

28:17.446 --> 28:18.948
You sound like my mother.

28:21.158 --> 28:22.368
How is Regina?

28:22.368 --> 28:23.994
Still always asking
about you.

28:23.994 --> 28:25.579
Here.

28:26.705 --> 28:28.791
You ain't gonna get arrested.

28:32.002 --> 28:32.878
[whistles]

28:38.968 --> 28:41.512
Hold on, hold on.
Easy there, tiger.

28:41.512 --> 28:44.473
- [coughing]
- [chuckles]

28:44.473 --> 28:47.810
Yeah, I feel like the last time
I was really high was with you.

28:47.810 --> 28:49.812
- No.
- Yeah.

28:49.812 --> 28:51.230
Yeah?

28:51.230 --> 28:52.731
Uh, Britt
and Paul's game night.

28:52.731 --> 28:53.732
Mm.

28:53.732 --> 28:55.734
Remember that?
Oh, my gosh!

28:55.734 --> 28:58.654
Can you imagine how absurd
their wedding's gonna be?

28:58.654 --> 29:00.865
Like, I think I heard
something about stilt walkers.

29:00.865 --> 29:02.241
Oh, Jesus.

29:02.241 --> 29:03.909
Yeah, I'm definitely gonna
have to fake an illness

29:03.909 --> 29:05.161
to get out of that.

29:05.161 --> 29:08.164
- I almost did that tonight.
- Yeah, me too.

29:09.373 --> 29:11.584
You know
I saw you the other night?

29:11.584 --> 29:14.462
At a open mic.
I just didn't say anything.

29:14.462 --> 29:15.838
Really?

29:15.838 --> 29:19.049
[scoffs]
That's weird.

29:19.049 --> 29:20.759
Why didn't you say anything?

29:20.759 --> 29:23.053
I just, uh...

29:23.053 --> 29:25.431
I don't know.

29:25.431 --> 29:28.058
Seeing you was...

29:28.058 --> 29:29.977
I don't know. I just kind of
got overwhelmed, you know?

29:29.977 --> 29:32.062
- Yeah.
- I got so much to say,

29:32.062 --> 29:34.064
I don't even know
where to start.

29:36.233 --> 29:38.360
I mean, I was hoping
you'd be here tonight, though.

29:40.112 --> 29:41.405
You look good.

29:41.405 --> 29:44.366
Thanks.
So do you.

29:44.366 --> 29:46.243
Like I remember.

29:48.370 --> 29:50.498
Except for you cut your hair.

29:50.498 --> 29:52.500
- Mm. You like it?
- [chuckles]

29:52.500 --> 29:54.877
"I Want You Around"]

29:54.877 --> 29:57.838
Yeah.
It, um, it suits you.

29:57.838 --> 29:59.089
Thanks.

30:01.759 --> 30:05.471
Um, I should probably go,
because I have,

30:05.471 --> 30:08.849
uh, this work and stuff
I have to get to, so...

30:08.849 --> 30:11.185
- Yeah, I'm gonna, um, go.
- Stay...

30:11.185 --> 30:12.853
if you want.

30:27.535 --> 30:28.744
[door opens]

30:28.744 --> 30:31.038
You done smoking?
Ah.

30:31.038 --> 30:33.666
The party games are over.

30:33.666 --> 30:35.334
Ended in a lot of tears.

30:35.334 --> 30:37.545
It was hilarious.
[laughs]

30:37.545 --> 30:39.505
This one despises games.

30:39.505 --> 30:41.215
[both chuckle]

30:41.215 --> 30:43.968
Oh, is that right?

30:43.968 --> 30:45.719
[giggles]

30:47.054 --> 30:50.140
Um, so I'll...
I will see you guys later.

30:50.140 --> 30:52.351
- Okay, nice to meet you.
- [both] Yeah.

30:52.351 --> 30:53.686
- Bye.
- Bye.

30:53.686 --> 30:55.312
[Mira]
Oh, my gosh.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.565
I am so ready to dance.

30:57.565 --> 30:59.942
- [Ian] Yeah?
- [Mira giggles]

30:59.942 --> 31:02.820
[conversation
continues indistinctly]

31:05.072 --> 31:06.365
[door closes]

31:42.192 --> 31:43.819
[doorbell buzzes]

31:50.826 --> 31:52.411
[doorbell buzzes]

32:00.586 --> 32:02.212
Hey.

32:02.212 --> 32:03.255
Hey.

32:05.924 --> 32:08.719
I was gonna give you a call,
but you changed your number.

32:08.719 --> 32:11.722
Yeah. I was, uh, I was getting
all these calls from China.

32:11.722 --> 32:13.515
Well, actually, they could
have been from anywhere,

32:13.515 --> 32:15.267
but the person who was calling
was speaking Chinese,

32:15.267 --> 32:17.019
which I don't know, so
I didn't know what she wanted.

32:17.019 --> 32:18.896
Yeah, I was getting them
so much that I even thought

32:18.896 --> 32:20.648
about learning Chinese,
just so I could tell this woman

32:20.648 --> 32:21.857
I'm not who she's looking for,

32:21.857 --> 32:23.442
but that seemed
like a lot of effort.

32:23.442 --> 32:25.402
Am I still talking about this?

32:25.402 --> 32:27.154
I got to get something
off my chest.

32:27.154 --> 32:28.447
Wait.

32:28.447 --> 32:29.490
Me first.

32:31.825 --> 32:34.662
I also saw you at open mic.

32:34.662 --> 32:38.082
And I was afraid to say hi...

32:38.082 --> 32:39.875
because I might not
just say hi.

32:39.875 --> 32:42.503
I might kiss you,

32:42.503 --> 32:44.672
like I did

32:44.672 --> 32:47.883
and say I made a mistake.

32:47.883 --> 32:49.385
I know it.
My friends know it.

32:49.385 --> 32:51.261
None of us say it, but...

32:52.680 --> 32:55.265
...it was a mistake.

32:55.265 --> 32:57.226
I should have at least tried.

32:57.226 --> 32:59.353
I shouldn't have let
the distance keep us

32:59.353 --> 33:00.562
from being together.

33:00.562 --> 33:03.899
[chuckles]
And now that you're back...

33:05.693 --> 33:08.445
...I think we should give us
another shot.

33:08.445 --> 33:11.448
[dramatic music]

33:14.702 --> 33:16.912
[chuckles]
Okay.

33:16.912 --> 33:18.497
I just poured out
my heart to you.

33:18.497 --> 33:19.915
It's your turn.
It's called reciprocity.

33:19.915 --> 33:21.083
Say something.

33:21.083 --> 33:23.961
[chuckles] Um, Camille...

33:23.961 --> 33:25.295
Yes.

33:25.295 --> 33:26.755
...uh,

33:26.755 --> 33:28.507
...I'm engaged.
