WEBVTT

00:04.482 --> 00:06.223
- Previously
on "New Amsterdam"...

00:06.267 --> 00:08.095
Luna, say hi to your mom.

00:13.535 --> 00:15.537
- Still no pulse.
- 18-gauge cardiac needle.

00:15.580 --> 00:17.321
20cc syringe.
Now.

00:22.413 --> 00:23.719
Told you I got you.

00:23.762 --> 00:25.677
- You could make me
co-chair of your department,

00:25.721 --> 00:27.331
or you can find
someone else to administer

00:27.375 --> 00:29.203
precision target therapy...

00:29.246 --> 00:30.726
Max's precision target therapy.

00:30.769 --> 00:33.555
- Dr. Nottingham dropped me
from the cardiac rotation.

00:33.598 --> 00:35.687
- Dr. Nottingham dropped you
at my suggestion.

00:35.731 --> 00:36.775
- You made a mistake.

00:36.819 --> 00:38.516
I'm the best intern up in here.

00:38.560 --> 00:41.171
So good, these hands will be
coming for your job one day.

00:46.220 --> 00:47.743
- Where--where--
where's Georgia?

00:58.232 --> 00:59.711
- Excuse me.

01:33.919 --> 01:35.660
Big day today.

01:35.704 --> 01:37.314
Hey, I'm gonna need
every department

01:37.358 --> 01:40.752
in the auditorium
around noon sharp.

01:40.796 --> 01:43.146
- Some of us have--
what are those called, jobs?

01:43.190 --> 01:44.626
- Yeah, but this
is all about your job.

01:44.669 --> 01:46.236
- So this about
my thoracoabdominal repair

01:46.280 --> 01:47.411
in OR Six?

01:47.455 --> 01:48.630
- TouchÃ©,
but this won't take long.

01:48.673 --> 01:49.848
I promise you.

01:49.892 --> 01:51.633
Don't look so worried.

01:51.676 --> 01:52.764
- Look, last time you asked me
to the auditorium,

01:52.808 --> 01:54.244
you accused me of malpractice.

01:54.288 --> 01:56.681
- That was a bad day.
This is a big day.

01:56.725 --> 01:58.205
Huge difference.

02:00.163 --> 02:01.121
Sandra Fall from billing.

02:01.164 --> 02:02.383
- Max Goodwin from medicine.

02:02.426 --> 02:04.385
- I see what you did there.
Big day today.

02:04.428 --> 02:06.474
- You want every department in
the auditorium at noon sharp.

02:06.517 --> 02:07.605
- Wow. Good news travels fast.

02:07.649 --> 02:08.824
- That's one way
to look at it.

02:08.867 --> 02:10.391
- I also have one teeny,
tiny favor.

02:10.434 --> 02:11.566
How good are you
with PowerPoint?

02:11.609 --> 02:12.828
- Don't you have
an assistant?

02:12.871 --> 02:15.178
- Oh, Dora crossed
enemy lines into HCC.

02:15.222 --> 02:17.267
Said she couldn't turn down
a job with, you know,

02:17.311 --> 02:18.442
regular hours and a desk.

02:18.486 --> 02:20.227
- Wow. Couldn't imagine.

02:20.270 --> 02:22.229
- So about that favor.

02:24.448 --> 02:25.928
- So, elephant in the room,
the last time Max

02:25.971 --> 02:27.234
called everybody together,

02:27.277 --> 02:29.627
he fired the entire
cardio department.

02:29.671 --> 02:31.368
Who's it gonna be today?

02:31.412 --> 02:33.762
- Now that Helen is back,
I think Max is announcing

02:33.805 --> 02:35.851
that he's taking time off.

02:35.894 --> 02:37.592
- Well, that's not
very exciting.

02:37.635 --> 02:38.723
Carrot?

02:38.767 --> 02:40.508
- No.
- Okay.

02:41.465 --> 02:43.424
- Max hasn't taken time off

02:43.467 --> 02:44.816
to mourn Georgia's death.

02:44.860 --> 02:47.297
- Yeah, well,
he's compartmentalizing.

02:47.341 --> 02:48.907
You know, one of the healthiest
ways to navigate loss

02:48.951 --> 02:51.519
is to just
give yourself some time.

02:51.562 --> 02:53.912
- He needs to grieve.

02:53.956 --> 02:56.567
- Vijay, you can't
make Max grieve.

02:56.611 --> 02:58.482
- You're not tired
of Max acting

02:58.526 --> 03:00.310
like nothing has happened?

03:00.354 --> 03:01.833
- Yeah, all right,
so hey, everybody,

03:01.877 --> 03:04.706
go ahead and sit or stand
or whatever feels good.

03:04.749 --> 03:06.969
Dr. Sharpe in the house.
Thank you for coming.

03:08.275 --> 03:09.493
So...

03:09.537 --> 03:11.495
We are all here
to discuss

03:11.539 --> 03:15.369
the single most important
study of the last decade.

03:15.412 --> 03:17.588
And I love your enthusiasm,

03:17.632 --> 03:20.852
but pretty sure I am about
to answer your question.

03:20.896 --> 03:23.420
With--yep--no,
with the next slide,

03:23.464 --> 03:24.726
which would be...

03:24.769 --> 03:26.293
uh, sorry, just--

03:26.336 --> 03:27.555
There we go. Yes.

03:27.598 --> 03:31.298
This study impacts housing,
education,

03:31.341 --> 03:34.344
representation,
and especially health care.

03:34.388 --> 03:37.347
I think you all know
what I'm talking about.

03:37.391 --> 03:40.307
I'm talking about
the U.S. Census.

03:51.535 --> 03:53.015
Really? Nothing?
Nothing for the Census--

03:53.058 --> 03:54.625
- Whoo!
- One guy.

03:54.669 --> 03:55.757
- Yeah.
- Thank you, Dr. Frome.

03:55.800 --> 03:57.280
Appreciate it.

03:57.324 --> 03:58.368
So how about this?

03:58.412 --> 04:00.718
What if I told you
that your zip code

04:00.762 --> 04:02.590
plays a factor
in how long you live?

04:02.633 --> 04:05.288
It's crazy, right?
No? Yeah?

04:05.332 --> 04:08.335
It's--okay--this next visual
is gonna answer your question.

04:08.378 --> 04:10.380
Hit it.
Boom.

04:10.424 --> 04:11.903
In Washington, D.C.,

04:11.947 --> 04:14.819
people living
in the Barry Farms neighborhood

04:14.863 --> 04:17.605
have a life expectancy
of 63.2 years.

04:17.648 --> 04:19.520
But just ten miles away,

04:19.563 --> 04:21.609
ten miles, there we go,
right there,

04:21.652 --> 04:24.264
people living
in Friendship Heights

04:24.307 --> 04:27.397
might live as long
as 96 years, right?

04:27.441 --> 04:29.486
Does that--no?
Does that not blow your mind?

04:29.530 --> 04:32.315
Just ten miles represents

04:32.359 --> 04:37.451
a life expectancy difference
of almost 33 years.

04:40.323 --> 04:41.759
Yeah.

04:41.803 --> 04:43.457
- What does this have to do
with New Amsterdam?

04:43.500 --> 04:44.719
- That's a very good question,

04:44.762 --> 04:46.634
and I was just about
to get to that.

04:46.677 --> 04:52.422
These zip codes are just
a shorthand for communities,

04:52.466 --> 04:54.859
and with over 5,000 employees,

04:54.903 --> 04:58.863
New Amsterdam
is also a community.

04:58.907 --> 05:01.344
Yes, well done.

05:01.388 --> 05:02.345
But here's the problem.

05:02.389 --> 05:04.782
I don't know the first thing

05:04.826 --> 05:09.047
about so many of you,
and I should.

05:09.091 --> 05:11.049
I want to.
I want to know everything,

05:11.093 --> 05:13.356
because I'm willing to bet
that if I can improve

05:13.400 --> 05:15.750
your quality of life,
then our patients

05:15.793 --> 05:18.535
will get better care.

05:18.579 --> 05:20.450
Because how can you
take care of others

05:20.494 --> 05:22.496
if you're not
taking care of yourself?

05:26.543 --> 05:27.979
- Are we all getting raises?

05:28.023 --> 05:30.547
- Yeah, I wish, but no.

05:30.591 --> 05:32.027
- Are we getting
paid vacation time?

05:32.070 --> 05:34.769
- No.
We're broke.

05:34.812 --> 05:35.987
But I do have
a little something for you.

05:36.031 --> 05:37.598
If you look under your seat,

05:37.641 --> 05:40.601
you will find--
drumroll, please...

05:40.644 --> 05:42.646
That's you, Sandra.

05:42.690 --> 05:43.647
Yeah, do it.
You got it.

05:43.691 --> 05:45.736
Yes, that's a drumroll.

05:45.780 --> 05:48.652
Yes, the New Amsterdam census.

05:49.958 --> 05:51.960
Yeah, okay.
- Whoo!

05:52.003 --> 05:53.657
- Thank you again, Dr. Frome.

05:53.701 --> 05:55.659
One guy.

05:55.703 --> 05:57.661
So go ahead
and fill this form out,

05:57.705 --> 05:59.010
and then you
can go back to work,

05:59.054 --> 06:01.622
and I will get to work
learning more about you

06:01.665 --> 06:03.363
because I just want to know...

06:03.406 --> 06:05.408
all: How can I help?

06:11.893 --> 06:13.547
Oh, God.

06:13.590 --> 06:15.070
Why does this hurt so much?

06:15.113 --> 06:17.638
- Probably because
you're doing it wrong.

06:17.681 --> 06:20.510
You're forgetting
to extend from the knee.

06:20.554 --> 06:21.685
- You know what?
I know a great place

06:21.729 --> 06:23.470
I could extend my knee into.

06:23.513 --> 06:24.471
- I'd actually
love to see that,

06:24.514 --> 06:25.689
because at this rate,

06:25.733 --> 06:26.821
you'll be walking
without a cane

06:26.864 --> 06:28.866
in approximately...

06:28.910 --> 06:32.000
200 million years.

06:32.043 --> 06:33.871
- Dr. Ligon...

06:33.915 --> 06:35.743
you should know
that I have always

06:35.786 --> 06:37.527
found you to be insufferable.

06:37.571 --> 06:38.615
- Mm.

06:38.659 --> 06:40.748
- Christmas parties,
staff meetings,

06:40.791 --> 06:43.446
and now I can confidently say

06:43.490 --> 06:45.883
that same quality transfers

06:45.927 --> 06:48.843
seamlessly to your PT sessions.

06:48.886 --> 06:50.975
- And I've seen
80-year-old stroke victims

06:51.019 --> 06:53.195
improve their range of motion
faster than you.

06:53.238 --> 06:54.936
- You know what?
You try recovering

06:54.979 --> 06:58.722
from a fractured tibia
with zero pain meds.

06:58.766 --> 07:00.594
- Yeah,
I wish I could offer you

07:00.637 --> 07:02.683
something besides
modern medicine,

07:02.726 --> 07:07.427
but I'm, you know,
just a doctor.

07:08.993 --> 07:10.865
Actually...

07:10.908 --> 07:12.214
hold on.

07:13.781 --> 07:14.738
- What?

07:14.782 --> 07:16.740
- I do have one thing

07:16.784 --> 07:19.134
that might help you take
your mind off the pain.

07:19.177 --> 07:20.222
- Seriously?

07:21.571 --> 07:22.659
- Huh?

07:22.703 --> 07:24.052
Meep-meep.

07:24.095 --> 07:25.619
But I want it back.

07:26.924 --> 07:28.622
So don't go
getting addicted to it.

07:32.539 --> 07:34.454
- As the new co-chair
of oncology,

07:34.497 --> 07:36.499
I'm happy to announce
that every oncology patient

07:36.543 --> 07:38.240
at New Amsterdam
will be eligible

07:38.283 --> 07:39.763
for precision targeted therapy.

07:39.807 --> 07:41.852
- If the DNA sequence
of your tumor is a match

07:41.896 --> 07:43.637
for the available treatment.

07:43.680 --> 07:45.987
- And all I have to do
is sign this release?

07:46.030 --> 07:47.902
- And we'll sequence the biopsy
we already have on record.

07:47.945 --> 07:50.948
- Which will help us determine
where the defective DNA is.

07:50.992 --> 07:52.907
- So you're saying
my stomach cancer

07:52.950 --> 07:54.648
may not really be
stomach cancer?

07:54.691 --> 07:57.085
- Well, stomach cancer just
tells us where the cancer is,

07:57.128 --> 07:59.130
not necessarily
the kind of cancer.

07:59.174 --> 08:01.872
- Like a license plate tells
you what state you live in

08:01.916 --> 08:04.832
but the numbers are
specific to every car.

08:05.789 --> 08:07.530
- You lost me,
like, ten minutes ago.

08:08.792 --> 08:10.533
Targeted therapy
is exactly like it sounds.

08:10.577 --> 08:11.839
- It works
by targeting the cancer's

08:11.882 --> 08:13.231
genes, proteins, and enzymes,

08:13.275 --> 08:15.625
leaving the healthy
cells alone.

08:15.669 --> 08:19.716
- So all the side effects
from radiation and chemo...

08:19.760 --> 08:22.719
- Gone.
- Diminished considerably.

08:22.763 --> 08:24.242
- So what's the downside?

08:24.286 --> 08:25.766
- Well--
- There isn't a downside

08:25.809 --> 08:26.767
to being tested,

08:26.810 --> 08:28.899
and if you fall in the 5%

08:28.943 --> 08:30.074
who qualify for treatment--

08:30.118 --> 08:31.859
- 5%?

08:31.902 --> 08:33.164
- 5%?

08:33.208 --> 08:34.557
- 5%?

08:34.601 --> 08:37.734
- But it means significantly
less chemotherapy.

08:37.778 --> 08:40.084
Imagine coming in for two pills
instead of two hours.

08:40.128 --> 08:42.217
- I'd miss
my Dr. Sharpe time, though.

08:43.610 --> 08:45.829
- It also means
no more radiation.

08:45.873 --> 08:48.615
- It means full remission.

08:51.226 --> 08:53.184
- Well, sign me up.

08:53.228 --> 08:54.969
- You had me at less chemo.

09:01.889 --> 09:03.064
- See?

09:03.107 --> 09:04.282
We make a great team.

09:11.638 --> 09:13.335
- Manny Talis,
44-year-old school bus driver

09:13.378 --> 09:14.771
with right-sided chest pain.

09:14.815 --> 09:17.121
Heart rate 94.
BP 135 over 80

09:17.165 --> 09:19.254
with resps of 14.
Normal EKG.

09:19.297 --> 09:20.821
But when we went
to put on the EKG leads,

09:20.864 --> 09:21.952
we found this rash.

09:21.996 --> 09:23.693
- Ooh, okay,
get him to curtains.

09:23.737 --> 09:25.347
Okay, Mr. Talis,
good news.

09:25.390 --> 09:27.044
I don't think
you're having a heart attack.

09:27.088 --> 09:30.308
I think the pain is caused
by the rash on your chest.

09:30.352 --> 09:32.310
It's called shingles,
and it is a reactivation

09:32.354 --> 09:35.183
of the virus
that causes chicken pox.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.924
- Is there anything
you can do for the pain?

09:36.967 --> 09:38.665
- Mm, ibuprofen.

09:38.708 --> 09:39.796
- That's it?

09:39.840 --> 09:44.061
- Oh, well,
you could try this.

09:44.105 --> 09:45.715
Maybe you'll find it
more useful than I did.

09:45.759 --> 09:47.674
- I'll tell you what.
I'll trade you.

09:47.717 --> 09:50.241
One of the kids
left this on the bus.

09:50.285 --> 09:51.678
- Ooh.

09:51.721 --> 09:53.984
You're on.
Okay.

09:54.028 --> 09:55.899
Well, I am gonna get
cardiology to sign off,

09:55.943 --> 09:58.728
and if they do, then you can
recuperate at home.

09:58.772 --> 10:01.383
- All right, thank you, Doctor.

10:01.426 --> 10:03.167
- You're calling
the appropriate department

10:03.211 --> 10:05.605
instead of doing it
all yourself?

10:05.648 --> 10:06.954
Who is this Dr. Protocol,

10:06.997 --> 10:08.390
and what have you done
to Dr. Bloom?

10:08.433 --> 10:10.000
- Look at me evolving.

10:10.044 --> 10:12.002
Just page Reynolds
when he's out of surgery, okay?

10:12.046 --> 10:13.221
- All right.

10:13.264 --> 10:15.266
- I use a clamshell incision.

10:15.310 --> 10:17.965
This incision reveals
the pulmonary anatomy

10:18.008 --> 10:21.229
in a spectacular fashion.
You see that?

10:21.272 --> 10:25.233
Now, Duke, why don't you come
on over and take a better look?

10:27.670 --> 10:28.671
Come on.

10:33.720 --> 10:35.722
See that tissue right there?
- Mm-hmm.

10:35.765 --> 10:37.288
- Go ahead and throw in
a couple of stitches.

10:37.332 --> 10:38.681
Let's see what you got.

10:42.816 --> 10:44.165
No harm in admitting
you're not ready.

10:44.208 --> 10:45.296
- No, I'm ready.

10:45.340 --> 10:47.168
- All right, well...

10:47.211 --> 10:49.649
I hope you sew more confidently
than you sound.

10:57.395 --> 10:59.006
- Dr. Reynolds.

10:59.049 --> 11:00.050
- Duke, you got
about four seconds

11:00.094 --> 11:01.704
till my patient goes south.

11:16.110 --> 11:17.894
Mm.

11:19.200 --> 11:21.419
- Lower chance of dehiscence.

11:25.380 --> 11:27.208
- Damn, Duke.

11:28.862 --> 11:29.863
It's like a sewing machine.

11:32.169 --> 11:36.347
I want everyone to observe
Duke's forward sutures.

11:36.391 --> 11:37.348
See that?

11:41.788 --> 11:43.050
That's excellent.

11:45.530 --> 11:48.185
- They might not get it now,
but as soon as people see

11:48.229 --> 11:50.274
that this can improve
their quality of life

11:50.318 --> 11:51.798
here at New Amsterdam,
then I think

11:51.841 --> 11:52.886
they're really gonna
warm to it.

11:52.929 --> 11:53.974
- Well, this person
just drew a hand

11:54.017 --> 11:55.192
flipping you the bird.

11:55.236 --> 11:57.064
- There he is.
I gotta say, boss, nice work.

11:57.107 --> 11:59.240
A New Amsterdam census,
that is just brilliant.

11:59.283 --> 12:01.155
- Thank you.
Finally someone who gets it.

12:01.198 --> 12:02.852
- Except there is one community
in this hospital

12:02.896 --> 12:03.984
that can't fill out
your census.

12:04.027 --> 12:05.507
- Why's that?

12:05.550 --> 12:07.030
- Well, because they're not
allowed to use pens or pencils

12:07.074 --> 12:08.336
in an unsupervised setting.

12:08.379 --> 12:10.207
- You mean inmates?
- Yes, exactly. Celery?

12:10.251 --> 12:11.513
- But they're patients.

12:11.556 --> 12:12.427
So what does that have to do
with the census?

12:12.470 --> 12:13.733
- Well, if these patients

12:13.776 --> 12:14.951
could fill out your census
with something

12:14.995 --> 12:16.257
that wasn't considered
to be a weapon,

12:16.300 --> 12:17.345
I bet they would say
they're lacking

12:17.388 --> 12:18.868
in educational opportunities.

12:18.912 --> 12:20.174
- Really?
Is that what they would say?

12:20.217 --> 12:21.958
- Yes, they would,
because studies show that

12:22.002 --> 12:23.786
education vastly
reduces recidivism

12:23.830 --> 12:25.048
among inmate populations.

12:25.092 --> 12:26.223
We have classrooms.
We have inmates.

12:26.267 --> 12:27.355
Why are we not helping?

12:27.398 --> 12:28.965
- Very good idea.
Put it together.

12:29.009 --> 12:30.184
- Good, 'cause I already have.

12:31.925 --> 12:34.231
- We're not done with the
preadolescent process group.

12:34.275 --> 12:36.016
Where do I put the kids?

12:36.059 --> 12:38.366
- You can't have kids
in here with these guys.

12:38.409 --> 12:39.541
Are you nuts?
- Why are the kids

12:39.584 --> 12:40.934
running late?
- Iggy, what's the plan?

12:40.977 --> 12:42.892
- Kids, hi, kids.
Hi, guys, come on out.

12:42.936 --> 12:44.111
Everybody
down to the end of the hall.

12:44.154 --> 12:46.374
- I'm calling the warden.
- No, no, no need.

12:46.417 --> 12:47.592
- Yes.
- No.

12:47.636 --> 12:48.811
- Let's go.
- Just a stutter step, boss.

12:48.855 --> 12:50.465
Guys, my kids,
everyone scoot down.

12:50.508 --> 12:53.250
Nobody talk to the new adults.
Nobody look at the new adults.

12:53.294 --> 12:54.904
Just maybe help me
beat this door down, okay?

12:54.948 --> 12:56.253
Come here. Gladys!
- I'm here.

12:56.297 --> 12:57.820
- Hi. Do we have
the key for this door?

12:57.864 --> 12:59.561
- Uh, let me check.

12:59.604 --> 13:02.129
- Your census will literally
be the death of us.

13:04.479 --> 13:06.481
- Hello!
A little help, please.

13:12.530 --> 13:14.141
- Do you really still
need me here for this?

13:14.184 --> 13:15.490
- Come on.
This is exciting, right?

13:15.533 --> 13:16.839
- I never thought I'd say this,

13:16.883 --> 13:18.101
but please let me
go back to billing.

13:18.145 --> 13:21.539
- All right,
just hit me with another one.

13:21.583 --> 13:23.890
- Question 17:
32% of employees

13:23.933 --> 13:25.848
said they pull double shifts
more than twice a week.

13:25.892 --> 13:27.067
- Max.
- See? We can't have that.

13:27.110 --> 13:29.373
Let's put that
under overworked.

13:29.417 --> 13:31.811
No, you know what?
Mismanagement.

13:33.290 --> 13:35.336
Vijay, take a look at this.

13:35.379 --> 13:38.861
300 employees
say that they get less than

13:38.905 --> 13:41.255
two meals per week
with their families.

13:41.298 --> 13:42.952
That's unacceptable.

13:44.214 --> 13:45.259
- Max.

13:47.348 --> 13:49.829
I think you should
talk to someone.

13:52.135 --> 13:53.093
- That's a great idea.

13:55.573 --> 13:57.575
Research shows that eating
family meals together,

13:57.619 --> 13:59.795
like Luna and I
are doing right now,

13:59.839 --> 14:01.318
can result
in lower obesity rates

14:01.362 --> 14:02.929
and kids staying off
drugs and alcohol,

14:02.972 --> 14:04.974
not to mention lower
instances of depression.

14:05.018 --> 14:08.978
So you're all here because,
based on the census,

14:09.022 --> 14:11.807
you're eating virtually
no meals with your families.

14:11.851 --> 14:13.156
Tell me why.

14:15.985 --> 14:17.900
Anyone?

14:17.944 --> 14:19.902
Just shout it out.
Anybody?

14:20.511 --> 14:23.340
- Come on, who has time to cook
after a 12-hour day?

14:23.384 --> 14:25.473
- Long hours. Got it.
Keep them coming.

14:25.516 --> 14:27.388
- Hey, my family lives
all the way in Albuquerque.

14:27.431 --> 14:28.955
- Family too far.
Copy that.

14:28.998 --> 14:31.305
- By the time I get home,
my kids have finished eating.

14:31.348 --> 14:32.959
- Does fast food count?

14:33.002 --> 14:34.351
- Really, Miguel?

14:34.395 --> 14:35.875
- When you put patients first,

14:35.918 --> 14:38.529
you put yourself second...
or third.

14:40.183 --> 14:41.489
- So you gonna send us
home early?

14:42.664 --> 14:44.492
- Yeah, I can't do that.

14:44.535 --> 14:45.972
- Are you sending us
home with food?

14:46.015 --> 14:49.453
- Currently,
I have zero budget for this.

14:49.497 --> 14:51.151
- So what are you gonna do?

14:51.194 --> 14:54.458
- No idea whatsoever, but--
I know. I know.

14:54.502 --> 14:56.069
I'm working on it.

14:56.112 --> 14:58.332
So is Luna,
so yeah.

14:58.375 --> 14:59.463
We're gonna figure it out.

15:02.292 --> 15:04.381
- BMI is 24.
Dead in the middle.

15:04.425 --> 15:06.470
- All right, suction.

15:06.514 --> 15:07.950
Clamp.
- Dr. Reynolds,

15:07.994 --> 15:09.865
Dr. Bloom is still waiting
on that shingles eval.

15:11.040 --> 15:13.173
Think you can handle that,
Duke?

15:13.216 --> 15:14.957
- Yeah.
For sure.

15:15.001 --> 15:16.959
- What are the four things
to do when diagnosing

15:17.003 --> 15:19.005
for thoracic
varicella infection?

15:19.048 --> 15:21.355
- One, measure the rash
and outline it with a Sharpie.

15:21.398 --> 15:22.443
- Uh-huh.

15:22.486 --> 15:23.444
- Two, check for
respiratory function,

15:23.487 --> 15:24.662
making sure
the lungs are clear.

15:24.706 --> 15:26.055
- Suture.

15:26.099 --> 15:28.057
- Three, examine the mouth
for signs of oral lesions.

15:28.101 --> 15:29.537
And four,
check the ear for vesicle

15:29.580 --> 15:32.018
on the tympanic membrane.

15:32.061 --> 15:33.236
- Well, go do it.

15:34.585 --> 15:35.543
Clamp.

15:38.241 --> 15:39.982
Duke.
- Hmm?

15:40.026 --> 15:41.418
- Take off our gown.

15:51.211 --> 15:52.690
- What happened
to your fidget spinner?

15:52.734 --> 15:55.911
- It stopped spinning after
I threw it against a wall.

15:55.955 --> 15:57.608
- So now you have
a rubber band?

15:57.652 --> 16:00.220
- Every time I feel
the crushing pain in my leg,

16:00.263 --> 16:02.048
I snap the rubber band
to refocus

16:02.091 --> 16:03.527
on the lesser pain in my wrist.

16:03.571 --> 16:05.051
- Is it working?

16:05.094 --> 16:07.401
- Can't you tell
by my chipper attitude?

16:07.444 --> 16:10.012
- I've been meaning to ask.
If you're off everything,

16:10.056 --> 16:12.232
how are you managing your ADHD?

16:12.275 --> 16:14.495
- There, my friend, is the
silver lining in all of this.

16:14.538 --> 16:16.671
It turns out that pain
is a great focuser.

16:16.714 --> 16:18.673
Now I actually
want a distraction.

16:18.716 --> 16:20.588
- Dr. Bloom?

16:20.631 --> 16:23.243
Dr. Reynolds sent me
to check on a shingles patient.

16:23.286 --> 16:25.114
- Mr. Talis.
Right there.

16:25.158 --> 16:26.376
- Thank you.

16:26.420 --> 16:28.204
- He must really like you.

16:28.248 --> 16:29.640
Send you down here solo.

16:29.684 --> 16:32.252
- I can't tell if he likes me
or is punishing me.

16:32.295 --> 16:35.298
- Yeah.
Get used to it.

16:41.783 --> 16:45.047
- I think we got it
all surrounded.

16:45.091 --> 16:47.093
- Yeah, looks like it.

16:47.136 --> 16:48.398
- A few deep breaths.

16:48.442 --> 16:50.052
- Oh, yeah.

16:53.055 --> 16:55.144
- Sounds good.

16:56.145 --> 16:57.538
Now open wide.

16:59.714 --> 17:01.150
Mm-hmm.

17:03.631 --> 17:05.459
You can't keep me here!
I know my rights!

17:05.502 --> 17:07.287
- Ma'am, ma'am, ma'am.
- I'm calling my lawyer.

17:07.330 --> 17:08.897
- Could you at least
keep the robe on, please?

17:08.940 --> 17:11.073
- Don't tell me what to do.
- Just come over to your bed,

17:11.117 --> 17:12.466
and you can go ahead
and make that phone call, okay?

17:12.509 --> 17:15.469
- Hey, Doc, we done here?

17:16.513 --> 17:20.039
- Yeah, I think we're good.
I'll get you discharged.

17:20.082 --> 17:22.258
- You people don't know
anything about health care.

17:22.302 --> 17:23.390
- Heard it all before.

17:26.784 --> 17:29.744
- Dr. Frome.
- Warden Salazar, hello. Hi.

17:29.787 --> 17:33.487
I assure you that I purchased
all of these lawfully.

17:33.530 --> 17:35.663
- All of these what, exactly?
- The classics.

17:35.706 --> 17:37.665
The stuff that I'm gonna
be teaching in class today.

17:37.708 --> 17:41.016
- I approved this experiment
but not your syllabus.

17:41.060 --> 17:42.539
- I wasn't aware that
I had to submit a syllabus.

17:42.583 --> 17:44.193
- "Autobiography of Malcolm X"?

17:44.237 --> 17:45.803
- Yeah, it's a searing portrait
of race in America.

17:45.847 --> 17:47.240
- "Catch-22"?

17:47.283 --> 17:48.719
- Absurdist
anti-war commentary.

17:48.763 --> 17:50.025
- "The Catcher in the Rye."

17:50.069 --> 17:51.026
- This is censorship.

17:51.070 --> 17:52.723
You are taking away
their rights.

17:52.767 --> 17:54.725
- That's what happens
when you go to jail.

17:55.683 --> 17:58.642
- Oh, okay.

17:58.686 --> 18:00.340
Then what am I
supposed to teach?

18:00.383 --> 18:01.515
- Teach them whatever you want.

18:01.558 --> 18:03.125
Just don't give them any ideas.

18:03.169 --> 18:05.127
- Sounds reasonable.

18:05.171 --> 18:07.260
- Good luck.
Have fun.

18:08.870 --> 18:10.524
- Hey, you paged?

18:10.567 --> 18:13.135
- Yeah, I've got some new
budget recs for you to sign.

18:13.179 --> 18:14.397
- Good. I've been
waiting for these,

18:14.441 --> 18:15.529
seeing as how
you decided to split

18:15.572 --> 18:18.140
your department
with Dr. Castro.

18:18.184 --> 18:19.272
- She's great, isn't she?
- She is,

18:19.315 --> 18:20.447
which still doesn't explain

18:20.490 --> 18:23.102
why you gave her
half your department.

18:24.494 --> 18:26.844
- Uh-oh, my chemo brain's
got me hallucinating

18:26.888 --> 18:28.759
'cause I think I see...

18:28.803 --> 18:31.153
- Max.
You look amazing.

18:31.197 --> 18:33.808
- Did you get taller?
- Whoa, he totally got taller.

18:33.851 --> 18:36.724
- I don't know about that,
but you guys look great too.

18:36.767 --> 18:40.554
- How are you worse at lying
than you are at euchre?

18:40.597 --> 18:42.295
- But I'm gonna look great
after I get my new

18:42.338 --> 18:44.210
precision target treatment.

18:44.253 --> 18:45.733
- Yes, we're all getting tested

18:45.776 --> 18:47.169
to see if we're eligible.

18:47.213 --> 18:48.388
- Yeah, we want the good stuff.

18:48.431 --> 18:50.390
- I just want you
to remember the odds.

18:50.433 --> 18:52.261
Max is one of the lucky ones.

18:53.610 --> 18:55.786
With the treatment.

18:57.179 --> 18:58.267
- It's good seeing you guys.

18:58.311 --> 19:00.182
- Yeah, you too.

19:04.795 --> 19:09.235
- Max, Max, I think what you
are doing is really admirable.

19:09.278 --> 19:10.584
- Is there a but coming?
- No, no, no, no.

19:10.627 --> 19:12.194
You are asking
an essential question.

19:12.238 --> 19:13.630
How can we take care
of our patients

19:13.674 --> 19:15.415
if we are not taking care
of ourselves?

19:15.458 --> 19:16.720
- Yeah, exactly.
- But--

19:16.764 --> 19:17.895
- Ah, okay,
I see what you did there.

19:17.939 --> 19:19.288
You buried the but.

19:19.332 --> 19:20.855
- But there is one employee
you are ignoring

19:20.898 --> 19:23.858
who needs help even though
they are not asking for help.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.207
- Okay, thank you.

19:25.251 --> 19:26.861
- Who?

19:26.904 --> 19:28.210
- You.

19:35.261 --> 19:36.305
- Max.

19:40.744 --> 19:42.181
- Here you go.

19:42.224 --> 19:44.400
Latte for you
and one for you.

19:44.444 --> 19:46.881
I'll take that.
This one goes to you.

19:46.924 --> 19:48.622
- You're gonna pay
for this, right?

19:48.665 --> 19:49.840
- Yes, I am.

19:49.884 --> 19:51.712
See, the reason
that you're all here is,

19:51.755 --> 19:53.496
on the census,
you answered that you each get

19:53.540 --> 19:56.412
less than five hours
of sleep per night.

19:56.456 --> 19:58.501
- We need more sleep.
Can we go back to work?

19:58.545 --> 19:59.850
- Yeah, well, the thing is,
sleep deprivation

19:59.894 --> 20:01.287
is no joke, okay?

20:01.330 --> 20:03.506
It can lead
to high blood pressure,

20:03.550 --> 20:06.205
diabetes, weight gain,
weakened immune system,

20:06.248 --> 20:09.686
not to mention memory loss
and increased errors at work.

20:09.730 --> 20:12.385
- So you're caffeinating us?

20:12.428 --> 20:13.951
- Actually, stimulants
like that mochaccino

20:13.995 --> 20:16.345
can't begin to replace what you
lose from a lack of sleep.

20:16.389 --> 20:19.479
The mochaccinos were really
just a bribe to get you here

20:19.522 --> 20:21.742
so I could ask you why you
aren't getting enough sleep.

20:21.785 --> 20:24.701
So...why aren't you?

20:24.745 --> 20:26.660
- Well, I have
to get up super early

20:26.703 --> 20:28.357
to make it to my shift
on time.

20:28.401 --> 20:29.793
- Yeah, I want to sleep more,

20:29.837 --> 20:31.752
but I got real-life
responsibilities, you know?

20:31.795 --> 20:33.536
- I always think I can nap
during my commute

20:33.580 --> 20:35.321
but too many transfers.
- Too many transfers.

20:35.364 --> 20:36.670
- Right.
- Mm.

20:37.671 --> 20:41.457
- So, like, do you have
any support to fix this?

20:41.501 --> 20:44.504
- No, no support.
Just me.

20:44.547 --> 20:47.637
But don't worry,
because I am all over this.

20:48.812 --> 20:52.294
And if you any additional
questions or comments,

20:52.338 --> 20:54.340
please take them up
with Dr. Kapoor.

20:56.864 --> 20:59.040
- Blood pressure looks good.

21:00.389 --> 21:01.608
- Lap pad.

21:04.959 --> 21:06.395
How'd it go?

21:06.439 --> 21:07.744
- Rash outlined.

21:07.788 --> 21:10.356
Lungs and oropharynx clear.

21:10.399 --> 21:12.401
- What about
the tympanic membrane?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.493
Eardrum.

21:17.537 --> 21:19.669
- Yes, clear.
I think.

21:19.713 --> 21:21.541
- You think?
- It was.

21:21.584 --> 21:23.760
- Good.
Well, come on over.

21:23.804 --> 21:25.719
Show us some more
of that all-star suturing.

21:27.373 --> 21:29.331
Dr. Duke?

21:34.380 --> 21:35.337
We're waiting.

21:39.472 --> 21:43.302
- Okay,
so of the approved books...

21:44.999 --> 21:47.306
For this class, I have...

21:48.568 --> 21:49.743
I have "Aladdin."

21:49.786 --> 21:50.874
- Whoo!
- Okay, yeah.

21:50.918 --> 21:53.616
- Yeah, yeah, good movie.

21:53.660 --> 21:55.575
Fun movie.
Kids' movie, really.

21:55.618 --> 21:57.054
Um...

21:57.098 --> 21:58.839
any dads in the house?
Where my dads at?

21:58.882 --> 22:02.712
- Yo, what's "Aladdin"
gonna teach us about anything?

22:02.756 --> 22:04.540
- Well, you see, I...

22:07.674 --> 22:11.634
Aladdin didn't--he didn't
start out as a prince, right?

22:12.592 --> 22:13.897
That's not where
it began for him,

22:13.941 --> 22:15.682
but he did have some skills.

22:15.725 --> 22:17.466
- He was a hustler.

22:17.510 --> 22:18.989
- Yeah.
Yes, thank you, Bijan. Yeah.

22:19.033 --> 22:20.991
- And the book
isn't called "Aladdin."

22:21.035 --> 22:23.516
It's "1,001 Arabian Nights."

22:24.691 --> 22:27.346
- Yeah, no, correct again.
Thank you.

22:27.389 --> 22:28.825
Good for you.

22:28.869 --> 22:30.653
You're right, though.
Aladdin was a hustler

22:30.697 --> 22:31.915
and a thief.

22:31.959 --> 22:33.830
But he figured out
how to use those things

22:33.874 --> 22:35.658
and turned them
into a benefit for his life.

22:35.702 --> 22:37.747
- Aladdin goes legit.
- Yes!

22:38.966 --> 22:40.097
Yeah, laugh it up.
He's right.

22:40.141 --> 22:42.491
Wonderfully stated.
Yes, he goes legit.

22:42.535 --> 22:46.582
Aladdin turns his perceived
weaknesses into an advantage.

22:46.626 --> 22:47.975
Right?
Do you understand that?

22:48.018 --> 22:49.368
So whatever you did,
whatever it was

22:49.411 --> 22:50.847
to get into Rikers can be used

22:50.891 --> 22:53.110
as a legitimate skill set
when you get out.

22:53.154 --> 22:55.156
- My boy Luis can use
his hot-wire expertise

22:55.199 --> 22:56.679
to help humanity.

22:56.723 --> 22:58.028
Come on, man.

22:58.072 --> 23:00.466
- Well, no, hang on, now.
Luis, tell me something.

23:00.509 --> 23:02.424
Is it easy to hot-wire a car?

23:02.468 --> 23:04.600
Like, could anybody do it?
- No, bro.

23:04.644 --> 23:05.775
I mean,
if you're not careful,

23:05.819 --> 23:07.516
you could shock
the hell out yourself.

23:07.560 --> 23:09.431
But not me, though, 'cause,
you know, I got the touch.

23:09.475 --> 23:10.780
- I bet you do.

23:10.824 --> 23:13.957
So maybe I'm looking
at a future electrician here.

23:15.132 --> 23:17.700
- Yo, you mean like
I'd be working for the city.

23:17.744 --> 23:19.441
- Sure.
- Like, I could be getting paid

23:19.485 --> 23:20.442
that union money.

23:20.486 --> 23:21.878
- Why not?
- Yeah!

23:21.922 --> 23:23.140
- There you go.
Why not?

23:23.184 --> 23:25.621
Why not? Why not?
Yes, okay.

23:25.665 --> 23:27.841
Who else?
Who else do I got?

23:28.755 --> 23:30.060
Yeah, go.

23:30.104 --> 23:32.846
- I got caught moving product.

23:32.889 --> 23:35.762
- So I imagine
in your line of work,

23:35.805 --> 23:38.721
a lot of people sell...

23:38.765 --> 23:40.070
product, right?

23:40.114 --> 23:42.464
So what did you do
to distinguish yourself?

23:42.508 --> 23:45.075
- Hmm, I never came up short.

23:45.119 --> 23:47.077
My suppliers always trusted me
with the good stuff.

23:47.121 --> 23:48.601
- Great.
That's great.

23:48.644 --> 23:49.645
So it sounds like
you could move

23:49.689 --> 23:50.907
any expensive product, right?

23:50.951 --> 23:52.822
You could be
a high-end car salesman.

23:52.866 --> 23:54.737
- Yo, I'm done with this fool.

23:54.781 --> 23:56.609
- Yo, yo!

23:56.652 --> 23:57.610
- No, no, no, wait, wait!

23:59.960 --> 24:02.528
All right, okay.
- Out, out!

24:02.571 --> 24:03.746
Let's go!

24:03.790 --> 24:06.053
Up! Everybody up!

24:06.096 --> 24:08.229
Up!

24:08.272 --> 24:11.624
Class is over!

24:14.801 --> 24:16.106
- I don't think
that's sanitary.

24:16.150 --> 24:17.543
- Yeah, well,
it's chew this gum

24:17.586 --> 24:18.718
or punch someone in the face.

24:18.761 --> 24:20.110
- Are those really
your only two options?

24:20.154 --> 24:21.460
- Dr. Bloom.

24:21.503 --> 24:22.591
- Reynolds give you
another assignment?

24:22.635 --> 24:23.810
- Actually, I was here
to see Mr. Talis.

24:23.853 --> 24:25.942
- Discharged. Why?

24:25.986 --> 24:27.683
- Just wanted to see...

24:27.727 --> 24:29.119
just wanted to say bye.

24:29.163 --> 24:31.165
He's a nice man.
- Yes, he is.

24:36.823 --> 24:38.825
- Okay.
- Thank you.

24:50.010 --> 24:52.882
- I shouldn't have said that.

24:52.926 --> 24:54.971
- Said what?

24:55.015 --> 24:56.625
- That you were lucky.

24:58.932 --> 25:01.195
After everything
that you've been through.

25:01.238 --> 25:03.110
- Yeah, but I am lucky.

25:03.153 --> 25:05.808
I'm in the 5%.

25:05.852 --> 25:07.680
- That's not what I meant.

25:10.030 --> 25:11.684
And you know that.

25:14.643 --> 25:16.776
You can talk to me.

25:16.819 --> 25:17.820
You've always talked to me.

25:17.864 --> 25:19.169
- Stop.

25:21.650 --> 25:22.999
- It's hard to know
what to say.

25:23.043 --> 25:26.176
- I don't want you
to say anything.

25:26.220 --> 25:28.178
It actually makes it worse

25:28.222 --> 25:32.182
when people say something,
so just, please...

25:32.226 --> 25:34.228
Don't.

25:35.838 --> 25:37.057
Getting off here?

25:37.100 --> 25:38.580
- No.
- No?

25:46.980 --> 25:48.242
- What the hell happened?

25:48.285 --> 25:49.591
- Started seizing
in the subway.

25:49.635 --> 25:51.288
Finger stick glucose 120.

25:51.332 --> 25:53.247
- Okay, get him to Trauma One
and push two milligrams Ativan.

25:53.290 --> 25:54.727
- Got it.

25:55.292 --> 25:56.598
- Ativan on board.

25:56.642 --> 25:58.818
- BP 108 over 60.

25:59.862 --> 26:01.864
- He stopped seizing.
Stabilized.

26:01.908 --> 26:02.909
- Sat 94%.

26:06.913 --> 26:10.003
- Airway clear.
No tongue bite.

26:10.873 --> 26:12.962
- He has a vesicle
on his tympanic membrane.

26:13.006 --> 26:14.964
The shingles advanced
to Ramsay Hunt syndrome.

26:15.008 --> 26:17.837
He has a herpetic infection
throughout his whole body.

26:17.880 --> 26:19.055
- How did we miss that?

26:19.099 --> 26:21.057
- Get Reynolds down here now.

26:25.496 --> 26:28.412
- So when I finished
going through the census data,

26:28.456 --> 26:30.937
I discovered that 81 people
chose not to fill it out,

26:30.980 --> 26:32.939
17 people defaced the census

26:32.982 --> 26:35.028
with decidedly
colorful language,

26:35.071 --> 26:36.595
and one person simply wrote,

26:36.638 --> 26:39.772
"I am not your blanking
assistant."

26:39.815 --> 26:43.036
So by using
the process of elimination,

26:43.079 --> 26:44.515
here we are.

26:44.559 --> 26:45.647
- So, what,
we didn't take a census

26:45.691 --> 26:46.735
and now we're in trouble?

26:46.779 --> 26:47.867
- No, no, nobody's in trouble.

26:47.910 --> 26:49.695
I just want to know
why 60 questions

26:49.738 --> 26:51.218
made y'all so angry.

26:51.261 --> 26:53.612
- Because I have too much work
to answer 60 questions,

26:53.655 --> 26:55.048
and I have too much work
to be here right now

26:55.091 --> 26:57.093
explaining why
I don't have time to be here.

26:57.137 --> 26:59.792
- Okay, makes sense.
Anybody else?

26:59.835 --> 27:01.837
- If I don't have time
to go to my kids' PTA meetings,

27:01.881 --> 27:03.926
I don't have time
to take an unofficial survey

27:03.970 --> 27:05.711
so my boss can get to know me.

27:05.754 --> 27:07.103
- That's fair.
- Yeah.

27:07.147 --> 27:08.888
- Technically,
I don't even work for you.

27:08.931 --> 27:10.803
I work for the city.

27:10.846 --> 27:12.631
- You always call me
Sandra Fall from billing,

27:12.674 --> 27:13.806
so you know what my job is,

27:13.849 --> 27:15.459
yet you spent all day
making me do

27:15.503 --> 27:16.852
someone else's job too.

27:16.896 --> 27:18.114
I don't have time
for that, Max.

27:18.158 --> 27:20.029
None of us have time.

27:21.596 --> 27:22.858
- So it's time.

27:22.902 --> 27:24.425
- For what?

27:24.468 --> 27:26.645
- No, no, no, the common thread
between everyone.

27:26.688 --> 27:31.084
All the inefficiencies
and the, you know, complaints

27:31.127 --> 27:32.607
and the dissatisfaction,

27:32.651 --> 27:33.695
it's all...

27:33.739 --> 27:35.697
it's all because of time.

27:35.741 --> 27:37.917
- So how are you
gonna fix time?

27:42.138 --> 27:44.445
- Ramsay Hunt syndrome.
- Okay, hey, hey, hang on.

27:44.488 --> 27:46.055
- Disseminated
herpetic infection.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.709
It could not be clearer,

27:47.753 --> 27:49.537
yet somehow it was missed
by your department.

27:49.580 --> 27:50.669
- Okay, let's walk back
the accusations.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.148
- You are lucky Mr. Talis

27:52.192 --> 27:54.150
didn't seize while driving
a school bus full of kids.

27:54.194 --> 27:55.543
- I gave Dr. Duke
the checklist, right?

27:55.586 --> 27:56.979
And he said he checked it.
- Well, he couldn't have.

27:57.023 --> 27:58.720
Otherwise,
we wouldn't be here right now.

27:58.764 --> 28:00.504
Mr. Talis wouldn't be here.

28:00.548 --> 28:01.723
- Duke?

28:01.767 --> 28:03.159
- Yes, I went through
the checklist.

28:03.203 --> 28:05.509
- Did you look in his ear?
- He said he looked.

28:05.553 --> 28:06.859
- He has a vesicle
on his eardrum.

28:06.902 --> 28:08.425
If he'd actually
bothered to look,

28:08.469 --> 28:09.688
he would've seen it too.

28:09.731 --> 28:10.863
- It must not have been there
at the time.

28:10.906 --> 28:12.081
- There is no way
it grew in two hours.

28:12.125 --> 28:13.126
- Okay, if Dr. Duke
said he looked,

28:13.169 --> 28:14.736
then he looked.
- Or he's lying.

28:14.780 --> 28:15.955
- Back off!

28:15.998 --> 28:17.565
All right, this is my intern
you're accusing.

28:17.608 --> 28:19.001
If there's any blame
to be dished out,

28:19.045 --> 28:20.611
I'll do the dishing.

28:20.655 --> 28:22.744
- Clean up your house, Floyd.

28:30.491 --> 28:32.580
- I have the results.
- And?

28:32.623 --> 28:34.930
- 17 of our patients qualify.

28:34.974 --> 28:36.192
- Oh, my God.

28:36.236 --> 28:37.759
That's amazing.

28:37.803 --> 28:39.543
- I'll notify
the insurance companies,

28:39.587 --> 28:42.024
some of whom probably haven't
even had a claim like this.

28:42.068 --> 28:44.592
- Wait, there's no one
from the euchre group.

28:45.767 --> 28:48.161
Willow Yun, Millie Tamberlay,
Mike Kiggens.

28:48.204 --> 28:50.990
- No, none of them
were eligible.

28:54.602 --> 28:56.647
Why are they called
the euchre group?

28:58.911 --> 29:01.087
- They used to play...

29:01.130 --> 29:04.003
when there were four of them.

29:04.046 --> 29:06.875
And then Max got better,
and they...

29:06.919 --> 29:09.051
they stopped.

29:09.095 --> 29:10.226
- You're close to them.

29:12.141 --> 29:14.187
Then they should hear it
from you

29:14.230 --> 29:15.884
that they didn't qualify.

29:17.103 --> 29:18.800
- Of course.

29:18.844 --> 29:20.671
- I'll notify the ones who did.

29:20.715 --> 29:22.761
See? What'd I tell you?

29:22.804 --> 29:25.154
- That we make a great team.

29:27.853 --> 29:28.984
Yeah.

29:39.821 --> 29:43.999
- Now, why in the world did I
think it was called "Aladdin"?

29:45.566 --> 29:48.699
- Nobody reads the book
if there's a movie.

29:50.092 --> 29:53.095
- That is the sad truth,
isn't it?

29:54.880 --> 29:58.666
Listen, I don't feel like we
had a chance to finish earlier.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.581
- You're wasting your time.

30:01.234 --> 30:02.844
- I don't think I am.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.848
- Know why I'm here?

30:06.892 --> 30:08.241
In the hospital?

30:08.284 --> 30:09.851
- I don't.

30:09.895 --> 30:11.244
- I swallowed a fork

30:11.287 --> 30:13.072
for just a couple days
out of Rikers.

30:14.073 --> 30:16.162
A fork.

30:16.205 --> 30:18.991
'Cause recovering from surgery
is my idea of a vacation.

30:22.211 --> 30:25.040
- Bijan, we all have
something to offer.

30:25.084 --> 30:28.696
- Nah. That's what you say
to give yourself hope.

30:28.739 --> 30:30.132
- Okay.

30:30.176 --> 30:32.569
Well, then prove me wrong.

30:32.613 --> 30:34.658
- How I'ma do that?

30:34.702 --> 30:36.660
- When you get out, you're
gonna have an opportunity--

30:36.704 --> 30:38.532
- You even read my file?

30:38.575 --> 30:40.534
- When you get out--
- Yo, I'm never getting out.

30:40.577 --> 30:42.275
I'm in for life.

30:42.318 --> 30:46.540
Not one but two life sentences
for a crime I did commit.

30:48.759 --> 30:51.197
Now tell me again
I have something to offer.

30:58.247 --> 30:59.553
- I just wanted
to tell you how hard

30:59.596 --> 31:00.902
I been practicing
my stitching.

31:00.946 --> 31:02.556
It's gonna be
even better than before.

31:02.599 --> 31:05.211
- Lie again,
you're gone for good.

31:08.736 --> 31:10.346
- I forgot to check the ear.

31:10.390 --> 31:11.957
- And you had the nerve
to lie to me about it.

31:12.000 --> 31:13.219
- At first,
I couldn't remember,

31:13.262 --> 31:14.307
but when I realized my mistake,

31:14.350 --> 31:15.656
I tried to go back and fix it,

31:15.699 --> 31:16.657
but the patient
was already gone.

31:16.700 --> 31:18.354
- Why didn't you come to me?

31:18.398 --> 31:19.878
- I panicked.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.357
And then I thought
since all the other

31:21.401 --> 31:24.056
diagnoses were negative
that the ear would be too.

31:24.099 --> 31:25.927
- How'd that work out for you?

31:26.797 --> 31:28.147
- I just wanted to impress you.

31:28.190 --> 31:29.844
- Well, you didn't.

31:31.193 --> 31:32.760
- Maybe I shouldn't
even be here.

31:32.803 --> 31:34.980
- Hey, don't play
the sympathy card.

31:35.023 --> 31:37.025
Because you deserve to be here.

31:37.069 --> 31:38.984
Those skills you exhibited
in that OR are rare.

31:39.027 --> 31:41.116
You have a gift.

31:41.160 --> 31:43.945
But you're an intern,
and you're gonna make mistakes.

31:43.989 --> 31:45.947
Next time, own them.

31:48.994 --> 31:50.038
- Wait, you're not...

31:50.082 --> 31:51.300
you're not gonna report me?

31:53.128 --> 31:54.695
- I gave you
too much responsibility,

31:54.738 --> 31:56.740
and you weren't ready.

31:56.784 --> 31:58.220
That's on me.

32:00.005 --> 32:01.310
- And Dr. Bloom?

32:06.098 --> 32:08.927
- A mistake like this could
derail your whole career.

32:13.061 --> 32:14.758
This stays between us.

32:19.894 --> 32:21.374
- Thank you, Dr. Reynolds.

32:38.173 --> 32:39.740
- âª Took the breath

32:39.783 --> 32:40.828
- Max.

32:40.871 --> 32:43.396
- âª From my open mouth

32:43.439 --> 32:44.963
- Dr. Sharpe said I could
find you here

32:45.006 --> 32:48.096
if I can't find you
anywhere else.

32:48.140 --> 32:50.838
- âª In circles
somewhere else âª

32:50.881 --> 32:54.146
- How can I help?

32:54.189 --> 32:55.321
- You know the one thing
on the census

32:55.364 --> 32:57.323
that everyone has in common?

32:57.366 --> 32:59.890
- âª When your love was home,
storing up âª

32:59.934 --> 33:01.327
- Not enough time.

33:01.370 --> 33:02.328
- âª On your summer glow

33:02.371 --> 33:04.895
âª You went

33:04.939 --> 33:09.161
âª In search of someone else

33:09.204 --> 33:11.380
- You know, when I...

33:11.424 --> 33:14.688
when I lost my wife...

33:14.731 --> 33:16.342
I was destroyed,

33:16.385 --> 33:18.344
like...

33:18.387 --> 33:21.869
parts of me shattered.

33:21.912 --> 33:26.482
So I...I started cooking.

33:26.526 --> 33:29.181
Her recipes.

33:29.224 --> 33:33.098
All the meals
she ever cooked for me.

33:33.141 --> 33:35.056
The taste
brought back memories.

33:35.100 --> 33:37.798
- âª My dear

33:37.841 --> 33:40.366
- Memories brought back...

33:40.409 --> 33:41.889
her.

33:41.932 --> 33:43.064
40 years of marriage,

33:43.108 --> 33:46.894
and I'm still cooking
her meals.

33:46.937 --> 33:52.900
You know, every culture offers
you guidance on how to grieve.

33:52.943 --> 33:55.207
Some people build shrines.

33:55.250 --> 33:57.165
Some tear their clothes.

33:57.209 --> 34:00.168
Some even dance in the streets.

34:00.212 --> 34:03.215
Everybody does something,
and...

34:03.258 --> 34:05.173
and you have not done anything,
and I'm...

34:05.217 --> 34:06.348
I'm worried.

34:08.437 --> 34:12.093
- âª Anchor up to me, love

34:12.137 --> 34:14.095
- You don't think
I want to grieve?

34:16.445 --> 34:18.882
You don't think
I want to scream

34:18.926 --> 34:21.233
every time I walk
into this hospital?

34:23.365 --> 34:26.238
- âª Oh, anchor up to me

34:26.281 --> 34:28.327
- Then I see...

34:28.370 --> 34:31.069
Luna, and I to change
her diaper.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.766
I have to make her bottle.

34:32.809 --> 34:33.941
- âª My love

34:33.984 --> 34:35.247
- So...

34:35.290 --> 34:38.467
if I let myself...

34:38.511 --> 34:40.034
grieve...

34:40.078 --> 34:42.428
you know, truly give in,
then...

34:45.474 --> 34:47.128
I won't ever come out.

34:51.828 --> 34:53.308
And I'm all she has left.

35:06.278 --> 35:07.801
- Don't overextend.

35:07.844 --> 35:09.368
Find your balance.

35:09.411 --> 35:11.283
- It hurts.

35:11.326 --> 35:14.895
- Watching you push through
this difficult process is--

35:14.938 --> 35:19.160
how else to put it--
an inspiration.

35:19.204 --> 35:21.989
- Do you know what?
I have tried everything

35:22.032 --> 35:24.600
to get my mind off the pain--

35:24.644 --> 35:26.646
your stupid squishy ball,

35:26.689 --> 35:29.692
fidget spinners,
rubber bands,

35:29.736 --> 35:31.955
gum--and nothing works.

35:31.999 --> 35:33.957
- Not even the gum?

35:34.001 --> 35:35.742
Well, that's a huge
step back for medicine.

35:35.785 --> 35:37.047
- Hey, you know what?

35:37.091 --> 35:39.963
Instead of standing there
grinning like an idiot

35:40.007 --> 35:42.052
and casually insulting my limp,

35:42.096 --> 35:44.838
why don't you do something
that actually helps?

36:01.376 --> 36:03.248
- Range of motion
is suddenly improving.

36:03.291 --> 36:06.294
- Shut up.
- Mm.

36:10.037 --> 36:12.213
Nurse Chatwell, pick up 1317.

36:12.257 --> 36:15.042
Nurse Chatwell,
please pick up 1317.

36:19.046 --> 36:21.222
- Hey, I'm sorry.

36:21.266 --> 36:23.703
I overreacted earlier.

36:23.746 --> 36:28.011
It's just my leg makes
my short fuse even shorter,

36:28.055 --> 36:30.753
which is really, really short.

36:32.015 --> 36:33.930
And I took it out
on your intern.

36:33.974 --> 36:36.237
It won't happen again.

36:40.937 --> 36:42.112
- Appreciate it.

36:45.812 --> 36:47.988
You seem better.

36:48.031 --> 36:50.382
- Yeah?

36:50.425 --> 36:52.340
I think I found something
that helps.

36:58.085 --> 37:01.044
- I hate disappointing you
like this.

37:02.394 --> 37:04.396
- You said it was a long shot.

37:04.439 --> 37:06.354
- I know.

37:06.398 --> 37:08.182
But I gave you hope.

37:08.226 --> 37:11.707
- Eh, negative thinkers
are always right...

37:11.751 --> 37:13.927
or pleasantly surprised.

37:13.970 --> 37:15.972
- I knew it wasn't gonna be me.

37:16.016 --> 37:18.758
It was fun to imagine.

37:18.801 --> 37:20.238
But chemo is working.

37:20.281 --> 37:22.065
I can't complain.

37:24.329 --> 37:26.983
- Dr. Sharpe,
I think you're the only one

37:27.027 --> 37:28.942
that got their hopes up.

37:32.946 --> 37:34.904
- Do you still
have a deck of cards?

37:34.948 --> 37:36.254
- Always.

37:36.297 --> 37:38.430
But you need four
to play euchre.

37:40.301 --> 37:42.303
- Well, deal me in.

37:47.395 --> 37:48.527
- Have you ever played?

37:48.570 --> 37:50.529
- Oh, I'm kind of sharp.

38:01.148 --> 38:02.541
- Hi, hey, excuse me.

38:02.584 --> 38:03.977
Hi, sorry.
Hi, sorry.

38:04.020 --> 38:05.326
Can I have one minute with him?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.110
- One minute.
- That's all I need.

38:07.154 --> 38:09.809
Bijan, may I?

38:09.852 --> 38:11.201
- Can't you just
leave me alone?

38:11.245 --> 38:13.334
- I'm a Scorpio: incredibly
stubborn, loves teasing.

38:13.378 --> 38:15.858
Anyway, I've been thinking
a lot about what happened,

38:15.902 --> 38:18.470
and no matter what you did,

38:18.513 --> 38:21.516
no matter how bad it was...

38:21.560 --> 38:22.865
you're so smart.

38:22.909 --> 38:24.824
- You don't know what I did.

38:24.867 --> 38:28.436
- You are not your crime.

38:28.480 --> 38:32.440
That doesn't make up
who you are.

38:32.484 --> 38:35.138
You are smart.

38:35.182 --> 38:36.444
You read
"1,001 Arabian Nights."

38:36.488 --> 38:38.577
Those inmates in there,
they listen to you.

38:38.620 --> 38:39.926
They respect you.

38:39.969 --> 38:41.319
- So what?

38:41.362 --> 38:43.451
What good is that
where I'm going?

38:43.495 --> 38:45.105
- Well, I contacted
a program manager at Rikers,

38:45.148 --> 38:46.280
and I gave him your name.

38:46.324 --> 38:47.542
- Nah, I'm done
with those programs.

38:47.586 --> 38:49.109
I don't want to take
more classes.

38:49.152 --> 38:50.284
- No, no, no, you're not...

38:50.328 --> 38:52.460
you're not
gonna take the classes.

38:52.504 --> 38:54.201
You're gonna
learn to teach them.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.552
Yeah, so many guys in there,
they don't know how to read.

38:57.596 --> 38:58.988
They're done
with programs too.

38:59.032 --> 39:01.208
They hate that stuff, but...

39:01.251 --> 39:03.993
if it was coming from you...

39:04.037 --> 39:05.473
- You want me to teach?

39:05.517 --> 39:07.257
- Yeah.

39:08.302 --> 39:11.392
So that your life,
what you have to offer,

39:11.436 --> 39:13.176
which is a lot,

39:13.220 --> 39:17.485
can reverberate well outside
the walls of any prison.

39:21.446 --> 39:23.230
What's going on?
What are you thinking?

39:27.016 --> 39:30.063
- No one ever told me
I was smart.

39:33.675 --> 39:36.199
- All right, come on.

39:36.243 --> 39:37.200
Let's go.

39:54.566 --> 39:55.871
- Excuse me.

39:55.915 --> 39:57.351
I'm looking for my bus driver.

39:57.395 --> 39:59.658
- Bus driver's in 4223.

39:59.701 --> 40:00.920
- Thanks.

40:05.620 --> 40:07.535
- That's it.

40:07.579 --> 40:09.494
- I did it.
I solved time.

40:09.537 --> 40:11.191
- And how did you do that?

40:11.234 --> 40:12.975
- With a bus.
- A bus?

40:13.019 --> 40:14.542
- Yeah.
Well, buses, to be exact.

40:14.586 --> 40:16.892
But for the same cost
of public transportation,

40:16.936 --> 40:18.416
our employees
can pool their money,

40:18.459 --> 40:20.330
charter a bus to New Amsterdam

40:20.374 --> 40:22.637
from stations
in their own neighborhoods.

40:22.681 --> 40:25.205
So many of our employees have
a two-hour commute each way,

40:25.248 --> 40:27.076
and it's because
they're waiting for transfers,

40:27.120 --> 40:28.251
dealing with delays.

40:28.295 --> 40:30.297
Now it becomes
a one-hour commute

40:30.340 --> 40:32.560
because it's direct.

40:32.604 --> 40:35.258
With two extra hours
in their day,

40:35.302 --> 40:37.086
our employees
can get more sleep,

40:37.130 --> 40:38.958
either at home
or on a bus

40:39.001 --> 40:40.525
that doesn't have a bunch
of stops and transfers

40:40.568 --> 40:42.440
keeping them awake.

40:42.483 --> 40:44.485
With two extra hours,
our employees can make it home

40:44.529 --> 40:47.270
in time to eat dinner
with their families.

40:47.314 --> 40:48.924
They'll have time
to go grocery shopping,

40:48.968 --> 40:51.971
time to cook,
time to relax with the people

40:52.014 --> 40:54.669
that they're working
so hard for.

40:54.713 --> 40:56.541
With two extra hours,
they'll have time

40:56.584 --> 40:57.977
for self-care,

40:58.020 --> 41:00.719
time to exercise, read.

41:00.762 --> 41:02.547
So when they get here,
they'll be focused, alert,

41:02.590 --> 41:06.507
and ready to help
those who need it the most:

41:06.551 --> 41:07.726
our patients.

41:07.769 --> 41:11.251
- You solved time...
with a bus.

41:11.294 --> 41:12.731
- I guess I did.

41:17.649 --> 41:21.609
- âª You and me
belong together âª

41:21.653 --> 41:25.483
- He walks like Max.
He talks like Max.

41:25.526 --> 41:28.137
But...
- I know.

41:28.181 --> 41:30.139
- He isn't grieving, Vijay.

41:30.183 --> 41:33.316
- I thought the same.

41:33.360 --> 41:35.362
But we are wrong.

41:35.405 --> 41:38.017
Max is grieving...

41:38.060 --> 41:40.149
in his own way,

41:40.193 --> 41:42.282
whether he knows it or not.

41:45.198 --> 41:47.983
- âª You and me

41:48.027 --> 41:50.682
âª Belong together

41:54.294 --> 41:57.297
âª You and me

41:57.340 --> 42:00.692
âª Belong together

42:05.566 --> 42:07.002
Hey.

42:07.046 --> 42:08.482
- Hey, sweetie,
how was your day?

42:08.526 --> 42:10.745
Hi.

42:10.789 --> 42:12.704
Oh!

42:12.747 --> 42:14.357
Hi.
