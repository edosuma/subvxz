WEBVTT

01:20.563 --> 01:21.909
Did you get all that?

01:21.943 --> 01:23.083
Oh, I got it.

01:23.117 --> 01:24.877
And I plan on using
it as evidence

01:24.912 --> 01:26.224
when the men in
the white lab coats

01:26.258 --> 01:28.433
finally come to take you home.

01:29.710 --> 01:32.057
Hey, it's for science,
my psychology final,

01:32.092 --> 01:35.095
a study in the willingness
for humans to engage in joy.

01:35.129 --> 01:36.337
Does it matter

01:36.372 --> 01:37.476
that classes don't
start till tomorrow

01:37.511 --> 01:38.822
or that you haven't signed up

01:38.857 --> 01:40.376
for a psych class this semester?

01:40.410 --> 01:41.894
I might take one someday.

01:41.929 --> 01:44.725
Besides, be prepared, that's
the Girl Scout's motto.

01:44.759 --> 01:46.175
That's the Boy Scout's motto.

01:47.210 --> 01:49.109
Then what's the Girl Scout's?

01:49.143 --> 01:50.765
Eat more cookies.

01:50.800 --> 01:52.042
You know?

01:52.077 --> 01:53.251
Can you believe how many
people wouldn't dance?

01:53.285 --> 01:54.735
I know.

01:54.769 --> 01:57.634
It was like there was an
outbreak of sanity on campus.

01:57.669 --> 02:00.050
Dance like no one
is watching people!

02:00.085 --> 02:02.743
Says the girl that had
me record said dancing.

02:02.777 --> 02:05.401
Dance like no one but
Kate is watching, people.

02:05.435 --> 02:07.955
That'll make all
the difference.

02:07.989 --> 02:09.543
Ooh.
Ooh, is it in there?

02:09.577 --> 02:10.406
Hmm hmm.

02:11.683 --> 02:13.063
- Oh, come on.
- Aw.

02:14.168 --> 02:16.653
Hey, any chance you saw this?

02:16.688 --> 02:19.208
Juliet? I read
everything she writes.

02:19.242 --> 02:21.934
Her romance column got
me through freshman year.

02:21.969 --> 02:24.834
So you like this
Juliet person?

02:24.868 --> 02:27.043
Tell me what is she
saying this time?

02:27.077 --> 02:29.459
Sure, there are walls
between men and women,

02:29.494 --> 02:31.841
but the true Romeo
leaps the garden walls

02:31.875 --> 02:33.083
waiting for that true love,

02:33.118 --> 02:34.533
the one willing
to risk the blade,

02:34.568 --> 02:36.432
is the only road to happiness.

02:36.466 --> 02:38.986
Women, wait for the real Romeo.

02:39.020 --> 02:41.195
I love hearing
those words out loud.

02:41.230 --> 02:43.818
So tell me, is this
bordering on genius

02:43.853 --> 02:45.717
or like extreme genius?

02:45.751 --> 02:46.718
Oh, good grief, shameless.

02:46.752 --> 02:48.029
We will talk later.

02:49.238 --> 02:51.171
Next, you'll be
signing autographs.

02:51.205 --> 02:52.827
Have my 8x10s ready to go.

02:52.862 --> 02:55.071
The anonymous love guru.

02:55.105 --> 02:56.935
You should try
romance, sometime.

02:56.969 --> 02:58.005
I did once.

02:58.039 --> 03:00.145
Bobby Butler, second grade.

03:00.180 --> 03:01.767
It was the worst
half hour of my life.

03:01.802 --> 03:04.805
I still think I have
cooties.

03:04.839 --> 03:06.841
I was kidding about the cooties.

03:06.876 --> 03:07.842
I've gotta go home.

03:07.877 --> 03:09.223
- Is everything okay?
- Yes!

03:10.431 --> 03:11.605
Dorms that way.

03:11.639 --> 03:13.400
Home,
home, I'll text you.

03:17.231 --> 03:18.646
- Hi!
- Mom.

03:18.681 --> 03:20.130
You're back home already.

03:20.165 --> 03:22.167
How quickly did you go
through your laundry, hmm?

03:23.272 --> 03:24.445
You're a finalist.

03:24.480 --> 03:26.033
That's right!

03:26.067 --> 03:28.898
Read it and weep,
journalism world.

03:28.932 --> 03:30.727
The Pealy Scholarship?

03:30.762 --> 03:32.453
That's a full ride
to grad school.

03:32.488 --> 03:33.385
Really?

03:33.420 --> 03:34.662
You'd think I would know that

03:34.697 --> 03:36.146
since I'm the one
that applied, but.

03:36.181 --> 03:38.425
Sorry, this is
a lot to process.

03:38.459 --> 03:39.598
Is this from your columns?

03:39.633 --> 03:40.910
I think so.

03:40.944 --> 03:42.705
Professor Murrow said my
articles might be enough

03:42.739 --> 03:44.120
to put me over the edge.

03:44.154 --> 03:45.604
Oh, I wish...

03:47.296 --> 03:49.677
You know, dad would
be so proud of you.

03:49.712 --> 03:50.644
Me?

03:50.678 --> 03:53.094
He would be so proud of you.

03:53.129 --> 03:55.545
I mean, going back to
school at your age.

03:55.580 --> 03:57.513
At my age?

03:57.547 --> 03:59.894
- I'm not saying you're old.
- Hmm hmm.

03:59.929 --> 04:02.069
I mean, you are ancient.

04:02.103 --> 04:03.243
I'm not saying it.

04:04.727 --> 04:07.454
What I'm saying is, Dad
would be so proud of you.

04:07.488 --> 04:09.041
Mm, you are right about that.

04:09.076 --> 04:11.181
He had the gift of
encouragement.

04:11.216 --> 04:13.598
Well, you two were
the perfect pair.

04:13.632 --> 04:15.979
Mm.

04:16.014 --> 04:18.534
Hold up, mom, is
this your textbook?

04:18.568 --> 04:19.811
Yeah.

04:19.845 --> 04:21.226
My gosh, he would not
have encouraged this.

04:21.261 --> 04:22.607
You already read
the whole thing?

04:22.641 --> 04:23.884
Ah huh.

04:23.918 --> 04:25.437
Classes don't even
start until tomorrow.

04:25.472 --> 04:28.337
I believe in the Girl
Scout motto, be prepared.

04:28.371 --> 04:29.717
That's the Boy Scouts motto.

04:29.752 --> 04:31.132
What's the Girl Scout motto?

04:31.167 --> 04:32.789
Always store your Thin
Mints in the freezer.

04:32.824 --> 04:35.758
Ooh, practical,
those Girl Scouts.

04:35.792 --> 04:36.759
But mom, seriously?

04:36.793 --> 04:38.208
You have to loosen up.

04:38.243 --> 04:40.418
You're gonna be among
my people tomorrow

04:40.452 --> 04:41.902
and we do not read
entire textbooks

04:41.936 --> 04:43.386
before the start
of the semester.

04:43.421 --> 04:44.698
Oh really, what do you do?

04:44.732 --> 04:46.078
Live life.

04:46.113 --> 04:47.217
Like YOLO, mom.

04:47.252 --> 04:48.391
What is YOLO?

04:48.426 --> 04:49.323
You something something.

04:49.358 --> 04:51.325
You only laugh out...

04:51.360 --> 04:54.294
You know, the point is, you
have to start living life.

04:54.328 --> 04:55.640
It's expected of all
college students.

04:55.674 --> 04:57.642
I live life.

04:57.676 --> 05:00.438
Color-coordinated,
schedule down to the details

05:00.472 --> 05:02.371
and neatly stacked in rows.

05:02.405 --> 05:03.786
The good life.

05:03.820 --> 05:05.753
Mother, make me proud.

05:05.788 --> 05:07.341
Promise me that tomorrow,

05:07.376 --> 05:10.310
you will do one wild
and crazy thing.

05:10.344 --> 05:11.690
Oh, wild and crazy?

05:11.725 --> 05:13.243
Like your freshman year?

05:13.278 --> 05:15.280
Yeah, not that crazy.

05:15.315 --> 05:17.144
And I paid back the bail money.

05:17.178 --> 05:22.149
So what does my wild and
wise daughter want me to do?

05:23.046 --> 05:26.326
Hmm, I don't know.

05:26.360 --> 05:27.706
The universe will tell you.

05:27.741 --> 05:28.983
Oh, dear.

05:29.018 --> 05:31.123
Just wait for your
moment and go with it.

05:31.158 --> 05:32.711
But you have to promise me

05:32.746 --> 05:35.749
that you will do this
one wild and crazy thing.

05:35.783 --> 05:38.096
If I promise

05:38.130 --> 05:41.410
to do one crazy thing,

05:41.444 --> 05:44.171
do you promise to do
one sensible thing?

05:45.103 --> 05:46.276
- Done?
- Oh?

05:46.311 --> 05:48.900
I always bring my
laundry home to to you.

05:48.934 --> 05:50.453
Touche.

05:53.905 --> 05:54.733
It's adorable.

05:54.768 --> 05:55.941
After all this time,

05:55.976 --> 05:57.115
she still lights up
when talking about him.

05:57.149 --> 05:58.944
You think she'll
ever find someone else?

05:58.979 --> 06:01.153
I pity the fool who
tries to fill his shoes.

06:01.188 --> 06:02.707
He completed her.

06:02.741 --> 06:05.710
Are you quoting a romance
movie or is that the A-Team?

06:05.744 --> 06:08.022
I was thinking of the
line from the Silmarillion.

06:08.057 --> 06:09.230
All have their worth

06:09.265 --> 06:10.749
and each contributes
to the worth of others.

06:10.784 --> 06:12.164
Right,

06:12.199 --> 06:14.546
'cause haven't we all
memorized the Cinnamonroll-ian?

06:14.581 --> 06:16.065
Sorry for eavesdropping,

06:16.099 --> 06:18.274
but that quotes from The Two
Towers, not the Silmarillion.

06:18.308 --> 06:21.691
Ooh, strange boy come to
mansplain Tolkien to Micki?

06:21.726 --> 06:23.383
And I have a front row seat!

06:23.417 --> 06:24.936
Kate!

06:24.970 --> 06:27.973
She knows everything there
is to know about the Inkers.

06:28.008 --> 06:29.354
Inklings.

06:29.389 --> 06:30.907
Lewis, Tolkien and Williams.

06:30.942 --> 06:32.909
And Barfield, Dyson,
Harvard and Lewis.

06:32.944 --> 06:34.463
Yeah, she already said Lewis.

06:34.497 --> 06:35.705
Likely referring to CS.

06:35.740 --> 06:37.258
I'm including his
brother Warren.

06:37.293 --> 06:38.708
Well, don't forget
Dorothy Sayers.

06:38.743 --> 06:40.158
Sayers was not
an official member.

06:40.192 --> 06:41.918
Only because she was a woman.

06:41.953 --> 06:42.885
I'll give you that.

06:42.919 --> 06:44.749
Ooh, he'll give you that.

06:44.783 --> 06:46.785
Hey, follow through and
give her your number.

06:46.820 --> 06:48.304
Kate?

06:48.338 --> 06:49.754
I'm Noah.

06:49.788 --> 06:51.065
She's Micki Sayers.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.584
No relation to Dorothy.

06:52.619 --> 06:53.792
Too bad.

06:53.827 --> 06:55.518
You might have been
eligible for the Inkers.

07:06.771 --> 07:08.117
Can I help you?

07:08.151 --> 07:10.188
Morrison, 325.

07:10.222 --> 07:12.397
The numbers don't seem
to go in order here.

07:12.432 --> 07:14.572
I think the idea is
to train the students

07:14.606 --> 07:17.437
to follow their instincts
and not trust their minds.

07:17.471 --> 07:19.093
Interesting
academic technique.

07:19.128 --> 07:21.613
Making foolishness out
of the world's wisdom.

07:21.648 --> 07:24.167
At least that's what we
tell ourselves when we goof.

07:24.202 --> 07:27.688
325 is on the second floor.

07:27.723 --> 07:30.967
300's are on the second
floor, below the 200s?

07:31.002 --> 07:34.074
Something about the
first shall be last, maybe.

07:35.109 --> 07:36.697
Keeping the 300s humble.

07:37.595 --> 07:40.183
I can show you, if you like.

07:40.218 --> 07:41.806
- No, thanks, I got it.
- Okay.

07:45.188 --> 07:46.742
One crazy thing, right?

07:46.776 --> 07:48.088
Hold up.

07:48.122 --> 07:50.228
I would love an escort.

07:54.404 --> 07:55.820
That may be heretical.

07:55.854 --> 07:58.305
Good thing my dental
insurance covers orthodoxy.

07:58.339 --> 07:59.651
Oh, oh, oh, oh!

07:59.686 --> 08:00.859
No, no, no, no, no.

08:00.894 --> 08:02.447
You do not get to
make a joke that bad.

08:02.482 --> 08:04.207
Oh, girls just wanna
have pun.

08:04.242 --> 08:06.209
Oh, I have been warned.

08:07.625 --> 08:10.351
So do you work here, as well?

08:10.386 --> 08:11.974
No, I'm...

08:12.008 --> 08:13.631
No.

08:13.665 --> 08:15.149
It's too bad.

08:15.184 --> 08:17.704
I was kind of hoping to see
you around campus a bit more.

08:17.738 --> 08:19.360
Oh, no, I'll be, I mean,

08:20.500 --> 08:23.399
I don't technically
work for the university,

08:23.433 --> 08:24.883
a gun for hire.

08:24.918 --> 08:26.022
I'm a consultant.
Really?

08:26.057 --> 08:28.369
Hmm hmm, evaluator.

08:28.404 --> 08:32.097
I evaluate classes,
professors for the school,

08:32.132 --> 08:35.722
I evaluate things and give
my evaluations to the school.

08:35.756 --> 08:37.068
I see.

08:37.102 --> 08:38.759
- Hmm.
- Well this is awkward.

08:39.898 --> 08:41.106
Oh, sorry.

08:41.141 --> 08:42.452
You're a professor.

08:42.487 --> 08:43.592
Of course.

08:43.626 --> 08:45.110
Not just a professor.

08:45.145 --> 08:48.320
Apparently, the one you're
going to be evaluating.

08:48.355 --> 08:49.425
It's my class.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.910
This will be fun.

08:53.498 --> 08:54.844
Won't it though?

08:56.743 --> 08:57.571
Eh.

08:58.952 --> 09:01.575
No way, why did you lie?

09:01.610 --> 09:04.198
My demon spawn told me to.

09:04.233 --> 09:06.235
I told you
to do something crazy,

09:06.269 --> 09:07.547
not crazy stupid.

09:08.720 --> 09:11.378
So how cute is he?

09:12.241 --> 09:13.173
- Kate!
- What?

09:13.207 --> 09:14.657
We were all thinking it.

09:16.107 --> 09:18.316
What did he say when he
found out you were a student?

09:18.350 --> 09:19.766
He didn't.

09:19.800 --> 09:21.664
When he called "Toni
Sayers" taking attendance,

09:21.699 --> 09:23.390
I just kept my mouth shut.

09:24.564 --> 09:26.945
Uh, so what does he
think your name is?

09:26.980 --> 09:27.774
Betty White.

09:28.982 --> 09:30.224
What?

09:30.259 --> 09:32.192
It was the first thing
to pop into my head.

09:32.226 --> 09:35.195
I told him my parents
were Golden Girls fans.

09:35.229 --> 09:37.784
Mom, we need to give
you lying lessons.

09:37.818 --> 09:38.923
Not that I've ever lied.

09:38.957 --> 09:40.407
Says, Juliet.

09:40.441 --> 09:42.443
Speaking of romance.
It's not a romance.

09:42.478 --> 09:43.893
Micki met a boy.

09:43.928 --> 09:45.412
Wait, you met a boy?

09:45.446 --> 09:47.034
And now it's time
to hit the books.

09:47.069 --> 09:48.967
Never too early to
get a running start.

09:58.943 --> 10:00.151
I'm writing a
letter to the editor,

10:00.185 --> 10:02.498
or at least a strongly
emoji'ed text.

10:02.532 --> 10:04.051
What's got your
hair in a knot?

10:04.086 --> 10:06.398
Did you see the
romance column today?

10:06.433 --> 10:08.400
There isn't a
romance column today.

10:08.435 --> 10:09.505
Back page.

10:16.305 --> 10:18.721
Why should we leap over
walls put up by women

10:18.756 --> 10:21.034
as a test of romantic ideals?

10:21.068 --> 10:22.967
Men, can you think
of a single woman

10:23.001 --> 10:24.865
worth playing these
kinds of games for?

10:24.900 --> 10:27.316
Here's an idea, Juliet.

10:27.350 --> 10:29.421
Tear down this wall.

10:29.456 --> 10:31.941
Ah!

10:32.804 --> 10:34.357
Good response, Addie.

10:34.392 --> 10:36.739
15 is exactly correct.

10:36.774 --> 10:39.224
Note that when
responding to a child,

10:39.259 --> 10:42.987
you repeat the correct
answer in your response.

10:43.021 --> 10:45.645
Shall we try another mock trial?

10:45.679 --> 10:48.682
Kate?

10:48.717 --> 10:51.512
If you have $5 and
you ask your father

10:51.547 --> 10:53.204
for five more dollars,

10:53.238 --> 10:54.861
how many dollars do you have?

10:54.895 --> 10:55.655
$5.

10:57.139 --> 10:59.728
I'm sorry, you don't seem
to understand your math.

10:59.762 --> 11:02.834
You don't seem to
understand my father.

11:14.190 --> 11:15.122
It's a gif.

11:15.157 --> 11:16.641
Of a cat jumping off a bed.

11:16.676 --> 11:19.920
Badly, Kate, trying
to say hang in there.

11:19.955 --> 11:21.542
You shouldn't take
this personally.

11:21.577 --> 11:23.303
But I love taking
things personally.

11:23.337 --> 11:26.996
Besides, his column
is a point-on-point
attack against mine.

11:27.031 --> 11:28.757
Healthy debate in
print is a good thing.

11:28.791 --> 11:31.207
It's one of the positives
of the news media.

11:31.242 --> 11:34.210
I'll just trash his
sanctimonious butt
in my next column.

11:34.245 --> 11:36.005
And that's one
of the negatives.

11:36.040 --> 11:37.558
Just focus on being you.

11:37.593 --> 11:39.422
I'll try.

11:39.457 --> 11:40.976
Oh, another piece of news,

11:41.010 --> 11:44.634
there are two finalists
for the Pealy scholarship.

11:44.669 --> 11:45.532
I knew that.

11:45.566 --> 11:46.533
Who's the other one?

11:49.432 --> 11:51.365
You have got to be kidding me.

11:51.400 --> 11:52.988
Who is this guy?

11:53.022 --> 11:54.506
You're gonna find
out soon enough.

11:54.541 --> 11:57.371
The Pealy committee has
asked me to arrange a debate

11:57.406 --> 11:59.028
between the two of you.

11:59.063 --> 12:00.961
Debate? On what?

12:00.996 --> 12:02.963
Focus of your columns.

12:02.998 --> 12:04.758
Romance.

12:04.793 --> 12:07.002
You get to express your
ideas out in public.

12:07.036 --> 12:09.659
It's sort of a tiebreaker
for the scholarship.

12:09.694 --> 12:10.488
When?

12:10.522 --> 12:12.317
Last week of October.

12:12.352 --> 12:14.112
I've set up a way for you two

12:14.147 --> 12:16.528
to come out from
behind your bylines,

12:16.563 --> 12:20.636
so-to-speak, and to discuss
and agree on the debate rules.

12:20.670 --> 12:22.327
Knives or guns?

12:24.744 --> 12:25.986
Dog.

12:26.021 --> 12:30.266
Also trying to hang in there.

12:30.301 --> 12:32.752
- Professor Lutton?
- Ah, Rose.

12:32.786 --> 12:35.651
A flower by any other name
would smell just as sweet.

12:35.685 --> 12:38.412
- Rose?
- From the Golden Girls.

12:38.447 --> 12:39.966
Betty White's character?

12:40.000 --> 12:41.208
Ye...

12:41.243 --> 12:43.486
The actress you
were named for.

12:43.521 --> 12:45.626
Oh, right, Betty White.

12:45.661 --> 12:46.558
That's me.

12:46.593 --> 12:47.870
What brings you to my office?

12:47.905 --> 12:51.805
Well, I had a question
on the text from class.

12:51.840 --> 12:53.186
Niebuhr is quoted as saying-

12:53.220 --> 12:54.463
Just outta curiosity,

12:54.497 --> 12:56.465
how many of these
course observations

12:56.499 --> 12:58.122
are you going to be doing?

12:58.156 --> 12:59.226
It's been two weeks.

12:59.261 --> 13:00.676
All semester.

13:00.710 --> 13:02.229
My company's very thorough.

13:02.264 --> 13:03.921
I guess so.

13:03.955 --> 13:06.613
Sorry to interrupt, Oscar,
meeting's been moved to four.

13:06.647 --> 13:07.994
- Thanks.
- Hey!

13:09.374 --> 13:11.445
Sorry, I don't think we've met.

13:11.480 --> 13:13.793
Jim Marcus, ancient languages.

13:13.827 --> 13:15.587
- I'm-
- Catherine Hepburn.

13:15.622 --> 13:17.244
She's on our Title IX team.

13:17.279 --> 13:19.729
We're just going over some
stats for the meeting.

13:21.628 --> 13:23.319
I've spotted the loons.

13:25.218 --> 13:26.391
Jim's a great guy,

13:26.426 --> 13:29.049
but he really hates
class evaluators

13:29.084 --> 13:31.431
and I wanted him to like you.

13:33.709 --> 13:34.606
Okay.

13:36.056 --> 13:38.334
Good slam, but
make it less direct.

13:38.369 --> 13:41.993
One might say romance is dead
if one's heart were dead.

13:42.028 --> 13:43.823
Ooh, yeah, that's better.

13:45.859 --> 13:49.069
When winter comes,

13:49.104 --> 13:52.555
the winter wild that
hill and wood shall slay.

13:52.590 --> 13:54.109
When trees shall fall

13:54.143 --> 13:57.491
and starless night
devour the sunless day.

13:57.526 --> 13:59.735
When wind is in the deadly east,

13:59.769 --> 14:01.012
then in the bitter rain,

14:01.047 --> 14:03.463
I'll look for the
and call to thee.

14:03.497 --> 14:05.706
I'll come to thee again.

14:05.741 --> 14:07.294
Call 911.

14:07.329 --> 14:09.089
I think he's having a stroke.

14:09.124 --> 14:10.608
It's not a stroke.

14:10.642 --> 14:12.575
It's the song of the Ents
from Lord of the Rings.

14:12.610 --> 14:13.956
Call 911.

14:13.991 --> 14:15.855
I think he's having
a nerd stroke.

14:17.063 --> 14:19.928
When winter comes
and singing ends,

14:19.962 --> 14:22.068
when darkness falls at last,

14:22.102 --> 14:23.724
when broken is the bear and bow

14:23.759 --> 14:26.279
and light and labor passed,

14:26.313 --> 14:28.419
I'll look for thee
and wait for thee

14:28.453 --> 14:30.317
until we meet again.

14:30.352 --> 14:33.873
Together we will take the
road beneath the bitter rain.

14:33.907 --> 14:36.254
Maybe I'm the one
having a stroke.

14:36.289 --> 14:37.946
Tuesday night, 7:00 PM?

14:37.980 --> 14:39.533
I'll
check my calendar.

14:45.470 --> 14:47.921
Wasn't that the cutest
little nerd thing?

14:47.956 --> 14:49.509
You're just jealous.

14:49.543 --> 14:51.373
What's Evlish for "not?"

14:57.897 --> 14:59.968
- Monkey's butt.
- Rebuttal?

15:00.002 --> 15:02.039
Yep, rebuttal
is three minutes.

15:02.073 --> 15:04.662
I guess that makes sense
in a sick sort of way.

15:04.696 --> 15:06.526
Is that a giraffe?

15:06.560 --> 15:09.080
- Duh.
- Playing golf.

15:09.115 --> 15:09.909
No, giraffe.

15:09.943 --> 15:10.737
How long is his neck?

15:10.771 --> 15:12.014
How long do we speak?

15:12.049 --> 15:13.878
And golf, because golfers say?

15:13.913 --> 15:15.362
- Fore.
- Fore!

15:15.397 --> 15:18.365
Four minutes, you couldn't
have made a list like a person?

15:18.400 --> 15:21.368
Ew, that sounds so normal.

15:21.403 --> 15:23.094
Is that an elephant?

15:23.129 --> 15:24.716
Huh, no, that
one's just for fun.

15:24.751 --> 15:26.546
I want Romeo to like
teeter on the edge of bit,

15:26.580 --> 15:28.099
trying to guess what
the heck it means.

15:29.756 --> 15:31.068
And he's late.

15:32.103 --> 15:33.277
Noah.

15:33.311 --> 15:34.140
Hi.

15:37.867 --> 15:39.593
Micki. Kate.

15:39.628 --> 15:42.010
Doctor. Doctor. Doctor.

15:42.044 --> 15:43.908
Sorry, I haven't
responded yet, it's just-

15:43.943 --> 15:45.737
No, don't worry.

15:45.772 --> 15:47.187
Busy, I know.

15:47.222 --> 15:50.363
Both right? So maybe later.

15:50.397 --> 15:52.882
Yeah. Yeah, I'll text you.

15:52.917 --> 15:53.711
Text you back.

15:53.745 --> 15:54.781
Right, right.

15:54.815 --> 15:56.334
So uh.

15:56.369 --> 15:57.439
Go, gotta go.

15:57.473 --> 15:59.372
Yeah, you gotta go.

15:59.406 --> 16:01.443
You cannot toy with that boy.

16:01.477 --> 16:03.134
He has got it bad.

16:04.653 --> 16:07.483
- Still, work before pleasure.
- Hmm.

16:07.518 --> 16:10.348
Let's give this Not
Your Romeo, his poison first.

16:10.383 --> 16:11.660
You gotta make
time for love, babe.

16:11.694 --> 16:12.523
You know where I learned that?

16:12.557 --> 16:14.042
- Hmm?
- Your column.

16:14.076 --> 16:15.767
Oh, you've read my column?

16:15.802 --> 16:18.115
No, I'm waiting for the movie.

16:18.149 --> 16:20.289
Um, hello?

16:20.324 --> 16:21.359
About time.

16:21.394 --> 16:22.774
You're Romeo?

16:22.809 --> 16:24.811
No, I'm Hugo.

16:24.845 --> 16:27.987
I mean, do you write the
column, Not Your Romeo?

16:28.021 --> 16:29.505
Yeah, that's me.

16:29.540 --> 16:30.575
I write that.

16:30.610 --> 16:32.646
I'm the Not Your Romeo guy.

16:32.681 --> 16:35.442
Oh, you are in my
Elementary Ed class.

16:35.477 --> 16:37.272
Yeah, that's you, right?

16:37.306 --> 16:38.549
I'm Hugo.

16:38.583 --> 16:40.171
Yeah, I got that
the first time.

16:40.206 --> 16:41.793
I uh...

16:41.828 --> 16:43.485
I play lacrosse.

16:43.519 --> 16:45.073
No kidding.

16:45.107 --> 16:46.764
I always wondered how do you
get the stick up in the air

16:46.798 --> 16:48.869
when your knuckles are
dragging on the ground?

16:48.904 --> 16:51.562
Nevermind.

16:51.596 --> 16:54.910
Okay, Romeo, let's come to
an agreement on debate rules.

17:08.130 --> 17:09.545
The guy's a complete moron.

17:09.580 --> 17:11.064
I don't think he can string
enough words together

17:11.099 --> 17:13.860
to write his own name,
let alone a whole column.

17:13.894 --> 17:15.689
It's the quiet ones
you have to watch out for.

17:15.724 --> 17:16.828
Kate is right.

17:16.863 --> 17:17.864
Don't underestimate him.

17:17.898 --> 17:19.693
Still waters run deep.

17:19.728 --> 17:22.006
I'm gonna mop the floor
with those still waters.

17:22.041 --> 17:23.835
Is that really the
right attitude to have?

17:23.870 --> 17:24.871
Absolutely.

17:24.905 --> 17:26.562
He is another human being.

17:26.597 --> 17:30.601
Please, sorry, I'm stuck
on the image of Mick mopping,

17:30.635 --> 17:33.155
let alone cleaning anything.

17:33.190 --> 17:34.363
He's stealing my scholarship.

17:34.398 --> 17:36.572
It is not your scholarship.

17:36.607 --> 17:38.436
Can you mop our
dorm room with him?

17:38.471 --> 17:40.093
The floor is sticky.

17:40.128 --> 17:41.094
Remember our rule.

17:41.129 --> 17:42.199
If you're gonna be mom,

17:42.233 --> 17:43.786
you can't study with us.
Okay, okay.

17:43.821 --> 17:46.272
Unless being mom means
bringing homemade snacks.

17:47.514 --> 17:48.791
Oh, cookie score.

17:49.792 --> 17:51.277
Why such the bookworm?

17:51.311 --> 17:54.694
Stupid professor gave
me a B+ on my last paper.

17:54.728 --> 17:56.420
- So sorry.
- Sorry?

17:56.454 --> 17:57.938
What's wrong with a B+?

17:57.973 --> 17:59.837
It's not an A.

17:59.871 --> 18:00.941
Right. My bad.

18:13.506 --> 18:14.403
Professor Lutton?

18:14.438 --> 18:16.957
Ah, the intrepid examiner.

18:16.992 --> 18:18.235
You know you had me
worried back there.

18:18.269 --> 18:19.753
You take copious notes.

18:19.788 --> 18:21.548
The topic is fascinating.

18:21.583 --> 18:23.447
And the delivery?

18:23.481 --> 18:24.379
Noteworthy.

18:25.276 --> 18:26.829
What can I do for you today?

18:26.864 --> 18:28.831
Well, I, I, I ran into
one of the other students

18:28.866 --> 18:31.110
from our class, Toni Sayers?

18:31.144 --> 18:33.353
You need to tell
Toni to come to class.

18:33.388 --> 18:35.252
Participation is
part of her grade.

18:35.286 --> 18:36.529
I will pass that along.

18:36.563 --> 18:38.738
Anyway, she was saying
that you put a note

18:38.772 --> 18:41.154
on one of her essays to ask you

18:41.189 --> 18:43.018
about a poster for
an academic fair.

18:43.052 --> 18:44.261
- I said that?
- Hmm hmm.

18:44.295 --> 18:45.710
Hmm, must have
been a good essay.

18:45.745 --> 18:47.298
What grade did I give her?
An A.

18:47.333 --> 18:49.266
Not sure why it wasn't
an A+, to be honest.

18:49.300 --> 18:51.716
We don't give A+'s
at this institution.

18:51.751 --> 18:52.683
Oh, right, of course.

18:52.717 --> 18:54.512
So about the academic fair-

18:54.547 --> 18:56.031
Now, Betty, you know,

18:56.065 --> 18:58.206
I can't talk to you about
another student's work.

18:58.240 --> 18:59.414
- Oh.
- FERPA.

18:59.448 --> 19:00.242
Oh, right.

19:01.416 --> 19:03.245
Oh, Dr. Johnson, I'll
be out in a second.

19:03.280 --> 19:05.937
Oh, have you met Audrey Hepburn?

19:05.972 --> 19:07.732
She's on the Title IX team.

19:07.767 --> 19:09.355
Audrey Hepburn?

19:09.389 --> 19:11.667
Her parents were
big Sabrina fans.

19:11.702 --> 19:14.153
- Okay.
- Yeah, big Sabrina fans.

19:14.187 --> 19:16.431
Really into teenage witches.

19:16.465 --> 19:18.191
Teenage witches?

19:18.226 --> 19:21.884
Which is clearly a show that
Audrey Hepburn was not in.

19:23.403 --> 19:24.922
Okay.

19:24.956 --> 19:26.958
You told the other guy my
name was Catherine Hepburn.

19:26.993 --> 19:27.787
I did?

19:27.821 --> 19:28.995
Oh, sorry.

19:29.029 --> 19:30.652
I can't keep my
Hepburn's straight.

19:30.686 --> 19:33.344
Hey, it's not easy keeping
up a false identity.

19:35.174 --> 19:36.589
Tell me about it.

19:46.012 --> 19:47.255
Just relax
your shoulders.

19:47.289 --> 19:49.705
You don't sneak up
on a woman with a bow!

19:49.740 --> 19:52.156
Yeah, good advice.

19:52.191 --> 19:54.054
What are you doing here?

19:54.089 --> 19:56.747
I just, I wanted
to know something.

19:56.781 --> 19:58.438
You never seem to
wanna speak to me.

19:58.473 --> 19:59.715
Why?

19:59.750 --> 20:02.339
Are you kidding,
Not Your Romeo?

20:02.373 --> 20:03.892
What would we talk about?

20:03.926 --> 20:04.824
We can talk about stuff.

20:04.858 --> 20:06.274
What do you wanna talk about?

20:06.308 --> 20:08.103
I don't know.

20:08.137 --> 20:12.003
Art, poetry, beauty, things
you wouldn't understand.

20:12.038 --> 20:12.832
Beauty, huh?

20:14.005 --> 20:17.630
I get that I'm not
one for art or poetry,

20:17.664 --> 20:20.288
but that doesn't mean I don't
know anything about beauty.

20:20.322 --> 20:21.150
May I?

20:26.017 --> 20:29.642
For me, it's in nature.

20:31.126 --> 20:33.853
One morning, I was
out in the woods,

20:34.888 --> 20:36.338
the sun barely up,

20:37.857 --> 20:41.447
and there was like this
mist covering the ground.

20:43.242 --> 20:44.622
I sat at the base of a tree.

20:47.073 --> 20:50.663
Maybe an hour, I
don't know.

20:50.697 --> 20:52.112
I lose track of time out there.

20:57.980 --> 21:00.017
I feel him before I see him,

21:01.260 --> 21:02.157
this deer,

21:03.538 --> 21:04.366
buck,

21:05.747 --> 21:07.058
coming out of the trees.

21:08.646 --> 21:09.992
Antlers at full growth.

21:11.304 --> 21:16.275
Muscle thick, tall, majestic.

21:17.759 --> 21:18.829
It's just me and him.

21:20.589 --> 21:22.039
No other sounds.

21:24.455 --> 21:25.801
We make eye contact.

21:28.563 --> 21:30.392
It's like the hush
of God's presence.

21:32.083 --> 21:32.912
Peace.

21:34.603 --> 21:36.018
Electricity.

21:38.400 --> 21:39.574
Me knowing that deer.

21:41.369 --> 21:42.266
And him knowing me.

21:44.889 --> 21:46.166
A moment outta time.

21:48.721 --> 21:50.067
One shot.

21:50.101 --> 21:52.449
Straight to the heart.

21:54.174 --> 21:55.693
That?

21:55.728 --> 21:56.694
That is beauty.

21:58.455 --> 22:00.319
So don't take
this the wrong way,

22:00.353 --> 22:05.185
but you are a horrible,
horrible human being.

22:05.220 --> 22:08.396
Is there a
right way to take that?

22:08.430 --> 22:09.258
Here.

22:10.259 --> 22:11.640
Just relax your shoulders.

22:11.675 --> 22:12.710
You'll do just fine.

22:20.442 --> 22:22.651
I never grow
tired of that story.

22:22.686 --> 22:24.791
Have you ever seen
the original TV movie?

22:24.826 --> 22:25.896
No, I haven't.

22:25.930 --> 22:27.069
I've read the book though.

22:27.104 --> 22:28.174
"A Grief Observed."

22:28.208 --> 22:29.348
Yeah, that's right.

22:29.382 --> 22:30.314
That's right.

22:30.349 --> 22:31.557
I tried to reread it though.

22:31.591 --> 22:33.386
I can't get through
it without crying.

22:34.663 --> 22:36.320
I'm not sure I get it.

22:36.355 --> 22:38.115
I mean, intellectually sure.

22:38.149 --> 22:40.635
But from a life standpoint,

22:42.361 --> 22:45.225
I guess I'm too young
or haven't lost enough.

22:46.710 --> 22:48.608
I thought I could
describe a state.

22:48.643 --> 22:49.885
Make a map of sorrow.

22:51.404 --> 22:55.063
Sorrow, however, turns out not
to be a state but a process.

22:55.097 --> 22:56.651
Whoa.

22:56.685 --> 22:58.515
Sounds like you understand.

22:58.549 --> 23:00.309
Not understand,

23:00.344 --> 23:01.345
but I do get it.

23:04.141 --> 23:04.969
Who?

23:06.246 --> 23:07.075
My dad.

23:08.421 --> 23:10.319
I was nine.

23:10.354 --> 23:11.182
Sorry.

23:12.529 --> 23:13.771
How'd you deal?

23:14.945 --> 23:16.809
Not all that
different from Lewis,

23:16.843 --> 23:19.052
and dealing with the
death of his wife.

23:19.087 --> 23:21.020
I was angry for a long time.

23:22.124 --> 23:22.953
At?

23:24.886 --> 23:26.922
God, I guess.

23:26.957 --> 23:29.408
I mean, who else can
you blame for cancer?

23:29.442 --> 23:32.376
But like Lewis said,
it's a process.

23:33.239 --> 23:34.827
Do you miss him?

23:34.861 --> 23:36.484
Sorry, stupid question.

23:36.518 --> 23:38.313
No,
no, no, it's okay.

23:38.347 --> 23:39.866
I mean, of course, I do.

23:39.901 --> 23:41.212
He was perfect.

23:41.247 --> 23:42.731
Him and my mom,

23:42.766 --> 23:45.216
if only someday day I can
find half of what they had.

23:46.425 --> 23:48.772
I've never really
had my faith tested.

23:48.806 --> 23:50.221
Stable home.

23:50.256 --> 23:51.844
No desire to go all prodigal.

23:54.260 --> 23:56.504
Wonder how I'll do
when the testing comes?

23:56.538 --> 23:57.366
You'll do fine.

23:58.851 --> 24:00.922
Okay, let's talk
about something else.

24:00.956 --> 24:03.787
What, depression and grief
isn't romantic enough for you?

24:03.821 --> 24:06.203
Oh, I'll bring that
up in the debate.

24:06.237 --> 24:08.239
Let's not talk
about the debate.

24:08.274 --> 24:09.793
What do you wanna talk about?

24:10.725 --> 24:12.243
Nothing.

24:12.278 --> 24:13.106
Let's just walk.

24:14.073 --> 24:15.108
Yeah.

24:15.143 --> 24:16.524
Sounds perfect.

24:24.048 --> 24:25.153
I'm surprised to
see you awake at all.

24:25.187 --> 24:26.637
What time did you sneak in?

24:26.672 --> 24:28.156
Not that late.

24:28.190 --> 24:30.676
And do I want to know what
the two of you were doing?

24:30.710 --> 24:32.160
- Talking.
- Hmm.

24:32.194 --> 24:33.299
I would say, just talking.

24:33.333 --> 24:35.197
But man, we went deep.

24:35.232 --> 24:36.440
You've been seeing each other

24:36.475 --> 24:38.338
for about three
weeks every night.

24:38.373 --> 24:41.272
And all he's interested
in doing is talking?

24:41.307 --> 24:42.860
I'm not saying that.

24:42.895 --> 24:44.793
I will say he's been
the perfect gentleman.

24:44.828 --> 24:46.070
Mm.

24:46.105 --> 24:47.244
You should have taken
Lit & Culture with me.

24:47.278 --> 24:48.348
Why, is it good?

24:48.383 --> 24:50.109
She's making us read Electra.

24:50.143 --> 24:51.628
Oh, I love Electra.

24:51.662 --> 24:54.216
I know, hence me wanting
you there, to copy your notes.

24:54.251 --> 24:55.148
Electra rocks.

24:55.183 --> 24:56.391
She really knew what she wanted.

24:56.425 --> 24:57.634
She killed her mother.

24:57.668 --> 24:59.843
Well, we don't all
have mothers like yours.

24:59.877 --> 25:00.671
Excuse me.

25:01.914 --> 25:03.709
Well, if it isn't
the romance killer.

25:03.743 --> 25:05.504
Deer killer.

25:05.538 --> 25:06.781
I come unarmed.

25:06.815 --> 25:08.817
And what did you come for?

25:08.852 --> 25:10.094
A truce.

25:10.129 --> 25:12.303
I was hoping this debate
thing could, you know,

25:12.338 --> 25:13.477
not come between us all?

25:13.512 --> 25:14.823
There's a between us all?

25:14.858 --> 25:16.169
I didn't know that.

25:16.204 --> 25:17.999
Hugo, dear boy,

25:18.033 --> 25:19.483
you can't blast
me from the paper

25:19.518 --> 25:21.727
and expect it not to
reverberate to real life.

25:21.761 --> 25:23.142
The internet has
given too many people

25:23.176 --> 25:24.592
a sense of anonymity.

25:24.626 --> 25:26.386
Life is life, dude.

25:26.421 --> 25:28.388
- But uh.
- Spit it out.

25:28.423 --> 25:30.390
You publish your
column from a fake name.

25:30.425 --> 25:32.738
So anonymity?

25:32.772 --> 25:34.463
The boy makes his mark.

25:34.498 --> 25:36.707
Good point. Good point.

25:36.742 --> 25:38.744
Okay, then, let's go public.

25:41.160 --> 25:43.921
Attention please for an
important announcement.

25:43.956 --> 25:48.063
The mysterious
columnist, Juliet, is me.

25:48.098 --> 25:49.720
And Not Your Romeo is none other

25:49.755 --> 25:52.999
than our dear friend, Hugo.

25:53.034 --> 25:56.969
Next month we'll be debating
our points of view on romance.

25:57.003 --> 25:58.936
But for your viewing pleasure,

25:58.971 --> 26:01.076
we'll give you a
preview of it now.

26:01.111 --> 26:02.215
Hugo.
Yeah, go on.

26:02.250 --> 26:04.424
- What, no, I'm-
- Chicken?

26:04.459 --> 26:06.634
Afraid to be exposed for
the fraud that you are?

26:06.668 --> 26:08.221
Let's have at it.

26:08.256 --> 26:09.637
As you all know,

26:09.671 --> 26:12.191
Romeo has declared that romantic
love is a waste of time.

26:12.225 --> 26:13.917
I never, I mean in context-

26:13.951 --> 26:15.504
That's Shakespeare,
Austen, Shelly,

26:15.539 --> 26:17.265
and Keats are all hogwash.

26:17.299 --> 26:18.577
His opinion.

26:18.611 --> 26:20.993
Does science take his side?

26:21.027 --> 26:24.168
Is Romeo aware that simply
reading romance lowers stress,

26:24.203 --> 26:26.032
decreases the chance
of heart failure

26:26.067 --> 26:28.483
and increases brain function?

26:28.517 --> 26:30.519
I, I didn't know that.

26:30.554 --> 26:33.592
Hmm, so what do
you know, Romeo?

26:33.626 --> 26:35.421
Why are you so
afraid of romance?

26:35.455 --> 26:37.803
Because it's a confidence
boost for women?

26:37.837 --> 26:39.598
Are you afraid of
confident women?

26:41.047 --> 26:43.291
I can list the benefits
of romantic love all day.

26:43.325 --> 26:45.017
Can you give me one negative?

26:46.570 --> 26:47.364
I don't wanna do this.

26:47.398 --> 26:49.262
Just give it a shot.

26:49.297 --> 26:53.163
- Um, Plato.
- What about Plato?

26:53.197 --> 26:56.615
He thought that romantic
love was, well, horrific

26:56.649 --> 26:58.271
and what it made people do.

26:58.306 --> 27:00.377
So your argument is that
Plato doesn't like love?

27:00.411 --> 27:02.206
- Well no, he did.
- Did or didn't?

27:02.241 --> 27:03.207
Make up your mind.

27:04.381 --> 27:07.487
He did like love,
just not romantic love.

27:07.522 --> 27:10.939
For him, brotherly
love was more ideal.

27:10.974 --> 27:12.458
Hmm.

27:12.492 --> 27:14.529
Well it sounds like poor Plato
got friend zoned too much.

27:14.563 --> 27:16.082
He couldn't get a girlfriend.

27:16.117 --> 27:18.429
So he decided love without
romance was the real deal.

27:18.464 --> 27:19.258
What about you?

27:19.292 --> 27:20.569
Friend zoned too much?

27:20.604 --> 27:22.468
Is that why you're so
bitter towards women?

27:22.502 --> 27:24.194
Micki, come on.

27:24.228 --> 27:25.954
Now that we've
exposed Not Your Romeo,

27:25.989 --> 27:27.507
let's really expose him.

27:27.542 --> 27:29.268
Have a girlfriend, Hugo?

27:29.302 --> 27:30.856
Ever have a girlfriend?

27:30.890 --> 27:33.203
Ever talk to a girl? Hmm?

27:36.206 --> 27:38.173
Just as I thought.

27:38.208 --> 27:40.486
Repression is not a good
basis for an opinion!

27:42.212 --> 27:44.421
This debate is gonna be a whole
lot easier than I thought.

27:44.455 --> 27:46.250
I don't think you
had to be so personal.

27:46.285 --> 27:48.528
Oh, everything is
personal in love and war.

27:48.563 --> 27:49.909
Felt a bit more like war.

27:51.255 --> 27:52.947
Who are you looking at?

27:52.981 --> 27:54.880
Noah, he's gone.

27:56.502 --> 27:57.330
Oh, well.

28:05.131 --> 28:06.477
Prof, you said
you need to see me?

28:06.512 --> 28:08.100
Oh, Betty, glad
you could make it.

28:08.134 --> 28:09.653
Look who's come for a visit.

28:11.310 --> 28:12.967
- Yeah.
- Dr. Linda West.

28:13.001 --> 28:14.934
The Dr. Linda West,

28:14.969 --> 28:17.834
President of the ECEEA.

28:17.868 --> 28:19.111
The uh?

28:19.145 --> 28:22.424
East Coast Educational
Evaluators Association.

28:22.459 --> 28:24.564
Your accreditor.

28:24.599 --> 28:28.776
Right, the old ECAE...

28:28.810 --> 28:30.294
A.

28:30.329 --> 28:32.711
Dr. West, I don't think
we've ever officially met.

28:33.781 --> 28:35.679
I don't think we have.

28:35.714 --> 28:38.958
And there's a very
good reason for that.

28:38.993 --> 28:40.408
Yes, there is.

28:40.442 --> 28:44.412
I was just elected.

28:44.446 --> 28:47.070
I have not been able
to visit your chapter.

28:47.104 --> 28:48.174
I am so sorry.

28:48.209 --> 28:49.451
Oh right, sure.

28:49.486 --> 28:50.970
Of course, that is
why we haven't met.

28:51.005 --> 28:51.799
Hmm.

28:52.731 --> 28:54.905
What chapter are you from?

28:54.940 --> 28:57.908
Oh, you know the one
that covers this area?

28:57.943 --> 29:00.428
Bloom's Pedagogical Division

29:00.462 --> 29:05.019
or the Kentucky Accurate
Assessment Association?

29:05.053 --> 29:07.021
That first one,
the Blooms thing.

29:07.055 --> 29:08.643
Oh, good.

29:08.677 --> 29:11.611
We have so much to talk about.

29:11.646 --> 29:13.061
Oh, oh, yummy.

29:13.096 --> 29:15.581
All this insider talk
is making me feel lost.

29:15.615 --> 29:17.203
We do not wanna make
you feel left out.

29:17.238 --> 29:18.929
So why don't we talk
about something else?

29:18.964 --> 29:20.172
No, no, no, no.

29:20.206 --> 29:22.450
I enjoy seeing you
in your environment.

29:22.484 --> 29:25.073
Please, make
yourselves comfortable.

29:28.421 --> 29:29.664
She said if we needed
an ice cream break,

29:29.698 --> 29:31.183
she picked up something
from the store.

29:31.217 --> 29:32.115
How much did she get?

29:32.149 --> 29:33.668
Well, she says all of it.

29:33.702 --> 29:35.843
- What flavors did she get?
- What flavors did she get?

29:37.534 --> 29:39.570
Well, she says all of them.

29:39.605 --> 29:41.055
Must have been
a rough afternoon.

29:41.089 --> 29:42.781
Yeah, or something.

29:42.815 --> 29:45.093
Hey, girls aren't
allowed on this floor past-

29:45.128 --> 29:45.991
How dare you!

29:46.025 --> 29:47.475
That is so offensive.

29:47.509 --> 29:48.717
I'm not a girl.
I, I-

29:48.752 --> 29:49.718
- I'm a woman.
- I, I-

29:49.753 --> 29:51.306
Shame! Shame!

29:52.307 --> 29:54.413
Wha, I gotta go.

29:56.587 --> 29:57.381
He does have a point.

29:57.416 --> 29:58.451
It is after 11.

29:58.486 --> 29:59.694
Well, yeah, I know,

29:59.728 --> 30:01.523
but I wanna celebrate
our victory over Romeo.

30:01.558 --> 30:03.180
And I want Noah in
on the celebration.

30:03.215 --> 30:04.803
You just want Noah so you can-

30:04.837 --> 30:05.873
Oh no, no, no,
no, don't say it.

30:05.907 --> 30:07.460
Or no ice cream for you.

30:07.495 --> 30:08.979
Lips sealed.

30:09.014 --> 30:11.810
But I do think you went a
little overboard with Hugo.

30:11.844 --> 30:13.363
Yeah, I know.

30:13.397 --> 30:14.916
I kind of got caught in the
moment and went all stupid.

30:14.951 --> 30:16.504
But I'll apologize to
him next time I see him.

30:16.538 --> 30:19.024
But party first, apology second.

30:19.058 --> 30:20.542
Think your boy toy could
have met us someplace

30:20.577 --> 30:21.958
a little less disgusting?

30:21.992 --> 30:23.511
Well, he hasn't
answered any of my texts.

30:23.545 --> 30:25.478
So the mountain has come to him.

30:25.513 --> 30:26.307
Wait, wait, hold on.

30:26.341 --> 30:27.239
I think this is it.

30:28.240 --> 30:29.379
What are you doing here?

30:29.413 --> 30:30.173
Girls aren't allowed
on the floor.

30:30.207 --> 30:31.657
Not a girl, woman.

30:31.691 --> 30:33.762
Yeah, that covers
it, shame, whatever.

30:33.797 --> 30:35.385
We are here to celebrate.

30:35.419 --> 30:36.696
Celebrate what?

30:36.731 --> 30:38.181
My victory today.

30:38.215 --> 30:39.665
You mean when you
embarrassed that guy

30:39.699 --> 30:41.218
in front of the whole campus?

30:41.253 --> 30:42.495
Was that fun?

30:42.530 --> 30:43.807
- Fun?
- To hurt someone?

30:43.842 --> 30:45.636
He didn't ask to be
treated like that.

30:45.671 --> 30:47.155
I don't feel like having
this conversation.

30:47.190 --> 30:48.398
Please, go.

30:48.432 --> 30:49.502
No, I'm not going
until we talk this out.

30:49.537 --> 30:51.056
Hey, I have an idea.

30:51.090 --> 30:53.196
How about we talk this out
a little more out of sight?

30:53.230 --> 30:54.749
Don't go in there.

30:54.783 --> 30:56.268
Oh, don't tell me you
have a girl in your room?

30:56.302 --> 30:59.202
I just got done talking
about not girl woman thing.

30:59.236 --> 31:01.238
How are we supposed
to make progress whe-

31:01.273 --> 31:04.069
Uh, either he does
have a girl in his room

31:04.103 --> 31:06.899
or that pile of
clothes is possessed.

31:06.934 --> 31:08.625
Noah?

31:08.659 --> 31:10.213
That's not a girl.

31:10.247 --> 31:11.455
It's my roommate.

31:11.490 --> 31:13.492
Then why is he hiding?

31:13.526 --> 31:15.666
Crap, I wish it was a girl.

31:16.840 --> 31:19.774
Hugo, come out, come
out wherever you are.

31:20.913 --> 31:22.881
Your roommates with Romeo?

31:24.468 --> 31:26.643
Oh, I think it's a
little worse than that.

31:28.093 --> 31:30.095
You wanna know why Hugo
is so poor at the debate?

31:30.129 --> 31:31.268
He's not our guy.

31:32.338 --> 31:33.926
This is another Romeo column.

31:34.789 --> 31:36.756
Your handwriting.

31:36.791 --> 31:38.172
What gives?

31:38.206 --> 31:39.345
Tell her.

31:39.380 --> 31:40.588
She's a little
slow on the uptake.

31:42.417 --> 31:46.007
Hugo's not Not Your Romeo.

31:46.042 --> 31:47.077
He is.

31:48.665 --> 31:49.735
When I went to the
debate prep meeting,

31:49.769 --> 31:51.288
I saw it was you,

31:51.323 --> 31:52.669
that you were Juliet.

31:52.703 --> 31:56.328
I didn't want to
jeopardize, whatever.

31:56.362 --> 31:58.882
So I sent Hugo in
to pretend to be me.

32:00.194 --> 32:01.264
Well...

32:01.298 --> 32:03.507
Consider our
whatever jeopardized.

32:03.542 --> 32:04.439
That's a pretty good idea

32:04.474 --> 32:05.924
now that I've seen the real you.

32:05.958 --> 32:07.166
Seen the real me?

32:07.201 --> 32:08.719
I opened up to you
about my father.

32:08.754 --> 32:10.514
Things that nobody
else knows about.

32:10.549 --> 32:11.930
And the whole time
you were lying to me

32:11.964 --> 32:12.931
about who you were?

32:12.965 --> 32:14.242
I wasn't lying.

32:14.277 --> 32:15.795
Oh so what?

32:15.830 --> 32:17.728
Dating me was just a way to
get a leg up on the debate?

32:17.763 --> 32:18.591
You.

32:20.214 --> 32:23.182
I thought you were.

32:32.364 --> 32:33.986
Who?

32:34.021 --> 32:35.574
What was his name again?

32:35.608 --> 32:37.783
I can't remember.

33:41.191 --> 33:44.125
I've just never seen
you so well groomed

33:44.160 --> 33:46.541
Well, one should never
neglect personal hygiene.

33:46.576 --> 33:48.509
Cleanliness is
next to godliness.

33:48.543 --> 33:49.820
Right.

33:49.855 --> 33:51.098
Roommate for three years,

33:51.132 --> 33:53.652
and not once did I
see you make your bed.

33:53.686 --> 33:55.654
I don't know what
you're talking about.

33:55.688 --> 33:58.277
Has she been dressing
like this every day?

33:58.312 --> 34:00.141
Hmm, every day.

34:00.176 --> 34:01.280
She did the laundry.

34:01.315 --> 34:02.178
Mopped the floors.

34:02.212 --> 34:04.283
Scrubbed the toilets.

34:04.318 --> 34:05.388
I'm really frightened.

34:05.422 --> 34:06.941
Okay, um, yeah.

34:06.975 --> 34:09.564
And these are?

34:09.599 --> 34:11.049
Potential plans
for the future.

34:11.083 --> 34:12.740
Organized by cost,

34:12.774 --> 34:15.260
time for delivery
and feasibility in
the current climate.

34:15.294 --> 34:19.022
Hack into his financial aid
and double his student loans?

34:19.057 --> 34:22.198
Hire an assassin
on the dark web?

34:22.232 --> 34:24.303
Develop an immunity
to iocaine powder

34:24.338 --> 34:26.995
and challenge him
to a battle of wits?

34:27.030 --> 34:29.377
Yeah, I should put
that one over here.

34:29.412 --> 34:30.620
It's gonna take too much time.

34:30.654 --> 34:32.346
Wow, you are really hurting.

34:32.380 --> 34:35.142
This level of
organization is well like,

34:35.176 --> 34:36.315
your mother.
I know.

34:37.592 --> 34:38.766
My rock bottom.
Hey!

34:39.732 --> 34:41.182
No offense.

34:42.149 --> 34:44.151
It's just he hurt me.

34:44.185 --> 34:46.187
Is it wrong to fantasize
about hurting him back?

34:46.222 --> 34:48.051
As long as it stays
in the world of fantasy.

34:48.086 --> 34:49.880
Well, the real world
solutions on the right.

34:49.915 --> 34:51.054
Fantasy on the left.

34:51.089 --> 34:52.366
When are you coming
back to campus?

34:52.400 --> 34:53.332
I'm not.

34:53.367 --> 34:54.609
I've got a new career goal.

34:54.644 --> 34:56.094
What? Destroy Noah?

34:56.128 --> 34:58.061
Well, people have had
fulfilling lives at less.

34:58.096 --> 34:59.580
What happened to
the carefree girl

34:59.614 --> 35:01.547
that danced across campus?

35:01.582 --> 35:04.309
I guess she found out people
were watching after all.

35:05.965 --> 35:08.071
So the men win again?

35:08.106 --> 35:09.279
What you talking
about, Willis?

35:09.314 --> 35:10.660
Noah is on campus
living his life

35:10.694 --> 35:11.454
like nothing ever happened.

35:11.488 --> 35:12.696
He won.

35:12.731 --> 35:14.215
He destroyed you.
He did not.

35:14.250 --> 35:18.081
But it's okay because you
as a weak, feeble female,

35:18.116 --> 35:20.118
it was inevitable
to end this way.

35:20.152 --> 35:21.257
You can't goad me.

35:24.398 --> 35:25.606
Okay, what should I do?

35:25.640 --> 35:27.090
Okay, go back to your life.

35:27.953 --> 35:29.713
Good point.

35:29.748 --> 35:32.095
Besides, then I can
gear up for the debate

35:32.130 --> 35:34.546
and humiliate him publicly.

35:34.580 --> 35:36.099
Good plan, Kate.

35:50.734 --> 35:52.046
Fancy meeting you here.

35:53.530 --> 35:54.738
You sent me a note saying,

35:54.773 --> 35:56.188
will you meet me at
the archery range?

35:56.223 --> 35:57.914
Yeah, that was me.

35:57.948 --> 36:00.365
Which you threw at
me as a paper airplane

36:00.399 --> 36:02.056
during a lecture like
an eight-year-old.

36:02.090 --> 36:04.162
That is a bit of
an exaggeration.

36:05.093 --> 36:06.164
Will you meet me?

36:06.198 --> 36:07.544
Check box, yes or no?

36:07.579 --> 36:08.925
You even wrote it in crayon.

36:08.959 --> 36:10.340
Well, it's Elementary Ed

36:10.375 --> 36:12.860
and I turn into a third
grader in Elementary Ed.

36:12.894 --> 36:14.620
What do you want?

36:14.655 --> 36:17.002
- Micki's miserable.
- Good!

36:17.036 --> 36:19.660
She's miserable because
she really, really likes Noah

36:19.694 --> 36:21.040
and she has a hard
time hating someone

36:21.075 --> 36:22.594
that she really, really likes.

36:22.628 --> 36:23.767
Double good.

36:23.802 --> 36:25.493
Right. So how's Noah?

36:27.633 --> 36:28.634
That's what I thought.

36:28.669 --> 36:30.188
They're supposed to be together.

36:30.222 --> 36:31.810
When they're apart,
they're miserable.

36:31.844 --> 36:34.606
And as long as they are
miserable, I'm miserable.

36:35.779 --> 36:37.540
So what do you
supposed to do about it?

36:37.574 --> 36:39.783
Easy.

36:39.818 --> 36:41.682
We bring them together.

36:52.140 --> 36:52.969
Shh!

36:56.731 --> 36:58.630
Whatever happens
though, don't leave me.

36:58.664 --> 37:00.425
I'm not gonna leave
you with some creepy guy

37:00.459 --> 37:01.840
as your study partner.

37:01.874 --> 37:03.151
Right and to be clear,

37:03.186 --> 37:04.808
he was assigned to
me for the project.

37:04.843 --> 37:05.844
Not my choice.

37:05.878 --> 37:07.086
Yeah, I got you.

37:07.121 --> 37:08.743
Okay and sorry in advance.

37:08.778 --> 37:10.469
Sorry? For?

37:12.816 --> 37:14.370
What do you want?

37:14.404 --> 37:17.787
I believe you've met Hugo
from my Elementary Ed class.

37:17.821 --> 37:20.755
He's the creepy guy I
have to do the project with?

37:20.790 --> 37:22.585
I'm the creepy guy.

37:22.619 --> 37:24.621
And why is
loiter-sack with him?

37:24.656 --> 37:26.761
Because I don't wanna
be alone with you two.

37:26.796 --> 37:28.660
I see why you didn't tell
me who you were meeting.

37:28.694 --> 37:29.661
I'm out.

37:29.695 --> 37:32.353
Dude, I'm invoking bro code.

37:32.388 --> 37:33.630
- Well, I'm out.
- No, no, no.

37:33.665 --> 37:36.357
I have to stay and when
a girl needs a friend...

37:36.392 --> 37:37.496
- Okay.
- Hey.

37:45.539 --> 37:46.919
I feel sad for you.

37:46.954 --> 37:48.887
No sense of romance.

37:48.921 --> 37:50.406
Did you know that
for most of history,

37:50.440 --> 37:52.856
society thought of love
as a horrible sickness?

37:52.891 --> 37:54.133
Really?

37:54.168 --> 37:54.927
A disease that makes
someone want to live

37:54.962 --> 37:55.687
for another person?

37:55.721 --> 37:56.998
Sounds awful.

37:57.033 --> 37:58.586
It drives people to
make stupid decisions.

37:58.621 --> 37:59.656
It drives people to do more

37:59.691 --> 38:00.933
than ever thought they could.

38:00.968 --> 38:02.694
- Take Romeo and Juliet-
- That's not a romance!

38:02.728 --> 38:03.695
It's a tragedy.

38:03.729 --> 38:04.937
Their love was cut short.

38:04.972 --> 38:06.214
Because they made
stupid decisions.

38:06.249 --> 38:07.146
Juliet should have
married the man

38:07.181 --> 38:08.665
her father picked for her.

38:08.700 --> 38:10.771
Oh, and live in a tragedy
rather than die in a tragedy?

38:10.805 --> 38:12.082
Is that what you think?

38:12.117 --> 38:13.429
We should go back to
arranged marriages?

38:13.463 --> 38:14.395
There are our worse things.

38:14.430 --> 38:15.879
- Uh, guys.
- Oh, wow.

38:15.914 --> 38:17.398
Too bad we didn't stay together.

38:17.433 --> 38:19.538
I bet my dad could've gotten
two cows and a chicken for me.

38:19.573 --> 38:20.746
- Don't oversell yourself.
- Noah.

38:20.781 --> 38:22.403
And don't undervalue
freedom for women

38:22.438 --> 38:23.611
to choose their mate.

38:23.646 --> 38:24.578
There are still
plenty of countries

38:24.612 --> 38:26.062
that sell women like cattle.

38:26.096 --> 38:28.064
- I'm not saying that!
- Then what are you saying?

38:28.098 --> 38:29.652
What I've been
saying all along.

38:29.686 --> 38:32.137
Romance makes people
do stupid stuff.

38:32.171 --> 38:34.139
- Like you dating me?
- Like me dating you!

38:54.193 --> 38:55.471
They let you publish this?

38:55.505 --> 38:57.680
She practically
forced them to.

38:57.714 --> 39:02.029
"Why all men are nauseating,
a partial listing."

39:02.063 --> 39:03.962
It is two pages long.

39:03.996 --> 39:06.033
Yeah, that's why
I said partial list.

39:06.067 --> 39:09.070
She has united
the women and men.

39:09.105 --> 39:10.278
They both hate the paper.

39:10.313 --> 39:12.764
- Oh honey.
- I know, I know!

39:12.798 --> 39:14.352
I was just so mad.

39:14.386 --> 39:15.870
Don't make her angry.

39:15.905 --> 39:18.183
You wouldn't like her when
she writes when she's angry.

39:18.217 --> 39:19.184
Thanks a lot.

39:20.530 --> 39:22.946
Anyone up for
breakfast at Tiffany's?

39:22.981 --> 39:24.016
Oh, sorry, girls.

39:24.051 --> 39:25.259
But you are on your own tonight.

39:25.293 --> 39:27.330
I have been invited to
a university fundraiser.

39:27.365 --> 39:29.021
Oh, are we meeting teacher?

39:29.056 --> 39:31.955
No, I mean, he will be
there, but not like that.

39:31.990 --> 39:34.510
Does he still think
you're one of the Hepburns?

39:34.544 --> 39:38.341
Yes, he is having a hard
time keeping his lies straight.

39:38.376 --> 39:40.274
I'm having trouble keeping up.

39:40.308 --> 39:42.449
Mick, breakfast at Tiffany's?

39:42.483 --> 39:44.968
Can't, just thought of
more things to add the list.

39:45.003 --> 39:47.074
This column is a two-parter.

39:49.041 --> 39:50.560
Keep an eye on her.

40:09.717 --> 40:12.340
I'm sorry, where
am I supposed to park?

40:12.375 --> 40:14.170
Uh, you don't park, ma'am.

40:14.204 --> 40:15.033
I park.

40:17.242 --> 40:18.208
Oh, right.

40:18.243 --> 40:19.382
Of course.

41:01.044 --> 41:04.220
Audrey, Oscar was just
telling me about you.

41:05.255 --> 41:06.291
Right, I'm Audrey.

41:06.325 --> 41:07.534
Of course, I am.

41:07.568 --> 41:08.673
And you are?

41:08.707 --> 41:10.226
Oh, so sorry.

41:10.260 --> 41:14.851
Grace, Francis, president.

41:15.611 --> 41:17.405
Of the university.

41:17.440 --> 41:18.234
Oh, right. Sorry.

41:18.268 --> 41:19.373
Right, uh.

41:19.407 --> 41:20.547
So very nice to meet you.

41:20.581 --> 41:22.825
Pleasure is all mine.

41:22.859 --> 41:25.483
Oscar says you are considering

41:25.517 --> 41:28.831
a donation of a
significant size.

41:28.865 --> 41:30.108
Donation to?

41:31.592 --> 41:33.456
Oh, right, I am
at a fundraisers.

41:33.491 --> 41:35.838
You must tell me
more about your father.

41:35.872 --> 41:37.149
Hmm?

41:37.184 --> 41:39.531
Oscar says he was a
big Honeymooners fan.

41:39.566 --> 41:41.222
That's why they
named you Audrey.

41:41.257 --> 41:42.845
I'm sorry, I'm not tracking.

41:42.879 --> 41:44.812
Audrey Meadows.

41:44.847 --> 41:48.678
Your dad, the founder
of Meadows Meats.

41:48.713 --> 41:50.162
I'm sorry.

41:50.197 --> 41:52.820
You are Audrey Meadows?

41:55.789 --> 41:57.066
To the moon, Oscar.

41:57.100 --> 41:58.481
To the moon.

42:01.242 --> 42:02.865
Can't believe
I agreed to this.

42:02.899 --> 42:04.383
Your mother said get
you outta the house.

42:04.418 --> 42:05.868
This is out of the house.

42:05.902 --> 42:07.386
Besides, you've been looking
forward to the screening

42:07.421 --> 42:09.181
of you know, for ages.

42:09.216 --> 42:11.080
The Bakshi animated
Lord of the Rings?

42:11.114 --> 42:12.633
On the big screen?

42:12.668 --> 42:14.255
You're right, I'm excited.

42:14.290 --> 42:15.533
Here's our row.

42:16.706 --> 42:18.328
Noah and Hugo?

42:18.363 --> 42:19.571
You have got to be kidding me.

42:19.606 --> 42:21.193
I am so out of here.

42:21.228 --> 42:22.609
Whoa.

42:22.643 --> 42:23.817
This will not be in theaters
again in our lifetime.

42:23.851 --> 42:25.681
And we are gonna
sit someplace-

42:25.715 --> 42:28.856
No, because this place is
packed and these are our seats.

42:28.891 --> 42:30.686
So come on, don't let him win.

42:31.825 --> 42:34.482
Excuse us.

42:34.517 --> 42:36.036
Excuse me.

42:39.557 --> 42:40.627
You guys want some popcorn?

42:40.661 --> 42:41.559
- No.
- No!

42:41.593 --> 42:43.146
I'd love some, starving.

42:43.181 --> 42:44.665
Didn't have anything
for dinner except,

42:44.700 --> 42:47.081
you know, sarcasm and
rants against men.

42:47.116 --> 42:48.496
You had a double
decker burger.

42:48.531 --> 42:49.705
Rants make me hungry.

42:51.016 --> 42:51.914
I'll split it with ya.

42:53.605 --> 42:55.262
- Do you mind?
- Yes, I do.

42:55.296 --> 42:56.366
Switch seats with me.

42:56.401 --> 42:58.092
- What?
- Switch seats with me.

42:58.127 --> 43:00.060
So I can get as much of
that free popcorn as I want.

43:00.094 --> 43:01.475
I'm not switching
seats with you.

43:01.509 --> 43:03.304
- Hey, sit down.
- Yeah.

43:03.339 --> 43:05.824
Dude, you are getting
between me and free food.

43:05.859 --> 43:07.170
Switch!
Move it.

43:07.205 --> 43:08.447
Okay. Okay.

43:13.970 --> 43:15.489
Well played.

43:15.523 --> 43:18.216
Oh, yeah, no, I just
really like popcorn.

43:18.250 --> 43:20.011
You know, the armrest
is not solely for you.

43:20.045 --> 43:20.943
Not yours either.

43:20.977 --> 43:22.220
I paid just as much as you did.

43:22.254 --> 43:23.773
Come on.

43:23.808 --> 43:28.157
I've waited 10 years to see
this movie on the big screen.

43:28.191 --> 43:30.090
Great, got a
manspreader next to me.

43:30.124 --> 43:31.332
Oh, you want me to manspread?

43:31.367 --> 43:32.713
How's this?

43:32.748 --> 43:33.645
Typical.

43:33.680 --> 43:34.681
Of course, I'm typical.

43:34.715 --> 43:35.820
All men are the same to you.

43:35.854 --> 43:38.201
I mean it, shut up.

43:38.236 --> 43:40.548
Why don't I mansplain
what manspreading is to you?

43:40.583 --> 43:42.102
It's when a man-

43:42.136 --> 43:43.759
You know, I'm gonna take
some of that popcorn now.

43:43.793 --> 43:44.829
Whoa.

43:44.863 --> 43:46.589
- This means war.
- Hey!

43:52.733 --> 43:54.390
When you say banned for life,

43:54.424 --> 43:57.358
do you mean my
life or your life?

44:00.085 --> 44:00.879
Dang it.

44:01.811 --> 44:03.330
I really liked this theater.

44:12.615 --> 44:14.479
Plan C it is.

44:19.035 --> 44:19.967
And the yellow?

44:21.348 --> 44:23.419
People who think
I'm Audrey Hepburn.

44:23.453 --> 44:24.938
Well, the first layer is people

44:24.972 --> 44:26.146
who think I'm Audrey Hepburn.

44:26.180 --> 44:28.942
The second layer
are people connected

44:28.976 --> 44:32.808
to the first who think,
well, might think so.

44:32.842 --> 44:35.431
- This is a lot of lies.
- I know.

44:35.465 --> 44:36.708
Think I have enough yarn?

44:36.743 --> 44:38.676
Not nearly.

44:38.710 --> 44:42.369
Wait, 500,000 for
the Meadows Complex?

44:42.403 --> 44:45.027
We might be funding
a new athletic center.

44:45.061 --> 44:47.132
Reminds me, you weren't planning
on using both your kidneys,

44:47.167 --> 44:48.513
were you?

44:48.547 --> 44:50.446
Mom, this is too much.

44:50.480 --> 44:51.619
I know.

44:51.654 --> 44:53.000
You should be
ashamed of yourself.

44:53.035 --> 44:53.967
Me?

44:54.001 --> 44:55.278
I said do one crazy thing.

44:55.313 --> 44:56.245
One.

44:56.279 --> 44:57.936
It is like potato chips.

44:57.971 --> 44:59.766
You can't stop at one.

44:59.800 --> 45:02.561
Well, I'll donate
Kate's liver.

45:02.596 --> 45:04.253
Why, you still think
she's setting you up?

45:04.287 --> 45:05.772
Something's going on with her.

45:05.806 --> 45:08.153
Maybe she just
wants you happy.

45:08.188 --> 45:09.016
Maybe.

45:09.914 --> 45:11.191
Purple?

45:11.225 --> 45:13.538
People think my
name is Toni Sayers.

45:13.572 --> 45:15.264
I'm the only one
that connects to.

45:15.298 --> 45:17.438
Special bond of
mother and daughter.

45:24.687 --> 45:27.069
I adore when professor
Michael speaks.

45:27.103 --> 45:28.449
Don't be mean.

45:28.484 --> 45:30.141
He's diagnosed with narcolepsy.

45:30.175 --> 45:31.556
It's not his fault.

45:31.590 --> 45:33.213
Well, we get to sleep
through his talks.

45:33.247 --> 45:35.284
It's only fair that
he gets to, as well.

45:36.526 --> 45:37.700
Oh, hey, Hugo!

45:37.735 --> 45:39.633
Wait up!
Kate, what are you doing?

45:39.667 --> 45:40.841
Listen up.

45:40.876 --> 45:41.911
Because I'm only going
to admit this once

45:41.946 --> 45:43.395
and you are clueless.

45:43.430 --> 45:44.603
I like Hugo.

45:44.638 --> 45:46.433
Like, like him, okay?

45:46.467 --> 45:48.331
And I've been trying to
get his attention all week.

45:48.366 --> 45:50.126
And you've been blowing it.

45:50.161 --> 45:51.714
- Come on.
- No, no, no, serious face.

45:51.749 --> 45:53.267
Believe me.

45:53.302 --> 45:55.580
We are going to walk
across campus together.

45:55.614 --> 45:56.754
Oh, no.

45:56.788 --> 45:57.720
And you are not
going to cause a scene.

45:57.755 --> 45:58.514
I repeat not.
I'm not going-

45:58.548 --> 46:00.516
Going to cause a scene

46:00.550 --> 46:02.069
because you owe me this one.

46:02.104 --> 46:03.208
Hmm?

46:03.243 --> 46:04.071
- Fine.
- Fine.

46:09.283 --> 46:10.353
I think she bought it.

46:12.735 --> 46:13.771
Well, they're not fighting.

46:13.805 --> 46:15.462
So far so good.

46:15.496 --> 46:16.325
Yeah.

46:17.326 --> 46:18.120
You look cold.

46:18.154 --> 46:19.155
Here, take this.

46:19.190 --> 46:20.018
- No, thanks.
- No, no, no.

46:20.053 --> 46:20.847
I'm fine.

46:22.365 --> 46:25.127
It's the kind of thing a guy
would do for a lady he likes.

46:25.161 --> 46:26.611
Right. Right.

46:26.645 --> 46:27.474
Here.

46:29.441 --> 46:31.789
Crap, it might be real.

46:31.823 --> 46:33.514
I was afraid of that.

46:33.549 --> 46:35.171
We gotta sell this, right?

46:35.206 --> 46:36.034
Good point.

46:37.277 --> 46:40.245
Hugo doesn't fall
easy, but when he does.

46:40.280 --> 46:41.557
Neither does Kate.

46:41.591 --> 46:44.077
She has a general
disdain for romance.

46:44.111 --> 46:45.354
Hates my column.

46:45.388 --> 46:47.908
Which makes her a good
sounding board for it.

46:47.943 --> 46:50.083
If we really wanna sell it.

46:56.261 --> 46:57.642
Hugo loves your column.

46:57.676 --> 46:58.816
You're kidding?

46:58.850 --> 47:00.369
He's the reason I wrote mine.

47:00.403 --> 47:02.060
Came out of our arguments.

47:02.095 --> 47:03.959
Still haven't won him over.

47:03.993 --> 47:06.099
The dude's favorite
movie is The Notebook.

47:07.755 --> 47:09.723
Kate said he was a hunter.

47:09.757 --> 47:11.000
So?

47:11.035 --> 47:13.278
People have been hunting
since the dawn of time.

47:13.313 --> 47:14.970
You don't think people
with big hearts existed

47:15.004 --> 47:17.869
before vegetarianism
became a fad?

47:17.904 --> 47:19.871
I'm just saying it
doesn't fit the image.

47:19.906 --> 47:21.045
Stereotype much?

47:22.287 --> 47:23.668
I promised Kate
we wouldn't fight.

47:23.702 --> 47:25.877
How about we don't talk at all?

47:25.912 --> 47:27.189
It's a deal.

47:34.886 --> 47:36.439
Sure it won't hurt
your romance when I

47:36.474 --> 47:38.476
destroy Hugo's best
friend tonight?

47:38.510 --> 47:40.788
Ha, I was actually
hoping the two of you

47:40.823 --> 47:42.929
would end this whole
debate thing by now.

47:42.963 --> 47:44.689
Not in your life.

47:44.723 --> 47:47.623
In a few hours, I
get me some payback.

47:47.657 --> 47:49.176
Getting ready
for a sound check.

47:49.211 --> 47:51.696
Please speak in the volume
you plan on using tonight.

47:52.904 --> 47:55.079
Crushing defeat volume.

47:55.113 --> 47:55.907
Got it?

47:57.012 --> 47:58.530
Hold on, Mick.

47:59.393 --> 48:00.187
Something's up.

48:01.982 --> 48:04.329
- We have to cancel.
- What's going on?

48:04.364 --> 48:06.676
My folks? They um.

48:06.711 --> 48:08.437
His parents were
in a car accident.

48:08.471 --> 48:10.059
He's texting his
brother right now.

48:10.094 --> 48:11.474
Gosh, are they okay?

48:11.509 --> 48:13.649
We don't, they were
taken to the hospital.

48:13.683 --> 48:14.995
Greg's been trying to get me...

48:16.134 --> 48:17.032
We have to cancel.
Daddy?

48:20.759 --> 48:22.140
It's gonna be okay.

48:22.175 --> 48:23.072
It's gonna be okay.

48:24.867 --> 48:26.317
Daddy!

48:27.974 --> 48:29.320
- I have a car.
- Can I borrow it?

48:29.354 --> 48:30.252
You're in no condition.

48:30.286 --> 48:31.529
I'll drive.

48:31.563 --> 48:33.565
- It's four hours away.
- I said I'm driving.

48:33.600 --> 48:34.773
Get him packed.

48:34.808 --> 48:36.051
Make sure he has
things like a phone,

48:36.085 --> 48:37.707
a wallet, overnight stuff.
Got it.

48:39.261 --> 48:40.779
Tell Murrow,
I'll get mom's car.

48:40.814 --> 48:43.472
Okay, yeah, but we'll
first, we'll just...

49:16.815 --> 49:19.025
- Thanks.
- No problem.

49:20.095 --> 49:22.166
You sure you're gonna be okay?

49:24.651 --> 49:27.171
Yeah, my brother
will take me home.

49:29.000 --> 49:31.761
Well, text me with any updates

49:31.796 --> 49:35.213
and I'll see you back on campus.

49:39.907 --> 49:41.254
I don't...

49:41.288 --> 49:42.841
I mean...

49:42.876 --> 49:44.360
That's what friends are for.

50:55.362 --> 50:57.295
- They're out of the woods.
- Okay.

50:57.330 --> 50:59.228
His dad's home already.

50:59.263 --> 51:00.747
His mom comes home tomorrow.

51:00.781 --> 51:02.369
Oh, thank God.

51:02.404 --> 51:05.096
Noah's gonna stay
there for another week,

51:05.131 --> 51:06.028
help Greg out.

51:09.583 --> 51:13.070
Notice how we pray a lot
more when bad things happen?

51:15.037 --> 51:16.038
Lewis's megaphone.

51:17.557 --> 51:21.664
Except when I was angry
at Noah, I stopped praying.

51:21.699 --> 51:24.184
I didn't talk to God at all.

51:26.359 --> 51:27.739
Why do you think that is?

51:29.741 --> 51:31.191
Because I knew in my heart,

51:31.226 --> 51:33.573
that God would tell

52:04.362 --> 52:06.019
Tell me again how you met dad.

52:06.053 --> 52:07.503
Oh, boy.

52:07.538 --> 52:11.749
I was doing books for the
company he worked for.

52:11.783 --> 52:13.060
I had to go into the office

52:13.095 --> 52:15.891
because he was missing
receipts from a trip.

52:15.925 --> 52:17.410
Now, hold on.

52:17.444 --> 52:19.412
I thought you said you met
dad at an office party.

52:19.446 --> 52:21.138
No, the Christmas party

52:21.172 --> 52:24.279
was when I realized that I
was in love with your father.

52:24.313 --> 52:26.143
I met him in his office.

52:26.177 --> 52:28.835
I always thought this was
a love at first sight thing.

52:28.869 --> 52:31.217
Oh, heavens, no.

52:31.251 --> 52:33.633
Your dad was so
irritating when I met him.

52:33.667 --> 52:37.154
He could not hold onto a
receipt to save his life.

52:37.188 --> 52:38.638
How?

52:38.672 --> 52:41.537
How long did you know him
before you guys fell in love?

52:41.572 --> 52:43.988
It was about
six months for me.

52:44.022 --> 52:48.199
Well, he says it was love
from day one for him,

52:48.234 --> 52:49.131
which I doubt.

52:49.166 --> 52:51.789
I was his nemesis.

52:51.823 --> 52:54.895
Can't see you two
as nemeses, nemosis

52:54.930 --> 52:56.242
or whatever.

52:56.276 --> 52:58.485
Well I dogged him so bad.

52:58.520 --> 53:00.453
He claimed after the fact

53:00.487 --> 53:02.109
that he was sloppy
with the books

53:02.144 --> 53:05.527
just to get me to
see him all the time.

53:05.561 --> 53:07.045
But it wasn't true?

53:07.080 --> 53:08.702
Oh, he could not keep his
checking account straight

53:08.737 --> 53:10.290
after we were married, so no.

53:11.533 --> 53:13.914
Can't see you two as
opposites in anything.

53:13.949 --> 53:16.538
Product of a
selective memory, hun.

53:16.572 --> 53:17.470
Think about it.

53:17.504 --> 53:18.850
And I am sure you will remember

53:18.885 --> 53:21.301
all kinds of ways
that we did not align.

53:22.544 --> 53:23.821
I thought you
guys were in love.

53:23.855 --> 53:24.684
We were,

53:26.133 --> 53:28.584
just not the kind of love
you're thinking about.

53:28.619 --> 53:31.415
See, romance stories
are just misleading

53:31.449 --> 53:34.211
'cause they're all about
how two people get together.

53:35.350 --> 53:37.869
Okay, but isn't
that what romance is?

53:37.904 --> 53:40.182
I mean, Romeo sees
Juliet across the room

53:40.217 --> 53:42.115
and his heart is gone.

53:42.149 --> 53:44.704
Ah, until the next
week when he realizes

53:44.738 --> 53:48.363
Juliet farts, snores
and hogs the blankets.

53:48.397 --> 53:49.778
I didn't realize
you hated romance.

53:49.812 --> 53:51.642
I love romance.

53:51.676 --> 53:53.540
Just not that cotton candy kind.

53:54.990 --> 53:59.546
Real romance is two people
working on themselves,

54:00.685 --> 54:01.583
on their relationship
with each other,

54:01.617 --> 54:02.894
on their relationship with God.

54:02.929 --> 54:04.068
But love shouldn't be work.

54:04.102 --> 54:06.277
But love is work.

54:06.312 --> 54:07.796
A willingness to work.

54:08.797 --> 54:11.248
God loves us, yeah?
Duh.

54:11.282 --> 54:12.904
Easy for Him?

54:14.699 --> 54:16.287
Point taken.

54:16.322 --> 54:18.013
We certainly don't make it easy.

54:18.047 --> 54:18.910
Umm hmm.

54:20.118 --> 54:22.155
So have you hated my
column this whole time?

54:22.189 --> 54:24.157
Oh, I adore your column.

54:25.538 --> 54:28.230
Just thought it was naive.
Hmm.

54:29.404 --> 54:32.061
Almost as naive
as Noah's responses.

54:33.511 --> 54:36.100
Ah, which reminds me
I need to continue

54:36.134 --> 54:39.931
removing the detritus
of my own naivete.

54:39.966 --> 54:42.382
What you gonna do once
that wall is cleaned up?

54:43.556 --> 54:45.730
Make an appointment
with my professor.

54:45.765 --> 54:47.180
- Eh.
- Hmm hmm.

54:58.087 --> 54:58.916
Hey!

55:00.227 --> 55:01.298
Hey.

55:01.332 --> 55:03.645
So, you're back?

55:03.679 --> 55:06.441
Apparently, I have a big
debate to attend tomorrow.

55:06.475 --> 55:08.546
Oh, of course.

55:08.581 --> 55:09.961
Saw the video of your mom.

55:09.996 --> 55:11.377
She's moving around real good.

55:11.411 --> 55:13.033
Ready for the dance floor.

55:13.068 --> 55:14.828
Got your likes.

55:14.863 --> 55:16.623
Mom laughed at your comment.

55:16.658 --> 55:17.624
It was stupid.

55:19.108 --> 55:20.420
Good to see her laughing.

55:22.422 --> 55:24.907
So I've been...
Yeah.

55:26.046 --> 55:26.875
Yeah, me too.

55:27.910 --> 55:28.739
Listen.

55:29.774 --> 55:30.810
Thank you for everything.

55:30.844 --> 55:31.845
Oh, it's nothing.

55:31.880 --> 55:33.364
Anyone would-
No, listen.

55:35.090 --> 55:37.541
Thank you, for everything.

55:38.783 --> 55:41.821
You're welcome.

55:44.237 --> 55:48.724
So that stupid promise to
do one wild thing snowballed.

55:48.759 --> 55:50.588
I have no idea why I kept it up.

55:51.900 --> 55:53.902
Thank you for telling me.

55:53.936 --> 55:55.731
You don't seem too surprised.

55:55.766 --> 55:56.698
Oh, no.

55:56.732 --> 55:58.320
I knew who you were all along.

55:58.355 --> 55:59.839
That first day in the hall,

55:59.873 --> 56:02.497
you showed me your form with
the room number on it and-

56:02.531 --> 56:04.499
And my name was on the form.

56:04.533 --> 56:05.948
Your name was on the form.

56:05.983 --> 56:08.226
And you didn't say
anything because?

56:08.261 --> 56:09.745
Well, I was a little confused

56:09.780 --> 56:11.298
when you didn't
answer the roll call,

56:11.333 --> 56:13.508
but, uh, you were just so cute

56:13.542 --> 56:15.164
when you told me you
were Betty White.

56:15.199 --> 56:17.201
I'm so embarrassed.

56:17.235 --> 56:18.478
Wait, hold up.

56:18.513 --> 56:20.446
You told people I
was other people.

56:20.480 --> 56:22.137
Oh yeah, that was fun.

56:22.171 --> 56:23.069
Don't worry.

56:23.103 --> 56:24.622
They were all all in on it.

56:24.657 --> 56:26.486
Nobody thinks you're either
Katherine or Audrey Hepburn.

56:26.521 --> 56:28.212
Or Audrey Meadows.

56:28.246 --> 56:29.938
No, the president does
think you're the heir

56:29.972 --> 56:31.042
to the Meadows fortune.

56:31.077 --> 56:32.285
Oh, that's okay.

56:32.319 --> 56:33.873
My daughter doesn't
need her kidneys.

56:33.907 --> 56:35.115
One more confession.

56:36.289 --> 56:38.187
I haven't read any
of your essays.

56:38.222 --> 56:40.155
Oh, that cannot be
quality instruction.

56:40.189 --> 56:43.917
I sensed a
chemistry between us,

56:43.952 --> 56:45.160
wouldn't be right to grade you.

56:45.194 --> 56:48.577
So I had Dr. Marcus
grade all your essays.

56:48.612 --> 56:49.406
Nobel of you.

56:50.683 --> 56:52.961
He thinks you have potential.

56:52.995 --> 56:54.031
He has taste.

56:55.964 --> 56:58.518
Followed by two
minutes of rebuttal.

56:58.553 --> 57:00.451
And then we'll end with
five minutes summations.

57:00.486 --> 57:02.039
Good?

57:02.073 --> 57:02.902
All right.

57:02.936 --> 57:03.765
Micki?

57:04.973 --> 57:05.767
Call it.

57:05.801 --> 57:06.630
Heads.

57:08.183 --> 57:10.496
Heads it is, your choice.

57:10.530 --> 57:11.358
I go first.

57:12.843 --> 57:13.844
Have a good debate.

57:16.191 --> 57:17.468
Break a leg.

57:17.503 --> 57:18.331
You, too.

57:19.505 --> 57:21.265
Hey, before this
turns into whatever,

57:21.299 --> 57:22.956
you free Monday night?

57:22.991 --> 57:25.234
Wow, that's a
distraction tactic.

57:25.269 --> 57:26.753
No, not a date.

57:26.788 --> 57:28.997
Sorry, I found a copy of
Bakshi's Lord of the Rings

57:29.031 --> 57:30.930
and Gary, my friend
over in media,

57:30.964 --> 57:33.035
says the screening
room is open on Monday.

57:34.036 --> 57:35.106
Just for you, not me.

57:35.141 --> 57:36.349
Not a date.

57:36.383 --> 57:37.454
A chance for you to see
it on the big screen.

57:37.488 --> 57:40.215
'Cause I kind of
ruined the last-

57:41.665 --> 57:42.459
Nevermind.

57:42.493 --> 57:43.287
This was stupid.

57:43.321 --> 57:44.530
No, it's sweet.

57:45.427 --> 57:46.255
Thank you.

57:47.533 --> 57:48.706
Without further ado,

57:48.741 --> 57:50.915
Mikayla Sayers and Noah Haynes.

57:53.539 --> 57:54.678
Opening statements.

57:54.712 --> 57:55.782
Sayers will begin.

57:56.749 --> 57:58.129
Thank you, Dr. Murrow.

57:58.164 --> 58:00.373
And thank you all for attending.

58:00.407 --> 58:02.893
And thank you Noah for
helping me change my mind

58:02.927 --> 58:04.135
about what to do tonight.

58:05.343 --> 58:08.864
Before I begin, I never
apologized to Hugo.

58:08.899 --> 58:10.970
What I did that day in the
student center was mean

58:11.004 --> 58:12.765
and uncalled for.

58:12.799 --> 58:13.766
Please forgive me.

58:17.804 --> 58:20.911
Tonight, we are here
to debate romance.

58:22.119 --> 58:23.361
We each hope to
destroy the other

58:23.396 --> 58:25.571
through our verbal gymnastics.

58:25.605 --> 58:27.400
Two orators enter the ring,

58:27.434 --> 58:30.127
only one gets out alive.

58:30.161 --> 58:32.854
The entire idea of what
we're doing here tonight

58:32.888 --> 58:35.960
proves that we have no clue
what we're talking about.

58:35.995 --> 58:40.344
The very idea of
love is, is not this.

58:40.378 --> 58:43.554
Love is not about
crushing the other.

58:43.589 --> 58:44.935
It's not about bragging rights,

58:44.969 --> 58:47.178
who's right or even who's best.

58:47.213 --> 58:50.388
Tearing someone down,
demanding a surrender,

58:50.423 --> 58:52.114
that isn't love.

58:52.149 --> 58:54.082
It's not about winning.

58:54.116 --> 58:57.326
If there is winning and losing
in love, then it isn't love.

58:58.465 --> 59:02.055
So maybe we should stop
looking for romance

59:02.090 --> 59:03.574
and look for love instead.

59:04.748 --> 59:06.853
Because love is
about communication.

59:06.888 --> 59:09.442
It's about listening
more than talking.

59:09.476 --> 59:11.996
Love is about the other.

59:12.031 --> 59:14.551
Love is about
what's best for all.

59:14.585 --> 59:15.724
Love believes.

59:15.759 --> 59:16.863
Love hopes.

59:18.175 --> 59:20.798
So, here's my proposal.

59:20.833 --> 59:22.420
Let's skip the debate.

59:22.455 --> 59:25.078
Admit right now
that it's pointless.

59:25.113 --> 59:28.116
Instead, let's have
a conversation,

59:28.150 --> 59:30.705
starting with, I don't know,

59:30.739 --> 59:33.121
starting with,
here's what I hope,

59:33.155 --> 59:35.364
starting with,
what do you think?

59:36.814 --> 59:39.679
So, what do you think?

59:43.165 --> 59:44.546
Let's do it.

59:55.212 --> 59:56.696
Okay, scary time.

59:56.731 --> 59:57.594
Listening.

59:57.628 --> 59:59.423
You all talk to us.

59:59.457 --> 01:00:00.597
What is love?

01:00:02.564 --> 01:00:03.807
She's serious.

01:00:03.841 --> 01:00:05.325
Tell us what you're thinking.

01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:06.257
What is love?

01:00:08.363 --> 01:00:11.469
I mean, God, right?

01:00:11.504 --> 01:00:12.816
Safe answer.

01:00:12.850 --> 01:00:14.541
Let's go deeper.

01:00:14.576 --> 01:00:16.302
My grandfather.

01:00:16.336 --> 01:00:17.544
What about him?

01:00:17.579 --> 01:00:19.581
He left everything to
come to this country.

01:00:19.616 --> 01:00:22.480
I mean, everything, just to
give his family a better life.

01:00:22.515 --> 01:00:24.862
Sacrifice, yeah,
now, we're talking.

01:00:24.897 --> 01:00:26.692
And that ties into your
safe answer, right?

01:00:26.726 --> 01:00:28.245
Love sacrifices.

01:00:29.142 --> 01:00:30.350
What else have ya got?

01:00:30.385 --> 01:00:31.938
Where you going?

01:00:31.973 --> 01:00:32.767
They got this.

01:00:32.801 --> 01:00:34.216
Our work here is done.

01:00:34.251 --> 01:00:35.562
Oh, okay.

01:00:35.597 --> 01:00:37.530
Well, what does that mean?

01:00:37.564 --> 01:00:38.807
It means we don't
have to pretend

01:00:38.842 --> 01:00:40.775
to like each other anymore.

01:00:40.809 --> 01:00:42.880
Thank you for your service.

01:00:43.985 --> 01:00:45.227
Oh.

01:00:58.793 --> 01:01:00.001
Oh.

01:01:03.936 --> 01:01:05.523
Your kid is doing great.

01:01:05.558 --> 01:01:06.697
You should really be proud.

01:01:06.732 --> 01:01:09.182
Oh, I am, very much so.

01:01:09.217 --> 01:01:11.150
Listen, all this
talk of romance,

01:01:11.184 --> 01:01:13.462
I feel like there's
something I should clear up.

01:01:13.497 --> 01:01:14.601
Oh, and just when
our relationship

01:01:14.636 --> 01:01:16.224
was starting to feel so normal.

01:01:16.258 --> 01:01:18.916
Yeah, okay, um.

01:01:18.951 --> 01:01:22.782
You said earlier something
about chemistry between us

01:01:22.817 --> 01:01:24.957
and I kind of let that slide.

01:01:24.991 --> 01:01:29.409
The thing is, yes,
there is this chemistry,

01:01:29.444 --> 01:01:30.652
but I can't,

01:01:30.687 --> 01:01:32.654
it has been a while
since my husband died

01:01:32.689 --> 01:01:36.244
and I am getting there, but
I am just not there yet.

01:01:36.278 --> 01:01:37.210
No, I'm sorry.

01:01:37.245 --> 01:01:39.488
I should have been more clear.

01:01:39.523 --> 01:01:41.111
I can't date you.

01:01:41.145 --> 01:01:42.629
I'm your professor.

01:01:42.664 --> 01:01:47.255
Ethics apply, even students
who are closer to my own age.

01:01:48.187 --> 01:01:49.464
Right, of course.

01:01:49.498 --> 01:01:51.017
I just didn't wanna
read too much into-

01:01:51.052 --> 01:01:53.848
As long as you're in
my class, well then-

01:01:53.882 --> 01:01:54.987
No, message received.

01:01:59.474 --> 01:02:00.751
Just do me one favor.

01:02:00.786 --> 01:02:01.614
Of course.

01:02:03.961 --> 01:02:05.963
Don't take my
class next semester.

01:02:11.417 --> 01:02:15.490
I can do that.

01:02:24.361 --> 01:02:25.534
Hey, there.

01:02:25.569 --> 01:02:26.673
Thanks for coming.

01:02:26.708 --> 01:02:27.640
Good talk last night.

01:02:27.674 --> 01:02:29.297
So much better than a debate.

01:02:29.331 --> 01:02:30.850
Yeah, I thought so too.

01:02:30.885 --> 01:02:32.714
And congratulations
on the scholarship.

01:02:32.749 --> 01:02:34.612
Prof Murrow called me this
morning with the news.

01:02:34.647 --> 01:02:36.097
Noah, I'm so sorry.

01:02:36.131 --> 01:02:38.133
If I learned anything
from our debate,

01:02:38.168 --> 01:02:39.514
it's to be happy for you.

01:02:39.548 --> 01:02:40.757
Thanks.

01:02:40.791 --> 01:02:41.930
So?
So.

01:02:41.965 --> 01:02:44.105
Not at all awkward.

01:02:44.139 --> 01:02:45.554
I'll start.

01:02:45.589 --> 01:02:47.729
I'm hoping you asked to
meet, to maybe talk about us?

01:02:47.764 --> 01:02:49.731
Yeah, I'm not
ready to dive back

01:02:49.766 --> 01:02:51.284
into a boyfriend
girlfriend thing.

01:02:51.319 --> 01:02:52.838
I mean, there's still a
lot I need to think about.

01:02:52.872 --> 01:02:54.494
Right, no, me, too.

01:02:54.529 --> 01:02:56.876
But I was hoping maybe
we could start again

01:02:56.911 --> 01:02:58.533
with a clean slate.

01:02:58.567 --> 01:03:00.190
Can the clean slate
begin with dinner?

01:03:00.224 --> 01:03:01.536
It's like you read my mind.

01:03:01.570 --> 01:03:02.744
You did ask to
meet at the bistro

01:03:02.779 --> 01:03:04.642
so it wasn't that far of a leap.

01:03:06.472 --> 01:03:07.956
Oh, and just to clarify,

01:03:07.991 --> 01:03:09.337
that quote from the day we met,

01:03:09.371 --> 01:03:11.649
it's Silmarillion, I checked.

01:03:11.684 --> 01:03:13.513
At least I was right
that it was Tolkien.

01:03:13.548 --> 01:03:14.791
You were right.

01:03:14.825 --> 01:03:16.793
It was Tolkien from
the start!

01:03:16.827 --> 01:03:18.415
Hey, uh, nerds.

01:03:18.449 --> 01:03:19.554
Go get your own table.

01:03:20.797 --> 01:03:23.696
Yeah, we are so out of here.

01:03:23.730 --> 01:03:25.836
Yeah, let's go.

01:03:25.871 --> 01:03:27.286
They are such book geeks.

01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.185
So now, where were we?

01:03:30.220 --> 01:03:31.808
Favorite archers
in literature,

01:03:31.842 --> 01:03:34.086
left off with Katniss.
Legolas.

01:03:34.120 --> 01:03:35.639
No way.

01:03:35.673 --> 01:03:36.882
You only thought of that
because of the book nerds.

01:03:36.916 --> 01:03:38.469
Uh, so? Your turn.

01:03:40.437 --> 01:03:41.887
Clint Barton.

01:03:41.921 --> 01:03:43.854
Do comics really
count as literature?

01:03:43.889 --> 01:03:45.062
Duh.

01:03:45.097 --> 01:03:46.305
Just because you
add art to the words

01:03:46.339 --> 01:03:47.858
doesn't make the words
any less literature.

01:03:47.893 --> 01:03:49.032
Fine, Susan Pevensie.

01:03:49.998 --> 01:03:51.172
Nerd.

01:05:38.900 --> 01:05:40.522
Who?

01:05:40.557 --> 01:05:42.110
What was his name again?

01:05:42.145 --> 01:05:44.147
