WEBVTT

00:37.271 --> 00:40.708
Dude, what's with the gasp?
You almost gave me
a heart attack, yo.

00:40.741 --> 00:42.276
Did you hear that?

00:42.310 --> 00:44.678
No, that's why your gasp
was so unsettling.

00:44.712 --> 00:46.380
You don't gasp
when it's quiet.

00:46.414 --> 00:48.316
You just don't do that.
It scares us.

00:49.183 --> 00:50.551
But it's never this quiet.

00:50.584 --> 00:53.454
That is not the good reason
for the gasping, Robin!

00:53.487 --> 00:55.223
Yeah, bro, how do you like it?

00:56.790 --> 00:57.991
The gasp!

00:58.025 --> 01:01.395
I had to gasp, Titans, when
I realized why it's so quiet.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.563
Cyborg is missing!

01:04.632 --> 01:07.701
It has been sometime since
I heard the "booyah!"

01:07.735 --> 01:09.437
And it's unlike him
to disappear

01:09.470 --> 01:11.572
without telling us really
loudly where he's going.

01:11.605 --> 01:13.207
You think he's in trouble?

01:13.241 --> 01:15.543
There's only one way to
find out, the Titan Tracker!

01:15.576 --> 01:16.844
I implanted one in each of you

01:16.877 --> 01:18.546
without either your
knowledge or consent.

01:18.579 --> 01:21.815
Oh, so that is what
my glowy bulge friend is!

01:27.688 --> 01:30.824
Bad news! Wait for it.
Three-two-one.

01:30.858 --> 01:33.294
Cyborg is in
the H.I.V.E. Tower!

01:34.828 --> 01:35.929
Now I ask you,

01:35.963 --> 01:39.533
does anything feel better
than an appropriate gasp?

01:39.567 --> 01:42.170
Why would Cyborg be
in the H.I.V.E. Tower?

01:42.203 --> 01:44.772
Why don't we ask Gizmo?

01:44.805 --> 01:48.776
I was wondering how long
it would be before you noticed
your friend was missing.

01:50.244 --> 01:54.348
If you don't meet
our ransom demands,
you'll never see him again!

01:55.649 --> 01:57.385
Another great gasp, Titans.

01:57.418 --> 01:59.487
Are you telling them
you kidnapped me?

01:59.520 --> 02:00.788
You couldn't kidnap me
if you tried.

02:00.821 --> 02:04.225
Hey, Titans! I'm just
hanging here with my girl...

02:05.559 --> 02:07.761
I think he said
Jinx was trying to hang him!

02:08.729 --> 02:10.831
We really have those
gasps going now, Titans.

02:10.864 --> 02:14.302
If you want to see him again,
you'd better have my ransom.

02:14.335 --> 02:16.404
We must save the Cyborg.

02:18.539 --> 02:20.441
That one was for no reason.

02:21.609 --> 02:24.912
Now, let's save Cyborg.

02:28.582 --> 02:30.718
Oh, man!
Why did you do that?

02:30.751 --> 02:33.354
Now my mouth tastes like
your hand smells.

02:33.387 --> 02:35.256
Argh! Malodorous!

02:36.957 --> 02:38.959
And you're crazy if you think
they're gonna pay
a ransom for me.

02:38.992 --> 02:42.463
Well, how would I look
if they knew I was just
letting you hang around?

02:42.496 --> 02:43.931
Like a little baby
wearing a jet pack?

02:43.964 --> 02:47.235
I'm sick of your
boyfriend coming over here,

02:47.268 --> 02:49.537
eating our food
and sitting on our couch!

02:49.570 --> 02:50.871
He needs to leave!

02:50.904 --> 02:52.840
Why don't you leave?

02:52.873 --> 02:54.708
No, you leave.

02:54.742 --> 02:56.577
-You leave!
-You leave!

02:56.610 --> 02:58.312
-You leave!
-You leave!

02:58.346 --> 02:59.913
BOTH: You leave!

02:59.947 --> 03:01.949
-I said you leave!
-You leave!

03:01.982 --> 03:04.385
-You leave, leave...
You leave, leave...

03:04.418 --> 03:05.853
You, you, you, you, you leave!

03:05.886 --> 03:08.289
Leave! You, you, you leave!
Leave! You, you, you leave!

03:09.623 --> 03:11.825
You two have so much
in common.

03:11.859 --> 03:15.496
You love computers.
You're always inventing
those little gadgets.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.730
Why can't you be friends?

03:16.764 --> 03:19.567
-Because we can't!
-Yeah, that's why.

03:19.600 --> 03:23.404
Fine! But I better not catch
either of you messing
with each other.

03:23.437 --> 03:24.605
-Okay.
-All right.

03:24.638 --> 03:26.240
-Fine!
-Whatever.

03:26.274 --> 03:27.441
-Sure.
-All righty then.

03:27.475 --> 03:28.976
Okay!

03:29.009 --> 03:30.744
Okay...

03:30.778 --> 03:34.382
-Whatever.
-Okie-dokie...

03:34.415 --> 03:35.716
-All right!
-A'ight.

03:35.749 --> 03:38.719
-Mmm-hmm.
-Okie-dokie, then.

03:38.752 --> 03:41.489
-Whatever you say.
-It's all right.

03:41.522 --> 03:44.458
-Oh, hey, guys!

03:44.492 --> 03:46.226
Operation Tin Man is a go!

03:50.564 --> 03:51.999
ALL: Whoa!

03:52.032 --> 03:54.602
ROBIN: We'll be back
for you, Cyborg...

03:54.635 --> 03:57.771
Cool! I'll be here till
around 8:00 or 8:30.

03:57.805 --> 03:59.440
-Wait, did you want
to finish that movie?

03:59.473 --> 04:00.808
Make it 9:00!

04:02.676 --> 04:04.011
Listen carefully, H.I.V.E.

04:04.044 --> 04:06.747
I have a plan
to destroy Jump City.

04:06.780 --> 04:08.749
-And the first step is...

04:08.782 --> 04:11.385
Aw, you took your first step?

04:11.419 --> 04:13.287
Next we're gonna get you
on the potty!

04:16.056 --> 04:19.393
Does he have to be here while
we plot our evil schemes?

04:19.427 --> 04:21.562
Yes, we talked about this.

04:21.595 --> 04:22.663
Fine!

04:22.696 --> 04:24.498
My plan starts

04:24.532 --> 04:25.866
with this!

04:45.819 --> 04:48.021
This obviously is not
part of the plan!

04:48.055 --> 04:51.392
Well, it should be
because it's adorable!

04:56.530 --> 04:57.731
Cyborg!

04:57.765 --> 05:00.934
Great plan,
fearless leader.

05:21.121 --> 05:23.991
I really appreciate you
listening to me vent.

05:24.024 --> 05:26.860
I'm hanging on
every word, baby.

05:28.829 --> 05:30.898
-Uh!

05:30.931 --> 05:33.100
Cyborg

05:33.133 --> 05:34.468
Hello?

05:38.071 --> 05:41.742
Ugh! Is this your hilarious
way of telling me
you don't care?

05:43.477 --> 05:44.578
Hey!

05:44.612 --> 05:45.813
What's your problem?

05:45.846 --> 05:47.581
I don't know what
my problem is.

05:47.615 --> 05:50.384
But clearly there
is a problem.

05:52.720 --> 05:54.121
What are you doing?

05:54.154 --> 05:56.624
I... Whoa! Don't know...

05:56.657 --> 05:59.092
But I don't like it.

06:01.762 --> 06:03.797
Maybe I can do something
about that volume.

06:08.702 --> 06:10.938
Why are you
acting so weird, Cy?

06:10.971 --> 06:13.574
Because I am a big dumb-jerk,

06:13.607 --> 06:15.409
with a big dumb jerk face.

06:15.443 --> 06:17.010
We should break up.

06:17.044 --> 06:19.513
I am spending too much
time here and annoying
your friends.

06:19.547 --> 06:21.482
Booyah! Booyah! Booyah!

06:21.515 --> 06:23.050
Booyah!

06:23.083 --> 06:24.952
Oh!

06:28.221 --> 06:30.858
I don't like this side
of you, Cyborg.

06:38.699 --> 06:40.067
Love it!

06:40.100 --> 06:41.401
Hmph!

06:41.435 --> 06:45.539
Okay, Titans.
Our first mission to save
Cyborg didn't work.

06:45.573 --> 06:47.675
Time to turn to my skills

06:47.708 --> 06:49.810
as a master of disguise.

06:57.651 --> 06:59.119
Raven, what's our cover story?

06:59.152 --> 07:01.689
-We're just some...
-In character!

07:01.722 --> 07:03.991
We are the German tourists

07:04.024 --> 07:07.695
and we are wanting
to use the bathroom, please.

07:07.728 --> 07:08.929
Excellent, and...

07:08.962 --> 07:10.731
What's your name, Beast Boy?

07:10.764 --> 07:12.566
Uh, Beast Boy? Ow!

07:12.600 --> 07:15.669
-Are you trying
to get us killed?

07:15.703 --> 07:16.970
My name is Dieter.

07:17.004 --> 07:19.907
My Papa runs a chocolate shop
on ze Hamburg.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.675
And what about you, Fraeulein?

07:21.709 --> 07:24.712
I am also eating
the hamburger.

07:25.679 --> 07:27.180
You do not eat the hamburger!

07:27.214 --> 07:28.582
You are the hamburger.

07:28.616 --> 07:29.750
You live in Hamburg!

07:29.783 --> 07:31.552
Get it straight, Fraeulein!

07:31.585 --> 07:33.220
Or we all die!

07:33.253 --> 07:36.824
Stick to our story
and we just might be able
to pull this off.

07:36.857 --> 07:38.959
-ALL: Ja!

07:43.531 --> 07:44.798
Who is it?

07:44.832 --> 07:47.535
We are weary travelers

07:47.568 --> 07:49.069
with an interesting story...

07:52.640 --> 07:55.643
Go away! No solicitors!

07:55.676 --> 07:56.844
-I don't know.

07:58.846 --> 08:02.583
Now don't think I don't know
that you two have been
pranking each other.

08:02.616 --> 08:04.217
BOTH: What?

08:04.251 --> 08:06.754
You two are gonna
hang out until you're cool
with each other.

08:17.598 --> 08:19.066
Ugh! Your room's boring.

08:19.099 --> 08:20.801
You got a rattle I can
play with or something?

08:20.834 --> 08:22.269
No rattles.

08:22.302 --> 08:24.972
Just devices to destroy
the Titans with.

08:32.913 --> 08:35.616
How's that
gonna destroy us?

08:35.649 --> 08:37.250
It's a surveillance drone.

08:37.284 --> 08:39.753
I'm gonna use it
to find your weaknesses.

08:39.787 --> 08:43.223
It's too loud!
We'd hear it coming
from a mile away.

08:43.256 --> 08:44.892
Here, give it to me.

08:47.327 --> 08:49.830
Whoa! How'd you do that?

08:49.863 --> 08:51.765
You're not the only
gadget genius.

08:51.799 --> 08:53.300
Now, watch.

08:56.937 --> 08:59.306
Don't worry, Cyborg,
help is coming.

08:59.339 --> 09:01.675
We just need
to upgrade the arsenal.

09:01.709 --> 09:03.711
Starting with these guns...

09:03.744 --> 09:05.078
Hah! Look at those pecs!

09:05.112 --> 09:06.914
They're positively glistening.

09:06.947 --> 09:09.349
Booty quake-shake!
Booty quake-shake! Hoo-ha!

09:13.220 --> 09:15.055
Mmm... Huh?

09:36.176 --> 09:37.044
BOTH: Oh!

09:47.955 --> 09:49.857
CYBORG: Oh, my gosh.

09:52.926 --> 09:54.962
It's nice to finally see
my boys getting along.

09:54.995 --> 09:56.697
I told you, you have
a lot in common.

09:56.730 --> 10:00.033
I should have kidnapped
you a long time ago, dude.

10:00.067 --> 10:01.234
You can say that again.

10:01.268 --> 10:02.936
If Robin calls
about that ransom,

10:02.970 --> 10:04.705
add some fries for me.

10:04.738 --> 10:07.741
-I'm getting hungry.
-For you, I'll make it
chili fries.

10:07.775 --> 10:08.842
Best friends?

10:08.876 --> 10:11.779
Nah! Best friends forever.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.020
Hi! You wanted a ransom
for Cyborg?

10:20.053 --> 10:21.621
Well, here it is!

10:35.769 --> 10:36.937
Little buddy!
