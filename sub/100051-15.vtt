00:09.574 --> 00:11.315
- In the criminal justice
system,

00:11.359 --> 00:12.664
sexually based offenses

00:12.708 --> 00:15.145
are considered
especially heinous.

00:15.189 --> 00:17.495
In New York City,
the dedicated detectives

00:17.539 --> 00:19.323
who investigate
these vicious felonies

00:19.367 --> 00:20.716
are members of an elite squad

00:20.759 --> 00:22.761
known as
the Special Victims Unit.

00:22.805 --> 00:25.677
These are their stories.

that you want a piece of ♪

00:29.290 --> 00:31.683

00:31.727 --> 00:33.816
♪ This is the fame

00:33.859 --> 00:36.645

a piece of me ♪

00:36.688 --> 00:38.473
♪ Again and again

00:38.516 --> 00:40.170
- This is pretty.

00:40.214 --> 00:42.303
- Yeah, it says here
that goes up your...

00:42.346 --> 00:43.521
- Oh.
- Mm-hmm.

00:45.132 --> 00:47.177
- It's a positive message,
I guess,

00:47.221 --> 00:49.223
empowering women
through wellness.

00:49.266 --> 00:50.746
- The message
I'm getting...

00:52.487 --> 00:56.186
Spend money--lots of it.
- Wow.

00:56.230 --> 00:58.275
- Why sex?

00:58.319 --> 01:00.364
Why not sex?

01:00.408 --> 01:05.195
At We-B-Well, we believe
in wellness for the whole self.

01:05.239 --> 01:07.676
Be well.
Be hot.

01:07.719 --> 01:10.548
Be happy.
- Luna, we love you!

01:10.592 --> 01:13.551
- [laughs]
I love you too.

01:13.595 --> 01:18.513
And women need to know
it's okay to love our bodies...

01:18.556 --> 01:19.992
[crowd cheers]

01:20.036 --> 01:24.693
Especially the parts
they tell us not to talk about.

01:24.736 --> 01:26.390
[crowd cheering]

01:26.434 --> 01:28.914
Come on, ladies.
Don't be shy.

01:28.958 --> 01:32.222
Show me some love.
See you on stage.

01:32.266 --> 01:34.311

01:35.878 --> 01:37.619

Captain Benson?

01:37.662 --> 01:39.882
- Oh, I'm good to go.
- Okay.

01:39.925 --> 01:42.189
Well, Luna's so sorry she
couldn't welcome you in person.

01:42.232 --> 01:43.712
She can't wait to meet you.
- Ah.

01:43.755 --> 01:46.584
- Okay, that's the crescendo.
I love it.

01:46.628 --> 01:48.238
Captain Benson.
- Yes.

01:48.282 --> 01:50.501
- Olivia.
May I call you that?

01:50.545 --> 01:53.374
Luna Prasada,
She-E-O of We-B-Well.

01:53.417 --> 01:57.595
Let me just say,
I am so impressed by you.

01:57.639 --> 01:58.596
- Well, thank you.

01:58.640 --> 01:59.728
Thank you so much
for having me.

01:59.771 --> 02:01.512
- Hi, I'm Melanie, the COO.

02:01.556 --> 02:04.602
We're so happy that--
- Thank you so much for coming.

02:04.646 --> 02:06.778
You must be so busy
since Me Too.

02:06.822 --> 02:09.477
- You know, we are, but
any time I can raise awareness,

02:09.520 --> 02:11.305
I'm just happy for the chance.

02:11.348 --> 02:14.308
- Us girls--we run the world,
and in our spare time,

02:14.351 --> 02:16.136
we try to fix it too.
Come on.

02:17.572 --> 02:21.271
So when we're attacked,

02:21.315 --> 02:24.492
our brains
don't process information

02:24.535 --> 02:26.668
in a linear way.

02:26.711 --> 02:31.629
We revert
to our...lizard brain?

02:31.673 --> 02:35.285
- Yes, because the frontal lobe
shuts down,

02:35.329 --> 02:37.418
and our body reacts in a--

02:37.461 --> 02:42.205
- So when lawyers or senators
ask why we don't remember

02:42.249 --> 02:44.207
all the specifics,
it's because--

02:44.251 --> 02:48.298
- It's because trauma
is processed in a sensory way--

02:48.342 --> 02:50.692
by sounds or smells,

02:50.735 --> 02:53.651
not who, what, and when.

02:53.695 --> 02:57.655
Revisiting trauma isn't easy.

02:57.699 --> 03:00.919
Survival takes strength.

03:02.573 --> 03:04.532
- [sighs]

03:04.575 --> 03:08.753
Survival takes strength.

03:10.015 --> 03:12.801
Wow.

03:12.844 --> 03:14.977
You mind if I steal that?

03:15.020 --> 03:17.980
[laughing]

03:18.023 --> 03:21.375
[cheers and applause]

03:21.418 --> 03:23.768
Let's give it up!

Ladies?

03:25.379 --> 03:28.382
[applause continues]
- Thank you.

03:29.731 --> 03:32.995
- Her car comes in 20.
Enjoy your face time.

03:33.038 --> 03:34.866
- [chuckles]

03:34.910 --> 03:36.781
I see you.
I hear you.

03:36.825 --> 03:38.957
I-I am with you.

03:39.001 --> 03:43.310
[sighs]
Bobby, finally.

03:43.353 --> 03:45.790
Sweetie, can you hold this
for a minute?

03:45.834 --> 03:48.271
[sighs]

03:48.315 --> 03:50.491
Question for you, Bobby.

03:56.627 --> 03:58.934
Question is...

04:00.936 --> 04:04.026
Saffron or the chive?

04:04.069 --> 04:07.943
- Luna, this IPO, going public,
it's not business as usual.

04:09.423 --> 04:14.428
- Sweetie, we just had
a fantastic three days, okay?

04:14.471 --> 04:18.475
So enjoy the moment, huh?

04:18.519 --> 04:21.609
We have edibles,

04:21.652 --> 04:24.916
and we have drinkables,

04:24.960 --> 04:28.529
so let's just live a little.

04:28.572 --> 04:29.573
- Yeah.
- Uh-huh?

04:29.617 --> 04:30.879
- I've been going
through the books.

04:30.922 --> 04:34.578
- [sighs]
Bobby, you do numbers.

04:34.622 --> 04:36.406
I do ideas...
- Yeah.

04:36.450 --> 04:40.323
- Brilliant ideas, okay?

04:40.367 --> 04:43.587
- Good for you, but you're CEO.

04:43.631 --> 04:44.806
You'll be signing
the statements.

04:44.849 --> 04:46.329
I want you to know
what's in them.

04:46.373 --> 04:48.026
- Okay.

04:48.070 --> 04:50.072
First we drink,

04:50.115 --> 04:54.032
and then you can show me
your little PowerPoint.

04:57.122 --> 04:58.994
- The audience
really appreciated you.

04:59.037 --> 05:00.474
- Well, they were there
for Luna.

05:00.517 --> 05:01.779
- So was Luna.
- [chuckles]

05:01.823 --> 05:03.128
- Why invite you on the panel

05:03.172 --> 05:04.565
if she's gonna cut you off
every five seconds?

05:04.608 --> 05:05.696
- She is high energy.

05:05.740 --> 05:06.871
I'll give her that.
[phone vibrates]

05:06.915 --> 05:07.785
- Don't tell me
you bought something.

05:07.829 --> 05:08.786
- What?

05:08.830 --> 05:10.832
My sister's birthday
is coming up.

05:10.875 --> 05:14.401
- Text from Luna's assistant.
She says it's urgent.

05:14.444 --> 05:16.664
- Whatever she's asking,
just say no.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.668
- See you guys later.
- All right.

05:20.711 --> 05:22.844
- Hey.
- Hi, um...

05:22.887 --> 05:25.673
Luna didn't want
to bother you, but--

05:27.849 --> 05:29.590
- Olivia?

05:29.633 --> 05:30.634
- Hey, Luna.

05:32.070 --> 05:33.855
What's going on?
What happened?

05:35.422 --> 05:36.597
- I was raped.

05:38.599 --> 05:43.081
Oh, God,
why would he do this to me?

[dramatic music]

05:55.529 --> 06:02.536
♪

06:40.225 --> 06:43.707
- I just wanna take
a long, hot shower.

06:43.751 --> 06:45.753
- Well, we're almost done here.

06:45.796 --> 06:49.191
She's gonna get you
some antibiotics.

06:49.234 --> 06:51.149
Here's some water.
- Thank you.

06:51.193 --> 06:55.153
- Luna, you said that Bobby
came up to your room?

06:55.197 --> 06:58.679
- Yeah, he's our CFO.

06:58.722 --> 07:02.465
I keep putting him off because
he's always got bad news.

07:02.509 --> 07:05.642
I call him "Bum Me Out Bobby."

07:05.686 --> 07:06.991
- Okay, go on.

07:07.035 --> 07:11.692
- Well, I offered him a drink
to relax him a bit.

07:11.735 --> 07:15.957
I have to admit, I was
ahead of him on that front.

07:16.000 --> 07:17.567
- Mm-hmm, that's okay.

07:17.611 --> 07:18.916
- We never got
to the financials.

07:18.960 --> 07:20.831
He took a shot of tequila.

07:20.875 --> 07:24.531
He pushed me down on the bed.

07:24.574 --> 07:27.185
I wanted to push him off...

07:31.320 --> 07:33.583
But I just froze.

07:33.627 --> 07:35.585
It was just like you said.

07:35.629 --> 07:40.503
I...I just wanted to survive.

07:40.547 --> 07:42.244
- And your relationship
with him,

07:42.287 --> 07:45.552
has it changed recently?

07:45.595 --> 07:48.772
- It's become more tense.

07:48.816 --> 07:54.561
We were about
to announce our IPO--

07:54.604 --> 07:57.999
oh, my God.
I can't do this.

07:58.042 --> 07:59.566
If this comes out,

07:59.609 --> 08:01.655
the whole thing
is just gonna go poof.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.526
I can't believe
he did this to me.

08:03.570 --> 08:04.962
I can't believe it.

08:05.006 --> 08:06.877
Look, you can do
your investigation,

08:06.921 --> 08:08.183
but I'm not gonna
press charges.

08:08.226 --> 08:12.535
- That is your decision,
but the good news is

08:12.579 --> 08:15.843
that if you change your mind,
we got the rape kit done.

08:17.235 --> 08:19.150
- I don't think
you realize this,

08:19.194 --> 08:21.979
but my whole brand depends

08:22.023 --> 08:25.156
on women wanting to be me,

08:25.200 --> 08:27.985
and rape...

08:28.029 --> 08:31.685
does not fit
into that picture.

08:36.951 --> 08:39.997
- Bobby Frost,
Stanford frat boy.

08:40.041 --> 08:41.608
A decade in Silicon Valley

08:41.651 --> 08:45.742
before becoming the CFO
of Luna's company, We-B-Well.

08:45.786 --> 08:47.222
- Any criminal record?

08:47.265 --> 08:50.355
- College DUIs, a divorce
with mutual DV allegations--

08:50.399 --> 08:52.706
basically, nothing worse
than your typical congressman.

08:52.749 --> 08:55.230
- Well, security cams show
Frost entering Luna's suite

08:55.273 --> 08:57.841
at 8:30 p.m. and exiting
34 minutes later.

08:57.885 --> 09:00.061
- Did we get results
from the rape kit and her exam?

09:00.104 --> 09:01.758
- Yeah, tox screen
showed high levels

09:01.802 --> 09:03.325
of alcohol,
marijuana, and Adderall.

09:03.368 --> 09:04.892
- Which she also told me about.

09:04.935 --> 09:07.242
- Also the presence
of trauma and semen,

09:07.285 --> 09:08.678
not inconsistent with assault.

09:08.722 --> 09:10.071
- Also not inconsistent
with rough sex

09:10.114 --> 09:11.594
if he gets
a good defense attorney.

09:11.638 --> 09:14.075
- Thank you, Counselor.
- How cooperative is Luna?

09:14.118 --> 09:16.033
- She said that we can start
the investigation,

09:16.077 --> 09:17.469
but she's afraid

09:17.513 --> 09:19.950
of how it will affect
her company's upcoming IPO.

09:19.994 --> 09:21.604
- Any outcry witnesses?

09:21.648 --> 09:23.214
- Yes, her assistant, Sequoia,

09:23.258 --> 09:25.216
texted me
right after it happened.

09:25.260 --> 09:26.783
- All right,
take her statement,

09:26.827 --> 09:29.351
and let's see if we can catch
this guy Frost off guard.

09:29.394 --> 09:31.396
- Yeah.

09:31.440 --> 09:33.616
[dramatic music]

09:33.660 --> 09:35.139
- One thing led to another.

09:36.358 --> 09:39.100
I mean, you've seen her.
It was really hard to say no.

09:39.143 --> 09:41.668
- So you and Luna did have sex?

09:41.711 --> 09:45.149
- Yes...consensual.

09:45.193 --> 09:46.760
Oh, no, what is she saying?

09:46.803 --> 09:48.413
Is she accusing me
of something?

09:48.457 --> 09:50.241
- Just tell us what happened.

09:50.285 --> 09:52.940
- Right after we...finished,

09:52.983 --> 09:55.246
Sequoia walked in
and freaked out.

09:57.031 --> 10:00.164
[chuckles]
Oh, no.

10:00.208 --> 10:02.645
That's what this is about.

10:02.689 --> 10:05.430
No, Sequoia and Luna
are involved,

10:05.474 --> 10:08.390
so Luna couldn't admit
that she was cheating on her.

10:08.433 --> 10:09.957
She's making this up.

10:12.133 --> 10:15.397
Full confession--Luna and I
used to be involved.

10:15.440 --> 10:18.182
- Who broke it off?
- I did.

10:18.226 --> 10:20.924
Sex was against our HR policy.

10:20.968 --> 10:23.274
Smash cut
to a few months later--

10:23.318 --> 10:25.755
Luna is a proud pansexual.

10:25.799 --> 10:28.671
She's got this hot,
new 25-year-old assistant.

10:28.715 --> 10:31.761
She promptly bumps her up
to CLO.

10:31.805 --> 10:34.764
- CLO?
- Chief listening officer.

10:34.808 --> 10:35.939
You ever hear of that?

10:39.334 --> 10:41.989
- I walked in,
and he was on top of her.

10:44.818 --> 10:47.385
[quietly]
Okay, she saw me.

10:47.429 --> 10:50.084
She screamed for help.
He ran out.

10:50.127 --> 10:52.695
She said he assaulted her.

10:52.739 --> 10:54.262
- Bobby Frost told my captain

10:54.305 --> 10:57.439
that you and Luna
are also lovers?

10:59.920 --> 11:02.966
- Did he also tell you
he's furious about it?

11:03.010 --> 11:07.057
He claims it's an HR issue,
but it's his toxic ego.

11:09.016 --> 11:12.367
He hates that I make her happy
when he couldn't.

11:14.108 --> 11:15.762
- Okay.

11:17.285 --> 11:20.941
- Seriously, I-I don't see
how that is relevant.

11:20.984 --> 11:24.901
- Luna, we need to know
everything that happened--

11:24.945 --> 11:27.338
everything that Bobby knows.

11:27.382 --> 11:31.908
And you didn't mention to us
that Sequoia walked in.

11:31.952 --> 11:35.085
- I did not mention Sequoia

11:35.129 --> 11:39.350
because I was trying
to protect her.

11:39.394 --> 11:42.440
The fact is he raped me.

11:42.484 --> 11:45.443
And now he is accusing me
of making this up?

11:45.487 --> 11:47.750
- That's what rapists do.

11:47.794 --> 11:49.796
His DNA is on the kit,

11:49.839 --> 11:54.496
so he admits what he can't deny
and denies what he can't admit.

11:54.539 --> 11:56.193
- Son of a bitch.

11:56.237 --> 11:58.021
He thinks he'll get away
with this because he knows

11:58.065 --> 11:59.762
I'm not gonna jeopardize
my company.

11:59.806 --> 12:02.939
- There's always reasons
for women to stay silent.

12:02.983 --> 12:06.290
But the good news is,
the world is changing.

12:06.334 --> 12:09.816
There's no stigma
in coming forward.

12:09.859 --> 12:13.428
It can be empowering...

12:13.471 --> 12:15.865
heroic, even.

12:15.909 --> 12:19.434
- Survival takes strength.

12:19.477 --> 12:21.175
- Yes.

12:21.218 --> 12:23.046
- [sighs]

12:26.093 --> 12:28.399
- Bobby Frost.

12:28.443 --> 12:29.966
- In the middle
of a meal here.

12:30.010 --> 12:31.446
- Yeah, we're gonna need you
to come with us.

12:31.489 --> 12:33.840
- Whatever Luna said to you,
it's a lie.

12:33.883 --> 12:35.580
- Well, then you have nothing
to worry about.

12:35.624 --> 12:36.930
Come talk.

12:36.973 --> 12:39.062
- Look...

12:39.106 --> 12:42.326
There's something
I didn't tell you before.

12:42.370 --> 12:45.242
I found out she's been robbing
the company blind,

12:45.286 --> 12:48.768
and I confronted her.
That's why she's crying rape.

12:51.858 --> 12:53.598
- We're still gonna
need to talk.

12:53.642 --> 12:56.558
Let's go.

13:06.089 --> 13:06.481
.

13:06.524 --> 13:08.004
- You should know,

13:08.048 --> 13:09.876
she's not Luna Prasada
from Darien.

13:09.919 --> 13:12.313
She's Lori Wisznewski
from Hackensack.

13:12.356 --> 13:13.836
- That's not a crime, Bobby.

13:13.880 --> 13:16.012
- It's a tell, but I hear you.

13:16.056 --> 13:18.667
It didn't bother me
at first either.

13:18.710 --> 13:21.322
She's created her whole persona
as a sales tool,

13:21.365 --> 13:22.845
and it worked.

13:22.889 --> 13:25.500
- Until my client started
preparing the IPO prospectus.

13:25.543 --> 13:27.458
- Due diligence, huh?

13:27.502 --> 13:29.417
So what'd you find out?

13:29.460 --> 13:32.463
- Well, at first, small things.

13:32.507 --> 13:34.901
Travel and expenses
were overly generous.

13:34.944 --> 13:37.555
Spa visits categorized
as research.

13:37.599 --> 13:40.428
Then I dig deeper
and, fast-forward--

13:40.471 --> 13:42.517
- She's embezzling
on a major scale.

13:42.560 --> 13:45.389
- But you didn't report
that to the DA or the SEC?

13:45.433 --> 13:48.088
- Or us
when we first talked to you?

13:48.131 --> 13:50.307
- My client's only crime
is putting his concern

13:50.351 --> 13:52.788
for his company
over his concern for himself.

13:52.832 --> 13:55.443
- If word gets out,
this torpedoes the IPO,

13:55.486 --> 13:58.011
thousands of jobs gone,
but Luna is forcing my hand.

13:58.054 --> 13:59.403
- One last chance--

13:59.447 --> 14:01.014
what happened when you walked
into Luna's room?

14:02.842 --> 14:04.408
- I showed her my spreadsheets.
- Mm-hmm.

14:04.452 --> 14:05.932
- I told her she could
reimburse the company,

14:05.975 --> 14:07.324
and we could paper it over.

14:07.368 --> 14:08.891
- And how did she respond
to that?

14:08.935 --> 14:10.632
- By seducing me.

14:10.675 --> 14:13.635
She takes off her clothes.
She gets down on her knees.

14:13.678 --> 14:15.898
- And you went along with it.

14:15.942 --> 14:17.682
- We get the picture.
Go on.

14:17.726 --> 14:18.858
- She pulls me

14:18.901 --> 14:22.774
into that feng shui thing
she calls a bed.

14:22.818 --> 14:24.907
We're going at it,
and, boom, her assistant,

14:24.951 --> 14:26.474
Sequoia, walks in.

14:26.517 --> 14:29.781
Luna pushes me off of her
and cries rape.

14:29.825 --> 14:31.479
- So you're the victim here?

14:31.522 --> 14:35.352
- Thank you.
Yeah, me and the company too.

14:35.396 --> 14:37.093
- He raped me,
and now he is

14:37.137 --> 14:40.140
just making stuff up,
all right?

14:40.183 --> 14:43.099
It's pathological.
Maybe it's neurological.

14:43.143 --> 14:45.710
Maybe his frontal lobe is shot.
I don't know.

14:45.754 --> 14:47.843
- Well, he claims
that he has evidence.

14:49.627 --> 14:52.500
- Well, he can't,
because there is none.

14:52.543 --> 14:57.026
I mean, We-B-Well is my child.
It's my life.

14:57.070 --> 14:59.855
I just don't even know
where I end and it begins.

14:59.899 --> 15:01.378
- Luna, I hear you,

15:01.422 --> 15:04.860
but we are obligated
to investigate his charge.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.907
- Well,
maybe that's a good thing,

15:07.950 --> 15:12.476
because I did not do this,
and you will see that,

15:12.520 --> 15:16.045
and in the meantime,
you will arrest him.

15:16.089 --> 15:17.873
- Well, not yet.

15:17.917 --> 15:22.095
The DA thinks
that if his defense

15:22.138 --> 15:25.881
is your claiming rape
to cover up embezzlement,

15:25.925 --> 15:27.709
then we have to hold off.

15:27.752 --> 15:29.537
- Come on, this is psychotic.

15:29.580 --> 15:31.147
He's still working for me.
I mean, I gotta go.

15:31.191 --> 15:32.627
I gotta fire him.

15:32.670 --> 15:34.498
- No, no, no, no, you can't
have any contact with Bobby.

15:34.542 --> 15:35.847
Listen to me.

15:35.891 --> 15:38.502
You can't do anything
to strengthen his hand.

15:40.940 --> 15:42.028
- Bobby Frost gave you these?

15:42.071 --> 15:43.638
- Yeah, he said,
as chief tech officer,

15:43.681 --> 15:46.597
you could shed light
on some of these IT expenses.

15:46.641 --> 15:51.646
Like this one here, yeah,
for $800,000.

15:51.689 --> 15:52.690
That's your signature?

15:54.127 --> 15:56.694
- I sign off on dozens
of projects every month.

15:56.738 --> 15:58.131
- So that's a yes?

15:58.174 --> 16:00.089
Did you get any feedback
about the work that was done?

16:00.133 --> 16:02.135
- I don't recall
receiving any complaints.

16:02.178 --> 16:03.223
- Yeah, you wouldn't have

16:03.266 --> 16:06.791
because the vendor
doesn't exist.

16:06.835 --> 16:09.490
It's a shell company, and when
we try to track the money down,

16:09.533 --> 16:13.146
it disappears
into a Caribbean LLC.

16:14.582 --> 16:17.150
- I'm not laundering money.
- Then who submitted the bill?

16:23.547 --> 16:26.202
- It was Luna Prasada.

16:27.638 --> 16:29.727
- Did she say
what the work was for?

16:29.771 --> 16:31.860
- Not specifically, no.
- You didn't ask?

16:31.903 --> 16:33.644
You usually sign
six-figure checks

16:33.688 --> 16:34.863
without knowing
what they're for?

16:34.906 --> 16:36.778
- She made it clear
that wasn't my concern.

16:36.821 --> 16:38.954
Look, she's starting
a charitable foundation.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.609
She mentioned needing to move
money around for tax reasons.

16:41.652 --> 16:43.915
She swore it was all legal.
- And you just went along?

16:43.959 --> 16:46.483
- She's the boss.

16:46.527 --> 16:48.181
The tech officer before me?

16:48.224 --> 16:49.965
She fired him
because she didn't like

16:50.009 --> 16:51.532
the color of his aura.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.926
- So Vinay said
that she was diverting

16:54.970 --> 16:56.885
our tech budget
to fund the foundation?

16:56.928 --> 16:58.930
My God.
[sighs]

16:58.974 --> 17:00.149
There's no saying no to Luna.

17:00.193 --> 17:02.064
- But you're
the chief operating officer.

17:02.108 --> 17:04.893
It's your job
to keep her in line, right?

17:04.936 --> 17:08.679
- She's the majority
shareholder of her own company.

17:08.723 --> 17:11.769
The board is
all of her rich girlfriends.

17:11.813 --> 17:13.119
It's Luna's world.

17:13.162 --> 17:15.077
None of us would be here
without her.

17:15.121 --> 17:16.774
- Is it possible
that she was using

17:16.818 --> 17:18.994
the foundation
as a personal account?

17:19.038 --> 17:20.169
- How do you mean?

17:20.213 --> 17:23.520
- There are wire transfers
to offshore LLCs.

17:23.564 --> 17:25.087
There's payments
to shell companies.

17:25.131 --> 17:28.525
Eleven checks made out to cash,
$9,000 each,

17:28.569 --> 17:30.875
deposited by a Tisa Chee.

17:30.919 --> 17:33.269
- Tisa, she worked in creative.

17:33.313 --> 17:34.792
I didn't know
these were for her,

17:34.836 --> 17:36.838
but Luna did ask me
to approve these payments.

17:36.881 --> 17:38.013
- Did she tell you
what they were for?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.797
- Consulting fees.

17:39.841 --> 17:42.713
- We need to get
in touch with Ms. Chee.

17:45.151 --> 17:47.109
- I left We-B-Well
a few months ago.

17:47.153 --> 17:49.111
- But you're still consulting
there, right?

17:49.155 --> 17:52.680
- No--I mean, yes.
- Which is it?

17:52.723 --> 17:55.683
We're following up
on some fees you were paid--

17:55.726 --> 17:58.860
11 checks written out
to cash for $9,000.

17:58.903 --> 18:02.559
- Multiple checks all just
under the IRS reporting limit--

18:02.603 --> 18:04.170
that's called structuring.

18:04.213 --> 18:05.301
- I signed an NDA.

18:05.345 --> 18:06.607
I can't talk
about Luna or the company.

18:06.650 --> 18:10.045
- Tisa, you're looking
at serious charges here.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.047
An NDA isn't going
to protect you.

18:12.091 --> 18:13.266
- I didn't do anything wrong.

18:13.309 --> 18:14.354
- Then you need to tell us

18:14.397 --> 18:17.183
what those payments
were really for.

18:19.968 --> 18:21.230
- To keep me quiet.

18:22.927 --> 18:24.146
- About what?

18:24.190 --> 18:26.061
About Luna stealing
from the company?

18:26.105 --> 18:28.324
- What?
No.

18:28.368 --> 18:30.674
She sexually assaulted me.

18:34.113 --> 18:36.767
We were at a retreat
on Lake George.

18:36.811 --> 18:38.204
They don't usually invite
my level,

18:38.247 --> 18:40.945
but Luna
specifically asked for me.

18:40.989 --> 18:42.773
- When did the assault happen?

18:42.817 --> 18:44.601
- The second night.

18:44.645 --> 18:47.038
Luna invited me
to her private cabin.

18:47.082 --> 18:48.736
I thought it was gonna be
all the creatives,

18:48.779 --> 18:51.086
but it turned out
it was just me.

18:52.870 --> 18:55.177
She offered me tequila.

18:55.221 --> 18:57.005
You're probably thinking,

18:57.048 --> 18:59.094
"She's my boss.
I should have said no."

18:59.138 --> 19:00.704
- We're not thinking that.

19:03.229 --> 19:07.972
- Um, then she wanted me
to try out a new product--

19:08.016 --> 19:11.933
a, um, Vi-Brildo?

19:11.976 --> 19:16.720
It's kind of a combination
of a vibrator and a--

19:16.764 --> 19:18.026
- Yeah, we get it.

19:19.680 --> 19:22.944
- She wanted me to use it

19:22.987 --> 19:25.686
on myself...

19:25.729 --> 19:27.775
in front of her.

19:27.818 --> 19:30.778
I didn't want to, so she said,

19:30.821 --> 19:34.042
"Okay, just try out
our bondage tape."

19:34.085 --> 19:39.134
Once I was
pleasure restrained,

19:39.178 --> 19:42.268
she forced me down

19:42.311 --> 19:45.271
and used the device on me...

19:48.012 --> 19:51.929
And, um, inside me.

20:00.938 --> 20:01.287
.

20:01.330 --> 20:05.856
- Tisa Chee,
she was in product testing.

20:05.900 --> 20:10.165
New scents, toys...
- Vibrators.

20:10.209 --> 20:12.820
- Well,
hopefully not in the office.

20:12.863 --> 20:14.865
- And how 'bout
on a corporate retreat?

20:14.909 --> 20:16.606
- You said new allegations
have been raised.

20:16.650 --> 20:18.086
Can we get to them?

20:18.129 --> 20:21.829
- Yeah, Tisa Chee is claiming
that you bondage taped her

20:21.872 --> 20:26.399
and then used the device on her
against her will.

20:26.442 --> 20:29.228
- Wait, what?
That's insane.

20:29.271 --> 20:30.446
- Now, but she did come

20:30.490 --> 20:32.056
on the corporate retreat
to Lake George?

20:32.100 --> 20:36.278
- It was a team building event.
I think her whole group came.

20:36.322 --> 20:37.975
- Okay, were you ever alone
with her?

20:38.019 --> 20:39.586
- It's possible.

20:39.629 --> 20:41.544
- What is she claiming exactly?

20:41.588 --> 20:43.981
- That Luna invited Tisa
back to her cabin,

20:44.025 --> 20:45.505
offered her tequila,

20:45.548 --> 20:47.637
and then when she wouldn't
test--the Vi-Brildo, is it?

20:47.681 --> 20:49.900
Bondage taped her to the bed
and forced it on her.

20:49.944 --> 20:51.119
- Okay, this is ludicrous,

20:51.162 --> 20:53.774
because I never stepped foot
in that cabin.

20:53.817 --> 20:57.647
I stayed in the main lodge
in a suite with Sequoia.

20:57.691 --> 20:59.606
- What is this,
open season on my client?

20:59.649 --> 21:02.435
Anyone who wants to can make up
a completely specious claim?

21:02.478 --> 21:06.874
- We do have an apology email
that you wrote to Tisa.

21:06.917 --> 21:08.876
This is your email account?

21:10.443 --> 21:11.661
- I never wrote this.

21:11.705 --> 21:17.798
- And you didn't authorize
these 11 payments?

21:25.327 --> 21:27.242
Or this NDA?

21:33.727 --> 21:35.381
- I've never seen this.

21:36.643 --> 21:40.255
- Okay, that's not
what your COO said.

21:41.952 --> 21:45.652
- Oh, Melanie?
Well, that's impossible.

21:45.695 --> 21:47.436
- We need some time
to go over these documents.

21:47.480 --> 21:49.003
- Yeah, you do.

21:55.966 --> 21:57.794
- Luna is not the easiest,

21:57.838 --> 21:59.796
but I believe
in what we've built,

21:59.840 --> 22:02.930
and I can't say anything
that's gonna damage the IPO.

22:02.973 --> 22:04.497
- No, we're way past that now.

22:04.540 --> 22:06.542
You're looking at fraud,
money laundering--

22:06.586 --> 22:08.022
- I was only doing my job.

22:08.065 --> 22:09.676
- Well, traditionally,
not a great excuse

22:09.719 --> 22:11.068
for breaking the law.

22:11.112 --> 22:13.941
- Mr. Gupta, if you're aware
of any criminal acts

22:13.984 --> 22:17.423
by your CEO, now's the time
to reveal them.

22:20.426 --> 22:22.950
- An offshore LLC?

22:22.993 --> 22:24.778
Well, I'd have to dig in
a little.

22:24.821 --> 22:26.562
I'm sure it was
for tax reasons.

22:26.606 --> 22:27.824
- I spent five years

22:27.868 --> 22:29.652
in white collar crime,
Ms. Franks.

22:29.696 --> 22:32.916
I see offshore LLCs,
that's a red flag.

22:32.960 --> 22:35.876
- Yeah, most often
for embezzlement,

22:35.919 --> 22:37.573
drug running,
or money laundering,

22:37.617 --> 22:39.488
so which are you involved with?

22:39.532 --> 22:40.359
- None of them.

22:43.623 --> 22:46.756
I tried to tell Luna
it would look bad.

22:46.800 --> 22:48.758
She stopped listening to me.

22:48.802 --> 22:50.717
We've known each other
a long time.

22:50.760 --> 22:54.329
Her star rising, the money,
celebrity friends...

22:56.157 --> 22:58.377
She let it go to her head.

23:01.423 --> 23:02.816
My mother used to say,

23:02.859 --> 23:05.645
"You climb too fast,
you end up gasping for air."

23:08.474 --> 23:11.085
- You're arresting me?
Are you serious?

23:11.128 --> 23:12.086
For what?

23:12.129 --> 23:14.436
- Embezzlement,
money laundering,

23:14.480 --> 23:15.437
sexual assault.

23:15.481 --> 23:16.917
- I didn't do
any of these things.

23:16.960 --> 23:18.440
Look, they're lying.

23:18.484 --> 23:21.356
I don't know why they're lying,
but they are lying,

23:21.400 --> 23:22.531
and you need to help me.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.881
- I'm sorry.
Call your lawyer

23:24.925 --> 23:26.840
and have her meet you
at Central Booking.

23:33.847 --> 23:35.631
[indistinct chatter
and shouting]

23:35.675 --> 23:38.025
- Luna, Luna, over here!

23:38.068 --> 23:40.767
- I-I can't.
- Keep your head down.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.464
- Lun, did you do it?
Are you guilty?

23:42.508 --> 23:44.466
- Betrayed all women, rapist!
- Hold her back.

23:44.510 --> 23:46.642
Hold her back.
Let us through.

23:46.686 --> 23:49.645
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

23:49.689 --> 23:52.518
- Ms. Prasada,
how do you plead?

23:52.561 --> 23:54.868
- Well, I didn't do
any of this.

23:54.911 --> 23:55.999
- Not guilty, Your Honor.

23:56.043 --> 23:57.174
- People on bail?

23:57.218 --> 23:58.654
- Remand.

23:58.698 --> 24:00.395
The defendant
has unlimited resources,

24:00.439 --> 24:01.614
access to a private jet--

24:01.657 --> 24:02.919
- She's not going anywhere.

24:02.963 --> 24:05.444
She wants to fight
these ridiculous charges.

24:05.487 --> 24:07.837
- This court takes
sexual assault very seriously.

24:07.881 --> 24:09.099
- So does my client.

24:09.143 --> 24:10.187
- Bail is denied.

24:10.231 --> 24:11.754
Ms. Prasada is remanded
pending trial.

24:11.798 --> 24:12.886
- You'll be fine.

24:12.929 --> 24:16.585
- No, you--you can't
do this to me.

24:16.629 --> 24:18.065
There has been a--

24:18.108 --> 24:19.109
- It's okay.

24:19.153 --> 24:21.721
- There has been
a horrible mistake.

24:21.764 --> 24:23.679
Now, I haven't done
any of these things, get--

24:23.723 --> 24:25.115
No, no, no,
get your hands off of me.

24:25.159 --> 24:26.552
- Get her out
of my courtroom now.

24:26.595 --> 24:27.857
- Get your hands off of me!

24:27.901 --> 24:29.032
- Get her out of my courtroom.

24:29.076 --> 24:30.991
- This is not--

24:31.034 --> 24:34.124
oh, no, this is not justice.
This is insanity!

24:34.168 --> 24:35.691
- Let us through.
Let us through.

24:35.735 --> 24:36.692
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

24:36.736 --> 24:40.522
Come on.

24:40.566 --> 24:41.784
- When they turn, they turn.

24:41.828 --> 24:44.221
- Also known as
"the harder they fall."

24:44.265 --> 24:46.746
- Oh, the press and the public
cannot get enough

24:46.789 --> 24:47.921
of her humiliation.

24:49.575 --> 24:52.491
I've seen male serial predators
get more respect than this.

24:52.534 --> 24:54.667
- Yeah, quite a dramatic crash
from a week ago.

24:54.710 --> 24:57.060
- What I don't get--why make
a false rape accusation

24:57.104 --> 24:58.714
with so much to hide?

24:58.758 --> 25:00.194
It's like she was asking
to get caught.

25:00.237 --> 25:03.589
- I'm not sure that
that accusation is false.

25:03.632 --> 25:06.635
I don't know,
but, to be honest...

25:08.289 --> 25:10.247
None of this makes
sense to me.

25:10.291 --> 25:12.032
- Effective immediately,

25:12.075 --> 25:16.558
Luna Prasada has been removed
as CEO of We-B-Well.

25:16.602 --> 25:19.735
I will be taking over
as acting CEO.

25:19.779 --> 25:24.566
Our public can rest assured
it is business as usual.

25:24.610 --> 25:27.917
Bobby Frost, our CFO,
has a few words.

25:27.961 --> 25:29.702
- In her attempt
to avoid the charges,

25:29.745 --> 25:33.575
Luna made completely unfounded
allegations against me.

25:33.619 --> 25:36.578
Nevertheless,
I will fight tooth and nail

25:36.622 --> 25:38.580
to save the company
she started.

25:38.624 --> 25:39.581
[phone vibrates]

25:39.625 --> 25:41.757
- He didn't waste any time.

25:41.801 --> 25:45.761
- From Luna's lawyer, Miglani.
Luna wants to talk.

25:49.635 --> 25:53.769
- The other inmates
held me down,

25:53.813 --> 25:57.120
and I heard somebody say,

25:57.164 --> 26:00.776
"Oh, yeah, she needs to know
what it's like

26:00.820 --> 26:03.605
to be raped by another woman."

26:03.649 --> 26:07.566
- Oh, Luna, I am--
I am so sorry.

26:08.828 --> 26:12.614
- The thing is,
she was probably right.

26:12.658 --> 26:15.095
I mean, I must be guilty

26:15.138 --> 26:17.663
'cause there is
no other explanation.

26:20.230 --> 26:21.971
- Your client wants
to change her plea?

26:22.015 --> 26:24.800
- Against my advice.

26:24.844 --> 26:27.629
- I can't go through the trial.

26:27.673 --> 26:29.544
I just want this to be over.

26:30.850 --> 26:32.982
- Are you saying

26:33.026 --> 26:36.856
that you did embezzle
from We-B-Well?

26:38.335 --> 26:42.644
That you did assault Tisa Chee?

26:42.688 --> 26:47.257
- I'm saying
that I can't remember.

26:49.042 --> 26:51.653
At first I thought, "Oh, oh,
they're setting me up.

26:51.697 --> 26:53.655
Someone's gotta be
setting me up."

26:53.699 --> 26:56.571
I read your emails.
I read the documents.

26:56.615 --> 26:59.226
It sounds like me.
It's got to be me.

27:01.707 --> 27:06.102
- Ms. Prasada, if you're gonna
change your plea to guilty,

27:06.146 --> 27:07.756
you have to admit your guilt.

27:07.800 --> 27:11.673
- So I've got to swear
to crimes

27:11.717 --> 27:14.763
that I don't remember

27:14.807 --> 27:18.637
or I have no awareness of?

27:24.730 --> 27:26.688
Oh, my God.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.259
Have I lost my mind?

27:36.002 --> 27:37.873
[sobs]

27:37.917 --> 27:39.353
I gotta be crazy!

27:39.396 --> 27:41.703
I mean, that's the only thing
that makes any sense!

27:41.747 --> 27:44.619
[laughing]

27:47.100 --> 27:48.405
[shrieks]

27:48.449 --> 27:50.364
[laughs]

27:50.407 --> 27:52.714
Oh, I mean,
as a woman, you know,

27:52.758 --> 27:55.804
I always thought,
"I've gotta be strong.

27:55.848 --> 27:59.242
"I'm--I can--I can get
on top of things.

27:59.286 --> 28:03.246
I can take control of things,
'cause I'm a woman!"

28:03.290 --> 28:04.421
You know?

28:04.465 --> 28:07.076
I've always been
about empowering women.

28:07.120 --> 28:09.731
Women--because
we can overcome things.

28:09.775 --> 28:12.908
We can overcome anything.
We can.

28:12.952 --> 28:15.781
We're women, okay?
We're women!

28:18.740 --> 28:20.786
[whispers]
I can't overcome this.

28:23.223 --> 28:26.835
I feel like
I've been betrayed by my mind.

28:28.054 --> 28:31.884
I'm going insane.
I think I'm going insane!

28:31.927 --> 28:33.886
- All right,
she needs to see a doctor.

28:33.929 --> 28:36.453
- And a psychiatrist.
- [laughs]

28:36.497 --> 28:38.281
- Come with me.
Okay, come with me.

28:38.325 --> 28:40.022
- [laughs]
Okay, okay.

28:40.066 --> 28:41.023
- Okay.

28:41.067 --> 28:43.112
- [laughing]

28:43.156 --> 28:46.159
Honestly, my mind--

28:46.202 --> 28:49.118
I don't wanna lose my mind!

28:49.162 --> 28:50.816
Oh, my God!

28:50.859 --> 28:52.469
- What, is she trying
for a psych defense?

28:52.513 --> 28:53.819
- I think she's trying
to figure out

28:53.862 --> 28:55.821
what the hell is going on here.

28:57.170 --> 29:00.303
She spent her entire career
empowering women,

29:00.347 --> 29:04.133
and now she just falls apart?

29:04.177 --> 29:06.309
Look, either she's got
a split personality...

29:06.353 --> 29:07.746
- That's not likely.

29:07.789 --> 29:10.966
- Or her employees
are framing her,

29:11.010 --> 29:14.709
and she's having a breakdown
because she's being gaslighted.

29:21.585 --> 29:21.760
.

29:21.803 --> 29:24.675
- Captain, how's Luna doing?

29:24.719 --> 29:27.200
- Still under observation
in the psych ward.

29:27.243 --> 29:28.723
Did you find anything?

29:28.767 --> 29:31.421
- Not a slam dunk,
but your conspiracy theory--

29:31.465 --> 29:33.423
there might be something there.

29:33.467 --> 29:35.469
Sequoia confirmed
that she and Luna

29:35.512 --> 29:37.210
spent every night
in Lake George

29:37.253 --> 29:39.778
in a hotel suite,
not the cabin.

29:39.821 --> 29:42.476
- Oh, that doesn't track
with Tisa Chee's story.

29:42.519 --> 29:45.348
- Nope, so I checked
Tisa and Luna's phone records.

29:46.523 --> 29:48.830
No texts or calls
between them that week,

29:48.874 --> 29:51.790
but I did find
multiple late night calls

29:51.833 --> 29:54.531
between Tisa and Vinay Gupta,
the chief tech officer,

29:54.575 --> 29:56.664
going back six months.
- Late night.

29:56.707 --> 29:57.970
Maybe they're having an affair.

29:58.013 --> 30:00.450
He gets her
to make a false charge.

30:00.494 --> 30:02.670
Rollins, anything
in Luna's emails?

30:02.713 --> 30:04.498
- Maybe.
The account is the same

30:04.541 --> 30:05.716
that Luna uses at work.

30:05.760 --> 30:07.196
The IP address matches, too,

30:07.240 --> 30:08.894
and they sound
like her somewhat.

30:08.937 --> 30:10.243
- Okay, well,
that's her sign off--

30:10.286 --> 30:11.461
"Be well, be hot, be happy."

30:11.505 --> 30:13.855
- But there are phrases

30:13.899 --> 30:17.990
with more aggressive, more male
energy than in Luna's idiolect.

30:18.033 --> 30:19.948
"Keep my powder dry,"

30:19.992 --> 30:22.298
"cut to the chase,"
"red ocean."

30:22.342 --> 30:23.299
- "Red ocean"?

30:23.343 --> 30:24.910
- It's an MBA phrase--

30:24.953 --> 30:27.695
one that's used quite a bit
in Bobby Frost's group emails.

30:27.738 --> 30:29.740
Here's one Bobby sent
in November.

30:31.438 --> 30:34.745
- So Bobby ghosted her emails
and set this whole thing up.

30:34.789 --> 30:36.443
Is that enough
to get the charges dropped?

30:36.486 --> 30:38.010
- [sighs]
If only.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.969
Look, all we have
is an alternate theory.

30:41.013 --> 30:43.232
- One that Hadid
is going to hate.

30:45.278 --> 30:48.498
- Late night phone calls,
phrases in an email,

30:48.542 --> 30:50.936
three company executives
and a staffer

30:50.979 --> 30:54.548
all conspiring
to frame their CEO?

30:54.591 --> 30:56.593
It's insanely elaborate.

30:56.637 --> 30:59.248
- You mean elaborate enough
to drive someone insane.

30:59.292 --> 31:00.902
- That's more likely
than the scenario

31:00.946 --> 31:03.339
that Luna is crazy and guilty?

31:03.383 --> 31:06.255
- Okay, Ms. Hadid,
guilty people--

31:06.299 --> 31:08.649
they mitigate, deny,
they blame others,

31:08.692 --> 31:10.738
but they don't
blame themselves.

31:10.781 --> 31:13.872
They don't think
that they're losing their mind.

31:13.915 --> 31:15.395
- Luna is not faking this.

31:15.438 --> 31:17.571
She had a breakdown
right in front of us.

31:17.614 --> 31:20.269
- Okay, I hear you,

31:20.313 --> 31:22.663
but we're not dropping
the charges against Luna.

31:22.706 --> 31:25.927
In fact, we're moving forward
on the prosecution.

31:25.971 --> 31:27.929
- What?

31:27.973 --> 31:30.062
- Prep all four accusers
for a grand jury.

31:30.105 --> 31:31.715
- Why--so they can
nail down their stories?

31:31.759 --> 31:33.761
Get immunity?
All due respect, Ms. Hadid--

31:33.804 --> 31:36.851
- If they're going to lie,
I want them on record.

31:36.895 --> 31:40.507
Right now, they think they've
gotten away with toppling Luna.

31:40.550 --> 31:43.771
If this is
some sort of conspiracy,

31:43.814 --> 31:45.947
we don't want them to know
we're on to them.

31:48.689 --> 31:50.647
- Fair enough.

31:50.691 --> 31:52.693
Start with the victim Tisa.

31:52.736 --> 31:54.782
There's no way
that she's the mastermind.

31:58.394 --> 32:02.094
- So I sit here,
and you'll ask me questions?

32:02.137 --> 32:04.792
- That's right.
You'll be under oath.

32:04.835 --> 32:09.405
There'll be 23 grand jurors
across from you.

32:09.449 --> 32:13.061
- And your testimony
is vitally important.

32:13.105 --> 32:15.020
You see,
with white collar crimes,

32:15.063 --> 32:16.847
juries--they tend
to glaze over,

32:16.891 --> 32:20.460
but a rape--you have the chance
to put Luna away for years.

32:20.503 --> 32:23.419
- Years?
- She sexually assaulted you.

32:25.030 --> 32:27.597
- Okay, you ready?

32:27.641 --> 32:30.861
All right, Ms. Chee,
on the night of September 27th,

32:30.905 --> 32:33.516
Luna Prasada invited you over
for the evening.

32:33.560 --> 32:35.997
- Yes, I thought
it was gonna be a party,

32:36.041 --> 32:37.694
but it was just her and me.

32:37.738 --> 32:38.826
- And where did you meet her?

32:38.869 --> 32:40.045
- In her cabin.

32:40.088 --> 32:44.397
- In her cabin--are you sure?

32:44.440 --> 32:47.008
- Yes.
Why?

32:47.052 --> 32:50.098
- Hmm.

32:50.142 --> 32:51.578
- There's a minor discrepancy.

32:51.621 --> 32:53.493
- I don't--I don't understand.

32:53.536 --> 32:54.711
- Tisa, it turns out

32:54.755 --> 32:57.366
that Luna never even
checked into a cabin.

32:58.585 --> 33:01.588
Now, is that something
maybe you got wrong?

33:01.631 --> 33:05.592
- No.
- No.

33:05.635 --> 33:08.987
Um, okay, you know,
we'll get back to that.

33:10.205 --> 33:12.599
Now, you said
that she invited you.

33:12.642 --> 33:14.035
Was this from a cell?

33:14.079 --> 33:16.995
- Yes.
- That's strange...

33:18.735 --> 33:22.043
Because we couldn't find
any records of her calling you.

33:22.087 --> 33:25.046
- Wait, um, she texted me.

33:25.090 --> 33:27.396
- Oh, that makes sense.

33:27.440 --> 33:31.574
The thing is,
we also checked your phone.

33:31.618 --> 33:33.185
- And the only text or calls

33:33.228 --> 33:36.536
we found from that night
were from Vinay Gupta.

33:38.016 --> 33:40.018
You and Vinay talk a lot.

33:42.063 --> 33:43.543
- We were co-workers.

33:43.586 --> 33:46.589
- Do you call other coworkers
at 2:00 a.m.?

33:48.113 --> 33:52.117
If you tell this story
to the grand jury,

33:52.160 --> 33:55.903
you'll be looking
at seven years for perjury.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.819
- You're at a crossroads here,
Tisa.

33:58.862 --> 34:01.952
Now, I think
that you're a good person

34:01.996 --> 34:03.911
who maybe got talked
into saying some things

34:03.954 --> 34:05.086
that you knew were wrong.

34:11.875 --> 34:13.747
- That--that's right.

34:13.790 --> 34:17.055
It wasn't my idea.
It was Vinay.

34:17.098 --> 34:18.795
He said
it wouldn't get to trial.

34:18.839 --> 34:20.493
It was just--

34:20.536 --> 34:22.582
Luna was crazy,

34:22.625 --> 34:24.801
and we needed
to save the company.

34:35.551 --> 34:35.943
.

34:35.986 --> 34:39.512
- So Tisa admitted
I never assaulted her?

34:41.209 --> 34:42.515
Well, why would she
make that up?

34:42.558 --> 34:44.647
- Because she was having
an affair with Vinay.

34:44.691 --> 34:46.388
He talked her into it.

34:46.432 --> 34:49.304
He told her that they
had to force you out.

34:49.348 --> 34:52.090
- Why would he do that?
- He's denying all of this.

34:52.133 --> 34:55.310
He said that Tisa came to him,
and he believed her.

34:55.354 --> 34:58.139
- And do you believe him?
- What is going on here?

34:58.183 --> 35:03.013
- We think that Bobby,
Vinay, and Melanie

35:03.057 --> 35:05.407
conspired to frame you

35:05.451 --> 35:08.410
for the embezzlement
and assault.

35:08.454 --> 35:10.499
- So the emails--
I never wrote them?

35:10.543 --> 35:13.198
- No, we believe
that Bobby did.

35:13.241 --> 35:15.635
- We assume it was Vinay
that broke into your accounts,

35:15.678 --> 35:17.158
but we can't prove that.

35:17.202 --> 35:19.334
- Okay, but my passwords

35:19.378 --> 35:20.335
would be very difficult
to hack.

35:20.379 --> 35:21.728
They're very complicated.

35:21.771 --> 35:25.166
- First pet,
street you grew up on?

35:25.210 --> 35:27.603
- Yes, but also
my home phone number

35:27.647 --> 35:30.432
from when I was a kid.
It was unlisted.

35:30.476 --> 35:33.740
Only a...

35:33.783 --> 35:36.656
A few friends knew it.

35:36.699 --> 35:39.615
Pinky.
- Pinky?

35:39.659 --> 35:43.663
Melanie's name--her nickname
from when we were kids.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.404
We used to go
to summer camp together.

35:45.447 --> 35:48.407
- Luna,
you never mentioned that.

35:48.450 --> 35:52.628
- It never--that was
a lifetime ago.

35:52.672 --> 35:56.589
I'm not Lori
from Hackensack anymore.

35:56.632 --> 35:58.199
I evolved.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.288
- But is it possible
that you evolved,

36:00.332 --> 36:02.508
but Melanie didn't?

36:07.165 --> 36:08.818
- Yes, Lori and I--

36:08.862 --> 36:13.301
Luna and I were friends
a long time ago.

36:13.345 --> 36:15.782
That doesn't mean that I hacked
her personal accounts.

36:15.825 --> 36:17.175
You should be talking to Vinay.

36:17.218 --> 36:19.829
- Oh, we talked to him
and his girlfriend, Tisa.

36:19.873 --> 36:22.310
- Tisa's his girlfriend?
He's married.

36:22.354 --> 36:25.095
- Oh, maybe that's why
she gave him up.

36:25.139 --> 36:27.402
Yeah, she didn't wanna go down
for a fake rape accusation

36:27.446 --> 36:28.490
you guys pressured her into.

36:28.534 --> 36:30.318
- I had nothing
to do with that.

36:30.362 --> 36:32.451
- What exactly do you have
on my client?

36:32.494 --> 36:33.800
- She's part of a conspiracy

36:33.843 --> 36:36.411
with Vinay Gupta
and Bobby Frost

36:36.455 --> 36:39.849
to frame Luna for embezzlement
and to rape her.

36:39.893 --> 36:43.418
- No, no, that was
never part of the plan.

36:43.462 --> 36:45.203
- When you help plan a rape,

36:45.246 --> 36:48.684
you're just as guilty
as the rapist.

36:48.728 --> 36:49.816
- [indistinct whispering]

36:49.859 --> 36:52.122
- No, Bobby told me
that never happened,

36:52.166 --> 36:53.298
that Luna was making it up.

36:53.341 --> 36:55.082
- Well, after he saw
the rape kit results,

36:55.125 --> 36:58.128
he told us that it
was consensual sex.

36:58.172 --> 37:00.566
- [sighs]
God damn it.

37:00.609 --> 37:04.787
Bobby--he never got over
her dumping him.

37:04.831 --> 37:08.617
- And you had nothing to do
with this assault?

37:08.661 --> 37:10.228
- No, I swear.

37:10.271 --> 37:13.231
It was all to protect
the company.

37:13.274 --> 37:16.234
We all knew that at some point,

37:16.277 --> 37:18.714
Luna was going to drive us
over a cliff--

37:18.758 --> 37:24.372
with an HR lawsuit, the FDA.
She has no boundaries.

37:24.416 --> 37:27.723
It's all about her
all of the time.

37:27.767 --> 37:29.769
- Have Bobby and Vinay
cooperated yet?

37:31.684 --> 37:34.164
So we get the cheese?

37:34.208 --> 37:35.688
- The whole wheel.
- [chuckles]

37:37.342 --> 37:39.213
- He has to cut you
a deal, but...

37:41.607 --> 37:43.739
If it was up to me...

37:48.353 --> 37:50.920
How could you do
that to another woman?

37:50.964 --> 37:53.749
- Lori?
Luna?

37:53.793 --> 37:56.578
She spent her whole life
doing that to other women.

37:56.622 --> 37:59.320
Growing up,
we didn't have a lot.

37:59.364 --> 38:04.804
One Christmas, my father got me
a gold heart necklace.

38:04.847 --> 38:09.330
I know I shouldn't do it,
but I wore it to summer camp.

38:09.374 --> 38:11.941
Then, one day, it disappeared.

38:11.985 --> 38:15.728
I was wrecked.
I lied to my parents.

38:15.771 --> 38:18.426
I told them
I didn't like it anymore.

38:18.470 --> 38:22.256
The next summer, who shows up
wearing my necklace?

38:23.649 --> 38:26.478
Lori.
I asked her if it was mine.

38:26.521 --> 38:30.351
She denied it,
but then she said

38:30.395 --> 38:32.875
I could borrow it sometimes.

38:32.919 --> 38:35.878
She spent her whole life
doing this--

38:35.922 --> 38:39.229
stealing what is mine,
then acting gracious,

38:39.273 --> 38:43.408
letting me have...
just a little back.

38:43.451 --> 38:45.366
It's a crazy kind
of gaslighting.

38:45.410 --> 38:47.629
- So you gaslighted her
right back.

38:47.673 --> 38:52.765
- We-B-Well was my idea.
I made the business plan.

38:52.808 --> 38:54.723
Luna--

38:54.767 --> 38:59.554
she's gorgeous, charming,

38:59.598 --> 39:01.687
radiant.

39:01.730 --> 39:05.255
I just wanted her to tell me
she was sorry, you know?

39:05.299 --> 39:07.736
I just wanted her
to give me my necklace back.

39:09.912 --> 39:13.307
- So We-B-Well was your idea.

39:13.351 --> 39:16.354
Now whose idea was it to take
the company away from Luna?

39:18.791 --> 39:21.837
- Luna was the problem.
Removing her was the action.

39:21.881 --> 39:24.013
Success is the result.

39:24.057 --> 39:26.407
PAR--
it is a calm, blue ocean now--

39:26.451 --> 39:27.887
- Bobby Frost,
you're under arrest.

39:27.930 --> 39:29.367
- Oh, come on.

39:29.410 --> 39:30.977
- For conspiracy,
filing a false report,

39:31.020 --> 39:32.674
and rape.
Hands behind your back.

39:32.718 --> 39:33.849
- Hey, slow your roll.

39:33.893 --> 39:34.894
- Get your hands
behind your back!

39:34.937 --> 39:36.852
- I'm calling my lawyer.
- Yeah?

39:36.896 --> 39:38.027
Keep your powder dry.

39:38.071 --> 39:39.638
You can call her
on the way downtown.

39:39.681 --> 39:41.857
- Let's go.

39:43.859 --> 39:46.427
- So Bobby took a plea.

39:46.471 --> 39:50.649
He'll do at least seven years,
and Vinay does five.

39:50.692 --> 39:52.738
- Whew.

39:54.783 --> 39:56.785
And my old friend Melanie?

39:58.091 --> 39:59.701
- There was no case
without her.

39:59.745 --> 40:01.921
- [sighs]

40:01.964 --> 40:03.923
So she walks.

40:08.841 --> 40:10.756
Was it just about the money?

40:10.799 --> 40:13.411
- For the men, yes.

40:14.934 --> 40:17.937
But for her...

40:20.505 --> 40:22.332
- I could've been
a better friend.

40:24.770 --> 40:26.902
I've been thinking about it.

40:29.775 --> 40:33.779
When you arrested me,
I thought it was karma.

40:35.433 --> 40:38.044
I burned a lot of bridges
in my time.

40:41.003 --> 40:46.444
Hell, I...burned
my whole house down.

40:46.487 --> 40:49.316
- Well, you know what happens
when your house burns down?

40:51.840 --> 40:54.669
You get a clear view
of the sky.

40:58.630 --> 41:01.067
- You mind if I steal that?
