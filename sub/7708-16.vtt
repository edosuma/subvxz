00:02.770 --> 00:04.236
Hi.

00:04.238 --> 00:07.106
Hi, Lynnie.
How's the painting coming?

00:07.108 --> 00:08.874
Be honest.

00:08.876 --> 00:10.843
What do you think?

00:12.313 --> 00:15.147
Sorry, babe.
It doesn't speak to me.

00:15.149 --> 00:16.448
Next.

00:17.151 --> 00:18.884
I, I think it's very nice.

00:18.886 --> 00:21.787
It looks good enough to eat.

00:21.789 --> 00:24.423
So you didn't get
the conflicting disharmony

00:24.425 --> 00:26.792
Between man and nature?

00:28.329 --> 00:30.796
[chuckles]
I have to be honest, Lynne.

00:30.798 --> 00:33.932
Uh, I'm afraid all I see
is a very happy pear.

00:35.569 --> 00:38.003
Lynne, a word to the wise.

00:38.005 --> 00:39.171
Forget art.

00:39.173 --> 00:40.806
Stick with plan A.

00:40.808 --> 00:43.142
Throw yourself
at the first rich man

00:43.144 --> 00:45.444
to come along.

00:45.446 --> 00:48.313
No. This class
means a lot to me.

00:48.315 --> 00:51.917
It's being taught by a very
respected artist in residence.

00:51.919 --> 00:54.520
What, he couldn't
afford a place of his own?

00:55.623 --> 00:58.924
- It means that he's--
- I know what it means.

00:58.926 --> 01:01.226
You know, I happen to
have a nodding acquaintance

01:01.228 --> 01:02.961
with painting myself.

01:02.963 --> 01:05.531
I've seen you
paint yourself many times.

01:07.034 --> 01:09.601
Go ahead, mock me.

01:09.603 --> 01:12.504
But I was quite the artist
in my time.

01:12.506 --> 01:15.374
I could paint
any canvas any color

01:15.376 --> 01:17.443
For $29.95.

01:17.445 --> 01:20.446
No ups, no extras.

01:20.448 --> 01:22.648
You know, I just had a thought.

01:22.650 --> 01:25.384
Perhaps if you were to
rekindle your interest in art

01:25.386 --> 01:28.220
it might be a less
destructive and costly way

01:28.222 --> 01:31.557
for you to spend
your idle hours.

01:31.559 --> 01:35.761
You know, the ones between
waking up and falling asleep.

01:35.763 --> 01:37.796
Oh, ha-ha.

01:37.798 --> 01:40.065
Courtesy laugh.

01:40.067 --> 01:43.469
Willie, I accept your offer.

01:43.471 --> 01:46.638
So, Kate, ever done
any nude modeling?

01:49.477 --> 01:51.543
Talk about
a conflicting disharmony

01:51.545 --> 01:53.812
between man and nature.

01:53.814 --> 01:55.347
Oh!

01:56.150 --> 01:59.351

02:26.347 --> 02:29.548

<i> [Ride Of The Valkyries]</i>

03:12.560 --> 03:14.426
Oh, I'm worthless!

03:14.428 --> 03:15.661
I'm nothing!

03:15.663 --> 03:18.263
I'm a disappointment
to my parents.

03:18.265 --> 03:20.432
Willie, spit on me.

03:21.535 --> 03:23.569
I just took an antihistamine.

03:23.571 --> 03:25.404
Otherwise..

03:27.141 --> 03:28.707
What are you doing, anyway?

03:28.709 --> 03:31.944
I'm suffering for my art.

03:31.946 --> 03:35.013
Is it necessary that
we all suffer along with you?

03:36.483 --> 03:38.817
Well, I need inspiration.

03:38.819 --> 03:42.354
I'm thinking about
cutting something off.

03:42.356 --> 03:45.023
May I make a suggestion?

03:45.025 --> 03:47.492
Oh, I knew a mere
civil servant like you

03:47.494 --> 03:49.494
wouldn't understand.

03:49.496 --> 03:53.832
I, on the other hand, have to
make a statement with my life.

03:53.834 --> 03:56.835
And you plan to do
it with peanut butter?

03:56.837 --> 04:00.172
Yeah. It was one of those
happy accidents.

04:00.174 --> 04:03.609
I've also done some
interesting things with pasta.

04:04.378 --> 04:05.777
You wanna buy it?

04:05.779 --> 04:07.379
$39.95.

04:07.381 --> 04:10.282
No ups, no extras.

04:10.284 --> 04:13.852
I'm afraid it'd be wasted
on a mere civil servant like me.

04:14.321 --> 04:15.954
Remember?

04:15.956 --> 04:18.457
I like a man
who knows his place.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.193
Goodnight, ALF.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.663
Let's see.

04:24.665 --> 04:26.999
Maybe I need to
torture myself some more.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.201
But how?

04:29.203 --> 04:31.470
They won't let me have matches.

04:34.241 --> 04:36.675
Aah. Ow! Ow! Ow!
Ow! Ow! Ow!

04:36.677 --> 04:38.510
Ok, I'll paint! I'll paint!

04:38.512 --> 04:41.146
Just let go!

04:41.148 --> 04:42.481
Yeah, yeah.

04:42.483 --> 04:43.882
Better.

[humming]

04:57.164 --> 04:58.797
Stop it!

05:00.367 --> 05:01.700
I'm sorry.

05:01.702 --> 05:03.935
I didn't get
any sleep last night.

05:05.039 --> 05:06.872
Nobody did.

05:06.874 --> 05:08.307
Who would've thought
that ALF could

05:08.309 --> 05:11.610
whistle Wagner for eight hours?

05:11.612 --> 05:14.813
Especially considering
he's got no lips.

05:16.750 --> 05:18.216
Good morning, Tanners!

05:18.218 --> 05:20.485
Isn't it a beautiful day?

05:20.487 --> 05:23.155
Not after what you
put us through, no.

05:23.157 --> 05:24.890
Do you want pancakes or not?

05:24.892 --> 05:27.526
No, thanks. I'm done suffering.

05:28.228 --> 05:30.929
Besides, I finished my..

05:30.931 --> 05:32.964
...masterpiece.

05:32.966 --> 05:35.600
Masterpiece?

05:35.602 --> 05:37.636
Everybody, it's time
for the unveiling.

05:37.638 --> 05:38.870
Step into the gallery.

05:38.872 --> 05:40.706
Stay behind the velvet ropes.

05:40.708 --> 05:42.341
No flash photography.

05:42.343 --> 05:45.143
Check your guns at the door.

05:45.145 --> 05:46.545
Come on.

05:46.547 --> 05:48.714
Let's get this over with.

05:52.619 --> 05:54.286
Okay, okay.

05:54.288 --> 05:58.123
First I'll start with
a biography of the artist.

05:58.125 --> 05:59.891
He was just 17.

05:59.893 --> 06:01.460
You know what I mean.

06:01.462 --> 06:02.794
And the way he looked

06:02.796 --> 06:05.130
is way beyond compare.

06:05.132 --> 06:07.799
ALF, just uncover
the damn thing.

06:09.103 --> 06:10.135
Fine, fine.

06:10.137 --> 06:13.071
Americans rush,
rush, rush, rush, rush.

06:13.073 --> 06:15.140
Huh!

06:15.142 --> 06:16.842
Ta-da!

06:18.145 --> 06:20.345
Looks like something
I saw at traffic school.

06:21.682 --> 06:25.283
Thank you, Kate.
I was worried you'd ridicule it.

06:25.285 --> 06:27.886
So, Lynne, don't you think
your art teacher

06:27.888 --> 06:30.322
would want the privilege
of seeing it?

06:30.324 --> 06:33.024
Hint, hint, hint.

06:33.026 --> 06:36.128
Sorry, babe.
It doesn't speak to me.

06:36.130 --> 06:38.930
But your teacher's
a famous artist.

06:38.932 --> 06:40.532
Let him judge my work.

06:40.534 --> 06:42.367
- Nope.
- Why not?

06:42.369 --> 06:44.703
Because you're not in his class.

06:44.705 --> 06:47.205
But this could be my big break!

06:47.207 --> 06:50.842
My one-way ticket
out of here, forever.

06:50.844 --> 06:53.145
Take the painting.
I know it's a long shot.

06:53.147 --> 06:54.646
Mom!

06:54.648 --> 06:57.849
[sighs]
I can dream, can't I?

06:57.851 --> 07:00.519
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've only got a couple of hours

07:00.521 --> 07:04.322
to make my pear cry out
for the loss of humanity.

07:06.293 --> 07:07.692
You know her problem?

07:07.694 --> 07:09.594
She doesn't have
a tortured soul.

07:09.596 --> 07:12.264
[scoffs]
She can have mine.

07:13.767 --> 07:16.601
What does she mean?
What does she mean?

07:16.603 --> 07:18.570
Huh?

07:18.572 --> 07:21.773
[instrumental music]

07:24.211 --> 07:25.911
Very good.

07:27.815 --> 07:29.047
- Mr. Reuben?
- Mm-hmm.

07:29.049 --> 07:30.649
Do you think
I'm making a proper use

07:30.651 --> 07:32.317
of negative space here?

07:32.319 --> 07:35.954
I'm trying for a primitive,
brooding sensibility.

07:35.956 --> 07:39.024
Another art major.
Somebody call security.

07:40.327 --> 07:42.327
Wally, you're doing fine.

07:43.630 --> 07:45.430
A-ha, a nude.

07:45.432 --> 07:48.033
Jeff, Jeff, Jeff,
you quiet little thing you.

07:48.035 --> 07:50.635
I don't have to
worry about you anymore.

07:50.637 --> 07:52.204
Very attractive.

07:52.206 --> 07:54.239
Thank you.

07:55.442 --> 07:57.375
Well..

07:57.377 --> 07:59.010
You two..

07:59.012 --> 08:01.346
Well, I like to think
I brought you lugs together.

08:04.985 --> 08:06.785
Mm-hmm.

08:08.856 --> 08:11.423
- Hi, Lynne.
- Hi, Mr. Reuben.

08:11.425 --> 08:14.125
You keep a neat work area.

08:14.127 --> 08:14.993
Thank you.

08:14.995 --> 08:16.261
Do you perchance have

08:16.263 --> 08:17.829
anything to show me?

08:17.831 --> 08:19.097
I make it a point never to

08:19.099 --> 08:22.334
follow children or nudes.

08:22.336 --> 08:23.702
Oh, Lynne.

08:23.704 --> 08:25.003
[sighs]

08:25.005 --> 08:27.072
Let's have a look-see.

08:28.041 --> 08:30.308
[gasps]
Mr. Reuben, I can explain!

08:30.310 --> 08:32.410
Well, not without stretching
reality, but I can. See--

08:32.412 --> 08:34.446
Class, class..

08:34.448 --> 08:35.814
Oh, no.

08:35.816 --> 08:38.083
I want you to see something.

08:43.557 --> 08:45.624
What do you think?

08:45.626 --> 08:48.126
- I'll tell you what you think.
- In my defense, Mr. Reuben.

08:48.128 --> 08:50.328
I think I should tell you
this is a mistake.

08:50.330 --> 08:52.998
No, no, no, Lynne.
There are no mistakes.

08:53.000 --> 08:54.766
I am seeing a side of you

08:54.768 --> 08:57.502
that I have never seen before.

08:57.504 --> 08:58.937
And it's brave.

08:58.939 --> 09:02.207
Raw, but inspired.

09:02.209 --> 09:04.409
Very good work.

09:04.411 --> 09:06.111
Actually, uh

09:06.113 --> 09:10.749
I was a little
more fond of, of this.

09:10.751 --> 09:11.883
Ah.

09:11.885 --> 09:13.084
(all)
Ah.

09:13.086 --> 09:14.586
- Nah.
- Nah.

09:14.588 --> 09:17.355
No, that we put
in a model home in the Valley.

09:17.357 --> 09:22.694
But this? This speaks
from your soul.

09:22.696 --> 09:25.564
Is this spinach fettuccine?

09:25.566 --> 09:27.198
Uh, yes.

09:27.200 --> 09:30.101
Lynne, you've made
great strides here.

09:30.103 --> 09:33.038
You have combined
the stylistic elements

09:33.040 --> 09:35.740
of Pollock, Rauschenberg

09:35.742 --> 09:36.942
Jasper Johns..

09:36.944 --> 09:38.510

[instrumental music]

09:49.222 --> 09:51.156
You are in big trouble, mister.

09:51.158 --> 09:53.858
You've got a lot of
explaining to do.

09:53.860 --> 09:55.160
Oh, Willie, Willie.

09:55.162 --> 09:56.828
You're a constant disappointment

09:56.830 --> 09:59.030
to Kate and me.

09:59.933 --> 10:01.366
Do you know what he did?

10:01.368 --> 10:04.269
He stuffed his painting
in my portfolio

10:04.271 --> 10:06.705
thinking somehow
Mr. Reuben would critique it

10:06.707 --> 10:08.073
before I could find it.

10:08.075 --> 10:11.242
Oh, that was an
awfully stupid plan, ALF.

10:11.244 --> 10:13.478
That's what I thought at first.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.180
It worked. I knew it!

10:15.182 --> 10:16.848
I knew watching
"The Brady Bunch"

10:16.850 --> 10:18.249
wasn't a waste of time!

10:18.251 --> 10:20.819
What did he have to say?
Huh, huh, huh?

10:20.821 --> 10:22.554
Oh, great. The fun part.

10:22.556 --> 10:24.389
Now I get to tell him.

10:24.391 --> 10:26.558
I knew it. He hated it.

10:26.560 --> 10:29.060
Excuse me while I open a vein.

10:29.062 --> 10:31.863
Wait, ALF,
before you make a mess

10:31.865 --> 10:34.366
the truth is he liked it.

10:34.368 --> 10:36.501
He said it was brave

10:36.503 --> 10:39.471
raw, and inspired.

10:39.473 --> 10:41.272
Oh, joy!

10:41.274 --> 10:42.874
Oh, rapture!

10:42.876 --> 10:45.910
My day and a half of
suffering has paid off.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.114
You mean it's possible

10:49.116 --> 10:53.118
that this could
truly be a work of art?

10:53.120 --> 10:56.855
And so the breakdown of
human civilization begins.

10:58.425 --> 11:00.091
This is horrible.

11:00.093 --> 11:02.594
Mr. Reuben thinks I have talent.

11:02.596 --> 11:04.062
What am I going to do?

11:04.064 --> 11:07.098
Oh, how do you get yourself
into these things?

11:07.968 --> 11:09.768
What you did was thoughtless

11:09.770 --> 11:12.237
selfish, and egotistical.

11:14.741 --> 11:16.941
You spend your life raising them

11:16.943 --> 11:19.310
and this is the thanks you get.

11:22.849 --> 11:25.383
<i> [Ride Of The Valkyries]</i>

11:34.928 --> 11:36.828
No, it's wrong.

11:36.830 --> 11:39.064
It's all wrong!

11:40.067 --> 11:43.234
Hey, ALF, I got
the supplies you wanted.

11:43.236 --> 11:45.003
Where have you been?

11:45.005 --> 11:46.771
I can't work like this!

11:46.773 --> 11:48.173
I'm a genius.

11:48.175 --> 11:52.210
I don't have to stand for
this incompetence.

11:52.212 --> 11:54.245
Thanks, guy.

11:54.247 --> 11:56.347
What's going on with you?

11:56.349 --> 11:58.783
Well, Lloyd Reuben
thinks I'm a genius.

11:58.785 --> 12:02.787
And as a genius, I'm entitled
to throw meaningless tantrums

12:02.789 --> 12:04.756
from time to time.

12:04.758 --> 12:06.991
So get used to it!

12:06.993 --> 12:09.094
[softly]
Okay?

12:09.096 --> 12:12.530
[chuckles]
I think I liked you better
as a constant drain.

12:14.301 --> 12:16.000
Hi, dad.

12:16.002 --> 12:19.637
ALF, where did all these
paintings come from?

12:19.639 --> 12:22.373
I had a sudden
burst of inspiration.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.076
I discovered Luther Vandross

12:25.078 --> 12:27.779
Well, boogie down Broadway.

12:27.781 --> 12:29.681
Where am I supposed to work?

12:29.683 --> 12:31.082
Will you stop it!

12:31.084 --> 12:33.384
Will you all just stop it!

12:33.386 --> 12:38.189
Oh! Why was I cursed
with such talent?

12:38.925 --> 12:40.391
[sighs]

12:42.996 --> 12:45.563
Um, at the risk of
being yelled at

12:45.565 --> 12:47.565
don't you think you're
overreacting just a bit?

12:47.567 --> 12:50.401
I mean, just because he liked
your first painting--

12:50.403 --> 12:51.870
Wake up.

12:51.872 --> 12:54.038
Someday, with Lloyd's help

12:54.040 --> 12:55.840
I'm going to be famous!

12:55.842 --> 12:58.276
[laughs]

12:58.278 --> 13:02.981
Oh, I could be right up there
with Gauguin, Picasso

13:02.983 --> 13:04.516
Red Skelton.

13:04.518 --> 13:07.318
We could hang together
and do lunch!

13:07.320 --> 13:10.088
You know those guys
get the best tables.

13:11.258 --> 13:12.323
I don't think
you're gonna be

13:12.325 --> 13:14.626
dining with Gauguin.

13:14.628 --> 13:18.229
Maybe not at first,
but you'll see.

13:18.231 --> 13:21.332
People will be dropping my name
at dinner parties.

13:21.334 --> 13:24.235
And you know what comes
with that kind of fame?

13:24.237 --> 13:26.905
Two weeks
in the Betty Ford Center?

13:26.907 --> 13:29.140
Ancillary rights

13:29.142 --> 13:30.775
greeting cards

13:30.777 --> 13:32.076
coffee mugs.

13:32.078 --> 13:34.512
That's what art is all about!

13:34.514 --> 13:35.713
Ask Garfield

13:35.715 --> 13:38.483
if you can ever
get him on the phone.

13:38.485 --> 13:41.186
As long as you're in it
for all the right reasons.

13:41.188 --> 13:42.487
Now, if you will excuse me

13:42.489 --> 13:45.290
I have my own painting
to work on.

13:45.292 --> 13:49.894
Wait, Lynne. Don't you want
my professional opinion?

13:49.896 --> 13:51.296
I'd rather
poke myself in the eye

13:51.298 --> 13:53.765
with a sharp stick.

13:53.767 --> 13:55.533
Lack of confidence.

13:55.535 --> 13:57.569
Not a good sign.

14:05.045 --> 14:09.214
[groans]
P.U! Stinkaroni.

14:09.216 --> 14:11.583
Set off a smoke detector,
why don't ya?

14:11.585 --> 14:12.917
- Dad!
- ALF!

14:12.919 --> 14:16.187
Lynne's been working very hard
on that painting.

14:16.189 --> 14:18.256
Haven't you ever
heard the expression

14:18.258 --> 14:20.458
"beating a dead horse"?

14:20.460 --> 14:22.260
[laughs]

14:22.262 --> 14:25.430
[instrumental music]

14:27.100 --> 14:28.733
Alright, now, before we adjourn

14:28.735 --> 14:30.368
who had a chance
to read the review

14:30.370 --> 14:32.637
of my gallery opening downtown?

14:33.974 --> 14:35.940
I just happen to have a copy.

14:35.942 --> 14:37.942
Who wants to read?

14:37.944 --> 14:39.477
Ellen.

14:39.479 --> 14:40.712
[clears throat]

14:40.714 --> 14:43.414
"With his current show,
Mr. Reuben has superbly shown

14:43.416 --> 14:45.783
"the otherwise tame
Los Angeles art scene

14:45.785 --> 14:48.820
"that neoclassicism is still
a valid and innovative form

14:48.822 --> 14:50.488
of two-dimensional expression."

14:50.490 --> 14:51.623
Oh!

14:51.625 --> 14:52.757
[applause]

14:52.759 --> 14:54.225
Well, thank you, thank you.

14:54.227 --> 14:55.226
You know, if it had
come from me

14:55.228 --> 14:56.594
it would have been boasting.

14:56.596 --> 14:57.996
And, by the way, did I mention

14:57.998 --> 14:59.564
that if you buy anything
for $2,000 or more

14:59.566 --> 15:02.000
you don't have to
take the final?

15:02.002 --> 15:04.502
Alright, I'll see you
next week.

15:04.504 --> 15:07.772
Say, Ellen, do you plan on
doing anymore posing?

15:12.612 --> 15:15.380
Lynne, you had any
new breakthroughs this week?

15:15.382 --> 15:18.182
Well, it may not be
as brave and raw

15:18.184 --> 15:19.417
as the last assignment

15:19.419 --> 15:22.453
but it won't go stale, either.

15:22.455 --> 15:25.223
Well.. It's, it's different.

15:25.225 --> 15:27.158
It's just as valid.

15:27.160 --> 15:31.029
Just as interpretive
in its own way.

15:31.031 --> 15:33.598
You know, Lynne, once you
find your artistic voice

15:33.600 --> 15:35.900
there's going to be
no shutting you up.

15:35.902 --> 15:37.735
And that's good, right?

15:37.737 --> 15:40.204
I think we should talk
about this over coffee.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.539
In fact, we could
catch a gallery opening.

15:41.541 --> 15:42.774
I hear mine's pretty good.

15:42.776 --> 15:45.410
- In all modesty.
- So it's a date.

15:45.412 --> 15:47.779
In fact, there's
a great piano bar next door.

15:47.781 --> 15:49.981
Sometimes Mel Torme
drops in and does a set.

15:49.983 --> 15:51.482
Uh, Mr. Reuben

15:51.484 --> 15:53.518
I'm flattered, very, but--

15:53.520 --> 15:55.053
Oh, wait a minute.
I-I'm going too fast.

15:55.055 --> 15:56.254
Uh, forget the Mel thing.

15:56.256 --> 15:57.288
I-I forgot what age bracket

15:57.290 --> 15:59.057
I was hitting on.

15:59.059 --> 16:01.960
You neoclassicists
are all alike.

16:01.962 --> 16:03.795
Mr. Reuben..

16:03.797 --> 16:08.299
All that stuff you said
about brave and inspired?

16:08.301 --> 16:13.137
Were you just saying that,
or do you really like my work?

16:13.139 --> 16:17.475
Well...like is..

16:17.477 --> 16:20.044
...is such a subjective term.

16:20.046 --> 16:21.612
I mean, art is art.

16:21.614 --> 16:23.581
You know, there's no good,
there's no bad.

16:23.583 --> 16:25.350
But you do have an opinion.

16:25.352 --> 16:27.452
My opinion shouldn't matter.

16:27.454 --> 16:30.521
- But you're the teacher.
- But I'm not a good one.

16:30.523 --> 16:33.191
I thought you said
there was no good or bad.

16:34.394 --> 16:35.693
You just complimented me

16:35.695 --> 16:37.462
because you wanted to
go out with me.

16:37.464 --> 16:41.332
I-I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Let's start all over again.

16:41.334 --> 16:43.868
I don't like your work.

16:43.870 --> 16:45.503
Will you go out with me?

16:45.505 --> 16:47.105
No.

16:47.107 --> 16:49.374
You don't like me?

16:49.376 --> 16:52.243
Like is such a subjective term.

16:56.016 --> 16:59.283
[instrumental music]

17:06.292 --> 17:07.892
Hey, what's going on?

17:07.894 --> 17:10.928
How come all your paintings
are stacked up in here?

17:10.930 --> 17:14.499
I'm getting ready for
my first retrospective.

17:14.501 --> 17:17.368
"ALF, The Early Weeks."

17:18.304 --> 17:19.637
Just get them all out of here

17:19.639 --> 17:21.939
before they start to draw ants.

17:23.610 --> 17:25.376
Hi, guys!

17:25.378 --> 17:27.678
ALF, I have
something to tell you

17:27.680 --> 17:30.581
that you might find
very interesting.

17:31.084 --> 17:32.350
Good news?

17:32.352 --> 17:34.919
It is to me. Ha!

17:34.921 --> 17:38.856
Uh-oh. I detect
a stage-three smug alert.

17:40.226 --> 17:42.693
Well, I'm trying to be
big about this

17:42.695 --> 17:45.630
But it's just so darn hard.

17:45.632 --> 17:48.332
Lynne, it's not
nice to be petty.

17:48.334 --> 17:50.568
I'm sorry, dad.

17:50.570 --> 17:54.005
¶ Guess whose career
is in the toilet ¶

17:54.007 --> 17:56.674
Much better.

17:56.676 --> 18:00.478
Today in class, Mr. Reuben said
he liked my latest work.

18:00.480 --> 18:04.348
Oh, finally, something
that makes sense on some level.

18:04.350 --> 18:06.551
Wait, dad. It gets even better.

18:06.553 --> 18:08.219
It turns out he only said it

18:08.221 --> 18:11.055
because he thought
I'd go out with him.

18:11.057 --> 18:13.091
So he lied to you?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.826
[chuckles]
For a second there

18:14.828 --> 18:18.196
I was starting to
lose respect for the guy.

18:18.198 --> 18:20.665
So what are you going to wear?

18:20.667 --> 18:23.668
As usual, you're not listening.

18:23.670 --> 18:26.370
Mr. Reuben
never liked your work.

18:26.372 --> 18:28.906
Yours<i> or</i> mine.
Sinking in yet?

18:31.044 --> 18:33.978
So you're saying
this affects me.

18:33.980 --> 18:36.447
Yes! I'm sorry, ALF.

18:36.449 --> 18:37.882
But you're going to
have to forget about

18:37.884 --> 18:40.518
the greeting cards,
the coffee mugs

18:40.520 --> 18:43.321
and the dinners with Gauguin.

18:43.323 --> 18:44.388
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

18:44.390 --> 18:47.091
Lynne, we could still save this!

18:47.093 --> 18:48.493
Go out with him!

18:48.495 --> 18:52.263
I'm not above
trading on your good looks.

18:52.265 --> 18:54.198
That is absolutely insulting.

18:54.200 --> 18:56.667
Anyway, I already
transferred into another class.

18:56.669 --> 18:59.437
Well, no! Go back! Please?

18:59.439 --> 19:02.173
Please, please,
please, please, please?

19:02.175 --> 19:03.441
Well..

19:03.443 --> 19:05.276
- Oh!
- That's it.

19:05.278 --> 19:06.444
It's over.

19:06.446 --> 19:08.546
I can't believe it.

19:08.548 --> 19:11.215
My life no longer has meaning.

19:11.217 --> 19:14.685
Everything back to normal.

19:14.687 --> 19:17.588
Well, you wanna split a soda?

19:17.590 --> 19:19.223
- Okay.
- Hmm. Popcorn?

19:19.225 --> 19:20.324
Thanks.

19:20.326 --> 19:22.527
[instrumental music]

19:22.529 --> 19:25.062
My life is over.

19:25.064 --> 19:28.666
Why? Why? Why? Why? Why?

19:29.869 --> 19:31.035
ALF?

19:31.037 --> 19:32.303
Yeah, what?

19:32.305 --> 19:34.305
Can I come in?

19:34.307 --> 19:36.874
Suit yourself.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.011
I noticed you didn't
come to dinner.

19:40.013 --> 19:42.046
You okay?

19:42.048 --> 19:45.917
Food only reminds me
of my shattered career.

19:45.919 --> 19:50.121
Besides...I've been
snacking off my early works.

19:51.224 --> 19:52.657
I just wanted you to know

19:52.659 --> 19:54.525
that I guess I could've told you

19:54.527 --> 19:56.561
in a more diplomatic way.

19:56.563 --> 19:58.996
It's just that
you were so obnoxious.

19:59.966 --> 20:01.165
Yeah.

20:01.167 --> 20:03.134
I'm going to miss those days.

20:03.136 --> 20:04.735
[chuckles]
They'll be back.

20:04.737 --> 20:07.838
We're just
enjoying the breather.

20:07.840 --> 20:10.808
Hey, when did you
start the fresco?

20:10.810 --> 20:14.412
Oh, now you're gonna tell me
you like it out of pity.

20:14.414 --> 20:17.381
I resent that. Take it back.

20:17.383 --> 20:19.617
Well, if it helps any

20:19.619 --> 20:22.486
I really don't care for it
all that much.

20:23.289 --> 20:25.590
Don't patronize me.

20:25.592 --> 20:28.526
ALF, what do you want?

20:28.528 --> 20:30.561
Well, if you weren't
such a priss

20:30.563 --> 20:32.863
I'd have a career by now!

20:32.865 --> 20:36.534
[sighs]
Just because art doesn't
bring you money and fame

20:36.536 --> 20:38.469
it's no reason to quit.

20:38.471 --> 20:39.770
A lot of great artists

20:39.772 --> 20:41.973
never lived to see
their own success.

20:42.709 --> 20:45.643
Then what's the point?

20:45.645 --> 20:49.013
The point is,
if you like to paint, paint.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.048
Oh, yeah, sure.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.951
What the world needs
is more mediocrity.

20:53.953 --> 20:57.388
Isn't first-run
syndication enough?

20:57.390 --> 21:00.725
Granted your art
may be mediocre..

21:00.727 --> 21:03.127
- Hey!
- See? You do care.

21:03.129 --> 21:05.196
So why don't you just
go ahead and finish it?

21:05.198 --> 21:06.764
You know, with no expectations

21:06.766 --> 21:10.701
but just for the pure
pleasure of doing it.

21:10.703 --> 21:13.704
So you're saying I should
spend hours on my back

21:13.706 --> 21:16.974
suffering over some
cockamamie fresco

21:16.976 --> 21:20.745
all to gain some
inner satisfaction?

21:20.747 --> 21:23.080
That doesn't
sound very lucrative.

21:23.082 --> 21:24.248
[sighs]

21:24.250 --> 21:26.183
I give up. I tried.

21:26.185 --> 21:28.219
My conscience is clear.

21:29.689 --> 21:31.989
[sighs]
The pain.

21:32.925 --> 21:34.425
What's the use?

21:34.427 --> 21:36.093
Why go on?

21:36.095 --> 21:38.896
It's all kind of empty
without the promise of cash.

21:43.069 --> 21:45.536
[instrumental music]

21:48.975 --> 21:50.841
I can't believe
those cranked out

21:50.843 --> 21:52.576
assembly line paintings of yours

21:52.578 --> 21:54.945
were the only things
that sold at our garage sale.

21:54.947 --> 21:58.849
Like they say, "Give the public
what they want."

21:58.851 --> 22:03.788
Well, they also say,
"There's one born every minute."

22:03.790 --> 22:07.291
And they all seem to live
on our block.

22:07.293 --> 22:08.559
So let's see.

22:08.561 --> 22:09.860
That's 13 paintings

22:09.862 --> 22:13.464
red-tagged to move at $19.95.

22:13.466 --> 22:15.533
No ups, no extras.

22:15.535 --> 22:18.469
That comes to roughly..

22:18.471 --> 22:21.372
...four million!

22:21.374 --> 22:27.578
Try $259.35.

22:27.580 --> 22:30.414
Well, I said roughly.

22:30.416 --> 22:33.150
Boy, you have an attitude.

22:33.152 --> 22:35.619
Chill out.

22:35.621 --> 22:38.823
[instrumental music]

22:43.463 --> 22:46.664
[instrumental music]

23:10.757 --> 23:13.924
[ALF laughing]
