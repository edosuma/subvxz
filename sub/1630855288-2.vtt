00:00.417 --> 00:02.044
Previously on
Cruel Summer...

00:02.044 --> 00:04.046
Megan: Debbie keeps talking like
she's doing me this huge favor,

00:04.046 --> 00:05.547
importing a new
best friend for me.

00:05.547 --> 00:08.300
Guys, everyone.
Hi. This is Isabella.

00:08.300 --> 00:10.260
I'm Jeff. Nice to meet you.

00:12.471 --> 00:14.181
What are you doing?

00:14.181 --> 00:15.515
Are you going through my stuff?

00:15.515 --> 00:16.975
Um...

00:16.975 --> 00:20.020
So, you would be okay
if I hooked up with Luke?

00:20.020 --> 00:22.481
Uh, yeah, no, go for it.

00:22.481 --> 00:24.566
To the best friend
I could ever ask for.

00:24.566 --> 00:26.318
My ultimate ride or die.

00:28.403 --> 00:29.947
I love you.

00:36.078 --> 00:38.372
I love you, too.

00:38.372 --> 00:39.957
(Luke panting on video)

00:42.668 --> 00:44.419
Some best friend you are.

00:44.419 --> 00:45.754
(crying)

00:48.840 --> 00:50.634
None of this would have happened
if she never came into town.

00:51.760 --> 00:54.137
(chatter on police radio)

00:54.137 --> 00:55.597
It's Luke.

00:58.600 --> 01:00.185
We have to get
our stories straight.

01:07.192 --> 01:09.069
(modem beeping)

01:27.087 --> 01:28.463
Isabella: "Dear Lisa,

01:28.463 --> 01:29.798
"hope you're somewhere

01:29.798 --> 01:32.301
"as amazing as you read this.

01:32.301 --> 01:34.011
"People here look at me

01:34.011 --> 01:37.055
"like I'm this exotic creature
from another planet,

01:37.055 --> 01:39.349
"which only makes it
more fun to mess with them.

01:41.435 --> 01:45.063
I think I'm really
gonna like it here."

01:45.063 --> 01:46.815
(Santana playing "Smooth")

01:46.815 --> 01:48.358
"There's just one obstacle."

01:48.358 --> 01:49.526
Hey.

01:49.526 --> 01:50.736
♪ I hear you whisper ♪

01:50.736 --> 01:54.156
♪ And the words
melt everyone ♪

01:54.156 --> 01:56.700
♪ But you stay so cool... ♪

02:04.416 --> 02:05.917
guy:
Come on, come on, come on!

02:05.917 --> 02:07.127
Go, go, go!

02:07.127 --> 02:08.754
(door opens)

02:08.754 --> 02:10.339
(car engine starts)

02:12.049 --> 02:13.925
(car drives off)

02:28.982 --> 02:31.193
(door opens)

02:31.193 --> 02:32.778
(door closes)

02:32.778 --> 02:34.404
(gulls calling in distance)

02:37.824 --> 02:39.993
We've both said things
that we shouldn't have.

02:39.993 --> 02:43.080
But now that they've
found Luke's body...

02:43.080 --> 02:45.707
people are gonna start
asking questions.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.585
So, you can't
shut me out forever.

03:04.351 --> 03:06.853
(electronic squelching)

03:11.066 --> 03:13.151
Okay.

03:13.151 --> 03:14.194
See?

03:15.570 --> 03:17.698
Nothin' to it. You try.

03:17.698 --> 03:20.367
Okay. Let's see.

03:21.910 --> 03:23.995
Oh, my gosh. I'm so sorry.

03:23.995 --> 03:25.497
It's okay.

03:25.497 --> 03:28.375
It takes practice.
Eventually you'll crack it.

03:29.292 --> 03:31.545
In Tunisia they have
this thing called shakshuka.

03:31.545 --> 03:33.547
It's eggs
in a spicy tomato sauce.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.589
It's so good.

03:34.589 --> 03:35.882
Wow.

03:35.882 --> 03:38.009
You've been everywhere.

03:38.009 --> 03:39.636
Do you have friends
all over the world?

03:39.636 --> 03:41.471
Not really.

03:41.471 --> 03:43.432
When I was younger,
we moved around a lot,

03:43.432 --> 03:45.016
so it was kind of hard
to make friends.

03:45.016 --> 03:46.893
Finally went
to boarding school.

03:46.893 --> 03:48.562
Didn't you miss your parents?

03:48.562 --> 03:50.981
Sure, but it wasn't
really that different.

03:50.981 --> 03:52.023
They're always working.

03:52.023 --> 03:53.608
Hmm.

03:53.608 --> 03:54.901
Hey, Lily,

03:54.901 --> 03:56.069
in boarding school,

03:56.069 --> 03:57.070
your friends become

03:57.070 --> 03:58.530
like your family.

03:58.530 --> 03:59.656
At least Lisa did,

03:59.656 --> 04:01.450
and she's my best friend.

04:01.450 --> 04:02.868
What's she like?

04:02.868 --> 04:05.871
Gosh, she is... super fun.

04:05.871 --> 04:08.790
Smart, incredibly ambitious,

04:08.790 --> 04:11.877
super driven, but you know what,
a total control freak, though.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.213
-(giggles)
-Sounds like someone we know.

04:15.213 --> 04:17.340
Except they're not friends.

04:17.340 --> 04:18.967
Lily?

04:18.967 --> 04:20.802
It's okay. It takes time

04:20.802 --> 04:23.513
to get to know someone, right?

04:23.513 --> 04:25.265
Sooner or later, I'll crack it.

04:25.265 --> 04:27.058
(Debbie chuckles)

05:07.140 --> 05:10.310
I just spent an hour trying
to convince Principal Bowers

05:10.310 --> 05:12.437
not to suspend you.

05:12.437 --> 05:13.939
Seriously?

05:13.939 --> 05:16.566
The whole town
saw you having sex.

05:16.566 --> 05:19.611
So, am I... am I suspended?

05:20.737 --> 05:22.364
She agreed to probation.

05:24.366 --> 05:27.369
One false move,
you'll be expelled.

05:28.954 --> 05:30.121
Okay, thanks.

05:31.540 --> 05:33.875
Debbie, I really appreciate it.

05:33.875 --> 05:36.795
Doubt that that's enough to
convince Megan to forgive you,

05:36.795 --> 05:38.672
but I guess
you have to start somewhere.

06:05.198 --> 06:07.742
Isabella. What's up?

06:07.742 --> 06:09.786
Uh, thought you might need this.

06:09.786 --> 06:12.080
Thanks. Yeah, didn't even
realize I left it.

06:12.080 --> 06:14.457
Did you go in my room?

06:14.457 --> 06:16.668
I thought it was
the Chatham way.

06:16.668 --> 06:19.629
Hey, Megan, a large steak
and cheese to go for me, please.

06:19.629 --> 06:21.882
-Yeah.
-Oh, hi.

06:21.882 --> 06:24.676
What is this, Bring Your
Exchange Student to Work Day?

06:24.676 --> 06:28.013
Nope. I am, uh, just
dropping something off.

06:28.013 --> 06:30.015
And leaving.

06:30.015 --> 06:32.017
What are you up to?

06:32.017 --> 06:34.561
Uh, my only plan for today
involves a pool

06:34.561 --> 06:35.979
and some PlayStation.

06:35.979 --> 06:37.856
Nothing like a big,
greasy sub before a swim.

06:37.856 --> 06:39.024
Don't cramp up.

06:39.024 --> 06:41.276
Actually,
four out of five experts say

06:41.276 --> 06:44.613
that a steak and provolone
is the key to a perfect
backstroke, so...

06:44.613 --> 06:47.115
We should test that theory.

06:47.115 --> 06:50.410
Hey, make it a dozen subs,
on me.

06:53.163 --> 06:56.416
What? One sandwich isn't enough
to feed a whole party. Right?

06:56.416 --> 06:58.752
-Party?
-Mm-hmm.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.670
The one that we're
having at your pool today.

07:00.670 --> 07:02.672
Duh. (giggles)

07:02.672 --> 07:04.883
Oh. That sounds like fun.

07:04.883 --> 07:06.843
Meg, you in?

07:06.843 --> 07:09.179
Uh, yeah, maybe, after my shift.

07:09.179 --> 07:11.598
Oh, you know what,
don't... don't pressure her.

07:11.598 --> 07:13.516
Megan knows where to find us
if she wants to.

07:17.228 --> 07:19.397
(Luke panting on video)

07:21.983 --> 07:22.942
Megan.

07:24.235 --> 07:25.362
I need to see the rest of it.

07:28.782 --> 07:30.367
Look, I'm so sorry.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.744
I know. You've said that
a million times.

07:37.457 --> 07:38.917
(girl laughs on video)

07:42.128 --> 07:43.546
(clicks "pause")

07:56.267 --> 07:58.520
As soon as Principal Bowers
finds out it's me on the tape,

07:58.520 --> 08:01.481
she's gonna call U Dub
and they're gonna revoke
my scholarship.

08:01.481 --> 08:03.858
I'm gonna lose everything
and be stuck in Chatham

08:03.858 --> 08:06.403
for the rest of my life.

08:06.403 --> 08:08.321
What if she doesn't find out?

08:08.321 --> 08:10.532
Nothing stays secret
in this town for long.

08:10.532 --> 08:13.326
No, this can.

08:13.326 --> 08:16.204
Look, everyone already believes
that they saw me

08:16.204 --> 08:17.497
on that tape with Luke.

08:17.497 --> 08:20.458
-Right?
-Yeah, but...

08:20.458 --> 08:22.627
So let's make sure
that it stays that way.

08:22.627 --> 08:25.171
No, everyone will think
that you slept with Luke.

08:25.171 --> 08:28.049
So? I'm gone in a few months.

08:28.049 --> 08:29.843
What's the worst
that could happen?

08:29.843 --> 08:31.636
People call me a slut?

08:31.636 --> 08:33.179
I can take it.

08:33.179 --> 08:34.597
No, you shouldn't have to.

08:34.597 --> 08:35.849
I want to.

08:35.849 --> 08:38.643
Megan, you're like
a sister to me.

08:38.643 --> 08:41.020
I'm not gonna let you lose
your scholarship over this.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.064
That's a huge sacrifice.

08:43.064 --> 08:45.066
It's what best friends do.

08:45.066 --> 08:46.693
Take bullets.

08:46.693 --> 08:49.195
Give kidneys.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.781
I'm not gonna let that stupid
tape destroy your future.

08:51.781 --> 08:53.491
That's incredibly sweet, but--

08:53.491 --> 08:56.870
You're the most important person
in this world to me.

08:56.870 --> 08:58.329
Okay, I wouldn't do this
for anyone else.

09:00.582 --> 09:01.791
Ride or die isn't just words.

09:03.752 --> 09:05.962
We actually mean it, right?

09:05.962 --> 09:07.088
Yeah.

09:09.090 --> 09:11.509
You'd do the same for me
if you were in my shoes.

09:13.136 --> 09:15.138
It's how we roll.

09:15.138 --> 09:16.639
Ride or die.

09:24.272 --> 09:26.149
The coroner's report
just came in.

09:31.321 --> 09:33.031
Cause of death was drowning.

09:36.534 --> 09:38.286
There's an abrasion on his ear,

09:38.286 --> 09:40.413
suggestive of a gunshot wound.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.998
Did it penetrate?

09:41.998 --> 09:44.375
No, more like a surface nick.

09:44.375 --> 09:47.128
No evidence of the bullet,
but someone definitely
took a shot at him.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.463
Jesus.

09:48.463 --> 09:50.381
And that's not all.

09:50.381 --> 09:53.593
The toxicology report suggests
Luke had a considerable amount

09:53.593 --> 09:55.595
of benzodiazepine
in his system at the time.

09:55.595 --> 09:56.805
Hal:
Pain meds?

09:56.805 --> 09:59.182
Well, muscle relaxants.

10:00.975 --> 10:02.894
Whoever killed Luke
wanted to make sure

10:02.894 --> 10:06.106
he was severely impaired
before he went in the water.

10:06.106 --> 10:09.275
They didn't want any chance
of him coming out alive.

10:12.904 --> 10:14.656
(gulls calling in distance)

10:14.656 --> 10:16.199
(soft, indistinct conversation)

10:19.285 --> 10:21.246
Look at that.

10:21.246 --> 10:22.872
Already.

10:24.707 --> 10:26.084
Watch.

10:27.418 --> 10:30.421
Luke's gonna have
a million new best friends.

10:30.421 --> 10:32.006
What makes you say that?

10:32.006 --> 10:34.676
Everyone jumps
on the grief train.

10:36.177 --> 10:37.387
Like with Princess Diana.

10:39.097 --> 10:41.307
People who never cared
when she was alive

10:41.307 --> 10:44.144
just started suddenly
crying their eyes out
at her memorial.

10:44.144 --> 10:45.812
Like they loved her.

11:03.788 --> 11:06.749
So, what made you come here?

11:06.749 --> 11:09.085
Of all the places
that you can go?

11:09.085 --> 11:11.296
I've always been more
about people than places.

11:11.296 --> 11:13.131
I'm an only child,

11:13.131 --> 11:16.009
so I always wished that
I had brothers or sisters.

11:16.009 --> 11:17.552
That's kind of funny.

11:17.552 --> 11:19.262
I always wished
I was an only child,

11:19.262 --> 11:22.098
but that might be
more Brent-specific.

11:22.098 --> 11:23.725
It might.

11:25.602 --> 11:27.854
The family stay option
really appealed to me.

11:27.854 --> 11:30.982
And when I read Debbie's letter,
I just knew.

11:30.982 --> 11:32.483
What did she say?

11:32.483 --> 11:34.611
She talked about Megan, Lily.

11:34.611 --> 11:36.988
Was honest, warm,

11:36.988 --> 11:38.865
funny.

11:38.865 --> 11:40.700
So, like Debbie.

11:40.700 --> 11:42.118
Yeah.

11:42.118 --> 11:43.703
I loved the vibe,

11:43.703 --> 11:45.872
the pictures she sent.

11:45.872 --> 11:48.041
Seemed like a fun place
to spend the year.

11:48.041 --> 11:49.209
(laughs)

11:49.209 --> 11:52.629
Well, I'm glad you chose us.

11:52.629 --> 11:55.340
I hope we live up
to your expectations.

12:05.642 --> 12:07.185
Don't be shy.

12:07.185 --> 12:09.187
There's plenty of my meat
to go around.

12:09.187 --> 12:11.522
Nobody wants your meat.

12:11.522 --> 12:15.610
Nice try, but everyone knows
you're a carnivore, babe.

12:15.610 --> 12:17.737
Oh, great, more food.

12:22.617 --> 12:25.620
Wow. Word travels fast
around here.

12:25.620 --> 12:28.039
Yeah, it's like you kind of
tell one person something,

12:28.039 --> 12:29.874
and then the whole town knows.

12:29.874 --> 12:31.501
Last one in's
a pathetic virgin!

12:38.800 --> 12:41.052
You sure about this?

12:41.052 --> 12:43.179
All in. You can count on me.

12:43.179 --> 12:44.931
That's not what I mean.
You...

12:44.931 --> 12:47.475
You're not from here.
You don't know what
it's really like.

12:47.475 --> 12:50.561
-People will make you feel--
-What? Ashamed?

12:50.561 --> 12:53.147
They can't shame me if I have
no shame to begin with.

12:53.147 --> 12:55.066
Well, they'll try, really hard.

12:55.066 --> 12:56.442
I get it.

12:56.442 --> 12:58.861
Americans are prudish
about sex.

12:58.861 --> 13:02.282
God, it's so stupid.
I mean, without it,
none of us would even be here.

13:02.282 --> 13:03.908
I just don't want you
to regret this.

13:03.908 --> 13:05.743
I won't.

13:05.743 --> 13:07.578
I promise.

13:07.578 --> 13:12.208
As long as the truth stays
between you, me, and Luke,

13:12.208 --> 13:13.793
no one ever has to find out.

13:19.090 --> 13:21.342
Keep trying to figure out
who would have done this.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.303
I can think of one local
filmmaker with a grudge.

13:23.303 --> 13:24.971
Jeff? Really?

13:24.971 --> 13:27.473
I mean, they always talk
about women scorned, but...

13:27.473 --> 13:29.434
men are even worse.

13:29.434 --> 13:32.603
I don't know, just doesn't
seem like his style.

13:32.603 --> 13:35.773
Well, whoever it is,
we're going to find out.

13:57.295 --> 13:58.629
Where's Steve?

13:58.629 --> 14:00.131
I don't know.

14:00.131 --> 14:02.800
Talked to him an hour ago,
he said he'd be here.

14:02.800 --> 14:05.636
Sheriff Myer called him
down to the station.

14:05.636 --> 14:07.096
Why?

14:07.096 --> 14:09.223
What happened?

14:09.223 --> 14:11.309
Brent:
Luke didn't just drown.

14:11.309 --> 14:12.810
What?

14:12.810 --> 14:14.604
Brent:
Yeah, he, uh...

14:14.604 --> 14:17.065
he was...

14:17.065 --> 14:18.399
they think he was murdered.

14:24.113 --> 14:26.532
I'll take any seat you have
on the next flight to Paris.

14:26.532 --> 14:28.826
Take me with you.
God, I've been dying
to go to Paris.

14:28.826 --> 14:31.370
I can totally fit
in that carry-on too.

14:35.583 --> 14:36.667
I just need to get out of here.

14:43.091 --> 14:45.093
I'm afraid Paris
is gonna have to wait.

14:47.512 --> 14:50.014
I overheard my mom
and the sheriff
talking this morning.

14:50.014 --> 14:52.600
He's making everyone
go back down to the station.

14:52.600 --> 14:54.769
He's gonna interview us
all over again.

15:00.108 --> 15:02.318
Len: ♪ I was I was lying
on the grass ♪

15:02.318 --> 15:05.321
♪ On Sunday morning
of last week ♪

15:05.321 --> 15:07.406
♪ Indulging
in my self-defeat ♪

15:07.406 --> 15:08.908
That looks intense.

15:08.908 --> 15:11.077
Yeah, intensely awesome.

15:13.621 --> 15:16.207
(water splashes)

15:16.207 --> 15:18.835
That suntan oil smells so good.

15:18.835 --> 15:21.921
Oh, it's baby oil.
Gives the best tan.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.756
Plus, it makes you look younger.

15:23.756 --> 15:25.591
Like a baby, you know.

15:25.591 --> 15:27.510
(girls giggle)

15:29.679 --> 15:33.182
-Okay, Tarantino,
that is enough.
-Jeff: Whoa, take it easy!

15:33.182 --> 15:36.227
That Radiohead song
that you played the other night
was really cool.

15:36.227 --> 15:38.855
(murmuring)

15:40.690 --> 15:43.484
No one touches the book,
especially strangers.

15:43.484 --> 15:45.653
Relax. I come in peace.

15:45.653 --> 15:47.738
I just wanted to see
what Brent had for options.

15:47.738 --> 15:49.490
They aren't Brent's,
they're mine.

15:49.490 --> 15:51.868
Oh. Then that explains it.

15:51.868 --> 15:54.954
Couldn't believe that Brent
had such great taste in music.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.747
You should help Luke
put on sunscreen.

15:56.747 --> 15:57.874
He's looking red.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.794
guy:
Who wants to go skinny dipping?

16:01.794 --> 16:03.754
(indistinct chatter)

16:08.176 --> 16:10.386
Hey. Nice swimsuit.

16:10.386 --> 16:12.263
I actually have one
just like that.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.598
Different color, though.

16:13.598 --> 16:15.224
Maybe we can trade.

16:20.354 --> 16:23.274
So, I'm just supposed to let
people think I cheated on you?

16:23.274 --> 16:26.903
Please. With your crew,
you'll get a free round
of drinks and a merit badge.

16:26.903 --> 16:29.405
Not from my dad.
He scheduled a family
meeting for tonight.

16:29.405 --> 16:30.907
I'm going to get crucified.

16:30.907 --> 16:32.700
And you didn't
even do anything wrong.

16:32.700 --> 16:36.329
Publicly embarrassing
Steve Chambers is
a pretty major offense.

16:36.329 --> 16:38.748
Brent's gonna deny
having anything to do with it,

16:38.748 --> 16:41.250
and my dad will buy
whatever bullshit
he sells him, like always.

16:41.250 --> 16:42.960
So you think Brent
made the tape?

16:42.960 --> 16:44.337
Yeah, who else?

16:44.337 --> 16:46.923
-My money's on Jeff.
-No, I don't think so.

16:46.923 --> 16:48.799
His stuff looks way more
professional than that.

16:48.799 --> 16:51.093
This wreaks of Brent.

16:51.093 --> 16:52.803
He got a video camera
for his birthday.

16:52.803 --> 16:54.889
He's always bringing girls
to the cabin.

16:54.889 --> 16:57.934
Maybe he'd make the tape,
but he wouldn't play it,
not at your dad's big party.

16:57.934 --> 17:00.186
Maybe it was a team effort.

17:00.186 --> 17:02.480
Jeff and Brent.

17:02.480 --> 17:05.983
Look, either way,
we have to talk to them.

17:05.983 --> 17:07.401
Now.

17:07.401 --> 17:09.028
Just hold on.

17:11.697 --> 17:14.492
I will go along
with whatever plan you want.

17:14.492 --> 17:16.369
Okay? But I'm
gonna handle my brother.

17:18.454 --> 17:22.250
-You... handle Brent?
-Yeah.

17:22.250 --> 17:25.127
-Like that'll ever happen.
-Excuse me, what is that
supposed to mean?

17:25.127 --> 17:26.712
Guys, chill,
don't make a scene.

17:26.712 --> 17:28.589
Megan's always
been there for you.

17:28.589 --> 17:31.634
You owe her.
If you don't make
this right for her, Luke,

17:31.634 --> 17:33.261
I swear to God...

17:33.261 --> 17:35.805
Hold on, I've known Megan
her whole life.

17:35.805 --> 17:37.515
You've known her for, like,
five minutes, okay?

17:37.515 --> 17:38.933
This is our town,
you're just a tourist.

17:38.933 --> 17:40.476
Back up.

17:40.476 --> 17:42.812
What are you guys doing?
Like we need more attention.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.605
-Stop.
-Luke.

17:44.605 --> 17:46.899
Give me a hand.

17:46.899 --> 17:49.235
Yeah, I'll...
I'll be there in a second.

17:49.235 --> 17:50.945
S-Sorry, just one sec.

17:50.945 --> 17:54.240
Just lay low
until I talk to Brent.

17:54.240 --> 17:56.534
Okay? Last thing we need
is to make things worse.

18:04.458 --> 18:05.751
Let's go home.

18:05.751 --> 18:08.588
I've had enough of the spotlight
for one day.

18:08.588 --> 18:11.882
I'll drop you off.
There's something I want to do.

18:17.555 --> 18:18.806
(indistinct chatter)

18:18.806 --> 18:20.600
The sheriff's crazy.

18:22.226 --> 18:25.271
What does he want from us?

18:25.271 --> 18:27.356
You kill Luke so you could
have Megan all to yourself?

18:27.356 --> 18:29.108
Talk about
a bizarre love triangle.

18:29.108 --> 18:31.110
(scoffs) Just ignore them,
they're assholes.

18:31.110 --> 18:33.404
They're just saying
what everyone thinks.

18:38.159 --> 18:39.785
I'll meet you inside.

18:48.252 --> 18:49.503
Megan:
Get out.

18:51.714 --> 18:53.966
What are you
going to tell the sheriff?

18:53.966 --> 18:55.676
Depends what he asks.

18:55.676 --> 18:58.471
Look, we need to stick
to our story.

18:58.471 --> 19:00.348
And then it will all be over.

19:06.812 --> 19:09.023
I'm leaving on Tuesday.

19:09.023 --> 19:10.983
What?

19:10.983 --> 19:12.360
Now?

19:13.569 --> 19:15.112
Yeah.

19:15.112 --> 19:17.990
You think you can just bounce,
like nothing happened?

19:17.990 --> 19:19.992
You're just gonna leave me
here to take the blame?

19:19.992 --> 19:21.661
You're unbelievable!

19:21.661 --> 19:24.163
I thought you'd be happy
to never see me again.

19:24.163 --> 19:27.667
I will be, but until this is
over, you're not going anywhere.

19:27.667 --> 19:29.669
Not if you want me
to keep my mouth shut.

19:50.147 --> 19:51.607
(rattling)

19:57.279 --> 19:58.698
What the hell
are you doing here?

19:58.698 --> 20:00.282
I was looking for Brent.

20:00.282 --> 20:01.992
Me too.

20:01.992 --> 20:03.452
Parker:
Oh.

20:03.452 --> 20:05.287
I thought you guys broke up.

20:05.287 --> 20:07.373
Yeah, we did,
at the end of summer.

20:09.083 --> 20:11.168
Um...

20:11.168 --> 20:14.296
he tried to film me once,
and I told him no,

20:14.296 --> 20:16.257
but, I don't know,
now I'm thinking

20:16.257 --> 20:18.384
maybe he did
and I just don't know about it.

20:18.384 --> 20:20.177
God, he's such a creep.

20:20.177 --> 20:22.346
Yeah, tell me something
I don't know.

20:22.346 --> 20:24.390
We have to get in his house.

20:24.390 --> 20:26.600
Yeah, there used to be, like,
a hide-a-key out here somewhere,

20:26.600 --> 20:27.852
but I haven't found it yet.

20:27.852 --> 20:28.853
I'll help you look.

20:31.480 --> 20:33.065
-Come on.
-Okay.

20:35.109 --> 20:37.903
-So, did Megan kick you out?
-No.

20:37.903 --> 20:40.197
Oh, wow.
That's an impressive chill.

20:40.197 --> 20:42.241
If my best friend
slept with my boyfriend,

20:42.241 --> 20:43.951
I'd, like, shave her head.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.870
I sure as hell wouldn't
let her live with me.

20:45.870 --> 20:47.037
(rattles door)

20:47.037 --> 20:49.665
Trust me,
things are super tense,

20:49.665 --> 20:51.959
but the only thing
that I'm concerned with

20:51.959 --> 20:54.003
is getting in the house
and finding those tapes.

20:54.003 --> 20:55.004
Parker:
Yeah.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.731
Coming?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.277
(glass crunching)

21:18.277 --> 21:20.404
(upbeat music playing)

21:22.239 --> 21:24.074
Hey, you need a hand with that?

21:24.074 --> 21:26.702
Squeezing a lime?

21:26.702 --> 21:29.997
We squeeze differently
in America.

21:29.997 --> 21:32.374
-Hmm. I'm sure you do.
-Mm-hmm.

21:34.210 --> 21:35.836
How about you

21:35.836 --> 21:37.922
stick to squeezing your own?

21:37.922 --> 21:40.549
I'm guessing you've had, like,
a lot of practice with that.

21:40.549 --> 21:42.301
Or, you know what?

21:42.301 --> 21:45.095
I'm sure that Parker
would love a demonstration.

21:45.095 --> 21:46.972
-No, chill.
-You should go ask her.

21:46.972 --> 21:48.808
Jeez.

21:48.808 --> 21:50.518
I thought you European chicks

21:50.518 --> 21:52.561
were supposed
to be more open-minded.

21:52.561 --> 21:54.396
I'm open-minded.

21:54.396 --> 21:56.857
But I'm not European.

21:56.857 --> 21:59.318
-Hey.
-Hey, you came.

21:59.318 --> 22:02.029
-Can you stash this back there?
-Yeah.

22:02.029 --> 22:04.198
Everything cool?

22:04.198 --> 22:05.866
More like tepid.

22:05.866 --> 22:08.452
Watch out, she's got a knife.

22:08.452 --> 22:09.745
You want a drink?

22:09.745 --> 22:11.497
It's lemonade, no booze.

22:11.497 --> 22:13.040
Megan:
Oh.

22:13.040 --> 22:14.875
I pay attention.

22:14.875 --> 22:17.086
Details are everything.

22:17.086 --> 22:19.296
Yeah. Doesn't seem
like you miss much.

22:24.677 --> 22:27.304

-They keep all
their movies in here.

22:29.515 --> 22:31.517
Could be any of them.

22:31.517 --> 22:34.520
Um, or, like, none of them.

22:38.649 --> 22:40.317
-"Christmas '88."
-Oh, wait, stop.

22:40.317 --> 22:43.737
Their mom was alive then.
Don't ruin these.

22:43.737 --> 22:46.073
Okay. These are all
Brent's sports tapes.

22:46.073 --> 22:47.116
Okay.

22:50.661 --> 22:52.913
I don't want to think
about what he calls sports.

22:52.913 --> 22:55.291
Alanis Morissette:

23:02.673 --> 23:04.508

Hey, by the way,
how's it going with Megan?

23:23.527 --> 23:25.863
Still trying to figure her out.

23:25.863 --> 23:27.948
Any tips?

23:27.948 --> 23:30.409
Well, first thing is,

23:30.409 --> 23:32.494
she's never really been great
at letting new people in,

23:32.494 --> 23:34.747
so it's not personal.

23:34.747 --> 23:36.665
And yet it feels like it is.

23:36.665 --> 23:38.167
Yeah, well, I get that.

23:38.167 --> 23:40.252
But...

23:40.252 --> 23:41.754
you know, it's...

23:41.754 --> 23:43.213
it's worth the struggle.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.049
Okay? 'Cause once
you get through it,

23:45.049 --> 23:48.802
she's like
the most loyal friend.

23:48.802 --> 23:52.097
And I'm talking like,
"help you bury a body" loyal.

23:52.097 --> 23:54.224
Are you speaking
from experience?

23:54.224 --> 23:57.061
A good friend never tells.

23:57.061 --> 23:59.063
Hmm.

23:59.063 --> 24:02.191
Look, I would just say...

24:02.191 --> 24:03.817
just be yourself.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.235
Okay?

24:05.235 --> 24:07.863
I mean, you're kind of awesome,

24:07.863 --> 24:10.199
and, uh, she'll come around.

24:12.701 --> 24:14.995
Could you maybe put in
a good word for me?

24:14.995 --> 24:16.664
Yeah, already done.

24:16.664 --> 24:18.749
-Thanks.
-Mm-hmm.

24:18.749 --> 24:20.167
Let's do this.

24:20.167 --> 24:21.919
Isabella:
Let's go par-tay!

24:27.925 --> 24:30.594
Tape is the gift
that's gonna keep giving, huh?

24:30.594 --> 24:33.722
What's next? Somebody's gonna
come burn our house down?

24:35.975 --> 24:37.768
Is it the only tape?

24:37.768 --> 24:40.187
I think you should ask
your number-one son.

24:40.187 --> 24:43.148
-Oh, Dad, look--
-Is that the only tape?

24:45.359 --> 24:46.777
-Yes.
-That's a lie.

24:46.777 --> 24:48.404
-Steve: Luke, Luke.
-No, that's a lie.

24:48.404 --> 24:50.280
Stop talking! Stop.

24:55.035 --> 24:57.162
You guys clean
this shit up, okay?

24:57.162 --> 24:58.872
I'm done cleaning up
your messes.

24:58.872 --> 25:00.207
Luke:
Dad.

25:01.959 --> 25:04.586
I'm sorry.

25:04.586 --> 25:07.172
If I were you,
I'd be saying that to Megan.

25:09.466 --> 25:12.511
You guys have no idea
what this might cost our family.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.272
Eight years down the drain.

25:25.566 --> 25:26.859
It's not true.

25:28.569 --> 25:30.070
I cheated once before.

25:32.948 --> 25:34.450
Jane's first anniversary.

25:39.038 --> 25:40.205
I'm so sorry.

25:42.791 --> 25:44.460
I don't even know
where to begin.

25:44.460 --> 25:45.586
I just...

25:50.049 --> 25:51.133
I'm here for you.

25:52.634 --> 25:54.553
Any time.

25:54.553 --> 25:56.055
You might not want to be, huh?

25:56.055 --> 25:57.931
-(clicks lighter)
-Steve.

25:57.931 --> 26:01.310
I mean... it feels
like I'm cursed.

26:02.895 --> 26:05.439
Getting punished
for something...

26:07.608 --> 26:09.777
First Jane, now Luke?

26:09.777 --> 26:11.320
Don't go there.

26:11.320 --> 26:12.946
Kind of hard not to.

26:18.702 --> 26:20.788
Even as the weeks
and the months went by

26:20.788 --> 26:22.790
with no word,

26:22.790 --> 26:25.167
I just kept thinking
he was gonna come home.

26:28.212 --> 26:30.130
(rock music playing)

26:30.130 --> 26:33.092
(indistinct chatter, laughter)

26:54.488 --> 26:56.156
Marco!

26:56.156 --> 26:58.450
(fireworks whistling)

27:08.919 --> 27:10.129
Whoo!

27:10.129 --> 27:12.339
Isabella: Whoo!

27:12.339 --> 27:14.049
-Whoo-hoo! Let's go!
-Whoo!

27:14.049 --> 27:18.345
Tal Bachman:
♪ 'Cause she's so high ♪

27:18.345 --> 27:20.514
♪ High above me ♪

27:20.514 --> 27:22.182
♪ She's so lovely ♪

27:22.182 --> 27:26.270

27:26.270 --> 27:28.480

27:28.480 --> 27:30.023

27:30.023 --> 27:33.986

27:33.986 --> 27:35.988
♪ High above me ♪

27:35.988 --> 27:38.240
Hey.

27:38.240 --> 27:39.825
-Thanks, pyro.
-Yeah.

27:39.825 --> 27:41.201
(fireworks bursting)

27:41.201 --> 27:42.870
Let me guess, this was her idea?

27:42.870 --> 27:44.496
guest:
Whoo!

27:44.496 --> 27:47.666
Uh... well, it was more
of a joint effort.

27:47.666 --> 27:50.043
Well, she does have a way
of being the center
of attention.

27:50.043 --> 27:52.629
Look, can you cut her
some slack?

27:52.629 --> 27:55.048
I mean, she's been in town
for what, like a minute,

27:55.048 --> 27:58.176
and you're acting
like she's radioactive.

27:58.176 --> 28:00.470
What do you want her to do,
pack up her stuff, go home?

28:00.470 --> 28:02.014
No.

28:02.014 --> 28:04.516
Well, I'm just saying,

28:04.516 --> 28:08.353
it wouldn't kill you to make,
like, a tiny bit of effort.

28:11.732 --> 28:15.193
♪ You're looking at me ♪

28:17.654 --> 28:20.991
♪ You're looking at me ♪

28:20.991 --> 28:23.744
You threw a planter
through the door?

28:23.744 --> 28:26.580
I'm a badass, what can I say?

28:26.580 --> 28:30.000
(laughs) It's...
it's a little crazy.

28:30.000 --> 28:33.921
Hey, there's nothing
I wouldn't do for my girl.

28:35.672 --> 28:38.884
I know you're scared, but...

28:38.884 --> 28:41.303
this is all gonna work out.

28:41.303 --> 28:42.721
I promise.

28:42.721 --> 28:45.849
I don't know
what I'd do without you.

28:45.849 --> 28:47.517
Don't even sweat it.

28:48.769 --> 28:50.145
You're stuck with me.

28:50.145 --> 28:51.271
(both laugh)

28:51.271 --> 28:54.274
I'm not going anywhere, okay?

28:54.274 --> 28:55.901
This will all blow over soon.

28:58.862 --> 29:02.240
And then... everything
will go back to normal.

29:02.240 --> 29:03.450
Okay?

29:05.911 --> 29:07.871
(indistinct chatter)

29:13.251 --> 29:15.087
Mind if I join?

29:15.087 --> 29:16.630
It's your party.

29:16.630 --> 29:19.049
(fireworks bursting)

29:19.049 --> 29:21.134
Actually, the real party's
in your bag.

29:23.470 --> 29:27.099
Guess Miss Squeaky Clean
has her share of dirt.

29:27.099 --> 29:30.310
(scoffs) What are you,
some kind of klepto?

29:30.310 --> 29:34.231
No. I was actually
rescuing your bag,

29:34.231 --> 29:37.109
protecting your secret stash.

29:37.109 --> 29:38.902
So, you're welcome.

29:41.863 --> 29:44.866
Everyone around here says
how well that they know you,

29:44.866 --> 29:46.576
but...

29:46.576 --> 29:48.829
clearly they don't know
the real you.

29:48.829 --> 29:49.955
It's not like that.

29:49.955 --> 29:51.456
It's cool.

29:51.456 --> 29:54.668
Everyone has their thing.
I don't judge.

29:54.668 --> 29:56.336
It's not a thing. They're...

29:56.336 --> 29:59.339
They're for school
to stay up late, study.

29:59.339 --> 30:02.300
For an advantage, you mean.

30:02.300 --> 30:06.013
I'm just doing what I have to
to get what I want.

30:08.974 --> 30:11.393
Ladies and gentlemen,

30:11.393 --> 30:13.812
the real Megan Landry
has entered the building.

30:13.812 --> 30:17.691
(fireworks whistling)

30:17.691 --> 30:21.028
Look... I know it wasn't
your idea for me to come here.

30:23.530 --> 30:26.575
There's no rule that says
that we have to get along.

30:26.575 --> 30:29.077
So, how about we just...

30:29.077 --> 30:31.204
find a way to be okay
with each other?

30:34.332 --> 30:38.211
Don't worry, your advantage
is safe with me.

30:59.566 --> 31:01.276
When did you last see Luke?

31:01.276 --> 31:03.570
Um, at the New Year's Eve party.

31:03.570 --> 31:05.572
Yeah. He was wearing
those stupid glasses.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.324
You know, like the "2000" ones?

31:07.324 --> 31:08.742
(chuckles)

31:08.742 --> 31:10.327
How was his mood?

31:10.327 --> 31:12.412
He seemed fine.

31:12.412 --> 31:13.538
Happy.

31:15.707 --> 31:19.002
He and Megan had gone past
that stuff with the tape.

31:19.002 --> 31:21.171
They were all kissy.

31:21.171 --> 31:22.756
Really cute.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.217
Did you see Luke leave?

31:25.217 --> 31:28.220
Yeah. He was with Megan.

31:28.220 --> 31:29.763
Were they getting along?

31:31.765 --> 31:34.643
I mean, they seemed
really chill.

31:34.643 --> 31:36.520
Like things couldn't
have been better.

31:36.520 --> 31:38.063
How about Isabella?

31:38.063 --> 31:39.606
Was she there?

31:39.606 --> 31:41.858
For a while, but she left early,

31:41.858 --> 31:43.819
and she and Megan were fighting.

31:43.819 --> 31:46.613
I mean, they used to be besties,

31:46.613 --> 31:48.240
so close.

31:48.240 --> 31:50.784
I mean, the whole town

31:50.784 --> 31:53.537
saw Isabella and Luke
together on that tape.

31:53.537 --> 31:55.080
If I had a friend like that,

31:55.080 --> 31:57.207
I would never forgive them.

31:57.207 --> 31:58.792
What was the fight about?

32:00.961 --> 32:02.796
I don't know, man,
I don't speak "girl."

32:02.796 --> 32:04.923
But, uh, I was bummed.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.967
You know, Isabella
was my number-one resolution

32:06.967 --> 32:08.135
for Y2K.

32:10.679 --> 32:13.265
Sounds like a crazy night.

32:13.265 --> 32:15.225
Yeah, it was dope.

32:15.225 --> 32:18.311
People thought
the world was gonna end,
but obviously it didn't.

32:18.311 --> 32:20.272
I don't think Luke
would see it that way.

32:23.191 --> 32:25.235
So, you and Luke dated
last summer,

32:25.235 --> 32:28.822
and then you broke up
and he started seeing Megan.

32:28.822 --> 32:30.157
That's right.

32:30.157 --> 32:31.867
Sheriff: And then came
that business with...

32:31.867 --> 32:34.161
An illegally recorded tape
of us having sex.

32:35.829 --> 32:38.123
Things sure changed
after that, didn't they?

32:38.123 --> 32:40.250
I'm a minor.

32:40.250 --> 32:43.753
Shouldn't you be more concerned
about who made the tape?

32:43.753 --> 32:46.047
What's your question, Jack?

32:46.047 --> 32:50.886
You know, after all
you've been through, Isabella,

32:50.886 --> 32:53.221
why are you still here
in Chatham?

32:53.221 --> 32:56.183
You mean, why didn't I
let myself get run out of town?

32:56.183 --> 33:00.145
-Come on, Isabella,
we're leaving.
-Sit down, Debbie.

33:00.145 --> 33:01.396
I got this.

33:08.778 --> 33:11.489
You know, when I talked
to you back when Luke
first disappeared,

33:11.489 --> 33:14.492
you were ready to leave town
the moment school ended.

33:14.492 --> 33:16.786
Pretty sure you even had
your plane ticket.

33:16.786 --> 33:18.496
That's true.

33:18.496 --> 33:21.499
But Debbie got sick.

33:21.499 --> 33:23.668
So I decided to stay
and help out.

33:23.668 --> 33:26.671
Oh, that was very kind of you.

33:26.671 --> 33:30.592
Also convenient, given your
situation before you came here.

33:30.592 --> 33:32.010
Situation?

33:32.010 --> 33:35.388
Three schools in three years.

33:35.388 --> 33:37.766
Didn't even finish your
junior year at the last place.

33:37.766 --> 33:40.268
-Left mid-semester.
-Is that all you've
got on me, Sheriff?

33:40.268 --> 33:42.145
For now.

33:42.145 --> 33:46.274
But, you know, it's kind of hard
not to notice a pattern.

33:46.274 --> 33:49.236
Trouble seems to follow you
wherever you go.

33:49.236 --> 33:51.196
We're not done.

33:51.196 --> 33:54.157
Yeah. Yeah, we are.

33:54.157 --> 33:56.284
I'm not saying another word
without my lawyer.

34:07.837 --> 34:11.299
What kind of a 17-year-old
knows when to ask for a lawyer?

34:11.299 --> 34:13.426
One who's needed one before.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.439
Did he leave?

34:27.983 --> 34:29.567
Yeah. Business center
or something.

34:29.567 --> 34:33.405
Man, I have not seen him
mad like that in a while.

34:33.405 --> 34:35.282
(scoffs)
You and your friggin' tapes.

34:35.282 --> 34:36.825
Hey, that was not one of mine.

34:36.825 --> 34:38.785
Okay? Somebody else
made you a celebrity.

34:38.785 --> 34:40.578
Yeah? How can you keep track?

34:40.578 --> 34:42.622
From what I hear,
you've got a whole collection.

34:42.622 --> 34:45.417
-Dude...
-Do you even care
about those girls?

34:45.417 --> 34:48.420
Look, these skanks
love the attention.

34:48.420 --> 34:50.255
Okay?

34:50.255 --> 34:52.507
Remember that girl Jennie
I dated freshman year?

34:52.507 --> 34:54.384
She would film everything
that we did,

34:54.384 --> 34:55.552
that's how I got the idea.

34:56.720 --> 34:58.513
You're an asshole.

34:58.513 --> 35:01.391
All right, dude, just trust me,

35:01.391 --> 35:03.393
these girls love
being small-town famous,

35:03.393 --> 35:06.062
and when Isabella is 40,
she's gonna look back

35:06.062 --> 35:08.565
and think of these
as the best days of her life.

35:08.565 --> 35:10.150
The pathetic part
is that you will too.

35:10.150 --> 35:12.652
Dude, look...

35:12.652 --> 35:15.822
why are you being such
a little bitch about this, man?

35:15.822 --> 35:18.658
Like, those girls,
they have you by the balls.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.703
No, look, I get that you
don't give a shit about me.

35:21.703 --> 35:25.248
I get that, but I cannot believe
you would humiliate
Dad like that.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.209
Dude, I... I don't have
a death wish, okay?

35:28.209 --> 35:29.252
Like...

35:32.255 --> 35:34.257
Look...

35:34.257 --> 35:36.384
I don't know
who put that tape in,

35:36.384 --> 35:38.970
but it sure as hell
wasn't me, all right?

35:46.645 --> 35:49.397

Yeah, me too.

36:01.034 --> 36:02.827
I remember when I was little,

36:02.827 --> 36:04.871
my mom would take us
night swimming,

36:04.871 --> 36:07.749
and... the pool lights
would cast these shadows

36:07.749 --> 36:10.418
that looked like
big monsters.

36:11.961 --> 36:13.755
And it was so quiet.

36:13.755 --> 36:18.009
Mom had one rule:
not to get our hair wet.

36:18.009 --> 36:19.386
But...

36:19.386 --> 36:20.720
we actually always got
our hair wet.

36:24.641 --> 36:25.809
(fireworks whistling)

36:30.855 --> 36:33.024
Wait, oh, no. My earring.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.150
What's wrong?

36:34.150 --> 36:35.902
It's gone.

36:35.902 --> 36:37.487
Luke, seriously, it's special.

36:37.487 --> 36:39.114
My friend Lisa gave it to me.

36:39.114 --> 36:42.117
Okay, okay, well,
it's probably in the pool.

36:42.117 --> 36:43.785
Just give me a second,
I'll look for it, okay?

36:54.963 --> 36:56.339
Success!

36:56.339 --> 36:57.632
(laughs) I found it.

Luke: It's like Brent gets
this free pass for everything.

37:28.371 --> 37:31.249
Meanwhile, I'm just
this constant disappointment.

37:31.249 --> 37:32.584
It's not true.

37:34.252 --> 37:36.421
It kind of is.

37:36.421 --> 37:38.256
Your dad loves you.

37:38.256 --> 37:41.342
Technically, maybe.

37:41.342 --> 37:43.011
But he doesn't like me much.

37:44.929 --> 37:46.139
I'm not a jock.

37:47.599 --> 37:50.185
I have no interest in business.

37:50.185 --> 37:55.064
(scoffs) I was on a sex tape
at his big party.

37:57.108 --> 38:00.820
Now the only thing
that's worse is he...

38:00.820 --> 38:02.822
everyone...

38:02.822 --> 38:04.282
thinks I cheated on you.

38:06.618 --> 38:09.370
I mean, I know the truth.

38:09.370 --> 38:10.538
That's all that matters.

38:17.754 --> 38:20.715
Does Brent know
that it's me on the tape?

38:20.715 --> 38:22.217
No.

38:22.217 --> 38:24.469
He stopped watching
the second he saw me on it.

38:24.469 --> 38:26.137
He still thinks it's Isabella.

38:26.137 --> 38:27.931
You're sure?

38:27.931 --> 38:29.474
Positive.

38:31.100 --> 38:34.729
He's a total creep,
but he can't keep a secret.

38:34.729 --> 38:36.231
He would have said something
right away.

38:38.149 --> 38:42.320
You're the most important person
in the world to me.

38:42.320 --> 38:47.325
I'm not going to let anything
or anyone come between us.

38:47.325 --> 38:48.535
Ride or die.

39:13.434 --> 39:15.228
There's something
you need to know.

39:17.689 --> 39:21.484
(indistinct chatter)

39:21.484 --> 39:22.861
Yeah. No, I was not
expecting...

39:22.861 --> 39:24.112
I was so scared...

39:24.112 --> 39:26.531
All right, y'all.
Ready? Picture time.

39:26.531 --> 39:28.575
Let's go.

39:28.575 --> 39:30.869
Uh, Megan, you're in the shot.

39:30.869 --> 39:32.495
-Oh.
-Isabella: Oh, no.
No, no, Megan.

39:32.495 --> 39:34.789
Come on.
She's supposed to be in it.

39:34.789 --> 39:37.125
-Come on.
-Jeff: All right, ready?

39:37.125 --> 39:38.835
Three, two, one...

39:40.712 --> 39:42.547
Wait, I think that I blinked.

39:42.547 --> 39:44.299
Can we, like...
can we do another?

39:44.299 --> 39:46.342
-Jeff: All right, let's go.
-One more.

39:46.342 --> 39:47.468
Jeff:
You ready?

39:47.468 --> 39:50.513
Three, two, one...

39:50.513 --> 39:51.723
Smile.

39:51.723 --> 39:54.017
(laughing)

39:54.017 --> 39:56.352
That's another one. Ah!

39:56.352 --> 39:59.063
(phone line ringing)

40:03.610 --> 40:05.737
(ringing continues)

40:10.074 --> 40:11.492
(ringing continues)

40:11.492 --> 40:13.036
Vivian:
(drowsily) Hello?

40:13.036 --> 40:14.787
Isabella:
Mom.

40:14.787 --> 40:17.081
It's late.
Is everything okay?

40:21.461 --> 40:23.046
I need your help.

40:34.098 --> 40:35.808
I'm in trouble.

40:38.811 --> 40:41.147
(theme song playing)
