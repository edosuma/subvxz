01:09.294 --> 01:12.905
<i>So cigarettes and gas is...</i>

01:12.939 --> 01:15.748
$79.70

01:17.656 --> 01:19.595
Crap.

01:19.630 --> 01:21.568
Oh, there's an ATM
right outside.

01:21.603 --> 01:25.748
Yeah,
I don't have a card.

01:25.783 --> 01:28.557
Well, you can write
a personal check with I.D.

01:29.862 --> 01:32.470
Kind of in between banks
right now.

01:34.109 --> 01:36.982
You think I could just
come back later?

01:37.016 --> 01:39.156
I'm totally good for it.
I'd come back.

01:39.191 --> 01:40.226
I swear.

01:43.202 --> 01:46.676
If it were me, I'd be,
"Totally, you know,
no problem."

01:46.710 --> 01:49.484
But my dad is this
ginormous hardass.

01:49.518 --> 01:51.255
He was in Fallujah for a year,

01:51.290 --> 01:53.327
and he always checks
the receipts.

01:53.362 --> 01:56.268
I mean, like...always.

01:56.303 --> 01:58.005
I've got to call him.
I'm sorry.

01:58.039 --> 01:59.443
Wait, wait, wait.

01:59.477 --> 02:02.184
Hold-- Hold on a second.

02:04.055 --> 02:07.363
Maybe if we could, um...

02:07.397 --> 02:08.899
trade.

02:15.081 --> 02:17.554
Ever try it?

02:17.588 --> 02:21.596
I mean, I smoke pot
a lot sometimes.

02:21.630 --> 02:23.634
I party.

02:23.668 --> 02:27.443
But-- But that stuff's
really addictive, right?

02:27.477 --> 02:32.320
Not really. It's just
a media thing. You know?

02:36.028 --> 02:37.931
What's it like?

02:42.910 --> 02:44.512
It's awesome.

02:46.651 --> 02:51.460
Everything's
maximum interesting.

02:51.494 --> 02:53.865
You get these really cold

02:53.899 --> 02:58.474
and sharp-like
action dagger feelings.

03:02.750 --> 03:04.887
It's awesome.

03:06.258 --> 03:08.527
Come on.
What do you say?

03:43.793 --> 03:44.793
<font color="#EC14BD">Sync by honeybunny</font>
<font color="#EC14BD">www.addic7ed.com</font>

04:04.789 --> 04:14.792
Have a nice day.

04:23.696 --> 04:25.663
Now, how does it feel?

04:25.698 --> 04:27.031
Does it hurt?

04:27.065 --> 04:29.533
Yeah, it's tight.

04:29.567 --> 04:32.001
Okay, but is it painful?

04:32.036 --> 04:33.770
It's hard to breathe.

04:33.804 --> 04:36.772
Well,
you need your breathing.

04:36.806 --> 04:38.707
Uh, well--

04:38.741 --> 04:40.674
although let's not
lose sight of the fact

04:40.709 --> 04:43.276
that you were the victim
of a terrible accident,
Antonio,

04:43.309 --> 04:45.709
so some discomfort
is to be expected.

04:52.816 --> 04:55.351
Let's go with that one.

04:55.386 --> 04:58.622
<i>Mucho gusto
en conocerle, seÃƒÂ±ora.</i>

04:58.657 --> 05:00.057
<i>La proxima vez,</i>

05:00.092 --> 05:01.759
<i>cashier's check, por favor.</i>

05:01.793 --> 05:03.093
Oh, and spread the word.

05:03.127 --> 05:06.062
I'm building a class-action,
flight 515.

05:06.097 --> 05:08.031
Victims' families
would be great,

05:08.065 --> 05:09.232
but I'll take
anyone on he ground

05:09.266 --> 05:10.766
who suffered emotionally--

05:10.800 --> 05:14.202
anxiety, sleeplessness,
you get the picture.

05:14.237 --> 05:15.236
Trouble?

05:16.939 --> 05:19.173
<i>Ted Beneke?
You cannot be serious.</i>

05:19.207 --> 05:20.341
<i>That guys is a joke.</i>

05:20.375 --> 05:21.508
<i>You know what, Walt?</i>

05:21.543 --> 05:22.676
<i>You know what?
You called my bluff.</i>

05:22.710 --> 05:24.410
<i>I called your--
What does that even mean?</i>

05:24.445 --> 05:26.012
<i>You dared me
to tell the police,</i>

05:26.046 --> 05:28.047
<i>and I couldn't do it,
so you win.</i>

05:28.081 --> 05:29.748
<i>If you want to stay
in this house, fine,</i>

05:29.783 --> 05:31.516
<i>but we are not married
anymore.</i>

05:31.551 --> 05:34.018
<i>I told you that I was done
cooking meth, Skyler.</i>

05:34.053 --> 05:35.353
<i>Oh, right.
I promised you that.</i>

05:35.387 --> 05:36.888
<i>And so what?</i>

05:36.922 --> 05:38.822
<i>At least I didn't
run off to go--</i>

05:38.857 --> 05:41.291
<i>Jesus! I mean,
everything that I did</i>

05:41.325 --> 05:42.926
<i>I did for this family.</i>

05:42.960 --> 05:44.360
<i>Oh, yeah, you just keep
telling yourself that.</i>

05:44.395 --> 05:46.128
<i>Oh, and what is that
supposed to mean?</i>

05:46.163 --> 05:47.963
<i>You don't like it?
Then leave</i>

05:47.998 --> 05:49.831
<i>and take your
drug money with you.</i>

05:49.866 --> 05:52.867
<i>That's what you want.</i>

05:52.902 --> 05:54.669
Jesus.

05:54.703 --> 05:56.570
Garbage disposal.

05:56.605 --> 05:58.605
<i>You think this will
get me to move out?</i>

05:58.640 --> 06:00.073
<i>You can screw Ted.</i>

06:00.108 --> 06:02.308
<i>You can screw the butcher,
the mailman,</i>

06:02.343 --> 06:03.409
<i>whoever you want.</i>

06:03.443 --> 06:04.443
<i>Screw them all.</i>

06:04.478 --> 06:05.878
<i>I'm not going anywhere.</i>

06:05.912 --> 06:06.912
<i>Good. Suit yourself.</i>

06:08.514 --> 06:10.749
Is this a good
or bad thing?

06:12.618 --> 06:14.085
<i>You want me to suit myself?</i>

06:14.119 --> 06:16.987
<i>I'll suit myself
to his face!</i>

06:17.021 --> 06:18.689
It's a bad thing.

06:29.666 --> 06:30.766
Hello.

06:30.800 --> 06:32.267
Ahem.

06:32.302 --> 06:34.236
Walter White
to see Ted Beneke.

06:34.270 --> 06:37.305
I'm sorry. Mr. Beneke's
on a conference call.

06:37.339 --> 06:40.107
Mm-hmm, okay.

06:40.142 --> 06:42.375
I will wait.

06:42.410 --> 06:44.444
It could be a while.

06:44.478 --> 06:46.513
I have all the time
in the world.

07:12.368 --> 07:15.470
Okay.

07:15.504 --> 07:17.138
Here we go. Okay.

07:17.172 --> 07:19.207
Excuse me. Mr. Beneke's
not available.
Ted?

07:19.241 --> 07:21.375
Come on.

07:24.412 --> 07:26.580
Ted, I can see you.

07:26.614 --> 07:29.215
I can see you standing
right there in your office.

07:29.250 --> 07:31.150
Now, come on.

07:31.185 --> 07:33.552
Open the door.
Come on, let's talk.

07:33.586 --> 07:35.520
I just want to talk.
That's all.

07:35.555 --> 07:37.055
Come on, let's be men
about this. Huh? Okay?

07:37.089 --> 07:38.322
How about that?

07:38.357 --> 07:40.224
Aha.

07:40.259 --> 07:43.493
Hey, Walt, I'm kind of
in the middle of something
right now.

07:43.528 --> 07:46.763
Oh, yes, you are.
So open the door.

07:46.797 --> 07:49.432
You're damn right you are.
You're right in the middle.

07:49.466 --> 07:52.100
Just open the door,
and let's talk about it, okay?

07:52.134 --> 07:55.369
Open the door, Ted, right now.

07:55.403 --> 07:57.404
All right, you don't want
to be a man about it? Okay.

07:57.438 --> 07:59.438
Plan B. How do you like that?
Plan B.

07:59.473 --> 08:01.773
Oh, dear God.

08:03.075 --> 08:04.708
Plan B!

08:06.310 --> 08:08.410
Walt. Walt.

08:08.445 --> 08:10.245
Walt.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.548
What are you doing?

08:12.583 --> 08:14.351
I'm talking with Ted.

08:18.790 --> 08:20.490
Oh, Jesus.

08:20.524 --> 08:22.759
Huh?

08:25.129 --> 08:30.998
Next time,
you'll open the door.

08:32.267 --> 08:35.001
Oh, damn it.

08:35.034 --> 08:38.037
I'm just here to talk.
I just want to talk to him.

08:38.071 --> 08:41.775
God. Can I just talk?
I just want to talk to him.

08:41.809 --> 08:43.812
I'm just talk--

08:43.846 --> 08:45.781
All right. All right,
all right, all right,
I'm calm.

08:45.815 --> 08:48.217
I'm calm.

08:51.253 --> 08:52.386
Fuck.

09:07.400 --> 09:08.767
Aah! Aah!

09:08.802 --> 09:10.969
What do you want?
What do you want?

09:11.004 --> 09:13.438
Hey! Hey, come on.

09:16.008 --> 09:18.009
What the hell
is wrong with you?

09:18.043 --> 09:20.177
You act like
you're the first guy
this ever happened to.

09:20.212 --> 09:24.347
I caught my second wife
screwing my stepdad, okay?

09:24.381 --> 09:27.616
It's a cruel world, Walt.
Grow up.

09:27.651 --> 09:29.818
I just wanted
to talk to him.

09:29.853 --> 09:31.953
Yeah, well,
now I'm talking to you.

09:31.988 --> 09:33.755
Consider this an intervention.

09:33.789 --> 09:36.324
You could have been
arrested back there.
You understand.

09:36.358 --> 09:38.159
I mean, speaking
as your lawyer,

09:38.193 --> 09:40.160
I'm always looking
for billable hours,

09:40.195 --> 09:42.529
but speaking
as your business associate,

09:42.563 --> 09:43.763
I'm strongly advising

09:43.798 --> 09:45.598
that you get your shit
together.

09:45.633 --> 09:49.635
Just cool it
with this Beneke guy,
at least for now.

09:49.669 --> 09:50.636
Okay?

09:52.138 --> 09:54.072
Let's talk shop

09:54.107 --> 09:56.040
because I think this is
a great opportunity

09:56.075 --> 09:58.376
to channel
some of that negative energy

09:58.410 --> 10:00.010
into something positive.

10:00.045 --> 10:01.778
How did you know?

10:01.813 --> 10:03.146
Sorry?

10:03.181 --> 10:04.547
About Skyler.

10:04.582 --> 10:06.115
About where to find me
just now.

10:06.150 --> 10:08.050
How did you know?

10:08.085 --> 10:09.918
That's
just my meticulousness.

10:09.953 --> 10:12.420
Don't bog down in detail,
Walt.

10:12.455 --> 10:13.488
The lesson here--

10:13.522 --> 10:15.390
Did you bug my house?

10:19.627 --> 10:22.995
Yeah, but I didn't know
it was your house, did I?
You had moved out.

10:23.030 --> 10:24.897
Besides,
you basically told me to.

10:24.931 --> 10:26.265
I told you to?

10:26.299 --> 10:28.100
You strongly hinted
that I should.

10:28.135 --> 10:30.502
You were worried
about your wife, remember?

10:30.537 --> 10:32.604
You were concerned
she might say something
to the police.

10:32.639 --> 10:34.740
What?
No, no, that's not true.

10:34.774 --> 10:37.075
When the hell
did I say that?

10:37.110 --> 10:40.012
Let's not get lost
in the who, what, and whens.

10:40.046 --> 10:43.015
The point is we did our
due diligence,

10:43.049 --> 10:44.516
and she didn't talk.

10:44.550 --> 10:45.517
She kept quiet.

10:45.552 --> 10:46.618
She stood by you, Walt,

10:46.653 --> 10:48.720
which, if you ask me,

10:48.755 --> 10:51.256
is the ironical
silver lining here.

10:51.291 --> 10:52.558
I mean, on the one hand,

10:52.592 --> 10:55.928
sure, she snuck off
the reservation

10:55.962 --> 10:57.630
to get some dirty,
damp, and deep.

10:57.664 --> 10:59.565
On the other hand--

11:15.144 --> 11:18.145
You're fired!
You're done!

11:18.180 --> 11:20.948
Good. Oh, boo-hoo,
I won't cook meth anymore.

11:20.982 --> 11:22.849
You're a crybaby.
Who needs you?

11:22.883 --> 11:25.550
Hey, I'm unplugging
the Web site,
so no more money laundering.

11:25.584 --> 11:26.784
How do you like that?

11:26.818 --> 11:29.819
I want those bugs
out of my house today.

11:29.853 --> 11:31.687
I want them out now!

11:31.721 --> 11:35.423
Oh, you just bought
a $300 suit, psycho!

11:37.492 --> 11:39.059
Door.

11:44.897 --> 11:47.531
Great, drilled
right into the stucco.

11:47.565 --> 11:51.797
Oh, a little bit of putty,

11:51.831 --> 11:54.464
you'll be fine.

11:54.498 --> 11:57.232
Just make sure you get
all of those things.

11:57.267 --> 12:01.536
A, these things
cost $800 apiece.

12:01.570 --> 12:03.371
B, you're not
that interesting.

12:03.405 --> 12:05.973
So yeah,
I'll get all of them, Walter.

12:07.108 --> 12:10.011
Great line of work,
by the way.

12:10.045 --> 12:12.179
Real upstanding field.

12:12.214 --> 12:14.214
Yep, well...

12:15.815 --> 12:17.449
I enjoy it.

12:26.656 --> 12:30.059
You're free to leave now.
Anytime.

12:31.628 --> 12:34.796
You know, Walter,

12:34.831 --> 12:36.297
sometimes it doesn't hurt

12:36.331 --> 12:38.499
to have someone
watching your back.

13:56.755 --> 13:58.855
Mr. White?

14:04.396 --> 14:05.763
Hi.

14:07.866 --> 14:09.833
What's up?

14:12.536 --> 14:15.237
I can't begin to understand

14:15.272 --> 14:17.306
what you're going through,
Walt,

14:17.340 --> 14:19.107
with all
of your health concerns

14:19.141 --> 14:22.577
and the stresses
you've been under.

14:22.611 --> 14:24.644
Still, as educators,

14:24.679 --> 14:26.379
there are certain
responsibilities

14:26.414 --> 14:28.380
we need to be meeting here

14:28.415 --> 14:31.583
to the school
and to the students themselves.

14:31.617 --> 14:33.650
Yeah, of course.

14:35.353 --> 14:38.053
Is this a Wheaten terrier?

14:38.087 --> 14:42.155
Uh, Norfolk.

14:42.189 --> 14:43.688
Norfolk?

14:43.723 --> 14:47.157
That's surprising.

14:47.191 --> 14:49.525
Walt, could you
come back over here

14:49.560 --> 14:51.096
and have a seat, please?

14:51.130 --> 14:53.033
Sure.

15:05.110 --> 15:08.044
You've been absent a lot
recently,

15:08.078 --> 15:10.778
and when you are here
at school,

15:10.813 --> 15:13.247
there have been
some behavioral questions,

15:13.281 --> 15:15.115
and frankly I'm concerned.

15:17.688 --> 15:20.256
Hm. Thank you.

15:29.465 --> 15:31.133
Are you feeling okay?

15:31.167 --> 15:35.404
And do you think maybe
I should call Skyler?

15:35.438 --> 15:38.173
Um...nah.

15:43.979 --> 15:48.748
Let's just keep this...

15:48.783 --> 15:50.416
What?

15:52.618 --> 15:53.885
Hey!

15:55.420 --> 15:57.154
Walt, what's wrong with you?

16:38.996 --> 16:40.393
You know, look,

16:40.427 --> 16:43.296
you're the one who was
talking about D.C., okay?

16:43.330 --> 16:45.098
This is how you get there.

16:45.132 --> 16:47.532
You answer the bell.
You pay your dues.

16:51.202 --> 16:52.569
Besides, it's-- you know,

16:52.603 --> 16:55.372
it's a big deal
to get picked for this.

16:57.209 --> 17:00.344
El Paso's like the Super Bowl.

17:02.614 --> 17:06.416
I could get killed crossing
the street, okay? Whatever.

17:06.452 --> 17:09.554
I want to go.

17:09.588 --> 17:11.255
What about last time?

17:11.289 --> 17:12.690
What about last time?

17:36.615 --> 17:37.749
Schrader.

17:38.751 --> 17:40.585
Hey, Sheriff. Yeah.

17:42.888 --> 17:44.723
Blue, huh?

17:46.859 --> 17:48.360
Yeah, yeah.

17:48.394 --> 17:50.862
Thing is, uh--

17:50.897 --> 17:52.864
Thing is I'm supposed to be
getting on a plane right now.

17:58.805 --> 18:00.105
The stuff this guy had
was blue.

18:00.140 --> 18:01.974
You sure about that?

18:04.778 --> 18:06.211
Yeah.

18:07.714 --> 18:08.948
Yeah, I want to talk to him.

18:12.753 --> 18:14.220
Taxi.

18:53.826 --> 18:54.926
Hi.

18:54.960 --> 18:56.427
Man, I'm sorry.
I needed to talk to you,

18:56.462 --> 18:59.230
but you weren't at your
apartment.

18:59.264 --> 19:02.199
No, I moved back home.

19:02.234 --> 19:03.667
That's good, right?

19:04.669 --> 19:05.836
Yeah.

19:05.870 --> 19:08.572
Yo, did you just get fired?

19:08.606 --> 19:13.042
No. No, no, no, it's, uh...

19:13.077 --> 19:14.410
more like a sabbatical.

19:14.445 --> 19:17.547
Indefinite. Yeah.

19:17.581 --> 19:19.315
Oh.

19:20.483 --> 19:22.217
Uh...

19:31.595 --> 19:35.264
So what's up?

19:35.299 --> 19:38.501
Uh, should we go somewhere?

19:38.535 --> 19:40.703
No. This is fine.

19:42.406 --> 19:46.809
So, um, I want an intro
to your guy.

19:46.843 --> 19:47.976
What guy?

19:49.679 --> 19:51.846
Your guy.
Your distribution guy,

19:51.881 --> 19:53.181
The guy
Saul hooked you up with.

19:53.215 --> 19:55.814
No, no, no, no, no.
Come on, Jesse.

19:55.849 --> 19:59.281
I thought about it,
and I want to.

19:59.316 --> 20:01.915
It's the one thing
I'm good at.

20:01.950 --> 20:04.782
No, that is just not true.

20:04.817 --> 20:07.583
You're good
at a lot of things, son.

20:07.617 --> 20:08.950
Like what?

20:12.085 --> 20:13.884
What about your sobriety?

20:14.919 --> 20:17.851
I told you. I'm not using.

20:17.885 --> 20:22.717
Ever. I just want
back into the business.

20:27.221 --> 20:29.560
Well, I don't.

20:29.594 --> 20:31.294
I'm sorry.

20:31.329 --> 20:33.393
I know, and that's cool.

20:33.428 --> 20:36.834
I'm not asking you to cook.

20:39.282 --> 20:41.516
What's this?

20:41.550 --> 20:46.287
In the end, I just went
with two reflux condensers.

20:46.321 --> 20:48.689
I didn't want to lose track
of my Ph levels,

20:48.724 --> 20:51.359
but I did everything else
just like you taught

20:51.393 --> 20:53.361
me.

20:54.896 --> 20:56.564
Super careful in my amounts

20:56.598 --> 20:59.266
and watched the numbers
every step of the way.

21:00.901 --> 21:02.802
So what do you think?

21:02.836 --> 21:04.503
It's good, right?

21:06.973 --> 21:11.809
What in the hell is this?

21:13.078 --> 21:14.378
What?

21:14.413 --> 21:16.580
What? This. This.

21:16.614 --> 21:18.515
This is my product.

21:18.549 --> 21:19.649
This is my formula.

21:19.683 --> 21:21.217
This is mine.

21:21.251 --> 21:24.352
Okay, it's our product,

21:24.387 --> 21:26.020
but yeah,
I was going to cut you in.

21:26.055 --> 21:27.522
You were going to cut me in?

21:27.556 --> 21:29.823
No, no, no. I cut you in.

21:29.857 --> 21:31.358
What the hell is your problem?

21:31.392 --> 21:34.193
All I'm asking
is for you to set a meet.

21:34.227 --> 21:35.461
Absolutely not.

21:35.495 --> 21:36.928
Why?

21:39.465 --> 21:41.332
Because I am not
going to lend my name

21:41.366 --> 21:42.466
to an inferior product.

21:42.500 --> 21:44.867
I mean,
look at the diameters here.

21:44.902 --> 21:46.736
What did you use for reduction?

21:46.770 --> 21:49.871
Don't tell me.
Platinum dioxide, right?

21:49.906 --> 21:53.241
No. Mercury-aluminum
amalgam.

21:53.275 --> 21:55.476
The dioxide's
too hard to keep wet.

21:55.511 --> 21:59.045
All right, well, you must've
done it wrong, then.

21:59.080 --> 22:00.880
Your color is all cloudy,

22:00.915 --> 22:03.116
so you were struggling
with distillation, too.

22:03.150 --> 22:06.051
Now, this is very shoddy work,
Pinkman.

22:06.086 --> 22:07.953
I'm actually
embarrassed for you.

22:07.987 --> 22:10.555
What?

22:10.589 --> 22:12.890
No way.
I gave out samples,

22:12.924 --> 22:14.458
and everyone said
it was the bomb.

22:15.593 --> 22:18.227
Oh, they said it was the bomb.

22:18.261 --> 22:20.129
And who are they? I wonder.

22:20.163 --> 22:21.530
Huh? A bunch of meth heads?

22:21.564 --> 22:23.098
Yeah.
Yeah.

22:23.132 --> 22:24.332
They should know, right?

22:24.367 --> 22:25.366
Yeah, well, sorry.

22:25.401 --> 22:26.467
I can't help you.

22:26.502 --> 22:27.802
Fine, asswad.

22:27.836 --> 22:29.904
You know what?
I'll contact the guy myself.

22:29.938 --> 22:32.739
Oh, yeah? Good luck with that
because my guy is a pro,

22:32.773 --> 22:34.440
and he doesn't deal
with junkies.

22:34.474 --> 22:35.972
You know what? Eat me.

22:36.006 --> 22:39.306
Anytime, loser. Hey. Hey!

22:39.340 --> 22:40.907
Hey. Hey!

23:19.328 --> 23:21.363
I can't believe
it's only 4:00.

23:22.998 --> 23:25.366
This day is dragging.

23:28.402 --> 23:29.702
Mm.

24:03.972 --> 24:05.608
I wish I could stay.

24:06.715 --> 24:08.118
So stay.

24:11.690 --> 24:13.657
What's stopping you?

24:16.093 --> 24:19.295
What? Like everything,
you mean?

24:19.329 --> 24:24.699
How about my lunatic husband
refusing to leave the house?

24:24.734 --> 24:26.267
Ahem.

24:26.302 --> 24:28.802
So move in here.

24:28.837 --> 24:33.005
And then my son
hating me even more.

24:33.039 --> 24:34.806
Nah.

24:34.840 --> 24:36.073
It'll pass.

24:36.108 --> 24:37.808
I went through that
with the girls.

24:37.842 --> 24:39.676
They adapt.

24:39.711 --> 24:41.445
And now everyone at work

24:41.480 --> 24:44.415
thinks I'm an evil,
ladder-climbing whore.

24:44.450 --> 24:45.783
They're all fired
effective immediately.

24:47.186 --> 24:48.219
What else?

24:50.355 --> 24:52.823
Oh, aren't you the answer man.

24:56.995 --> 24:58.830
Where did it--

25:02.135 --> 25:03.669
Where did it go wrong,
exactly--

25:03.703 --> 25:05.804
you and Walt?

25:10.044 --> 25:12.749
I mean, I always saw him
as kind of...

25:15.953 --> 25:17.253
mild-mannered.

25:18.788 --> 25:21.792
Something, I don't know,
change when he got sick,
or...?

25:24.530 --> 25:27.398
I don't know what changed,
Ted,

25:27.432 --> 25:30.968
and I just don't feel
really comfortable
talking about it.

25:31.002 --> 25:32.903
Sorry.

25:34.338 --> 25:36.638
Just asking
out of self-interest.

25:36.672 --> 25:38.539
Got to make sure I don't
make the same mistake.

25:41.342 --> 25:43.542
I would be amazed.

25:46.345 --> 25:49.013
Just let me see if I'm
following you here, Russell.

25:49.048 --> 25:54.152
You got this stuff
from some guy at Gasparza's

25:54.186 --> 25:55.820
who was wearing tan pants

25:55.854 --> 25:58.288
and who you're 80% sure

25:58.323 --> 26:00.492
had a mustache.

26:00.527 --> 26:01.962
That's it, right?

26:01.997 --> 26:04.933
That's your brain
working at maximum capacity?

26:12.440 --> 26:13.707
Russell.

26:15.209 --> 26:16.743
Everything all right
in there?

26:19.047 --> 26:22.616
Mel.
The dude's name was Mel.

26:22.650 --> 26:24.951
Well, there you go. See?

26:24.985 --> 26:27.520
You served
an actual earthly function.

26:27.554 --> 26:29.521
I can't believe
I remembered that.

26:29.556 --> 26:31.123
Mel who?

26:31.157 --> 26:33.859
Does he have a last name?

26:33.893 --> 26:35.960
Yeah, uh, Mel.

26:37.596 --> 26:39.063
Wait.

26:40.398 --> 26:41.665
Was it Mel?

26:41.699 --> 26:44.267
Um...Mark.

26:45.603 --> 26:47.637
It was definitely an "M" name.

26:47.671 --> 26:49.739
Oh, man, I'm losing it.

26:49.773 --> 26:51.674
Wait, wait.

26:54.311 --> 26:55.310
Yeah.

26:56.643 --> 26:58.376
It's gone.

26:59.675 --> 27:00.908
It's gone.

27:00.942 --> 27:03.141
It was an "M" name,
though.

27:03.175 --> 27:06.040
I remember the "muh" sound.

27:06.075 --> 27:08.174
Oh. Huh?

27:08.208 --> 27:11.907
We'll go with the "muh" sound.

27:11.941 --> 27:12.908
Thanks a lot.

27:12.942 --> 27:13.908
Yeah.
Appreciate it.

27:13.943 --> 27:16.110
He definitely had tan pants.

27:19.481 --> 27:21.347
Remind me to get a vasectomy.

27:21.382 --> 27:22.815
Okay, it's after 9,

27:22.850 --> 27:24.650
so this bar
that Girl George is at,

27:24.685 --> 27:26.752
probably wall-to-wall
dirtbags by now.

27:26.786 --> 27:28.320
Let's go have
a little looky-loo,

27:28.355 --> 27:31.423
see if we can't find
this M-named clown.

27:35.360 --> 27:36.627
What?

27:36.661 --> 27:37.928
It's a lead.

27:37.963 --> 27:39.363
Lead to what?

27:39.397 --> 27:40.998
To Heisenberg.

27:41.032 --> 27:42.432
I told you it was only
a matter of time

27:42.466 --> 27:44.567
before this guy
booted up again.

27:44.601 --> 27:46.835
Here we go, my friend.

27:46.870 --> 27:48.837
Don't hate me
because I'm beautiful, Gomie.

27:48.871 --> 27:50.939
Just apologize
and buy me a beer.

27:53.041 --> 27:55.042
Man, you're reaching.

27:55.076 --> 27:56.710
This stuff
could be a knockoff

27:56.744 --> 27:59.346
or left over
from an older cook.

27:59.380 --> 28:01.314
How do you know Heisenberg's
gearing up again?

28:03.016 --> 28:05.250
How do I know?

28:05.284 --> 28:06.784
Because I know.

28:07.852 --> 28:09.452
I don't get it.

28:09.487 --> 28:12.955
This is the reason
why you're blowing off
the task force?

28:12.989 --> 28:14.256
Chase down teeners?

28:15.792 --> 28:18.993
I'm getting tired
of all the second guessing.

28:19.028 --> 28:22.729
If you're not
sufficiently stimulated
by this investigation,

28:22.764 --> 28:25.098
do us both a favor
and ask for a transfer.

28:25.132 --> 28:27.733
What is up with you lately?

28:27.767 --> 28:29.668
Starting bar fights?

28:29.702 --> 28:31.637
Turning down El Paso?

28:31.671 --> 28:33.105
And now this bullshit?

28:33.139 --> 28:35.474
Do you need to talk
to someone or what?

28:36.776 --> 28:39.243
Talk to someone?

28:39.278 --> 28:40.677
Talk to who?

28:44.648 --> 28:48.883
I'm not trying to step
on your toes, bro. Okay?

28:48.918 --> 28:51.518
I'm just worried about you.
That's all.

28:51.553 --> 28:54.153
Appreciate that...bro.

28:55.855 --> 28:58.256
Now take your hand
off my shoulder.

29:12.799 --> 29:14.700
Yeah, yeah,
the one that was on TV.

29:14.734 --> 29:18.069
Did any little piece
fall on your property?

29:18.104 --> 29:21.338
I'm not looking
for an entire wing here,
Mr. Linkas.

29:21.373 --> 29:22.873
It could be a nut or a bolt.

29:22.907 --> 29:24.607
It could be a bag of peanuts,

29:24.641 --> 29:27.709
just so long as it caused you
pain and suffering.

29:27.743 --> 29:29.277
Oh, no, no, no. Closed.

29:29.311 --> 29:30.344
Uh, calling you back.

29:30.378 --> 29:32.345
You had your chance.

29:32.380 --> 29:33.980
I told you to get him
cooking again,

29:34.014 --> 29:35.581
and you blew it off,
and now it's too late.

29:35.616 --> 29:37.951
The guy's gone
mass maniac on us!

29:37.985 --> 29:40.586
All I wanted was to show
you two your potential,

29:40.620 --> 29:41.887
and what do I get in return?

29:41.921 --> 29:44.389
A bone contusion.
You want to see the scar?

29:44.424 --> 29:46.290
I wish you two had--

29:46.325 --> 29:48.159
Hi, there.

29:49.661 --> 29:51.028
How in the hell
did you get Walt to--

29:51.063 --> 29:52.964
I made it.

29:52.998 --> 29:56.401
You know the guy
who knows the guy, right?

30:29.467 --> 30:33.169
Uh, good news is,
for a stage three cancer,

30:33.203 --> 30:35.538
the guy's doing well
physically.

30:35.573 --> 30:36.572
Mentally,

30:36.607 --> 30:38.141
the guy's a disaster.

30:38.175 --> 30:39.375
He's gone off the rails

30:39.410 --> 30:41.777
over this thing
with his wife.

30:41.812 --> 30:44.613
My opinion,
he's not coming back,

30:44.648 --> 30:46.748
not on his own.

30:50.352 --> 30:53.754
Your friends were
at his place again,
by the way.

30:53.788 --> 30:56.358
They drew something
on the street
outside his house.

30:57.663 --> 30:59.097
The scythe.

30:59.132 --> 31:01.468
Animals.

31:01.502 --> 31:02.971
Does the lawyer know?
Should he?

31:03.006 --> 31:04.574
No.

31:06.980 --> 31:09.349
If you want this guy
to produce again,

31:09.384 --> 31:10.952
why not just tell him?

31:10.986 --> 31:12.086
You're the only thing

31:12.121 --> 31:13.754
that stands between him
and an ax in the head.

31:13.788 --> 31:16.089
I don't believe fear to be
an effective motivator.

31:16.123 --> 31:18.324
I want investment.

31:18.358 --> 31:22.227
For now, I'm simply
interested in time frame.

31:22.261 --> 31:24.596
He will live for the
foreseeable future, yes?

31:24.630 --> 31:26.564
Mm, foreseeable,

31:26.598 --> 31:27.598
couple years at least,

31:27.632 --> 31:30.834
barring acts of G--
and men with axes.

31:30.868 --> 31:33.636
Oh, from the lawyer,

31:33.671 --> 31:35.138
I'm supposed to let you know

31:35.172 --> 31:37.773
the Pinkman kid
is looking to sell.

31:37.807 --> 31:39.608
I don't work with junkies.

31:39.642 --> 31:41.543
That's what I thought
you'd say.

31:41.578 --> 31:43.578
Probably for the best.

31:43.613 --> 31:46.047
What I hear,
he and Walter are splitsville.

31:48.083 --> 31:49.150
Really?

31:49.184 --> 31:50.617
That's what Goodman says.

31:50.652 --> 31:52.752
Cats and dogs.

31:54.721 --> 31:56.221
Do the deal.

31:57.357 --> 31:59.324
Mm.

32:01.126 --> 32:02.693
Hm.

33:22.903 --> 33:25.037
<i>You have one unheard message.</i>

33:26.021 --> 33:30.524
<i>Agent Schrader,
you need to be calling
me back ASAP. Clear?</i>

33:30.558 --> 33:32.893
<i>I've got Texas
breathing down my neck,
and I'm not about--</i>

33:55.747 --> 33:57.347
Yeah, I haven't see Matt

33:59.750 --> 34:01.550
Where can I find him,
you think?

34:01.584 --> 34:03.551
No idea.
I haven't seen him--

34:03.586 --> 34:05.086
I know.
You said that a few times.

34:05.120 --> 34:07.055
Yeah, because
I haven't seen him.

34:07.089 --> 34:08.589
I don't know
what else to say.

34:13.328 --> 34:15.262
What's your name, darling?

34:15.295 --> 34:16.829
Cara.

34:22.935 --> 34:24.601
Where did this come from,
Cara?

34:26.103 --> 34:27.638
I-- I don't know.

34:28.806 --> 34:30.908
What is it? Drugs?

34:34.012 --> 34:35.980
Look, I'm just going to come
right out and say it.

34:36.014 --> 34:40.085
Um, you're a bad liar, Cara.

34:40.119 --> 34:42.420
Don't get me wrong.

34:42.455 --> 34:44.089
Not the worst I've ever seen.

34:45.391 --> 34:49.161
Once had a guy try to explain
the dope balloon up his butt

34:49.195 --> 34:50.495
on bad Thai food.

34:50.530 --> 34:54.297
Still, you're not
a very good liar.

34:56.101 --> 34:57.301
I honestly don't know

34:57.336 --> 34:59.136
Stop.

34:59.171 --> 35:01.238
You look like a good kid.

35:01.273 --> 35:02.673
I'm not here
to get you in trouble,

35:02.707 --> 35:05.876
but you need to tell me
where this came from
right now!

35:10.114 --> 35:13.517
I never do stuff like this.
I swear to God.

35:15.320 --> 35:18.422
I tried it, and I hated it,
so I just gave it to Matt.

35:18.456 --> 35:19.790
Okay, and who gave it to you?

35:19.824 --> 35:22.225
Some guy, he came in
a couple days ago

35:22.259 --> 35:24.861
and wanted to trade it
for gas.

35:24.895 --> 35:26.796
Some guy?
W-What's his name?

35:28.465 --> 35:30.132
Okay, w--

35:30.166 --> 35:31.401
What did he look like?

35:33.337 --> 35:36.106
I don't know. Um--

35:36.140 --> 35:38.241
He looked pretty normal.

35:38.276 --> 35:42.345
You know? Um, white--

35:42.380 --> 35:43.547
um...

35:43.581 --> 35:48.050
I think his hair
was lightish brown.

35:48.084 --> 35:50.686
He had really blue eyes.

35:50.720 --> 35:54.222
They were really,
really blue.

35:54.257 --> 35:56.858
He's dreamy.
Okay, w-w-what else?

35:56.892 --> 35:58.560
Piercings,ewelry,

35:58.594 --> 36:00.127
distinctive articles
of clothing?

36:00.162 --> 36:01.863
Come on.

36:01.897 --> 36:03.430
Come on.

36:05.033 --> 36:06.534
Listen to me.

36:08.270 --> 36:13.840
It's real important
that I find the person
that had these drugs,

36:13.875 --> 36:18.646
so if you can remember
anything elsabout him...

36:18.680 --> 36:20.714
Come on.

36:22.817 --> 36:25.319
He drove an RV.

36:25.353 --> 36:26.620
Okay, good, good.

36:26.655 --> 36:29.019
What can you remember?
What kind of RV?

36:29.053 --> 36:31.188
What color?
Did you spot a license plate?

36:32.490 --> 36:34.758
I don't knot the kinds,

36:34.793 --> 36:38.495
and I didn't see the license,

36:38.530 --> 36:43.434
but the color was, I think,
white, brownish color.

36:45.704 --> 36:48.239
I'm sorry.

36:48.273 --> 36:52.109
I know I'm not helping you,
but...

36:52.143 --> 36:54.811
Please don't tell my dad.

37:04.178 --> 37:05.411
Cara.

37:07.580 --> 37:11.243
Please tell me
that that camera works.

37:25.953 --> 37:27.320
Damn it.

38:24.350 --> 38:26.017
Bingo.

38:46.100 --> 38:48.701
These eggs are good,
Mom.

38:48.736 --> 38:50.436
Thanks.

38:52.438 --> 38:54.038
Hey,
you know what's weird?

38:54.072 --> 38:55.739
Dad's Web site.

38:55.773 --> 38:58.808
It's been three days
since the last donation.

39:00.810 --> 39:03.878
Yeah, well...

39:03.912 --> 39:06.413
people lose interest.

39:16.687 --> 39:17.753
Um...

39:19.956 --> 39:22.590
So how long
are you off for?

39:27.160 --> 39:29.394
A few weeks.

39:29.428 --> 39:31.529
Uh, we'll play it by ear.

39:34.865 --> 39:38.833
I probably...
pushed it, you know,

39:38.868 --> 39:40.634
going back to work so soon.

39:49.508 --> 39:51.775
Think-- Think
I can get a ride today?

39:51.810 --> 39:53.910
Louis has
a doctor's appointment.

39:56.046 --> 39:58.347
Uh...yeah.

40:02.818 --> 40:07.520
Hey, so Dad can
babysit now. Right?

40:08.922 --> 40:12.691
You won't have to take
Holly to work every day.

40:21.498 --> 40:23.865
Sometime, maybe.

40:26.302 --> 40:27.737
We'll see.

41:10.551 --> 41:11.886
What's up?

41:16.894 --> 41:19.394
I think you'll
seriously enjoy, yo.

41:34.473 --> 41:35.506
Wait.

41:36.508 --> 41:38.075
No, no.

41:38.110 --> 41:39.743
No. Wait.

41:41.547 --> 41:42.981
Hey!

41:44.116 --> 41:45.183
Hey!

41:46.819 --> 41:48.320
Hey.

41:48.354 --> 41:51.292
What the hell?
This is only half.

41:51.326 --> 41:53.595
That's right.
It's your half.

41:56.467 --> 41:57.435
Yo!

41:57.469 --> 42:00.141
Where's the other half,
bitch?

42:01.278 --> 42:03.114
I mean, it was, uh--
--

42:03.148 --> 42:04.916
The whole thing
was crazy, man.

42:04.951 --> 42:06.384
Poor bastard.
I felt sorry for him.

42:06.418 --> 42:09.887
He actually thought we were
the cable guys, you know?

42:11.890 --> 42:13.923
Anyway, uh, um,

42:13.957 --> 42:16.058
sorry about those miscalls,
Chief.

42:16.092 --> 42:18.426
I'm changing providers.
It won't happen again.

42:20.061 --> 42:22.429
Are you going
to El Paso, Hank?

42:22.463 --> 42:23.797
Hell, yes!

42:23.831 --> 42:25.932
With pointed boots
and bells on.

42:25.966 --> 42:28.200
Just I got this break
in the Heisenberg case.

42:28.235 --> 42:29.501
The blue meth,
you mean?

42:29.536 --> 42:30.969
The teenth?

42:31.004 --> 42:33.805
Yeah, well, that teenth
got things rolling.

42:33.839 --> 42:35.673
I traced it
to a gas station in Cibola.

42:35.707 --> 42:36.974
That's where I got these.

42:37.008 --> 42:40.110
Now, the station's, uh,
closed circuit, uh, was down--

42:40.144 --> 42:41.278
surprise, surprise--

42:41.312 --> 42:43.847
but I was able to pull
some of these snapshots

42:43.881 --> 42:46.248
off an ATM security camera.

42:46.283 --> 42:47.516
Hey, now, I always thought

42:47.550 --> 42:48.983
these guys might be
camper cooking, right?

42:49.018 --> 42:51.852
First off, your typical
Class C motor home

42:51.887 --> 42:53.854
is going to grunt
at least 5,000 pounds

42:53.888 --> 42:55.088
of interior fixtures, okay?

42:55.123 --> 42:56.623
We're talking appliances,
furniture, built-ins.

42:56.657 --> 42:58.458
5,000 pounds at least, okay?

42:58.492 --> 43:01.293
See how high that
suspension's riding?

43:01.328 --> 43:04.996
No way, no how, this thing's
carrying that kind of weight.

43:05.031 --> 43:07.298
I mean, this thing
has been cleared out

43:07.332 --> 43:09.166
and stripped down
to its tight and curlies.

43:09.200 --> 43:10.601
For what?

43:10.635 --> 43:12.535
Blood bank?

43:12.570 --> 43:15.571
Maybe a bookmobile?

43:15.606 --> 43:18.507
There's no clear view
of the plates.

43:18.542 --> 43:21.176
Yeah, well, you can only
get so lucky, right?

43:21.211 --> 43:23.345
But the fact that there's
no front plate

43:23.379 --> 43:25.147
tells me its likely
New Mexico registration.

43:25.181 --> 43:26.614
I checked with DMV.

43:26.649 --> 43:29.116
There are only 29
of these early '80s Bounders

43:29.151 --> 43:30.451
registered in the state.

43:33.087 --> 43:34.821
Only 29?

43:34.855 --> 43:36.055
Yeah.

43:36.090 --> 43:39.091
So I got to go, uh,
you know, knock on some doors.

43:47.299 --> 43:49.299
They need you
in El Paso, Hank.

43:49.334 --> 43:51.034
You bet. I-- I--

43:51.069 --> 43:53.203
I'm just going to wrap up
this Heisenberg thing first.

43:53.237 --> 43:55.071
So you're refusing
the assignment.

43:55.105 --> 43:56.172
No, I'm not. I'll go.

43:56.206 --> 43:58.374
It's just
I need some more time.

43:58.408 --> 44:00.842
You're not hearing me,
Agent Schrader.

44:00.877 --> 44:02.977
You're out of time.

44:03.012 --> 44:08.549
Are you going to El Paso
now? Tonight?

44:12.253 --> 44:14.420
Just a simple yes or no.

44:21.327 --> 44:22.527
No.

44:24.463 --> 44:25.663
I can't.

44:28.666 --> 44:31.768
But that's only because

44:31.802 --> 44:33.870
I'm really close
to something big here.

44:44.579 --> 44:46.747
Better get to it, then.

45:10.867 --> 45:14.636
<i>This is KECA 480,
Albuquerque news radio.</i>

45:14.670 --> 45:17.038
<i>KECA news time 10:13.</i>

45:17.072 --> 45:18.439
<i>Our top story this hour--</i>

45:18.473 --> 45:20.741
<i>Donald Margolis,
the air traffic controller</i>

45:20.775 --> 45:23.376

45:31.417 --> 45:32.984

46:23.695 --> 46:24.928
Your half.

46:37.874 --> 46:40.308
