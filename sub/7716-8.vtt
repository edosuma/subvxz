WEBVTT

00:01.336 --> 00:04.381
The Sabre Code of Conduct
outlines the governing principles

00:04.631 --> 00:08.968
key to establishing and maintaining
trust with our employees, clients...

00:09.052 --> 00:10.720
Oh, my God, kill me.

00:10.804 --> 00:13.973
Hey. All right, obviously,
we all want to die,

00:14.057 --> 00:18.853
but we have to get through this,
so Gabe, go ahead. It's okay.

00:19.229 --> 00:21.314
Oh, is it...
Is it okay with you?

00:21.439 --> 00:23.566
Because if it's not,
you work for me, so...

00:23.858 --> 00:25.151
Comply with all
applicable laws,

00:25.276 --> 00:26.611
regulations,
policies and contracts

00:26.695 --> 00:27.779
governing our business.

00:28.071 --> 00:29.197
Be honest, fair...
I'm going to do it.

00:29.280 --> 00:32.283
...trustworthy in all your business
activities and relationships.

00:32.784 --> 00:35.203
Treat one another...
Oh! I'm going into labor!

00:35.787 --> 00:37.080
Okay. She's going into labor!
Oh, my goodness.

00:37.163 --> 00:38.164
Make way, everybody!

00:38.498 --> 00:40.500
I know it's wrong to
fake going into labor

00:40.625 --> 00:42.669
just to get out of things,
but sometimes,

00:42.877 --> 00:43.920
it's necessary.

00:44.421 --> 00:45.422
I'm going into labor.

00:45.505 --> 00:47.048
But should I
have corn dogs or...

00:47.173 --> 00:48.758
I'm going into labor!

00:48.925 --> 00:50.802
Okay, three reasons you are
wrong about True Blood.

00:51.261 --> 00:53.138
Number one...
I'm going into labor.

00:56.141 --> 00:57.183
Here we go!

00:57.267 --> 01:00.395
Hey, guys, you can't keep
saying you're going into labor.

01:00.478 --> 01:01.563
Everyone knows
you're full of it.

01:01.938 --> 01:03.064
Yeah. It's
not fair, you guys.

01:03.148 --> 01:04.149
- Pitiful.
- So stupid.

01:04.983 --> 01:05.984
Never cry wolf.

01:06.192 --> 01:07.861
Okay-
Okay-

01:09.320 --> 01:11.197
Oh. Oh! Oh, my gosh!

01:11.322 --> 01:13.241
Oh, my God, Pam!

01:13.324 --> 01:15.952
I'm really in labor!
This is happening.

01:16.035 --> 01:17.287
Okay, guys-
Okay.

01:17.370 --> 01:18.580
Here we go.
We'll see you.

01:19.330 --> 01:20.331
How do you feel?

01:20.498 --> 01:21.958
Drive carefully!
Good luck!

01:22.041 --> 01:23.710
- Bye!
- Good luck!

01:28.381 --> 01:29.716
False alarm.

01:51.321 --> 01:55.033
What? They took
another client from us?

01:55.700 --> 01:56.701
Okay, bye.

01:58.536 --> 02:01.748
Man, business is war.

02:03.208 --> 02:05.502
Customers, clients,
it's like a war out there.

02:06.002 --> 02:07.545
I am a leader,

02:08.546 --> 02:12.008
but you can only inspire people
so much in a place like this.

02:12.675 --> 02:16.221
So today, I'm turning
the inspire factor up to 10.

02:16.304 --> 02:20.016
With a little help from my friend,
America's bloodiest battle.

02:21.726 --> 02:25.271
Why even read business books?
We should be studying war.

02:25.355 --> 02:27.565
Going to places like Gettysburg.
Where is that?

02:27.899 --> 02:28.900
It's right here in PA.

02:30.276 --> 02:31.277
Ah!

02:31.861 --> 02:36.241
Well, we should take a field trip there.
I mean, that would be so cool.

02:36.324 --> 02:37.700
I wonder if that
bus downstairs is...

02:37.784 --> 02:40.411
Okay, Andy. We get it.
It's a trip to Gettysburg.

02:40.620 --> 02:43.081
That sounds super inspiring!
I'm in!

02:43.164 --> 02:44.916
Gettysburg? Hmm.
Could be interesting.

02:45.083 --> 02:46.835
Second most northern
battle in the Civil War.

02:46.918 --> 02:49.629
Actually, it is
the northernmost.

02:49.963 --> 02:51.005
Ha!

02:51.089 --> 02:53.424
The Civil War history industry

02:53.508 --> 02:57.178
has conveniently forgotten about
the Battle of Schrute Farms.

02:57.554 --> 03:01.766
Whatever. I'm over it.
It's just grossly irresponsible.

03:02.267 --> 03:03.768
Charge!

03:04.227 --> 03:05.937
Well, this could be fun.

03:06.479 --> 03:08.439
Yeah, well, the bus
has free Wi-Fi,

03:08.606 --> 03:12.277
and I made special low sugar
lunches for everyone.

03:12.402 --> 03:14.696
And is anyone
kosher or halal?

03:14.779 --> 03:15.738
What's the halal option?

03:15.822 --> 03:18.616
Dates, tabouleh
and bagel with cream cheese.

03:18.741 --> 03:19.742
Out.

03:19.826 --> 03:23.580
You know, it's the same as the kosher option.
There's a lesson in there.

03:24.122 --> 03:26.833
I mean, I can't force you to
go, you're not my slaves.

03:26.916 --> 03:28.710
Thanks to Gettysburg.

03:28.793 --> 03:30.253
But who's coming with me?

03:30.670 --> 03:32.380
I'm in.
I'm in, too.

03:33.965 --> 03:37.135
I guess I'm a sucker
for historical fiction.

03:37.427 --> 03:39.387
Anyone who's not going,
you're dead to me.

03:39.512 --> 03:41.472
You're uninvited.
I don't want you to come.

03:41.764 --> 03:44.017
But FYI,
there will be leftover

03:44.100 --> 03:45.894
turkey and pesto
sammies in the fridge.

03:45.977 --> 03:46.978
Yes!

03:47.353 --> 03:49.063
One for you.
Cool, thanks.

03:49.147 --> 03:50.356
And one for you.

03:50.481 --> 03:51.733
Cool, thanks.

03:51.816 --> 03:55.194
Oh! You missed your head.
There you go.

03:55.486 --> 03:56.571
Phyllis, think fast!

03:58.489 --> 04:01.367
All right, guys, a little
foreplay before we do it.

04:01.659 --> 04:05.747
Fans of Ken Burns' Jazz will most
certainly enjoy The Civil War.

04:05.830 --> 04:07.373
You know, I just got
Limitless on my iPad.

04:07.498 --> 04:09.083
I bet I could
get it on the TV.

04:09.167 --> 04:12.337
Oh, isn't that the one where
the guy becomes limitless?

04:12.420 --> 04:15.423
It's just not appropriate. If we were going
to visit Bradley Cooper's birthplace,

04:15.506 --> 04:17.342
I'd be the first one suggesting that.
I'd be rooting for it...

04:17.425 --> 04:20.803
Limitless, Limitless,
Limitless, Limitless, Limitless!

04:20.887 --> 04:22.305
All right,
all right, all right!

04:24.349 --> 04:25.350
Here.

04:25.683 --> 04:27.685
Like it? Oh,
by the picnic table?

04:27.769 --> 04:29.354
Then you've got to
get the fire pit.

04:29.771 --> 04:31.940
I can't get a fire pit,
I have two babies.

04:32.023 --> 04:33.733
But the fire pit is a no brainer.
Oh, hi there.

04:34.442 --> 04:38.196
Hi, Robert. Hey. Um, how are you doing?
Good to see you again.

04:38.571 --> 04:40.531
Where is everyone?
Where is Andy?

04:40.615 --> 04:41.866
Andy took some of
the other people

04:42.033 --> 04:43.326
on a corporate
retreat to Gettysburg.

04:44.202 --> 04:48.581
Well, I was hoping to talk
out some ideas with Andy.

04:50.792 --> 04:55.546
But what we have
here is perhaps better.

04:56.631 --> 04:58.841
By not going on the trip,
you've shown

04:58.967 --> 05:01.219
you're the free
thinkers of the office.

05:01.344 --> 05:04.305
Robert, you've got your sheep,
and you got your black sheep.

05:04.389 --> 05:07.100
And I'm not even a sheep.
I am on the freaking moon.

05:09.394 --> 05:11.229
So, here's what we can do.

05:11.938 --> 05:12.939
Game changers.

05:13.481 --> 05:15.817
Changes to the game,
such that the game

05:15.942 --> 05:18.319
can never be played
the same way again.

05:18.987 --> 05:22.156
Everyone,
brainstorm some innovations.

05:22.573 --> 05:25.493
Don't be afraid to
get weird with it.

05:26.953 --> 05:28.079
Meredith!

05:30.415 --> 05:31.541
Excited.

05:34.794 --> 05:35.920
Okay.

05:46.931 --> 05:49.976
You guys, get excited!

05:50.101 --> 05:51.269
Movie's almost over.

05:53.521 --> 05:56.482
All right, we're here.
Limitless can wait.

05:58.776 --> 06:00.695
Fun fact. In France,
they call Limitless

06:00.820 --> 06:02.739
"The Man with
Many Capabilities."

06:02.822 --> 06:07.952
Whoo-hoo! Ladies and gentlemen,
the 1800s await you.

06:09.370 --> 06:11.164
We can watch
Limitless on the way back.

06:11.289 --> 06:13.124
I got Source Code
on the way back.

06:15.168 --> 06:16.169
Whoo!

06:18.171 --> 06:19.505
Where are you going?

06:20.673 --> 06:23.217
Visitors' Center. Going to grab
a map for the memorials, right?

06:23.301 --> 06:25.219
We're not going to the Visitors' Center.
We're not tourists.

06:25.803 --> 06:26.763
No, of course
we're not tourists.

06:26.846 --> 06:29.057
We're just people that aren't
from here who are taking a tour.

06:29.140 --> 06:31.476
Yeah, the sign says,
"Begin tour here."

06:31.809 --> 06:35.063
Unless you're going on
the very specially created

06:35.146 --> 06:37.732
and meticulously researched
Andy Bernard Tour.

06:38.816 --> 06:40.651
After Chancellorsville,

06:40.735 --> 06:44.864
Lee brought his army up the Shenandoah
Valley, right through here.

06:44.947 --> 06:49.202
They stopped in this field for a
picnic, which they called "lunch."

06:49.452 --> 06:50.953
Yeah,
but I'm confused...

06:51.079 --> 06:52.580
Total deaths
belongs to Gettysburg.

06:52.663 --> 06:54.916
But when you're talking about
DPA, that's deaths per acre...

06:55.041 --> 06:57.001
Uh-huh. ...nothing beats the
Battle of Schrute Farms.

06:57.502 --> 06:59.754
Oh, DPA sounds way more important...
Oh, it is.

06:59.921 --> 07:02.590
And you should read some of these
letters that the soldiers wrote home.

07:02.673 --> 07:04.801
I mean, it makes
the Battle of Gettysburg

07:04.884 --> 07:06.969
sound like a bunch of schoolgirls
wrestling over a hairbrush.

07:08.805 --> 07:13.267
I'm telling you, they're heartbreaking, too.
So beautifully written.

07:13.351 --> 07:15.186
Dwight, what are
you telling this girl?

07:15.353 --> 07:16.562
The truth.

07:16.646 --> 07:19.190
Stop filling her head with nonsense, okay?
She doesn't know any better.

07:19.690 --> 07:21.192
Oscar, I'm so glad
you just got here.

07:21.317 --> 07:22.777
I would have
believed everything he said.

07:22.860 --> 07:25.029
No,no,no. You're filling
her head with nonsense.

07:25.238 --> 07:27.532
You and the history books.
I'm telling the truth!

07:27.615 --> 07:28.825
Interesting.

07:28.950 --> 07:30.159
Yes, thank you.

07:30.243 --> 07:32.537
All of history has
been whitewashed.

07:32.620 --> 07:34.664
Really? Why don't you tell us
the real history, Gore Vidal?

07:35.206 --> 07:36.999
Okay, I will.
I don't know who that is,

07:37.083 --> 07:38.126
but I'm going
to tell you this.

07:38.209 --> 07:39.168
He's a historian.

07:39.252 --> 07:42.547
Gettysburg was very important.
Credit where credit is due, okay?

07:42.630 --> 07:45.049
Big mad props to Gettysburg.

07:45.133 --> 07:48.553
Was it, however, the most
northern battle of the Civil War?

07:48.928 --> 07:50.096
Yes, yes...
Not by a long shot!

07:50.179 --> 07:51.139
Yes!
No!

07:51.264 --> 07:54.308
No, it was not! No, it was not!

07:54.392 --> 07:56.060
Was it the second
most northern?

07:56.144 --> 07:57.395
What?

07:57.478 --> 08:00.148
Sure! I would cede it was the
second most northern battle...

08:00.231 --> 08:01.274
Erin!

08:01.357 --> 08:03.317
Was it the northernmost?
No! Get out of here, Oscar...

08:03.401 --> 08:04.402
Get out of here!

08:04.610 --> 08:10.241
I am so eager to hear your game changers.
Let's dig in, shall we?

08:10.408 --> 08:12.326
May I go first?
Absolutely.

08:15.204 --> 08:18.291
Raw fish.The disgusting
food from Japan

08:18.374 --> 08:20.042
that Americans
would never want to eat.

08:20.418 --> 08:22.086
Now, we can't
get enough of it.

08:22.461 --> 08:26.591
From movie stars to construction
workers, sushi is what's for dinner.

08:28.009 --> 08:33.264
Let me throw another idea at you.
Origami. What?

08:33.806 --> 08:37.560
The crazy art of paper folding
from, that's right, Japan.

08:38.102 --> 08:40.271
Don't you wish you
could go back to 1980

08:40.354 --> 08:43.149
and open the first sushi
restaurant in Manhattan?

08:43.941 --> 08:45.735
We can do that with

08:47.111 --> 08:50.448
origami,
it's the sushi of paper.

08:51.240 --> 08:52.491
This idea hasn't gripped me.

08:53.784 --> 08:54.869
What else did
you come up with?

08:55.036 --> 08:56.954
I had to memorize
the presentation, Robert,

08:57.121 --> 08:59.081
and it took a long time
to build the swan, so.

08:59.373 --> 09:00.499
That was bad.

09:02.210 --> 09:04.045
If your woman is like mine,

09:04.128 --> 09:06.797
I bet you come home to hear
the same thing all the time.

09:07.590 --> 09:10.259
"This paper is so hard.
It scratches.

09:10.384 --> 09:13.054
"Why can't there be
a paper just for me?

09:13.137 --> 09:14.305
Well, now there is.

09:18.142 --> 09:21.687
It's pink,
scented and silky soft.

09:22.063 --> 09:25.983
Now, you can watch the game, and she
can write a letter to her sister.

09:27.151 --> 09:30.905
The situation you described, returning
home to a wife complaining about

09:30.988 --> 09:33.491
her paper being too masculine, is
not one that I'm familiar with.

09:34.158 --> 09:36.827
In the African American community.
No.

09:38.371 --> 09:39.830
Thought it was worth a try.

09:40.665 --> 09:42.041
That's fascinating.

09:42.124 --> 09:45.002
Tell me, what's the significance
of the peach orchard, though?

09:45.378 --> 09:47.380
Well, that's a great question.
Actually, some of the most...

09:47.463 --> 09:49.048
Excuse me,
I've got a question for you.

09:49.840 --> 09:51.842
Can you tell us about
the Battle of Schrute Farms?

09:52.510 --> 09:53.719
Oh, I haven't
heard of that one.

09:53.886 --> 09:56.764
Really?
Okay, follow-up question,

09:56.847 --> 09:58.516
how much are they paying you
to keep your mouth shut?

09:59.267 --> 10:03.229
I apologize for my friend. And for the
Republicans who are cutting your funding.

10:03.354 --> 10:05.231
We don't need to
bother this poor gentleman.

10:05.356 --> 10:07.316
I know exactly where
we're going. Giddy-up!

10:09.151 --> 10:10.528
Tallyho!

10:12.863 --> 10:14.115
Are you Lincoln?

10:14.240 --> 10:15.491
No, no, I'm...

10:16.242 --> 10:20.204
Apparently, I bear a passing
resemblance to Abraham Lincoln.

10:20.329 --> 10:21.789
It makes it kind of
hard for me to go to places

10:21.872 --> 10:23.874
like museums,
historical monuments,

10:24.000 --> 10:26.002
elementary schools.
I don't see it.

10:26.502 --> 10:28.587
Chelsea, give Mr. Lincoln your
hat so I can take a picture.

10:28.879 --> 10:30.464
Okay, quick.

10:32.216 --> 10:34.385
Hey, Lincoln's starting.

10:35.970 --> 10:40.057
Oh, no. No, no, no, no. I'm actually
with a tour group myself, so...

10:43.352 --> 10:45.896
Hello, I'm Abraham Lincoln.

10:46.731 --> 10:49.108
Some people call me
the "Great Emancipator,"

10:49.191 --> 10:51.235
but you might know
me from the penny.

10:53.195 --> 10:55.990
Okay, you know
the test booklets

10:56.073 --> 10:57.992
that they give out
in all the schools?

10:58.075 --> 11:00.119
I was thinking that we could
put a coupon in the back

11:00.202 --> 11:03.080
that people
would mail in to us.

11:03.247 --> 11:06.125
And as, you know, as I
tell it, I don't like it.

11:07.376 --> 11:09.879
Unless, of course, you are
responding to it. I am not.

11:10.463 --> 11:12.089
Um, excuse me, I'm going
to go to the bathroom.

11:13.049 --> 11:15.092
At this point,
when you're this pregnant,

11:15.217 --> 11:17.261
it's kind of
like senior spring.

11:18.137 --> 11:20.431
The other day, I spit my
gum out on the carpet.

11:21.098 --> 11:23.059
Kevin. You've been quiet.

11:24.101 --> 11:26.270
I'm curious to know
what your game changer is.

11:27.104 --> 11:28.606
You know how
in the vending machine,

11:28.939 --> 11:32.777
they have the chocolate chip
cookies in the A-1 spot?

11:32.902 --> 11:34.362
They do that
because they think

11:34.445 --> 11:36.614
A-1 is the best spot
for the best cookie.

11:37.573 --> 11:40.618
But the real best spot is D-4.

11:40.701 --> 11:42.787
Right? That's where
the eyes go.

11:43.954 --> 11:45.122
So...

11:45.623 --> 11:49.460
Cookies. Cookie placement.

11:50.002 --> 11:52.421
Yeah. But not just
the cookies, though.

11:53.714 --> 11:55.007
That was just a for instance.

11:55.716 --> 11:57.593
Who else agrees with Kevin

11:57.676 --> 12:02.473
that we're wasting facilities,
manpower on our underselling products,

12:02.598 --> 12:05.810
when we should be pushing
our top performers?

12:14.944 --> 12:16.737
There you get consensus.

12:17.321 --> 12:18.614
Okay, we are
now on a planet where

12:18.697 --> 12:21.117
Kevin is the most
creative person around

12:21.659 --> 12:24.954
and I am just some
good looking guy.

12:26.038 --> 12:27.540
I just don't understand.

12:27.623 --> 12:30.668
It's 1865, victory is ours,

12:30.751 --> 12:35.840
I have saved the very soul of our
nation and yet, happiness eludes me.

12:39.677 --> 12:42.972
Oh, perhaps a trip to the theater
will enliven my spirits.

12:43.305 --> 12:44.348
No!

12:44.682 --> 12:49.019
So, another thing about oatmeal cookies.
Who even wants them?

12:49.645 --> 12:52.898
I mean, I've seen
Toby eat one like once,

12:52.982 --> 12:56.652
but other than that,
forget it.

12:57.194 --> 12:58.529
Interesting.

13:00.739 --> 13:04.827
So what is Dunder
Mifflin's oatmeal cookie?

13:05.202 --> 13:07.913
What is the product
that no one wants?

13:08.372 --> 13:11.375
How about that
two-hole punch letter?

13:11.459 --> 13:15.254
Only the lawyers want that punch
at the top, and they use legal.

13:17.423 --> 13:21.719
That's the oatmeal cookie.
Fantastic, Kevin, fantastic.

13:22.094 --> 13:23.345
Thank you.

13:24.221 --> 13:26.098
By the way, did we leave
all the food on the bus?

13:26.265 --> 13:30.144
Let's talk about food for a second.
Food for thought.

13:30.227 --> 13:31.812
Yeah, that's what I
had for breakfast,

13:31.937 --> 13:33.522
and I think that's
probably why I'm still hungry.

13:33.606 --> 13:38.861
Hunger. Hunger for victory. Hunger
for honor, hunger for pride.

13:38.944 --> 13:40.571
Hunger for hamburgers.

13:40.696 --> 13:42.281
Hunger for
chicken chimichangas.

13:42.364 --> 13:43.491
Right, Darryl?
That's good.

13:43.657 --> 13:48.078
Exactly. Now, do you know what the
Civil War soldiers were hungry for?

13:48.746 --> 13:51.499
Pride. Now, each
battalion had its own flag,

13:51.582 --> 13:53.334
and they guarded these
flags with their lives.

13:53.417 --> 13:57.880
Colonel Harrison Jeffords
of the 4th Michigan Infantry

13:58.005 --> 13:59.924
saw his flag
being carried away,

14:00.090 --> 14:02.051
chased it down with
nothing but a sword,

14:03.093 --> 14:07.306
fought tooth and nail at the
foot of that flag until he died.

14:07.932 --> 14:09.600
He wasn't about to
let them have that flag.

14:10.559 --> 14:12.978
Pride. Right, guys?

14:15.439 --> 14:19.360
I commissioned this flag for Dunder Mifflin.
It cost me $200.

14:19.777 --> 14:21.028
Only $200?

14:21.111 --> 14:25.824
We are all branches on this tree.
And from the tree comes paper.

14:26.116 --> 14:30.329
We're all part of a business,
but business is war.

14:31.247 --> 14:32.289
What's that I hear?

14:32.957 --> 14:37.127
Oh! A rebel paper company
is coming to take our flag.

14:37.211 --> 14:39.630
What's going on here?
Whee-hoo!

14:39.838 --> 14:43.592
Come and get it! Who's going to get the flag?
Who's getting it? Whoa, hey!

14:43.717 --> 14:46.470
Don't look where I am, look where I'm going.
Jerk right, jerk left, jerk...

14:46.554 --> 14:48.847
Andy, this is inappropriate.
People died here, man.

14:49.098 --> 14:52.017
Get the flag, get the flag!
Come on, Big Tuna.

14:52.184 --> 14:54.520
What are you going to do about it?
We've got a flag right here!

14:54.603 --> 14:55.604
Whee-hoo!

14:57.523 --> 15:00.276
Spangler's Spring
is a mile this way.

15:00.359 --> 15:05.656
Oh, wow. So, that's two miles if
you incorporate the walk back.

15:07.283 --> 15:09.952
It's... I mean, come on.

15:10.035 --> 15:12.288
Oh, I don't think I
should walk anymore.

15:12.371 --> 15:14.623
All I had for
breakfast was oatmeal,

15:14.707 --> 15:18.168
yogurt, coffee,
orange juice and toast.

15:18.752 --> 15:21.589
Two poached eggs and then that
half a sandwich on the bus.

15:21.672 --> 15:22.673
I can't.

15:22.840 --> 15:24.425
All right, fine.
You know what?

15:24.508 --> 15:25.843
I guess this place
just hasn't rubbed off

15:26.010 --> 15:27.344
on you the way
that I hoped it would.

15:29.513 --> 15:34.393
I'm still going, and I'm
not going to ask anymore.

15:35.060 --> 15:36.562
I'm not even
going to look back,

15:36.687 --> 15:38.230
I'm just going to
assume that you're with me.

15:47.281 --> 15:49.366
You said you weren't
going to look back.

15:52.202 --> 15:53.787
And why is BlackRock

15:53.871 --> 15:58.626
suddenly the paragon by which all
hedge funds must now be compared?

15:59.877 --> 16:00.919
Yeah, I don't know.

16:01.170 --> 16:03.631
Right? I mean,
you're an accountant,

16:03.714 --> 16:06.675
those bogus prospectuses
must drive you insane.

16:07.551 --> 16:11.221
Yes, I am an accountant.

16:12.056 --> 16:15.142
Dwight, this is one
of the archivists here.

16:15.225 --> 16:17.061
I thought maybe
we can consult him.

16:17.144 --> 16:18.228
Really?
Yeah.

16:18.312 --> 16:21.857
Well, anyone employed by the
Gettysburg industrial complex

16:21.940 --> 16:23.525
is certainly going
to want to keep quiet

16:23.651 --> 16:25.235
about the Battle
of Schrute Farms.

16:25.527 --> 16:27.488
Schrute Farms, did you say?

16:27.571 --> 16:30.824
That is a fascinating little
chapter of the Civil War.

16:30.908 --> 16:31.992
You've heard about it?

16:32.076 --> 16:36.455
Yes!Ha! Prepare to be refuted.
Go on, come on.

16:37.289 --> 16:38.332
There you go.

16:40.376 --> 16:41.835
Families
and sweethearts back home

16:41.919 --> 16:44.296
waited desperately for
letters from the front.

16:44.963 --> 16:49.093
"Dearest Mother, I'm sorry it has
been so long since my last letter.

16:49.176 --> 16:51.762
"It is three months since I
arrived at Schrute Farms,

16:51.929 --> 16:56.642
<i>"and I fear I may never leave this place alive.
Melvyn Fifer Garris. "</i>

16:57.184 --> 16:58.644
Hallowed ground.

16:59.228 --> 17:02.189
But the battle at Schrute
Farms was no battle at all.

17:02.272 --> 17:05.818
It was a code used by pacifists
from both North and South,

17:05.901 --> 17:07.361
who'd turned
the Pennsylvania farmhouse

17:07.444 --> 17:10.739
into an artistic community
and a refuge from the war.

17:10.823 --> 17:14.535
You have to understand,
poets, artists, dancers,

17:14.952 --> 17:17.746
these kinds of men
preferred peace to war.

17:17.830 --> 17:21.542
These delicate, lovely men
found a place of refuge

17:21.625 --> 17:23.585
among the Schrutes
of Schrute Farm.

17:23.669 --> 17:26.296
Amidst the macho
brutality of war,

17:26.380 --> 17:30.884
this was a place where dandies
and dreamers could put on plays,

17:30.968 --> 17:33.220
sing tender ballads
and dance in the moonlight.

17:33.554 --> 17:37.474
I like to think of Schrute Farm
as the Underground Railroad

17:37.558 --> 17:41.437
for the sensitive and,
well, fabulous.

17:42.479 --> 17:45.149
Wow, this is so much better
than the story you made up.

17:45.983 --> 17:47.025
I've seen enough.

17:47.151 --> 17:49.069
You're right, there should
be a monument to this.

17:49.653 --> 17:53.157
Never trust a cookie
with a woman's name.

17:53.824 --> 17:58.162
Pecan Sandy.
Lorna Doone. Madeleine.

17:58.370 --> 17:59.371
Oh...

17:59.705 --> 18:01.373
They'll just break your heart.

18:04.710 --> 18:06.503
Kevin, you are...

18:06.587 --> 18:10.090
Robert, I hate to interrupt, but I
would love to pitch you one last idea.

18:10.424 --> 18:12.718
I call it the Big Mac idea.

18:12.885 --> 18:14.303
What? No.

18:14.386 --> 18:15.846
Big Mac idea.
Sounds encouraging.

18:16.013 --> 18:18.307
It's really, really good, Robert.
Let me explain.

18:18.390 --> 18:20.726
No, this is not fair.
This is my idea.

18:20.851 --> 18:23.520
He's trying to steal it
because he's jealous of me.

18:25.063 --> 18:26.440
Well, what is the idea?

18:26.523 --> 18:31.195
Every time you buy a Big Mac,
you set one ingredient aside.

18:31.737 --> 18:36.325
Then, at the end of the week,
you have a free Big Mac.

18:36.408 --> 18:40.204
And you love it even more, because
you made it with your own hands.

18:41.079 --> 18:44.958
You know what? Now I remember.
That was your idea.

18:45.042 --> 18:47.544
That is 100% your idea.

18:50.172 --> 18:51.840
Oh, my-

18:53.675 --> 18:56.386
It was just actually
cookies the whole time.

18:59.097 --> 19:01.058
Damn it.
Hey.

19:03.393 --> 19:05.729
You guys came.
Where's everyone else?

19:06.230 --> 19:08.524
Back at the bus.
We were locked out.

19:08.607 --> 19:10.901
Phyllis is sitting on the ground,
eating a dirty sandwich.

19:11.318 --> 19:13.403
Yeah, I asked
the bus driver to lock it

19:13.487 --> 19:15.447
because our stuff was in there.
I guess he follows orders.

19:15.906 --> 19:18.992
Yeah, sorry everybody else didn't come.
I think they're just tired.

19:19.076 --> 19:21.578
With holes in their
shoes and their dysentery.

19:22.371 --> 19:24.122
Even without an audience,
you're still at it.

19:24.623 --> 19:25.624
What are you talking about?

19:25.749 --> 19:30.087
Our office has a disease,
and it goes by many names.

19:30.337 --> 19:34.383
Sarcasm, snark, "wisecracks."

19:34.716 --> 19:36.510
You take things
that people care about,

19:36.593 --> 19:39.847
and you make them feel lame
about it with your jokes.

19:39.930 --> 19:41.598
That's what you
did with this trip.

19:42.015 --> 19:45.519
Andy, this whole
idea of our situation

19:45.602 --> 19:48.021
being just like war,
it's just not true.

19:48.355 --> 19:49.940
We just work at
a paper company,

19:50.065 --> 19:51.650
and you're our
regional manager.

19:51.733 --> 19:55.070
And guess what, man? You don't
have to prove anything.

19:55.153 --> 19:58.198
We like you as
regional manager.

19:58.282 --> 20:01.243
Andy, if you don't believe me,
take a look at what's on my head.

20:01.618 --> 20:03.287
I'm wearing a very pink hat.

20:03.662 --> 20:06.456
I've been getting weird looks all
day, because I'm pretty sure

20:06.540 --> 20:08.917
"DM does GB" means
something kind of sexual.

20:09.167 --> 20:11.712
But guess who's wearing them?
All of us.

20:11.837 --> 20:14.381
Just for you, man.
That's huge.

20:16.466 --> 20:17.551
You don't like the hats?

20:17.634 --> 20:18.635
They're terrible.

20:18.802 --> 20:19.803
I hate myself.

20:20.470 --> 20:23.432
They just didn't turn out how I wanted.
In my head, they were cooler.

20:23.515 --> 20:24.516
But they do look weird.

20:25.767 --> 20:27.227
The world
will little note

20:27.311 --> 20:29.605
nor long
remember the fight that

20:29.730 --> 20:31.982
Jim and I had
here at Gettysburg.

20:32.065 --> 20:34.776
And that's good,
because I was basically wrong.

20:35.611 --> 20:39.448
I wanted my team to be like this
army and I was their general,

20:39.531 --> 20:40.908
but I guess it's
really just more like

20:40.991 --> 20:43.827
they're people who work in an
office and I'm their manager.

20:45.287 --> 20:49.333
Yeah, that's really probably a better analogy.
Now that I think about it.

20:51.919 --> 20:54.504
Abe and Mary are
seated watching the show.

20:56.465 --> 20:59.509
Oh, Mary, this is wonderful.

21:00.552 --> 21:03.972
Okay, Mary, stop your
scolding. I'll be quiet.

21:05.182 --> 21:08.185
I need her like I need
a hole in the head!

21:12.314 --> 21:14.024
Mmm. Oh...

21:15.692 --> 21:17.778
Bang!
