WEBVTT

00:04.255 --> 00:06.837
WALT: CHARACTER IS FATE.

00:08.634 --> 00:11.546
THE PHILOSOPHER HERACLITUS
SAID THAT.

00:13.306 --> 00:14.295
I THINK HE MEANT,

00:14.515 --> 00:18.884
MAN MAKES HIS DESTINY THROUGH
HIS CHOICES AND HIS VALUES.

00:20.480 --> 00:21.686
MARTHA:
BE CAREFUL, WALT!

00:23.232 --> 00:24.608
I'LL TRY, MARTHA.

00:30.948 --> 00:32.108
I'LL TRY.

00:35.369 --> 00:40.659
SO, AS THE ARRESTING OFFICER
OF JULY 27, 2010,

00:40.875 --> 00:42.365
IS IT YOUR OPINION
MALACHI STRAND

00:42.585 --> 00:44.826
SHOULD BE GRANTED
EARLY PAROLE?

00:45.755 --> 00:49.589
MY OPINION IS THAT
AS THE TRIBAL POLICE CHIEF,

00:49.800 --> 00:52.837
MALACHI STRAND WAS IN FACT
THE MOST DANGEROUS CRIMINAL

00:53.054 --> 00:55.295
ON THE ENTIRE
CHEYENNE RESERVATION.

00:56.057 --> 00:58.639
WHERE ARE THOSE FEDERAL AGENTS
THE B.I.A. PROMISED?

00:58.851 --> 01:00.136
I GOT TIRED
OF WAITING FOR 'EM.

01:00.353 --> 01:03.220
SO YOU'RE GOING TO ARREST
MALACHI IN HIS OWN STATION

01:03.439 --> 01:04.474
WITHOUT ANY BACK-U P?

01:04.690 --> 01:06.806
NOT ENTIRELY
WITHOUT BACK-U P.

01:20.623 --> 01:22.955
MR. STRAND HAS EXPRESSED REMORSE
FOR HIS RECORD.

01:23.167 --> 01:24.247
AS A MATTER OF FACT,

01:24.460 --> 01:26.041
HE HAS CONVINCED
A NUMBER OF PEOPLE HERE

01:26.254 --> 01:29.212
OF HIS REHABILITATION AND
FITNESS FOR REENTERING SOCIETY.

01:30.091 --> 01:31.376
WALT:
I DON'T DOUBT THAT.

01:34.178 --> 01:38.046
WELL, IF IT ISN'T
THE LONG FACE OF THE LAW

01:38.266 --> 01:42.179
AND HIS LITTLE SIDEKICK...
DEPUTY HANK.

01:42.812 --> 01:44.348
THIS IS
A FEDERALLY ISSUED WARRANT

01:44.564 --> 01:46.395
TO ARREST YOU
ON EXTORTION CHARGES.

01:50.736 --> 01:52.442
HENRY AND I ARE HERE
TO SERVE IT.

01:52.738 --> 01:57.107
YOU TWO SHOULD PROBABLY SET
YOUR WEAPONS DOWN NOW.

01:57.326 --> 01:59.032
YOU REALLY THINK I'D WALK
IN HERE TO ARREST YOU

01:59.245 --> 02:00.701
WITHOUT FEDERAL BACK-UP?

02:01.038 --> 02:02.369
YOU'RE BLUFFING.

02:06.752 --> 02:08.834
AM I?

02:09.046 --> 02:11.913
MAN: WE UNDERSTAND WHO
MALACHI STRAND USED TO BE.

02:12.425 --> 02:14.586
WHAT WE'RE TRYING TO DETERMINE
IS, WHO IS HE NOW?

02:14.802 --> 02:16.087
HOW'S HE CHANGED?

02:16.304 --> 02:19.512
A FEW WEEKS AGO,
MALACHI TRIED TO EXTORT ME

02:19.724 --> 02:21.339
INTO GIVING
FAVORABLE TESTIMONY

02:21.559 --> 02:23.424
BY THREATENING THE LIFE
OF MY FRIEND.

02:23.644 --> 02:25.259
IF MALACHI IS RELEASED,

02:25.479 --> 02:27.936
HIS ABUSE AND CORRUPTION
WILL ONLY CONTINUE.

02:28.149 --> 02:30.060
MALACHI'S CHARACTER
HAS NOT CHANGED.

02:30.276 --> 02:33.609
AND JAIL IS THE ONLY PROPER FATE
FOR A MAN LIKE HIM.

02:50.004 --> 02:51.835
ON THE PAROLE HEARING,
I WANT TO HEAR IT.

02:52.673 --> 02:54.083
WHOSE PAROLE HEARING?

02:54.300 --> 02:55.460
MALACHI STRAND.

02:55.676 --> 02:57.712
RUBY, HOW MANY VACATION DAYS
DO I HAVE?

02:57.928 --> 02:58.883
ALL OF THEM.

03:00.556 --> 03:02.922
VACATION DAYS?
I'M TAKING THE DAY OFF.

03:03.142 --> 03:05.508
AS FAR AS I CAN TELL,
THE BEST WAY TO CLEAR HENRY

03:05.728 --> 03:08.390
IS TO FIND THE PERSON THAT
ACTUALLY KILLED MILLER BECK.

03:08.606 --> 03:11.393
SINCE WHEN IS FINDING A MURDERER
NOT POLICE BUSINESS?

03:11.609 --> 03:13.600
IT'S NOT OUR POLICE BUSINESS.
IT'S DENVER'S.

03:13.819 --> 03:16.151
I DON'T THINK OUR TAXPAYERS
SHOULD BE PAYING FOR ME

03:16.364 --> 03:17.524
TO PURSUE A PERSONAL MATTER.

03:17.740 --> 03:18.980
SO YOU THINK
ONE OF THESE GUYS

03:19.200 --> 03:20.406
IS BEHIND
YOUR WIFE'S MURDER?

03:20.618 --> 03:23.485
I THINK THEY HAD MOTIVATION,
INTELLIGENCE,

03:23.704 --> 03:26.161
MAYBE EVEN OPPORTUNITY.

03:26.374 --> 03:28.615
MALACHI WAS IN PRISON
WHEN THE MURDERS HAPPENED,

03:28.834 --> 03:33.999
BUT, UH...NOT THIS GUY
OR THIS GUY...

03:36.092 --> 03:38.048
...OR THIS GUY.

03:39.220 --> 03:41.256
NOW I NEED TO FIGURE OUT
WHERE THESE THREE WERE,

03:41.472 --> 03:42.427
SO YOU'RE IN CHARGE.

03:42.640 --> 03:43.755
I'M SORRY.
IN CHARGE OF WHO?

03:43.974 --> 03:45.259
YOU TOLD BRANCH
TO TAKE TIME OFF

03:45.476 --> 03:47.057
AND FERG'S AT
THAT CERTIFICATION COURSE.

03:47.269 --> 03:48.770
WELL, I GOT MY RADIO
IF YOU NEED ME.

03:48.979 --> 03:50.935
THINGS HAVE BEEN PRETTY QUIET
AROUND HERE, SO...

03:51.148 --> 03:53.810
WALT, NEWT CUNNINGHAM CALLED.

03:54.985 --> 03:59.194
APPARENTLY, SOMEONE STOLE ONE
OF HIS RHODE ISLAND RED HENS.

04:03.786 --> 04:06.243
WELL, I STAND CORRECTED.

04:19.510 --> 04:22.923
I TOLD YOU I DON'T KNOW
ANYONE NAMED DAVID RIDGES.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.808
MY FRIEND TOM AND I KNOW
THAT YOU'RE A WHITE WARRIOR.

04:30.980 --> 04:32.595
JUST LIKE RIDGES.

04:33.733 --> 04:37.567
MY NAME IS SAM POTEET.
I WORK IN A HARDWARE STORE.

04:37.778 --> 04:39.894
I NEVER EVEN HEARD
OF A WHITE WARRIOR.

04:42.116 --> 04:44.277
THEN WHY DID MY FRIEND TOM HERE
SEE YOU ALL PAINTED UP

04:44.535 --> 04:48.369
WITH YOUR BUDDIES,
DANCING AROUND RIDGES' ASHES?

04:48.581 --> 04:50.788
ASHES?

04:51.000 --> 04:52.661
WHY ARE YOU EVEN LOOKING
FOR THIS RIDGES GUY

04:52.877 --> 04:54.083
IF HE'S NOT ALIVE?

04:54.295 --> 04:56.081
LET'S CALL ONE
OF YOUR WHITE WARRIOR FRIENDS

04:56.297 --> 04:57.503
SO HE CAN EXPLAIN IT
TO YOU.

04:57.715 --> 04:59.296
I KNOW OF
THE BOW STRING WARRIORS

04:59.508 --> 05:00.588
AND THE KIT FOX WARRIORS.

05:01.761 --> 05:03.672
AND THE GOLDEN STATE
WARRIORS.

05:03.888 --> 05:05.719
I DON'T KNOW
ANY WHITE WARRIORS.

05:05.931 --> 05:07.011
WHERE'S RIDGES?!

05:07.224 --> 05:08.839
I DON'T KNOW!
LIKE HELL YOU DON'T.

05:09.059 --> 05:12.017
HEY, IF HE KNEW ANYTHING,
HE WOULD HAVE TOLD YOU BY NOW.

05:12.229 --> 05:13.435
HAND ME MY THERMOS!

05:14.482 --> 05:15.597

WHAT ARE YOU DOING HERE?

05:31.499 --> 05:33.455
TAKING THAT VACATION
YOU SUGGESTED.

05:33.667 --> 05:36.044
SO, DID YOU GET THROUGH
ALL THE DISCOVERY YET?

05:36.253 --> 05:38.164
LET US DISCUSS THIS
IN MY OFFICE...

05:38.380 --> 05:40.712
SO WE CAN SPEAK IN PRIVATE.

05:46.055 --> 05:47.716
CADY:
BASICALLY, THEIR ENTIRE CASE

05:47.932 --> 05:50.298
HINGES ON MILLER BECK'S TEETH
BEING IN HENRY'S POSSESSION.

05:50.518 --> 05:51.758
BUT IF WE FIND HECTOR,

05:51.977 --> 05:53.808
HE CAN TESTIFY HOW HENRY
ACTUALLY GOT THE TEETH.

05:53.979 --> 05:55.435
SO I THINK WE NEED TO GET
HECTOR'S FACE OUT THERE,

05:55.648 --> 05:57.434
PUT UP SOME "WANTED" FLIERS.

05:57.650 --> 05:59.106
IF WE WANT PEOPLE
TO TALK ABOUT HECTOR,

05:59.318 --> 06:00.182
WE NEED TO OFFER A REWARD.

06:00.402 --> 06:02.108
WITH WHOSE MONEY?

06:03.614 --> 06:04.603
EVERYONE'S.

06:04.824 --> 06:07.190
WE STILL HAVE ALL THE MONEY
DONATED FOR HENRY'S BAIL FUND.

06:07.409 --> 06:08.535
AND MY BAIL HAS BEEN PAID FOR,

06:08.744 --> 06:10.154
SO THAT MONEY
SHOULD BE RETURNED.

06:10.371 --> 06:11.781
HENRY, THESE PEOPLE
WANT TO HELP YOU.

06:11.997 --> 06:14.113
THAT DOESN'T JUST STOP
BECAUSE YOU'RE OUT ON BAIL.

06:16.210 --> 06:17.950
I STILL HAVE SOME MONEY
SET ASIDE FROM THE CABIN.

06:25.219 --> 06:28.256
I DID NOT ASK TO BE
THE OBJECT OF CHARITY.

06:28.472 --> 06:33.091
I DIDN'T ASK YOU TO KEEP
SELF-INCRIMINATING EVIDENCE.

06:34.103 --> 06:35.718
BUT HERE WE ARE.

06:47.074 --> 06:53.035
SO...WHAT DO YOU PROPOSE?

06:53.289 --> 06:56.076
WE PULL TOGETHER A REWARD
FOR LOCATING HECTOR.

06:56.333 --> 06:58.164
NOW, IT DOESN'T HURT
TO GET PEOPLE TALKING.

06:58.377 --> 07:01.369
WHILE YOU TWO LOOK FOR HECTOR,
I'M GONNA TRACK DOWN SOME MEN

07:01.589 --> 07:03.796
THAT MAY HAVE ACTUALLY KILLED
MILLER BECK.

07:04.008 --> 07:05.339
IF WE GO WITH MY THEORY

07:05.551 --> 07:08.668
THAT MARTHA'S DEATH
WASN'T A RANDOM MUGGING...

07:13.350 --> 07:14.100
...THAT WOULD MEAN

07:14.310 --> 07:15.846
SOMEONE ACTUALLY PAID
MILLER BECK TO KILL HER.

07:16.061 --> 07:19.599
AND THEN KILLED MILLER BECK

YOU'RE GOING ALONE?

37:00.928 --> 37:02.919
SHE LIVES HERE.

37:05.849 --> 37:07.134
WHY MARK HER HOUSE?

37:07.393 --> 37:09.759
WHO COMES IN AND ASKS YOU TO
STOP LOOKING FOR A WANTED MAN?

37:10.062 --> 37:11.848
SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WHERE HE IS.

37:12.147 --> 37:13.432
AND BOTH THESE LOCATIONS

37:13.649 --> 37:15.059
ARE CLOSE TO THE CAVES
AT SUMMER PASS,

37:15.275 --> 37:17.061
WHERE THAT HIKER CLAIMED
HE SAW AN INDIAN.

37:17.277 --> 37:19.609
WELL, YEAH, BUT
THE HIKER'S DESCRIPTION

37:19.822 --> 37:21.904
DIDN'T SOUND ANYTHING
LIKE HECTOR.

37:22.116 --> 37:25.108
LONG HAIR, THIN BUILD,
MEDIUM HEIGHT.

37:25.327 --> 37:26.908
YOU KNOW WHO THIS IS,
RIGHT?

37:31.625 --> 37:33.331
IT'S DAVID RIDGES.

37:33.877 --> 37:35.538
YOU ADMITTED IT YOURSELF,
WALT.

37:35.754 --> 37:37.619
THERE'S A CHANCE
HE COULD STILL BE ALIVE.

37:38.674 --> 37:40.414
I DON'T THINK IT'S HECTOR
HIDING UP THERE.

37:41.385 --> 37:42.591
I THINK IT'S RIDGES.

37:43.887 --> 37:45.627
THERE'S ONLY ONE WAY
TO FIND OUT.

37:49.727 --> 37:53.219
MALACHI: SUCH A FINE FEELING
BEING FREE.

37:53.439 --> 37:54.849
AIN'T THAT RIGHT, HANK?

37:55.899 --> 37:57.275
SORT OF A BLESSING.

37:57.484 --> 38:00.271
YOU JUST COME AND GO
AS YOU PLEASE.

38:00.487 --> 38:01.317
[CHUCKLES]

38:02.448 --> 38:04.655
WELL, SOME OF US, ANYWAY.

38:07.828 --> 38:09.989
WHAT DO YOU IMAGINE
YOU ARE DOING?

38:11.290 --> 38:14.327
AHH.
TO SWEET FREEDOM.

38:17.421 --> 38:18.001
AHH.

38:18.213 --> 38:19.669
[SNIFFS]

38:21.592 --> 38:23.253
HEY.
THANKS FOR HOLDING MY SEAT.

38:26.221 --> 38:28.758
[SIGHS]

38:31.310 --> 38:33.926
THE BROTHERHOOD, HANK.

38:34.146 --> 38:35.852
IT WEARS MANY FACES.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.186
YOU HAVE NOT EVEN SERVED
HALF OF YOUR SENTENCE.

38:40.402 --> 38:41.903
HOW CAN YOU BE
OUT ON PAROLE?

38:42.112 --> 38:44.068
I GUESS THE WORD
OF WALTER LONGMIRE

38:44.281 --> 38:46.613
DOESN'T HOLD THE SAME SWAY
THAT IT USED TO.

38:47.367 --> 38:49.107
FUNNY HOW THINGS
WORK OUT.

38:49.328 --> 38:52.536
I'M FREE,
YOU'RE GOING BACK INSIDE.

38:53.290 --> 38:55.155
TIMES BE A-CHANGING.

38:58.754 --> 39:00.335
WHY, HANK.

39:02.508 --> 39:04.544
WHY IN THE WORLD

39:04.760 --> 39:07.502
WOULD YOU PUT THIS NOBLE
SPECIMEN UP FOR SALE?

39:08.889 --> 39:11.471
IT'S NOT BECAUSE
OF MONEY TROUBLES, I HOPE.

39:11.683 --> 39:14.299
[CHUCKLES]
NOW THAT I THINK OF IT,

39:14.561 --> 39:16.017
YOU'RE GONNA HAVE TO
SELL THIS PLACE

39:16.230 --> 39:17.936
BEFORE YOU GO BACK INSIDE.

39:18.148 --> 39:20.855
YOU KNOW,
MAYBE IT'D BE BETTER

39:21.068 --> 39:24.310
IF YOU KEEP IT WITH
YOUR PEOPLE, YOUR BROTHERS.

39:24.530 --> 39:26.145
WE ARE NOT BROTHERS.

39:26.365 --> 39:28.071
OH, LIGHTEN UP, HANK.

39:28.283 --> 39:30.444
WE'LL TALK ABOUT IT
WHEN THE TIME COMES.

39:31.453 --> 39:34.866
IN THE MEANTIME,
I'LL GO AHEAD

39:35.082 --> 39:37.414
AND TAKE THESE STUFFED CRITTERS
OFF YOUR HANDS.

39:38.752 --> 39:41.835
THIS OUGHT TO ADD SOME COLOR
TO MY STUDY.

39:44.174 --> 39:46.836
I'LL HAVE THE BOYS COME BY
AND PICK UP THE REST LATER.

40:13.996 --> 40:15.361
I'M NOT
GETTING SHOT AGAIN.

40:15.581 --> 40:16.912
I NEED HECTOR ALIVE.

40:17.082 --> 40:18.322
WHAT IF IT'S NOT HECTOR?

40:18.542 --> 40:20.248
THEN I NEED
DAVID RIDGES ALIVE.

40:22.254 --> 40:23.664
WALT, BLOOD.

40:40.814 --> 40:42.224
HECTOR!

40:42.441 --> 40:44.432
HECTOR:
YOU'RE TOO LATE, LAW MAN.

40:44.651 --> 40:46.107
WHAT THE HELL HAPPENED
TO HIS HEAD?

40:46.403 --> 40:47.734
HE'S BEEN SCALPED.

40:49.031 --> 40:52.865
I WAS OUTSIDE THE CAVE
WHEN HE SHOT ME.

40:53.660 --> 40:56.527
ONE IN THE CHEST,
TWO IN THE LEGS.

40:57.539 --> 41:00.372
I DRAGGED MYSELF BACK
IN HERE.

41:01.209 --> 41:03.791
BUT THE SNAKE
FOLLOWED ME IN.

41:05.714 --> 41:06.794
WHO'S THE SNAKE?

41:10.510 --> 41:12.216
WAS IT HIM?

41:12.429 --> 41:14.340
YES.

41:14.556 --> 41:17.263
THAT IS THE SNAKE WHO KILLED ME.

41:17.476 --> 41:19.762
WHY WOULD DAVID RIDGES
COME AFTER YOU?

41:19.978 --> 41:21.559
I DON'T KNOW.

41:23.357 --> 41:24.813
DOESN'T MATTER.

41:25.025 --> 41:28.233
IF IT WASN'T HIM,
IT'D BE SOMEONE ELSE.

41:28.445 --> 41:31.232
IT WAS ALWAYS GOING TO END
LIKE THIS.

41:33.241 --> 41:38.486
I ALWAYS WANTED TO DIE
AS A WARRIOR, LAW MAN,

41:39.581 --> 41:43.540
UNDER THE BIG SKY,
ON MY PEOPLE'S LAND.

41:45.420 --> 41:50.039
NOT IN SOME CAVE
LIKE AN ANIMAL.

42:21.456 --> 42:25.165
THIS IS BETWEEN ME
AND MY ANCESTORS NOW.
