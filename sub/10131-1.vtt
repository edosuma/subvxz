16:24.275 --> 16:26.527
Am I the next one

16:24.275 --> 16:26.527
to have a baby?

16:30.364 --> 16:32.492
Alright, excuse me, fellas.

16:30.364 --> 16:32.492
Let the pro in.

16:32.533 --> 16:34.577
I'll show you how it's done.

16:34.619 --> 16:37.121
Alright, little munchkin,

16:34.619 --> 16:37.121
where does it hurt?

16:42.877 --> 16:45.045
Wait a minute,

16:42.877 --> 16:45.045
give my finger back, kid.

16:46.130 --> 16:49.175
[crying]

16:54.555 --> 16:55.932
Well, your brain's

16:54.555 --> 16:55.932
not working tonight

16:55.974 --> 16:58.100
but your finger's doin' great.

16:58.142 --> 16:59.602
Joey, do me a favor.

16:59.644 --> 17:01.646
I put one of Michelle's

16:59.644 --> 17:01.646
teething rings in the freezer.

17:01.688 --> 17:04.482
I'd like a word alone

17:01.688 --> 17:04.482
with the alleged babysitter.

17:06.066 --> 17:07.652
Jesse, I guess

17:06.066 --> 17:07.652
it's a bad time to ask

17:07.694 --> 17:09.153
for that girl

17:07.694 --> 17:09.153
singer's phone number.

17:09.195 --> 17:10.446
Get out!

17:13.992 --> 17:17.119
Well, well, well.

17:17.161 --> 17:20.080
What? What? What?

17:20.122 --> 17:22.959
Shame, shame, shame.

17:23.001 --> 17:26.713
I feel like I'm being

17:23.001 --> 17:26.713
chewed out in the Grand Canyon.

17:26.754 --> 17:29.924
I suppose I should be happy

17:26.754 --> 17:29.924
the house is still standing.

17:29.966 --> 17:31.467
I must have been

17:29.966 --> 17:31.467
crazy to think

17:31.509 --> 17:34.178
that you were adult enough

17:31.509 --> 17:34.178
to take care of my kids.

17:34.220 --> 17:35.847
You really let me down.

17:37.181 --> 17:39.141
Wait a minute!

17:37.181 --> 17:39.141
Where you going?

17:39.183 --> 17:41.435
Oh, I thought

17:39.183 --> 17:41.435
I'd call up the Beastie Boys

17:41.477 --> 17:43.897
and ask them if they wanna take

17:41.477 --> 17:43.897
the girls to the park tomorrow.

17:50.486 --> 17:52.154
You love this, don't you?

17:56.576 --> 18:00.371
Uncle Jesse's the best

17:56.576 --> 18:00.371
babysitter we ever had.

18:00.413 --> 18:03.290
Yeah, but I think

18:00.413 --> 18:03.290
he's in big trouble.

18:03.332 --> 18:05.793

18:03.332 --> 18:05.793

Dad, is that you?

18:23.436 --> 18:26.105
Is it morning?

18:26.146 --> 18:29.149
D.J., Stephanie, please

18:26.146 --> 18:29.149
come over here right now.

18:30.359 --> 18:33.780
Girls, we have a problem

18:30.359 --> 18:33.780
with Uncle Jesse.

18:33.821 --> 18:35.782
Oh, no, dad,

18:33.821 --> 18:35.782
we didn't have any problems

18:35.823 --> 18:37.575
with Uncle Jesse at all.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.037
I'm sorry.

18:37.617 --> 18:41.037
He was just so irresponsible.

18:42.329 --> 18:44.040
What is this?

18:45.708 --> 18:50.546
Uh-oh. Empty bowls

18:45.708 --> 18:50.546
and empty cartons.

18:51.547 --> 18:54.216
Oh, now I see

18:51.547 --> 18:54.216
what happened.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.343
Uncle Jesse forced

18:54.258 --> 18:56.343
ice cream sundaes

18:56.385 --> 18:58.596
and chocolate milk

18:56.385 --> 18:58.596
down your throats

18:58.638 --> 19:01.599
and then he hid the evidence

18:58.638 --> 19:01.599
under your table.

19:01.641 --> 19:03.768
Ah, the sick fiend.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.352
He probably ignored you

19:03.810 --> 19:05.352
when you told him

19:05.394 --> 19:07.605
no sweets

19:05.394 --> 19:07.605
after bedtime, huh?

19:07.647 --> 19:09.189
Probably.

19:10.108 --> 19:11.275
No probably about it

19:11.317 --> 19:12.860
because otherwise

19:11.317 --> 19:12.860
you'd be lying.

19:12.902 --> 19:14.904
And you know better

19:12.902 --> 19:14.904
than that, don't you?

19:14.946 --> 19:16.530
Probably.

19:18.074 --> 19:20.827
Well, that does it.

19:20.868 --> 19:22.912
I guess asking Uncle Jesse

19:22.954 --> 19:25.289
to move in here

19:22.954 --> 19:25.289
was just a big mistake.

19:25.331 --> 19:28.167
In fact, this may

19:25.331 --> 19:28.167
be a matter for the police.

19:29.794 --> 19:32.212
Now, sweet dreams,

19:29.794 --> 19:32.212
my perfect little angels.

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
- Daddy!

19:32.254 --> 19:34.381
- Dad!

19:34.423 --> 19:36.050
We were bad.

19:36.092 --> 19:37.384
We did everything.

19:37.426 --> 19:39.887
We even ordered the pizza.

19:39.929 --> 19:42.974
We should all go

19:39.929 --> 19:42.974
apologize to Uncle Jesse.

19:43.016 --> 19:44.391
You're right.

19:44.433 --> 19:45.935
You go first.

19:47.770 --> 19:49.647
Are you gonna punish us?

19:49.689 --> 19:51.816
Before you answer that.

19:54.027 --> 19:56.445
We saved you

19:54.027 --> 19:56.445
a slice of pizza.

20:01.617 --> 20:03.536
Good point, Michelle.

20:03.577 --> 20:05.204
The thing I wonder is..

20:05.245 --> 20:07.040
What's life all about anyway?

20:08.916 --> 20:11.878
I mean, 24 hours ago,

20:08.916 --> 20:11.878
I was a relatively cool guy.

20:11.919 --> 20:14.755
Today I'm a six foot

20:11.919 --> 20:14.755
teething ring.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.133
Yeah, alright, bed time.

20:14.797 --> 20:17.133
We're goin' to my bed.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
Come with me.

20:17.175 --> 20:19.510
Come on. Let's go.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.845
Okay, hang on.

20:19.552 --> 20:20.845
I'll put it back.

20:20.887 --> 20:22.346
There you go.

20:25.099 --> 20:26.308
Uncle Jesse.

20:26.350 --> 20:28.186
Whatever it is,

20:26.350 --> 20:28.186
the answer is no.

20:31.564 --> 20:33.024
We just wanted

20:31.564 --> 20:33.024
to say thanks

20:33.066 --> 20:35.484
for trying to keep

20:33.066 --> 20:35.484
us out of trouble.

20:35.526 --> 20:37.361
The only reason

20:35.526 --> 20:37.361
we took advantage of you

20:37.403 --> 20:39.989
is because you had

20:37.403 --> 20:39.989
no idea what you were doing.

20:42.282 --> 20:44.368
From now on,

20:42.282 --> 20:44.368
we'll be good

20:44.410 --> 20:46.412
and do whatever you say.

20:46.453 --> 20:48.581
Steph, don't get crazy.

20:50.083 --> 20:51.709
We'll try to do better.

20:53.377 --> 20:57.297
You can cover up

20:53.377 --> 20:57.297
my bunnies if you want.

20:57.339 --> 21:00.218
That's alright. Your bunnies

20:57.339 --> 21:00.218
are starting to grow on me.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.053
We really love you.

21:02.095 --> 21:03.637
Well, I love you girls, too.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.932
But next time you pull

21:03.679 --> 21:05.932
that stuff on me..

21:08.684 --> 21:10.269
...I'm still

21:08.684 --> 21:10.269
gonna love you.

21:13.313 --> 21:15.858
Aww!

21:15.900 --> 21:17.902
Okay, now either

21:15.900 --> 21:17.902
you girls go to bed for real

21:17.944 --> 21:19.612
or I'm taking

21:17.944 --> 21:19.612
everything out of your room

21:19.653 --> 21:22.573
and turning it

21:19.653 --> 21:22.573
into a 24-hour minimart.

21:22.615 --> 21:23.783
Goodnight, everybody.

21:23.824 --> 21:25.284
Goodnight, daddy,

21:23.824 --> 21:25.284
goodnight, Michelle.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.912
- Goodnight, Uncle Jesse.

21:25.325 --> 21:27.912
- Goodnight, honey.

21:31.999 --> 21:33.876
- Hi.

21:35.044 --> 21:37.880
Want a slice of pizza?

21:37.922 --> 21:41.634
No. Me and the little leech

21:37.922 --> 21:41.634
are gonna try to get some sleep.

21:41.675 --> 21:43.261
I couldn't find

21:41.675 --> 21:43.261
Michelle's teething ring

21:43.302 --> 21:44.804
so I got the next best thing..

21:44.845 --> 21:46.847
An ice cold carrot.

21:49.892 --> 21:51.769
What? I could've brought

21:49.892 --> 21:51.769
the fish sticks but you guys

21:51.811 --> 21:53.604
would've thought

21:51.811 --> 21:53.604
I was an idiot.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.193
Look, Jesse..

21:59.235 --> 22:01.070
I want you to know

21:59.235 --> 22:01.070
that was really nice of you

22:01.112 --> 22:04.740
to take the rap

22:01.112 --> 22:04.740
for D.J. and Stephanie.

22:04.782 --> 22:07.743
And I'm real sorry

22:04.782 --> 22:07.743
I got so crazy before

22:07.785 --> 22:10.704
walking around you

22:07.785 --> 22:10.704
going, "well, well, well."

22:12.248 --> 22:14.125
It's cool, cool, cool.

22:15.209 --> 22:17.795
The girls just

22:15.209 --> 22:17.795
mean so much to me

22:17.837 --> 22:20.840
especially now,

22:17.837 --> 22:20.840
you know, since Pam's gone.

22:20.881 --> 22:22.341
I know what you're sayin', man.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.551
I worry about them, too.

22:22.382 --> 22:24.551
They're my nieces.

22:26.095 --> 22:28.097
But I don't know nothin'

22:26.095 --> 22:28.097
about this kid stuff.

22:29.473 --> 22:32.018
Yeah, I know, but both you guys,

22:29.473 --> 22:32.018
you gotta remember

22:32.059 --> 22:33.727
don't be afraid to say no.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.147
- Kids need limits.

22:33.769 --> 22:36.147
- What am I supposed to know?

22:36.189 --> 22:38.607
I been here 12 hours, you expect

22:36.189 --> 22:38.607
me to be Robert Young.

22:40.026 --> 22:41.527
Now, wait, I'm confused.

22:41.568 --> 22:44.322
Is it Robert Young

22:41.568 --> 22:44.322
from "Father Knows Best"

22:44.362 --> 22:46.657
or Robert Young,

22:44.362 --> 22:46.657

22:50.244 --> 22:53.164

22:50.244 --> 22:53.164

22:53.206 --> 22:56.000
But we can make this work

22:53.206 --> 22:56.000
if we want it to work.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.086
Jesse, you do want this

22:56.042 --> 22:59.086
to work, don't you?

22:59.128 --> 23:01.672
Well, at first,

22:59.128 --> 23:01.672
I wasn't sure but..

23:01.714 --> 23:04.591
Oh, when I saw

23:01.714 --> 23:04.591
that kid telling me

23:04.633 --> 23:06.969
I could cover

23:04.633 --> 23:06.969
her bunnies up and..

23:07.011 --> 23:08.637
...I was looking at that

23:07.011 --> 23:08.637
little baby in my arms

23:08.679 --> 23:11.598
counting on me to stop

23:08.679 --> 23:11.598

23:11.640 --> 23:14.185

You know, I'm just
