10:56.083 --> 10:58.917
Unfortunately

11:00.375 --> 11:01.709
There was
an experimental drug.

11:01.792 --> 11:05.500
It probably could have given
him another half a year.

11:05.583 --> 11:09.959
But Donnie's doctor, bought
and paid for by Bobby Axelrod,

11:10.041 --> 11:11.792
withheld that information...

11:11.875 --> 11:15.583
so Donnie wouldn't live
long enough to testify.

11:15.667 --> 11:19.208
His last Christmas
with you and your kids,

11:19.291 --> 11:21.333
was taken away.

11:22.792 --> 11:24.458
What the fuck
are you saying?

11:24.542 --> 11:27.417
Donnie died when he did,

11:27.500 --> 11:29.959
because that's when it was
convenient for Axelrod.

a waiver,

11:52.875 --> 11:55.625

He held my hand.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.667
Boyd is not in prison.

21:29.166 --> 21:31.959
And he's not
Papillon. So...

21:32.041 --> 21:35.375
The judge's order
releasing him is under seal.

21:35.458 --> 21:37.166
And it should stay that way
for the foreseeable future,

21:37.250 --> 21:41.250
so--maybe let that
be enough.

21:42.458 --> 21:45.583
It's Connerty asking.

21:56.500 --> 21:58.417
I  secured
Lawrence Boyd's release.

21:58.500 --> 22:03.709
He was instrumental
in bringing Axelrod to justice.

22:03.792 --> 22:05.083
Hmm.

22:05.166 --> 22:06.083
But since neither of you
could officially

22:06.166 --> 22:08.750
be affiliated
with that case,

22:08.834 --> 22:14.625
you must have come up
with something else...

22:14.709 --> 22:16.542
active cooperation?

22:17.959 --> 22:19.000
Against?

22:19.083 --> 22:20.375
What would raise
fewer eyebrows

22:20.458 --> 22:22.625
than Boyd turning
on his own employees?

22:22.709 --> 22:26.333
But I haven't seen any new cases
against Spartan-Ives.

22:26.417 --> 22:29.875
I was hoping not
to go back to Boyd.

22:29.959 --> 22:31.667
But now we have to.

22:31.750 --> 22:33.500
I'll need your help.

22:33.583 --> 22:35.750
Why would I--
You already decided.

22:35.834 --> 22:37.625
Before you told me
the Connerty piece.

22:41.291 --> 22:44.208
We here at Rhoades Airlines know
you have many travel options

22:44.291 --> 22:47.625
and are grateful that you have
chosen to fly with us.

22:47.709 --> 22:49.542
You will be rewarded.

22:49.625 --> 22:53.000
Your Honor, we request
that you unseal your order

22:53.083 --> 22:55.458
re-sentencing Lawrence Boyd
to time served.

22:55.542 --> 22:57.875
We're not saying a fraud
has necessarily  been

22:57.959 --> 23:00.500
-committed on this court, but--
-Excuse me, counselor.

23:00.583 --> 23:02.166
Please wait
for SDNY to respond.

23:02.250 --> 23:05.041
This isn't
an adversarial motion.

23:05.125 --> 23:06.250
Then don't fight.

23:06.333 --> 23:08.000
Apologies for
my tardiness.

23:08.083 --> 23:09.375
Kate Sacker, for SDNY.

23:09.458 --> 23:12.417
We originally asked you
to seal this order

23:12.500 --> 23:15.208
as a matter of witness safety
and investigative integrity.

23:15.291 --> 23:17.542
Those same concerns
still apply.

23:17.625 --> 23:18.667
We'll keep it
under seal.

23:18.750 --> 23:23.375
And maybe the government
could talk amongst itself.

23:30.625 --> 23:31.542
You say it's a dead-end,
then show up

23:31.625 --> 23:34.333
-I'm Chief of Crim.

23:34.417 --> 23:36.417
And if you remember
that whole contest,

23:36.500 --> 23:38.625
you know that Chuck likes to
pit people against one another.

23:38.709 --> 23:40.583
He thinks I'm working him,
so he's using our friendship

23:40.667 --> 23:43.917
-Wouldn't put it past him.

23:44.000 --> 23:45.333
You gonna appeal?

23:46.333 --> 23:49.000
See you
in the Second Circuit.

23:51.458 --> 23:53.458
This is the most
private room I have.

23:53.542 --> 23:55.583
No one will know
you were at the office.

23:56.834 --> 23:58.625
I've been
in war rooms before--

23:59.750 --> 24:02.125
love that frisson
of danger in the air.

24:02.208 --> 24:04.625
I've asked you here
because I require cooperation.

24:06.583 --> 24:08.000
I did what you asked.

24:08.083 --> 24:10.000
Oh, that was entre nous.

24:10.083 --> 24:13.000
Officially, I need you

24:13.083 --> 24:15.917
to give up a few
misbehaving moneylenders.

24:16.000 --> 24:17.667
I never did repent
for doing good,

24:17.750 --> 24:18.583
nor shall not now...

24:18.667 --> 24:20.875
I tell the judge
you're not cooperating,

24:20.959 --> 24:21.875
you go back inside.

24:21.959 --> 24:23.667
And I tell him
about our real deal,

24:23.750 --> 24:25.417
you bunk with me.

24:25.500 --> 24:26.667
Why, Chuck?

24:26.750 --> 24:29.333
Why do you default to
demanding and threatening?

24:29.417 --> 24:31.667
Why don't you ever ask
what I want?

24:31.750 --> 24:33.500
What do you want?

24:33.583 --> 24:34.959
Thanks for asking.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.083
I like simple pleasures--
butter in my ass,

24:38.166 --> 24:40.375
lollipops in my mouth--

24:40.458 --> 24:43.959
and taking my boat
to Antibes free and clear.

24:45.125 --> 24:46.917
I'll have
your passport returned,

24:47.000 --> 24:48.917
your supervised release
restrictions removed.

24:49.000 --> 24:50.917
Now: names.

24:51.000 --> 24:52.625
My boat.

24:52.709 --> 24:55.208
-I need The Champlain back.
-That's out of my hands.

24:55.291 --> 24:57.291
The government seized it.

24:57.375 --> 24:59.166
It's been deemed
legally forfeit.

24:59.250 --> 25:01.250
So navigate the swamp.

25:01.333 --> 25:02.542
Until then, no names.

25:02.625 --> 25:06.792
Sorry, pal, your credit,
is no good here.

25:07.917 --> 25:09.542
If he has...
what you think he has...

25:09.625 --> 25:11.750
you have a shot at
a chain of custody argument.

25:11.834 --> 25:13.625
Could convince the court that
your fingerprints could have

25:13.709 --> 25:16.667
been taken off a glass of Pappy
and transferred.

25:16.750 --> 25:18.625
How likely is that?

25:18.709 --> 25:21.417
In reality or in the collective
imagination of a jury?

25:21.500 --> 25:22.291
Either.

25:22.375 --> 25:24.250
Lightning striking

25:28.333 --> 25:29.709
He called to meet?

25:31.625 --> 25:32.875

25:32.959 --> 25:34.417
Is that
the lightning bolt?

And we look like we're having
a lovers' tiff, at best.

26:29.875 --> 26:31.375
Now, I got an important
fucking meeting to go to.

26:31.458 --> 26:33.417
So pull up your pants

26:33.500 --> 26:35.667
and stop looking to me
for help.

26:35.750 --> 26:37.417
Help yourself.

26:41.291 --> 26:43.667
I'm starting at the justifiable
tradeoff point--

26:43.750 --> 26:46.792
traceable user identity
based on the human voice.

26:46.875 --> 26:49.750
The whole thing utilizes
extant voice technology.

26:49.834 --> 26:51.625
All right.
Thoughts?

26:52.917 --> 26:53.834
Strong concept.
My only concern is:

26:53.917 --> 26:56.542
You don't own the tech
you want to retool.

26:56.625 --> 26:58.166
That's your
thermal exhaust port.

26:58.250 --> 26:58.792
My--

26:58.875 --> 27:00.834
Flaw in the Death Star.

27:00.917 --> 27:02.333
The two-meter wide gap

27:02.417 --> 27:05.083
that runs directly
into the reactor system.

27:05.166 --> 27:06.667
Why I'm here.

27:06.750 --> 27:09.208
I need help to seal it
before I get blown the fuck up.

27:09.291 --> 27:10.458
Let us talk.

27:10.542 --> 27:12.959
I think we can figure out
something you'll like.

27:13.041 --> 27:14.000
That was nice.

27:14.083 --> 27:15.792
-Yes, it went--
-Yeah, that was good.

27:20.000 --> 27:22.041
People are too harsh
on the port.

27:22.125 --> 27:23.417
They think
it's a plot problem.

27:23.500 --> 27:25.291
Like, "Why didn't
they plug the hole?"

27:25.375 --> 27:26.458
I know!
Unfairly derided.

27:26.542 --> 27:27.500
What material could  withstand
the heat expended

27:27.583 --> 27:29.542
from that mammoth sphere?

27:29.625 --> 27:31.625
Plus, it was fortified
with gun turrets and--

27:31.709 --> 27:33.375
--And a fleet
of TIE fighters. Yes.

27:33.458 --> 27:36.625
Nobody gets on Homer for the

Have dinner with me.

27:41.208 --> 27:43.250
I can get a table
at State Bird Provisions.

27:43.333 --> 27:45.500
Sorry. When I saw how things
were going earlier

27:45.583 --> 27:46.709
I made other plans.

27:46.792 --> 27:49.917
But now...well, shit.

27:52.000 --> 27:53.458
Tomorrow?

27:53.542 --> 27:54.834
Leaving first thing.
Another time.

27:59.959 --> 28:02.959
So, here's a chance
to earn my trust.

28:03.041 --> 28:07.792
What do you know
about asset forfeiture?

28:07.875 --> 28:11.500
You want to toot around
in a drug pusher's Ferrari,

28:11.583 --> 28:12.500

28:12.583 --> 28:15.417
I want to know how
assets might wind up...

28:15.500 --> 28:18.583
where they don't belong.

28:18.667 --> 28:20.208
There's "the
undercover brother."

28:20.291 --> 28:23.875
Requisition the asset for use
in a confidential investigation

28:23.959 --> 28:26.500
that lasts...as long
as you want it to.

28:26.583 --> 28:28.291
Want the item
out the door.

28:28.375 --> 28:29.750
Mm.

28:29.834 --> 28:32.875
What about running
the old empty auction play?

28:32.959 --> 28:35.208
Give insufficient notice
on the Marshals' site,

28:35.291 --> 28:37.667
then have a straw buyer
snatch up the thing for a song.

28:37.750 --> 28:39.583
Of course, you gotta
cajole a Marshal.

28:39.667 --> 28:43.000
But that's almost
its own reward.

28:43.083 --> 28:44.542
That.

28:44.625 --> 28:45.959
And do it

29:07.959 --> 29:10.667
Yeah, in the last day,
I found my grant under review,

29:10.750 --> 29:12.834
the lease on my lab
suddenly in question,

29:12.917 --> 29:14.583
nothing out of place at home--
though I still feel

29:14.667 --> 29:15.750
-like someone has been there.
-Huh.

29:15.834 --> 29:19.333
These tactics are
deeply objectionable.

29:19.417 --> 29:21.667
Well, you're
a diagnostician.

29:21.750 --> 29:23.834
So, before you form
a hypothesis,

29:23.917 --> 29:25.333
let alone
reach a conclusion,

29:25.417 --> 29:27.125
I thought you should
have all the data.

29:27.208 --> 29:30.291
Meaning that you can hurt me
as much as the government can.

29:30.375 --> 29:31.667
Who wants
to hurt anybody?

29:31.750 --> 29:33.000
All of this
is unnecessary.

29:33.083 --> 29:35.166
I told you:
I disposed of the slide.

29:35.250 --> 29:37.000
How?

29:37.083 --> 29:37.917
How?

29:38.000 --> 29:39.125

29:39.750 --> 29:41.834
Talk me through it.

29:41.917 --> 29:44.834
Okay. The slide was on my desk
in a plastic bag.

29:44.917 --> 29:46.667
You left,
I took the slide

29:46.750 --> 29:48.291
to my exam room.

29:48.375 --> 29:50.583
I was going to
put it in the biohazard bin,

29:50.667 --> 29:52.875
and then I
remembered it's emptied weekly

29:52.959 --> 29:55.208
and had just
been picked up that day.

29:55.291 --> 29:56.792
I didn't want the slide
sitting there for a week.

29:56.875 --> 29:58.458
Oh.
So you took it home?

29:58.542 --> 30:00.041
No.

30:00.125 --> 30:03.375
I went to my lab.
We have a kiln.

30:03.458 --> 30:04.458
That destroys slides?

30:04.542 --> 30:06.375
Russians
destroyed thousands

30:06.458 --> 30:09.208

samples that way.

30:09.291 --> 30:09.625
How did you get there?

30:09.709 --> 30:11.250
How did I--

30:11.333 --> 30:12.625
Did you fucking
beam yourself?

30:12.709 --> 30:14.542
I walked
down the hallway.

30:14.625 --> 30:16.959
Did you see anyone?

30:17.041 --> 30:18.041

Yes.

30:19.291 --> 30:22.083

30:22.166 --> 30:23.709
Did you say
anything to her?

30:23.792 --> 30:25.709
I just
kinda nodded.

30:25.792 --> 30:28.959
You need me
to demonstrate the nod?

30:29.041 --> 30:30.625
I'll let you know.

30:30.709 --> 30:33.667
I tossed it
in the kiln.

30:34.792 --> 30:37.417
That was that.
No one else there.

30:39.041 --> 30:41.083
That's very cautious
and precise.

30:41.166 --> 30:44.208
I swear
on my Hippocratic oath.

30:44.291 --> 30:45.333
You have to trust me.

30:45.417 --> 30:46.417
That's a very
credible story.

we aim to eliminate risk.

downside protection.
