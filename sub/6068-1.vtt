<i> the new Bermuda Triangle</i>
<i> with 31 cars and/or drivers</i>

<i> Seems the Golden Gears</i>

04:29.570 --> 04:32.337
Woman: Don't feel bad.
I'm a bad driver.

04:32.339 --> 04:33.572
Oh, fuck that.

04:33.574 --> 04:35.307
I won Junior Gold Gears
two years running.

04:35.309 --> 04:39.011
( giggles )

04:39.013 --> 04:40.646
Oh, yeah,
you're funny, huh?

04:40.648 --> 04:43.715
No. It just sounds like
a terrible experience.

04:43.717 --> 04:46.518
It must have been
really scary.

04:46.520 --> 04:48.787
You wanna see something
really scary?

04:48.789 --> 04:50.856
Um, what is it?

04:50.858 --> 04:53.625
Ah, it's better
if I show you.

05:05.472 --> 05:07.673
Asshole!

05:07.675 --> 05:08.707
That was really scary!

05:08.709 --> 05:10.409
Well, I told you.

05:10.411 --> 05:11.777
You could have killed us.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.780
You'll be fine.
We do it all the time.

05:17.817 --> 05:19.785
That's funny.

05:19.787 --> 05:21.586
Rachel couldn't
handle it either.

05:22.622 --> 05:24.356
Okay.

05:24.358 --> 05:26.091
Let's make it fun.

05:39.906 --> 05:41.406
Please don't kill me.

05:41.408 --> 05:43.642
I'm never even
been to California.

Hello? We've been in
a really bad accident.

06:45.506 --> 06:48.507
Please send help.

06:48.509 --> 06:50.776
We're on Ash Pine Road.

07:03.623 --> 07:05.424
Thank God.

07:25.745 --> 07:27.579
He hasn't moved.

07:27.581 --> 07:30.215
He's trapped.
Please hurry.

07:32.819 --> 07:34.753
Hello?

07:36.189 --> 07:38.557
Can you get him
out of there?

07:38.559 --> 07:40.459
Is he gonna be okay?

07:47.633 --> 07:48.867
Jordan?

08:07.487 --> 08:08.987

09:43.683 --> 09:46.885
Amy?

09:46.887 --> 09:47.953
Yeah?

09:47.955 --> 09:49.721
Could you grab
the mail, baby?

09:49.723 --> 09:52.757
Department said that Daddy's
last check was finally sent.

09:52.759 --> 09:55.293
Yeah, I got it.

09:55.295 --> 09:57.329
It's only been
eight months.

09:57.331 --> 09:58.797
You working today?

09:58.799 --> 10:00.231
No.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.233
Bill Higgins is supposed
to pop by

10:02.235 --> 10:05.670
with a tomato plant.

10:05.672 --> 10:07.973
Great.

10:16.015 --> 10:18.183
I have those same boxers.

10:29.161 --> 10:30.762
Thank you, Rachel.

10:30.764 --> 10:32.063
Got new movies.

10:40.673 --> 10:42.173
God, I love your mouth.

10:42.175 --> 10:44.643
Let's go.

10:44.645 --> 10:46.978
Nice underwear.
Real sexy.

10:46.980 --> 10:48.647
( laughs )

10:48.649 --> 10:49.748
Later, flapjacks.

10:49.750 --> 10:51.983
Hey, Jason.
Nice day, huh?

10:51.985 --> 10:54.085
Oh, what's on your lip?
It's a huge whore.

11:07.299 --> 11:09.267
Did I hear you talking
to somebody out there?

11:09.269 --> 11:11.903
No.

11:11.905 --> 11:13.071
Here's your mail.

11:13.073 --> 11:15.073
Thank you, baby.

11:15.075 --> 11:18.243
I thought maybe
it was Angel.

11:18.245 --> 11:20.211
Yeah. I don't think so.

11:20.213 --> 11:21.913
What happened?

11:21.915 --> 11:23.848
Nothing.

11:23.850 --> 11:26.785
She's too busy with
her new friends.

11:26.787 --> 11:28.787
I have too much going on,
though, anyway.

11:28.789 --> 11:30.255
Yes, you do.

11:30.257 --> 11:33.024
Have to get your essay
in their hands by the 15th.

11:33.026 --> 11:34.826
( sighs )

11:34.828 --> 11:38.063
My ticket out of
this town, thank God.

11:43.269 --> 11:46.037
Hey, Mom, do you think dad
would have loved you

11:46.039 --> 11:49.741
if you were like deformed

11:49.743 --> 11:53.078
or had flapjacks
or something?

11:53.080 --> 11:54.746
What?

11:54.748 --> 11:56.848
I don't know.
Never mind.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.383
What would make you
ask that, sweetie?

11:58.385 --> 12:01.486
Nothing, nothing.
Just drop it.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.221
Of course, your father
would have.

12:03.223 --> 12:06.825
He did.

12:06.827 --> 12:08.093
That's why he married me

12:08.095 --> 12:10.962
and not that bimbo
Judy DeZulla.

12:10.964 --> 12:13.398
Okay, Mom, we can't all be
as beautiful as you are.

12:13.400 --> 12:17.836
Honey, I'm sure whatever
is going on with you and
Angel is just a phase.

12:22.241 --> 12:24.843
What's his sudden interest
in you anyway?

12:24.845 --> 12:26.377
I mean, he only likes
skanks like Brooke.

12:26.379 --> 12:28.113
Well, I guess
I'm a skank then.

12:28.115 --> 12:30.181
Because he likes me.
And I like him.

12:30.183 --> 12:31.516
Brad?

12:31.518 --> 12:32.951
I mean, come on.

12:32.953 --> 12:34.285
He's such an asshole
'roid head.

12:34.287 --> 12:36.788
Amy, he's not!
He's really nice.

12:36.790 --> 12:37.789
If you would just give
him a chance...

12:37.791 --> 12:39.257
No, thanks.

12:39.259 --> 12:40.492
I'd rather die than hang out
with those douchebags.

12:40.494 --> 12:43.228
Everything's always
about you.

12:43.230 --> 12:47.031
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

12:56.876 --> 12:58.409
Amy?

12:58.411 --> 13:00.378
What?

13:00.380 --> 13:02.480
Just drop it.

13:06.452 --> 13:09.220
( screaming )

13:14.160 --> 13:15.460
( laughs )

13:15.462 --> 13:18.129
- ( tires screeching )
- ( screaming )

13:20.099 --> 13:22.233
Such a YouTube queen.

13:22.235 --> 13:25.503
I guess she is used to having
her legs open, isn't she?

13:25.505 --> 13:27.105
Unbelievable.

13:33.012 --> 13:34.312
Whoo!

13:38.050 --> 13:39.984
( shouting )

13:41.320 --> 13:43.121
- I wanna do it.
- You wanna do what?

13:43.123 --> 13:44.489
I wanna ride the space.

13:44.491 --> 13:46.991
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

13:46.993 --> 13:49.160
Okay.

13:49.162 --> 13:52.096
My baby's gonna
ride the space! Whoo!

13:52.098 --> 13:54.132
Woo-hoo-hoo!

14:00.840 --> 14:02.407
Wait. What.?

14:09.582 --> 14:11.449
Check it out!
Whoo-hoo!

14:11.451 --> 14:13.484
- I'm doing it!
- Whoo!

14:13.486 --> 14:14.853
Man!

14:18.524 --> 14:21.159
Stop.

14:21.161 --> 14:24.195
Babe?

14:24.197 --> 14:28.399
- Come on, baby.
- Look, stop! Seriously!

14:28.401 --> 14:29.567
Brooke, I'm driving!

14:29.569 --> 14:30.969
Guys?

14:30.971 --> 14:33.638
Easy, easy!

14:33.640 --> 14:34.606
Angel, Angel!

14:36.342 --> 14:39.244
Oh, shit!

14:39.246 --> 14:42.914
No, no, no, no!

14:42.916 --> 14:46.351
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no.

14:48.420 --> 14:50.555
No, no, no, no, no, no.

14:50.557 --> 14:52.390
You're okay, you're okay.

14:52.392 --> 14:54.459
<i> 9-1-1.</i>

14:54.461 --> 14:56.094
There's been an accident.

14:56.096 --> 14:58.296
( crying )

15:01.166 --> 15:03.101
We're gonna be in
so much trouble!

15:03.103 --> 15:04.235
Don't worry.
We'll be fine.

15:04.237 --> 15:07.171
We? What about her?

15:07.173 --> 15:09.040
Shit.

15:09.042 --> 15:11.009
( ambulance siren )

15:11.011 --> 15:12.977
About fucking time.

15:12.979 --> 15:14.212
- Tim, come on, man!
- What are we gonna say?

15:18.584 --> 15:20.318
What the fuck
are you doing?

15:20.320 --> 15:22.453
Let's just say she fell.

15:22.455 --> 15:24.555
How'd the fuck would she
fall out of a moving car?

15:24.557 --> 15:26.324
I don't know!

15:39.705 --> 15:42.340
She was always just
goofing off like that.

15:42.342 --> 15:45.243
So she climbed out
without anyone noticing?

15:45.245 --> 15:47.645
And just fell?

15:47.647 --> 15:49.380
I swear.

15:49.382 --> 15:51.149
- Dude, what happened?
- It was an accident.

15:51.151 --> 15:52.450
You! You!

15:52.452 --> 15:54.218
( yelling )

15:54.220 --> 15:56.587
It wasn't anyone's fault.
It was an accident!

15:56.589 --> 15:59.023
Cut the crap.

15:59.025 --> 16:00.358
Breathe! Relax!

16:00.360 --> 16:02.660
What took you guys so
long to get here?

16:02.662 --> 16:07.198
We got one ambulance
covering 300 square miles.

16:07.200 --> 16:08.967
Do the math.

16:18.544 --> 16:21.145
Amy:
In the past couple of months,

16:21.147 --> 16:25.016
Angel and I had grown apart.

16:25.018 --> 16:29.320
not because we didn't
want to see each other.

16:29.322 --> 16:34.092
But because she wanted
to try new things and grow.

16:34.094 --> 16:35.360
Your hair looks so good.

16:35.362 --> 16:36.728
I know, right?

16:36.730 --> 16:38.696
The guy who does hair
in Top Model did it.

16:38.698 --> 16:39.697
He's really good.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.466
Unreal.

16:41.468 --> 16:44.535
I'll remember her for
the free spirit that she was

16:44.537 --> 16:48.272
and how she taught me
the meaning of friendship.

16:48.274 --> 16:50.141
- Shut up!
- It's awesome.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.410
It's a funeral,
not a fashion show.

16:53.645 --> 16:57.048
I love you, Angel.

16:57.050 --> 16:59.150
I'm gonna miss you so much.

16:59.152 --> 17:01.586
( giggles )

17:01.588 --> 17:03.354
You're so bad.

17:05.491 --> 17:07.125
That was beautiful.

17:07.127 --> 17:10.328
All right now. I'm going
to get you out of here.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.798
But first, a few words about
automobile safety

17:13.800 --> 17:16.267
from Sergeant Higgins.

17:16.269 --> 17:18.202
I feel sick.

17:18.204 --> 17:20.038
That's because you're drinking
at 10:30 in the morning.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.772
Shut up!

17:21.775 --> 17:24.175
Thank you,
Principal Stockton.

17:24.176 --> 17:28.311
Obviously, not my
favorite part of the job.

17:28.314 --> 17:32.517
Statistics show
that vehicle crashes

17:32.519 --> 17:36.054
are the number one cause
of death in this country.

17:36.056 --> 17:37.655
So I know you're out
there having a good time.

17:37.657 --> 17:39.257
And you're texting.
And you're jamming.

17:39.259 --> 17:40.358
And you're rockin'
out to the radio.

17:40.360 --> 17:41.559
But let me tell
you something,

17:41.561 --> 17:43.428
by the time I get there,
the fun is over

17:43.430 --> 17:45.163
and what I see is
not so pretty.

17:45.165 --> 17:49.067
So could you please just
keep in mind, please,

17:49.069 --> 17:52.503
that a car is not

17:52.505 --> 17:54.205
a toy.

17:59.711 --> 18:02.613
Hey, good job in there.

18:02.615 --> 18:04.182
It was really nice.

18:04.184 --> 18:06.284
I'm sorry.

18:06.286 --> 18:08.486
Thanks.

18:13.125 --> 18:15.359
Hey, Mary.

18:15.361 --> 18:16.761
Hey, Amy.

18:16.763 --> 18:20.865
I just wanted to personally
give you my condolences.

18:20.867 --> 18:24.402
Those kids friends
of yours too?

18:24.404 --> 18:25.837
Not at all.

18:25.839 --> 18:27.772
That's good because I think
Angel would have fared

18:27.774 --> 18:29.640
a little bit better if
she hadn't been friends
with them either.

18:29.642 --> 18:32.243
Do you suspect that there
is more to their story than...

18:32.245 --> 18:33.678
Following up on
a couple of things.

18:36.782 --> 18:38.382
We're gonna go.

18:38.384 --> 18:42.420
Right.

18:42.422 --> 18:45.189
- See you soon.
- Yeah.

18:45.191 --> 18:48.826
Oh, and, Amy, you need
anything, don't hesitate
to call day or night, okay?

18:50.662 --> 18:54.799
I always promised your
father I'd watch after you.

18:54.801 --> 18:57.135
He would have done
the same for me.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.736
Well, I'm fine.

18:58.738 --> 19:00.338
Okay.

19:12.184 --> 19:14.418
( crying )

19:22.828 --> 19:26.364
<i> ¶ Keep me inside ¶</i>

19:30.269 --> 19:33.804
<i> ¶ See you in time ¶</i>

19:37.509 --> 19:40.778
<i> ¶ Wait by my side ¶</i>

19:44.783 --> 19:47.919
<i> ¶ Wait for sunshine ¶</i>

19:50.489 --> 19:52.590

19:52.592 --> 19:54.859
<i> ¶ To get where you wanna go ¶</i>

19:57.729 --> 20:01.933
<i> ¶ If you take it day by day,</i>

20:04.970 --> 20:09.440
<i> ¶ Though the path is rough</i>

<i> a heavy load ¶</i>

20:12.678 --> 20:16.581
<i> ¶ Soon, you'll find your way</i>
<i> onto the better road ¶</i>

20:21.386 --> 20:26.324
<i> ¶ 'Cause it won't take long</i>
<i> to get where you wanna go ¶</i>

20:28.594 --> 20:32.730
<i> ¶ If you take it day by day,</i>
<i> yeah, you take it slow... ¶</i>

20:39.972 --> 20:42.573
God damn it!

20:42.575 --> 20:44.875
Why does nothing work
in this office?

20:44.877 --> 20:46.444
What's the problem?

20:46.446 --> 20:47.778
Stupid mouse.

20:47.780 --> 20:49.714
The mouse is stupid.

20:49.716 --> 20:52.650
Listen, by the way,
there's this kid, Jordan Banks.

20:52.652 --> 20:54.385
He went away
for the weekend

20:54.387 --> 20:56.287
and didn't check in
with his mommy yet.

20:56.289 --> 20:57.955
Big surprise there.

20:57.957 --> 21:00.625
His mom's been up my dick hole
like a goddamned kangaroo.

21:00.627 --> 21:03.661
Sounds painful.

21:03.663 --> 21:05.563
It is.

21:08.467 --> 21:12.503
I just don't get guys.
I think they're all jerks.

21:12.505 --> 21:14.972
Some are, kid.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.440
( chuckles )

21:16.442 --> 21:18.276
Not all of them.

21:18.278 --> 21:20.578
You got home late again
last night.

21:20.580 --> 21:23.414
Mm-hmm.

21:23.416 --> 21:26.584
You and your new boyfriend
must be having quite
the time together.

21:26.586 --> 21:28.753
Archie's not
my boyfriend.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.055
But thank you for asking.

21:31.057 --> 21:33.958
So do we have step dad
material here or what?

21:33.960 --> 21:37.728
What are you doing?

21:37.730 --> 21:39.497
I'm sorry. I'm just...

21:44.903 --> 21:47.972
I miss Dad.

21:47.974 --> 21:50.741
I know.

21:50.743 --> 21:52.543
Me too.

21:55.981 --> 21:59.850
And now with Angel,

21:59.852 --> 22:02.653
I can't imagine.

22:08.694 --> 22:10.528
You know what I was thinking
about the other day?

22:10.530 --> 22:12.430
What?

22:12.432 --> 22:15.766
Do you remember
the July 4th Fair?

22:15.768 --> 22:17.468
Of course.

22:17.470 --> 22:19.036
- The fireworks?
- The fireworks.

22:19.038 --> 22:20.538
( laughing )

22:20.540 --> 22:24.075
They were so low
and I was so lost.

22:24.077 --> 22:27.011
Daddy jumped on you
like you were on fire.

22:34.453 --> 22:37.021
I just don't get
what he sees in her.

22:37.023 --> 22:38.723
Who?

22:38.725 --> 22:41.492
Jason.

22:47.566 --> 22:49.667
Okay, if you like
him so much,

22:49.669 --> 22:51.469
why don't you just
ask him to chill?

22:51.471 --> 22:53.437
Chill, Mom?

22:53.439 --> 22:54.939
What? I can't say chill?

22:54.941 --> 22:57.808
No, you can.

22:57.810 --> 22:59.110
It's just...

22:59.112 --> 23:03.414
I just, um, I wanted
to run something by you.

23:03.416 --> 23:05.383
- Okay.
- ( doorbell rings )

23:05.385 --> 23:07.051
Hold that thought.

23:08.920 --> 23:10.821
I think I want a boob job.

23:12.157 --> 23:14.458
A boob job?

23:14.460 --> 23:17.461
I thought you were doing so
well with your jazzercise tapes.

23:17.463 --> 23:20.131
It's cardio kickboxing, Mom.
And it's not enough.

23:20.133 --> 23:23.834
But, baby, you're so
beautiful the way you are.

23:23.836 --> 23:25.636
Can't we at least
talk to Dr. Monroe?

23:25.638 --> 23:27.171
We'll talk about this
in a bit, okay?

23:27.173 --> 23:28.873
( doorbell rings )

23:30.142 --> 23:31.909
Phil?

23:31.911 --> 23:33.978
Hi. Come on in.

23:33.980 --> 23:34.979
Thanks.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.814
What brings you by?

23:36.816 --> 23:40.418
Well, actually, I wanted
to talk to Amy.

23:42.154 --> 23:45.990
So what do you know
about Jordan Banks?

23:45.992 --> 23:48.926
That he's
a walking STD?

23:48.928 --> 23:50.060
Amy!

23:50.062 --> 23:51.862
( chuckles )
All right.

23:51.864 --> 23:53.164
Any idea where he might be?

23:53.166 --> 23:55.599
No, not a clue.

23:55.601 --> 23:56.967
Why do you ask?

23:56.969 --> 23:59.503
Well, his folks filed
a missing persons.

23:59.505 --> 24:02.706
And I didn't know if there
was any word on the street
as to his whereabouts.

24:02.708 --> 24:06.010
Hopefully, well,

24:06.012 --> 24:07.778
hopefully, there's nothing
to be concerned about.

24:07.780 --> 24:10.114
We are hardly concerned.

24:10.116 --> 24:13.751
Amy, what has
gotten into you?

24:18.190 --> 24:20.524
I can't stop
thinking about Angel.

24:20.526 --> 24:22.726
Well, stop.

24:22.728 --> 24:23.928
What if somebody
finds out?

24:23.930 --> 24:25.029
We could be in deep shit.

24:25.031 --> 24:27.231
Oh, the dead don't speak, J.

24:27.233 --> 24:29.700
Let it die.
They did.

24:29.702 --> 24:31.168
How do you sleep at night?

24:31.170 --> 24:32.636
Naked.

24:32.638 --> 24:34.638
What is wrong with you?

24:34.640 --> 24:36.740
What's wrong with me is
that you're acting like
a little bitch.

24:36.742 --> 24:39.210
Brooke, this is serious.

24:39.212 --> 24:43.180
I'm sure your little friend,
Amy, would love to know
how serious it is.

24:43.182 --> 24:44.949
Are you kidding?

24:44.951 --> 24:46.050
You can't
just threaten me.

24:46.052 --> 24:47.551
Oh, no?

24:47.553 --> 24:48.853
It's not your place
to tell her anything.

24:48.855 --> 24:50.988
I can do whatever
I want to do, okay?

24:50.990 --> 24:54.258
I'm laying here being
all hot and stuff.

24:54.260 --> 24:58.062
And you're over there whining
about all this bullshit!

24:58.064 --> 25:00.097
No, Brooke. I'm just sick
of playing this game.

25:00.099 --> 25:02.533
( sighs )
I gotta go.

25:02.535 --> 25:05.736
I'm gonna have to touch
myself since you can't
seem to handle it.

25:05.738 --> 25:08.072
- You're the Devil.
- Bye, little bitch!

25:24.289 --> 25:26.557
Is that what
you're gonna wear?

25:28.760 --> 25:30.294
No.

25:30.296 --> 25:33.297
Maybe just something you just
slip easily on and off, yeah?

25:33.299 --> 25:37.167
<i> ¶ This love was never easy ¶</i>

25:37.169 --> 25:40.304
<i> ¶ But something's faded</i>
<i> inside of your heart ¶</i>

25:40.306 --> 25:43.807
<i> ¶ So you're crusading</i>
<i> to tear us apart. ¶</i>

25:43.809 --> 25:48.078
Amy, you look to be a
perfect candidate for
breast augmentation.

25:48.080 --> 25:49.146
Great.

25:49.148 --> 25:50.814
Thank you, Dr. Monroe.

25:50.816 --> 25:53.817
Now, Mary, you know
you can call me Dennis.

25:53.819 --> 25:56.153
Of course.

25:56.155 --> 25:57.888
You can call me
anything you want.

25:57.890 --> 25:59.990
Just don't call me
late for supper.

25:59.992 --> 26:02.293
( chuckles )

26:02.295 --> 26:04.728
So how soon can we schedule?

26:04.730 --> 26:06.864
Oh, let me see.

26:06.866 --> 26:10.167
Looks like I have a
cancellation on the 15th.

26:10.169 --> 26:11.635
Does that work?

26:11.637 --> 26:13.170
That's...

26:13.172 --> 26:15.339
Yes, I'll take it.

26:15.341 --> 26:17.074
Soon.

26:22.614 --> 26:26.584
<i> ¶ We become everything ¶</i>

26:26.586 --> 26:30.854
<i> ¶ We create aside ¶</i>

26:30.856 --> 26:35.059

26:35.061 --> 26:39.363
<i> ¶ Shadows that</i>
<i> open our eye ¶</i>

26:43.068 --> 26:44.702
Your hair looks awesome.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.971
Thanks. Didn't want it to
be too obvious.

26:46.973 --> 26:48.806
God, no,
it's totally subtle.

26:51.042 --> 26:52.676
What's Jason wearing
to the party?

26:52.678 --> 26:54.244
Oh, if I even invite him.

26:54.246 --> 26:55.779
Really?

26:55.781 --> 26:57.348
I guess Jordan's not
gonna be there either.

26:57.350 --> 26:58.949
Now that he's missing.

26:58.951 --> 27:00.050
( chuckles )

27:00.052 --> 27:01.385
Ugh, guys are so annoying.

27:01.387 --> 27:03.120
So are their mothers.

27:03.122 --> 27:05.289
She will not stop
calling me.

27:05.291 --> 27:06.857
Zip it up, chatty.

27:06.859 --> 27:09.326
I am.

27:10.996 --> 27:13.797
I think it's about time
that I hang out with Brad.

27:13.799 --> 27:16.333
I think he's perfection.

27:16.335 --> 27:18.335
He's kind of gay.

27:18.337 --> 27:21.739
He's not gay.
It was a rumor.

27:21.741 --> 27:23.807
I started it.

27:23.809 --> 27:25.843
Oh!

27:25.845 --> 27:27.011
He's not gay.

27:27.013 --> 27:28.278
I'm sure you would know.

27:28.280 --> 27:30.247
Not yet.

27:30.249 --> 27:32.750
Skank.

27:32.752 --> 27:34.885
( chattering )

27:43.428 --> 27:46.196
<i> ¶ Growing up I was</i>
<i> an outcast ¶</i>

27:48.733 --> 27:51.201
<i> ¶ Never was quite</i>

27:53.138 --> 27:54.138
Amy?

27:54.140 --> 27:55.773
Hey, Jason.

27:55.775 --> 27:56.974
How are you?

27:56.976 --> 27:58.275
I'm okay.

27:58.277 --> 27:59.943
Man:
What's up, Jason?

27:59.945 --> 28:04.048
So are you going
to Brooke's?

28:05.784 --> 28:07.317
Yeah. Something
I gotta take care of.

28:07.319 --> 28:09.386
Is there?

28:09.388 --> 28:11.989
Only one way to find out.

28:11.991 --> 28:14.992
Come with me.

28:14.994 --> 28:17.061
Come on.

28:31.443 --> 28:33.410
<i> ¶ I'm flying away ¶</i>

28:33.412 --> 28:36.847

we could rise above ¶

29:31.270 --> 29:34.404
¶ You say you're missing me
We're both in agony ¶

29:34.406 --> 29:38.041
¶ Or is it just the thought
of someone else having me ¶

29:41.546 --> 29:43.814
Have you heard
from Jordan?

29:43.816 --> 29:45.382
His mom will not
stop calling me.

29:45.384 --> 29:47.284
Yeah, same here.

29:47.286 --> 29:49.486
I thought she wanted to hook up
with some of that young meat.

29:49.488 --> 29:51.955
Hey!

29:51.957 --> 29:56.026
I think he took that chick,
Sam, to the Golden Gears
Muscle Car Extravaganza!

29:56.028 --> 29:59.463
Wait? That little jailbait slut
from the pizza place?

29:59.465 --> 30:01.231
- Yeah.
- She's like 15 years old.

30:01.233 --> 30:03.901
Oh, but have you
seen that ass?

30:03.903 --> 30:05.269
Gross, Spaz, gross.

30:05.271 --> 30:07.938
Excuse me?
She's a nobody.

30:07.940 --> 30:09.940
She's a nobody.

30:15.113 --> 30:17.514
Ow, why do you
keep doing that?

30:17.516 --> 30:19.283
See?

30:19.285 --> 30:21.084
It'll be fine, I promise.

30:21.086 --> 30:22.186
Let me go get us
some drinks.

30:22.188 --> 30:25.322
Hey, Red Riding Hood.
You lost?

30:25.324 --> 30:27.157
I think I'm gonna go.

30:27.159 --> 30:29.259
- You guys talking
about me over here?
- No.

30:29.261 --> 30:30.494
Oh, this should be
a train wreck.

30:30.496 --> 30:33.363
Then maybe you were
talking about Angel.

30:33.365 --> 30:35.199
And her "accident".

30:35.201 --> 30:37.534
- Brooke...
- Oh, that's right.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.270
The loser sisters
were friends.

30:40.272 --> 30:41.271
Yeah. Let's go.

30:41.273 --> 30:42.539
Hey, where you going?

30:42.541 --> 30:44.508
Yeah, well, not here.
Later, J.

30:44.510 --> 30:46.877
What do you mean, "accident"?

30:46.879 --> 30:49.279
Don't put your fingers
where they don't belong.

30:49.281 --> 30:50.914
- You might lose them.
- What?

30:50.916 --> 30:52.883
Brooke, stop!
You're drunk!

30:52.885 --> 30:54.551
The bitch thing is getting
kind of old, all right?

30:54.553 --> 30:56.053
It's not the 80s anymore.

30:56.055 --> 30:58.922
Go drive your scooter
into a tree and film it!

30:58.924 --> 31:01.491
Nobody would care,
especially not Rachel!

31:01.493 --> 31:04.528
And you, Mr. Innocent.

31:04.530 --> 31:05.996
Don't act like Angel
was your first.

31:05.998 --> 31:08.365
What?

31:08.367 --> 31:11.301
Tell me you and Jordan didn't
leave that little old lady
for dead in the woods.

32:02.253 --> 32:04.121
( screams )

32:04.123 --> 32:06.290
Oh, shit!

32:11.562 --> 32:12.930
Oh, my God!

32:12.932 --> 32:14.064
What'll we do?

32:14.066 --> 32:15.132
I'm getting
the hell outta here.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.533
We have to wait
for the police!

32:16.535 --> 32:18.468
- Fuck that!
- We can't just
leave her here!

32:18.470 --> 32:21.305
You wanna do five to ten for
manslaughter, be my guest, pal!

32:21.307 --> 32:22.940
- Not me!
- He's right, Jason.

32:22.942 --> 32:24.174
Look, she's old.

32:24.176 --> 32:25.542
She probably had
a good life.

32:25.544 --> 32:27.511
We can't go to jail!
Come on, let's go!

32:27.513 --> 32:29.579
Shit!

33:03.681 --> 33:05.415
Is it true?

33:05.417 --> 33:07.517
Baby, you better
believe it's true.

33:07.519 --> 33:11.421
He's a real piece of shit.
Just like the rest of us.

33:11.423 --> 33:13.056
I can't believe it.

33:13.058 --> 33:15.392
Why? 'Cause you loved him?

33:17.428 --> 33:18.628
( crying )

33:18.630 --> 33:21.198
Hey.

33:21.200 --> 33:22.699
Fuck, Brooke!

33:22.701 --> 33:24.267
- What?
- What?

33:24.269 --> 33:28.238
You're gonna get us all
arrested for starters!

33:28.240 --> 33:30.073
What is wrong with you?

33:30.075 --> 33:32.142
Anyways.

33:34.445 --> 33:36.380
Brad, it's Tim.

33:36.382 --> 33:39.249
Brooke has lost
her shit, okay?

33:39.251 --> 33:43.787
She's just spewing words
in front of everybody.

33:43.789 --> 33:46.089
Chaos. Call me back.

34:02.040 --> 34:03.640
( cell phone rings )

34:06.411 --> 34:08.378
Are you gonna get that?

34:08.380 --> 34:10.580
Just ignore it.

34:10.581 --> 34:13.083
You want me?

34:13.085 --> 34:15.052
You know I do.

34:15.054 --> 34:16.585
You think I'm hot?

34:16.588 --> 34:19.322
Yeah.

34:19.324 --> 34:20.657
Tell me I'm hot.

34:20.659 --> 34:23.460
You're so fucking hot.

34:25.663 --> 34:27.797
Am I hotter than Brooke?

34:27.800 --> 34:30.167
Yeah, you're so hot.

34:30.168 --> 34:33.170
Yeah, but tell me
I'm hotter than Brooke.

34:33.172 --> 34:34.371
You're hotter than Brooke.

34:34.373 --> 34:36.139
Yeah?

34:43.246 --> 34:45.282
( clattering )

34:45.284 --> 34:47.684
Wait!

34:47.686 --> 34:50.754
What was that?

34:50.755 --> 34:52.422
I don't hear anything.

34:52.424 --> 34:53.723
Brad, seriously.

34:53.725 --> 34:55.458
What?

34:55.460 --> 34:57.160
Just look.

34:57.162 --> 34:58.462
I'm looking.

34:58.464 --> 35:00.497
Yeah, I don't
see anything.

35:00.499 --> 35:03.166
Babe, don't worry.

35:03.168 --> 35:05.469
I'll protect you.

35:16.714 --> 35:19.649
She shouldn't have been
running her mouth where
she doesn't belong.

35:19.651 --> 35:21.251
How dare you bring
her here, by the way!

35:21.253 --> 35:22.786
She's nice!

35:22.788 --> 35:24.588
Maybe you'd realize that if
you could get over yourself!

35:28.626 --> 35:30.894
No wonder your
parents hate you.

35:30.896 --> 35:32.829
Get the fuck out
of my house!

35:32.831 --> 35:34.431
And don't come back till
you're ready to treat me

35:34.433 --> 35:37.300
the way I deserve
to be treated!

35:37.302 --> 35:39.669
I do treat you the way
you deserve to be treated.

35:55.486 --> 35:57.521
It's so fucking
hot in here.

35:57.523 --> 35:58.755
I'm ready to go now.

35:58.757 --> 36:00.290
Okay.

36:02.360 --> 36:03.360
Oh, fuck.

36:03.362 --> 36:04.794
( chuckles )

36:04.796 --> 36:05.829
( screams )

36:05.831 --> 36:07.297
Rachel?

36:07.299 --> 36:09.666
Rachel?
Rachel!

36:13.371 --> 36:15.238
( yelling )

36:16.507 --> 36:18.441
- Bitch!
- ( whirring )

36:18.443 --> 36:20.410
Rachel!

36:43.401 --> 36:44.701
Guys?

36:51.909 --> 36:53.276
Guys?

36:57.215 --> 36:58.848
Oh, shit.

37:02.386 --> 37:03.753
Rachel?

37:05.623 --> 37:07.490
Brad?

37:21.439 --> 37:22.939
Brad?

37:24.542 --> 37:26.309
( clattering )

37:29.680 --> 37:31.748
Rachel?

37:34.986 --> 37:36.686
Rachel?

38:32.343 --> 38:34.678
( exhaling )

38:42.353 --> 38:45.755
Damn it, boys.

38:45.757 --> 38:47.991
What have you gotten
yourselves into now?

38:47.993 --> 38:50.560
( crying )

38:59.770 --> 39:03.506
I told you not to go messing
around out there, didn't I?

39:03.508 --> 39:04.941
Please don't!

39:04.943 --> 39:07.977
It's not even that bad!

39:07.979 --> 39:09.079
( crying )

39:09.081 --> 39:10.647
Shut up.

39:23.361 --> 39:25.095
( muffled screaming )

39:28.933 --> 39:31.835
You're an animal!

39:31.837 --> 39:33.670
Mama's boy.

39:35.005 --> 39:36.906
( crying )

42:05.089 --> 42:08.191
( gasps ) Oh, my God!

42:12.830 --> 42:14.831
Shit!

42:26.176 --> 42:27.744
( screams )

42:32.316 --> 42:35.318
- Man: <i> Dispatch for 113. </i>
- Man #2: <i> Go for 113.</i>

42:35.320 --> 42:38.888
<i> Abandoned vehicle found</i>
<i> on Ash Pine Road by</i>
<i> the scrap yard.</i>

42:38.890 --> 42:40.957
<i> Yeah. On my way.</i>

43:08.752 --> 43:10.219
( banging )

43:13.023 --> 43:15.224
What's all the banging?
We're fuckin' closed!

43:15.226 --> 43:18.027
I wanna take a look around.

43:18.029 --> 43:20.363
Got a call about
a missing car

43:20.365 --> 43:22.332
and some missing kids.
You seen anything?

43:22.334 --> 43:25.969
Once they're behind
this gate, it's too late.

43:25.971 --> 43:29.005
For the wrecks, that is.

43:29.007 --> 43:30.640
Yeah, yeah.
Just open up.

43:30.642 --> 43:32.041
Yes, sir, Officer.

43:40.184 --> 43:41.884
Come on in.

43:48.892 --> 43:50.860
Have any visitors
last night?

43:50.862 --> 43:53.296
Nope.

43:56.166 --> 43:58.368
Pretty early to be
working, isn't it?

43:58.370 --> 44:00.837
Cars ain't gonna crush
themselves.

44:00.839 --> 44:03.172
No. No, I guess
they wouldn't.

44:05.009 --> 44:07.110
Place fuckin' stinks.

44:07.112 --> 44:08.277
Cesspool's full.

44:11.181 --> 44:14.283
You run an ambulance
service out of here?

44:14.285 --> 44:15.952
The old man was.

44:15.954 --> 44:17.820
Medic in the war.

44:17.822 --> 44:20.790
Guess he missed
the smell of blood.

44:20.792 --> 44:23.292
Yeah, yeah,
what's not to miss?

44:35.739 --> 44:38.007
What have you done?

44:38.009 --> 44:39.976
I'm a paramedic.

44:39.978 --> 44:42.445
Not anymore, you're not.

44:47.418 --> 44:49.786
We about done
here, Officer?

44:49.788 --> 44:51.888
Yeah.

44:51.890 --> 44:53.356
Yeah, I think so.

44:57.761 --> 44:59.696
( scraping )

44:59.698 --> 45:01.864
What was that?

45:01.866 --> 45:03.700
Raccoons.

45:03.702 --> 45:05.702
You know,
we got loads of 'em.

45:08.138 --> 45:10.707
Jesus!

45:10.709 --> 45:13.342
You got anybody lurking
around back there?

45:13.344 --> 45:16.245
Nah, just me
and little brother.

45:16.247 --> 45:18.247
No one here
but us chickens.

45:18.249 --> 45:19.816
( chuckles )

45:19.818 --> 45:21.350
Isn't that right,
you big dummy?

45:21.352 --> 45:24.087
Let's see the chicken dance.
Come on.

45:24.089 --> 45:26.055
Come on.

45:26.057 --> 45:28.458
( laughs )

45:28.460 --> 45:31.427
Come on!
Let's see it!

45:35.199 --> 45:38.167
You big fuckin' retard!

45:38.169 --> 45:40.236
( laughs )

45:44.141 --> 45:47.376
Okay. Okay, fellas.

46:01.959 --> 46:04.193
All right, hold up.

46:04.195 --> 46:06.395
Let's fix that face
of yours.

46:10.434 --> 46:12.401
Bite down on this.

46:18.275 --> 46:21.010
( screams )

46:33.056 --> 46:36.259
Now I'm gonna fix
those teeth of yours.

46:36.261 --> 46:39.328
Don't worry.
I'm a paramedic.

46:41.131 --> 46:43.366
( screams )

46:50.541 --> 46:55.278
<i> Don't worry.</i>
<i> I'm a paramedic.</i>
<i> I'm a paramedic.</i>

47:33.483 --> 47:36.219
Honey, remember what
the doctor said.

47:36.221 --> 47:39.856
No food or drink for
24 hours before surgery.

47:39.858 --> 47:41.457
Mom, I know,
but my throat is so dry.

47:41.459 --> 47:42.859
Just one sip.

47:42.861 --> 47:44.227
One.

47:49.433 --> 47:52.001
God, it's horrible,
isn't it?

47:52.003 --> 47:56.939
Well, they probably got
what they deserved.

47:56.941 --> 47:58.608
All righty then.

48:03.647 --> 48:06.115
Well, tomorrow's the big day.

48:06.117 --> 48:07.583
You excited?

48:07.585 --> 48:10.419
Yeah, I guess so.

48:10.421 --> 48:14.257
But I had the worst
nightmare about it last night.

48:14.259 --> 48:17.593
Honey, if you don't feel
like going through with it,
we can always reschedule.

48:17.595 --> 48:20.129
No, I'm ready.

48:20.131 --> 48:23.299
I'm ready.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.368

48:47.357 --> 48:50.259
No, nothing came
in the mail.

48:51.295 --> 48:52.595
How's dad?

48:55.966 --> 48:59.568
Hello?
Shit. Hello?

48:59.570 --> 49:01.570
Sorry, it's bad reception.

49:01.572 --> 49:04.607
Well, I was just thinking that
maybe when you guys got back,

49:04.609 --> 49:08.444
I could like cook dinner
or something?

49:08.446 --> 49:11.080

- Shit! Hello?

49:11.082 --> 49:14.283

You guys got here fast.

50:18.649 --> 50:21.050
Is there some paperwork I
ought to fill out or something?

50:21.052 --> 50:23.419
Don't worry, sir.
I'm a paramedic.

50:24.654 --> 50:26.422
Give me my phone.

50:26.424 --> 50:28.224
Shh!

50:28.226 --> 50:31.560
I need to call
my parents.

50:31.562 --> 50:34.363
Don't worry.
We'll kill your parents.

We'll call your parents.

( phone rings )

52:25.810 --> 52:27.510
It's for you.

52:31.481 --> 52:32.715
Hello?

52:32.717 --> 52:34.216
Jason: <i> Hi. Amy?</i>

52:34.218 --> 52:35.584
Hi, Jason.

52:35.586 --> 52:37.219
<i> Just wanted</i>
<i> to say what's up.</i>

52:37.221 --> 52:38.787
You haven't been online
in a while

52:38.789 --> 52:40.923
and I haven't seen you
since Brooke's house.

52:40.925 --> 52:43.425
Oh, yeah.

52:43.427 --> 52:47.796
I'm kind of over
social networking.

52:47.798 --> 52:49.565
And being social.

52:49.567 --> 52:51.200
<i> So what's up?</i>

52:51.202 --> 52:53.469
<i> Hanging out with</i>
<i> your loser friends?</i>

52:53.471 --> 52:54.770
All right, before you
say anything else.

52:54.772 --> 52:57.173
I really want
to say I'm sorry.

52:59.176 --> 53:01.177
No, it's okay.
Me, too.

53:01.179 --> 53:02.578
I should have been able
to think for myself

53:02.580 --> 53:04.547
and not listen to those guys.

53:04.549 --> 53:07.550
I mean, I shouldn't have judged
you for having awful friends.

53:07.552 --> 53:09.919
( chuckles )
Yeah, they're awful.

53:09.921 --> 53:12.488
So how did it go with
Brooke after I left?

53:12.490 --> 53:13.622
Who now?

53:31.808 --> 53:34.410
Wow, that dress never
loved me

53:34.412 --> 53:37.279
the way it's loving you
right now.

53:37.281 --> 53:38.280
Thank you.

53:38.282 --> 53:39.982
( chuckles )

53:39.984 --> 53:42.618
So what time are
you heading out?

53:42.620 --> 53:45.254
He should be here
in a few minutes.

53:47.624 --> 53:48.624
What?

53:48.626 --> 53:50.626
I don't know.

53:50.628 --> 53:52.361
Don't you think Higgins
tries too hard?

53:52.363 --> 53:53.929
Be nice.
He's sweet.

53:53.931 --> 53:55.464
Well, he does.

53:55.466 --> 53:57.499
Like get over yourself,
Dirty Harry.

53:57.501 --> 54:02.371
I'm sorry, but not everybody
can fit into your ideal
mold of cool, Amy.

54:02.373 --> 54:05.841
Well, all I know is that if
I could do it, anyone can.

54:05.843 --> 54:07.876
Before, I had nothing.

54:07.878 --> 54:12.815
And now I have a
super cute boyfriend
who drives an amazing car.

54:12.817 --> 54:17.720
And you didn't remember to
send in your essay, did you?

54:20.457 --> 54:22.424
No.

54:22.426 --> 54:26.462
Well, I guess some things
are just more important
to different people.

54:26.464 --> 54:28.530
Why can't you just
be happy for me?

54:28.532 --> 54:31.367
I am, but I need you to be
able to deal with the fact

54:31.369 --> 54:35.004
that I'm friends
with other men.

54:35.006 --> 54:38.641
( knocking on door )

54:38.643 --> 54:40.542
Speak of the devil.

54:45.482 --> 54:47.683
Come on in.

54:47.685 --> 54:49.318
There's somebody
I want you to meet.

54:51.421 --> 54:53.822
So, Amy, this is Darryl.

54:53.824 --> 54:56.425
Darryl, this is my daughter,

54:56.427 --> 54:59.628
Amy, who I've been
telling you so much about.

54:59.630 --> 55:01.630
Hey.

55:03.800 --> 55:05.734
So, where'd you guys meet?

55:05.736 --> 55:07.903
( voice fades )

55:34.397 --> 55:36.899
Mom, what's wrong with him?

55:36.901 --> 55:38.567
Amy!

55:38.569 --> 55:40.569
You look awfully familiar.

55:40.571 --> 55:43.439
( car honks )

55:43.441 --> 55:47.343
That's Jason.
I'll see you later.

56:28.718 --> 56:30.853
Mom?

56:30.855 --> 56:32.788
Mom!

56:34.090 --> 56:36.125
Darryl: Jon Roy!

56:37.660 --> 56:39.962
( crying )

57:11.728 --> 57:14.830
<i> ( music over dialogue )</i>

57:31.014 --> 57:33.549
Darryl, where did you go?

57:44.227 --> 57:47.463
Come on. There's something
I want to show you.

57:59.776 --> 58:02.010
So what schools are
you looking at?

58:02.012 --> 58:05.013
Um, I was actually thinking
I was taking a year off.

58:05.015 --> 58:06.782
Really?

58:06.784 --> 58:08.484
Yeah.

58:08.486 --> 58:10.219
Yeah, fuck it.

58:10.221 --> 58:12.955
I mean, I don't want to be tied
down to school and schedules

58:12.957 --> 58:16.091
and professors
telling me what to do.

58:16.093 --> 58:19.995
You know, I just want
to drink beer.

58:19.997 --> 58:21.630
( chuckles )

58:21.632 --> 58:23.198
- Whoa!
- Shit!

58:23.200 --> 58:25.801
God, these shoes were $300.

58:25.803 --> 58:29.004
You'd think that
I could walk in them.

58:29.006 --> 58:30.205
What?

58:30.207 --> 58:33.275
Where is Amy?
Is she in there?

58:33.277 --> 58:36.812
I'm here.

58:36.814 --> 58:38.213
I'm just better.

58:38.215 --> 58:40.816
I thought you were
better before.

58:40.818 --> 58:44.887
I mean, you're beautiful.

58:44.889 --> 58:46.855
But?

58:46.857 --> 58:49.258
But you're acting
like an ass.

58:49.260 --> 58:52.261
What? I mean..

58:52.263 --> 58:54.930
I thought that this
is what you wanted.

58:54.932 --> 58:58.300
You thought I cared
how much your shoes cost?

58:58.302 --> 59:02.104
Okay, I guess I was
just trying to impress you.

59:02.106 --> 59:04.973
All right. Maybe just
don't try so hard.

59:04.975 --> 59:08.744
And besides,
I'm a sneaker guy.

59:17.854 --> 59:21.323
Come on. Let's go get
you that beer.

59:27.897 --> 59:30.999
Man:
Yeah, okay. Thanks.

59:31.001 --> 59:35.237
Hey, that search warrant
you requested was denied.

59:35.239 --> 59:36.772
Really?

59:36.774 --> 59:39.641
Guess the judge
thought better of it.

59:43.346 --> 59:44.913
We'll see about that.

59:52.755 --> 59:55.757
Man: You piece
of shit! Fuck you!

59:55.759 --> 59:59.194
What's going on here?

59:59.196 --> 01:00:01.897
I don't know.
Hope everything's okay.

01:00:02.932 --> 01:00:04.800
You big retard!

01:00:04.802 --> 01:00:07.302
What is going on in there?

01:00:13.142 --> 01:00:15.143
( screaming )

01:00:19.082 --> 01:00:20.849
( Amy shrieks )

01:00:29.892 --> 01:00:31.159
( screaming )

01:00:33.196 --> 01:00:35.063
Jason!

01:00:35.065 --> 01:00:36.732
Run!

01:00:41.270 --> 01:00:44.773
Hey, let's play
where's Amy's mommy!

01:01:16.839 --> 01:01:19.675
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:01:22.278 --> 01:01:24.813
Here, kitty, kitty, kitty.

01:01:33.189 --> 01:01:35.824
( tapping )

01:01:35.826 --> 01:01:37.726
Amy?

01:01:41.164 --> 01:01:43.465
Nobody's gonna help you, Amy.

01:02:01.150 --> 01:02:04.252
Bunch of self-entitled maggots!

01:02:04.254 --> 01:02:06.288
No common decency!

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:13.295
No consideration!

01:02:21.337 --> 01:02:24.406
You killed my mother,
you fuckin' bitch!

01:02:27.210 --> 01:02:29.111
Look, I just wanna talk.

01:02:33.116 --> 01:02:34.950
I'm not gonna hurt you.

01:02:37.120 --> 01:02:39.454
You don't have to hide.

01:02:41.858 --> 01:02:44.760
Gotta learn respect!

01:02:44.762 --> 01:02:47.462
Back in my day, we had manners!

01:02:47.464 --> 01:02:48.430
( grunts )

01:03:37.313 --> 01:03:39.514
Mom?

01:03:45.555 --> 01:03:47.923
No!

01:04:04.874 --> 01:04:07.075
( crying )

01:04:07.077 --> 01:04:09.044
Mom.

01:04:16.552 --> 01:04:18.520
Mom.

01:04:22.458 --> 01:04:24.326
( screams )

01:04:49.552 --> 01:04:52.320
( shouting )

01:04:52.322 --> 01:04:54.923
Start working on
those fuckin' floors!

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:57.359
Why don't you do
some fuckin' dishes?

01:04:57.361 --> 01:04:59.027
Shut the fuck up!

01:04:59.029 --> 01:05:02.397
All you do is sit around

01:05:02.399 --> 01:05:05.567
and praise fuckin' Jesus!

01:05:05.569 --> 01:05:08.603
( continues shouting )

01:05:12.275 --> 01:05:13.508
You piece of shit!

01:05:13.510 --> 01:05:15.644
Fuck you!
Fuck you!

01:05:21.651 --> 01:05:23.585
Don't hurt him.

01:05:23.587 --> 01:05:27.088
He was only tryin' to help me.

01:05:27.090 --> 01:05:31.459
Wait'll I get my goddamn
hands on you again!

01:05:31.461 --> 01:05:34.262
When I was away, I read
a lot of books, old man.

01:05:34.264 --> 01:05:35.630
A lot of fuckin' books!

01:05:35.632 --> 01:05:37.432
You can't fuckin' read!

01:05:37.434 --> 01:05:39.301
Oh, yeah?
You know what I can do?

01:05:39.303 --> 01:05:43.071
I can give you a transorbital
fuckin' lobotomy if I wanted to!

01:05:43.073 --> 01:05:44.940
- You piece of shit!
- ( whirring )

01:05:44.942 --> 01:05:46.675
( screaming )

01:05:54.116 --> 01:05:57.452
God bless us all!

01:06:09.265 --> 01:06:11.299
Darryl: Jon Roy!

01:06:31.620 --> 01:06:33.588
I'm gonna cut you
so deep your mother's

01:06:33.590 --> 01:06:36.091
gonna feel it in hell,
you little bitch!

01:06:46.035 --> 01:06:49.537
Hello?

01:06:49.539 --> 01:06:51.272
Somebody here?

01:07:19.168 --> 01:07:22.504
( screams )

01:07:45.361 --> 01:07:47.562
( Amy screaming )

01:07:47.564 --> 01:07:50.598
Help me, somebody,
please!

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.605
Hung, it's Higgins.

01:07:57.607 --> 01:07:59.441
Listen, I'm down here
at Jimmy's Scrap Yard.

01:07:59.443 --> 01:08:01.576
Send any available units
down here right now, okay?

01:08:01.578 --> 01:08:03.244
Immediately.

01:08:03.246 --> 01:08:04.712
Where is she?

01:08:04.714 --> 01:08:06.414
( Amy screams )

01:08:13.556 --> 01:08:16.157
Amy?

01:08:18.694 --> 01:08:20.828
Here, kitty, kitty.

01:10:01.197 --> 01:10:03.698
( gasps )

01:10:06.302 --> 01:10:07.802
Brooke?

01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:13.208
( footsteps )

01:10:17.479 --> 01:10:19.214
Come on, Amy.

01:10:20.816 --> 01:10:22.550
Come to Daddy.

01:10:26.956 --> 01:10:28.323
Brooke, come on.
We have to go.

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:30.858
I... I...

01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:33.394
Brooke, please, come on!

01:10:33.396 --> 01:10:35.396
Please, we have
to get out of here!

01:10:35.398 --> 01:10:37.498
Jon Roy!

01:10:37.500 --> 01:10:38.766
Jon Roy!

01:10:43.839 --> 01:10:45.607
( engine starts )

01:11:12.801 --> 01:11:14.702
Hello?

01:11:36.992 --> 01:11:39.460
( whimpering )

01:11:44.333 --> 01:11:45.933
Help me.

01:11:47.670 --> 01:11:49.671
( grunts )

01:11:56.679 --> 01:11:58.413
( crying )

01:12:12.628 --> 01:12:14.762
I'm gonna turn
you inside out.

01:12:36.618 --> 01:12:38.419
( grunts )

01:12:39.755 --> 01:12:41.522
( screams )

01:12:54.603 --> 01:12:56.738
No! Get off of me!

01:12:56.740 --> 01:12:58.539
Leave me alone!

01:12:58.541 --> 01:13:00.108
They coddle you.

01:13:00.110 --> 01:13:02.377
Driving around in fancy cars

01:13:02.379 --> 01:13:06.147
that daddy bought for you.

01:13:06.149 --> 01:13:08.983
No more beauty pageants
and reality shows!

01:13:08.985 --> 01:13:11.919
I'll show you
some fuckin' reality!

01:13:14.890 --> 01:13:19.727
Fuckin' trophies from
your scumbag parents!

01:13:19.729 --> 01:13:20.995
You know what?

01:13:20.997 --> 01:13:23.731
I'm gonna make you
look real pretty.

01:13:23.733 --> 01:13:26.934
Help, somebody!
Please!

01:13:28.103 --> 01:13:31.739
Don't worry.
I'm a paramedic.

01:13:31.741 --> 01:13:34.776
Somebody help, please!

01:13:38.914 --> 01:13:41.649
Get the fuck off me,
you big retard!

01:13:41.651 --> 01:13:43.518
What the fuck
are you doing?

01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.186
Stop it!

01:13:45.188 --> 01:13:47.688
What? Ah!

01:13:51.160 --> 01:13:53.594
No!
What the fuck?

01:13:58.867 --> 01:14:00.968
- ( grinding )
- ( screaming )

01:14:24.460 --> 01:14:26.794
( panting )

01:15:03.031 --> 01:15:05.800
What the hell
are you doing?

01:15:09.771 --> 01:15:10.872
( siren wailing )

01:15:10.874 --> 01:15:12.740
Are you okay?

01:15:17.779 --> 01:15:19.780
( screams )

01:15:21.617 --> 01:15:24.519
<i> ¶ Hold on, I'm coming ¶</i>

01:15:24.521 --> 01:15:26.854
<i> ¶ Sure fire, you're running ¶</i>

01:15:26.856 --> 01:15:29.624
<i> ¶ Across the meadow,</i>
<i> through the creeks ¶</i>

01:15:29.626 --> 01:15:32.593
<i> ¶ I'm no better than you ¶</i>

01:15:32.595 --> 01:15:35.129
<i> ¶ The hangman is coming ¶</i>

01:15:35.131 --> 01:15:38.232
<i> ¶ Sure fire, you're running ¶</i>

01:15:38.234 --> 01:15:41.002
<i> ¶ Before Loretta,</i>
<i> come to rest ¶</i>

01:15:41.004 --> 01:15:44.171
<i> ¶ I know better than you ¶</i>

01:15:52.714 --> 01:15:55.149
<i> ¶ That stolen note,</i>

<i> ¶ Best stay awake,</i>
<i> I'm coming ¶</i>

01:15:58.087 --> 01:16:00.922
<i> ¶ Four stolen notes,</i>

<i> ¶ Now stay away,</i>

01:16:04.294 --> 01:16:08.629
