Your Empathically Reactive

00:13.291 --> 00:15.792
There's a situation in

00:13.291 --> 00:15.792
the Sigma launch hangar.

00:15.834 --> 00:18.166
Shall I play it for you

00:15.834 --> 00:18.166
on the monitor?

00:18.208 --> 00:19.417
No, thanks.

00:19.458 --> 00:22.583
From now on, Earth problems

00:19.458 --> 00:22.583
are not my problems.

00:22.625 --> 00:25.792
ERVIS, old pal, set coordinates

00:22.625 --> 00:25.792
for the silicon flats

00:25.834 --> 00:27.333
of Hydrus Four.

00:27.375 --> 00:30.291
Where the racing is fast,

00:27.375 --> 00:30.291
the energon is high-grade,

00:30.333 --> 00:33.542
and the locals never

00:30.333 --> 00:33.542
need rescuing.

00:33.583 --> 00:35.750
(  dramatic theme playing  )

00:38.834 --> 00:42.125
So let me get this straight.

00:38.834 --> 00:42.125
We actually want to find Blurr?

00:42.166 --> 00:44.125
He's supposed to be

00:42.166 --> 00:44.125
confined to quarters.

00:44.166 --> 00:46.083
Not that he ever does

00:44.166 --> 00:46.083
what he's supposed to.

00:46.125 --> 00:48.125
The guy just can't toe

00:46.125 --> 00:48.125
the line.

00:48.166 --> 00:50.417
Perhaps due

00:48.166 --> 00:50.417
to his lack of toes.

00:55.000 --> 00:56.625
( barks )

00:56.667 --> 00:58.917
Servo can't pick up

00:56.667 --> 00:58.917
his scent anywhere.

00:58.959 --> 01:00.417
Maybe he's not on

00:58.959 --> 01:00.417
the island.

01:00.458 --> 01:02.917
But Blurr told me

01:00.458 --> 01:02.917
he wasn't going to leave.

01:02.959 --> 01:06.041
Yeah, he's told us

01:02.959 --> 01:06.041
all lots of things.

01:06.083 --> 01:07.709
DANI:

01:06.083 --> 01:07.709
No one saw him board

01:06.083 --> 01:07.709
the ferry.

01:07.750 --> 01:09.709
And it's not like

01:07.750 --> 01:09.709
he can fly off the island.

01:11.542 --> 01:13.875
( Blades grunts )

01:13.917 --> 01:17.083
Whoa. Looks like

01:13.917 --> 01:17.083
I can't either.

01:17.125 --> 01:18.750
What was that?

01:18.792 --> 01:20.792

01:20.834 --> 01:23.291
Doc's been detecting

01:20.834 --> 01:23.291
some solar flare activity.

01:23.333 --> 01:25.333
When the radiation

01:23.333 --> 01:25.333
reaches our atmosphere,

01:25.375 --> 01:28.166
it can cause

01:25.375 --> 01:28.166

01:38.250 --> 01:41.125
Excuse me, Chief.

01:38.250 --> 01:41.125
I've never done that before.

01:41.166 --> 01:42.500
And I'm quite embarrassed.

That's all right,

we're asking questions,

04:18.750 --> 04:21.250
where's our spaceship?

04:25.834 --> 04:28.542
Next thing I knew,

04:25.834 --> 04:28.542
Blurr took off in the  Sigma.

04:28.583 --> 04:29.583
And I was trapped.

Grand theft,

Blurr did not even buckle up

04:33.709 --> 04:36.041
before lift off.

04:33.709 --> 04:36.041
He's reckless, all right.

04:36.083 --> 04:37.000

04:36.083 --> 04:37.000
a matter of time

before somebody really

gets hurt.

04:39.041 --> 04:40.583
I was hoping a little

04:39.041 --> 04:40.583
more time with us

04:40.625 --> 04:41.834

06:52.208 --> 06:55.917
What's going on here?

06:55.959 --> 06:59.208
Based on the solar flares we've

06:55.959 --> 06:59.208
been experiencing recently,

06:59.250 --> 07:01.500
I'd say it's a CME.

06:59.250 --> 07:01.500
That stands for--

07:01.542 --> 07:03.417
BOTH ( in unison ):

07:01.542 --> 07:03.417
Coronal Mass Ejection.

07:03.458 --> 07:05.917
Sort of a super solar flare.

07:05.959 --> 07:08.458
Much more powerful than

07:05.959 --> 07:08.458
the ones we felt earlier.

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
It disrupts

07:08.500 --> 07:10.500
electrical systems.

07:10.542 --> 07:13.333
And causes geomagnetic storms

07:10.542 --> 07:13.333
that affect everything,

07:13.375 --> 07:15.750
from radio signals

07:13.375 --> 07:15.750
to orbital satellites.

07:15.792 --> 07:17.583
So it shuts down

07:15.792 --> 07:17.583
all the power.

07:17.625 --> 07:19.583

07:39.375 --> 07:41.500
The effects are starting

07:39.375 --> 07:41.500
to wear off.

07:41.542 --> 07:43.417
( grunts )

07:43.458 --> 07:46.417
(  dramatic theme playing  )

07:46.458 --> 07:49.250
Some of our non-essential

07:46.458 --> 07:49.250
systems are still out.

07:49.291 --> 07:50.959
Lights, sirens.

07:51.000 --> 07:53.291
Which means we'll be

07:51.000 --> 07:53.291
out of touch and in the dark.

07:53.333 --> 07:55.834
So let's be extra careful

07:53.333 --> 07:55.834
out there.

07:55.875 --> 07:58.166
Dad, can Salvage

07:55.875 --> 07:58.166
and I come too?

07:58.208 --> 08:00.875
No point in staring at blank

07:58.208 --> 08:00.875
screens in the Command Center.

08:00.917 --> 08:04.291
All right.

08:00.917 --> 08:04.291
Keep an eye on him, Salvage.

08:08.375 --> 08:10.041
Chase and I'll head out

08:08.375 --> 08:10.041
to Doc's

08:10.083 --> 08:11.792
and see what he knows

08:10.083 --> 08:11.792
about this.

08:11.834 --> 08:14.417
Everyone else,

08:11.834 --> 08:14.417
fan out and patrol the island.

08:14.458 --> 08:18.542
HEATWAVE:

08:14.458 --> 08:18.542
Ah, Rescue Bots,

08:14.458 --> 08:18.542
roll to the rescue.

08:18.583 --> 08:22.792
You want me to fly?

08:18.583 --> 08:22.792
With no lights? No navigation?

08:22.834 --> 08:25.458
In my weakened condition?

08:25.500 --> 08:27.291
( coughs )

08:27.333 --> 08:29.041
Aw, it's okay.

08:29.083 --> 08:31.709
If you're too weak,

08:29.083 --> 08:31.709
I'll take the controls.

08:31.750 --> 08:34.625
I've been wanting to try

08:31.750 --> 08:34.625
a triple backwards loop, so...

08:34.667 --> 08:36.917
Feeling better already.

08:36.959 --> 08:40.500
Energon levels are

08:36.959 --> 08:40.500
coming back to normal.

08:40.542 --> 08:42.917
I'll be up to full throttle

08:40.542 --> 08:42.917
in no time.

08:42.959 --> 08:45.834
Uh-oh. I wish I could say

08:42.959 --> 08:45.834
the same for that plane.

08:45.875 --> 08:48.500
(  tense theme playing  )

08:52.625 --> 08:54.834
(  tense theme playing  )

08:55.792 --> 08:57.583
DANI:

08:55.792 --> 08:57.583
It's going down.

08:59.125 --> 09:01.959
The CME must have knocked out

08:59.125 --> 09:01.959
his navigation system.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.834
We have to help him land.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.834
We need to signal him.

09:04.875 --> 09:08.750
Are your lights working yet?

09:04.875 --> 09:08.750
No, my electrical's still down.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.291
I'll get his attention.

09:11.333 --> 09:13.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

09:16.041 --> 09:17.542
BLADES:

09:16.041 --> 09:17.542
Did I ever mention

09:17.583 --> 09:20.250
how flying backwards

09:17.583 --> 09:20.250
makes me nauseous?

09:21.375 --> 09:24.667
Just keep thinking about

09:21.375 --> 09:24.667
that sweet, safe ground.

09:31.583 --> 09:33.166
( tires skid )

09:36.959 --> 09:38.625
( sighs )

09:41.750 --> 09:43.792
( brakes squeal )

09:45.166 --> 09:46.709
(  tense theme playing  )

09:46.750 --> 09:48.709
Cody. We've lost power.

09:48.750 --> 09:50.834
She's adrift,

09:48.750 --> 09:50.834
and I can't control her.

09:57.333 --> 09:59.375
Just organized

09:57.333 --> 09:59.375
my rope collection this morning.

09:59.417 --> 10:02.000
Eighty feet.

09:59.417 --> 10:02.000
Reinforced nylon.

10:02.041 --> 10:04.333
(  dramatic theme playing  )

10:08.709 --> 10:10.208
Brace yourself, Captain.

10:22.458 --> 10:24.250
GREENE:

10:22.458 --> 10:24.250
Boulder's suspicions

10:22.458 --> 10:24.250
are correct.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.291
The phenomenon

10:24.291 --> 10:27.291
was indeed a CME.

10:27.333 --> 10:29.667
Its effects

10:27.333 --> 10:29.667
seem to be waning.

10:29.709 --> 10:32.542
But it's difficult to determine

10:29.709 --> 10:32.542
when we'll have power again,

10:32.583 --> 10:34.417
using only a calculator.

10:34.458 --> 10:37.792
Especially when it's running

10:34.458 --> 10:37.792
off a potato battery.

10:37.834 --> 10:40.500
GREENE:

10:37.834 --> 10:40.500
This works much better

10:37.834 --> 10:40.500
with an Idaho russet.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.709
Much starchier.

10:40.542 --> 10:43.709
But I had that for lunch.

10:43.750 --> 10:45.625
Once my calculations

10:43.750 --> 10:45.625
are done,

10:45.667 --> 10:48.959
I'll cross-check the CME's

10:45.667 --> 10:48.959
trajectory on my telescope.

10:49.000 --> 10:52.208
Then we can use the battery

10:49.000 --> 10:52.208
for home fries.

10:53.750 --> 10:55.750
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

10:58.125 --> 11:01.959
Ugh, what's it gonna take

10:58.125 --> 11:01.959
to get away from this mud ball?

11:04.291 --> 11:07.542
"In case of power loss,

11:04.291 --> 11:07.542

11:07.583 --> 11:08.959
( grunts )

11:09.000 --> 11:11.000
( spaceship whirring )

11:12.208 --> 11:13.417
( spaceship beeping )

11:13.458 --> 11:16.291
Again with the beeps.

11:16.333 --> 11:19.417
ERVIS:

11:16.333 --> 11:19.417
Should warn you about

11:16.333 --> 11:19.417
an unidentified object

11:19.458 --> 11:21.625
rapidly approaching

11:19.458 --> 11:21.625
our flight path.

11:24.375 --> 11:25.625
Whoa!

11:28.125 --> 11:31.875
Object has now been identified

11:28.125 --> 11:31.875
as a communications satellite.

11:31.917 --> 11:33.375
Impact is imminent.

11:33.417 --> 11:35.458
Ah, tell me something

11:33.417 --> 11:35.458
I don't know.

11:35.500 --> 11:38.625
All right. You now have

11:35.500 --> 11:38.625
10 unread messages

11:38.667 --> 11:40.250
from Optimus Prime.

11:40.291 --> 11:42.959
Forget that. Just take

11:40.291 --> 11:42.959
evasive action. Now.

11:46.458 --> 11:47.667
( sighs )

11:47.709 --> 11:49.000
( spaceship beeping )

11:49.041 --> 11:50.417
What now?

11:50.458 --> 11:52.125
The satellite

11:50.458 --> 11:52.125
has been disabled

11:52.166 --> 11:54.333
by a Coronal Mass Ejection.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.417
It's currently falling out

11:54.375 --> 11:56.417
of orbit

11:56.458 --> 11:59.417
and on a trajectory toward

11:56.458 --> 11:59.417
Griffin Rock, Maine.

11:59.458 --> 12:01.333
What?

11:59.458 --> 12:01.333
Griffin Rock, Maine.

12:01.375 --> 12:04.458
Uh, but it'll burn up

12:01.375 --> 12:04.458
before it crashes, right?

12:04.500 --> 12:07.458
ERVIS:

12:04.500 --> 12:07.458
Much of it may disintegrate

12:04.500 --> 12:07.458
upon re-entry,

12:07.500 --> 12:10.083
but some debris will hit

12:07.500 --> 12:10.083
the island.

12:10.125 --> 12:13.000
Estimating time

12:10.125 --> 12:13.000
of impact at...

12:13.041 --> 12:15.375
Thirty minutes. Oh, my.

12:15.417 --> 12:17.125
For the power

12:15.417 --> 12:17.125
to come back on?

12:17.166 --> 12:18.750
That's not a bad wait.

12:18.792 --> 12:20.417
Uh, no. That's how long

12:20.458 --> 12:22.250
until that satellite

12:20.458 --> 12:22.250
comes crashing down

12:22.291 --> 12:24.834
on Griffin Rock.

12:22.291 --> 12:24.834
What?

12:26.667 --> 12:29.000
Doc, can we raise

12:26.667 --> 12:29.000
the island's protective dome?

12:29.041 --> 12:31.291
Not without

12:29.041 --> 12:31.291
an energy source.

12:31.333 --> 12:32.834
Though it would appear

12:32.875 --> 12:34.583
that some power

12:32.875 --> 12:34.583
is beginning to return.

12:34.625 --> 12:38.417
But nowhere near enough

12:34.625 --> 12:38.417
to raise the Dome.

12:38.458 --> 12:40.083
At least my comm link's

12:38.458 --> 12:40.083
back up.

12:40.125 --> 12:41.709
I'd better alert the team.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.250
BURNS ( over comm ):

12:43.417 --> 12:45.250
Listen up.

12:43.417 --> 12:45.250
We have a situation.

12:45.291 --> 12:47.959
A falling satellite is headed

12:45.291 --> 12:47.959
straight for Griffin Rock.

12:48.000 --> 12:49.709
We'll just go up

12:48.000 --> 12:49.709
in the  Sigma...

12:49.750 --> 12:51.959
Oh. Right.

12:52.041 --> 12:53.959
HEATWAVE:

12:52.041 --> 12:53.959
Wasn't enough

12:52.041 --> 12:53.959
Blurr ditched us.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.625
He left us high and dry.

12:55.667 --> 12:57.625
BURNS ( over comm ):

12:55.667 --> 12:57.625
We can point fingers later.

12:57.667 --> 12:59.291
For now let's get everyone

12:57.667 --> 12:59.291
to shelter.

12:59.333 --> 13:00.542
( siren wailing )

13:00.583 --> 13:02.041
( whirring )

13:02.083 --> 13:03.792
BLADES ( over PA ):

13:02.083 --> 13:03.792
Attention, citizens.

13:03.834 --> 13:06.125
Please proceed to

13:03.834 --> 13:06.125
the underground shelter.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.750
This is not a drill.

13:15.166 --> 13:19.834
Salvage,

13:15.166 --> 13:19.834
shouldn't we be helping?

13:19.875 --> 13:23.500
I am helping. If I can boost

13:19.875 --> 13:23.500
the signal on our comm links,

13:23.542 --> 13:25.709
I may be able to get

13:23.542 --> 13:25.709
a message to Blurr.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.000
What good will that do?

13:25.750 --> 13:28.000
Blurr's made it pretty clear

13:28.041 --> 13:30.166
he's not interested

13:28.041 --> 13:30.166
in helping us.

13:30.208 --> 13:32.625
I know everybody else

13:30.208 --> 13:32.625
has given up on Blurr,

13:32.667 --> 13:34.542
but you know me.

13:34.583 --> 13:38.750
Some patience

13:34.583 --> 13:38.750
and a little tinkering...

13:38.792 --> 13:41.083
I like to give things

13:38.792 --> 13:41.083
a second chance.

13:41.125 --> 13:44.000
Or in Blurr's case,

13:41.125 --> 13:44.000
maybe a seventh or eighth.

13:44.041 --> 13:47.250
Hmm, see? You haven't

13:44.041 --> 13:47.250
given up on him either.

13:47.291 --> 13:51.959
There. This transmitter can find

13:47.291 --> 13:51.959
Cybertronian radio frequencies.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.333
Though it would work better

13:52.000 --> 13:54.333
on higher ground.

13:54.375 --> 13:56.417
How about Doc's lab?

13:56.458 --> 13:59.417
ERVIS, what's the situation

13:56.458 --> 13:59.417
in Griffin Rock.

13:59.458 --> 14:01.166
ERVIS:

13:59.458 --> 14:01.166
No updates.

14:01.208 --> 14:04.583
Signals there have become

14:01.208 --> 14:04.583
too weak to transmit to space.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.917
The other bots can handle it.

14:04.625 --> 14:07.917
The satellite wasn't my fault,

14:07.959 --> 14:09.875
so it's not my problem,

14:07.959 --> 14:09.875
right?

14:09.917 --> 14:12.625
ERVIS:

14:09.917 --> 14:12.625
I am not programmed

14:09.917 --> 14:12.625
to make judgments.

14:12.667 --> 14:16.166
I determine available options

14:12.667 --> 14:16.166
based on empathic input.

14:16.208 --> 14:20.458
But the current status

14:16.208 --> 14:20.458
of your feelings is...unclear.

14:20.500 --> 14:23.625
Shall I resume course

14:20.500 --> 14:23.625
for Hydrus Four?

14:23.667 --> 14:27.250
Sir, shall I resume course?

14:29.125 --> 14:30.667
(  dramatic theme playing  )

14:30.709 --> 14:34.000
ERVIS:

14:30.709 --> 14:34.000
Sir, shall I resume course?

14:34.041 --> 14:36.375
Ah, forget it.

14:34.041 --> 14:36.375
It's their problem.

14:36.417 --> 14:38.333
Yeah, ERVIS. Resume course.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.208
They'd sure be surprised,

14:41.333 --> 14:43.208
though,

14:43.250 --> 14:45.125
if I rode in

14:43.250 --> 14:45.125
to save the day.

14:45.166 --> 14:48.875
Except for the kid,

14:45.166 --> 14:48.875
he wouldn't be surprised.

14:48.917 --> 14:51.875
Okay, but I'm not

14:48.917 --> 14:51.875
giving up on you.

14:51.917 --> 14:54.000
Someday,

14:51.917 --> 14:54.000
when the time comes,

14:54.041 --> 14:56.792
I know you'll do

14:54.041 --> 14:56.792
the right thing.

14:56.834 --> 14:58.709
Ah, who am I kidding?

14:58.750 --> 15:01.500
Even if I wanted to, there's

14:58.750 --> 15:01.500
nothing I could do to help.

15:01.542 --> 15:04.208
Although,

15:01.542 --> 15:04.208
just for discussion's sake,

15:04.250 --> 15:05.959
if I were to go back,

15:06.000 --> 15:08.125
does this ship

15:06.000 --> 15:08.125
have laser blasters?

15:08.166 --> 15:12.792
ERVIS:

15:08.166 --> 15:12.792
Affirmative. Boulder and Graham

15:08.166 --> 15:12.792
recently installed a new one.

15:12.834 --> 15:14.709
All right,

15:12.834 --> 15:14.709
can't believe these words

15:14.750 --> 15:16.375
are about to leave

15:14.750 --> 15:16.375
my mouth, but--

15:16.417 --> 15:19.166
ERVIS:

15:16.417 --> 15:19.166
They don't need to, sir.

15:16.417 --> 15:19.166
I understand.

15:19.208 --> 15:21.291
Reverse course for Earth.

15:24.208 --> 15:25.834
BLURR:

15:24.208 --> 15:25.834
We're gonna chase down

15:24.208 --> 15:25.834
that satellite

15:25.875 --> 15:27.750
and blast it out of the sky.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.166
(  suspenseful theme playing  )

15:32.208 --> 15:34.917
Please proceed to

15:32.208 --> 15:34.917
the shelter single-file

15:34.959 --> 15:37.000
in an orderly manner.

15:39.041 --> 15:40.250
Aim the laser.

15:42.667 --> 15:44.375
And...fire.

15:46.000 --> 15:48.875
I said, fire!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.875
Why won't it work?

15:48.917 --> 15:50.792
ERVIS:

15:48.917 --> 15:50.792
Boulder and Graham have

15:48.917 --> 15:50.792
yet to bring

15:50.834 --> 15:53.500
the new laser cannon

15:50.834 --> 15:53.500
to full functionality.

15:53.542 --> 15:55.625
Well, why didn't you tell me

15:53.542 --> 15:55.625
that in the first place?.

15:55.667 --> 15:58.458
ERVIS:

15:55.667 --> 15:58.458
Your question was whether

15:55.667 --> 15:58.458
the ship was equipped

15:58.500 --> 16:00.625
with a laser cannon.

15:58.500 --> 16:00.625
Not whether or not it worked.

16:00.667 --> 16:03.250
Argh. Why is everybody

16:00.667 --> 16:03.250
against me?

16:03.291 --> 16:05.792
ERVIS:

16:03.291 --> 16:05.792
I have no internal data

16:03.291 --> 16:05.792
to answer that.

16:05.834 --> 16:07.250
Shall I search the Internet?

16:07.291 --> 16:08.750
Even when I try to do

16:07.291 --> 16:08.750
the right thing,

16:08.792 --> 16:11.500
I mess it up somehow.

16:08.792 --> 16:11.500
Now what I do?

16:11.542 --> 16:14.834
SALVAGE ( over comm ):

16:11.542 --> 16:14.834
First of all, stop feeling

16:11.542 --> 16:14.834
sorry for yourself.

16:14.875 --> 16:17.208
Salvage?

16:14.875 --> 16:17.208
Blurr, hang on.

16:17.250 --> 16:18.583
We'll get you some help.

16:18.625 --> 16:20.375
I'm patching you

16:18.625 --> 16:20.375
through to the others.

16:20.417 --> 16:22.041
(  dramatic theme playing  )

16:22.083 --> 16:24.375
BLURR ( over comm ):

16:22.083 --> 16:24.375
Uh, hey, guys.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.166
Well, if it isn't our hero.

16:24.417 --> 16:28.166
You sure have a lot of nerve.

16:28.208 --> 16:31.291
This frequency is for

16:28.208 --> 16:31.291
emergency personnel only.

16:31.333 --> 16:32.875
State your business, Blurr.

16:32.917 --> 16:34.500
BLURR ( over comm ):

16:32.917 --> 16:34.500
I need to know how to get

16:34.542 --> 16:35.917
the  Sigma's  laser cannon

16:34.542 --> 16:35.917
online.

16:35.959 --> 16:37.875
Oh, heh, why?

16:35.959 --> 16:37.875
You gonna come back

16:37.917 --> 16:40.333
and take a shot at us

16:37.917 --> 16:40.333
on top of everything else?

16:40.375 --> 16:43.667
Okay, I know I deserve that.

16:40.375 --> 16:43.667
I have a lot to answer for,

16:43.709 --> 16:47.333
but right now there's

16:43.709 --> 16:47.333
a satellite to take care of.

16:47.375 --> 16:49.625
Wait, wait, wait,

16:47.375 --> 16:49.625
Blurr is helping?

16:49.667 --> 16:51.792
BOULDER ( over comm ):

16:49.667 --> 16:51.792
Are you at

16:49.667 --> 16:51.792
the control console?

16:51.834 --> 16:54.834
There's a panel with a charging

16:51.834 --> 16:54.834
button and override switch.

16:54.875 --> 16:56.750
GRAHAM:

16:54.875 --> 16:56.750
But we didn't get

16:54.875 --> 16:56.750
to finish our upgrade,

16:56.792 --> 16:59.959
so the laser's operating at

16:56.792 --> 16:59.959
only 10 percent capacity.

17:00.000 --> 17:03.208
Well then, I'll just have to

17:00.000 --> 17:03.208
fly in 10 times closer.

17:03.250 --> 17:06.250
BOULDER ( over comm ):

17:03.250 --> 17:06.250
That'll put you in the path

17:03.250 --> 17:06.250
of the exploding debris.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.709
It could destroy the ship.

17:06.291 --> 17:08.709
And you.

17:08.750 --> 17:12.125
Well, at least I won't have to

17:08.750 --> 17:12.125
come back and face Heatwave.

17:16.083 --> 17:18.000
HEATWAVE ( over comm ):

17:16.083 --> 17:18.000
Blurr, you don't have

17:16.083 --> 17:18.000
to do this.

17:18.041 --> 17:20.000
Maybe we can figure out

17:18.041 --> 17:20.000
another way.

17:20.041 --> 17:21.333
( fake static noise )

17:21.375 --> 17:23.834
Uh, sorry, Heatwave,

17:21.375 --> 17:23.834
can't hear you.

17:23.875 --> 17:25.875
Uh, signal's breaking up.

17:29.542 --> 17:32.542
( spaceship beeping )

17:37.041 --> 17:40.125
Thirty seconds

17:37.041 --> 17:40.125
to satellite impact.

17:40.166 --> 17:42.166
(  dramatic theme playing  )

17:47.875 --> 17:49.875
( spaceship continues beeping )

17:51.625 --> 17:53.208
Blurr, you can do this.

17:54.834 --> 17:56.542
Five seconds

17:54.834 --> 17:56.542
to satellite impact.

17:57.959 --> 18:02.125
GREENE:

17:57.959 --> 18:02.125
Four...three...two...

18:08.458 --> 18:11.041
( all cheering

18:08.458 --> 18:11.041
and chattering )

18:12.583 --> 18:16.375
Heh, hey, wise guy,

18:12.583 --> 18:16.375
you did it.

18:16.417 --> 18:18.583
Blurr?

18:16.417 --> 18:18.583
The  Sigma's  gone.

18:18.625 --> 18:20.917
(  tender theme playing  )

18:20.959 --> 18:22.250
Poor Blurr.

18:22.291 --> 18:24.458
Well, he wasn't

18:22.291 --> 18:24.458
the nicest guy in the world.

18:24.500 --> 18:26.542
But even he

18:24.500 --> 18:26.542
doesn't deserve that.

18:26.583 --> 18:28.667
Ah, I was wrong about Blurr.

18:28.709 --> 18:31.333
He came through

18:28.709 --> 18:31.333
for the team in the end.

18:31.375 --> 18:33.208
He truly fulfilled

18:31.375 --> 18:33.208
the Rescue Bot pledge

18:33.250 --> 18:35.333
to serve and protect.

18:35.375 --> 18:37.250
BLURR ( over comm ):

18:35.375 --> 18:37.250
Uh, one more thing.

18:37.291 --> 18:39.083
How do you turn off

18:37.291 --> 18:39.083
this cloaking device?

18:39.125 --> 18:40.625
I think the explosion

18:39.125 --> 18:40.625
triggered it.

18:40.667 --> 18:42.500
Blurr?

18:40.667 --> 18:42.500
BLURR:  Oh, wait, never mind.

18:42.542 --> 18:44.291
Nope. I got it.

18:44.333 --> 18:46.083
(  triumphant theme playing  )

18:54.875 --> 18:58.041
I don't know whether

18:54.875 --> 18:58.041
to hug you or yell at you.

18:58.083 --> 19:00.417
Is there a third option?

19:00.458 --> 19:03.542
Yes. Court martial.

19:00.458 --> 19:03.542
For Grand Theft Spaceship.

19:03.583 --> 19:05.417
Hey, if I hadn't taken

19:03.583 --> 19:05.417
the ship,

19:05.458 --> 19:07.083
none of you

19:05.458 --> 19:07.083
would even be here.

19:07.125 --> 19:09.750
Feels good to help,

19:07.125 --> 19:09.750
doesn't it?

19:09.792 --> 19:11.375
I'm not sure.

19:11.417 --> 19:13.458
Never done it before.

19:13.500 --> 19:16.333
If that's what I'm feeling,

19:13.500 --> 19:16.333
it's not bad.

19:16.375 --> 19:19.125
Heh, you'll get

19:16.375 --> 19:19.125
used to it.

19:19.166 --> 19:22.917
So think maybe I've earned

19:19.166 --> 19:22.917
another chance here?

19:24.792 --> 19:25.917
Yeah.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.291
Yeah, I do.

19:25.959 --> 19:28.291
OPTIMUS: I agree.

19:28.333 --> 19:32.709
But I have other plans

19:28.333 --> 19:32.709
for both Blurr and Salvage.

19:32.750 --> 19:36.250
I have just learned

19:32.750 --> 19:36.250
what transpired.

19:36.291 --> 19:38.000
I am proud of you.

19:38.041 --> 19:39.458
Both of you.

19:39.500 --> 19:43.750
As I said, being a Rescue Bot

19:39.500 --> 19:43.750
is not a destiny,

19:43.792 --> 19:45.500
but a choice.

19:45.542 --> 19:47.750
I am glad

19:45.542 --> 19:47.750
you have made yours.

19:48.291 --> 19:50.291
( dramatic theme playing )

19:59.583 --> 20:02.166
Heatwave, you and your team

19:59.583 --> 20:02.166
have trained

20:02.208 --> 20:05.000
the new recruits well.

20:05.041 --> 20:07.875
Salvage and Blurr

20:05.041 --> 20:07.875
have proven themselves fit

20:07.917 --> 20:12.917
to serve as Rescue Bots

20:07.917 --> 20:12.917
at another Earth location.

20:12.959 --> 20:15.917
( all chatter )

20:15.959 --> 20:18.291
So, I guess

20:15.959 --> 20:18.291
this is goodbye?

20:18.333 --> 20:20.917
You two noobs

20:18.333 --> 20:20.917
don't get off that easily.

20:20.959 --> 20:22.709
I'll be checking in on you

20:20.959 --> 20:22.709
for some long distance

20:22.750 --> 20:25.041
supplemental training.

20:22.750 --> 20:25.041
Wow.

20:25.083 --> 20:27.125
Something must be wrong

20:25.083 --> 20:27.125
with me.

20:27.166 --> 20:30.166
Because, uh, I'm actually

20:27.166 --> 20:30.166
looking forward to that.

20:31.542 --> 20:32.834
( machine beeps )

20:32.875 --> 20:34.375
Good news, Chief.

20:34.417 --> 20:37.125
The effects of the CME

20:34.417 --> 20:37.125
have completely abated.

20:37.166 --> 20:41.625
The power station

20:37.166 --> 20:41.625
is about to come back online.

20:41.667 --> 20:43.458
We were just getting used

20:41.667 --> 20:43.458
to having you here.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.583
We go where we're needed, kid.

20:43.500 --> 20:46.583
We're Rescue Bots.

20:48.125 --> 20:49.750
And, Cody,

20:49.792 --> 20:51.250
thanks for helping me

20:49.792 --> 20:51.250
earn this.
