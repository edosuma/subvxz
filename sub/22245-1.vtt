00:52.983 --> 00:56.073
<i>When we last spoke, you called me a coward.</i>

00:56.153 --> 00:59.489
<i>Now I do not see the Lord's way
as a violent one...</i>

01:00.122 --> 01:02.278
<i>...but I did pray for you.</i>

01:02.358 --> 01:04.947
<i>I prayed that you would survive the war...</i>

01:05.027 --> 01:07.251
<i>...in the stand for righteousness.</i>

01:07.631 --> 01:09.852
<i>I write you now for your help.</i>

01:09.932 --> 01:14.591
<i>I see how action must sometimes
be taken to right terrible wrongs.</i>

01:15.372 --> 01:19.821
<i>There are bad men here
terrorizing this good community.</i>

01:20.309 --> 01:24.312
<i>I have taken a stand
and have paid a price for it.</i>

01:25.515 --> 01:26.748
Reverend McCord?

01:27.617 --> 01:30.169
Miss Ginny. May I help you?

01:30.249 --> 01:32.321
I need to talk.

01:36.359 --> 01:39.982
Well, it is rather late.

01:40.362 --> 01:42.799
And I fear it may not be very proper.

01:43.632 --> 01:45.722
I want to quit this life.

01:46.182 --> 01:48.003
I'm ashamed of who I am.

01:49.371 --> 01:51.108
Of what I've become.

01:51.188 --> 01:55.724
Miss Ginny, God forgives us
our sins when we recognize them.

01:55.804 --> 01:59.985
That sounds good and all, but how?
How am I gonna get away from Reb?

02:01.684 --> 02:03.885
He says he owns me.

02:05.256 --> 02:07.611
He'll never let me go.

02:07.857 --> 02:12.127
Miss Ginny, if you give yourself over to
the Lord, and he will take care of you.

02:12.796 --> 02:14.997
And I will stand with you.

02:21.604 --> 02:23.838
I want to believe you, Thomas.

02:24.975 --> 02:26.810
You just have faith.

02:36.085 --> 02:38.627
Miss... Miss Ginny, please. Please stop.

02:39.387 --> 02:42.592
- Okay.
- We can talk more in the morning.

02:43.392 --> 02:45.584
But you get yourself on home safe now.

02:57.123 --> 02:58.947
Well, ain't this a sight?

03:00.077 --> 03:03.946
Reb, it's nothing. We was just...
we was just talking is all.

03:04.026 --> 03:07.066
Miss Ginny came for spiritual guidance.

03:08.168 --> 03:10.002
That's what you call it?

03:10.754 --> 03:12.822
Nothing happened, Reb.

03:14.790 --> 03:17.259
This here is a house of God...

03:18.261 --> 03:20.330
...and I will you kindly ask you to leave.

03:22.665 --> 03:24.354
- Ah!
- Reb, stop it.

03:24.434 --> 03:26.389
- Get on home, Ginny.
- Baby, please, don't...

03:26.469 --> 03:28.003
Get!

03:34.944 --> 03:37.366
You done mess up, Preacher.

03:42.686 --> 03:44.887
Nothing happened, Reb.

03:47.656 --> 03:49.524
That one's from me.

03:51.995 --> 03:53.763
And that one's from the mayor.

03:54.764 --> 03:56.435
The mayor?

03:56.515 --> 03:59.488
I believe you were told to keep your
goddamn nose out of his business.

04:01.070 --> 04:05.473
You should play along. But no,
you got to be all high-and-mighty.

04:11.748 --> 04:15.504
Yea, though I walk through
the valley of the shadow of death...

04:15.584 --> 04:17.642
...I will fear no evil...

04:17.721 --> 04:19.708
...for thou art with me...

04:19.788 --> 04:23.258
...thy rod and thy staff shall comfort me.

04:30.168 --> 04:32.435
See you on the other side, Reverend.

08:59.122 --> 09:00.940
Help me!

09:02.337 --> 09:05.187
- Help me!
- Strap him up.

09:10.680 --> 09:12.482
Help me!

09:16.587 --> 09:18.855
What is this man's crime?

09:21.658 --> 09:23.680
Well, can't you see for yourself?

09:23.760 --> 09:25.761
Crime of niggerdom.

09:26.924 --> 09:29.999
Ain't you heard? War's over.

09:30.900 --> 09:32.456
You lost.

09:32.536 --> 09:34.607
The war's over when I say it's over.

09:34.687 --> 09:37.393
My counsel to you is that you
get back on that horse of yours...

09:37.473 --> 09:40.154
...before I strap you to this here pole.

09:45.049 --> 09:46.883
Untie the nigger.

09:50.202 --> 09:53.309
- What's your name, son?
- Abraham, sir.

09:53.389 --> 09:56.592
- You go on home, Abraham.
- Thank you, sir.

09:59.029 --> 10:01.263
My name is James McCord...

10:02.064 --> 10:04.465
...but my friends call me "Marshal."

10:05.836 --> 10:07.557
We gonna have a problem?

10:08.037 --> 10:11.073
No, Marshal. No problem.

10:41.038 --> 10:42.572
Whiskey.

10:50.346 --> 10:52.570
Ah. One more.

10:52.650 --> 10:54.331
Nice hat.

10:54.651 --> 10:56.518
Thank you.

10:58.889 --> 11:00.756
I want it.

11:01.357 --> 11:03.193
Excuse me?

11:03.859 --> 11:06.530
I said that I want it.

11:06.610 --> 11:09.085
I'm sure you can get one for yourself.

11:09.165 --> 11:11.187
I want that one.

11:11.267 --> 11:13.301
Not gonna happen.

11:18.407 --> 11:21.117
Unless you wanna die for this hat,
I suggest you pick up your friend...

11:21.197 --> 11:23.389
...and leave me to my drink.

11:44.233 --> 11:46.868
Anyone here tell me where the church is?

11:52.359 --> 11:54.160
No one?

11:54.778 --> 11:57.197
No one knows where the church is.

11:59.849 --> 12:02.901
Head back down the road to the edge of town.

12:03.386 --> 12:06.326
You won't find much, but you can't miss it.

12:07.891 --> 12:10.513
If any of y'all see the Reverend McCord...

12:10.593 --> 12:13.046
...you tell him his brother's
looking for him.

12:22.172 --> 12:24.194
<i>It's a tragic thing.</i>

12:24.774 --> 12:27.493
Man of the cloth burning to death like that.

12:28.277 --> 12:31.218
- He had plenty of chances.
- Yeah.

12:31.298 --> 12:33.516
Well, accidents happen.

12:33.884 --> 12:37.170
You know, when I first come out here...

12:37.787 --> 12:40.673
...there was open space far as you could see.

12:41.824 --> 12:44.026
Wild country for the taking.

12:44.862 --> 12:48.141
Some folks call it "God's country." Well...

12:48.616 --> 12:50.505
...well, I say...

12:50.585 --> 12:54.754
...not even God's gonna stop me
from taking my share.

12:57.373 --> 12:59.892
What about blood?

13:02.012 --> 13:06.098
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Preacher's brother rode into town.

13:06.783 --> 13:09.802
- Really?
- I've seen his type before.

13:10.253 --> 13:12.538
A dog looking for a bone.

13:12.955 --> 13:15.073
And he's a marshal.

13:16.826 --> 13:18.877
He's a U.S. Marshal.

13:21.965 --> 13:23.783
You saying that...

13:24.567 --> 13:29.026
...he might not buy the fact
that his brother's death was...

13:29.106 --> 13:30.864
...accidental?

13:34.110 --> 13:35.994
It could be that...

13:38.282 --> 13:40.734
...accidents run in the family.

13:42.552 --> 13:44.637
Yeah, I reckon they may.

13:46.855 --> 13:50.621
Hey, why don't you get yourself a Colt?
You know they're more reliable?

13:53.129 --> 13:57.216
My daddy give me this gun. It suits me fine.

13:58.901 --> 14:01.586
Why don't you worry about that U.S. Marshal?

14:06.180 --> 14:11.034
"...because he maketh intercession
for the saints according to the will of God.

14:11.614 --> 14:16.373
And we know that all things work together
for good to them that love God...

14:16.453 --> 14:20.277
...to them who are the called
according to his purpose.

14:20.357 --> 14:23.480
For whom he did foreknow,
he also did predestinate...

14:23.560 --> 14:26.382
...to be conformed to the image of his son...

14:26.462 --> 14:29.486
...that he might be the firstborn
among many brethren."

14:29.566 --> 14:31.058
Whoa.

14:40.410 --> 14:42.228
How can I help you, sir?

14:43.012 --> 14:45.430
This is my brother's church.

14:45.849 --> 14:47.467
I'm looking for him.

14:50.020 --> 14:53.673
That'll be all for today, children.
Thank you, ladies.

14:55.759 --> 14:57.610
I'm Melissa.

14:59.296 --> 15:01.347
James McCord.

15:02.932 --> 15:04.817
Let me take you to him.

15:17.282 --> 15:19.819
I'm so sorry, little brother.

15:19.899 --> 15:22.133
I should have come sooner.

15:23.486 --> 15:25.007
You didn't know?

15:25.087 --> 15:28.173
Did I ask you where
my dead brother was buried?

15:30.860 --> 15:32.941
I'm sorry. I...

15:34.563 --> 15:36.415
It's not your fault.

15:49.079 --> 15:50.901
"Dear James...

15:51.281 --> 15:54.101
...when we last spoke,
you called me a coward.

15:59.022 --> 16:02.240
I do not see the Lord's way
as a violent one...

16:04.561 --> 16:06.551
...but I did pray for you."

16:06.631 --> 16:11.187
<i>I prayed that you would survive
the war in the stand for righteousness.</i>

16:11.267 --> 16:13.790
<i>I write you now for your help.</i>

16:13.870 --> 16:17.924
<i>I see how action must sometimes
be taken to right terrible wrongs.</i>

16:22.246 --> 16:26.732
<i>There are bad men here
terrorizing this good community.</i>

16:28.118 --> 16:31.141
<i>I have taken a stand
and have paid a price for it.</i>

16:31.221 --> 16:33.039
"I fear for my life.

16:33.723 --> 16:36.045
I beseech you, come quickly.

16:36.125 --> 16:38.047
Help drive this evil away.

16:38.127 --> 16:39.978
Your brother, Thomas."

16:46.169 --> 16:48.054
Are you a sheriff?

16:50.172 --> 16:52.057
U.S. Marshal.

16:58.315 --> 17:00.533
Do you know how my brother died?

17:03.220 --> 17:06.306
They found his body
in the church after it burned.

17:09.758 --> 17:13.880
There are bad men in this town,
and he did stand up against them.

17:14.430 --> 17:16.488
<i>Does the Word not say...</i>

17:17.468 --> 17:21.954
...that the righteous and the meek
shall inherit the earth?

17:23.172 --> 17:24.894
But tell me this.

17:24.973 --> 17:27.858
When is it time to just pray?

17:28.413 --> 17:32.432
Yes, the good book tells us, and I quote...

17:33.282 --> 17:35.634
"...Must not we look the other way?"

17:37.704 --> 17:41.279
But it also tells us that there is a time...

17:41.359 --> 17:43.448
...a time for everything.

17:44.128 --> 17:48.585
I am but one man, but I will not look away.

17:48.865 --> 17:52.853
I see who the thieves are,
and I call them out. There.

17:54.906 --> 18:00.214
There, my brothers and my sisters,
there are the servants of darkness.

18:10.520 --> 18:13.977
Stand with me, my brothers and my sisters.

18:14.657 --> 18:17.677
We can rid this town of their evil.

18:22.031 --> 18:24.650
I will find out what happened to my brother.

18:28.271 --> 18:31.157
If there was foul play,
someone will pay for it.

18:33.310 --> 18:35.144
Do you have a place to stay?

18:36.413 --> 18:38.468
Thought I'd camp out.

18:38.848 --> 18:41.339
We have a small bunkhouse out by our stables.

18:41.419 --> 18:44.879
It's not much to pride yourself on,
but you're welcome to stay there.

18:44.959 --> 18:48.390
- I don't want to impose, ma'am.
- No imposition, I assure you.

18:49.658 --> 18:51.882
Thank you very kindly.

18:51.962 --> 18:54.060
It's settled then.

19:31.201 --> 19:35.017
Hey! Hey, hey, you clumsy oaf.
Have a care there, will ya?

19:36.006 --> 19:37.790
Goddamn.

19:39.358 --> 19:41.377
Gus, open that up.

19:50.452 --> 19:54.074
- Uh-huh. Where are the guns?
- They're in the next shipment.

19:54.558 --> 19:57.409
All right. Close it up.

19:59.762 --> 20:02.181
You, get some canvas over that.

20:02.931 --> 20:05.184
Don't want them getting wet.

20:06.137 --> 20:08.251
Goddamn.

20:16.980 --> 20:21.572
Tom was always best with wits.
He, uh... he thought things through.

20:21.652 --> 20:24.371
I'm more of a take action kind of man.

20:24.451 --> 20:29.647
Well, we all appreciated how he
clarified the Good Lord's word...

20:29.727 --> 20:31.616
...for us simple folk.

20:31.696 --> 20:34.447
I wouldn't call you simple, ma'am.

20:35.064 --> 20:38.722
Thank you, kind sir.

20:39.002 --> 20:42.493
Melissa used to teach Bible lessons
to the children before Thomas arrived.

20:42.573 --> 20:44.909
She recites chapter and verse in her sleep.

20:44.989 --> 20:46.967
Stop it, Papa. You're embarrassing me.

20:47.047 --> 20:49.478
I saw it firsthand when I met her.

20:50.078 --> 20:52.595
Sometimes all people have is their faith.

20:53.115 --> 20:55.167
Thomas was always praying.

20:55.920 --> 20:59.576
Praying for something. I never understood it.

20:59.656 --> 21:03.478
If you want something,
just go get it. Why pray about it?

21:06.897 --> 21:08.919
How do you think Thomas died?

21:08.999 --> 21:13.275
We found his remains in the embers
at the church after the fire.

21:13.535 --> 21:16.424
I understand they found
his burned body, but...

21:17.104 --> 21:19.197
...why didn't he try to escape?

21:19.677 --> 21:22.806
They say he got drunk and
knocked over a lamp or something.

21:22.886 --> 21:24.931
And you believe that?

21:25.781 --> 21:27.488
No.

21:27.568 --> 21:29.173
Thomas wasn't a drinker.

21:29.253 --> 21:32.709
In fact, he'd always say good night
when the drinking got heavy.

21:32.789 --> 21:37.315
You mentioned that he thought Mayor Pierce
might be behind some of the trouble in town.

21:37.895 --> 21:40.685
You think he could've had something
to do with my brother's death?

21:40.765 --> 21:43.179
Yes. I do.

21:43.259 --> 21:45.150
Tell me.

21:47.236 --> 21:50.226
Men say before the war...

21:50.306 --> 21:52.964
...Pierce made his money as a slave trader.

21:53.044 --> 21:56.666
When the war started, many headed
east, but he stayed behind.

21:56.746 --> 21:59.504
Bought himself a position of power in town.

21:59.584 --> 22:03.507
He hired Reb and his band
of ex-Confederate soldiers as enforcers...

22:03.587 --> 22:06.209
...and bullied his way
into the mayor's office.

22:06.589 --> 22:09.079
How would he be able to get away
with something like that?

22:09.159 --> 22:11.177
Who could stop him?

22:11.929 --> 22:14.416
This is a small town, Marshal.

22:14.496 --> 22:17.730
Anyone with any influence he hired.

22:18.969 --> 22:23.023
When the war ended,
people came back and the town grew.

22:24.008 --> 22:26.663
Reb brought some
of his mercenaries to town...

22:26.743 --> 22:29.162
...and that's when things got real bad.

22:30.048 --> 22:35.009
Anyone who stood up to Reb or the mayor...

22:35.089 --> 22:36.611
...disappeared.

22:37.519 --> 22:39.877
Your brother wasn't the first.

22:40.157 --> 22:43.976
I don't buy for a minute that
he got drunk and tipped over a lamp.

22:44.595 --> 22:47.018
No, something happened to him.

22:47.098 --> 22:49.549
I'm not leaving till I figure out what.

22:55.905 --> 22:57.991
This was your brother's.

22:58.676 --> 23:01.545
After the fire, I found it in the embers.

23:10.320 --> 23:12.537
I remember this day.

23:14.424 --> 23:17.320
We hated standing still for so long.

23:25.901 --> 23:27.571
Our mother.

23:29.890 --> 23:31.707
Long time ago.

23:37.348 --> 23:39.203
Her wedding ring.

23:39.783 --> 23:42.443
She didn't want to be buried with it.
She wanted one of us to have it...

23:42.523 --> 23:44.563
...for when the time comes.

23:45.588 --> 23:47.439
It's beautiful.

23:56.867 --> 23:58.389
Journal.

23:59.069 --> 24:01.091
Did either of you know he kept this?

24:01.171 --> 24:03.655
No, I didn't.

24:04.188 --> 24:07.731
Well, it's getting late.
I think I'll be calling it an evening.

24:07.811 --> 24:09.400
- Good night, Daddy.
- Good night.

24:09.480 --> 24:11.564
Good night, James.

24:17.488 --> 24:19.339
Is she okay?

24:19.989 --> 24:21.845
It's been tough.

24:22.225 --> 24:24.648
Her husband was killed at Antietam.

24:25.128 --> 24:29.132
Shortly after, she lost her son,
my grandson, to diphtheria.

24:30.183 --> 24:31.665
Sorry to hear that.

24:31.745 --> 24:35.238
She's getting on though.
Little better every day.

24:41.344 --> 24:44.364
Let's see what you have
to tell me, little brother.

24:46.284 --> 24:49.646
<i>The West. A land full of promise for many.</i>

24:49.726 --> 24:53.006
<i>For me, it is the land of destiny.</i>

24:57.361 --> 25:00.318
<i>Though I left a good life
full of potential...</i>

25:00.398 --> 25:02.649
<i>...God's calling was stronger.</i>

25:03.666 --> 25:06.390
<i>I am convinced that the mayor
is behind all of this.</i>

25:06.470 --> 25:10.723
<i>Our community has been without any
form of law for more than a few years.</i>

25:11.175 --> 25:14.932
<i>Melissa Collins came by
just after the Reb incident.</i>

25:15.012 --> 25:16.830
<i>Such a lovely girl.</i>

25:18.081 --> 25:22.405
<i>I followed the mayor to an abandoned
mine filled with weapons.</i>

25:22.485 --> 25:24.703
<i>I drew a map to the location.</i>

25:48.278 --> 25:52.003
Reb ain't gonna wanna hear that you
ain't got the money today, boy.

25:52.083 --> 25:53.460
Like I said, sir...

25:53.540 --> 25:55.341
- ...things have been slow lately.
- Mm-hmm.

25:55.421 --> 25:59.475
A couple army officers asked if I could
tend to their horses next week...

25:59.555 --> 26:01.644
...and maybe fix a few things.

26:02.024 --> 26:04.882
That ain't gonna solve the problem
we have here today now, is it?

26:04.962 --> 26:07.351
Put the gun down. Tell me what's going on.

26:07.431 --> 26:11.283
Business. It ain't none of yours.

26:11.902 --> 26:13.719
Making it mine.

26:15.071 --> 26:19.363
We know who you are.
You better learn yourself who we are.

26:19.443 --> 26:22.682
- You gonna pay these men when you can?
- Yes, sir.

26:23.680 --> 26:25.535
Well, there you have it.

26:26.115 --> 26:28.568
That's all you'll get today. Get out of here.

26:29.920 --> 26:32.338
Son of a bitch.

26:40.264 --> 26:43.578
Thank you. How can I repay you?

26:43.668 --> 26:46.146
If you can take a look at my horse.
We've been on the trail a long time.

26:46.226 --> 26:49.721
- Might need some tending to.
- You saved my son, Abraham.

26:50.406 --> 26:53.294
Anything you need, it's on me.

26:57.884 --> 26:59.970
Man should be paid for his work.

27:00.050 --> 27:01.868
Thank you.

27:04.189 --> 27:08.511
You know your taxes have to be paid,
or there will be consequences.

27:08.591 --> 27:10.351
How am I supposed to feed my family?

27:10.431 --> 27:13.471
That's a problem you need to figure out.

27:14.898 --> 27:16.488
Please.

27:19.068 --> 27:22.760
That's enough, boys. Let's not do this again.

27:22.840 --> 27:25.525
Just put it down. Gently.

27:26.176 --> 27:28.027
And back away.

27:32.883 --> 27:36.574
This ain't over. You can't just be
coming in someone else's town...

27:36.654 --> 27:38.625
...acting like you own the place.

27:38.705 --> 27:41.296
Well, that's ironic, ain't it?

27:41.426 --> 27:46.047
So why don't you and your...
partner clear on out of here.

27:55.004 --> 27:57.223
You're a blessing from heaven.

27:59.843 --> 28:02.041
Don't be so sure about that.

28:10.020 --> 28:13.039
Hey, cowboy. Want to have a good time?

28:13.907 --> 28:15.974
No, thank you, ma'am.

28:22.733 --> 28:24.250
Whiskey.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.916
Give me two more.

28:47.857 --> 28:49.182
Thank you.

28:53.465 --> 28:55.282
Mind if I join you?

28:57.367 --> 28:58.951
Thanks.

29:00.520 --> 29:03.745
- Wanted to introduce myself.
- No need, Marshal.

29:04.275 --> 29:06.527
Yeah, I guess I'm not surprised.

29:07.345 --> 29:10.701
- Listen, Captain, I may need your help.
- I don't see how that's possible.

29:10.781 --> 29:14.772
It's our mission to keep this country safe.
Yours is to keep the peace.

29:14.852 --> 29:18.104
You and I both know
it's not always that cut-and-dried.

29:20.223 --> 29:22.412
Where were you stationed?

29:22.492 --> 29:25.543
Gettysburg. 20th Maine.

29:25.896 --> 29:30.341
War could've been lost if you boys hadn't
held back the Confederates like you did.

29:31.802 --> 29:35.273
North and South. You can say
it was that simple, but...

29:36.607 --> 29:39.897
...it was just a bunch of kids
killing each other... Americans.

29:39.977 --> 29:42.100
You boys at Gettysburg too?

29:42.180 --> 29:45.768
Second Bull Run, Antietam, Fredericksburg.

29:45.848 --> 29:48.935
- Here's to them all.
- Amen.

29:52.056 --> 29:54.581
What's this about? Got something
to do with your brother, I assume.

29:54.661 --> 29:58.499
I ain't got nothing solid yet, but...

29:58.972 --> 30:01.980
...he was fixing to bring
some things to light in this town.

30:02.599 --> 30:05.756
We have eyes on the mayor
for our own reasons.

30:05.836 --> 30:09.926
However, those reasons
do not include family disputes.

30:10.406 --> 30:13.463
But seeing as how we're dealing
with enemies of the state...

30:13.543 --> 30:17.616
...Quantrill's Raiders and all, might be
able to do a little something for you.

30:19.316 --> 30:22.178
Do not come to me without hard evidence.

30:22.753 --> 30:26.839
I cannot jeopardize our mission just to
help you with your revenge, you understand?

30:27.524 --> 30:29.096
Yes, sir, I do.

30:36.533 --> 30:38.418
Excuse me, Mayor.

30:40.555 --> 30:42.840
That reverend's brother is a problem.

30:48.679 --> 30:50.568
Which means what?

30:51.148 --> 30:54.572
He kept us from collecting rent
from the blacksmith...

30:55.302 --> 30:57.837
...and from the Trumble store today.

30:59.025 --> 31:04.451
Lord, why have you seen fit to surround me
with a pack of imbeciles and morons?

31:04.763 --> 31:09.086
Well, you told us not to use
our guns and draw on folks...

31:09.166 --> 31:12.306
...so what are we supposed to do?

31:12.970 --> 31:15.054
Well, now I'm telling you...

31:15.806 --> 31:19.047
...get off my porch. Get out of my sight!

31:19.477 --> 31:21.361
Go on.

31:31.289 --> 31:36.307
This McCord character, he can't be
allowed to interfere with my business.

31:36.893 --> 31:38.710
He's like a...

31:40.130 --> 31:43.086
...disease. Could be contagious.

31:43.166 --> 31:45.018
Gonna have to be dealt with.

31:46.202 --> 31:48.090
So what you wanna do about it?

31:48.670 --> 31:50.255
Well...

31:51.075 --> 31:54.261
...put some men on him. Not those two idiots.

31:55.012 --> 31:57.063
Pick two other idiots.

31:57.648 --> 31:59.876
See what he's up to.

31:59.956 --> 32:01.810
I'll handle it.

32:02.401 --> 32:06.483
I've fed you all. Don't act like
you didn't get any. Shoo now.

32:08.025 --> 32:09.547
Oh.

32:09.627 --> 32:12.329
Morning. I didn't see you standing there.

32:12.409 --> 32:17.454
The morning sun in your hair glows.
Looks kind of like a halo.

32:18.534 --> 32:21.625
Well, I'm no angel, that's for sure.

32:21.705 --> 32:23.792
That ain't the word around town.

32:26.375 --> 32:28.566
Listen, I found some things
in Thomas's journal.

32:28.646 --> 32:32.502
- Might prove the mayor is up to no good.
- What did you find?

32:32.582 --> 32:35.538
This map. Points to a cache.

32:35.618 --> 32:38.703
The journal says it's full
of stolen weapons and money.

32:40.390 --> 32:44.114
I don't know how to read this.
I don't recognize any of the terrain.

32:44.194 --> 32:47.917
When Tom and I were kids,
we used to play Indian scout.

32:47.997 --> 32:51.589
We'd draw these maps
to help settlers get out west.

32:51.669 --> 32:54.158
We drew them in code
so if they were ever stolen...

32:54.238 --> 32:55.974
...bad guys wouldn't know how to use them.

32:56.054 --> 32:58.311
See, the symbol for North.

32:58.641 --> 33:01.534
That's a pond and some trees.

33:02.511 --> 33:06.517
Point is, I can use that map
to find the mayor's supply cache.

33:06.951 --> 33:08.256
I'll go with you.

33:08.336 --> 33:10.971
No, there's no telling
what I'll find up there.

33:12.656 --> 33:14.643
If something happens to me...

33:14.723 --> 33:19.017
...I need you to find Captain Lewis
and give him that translated map.

33:19.197 --> 33:22.156
His base is just outside of town.
Only Captain Lewis.

33:23.166 --> 33:26.823
I know where this is. It's an old
abandoned mine. I can take you there.

33:26.903 --> 33:28.788
No, I need you here.

33:29.506 --> 33:30.907
Okay.

33:31.742 --> 33:33.594
Only Captain Lewis now.

35:16.680 --> 35:19.899
Someone shot out the lock.
Let's check it out.

36:19.609 --> 36:22.233
- Well, can you read?
- Yes, sir.

36:22.313 --> 36:24.164
Then read it to me.

36:28.519 --> 36:31.408
"Mayor Pierce, our armory
at Sawtooth is heavy...

36:31.488 --> 36:36.027
...and we have recruited over 400 men
thus far ready to do what is necessary.

36:36.107 --> 36:39.650
In addition, we have recruited 200
soldiers from Virginia and Kentucky...

36:39.730 --> 36:41.866
...ready to come
and fight for your territory.

36:41.946 --> 36:45.422
Please confirm that you have
prepared ample accommodations.

36:45.502 --> 36:48.125
Sincerely, Mayor J.W. Cooter."

36:48.205 --> 36:50.055
Damn, son.

36:50.908 --> 36:52.759
You read good.

36:55.278 --> 36:58.365
And you are the bearer of glad tidings.

36:59.350 --> 37:01.772
I want you to bring Mayor Cooter
a message from me.

37:01.852 --> 37:05.275
I want you to say to him, you see...

37:05.355 --> 37:09.375
"...J.W., thank you for this inspiring..."

37:11.128 --> 37:14.614
Yeah, that's all right.
Don't knock. Just walk right in.

37:15.403 --> 37:17.601
- You got something to say?
- Yeah.

37:17.681 --> 37:20.285
Son, step outside. Close the door.

37:22.440 --> 37:25.724
Yeah, yeah, just... just have a seat.

37:27.444 --> 37:31.469
The boys saw the preacher's brother
ride out of town today.

37:31.549 --> 37:33.571
Word is he was heading North.

37:33.651 --> 37:36.036
Out of town as in "for good"?

37:36.787 --> 37:39.914
- It's hard to say.
- Did they follow him?

37:39.994 --> 37:43.459
Nope. Don't know where he went.

37:44.829 --> 37:48.753
I would call that completely
useless information, wouldn't you?

37:48.833 --> 37:52.686
By the time they got word to me,
the marshal was long gone.

37:53.537 --> 37:57.961
I thought it'd be best for them
to sit tight, wait for his return.

37:58.041 --> 37:59.726
That's what you thought?

37:59.806 --> 38:03.435
Reb, I want you to listen to me.

38:03.515 --> 38:05.316
You see...

38:07.317 --> 38:09.374
...you're not educated.

38:09.754 --> 38:14.446
You're not an intelligent man.
In fact, you're stupid.

38:14.526 --> 38:16.247
You are a stupid man.

38:18.061 --> 38:20.519
You are a hired thug who shoots people.

38:21.199 --> 38:24.655
You cannot offer me anything I cannot
buy one hundred times over.

38:24.735 --> 38:26.307
You understand?

38:28.738 --> 38:30.757
Yeah, I hear ya.

38:35.913 --> 38:37.615
Therefore...

38:38.215 --> 38:42.702
...I do not want to know
what you think about anything ever.

38:43.787 --> 38:47.077
I pay you to do what I think...

38:47.157 --> 38:51.012
...and right now I think you're
forgetting who's running this show.

38:52.481 --> 38:54.915
See, this ain't your town, son.

38:56.467 --> 38:58.488
This town belongs to me.

38:58.568 --> 39:02.030
I'm the mayor. And that's just the start.

39:02.773 --> 39:06.831
So don't you dare presume
to bite the hand that feeds you...

39:06.911 --> 39:10.397
...lest you find yourself
dying of starvation.

39:12.015 --> 39:13.532
Savvy?

39:20.124 --> 39:23.317
Sorry. Won't happen again.

39:30.601 --> 39:33.046
Hey, let's say that that...

39:33.507 --> 39:36.128
...marshal does come back, huh?

39:36.773 --> 39:38.897
I want you to have a chat with him.

39:38.977 --> 39:43.374
I want you to persuade him that it's
time for him to leave this town forever.

39:43.454 --> 39:45.542
Yeah, what if he won't be persuaded?

39:45.622 --> 39:49.318
Well, then he's gonna have an accident.

39:50.704 --> 39:54.494
Now, let's not forget, he is a U.S.
Marshal. I don't want an investigation.

39:54.574 --> 39:59.829
So when I say "accident,"
Reb, I mean "accident."

40:06.654 --> 40:08.438
That's all.

40:11.192 --> 40:13.008
Hey, Reb.

40:14.154 --> 40:17.248
Ask that bright young fella
to step back in here, will ya?

40:27.676 --> 40:29.560
I'm so glad you're safe.

40:34.415 --> 40:36.663
Um, well, I found it.

40:37.584 --> 40:41.675
It's all true. There's enough guns
and TNT over there to start a war.

40:41.775 --> 40:43.576
Do you think the captain will help us?

40:43.656 --> 40:45.291
Let's hope so.

41:16.356 --> 41:18.876
You're gonna give me a goddamn headache.

41:20.160 --> 41:23.049
One of you imbeciles spit out
what you's trying to spit.

41:23.129 --> 41:25.986
- You go.
- Someone found the mine, boss.

41:26.066 --> 41:28.119
Three of ours got taken out.

41:34.674 --> 41:36.525
Enough's enough.

41:57.780 --> 41:59.719
- Whoa, whoa.
- Get the horse some water.

41:59.799 --> 42:01.617
Yes, sir.

42:02.436 --> 42:04.425
What brings you out here, McCord?

42:04.505 --> 42:06.328
I followed a map my brother drew.

42:06.408 --> 42:10.305
Leads to an abandoned mine
that's full of rifles, powder kegs...

42:10.387 --> 42:12.241
...stolen gold.

42:14.048 --> 42:17.429
- He's planning something big, Captain.
- How many rifles?

42:18.019 --> 42:20.301
Fifty, maybe 60 crates.

42:20.381 --> 42:24.112
You know why the army
sent me here to this hellhole?

42:24.192 --> 42:27.448
This area's not entirely under the jurisdiction
of the United States government...

42:27.528 --> 42:29.718
...and there are concerns in Washington.

42:29.798 --> 42:32.819
We have information that there are
rogue elements from the Confederacy...

42:32.899 --> 42:36.089
...that's not willing to accept Mr. Lincoln
and his Emancipation Proclamation.

42:36.169 --> 42:38.738
That would explain the influx
of ex-Confederates in the area.

42:38.818 --> 42:41.632
Precisely. For these men, the war isn't over.

42:41.712 --> 42:43.364
We'll investigate the mine...

42:43.444 --> 42:46.873
...and we'll commandeer anything
we feel is connected to this uprising.

42:46.953 --> 42:50.104
But I cannot point blame at Mayor Pierce
unless you have proof of his connection...

42:50.184 --> 42:52.202
...to this alleged arsenal.

43:05.784 --> 43:07.585
Hey, McCord.

43:10.636 --> 43:14.198
- What do you want?
- I got some information about your brother.

43:15.460 --> 43:18.699
- Don't waste my time, Ginny.
- Oh. You know me now, do you?

43:18.779 --> 43:20.869
You're Reb's whore. What information?

43:20.949 --> 43:22.969
Not out here in the open.

43:23.349 --> 43:26.549
They might see us. Over here.

43:32.159 --> 43:35.188
- I don't have all night.
- I just need a few minutes.

43:35.268 --> 43:36.846
Ginny.

43:37.680 --> 43:40.164
Do you have information for me or not?

43:42.704 --> 43:44.503
Here it comes now.

43:49.142 --> 43:50.994
Sorry, James.

43:56.751 --> 44:00.603
I would love to shoot you
in your goddamn face right now.

44:01.754 --> 44:04.201
But the boss says to give you
one more chance to...

44:04.281 --> 44:06.928
...go back to wherever you came from
and forget about this place.

44:07.008 --> 44:10.507
- That's not gonna happen.
- I was hoping you'd say that.

44:10.987 --> 44:12.816
Cover him, boys.

44:23.242 --> 44:26.149
You're gonna leave this town,
on the horse or in a maple box...

44:26.229 --> 44:29.317
...it makes no nevermind to me. Pick him up.

44:47.101 --> 44:48.756
How's that?

44:48.836 --> 44:51.225
You getting the message yet, Marshal?

44:51.305 --> 44:53.949
What's up there, Yankee?
Can't hear you. Spit it out.

44:54.307 --> 44:56.165
What you saying?

44:56.245 --> 44:58.116
You smell like horse shit.

45:04.483 --> 45:07.570
All right, that's enough.
Tough son of a bitch.

45:08.657 --> 45:10.474
Let's go, boys.

45:39.621 --> 45:41.505
Come on, boy.

45:42.323 --> 45:44.208
Take me home.

46:03.745 --> 46:05.557
Hey there, Marshal.

46:05.962 --> 46:07.834
You're safe now.

46:09.384 --> 46:12.002
Relax. You need your rest.

46:17.292 --> 46:20.143
<i>Yeah, I'm sure he was
breathing when we left him.</i>

46:22.463 --> 46:25.568
Well, let's hope it inspires his departure.

46:26.098 --> 46:29.858
He'll be down a spell.
Give us some time to focus on business.

46:29.938 --> 46:31.358
No, no.

46:31.438 --> 46:34.162
Let's let the dust settle for a day or so.

46:34.242 --> 46:36.464
Give the townsfolk time to...

46:36.544 --> 46:40.764
...digest and reflect on what happens
to heroes in my town.

46:41.316 --> 46:45.210
I'm going to bed.
Shut the door on your way out.

47:20.221 --> 47:21.866
Thank you.

47:22.689 --> 47:24.574
Of course.

47:49.515 --> 47:52.035
I don't want you to end up like Thomas.

47:54.254 --> 47:56.409
Thomas and I were always very different.

47:58.992 --> 48:01.845
As a U.S. Marshal, all I knew was death...

48:02.562 --> 48:04.614
...thieves and killers.

48:06.033 --> 48:07.884
Then the war broke out.

48:09.771 --> 48:13.423
In a land torn apart by hatred,
he preached love.

48:16.044 --> 48:19.897
While men were getting beaten
and hanged, he preached forgiveness.

48:21.950 --> 48:25.602
When the world was at its cruelest,
he preached compassion.

48:27.055 --> 48:28.939
That ain't me.

48:29.691 --> 48:31.908
There's no forgiveness here.

48:34.662 --> 48:36.914
Thomas was a good man.

48:39.032 --> 48:42.970
Guess what I'm trying to say is I'm not
gonna end up like him because I am not...

48:43.050 --> 48:44.888
...like him.

48:51.511 --> 48:53.802
Do you want to try and stand up?

48:54.682 --> 48:56.699
Take a few steps?

49:00.755 --> 49:02.832
- Use me, all right?
- Yeah.

49:03.657 --> 49:06.125
Take your time. Go slow.

49:09.897 --> 49:11.748
Go slow.

49:20.240 --> 49:22.124
There you go.

49:28.049 --> 49:29.932
You all right?

49:31.551 --> 49:35.004
And who knows what David
used to bring the giant down?

49:35.088 --> 49:37.485
- April.
- A rock.

49:37.565 --> 49:40.362
That's right. You are so smart.

50:07.621 --> 50:09.873
You're blocking my light.

50:11.592 --> 50:15.016
Hey, Reb, you are familiar with this book...

50:15.096 --> 50:19.351
<i>...Democracy in America</i>
by Alexis de Tocqueville?

50:20.167 --> 50:21.789
Can't say I am.

50:21.869 --> 50:25.360
Oh. Well, it's damn fascinating.
I mean, this man, a Frenchman...

50:25.440 --> 50:29.930
...he, uh, well, he traveled all across
this country after the revolution.

50:30.010 --> 50:33.564
He wrote just the most
marvelous words about America.

50:33.644 --> 50:37.004
- You don't say.
- I don't say what?

50:37.084 --> 50:41.192
That a Frenchman traveled the country
and wrote good stuff about America and all.

50:41.272 --> 50:43.110
No, I did say that.

50:43.190 --> 50:45.613
Never mind. I got news.

50:45.693 --> 50:48.866
There was a shoot-out at the old mine.
A few of my boys got cut down.

50:48.946 --> 50:50.418
- Really?
- Yeah.

50:50.498 --> 50:53.720
My condolences. Who did it?

50:53.800 --> 50:56.499
- Can't say for sure.
- Let me rephrase that.

50:56.579 --> 50:59.186
Do you think that the marshal did it?

50:59.887 --> 51:02.893
- I can't say.
- You just said that.

51:03.412 --> 51:06.835
- Anything missing?
- Don't look like anything's missing.

51:06.915 --> 51:09.641
You know, you are head of security
for me, and I got to tell you...

51:09.721 --> 51:12.935
...I'm not feeling all
that damn secure these days.

51:13.388 --> 51:17.632
If the marshal is behind this, it puts us
in a damned unfortunate situation.

51:17.712 --> 51:20.677
With my hands tied,
there is only so much that I can do.

51:20.757 --> 51:24.213
Well, for once you're right. Yeah.

51:38.179 --> 51:39.764
Yeah.

51:46.654 --> 51:49.096
This town cannot afford...

51:49.176 --> 51:52.314
...to have another martyr,
particularly not a U.S. Marshal.

51:52.394 --> 51:54.212
Raise your right hand.

51:56.129 --> 51:57.958
Now, do you...

51:58.315 --> 52:03.107
...solemnly swear to uphold the
rightful duties of sheriff of our town?

52:03.187 --> 52:06.533
- Definitely not.
- Just say "Yes, I do."

52:06.873 --> 52:09.263
- You're shitting me.
- Say yes or you're fired.

52:09.543 --> 52:14.669
Fine. I do. But this here is just
temporary. I got a reputation.

52:14.749 --> 52:16.656
Congratulations, Sheriff.

52:17.952 --> 52:22.539
I think you might want to deputize
a few of your, uh, colleagues.

52:23.260 --> 52:25.312
If you do harbor...

52:25.392 --> 52:28.583
...dreams of becoming
the next head of security...

52:28.663 --> 52:33.284
...for the first president
of the Western Republic...

52:34.335 --> 52:37.609
...you will deal with this
marshal situation pronto.

52:37.689 --> 52:39.557
Will do.

52:41.242 --> 52:43.208
Counting on you.

52:50.018 --> 52:52.264
<i>I'd been a U.S. Marshal for a couple years.</i>

52:52.754 --> 52:55.108
I was up in Massachusetts, so...

52:55.188 --> 52:59.042
...I joined up with the 12th Mass,
marched off to fight evil.

52:59.659 --> 53:01.792
He chose to head out west.

53:01.882 --> 53:03.755
Preach the word.

53:04.866 --> 53:07.285
His version of fighting evil, I reckon.

53:08.668 --> 53:11.288
But at the time, I thought it was cowardice.

53:11.839 --> 53:14.628
Running away from the hard work of...

53:14.708 --> 53:16.932
...putting the country back together...

53:17.012 --> 53:19.169
...putting an end to slavery.

53:20.281 --> 53:21.799
Oh.

53:22.783 --> 53:24.600
Got a splinter.

53:25.654 --> 53:27.505
May I?

53:45.205 --> 53:47.089
Found it.

53:55.883 --> 53:57.252
All better?

53:57.984 --> 53:59.535
Yeah.

54:04.809 --> 54:06.361
What is it?

54:06.441 --> 54:08.476
When I was, uh...

54:08.808 --> 54:12.450
...reading Thomas's journal,
I came across some passages...

54:12.880 --> 54:14.751
...about you.

54:15.270 --> 54:17.355
I thought there might be.

54:18.939 --> 54:20.924
What would you like to know?

54:21.676 --> 54:23.289
Were you...

54:23.369 --> 54:26.467
...close, the two of you?

54:26.647 --> 54:28.532
Why do you ask, Marshal?

54:30.152 --> 54:32.005
Are you warm on me?

54:32.885 --> 54:34.736
Get behind me.

54:35.755 --> 54:37.470
Please give me a reason.

54:38.760 --> 54:40.644
What do you want?

54:46.877 --> 54:50.528
Sorry to break up your little moment.
There was a moment, right?

54:50.608 --> 54:52.387
But you are under arrest...

54:52.467 --> 54:55.526
...for the attempted rape
of one Miss Ginny Post.

54:55.977 --> 54:58.693
- What are you up to now, Reb?
- The other night we stopped...

54:58.773 --> 55:01.996
...your man here from having his way
with a respected maiden of this community.

55:02.076 --> 55:04.074
There is no way.

55:04.154 --> 55:06.469
Melissa, are you suggesting that because...

55:06.549 --> 55:10.544
...Miss Ginny used to be a prostitute,
that that makes it okay?

55:10.624 --> 55:13.335
She never said that, and I didn't touch her.

55:13.415 --> 55:15.850
Way she tells it, you roughed her up a bit.

55:15.930 --> 55:19.910
You did all sorts of things to her
that even my delicate ears can't handle.

55:20.800 --> 55:22.789
Come to think on it...

55:22.869 --> 55:26.757
...your brother, the scum sucker
that he was, he tried the same thing.

55:27.712 --> 55:29.727
Runs in the family, I guess.

55:30.501 --> 55:33.120
You're going to jail. Tie him up.

56:11.235 --> 56:14.088
Oh, my. My, my my.

56:14.805 --> 56:16.823
This is a sad thing.

56:22.780 --> 56:25.654
Ain't this ironic? You wanna save a nigger?

56:25.734 --> 56:28.001
Then you get to take his place.

56:28.552 --> 56:32.243
I am a U.S. Marshal.
You will catch hell for this.

56:32.323 --> 56:35.575
Already been there. Wasn't impressed.

56:43.100 --> 56:44.952
Ready, boy?

56:49.390 --> 56:51.625
Not sharp enough for you?

56:54.333 --> 56:58.564
Please, sir, this is a mistake.
He is innocent of these charges.

56:58.848 --> 57:00.663
Is he?

57:04.655 --> 57:06.945
I can't be certain of that, ma'am.

57:08.959 --> 57:10.814
All women are to be cherished.

57:10.894 --> 57:13.523
Now what kind of a message
would it send to the...

57:13.732 --> 57:18.056
...the God-fearing people of this town
were I to allow a crime to go unpunished?

57:18.136 --> 57:21.155
Not to mention the hooligans in this town.

57:23.641 --> 57:25.660
I shudder at the thought.

57:34.886 --> 57:36.500
This is your doing.

57:37.521 --> 57:40.340
Yeah, well, you never
really know someone, do you?

57:45.196 --> 57:48.451
I suppose the accusations could be false...

57:48.531 --> 57:51.288
...but, of course,
that's for a judge to decide.

57:51.368 --> 57:55.310
In the meantime, I am obligated to protect...

57:55.390 --> 57:58.253
...the women of this town, and, of course...

57:59.443 --> 58:02.132
...that includes you, Miss Collins.

58:03.914 --> 58:05.966
Ain't that right, Ginny?

58:30.041 --> 58:31.859
You know...

58:32.376 --> 58:34.794
...I never noticed before what a...

58:35.580 --> 58:38.400
...remarkably fine figure of a woman you are.

58:38.480 --> 58:40.311
You stop this right now.

58:40.391 --> 58:45.011
This territory is about to experience
a new beginning and I'm gonna lead it.

58:45.890 --> 58:48.018
I'm an ambitious man and...

58:48.328 --> 58:53.246
...well, it sure would be fine
to have a smart, strong...

58:56.535 --> 58:58.752
...beautiful woman at my side.

59:04.758 --> 59:07.248
Your words are of the devil's tongue.

59:07.928 --> 59:11.521
Well, don't you go
flattering me, Miss Collins.

59:35.005 --> 59:38.662
You know what happens
to rapists in this territory.

59:38.742 --> 59:40.599
We hang 'em.

59:40.979 --> 59:43.234
If he was to be cleared of these charges...

59:43.314 --> 59:46.138
...well, he'd be free to just go
on doing what he has been doing...

59:46.218 --> 59:49.197
...and I got to tell you,
that just doesn't work for me.

59:52.923 --> 59:54.441
Hey.

59:56.661 --> 59:58.703
Aren't you gonna invite me in?

59:58.783 --> 01:00:00.881
Of course, baby.

01:00:30.161 --> 01:00:33.446
- There you go.
- Thank you.

01:00:35.867 --> 01:00:37.956
You know, you're missing the show.

01:00:38.636 --> 01:00:40.862
Why don't you come on back out with me?

01:00:40.942 --> 01:00:44.261
Let me just, uh, clean myself up for you...

01:00:44.341 --> 01:00:46.106
...and I'll meet you out there, baby.

01:00:48.512 --> 01:00:51.599
Please, I'll do anything.
I'll make him leave.

01:00:54.558 --> 01:00:57.814
Well, I guess I could drop
the charges. After all...

01:00:57.894 --> 01:01:00.167
...they were leveled by a whore.

01:01:02.693 --> 01:01:04.744
Revolting profession.

01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:12.385
That's enough!

01:01:16.608 --> 01:01:18.691
Cut him down.

01:01:22.486 --> 01:01:24.434
You, uh...

01:01:24.514 --> 01:01:26.607
...want something before you go?

01:02:22.823 --> 01:02:24.690
You know...

01:02:25.343 --> 01:02:28.562
...you really would make a fine first lady.

01:02:30.347 --> 01:02:32.396
You don't fucking leave me.

01:02:34.819 --> 01:02:37.109
- Reb, no.
- Yeah.

01:03:01.980 --> 01:03:03.564
Yeah.

01:03:15.427 --> 01:03:18.028
It's over. It's over.

01:03:27.005 --> 01:03:29.658
- No.
- Out of our way, ma'am. Up, up, up.

01:03:45.288 --> 01:03:49.187
We have to get James out of jail.
He didn't do anything.

01:03:49.267 --> 01:03:51.542
What do you expect me to do? Break him out?

01:03:52.062 --> 01:03:54.082
They're gonna kill him, Daddy.

01:04:07.678 --> 01:04:10.067
We're gonna meet by the old church.

01:04:10.147 --> 01:04:12.031
I'll be there.

01:04:15.154 --> 01:04:18.465
- I'm gonna need your help.
- You got it.

01:04:18.545 --> 01:04:21.240
A group of us are meeting by the old church.

01:04:22.893 --> 01:04:24.777
Thank you.

01:04:44.181 --> 01:04:46.671
<i>Now, y'all know my daughter Melissa...</i>

01:04:46.751 --> 01:04:49.386
<i>...and I'd like you to hear her out.</i>

01:04:50.054 --> 01:04:51.687
Good morning.

01:04:52.357 --> 01:04:55.776
There's no stage. There's no church.

01:04:56.895 --> 01:04:58.779
No minister.

01:04:59.663 --> 01:05:02.149
All that remains is tinder and ash.

01:05:04.802 --> 01:05:06.857
A good man did stand here once...

01:05:06.937 --> 01:05:09.327
...right here where I stand now.

01:05:09.407 --> 01:05:12.205
His name was Reverend Thomas McCord.

01:05:13.945 --> 01:05:15.796
He wasn't born here.

01:05:16.882 --> 01:05:18.900
He owed us nothing.

01:05:19.717 --> 01:05:23.107
He only dreamed to see this town,
to see the people in it...

01:05:23.187 --> 01:05:25.440
...reach their full potential.

01:05:26.959 --> 01:05:28.777
That's why he died.

01:05:30.362 --> 01:05:31.977
But you know that.

01:05:32.730 --> 01:05:34.584
Damn us.

01:05:34.664 --> 01:05:37.918
Yes, I say damn us.

01:05:39.071 --> 01:05:43.293
Where were we when he stood up
against the tyranny of our oppressors?

01:05:43.373 --> 01:05:46.964
Where were we when he pointed his
fingers at the men who steal our homes...

01:05:47.044 --> 01:05:49.300
...take food from our children's mouths?

01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:51.199
Where were we?

01:05:57.017 --> 01:05:59.310
Reverend McCord gave his life for us...

01:05:59.390 --> 01:06:02.677
...and none of us had the backbone
to stand with him.

01:06:03.962 --> 01:06:05.884
We let him down.

01:06:05.964 --> 01:06:08.216
We let our children down...

01:06:08.598 --> 01:06:10.833
...and I'm ashamed of that.

01:06:12.035 --> 01:06:13.403
Mayor Pierce...

01:06:13.483 --> 01:06:16.905
...and his former Confederate soldier
colleagues intend to claim this territory...

01:06:16.985 --> 01:06:20.063
...as a new republic
and overthrow our president.

01:06:20.143 --> 01:06:22.567
Right now he is compiling
an arsenal of weapons...

01:06:22.647 --> 01:06:24.904
...and he expects more men
to arrive here shortly.

01:06:24.984 --> 01:06:28.147
- How do you know this?
- We've seen the weapons.

01:06:28.227 --> 01:06:32.042
And Marshal McCord has been working
with the army to uncover their operation.

01:06:32.122 --> 01:06:34.728
Marshal McCord's gonna get himself strung up.

01:06:34.808 --> 01:06:36.916
He has the backing of federal troops...

01:06:36.996 --> 01:06:40.052
...and he's the only man
willing to take on our mayor.

01:06:40.132 --> 01:06:42.240
He needs our help.

01:06:42.320 --> 01:06:46.423
We are strong enough right now
to do what needs doing.

01:06:46.503 --> 01:06:49.295
But when the mayor's reinforcements
arrive, we will be outnumbered...

01:06:49.475 --> 01:06:51.759
...and if the army intervenes...

01:06:52.161 --> 01:06:55.011
...then our town will become a battlefield.

01:06:55.713 --> 01:06:57.637
I'm not gonna be a slave again.

01:06:57.717 --> 01:07:02.333
I moved out west with my boy
to start a new life as free men.

01:07:04.523 --> 01:07:08.179
It ain't been easy,
but it's damn sure better than it was.

01:07:08.259 --> 01:07:12.452
The marshal, he done save
my boy Abraham from a lashing.

01:07:12.532 --> 01:07:17.069
He come to my aid too when Reb's
boys was trying to burn my hand...

01:07:17.149 --> 01:07:19.239
...and shake me down.

01:07:20.871 --> 01:07:23.227
And his brother, God rest his soul...

01:07:23.307 --> 01:07:26.794
...has been there for all of us,
one way or another.

01:07:28.012 --> 01:07:29.835
Count me in.

01:07:29.915 --> 01:07:31.666
Thank you, Benjamin.

01:07:33.583 --> 01:07:37.508
There's some scripture
the reverend used to quote often.

01:07:37.588 --> 01:07:40.041
Proverbs 21:15.

01:07:40.925 --> 01:07:44.148
"It is joy to the just to do judgment...

01:07:44.528 --> 01:07:48.581
...but destruction shall come
to the workers of iniquity."

01:07:50.635 --> 01:07:53.086
Justice is present.

01:07:53.838 --> 01:07:56.089
We just have to let him loose.

01:07:56.787 --> 01:08:00.586
- It's time we take a stand.
- Let's get those sons of bitches.

01:08:00.666 --> 01:08:05.136
Anyone willing to help me
get James out of jail, step forward.

01:08:16.995 --> 01:08:19.685
- Howdy?
- What you got in the bag?

01:08:19.765 --> 01:08:21.841
Well, let's have a little look-see.

01:08:21.921 --> 01:08:25.279
My daughter Melissa put together
some things for the marshal.

01:08:25.359 --> 01:08:27.888
You do it nice and slow-like.

01:08:27.968 --> 01:08:30.769
Yes. Lookee here. Fried chicken.

01:08:30.849 --> 01:08:34.531
Sounds like your girlfriend's
done brought us some dinner.

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:37.468
We's might even toss you a bone to suck on.

01:08:37.948 --> 01:08:41.234
Oh, lookee here. Apple pie.

01:08:44.154 --> 01:08:46.756
Her mother makes the best apple pie.

01:08:46.836 --> 01:08:48.709
Boiled eggs.

01:08:49.428 --> 01:08:51.924
Oh, some more boiled eggs.

01:08:52.004 --> 01:08:55.871
Just put it all back
in the sack there and hand it over.

01:08:55.951 --> 01:08:58.957
- Oh, she didn't.
- What?

01:08:59.037 --> 01:09:02.921
Put this big ol' gun in here. Now,
you back it up. Right now, right now.

01:09:03.001 --> 01:09:07.060
Go on. Back in there.
Put that gun on the table.

01:09:08.527 --> 01:09:10.363
Give me the key.

01:09:10.951 --> 01:09:13.544
- Give me the damn key.
- I ain't got it.

01:09:19.024 --> 01:09:20.885
"First of these duties...

01:09:20.965 --> 01:09:22.943
...is to educate democracy...

01:09:23.023 --> 01:09:25.384
...to reawaken its religious beliefs...

01:09:25.464 --> 01:09:27.350
...to make an awareness to"...

01:09:27.430 --> 01:09:29.888
Sir, there's a ruckus at the jailhouse!

01:09:29.968 --> 01:09:32.019
What kind of a ruckus?

01:09:32.683 --> 01:09:34.224
- And you're here?
- I came to tell you.

01:09:34.304 --> 01:09:36.310
Get back over there.

01:09:38.810 --> 01:09:42.880
Reb, you get on down to that jail
before they break the marshal out.

01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:46.461
- Won't be that easy without these.
- Just get on down there.

01:09:47.518 --> 01:09:50.975
- Where are the keys?
- I ain't got it.

01:09:51.055 --> 01:09:53.778
Someone better start talking.
I ain't asking again.

01:09:54.358 --> 01:09:56.176
Reb has it.

01:10:00.399 --> 01:10:02.917
Thought these might come in handy.

01:10:12.980 --> 01:10:15.119
Well, hello there, young lady.
Come take a seat.

01:10:15.199 --> 01:10:19.575
- There's no time for that. James is in jail.
- There's some nasty charges against him.

01:10:19.655 --> 01:10:24.024
All false. Right now my father is trying
to break him out. He needs your help.

01:10:24.104 --> 01:10:26.944
You're asking me to help you
break a man out of prison?

01:10:27.024 --> 01:10:28.907
Yes, I am.

01:10:44.542 --> 01:10:45.939
Thank you.

01:11:00.725 --> 01:11:03.015
Please, help them.

01:11:03.095 --> 01:11:05.083
Men, stand to horse!

01:11:08.067 --> 01:11:11.756
- How many of them you got out there?
- Two, three, maybe four.

01:11:11.836 --> 01:11:15.450
- In other words, you don't know.
- No, I do not.

01:11:17.042 --> 01:11:19.060
If we stay here, we're dead.

01:11:20.245 --> 01:11:21.834
I'll draw their fire.

01:11:21.914 --> 01:11:26.070
When I open the door, you guys run
like hell. Unload everything you got.

01:11:26.150 --> 01:11:28.790
- That's suicide.
- Have a little faith.

01:11:33.392 --> 01:11:35.480
Hold your fire.

01:11:35.560 --> 01:11:37.816
No one shoots the marshal.

01:11:37.896 --> 01:11:39.851
He's mine.

01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:43.951
Hold your fire, goddamn it.

01:11:47.639 --> 01:11:51.293
Gave me all the excuse I need
to put a bullet in your head.

01:11:52.144 --> 01:11:53.931
Rapist.

01:11:54.011 --> 01:11:56.435
Holding two sheriff's deputies hostage.

01:11:57.015 --> 01:11:59.871
Breaking out of jail. No, sir,
don't get much better than that.

01:11:59.951 --> 01:12:02.037
There's good men in here.

01:12:03.153 --> 01:12:06.993
- You can have me. Just let them go.
- Sorry, can't do that.

01:12:07.073 --> 01:12:08.743
Accessory to the crime and all.

01:12:09.828 --> 01:12:13.351
If I come out shooting,
a lot of your men are gonna die.

01:12:13.431 --> 01:12:16.351
- Maybe you, Reb.
- Maybe.

01:12:16.434 --> 01:12:18.357
But I've seen enough death.

01:12:18.437 --> 01:12:20.892
I've took enough lives.
If it's my time, so be it.

01:12:20.972 --> 01:12:23.027
Doesn't have to be that way.

01:12:23.807 --> 01:12:27.565
Give me your word as a soldier
that you'll let these men go...

01:12:27.645 --> 01:12:30.063
...and you can have me... you win.

01:12:33.902 --> 01:12:35.920
This is Mayor Pierce.

01:12:36.622 --> 01:12:38.443
You have my word.

01:12:38.923 --> 01:12:42.808
You walk out of there peacefully,
I'll honor your request.

01:12:43.627 --> 01:12:45.912
I have your word, Mayor?

01:12:47.398 --> 01:12:49.251
As a gentleman.

01:12:51.067 --> 01:12:53.487
Well, that makes me feel better.

01:12:55.653 --> 01:12:58.675
Listen, I'm going out there.

01:12:59.644 --> 01:13:02.901
If they drop me, you come out firing.

01:13:03.281 --> 01:13:05.536
Don't look back. Get to your families.

01:13:06.416 --> 01:13:08.235
I'm coming out!

01:13:29.875 --> 01:13:32.092
That's far enough, McCord.

01:13:33.611 --> 01:13:35.165
Drop your rifle.

01:13:37.116 --> 01:13:39.801
Undo your belt strap, drop it to the floor.

01:13:52.363 --> 01:13:54.180
What now?

01:13:54.798 --> 01:13:58.251
You know, your brother was brave, like you.

01:13:59.236 --> 01:14:01.055
Until he wasn't.

01:14:01.641 --> 01:14:06.097
He kept pushing and pushing
until he pushed a little too far.

01:14:06.277 --> 01:14:10.474
- You shut up.
- He squealed like a sow...

01:14:10.554 --> 01:14:12.145
...as he burned to death.

01:15:15.831 --> 01:15:19.067
- Stratton, you still with me?
- You bet I am!

01:15:34.525 --> 01:15:38.603
It's over for you, Marshal.
You're outgunned by 20 men.

01:15:42.640 --> 01:15:44.358
Eighteen.

01:16:12.854 --> 01:16:14.489
Ben?

01:16:14.974 --> 01:16:16.517
Ben?

01:16:24.048 --> 01:16:26.342
Look out for my boy...

01:16:26.622 --> 01:16:28.365
...Abraham.

01:17:58.408 --> 01:18:00.459
This ain't over yet.

01:18:01.246 --> 01:18:03.889
- Get your father home. Stay there.
- Wait, I'm coming with you.

01:18:03.969 --> 01:18:07.067
No, sir. This is something
I have to do alone.

01:18:08.852 --> 01:18:11.572
- Keep her safe.
- Be careful.

01:18:19.029 --> 01:18:21.585
- Captain.
- Marshal.

01:18:21.665 --> 01:18:24.416
- Reb?
- No sign of him.

01:18:24.736 --> 01:18:27.903
This map will lead you to the cache.
That's where you'll find the mayor.

01:18:27.983 --> 01:18:30.962
- I'm going after Reb.
- You got a handle on him?

01:18:31.042 --> 01:18:33.060
I got an idea.

01:18:34.545 --> 01:18:36.362
Thank you.

01:19:37.809 --> 01:19:40.197
Took you long enough.

01:19:40.277 --> 01:19:42.095
I was busy.

01:19:43.215 --> 01:19:45.069
Why didn't you run?

01:19:45.449 --> 01:19:47.566
Men like you and me...

01:19:47.646 --> 01:19:49.644
...we don't run.

01:19:50.389 --> 01:19:52.274
Why is that?

01:19:53.425 --> 01:19:55.310
There's nowhere to run to.

01:19:56.194 --> 01:19:58.082
It's all the same.

01:19:58.162 --> 01:20:01.181
Blue, gray.

01:20:02.934 --> 01:20:05.419
Really don't matter at the end of the day.

01:20:06.170 --> 01:20:09.256
We're born, we buy this...

01:20:09.507 --> 01:20:11.325
...sell that...

01:20:12.344 --> 01:20:15.229
...die. That simple.

01:20:16.786 --> 01:20:18.921
You came here to die?

01:20:19.617 --> 01:20:21.469
We'll see.

01:20:31.096 --> 01:20:32.951
This was a nice church.

01:20:33.631 --> 01:20:36.717
I used to see folk come in and out of it.

01:20:38.436 --> 01:20:40.358
Never understood what they found.

01:20:43.708 --> 01:20:47.594
Your brother, for a guy
who never carried a gun...

01:20:48.247 --> 01:20:50.464
...he was a tough son of a bitch.

01:20:52.150 --> 01:20:54.035
I admired him.

01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:56.154
Funny way of showing it.

01:20:59.290 --> 01:21:01.341
Where's the compassion?

01:21:02.628 --> 01:21:04.688
Wrong McCord.

01:21:18.910 --> 01:21:21.012
<i>Now I am but one man...</i>

01:21:21.512 --> 01:21:23.965
...but I will not look the other way.

01:21:29.087 --> 01:21:33.174
<i>And we will rid the town of this evil.</i>

01:22:22.490 --> 01:22:24.359
Thank you, Brother.

01:23:11.788 --> 01:23:13.607
Hey there, little Brother.

01:23:16.828 --> 01:23:18.679
See you around.

01:23:36.914 --> 01:23:38.999
What you got there?

01:23:54.349 --> 01:23:56.034
What's your name, son?

01:24:48.571 --> 01:24:52.072
Collins family,
this is Benjamin's son, Abraham.

01:24:52.673 --> 01:24:54.996
Abraham, this is the Collins family.

01:24:55.076 --> 01:24:57.899
- Hi.
- Elizabeth.

01:24:57.979 --> 01:25:01.232
Stratton and, of course, Melissa.

01:25:01.683 --> 01:25:04.798
- Hello, Abraham. Welcome.
- Thank you.

01:25:04.878 --> 01:25:07.371
Come on. Let's get you something to drink.

01:25:28.477 --> 01:25:31.899
We're, uh, rebuilding the church.

01:25:32.079 --> 01:25:33.964
Thanks to you.

01:25:38.020 --> 01:25:41.104
- Where you heading?
- South.

01:25:41.622 --> 01:25:43.841
Some folks need help down there.

01:25:45.259 --> 01:25:47.043
You could come.

01:25:49.131 --> 01:25:51.272
As much as I'd love to, I...

01:25:51.352 --> 01:25:53.590
...think I've found my calling too.

01:25:55.436 --> 01:25:57.654
Thomas would be proud.

01:25:58.173 --> 01:25:59.992
Of both of us.

01:26:01.477 --> 01:26:03.532
Will you be gone long?

01:26:03.912 --> 01:26:05.716
I think so.

01:26:05.796 --> 01:26:07.598
Are you coming back?

01:26:08.934 --> 01:26:10.682
Sure.

01:26:13.689 --> 01:26:16.541
Not as good of a liar as your brother was.

01:26:17.339 --> 01:26:18.940
I ain't him.

01:26:20.589 --> 01:26:23.328
Tail side of the same nickel, Mr. McCord.

01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:28.199
I guess.
