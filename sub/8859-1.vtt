01:59.040 --> 02:00.280
Help me.

02:09.320 --> 02:10.731
Somebody there?

02:12.400 --> 02:13.526
I'm hurt.

02:15.520 --> 02:16.521
Is somebody there?

02:18.280 --> 02:19.406
Please.

02:20.320 --> 02:21.367
I'm bleeding.

02:25.400 --> 02:26.401
Help me.

02:34.400 --> 02:35.500
Drop your weapon.

02:35.600 --> 02:36.840
You drop yours first.

02:39.240 --> 02:40.241
Drop it!

02:51.720 --> 02:52.846
Okay.

02:54.080 --> 02:55.366
Your turn.

02:59.040 --> 03:00.201
Let me see your other hand.

03:01.240 --> 03:04.050
If I move this hand,
I'm afraid my stomach will fall out.

03:04.720 --> 03:06.324
I need to see your other hand.

03:09.680 --> 03:11.728
- What's in your hand?
- Nothing.

03:12.600 --> 03:13.647
Drop your weapon.

03:14.320 --> 03:15.446
What's in your hand?

03:46.040 --> 03:47.883
I miss the Cassie I was.

03:55.320 --> 03:56.420
Hey.

03:56.520 --> 03:59.171
A totally normal high school girl.

04:00.000 --> 04:02.500
- Hey! How you doing?
- Hi! Good.

04:02.600 --> 04:03.940
- Cheers.
- Thank you. Cheers.

04:04.040 --> 04:06.691
I wonder what that Cassie
would think of me now

04:07.760 --> 04:09.000
The Cassie who kills.

04:16.600 --> 04:18.579
You know, he was supposed to be here.

04:18.680 --> 04:19.805
Who?

04:21.519 --> 04:24.126
Why are the hot ones always so unreliable?

04:24.240 --> 04:25.940
What would I even say to him?

04:26.040 --> 04:28.500
I don't know him,
and he doesn't even know me.

04:28.600 --> 04:30.364
You're a girl. He's a boy.

04:31.240 --> 04:33.500
- Your parts go together.
- Don't.

04:33.600 --> 04:34.726
God.

04:35.360 --> 04:37.140
- Okay, Liz.
- What?

04:37.240 --> 04:38.685
I'm gonna see you Monday.

04:39.640 --> 04:41.380
I gotta go home.

04:41.480 --> 04:42.460
Skedaddle.

04:42.560 --> 04:43.607
Okay.

04:43.720 --> 04:45.980
- Honey, love you.
- I love you.

04:46.080 --> 04:47.660
- Bye.
- Text me when you're home.

04:47.760 --> 04:48.761
Okay.

05:02.520 --> 05:03.521
Hey.

05:05.240 --> 05:06.241
Hey.

05:11.360 --> 05:12.930
Nice phone case.

05:13.920 --> 05:16.491
What? You have something against pink?

05:17.800 --> 05:19.620
No, no. I totally like it.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.926
I'm just kidding.

05:22.440 --> 05:23.780
This is actually my sister's phone.

05:23.880 --> 05:27.487
I dropped her off at a sleepover,
and she took mine by mistake.

05:27.920 --> 05:29.524
Mine's much cooler.

05:29.840 --> 05:31.251
It's Spider-Man.

05:33.960 --> 05:35.246
Polka dots.

05:39.880 --> 05:41.166
That's her.

05:41.720 --> 05:42.721
Hey.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.740
Yeah, yeah, I have it.

05:44.840 --> 05:46.968
No, I haven't looked
at your text messages.

05:47.400 --> 05:49.164
"Nice phone case"?

05:49.720 --> 05:50.960
Right.

06:01.520 --> 06:04.205
I'm Captain Lochner.
This is Sergeant Nicolai.

06:04.600 --> 06:06.060
- Hello.
- How do you do?

06:06.160 --> 06:07.969
I'm sorry. No more coffee.

06:09.280 --> 06:12.090
Miss Gray, do you know this gentleman?

06:30.800 --> 06:32.211
Sing me a song.

06:33.320 --> 06:34.481
A song?

06:35.640 --> 06:37.005
Okay, close your eyes.

06:40.320 --> 06:43.220
Bones sinking like stones

06:43.320 --> 06:45.891
All that we fought for

06:47.400 --> 06:48.970
I didn't know it then,

06:50.400 --> 06:52.260
but that was the last
normal day of my life.

06:52.360 --> 06:54.362
All of us are done for

06:58.760 --> 07:03.209
When you're in high school, just about
everything feels like the end of the world.

07:04.080 --> 07:05.206
Can you believe what happened?

07:05.320 --> 07:06.460
No.

07:06.560 --> 07:09.020
An early curfew, a final exam...

07:09.120 --> 07:11.220
- Hey, Ben!
- Stop it.

07:11.320 --> 07:12.526
Soccer practise.

07:13.880 --> 07:15.860
Sullivan. What are we doing out here?

07:15.960 --> 07:18.361
Why not just tell her
where you're gonna kick it?

07:20.600 --> 07:21.940
Come on, let's go.

07:22.040 --> 07:25.260
Hey, check it out.
Look at this. It's so freaky.

07:25.360 --> 07:26.860
- Watch.
- I can't see anything.

07:26.960 --> 07:28.530
Oh, my God, Altschuler.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.380
That's it. You're done. Off the field.

07:31.480 --> 07:33.420
No. But, look, it's really weird.

07:33.520 --> 07:36.729
Off! Goodbye. AdiÃ³s.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.963
- What's going on?
- Panthers, let's go! Hustle up!

07:41.280 --> 07:43.380
Give me your phone. Give me your phone.

07:43.480 --> 07:44.940
Mine doesn't work!

07:45.040 --> 07:46.280
- It totally just stopped.
- All right, Perkins.

07:46.400 --> 07:50.087
Turns out, what we thought
was the end of the world

07:50.920 --> 07:51.940
wasn't.

07:52.040 --> 07:53.940
What, did someone famous die or something?

07:54.040 --> 07:56.964
It appears to be metallic
and of a considerable size.

07:57.520 --> 08:01.580
Across the world, social media has been
awash with panic and speculation

08:01.680 --> 08:03.740
as these images spread like wildfire.

08:03.840 --> 08:07.900
The president has authorised NASA
to attempt communication with the object

08:08.000 --> 08:10.082
that is now circling our planet

08:10.640 --> 08:14.565
and is currently over the United States,
moving west over Ohio.

08:14.680 --> 08:16.140
Oh, my God. It's right over us.

08:16.240 --> 08:17.526
I wanna see!

08:17.640 --> 08:19.380
- Hey.
- No, Sam. Wait.

08:19.480 --> 08:21.060
Sam, wait!

08:21.160 --> 08:22.400
- You can see it!
- Come here!

08:22.520 --> 08:23.660
Look up there, hon.

08:23.760 --> 08:25.922
- Wait, what is that?
- I have no idea.

08:45.240 --> 08:49.962
There were no messages from our galactic
party crashers during the first 10 days.

08:50.720 --> 08:53.371
But pretty soon, they had a name.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.860
We called them "the Others."

08:56.960 --> 08:58.740
The Wilsons are leaving, too?

08:58.840 --> 09:00.729
They say they don't feel safe
so close to the city.

09:08.800 --> 09:09.926
Okay.

09:11.080 --> 09:12.127
Is this everyone?

09:16.040 --> 09:17.326
Well, okay.

09:18.880 --> 09:20.848
Everybody look
at the equation on the board.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.166
Who can give me the derivative of X?

09:26.520 --> 09:27.760
Anybody?

09:29.960 --> 09:31.007
Anyone?

09:32.680 --> 09:33.681
What...

09:34.480 --> 09:36.180
I'm sure this is just a power outage.

09:36.280 --> 09:37.327
My phone's not working.

09:38.000 --> 09:39.420
What's going on?

09:39.520 --> 09:40.660
Over here.

09:40.760 --> 09:41.921
What on Earth?

09:47.720 --> 09:49.563
My goodness. What's going on?

09:53.640 --> 09:54.580
Look at that!

09:54.680 --> 09:55.966
Back up! Back up!

10:07.840 --> 10:12.721
The Others hit us with an electromagnetic
pulse that killed all the power on the planet.

10:13.480 --> 10:15.260
No more engines.

10:15.360 --> 10:17.340
No more electricity

10:17.440 --> 10:19.249
No more running water.

10:20.160 --> 10:22.970
No more everything we took for granted.

10:26.760 --> 10:29.366
That was the last time I saw Ben Parish.

10:30.440 --> 10:31.680
I guess he's dead now

10:32.640 --> 10:34.722
Like everyone else in that room.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.884
Here, Sam. Grab me another, okay?
Thank you.

10:43.000 --> 10:44.729
That was the 1st Wave.

10:46.320 --> 10:48.846
At the time, we thought that was it.

10:50.280 --> 10:51.441
Then the 2nd Wave hit.

10:55.720 --> 10:57.449
Come on, Sam. It's an earthquake!

10:59.800 --> 11:01.211
- Cassie!
- Watch out!

11:03.520 --> 11:05.204
- Cassie!
- Come on!

11:06.440 --> 11:07.900
Go! Go! It's okay!

11:08.000 --> 11:09.206
Cassie!

11:09.760 --> 11:11.569
It's okay. It's okay.

11:13.200 --> 11:14.611
Just keep your head down, okay?

11:24.560 --> 11:25.561
What's that noise?

11:33.760 --> 11:34.807
Sam, run!

11:51.640 --> 11:52.971
- Go!
- Cassie!

11:55.440 --> 11:56.726
Go on!

11:58.480 --> 11:59.481
Cassie!

12:09.320 --> 12:12.164
- Cassie! Hurry!
- I'm okay. Just climb!

12:13.360 --> 12:15.044
- Go, Sam! Go!
- Cassie!

12:17.040 --> 12:19.247
Come here. Hold on to me.

12:20.440 --> 12:21.601
Cassie!

12:35.400 --> 12:38.768
In Ohio, we only had the lake
to worry about.

12:39.840 --> 12:41.330
But by the ocean,

12:42.320 --> 12:43.651
I can only imagine.

13:45.000 --> 13:46.809
Every coastal city

13:47.560 --> 13:49.300
every island,

13:49.400 --> 13:50.447
gone.

14:09.440 --> 14:13.411
There are over 300 billion birds
in the world.

14:14.320 --> 14:17.244
That's 75 birds for every person.

14:20.000 --> 14:23.800
Mom said the avian flu was already
one of the world's deadliest viruses.

14:28.840 --> 14:31.446
In the 3rd Wave, the Others modified it.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.043
Made it unstoppable.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.080
And the birds spread it across the planet.

14:41.840 --> 14:47.165
Line A. Line A is for those
who have already been assessed.

14:47.520 --> 14:52.242
If you're waiting to be assessed,
then proceed to Line B.

14:52.680 --> 14:54.967
No pedal pulse, no brachial, nothing.

14:55.080 --> 14:56.081
Sit down, sir. Thank you.

14:58.040 --> 14:59.041
Just head straight on back.

14:59.640 --> 15:01.420
I ain't happy over here.

15:01.520 --> 15:02.931
I feel fine!

15:05.160 --> 15:07.447
I should be on the area
that isn't quarantined!

15:10.560 --> 15:11.766
Hey, Liz!

15:14.440 --> 15:16.220
- Hey.
- Your mom said you were here.

15:16.320 --> 15:18.540
- Cassie! Cassie.
- Mom?

15:18.640 --> 15:19.700
What are you...

15:19.800 --> 15:20.900
She's quarantined.

15:21.000 --> 15:24.209
- It's okay. I didn't even touch her.
- It is not okay. You can't be here.

15:25.680 --> 15:27.020
I'm sorry.

15:27.120 --> 15:30.700
Sweetheart, I need you to go home
and look after Sammy, okay?

15:30.800 --> 15:32.086
But, Mom, I wanna help you here.

15:32.200 --> 15:34.851
- I know. Can you get her out of here now?
- I wanna help.

15:35.480 --> 15:37.767
- Mom.
- No, it's okay. Just go.

15:38.600 --> 15:40.841
Miss, you gotta leave. Let's go.

15:46.480 --> 15:48.369
- Quarantine six.
- In six.

15:48.840 --> 15:51.366
Some people were immune to the virus.

15:52.960 --> 15:56.407
And a few people got sick
and somehow recovered.

16:00.000 --> 16:01.490
But most people didn't.

17:08.119 --> 17:09.121
Hey.

17:15.800 --> 17:17.768
You can't wear those shoes.

17:22.280 --> 17:24.328
Why don't they just get it over with?

17:25.240 --> 17:26.765
What do they want?

17:27.400 --> 17:29.880
I think a better question is,
"What do they need?"

17:31.080 --> 17:32.620
They've been very careful so far

17:32.720 --> 17:36.122
not to damage it
any more than absolutely necessary.

17:37.080 --> 17:38.491
Damage what?

17:40.800 --> 17:41.847
Earth.

17:43.560 --> 17:46.131
I think that's why they're here, Cassie.

17:47.280 --> 17:48.645
They need the Earth.

17:50.960 --> 17:52.325
But not us.

17:52.720 --> 17:53.846
No, not us.

17:59.320 --> 18:01.060
Ready to walk for a while, Sammy?

18:01.160 --> 18:02.340
Yeah.

18:02.440 --> 18:03.487
Okay.

18:24.520 --> 18:26.780
Dad, how far is it to the refugee camp?

18:26.880 --> 18:29.850
Just a few miles.
We should be there by nightfall.

18:41.960 --> 18:45.009
- Dad, look. Is this it?
- Yeah, buddy. I think so.

18:46.160 --> 18:48.020
Hey. Welcome.

18:48.120 --> 18:49.940
Thanks. Hi.

18:50.040 --> 18:51.530
Name's Hutchfield.

18:52.800 --> 18:53.860
Hi. See ya.

18:53.960 --> 18:55.086
Let me show you around.

18:57.600 --> 18:59.523
Latrines are off to the left.

19:00.640 --> 19:02.483
Farm is out that way.

19:06.080 --> 19:07.700
You got fresh water?

19:07.800 --> 19:09.848
Yeah. Not too bad, huh?

19:13.840 --> 19:15.260
How many people are there here?

19:15.360 --> 19:17.442
I don't know how many we got now.

19:18.200 --> 19:19.645
305, something like that.

19:20.440 --> 19:22.220
Dining hall over here.

19:22.320 --> 19:24.209
When's the last time you had a hot meal?

19:28.000 --> 19:30.765
Good. Well, maybe you can
walk me through it.

19:31.800 --> 19:33.325
Here we draw a purple hat.

19:33.440 --> 19:34.965
Can we get some water over here?

19:40.120 --> 19:42.009
- Dad.
- This is a Colt .45.

19:44.640 --> 19:45.880
Okay?

19:46.880 --> 19:49.042
This button changes out the clip.

19:51.720 --> 19:52.960
That's loaded.

19:56.680 --> 19:58.125
All right? Safety on.

19:59.200 --> 20:00.406
Safety off.

20:01.640 --> 20:02.820
Listen to me.

20:02.920 --> 20:04.940
You're gonna carry this
with you at all times,

20:05.040 --> 20:06.940
you're not gonna tell anybody you have it,

20:07.040 --> 20:09.884
and you're only gonna use it
if it's life or death. You got it?

20:20.160 --> 20:21.764
I thought we were safe here.

20:26.280 --> 20:28.681
Pumpkin, there's nothing safe any more.

20:46.760 --> 20:48.100
Here, you wanna put it in the basket?

20:48.200 --> 20:49.281
Okay.

20:51.960 --> 20:54.008
- Here. Take this one.
- Okay.

20:54.760 --> 20:56.330
You gotta get the weeds, guys.

20:58.600 --> 20:59.965
What was that?

21:03.600 --> 21:04.806
Sam, come here.

21:06.520 --> 21:09.260
- What is that?
- I don't know. Come on.

21:09.360 --> 21:10.380
Asher, come on!

21:10.480 --> 21:11.527
Mommy!

21:13.800 --> 21:15.040
Dad!

21:18.520 --> 21:19.885
What is that?

21:20.600 --> 21:22.260
- You see Dad?
- Dad!

21:22.360 --> 21:23.860
- Cassie?
- Hey, Dad.

21:23.960 --> 21:25.121
Hey.

21:25.880 --> 21:28.008
- What's going on?
- All right, just take it easy.

21:38.800 --> 21:40.290
I thought the cars didn't work.

22:07.960 --> 22:10.804
Ladies and gentlemen, I am Colonel Vosch
of the United States Army

22:11.600 --> 22:14.843
My men and I are from
the Wright-Patterson Air Force Base.

22:16.600 --> 22:17.601
We're here to help.

22:18.040 --> 22:19.460
It's about time.

22:19.560 --> 22:20.925
Let's get you people out of here.

22:21.560 --> 22:22.500
- Heck, yeah!
- Thank you.

22:22.600 --> 22:23.601
Yes!

22:23.720 --> 22:25.006
U.S.A.!

22:25.280 --> 22:27.060
We should be ready to go
at a moment's notice, all right?

22:27.160 --> 22:28.571
Stay with your sister, Sam.

22:29.440 --> 22:31.681
- Come on.
- You can go right on the bus.

22:32.720 --> 22:36.008
Adults, please move to the mess hall
for a briefing.

22:36.640 --> 22:39.962
Children, please move
to the buses for transport.

22:42.200 --> 22:43.580
We're right behind you. Be good!

22:43.680 --> 22:46.524
Adults, please move to the mess hall
for a briefing.

22:47.040 --> 22:48.980
Do you think they have electricity
if the trucks are working?

22:49.080 --> 22:51.380
I don't know. Why, you still have a phone?

22:51.480 --> 22:52.606
Yeah.

22:53.280 --> 22:54.980
- You have a charger?
- Of course, yeah.

22:55.080 --> 22:56.180
- Sir, sir.
- Yeah?

22:56.280 --> 22:58.900
My orders are to get
just the kids onto the bus.

22:59.000 --> 23:01.060
Well, those might be your orders,
but they're my kids.

23:01.160 --> 23:02.700
- Yeah.
- So we're gonna stay together.

23:02.800 --> 23:04.802
- We'll wait for another bus.
- It's okay, Private.

23:05.560 --> 23:06.686
I got this.

23:07.280 --> 23:09.203
- Yes, sir.
- Thank you.

23:12.040 --> 23:15.700
Look, you're welcome to keep 'em here
with you if you want,

23:15.800 --> 23:17.802
but if they were my kids,
I'd get 'em on that bus.

23:18.160 --> 23:19.161
Why?

23:20.800 --> 23:23.485
We have reason to believe
there's an imminent threat to this location.

23:24.400 --> 23:26.687
We're trying to get everyone to safety
as quickly as we can,

23:26.800 --> 23:28.380
and this is the only
working transpo we've got,

23:28.480 --> 23:29.811
so we're taking shifts based on need.

23:30.560 --> 23:32.528
Kids first, then we come back
for the rest of ya.

23:33.360 --> 23:35.203
Well, how safe is it at Wright-Patterson?

23:35.520 --> 23:37.249
Safest place there is right now.

23:38.000 --> 23:39.540
And the buses will just come right back?

23:39.640 --> 23:40.687
Dad, no.

23:41.680 --> 23:43.444
Drop 'em off, come right back.

23:46.120 --> 23:48.088
Like I said, it's your call.

23:50.120 --> 23:52.420
Just 'cause some man in uniform
tries to tell us what to do

23:52.520 --> 23:54.420
doesn't mean we actually have to
follow his orders.

23:54.520 --> 23:56.220
Okay, I want you on this one, all right?

23:56.320 --> 23:57.700
- I'll be right behind you.
- We can't split up.

23:57.800 --> 24:00.380
And we're gonna have dinner tonight.
We're going to the same place.

24:00.480 --> 24:01.420
- Dad, no.
- Cassie.

24:01.520 --> 24:04.900
It's the Army, okay? This is our Army.
It's fine. It's gonna be okay.

24:05.000 --> 24:06.081
- Don't leave me alone.
- All right. Come here.

24:06.680 --> 24:07.806
I love you.

24:08.040 --> 24:10.327
Take care of your brother.
All right? Come here.

24:11.280 --> 24:13.420
I want you to listen
to your sister, all right?

24:13.520 --> 24:14.521
- Okay.
- She's in charge.

24:14.640 --> 24:15.880
- Okay?
- Dad.

24:16.760 --> 24:17.966
Go ahead.

24:18.560 --> 24:20.085
I'll be there before you know it.

24:26.680 --> 24:28.682
Here, head to the back, Sam.

24:30.480 --> 24:31.606
All right.

24:33.000 --> 24:34.081
All right.

24:34.760 --> 24:36.740
- Come here. Give me your backpack.
- Bear!

24:36.840 --> 24:38.060
- What?
- Cassie, I forgot Bear!

24:38.160 --> 24:39.700
- Cassie.
- What? Sam, what?

24:39.800 --> 24:41.500
- I forgot Bear! I need to go get him!
- Sam, stop. Sit down.

24:41.600 --> 24:44.410
- It's okay. What's up?
- I can't. I can't go without him.

24:45.000 --> 24:46.206
Please!

24:46.480 --> 24:48.860
All right, all right, all right, all right.
I'll go get him, okay?

24:48.960 --> 24:51.020
Just stay here. All right?

24:51.120 --> 24:52.610
- I'll be right back.
- Promise?

24:53.280 --> 24:55.681
Yeah, I'll be right back. I promise.

25:02.080 --> 25:03.100
Right, no, I think you're right.

25:03.200 --> 25:05.123
Just grab whatever you can get up
in a box and carry it.

25:06.280 --> 25:10.046
This way. Down to the mess hall.
In the mess hall now, please.

25:13.360 --> 25:14.566
Come on, Sam.

25:16.560 --> 25:19.006
Bear, Bear, Bear. Bear, Bear, Bear, Bear.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.082
God. Sam!

25:23.680 --> 25:24.761
Hey! Wait!

25:33.120 --> 25:34.281
Stop!

25:34.600 --> 25:35.940
Sam!

25:36.040 --> 25:38.140
Cassie! Wait, stop!

25:38.240 --> 25:40.049
Sam! No! Sam, wait!

25:40.400 --> 25:41.686
Sam!

25:41.960 --> 25:43.962
Cassie! Come on!

25:44.280 --> 25:45.281
Cassie!

25:45.800 --> 25:46.801
Sam!

25:47.320 --> 25:48.526
No!

25:48.920 --> 25:51.241
Cassie, no, no.

25:56.080 --> 25:57.081
No!

25:58.680 --> 25:59.806
No.

26:00.880 --> 26:02.086
Shi...

26:04.440 --> 26:06.363
Can I have your attention, please?

26:06.960 --> 26:08.644
If you'll all just quiet down.

26:11.040 --> 26:13.611
We believe the 4th Wave has begun.

26:16.320 --> 26:19.085
The Others have come down off their ship.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.928
They are moving among us.

26:22.240 --> 26:25.722
Apparently, they have the ability
to inhabit human hosts

26:26.120 --> 26:27.580
and control their actions.

26:27.680 --> 26:30.126
- So, they look like humans?
- That's correct.

26:30.400 --> 26:31.401
Where are they?

26:31.960 --> 26:33.644
They could be anywhere.

26:34.040 --> 26:36.441
What we do know is they have snipers
in these woods,

26:36.840 --> 26:38.740
and they are targeting survivors.

26:38.840 --> 26:40.260
We've got intel that would suggest

26:40.360 --> 26:43.091
some of them could be right here
in this very camp.

26:44.360 --> 26:48.340
So, what... Are you saying
that some of us are Others?

26:48.440 --> 26:50.660
Please. There's a lot we still don't know.

26:50.760 --> 26:52.444
We can detect them in children.

26:53.120 --> 26:56.780
Unfortunately, the screening procedure
for adults is a bit more complicated.

26:56.880 --> 26:58.020
What about our kids?

26:58.120 --> 26:59.300
Yeah, what about our kids?

26:59.400 --> 27:03.371
I know. I know you all wanna
get back to your families.

27:03.880 --> 27:07.407
Unfortunately, we're gonna have to
move you all to a secure holding facility

27:07.520 --> 27:09.620
so they can run some screening protocols.

27:09.720 --> 27:11.085
Folks, please!

27:12.240 --> 27:16.380
You need to understand, there is no way
to differentiate us from the Others

27:16.480 --> 27:18.820
without a comprehensive screening process.

27:18.920 --> 27:20.580
The sooner we get you screened,

27:20.680 --> 27:22.340
the sooner we can get you back
to your families.

27:22.440 --> 27:23.460
This is bullshit!

27:23.560 --> 27:26.140
I am not an Other, okay?
I'm not going anywhere.

27:26.240 --> 27:28.004
Sir, no one's saying that you are.

27:29.640 --> 27:31.290
This is the reality of our situation.

27:31.760 --> 27:34.331
Now if you'd just calm down.

27:35.360 --> 27:37.442
Please, just calm down.

27:39.280 --> 27:41.820
Let me out of here.
Get out of my way. Watch out.

27:41.920 --> 27:43.660
- Hold on, sir.
- Wait. Hey.

27:43.760 --> 27:45.780
- Back it up. Now.
- Stop right there.

27:45.880 --> 27:47.860
- Sir, drop your weapon.
- Step aside, now.

27:47.960 --> 27:49.405
- Sir, drop your weapon.
- Drew, no!

27:49.520 --> 27:50.820
You can't keep me in here!

27:50.920 --> 27:53.605
- Everybody, just calm down!
- Let me out now!

27:55.880 --> 27:56.927
Lower the weapon. Now.

27:59.000 --> 28:00.968
- I wanna see my kids!
- Put it down!

28:01.360 --> 28:02.420
Let me out of here!

28:02.520 --> 28:04.045
No! Drew, stop!

28:05.680 --> 28:06.806
Stay down!

28:07.120 --> 28:08.167
Run!

28:39.000 --> 28:40.843
No, no, no.

29:30.760 --> 29:31.761
Hey, Dad?

30:08.360 --> 30:09.691
Daddy.

30:14.760 --> 30:15.841
I'm sorry.

30:29.920 --> 30:31.251
I'm sorry.

31:03.640 --> 31:04.926
Daddy.

31:11.160 --> 31:12.764
I need my dad.

31:17.960 --> 31:18.961
God!

31:50.640 --> 31:57.205
Security teams,
clear zones three and four.

32:07.600 --> 32:14.484
Support team members,
meet arrivals on the tarmac.

32:26.000 --> 32:28.651
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

32:29.520 --> 32:31.860
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

32:31.960 --> 32:33.140
Number 127.

32:33.240 --> 32:36.961
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

32:39.280 --> 32:42.807
Stand in the red circle.
Wait for your number to be called.

32:43.680 --> 32:45.444
295.

32:46.120 --> 32:47.246
2-9-5.

32:49.160 --> 32:51.162
295.

32:51.720 --> 32:52.846
Here.

32:53.760 --> 32:56.570
Number 7-3, 73.

33:07.360 --> 33:09.567
Number 74.

33:09.920 --> 33:11.460
Number 130.

33:11.560 --> 33:12.641
194.

33:12.760 --> 33:14.046
1-3-0.

33:14.800 --> 33:17.326
1-9-4.

33:28.640 --> 33:30.100
What's your name?

33:30.200 --> 33:31.440
Ben Parish.

33:32.000 --> 33:34.082
They called me "Zombie" in quarantine.

33:35.800 --> 33:38.220
Any family not known to be dead?

33:38.320 --> 33:39.321
No.

33:40.000 --> 33:41.923
Sister died in the quakes.

33:42.400 --> 33:45.210
Mom and Dad killed by the virus.

33:45.840 --> 33:47.365
But it didn't kill you, did it?

33:48.680 --> 33:49.727
Not quite.

33:51.000 --> 33:53.002
That where the nickname came from?

33:56.200 --> 33:58.487
You fought it off.

34:00.680 --> 34:02.250
Yeah, lucky me.

34:06.560 --> 34:08.020
Is this your sister's?

34:08.120 --> 34:09.121
Yeah.

34:11.800 --> 34:13.404
Well, lucky you.

34:13.760 --> 34:15.967
You get to help avenge her death.

34:19.639 --> 34:22.530
This puts out a signal that we can track.

34:23.560 --> 34:27.281
You kids are the most important thing
right now.

34:27.880 --> 34:30.690
We need every one of you
to help us fight the Others.

34:31.159 --> 34:34.641
This isn't summer camp, Zombie.
You're a soldier now.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.567
So we don't wanna lose you. Stand up.

34:39.480 --> 34:40.811
Turn around.

34:43.920 --> 34:45.159
Take a deep breath.

34:50.480 --> 34:51.481
You all right?

34:55.159 --> 34:58.130
How are we supposed to fight the Others
if we don't even know what they are?

34:59.520 --> 35:01.090
Actually, we do.

35:03.120 --> 35:04.610
You wanna see one?

35:06.800 --> 35:09.690
Don't worry. He won't be able to see us.

35:22.880 --> 35:25.850
I know. It's impossible to tell.

35:28.520 --> 35:29.965
Look through here.

35:30.480 --> 35:31.527
Look.

35:47.520 --> 35:49.329
That's its true form.

35:50.800 --> 35:55.169
The Others infest real humans
like some sort of parasite.

35:55.720 --> 35:58.485
Take over their minds, their bodies.

35:59.120 --> 36:03.100
Drugs, radiation, surgery, nothing works.

36:03.200 --> 36:05.771
The only way to kill 'em
is to kill the host.

36:07.080 --> 36:08.764
He's already dead.

36:09.840 --> 36:12.844
You just need to
destroy the thing inside him.

36:17.760 --> 36:20.525
The thing that did this.

36:27.200 --> 36:28.611
Push the button.

36:34.800 --> 36:36.086
Look again!

36:38.800 --> 36:39.881
Look!

36:43.840 --> 36:45.940
If you're gonna be on my squad,

36:46.040 --> 36:49.442
I need to know that
you will do whatever it takes to...

36:59.240 --> 37:00.765
Welcome to the fight.

37:10.480 --> 37:12.642
Here's how you kill off a species.

37:13.440 --> 37:17.729
First, you take out the easy ones,
the weak, the exposed.

37:20.080 --> 37:22.686
Kill them as efficiently as possible.

37:24.360 --> 37:26.362
That was the first three Waves.

37:27.800 --> 37:31.441
But even if you bug bomb a house,
there's always a few cockroaches left.

37:32.560 --> 37:34.801
Now, we are like those cockroaches.

37:35.360 --> 37:37.647
And the Others are picking us off.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.051
One by one.

37:56.120 --> 37:58.566
And because the Others look like us,

37:59.040 --> 38:01.850
we can't trust anyone.

39:05.720 --> 39:07.768
Eighty miles to Wright-Patterson.

39:08.960 --> 39:10.540
I'm coming, Sammy

39:10.640 --> 39:11.641
I promise.

40:08.120 --> 40:09.780
How do you rid the world of humans?

40:09.880 --> 40:10.881
Help me.

40:16.480 --> 40:19.643
First, you rid the humans
of their humanity

42:06.840 --> 42:08.046
Shit.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.290
Shi... Shi...

42:41.280 --> 42:42.441
God!

42:45.920 --> 42:47.081
Sam.

42:47.640 --> 42:49.165
All right. All right.

43:24.200 --> 43:25.361
God!

43:30.360 --> 43:32.044
I'm sorry, Sam.

43:39.040 --> 43:41.725
When I was a child, I spoke as a child.

43:42.040 --> 43:44.884
I thought and I reasoned as a child.

43:46.160 --> 43:47.969
But when I became a man,

43:49.280 --> 43:50.850
I put away childish things.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.610
Those words never meant more to me
than they do right now,

43:56.040 --> 43:57.883
looking at all of you.

43:58.920 --> 44:01.048
Our hope. Our future.

44:02.400 --> 44:06.371
The best and brightest vision of who we are
and what we're fighting for.

44:08.920 --> 44:13.721
Our intelligence tells us the Others are
readying themselves for a final attack.

44:17.160 --> 44:18.400
The 5th Wave.

44:18.920 --> 44:21.969
What form it will take, we do not know.

44:23.560 --> 44:25.164
If they are successful,

44:26.160 --> 44:27.764
there will be no more Waves.

44:30.360 --> 44:31.930
No more conflicts.

44:32.360 --> 44:35.921
Humanity as we know it will be wiped
from the face of the Earth.

44:39.880 --> 44:40.881
Now.

44:41.600 --> 44:43.762
I'm gonna tell you some things I know.

44:46.880 --> 44:47.927
This is our world.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.610
It is our home.

44:51.680 --> 44:53.603
They will not overrun it.

44:54.480 --> 44:55.606
They will not possess it.

44:58.280 --> 45:00.282
So with whatever time we have left,

45:02.040 --> 45:06.523
you will learn to think, speak,
move and fight like the soldiers you are.

45:06.640 --> 45:07.971
Look out! A raid!

45:08.480 --> 45:09.686
Go!

45:11.120 --> 45:12.201
Fire!

45:12.520 --> 45:14.488
Let the weight of our loss fuel you.

45:15.240 --> 45:17.660
Let the weight of our dead embolden you.

45:17.760 --> 45:19.091
Your right! On your right!

45:19.640 --> 45:22.803
Let the weight of our hope
drive you to victory.

45:24.400 --> 45:25.481
Can you do that?

45:28.880 --> 45:30.120
All right. Hold!

45:30.640 --> 45:32.660
Soldiers! Can you do that?

45:32.760 --> 45:34.171
Sir, yes, sir!

45:37.080 --> 45:38.100
Zombie!

45:38.200 --> 45:39.611
- Get down!
- It's a booby trap!

45:41.280 --> 45:42.460
Can you do that?

45:42.560 --> 45:44.244
Sir, yes, sir!

45:49.080 --> 45:50.081
Good.

47:51.600 --> 47:52.886
Come on.

47:53.400 --> 47:55.660
Where's my gun? Where's my gun?

47:55.760 --> 47:56.966
Where is it?

48:24.800 --> 48:26.325
I know you're awake.

48:32.600 --> 48:33.681
Cassie?

48:36.320 --> 48:38.322
How the hell do you know my name?

48:38.760 --> 48:39.841
Your driver's licence.

48:40.840 --> 48:42.126
I'm Evan.

48:42.720 --> 48:43.801
Evan Walker.

48:45.640 --> 48:46.641
Where am I?

48:47.360 --> 48:51.580
You were bleeding on the highway.
I brought you back here to my house.

48:51.680 --> 48:52.920
Where's my gun?

48:53.680 --> 48:56.047
All right, when you found me on
the highway, I had my gun. Where is it?

48:56.360 --> 48:58.203
I didn't see any gun.

49:03.560 --> 49:04.766
What did you do?

49:05.240 --> 49:06.340
Your leg, Cassie.

49:06.440 --> 49:08.380
- Don't touch me! Don't touch me! Don't...
- Your leg.

49:08.480 --> 49:09.686
Jesus.

49:16.160 --> 49:17.366
God.

49:23.920 --> 49:25.445
Put your leg over here.

49:28.240 --> 49:31.050
- This is gonna hurt.
- All right. Just do it. Just do it.

49:32.960 --> 49:34.041
God.

49:40.360 --> 49:41.521
Okay.

49:51.720 --> 49:52.767
God.

49:54.960 --> 49:56.371
How long have I been here?

49:57.040 --> 49:58.041
About a week.

49:59.160 --> 50:00.161
God.

50:01.760 --> 50:03.603
How far is Wright-Patterson from here?

50:05.080 --> 50:06.730
The military base?

50:07.800 --> 50:09.370
About 60 miles.

50:09.800 --> 50:10.926
Why?

50:18.520 --> 50:19.646
Jesus!

50:29.200 --> 50:30.929
Hey. It's okay.

50:31.560 --> 50:33.500
- You're safe here.
- No.

50:33.600 --> 50:36.604
All right, we're not safe
anywhere any more.

50:37.200 --> 50:40.921
Why did you wanna know
how close Wright-Patterson was?

50:44.080 --> 50:45.081
It's my brother.

50:45.520 --> 50:47.170
The Army took him there, so I...

50:48.960 --> 50:50.086
I need to get him back.

50:53.200 --> 50:54.201
What?

50:55.080 --> 50:56.366
You should eat.

50:58.200 --> 51:00.043
You gotta get your strength back.

51:02.200 --> 51:04.328
Why'd you bring me here?

51:05.680 --> 51:07.284
What do you want?

51:08.400 --> 51:09.811
My family.

51:10.760 --> 51:12.410
I couldn't save them,

51:14.840 --> 51:16.410
but I could save you.

51:19.480 --> 51:22.484
The way everything's happened,
I guess it just makes me feel more...

51:25.320 --> 51:26.651
Human.

51:29.320 --> 51:31.243
And you need help with that?

51:33.120 --> 51:34.565
Feeling human?

51:36.040 --> 51:37.326
Don't you?

51:42.320 --> 51:43.526
Maybe.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.900
- You're cheating.
- I'm not cheating.

52:04.000 --> 52:05.525
Don't you tell him my card.

52:05.640 --> 52:07.051
You hear me, Oompa?

52:08.360 --> 52:11.728
Hey, I've been getting pretty lucky,
and this isn't my first time playing.

52:12.040 --> 52:14.780
By the way, I heard the new guy coming in
got kicked out of their last squad.

52:14.880 --> 52:17.042
- For what?
- Disciplinary issues.

52:18.880 --> 52:20.245
That true, boss?

52:21.560 --> 52:22.700
That's what they say.

52:22.800 --> 52:23.860
What's his name?

52:23.960 --> 52:25.405
The name's Ringer.

52:27.960 --> 52:30.281
And he is a she.

52:32.400 --> 52:33.925
Bunk's over there.

52:38.400 --> 52:40.260
Did you ever do karate before?

52:40.360 --> 52:41.407
No.

52:42.480 --> 52:43.811
Sure looks like you did.

52:51.760 --> 52:52.761
You Zombie?

52:53.920 --> 52:54.921
Yeah.

52:55.440 --> 52:57.488
I was the leader of my last squad.

52:59.720 --> 53:00.926
No doubt.

53:01.960 --> 53:04.964
So the guy I replace went Section 8. Why?

53:10.760 --> 53:11.820
Does it matter?

53:11.920 --> 53:13.380
I heard it's 'cause this squad's so bad

53:13.480 --> 53:15.767
he was afraid you'd get him killed
when the 5th Wave hits.

53:18.520 --> 53:20.010
It's your squad, too, now.

53:23.760 --> 53:24.807
Hey!

53:25.480 --> 53:27.403
Keep staring at my ass

53:27.960 --> 53:29.405
and I'll rip your throats out.

53:32.280 --> 53:33.700
Let's be clear.

53:33.800 --> 53:37.486
I'm not taking orders from you.
I'm not gonna die with you geniuses.

53:38.240 --> 53:39.605
Good to know.

53:43.640 --> 53:46.883
If anyone in this barrack touches me,
I'll kill them.

53:47.760 --> 53:48.761
Got it?

53:55.120 --> 53:56.121
Anything else?

53:56.640 --> 53:59.371
I like to play chess. Do you play?

54:00.000 --> 54:01.240
No, actually.

54:03.680 --> 54:05.205
But if you wanna play
some strip poker later on...

54:06.160 --> 54:07.366
Shit!

54:07.720 --> 54:10.326
And no demeaning, sexist remarks.

54:15.520 --> 54:16.601
She's cool.

56:45.760 --> 56:46.761
Quiet.

57:17.640 --> 57:19.860
You had my gun the whole time!
Why'd you lie?

57:19.960 --> 57:21.928
I was afraid you'd shoot me.

57:22.360 --> 57:24.420
For all I knew, you were an Other.

57:24.520 --> 57:25.760
Yeah, well...

57:34.800 --> 57:37.620
Was he one? Out there?

57:37.720 --> 57:38.721
Yeah.

57:40.120 --> 57:41.690
The woods are full of 'em.

57:42.080 --> 57:44.765
They're using those drones
to hunt down survivors.

57:49.120 --> 57:50.963
He looked so human that...

57:53.880 --> 57:55.460
God. I gotta get Sam.

57:55.560 --> 57:56.561
Cassie.

57:57.760 --> 58:01.401
Rallying points,
places like Wright-Patterson,

58:04.240 --> 58:05.890
they're obvious targets.

58:14.280 --> 58:16.567
You think that Sammy's already dead?

58:23.920 --> 58:25.763
I'm sorry, Cassie.

58:35.440 --> 58:37.220
You're wrong, Evan.

58:37.320 --> 58:38.810
All right? He's alive.

58:40.200 --> 58:43.044
He's alive, and I'm gonna go get him.

58:55.000 --> 58:56.161
Cassie.

58:58.800 --> 59:00.290
I'm going with you.

59:05.280 --> 59:07.681
You're not gonna make it very far
on your own.

59:08.640 --> 59:10.220
You know what? Screw you, Evan.

59:10.320 --> 59:12.288
- Okay? I don't need you. I don't need anyone.
- Cassie, come on.

59:12.400 --> 59:13.580
- If you go, I'll just follow you.
- Actually, no.

59:13.680 --> 59:15.205
If I need someone
to carve a cane for me...

59:15.320 --> 59:17.500
You can't stop me.
How are you gonna stop me?

59:17.600 --> 59:18.860
I don't know. Maybe I'll shoot you!

59:18.960 --> 59:21.042
What, like you shot that guy
with the crucifix?

59:24.960 --> 59:26.530
What, you read my journal?

59:27.800 --> 59:30.451
- I didn't think you were gonna live.
- Don't touch me!

59:33.720 --> 59:34.846
I'm sorry.

59:36.760 --> 59:38.250
I'll get you there.

59:39.160 --> 59:42.687
I can't promise what you'll find,
but I will get you there.

59:44.760 --> 59:46.205
We leave in the morning.

59:49.000 --> 59:50.684
This is a waste of time.

59:52.560 --> 59:53.580
Go ahead and try it again.

59:53.680 --> 59:56.700
Those kids are gonna be dead
before their boots hit the ground.

59:56.800 --> 59:59.420
Especially with you as squad leader.

59:59.520 --> 01:00:01.124
You don't know anything about me.

01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:05.124
Let me guess.

01:00:07.840 --> 01:00:11.100
You did good in school,
had a bunch of friends.

01:00:11.200 --> 01:00:12.500
You probably played football.

01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:15.046
You might have even been team captain.

01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.725
Life was easy.

01:00:18.680 --> 01:00:20.648
And then, all of a sudden, it wasn't.

01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:23.803
No more games to win.

01:00:24.520 --> 01:00:27.490
No one to get weak-kneed
at that pretty smile.

01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:30.404
You weren't ready for the end of world.

01:00:31.720 --> 01:00:32.846
And you were?

01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:35.450
I know how to survive.

01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.100
And I was doing fine out there on my own.

01:00:39.200 --> 01:00:41.300
Till they forced me
onto their stupid school bus.

01:00:41.400 --> 01:00:42.980
They were rescuing us.

01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:45.924
We didn't get rescued, dumbass.
We got drafted.

01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:48.126
Good, good.

01:00:48.560 --> 01:00:49.721
Try it again.

01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:04.820
How about this?

01:01:04.920 --> 01:01:06.524
I take you down,

01:01:07.640 --> 01:01:08.880
you teach us how to shoot.

01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:10.521
And when you don't?

01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:12.846
I stop asking.

01:01:13.200 --> 01:01:14.201
Deal.

01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.900
Cute necklace. Girlfriend or sister?

01:01:19.000 --> 01:01:20.001
Sister.

01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:25.761
You're too sentimental.

01:01:52.120 --> 01:01:56.125
Can you teach me that thing
where you took the gun out of my hand?

01:01:58.800 --> 01:02:02.380
Let's just leave
any potential disarming to me,

01:02:02.480 --> 01:02:03.420
- all right?
- No.

01:02:03.520 --> 01:02:05.284
No, I need to be ready.

01:02:05.800 --> 01:02:07.564
Cassie, it's okay.

01:02:08.160 --> 01:02:10.380
You don't have to be tough all the time.

01:02:10.480 --> 01:02:12.642
Don't do that.

01:02:14.080 --> 01:02:15.809
I'm not tough, okay?

01:02:18.120 --> 01:02:21.806
I promised Sam that I would be there
for him no matter what.

01:02:24.800 --> 01:02:26.802
I made that promise to him.

01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:31.847
Okay.

01:02:33.920 --> 01:02:35.126
Give me your gun.

01:02:45.480 --> 01:02:46.527
Get up.

01:02:50.360 --> 01:02:51.691
Point it at my chest.

01:02:54.680 --> 01:02:57.100
Okay. Grab the barrel of the gun
with your left,

01:02:57.200 --> 01:02:59.601
and with your right, snap my hand away.

01:03:00.160 --> 01:03:01.161
You got it?

01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.340
Hey, you're not gonna hurt me. All right.

01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:10.204
Like that, but stronger.

01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:12.487
Good.

01:03:14.200 --> 01:03:17.488
Now at the end, you'll grab my wrist
and pull it toward you.

01:03:23.480 --> 01:03:25.130
- Like that?
- Yeah.

01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:26.886
Good job.

01:03:27.800 --> 01:03:29.131
Well, thanks.

01:03:34.720 --> 01:03:36.085
Can I have...

01:03:48.920 --> 01:03:51.571
Okay. Don't be so scared of your weapon.

01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:55.648
You gotta think that the gun
is a part of you.

01:03:56.880 --> 01:03:59.008
Not the gun firing, you firing.

01:04:01.440 --> 01:04:02.601
Try it again.

01:04:29.280 --> 01:04:31.282
Well, that wasn't terrible.

01:04:34.200 --> 01:04:36.771
Zombie, the Colonel wants to see you, now.

01:04:45.640 --> 01:04:47.529
Could be. Seems like a good target.

01:04:48.640 --> 01:04:49.801
Be right back.

01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:52.490
- Lieutenant?
- Yes, sir.

01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.883
Simultaneous attacks
on the last of our metropolitan areas.

01:05:02.480 --> 01:05:05.006
A full-on invasion. This is it.

01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.766
The 5th Wave.

01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:09.480
It's started?

01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:12.001
Yeah.

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:14.284
Here, I want to show you something.

01:05:16.320 --> 01:05:19.403
These employ the same technology
as the detector viewer from medical.

01:05:20.040 --> 01:05:21.565
We've improved it. Made it mobile.

01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:23.700
The idea is to allow
our soldiers in the field

01:05:23.800 --> 01:05:26.167
to instantly differentiate
between friend and foe.

01:05:27.360 --> 01:05:30.204
You look at the enemy through this
and it lights 'em up green.

01:05:31.160 --> 01:05:33.162
We can see them
before they know they've been seen.

01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:35.009
We take back the advantage.

01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:39.607
The only thing left to do now is
test the optics in live conditions.

01:05:40.320 --> 01:05:41.780
Which is why tomorrow at 2100,

01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:44.360
I'm sending four squads
into battle equipped with these helmets.

01:05:46.040 --> 01:05:47.610
Your squad will be among those four.

01:05:49.360 --> 01:05:50.380
Yes, sir.

01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.164
Make me proud, son.

01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.961
Bring that squad back in one piece.

01:05:56.280 --> 01:05:57.406
Yes, sir.

01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.401
Evan?

01:07:05.520 --> 01:07:07.363
- Morning.
- Morning.

01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.405
Who've we got here?

01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.740
This is Lizbeth.

01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:22.649
She's my best friend.

01:07:23.840 --> 01:07:25.968
She looks like she's funny.

01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:31.088
Yeah. Actually, you know, she was...

01:07:31.800 --> 01:07:33.484
She was really funny.

01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.900
- And this guy.
- He's nobody.

01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:39.889
This must be Ben Parish.

01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:44.600
God.

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:48.604
I really wish you hadn't read my journal.

01:07:49.560 --> 01:07:51.324
It's really embarrassing.

01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:55.850
Is that your family?

01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:57.566
Yeah.

01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:03.685
And that must be Sam.

01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:05.281
Yeah.

01:08:07.600 --> 01:08:10.171
I can't wait to meet him.

01:08:16.680 --> 01:08:18.603
- We should probably get moving.
- Yeah.

01:08:31.120 --> 01:08:32.451
All right, this way.

01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:35.420
How do you know without a compass?

01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:36.567
Do you have a compass?

01:08:36.880 --> 01:08:38.644
No. But...

01:08:40.359 --> 01:08:43.648
You know, I can make one out of a pin
and a glass of water.

01:08:46.359 --> 01:08:48.044
Didn't peg you for a Girl Scout.

01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:49.890
What'd you peg me as?

01:08:50.640 --> 01:08:51.620
A cheerleader?

01:08:51.720 --> 01:08:53.323
You said it, not me.

01:08:54.399 --> 01:08:57.140
I've never been a huge fan
of the outdoors.

01:08:57.240 --> 01:08:58.779
Too many bugs.

01:08:58.880 --> 01:09:00.700
You live on a farm.

01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:02.006
Accident of birth.

01:09:02.720 --> 01:09:05.371
I had a scholarship to Kent State.

01:09:05.920 --> 01:09:07.604
Mechanical engineering.

01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.404
Thought I was some hick, huh?

01:09:10.640 --> 01:09:12.881
You said it, not me.

01:09:48.800 --> 01:09:51.660
Zombie, are they really
sending us to fight?

01:09:51.760 --> 01:09:52.761
Yeah.

01:09:53.439 --> 01:09:54.601
I'm scared.

01:09:55.320 --> 01:09:56.606
It's okay.

01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.164
Just go to sleep, all right?

01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:04.328
What was your name before?

01:10:09.680 --> 01:10:10.806
Ben.

01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.246
What was yours?

01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:16.040
Sam.

01:10:16.840 --> 01:10:18.968
But my sister called me Sams.

01:10:19.640 --> 01:10:21.563
When I couldn't sleep

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:25.122
she would sing to me.

01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.100
Bones sinking like stones

01:10:30.200 --> 01:10:33.204
All that we fought for

01:10:34.680 --> 01:10:37.540
Homes, places we've grown

01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:40.220
All of us are done for

01:10:40.320 --> 01:10:41.890
Could you guys please shut up?

01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.403
We live in a beautiful world

01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:50.288
Yeah, we do, yeah, we do

01:10:50.720 --> 01:10:54.406
We live in a beautiful world

01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.685
Hey. Let me help you.

01:11:15.280 --> 01:11:16.850
Yeah, sure.

01:11:19.480 --> 01:11:21.209
- Looks better.
- Yeah.

01:11:28.880 --> 01:11:31.121
- Let me do this.
- All right.

01:11:38.800 --> 01:11:40.962
- Got scissors?
- Yeah.

01:11:41.720 --> 01:11:43.051
I got it.

01:12:02.440 --> 01:12:04.363
- I should probably cover our stuff.
- Evan.

01:12:13.040 --> 01:12:14.405
Thank you.

01:12:47.480 --> 01:12:49.780
- Squad 53?
- Present and accounted for.

01:12:49.880 --> 01:12:50.900
All right.

01:12:51.000 --> 01:12:52.570
Strap in. Take us up.

01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:55.487
Where's Nugget?

01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.045
Food poisoning.

01:12:59.440 --> 01:13:00.646
Zombie.

01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:03.281
Zombie.

01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.450
Let me out of here!

01:13:21.240 --> 01:13:23.288
Copy that.
Tango Three dropping down 1,000.

01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:33.260
You clear on your orders?

01:13:33.360 --> 01:13:36.682
Infiltrate enemy hornet's nest,
verify enemy and terminate.

01:13:37.040 --> 01:13:40.601
Remember, the Others light up green
in your visors.

01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:43.540
At mission complete,
signal for extraction.

01:13:43.640 --> 01:13:44.926
We'll get ya home.

01:14:54.920 --> 01:14:58.208
Holy shit, it's working.
You guys, I got two of 'em straight ahead.

01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.140
And I heard it. I was right there.

01:15:02.240 --> 01:15:03.287
Got you, you motherf...

01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.164
I peed. I definitely just peed.

01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:08.727
Get inside!

01:15:09.600 --> 01:15:10.886
Return fire!

01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:18.291
Coming this way!

01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:22.762
- They're over here, too!
- Run for the alley!

01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.140
Go! Go, go, go!

01:15:25.240 --> 01:15:27.288
- Teacup, go, go!
- Go! Run!

01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:29.126
Move!

01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:32.565
Go! Go!

01:15:33.600 --> 01:15:34.931
Contact!

01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:37.806
Stay low!

01:15:41.520 --> 01:15:42.646
Get to the bus.

01:15:44.920 --> 01:15:45.967
Go!

01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:14.047
Where's Teacup?

01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:17.487
- Where's Teacup? We lost Teacup.
- Over here!

01:16:18.360 --> 01:16:20.328
Don't do that! Don't scare me like that!

01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:22.620
Oompa's been shot!

01:16:22.720 --> 01:16:24.820
Down, down! Now, now! Down, down, down!

01:16:24.920 --> 01:16:26.100
Oompa's been shot!

01:16:26.200 --> 01:16:27.540
Down!

01:16:27.640 --> 01:16:28.687
He's not breathing!

01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.940
Don't be dead. Come on, man.

01:16:35.040 --> 01:16:36.530
Don't be dead! Please don't be dead!

01:16:37.280 --> 01:16:39.009
Oompa... Stay alive, Oompa!

01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:42.371
We can't stay here. They'll be back.

01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:47.580
That alleyway. We'll have cover there.

01:16:47.680 --> 01:16:48.700
No, it's too far.

01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:51.220
If we're out in the open that long
they'll pick us off one by one.

01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:52.321
We need a distraction.

01:16:54.440 --> 01:16:56.044
- Okay.
- Okay what?

01:16:56.160 --> 01:16:57.340
I'll distract them.

01:16:57.440 --> 01:16:59.647
When I tell you to run,
run as fast as you can.

01:16:59.760 --> 01:17:01.364
- Now cover me!
- What?

01:17:17.360 --> 01:17:18.300
Listen up!

01:17:18.400 --> 01:17:20.562
On my go, haul ass to the alleyway.

01:17:22.920 --> 01:17:25.400
Back out there? Are you crazy?

01:17:27.560 --> 01:17:29.780
Listen, Teacup,
you just gotta trust me, okay?

01:17:29.880 --> 01:17:31.450
You're gonna run and don't look back.

01:17:32.960 --> 01:17:35.361
- What about Oompa?
- He's dead, man. We gotta leave him.

01:17:37.360 --> 01:17:39.283
Sorry, man. I'm sorry.

01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:41.780
- Zombie, now! Run!
- Haul ass!

01:17:41.880 --> 01:17:44.042
- Go, go, go!
- Let's move! Move! Move!

01:18:22.480 --> 01:18:23.970
- Stairs.
- Got it.

01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:27.246
Clear!

01:18:28.280 --> 01:18:29.406
Clear!

01:18:29.800 --> 01:18:30.926
Clear!

01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:34.620
Are we still alive?

01:18:34.720 --> 01:18:35.960
I think so.

01:18:38.760 --> 01:18:39.761
Watch out!

01:18:40.440 --> 01:18:42.020
Don't shoot! It's Ringer!

01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:43.580
That was badass, Ringer.

01:18:43.680 --> 01:18:46.365
I'd hug you if I didn't think
you'd punch me in the nuts for it.

01:18:49.160 --> 01:18:50.685
Okay, so what do we do now?

01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:53.481
None of this makes sense.

01:18:55.160 --> 01:18:57.220
They knock planes out of the sky
and cause earthquakes,

01:18:57.320 --> 01:18:59.004
but they're afraid of an army of children?

01:18:59.760 --> 01:19:02.047
There's something Vosch isn't telling us.

01:19:03.000 --> 01:19:05.321
Okay, I'm not risking my life for this.

01:19:05.960 --> 01:19:07.260
Ringer, what are you doing?

01:19:07.360 --> 01:19:08.771
I'm unenlisting.

01:19:09.240 --> 01:19:10.780
I'm better out there on my own.

01:19:10.880 --> 01:19:13.060
If you know what's best for you,
you'll do the same.

01:19:13.160 --> 01:19:15.220
- Holy shit! What the hell is this?
- Zombie, you see this?

01:19:15.320 --> 01:19:16.481
- She's green!
- What the hell, you guys?

01:19:17.160 --> 01:19:18.161
Put your guns down.

01:19:19.480 --> 01:19:21.380
You're one of them! You're an alien!

01:19:21.480 --> 01:19:23.460
What are you talking about?
I just saved your asses!

01:19:23.560 --> 01:19:25.260
If she's one of them,
we have to take her out now.

01:19:25.360 --> 01:19:26.420
Poundcake, just calm down, all right?

01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:27.681
- We have to.
- I can see it!

01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:29.571
I can see it inside of her!

01:19:29.960 --> 01:19:32.100
- There's nothing inside me!
- Shut up!

01:19:32.200 --> 01:19:34.441
- Zombie, what do we do? Do we shoot her?
- It's your call, Zombie.

01:19:41.920 --> 01:19:42.921
Zombie, what are you doing?

01:19:56.040 --> 01:19:57.041
What's up, man?

01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:00.460
- Oh, my God! What's going on, man?
- Come on, man.

01:20:00.560 --> 01:20:02.060
Hey. Put your guns down.
Put your guns down.

01:20:02.160 --> 01:20:05.020
Don't shoot. Calm down.
She's not an Other. Neither am I.

01:20:05.120 --> 01:20:06.780
- I'm glowing green, right?
- Yeah.

01:20:06.880 --> 01:20:08.882
Yeah. Yeah, listen.

01:20:09.920 --> 01:20:11.046
You know me.

01:20:11.400 --> 01:20:12.780
Come on, Dumbo. You know who I am.

01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:14.211
Put the guns down.

01:20:14.720 --> 01:20:16.660
Just put 'em down! I'm not an Other.

01:20:16.760 --> 01:20:19.604
I don't even think any of those people
out there shooting at us are Others.

01:20:19.720 --> 01:20:21.529
Reznik, Vosch...

01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:23.486
They lied to us.

01:20:24.200 --> 01:20:25.725
They lied to us, man.

01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:28.802
Green doesn't mean alien.
Green means human.

01:20:29.560 --> 01:20:30.925
Just, without one of these.

01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:32.971
What are you talking about?

01:20:33.080 --> 01:20:34.140
Don't you guys see?

01:20:34.240 --> 01:20:38.020
Those lenses, these trackers,
it's all fake, man.

01:20:38.120 --> 01:20:39.963
It's an illusion. It's a trick.

01:20:40.400 --> 01:20:42.260
They weren't testing these.
They were testing us.

01:20:42.360 --> 01:20:45.409
They were seeing how we would do,
how we would hold up under pressure.

01:20:45.920 --> 01:20:47.940
All right? If we would do
what we were trained to do.

01:20:48.040 --> 01:20:50.930
- To kill Others!
- No, to kill the survivors, man!

01:20:52.400 --> 01:20:53.606
To kill survivors.

01:20:55.280 --> 01:20:57.860
Yeah, well, what about the guys outside,
the ones that were shooting at us?

01:20:57.960 --> 01:20:59.020
They're human.

01:20:59.120 --> 01:21:01.168
Why would the Army want us
to kill other humans?

01:21:02.080 --> 01:21:04.447
Because the Army, Reznik, Vosch,

01:21:04.920 --> 01:21:06.410
they're the Others.

01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:08.180
And because we're kids,

01:21:08.280 --> 01:21:11.329
they thought they could manipulate us
into doing their dirty work.

01:21:12.320 --> 01:21:14.049
We're not fighting the 5th Wave.

01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:17.130
We are the 5th Wave.

01:21:20.800 --> 01:21:21.961
God.

01:21:23.320 --> 01:21:24.446
So...

01:21:25.080 --> 01:21:26.241
What do we do?

01:21:28.680 --> 01:21:29.806
Take out your trackers.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.420
We go AWOL.

01:21:33.520 --> 01:21:35.363
This means we can't go back.
You know that, right?

01:21:38.640 --> 01:21:39.801
Nugget.

01:21:40.320 --> 01:21:41.810
I left him back at the base.

01:21:44.320 --> 01:21:46.980
- I was trying to protect him.
- Jeez.

01:21:47.080 --> 01:21:49.100
- I gotta go back.
- That's suicide, dude.

01:21:49.200 --> 01:21:51.420
- No, man. I gotta go back.
- You can't just wander back in there.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:53.045
- They'll know.
- I can't leave him there!

01:21:53.280 --> 01:21:55.060
I'll put the tracker back in.
They'll pick me up.

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.100
You guys go ahead.
I will meet up with you later.

01:21:57.200 --> 01:22:00.329
Dumbo, where can I take a bullet
in the torso and not die?

01:22:03.360 --> 01:22:05.169
- Are you serious?
- I'm not kidding, man.

01:22:05.280 --> 01:22:07.780
Where can I take a bullet in the torso?
I gotta make it look real.

01:22:07.880 --> 01:22:09.245
It's the only way
I'm getting back in alive.

01:22:09.360 --> 01:22:11.700
It's impossible, man.
There's too many organs.

01:22:11.800 --> 01:22:12.940
There's gotta be somewhere, man.

01:22:13.040 --> 01:22:15.860
Ringer, she can make the shot, all right?
I know she can.

01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:17.140
You want me to shoot you?

01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.844
Don't pretend like
you haven't thought about it.

01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.366
Where do you want me to shoot him?

01:22:23.360 --> 01:22:25.362
I mean, the... Shit.

01:23:00.000 --> 01:23:01.286
Evan Walker.

01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:04.563
You're out of your drone sector.

01:23:05.560 --> 01:23:06.620
Hey.

01:23:06.720 --> 01:23:08.722
Put the gun down. Stay away.

01:23:26.400 --> 01:23:27.811
Cassie, run!

01:23:28.760 --> 01:23:30.046
Where's my gun?

01:23:43.280 --> 01:23:44.406
Evan.

01:25:05.680 --> 01:25:07.091
Drop the gun.

01:25:07.680 --> 01:25:09.205
Evan, drop it.

01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:14.244
If I was gonna kill you, Cassie,
I would've done it a long time ago.

01:25:15.000 --> 01:25:16.365
What are you?

01:25:18.960 --> 01:25:20.900
You're one of them.
You're a fucking Other.

01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:22.047
I'm human.

01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:26.131
But I'm Other, too.

01:25:26.840 --> 01:25:27.841
I'm both.

01:25:30.040 --> 01:25:32.566
This isn't the first time
the Others have been here.

01:25:33.160 --> 01:25:36.289
They came before
and created sleeper agents, like me.

01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:39.883
I always felt different.

01:25:41.160 --> 01:25:44.084
Growing up, there was
this voice in my head.

01:25:44.200 --> 01:25:46.441
It was quiet, but it was there.

01:25:47.040 --> 01:25:48.610
And when the ship arrived,

01:25:50.120 --> 01:25:53.203
it was like a switch
was flipped inside me,

01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:55.644
and the sleeper woke up.

01:25:56.960 --> 01:25:58.371
How many people have you killed?

01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:07.370
Did you kill your family?

01:26:08.040 --> 01:26:09.180
No.

01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:10.300
The disease...

01:26:10.400 --> 01:26:14.564
The disease that the Others created.
The disease that you created.

01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:17.324
Your family loved you.

01:26:17.440 --> 01:26:20.364
Our kind believe
that love is just a trick.

01:26:21.760 --> 01:26:22.980
An instinct.

01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:25.208
A way to protect your genetic future.

01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.286
Do you really believe that?

01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:33.921
I did.

01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:38.770
But then I saw you.

01:27:09.480 --> 01:27:10.606
I don't know how

01:27:10.920 --> 01:27:13.207
I don't understand it, but...

01:27:14.320 --> 01:27:16.322
It was like you flipped the switch back.

01:27:17.640 --> 01:27:19.608
You made me wanna be human again.

01:27:21.520 --> 01:27:22.760
Did you shoot me?

01:27:23.200 --> 01:27:24.326
No.

01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:26.806
I saved you.

01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:07.085
I was wrong.

01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:08.980
They're wrong.

01:28:09.080 --> 01:28:11.162
Love's not a trick. It's real.

01:28:12.360 --> 01:28:15.250
I know now because of you.

01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:18.090
Look, stay back!

01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.887
I don't wanna hear any more.

01:28:21.600 --> 01:28:23.011
Just stay there.

01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:33.848
Cassie, please, just let me help you.

01:28:36.080 --> 01:28:38.367
All I wanna do is help you find Sam.

01:28:41.400 --> 01:28:42.925
All right. Get on your knees, Evan.

01:28:44.240 --> 01:28:46.561
All right.
Come on, just get on your knees.

01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:53.886
Listen.

01:28:54.440 --> 01:28:56.727
The Army is controlled by the Others.

01:28:58.240 --> 01:29:00.004
They're preparing the kids.

01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.001
For what?

01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:07.004
To kill the last humans.

01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:17.810
They'll search you.

01:29:18.720 --> 01:29:20.290
You can't be armed.

01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:25.084
If you follow me,

01:29:26.000 --> 01:29:27.490
I'll shoot you.

01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.860
Soldier, where's your unit?

01:29:48.960 --> 01:29:50.060
All dead!

01:29:50.160 --> 01:29:51.161
What's your number?

01:29:51.280 --> 01:29:52.645
2-9-5!

01:29:57.360 --> 01:29:59.601
2-9-5. He'll live.

01:30:00.040 --> 01:30:01.500
Let's bug out!

01:30:01.600 --> 01:30:03.380
All right, copy that, Tango Three.

01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:05.369
Tango Three returning to base!

01:30:05.760 --> 01:30:07.500
2-9-5 on deck!

01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:10.126
The rest of the squad are reported KIA.

01:30:26.800 --> 01:30:29.371
Ma'am, it's all right. It's all right.
We've got you.

01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:33.326
5-4-7!

01:30:34.560 --> 01:30:36.688
547!

01:30:40.960 --> 01:30:43.247
Any family not known to be dead?

01:30:43.680 --> 01:30:45.250
No, just me.

01:30:46.200 --> 01:30:47.361
Stand up.

01:30:53.320 --> 01:30:55.368
You know why you're here, Cassie?

01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:02.010
To get revenge.

01:31:07.920 --> 01:31:08.921
He's an Other.

01:31:11.920 --> 01:31:13.206
I know.

01:31:13.920 --> 01:31:15.763
It's impossible to tell.

01:31:20.520 --> 01:31:21.885
Look through here.

01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.243
That's its true form.

01:31:27.600 --> 01:31:29.045
That's the face it's hiding.

01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:42.050
What happened out there?

01:32:42.160 --> 01:32:43.491
It was bad, sir.

01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:46.165
We were surrounded.

01:32:47.160 --> 01:32:50.004
We tried to move to cover,
but as soon as we did...

01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:53.250
They were everywhere, sir.

01:32:54.600 --> 01:32:56.090
- Everyone was hit.
- Except you.

01:33:01.840 --> 01:33:02.860
I took a bullet, sir.

01:33:02.960 --> 01:33:04.291
But you survived.

01:33:05.960 --> 01:33:07.291
It's a miracle,

01:33:08.080 --> 01:33:11.129
the way that bullet went right through you
and managed to

01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:13.125
miss everything important.

01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.850
Let's make a deal.

01:33:19.080 --> 01:33:21.731
You drop your lie, and I'll drop mine.

01:33:28.880 --> 01:33:30.370
Tell me, Ben.

01:33:31.440 --> 01:33:32.680
What do you know?

01:33:34.600 --> 01:33:36.364
I know what you are.

01:33:47.960 --> 01:33:49.260
You're gonna kill me, aren't you?

01:33:49.360 --> 01:33:50.566
Yes.

01:33:52.360 --> 01:33:53.521
Why?

01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:56.129
What's the point of any of this?

01:33:56.640 --> 01:33:58.881
- What did we do to deserve...
- Nothing.

01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.887
Other than occupy a space we need.

01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:13.980
We're not that different, Ben.
Your kind would do exactly the same thing.

01:34:14.080 --> 01:34:15.081
No.

01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:20.401
Our kind wouldn't have
wiped out an entire species.

01:34:20.720 --> 01:34:22.300
Of course you would.

01:34:22.400 --> 01:34:23.811
You've been doing it for centuries.

01:34:28.080 --> 01:34:30.367
Sir, Sergeant Reznik's dead.

01:34:30.680 --> 01:34:31.980
Security found her body.

01:34:32.080 --> 01:34:33.127
- Where?
- In medical.

01:34:33.400 --> 01:34:35.801
There's more. Three guards were killed
at the west gate and...

01:34:38.080 --> 01:34:39.140
What the hell was that?

01:34:39.240 --> 01:34:41.242
An explosion, sir.
It came from inside the base.

01:34:41.360 --> 01:34:43.488
- Get rid of him.
- Damage to Sector Three!

01:34:43.760 --> 01:34:44.820
- Captain.
- Let's go.

01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:49.180
We need to move all the recruits off-base.
Get 'em on planes to Wonderland now.

01:34:49.280 --> 01:34:51.282
Deploy units. Find out who's attacking us.

01:35:18.280 --> 01:35:20.408
South corridor! On the double!

01:35:30.120 --> 01:35:32.487
They're taking out our security cameras.

01:35:33.120 --> 01:35:35.771
Bring the drones home
so we can see who's attacking us.

01:35:36.320 --> 01:35:39.927
Yeah, these are the changes from
about 60 minutes ago.

01:35:46.640 --> 01:35:47.641
Hey!

01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:50.460
- Don't move, all right! Don't move!
- It's okay! Okay, all right!

01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:53.660
Cassie? My name's Ben Parish.
We used to go to high school together.

01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:55.250
I know who you are.

01:35:55.920 --> 01:35:57.160
What squad are you in?

01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:00.780
I'm looking for my brother, Sam.

01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:01.881
Sam?

01:36:02.640 --> 01:36:04.380
Sam Sullivan? Sam Sullivan?

01:36:04.480 --> 01:36:06.460
- You know my brother?
- Yes, yes, we're in the same squad.

01:36:06.560 --> 01:36:08.260
- You know where he is?
- I'm trying to get to him right now.

01:36:08.360 --> 01:36:10.820
All recruits report to the transport area.

01:36:10.920 --> 01:36:12.206
They're sending the kids off to war.

01:36:12.600 --> 01:36:14.420
Vosch. The Army. They're Others.

01:36:14.520 --> 01:36:17.100
Look, Sam is about to
get on one of those planes.

01:36:17.200 --> 01:36:19.340
If we don't go now, you're not gonna
see him again. You understand?

01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.580
We don't have much time.

01:36:20.680 --> 01:36:22.762
- All recruits report to the transport area.
- All right.

01:36:22.880 --> 01:36:24.370
- Ready?
- Come on.

01:36:27.520 --> 01:36:30.780
Once the recruits reach Wonderland,
get them ready for immediate deployment.

01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.961
Yes, sir.

01:36:36.960 --> 01:36:38.689
Transfer area's this way.

01:36:45.840 --> 01:36:46.940
Hey!

01:36:47.040 --> 01:36:48.371
This is a restricted area.

01:36:50.560 --> 01:36:51.971
- Hey, it's all right.
- On your knees!

01:36:52.280 --> 01:36:53.486
Hands behind your head!

01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:04.561
No, it's fine. He's one of us. It's okay.

01:37:05.080 --> 01:37:06.460
Evan, what are you doing here?

01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:07.721
Helping you.

01:37:10.480 --> 01:37:11.481
Who's he?

01:37:13.640 --> 01:37:14.641
Ben Parish.

01:37:16.280 --> 01:37:17.281
Ben Parish?

01:37:18.120 --> 01:37:19.281
Yeah.

01:37:20.400 --> 01:37:22.562
He was just here.

01:37:27.160 --> 01:37:28.660
I told you not to follow me.

01:37:28.760 --> 01:37:30.922
Well, I decided to ignore you.

01:37:32.120 --> 01:37:33.485
I've been planting bombs.

01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.140
In about 10 minutes,
when the last plane full of kids takes off,

01:37:37.240 --> 01:37:39.766
I'm taking this place down, for good.

01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.967
I'm sorry I lied to you, Cassie.

01:37:45.920 --> 01:37:50.130
I was wrong when I said
I was both one of you and one of them.

01:37:50.480 --> 01:37:53.131
You can't be both. You have to choose.

01:37:54.720 --> 01:37:56.085
I choose you.

01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:10.647
Go.

01:38:11.680 --> 01:38:13.091
Get out of here.

01:38:13.960 --> 01:38:15.325
I'll find you.

01:38:19.200 --> 01:38:21.407
- Who was that?
- Evan Walker.

01:38:22.720 --> 01:38:24.484
We gotta go find Sam.

01:38:25.320 --> 01:38:27.561
I think Evan Walker's about to
blow this place up.

01:38:32.240 --> 01:38:33.446
Next floor up.

01:38:34.560 --> 01:38:37.060
Head to the northeast corridor,
number 22, now!

01:38:37.160 --> 01:38:38.366
Which way?

01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.126
This way.

01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:53.411
Stay with your group leader.

01:38:57.080 --> 01:39:02.041
Proceed to the transport vehicles
in a calm and orderly fashion.

01:39:03.360 --> 01:39:05.328
Stay with your group leader.

01:39:07.520 --> 01:39:10.020
Proceed to the transport vehicles.

01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.726
Come on. Move along, people.

01:39:12.840 --> 01:39:13.940
Straight ahead.

01:39:14.040 --> 01:39:16.611
- Stay with your group leader.
- Keep it moving.

01:39:17.120 --> 01:39:19.780
- Don't fall behind, everyone.
- Where do they think they're going?

01:39:19.880 --> 01:39:23.441
Once you are on the plane,
you will receive further instructions.

01:39:23.560 --> 01:39:25.620
Keep moving. Straight ahead.

01:39:25.720 --> 01:39:27.609
Stay with your group leader.

01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.406
What's her problem?

01:39:38.880 --> 01:39:40.530
Sam! Sam!

01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:50.684
Sam! Sam! Sam.

01:39:51.080 --> 01:39:53.003
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

01:39:54.040 --> 01:39:55.180
Hi.

01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:56.691
- Cassie!
- Don't, don't.

01:39:57.720 --> 01:39:59.210
We gotta go, all right?

01:40:02.760 --> 01:40:03.921
Let's go.

01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:07.980
Once you are on the plane,
you will receive further instructions.

01:40:08.080 --> 01:40:09.206
Come on.

01:40:13.640 --> 01:40:14.766
Hi!

01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:17.442
I missed you so much, Sam.

01:40:21.200 --> 01:40:22.900
I missed you, Cassie.

01:40:23.000 --> 01:40:24.764
Look what I brought back for you.

01:40:26.600 --> 01:40:27.840
It's Bear.

01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.291
I love you.

01:40:34.960 --> 01:40:36.610
I love you, too, Sam.

01:40:37.280 --> 01:40:38.281
Hey.

01:40:40.440 --> 01:40:41.680
I gotta take his tracker out.

01:40:42.120 --> 01:40:44.009
All right? It's not gonna hurt, okay?

01:40:51.640 --> 01:40:52.620
Is it back up?

01:40:52.720 --> 01:40:54.100
All the recruits accounted for?

01:40:54.200 --> 01:40:55.700
Yes, sir. Six barracks left.

01:40:55.800 --> 01:40:56.860
Good.

01:40:56.960 --> 01:41:00.169
Power up my bird.
Last plane's in the air, evacuate the base.

01:41:14.240 --> 01:41:15.446
Come on!

01:41:17.000 --> 01:41:18.331
Shit! It's Vosch!

01:41:36.360 --> 01:41:38.488
Run! Run! Go for the truck!

01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.521
Go!

01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.370
Sam, run faster!

01:41:58.880 --> 01:42:00.041
Go! Go!

01:42:08.480 --> 01:42:09.720
Come on, Sam!

01:42:11.360 --> 01:42:12.725
- Run!
- Cassie!

01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:14.801
Shit!

01:42:15.880 --> 01:42:16.881
Who is that?

01:42:19.960 --> 01:42:21.371
- Come on!
- Come on! Get in!

01:42:23.360 --> 01:42:24.620
Come on!

01:42:24.720 --> 01:42:27.405
- Quick, Sammy. Get in!
- All right, come on! Get in! Get in!

01:42:28.720 --> 01:42:29.721
Drive!

01:42:35.320 --> 01:42:36.560
Thanks for coming back.

01:43:13.440 --> 01:43:15.408
- Feel better?
- Yeah, thanks, Dumbo.

01:43:16.680 --> 01:43:18.100
Make sure you give her the food first.

01:43:18.200 --> 01:43:19.929
Let me know if it starts hurting
or anything like that.

01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.660
- Okay.
- All right.

01:43:21.760 --> 01:43:23.460
Teacup, how you feeling?

01:43:23.560 --> 01:43:24.766
Pretty good.

01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:26.281
All right.

01:43:35.560 --> 01:43:37.210
How much longer for food?

01:43:37.560 --> 01:43:39.085
I don't know. Not long.

01:43:40.160 --> 01:43:41.366
What are you looking at?

01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.764
Trying to find the stars.

01:43:46.760 --> 01:43:48.569
It's a little early, isn't it?

01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.130
You were named after a star, right?

01:43:55.480 --> 01:43:57.084
Cassiopeia.

01:43:57.800 --> 01:43:59.165
Cassiopeia.

01:44:00.360 --> 01:44:03.011
Yeah. A cluster of stars.

01:44:05.280 --> 01:44:07.408
I was named after Ben & Jerry's.

01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:10.010
The truth. Yeah.

01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.248
Nothing made my dad happier
than ice cream.

01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:21.128
I'm sure you made him happier.

01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:28.441
Yeah.

01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:33.407
So...

01:44:35.600 --> 01:44:37.045
What do we do now?

01:44:38.960 --> 01:44:40.962
We have to save those other kids.

01:44:41.360 --> 01:44:42.441
Yeah.

01:44:43.360 --> 01:44:44.646
How are we gonna do that?

01:44:45.480 --> 01:44:46.561
Dinner's ready.

01:44:47.440 --> 01:44:48.521
I don't know yet.

01:44:53.520 --> 01:44:54.681
Well...

01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:01.124
Let's worry about that tomorrow
and just go get something to eat.

01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:03.961
All right.

01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:05.620
Hey, Sam.

01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:07.210
Here, wake up, buddy.

01:45:08.800 --> 01:45:10.529
Hey, there he is.

01:45:11.360 --> 01:45:12.486
Come on.

01:45:13.760 --> 01:45:16.684
Come on, lazy bones.
Put your bear down, would you?

01:45:25.720 --> 01:45:28.405
The Others see our hope as a weakness,

01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:31.410
as a delusion.

01:45:33.680 --> 01:45:35.011
But they're wrong.

01:45:37.400 --> 01:45:40.051
It's our hope that lets us survive.

01:45:43.320 --> 01:45:46.140
That lets us bend, but remain unbroken.

01:45:46.240 --> 01:45:48.607
- You two knew each other?
- Yeah, we went to high school together.

01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:52.840
It's our hope that will let us
win one day,

01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:01.610
It's our hope that makes us human.
