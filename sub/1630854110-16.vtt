<i>Quantum Leap

00:05.396 --> 00:07.920
<i>time travel program
years away from being tested.</i>

00:07.920 --> 00:09.400
Your name is Dr. Ben Song.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.315
<i>You're a time traveler
leaping from life to life,</i>

00:11.315 --> 00:13.143
<i>trying to put right
what once went wrong.</i>

00:13.143 --> 00:14.449
<i>Ben's working with someone.</i>

00:14.449 --> 00:16.103
<i>Al Calavicci's daughter, Janis.</i>

00:16.103 --> 00:19.367
She may be our best chance at
understanding what's going on.

00:19.367 --> 00:21.238
<i>Richard Martinez is another
leaper from the future,</i>

00:21.238 --> 00:23.284
<i>traveling through time
just like Ben.</i>

00:23.284 --> 00:25.068
Martinez,
he was on the Montana.

00:25.068 --> 00:26.852
We know. We're working
on a way to track him.

00:26.852 --> 00:28.245
<i>I isolated the anomalies</i>

00:28.245 --> 00:30.247
from both times
that we encountered Leaper X.

00:30.247 --> 00:31.857
Will this alert us
the next time

00:31.857 --> 00:33.120
Leaper X and Ben cross paths?

00:33.120 --> 00:34.556
<i>Well, it will now.</i>

00:38.864 --> 00:41.389
<i>♪ Bung, bung, bung, bung,

00:41.389 --> 00:43.304
<i>♪ Bung, bung, bung,

00:44.740 --> 00:46.698
Normal reflexes.

00:46.698 --> 00:48.483
Normal dilation.

00:48.483 --> 00:51.616
Hmm, we will confirm
with bloodwork,

00:51.616 --> 00:53.357
but it appears
that your husband

00:53.357 --> 00:55.533
is at least physically healthy,
Mrs. O'Connor.

00:55.533 --> 00:57.883
It's not his body
I'm worried about.

00:57.883 --> 01:00.060
I'd like to ask you a few
questions if that's all right.

01:00.060 --> 01:01.409
Sure.

01:01.409 --> 01:03.759
Who is the president
of the United States?

01:05.587 --> 01:06.718
It's OK, honey.

01:06.718 --> 01:08.111
You can do it.

01:08.111 --> 01:10.113
JFK?

01:10.113 --> 01:12.550
The senator?
Wouldn't he love that.

01:12.550 --> 01:13.725
All right.
How about today's date?

01:13.725 --> 01:15.858
Um, Tuesday?

01:15.858 --> 01:18.513
And your name.

01:22.212 --> 01:23.996
Mr. O'Connor.

01:23.996 --> 01:25.911
Doctor,
is this really necessary?

01:25.911 --> 01:28.871
My husband is clearly
not in his right mind.

01:28.871 --> 01:31.003
Right mind?
Of course I'm in my right mind.

01:31.003 --> 01:32.788
Why would I be of wrong mind?

01:32.788 --> 01:35.051
OK. I think
I should probably go, right?

01:35.051 --> 01:36.574
Liam.
Liam, you need help.

01:36.574 --> 01:37.923
They're going
to make you feel better here.

01:37.923 --> 01:40.056
We will know more
after further testing,

01:40.056 --> 01:42.102
but it's clear that
he has short-term memory loss,

01:42.102 --> 01:45.583
possibly due to shellshock
or late-onset schizophrenia.

01:45.583 --> 01:48.238
- Can you help him or not?
- I can.

01:48.238 --> 01:50.545
And I would like to begin
treatments immediately.

01:50.545 --> 01:52.895
Immediately?
That seems hasty.

01:52.895 --> 01:55.550
What about a second opinion or
perhaps we sleep on it, right?

01:55.550 --> 01:57.204
OK, I think I should probably--
- Can we have a moment alone?

01:57.204 --> 01:59.989
Of course. Yes.
Why don't I give you the room?

02:00.990 --> 02:03.862
Sweetheart, sweetheart,
sweetheart, it's for the best.

02:03.862 --> 02:05.168
It truly is.

02:07.605 --> 02:08.737
Nice work.

02:08.737 --> 02:10.913
You really sold
that memory loss.

02:10.913 --> 02:12.741
Thanks. It was a bit
of a stretch, but, uh--

02:12.741 --> 02:15.091
When you find my sister,
give her a message.

02:15.091 --> 02:16.658
Tell her
I would've gone in myself

02:16.658 --> 02:18.790
if I thought I could get us
both out in one piece.

02:18.790 --> 02:21.228
- But you think I can?
- For what you're charging,

02:21.228 --> 02:22.577
you better.

02:22.577 --> 02:25.101
You get me Judith back,
I'll get you your money.

02:25.101 --> 02:26.972
I promise.

02:26.972 --> 02:28.800
Please, please.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.193
She doesn't deserve this.

02:31.934 --> 02:34.893
Apologies,
but Lawrence has reminded me

02:34.893 --> 02:36.156
that I have another meeting.

02:36.156 --> 02:38.897
So how are we doing?

02:38.897 --> 02:40.029
Couldn't be better.

02:40.029 --> 02:43.424
Oh,
better is our business, Liam.

02:43.424 --> 02:45.513
Now, I know
how you must be feeling.

02:45.513 --> 02:48.646
You're disoriented, confused,
maybe even a little afraid.

02:48.646 --> 02:50.605
You wonder what's going on.
How did I get here?

02:50.605 --> 02:52.520
My promise to you is this:

02:52.520 --> 02:54.478
by the time we are through
with your treatments,

02:54.478 --> 02:57.438
you will be a changed man.

02:57.438 --> 03:00.963
Oh, thank you, Doctor.

03:05.054 --> 03:06.360
Hello.

03:08.797 --> 03:10.755
Beautiful building.

03:14.324 --> 03:16.326
Where exactly is my room?

03:16.326 --> 03:18.023
This is
your personal schedule.

03:18.023 --> 03:21.331
That's your bible in here.
Treatment, labor, enrichment.

03:21.331 --> 03:23.246
Follow the rules,
and we won't have a problem.

03:23.246 --> 03:24.813
Don't, and we will.

03:24.813 --> 03:26.467
Bathroom duty
for a first offense.

03:26.467 --> 03:29.078
After that,
things get more serious.

03:29.078 --> 03:30.993
Structure is sanity.

03:30.993 --> 03:32.864
If you threaten that,

03:32.864 --> 03:35.650
you threaten
every patient here.

03:35.650 --> 03:37.869
And I won't let that happen.

04:03.373 --> 04:05.680
Wait.
This is my room?

04:05.680 --> 04:06.942
OK, OK.

04:16.299 --> 04:17.605
Lights out in two.

04:19.389 --> 04:22.087
Are we gonna have problems,
O'Connor?

04:22.087 --> 04:23.480
No problems.

04:23.480 --> 04:25.265
Only purpose.

04:37.712 --> 04:38.974
- This place is a nightmare.
- Aah!

04:38.974 --> 04:41.281
Yeah.

04:41.281 --> 04:43.326
And I'm living it.

04:43.326 --> 04:46.242
So let's just do
whatever I'm supposed to do

04:46.242 --> 04:47.635
and get me out of here.
- Yeah.

04:47.635 --> 04:49.637
I already know I'm
someone named Liam O'Connor.

04:49.637 --> 04:51.900
A private eye out of Boston.

04:51.900 --> 04:54.642
Looks like he was hired
by Elaine Sullivan

04:54.642 --> 04:58.776
to break her sister, Judith,
out of George's Island Asylum.

04:58.776 --> 05:00.561
Does Ziggy know what got
her sister put in here?

05:00.561 --> 05:04.173
Judith's husband had her
committed for hysteria.

05:04.173 --> 05:08.046
Church records show
that he used that "unfitness"

05:08.046 --> 05:10.527
to get an annulment
and remarry three months later.

05:10.527 --> 05:12.790
- Oh, nice guy.
- Yeah, well, nice system.

05:12.790 --> 05:14.488
Not exactly
"Leave it to Beaver," is it?

05:14.488 --> 05:16.098
Which is why we need
to get Judith out of here.

05:16.098 --> 05:18.056
So what did Liam do wrong
in the original history?

05:18.056 --> 05:19.623
Ziggy
doesn't have the specifics,

05:19.623 --> 05:22.191
but this looks like
it was Liam's last job.

05:22.191 --> 05:24.324
Judith never left the asylum.

05:26.021 --> 05:27.979
And neither did he.

05:27.979 --> 05:29.677
Terrific.

05:29.677 --> 05:32.419
OK. Don't worry.
We're gonna figure this out.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.378
In the meantime,
maybe the universe wants you

05:35.378 --> 05:36.945
to finally get
a good night's sleep.

05:36.945 --> 05:39.774
In here?
Good one, universe.

05:39.774 --> 05:40.775
If it makes you
feel any better,

05:40.775 --> 05:42.516
I wish
I could keep you company.

05:45.867 --> 05:47.347
Me too.

05:47.347 --> 05:48.870
I'll be back
before you wake up.

06:19.509 --> 06:21.903
Whoa. You OK?

06:21.903 --> 06:23.731
This place is creepy,
all right?

06:23.731 --> 06:26.864
How's anyone's mental health
supposed to get better in here?

06:26.864 --> 06:29.954
OK. Well, I take it
that you didn't sleep.

06:29.954 --> 06:31.042
Does this look
like a map to you?

06:31.042 --> 06:32.217
It looks like a map,
doesn't it?

06:32.217 --> 06:33.654
This--this is a map, right?

06:33.654 --> 06:35.220
Maybe it's a way out.

06:35.220 --> 06:36.526
OK.

06:36.526 --> 06:37.962
I'll have Ian
run the schematics

06:37.962 --> 06:40.269
and see if we can find
any passageways or tunnels.

06:40.269 --> 06:42.750
But, Ben,
hey, look,

06:42.750 --> 06:45.883
Ziggy says you need to stick
to Dr. Mueller's schedule, OK?

06:45.883 --> 06:47.363
Don't go snooping around yet.

06:47.363 --> 06:50.061
It could raise suspicions
and compromise your escape.

06:51.367 --> 06:52.934
OK, I have to go.

06:52.934 --> 06:55.458
Look, just focus
on finding Judith at breakfast.

06:55.458 --> 06:56.764
Here.

06:56.764 --> 06:57.808
OK.

06:57.808 --> 06:59.201
Uh...

06:59.201 --> 07:01.508
OK, I will be back as soon
as we find a way out.

07:01.508 --> 07:02.770
Find it quick, please.

07:06.774 --> 07:09.777
Just sitting here,
mumbling to yourself.

07:09.777 --> 07:13.084
What's it like talking to
someone who really isn't there?

07:13.084 --> 07:14.477
Frustrating.

07:14.477 --> 07:16.261
Hey.

07:16.261 --> 07:18.133
How goes the escape route?

07:18.133 --> 07:19.482
Nothing yet.

07:19.482 --> 07:20.614
Well, maybe this will help.

07:20.614 --> 07:23.486
Venti dark roast,
venti blonde roast.

07:23.486 --> 07:26.097
Ooh, thank you.

07:26.097 --> 07:28.752
Is that a--
is that a hot chocolate?

07:28.752 --> 07:31.233
That is adorable.

07:32.713 --> 07:34.192
Sir.

07:34.192 --> 07:36.760
Well, I could use
a little comfort today.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.067
- Mm.
- I'm worried about Ben.

07:39.067 --> 07:42.549
1954 was a dark time
for mental health.

07:42.549 --> 07:44.464
Hey, how is
that escape route coming?

07:44.464 --> 07:46.770
OK, so the two of you just
asking me the same question

07:46.770 --> 07:48.859
isn't gonna make it
happen any faster,

07:48.859 --> 07:51.471
especially not when I'm pulling
double duty running security.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.081
Wait. Where's Jenn?

07:53.081 --> 07:54.561
She had a cough.
I sent her home.

07:54.561 --> 07:56.432
The last thing I need
is for all of us

07:56.432 --> 07:58.129
to get sick right now.

07:58.129 --> 08:00.044
As for Ben's escape...

08:00.044 --> 08:01.785
Well, I've already
cross-referenced

08:01.785 --> 08:02.917
the asylum schematics

08:02.917 --> 08:04.484
with the drawings
found in his cell.

08:04.484 --> 08:08.531
And they do, in fact,
represent a series of tunnels.

08:08.531 --> 08:11.099
Now, Ziggy should hopefully
have a path mapped out soon.

08:11.099 --> 08:13.449
Great. I wanna get Ben
out of there ASAP.

08:13.449 --> 08:15.799
I got a bad feeling
about this leap.

08:15.799 --> 08:18.149
- That makes all of us.
- Oh, thank you.

08:20.021 --> 08:24.504
Um, Janis' ankle monitor
is being tampered with.

08:24.504 --> 08:25.983
- Is Janis on the run?
- No, not yet.

08:25.983 --> 08:27.594
She's still
at her mother's house.

08:27.594 --> 08:30.248
- We should've kept her here.
- She's under house arrest.

08:30.248 --> 08:33.295
Besides this is a time travel
project, not a prison.

08:33.295 --> 08:35.645
And she just took it off.

08:35.645 --> 08:37.995
OK, well, we can't let her
get off the grid.

08:37.995 --> 08:39.214
Do you need me to handle this?

08:39.214 --> 08:41.216
I got it.
Keep working on the exit.

08:41.216 --> 08:43.087
<i>all: ♪ Life could be a dream</i>

08:43.087 --> 08:45.437

08:56.666 --> 08:58.755
Looking for a booth
by the window?

08:58.755 --> 09:00.540
Seats are assigned.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.324
This one's yours.

09:11.333 --> 09:12.682
Skip the sausage.

09:12.682 --> 09:15.119
Think
I'll skip the whole thing.

09:15.119 --> 09:18.383
Coffee's dishwater,
but it's hot.

09:18.383 --> 09:20.124
Name's Ralph.

09:20.124 --> 09:21.909
Liam.

09:23.737 --> 09:26.609
Do you know Judith?

09:26.609 --> 09:27.828
Sure. Nice gal.

09:27.828 --> 09:29.394
Haven't seen her
in a few days, though.

09:29.394 --> 09:30.613
A few days?

09:30.613 --> 09:32.223
Is that normal?

09:32.223 --> 09:33.485
In here, it is.

09:33.485 --> 09:35.226
Folks disappear all the time,

09:35.226 --> 09:37.620
especially if they stand up
for themselves.

09:37.620 --> 09:39.317
Sometimes when they come back,

09:39.317 --> 09:41.058
their eyes are dead,

09:41.058 --> 09:44.061
like something inside them
just switched off.

09:44.061 --> 09:46.107
Sometimes
they don't come back at all.

09:46.107 --> 09:48.370
- That's not right.
- Right?

09:50.590 --> 09:55.072
Only right in here is, "Do
as I say and don't talk back."

09:55.072 --> 09:57.379
I'd tell you
to ask my buddy, Lou,

09:57.379 --> 09:59.686
but he can't talk no more,

09:59.686 --> 10:01.601
not after
what Doc Mueller did to him.

10:08.651 --> 10:11.132
Hey, there's your girl, Judith.

10:24.145 --> 10:25.494
Excuse me.

10:25.494 --> 10:28.062
May I use some of your creamer?
Mine's all out.

10:32.806 --> 10:36.548
Judith,
your sister, Elaine, sent me.

10:36.548 --> 10:37.941
I'm a private detective.

10:37.941 --> 10:40.640
I'm here to get you home.

10:40.640 --> 10:44.339
Judith, do you remember Elaine?

10:44.339 --> 10:46.036
You said no problems!

10:46.036 --> 10:47.951
What part of assigned seats
confuses you?

10:50.301 --> 10:51.607
Leave him alone!

10:51.607 --> 10:52.521
What are you doing there,
Ralph?

10:52.521 --> 10:53.914
Ralph, please.

10:53.914 --> 10:55.872
It's OK.
Just sit down.

10:55.872 --> 10:57.004
You throw that,
that's your last strike.

10:57.004 --> 10:58.832
I already struck out!

10:58.832 --> 11:00.616
Well, I'm done with it!
You hear me?

11:00.616 --> 11:01.617
Done with it!

11:11.322 --> 11:12.759
Show me your schedule.

11:15.370 --> 11:16.414
OK.

11:17.851 --> 11:19.853
We have
the same enrichment block.

11:19.853 --> 11:21.811
Find me during library time.
We'll talk there.

11:21.811 --> 11:23.813
Take him
to Dr. Mueller's office.

11:23.813 --> 11:26.424
Quiet!

11:26.424 --> 11:27.991
Anyone else wanna join him?

11:27.991 --> 11:31.299
You?

11:33.910 --> 11:38.175
Addison,
I need that escape route.

11:40.787 --> 11:43.050
- What?
- What?

11:45.356 --> 11:47.010
- Ian?
- Yeah?

11:47.010 --> 11:49.360
You might be one
of the most talented people

11:49.360 --> 11:51.232
that I have ever met.
- Thank you.

11:51.232 --> 11:54.975
Yeah, but when it comes
to a poker face, you stink.

11:54.975 --> 11:56.672
What did you find?

11:56.672 --> 12:00.545
I found more about George's
Island Asylum's history.

12:00.545 --> 12:02.069
And?

12:02.069 --> 12:03.897
And...

12:03.897 --> 12:07.030
they shuttered the entire place
in the 1970s.

12:07.030 --> 12:09.772
Now, they kept it quiet,
but Mueller's methods,

12:09.772 --> 12:11.382
they went far
beyond physical punishment.

12:11.382 --> 12:14.646
He was treating them all
like they were guinea pigs,

12:14.646 --> 12:17.780
testing his experimental
surgical procedures on them

12:17.780 --> 12:19.086
and then
covering up their deaths

12:19.086 --> 12:22.045
any time he lost one
on the operating table.

12:22.045 --> 12:24.744
OK, we need
to get Ben out of there now.

12:24.744 --> 12:26.136
I know.
I know, just--

12:26.136 --> 12:28.791
One escape route
coming right on up.

12:28.791 --> 12:30.924
OK.

12:33.665 --> 12:36.146
Really?
- Whoa.

12:36.146 --> 12:37.887
Well, any other requests
while we're here?

12:37.887 --> 12:40.324
Yeah, send it to my handlink.

12:40.324 --> 12:42.849
And thank Ziggy for me.

12:42.849 --> 12:44.415
Got it.

12:44.415 --> 12:48.115
You are welcome, Addison.

12:54.295 --> 12:55.252
Ah.

12:55.252 --> 12:57.689
Magic.

12:57.689 --> 13:00.954
Oh, what a lovely surprise.

13:00.954 --> 13:03.260
Well, I wish I could say
it was a social call.

13:03.260 --> 13:06.263
Is Janis here?

13:06.263 --> 13:08.744
Mom,
can you give us a minute?

13:08.744 --> 13:10.093
What did you do now?

13:12.487 --> 13:14.706
Why did you take off
the ankle monitor?

13:14.706 --> 13:15.882
What game are you playing?

13:15.882 --> 13:17.622
You promised
to keep me up to speed.

13:17.622 --> 13:19.755
We do. You're getting the
leap reports as we file them.

13:19.755 --> 13:21.757
It's not fast enough.
By the time I get anything,

13:21.757 --> 13:23.367
it's all ancient history.

13:23.367 --> 13:24.891
Fine.

13:24.891 --> 13:27.458
Have Ben and Martinez
crossed paths again recently?

13:27.458 --> 13:29.025
- Yes.
- That.

13:29.025 --> 13:31.245
That is the kind of thing
that I need to know right away.

13:31.245 --> 13:33.247
I can't help you, Magic,
if you keep me out of the loop.

13:33.247 --> 13:34.901
I don't even know
what year Ben is in.

13:34.901 --> 13:36.511
1954.

13:38.556 --> 13:40.210
What?

13:40.210 --> 13:42.865
Where are you going?
Is that bad?

13:42.865 --> 13:44.649
There is an order
to Ben's leaps.

13:44.649 --> 13:47.478
And if he is in 1954,
this is our last chance.

13:47.478 --> 13:48.479
Last chance for what?

13:48.479 --> 13:49.959
Let's go!

13:56.009 --> 13:57.880
"The Odyssey."
Reminds me of you.

13:57.880 --> 13:59.142
I hope not.

13:59.142 --> 14:01.710
It took Odysseus ten years
to get home.

14:01.710 --> 14:02.972
Odysseus didn't have me.

14:04.452 --> 14:08.499
- Did the map in my cell help?
- Kinda.

14:08.499 --> 14:10.153
Ian was able
to cross-reference it

14:10.153 --> 14:11.372
with all surviving
building records.

14:11.372 --> 14:14.549
And we think
we found your way out.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.855
Think?

14:15.855 --> 14:17.204
It's the best we got.

14:17.204 --> 14:18.814
I'll walk you through it
as soon as we find--oh.

14:18.814 --> 14:20.990
Oh.

14:20.990 --> 14:24.037
Judith, hey, I found a way out.

14:24.037 --> 14:25.690
That's great,
but I can't leave yet.

14:25.690 --> 14:27.344
What? Why?

14:27.344 --> 14:29.433
I can't leave the others.
Ralph and--

14:29.433 --> 14:31.783
Elaine didn't forget about me,
and I won't forget about them.

14:31.783 --> 14:36.005
Ben, Ziggy says a mass escape
has a 99% chance of failure.

14:36.005 --> 14:37.833
I get it, I do.

14:37.833 --> 14:40.357
But if we try to save everyone,
then no one gets home.

14:40.357 --> 14:43.230
I know, which is
why we have to stop Mueller,

14:43.230 --> 14:45.362
get him arrested
before he can hurt anyone else.

14:45.362 --> 14:47.277
OK. Fine, then we go to the
police once we get you out.

14:47.277 --> 14:48.800
You think
a Boston cop will believe

14:48.800 --> 14:51.194
a hysterical woman
who escaped an insane asylum?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.980
We need hard evidence--
Mueller's files.

14:53.980 --> 14:55.198
It's the only way to help

14:55.198 --> 14:56.330
all the other people
suffering in here.

14:56.330 --> 14:58.245
This leap is
about freeing Judith.

14:58.245 --> 15:01.030
You have to stay on mission.

15:01.030 --> 15:04.033
So you're telling me
we can't get you out

15:04.033 --> 15:05.905
unless we get those files?

15:07.428 --> 15:10.170
So I guess that's our mission.
So how do we get them?

15:10.170 --> 15:12.389
The doctor keeps his files
in his real office.

15:12.389 --> 15:14.783
And he goes to Bible study
every evening at 5:00.

15:14.783 --> 15:16.350
Perfect. We'll break in then.

15:16.350 --> 15:18.178
Do you know a safe way
to get there?

15:18.178 --> 15:20.093
You're the detective.

15:20.093 --> 15:21.877
I was hoping
you could figure that out.

15:23.705 --> 15:26.012
I might have a lead.

15:26.012 --> 15:27.448
Or two.

15:31.452 --> 15:34.063
OK. Are you sure
Ben is gonna fit in there?

15:34.063 --> 15:37.632
His host is a little... husky.

15:37.632 --> 15:39.590
Well, I'll have Ziggy
run the numbers,

15:39.590 --> 15:42.985
but honestly, this is
the only path that we have.

15:42.985 --> 15:44.900
- OK.
- Oh, no.

15:44.900 --> 15:46.684
- What?
- This is bad.

15:46.684 --> 15:48.164
Quantum anomaly?

15:48.164 --> 15:50.427
Wait.
Is that what I think it is?

15:50.427 --> 15:52.908
Not what.

15:52.908 --> 15:54.649
Who.

15:57.695 --> 16:00.089
Excuse me.

16:00.089 --> 16:02.222
Ben, Martinez is coming.

16:02.222 --> 16:03.614
Keep moving.
Don't worry.

16:03.614 --> 16:06.095
I'll find him.
- Let's go, people.

16:06.095 --> 16:08.793
Come on.
Keep it moving.

16:08.793 --> 16:10.186
Faster.

16:26.072 --> 16:28.074
Hey,
what is Martinez doing there?

16:28.074 --> 16:29.597
I-I don't know.

16:29.597 --> 16:32.295
The tracker only tells me
when he leaps, not how or why.

16:32.295 --> 16:36.125
But--but I did find something
very, very interesting.

16:36.125 --> 16:37.474
OK.

16:37.474 --> 16:38.954
This is a misfiled report

16:38.954 --> 16:42.218
from the old
Quantum Leap program.

16:42.218 --> 16:44.307
- Evil Leapers?
- Mm-hmm.

16:44.307 --> 16:47.919
Yeah, apparently Sam Beckett
had run-ins with other Leapers.

16:47.919 --> 16:50.705
The report says
that evil Leapers were leaping

16:50.705 --> 16:52.446
to put wrong
what once went right.

16:52.446 --> 16:54.230
OK, so the opposite of Ben.

16:54.230 --> 16:56.276
I mean, Martinez is there
to hurt people.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.147
I don't know.
Something doesn't make sense.

16:58.147 --> 16:59.322
But think about it.

16:59.322 --> 17:01.803
He could've sabotaged Ben
at Salvation.

17:01.803 --> 17:05.024
<i>Why did he help Ben
on the U.S.S. Montana?</i>

17:05.024 --> 17:07.939
OK,
but we didn't see Martinez

17:07.939 --> 17:09.419
until the end of those leaps.

17:09.419 --> 17:11.030
For all we know,
he could have

17:11.030 --> 17:12.988
<i>helped McDonough set the fire.</i>

17:12.988 --> 17:14.511
<i>And he could've
convinced Drake</i>

17:14.511 --> 17:16.774
<i>to turn the Cold War hot.</i>

17:18.124 --> 17:19.429
I'm going back in.

17:21.866 --> 17:23.303
OK, Ben.

17:23.303 --> 17:24.695
We modified your escape route

17:24.695 --> 17:26.349
to take you
through Mueller's office

17:26.349 --> 17:28.699
so you can get the files.

17:28.699 --> 17:31.615
Now, are you sure
she's ready for this?

17:31.615 --> 17:33.095
She was earlier.

17:33.095 --> 17:35.097
OK.

17:35.097 --> 17:38.057
I think you're supposed
to be painting that fruit bowl.

17:39.667 --> 17:41.190
I miss flowers.

17:41.190 --> 17:42.974
I used to garden.

17:42.974 --> 17:46.587
It made me feel good
to help something grow after...

17:49.807 --> 17:53.724
Charles and I wanted children.

17:53.724 --> 17:58.338
We tried for years,
but I kept...

17:58.338 --> 17:59.904
losing them.

17:59.904 --> 18:01.906
After I lost the fourth one,

18:01.906 --> 18:04.735
I told him
I couldn't do it anymore.

18:04.735 --> 18:08.304
I guess
that's why he put me in here.

18:09.914 --> 18:11.438
Ben, it's almost 5:00.

18:11.438 --> 18:13.309
You have to get her
to the doctor's office.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.616
Let's get those files
and get out of here.

18:20.055 --> 18:22.405
Mr. O'Connor,
what are you doing?

18:22.405 --> 18:24.059
This is expressionism.

18:24.059 --> 18:25.843
I'm expressing myself.
- Liam!

18:25.843 --> 18:27.932
Mr. O'Connor,
that's a first offense.

18:27.932 --> 18:29.891
Bathroom duty, now.
- It's Judith's fault.

18:29.891 --> 18:31.762
She told me to do it.

18:31.762 --> 18:34.243
Judith,
please join Mr. O'Connor

18:34.243 --> 18:36.637
in scrubbing out
the main floor lavatory.

18:36.637 --> 18:39.074
I expected better from you.

18:48.301 --> 18:49.998
Thanks.

18:49.998 --> 18:51.521
Why did you do that?
I thought you were

18:51.521 --> 18:53.132
trying to help me escape.
- I am.

19:03.098 --> 19:04.143
OK.

19:15.284 --> 19:16.372
Come on. Come on.
Come on. Come on.

19:19.245 --> 19:21.203
All right.

19:21.203 --> 19:23.814
How do you know that vent
leads to the doctor's office?

19:23.814 --> 19:25.468
Because a team
of highly-skilled geniuses

19:25.468 --> 19:27.731
just spent all night
figuring it out for me.

19:29.733 --> 19:32.301
I'm a detective.
It's what I do. Come on.

19:34.347 --> 19:35.304
God.

19:43.399 --> 19:45.749
What's all this?

19:45.749 --> 19:47.316
This is
where he keeps his files.

19:47.316 --> 19:50.972
I've seen him opening it
during our therapy sessions.

19:50.972 --> 19:52.147
I'll work on the safe.

19:52.147 --> 19:53.757
You call your sister
to come get us.

19:53.757 --> 19:55.194
OK.

19:57.065 --> 19:59.154
Hey, know how this works?

19:59.154 --> 20:01.200
Locks I've picked,
but this, I don't know.

20:01.200 --> 20:04.681
Here.
Grab that stethoscope.

20:04.681 --> 20:06.727
OK, put it right over the lock,

20:06.727 --> 20:08.250
like you're listening
for a heartbeat.

20:08.250 --> 20:10.339
And then, just listen
as the notches line up.

20:10.339 --> 20:12.080
- OK.
- Elaine?

20:12.080 --> 20:13.473
It's me.
It's Judith.

20:13.473 --> 20:16.476
Listen, I can't talk,
but we're about to get out.

20:16.476 --> 20:19.609
Can you meet us in the
parking lot behind the asylum?

20:19.609 --> 20:20.915
Perfect.

20:20.915 --> 20:22.873
And, Elaine,
if we're not there by 8:00,

20:22.873 --> 20:24.266
promise me you'll go home.

20:24.266 --> 20:25.702
Promise me.

20:25.702 --> 20:28.052
I don't want you trapped
on this godforsaken island.

20:28.052 --> 20:31.708
Whatever happens,
thanks for not forgetting me.

20:31.708 --> 20:33.536
OK.

20:34.624 --> 20:35.669
- You ready?
- Yeah.

20:35.669 --> 20:37.801
We have to hurry.

20:37.801 --> 20:39.063
Where do you think
you're going?

20:40.326 --> 20:41.762
- You stay away from her.
- Keep your voice down.

20:41.762 --> 20:43.372
I'm here to help you.
- I doubt that.

20:44.547 --> 20:46.375
I'm here to help you.

20:50.684 --> 20:53.077
Help us?
Why would you do that?

20:53.077 --> 20:54.818
You gotta just trust me.
We don't have--

20:54.818 --> 20:57.604
You've done nothing
but make our lives hell!

20:57.604 --> 21:00.694
Oh, hey.
Good work, Lawrence.

21:00.694 --> 21:02.173
Find out where that vent leads

21:02.173 --> 21:03.523
and make sure
this can't happen again.

21:09.833 --> 21:12.096
Judith,
seems that none of my methods

21:12.096 --> 21:13.620
have calmed your hysteria.

21:13.620 --> 21:15.361
That's not your failure.

21:15.361 --> 21:17.276
It's mine.

21:17.276 --> 21:18.886
Prep her for surgery.
- No.

21:18.886 --> 21:20.279
And then meet me
in the intake office.

21:20.279 --> 21:22.890
I have some questions
for Mr. O'Connor.

21:22.890 --> 21:24.631
- No.
- No, no. no.

21:24.631 --> 21:25.806
- No, no!
- No, Judith!

21:25.806 --> 21:27.242
Judith, no!
- No, no!

21:27.242 --> 21:28.417
- Judith, no!
- No, no!

21:28.417 --> 21:29.592
Don't let them take me!

21:29.592 --> 21:31.420
No, no!

21:31.420 --> 21:32.465
Let go of me! Judith!

21:35.685 --> 21:37.948
Stop!

21:39.428 --> 21:40.603
What was that?

21:40.603 --> 21:42.518
And the truth
shall set you free.

21:42.518 --> 21:45.086
Sodium thiopental,
AKA truth serum.

21:45.086 --> 21:49.482
OK, you are gonna feel
a little loopy and very chatty.

21:49.482 --> 21:50.918
You need to fight that.

21:50.918 --> 21:52.746
So what were you doing
in my office?

21:52.746 --> 21:54.400
Stealing your medical files.

21:54.400 --> 21:57.446
Oh, I see what you mean.
- Yeah. Come on, Ben.

21:57.446 --> 21:59.579
See what who means?
Who are you?

21:59.579 --> 22:02.364
Liam O'Connor.
You are Liam O'Connor.

22:03.539 --> 22:05.411
- Liam O'Connor.
- You seem uncertain.

22:05.411 --> 22:06.412
- I am.
- Ben.

22:06.412 --> 22:07.630
- Hmm?
- Ben!

22:07.630 --> 22:08.892
Who are you really?

22:10.024 --> 22:11.504
Ben.

22:11.504 --> 22:15.595
Dr. Ben Song.

22:15.595 --> 22:17.553
Are you a journalist?
Who do you work for?

22:17.553 --> 22:19.381
"The Globe"?
"The Times?"

22:19.381 --> 22:22.776
I...work...

22:22.776 --> 22:25.561
at Quantum Leap.

22:26.823 --> 22:29.826
It's a secret government
time travel project.

22:29.826 --> 22:32.046
Ben, do you understand
what they are gonna do to you?

22:32.046 --> 22:33.569
So tell me more about

22:33.569 --> 22:35.832
Dr. Ben Song,
the time traveler.

22:35.832 --> 22:39.575
I leap into other people's
bodies to fix the past.

22:39.575 --> 22:42.361
So we're in the past
right now?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.101
Mm-hmm.
And what year are you from?

22:44.101 --> 22:47.975
I leaped from the year 2022

22:47.975 --> 22:51.935
to save my fiancée from--

22:51.935 --> 22:53.372
I can't remember what.

22:53.372 --> 22:56.505
Ben, I am begging you.
Please, please stop talking.

22:56.505 --> 22:59.769
OK, then, Dr. Ben Song,

22:59.769 --> 23:01.858
tell me, doctor to doctor,

23:01.858 --> 23:04.165
why do you want
my medical files?

23:04.165 --> 23:06.428
To put you in prison,

23:06.428 --> 23:10.519
to save Judith
and everyone else in here

23:10.519 --> 23:12.478
from your cruelty,

23:12.478 --> 23:15.437
your ego,
and your madness.

23:15.437 --> 23:17.352
You're a monster.

23:17.352 --> 23:19.789
You're a monster
who thinks he's an angel,

23:19.789 --> 23:21.400
and you need to be stopped.

23:22.923 --> 23:26.709
This man is clearly suffering
from advanced delusions.

23:26.709 --> 23:29.320
He's a danger not only
to himself, but to others.

23:29.320 --> 23:31.322
Get the straitjacket.
- No.

23:31.322 --> 23:34.848
No, no.

23:34.848 --> 23:38.025
I have been looking
for a subject like you,

23:38.025 --> 23:40.462
one whose mind
I can study on the table

23:40.462 --> 23:43.073
while I keep you alive.

23:43.073 --> 23:46.033
We'll start right after
I take care of your friend.

23:49.906 --> 23:54.911
Ben, I am going to figure out
a way out of this for you.

23:54.911 --> 23:57.697
Your drugs are gonna wear off
in about ten minutes, OK?

23:57.697 --> 24:00.961
I am gonna come back
as soon as I can.

24:00.961 --> 24:03.833
I'm not gonna leave you here.
I promise.

24:11.406 --> 24:13.626
- We--we just can't do that.
- No.

24:13.626 --> 24:15.410
That is the only way
to make this work.

24:15.410 --> 24:17.412
What is she doing here?

24:17.412 --> 24:19.893
Really?
I thought we were good.

24:19.893 --> 24:21.242
Janis is trying
to convince us

24:21.242 --> 24:22.939
to tell Ben not to save Judith.

24:22.939 --> 24:25.159
Have you forgotten
how Quantum Leap works?

24:25.159 --> 24:27.204
He saves the person
so that Ben leaps.

24:27.204 --> 24:29.250
Correct, but we want Ben
to stop leaping.

24:29.250 --> 24:30.512
That doesn't make any sense.

24:30.512 --> 24:31.992
I don't understand
why she's here today.

24:31.992 --> 24:33.776
Addison, you don't understand
that Martinez leaps

24:33.776 --> 24:36.257
the same way Ben does,
by helping people.

24:36.257 --> 24:37.737
They're obviously
using the same machine,

24:37.737 --> 24:39.652
so maybe they're using
the same Ziggy,

24:39.652 --> 24:41.262
just in different timelines.

24:41.262 --> 24:44.439
Maybe Ziggy thinks that this
mission requires two Leapers.

24:44.439 --> 24:45.788
Look, all I know
is that Ben had

24:45.788 --> 24:47.703
to sabotage one
of Martinez's leaps

24:47.703 --> 24:49.836
to prevent him from reaching
his final destination,

24:49.836 --> 24:52.621
which, in this case, is when
he's gonna try and kill you.

24:55.494 --> 24:56.669
The path Ben is on,

24:56.669 --> 24:58.932
he has three chances
to stop Martinez.

24:58.932 --> 25:00.281
Salvation, the battleship...

25:00.281 --> 25:01.587
And now.

25:01.587 --> 25:03.284
Ben has to sabotage the leap.

25:03.284 --> 25:04.677
OK, hang on.

25:04.677 --> 25:07.506
If he sabotages the leap,
what happens to Ben?

25:07.506 --> 25:09.986
He's stranded in 1954.

25:11.945 --> 25:13.512
Forever.

25:16.166 --> 25:19.169
You knew this was Ben's plan
the entire time?

25:20.519 --> 25:21.955
I don't believe her.

25:21.955 --> 25:23.347
She'd have said
something before.

25:23.347 --> 25:25.306
You couldn't be trusted.

25:25.306 --> 25:26.481
Why do you think
I've been trying

25:26.481 --> 25:28.135
to talk to Ben myself
this entire time?

25:28.135 --> 25:29.571
You think
I just built an imaging chamber

25:29.571 --> 25:30.659
as a side hustle?

25:30.659 --> 25:32.052
And the only reason
I am telling you

25:32.052 --> 25:33.227
any of this right now
is because

25:33.227 --> 25:36.012
this is Ben's last chance
to stop Martinez

25:36.012 --> 25:38.014
before he reaches
his final target,

25:38.014 --> 25:40.103
which is you.

25:40.103 --> 25:42.149
Magic,
you have got to tell him.

25:42.149 --> 25:44.107
I promise you
this is what he wanted.

25:44.107 --> 25:46.240
He was gonna try and find
another way to stop Martinez.

25:46.240 --> 25:47.850
But if all else failed,
he was going

25:47.850 --> 25:49.504
to sacrifice himself
for the greater good.

25:49.504 --> 25:50.636
She's lying!

25:50.636 --> 25:52.986
Ben swore to me
in his video message

25:52.986 --> 25:54.596
that he was gonna
make it back to me.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.641
Have you ever lied
to someone you love

25:55.641 --> 25:58.557
to try
to make them feel better?

25:58.557 --> 26:01.037
Ian.

26:01.037 --> 26:02.822
You have any idea
how to figure out

26:02.822 --> 26:04.998
whether Janis is lying or not?

26:04.998 --> 26:08.349
If Martinez is using
the same technology as us,

26:08.349 --> 26:09.568
he can see me, right?

26:09.568 --> 26:11.874
Yeah. Why?

26:11.874 --> 26:14.529
Addison, don't do it. No.

26:14.529 --> 26:16.705
Addison. Addison.
Hey, Magic.

26:16.705 --> 26:18.228
Magic, you have
to stop her right now.

26:18.228 --> 26:19.839
Janis, enough.

26:19.839 --> 26:21.492
Listen,
when I restarted this project,

26:21.492 --> 26:25.018
I swore to your father
we'd never lose another Leaper.

26:25.018 --> 26:26.672
Now, I'm sorry
if this goes against

26:26.672 --> 26:28.325
whatever you and Ben agreed to,

26:28.325 --> 26:30.676
but I'm not breaking my promise
to Al.

26:30.676 --> 26:33.069
Well, congratulations then.

26:33.069 --> 26:35.594
You're about to win a battle
that's gonna cost you the war.

26:41.687 --> 26:43.471
She'll be under
for about half an hour.

26:43.471 --> 26:45.734
The doctor will be up shortly.

26:47.780 --> 26:49.172
Dr. Mueller says

26:49.172 --> 26:51.131
the patient needs
to come with me right away.

26:51.131 --> 26:53.655
He just told us
to prep her for surgery.

26:53.655 --> 26:56.223
Well, I guess
he changed his mind.

26:56.223 --> 26:58.617
If it's all the same, I'll
wait to hear that from him.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.531
I've worked here ten years.

27:00.531 --> 27:02.055
Doc's never called off
a lobotomy.

27:02.055 --> 27:03.665
No, no.

27:03.665 --> 27:04.666
Get away from me.

27:04.666 --> 27:05.972
Get away!

27:05.972 --> 27:07.626
You're upsetting the patient.

27:07.626 --> 27:10.150
Go find someone else to scare.

27:19.507 --> 27:21.291
Martinez, don't.

27:23.380 --> 27:24.817
So you can see me.

27:27.558 --> 27:30.649
Are you really here to help?

27:30.649 --> 27:33.913
Then put that down,
and let's talk.

27:40.397 --> 27:42.922
You need to help Ben.
- I'm not here to help Ben.

27:42.922 --> 27:43.923
I'm here to do
what he couldn't.

27:43.923 --> 27:45.402
Stay out of my way.

27:45.402 --> 27:47.404
I'll save Judith,
and then Ben will leave too.

27:47.404 --> 27:48.449
That's what you want, right?

27:48.449 --> 27:50.712
You can't do this
on your own.

27:50.712 --> 27:52.192
I'll take my chances.

27:52.192 --> 27:55.674
Ziggy puts your chances
of succeeding alone at 10%.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.632
I'm a decorated
marine raider.

27:57.632 --> 28:00.374
I can handle a solo extraction
against a group of civilians.

28:00.374 --> 28:03.725
Martinez,
I have been in your shoes.

28:03.725 --> 28:05.684
I have been on the front lines.

28:05.684 --> 28:09.122
But the majority of my career
was spent in intelligence,

28:09.122 --> 28:12.734
gathering information,
anticipating scenarios,

28:12.734 --> 28:14.431
planning contingencies.

28:14.431 --> 28:17.130
- Kinda like Ziggy.
- Exactly like Ziggy.

28:17.130 --> 28:19.872
My Green Berets
were more than capable

28:19.872 --> 28:21.264
of brute force when required,

28:21.264 --> 28:24.006
but sometimes
the intelligence found

28:24.006 --> 28:27.836
that the path to success
lay in avoiding bloodshed.

28:27.836 --> 28:30.709
Sometimes we even worked
with known hostiles

28:30.709 --> 28:33.059
to achieve a shared objective.

28:45.767 --> 28:47.203
Addison!

28:47.203 --> 28:50.206
Addison, help me!

28:50.206 --> 28:52.818
No, no, no.

28:52.818 --> 28:54.384
No, no.
- O'Connor, calm down.

28:54.384 --> 28:55.516
Calm down.
Calm down.

28:55.516 --> 28:57.648
- No.
- Look, I have your treatment.

29:01.261 --> 29:03.219
- No!
- Calm down. Calm down.

29:03.219 --> 29:04.264
- No, no!
- It's OK. It's OK.

29:04.264 --> 29:05.787
- No!
- Calm down. Calm down.

29:16.406 --> 29:17.843
Martinez?

29:17.843 --> 29:20.323
Wait, you're helping me?
- For now.

29:20.323 --> 29:21.498
And you trust him?

29:23.065 --> 29:25.154
About as much
as he trusts us.

29:26.416 --> 29:27.461
Great.

29:35.208 --> 29:37.340
So what's the plan, Doc?

29:37.340 --> 29:38.559
This is your version
of helping me,

29:38.559 --> 29:39.778
you asking me for help?

29:39.778 --> 29:41.170
Well,
you sabotaged my first plan.

29:41.170 --> 29:43.738
Gentlemen, you're
working together, remember?

29:46.567 --> 29:47.611
OK?

29:47.611 --> 29:49.048
I tried
to call off the surgery

29:49.048 --> 29:50.092
and walk Judith out of there,

29:50.092 --> 29:51.833
but the nurses called my bluff.

29:51.833 --> 29:53.748
I was gonna fight my way
out of there,

29:53.748 --> 29:56.229
but Ziggy and your sweetheart
here claimed that's a bad call.

29:56.229 --> 29:58.709
Well,
now she's in there alone.

29:58.709 --> 30:00.320
What about
fighting our way back in?

30:00.320 --> 30:01.843
What does Ziggy say about that?
- No good.

30:01.843 --> 30:03.410
There's staff everywhere.

30:03.410 --> 30:05.151
By now, the doctor's probably
got her under the knife.

30:05.151 --> 30:07.370
One wrong move,
and he kills her.

30:16.989 --> 30:18.555
Follow my lead.

30:18.555 --> 30:20.906
Follow your lead?
What does that mean?

30:23.909 --> 30:26.041
Uh, hey, Ben,
what are you doing?

30:26.041 --> 30:28.827
- What happened to no force?
- Put that on.

30:28.827 --> 30:30.045
Are you crazy?

30:30.045 --> 30:31.917
Let's hope they think so.

30:34.093 --> 30:35.398
<i>Code red.</i>

30:35.398 --> 30:37.836
<i>Patient security breach.</i>

30:37.836 --> 30:39.489
Go!

30:39.489 --> 30:42.579
<i>Repeat, code red.
Patient security breach.</i>

30:42.579 --> 30:44.625
<i>All orderlies...</i>
- Stop!

30:46.235 --> 30:49.021
Let her go,
or I slit his throat.

30:49.021 --> 30:50.718
He's delusional, Doc.

30:50.718 --> 30:52.894
Keeps saying
he's from the future.

30:52.894 --> 30:55.375
Release her
or your friend dies,

30:55.375 --> 30:59.074
in three, two, one.

30:59.074 --> 31:00.380
OK, OK, OK.

31:01.990 --> 31:06.081
I'll let her go, but you
have to let Lawrence go too.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.214
OK?

31:08.214 --> 31:09.563
Yes?

31:14.611 --> 31:16.309
What are you doing?
Lawrence, no.

31:16.309 --> 31:18.006
No, no!

31:18.006 --> 31:20.313
No...

31:23.577 --> 31:25.187
Grab that folder.
It's on top of his desk.

31:25.187 --> 31:26.667
Put it in his bag.
I'll grab Judith.

31:31.585 --> 31:32.934
What's happening?

31:35.241 --> 31:36.764
O'Connor?

31:36.764 --> 31:38.853
We're gonna get you out
of here.

31:40.811 --> 31:42.204
- Behind you.
- No, no, no.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.814
It's OK.
He's with us.

31:43.814 --> 31:45.991
- Are you sure?
- Eh, fairly.

31:48.863 --> 31:51.387
Ziggy says the orderlies
are right behind you.

31:51.387 --> 31:53.824
Can you barricade that door?
- Yeah, OK.

31:58.525 --> 32:00.353
- OK, tunnels are that way.
- OK.

32:02.703 --> 32:04.705
They should be coming up.

32:04.705 --> 32:06.098
Turn left and just keep going.

32:06.098 --> 32:07.055
- This way?
- Yeah.

32:07.055 --> 32:09.014
- OK.
- Straight, straight.

32:11.799 --> 32:13.496
No.

32:13.496 --> 32:14.758
Wait. No, no.

32:14.758 --> 32:16.369
Wait.
This can't be right.

32:19.241 --> 32:20.808
- Above you.
- Huh?

32:25.030 --> 32:26.683
I'm on it.

32:42.917 --> 32:45.006
And Ziggy says the orderlies
just broke the barricade.

32:45.006 --> 32:46.921
They're gonna be here
any minute.

32:52.231 --> 32:53.754
Lock.

32:58.541 --> 33:00.413
Oh, thank God.

33:02.545 --> 33:04.373
All right, you're up.

33:04.373 --> 33:05.418
Elaine?

33:05.418 --> 33:07.072
Judith?

33:07.072 --> 33:08.725
Judith!

33:08.725 --> 33:10.336
Judith, come on.
I've got my car.

33:10.336 --> 33:11.554
The bridge is about to raise.

33:11.554 --> 33:13.513
Let's go. Let's go.

33:13.513 --> 33:14.862
Come on. Come on.
- All right, here.

33:14.862 --> 33:16.995
Wait.
Here's Dr. Mueller's files.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.213
It's for the police.

33:18.213 --> 33:19.780
OK.

33:19.780 --> 33:22.130
Thank you, both of you.

33:22.130 --> 33:23.566
Yeah, thank us
by getting out of here.

33:23.566 --> 33:24.567
- OK.
- Come on.

33:24.567 --> 33:26.134
- OK.
- You got it.

33:26.134 --> 33:28.528
You got it.
- OK.

33:37.145 --> 33:39.060
Thank you.

33:39.060 --> 33:40.801
Here I come.

33:42.324 --> 33:44.065
OK, good news.

33:44.065 --> 33:46.024
Ziggy said as soon
as they cross the bridge,

33:46.024 --> 33:47.155
you both are gonna leap.

33:47.155 --> 33:48.896
Not bad for a pacifist.

33:51.551 --> 33:53.770
Hey, thanks for your help.

33:53.770 --> 33:56.034
Yeah, don't get used to it.

33:56.034 --> 33:57.122
Huh?

33:58.297 --> 33:59.559
Aah!

33:59.559 --> 34:00.777
No!

34:00.777 --> 34:02.257
You're a threat
to my greater mission.

34:02.257 --> 34:05.565
My orders were to stop you
before we cross again.

34:05.565 --> 34:08.002
Goodbye, Ben.

34:23.800 --> 34:25.628
No.

34:25.628 --> 34:27.195
Ben.

34:27.195 --> 34:29.545
Let me see.

34:29.545 --> 34:31.417
Am I dying?

34:31.417 --> 34:33.201
If we can't stop
that bleeding, you will.

34:33.201 --> 34:34.637
How much longer
until Ben leaps?

34:34.637 --> 34:36.596
Well, not until Judith
and Elaine cross the bridge.

34:36.596 --> 34:39.207
And they're still at least
another five minutes out.

34:39.207 --> 34:40.556
Ben doesn't have
five minutes.

34:40.556 --> 34:42.210
His vitals are plummeting.
- Yeah.

34:42.210 --> 34:45.039
And when Liam O'Connor dies,
Ben dies for nothing.

34:46.214 --> 34:47.998
Let me talk to Addison.

34:51.915 --> 34:53.787
Not now, Ian.

34:53.787 --> 34:55.180
<i>Captain Augustine,</i>

34:55.180 --> 34:57.051
do you remember
what you told Martinez earlier?

34:59.009 --> 35:01.360
I'm losing him, Magic.

35:01.360 --> 35:04.014
I am losing him, and there's
nothing I can do about it.

35:04.014 --> 35:06.147
You're
an intelligence officer.

35:06.147 --> 35:07.583
You saved hundreds of lives

35:07.583 --> 35:09.324
<i>without being physically present.</i>

35:09.324 --> 35:11.674
<i>I believe you can
save another one today.</i>

35:14.199 --> 35:15.635
Yes, sir.

35:17.158 --> 35:19.117
OK, think.

35:19.117 --> 35:20.988
Think, Addison.

35:23.469 --> 35:26.167
Hey. Hey, I have an idea.

35:26.167 --> 35:28.169
OK, we are right
below a parking lot.

35:28.169 --> 35:30.128
I need you to climb that ladder

35:30.128 --> 35:32.478
and find a car
that you can get into.

35:32.478 --> 35:33.305
I can't.

35:33.305 --> 35:35.742
You can, and you will.

35:35.742 --> 35:37.700
You can do this, Ben.

35:37.700 --> 35:39.702
Come on! Climb!

35:45.230 --> 35:47.188
OK. Come on, Ben.

35:49.886 --> 35:51.105
Come on.

35:52.541 --> 35:55.196
Again. Again.

35:55.196 --> 35:57.024
He's doing it.
He's doing it.

35:57.024 --> 35:58.199
Ziggy says that Ben needs

35:58.199 --> 36:00.201
to last at least
another three minutes.

36:00.201 --> 36:01.681
He's overexerting himself.

36:01.681 --> 36:03.813
The more he moves,
the more blood he loses.

36:03.813 --> 36:04.988
You got a better idea?

36:04.988 --> 36:06.207
<i>Come on.</i>

36:07.426 --> 36:08.383
Again.

36:11.908 --> 36:13.562
Again.

36:13.562 --> 36:15.956
Yes. Yes.

36:15.956 --> 36:17.262
Yes.

36:22.092 --> 36:23.877
Ben, stay with me.

36:23.877 --> 36:25.052
Look at me.

36:25.052 --> 36:27.228
Hey. Hey, you see this lighter?

36:27.228 --> 36:28.447
I need you to push it down.

36:28.447 --> 36:30.144
Come on.

36:30.144 --> 36:32.233
There you go.

36:32.233 --> 36:34.322
OK, good job.

36:34.322 --> 36:35.715
All right.
You still have that rag?

36:35.715 --> 36:37.586
You're gonna
bite down on it, OK?

36:37.586 --> 36:40.241
And then you're gonna press
that lighter to your neck.

36:40.241 --> 36:43.244
I'm not gonna lie,
it's gonna hurt like hell.

36:43.244 --> 36:44.724
Come on. Come on.

36:44.724 --> 36:46.204
Come on!

36:53.994 --> 36:55.082
OK, let me see.

36:55.082 --> 36:57.650
OK, good job.

36:57.650 --> 37:00.174
Good job.

37:00.174 --> 37:01.610
Ziggy puts the leap out
at two minutes.

37:01.610 --> 37:04.134
Ben, hey,
you're gonna stay with me.

37:04.134 --> 37:05.353
You're gonna stay awake.

37:09.052 --> 37:10.750
In case
I don't get the chance...

37:10.750 --> 37:12.491
- Mm-mm.
- To remember...

37:12.491 --> 37:14.362
Mm-mm.

37:14.362 --> 37:17.844
Tell me about us,
you and me.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.284
Uh...

37:23.284 --> 37:25.939
There's no foods
that you dislike,

37:25.939 --> 37:29.203
and it drives me crazy.

37:29.203 --> 37:33.163
We both hate dancing,
except at weddings.

37:33.163 --> 37:36.428
And then we love it,
which totally works out.

37:36.428 --> 37:40.170
Um, the first time that you
told me that you loved me

37:40.170 --> 37:41.781
was at Griffith Observatory.

37:41.781 --> 37:43.435
No.

37:43.435 --> 37:48.135
I mean,
the first time I told you

37:48.135 --> 37:50.485
was at the observatory,

37:50.485 --> 37:53.271
but the first time I knew,

37:53.271 --> 37:54.750
it was way before that.

37:54.750 --> 37:57.057
I remember we were
pulling an all-nighter

37:57.057 --> 37:58.624
on the quantum accelerator.

37:58.624 --> 38:00.887
I remember.

38:00.887 --> 38:02.802
I stayed with you that night,

38:02.802 --> 38:05.631
talking about why
we both joined Quantum Leap.

38:05.631 --> 38:07.807
When Magic talked to me
about the project,

38:07.807 --> 38:10.984
I knew I had to join it.

38:10.984 --> 38:13.073
Righting wrongs that were made,

38:13.073 --> 38:16.424
sa--saving lives
that were lost.

38:18.513 --> 38:22.648
I couldn't imagine
a more honorable way

38:22.648 --> 38:26.260
to spend my life.

38:28.218 --> 38:30.351
Or a better man
to spend it with.

38:32.048 --> 38:34.268
No.

38:34.268 --> 38:36.009
Hey. Hey, Ben.

38:36.009 --> 38:37.358
No.

38:40.013 --> 38:41.841
No.

38:41.841 --> 38:43.016
Ben.

38:52.242 --> 38:54.419
Just stay with me, please.

39:04.646 --> 39:06.648
Ben--Ben, there are peop--

39:06.648 --> 39:08.346
Ben, there are people coming.

39:08.346 --> 39:10.435
Nurses.

39:10.435 --> 39:12.175
Ben, you have
to get their attention.

39:12.175 --> 39:15.091
Come on.
Honk the horn.

39:15.091 --> 39:17.267
Ben, honk the horn.

39:17.267 --> 39:19.444
Stay with me.
Honk the horn.

39:19.444 --> 39:20.706
Yes.

39:20.706 --> 39:22.621
Come on. Come on.

39:28.888 --> 39:31.412
What? Huh?
Whose car is that?

39:31.412 --> 39:33.414
Look! Hey, someone's inside!

39:34.154 --> 39:36.243
They're coming.

39:36.243 --> 39:38.680
They're coming, Ben.

39:51.606 --> 39:53.086
You should've
listened to me today.

39:53.086 --> 39:54.304
We almost lost everything.

39:54.304 --> 39:55.915
But we didn't.

39:55.915 --> 39:59.135
Judith moved in with her sister
and adopted a child.

39:59.135 --> 40:01.355
Liam O'Connor,
well, he survived

40:01.355 --> 40:04.358
to enjoy a long,
fruitful career as a PI.

40:04.358 --> 40:07.535
And Dr. Mueller
lost his medical license,

40:07.535 --> 40:09.929
ensuring he'd never harm
another patient again.

40:09.929 --> 40:13.585
More importantly, no lives
were lost in the process.

40:13.585 --> 40:16.283
Admiral,
do you seriously think

40:16.283 --> 40:18.633
we can win a war
without sacrifice?

40:19.547 --> 40:21.854
I don't know,
but we're damn well gonna try.

40:21.854 --> 40:25.423
You say you want us to tell you
more about what's happening.

40:25.423 --> 40:28.121
That cuts both ways.

40:28.121 --> 40:30.340
You're not telling me
everything you know.

40:30.340 --> 40:31.820
Why not?

40:36.695 --> 40:38.479
You know, you don't have
to smash something

40:38.479 --> 40:39.611
just to get my attention.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.482
Your phone
is connected to HQ,

40:41.482 --> 40:43.571
and they can't hear...

40:43.571 --> 40:46.748
I can't have them hear
what I'm about to tell you.

40:46.748 --> 40:47.706
Why not?

40:49.534 --> 40:51.797
Remember in Belize,
when I told Jenn

40:51.797 --> 40:53.494
that someone at Quantum Leap
couldn't be trusted?

40:53.494 --> 40:55.017
Yes,
but I didn't believe you.

40:57.237 --> 40:59.457
You say we have a mole
and you know who it is?

41:07.290 --> 41:08.727
Well, Ben never told me who.

41:08.727 --> 41:10.119
And I don't even know
if he knew,

41:10.119 --> 41:12.731
but it came to me today
after something Ian said.

41:17.562 --> 41:19.085
It's Ziggy.

41:21.174 --> 41:22.349
What?
