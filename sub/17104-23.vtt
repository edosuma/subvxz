TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:04.160 --> 00:06.040
-Can we go somewhere and talk?

00:06.080 --> 00:09.480
-I'm supposed to
be meeting-- Ethan!

00:09.519 --> 00:11.720
-Good for him.

00:11.759 --> 00:13.480
-I want to create my own work.

00:13.519 --> 00:15.320
Can't do that if I'm
standing in a corps du

00:15.359 --> 00:16.640
ballet for the next five years.

00:16.679 --> 00:17.800
-I've known you
since we were five

00:17.839 --> 00:19.440
and you have never
walked out of class.

00:19.480 --> 00:20.600
MALE SPEAKER: Kat?

00:20.640 --> 00:21.800
-Ex-best friend.

00:21.839 --> 00:23.199
Now frenemy.

00:23.239 --> 00:25.199
-Well, this guy, he's
closer than a brother.

00:25.239 --> 00:26.320
LAWYER: We need
Aaron to say he's

00:26.359 --> 00:27.679
the one who planned
the robbery, OK?

00:27.719 --> 00:29.600
He's the one who
brought the knife.

00:29.640 --> 00:30.559
-Hey stranger!

00:30.600 --> 00:31.519
-Have you seen Aaron?

00:31.559 --> 00:32.560
-Yeah, he's gone up north.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.359
-Our sentencing
hearing is next week.

00:34.399 --> 00:35.079
-Kaylah's right.

00:35.119 --> 00:35.840
You're running away.

00:35.880 --> 00:37.280
-What am I supposed to do?

00:37.320 --> 00:38.520
-Get some legal advice
and keep taking class

00:38.560 --> 00:39.799
so you can get a reference
from the Academy?

00:39.840 --> 00:41.640
-You know, you're like
a 40 year-old man.

00:41.679 --> 00:42.799
-[laughs]

00:42.840 --> 00:44.719
-Trapped in a geeky
16 year-old body.

00:52.240 --> 00:56.679
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh whoa.

00:56.719 --> 00:59.200
Whoa-oh whoa.

00:59.240 --> 01:06.159
Take a breath, close your eyes.

01:06.200 --> 01:14.120
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:14.159 --> 01:17.560
This is my chance,
this is my chance.

01:17.599 --> 01:21.560
My chance to feel alive.

01:21.599 --> 01:24.840
Whoa-oh whoa.

01:24.879 --> 01:27.480
Whoa-oh whoa.

01:35.840 --> 01:39.439
[music playing]

01:53.239 --> 01:56.439
TARA (VOICEOVER): I came home
from the first day of grade two

01:56.480 --> 01:58.120
with a new best friend.

01:58.159 --> 02:01.280
Layla Carter and I did
everything together.

02:01.319 --> 02:04.439
I gave her a pencil sharpener,
she gave me a friendship

02:04.480 --> 02:06.640
bracelet, we gave
each other nits.

02:10.479 --> 02:11.800
-OK, get ready everyone.

02:11.840 --> 02:14.240
Let's pick it up from the slide.

02:14.280 --> 02:17.800
And one, two, three, four.

02:17.840 --> 02:19.319
TARA (VOICEOVER):
The following year

02:19.360 --> 02:21.280
we were put in
different classes,

02:21.319 --> 02:23.639
and Layla met Ruby Simpson.

02:23.680 --> 02:29.240
Though she tried to deny it, I
knew she had a new best friend.

02:29.280 --> 02:31.400
Mum said it's
natural that people

02:31.439 --> 02:34.479
grow up, move in
different directions.

02:34.520 --> 02:37.199
Some friendships aren't
meant to last forever.

02:40.560 --> 02:43.400
PATRICK: Good work, guys.

02:43.439 --> 02:44.400
Great.

02:44.439 --> 02:45.759
See you tomorrow.

02:45.800 --> 02:48.240
-Hey, I'm scrounging
around for dancers.

02:48.280 --> 02:49.759
You have a sisterly obligation.

02:49.800 --> 02:51.039
You I just need.

02:51.080 --> 02:52.280
-I'll be there.

02:52.319 --> 02:53.639
-Are you gonna tell
us what it's for or--

02:53.680 --> 02:54.719
-Rehearsal room at six?

02:54.759 --> 02:55.599
-OK.

02:55.639 --> 02:56.800
-Hey.

02:56.840 --> 02:58.319
We need to practice
that last lift.

02:58.360 --> 03:00.199
-Sorry, I, I can't right now.

03:03.599 --> 03:04.719
-Ethan needs dance bodies.

03:04.759 --> 03:06.439
I don't think he's picky.

03:06.479 --> 03:07.080
-Clearly.

03:07.120 --> 03:09.800
He asked you.

03:09.840 --> 03:11.599
-Are you doing anything better?

03:11.639 --> 03:12.800
-No.

03:12.840 --> 03:13.840
-[laughs]

03:13.879 --> 03:15.240
-So I can come
with you tomorrow.

03:15.280 --> 03:17.319
And they've already
given me permission

03:17.360 --> 03:19.240
to go to court,
which basically means

03:19.280 --> 03:21.560
I'm by your side all week.

03:21.599 --> 03:24.719
-So if I wanted to go
to the bathroom say, uh,

03:24.759 --> 03:26.240
is that a group
activity or what?

03:26.280 --> 03:30.639
--[laughs] It's about keeping
your eye on the prize.

03:30.680 --> 03:32.599
Let me hear the magic words.

03:32.639 --> 03:34.280
-Suspended sentence.

03:34.319 --> 03:35.560
-Sorry, what was that?

03:35.599 --> 03:38.840
-Suspended sentence.

03:38.879 --> 03:39.800
-Oh, I gotta get home.

03:39.840 --> 03:41.120
Have to put on for Dad.

03:41.159 --> 03:42.280
Are you OK to say
here by yourself?

03:42.319 --> 03:44.719
-Sammy, I'll be fine.

03:44.759 --> 03:46.240
-OK.

03:46.280 --> 03:47.159
See ya.

03:57.879 --> 03:58.479
-Hey!

04:10.520 --> 04:11.080
Oof!

04:11.120 --> 04:11.599
-[laughs]

04:11.639 --> 04:12.319
-Aaron!

04:12.360 --> 04:13.080
-What, man?

04:13.120 --> 04:13.840
You miss me that much?

04:13.879 --> 04:14.759
-Hey, where have you been?

04:14.800 --> 04:15.840
I've been freaking out!

04:15.879 --> 04:17.160
-I've been in
Byron, up the coast.

04:17.199 --> 04:18.600
-Wait, our court
hearing is this Friday

04:18.639 --> 04:20.560
and you go on a surfing trip?

04:20.600 --> 04:22.160
-I, I got scared.

04:22.199 --> 04:27.399
I just got on a bus, and when
I started thinking again,

04:27.439 --> 04:28.759
one thing was pretty obvious.

04:28.800 --> 04:29.600
-What?

04:29.639 --> 04:30.480
That you'd get caught?

04:30.519 --> 04:31.759
-No.

04:31.800 --> 04:32.639
-No, don't you understand
how much worse it'd be?

04:32.680 --> 04:34.160
-No!

04:34.199 --> 04:36.480
I'd take my chances if
this was just about me.

04:36.519 --> 04:39.759
But I couldn't let
do this on your own.

04:39.800 --> 04:42.680
Come on, let's go for a surf.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.480
Come on, man.

04:47.519 --> 04:49.480
ETHAN: Thank you, all
of you, for coming.

04:49.519 --> 04:52.240
I know general consensus is that
I'm an idiot for turning down

04:52.279 --> 04:53.680
a contract with
the company, but--

04:53.720 --> 04:55.160
-Is this one of
those confessionals

04:55.199 --> 04:56.360
where you ask for help?

04:56.399 --> 04:58.800
-Uh, kind of. [laughs]
I've been applying

04:58.839 --> 05:01.120
for choreography positions.

05:01.160 --> 05:03.120
I just heard back
from Impresion.

05:03.160 --> 05:03.759
-Barcelona.

05:03.800 --> 05:05.120
ETHAN: Exactly.

05:05.160 --> 05:06.839
They've asked to see
some of my current work.

05:06.879 --> 05:07.800
-Oh wow!

05:07.839 --> 05:09.040
Ethan, that's incredible!

05:09.079 --> 05:10.199
ETHAN: It would
be an opportunity

05:10.240 --> 05:11.480
to be seen by one
of the world's most

05:11.519 --> 05:13.199
interesting
contemporary companies.

05:13.240 --> 05:15.639
Hopefully we can do
something really special.

05:15.680 --> 05:16.600
Let's gets started.

05:23.680 --> 05:25.480
That's great, everyone.

05:25.519 --> 05:28.600
Abigail, can I get
you to move downstage?

05:36.319 --> 05:38.319
Can you tell I'm excited?

05:38.360 --> 05:38.839
-Yeah.

05:38.879 --> 05:40.160
But Barcelona.

05:40.199 --> 05:41.759
You don't even like tapas.

05:41.800 --> 05:42.800
-It's an amazing workshop.

05:42.839 --> 05:44.639
And it's only for a year.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.120
-Then what?

05:46.160 --> 05:47.720
-Sell myself around Europe.

05:47.759 --> 05:49.360
Small experimental companies.

05:49.399 --> 05:50.439
Work my way up.

05:50.480 --> 05:51.480
-But you don't do poor.

05:51.519 --> 05:52.319
You don't do indie.

05:52.360 --> 05:53.680
You don't even do facial hair.

05:53.720 --> 05:55.199
-[laughs]

05:55.240 --> 05:56.199
-And there are heaps of
contemporary companies here.

05:56.240 --> 05:57.639
-Are you listening to yourself?

05:57.680 --> 05:58.839
You're trying to convince me
to stay when all you ever do

05:58.879 --> 06:00.439
is talk about
getting out of here.

06:12.519 --> 06:15.560
AARON: How many hours you think
we've spent out here, man?

06:15.600 --> 06:18.160
I don't know if I'm
gonna survive jail.

06:18.199 --> 06:20.160
-The Legal Aid guy said
that's not the case

06:20.199 --> 06:21.600
if we make a decent impression.

06:21.639 --> 06:22.600
-If you do.

06:25.839 --> 06:28.399
You're good kid at a
fancy ballet school.

06:28.439 --> 06:30.240
I'm the bad influence
who led you astray.

06:30.279 --> 06:32.800
-Look, I'm not gonna let them
put this all on you, all right?

06:32.839 --> 06:33.600
-I know, mate.

06:33.639 --> 06:34.639
But I'm 18.

06:34.680 --> 06:36.040
I'm the one who
brought the knife.

06:36.079 --> 06:37.319
They're just not
gonna let me out

06:37.360 --> 06:38.720
of this with a
slap on the wrist.

06:42.839 --> 06:46.040
So, you gonna shut up
and surf, or have you

06:46.079 --> 06:47.399
lost all your moves?

06:59.120 --> 07:01.360
-Can I pose you a hypothetical?

07:01.399 --> 07:02.600
-Why?

07:02.639 --> 07:05.199
-Limited options.

07:05.240 --> 07:08.160
OK, so say you
know someone that's

07:08.199 --> 07:10.480
about to throw away everything
that they've worked for.

07:10.519 --> 07:15.399
Do you think it's worse to
A, try and stop them, or B,

07:15.439 --> 07:17.720
let them make the biggest
mistake of their life?

07:17.759 --> 07:19.319
-If you want Ethan to stay--

07:19.360 --> 07:22.399
-Who says this is about Ethan?

07:22.439 --> 07:25.480
-All you have to do
is give him a reason.

07:25.519 --> 07:26.160
-Like?

07:30.839 --> 07:32.160
-Tara.

07:32.199 --> 07:34.399
Is always sneaking
things into my laundry.

07:34.439 --> 07:37.560
Can that girl seriously not
afford her own washing powder?

07:56.480 --> 08:00.319
-Who did this come from?

08:00.360 --> 08:03.480
-I thought it was
time we started over.

08:03.519 --> 08:06.800
And I wanted to express
that in flowers.

08:06.839 --> 08:07.800
-Really?

08:07.839 --> 08:10.079
-[laughs] No.

08:39.200 --> 08:41.639
-Does that look like a T to you?

08:41.679 --> 08:44.200
-Why would anyone be
communicating in flowers?

08:44.240 --> 08:46.159
-The better question
is why would anyone

08:46.200 --> 08:48.799
get anyone a gerbera?

08:48.840 --> 08:49.799
-I like gerberas.

08:49.840 --> 08:50.799
They're happy flowers.

08:50.840 --> 08:51.799
-No.

08:51.840 --> 08:53.120
Sunflowers are happy flowers.

08:53.159 --> 08:54.799
Gerberas are all
like, ooh, look at me.

08:54.840 --> 08:55.720
I'm a gerbera.

08:55.759 --> 08:56.799
So attention seeking.

08:56.840 --> 08:58.759
-Well obviously,
your secret admirer

08:58.799 --> 09:01.200
has a different
taste in botanicals.

09:01.240 --> 09:03.159
-You really think I
have a secret admirer?

09:10.840 --> 09:14.399
and confirm for me that it's
an accurate record of events?

09:14.440 --> 09:16.720
The plan is to make the case
that the robbery was out

09:16.759 --> 09:18.200
of character.

09:18.240 --> 09:20.159
-Christian has been a
model student all year.

09:20.200 --> 09:21.639
-I'll vouch for
that, if it helps.

09:21.679 --> 09:23.080
LAWYER: Yeah, sure.

09:23.120 --> 09:25.159
He's got no prior
convictions, so it was clear

09:25.200 --> 09:26.559
that he was led
astray by bad company.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.200
This should give the
judge good reason

09:28.240 --> 09:29.600
not to send him to
juvenile detention.

09:29.639 --> 09:33.480
-Sorry, I, I need to
change this statement.

09:33.519 --> 09:36.639
It says here that I didn't
know about the knife.

09:39.440 --> 09:41.399
I did know.

09:41.440 --> 09:42.759
It was mine.

09:42.799 --> 09:44.120
-Christian, what are you doing?

09:44.159 --> 09:45.600
SAMMY: There is no
way it was his knife.

09:45.639 --> 09:47.639
You told me you freaked
when Aaron pulled it.

09:47.679 --> 09:50.320
-I lied.

09:50.360 --> 09:50.639
I'm sorry.

09:55.639 --> 09:56.600
-Hey!

09:56.639 --> 09:58.399
Do you want to go to juvie?

09:58.440 --> 09:59.399
-You heard the guy.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.200
I'm a model citizen
with no priors.

10:01.240 --> 10:02.840
-The knife changes
everything, Christian!

10:02.879 --> 10:05.600
-I don't remember you
getting your law degree.

10:05.639 --> 10:06.639
-We, we were on track!

10:06.679 --> 10:08.480
I don't understand!

10:08.519 --> 10:09.799
CHRISTIAN: Done.

10:09.840 --> 10:10.399
-Sweet.

10:21.159 --> 10:23.559
[piano playing]

10:29.399 --> 10:30.279
-Thank you.

10:37.519 --> 10:38.159
Tara.

10:41.399 --> 10:43.279
I know we all wait
breathlessly to be kept up

10:43.320 --> 10:45.159
to date with your love
life, but perhaps this

10:45.200 --> 10:47.600
can be confined to
outside of class.

10:47.639 --> 10:48.440
-Yes, Miss Raine.

10:48.480 --> 10:49.799
Sorry.

10:49.840 --> 10:50.799
MISS RAINE: Girls, get
changed into your pointe shoes

10:50.840 --> 10:52.200
and come back into the center.

10:56.519 --> 10:59.399
-Aw, mystery boy's
inviting you on a picnic.

10:59.440 --> 11:00.120
How sweet.

11:00.159 --> 11:02.399
-How embarrassing.

11:02.440 --> 11:03.360
I'm not gonna go.

11:03.399 --> 11:05.320
Could be anyone.

11:05.360 --> 11:06.799
-If I tell you
something, you have

11:06.840 --> 11:08.200
to promise me that you won't go.

11:08.240 --> 11:09.720
You've already broken
his heart once.

11:09.759 --> 11:11.639
-Christian broke
my heart, remember?

11:11.679 --> 11:13.600
-I meant Ethan.

11:13.639 --> 11:14.600
-[laughs]

11:14.639 --> 11:15.519
-No, really.

11:15.559 --> 11:17.320
-What?

11:17.360 --> 11:18.679
Oh.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.840
-Yeah, we need a check before
we reach that point, OK?

11:20.879 --> 11:22.159
MALE STUDENT 1: Oh well,
I'll see him before then.

11:22.200 --> 11:22.799
MALE STUDENT 2: OK.

11:22.840 --> 11:23.639
6:30 Tomorrow.

11:23.679 --> 11:24.519
MALE STUDENT 1: Uh huh.

11:24.559 --> 11:25.840
-Just give me a sec.

11:25.879 --> 11:27.480
What have you got there?

11:27.519 --> 11:27.840
-What?

11:27.879 --> 11:28.799
Nothing.

11:28.840 --> 11:30.519
-Yeah, it's from my pigeonhole.

11:30.559 --> 11:31.799
Who's giving me gerberas?

11:31.840 --> 11:34.159
-Oh, some people like gerberas.

11:34.200 --> 11:36.600
And trust me when I tell you
you don't want to read this.

11:36.639 --> 11:37.799
-Kat.

11:37.840 --> 11:39.320
-I just thought that
she'd gotten over it.

11:39.360 --> 11:40.159
-Kat, give--

11:40.200 --> 11:41.399
-OK, OK, OK.

11:41.440 --> 11:42.799
Just pinky promise that
you won't do anything

11:42.840 --> 11:43.720
with this information.

11:46.279 --> 11:47.799
Tara told me that
breaking up with you

11:47.840 --> 11:49.440
was the biggest
mistake of her life.

11:59.120 --> 12:00.799
-Thanks for coming.

12:00.840 --> 12:01.799
Have you spoken to Aaron?

12:01.840 --> 12:03.200
You've gotta change his mind.

12:03.240 --> 12:06.639
-Where is he?

12:06.679 --> 12:09.320
[hip hop music playing]

12:20.159 --> 12:21.600
-Ballet boy!

12:21.639 --> 12:23.600
[music stops]

12:23.639 --> 12:25.039
-Not bad.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.399
Thought I might come check
out the famous Academy.

12:27.440 --> 12:29.639
Figured it was my last
chance, since you may not

12:29.679 --> 12:30.720
be here much longer.

12:30.759 --> 12:34.320
-You two friends now?

12:34.360 --> 12:35.639
SAMMY: I'll leave you to it.

12:38.639 --> 12:39.840
-He's a good mate.

12:39.879 --> 12:40.679
-What?

12:40.720 --> 12:41.799
Unlike Aaron?

12:41.840 --> 12:43.399
-You changed your life.

12:43.440 --> 12:46.679
He's doing the same old thing
with the same old people.

12:46.720 --> 12:50.240
-You should go home, Kaylah.

12:50.279 --> 12:52.639
-Is this what you
were trying to do?

12:52.679 --> 12:55.200
[hip hop music playing]

12:58.840 --> 13:02.039
-A whole year at this
fancy dance school, hey?

13:02.080 --> 13:03.480
Maybe I should audition.

13:36.240 --> 13:46.639
-"Some flowers for a flower."

13:46.679 --> 13:48.320
-You look nice.

13:51.679 --> 13:53.159
-Um, thanks.

13:53.200 --> 13:55.120
This, this is nice too.

13:55.159 --> 13:56.600
-Isn't it?

13:56.639 --> 13:57.559
Really nice.

14:03.840 --> 14:04.639
Shall I serve?

14:08.639 --> 14:09.360
Ow!

14:09.399 --> 14:10.200
Ow, ow, ow, ow!

14:10.240 --> 14:10.639
-What?

14:10.679 --> 14:11.799
What?

14:11.840 --> 14:12.799
-I think I just
got stung by a bee!

14:12.840 --> 14:14.440
-Where?

14:14.480 --> 14:15.279
Oh um, OK.

14:15.320 --> 14:16.600
Here, let me get you some ice.

14:16.639 --> 14:17.320
Here.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.440
ETHAN: Oh!

14:18.480 --> 14:19.720
-Um, let me-- sorry.

14:19.759 --> 14:20.480
-Tara!

14:20.519 --> 14:21.159
TARA: Oh, sorry.

14:21.200 --> 14:21.639
Let me just--

14:21.679 --> 14:22.279
[bonk]

14:22.320 --> 14:22.600
-Ow!

14:22.639 --> 14:23.600
-Ow!

14:23.639 --> 14:24.480
What are you trying to do to me?

14:24.519 --> 14:25.240
-I don't know.

14:25.279 --> 14:26.320
Why are we even here?

14:26.360 --> 14:26.840
-You tell me.

14:26.879 --> 14:27.720
You invited me.

14:27.759 --> 14:28.519
-No, I didn't.

14:28.559 --> 14:29.639
You invited me.

14:32.639 --> 14:33.240
Kat.

14:33.279 --> 14:33.600
-Kat.

14:36.360 --> 14:38.639
-Can't believe you were coming
here to let me down gently.

14:38.679 --> 14:41.519
-I was planning to say we
work better as friends.

14:41.559 --> 14:42.919
-How is that gentle?

14:42.960 --> 14:44.840
At least I was gonna pull
out the long distance card!

14:44.879 --> 14:46.679
-[laughs]

14:46.720 --> 14:49.480
-So do you?

14:49.519 --> 14:52.159
-So do I what?

14:52.200 --> 14:54.360
-Only like me as a friend.

14:54.399 --> 14:56.159
-Sure, I like you as a friend.

15:00.360 --> 15:01.120
-No.

15:01.159 --> 15:02.519
You like me more than that.

15:02.559 --> 15:03.679
-Oh, really?

15:03.720 --> 15:07.120
-Don't I smell like
Christmas or something?

15:07.159 --> 15:08.600
[laughs] Ow, ow!

15:23.879 --> 15:25.799
-Aaron!

15:25.840 --> 15:26.720
-Ah, dance school.

15:26.759 --> 15:28.200
Cheddar's mate.

15:28.240 --> 15:30.200
-Thought I'd give
you the heads up.

15:30.240 --> 15:31.799
Christian's lawyer
convinced him to stick

15:31.840 --> 15:34.360
with his original
story, so you should

15:34.399 --> 15:35.639
tell the truth about the knife.

15:35.679 --> 15:38.320
-Uh, and Christian sent
you here to tell me this?

15:38.360 --> 15:39.399
-He's busy.

15:39.440 --> 15:40.039
Getting ready for
court and, you know.

15:40.080 --> 15:41.159
-And what?

15:41.200 --> 15:42.440
And polishing his
shoes? [laughs]

15:42.480 --> 15:45.200
You don't know him
at all, do you?

15:45.240 --> 15:47.639
-I know he's not a coward.

15:47.679 --> 15:49.120
And I know he's loyal.

15:49.159 --> 15:52.039
I mean, that's what you're
relying on, isn't it?

15:52.080 --> 15:54.480
You can't ask him
to lie for you.

15:54.519 --> 15:56.120
-Mates don't have to ask.

16:02.200 --> 16:04.240
-I knew you'd always end
up in a place like this.

16:04.279 --> 16:07.360
-It could have just
as easily been you.

16:07.399 --> 16:09.120
-No.

16:09.159 --> 16:11.120
It's like you got
this thing around you.

16:11.159 --> 16:13.600
Like a light or something.

16:13.639 --> 16:16.679
You gotta stop feeling
guilty for getting chances.

16:27.519 --> 16:28.759
I mean, I love him too.

16:28.799 --> 16:30.240
But you don't owe him this.

16:39.120 --> 16:41.440
-Well, I just had the
best date of my life.

16:41.480 --> 16:42.639
-Really?

16:42.679 --> 16:44.240
Huh, who would've thought?

16:44.279 --> 16:46.200
-Well, at first it
was a little awkward.

16:46.240 --> 16:51.320
But Tara and I together,
with the flowers.

16:51.360 --> 16:53.200
She admitted she still
has feelings for me

16:53.240 --> 16:55.840
and I realize I haven't
gotten over her either.

16:55.879 --> 16:58.159
-Mm hmm.

16:58.200 --> 17:01.240
-So we're running away together.

17:01.279 --> 17:02.320
-Right.

17:02.360 --> 17:04.400
-Did you just want
to embarrass me one

17:04.440 --> 17:06.039
last time before going overseas?

17:06.079 --> 17:07.839
Like your version of
a goodbye present?

17:07.880 --> 17:08.720
-No, I just--

17:08.759 --> 17:09.598
-You just what, Kat?

17:09.640 --> 17:10.559
Tell me!

17:10.598 --> 17:11.559
You have my full attention!

17:11.598 --> 17:13.839
-Can we rain check the lecture?

17:13.880 --> 17:18.640
You can yell at me as much as
you like, just not right now!

17:18.680 --> 17:20.319
[knocking]

17:20.358 --> 17:23.799
-T, uh, I shouldn't be telling
you this, but I need your help.

17:23.839 --> 17:24.598
-Yeah, of course.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.799
Anything.

17:26.839 --> 17:29.799
-It's about Christian.

17:29.839 --> 17:31.640
-Then you should talk to Kaylah.

17:31.680 --> 17:34.359
Seems like she's all over it.

17:34.400 --> 17:36.559
-You have no idea what
you're talking about.

17:46.680 --> 17:48.240
-Why didn't you tell me?

17:48.279 --> 17:52.200
You know everything about me,
every stupid little thing!

17:52.240 --> 17:53.480
-You knew about Aaron.

17:53.519 --> 17:55.200
-You let me think
it was shoplifting!

17:55.240 --> 17:57.720
I didn't know about the
knife or the criminal record!

17:57.759 --> 17:59.079
How could you not tell me that?

17:59.119 --> 18:00.400
-What do you want to know, Tara?

18:00.440 --> 18:02.400
You want to know that we
robbed a service station?

18:02.440 --> 18:05.440
That we scared the guy so
much he hasn't worked since?

18:05.480 --> 18:07.480
Do you want to know
that when my mom died,

18:07.519 --> 18:09.519
I slept on Aaron's
couch every night?

18:09.559 --> 18:11.799
That he was the only
person that gave a crap?

18:11.839 --> 18:13.359
-Christian.

18:13.400 --> 18:14.880
-Maybe you want to know that
every member of my family

18:14.920 --> 18:18.519
has screwed up their lives, and
I'm probably gonna do the same?

18:18.559 --> 18:21.079
Is that the kind of stuff
you want to know, Tara?

18:26.799 --> 18:28.559
You don't know me.

18:28.599 --> 18:32.319
And if you're honest,
you don't want to.

19:01.559 --> 19:03.160
-Wow.

19:03.200 --> 19:06.319
Haven't seen you do that many
since your cat got run over.

19:06.359 --> 19:07.400
-Poor Fred.

19:07.440 --> 19:08.640
He had no road sense.

19:16.160 --> 19:17.599
-So do you need to
talk about it or--

19:17.640 --> 19:18.559
-Hm mm.

19:18.599 --> 19:19.640
No.

19:19.680 --> 19:23.400
I prefer to express
it in cupcake.

19:23.440 --> 19:30.440
But since you asked, I am just
sick of everybody leaving me.

19:30.480 --> 19:32.440
You know, I get that
I'm not enough to keep

19:32.480 --> 19:33.279
my parents around.

19:33.319 --> 19:34.759
I do.

19:34.799 --> 19:37.440
But I just thought that Ethan
might stay for a little bit

19:37.480 --> 19:39.200
longer.

19:39.240 --> 19:43.599
-OK, you have got to stop
feeling sorry for yourself.

19:43.640 --> 19:45.720
Remember all those years ago?

19:45.759 --> 19:47.759
The postcards you sent me?

19:47.799 --> 19:49.599
Amazing places, but you
said that you couldn't

19:49.640 --> 19:52.119
wait to get back to junior
school so that we could be--

19:52.160 --> 19:53.720
-Best friends forever?

19:53.759 --> 19:55.759
-Then you decided
you were a rebel

19:55.799 --> 19:58.599
and I was a Betty Bunhead.

19:58.640 --> 20:00.599
-Well, we grew up.

20:00.640 --> 20:04.000
Became different people.

20:04.039 --> 20:05.759
-Yeah.

20:05.799 --> 20:08.559
But you still left me.

20:08.599 --> 20:10.519
Not the other way around.

20:20.400 --> 20:21.359
SAMMY: Here.

20:27.640 --> 20:29.240
-You're not gonna
try and stop me?

20:32.599 --> 20:35.480
-Will it make a difference?

20:35.519 --> 20:36.119
-No.

20:41.200 --> 20:43.160
-I'll admit it
wasn't my best plan.

20:43.200 --> 20:46.119
-At the start of the year,
you were diabolically opposed

20:46.160 --> 20:48.599
to me dating Ethan.

20:48.640 --> 20:49.359
-People change.

20:59.240 --> 21:01.680
-Hey, why aren't you ready?

21:01.720 --> 21:03.200
-He doesn't want me there.

21:03.240 --> 21:05.400
And I don't know
what I'd say to him.

21:09.720 --> 21:13.759
-After this is over,
it's Indonesia.

21:13.799 --> 21:15.279
You, me, surf.

21:15.319 --> 21:16.400
-What?

21:16.440 --> 21:18.720
You don't want to go
back to ballet land?

21:18.759 --> 21:22.279
-I don't think they'll let me
back in if I've been in juvie.

21:22.319 --> 21:25.119
-But with the references
and everything,

21:25.160 --> 21:27.119
even if you say
you took the knife,

21:27.160 --> 21:29.440
you're still gonna get a
suspended sentence, right?

21:29.480 --> 21:30.200
-Yeah, yeah.

21:30.240 --> 21:31.720
I'm, I'm just saying.

21:31.759 --> 21:32.720
Worst case scenario.

21:36.599 --> 21:38.799
PATRICK: Find the connection.

21:38.839 --> 21:41.759
Trust your partner.

21:41.799 --> 21:45.359
Be there for them every time.

21:45.400 --> 21:45.680
-Ow!

21:48.799 --> 21:49.559
-Tara?

21:49.599 --> 21:50.440
Are you with us?

22:00.039 --> 22:04.240
-They've uh, [clears throat]
they've called us in.

22:04.279 --> 22:07.359
CHRISTIAN: Sammy, wait.

22:07.400 --> 22:08.720
Thanks.

22:08.759 --> 22:09.720
For everything.

22:13.279 --> 22:15.359
No one's really tried
that hard for me before.

22:22.400 --> 22:23.720
-Check it out.

22:30.480 --> 22:33.319
-Christian?

22:33.359 --> 22:34.039
It's time.

22:38.359 --> 22:40.599
-Hey, hey, hey.

22:40.640 --> 22:42.279
I'm gonna tell
the judge that I'm

22:42.319 --> 22:43.599
the one who brought the knife.

22:43.640 --> 22:44.640
-Aaron, what are you--

22:44.680 --> 22:46.279
-We're not gonna
argue about this.

22:46.319 --> 22:51.319
Just tell the truth, yeah?

22:51.359 --> 22:53.440
I don't want you
on my conscience.

23:00.799 --> 23:03.359
TARA (VOICEOVER): My dad
says if, when you die,

23:03.400 --> 23:05.759
you can count your true
friends on one hand,

23:05.799 --> 23:07.680
then you're beyond lucky.

23:07.720 --> 23:09.759
-Let me hear those magic words.

23:09.799 --> 23:11.599
-Suspended sentence.

23:11.640 --> 23:12.559
-Suspended sentence!

23:18.200 --> 23:22.519
-I don't know how he's gonna
cope in there for six months.

23:22.559 --> 23:24.680
-I'll come visit him with you.

23:24.720 --> 23:26.200
-You realize no
matter what happens,

23:26.240 --> 23:29.480
I'm always gonna be
your brother, right?

23:29.519 --> 23:33.279
Plus, Barcelona knocked
me back anyway, so.

23:33.319 --> 23:33.599
-What?

23:37.319 --> 23:38.759
They're idiots.

23:38.799 --> 23:40.240
-What are you thinking about?

23:43.480 --> 23:44.119
-The future.

Carters will come and go.

it doesn't matter

23:51.119 --> 23:52.640

23:52.680 --> 23:57.000
And it doesn't matter how many
times you push each other away.

23:57.039 --> 23:59.559
When it counts, you
just have to be there.

24:03.759 --> 24:03.880
