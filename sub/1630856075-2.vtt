WEBVTT

00:04.713 --> 00:08.633
-All rise.
-You know, let's not do that today, okay?

00:08.717 --> 00:11.094
But protocol. I have a list here.

00:11.177 --> 00:13.430
[chuckles]
You know, protocol's really Betty's thing.

00:13.513 --> 00:19.310
Um, if I recall, you were the one who
came up with the "all rise" thing, sir.

00:19.394 --> 00:20.395
It's a vivid memory.

00:20.478 --> 00:22.772
You know,
you actually looked a lot younger then.

00:22.856 --> 00:25.316
Edie, why don't you take a seat
next to Noel down there for today, okay?

00:26.234 --> 00:27.235
Okay.

00:27.318 --> 00:30.071
All right.
Everybody, sit, sit, sit, sit, sit.

00:30.155 --> 00:31.656
Listen. Real special day today,

00:31.740 --> 00:34.701
'cause we're transitioning
to include the family in the business.

00:34.784 --> 00:37.037
-Mm-hmm.
-So my family's gonna be joining us

00:37.120 --> 00:38.288
here at the big meetings.

00:38.371 --> 00:39.998
You know Cal. Of course Mrs. Claus.

00:40.081 --> 00:42.167
-Sandra is…
-Just doing Sandra things.

00:42.250 --> 00:44.377
Sandra is just doing Sandra things
right now,

00:44.461 --> 00:45.754
but we have some big news.

00:45.837 --> 00:48.214
Let's start with Mrs. Claus.

00:48.298 --> 00:52.594
Okay. Um, as you all know,
I have taken over the E.L.F.S.,

00:52.677 --> 00:55.305
and we are on the case
of the missing nutcracker.

00:55.388 --> 00:58.975
[chuckles] I mean,
who needs a nutcracker really?

00:59.059 --> 00:59.893
[both chuckle]

00:59.976 --> 01:01.686
[Scott] I'm with you, Edie. A nutcracker?

01:01.770 --> 01:04.064
Just get a spare shoe. Boom.
Nut is cracked.

01:04.147 --> 01:04.981
[Carol inhales]

01:05.065 --> 01:06.566
I think, more interesting is,

01:06.649 --> 01:11.071
we should be looking into those missing
pages of The Book of Santa Lore.

01:11.738 --> 01:16.785
Some mystery Santa Claus
called "Magnus Anthill."

01:16.868 --> 01:18.953
-No, no, no. It's, uh-- [stutters]
-Magnus Antas.

01:19.037 --> 01:20.663
-[elves gasp]
-Shh.

01:21.956 --> 01:23.374
I just like being right.

01:23.458 --> 01:26.044
-Huh. Missing pages.
-Yeah.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.337
Maybe it's somehow connected.

01:27.420 --> 01:29.005
-To the nutcracker?
-Yeah.

01:29.923 --> 01:31.216
Well, i-it could be. Listen.

01:31.299 --> 01:36.137
Bigger news, though, is Cal's training
to be the next Santa starts today.

01:36.221 --> 01:39.390
-[gasps] Whoo-hoo! Go, Cal! Whoo!
-[elves groan]

01:40.183 --> 01:42.060
In order to do the job,
you gotta look the part,

01:42.143 --> 01:44.729
so the elves and I made you
a training vest.

01:45.772 --> 01:48.775
Give it a shot. Look at this.
Try it on there. There you go.

01:49.818 --> 01:51.152
Awesome! [chuckles]

01:51.236 --> 01:52.570
I feel like a Girl Scout.

01:53.446 --> 01:54.864
-Well, w-w-- Okay.
-Yeah.

01:54.948 --> 01:58.076
And some of the fabric in that
came out of Saint Nicholas's coat,

01:58.159 --> 01:59.828
-so it's full of magic.
-[elves gasp]

01:59.911 --> 02:01.371
And this needs to be respected, Son.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.665
[sighs]
I like how it's a vest instead of a coat.

02:03.748 --> 02:06.042
Really shows off your arms. [whistles]

02:06.126 --> 02:07.293
[elves groaning]

02:09.587 --> 02:11.881
Uh, thanks again, Dad,
for letting Riley stay.

02:11.965 --> 02:15.385
No, it's great. As long as it doesn't
interfere with what we do around here.

02:15.468 --> 02:16.678
No, no. It-It won't.

02:19.472 --> 02:21.015
See? They're-They're-- They're good.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.226
Okay. Well, let's get to it.

02:24.602 --> 02:25.603
[arrow whistles]

02:29.732 --> 02:30.859
[Cupid] How about this one?

02:30.942 --> 02:33.570
What do you call a jalapeño
that went to medical school?

02:33.653 --> 02:35.864
-Doctor Pepper.
-[chuckles]

02:35.947 --> 02:37.907
That's hysterical.
Tip your waitresses, everybody.

02:37.991 --> 02:41.661
Listen. This-- These jokes are great,
but w-why did you fly to the North Pole?

02:41.744 --> 02:44.414
I mean, did-did-did I forget
Valentine's Day or something?

02:44.497 --> 02:45.957
What are you up to?

02:46.040 --> 02:48.376
Take it easy.
I'm not spying on you, all right?

02:48.459 --> 02:49.419
Well, why are you here?

02:49.502 --> 02:50.795
Again, not spying.

02:50.879 --> 02:54.382
Let me preface this by saying
don't shoot the messenger.

02:54.966 --> 02:58.887
Some of the Legendaries,
uh, Mother Nature, Easter Bunny, Sandman--

02:58.970 --> 03:03.141
Okay, all of them are a little concerned
about your son being the next Santa.

03:03.808 --> 03:05.310
How did they know about that?

03:05.393 --> 03:06.644
I told them. I'm spying on you.

03:06.728 --> 03:09.898
I thought the deal was we don't interfere
in each other's business.

03:09.981 --> 03:12.734
Yeah, that was until
you left us in the dark all last year.

03:12.817 --> 03:15.278
You retired too soon,
chose the wrong successor,

03:15.361 --> 03:17.197
and then came back and got rid of him.

03:17.280 --> 03:18.823
Like a hero.

03:18.907 --> 03:21.993
[steam hissing]

03:23.494 --> 03:25.288
Sorry, Dad. Riley needed a pick-me-up.
[chuckles]

03:25.371 --> 03:27.582
Where is the thermostat?
It is so cold here.

03:27.665 --> 03:28.791
Guys, I'm having a meeting.

03:29.417 --> 03:30.835
-[sighs]
-Oh! Sorry, Dad.

03:30.919 --> 03:32.337
And sorry, Mr. Cupid. [chuckles]

03:32.420 --> 03:35.340
-Aw, you're such a little baby.
-Am not.

03:35.423 --> 03:38.968
Aw. [gasps] Peekaboo! [gasps]

03:39.052 --> 03:42.639
-Peekaboo! Peekaboo! Aw. [chuckles]
-[giggles]

03:43.973 --> 03:45.892
-Guys.
-Sorry. Yeah.

03:46.476 --> 03:47.560
Well, that was humiliating.

03:47.644 --> 03:49.062
-Ooh, what's that?
-Isn't it cool?

03:49.145 --> 03:51.689
You don't happen to have an arrow
that stops love, do ya?

03:51.773 --> 03:53.441
Ah, life just does that.

03:53.524 --> 03:55.944
Plus there's nothing I can do
for these two. That's first love.

03:56.027 --> 03:58.446
No magic can overcome first love.

03:59.030 --> 04:00.823
I'm just worried about Cal.

04:00.907 --> 04:02.784
And despite all the things you've heard,

04:03.368 --> 04:06.204
I really believe that Cal has
what it takes to be the next Santa.

04:06.287 --> 04:09.415
That's tough, because I really
only deal in romantic love.

04:09.499 --> 04:11.626
Plus, as you know, I can't have kids.

04:11.709 --> 04:13.002
How would I know that?

04:13.086 --> 04:17.298
Although, I have observed that
nothing will break the heart like family.

04:17.382 --> 04:19.801
Right. Family. My family, my business.

04:19.884 --> 04:22.095
I don't think there's any reason
for you guys to step in there

04:22.178 --> 04:23.179
and start pointing fingers.

04:23.263 --> 04:25.056
-You know, I could do the same.
-Could not.

04:25.139 --> 04:26.140
-Could too.
-Really?

04:26.224 --> 04:27.934
Does Mrs. Cupid know that it took,

04:28.017 --> 04:30.478
like, five and a half arrows
to get her attention?

04:31.354 --> 04:32.647
Okay, I'll talk to the others.

04:32.730 --> 04:33.773
Get 'em to calm down.

04:33.856 --> 04:37.860
But if Cal's not Santa material
in three months, we're meddling.

04:37.944 --> 04:39.445
W-W-Wait, before you go-- [stammers]

04:39.529 --> 04:44.284
Have you heard of a old--
a previous Santa called, uh, "Magi Agi"?

04:44.367 --> 04:46.327
No, no. Um, "Magnus Angina."

04:46.411 --> 04:48.955
-Magnus Antas?
-Yes.

04:49.038 --> 04:50.039
Never heard of him.

04:50.123 --> 04:51.708
You just said his name.

04:51.791 --> 04:54.752
Truth be told, all you Santas look alike.

04:54.836 --> 04:58.548
Yeah. Well, fly home safe,
or run into something cold and sharp.

04:59.424 --> 05:01.259
-[theme playing]
-[choir harmonizing]

05:04.470 --> 05:05.972
[harmonizing continues]

05:08.057 --> 05:09.309
["Jingle Bells" plays]

05:14.105 --> 05:16.316
[Edie] Santa asking about
the missing book pages.

05:16.399 --> 05:18.067
Mrs. Claus looking for the nutcracker.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.486
When they find out
they're both looking for the Mad Santa,

05:20.570 --> 05:21.738
they're gonna be so mad.

05:21.821 --> 05:24.073
And then we'll have another Mad Santa.
The cycle repeats.

05:24.157 --> 05:25.366
Get ahold of yourself!

05:25.450 --> 05:27.869
[gasps] Um, did you just shake me?

05:27.952 --> 05:32.206
Yes, which is bad 'cause I'm usually
the shooken, not the shaker.

05:32.290 --> 05:34.250
-[Edie breathes shakily]
-Relax, Edie.

05:34.334 --> 05:37.754
It would take an insane amount of magic
to get him out of the nutcracker.

05:37.837 --> 05:41.174
Good. Because if Mad Santa ever gets free,

05:41.257 --> 05:43.634
he'll unleash his fury on the world.

05:44.552 --> 05:48.931
[Mad Santa chuckles]
So you're telling me, with this slab,

05:49.015 --> 05:52.602
I can communicate with others,
take self-etchings,

05:53.144 --> 05:56.356
and order gruel and herring
at the same time?

05:56.439 --> 05:58.775
-What a wonderful world this is.

06:07.700 --> 06:08.785
Oh, this is incredible.

06:08.868 --> 06:12.372
I-I can't believe I'm standing here
singing with the real Santa Claus.

06:12.455 --> 06:14.874
-Magnus Antas.
-[stammers] Yeah.

06:14.957 --> 06:20.505
But we're friends now, so you may call me
the Magnificent Magnus Antas.

06:20.588 --> 06:23.800
[stammers] I notice that you have a little
more movement in your arms and legs.

06:25.051 --> 06:27.804
You think maybe I--
I can get that hug now?

06:28.805 --> 06:30.181
[sighs] Approach.

06:43.611 --> 06:45.238
No, no. She's a gnome. [grunts]

06:45.321 --> 06:47.532
Gnome?
Since when does Santa Claus have gnomes?

06:47.615 --> 06:49.742
I-I invested all this money in elf ears.

[Mad Santa groans]

06:57.041 --> 06:58.042
Scott.

06:58.126 --> 07:01.712
Did you notice the elves acting weird
when the nutcracker was mentioned?

07:02.380 --> 07:04.966
900-year-olds that look like kids
with pointy ears.

07:05.049 --> 07:06.592
What's not weird about that?

07:06.676 --> 07:11.639
[chuckles] I've said it before, the
constant secrecy around here is bonkers.

07:11.722 --> 07:13.057
Yeah, I hear what you're saying.

07:13.141 --> 07:16.394
'Cause I'm still looking for
that beautiful red sweater that I have

07:16.477 --> 07:17.979
that says,
"I see you when you're sleeping."

07:18.062 --> 07:20.940
And the elves,
they don't know what happened to it.

07:21.023 --> 07:23.359
Oh. Yeah. That's weird.

07:24.819 --> 07:27.363
You know what else is weird,
is wh-what's with our daughter?

07:27.447 --> 07:29.449
I'm doing all this work
to keep the family together,

07:29.532 --> 07:31.784
kind of hard without the family together.

07:31.868 --> 07:33.995
She's going through some changes.

07:34.078 --> 07:36.622
She's discovered
that she has extraordinary powers.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.624
That's daunting. I've been through it.

07:39.250 --> 07:42.295
It requires self-reflection and listening.

07:42.378 --> 07:44.881
Yeah,
those are definitely your superpowers.

07:44.964 --> 07:46.299
I'll have a chat with her.

07:46.382 --> 07:52.847
I think that her problems may be
less magical and more biological.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.516
[chuckles] Puberty.

07:56.684 --> 07:59.604
-You talk to her.
-You can't go to a teenage girl.

07:59.687 --> 08:01.731
You have to let them come to you.

08:23.002 --> 08:25.630

08:25.713 --> 08:27.131
[gasps] Ooh.

08:27.215 --> 08:28.883
I was so frustrated.

08:28.966 --> 08:31.802
To be honest, ever since animals realized
that I can understand them,

08:31.886 --> 08:33.679
it's been a lot.

08:33.763 --> 08:38.184
Yes, if they have a sympathetic ear,
they never stop with the yakety-yakking.

08:38.684 --> 08:40.811
Except, funny enough, yaks.

08:40.895 --> 08:42.063
They don't have much to say.

08:42.146 --> 08:44.232
But I can help you with the animals.

08:44.315 --> 08:47.068
It's weird because,
well, Cal and I both have magic, right?

08:47.151 --> 08:49.195
But he got the fancy Santa powers,

08:49.278 --> 08:51.572
-and I'm stuck with whatever this is.
-[La Befana] Mmm.

08:51.656 --> 08:54.742
The North Pole is otherworldly.

08:54.825 --> 08:56.869
Full of magical beings.

08:56.953 --> 09:00.540
Not just Santa magic. All kinds.

09:01.123 --> 09:03.918
I am not the only witch
who has called this home.

09:05.419 --> 09:07.171
And when I look at you…

09:08.047 --> 09:09.048
Wait.

09:10.258 --> 09:13.386
Are you saying that I might be a witch?

09:13.469 --> 09:17.682
Well, you are very pretty,
but there is still time.

09:17.765 --> 09:20.017
Your wart is coming in.

09:20.101 --> 09:23.813
I think it is a nose one.

09:23.896 --> 09:25.606
-I don't see it. I'm--
-Just like mine.

09:25.690 --> 09:26.941
-It is, like, cute.
-No.

09:27.024 --> 09:29.694
-And we are like twins with warts.
-No. It's not cute, and we are not twins.

09:29.777 --> 09:30.945
-No?
-Because that is a freckle.

09:31.028 --> 09:32.029
-That is a freckle.
-Oh.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.782
You know what?
Maybe I'm like a Sugar Plum Fairy.

09:34.865 --> 09:36.993
Like something more Christmassy?

09:37.076 --> 09:40.288
You are a human born at the North Pole.

09:40.371 --> 09:42.123
Who knows how this could develop?

09:42.623 --> 09:46.836
But tell me what happened with your hand.

09:47.587 --> 09:49.547
I-I was really annoyed.

09:49.630 --> 09:52.508
And I had
all of these bottled-up feelings,

09:52.592 --> 09:55.886
and I wanted to get them out,
so I went like this.

09:56.470 --> 09:58.055
[sighs] Like--

09:59.557 --> 10:02.143
[groans]
Now I look like a stupid, dumb dummy!

10:03.477 --> 10:04.645
Oh.

10:06.856 --> 10:09.775
So it only happens when you are mad.

10:09.859 --> 10:13.863
This is not good.
It is very Italian, but it is not good.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.114
But I can help you.

10:15.197 --> 10:16.449
Do your parents know?

10:16.532 --> 10:20.911
No. If it's not free or has nothing
to do with Christmas, my dad won't get it.

10:20.995 --> 10:25.082
Okay. I cannot help you
if they don't know that I'm helping you.

10:25.166 --> 10:26.667
Your papa is a Santa.

10:26.751 --> 10:29.003
He's more cordial to me
than those of the past.

10:29.086 --> 10:30.671
I would like to keep it that way.

10:30.755 --> 10:32.590
Fine. I will tell them.

10:32.673 --> 10:33.841
Just for you.

10:34.634 --> 10:36.344
[speaking Italian]

10:39.513 --> 10:41.432
And don't worry, I will clean up.

10:43.934 --> 10:44.935
[rumbling]

10:47.271 --> 10:49.940
[panting, sighs]

10:50.775 --> 10:51.817
Nice.

10:52.777 --> 10:54.945
[grunting]

10:57.198 --> 10:59.450
[gasps, chuckles]

11:02.662 --> 11:03.663
[hums]

11:06.499 --> 11:08.584
-[gasps, grunts]
-[screams]

11:08.668 --> 11:10.711
Wh-What are you doing in my house?

11:10.795 --> 11:12.171
[grunts] I'm s-- I'm s--

11:13.005 --> 11:17.426
-[alarm blaring]
-Who takes cookies from a pregnant woman?

11:17.510 --> 11:20.554
-[Cal grunting]
-[Scott] Stop. Stop. Stop.

11:20.638 --> 11:22.682
Congratulations. You're dead.

11:22.765 --> 11:24.433
Okay, the entry was not bad.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.852
But you went right to eating
one of the cookies.

11:26.936 --> 11:28.813
You save the cookies till the end,
all right?

11:28.896 --> 11:31.399
-Oh.
-And why were you wrestling with the tree?

11:31.482 --> 11:33.734
That's a fleetwood pine.
Very noncombative.

11:33.818 --> 11:35.820
Just try to get along with the tree, okay?

11:35.903 --> 11:37.613
We got three months
to work this thing out.

11:37.697 --> 11:39.907
Wait, wait, wait. What about--
What about three months? What?

11:39.990 --> 11:41.242
Never mind.

11:41.325 --> 11:42.910
[gasps] You did awesome, Floofy.

11:43.494 --> 11:44.787
-Thanks, Floofy.
-[chuckles]

11:45.454 --> 11:46.831
-Floofy?
-Oh, yeah.

11:46.914 --> 11:48.916
That's our nickname for each other.
Isn't it so cute?

11:48.999 --> 11:51.335
I don't know.
Uh, why don't you ask the real Floofy?

11:54.505 --> 11:57.425
All right. I wanna reset this, okay?
Load it up again, guys.

11:57.508 --> 11:58.759
All right. We're gonna do it again.

12:00.136 --> 12:02.763
[chuckles] "Elfstorations." Oh, man.

12:02.847 --> 12:04.640
Hey, Kris. Why's the museum closed?

12:04.724 --> 12:08.769
My snow globe actually turned into a Santa
and a gnome from the 14th century.

12:08.853 --> 12:10.855
Now I gotta go find 'em
some pickled goat leg.

12:10.938 --> 12:11.981
You know how it is.

12:12.064 --> 12:14.275
Kris, if you need to talk,
I'll be around, okay?

12:14.358 --> 12:16.026
Uh, you know I'd love to stay and chat,

12:16.110 --> 12:18.946
but I promised I'd hurry back so,
uh, gotta run.

12:19.029 --> 12:21.782
[laughs] Oh, man.
Could my day get any better?

12:22.450 --> 12:25.327
Oh, boy. I do not want to have
to start looking for another job.

12:26.537 --> 12:29.582
[growls] It's time to go to war.

12:29.665 --> 12:31.333
Take back what was taken from us.

12:31.417 --> 12:32.585
Kill everyone!

12:32.668 --> 12:35.087
Or… no.

12:35.171 --> 12:36.005
[scoffs]

12:36.088 --> 12:40.760
The murder, the hostility, the revenge,
it all just seems like a lot, Olga.

12:41.385 --> 12:43.179
I'm happy. I'm free.

12:43.262 --> 12:44.930
I'm comfortable.

12:45.639 --> 12:48.851
I was a-a nutcracker for seven centuries.

12:48.934 --> 12:50.978
Where's the Santa I used to know?

12:51.061 --> 12:53.105
Your motto used to be "churn and burn."

12:53.189 --> 12:55.524
I was overtired. I was overworked.

12:56.108 --> 12:59.361
That 700-year nap, it hit the spot.

12:59.445 --> 13:02.573
And this Kris fellow,
he seems like a pleasant soul.

13:02.656 --> 13:05.910
In his dwelling, I have not seen one club,
one guillotine.

13:05.993 --> 13:08.662
We have to think that people have changed.

13:08.746 --> 13:12.750
Have you not learned anything from
those reality dating shows he watches?

13:12.833 --> 13:13.709
Hmm.

13:13.793 --> 13:15.461
People never change.

13:15.544 --> 13:17.505
Well, you'll just have to give it time.

13:18.088 --> 13:19.840
[scoffs] I'm not here to make friends.

13:19.924 --> 13:23.969
Open your mind to the possibility
that humanity has evolved

13:24.053 --> 13:26.013
and there's no more animosity.

13:26.096 --> 13:29.433
Listen to yourself!
You're getting soft like a wet cashew.

13:29.517 --> 13:31.519
What about those who wronged us?

13:31.602 --> 13:34.271
Sometimes you just have to let things go.

13:35.815 --> 13:39.819
Oh. [chuckles]
Look, I got the feeling back into my arms.

13:40.820 --> 13:42.404
[grunts] Okay.

13:42.488 --> 13:44.156
[groans, coughs]

13:44.240 --> 13:45.324
Deserved it.

13:46.075 --> 13:47.076
[sighs]

13:50.079 --> 13:51.664
-[Sandra] Dad?
-Hi.

13:51.747 --> 13:55.125
Um,
I'm sorry I missed the meeting earlier.

13:55.209 --> 13:57.336
I'm just going through stuff.

13:57.419 --> 13:59.588
Um, I know-- I know you are. Ar-Are you?

14:00.506 --> 14:03.175
I-I think you are.
I mean, I'm just glad you're better.

14:03.259 --> 14:04.343
Thank you.

14:04.426 --> 14:07.096
Um,
can I hang out with La Befana for a bit?

14:07.179 --> 14:08.681
That would be very kind of you.

14:08.764 --> 14:10.474
She could probably use company right now.

14:10.558 --> 14:13.936
It must be difficult having people be
scared of you all the time, right?

14:14.019 --> 14:15.396
Scared?

14:15.479 --> 14:17.189
I-It's not-not her fault.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.942
-I mean, she's a good one.
-A good one?

14:20.025 --> 14:21.402
She's a witch.

14:21.485 --> 14:22.987
[gasps] Really? I didn't know that.

14:23.070 --> 14:24.405
Well, it happens to all of them.

14:24.488 --> 14:26.824
Them? Who is them?

14:26.907 --> 14:28.576
God, you're so judgmental.

14:32.955 --> 14:34.290
C-C-Carol.

14:35.666 --> 14:36.667
[pings]

14:37.293 --> 14:40.170
Gary, I was checking old security footage.

14:40.963 --> 14:41.964
Uh-oh.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.216
Yeah. "Uh-oh."

14:44.300 --> 14:47.261
All of the cameras are pointed
at La Befana's cabin.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.513
And she hasn't done anything.

14:49.597 --> 14:52.016
[scoffs] What about crimes of the heart?

14:52.099 --> 14:55.227
Gary, it was one date, 200 years ago.

14:55.311 --> 14:56.478
You have to get over it.

14:57.313 --> 15:01.358
Hey, any luck convincing the old E.L.F.S.
to come back?

15:01.442 --> 15:04.278
They all said
it was a toxic work environment.

15:04.820 --> 15:06.030
Go figure.

15:08.657 --> 15:09.825
-Mmm.
-Mom?

15:11.160 --> 15:13.495
There she is. Hi.

15:13.579 --> 15:15.915
If you ever need to talk about anything,
I'm here.

15:15.998 --> 15:19.335
-Female stuff. Believe it or not, I--
-Gary! Please.

15:19.418 --> 15:21.629
No, I just feel like we should hang out,
you know?

15:21.712 --> 15:22.755
[clattering]

15:23.756 --> 15:25.758
-Mmm. Sounds fun.
-Yeah.

15:25.841 --> 15:27.843
What do you think of La Befana?

15:28.427 --> 15:29.762
-Well, actually--
-Hey.

15:30.262 --> 15:34.475
I have tremendous respect
for any woman who isn't defined by a man.

15:34.558 --> 15:36.685
-I mean, it's The Befana, right?
-Right. Mm-hmm.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.020
It's not Mrs. Befana.

15:38.771 --> 15:41.523
Okay. So, sister solidarity aside,
what do you think of her?

15:41.607 --> 15:43.859
Well, I think she's kooky.
[chuckles] Really sweet.

15:44.652 --> 15:47.237
Like kooky-- How d--
How do you mean kooky?

15:47.321 --> 15:50.866
She's a witch. It's nothing but spiders
and cobwebs up there, literally.

15:52.409 --> 15:55.454
You and Dad are the same.
What is wrong with you?

15:55.537 --> 15:57.289
Hey, no, no, no. Sandra?

15:57.373 --> 16:00.876
Hey. What did I say?
I know what you're going through!

16:01.377 --> 16:02.378
-[sighs]
-[door slams]

16:03.712 --> 16:04.713
Scott!

16:07.675 --> 16:10.970
Now lift the owl feather with your mind.

16:12.930 --> 16:14.098
[La Befana gasps]

16:15.057 --> 16:16.725
[speaking Italian]

16:17.977 --> 16:20.688
-That was amazing. Oh, my gosh.
-[chuckles]

16:20.771 --> 16:22.773
Now, the plant.

16:30.656 --> 16:32.074
Mamma mia!

16:33.575 --> 16:35.703
-[sighs]
-Here we go again.

16:35.786 --> 16:37.746
I don't know why this keeps happening.

16:37.830 --> 16:40.082
Magic takes focus.

16:40.165 --> 16:43.752
There must be something on your mind
because you are all loopy boopy.

16:43.836 --> 16:45.504
No idea what you're talking about.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.674
You know, I can see your thoughts.

16:53.679 --> 16:57.516
Fine. I meant to tell my parents,
but they don't get it.

16:57.599 --> 17:00.227
[chuckles] You know,
I can't really see your thoughts,

17:00.310 --> 17:02.521
but part of being a good witch
is to trick people.

17:03.147 --> 17:05.899
You have to tell them,
or I can't teach you.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.862
And if you don't get help
controlling your powers,

17:09.945 --> 17:12.072
there's no telling where this might lead.

17:12.156 --> 17:13.657
Okay. I have it under control.

17:14.241 --> 17:15.242
Ooh.

17:16.285 --> 17:19.204
[sighs, stammers]
I don't have it under control. [mutters]

17:19.288 --> 17:22.833
You know,
that was one of my favorite hats.

17:22.916 --> 17:23.917
[softly] I'm so sorry.

17:25.711 --> 17:27.463
Shoot. Lost again.

17:28.088 --> 17:29.673
Good game, Gary.

17:29.757 --> 17:33.385
Did you complete the analysis on the hair
we found on the nutcracker safe?

17:33.469 --> 17:35.137
Yes. You were right.

17:36.263 --> 17:37.347
It's hair.

17:38.599 --> 17:39.683
Whose is it?

17:40.309 --> 17:44.438
They asked me if I wanted to know that,
and I said don't bother.

17:52.196 --> 17:53.781
I'll send it back.

17:54.990 --> 17:56.158
Oh, my God.

18:01.330 --> 18:04.124
Okay, listen,
in order to be a perfect future Santa,

18:04.208 --> 18:06.794
you gotta learn from the Santas
that came before you.

18:06.877 --> 18:09.421
But didn't you only do that last month?

18:10.255 --> 18:11.256
God, I miss Betty.

18:12.174 --> 18:15.010
-Let's just get to the history.
-Uh, right. Okay.

18:15.094 --> 18:16.804
Well, what we know as Santa,

18:16.887 --> 18:19.681
all began with Saint Nicholas
honoring the birth of Jesus.

18:19.765 --> 18:21.183
Which is a perfect place to start.

18:21.266 --> 18:23.852
But let's move ahead
to the "Magnus Cum Laude."

18:23.936 --> 18:26.105
Or the-- You know, the-- the guy.

18:27.481 --> 18:29.525
Uh, right.

18:29.608 --> 18:33.737
Well, like most Santas before him,
Magnus Antas was based in Europe.

18:33.821 --> 18:39.034
Times were tough and humans tried to take
advantage of both Christmas and elf magic.

18:39.118 --> 18:43.122
So, Magnus Antas moved the operation
to a place where magic flourished

18:43.205 --> 18:44.790
without threat from the outside.

18:44.873 --> 18:46.291
The journey there was arduous.

18:46.375 --> 18:49.294
It was a giant magic snowball.
It was so fun.

18:49.378 --> 18:52.548
Magnus Antas invited elves
from all over the world

18:52.631 --> 18:55.217
but made treaties
with the others inhabiting these parts.

18:55.300 --> 18:57.302
Witches, fairies,

18:58.595 --> 18:59.847
gnomes.

19:01.306 --> 19:03.016
He built a utopia.

19:03.100 --> 19:04.935
Which is when I first came here
and met Betty.

19:05.018 --> 19:06.103
Ooh, I wanna hear about that.

19:06.186 --> 19:07.688
We're not here
to talk about you and Betty.

19:07.771 --> 19:08.897
I'd like to hear about it too.

19:08.981 --> 19:11.483
It all started in the 12th century.

19:11.567 --> 19:12.901
It was day.

19:12.985 --> 19:14.278
No. Night.

19:14.361 --> 19:16.196
No. Day.

19:17.281 --> 19:19.950
Anyone ever notice how it's hard to tell
what time it is here?

19:23.620 --> 19:25.497
A new snowball's arriving today.

19:25.581 --> 19:27.833
Wanna see if there's
any handsome elves? [chuckles]

19:27.916 --> 19:30.252
[sighs] Edie,
this is how you always get in trouble.

19:32.296 --> 19:34.089
[Edie gasps] Oh, my gosh.
They're already here.

19:34.173 --> 19:38.510
Wow. This place is amazing.
I'm gonna be so happy living here.

19:38.594 --> 19:39.803
Not me.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.848
This looks like a place
to make a quick fortune and move on.

19:45.225 --> 19:50.689
Sucker. Rube. Mark. Soup. Chump.

19:50.772 --> 19:54.193
Hey, toots. You know where I can find
a nice bath and a cot?

19:54.276 --> 19:55.527
Are you talking to me?

19:55.611 --> 19:58.906
I'm not Toots. He's the Head Elf.
And it's pronounced Toots.

19:58.989 --> 20:01.450
Oh. You just look like
you should be the Head Elf.

20:03.785 --> 20:07.789
Head Elf? Me? [chuckles]

20:07.873 --> 20:09.917
[Mad Santa]
Order me another grouse of legs.

20:10.000 --> 20:12.628
Here comes Toots now,
with the Great One himself.

20:12.711 --> 20:16.256
I'm thinking about changing my greeting
from "wanga-banga-langa"

20:16.340 --> 20:18.508
to a simple "ho ho ho."

20:19.176 --> 20:21.178
Genius. What a day.

20:21.261 --> 20:23.722
First, going to a bigger belt buckle,
and now this.

20:23.805 --> 20:25.474
Mmm. Yes.

20:25.557 --> 20:29.019
I see you staring at my belt buckle.
What are your thoughts? Too garish?

20:29.102 --> 20:30.520
It's spectacular, sir.

20:30.604 --> 20:33.315
Mmm. Thank you, um…

20:33.398 --> 20:34.775
Betty.

20:34.858 --> 20:36.151
-B-B-Betty?
-[Betty] Betty.

20:36.235 --> 20:37.945
-Betty.
-I got it right. Right, Betty?

20:38.028 --> 20:38.946
-Betty.
-Betty.

20:39.029 --> 20:39.863
Betty.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.490
Let's go, Toots.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.824
[Toots] It's Toots.

20:42.908 --> 20:44.660
Do not correct me, please.

20:44.743 --> 20:46.078
[sighs] Let's get out of here.

20:46.161 --> 20:47.663
[gasps] Go to the tavern.

20:47.746 --> 20:48.747
You two play darts?

20:48.830 --> 20:51.041
Never tried, but sounds fun.

20:51.124 --> 20:53.001
I'm gonna finish this job.

20:53.085 --> 20:54.544
I'm gonna stay behind too.

20:55.629 --> 20:56.630
Suit yourself.

20:57.673 --> 21:00.092
Keep an eye on her.
She's terrible at darts.

21:00.175 --> 21:02.177
[Edie scoffs] I never miss.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.180
My name's Noel. At least it was.

21:05.264 --> 21:08.767
[chuckles] Let me guess.
Processing center shortened it to Noel?

21:08.850 --> 21:11.270
-Yeah.
-I used to be Bethina. [chuckles]

21:12.688 --> 21:13.772
[Noel gasps]

21:17.150 --> 21:21.947
[gasps] After a whirlwind 200-year
courtship, Betty and I made it official.

21:22.614 --> 21:25.158
-We left on our honeymoon.
-Honeymoon, yeah. [chuckles]

21:25.242 --> 21:27.828
That is the greatest love story
I've ever heard.

21:27.911 --> 21:29.079
Next to ours.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.622
We're like Romeo and Juliet.

21:31.206 --> 21:32.416
And boy, that ended well.

21:33.166 --> 21:35.544
Wait a minute. Betty told me
she never left the North Pole.

21:35.627 --> 21:38.171
She gets confused sometimes.

21:38.255 --> 21:41.758
The point is,
by the time we returned to the North Pole,

21:41.842 --> 21:44.970
the Magnus Antas reign was over.
Which is why I don't know how it ended.

21:46.346 --> 21:48.724
Me too. I was gone too.

21:48.807 --> 21:52.394
You know what's really amazing is
I've never heard of him before.

21:52.477 --> 21:55.856
When I was in the Yule-verse,
I-I don't remember meeting him.

21:55.939 --> 21:59.151
Uh, well, I'm sure he was there.
He was just, uh, very…

21:59.234 --> 22:02.070
-Quiet. Quiet.
-Quiet. And unassuming. [chuckles]

22:02.154 --> 22:04.614
Yes, it is me, Magnus Antas!

22:04.698 --> 22:06.950
Bask in my glow!

22:07.034 --> 22:09.703
You're welcome. You're welcome! [chuckles]

22:09.786 --> 22:11.663
Blessed are ye! You're welcome.

22:12.539 --> 22:14.541
W-Where did you get
all the figs and walnuts?

22:14.624 --> 22:16.710
Do not question the Great One,
you peasant.

22:16.793 --> 22:21.048
Okay. Okay. But-But now that I'm
with the real Santa, how'd I do?

22:21.131 --> 22:22.924
How close is this to the real North Pole?

22:23.008 --> 22:25.802
Well, instead of reindeer, you have goats.

22:25.886 --> 22:28.722
That's the only difference?
[scoffs] Winning.

22:28.805 --> 22:32.225
It's enchanting.
Is-Is the rest of the world like this now?

22:32.309 --> 22:34.728
Well, if it was, I wouldn't have to build
this place, now, would I?

22:34.811 --> 22:35.979
Ah, yes. Ah.

22:36.063 --> 22:39.066
-[grunts] There you are. You're welcome.
-[Santapolis guest] Hey!

22:39.900 --> 22:41.735
[snarls] Elves.

22:41.818 --> 22:47.532
So, this Magnus Antas was the first Santa
to close the North Pole to outsiders.

22:47.616 --> 22:50.494
Sounds like a-- a very, very wise Santa.

22:50.577 --> 22:53.288
He was something. Really something.

22:53.372 --> 22:55.791
Well,
these old Santas really raised the bar.

22:55.874 --> 22:58.585
So we're gonna have to double down
on your training.

22:58.668 --> 23:02.464
[clicks tongue] Oh. You're already
number one in my book, Floofy.

23:02.547 --> 23:05.967
-[sighs]
-Yeah. Get your head in the game, Floofy.

23:06.551 --> 23:08.136
You think he bought it?

23:08.220 --> 23:12.057
Hopefully no one ever spills the beans
about what really happened.

23:14.976 --> 23:16.770
Betty, let's get out of here.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.814
I'm working. I'll be home soon.

23:18.897 --> 23:22.150
No. Out of here, out of here.
Before it's too late.

23:22.234 --> 23:26.279
Edie, Gary, Crouton, Pontoon,
they're all going.

23:26.863 --> 23:28.782
There's nothing here for us anymore.

23:28.865 --> 23:31.701
Ever since Santa started listening to
the gnomes and went mad.

23:31.785 --> 23:33.328
There's Christmas.

23:34.329 --> 23:35.539
Our purpose.

23:36.248 --> 23:39.876
What else do we have? Where would we go?

23:39.960 --> 23:42.879
I'd rather stay and fight for what we have
than run away.

23:42.963 --> 23:45.298
Who's running away?

23:46.299 --> 23:49.511
Don't I give you everything?

23:49.594 --> 23:53.682
You're just like everyone else
in the world, always wanting more.

23:54.558 --> 23:56.810
Well, no one's leaving here. Ever.

23:56.893 --> 23:57.894
[exclaims, shivers]

23:57.978 --> 24:00.897
I thought we were here
to keep the world out, not to keep us in.

24:00.981 --> 24:02.774
What's the difference?

24:02.858 --> 24:03.859
Olga!

24:05.694 --> 24:07.696
Take them away! Roughly!

24:09.114 --> 24:11.241
Don't listen to the gnomes, Santa!

24:11.324 --> 24:15.245
Their tongues are as untrustworthy
as their unnaturally round ears!

24:16.079 --> 24:18.039
Don't worry about it. It's fine.

24:18.582 --> 24:22.502
Can't we get, like, a wooden throne
or something? [shivers]

24:22.586 --> 24:27.007
N-Nope, never mind.
The ice sets a tone. Sets a tone.

24:27.966 --> 24:29.801
Well, will you look at that?

24:29.885 --> 24:34.764
I was the first Santa to say "ho ho ho",
and they're still using it today.

24:34.848 --> 24:35.849
I matter.

24:36.641 --> 24:37.726
You're not Santa.

24:37.809 --> 24:39.269
Oh, really?

24:39.352 --> 24:43.732
Then I guess
you don't want these figs and walnuts?

24:43.815 --> 24:46.067
-[Mad Santa chuckles]
-I want Roblox.

24:46.151 --> 24:49.654
Who is this Roblox they keep speaking of?
Is he another Santa?

24:49.738 --> 24:52.532
What did he invent?
Certainly not good manners!

24:52.616 --> 24:55.785
[chuckles]
Roblox is actually online gaming.

24:55.869 --> 24:58.288
It's really, really hard to explain.

24:58.371 --> 25:02.125
But, yeah, kids aren't always grateful
for simple pleasures these days.

25:02.209 --> 25:03.335
Parents too.

25:03.418 --> 25:06.713
What more do they want?
They have miracles in their hands.

25:06.796 --> 25:07.631
Mom!

25:07.714 --> 25:09.341
-[Kris] I know. We try to give 'em…
-Let's go.

25:09.424 --> 25:12.177
…an escape from it all,
but doesn't always work.

25:12.260 --> 25:14.179
I will cane all of you!

25:14.804 --> 25:16.681
-Cute.
-Ew!

25:16.765 --> 25:18.433
What? No.

25:20.519 --> 25:22.312
No! No! No!

25:22.395 --> 25:24.314
It's "ho ho ho," fake Santa.

25:24.397 --> 25:26.149
You little scalawag!

25:26.233 --> 25:29.110
If I had my amulet,
I'd turn you into Roblox!

25:29.194 --> 25:30.195
Assuming that's bad.

25:30.278 --> 25:32.239
It would be bad to turn him into a Roblox.

25:32.322 --> 25:33.740
Good.

25:33.823 --> 25:37.035
That's what I'd turn him into then.
A Roblox.

25:37.577 --> 25:38.912
[growls]

25:39.454 --> 25:43.375
It says here that the first artifacts
went missing decades ago,

25:43.458 --> 25:48.797
and that each case was investigated by you
and declared unsolvable.

25:48.880 --> 25:50.257
[gulps] Let me see that.

25:51.258 --> 25:52.551
[electricity crackles]

25:52.634 --> 25:54.511
Hey! What'd you do?

25:55.262 --> 25:58.056
Sometimes electrical equipment shorts out
around me.

25:58.139 --> 26:00.016
It's the darnedest thing.

26:00.100 --> 26:02.143
You should have that checked out.

26:02.227 --> 26:03.728
[Gary] I'll add that to my list.

26:09.109 --> 26:10.110
Hey!

26:11.486 --> 26:15.031
[gasps] "Hide nutcracker evidence."

26:15.115 --> 26:16.116
I didn't write that.

26:16.199 --> 26:19.160
I don't know anything about Magnus Antas
being trapped as a nutcracker.

26:21.329 --> 26:22.622
Wait.

26:22.706 --> 26:25.000
I'm not saying another word
without my lawyer present.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.626
Who's your lawyer?

26:26.710 --> 26:28.712
I represent myself.

26:29.212 --> 26:31.047
And I've been disbarred.

26:31.548 --> 26:33.174
Oh, good. You're home.

26:34.801 --> 26:37.887
Today was horrible.
I'm under so much pressure.

26:37.971 --> 26:40.307
But I think I got everyone
off the Mad Santa track.

26:41.766 --> 26:45.520
You're right. Where are my manners?
How was your day?

26:45.604 --> 26:48.189
-[horns honking]
-[techno music playing on speakers]

26:51.276 --> 26:52.277
[shutter clicks]

26:55.822 --> 26:58.450
Hey, Sandra. Sandra, hold on.
Come in here a minute.

27:00.076 --> 27:02.954
So, um-- So what's-- what's going on?

27:03.038 --> 27:06.833
Nothing. Just normal, regular girl stuff.

27:06.916 --> 27:08.043
Yeah.

27:08.793 --> 27:10.503
Wait a second. L-Listen, listen.

27:10.587 --> 27:11.588
[sighs]

27:11.671 --> 27:17.093
I realize that I've been spending a-a lot
of time with Cal, and it's-it's not fair.

27:18.136 --> 27:23.725
And you have every right to be upset
that one day Cal's gonna be Santa Claus.

27:23.808 --> 27:27.145
Oh. No. I mean-- Well, yeah.

27:27.228 --> 27:30.106
Yeah, I guess I was a little at first,
but seriously, it's cool.

27:30.190 --> 27:32.984
Yeah, well, he's got a lot of powers
that need to be dealt with, okay?

27:33.068 --> 27:36.071
And so do you.
And I want you part of this whole thing.

27:38.531 --> 27:40.492
There's no Christmas without you, honey.

27:43.036 --> 27:44.245
-[sighs]
-Hey, hey, hey.

27:44.329 --> 27:48.041
Uh, I-- I don't think I can finish
all this ice cream by myself.

27:48.124 --> 27:50.210
[chuckles] Pretty sure you can.

27:50.960 --> 27:53.963
Probably, but, hey, grab a spoon.

27:54.047 --> 27:55.090
[sighs]

28:01.012 --> 28:03.640
Elves bells! [chuckling]
How did you do that?

28:04.724 --> 28:06.101
[sighs]

28:06.184 --> 28:09.145
Dad… [sighs]
…I have to tell you something.

28:10.271 --> 28:13.692
I think I'm becoming a witch.

28:15.735 --> 28:20.198
Look, my powers have been getting stronger
ever since we got back to the North Pole.

28:20.281 --> 28:22.742
And La Befana says
it's because of Christmas spirit.

28:22.826 --> 28:23.993
La Befana?

28:24.577 --> 28:26.121
We've been training together.

28:27.580 --> 28:30.667
I'm really sorry
that I didn't just come to you. [chuckles]

28:30.750 --> 28:31.793
So that's it?

28:34.671 --> 28:37.674
-[sighs]
-Yeah. You-You're not mad?

28:37.757 --> 28:41.428
[clicks tongue] Am I mad? Well, who am I?

28:41.511 --> 28:42.762
Santa Claus.

28:42.846 --> 28:44.848
And where do we live?

28:44.931 --> 28:45.932
The North Pole.

28:46.015 --> 28:47.934
Are you okay? Do I need to call someone?

28:48.017 --> 28:50.478
Our family isn't normal.

28:50.562 --> 28:52.230
We're all full of magic.

28:52.981 --> 28:58.361
And you'd have to do a lot worse
than becoming a witch to scare me.

28:58.445 --> 29:02.615
[chuckles] You are so much more
than a witch, my dear.

29:03.366 --> 29:05.201
You're a Claus.

29:05.285 --> 29:08.788
And many other things,
but mostly you're a Claus.

29:09.372 --> 29:11.958
[chuckles] You're the best, Dad.

29:13.209 --> 29:14.377
Okay. [chuckles]

29:14.961 --> 29:17.088
I'm gonna eat this by myself then.

29:17.172 --> 29:18.339
Hi, Mom. Bye, Mom.

29:18.423 --> 29:19.507
Hey. What?

29:20.967 --> 29:23.011
She's so happy. What is that?

29:23.094 --> 29:25.472
Oh, we had a nice conversation.

29:25.555 --> 29:28.057
It's not about puberty. She's a witch.

29:28.141 --> 29:29.851
-Oh. Oh!
-[chuckles]

29:29.934 --> 29:31.811
I should go talk to her.

29:31.895 --> 29:33.772
-No. No. I'm gonna let her come to me.
-Ah.

29:33.855 --> 29:35.023
-I was right.
-About?

29:35.106 --> 29:37.817
About the missing pages from your book
and the nutcracker. Yes.

29:37.901 --> 29:39.611
Right, right. Okay. Go. Go.

29:39.694 --> 29:41.946
-It all traces back to Magnus Antas.
-Of course.

29:42.030 --> 29:44.115
Somehow, he got turned into a nutcracker.

29:44.199 --> 29:46.743
-Could that happen to any Santa?
-I guess.

29:46.826 --> 29:50.079
And then Gary sold it on the black market
to pay for his gambling debts.

29:50.163 --> 29:52.665
Gary loves to play the My Little Ponies.

29:52.749 --> 29:55.710
Mmm, yeah. And the elves are being
really cagey about it.

29:56.294 --> 29:58.379
Is that something for us to worry about?

29:59.088 --> 30:00.131
I don't know.

30:04.093 --> 30:09.265
[grunts] Oh, after 700 years,
people are only getting worse!

30:09.349 --> 30:13.561
And now this new Santa wants to reward
them with magic!

30:13.645 --> 30:16.105
Magic! [sighs]

30:16.189 --> 30:18.483
-What's that on your back?
-What?

30:18.566 --> 30:21.444
"Jingle bells. Santa smells"!

30:21.528 --> 30:24.906
Oh! That's it.
I tried to play nice, but no more.

30:24.989 --> 30:27.951
We are going to take back the North Pole,

30:28.034 --> 30:32.705
and when we end this weak Santa,
the whole world will pay!

30:46.469 --> 30:49.055
-Let's get some rest. Okay?
-[grunts]

30:49.138 --> 30:50.139
-Sorry.
-[grunts]

30:50.223 --> 30:53.601
After seven centuries,
it's the only way I can sleep.

30:53.685 --> 30:55.687
[cackling]

30:59.607 --> 31:01.192
All right. All right!

31:01.276 --> 31:04.737
If you're gonna sleep on my back,
I need you to be quiet.

31:04.821 --> 31:07.365
-[scoffs]
-Let's do one more together. Here we go.

31:07.448 --> 31:10.326
-[both cackle]
-And we're done.

31:10.410 --> 31:13.746
[both snoring]
