03:03.616 --> 03:05.918
Hello, there.

03:05.920 --> 03:07.452
Welcome.

03:14.861 --> 03:18.363
Mr. Grollman,
let me introduce
the Mandelbaums.

03:18.365 --> 03:20.699
Good morning.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.935
Please come in.

03:22.937 --> 03:26.238
-Take a seat, please.
-Sit over there.

03:26.240 --> 03:28.507
Richard Grollman.

03:28.509 --> 03:30.709
-Pleasure.
-Thank you.

03:30.711 --> 03:33.979
Mr. and Mrs. Mandelbaum.

03:33.981 --> 03:36.715
Please, I...
I'm a "doctor,"
not a "mister."

03:36.717 --> 03:39.885
Doctor. Of course.

03:39.887 --> 03:44.389
Well, it is an important day
for both you and for us.

03:44.391 --> 03:46.658
We want to make your settling in
to Cliffside Manor

03:46.660 --> 03:48.327
as comfortable as possible.

03:48.329 --> 03:49.895
Well, I think of it more

03:49.897 --> 03:53.498
as an unfortunate day
than an important one.

03:53.500 --> 03:56.301
What kind of a doctor
were you?

03:56.303 --> 03:59.972
I specialized in cardiac
and GI disease,

03:59.974 --> 04:03.008
and before that
I was an internist.

04:03.010 --> 04:06.311
Internal medicine has changed
over the years.

04:06.313 --> 04:07.746
Tell me about it.

04:11.451 --> 04:15.887
Do you have any questions,
Mrs. Mandelbaum?

04:15.889 --> 04:19.690
Uh, no blanks
or statements.

04:24.030 --> 04:26.865
So, all of your clothes
are labeled?

04:26.867 --> 04:29.635
Yes, our names
are on everything.

04:29.637 --> 04:34.039
Good. Uh, let's start
with valuables.

04:34.041 --> 04:37.909
Uh, uh, we both
have gold rings.

04:37.911 --> 04:39.878
Do you ever
take those off?

04:39.880 --> 04:41.880
-No.
-Good.

04:41.882 --> 04:44.316
Um, anything else?

04:44.318 --> 04:46.885
Yes, my wife
has a fur coat.

04:46.887 --> 04:48.887
That's not allowed,
Mr. Mandelbaum.

04:48.889 --> 04:51.590
It's Dr. Mandelbaum.
I'm not a "mister,"

04:51.592 --> 04:54.493
and I could not bring her
without the fur coat.

04:54.495 --> 04:57.763
-It makes her happy.
-I understand, Mr. Mandelbaum--

04:57.765 --> 04:59.498
Dr. Mandelbaum--

04:59.500 --> 05:02.301
but we can't be responsible
for a fur coat.

05:02.303 --> 05:04.536
I don't care, okay?

05:04.538 --> 05:06.071
Okay, I'll make a note.

05:28.728 --> 05:30.395
Abe?

05:33.499 --> 05:35.801
-Abe? Abe?
-Oh, God.

05:35.803 --> 05:38.337
-Oh, God.
-Abe, where am I?

05:38.339 --> 05:41.840
Molly! Molly,
everything's okay.
Everything's fine.

05:41.842 --> 05:44.643
This is our new home.

05:44.645 --> 05:47.913
All is well.
I love you.

05:47.915 --> 05:51.016
I love you very much.

06:04.831 --> 06:06.798
It's all right.

06:20.813 --> 06:22.914
Here, Molly.
That's good.

06:22.916 --> 06:25.684
This is a good chair.
Here.

06:29.122 --> 06:31.456
-Hi.
-Phil Nicoletti.

06:31.458 --> 06:33.525
Dr. Abe Mandelbaum.

06:33.527 --> 06:36.395
-This is my wife, Molly.
-Hello, Molly. How are you?

06:40.600 --> 06:44.536
So, what brings you here
to this home, Phil?

06:44.538 --> 06:46.938
You got a half hour?

06:46.940 --> 06:50.075
Cataracts, diabetes,
sleep apnea,

06:50.077 --> 06:53.678
stenosis of the back,
four slipped discs, cancer.

06:53.680 --> 06:55.947
Well, I'm sorry to hear that.

06:55.949 --> 06:57.916
What am I going to say?

06:57.918 --> 06:59.951
I'm passing through?
I'm on vacation?

06:59.953 --> 07:02.421
-Well, you're looking good.
-Abe,

07:02.423 --> 07:05.791
there are three ages
in life, I think:
You're young,

07:05.793 --> 07:08.727
you're middle aged,
and "you're looking good."

07:08.729 --> 07:12.664
How about you, Abe?
What brings you here?

07:12.666 --> 07:14.132
My wife.

07:16.102 --> 07:18.603
She's...

07:18.605 --> 07:20.505
I couldn't keep her home
anymore.

07:20.507 --> 07:23.141
-And you?
-Oh, I'm okay.

07:23.143 --> 07:25.744
I've had... I had,
um, you know,

07:25.746 --> 07:28.680
heart trouble a little bit
and a minor stroke.

07:28.682 --> 07:30.549
I'm okay.

07:31.584 --> 07:32.918
Can I help you?

07:32.920 --> 07:34.719
What's happening here?

07:34.721 --> 07:36.888
I think she's dying.
Somebody come over here!

07:36.890 --> 07:38.523
I think she's dying.

07:38.525 --> 07:40.625
Damn it!
Come over here!

07:44.797 --> 07:48.200
- Oh, my God.
- Take care of the doctor.

07:48.202 --> 07:50.001
Jesus Christ.

07:53.573 --> 07:55.207
Abe, honey.

07:55.209 --> 07:57.509
Abe.

07:59.045 --> 08:00.912
- Abe!
- Baby.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.848
Come on.

08:02.850 --> 08:06.551
Oh! Oh, there you are.

08:06.553 --> 08:08.687
Molly...

08:08.689 --> 08:10.622
Oh, I was scared.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.893
-What happened?
-It's okay.

08:14.895 --> 08:17.696
Debbie, you think maybe
you can get him some water?

08:17.698 --> 08:19.064
Okay.

08:22.034 --> 08:23.702
-Abe...
-Yeah?

08:23.704 --> 08:27.105
That woman died.
They took her away.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.708
-Abe, what happened to you?
-I guess I passed out.

08:29.710 --> 08:31.776
I...

08:31.778 --> 08:33.778
I hate it when people die.

08:33.780 --> 08:35.746
Vacant look in their eye--

08:35.749 --> 08:38.283
I mean, you just never
get used to it.

08:38.284 --> 08:40.018
I saw it once.

08:41.953 --> 08:44.890
I never want to
see it again.

08:54.100 --> 08:57.135
-Who are you?
-Oh, I'm Angela.

08:57.137 --> 08:58.970
Curly Bryant.
I'm 84.

08:58.972 --> 09:01.873
I've been here two years.
I like it.

09:01.875 --> 09:04.976
-Who you got here, Curly?
-I don't know.

09:04.978 --> 09:07.679
-You're his granddaughter?
-Oh, uh, no.

09:07.681 --> 09:09.147
I'm a new nurse here.

09:09.149 --> 09:11.583
I was a boxer
at the Elliot Street Gym.

09:11.585 --> 09:13.151
Golden Gloves champion.

09:13.153 --> 09:15.287
-Oh, wow.
-He was a janitor.

09:15.289 --> 09:17.856
Got hit in the head
too many times.

09:17.858 --> 09:21.126
I'm Jennilee Dublan.
Curly's my boyfriend.

09:21.128 --> 09:24.329
Can't be too picky.
There aren't many
eligible men here.

09:44.083 --> 09:45.917
Mr. Grollman?

09:45.919 --> 09:49.154
Hello, Doctor.

09:49.156 --> 09:51.289
What was it
you wanted to discuss?

09:51.291 --> 09:54.659
Well, uh, my wife, Molly,
has a fur coat,

09:54.661 --> 09:57.796
and I'd like you to see
to it that your staff

09:57.798 --> 10:00.599
realizes that she has
the right to keep it.

10:00.601 --> 10:03.735
You need to sign
a waiver.

10:03.737 --> 10:07.005
We're not liable
for the coat.

10:23.389 --> 10:25.323
Any other questions?

10:25.325 --> 10:29.094
What prompted you to want to be
director of this place?

10:29.096 --> 10:33.698
I... hate old people.

10:33.700 --> 10:37.102
I've lost some hearing.
I think...

10:37.104 --> 10:39.738
you either said,
"I hate old people"

10:39.740 --> 10:42.007
or "I ate old people,"

10:42.009 --> 10:44.009
but either way,
it doesn't make a lot of sense.

10:44.011 --> 10:48.680
I said,
"I hate old people."

10:51.350 --> 10:53.385
Well...

10:53.387 --> 10:55.387
Is this some kind of a joke?

10:55.389 --> 10:57.956
Why would
I tell you a joke?

10:57.958 --> 11:01.826
Look what happened to you
the other day at lunch.

11:01.828 --> 11:07.165
Your wife has permission
to keep her coat.

11:07.167 --> 11:09.868
Uh, thank you.

11:37.697 --> 11:38.997
Where did
you work before?

11:38.999 --> 11:41.366
Um, at
a children's hospital.

11:41.368 --> 11:44.302
Folks here on the fourth floor
might as well <i>be</i> babies.

11:44.304 --> 11:47.872
Feed 'em, clean 'em, put 'em
in wheelchairs in the hall,

11:47.874 --> 11:50.408
then back in bed
and lift up the side rails.

11:50.410 --> 11:52.877
How long have
you worked here?

11:52.879 --> 11:55.413
Four years, but I only work
on the fourth floor

11:55.415 --> 11:57.282
a few months of the year.

11:57.284 --> 11:59.784
And how big is the floor?
How many men?

11:59.786 --> 12:02.921
Twenty-four people,
six men.

12:04.824 --> 12:06.791
Time to clean Billy.

12:06.793 --> 12:09.928
Want to try
or watch me first?

12:09.930 --> 12:11.463
Um, I'll watch.

12:11.465 --> 12:14.165
One thing
you got to know is,

12:14.167 --> 12:17.235
you're going to want to
breathe through your mouth.

12:17.237 --> 12:20.739
Billy! You may feel
some pressure, okay?

12:20.741 --> 12:22.373
All right.

12:22.375 --> 12:25.810
There we go.

12:25.812 --> 12:30.315
♪ Now, if you get there
before I do ♪

12:30.317 --> 12:34.018
♪ Coming for
to carry me home ♪

12:34.020 --> 12:36.187
♪ Tell all my friends

12:36.189 --> 12:38.423
♪ That I'll be coming too

12:38.425 --> 12:41.893
♪ Coming for to carry me home

12:41.895 --> 12:46.231
♪ Swing low, sweet chariot

12:46.233 --> 12:48.533
♪ Coming for to carry me home

12:48.535 --> 12:51.302
These two old guys
are in a restaurant,
and they're reading about

12:51.304 --> 12:55.306
how the college kids run naked
through the classrooms.

12:55.308 --> 12:58.209
And one guy says to the other,
he says, "That's a good idea.

12:58.211 --> 13:00.345
We got nothing else to do.
Let's do it."

13:00.347 --> 13:03.381
So they go balls-ass naked,
running through the rest home.

13:03.383 --> 13:05.817
They pass two old women,

13:05.819 --> 13:08.520
and one of them says,
"Did you see what just passed?"

13:08.522 --> 13:11.422
And the other says,
"Yes, and did you see
what they were wearing?"

13:11.424 --> 13:14.425
She said, "Yes,
and it needed ironing."

13:16.996 --> 13:19.297
Aw, come on,
it's a great joke.

13:19.299 --> 13:21.366
It's a joke.
I'm not sure it's great.

13:21.368 --> 13:23.468
Are you suggesting
that you and I

13:23.470 --> 13:25.537
run through
this place naked?

13:25.539 --> 13:28.039
It would take us too long
to get our clothes off.

13:28.041 --> 13:29.974
They would probably
tie us to our beds.

13:29.976 --> 13:32.010
Yeah.

13:32.012 --> 13:34.345
Oh.

13:34.347 --> 13:37.382
I-- I remember a joke,
a dirty joke.

13:37.384 --> 13:38.850
-You?
-Yeah.

13:38.852 --> 13:40.151
-A dirty joke?
-Yeah.

13:40.153 --> 13:42.887
Shame all over you.
Go for it.

13:42.889 --> 13:45.990
Okay. This guy...

13:45.992 --> 13:48.827
is an old guy, and there's
a knock on his door,

13:48.829 --> 13:51.095
and he opens the door,
and there's a woman there

13:51.097 --> 13:55.400
wearing a short mini skirt
and a low blouse,

13:55.402 --> 13:59.337
and she's got piles
of makeup on,
and she says,

13:59.339 --> 14:02.106
"I'm here to give
you a present."

14:02.108 --> 14:05.009
And he says,
"What's the present?"

14:05.011 --> 14:08.880
And she says,
"Super sex."

14:08.882 --> 14:11.316
And he says, "Super sex?"
And she--

14:11.318 --> 14:13.418
Doc! Doc! Quick!

14:15.555 --> 14:20.225
No! Oh, look at the mess
you've made here!

14:20.227 --> 14:22.594
Oh, God.

14:22.596 --> 14:24.229
I think we're going
to have to sedate her.

14:24.231 --> 14:26.197
No! No meds!

14:26.199 --> 14:28.633
-Get away from me!
-I know what she needs!

14:28.635 --> 14:31.302
Molly! Molly!

14:33.139 --> 14:35.540
Oh!

14:36.609 --> 14:38.943
Let's put your coat on.

14:40.379 --> 14:41.946
Oh!

14:47.419 --> 14:48.920
Oh!

14:49.989 --> 14:51.623
She's okay.

15:22.154 --> 15:24.222
- Hello.
- Hi.

15:24.224 --> 15:27.058
You're not supposed
to be smoking here.

15:27.060 --> 15:30.261
Yeah, I'm not sure
if I really care.

15:30.263 --> 15:32.030
What's the matter?

15:32.032 --> 15:33.431
Nothing.

15:33.433 --> 15:35.667
Well,
something's the matter.

15:35.669 --> 15:39.237
I mean, you're pacing,
you're smoking, you're...

15:39.239 --> 15:43.708
I mean,
something must be wrong.

15:43.710 --> 15:46.511
I'm all right.

15:47.613 --> 15:50.448
I'm Abe Mandelbaum.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.183
I'm Angela.

15:52.185 --> 15:53.618
Donadio, my last name.

15:53.620 --> 15:55.954
It's a pleasure
meeting you.

16:11.337 --> 16:13.204
Abe...

16:14.606 --> 16:16.507
come over here.

16:20.346 --> 16:24.115
-What?
-Abe, I wanna clink on you.

16:24.117 --> 16:26.117
No, wait, wait, wait.

16:30.589 --> 16:32.623
Let me just
put my arms around you.

16:32.625 --> 16:34.325
It's late, it's late,
it's late.

16:34.327 --> 16:36.194
It's time to sleep,
my darling.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.563
Oh.
Oh, come on, Abe.

16:38.565 --> 16:42.100
No. No, I...

16:42.102 --> 16:44.002
It's time to sleep.

16:46.038 --> 16:49.040
I can't do it anymore.
You know that.

16:49.042 --> 16:51.776
-It doesn't work.
-Try, Abe.

16:51.778 --> 16:54.379
Try for me, huh?

16:54.381 --> 16:57.115
Okay, I...

16:57.117 --> 17:00.418
I'll help you, Molly.

17:16.602 --> 17:19.369
Oh, my darling.

17:42.428 --> 17:44.562
I love you, Abe.

17:49.601 --> 17:51.402
I love you.

17:53.505 --> 17:55.339
Oh.

17:55.341 --> 17:57.475
Oh, Abe, don't cry.

17:57.477 --> 17:59.343
Don't cry.

17:59.345 --> 18:01.479
No.

18:01.481 --> 18:04.148
It's all right,
my darling.

18:04.150 --> 18:05.583
I love you.

18:33.245 --> 18:35.746
So, have a family?

18:35.748 --> 18:39.117
No. Uh, I was never married,
so I got no kids.

18:39.119 --> 18:42.487
Nobody to come and see me.
There's a lot of people
in here like that.

18:42.489 --> 18:44.555
The things that gave me
pleasure in my life

18:44.557 --> 18:47.158
were baseball, poker,
and fucking.

18:47.160 --> 18:49.627
But not in that order.

18:49.629 --> 18:52.330
Why don't you finish telling me
that joke you were telling me?
Sounds interesting.

18:52.332 --> 18:55.133
-What?
-The one where the beautiful
woman knocks on the door

18:55.135 --> 18:57.602
and says, "I have
a birthday present for you."

18:57.604 --> 18:59.537
Yeah. Okay.

18:59.539 --> 19:02.473
Uh, she says, "I've got
a present for you,"

19:02.475 --> 19:04.742
and he says,
"What's the present?"

19:04.744 --> 19:08.312
And she says, "Super sex,"
and she pinches his cheek.

19:08.314 --> 19:11.282
and he says,
"Super sex?"

19:11.284 --> 19:13.918
And he thinks for a minute,
and then he says,

19:13.920 --> 19:16.254
"I'll take the soup."

19:18.924 --> 19:22.460
That's so funny, it hurts.
I wish it didn't apply to me.

19:22.462 --> 19:24.662
Yeah.

19:24.664 --> 19:28.299
It's been five years
since I've had an erection.

19:28.301 --> 19:31.903
It all began
when Molly became sick.

19:31.905 --> 19:34.438
Ah, you know,

19:34.440 --> 19:37.341
she may be losing her mind,
but not her desire.

19:37.343 --> 19:39.410
I'm the one who's failing.

19:39.412 --> 19:42.380
So you can't get it up anymore.
That's been my problem
for years.

19:42.382 --> 19:45.216
Oh, yeah, I loved sex.

19:45.218 --> 19:47.285
Nothing I like better
than a good fuck.

19:49.488 --> 19:51.923
My record making a woman come
is nine times.

19:53.425 --> 19:55.359
Nine times.

19:55.361 --> 19:58.229
How many women
have you slept with?

19:58.231 --> 19:59.497
A few hundred.

19:59.499 --> 20:01.199
-No!
-Yeah.

20:01.201 --> 20:02.800
You want names?

20:02.802 --> 20:05.503
Don't tell me that you can
remember all their names.

20:05.505 --> 20:07.538
-Every name.
-What?

20:07.540 --> 20:09.607
I had a system.

20:09.609 --> 20:11.342
Every time I'd screw a woman,

20:11.344 --> 20:13.511
I'd put her name on the list,

20:13.513 --> 20:16.314
and then I would recite
the list to myself

20:16.316 --> 20:19.250
two or three times a week
before going to sleep.

20:19.252 --> 20:21.285
It was like counting sheep.

20:21.287 --> 20:23.421
My God.

20:23.423 --> 20:25.456
The last one
was named Gloria.

20:25.458 --> 20:27.858
She was a beautiful woman.

20:29.261 --> 20:31.729
And I knew I was in trouble,
because...

20:31.731 --> 20:34.966
I only got hard once, right,

20:34.968 --> 20:37.735
and then I couldn't
get hard again.

20:37.737 --> 20:40.471
And, uh, she was
a sweet soul.

20:40.473 --> 20:42.907
She was trying to help me.
She used a feather.

20:42.909 --> 20:45.509
She put syrup on my dick
and licked it off.

20:45.511 --> 20:47.545
Am I being
too graphic for you?

20:47.547 --> 20:50.348
-No, no, no.
-Yeah?

20:50.350 --> 20:52.416
And then, uh,

20:52.418 --> 20:54.719
nothing worked,
nothing could happen,

20:54.721 --> 20:56.520
and I was so embarrassed,
I just...

20:56.522 --> 20:58.456
-You know what I did?
-What?

20:58.458 --> 21:00.558
I put my head in her lap...

21:03.662 --> 21:05.630
and I cried like a baby.

21:10.435 --> 21:14.405
Hey, nothing wrong
with crying, Phil.

21:16.775 --> 21:18.776
You know, Abe,

21:18.778 --> 21:22.513
if I had had a gun that day,
I would have shot myself.

21:22.515 --> 21:24.682
It was so much
a part of me.

21:24.684 --> 21:28.552
I went to the doctor, and they
discovered the diabetes.

21:28.554 --> 21:30.788
I tried those pills
they have these days,

21:30.790 --> 21:32.790
but they didn't do shit.

21:32.792 --> 21:36.494
And there I was,
a 54-year-old Italian man...

21:38.597 --> 21:42.433
with sweet blood
and a soft dick.

21:45.804 --> 21:51.409
♪ Row, row, row your boat
gently down the stream ♪

21:51.411 --> 21:53.944
♪ Merrily, merrily,
merrily merrily ♪

21:53.946 --> 21:56.781
♪ Life is but a dream

21:56.783 --> 21:59.650
♪ Row, row, row your boat

21:59.652 --> 22:02.320

22:02.322 --> 22:04.989
♪ Merrily, merrily,
merrily merrily ♪

22:04.991 --> 22:07.458
♪ Life is but a dream

22:10.529 --> 22:11.962
Hey, there.

22:11.964 --> 22:14.031
I haven't seen you
around lately.

22:14.033 --> 22:16.067
It's good to see you
without a cigarette.

22:16.069 --> 22:17.702
Oh.

22:17.704 --> 22:20.671
Yeah, well, smoking is
the least of my problems.

22:20.673 --> 22:22.673
What kind of problems?

22:24.743 --> 22:27.111
Okay.

22:27.113 --> 22:28.846
I'm adopted.

22:30.749 --> 22:34.685
My adoptive father died
when I was in high school,

22:34.687 --> 22:37.388
and six months ago,

22:37.390 --> 22:39.824
my adoptive mother
passed away.

22:39.826 --> 22:42.893
And... since then,

22:42.895 --> 22:45.996
I've just felt like
an orphan all over again,

22:45.998 --> 22:47.998
and I started having
these nightmares.

22:48.000 --> 22:49.867
What kind of nightmare?

22:49.869 --> 22:52.970
That I'm trapped
in this giant house,

22:52.972 --> 22:55.673
and I can't get out.

22:55.675 --> 22:59.477
I just keep going
from one room to another.

23:01.413 --> 23:03.614
I'm 35. You know,
I'm not married.

23:03.616 --> 23:06.884
I'm an only child.

23:06.886 --> 23:10.721
I can't stay trapped
inside this house forever.

23:16.528 --> 23:19.563
Yeah, what kind
of cancer was it?

23:19.565 --> 23:21.999
Colon.
I took a crap one day.

23:22.001 --> 23:25.102
There was blood, and right away
they were cutting me up.

23:25.104 --> 23:27.104
-But it never metastasized.
-No.

23:27.106 --> 23:29.640
According to them,
the results are negative,

23:29.642 --> 23:32.042
but I developed cataracts
and now I don't see very well.

23:32.044 --> 23:34.979
-Oh. Mind if I take a look?
-No, not at all.

23:36.581 --> 23:39.150
Oh, yeah.
I can see your cataracts.

23:40.919 --> 23:43.654
-Yeah.
-Anything else?

23:43.656 --> 23:46.190
-Uh, no, no.
-Oh.

23:48.794 --> 23:51.529
I'm glad you're here.

23:52.798 --> 23:54.832
Hello, Sadie.

23:54.834 --> 23:58.502
- Want to get together?
We can get busy later.
- Stop it.

23:58.504 --> 24:01.005
-She doesn't even know what
the fuck I'm talking about.
-Stop it. Stop it.

24:03.476 --> 24:06.977
Hi, Sister Elizabeth?
I really need your help.

24:06.979 --> 24:09.880
I told you the last time
you were here, Angela.

24:09.882 --> 24:13.150
I checked on
the adoption records,
but I couldn't find anything.

24:13.152 --> 24:16.587
Yeah, something happened
since the last time we spoke.

24:19.658 --> 24:20.991
I received a note.

24:29.968 --> 24:31.936
Do you know who sent this?

24:31.938 --> 24:33.771
I have no idea.

24:35.974 --> 24:38.175
Well, what are
you going to do?

24:38.177 --> 24:40.878
Well I went to visit
Cliffside Manor,

24:40.880 --> 24:44.148
and then...
I took a job there.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.183
Do you think
that's crazy?

24:46.185 --> 24:49.086
It's not crazy
if you really want to find him.

24:49.088 --> 24:51.155
Who am I, Sister?

24:52.791 --> 24:56.660
I... I'm afraid
I'm just a mistake.

24:56.662 --> 24:58.062
Come sit.

25:03.068 --> 25:06.003
You are who you are,

25:06.005 --> 25:09.006
no matter how
you were conceived.

25:09.008 --> 25:11.208
You are many things,
Angela,

25:11.210 --> 25:14.111
but you are not a mistake.

25:14.113 --> 25:16.814
I'm just worried
that this is a bad idea.

25:16.816 --> 25:20.584
I know you don't think I should
be looking for my birth parents,

25:20.586 --> 25:25.155
but I... I feel like
I have no choice.

25:25.157 --> 25:27.558
How am I supposed to know
who I am

25:27.560 --> 25:30.961
if I don't know
where I came from?

25:30.963 --> 25:34.231
Follow your heart, Angela.

25:39.804 --> 25:42.273
I can't stop thinking
about that note, you know?

25:42.275 --> 25:44.775
I mean, who wrote it?

25:44.777 --> 25:46.911
Was it my mother?
And...

25:46.913 --> 25:51.015
I just keep looking at
all of these men's faces

25:51.017 --> 25:55.619
and wondering if one
of them is my father.

26:03.328 --> 26:06.196
I don't know
how else to ask you,

26:06.198 --> 26:09.867
but, um,
did you ever...

26:09.869 --> 26:13.037
Angela, I think
I've told you before.

26:13.039 --> 26:15.573
Molly and I
could not have children.

26:15.575 --> 26:18.709
We tried. And tried.

27:08.860 --> 27:11.629
Now, that is
a nice picture.

27:11.631 --> 27:13.764
You've got to be kidding.

27:13.766 --> 27:15.232
Well, here.

27:18.036 --> 27:20.404
Try again.

27:34.085 --> 27:36.153
How's everyone doing here?

27:52.037 --> 27:54.905
How's the drawing going?

27:54.907 --> 27:59.710
-Oh, I'm-I'm Abe Mandelbaum.
-I'm Sheryl.

27:59.712 --> 28:02.112
-Hello, Sheryl.
-Hello, Abe.

28:04.849 --> 28:07.951
Maybe you want
to draw something.

28:07.953 --> 28:09.386
Why not?

28:28.206 --> 28:29.707
What?

28:30.709 --> 28:32.142
What do you think?

28:32.144 --> 28:35.145
Why are you
drawing this?

28:35.147 --> 28:37.281
Well, I like drawing houses.

28:37.283 --> 28:38.949
Are you making fun
of me?

28:38.951 --> 28:40.751
No.

28:40.753 --> 28:43.053
Look, young lady,
I happen to be a doctor,

28:43.055 --> 28:46.857
and I happen to know that
my drawing is infantile.

28:46.859 --> 28:50.094
And I thought you were here to
help people and not mock them.

28:50.096 --> 28:53.130
I didn't mean to mock you.
I didn't mean to hurt you.

28:55.400 --> 28:57.067
Well, okay, then.

28:57.069 --> 29:00.170
Let's forget about
the pictures.

29:00.172 --> 29:03.207
Who-- Who are you?

29:03.209 --> 29:05.375
I'm a volunteer.

29:05.377 --> 29:07.377
I like being with old folks.

29:07.379 --> 29:10.481
-Eh, it's no fun being old.
-I know. I hate it too.

29:10.483 --> 29:13.517
Yeah, but you're...
you're not old.

29:13.519 --> 29:16.520
-I'm 54.
-I'm 83.

29:20.759 --> 29:24.094
My face is...

29:24.096 --> 29:26.764
getting awful,

29:26.766 --> 29:29.399
but none of the plastic surgeons
will operate.

29:29.401 --> 29:31.401
What's to operate on?

29:31.403 --> 29:34.371
Well, the pits on my face.
They're very painful.

29:34.373 --> 29:36.907
You don't have pits
on your face.

29:36.909 --> 29:38.475
I do.

29:38.477 --> 29:41.979
It's just, you can't see them,
but I can feel them.

29:45.150 --> 29:47.050
Oh.

29:48.853 --> 29:50.454
I used to be a singer,

29:50.456 --> 29:53.924
but my voice
isn't good anymore.

29:53.926 --> 29:55.359
Are you married?

29:55.361 --> 29:57.294
Divorced.

29:57.296 --> 29:59.429
Children?

29:59.431 --> 30:01.198
Yeah, I have one,

30:01.200 --> 30:03.333
but I don't see him much.

30:05.436 --> 30:08.338
Are you married?

30:08.340 --> 30:11.208
You know, I'm curious
about that.

30:11.210 --> 30:13.844
-What's in there?
-Photographs.

30:13.846 --> 30:15.879
Oh.

30:15.881 --> 30:17.314
When I was 16,

30:17.316 --> 30:20.551
I went to Florida
to visit my uncle,

30:20.553 --> 30:24.054
and one day a man with
a big camera around his neck

30:24.056 --> 30:27.257
asked if he could
take my picture.

30:27.259 --> 30:29.927
He said
I was so beautiful that

30:29.929 --> 30:32.596
he could take pictures
of me forever.

30:32.598 --> 30:34.231
-Wow.
-Hmm.

30:34.233 --> 30:37.234
And then he took me
to California to make me a star.

30:39.304 --> 30:41.405
I took modeling
and singing lessons,

30:41.407 --> 30:44.274
but nothing ever came of it.

30:44.276 --> 30:46.610
You know.

30:46.612 --> 30:49.246
And now...

30:49.248 --> 30:51.381
my face is changing.

30:54.285 --> 30:56.086
I look so old.

30:56.088 --> 30:57.588
No, you don't.

30:57.590 --> 31:01.925
You don't look old.
You look beautiful.

31:01.927 --> 31:04.027
You want to see
my photographs?

31:04.029 --> 31:06.463
-Yes, I'd love to.
-Okay.

31:16.574 --> 31:19.176
Wow.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.913
-Long time ago.
-Mm-hmm.

31:25.184 --> 31:27.951
Wow.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.654
These are beautiful.

31:30.656 --> 31:32.656
But I'll tell you
something--

31:36.594 --> 31:41.031
You are still beautiful.

31:41.033 --> 31:43.367
-Really?
-Really.

31:45.370 --> 31:46.937
I like you.

31:48.673 --> 31:50.307
I like you.

31:50.309 --> 31:53.043
I like being with you.

32:00.251 --> 32:01.652
What's the matter?

32:03.354 --> 32:05.455
What is it?

32:05.457 --> 32:08.025
Uh, nothing.
I'm fine.

32:09.627 --> 32:11.695
I have to go now, Abe.

32:11.697 --> 32:13.530
Let's talk
again soon, okay?

32:13.532 --> 32:15.933
Yeah, I'd love to.

32:20.972 --> 32:23.440
Oh, my God.

32:28.479 --> 32:32.082
Molly? You won't believe
what happened to me.

32:32.084 --> 32:35.218
I have a surprise
for you.

33:52.764 --> 33:54.765
Oh, God!

34:22.793 --> 34:25.295
Oh, God.

34:31.168 --> 34:33.637
Oh, Phil!

34:33.639 --> 34:36.239
You're not going to believe
what happened to me.

34:36.241 --> 34:37.706
You got laid.

34:37.708 --> 34:39.708
I'm sorry.
I got a one-track mind.

34:39.710 --> 34:42.079
Well you're
in the right ball park.

34:42.081 --> 34:44.848
-What ball park?
-Well, I mean, women.
Getting laid.

34:44.850 --> 34:47.818
-You got laid?
-No.

34:47.820 --> 34:49.719
-You almost got laid?
-No.

34:49.721 --> 34:51.621
-You were with a woman?
-Yes.

34:51.623 --> 34:53.556
Well, what good is it?
You can't do anything.

34:53.559 --> 34:56.159
-But I did.
-You did what?

34:56.161 --> 34:57.828
I got hard.

34:57.830 --> 34:59.729
You got hard?

34:59.731 --> 35:01.698
-Yeah.
-So did you stick it in her?

35:01.700 --> 35:04.668
The whole point to have it
is to stick it in her, Doctor.

35:04.670 --> 35:07.104
-That's what it's for.
-But I didn't have the chance.

35:07.106 --> 35:08.572
So what did you do?
Play with yourself?

35:08.574 --> 35:11.741
-Yes, on my bed.
-Oh, Jesus fucking Christ.

35:11.743 --> 35:14.878
Hey, hey, hey.
Don't take this away from me.
It's all I've got.

35:14.880 --> 35:17.681
Look, if you get a hard-on,
you're supposed to stick it
in a woman.

35:17.683 --> 35:19.749
-That's what a hard-on is for.
-I just think you're jealous.

35:19.751 --> 35:21.451
Jealous?
You know, go fuck yourself.

35:21.453 --> 35:23.220
-Fuck you! Hey!
-No, fuck you!

35:23.222 --> 35:25.122
You're just
an old man who wants
to be called "Doctor."

35:25.124 --> 35:26.823
I'm old, yes,
but I am a doctor

35:26.825 --> 35:29.693
and I know you're
going to be dead soon, you...

35:32.763 --> 35:34.397
Oh, Jesus.

35:39.303 --> 35:40.837
What do you mean?

35:43.774 --> 35:45.809
I'm sorry.

35:48.347 --> 35:51.248
I saw it in your eyes.
They're jaundiced.

35:51.250 --> 35:54.918
That means your cancer
has moved to your liver.

35:56.721 --> 35:58.588
I'm so sorry.

36:03.227 --> 36:07.597
Just... don't make fun of me.

36:07.599 --> 36:10.267
Don't make fun of me.
Goddamn it!

36:49.273 --> 36:50.607
Gotcha.

36:52.677 --> 36:55.512
I'm going to report you
to the administration.

36:55.514 --> 36:58.982
The administration
takes due note.

36:58.984 --> 37:01.318
What are you drinking?

37:01.320 --> 37:04.321
-You really wanna know?
-I do.

37:04.323 --> 37:07.657
Deal the cards,
and I'll tell you.

37:07.659 --> 37:11.995
So, there's a doctor
in Switzerland,

37:11.997 --> 37:16.866
injects cells from fetal lambs
to stop aging.

37:16.868 --> 37:19.369
He's treated
famous people--

37:19.371 --> 37:21.671
Winston Churchill,
Charlie Chaplin.

37:21.673 --> 37:24.441
News flash.
They're both dead.

37:24.443 --> 37:28.511
But they lived
to a ripe, old age.

37:28.513 --> 37:30.580
Is that that fetal shit
you're drinking?

37:32.650 --> 37:35.485
Mmm. No.

37:35.487 --> 37:37.687
Similar idea, though.

37:47.565 --> 37:49.266
Human cancer cells.

37:49.268 --> 37:51.301
I am so the fuck
out of here.

37:52.670 --> 37:54.704
Cancer cells live forever,

37:54.706 --> 37:56.906
and by integrating them
with normal cells,

37:56.908 --> 37:59.309
they can halt
the aging process.

37:59.311 --> 38:01.778
You know that you're going
to get cancer, right?

38:01.780 --> 38:03.647
No, they can't cause cancer.

38:03.649 --> 38:06.349
They're in an incomplete form.

38:06.351 --> 38:08.818
I've been taking them
for six months.

38:08.820 --> 38:10.754
Never felt better.

38:12.056 --> 38:14.424
Well, that is interesting.

38:18.296 --> 38:21.298
-Abe Mandelbaum--
you know, the doctor.
-Yeah.

38:21.300 --> 38:23.933
He looked at me

38:23.935 --> 38:26.703
and told me that
my cancer had spread.

38:28.739 --> 38:32.375
So, let me ask you...

38:34.578 --> 38:37.013
what if I took
some of that stuff?

38:37.015 --> 38:40.383
It could serve
a dual purpose for you.

38:40.385 --> 38:43.653
It could stop the aging process,
but second,

38:43.655 --> 38:45.922
it can act as a vaccine,

38:45.924 --> 38:48.591
help your body kill
its own cancer cells.

38:48.593 --> 38:51.561
So you're telling me that you
have a treatment for old age

38:51.563 --> 38:54.097
that cures cancer
on the side?

38:54.099 --> 38:55.899
Crazier things
have happened.

39:00.971 --> 39:02.772
Well, I'm a gambling man.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.976
Pfft!
Set me up.

39:06.978 --> 39:09.112
Movement...

39:09.114 --> 39:12.382
is what creates life.

39:12.384 --> 39:13.516
Ready?

39:13.518 --> 39:17.053
Ten, nine,

39:17.055 --> 39:18.888
eight...

39:18.890 --> 39:21.991
Clap. Seven, six,

39:21.993 --> 39:25.662
five, four,

39:25.664 --> 39:29.032
three, two, and one.

39:29.034 --> 39:32.469
All right, everybody's
looking good. Very good.

39:32.471 --> 39:34.771
How does that feel?
Good?

39:43.514 --> 39:45.515
I'm sorry, Phil.

39:45.517 --> 39:47.484
Um, can I talk to you
for a minute?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.052
Of course.

39:49.054 --> 39:52.055
-Ladies, will you excuse me?
-I'm sorry, ladies.

39:56.026 --> 39:58.628
-Yeah?
-The reason I got a job here

39:58.630 --> 40:01.831
is because I got a note

40:01.833 --> 40:04.501
that my father
is at Cliffside.

40:04.503 --> 40:07.003
Uh, I'm adopted,

40:07.005 --> 40:09.739
and I'm searching
for my birth father.

40:11.776 --> 40:13.476
And I wanted to ask you--

40:13.478 --> 40:15.845
No.

40:15.847 --> 40:19.682
I was never married.
I never had any children.

40:19.684 --> 40:21.851
I mean, it's certainly
possible,

40:21.853 --> 40:24.487
but it's unlikely,
honey.

40:24.489 --> 40:26.189
I wish you were
my daughter.

40:26.191 --> 40:28.925
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

40:28.927 --> 40:31.027
And thanks for your time.

40:31.029 --> 40:34.497
Oh, anytime, every day.
Jeez.

40:46.844 --> 40:48.111
How are you doing, Phil?

40:49.613 --> 40:52.081
Hi, Abe.

40:52.083 --> 40:53.850
I guess I'm all right.

40:53.852 --> 40:55.952
Mind if I come in?

40:55.954 --> 40:57.787
No.

41:12.002 --> 41:15.071
I'm really sorry. I...

41:15.073 --> 41:18.808
I lost my temper,
and I should never have told you

41:18.810 --> 41:20.777
the way I did
that you had cancer.

41:20.779 --> 41:22.879
I'm sorry.

41:24.548 --> 41:25.815
I'm sorry too.

41:25.817 --> 41:27.517
I had no business
making fun of you.

41:27.519 --> 41:29.686
Hey, I deserved it.

41:29.688 --> 41:32.121
But I'm gonna
make up for it.

41:32.123 --> 41:34.691
-What are you gonna do?
-Something for both of us.

41:34.693 --> 41:37.560
-What?
-I'm gonna <i>shtup</i> Sheryl.

41:37.562 --> 41:40.263
I'm gonna actually
have sex with her.

41:40.265 --> 41:42.832
Who is Sheryl?

41:42.834 --> 41:46.569
Sheryl is the woman I met
in the activities room
that got me hard.

41:46.571 --> 41:48.271
-Oh, my God.
-Yeah!

41:48.273 --> 41:50.573
Dr. Mandelbaum!

41:50.575 --> 41:53.142
Man of science,
esteemed man of letters,

41:53.144 --> 41:54.911
is gonna fuck Sheryl!

41:54.913 --> 41:57.180
You're gonna get her alone?

41:57.182 --> 41:59.082
-Alone.
-And then you're gonna be
harder than you've ever been?

41:59.084 --> 42:02.151
-Harder than I've ever been!
-Aching, can't wait to get in?

42:02.153 --> 42:04.521
Aching and throbbing
and can't wait to get in!

42:04.523 --> 42:06.689
-Get on top of her.
-And I'll get on top of her!

42:06.691 --> 42:08.625
-You'll stick it in.
-And I'll stick it in!

42:08.627 --> 42:10.126
-She loves it!
-And she loves it!

42:10.128 --> 42:12.595
-And you do it--
-For both of us!

42:18.202 --> 42:20.537
Hi, Dr. Abe.

42:20.539 --> 42:22.605
Here I am.

42:22.607 --> 42:24.741
Are you happy to see me?

42:24.743 --> 42:26.743
You don't know how much.

42:28.646 --> 42:30.680
It was funny--

42:30.682 --> 42:33.583
I feel like
I'm 15 years old.

42:35.252 --> 42:37.687
That's jailbait for me.

42:47.632 --> 42:50.600
Abe, I can feel you.

42:50.602 --> 42:52.702
You're big.

42:52.704 --> 42:57.173
I haven't felt this good
in a long time.

43:01.078 --> 43:04.847
In fact, I'd love to do
something with it.

43:04.849 --> 43:06.749
Really?

43:06.751 --> 43:08.585
Really.

43:08.587 --> 43:09.953
With whom?

43:09.955 --> 43:12.121
With you.

43:12.123 --> 43:15.725
Come on.
In your condition?

43:15.727 --> 43:18.928
Yes, in my condit--
I'm feeling great.

43:18.930 --> 43:21.064
I'm feeling great.

43:21.066 --> 43:24.334
-You're not serious, are you?
-I'm very serious.

43:28.872 --> 43:30.873
Hi, Abe.
What's up?

43:30.875 --> 43:33.610
Well, Sheryl has agreed
to sleep with me.

43:33.612 --> 43:35.244
Really?

43:35.246 --> 43:37.614
-Yeah, but I'm...
-That's fantastic.

43:37.616 --> 43:40.650
Well, I'm having
second thoughts.

43:40.652 --> 43:43.786
Abe, come on. You promised.
This is for both of us.

43:43.788 --> 43:45.722
You gotta! Okay?

43:45.724 --> 43:49.325
I don't have a place to
do it in, so I'm gonna
call it off.

43:49.327 --> 43:51.894
Welcome to Phil's
palace of wonders.

43:55.867 --> 43:58.301
Here?

43:58.303 --> 44:00.303
-Okay.
-Okay.

44:00.305 --> 44:02.338
-I'll let you know when.
-Let me know.
I'll be out of here.

44:02.340 --> 44:04.040
<i>Coraggio.</i>

44:04.042 --> 44:05.675
-What?
-Courage.

44:05.677 --> 44:08.077
Oh, yeah. Okay.

44:09.747 --> 44:11.848
Go, Abe!

44:11.850 --> 44:14.083
Jeez, you are something.

44:18.188 --> 44:21.991
I arranged
a special room for us.

44:21.993 --> 44:25.028
It's called
the Phil Nicoletti Room.

44:25.030 --> 44:28.031
And we can even...
even watch television,

44:28.033 --> 44:29.999
if we want to,
from the bed.

44:31.835 --> 44:35.104
When was the last time
you had sex?

44:35.106 --> 44:38.307
-A long time ago.
-Mm.

44:40.044 --> 44:41.911
How about you?

44:41.913 --> 44:43.379
It was a year ago.

44:47.151 --> 44:49.152
Do you think
it's a little strange?

44:49.154 --> 44:53.089
I mean, you being here
with me now? I mean...

44:53.091 --> 44:56.793
No, I don't think
it's strange,

44:56.795 --> 44:59.195
'cause I like you, Abe.

44:59.197 --> 45:01.330
You're kind,

45:01.332 --> 45:04.467
and you understand me, and,

45:04.469 --> 45:07.837
I don't know,
I feel safe with you.

45:19.083 --> 45:21.951
-Here, you got that?
-I've got it.

45:21.953 --> 45:23.486
I'll take off...

45:42.372 --> 45:46.175
Ah, that feels good.

45:47.511 --> 45:50.313
Okay. Yeah.

45:54.785 --> 45:56.853
What?

45:56.855 --> 46:00.323
I can't come on top.
You go on top, okay?

46:03.160 --> 46:05.161
Oh.

46:05.163 --> 46:06.996
All right.

46:10.534 --> 46:12.902
- Hi.
- Hi.

46:18.809 --> 46:21.511
Faster, Abe.
It's got to be faster.

46:26.083 --> 46:28.351
No, harder.
Abe, Abe.

46:28.353 --> 46:32.054
Faster. Abe.

46:33.190 --> 46:35.324
Come on.
Come on.

46:40.531 --> 46:43.533
Come... Oh, come on.

46:43.535 --> 46:45.868
Abe?

46:45.870 --> 46:47.804
Abe?

46:47.806 --> 46:51.474
Seriously?

47:19.002 --> 47:21.971
Okay, we're going to have
a little "shake it up" time.

47:21.973 --> 47:23.973
Can anybody help me
pass these out?

47:23.975 --> 47:26.442
That would be good.

47:26.444 --> 47:28.477
We're going to do
a little rhythm section,

47:28.479 --> 47:31.047
and, uh, get some...

47:31.049 --> 47:33.015
I call these
the "hoochie coochies."

47:33.017 --> 47:34.517
- Hoochie coochies?
- Yeah, and you can...

47:34.519 --> 47:36.552
Oh, she's already
volunteering right there.

47:36.554 --> 47:39.088
Okay, good. There's
another one and another one.

47:39.090 --> 47:41.157
How was it?

47:41.159 --> 47:43.259
Oh, uh,

47:43.261 --> 47:45.595
it was wonderful.

47:47.598 --> 47:50.132
Absolutely wonderful.

47:50.134 --> 47:51.901
Really?

47:51.903 --> 47:54.036
Would I lie to you?

47:54.038 --> 47:56.939
Ha!
You are hot shit, Abe!

47:56.941 --> 47:58.941
Ah, I want to hear
all the details!

47:58.943 --> 48:02.044
How was her orgasm?

48:03.447 --> 48:05.548
-What do you mean?
-Her orgasm.

48:05.550 --> 48:07.383
You know, a woman has an orgasm.
How was it?

48:07.385 --> 48:09.252
Did she say anything
to you during it, like,

48:09.254 --> 48:10.953
"This is so great.
I love your dick,"
or whatever?

48:12.556 --> 48:14.223
I'm not sure.

48:14.225 --> 48:16.425
Well, I mean like,
"This is great.

48:16.427 --> 48:18.294
You're a great fuck."
Something? Nothing?

48:18.296 --> 48:20.596
I'm not sure.

48:20.598 --> 48:22.565
Okay. Let's establish
something here

48:22.567 --> 48:25.034
before I drop dead
this minute, okay?

48:25.036 --> 48:27.570
You were rock hard,
you were inside her.

48:27.572 --> 48:29.572
-Yeah.
-But that's all you remember?

48:29.574 --> 48:33.209
-Isn't that enough?
-Well...

48:33.211 --> 48:35.211
-Hey, Curly.
-I'm lost.

48:35.213 --> 48:36.913
Have you seen Jennilee?

48:36.915 --> 48:38.581
He's always lost.

48:38.583 --> 48:41.083
They shouldn't let him
walk around alone.

48:41.085 --> 48:42.585
There you are.

48:42.587 --> 48:45.154
Let's go to my room.

48:47.991 --> 48:51.260
What are they gonna do?
Get busy?

48:51.262 --> 48:53.462
Jesus Christ,
am I the only man in this joint

48:53.464 --> 48:55.431
that isn't getting laid?

48:57.634 --> 49:00.403
Yeah, if you could just
make sure she gets that.

49:00.405 --> 49:02.305
Yeah, I'll take it.

49:02.307 --> 49:04.473
Hello.
Can I help you?

49:04.475 --> 49:07.944
Yes, I'm here to see
my great uncle.

49:07.946 --> 49:10.713
-What's his name?
-Uh...

49:14.584 --> 49:18.287
Phil-- Phil Nicoletti,
room 104.

49:21.359 --> 49:24.093
Come in.

49:24.095 --> 49:26.295
Hello, Phil?

49:26.297 --> 49:29.465
Your uh, niece is here.

49:29.467 --> 49:31.467
Hi there.

49:31.469 --> 49:33.669
Come on in.
How's Mom?

49:36.173 --> 49:38.174
Come on in.

49:38.176 --> 49:39.508
-Hi.
-Hi.

49:39.510 --> 49:41.210
-How are you?
-Yeah, good.

49:41.212 --> 49:44.180
I'm just going to
put this here.

49:44.182 --> 49:47.116
Sure.

49:50.454 --> 49:51.988
Yeah.

49:53.390 --> 49:55.124
Uh, okay.

50:00.063 --> 50:02.264
Oh, God.
Okay, sorry.

50:02.266 --> 50:04.033
You don't seem
too comfortable.

50:04.035 --> 50:06.469
Sorry. I've just never been
in somewhere like this before.

50:06.471 --> 50:08.237
-Okay.
-Okay, sorry, my--

50:08.239 --> 50:09.705
The zipper too.
Oh, my God.

50:11.708 --> 50:14.744
It's just...

50:14.746 --> 50:18.381
Well, you know, um, uh...

50:18.383 --> 50:19.615
Oh, yeah, okay.

50:32.396 --> 50:34.263
Go a little faster.

50:53.517 --> 50:55.217
Okay, stop.

50:55.219 --> 50:57.620
Stop trying. Stop.

50:57.622 --> 51:00.322
-Sorry. I, uh...
-It's not your fault.

51:00.324 --> 51:02.458
Not your fault.

51:02.460 --> 51:04.527
Sit down.
Come on, sit down.

51:07.431 --> 51:09.665
I guess the goddamn
cancer cells didn't work.

51:09.667 --> 51:11.233
Not worth shit.

51:39.196 --> 51:41.263
Abe...

51:41.265 --> 51:43.099
Abe, my-my coat.

51:43.101 --> 51:44.733
Fix it.

51:50.774 --> 51:53.742
Oh, my coat!

51:53.744 --> 51:55.711
My coat!

51:59.182 --> 52:00.749
My coat...

52:08.425 --> 52:11.193
My coat!

52:11.195 --> 52:15.264
-I want my coat!
-Shh!

52:17.267 --> 52:19.835
No!

52:19.837 --> 52:21.403
It's mine...

52:25.475 --> 52:27.543
Much better. Good.

52:27.545 --> 52:30.779
Good girl.
You're okay.

52:30.781 --> 52:32.848
You're fine.

52:32.850 --> 52:34.550
You're fine.

52:50.267 --> 52:52.768
Hi, Abe.

52:52.770 --> 52:54.603
Hi.

52:57.207 --> 52:59.341
Hey, what's the matter?

53:01.478 --> 53:04.647
It's Molly. I...

53:04.649 --> 53:07.416
What happened to her?

53:07.418 --> 53:10.186
They stole her fur coat.

53:10.188 --> 53:12.588
She had a fur coat here?

53:12.590 --> 53:15.491
Yeah. I couldn't bring her
without it.

53:17.327 --> 53:20.663
They had to medicate her.
I...

53:50.260 --> 53:52.494
Do you want
to talk about it?

53:54.698 --> 53:56.932
You know, one day
in the activities room...

53:56.934 --> 53:59.902
-Mm-hmm.
-...I met this woman.

53:59.904 --> 54:01.971
-Sheryl is her name.
-Mm-hmm.

54:01.973 --> 54:05.541
And uh, uh,
that's when it happened.

54:07.244 --> 54:08.744
What?
What happened?

54:12.649 --> 54:16.018
-I got an erection.
-What? Oh, my God!

54:16.020 --> 54:18.020
Don't laugh.

54:18.022 --> 54:22.458
I haven't had an erection
since Molly got sick.

54:22.460 --> 54:25.728
I mean, I felt young,
and I felt excited.
I was...

54:25.730 --> 54:27.596
Well, that's good.

54:27.598 --> 54:29.632
Why does that
have to be a secret?

54:29.634 --> 54:32.268
That wasn't a secret.

54:32.270 --> 54:33.802
Oh, what's the secret?

54:33.804 --> 54:35.871
The secret was...

54:38.041 --> 54:39.942
I slept with Sheryl.

54:39.944 --> 54:41.343
What?

54:41.345 --> 54:43.312
We had sex.

54:43.314 --> 54:47.483
But the sad thing is,
I-I failed.

54:48.985 --> 54:52.388
You um, you couldn't
keep your...

54:52.390 --> 54:54.456
No, I was hard as a rock.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.991
I was like a teenager

54:55.993 --> 54:58.661
looking at pictures
in a magazine.

54:58.663 --> 55:02.665
But I c...
I couldn't finish.

55:06.303 --> 55:08.037
I...

55:08.039 --> 55:10.439
I collapsed.

55:10.441 --> 55:14.576
And when I came to,
she was gone.

55:14.578 --> 55:16.845
Well,

55:16.847 --> 55:19.315
at least you didn't have
a heart attack.

55:19.317 --> 55:21.083
Small consolation.

55:22.686 --> 55:25.654
If I were to die right now,

55:25.656 --> 55:29.625
I think it would...
it would be a relief.

55:31.628 --> 55:34.563
When I was little, um,

55:34.565 --> 55:37.866
I used to believe
that when you died,

55:37.868 --> 55:41.570
you just dreamt about
all the great things
that happened in your life.

55:41.572 --> 55:44.840
So... then when you
died in your dream,

55:44.842 --> 55:47.409
you just woke up
into another dream,

55:47.411 --> 55:49.812
and you just kept
living your life

55:49.814 --> 55:53.015
over and over
and over again.

55:53.017 --> 55:54.950
That sounds pretty nice.

55:57.520 --> 55:59.888
What do you think happens
when you die?

55:59.890 --> 56:02.358
Nothing.

56:05.428 --> 56:07.429
Does that scare you?

56:09.699 --> 56:12.368
Let's not talk
about death, okay?

56:15.773 --> 56:17.673
Okay.

56:19.743 --> 56:21.944
How would you like
to be adopted?

56:23.012 --> 56:24.880
I don't think I would.

56:24.882 --> 56:29.418
I mean, like you, I'd probably
do a little searching...

56:29.420 --> 56:30.986
I'm not talking
about me.

56:30.988 --> 56:32.821
I'm talking about you.

56:32.823 --> 56:34.656
I'm gonna adopt you.

56:35.692 --> 56:37.059
What?

56:37.061 --> 56:39.895
Well, how does one
go about getting

56:39.897 --> 56:43.065
adoption papers
for an old person like me?

56:43.067 --> 56:44.933
-I don't know.
-I'll tell you what.

56:44.935 --> 56:46.135
What?

56:46.137 --> 56:48.771
Forget the adoption papers.

56:48.773 --> 56:51.173
You take Phil and me

56:51.175 --> 56:54.576
out of this establishment

56:54.578 --> 56:56.879
for one day
to have some fun!

56:58.715 --> 57:01.116
All right.
You guys are sprung.

57:03.921 --> 57:05.954

They can't hear you.

57:28.746 --> 57:30.779
Yeah, but they're still bums.
Go on, tell 'em.

57:30.781 --> 57:33.749
-What?
-Go ahead, tell 'em!

57:33.751 --> 57:35.851

57:40.891 --> 57:42.891
I'm glad to be out,

-Yeah, I think so.

Phil?

58:49.126 --> 58:50.792
Hmm?

58:50.794 --> 58:52.261
What?

58:52.263 --> 58:54.696
We gotta get back
to Cliffside.

58:54.698 --> 58:56.098
Oh, no.

58:56.100 --> 58:57.833
I don't want
to go there. No.

58:57.835 --> 59:01.937
Well, you know, I'd rather
not go back right now too.

59:01.939 --> 59:03.839
Where do you want to go?

59:05.074 --> 59:06.675
Anywhere else.

59:11.180 --> 59:14.650
- How's Phil?
- Oh, he fell right to sleep.

59:14.652 --> 59:16.985
I like your place.

59:16.987 --> 59:20.822
Oh, thanks.
I'm working on it.

59:20.824 --> 59:23.091
Are these your parents?

59:23.093 --> 59:25.093
Oh, yeah, the picture
near the chair?

59:25.095 --> 59:27.095
-Yeah.
-Yeah, that's them.

59:27.097 --> 59:29.765
That's the last picture
of the two of them together.

59:29.767 --> 59:32.935
Ah, thank you.

59:43.146 --> 59:45.747
I was just thinking
about a...

59:45.749 --> 59:48.684
a nurse I used to know.

59:48.686 --> 59:51.153
You remind me
of her, actually.

59:51.155 --> 59:54.957
I actually haven't
thought about her in years.

59:54.959 --> 59:57.326
Well, what was her name?

59:57.328 --> 01:00:00.062
Patricia.

01:00:00.064 --> 01:00:03.599
I don't think I've even
said her name out loud

01:00:03.601 --> 01:00:05.634
in God knows how long.

01:00:05.636 --> 01:00:08.370
What-- what makes you
think about her now?

01:00:08.372 --> 01:00:10.038
I don't know.

01:00:10.040 --> 01:00:13.008
Maybe...

01:00:13.010 --> 01:00:15.978
thinking about the hospital...
I don't know...

01:00:15.980 --> 01:00:17.846
Don't know.

01:00:17.848 --> 01:00:20.616
She made a big mistake

01:00:20.618 --> 01:00:23.652
in a medication dose

01:00:23.654 --> 01:00:26.054
on one of my patients.

01:00:26.056 --> 01:00:29.024
That was
a long time ago.

01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:33.295
I haven't talked about her

01:00:33.297 --> 01:00:35.931
to anybody

01:00:35.933 --> 01:00:38.400
for a very long time.

01:00:41.705 --> 01:00:43.672
When did this happen?

01:00:43.674 --> 01:00:45.340
Years ago.

01:00:52.115 --> 01:00:54.383
One day she vanished.

01:00:54.385 --> 01:00:57.252
I never knew
where she went.

01:00:57.254 --> 01:01:00.355
She never looked me up.

01:01:00.357 --> 01:01:02.124
And, uh...

01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:07.829
Well, it's probably
for the best.

01:01:44.200 --> 01:01:48.003
Molly, there's something
I need to tell you.

01:01:48.005 --> 01:01:50.839
Remember that woman
that I told you about

01:01:50.841 --> 01:01:52.841
who was searching
for her father?

01:01:52.843 --> 01:01:56.244
W-woman? Father?

01:01:56.246 --> 01:01:59.414
Years ago, I had
a brief affair with a nurse

01:01:59.416 --> 01:02:02.350
-who vanished and...
-Affair?

01:02:02.352 --> 01:02:05.787
Yes, Molly, but it was
a long time ago.

01:02:07.056 --> 01:02:09.057
Affair, Abe?

01:02:09.059 --> 01:02:10.992
Yes.

01:02:10.994 --> 01:02:13.895
Well,

01:02:13.897 --> 01:02:17.099
it's possible
that she had a child.

01:02:17.101 --> 01:02:19.835
Child?

01:02:19.837 --> 01:02:22.137
Yes, my child.

01:02:26.342 --> 01:02:28.276
Never found it.

01:02:29.912 --> 01:02:32.781
Never found it, Abe.

01:02:34.752 --> 01:02:37.753
Close under the grass.

01:02:37.755 --> 01:02:39.755
This is called "five-card draw."

01:02:39.757 --> 01:02:41.857
Each participant
gets five cards.

01:02:41.859 --> 01:02:44.392
The person
with a strong hand

01:02:44.394 --> 01:02:46.928
can make the first bet.

01:02:46.930 --> 01:02:48.363
I think I can open.

01:02:48.365 --> 01:02:51.500
Uh, five chips.

01:02:51.502 --> 01:02:53.435
-Okay, um...
-You have to put in five.

01:02:53.437 --> 01:02:54.870
-Good.
-Five.

01:02:54.872 --> 01:02:56.972
Five. Okay.

01:02:56.974 --> 01:02:58.974
What do you got?

01:02:58.976 --> 01:03:02.310
Uh, I got a straight.

01:03:02.312 --> 01:03:04.880
Oh!

01:03:07.450 --> 01:03:09.885
Three tens.

01:03:09.887 --> 01:03:11.987
A pair of aces.

01:03:11.989 --> 01:03:15.056
Whoa, wait. Hey, Phil,
I'm not sure if that's...

01:03:15.058 --> 01:03:17.559
You know, I should've
had second thoughts

01:03:17.561 --> 01:03:19.194
about playing poker
with you.

01:03:19.196 --> 01:03:22.864
Yeah, you've fallen
into the same pit

01:03:22.866 --> 01:03:24.499
that many have fallen in.

01:03:24.501 --> 01:03:26.201
Nobody can beat me.

01:03:31.007 --> 01:03:32.140
Two of a kind.

01:03:34.577 --> 01:03:37.813
There you see it.
Full house. Aces over jacks.

01:03:37.815 --> 01:03:40.182
I win again.

01:03:40.184 --> 01:03:42.217
Royal flush.

01:03:45.588 --> 01:03:48.557
Hey, he's got
all the chips.

01:03:48.559 --> 01:03:51.426
I beat everybody.
I always beat everybody.
Nobody beats me.

01:03:51.428 --> 01:03:54.863
Look, I'm getting tired.

01:03:54.865 --> 01:03:57.165
I would like
to go to my room.

01:03:57.167 --> 01:03:59.901
Would you help me, Angela?
I want to talk to you.

01:03:59.903 --> 01:04:01.570
-Yeah.
-I'll see you later, Abe-y.

01:04:01.572 --> 01:04:03.138
Okay.

01:04:07.076 --> 01:04:10.345
-Thanks, honey.
-Yeah.

01:04:10.347 --> 01:04:14.316
Uh, I got something
to tell ya.

01:04:14.318 --> 01:04:16.451
What is it?

01:04:19.355 --> 01:04:21.323
I'm your father.

01:04:23.292 --> 01:04:24.559
Uh, say that again?

01:04:24.561 --> 01:04:26.962
I am your father.

01:04:29.198 --> 01:04:31.266
I'm confused.

01:04:31.268 --> 01:04:33.201
You came looking
for your father.

01:04:33.203 --> 01:04:35.203
Came looking here.

01:04:35.205 --> 01:04:38.373
You found him.
I hope you're not mad at me.

01:04:38.375 --> 01:04:41.243
Why didn't you tell me
the first time that I asked you?

01:04:41.245 --> 01:04:43.111
I don't know.
I just,

01:04:43.113 --> 01:04:44.946
I'm no good at handling
anything like this,

01:04:44.948 --> 01:04:47.082
and I always run away
from everything.

01:04:47.084 --> 01:04:48.950
Jerk.

01:04:48.952 --> 01:04:51.453
I had an affair
with your mother,

01:04:51.455 --> 01:04:54.923
and she was married to
a serviceman who was overseas.

01:04:54.925 --> 01:04:56.958
She had the baby

01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:59.060
and gave it up
for adoption

01:04:59.062 --> 01:05:02.097
before he came back,
and I never saw her again.

01:05:03.266 --> 01:05:04.966
What was her name?

01:05:04.968 --> 01:05:07.402
Maria Picardi.

01:05:10.473 --> 01:05:12.974
How do you know for sure
that I am your daughter?

01:05:12.976 --> 01:05:14.442
It all fits.

01:05:14.444 --> 01:05:16.444
The age.

01:05:16.446 --> 01:05:19.214
You came here to find me.
You're obviously Italian.

01:05:19.216 --> 01:05:21.116
Do you know
who wrote the note?

01:05:21.118 --> 01:05:22.984
I don't know that.

01:05:24.954 --> 01:05:26.588
Do you know who handled
the adoption?

01:05:26.590 --> 01:05:28.390
Then that way
I could find my mother.

01:05:28.392 --> 01:05:30.258
I don't.

01:05:31.327 --> 01:05:33.228
Oh, my God.

01:05:33.230 --> 01:05:35.363
Angela?

01:05:35.365 --> 01:05:37.599
-Yeah?
-I'm dying.

01:05:37.601 --> 01:05:40.702
There's very little
time left.

01:05:43.005 --> 01:05:45.173
I want you
to take this.

01:05:45.175 --> 01:05:46.474
It's yours.

01:05:46.476 --> 01:05:48.276
I have no one else
to give it to.

01:05:56.218 --> 01:05:58.620
Where did you get
all of this money?

01:05:58.622 --> 01:06:00.355
I made a lot of money
in my life,

01:06:00.357 --> 01:06:02.123
and a lot of my money
came in cash.

01:06:02.125 --> 01:06:03.658
I couldn't even put it
into the bank.

01:06:03.660 --> 01:06:05.327
I can't.
I can't take your money.

01:06:05.329 --> 01:06:07.729
Oh, you can't tell me that.
Don't do that.

01:06:07.731 --> 01:06:10.465
Give me a chance
to make it up.
I gave you nothing.

01:06:10.467 --> 01:06:14.135
Just give me a chance
maybe in some little way,

01:06:14.137 --> 01:06:16.604
to make it up to you
that I wasn't around.

01:06:16.606 --> 01:06:17.973
Just a little bit.

01:06:29.118 --> 01:06:32.454
Okay, take a big deep
breath and hold it.

01:06:34.190 --> 01:06:36.491
Let it go.

01:06:36.493 --> 01:06:39.327
Deep breath again.

01:06:39.329 --> 01:06:42.097
Okay, that's good.
Okay.

01:06:42.099 --> 01:06:44.366
Now I'll just
check your eyes.

01:06:46.535 --> 01:06:48.436
All right.

01:06:48.438 --> 01:06:51.272
-What's the verdict, Doctor?
-Well, the good news is,

01:06:51.274 --> 01:06:55.176
Grollman's treatment hasn't
caused any bad side effects.

01:06:56.746 --> 01:06:58.680
I'm no doctor, but...

01:06:58.682 --> 01:07:01.082
I feel
it can't be good.

01:07:01.084 --> 01:07:03.251
Well, you're
going to be all right.

01:07:03.253 --> 01:07:05.687
So I'm not gonna die, Abe?

01:07:05.689 --> 01:07:08.590
I didn't say that.

01:07:08.592 --> 01:07:11.092
But don't worry
about me, Abe.

01:07:11.094 --> 01:07:14.162
I'm taking care of myself.
I found someone to
look after me.

01:07:14.164 --> 01:07:15.663
What do you mean?

01:07:15.665 --> 01:07:19.067
Angela.
She's my daughter.

01:07:22.071 --> 01:07:23.571
Wait a...

01:07:23.573 --> 01:07:26.641
Yeah. We met.

01:07:26.643 --> 01:07:29.110
I told her all of my secrets.
I gave her all of my money.

01:07:29.112 --> 01:07:31.212
Is she really your daughter?

01:07:31.214 --> 01:07:32.747
She's my daughter.
I gave her all my money.

01:07:32.749 --> 01:07:36.484
I'm talking flesh-and-blood
daughter, daughter!

01:07:36.486 --> 01:07:39.521
How the hell would I know
that she's my flesh-and-blood
daughter, daughter?

01:07:39.523 --> 01:07:41.623
You know how many women
I've screwed?

01:07:41.625 --> 01:07:44.225
I figured
somewhere along the way,
I must've had a child.

01:07:44.227 --> 01:07:46.594
Did she ask you any questions
about her mother

01:07:46.596 --> 01:07:50.432
or about the conditions
of the adoption?

01:07:50.434 --> 01:07:52.300
Yes.

01:07:52.302 --> 01:07:54.202
I made it all up
so she'd believe it,

01:07:54.204 --> 01:07:55.770
just like
when you're bluffing

01:07:55.772 --> 01:07:58.106
and you didn't pull
the inside straight.

01:07:58.108 --> 01:07:59.574
Are you serious?

01:07:59.576 --> 01:08:02.777
This isn't
a poker game, Phil.

01:08:06.415 --> 01:08:09.384
I've got a confession
to make.

01:08:09.386 --> 01:08:13.588
I had a... a wild hope
that she was my daughter.

01:08:13.590 --> 01:08:17.125
How the hell could
she be your daughter?

01:08:17.127 --> 01:08:20.562
Years ago,
I had an affair with a nurse.

01:08:20.564 --> 01:08:23.665
She might have had a child
that she put up for adoption

01:08:23.667 --> 01:08:26.533
without my knowledge,
that's how.

01:08:27.837 --> 01:08:29.837
You can't take her
away from me, Abe.

01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:31.171
It's all I've got.

01:08:31.174 --> 01:08:33.207
Of course not.
I would never do that.

01:08:33.210 --> 01:08:34.609
I've got no family,

01:08:34.611 --> 01:08:36.277
I've got no children,

01:08:36.279 --> 01:08:39.214
and I don't
want to die alone.

01:08:39.216 --> 01:08:42.517
I'm here for you, Phil.
I am.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:46.821
Thanks, Abe.

01:08:46.823 --> 01:08:48.790
Oh, God.

01:08:59.535 --> 01:09:03.805
You know, Abe? It feels like
we've known each other

01:09:03.807 --> 01:09:06.808
longer than this little time
we've spent here.

01:09:06.810 --> 01:09:09.377
You know, maybe when...
when you get old,

01:09:09.379 --> 01:09:11.712
time slows down
the way...

01:09:11.715 --> 01:09:15.283
the way it did when
we were kids, you know?

01:09:15.285 --> 01:09:17.819
We're two old men, Abe.

01:09:17.821 --> 01:09:20.388
There's no escaping that.

01:09:22.791 --> 01:09:26.261
So many things
we can't do anymore,

01:09:26.263 --> 01:09:28.897
so little
to look forward to,

01:09:28.899 --> 01:09:30.899
yet we still try
to live our lives,

01:09:30.901 --> 01:09:33.501
scared to death of dying,

01:09:33.502 --> 01:09:36.504
trying to stay young
with some crazy ideas.

01:09:39.942 --> 01:09:40.841
But you know what, Abe?

01:09:45.481 --> 01:09:47.615
We're still the same
as they are,

01:09:47.617 --> 01:09:51.286
no matter how young they are,
because we're friends.

01:09:51.287 --> 01:09:53.888
Goddamn it,
we're better than they are.

01:09:53.890 --> 01:09:56.925
-You know what
I say to them, Abe?
-What do you say to them?

01:09:56.927 --> 01:09:59.394
Fuck 'em, I say.
I say, fuck 'em!

01:09:59.396 --> 01:10:01.596
-Fuck 'em.
-Fuck 'em all.

01:10:01.598 --> 01:10:03.431
-Fuck 'em all!
-Yeah.

01:10:08.837 --> 01:10:11.539
I'm really tired.

01:10:11.541 --> 01:10:14.676
I have to rest
a little bit now.

01:10:17.514 --> 01:10:19.581
Thank you, Doctor.

01:10:24.553 --> 01:10:26.754
Don't call me "doctor."

01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.934
-Mr. Grollman.
-Doctor.

01:10:39.936 --> 01:10:42.637
I have a proposition
for you.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:44.939
What's your proposition?

01:10:44.941 --> 01:10:46.908
You have
a nurse working here

01:10:46.910 --> 01:10:48.977
who is adopted,

01:10:48.979 --> 01:10:52.547
and she's searching
for her biological parents.

01:10:52.549 --> 01:10:55.950
Now she recently got
a note that said

01:10:55.952 --> 01:10:58.920
her father is living here,

01:10:58.922 --> 01:11:00.989
so I'd like to help her.

01:11:00.991 --> 01:11:03.658
I'd like to take samples

01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:06.561
from all the men here
for DNA testing.

01:11:07.997 --> 01:11:10.598
There's no way
I can do that.

01:11:10.600 --> 01:11:13.501
Besides, we'd need
permission for the samples.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:15.903
Well, they're
just throat swabs. I mean...

01:11:15.905 --> 01:11:19.540
The answer is no, Doctor.

01:11:19.542 --> 01:11:22.510
If that's
why you came here,

01:11:22.512 --> 01:11:25.446
you can leave now.

01:11:25.448 --> 01:11:27.815
Let me ask you
a question.

01:11:27.817 --> 01:11:30.051
Did you have
to get permission

01:11:30.053 --> 01:11:32.787
to give cancer cells
to people?

01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:40.962
Cancer cells
are immortal.

01:11:40.964 --> 01:11:43.431
Drinking them

01:11:43.433 --> 01:11:45.433
will vaccinate

01:11:45.435 --> 01:11:47.435
with immortal factors

01:11:47.437 --> 01:11:49.337
and prevent aging.

01:11:49.339 --> 01:11:50.738
Someone has
to do something.

01:11:50.740 --> 01:11:53.675
You can see what it's
like to get old.

01:11:53.677 --> 01:11:57.745
Is that why you say
you hate old people?

01:11:57.747 --> 01:12:01.616
I don't hate the people.

01:12:01.618 --> 01:12:04.085
I hate watching them
get old.

01:12:05.387 --> 01:12:07.322
The cells are safe.

01:12:07.324 --> 01:12:08.956
They're in
an incomplete form,

01:12:08.958 --> 01:12:12.427
made by a professor
at the medical center.

01:12:12.429 --> 01:12:16.464
I was a scientist in his lab
before I came here.

01:12:16.466 --> 01:12:20.735
My experiments failed.
I had to leave.

01:12:20.737 --> 01:12:22.904
Well, I think that, uh,

01:12:22.906 --> 01:12:25.907
if people found out
what you were doing,

01:12:25.909 --> 01:12:29.010
you'd also have
to leave Cliffside.

01:12:32.414 --> 01:12:35.583
Make it happen,
Mr. Grollman.

01:12:39.855 --> 01:12:42.657
This won't hurt.
Just open your mouth wide.

01:12:42.659 --> 01:12:45.393
I'm just going to get
the inside of your mouth.

01:12:48.931 --> 01:12:50.064
Very good.

01:12:53.135 --> 01:12:55.536
All right.

01:12:55.538 --> 01:12:58.373
Very good. Thank you.

01:13:14.456 --> 01:13:17.859
I have to...

01:13:17.861 --> 01:13:20.828
figure out how I'm going to
give that money back to Phil.

01:13:22.097 --> 01:13:24.499
No, you can't do that.

01:13:24.501 --> 01:13:27.135
I promised him
I wasn't going to tell you.

01:13:27.137 --> 01:13:29.470
No, I... I have
to give it back to him,

01:13:29.472 --> 01:13:31.572
because...

01:13:31.574 --> 01:13:34.475
I'm not sure that
I'm gonna be here anymore.

01:13:36.011 --> 01:13:38.179
What are you saying?

01:13:38.181 --> 01:13:39.847
It's time for me

01:13:39.849 --> 01:13:43.785
to stop my search
and to leave.

01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.556
No, no.
You can't do that.

01:13:48.558 --> 01:13:52.927
You are on the verge of
finding out who your father is.

01:13:52.929 --> 01:13:55.163
Wh-what are you
talking about?

01:13:55.165 --> 01:13:58.433
I wanted to surprise you,
but because of me,

01:13:58.435 --> 01:14:00.435
Grollman has allowed
DNA tests

01:14:00.437 --> 01:14:02.170
on all the men
at this facility.

01:14:02.172 --> 01:14:05.907
Is that why they did
a throat swab on me?

01:14:05.909 --> 01:14:08.009
Yes.

01:14:08.011 --> 01:14:10.778
You had no right
to do that.

01:14:12.114 --> 01:14:15.583
Well, I thought
that's what you wanted.

01:14:15.585 --> 01:14:18.152
It's not
your choice to make.

01:14:18.154 --> 01:14:21.189
I thought I was
doing you a favor.

01:14:21.191 --> 01:14:23.057
Oh, God.

01:14:24.793 --> 01:14:27.528
I know that you thought
that you were helping.

01:15:22.684 --> 01:15:25.853
Tell Dr. Mandelbaum
that the results are in.

01:15:30.926 --> 01:15:32.059
Abe...

01:15:33.929 --> 01:15:36.297
I think
it's all over.

01:15:43.105 --> 01:15:45.306
Fuck 'em all.

01:15:45.308 --> 01:15:47.074
Fuck 'em all!

01:15:50.112 --> 01:15:52.280
Phil...

01:15:52.282 --> 01:15:55.249
Oh, Angela,

01:15:55.251 --> 01:15:57.952
my beautiful daughter.

01:15:57.954 --> 01:16:00.621
I'm so glad

01:16:00.623 --> 01:16:04.125
I was able to do
something for you.

01:16:07.162 --> 01:16:09.997
I'm heading for that
big poker game.

01:16:13.001 --> 01:16:15.603
I hope you take good cards.

01:16:16.705 --> 01:16:18.239
Don't worry.

01:16:22.344 --> 01:16:24.312
I can always cheat.

01:16:40.829 --> 01:16:42.830
He was my friend.

01:16:45.300 --> 01:16:47.301
He could have been
my father.

01:16:57.312 --> 01:16:59.914
Here it is.

01:17:01.183 --> 01:17:04.018
No more search.

01:17:04.020 --> 01:17:06.220
No more nightmares.

01:17:06.222 --> 01:17:07.788
Now you'll know

01:17:07.790 --> 01:17:11.892
if Phil was your father
or if I was your father

01:17:11.894 --> 01:17:14.729
or someone on the fourth floor
is your father.

01:17:17.966 --> 01:17:20.301
I gotta tell you,
I'm nervous.

01:17:22.170 --> 01:17:24.171
I'm not nervous, Abe.

01:19:55.925 --> 01:19:59.059
-Wh-what happened to me?
-You had a heart attack.

01:19:59.061 --> 01:20:02.062
-How's Molly?
-She's fine.

01:20:02.064 --> 01:20:03.831
We told her where you are

01:20:03.833 --> 01:20:05.933
and that you're getting
good care.

01:20:07.235 --> 01:20:09.370
How are you?

01:20:09.372 --> 01:20:11.272
Any regrets?

01:20:13.275 --> 01:20:15.409
No.

01:20:16.578 --> 01:20:18.312
How's he doing?

01:20:18.314 --> 01:20:20.314
I think he's doing okay.

01:20:21.349 --> 01:20:23.350
Grollman.

01:20:24.519 --> 01:20:26.520
I must really be sick.

01:20:28.423 --> 01:20:31.425
-Did he give you the envelope?
-I tore it up.

01:20:33.395 --> 01:20:36.931
Look what you put me through,
Dr. Mandelbaum.

01:20:36.933 --> 01:20:39.400
You're not
a bad guy, Grollman.

01:20:39.402 --> 01:20:42.036
I'm really sorry

01:20:42.038 --> 01:20:45.506
that your c-cancer
treatments didn't work.

01:20:50.278 --> 01:20:52.479
You know,

01:20:52.481 --> 01:20:56.417
I don't hate what happens
to old people.

01:20:58.920 --> 01:21:01.388
I'm glad I got to be old.

01:21:05.227 --> 01:21:07.228
I love life.

01:21:22.577 --> 01:21:25.079
Thank you.

01:21:35.657 --> 01:21:38.058
I'll, uh, leave you to it.

01:21:38.060 --> 01:21:40.160
Thank you. Thank you.

01:21:48.503 --> 01:21:50.504
Are you in pain?

01:21:50.506 --> 01:21:53.040
No. No pain.

01:21:56.144 --> 01:21:58.045
Just happy.

01:22:00.949 --> 01:22:02.149
Very happy.

01:22:03.985 --> 01:22:05.586
You're gonna make it, Abe.

01:22:05.588 --> 01:22:08.088
No.

01:22:08.090 --> 01:22:10.024
No.

01:22:10.026 --> 01:22:12.359
No, Angela.

01:22:12.361 --> 01:22:15.195
My life's over,

01:22:15.197 --> 01:22:17.364
and nothing
can save it.

01:22:19.434 --> 01:22:22.236
All the happiness,

01:22:22.238 --> 01:22:25.606
all the pain,
all the years--

01:22:25.608 --> 01:22:31.245
Everything is
at its final place.

01:22:31.247 --> 01:22:33.180
Nothing can...

01:22:34.449 --> 01:22:38.352
Nothing can change
the balance anymore.

01:22:39.654 --> 01:22:42.423
I'm here with you.

01:22:46.494 --> 01:22:48.963
I love you so much.

01:22:50.398 --> 01:22:52.733
Angela, I love you.

01:22:56.738 --> 01:22:59.673
I love you too, Abe.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:05.679
Take care of Molly
for me, please,

01:23:05.681 --> 01:23:08.182
and-and look for...

01:23:08.184 --> 01:23:10.584
P-Patricia Rossi.

01:23:14.689 --> 01:23:18.525
I'm on my way to meet Phil

01:23:18.527 --> 01:23:20.461
for...

01:23:21.596 --> 01:23:24.098
for a big poker game.

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:30.197
Hi, Molly.

01:24:32.734 --> 01:24:34.735
Hi.
How are you feeling?

01:24:34.737 --> 01:24:38.472
Oh, it... it's a day.

01:24:38.474 --> 01:24:41.275
Actually um,

01:24:41.277 --> 01:24:44.378
I have something
for you.

01:24:50.351 --> 01:24:52.352
Oh!

01:24:54.289 --> 01:24:56.457
Would you like to try it on?

01:24:59.694 --> 01:25:01.428
Oh!

01:25:04.866 --> 01:25:06.733
Does it fit?

01:25:08.169 --> 01:25:10.604
-Oh...
-It looks beautiful.

01:25:10.606 --> 01:25:12.473
Oh!

01:25:12.475 --> 01:25:14.341
Do you like it?

01:26:06.427 --> 01:26:08.595
Hi, Mom.
