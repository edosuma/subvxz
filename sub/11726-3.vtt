WEBVTT

00:16.466 --> 00:18.019
All right, oars up.

00:21.039 --> 00:23.039
Welcome to Rocky Point, boys.

00:23.955 --> 00:25.084
Bring her in.

00:26.361 --> 00:28.361
(men chattering)

00:29.836 --> 00:30.809
Another one.

00:31.736 --> 00:32.798
Got it.

00:34.549 --> 00:36.549
- What now?
- We go visit an old friend.

00:37.724 --> 00:38.461
Come on.

00:40.520 --> 00:44.656
Our target lives in the hamlet
known as Rocky Point.

00:45.773 --> 00:47.807
He's a former resident of Setauket

00:48.856 --> 00:50.324
using his wealth and standing

00:50.359 --> 00:52.824
to masquerade as a Tory,

00:52.860 --> 00:55.410
hiding in plain sight.

00:58.912 --> 01:01.913
Today we rein in this traitor

01:01.965 --> 01:04.315
quietly poisoning the countryside.

01:04.918 --> 01:08.692
His name is Samuel Culper.

01:10.390 --> 01:11.756
- <i> (door bursts open)</i>
- (screams)

01:11.808 --> 01:12.974
Don't move! Don't move!

01:13.010 --> 01:16.728
- Don't move!
- (guns cocking)

01:18.482 --> 01:20.231
Caleb Brewster?

01:20.267 --> 01:22.434
Hello, Beekman.

01:22.436 --> 01:24.152
You men will leave with me.

01:24.187 --> 01:26.068
The rest of the unit
will keep their posts.

01:26.606 --> 01:28.461
We shall return after daybreak tomorrow.

01:28.621 --> 01:31.493
Sir, all this for one man?

01:31.528 --> 01:34.829
Kill a Queen's Ranger? Are you insane?

01:34.865 --> 01:38.283
A touch. But I wouldn't worry
yourself about this one.

01:38.285 --> 01:40.018
<i>He'll be dead before
he knows what hit him.</i>

01:40.070 --> 01:43.193
I imagine it will be quite
the surprise for him.

01:44.674 --> 01:45.840
Fall out!

01:51.999 --> 01:54.132
(Robert growls)

01:55.805 --> 01:56.785
Ah.

01:58.271 --> 02:00.337
Dead man marching.

I've never spent a night
away from Thomas.

03:26.200 --> 03:27.860
You must think I'm foolish.

03:28.920 --> 03:30.924
A mother's concern is never foolish.

03:33.708 --> 03:37.564
In fact, your sensibility
is why I'm here.

03:39.096 --> 03:40.229
I need your help.

03:48.556 --> 03:51.223
I'm doing everything I can
to broker a truce

03:51.225 --> 03:53.025
between Abraham and Major Hewlett.

03:53.060 --> 03:55.060
- I doubt that can be done.
- But I've done it, Mary.

03:55.588 --> 03:57.062
Nearly, that is.

03:57.064 --> 04:02.151
Hewlett has agreed to let you, Abe,
and Thomas leave Setauket unharmed.

04:02.203 --> 04:05.404
But Abe has no plans
to honor this agreement.

04:05.456 --> 04:07.325
In fact, he plans to betray it

04:07.909 --> 04:09.408
and murder Hewlett.

04:11.495 --> 04:14.880
The major is using me
as collateral against my husband.

04:14.916 --> 04:17.166
Forgive me if my sympathy
for him is lacking.

04:17.218 --> 04:19.250
I'm not appealing to your sympathy.

04:19.303 --> 04:22.520
Abe has no plans to leave
even after the deed is done.

04:23.174 --> 04:26.725
He is determined to stay
and continue his work for Washington

04:26.761 --> 04:28.928
no matter how much danger it puts him in

04:28.980 --> 04:31.694
or you or Thomas.

04:33.684 --> 04:35.125
Reason with him, Mary.

04:37.104 --> 04:38.685
He won't listen to me anymore.

04:39.106 --> 04:41.106
- Perhaps he'll listen to you.
- I believe in Abraham.

04:41.108 --> 04:42.942
And I have faith
that he will protect us.

04:42.944 --> 04:45.880
If you don't share that belief, maybe
it's you who should leave Setauket.

04:47.127 --> 04:48.846
Maybe that's what's best for everyone.

04:55.122 --> 04:57.289
<i>(sawing)</i>

04:59.760 --> 05:02.261
<i>(men chattering)</i>

05:10.805 --> 05:12.554
Reverend. Morning.

05:12.607 --> 05:13.655
Ah, Benjamin.

05:13.680 --> 05:15.415
Will you be traveling
along with the camp?

05:15.443 --> 05:17.226
No, no, I'm off to Fairfield.

05:17.278 --> 05:18.560
What, New Jersey?

05:18.613 --> 05:21.280
Yeah, the good Reverend Martin

05:21.315 --> 05:23.782
has been ministering to my home
church in my stead.

05:23.818 --> 05:26.151
He hasn't been paid in quite some time.

05:26.153 --> 05:28.654
Riding out after the morning
benediction to see it done.

05:28.656 --> 05:30.789
That means you'll be crossing
through no man's land.

05:30.825 --> 05:32.291
That's far too dangerous.

05:32.326 --> 05:35.628
I can't abandon my duties
because the road is rough.

05:35.663 --> 05:38.797
Reverend, you haven't read
the scouting reports.

05:38.833 --> 05:41.967
Tory cowboys hunt
for men traveling alone.

05:42.003 --> 05:44.219
Let me send an escort along with you.

05:44.255 --> 05:46.171
I've made the trip before, my son.

05:46.173 --> 05:50.059
Don't worry. I'll be back before
the camp reaches Middle Brook.

05:51.512 --> 05:55.681
<i>Now, let's begin with
the words of salm 23.</i>

05:55.733 --> 05:59.768
"The Lord is my shepherd.
I shall not want.

05:59.820 --> 06:02.271
He maketh me to lie down
in green pastures.

06:02.323 --> 06:04.857
<i>He leadeth me beside the still waters.</i>

06:04.859 --> 06:07.526
<i>He restoreth my soul.</i>

06:10.915 --> 06:13.782
<i>He leadeth me in the paths
of righteousness</i>

06:13.834 --> 06:15.334
<i>for His name's sake.</i>

06:15.369 --> 06:19.038
<i>Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,</i>

06:19.090 --> 06:21.707
<i>I will fear no evil</i>

06:21.759 --> 06:24.376
<i>for Thou art with me."</i>

06:25.796 --> 06:27.846
(whickers, snorts)

07:23.154 --> 07:24.853
<i>(door opens)</i>

07:32.163 --> 07:34.403
- Anything?
- Not yet.

07:34.915 --> 07:37.282
The men are patrolling
the main route into town

07:37.334 --> 07:40.119
and they're to report to me
any news of Simcoe's return.

07:40.617 --> 07:42.121
Or lack thereof.

07:42.173 --> 07:45.124
I know this is difficult, waiting,

07:45.126 --> 07:47.042
but try not to worry.

07:47.094 --> 07:49.294
I have faith we'll hear the right news.

07:49.346 --> 07:50.913
It's not that. It's...

07:53.634 --> 07:55.350
I never gave you an answer

07:56.473 --> 07:58.804
when we spoke before
about your proposal.

07:58.856 --> 07:59.950
Oh.

08:01.149 --> 08:03.442
I understand. I know
these things take time.

08:03.477 --> 08:04.905
I have considered it.

08:07.233 --> 08:09.148
And I do wish to marry you.

08:10.673 --> 08:12.534
Oh.

08:14.288 --> 08:17.489
But if we are to live
as husband and wife,

08:17.491 --> 08:19.416
it can't be here in Setauket.

08:20.995 --> 08:23.378
But you... you live here.

08:26.633 --> 08:27.721
What's this?

08:28.085 --> 08:29.185
It's from my husband.

08:30.004 --> 08:31.777
From Selah.

08:32.256 --> 08:36.424
He's in Philadelphia now
and wishes to remarry.

08:36.477 --> 08:39.260
He's arranged to purchase a divorce

08:39.313 --> 08:40.943
and has asked me to sign.

08:42.515 --> 08:45.081
The truth is I received this weeks ago

08:45.736 --> 08:49.071
and I've been busy pretending I didn't.

08:50.350 --> 08:52.524
But now with things as they
are between you and me,

08:52.526 --> 08:53.942
I just... I can't...

08:53.994 --> 08:55.694
He's asking you to assume the fault.

08:55.696 --> 08:59.068
And to confess to committing
adultery with Abraham Woodhull.

09:01.418 --> 09:03.252
Well, we will not concede
to this blackmail.

09:03.287 --> 09:05.454
Selah Strong is a traitor to the Crown

09:05.506 --> 09:07.039
and we can petition the magistrate

09:07.091 --> 09:08.790
for a divorce on the
grounds of desertion.

09:08.843 --> 09:11.126
- Judge Woodhull despises me.
- No, not at all.

09:11.178 --> 09:13.128
He holds me in no favor.

09:13.180 --> 09:14.930
And the truth is I did commit adultery.

09:14.965 --> 09:17.716
And I won't allow
my shame to become yours.

09:17.768 --> 09:22.221
Anna, nothing you can do
can cause me to feel shame.

09:22.223 --> 09:23.460
Nothing.

09:28.062 --> 09:30.229
If you truly mean that...

09:32.859 --> 09:34.732
you'll go away with me.

09:35.291 --> 09:36.401
Where?

09:36.453 --> 09:37.651
To your home.

09:38.676 --> 09:39.963
To Scotland.

09:41.492 --> 09:43.408
But you'd still be married.

09:43.410 --> 09:45.322
We'd be guilty of bigamy.

09:45.796 --> 09:48.843
That wouldn't follow us
across the ocean.

09:49.383 --> 09:51.800
We can start a new life together.

09:53.337 --> 09:55.387
This is our chance, Edmund.

09:57.308 --> 09:59.035
Then we shall seize it.

10:07.935 --> 10:11.236
<i>(birds screeching)</i>

10:14.491 --> 10:16.241
(horse snorts)

10:48.609 --> 10:51.531
You've strayed from the path, Reverend.

10:52.279 --> 10:54.363
Benjamin. What are you doing here?

10:54.398 --> 10:56.787
We received word
that you were a traitor,

10:57.484 --> 10:59.284
but now I have the proof.

11:00.003 --> 11:01.445
Proof?

11:02.406 --> 11:04.489
Oh, no, this... this isn't what...

11:04.491 --> 11:07.242
- let me... let me explain.
- Explain what?

11:07.294 --> 11:10.212
How you were paid
by Royal Governor Tryon

11:10.247 --> 11:13.165
and Mayor Mathews to spy on our camp?

11:13.167 --> 11:14.633
- No.
- No?

11:14.668 --> 11:16.668
Well, perhaps
the contents of that letter

11:16.720 --> 11:18.194
can clear things up, eh?

11:19.723 --> 11:21.340
Why not read it to me?

11:24.895 --> 11:27.646
Read the letter.

11:35.656 --> 11:38.940
(stuttering) "I write to you
with important information

11:38.993 --> 11:41.827
about Washington's movements.

11:44.031 --> 11:47.249
The main army, consisting
of the Virginia, Maryland,

11:47.284 --> 11:49.334
and Pennsylvania brigades...

11:51.288 --> 11:53.363
is moving to Middle Brook

11:54.625 --> 11:56.507
near the Bridgewater Township."

11:56.844 --> 11:58.562
Why?

12:00.047 --> 12:02.371
Why do this, hmm?

12:03.050 --> 12:05.934
Why, for politics? For money?

12:07.855 --> 12:09.866
As an act of grace.

12:11.725 --> 12:15.227
I minister to the sick
and dying every day.

12:15.229 --> 12:16.827
I see their agony

12:17.448 --> 12:19.683
while I pray for their deliverance.

12:22.236 --> 12:23.902
Washington is a fool.

Arnold: <i>General Howe left
this place a pigsty.</i>

12:54.256 --> 12:57.257
Holes in the floorboards.
Garbage in the cellar.

12:57.259 --> 12:58.953
Flies everywhere.

12:59.261 --> 13:02.429
I've restored her to her former glory.

13:02.481 --> 13:04.136
As I did Philadelphia.

13:04.600 --> 13:07.601
Hmm, the spoils of war.

13:07.948 --> 13:09.803
She's quite the prize.

13:11.440 --> 13:13.740
I only hope to provide for Peggy

13:13.775 --> 13:15.152
as well as her father has.

13:15.577 --> 13:19.112
Benedict, you need not worry
yourself to impress my family.

13:19.164 --> 13:21.164
Oh, I'm not sure I agree.

13:21.199 --> 13:24.417
As the eldest sister, I must assure
our youngest is in good hands.

13:24.453 --> 13:27.954
You must forgive Betsy. She takes her
responsibilities very seriously.

13:28.006 --> 13:30.672
As she should. And I concur
with you, Elizabeth.

13:31.009 --> 13:34.307
I want nothing but the best
for my exoneration.

13:34.546 --> 13:36.930
Exoneration? From what?

13:36.965 --> 13:40.467
From the baseless charges that
Joseph Reed sought to tar me with.

13:40.927 --> 13:42.269
General Washington advised me

13:42.304 --> 13:44.638
to apply for a court-martial to
clear my name once and for all,

13:44.690 --> 13:46.356
and, mercy, was he right.

13:46.391 --> 13:48.775
The slanders were referred to a
committee headed by William Paca

13:49.128 --> 13:50.810
and he saw fit to dismiss them all.

13:50.812 --> 13:52.048
How fortunate for you.

13:52.314 --> 13:54.314
Fortune favors the bold, sir...

13:54.366 --> 13:56.950
- <i> (door opens)</i>
- ...and smiles upon the righteous.

13:56.985 --> 14:00.287
I sent Paca a case
of Bourgogne to thank him.

14:00.322 --> 14:02.949
I'm even feeling generous enough to
invite the Honorable Mr. Reed,

14:02.985 --> 14:04.491
-  to dinner tonight.
- <i> (door closes)</i>

14:05.661 --> 14:09.079
Sir, Major Edward Burd has arrived.

14:10.549 --> 14:12.916
- Neddy?
- Neddy.

14:14.227 --> 14:16.219
Arnold: <i>As I said, we
have much to celebrate.</i>

14:16.254 --> 14:18.171
An exoneration and a homecoming.

14:18.173 --> 14:21.057
I can't thank you enough, Betsy.

14:21.093 --> 14:23.343
During the darkest days of my captivity,

14:23.395 --> 14:25.095
your letters kept me going.

14:25.791 --> 14:27.564
How long will you be joining us?

14:27.832 --> 14:29.119
Indefinitely.

14:29.601 --> 14:31.601
General Arnold interceded
with Washington

14:31.653 --> 14:33.403
<i>to grant me a furlough from his staff</i>

14:33.438 --> 14:37.191
so I might finish
my recuperation at home.

14:37.609 --> 14:40.777
I think you will find
the restorative powers

14:40.829 --> 14:43.196
of the Shippen ladies
to be quite an elixir.

14:43.198 --> 14:44.513
<i>(Neddy chuckles)</i>

14:44.538 --> 14:45.487
Neddy.

14:46.668 --> 14:49.753
How... when did you manage this?

14:50.956 --> 14:53.590
I will move the heavens for you.

14:58.380 --> 15:00.880
- (Abe humming)
- (hammering)

15:14.029 --> 15:16.390
It's a shame I can't remember,
isn't it, Sprout, huh?

15:16.865 --> 15:19.699
You know, your grandfather
used to sing that to me

15:19.735 --> 15:21.901
and your uncle before bed.

15:22.251 --> 15:23.486
And you wouldn't think it
to look at him,

15:24.140 --> 15:25.655
but he actually had quite a nice voice.

15:26.581 --> 15:28.908
You want to build the house? Yeah?

15:28.960 --> 15:30.577
Come on.

15:30.579 --> 15:32.662
Come on. Give it a go.

15:32.714 --> 15:34.631
See this nail right here?
Give it a whack.

15:34.666 --> 15:36.049
Go on. There you go.

15:36.084 --> 15:38.051
A little harder, like this.

15:39.755 --> 15:41.087
Right?

15:41.089 --> 15:42.589
There you go.

15:43.394 --> 15:44.495
(grunts)

15:46.344 --> 15:48.428
<i>(horse neighs)</i>

15:53.435 --> 15:54.971
There you go.

15:55.487 --> 15:57.211
(clears throat)

15:59.674 --> 16:01.522
Any word on Simcoe?

16:01.827 --> 16:04.277
He set off this morning.
We won't hear for some time.

16:04.279 --> 16:05.044
All right.

16:07.365 --> 16:08.948
But...

16:09.000 --> 16:10.330
whatever happens,

16:11.253 --> 16:12.952
I've just come here to tell you

16:13.004 --> 16:15.338
that you don't have
to worry about the major.

16:15.594 --> 16:17.674
No, we're not talking about this.

16:17.709 --> 16:19.395
You told me to make a choice.

16:23.298 --> 16:24.513
I have.

16:29.137 --> 16:31.186
There's no one coming for you, Abe.

16:32.035 --> 16:33.546
You really think I'd do that?

16:37.362 --> 16:38.642
All right, then.

16:40.490 --> 16:41.907
Why don't I have to worry?

16:44.035 --> 16:47.120
Because we're going to be married,

16:47.757 --> 16:49.621
Edmund and I, in England.

16:49.658 --> 16:52.575
He'll resign his post here,
then we'll leave from New York.

16:53.033 --> 16:55.294
So you don't have to kill him

16:55.818 --> 16:56.994
because he'll be gone.

16:59.801 --> 17:01.167
What are you doing?

17:01.658 --> 17:02.761
Anna.

17:03.472 --> 17:05.338
- I just told you.
- Why?

17:05.390 --> 17:08.007
You wouldn't listen before.
Why should I explain it now?

17:08.059 --> 17:09.309
What about the ring, hmm?

17:09.344 --> 17:11.426
Townsend signals through the "Gazette."

17:11.480 --> 17:12.657
I'm no longer needed.

17:13.431 --> 17:15.769
What about... what about us?

17:16.845 --> 17:18.762
There is no us, Abe.

17:20.771 --> 17:22.906
- You saw to that.
- Oh, I saw to that?

17:22.941 --> 17:25.407
What, are you doing this just to
spite me? Is that what it is?

17:25.443 --> 17:27.327
- No. - You'd marry a man out of spite?

17:27.362 --> 17:29.195
- It's not about spite.
- Well, what is it about, then?

17:29.247 --> 17:30.607
Love?

17:36.037 --> 17:37.272
Why...

17:37.756 --> 17:39.128
do you love him?

17:41.543 --> 17:44.794
I love him enough...

17:46.548 --> 17:47.968
to save his life.

18:11.907 --> 18:13.406
(grunts)

19:04.292 --> 19:08.344
That's no way to treat a
man of God, Tallmadge.

19:09.217 --> 19:10.883
- (gun cocks)
- No need to move.

19:11.182 --> 19:12.742
<i>You're fine there.</i>

19:14.469 --> 19:15.602
Gamble?

19:15.637 --> 19:17.373
So you do know my name.

19:17.772 --> 19:19.806
Spares me the introduction.

19:20.358 --> 19:24.694
Tell me, Major, what did your
lot do with that fool Shanks?

19:24.729 --> 19:27.207
Hang him? Enlist him?

19:27.649 --> 19:29.654
You were the reverend's contact.

19:30.263 --> 19:32.285
So he was working for André.

19:32.320 --> 19:34.954
<i>We were supposed
to meet today, actually.</i>

19:34.990 --> 19:37.790
Looks like you spared me
that introduction as well.

19:40.045 --> 19:41.577
Move to shore.

19:43.164 --> 19:45.103
Slow and steady.

19:58.229 --> 19:59.957
That's far enough.

20:01.941 --> 20:03.232
Turn around.

20:11.276 --> 20:12.945
Now kneel down.

20:20.368 --> 20:24.120
I am an officer in the Continental Army.

20:24.172 --> 20:27.090
Protocol dictates... (grunts)

20:32.384 --> 20:34.652
- (playing)
- (men chattering)

20:47.263 --> 20:50.464
I bet you never tell your wife about
the old days, do you, Beekman?

20:50.953 --> 20:51.779
<i>No?</i>

20:52.185 --> 20:54.113
When you were the terror of Setauket.

20:54.922 --> 20:55.970
No?

20:56.022 --> 20:59.190
<i>Oh, he used to put cow pies in
mine and Abe and Ben's food.</i>

20:59.225 --> 21:02.943
Used to beat up on us just 'cause
he was bigger and he could.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.310
Well, little Caleb Brewster here,

21:07.678 --> 21:10.401
he ain't so small anymore, is he?

21:10.453 --> 21:12.153
(muffled shouting)

21:13.289 --> 21:15.094
(gasps)

21:15.291 --> 21:17.541
Caleb, please.

21:17.577 --> 21:20.661
Whatever I did, it was a long time ago.

21:20.713 --> 21:23.464
We were young. I was rowdy and...

21:23.499 --> 21:25.833
- And you were an arsehole
and you still are.

21:25.885 --> 21:28.135
- (muffled screaming)
- Caleb: <i> Hey!</i>

21:28.171 --> 21:30.221
- Settle down, you.
- What?

21:30.256 --> 21:31.639
Just trying to have a bit of fun.

21:31.674 --> 21:33.174
Caleb: <i>Yeah, well, I
need you able and ready,</i>

21:33.176 --> 21:34.642
not messing with the ladies, all right?

21:34.677 --> 21:36.927
Can't have you going off like last time.

21:39.148 --> 21:42.399
It might be a while
before Simcoe gets here.

21:42.435 --> 21:44.685
I've got to pass the time somehow.

21:44.687 --> 21:47.021
You listen here.

21:47.073 --> 21:48.739
I'm only gonna say this once.

21:49.192 --> 21:51.831
I had my chance with
Simcoe before, all right?

21:51.883 --> 21:54.078
But the bastard slipped
through my fingers.

21:54.113 --> 21:55.946
That won't be happening again.

22:13.182 --> 22:15.342
Still not used to all
the quiet in the house.

22:16.519 --> 22:18.527
It's so strange not having Thomas here.

22:20.189 --> 22:22.356
I hope Abraham is all right
with him alone on the farm.

22:23.119 --> 22:26.477
Perhaps Abraham should have considered
that before he betrayed us all.

22:26.529 --> 22:29.396
- He'll do fine.
- How do you know that?

22:29.448 --> 22:31.367
Because I raised him on my own.

22:32.151 --> 22:34.235
Abe and his brother
after my wife passed.

22:34.237 --> 22:35.870
Look how well that turned out.

22:37.262 --> 22:40.624
I've heard rumblings there's a
room available at Strong Manor.

22:40.660 --> 22:43.577
When exactly will you be depriving
us all of your presence?

22:43.629 --> 22:44.873
Richard, please.

22:45.715 --> 22:47.882
I'll be damned if I let this harlot

22:47.917 --> 22:50.000
speak to me in that
manner in my own house.

22:50.052 --> 22:52.219
You will address her with respect, sir.

22:52.255 --> 22:54.138
<i>And if you cannot manage to do that,</i>

22:54.173 --> 22:55.839
<i>then that will be our friendship ended.</i>

22:55.892 --> 22:56.974
Why are you defending her?

22:57.009 --> 23:00.094
Because, sir, she is to be my wife.

23:00.096 --> 23:03.097
(laughs)

23:07.737 --> 23:09.937
- Is this true?
- Anna: Yes, it is.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.906
We're to be married as soon as possible.

23:14.443 --> 23:17.611
Congratulations. I hope that you
two will find happiness together.

23:17.613 --> 23:21.282
Thank you, Mary. She makes me
more happy than you can imagine.

23:24.203 --> 23:27.454
So you've gone hand in hand
with the enemy once again.

23:29.410 --> 23:31.530
- What are you talking about? - Abraham.

23:31.794 --> 23:34.295
You've made some sort of
pact with him, haven't you?

23:34.891 --> 23:37.799
- What?
- I give up my own son as a traitor

23:37.850 --> 23:40.851
to stop my grandson
following in his footsteps,

23:40.886 --> 23:43.828
only now the boy is back with
his father who walks free.

23:43.863 --> 23:44.822
Why?

23:45.524 --> 23:47.775
Because he's gifted you this woman?

23:47.810 --> 23:49.810
- <i> (chair scrapes)</i>
- That is enough, Richard.

23:49.862 --> 23:51.612
This has nothing to do with Abraham.

23:51.647 --> 23:54.190
<i>You've only got yourself
to blame on that account.</i>

23:54.242 --> 23:57.568
If you'd have told me what you knew sooner,
then none of this would have happened.

23:58.738 --> 24:00.571
(utensils clatter)

24:01.624 --> 24:03.374
Excuse me.

24:06.495 --> 24:08.996
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- (exhales)

24:13.469 --> 24:14.649
We're not leaving.

24:14.651 --> 24:17.304
- <i> (door slams)</i>
- What?

24:17.340 --> 24:20.140
We'll stay here in Setauket

24:20.176 --> 24:21.392
and be married here.

24:21.427 --> 24:23.427
Edmund, please.

24:23.479 --> 24:26.013
I don't care what Richard
or anyone else says.

24:26.065 --> 24:29.350
I love you for who you are

24:29.402 --> 24:31.101
and for all that you are.

24:31.153 --> 24:33.070
And I want the world to know it.

24:33.105 --> 24:35.939
No. No, you can't stay.

24:35.992 --> 24:37.274
We can't stay.

24:37.326 --> 24:38.659
What, because of your reputation?

24:38.694 --> 24:41.779
Because... because of the danger.

24:41.831 --> 24:43.197
B-because of Simcoe.

24:43.249 --> 24:44.698
Yes, and that is being taken care of.

24:44.750 --> 24:47.868
- You don't know that.
- I am done running, Anna.

24:47.870 --> 24:51.672
If not for you, I would have fled as
soon as I came back from Connecticut.

24:51.707 --> 24:53.507
But you gave me the strength to stay on.

24:53.542 --> 24:57.544
It would be wrong of me to now
encourage you to flee from your home,

24:57.546 --> 25:02.016
especially when I'm capable
of keeping you safe here.

25:02.051 --> 25:04.913
<i>Now, write your husband</i>

25:05.271 --> 25:07.888
and tell him that you agree
to his terms of divorce

25:07.890 --> 25:09.940
and then we'll be married immediately.

25:11.138 --> 25:14.897
Though we will surely have to
find another magistrate to do it.

25:25.207 --> 25:28.409
- (horse snorts)
- <i> (owl hooting)</i>

25:44.343 --> 25:46.844
(whimpering)

25:58.824 --> 26:01.775
<i>(bird calling)</i>

26:06.999 --> 26:10.784
<i>(bird calling)</i>

26:31.307 --> 26:32.773
(clicks)

26:34.977 --> 26:38.312
(horse whickers)

26:40.649 --> 26:42.699
<i>(horses approach)</i>

26:48.657 --> 26:51.241
(whispers) Wait till they
get to the front door.

26:53.329 --> 26:54.995
<i>(metal rattling)</i>

26:56.863 --> 26:58.632
- Rangers out back.
- What?

26:58.667 --> 27:02.169
- Sons of whores.
- No, no, no, no. Wait, wait, wait.

27:03.172 --> 27:05.172
(gunshot)

27:06.175 --> 27:09.843
<i>(horses whinnying)</i>

27:12.064 --> 27:15.015
(groaning)

27:16.152 --> 27:17.484
(groans)

27:19.822 --> 27:20.938
(cocks rifle)

27:20.990 --> 27:22.689
(groans)

27:24.026 --> 27:26.326
Back to the shore!

27:35.371 --> 27:37.037
(groans)

27:48.717 --> 27:51.718
All right, next volley,
fire and then we run.

27:51.770 --> 27:53.887
On the way back to the
beach, you, then me.

27:53.889 --> 27:55.222
You ready?

27:55.224 --> 27:56.473
(clicks)

27:56.525 --> 27:58.392
<i>(gunshot)</i>

28:03.732 --> 28:06.783
- Run, you bastard.
- Run!

28:06.819 --> 28:08.535
Don't let him get to the shore!

28:08.571 --> 28:10.404
<i>(gunshot)</i>

28:11.407 --> 28:13.540
Take cover! Look to the rear.

28:32.761 --> 28:34.177
Psst.

28:36.982 --> 28:38.649
<i>(Simcoe whispering)
Flank him, carefully.</i>

28:38.684 --> 28:39.983
(rifle cocks)

28:53.356 --> 28:56.007
- <i> (music playing)</i>
- Neddy endured deplorable conditions

28:56.059 --> 28:58.927
during his captivity and
braved them with distinction.

28:59.958 --> 29:01.753
Betsy: <i>Do you think
he's here to propose?</i>

29:01.788 --> 29:04.539
Oh, Neddy marches to the
beat of his own drummer.

29:04.591 --> 29:06.269
We shouldn't hasten the tempo.

29:06.760 --> 29:09.177
There's no reason why you
shouldn't be married immediately.

29:09.212 --> 29:12.597
Long engagements are for milksops
who can't finish the job.

29:12.632 --> 29:14.399
But, sir, I haven't even proposed.

29:15.677 --> 29:17.469
I would ask for Betsy's hand, Uncle,

29:17.494 --> 29:21.606
<i>but I fear I don't have the means to
support her on a soldier's wages.</i>

29:21.641 --> 29:23.691
If it's money that you're
worried about, then don't.

29:23.727 --> 29:25.810
I've arranged for you
to begin a law clerkship.

29:25.862 --> 29:28.062
Is this another favor
to be accounted for?

29:28.114 --> 29:29.474
An appointment.

29:29.783 --> 29:32.298
One granted by Judge Shippen himself.

29:32.986 --> 29:35.153
After Neddy's valor on
and off the battlefield,

29:35.205 --> 29:37.455
it's the very least that we can
do to honor his sacrifice.

29:37.491 --> 29:40.242
Yes, I'm in need of a prothonotary.

29:40.882 --> 29:42.794
The Pennsylvania Supreme Court

29:42.829 --> 29:45.413
would do well to have
a man of your acumen, Neddy.

29:45.415 --> 29:47.799
This young man survived
a British prison ship

29:47.834 --> 29:49.250
and Haller's battalion.

29:49.252 --> 29:51.150
I'm quite certain he can handle a desk.

29:52.135 --> 29:54.839
Perhaps you should stop seeing
demons where there are none.

29:55.339 --> 29:56.758
Perhaps you're right.

29:56.760 --> 29:58.760
Esther: <i>So, you two can agree.</i>

29:58.762 --> 30:01.120
The impossible is possible.

30:03.099 --> 30:05.934
Joseph, would you show me that
lovely painting in the foyer?

30:05.936 --> 30:08.102
I want to see all its beauty up close.

30:08.104 --> 30:09.854
Of course. If you'll excuse us.

30:09.906 --> 30:11.031
General.

30:13.693 --> 30:16.087
I've always fancied a Christmas wedding.

30:16.663 --> 30:19.280
You expect Grandfather to
travel through ice and snow?

30:20.917 --> 30:23.835
Spring is a grand time for a wedding.

30:23.870 --> 30:25.367
Perhaps even summer.

30:25.755 --> 30:28.339
The city will be flush and in bloom

30:28.375 --> 30:30.291
and you'll be even more radiant.

30:32.295 --> 30:34.039
I'm not you, Peggy.

30:34.798 --> 30:37.348
I'm not the most beautiful
girl in the colonies

30:37.384 --> 30:38.933
or Father's favorite.

30:38.969 --> 30:41.970
Why delay my only chance at happiness?

30:44.941 --> 30:46.495
(clinks)

30:47.310 --> 30:49.477
(clears throat)

30:51.197 --> 30:53.063
I would like to thank
you all for being here

30:53.400 --> 30:57.485
to celebrate the good fortune that
has graced many of us in this room.

30:58.087 --> 31:00.831
After trials and adversities,

31:01.598 --> 31:03.875
<i>we all have much to be grateful for.</i>

31:04.215 --> 31:05.359
A toast.

31:07.047 --> 31:09.047
To young love renewed

31:09.332 --> 31:11.549
and to honor restored.

31:11.585 --> 31:12.502
Hear, hear.

31:18.508 --> 31:20.892
Now, I believe that
Major Burd has something

31:20.927 --> 31:23.761
that he would like to... Neddy?

31:25.732 --> 31:27.348
<i>(door opens)</i>

31:27.350 --> 31:29.350
A message for you from camp, sir.

31:30.319 --> 31:31.319
I'll see to it after dinner.

31:31.354 --> 31:33.488
<i>It came with a note from
General Washington, sir.</i>

31:33.523 --> 31:35.490
<i>He expressed that you were
to read it immediately.</i>

31:35.525 --> 31:36.799
Betsy...

31:37.661 --> 31:39.527
Elizabeth.

31:39.579 --> 31:42.530
<i>It seems as if I have
known you my entire life,</i>

31:43.192 --> 31:45.366
<i>which I have, of course.</i>

31:45.418 --> 31:48.012
<i>And I have always loved you</i>

31:48.064 --> 31:49.734
as more than a cousin.

31:55.261 --> 31:56.761
Excuse me.

31:56.796 --> 31:58.880
- Sir, if I may...
- Not now, Franks.

31:58.882 --> 32:00.348
Benedict.

32:00.383 --> 32:01.716
Benedict, what's wrong?

32:01.768 --> 32:03.518
Congress has rejected Paca's decision

32:03.553 --> 32:05.687
and referred the charges against
me back to a court-martial.

32:05.722 --> 32:08.189
- But I thought you said...
- Reed. It was Reed.

32:08.224 --> 32:10.024
He threatened to split
Pennsylvania from the body

32:10.060 --> 32:12.060
and they gave in to him.

32:12.062 --> 32:14.195
I'm right back to where I started.

32:33.416 --> 32:35.633
Hello, Quarles. How are you?

32:35.669 --> 32:38.219
- Major Rogers?
- Drop it.

32:39.673 --> 32:40.755
Hello, boys.

32:40.807 --> 32:43.975
Well, this is...

32:45.595 --> 32:46.811
unexpected.

32:46.846 --> 32:50.064
(laughs) I suppose you
must be used to that.

32:50.100 --> 32:52.600
I could have crept up
on you in broad daylight.

32:52.602 --> 32:55.903
The famed Robert Rogers.

32:55.939 --> 32:57.855
I've longed to meet you in person, sir.

32:57.907 --> 33:00.658
<i>Oh, well, you'll just have to
keep on longing, won't you?</i>

33:00.694 --> 33:03.444
Because I'm going to make
haste with Quarles here.

33:03.496 --> 33:07.365
And I suppose we'll have tea and scones
sometime at Westminster, shall we?

33:07.417 --> 33:09.333
Drop it. Drop it, Brandon.

33:09.369 --> 33:12.754
I'm afraid they don't take
orders from you anymore, Major.

33:12.789 --> 33:14.372
We'll see about that.

33:14.424 --> 33:18.459
You take one more step to me, I
will cut his throat wide open.

33:18.511 --> 33:20.461
Go ahead.

33:20.463 --> 33:22.180
Rogers: <i>You hear that, boys?</i>

33:22.215 --> 33:25.933
That ghost would have you dead.

33:25.969 --> 33:28.136
<i>You think I'd have done that to you?</i>

33:28.188 --> 33:30.938
I would die for you boys.

33:30.974 --> 33:32.857
You know that.

33:32.892 --> 33:34.942
I would die for you!

33:34.978 --> 33:36.811
Put your guns down!

33:39.315 --> 33:40.484
That's all right.

33:41.568 --> 33:44.956
We can settle this in the old fashion.

33:46.906 --> 33:48.980
Weapons down, gentlemen.

33:51.661 --> 33:53.995
Weapons down!

33:55.248 --> 33:57.893
If Major Rogers manages to kill me,

33:57.895 --> 34:00.136
<i>I order you to let him leave unharmed.</i>

34:01.163 --> 34:04.639
Or follow him if you so choose.

34:07.060 --> 34:08.426
Get out of here.

34:10.647 --> 34:14.815
I am going to carve you up, ginger.

34:18.605 --> 34:20.521
Come on. Come on, boy.

34:20.572 --> 34:22.190
Yeah?

34:25.578 --> 34:29.496
You're old, fat, and slow.

34:29.532 --> 34:30.947
You're the past.

34:31.000 --> 34:33.000
(shouts)

34:35.255 --> 34:37.371
(grunting)

34:37.373 --> 34:39.290
And I'm the future.

34:39.342 --> 34:42.510
- (shouts)
- (screams)

34:46.132 --> 34:49.516
The only thing I can't work out

34:49.552 --> 34:52.937
is why you decided
to return to Long Island,

34:52.972 --> 34:57.725
especially after the king
signed a warrant for...

35:01.531 --> 35:03.314
you're Culper.

35:05.735 --> 35:07.485
Oh, that's brilliant.

35:07.537 --> 35:10.621
You hid your treachery in plain sight.

35:10.657 --> 35:12.957
A mercenary through and through.

35:12.992 --> 35:16.711
Playing both sides against one another.

35:18.298 --> 35:19.831
A true American.

35:23.920 --> 35:27.088
Are you looking for this?

35:28.258 --> 35:30.057
(laughs)

35:30.093 --> 35:33.761
It's a shame, really,
when... when the mind goes.

35:33.813 --> 35:35.930
Pistol, please.

35:47.327 --> 35:50.111
(grunting)

35:55.285 --> 35:57.001
Find him!

35:57.036 --> 36:00.421
He's got one eye! Find him!

36:04.093 --> 36:06.544
(whickers)

36:10.133 --> 36:12.306
(coughs)

36:17.273 --> 36:20.107
<i>(birds calling)</i>

36:20.143 --> 36:22.610
Ah, he wakes.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.282
Hungry?

36:30.453 --> 36:31.816
Where are we?

36:32.288 --> 36:33.988
You're on your way to meet Major André.

36:34.531 --> 36:36.374
<i>That's the least you could do for me</i>

36:36.691 --> 36:38.743
seeing that you fouled my mission.

36:38.795 --> 36:40.411
I won't talk.

36:40.852 --> 36:42.663
You might as well kill me now.

36:44.167 --> 36:45.826
Oh, I'd love to.

36:46.469 --> 36:48.330
Give you a second smile

36:48.671 --> 36:51.138
like I did for your old man Sackett.

36:51.474 --> 36:53.257
<i>But I got chastised, you see.</i>

36:53.643 --> 36:55.923
Won't make the same mistake twice.

36:57.227 --> 36:59.230
Though after the major
gets done with you,

36:59.571 --> 37:02.767
<i>I expect he'll have me see you vanished.</i>

37:03.622 --> 37:05.955
After all, you're not in uniform,

37:07.449 --> 37:09.258
so the rules are off the table.

37:20.253 --> 37:22.837
(horse whinnies)

37:22.872 --> 37:24.038
(gunshot)

37:24.040 --> 37:25.957
(horse whinnies)

37:40.949 --> 37:42.950
Are you sure there's nothing we can do?

37:42.952 --> 37:44.451
No, dear, I'll look after him

37:44.453 --> 37:45.786
and make sure he has all he needs.

37:45.788 --> 37:47.872
You're not intending to stay here?

37:47.924 --> 37:51.091
I understand your concern, but
there's propriety to be considered.

37:51.127 --> 37:54.461
It would be improper not to
support my future husband.

37:54.463 --> 37:56.630
He just received word
that his sister is unwell.

37:56.632 --> 37:58.265
Imagine his distress, Father.

37:59.552 --> 38:01.886
I'll send the carriage
back for you in an hour.

38:01.938 --> 38:03.141
My dear.

38:04.607 --> 38:06.737
Please give the general our best wishes.

38:06.762 --> 38:07.807
<i>(door opens)</i>

38:07.996 --> 38:10.644
Yes, and be sure to thank him
for a grand evening.

38:10.696 --> 38:12.613
As much as we've been in conflict,

38:12.648 --> 38:15.962
I'm glad that he has found
the justice he deserves.

38:21.157 --> 38:23.541
<i>- (Arnold grunts)
- (loud crash)</i>

38:28.714 --> 38:30.164
(grunts)

38:30.216 --> 38:32.666
<i>(panting)</i>

38:32.718 --> 38:35.553
"Making degrading requests
of a militiaman."

38:35.588 --> 38:37.555
Oh, please, I asked him for a barber.

38:37.590 --> 38:39.328
This is a farce.

38:39.809 --> 38:41.728
Reed has always sought to ruin me,

38:41.763 --> 38:44.251
<i>ever since he was a
sniveling clerk in Congress</i>

38:44.303 --> 38:47.490
hiding behind my protection
while stabbing me in the back.

38:47.515 --> 38:50.067
I should know to expect
nothing from them.

38:51.187 --> 38:53.404
But I counted on better from Washington.

38:54.857 --> 38:56.895
"In a future letter

38:57.474 --> 39:00.027
I shall communicate my reasons."

39:00.029 --> 39:02.010
<i>(paper crumples, thuds)</i>

39:02.745 --> 39:04.708
Don't I deserve an explanation now?

39:05.538 --> 39:08.410
Don't I deserve the loyalty
that I have always given him?

39:08.977 --> 39:11.372
He wouldn't even have an army to
command if it weren't for me,

39:11.374 --> 39:13.207
and yet he deprives me of command.

39:13.259 --> 39:14.625
He deprives me of glory.

39:14.677 --> 39:17.041
And now he deprives me of my honor.

39:19.271 --> 39:21.198
If they want to make an enemy of me,

39:22.077 --> 39:23.549
then I will make them mine.

39:25.021 --> 39:26.971
If only they knew what I
could do to them, Peggy.

39:27.023 --> 39:29.236
I could destroy them if I wanted to.

39:30.948 --> 39:32.133
Destroy them.

39:36.981 --> 39:38.654
Then perhaps you should.

39:43.458 --> 39:45.326
When the city was occupied,

39:46.375 --> 39:48.375
I became acquainted with a royal officer

39:48.411 --> 39:50.411
by the name of John André.

39:50.413 --> 39:52.579
He wanted to end this war.

39:52.581 --> 39:55.082
Said England should make
peace with the colonies.

39:55.396 --> 39:57.524
When the army left for New York, he said

39:58.620 --> 40:01.421
if I came across any Patriots
who thought likewise,

40:01.424 --> 40:03.757
<i>I should write to him and let him know.</i>

40:03.759 --> 40:06.010
I listened politely,

40:06.062 --> 40:08.929
but never expected
to take him up on his offer.

40:10.099 --> 40:11.725
Until now.

40:16.105 --> 40:21.108
Now that I see
I can help the man I love.

40:24.101 --> 40:25.913
I just thought you should know...

40:27.925 --> 40:30.034
I have a way to reach out.

40:34.405 --> 40:37.291
If your friends won't
appreciate you, Benedict...

40:39.782 --> 40:42.096
then perhaps his will.
