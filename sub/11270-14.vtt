00:07.440 --> 00:09.895
- Hello, everyone.
- Hi, Diane.

00:10.025 --> 00:13.439
I am in a wonderful mood today.

00:13.568 --> 00:17.731
I spent the weekend
at an lndian film festival.

00:17.863 --> 00:19.606
It left me euphoric.

00:20.781 --> 00:24.066
I love lndian films.
Remember <i>Fort Apache?</i>

00:24.200 --> 00:27.864
Just thinking about it makes the hair
on my arms go up. Look!

00:27.994 --> 00:31.990
No, Coach, we're not
talking about American Indians.

00:32.121 --> 00:37.196
I can make the hair on my arms
stand up any time I want. See?

00:40.084 --> 00:41.033
Carla!

00:41.168 --> 00:44.868
Think that's something?
Cathy Settudicato, from St Clete's,

00:45.004 --> 00:48.454
belched the whole 23rd Psalm
at the talent show once.

00:49.382 --> 00:53.460
That's good, but I knew this guy,
Randy Evans, first baseman,

00:53.593 --> 00:56.925
he could make his eyeballs vibrate.
I always wanted to.

00:57.053 --> 01:02.128
- Randy Evans? Who'd he play for?
- Mostly the Cleveland lndians.

01:02.264 --> 01:06.592
Speaking of Indians, remember
<i>Fort Apache?</i> Just thinking of it...

01:08.393 --> 01:10.184
Go, bumps!

02:34.194 --> 02:37.644
- Hi, Sam.
- How are you, Marshall?

02:37.780 --> 02:40.400
- How's everything at school?
- Fine.

02:42.116 --> 02:45.530
- Could I have a beer, please?
- Of course, Marshall.

02:45.659 --> 02:48.944
Marshall, good to see you, sexy.

02:50.871 --> 02:53.539
- Hi, Carla.
- So, how you doing?

02:53.664 --> 02:57.197
My uric acid is up
to seven-point-five.

02:57.333 --> 03:00.001
That explains
that twinkle in your eye.

03:01.085 --> 03:04.369
Diane, this is Marshall.
Marshall, Diane.

03:04.504 --> 03:07.420
- Hi, Marshall.
- You'll love this kid, Diane.

03:07.547 --> 03:09.539
Very smart. Teaches at a college.

03:10.174 --> 03:13.588
- MlT.
- See? He can spell good, too.

03:14.426 --> 03:17.876
Marshall teaches a subject
I know nothing about.

03:18.012 --> 03:20.549
Could you narrow that down a bit?

03:21.639 --> 03:23.678
- I'm in cybernetics.
- Right!

03:23.807 --> 03:28.099
The more we learn about cybers,
the better we can control 'em.

03:29.852 --> 03:31.844
Why did you get into computers?

03:31.979 --> 03:36.804
I enjoy integrating formerly
unassociated supporting elements

03:36.940 --> 03:39.181
to maximise a probability ratio

03:39.316 --> 03:41.604
by interweaving the input data.

03:41.734 --> 03:44.403
Watch it, Marshall, I'm heatin' up!

03:47.154 --> 03:50.237
Marshall can make his computer
do incredible things.

03:50.365 --> 03:54.361
Write poetry, play games, make
predictions on elections, sports.

03:54.492 --> 03:56.697
Sounds like fun.

03:57.577 --> 04:01.276
You got any hot tips for us,
Marshall?

04:01.413 --> 04:03.737
The Celtics will lose today.

04:03.873 --> 04:06.410
Watch your tongue, Marshall.

04:06.541 --> 04:09.410
No, let me show you.
Take a look at this.

04:14.963 --> 04:17.334
Can't argue with that, Sam.

04:19.464 --> 04:25.252
You see, this shows correlation
between the Celtics' win-loss record

04:25.385 --> 04:30.888
and the relative activity
of the Van Allen radiation belt.

04:31.014 --> 04:34.844
Isn't that the one
that Buster Crabbe wears on TV?

04:34.974 --> 04:36.847
I know it sounds a little crazy,

04:36.976 --> 04:39.014
but just by coincidence,

04:39.144 --> 04:44.349
I noticed that the days
the belt is in a state of flux,

04:44.480 --> 04:46.768
the Celtics are always beaten.

04:46.898 --> 04:50.894
Are you sure? Your computer
wouldn't be pulling your leg?

04:51.568 --> 04:54.567
No, my computer never kids, Sam.

04:54.695 --> 04:59.319
He appreciates a good joke,
but he never tells one.

05:00.948 --> 05:03.569
- Mind if I borrow this for a while?
- Sure.

05:03.700 --> 05:06.237
- Thanks.
- I have to go now.

05:09.704 --> 05:11.742
- So long.
- Bye. See you, Carla.

05:13.456 --> 05:15.697
Don't break too many hearts,
Marshall.

05:19.001 --> 05:23.827
I get around you, and my testosterone
goes up 78 percent.

05:27.839 --> 05:29.961
Do you really find me attractive?

05:30.758 --> 05:32.999
I love a stylish guy.

05:33.760 --> 05:36.131
You've got the new wet look.

05:36.886 --> 05:39.258
Your hair, your palms...

05:43.015 --> 05:44.473
Coach?

05:45.225 --> 05:48.427
When was the last time
you had a sure thing?

05:48.560 --> 05:52.603
- Rosie McGonagle.
- No, Coach.

05:52.729 --> 05:56.227
I'm talking about
betting against the Celtics.

05:56.356 --> 05:58.147
Sam, you can't do that!

05:58.274 --> 06:00.313
Come on, Marshall's never wrong.

06:00.442 --> 06:05.102
We've never bet against
a Boston team. We've never done that.

06:05.237 --> 06:06.979
I know.

06:10.698 --> 06:14.564
Think hard about this.
All our customers'll turn against us.

06:14.701 --> 06:16.609
I know, they'd never forgive us.

06:16.743 --> 06:19.494
They'd hate us
for the rest of our lives.

06:24.206 --> 06:27.408
Of course, we're not gonna
live forever, are we?

06:28.292 --> 06:30.118
I'll get it down.

06:30.252 --> 06:34.544
We can't let any of the boys know
about this. It's gotta be quiet.

06:34.671 --> 06:37.540
I can't even remember
what we were talking about.

06:37.673 --> 06:42.000
Sam, we were talking about
betting against the Celtics!

06:43.301 --> 06:45.542
Yeah, thanks. Thanks.

06:45.677 --> 06:47.634
I worry about him.

06:48.721 --> 06:51.389
- Afternoon, everybody.
- Norm!

06:51.723 --> 06:54.509
- Norman.
- What's doing, Norm?

06:54.641 --> 06:57.843
Well, science is seeking
a cure for thirst.

06:57.976 --> 06:59.933
I happen to be the guinea pig.

07:01.895 --> 07:04.848
- Oh, boy.
- Rough day?

07:04.981 --> 07:08.395
Yeah. Vera read a woman's magazine
over the weekend

07:08.524 --> 07:11.145
about putting romance
back in your marriage.

07:11.276 --> 07:12.686
You're in trouble.

07:12.819 --> 07:15.569
She says I gotta act
like we're courting.

07:15.695 --> 07:20.486
I got to call her up for a date, buy
flowers, take her someplace fancy.

07:20.615 --> 07:23.069
- Sounds good.
- I'm a romantic guy.

07:23.200 --> 07:26.402
I go to the corner,
use the payphone, call her up,

07:26.535 --> 07:29.784
she turns me down. Who needs it?

07:30.829 --> 07:31.943
Game time, Sammy.

07:32.080 --> 07:35.530
Turn on the set, pour me a beer
and let's start dribbling.

07:36.416 --> 07:38.906
How you doin', Coach?

07:41.127 --> 07:45.787
Cheers. Diane's busy at the moment.
Can I say who's calling?

07:45.922 --> 07:49.752
Her mother?
A pleasure to meet you, Mrs Chambers.

07:49.882 --> 07:52.040
I'm Sam Malone.

07:52.801 --> 07:54.958
Yeah? She mentioned me?

07:55.636 --> 07:58.920
No, I'm not scratching myself
at the moment.

08:01.222 --> 08:04.222
Yeah, hold on a second,
I'll get her for you.

08:04.474 --> 08:07.047
Diane, it's your mother.

08:10.019 --> 08:12.688
Take it from me, you're not adopted.

08:14.605 --> 08:16.846
Thank you. Mommy?

08:18.983 --> 08:20.607
What?

08:23.611 --> 08:24.773
Oh, no!

08:28.822 --> 08:30.648
No.

08:30.782 --> 08:32.240
I'll be alright.

08:33.033 --> 08:34.989
I'll call you back later, OK?

08:41.913 --> 08:45.411
- Elizabeth is dead.
- Gee, Diane, that's awful.

08:46.082 --> 08:48.121
A member of your family?

08:49.001 --> 08:53.495
Elizabeth Barrett Browning.
She was our family cat.

08:55.004 --> 08:58.004
Cat? You scared us, Diane.

08:58.131 --> 09:00.965
You should've said that
right off the bat.

09:02.759 --> 09:05.842
Diane, did you spend
a lot of time with the cat?

09:07.971 --> 09:12.927
Well, since I left home,
I've only seen her in the holidays.

09:14.224 --> 09:15.682
Too bad.

09:17.226 --> 09:19.597
Alright, we got tip-off time here.

09:21.312 --> 09:22.971
Not bad.

09:25.022 --> 09:27.180
What a bad bat!

09:27.899 --> 09:30.934
Diane, could I have another beer?

09:31.735 --> 09:33.442
Diane, you working or what?

09:44.742 --> 09:48.988
I am sorry to interrupt, but I have
something important to say.

09:50.287 --> 09:51.615
Since I have been here,

09:51.747 --> 09:54.830
I have struggled
to make certain changes in myself

09:54.957 --> 09:57.198
in order
to fit in to the general milieu.

09:57.333 --> 10:00.831
- And you're doing a good job...
- It has not been easy.

10:02.586 --> 10:05.372
However, I am proud to say
that, for example,

10:05.505 --> 10:09.204
I no longer have to cover my eyes
when I watch a hockey fight.

10:11.133 --> 10:14.216
In one case, I even took sides.

10:16.470 --> 10:20.051
But now, in my moment of crisis,

10:20.180 --> 10:22.966
it is glaringly apparent
that no one here

10:23.099 --> 10:27.558
has made any effort
to understand my sensibilities.

10:32.604 --> 10:34.845
No, this is me.

10:42.819 --> 10:44.016
Diane?

10:46.988 --> 10:51.529
Something my father used to say
when we had a death in the family.

10:52.825 --> 10:55.694
Maybe it'll help. He'd say,

10:56.368 --> 10:58.195
"Sprinkle the ashes,

10:58.328 --> 11:01.114
all the tangible remains
of our dear one."

11:01.997 --> 11:04.866
"But thank God for the intangibles."

11:05.749 --> 11:08.417
"The impact of his life on ours."

11:09.918 --> 11:13.202
"We remember the smile,

11:13.879 --> 11:17.211
the frown, the quizzical look,

11:18.048 --> 11:19.874
the love, the courage..."

11:20.008 --> 11:21.501
Commercials are over.

11:21.634 --> 11:25.843
Fun times, hurt, moments
of searching, risk, affirmation,

11:25.969 --> 11:29.669
and a whole bunch of other stuff.
Come on, Celtics, go!

11:42.021 --> 11:46.894
- Did the Celtics start without me?
- Yeah. Losing without him, too.

11:47.024 --> 11:49.692
- How we doin'?
- Down nine, a minute and change.

11:49.817 --> 11:52.568
- We can still win, right, Coachie?
- Sure, Norm.

11:52.694 --> 11:55.314
I wish I had some money
on the Celtics.

11:55.445 --> 11:58.445
Don't you wish you had money
on the Celtics, Sam?

11:59.323 --> 12:03.105
- Go wait on somebody.
- Good idea. I'll wait on somebody.

12:06.410 --> 12:10.489
Miss? I'm all by myself.
I only ordered one beer.

12:12.872 --> 12:15.113
Didn't I see you with other people?

12:15.249 --> 12:18.948
I was here last night with people,
but they're not with me tonight.

12:19.084 --> 12:21.705
I see. They're all gone.

12:22.878 --> 12:28.084
Everything in life comes and goes.
The things that matter most to us

12:28.215 --> 12:31.084
are taken away
when we can't afford to lose them.

12:31.217 --> 12:35.083
In the end, everything we strive for
comes to nothing.

12:36.928 --> 12:39.714
- I'll take away the extra beers.
- No.

12:39.847 --> 12:42.419
Suddenly, I'm in the mood
for all of 'em.

12:47.476 --> 12:49.764
Vampira, get to work, here.

12:51.020 --> 12:56.143
Carla, could we talk for a minute?
I really need to talk to somebody.

12:57.274 --> 13:02.148
Carla, please? Have you ever lost
a pet? Have you ever had a pet?

13:02.902 --> 13:07.443
Are you kidding? I've been through it
a thousand times with the kids.

13:07.572 --> 13:10.939
Goldfish, parakeets, turtles...

13:11.074 --> 13:14.073
No. A cat is different.

13:14.659 --> 13:17.030
Yeah, you can't flush a cat.

13:26.458 --> 13:30.584
I know you're not going to
believe this, but I do admire you.

13:30.710 --> 13:32.667
I believe it.

13:32.795 --> 13:36.791
You are so tough. You keep
your head up, no matter what.

13:38.548 --> 13:40.587
How do you do that?

13:40.716 --> 13:43.965
I'll tell you.
I always look on the bright side.

13:44.093 --> 13:46.216
No matter how lousy a situation is,

13:46.345 --> 13:49.179
I can always find something in it
to make me happy.

13:49.805 --> 13:53.303
What good could you possibly say
about a loved one dying?

13:54.600 --> 13:56.141
It ain't me.

14:01.270 --> 14:04.353
Extra points. We've still got time.

14:04.481 --> 14:06.722
- Terrific.
- Yeah, terrific.

14:06.857 --> 14:09.857
Swish! Larry Bird got another one!

14:11.568 --> 14:14.236
- Another one, already?
- Another one, already?

14:14.361 --> 14:17.895
- They're only down by three.
- Shoot the inbound pass!

14:18.030 --> 14:19.987
Three seconds, shoot it!

14:22.366 --> 14:24.074
Damn, he missed!

14:24.201 --> 14:27.070
- We lost!
- Alright!

14:30.037 --> 14:35.374
Pitcher's elbow. I lose control of it
during intense moments of sorrow.

14:36.166 --> 14:39.949
Coach, I think if I went out
and got a breath of fresh air,

14:40.085 --> 14:42.622
it might fight back these tears.
Wanna join me?

14:42.753 --> 14:45.125
- No, I feel terrific.
- Join me!

14:45.255 --> 14:47.709
Yeah, I do feel a cry coming on.

14:56.637 --> 14:59.636
Yeah. Boy, they're really
taking it hard.

15:07.977 --> 15:11.676
- Did you ever lose a pet?
- Like an animal?

15:13.689 --> 15:14.554
Yeah.

15:14.689 --> 15:18.768
I never had a pet. My grandfather
had a dog that I loved very much.

15:20.276 --> 15:23.229
- What did you call him?
- Grandpa.

15:26.530 --> 15:29.020
- I meant the dog.
- The dog? Bruno.

15:30.490 --> 15:34.107
- What happened to him?
- Fell down in the bathtub and died.

15:37.786 --> 15:40.656
- I meant the dog.
- So did I.

15:41.455 --> 15:44.870
My grandfather, poor old guy,
got run over by a bus.

15:49.251 --> 15:53.294
You know something? Nobody's ever
listened to my story before.

15:53.421 --> 15:56.753
It's good to get it off your chest.

15:56.881 --> 16:02.039
If ever I can be there for you,
just let me know and I'll be there.

16:02.176 --> 16:03.918
- Actually...
- Excuse me.

16:13.224 --> 16:14.848
Jack Daniel's.

16:14.975 --> 16:18.058
Miss, I ordered this on the rocks.

16:20.728 --> 16:22.139
No!

16:23.438 --> 16:28.015
It's not that bad, really.
Sweetheart, it's no problem.

16:29.692 --> 16:33.558
I'm sorry. I like it this way. Look!

16:34.904 --> 16:36.942
Good, good!

16:38.239 --> 16:40.480
Darling? Miss?

16:40.615 --> 16:42.572
Here's a tip for you.

16:45.368 --> 16:47.988
Five bucks for a couple of tears?

17:02.837 --> 17:06.335
I can't believe you're that upset
over an animal dying.

17:07.214 --> 17:10.001
You obviously have never had a pet.

17:10.133 --> 17:12.172
I have, too.

17:13.260 --> 17:15.714
- What?
- I had a dog.

17:16.387 --> 17:19.589
Cutest little guy!
Floppy ears, big eyes.

17:19.722 --> 17:22.176
I took him for a walk every morning.

17:22.848 --> 17:24.722
Great way to meet women.

17:27.852 --> 17:31.385
So you loved this dog because
you could use him as a come-on?

17:31.521 --> 17:34.604
- No!
- I bet you can't remember his name.

17:34.731 --> 17:36.972
Sure I do! It was Fluffy.

17:37.649 --> 17:39.273
Or Buffy.

17:40.359 --> 17:43.644
Or was that one of the girls
he helped me to meet?

17:43.778 --> 17:46.315
Come on! What is it you want?

17:46.446 --> 17:48.521
I wanted a little sympathy.

17:50.157 --> 17:51.816
Why didn't you say so?

17:51.950 --> 17:55.234
Sam, there are subtleties
of expression.

17:55.368 --> 17:59.281
I have been saying so all day
with the look in my eye,

17:59.412 --> 18:01.653
the knit of my brow, my posture...

18:01.789 --> 18:04.492
How come you just don't use words?

18:07.250 --> 18:09.289
No.

18:09.418 --> 18:13.082
- No, I'm gonna sympathise.
- Don't be ridiculous!

18:13.212 --> 18:16.082
- Tell me about your cat.
- I don't want to talk about it.

18:16.214 --> 18:18.253
Well, tough!

18:24.761 --> 18:27.547
Well, I was...

18:29.180 --> 18:31.338
..pretty lonely as a child.

18:31.848 --> 18:34.883
I wasn't close
to anyone in my family.

18:35.017 --> 18:37.970
My father travelled frequently,

18:38.102 --> 18:42.430
and my mother was incredibly social.

18:42.563 --> 18:48.231
So Elizabeth was
my closest friend and confidante.

18:49.567 --> 18:52.235
That cat could really keep a secret.

18:54.987 --> 18:58.070
- That's good in a cat.
- Yeah.

19:00.824 --> 19:04.108
She was the only one in my life
who was always there.

19:04.868 --> 19:07.737
When everybody was mad at me,
she liked me.

19:08.829 --> 19:13.288
When I'd hide when my parents argued,
she'd come with me.

19:13.415 --> 19:17.625
Whenever I was sick, she never
left my bed until I was well again.

19:20.210 --> 19:21.834
And then,...

19:24.880 --> 19:30.998
..when I was 12 years old,
my parents separated.

19:33.135 --> 19:36.004
It was maybe
the worst night of my life.

19:37.304 --> 19:40.672
I actually thought about
throwing myself in the lake.

19:41.848 --> 19:45.595
But then I looked down
at this cat in my lap

19:45.726 --> 19:49.971
and I thought,
"Who would take care of Elizabeth?"

19:53.147 --> 19:55.020
She saved my life that night.

19:56.274 --> 19:59.273
And I know,
it's crazy and irrational,

19:59.400 --> 20:04.559
but, Sam, I can't help thinking
that last night, when her time came,

20:04.695 --> 20:07.185
she must have wondered where I was.

20:22.748 --> 20:25.831
- Sam, you're crying.
- No, I'm not.

20:26.750 --> 20:29.454
Yes, you are. Your eyes are all red

20:29.585 --> 20:31.660
and your nose is running.

20:32.337 --> 20:35.123
I'm allergic to cat stories.

20:36.923 --> 20:38.464
I can't believe this.

20:40.675 --> 20:43.130
Sam, this is so sweet.

20:43.260 --> 20:45.417
You poor kid.

21:01.312 --> 21:02.723
Wait.

21:03.689 --> 21:05.432
What are we doing?

21:06.107 --> 21:08.099
We're sharing our grief.

21:11.944 --> 21:14.564
This doesn't feel like sharing grief.

21:15.488 --> 21:18.937
Grief's kind of a tricky thing.
Shall we get back to it?

21:19.073 --> 21:24.362
Sam, you're exploiting this situation
and it just doesn't feel right to me.

21:25.077 --> 21:26.736
What? Exploiting?

21:27.786 --> 21:30.905
We got caught up
in some wonderful emotions just now,

21:31.038 --> 21:34.951
and I would hate to see that
turned into something sexual.

21:35.083 --> 21:38.995
- What are you accusing me of?
- I'm not accusing you of anything.

21:39.127 --> 21:42.126
I would just like to know
why this is happening.

21:42.253 --> 21:45.586
What difference does it make,
why it's happening?

21:45.714 --> 21:48.963
We're helpless, swept away.
What else can we do?

21:49.091 --> 21:51.083
Sam!

21:52.384 --> 21:56.084
You have never been helpless
where women are involved.

21:56.220 --> 21:57.963
Jeez!

21:58.096 --> 22:02.555
Your problem is that the only way
you can relate to women is sexually.

22:03.641 --> 22:05.847
You wanna know what your problem is?

22:05.976 --> 22:09.758
You always have to think
about things, talk about things.

22:09.895 --> 22:12.302
"Why are we doing this?
What does it mean?"

22:12.438 --> 22:15.687
"What are we going to do?"
God, it makes me so mad!

22:18.400 --> 22:21.400
An unexamined life
is not worth living.

22:22.361 --> 22:24.353
While we're talking about problems,

22:24.487 --> 22:26.562
you want to know
what bugs me about you?

22:26.697 --> 22:29.531
- Fine.
- The way you eat pretzels.

22:29.657 --> 22:31.198
- Pretzels?
- That's right.

22:31.324 --> 22:35.237
Three bites. Not two, not one,
like the rest of us. Three!

22:35.368 --> 22:38.238
- Know what bugs me about you?
- What?

22:38.370 --> 22:42.580
The cologne you always wear
is totally without nuance!

22:44.082 --> 22:47.035
That explains
the laughter behind my back!

22:47.167 --> 22:51.578
I don't know why I talk to you. Every
conversation we have is an ordeal.

22:51.712 --> 22:55.838
So let's not have any more.
And I tell you something else.

22:55.964 --> 22:58.536
You won't catch me
coming on to you again.

22:58.674 --> 23:01.958
- You're right you won't.
- We agree on something.

23:02.093 --> 23:05.923
No, I think we agree
on one other thing.

23:06.053 --> 23:09.468
- I am getting the hell out of here.
- Two things.

23:09.597 --> 23:12.632
- Diane! Wait!
- What is it?

23:12.766 --> 23:16.050
- I'm sorry about your cat.
- Thank you.

23:17.852 --> 23:20.638
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

23:23.064 --> 23:25.304
- I'll see you tomorrow.
- Alright.
