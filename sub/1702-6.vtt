00:02.168 --> 00:05.921
Janice has a question.
Who of the six of you...

00:06.172 --> 00:09.925
...has slept with
who of the six of you?

00:11.094 --> 00:13.429
Wow, it's like a dirty math problem.

00:14.681 --> 00:17.933
I'm sorry, the answer there
would be none of us.

00:18.184 --> 00:21.770
Over the years, none of you
ever got drunk and stupid?

00:22.022 --> 00:24.606
Well, that's really
a different question.

00:25.483 --> 00:30.070
I can't believe a group of people
who spends this much time together...

00:30.321 --> 00:32.322
...has never bumped uglies.

00:33.950 --> 00:36.952
There was that one time
Monica and Rachel got together.

00:37.829 --> 00:38.871
What?

00:39.414 --> 00:41.707
Excuse me, there was no time.

00:41.916 --> 00:44.418
Okay, but let's say there was.

00:44.836 --> 00:46.378
How might that go?

00:47.964 --> 00:49.048
Okay, okay.

00:49.215 --> 00:50.799
Well, then answer me this:

00:51.051 --> 00:55.054
Have any of you ever almost?

00:58.224 --> 01:01.727
- Anybody need more coffee?
- Hey, there's a dog out there!

01:52.904 --> 01:55.447
- Ugh. That is so unfortunate.
- What?

01:55.698 --> 01:58.325
Cute Naked Guy's
starting to put on weight.

01:59.994 --> 02:01.912
I'll be back in just a minute.

02:02.205 --> 02:06.500
I'm sorry that I left lipstick marks
on the phone.

02:06.709 --> 02:08.460
You didn't leave lipstick marks
on the phone.

02:08.627 --> 02:12.214
Oh! Then it must have been you. Bye.

02:13.424 --> 02:14.842
Bye-bye.

02:15.927 --> 02:18.720
- That's why I moved out.
- Hey, while we're on that...

02:18.930 --> 02:22.516
...when are you gonna tell my sister
you don't live here anymore?

02:23.059 --> 02:24.977
On some level, she already knows.

02:25.228 --> 02:27.729
She doesn't know you sneak out
every night...

02:27.939 --> 02:29.648
...and back every morning...

02:29.858 --> 02:33.110
...and that you've been
at your grandmother's for a week.

02:33.361 --> 02:35.737
Okay, well, maybe not on those levels.

02:36.447 --> 02:37.990
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:41.119 --> 02:43.829
I'm never gonna find a roommate.
Ever.

02:44.038 --> 02:45.080
Nobody good?

02:45.248 --> 02:47.749
There was the guy with the ferrets.

02:47.917 --> 02:48.917
That's plural.

02:50.545 --> 02:53.881
The spitter. Oh! And the guy
who enjoyed my name so much...

02:54.132 --> 02:56.758
...he made a noise
every time he said it.

02:56.968 --> 02:59.678
"Nice to meet you, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

03:00.054 --> 03:03.265
"Great apartment, Chandler Bing.
Bing!"

03:03.516 --> 03:05.434
- How many more tomorrow?
- Two.

03:05.685 --> 03:07.936
This photographer
who seemed really dull...

03:08.188 --> 03:10.981
...and this actor guy
who I'm not sure about.

03:11.274 --> 03:13.692
When I answered
the phone, "Chandler Bing"...

03:13.902 --> 03:16.320
...he said, "Whoa! Short message!"

03:18.031 --> 03:19.072
Ross...

03:19.365 --> 03:21.783
Foot on the floor
or come over no more.

03:23.077 --> 03:25.871
Your dresser is missing,
but this she notices.

03:26.456 --> 03:29.708
- What?
- I have to go. Heh.

03:31.044 --> 03:33.503
Carol should be home by now, so...

03:33.796 --> 03:36.381
- How's it going with you guys?
- Better, actually.

03:36.591 --> 03:39.718
I finally figured out why we're
having so much trouble.

03:39.928 --> 03:42.471
- Oh, really?
- Yeah. You know how I have you guys?

03:42.722 --> 03:45.807
She doesn't have any close
friends that are just hers.

03:45.975 --> 03:50.145
But last week, she met this woman
at the gym, Susan something.

03:50.521 --> 03:55.067
And they really hit it off, and
I think it's gonna make a difference.

03:58.071 --> 03:59.321
So, uh, Eric...

03:59.530 --> 04:01.657
...what kind of photography do you do?

04:01.866 --> 04:03.367
Oh, mostly fashion.

04:03.618 --> 04:06.453
There may be models here sometimes.
I hope that's cool.

04:08.748 --> 04:10.207
Yes, that is cool.

04:10.875 --> 04:13.335
Uh, because I have models here,
you know...

04:14.629 --> 04:16.505
...never.

04:17.548 --> 04:21.760
Ooh! During the summer, I spend most
weekends at my sister's beach house...

04:21.970 --> 04:23.845
...which you're welcome to use.

04:24.055 --> 04:27.266
Although I should tell you,
she's a porn star.

04:30.019 --> 04:32.896
Well, I still have
one more person to meet.

04:33.147 --> 04:36.024
But unless it turns out
to be your sister...

04:36.651 --> 04:38.902
...ahem, I think your chances
are pretty good.

04:39.654 --> 04:40.862
All right.

04:45.201 --> 04:47.077
Bedroom, bathroom, living room.

04:47.287 --> 04:51.123
This here is the kitchen,
and thanks for coming by. Bye-bye.

04:51.958 --> 04:54.376
Don't you, uh, wanna ask me
any questions?

04:56.754 --> 04:58.922
Sure. Uh... Hmm...

04:59.882 --> 05:01.174
What's up?

05:02.385 --> 05:04.594
Well, I'm an actor.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.388
I'm fairly neat.

05:07.473 --> 05:09.224
I got my own TV.

05:09.434 --> 05:13.145
Oh, and don't worry, I'm totally
okay with the gay thing.

05:15.356 --> 05:17.149
Ha, ha. What gay thing?

05:18.151 --> 05:23.196
Uh, just, you know, in general.
The whole people-being-gay thing.

05:24.574 --> 05:26.033
Totally cool with that.

05:29.787 --> 05:32.331
Okay, Jerry.
Thanks for stopping by.

05:35.335 --> 05:38.086
- Hi.
- Hey.

05:40.548 --> 05:41.590
Oh, my God!

05:50.350 --> 05:51.433
Hey, Mon.

05:52.435 --> 05:55.687
- Wanna hear something that sucks?
- Do I ever!

05:57.023 --> 05:59.691
- Chris says they're closing the bar.
- No way!

05:59.942 --> 06:02.152
They're turning it into
a coffee place.

06:02.362 --> 06:03.820
Just coffee?

06:04.489 --> 06:07.157
- Where are we gonna hang out?
- You got me.

06:07.367 --> 06:09.951
- Can I get a beer?
- Did you pick a roommate?

06:10.161 --> 06:12.120
- You bet.
- Is it the Italian guy?

06:12.288 --> 06:13.497
Hmm, yeah, right.

06:15.124 --> 06:16.166
He's so cute.

06:16.459 --> 06:19.169
That's what I want.
A roommate I can walk around with...

06:19.462 --> 06:21.755
...and be referred to
as "the funny one."

06:22.340 --> 06:24.674
Table's free. Rack them up.
Back in a minute.

06:24.884 --> 06:27.177
Get ready for me to whip your butt.

06:27.387 --> 06:30.305
Okay, but after that
we're shooting some pool.

06:31.516 --> 06:35.602
Oh, ahem, no, no, no.
Excuse me? Hello? Hi.

06:36.813 --> 06:39.106
My friend ordered an onion...

06:39.357 --> 06:41.149
...not an olive.

06:41.359 --> 06:44.277
And I ordered a rum and Diet Coke...

06:44.487 --> 06:46.696
...which I don't think this is.

06:47.073 --> 06:49.157
- I am so sorry.
- That's all right.

06:50.576 --> 06:53.036
How hard is it to get a couple
drinks right, huh?

06:55.498 --> 06:56.665
Well...

06:57.500 --> 06:59.501
I would like to propose a toast...

07:00.211 --> 07:03.296
...to the woman who, in one year
from today, will become...

07:03.548 --> 07:06.675
...Mrs. Dr. Barry Farber, D.D.S.

07:07.427 --> 07:10.345
I think it's time
to see the ring again.

07:13.850 --> 07:19.354
Ugh! Isn't it exciting? I mean,
it's like having a boyfriend for life! Heh!

07:21.023 --> 07:24.443
Ahem. Yeah, I know.

07:25.361 --> 07:26.403
What?

07:26.654 --> 07:28.655
Oh, I don't know.

07:29.407 --> 07:32.409
Well, maybe it's just the idea...

07:32.660 --> 07:35.203
...of Barry for the rest of my life.

07:35.413 --> 07:36.830
I don't know, I think I...

07:37.081 --> 07:39.040
I feel like having
one last fling...

07:39.292 --> 07:42.252
...just to sort of get it
out of my system.

07:44.547 --> 07:47.090
- Rachel, stop!
- You're so bad! Ha!

07:47.341 --> 07:51.136
I'm serious. I really think
I need to just have...

07:51.387 --> 07:53.555
...some meaningless sex,
you know?

07:53.723 --> 07:56.475
With the next guy I see.

08:02.732 --> 08:06.234
Excuse me, I seem to have
dropped my ball.

08:08.279 --> 08:09.321
Yeah, so?

08:12.074 --> 08:14.367
And now I've picked it up again.

08:17.705 --> 08:20.457
My God!
I went to high school with her.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.083
Rachel!

08:22.460 --> 08:23.668
Hi.

08:24.253 --> 08:25.629
Monica!

08:25.838 --> 08:28.340
Look! Hi! What do you think?

08:28.591 --> 08:29.841
Oh, my God!

08:30.092 --> 08:32.719
You can't even see
where the Titanic hit it.

08:33.346 --> 08:36.847
Yes, his name is Barry.
He's a doctor, thank you very much.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.643
Aw, just like you always wanted.
Congratulations.

08:39.894 --> 08:43.688
Thank you. So how about you?
Are you seeing anybody?

08:43.940 --> 08:45.315
Not right now.

08:45.733 --> 08:47.275
Oh, well, that's okay.

08:48.486 --> 08:49.528
I know.

08:54.200 --> 08:56.493
So I think I'll get back
to my friend.

08:56.702 --> 08:59.120
Oh, yeah. Sure, sure, sure.

09:02.833 --> 09:05.961
Can we have lunch
the next time I'm in the city?

09:06.212 --> 09:07.337
That'd be great.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.339
- Okay. Bye.
- Thanks. Bye.

09:10.883 --> 09:14.511
Ten bucks says I never see
that woman again in my life.

09:15.304 --> 09:17.681
No, honey, really. It's fine.

09:17.932 --> 09:20.517
Just go with Susan.

09:20.768 --> 09:21.851
Really, I think...

09:22.645 --> 09:25.146
I think girls' night out
is a great idea.

09:27.233 --> 09:28.858
Okay. Okay. Bye.

09:29.402 --> 09:32.779
- What are they doing?
- I don't know. Something girly.

09:36.659 --> 09:37.909
Hey, you're early.

09:38.160 --> 09:40.078
What are you doing with the lamp?

09:40.580 --> 09:42.497
Just taking it to get rewired.

09:44.333 --> 09:49.045
Don't take it where you took the
stereo. They've had that over a week.

09:56.512 --> 10:00.015
No, no. Mr. Heckles, no one is making
any noise up here.

10:00.558 --> 10:02.934
You're disturbing my oboe practice.

10:03.311 --> 10:06.438
- You don't play the oboe.
- I could play the oboe.

10:07.356 --> 10:10.317
Then I'm gonna have to ask you
to keep it down.

10:15.573 --> 10:16.615
Who are you?

10:17.074 --> 10:20.619
- I'm Eric, Chandler's new roommate.
- I'm Chandler's new roommate.

10:22.705 --> 10:25.498
- I don't think so.
- I could be Chandler's new roommate.

10:26.250 --> 10:29.127
- But he told me over the phone...
- He told me in person.

10:30.379 --> 10:31.421
That's weird.

10:31.714 --> 10:34.883
I'm going to, uh, go into
my new apartment now.

10:38.763 --> 10:40.221
Huh?

10:54.945 --> 10:56.237
Hi again.

10:56.947 --> 11:03.912
Hey.

11:04.288 --> 11:05.622
Thank you so much.

11:05.873 --> 11:09.250
Don't thank me.
Thank the jerk that never showed up.

11:09.418 --> 11:11.670
Okay, I gotta get to work.

11:12.755 --> 11:15.256
- You want some help?
- No, thanks. I got it.

11:15.424 --> 11:17.759
- No, I don't!
- Whoa! Ha, ha.

11:17.927 --> 11:21.221
- You okay?
- Yeah. Phew!

11:21.389 --> 11:23.932
I stood up too fast.
Got a little head rush.

11:24.850 --> 11:26.267
It's the heat.

11:29.605 --> 11:31.272
And the humidity.

11:33.776 --> 11:35.026
That's...

11:35.277 --> 11:36.528
...a tough combination.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.785
Do you want to come in
for some lemonade?

11:44.453 --> 11:45.787
Like you wouldn't believe.

11:51.752 --> 11:54.879
Wow. This is a great place.

11:56.215 --> 11:57.298
Thank you.

11:58.217 --> 12:00.427
Just make yourself comfortable.

12:01.429 --> 12:02.595
Gotcha.

12:05.307 --> 12:08.351
So this place is really
my grandmother's.

12:11.564 --> 12:16.484
I got it when she moved to Florida.
Otherwise I could never afford it.

12:20.740 --> 12:22.532
So if the landlord ever asks...

12:22.742 --> 12:26.494
...I'm an 87-year-old woman who's
afraid of her VCR. You thirsty?

12:26.746 --> 12:28.830
You bet I am!

12:30.166 --> 12:31.166
Okay...

12:31.417 --> 12:32.959
...here's your penis!

12:38.674 --> 12:41.843
Oh, my God!
What the hell are you doing?

12:42.136 --> 12:44.846
You said, "You wanna come in
for some lemonade?"

12:45.055 --> 12:46.347
So?

12:47.892 --> 12:51.269
- Ah! Were you just gonna give me lemonade?
- Yuh-huh!

12:51.937 --> 12:53.021
Cover yourself up!

12:53.522 --> 12:54.731
Oh, right. Sorry.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.524
God, I don't believe this!

12:56.734 --> 13:00.528
Someone asks you in for lemonade
and that means they want to have sex?

13:00.696 --> 13:03.656
Usually, yeah.
Well, not just lemonade...

13:03.866 --> 13:06.034
...iced tea, sometimes juice.

13:07.870 --> 13:10.038
Look, sorry. I just...

13:10.706 --> 13:12.040
I thought you liked me.

13:12.249 --> 13:14.083
I'm such a jerk.

13:16.337 --> 13:17.378
It's okay.

13:18.714 --> 13:21.049
I suppose it could happen to anyone.

13:21.342 --> 13:23.009
Not anyone I know, but...

13:26.055 --> 13:28.348
By the way, I can still see it.

13:39.902 --> 13:41.236
- Pheebs?
- Huh?

13:41.487 --> 13:42.570
Where's your bed?

13:45.741 --> 13:47.992
It's not in the apartment?

13:50.079 --> 13:51.788
Oh, no!

13:53.707 --> 13:56.125
I can't believe this
is happening again.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.755
- What?
- Okay, enough with the third degree!

14:02.633 --> 14:05.051
I don't live here anymore.

14:05.636 --> 14:08.763
- What are you talking about?
- I'm sorry.

14:09.014 --> 14:11.808
I don't live here anymore.

14:13.769 --> 14:17.897
I didn't know how to tell you.
But, you know, everybody else knows.

14:20.234 --> 14:22.402
Everybody knows?

14:22.611 --> 14:25.947
That was supposed to be a good thing.
I forget why.

14:28.117 --> 14:31.953
Monica, do you know I couldn't sleep
for a month...

14:32.246 --> 14:35.623
...because I got a dot of ink
on one of the sofa cushions?

14:36.166 --> 14:38.459
You could've just turned
the cushion over.

14:38.669 --> 14:41.671
I would have, but I had
a spaghetti stain on the other side.

14:41.964 --> 14:42.964
What?

14:43.257 --> 14:45.133
This is what I'm talking about.

14:45.342 --> 14:48.761
I need to live in a land
where people can spill!

14:50.055 --> 14:51.639
Well, you can spill.

14:52.308 --> 14:53.641
In the sink.

14:54.560 --> 14:58.688
Oh, honey. It's not your fault,
you know. This is who you are.

14:58.939 --> 15:01.858
And I love you.
And I want us to be friends.

15:02.109 --> 15:04.819
And if I stay here,
I don't see that happening.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.324
- I love you too.
- Good.

15:12.661 --> 15:13.703
What?

15:15.497 --> 15:16.998
What? I'm just sad.

15:17.791 --> 15:20.460
No, you're not.
You're wondering which cushion it is.

15:26.967 --> 15:29.344
So what are you watching?

15:29.595 --> 15:30.637
Baywatch.

15:32.723 --> 15:34.223
What's it about?

15:35.976 --> 15:37.352
Lifeguards.

15:38.187 --> 15:40.688
Well, it sounds kind of stup...

15:41.315 --> 15:42.315
Who's she?

15:43.859 --> 15:45.026
Nicole Eggert.

15:45.694 --> 15:47.153
We like her.

15:53.202 --> 15:54.869
Wow! Look at them run!

15:57.206 --> 15:58.623
They do that a lot.

16:01.710 --> 16:03.211
Hey, you want a beer?

16:03.504 --> 16:06.422
- I'll get one.
- Don't get up. I got a cooler here.

16:11.178 --> 16:12.637
- Hello?
- Hey.

16:12.888 --> 16:15.264
Do you have any beers?
We're out of beers.

16:15.516 --> 16:17.392
Help yourself.

16:18.018 --> 16:19.352
You okay?

16:22.064 --> 16:23.398
Phoebe moved out.

16:25.859 --> 16:26.901
Right.

16:27.778 --> 16:29.737
I don't understand.

16:29.947 --> 16:34.450
Am I so hard to live with?
Is this why I don't have a boyfriend?

16:34.702 --> 16:35.743
No...

16:35.911 --> 16:38.746
You don't have a boyfriend because...

16:40.207 --> 16:43.668
I don't know why
you don't have a boyfriend.

16:44.420 --> 16:46.254
You should have a boyfriend.

16:47.381 --> 16:48.798
I think so.

16:51.093 --> 16:53.428
Come here.

16:56.056 --> 16:59.267
Listen, you are one
of my favorite people...

16:59.476 --> 17:03.688
...and the most beautiful woman
I've ever known in real life.

17:17.578 --> 17:18.618
Hi.

17:21.123 --> 17:22.790
Where is everybody?

17:22.958 --> 17:27.127
Ugh, it's already closed. Chris gave me
the keys to lock up. What is wrong?

17:27.337 --> 17:30.256
I think my marriage...

17:30.632 --> 17:31.799
...is kind of over.

17:32.301 --> 17:34.135
Oh, no! Why?

17:34.303 --> 17:36.471
Because Carol's a lesbian.

17:41.018 --> 17:42.602
And I'm not one.

17:46.607 --> 17:49.484
And apparently it's not
a mix-and-match situation.

17:50.152 --> 17:51.778
Oh, my God!

17:53.155 --> 17:54.655
I don't believe it!

17:55.783 --> 17:57.658
Oh, you poor bunny.

17:59.369 --> 18:00.661
I'm an idiot.

18:01.497 --> 18:03.331
I mean, I should have seen it.

18:03.499 --> 18:08.544
I mean, Carol and I would be out,
and she'd see some beautiful woman...

18:08.837 --> 18:12.006
...and she'd be, "Ross! Look at her!"

18:12.257 --> 18:13.674
And I'd think:

18:14.468 --> 18:16.636
"God, my wife is cool." Heh.

18:21.850 --> 18:26.854
Aw. Hey, do you think that Susan person
is her lover?

18:29.858 --> 18:31.651
Well, now I do!

18:33.529 --> 18:34.570
I'm sorry.

18:37.199 --> 18:38.866
Seven years!

18:39.576 --> 18:42.703
I mean, we've been together
seven years.

18:43.372 --> 18:46.040
She's the only woman
who's ever loved me.

18:46.333 --> 18:48.876
She's the only woman I've ever...

18:50.712 --> 18:52.046
Oh, Ross.

18:55.217 --> 18:57.677
Mm. This is nice.

18:57.886 --> 18:59.554
I know. It is, isn't it?

19:01.390 --> 19:04.392
No, I mean it.
This feels really good.

19:06.687 --> 19:09.021
Is it 100 percent cotton?

19:12.568 --> 19:13.568
Yeah...

19:13.819 --> 19:15.570
...and I got it on sale too.

19:16.780 --> 19:17.822
I should go.

19:18.073 --> 19:22.243
One of the lifeguards was just about
to dismantle a nuclear device.

19:23.078 --> 19:25.454
If you want to get
a drink later, we can.

19:25.706 --> 19:27.123
That sounds great.

19:27.916 --> 19:29.834
Oh, and listen, it's gonna be...

19:30.252 --> 19:31.252
I know.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.254
Thanks.

19:37.634 --> 19:41.721
Maybe this wouldn't have happened
if I'd been more nurturing...

19:42.222 --> 19:45.641
...or I'd paid more attention...

19:45.976 --> 19:47.852
...or I had a uterus.

19:49.771 --> 19:51.564
- I can't believe it.
- I know.

19:51.773 --> 19:55.109
You know, you don't deserve this.
You don't, Ross.

19:55.402 --> 19:57.111
- You're so good.
- Thanks.

19:57.362 --> 19:59.071
And you're so sweet.

19:59.281 --> 20:01.782
- Thanks.
- And you're kind.

20:01.950 --> 20:03.242
Thanks.

20:14.588 --> 20:15.588
Come here.

20:17.382 --> 20:18.966
Wait, wait, wait.

20:23.889 --> 20:25.139
It's okay.

20:31.647 --> 20:34.815
Wait, wait, wait!
My foot is stuck in the pocket.

20:36.401 --> 20:38.152
- What?
- I can't get it out.

20:38.403 --> 20:41.155
That's not something
a girl wants to hear.

20:41.490 --> 20:43.157
Come on, don't start.

20:44.534 --> 20:45.785
- Ow!
- What?

20:45.994 --> 20:48.496
Stupid balls are in the way.

21:07.140 --> 21:08.182
Oh, well.

21:09.518 --> 21:13.646
That probably wouldn't have been
the most constructive solution.

21:14.523 --> 21:16.440
You have chalk on your face.

21:17.859 --> 21:21.988
Ugh. You're right. I don't know why
I always thought this was real grass.

21:29.162 --> 21:30.579
Honey, you okay?

21:31.873 --> 21:33.958
My wife's a lesbian.

21:34.584 --> 21:36.210
Cool!

21:39.715 --> 21:42.008
Ross, Joey. Joey, Ross.

21:51.184 --> 21:53.311
I can't believe you came back.

21:54.271 --> 21:56.188
Don't say anything.

21:56.773 --> 21:59.900
I don't wanna speak.
I don't wanna think.

22:00.068 --> 22:04.905
I just want you to take me and kiss me
and make love to me right here...

22:05.157 --> 22:06.407
...right now.

22:08.243 --> 22:12.621
It's the time of the season

22:13.582 --> 22:14.749
When love runs high

22:14.916 --> 22:16.000
KIKl:
Rachel!

22:16.710 --> 22:17.752
Rachel!

22:18.128 --> 22:20.880
- What?
- You missed the exit.

22:21.757 --> 22:23.591
Oh! Sorry.

22:23.884 --> 22:26.761
My God, what were you thinking about?

22:26.928 --> 22:28.929
Ahem, um...

22:29.097 --> 22:30.431
Barry.

22:31.224 --> 22:32.725
Aw.
