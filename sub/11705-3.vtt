WEBVTT

00:02.794 --> 00:05.547
{\an8}- THE BITCH OF STATEN ISLAND
IS BACK.

00:05.630 --> 00:07.590
{\an8}HEY.
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

00:07.674 --> 00:09.175
{\an8}ANGELINA--LIKE, I THOUGHT
I SAW A GHOST.

00:09.259 --> 00:10.093
{\an8}- YOU WANT
TO GET YOUR ASS BEAT?

00:10.176 --> 00:11.177
{\an8}YOU CAN STAY,
GET YOUR ASS BEAT.

00:11.261 --> 00:12.345
{\an8}YOU CAN STAY,
GET YOUR [bleep] ASS BEAT.

00:12.429 --> 00:14.431
{\an8}- OKAY.

00:14.514 --> 00:15.724
{\an8}- YOU CAN STAY,
GET YOUR [bleep] ASS BEAT.

00:15.807 --> 00:17.016
{\an8}- HI.
- OH, MY GOD.

00:17.100 --> 00:18.977
{\an8}HELLO? I'M ENTERING A HOUSE
WITH MY EX-BOYFRIEND.

00:19.060 --> 00:21.563
{\an8}- I DON'T KNOW
WHAT TO DO, SAM.

00:21.646 --> 00:23.815
{\an8}IF YOU WANT TO WORK ON [bleep],
WE CAN WORK ON [bleep].

00:23.898 --> 00:24.941
{\an8}YOU KNOW, IT'S WEIRD.

00:25.024 --> 00:26.985
{\an8}WE'RE EX-BOYFRIEND
AND GIRLFRIEND

00:27.068 --> 00:27.736
{\an8}AND WE'RE HANGING OUT
WITH EACH OTHER.

00:27.819 --> 00:29.112
{\an8}LIKE, NO ONE DOES THAT.

00:29.195 --> 00:32.031
{\an8}- TALKING TO A GIRL
THAT WAS MARRIED.

00:32.115 --> 00:33.158
{\an8}- DON'T WORRY ABOUT
WHAT THE [bleep] I'M DOING.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.994
{\an8}- YOU JUST DON'T CARE.
LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

00:36.077 --> 00:37.787
{\an8}- WHAT?
- I'M DONE.

00:37.871 --> 00:39.581
{\an8}YOU'RE ON YOUR [bleep] OWN.

00:47.046 --> 00:49.716
{\an8}- STOP BEING A [bleep].
- BEING A [bleep]? I'M FINE.

00:49.799 --> 00:51.384
{\an8}GO TO BED.
- PAULY, STOP BEING A JERK-OFF.

00:51.468 --> 00:52.594
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL DID I DO?

00:52.677 --> 00:54.304
{\an8}TONIGHT, ME, SITCH,
AND ANGELINA GOT HOME.

00:54.387 --> 00:55.513
{\an8}AND ANGELINA'S SAYING
ALL THESE THINGS TO US.

00:55.597 --> 00:57.807
{\an8}SHE'S GETTING AT US.
LIKE, THE GIRL'S DRUNK.

00:57.891 --> 00:59.267
{\an8}SHE'S A MESS.

00:59.350 --> 01:00.310
{\an8}- I KNOW YOU'RE CRYING
RIGHT NOW, BABY, BUT, LIKE...

01:00.393 --> 01:04.480
{\an8}- YOU JUST DON'T CARE.
LIKE, SERIOUSLY.

01:04.563 --> 01:06.691
{\an8}- NOT COOL.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.859
{\an8}- I DARE YOU TO SMACK ME
ONE MORE TIME.

01:07.942 --> 01:09.486
{\an8}- YOU JUST SMACKED HIM.
- I DARE YOU.

01:09.569 --> 01:11.070
{\an8}- ONE MORE TIME.
- DO IT ONE MORE TIME.

01:11.154 --> 01:13.364
{\an8}SMACK ME.
GET THE [bleep] AWAY FROM ME.

01:13.448 --> 01:14.824
{\an8}- PAULY.
- OH, MY GOD, ANGELINA.

01:14.908 --> 01:17.786
{\an8}YOU ARE [bleep] DRUNK.
GET IN YOUR [bleep] BED!

01:17.869 --> 01:20.163
{\an8}- MOST ANNOYING THING IS, I'M
TRYING TO END THE CONVERSATION,

01:20.246 --> 01:21.331
{\an8}TRYING TO END THE FIGHT,

01:21.414 --> 01:21.998
{\an8}AND THEN I'LL WALK
TO A DIFFERENT ROOM.

01:22.081 --> 01:23.041
{\an8}SHE WOULD FOLLOW ME.

01:23.124 --> 01:25.919
{\an8}- LIKE, SERIOUSLY
LIKE A 12-YEAR-OLD.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.128
{\an8}- ARE YOU TOUCHING ME?
STOP TOUCHING ME.

01:27.212 --> 01:30.131
{\an8}- I GET WOKEN UP
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT

01:30.215 --> 01:33.343
{\an8}TO HEAR MIKE AND PAULY
SCREAMING AT ANGELINA.

01:33.426 --> 01:34.677
{\an8}AND I'M LIKE,
"WHAT THE [bleep]?"

01:34.761 --> 01:37.013
{\an8}IS THERE A PROBLEM?

01:37.096 --> 01:39.182
{\an8}- THIS [bleep] NEEDS TO LEAVE
THIS [bleep] HOUSE,

01:39.265 --> 01:40.850
{\an8}IS WHAT SHE NEEDS TO DO.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.187
{\an8}- PAULY IS, LIKE,
THE NICEST KID IN THE HOUSE.

01:44.270 --> 01:47.524
{\an8}SO I WAS PRETTY SHOCKED
TO SEE HIM SO MAD.

01:47.607 --> 01:49.150
{\an8}- SHE SMACKED PAULY THREE TIMES
JUST NOW IN THE FACE.

01:49.234 --> 01:51.361
{\an8}SHE SMACKED HIM THREE TIMES.
- SHE HAS ZERO CLUE.

01:51.444 --> 01:54.614
{\an8}- JENNI, I HAVE NOTHING TO DO
WITH THIS TONIGHT.

01:54.697 --> 01:55.949
{\an8}- YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE DRUNK RIGHT NOW.

01:56.032 --> 01:57.075
{\an8}- YOU'RE DONE.

01:57.158 --> 01:58.785
{\an8}- WHAT WOULD GIVE YOU THE RIGHT
TO SMACK PAULY?

01:58.868 --> 02:00.203
{\an8}- I DIDN'T SMACK HIM.
- WHAT? THREE TIMES.

02:00.286 --> 02:01.871
{\an8}- THE GIRL THAT I WAS WITH
SMACKED HIM.

02:01.955 --> 02:02.997
{\an8}I HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH IT.

02:03.081 --> 02:04.707
{\an8}I WALKED OUT
OF THE [bleep] PLACE.

02:04.791 --> 02:08.169
{\an8}- THREE TIMES. THREE TIMES
YOU SMACKED HIM IN THE FACE.

02:08.252 --> 02:09.920
{\an8}- OKAY, WELL, THAT WASN'T ME.

02:10.003 --> 02:11.047
{\an8}I DIDN'T--I DIDN'T DO ANYTHING
ABOUT IT.

02:11.131 --> 02:12.632
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:12.715 --> 02:14.801
{\an8}- THE GIRL WAS BLONDE,

02:14.884 --> 02:16.177
{\an8}THE GIRL THAT HOOKED UP WITH YOU
AND HER FRIENDS.

02:16.261 --> 02:17.178
{\an8}- WHAT?

02:17.262 --> 02:18.555
{\an8}- WHAT THE HELL
ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

02:18.638 --> 02:19.806
{\an8}I'M TALKING ABOUT RIGHT NOW!

02:19.889 --> 02:21.015
{\an8}- LISTEN,
I DIDN'T SMACK YOU AT ALL.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.767
{\an8}I'M STANDING HERE
BY MYSELF.

02:22.851 --> 02:24.394
{\an8}EVERYBODY ELSE IS AROUND ME.
- WHAT THE [bleep]?

02:24.477 --> 02:27.146
{\an8}ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?
- ARE YOU DELUSIONAL?

02:27.230 --> 02:29.732
{\an8}- I SEEN DRUNK PEOPLE BEFORE,
BUT THAT WAS, LIKE, BIPOLAR.

02:29.816 --> 02:30.733
{\an8}I NEVER SEEN THAT BEFORE.

02:30.817 --> 02:32.277
{\an8}THAT'S--I THINK
THAT'S A PROBLEM.

02:32.360 --> 02:33.570
{\an8}- YOU HOOKED UP WITH A GIRL THAT
I WAS WITH ALL NIGHT.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.989
{\an8}- NONE OF YOUR BUSINESS!
- IT'S NONE OF YOUR [bleep]--

02:36.072 --> 02:37.365
{\an8}- I DON'T CARE
WHAT YOU GUYS DO!

02:37.448 --> 02:38.783
{\an8}- OBVIOUSLY, YOU DO!
- OH, MY GOD!

02:38.867 --> 02:40.451
{\an8}- YOU GUYS
ARE SUCH INSTIGATORS, MAN.

02:40.535 --> 02:42.537
{\an8}- IT WAS JUST, LIKE,
UNBELIEVABLE.

02:42.620 --> 02:45.748
{\an8}WE BROUGHT YOU OUT TONIGHT.
WE PAID FOR THE BILL.

02:45.832 --> 02:47.125
{\an8}YOU DIDN'T EVEN CHIP
THE [bleep] IN.

02:47.208 --> 02:49.460
{\an8}- WOW, YOU KNOW WHAT? I'M JUST
GONNA GET AWAY FROM YOU--

02:49.544 --> 02:51.504
{\an8}GO TO SLEEP, BABE--
AND DEAL WITH THIS TOMORROW.

02:51.588 --> 02:53.047
{\an8}SHE'S DONE. SHE'S DONE.

02:53.131 --> 02:54.424
{\an8}- I CAN'T BELIEVE
THAT SHE WOULD STEP

02:54.507 --> 02:56.551
{\an8}ON THE ONLY TOES
THAT SHE HAD IN THE HOUSE.

02:56.634 --> 02:58.261
{\an8}THE ONLY LIFELINE SHE HAD
WAS ME AND SITUATION.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.512
{\an8}NOW SHE'S SCREWED.

02:59.596 --> 03:01.431
{\an8}- JENNI, I DIDN'T SMACK
[bleep] PAULY AT ALL.

03:01.514 --> 03:04.058
{\an8}- LISTEN, AT THE END OF THE DAY,
THAT KID'S MY BROTHER.

03:04.142 --> 03:06.811
{\an8}AND IF HE CAN'T HIT YOU,
I CAN.

03:06.895 --> 03:08.104
{\an8}AND YOU'RE LUCKY
YOU'RE THIS DRUNK.

03:08.187 --> 03:09.355
{\an8}WAIT TILL TOMORROW.

03:09.439 --> 03:12.942
{\an8}- THAT GIRL'S CRAZY.
AND I DON'T GET MAD.

03:13.026 --> 03:15.987
{\an8}- ♪ HELLO, DRAMA, HELLO ♪

03:21.159 --> 03:23.453
{\an8}- THIS MORNING
I HAVE TO START MY NEW JOB

03:23.536 --> 03:26.497
{\an8}AT THE GELATO SHOP,
ALONG WITH JENNI AND RONNIE.

03:26.581 --> 03:29.834
{\an8}IT'S A LONGER WALK
THAN THE SHORE STORE, HUH?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.462
{\an8}- IT'S RIGHT HERE.
- GOOD MORNING, GUYS.

03:32.545 --> 03:34.505
{\an8}HOW YOU DOING?
COME IN. COME IN.

03:34.589 --> 03:37.133
{\an8}WE'RE GONNA START WITH--
I'LL GIVE YOU THE T-SHIRT.

03:37.216 --> 03:38.134
{\an8}YOU SEE. IT LOOKS LIKE THIS.
- NICE.

03:38.217 --> 03:40.845
{\an8}- AND THE HAT,
IT LOOKS LIKE THAT.

03:40.929 --> 03:42.305
{\an8}- PERFECT.
- IT'S OKAY?

03:42.388 --> 03:45.808
{\an8}- CAN I WEAR THIS ONE?
- NO. EVERYBODY'S THE SAME.

03:45.892 --> 03:48.019
{\an8}- WHEN WE GET THERE,
OUR BOSS, ENZO,

03:48.102 --> 03:50.021
{\an8}MAKES ME PUT ON
THIS BLACK T-SHIRT

03:50.104 --> 03:53.441
{\an8}THAT SUFFOCATES MY GIRLS.

03:53.524 --> 03:56.694
{\an8}IT WAS LIKE, "COME ON,
LET THE GIRLS BREATHE."

03:56.778 --> 03:58.071
{\an8}- OKAY, WHEN WE COME
IN THE MORNING,

03:58.154 --> 04:00.156
{\an8}NORMALLY WE CLEAN THE DISPLAY
LIKE THIS.

04:00.239 --> 04:02.325
{\an8}YOU SEE ALL THE DIRTY
OF THE ICE CREAM?

04:02.408 --> 04:04.369
{\an8}NOW WE PUT THESE THINGS ON
LIKE THIS.

04:04.452 --> 04:05.912
{\an8}MILK--WE'RE GONNA PUT
TWO LITERS, LIKE THIS.

04:05.995 --> 04:08.998
{\an8}CLEAN THE TABLE LIKE THIS.

04:09.082 --> 04:11.000
{\an8}YOU CANNOT USE THE OLD SPOON.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.627
{\an8}YOU HAVE TO USE ONE SCOOP

04:12.710 --> 04:15.338
{\an8}TO SERVE THE ICE CREAM
EVERY TIME.

04:15.421 --> 04:16.839
{\an8}OKAY.
JENNI, LET ME SEE.

04:16.923 --> 04:18.966
{\an8}- ENZO IS VERY STRICT.

04:19.050 --> 04:21.511
{\an8}GOD FORBID I CUT A MELON
TOO SMALL AND TOO TINY,

04:21.594 --> 04:24.681
{\an8}BUT YET THEY'RE GOING
TO BE BLENDED ANYWAYS.

04:24.764 --> 04:26.349
{\an8}IT'S NO GOOD.

04:29.435 --> 04:33.022
{\an8}- WHAT YOU WANT ME TO CALL?
VINNY? VINCENT? VINCENZO?

04:33.106 --> 04:34.941
{\an8}WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO CALL?
- UH, YOU CAN CALL ME VINCENZO.

04:35.024 --> 04:36.025
{\an8}- VINCENZO.

04:36.109 --> 04:37.443
{\an8}- I WANT TO BRUSH UP
ON MY ITALIAN WITH YOU.

04:37.527 --> 04:38.820
{\an8}- VERY GOOD.

04:38.903 --> 04:40.530
{\an8}- SO I'M GONNA SPEAK ITALIAN
TO YOU, OKAY?

04:40.613 --> 04:41.990
{\an8}- [speaks Italian]
- SI.

04:42.073 --> 04:43.825
{\an8}I ACTUALLY REALLY LIKE ENZO.

04:43.908 --> 04:46.202
{\an8}THE FACT THAT ENZO'S
CALLING ME VINCENZO

04:46.286 --> 04:47.912
{\an8}DEFINITELY MAKES ME FEEL
CLOSE TO HOME.

04:47.996 --> 04:50.373
{\an8}THAT'S WHAT ALL THE OLD-SCHOOL
ITALIANS IN MY FAMILY CALL ME.

04:50.456 --> 04:51.791
{\an8}LOOK AT THIS.
LOOK AT THIS SANDWICH.

04:51.874 --> 04:53.042
{\an8}ISN'T THAT BEAUTIFUL?
- PERFECTION.

04:53.126 --> 04:55.795
{\an8}- ENZO.
- OH, GOD. SUCK-ASS.

04:55.878 --> 04:58.464
{\an8}- I MADE THIS.
ISN'T THIS BEAUTIFUL?

04:58.548 --> 05:00.216
{\an8}- VINCENZO, YOU'RE GONNA BE
THE KING OF THE SANDWICH.

05:00.299 --> 05:02.719
{\an8}- WHATEVER JOB
THAT IS GIVEN TO ME,

05:02.802 --> 05:04.679
{\an8}I WILL MAKE THE BEST OF IT,
AND I'LL SKILL IT.

05:04.762 --> 05:07.390
{\an8}PLUS, IT'S SCOOPING ICE CREAM.
CHICKS LOVE ICE CREAM.

05:07.473 --> 05:08.725
{\an8}I'M VINNY. NICE TO MEET YOU.
YEAH.

05:08.808 --> 05:09.976
{\an8}HOPEFULLY WE'LL RUN
INTO YOU GUYS.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.394
{\an8}ALL RIGHT, TAKE CARE.

05:24.365 --> 05:27.076
{\an8}- I WOKE UP THIS MORNING,
AND I'M LIKE,

05:27.160 --> 05:28.161
{\an8}"SOMETHING IS WRONG.

05:28.244 --> 05:30.705
{\an8}PAULY AND MIKE
ARE IGNORING ME NOW."

05:30.788 --> 05:32.081
{\an8}I THINK I GOT INTO A FIGHT
WITH PAULY.

05:32.165 --> 05:34.083
{\an8}I DON'T EVEN KNOW.

05:34.167 --> 05:36.044
{\an8}HOW DRUNK WAS I LAST NIGHT?

05:36.127 --> 05:37.587
{\an8}- I THOUGHT RONNIE WAS BAD
THE FIRST NIGHT.

05:37.670 --> 05:38.838
{\an8}BUT YOU MIGHT'VE TAKEN
THE CAKE.

05:38.921 --> 05:41.799
{\an8}- WHAT WAS I SAYING TO PAULY
THAT HE'S UPSET WITH ME?

05:41.883 --> 05:42.717
{\an8}- UM, YOU SMACKED HIM
THREE TIMES.

05:42.800 --> 05:44.927
{\an8}- [gasps]

05:45.011 --> 05:47.263
{\an8}- YOU REFERENCED HIM HOOKING UP
WITH MARRIED GIRLS.

05:47.346 --> 05:50.016
{\an8}OR YOU WERE JUST TALKING
MAD [bleep].

05:50.099 --> 05:51.476
{\an8}- I JUST--I WAS LIKE,
"[bleep].

05:51.559 --> 05:53.227
{\an8}I THINK I [bleep] UP BAD,"
YOU KNOW?

05:53.311 --> 05:54.771
{\an8}CAN I TALK TO YOU?
COME HERE.

05:54.854 --> 05:59.275
{\an8}JUST PLEASE, LIKE--
I'M, LIKE, REALLY UPSET.

05:59.358 --> 06:02.737
{\an8}FIRST OF ALL...

06:02.820 --> 06:04.447
{\an8}I'M GONNA CRY.

06:04.530 --> 06:08.534
{\an8}LIKE, I DON'T KNOW
WHAT HAPPENED LAST NIGHT.

06:08.618 --> 06:10.828
{\an8}I HAVE NO IDEA.

06:10.912 --> 06:13.289
{\an8}AND I WAS, LIKE, REALLY,
REALLY, REALLY DRUNK

06:13.372 --> 06:14.707
{\an8}BECAUSE I'M NOT
COMFORTABLE HERE.

06:14.791 --> 06:19.712
{\an8}SO I'M SORRY.
I JUST DON'T KNOW WHAT TO DO.

06:19.796 --> 06:22.507
{\an8}LIKE, I'M TRYING TO BE COOL
WITH EVERYONE.

06:22.590 --> 06:24.425
{\an8}WHAT CAN I DO TO MAKE YOU GUYS
ACCEPT ME?

06:24.509 --> 06:27.387
{\an8}- EVERYTHING WAS FINE
TILL LAST NIGHT.

06:27.470 --> 06:29.555
{\an8}YOU HAD TWO PEOPLE
IN THIS HOUSE

06:29.639 --> 06:31.474
{\an8}THAT YOU
COULD'VE BEEN COOL WITH.

06:31.557 --> 06:33.893
{\an8}BUT NOW AFTER LAST NIGHT,
YOU CROSSED THE LINE.

06:33.976 --> 06:36.187
{\an8}SO I ACCEPT THE APOLOGY,
BUT WE GO OUR SEPARATE WAYS.

06:36.270 --> 06:38.064
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
YOUR OWN WAY?

06:38.147 --> 06:39.482
{\an8}LIKE, WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

06:39.565 --> 06:41.234
{\an8}- THAT'S IT. WE'RE COOL.
WE'RE ROOMMATES. WHATEVER.

06:41.317 --> 06:42.610
{\an8}DON'T WORRY ABOUT WHAT I DO.

06:42.693 --> 06:44.153
{\an8}- I'M NOT WORRYING
ABOUT WHAT YOU DO.

06:44.237 --> 06:47.073
{\an8}- LAST NIGHT YOU WERE, LIKE--
YOU WERE ALL UP IN MY BUSINESS.

06:47.156 --> 06:48.366
{\an8}- BUT I GOT DRUNK.

06:48.449 --> 06:50.076
{\an8}AND I'M TELLING YOU AS A PERSON
I DON'T REMEMBER.

06:50.159 --> 06:51.452
{\an8}- I APPRECIATE THE APOLOGY.
THAT'S REAL.

06:51.536 --> 06:52.620
{\an8}IT TAKES A LOT TO DO THAT.

06:52.703 --> 06:54.205
{\an8}SO JUST DO WHATEVER YOU CAME
HERE TO DO.

06:54.288 --> 06:55.498
{\an8}I'M GONNA DO
WHAT I CAME HERE TO DO.

06:55.581 --> 06:58.167
{\an8}- WHAT DID YOU COME HERE TO DO?
- HAVE FUN.

06:58.251 --> 07:00.253
{\an8}- AND I WANT TO HAVE FUN.
- OKAY, WELL, HAVE FUN.

07:00.336 --> 07:02.046
{\an8}BUT, UNFORTUNATELY, YOUR FUN
CONFLICTS WITH OUR FUN.

07:02.130 --> 07:03.339
{\an8}SO DO IT ON YOUR OWN.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.258
{\an8}- WHAT DID I DO TO YOU GUYS?

07:05.341 --> 07:06.843
{\an8}- DO YOU WANT ME
TO RECAP THE NIGHT?

07:06.926 --> 07:09.011
{\an8}- LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO RECAP
THE NIGHT, THAT'S FINE,

07:09.095 --> 07:09.929
{\an8}BECAUSE I DON'T REMEMBER IT.

07:10.012 --> 07:11.639
{\an8}- YOU APOLOGIZED,
WHICH IS FINE.

07:11.722 --> 07:12.515
{\an8}SO THAT--I'LL REMAIN--
I'LL BE COOL WITH YOU,

07:12.598 --> 07:14.433
{\an8}'CAUSE I'M NOT AN [bleep].

07:14.517 --> 07:16.018
{\an8}I DON'T GET MAD.
BUT I'LL BE COOL WITH YOU.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.353
{\an8}JUST DO YOU.

07:17.436 --> 07:18.729
{\an8}- DO I GET, LIKE--
DO I GET, LIKE,

07:18.813 --> 07:21.524
{\an8}A "GET OUT OF JAIL FREE" CARD
OR SOMETHING?

07:21.607 --> 07:23.234
{\an8}'CAUSE I DIDN'T KNOW
THAT BEING DRUNK

07:23.317 --> 07:25.027
{\an8}AND PEOPLE MAKING MISTAKES
IS THAT BAD.

07:25.111 --> 07:26.028
{\an8}- WHAT DO YOU WANT ME TO DO?

07:26.112 --> 07:27.363
{\an8}YOU [bleep] SLAPPED ME
IN THE FACE.

07:27.446 --> 07:28.906
{\an8}- BUT I'M SAYING I'M SORRY
TO YOU.

07:28.990 --> 07:30.825
{\an8}- OKAY, I TAKE THE APOLOGY,
BUT THAT'S IT.

07:30.908 --> 07:32.743
{\an8}LET'S LEAVE IT AT THAT.

07:39.542 --> 07:42.044
{\an8}- IT'S JUST SO HARD.

07:42.128 --> 07:43.754
{\an8}I DIDN'T THINK
IT WAS GONNA BE THIS BAD

07:43.838 --> 07:46.007
{\an8}COMING IN TO THE HOUSE.

07:46.090 --> 07:47.717
{\an8}[sniffles]

07:50.678 --> 07:52.430
{\an8}- I KIND OF FEEL BAD
FOR ANGELINA,

07:52.513 --> 07:53.806
{\an8}BECAUSE I WAS IN HER SPOT.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.725
{\an8}YOU NEED TO ADMIT TO EVERYBODY
THAT YOU TALK [bleep],

07:55.808 --> 07:58.186
{\an8}AND THEN WE'LL BRING YOU IN.
- I'M NOT.

07:58.269 --> 08:01.105
{\an8}- RONNIE, WHEN HE'S DRUNK,

08:01.189 --> 08:02.815
{\an8}IS LIKE
A DIFFERENT PERSON LATELY.

08:02.899 --> 08:04.066
{\an8}HE'S JUST A MESS.

08:04.150 --> 08:06.569
{\an8}[laughter]

08:06.652 --> 08:09.697
{\an8}- COME ON.

08:14.994 --> 08:19.457
{\an8}- I REALLY NEED A HAIRCUT BAD.
LIKE, WOW.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.210
{\an8}I HAVEN'T HAD A GOOD HAIRCUT
SINCE I GOT HERE.

08:22.293 --> 08:23.419
{\an8}I HAVE THICK,
THICK SICILIAN HAIR,

08:23.502 --> 08:25.421
{\an8}AND THE ONLY THING
I CAN DO WITH IT

08:25.504 --> 08:27.381
{\an8}IS GET A TAPE-UP AND A FADE.

08:27.465 --> 08:29.217
{\an8}IF I DON'T HAVE THAT,
THAT'S LIKE SAYING,

08:29.300 --> 08:30.801
{\an8}"YOU HAVE TO GO OUT
WITHOUT PUTTING GEL

08:30.885 --> 08:31.427
{\an8}IN YOUR HAIR."

08:31.510 --> 08:33.261
{\an8}HOW YOU DOING, MAN?

08:33.346 --> 08:35.264
{\an8}UM, YOU HAVE TO--YOU HAVE
TO MAKE AN APPOINTMENT,

08:35.347 --> 08:36.599
{\an8}OR YOU TAKE WALK-INS?

08:36.682 --> 08:38.267
{\an8}I'M NEW IN TOWN. I'M SORRY.
I'M FROM NEW YORK.

08:38.351 --> 08:39.727
{\an8}SO I NEED, LIKE,
A GOOD TAPE-UP.

08:39.809 --> 08:42.897
{\an8}- AND SHAPE-UP.
LET'S GO DO THIS, BRUTUS.

08:42.980 --> 08:45.441
{\an8}- SO ME AND RONNIE
GO TO THIS NEW BARBER SHOP--

08:45.524 --> 08:48.486
{\an8}A LITTLE BIT OF A HOOD
BARBER SHOP.

08:48.569 --> 08:49.946
{\an8}IF SOMEONE CAN CUT
A BLACK PERSON'S HAIR,

08:50.029 --> 08:51.155
{\an8}THEY CAN USUALLY CUT
MY HAIR.

08:51.239 --> 08:53.449
{\an8}WE ARE IN THE HOOD OF MIAMI
RIGHT NOW.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.284
{\an8}- THIS IS...
- YOU EVER HEAR--

08:55.368 --> 08:56.369
{\an8}YOU EVER SEE <i> BAD BOYS II</i>
WITH THE HAITIANS?

08:56.452 --> 08:58.663
{\an8}I FEEL LIKE...
[mimics fanfare]

08:58.746 --> 09:00.706
{\an8}LIKE THEY'RE ALL GONNA COME OUT
OF THE BUSHES.

09:00.790 --> 09:02.625
{\an8}- THEY'RE LETTING
THE PIGEONS GO RIGHT NOW.

09:02.708 --> 09:03.960
{\an8}- FLIPPING PIGEONS.
- SEE? SEE?

09:04.043 --> 09:07.838
{\an8}- FLIPPING PIGEONS. THAT MEANS
WHITE BOYS ARE IN THE HOOD.

09:07.922 --> 09:09.799
{\an8}- [chuckles]

09:12.510 --> 09:14.136
{\an8}I'M VERY ANAL ABOUT MY HAIR,
LIKE, YOU KNOW?

09:14.220 --> 09:15.471
{\an8}I'M, LIKE, NERVOUS.

09:15.554 --> 09:18.182
{\an8}SO I'M PRAYING THAT THEY KNOW
WHAT THEY'RE DOING.

09:18.266 --> 09:22.103
{\an8}[razor buzzes]
- YO.

09:30.653 --> 09:32.697
{\an8}- THANK GOD. GOOD JOB.

09:32.780 --> 09:34.991
{\an8}- REAL HAIRCUT,
LIKE NEW YORK CITY, BABY.

09:35.074 --> 09:37.076
{\an8}FINALLY THE HEAVENS
HAVE ANSWERED,

09:37.159 --> 09:38.619
{\an8}AND I FOUND A BARBER SHOP
IN MIAMI.

09:38.703 --> 09:41.664
{\an8}STRAIGHT EDGE AND EVERYTHING.
- THANK GOD.

09:41.747 --> 09:43.791
{\an8}- TOLD YOU I NEEDED TO COME
TO THE HOOD TO GET A HAIRCUT.

09:43.874 --> 09:45.001
{\an8}[laughter]

09:45.084 --> 09:48.504
{\an8}AS YOU CAN SEE,
GOT A GOOD FADE GOING ON.

09:48.587 --> 09:50.673
{\an8}I MEAN, THEY KNOW HOW TO DO IT
IN THE HOOD.

09:50.756 --> 09:53.092
{\an8}ding!

09:54.593 --> 09:56.512
{\an8}- HOW'S WORK?
- NOT EVEN THAT BAD.

09:56.596 --> 09:57.888
{\an8}COME HERE.
GIVE ME A KISS.

09:57.972 --> 10:00.850
{\an8}[laughs]

10:00.933 --> 10:04.020
{\an8}- THINGS ARE GOING REALLY GOOD
WITH ME AND RONNIE.

10:04.103 --> 10:05.688
{\an8}I THINK WE'RE SINGLE
RIGHT NOW, I GUESS.

10:05.771 --> 10:06.564
{\an8}I DON'T KNOW.
WE'RE WORKING ON THINGS.

10:06.647 --> 10:08.399
{\an8}BUT I FEEL LIKE
HE'S SHOWING ME

10:08.482 --> 10:11.027
{\an8}THAT HE'S TRYING
TO MAKE THIS WORK.

10:11.110 --> 10:15.114
{\an8}AND I'M LOVING IT
RIGHT NOW.

10:17.783 --> 10:19.535
{\an8}- ANGE, YOU ALL RIGHT?

10:19.618 --> 10:23.748
{\an8}- NO.
I JUST DON'T FEEL GOOD.

10:23.831 --> 10:26.792
{\an8}- I'M ACTUALLY STARTING
TO FEEL BAD FOR ANGELINA.

10:26.876 --> 10:29.086
{\an8}I MEAN, SOME OF THE [bleep]
SHE'S DONE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS,

10:29.170 --> 10:30.671
{\an8}IT'S JUST NOT COOL STUFF.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.049
{\an8}BUT AT THE SAME TIME, I'M GONNA
PUT MY BEST FOOT FORWARD.

10:33.132 --> 10:34.884
{\an8}UM, I DO KNOW ANGELINA BEFORE,

10:34.967 --> 10:36.093
{\an8}AND I KNOW SHE HASN'T
BEEN ACTING LIKE HERSELF.

10:36.177 --> 10:39.472
{\an8}SO I WANTED TO MAKE IT A POINT
TO TALK TO EVERYBODY

10:39.555 --> 10:40.890
{\an8}ABOUT THE WHOLE SITUATION.

10:40.973 --> 10:42.516
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE'RE ALL GONNA
BE HERE FOR A LITTLE BIT.

10:42.600 --> 10:44.435
{\an8}SO, YOU KNOW, WE'RE GONNA HAVE
TO WORK OUT SOMETHING

10:44.518 --> 10:45.728
{\an8}IN THE HOUSE.

10:45.811 --> 10:47.313
{\an8}THE ONLY WAY,
AT THE END OF THE DAY,

10:47.396 --> 10:50.399
{\an8}FOR THIS TO WORK IS FOR HER
TO BOND WITH THE GIRLS.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.735
{\an8}- SERIOUS?
- WHY?

10:52.818 --> 10:53.611
{\an8}- BECAUSE HOW ARE ME AND HIM
GONNA DO OUR THING?

10:53.694 --> 10:54.653
{\an8}- SHE DOESN'T FIT IN WITH US.

10:54.737 --> 10:56.739
{\an8}- SHE DOESN'T FIT IN
WITH ME AND HIM.

10:56.822 --> 10:58.366
{\an8}- COME ON.
- SHE HAS TO BE WITH YOU.

10:58.449 --> 11:01.285
{\an8}OR SHE HAS TO BE SAM
OR SNOOKS OR WHATEVER,

11:01.369 --> 11:03.412
{\an8}'CAUSE THERE'S NO WAY
SHE'S GONNA GO TO THE GYM

11:03.496 --> 11:05.664
{\an8}EVERY DAY WITH ME AND PAULY.

11:05.748 --> 11:06.916
{\an8}SHE'S NOT GONNA DO GTL

11:06.999 --> 11:08.876
{\an8}AND THEN GO TO THE HAIRCUT
AND SIT AT THE HAIRCUT.

11:08.959 --> 11:10.169
{\an8}- SHE'S GONNA NEED TO GET
HER NAILS DONE AND [bleep].

11:10.252 --> 11:11.921
{\an8}- YEAH, SO YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN?
I'M JUST TRYING TO SAY

11:12.004 --> 11:14.840
{\an8}THAT, LIKE, THE WHOLE
BULL[bleep] BEFORE ALL THIS,

11:14.924 --> 11:15.925
{\an8}WE SHOULD PUSH THAT ASIDE.

11:16.008 --> 11:20.805
{\an8}- ALL I WANT FROM THAT GIRL
IS TO MAN UP

11:20.888 --> 11:22.390
{\an8}AND SAY THE TRUTH
ABOUT TALKING [bleep].

11:22.473 --> 11:23.974
{\an8}- I'M TELLING YOU
THAT YOU'RE GONNA BE LIVING

11:24.058 --> 11:24.600
{\an8}IN THE SAME HOUSE
FOR TWO MONTHS.

11:24.683 --> 11:26.602
{\an8}THIS IS A NEW SLATE.

11:26.685 --> 11:28.521
{\an8}WE SHOULD TAKE HER UPON THE WAY
THAT SHE ACTS NOW

11:28.604 --> 11:31.190
{\an8}AND NOT PAST [bleep].

11:34.360 --> 11:35.986
{\an8}ANGE?
- HMM?

11:36.070 --> 11:38.948
{\an8}EVERYBODY'S, UH, GONNA GO OUT,
IF YOU WANT TO COME OUT.

11:39.031 --> 11:41.659
{\an8}- YOU'RE ACTUALLY INVITING ME
TO COME OUT WITH YOU?

11:41.742 --> 11:44.161
{\an8}- YEAH.
- ALL RIGHT. THANK YOU.

11:44.245 --> 11:49.166
{\an8}- NO PROBLEM.

11:49.250 --> 11:51.669
{\an8}- I'M DOING THE POOF TONIGHT.

11:51.752 --> 11:52.128
{\an8}- GOES RIGHT
WITH THE CHEETAH LOOK.

11:52.211 --> 11:55.172
{\an8}- REALLY?

11:55.256 --> 11:58.300
{\an8}- TONIGHT SNOOKI IS ROCKING
THE OLD SNOOK LOOK--

11:58.384 --> 12:00.344
{\an8}LEOPARD DRESS, POOF,

12:00.428 --> 12:02.012
{\an8}AND SHE ACTUALLY LOOKS
PRETTY GOOD.

12:02.096 --> 12:04.223
{\an8}YOU LOOK HOT.
- REALLY?

12:04.306 --> 12:05.975
{\an8}- I'VE NEVER SAID THAT
TO YOU.

12:06.058 --> 12:08.269
{\an8}YOU JUST TOOK MY BREATH AWAY.

12:08.352 --> 12:09.645
{\an8}- YOU TRYING
TO SMOOSH RIGHT NOW?

12:09.728 --> 12:12.398
{\an8}- NO.
- YOU LOOK HOT TOO.

12:15.234 --> 12:16.569
{\an8}- [chuckles]
WHO KNOWS?

12:16.652 --> 12:18.571
{\an8}- ARE YOU READY?
- TAXIS ARE LEAVING.

12:18.654 --> 12:20.865
{\an8}- JENNI, YOU FORGOT YOUR SHIRT.
- [laughs]

12:20.948 --> 12:22.825
{\an8}- ♪ POP MAGIC,
GOT TO HAVE IT ♪

12:22.908 --> 12:24.827
{\an8}♪ SO ADDICTED, I'M A ADDICT ♪

12:24.910 --> 12:27.329
{\an8}♪ POP MAGIC, I'M A ADDICT ♪

12:27.413 --> 12:30.416
{\an8}♪ SO ADDICTED,
GOT TO HAVE IT ♪

12:30.499 --> 12:32.960
{\an8}- JENNI'S [bleep] DEFINITELY
DEFY GRAVITY.

12:33.043 --> 12:34.712
{\an8}THEY--I THINK ALBERT EINSTEIN
SHOULD COME BACK

12:34.795 --> 12:37.882
{\an8}AND REWRITE HIS LAWS
OF PHYSICS

12:37.965 --> 12:39.842
{\an8}AND WORK IT
AROUND JENNI'S [bleep].

12:44.763 --> 12:46.182
{\an8}- I'M STILL ANGRY
WITH ANGELINA.

12:46.265 --> 12:50.936
{\an8}BUT AT THE SAME TIME, LIKE,
I KIND OF FEEL BAD FOR THE GIRL.

12:51.020 --> 12:51.896
{\an8}SHE'S NOT TALKING TO ANYBODY.

12:51.979 --> 12:55.691
{\an8}AND I WAS IN HER SPOT
LAST SUMMER.

12:55.774 --> 12:57.526
{\an8}SO I KNOW WHAT'S GOING
THROUGH HER HEAD,

12:57.610 --> 13:00.154
{\an8}AND I THINK I JUST NEED
TO SAY SOMETHING TO HER.

13:25.971 --> 13:27.556
{\an8}- THANK YOU! THANK YOU!

13:27.640 --> 13:30.100
{\an8}ALL HAIL ANGELINA RIGHT NOW!

13:30.184 --> 13:34.230
{\an8}SHE TALKED [bleep] ABOUT ME,
AND SHE'S ADMITTING IT FOR ONCE!

13:34.313 --> 13:35.898
{\an8}- I AM.
- THANK YOU. THANK YOU.

13:35.981 --> 13:39.026
{\an8}'CAUSE I FEEL YOUR PAIN.
THANK YOU.

13:39.109 --> 13:40.861
{\an8}- I FEEL LIKE EVERYONE TALKS
[bleep] IN THIS HOUSE.

13:40.945 --> 13:42.905
{\an8}BUT I FELT LIKE I SHOULD BE
THE BIGGER PERSON,

13:42.988 --> 13:46.075
{\an8}AND I WOULD JUST ACCEPT
THE FACT THAT I WAS WRONG

13:46.158 --> 13:48.202
{\an8}AND SQUASH ANY KIND
OF PROBLEMS.

13:48.285 --> 13:50.496
{\an8}SO I JUST BASICALLY SAID,
"I'M SORRY"

13:50.579 --> 13:54.250
{\an8}JUST TO BASICALLY END
ALL THIS.

13:54.333 --> 13:57.419
{\an8}- ADMIT IT ALL.

13:57.503 --> 14:01.090
{\an8}ANGELINA,
THAT'S ALL YOU HAVE TO SAY.

14:01.173 --> 14:02.591
{\an8}- I HAVE TO GIVE ANGELINA
A LOT OF CREDIT

14:02.675 --> 14:04.093
{\an8}FOR APOLOGIZING TO ME.

14:04.176 --> 14:05.970
{\an8}SHE CAME CLEAN ABOUT EVERYTHING
THAT SHE SAID.

14:06.053 --> 14:08.597
{\an8}SO I'M, LIKE, "ALL RIGHT,
I'LL ACCEPT THE APOLOGY

14:08.681 --> 14:11.100
{\an8}AND, UH, GO FROM THERE."

14:17.106 --> 14:18.566
{\an8}- I DON'T EVEN WANT
TO DO THAT EITHER.

14:25.030 --> 14:27.950
{\an8}- I WAS HAVING THE TIME
OF MY LIFE WITH RON.

14:28.033 --> 14:29.994
{\an8}WE'RE DANCING, PARTYING.

14:30.077 --> 14:31.745
{\an8}WE'RE HAVING ANOTHER AMAZING
NIGHT OUT.

14:31.829 --> 14:34.164
{\an8}NEXT THING YOU KNOW,
I LOOK OVER...

14:34.248 --> 14:35.499
{\an8}[cymbal crashes]

14:35.583 --> 14:36.709
{\an8}AND RON'S [bleep] FACE
WASTED.

14:36.792 --> 14:42.464
{\an8}I JUST DON'T APPRECIATE THAT.

14:42.548 --> 14:44.049
{\an8}- RONNIE, WHEN HE'S DRUNK,

14:44.133 --> 14:45.718
{\an8}IS LIKE
A DIFFERENT PERSON LATELY.

14:45.801 --> 14:47.386
{\an8}HE'S CRAZY.

14:47.469 --> 14:50.723
{\an8}HE'S--HE'S--HE'S JUST NUTS
WHEN HE'S BEEN DRUNK LATELY.

15:21.045 --> 15:22.838
{\an8}- IT REALLY FELT LIKE
AT THAT MOMENT, LIKE,

15:22.921 --> 15:24.089
{\an8}THAT WAS THE END OF SAM
AND RON.

15:28.636 --> 15:29.762
{\an8}- OH, MY GOD.

15:29.845 --> 15:32.348
{\an8}I SEE RON WITH ANOTHER GIRL.

15:32.431 --> 15:33.599
{\an8}YOU NEED TO HAVE A LINE.

15:33.682 --> 15:35.351
{\an8}- GO.
- RONNIE PUSHES SNOOKI.

15:35.434 --> 15:36.518
{\an8}WE HAD TO STEP IN
RIGHT THEN AND THERE.

15:36.602 --> 15:40.522
{\an8}- JUST STAY WITH ME.
DID I DO THE UNTHINKABLE?

15:40.606 --> 15:43.984
{\an8}- NICOLE'S IN BED
WITH VINNY.

15:47.780 --> 15:49.782
{\an8}- IF YOU'RE GONNA SIT HERE
AND ACT THE WAY YOU'RE ACTING,

15:49.865 --> 15:50.949
{\an8}THEN GO.

15:51.033 --> 15:53.744
{\an8}YOU'RE A [bleep] BITCH. GO.

16:01.460 --> 16:05.214
{\an8}- I COULDN'T BELIEVE RON,
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE CLUB--

16:05.297 --> 16:07.007
{\an8}IN, LIKE, THE MIDDLE
OF ALL OUR ROOMMATES--

16:07.091 --> 16:08.884
{\an8}WOULD SCREAM AT ME
AND GO, "YOU'RE A BITCH.

16:08.967 --> 16:10.219
{\an8}YOU'RE MISERABLE."

16:10.302 --> 16:11.553
{\an8}WHEN I HEARD THAT,
I JUST BROKE DOWN EMOTIONALLY,

16:11.637 --> 16:14.390

34:24.312 --> 34:26.313
{\an8}YOU ARE NOT SPOONING
CORRECTLY, SNOOKI.

34:26.397 --> 34:27.648
{\an8}- AH.
- WHAT?

34:27.732 --> 34:29.567
{\an8}- IT WAS THIS SIDE,
NOT THAT SIDE.

34:29.650 --> 34:30.610
{\an8}- UGH!

34:30.693 --> 34:33.987
{\an8}- IF I STAND OUTSIDE
WITH MY SHIRT OFF,

34:34.071 --> 34:35.489
{\an8}THERE'D PROBABLY BE
A SITUATION OUT THERE.

34:35.572 --> 34:36.532
{\an8}THERE'D BE, LIKE, A WHOLE CROWD
OF PEOPLE OUT THERE.

34:36.616 --> 34:38.701
{\an8}GUARANTEE IT.

34:38.784 --> 34:41.245
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO FLAG SOME CUSTOMERS
IN HERE FOR YOU.

34:41.329 --> 34:43.623
{\an8}THE GELATO SPOT
WAS A LITTLE SLOW.

34:43.706 --> 34:45.166
{\an8}SO I'M GONNA JUST STEP UP
A LITTLE BIT.

34:45.248 --> 34:46.125
{\an8}I'M GONNA STAND RIGHT
IN FRONT OF THE STORE,

34:46.208 --> 34:48.795
{\an8}SHIRT OFF,
BRING IN THE CLIENTS,

34:48.878 --> 34:53.674
{\an8}THE CUSTOMERS, THE WOMEN,
BABIES, DOGS, EVERYBODY.

34:53.757 --> 34:55.802
{\an8}YOU GUYS CAN COME AND GET
SOME ICE CREAMS INSIDE.

34:55.885 --> 34:57.178
{\an8}GUYS WANT SOME ICE CREAM?

34:57.261 --> 35:01.182
{\an8}YOU GUYS--ALL RIGHT, DOG,
COME GET SOME ICE CREAM.

35:01.265 --> 35:04.060
{\an8}HI, GIRLS.

35:04.143 --> 35:06.479
{\an8}- I DON'T THINK
MIKE CAN GO A DAY

35:06.562 --> 35:07.855
{\an8}WITHOUT TAKING HIS SHIRT OFF.

35:07.939 --> 35:09.899
{\an8}HE LOOKS LIKE A FRICKIN'
DIRTY OLD MAN

35:09.982 --> 35:11.359
{\an8}OUTSIDE WITH HIS SHIRT OFF

35:11.442 --> 35:12.610
{\an8}AT AN ICE CREAM SHOP.

35:12.693 --> 35:13.903
{\an8}WHERE'S THE CUSTOMERS?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.279
{\an8}- [laughs]

35:28.251 --> 35:31.212
{\an8}- WORK IS SO DEAD.
LIKE, TIME IS DRAGGING.

35:31.295 --> 35:33.339
{\an8}AND I JUST DON'T WANT
TO BE THERE.

35:33.422 --> 35:37.635
{\an8}AND I JUST NEED
SOMETHING TO DO.

35:37.718 --> 35:38.719
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO GET
ON THE CAMEL?

35:38.803 --> 35:40.930
{\an8}- HA HA HA.
I THOUGHT IT WAS A DOG.

35:41.013 --> 35:43.850
{\an8}- I'M GONNA PUT YOU ON THERE.

35:43.933 --> 35:46.978
{\an8}- AAH! AAH! WAIT.

35:47.061 --> 35:48.104
{\an8}- YOU GOT TO HOLD ON
TO THE EARS.

35:48.187 --> 35:49.272
{\an8}- YEAH.
- HOLD ON TO THE EARS.

35:49.355 --> 35:51.065
{\an8}- OH, IT HURTS MY VAGINA.
OH. [laughs]

35:51.148 --> 35:51.566
{\an8}- ALL RIGHT, COME ON.
YOU WANT TO GET DOWN?

35:51.649 --> 35:54.277
{\an8}- NO, I LIKE IT.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.904
{\an8}- IF WE'RE GOING OUT,
WE WANT TO GET READY.

35:56.988 --> 35:58.155
{\an8}- YOU WANT TO GO BACK
TO KLUTCH?

35:58.239 --> 35:59.907
{\an8}THERE WERE GOOD-LOOKING
GIRLS THERE.

35:59.991 --> 36:03.035
{\an8}- I'D GO BACK TO KLUTCH.
- PAULY WANTS TO GET IT IN.

36:05.163 --> 36:06.539
{\an8}- WHERE'S RONNIE?
IS HE GOING OUT?

36:06.622 --> 36:09.917
{\an8}- ARE YOU GOING, RON?
- I'M SO COMFORTABLE RIGHT NOW.

36:10.001 --> 36:12.920
{\an8}- TONIGHT I'M JUST TIRED.

36:13.004 --> 36:14.380
{\an8}I DON'T WANT TO GO OUT,
SO I KIND OF WAS EXCITED

36:14.463 --> 36:16.924
{\an8}THAT RON WAS LIKE,
"OH, I'LL STAY HOME WITH YOU."

36:17.008 --> 36:18.259
{\an8}AND I WAS LIKE,
"OH, WE CAN CUDDLE

36:18.342 --> 36:20.011
{\an8}AND, LIKE, HAVE A GOOD TIME,
LIKE, WHATEVER."

36:20.094 --> 36:22.221
{\an8}- YOU GONNA GO OUT?
- NO. WHERE YOU GOING?

36:22.305 --> 36:25.141
{\an8}- ME AND JENNI
ARE GONNA GO ON A DATE.

36:25.224 --> 36:29.270
{\an8}GO GET FOOD OR SOMETHING,
JUST CHILL.

36:29.353 --> 36:30.771
{\an8}- WANT TO GO WITH THE GIRLS?

36:30.855 --> 36:32.648
{\an8}THEN, YOU KNOW, I'M GONNA GO TO
KLUTCH WITH THE GUYS.

36:32.732 --> 36:34.025
{\an8}- WHAT?

36:34.108 --> 36:35.276
{\an8}- IF YOU WANT TO GO
WITH SNOOKI AND JENNI,

36:35.359 --> 36:36.235
{\an8}I WANT TO GO TO KLUTCH
WITH THE GUYS.

36:43.910 --> 36:47.663
{\an8}I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

36:47.747 --> 36:50.625
{\an8}- I CAN'T BELIEVE RON IS ABOUT
TO GO OUT WITH THE GUYS.

36:50.708 --> 36:51.667
{\an8}LIKE, HE KNEW
I WAS STAYING HOME.

36:51.751 --> 36:53.878
{\an8}AND ON TOP OF IT,
LIKE, WHEN THE ROOMMATES

36:53.961 --> 36:54.962
{\an8}GO OUT TO A CLUB,

36:55.046 --> 36:56.797
{\an8}ALL THEY WANT TO DO
IS GO LOOK FOR GIRLS.

36:56.881 --> 36:58.382
{\an8}- IT'S 12:14!

36:58.466 --> 37:00.092
{\an8}- ARE YOU GUYS GOING TO KLUTCH?
- YEAH.

37:00.176 --> 37:01.886
{\an8}- WHAT TIME YOU GUYS LEAVING?
NOW?

37:01.969 --> 37:07.141
{\an8}- WHY? WE WAITING FOR YOU?

37:07.224 --> 37:10.061
{\an8}DOG, JUST COME OUT.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

37:12.230 --> 37:15.608
{\an8}- IF HE GOES OUT WITH THEM,
I WILL BE REALLY PISSED OFF.

37:26.118 --> 37:28.412
{\an8}- WHAT TIME YOU GUYS LEAVING?
NOW?

37:28.496 --> 37:30.790
{\an8}- WHY? WE WAITING FOR YOU?

37:30.873 --> 37:32.959
{\an8}DOG, JUST COME OUT.
IT'LL BE ALL RIGHT.

37:33.042 --> 37:36.587
{\an8}YO. COME ON.
- RONNIE, COME ON, BRO.

37:36.671 --> 37:38.172
{\an8}- I LOVE SPENDING TIME
WITH SAM.

37:38.255 --> 37:40.341
{\an8}BUT I'M IN MIAMI
WITH MY--MY BOYS.

37:40.424 --> 37:41.676
{\an8}I'M GONNA GO OUT.

37:41.759 --> 37:45.638
{\an8}BABY GIRL, I'M GONNA GO OUT
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

37:48.891 --> 37:52.603
{\an8}YOU HEARD?

37:52.687 --> 37:54.188
{\an8}HELLO?
- WHAT?

37:54.271 --> 37:57.316
{\an8}- I'M GONNA GO
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

37:57.400 --> 37:59.568
{\an8}- I WAS A LITTLE TAKEN BACK
WHEN HE WAS LIKE, "PEACE.

37:59.652 --> 38:01.195
{\an8}I'M GOING OUT WITH MY BOYS."

38:01.278 --> 38:02.947
{\an8}I'M USED TO ALWAYS BEING
WITH RON

38:03.030 --> 38:04.865
{\an8}AND HANGING OUT AND, LIKE,
SPENDING TIME WITH HIM.

38:04.949 --> 38:06.867
{\an8}AND I'M NOT USED TO HIM
GOING OUT WITH THE GUYS

38:06.951 --> 38:08.035
{\an8}AND DOING HIS OWN THING.

38:08.119 --> 38:11.455
{\an8}- WHAT ARE YOU GONNA DO?

38:11.539 --> 38:14.709
{\an8}WHY DON'T YOU GO
WITH JENNI AND SNOOKI?

38:14.792 --> 38:17.253
{\an8}GIVE ME A KISS.

38:17.336 --> 38:21.298
{\an8}WHAT? WHAT'D YOU SAY?
[smooching]

38:24.760 --> 38:29.181
{\an8}DID I DO SOMETHING TO YOU?
I DON'T GET IT.

38:29.265 --> 38:30.808
{\an8}THERE'S ONLY SO MUCH TIME,
YOU KNOW,

38:30.891 --> 38:31.976
{\an8}THAT WE CAN SPEND
TOGETHER HERE.

38:32.059 --> 38:35.229
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT
TO ALIENATE OURSELVES.

38:35.312 --> 38:37.023
{\an8}YOU KNOW, WE DON'T WANT TO FEEL,
LIKE, YOU KNOW,

38:37.106 --> 38:38.232
{\an8}LIKE WE'RE ONLY HANGING OUT
WITH EACH OTHER.

38:38.315 --> 38:40.484
{\an8}WE WANT TO HANG OUT
WITH EVERYONE.

38:42.361 --> 38:43.571
{\an8}- YOU SHOULD COME OUT
WITH US.

38:48.617 --> 38:49.535
{\an8}- YOU TOLD HIM HE CAN GO.

38:49.618 --> 38:51.996
{\an8}- I DIDN'T THINK
HE ACTUALLY WOULD.

38:52.079 --> 38:53.330
{\an8}- THAT WAS A TEST,
YOU JERK-OFF.

38:53.414 --> 38:56.375
{\an8}- I TESTED HIM,
AND HE FAILED.

38:59.045 --> 39:00.421
{\an8}- COME ON. LET'S GO.

39:00.504 --> 39:03.466
{\an8}- THAT JUST WAS, LIKE,
A SLAP IN MY FACE.

39:03.549 --> 39:06.427
