Oh yeah yeah I was just
having a look around.

24:51.526 --> 24:54.124
It should be locked
up, gotta be careful,

24:54.126 --> 24:56.925
you get squatters
in places like that.

24:56.927 --> 25:01.691
Oh no no I was just inside,
there's someone there, a nun.

25:01.693 --> 25:02.361
A nun?

25:03.761 --> 25:05.493
It isn't a working church.

25:07.828 --> 25:11.025
- Well it's open, I saw her.
- You went inside?

25:11.027 --> 25:11.895
Yeah.

25:19.896 --> 25:22.660
Oh God I'm so cold
it's freezing out here.

You look like you
need a coffee, come on.

25:24.662 --> 25:25.727
How do you take it?

25:25.729 --> 25:27.526
[AESHA] Oh don't
worry I'll do it,

25:27.528 --> 25:29.294
you sit down, I'll get it.

25:29.296 --> 25:32.793
- How do you take yours?
- Black, one sugar please.

25:32.795 --> 25:33.662
Sure thing.

25:52.831 --> 25:55.795
So uhm, do you have
WiFi by any chance?

25:55.797 --> 25:57.898
First question
I'm always asked.

25:59.197 --> 26:03.528
Yes we do, on the landing
there's a do's and don'ts form.

26:03.530 --> 26:05.662
The WiFi is at the bottom.

26:05.664 --> 26:09.430
It does get a bit weaker
at point, so bear with it.

26:10.732 --> 26:13.296
So how long have you
lived here then, my mom said

26:13.298 --> 26:16.696
something about it being recently
converted, is that right?

26:16.698 --> 26:20.529
Yes that's right, it
used to be my mother's.

26:20.531 --> 26:22.997
It was her convent that
had been in the family

26:22.999 --> 26:25.997
for generations and generations,

26:25.999 --> 26:27.697
that the nuns would
live here, (MUMBLING),

26:27.699 --> 26:30.032

across the road.

26:31.833 --> 26:34.065
So you're not religious then?

26:35.900 --> 26:39.064
Well I just mean with, so
are you, you changing it into

26:39.066 --> 26:40.964
a modern farm.

26:40.966 --> 26:44.798
I see, no, not overly
religious myself.

26:44.800 --> 26:47.298
My mom was before
she passed away.

stop by thinking it to be

26:52.268 --> 26:53.133

26:54.600 --> 26:56.134
Well, must get
really annoying.

27:00.667 --> 27:05.699
I was wondering if it
would at all be possible

27:05.701 --> 27:09.134
that you could maybe
look after my daughter?

27:10.768 --> 27:14.100
She is in her room,
completely full of cold.

27:14.102 --> 27:17.066
It wouldn't be like
a babysitting job.

27:17.068 --> 27:18.133
I mean she is sick.

27:18.135 --> 27:21.200
Oh yeah yeah Dan
that's fine, sure.

27:21.202 --> 27:23.933
She will most likely stay
in home most of the night.

around your house.

wasn't a stranger at all.

And he's upstairs, in your
