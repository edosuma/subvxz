00:06.834 --> 00:08.200
Congratulations.

00:08.200 --> 00:09.300
Baby, this restaurant

00:09.300 --> 00:12.000
is everything
we ever dreamed of.

00:12.000 --> 00:13.867
And the best part is,
this is my place.

00:13.867 --> 00:15.600
I mean, finally, I'm the boss

00:15.600 --> 00:17.700
and nobody can
tell me what to do.

00:17.700 --> 00:18.700
Yeah, that's
sweet, Dad.

00:18.700 --> 00:20.000
Hey, yeah,
get back to work.

00:20.000 --> 00:22.100
Uh... Rae,

00:22.100 --> 00:24.200
I know you're excited
about the opening and all,

00:24.200 --> 00:26.467
but let me explain
to you how it works
at The Chill Grill.

00:26.467 --> 00:27.700
I grill.

00:27.700 --> 00:30.100
You chill.

00:30.100 --> 00:31.200

00:48.834 --> 00:51.400
(<i>trills </i>)

00:51.400 --> 00:52.567
That's cute.

00:52.567 --> 00:55.400
But what if someone
actually heard you?

00:55.400 --> 00:57.400
I mean, you know, there's
going to be a lot of kids

00:57.400 --> 00:59.300
from our school hanging
around The Chill Grill.

00:59.300 --> 01:00.967
Excuse you.

01:00.967 --> 01:02.000
Just doing a sound check.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.200

we're going to have

opening night.

01:04.867 --> 01:05.867
We are?!

01:05.867 --> 01:07.767
Mom, when was this decided?

01:07.767 --> 01:08.834
Oh, excuse me.

01:08.834 --> 01:09.934
People, people,

01:09.934 --> 01:11.300
people, listen up,

01:11.300 --> 01:12.600
people, okay...

01:12.600 --> 01:16.300
This place has to be cool,
because, as we all know,

01:16.300 --> 01:20.500
it is a reflection upon me.

01:22.767 --> 01:26.600
So, the following things
are uncool:

01:26.600 --> 01:27.667
Mom scatting--

01:27.667 --> 01:29.600
yeah, that's got to go.

01:34.133 --> 01:38.100
Dad's face on these flyers.

01:40.033 --> 01:41.467

01:41.467 --> 01:44.567

the word, Dad.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.567

01:48.667 --> 01:50.233
gotta go.

01:50.233 --> 01:53.000
You know what, actually,
make Corey number one.

01:53.000 --> 01:54.133
So, starting
from the top...

01:54.133 --> 01:55.467
Man, Rae is
really tripping

01:55.467 --> 01:57.033
on this whole
restaurant thing.

01:57.033 --> 01:58.700
I know, she has
to control everything.

01:58.700 --> 02:00.834
Which is exactly why
we can't tell her
what we're doing.

You're going
to sprain something.

Yep, that's me.

03:21.934 --> 03:23.900
Come to the grand opening
of The Chill Grill.

03:23.900 --> 03:28.033
Cool food, cool people,
cool bathrooms.

03:28.033 --> 03:29.967
Well, actually, they're not
really that cool.

03:29.967 --> 03:31.033
They're just super clean.

But I guess you can say
that's cool.

03:36.200 --> 03:37.600
Hey, how you doing?

03:37.600 --> 03:38.667
Hey, what's up, Raven?

03:38.667 --> 03:41.200
Um, did I give you
one of these?

03:41.200 --> 03:44.100
Only a hundred.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.767
But, uh, I can always
use another one.

03:48.367 --> 03:49.934
That's a cute picture.

03:49.934 --> 03:51.300
Thanks.

03:51.300 --> 03:53.467
It was my dad's idea.

03:54.867 --> 03:57.000
Um, yeah, so do you
think you can make it?

03:57.000 --> 03:58.600
Are you guys going
to have egg rolls?

03:58.600 --> 04:01.934
It's not
a Chinese restaurant.

04:01.934 --> 04:04.567
That's too bad.
It's like all I eat.

04:04.567 --> 04:06.200
Wait, wait! Devon!

04:06.200 --> 04:08.467
Devon, get back here.

04:08.467 --> 04:10.100
I don't think
I heard you.

04:10.100 --> 04:11.567
Did you say,
"egg rolls"?

04:12.600 --> 04:14.867
Boy, of course
we got egg rolls.

04:14.867 --> 04:16.600
We are rolling
with the egg rolls.

04:16.600 --> 04:20.100
You better stop me,
I'm on the egg roll!

04:21.500 --> 04:23.233
Cool.
I'll try to make it.

04:23.233 --> 04:24.300
Okay.

04:24.300 --> 04:27.367
Bye, Devon-derfuliciousness.

04:28.500 --> 04:30.367
You guys, major news!

04:30.367 --> 04:31.767
Devon Carter said
he's going to try

04:31.767 --> 04:33.100
to make it
to the grand opening.

04:33.100 --> 04:34.233
Do you know what this means?

04:34.233 --> 04:36.400
Yeah. More work for us.

04:36.400 --> 04:37.600
Exactly.

04:37.600 --> 04:40.033
Chelsea, I'm going to need
a wardrobe conference.

04:40.033 --> 04:41.700
And, Eddie, I'm going to need
egg roll recipes.

04:41.700 --> 04:43.300
Okay, but what if
we have other plans?

we do have other plans.

05:00.667 --> 05:01.934
What y'all doing?

05:01.934 --> 05:04.300
We're bowling.
Surfing.

05:05.400 --> 05:07.000
Bowling.
Surfing.

05:07.000 --> 05:10.367
Actually, we were bowling
and surfing.

05:10.367 --> 05:11.400
Yeah, yeah, right.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.500
Right. We are blurfing.

05:14.900 --> 05:16.000
Yes.

05:16.000 --> 05:17.000
Blurfing?

05:17.000 --> 05:17.934
Mm-hmm.

05:17.934 --> 05:20.033
Yeah, see, uh...
see, you, uh...

05:20.033 --> 05:21.834
you bowl on a surfboard.

05:21.834 --> 05:24.000
And it's cool,
except for, you know,

05:24.000 --> 05:25.800
the, uh, the board
scratches the lanes.

05:25.800 --> 05:27.700
'Cause they're still
working out the kinks

05:27.700 --> 05:29.133
and stuff like that.

05:29.133 --> 05:30.767
So, um...

05:30.767 --> 05:34.000
y'all can't help out
'cause you got to blurf?

05:34.000 --> 05:35.767
Yeah, Rae, well, you know,
it's not us.

05:35.767 --> 05:37.200
We're in a league.
Sorry.

05:37.200 --> 05:38.400
And we better go.

05:53.467 --> 05:56.000
What's that?

05:56.000 --> 05:57.233
This is Monty.

05:57.233 --> 06:00.100
Isn't he cute
and not creepy at all?

06:01.000 --> 06:02.300
Corey's working on

06:02.300 --> 06:04.834
his "ventriloquist act"

06:04.834 --> 06:06.300

06:25.567 --> 06:27.867
Fine, but he rides
in the trunk.

06:27.867 --> 06:30.900
What's up with that?

06:32.834 --> 06:35.000
Hey, Dad,
I just have a question.

06:35.000 --> 06:37.500
Rae, I told you I'm not
putting egg rolls on the menu.

06:37.500 --> 06:38.567
Oh, come on, Dad.

06:38.567 --> 06:40.300
Egg rolls
are sweeping the nation.

06:40.300 --> 06:41.667
Four out of five kids surveyed

06:41.667 --> 06:43.233
said that
when it comes to rolls,

06:43.233 --> 06:45.400
egg is their favorite.

06:46.600 --> 06:49.834
Followed by cinnamon and,
uh, the... Tootsie.

06:49.834 --> 06:51.600
Rae, forget about egg rolls.

06:51.600 --> 06:53.500
Look, if you really want
to help, why don't you

06:53.500 --> 06:55.600
and Eddie and Chelsea
come down to The Chill Grill

06:55.600 --> 06:57.133
after school
and help set the tables?

06:57.133 --> 06:58.100
They can't.

06:58.100 --> 06:59.300
Why not?

06:59.300 --> 07:02.000
Because they got to blurf.

07:02.000 --> 07:03.567
Say what?

07:09.767 --> 07:12.367
(<i>gasps </i>)

07:12.367 --> 07:15.600
Well, now I know
what blurfing is.

07:15.600 --> 07:17.100
What did you see?

07:17.100 --> 07:18.900
Disaster.
Eddie and Chelsea, they...

07:18.900 --> 07:21.500
they looked like
they were about to-to...

07:21.500 --> 07:24.133
kiss.

07:24.133 --> 07:25.767
So why is that so bad?
Because, Dad,

07:25.767 --> 07:27.200
we have always been
a threesome.

07:27.200 --> 07:29.300
If they become a twosome,
then I become a onesome.

07:29.300 --> 07:31.367
Then if they break up,
we become three onesomes,

07:31.367 --> 07:34.133
which is definitely not
as good as one threesome.

07:35.834 --> 07:37.967
Well, sometimes
your visions aren't exactly

07:37.967 --> 07:39.667
what you think
they are.

07:39.667 --> 07:41.967
Look, Rae, why don't you just
ask Eddie and Chelsea

07:41.967 --> 07:43.400
straight up what's going on?

07:43.400 --> 07:45.300
Yeah.

07:45.300 --> 07:47.133
I guess you're right.

07:47.133 --> 07:49.667
Hey, so what's going on
with you two?

07:49.667 --> 07:51.400
Nothing.
Nothing.

07:51.400 --> 07:53.100
Oh, 'cause, um...

07:53.100 --> 07:56.600
lately it's kind of
seemed like something.

07:56.600 --> 08:00.800
Well, uh, sometimes nothing
can seem like something.

08:00.800 --> 08:03.800
And yet sometimes something
can actually be something.

08:03.800 --> 08:05.400
Unless it's nothing.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.800
Nothing yet or nothing at all?

08:06.800 --> 08:09.000
'Cause if it's nothing at all,
we can do it together.

08:09.000 --> 08:10.967
Can't.

08:10.967 --> 08:12.000
Why not?

08:12.000 --> 08:13.400
Because if three people
do nothing,

08:13.400 --> 08:15.867
then it actually
becomes something.

08:24.600 --> 08:26.300
Hey, Mr. Brizowski,

08:26.300 --> 08:27.767

11:40.667 --> 11:42.133
a dance for her dad's

Yeah. She'd probably want us
to do everything her way.

Right. Just leave
her clueless.
Right.

All right.

11:58.000 --> 11:59.367
Hello.

11:59.367 --> 12:01.000
Hey there, little lady.
I'm your plumber.

Y'all just keep on doing
what you're doing.

12:03.400 --> 12:06.200
I'm called the Invisible
Plumber, so I'm just
going to be invisible.

12:06.200 --> 12:08.100
Oh, actually, sir,
it's our upstairs
bathroom...

12:08.100 --> 12:09.133
Hey, little lady...

12:10.200 --> 12:11.500
who is your plumber?

12:11.500 --> 12:12.900
You are.
So what's my name?

12:12.900 --> 12:14.500
Mr. Plumber, sir.

12:16.734 --> 12:18.800
Okay, so where were we?

12:18.800 --> 12:20.100
Oh, hang on a second.

12:20.100 --> 12:22.100
I'm going to go

Could we use
a little bit of privacy?

12:30.033 --> 12:31.233
Thank you.
Okay.

12:34.100 --> 12:36.300
Now we can get
our groove on.

Right. Let's do it.

No more interruptions.

We need more room.

off real quick.

EDDIE:
All right, okay.
Ready?

13:39.000 --> 13:40.800
Okay, Chelse...

Hi.

14:01.867 --> 14:03.000
I was just wondering

14:03.000 --> 14:04.967
if everything's
all right in here.

14:04.967 --> 14:06.300
Yes, no worries now.

I'm a plumber, so I'm plumbing,
'cause that's what

Now get out!

Oh, it's my bracelet.

Oh, okay.

Okay, um...

this does?

when I get done chewing it.

16:00.200 --> 16:01.500
My oatmeal is not chewy.

to be firewood.

Now, Victor, chill.

a little fun at you.

my mom, tiger?

Yeah, pretty... loud.

16:24.100 --> 16:25.467
No, no, baby, no.

But the most embarrassing
sounds my parents make...

...is when they
just ate beans...

Excited?
Mm-hmm.

Don't you mean hurt...

Oh, no, no, silly.

The other excited--
like happy.

17:10.800 --> 17:12.567
Rae, why are you
being like this?

17:12.567 --> 17:15.467
Because I know what you guys
were doing behind my back.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.934
Oh, you do?

17:18.934 --> 17:20.934
Yeah. Why didn't you tell me?

17:20.934 --> 17:23.400
I don't know-- we knew
if we told you, you know,

17:23.400 --> 17:25.033
you'd want to control
our every move.

17:25.033 --> 17:26.300
Oh! Oh!

17:26.300 --> 17:29.300
I don't even want to think
about y'all's moves.

17:29.300 --> 17:31.500
Well, Rae, you're
going to have to,

17:31.500 --> 17:34.300
'cause we're going
to do them onstage.
Oh!

17:35.200 --> 17:37.300
Onstage in front of everyone?!

17:37.300 --> 17:38.367
Now listen up

17:39.767 --> 17:41.400

You nasty...!

You just can't get
up onstage...

17:57.767 --> 18:00.600
Honey, what did you think
they were doing?

18:00.600 --> 18:03.000
Uh... I thought they were
doing something,

18:03.000 --> 18:05.934
but a whole different
little something-something.

going to believe this.

were in love with each other.

What?!

18:35.300 --> 18:37.700
(<i>song continues </i>)

18:46.000 --> 18:48.467
I had a vision that you guys
were going to kiss.

18:48.467 --> 18:51.100
What?!

18:52.867 --> 18:55.767
I was obviously wrong.

18:57.033 --> 18:58.200
You know what?

18:58.200 --> 18:59.700
Not that I would
want to interfere

18:59.700 --> 19:00.700
or anything...

19:00.700 --> 19:02.000
Girl, then good,
then get off

19:02.000 --> 19:04.734

You guys,

19:26.100 --> 19:27.100
that was so cool.

19:27.100 --> 19:28.100
Thanks, Rae.

19:28.100 --> 19:29.300
And sorry we
didn't tell you.

19:29.300 --> 19:30.500
It's just that
we wanted

19:30.500 --> 19:31.967
to do this one
thing by ourselves.

19:31.967 --> 19:33.233
Oh, look, I'm sorry, okay?

19:33.233 --> 19:35.500
For being so bossy and being
in your business

19:35.500 --> 19:37.233
and thinking you two
were together.

19:37.233 --> 19:39.200
Especially for that
hole in the wall.

19:39.200 --> 19:41.867
What wall?
Huh?

19:41.867 --> 19:43.300
Um...

19:43.300 --> 19:44.800
the wall, Chelsea,
that, um...

19:44.800 --> 19:47.500
that wall that's been
blocking our friendship, girl.

19:47.500 --> 19:48.867
Oh, that is
so weird.

19:48.867 --> 19:51.600
I thought you were talking
about the hole

19:51.600 --> 19:53.467
in the wall
in our bathroom.

19:53.467 --> 19:55.500
Whoo, we are suing
the plumber.

19:55.500 --> 19:56.967
Uh... look...

19:56.967 --> 19:58.033
I just want to apologize

19:58.033 --> 19:59.767
for being so
controlling this week.

19:59.767 --> 20:02.233
You know, I've been so
wound up for this opening--

20:02.233 --> 20:04.233
trying to make it
as cool as it can be,

20:04.233 --> 20:06.100
and you know, Devon
didn't even show up.

20:07.400 --> 20:08.734
Actually, Rae,
Devon is over there

20:08.734 --> 20:09.734
talking to your dad.

20:09.734 --> 20:10.800
Come on.

20:10.800 --> 20:11.667
Okay.

20:13.867 --> 20:15.133
Hey, Dad, where'd
Devon go?

20:15.133 --> 20:16.133
That guy?

20:16.133 --> 20:17.567
I sent him down to Wong's.

20:17.567 --> 20:20.467
You know, you were right--
kids do love egg rolls.

20:23.834 --> 20:25.967
CHELSEA:
Hey.

20:25.967 --> 20:27.000
You missed him, huh?

20:27.000 --> 20:28.367
Yeah.
But it's okay, you know.

20:28.367 --> 20:30.200
I'd rather spend
tonight with you guys.

20:30.200 --> 20:31.400
Ah.

the three blind mice.

20:36.700 --> 20:39.667
Well, that's not
really fair

20:39.667 --> 20:44.100
because you guys took
all the good ones.

We shall.

come true.

My own restaurant
full of family and friends

21:29.767 --> 21:31.300
