00:02.235 --> 00:03.770
<i>Previously on</i> Young Sheldon...
Your friends all know about

00:03.837 --> 00:06.106
your "secret boyfriend"?
You think that's you?

00:06.172 --> 00:07.974
Well...

00:08.041 --> 00:09.242
It's not?

00:09.309 --> 00:10.343
I understand
you're moving forward

00:10.410 --> 00:12.112
with Sheldon's grant database.

00:12.178 --> 00:13.680
I was an intrinsic part of that.

00:13.747 --> 00:15.248
Sheldon didn't mention you.

00:15.315 --> 00:17.784
Of course he didn't, that
pint-sized little credit hog.

00:17.851 --> 00:20.687
We're looking for a financier,
not a partner.

00:20.754 --> 00:22.522
I just want to be
around the process.

00:22.589 --> 00:24.290
But I'm still in charge, right?

00:24.357 --> 00:26.593
Did NASA fake the moon landing?
No.

00:26.659 --> 00:28.395
See, that's what I thought
until about a year ago.

00:28.461 --> 00:30.430
Oh, we're gonna
have so much fun.

00:32.966 --> 00:34.300
So the data comes in here,

00:34.367 --> 00:36.069
and then it's divided
into three tables

00:36.136 --> 00:38.872
that I'm calling X-sub-1,
X-sub-2, X-sub-3.

00:38.938 --> 00:40.306
Good, good.

00:40.373 --> 00:42.942
And then over here, it's
subjected to data normalization,

00:43.009 --> 00:46.279
so we don't end up with
any duplicate data fields.

00:46.346 --> 00:47.280
GARY (over speaker):
I've got it.

00:47.347 --> 00:48.882
Grant Daddy.

00:48.948 --> 00:49.883
What?

00:49.949 --> 00:51.184
The name of our company:

00:51.251 --> 00:52.419
Grant Daddy.

00:52.485 --> 00:54.053
I mean, it's sexy
and sophisticated,

00:54.120 --> 00:57.023
but still John Q. Lunchpail
can wrap his arms around it.

00:57.090 --> 00:58.525
Where are you?

00:58.591 --> 01:00.660
Oh, you know, my lawyers
have advised me not to say,

01:00.727 --> 01:02.295
but I'm pretty sure I'll be
allowed back in the country

01:02.362 --> 01:03.930
very soon.

01:03.997 --> 01:05.632
Taxes, am I right?

01:05.698 --> 01:07.033
Huh.

01:07.100 --> 01:08.701
Right now we have more
important things to focus on

01:08.768 --> 01:10.937
than the name, like how
are we going to build this.

01:11.004 --> 01:12.071
Grant-opolis.

01:12.138 --> 01:13.773
Grant-cano.

01:13.840 --> 01:15.208
No, wait.

01:15.275 --> 01:16.576
The Grant Canyon.

01:16.643 --> 01:19.512
Oh, that's gonna
look great on a T-shirt.

01:19.579 --> 01:20.880
Hey, what size do you guys wear?

01:20.947 --> 01:22.382
This is not helpful.
Can't I hang up on him?

01:22.449 --> 01:23.983
Sheldon, I have to remind you

01:24.050 --> 01:26.586
GARY: Hello?
he's funding
the entire project.

01:26.653 --> 01:28.254
He should remain included.

01:28.321 --> 01:29.789
Hello?
Fine.

01:29.856 --> 01:32.158
The Grant Canyon
is a terrible name.

01:32.225 --> 01:34.194
It sounds like a place
grants go to die.

01:34.260 --> 01:35.195
Sheldon.

01:35.261 --> 01:37.464
I'm including him.

01:37.530 --> 01:40.433

01:40.500 --> 01:42.936

01:57.350 --> 01:59.252
So, how are you feeling?

01:59.319 --> 02:01.421
Fat and disgusting.

02:01.488 --> 02:04.390
I mean, are you having
any discomfort, fatigue?

02:04.457 --> 02:05.959
Yeah, that's all I have.

02:06.025 --> 02:08.862
I think what she's saying is
she feels eight months pregnant.

02:08.928 --> 02:10.530
Eight. 800.

02:10.597 --> 02:12.966
Hey, sorry I'm late.

02:13.032 --> 02:14.367
Just a reminder, Doc,

02:14.434 --> 02:15.869
I don't want to know
if it's a boy or girl.

02:15.935 --> 02:17.704
I want it to be a surprise.
Wait, hold up.

02:17.770 --> 02:19.906
If we're all here,

02:19.973 --> 02:22.642
who's looking after the
Laundromat and the video store

02:22.709 --> 02:25.245
and the, uh,
other establishment?

02:25.311 --> 02:26.713
Oh, the gambling room?

02:26.779 --> 02:28.047
Huh?

02:28.114 --> 02:30.517
It's okay. I lost
a hundred bucks there last week.

02:30.583 --> 02:32.085
Oh. (chuckles)

02:32.151 --> 02:34.687
Then you know
we're good for the bill.

02:34.754 --> 02:36.389
Okay, uh, back to me.

02:36.456 --> 02:38.791
Uh, how's everything looking
in the oven?

02:38.858 --> 02:40.093
Well, baby seems okay,

02:40.159 --> 02:41.928
but I am concerned about
your blood pressure.

02:41.995 --> 02:43.830
Mm. You think
it's preeclampsia?

02:43.897 --> 02:45.698
Georgie, let the doctor talk.

02:45.765 --> 02:47.200
Actually, that's a possibility.

02:47.267 --> 02:48.835
I read the book. Did you?

02:48.902 --> 02:50.537
NICHOLSON:
I'd like to put you on

02:50.603 --> 02:52.805
bed rest for a week
and then recheck you.

02:52.872 --> 02:54.407
Is that really necessary?

02:54.474 --> 02:55.441
It is.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.345
Dr. Linkletter, I had a question
about today's lecture.

02:59.412 --> 03:01.047
I'm sorry, who are you?

03:01.114 --> 03:02.549
You must be Sheldon.

03:02.615 --> 03:03.816
I am.

03:03.883 --> 03:05.818
I was told not to talk to you.

03:05.885 --> 03:06.786
Why not?

03:06.853 --> 03:08.588
I was told not to tell you that.

03:08.655 --> 03:10.723
Ah, I see you've met Toby.

03:10.790 --> 03:12.559
I have not.
He wouldn't tell me his name.

03:12.625 --> 03:15.428
Good man. What can I help
you with, Sheldon?

03:15.495 --> 03:16.963
What's all this?

03:17.030 --> 03:20.500
It looks like algorithms
for a searchable database.

03:20.567 --> 03:22.635
At a glance,
anything can look like

03:22.702 --> 03:24.537
an algorithm
for a searchable database.

03:25.505 --> 03:28.942
Very well, it's an algorithm
for a searchable database.

03:29.008 --> 03:30.343
That was my idea.

03:30.410 --> 03:32.579
If you'll recall,
it was our idea.

03:32.645 --> 03:34.080
Are you programming

03:34.147 --> 03:35.715
a database for him?

03:35.782 --> 03:38.484
Go ahead.
Yeah.

03:38.551 --> 03:40.119
Yeah.

03:40.186 --> 03:42.755
How dare you steal my
grant database idea?

03:42.822 --> 03:45.725
Look, Dr. Linkletter
was part of the idea,

03:45.792 --> 03:47.594
he's an employee
of the university,

03:47.660 --> 03:49.495
and therefore we have
a legitimate claim to it.

03:49.562 --> 03:50.830
But I'm already making one.

03:50.897 --> 03:52.332
I have an investor
lined up and everything.

03:52.398 --> 03:54.467
Well, you're still
more than welcome to join us,

03:54.534 --> 03:56.035
and we can all
work on it together.

03:56.102 --> 03:58.738
No, this is my idea,
and I'm doing it on my own.

03:58.805 --> 04:01.407
Well, then I guess we'll see
who gets to market first.

04:01.474 --> 04:03.076
I guess we will.

04:03.142 --> 04:05.478
Hmm. So, have you already
started programming?

04:05.545 --> 04:06.746
No.

04:06.813 --> 04:08.881
Do you have access
to a mainframe?

04:08.948 --> 04:11.818
That depends. Can I use
the university's mainframe?

04:11.884 --> 04:14.120
No.
Then we're still
figuring it out.

04:14.187 --> 04:15.388
I see.

04:15.455 --> 04:16.990
Well, we already have
a name, do you?

04:17.056 --> 04:19.792
As a matter of fact, we do.
We're calling it Granted.

04:19.859 --> 04:22.662
Ugh, that is
such a good name.
Thank you.

04:22.729 --> 04:25.031
And what's yours?

04:26.099 --> 04:27.533
Never mind.

04:29.569 --> 04:30.837
WOMAN:
<i>Hey.</i>

04:30.903 --> 04:33.506
Look what your machine
did to my underwear.

04:33.573 --> 04:35.241
Made 'em huge?

04:35.308 --> 04:37.243
It dyed 'em pink.

04:37.310 --> 04:38.511
Oh, right.

04:38.578 --> 04:40.013
Here.
Next wash is on us.

04:40.079 --> 04:41.781
I got to go check on
something in the back.

04:41.848 --> 04:45.151
Sorry, I'm a little
short-staffed today.

04:45.218 --> 04:48.688
I've been running around like
a chicken with its head cut off.

04:48.755 --> 04:50.256
All right.

04:50.323 --> 04:52.425
There's your
teddy bear.

04:52.492 --> 04:53.793
Here's your cash.

04:53.860 --> 04:56.162
Teddy bear. Cash.

04:56.229 --> 04:57.530
Teddy bear.

04:57.597 --> 04:59.565
Hey, this is
a dry cleaning ticket.

04:59.632 --> 05:01.701
Get out of here.

05:01.768 --> 05:04.270
Punk.
(sign chiming)

05:06.372 --> 05:07.974
Hang on, I'll be right back.

05:09.175 --> 05:11.110
Hey, you find
everything all right?

05:11.177 --> 05:12.478
Yeah.

05:12.545 --> 05:13.680
Oh, that there's
a real good one.

05:13.746 --> 05:15.048
You should get it.
I'll ring it up.

05:15.114 --> 05:16.315
I don't know.

05:16.382 --> 05:18.351
Don't know? Whoopi Goldberg
as a singing nun?

05:18.418 --> 05:19.619
What's there to think about?

05:19.686 --> 05:20.953
I might be more in
the mood for action.

05:21.020 --> 05:22.789
She's on the run from the mob.

05:22.855 --> 05:24.691
You'll love it. I'll ring it up.

05:25.625 --> 05:27.460
How you doing?

05:27.527 --> 05:31.864
Uh, well, I'm lying in bed and a
nice lady just brought me food.

05:31.931 --> 05:33.299
It's not the worst.

05:33.366 --> 05:36.703
Well, you haven't tasted it yet.
Doctor said no salt.

05:36.769 --> 05:37.770
Oh, I'm sure
it's great.

05:37.837 --> 05:39.972
I tasted it. It sucks.

05:40.039 --> 05:43.443
Anyway, I better
go give Georgie a hand.

05:43.509 --> 05:46.813
Um, here's your telephone.

05:46.879 --> 05:48.181
Anything else you need
before I go?

05:48.247 --> 05:50.183
Actually, I can't
find the remote.

05:50.249 --> 05:52.385
Oh, well,
it couldn't have gone far.

05:52.452 --> 05:53.720
Let's see.

05:53.786 --> 05:56.222
Let me just look
right down here.

05:56.289 --> 05:58.324
Okay. Here it is.

05:58.391 --> 06:00.660
Oh! (grunts)
My back!

06:00.727 --> 06:01.661
Are you okay?

06:01.728 --> 06:03.196
No!
All right.

06:03.262 --> 06:04.297
Let me help you up.

06:04.363 --> 06:06.099
No, no. No, no.
I'm fine. I'm fine.

06:06.165 --> 06:08.134
I'm ju-just... Let me lay here
for just a minute.

06:08.201 --> 06:10.002
Can I get you
some ice or something?

06:10.069 --> 06:12.038
No, no, no.
You've got to stay in bed.

06:12.105 --> 06:13.740
(exhales) Okay.
Well, you look like

06:13.806 --> 06:15.875
the "I've fallen and
I can't get up" lady.

06:15.942 --> 06:19.345
That's because I have fallen
and I can't get up.

06:19.412 --> 06:20.480
(laughs)

06:20.546 --> 06:22.348
Okay, it hurts when I laugh.

06:22.415 --> 06:24.250
(laughing)

06:24.317 --> 06:25.284
Here, honey.

06:25.351 --> 06:27.353
Here you go.
Oh, thanks.

06:27.420 --> 06:29.922
Oh!

06:36.229 --> 06:38.064
(gasps) Oh, dear Lord,
let me help you up.

06:38.131 --> 06:39.499
Don't touch me.

06:39.565 --> 06:41.901
Don't touch me.
I'll get up when I'm ready.

06:41.968 --> 06:43.369
Should I call the doctor?

06:43.436 --> 06:45.605
No, no. It just happens
every once in a while.

06:45.671 --> 06:47.373
I just need to
take it easy for a couple days.

06:47.440 --> 06:49.242
Then I'll be fine.
Well,

06:49.308 --> 06:50.943
can I get you a pillow?

06:51.010 --> 06:53.312
Ooh. A pillow would be nice.

06:54.881 --> 06:56.415
Here.
(moans)

06:57.517 --> 06:58.985
And what's going on with you?

06:59.051 --> 07:01.387
Oh, high blood pressure.
Doctor wants me on bed rest.

07:01.454 --> 07:03.356
Probably worried about
preeclampsia.

07:03.422 --> 07:05.758
Did everyone read this book?

07:05.825 --> 07:08.928
Well, I can take off work
and look after y'all.

07:08.995 --> 07:10.496
We're fine.

07:10.563 --> 07:11.898
Fine? You're on the floor.

07:11.964 --> 07:13.800
What happens if you
need to use the bathroom?

07:13.866 --> 07:15.668
Depends.

07:15.735 --> 07:17.203
Depends on what?

07:17.270 --> 07:19.205
No, it's a joke.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.407
(laughs)
I got it.

07:21.474 --> 07:24.443
(laughing)
What's the joke?

07:26.879 --> 07:28.381
Tell me.

07:28.447 --> 07:29.882
(line ringing)

07:29.949 --> 07:32.985
(old woman's voice):
Hello, Mr. O'Brien's office.

07:33.052 --> 07:34.554
Is Mr. O'Brien there?

07:34.620 --> 07:37.089
It's John Sturgis
and Sheldon Cooper.

07:37.156 --> 07:38.691
(normal voice):
Oh, it's me.

07:38.758 --> 07:40.626
I was just making sure
you weren't the IRS. What's up?

07:40.693 --> 07:42.128
I have some troubling news.

07:42.195 --> 07:44.764
The university is making
a competing grant database.

07:44.831 --> 07:46.632
Wasn't it your idea?
SHELDON: It was,

07:46.699 --> 07:49.235
but Dr. Linkletter
is claiming he assisted me.

07:49.302 --> 07:50.803
Well, there's nothing wrong
with a little competition.

07:50.870 --> 07:52.305
I mean, you think
I was the only person

07:52.371 --> 07:54.507
designing anti-static
lab furniture?

07:54.574 --> 07:56.209
You weren't?
GARY: No.

07:56.275 --> 07:59.512
I researched the competition,
outbid their manufacturers

07:59.579 --> 08:02.048
and tied them up in court
so long they ran out of money.

08:02.114 --> 08:03.916
That seems a little ruthless.

08:03.983 --> 08:07.753
Hey, if you're not ruthless,
you're toothless.

08:07.820 --> 08:09.121
I like that.

08:09.188 --> 08:10.656
I know. It rhymes.

08:10.723 --> 08:12.959
But the university's
already ahead of us.

08:13.025 --> 08:16.596
Yeah, but do they have
a really cool company name?

08:16.662 --> 08:19.165
Yes, they're calling it Granted.

08:19.232 --> 08:21.601
Damn, it was right there.

08:21.667 --> 08:24.203
Okay, I can't cover
the video store, the Laundromat,

08:24.270 --> 08:26.706
and the other room
all at the same time.

08:26.772 --> 08:28.474
I want to work
in the other room.

08:28.541 --> 08:30.309
You're not working
the other room.

08:30.376 --> 08:31.377
I got the other one.

08:31.444 --> 08:33.145
I call dibs on
video store.

08:33.212 --> 08:35.047
Aw. I wanted video store.

08:35.114 --> 08:36.582
Too bad. I called dibs.

08:36.649 --> 08:38.084
Great, you got the Laundromat.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.552
But I don't want the Laundromat.

08:39.619 --> 08:41.287
Well, dibs are dibs.
She called it.

08:41.354 --> 08:42.555
He's a good boss.

08:42.622 --> 08:44.090
That's right.

08:45.424 --> 08:47.093
Slow.

08:49.629 --> 08:52.131
Slow.
Any slower and
we're just standing.

08:52.198 --> 08:54.834
Okay, look, I got this, okay?
Just leave me alone.

08:54.901 --> 08:57.737
All right. I'm gonna
go check on Mandy.

08:59.739 --> 09:01.240
Slow.

09:01.307 --> 09:03.309
(knocking)
MARY: Hi.

09:03.376 --> 09:04.644
You doing okay?

09:04.710 --> 09:06.913
(TV clicks off)
I'm fine.

09:06.979 --> 09:08.915
You really don't need
to fuss over me.

09:08.981 --> 09:11.050
Oh, I don't mind.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.319
I appreciate it.

09:13.386 --> 09:15.187
I'm just kind of
used to taking care of myself.

09:15.254 --> 09:18.090
Well, that's what family's for.

09:19.058 --> 09:22.228
Speaking of which,
do you want me to call yours?

09:22.295 --> 09:23.462
Why?

09:23.529 --> 09:25.698
If my daughter was on bed rest,

09:25.765 --> 09:26.966
I would want to know.

09:27.033 --> 09:28.401
If they want
to know how I'm doing,

09:28.467 --> 09:29.835
they can pick up
the phone and call.

09:29.902 --> 09:32.338
I'm sure if your mom
knew what was going on,

09:32.405 --> 09:33.606
she'd be here to help.

09:33.673 --> 09:34.907
Well, I told my mom
I was pregnant

09:34.974 --> 09:37.009
and she stopped
talking to me. So...

09:37.076 --> 09:38.110
I know, but...

09:38.177 --> 09:39.812
It's not your business, Mary.

09:42.148 --> 09:44.684
Okay, sorry.

09:47.453 --> 09:49.689
(toilet flushes)

09:51.424 --> 09:53.125
Hello, Toby.

09:53.192 --> 09:54.927
I'm not supposed to talk to you.

09:54.994 --> 09:57.363
But no one told you
not to talk to me.

09:57.430 --> 09:58.631
What do you want?

09:58.698 --> 10:00.366
We want to
offer you a job.

10:00.433 --> 10:02.301
And for you
to wash your hands.

10:02.368 --> 10:03.903
I already have a job.

10:03.970 --> 10:05.438
We know.

10:05.504 --> 10:09.308
We want you to do the
same thing, but for more money.

10:09.375 --> 10:10.810
Okay.

10:12.111 --> 10:14.780
Really, that's all it took?
Where's the loyalty?

10:14.847 --> 10:16.983
Sheldon, this is
what we want.

10:17.049 --> 10:18.617
I know, but what if
somebody comes along

10:18.684 --> 10:20.853
and offers him more money?
Is he just gonna leave us?

10:20.920 --> 10:22.388
Are you?

10:22.455 --> 10:23.522
Probably.

10:24.390 --> 10:27.526
We can hire him, but he cannot
go to the bathroom alone.

10:27.593 --> 10:29.495
Welcome aboard.

10:30.129 --> 10:32.798
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's hit that sink.

10:37.770 --> 10:39.505
If you're looking for
something to watch,

10:39.572 --> 10:40.740
I'd recommend
<i>Princess Bride.</i>

10:40.806 --> 10:42.808
Really?
I know it sounds

10:42.875 --> 10:45.211
a little girly, but there's
an awesome sword fight

10:45.277 --> 10:46.912
and André the Giant's in it.

10:46.979 --> 10:49.148
Cool. Thanks.

10:49.215 --> 10:50.716
Just doing my job.

10:51.784 --> 10:55.021
I'm Melissa, by the way.

10:57.356 --> 10:58.324
♪ We should be together... ♪

10:58.391 --> 10:59.992
Need any help over here?

11:01.027 --> 11:03.429
Are you trying
to touch my underwear?

11:03.496 --> 11:05.097
No, ma'am.

11:05.164 --> 11:07.433
Well, then step away.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.102
Yes, ma'am.

11:11.270 --> 11:14.073
Ah! I knew it.
You poached my programmer.

11:14.140 --> 11:15.708
You poached his idea.

11:15.775 --> 11:18.044
Toby, what happened to loyalty?

11:18.110 --> 11:19.645
It's annoying, isn't it?

11:19.712 --> 11:21.614
There's an old saying:

11:21.680 --> 11:24.450
"You mess with the bull,
you get the horns."

11:24.517 --> 11:25.785
Well, there's a new saying:

11:25.851 --> 11:27.453
"We have a programmer
and you don't."

11:27.520 --> 11:29.321
(giggles) Yeah.

11:29.388 --> 11:30.356
HAGEMEYER:
<i>Really?</i>

11:30.423 --> 11:31.891
You poached our programmer?

11:31.957 --> 11:34.093
I left him alone for five
minutes to use the bathroom.

11:34.160 --> 11:35.594
I don't know why
you're so surprised.

11:35.661 --> 11:37.630
I'm told that business
is a high-stakes game

11:37.696 --> 11:39.665
where if you're not ruthless,
you're toothless.

11:39.732 --> 11:41.000
We just learned that.

11:41.067 --> 11:42.501
You could have hired
anyone else.

11:42.568 --> 11:44.270
Coulda, woulda, shoulda.

11:44.336 --> 11:45.471
Oh, you want
to play hardball?

11:45.538 --> 11:46.972
We can do that, too.

11:47.039 --> 11:49.942
You see, Sheldon gets a lot
of perks at this university

11:50.009 --> 11:52.211
that could go away real fast.

11:52.278 --> 11:54.146
But I like my perks.

11:54.213 --> 11:56.348
How would you like to have
a roommate or two

11:56.415 --> 11:57.883
in that dorm room of yours?

11:57.950 --> 11:59.952
Let's give her what she wants.

12:00.019 --> 12:02.021
Stay strong.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.790
Look, all I'm saying is you
need us as much as we need you.

12:04.857 --> 12:06.792
Now, for example,
we have

12:06.859 --> 12:08.894
a mainframe computer
and you don't.

12:08.961 --> 12:12.798
Ha! No mainframe, no database.
Who's toothless now?

12:12.865 --> 12:15.034
We can get our own mainframe.

12:15.101 --> 12:17.770
We can? They're
really expensive.

12:17.837 --> 12:20.372
I'm trying to be ruthless.
Work with me here.

12:20.439 --> 12:22.074
We can.

12:29.915 --> 12:32.485
Hey. I brought you a snack
and some magazines.

12:32.551 --> 12:35.588
Oh, thanks, but I should
probably finish this.

12:35.654 --> 12:37.456
Although I do know how it ends.

12:37.523 --> 12:40.659
With bodily fluids.
Everywhere.

12:40.726 --> 12:42.862
And then
a sweet little boy or girl.

12:42.928 --> 12:46.065
Oh, um, it's a girl.

12:46.132 --> 12:47.633
(gasps) Really?

12:47.700 --> 12:49.969
Yeah, Georgie didn't
want to know so I haven't said.

12:50.035 --> 12:52.338
Well, that is wonderful!

12:52.404 --> 12:54.773
Oh, it'll be our little secret.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.910
MEEMAW:
I already know! Don't go
feeling like you're special.

12:57.977 --> 13:01.213
Do you mind? We're
having a moment here.

13:02.014 --> 13:02.982
Carry on.

13:03.048 --> 13:05.117
(sighs) As you can see,

13:05.184 --> 13:06.752
the mother-daughter bond
is strong.

13:06.819 --> 13:10.156
Well, compared to me and my mom,
you two are magic.

13:10.222 --> 13:13.626
Well, we've had
our ups and downs.

13:14.560 --> 13:17.496
She wasn't the easiest
mom to grow up with.

13:17.563 --> 13:20.266
Sometimes I felt like I was
kind of raising myself.

13:20.332 --> 13:23.769
But now we're
practically best friends.

13:23.836 --> 13:26.772
Yeah, I don't think that's
in the cards for me and my mom.

13:26.839 --> 13:30.643
I hear you whispering in there.
Don't listen to her, Mandy.

13:30.709 --> 13:32.645
Dear Lord, I was
just telling her

13:32.711 --> 13:34.847
how you and I
are best friends!

13:34.914 --> 13:38.551
That's how you talk
to your best friend?

13:39.518 --> 13:40.986
Everything working okay for you?

13:41.053 --> 13:44.523
I heard about you.
You're that panty sniffer.

13:44.590 --> 13:47.193
No. No, no, no,
there was no sniffing.

13:47.259 --> 13:48.794
Barbara, he doing it again.

13:50.596 --> 13:53.399
No. No. Uh, j...
Oh, I give up.

13:53.465 --> 13:54.867
I'm totally into old movies.

13:54.934 --> 13:58.437
You know,<i> Breakfast Club,</i>
<i>Goonies, Pretty in Pink.</i>

13:58.504 --> 14:00.739
Hey. How's it going?

14:00.806 --> 14:02.174
Fine. Bye.

14:02.241 --> 14:03.542
Not much going on
at the Laundromat.

14:03.609 --> 14:04.710
Thought maybe I could
lend you a hand.

14:04.777 --> 14:07.279
Nope, all good.
Go check on Georgie.

14:07.346 --> 14:08.681
All right.

14:08.747 --> 14:12.318
So, you doing anything later?

14:12.384 --> 14:15.187
Yeah, she's going home
with her father.

14:15.254 --> 14:16.555
Dad.

14:16.622 --> 14:18.557
I-I'm sorry, sir,
I didn't know.

14:18.624 --> 14:20.659
Yeah, did you know that
she's in the seventh grade?

14:20.726 --> 14:21.493
Dad!

14:21.560 --> 14:22.628
I thought she was older.

14:22.695 --> 14:24.296
Well, now you know.
Beat it.

14:24.363 --> 14:25.898
Right.

14:26.899 --> 14:29.368
(door opens and closes)
Are you happy?

14:29.435 --> 14:31.337
He is way too old for you.

14:31.403 --> 14:32.838
Have you seen you and Mom?

14:32.905 --> 14:35.441
Hey, your mother and I were
high school sweethearts.

14:35.507 --> 14:38.510
Yeah, she was in high school.
You were, like, 25.

14:38.577 --> 14:41.213
People looked older back then.

14:41.280 --> 14:42.915
<i>(knocking)</i>

14:42.982 --> 14:44.650
Hello?

14:44.717 --> 14:46.585
Yeah, I'm here to
install some bunk beds.

14:46.652 --> 14:48.921
But I don't need bunk beds.
I'm just one person.

14:48.988 --> 14:51.724
All I know is they're turning
this room into a triple.

14:51.790 --> 14:53.058
Triple?

14:53.125 --> 14:55.661
This is getting serious.
They're playing hardball.

14:55.728 --> 14:57.563
And hardball is just one more
type of ball I'm bad at.

14:57.630 --> 14:58.597
GARY:
Okay, just

14:58.664 --> 14:59.765
calm down.
I'm sure

14:59.832 --> 15:01.267
I can find us
a used mainframe.

15:01.333 --> 15:02.901
Where? How? From whom?

15:02.968 --> 15:05.437
I don't know, but Jupiter
just entered Sagittarius,

15:05.504 --> 15:06.872
so I have a good feeling.

15:06.939 --> 15:09.408
You're not filling me
with confidence, Gary.

15:09.475 --> 15:12.378
Ah, teenagers.
Always so angsty.

15:12.444 --> 15:14.413
I love it.

15:15.247 --> 15:16.915
(sighs)

15:29.995 --> 15:31.330
Hey, Mom, it's me.

15:32.164 --> 15:35.000
No, nothing's wrong.
I was just calling to talk.

15:37.436 --> 15:38.837
No, I am not calling

15:38.904 --> 15:40.539
to apologize.

15:40.606 --> 15:42.841
No, I don't
need any money.

15:42.908 --> 15:44.643
No, I don't need
anything from you.

15:44.710 --> 15:46.478
You know what?
This was a mistake.

15:46.545 --> 15:48.547
Yeah, goodbye.

15:55.354 --> 15:56.822
Hi.
Welcome to Video Village.

15:56.889 --> 15:59.658
I'm Missy, I'm in seventh grade,
and that's my father.

15:59.725 --> 16:01.160
Uh, hi.

16:01.226 --> 16:02.995
I'm Carl,

16:03.062 --> 16:05.864
I'm 31, and my dad is dead.

16:05.931 --> 16:08.367
Yeah, I'm sorry
about her.

16:08.434 --> 16:10.469
And your dad.

16:10.536 --> 16:12.538
What are you doing?

16:12.604 --> 16:14.606
Saving you the trouble
of embarrassing me.

16:14.673 --> 16:17.943
Look, it's not easy
seeing you talk to guys.

16:18.010 --> 16:20.079
Especially older guys.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.647
You want to know
what's not easy?

16:21.714 --> 16:23.315
Hearing from Billy Sparks
about you and his mother

16:23.382 --> 16:24.883
hanging out
in their chicken coop.

16:26.218 --> 16:27.653
What?

16:27.720 --> 16:30.155
He said he saw y'all
leaving there the other day.

16:30.222 --> 16:32.958
(snorts)
We were talking chickens.

16:33.025 --> 16:35.594
And he said
it wasn't the first time.

16:36.562 --> 16:38.163
They got a lot of chickens.

16:38.230 --> 16:39.598
(sighs)

16:39.665 --> 16:41.500
And now there's
bunk beds in my room?

16:41.567 --> 16:43.736
It's like summer camp.
Two words I loathe.

16:43.802 --> 16:47.473
Sometimes roommates can
become lifelong friends.

16:47.539 --> 16:49.641
I still exchange letters
with my roommate

16:49.708 --> 16:51.110
from the mental hospital.

16:51.176 --> 16:53.479
They're written in a language
he made up,

16:53.545 --> 16:56.248
but it's nice to know he cares.

16:56.315 --> 16:59.518
I have a delivery
for Sheldon Cooper.

16:59.585 --> 17:00.586
That's me. What is it?

17:00.652 --> 17:02.521
A computer mainframe.

17:02.588 --> 17:04.022
He got one.

17:04.656 --> 17:06.925
I just need to tell
the guys where to put it.

17:06.992 --> 17:10.596
Well, I suppose
it could go in here.

17:10.662 --> 17:13.966
Or I think I have a solution
to my roommate problem.

17:14.032 --> 17:16.268
I can't have roommates
if my dorm has no room

17:16.335 --> 17:17.469
for those mates.

17:17.536 --> 17:19.705
Right this way.

17:32.584 --> 17:35.487
So, you know, me and
Brenda are just friends.

17:35.554 --> 17:37.055
She's been going through
a rough patch

17:37.122 --> 17:39.091
and just needed
someone to talk to.

17:39.158 --> 17:41.493
Okay.

17:41.560 --> 17:43.061
Good.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.632
Why'd you say it was
about chickens?

17:48.700 --> 17:52.137
Because it's Brenda's
personal business,

17:52.204 --> 17:55.541
and-and just trying
to be a good neighbor.

17:56.875 --> 17:59.244
And she don't want
Billy to worry,

17:59.311 --> 18:01.814
so we used the chicken coop.

18:01.880 --> 18:03.982
Which all makes sense, right?

18:04.049 --> 18:05.517
I guess.

18:05.584 --> 18:07.152
Good.

18:10.622 --> 18:13.258
I'm glad we can talk
about these things.

18:13.325 --> 18:15.060
Me too.

18:15.127 --> 18:18.130
Someday we'll talk
about Mom and Pastor Rob.

18:19.465 --> 18:21.567
(door opens)

18:23.001 --> 18:25.938
Excuse me, are you
Mrs. McAllister?

18:26.004 --> 18:27.806
I am.
Can I help you?

18:27.873 --> 18:31.109
I'm Mary Cooper.
Georgie's mom.

18:32.478 --> 18:34.480
Oh. Hello.

18:34.546 --> 18:38.150
I don't know what's going on
between you and your daughter,

18:38.217 --> 18:40.486
but you need to get over it.

18:40.552 --> 18:44.256
She is scared, she is pregnant,
and she needs her mother.

18:45.090 --> 18:47.226
I'm getting parenting advice
from a woman

18:47.292 --> 18:50.295
whose 17-year-old son
got my daughter pregnant?

18:50.362 --> 18:51.663
Yes, you are.

18:51.730 --> 18:53.065
Georgie made a mistake,

18:53.131 --> 18:55.367
but I did not cut him
out of my life.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.969
You don't know...

18:57.035 --> 18:58.070
I don't care.

18:58.136 --> 19:00.439
You are her parent.
Act like it.

19:00.506 --> 19:03.976
So, grow up, call your daughter
and make it right.

19:04.042 --> 19:04.977
Now!

19:05.043 --> 19:06.345
Well, I need...

19:06.411 --> 19:07.646
I said now.

19:09.114 --> 19:11.283
I was gonna say

19:11.350 --> 19:13.752
I need the phone number.

19:15.220 --> 19:17.122
Okay.

19:17.189 --> 19:18.690
Do you have a pen?

19:25.531 --> 19:26.732
All right.

19:26.798 --> 19:28.066
Plug it in.

19:28.133 --> 19:29.301
(knocking)

19:29.368 --> 19:30.402
Huh?

19:31.203 --> 19:32.604
Hello.

19:32.671 --> 19:33.739
(sighs)

19:33.805 --> 19:35.440
Unbelievable.

19:35.507 --> 19:36.942
President Hagemeyer, have you
come to meet my new roommate,

19:37.009 --> 19:38.443
VAX 6000?

19:38.510 --> 19:40.812
Sheldon, you can't have
a mainframe in your dorm.

19:40.879 --> 19:42.281
Actually, there's
no rule against it.

19:42.347 --> 19:44.483
I can't have a
candle, a microwave,

19:44.550 --> 19:47.352
a hot plate, a coffee maker,
a toaster or a waterbed.

19:47.419 --> 19:48.687
But there's nothing
against a mainframe.

19:48.754 --> 19:51.089
Well, I'm the president
of the university

19:51.156 --> 19:52.991
and I'm telling you
you can't.

19:53.058 --> 19:56.161
You're just trying
to sabotage our project

19:56.228 --> 19:58.997
because you know
we're gonna beat you to market.

19:59.064 --> 20:00.832
Sheldon, plug it in.

20:15.180 --> 20:17.616
SHELDON:
<i>There really should be</i>
<i>a rule against this.</i>
