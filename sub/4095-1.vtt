00:18.103 --> 00:21.573
- Come on, babe. Look at the camera.
- What?

00:21.673 --> 00:24.109
- Camera. Come on, make love to the camera.
- Stop it.

00:24.209 --> 00:26.945
- Camera. Come on, make love to the camera.
- Oh, come on, stop it.

00:27.045 --> 00:29.581
- What are you doing?
- Nothing. Turn around. Turn around.

00:29.681 --> 00:32.186
Okay, what? What do you want?
What should I say?

00:32.286 --> 00:34.819
Send a message.
Something to our children.

00:34.919 --> 00:37.088
Our children? Really?

00:37.188 --> 00:39.690
Well, the ones
we're gonna have, you know?

00:41.760 --> 00:44.796
We fall in love, we move in,
we get married, we have kids.

00:44.896 --> 00:47.645
Those kids go through our things
and find the old shoebox

00:47.745 --> 00:49.200
filled with tapes years later.

00:49.300 --> 00:52.095
Forever. Just say your name,
say your age.

00:52.195 --> 00:54.439
Turn around. Say your name,
your age, blow a kiss to the camera.

00:54.539 --> 00:58.541
Hi, I'm Eve. I just turned 21.

05:19.704 --> 05:23.272
Sorry, I couldn't get here before.
Too much work.

05:26.277 --> 05:29.378
You didn't die on me, did ya?

05:31.916 --> 05:36.518
Poor sick... little puppy.

05:42.393 --> 05:46.295
Come on now, I bought
the vegetables you wanted.

05:47.165 --> 05:50.868
I cooked the soup like you like it.
It's all for you.

05:50.968 --> 05:53.871
There's no reason to share anymore.
It's... it's for you.

05:53.971 --> 05:56.207
Just eat something, okay?

05:56.307 --> 06:00.075
I'm coming back later
to see if, you know...

06:01.979 --> 06:04.268
You know, I know you're starving...

06:36.814 --> 06:38.482
Come here.

06:40.118 --> 06:41.660
Come here.

06:45.857 --> 06:49.744
Eve, Eve, listen to me. Wait.

07:17.822 --> 07:19.557
No!

07:20.651 --> 07:22.091
Come on.

07:30.902 --> 07:32.554
Please!

07:38.976 --> 07:40.629
No!

07:51.522 --> 07:53.175
Fuck!

07:58.229 --> 07:59.881
Fuck!

08:14.045 --> 08:17.001
Please, somebody help!

08:36.634 --> 08:38.236
- This is gonna happen.
- Come on, please. I don't...

08:38.336 --> 08:40.004
No, no, no, come on. Come on.

08:40.104 --> 08:42.907
...happen, I promise.
You trust me? You trust me?

08:43.006 --> 08:45.843
Not that you... What's gonna...
Come on. Come on!

08:45.943 --> 08:48.246
- Ladies first.
- I can't.

08:48.446 --> 08:50.481
- Don't make me do this.
- You're just a little nervous?

08:50.581 --> 08:52.901
- What are you doing?
- Stand here. Stand here.

08:56.888 --> 08:59.590
Oh, my God. Why am I doing this?

08:59.690 --> 09:02.026
No reason to fear here.
There is no fear here.

09:02.126 --> 09:03.679
I got ya.

10:03.821 --> 10:05.841
Keys.

10:40.358 --> 10:42.077
Ronnie.

10:43.360 --> 10:44.362
- Do you love me?
- No.

10:44.462 --> 10:46.097
Do you love me?

10:46.197 --> 10:48.032
- Yes. Yes, I love you.
- How much do you love me?

10:48.132 --> 10:50.885
Alright, no, no, no,
I'm not answering that.

11:29.273 --> 11:31.679
I can go all night, bitch.

13:07.305 --> 13:09.391
Now what?

13:09.974 --> 13:13.027
Coming back to apologize?

13:15.980 --> 13:18.200
What happened to these girls?

13:20.517 --> 13:25.069
Girls. You did have fun upstairs.

13:25.169 --> 13:28.725
- What'd you find?
- How many girls did you take here?

13:29.815 --> 13:34.310
Here? What makes you think
I would bring them here?

13:35.799 --> 13:39.220
- Tell me where they are.
- Why would I do that?

13:39.970 --> 13:42.413
Because if you don't, I'll kill you.

13:52.316 --> 13:54.919
I think you're forgetting...

13:55.019 --> 13:59.657
I'm the only one who knows
where they are. So...

14:00.358 --> 14:02.710
if you kill me...

14:03.093 --> 14:06.815
then you're killing
all the rest of them.

14:09.600 --> 14:12.490
You didn't think about that.

14:17.725 --> 14:19.077
Oh, God.

14:20.844 --> 14:25.692
So what now? You gonna let them all die?

14:26.617 --> 14:29.253
Just like you did before.

14:29.853 --> 14:32.837
Remember over there in the corner?

14:37.861 --> 14:42.200
Go ahead. End it right here.

14:42.720 --> 14:47.371
All you want is your own
little piece of revenge, isn't it?

14:47.871 --> 14:49.940
Go ahead, kill me.

14:50.040 --> 14:52.509
Kill them.

14:52.609 --> 14:54.111
Bang.

14:54.511 --> 14:56.264
Bang.

14:57.381 --> 14:58.933
Bang.

14:59.617 --> 15:01.136
Bang.

15:02.653 --> 15:04.121
Bang.

15:04.221 --> 15:05.719
Fuck!

15:05.819 --> 15:09.493
Tell me where they are. Last chance.

15:09.593 --> 15:11.128
You're losing it.

15:11.228 --> 15:13.864
- Talk.
- Talk.

15:13.964 --> 15:16.100
Yeah, I talk and you shoot me
in the head.

15:16.200 --> 15:19.020
- Shut up!
- And one more thing.

15:20.270 --> 15:21.961
I promise you...

15:23.340 --> 15:26.411
you'll never find them without me.

15:33.731 --> 15:37.405
- What are you gonna do now?
- Reload.

15:40.207 --> 15:41.959
So what's the plan?

15:42.059 --> 15:44.436
You are gonna take me
to the other girls.

15:45.346 --> 15:51.051
You think I'm just gonna let you drive me
around town like a dog on a leash?

15:51.151 --> 15:53.356
And then we just...

15:53.456 --> 15:57.071
set the girls free one by one?

15:57.558 --> 15:59.378
Is that your plan?

16:01.895 --> 16:04.064
Hand me the keys to the van.

16:04.164 --> 16:06.017
Right now!

16:14.908 --> 16:16.450
Yeah.

16:16.550 --> 16:18.512
Hey, where you going?

16:18.612 --> 16:23.751
You know, you don't want this on you.
I mean, 4 dead girls? God!

16:23.851 --> 16:28.072
Because you ran away?
Because you left them?

17:20.273 --> 17:21.842
Put it on.

17:21.942 --> 17:24.678
Put this around your neck.

17:24.877 --> 17:28.215
I'll put it on. You take me
to the hospital, I'll put it on.

17:29.716 --> 17:31.819
Where'd you learn how to do
the brick thing?

17:31.919 --> 17:35.370
- Put this around your neck.
- Yeah, I'd love to. I'd love to do that.

17:35.470 --> 17:37.858
Fuck off! Put it on!

17:37.958 --> 17:41.328
- Wanna make a deal?
- Put it on.

17:41.428 --> 17:44.598
You take me to the hospital,
I'll show you the girls.

17:44.698 --> 17:48.102
I'll take you to the girls,
you take me to the hospital.

17:48.402 --> 17:52.215
- Deal. Put it on.
- Deal. Okay.

17:53.574 --> 17:55.193
No!

17:55.843 --> 17:58.445
- Wait a minute.
- Open the lock.

17:58.545 --> 18:00.732
Unlock it right now.

18:07.254 --> 18:10.391
No more talking. Get the fuck up now!

18:11.091 --> 18:14.812
You fuck with me, it'll be the last thing
you ever do. You hear me?

18:15.362 --> 18:16.463
- Come on.
- Go!

18:16.563 --> 18:18.449
I'm going.

18:21.902 --> 18:23.737
To the driver's seat. Now!

18:23.837 --> 18:26.524
- I can't even breathe.
- Get the keys.

18:32.145 --> 18:34.954
- Go.
- Getting there.

18:37.818 --> 18:41.488
- Innate there.
- Let's go.

18:41.588 --> 18:43.857
- Where to?
- What?

18:43.957 --> 18:47.261
I mean, we can either go
to the girl that's the closest

18:47.361 --> 18:50.764
or we can go to the one
that hasn't eaten in a week.

18:50.864 --> 18:54.001
- In a week?
- Yeah.

18:54.101 --> 18:59.473
I never could get top dollar
from any of those girls like I did for you.

18:59.573 --> 19:02.009
You are one special girl.

19:02.109 --> 19:04.425
Just take me to the closest!

19:24.064 --> 19:26.133
You look like you know
how to handle a weapon.

19:26.233 --> 19:27.835
I like tough women. I like tough women.

19:27.935 --> 19:30.377
- You better.
- Yeah.

19:33.140 --> 19:35.952
Come on. Please?

19:36.352 --> 19:38.512
Calm down. Everything's gonna be fine.

19:38.612 --> 19:41.065
- You trust me, right?
- Yeah.

19:42.983 --> 19:44.877
Oh, my God!

19:58.281 --> 19:59.834
How much further is it?

20:02.769 --> 20:05.506
They're all... pretty close together.

20:05.606 --> 20:09.193
No sense driving all over town, right?

20:32.900 --> 20:37.704
- Stop right here. Turn it off.
- It's off. It is off.

20:37.804 --> 20:42.660
- Come here, fucker. Get over here!
- Alright. Loosen it up.

20:44.311 --> 20:49.283
- Who's in there? Who's in the house?
- What? Nobody's in there. I mean...

20:50.526 --> 20:55.370
- The girl is, of course. She's the black one.
- Where's the light? Where's the light?

20:56.189 --> 20:58.659
Alright, ease up.

20:58.859 --> 21:01.709
I can't remember her name.
What's her name?

21:02.696 --> 21:05.165
Nina. Her name is Nina.

21:05.265 --> 21:07.167
Nina. Yeah. Yeah.

21:07.267 --> 21:08.769
- Go, move.
- You know she is...

21:08.869 --> 21:11.605
Move, fucker. Don't even think
about trying anything.

21:11.705 --> 21:14.074
I'm not trying anything.

21:14.574 --> 21:17.561
- Open the door.
- Oh, God!

21:18.712 --> 21:20.681
There are...

21:21.081 --> 21:23.483
- Let me get the keys.
- Shut the fuck up. Open the door.

21:23.583 --> 21:25.636
The right keys.

21:27.788 --> 21:29.474
Let's go.

21:36.129 --> 21:38.098
Jesus Christ!

21:38.198 --> 21:40.780
Yeah, she's a bad host.

21:48.942 --> 21:51.562
You're gonna remember
our deal though, right?

22:02.406 --> 22:05.054
- Open the door.
- Alright.

22:24.911 --> 22:26.998
This is too tight.

22:35.355 --> 22:37.023
I'm not...

22:37.123 --> 22:40.794
I'm not hearing anything.
I'm not seeing anything.

22:41.294 --> 22:45.032
- No, no.
- No, don't!

22:45.332 --> 22:47.200
- Calm down. Calm down.
- No, no.

22:47.300 --> 22:48.368
You're getting her...

22:48.468 --> 22:51.104
Just stop, stop, stop.
It's okay. It's okay.

22:51.204 --> 22:53.874
- She's done! You can't help her.
- Shut up!

22:54.574 --> 22:56.977
- No. No. No.
- It's okay. I'm here to help you...

22:57.077 --> 23:01.048
- She's broken! Don't do it. Don't do it.
- It's okay, it's okay.

23:01.848 --> 23:05.219
No, no. Nina! Nina! No, Nina!

23:05.319 --> 23:07.244
Nina! Nina!

23:08.588 --> 23:10.774
Nina! No.

23:11.425 --> 23:14.261
No, Nina! No. No!

23:14.961 --> 23:16.497
No, stop!

23:17.397 --> 23:19.599
Nina, stop!

23:19.699 --> 23:21.419
Wait.

23:23.536 --> 23:25.689
Did she escape?

23:28.074 --> 23:29.927
Where is she?

23:43.156 --> 23:45.188
Oh, my God.

24:09.649 --> 24:11.569
Oh, shit!

24:36.042 --> 24:39.145
Hey, Eve. See this...

24:39.245 --> 24:44.117
It's not all hero shit here,
is it, sweet cheeks?

24:44.217 --> 24:47.071
Yeah. You thought
she was gonna help you?

24:58.798 --> 25:01.167
- Get up!
- Wait.

25:01.267 --> 25:03.154
I'll get up.

25:04.905 --> 25:06.991
I'll get up.

25:10.577 --> 25:12.630
Get up, asshole.

25:26.259 --> 25:29.196
- Oh, shit.
- Get in the van now. Let's go!

25:29.296 --> 25:31.549
Jesus! Fuck!

25:35.635 --> 25:39.798
- So who you gonna save now?
- The closest.

25:40.473 --> 25:43.477
The closest. Okay.

25:43.777 --> 25:46.979
That would be little Laura.

25:56.022 --> 25:58.124
How much further till the next one?

25:58.224 --> 26:00.602
Couple of blocks.

26:00.994 --> 26:06.579
So... you gonna do the same thing
with this girl that you do with Nina?

26:06.679 --> 26:09.369
- Nice job, by the way.
- Shut up.

26:09.469 --> 26:13.673
The best thing that girl had going
for her was that room back there.

26:13.773 --> 26:16.817
And you fucking took it away.

26:21.915 --> 26:25.619
You know... but don't worry about it.

26:25.719 --> 26:28.822
Nobody'll miss her.
It's always like that.

26:28.922 --> 26:31.075
Nobody cares.

26:31.408 --> 26:34.728
Unless you're white, rich.

26:35.628 --> 26:37.581
Anyway...

26:38.164 --> 26:40.767
hope you got a new plan 'cause...

26:40.867 --> 26:42.886
here we are.

26:43.703 --> 26:46.506
Beautiful little Laura.

26:46.606 --> 26:49.083
I gave her that name. Pretty, isn't it?

26:49.183 --> 26:52.970
Remember, they're not all
as sweet as you are.

26:53.070 --> 26:54.832
Get out.

26:55.749 --> 26:58.185
Going to the long route.

26:58.585 --> 27:00.237
Move.

27:00.954 --> 27:02.455
- Take the keys.
- Hey, look...

27:02.555 --> 27:05.542
Take the keys! Go.

27:06.059 --> 27:08.145
This thing's choking.

27:08.595 --> 27:10.280
Move.

27:10.830 --> 27:13.650
- Where is it?
- It's this way.

27:28.881 --> 27:30.935
Right this way.

27:31.718 --> 27:33.286
Over here.

27:33.386 --> 27:35.973
Do you like what she's done
with the place?

27:41.561 --> 27:44.782
- You gonna kill this one too?
- Move.

27:48.735 --> 27:50.704
Laura.

27:50.804 --> 27:52.066
Laura.

27:54.374 --> 27:56.193
Laura, here.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.481
Get that thing off of her!

28:01.581 --> 28:04.050
- Won't do.
- Get that fuckin' thing off of her!

28:04.150 --> 28:07.520
Alright. I will.

28:07.620 --> 28:11.141
Laura, listen to me. Listen to my voice.

28:14.027 --> 28:15.409
Let me get this.

28:18.965 --> 28:21.219
I'm gonna get this off of you.

28:23.770 --> 28:26.706
Okay. Okay. There we go.

28:26.806 --> 28:29.048
I got that off of you.

28:29.709 --> 28:31.478
- Listen to me
- Hurry up.

28:31.578 --> 28:34.114
We have... company.

28:34.914 --> 28:36.750
I want you to meet Eve.

28:36.850 --> 28:39.019
- Hurry up.
- This is Eve.

28:39.119 --> 28:41.788
- Unchain her.
- Why are you here?

28:41.888 --> 28:44.508
- Unchain her, right now.
- Okay.

28:45.225 --> 28:47.427
I'm here to help you, okay?

28:47.527 --> 28:50.447
- What do you want?
- I wanna set you free.

28:51.698 --> 28:56.036
I've been warning you. They are not
all like you, sweet cheeks. Alright.

28:56.136 --> 28:57.355
Get over here.

29:02.058 --> 29:03.777
Let's get this off.

29:04.778 --> 29:06.679
Who is this slut?

29:06.779 --> 29:10.917
Oh, you didn't have to say that.
She's a nice girl.

29:11.017 --> 29:15.709
Eve is a sweet, sweet girl.

29:15.929 --> 29:18.672
And she has come here...

29:19.425 --> 29:22.045
She is here...

29:23.696 --> 29:25.465
to take your place.

29:25.565 --> 29:28.486
- Nobody takes my place!
- No, no, no! Stop!

29:35.108 --> 29:38.128
Get her! Get her!

29:38.578 --> 29:41.732
- Kill her! Kill her!
- No.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.103
Get her!

31:04.864 --> 31:06.333
- You shot me!
- You piece of shit.

31:06.433 --> 31:10.270
- You shot me, sweet cheeks!
- Fuck you! I hate you. Fuck you!

31:10.370 --> 31:13.557
You piece of shit. Die!

31:13.806 --> 31:15.241
Die!

31:15.341 --> 31:17.810
- Oh, I missed you.
- I missed you too.

31:17.910 --> 31:19.896
No, stop it.

31:22.048 --> 31:24.144
- Don't leave.
- I don't want to.

31:41.801 --> 31:45.722
- You have to fight me now.
- I don't want to...

31:59.002 --> 32:01.855
- You gonna scream?
- No.

32:03.890 --> 32:05.909
This will hurt.

32:09.562 --> 32:12.607
Don't worry. You'll get used to it.

32:13.099 --> 32:14.834
What?

32:15.134 --> 32:16.887
The pain.

32:17.703 --> 32:20.517
Those girls aren't anything like you.

32:22.709 --> 32:24.811
You're different.

32:24.911 --> 32:26.897
Just nicer.

32:28.248 --> 32:30.316
You wanted this.

32:30.416 --> 32:32.385
You set me up.

32:32.785 --> 32:34.571
Kind of.

32:36.739 --> 32:38.358
Okay.

32:38.891 --> 32:41.728
Seems like your plan is not working.

32:41.828 --> 32:46.575
Just... take me to the police station.

32:47.217 --> 32:49.566
All this will be over.

32:50.703 --> 32:53.072
At least I can finish this.

32:56.309 --> 32:59.394
Alright. Okay.

32:59.762 --> 33:00.916
You win.

33:02.281 --> 33:04.134
I give up.

33:06.002 --> 33:08.672
I never meant to hurt anybody.

33:10.556 --> 33:14.578
I never wanted it to end up like this.
You gotta believe me.

33:18.698 --> 33:22.702
I'm not a great man, okay?

33:24.337 --> 33:26.706
I have no life.

33:26.806 --> 33:28.507
No money. Nothing.

33:28.607 --> 33:31.361
So that's why you destroy
other people's lives?

33:33.346 --> 33:35.365
You suffered.

33:37.350 --> 33:41.371
I... suffered, too. I did.

33:45.224 --> 33:48.082
I watched my mother...

33:52.532 --> 33:57.386
rot away... with cancer for 5 years.

33:58.638 --> 34:00.691
It wasn't quick.

34:02.642 --> 34:06.607
It was slow and it was painful.

34:07.413 --> 34:10.116
And I couldn't do anything about it.

34:10.216 --> 34:12.302
I was broke.

34:13.319 --> 34:15.815
I couldn't ease her pain.

34:18.024 --> 34:20.172
I couldn't help her.

34:22.094 --> 34:25.789
I couldn't even give her
a proper funeral.

34:26.799 --> 34:28.819
Listen to me.

34:29.235 --> 34:31.570
I didn't take you.

34:32.605 --> 34:34.858
I don't do that.

34:36.042 --> 34:39.696
I take care... of you.

34:40.346 --> 34:42.766
I never touched you.

34:44.817 --> 34:46.339
I'm not the hunter.

34:47.520 --> 34:49.873
I'm only a...

34:52.491 --> 34:54.510
zookeeper.

34:56.629 --> 34:59.116
It wasn't personal.

35:00.833 --> 35:04.896
All I ever wanted was a decent life.

35:04.996 --> 35:08.572
A family. Maybe a son.

35:11.677 --> 35:13.697
Just like...

35:14.847 --> 35:19.018
- Ronnie would have wanted.
- What the fuck did you just say?

35:19.118 --> 35:20.904
Ronnie.

35:22.288 --> 35:25.602
- You know what, now it's your turn.
- No, no, no, no, no.

35:25.702 --> 35:28.330
- Yeah, come on.
- My name's Ronnie.

35:29.374 --> 35:32.832
- I'm 25.
- What the fuck do you know about Ronnie?

35:32.932 --> 35:35.885
I'm just saying your boyfriend...

35:37.303 --> 35:41.407
Nothing. I just saw him on TV.

35:43.075 --> 35:46.045
Listen, I'll give you something big.

35:46.145 --> 35:48.481
It's bigger than me.

35:48.581 --> 35:51.368
It's bigger than these girls.

35:51.884 --> 35:53.853
Ronnie knew about it.

35:53.953 --> 35:55.955
What the fuck are you talking about?

35:56.055 --> 36:00.627
Ronnie... he went to look
for you when you disappeared.

36:00.727 --> 36:03.129
All over town.

36:03.229 --> 36:05.498
He never found you.

36:05.598 --> 36:07.984
But he found some things.

36:09.101 --> 36:11.588
Horrible things.

36:13.039 --> 36:15.847
I can show you what he found.

36:18.044 --> 36:21.121
After the next house, after we get Lea.

36:21.647 --> 36:25.525
No more tricks. No more surprises.

36:29.622 --> 36:31.424
Wait! Hey, now. Come on, give it back.

36:31.524 --> 36:32.992
- No.
- This is my home video.

36:33.092 --> 36:34.360
- Come on. Do you love me?
- No.

36:34.460 --> 36:36.980
- Do you love me?
- Come on.

39:52.992 --> 39:57.048
Turn off the light! Turn it off!

39:57.596 --> 40:00.065
- They kidnapped me.
- Calm down. It's okay. Calm down.

40:00.165 --> 40:03.286
- Help me. Help me.
- Calm down.

40:05.671 --> 40:08.207
Okay, it's okay.
Look, I'm here to help you.

40:08.307 --> 40:12.345
I'm gonna get you the fuck out of here.
You gotta relax. Okay, just relax.

40:12.645 --> 40:16.891
- They're gonna come back!
- Who's coming back?

40:19.035 --> 40:21.387
Okay, but what's his van doing here?

40:21.487 --> 40:23.622
Even old Phil, he probably
wanted to ride a show.

40:23.722 --> 40:26.325
Come on, man.
He always takes the first ride.

40:26.425 --> 40:29.395
- What the fuck was that?
- Did you hear that?

40:29.495 --> 40:30.801
What the fuck?

40:31.764 --> 40:33.566
You.

40:33.666 --> 40:36.903
- Give it to her. Give it to her now.
- I'm gonna give it to her.

40:37.303 --> 40:39.889
- Give it to her.
- I wanna give it to her.

40:40.206 --> 40:42.961
I... I can go all night, bitch!

41:06.632 --> 41:08.652
Motherfucker!

41:16.942 --> 41:18.962
You fucking...

41:43.202 --> 41:45.521
It's okay, it's okay.

41:55.447 --> 41:56.949
Fuck you!

41:57.049 --> 41:59.869
You fucking piece of shit! Fuck you!

41:59.969 --> 42:01.821
Fuck you!

42:08.627 --> 42:10.820
- Like that?
- We gotta go.

42:10.920 --> 42:12.698
Fucking like that?

42:12.798 --> 42:16.168
- You got any real clothes?
- Who are you?

42:16.268 --> 42:19.171
Here. Change.

42:19.271 --> 42:21.591
Who the fuck are you?

42:23.142 --> 42:25.328
Look, we don't have much time, okay?

42:29.715 --> 42:33.252
- Let's go.
- I don't give a shit who you are, okay?

42:33.352 --> 42:36.355
I just want to know
who to thank for saving my ass.

42:36.455 --> 42:39.792
Help. Help me.

42:39.892 --> 42:42.277
- Come on. Shoot him!
- Help.

42:42.377 --> 42:43.829
Shoot this motherfucker!

42:43.929 --> 42:46.350
It'll be more painful
if you just leave him.

42:51.036 --> 42:55.407
Hey! Why aren't we calling the cops?
I'm sure they were gonna rape me in there.

42:55.507 --> 42:57.779
What's wrong with you?

42:58.510 --> 43:00.312
Where are you going?

43:00.412 --> 43:03.441
Do you know
what they did to me in there?

43:05.918 --> 43:08.487
What the fuck is your problem?

43:08.587 --> 43:12.008
Hey! Are you fucking listening to me?

43:12.691 --> 43:14.908
Get in if you're getting in.

43:26.438 --> 43:29.579
Christ. Fuck!

43:30.976 --> 43:32.662
Fuck!

43:35.614 --> 43:38.951
Fuck! Fuck! No!

43:39.051 --> 43:40.608
No!

43:44.556 --> 43:47.280
You killed them.

43:51.063 --> 43:53.188
You fucking bitch.

43:59.805 --> 44:02.841
You killed them.

44:02.941 --> 44:04.645
Every one of them.

44:07.880 --> 44:10.676
Wait, I feel like I'm gonna
be sick. Stop.

44:10.776 --> 44:12.701
- Hey!
- What?

44:12.851 --> 44:15.172
- Hi.
- Oh, I missed you.

44:19.158 --> 44:21.110
Are you okay?

44:22.061 --> 44:23.880
Okay!

44:26.414 --> 44:30.987
- Are you alright?
- Yeah. Thanks to you, right?

44:35.040 --> 44:36.893
Is this you?

44:41.847 --> 44:45.285
Do you know this girl? Katrina?

44:47.553 --> 44:50.088
How did you know where I was?

44:53.525 --> 44:56.516
What the fuck!
That's the guy who grabbed me.

44:56.616 --> 45:00.131
- What the fuck is he doing here?
- Wake up!

45:00.231 --> 45:02.401
- Fuck.
- Are you listening to me?

45:02.501 --> 45:05.966
- Hey!
- Why is this piece of shit here?

45:06.066 --> 45:09.723
- We gotta fucking kill this piece of shit.
- No! We made a deal.

45:09.823 --> 45:12.266
- Told you, no tricks.
- Just shut up!

45:12.366 --> 45:15.631
- I don't give a shit about your deal.
- Stop.

45:16.515 --> 45:19.885
- You're as crazy as he is.
- You are crazy.

45:19.985 --> 45:22.880
You would kill her to save me?

45:23.121 --> 45:27.143
You know... she killed
those other two girls.

45:30.462 --> 45:34.133
Don't you get it? I found you!

45:34.233 --> 45:37.420
And now we need to find her.
Are you in or are you out?

45:41.440 --> 45:42.378
Okay.

45:42.478 --> 45:45.831
I'm not going anywhere with her.
She's not part of the deal.

45:45.931 --> 45:49.047
How do I know you won't just stand there
while she beats me?

45:49.147 --> 45:53.136
- You know what? That's a fucking good idea.
- Shut up. Both of you. Can you drive?

45:54.519 --> 45:57.573
Then, do it. Let's go.

46:03.262 --> 46:06.130
You gonna kill her too?

46:06.865 --> 46:09.384
Another dead body.

46:10.185 --> 46:14.040
The only dead bodies are in the house.

46:15.007 --> 46:17.393
What dead bodies?

46:20.145 --> 46:22.165
Shut up.

46:34.393 --> 46:36.996
Now... tell me what Ronnie found.

46:37.296 --> 46:39.431
Who the fuck is Ronnie?

46:39.631 --> 46:41.867
Tell me where he went.

46:42.067 --> 46:44.087
- Or lose it.
- Fuck you!

46:48.574 --> 46:51.440
Now, we're gonna try again.
If you tell me to fuck off one more time,

46:51.540 --> 46:53.912
I swear to God, they'll be calling you
lefty for the rest of your life.

46:54.012 --> 46:55.978
Other ones are closer...

46:56.078 --> 46:58.033
- you fucking lunatic.
- What others?

46:58.850 --> 47:01.487
The ones Ronnie found.

47:01.887 --> 47:03.722
What are you talking about?
Who did he find?

47:03.822 --> 47:05.641
- When? Why is he there?
- 101 South.

47:05.741 --> 47:07.830
Why was Ronnie there?

47:08.210 --> 47:10.729
Take me to the hospital.

47:10.829 --> 47:13.165
- We had a deal.
- Hey, do you want me to turn around?

47:13.265 --> 47:15.494
- Drive, just drive.
- If you don't take me there,

47:15.594 --> 47:17.532
I'm not gonna make it.

47:21.173 --> 47:23.909
Fine. I'll keep you alive.

47:24.009 --> 47:26.144
Even when you're begging me to kill you.

47:26.244 --> 47:29.265
101 South.

47:57.542 --> 47:59.745
What is this place?

47:59.845 --> 48:03.900
Somewhere you don't wanna be
for very long.

48:05.484 --> 48:07.753
Door 4.

48:07.853 --> 48:10.185
You can't miss it.

48:10.922 --> 48:13.692
Ronnie even found it.

48:13.792 --> 48:16.679
- Let's go.
- What about him?

48:17.729 --> 48:20.899
- He's not going anywhere.
- This is a bad idea.

48:20.999 --> 48:23.229
Yeah, this whole night's
been a bad fucking idea.

48:31.877 --> 48:34.215
What if there are more men in there?

48:36.014 --> 48:37.080
Then, I kill them.

48:44.823 --> 48:47.693
Come on. Come on.

48:47.793 --> 48:50.212
- Goddammit.
- Let me try.

48:50.696 --> 48:52.281
Okay.

50:01.900 --> 50:05.621
Be careful. Stay behind me, okay?

50:08.874 --> 50:12.082
I think it's here. Come on.

50:56.755 --> 51:00.693
Who did this to you?
Who runs this place?

51:01.293 --> 51:04.313
- Who did this to you?
- Eve...

51:04.629 --> 51:07.283
what if they're still here?

51:07.983 --> 51:10.052
What are you doing here?

51:11.002 --> 51:13.505
We wait for the big man.

51:13.605 --> 51:15.838
He bring us here.

51:16.274 --> 51:18.794
New girls come every few week.

51:19.678 --> 51:22.414
He bring them here, then...

51:22.514 --> 51:25.168
girls come and go as they buy.

51:26.518 --> 51:30.121
Men come here, they choose girl...

51:30.221 --> 51:33.892
- prettier girls go first.
- Is there anyone else here?

51:33.992 --> 51:36.621
It's okay. We're here to help.

51:36.721 --> 51:39.731
A man, a tall man. H... he run off.

51:39.831 --> 51:42.199
- What?
- Shit! We gotta go.

51:42.299 --> 51:46.438
What? Wait here, okay?
We'll call the police.

51:46.538 --> 51:49.541
- Are we just gonna leave them in here?
- There's someone else here. We gotta go.

51:49.641 --> 51:52.577
We can't leave them here.
Where are you going?

51:52.677 --> 51:56.615
- We can't stop. We have to go to the next house.
- Why? Why should we keep going?

51:56.715 --> 51:59.851
Because there are more girls
I have to save. I have to save them.

51:59.951 --> 52:03.339
And I had to save you
because I had to try!

52:07.359 --> 52:10.195
- I gotta go.
- Are you really gonna leave us here?

52:10.295 --> 52:13.118
Eve, what happened to you?

52:21.473 --> 52:25.744
I'm sorry. Just... thank you. Okay?

52:25.844 --> 52:28.212
For saving my life.

52:32.284 --> 52:36.354
Look... just stay here
and get some help, okay?

52:36.454 --> 52:40.417
There's got to be a phone around here
somewhere. Just wait for the police to arrive.

52:41.059 --> 52:44.113
- Be careful.
- What about the douchebag in the van?

52:45.497 --> 52:48.363
Yeah, I got a bone to pick
with that asshole.

53:22.267 --> 53:23.719
Sweet cheeks.

53:34.679 --> 53:36.832
Sweet cheeks.

53:38.166 --> 53:40.416
Stupid motherfucker, don't move!

53:41.987 --> 53:43.939
Watch out.

53:45.456 --> 53:48.377
This hero stuff is harder than it seems?

53:48.477 --> 53:50.395
You already killed two women...

53:50.495 --> 53:52.615
you wrestled a giant and...

53:53.331 --> 53:55.384
guess what?

53:56.701 --> 53:59.374
Wanna call the cops now?

54:01.506 --> 54:03.894
Now, bring her to me.

54:04.776 --> 54:08.105
Bring her to me.

54:24.129 --> 54:25.948
Help!

54:28.900 --> 54:30.016
No!

54:41.179 --> 54:42.264
No!

54:43.414 --> 54:46.785
You probably should have killed me
when you had a chance, sweet cheeks.

54:46.885 --> 54:49.421
I love it when they wiggle around
like that.

54:49.521 --> 54:52.041
Yeah, she's a lot of fun.

54:54.592 --> 54:57.538
Let's just shoot her
in the face right here.

54:59.064 --> 55:01.099
After what she did tonight?

55:01.199 --> 55:04.169
Fuck her. Let's take our time.

55:04.269 --> 55:06.871
- You're the boss.
- Shoot her in the leg.

55:06.971 --> 55:09.358
Right where she shot me. Yeah.

55:26.424 --> 55:28.860
- Are you okay?
- Yeah.

55:28.960 --> 55:31.830
- Hey, now.
- I will be.

55:31.930 --> 55:34.852
Wait, we had a deal, right?
You're not gonna forget that.

55:34.952 --> 55:38.605
We had a fucking deal.
Katrina, the last girl, she wasn't here.

55:38.705 --> 55:41.740
Where is she? Last chance,
tell me where the next house is.

55:42.740 --> 55:44.309
Well, well, I...

55:44.409 --> 55:48.664
- Oh, God!
- Try to fuck with me again, motherfucker.

55:58.289 --> 56:00.491
1404...

56:00.591 --> 56:02.494
Brown.

56:02.594 --> 56:04.079
Fuck.

56:04.179 --> 56:06.531
1404 Brown.

56:06.731 --> 56:08.900
It's the last house.

56:09.000 --> 56:11.817
I'm sure you're gonna love
the last house.

56:16.408 --> 56:19.595
- Yeah, that wasn't so bad.
- Yeah, I know.

56:21.446 --> 56:23.048
- You went to Spain?
- I did.

56:23.148 --> 56:26.651
That's what I wanna do. I wanna travel.
I wanna travel, see the whole world.

56:26.751 --> 56:28.498
- It changes your perspective.
- Yeah.

56:28.598 --> 56:30.088
Look how beautiful that is.

56:30.188 --> 56:34.877
- Hurry up. The cops will be here any minute.
- Make sure they find the girls, okay?

56:39.831 --> 56:42.734
Eve... are you sure about this?

56:42.834 --> 56:47.381
The last girl, she didn't make it.
Okay? I... I can't...

56:47.481 --> 56:51.242
Eve, you saved me.
And you've saved those girls.

56:51.342 --> 56:53.896
Do what you gotta do, okay?

57:20.605 --> 57:23.792
<i>You have one new voice message.</i>

57:24.842 --> 57:27.612
<i>Phil, where are you?</i>

57:27.712 --> 57:30.081
<i>You still at the office?</i>

57:30.181 --> 57:33.518
<i>Anyways, don't forget to get the cereal
for our little munchkin.</i>

57:33.618 --> 57:37.496
<i>Oh, and your mother called again. I think
she's coming for dinner tomorrow...</i>

57:50.034 --> 57:52.704
What makes a man like you?

57:52.904 --> 57:55.807
You know, we're not as lucky
as your Ronnie boy.

57:55.907 --> 57:58.209
Stop saying that name.

57:58.509 --> 58:01.312
Ronnie boy? Why?

58:01.412 --> 58:04.099
Ronnie boy's a good guy.

58:04.199 --> 58:07.778
I'm sure he misses you so much.

58:08.686 --> 58:11.327
I'm gonna end this.

58:11.427 --> 58:13.291
You are?

58:13.391 --> 58:17.829
You're gonna end your little
fucked up revenge thing?

58:18.129 --> 58:20.015
Good.

58:20.849 --> 58:25.169
But the truth is,
you killed those girls.

58:25.269 --> 58:27.072
I guess it was your fault.

58:27.472 --> 58:29.692
You could have avoided all that.

58:31.175 --> 58:34.913
You should have shared your food
a little more at least or...

58:35.013 --> 58:38.000
that one in the corner?

58:38.750 --> 58:41.337
You can't blame me for that.

58:44.589 --> 58:47.476
Definitely your fault.

58:49.260 --> 58:51.129
It's over.

58:51.229 --> 58:53.649
It's not over.

58:55.600 --> 58:59.914
You have no idea
what you're dealing with.

59:01.005 --> 59:03.860
Not even close.

59:04.325 --> 59:07.409
Not until you see the next house.

59:08.446 --> 59:13.204
You... are really gonna love
the next house.

01:00:23.154 --> 01:00:25.607
Don't fucking move.

01:00:31.796 --> 01:00:33.349
Ronnie?

01:00:42.206 --> 01:00:44.202
What the fuck is going on here?

01:00:44.742 --> 01:00:48.799
You're alive!
I was looking everywhere for you.

01:00:56.454 --> 01:00:59.688
God. God, you're covered in blood.

01:01:01.726 --> 01:01:04.069
Do you need an ambulance?
Are you okay? Are you bleeding?

01:01:04.169 --> 01:01:06.946
- I'll call the police.
- Don't fucking move!

01:01:07.932 --> 01:01:11.603
Okay, easy, baby.
Everything's gonna be okay.

01:01:11.703 --> 01:01:13.605
Put the gun down.

01:01:13.805 --> 01:01:16.158
You're safe here.

01:01:17.108 --> 01:01:18.994
Okay?

01:01:20.611 --> 01:01:23.648
- Why are you here?
- Eve.

01:01:23.748 --> 01:01:26.568
Why are you here? This isn't your house.

01:01:30.221 --> 01:01:32.991
- Why does he know you?
- What do you mean?

01:01:33.091 --> 01:01:36.645
He keeps saying your name all the time.
Do you know him?

01:01:39.697 --> 01:01:41.299
Eve...

01:01:41.399 --> 01:01:44.402
I spent six months looking for you.

01:01:44.702 --> 01:01:46.671
I lost my job.

01:01:46.771 --> 01:01:50.541
I spent everything I had.
I lost my home.

01:01:50.641 --> 01:01:53.211
Eve, what happened to you?

01:01:53.311 --> 01:01:55.717
Tell me what's going on.

01:01:56.180 --> 01:01:58.033
I...

01:01:59.450 --> 01:02:01.703
I escaped.

01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:04.722
Baby, come here.

01:02:04.822 --> 01:02:07.623
Everything's gonna be fine. Put...

01:02:08.092 --> 01:02:11.346
Just... they're not gonna
hurt you anymore.

01:02:14.632 --> 01:02:16.668
I was kidnapped.

01:02:17.168 --> 01:02:18.789
They...

01:02:18.889 --> 01:02:21.734
they did things to me. They...

01:02:21.834 --> 01:02:25.830
Hey. Just come sit down. Alright?

01:02:38.656 --> 01:02:40.658
- What the fuck was that?
- Easy, easy.

01:02:40.758 --> 01:02:43.779
- What the fuck was that?
- Easy.

01:02:44.195 --> 01:02:46.748
Okay. Just...

01:02:47.798 --> 01:02:50.620
I'm sorry, I... I met someone.

01:02:53.871 --> 01:02:56.467
Honestly. I thought that I'd never...

01:02:57.408 --> 01:02:59.161
Show me.

01:03:04.115 --> 01:03:06.135
What the fuck is that?

01:03:07.418 --> 01:03:09.938
What are these pictures?

01:03:16.094 --> 01:03:19.264
Alright. Hold on. Let me explain...

01:03:19.364 --> 01:03:21.984
Then fucking start talking!

01:03:25.269 --> 01:03:27.795
You were gone for a long time.

01:03:27.895 --> 01:03:31.577
I searched for you.
The police... they didn't help.

01:03:33.077 --> 01:03:37.098
Okay, there were more girls
that disappeared, like you.

01:03:37.782 --> 01:03:41.337
And I went to look for them
to look for you.

01:03:42.954 --> 01:03:45.890
And I... Eve...

01:03:45.990 --> 01:03:49.510
But I couldn't... I couldn't find you.

01:03:50.661 --> 01:03:53.822
Look at me. Stop. I already searched
the photos. There's nothing in there

01:03:53.922 --> 01:03:56.752
that you won't find that I already
have gone through. Let's just get...

01:03:58.636 --> 01:04:00.656
Who is she?

01:04:11.682 --> 01:04:13.915
I told you.

01:04:14.385 --> 01:04:16.738
I met someone.

01:04:22.093 --> 01:04:25.017
Katrina. Is this the girl you met?

01:04:29.233 --> 01:04:32.528
- That's how he knows you, right?
- Eve.

01:04:34.839 --> 01:04:37.475
- Move.
- What... what can I do?

01:04:37.575 --> 01:04:40.551
- What can I do?
- Open the door.

01:04:40.651 --> 01:04:43.064
No, don't do this.

01:04:43.164 --> 01:04:45.316
I'll do anything.

01:04:45.416 --> 01:04:46.951
- What can I do?
- Move.

01:04:47.051 --> 01:04:50.501
Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.

01:04:50.601 --> 01:04:54.094
- Wait...
- Open the door.

01:04:56.660 --> 01:04:59.173
Open the fucking door.

01:05:07.338 --> 01:05:08.656
Goddammit!

01:05:23.003 --> 01:05:24.924
Turn the lights on.

01:06:05.229 --> 01:06:07.015
Eve...

01:06:10.868 --> 01:06:12.978
It wasn't personal.

01:06:13.078 --> 01:06:15.373
Say your name
for the camera and your age.

01:06:15.473 --> 01:06:17.525
- Why?
- Come on, please?

01:06:17.625 --> 01:06:19.910
- Why?
- You're just... you're just so beautiful.

01:06:20.010 --> 01:06:22.366
But could you smile at least
a little more? There you go.

01:06:22.466 --> 01:06:24.924
- Look like you're having some fun.
- What...

01:08:50.995 --> 01:08:53.363
Kids, never point a gun at anybody else.

01:08:53.464 --> 01:08:57.479
It's a bad thing. Now, don't... Oh, wait.
Come on. Come on, give it back.

01:09:06.377 --> 01:09:09.078
I guess I have your boyfriend
to thank for that.

01:09:09.179 --> 01:09:11.415
Yeah, you knew him pretty well, right?

01:09:11.515 --> 01:09:13.651
What were his last words?

01:09:13.751 --> 01:09:18.322
- Tell me what you want. I'll do anything.
- Yeah, I need something.

01:09:18.421 --> 01:09:20.725
His last words were an address.

01:09:20.825 --> 01:09:25.080
- I need an address.
- Okay. I'll give you whatever you want.

01:09:25.496 --> 01:09:27.849
The final house.

01:09:28.999 --> 01:09:31.085
Oh, what's...

01:09:35.538 --> 01:09:37.908
What the... what the hell are you doing?

01:09:38.008 --> 01:09:40.728
- One more stop.
- No.

01:09:41.028 --> 01:09:42.764
Don't do that.

01:09:43.413 --> 01:09:47.032
I'll do anything you want.
Don't do it. Don't do it.

01:09:47.131 --> 01:09:49.587
Please! Don't take me there.

01:09:49.687 --> 01:09:52.607
Don't take me there. Please!

01:10:07.505 --> 01:10:09.957
Don't you understand?

01:10:11.308 --> 01:10:14.062
You can't do this.

01:10:15.579 --> 01:10:19.462
I won't tell them anything if you...
if you don't stop this.

01:10:20.484 --> 01:10:24.872
And there's girls out there. There's
so many girls out there just like you.

01:10:24.972 --> 01:10:26.534
And they're scared.

01:10:30.544 --> 01:10:32.580
And they're hurt...

01:10:32.830 --> 01:10:35.020
and they need your help.

01:10:35.966 --> 01:10:39.153
This is bigger than me and you.

01:10:39.436 --> 01:10:41.405
And you can save them.

01:10:41.705 --> 01:10:44.013
You can do this.

01:10:46.810 --> 01:10:48.379
But you gotta stop.

01:10:48.479 --> 01:10:52.401
You gotta stop what you're doing.
I know what you're doing. Goddammit!

01:10:59.690 --> 01:11:03.527
I'll give you the names.
I'll... I'll give you money.

01:11:03.627 --> 01:11:06.206
All my contacts.

01:11:13.203 --> 01:11:15.156
Please.

01:11:17.041 --> 01:11:19.694
I'm begging you.

01:11:20.978 --> 01:11:23.074
I'm begging you now.

01:11:25.883 --> 01:11:28.236
Don't do this.

01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:31.692
It wasn't personal.

01:11:31.792 --> 01:11:34.237
It wasn't personal.

01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:21.306
Phil! What happened, Phil?

01:12:22.306 --> 01:12:26.000
No! Oh, my God. What happened?

01:12:26.310 --> 01:12:28.808
What happened, Phil?

01:12:30.587 --> 01:12:35.690
Oh, my God! Phil! Oh, my God.
Are you alright? Look at me.

01:15:06.670 --> 01:15:09.309
I bought the vegetables you wanted.

01:15:09.887 --> 01:15:13.333
I cooked the soup like you like it.

01:15:15.579 --> 01:15:17.948
And it's all for you.

01:15:18.048 --> 01:15:20.684
There's no reason to share anymore.

01:15:20.984 --> 01:15:23.365
It's for you.

01:15:27.658 --> 01:15:30.977
You don't have to worry
about your sister...

01:15:31.904 --> 01:15:34.061
anymore.

01:15:35.232 --> 01:15:37.819
Not anymore.

01:16:23.447 --> 01:16:25.382
Yeah.

01:16:25.482 --> 01:16:28.252
- So how was your trip?
- It was awesome.

01:16:28.352 --> 01:16:31.155
Completely changed my perspective.
Europe will do that to you.

01:16:31.255 --> 01:16:34.191
Yeah. So what's next, college or what?

01:16:34.291 --> 01:16:37.127
I don't know.
There's so much stuff I want to do.

01:16:37.227 --> 01:16:39.496
For right now I'm just gonna focus
on having fun.

01:16:39.596 --> 01:16:41.631
- Well, I'm happy you're back.
- I'm so happy.

01:16:41.731 --> 01:16:44.769
This is just so cute.
Why don't you give her a kiss.

01:16:45.369 --> 01:16:48.038
Cool. Alright, now make out.

01:16:48.138 --> 01:16:51.408
What? That's so gross.
So gross. That's gross.

01:16:51.508 --> 01:16:53.698
Okay. Alright. Okay.
Fine, I'll give it to you.

01:16:53.798 --> 01:16:56.013
- This is my sister.
- Alright, so Dylan...

01:16:56.113 --> 01:16:58.882
you just look at the camera,
give me your name and age...

01:16:58.982 --> 01:17:02.623
My name's Dylan, I'm 19
and I finished high school. Happy?

01:17:02.723 --> 01:17:06.356
- Yes. Not... Come on.
- Okay, now it's your turn.

01:17:06.456 --> 01:17:09.626
- Give that. Yeah, that's not funny.
