00:01.040 --> 00:04.118
Could you imagine?
Dying like that?

00:04.120 --> 00:06.918
Choking on fumes in your car?

00:06.920 --> 00:09.798
-What a waste.
-And with gas as expensive as it is.

00:09.800 --> 00:13.560
You know, that's true.
It was three dollars the other day.

00:14.640 --> 00:17.840
My name is Ms. Margie King
from the State Board of Education.

00:20.240 --> 00:21.840
Heather McNamara, dead.

00:22.640 --> 00:23.960
Ram Sweeney, dead.

00:24.800 --> 00:26.520
Mr. Waters, dead.

00:27.480 --> 00:31.358
Heather Chandler, almost dead.
Betty Finn, assaulted.

00:31.360 --> 00:34.918
Lizzy Jackson brought a gun to school.
Heather Duke, another gun in school.

00:34.920 --> 00:36.918
That was a prop.

00:36.920 --> 00:41.238
Suicide. Murder. Assault. Pedophilia.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.438
Tomorrow, you have your annual
school shooter drill,

00:43.440 --> 00:45.238
but that's not enough.

00:45.240 --> 00:48.558
-Westerburg High is under siege.
-That's right.

00:48.560 --> 00:52.360
And we at the State Board of Education
have the solution.

00:55.200 --> 00:57.718
The only way to stop
a bad guy with a gun

00:57.720 --> 00:59.318
is a good guy with a gun.

00:59.320 --> 01:02.318
Starting today, all teachers
in Westerburg High

01:02.320 --> 01:04.197
will be required to pack heat.

01:04.200 --> 01:07.080
Guns... in school.

01:08.320 --> 01:11.518
-I miss Tampa.
-The fact that we are even entertaining

01:11.520 --> 01:14.718
what is the most asinine idea
I've ever heard,

01:14.720 --> 01:19.758
just proves how far our nation
has strayed from love.

01:19.760 --> 01:22.078
Violence must not be met with violence.

01:22.080 --> 01:23.640
Violence must be met with love.

01:24.520 --> 01:27.998
-Mahatma Gandhi.
-Mahatma Gandhi. Also dead.

01:28.000 --> 01:30.598
Now carrying a firearm, Ms. Fleming,

01:30.600 --> 01:33.918
is not a suggestion,
it is a requirement.

01:33.920 --> 01:36.358
All teachers will be required

01:36.360 --> 01:39.398
to keep a loaded firearm in
their desk drawers at all times.

01:39.400 --> 01:41.838
-Sorry, loaded?
-Loaded.

01:41.840 --> 01:43.638
-In our desk.
-Drawers.

01:43.640 --> 01:45.478
This is truly insane.

01:45.480 --> 01:47.078
You know, I have to agree with Pauline.

01:47.080 --> 01:49.158
-I'm sorry, a gun in my desk?
-Yeah.

01:49.160 --> 01:51.038
What am I gonna do with my pencils?

01:51.040 --> 01:54.038
I have an idea.
You can put your pencils in a mug.

01:54.040 --> 01:57.998
A mug?
What kind of trash do you think I am?

01:58.000 --> 02:01.558
Mandatory firearm training
begins this afternoon.

02:01.560 --> 02:05.398
Be there or we'll be glad to accept
your resignation.

02:05.400 --> 02:07.798
Your choice. And remember...

02:07.800 --> 02:10.198
You're teachers.

02:10.199 --> 02:12.878
It is your job to protect those kids.

02:12.880 --> 02:15.118
And the best way to do that...

02:15.120 --> 02:18.598
is to be ready, willing and able...

02:18.600 --> 02:19.960
to take them down.

02:29.760 --> 02:31.320
Good job.

02:35.760 --> 02:39.238
You know, to be honest,
I thought this was a terrible idea.

02:39.240 --> 02:41.680
but I'm actually having
a really great time.

02:51.520 --> 02:53.918
I hate to say I told you so, but...

02:53.920 --> 02:55.520
It is what it is.

03:43.080 --> 03:44.600
"Still standing."

03:46.080 --> 03:48.598
I swear, if you spring one of those
elaborate promposals on me,

03:48.600 --> 03:50.198
I'll kill you myself.

03:50.200 --> 03:51.838
You'd have to put me
back in the crazy bin

03:51.840 --> 03:53.720
to get me to buy
into that humanitarian crisis.

03:55.560 --> 03:57.440
Wait, you don't actually want to go,
do you?

03:58.680 --> 04:00.558
No, I mean, I just...

04:00.560 --> 04:03.120
It would be like, the last thing
other people would expect.

04:04.000 --> 04:06.878
-You want to go to prom.
-No, I don't.

04:06.880 --> 04:08.360
But if I were to ask you?

04:09.360 --> 04:11.358
I was thinking we could go like...

04:11.360 --> 04:12.800
as a joke.

04:15.000 --> 04:18.278
Veronica...
prom is slavery.

04:18.279 --> 04:21.838
This is one of the many steps on
our path towards becoming grist

04:21.839 --> 04:24.198
for the mill of corporations.

04:24.200 --> 04:25.758
I mean, dresses?

04:25.760 --> 04:27.918
Flowers, promposals.

04:27.920 --> 04:30.638
They're training us to breed like rats.

04:30.640 --> 04:34.240
Because as soon as we have kids
that rely on us, they've got us trapped.

04:36.360 --> 04:39.638
But slavery only works if the slave
has something to lose.

04:39.640 --> 04:44.480
And I, my dear, don't ever intend
to have anything to lose.

04:46.040 --> 04:48.398
God, it's just prom, JD.

04:48.400 --> 04:50.278
Veronica, last night.

04:50.280 --> 04:51.720
We need to talk.

04:57.240 --> 04:58.718
Heather, what is wrong?

04:58.720 --> 05:01.278
She knows. Heather. Heather knows.

05:01.280 --> 05:03.960
She knows what?
What are you talking about?

05:05.000 --> 05:06.880
Hello, purse turds.

05:09.920 --> 05:13.278
I can't believe they make us do this
stupid active shooter drill every year.

05:13.280 --> 05:15.078
Last year, you got to go to Heaven.

05:15.080 --> 05:17.838
If you survive, you have to go to
the Thoughts and Prayers Room.

05:17.840 --> 05:19.838
The snacks are way better in Heaven.

05:19.840 --> 05:21.358
What kind of snacks do they have?

05:21.360 --> 05:23.598
They literally have like,
a cotton candy machine,

05:23.600 --> 05:25.918
popcorn, chips, everything delicious.

05:25.920 --> 05:27.398
I can't eat any of them.

05:27.400 --> 05:29.278
You could starve yourself before
if you want.

05:29.280 --> 05:32.680
-I'll just not eat it.
-I gained like, 10 pounds--

05:35.800 --> 05:37.758
<i>Students and faculty, in a few moments</i>

05:37.760 --> 05:40.280
<i>we'll be starting our annual</i>
<i>active shooter drill.</i>

05:41.280 --> 05:43.120
<i>The school is now on lockdown.</i>

05:44.000 --> 05:47.720
<i>Please head directly to the nearest</i>
<i>classroom and lock the door.</i>

05:48.560 --> 05:50.078
No!

05:50.080 --> 05:51.678
<i>At the conclusion of this announcement,</i>

05:51.680 --> 05:55.080
<i>the shooter will begin to go</i>
<i>from classroom to classroom.</i>

05:56.280 --> 05:59.478
<i>Thank you for your cooperation</i>
<i>and good luck.</i>

05:59.480 --> 06:01.878
<i>An active shooter</i>
<i>is now in the building.</i>

06:01.880 --> 06:04.840
<i>I repeat, an active shooter</i>
<i>is now in the building.</i>

06:39.760 --> 06:41.558
<i>Mr. Dennis to the office.</i>

06:41.560 --> 06:43.240
<i>Your mother is on line one.</i>

06:59.040 --> 07:02.000
When is he gonna kill us? I am so bored.

07:05.240 --> 07:07.278
Who here is a Christian?

07:07.280 --> 07:08.998
If we say yes, do we get killed?

07:09.000 --> 07:12.320
Yes, because I'm an active shooter,
and I hate God.

07:13.440 --> 07:14.958
Bang, bang.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.080
You're dead, bang, bang.

07:18.760 --> 07:20.638
The rest of you survived.

07:20.640 --> 07:23.798
Now that I have you hostage,
what will you do next, teens?

07:23.800 --> 07:25.878
Call the police?

07:25.880 --> 07:28.238
Great idea.
But guess what?

07:28.240 --> 07:31.398
A smart active shooter would have
blocked off Old Schoolhouse Road

07:31.400 --> 07:33.798
so that the Sherwood Police
would have to go all the way around

07:33.800 --> 07:35.278
to New Schoolhouse Road.

07:35.280 --> 07:38.558
God forbid he figure out
all the hiding spots in Westerburg

07:38.560 --> 07:40.160
that no one else knows about.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.358
He could hide in the air conditioning
duct in B Hall.

07:44.360 --> 07:47.758
He could hide in that janitor's closet
that the city condemned.

07:47.760 --> 07:50.358
He could hide in
that senior smoking lounge

07:50.360 --> 07:52.238
that's been bricked over for years.

07:52.240 --> 07:54.320
That's just the tip of the iceberg.

07:56.120 --> 07:59.240
Now, Coach Cox will usher you
to your next room.

08:00.800 --> 08:02.160
Don't be a hero.

08:06.920 --> 08:09.200
Okay, survivors. Follow me.

08:15.960 --> 08:18.038
<i>Bleach your hair, Heather.</i>

08:18.040 --> 08:20.038
Change your name.

08:20.040 --> 08:24.678
Buy a plane ticket to Mexico,
but like, the dusty part,

08:24.680 --> 08:27.800
because your life... is... over.

08:29.200 --> 08:30.520
Heather...

08:33.039 --> 08:34.717
This will ruin me.

08:34.720 --> 08:38.638
You should have thought of that.
You both should have.

08:38.640 --> 08:41.798
No, Heather, come on.
You do not have to do this.

08:41.799 --> 08:44.118
Heather was just...

08:44.120 --> 08:46.358
an innocent bystander.

08:46.360 --> 08:48.758
Veronica, just because
Heather was a child actor,

08:48.760 --> 08:51.760
doesn't mean she shouldn't be
held accountable for her hate crimes.

08:53.440 --> 08:55.080
What are you talking about?

08:56.720 --> 08:58.358
Okay.

08:58.360 --> 09:01.320
Don't judge me. I was a child.

09:02.800 --> 09:04.120
Checkmate.

09:09.720 --> 09:11.918
<i>Conversion therapy saved my marriage.</i>

09:11.920 --> 09:14.078
<i>Now I can focus on what really matters.</i>

09:14.080 --> 09:16.638
<i>Like digging wells for the poor</i>
<i>in Guatemala.</i>

09:16.640 --> 09:19.360
<i>Conversion therapy. It just works.</i>

09:21.120 --> 09:22.480
Oh, my God.

09:23.480 --> 09:24.958
This?

09:24.960 --> 09:29.638
This video is what was supposed
to ruin Heather's life?

09:29.640 --> 09:34.438
Veronica, she's literally advocating
for the torture of the queer community.

09:34.440 --> 09:36.318
Veronica, do something!

09:36.320 --> 09:39.758
About what? Some stupid commercial
you made when you were a kid?

09:39.760 --> 09:45.518
Honestly, there are more important
things to obsess over than yourself.

09:45.520 --> 09:47.558
Like, if you haven't noticed,

09:47.560 --> 09:49.558
shit is really messed up
here at Westerburg.

09:49.560 --> 09:53.838
Like, the theme of our prom this year
is "Still Standing."

09:53.840 --> 09:56.878
The world is just going to hell
and nobody seems to care.

09:56.880 --> 10:00.878
Our parents don't care,
our teachers do not care.

10:00.880 --> 10:02.838
And worst of all...

10:02.840 --> 10:05.078
And worst of all,

10:05.080 --> 10:06.838
we don't even care.

10:06.840 --> 10:12.398
So, honestly, let's just try
to make it out alive,

10:12.400 --> 10:15.080
and then go our separate ways.

10:16.360 --> 10:17.998
-Calm down.
-Calm down.

10:18.000 --> 10:20.720
-Oh, my God. Jinx much?
-Jinx much?

10:21.640 --> 10:23.238
-You know what, Heather?
-What's that, Heather?

10:23.240 --> 10:25.878
Veronica's little seizure just now
made me realize something.

10:25.880 --> 10:28.758
I didn't even make it through the end.
What did she say?

10:28.760 --> 10:30.798
It truly doesn't matter. The point is,

10:30.800 --> 10:33.278
even though you've literally
tried to destroy me

10:33.280 --> 10:35.678
-in every imaginable way...
-And you me.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.480
Okay. Okay.

10:38.760 --> 10:40.080
We're friends.

10:41.560 --> 10:44.278
Oh, my God.
That's your big epiphany?

10:44.280 --> 10:47.278
You are both so fucking shallow.

10:47.280 --> 10:51.358
Like, you told me that your life
was going to be ruined

10:51.360 --> 10:53.398
because of something that happened
last night and I thought

10:53.400 --> 10:55.200
-that you remembered--
-Excuse me?

10:56.040 --> 10:57.360
Wait.

10:58.440 --> 11:01.280
Last night. Wait.

11:04.320 --> 11:06.200
Veronica, I need a grilled cheese!

11:10.040 --> 11:11.520
Hey, freaks.

11:15.800 --> 11:17.240
I just remembered something.

11:20.920 --> 11:22.440
Something horrifying.

11:25.400 --> 11:26.960
Something huge.

11:31.640 --> 11:33.040
It's all coming back to me.

11:34.880 --> 11:38.000
-Heather...
-Last night, Veronica...

11:39.280 --> 11:40.800
brought her boyfriend.

11:43.040 --> 11:45.920
-To a girls' night!
-Oh, my God.

11:53.520 --> 11:57.358
Coach Cox, what if you're
not in a classroom

11:57.360 --> 11:59.678
when an active shooter attacks?

11:59.680 --> 12:01.678
Try to make your way to the cafeteria.

12:01.680 --> 12:04.038
No one knows this, but there's
a boiler room under it.

12:04.040 --> 12:06.118
You can all hide in there too.

12:06.120 --> 12:09.718
And the guns, every teacher has one
in their desk, right?

12:09.720 --> 12:12.718
Yes, and if you find yourself
in a classroom without a teacher,

12:12.720 --> 12:15.038
by all means,
grab that gun and fire away.

12:15.040 --> 12:17.558
Of course, none of you are the type
to shoot up a school.

12:17.560 --> 12:20.878
They tend to be white men, usually from
middle to upper middle-class families,

12:20.880 --> 12:23.920
socially isolated, angry,
usually pretty intelligent.

12:25.080 --> 12:27.640
I have a question, Coach.

12:28.600 --> 12:32.118
I get why you guys are doing
this school shooter drill and all,

12:32.120 --> 12:36.358
but like, wouldn't common sense
sort of dictate that like,

12:36.360 --> 12:40.878
such a drill would actually
be showing a potential perpetrator

12:40.880 --> 12:44.280
exactly how to shoot up a school?

12:46.520 --> 12:48.120
You're high.

12:56.000 --> 12:57.878
Guys, let's go.

12:57.880 --> 13:00.798
One of your classmates
is trying to kill you.

13:00.800 --> 13:03.038
Let's get a look at that boiler room.

13:03.040 --> 13:05.400
Gonna see how a sick, twisted killer
is made.

13:14.760 --> 13:16.200
Follow me.

13:18.240 --> 13:19.760
Okay. You.

13:21.080 --> 13:22.878
Yeah, you. Come on up, big guy.

13:22.880 --> 13:24.200
Oh, God.

13:25.000 --> 13:27.960
Okay, how many of you
know this guy's name?

13:30.600 --> 13:33.118
Really? Kyle.

13:33.120 --> 13:35.078
I want to say Darmand?

13:35.080 --> 13:38.318
You-- It's Dylen.
Dylen Lutz.

13:38.320 --> 13:42.118
Right. Now, Dylen looks totally
non-threatening, right?

13:42.120 --> 13:46.038
Nine out of ten times you'd walk
right past him without even noticing.

13:46.040 --> 13:48.998
Those can be the most dangerous type.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.960
Now, look at this.

14:01.920 --> 14:03.598
Go ahead, point the gun at somebody.

14:03.600 --> 14:05.958
-I don't think--
-No, don't be bashful.

14:05.960 --> 14:07.360
Okay.

14:17.720 --> 14:19.798
Dylen's here.

14:19.800 --> 14:21.278
Bitch.

14:21.280 --> 14:23.280
What do you think of Dylen now?

14:24.480 --> 14:26.200
Great. Thank you, Dylen.

14:28.240 --> 14:30.560
Is it just me or is Dylen Lutz like,
really hot?

14:32.040 --> 14:33.718
Okay, guys, focus up.

14:33.720 --> 14:35.238
Now what did we learn here?

14:35.240 --> 14:38.238
Just because someone looks cool as hell,

14:38.240 --> 14:41.118
like a modern-day
James Dean or something,

14:41.120 --> 14:45.438
and just seems smarter and more evolved
than any student you've ever met,

14:45.440 --> 14:48.080
doesn't mean they won't rain death
upon us all.

14:50.920 --> 14:52.398
Yes.

14:52.400 --> 14:57.438
Do you think in a society that like,
values fame above all else

14:57.440 --> 15:02.158
that like, treating these students
like misunderstood masterminds

15:02.160 --> 15:07.080
provides a blueprint for lost kids
to feel like, important?

15:10.840 --> 15:12.680
God, you are such a lesbo.

15:15.360 --> 15:16.840
Just follow me.

15:22.600 --> 15:26.520
I was having a perfectly nice blackout
until JD showed up for no reason.

15:28.920 --> 15:31.078
I mean, that's what you remember?

15:31.080 --> 15:32.918
-Yeah.
-God. No.

15:32.920 --> 15:37.438
No, JD was just in the area and
he wanted to stop by. So what?

15:37.440 --> 15:41.358
So what?
So, you can't go one single night

15:41.360 --> 15:43.678
without your domestic
terrorist boyfriend.

15:43.680 --> 15:45.878
Once again, you ditch us for a guy.

15:45.880 --> 15:48.398
Oh, my God, I have not ditched you guys.

15:48.400 --> 15:50.158
Yes, you have, Veronica.

15:50.160 --> 15:53.398
God! This was our senior year.

15:53.400 --> 15:55.918
We had plans. We were supposed to get
matching tattoos.

15:55.920 --> 15:57.718
And finally take you to a salon.

15:57.720 --> 16:00.558
-You know what I think, Heather?
-What's that, Heather?

16:00.560 --> 16:02.438
I'm just gonna say it.

16:02.440 --> 16:04.798
I think Veronica's a BFF.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.198
That's Bad Female Friend.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.638
She dropped us at the first sign
of boner smoke.

16:10.640 --> 16:12.318
And even after JD assaulted me,

16:12.320 --> 16:14.838
she still can't pry the Anarchist
Cookbook out of her trank.

16:14.840 --> 16:17.438
-Heather, she's toxic.
-She's dick-metized.

16:17.440 --> 16:19.918
She's the reason we keep failing
the Bechdel Test.

16:19.920 --> 16:22.438
Come to think of it, Heather,
we never fought

16:22.440 --> 16:24.638
until Veronica picked up that parasite.

16:24.640 --> 16:26.318
You had never hit me with a car before.

16:26.320 --> 16:27.798
-I know.
-You know what I think?

16:27.800 --> 16:29.278
Here we go.

16:29.280 --> 16:31.720
Veronica Sawyer has found her voice.

16:34.680 --> 16:36.558
I think...

16:36.560 --> 16:40.318
that you are jealous, Heather.

16:40.320 --> 16:43.998
And who am I supposed to be jealous of,
Veronica?

16:44.000 --> 16:45.320
You?

16:47.280 --> 16:50.518
Oh, I'm right, aren't I?

16:50.520 --> 16:55.520
You're jealous because you couldn't
get a boyfriend even if you tried.

16:58.440 --> 17:00.600
I can have anyone I want at Westerburg.

17:01.440 --> 17:03.438
Then why don't you?

17:03.440 --> 17:05.480
Because I choose not to.

17:06.880 --> 17:08.358
Is that it, Heather?

17:08.359 --> 17:12.518
Because every time one of your friends
starts dating someone,

17:12.520 --> 17:14.998
you always try to sabotage it.

17:15.000 --> 17:17.518
Like, remember Kurt,
the guy Heather's dating?

17:17.520 --> 17:18.998
-Who?
-Wait, I'm sorry.

17:19.000 --> 17:22.718
Was dating, because you made Heather
dump him.

17:22.720 --> 17:25.358
-Oh, yeah.
-I was helping you, Heather.

17:25.359 --> 17:28.998
-Kurt was a total 401k.
-He's not that bad, Heather.

17:29.000 --> 17:31.158
Kurt has a favorite commercial, Heather.

17:31.160 --> 17:35.518
Oh, my God.
You guys are both so obsessed

17:35.520 --> 17:39.158
with what other people think of you
that you wouldn't be able to imagine

17:39.160 --> 17:42.438
what it's like to actually
be with someone.

17:42.440 --> 17:47.078
Like, to adjust your own wants and needs
to match those of a person

17:47.080 --> 17:49.478
that you love and that you care about,

17:49.480 --> 17:52.278
so that you can
challenge each other to be

17:52.280 --> 17:54.960
better, stronger versions of yourselves.

17:59.880 --> 18:01.600
Maybe I'll just read about it, then.

18:03.040 --> 18:04.720
She got your journal, bitch.

18:09.280 --> 18:10.918
We've seen an active shooter.

18:10.920 --> 18:13.518
We've seen how a killer gets made.

18:13.520 --> 18:16.758
And now, let's see how she...

18:16.760 --> 18:18.520
could have stopped it.

18:28.000 --> 18:29.320
Teens.

18:30.440 --> 18:34.478
So often in times of tragedy
we find ourselves saying,

18:34.480 --> 18:37.160
"I just wish there's something
I could have done."

18:38.960 --> 18:40.760
Well, maybe there was.

18:42.240 --> 18:43.998
Childhood.

18:44.000 --> 18:46.640
Mommy, is dinner ready?

18:47.720 --> 18:49.598
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

18:49.600 --> 18:51.238
I'm late for the night shift.

18:51.240 --> 18:53.038
You've worked every night this week.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.918
None of my friends' moms have jobs.

18:55.920 --> 18:59.358
I wish I had a home-cooked meal.

18:59.360 --> 19:04.078
I'm just doing the best I can
since your father left us.

19:04.080 --> 19:05.680
Freeze!

19:07.720 --> 19:11.278
Working when she should have been
at home raising her children.

19:11.280 --> 19:13.560
She could have stopped it.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.478
Hey, cool guy,
I heard you were tutoring.

19:17.480 --> 19:19.598
I need some help with my anatomy test.

19:19.600 --> 19:21.438
How much do you charge?

19:21.440 --> 19:23.998
A boy's sexual advances
can drive him to rage.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.878
-Hands off, creep.
-See what I mean?

19:26.880 --> 19:29.998
-She could have stopped it.
-Hey, that's inappropriate.

19:30.000 --> 19:31.558
She could have stopped it.

19:31.560 --> 19:34.158
You know, and another thing about me...

19:34.160 --> 19:36.438
-Hey!
-They should be castrated.

19:36.440 --> 19:39.400
-Okay.
-She could have stopped it.

20:02.720 --> 20:06.118
I can't believe I didn't get killed
this year. I hate this.

20:06.120 --> 20:08.758
In Heaven I bet they don't assume
everyone eats peanut butter

20:08.760 --> 20:10.358
with sugar in it.

20:10.360 --> 20:13.998
I mean, I don't get why somebody
who wanted to kill people

20:14.000 --> 20:18.118
wouldn't just wait until everybody
was together, right?

20:18.120 --> 20:20.798
I mean, yeah, you'd save yourself
a lot of running around

20:20.800 --> 20:23.438
if you waited for an assembly
or something.

20:23.440 --> 20:24.920
Or a prom.

20:26.000 --> 20:30.038
-Can you imagine?
-That would be so gnarly, like,

20:30.040 --> 20:32.760
blood and corsages everywhere.

20:35.120 --> 20:38.918
"I was never that kind of girl
who was into fairytales."

20:38.920 --> 20:41.998
Internalized misogyny, of course.

20:42.000 --> 20:43.678
Nothing about me, boring.

20:43.680 --> 20:45.478
Nothing about me, boring.

20:45.480 --> 20:47.758
Nothing about me, boring.

20:47.760 --> 20:49.120
Heather, listen to this.

20:50.440 --> 20:53.278
"Heather Duke asked me to double
with her and Kurt tonight,

20:53.280 --> 20:55.478
and honestly, I think I might do it.

20:55.480 --> 20:57.598
Even though the very thought of it
makes me feel like

20:57.600 --> 20:59.880
I'm getting a triple root canal."

21:02.560 --> 21:03.960
Listen to this.

21:05.000 --> 21:07.718
"Heather Chandler told me that
in order to be irreplaceable

21:07.720 --> 21:09.638
one must always be different.

21:09.640 --> 21:11.798
I told her that's a Coco Chanel quote,

21:11.800 --> 21:15.318
and then she told me to stop being
such a basic cable bitch."

21:15.320 --> 21:18.678
God, Veronica. Of course, your journal's
just full of quotes by me.

21:18.680 --> 21:21.398
-Plagiarist.
-She's obsessed with us.

21:21.400 --> 21:24.080
Of course, she is, Heather. We're the
only thing that makes her interesting.

21:34.200 --> 21:36.720
-Heather?
-Yes, Heather?

21:50.520 --> 21:53.078
"I couldn't take it anymore.

21:53.080 --> 21:55.558
I swung my mallet into her temple,

21:55.560 --> 21:58.080
and I heard her head crack open.

21:59.000 --> 22:03.080
It was a moment before the blood started
from the part in her hair."

22:10.040 --> 22:12.720
Veronica, you're the Croquet Killer?

22:19.640 --> 22:23.438
Oh, my God.
She even saved a lock of her hair.

22:23.440 --> 22:26.758
-This is shocking.
-I know. Lucy was rich.

22:26.760 --> 22:28.918
Why would she have split ends?

22:28.920 --> 22:30.800
Veronica Sawyer.

22:33.320 --> 22:36.838
Who knew all this time you were
scribbling in your little diary,

22:36.840 --> 22:39.558
you were confessing to murder.

22:39.560 --> 22:43.318
And you just like, carried around
the murder evidence at school?

22:43.320 --> 22:48.158
-You dumbass.
-All this time you've acted so innocent.

22:48.160 --> 22:51.720
But in reality,
you're a full-blown psycho.

22:54.920 --> 22:58.120
-Maybe I am.
-You're not gonna deny it?

22:59.200 --> 23:00.760
We'll crucify you.

23:03.080 --> 23:05.758
Why should I, Heather?

23:05.760 --> 23:09.040
It's the truth.
And now you know.

23:10.400 --> 23:11.878
So, go ahead.

23:11.880 --> 23:14.038
Expose me.

23:14.040 --> 23:16.600
Ruin me. Send me to jail.

23:17.480 --> 23:20.040
I don't even care anymore.

23:21.920 --> 23:24.438
Don't be so dramatic, Veronica.
You're not going to jail.

23:24.440 --> 23:27.398
What are you talking about?
She's dangerous.

23:27.400 --> 23:29.118
She tried to kill me too.

23:29.120 --> 23:31.398
Yeah, well, you were probably
being a mega-bitch.

23:31.400 --> 23:33.800
Veronica Sawyer.

23:34.840 --> 23:37.760
You literally got away with murder.

23:40.240 --> 23:42.478
All this time I thought you were
a total home phone,

23:42.480 --> 23:44.560
but it turns out you were really just.

23:48.000 --> 23:50.998
How do you feel about being in
the Thoughts and Prayers Room?

23:51.000 --> 23:52.518
This sucks.

23:52.520 --> 23:54.918
Heaven sounds so sick.

23:54.920 --> 23:57.358
All my friends are in Heaven
and I just want to join them.

23:57.360 --> 23:59.198
This drill sucks every year.

23:59.200 --> 24:01.638
I hear in Heaven you can eat
as much as you want.

24:01.640 --> 24:03.798
I want to die.

24:03.800 --> 24:05.638
But I want to die every day, so...

24:05.640 --> 24:07.198
Honestly, if I can't wear
this trench coat

24:07.200 --> 24:09.438
and these glasses every day,
I don't want to be alive.

24:09.440 --> 24:12.080
All I wanted was
to be with Ram in Heaven.

24:13.840 --> 24:15.638
It's not fair.

24:15.640 --> 24:17.960
All the cool kids are in Heaven
and we're stuck here.

24:19.160 --> 24:22.038
So you don't care that Veronica
killed people.

24:22.040 --> 24:24.998
Calm down, Heather. We all kill people.

24:25.000 --> 24:26.800
No, we don't.

24:28.960 --> 24:30.600
You killed Heather McNamara.

24:32.000 --> 24:33.478
Excuse me?

24:33.480 --> 24:36.878
Heather would still be alive if you
hadn't julienned her at the roller rink.

24:36.880 --> 24:39.238
There, I said it.

24:39.240 --> 24:41.438
You must be confused, Heather.

24:41.440 --> 24:43.478
Didn't you post the pic
of her and Mr. Waters

24:43.480 --> 24:44.958
that started her downward spiral?

24:44.960 --> 24:47.478
Actually, I'm not quite sure.

24:47.480 --> 24:49.278
I wasn't alive at that time.

24:49.280 --> 24:51.398
Maybe you both did it.

24:51.400 --> 24:52.920
Maybe you did it, Veronica.

24:53.800 --> 24:56.998
Yeah, you and Edward Sullen probably
followed her into the bathroom

24:57.000 --> 24:59.318
and slit her wrists for her.

24:59.320 --> 25:00.800
Maybe I did.

25:03.520 --> 25:05.798
Or maybe no one did.
Maybe everybody did.

25:05.800 --> 25:10.798
Maybe we all kill people
every single day.

25:10.800 --> 25:13.798
Our cars just poison the air,
we keep driving them.

25:13.800 --> 25:17.318
Our clothes enslave people
but we keep buying them.

25:17.320 --> 25:20.518
Our trash is filling the ocean,
our burgers waste water,

25:20.520 --> 25:22.280
blah, blah, blah.

25:24.760 --> 25:26.160
-Wow.
-Wow.

25:27.000 --> 25:30.038
-JD didn't ask you to prom, did he?
-Exactly what I was thinking.

25:30.040 --> 25:31.878
What does that have to do with anything?

25:31.880 --> 25:33.560
So he didn't?

25:35.440 --> 25:37.358
JD thinks prom is slavery.

25:37.360 --> 25:40.678
Oh, my God,
he is such a clove cigarette.

25:40.680 --> 25:42.320
You know what?

25:43.760 --> 25:45.598
We should go to prom together.

25:45.600 --> 25:48.278
I can't.
You guys are gonna tell on me,

25:48.280 --> 25:50.838
and then I'm gonna spend my life
in prison.

25:50.840 --> 25:53.438
Tell on you?
This isn't daycare, Veronica.

25:53.440 --> 25:54.800
Right, Heather?

25:58.320 --> 26:01.878
While the thought of you trying to
pull off orange delights me to no end...

26:01.880 --> 26:04.680
No, we're not ratting you out.

26:07.160 --> 26:08.480
But why?

26:10.960 --> 26:12.280
Veronica...

26:14.600 --> 26:17.920
there's nothing right about you.

26:19.240 --> 26:20.718
From head to toe,

26:20.720 --> 26:23.198
from stem to stern,

26:23.200 --> 26:26.120
from that obvious wig
to those hammerhead toes.

26:27.720 --> 26:29.080
You're a monster.

26:34.880 --> 26:36.200
But you're my monster.

26:39.760 --> 26:41.200
When will you accept that?

26:42.120 --> 26:43.520
I have.

26:55.520 --> 26:57.920
So then why do we act
like we're enemies?

26:59.760 --> 27:01.238
I mean, she's right.

27:01.240 --> 27:03.278
We should be smart enough to know
that we're not the enemy.

27:03.280 --> 27:05.358
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:05.360 --> 27:07.200
The real enemy is ugly people.

27:08.160 --> 27:09.998
Guys, let's do that thing where people

27:10.000 --> 27:11.800
wrap their arms around each other
for comfort.

27:19.360 --> 27:20.878
You know what?

27:20.880 --> 27:22.958
You guys are right.

27:22.960 --> 27:25.638
We should go to prom together.

27:25.640 --> 27:30.238
-I don't need JD to have a good time.
-No.

27:30.240 --> 27:32.478
Picture the three of us
walking into prom.

27:32.480 --> 27:36.278
We'll give those nerds shower nozzle
masturbation material for months.

27:36.280 --> 27:37.838
Hell, yes.

27:37.840 --> 27:40.038
Three powerful women.

27:40.040 --> 27:43.158
Three powerful, gorgeous women.

27:43.160 --> 27:48.320
Three powerful, gorgeous, equal women.

27:49.360 --> 27:51.278
Exactly. Equal.

27:51.280 --> 27:53.558
Okay,
so here's what we're going to wear.

27:53.560 --> 27:56.598
All in the same dress,
but mine will be gold,

27:56.600 --> 27:59.358
Heather, you'll do silver,
and Veronica, you can be bronze.

27:59.360 --> 28:01.518
<i>The shooter has been neutralized.</i>

28:01.520 --> 28:03.918
<i>First period will begin at 11:35.</i>

28:03.920 --> 28:05.758
Come on.

28:05.760 --> 28:07.560
Let's go to Heaven.

28:43.800 --> 28:46.718
Ms. Fleming, you're the faculty advisor
for prom, correct?

28:46.720 --> 28:48.198
Yes.

28:48.200 --> 28:51.078
-Well, today's your lucky day.
-We are gonna plan everything.

28:51.080 --> 28:53.798
-Ready?
-We want everyone to wear all white.

28:53.800 --> 28:55.878
-Except us.
-We want a photo booth.

28:55.880 --> 28:58.878
And a VIP lounge area over there.

28:58.880 --> 29:01.798
-We'll need to blow that wall out.
-We can't do that.

29:01.800 --> 29:04.038
And we're gonna want drinks over there,
and food there.

29:04.040 --> 29:06.998
-And dessert bar...
-By the water fountain?

29:07.000 --> 29:09.878
Great idea, Veronica.
A dessert bar by the water fountain.

29:09.880 --> 29:11.598
Actually, are you getting this down?

29:11.600 --> 29:13.440
I'm sorry. Yeah.

29:14.800 --> 29:16.438
Hear me out.

29:16.440 --> 29:19.358
What if we covered every surface
with mirrors?

29:19.360 --> 29:21.638
And we could do a water feature
here in the center.

29:21.640 --> 29:23.598
And like a rotating dance floor.

29:23.600 --> 29:25.198
Amazing!

29:25.200 --> 29:28.680
Guys... we're geniuses.

29:38.880 --> 29:40.518
Well.

29:40.520 --> 29:42.598
The great minds that run Westerburg

29:42.600 --> 29:47.398
have finally solved the problem
of the violent American teenager.

29:47.400 --> 29:52.718
And in just under three hours.
Kudos to them all.

29:52.720 --> 29:56.278
Perhaps tomorrow they'll tackle
global warming over lunch.

29:56.280 --> 29:58.200
Tonight, you got any plans?

29:59.640 --> 30:02.198
Yeah, dress shopping. Sorry.

30:02.200 --> 30:04.118
Heather, Heather and I are gonna
go to prom together.

30:04.120 --> 30:06.238
-Sorry you can't make it.
-Veronica, I--

30:06.240 --> 30:10.438
No, I'm not even mad. I actually think
it will be really fun to go with them.

30:10.440 --> 30:12.360
But maybe I'll see you after prom?

30:16.680 --> 30:18.280
I've got plans too.

30:20.320 --> 30:23.360
What matters is the number of lives
we saved today.
