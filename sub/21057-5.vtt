00:36.469 --> 00:41.950
(The Lady in Dignity)

00:42.810 --> 00:44.880
Living happily with a cat like that...

00:45.049 --> 00:47.920
and the person I love...

00:48.320 --> 00:49.649
has been my wish.

00:49.750 --> 00:53.659
I saw something when I was cleaning her room.

00:54.960 --> 00:56.859
There were documents with information...

00:56.859 --> 00:59.030
on Mr. Chairman and the family members.

00:59.530 --> 01:00.530
Is it true?

01:02.729 --> 01:03.799
That can't be.

01:03.869 --> 01:06.500
She was convicted of fraud and embezzlement seven years ago.

01:06.909 --> 01:08.239
You'll have to leave.

01:08.340 --> 01:12.109
Please allow me to stay just until his birthday.

01:12.209 --> 01:15.650
I'm helping you like this now because you went to jail for me.

01:15.750 --> 01:17.780
Why are you making so much fuss over a cat?

01:17.879 --> 01:19.920
Dad's birthday party almost turned into his funeral.

01:19.980 --> 01:23.120
I can stand up like this now thanks to her.

01:23.560 --> 01:25.090
I can walk!

01:25.189 --> 01:27.129
But still, she has to go.

01:27.189 --> 01:29.090
Will Dad be okay with it though?

01:29.159 --> 01:32.230
The cat is not in the house. I threw it out.

01:36.430 --> 01:37.469
You.

01:38.739 --> 01:39.739
Get out of this house.

01:44.180 --> 01:45.310
It's pretty, isn't it?

01:46.340 --> 01:47.349
Yes.

01:47.549 --> 01:49.150
- Do you want to touch it? - Yes.

02:07.670 --> 02:11.439
It's better not to know about the things that you can't have.

03:04.460 --> 03:06.020
What on earth are you doing now?

03:07.689 --> 03:09.030
You're back.

03:09.159 --> 03:10.960
I'm asking what this is all about!

03:13.129 --> 03:16.199
Un Gyu, what's going on? When did you step out?

03:16.370 --> 03:19.199
You better explain exactly what happened.

03:21.740 --> 03:22.770
What are you doing here?

03:23.210 --> 03:24.240
Where are you going, Dad?

03:24.840 --> 03:26.439
You must be on your way to visit the caregiver.

03:28.080 --> 03:31.050
You don't need to go to the hospital. She came home a while ago.

03:31.250 --> 03:32.280
I saw her on my way out.

03:34.419 --> 03:35.819
An eye for an eye,

03:37.159 --> 03:38.620
and a tooth for a tooth.

03:39.360 --> 03:41.689
She kicked out my cat,

03:41.960 --> 03:43.860
so I kicked him out too.

03:46.770 --> 03:48.430
Enough!

03:49.569 --> 03:51.740
Stop it before you embarrass yourself in front of your son!

03:51.800 --> 03:52.870
Park Bok Ja!

03:55.310 --> 03:56.539
That's enough.

03:57.280 --> 03:58.479
Stop this now!

04:01.610 --> 04:02.979
Stop what?

04:04.650 --> 04:08.719
Ms. Park is the one that needs to stop, not me.

04:08.819 --> 04:11.159
- What did you just say? - A little while ago,

04:11.219 --> 04:12.789
you called me a maid, right?

04:13.389 --> 04:16.290
You also belittled me like crazy,

04:16.389 --> 04:17.959
slapped me on the face,

04:18.560 --> 04:19.930
and talked rudely to me.

04:20.470 --> 04:23.870
I put up with all of that though.

04:25.569 --> 04:26.600
But then,

04:27.870 --> 04:31.740
that little thing can't even talk, and it's my family.

04:32.310 --> 04:34.310
You threw my cat out first!

04:34.949 --> 04:38.850
How can you kick out Father's eldest grandchild in the rain?

04:39.620 --> 04:42.889
How can you think that the cat and Un Gyu are the same?

04:42.990 --> 04:45.889
I'm so glad you brought that up.

04:46.990 --> 04:49.730
Un Gyu and Cat are obviously different.

04:49.889 --> 04:52.800
It's not like Un Gyu can't talk or find his way home...

04:52.899 --> 04:54.399
like Cat.

04:54.970 --> 04:58.000
I did what I did because I figured this woman will only understand...

04:58.100 --> 05:01.439
how I feel when she sees her son thrown out in the rain!

05:03.170 --> 05:05.939
Talking isn't enough to get through to Ms. Park.

05:06.009 --> 05:08.310
This wench. How dare you!

05:08.379 --> 05:10.980
Ju Mi. Please, Ju Mi.

05:11.420 --> 05:12.819
Take Un Gyu and go to your room.

05:12.879 --> 05:14.850
- A Jin! - Please.

05:15.319 --> 05:16.490
Please listen to me.

05:18.019 --> 05:19.019
Go to your room, please.

05:29.730 --> 05:30.769
Get out.

05:32.040 --> 05:33.069
I want you out of this house.

05:38.910 --> 05:41.149
I've clearly warned you.

05:43.180 --> 05:44.920
I told you to never cross the line again!

05:51.560 --> 05:52.560
Dad.

05:53.060 --> 05:54.430
Let me inherit my share now.

05:55.160 --> 05:57.430
- What? - I'm going to get divorced.

05:57.529 --> 05:58.529
You little...

05:58.930 --> 06:00.769
Just give my share now.

06:01.199 --> 06:02.600
What's stopping you? The gift tax?

06:02.670 --> 06:04.569
Be quiet.

06:04.639 --> 06:06.600
How much of the company money have you spent?

06:06.670 --> 06:08.310
Then, give me the company.

06:08.410 --> 06:09.509
Goodness.

06:11.579 --> 06:13.949
Get off if you're going to keep spewing such nonsense.

06:14.449 --> 06:16.550
- Mr. Kim, let's go back. - Yes.

06:17.180 --> 06:18.680
Dad, please.

06:18.850 --> 06:20.149
You promised me...

06:21.889 --> 06:24.060
that you'd leave after Father's birthday party.

06:28.329 --> 06:29.459
I...

06:33.060 --> 06:34.300
I won't...

06:35.629 --> 06:38.800
even take one step out of this house.

06:49.980 --> 06:51.279
What is it that you want?

06:54.420 --> 06:57.389
Please tell me what you want.

07:02.730 --> 07:05.199
You can tell me. What do you want?

07:14.040 --> 07:15.639
What I want is...

07:19.139 --> 07:22.310
Gosh, I'm soaked.

07:22.810 --> 07:24.050
Mr. Chairman.

07:25.180 --> 07:28.350
Where were you at this late hour? My gosh, you're soaked.

07:29.120 --> 07:30.920
I went out to go to the hospital to see you.

07:31.759 --> 07:34.660
Are you okay? Why didn't you stay at the hospital longer?

07:34.860 --> 07:35.889
You must be in pain.

07:36.959 --> 07:39.300
Gosh, what are you talking about?

07:40.600 --> 07:42.930
I'm as strong as steel.

07:43.670 --> 07:44.970
Please don't worry.

07:46.000 --> 07:48.939
I couldn't stop worrying about you while I was at the hospital.

07:49.769 --> 07:51.680
It was driving me crazy.

07:53.079 --> 07:55.550
Let's go in, sir. I'll help you get into bed.

07:55.649 --> 07:56.920
My goodness.

07:57.550 --> 07:59.550
Would you like to take a hot bath?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.850
There's some sake left. I'll put it in the water.

08:03.589 --> 08:05.120
We have a serious problem here.

08:07.589 --> 08:08.759
What will you do with that woman?

08:11.529 --> 08:13.800
Get some rest, Jae Hui. It's getting late now.

08:16.069 --> 08:17.740
You aren't the only one who is stressed out.

08:18.100 --> 08:19.100
I'm stressed out too.

08:19.339 --> 08:20.370
My goodness.

08:20.470 --> 08:22.339
Gosh, everyone is ridiculous.

08:35.419 --> 08:36.860
Sir.

08:37.220 --> 08:38.889
It's ready now!

08:39.419 --> 08:40.730
Just a moment, please.

08:54.769 --> 08:55.769
What's that?

08:57.509 --> 08:59.039
Raspberries. This will boost your energy.

09:00.909 --> 09:03.649
By the way, what happened last night? Why was Un Gyu at our place?

09:05.480 --> 09:06.620
That caregiver...

09:07.019 --> 09:08.620
kicked him out in the rain.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.519
Has she gone crazy? Why did she do that? There must have been a reason.

09:11.690 --> 09:13.789
Because Ju Mi threw her cat out.

09:13.990 --> 09:15.929
Gosh. It's Ju Mi's fault then.

09:17.029 --> 09:19.500
Jae Seok, pick your side wisely.

09:19.559 --> 09:21.070
Ju Mi is our family.

09:21.730 --> 09:23.539
You could have only blamed her...

09:23.700 --> 09:26.669
before Ms. Park got back at her with something worse.

09:27.070 --> 09:29.169
So, are you finally going to fire that caregiver?

09:29.710 --> 09:31.139
Father won't let me.

09:31.340 --> 09:34.110
Gosh, my dad. I'm seriously so embarrassed.

09:34.279 --> 09:36.549
He has lost his reason because he's crazy about that woman now.

09:36.750 --> 09:38.049
- Head out for your exercise. - Okay.

09:44.820 --> 09:45.820
You're the best.

10:06.309 --> 10:07.950
Good morning, Father.

10:08.509 --> 10:09.549
You're here.

10:09.950 --> 10:12.980
- Did you have a good sleep? - I slept like a baby.

10:13.490 --> 10:15.620
It must be because of the sake bath I took last night.

10:19.690 --> 10:20.960
Hello, ma'am.

10:21.789 --> 10:23.129
Ms. Park, please spare me a second.

10:26.970 --> 10:28.669
I need to speak with her for a minute.

10:38.909 --> 10:41.379
Ms. Jo, could you give us some privacy?

10:43.879 --> 10:44.950
Shall we have a cup of tea?

10:53.090 --> 10:54.490
Thank you for all of your hard work.

10:54.759 --> 10:57.360
I'm giving you enough compensation for all of your work and injuries.

11:02.370 --> 11:04.240
I thought that this discussion was over.

11:04.669 --> 11:07.909
The circumstances have obviously changed.

11:08.340 --> 11:09.610
Don't you know, ma'am?

11:10.379 --> 11:11.840
What has changed?

11:12.809 --> 11:16.250
How are you going to deal with Mr. Chairman if I leave?

11:16.309 --> 11:18.620
You shouldn't be doing this.

11:21.450 --> 11:22.950
Gosh, my back is killing me.

11:23.090 --> 11:24.960
I heard you had done research on our family.

11:28.330 --> 11:29.529
What is it that you actually want?

11:29.789 --> 11:31.500
You haven't given me your answer yet.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.509
This teacup.

11:40.539 --> 11:42.909
You know whose painting this is, right?

11:43.509 --> 11:46.039
The day we first met,

11:46.279 --> 11:49.509
I asked you if you like Piet Mondrian.

11:50.519 --> 11:52.450
To me, that research isn't anything different...

11:52.549 --> 11:55.889
from asking you if you like the Dutch painter, Piet Mondrian.

11:56.720 --> 11:59.090
I just wanted to know a little about the family I'd be working...

11:59.159 --> 12:01.830
for as well as my employer's background.

12:01.929 --> 12:03.500
That's all.

12:06.259 --> 12:09.000
Ms. Woo, you're not the one who can decide...

12:09.100 --> 12:10.799
whether I should leave.

12:11.740 --> 12:15.639
I'll only listen to Mr. Chairman from now on.

12:15.840 --> 12:18.279
I won't be taking orders from anyone else.

12:19.139 --> 12:21.049
You must leave this house.

12:21.149 --> 12:24.179
Please don't waste your time like this if that's what you want.

12:24.279 --> 12:26.350
Just go talk to Mr. Chairman.

12:26.519 --> 12:28.350
If he wants me to leave,

12:28.419 --> 12:30.860
I'll leave without a single complaint.

12:32.620 --> 12:33.659
Gosh.

12:34.330 --> 12:35.360
Mr. Chairman...

12:35.490 --> 12:38.830
will get all cranky if I leave him outside for this long.

12:41.169 --> 12:44.000
Well, I have to excuse myself.

12:51.080 --> 12:53.909
Gosh, this is driving me nuts.

13:02.649 --> 13:04.590
Isn't it exhausting for you to come by every morning?

13:04.659 --> 13:05.889
Not at all. I like it.

13:06.289 --> 13:08.259
My wife made a raspberry smoothie this morning.

13:09.590 --> 13:10.960
I feel bad.

13:11.299 --> 13:13.600
By the way, your bathtub is too small.

13:14.370 --> 13:16.000
What can I do? I have a small place.

13:16.100 --> 13:17.200
Do you want a bigger place?

13:17.299 --> 13:19.169
Who doesn't want to live in a big place?

13:21.309 --> 13:22.309
Then,

13:22.940 --> 13:24.409
shall I pay you more for the design?

13:26.309 --> 13:27.649
Then, shall I buy you a house...

13:27.980 --> 13:29.210
like sugar daddies do?

13:31.450 --> 13:32.480
Hey, don't do that.

13:38.490 --> 13:41.029
Oh, boy. Just a moment, please.

13:43.399 --> 13:45.860
I don't want you to do things like that anymore.

13:46.230 --> 13:47.700
Just tell Ms. Jo to do it.

13:48.529 --> 13:50.440
Gosh, but that's...

13:50.500 --> 13:51.500
Just do as I say.

14:15.490 --> 14:16.899
I'll tell you a secret.

14:17.159 --> 14:18.700
Ji Hu's dad is having an affair.

14:19.200 --> 14:20.200
What?

14:21.230 --> 14:22.700
How do you know that?

14:22.870 --> 14:25.299
I heard that he got some pills from Dr. Jang.

14:25.639 --> 14:28.509
Stamina-boosting pills that only doctors know about.

14:28.970 --> 14:31.279
Goodness. That doesn't mean he's having an affair.

14:31.440 --> 14:35.149
He said no when he was asked if he's going to take them for his wife.

14:35.450 --> 14:37.980
My gosh, I can't believe that.

14:42.750 --> 14:45.059
Do you know that Ji Hu's dad is having an affair?

14:45.320 --> 14:47.860
Ji Hu's dad? The executive director of Daesung Pulp?

14:49.259 --> 14:51.259
- Yes. - How would I know?

14:52.029 --> 14:54.100
I heard that he got some pills from Dr. Jang.

14:54.370 --> 14:55.399
What kind of pills?

14:55.970 --> 14:57.870
Apparently, only doctors know about it.

14:58.240 --> 14:59.940
It helps men in bed.

15:01.070 --> 15:03.940
There's nothing weird about him taking those pills for his wife.

15:04.309 --> 15:06.710
He said that he's not taking them for his wife.

15:07.309 --> 15:09.009
Every man cheats.

15:10.379 --> 15:14.350
Does that mean the other two guys are cheating on their wives too?

15:15.889 --> 15:18.759
Dr. Jang even tells his wife that he's playing golf...

15:19.159 --> 15:20.690
and goes on trips with his lover from time to time.

15:22.190 --> 15:24.429
It's better to be honest like me.

15:27.129 --> 15:29.769
Ae Ran said that she appreciates everything you've done for her.

15:30.899 --> 15:33.870
Anyway, don't talk about your lover in front of your wife...

15:33.940 --> 15:35.639
who makes food for you every day.

15:40.350 --> 15:42.049
Look, Hyo Ju.

15:43.049 --> 15:44.950
Can you say that you're not hiding anything from me?

15:46.320 --> 15:48.990
Do you need those pills too or what?

15:49.220 --> 15:53.730
Right, your rich husband gives you all the money you need.

15:54.259 --> 15:56.590
I guess you don't need to meet an old man for money.

15:56.730 --> 15:59.460
Young guys don't need such pills, you know.

16:01.129 --> 16:02.200
I don't care what you do.

16:03.129 --> 16:04.899
Just raise my kids well.

16:06.000 --> 16:08.169
I'll put up with everything if you do that well.

16:08.269 --> 16:09.769
What have you even put up with?

16:10.340 --> 16:12.980
You do everything you want to do. There's nothing you put up with.

16:13.509 --> 16:15.350
I'm the one who's been putting up with everything.

16:15.480 --> 16:18.720
I still live with you like a total idiot, fully knowing...

16:19.350 --> 16:21.649
that you've practically been living with your mistress.

16:23.120 --> 16:24.990
You think you're living like an idiot?

16:26.059 --> 16:30.230
I heard that all women cheat on their husbands too these days.

16:38.740 --> 16:40.110
Bring some cold green tea.

16:40.940 --> 16:43.139
You grilled dried corvina. I want to eat it with the tea.

17:00.059 --> 17:01.059
Let's have a quick talk.

17:12.900 --> 17:14.769
You told Ms. Woo, didn't you?

17:16.940 --> 17:17.980
What about?

17:18.410 --> 17:19.779
You must know what I'm talking about.

17:22.410 --> 17:26.279
Did I tell you to watch your tongue or not?

17:28.519 --> 17:31.759
If you get on my nerves one more time,

17:32.720 --> 17:36.390
I'll make sure you get kicked out no matter what.

17:38.559 --> 17:39.930
Remember that.

17:46.069 --> 17:47.210
Are you not going to answer me?

17:47.970 --> 17:49.009
Yes, I will.

17:51.240 --> 17:53.980
Please clean my room too.

18:03.319 --> 18:04.390
You left the door unlocked.

18:05.119 --> 18:07.730
I had the door open earlier to let some fresh air in.

18:07.990 --> 18:09.230
By the way, you're early.

18:09.289 --> 18:11.730
Because of this dress. A Jin is home, right?

18:11.960 --> 18:13.160
She went to Mr. Chairman's place.

18:15.329 --> 18:17.500
That caregiver is causing so much trouble.

18:17.900 --> 18:19.069
She's now saying she won't leave.

18:19.170 --> 18:21.069
Gosh, she promised that she'd leave.

18:21.210 --> 18:22.509
Now, she's saying she won't.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.940
Goodness.

18:26.380 --> 18:29.680
By the way, are all workout clothes odor-proof these days?

18:29.750 --> 18:31.819
Mr. Ahn's workout clothes never stink...

18:32.250 --> 18:34.049
even if he rides his bike in these.

18:34.150 --> 18:36.019
How can they not smell at all?

18:37.359 --> 18:40.430
We also cannot understand why it collapsed.

18:40.589 --> 18:43.960
It cannot collapse like that unless a big tree falls down on it...

18:44.130 --> 18:46.359
or someone intentionally makes it collapse.

18:46.430 --> 18:47.829
It's just impossible.

18:48.630 --> 18:50.069
My employees said...

18:50.170 --> 18:52.400
Ms. Park knocked herself into the pole when she was startled,

18:52.700 --> 18:55.109
but that's not enough to make it collapse like that.

18:55.970 --> 18:59.480
Are you saying that someone might have made it collapse on purpose?

18:59.740 --> 19:03.480
My employees are very experienced, so they rarely make mistakes.

19:03.650 --> 19:06.579
The only thing I can think of is an outsider tampering with it.

19:08.190 --> 19:10.890
There were so many people here that day.

19:10.960 --> 19:12.259
Aren't there security cameras here?

19:31.180 --> 19:33.240
Gyeong Hui doesn't have a membership here, does she?

19:34.150 --> 19:35.180
No, she doesn't.

19:35.410 --> 19:36.920
Her husband only gives her...

19:37.079 --> 19:38.779
8,000 dollars monthly for living expenses.

19:39.420 --> 19:40.519
That includes expenses...

19:40.589 --> 19:42.950
for Yun Jae's education, their cars, insurances and maintenance fees...

19:43.049 --> 19:44.160
for their place.

19:44.720 --> 19:46.960
Gosh, are you serious?

19:47.390 --> 19:49.460
Why can't he just give her 10,000 dollars a month?

19:49.690 --> 19:50.799
I feel bad for her.

19:51.329 --> 19:55.000
I heard he makes over 80,000 dollars a month from the rent.

19:55.170 --> 19:56.529
What a tightwad.

19:56.839 --> 19:59.470
I guess he gives her exactly ten percent of that. Gosh.

20:00.470 --> 20:03.339
By the way, how do you know so much about her family's finances?

20:03.740 --> 20:06.440
Yun Jae's dad goes to the accountant that my husband hired.

20:06.640 --> 20:09.109
You saw the bruise on her arm when we had that yacht party, right?

20:09.880 --> 20:11.220
By the way, is that rumor really true?

20:11.279 --> 20:14.250
Yes, that's what I heard. I think he hits her occasionally.

20:16.119 --> 20:19.420
Why does she put up with that? Yun Jae isn't even her child.

20:20.390 --> 20:21.559
I feel so bad for her.

20:21.789 --> 20:25.259
That's why I can't help but care more about Gyeong Hui.

20:26.559 --> 20:28.200
Shall we go for aromatherapy tomorrow?

20:28.599 --> 20:30.039
I have plans.

20:31.039 --> 20:32.799
Why are you so busy all the time?

20:32.869 --> 20:35.170
That guy you introduced to us on the yacht that day, your partner.

20:35.970 --> 20:37.480
Is he your boyfriend?

20:38.009 --> 20:40.910
What are you talking about? Those guys are just my friends.

20:41.109 --> 20:43.109
You know I'm a member of a few golf clubs.

20:43.250 --> 20:44.380
I don't believe you.

20:44.920 --> 20:48.019
I definitely sensed some chemistry between the two of you.

20:48.150 --> 20:50.119
Stop being so curious.

20:50.220 --> 20:51.759
It's better for you that you don't know.

20:53.960 --> 20:55.430
Why don't you go with A Jin?

20:55.690 --> 20:58.829
She's all over the place these days because of that caregiver.

21:03.329 --> 21:04.640
Does she know about it too?

21:04.900 --> 21:07.170
- What? - Her husband.

21:07.970 --> 21:09.039
What about him?

21:09.170 --> 21:12.079
I heard that he got some pills from your husband.

21:13.509 --> 21:14.549
What kind of pills?

21:16.109 --> 21:17.849
Gyeong Hui told me...

21:18.380 --> 21:21.390
that he got those pills from Dr. Jang.

21:21.890 --> 21:23.519
What pills?

21:23.960 --> 21:26.319
I thought you told Gyeong Hui about it.

21:26.890 --> 21:28.460
Did you have a weird dream last night?

21:28.759 --> 21:29.789
Well...

21:31.559 --> 21:33.059
Gyeong Hui said...

21:33.299 --> 21:37.039
that Ji Hu's dad got those pills from your husband.

21:37.539 --> 21:39.400
She thinks that he's having an affair.

21:44.140 --> 21:46.640
Gosh, that woman is a piece of work.

21:46.710 --> 21:48.609
I don't even know what to do.

21:49.180 --> 21:51.750
It looks like she had everything planned out from the get-go.

21:51.920 --> 21:53.019
I think so too.

21:53.750 --> 21:57.160
Even on Mr. Chairman's birthday, she made a grand entrance...

21:57.259 --> 21:59.559
and surprised him with a plate full of pork rinds.

22:00.890 --> 22:02.930
Why did that canopy collapse right at that moment?

22:03.059 --> 22:06.460
My father-in-law is so moved, thinking that she saved his life.

22:06.559 --> 22:09.599
That canopy happened to collapse at the perfect moment for her.

22:09.769 --> 22:12.299
- Don't you think that it's strange? - It's totally strange.

22:12.500 --> 22:15.809
There are security cameras by the garden gate and the main entrance,

22:15.910 --> 22:17.680
but that area happens to be a blind spot.

22:17.779 --> 22:20.849
And why did the cat crawl under the table right at that moment?

22:23.720 --> 22:25.750
My skin looks so dull because I kept waking up last night.

22:28.849 --> 22:31.089
Tomorrow is another day, right?

22:31.960 --> 22:34.059
No more stress for me today.

22:36.559 --> 22:37.700
A Jin, here.

22:38.630 --> 22:39.960
The dress and the handbag.

22:40.569 --> 22:42.670
This turned out even better than I thought.

22:49.109 --> 22:51.839
Did you really design this yourself?

22:51.980 --> 22:54.950
I eyeballed your measurements. You should try it on.

22:55.309 --> 22:57.920
That bag was designed to go with the dress.

22:58.079 --> 22:59.519
It's so beautiful.

22:59.720 --> 23:01.750
You know that Ji Hu won a prize in the drawing competition.

23:01.920 --> 23:03.049
Thank you so much.

23:03.420 --> 23:05.089
I'd like to pay you, but you keep rejecting it.

23:05.220 --> 23:08.630
Gosh, you didn't have to do this. You've already helped out so much.

23:11.559 --> 23:12.599
Just a second, please.

23:45.559 --> 23:47.900
- Oh, my. It looks amazing on you. - I know, right?

23:48.069 --> 23:49.299
I love it.

23:49.430 --> 23:50.470
I'm glad to hear that.

23:50.799 --> 23:54.609
You sure can pull off anything. You made my design look so high-end.

23:57.039 --> 23:59.880
Don't be intimidated by Ms. Seo when you meet her.

24:00.009 --> 24:01.880
I got your back,

24:01.980 --> 24:04.079
so you can feel free to speak up.

24:04.650 --> 24:05.980
Thank you so much.

24:08.289 --> 24:10.059
"Her arms, legs,"

24:10.920 --> 24:13.759
"thighs, and waist..."

24:14.630 --> 24:16.730
"looked as smooth as oil..."

24:16.930 --> 24:19.059
"and as undulant as a swan..."

24:19.829 --> 24:23.170
"Her belly and breasts."

24:24.740 --> 24:27.009
"The grapes of my vine..."

24:27.769 --> 24:29.470
"troubled the quiet that had possessed my soul."

24:32.940 --> 24:34.779
"Her waist..."

24:35.680 --> 24:38.519
"accentuated the fullness of her hips."

24:39.220 --> 24:42.990
"That tawny brown skin and the rouge..."

24:43.519 --> 24:46.789
"looked divine together."

25:07.180 --> 25:08.809
- Ms. Baek is here, right? - Yes.

25:11.480 --> 25:12.480
A Jin.

25:12.750 --> 25:13.789
Ms. Baek.

25:14.220 --> 25:17.390
We should have a cup of tea. I have two hours to the next class.

25:17.559 --> 25:18.589
Sure.

25:20.259 --> 25:22.130
That many students have quit?

25:22.359 --> 25:24.559
Yes, moms in this area are like that.

25:25.099 --> 25:28.799
They have such an elitist attitude. They cannot tolerate anyone...

25:28.900 --> 25:31.339
from the underprivileged entering their social circle.

25:31.599 --> 25:34.809
They don't even want their kids to be in the same class as average,

25:34.970 --> 25:37.880
yet I accepted so-called problem kids with bad grades,

25:37.980 --> 25:39.140
so they're upset.

25:39.609 --> 25:40.609
What are you going to do?

25:41.450 --> 25:42.609
That being said,

25:43.480 --> 25:45.579
can we put up a banner about Ji Hu getting a 100 percent...

25:45.680 --> 25:46.750
on the math competition?

25:47.849 --> 25:48.890
Would you mind?

25:52.319 --> 25:54.759
Using a specific student's name to publicize my institute...

25:54.859 --> 25:56.259
goes against my principles,

25:56.759 --> 25:57.960
so I wasn't going to do it anyway.

25:58.660 --> 26:00.599
You don't need to feel bad.

26:00.730 --> 26:02.069
Please don't worry about it.

26:02.230 --> 26:04.240
No, Ms. Baek. Please feel free to do it.

26:04.339 --> 26:07.140
Ji Hu's grades have gone up thanks to your guidance.

26:07.339 --> 26:08.410
Please go ahead.

26:09.109 --> 26:12.980
I was hesitant because I thought it may tarnish the institute's image.

26:13.210 --> 26:15.910
I have to compromise at times. I need to earn a living.

26:16.609 --> 26:19.220
All right. Please go ahead and put up a banner with Ji Hu's name.

26:19.880 --> 26:21.549
Thanks, A Jin.

26:27.230 --> 26:29.960
The lawyer, Mr. Kang Gi Ho wants you to give him a call.

26:30.059 --> 26:32.259
I told him I'm with you. He says he has something to tell you.

26:37.569 --> 26:38.569
Hello?

26:39.200 --> 26:40.710
It's me, your partner.

26:40.839 --> 26:42.140
Hello, partner.

26:42.440 --> 26:44.609
I heard you wanted me to give you a call. What's up?

26:44.980 --> 26:48.710
Well, remember the gimbap I ate that day?

26:48.980 --> 26:50.150
I couldn't digest it at all.

26:55.319 --> 26:56.349
Thank you.

27:04.559 --> 27:05.559
Eat up.

27:05.859 --> 27:08.730
- Gosh, I don't like porridge. - You're so picky.

27:09.230 --> 27:10.839
Are we eating porridge because of me?

27:11.140 --> 27:13.140
- Yes. - Gosh, I feel bad.

27:14.970 --> 27:16.710
Eat up. You should take some medicine after.

27:16.839 --> 27:18.509
You won't get better if you don't take medicine.

27:21.410 --> 27:22.450
About that woman...

27:22.950 --> 27:23.980
Yes.

27:23.980 --> 27:25.980
- One you asked me to investigate. - Yes.

27:26.420 --> 27:29.049
I found out that she served a year and eight months in jail...

27:29.250 --> 27:31.259
for fraud and embezzlement back in 2007.

27:31.920 --> 27:35.059
She manipulated accounting numbers and embezzled 300,000 dollars.

27:35.730 --> 27:38.099
The police suspected that she had an accomplice,

27:38.730 --> 27:40.730
but she said that she did everything alone.

27:41.329 --> 27:44.339
Has she ever been married? I heard that she had a child.

27:44.670 --> 27:47.269
I don't know whether she had a child from a relationship,

27:48.009 --> 27:49.710
but she has never been married.

27:52.809 --> 27:53.950
She grew up as an orphan.

27:54.910 --> 27:57.980
She was adopted at the age of 10, but was abandoned for some reason.

27:58.079 --> 28:00.119
She was also expelled from school in grade 10.

28:00.619 --> 28:02.519
She got her high school diploma through the GED test.

28:03.250 --> 28:05.490
She worked for a while as a bookkeeper at a company...

28:05.559 --> 28:06.859
that supported the orphanage,

28:07.359 --> 28:10.099
but there are no records on her whatsoever...

28:10.730 --> 28:11.900
from 2009 to 2015.

28:15.529 --> 28:17.339
You should eat. The porridge will get cold.

28:19.000 --> 28:20.000
Okay.

28:44.660 --> 28:45.700
Ms. Jo.

28:46.400 --> 28:49.369
I'm going out. Please feed Cat for me.

28:49.730 --> 28:50.740
Sure.

28:52.000 --> 28:53.869
Dad!

28:54.569 --> 28:56.109
He went to the office.

28:58.309 --> 28:59.440
Where are you going?

28:59.940 --> 29:01.210
You're dressed to the nines.

29:01.549 --> 29:03.619
I'm heading out to shop for walking aids for him.

29:03.849 --> 29:05.119
I see, walking aids.

29:05.420 --> 29:09.019
He won't recover quickly if he sits in the wheelchair all the time.

29:10.589 --> 29:12.160
You're so enthusiastic about your job.

29:13.059 --> 29:14.059
Don't go overboard.

29:14.130 --> 29:17.400
I give my best in everything I do.

29:17.460 --> 29:19.259
All right. Good for you.

29:19.930 --> 29:23.269
Please pick up a pair of pants for me to wear at home on your way back.

29:24.940 --> 29:27.470
I get that it's just for home, but I don't know what you like.

29:27.539 --> 29:30.039
I wouldn't know what to buy.

29:30.140 --> 29:31.740
Just get whatever.

29:31.880 --> 29:33.910
I think I'll stay here for quite a while.

29:34.680 --> 29:36.750
Didn't you say that you'll leave sometime next week?

29:36.849 --> 29:39.680
You're going all out. How can I leave knowing that?

29:41.119 --> 29:42.650
Just buy whatever comfy pants.

29:42.849 --> 29:44.289
I'll be wearing them at home anyway.

29:45.119 --> 29:46.420
Size S.

29:46.930 --> 29:47.960
All right.

30:00.509 --> 30:02.039
That crazy wench.

30:08.579 --> 30:11.420
A high-end designer bag, clothes,

30:11.680 --> 30:13.079
and shoes.

30:14.289 --> 30:15.619
My dad must have lost his mind.

30:23.400 --> 30:24.559
Did they sleep together?

30:25.059 --> 30:26.059
They didn't, right?

30:26.430 --> 30:27.500

This is the artist who's designing packaging of one of our products.

I'll head to the meeting room first, Mr. Ahn.

31:01.970 --> 31:04.170
Sure, go ahead.

31:09.140 --> 31:11.809
You shouldn't visit me at work unannounced like this.

31:11.910 --> 31:13.410
I was working,

31:13.509 --> 31:16.380
but I started missing you so much all of a sudden.

31:16.609 --> 31:19.680
I have a meeting. We're accepting bids for a new project.

31:19.880 --> 31:22.220
What? I guess you're not happy to see me.

31:22.390 --> 31:24.559
Hey, I'm working now.

31:24.859 --> 31:27.259
I have to sell a lot of this to keep supporting you financially.

31:27.329 --> 31:29.630
That's how I can keep you happy.

31:33.630 --> 31:35.269
Regarding the safety testing, the FDA says...

31:39.500 --> 31:42.869
We can skip it as long as it doesn't contain styrene.

31:54.190 --> 31:55.349
Who would imagine...

31:55.420 --> 31:57.420
that out of everyone, you get knockoffs...

31:57.519 --> 31:59.759
of super expensive designer clothes made for 500 dollars?

31:59.819 --> 32:02.589
Don't say that. I don't copy those designs.

32:02.730 --> 32:03.960
I only use them as a reference.

32:04.630 --> 32:06.970
I know that. I didn't say anything.

32:09.130 --> 32:10.640
By the way, is something bothering you?

32:10.839 --> 32:12.369
You look stressed out.

32:13.299 --> 32:16.309
I am worried and stressed out.

32:16.710 --> 32:18.039
What's going on?

32:18.809 --> 32:19.910
It's regarding family matters.

32:20.549 --> 32:23.349
I guess even those with rich husbands have worries.

32:23.750 --> 32:25.420
Isn't it better to marry a guy who's dependent...

32:25.519 --> 32:28.220
on his salary and worries about paying next month's rent like me?

32:29.950 --> 32:32.289
Se Hui, being part of this society is tough.

32:32.559 --> 32:34.559
- This society? - The upper class.

32:34.960 --> 32:37.500
Their league, their world.

32:37.759 --> 32:40.269
Those who want to enter it, those who want to protect it,

32:40.670 --> 32:42.430
and those who can't tolerate coexistence.

32:43.329 --> 32:44.440
It's like a battlefield.

32:44.500 --> 32:46.970
That world looks so peaceful to me.

32:47.039 --> 32:48.769
Never. You're the winner.

32:51.380 --> 32:53.809
- I'll just wear the shop shoes. - All right.

Is he in surgery now?

33:05.819 --> 33:06.829
Yes.

33:07.329 --> 33:08.359
What kind of surgery?

33:08.490 --> 33:10.130
Revision rhinoplasty.

33:10.230 --> 33:11.299
When did he go in?

33:11.599 --> 33:14.170
He's putting her to sleep now, so he won't be out for a while.

33:14.269 --> 33:16.769
You said it's rhinoplasty. It should be over in an hour.

33:16.839 --> 33:20.339
Well, the patient doesn't have any cartilage in her ears,

33:20.440 --> 33:22.309
so I think it'll take a while.

33:24.309 --> 33:27.009
Why are you stammering so much?

33:27.509 --> 33:28.509
Sorry?

33:28.609 --> 33:30.349
Do you talk like that to patients too?

33:30.549 --> 33:31.950
No, of course not.

33:32.180 --> 33:34.619
It makes you look untrustworthy.

33:36.190 --> 33:39.289
Call me as soon as he's out. I'll go grocery shopping while waiting.

She doesn't give face or foot readings.

40:07.250 --> 40:09.210
Due to her unique method based on phrenology,

40:09.280 --> 40:13.019
you had to book a year in advance to get your skull examined by her.

I went down to see what was going on. The patient woke up too early,

41:22.550 --> 41:24.920
so he had to put her to sleep again. That's why it's taking longer.

42:19.710 --> 42:21.650

42:22.449 --> 42:23.920
By the way, what brings you here?

42:24.079 --> 42:26.280
I couldn't stay home because I was too frustrated.

42:27.289 --> 42:30.389
I'll ask you quickly and leave. You better answer right away.

42:32.119 --> 42:34.630

42:35.159 --> 42:36.159
Yes.

42:36.159 --> 42:37.199
What kind of pills?

42:38.199 --> 42:39.960
They're for male hormone imbalance.

42:40.030 --> 42:41.969
They're like potent stamina-boosting pills.

42:42.329 --> 42:44.239

She came here a little while ago to get Botox injections.

43:01.320 --> 43:03.760

43:03.889 --> 43:06.119
I told her without even realizing it.

43:06.519 --> 43:07.889
I've been regretting it.

43:11.000 --> 43:13.769
I see. I was wondering what happened.

43:14.829 --> 43:17.000
Anyway, you shouldn't have given him those pills.

43:18.300 --> 43:21.340
I gave them to him thinking that they'd improve his marriage.

43:21.539 --> 43:22.969

44:28.739 --> 44:30.239
I don't like this.

44:30.909 --> 44:31.909
I really don't.

44:32.679 --> 44:34.110
I'm not dating her.

44:34.409 --> 44:36.050
A kiss doesn't mean we're dating.

44:39.250 --> 44:40.420
What's this nonsense now?

44:41.050 --> 44:42.090
Are you drunk?

44:42.389 --> 44:45.159
Dad, I'll take care of the company,

44:45.260 --> 44:47.230
so you don't need to come here anymore.

44:47.389 --> 44:50.260
You've been coming here so often because your health has improved.

44:50.360 --> 44:52.099
Look at what you're doing.

44:52.159 --> 44:55.570
Dad, these things have to be eye-catching.

44:55.730 --> 44:56.969
This is our strategy.

44:57.070 --> 44:59.500
Jeez, I should just not know what's going on.

45:00.309 --> 45:02.309
Mr. Oh, call Mr. Kim.

45:02.610 --> 45:03.880
I want to go home.

45:04.110 --> 45:05.110
Yes, sir.

45:10.880 --> 45:14.719
I bought the one with the most eye-catching colors.

45:14.920 --> 45:17.989
I bought matching socks too.

45:18.119 --> 45:20.889
- Are you trying to get back at me? - What are you talking about?

45:21.090 --> 45:23.059
Are you trying to tell me to never send you on errands?

45:23.130 --> 45:26.099
Gosh, please don't get the wrong idea.

45:26.429 --> 45:28.829
They're known as "Refrigerator Pants."

45:29.030 --> 45:32.099
Once you try them on, you won't be able to wear other pants.

45:32.300 --> 45:35.369
- They're so comfortable. - You wear them then.

45:35.639 --> 45:36.679
I don't want to.

45:37.440 --> 45:39.280
I've worn them too many times in my life.

45:39.980 --> 45:41.010
I won't wear them anymore.

45:46.690 --> 45:48.090
Did something happen?

45:48.349 --> 45:51.519
Mom, I'm tired. I'll nap for just 20 minutes.

45:51.590 --> 45:53.760
I didn't get any sleep last night.

45:53.929 --> 45:56.260
No, don't sleep here.

45:56.360 --> 45:58.329
Sleep in my room, okay?

46:00.570 --> 46:01.900
Gosh.

46:02.599 --> 46:05.940
Aunt Jin Hui, I just got a text from Mom. She says that I should be...

46:06.000 --> 46:08.809
dropped off at Grandma's place after the lesson. We'll have dinner there.

46:08.940 --> 46:10.510
All right, I got the text too.

46:10.980 --> 46:12.639
I should show Grandma too.

46:13.139 --> 46:15.809
- Show her what? - Grandpa's birthday party videos.

46:16.449 --> 46:17.550
She'll enjoy them.

46:18.079 --> 46:19.579
Did you record a video of your mom singing?

46:19.679 --> 46:22.420
Yes. Did you record a video of me playing the violin?

46:22.519 --> 46:24.360
Yes. Of course, I recorded everything.

46:24.420 --> 46:27.489
I also recorded a video of you eating things and running around.

46:27.559 --> 46:30.460
Hey, you better delete that video.

46:30.559 --> 46:32.760
- I'll think about it. - You little...

46:32.829 --> 46:34.500
I won't be able to get married.

46:36.469 --> 46:38.139
- See you later, Aunt Jin Hui. - All right.

46:48.210 --> 46:49.480
(Ji Hu)

46:52.480 --> 46:55.190
You've been recording a video of me eating, right? Stop it already.

46:55.349 --> 46:57.889
- This rascal, Ji Hu. - Seriously, stop recording!

46:57.989 --> 47:00.360
Aunt Jin Hui is telling you to stop recording the video.

47:01.530 --> 47:03.559
Ji Hu, then record something pretty.

47:03.929 --> 47:05.130
I'll look pretty. Record this.

47:06.329 --> 47:09.929
Then, the chairman suddenly got up from his wheelchair.

47:10.400 --> 47:12.239
She's one wicked woman.

47:12.570 --> 47:14.239
What should I do now?

47:14.610 --> 47:16.039
There isn't much you can do.

47:16.469 --> 47:18.940
Just suck up to her. People like us don't have any power.

47:19.610 --> 47:22.150
Does the chairman still like her knowing that she's an ex-con?

47:22.210 --> 47:23.949
He's head over heels for her.

47:24.449 --> 47:26.989
I wonder what she does for him behind the closed doors.

47:27.489 --> 47:29.750
It's almost as if he is completely bewitched by her.

47:30.320 --> 47:32.989
It's so unlike him.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.530
He normally hates letting people who are not his family inside the house.

47:37.030 --> 47:40.570
Even for housekeeping, he doesn't want to hire anyone else, but me.

47:40.800 --> 47:43.000
Gosh, I want to know what her secret is.

47:44.300 --> 47:47.070
I'm telling you. Behind every exceptionally delicious food,

47:47.269 --> 47:49.239
there's a secret that nobody knows.

47:49.340 --> 47:50.909
- That's right. - Something that only I know.

47:51.210 --> 47:53.380
I bet that woman has such a secret.

48:03.960 --> 48:04.989
Sir.

48:05.460 --> 48:07.960
We'll make progress starting today.

48:09.460 --> 48:13.869
I'll do everything I can do to make sure you regain your health.

48:14.130 --> 48:16.800
- Thanks. - It's my pleasure.

48:16.869 --> 48:19.400
- Please hold me and try to get up. - All right.

48:19.769 --> 48:22.269
Here. You can do it.

48:23.070 --> 48:25.809
Good. Hold this here.

48:27.010 --> 48:31.280
I'll take my hands off now, so please try it on your own.

48:31.349 --> 48:34.489
- Okay. - All right. There.

48:35.789 --> 48:36.989
I've taken my hands off.

48:39.389 --> 48:40.659
Yes, you're doing great.

48:42.630 --> 48:45.900
You can walk so well now, sir.

48:46.869 --> 48:51.070
Gosh, sir. Are you okay?

48:51.539 --> 48:53.869
Sir. My goodness. Sir, are you all right?

48:55.409 --> 48:58.210
Ms. Park, shall we live together?

49:03.150 --> 49:04.579
We already live together.

49:04.750 --> 49:06.119
Not like this.

49:06.750 --> 49:07.989
As husband and wife.

49:08.349 --> 49:09.349
That's what I meant.

49:11.019 --> 49:12.159
Sir.

49:12.889 --> 49:15.630
I just want to make you healthy again.

49:15.690 --> 49:17.199
I don't want anything else.

49:17.500 --> 49:22.000
I shouldn't even dare to dream of having a husband like you.

49:22.869 --> 49:25.699
I'll get better soon. I will regain my health.

49:40.449 --> 49:44.090
Call Jae Seok. Tell him to have dinner with us here.

49:44.559 --> 49:45.789
- Shall I? - Yes.

49:47.329 --> 49:48.329
I can't.

49:48.590 --> 49:51.230
I have a very important meeting today.

49:52.199 --> 49:54.400
Whom am I meeting? It's Mr. Yun.

49:54.929 --> 49:56.099
He's our client.

49:56.739 --> 49:58.369
I promised him that I'd come by today.

49:59.539 --> 50:00.610
I think he's busy.

50:00.710 --> 50:03.269
He works so hard these days. He's almost like a different person.

50:03.340 --> 50:04.840
I'm glad to hear that.

50:05.280 --> 50:07.809
He has also been exercising early in the morning every day.

50:07.909 --> 50:08.909
I can't believe it.

50:08.949 --> 50:10.119
- Early in the morning? - Yes.

50:10.380 --> 50:12.280
My gosh, what has gotten into him?

50:12.449 --> 50:13.750
- Taste this for me. - Sure.

50:18.820 --> 50:20.190
It's so good.

50:20.489 --> 50:22.659
It's chewy, nutty, and soft.

50:23.090 --> 50:25.329
It's delicious.

50:25.400 --> 50:26.769
It sounds like Jae Seok has matured.

50:34.969 --> 50:38.280
Wear these. I bought some underwear and loungewear for you.

50:40.449 --> 50:41.480
Thanks.

50:56.760 --> 50:58.360
Dear, eat this.

51:00.599 --> 51:04.369
What is this? It's spicy sea snails with noodles.

51:09.840 --> 51:10.840
Sleep here tonight.

51:11.780 --> 51:12.780
I can't.

51:14.480 --> 51:15.510
Why can't you?

51:15.809 --> 51:17.179
I have to sleep at home.

51:17.750 --> 51:19.449
Why do you have to sleep at home?

51:19.519 --> 51:20.690
My wife will kill me if I don't.

51:21.150 --> 51:23.489
- Why will she kill you? - That's just A Jin's rule.

51:23.789 --> 51:25.219
I must sleep at home without exception.

51:26.989 --> 51:28.989
That woman's rules don't matter anymore.

51:30.760 --> 51:33.929
It's not like you're seeing me because she told you to do so.

51:34.900 --> 51:35.929
That's true.

51:36.230 --> 51:40.210
What I'm trying to tell you is that you're already not listening to her.

51:40.269 --> 51:43.070
No, you do not listen to that woman anymore.

51:43.480 --> 51:45.980
I do understand where you're coming from,

51:46.309 --> 51:48.349
but stop calling her "that woman."

51:48.480 --> 51:50.980
She always calls you Artist Yun Seong Hui,

51:51.079 --> 51:53.179
or Ms. Yun. She calls you so respectfully,

51:53.389 --> 51:55.119
but you keep calling her "that woman."

51:55.550 --> 51:57.389
That makes her look like an idiot.

51:57.619 --> 52:00.190
Are you taking her side now because she's your wife?

52:00.789 --> 52:03.960
I'm not taking her side. I'm just telling you how I feel.

52:04.099 --> 52:05.699
My goal is for all of us to be happy.

52:07.599 --> 52:09.599
- Why are you taking it? - You don't deserve to eat this.

52:12.239 --> 52:14.739
Hey, don't you dare do things like that ever again.

52:16.809 --> 52:19.980
I hate it when women act up like that.

52:20.250 --> 52:24.019
How dare you take my food and throw it out?

52:25.150 --> 52:26.179
You little...

52:26.349 --> 52:27.789
I guess I've been way too nice to you.

52:27.849 --> 52:29.289
You better behave yourself.

52:29.949 --> 52:30.960
Gosh.

52:31.659 --> 52:32.860
I don't want this.

52:37.230 --> 52:39.059
Gosh, seriously. Get lost!

52:47.639 --> 52:49.070
The things that she does...

52:49.710 --> 52:51.210
Gosh, women are really...

52:52.280 --> 52:54.909
They act so entitled when men are nice to them.

53:03.860 --> 53:05.960
(Seong Ju)

53:08.659 --> 53:09.690
Hey.

53:10.300 --> 53:12.030
Hey, Seong Su.

53:12.500 --> 53:14.000
Nothing happened, right?

53:14.929 --> 53:16.800
Yes, she believed me,

53:17.369 --> 53:19.070
but why did you say that to my wife?

53:19.869 --> 53:20.909
What did I say?

53:21.340 --> 53:23.340
You told her about Ji Hu's dad getting the pills from me.

53:23.710 --> 53:25.380
I never told Gi Ok about it.

53:27.079 --> 53:28.079
Oh, no.

53:28.780 --> 53:30.719
I didn't think about that.

53:31.719 --> 53:33.119
My gosh.

53:33.389 --> 53:34.789
I'm really sorry.

53:35.949 --> 53:36.989
Okay.

53:45.800 --> 53:48.429
A Jin? We're on our way now.

53:48.869 --> 53:50.840
There's something I have to show you.

53:57.309 --> 53:59.679
My sweetheart, I'm happy to see you enjoying the food.

54:01.679 --> 54:02.679
- Eat the spinach too. - Ji Hu.

54:02.750 --> 54:05.920
You've been recording a video of me eating, right? Stop it already.

54:06.949 --> 54:08.550
Seriously, stop recording!

54:08.619 --> 54:10.960
Aunt Jin Hui is telling you to stop recording the video.

54:12.159 --> 54:13.690
Ji Hu, then record something pretty.

54:16.929 --> 54:19.130
The poem I read for you earlier today...

54:19.429 --> 54:22.030
was written by the French poet who was known as a genius,

54:22.130 --> 54:23.639
Charles Baudelaire.

54:23.800 --> 54:26.239
Baudelaire was obsessed with Jeanne Duval,

54:26.340 --> 54:29.070
a woman of mixed French and African ancestry.

54:29.309 --> 54:33.380
She wasn't that pretty,

54:33.610 --> 54:37.679
but she greatly inspired Baudelaire.

54:38.050 --> 54:40.050
You're so knowledgeable.

54:41.190 --> 54:43.989
Ms. Park, how much education did you get?

54:44.889 --> 54:48.559
Gosh. I did get into college, but I couldn't afford the tuition fees,

54:48.929 --> 54:50.030
so I dropped out.

54:50.230 --> 54:51.230
What about your parents?

54:53.769 --> 54:56.699
My dad was the headman of our village,

54:56.800 --> 54:59.000
but he passed away from cancer.

55:00.510 --> 55:03.510
My mom had a stroke two years ago...

55:03.610 --> 55:05.679
and passed away as well.

55:06.949 --> 55:08.409
Do you have no siblings?

55:08.780 --> 55:09.880
No, I have none.

55:10.820 --> 55:11.880
I see.

55:13.150 --> 55:15.519
You would have been successful if you had received a good education.

55:17.590 --> 55:20.590
Even as a little kid, whenever I saw things written...

55:20.690 --> 55:22.590
on white pieces of paper,

55:22.690 --> 55:25.199
I made sure to read every letter and word.

55:26.630 --> 55:27.800
Maybe that's why.

55:28.300 --> 55:30.300
I think you're different...

55:30.699 --> 55:31.769
from other women.

55:40.710 --> 55:44.050
- Hey, Gi Ok. - Shall we have brunch after yoga?

55:44.280 --> 55:45.380
I have something to tell you.

55:46.179 --> 55:47.219
Sure.

55:52.090 --> 55:53.789
(Blocked Caller ID)

55:58.900 --> 56:02.500
(Blocked Caller ID)

56:05.139 --> 56:08.440
- Hello? - Hi, did you not get my text?

56:08.710 --> 56:11.309
Your husband is seeing another woman...

56:11.380 --> 56:13.980
Hey, who are you? What is this nonsense about...

56:41.639 --> 56:44.380
Princess, we're home. You go in first.

56:44.840 --> 56:45.880
What about you, Mom?

56:46.039 --> 56:48.309
I'll stop by Grandpa's place for a few minutes.

57:00.429 --> 57:03.130
Sir, I'll fill up the bathtub so that you can take a bath.

58:25.679 --> 58:26.679
A Jin!

58:29.579 --> 58:31.519
You said that you'd be home late today.

58:31.849 --> 58:33.389
What? It was...

58:34.150 --> 58:36.590
Mr. Yun proposed something completely ridiculous,

58:36.960 --> 58:38.119
so I just cursed at him and left.

58:39.760 --> 58:41.289
By the way, why are you here?

58:42.059 --> 58:43.659
Let's go in. You'll find out.

58:47.230 --> 58:48.469
Everyone should watch this.

58:48.969 --> 58:50.000
What is it?

58:50.599 --> 58:52.000
(Jin Hui)

59:01.849 --> 59:04.019
Father, there's something I have to tell you.

59:04.079 --> 59:05.849
I have something to tell you guys too.

59:06.579 --> 59:08.090
All of you are here,

59:09.289 --> 59:10.289
so this is perfect.

59:11.090 --> 59:12.760
Do you mind waiting upstairs with Ms. Jo?

59:12.860 --> 59:13.929
That's not necessary.

59:15.630 --> 59:16.659
I...

59:18.929 --> 59:20.500
have decided to marry her.

59:23.170 --> 59:24.199
Dad.

59:49.090 --> 59:51.630
(The Lady in Dignity)

59:51.730 --> 59:53.969
They say that you never know what tomorrow may bring.

59:54.070 --> 59:55.800
What if she marries the chairman of Daesung Pulp?

59:55.900 --> 59:57.840
Are you saying she'll be my mother-in-law?

59:57.940 --> 59:59.300
If you don't want to be misunderstood,

59:59.300 --> 01:00:01.469
tell him that you won't marry him.

01:00:01.570 --> 01:00:03.840
I want to have your baby.

01:00:04.510 --> 01:00:07.880
She got pregnant accidentally. It was clearly a case of rape.

01:00:08.449 --> 01:00:11.280
Every woman thinks that her husband would never cheat on her.

01:00:11.349 --> 01:00:13.320
How's your husband these days?

01:00:13.389 --> 01:00:14.420
What about your husband?

01:00:14.519 --> 01:00:16.250
Just give up. Those two will get married.

01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:18.489
- What? - Not me. I'm talking about Dad.

01:00:18.559 --> 01:00:20.489
He didn't ride his bike in the morning.

01:00:20.690 --> 01:00:22.030
Keep a watchful eye on him.

01:00:22.090 --> 01:00:23.599
Ms. Woo is here now!

01:00:23.760 --> 01:00:25.360
Hide. Go under the sofa.

01:00:25.429 --> 01:00:26.530
Dad, are you cheating on Mom?

01:00:26.599 --> 01:00:29.969
I will not forgive anyone who breaks Mom's heart.

01:00:31.440 --> 01:00:32.539
Is it you, Jeong A?

01:00:33.070 --> 01:00:34.110
Cho Hui!

01:00:34.170 --> 01:00:37.010
I tried to find you.

01:00:37.610 --> 01:00:39.809
I saw someone lurking around our house.

01:00:39.880 --> 01:00:42.510
It was the guy in the video you sent me.

01:00:42.610 --> 01:00:44.219
Get rid of that phone right away.

01:00:44.320 --> 01:00:46.179
Try to rack your brain, you punk.

01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:49.320
If there are records that we spoke on the phone, we'll be screwed.

01:00:50.190 --> 01:00:52.260
I found out who that man in the video is.
