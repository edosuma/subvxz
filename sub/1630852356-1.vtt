- Mmm.
- Goodness gracious me!

07:58.580 --> 07:59.749
Where'd your statement piece go?

07:59.750 --> 08:01.249
Uh, no matter.

08:01.250 --> 08:02.459
As long as you've
still got your kapowie.

08:02.460 --> 08:04.119
Is the extra ready?

08:04.120 --> 08:05.619
- [weakly] Ready.
- Good, good, good!

08:05.620 --> 08:07.579
Now, remember, small boy,
your line is,

08:07.580 --> 08:09.289
"We now carry
scrumptious jelly doughnuts

08:09.290 --> 08:10.619
made fresh every day."

08:10.620 --> 08:13.379
And... action!

08:13.380 --> 08:14.619
[gulp] We--

08:14.620 --> 08:17.789
We now carry scrumpunch--
Scrimnas?

08:17.790 --> 08:20.419
No, flumptious. Aah!
Let me try that again.

08:20.420 --> 08:23.379
The line is, "We now carry
scrumptious jelly doughnuts

08:23.380 --> 08:24.959
made fresh every day."

08:24.960 --> 08:26.379
Yes, yes! I got it now!

08:26.380 --> 08:28.289
We now carry
scrumptious smelly--

08:28.290 --> 08:30.169
Not smelly! Not smelly!

08:30.170 --> 08:31.829
Aah! Skip this line!
We'll come back to it!

08:31.830 --> 08:34.120
- [groaning]
- Made fresh every spray.

08:35.540 --> 08:38.209
Aah! Jelly doughnuts?!

08:38.210 --> 08:40.169
Jelly doughnuts!

08:40.170 --> 08:42.459
Cut! Sorry, kid!

08:42.460 --> 08:43.789
You used to have "it."

08:43.790 --> 08:45.209
But now you don't got "it,"

08:45.210 --> 08:46.419
and I need "it."

08:46.420 --> 08:47.420
[screaming] Get it?!

08:49.120 --> 08:51.829
Just to be clear,
"it" is kapowie, right?

08:51.830 --> 08:53.580
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes.
Now shoo!

08:54.830 --> 08:56.419
Another child star burns out.

08:56.420 --> 08:58.249
What a shame.
What a shame!

08:58.250 --> 09:00.329
Oh! And now I've worked
myself up into a tizzy!

09:00.330 --> 09:01.619
Towel girl!

09:01.620 --> 09:03.419
Why, thank you.
Hey, I like your look.

09:03.420 --> 09:05.579
- What's your name?
- I'm Gloria.

09:05.580 --> 09:08.499
I auditioned this morning
and you rejected me?

09:08.500 --> 09:10.419
Well, things have changed,
and we need a star.

09:10.420 --> 09:11.420
You're back, baby!

09:11.421 --> 09:12.460
[gasping]

09:14.500 --> 09:15.380
[sigh]

09:15.381 --> 09:16.919
Well, I blew it, Tilly.

09:16.920 --> 09:19.459
I used to be
such a confident, cool guy,

09:19.460 --> 09:20.999
and now that I've lost my hair,

09:21.000 --> 09:22.209
I'm nothing.

09:22.210 --> 09:25.209
No, Cricket, that's not true.

09:25.210 --> 09:27.419
If there's one thing
I've learned today,

09:27.420 --> 09:29.919
it's that it doesn't matter
if a doughnut is glazed

09:29.920 --> 09:33.709
or powdered
or "covered in sprinkles,"

09:33.710 --> 09:37.039
they've always got jelly
on the inside!

09:37.040 --> 09:38.419
What are you talkin'
about doughnuts for?

09:38.420 --> 09:39.709
Talk about me!

09:39.710 --> 09:42.379
[groans] All right,
we don't have much time,

09:42.380 --> 09:43.459
so listen close.

09:43.460 --> 09:44.499
You're the doughnut, Cricket.

09:44.500 --> 09:45.919
The jelly is your kapowie.

09:45.920 --> 09:47.419
Your appearance doesn't matter.

09:47.420 --> 09:49.289
It's what's on the inside
that counts.

09:49.290 --> 09:51.289
Now, if you'll excuse me-- [urp]

09:51.290 --> 09:53.419
I'm the doughnut?

09:53.420 --> 09:54.579
[gasp]

09:54.580 --> 09:56.419
I'm the doughnut!

09:56.420 --> 09:57.619
All right, let's get started.

09:57.620 --> 09:59.749
Miriam, be my muse once more

09:59.750 --> 10:01.379
- for old times' sake.
- [flirty grunts]

10:01.380 --> 10:03.169
All right! Go time!

10:03.170 --> 10:04.170
Action!

10:04.171 --> 10:05.879
[spotlight echoes]

10:05.880 --> 10:08.579
-We now carry--
-Stop the presses!

10:08.580 --> 10:10.579
- I gotta say somethin'!
- Seriously?!

10:10.580 --> 10:12.419
Say, point that camera
down at me, would ya?

10:12.420 --> 10:13.499
Hup! Ah!

10:13.500 --> 10:14.500
All this time, I thought my hair

10:14.501 --> 10:16.289
is what gave me kapowie,

10:16.290 --> 10:18.499
but I now realize
my hair doesn't define me.

10:18.500 --> 10:20.919
I may not have the topping
you all know and love,

10:20.920 --> 10:22.789
but I am full
of the same kapowie jelly

10:22.790 --> 10:24.419
I've always had!

10:24.420 --> 10:27.119
If you cut me open,
it'll all flow out!

10:27.120 --> 10:29.999
- [clapping]
- There he is!

10:30.000 --> 10:32.459
That's the firecracker
I met this morning!

10:32.460 --> 10:34.289
You've got your kapowie back!

10:34.290 --> 10:36.289
And now you can go back
to being the towel girl!

10:36.290 --> 10:37.290
Isn't that great, Gloria?

10:37.291 --> 10:38.919
Ugh! Whatever.

10:38.920 --> 10:41.209
Now what do you say
we get this ball rolling, huh?

10:41.210 --> 10:44.379
Lights, camera, action!

10:44.380 --> 10:46.289
[Donny] Are you in the mood
for some friendly service,

10:46.290 --> 10:51.079
hot coffee, and perhaps being
in the presence of an angel?

10:51.080 --> 10:53.119
Well, come on down
to Big Coffee!

10:53.120 --> 10:55.499
We now carry
scrumptious jelly doughnuts

10:55.500 --> 10:57.579
made fresh every day.

10:57.580 --> 11:01.119
[Donny] So come on down
to Big Big Big Big Big Coffee!

11:01.120 --> 11:02.420
Am I gettin' paid for this?
