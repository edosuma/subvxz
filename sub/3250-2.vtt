WEBVTT

00:01.710 --> 00:04.338
Space, 1969.

00:06.632 --> 00:07.633
No!

00:08.592 --> 00:11.061
The Doctor we saw on the beach
is a future version,

00:11.136 --> 00:13.104
200 years older than the one up there.

00:13.180 --> 00:16.434
Canton Everett Delaware III
Who's he?

00:17.184 --> 00:18.777
What the hell is that?

00:18.852 --> 00:20.525
Mr President...

00:22.648 --> 00:25.117
You didn't have to kill her,
she couldn't even remember you!

00:25.192 --> 00:26.318
How does that work?

00:26.401 --> 00:28.779
We can only remember you
while we're seeing you, is that it?

00:31.615 --> 00:32.992
Canton! Are you okay?

00:33.075 --> 00:34.702
Doctor, I'm pregnant.

00:39.581 --> 00:41.083
No!

00:47.172 --> 00:48.765
Suspect directly ahead

00:48.840 --> 00:50.387
Coming to you now. Over.

01:22.541 --> 01:24.293
- Canton.
- Miss Pond.

01:28.088 --> 01:30.466
- Is that a body bag?
- Yes, it is.

01:30.549 --> 01:32.722
- It's empty.
- How about that?

01:33.385 --> 01:35.854
Do you even know
why you're doing this, hey?

01:36.555 --> 01:38.398
Can you even remember?

01:38.890 --> 01:39.937
The warehouse?

01:40.017 --> 01:42.315
It's that monster. Amy! Amy!

01:46.189 --> 01:48.487
- What the hell's going on?
- Look behind you.

01:48.567 --> 01:50.035
There's nothing behind me!

01:50.110 --> 01:52.283
Look! Canton, look!

01:52.362 --> 01:53.909
Canton.

02:03.165 --> 02:06.840
All visitors
to remain behind the yellow line.

02:06.918 --> 02:10.172
All visitors to remain behind
the yellow line.

02:10.255 --> 02:11.848
We found Amy Pond.

02:11.923 --> 02:15.769
She had strange markings on her arm.

02:17.638 --> 02:19.060
Do you know what they are?

02:21.683 --> 02:23.526
Why don't you ask her?

02:57.678 --> 02:59.021
I see you.

03:01.181 --> 03:03.183
I see you!

03:07.020 --> 03:09.239
Dr Song.

03:09.773 --> 03:11.320
Dr Song!

03:17.072 --> 03:18.574
Go, go, go!

03:20.617 --> 03:22.085
Don't move!

03:27.249 --> 03:30.093
- It's over.
- They' re here, Canton.

03:30.168 --> 03:32.296
- They're everywhere.
- I know.

03:32.379 --> 03:35.883
- America's being invaded.
- You were invaded a long time ago.

03:35.966 --> 03:37.809
America is occupied.

03:37.884 --> 03:41.730
You're coming with us, Dr Song.
There's no way out this time.

03:44.141 --> 03:45.734
There's always a way out.

03:56.236 --> 03:57.863
We found Dr Song.

03:58.488 --> 04:00.490
These bricks, what are they made of?

04:01.241 --> 04:03.084
- Where is she?
- She ran.

04:03.994 --> 04:05.712
Off the 50th floor.

04:08.248 --> 04:10.876
I'd say zero-balanced dwarf star alloy.

04:11.877 --> 04:15.006
The densest material in the universe.
Nothing gets through that.

04:16.339 --> 04:18.512
You're building me the perfect prison.

04:22.679 --> 04:24.898
And it still won't be enough.

04:40.655 --> 04:43.158
- What are you waiting for?
- I'm waiting for you to run.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.289
It'd look better if I shot you
while you were running.

04:45.368 --> 04:48.463
Then again, looks aren't everything.

04:56.463 --> 04:58.636
Is there a reason you're doing this?

04:58.715 --> 05:02.185
I want you to know where you stand.
In a cell.

05:02.260 --> 05:05.434
In a perfect cell.
Nothing can penetrate these walls.

05:05.514 --> 05:08.108
Not a sound, not a radio wave.

05:11.770 --> 05:13.989
Not the tiniest particle of anything.

05:14.022 --> 05:17.617
In here, you are literally cut off
from the rest of the universe.

05:23.532 --> 05:25.250
So I guess they can't hear us, right?

05:25.325 --> 05:27.669
- Good work, Canton. Door sealed?
- You bet.

05:33.750 --> 05:35.627
- You okay?
- Finally.

05:35.710 --> 05:38.133
These things
could really do with air holes.

05:38.213 --> 05:39.430
Never had a complaint before.

05:39.506 --> 05:41.429
Isn't it going to look odd that
you're staying in here with us?

05:41.508 --> 05:42.680
Odd, but not alarming.

05:42.759 --> 05:43.806
They know
there's no way out of this place.

05:43.885 --> 05:46.013
Exactly. Whatever they might think
we're doing in here,

05:46.096 --> 05:48.519
they know we're not going anywhere.

05:52.227 --> 05:53.524
Shall we?

05:54.688 --> 05:56.031
What about Dr Song?

05:56.106 --> 05:58.825
- She dove off a rooftop!
- Don't worry. She does that.

05:58.900 --> 06:02.154
Amy, Rory,
open all the doors to the swimming pool.

06:09.536 --> 06:10.662
So, we know they're everywhere.

06:10.745 --> 06:12.793
Not just a landing party,
an occupying force.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.251
And they've been here
a very, very long time.

06:15.333 --> 06:17.335
But nobody knows that,
'cause no one can remember them.

06:17.419 --> 06:18.545
- So what are they up to?
- No idea.

06:18.628 --> 06:22.553
But the good news is...
we've got a secret weapon.

06:28.513 --> 06:30.265
Apollo 11's your secret weapon?

06:30.348 --> 06:33.978
No, no, it's not Apollo 77,
that would be silly.

06:34.936 --> 06:37.155
It's Neil Armstrong's foot.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.948
In just a few days
mankind will set foot on the moon

07:24.027 --> 07:25.700
for the first time.

07:25.779 --> 07:29.534
Today the President reaffirmed
America's commitment...

07:30.825 --> 07:32.748
Ready. Check.

07:32.827 --> 07:35.546
- Clear.
- Clear.

07:40.502 --> 07:42.220
- Ow!
- Ha! So, three months.

07:42.295 --> 07:45.048
- What have we found out?
- Well, they are everywhere.

07:45.131 --> 07:48.977
- Every state in America. Ow!
- Not just America, the entire world.

07:49.052 --> 07:51.555
There's a greater concentration
here, though.

07:51.638 --> 07:52.685
Ow!

07:53.431 --> 07:54.648
You okay?

07:56.643 --> 07:58.896
- All better.
- Better?

07:58.979 --> 08:01.698
Turns out I was wrong.
I'm... I'm not pregnant.

08:03.191 --> 08:05.068
- What's up?
- Nothing.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.119
Really, nothing, seriously.

08:07.195 --> 08:09.618
So you've seen them,
but you don't remember them.

08:09.698 --> 08:13.498
You've seen them, too.
That night at the warehouse, remember?

08:13.576 --> 08:15.203
While you were pretending
to hunt us down,

08:15.286 --> 08:18.506
we saw hundreds of those things.
We still don't know what they look like.

08:18.581 --> 08:21.050
It's like they edit themselves
out of your memory

08:21.126 --> 08:22.218
as soon as you look away.

08:22.293 --> 08:25.046
The exact second you're not looking
at them, you can't remember anything.

08:25.130 --> 08:27.508
Sometimes you feel a bit sick, though,
but not always.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.058
So that's why you marked your skin?

08:29.134 --> 08:31.011
Only way we'd know
if we'd had an encounter.

08:31.094 --> 08:32.095
How long have they been here?

08:32.178 --> 08:34.897
That's what we've spent the last
three months trying to find out.

08:34.972 --> 08:37.476
Not easy, if you can't remember
anything you discover.

08:37.558 --> 08:38.559
But how long do you think?

08:38.643 --> 08:40.441
As long as there's been something
in the corner of your eye

08:40.520 --> 08:42.864
or creaking in your house
or breathing under your bed

08:42.938 --> 08:44.941
or voices through a wall.

08:46.860 --> 08:48.612
They've been running your lives
for a very long time now,

08:48.695 --> 08:53.576
so keep this straight in your head.
We are not fighting an alien invasion.

08:55.910 --> 09:00.507
We're leading a revolution.
And today the battle begins.

09:00.540 --> 09:02.213
- How?
- Like this.

09:03.626 --> 09:04.969
Ow!

09:05.837 --> 09:10.013
Nano recorder.
Fuses with the cartilage in your hand.

09:11.217 --> 09:14.187
Ow! Then it tunes itself directly
to the speech centers in your brain.

09:14.220 --> 09:16.973
It'll pick up your voice,
no matter what. Telepathic connection.

09:17.057 --> 09:21.483
So, the moment you see
one of the creatures, you activate it

09:22.353 --> 09:24.572
and describe aloud
exactly what you're seeing.

09:26.483 --> 09:28.281
And describe aloud
exactly what you're seeing.

09:28.359 --> 09:31.704
Because the moment you break contact,
you're going to forget it happened.

09:31.780 --> 09:33.908
The light will flash if
you've left yourself a message.

09:33.990 --> 09:36.539
You keep checking your hand.

09:36.618 --> 09:38.712
If you've had an encounter,
that's the first you'll know about it.

09:38.787 --> 09:40.255
Why didn't you tell me this
before we started?

09:40.330 --> 09:43.925
I did. But even information about
these creatures erases itself over time.

09:45.877 --> 09:47.504
I couldn't refresh it
'cause I couldn't talk to you.

09:53.802 --> 09:54.928
What?

09:56.679 --> 09:58.932
- What are you staring at?
- Look at your hand.

10:02.227 --> 10:03.228
Why's it doing that?

10:03.311 --> 10:06.155
What does it mean if the light's
flashing? What did I just tell you?

10:06.231 --> 10:08.154
- I haven't...
- Play it.

10:12.112 --> 10:14.285
My God, how did it get in here?

10:15.615 --> 10:17.959
Keep eye contact with
the creature and when I say,

10:18.034 --> 10:22.039
tum back and when you do,
straighten my bow tie.

10:22.580 --> 10:24.674
What? What are you staring at?

10:24.749 --> 10:26.501
Look at your hand

10:30.380 --> 10:33.179
It's a hologram, extrapolated
from the photo on Amy's phone.

10:33.258 --> 10:35.101
Take a good long look.

10:36.344 --> 10:38.893
You just saw an image
of one of the creatures we're fighting.

10:38.972 --> 10:40.849
Describe it to me.

10:40.932 --> 10:42.559
- I can't.
- No.

10:44.060 --> 10:45.562
Neither can I.

10:46.521 --> 10:49.274
You straightened my bow tie
because I planted the idea in your head

10:49.357 --> 10:51.735
- while you were looking at the creature.
- So they could do that to people.

10:51.818 --> 10:53.912
You could be doing stuff and
not really knowing why you're doing it.

10:53.987 --> 10:55.864
Like post-hypnotic suggestion.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.991
Ruling the world
with post-hypnotic suggestion?

10:58.074 --> 10:59.576
Now then, a little girl in a space suit.

10:59.659 --> 11:01.457
They got the suit from NASA,
but where did they get the girl?

11:01.536 --> 11:02.708
- Could be anywhere.
- Except they probably stayed

11:02.787 --> 11:05.131
close to that warehouse,
'cause why bother doing anything else?

11:05.206 --> 11:06.628
And they take her from somewhere

11:06.749 --> 11:08.922
that will cause
the least amount of attention.

11:09.002 --> 11:11.346
But you'll have to find her.
I'm off to NASA.

11:11.421 --> 11:13.549
Find her? Where do we look?

11:15.258 --> 11:16.680
Children's homes.

11:19.387 --> 11:21.264
- Hello?
- FBI.

11:21.347 --> 11:23.190
You must be Dr Renfrew. Can we come in?

11:23.266 --> 11:26.270
- The children are asleep.
- We'll be very quiet.

11:26.352 --> 11:28.946
Is there a problem?

11:29.522 --> 11:31.741
- It's about a missing child.
- Well, what are you...

11:33.193 --> 11:35.241
Yes, yes, come in, please.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.495
This way.

11:41.409 --> 11:45.585
Please excuse the writing. It...
 ...keeps happening.

11:45.622 --> 11:48.341
I try to clean it up.

11:51.711 --> 11:55.181
- It's the kids, yeah? They do that?
- Yes. The children.

11:55.256 --> 11:57.850
It must be, yes.

12:00.762 --> 12:04.812
Anyway, my office is this way.

12:10.021 --> 12:12.365
We nearly didn't come to this place.

12:12.440 --> 12:16.115
I understood Graystark Hall
was closed in '67.

12:16.194 --> 12:19.789
- That's the plan, yes.
- The plan?

12:19.822 --> 12:22.416
- Not long now.
- It's 1969.

12:22.492 --> 12:26.417
Uh, no, no. We close in '67.
That's the plan, yes.

12:26.496 --> 12:28.043
You misunderstood me, sir.

12:28.122 --> 12:30.375
It's 1969 now.

12:30.458 --> 12:32.460
Why are you saying that?
Of course it isn't.

12:32.543 --> 12:33.669
]July.

12:36.923 --> 12:39.767
My office is this way,
this way.

12:43.846 --> 12:46.144
- I'll check upstairs.
- Be careful.

13:14.252 --> 13:17.472
Amy?

13:17.839 --> 13:19.762
I think we've found the place
she was taken from.

13:19.841 --> 13:21.639
- How do you know?
- 'Cause those things have been here.

13:21.718 --> 13:23.061
But the whole place is deserted

13:23.136 --> 13:25.514
There's just one guy here
and I think he's lost it.

13:25.596 --> 13:27.348
Repeated memory wipes
fry your head eventually.

13:27.432 --> 13:29.855
Find out what you can
but don't hang around.

13:29.934 --> 13:30.935
Where are you?

13:31.019 --> 13:33.067
Gotta go. Got company.

13:33.813 --> 13:36.487
Don't worry. I put everything
back the way I found out.

13:36.566 --> 13:39.991
Oh, except this. There's always a bit
left over, isn't there?

14:13.186 --> 14:17.066
I can see them, but I think
they're asleep. Get out! just get out!

15:23.589 --> 15:25.091
Now, one more time, sir.

15:25.174 --> 15:27.222
How the hell did you get
into the command module?

15:27.301 --> 15:28.393
I told you!

15:28.469 --> 15:31.769
I'm on a top-secret mission
for the President.

15:32.598 --> 15:35.943
Well, maybe if you'd just get President
Nixon to assure us of that, sir,

15:36.018 --> 15:37.770
that would be swell.

15:38.938 --> 15:40.736
I sent him a message.

15:44.318 --> 15:48.198
Hello. I believe it's Mr Gardner,
is that correct? Head of security?

15:48.281 --> 15:50.158
Ah, yes, sir. Yes, Mr President.

15:50.241 --> 15:52.710
- Mr Grant, is it?
- Yes, Mr President.

15:53.244 --> 15:56.373
The hopes and dreams of millions
of Americans stand here today,

15:56.456 --> 15:59.630
at Cape Kennedy, and you're
the men who guard those dreams.

16:00.376 --> 16:02.799
On behalf of the American people,
I thank you.

16:02.879 --> 16:04.131
You're welcome, Mr President.

16:04.213 --> 16:06.432
I understand you have a baby on the way,
Mr Grant?

16:06.507 --> 16:07.508
Yes, Mr President.

16:07.592 --> 16:09.890
What are you hoping for,
a boy or a girl?

16:09.969 --> 16:11.596
Just a healthy American, sir.

16:11.679 --> 16:15.104
A healthy American will do just nicely.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.644
Now, fellas, listen. This man here,

16:17.768 --> 16:21.147
codename The Doctor, is doing
some work for me personally.

16:21.647 --> 16:23.945
Could you, uh, cut him a little slack?

16:23.983 --> 16:27.032
Er, Mr President,
he did break into Apollo 77.

16:30.198 --> 16:34.078
Well, I'm sure he had
a very good reason for that.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.413
Uh, but I need you to release him now,
so he can get on

16:36.496 --> 16:38.919
with some very important work
for the American people.

16:38.998 --> 16:41.797
- Could you do that for me?
- Well...

16:41.876 --> 16:44.800
Son, I am your Commander in Chief.

16:44.879 --> 16:47.473
Uh, then I guess that would be fine,
Mr President.

16:47.548 --> 16:49.175
Glad to hear it.

16:52.637 --> 16:55.436
Thank you! Bye-bye.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.062
Carry on, gentlemen.

17:10.488 --> 17:12.707
America salutes you.

17:26.420 --> 17:30.846
This place, it's been closed for years.
What have you been doing?

17:32.009 --> 17:34.478
Oh, the child,

17:35.263 --> 17:37.561
she must be cared for.

17:37.640 --> 17:39.142
It's important.

17:39.767 --> 17:41.110
That's what they said.

17:42.061 --> 17:43.187
That's what who said?

17:57.410 --> 17:59.583
Hello. Who are you?

18:00.621 --> 18:02.919
No, I think she's just dreaming.

18:16.971 --> 18:19.474
Hello?
I saw you looking through the hatch...

19:10.399 --> 19:13.869
How... How can that be me?

19:26.040 --> 19:29.965
Who are you? I don't understand,
so just tell me who you are!

19:40.096 --> 19:43.851
I'm sorry. I didn't mean to shoot you.

19:43.933 --> 19:45.606
I'm glad I missed.

19:46.352 --> 19:50.323
But you killed the Doctor.
Or you're...you're going to kill him.

19:51.607 --> 19:53.530
But who are you?

19:53.609 --> 19:56.408
Just please tell me,
because I don't understand!

19:56.487 --> 19:57.989
Please help me.

19:58.572 --> 20:01.542
Help me, please.

20:18.551 --> 20:21.680
Oh. It's just some questions.

20:23.180 --> 20:24.523
Yes, I see.

20:27.685 --> 20:30.564
Who was that? Dr Renfrew?

20:32.898 --> 20:34.320
Who was that?

20:35.484 --> 20:36.861
Who was who?

20:46.036 --> 20:49.085
What are you? You can tell me.

20:50.166 --> 20:51.418
'Cause I won't remember.

20:52.293 --> 20:54.796
You invaded us. You're everywhere.

20:54.879 --> 20:59.180
Help me! Please.
Canton, please, will you help me!

20:59.508 --> 21:03.058
- Are you armed?
- This world is ours.

21:03.137 --> 21:06.983
We have ruled it
since the wheel and the fire.

21:07.057 --> 21:10.607
- We have no need of weapons.
- Yeah?

21:14.482 --> 21:15.950
Welcome to America.

21:16.275 --> 21:17.492
Amy!

21:18.486 --> 21:21.831
You have to tape everything
that happens in this office, every word.

21:21.906 --> 21:23.374
Or we won't know
if you're under the influence.

21:23.449 --> 21:25.577
Doctor, you have to give me
more than this.

21:25.659 --> 21:27.832
- What were you doing to Apollo 77?
- A thing. A clever thing.

21:27.912 --> 21:31.542
Now, no more questions.
You have to trust me and nobody else.

21:32.333 --> 21:34.085
Doctor! It's Canton!

21:34.960 --> 21:36.678
Quick, he needs us!

21:41.801 --> 21:45.601
Help me! Please, I can 'ti..
I can't see! Somebody help me!

21:45.679 --> 21:46.851
Amy!

21:47.848 --> 21:49.646
Amy, can you hear me?

21:50.226 --> 21:54.026
Amy, I'm going to try to blow the lock.
I need you to stand back.

21:54.480 --> 21:57.199
- Okay, gun down, I've got it!
- Amy, we're here. Are you okay?

21:57.274 --> 22:00.744
I can't see!

22:06.700 --> 22:08.327
Where is she, Doctor?

22:14.416 --> 22:17.636
- It's empty.
- It's dark, so dark.

22:18.337 --> 22:22.058
I don’t know where I am.
 Please, can anybody hear me?

22:28.931 --> 22:30.933
They took this out of her.

22:31.016 --> 22:33.110
How did they do that, Doctor?

22:35.729 --> 22:37.857
And, and... Why can I still hear her?

22:39.650 --> 22:41.323
Is it a recording?

22:45.239 --> 22:47.992
Um, it defaults to live.
This is current.

22:50.119 --> 22:52.247
Wherever she is right now,
this is what she's saying.

22:52.329 --> 22:54.297
Amy, can you hear me?
We're coming for you.

22:55.332 --> 22:57.426
Wherever you are, we're coming, I swear.

22:57.501 --> 22:59.128
She can't hear you.

23:00.629 --> 23:02.723
I'm so sorry. It's one-way.

23:03.716 --> 23:06.014
She can always hear me, Doctor.

23:06.760 --> 23:09.229
Always, wherever she is.

23:09.305 --> 23:12.650
And she always knows that I am coming
for her, do you understand me?

23:14.852 --> 23:16.069
Always.

23:17.938 --> 23:20.282
Doctor; are you out there?

23:21.275 --> 23:24.324
Can you hear me? Doctor?

23:26.196 --> 23:31.373
Oh, God. Please, please, Doctor,
just get me out of this.

23:31.744 --> 23:34.167
He's coming. I'll bring him, I swear.

23:35.164 --> 23:38.919
Hello, is somebody there? Who...

23:39.668 --> 23:42.421
I, I think someone has been shot.

23:42.504 --> 23:45.098
I think we should help. We...

23:47.843 --> 23:50.346
I can't... I can't remember.

24:02.858 --> 24:03.950
Okay.

24:06.028 --> 24:07.996
Who and what are you?

24:08.072 --> 24:11.576
Silence, Doctor.

24:13.327 --> 24:16.752
We are the Silence.

24:17.957 --> 24:19.880
Silence, Doctor.

24:19.959 --> 24:21.176
- Row, listen to that.
- Silence?

24:21.251 --> 24:23.424
- We ran from the Silence?
- Silence.

24:23.462 --> 24:27.183
And Silence will fall.

24:44.942 --> 24:48.037
- Hello, again.
- Sir, you've been in there for days.

24:48.112 --> 24:50.615
- What the hell have you been doing?
- Doesn't matter.

24:50.698 --> 24:51.950
I need Dr Shepherd here right now.

24:52.032 --> 24:54.330
Sir, I need to talk to Colonel Jefferson
right now.

24:54.410 --> 24:56.378
No, you really don't.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.293
Uh...

25:03.669 --> 25:04.670
Hi, fellas.

25:07.840 --> 25:10.013
I'm President Nixon.

25:10.467 --> 25:13.016
I want to tell you,
on behalf of the American people,

25:13.095 --> 25:15.314
how much we appreciate
all of your hard work.

25:15.848 --> 25:17.942
The target
for the Apollo 11 astronaut.;

25:18.017 --> 25:24.024
The moon, at liftoff, will be
at a distance of 218,096 miles away

25:24.106 --> 25:26.484
We Te just past
the two-minute mark on the countdown.

25:26.567 --> 25:29.787
T minus one minute 54 seconds
and counting.

25:29.820 --> 25:31.538
Our status board indicates...

25:31.613 --> 25:34.617
It's an exo-skeleton.
Basically, life support.

25:35.075 --> 25:38.750
There's about 20 different kinds
of alien tech in here.

25:39.329 --> 25:41.548
Who was she? Why put her in here?

25:41.623 --> 25:43.500
Put this on,
you don't even need to eat.

25:44.126 --> 25:47.630
The suit processes sunlight directly.
It's got built-in weaponry

25:47.713 --> 25:50.216
and a communications system
that can hack into anything.

25:50.299 --> 25:51.846
Including the telephone network?

25:51.925 --> 25:53.973
- Easily.
- But why phone the President?

25:54.053 --> 25:56.556
It defaults to the highest authority
it can find.

25:56.638 --> 25:57.935
The little girl gets frightened,

25:58.015 --> 26:00.393
the most powerful man on Earth
gets a phone call.

26:01.018 --> 26:03.942
The night terrors
with a hotline to the White House.

26:07.149 --> 26:09.243
You won't learn anything
from that envelope, you know.

26:09.318 --> 26:12.618
Purchased on Earth, perfectly
ordinary stationery, Tardis blue.

26:12.696 --> 26:15.245
Summoned by a stranger
who won't even show his face.

26:15.324 --> 26:17.167
That's a first for me. How about you?

26:20.204 --> 26:21.956
Our lives are back to front.

26:22.039 --> 26:24.883
Your future's my past,
your firsts are my lasts.

26:24.958 --> 26:27.336
- Not really what I asked.
- Ask something else, then.

26:27.419 --> 26:29.262
What are the Silence doing?
Raising a child?

26:29.338 --> 26:31.386
Keeping her safe.
Even giving her independence.

26:31.465 --> 26:33.718
The only way to save Amy is to work out
what the Silence are doing.

26:33.801 --> 26:35.849
- I know.
- Every single thing we learn about them

26:35.928 --> 26:39.228
- brings us a step closer.
- Yeah, Doctor, I get it, I know.

26:39.306 --> 26:41.684
Of course, it's possible
she's not just any little girl.

26:41.767 --> 26:45.021
Well, I'd say she's human,
going by the life support software.

26:45.062 --> 26:47.565
- But?
- She climbed out of this suit.

26:48.315 --> 26:51.990
Like, she forced her way out.
She must be incredibly strong.

26:52.069 --> 26:54.743
Incredibly strong and running away.
I like her.

26:54.780 --> 26:58.159
- We should be trying to find her.
- Yes, I know, but how?

26:58.242 --> 27:00.244
Anyway, I have the strangest feeling
she's going to find us.

27:00.327 --> 27:03.297
Apollo 11,
this is Houston, do you read? Oven

27:05.124 --> 27:07.377
Why does it look like a NASA space suit?

27:07.459 --> 27:09.928
Because that's what the Silence do.
Think about it.

27:10.003 --> 27:11.550
They don't make anything themselves.

27:11.630 --> 27:14.053
They don't have to. They get
other life forms to do it for them.

27:14.133 --> 27:15.976
- So they're parasites, then?
- Super parasites.

27:16.093 --> 27:18.437
Standing in the shadows of human history
since the very beginning.

27:18.512 --> 27:20.810
We know they can influence
human behaviour any way they want.

27:20.889 --> 27:23.984
If they've been doing that on
a global scale for thousands of years...

27:24.059 --> 27:25.481
Then what?

27:25.978 --> 27:28.948
Then why did the human race
suddenly decide to go to the moon?

27:28.981 --> 27:30.949
Ten, nine,

27:31.024 --> 27:35.404
ignition sequence start,
six, five, four...

27:35.487 --> 27:38.081
Because the Silence needed a space suit.

27:38.157 --> 27:41.957
one, zero,
all engines firing.

27:42.035 --> 27:44.129
Liftoff. We have a liftoff

27:44.204 --> 27:48.004
Thirty-two minutes past the hour,
liftoff on Apollo 11.

27:54.131 --> 27:55.849
My God!

27:57.426 --> 28:00.100
- What is it?
- It's just an alien, Dr Shepherd.

28:00.179 --> 28:04.434
- Someone's already been treating it.
- Yeah. You've been treating it.

28:04.516 --> 28:06.769
Does Colonel Jefferson know
this thing is here?

28:06.852 --> 28:10.607
- No.
- Then I'm going to tell him right now!

28:10.689 --> 28:13.784
- Again?
- Sorry, what?

28:14.735 --> 28:15.952
Exactly.

28:16.486 --> 28:19.410
Sergeant, why was I called in here
for no reason?

28:20.365 --> 28:23.414
You tend to my wounds.

28:23.994 --> 28:26.247
You are foolish.

28:26.914 --> 28:29.838
Why? What would you do in my place?

28:29.917 --> 28:34.923
We have ruled your lives
since your lives began.

28:35.005 --> 28:37.804
You should kill us all on sight,

28:37.883 --> 28:42.229
but you will never remember
we were even here.

28:42.596 --> 28:45.019
Your will is ours.

28:45.098 --> 28:49.945
Yeah, well, sorry to disappoint you,
but thanks.

28:50.020 --> 28:51.943
It's exactly what I needed to hear.

28:52.606 --> 28:56.406
This is a video phone.
Whatever a video phone is.

29:03.450 --> 29:06.329
You should kill us all on sight

29:14.670 --> 29:18.720
This suit, it seems to be
repairing itself. How is it doing that?

29:18.799 --> 29:20.847
Doctor, a unit like this,

29:20.926 --> 29:23.930
would it ever be able to move
without an occupant?

29:24.012 --> 29:25.764
- Why?
- Well, the little girl said

29:25.847 --> 29:28.350
the spaceman was coming to eat her.

29:28.850 --> 29:30.477
Maybe that's exactly what happened.

29:32.854 --> 29:34.481
I love you.

29:35.315 --> 29:36.862
I know you think it's him.

29:37.693 --> 29:42.824
I know you think it ought to be him.
But it's not, it's you.

29:44.032 --> 29:45.249
And when I see you again

29:45.325 --> 29:50.422
I'm going to tell you properly
just to see your stupid face.

29:51.206 --> 29:56.588
My life was so boring before you
just dropped out of the sky

29:57.421 --> 30:01.301
So just get your stupid
face where I can see it. Okay?

30:02.301 --> 30:05.555
Okay?

30:06.763 --> 30:10.939
She'll be safe for now.
No point in a dead hostage.

30:13.895 --> 30:15.613
Can't you save her?

30:16.106 --> 30:17.949
I can track that signal back.
Take us right to her.

30:18.025 --> 30:20.198
- Then why haven't you?
- Because then what?

30:20.861 --> 30:22.238
I find her and then what do I do?

30:22.321 --> 30:24.619
This isn't an alien invasion,
they live here.

30:24.698 --> 30:27.542
This is their empire.

30:27.617 --> 30:30.166
This is kicking the Romans out of Rome.

30:31.621 --> 30:32.588
Rome fell.

30:33.498 --> 30:35.717
I know. I was there.

30:38.378 --> 30:39.630
So was I.

30:42.257 --> 30:43.930
Personal question.

30:44.051 --> 30:46.019
Seriously, you?

30:51.224 --> 30:53.192
Do you ever remember it?

30:53.560 --> 30:55.779
2,000 years, waiting for Amy?

30:57.022 --> 30:58.774
The Last Centurion?

31:02.194 --> 31:03.992
- No.
- Are you lying?

31:05.614 --> 31:07.867
- Course I'm lying.
- Course you are.

31:07.949 --> 31:10.543
Not the sort of thing anyone forgets.

31:10.619 --> 31:13.122
But I don't remember it all the time.

31:14.956 --> 31:18.335
It's like there's a door in my head.

31:18.418 --> 31:20.921
I can keep it shut.

31:21.004 --> 31:23.848
Please, please, please come and get me.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.014
Come and get me.

31:30.722 --> 31:32.850
Okay, all flight controllers,
Go/NO-Go for landing?

31:32.933 --> 31:37.530
just five days since
Apollo 11 blasted off from Cape Kennedy

31:37.604 --> 31:41.950
this unprecedented journey
is reaching its crucial moment

31:42.025 --> 31:44.448
Armstrong and Aldring
are making their descent

31:44.528 --> 31:46.075
to the surface of the moon.

31:46.154 --> 31:47.201
on the ground

31:47.280 --> 31:49.453
You got a bunch of guys
about to turn blue.

32:01.670 --> 32:04.014
Where am I? Where is this?

32:10.095 --> 32:12.439
You are Amelia Pond.

32:14.015 --> 32:16.109
You're ugly,
has anyone mentioned that to you?

32:16.184 --> 32:18.983
We do you honour.

32:19.020 --> 32:22.991
You will bring the Silence.

32:23.483 --> 32:26.111
But your part will soon be over.

32:26.194 --> 32:28.663
Whatever that means, you've made
a big mistake bringing me here,

32:28.738 --> 32:31.537
'cause wait till you see
what's coming for you now.

32:31.616 --> 32:35.166
You have been here many days.

32:35.245 --> 32:38.215
No. I just got here.
You just put me in here.

32:38.290 --> 32:42.545
Your memory is weak.
You have been here many days.

32:42.627 --> 32:44.971
No. No, I can't have been.

32:46.089 --> 32:48.717
You will sleep now.

32:50.218 --> 32:51.515
Sleep.

32:51.636 --> 32:54.014
- No! No! Get off me!
- Sleep.

32:54.097 --> 32:56.725
- No! No! No!
- Sleep.

33:03.064 --> 33:04.862
Oh! Interesting.

33:05.692 --> 33:08.616
Very Aickman Road,
I've seen one of these before.

33:08.695 --> 33:11.073
Abandoned. Wonder how that happened?

33:11.156 --> 33:12.749
Oh, well!
I suppose I'm about to find out.

33:12.782 --> 33:16.332
Rory, River,
keep one Silent in eyeshot at all times.

33:16.411 --> 33:18.664
Oh, hello, sorry.
You're in the middle of something.

33:18.747 --> 33:21.125
Just had to say, though,
have you seen what's on the telly?

33:21.208 --> 33:24.052
Oh, hello, Amy, you all right?
Want to watch some television?

33:24.127 --> 33:26.425
Ah, now, stay where you are.

33:27.964 --> 33:29.386
'Cause look at me, I'm confident.

33:30.133 --> 33:32.852
You want to watch that, me,
when I'm confident.

33:32.928 --> 33:34.020
Oh, and this is my friend River.

33:34.095 --> 33:35.972
Nice hair, clever, has her own gun,

33:36.056 --> 33:39.276
and unlike me, she really doesn't mind
shooting people. I shouldn't like that

33:39.351 --> 33:41.103
- but I kind of do a bit.
- Thank you, sweetie.

33:41.186 --> 33:42.688
I know you're team players
and everything,

33:42.771 --> 33:44.899
but she'll definitely kill
at least the first three of you.

33:44.981 --> 33:47.029
- Well, the first seven, easily.
- Seven, really?

33:47.108 --> 33:49.031
- Oh, eight for you, honey.
- Stop it.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.158
- Make me!
- Yeah, well, maybe I will.

33:51.238 --> 33:52.581
Is this really important, flirting?

33:52.656 --> 33:54.499
'Cause I feel like I should be
higher on the list right now.

33:54.574 --> 33:55.666
Yes, right. Sorry.

33:55.700 --> 33:57.452
As I was saying, my naughty friend here

33:57.536 --> 34:00.130
is going to kill the first three of you
to attack, plus him behind.

34:00.205 --> 34:02.583
So maybe you want to draw lots
or have a quiz.

34:02.666 --> 34:04.760
- What's he got?
- Something, I hope.

34:04.834 --> 34:06.177
Or maybe
you could just listen a minute,

34:06.253 --> 34:09.177
because all I really want to do
is accept your total surrender

34:09.255 --> 34:11.554
and then I'll let you go in peace. Yes.

34:11.632 --> 34:14.101
You've been interfering in human
history for thousands of years. Yes.

34:14.177 --> 34:17.397
People have suffered and died.
But what's the point in two hearts

34:17.472 --> 34:19.770
if you can't be a bit forgiving
now and then?

34:20.433 --> 34:22.856
Ooh! The Silence.

34:23.228 --> 34:26.902
You guys take that seriously, don't you?
Okay, you got me, I'm lying.

34:26.940 --> 34:28.283
I'm not really going to let you go
that easily.

34:28.358 --> 34:32.534
Nice thought, but it's not Christmas.
First, you tell me about the girl.

34:32.612 --> 34:35.786
Who is she? Why is she important?
What's she for?

34:36.992 --> 34:39.245
Yeah, we Te getting
a picture of it here.

34:40.579 --> 34:42.956
Guys, sorry,

34:43.039 --> 34:45.132
but you're way out of time.

34:45.208 --> 34:47.051
Now, come on, a bit of history for you.

34:47.127 --> 34:50.097
Aren't you proud? Because you helped.

34:50.170 --> 34:53.391
Now, do you know how many people
are watching this live on the telly?

34:53.466 --> 34:56.310
Half a billion, and that's nothing,
'cause the human race

34:56.386 --> 34:58.684
will spread out among the stars,
you just watch them fly.

34:58.763 --> 35:02.108
Billions and billions of them,
for billions and billions of years.

35:02.142 --> 35:04.520
And every single one of them
at some point in their lives

35:04.603 --> 35:07.948
will look back at this man,
ta king that very first step,

35:07.981 --> 35:10.905
and they will never, ever forget it.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.446
Okay Engine stopped
ACA out of detent.

35:15.405 --> 35:17.828
Descent Engine Command Override, off

35:17.907 --> 35:20.706
Oh. But they'll forget this bit.

35:22.871 --> 35:24.339
- Ready?
- Ready.

35:31.296 --> 35:33.845
it? one small step
for man.-.

35:33.923 --> 35:36.927
You should kill us all
on sight.

35:39.596 --> 35:42.520
You should kill us all on sight

35:44.851 --> 35:47.479
You should kill us all on sight

35:49.147 --> 35:51.866
You should kill us all on sight

35:51.941 --> 35:54.569
You've given the order
for your own execution,

35:54.653 --> 35:56.997
and the whole planet just heard you.

35:57.947 --> 36:00.826
You should kill us all on sight

36:00.909 --> 36:03.833
one giant leap
for mankind

36:03.912 --> 36:08.213
And one whacking great
kick up the backside for the Silence!

36:08.541 --> 36:11.545
You just raised an army
against yourself.

36:11.628 --> 36:14.222
And now, for a thousand generations,

36:14.297 --> 36:17.642
you're going to be ordering
them to destroy you every day.

36:17.717 --> 36:19.515
How fast can you run?

36:19.594 --> 36:22.768
'Cause today's the day the human race
throw you off their planet.

36:22.847 --> 36:25.100
They won't even know they're doing it.

36:25.141 --> 36:28.315
I think quite possibly the word
you're looking for right now is,

36:28.395 --> 36:32.445
"Oops!" Run! Guys, I mean us. Run!

36:38.863 --> 36:40.991
- I can't get her out!
- Go, just go!

36:41.074 --> 36:42.872
We are not leaving without you!

36:42.951 --> 36:45.955
Will you just get your stupid face
out of here!

36:49.541 --> 36:52.044
Run! Into the Tardis, quickly!

37:07.058 --> 37:08.480
Don't let them build to full power!

37:08.560 --> 37:11.734
I know! There's a reason why
I'm shooting, honey!

37:13.481 --> 37:15.449
- What are you doing?
- Helping.

37:15.525 --> 37:18.028
You've got a screwdriver.
Go build a cabinet!

37:18.111 --> 37:20.830
- That's really rude!
- Shut up and drive!

37:44.429 --> 37:49.060
My old fella didn't see that, did he?
He gets ever so cross.

37:50.685 --> 37:54.986
- So, what kind of doctor are you?
- Archeology.

37:59.360 --> 38:00.782
Love a tomb.

38:05.033 --> 38:06.751
You can let me fly it!

38:06.826 --> 38:09.204
Yeah, or we could go
where we're supposed to.

38:10.121 --> 38:12.749
- What's the matter with you?
- You called me stupid.

38:12.832 --> 38:15.836
- I always call you stupid.
- No, but...

38:16.836 --> 38:18.088
My face.

38:27.722 --> 38:29.349
I wasn't sure who you
were talking about.

38:29.432 --> 38:32.936
- You know, me or...
- Him?

38:33.603 --> 38:34.980
Well, you did say
"dropped out of the sky".

38:35.021 --> 38:37.399
It's a figure of speech, moron!

38:46.574 --> 38:48.702
- Thanks.
- You're welcome.

38:51.037 --> 38:53.916
So we're safe again.

38:53.998 --> 38:56.251
Safe? No, of course you're not safe.

38:56.334 --> 38:57.756
There's about a billion other things
out there

38:57.836 --> 38:59.429
just waiting to burn your whole world.

38:59.462 --> 39:01.430
But if you want to pretend you're safe

39:01.506 --> 39:04.305
just so you can sleep at night,
okay, you're safe.

39:04.342 --> 39:06.219
But you're not really.

39:06.511 --> 39:09.731
- Canton. Till the next one, eh?
- Looking forward to it.

39:09.806 --> 39:12.184
Canton just wants to get married.

39:12.600 --> 39:14.477
Helluva reason
to kick him out of the FBI.

39:14.561 --> 39:16.154
I'm sure something can be arranged.

39:16.229 --> 39:18.698
- I'm counting on you.
- Er, Doctor...

39:20.066 --> 39:22.410
Canton here tells me you're...

39:24.279 --> 39:25.952
You're from the future.

39:26.781 --> 39:29.159
Hardly seems possible,
but I was wondering...

39:29.242 --> 39:31.165
Should warn you.
I don't answer a lot of questions.

39:31.244 --> 39:34.418
But I'm a president
at the beginning of his time.

39:35.957 --> 39:37.334
Dare I ask?

39:38.126 --> 39:39.924
Will I be remembered?

39:40.503 --> 39:42.551
Oh, Dicky. Tricky Dicky.

39:43.840 --> 39:46.309
They're never going to forget you.

39:47.969 --> 39:50.222
- Say hi to David Frost for me.
- David Frost?

39:54.183 --> 39:56.686
This person you want to marry.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.739
- Black?
- Yes...

40:00.398 --> 40:03.698
I know what people think of me,
but perhaps I'm a little more liberal...

40:03.776 --> 40:04.902
he is.

40:08.197 --> 40:12.703
I think the moon is far enough
for now, don't you, Mr Delaware?

40:12.785 --> 40:14.628
I figured it might be.

40:18.124 --> 40:21.799
- You could come with us.
- I escape often enough, thank you.

40:22.837 --> 40:25.340
And I have a promise to live up to.

40:27.383 --> 40:29.101
You'll understand soon enough.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.063
Okay, up to you.

40:33.181 --> 40:37.106
- See you next time. Call me.
- What, that's it?

40:37.143 --> 40:41.319
- What's the matter with you?
- Have I forgotten something?

40:42.607 --> 40:45.156
Oh, shut up.

41:00.208 --> 41:03.963
Right. Okay. Interesting.

41:05.838 --> 41:07.215
What's wrong?

41:07.298 --> 41:08.845
You're acting like
we've never done that before.

41:08.925 --> 41:10.302
We haven't.

41:12.512 --> 41:14.560
- We haven't?
- Oh, look at the time, must be off.

41:14.639 --> 41:18.109
Um, but it was very nice.
It was... It was good.

41:18.184 --> 41:20.607
It was unexpected.

41:24.232 --> 41:27.987
You know what they say,
there's a first time for everything.

41:31.572 --> 41:33.165
And a last time.

41:35.284 --> 41:37.082
Rory, I'm going to need
thermo couplings.

41:37.161 --> 41:40.381
- The green ones and the blue ones.
- Okay, hold on.

41:44.460 --> 41:46.303
- So.
- So.

41:46.379 --> 41:50.850
- You're okay?
- Fine. Head's a bit weird.

41:51.467 --> 41:54.346
There's lots of stuff
I can't quite remember.

42:00.893 --> 42:03.021
After-effect of the Silence.
Natural enough.

42:03.062 --> 42:06.862
That's not what I was asking.
You told me you were pregnant.

42:07.650 --> 42:09.243
- Yes.
- Why?

42:09.318 --> 42:13.448
Because I was. I mean, I...
I thought I was. Turns out I wasn't.

42:13.531 --> 42:16.751
- No. Why did you tell me?
- Because you're my friend.

42:18.411 --> 42:20.254
You're my best friend.

42:22.582 --> 42:24.505
Hmm. Did you tell Rory?

42:28.379 --> 42:29.380
No.

42:30.548 --> 42:32.221
Amy,
why tell me and not Rory?

42:32.300 --> 42:34.553
- Why do you think?
- I don't know.

42:35.470 --> 42:38.599
I traveled with you in this Tardis
for so long.

42:38.681 --> 42:40.149
All that time.

42:41.142 --> 42:44.567
If I was pregnant for some of it,
wouldn't it have had an effect?

42:44.645 --> 42:47.148
Because I don't want to tell Rory
his baby might have three heads

42:47.273 --> 42:49.696
or like a time head or something.

42:50.568 --> 42:52.991
- What's a time head?
- I don't know, but what if it had one?

42:53.071 --> 42:56.166
- A time head?
- Shut up, all right?

42:58.034 --> 42:59.661
Oi, stupid face!

43:03.498 --> 43:04.966
Uh, yeah?

43:07.460 --> 43:08.461
Hello.

43:08.544 --> 43:11.138
I'm taking that away from you if
you're going to listen in all the time.

43:11.214 --> 43:13.182
Okay, that's... That's a fair point.

43:13.299 --> 43:15.518
But you should've told me
that you thought you were pregnant.

43:16.594 --> 43:19.017
I'm a nurse, I'm good with pregnancy.

43:19.097 --> 43:21.600
Not, as it turns out, that good.

43:21.682 --> 43:24.105
- So can you stop being stupid?
- Er, no.

43:24.185 --> 43:26.438
Never. I'm never,
ever going to stop being stupid!

43:26.521 --> 43:30.401
So, this little girl,
it's all about her. Who was she?

43:31.567 --> 43:33.240
Or we could just go off
and have some adventures.

43:33.319 --> 43:36.744
Anyone in the mood for adventures?
'Cause I am. You only live once.

44:17.530 --> 44:18.873
Are you okay?

44:19.907 --> 44:22.035
Little girl...

44:22.118 --> 44:24.212
- Are you okay?
- It's all right.

44:25.538 --> 44:27.336
It's quite all right.

44:27.790 --> 44:32.136
I'm dying, but I can fix that.

44:33.129 --> 44:36.804
It's easy, really. See?

45:01.407 --> 45:02.408
Yo ho ho!

45:02.700 --> 45:04.919
Our sensors picked you up.
Ship in distress.

45:04.994 --> 45:07.543
It's dangerous here.
There is a monster aboard.

45:07.580 --> 45:09.002
She leaves a mark on men is skin.

45:09.081 --> 45:10.549
Hello, Doctor, what's happening to me?

45:10.625 --> 45:11.626
You're stowaways!

45:11.876 --> 45:14.049
Amy, what are you doing?

45:14.128 --> 45:15.721
Saving your life.
Okay with that, are you?

45:20.551 --> 45:23.395
There's a stroppy, homicidal mermaid
trying to kill all.

45:27.308 --> 45:28.309
She's here.
