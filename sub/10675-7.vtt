00:00.421 --> 00:02.833
♪♪

00:08.129 --> 00:09.800
Check it out, guys.

00:09.800 --> 00:12.183
Mr. Davenport shipped us
a box from Mission Creek.

00:12.183 --> 00:13.684
As long as he's
not in it, then yay!

00:15.476 --> 00:18.189
Cool. It's some of
our old technology.

00:18.189 --> 00:20.731
Hey, look, a Daven note.

00:21.942 --> 00:23.904
"Dear Elite Force,

00:23.904 --> 00:26.147
I'm converting the basement
into a nursery for the new baby,

00:26.147 --> 00:28.949
so please keep this stuff
in the penthouse for me."

00:28.949 --> 00:30.911
He's raising a baby
in the basement?

00:30.911 --> 00:33.074
That kid's gonna have
some serious issues.

00:36.367 --> 00:37.958
What's this?

00:37.958 --> 00:39.660
The cyber cloak.

00:39.660 --> 00:41.462
It's a virtual
body disguise.

00:41.462 --> 00:43.664
It can make you take on
anyone's appearance.

00:43.664 --> 00:45.876
One time, I got stuck
looking like Bree,

00:45.876 --> 00:47.338
and I had to go to
the school dance

00:47.338 --> 00:48.719
with this guy named Jake.

00:50.301 --> 00:52.723
Same thing
happened to me.

00:52.723 --> 00:54.345
Not the cyber cloak.

00:54.345 --> 00:55.976
Texting mishap.
Long story.

00:55.976 --> 00:57.938
I'll tell you
about it later.

00:57.938 --> 01:00.311
And then I'll tell you

01:00.311 --> 01:03.314
how I orchestrated
the whole thing.

01:03.314 --> 01:05.606
Ooh, what's this?

01:05.606 --> 01:07.898
Be careful.
That's a memory wipe.

01:07.898 --> 01:10.991
It can erase minutes,
hours, even years

01:10.991 --> 01:13.033
of someone's life.

01:13.033 --> 01:15.196
Hey, if I use this
on Skylar,

01:15.196 --> 01:16.907
maybe she'll forget
all the stupid things I've said

01:16.907 --> 01:18.749
and wanna date me.

01:18.749 --> 01:21.792
It's a memory wipe,
not a miracle maker.

01:24.335 --> 01:27.208
So how does
this thing...

01:27.208 --> 01:28.799
Oh, what's this?

02:15.886 --> 02:17.968
Okay,
team meeting time.

02:17.968 --> 02:21.021
Thank you all for coming.

02:21.021 --> 02:23.394
We live here.

02:23.394 --> 02:26.106
Did you really have to post
flyers in the kitchen?

02:26.106 --> 02:28.859
That was Oliver's idea.

02:28.859 --> 02:32.863
And I think the attendance
speaks for itself.

02:34.034 --> 02:36.907
Anyway, I have an update
about our plan

02:36.907 --> 02:39.450
to warn all the superheroes
about Roman and Riker.

02:39.450 --> 02:41.782
By using Kaz' computer
password from Mighty Med,

02:41.782 --> 02:43.994
we were able to access
the encrypted

02:43.994 --> 02:46.587
superhero communications
network.

02:46.587 --> 02:49.210
It's a secure way
for superheroes to
message each other

02:49.210 --> 02:51.001
without exposing themselves
to the outside world.

02:51.001 --> 02:53.634
It's also a great way
to share recipes.

02:53.634 --> 02:56.887
Red Assassin loved
my banana muffins.

02:58.849 --> 03:00.471
The network has gathered
the locations

03:00.471 --> 03:02.263
of all remaining superheroes.

03:02.263 --> 03:04.355
It took some time
since most of them

03:04.355 --> 03:06.897
use civilian cover identities
to live undetected.

03:06.897 --> 03:07.978
Oh!

03:07.978 --> 03:10.150
Which reminds me.

03:10.150 --> 03:12.523
I also have
a civilian cover now.

03:12.523 --> 03:16.116
Secretly, I'm Kaz,
a fire-powered superhero.

03:16.116 --> 03:18.949
But to the world,
I'm Match Head,

03:18.949 --> 03:22.583
a mild-mannered
regular Joe.

03:22.583 --> 03:26.036
So your civilian cover
has a superhero name?

03:26.036 --> 03:28.289
Superhero name?

03:28.289 --> 03:30.090
I know, like,
four Match Heads.

03:31.091 --> 03:33.754
Have a seat.

03:33.754 --> 03:35.886
My point is,

03:35.886 --> 03:37.798
now that the list is complete,

03:37.798 --> 03:39.340
we can warn
all the superheroes

03:39.340 --> 03:41.011
if Roman and Riker
are trying to hunt them down.

03:41.011 --> 03:42.973
Hey, Crossbow's on here.

03:42.973 --> 03:45.846
She taught me everything
I know about being a superhero.

03:45.846 --> 03:48.148
She was my first
real friend on Earth.

03:48.148 --> 03:51.732
Yeah, but I am your
first best friend, right?

03:51.732 --> 03:53.524
No. Not even close.

03:55.115 --> 03:58.068
Look, she's living undercover
right here in Centium City.

03:58.068 --> 04:00.160
I can't wait to see her.

04:00.160 --> 04:01.492
It's been years.

04:01.492 --> 04:03.073
Sorry, Skylar.

04:03.073 --> 04:04.955
No meeting up
with superheroes.

04:04.955 --> 04:06.457
We never know
who's watching.

04:06.457 --> 04:09.630
We can't take the chance
of exposing their true identity.

04:09.630 --> 04:11.542
But Crossbow's in danger.

04:11.542 --> 04:14.084
Every hero is in danger.

04:14.084 --> 04:17.087
That's why using the network
is the safest option.

04:17.087 --> 04:18.929
We can get the word out
to everybody at once,

04:18.929 --> 04:20.641
and confirm
when they receive it.

04:20.641 --> 04:24.595
Okay. I guess I won't
get to see my friend.

04:24.595 --> 04:26.977
But at least I still
have you, right, Bree?

04:26.977 --> 04:28.979
Not even close.

04:33.524 --> 04:36.317
I'm Bree.
Whoosh, whoosh.

04:36.317 --> 04:38.068
I'm Chase.

04:38.068 --> 04:40.030
Smart, smart.

04:40.030 --> 04:43.163
Kaz, what are you doing?
Put those down.

04:43.163 --> 04:44.665
Why? They're just dolls.

04:44.665 --> 04:47.207
Action figures!

04:47.207 --> 04:50.791
Chase, I've been on
that side of the argument.

04:50.791 --> 04:52.212
It is a losing battle.

04:52.212 --> 04:54.044
Let's just admit it;
we like dolls.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.298
Action figures!

05:00.551 --> 05:04.054
Hey, did Crossbow
get her message yet?

05:04.054 --> 05:06.016
Uh, no.

05:06.016 --> 05:07.848
But a lot of other
superheroes have.

05:07.848 --> 05:10.060
The system's working,
and it is all thanks

05:10.060 --> 05:13.193
to Match Head.

05:13.193 --> 05:16.316
All you did was
give Chase your password,

05:16.316 --> 05:18.939
which you only remembered
because you copied my password

05:18.939 --> 05:20.441
so you didn't have
to remember one.

05:20.441 --> 05:22.703
And it worked.

05:25.496 --> 05:27.908
Something's wrong.
She should've checked in by now.

05:27.908 --> 05:30.871
Don't worry, Skylar.
I'm sure Crossbow
will get her message soon.

05:30.871 --> 05:32.623
And what if she doesn't?

05:32.623 --> 05:34.084
She's here in Centium City.

05:34.084 --> 05:36.006
Roman and Riker could be
tracking her down

05:36.006 --> 05:37.167
just like they did
with us.

05:37.167 --> 05:39.880
Look, I've done the math,

05:39.880 --> 05:41.882
and this is the best way
to spread the word.

05:41.882 --> 05:44.845
There's a 98% chance that
the message will get to her.

05:44.845 --> 05:47.638
Which means there's
a two percent chance
that it won't.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.390
Hold on.

05:49.390 --> 05:51.892
Yeah, that's right.

05:59.900 --> 06:02.072
Hey, Skylar, just got
back from the gym.

06:02.072 --> 06:04.284
Great sesh.

06:04.284 --> 06:07.077
Blasted the old delts.

06:07.077 --> 06:10.160
Your delts
are up there.

06:10.160 --> 06:12.953
So you've noticed.

06:16.296 --> 06:19.299
Still worried
about Crossbow, huh?

06:19.299 --> 06:21.171
How could I not be?

06:21.171 --> 06:24.304
We lost so many superheroes
when Mighty Med was destroyed,

06:24.304 --> 06:27.808
but there was no way
of seeing that coming.

06:27.808 --> 06:30.270
If something happens now,

06:30.270 --> 06:32.973
and I know
I could've warned her,

06:32.973 --> 06:35.936
I'll never be able
to live with myself.

06:35.936 --> 06:38.939
I know.

06:38.939 --> 06:41.151
What if Crossbow
doesn't get that message,

06:41.151 --> 06:43.323
and Roman and Riker
get to her before we do?

06:43.323 --> 06:45.696
I don't know what to do.

06:48.909 --> 06:50.871
I do.

06:50.871 --> 06:52.793
You're gonna find
Crossbow.

06:52.793 --> 06:54.204
And I'm coming
with you.

06:54.204 --> 06:55.876
- Really?
- Yeah.

06:55.876 --> 06:58.298
We'll just get her location
off the superhero list.

06:58.298 --> 07:00.300
As long as we're
careful and quick about it,

07:00.300 --> 07:01.592
no one will even know.

07:01.592 --> 07:04.384
So it'll be
like our little secret.

07:04.384 --> 07:07.137
Yeah. I mean,
I've always thought

07:07.137 --> 07:09.600
we should have
little secrets.

07:12.222 --> 07:14.054
Are you flexing?

07:16.146 --> 07:18.058
Possibly.

07:24.324 --> 07:27.237
( birds cawing )

07:32.242 --> 07:34.334
I don't care
what you have to do.

07:34.334 --> 07:36.877
Just get
that superhero list.

07:36.877 --> 07:38.248
What are you gonna do?

07:38.248 --> 07:41.131
I'm gonna cross off
the first name.

07:47.387 --> 07:49.219
According to the list,

07:49.219 --> 07:51.351
Crossbow's civilian
cover name is Angela Conner,

07:51.351 --> 07:53.143
and she's
a groundskeeper.

07:53.143 --> 07:55.355
This park is huge.
There's no way we're
ever gonna find--

07:55.355 --> 07:56.807
Oh, there she is.

07:59.560 --> 08:02.563
- Skylar!
- Crossbow!

08:02.563 --> 08:06.276
Uh, no.
Never heard that name before.

08:06.276 --> 08:08.949
( robotic voice )
My name is Angela Conner,

08:08.949 --> 08:11.371
and I am
a groundskeeper here

08:11.371 --> 08:14.244
at the Centium City
Community Park.

08:16.076 --> 08:18.168
She's good.
That sounded real natural.

08:19.710 --> 08:21.582
It's okay.
He's with me.

08:21.582 --> 08:24.254
He's a superhero, too.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.886
Seriously?

08:25.886 --> 08:28.298
Are we just letting
anybody in?

08:44.695 --> 08:46.276
I was so worried
about you.

08:46.276 --> 08:49.449
I wasn't sure if you
made it out of Mighty Med alive,

08:49.449 --> 08:51.652
but judging by you sitting
here breathing and stuff,

08:51.652 --> 08:53.864
I guess you did.

08:53.864 --> 08:57.417
Yeah, and I have
another surprise for you.

08:57.417 --> 08:58.458
I got my powers back.

08:58.458 --> 09:00.460
Ah! How?

09:00.460 --> 09:02.122
Don't say it, don't
say it, don't say it.

09:02.122 --> 09:05.215
From this amazing bionic
guy named Chase.

09:05.215 --> 09:06.927
And she said it.

09:08.669 --> 09:10.380
Look, Crossbow,

09:10.380 --> 09:12.172
the people who destroyed
Mighty Med

09:12.172 --> 09:15.305
are in Centium City,
hunting down superheroes,

09:15.305 --> 09:16.306
including you.

09:16.306 --> 09:18.018
What?

09:18.018 --> 09:20.350
Their names are
Roman and Riker.

09:20.350 --> 09:22.562
They're shape shifters
who can fuse together

09:22.562 --> 09:24.895
to form an incredibly
powerful black swarm.

09:24.895 --> 09:26.897
So if you see them,
don't try to fight them alone.

09:28.148 --> 09:30.190
Come on, Skylar.

09:30.190 --> 09:32.282
We better get back before
Chase realizes we're gone.

09:33.493 --> 09:34.865
Take care of yourself.

09:34.865 --> 09:37.958
I'm so glad
I got to see you.

09:37.958 --> 09:39.660
We'll have to get together
when all this blows over.

09:39.660 --> 09:42.502
Definitely.
Thanks for the heads up.

09:45.295 --> 09:47.127
And thank you, Oliver.

09:47.127 --> 09:49.299
Oh, well, my pleasure.

09:52.132 --> 09:54.514
The pleasure's all mine.

09:54.514 --> 09:57.057
Come on. Seriously?

09:57.057 --> 09:58.679
We were having a moment.

10:08.528 --> 10:11.361
This is one of the guys
you just showed me, isn't it?

10:11.361 --> 10:13.493
Yep. This is...

10:13.493 --> 10:15.535
I wanna say Riker.

10:15.535 --> 10:17.788
Roman.

10:17.788 --> 10:20.791
Ah! So close.

10:21.912 --> 10:24.124
Nice work.

10:24.124 --> 10:26.546
You played right into
my hands.

10:26.546 --> 10:28.298
And as a thank-you,

10:28.298 --> 10:31.511
I'm gonna let you watch
your friend perish.

10:31.511 --> 10:33.633
I don't think so.

10:37.347 --> 10:39.349
Velcro. Smart.

10:39.349 --> 10:42.432
Stand down.

10:42.432 --> 10:44.104
He's mine.

10:45.936 --> 10:49.359
You know the worst thing
about being a groundskeeper?

10:49.359 --> 10:51.481
After I fill you with arrows,

10:51.481 --> 10:54.364
I'm gonna have to
clean up the mess.

10:56.947 --> 10:59.489
My turn.

11:03.413 --> 11:05.706
Crossbow!

11:07.167 --> 11:08.338
( coughing )

11:17.057 --> 11:19.389
Kaz, why are you on
the cyber desk?

11:19.389 --> 11:23.433
Or as you like to call it,
the shiny light-up table.

11:23.433 --> 11:26.566
Oh, um, I just wanted
to go over

11:26.566 --> 11:29.609
that superhero location list
one more time.

11:29.609 --> 11:34.234
- Why?
- To make sure
there's no typos.

11:34.234 --> 11:37.157
Uh, you're worried
about typos?

11:37.157 --> 11:39.910
The last time you texted me,
you misspelled LOL.

11:39.910 --> 11:42.532
Just pull up the list.

11:42.532 --> 11:45.245
All right.
Chill out.

11:45.245 --> 11:48.999
He's probably just cranky
'cause we took away his dolls.

11:48.999 --> 11:51.421
What does that even mean?

11:51.421 --> 11:53.543
Uh, the dolls?

11:53.543 --> 11:56.336
The ones you were just
playing with earlier?

11:56.336 --> 11:59.599
Oh. Right. Yeah.

11:59.599 --> 12:02.432
Those were, um,
very special to me.

12:04.014 --> 12:05.806
Now where's the list?

12:05.806 --> 12:09.689
Kaz, what did those dolls
look like?

12:09.689 --> 12:12.813
Um...

12:12.813 --> 12:14.815
Who are you?

12:18.318 --> 12:21.241
- Riker.
- I'm taking that list.

12:22.622 --> 12:24.494
The only question is,

12:24.494 --> 12:27.207
how much I have to hurt you
to get it.

12:30.630 --> 12:34.835
Right now, my brother's
retrieving your list
of superheroes,

12:34.835 --> 12:37.257
and taking out
the rest of your team.

12:37.257 --> 12:39.429
So congratulations.

12:39.429 --> 12:42.472
You're all failing
at the same time.

12:42.472 --> 12:44.514
You protect Crossbow.

12:44.514 --> 12:46.226
I'll take him out
with my super strength.

12:47.227 --> 12:48.768
You're going down.

12:48.768 --> 12:50.390
Da-da-da-da-da-da!

12:53.273 --> 12:55.816
"A" for effort.

12:58.819 --> 13:01.241
You're really
getting on my nerves.

13:20.590 --> 13:22.182
Say good-bye to
your bestie.

13:26.766 --> 13:29.890
- Roman, stop.
Don't do it.
- Why not?

13:29.890 --> 13:32.352
I've got the list, but they've
already sent out the alert.

13:32.352 --> 13:34.104
The other superheroes
know we're coming.

13:34.104 --> 13:35.695
Let's keep her alive so
we can use her as bait

13:35.695 --> 13:37.988
- to draw them to us.
- Good idea.

13:39.699 --> 13:42.322
Don't move!

13:43.573 --> 13:44.784
They must've followed me.

13:44.784 --> 13:47.447
They'll be sorry they did.

13:52.252 --> 13:53.753
Stand back.
They're making their swarm.

13:55.455 --> 13:57.167
It's not working.

13:57.167 --> 13:58.838
Probably because
I'm not Riker.

14:05.725 --> 14:08.468
You just got
cyber cloaked.

14:15.185 --> 14:18.068
That's right,
and I was Bree.

14:20.610 --> 14:22.652
- Why?
- I don't know.

14:22.652 --> 14:24.444
I just wanted
to use the cyber cloak.

14:26.947 --> 14:28.368
Where's my brother?

14:28.368 --> 14:29.619
In an industrial freezer

14:29.619 --> 14:32.542
so he can't
shape-shift his way out.

14:34.664 --> 14:36.416
Give it up, Roman.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.258
You've been outsmarted.

14:38.258 --> 14:40.300
Now you're
outnumbered.

14:48.768 --> 14:50.600
This is interesting.

14:50.600 --> 14:53.063
How about a trade?

14:53.063 --> 14:55.015
Crossbow for your brother.

14:55.015 --> 14:58.979
No. Crossbow
for my brother...

14:58.979 --> 15:00.320
and the list.

15:00.320 --> 15:02.822
That's not a fair trade.

15:02.822 --> 15:04.784
Yeah, 'cause up to
this point,

15:04.784 --> 15:07.407
he seemed like
such an honorable guy.

15:08.658 --> 15:10.200
Don't do it.

15:10.200 --> 15:11.992
That's my offer.

15:11.992 --> 15:14.454
You can take it,
or say good-bye

15:14.454 --> 15:16.997
to Crossbow forever.

15:16.997 --> 15:19.249
Stop!
We'll take the deal.

15:19.249 --> 15:21.751
Skylar, please don't.

15:21.751 --> 15:23.843
If Roman and Riker
get that list,

15:23.843 --> 15:25.505
they'll take out
every superhero on it.

15:25.505 --> 15:27.007
We'll find a way
to stop them.

15:27.007 --> 15:28.638
And what if
we can't?

15:28.638 --> 15:31.011
You're putting the life
of one hero over all the rest.

15:31.011 --> 15:33.313
I can't just
let her die.

15:33.313 --> 15:35.225
If she was your friend,
you'd take the deal.

15:37.517 --> 15:39.729
She's right.

15:39.729 --> 15:41.021
I'll get Riker
and the list.

15:43.693 --> 15:45.865
Good choice.

15:45.865 --> 15:47.487
Let Riker go.

15:49.659 --> 15:52.072
Now the list.

15:52.072 --> 15:53.743
Crossbow first.

15:53.743 --> 15:54.914
Same time.

15:54.914 --> 15:56.836
Don't do it!

15:56.836 --> 16:00.130
Skylar, you've done
all you could to protect me.

16:00.130 --> 16:04.004
Just... just keep
the other heroes safe.

16:04.004 --> 16:07.297
No. I'm not just
gonna let you die.

16:11.891 --> 16:13.853
This is it!

16:13.853 --> 16:16.476
Everything we need
to wipe out

16:16.476 --> 16:19.939
the rest of these
pathetic heroes.

16:19.939 --> 16:23.313
You keep this safe.

16:39.039 --> 16:41.671
No!!

16:41.671 --> 16:45.505
- ( screams )
- Crossbow!

16:49.759 --> 16:51.261
( gasping )

16:51.261 --> 16:55.305
Don't... let them win.

16:55.305 --> 16:57.937
( coughs )

16:57.937 --> 16:59.939
No.

17:04.814 --> 17:06.776
One superhero down.

17:06.776 --> 17:09.649
And now it's time
to exterminate the rest.

17:11.151 --> 17:13.743
List or no list.

17:34.134 --> 17:36.015
Forget this.
I'm out.

17:40.059 --> 17:43.443
Riker. Get back here,
you coward.

17:46.646 --> 17:49.739
This isn't over.

17:55.905 --> 17:58.037
Come on. We gotta
get her outta here.

18:11.921 --> 18:16.716
Crossbow sacrificed herself
so the others could live.

18:16.716 --> 18:18.718
That makes her a true hero.

18:18.718 --> 18:21.481
She's gone,

18:21.481 --> 18:24.644
and it's all my fault.

18:24.644 --> 18:26.726
Nobody blames you.

18:26.726 --> 18:28.608
Well, you should.

18:28.608 --> 18:30.690
I messed everything up.

18:30.690 --> 18:32.442
No.

18:32.442 --> 18:35.535
I'm the one who offered
to take you to Crossbow.

18:35.535 --> 18:37.997
I couldn't stand
to see you hurting.

18:37.997 --> 18:40.450
Thanks, Oliver.

18:40.450 --> 18:44.204
But I started this.

18:44.204 --> 18:47.457
And now,
I have to live with it.

18:47.457 --> 18:50.009
Wait a minute.

18:50.009 --> 18:53.923
Crossbow's gloves
are powered by
Horologian pearls, right?

18:53.923 --> 18:57.177
Just like the self-regeneration
paddles at Mighty Med.

18:57.177 --> 19:00.720
Exactly. So maybe we can
use the energy from

19:00.720 --> 19:03.263
Crossbow's gloves to repair
the damage to her body.

19:03.263 --> 19:04.934
We just need to direct
the energy into her body

19:04.934 --> 19:06.896
- instead of away from it.
- That's a great idea.

19:11.531 --> 19:13.363
Turn them inside out.

19:37.677 --> 19:38.968
( gasps sharply )

19:41.010 --> 19:42.512
I don't believe it.
It worked.

19:42.512 --> 19:43.683
Yes!

19:44.804 --> 19:47.477
So they brought her
back to life

19:47.477 --> 19:51.481
by turning her gloves
inside out.

19:51.481 --> 19:53.813
Superheroes.

19:53.813 --> 19:55.485
I give up.

20:04.784 --> 20:06.876
Good news.

20:06.876 --> 20:10.169
All of the superheroes have
received our encrypted message.

20:11.921 --> 20:14.674
The only bad news is
that Roman and Riker

20:14.674 --> 20:16.336
are still out there,

20:16.336 --> 20:18.338
and something tells me
they're not giving up.

20:29.269 --> 20:33.313
First you fail to procure
the list of superheroes.

20:35.655 --> 20:39.489
And then you fail to capture
even one member

20:39.489 --> 20:42.742
of this so-called
Elite Force.

20:42.742 --> 20:45.164
We'll get them.

20:45.164 --> 20:46.956
We just need more time.

20:46.956 --> 20:49.919
We don't have time!!

20:52.712 --> 20:55.134
It was my mistake

20:55.134 --> 20:57.877
to think that I could
count on you,

20:57.877 --> 21:00.720
my eldest son,
to make your father proud.

21:00.720 --> 21:02.261
Just tell us
what to do.

21:02.261 --> 21:05.184
You've done enough.

21:05.184 --> 21:08.808
It's time to switch
things up.

21:10.310 --> 21:13.022
This time,
the Elite Force

21:13.022 --> 21:15.605
won't know
what hit them.
