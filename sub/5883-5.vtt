WEBVTT

00:42.543 --> 00:46.796
l was expecting the Piersons as well,
but they're not coming. Please.

00:53.470 --> 00:56.889
My goodness. Of course. Here, take mine.

01:07.443 --> 01:10.153
l appreciate that both of you are here.

01:11.405 --> 01:12.405
What happened?

01:12.489 --> 01:15.408
The children were at the water fountain
during gym

01:15.492 --> 01:19.412
and Sally told Becky Pierson
she should save some for the fish,

01:19.663 --> 01:21.247
and Becky ignored her,

01:21.331 --> 01:25.334
and Sally hit the back of her head
and her face went into the spigot.

01:25.419 --> 01:29.839
And then Becky went after her...
Hair pulling, scratching.

01:32.342 --> 01:34.552
She didn't need stitches in the end,
l understand?

01:34.636 --> 01:39.390
This girl, this Becky Pierson,
Sally told me she's a bruiser.

01:39.850 --> 01:41.225
She's heavy.

01:42.853 --> 01:45.354
The children poke pencils into her sides
when she's sitting

01:45.439 --> 01:49.358
-because they think she can't feel it.
-Sally doesn't do that, does she?

01:49.443 --> 01:50.485
No.

01:51.320 --> 01:54.238
But this bad behavior is new.

01:55.115 --> 01:58.910
l know that you're expecting a child,
but she already has a little brother.

01:58.994 --> 02:03.122
l guess what l'm asking is,
has anything changed at home recently?

02:05.876 --> 02:12.256
My... My father passed away. Last week.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.679
The week before... Two weeks now.

02:22.142 --> 02:27.563
-l feel terrible for bringing that up for you.
-Well, it has not been easy.

02:31.318 --> 02:35.279
ls this Grandpa Gene we're talking about?
That poor thing.

02:36.490 --> 02:40.993
-Sally didn't mention it?
-Why didn't you call us or send a note?

02:42.830 --> 02:47.291
l don't think she missed a day.
Did she go to the funeral?

02:48.085 --> 02:52.964
-Why would we put her through that?
-l don't think children belong in graveyards.

02:55.342 --> 02:57.009
No, of course not.

02:58.387 --> 03:00.429
Now l realize why she was asking
all those questions

03:00.514 --> 03:03.099
-about Medgar Evers' murder.
-She was?

03:04.601 --> 03:05.935
l'm sorry.

03:06.687 --> 03:10.356
-l have to use the ladies room again.
-We can talk about this another time.

03:10.440 --> 03:13.651
No, l'm not as upset as l look.
l can't help this.

03:24.246 --> 03:26.873
-l am mortified.
-lt's not a good time.

03:27.624 --> 03:30.626
No, and it really should be, shouldn't it?

03:32.087 --> 03:35.840
Sally does need more attention.
She's grieving.

03:37.426 --> 03:41.554
There is a very special pain
to losing someone at that age.

03:44.141 --> 03:46.893
l don't know if you can understand that.

03:49.479 --> 03:50.688
l can.

03:58.113 --> 04:02.533
Mrs. Draper, l was just talking
to your husband and this really can wait.

04:03.493 --> 04:04.952
Are you sure?

04:06.455 --> 04:09.165
Because l just want to put it behind us.

04:09.750 --> 04:13.586
l really just want everything to be okay
when the baby comes.

04:13.921 --> 04:16.464
lt's going to be a beautiful summer.

04:22.554 --> 04:27.600
"Tipped a barman: 75 cents.
Hat-check tip at bar: 50 cents.

04:28.185 --> 04:31.354
"Cab to restaurant: $1 .1 2.
Tipped the cab driver: 38 cents.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.106
"Dinner at Hausner's: $1 9.44."

04:36.193 --> 04:39.695
lt's better to have a bit of Don Draper
than no Don Draper at all.

04:39.780 --> 04:41.781
l'd like that in writing.

04:43.116 --> 04:46.619
lt seems strange that the two of you
went on the same overnight trip

04:46.703 --> 04:50.706
and you put in for $70 and he put in for $82.

04:50.832 --> 04:53.793
lf l were lying,
wouldn't l have made it a round number?

04:53.877 --> 04:57.421
-Not that Don's lying.
-l signed his receipts, didn't l?

04:59.049 --> 05:02.885
Which brings us to the undocumented
portion of my assessment.

05:03.887 --> 05:08.391
The amount of pencils, pens, pads,
paper and postage

05:08.475 --> 05:12.728
that are currently being consumed
suit a company four times our size.

05:16.358 --> 05:20.778
lt has also been brought to my attention
that a credenza has disappeared,

05:21.571 --> 05:24.156
a theft that l believe
necessitates a conspiracy.

05:25.283 --> 05:28.119
People forget that Karl Marx
was the greatest economist who ever lived,

05:28.203 --> 05:31.163
and whatever you think of his solution,
the problem he posed

05:31.248 --> 05:33.916
was about the catastrophic
up-and-down of the marketplace.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.461
Tell the folks at Admiral
that Karl Marx says everything's okay.

05:37.546 --> 05:40.673
Boom and bust. Bull and bear.
"l need a TV." "l have a TV."

05:40.757 --> 05:43.175
Damn it, Paul,
someone helped Ken cherry-pick

05:43.260 --> 05:46.137
all of Burt's successful accounts
and l've been left with the dogs.

05:46.221 --> 05:49.849
-Admiral is not a dog.
-Sales are flat. lt's all over their memos.

05:49.933 --> 05:55.271
And now l have to look them in the eye
with nothing. Except maybe new creative.

05:56.773 --> 05:58.024
Stop it.

05:58.859 --> 06:04.321
Now you're interested. There are some
areas of growth, and l mean literally, areas.

06:04.406 --> 06:10.411
Atlanta, Oakland, Chicago,
Detroit, Newark, DC.

06:11.121 --> 06:12.163
Great jazz cities.

06:12.247 --> 06:15.708
And l left out St. Louis and Kansas City,
also growing.

06:17.377 --> 06:20.296
-What does that mean?
-Great jazz musicians?

06:20.380 --> 06:24.842
Seriously, is it possible that these Admirals
are being bought by negroes?

06:24.926 --> 06:27.553
Lois caught her scarf
putting paper in the Xerox.

06:27.637 --> 06:29.764
Maybe when Joan leaves
l can finally get rid of her.

06:29.848 --> 06:31.390
Can you pretend like you're back
in the media department

06:31.475 --> 06:34.769
and tell me what this says to you?
Look at the cities.

06:34.853 --> 06:37.730
ls it possible that negroes
are out-buying other people two-to-one?

06:37.814 --> 06:40.775
You could jump to that conclusion,
l suppose.

06:42.110 --> 06:45.362
Did you hear about Lois?
You got a winner there, Kinsey.

06:45.447 --> 06:47.281
-Did you see it?
-l did.

06:49.451 --> 06:53.120
So what's everybody doing tonight?
Baby. Married. Kinsey?

06:53.622 --> 06:57.166
Do you want to go to the Mets game?
Tickets and a watch.

06:57.709 --> 07:01.796
-Why, thank you, Birds Eye.
-Does the watch say "Birds Eye" on it?

07:02.005 --> 07:07.718
No, it says, "Hamilton Electric."
What time is it? What time isn't it?

07:10.180 --> 07:13.432
-Admiral is happy. We're happy.
-They're not happy!

07:14.184 --> 07:18.187
"Morris, comma, in reference
to retooling the factory

07:18.271 --> 07:21.357
"for London Fog children's
and young adults..."

07:23.443 --> 07:28.114
l thought l'd bring you the minutes
to the meeting, since you had to run off.

07:33.912 --> 07:35.246
You're wasting paper.

07:35.372 --> 07:38.833
l'd have to make 1 ,000 to keep up
with your department.

07:40.585 --> 07:42.753
They waste paper because
they throw out bad ideas.

07:42.838 --> 07:46.632
They waste paper because they use it
to sop up spilled drinks,

07:46.716 --> 07:48.592
right after their mid-afternoon naps.

07:48.677 --> 07:50.553
You came here because
we do this better than you,

07:50.637 --> 07:54.014
and part of that is letting our creatives
be unproductive until they are.

07:54.099 --> 07:57.226
Pennies make pounds
and pounds make profits.

07:57.727 --> 08:02.481
l don't want to talk to you this way.
l've tried it before and it never works.

08:03.733 --> 08:07.528
-You're not usually this emotional.
-You want to make money?

08:11.074 --> 08:14.994
Start getting your nails dirty
with Bert Cooper and Harry Crane.

08:15.662 --> 08:19.582
Clients love to pay for media
and creative needs pencils.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.376
l suppose l hadn't necessarily
thought of it that way.

08:22.460 --> 08:24.837
And lay off of expense accounts.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.840
Think of the men's morale,
not just your own.

08:28.175 --> 08:31.010
You've obviously seen
Bridge on the River Kwai.

08:31.094 --> 08:34.138
l've seen everything.
You have my ticket stubs.

08:46.943 --> 08:50.654
Your uncle Herman is on the line.
He won't leave a message.

08:51.948 --> 08:55.451
Uncle Herman?
My goodness, is Aunt Alice all right?

08:56.203 --> 09:00.247
-Who is this?
-lt's Peter. Dottie's boy. You called me.

09:00.457 --> 09:02.958
-lt's Duck. Duck Phillips.
-Duck.

09:03.418 --> 09:07.004
Sorry for the cloak and dagger.
l didn't want to set off any alarm bells.

09:07.088 --> 09:09.465
My name is Herman, you know that.

09:10.091 --> 09:12.760
Except that l actually have an Uncle Herman
and he's 91 .

09:12.844 --> 09:16.305
That's a sick joke. l apologize.
lt's been too long.

09:17.015 --> 09:18.682
l don't know if you heard,
but l'm at Grey now.

09:19.601 --> 09:21.227
What's that like?

09:21.394 --> 09:24.230
People walking around the halls
all the time, laughing their heads off?

09:25.982 --> 09:27.149
We're going to have lunch, you know.

09:27.567 --> 09:30.694
l don't know, Duck.
lt doesn't sound like a good idea.

09:30.904 --> 09:33.072
Campbell, this is beyond
"No hard feelings."

09:33.156 --> 09:36.492
l won't waste your time.
Haven't l always been on your side?

09:39.663 --> 09:41.956
-When?
-I'll have my girl call your girl.

09:42.290 --> 09:43.832
l'll say it's Clorox.

09:52.509 --> 09:56.553
Hello? Anyone home?

09:59.432 --> 10:01.558
l'll get it. Hello?

10:01.977 --> 10:03.769
-Mr. Draper?
-Yes.

10:04.187 --> 10:09.942
This is Suzanne Farrell, Sally's teacher.
l'm not interrupting dinner, am l?

10:11.528 --> 10:14.196
-No.
-l just felt l should call and apologize

10:14.281 --> 10:16.198
about our meeting this morning.

10:17.409 --> 10:18.534
Why?

10:22.539 --> 10:23.872
Well, l...

10:26.793 --> 10:30.963
What l mean is,
my father died when l was eight

10:31.548 --> 10:36.593
and l might have overdone it,
relating to Sally in that way.

10:37.512 --> 10:40.139
I didn't mean to upset your wife, and...

10:41.057 --> 10:45.436
l guess l can get a little caught up in things
and lose perspective.

10:50.775 --> 10:53.652
l don't know why l'm calling.
l'm embarrassing myself.

10:54.446 --> 10:56.071
No, you're fine.

10:58.658 --> 11:01.243
-lf there's anything l can do...
-Don?

11:02.078 --> 11:03.245
Betts!

11:05.290 --> 11:07.082
Thanks for the call.

11:11.254 --> 11:14.798
-lt's time to go.
-Okay, we're going. Let me get my keys.

11:15.759 --> 11:17.551
They're in your hand.

11:18.803 --> 11:22.097
Francine took the kids. Who was that?

11:22.932 --> 11:24.099
No one.

11:26.394 --> 11:29.063
lf you're parked in emergency,
you'll have to move soon.

11:29.147 --> 11:31.565
First, let's make sure it's not a false alarm.

11:31.649 --> 11:33.859
-This is my third time.
-We sent you home before?

11:33.943 --> 11:35.444
No, third baby.

11:39.991 --> 11:43.535
Yourjob's done.
The solarium's down the hall to the right.

11:43.620 --> 11:45.412
Hang in there, Betts.

11:59.260 --> 12:00.719
l came in early to cover for a friend,

12:00.804 --> 12:04.306
so there's a chance l'll see you
the whole way through.

12:07.227 --> 12:08.352
Daddy!

12:08.436 --> 12:11.063
You can scream and yell
as much as you want in this hallway,

12:11.147 --> 12:14.483
-but we're about to pass the nursery.
-Of course.

12:21.616 --> 12:22.950
Excuse me.

12:23.451 --> 12:26.078
l know it's silly, but l seem
to be having trouble with this pen.

12:26.162 --> 12:28.622
-l believe it's empty.
-l gotta go.

12:33.253 --> 12:36.088
Are you planning
to give the baby the breast?

12:36.172 --> 12:38.424
-No.
-Last time you ate?

12:40.343 --> 12:45.305
Lunch. Toast, cottage cheese, pineapple.

12:45.515 --> 12:49.351
Pineapple? What were you thinking?
Anything else, sweetheart?

12:50.979 --> 12:54.273
-Life Savers.
-Has your water broken?

12:54.858 --> 12:59.528
My water never breaks.
When will Dr. Aldridge be here?

13:05.869 --> 13:07.369
Joseph Waddell?

13:08.746 --> 13:11.748
-l'm Dennis Hobart.
-That's good to know.

13:12.375 --> 13:15.711
l haven't seen anybody in an hour.
What's going on?

13:16.171 --> 13:20.466
-Well, we've had a shift change.
-My wife, Pam, Pamela Hobart.

13:20.925 --> 13:24.303
She's fine. The baby's breech.
We're calling in a specialist.

13:24.387 --> 13:27.222
-What?
-Didn't somebody get your permission?

13:27.307 --> 13:29.975
Damn it, what is with you people?
l don't know a damn thing!

13:30.059 --> 13:32.102
Please don't raise your voice.

13:32.187 --> 13:35.022
Now, l apologize,
but we need your permission.

13:35.106 --> 13:39.276
-Do whatever you have to do.
-We'll update you religiously. Promise.

13:49.037 --> 13:52.915
This is not how l pictured it.
Where's all the backslapping?

13:54.417 --> 13:58.754
You know, l brought this because
l thought it'd be a party in here.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.217
-lt's not, but l'll have one.
-Right now?

14:03.301 --> 14:04.968
Whenever you want.

14:11.434 --> 14:14.603
l left work this morning.
l've been here all day.

14:15.813 --> 14:17.314
l am so bored.

14:20.527 --> 14:24.905
l even called in.
Like the prison can't run without me.

14:38.461 --> 14:41.713
-You done this before?
-Twice.

14:44.050 --> 14:48.804
-And yet l never thought to bring a bottle.
-Well, what are we supposed to do?

14:52.684 --> 14:56.979
My daughter took forever.
l remember being pretty worked up.

14:58.982 --> 15:01.275
And the nurse said, "Don't forget.

15:01.359 --> 15:04.486
"Your wife's in the boat.
You're on the shore."

15:06.531 --> 15:10.033
-The other one a boy?
-Yes.

15:13.162 --> 15:15.163
You throw the ball around?

15:17.166 --> 15:18.542
Not enough.

15:38.605 --> 15:41.398
All right, Mrs. Draper,
l'm going to need you to get on the bed

15:41.482 --> 15:45.235
so l can prepare you for delivery.
This part should be familiar.

15:45.320 --> 15:48.572
l'll shave you
and then give you a quick low enema.

16:00.168 --> 16:02.961
Well, the good news is, time has stopped.

16:03.838 --> 16:07.299
l'd like to have a gold watch one day,
but l can't, you know?

16:07.383 --> 16:09.217
You don't want
to have anything on you like that.

16:09.302 --> 16:11.178
Would they attack you?

16:12.680 --> 16:16.600
l knew it was just a matter of time
before you started with the questions.

16:16.684 --> 16:21.521
l bet you have a nightmare where you end
up in Sing Sing, right? Everybody does.

16:22.231 --> 16:24.816
-l do.
-So what's it like?

16:26.944 --> 16:30.447
You're outnumbered,
but you got the power.

16:30.573 --> 16:32.783
Kind of like being a king.

16:33.743 --> 16:37.621
-Except your subjects want to kill you.
-Maybe, but they don't,

16:37.914 --> 16:42.042
'cause they know l'm dangerous,
and l got a badge, which they respect.

16:42.126 --> 16:44.586
How do they know you're dangerous?

16:46.047 --> 16:49.257
Well, they're not all bad. There's extremes.

16:49.676 --> 16:52.386
We've got death row
and then we've got the baseball team.

16:52.470 --> 16:54.805
ln '29, they played the Yankees.

16:56.474 --> 16:58.266
Everybody in stripes.

17:01.521 --> 17:03.271
You're a funny one.

17:05.650 --> 17:09.945
l tell a lot ofjokes at work.
You hear some doozies.

17:12.240 --> 17:17.119
l have to watch what l do when l leave work,
be careful not to bring it home.

17:17.620 --> 17:19.788
Especially with a kid, right?

17:23.042 --> 17:25.335
Just yesterday l was in A block

17:25.878 --> 17:29.089
and l thought,
"Every single one of these animals,

17:29.507 --> 17:32.342
"their mother had them, they were a baby."

17:32.802 --> 17:36.596
And l think, "There they are,
on the other side of the fence."

17:36.681 --> 17:41.309
And you know what? Every one of them
would blame their mom and dad.

17:42.562 --> 17:45.480
-That's a bullshit excuse.
-That's true, Don.

17:54.490 --> 17:58.493
You have little veins.
Breathe and think about the beauty parlor.

18:02.457 --> 18:05.500
-Do you need to call someone else in?
-lt's in.

18:05.960 --> 18:10.297
The medication will help with the pain
and put you in a twilight sleep.

18:10.631 --> 18:13.425
-Where is Dr. Aldridge?
-He's in the city.

18:13.801 --> 18:17.304
He went to Mama Leone's
for his anniversary. lsn't that sweet?

18:17.388 --> 18:18.930
ls he drinking?

18:19.265 --> 18:21.224
'Cause my Aunt Emma,
her doctor was drunk,

18:21.309 --> 18:22.809
and he ruined her bladder.

18:22.894 --> 18:26.813
Dr. Mendelowitz, the obstetrician,
is on duty and will fill in.

18:27.690 --> 18:30.817
-l don't want him. l don't know him.
-He's our top man.

18:30.902 --> 18:32.402
l want Dr. Aldridge.

18:32.487 --> 18:34.988
You have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

18:35.072 --> 18:37.532
l don't want another doctor.
l want my doctor.

18:37.617 --> 18:40.285
Sit back. You're at 5 centimeters.

18:40.912 --> 18:43.914
That's halfway from here to the Hebrides
and other mountain ranges,

18:43.998 --> 18:46.917
which we are currently studying
in chapter 1 2.

18:47.001 --> 18:49.419
The doctor will be here and there.

18:51.923 --> 18:53.924
The Hebrides are islands.

19:43.349 --> 19:44.724
Try it now.

19:48.312 --> 19:49.980
Thank you, Sister.

19:52.024 --> 19:54.442
What do you make her for? Sixteen?

20:11.794 --> 20:14.296
Pam was screaming at me in the car.

20:15.423 --> 20:18.967
-l don't think that's unusual.
-That's my girl in there.

20:22.805 --> 20:24.931
lf something happens to her,

20:26.851 --> 20:29.060
l just don't know what l'd do.

20:29.145 --> 20:32.772
And then there'd be that baby.
How could l love that baby?

20:42.533 --> 20:45.243
Our worst fears lie in anticipation.

20:47.413 --> 20:49.456
You're so sure about that?

20:52.460 --> 20:55.545
-l want to go home, you bitch!
-Please relax!

20:56.130 --> 21:00.675
Let go of me! Get your hands off me!
Where's Don?

21:00.760 --> 21:03.303
-He's in the waiting room.
-No, she can't hear you.

21:03.387 --> 21:08.600
The hell l can't. Where is he? Where's Don?

21:08.684 --> 21:11.227
-He's in the waiting room.
-Bullshit.

21:11.646 --> 21:14.272
He's never where you expect him to be.

21:14.357 --> 21:17.817
Have you seen him?
Have you been with him?

21:18.361 --> 21:20.445
Seven centimeters. She's starting transition.

21:20.529 --> 21:24.199
Someone call him. l don't want to be here.

21:25.201 --> 21:27.535
Push the Demerol, 25 milligrams.

21:32.541 --> 21:36.628
l'm just a housewife.
Why are you doing this to me?

21:46.389 --> 21:51.267
Mr. Hobart? Congratulations.
You have a little baby boy.

21:53.062 --> 21:56.564
-Oh, my God.
-Your wife and your baby are doing fine.

21:56.857 --> 21:58.650
Can l go in? Can l see her?

21:58.734 --> 22:01.319
Not right now. She lost a lot of blood
and had a transfusion.

22:01.404 --> 22:06.366
-What? Please, l have to see her.
-Please, she's in recovery, resting.

22:06.993 --> 22:10.912
But you can go to the nursery and look in
at your son. lt's just down the hall.

22:10.997 --> 22:12.330
Thank you.

22:18.587 --> 22:20.547
A baby boy.

22:24.593 --> 22:27.303
-Congratulations.
-You're all right, Don.

22:30.516 --> 22:33.101
l'm sure yours is gonna be good, too.

22:35.896 --> 22:39.399
You know what? l know it.

22:41.736 --> 22:43.278
Thanks, Dennis.

22:47.742 --> 22:51.494
You're an honest guy.
Believe me. l'm an expert.

22:54.081 --> 22:55.707
Go see your baby.

22:56.042 --> 22:59.669
Why do they put up with us?
You know, we don't deserve it.

23:03.424 --> 23:07.469
This is a fresh start.
l don't know who's up there,

23:09.472 --> 23:13.308
so l'm saying this to you.
l'm gonna be better.

23:15.311 --> 23:17.312
l'm gonna be a better man.

23:20.316 --> 23:22.150
Tell me you heard me.

23:27.114 --> 23:28.490
l heard you.

23:41.670 --> 23:44.130
Don't fight the urge to bear down.

23:44.840 --> 23:50.970
l can't. l can't. l can't do it.

23:51.806 --> 23:56.017
Either you can do it or we will,
but it's going to come out some way.

24:34.056 --> 24:35.223
Daddy?

24:36.559 --> 24:38.434
-Who are you?
-lt's me.

24:41.480 --> 24:43.106
l don't know you.

24:44.108 --> 24:45.859
lt's me, Elizabeth.

24:51.365 --> 24:52.907
You do know me.

24:55.703 --> 24:58.580
-Okay, so it's me.
-What are you doing here?

24:59.456 --> 25:02.375
-l had to go away.
-Well, don't you miss me?

25:03.085 --> 25:06.087
Of course. Listen.

25:08.132 --> 25:10.300
Nobody knows l'm here, okay?

25:16.515 --> 25:17.891
Am l dying?

25:18.809 --> 25:21.769
Ask your mother. Tell her, Ruthie.

25:23.397 --> 25:26.858
Elizabeth, shut your mouth.
You'll catch flies.

25:33.949 --> 25:37.410
l left my lunch pail on the bus
and l'm having a baby.

25:39.580 --> 25:42.457
You see what happens to people
who speak up?

25:45.085 --> 25:47.212
Be happy with what you have.

25:48.255 --> 25:51.090
You'll be okay. You're a house cat.

25:51.175 --> 25:54.302
You're very important
and you have little to do.

26:37.471 --> 26:40.515
-She's beautiful.
-lt's a boy.

26:45.020 --> 26:46.688
You look terrible.

26:54.405 --> 26:58.324
-How do you feel?
-l need to put my face on.

26:59.868 --> 27:01.869
You look beautiful, Betts.

27:03.914 --> 27:07.166
-Gene.
-What did you say?

27:10.546 --> 27:12.297
His name is Eugene.

27:14.383 --> 27:16.759
We don't have to decide that now.

27:18.929 --> 27:20.054
Gene.

27:33.861 --> 27:35.611
Did you get any sleep?

27:35.696 --> 27:38.906
No, and l don't expect to
for the next six months.

27:44.163 --> 27:46.581
l wasn't sure where to put it all.

27:50.627 --> 27:55.673
Mr. Draper's office. Please hold.
lt's Mr. Sterling. Are you in?

28:02.681 --> 28:05.099
-Roger.
-Dada.

28:06.685 --> 28:08.936
-Where are you?
-Down the hall.

28:09.772 --> 28:11.272
How's Betty? She perform like a champ?

28:12.107 --> 28:14.192
-She did.
-I need his initials.

28:14.610 --> 28:17.528
Jane's gonna put them on the back
of her yacht or something for him.

28:17.821 --> 28:19.030
No name yet.

28:19.448 --> 28:21.449
There's a lot of guys
twiddling their thumbs down in art.

28:22.451 --> 28:25.536
-Why were you in the art department?
-Lane was.

28:25.662 --> 28:28.623
Apparently, we're all backed up. No one
will move forward without your approval.

28:29.124 --> 28:31.834
-l missed half a day.
-Well, Betty had the baby, not you.

28:33.128 --> 28:35.380
-l'll see what l can do.
-Good.

28:35.756 --> 28:38.966
That guy's a tick.
See you at the traffic meeting.

28:44.515 --> 28:46.391
Can l get some coffee?

28:49.144 --> 28:53.189
You know what it's like in that office.
No one ever buys me lunch.

28:54.525 --> 28:56.818
-l like the turtleneck.
-Really?

29:06.245 --> 29:08.955
-Come. Join us.
-What is she doing here?

29:09.123 --> 29:10.748
Don't worry about it. l know what l'm doing.

29:10.833 --> 29:13.000
-No, you don't.
-Have a nosh.

29:14.753 --> 29:18.047
Two months at Grey
and you're already having a nosh?

29:25.597 --> 29:27.890
l didn't know until l got here.

29:29.560 --> 29:33.020
Look, l woke up one day
and had a realization.

29:34.022 --> 29:39.277
-You two have a secret relationship.
-What? That's ridiculous.

29:39.528 --> 29:41.946
Come on. The way you handled
that Freddy Rumsen thing

29:42.030 --> 29:43.781
so that she could move up?

29:43.866 --> 29:47.201
l've been doing this a long time.
l know what l saw.

29:47.661 --> 29:50.621
-That's not what happened.
-You can be modest if you want to,

29:50.706 --> 29:54.250
but that kind of focused ambition
is rare in advertising.

29:54.543 --> 29:55.877
Thank you.

29:57.379 --> 30:00.214
l want to take you both with me
to the promised land.

30:00.299 --> 30:03.509
At Grey,
an account man is expected to have ideas,

30:03.635 --> 30:05.803
and creatives are expected to be geniuses.

30:05.888 --> 30:09.974
You'll be sitting on velvet pillows,
showered with riches, awards.

30:10.225 --> 30:14.729
-We're not going anywhere. Well, she can.
-Do we have to go together?

30:18.734 --> 30:22.069
Pete, l know you have ideas
and you're a risk-taker.

30:22.321 --> 30:24.322
Sterling Cooper
is never going to reward that.

30:26.992 --> 30:30.369
Well, thank you. Anything else?

30:30.621 --> 30:33.873
Don't be a baby. You should be taking
meetings like this twice a week.

30:33.957 --> 30:37.585
lf you want to woo me,
you'll have to buy me my own lunch.

30:41.131 --> 30:44.425
-Maybe l should leave, too.
-Why would you do that?

30:45.427 --> 30:49.180
You're so talented.
You should strike while the iron's hot.

30:49.598 --> 30:52.433
-What does that mean?
-lt means the sky's the limit.

30:52.518 --> 30:54.310
No mortgage, no family.

30:54.394 --> 30:58.231
You're a freewheeling career gal
with great ideas. Am l wrong?

31:00.234 --> 31:03.653
-l don't know.
-This is your time, Peggy.

31:25.842 --> 31:29.679
Let me ask you something, Hollis.
What type of TV do you have?

31:30.222 --> 31:32.014
-An RCA.
-Really?

31:33.308 --> 31:36.435
Color? Why did you get it?

31:37.354 --> 31:40.940
-To watch TV.
-But why an RCA specifically?

31:42.693 --> 31:45.319
l didn't see any difference, l guess.

31:46.530 --> 31:49.532
Sixteen. Good afternoon, gentlemen.

31:53.787 --> 31:57.415
A lot of negroes prefer Admiral.
l've done research.

31:58.208 --> 31:59.709
l have an RCA.

32:01.086 --> 32:05.423
-So, do your friends buy Admirals?
-l'm sorry, sir. l can't really say.

32:13.599 --> 32:18.644
Look. This is important and l'd really like
to have an honest conversation with you.

32:19.062 --> 32:20.646
l don't want to get into trouble.

32:20.731 --> 32:24.108
-lt's just us. lt's just Hollis and...
-Mr. Campbell.

32:26.987 --> 32:28.988
Do you think l'm a bigot?

32:30.073 --> 32:32.908
l just want to know
why you bought your TV.

32:35.454 --> 32:39.915
-l don't know. l don't remember.
-lt's your TV. lt's a big purchase.

32:40.542 --> 32:43.919
-l don't even watch the damn thing.
-Really? Why not?

32:44.129 --> 32:48.591
Why should l? We've got bigger problems
to worry about than TV, okay?

32:50.302 --> 32:52.845
You're thinking about this
in a very narrow way.

32:52.929 --> 32:56.390
The idea is that everyone is going
to have a house, a car, a television...

32:56.516 --> 32:58.225
The American dream.

33:08.403 --> 33:11.739
-lt's my job.
-Every job has its ups and downs.

33:15.243 --> 33:18.245
You don't watch baseball?
l don't believe you.

33:53.782 --> 33:57.118
-What are you doing out of bed?
-l smelled something.

33:57.911 --> 34:01.163
-What are you making?
-A snack. You want some?

34:02.958 --> 34:06.877
-l didn't know you could cook.
-Mommy's much better at it.

34:11.258 --> 34:13.759
-Are you looking for a chick?
-l am.

34:16.930 --> 34:20.474
Miss Farrell told us about that
when we went to the farm.

34:21.810 --> 34:24.895
But she says those eggs
can never become a chicken,

34:24.980 --> 34:28.733
-even though they come out of a chicken.
-Why's that?

34:29.317 --> 34:31.610
Because they're from the store.

34:32.738 --> 34:36.532
And you know what else?
lf you hold an egg up and it has veins in it,

34:36.616 --> 34:39.660
-you can shake it, then eat it.
-Really?

34:40.829 --> 34:42.580
lt's called addling.

34:47.544 --> 34:50.546
ls the baby gonna live
in Grandpa Gene's room?

34:55.844 --> 34:59.096
lt's not Grandpa Gene's room.
lt's the baby's room.

35:04.770 --> 35:09.356
-l thought it was gonna be a girl.
-Well, l thought you were gonna be a boy.

35:13.028 --> 35:15.070
Not all surprises are bad.

35:23.079 --> 35:26.832
-Everything's gonna be fine.
-That's what Miss Farrell said.

35:27.584 --> 35:30.127
Well, then l guess it must be true.

35:54.236 --> 35:59.698
Burt Peterson's firing was undignified.
Building security. That's all l'll say.

36:00.534 --> 36:04.578
Confirm a couple of rumors.
Did he throw a desk chair against a window

36:04.663 --> 36:07.456
only to have it bounce back
and knock him over?

36:07.541 --> 36:08.541
Not that l know of.

36:08.625 --> 36:11.585
Did he make a number two in a file cabinet?

36:12.796 --> 36:18.717
Burt Peterson lived hard and loved hard.
So, Harry here is an expert in media.

36:19.010 --> 36:24.640
-Television. The air, not the sets.
-Now, Admiral Television sales are flat.

36:24.891 --> 36:27.268
-We know that.
-But as we studied your indices,

36:27.352 --> 36:29.979
we realized that they're not flat everywhere.

36:30.063 --> 36:34.191
ln fact, among negroes,
sales are actually growing.

36:34.568 --> 36:37.236
-We know that, too.
-You do?

36:41.116 --> 36:42.950
No, of course you do.

36:44.369 --> 36:49.039
These are your numbers, but l think
we've discovered an interesting strategy.

36:50.584 --> 36:52.334
This is Ebony.

36:54.296 --> 36:56.463
By negroes, for negroes.

36:57.465 --> 37:03.554
Jet. Space in these magazines costs far less
than what you currently spend.

37:05.640 --> 37:09.977
Daily newspapers that go just to this market
for pennies on the dollar.

37:10.478 --> 37:11.562
And?

37:18.612 --> 37:22.239
Shift a portion of the media budget
from lower-indexing white areas

37:22.324 --> 37:24.116
to this market, where it can do more good.

37:24.200 --> 37:27.453
They already like it and we can make them
buy more by increasing the exposure.

37:27.537 --> 37:29.872
A 5% sales bump in Detroit alone

37:30.040 --> 37:33.792
would make you the same profit
as a 2% increase system-wide.

37:34.085 --> 37:37.046
And ads on television geared to this market
and white markets

37:37.130 --> 37:40.674
-will have double the effect.
-A negro ad and a white ad?

37:41.468 --> 37:45.137
So, Campbell,
you're making twice the ads for us now.

37:45.305 --> 37:48.515
No, do them together. lntegrate it.

37:49.059 --> 37:52.686
-l don't think that's legal.
-Of course it's legal.

37:53.855 --> 37:56.815
Look, this conversation is not worth having.

37:57.567 --> 38:00.694
Who's to say that negroes
aren't buying Admiral televisions

38:00.779 --> 38:03.572
because they think
white people want them?

38:09.537 --> 38:13.374
-Miss Olson is here to see you.
-Send her in.

38:17.712 --> 38:18.879
Sorry.

38:22.092 --> 38:25.427
l know he doesn't need clothes,
but don't return it.

38:25.512 --> 38:28.430
l'm the youngest. l never had anything new.

38:28.723 --> 38:31.225
-You didn't have to do that.
-l did.

38:31.351 --> 38:34.728
No one told me
they were all going in on it together.

38:37.524 --> 38:40.859
l heard you were back at work,
but now l wonder if that's true.

38:40.944 --> 38:42.569
l invited you in.

38:44.239 --> 38:48.867
l don't know if this is the best time.
l don't know. lt's kind of serious.

38:57.252 --> 39:00.129
l've been thinking about my situation here,

39:00.296 --> 39:03.382
and l'm so grateful to you
for all you've done.

39:04.634 --> 39:05.926
l just...

39:07.595 --> 39:10.514
Well, you know, l'm paid very little.

39:12.100 --> 39:16.729
My secretary doesn't respect me because
l make $71 more a week than she does.

39:16.813 --> 39:19.773
Maybe we need to get you
a cheaper secretary.

39:20.442 --> 39:24.653
Paul Kinsey does the same work that l do,
and not as well sometimes.

39:25.780 --> 39:28.866
And l don't know if you read it in the paper,
but they passed a law

39:28.950 --> 39:32.953
where women who do the same work
as men will get paid the same thing.

39:33.038 --> 39:34.371
Equal pay.

39:36.291 --> 39:37.875
lt's not a good time.

39:37.959 --> 39:42.212
lt's not a good time for me, Don.
Do you know how expensive this city is?

39:42.297 --> 39:47.092
lt's not gonna happen, Peggy, not now.
l'm fighting for paperclips around here.

39:58.938 --> 40:02.483
Third time. lt must be old hat.

40:17.832 --> 40:21.376
-You're gonna be fine, Peggy.
-l look at you and l think,

40:23.630 --> 40:26.840
-"l want what he has."
-Really?

40:29.844 --> 40:34.848
You have everything, and so much of it.

40:39.938 --> 40:42.231
l suppose that's probably true.

40:52.700 --> 40:54.827
What do you want me to say?

40:59.415 --> 41:02.376
l don't think l could have been any clearer.

41:04.003 --> 41:07.422
You see what's been going on here
the last six months?

41:19.727 --> 41:21.728
What if this is my time?

41:43.418 --> 41:44.459
Hey.

41:46.629 --> 41:50.591
-Where are you going?
-To the ladies room. You want to join me?

41:51.384 --> 41:53.802
-Did you tell Don about Duck?
-That's none of your business.

41:53.887 --> 41:57.639
Sure, they hear you're shopping around,
they'll want you more, but me?

41:57.724 --> 42:00.559
l'm sharing my job with Kenny.
l'm already redundant.

42:00.643 --> 42:02.811
You have relationships with your clients.
That's leverage.

42:02.896 --> 42:05.856
-Did you say something?
-lt's my decision, Pete.

42:05.940 --> 42:07.941
Your decisions affect me.

42:29.214 --> 42:33.342
lf it isn't Martin Luther King.
l should dropkick you off the roof.

42:33.885 --> 42:39.056
Admiral Television has no interest
in becoming a colored television company.

42:39.432 --> 42:42.184
But they are. lt seems illogical to me

42:42.268 --> 42:45.812
that they would reject an opportunity
to make more money.

42:46.940 --> 42:48.232
Then again, l'm in advertising.

42:48.316 --> 42:51.735
This is a sensitive issue.
Businesses hate that.

42:51.903 --> 42:53.654
Let me put it in account terms.

42:53.738 --> 42:57.032
Are you aware of the number of hand jobs
l'm gonna have to give?

42:57.116 --> 42:58.450
Am l being taken off the account?

42:58.534 --> 43:00.744
l'm going to have to pretend
l had you killed!

43:00.828 --> 43:02.537
Sales are flat. l had to do something.

43:02.622 --> 43:04.498
l don't know if anyone's ever told you
that half the time

43:04.582 --> 43:08.001
this business comes down to,
"l don't like that guy."

43:10.380 --> 43:12.631
Are we done with the flogging?

43:14.592 --> 43:17.386
Never as good as you think it's gonna be.

43:18.388 --> 43:20.764
lf l may. Bert, Roger,

43:21.808 --> 43:25.978
it does seem as though there's money
to be made in the negro market.

43:26.145 --> 43:28.230
Obviously not with Admiral,

43:28.356 --> 43:32.526
but l don't think it would be wrong of us
to pursue it in some way.

43:32.902 --> 43:34.111
Really?

43:35.113 --> 43:39.366
l've just moved here.
l'm a stranger in a strange land,

43:40.660 --> 43:44.204
but l can tell you
there's definitely something going on.

43:45.790 --> 43:49.293
We'll look into it. You can go.

44:41.262 --> 44:42.679
-We're here!
-She's here!

44:42.764 --> 44:44.890
-Mommy! Daddy!
-Mommy! Mommy!

44:45.016 --> 44:46.641
Welcome, welcome!

44:48.144 --> 44:49.311
Mommy!

44:49.645 --> 44:51.980
-Careful.
-Here, let me take him.

44:57.070 --> 44:58.862
l missed you so much.

45:00.615 --> 45:02.824
Wait till you see your fridge.

45:03.368 --> 45:07.621
lf there's a power outage,
you can feed the entire street for a month.

45:10.083 --> 45:14.336
-Hi, baby. l'm your brother, Bobby.
-Remember, you have to be careful.

45:15.421 --> 45:16.797
How was it?

45:17.465 --> 45:21.009
You know. lt was all a fog.

45:22.845 --> 45:26.056
You're making a mistake
not forcing Carla to stay.

45:26.474 --> 45:29.684
She's been away from her family.
And l can manage.

45:30.228 --> 45:33.480
-l know some girls.
-You want something to eat?

45:34.482 --> 45:36.691
-Sure.
-l got it. Come on.
