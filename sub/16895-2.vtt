I know I should be more like Lenore
and not care, but I just can't let it go.

26:03.812 --> 26:05.855
Some bank has gone belly up.

26:06.023 --> 26:09.734
I don't know. I just make sure all the words
are spelled correctly when it does.

26:09.902 --> 26:12.820
Anyway, don't worry about the wallet.
How was it?

26:12.988 --> 26:15.573
Don't worry? She has my identity, Tanya.

26:15.741 --> 26:19.494
- She could post my name on the Internet.
- Paranoia will destroy you, Ray.

26:19.662 --> 26:21.621
Lenore does not want your wallet.

26:21.789 --> 26:24.832
We don't know what she wants.
You barely even know this woman.

26:25.000 --> 26:27.627
I'm sure it's just
a weird misunderstanding.

26:27.795 --> 26:29.837
I will get your wallet back.

26:30.005 --> 26:33.591
Now, will you let it go
and tell me how it was?

26:34.510 --> 26:36.302
- It was okay.
- Okay?

26:36.971 --> 26:38.763
Can you use more adjectives?

26:38.931 --> 26:40.890
Fine, it was exhausting, irritating...

26:41.058 --> 26:44.560
...emasculating, never-ending
and vaguely pleasant.

26:44.728 --> 26:47.647
Vaguely pleasant? So it was good?

26:48.941 --> 26:51.776
If you get my wallet back, it was good.

26:51.944 --> 26:54.195
It worked? Oh, my God.

26:54.363 --> 26:57.532
Congratulations, Happiness Consultant.
Oh, my God.

26:57.700 --> 26:58.783
Should we go celebrate?

26:58.951 --> 27:01.828
I'm about to go teach first period, Tanya.

27:01.996 --> 27:05.540
Yeah, I know, I know. I'm kidding.

27:06.083 --> 27:08.126
Oh, my God, I hate this job.

27:08.294 --> 27:10.378
Let's make $1 million, Ray.

27:11.922 --> 27:14.757
Yeah, sure. I'm game.

27:24.143 --> 27:25.184
Okay.
