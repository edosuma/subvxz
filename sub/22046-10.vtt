You made it okay?
- Oh, yeah. Just--

26:47.505 --> 26:48.873
- both: Traffic.
- Was a little heavy.

26:48.940 --> 26:50.475

26:50.542 --> 26:52.877
And you two, you're from?

26:52.944 --> 26:55.280
both: Florida.
- Florida. Okay.

26:55.347 --> 26:58.416
It would just be really cool
to hear from each of you

26:58.483 --> 27:00.919
{\an8}kind of just what would be
your hope moving forward?

27:00.986 --> 27:03.188
{\an8}What would you like
to get from today?

27:03.254 --> 27:07.025
- I think our biggest
downfall was communication.

27:07.092 --> 27:09.194
{\an3}And it usually takes I think
about three hours

27:09.260 --> 27:11.796
we'll be together,
and then something will happen.

27:11.863 --> 27:13.131
Something so stupid,

27:13.198 --> 27:15.934
but it gets blown up way
more than it should be.

27:16.001 --> 27:19.104
- Yeah, and so I'm curious.
Can one of you tell me kind of

27:19.170 --> 27:22.140
what's life been like
growing up, the two of you?

27:22.207 --> 27:23.742
- We both have completely
different perceptions

27:23.808 --> 27:25.176
of our childhood.

27:25.243 --> 27:27.412
My father spoke illy
of my mother all the time.

27:29.047 --> 27:31.182
{\an7}...when I was around nine.
She was eight.

27:31.249 --> 27:33.752
It was definitely long.
Dragged out. It's crazy.

27:33.818 --> 27:36.054
I was, like, actually thinking
of ways that our parents would,

27:36.121 --> 27:38.823
{\an1}like, help us solve
our problems and stuff.

27:38.890 --> 27:40.592
And when we'd get in fights,
like,

27:40.658 --> 27:42.293
mom and dad would never
talk about anything.

27:42.360 --> 27:43.962
Nothing would be solved.
- Uh-huh.

27:44.029 --> 27:45.230
{\an1}- They literally would be like,
"Just hug it out."

27:45.296 --> 27:46.231
- It sounds like there
was conflict,

27:46.297 --> 27:48.066
but nobody was talking about it.

27:48.133 --> 27:49.434
Like, you were hugging it out.

27:49.501 --> 27:50.869
- They don't talk
about any problems.

27:50.935 --> 27:52.504
- She gets flustered
really easily.

27:52.570 --> 27:54.205
- Okay.
- And she'll just be like,

27:54.272 --> 27:55.707
"Oh, you're a stupid bitch.
Da-da-da,"

27:55.774 --> 27:59.144
and it makes me feel like
I'm, like, garbage.

27:59.210 --> 28:01.146
{\an3}- That is ridiculous.
Maybe, like, that one time

28:01.212 --> 28:03.848

like, that hotel room.

living in, Anna?

28:05.650 --> 28:06.985
See. She won't own up to it,
because she's embarrassed,

28:07.052 --> 28:07.986
and so she has
to point a finger.

28:08.053 --> 28:09.387
Hello? Like I just said.

28:09.454 --> 28:10.588
- I know I literally--if
I was an attacker--do

28:10.655 --> 28:11.956
you want me to say I attack you?

28:12.023 --> 28:13.425
I attack you.
Nothing is ever good enough.

28:13.491 --> 28:18.163
- That's the same way
I feel about you, Anna.

28:18.229 --> 28:19.564
- I just want her to tell me

28:19.631 --> 28:23.635

and not be so closed off.

28:23.701 --> 28:25.737
