00:55.089 --> 00:58.457
Maybe next time, bring back
some horses. Save my back, huh?

00:58.459 --> 01:00.526
Yeah, I don't think they'd
deal with the journey.

01:01.295 --> 01:02.694
Then I guess you're
stuck with me then.

01:02.696 --> 01:03.629
I guess so.

01:05.366 --> 01:07.666
- Aylmer!
- Lani, beautiful as ever.

01:07.668 --> 01:10.069
- Thank you.
- Great to see you.

01:10.704 --> 01:11.670
All good, boss?

01:11.672 --> 01:13.739
We're good, those
are for Kalima.

01:14.475 --> 01:17.643
- Oh, my knight in shining armor.
- M'lady.

01:19.680 --> 01:21.346
- I'll make some tea.
- That sounds good.

01:21.348 --> 01:23.649
- Did you manage to find me any--
- I did.

01:24.552 --> 01:26.185
You know, for someone
who loves the quiet life,

01:26.187 --> 01:29.288
you are obsessed with
modern convenience.

01:30.191 --> 01:31.123
Here you go.

01:31.559 --> 01:33.225
Ingenuity through struggle.

01:39.200 --> 01:41.200
Hey, makin' something cool?

01:41.202 --> 01:43.469
I don't know,
underwater flashlight.

01:43.704 --> 01:45.704
- What do you think?
- Yo!

01:48.609 --> 01:49.842
Hi, can I
get one of those?

01:49.844 --> 01:51.210
- Yeah, sure.
- Thank you.

01:57.551 --> 01:58.484
Ladies.

01:59.186 --> 02:00.185
A question.

02:00.187 --> 02:02.788
Well, it's a request
more than a question.

02:02.790 --> 02:04.156
Spit it out then.

02:04.725 --> 02:05.657
How can we help?

02:06.227 --> 02:07.693
I am looking for a linen,

02:07.695 --> 02:09.428
you know, spare linen
for my bait.

02:09.562 --> 02:12.131
- Your bait getting cold?
- No, it's getting loose.

02:12.133 --> 02:15.701
- You know, I've had an idea to--
- Absolutely not. With linen?

02:16.537 --> 02:17.436
No.

02:17.905 --> 02:19.671
Uh-- Leave it with us.

02:19.673 --> 02:21.607
We'll see if we have
anything that will work.

02:22.576 --> 02:23.609
Thanks.

02:23.611 --> 02:26.812
- A few additions.-
- Okay, let's have a look.

02:30.518 --> 02:31.483
Anything else?

02:32.453 --> 02:33.519
All right, leave with me.

02:34.421 --> 02:35.621
- I'll see you in a week.
- Mahalo.

02:48.569 --> 02:49.535
Who knows it?

02:51.672 --> 02:52.671
Only you two?

02:56.310 --> 02:57.643
Once she gets at it.

03:24.438 --> 03:25.504
- Good?
- Mm-hmm.

03:25.506 --> 03:26.939
Ah, so good, thank you.

03:38.519 --> 03:39.451
Ah!

03:54.268 --> 03:55.801
What do you say, we skip dinner?

03:56.704 --> 03:58.770
I say that by the time
dinner rolls around--

03:58.772 --> 04:00.872
You, you did this.

04:00.874 --> 04:03.675
- Uh, what, me, me, what, what'd I do?
- You should've been there!

04:03.677 --> 04:05.277
I shouldn't have been
doing it alone.

04:05.613 --> 04:06.878
Okay, well I'm sorry you got--

04:07.781 --> 04:09.581
You've been shirking
your responsibilities

04:09.583 --> 04:11.783
and sneaking off with her.
It's unacceptable!

04:11.986 --> 04:13.752
- Just let her help you then.
- I don't need her help.

04:13.754 --> 04:14.920
Okay then,
let's go back to the farm

04:14.922 --> 04:16.654
and discuss this like men, yeah?

04:18.892 --> 04:20.791
There's no need to talk,
this is your fault.

04:20.793 --> 04:22.527
Okay, it's my fault, you happy?

04:22.529 --> 04:24.963
What's going on?
Hey, what happened to your arm?

04:24.965 --> 04:26.865
- This <i>alaho</i> did this to me.
- Hey, what--

04:26.867 --> 04:29.401
- Enough with the name-calling.
- What, you did this to him?

04:29.403 --> 04:30.402
No, he did it to himself.

04:32.740 --> 04:34.306
Hey, you watch
what you say about my girl.

04:35.442 --> 04:36.608
- Hey!
- Haku!

04:37.044 --> 04:38.343
What are you--

04:38.345 --> 04:39.578
Uh, no, I, I'm sorry.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.980
I, I, I know, I'm sorry.

04:41.982 --> 04:43.715
Okay, I didn't mean
for that to happen.

04:43.717 --> 04:45.517
- I didn't, I didn't mean for that.
- No!

04:45.519 --> 04:46.718
- Hawila, stop.
- No!

04:46.920 --> 04:48.553
- Get off of him!
- Stop!

04:52.493 --> 04:53.425
Haku.

04:56.363 --> 04:57.296
Enough!

05:03.003 --> 05:03.935
And well?

05:05.806 --> 05:06.738
Well, what?

05:08.542 --> 05:10.042
What have you got to
say for yourself?

05:11.945 --> 05:13.578
I told you I was sorry.

05:14.481 --> 05:16.315
And you shouldn't have
said that about Lani.

05:17.718 --> 05:18.917
That's not an apology.

05:19.720 --> 05:20.919
Well, neither is that.

05:23.390 --> 05:24.389
You know who I am?

05:25.526 --> 05:28.093
Who my father is,
who my grandfather was?

05:29.596 --> 05:31.997
Fifty years ago, he would
have been hanged for this,

05:32.800 --> 05:34.433
banished at least.

05:34.435 --> 05:35.734
Everyone appreciates

05:35.736 --> 05:37.602
what your family
has done for the islands.

05:38.505 --> 05:40.839
But that was then, this is now.

05:41.742 --> 05:45.410
Yes, well in Aylmer's absence,
we are all your subjects.

05:45.412 --> 05:47.779
You are to take care
of us as best you can.

05:48.882 --> 05:51.683
No one will be
killed or banished

05:51.685 --> 05:53.385
for a simple misunderstanding.

05:53.387 --> 05:55.687
Simple misunderstanding?
He struck me!

05:56.623 --> 05:58.056
How do you expect me
to work with him again?

05:58.058 --> 05:58.990
I don't.

05:58.992 --> 06:02.661
You'll work with me,
fishing detail.

06:04.465 --> 06:07.432
- Hey, I'm, I'm not a fisherman.
- Not yet.

06:12.940 --> 06:14.072
Apologize to Lani.

06:19.880 --> 06:20.812
That's it?

06:24.017 --> 06:25.083
He shirks on me,

06:25.986 --> 06:27.652
he shirks on the whole village.

06:28.122 --> 06:29.588
That's the end of it.

06:31.992 --> 06:34.526
Sunrise. Don't be late.

07:06.026 --> 07:07.893
- What?
- Nothing.

07:09.430 --> 07:10.629
Oh, it's something.

07:10.864 --> 07:12.063
I know you're not
the best dancer,

07:12.065 --> 07:13.832
but you were never this bad.

07:14.768 --> 07:17.602
What's going on
in that head of yours?

07:20.908 --> 07:21.907
He thinks I'm weak.

07:22.176 --> 07:23.608
Don't mind Hawila.

07:24.611 --> 07:25.610
He will fare.

07:27.114 --> 07:30.715
But Haku did hit him,
and people are angry.

07:31.051 --> 07:32.484
You're the island protector:

07:36.490 --> 07:37.823
Because John Reaney died.

07:38.759 --> 07:41.026
Because you are
a man of integrity.

07:43.130 --> 07:46.198
I'm a hunter, I'm not a leader.

07:47.868 --> 07:50.869
Leader isn't someone who uses
others to make him strong, Ben.

07:52.940 --> 07:55.841
It's someone willing to give
their strengths to others.

07:58.679 --> 07:59.711
Sounds simple.

08:00.948 --> 08:04.850
Aylmer believes in you,
I believe in you.

08:06.086 --> 08:10.989
The people of Niihau believe
in you and your decisions.

08:27.107 --> 08:29.741
I think this thing is stupid,
it's not even working.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.844
A poor workman blames
his tools, man.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.279
Aw, yeah, yeah, it's
easy for you to say,

08:34.280 --> 08:35.212
you're the guy who never--

08:40.754 --> 08:41.820
What is that?

09:01.942 --> 09:03.308
Wait, Ben, wait!

09:08.982 --> 09:10.115
- Ben!
- Haku, no.

09:10.117 --> 09:11.116
- Ben!
- Hey, Haku, don't!

09:31.138 --> 09:32.604
Let's go, let's go!

09:51.024 --> 09:53.325
- With me. Grab the gear.
- Got it.

10:02.069 --> 10:03.034
Lani, clear the table!

10:06.373 --> 10:09.040
- What happened?
- His plane crashed!

10:09.042 --> 10:10.141
- Water.
- Okay.

10:10.677 --> 10:11.810
Yeah, Ben saved him!

10:11.812 --> 10:12.911
He's not saved yet.

10:13.614 --> 10:14.746
What can we do?

10:14.748 --> 10:16.281
Just go outside, wait,

10:16.283 --> 10:18.216
and give us room. Go, go.

10:45.312 --> 10:46.378
You can come in now.

10:57.924 --> 10:59.391
He looks in bad shape.

11:00.661 --> 11:02.293
Well, he looks worse than he is.

11:03.964 --> 11:07.098
Water inhalations,
his ribs may be broken,

11:07.668 --> 11:10.869
sprained shoulder,
a few cuts on his head and face,

11:10.871 --> 11:12.070
but nothing that won't mend.

11:13.373 --> 11:14.305
Can he talk?

11:15.442 --> 11:17.375
I've given him something
for the pain, but...

11:22.716 --> 11:24.215
Do you know where you are?

11:26.820 --> 11:28.386
You are on Niihau.

11:37.464 --> 11:41.199
Okay, so he can talk.
We just can't understand him.

11:42.169 --> 11:43.101
It's great.

11:44.404 --> 11:45.737
Where's Yoshio?

11:50.711 --> 11:52.343
- Ben needs you!
- What happened?

11:52.345 --> 11:54.279
- Ben needs you!
- Is Ben okay?

11:54.281 --> 11:56.781
- Haku, wait!
- We need you to translate.

11:56.783 --> 12:00.185
- Translate? Translate what?
- Not what, it's who.

12:05.859 --> 12:07.125
Someone order a translator?

13:08.121 --> 13:09.954
No, no, you need to rest.

13:19.533 --> 13:21.132
What was found on his person?

13:22.402 --> 13:24.803
A book in his jacket.

13:27.207 --> 13:28.773
- No papers?
- No.

13:28.774 --> 13:30.340
- Where's his plane now?
- At the bottom of the Pacific.

14:48.121 --> 14:50.154
Well, what happened?

14:51.591 --> 14:52.523
Yoshio?

14:56.963 --> 14:58.563
It was engine failure.

15:05.972 --> 15:07.305
So, what
do we do with him?

15:08.608 --> 15:10.408
Same thing
we'd do for any visitor.

15:11.544 --> 15:14.078
Tell him to rest,
he's in good hands.

15:40.273 --> 15:41.272
What's going on?

15:42.075 --> 15:43.241
I'm getting some extra.

15:43.243 --> 15:45.076
You know what I'm talking about.

15:47.113 --> 15:52.183
I heard what he said,
what he actually said.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.687
What did you want me to do?

16:02.729 --> 16:04.028
You need to tell Ben.

16:05.231 --> 16:08.032
I know, and I will.

16:09.469 --> 16:13.371
Just don't say
anything until I do.

16:25.585 --> 16:27.118
It's been a long day.

16:28.521 --> 16:29.454
It has.

16:32.559 --> 16:33.725
You did a good thing.

16:35.261 --> 16:36.427
I did what anyone else would do.

16:36.429 --> 16:38.696
I am not so sure about that.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.432
People help when they can.

16:42.369 --> 16:43.301
If they can.

16:44.137 --> 16:45.103
How they can.

24:23.863 --> 24:25.763
I didn't mean to disturb you.

24:35.608 --> 24:39.643
You don't have to be afraid
of us. We'll take care of you.

24:46.519 --> 24:48.953
My husband, Ben, he saved you.

24:51.858 --> 24:52.823
You have someone?

24:54.126 --> 24:55.192
Back home?

24:59.232 --> 25:02.233
When you are better,
we will get you back to them.

25:04.537 --> 25:05.269
I promise.

25:09.108 --> 25:14.778
For now, what say we get
you back to Kalima, yes?

25:17.683 --> 25:18.616
Are you okay?

25:19.252 --> 25:20.784
I'm fine. Just tea.

25:21.721 --> 25:22.720
Let me see your hand.

25:22.722 --> 25:24.221
I need to clean this up.

25:24.223 --> 25:25.923
Yoshio, it's just tea.

25:25.925 --> 25:26.891
Show me your hand.

25:30.029 --> 25:31.128
Yoshio.

25:33.232 --> 25:34.932
I need to tell you something.

25:37.670 --> 25:38.802
I don't know how.

25:39.639 --> 25:41.705
Whatever it is you can tell me.

25:43.843 --> 25:44.775
The pilot.

25:47.713 --> 25:49.396
What about him?

25:49.397 --> 25:51.080
He didn't crash,
he was shot down.

25:51.918 --> 25:52.850
By whom?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.319
By Americans.

25:56.689 --> 25:57.821
I don't understand.

25:58.925 --> 26:02.626
Japan and America are at war.

26:07.600 --> 26:11.068
No one else knows,
no one but Matsu.

26:12.605 --> 26:14.038
He heard me mistranslate.

26:21.681 --> 26:22.580
Say something.

26:22.582 --> 26:26.216
I know I shouldn't have lied,
but I did-- I need talk to him.

26:26.752 --> 26:27.685
What?

26:27.687 --> 26:30.988
We should tell Ben,
he'll know what to do.

26:31.290 --> 26:33.691
Look what happened
with Haku and Hawila,

26:34.126 --> 26:35.826
Ben couldn't control that.

26:38.331 --> 26:41.665
Talk to Matsu and explain
that we need time.

26:44.170 --> 26:45.669
Let me talk with the pilot.

26:51.944 --> 26:55.779
Shigenori,
his name is Shigenori.

27:09.829 --> 27:10.761
Matsu.

27:12.331 --> 27:15.099
I hope you're here to tell
me you've spoken with Ben.

27:15.101 --> 27:19.269
We don't know how he'll
react, how anyone will.

27:20.206 --> 27:23.107
This is someone's son,
Matsu, someone's grandson.

27:24.310 --> 27:25.643
What if it were you?

27:35.254 --> 27:39.657
I'm not asking for much,
just time, patience.

27:47.133 --> 27:48.198
Where are you going?

27:53.139 --> 27:55.439
I don't want anything
to do with this, Yoshio.

28:16.028 --> 28:17.194
Early morning swim?

28:17.897 --> 28:18.962
Something like that.

28:19.465 --> 28:20.431
That's a first.

28:20.833 --> 28:21.899
It's not a habit.

28:29.341 --> 28:31.475
Hey, come on in.

28:33.312 --> 28:34.311
You can set that there.

28:35.214 --> 28:36.146
How is he?

28:38.284 --> 28:39.950
He doesn't really say much.

28:41.921 --> 28:44.421
I'm going to change his bandages
soon if you wanna help.

28:45.925 --> 28:47.257
Can you please pass me my kit?

30:10.109 --> 30:12.376
- Is he okay?
- Yeah, he's fine.

31:53.412 --> 31:55.279
How's it coming?

31:56.081 --> 31:57.014
Matsu?

31:57.616 --> 31:58.916
He's a genius.

32:01.020 --> 32:02.653
Fresh batch.

32:22.541 --> 32:23.573
He's a young man.

32:27.947 --> 32:32.382
He's alone in a strange
place and he's afraid,

32:33.519 --> 32:34.718
more than most.

32:35.220 --> 32:36.954
You know how that feels.

32:39.191 --> 32:40.257
Just talk with him.

32:42.194 --> 32:43.593
It'll make sure he's okay.

33:14.727 --> 33:15.625
How is he?

33:16.395 --> 33:17.594
Physically, he's improving.

33:18.530 --> 33:20.097
It'll take some time but--

33:20.099 --> 33:21.098
Can he walk?

33:21.100 --> 33:24.368
His shoulder's a bit tender
and his ribs are bruised,

33:24.370 --> 33:26.670
but he should be okay.

33:27.473 --> 33:29.339
We're hoping to move
him out of here today.

33:31.377 --> 33:32.309
Come with me.

34:33.138 --> 34:34.071
We hunt.

35:51.250 --> 35:52.182
Why?

35:54.786 --> 35:56.353
Why did you save me?

35:59.758 --> 36:01.358
Tradition, these things.

36:03.529 --> 36:04.661
I should have died.

36:09.801 --> 36:13.203
When I found myself here,
I didn't know anyone.

36:14.339 --> 36:17.807
I didn't have anyone,
but I was taken in,

36:18.844 --> 36:22.879
given food, shelter, family.

36:25.617 --> 36:28.285
So, I guess my tradition
dictates that I should help.

36:37.563 --> 36:38.795
Tradition is a funny thing.

36:45.771 --> 36:47.804
I was trained to be a warrior...

36:49.541 --> 36:50.473
once.

36:51.877 --> 36:54.344
All I ever wanted was peace.

36:58.350 --> 36:59.282
Peace.

37:03.422 --> 37:04.487
Family.

37:08.560 --> 37:09.759
What do you want now.

37:13.732 --> 37:14.831
To go home.

37:20.005 --> 37:21.838
I just want to go home.

37:40.859 --> 37:42.692
I tried to speak with Matsu.

37:45.764 --> 37:49.833
He's not happy, but I don't
think he'll say anything.

37:52.504 --> 37:53.837
We need to think of a plan,

37:55.274 --> 37:57.540
but at least we have
some time to decide.

37:57.542 --> 37:58.608
No, we don't.

38:02.047 --> 38:03.613
There's a beacon on his plane

38:04.716 --> 38:06.516
and submarine out there
waiting for him.

38:06.885 --> 38:08.818
But, but how could they
know he's--

38:08.820 --> 38:10.887
Because they told
him to land here.

38:13.392 --> 38:15.025
We're their contingency.

38:18.330 --> 38:23.400
Yoshio, if he hit the beacon,
the Japanese know he's here.

38:25.003 --> 38:26.536
And if they come for him,

38:27.039 --> 38:29.572
they'll slaughter everyone
on the island.

38:50.395 --> 38:53.563
Wow, impressive.

38:59.604 --> 39:02.906
And Niihau is yours, my friends.

39:04.042 --> 39:06.509
Ooh.

39:11.750 --> 39:14.651
He should take it easy
does not mean go hunting.

39:20.625 --> 39:22.025
Well, I hope it was worth it.

39:29.735 --> 39:30.667
Done.

39:33.538 --> 39:34.471
Can I show him?

39:49.621 --> 39:50.653
I hope you like it.

39:58.630 --> 39:59.763
Is that a yes?

40:00.799 --> 40:01.731
Yes.

40:04.069 --> 40:05.135
Yeah.

40:05.137 --> 40:06.870
He could stay on the island.

40:16.815 --> 40:17.747
Have a word?

40:17.749 --> 40:19.783
- Is this about Haku?
- It's not.

40:23.622 --> 40:26.089
- In private?
- There's no one on this island

40:26.091 --> 40:28.091
more qualified to deal
with a problem than my wife.

40:30.695 --> 40:31.761
This pilot,

40:33.432 --> 40:34.531
we need to be careful.

40:35.066 --> 40:36.132
He could be a spy.

40:37.569 --> 40:39.736
I know that your sheep-rearing
techniques

40:39.738 --> 40:41.438
have been productive, Hawila,

40:41.440 --> 40:43.573
but I'm not sure
word has spread to Japan.

40:44.443 --> 40:45.742
This isn't funny.

40:45.744 --> 40:46.676
I agree.

40:47.746 --> 40:49.012
Then what's your plan here.

40:49.014 --> 40:52.048
When Aylmer arrives,
we take him to the big island,

40:52.050 --> 40:53.583
maybe get him home.

40:53.585 --> 40:55.552
- But we don't even know--
- I wasn't asking.

40:57.556 --> 41:00.723
- This is our land and we need to protect--
- He's here now,

41:01.493 --> 41:03.893
and he'll be treated
for what he is, a guest.

41:12.704 --> 41:15.605
No way. Absolutely not.

41:15.607 --> 41:17.774
You're the best swimmer
on the island.

41:18.143 --> 41:20.109
- There is no one else to ask.
- I told you,

41:20.111 --> 41:21.678
I don't wanna be
involved in this.

41:21.680 --> 41:23.913
- You are Japanese.
- Exactly.

41:23.915 --> 41:26.783
You're a Nisei born
in Hawaii, and I'm Japanese,

41:26.785 --> 41:29.886
and that's exactly why I don't
wanna be involved in this

41:29.888 --> 41:31.721
'cause I can't risk
my life here.

41:31.723 --> 41:35.191
If that beacon is on
and the Japanese turn up,

41:35.961 --> 41:37.694
what do you think
is going to happen?

41:37.696 --> 41:39.996
They're aren't gonna
grab Shigenori and leave.

41:42.767 --> 41:45.235
This is the only way
no one gets hurt, Matsu.

41:47.706 --> 41:52.976
If we don't, it'll be worse,
much worse for everyone.

41:55.814 --> 41:57.046
Including you.

42:09.828 --> 42:10.994
What do you want me to do?

42:13.532 --> 42:15.632
Once we confirm
the Japanese aren't coming

42:16.067 --> 42:19.869
and the island is safe,
we'll get him on a boat.

42:20.071 --> 42:22.238
Then we can put
this whole thing behind us.

42:31.983 --> 42:33.116
Here, my friends.

43:14.292 --> 43:16.726
Ella tells me you went
out with Shigenori today.

43:26.037 --> 43:27.203
He spoke to me.

43:28.273 --> 43:29.639
He spoke to you?

43:30.709 --> 43:31.641
In English.

43:33.244 --> 43:34.611
You never said that.

43:35.213 --> 43:36.145
What did he say?

43:36.915 --> 43:37.847
Not much.

43:39.150 --> 43:40.183
He's a good hunter.

43:42.988 --> 43:44.921
He'll start with me
fishing detail, tomorrow.

43:45.757 --> 43:46.689
Earn his keep.

44:22.060 --> 44:22.992
That's nice.

44:24.996 --> 44:25.928
Did you make it?

44:29.100 --> 44:30.066
A friend?

44:34.172 --> 44:37.407
Cheer up, I'm sure
you'll see him soon.

44:43.348 --> 44:44.280
No.

44:50.188 --> 44:53.256
I watched him die.

45:06.171 --> 45:07.437
What did you find out?

45:08.873 --> 45:10.406
It's a simple distress beacon.

45:12.377 --> 45:13.743
I know how it works.

45:14.379 --> 45:15.745
It wasn't flashing.

45:15.947 --> 45:17.480
It wasn't emitting
any information.

45:18.817 --> 45:21.217
- Then they don't know he's here.
- And they aren't coming.

45:22.287 --> 45:25.088
- Do we tell him?
- No, let him think they are.

45:25.090 --> 45:26.889
It buys us time to get
him off the island.

45:26.891 --> 45:28.758
He won't leave
without his papers.

45:28.760 --> 45:31.027
His papers, they weren't there.

45:31.496 --> 45:33.396
- Then where are they?
- I don't know.

45:33.865 --> 45:35.198
It could've fallen out
on impact.

45:35.200 --> 45:37.066
It could be at the bottom
of the ocean or--

45:38.870 --> 45:39.969
Or?

45:41.506 --> 45:45.274
Hawila, I think he may
have gone down there.

45:45.477 --> 45:47.343
Could he have made that swim?

45:47.879 --> 45:51.147
- In daylight, yes.
- Okay then, if Hawila has them,

45:51.149 --> 45:53.149
- we need to get them back.
- There is no we.

45:54.119 --> 45:57.887
The beacon has not been triggered.
The island is safe. I'm done!

45:58.857 --> 46:00.022
What about Hawila?

46:01.893 --> 46:02.959
Matsu!

46:02.961 --> 46:04.193
What about Hawila?

46:22.347 --> 46:23.813
You spoke of tradition.

46:25.116 --> 46:27.216
Here on Niihau,
everyone contributes

46:27.218 --> 46:28.417
to each other's materials.

46:28.419 --> 46:32.889
Of each catch, each kill,
everyone plays a part.

46:34.459 --> 46:36.425
Lures are passed down
through generations.

46:43.234 --> 46:45.568
This was given to me
by the man who raised me,

46:48.039 --> 46:49.539
the man who made me
who I am today.

46:51.476 --> 46:52.842
I want you to have it.

47:26.511 --> 47:27.410
What?

47:30.148 --> 47:31.214
Pitiful.

47:33.351 --> 47:36.219
Oh, all right, well thanks
for the support, guys.

47:36.221 --> 47:37.854
I've only been at
this for two days.

47:39.524 --> 47:40.323
Ha!

47:40.324 --> 47:41.123
It's your technique.

47:41.960 --> 47:47.230
I watch, your style,
very poor, very bad.

47:48.366 --> 47:51.167
Okay, okay, very poor, very bad.
Okay, I get it.

47:53.037 --> 47:54.203
Think you can do better.

48:35.580 --> 48:36.512
Thank you.

48:49.360 --> 48:52.128
A friend gave me this.

48:55.333 --> 48:56.265
Now I...

48:59.003 --> 49:00.569
give it to a friend.

49:42.613 --> 49:44.380
You went to the crash site.

49:45.984 --> 49:47.483
I know you have his papers.

49:52.490 --> 49:53.990
I need them back.

49:53.991 --> 49:55.491
- You need them?
- I have a little over $40 here,

49:56.327 --> 49:57.760
42 to be exact.

49:59.097 --> 50:02.031
It's all yours for the papers.

50:04.202 --> 50:05.134
No.

50:05.136 --> 50:09.038
- Don't you get it? I don't have any--
- I don't want money.

50:10.008 --> 50:11.340
Then what do you want?

50:11.609 --> 50:13.275
I wanna know why he's here.

50:18.483 --> 50:20.282
And I want you
to get off my farm.

50:21.786 --> 50:24.653
There will be trouble
if the papers aren't returned.

50:27.592 --> 50:29.091
I said, get off my farm.

50:47.111 --> 50:50.813
He won't sell them,
but he has them, he has them!

50:50.815 --> 50:52.815
He said that. He didn't have to.

50:53.451 --> 50:56.752
Aylmer arrives
tomorrow, tomorrow.

50:56.754 --> 50:59.555
Then we've run out
of time, I'm sorry.

51:00.391 --> 51:02.124
There's nothing else we can do.

51:03.394 --> 51:04.693
Maybe you can talk to him

51:04.695 --> 51:06.562
before anybody else
gets a chance,

51:06.564 --> 51:09.231
- make him see sense, tell him that--
- Are you in?

51:10.435 --> 51:12.101
He'll listen to you.

51:12.570 --> 51:14.403
Convince him to take Shigenori

51:14.405 --> 51:16.372
back with him
to the authorities.

51:17.742 --> 51:19.341
We just need him off the island.

51:19.343 --> 51:21.110
And how do you know
that's any better

51:21.112 --> 51:24.814
than staying here
for him or for us?

51:27.251 --> 51:28.350
I don't.

51:43.868 --> 51:45.835
Why are you so important?

52:22.673 --> 52:23.606
It's late.

52:25.610 --> 52:26.642
I swam to the plane.

52:27.812 --> 52:28.878
Hawila.

52:36.854 --> 52:38.320
What am I looking at?

52:38.656 --> 52:39.622
I don't know.

52:39.624 --> 52:40.689
They make no sense to me.

52:41.492 --> 52:42.691
Found them in the cockpit.

52:46.264 --> 52:47.396
I also found this.

52:52.870 --> 52:54.837
Yoshio offered me money
for these tonight.

52:55.573 --> 52:57.206
- Why would he do that?
- I don't know,

52:58.476 --> 53:00.342
but I'm telling you,
something isn't right.

53:01.712 --> 53:03.345
You really think
he just falls from the sky,

53:03.347 --> 53:05.214
- lands in our lap?
- What are you saying?

53:06.184 --> 53:08.817
I said it before,
maybe he's a spy.

53:10.555 --> 53:14.256
- Think about it. He drops in.
- He didn't drop in.

53:16.827 --> 53:19.562
I know this because I pulled
him from the wreckage myself.

53:20.198 --> 53:21.530
He's not a spy.

53:21.532 --> 53:22.932
You don't think
this is suspicious?

53:24.435 --> 53:26.368
This is a service weapon, okay?

53:26.370 --> 53:28.737
And you said yourself,
these make no sense.

53:29.807 --> 53:31.340
Look, why don't you
take him to Matsu.

53:31.342 --> 53:33.275
No, no, no,
he could be in on it.

53:34.679 --> 53:35.945
Something's going on.

53:41.986 --> 53:45.521
Then take these papers
and the weapon,

53:46.824 --> 53:48.324
and don't let them
out of your sight.

53:49.827 --> 53:50.793
So what, that's it?

53:53.631 --> 53:55.397
- I'm going to bed, let it go.
- But Ben.

53:57.301 --> 53:58.234
Get some rest.

54:11.816 --> 54:12.915
You don't seem yourself.

54:16.387 --> 54:17.853
You haven't in a few days now.

54:21.859 --> 54:22.992
Is everything okay?

54:23.661 --> 54:24.627
I'm fine.

54:26.497 --> 54:27.429
Really.

54:34.805 --> 54:38.540
I don't know about you girls,
but I may have overdone it with the <i>inu</i> last night.

54:39.010 --> 54:41.877
It doesn't take much
to overdo it on the <i>Okolehao</i>

54:42.546 --> 54:44.647
especially with Haku's
hands on it.

54:46.350 --> 54:47.650
That's true.

54:47.652 --> 54:49.318
A few painkillers
will set you right.

54:49.687 --> 54:51.420
I don't think I should
be using the painkillers

54:51.422 --> 54:53.722
on my self-inflicted
headache given the news.

54:54.458 --> 54:55.758
What news?

55:06.604 --> 55:07.569
What's wrong?

55:38.436 --> 55:40.402
I know a lot of you are
worried about Aylmer.

55:41.505 --> 55:42.838
Yes, he's been delayed,

55:43.774 --> 55:45.974
but we have enough food
to last until next week.

55:46.877 --> 55:47.810
We'll be fine.

55:47.812 --> 55:50.746
What if it takes
longer than a week?

55:51.015 --> 55:52.481
Then we hunt more food.

55:52.717 --> 55:53.882
But we need supplies.

55:53.884 --> 55:55.484
Not imminently, we don't.

55:56.020 --> 55:57.486
What if something's
happened to him?

55:57.922 --> 55:58.987
I'm sure he's fine.

55:58.989 --> 56:00.622
We should try and contact Kauai.

56:01.359 --> 56:02.358
And how do we do that?

56:02.360 --> 56:05.461
I don't know, with, with
flashlights from the peak?

56:05.463 --> 56:06.795
The lights
will never reach.

56:06.797 --> 56:07.963
I don't hear you
coming up with any ideas.

56:07.965 --> 56:09.365
It can be done!

56:11.602 --> 56:13.669
Not with flashlights
and not at the peak,

56:13.671 --> 56:16.739
but at nightfall, we could
bring kerosene from Paniau.

56:17.007 --> 56:18.607
We could maybe signal Kauai

56:18.609 --> 56:20.576
if I can find
a reflector of sorts.

56:22.613 --> 56:23.696
Find a reflector.

56:23.697 --> 56:24.780
Haku will organize some
kerosene with you.

56:26.550 --> 56:27.850
We give Aylmer one more day.

56:29.086 --> 56:30.853
Until then, we go on as normal.

56:41.866 --> 56:42.798
What was that?

57:02.586 --> 57:05.654
I know what you said, but
we need more medical supplies.

57:06.457 --> 57:08.056
Our rations were already low,

57:08.058 --> 57:09.591
and we used most
of them on Shigenori.

57:09.593 --> 57:13.562
- This can't wait?
- There are those who can wait and those who can't..

57:15.433 --> 57:16.865
Aylmer may arrive tomorrow.

57:17.201 --> 57:18.467
Or he may not.

57:19.537 --> 57:20.936
What do you suggest we do?

57:22.440 --> 57:24.773
Contact him, walk away.

57:24.775 --> 57:26.508
Matsu's already going
to use kerosene--

57:26.510 --> 57:27.976
And how long will
that take, Ben?

57:27.978 --> 57:29.611
We need to act quicker.

57:29.613 --> 57:31.146
With what? We have
no telephones,

57:31.148 --> 57:32.781
we have no way
of contacting him.

57:32.783 --> 57:33.849
What if there was?

57:38.022 --> 57:41.723
There may be an unused radio
in with all the other junk.

57:41.725 --> 57:44.593
- May?
- Yeah, I haven't seen it in a while,

57:44.595 --> 57:46.462
and I don't know
if it's still working,

57:46.464 --> 57:47.529
but it's worth a shot.

57:47.531 --> 57:48.597
Find it.

57:49.667 --> 57:50.599
I'll help.

57:51.135 --> 57:52.134
See?

58:15.793 --> 58:16.892
Hey, what about Shigenori?

58:17.528 --> 58:18.527
What about him?

58:18.529 --> 58:21.663
- Maybe we can get on his plane--
- No, the plane is gone.

58:21.899 --> 58:23.198
That's not an option.

58:26.237 --> 58:27.169
Okay.

58:28.572 --> 58:30.038
I'm just trying
to help, you know?

58:31.008 --> 58:32.508
I'm an ideas man.

58:33.143 --> 58:34.843
You know, that's why I need you.

58:34.845 --> 58:37.112
Or Ben or Matsu, you know?

58:37.114 --> 58:38.547
It's to keep me right.

58:44.989 --> 58:46.655
You don't honestly believe

58:46.657 --> 58:48.624
a disused radio
will work, do you?

58:49.927 --> 58:52.227
I don't know, that's
why I'm looking for it,

58:52.897 --> 58:54.062
which is
what you should be doin'.

58:55.099 --> 58:57.533
I was, I've checked
all that side.

58:57.535 --> 58:58.834
Then let's switch.

58:58.836 --> 59:00.269
Double check,
no room for errors.

59:00.271 --> 59:01.737
Come on, Kumu,

59:01.739 --> 59:03.005
this is what you
taught me, you know?

59:06.110 --> 59:08.010
But yeah, I do, you know?

59:08.012 --> 59:10.913
If we can contact
Kauai and Aylmer,

59:11.749 --> 59:14.917
we can find out what's going on,
and if nothing else,

59:15.819 --> 59:17.586
we just let them know
we need more supplies.

59:17.588 --> 59:19.154
That's if we find it.

59:27.898 --> 59:29.331
If?

59:29.333 --> 59:30.966
Yahoo!

59:31.669 --> 59:32.801
Yeah!

59:39.076 --> 59:39.942
Done.

59:40.945 --> 59:43.579
See, I know you'd get
it working, man.

59:43.581 --> 59:44.613
That's why you help Aylmer.

59:44.615 --> 59:45.714
You know this stuff.

59:48.686 --> 59:49.618
We'll see.

01:00:08.172 --> 01:00:14.776
<i>Indeed,
one hour after Japanese air squadrons</i>

01:00:14.778 --> 01:00:18.747
<i>had commenced bombing</i>
<i>in the island of Oahu,</i>

01:00:19.683 --> 01:00:23.051
<i>the Japanese ambassador</i>
<i>to the United States</i>

01:00:24.288 --> 01:00:27.689
<i>delivered a formal reply</i>

01:00:28.158 --> 01:00:30.626
<i>to a recent American message.</i>

01:00:32.029 --> 01:00:36.898
<i>And while this reply stated</i>
<i>that it seemed useless</i>

01:00:36.900 --> 01:00:41.103
<i>to continue the existing</i>
<i>diplomatic negotiations,</i>

01:00:41.972 --> 01:00:46.141
<i>it contained no threat or hint</i>

01:00:46.944 --> 01:00:49.845
<i>of war or of armed attack.</i>

01:00:51.682 --> 01:00:57.853
<i>It will be recorded that the distance of Hawaii from Japan</i>

01:00:58.889 --> 01:01:02.858
<i>makes it obvious that the attack</i>
<i>was deliberately planned</i>

01:01:02.860 --> 01:01:07.029
<i>many days or even weeks ago.</i>

01:01:07.965 --> 01:01:12.234
<i>- December 7th, 1941...</i>
- Ben, wait!

01:01:12.736 --> 01:01:16.171
<i>...a date which will</i>
<i>live in infamy.</i>

01:01:29.453 --> 01:01:31.119
They know, you must leave now!

01:01:33.957 --> 01:01:35.157
No! Ben--

01:01:55.713 --> 01:02:00.248
You couldn't have known,
no one could, no one did.

01:02:17.267 --> 01:02:18.266
What are you doing?

01:02:18.268 --> 01:02:20.652
You were supposed
to be watching him!

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:23.037
You heard what he did,
he's got this coming to him!

01:02:23.040 --> 01:02:24.406
That's not your call to make!

01:02:25.375 --> 01:02:27.175
And whose is it, yours?

01:02:27.778 --> 01:02:29.244
Why is it okay for
you to strike him?

01:02:29.246 --> 01:02:31.046
- I was angry.
- So are we!

01:02:39.123 --> 01:02:42.257
No one touches him, no one.

01:03:00.844 --> 01:03:01.543
Heard about Aka.

01:03:01.544 --> 01:03:02.243
I'm not discussing
this with you.

01:03:05.082 --> 01:03:06.448
People are angry, Ben,

01:03:07.351 --> 01:03:08.917
and we can't hold him
in there forever.

01:03:08.919 --> 01:03:11.019
We can until help arrives.

01:03:11.021 --> 01:03:12.454
Who, Aylmer?

01:03:14.391 --> 01:03:16.224
We take shifts, watch him.

01:03:17.027 --> 01:03:19.394
Tonight Izzy,
tomorrow Haku, and so on.

01:03:20.164 --> 01:03:21.229
And what about them?

01:03:23.167 --> 01:03:24.566
- When Aylmer arrives--
- Aylmer's not coming!

01:03:24.568 --> 01:03:26.268
Keep your voice down.

01:03:28.939 --> 01:03:30.405
For all we know, he's dead.

01:03:30.874 --> 01:03:33.241
I said, keep your voice down.

01:03:34.444 --> 01:03:36.545
They knew, Ben, they knew.

01:03:36.547 --> 01:03:38.280
Shigenori could have
lied to them,

01:03:38.282 --> 01:03:40.582
just as he lied to us, to me.

01:03:41.919 --> 01:03:43.051
That's not true.

01:03:43.053 --> 01:03:45.187
- You don't know that.
- I know more than you!

01:03:46.423 --> 01:03:48.490
I told you something
was off, didn't I?

01:03:49.259 --> 01:03:52.327
- But no, you wouldn't listen.
- That's enough, Hawila!

01:03:55.232 --> 01:03:58.099
The people need to know who's
making our decisions for us.

01:03:59.002 --> 01:04:00.902
If you've been wrong
about everything else,

01:04:01.138 --> 01:04:03.271
what makes you think you're
the man to lead us now?

01:04:05.542 --> 01:04:06.474
And you are?

01:04:09.346 --> 01:04:10.312
I could be.

01:04:17.855 --> 01:04:19.487
My name is Ben Kanahele.

01:04:27.464 --> 01:04:28.597
Its protector.

01:04:30.901 --> 01:04:34.202
Following John Reaney
by decree of Aylmer Robinson.

01:04:35.372 --> 01:04:39.107
If anyone here sees fit that
I relinquish that title,

01:04:40.611 --> 01:04:42.644
then use your voice now!

01:04:48.252 --> 01:04:50.252
If anyone thinks they can handle

01:04:50.254 --> 01:04:53.889
the situation better
than I, speak now!

01:05:00.097 --> 01:05:04.399
If anyone here thinks that the best interests of this island

01:05:04.401 --> 01:05:07.302
do not beat with the blood
of my heart,

01:05:08.538 --> 01:05:09.938
then speak now!

01:05:18.482 --> 01:05:22.017
We keep the prisoner
until Aylmer arrives.

01:05:23.921 --> 01:05:25.320
He'll be detained
in the guest hut.

01:05:27.224 --> 01:05:28.657
Tonight, Izzy will guard him,

01:05:30.961 --> 01:05:33.628
Hawila, you watch
the beach at daybreak.

01:05:34.564 --> 01:05:35.463
And you?

01:05:36.266 --> 01:05:37.299
I'll man the radio.

01:06:05.128 --> 01:06:06.127
Did he say much?

01:06:08.699 --> 01:06:09.631
No.

01:06:11.501 --> 01:06:13.635
Just stared
at a photograph all night.

01:06:23.613 --> 01:06:25.347
<i>...in Midway.</i>

01:06:28.185 --> 01:06:30.085
<i>It has</i>
<i>therefore undertaken...</i>

01:06:30.087 --> 01:06:31.319
How are you holding up?

01:06:31.321 --> 01:06:33.388
<i>...offensive except...</i>

01:06:33.390 --> 01:06:36.191
- No news.
<i>- ...extending throughout the Pacific area.</i>

01:06:36.193 --> 01:06:37.559
Well, that is not what I asked.

01:06:38.261 --> 01:06:41.296
<i>The facts of yesterday</i>

01:06:41.298 --> 01:06:44.265
<i>and today speak for themselves.</i>

01:06:44.267 --> 01:06:46.701
I don't know what
to tell these people, Ella.

01:06:46.703 --> 01:06:49.571
<i>The people of</i>
<i>the United States have already</i>

01:06:49.573 --> 01:06:51.773
<i>formed their opinions</i>

01:06:51.775 --> 01:06:55.343
<i>and well understand</i>
<i>the implications</i>

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:59.214
<i>to the very life</i>
<i>and safety of our nation.</i>

01:06:59.216 --> 01:07:01.683
They don't need words, Ben.

01:07:01.685 --> 01:07:04.552
<i>As Commander-in-Chief</i>
<i>of the Army and Navy,</i>

01:07:04.554 --> 01:07:06.721
<i>- I have directed that all measures be taken...</i>
- They know you'll do

01:07:06.723 --> 01:07:09.257
- what's best for the island.
<i>- ...for our defense.</i>

01:07:10.627 --> 01:07:14.562
<i>But always will our whole nation</i>

01:07:15.465 --> 01:07:20.301
<i>remember the character of</i>
<i>the armed force against them.</i>

01:07:21.238 --> 01:07:22.303
What do you need?

01:07:25.475 --> 01:07:27.742
I just need you to tell
me that you love me,

01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:31.646
and I know I'll be okay.

01:07:51.101 --> 01:07:52.600
I'll leave you two alone.

01:07:52.602 --> 01:07:56.121
<i>...that we</i>
<i>will not only defend ourselves</i>

01:07:56.122 --> 01:07:59.641
<i>to the uttermost,</i>
<i>but will make it very certain</i>

01:08:00.410 --> 01:08:05.447
<i>that this form of treachery</i>
<i>shall never again endanger us.</i>

01:08:06.149 --> 01:08:07.082
What do you want?

01:08:08.185 --> 01:08:11.086
Leniency for Shigenori.

01:08:11.388 --> 01:08:13.321
How about leniency
for the men across the water

01:08:13.323 --> 01:08:14.456
who died on Sunday.

01:08:14.691 --> 01:08:16.758
You don't know
how involved he was.

01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:17.692
We know enough.

01:08:17.694 --> 01:08:19.144
<i>Blinking at the fact...</i>

01:08:19.145 --> 01:08:20.595
24 hours ago,

01:08:20.596 --> 01:08:22.296
<i>- ...that our people...</i>
- he was a friend

01:08:22.299 --> 01:08:23.598
- of the island.
<i>- ...our territory</i>

01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:24.599
<i>- And our interests.</i>
- Of yours.

01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:25.700
Because he lied to us!

01:08:25.702 --> 01:08:27.268
He didn't have a choice.

01:08:28.505 --> 01:08:29.703
Look how we're reacted.

01:08:30.573 --> 01:08:32.107
<i>In our armed forces,</i>

01:08:32.676 --> 01:08:34.408
<i>- with the unbounding...</i>
- We wait until tomorrow.

01:08:34.411 --> 01:08:36.511
<i>...determination of our people.</i>

01:08:36.513 --> 01:08:37.879
Aylmer can take him
back to Kauai.

01:08:37.881 --> 01:08:39.481
If Aylmer doesn't arrive?

01:08:39.483 --> 01:08:40.881
Then I'll take him myself!

01:08:40.884 --> 01:08:41.850
To Kauai?

01:08:42.586 --> 01:08:43.618
That's crazy!

01:08:43.620 --> 01:08:44.752
If it's what I need to do.

01:08:46.857 --> 01:08:47.639
And then what?

01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:48.421
What do you think
they'll do to him?

01:08:51.528 --> 01:08:52.861
Whatever they see fit.

01:08:54.831 --> 01:08:57.665
It's not up to me, or to us,

01:08:57.667 --> 01:08:59.801
to punish him
or to show leniency.

01:09:03.372 --> 01:09:05.473
I'm done talking
about this, Yoshio.

01:09:07.144 --> 01:09:13.747
<i>1941,</i>
<i>a state of war has existed</i>

01:09:14.618 --> 01:09:19.254
<i>between the United States</i>
<i>and the Japanese Empire.</i>

01:09:32.702 --> 01:09:35.370
What, uh-- what are you doing?

01:09:36.640 --> 01:09:38.606
Aylmer's no show is a lifeline.

01:09:40.377 --> 01:09:42.277
They aren't gonna let
Shigenori just leave.

01:09:42.279 --> 01:09:44.511
Not for Shigenori, for us.

01:09:44.814 --> 01:09:45.779
For us?

01:09:46.883 --> 01:09:48.649
You still don't get it, Yoshio?

01:09:49.452 --> 01:09:50.752
Look at what our
so-called friends

01:09:50.754 --> 01:09:52.319
have already done to Shigenori.

01:09:53.557 --> 01:09:55.823
They think of us as more
Japanese than Hawaiian.

01:09:57.627 --> 01:10:00.695
Our skin is a little different,
our voice is a little off.

01:10:01.665 --> 01:10:04.465
They don't see our person,
they see our heritage,

01:10:04.467 --> 01:10:06.301
which make us as their enemy.

01:10:11.241 --> 01:10:14.309
Do you honestly think everything
will go back to normal?

01:10:16.947 --> 01:10:20.548
It's only a matter of time
and it will only get worse.

01:10:21.351 --> 01:10:22.450
We need to leave!

01:10:22.986 --> 01:10:24.219
And go where?

01:10:25.922 --> 01:10:28.957
Let's just hope Shigenori
knows where his submarine is.

01:10:42.639 --> 01:10:43.671
I thought you'd be hungry.

01:10:45.442 --> 01:10:46.808
See, this I why I love you.

01:10:47.510 --> 01:10:49.477
Well, I was hoping
it'd be more than that.

01:10:53.450 --> 01:10:54.616
How long are you here?

01:10:55.652 --> 01:10:56.751
A few more hours.

01:10:57.554 --> 01:10:58.753
And then?

01:10:58.755 --> 01:11:00.255
Then we change it up.

01:11:00.257 --> 01:11:01.022
I meant for you.

01:11:03.026 --> 01:11:04.993
I don't know.
Why, what do you suggest?

01:11:06.396 --> 01:11:08.663
I suggest you come
to the medical hut.

01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:12.967
And why would I wanna
go to the medical hut?

01:11:16.706 --> 01:11:17.939
- Yeah?
- Hmm.

01:11:25.849 --> 01:11:26.781
How is he?

01:11:28.018 --> 01:11:29.717
Argh! Who knows?

01:11:30.553 --> 01:11:33.688
He hasn't said a word,
he just sits there

01:11:33.690 --> 01:11:35.323
and stares at his photograph.

01:11:38.662 --> 01:11:39.594
Poor guy.

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:43.464
It is what it is.

01:11:45.368 --> 01:11:48.970
He's in there all alone,
no one to talk to,

01:11:48.972 --> 01:11:50.004
nothing to pass the time.

01:11:50.006 --> 01:11:51.072
He's being kept locked up,

01:11:51.074 --> 01:11:52.440
it's not supposed to be fun.

01:11:56.813 --> 01:11:59.013
I mean, like I said,
maybe it is what it is.

01:12:02.552 --> 01:12:03.951
Hey come on, give me a smile.

01:12:06.923 --> 01:12:07.855
Come on.

01:12:12.329 --> 01:12:13.761
I got to go.

01:12:13.763 --> 01:12:15.363
Hey, wait.

01:12:18.768 --> 01:12:20.568
- Tell me.
- You don't deserve it.

01:12:20.570 --> 01:12:22.503
I know I don't, but
tell me anyway.

01:12:26.376 --> 01:12:27.675
I love you, Haku.

01:12:30.513 --> 01:12:31.446
I love you too.

01:12:40.623 --> 01:12:42.657
Seriously, I got to go.

01:12:43.460 --> 01:12:44.525
See you later?

01:12:44.527 --> 01:12:48.363
I'll be right here,
counting down the minutes.

01:13:34.477 --> 01:13:36.544
It's late now again,
why are you guys here?

01:13:36.980 --> 01:13:38.446
He hasn't eaten.

01:13:38.882 --> 01:13:40.448
Unless you'll share that.

01:13:46.723 --> 01:13:47.655
Five minutes.

01:13:49.893 --> 01:13:51.025
Thanks Haku.

01:14:02.439 --> 01:14:03.771
<i>Go ahead, Honolulu.</i>

01:14:04.541 --> 01:14:06.207
<i>And several planes</i>
<i>have been shot down,</i>

01:14:06.209 --> 01:14:08.976
<i>and anti-aircraft gunnery</i>
<i>is very heavy.</i>

01:14:09.679 --> 01:14:11.879
<i>All lines of communication</i>
<i>seem to be down</i>

01:14:11.881 --> 01:14:14.182
<i>between the various Army posts.</i>

01:14:14.184 --> 01:14:17.652
<i>Everyone here on the Islands were taken by surprise by the attack.</i>

01:14:18.621 --> 01:14:21.589
You look tired,
go home, get some rest.

01:14:21.591 --> 01:14:22.890
<i>Air raid on</i>
<i>these beautiful islands</i>

01:14:22.892 --> 01:14:24.559
<i>actually happened.</i>

01:14:24.561 --> 01:14:25.726
I'm not asking.

01:14:25.728 --> 01:14:28.963
- Go.
- <i>After the attack on Pearl Harbor.</i>

01:14:28.965 --> 01:14:30.998
I can pick this up for now.

01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.501
<i>Planes came in</i>
<i>from the south dropping bombs</i>

01:14:33.503 --> 01:14:35.002
<i>and incendiary bombs</i>
<i>over the city.</i>

01:14:35.738 --> 01:14:38.539
<i>One bomb hit a local factory.</i>

01:15:57.220 --> 01:15:58.152
Calm down.

01:15:58.154 --> 01:15:59.320
Hey, hey, hey, okay,

01:15:59.322 --> 01:16:00.555
you guys are done, okay?

01:16:00.557 --> 01:16:01.322
No, no, no, no, no,

01:16:01.324 --> 01:16:02.290
we already have it.

01:16:02.292 --> 01:16:03.591
No, no, no, no, no, Haku!

01:16:04.327 --> 01:16:05.860
I gave you five minutes

01:16:05.862 --> 01:16:07.278
to talk him,
and look what happened.

01:16:07.279 --> 01:16:08.695
No, he tried to kill us,
I'm surprised you guys--.

01:16:08.698 --> 01:16:10.565
- No, Shigenori!
- No, no, no!

01:16:21.644 --> 01:16:26.080
Oh my, oh my god. Haku. Haku!

01:16:27.650 --> 01:16:28.783
Haku.

01:16:29.586 --> 01:16:32.053
What have you done? Haku.

01:16:49.339 --> 01:16:52.273
He's right. We have to go.

01:16:52.275 --> 01:16:56.744
We killed him,
we killed him, we killed Haku!

01:16:57.013 --> 01:16:59.080
I'm sorry too,
but we have to go.

01:16:59.682 --> 01:17:00.648
Go where?

01:18:00.143 --> 01:18:03.077
We can't leave him here.

01:18:24.901 --> 01:18:26.267
Be quiet.

01:19:16.452 --> 01:19:17.952
They're not here.

01:19:47.350 --> 01:19:48.549
Shigenori, he's gone.

01:20:10.506 --> 01:20:13.207
I'll get supplies and meet
you both by the chapel.

01:20:43.005 --> 01:20:45.105
<i>The Army and</i>
<i>Navy went on a war basis</i>

01:20:45.107 --> 01:20:46.974
<i>on the Pacific seaboard today.</i>

01:20:46.976 --> 01:20:49.243
<i>All leaves were cancelled,</i>
<i>all furloughs revoked,</i>

01:20:49.245 --> 01:20:52.079
<i>and every man was ordered</i>
<i>to report to his station.</i>

01:20:52.515 --> 01:20:55.382
<i>The commandants of the three Naval districts on the West Coast</i>

01:20:55.384 --> 01:20:58.252
<i>appealed by every medium</i>
<i>for every officer and man</i>

01:20:58.254 --> 01:21:00.221
<i>to report to his post.</i>

01:21:00.223 --> 01:21:02.323
<i>The commander of marshalled</i>
<i>defensive forces...</i>

01:21:19.976 --> 01:21:21.942
Ella, Ella!

01:21:24.547 --> 01:21:26.280
- Get off me!
- Come down, Ella.

01:21:33.155 --> 01:21:34.121
Matsu.

01:21:36.025 --> 01:21:37.925
Before you say it,
the reflector didn't work.

01:21:37.927 --> 01:21:39.260
Shigenori is hurt.

01:21:40.563 --> 01:21:41.996
Hurt, what happened?

01:21:42.331 --> 01:21:44.999
He was shot by Hawila,
we need your help.

01:21:45.001 --> 01:21:46.500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, start again.

01:21:47.436 --> 01:21:48.969
Hawila shot him?

01:21:50.373 --> 01:21:52.239
I told you I don't want
to be a part of this.

01:21:52.241 --> 01:21:55.576
You're already part
of this, Matsu, we all are.

01:21:55.578 --> 01:21:57.311
What do you want from me?

01:21:58.414 --> 01:21:59.513
I already helped you.

01:21:59.515 --> 01:22:01.382
I made sure the island was safe.

01:22:02.218 --> 01:22:04.385
Besides, I never asked
for any of this.

01:22:05.955 --> 01:22:09.323
I just want it to go away,
for it all to go away

01:22:09.325 --> 01:22:11.558
and just let me and the island
get back to how it was.

01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:13.694
- That's all I want!
- Then help us get off

01:22:13.696 --> 01:22:15.262
the island tonight

01:22:15.264 --> 01:22:17.298
before Hawila can
raise the alarm.

01:22:18.200 --> 01:22:20.000
- Us?
- It's okay for you.

01:22:20.002 --> 01:22:21.568
They don't think
you knew about Shigenori.

01:22:22.138 --> 01:22:24.505
You can go back
to normality after all this,

01:22:27.276 --> 01:22:29.076
as long as they don't
know you helped him.

01:22:33.082 --> 01:22:35.549
- Are you threatening me now?
- I don't need to threaten you.

01:22:38.421 --> 01:22:39.203
You're Japanese.

01:22:39.204 --> 01:22:39.986
How do you think this
plays out for you

01:22:39.989 --> 01:22:41.388
if they think you're implicated?

01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:46.660
You want everything
to go back to normal?

01:22:48.497 --> 01:22:51.999
The only way that happens
is if we leave the island.

01:22:54.270 --> 01:22:57.071
- Who else knows about it?
- Only Hawila.

01:22:57.673 --> 01:23:00.507
He tore off into the forest
heading west towards the peak.

01:23:01.210 --> 01:23:03.077
He'll be circling back
to the village.

01:23:03.079 --> 01:23:04.311
We don't have much time.

01:23:21.731 --> 01:23:22.763
Is everything okay?

01:23:26.102 --> 01:23:29.169
Shigenori's hurt,
we need your help.

01:23:32.241 --> 01:23:33.407
Shigenori?

01:23:35.611 --> 01:23:36.677
Where's Haku?

01:23:43.219 --> 01:23:44.485
Irene, where's Haku?

01:23:48.491 --> 01:23:49.656
Stay there, Lani.

01:23:50.526 --> 01:23:51.592
What are you doing, Irene?

01:23:52.194 --> 01:23:53.694
Get some bandages, Matsu.

01:23:55.231 --> 01:23:57.097
No!

01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:00.134
You need to come with us.

01:24:01.604 --> 01:24:03.203
Irene, this is not what you
want to do, okay?

01:24:03.205 --> 01:24:04.805
Just get some bandages, Matsu!

01:24:12.748 --> 01:24:17.084
Yoshio, what are you
thinking, hmm?

01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:18.786
Please be quiet.

01:24:18.788 --> 01:24:23.057
Well, what are you gonna do when
everyone finds out about this?

01:24:24.727 --> 01:24:26.293
When Ben finds out?

01:24:28.364 --> 01:24:31.532
As I said, be quiet.

01:24:47.216 --> 01:24:48.849
- What's going on?
- I was right,

01:24:48.851 --> 01:24:50.517
I was right all along.

01:24:50.519 --> 01:24:52.286
The, the-- They came for me,
but I shot him.

01:24:52.288 --> 01:24:53.454
I shot him and escaped.

01:24:53.456 --> 01:24:55.823
- Shot who?
- Shigenori.

01:25:49.612 --> 01:25:51.545
We need to get everyone
out of the village.

01:25:52.515 --> 01:25:53.480
Leave it to me.

01:25:55.384 --> 01:25:57.184
You can take 'em to
my family's burial cairn.

01:25:58.187 --> 01:25:59.319
They'll be safe there.

01:26:01.490 --> 01:26:02.523
Okay, come on.

01:26:04.226 --> 01:26:05.159
Hawila.

01:26:07.329 --> 01:26:08.795
You said they came for you.

01:26:09.932 --> 01:26:10.864
Who is they?

01:26:12.668 --> 01:26:13.700
Yoshio and Irene.

01:26:17.373 --> 01:26:18.305
Why you?

01:26:20.476 --> 01:26:21.575
For these.

01:26:25.714 --> 01:26:26.747
Come with me.

01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:32.319
Someone else has the same idea.

01:26:32.321 --> 01:26:35.656
- You're not going to Kauai.
- It's the only way.

01:26:35.858 --> 01:26:38.325
A rowboat? That'll take hours.

01:26:38.594 --> 01:26:39.893
I'm not saying it will be easy.

01:26:39.895 --> 01:26:41.528
No, it's too dangerous.

01:26:42.364 --> 01:26:43.597
It's what needs to be done.

01:26:45.568 --> 01:26:46.667
I'll go.

01:26:49.805 --> 01:26:52.372
I made the trip before,
I know the Kaulakahi Channel.

01:26:56.712 --> 01:26:59.313
I wanna help the island,
this is my chance.

01:27:00.916 --> 01:27:02.849
I'll take the papers
to Kauai and bring back help.

01:27:03.385 --> 01:27:04.518
Let me do it.

01:27:06.555 --> 01:27:07.621
Let me do it.

01:27:10.626 --> 01:27:11.692
You sure you'll be okay?

01:27:21.370 --> 01:27:22.402
What are you gonna do?

01:27:23.439 --> 01:27:24.838
I'm going to find my wife.

01:27:28.944 --> 01:27:29.977
Yoshio.

01:27:32.581 --> 01:27:34.748
You can stop this, let me go.

01:27:38.387 --> 01:27:39.886
It's gone too far.

01:27:39.888 --> 01:27:41.655
Nothing has happened yet.

01:27:51.033 --> 01:27:52.032
Ella.

01:28:02.411 --> 01:28:04.978
- What is she doing here?
- She saw us.

01:28:08.617 --> 01:28:10.617
It's okay, we'll be fine.

01:28:10.619 --> 01:28:11.785
Haku.

01:28:19.928 --> 01:28:22.529
Lani, I'm sorry.

01:28:22.531 --> 01:28:24.765
No, no, I won't help him.

01:28:49.058 --> 01:28:50.691
Don't you touch her!

01:28:51.460 --> 01:28:53.860
- No, no!
- Are you crazy?

01:28:53.862 --> 01:28:57.631
I'll do it,
I'll do it, I'll do it!

01:28:58.567 --> 01:29:00.701
It's okay, I'll do it.

01:29:02.504 --> 01:29:04.338
Shigenori, please sit down.

01:29:04.907 --> 01:29:06.740
Please, Shigenori, sit down.

01:29:11.980 --> 01:29:12.913
It's okay.

01:29:18.387 --> 01:29:19.920
We need to find Hawila.

01:29:19.922 --> 01:29:21.521
What? No.

01:29:21.523 --> 01:29:23.690
Shigenori will kill
everyone in the village,

01:29:24.026 --> 01:29:26.026
starting with all
of us if we don't.

01:29:26.028 --> 01:29:27.127
Then you do it.

01:29:28.364 --> 01:29:30.397
We're not asking, Matsu.

01:29:31.033 --> 01:29:33.867
Find Ben, tell him Ella is here.

01:29:34.670 --> 01:29:37.738
- You know he'll go crazy when he finds out--
- He'll find Hawila.

01:29:39.074 --> 01:29:40.006
Do it!

01:29:49.418 --> 01:29:51.017
- Where is Ben?
- That depends.

01:29:52.154 --> 01:29:53.086
On what?

01:29:53.956 --> 01:29:55.522
On whether he's looking for me

01:29:58.994 --> 01:30:00.660
or whether he's looking for you.

01:30:05.167 --> 01:30:06.700
<i>State of emergency...</i>

01:30:25.421 --> 01:30:26.920
- Yoshio and Irene are--
- I know.

01:30:29.158 --> 01:30:30.090
I know.

01:30:34.129 --> 01:30:37.130
I didn't mean for this
to happen!

01:30:39.101 --> 01:30:40.467
I'm sorry, Ben.

01:30:42.504 --> 01:30:44.838
Where are they? Where is Ella?

01:31:04.059 --> 01:31:05.592
Why are you doing this to us?

01:31:07.763 --> 01:31:09.062
You're one of us.

01:31:09.731 --> 01:31:12.866
You don't understand, you can't.

01:31:14.069 --> 01:31:15.035
It's complicated.

01:31:18.106 --> 01:31:20.740
Maybe you were too blind
to see what was coming.

01:31:22.077 --> 01:31:23.243
I'm not.

01:31:23.245 --> 01:31:27.247
- We would've protected you.
- Like you protected him.

01:31:27.249 --> 01:31:29.549
- That was different.
- Was it?

01:31:30.652 --> 01:31:32.586
You saw how fast
the village turned,

01:31:32.855 --> 01:31:35.021
locked up like
an animal, attacked.

01:31:35.557 --> 01:31:36.690
We'd have been next.

01:31:37.226 --> 01:31:39.793
As you said,
you can't understand.

01:31:40.562 --> 01:31:42.496
But I did what I did
for the island.

01:31:43.699 --> 01:31:45.031
You tell that to Lani.

01:31:47.035 --> 01:31:48.168
You tell that to Haku.

01:31:53.041 --> 01:31:54.641
It was one thing
and then another.

01:31:54.643 --> 01:31:55.575
It got out of hand.

01:32:07.523 --> 01:32:08.588
Are you okay?

01:32:09.157 --> 01:32:10.090
Yes.

01:32:12.928 --> 01:32:13.860
What do you want?

01:32:15.831 --> 01:32:17.764
You know what I want.

01:32:18.267 --> 01:32:19.633
Then go.

01:32:20.702 --> 01:32:21.835
We won't stop you.

01:32:22.938 --> 01:32:24.304
We need his documents.

01:32:24.806 --> 01:32:27.641
Hawila have them. He ran off.

01:32:28.310 --> 01:32:30.176
Find him and bring him
back him back to us.

01:32:30.679 --> 01:32:33.046
Once we get the papers,
we can leave the island.

01:32:33.315 --> 01:32:35.282
This doesn't have
to be this way.

01:32:38.887 --> 01:32:40.887
There's nothing here for us now.

01:32:41.223 --> 01:32:43.023
Who says I know where Hawila is?

01:32:43.025 --> 01:32:45.091
You know this island
better than anyone.

01:32:46.628 --> 01:32:47.794
You'll be able to find him.

01:32:51.867 --> 01:32:52.866
And if I say no?

01:32:52.868 --> 01:32:58.738
Then everyone
on this island will die!

01:32:59.741 --> 01:33:00.707
It's okay.

01:33:06.248 --> 01:33:10.617
You once spoke of being
a warrior who wanted peace.

01:33:13.355 --> 01:33:15.922
Better to be
a warrior in a garden,

01:33:17.192 --> 01:33:18.758
than a gardener in a war.

01:33:23.932 --> 01:33:25.265
This is your last chance.

01:33:28.770 --> 01:33:30.236
Yes, it is.

01:33:34.643 --> 01:33:35.909
It's the only way.

01:33:36.311 --> 01:33:40.046
Find Hawila, no one
else needs to get hurt.

01:33:45.387 --> 01:33:46.720
I love you.

01:34:46.948 --> 01:34:50.116
We need to think about
options, about leaving.

01:34:51.353 --> 01:34:52.285
You heard him.

01:34:53.221 --> 01:34:54.254
I'm not talking about him.

01:35:02.097 --> 01:35:03.029
Where is it?

01:35:03.832 --> 01:35:04.764
It's gone.

01:35:05.767 --> 01:35:07.033
Gone, gone where?

01:35:07.302 --> 01:35:08.435
It can't just go!

01:35:08.437 --> 01:35:09.769
It didn't.

01:35:13.475 --> 01:35:14.407
Hawila.

01:36:07.529 --> 01:36:08.762
Let her go!

01:36:33.522 --> 01:36:35.388
No, no, no, no, no!

01:37:06.488 --> 01:37:08.555
Here, Matsu! Matsu!

01:37:09.825 --> 01:37:11.591
Irene, no! Irene, no!

01:37:15.030 --> 01:37:16.029
Ah!

01:37:23.371 --> 01:37:24.437
Ben!

01:38:10.418 --> 01:38:12.118
I didn't mean for
this to happen.

01:38:28.536 --> 01:38:29.402
Matsu!

01:39:00.969 --> 01:39:02.235
Ben!

01:39:03.071 --> 01:39:04.003
Don't do this.

01:39:05.573 --> 01:39:07.073
You don't have to.

01:39:30.498 --> 01:39:31.431
Do it!

01:39:48.249 --> 01:39:49.182
Ben!

01:39:52.654 --> 01:39:56.155
No, no! No.

01:39:56.157 --> 01:39:57.690
- I don't want to die.
- You're not going to die,

01:39:57.692 --> 01:39:59.292
I'm not gonna let you die.

01:40:03.064 --> 01:40:04.530
I'm not gonna let you die.

01:40:27.622 --> 01:40:29.689
I didn't mean for
this to happen.

01:40:32.160 --> 01:40:33.559
I was trying to help.

01:40:35.563 --> 01:40:37.163
We were trying to help.

01:40:39.234 --> 01:40:41.467
I didn't mean
for this to happen.

01:40:43.204 --> 01:40:44.137
Yoshio.

01:40:52.647 --> 01:40:53.579
I love you.

01:40:57.652 --> 01:40:59.452
None of this is her fault.

01:41:00.188 --> 01:41:02.422
It was me, it was all me.

01:41:05.660 --> 01:41:06.626
I'm sorry.

01:41:06.628 --> 01:41:09.062
Yoshio,
put the gun down.

01:41:11.533 --> 01:41:13.232
- This is my fate.
- No!

01:41:13.668 --> 01:41:15.668
- But it needn't be yours!
- No!

01:42:42.590 --> 01:42:43.589
Here!

01:42:46.161 --> 01:42:47.360
We're over here!

01:42:57.172 --> 01:42:58.171
We're over here.

01:43:23.765 --> 01:43:25.765
It's Aylmer.
Is everybody all right?

01:44:02.670 --> 01:44:03.603
No!

01:44:06.574 --> 01:44:08.774
Why are you taking him,
why are you taking him?

01:44:08.776 --> 01:44:10.376
He didn't do anything!

01:44:21.322 --> 01:44:22.922
Matsu. Matsu!

01:46:11.366 --> 01:46:16.068
<i>¶ A fond embrace ¶</i>

01:46:20.875 --> 01:46:27.513
<i>¶ Until we meet again ¶</i>

01:47:25.173 --> 01:47:30.009
<i>¶ A fond embrace ¶</i>

01:47:34.949 --> 01:47:40.986
<i>¶ Until we meet again ¶</i>

01:47:44.125 --> 01:47:50.729
<i>¶ Until we meet again ¶</i>

01:47:51.305 --> 01:47:57.152
