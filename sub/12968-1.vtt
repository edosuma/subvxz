00:16.265 --> 00:19.811
I wouldn't want to live his life,
'cause he hasn't been happy all of his life.

00:19.895 --> 00:23.231
All I think is, if you can
find work, stay healthy...

00:23.315 --> 00:25.483
find somebody to share it with,
you're the ultimate success.

00:25.567 --> 00:29.070
He's had some of the pieces
of the puzzle, but not all of them.

00:30.364 --> 00:33.282
"I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear..."

00:33.367 --> 00:35.451
I, Ronald Reagan, do solemnly swear...

00:35.536 --> 00:39.997
"That I will faithfully execute the office
of President of the United States."

00:40.082 --> 00:42.083
That I will faithfully execute the office...

00:50.718 --> 00:54.846
When you're young,
your potential is infinite.

00:54.930 --> 00:57.849
You might do anything, really.

00:57.933 --> 01:00.309
You might be Einstein.

01:00.894 --> 01:02.979
You might be DiMaggio.

01:04.732 --> 01:07.608
Then you get to an age
when what you might be...

01:07.693 --> 01:10.194
gives way to what you have been.

01:10.279 --> 01:11.904
You weren't Einstein.

01:12.448 --> 01:13.990
You weren't anything.

01:15.868 --> 01:17.493
That's a bad moment.

01:36.889 --> 01:38.639
Chuck, it's Pen.

01:40.893 --> 01:44.687
Hey! Jesus. How'd you find me?

01:44.772 --> 01:47.607
You wrote me your last letter
on hotel stationery.

01:50.110 --> 01:52.069
It's great to see you, Pen.

01:52.154 --> 01:54.030
You look beautiful.

01:54.990 --> 01:56.824
This place is scary.

01:57.910 --> 02:01.162
Yeah. The human psyche.

02:01.705 --> 02:04.540
I came to take you back
to California with me.

02:05.751 --> 02:08.127
- No.
- It's a lonely state without you.

02:09.086 --> 02:11.088
I'm home, Red.

02:19.014 --> 02:22.433
I can't wait forever for you to marry me.

02:23.727 --> 02:28.731
Well, apparently, I can,
but I really don't want to.

02:36.532 --> 02:39.075
I love you so much.

02:43.872 --> 02:46.290
You don't understand.

02:47.668 --> 02:49.544
I don't even know why.

02:49.628 --> 02:51.337
Penny.

02:52.381 --> 02:54.257
Penny, Penny, Penny.

03:13.443 --> 03:17.488
Listen, I gotta go, okay?
I'm kind of busy right now, okay?

03:18.740 --> 03:20.825
It was 1981...

03:20.909 --> 03:25.121
and I had holed myself up
in this New York hotel...

03:25.205 --> 03:26.998
the Phoenix Hotel...

03:27.082 --> 03:30.877
terrified of everything, ashamed of my life.

03:34.798 --> 03:37.842
Until, finally, I realized my salvation...

03:37.926 --> 03:41.929
might be in recording
my wasted life unflinchingly.

03:42.514 --> 03:46.517
Maybe it would serve as a cautionary tale...

03:46.602 --> 03:49.020
and maybe it would help me understand why.

03:50.314 --> 03:53.274
When I was 11, I had an experience...

03:53.358 --> 03:57.862
with my sister's friend Tuvia
that left an indelible impression.

03:57.946 --> 03:59.447
- Hey.
- What?

03:59.531 --> 04:01.490
- Tuvia.
- What?

04:01.575 --> 04:03.284
You want to lick it?

04:04.828 --> 04:06.537
No. Why should I?

04:06.622 --> 04:08.915
Well, for one thing,
it tastes like strawberry.

04:08.999 --> 04:11.208
My sister tells me you love strawberries.

04:11.293 --> 04:13.878
Yeah, well, I hate strawberries.

04:13.962 --> 04:17.298
No, I'm serious.
It tastes exactly like a strawberry lollipop.

04:17.382 --> 04:18.757
I know that's not true.

04:18.841 --> 04:21.844
- I bet you it does.
- I bet you it doesn't.

04:21.928 --> 04:24.096
I'll bet you a dollar.

04:26.892 --> 04:28.601
Tuvia.

04:28.685 --> 04:30.645
My first love.

04:31.146 --> 04:33.898
Perhaps my whole life turned at that point.

04:33.982 --> 04:36.525
The repulsiveness of my sex confirmed...

04:36.610 --> 04:40.738
by the taste buds
of a ripening pubescent girl.

04:40.822 --> 04:42.156
What are you doing?

04:42.240 --> 04:43.741
Get off me!

04:43.825 --> 04:48.079
And so I found myself
in a downward spiral of debauchery...

04:48.163 --> 04:49.956
endlessly chasing pussy.

04:54.503 --> 04:57.296
My only focus in life...
to get laid, to get blown...

04:57.381 --> 04:59.090
trying to fool myself into believing...

04:59.174 --> 05:01.926
that given the right combination
of circumstances and deception...

05:02.010 --> 05:06.722
maybe the Tuvias of the world
could desire me the way I desired them.

05:08.517 --> 05:10.518
I only wanted to be loved.

05:16.942 --> 05:18.067
No.

05:33.041 --> 05:38.796
The constant inarticulate rage
led to bar fight after bar fight.

05:47.472 --> 05:49.181
New York is a city of people...

05:49.266 --> 05:53.477
the only state in the Union to stretch
from the Atlantic Ocean to the Great Lakes.

05:53.562 --> 05:55.980
Directly across the avenue is—
You're right again.

05:56.064 --> 05:59.316
I had heard that television
was an industry with a future...

05:59.401 --> 06:03.362
so I packed up and moved
from Philly to Manhattan.

06:04.531 --> 06:07.992
We began making
commercial broadcasts in 1941...

06:08.076 --> 06:12.913
and in 1953, NBC made the first ever
color telecast by a network...

06:12.998 --> 06:15.166
during The Colgate Comedy Hour.

06:15.250 --> 06:18.627
Now we'll have a look at the studio
where they produce The Today Show...

06:18.712 --> 06:22.381
which NBC began broadcasting in 1952.

06:22.466 --> 06:23.799
Excuse me, miss.

06:23.884 --> 06:26.010
Do you know where I could apply
for an NBC page?

06:26.094 --> 06:31.223
Such as The Perry Como Show,
which you can tune into on Saturdays at 7:30.

06:31.308 --> 06:32.850
The Nat King Cole Show...

06:32.934 --> 06:35.770
which you won't want to miss,
on Tuesdays at 8:00 P.M.

06:35.854 --> 06:37.855
And hold on one second.

06:39.316 --> 06:40.691
Okay.

06:40.776 --> 06:44.987
And my personal favorite,
The Lux Show starring Rosemary Clooney.

06:45.072 --> 06:47.156
Which you can enjoy
every Thursday at 10:00.

06:47.240 --> 06:50.701
And of course, The Steve Allen Show
which delights us every Sunday at 8:00.

06:50.786 --> 06:52.703
You may also be interested
to know that Steve Allen...

06:52.788 --> 06:55.748
actually got his start in entertainment
as an NBC page.

06:55.832 --> 06:57.500
Ladies and gentlemen, if you'll follow me.

06:57.584 --> 07:00.961
You know Raymond, in accounting?
He's kind of cute, huh?

07:01.046 --> 07:03.631
Cute is all well and good, Mary-Ann...

07:03.715 --> 07:07.218
but what you want
is a man who's going places...

07:07.302 --> 07:10.846
a go-getter on the management fast track.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.431
What about Mr. Waters?

07:12.516 --> 07:15.142
Yeah, management
training application, please, ma'am.

07:16.061 --> 07:18.104
How many people have applied for this so far?

07:18.188 --> 07:21.398
Let's see. Including you? About 2,000.

07:21.483 --> 07:23.859
- For how many positions?
- Five.

07:29.157 --> 07:30.658
Thanks, ma'am.

07:36.832 --> 07:41.210
Sometimes, as a younger man,
I stretched the truth to get what I wanted.

07:41.294 --> 07:43.796
- Tell me again!
- Head of network sales at 30.

07:43.880 --> 07:46.173
Head of the entire network by 40!

07:46.258 --> 07:51.679
I love you, Mr. Chuck Barris,
management trainee.

07:55.433 --> 07:57.685
Life was sweet.

08:01.523 --> 08:03.107
For a minute.

08:03.859 --> 08:07.736
Everything's either madly exciting
or madly interesting.

08:08.572 --> 08:11.991
I hope Sally never bothers herself with you.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.626
I got fired today.

08:22.711 --> 08:24.837
Fired?

08:24.921 --> 08:26.547
Yeah, fired.

08:27.549 --> 08:29.175
Fired?

08:31.678 --> 08:33.636
What the fuck did you get fired for?

08:33.722 --> 08:35.639
I don't know. Efficiency cutbacks.

08:35.724 --> 08:38.350
Some bullshit. Look, it's gonna be fine.

08:41.813 --> 08:43.813
I'm pregnant.

08:49.905 --> 08:53.157
So, I figured, I'm gonna skip town.

08:53.658 --> 08:57.328
I intend to be important, you know?
I can't be saddled with this.

08:59.039 --> 09:03.042
But then I remembered something Carlyle said.

09:03.126 --> 09:08.255
"Do the duty which lies nearest thee."

09:09.257 --> 09:11.926
- So you see...
- Who's Carlyle?

09:14.054 --> 09:17.932
Dear God. Why do I even bother?

09:18.642 --> 09:20.601
Fuck you, you condescending prick.

09:22.812 --> 09:24.063
Pregnant?

09:25.106 --> 09:27.233
Yeah, pregnant.

09:27.943 --> 09:28.901
Fuck you.

09:28.985 --> 09:30.861
What the fuck did you get pregnant for?

09:30.946 --> 09:32.029
Fuck you.

09:32.113 --> 09:34.490
What do you mean,
what the fuck did I get pregnant for?

09:34.574 --> 09:37.201
You got me fucking pregnant, you fuck!

09:37.285 --> 09:39.161
- Well, fuck you!
- Fuck you.

09:39.246 --> 09:41.789
- Fuckin'—
- Fuck you.

09:41.873 --> 09:43.040
Fuck!

09:43.124 --> 09:45.084
Fuck you.

09:53.176 --> 09:55.511
Looks like I was just late.

10:02.269 --> 10:04.395
Yes, we had a great time.

10:04.479 --> 10:09.358
The crew loved him and loved the show,
you know? Because it was crazy.

10:09.442 --> 10:12.444
And we could do anything
we wanted to, sort of.

10:12.529 --> 10:15.572
And, yeah, they liked him very much.

10:15.657 --> 10:17.074
He was a good guy.

10:17.158 --> 10:20.577
Even though he's a prick,
he's a good guy too.

10:20.662 --> 10:22.788
"What is labeled a dream faculty.

10:22.872 --> 10:25.874
Wouldn't school be wonderful
if we had a faculty like this?"

10:25.959 --> 10:27.001
You read it, all right?

10:27.085 --> 10:30.421
"Principal Sal Mineo,
Vice Principal Tony Perkins."

10:30.505 --> 10:34.800
Couldn't you see going to a school
where Sal Mineo is the principal?

10:34.884 --> 10:37.761
In '61, I had become
a minor suit at ABC.

10:37.846 --> 10:39.763
It was during the music payola scandal...

10:39.848 --> 10:42.266
so myjob was to commute
to Philly every day...

10:42.350 --> 10:46.478
to the American Bandstand tapings
to keep an eye on Dick Clark.

10:46.563 --> 10:48.439
One more lady's choice
of the afternoon to go...

10:48.523 --> 10:50.190
and suppose we make it this one, okay?

10:51.526 --> 10:54.611
On weekends,
I used to hang around amusement parks...

10:54.696 --> 10:57.614
because that's where the young girls were.

10:57.699 --> 11:01.618
I wrote a song about my experiences.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.454
When you stop at the top
of a Ferris wheel

11:03.538 --> 11:08.250
I got it to Freddy "Boom Boom" Cannon
through my friendship with Dick Clark.

11:08.335 --> 11:10.836
Dick really wanted to help me out.

11:10.920 --> 11:12.129
Hi.

11:12.213 --> 11:14.173
- What?
- Hi.

11:15.967 --> 11:17.885
I wrote this song.

11:19.971 --> 11:23.474
It's number three on the pop charts.

11:23.558 --> 11:24.558
See?

11:25.560 --> 11:27.061
Yeah.

11:28.271 --> 11:31.023
I believe there's
a great future in television.

11:32.067 --> 11:35.652
So I'm gonna take my royalties
and I'm gonna create a pilot.

11:35.737 --> 11:38.655
A pilot's what they call a test TV show.

11:38.740 --> 11:40.324
I work in TV.

11:40.408 --> 11:42.743
Yeah? What's your name? I'm Chuck.

11:42.827 --> 11:44.453
- Debbie.
- Debbie.

11:44.537 --> 11:46.038
So, you live in Philly?

11:46.122 --> 11:47.623
No, I live in Manhattan.

11:47.707 --> 11:48.999
It's gonna be a game show.

11:49.084 --> 11:51.085
I believe there's
a great future in game shows.

11:51.169 --> 11:52.711
That's good.

11:52.796 --> 11:55.881
Yeah. Everyone loves game shows, right?

11:56.674 --> 11:59.176
- I don't know.
- Well, they do.

11:59.260 --> 12:01.053
Well, that's great then.

12:01.638 --> 12:03.138
I'm on my way.

12:15.985 --> 12:17.778
Hello.

12:17.862 --> 12:19.154
Hi.

12:23.284 --> 12:25.327
Don't be alarmed.
I'm here with Debbie.

12:25.412 --> 12:28.330
Yeah, I figured that. Hungry?

12:29.290 --> 12:31.041
No, thanks.

12:31.126 --> 12:32.126
Thirsty?

12:33.086 --> 12:36.463
Sure, if you have a beer or...

12:43.346 --> 12:46.098
How was sex with Debbie?
I always wanted to know.

12:46.182 --> 12:49.685
It was good. Fine. Thanks for asking.

12:49.769 --> 12:51.270
No problem.

12:51.980 --> 12:56.316
I just got fucked by this drummer cat-
a real righteous Negro hipster.

12:56.943 --> 12:57.901
Interesting.

12:57.986 --> 13:01.905
I'm into the brotherhood of man.
I fucked an Oriental last week.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.491
- What are you?
- Jew.

13:04.576 --> 13:06.827
I had one of those once, but he was Sephardic.

13:06.911 --> 13:08.871
You look Ashke-nazi.

13:08.955 --> 13:11.665
- Ashkenazi.
- Right, Ashke-nazi.

13:13.001 --> 13:16.670
- I haven't had one of those yet.
- You're romantic.

13:16.754 --> 13:20.382
I just don't get into all the bullshit
between cats and chicks.

13:20.467 --> 13:22.676
- I know what you mean.
- You know what I mean?

13:22.760 --> 13:25.637
Besides, you just give your heart to one cat
and you get hurt.

13:25.722 --> 13:27.347
Don't I know it.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.229
We could ball if you want.

13:39.903 --> 13:41.236
That would be good.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.531
Yeah, but-

13:44.616 --> 13:47.868
I'm here with Debbie. It doesn't seem right.

13:53.833 --> 13:56.168
That's true. I didn't think of that.

13:58.254 --> 14:00.923
Well, I'm going to bed.
It was nice meeting you.

14:01.007 --> 14:02.925
Hey, what's your name?

14:04.761 --> 14:07.012
I'm Penny.

14:07.096 --> 14:08.430
I'm Chuck.

14:08.515 --> 14:10.224
- Chuck Barris.
- Yeah.

14:10.308 --> 14:11.892
Yeah, you wrote that Palisades song.

14:11.976 --> 14:14.394
- I really like that song.
- Thanks.

14:14.479 --> 14:16.230
Yeah, it's real sentimental bullshit.

14:16.773 --> 14:18.607
Right.

15:30.138 --> 15:34.850
Last night in my dream, this ape and I
are sitting staring at each other...

15:34.934 --> 15:37.477
and it was across time and evolution.

15:37.562 --> 15:41.773
And then he started talking,
but in a language I didn't really understand.

15:41.858 --> 15:44.651
Swiss, maybe.

15:45.737 --> 15:49.656
And then he turned into Perry Como-
real square.

15:49.741 --> 15:51.825
- What's wrong with you?
- Nothing.

15:51.909 --> 15:55.078
Just because we fucked
doesn't mean there are strings now.

15:55.163 --> 15:56.371
Okay.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.123
I just wanted
to tell you about my dream.

15:58.207 --> 16:00.917
Nothing more complicated than that.
Don't panic.

16:01.002 --> 16:03.962
I'm just not used to all this dating bullshit.

16:04.047 --> 16:07.758
Now we're a couple.
Now I'm obliged to give a shit what you say.

16:07.842 --> 16:10.552
Don't worry.
I'm not into those games either.

16:10.637 --> 16:15.223
So anyway, the monkey turns into Perry Como,
and I say...

16:15.308 --> 16:16.850
- Holy fuck.
- What?

16:16.934 --> 16:18.769
Holy, holy fuck.

16:18.853 --> 16:22.439
You just gave me an idea for a show. Fuck!

16:22.523 --> 16:23.982
A show about monkeys?

16:24.067 --> 16:25.942
No, about people.

16:26.027 --> 16:30.530
About sex, about romance,
about the bullshit of dating.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.117
I call it The Dating Game.

16:34.202 --> 16:37.162
And that's what it's about, Mr. Goldberg.

16:37.246 --> 16:43.377
A pretty girl asks three handsome guys-
who she can't see... silly questions.

16:43.461 --> 16:45.379
And based on their answers...

16:45.463 --> 16:49.091
she picks one to date,
and we pay for the date.

16:49.175 --> 16:50.884
That's it. That's the show.

16:59.310 --> 17:01.812
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

17:01.896 --> 17:04.146
- Hot damn!
- What? What? What?

17:04.232 --> 17:05.440
- They bought it!
- Yeah!

17:05.525 --> 17:07.150
They bought it!

17:07.234 --> 17:10.612
They're giving me 7,500 fuckin' dollars
to make a pilot!

17:10.696 --> 17:12.823
We gotta go celebrate!
Let's go roller skating!

17:12.906 --> 17:14.281
I can't! I got a date!

17:14.367 --> 17:15.826
Okay, cool. Will you call me after?

17:15.910 --> 17:17.911
- Okay!
- Okay! Bye!

18:10.965 --> 18:12.632
I figured I was in.

18:12.717 --> 18:18.221
All I had to do was get the pilot made,
and I'd be a millionaire.

18:18.306 --> 18:20.891
Everyone would love me.

18:20.975 --> 18:24.603
Was anyone ever so young?

18:24.687 --> 18:27.314
- No.
- No.

18:27.398 --> 18:28.356
No.

18:29.025 --> 18:30.567
All right. Lose it.

18:30.651 --> 18:33.069
ABC didn't like The Dating Game.

18:33.154 --> 18:35.322
They did like a show called Hootenanny.

18:35.406 --> 18:37.365
I like this one.

18:37.450 --> 18:40.494
Well, he led an amazingly long life.

18:40.578 --> 18:42.788
Hooten-fuckin'-nanny.

18:46.834 --> 18:48.126
What do they know?

18:48.211 --> 18:50.837
That's long for a dog.

18:52.757 --> 18:55.008
I don't know. Probably about 70 to you and me.

19:03.392 --> 19:06.686
It's nine years to every one of ours.

19:12.860 --> 19:14.152
Yeah.

19:19.158 --> 19:21.785
I'm sorry about your show.

19:21.869 --> 19:25.789
What? How long has he been dead?

19:25.873 --> 19:27.791
Jesus, Phoebe, that's-

19:27.875 --> 19:29.334
Yeah. No, I'll hold on.

19:29.418 --> 19:31.336
- Is that your mom?
- My sister.

19:31.420 --> 19:33.129
Come here.

19:33.214 --> 19:35.507
Oh, yeah. I got you these.

19:35.591 --> 19:36.883
Listen, Pen, I'm not-

19:36.968 --> 19:39.302
I want to tell you something.
I talked to a psychic today.

19:39.387 --> 19:41.304
- A what?
- A psychic.

19:41.389 --> 19:44.307
And she said that you are
gonna be very successful.

19:44.392 --> 19:47.143
- Really?
- Very successful.

19:47.228 --> 19:50.689
- Tarot cards?
- Tea leaves.

19:50.773 --> 19:53.650
Say that again, Phoebe. I missed it.

19:53.734 --> 19:55.402
Tuvia?

19:55.486 --> 19:57.571
No, why would I have seen her?

19:58.364 --> 20:01.700
- She did?
- Who's Tuvia?

20:01.784 --> 20:04.911
- To Manhattan?
- Who's Tuvia?

20:06.372 --> 20:07.581
Yeah.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.006
Your niece.

20:16.090 --> 20:18.633
Divorced? Really?

20:18.718 --> 20:20.927
I didn't know she got married.

20:22.013 --> 20:23.221
Yes?

20:25.892 --> 20:27.893
Hi, Tuvia.

20:31.397 --> 20:33.523
Well, if it isn't Strawberry Dick Barris.

20:33.608 --> 20:36.109
What do you want?

20:36.193 --> 20:39.154
I'm back in town for a while,
and I thought maybe...

20:39.238 --> 20:40.697
Jesus, you gotta be kidding.

20:40.781 --> 20:42.073
We could go out
and get an ice cream cone.

20:42.325 --> 20:46.036
He's so convincing
when he's talkin' with you.

20:46.120 --> 20:48.288
He could convince you of anything.

20:48.372 --> 20:54.127
He's one of the very few guys
I'd like to have on my side in a street fight.

20:54.211 --> 20:56.338
You wanna fight, you big pile of shit?

21:09.018 --> 21:11.353
You're a pretty angry young fella.

21:11.437 --> 21:14.898
- Can't fight worth a damn, though.
- Hey, screw off, queer.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.068
Don't think I haven't seen you watching me
in that bar for a week now.

21:18.152 --> 21:20.028
Kind of a loner, I'd say.

21:20.112 --> 21:22.489
Fairly bright, a tad antisocial.

21:22.573 --> 21:25.075
Mad at the world. Can I buy you lunch?

21:26.869 --> 21:30.580
There's a school yard half a block down.
Why don't you go trollin' there?

21:31.624 --> 21:33.750
I can teach you
at least 30 different ways...

21:33.834 --> 21:36.419
to kill a man with a single blow, Mr. Barris.

21:36.504 --> 21:39.422
It might help in future bar fights.
Just a thought.

21:40.841 --> 21:43.969
And there's money in it— good money.

21:45.179 --> 21:47.597
I figure if I can keep afloat...

21:47.682 --> 21:49.933
until I come up
with the next game show idea...

21:50.017 --> 21:52.018
then all would be copacetic.

21:52.103 --> 21:54.437
That sounds great, Chuck.

21:54.522 --> 21:58.274
I've never known a television producer before.
I'm impressed.

21:58.359 --> 22:00.276
Yeah. Okay.

22:00.361 --> 22:02.737
What's this money and a deal
you were talking about?

22:02.822 --> 22:05.156
I work for a government agency.

22:05.241 --> 22:07.784
We're always looking for good,
enthusiastic men...

22:07.868 --> 22:10.203
to help us carry out our directives.

22:17.378 --> 22:19.462
What kind of work? What government agency?

22:20.798 --> 22:23.633
Problem-solving work.

22:23.718 --> 22:25.593
The Office of Diplomatic Security.

22:25.678 --> 22:29.222
Office of what? I never heard of it.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.683
Is that the fuckin' CIA or something?

22:34.353 --> 22:36.896
Please be discreet, Mr. Barris.

22:49.744 --> 22:51.119
Jesus.

22:51.203 --> 22:53.246
It is the fuckin' CIA?

22:55.041 --> 22:56.958
Yeah. Hell, I'll be a spy.

22:57.043 --> 23:00.879
Where do I sign up? Are you fuckin' with me?
You're fuckin' with me, aren't you?

23:00.963 --> 23:04.632
Hardly. And you wouldn't
be working for the company.

23:04.717 --> 23:07.469
You'd be an independent contract agent.

23:07.553 --> 23:08.803
Independent.

23:08.888 --> 23:11.097
No official tie to any agency.

23:12.224 --> 23:14.225
Understand?

23:17.313 --> 23:18.772
Why me?

23:20.274 --> 23:24.235
Well, as you know, I've been watching you.
For quite some time, actually.

23:24.320 --> 23:26.863
I've only let you know about it
for the last week.

23:26.947 --> 23:30.784
I'm happy to report
you fit our profile, Mr. Barris.

23:32.119 --> 23:33.953
Are you interested in the work?

23:36.874 --> 23:38.124
What's the profile?

23:38.209 --> 23:42.378
Are you interested
in the work, Mr. Barris?

23:42.463 --> 23:44.964
Yeah, sure. I wanna be a secret agent.

23:45.049 --> 23:46.549
A contract agent, whatever.

23:46.634 --> 23:48.885
Get to fuck beautiful Eastern European women-

23:48.969 --> 23:51.387
What we do is very serious, Mr. Barris.

23:51.472 --> 23:54.390
It's essential in quelling
the rise of communism...

23:54.475 --> 23:58.978
and allowing democracy to get
its rightful foothold around the globe.

23:59.063 --> 24:01.147
You understand?

24:02.858 --> 24:04.859
Sure.

24:04.944 --> 24:06.236
Yeah.

24:06.320 --> 24:08.696
Yeah, okay. That's good.

24:24.004 --> 24:28.925
There are several efficient methods
for killing a man...

24:29.009 --> 24:30.885
were you to find yourself without a weapon.

24:32.179 --> 24:36.558
The edge of your hand
against your adversary's Adam's apple.

24:36.642 --> 24:38.977
This will crush his windpipe...

24:39.061 --> 24:41.771
causing strangulation...

24:41.856 --> 24:43.273
and death.

24:49.363 --> 24:50.864
Shit!

24:52.533 --> 24:54.701
I need another volunteer.

24:57.538 --> 25:01.124
- You're training me to be a killer.
- See, Chuck, I knew you were fairly bright.

25:01.208 --> 25:04.627
I'm not killin' people.
My future's in television.

25:04.712 --> 25:08.047
You're 32 years old,
and you've achieved nothing.

25:08.132 --> 25:12.093
Jesus Christ was dead and alive again by 33.
You better get crackin'.

25:12.178 --> 25:14.137
- I have ideas for shows.
- Good.

25:14.221 --> 25:16.723
Why don't you spend another
six months developing them...

25:16.807 --> 25:20.059
while you're staring out the window
waiting for Larry Goldberg to call.

25:21.061 --> 25:24.564
- How do you know all this?
- I know everything about you, Chuck.

25:24.648 --> 25:26.441
I know which hand you jerk off with.

25:26.525 --> 25:30.111
Left. Leave in the morning, if you want.

25:30.196 --> 25:33.323
I'm here to tell you,
this is honest work for good pay.

25:33.407 --> 25:37.035
You're making the world safer
and your country will be grateful.

25:38.454 --> 25:40.788
It'll toughen you up.

25:40.873 --> 25:42.749
Wait a second!

25:43.417 --> 25:45.835
Hey, we gotta talk about this.

25:45.920 --> 25:50.298
And there it was... my defining moment.

25:50.382 --> 25:52.926
I wasn'tjust gonna work for the CIA.

25:53.010 --> 25:55.511
I was gonna kill for them.

25:57.431 --> 25:59.724
Call it patriotism.

26:40.808 --> 26:45.770
Glycerine is, of course,
the best known nitrating agent.

26:45.854 --> 26:50.858
Keep in mind, though,
that nitro glycerine...

26:50.943 --> 26:52.986
is extremely unstable.

26:55.114 --> 26:57.573
A slight tap...

26:57.658 --> 27:01.494
a one-degree change in temperature...

27:01.578 --> 27:04.163
and it'll blow up in your hands.

27:07.835 --> 27:09.919
So, let's mix us up a batch!

27:10.004 --> 27:15.216
Everybody take your 75-milliliter beaker
and fill it up to the 13-milliliter level...

27:15.301 --> 27:18.094
with red-hot fumin' nitric acid-

27:18.178 --> 27:20.179
98% concentration.

27:23.851 --> 27:25.435
The field phone-

27:25.519 --> 27:29.772
used as an instrument of interrogation
or torture.

27:34.611 --> 27:38.197
Attaching firmly to the genitalia.

27:40.659 --> 27:42.618
Hey, Ivan!

27:42.703 --> 27:46.539
Are you now or have you ever been
a member of the Communist Party?

27:46.623 --> 27:50.043
What's your Aunt Tillie's
recipe for vodka cookies?

28:01.638 --> 28:03.431
All right, Jack.

28:03.515 --> 28:05.183
Take care, Lee.

28:31.168 --> 28:33.503
I know a lot about him
that you are not gonna know.

28:33.587 --> 28:34.921
I can't tell you.

28:35.005 --> 28:36.506
Yeah.

28:36.590 --> 28:42.136
I know some things about him
that are very distressing, and—

28:42.763 --> 28:45.973
and you wouldn't want
to know them about him.

28:59.113 --> 29:01.322
So, what did this guy Renda do, anyway?

29:01.407 --> 29:04.784
It's yourjob to follow directives,
not question their validity.

29:15.838 --> 29:17.380
Hermano, help me, please.

29:19.466 --> 29:20.466
No, no. No, no.

29:20.551 --> 29:22.301
Can I be of some assistance?

29:22.386 --> 29:23.553
He's a bad guy.

29:23.637 --> 29:25.972
He's one of the bad guys.

29:27.057 --> 29:28.724
Bad for the US, right, Jim?

29:28.809 --> 29:31.477
Not bad in an absolute sense,
just bad for the US.

29:31.562 --> 29:32.979
Don't fuckin' dance with me.

29:33.063 --> 29:36.774
Renda's bad for the Tea and Biscuit Company.
He's bad for me personally.

29:36.859 --> 29:39.569
You work for me. Renda's bad for me.

29:39.653 --> 29:43.698
You're now officially a patriotic citizen
of the United States ofJim Byrd.

29:43.782 --> 29:46.701
There's no backing out now.
We've let you in on everything.

29:46.785 --> 29:48.453
You don't play, you don't leave.

29:48.537 --> 29:52.331
You understand that?
You don't play, you don't leave.

29:56.003 --> 29:58.171
I like you. I do.

29:58.255 --> 30:02.341
And you're gonna do fine tomorrow,
and we're gonna become good friends.

30:07.973 --> 30:10.850
You can have a nice little career,
but you have to grow up.

30:10.934 --> 30:12.351
There's a war on.

30:55.312 --> 30:57.647
Beautiful country, isn't it?

30:57.731 --> 30:58.940
Yeah.

31:00.400 --> 31:02.902
You did us proud today, Chuck.

31:04.071 --> 31:07.949
Renda was a bad guy. He really was.

31:16.583 --> 31:18.501
Chuck, is that you?

31:18.710 --> 31:21.671
Jesus Christ, Pen!
You scared the shit out of me.

31:21.755 --> 31:23.047
- Were you throwing up?
- What are you doing here?

31:23.131 --> 31:26.509
I've been crashing here for a while.
I've been waiting for you. Where you been?

31:26.593 --> 31:28.511
Mexico. I was just on a little vacation.

31:28.595 --> 31:30.721
You didn't drink the water, did you?

31:30.806 --> 31:33.015
- Yeah.
- You're not supposed to.

31:33.100 --> 31:34.308
That's Montessori's revenge.

31:34.393 --> 31:35.977
- Montezuma's.
- Right.

31:36.061 --> 31:39.605
You can't even open your eyes or your mouth
when you take a shower there.

31:39.690 --> 31:42.275
Why is our water so good,
and their water is poisoned?

31:42.359 --> 31:45.361
- It's in the same ocean.
- I don't know.

31:50.033 --> 31:51.450
I'm a hippie now.

31:53.996 --> 31:55.121
Wow. Great.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.998
I've been to San Francisco,
and it's amazing there.

31:57.082 --> 32:00.626
Everybody loves everybody,
and there's so many colors.

32:00.711 --> 32:02.461
And we're gonna change the world.

32:04.548 --> 32:07.008
Will you come back there
and be my old man with me?

32:08.468 --> 32:09.927
Well, not that old.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.804
Penny, I'm a little tired now, so maybe-

32:11.888 --> 32:14.140
Wait. Wait. I got to play you this song.

32:40.667 --> 32:44.045
Penny, what did you do to my wall?

32:44.963 --> 32:47.548
Some guy called— Gold bird.

32:47.633 --> 32:51.385
Gold bird. Larry Goldberg?
You're kidding me!

32:52.429 --> 32:55.389
Hi. This is Chuck Barris
returning for Larry Goldberg.

32:56.558 --> 32:58.851
- Hi, Chuck.
- Mr. Goldberg.

32:58.935 --> 33:00.811
I'm so sorry
I didn't get back to you right away.

33:00.896 --> 33:03.022
I was out of town.
I was on vacation in Mexico.

33:03.106 --> 33:04.398
Good for you.

33:04.483 --> 33:06.442
Listen, I'm sitting here
and going through things...

33:06.526 --> 33:08.819
and I have a hole in my daytime schedule.

33:08.904 --> 33:10.946
I think it might be right
for you and your baby.

33:11.031 --> 33:12.448
My baby, Mr. Goldberg?

33:12.532 --> 33:15.868
Chuck, Dating Game.
Isn't that your baby?

33:15.952 --> 33:18.204
- Yes, sir, it is.
- You still interested?

33:18.288 --> 33:19.914
Yes, sir. Very interested, sir.

33:19.998 --> 33:23.709
I've got six weeks to get this on the air.
Is that doable for you and your people?

33:23.794 --> 33:25.461
My people?

33:25.545 --> 33:27.963
Six weeks? Sure, yeah.

33:28.048 --> 33:30.841
Give me a call when you get to LA, Chuck.

33:34.262 --> 33:35.262
Goddamn.

33:35.347 --> 33:39.725
Hot dog. Fucking shit. Piss.

33:39.810 --> 33:41.852
Who's Larry Goldberg?

33:47.818 --> 33:51.570
Bachelor number one,
what would I like most about you?

33:52.781 --> 33:57.785
I'm very romantic,
and I'd send you flowers every day.

33:57.869 --> 33:59.829
That's so sweet.

33:59.913 --> 34:02.957
Bachelor number three,
what would I like most about you?

34:04.376 --> 34:06.085
My big cock.

34:14.469 --> 34:18.431
Bachelor number one,
what nationality are you?

34:20.016 --> 34:21.641
My daddy is Welsh.

34:21.726 --> 34:23.226
My mama's Hungarian.

34:23.311 --> 34:27.148
So I guess that makes me well-hung.

34:29.943 --> 34:34.321
Bachelor number two,
I play the trombone.

34:34.406 --> 34:37.616
If I blew you, what would you sound like?

34:38.659 --> 34:40.411
What would I sound like?

34:41.705 --> 34:43.164
All right.

34:59.264 --> 35:01.599
That's nice. Don't stop.

35:08.690 --> 35:10.483
Blow it, baby.

35:20.911 --> 35:23.913
Chuck, quite frankly,
these episodes are unairable.

35:23.997 --> 35:27.166
Look, Larry, the show's spontaneous.

35:27.250 --> 35:29.877
It's unscripted. That's its charm.

35:29.961 --> 35:31.712
I can't help what people say.

35:31.797 --> 35:36.634
Be that as it may, we can't have black men
getting blowjobs on national television!

35:36.718 --> 35:38.552
The point is not that he's black, Hank.

35:38.637 --> 35:39.970
Well, I know that.

35:40.055 --> 35:42.056
Chuck, that's it.
We can't air this stuff.

35:42.140 --> 35:44.767
If you can't retain
your spontaneity on the show...

35:44.851 --> 35:46.685
without this lewd conduct, it's over.

35:46.770 --> 35:48.771
It's finished. You're history.

35:48.855 --> 35:51.357
Fix this fucking thing,
or we got a problem.

35:54.945 --> 35:56.278
Hi, folks.

35:56.363 --> 35:57.822
Before we begin taping today...

35:57.906 --> 36:02.451
I'd like to introduce you to Mr. PeterJenks
of the Federal Communications Commission.

36:02.536 --> 36:03.744
Okay?

36:07.874 --> 36:09.250
Thank you, Mr. Barris.

36:23.807 --> 36:29.395
I don't know if any of you
are aware of this...

36:31.356 --> 36:35.943
but it's a federal offense
to make lascivious remarks...

36:36.027 --> 36:38.904
on a television network broadcast.

36:42.617 --> 36:44.285
The penalty...

36:47.455 --> 36:49.290
for this disgusting...

36:52.669 --> 36:54.753
un-American...

36:54.838 --> 36:57.006
behavior...

36:57.090 --> 37:00.134
is one year in prison...

37:00.218 --> 37:02.887
or a $10,000 fine...

37:02.971 --> 37:04.763
or both!

37:07.601 --> 37:09.184
Anyone...

37:09.936 --> 37:13.939
making a sick subversive remark tonight...

37:14.024 --> 37:16.066
will be arrested immediately.

37:16.151 --> 37:19.445
I, then, will personally escort
the offender to federal prison...

37:19.529 --> 37:22.364
for booking under edict number 364...

37:22.449 --> 37:25.868
of the Broadcasting Act of 1963.

37:25.952 --> 37:30.706
And it's a long drive to that prison, baby.

37:30.790 --> 37:32.958
Just you and me.

37:33.710 --> 37:35.920
No witnesses!

37:53.188 --> 37:56.607
Okay, have fun, everybody.
All right.

37:56.691 --> 37:59.568
They gave everybodyjackets
with their names on them...

37:59.653 --> 38:02.738
and when we got number-one ratings
on Saturday nights...

38:02.822 --> 38:04.448
everybody got a gold plaque.

38:04.532 --> 38:08.869
And so, he was a good boss
and obviously had the common touch...

38:08.954 --> 38:12.206
because he really knew
what people wanted to watch.

38:13.291 --> 38:17.252
We aired and became a big hit.
A phenomenon, really.

38:17.337 --> 38:18.963
Hey, baby.

38:20.090 --> 38:22.257
I got a story to tell you.

38:22.342 --> 38:24.051
- Asshole.
- I know, I know.

38:25.720 --> 38:27.388
- I got a little story for you.
- I'm busy.

38:27.472 --> 38:29.723
We're in the middle
of a bachelorette crisis out there.

38:29.808 --> 38:31.266
Sit down. Relax.

38:31.351 --> 38:35.312
Take a load off. Make yourself at home.
I just got a call from the network.

38:35.397 --> 38:37.064
- You want a drink?
- You got any weed?

38:37.148 --> 38:39.858
I wish. No, no weed.

38:39.943 --> 38:41.193
Then I'll have a drink.

38:42.278 --> 38:43.612
Bad news?

38:43.697 --> 38:46.073
The Tammy Grimes Show
is being pulled from Saturday night.

38:46.157 --> 38:48.325
Not Tammy.

38:49.369 --> 38:52.871
They want me to put a prime-time version
of The Dating Game on in its place.

38:54.874 --> 38:57.126
- That's fucking great.
- Yeah, it's great.

38:57.210 --> 38:58.794
But they say the daytime version
is not hot enough.

38:58.878 --> 39:00.713
They want me to make it
more exciting for nighttime.

39:00.797 --> 39:02.715
I got 48 hours.

39:05.218 --> 39:06.719
What have you got?

39:07.971 --> 39:10.639
I don't have a clue.
I got nothing. I got bupkus.

39:10.724 --> 39:13.809
This is a big deal, Loretta.
This could be my big break.

39:13.893 --> 39:15.561
I know.

39:18.815 --> 39:21.734
- Don't blow it.
- Thanks for the help.

39:43.923 --> 39:45.507
Let me ask you something, Chuck.

39:45.592 --> 39:48.343
Jesus. What are you doing here?

39:48.428 --> 39:51.805
I've been put in charge
of a fairly large wet operation...

39:51.890 --> 39:53.724
and I could use your help.

39:57.937 --> 39:59.605
Have you noticed, Jim?
I got a TV show on the air.

39:59.689 --> 40:01.356
I don't need to kill people for hire anymore.

40:01.441 --> 40:04.485
I know you don't need to, but you like to.

40:04.569 --> 40:05.944
Bullshit.

40:06.029 --> 40:09.323
Think of it as a hobby...
something you do to relax.

40:09.407 --> 40:13.452
You can be an assassination enthusiast,
a murder bug.

40:13.536 --> 40:16.455
I got important things to think about here.
I don't have time to fuck around with you.

40:16.539 --> 40:20.709
This is serious work we're talking
about, Chuck— serious work.

40:20.794 --> 40:23.170
How about I help you out
with your little show...

40:23.254 --> 40:24.838
you help me out with my little operation?

40:24.923 --> 40:26.632
Tit for tat. That's the kind of guy I am.

40:26.716 --> 40:29.009
Oh, yeah. You're a piece of work.

40:29.094 --> 40:32.137
I've seen this Dating Game of yours, Chuck,
and I do have a thought.

40:33.139 --> 40:35.015
What, now you're a big television producer?

40:35.100 --> 40:37.434
I'm John Q. Public when it comes to TV...

40:37.519 --> 40:40.187
and that should make my opinion
ofvalue to you.

40:40.814 --> 40:43.816
- All right, let's hear it, then.
- All right.

40:44.609 --> 40:48.695
Some couple gets sent
to some second-rate shit-can restaurant...

40:48.780 --> 40:50.405
setting you back 50 bucks?

40:50.490 --> 40:54.576
That's not too exciting a prize
for us vicarious living boobs out in TV land.

40:54.661 --> 40:57.079
- What's your point?
- Up the stakes, Chuck.

40:57.163 --> 41:02.626
Send them to some exotic locale...
Europe, Southeast Asia, for example.

41:04.087 --> 41:07.214
The network's not going to let me send
two unmarried kids on vacation together.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.299
Send them with a chaperone.

41:12.345 --> 41:13.804
That's...

41:18.476 --> 41:21.270
- That's not half bad.
- I'm telling you.

41:21.354 --> 41:24.106
Sometimes you could be the chaperone.

41:24.190 --> 41:26.483
Say we have a job for you in Austria.

41:26.568 --> 41:30.779
You, a successful television producer
chaperones a young couple.

41:30.864 --> 41:33.490
While there, you take care
of some company business.

41:33.575 --> 41:34.992
It's a perfect cover.

41:35.076 --> 41:38.328
TV producer by day, CIA operative at night.

41:38.413 --> 41:42.249
I got money, Jim.
I don't have to kill people for money anymore.

41:42.333 --> 41:44.126
Chuck, when I said you fit the profile...

41:44.210 --> 41:47.045
very little of that meant
you needed the money.

41:47.130 --> 41:49.965
You liked it with Renda.
I saw it in your eyes.

41:51.009 --> 41:53.343
You liked it, but you botched it.

41:56.014 --> 41:58.640
You could be a great warrior, Chuck.

41:58.725 --> 42:02.144
Bachelor number three,
if we were fixed up on a date...

42:02.228 --> 42:04.813
and I ignored you,
what would you do to win my affection?

42:04.898 --> 42:07.900
This guy's never been on a date.
Ready, four. Take four.

42:07.984 --> 42:12.279
Well, I'm not used to being ignored,
but I would give you your space.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.032
The only date this guy's had
is with his right hand.

42:17.493 --> 42:18.827
Ready, one. Take one.

42:21.122 --> 42:24.708
Bachelor number three, what if I pick you...

42:24.792 --> 42:27.336
God, she's going for the three.

42:27.420 --> 42:29.004
Ready, four. Take four.

42:29.088 --> 42:34.176
The only way that you could be ugly
is by what you say or do.

42:34.260 --> 42:36.762
I don't know. From where I'm sitting,
I think you're beautiful.

42:36.846 --> 42:38.138
I can't believe it.

42:38.223 --> 42:39.598
Bachelor number three...

42:39.682 --> 42:43.018
can you please tell me what a girl is like
who has never been on a date before...

42:43.102 --> 42:44.728
and how you can tell?

42:45.813 --> 42:50.484
Wel, I'll ask her what she likes to do...

42:50.568 --> 42:53.737
and if she doesn't know
what she likes to do...

42:53.821 --> 42:55.906
then I'll know she hasn't done it yet.

43:09.379 --> 43:11.421
Why don't you talk to her?

43:11.506 --> 43:12.965
You can do that.

43:13.633 --> 43:16.051
She's real shy.

43:16.135 --> 43:18.762
You have to tell her. That's yourjob.

43:18.846 --> 43:23.809
Tell her that that I think she's real pretty
and I want to be her boyfriend.

43:25.311 --> 43:29.147
I'm shy too.
You got to tell her that, Chuck.

43:29.232 --> 43:30.607
I used to skate when I was young.

43:30.692 --> 43:32.901
I told her that. She didn't even look at me.

43:32.986 --> 43:35.570
You got to talk to her, Chuck. It's yourjob.

43:35.655 --> 43:38.824
She picked me.
She didn't pick those other guys.

43:39.534 --> 43:41.326
You're the chaperone, Chuck.

43:45.665 --> 43:47.082
She called me gay.

43:47.166 --> 43:50.419
I'm not gay. You got to tell her that.

43:50.503 --> 43:52.671
You're not doing yourjob very well.

43:52.755 --> 43:55.674
I know it takes time
for people to get to know each other...

43:55.758 --> 43:58.260
but this is ridiculous.

43:58.344 --> 44:00.721
They thought he was-

44:01.639 --> 44:05.517
They sort of walked a straight line,
because they used to talk about him...

44:05.601 --> 44:07.936
saying, you know,
"This guy, he can turn on you."

44:08.021 --> 44:10.147
And I never saw that side...

44:10.231 --> 44:13.734
but a lot of the crew
thought he could turn on them.

44:14.485 --> 44:15.777
Chuck?

44:19.824 --> 44:23.702
Helsinki is wonderful this time of year.

44:24.370 --> 44:26.163
Especially the snow.

44:27.081 --> 44:31.793
It affords one solitude
even in a city full of people.

44:45.058 --> 44:47.976
Excuse me. Is this seat taken?

44:49.062 --> 44:50.562
By you.

44:57.236 --> 45:00.947
Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?

45:01.032 --> 45:02.741
Yes, it is.

45:10.541 --> 45:12.167
I'm sorry.

45:22.387 --> 45:23.762
Excuse me.

45:36.317 --> 45:40.362
Helsinki is wonderful
this time of year, isn't it?

45:40.446 --> 45:42.572
Especially the snow.

45:42.657 --> 45:45.659
It affords one solitude
even in a city full of people.

45:45.743 --> 45:47.244
Hey.

45:49.622 --> 45:51.665
I'm Chuck.

45:52.834 --> 45:54.543
So I gathered.

45:54.627 --> 45:56.128
And you are?

45:58.131 --> 45:59.798
Here you are, Chuck.

46:02.301 --> 46:06.972
At least give me a made-up name,
something for me to cry out...

46:07.056 --> 46:09.933
during those dark nights of the soul.

46:13.813 --> 46:15.856
Cry out, "Olivia."

46:17.066 --> 46:19.359
That's Twelfth Night.

46:19.444 --> 46:21.695
Very good, Chuck.

46:21.779 --> 46:23.822
I'm pleasantly surprised.

46:24.740 --> 46:27.284
You're not like the other murderers.

46:44.343 --> 46:45.844
Here.

46:46.512 --> 46:47.846
Do you have it?

46:47.930 --> 46:50.807
- Do you have it?
- Sorry.

46:56.314 --> 46:57.731
Don't worry.
We're not going to cheat you.

46:57.815 --> 46:59.691
Yeah, just the same.

47:00.526 --> 47:02.444
Sorry about your teeth.

47:16.918 --> 47:24.257
Chuck?

48:07.134 --> 48:08.760
Olivia?

48:13.391 --> 48:15.517
It's Patricia, actually.

48:16.769 --> 48:21.064
Then I spent a year in Operation: Chaos
inside the antiwar movement...

48:21.148 --> 48:24.401
nudging it towards violence to discredit it.

48:24.485 --> 48:25.694
That was fun.

48:25.778 --> 48:28.321
It sounds fun. It sounds fun.

48:29.240 --> 48:33.618
So, tell me, Patricia,
why did you come up here tonight?

48:36.372 --> 48:38.123
I don't know.

48:38.958 --> 48:43.086
You're kind of cute
in a homely sort of way, and-

48:45.464 --> 48:47.591
It's lonely when
the civilian you're fucking...

48:47.675 --> 48:50.302
calls out the name on your fake passport.

48:50.386 --> 48:55.640
All the information I have about myself
is from forged documents.

48:58.352 --> 48:59.811
Nabokov.

49:32.845 --> 49:34.095
Wait, wait.

49:34.180 --> 49:37.265
I got to go into the bathroom
and take care of something.

49:39.018 --> 49:41.102
Leave the microfilm in, baby.

49:50.029 --> 49:51.029
Chuck!

49:54.700 --> 49:58.453
Do you know when my episode is going to air?

49:58.537 --> 50:02.248
Okay. See you, Chuck. Bye.

50:02.333 --> 50:04.125
- Chuck, this is Simon Oliver.
- Hey.

50:04.210 --> 50:06.878
Everything go okay? You don't look too good.

50:06.962 --> 50:10.298
Mr. Barris, do not ever again
jeopardize one of my missions...

50:10.383 --> 50:13.134
by having a game show contestant
standing around as a witness.

50:13.219 --> 50:15.136
- Is that understood?
- You're welcome, pal.

50:15.221 --> 50:18.515
- Do I make myself clear?
- Fuck you. They're my contestants.

50:18.599 --> 50:20.350
You are a bloody amateur.

50:20.434 --> 50:22.060
- You're a faggot.
- Chuck.

50:23.062 --> 50:25.897
Tell me, Mr. Barris.
Are you in possession of my microfilm?

50:25.981 --> 50:28.024
- Yeah, I got it.
- Let's have it.

50:28.109 --> 50:30.860
It's up my ass, Oliver. Why don't you get it?

50:30.945 --> 50:32.696
What is this shit?

50:32.780 --> 50:36.491
I deserve a little appreciation
for my efforts here, Jim.

50:36.575 --> 50:39.327
What do you think Patricia Watson was?

50:44.667 --> 50:46.418
Prick.

50:47.044 --> 50:48.461
Really? Okay.

50:48.546 --> 50:50.547
He said he dated none of them. That's right.

50:54.719 --> 50:57.220
- Sandra?
- Six of them.

50:57.304 --> 50:58.847
Six of them.

50:58.931 --> 51:01.015
Well, if it isn't the hit man.

51:01.100 --> 51:04.728
- What?
- The hit man.

51:04.812 --> 51:07.021
Surprise!

51:09.442 --> 51:12.360
ABC's going to pick up The Newlywed Game!
Daytime and prime time!

51:12.445 --> 51:13.737
You're kidding me! Oh, my God!

51:13.821 --> 51:16.948
That's sensational. You mean it? Fantastic!

51:19.160 --> 51:21.202
Here's the last
of our five-point questions.

51:21.287 --> 51:25.457
Girls, tell me where, specifically,
is the weirdest place...

51:25.541 --> 51:30.462
that you personally, girls,
have ever gotten the urge to make whoopee.

51:31.172 --> 51:34.257
The weirdest place. Olga?

51:40.306 --> 51:41.931
Yes, Olga?

51:43.309 --> 51:45.059
In the ass?

51:47.146 --> 51:49.731
No, no. No, the...

51:49.815 --> 51:50.982
It's still there.

51:51.066 --> 51:54.402
What I'm talking about is
the weirdest location, the weirdest place.

51:54.487 --> 51:55.904
The weirdest location.

51:55.988 --> 51:57.739
I don't know.

52:06.123 --> 52:07.624
Olga.

52:08.959 --> 52:11.127
Olga, the weirdest...
The location or place.

52:11.212 --> 52:12.378
You know what I mean?

53:03.931 --> 53:05.390
I liked Penny.

53:05.474 --> 53:07.976
I even loved her, in my way.

53:08.060 --> 53:12.564
But the idea of tying myself down
for the rest of my life...

53:14.191 --> 53:17.193
I remember my parents' marriage.

53:17.278 --> 53:19.070
We need a new icebox.

53:46.765 --> 53:49.017
The Newlywed Game
was based on my theory...

53:49.101 --> 53:52.270
that almost any American
would sell out their spouse...

53:52.354 --> 53:56.024
for a washer, dryer
or a lawn moweryou can ride on.

53:56.108 --> 54:00.486
Such was my respect
for that most holy of unions.

54:01.780 --> 54:04.282
- "Interpet."
- Interpret.

54:05.659 --> 54:09.120
- Do you have an extra "R" I can borrow?
- I'm not going to give you a letter.

54:09.204 --> 54:11.205
You're lucky I don't make you forfeit a turn.

54:11.290 --> 54:12.999
Okay.

54:13.500 --> 54:15.001
You look cute today, Pen.

54:15.085 --> 54:18.463
I always look cute. Don't distract me.

54:21.717 --> 54:25.428
- What was I going to say?
- I don't know. What were you going to say?

54:30.559 --> 54:33.311
I think we should get married...

54:33.395 --> 54:38.066
because we've known each other forever
and we've fucked each other forever.

54:38.150 --> 54:41.861
And you think I'm cute, you just said.

54:41.946 --> 54:44.530
And you always come to me
when you're in trouble...

54:44.615 --> 54:46.991
and I'm nothing like your mother...

54:47.076 --> 54:49.035
What does that mean? What is that?

54:51.205 --> 54:52.914
I'm just kidding.

54:54.083 --> 54:56.167
Don't ask me to marry you again, okay?

55:02.341 --> 55:04.425
I couldn't breathe.

55:04.510 --> 55:06.469
I was drowning.

55:06.553 --> 55:09.931
And what the fuck did my mother
have to do with it?

55:10.015 --> 55:12.266
So I made a call.

55:33.831 --> 55:36.040
Over here, strawberry dick.

55:44.216 --> 55:45.633
How do you know those things?

55:45.718 --> 55:48.136
We know what she actually
thought it tasted like.

55:48.220 --> 55:50.138
Really? I could never find that out.

55:50.222 --> 55:53.349
That's on a need-to-know basis,
my friend.

55:53.434 --> 55:55.268
What can I do for you?

55:55.352 --> 55:57.270
I really need something, Jim.

55:57.354 --> 55:59.313
I need something for my head.

56:03.944 --> 56:05.737
I got something for your head.

56:08.907 --> 56:14.829
And you're going on your date
to fabulous West Berlin, Germany.

56:37.770 --> 56:39.812
The name's Hans Colbert.

56:39.897 --> 56:41.856
Other side of the wall.

56:41.940 --> 56:43.983
We don't like him very much.

56:45.277 --> 56:48.613
You'll be working with a kraut named Keeler.
He's been tailing Colbert for a month.

56:48.697 --> 56:49.864
Knows the routine.

56:49.948 --> 56:53.785
Keeler's a drunk,
so stay sober and take charge.

56:54.620 --> 56:56.746
It's done and done.

56:59.458 --> 57:01.292
Kill for me, baby.

58:33.719 --> 58:35.761
What are you writing, Sieg?

58:39.766 --> 58:44.896
Just keeping track of anything
that happens in the Clara-Zetkin-Strasse.

59:09.296 --> 59:10.755
That's him.

59:13.091 --> 59:15.259
Too many people.

59:39.451 --> 59:42.203
Chuck. Chuck.

59:42.287 --> 59:44.205
- All right.
- Take the camera.

59:45.415 --> 59:47.250
What is this?

59:49.628 --> 59:50.753
What the—

59:56.969 --> 59:59.470
- Take a picture.
- Take a what?

59:59.554 --> 01:00:00.763
Take a picture.

01:00:02.808 --> 01:00:05.476
Picture. Come on.

01:00:05.560 --> 01:00:07.270
Take a picture.

01:01:33.398 --> 01:01:36.734
He would disappear
for a week or so at a time...

01:01:36.818 --> 01:01:38.736
and his secretary would
just say he's out of town.

01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:40.738
We didn't know where he went, so-

01:01:40.822 --> 01:01:43.240
I don't know whether it's true or not.

01:01:43.325 --> 01:01:45.076
I couldn't say.

01:02:03.762 --> 01:02:06.347
The only reason the KGB didn't kill me...

01:02:06.431 --> 01:02:10.935
was they needed me
to trade for one of their Russian agents.

01:02:23.657 --> 01:02:28.702
I promised myself if I got out of this,
I'd live my life differently.

01:02:28.787 --> 01:02:32.873
I'd throw myself into work, into life.

01:02:32.958 --> 01:02:34.542
Penny.

01:02:34.626 --> 01:02:37.169
I needed to see Penny again.

01:02:37.838 --> 01:02:40.798
And tell Byrd I'm out for good.

01:02:43.135 --> 01:02:46.762
If I could just make it past
this one last man—

01:02:46.847 --> 01:02:50.599
this one last...

01:03:08.493 --> 01:03:10.911
I don't know what was worse...

01:03:10.996 --> 01:03:15.416
that I was duped
by that fat fucking bachelor...

01:03:15.500 --> 01:03:19.128
or that it took seven of us to replace him.

01:03:26.511 --> 01:03:30.055
- You're still in one piece?
- Where the fuck you been?

01:03:30.140 --> 01:03:32.766
- Did you have a nice flight?
- Fuck you! Where you been?

01:03:32.851 --> 01:03:36.061
I got one contact, Jim, and it's you,
and if you disappear, I got no one.

01:03:36.146 --> 01:03:37.480
You understand?

01:04:10.180 --> 01:04:12.973
If I had a hammer

01:04:13.058 --> 01:04:15.851
I'd a-hammer in the morning

01:04:15.936 --> 01:04:18.020
I'd a-hammer in the evening

01:04:18.104 --> 01:04:21.690
- She's good, huh?
- She's very good. Very good.

01:04:21.775 --> 01:04:23.150
That's great.

01:04:23.235 --> 01:04:24.652
That's fine. Thank you so much.

01:04:24.736 --> 01:04:26.445
But I can sing the whole song.

01:04:26.530 --> 01:04:27.863
That was wonderful. Great.

01:04:27.948 --> 01:04:29.698
That was enough. That was fine.

01:04:29.783 --> 01:04:32.618
- All right. Bring in the next thing.
- That was lovely. Thank you.

01:04:32.702 --> 01:04:35.204
Christ, there's gotta be somebody
in America with some talent.

01:04:35.288 --> 01:04:37.581
- Hello.
- Good morning.

01:04:38.750 --> 01:04:41.627
I saw her in a little club in Westwood.

01:04:41.711 --> 01:04:43.420
You're gonna love her.

01:04:47.717 --> 01:04:50.553
If I had a hammer

01:04:50.637 --> 01:04:53.931
I'd hammer in the morning

01:04:54.015 --> 01:04:57.226
I'd hammer in the evening

01:04:57.310 --> 01:05:00.354
All over this land

01:05:00.438 --> 01:05:04.024
I'd hammer out danger

01:05:04.109 --> 01:05:07.027
I'd hammer out a warning

01:05:07.112 --> 01:05:10.489
I'd hammer out love between

01:05:10.574 --> 01:05:13.033
My brothers and my sisters

01:05:13.118 --> 01:05:26.714
All over this land

01:05:27.632 --> 01:05:28.882
If I were a—

01:05:28.967 --> 01:05:32.469
- No, thank you.
- That's great. Fantastic!

01:05:34.973 --> 01:05:37.558
That was great. We'll be in touch.

01:05:37.642 --> 01:05:38.892
Thank you. Thank you.

01:05:38.977 --> 01:05:40.894
We've been going about this all wrong.

01:05:40.979 --> 01:05:43.063
Rather than killing ourselves
trying to find good acts...

01:05:43.148 --> 01:05:45.065
we just put bad ones and kill them.

01:05:45.150 --> 01:05:48.068
Chuck, honestly, this—
and I know you like them— this is torture.

01:05:48.153 --> 01:05:50.487
No, no. We kill 'em before they're through.

01:05:50.572 --> 01:05:54.074
As soon as it gets unbearable,
we kill 'em dead!

01:05:57.245 --> 01:05:59.913
Ladies and gentlemen, this act-

01:05:59.998 --> 01:06:03.167
This is so good! I love this, man.

01:06:03.251 --> 01:06:06.837
This next act answers the age-old question:

01:06:07.756 --> 01:06:10.549
If you wear a cellophane... If you-

01:06:12.135 --> 01:06:16.972
Okay. If you wear a cellophane suit...

01:06:17.057 --> 01:06:20.517
can people clearly see you're nuts?

01:06:20.602 --> 01:06:23.520
I don't know. A little humor, folks.

01:06:23.605 --> 01:06:26.148
All the way from Pacoima...

01:06:26.232 --> 01:06:28.233
Mick Donnelly!

01:06:32.697 --> 01:06:36.200
Raindrops keep falling on my head

01:06:36.284 --> 01:06:40.954
Just like the guy
whose feet are too big for his bed

01:06:41.039 --> 01:06:43.624
Nothin' seems to fit, those

01:06:43.708 --> 01:06:45.626
Raindrops are fallin' on my head

01:06:45.710 --> 01:06:47.878
They keep fallin'

01:06:47.962 --> 01:06:52.549
So I just did me some talkin' to the sun

01:06:52.634 --> 01:06:57.137
And I said I didn't like
the way he got things done

01:06:57.222 --> 01:07:00.307
Sleepin' on the job, those...

01:07:00.392 --> 01:07:02.976
Who could have known
there were so many Americans...

01:07:03.061 --> 01:07:06.063
just waiting for
the opportunity to get on TV...

01:07:06.147 --> 01:07:09.024
and make an ass out of themselves?

01:07:09.109 --> 01:07:10.693
Raindrops keep fallin' on my head

01:07:10.777 --> 01:07:15.656
But that doesn't mean my eyes
will soon be turnin' red

01:07:15.740 --> 01:07:17.991
Cryin's not for me, 'cause

01:07:18.076 --> 01:07:22.162
I'm never gonna stop
the rain by complainin'

01:07:22.247 --> 01:07:23.914
Because I'm—

01:07:26.584 --> 01:07:31.171
We'll be back with more stuff...

01:07:31.256 --> 01:07:33.340
right after this message.

01:07:36.845 --> 01:07:38.887
You know what the sad part about it is...

01:07:38.972 --> 01:07:42.391
Barris has a reputation
for lowering the bar of television...

01:07:42.475 --> 01:07:44.351
and the standards and all...

01:07:44.436 --> 01:07:46.687
but he had a great feel
for what people wanted...

01:07:46.771 --> 01:07:48.939
and he couldn't take the criticism.

01:07:49.023 --> 01:07:52.568
Things started
to evolve pretty quickly.

01:07:52.652 --> 01:07:54.945
The show was gaining momentum...

01:07:55.029 --> 01:08:00.534
and I was becoming the one thing
I didn't expect... famous.

01:08:00.618 --> 01:08:03.203
- You're Chuck Barris, right?
- Yeah.

01:08:03.288 --> 01:08:05.122
The Gong Show. I love that show.

01:08:05.206 --> 01:08:06.749
Thanks.

01:09:07.018 --> 01:09:09.770
Hi.

01:09:09.854 --> 01:09:11.688
I thought that was you.

01:09:11.773 --> 01:09:15.399
Yeah. It's me.

01:09:17.779 --> 01:09:21.198
Well, I'm glad to meet you.
I've seen The Gong Show.

01:09:21.282 --> 01:09:23.200
Yeah, well-

01:09:24.493 --> 01:09:28.497
I think you're the most insidious,
despicable force in entertainment today.

01:09:30.875 --> 01:09:35.921
How dare you subject the rest of the world
to your loathsome views of humanity.

01:09:36.005 --> 01:09:37.840
Yeah, I don't think it's that loathsome.

01:09:37.924 --> 01:09:39.841
What is it, then?

01:09:39.926 --> 01:09:41.510
To mock some poor lonely people...

01:09:41.594 --> 01:09:45.555
who are just craving a little attention
in their lives to destroy them?

01:09:46.349 --> 01:09:48.475
They're still people.

01:09:48.560 --> 01:09:51.478
They still deserve
a little respect and compassion.

01:09:53.398 --> 01:09:54.940
Who the hell are you...

01:09:55.024 --> 01:09:59.570
and what the fuck have you ever done
to elevate yourself among the pathetic masses?

01:10:01.114 --> 01:10:03.949
Oh, that's right.
You created The Dating Game.

01:10:04.033 --> 01:10:05.409
Wow.

01:10:06.995 --> 01:10:09.621
That's right up there with the Sistine Chapel.

01:10:14.919 --> 01:10:18.589
Ladies and gentlemen,
it wouldn't surprise me to see this next act-

01:10:21.467 --> 01:10:23.218
That means...

01:10:23.303 --> 01:10:27.931
it's Gene Gene, the Dancing Machine...

01:10:28.016 --> 01:10:31.101
and just in time!

01:10:54.042 --> 01:10:57.669
He represents more
than just the decline of quality television.

01:10:57.754 --> 01:11:01.548
In my opinion, Chuck Barris
will do more harm to our society...

01:11:01.633 --> 01:11:03.300
than people seem to realize.

01:11:03.384 --> 01:11:05.093
Line one's for you, Chuck.

01:11:05.178 --> 01:11:06.887
- Who is it?
- Some guy.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:09.932
He says he's a friend of yours from Berlin.

01:11:24.614 --> 01:11:25.697
Hello.

01:11:25.782 --> 01:11:27.574
Very gutsy, my neighbor.

01:11:27.659 --> 01:11:30.744
I guess you heard about Oliver.

01:11:30.828 --> 01:11:32.579
Someone changed sides.

01:11:34.499 --> 01:11:35.791
What was so urgent?

01:11:40.338 --> 01:11:42.381
I was wondering,
you wanna grab a bite?

01:11:42.465 --> 01:11:44.091
I'm in town for a day.

01:11:44.175 --> 01:11:46.593
Now, assassins don't fraternize.

01:11:46.678 --> 01:11:50.472
That Keeler was calling me
could mean it was my turn to get hit.

01:11:51.891 --> 01:11:54.851
I would take him somewhere
where I knew I would be safe.

01:11:56.854 --> 01:11:58.438
How's show biz?

01:11:58.523 --> 01:12:00.273
Well, it's hit-and-miss.

01:12:00.358 --> 01:12:03.193
I got a new show called
Operation: Entertainment...

01:12:03.277 --> 01:12:05.696
which I believe is really, really gonna kill.

01:12:05.780 --> 01:12:10.075
It's sort of a Bob Hope
visiting the troops thing, but it's weekly.

01:12:10.159 --> 01:12:12.244
Instead of Bob Hope, it's like Flip Wilson.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.538
Chuck.

01:12:14.622 --> 01:12:17.207
Why do you do what you do?

01:12:18.543 --> 01:12:24.589
I like to think that I bring
joy and laughter to millions of people.

01:12:24.674 --> 01:12:28.051
It's a very important thing, I think,
in these difficult times.

01:12:28.136 --> 01:12:32.305
I'm not saying the show is
as good as it can be yet, but-

01:12:32.390 --> 01:12:34.057
No, no.

01:12:34.142 --> 01:12:37.477
Why do we do what we do?

01:12:41.357 --> 01:12:42.482
Come on.

01:12:42.567 --> 01:12:45.986
I got my feet wet in World War II.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.696
Germany.

01:12:49.115 --> 01:12:53.243
The pleasure of killing was exhilarating.

01:12:53.327 --> 01:12:59.750
Later in life,
I couldn't find a place to fill that void...

01:13:00.334 --> 01:13:03.670
to get that same rush of energy.

01:13:03.755 --> 01:13:06.089
So I started up my own business.

01:13:06.174 --> 01:13:08.925
Gentlemen, are you ready to order?

01:13:09.594 --> 01:13:11.928
I'll have a green salad, no dressing.

01:13:12.013 --> 01:13:13.513
And for you, sir?

01:13:13.598 --> 01:13:15.557
Can I get a steak? Rare.

01:13:15.641 --> 01:13:16.975
Thank you.

01:13:19.479 --> 01:13:21.772
Let me read you something.

01:13:22.899 --> 01:13:28.236
"Whatsoever your hand finds to do,
do it gladly...

01:13:28.321 --> 01:13:32.240
because there is no work, love, knowledge...

01:13:32.325 --> 01:13:34.367
or wisdom in the grave."

01:13:34.452 --> 01:13:36.578
Who is that, Carlyle?

01:13:36.662 --> 01:13:40.957
No, it's the Old Testament.

01:13:42.710 --> 01:13:44.127
It's God.

01:13:44.212 --> 01:13:47.964
It's amazing you should quote him.
He's my hero.

01:13:52.303 --> 01:13:56.139
Killing my first man...

01:13:57.892 --> 01:14:01.269
was like making love to my first woman.

01:14:02.772 --> 01:14:07.109
I remember every little detail-

01:14:07.193 --> 01:14:09.778
the smell of his hair...

01:14:09.862 --> 01:14:12.364
ice on the window...

01:14:12.448 --> 01:14:14.449
wallpaper.

01:14:16.035 --> 01:14:19.538
It's like entering a different time zone.

01:14:19.622 --> 01:14:22.707
You're becoming an outsider...

01:14:22.792 --> 01:14:25.210
isolating yourself.

01:14:25.294 --> 01:14:27.963
You're condemned.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:30.298
Condemned?

01:14:30.383 --> 01:14:33.385
You have become...

01:14:33.469 --> 01:14:37.639
their sadness...

01:14:37.723 --> 01:14:40.058
and live in a different state of mind.

01:14:44.689 --> 01:14:49.317
Ladies and gentlemen,
the host of The Gong Show...

01:14:50.820 --> 01:14:52.028
Chuck Barris.

01:14:52.113 --> 01:14:54.447
It's good to see you, Sieg.

01:14:54.532 --> 01:14:57.200
Yeah. It'll be all right.

01:14:58.995 --> 01:15:00.287
It'll be all right.

01:15:00.371 --> 01:15:01.955
Happy birthday

01:15:02.039 --> 01:15:03.331
I think.

01:15:03.416 --> 01:15:05.167
To you

01:15:05.251 --> 01:15:07.627
Happy birthday

01:15:07.712 --> 01:15:10.630
Dear Chuckie

01:15:10.715 --> 01:15:13.133
Happy birthday

01:15:13.217 --> 01:15:15.385
To you

01:15:21.934 --> 01:15:23.643
Is that right?

01:15:23.728 --> 01:15:27.272
Yeah. That's real good.

01:15:27.356 --> 01:15:29.065
That's real good.

01:15:29.150 --> 01:15:31.610
So what's wrong, Chuck?

01:15:31.861 --> 01:15:33.904
- Are you okay?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

01:15:35.740 --> 01:15:39.409
A guy I know killed himself last night.

01:15:49.420 --> 01:15:51.546
A guy I know killed himself.

01:15:58.804 --> 01:16:01.556
- Who was he?
- You don't know him.

01:16:01.641 --> 01:16:04.392
He's a stagehand.

01:16:06.437 --> 01:16:07.979
Why did he do it?

01:16:10.775 --> 01:16:13.360
He didn't like his work anymore.

01:16:13.444 --> 01:16:15.528
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

01:16:15.613 --> 01:16:18.156
Is being a stagehand really, really bad?

01:16:18.241 --> 01:16:20.283
Yeah, it's pretty bad.

01:16:35.633 --> 01:16:36.841
Hello?

01:16:37.635 --> 01:16:40.178
You were supposed to meet me
at the Palm two hours ago.

01:16:40.263 --> 01:16:42.389
- Fuck, I forgot.
- You forgot. Really?

01:16:42.473 --> 01:16:45.225
- Keeler's dead. Did you know?
- Yeah, I heard.

01:16:45.309 --> 01:16:48.061
- What did you hear?
- I heard he took himself out.

01:16:48.145 --> 01:16:49.980
Is that right? Did Byrd tell you that?

01:16:50.064 --> 01:16:52.732
He said he was depressed.
I was gonna tell you, but— Hey!

01:16:52.817 --> 01:16:54.025
Who is this?

01:16:54.110 --> 01:16:56.820
- I don't get stood up. Do you understand?
- Fun! Excuse me.

01:16:59.782 --> 01:17:02.909
So glad— Penny. Patricia.
How'd you find me?

01:17:02.994 --> 01:17:05.745
Are you serious?
This is what I do for a living.

01:17:05.830 --> 01:17:09.165
- What does she mean?
- You're dead in my book, strawberry dick.

01:17:09.250 --> 01:17:12.294
- Strawberry dick? What's that?
- I'll see you around.

01:17:12.378 --> 01:17:15.130
Nice to meet you, Penny.
I've heard a lot about you.

01:17:15.923 --> 01:17:19.050
Why don't you stay for a cocktail?

01:17:19.135 --> 01:17:20.302
Penny-

01:17:20.386 --> 01:17:23.847
And, you know, man-

01:17:23.931 --> 01:17:27.684
I'm giving you one more chance. Get it?

01:17:29.353 --> 01:17:30.520
Fuck.

01:17:31.939 --> 01:17:33.315
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:17:39.363 --> 01:17:44.534
Wise men say

01:17:46.829 --> 01:17:52.876
Only fools rush in

01:17:55.379 --> 01:18:01.426
But I can't help

01:18:01.510 --> 01:18:05.305
Falling in love

01:18:05.389 --> 01:18:09.559
With you

01:18:11.896 --> 01:18:17.233
Take my hand

01:18:19.153 --> 01:18:24.949
Take my whole life too

01:18:27.745 --> 01:18:33.750
For I can't help

01:18:33.834 --> 01:18:38.004
Falling in love

01:18:38.089 --> 01:18:43.551
With you

01:18:43.636 --> 01:18:49.849
For I can't help

01:18:49.934 --> 01:18:54.687
Falling in love

01:18:54.772 --> 01:18:58.525
With

01:18:58.609 --> 01:19:01.277
You

01:19:05.324 --> 01:19:06.783
Thank you, ladies and gentlemen.

01:19:10.830 --> 01:19:12.330
Line one for you, Chuck.

01:19:13.916 --> 01:19:15.125
Thanks.

01:19:16.127 --> 01:19:17.335
Yeah?

01:19:17.420 --> 01:19:19.003
Keeler didn't kill himself.

01:19:19.088 --> 01:19:21.047
He was murdered. Watch your back.

01:19:24.176 --> 01:19:26.386
You can come in now, Mr. Flexner.

01:19:26.470 --> 01:19:27.387
Chuck!

01:19:28.931 --> 01:19:31.474
- Great to see ya.
- What's up, Rod?

01:19:34.687 --> 01:19:37.689
Well— Chuck, may I sit?

01:19:37.773 --> 01:19:39.399
Hey, how's that redhead?

01:19:39.483 --> 01:19:42.318
She's good, you know. Keeps...

01:19:43.070 --> 01:19:45.989
Well, Chuck, the thing is, we have to talk.

01:19:46.490 --> 01:19:47.740
What's up, Rod?

01:19:47.825 --> 01:19:50.201
Well, the thing is...

01:19:51.662 --> 01:19:55.248
some of your old shows aren't doing so well
in the old ratings war.

01:19:57.418 --> 01:20:01.463
So I've been put
in the unfortunate position...

01:20:01.547 --> 01:20:06.926
of having to inform you
that the network is canceling these shows.

01:20:10.014 --> 01:20:11.890
Now, don't shoot me, Chuck.

01:20:13.142 --> 01:20:15.226
I'm just the messenger.

01:20:31.327 --> 01:20:34.496
This really is the hardest part
of the job for me.

01:20:36.081 --> 01:20:37.707
They killed my babies...

01:20:37.791 --> 01:20:38.958
just like that.

01:20:39.043 --> 01:20:44.214
I pushed them into the world
through the birth canal of my imagination...

01:20:44.298 --> 01:20:47.133
Iovingly, tenderly.

01:20:47.218 --> 01:20:49.552
Where's the humanity of these people?

01:20:51.180 --> 01:20:53.765
- Fuck 'em.
- Fuck 'em.

01:20:53.849 --> 01:20:55.767
They're fucking bastards anyway.

01:20:56.685 --> 01:20:58.561
Yeah. What am I gonna do now?

01:21:00.689 --> 01:21:02.649
Oh, baby.

01:21:02.733 --> 01:21:06.277
Oh, yeah. Feels so good.

01:21:27.883 --> 01:21:29.259
Chuck?

01:21:34.014 --> 01:21:35.932
- Chuck?
- Fuck! Fuck!

01:21:36.809 --> 01:21:38.476
Penny, fuck!

01:21:55.160 --> 01:21:57.495
I came here to tell you I sold a painting.

01:21:57.580 --> 01:21:59.497
That's great.

01:22:02.459 --> 01:22:03.960
What's she doing here?

01:22:04.044 --> 01:22:05.795
She's...

01:22:07.631 --> 01:22:09.716
This is our house.

01:22:10.968 --> 01:22:14.804
It's one thing to go elsewhere
for your pussy needs.

01:22:15.639 --> 01:22:18.224
But this is our house.

01:22:18.309 --> 01:22:19.892
It's my house, Pen.

01:22:19.977 --> 01:22:21.477
It's our house.

01:22:23.856 --> 01:22:26.733
I found it with you. I decorated it with you.

01:22:26.817 --> 01:22:32.071
I spent six fucking months waiting
for the fucking plumber to fucking come.

01:22:37.911 --> 01:22:39.829
I'm sorry.

01:22:42.333 --> 01:22:44.584
You're such an asshole.

01:23:29.088 --> 01:23:32.215
No, I'm not saying that.
That's not what I'm saying.

01:23:32.299 --> 01:23:34.217
Then what are you saying, Chuck?

01:23:36.845 --> 01:23:39.806
Do you want me around or not?

01:23:39.890 --> 01:23:42.225
Do you even like me?

01:23:42.309 --> 01:23:44.227
Of course I like you.

01:23:44.311 --> 01:23:45.728
Penny-

01:23:45.813 --> 01:23:48.398
- How much?
- What?

01:23:48.482 --> 01:23:51.943
I need to know how much you like me.

01:23:52.903 --> 01:23:56.239
I don't know what that means.
How much?

01:23:56.323 --> 01:23:58.741
How can I rate a person in that way?

01:23:58.826 --> 01:24:01.285
You could if you felt it.

01:24:01.370 --> 01:24:03.413
If you felt it, it would be easy.

01:24:03.497 --> 01:24:05.248
You would just...

01:24:06.750 --> 01:24:10.336
spread your arms as wide as they would go...

01:24:10.421 --> 01:24:12.922
and say, "This much, Penny."

01:24:22.766 --> 01:24:24.350
Everything—

01:24:24.435 --> 01:24:26.644
Everything's complicated, Pen.

01:24:26.729 --> 01:24:29.814
Nothing's black and white like that.

01:24:36.447 --> 01:24:38.281
Do you want me around or not?

01:24:38.365 --> 01:24:41.743
Because if you don't, it's okay. Just tell me.

01:24:41.827 --> 01:24:43.286
Hey, hey.

01:24:46.457 --> 01:24:50.293
I love you, Penny, in my way.

01:24:56.633 --> 01:25:00.553
Maybe not in that crazy
head-over-heels thing...

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.930
but what is that anyway?

01:25:03.682 --> 01:25:05.349
Romantic love-

01:25:05.934 --> 01:25:08.811
isn't that just an illusion?

01:25:12.232 --> 01:25:15.318
You just said you loved me, right?

01:25:59.822 --> 01:26:02.490
- Hi, Chuck.
- Hey, Jim, what do you want?

01:26:02.574 --> 01:26:04.659
- How's work?
- Great.

01:26:04.743 --> 01:26:06.327
Any new game show ideas?

01:26:06.411 --> 01:26:09.038
Dozens. Why are you here, Jim?

01:26:09.957 --> 01:26:12.667
We need you to find the mole and take him out.

01:26:17.047 --> 01:26:18.464
Yeah.

01:26:21.927 --> 01:26:24.178
Yeah. I'm done killing people.

01:26:24.263 --> 01:26:26.681
I just want to entertain people.

01:26:26.765 --> 01:26:28.391
I'm out.

01:26:29.643 --> 01:26:31.561
No, you're not.

01:26:36.233 --> 01:26:38.192
Hey, I got an idea.

01:26:38.277 --> 01:26:42.697
If you want him so bad,
why don't you do it?

01:26:42.781 --> 01:26:44.699
Why don't you kill the mole?

01:26:44.783 --> 01:26:47.034
You have a problem with killing, Jim?

01:26:48.537 --> 01:26:50.580
I just don't fit the profile.

01:26:51.331 --> 01:26:54.083
What fucking profile?
There is no fucking profile.

01:26:54.167 --> 01:26:55.293
Okay. There's no profile.

01:26:55.377 --> 01:26:58.045
- There's no profile.
- Okay.

01:27:01.425 --> 01:27:05.678
You had a twin sister, stillborn,
strangled by your umbilical cord.

01:27:05.762 --> 01:27:08.264
Your first hit.

01:27:08.348 --> 01:27:10.182
Your mother always wanted a daughter.

01:27:10.267 --> 01:27:12.226
She blamed you for your sister's death...

01:27:12.311 --> 01:27:16.397
so until your sister Phoebe was born,
she raised you as a girl.

01:27:16.481 --> 01:27:17.857
What else?

01:27:17.941 --> 01:27:20.568
Your father, the dentist.

01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:23.279
Not really your father.

01:27:24.072 --> 01:27:27.700
Your real father was a man
named Edmond James Windsor.

01:27:28.577 --> 01:27:31.746
Among other things, he was a serial killer,
a fact your mother didn't know...

01:27:31.830 --> 01:27:34.707
when she had an affair with him in 1928.

01:27:34.791 --> 01:27:37.043
- That's ridiculous.
- Is it?

01:27:37.127 --> 01:27:38.711
That's insane.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:42.048
Windsor died in the electric chair in 1939.

01:27:43.675 --> 01:27:46.218
I'm trying to think of
what more I can tell you...

01:27:46.303 --> 01:27:48.262
but you have me at a bit
of a disadvantage, Chuck.

01:27:48.347 --> 01:27:50.681
I don't have your files in front of me.

01:27:59.316 --> 01:28:00.900
Come on, Jim.

01:28:06.823 --> 01:28:08.324
I'm out.

01:28:15.749 --> 01:28:18.918
As long as the mole's alive,
you're a dead man.

01:28:19.586 --> 01:28:21.796
How do I know it's not you?

01:28:22.547 --> 01:28:25.007
You're a fairly bright guy, Chuck.

01:28:26.593 --> 01:28:28.594
You'll figure it out.

01:30:34.638 --> 01:30:37.139
- Hey, Chuck. I-
- Take it off.

01:30:37.224 --> 01:30:39.433
Who are you?
What's your name? What's your name?

01:30:50.904 --> 01:30:52.404
Yeah.

01:30:52.489 --> 01:30:55.658
That's the way it goes on TV.

01:30:55.742 --> 01:30:59.245
Get off the stage. Get off the stage.
Go back to Scotland!

01:30:59.329 --> 01:31:03.040
Get yourself a Guinness and some Lucky Charms.

01:31:03.125 --> 01:31:04.041
All right.

01:31:04.876 --> 01:31:08.796
Ladies and gentlemen,
the prince of puns...

01:31:08.880 --> 01:31:11.924
the wizard of whoopee!

01:31:12.551 --> 01:31:14.885
The Unknown Comic!

01:31:14.970 --> 01:31:16.887
Hey, Chuckie, baby!

01:31:16.972 --> 01:31:19.056
Hey, Chuckie, baby, I got a joke for you.

01:31:19.141 --> 01:31:20.558
- Ajoke.
- What?

01:31:20.642 --> 01:31:22.726
What's the difference between toilet paper
and a shower curtain?

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:25.146
- I don't know. What?
- Here's the guy!

01:31:25.230 --> 01:31:28.274
- Get off the stage.
- No, it's my turn, Chuckie.

01:31:28.358 --> 01:31:31.318
- Get off the stage.
- You're fucking crazy, man.

01:31:31.403 --> 01:31:33.362
Get the fuck out of here.

01:31:33.446 --> 01:31:38.200
Ladies and gentlemen,
our next act—

01:31:40.036 --> 01:31:41.579
First came...

01:31:44.291 --> 01:31:48.002
to us... all the way...

01:31:52.048 --> 01:31:55.843
Lord. Crazy on coast-to-coast.

01:31:58.013 --> 01:31:59.430
Come on.

01:32:03.518 --> 01:32:05.728
You like the way Mommy looks?

01:32:05.812 --> 01:32:07.354
Yes.

01:32:07.439 --> 01:32:09.857
I bet you'd like to be a mommy someday,
wouldn't you?

01:32:11.234 --> 01:32:12.443
Come here, you.

01:32:20.577 --> 01:32:22.286
Sorry about your teeth.

01:32:32.255 --> 01:32:39.845
Happy birthday to you

01:32:39.930 --> 01:32:44.141
Happy birthday, dear Chuckie

01:32:44.226 --> 01:32:46.727
Happy birthday to...

01:32:58.865 --> 01:33:02.076
Come on. Take me away now.

01:33:02.786 --> 01:33:04.578
Take me away.

01:33:05.455 --> 01:33:07.498
What are you waitin' for?

01:33:07.582 --> 01:33:10.209
Come on. Come on.

01:33:10.293 --> 01:33:12.586
Come on.

01:33:14.547 --> 01:33:17.716
I see you. I know who you are.

01:33:17.801 --> 01:33:19.301
What are you looking at?

01:34:42.886 --> 01:34:44.720
Dear Penny...

01:34:44.804 --> 01:34:49.391
this isjust a note to say that I'm sorry...

01:34:49.476 --> 01:34:51.894
for all of it.

01:34:51.978 --> 01:34:54.855
You were the best part of my life...

01:34:54.939 --> 01:34:57.691
and I couldn't see it.

01:34:57.776 --> 01:35:00.110
I'm not asking for another chance...

01:35:01.571 --> 01:35:03.906
just for your forgiveness.

01:35:05.492 --> 01:35:07.117
Love, Chuck.

01:35:26.763 --> 01:35:28.680
Well...

01:35:28.765 --> 01:35:31.100
Iook who comes out of hiding.

01:35:32.477 --> 01:35:34.395
I started thinking, Trish,
you're the only woman...

01:35:34.479 --> 01:35:37.523
in the world who really knows me.

01:35:37.607 --> 01:35:42.903
I know I screwed you over in the past,
and I'm sorry.

01:35:47.117 --> 01:35:49.118
I just want you to know that...

01:35:53.289 --> 01:35:55.457
I hate myself for how...

01:35:56.334 --> 01:35:59.962
Goddamn, I hate myself for how I lived, Trish.

01:36:01.214 --> 01:36:07.052
Nietzsche says whoever despises oneself
still respects oneself as one who despises.

01:36:08.638 --> 01:36:10.556
Shit, I never thought of that.

01:36:10.640 --> 01:36:13.851
I can't even despise myself with any insight.

01:36:14.686 --> 01:36:18.981
The insane asylums are filled with people
who think they're Jesus or Satan.

01:36:19.065 --> 01:36:21.984
Very few have delusions of being...

01:36:22.068 --> 01:36:25.863
a guy down the block who works
for an insurance company.

01:36:28.283 --> 01:36:29.992
All right.

01:36:31.661 --> 01:36:34.288
What is this stuff?

01:36:34.372 --> 01:36:36.206
I wanted to be a writer once.

01:36:36.291 --> 01:36:40.711
I wanted to write something that someday
some lesser person would quote...

01:36:40.795 --> 01:36:42.254
but I never did.

01:36:42.338 --> 01:36:45.007
I'm the lesser person, Trish.

01:36:46.009 --> 01:36:49.136
I never said anything meaningful
that wasn't said by somebody else first.

01:36:49.679 --> 01:36:52.723
I am disposable.

01:36:53.558 --> 01:36:56.018
I disposed of people, and I'm disposable.

01:36:59.856 --> 01:37:03.984
I've been thinking about you
a lot lately, Chuck.

01:37:04.068 --> 01:37:05.611
Yeah?

01:37:07.113 --> 01:37:08.989
I've missed you.

01:37:09.073 --> 01:37:11.241
You could have fooled me.

01:37:11.326 --> 01:37:13.202
Well, I've mellowed.

01:37:15.288 --> 01:37:16.914
Boston is a beautiful city.

01:37:16.998 --> 01:37:21.543
We could start over here,
normal life together.

01:37:21.628 --> 01:37:23.921
Sell insurance.

01:37:26.174 --> 01:37:29.218
Yeah! That sounds good. That sounds right.

01:37:32.347 --> 01:37:33.680
Look at that.

01:37:34.807 --> 01:37:36.892
I could learn to love that skyline.

01:37:38.603 --> 01:37:41.230
Did you see I got your picture framed?

01:37:41.314 --> 01:37:42.731
Yeah? Where?

01:37:42.815 --> 01:37:45.734
- Look.
- Hot dog!

01:37:48.279 --> 01:37:53.075
To life.

01:38:04.295 --> 01:38:07.422
You devil. Isn't that sweet?

01:38:11.928 --> 01:38:15.097
Hey, what about splitting
our time in New York?

01:38:17.684 --> 01:38:21.270
Fuck. I just bit— It's just a-

01:38:38.288 --> 01:38:40.038
No, that's too quick.

01:38:40.123 --> 01:38:43.375
You're supposed to get to
the bathroom and throw up first.

01:38:44.127 --> 01:38:46.628
God, Chuck, you should have
seen Oliver's face.

01:38:46.713 --> 01:38:50.382
It was just— Well, if I do say so myself.

01:38:50.466 --> 01:38:52.884
I got a nice snapshot of it, actually.

01:38:54.345 --> 01:38:55.804
Keeler was easy.

01:38:55.888 --> 01:38:59.474
Traveled halfway around
the world for a night with me.

01:39:03.479 --> 01:39:06.857
Okay. Let's see.

01:39:06.941 --> 01:39:10.819
Chuck, you've put on weight.

01:39:12.822 --> 01:39:14.323
Come on.

01:39:15.074 --> 01:39:16.658
I nearly blew it with Byrd.

01:39:17.869 --> 01:39:20.370
Never farm out a job
that you should do yourself.

01:39:20.455 --> 01:39:24.333
Do you want a laugh?
He thought you were the mole.

01:39:25.001 --> 01:39:27.753
He was going to kill you. What an idiot.

01:39:29.213 --> 01:39:32.674
"I'm not at all the person
you and I took me for."

01:39:33.635 --> 01:39:36.970
Sounds like an epitaph.
Your handwriting, too.

01:39:37.055 --> 01:39:39.514
You see, Chuck, I save everything.

01:39:39.599 --> 01:39:41.600
All of your lovely notes.

01:39:44.479 --> 01:39:46.355
You know what?

01:39:48.358 --> 01:39:50.025
I like Carlyle best too.

01:39:50.109 --> 01:39:52.069
I really do. Yeah.

01:39:52.153 --> 01:39:54.404
Say hi to the boys when you see 'em.

01:41:01.431 --> 01:41:02.848
To life.

01:42:00.615 --> 01:42:04.034
My name is Charles Hirsch Barris.

01:42:04.118 --> 01:42:06.328
I have written pop songs.

01:42:07.330 --> 01:42:10.040
I have been a television producer.

01:42:10.124 --> 01:42:13.543
I am responsible for polluting the airwaves...

01:42:13.628 --> 01:42:17.923
with mind-numbing, puerile entertainment.

01:42:18.007 --> 01:42:22.552
In addition, I have murdered 33 human beings.

01:42:44.909 --> 01:42:46.576
We have come here today...

01:42:46.661 --> 01:42:52.415
to join Penny Pacino and Chuck Barris
in holy matrimony.

01:42:52.500 --> 01:42:54.876
You all know Chuck Barris...

01:42:54.961 --> 01:42:58.672
creator of
The Dating Game, The Newlywed Game...

01:42:58.756 --> 01:43:02.467
The Family Game,
The Game Game...

01:43:02.552 --> 01:43:05.011
Dream Girl of 1968...

01:43:05.096 --> 01:43:07.347
Operation: Entertainment...

01:43:07.431 --> 01:43:11.643
How's Your Mother-in-law
and many others.

01:43:11.727 --> 01:43:14.980
Chuck Barris, who most recently
brought us such hits...

01:43:15.064 --> 01:43:16.690
as The Rah-Rah Show...

01:43:16.774 --> 01:43:20.360
The $1.98 Beauty Show...

01:43:20.444 --> 01:43:22.737
The Gong Show.

01:43:24.532 --> 01:43:28.451
Chuck Barris,
who I'm sure will be back soon...

01:43:28.536 --> 01:43:33.540
with even more shows
that will stimulate and educate...

01:43:33.624 --> 01:43:36.626
and keep us on the edge of our seats.

01:44:08.743 --> 01:44:10.452
All right, all right!

01:44:11.329 --> 01:44:12.621
Congratulations!

01:44:12.705 --> 01:44:13.705
Hey!

01:44:13.789 --> 01:44:15.707
Thanks, thanks.

01:44:15.791 --> 01:44:17.000
Thanks.

01:44:40.983 --> 01:44:42.484
Danny, drive now!

01:44:45.863 --> 01:44:46.905
Bye!

01:44:46.989 --> 01:44:50.909
Penny, there's something I gotta confess,
something I gotta tell ya.

01:44:52.161 --> 01:44:54.746
Listen to me, Penny.
You've known me for a long time-

01:44:54.830 --> 01:44:59.250
As the host of The Dating Game,
The Gong Show, Rah-Rah Show—

01:44:59.335 --> 01:45:01.252
Yeah, yeah. Listen, listen.

01:45:01.337 --> 01:45:04.839
I work for the CIA.

01:45:04.924 --> 01:45:07.842
Do you understand?
And I kill people.

01:45:09.261 --> 01:45:11.513
I killed a lot of people.

01:45:11.597 --> 01:45:13.974
You understand?

01:45:15.017 --> 01:45:16.768
I killed a lot of people.

01:45:45.339 --> 01:45:49.134
I came up with
a new game show idea recently.

01:45:49.218 --> 01:45:51.386
It's called The Old Game.

01:45:52.263 --> 01:45:56.725
You got three old guys
with loaded guns on stage.

01:45:57.268 --> 01:46:00.395
They look back at their lives...

01:46:00.479 --> 01:46:05.191
see who they were,
what they accomplished...

01:46:05.276 --> 01:46:08.945
how close they came
to realizing their dreams.

01:46:12.783 --> 01:46:14.409
The winner...

01:46:15.036 --> 01:46:17.829
is the one who doesn't blow his brains out.

01:46:19.582 --> 01:46:21.750
He gets a refrigerator.
