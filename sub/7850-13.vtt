there to catch you.

All right, all right.

14:30.136 --> 14:34.007
Now all we need to do is find
the Mexican Red-Kneed Tarantula,

all of the lights in the hotel

to the room using flashlights.

-Will that work?
-CODY: Well, yes.

15:11.578 --> 15:12.779
Beetles are attracted to light.

if we imitate their mating call.
