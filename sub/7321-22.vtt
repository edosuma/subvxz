00:03.336 --> 00:07.739
You never know the biggest day
of your life is going to be the biggest.

00:09.709 --> 00:13.406
The days you think
are going to be big ones...

00:14.948 --> 00:19.078
They're never as big as you
make them out to be in your head.

00:21.187 --> 00:24.816
It's the regular days.

00:24.858 --> 00:29.761
The ones that start out normal.

00:30.697 --> 00:35.361
Those are the days
that end up being the biggest.

00:36.169 --> 00:39.502
And today was the wedding.

00:39.539 --> 00:41.734
It was beautiful.

00:43.109 --> 00:44.667
Perfect.

00:46.513 --> 00:49.914
- Just a normal day.
- Normal day.

00:51.051 --> 00:52.382
Going to work.

00:52.419 --> 00:56.879
Just a normal day that ends
in a ceremony in a churchy church.

00:56.923 --> 01:01.519
This has nothing to do with us.
We're just the bride and groom.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.825
- We're getting married tonight.
- We're getting married tonight.

01:17.243 --> 01:18.710
You slept here?

01:18.778 --> 01:22.236
- I'm awake. What?
- You slept here? I slept here.

01:22.282 --> 01:27.413
- How? Wait... Who... What?
- I slept in the on-call room.

01:29.923 --> 01:33.154
I could have been at home in my own bed.

01:33.193 --> 01:35.286
- Sorry.
- I have to work all day.

01:35.328 --> 01:39.321
Then I have to be happy maid of honor
and get Meredith down the aisle.

01:39.399 --> 01:42.334
I'm so tired. Because I slept here.

01:42.402 --> 01:45.838
'Cause you wanted to get your freak on
with roller skate girl.

01:45.905 --> 01:48.669
I'm sorry. I was gonna, but...

01:48.741 --> 01:52.507
We went to dinner and...
things didn't...

01:52.545 --> 01:55.844
I wasn't in the mood.
Had to be here early, anyway, to run ER.

01:55.882 --> 01:58.749
You're picking up extra shifts in ER?

01:58.818 --> 02:03.778
- So is Owen not here today?
- He's here. Crap, I'm late.

02:05.258 --> 02:06.316
- Hey.
- Hey.

02:07.727 --> 02:10.854
Big day! Biggest day of your life!

02:10.930 --> 02:14.331
Don't do that, the peppy
maid of honor thing. It's creepy.

02:14.367 --> 02:18.303
Really? Good. Wait.
Is this the calm before the storm?

02:18.338 --> 02:20.806
Need me to drug you?
Or shave your eyebrows

02:20.840 --> 02:23.104
- to numb you into submission?
- I'm fine.

02:23.176 --> 02:24.803
Not the biggest day of my life.

02:24.844 --> 02:27.779
Biggest day of Izzie's life.
I'm excited about the marriage,

02:27.847 --> 02:30.975
not some wedding.
She's the one who's gone Bridezilla.

02:31.017 --> 02:33.247
Bridezilla!

02:33.319 --> 02:35.810
You should see
the bridesmaids' dresses.

02:35.855 --> 02:39.757
Oh! And the flowers!
They're being delivered at 5:00.

02:39.826 --> 02:44.024
I had to pay extra to have them decorate
but Derek gave me his credit card,

02:44.063 --> 02:47.521
told me to do what I had to do so...
It's gonna be perfect.

02:47.567 --> 02:49.865
- How's her pressure?
- Within normal.

02:49.903 --> 02:51.393
And her incision site?

02:51.471 --> 02:53.735
As expected, two weeks after surgery.

02:53.806 --> 02:56.934
She got off the IL-2 hours ago.
She could still have...

02:57.010 --> 03:01.276
Her mets are gone. Her blood pressure's
fine. Her incision doesn't hurt.

03:01.347 --> 03:03.747
She's doing well.

03:03.816 --> 03:06.284
It's wedding day! And I'm going.

03:06.352 --> 03:09.412
I'm a bridesmaid. I'm going.
Right, Bailey?

03:09.455 --> 03:12.583
- I said you could go.
- Wedding day!

03:12.625 --> 03:14.684
Up top, Alex!

03:14.761 --> 03:16.388
I'll check on you later.

03:17.430 --> 03:20.024
Don't leave me hanging, Bailey.
Wedding day!

03:20.099 --> 03:22.124
Wedding day...

03:23.436 --> 03:25.370
You did that 'cause I have cancer.

03:25.438 --> 03:27.463
- You didn't mean it.
- True.

03:37.850 --> 03:40.944
My hair is starting to fall out.

03:40.987 --> 03:42.682
You still look good.

03:46.960 --> 03:48.985
I know what this means.

03:50.129 --> 03:53.257
- You being here.
- I'm sorry.

03:53.333 --> 03:55.801
I'm still going to the wedding.

04:03.509 --> 04:04.771
- How's Izzie?
- Good.

04:04.844 --> 04:08.837
BP stable? If she's hypotensive
she shouldn't go to the wedding.

04:08.881 --> 04:11.042
- Let me worry about Izzie.
- All right.

04:11.117 --> 04:12.982
Anything for us? Anything good?

04:13.019 --> 04:14.077
Nope. It's slow.

04:14.153 --> 04:16.314
You don't say
it's a slow day in the pit.

04:16.356 --> 04:17.880
Never say it's sl...

04:17.957 --> 04:20.619
- You just jinxed us.
- It's a day and it's slow.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.923
That phone starts ringing,
you're gonna

04:22.996 --> 04:25.260
- wish you hadn't said that.
- Not gonna ring. It's a slow day.

04:29.369 --> 04:32.236
Go for Seattle Grace Emergency.

04:35.908 --> 04:39.571
- I'll get the trauma gowns.
- Crap, crap, crap... Incoming!

04:48.554 --> 04:50.283
How's it going with your shrink?

04:50.323 --> 04:53.884
Uh... I'm doing better. Inch by inch.

04:55.762 --> 04:58.390
Progress is slow.

05:05.571 --> 05:09.507
It was your ceiling fan.
Above your bed?

05:09.575 --> 05:12.305
Blades spinning
like blades of a chopper.

05:12.378 --> 05:14.972
My shrink says that was the trigger.

05:15.048 --> 05:16.606
To me...

05:17.984 --> 05:19.713
...choking you.

05:22.322 --> 05:23.687
Oh.

05:31.497 --> 05:35.194
We should probably get going.

05:35.234 --> 05:39.261
David Simons, 22, in the driver's
seat when his car got crushed by a semi.

05:39.305 --> 05:41.796
Truck blew a tire
and jack-knifed across traffic.

05:41.874 --> 05:45.275
- Bay One until we get a trauma room.
- Injuries?

05:45.311 --> 05:48.405
Chest contusions.
Otherwise vital signs were stable.

05:48.448 --> 05:51.747
- We can't be late.
- Ready? One, two, three...

05:51.784 --> 05:54.412
- Late for what?
- Graduation.

05:54.454 --> 05:57.514
Becca Wells, 21-year-old,
back seat. Vitals stable.

05:57.590 --> 06:00.684
- Some shortness of breath.
- Bay Two for now.

06:00.760 --> 06:03.854
- Gonna be so worried.
- David, that you?

06:03.930 --> 06:05.989
Becca? Are you OK?

06:06.065 --> 06:10.092
- I think so. I don't know.
- One, two, three.

06:10.136 --> 06:12.604
I'm talking. Can't be too bad
if I'm talking.

06:14.340 --> 06:19.334
22 year-old passenger, tenderness
above pelvis and unstable BP...

06:19.379 --> 06:20.505
Bay Five.

06:20.546 --> 06:23.014
Is my girlfriend here?
She was in the back seat.

06:23.082 --> 06:24.743
- Jordan?
- Becca?

06:24.817 --> 06:27.547
Have you seen Dana?
You were sitting next to her.

06:27.620 --> 06:30.453
Can you check our friends?
Dana, Michelle, Pete?

06:30.490 --> 06:31.889
Eight piled into the SUV?

06:31.958 --> 06:34.825
- Are they all this bad?
- These are the healthy ones.

06:34.861 --> 06:39.821
OK. I need beds. And blood and interns.
And Owen Hunt. Where's Hunt?

06:39.866 --> 06:43.734
V- tach! BP's dropped out! Need
crash cart. I'm gonna cardiovert!

06:43.803 --> 06:45.998
David! What's wrong with him?

06:46.038 --> 06:47.903
- Charge to 100! Clear.
- David!

06:47.940 --> 06:50.408
- What's wrong with David?
- Have to save him.

06:50.476 --> 06:53.570
You can't let him die!
We're supposed to be graduating.

06:54.414 --> 06:58.248
- Charge to 200! Clear!
- This is the biggest day of our lives.

06:58.317 --> 06:59.944
Where in the hell is Hunt?

07:04.123 --> 07:07.024
Hunt, thank God.
Trauma One through Three.

07:08.895 --> 07:09.987
What do we got?

07:10.029 --> 07:14.090
Becca Wells. Respiratory rate
up 20, but vital signs stable.

07:14.167 --> 07:16.431
Is David OK? He has to graduate.

07:16.502 --> 07:18.732
He's the first
in his family to go to college.

07:18.805 --> 07:21.433
Don't worry about
your friends right now.

07:21.507 --> 07:24.408
No hemothorax or pneumothorax.
In line for CT.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.810
Gonna get a few X-rays,
get a better idea.

07:26.879 --> 07:29.439
You should rest.
Your body's in serious shock.

07:29.515 --> 07:31.745
I have a speech to give.

07:31.818 --> 07:35.584
I'm supposed to...
I'm the valedictorian.

07:35.655 --> 07:39.716
All I've ever done is school.
It's all I've ever done.

07:39.759 --> 07:43.286
I haven't done anything else.

07:45.031 --> 07:48.728
Until today. Today's the day
that my life is supposed to start.

07:48.768 --> 07:52.727
Which is why
I'd really like to live. OK?

07:52.772 --> 07:55.104
- Let me know the results of the CT.
- OK.

07:59.946 --> 08:02.176
I haven't seen Dana yet, my girlfriend.

08:02.248 --> 08:05.615
- She was in the backseat...
- Hang blood and push fluids.

08:06.519 --> 08:10.285
She was singing to the radio.
She never knows the words.

08:10.356 --> 08:13.484
I turned around to tell her and then...
she wasn't there.

08:13.559 --> 08:16.357
Calm down so we can treat you.
Very serious injuries.

08:16.429 --> 08:19.956
- She was not in the car anymore!
- I promise I will check for you.

08:20.032 --> 08:21.761
You need to stay still for me.

08:21.801 --> 08:24.201
- She's wearing a pink sweater.
- OK.

08:24.270 --> 08:27.671
Keep working. Try to get his
pressure up before you move him.

08:31.210 --> 08:34.543
Systolic's stabilizing,
but still multiple arrhythmias.

08:34.614 --> 08:36.275
Thinking cardiac contusions.

08:36.315 --> 08:39.307
- I'm about to use a chest tube.
- You got this, O'Malley.

08:40.419 --> 08:42.909
- I've got blood.
- Put it in the rapid infuser.

08:42.955 --> 08:45.515
Are my friends here? Did you see Pete?

08:45.591 --> 08:48.492
- Which one's Pete?
- He's wearing red sneakers.

08:48.561 --> 08:52.258
And Michelle, she dyed her hair
blue for graduation.

08:52.298 --> 08:56.997
- Did you see her? Is she OK?
- I'll find them.

08:57.036 --> 09:00.494
- My whole family is coming.
- I know. It's a big day.

09:01.440 --> 09:04.671
For them. Today is for them.

09:06.445 --> 09:09.209
V- fib! He's coding! Get the paddles!

09:14.954 --> 09:16.512
Page me?

09:17.290 --> 09:19.485
Yes. You get the check
for the caterers?

09:19.525 --> 09:21.516
- And cash tips for the waiters?
- Yes.

09:21.561 --> 09:24.223
- Did you write your vows?
- Not yet. I will.

09:24.297 --> 09:26.128
You have to write your vows.

09:26.165 --> 09:29.623
What you say this day, it's important.
She'll remember it for life.

09:29.669 --> 09:31.933
If you paged me
to talk about the wedding...

09:32.004 --> 09:33.665
That's not why I paged you.

09:36.609 --> 09:38.634
I have a craniotomy to get to.

09:39.478 --> 09:42.641
He's back. Denny. He's back.

09:46.419 --> 09:50.856
- I'll page Dr. Bailey and we'll...
- Order an MRl. I know the drill.

09:58.965 --> 10:00.762
You wanted to see me, chief?

10:00.833 --> 10:04.360
Derek was supposed to do this,
but he got pulled into something.

10:04.403 --> 10:06.871
- I said I'd give it to you.
- What?

10:06.906 --> 10:11.172
Your wedding present. Not from me,
from Derek. I have to oversee it.

10:11.210 --> 10:13.144
I was supposed to get him a present?

10:13.212 --> 10:17.239
This is why weddings are stupid.
Our life together should be the present.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.752
Not some stupid...
Whatever it is, I don't want it.

10:20.786 --> 10:24.722
Tell Derek to take it back.
I'll tell him.

10:24.757 --> 10:27.817
- He got you a colon.
- What?

10:27.893 --> 10:29.554
A colon.

10:29.595 --> 10:31.722
It's non-refundable, inflamed,

10:31.764 --> 10:34.426
it's about to go
under anesthesia in OR 2.

10:35.334 --> 10:37.598
You really wanna say you don't want it?

10:37.637 --> 10:39.400
A solo surgery?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.930
Happy Wedding Day.

10:45.011 --> 10:47.445
- Yes or no?
- Hey.

10:47.513 --> 10:49.777
I don't need a maybe.
I need a yes or no.

10:49.815 --> 10:53.444
OK. I'll be right here, waiting.

10:53.519 --> 10:58.513
You think Shepherd and Grey
are gonna last? Like 50 years last?

10:58.591 --> 11:01.458
A semi crashed
into a bunch of college kids.

11:01.527 --> 11:04.462
On the day I decided
to take an extra shift in the ER.

11:04.530 --> 11:06.361
Great, thank you.

11:06.432 --> 11:10.766
There's burns, digit amputations,
nasty facial lacerations.

11:10.803 --> 11:12.964
- Don't go anywhere. OK?
- Relax.

11:13.039 --> 11:15.303
- Promise?
- You're handling this.

11:15.775 --> 11:17.606
I am handling it.

11:17.643 --> 11:20.578
You can't put him here.
Doctors need access!

11:24.316 --> 11:26.511
What went wrong last night?

11:27.119 --> 11:28.882
Kinda busy here, Arizona.

11:28.954 --> 11:32.481
I have four surgeries and a kid
on life support. I'm busy too.

11:32.525 --> 11:35.323
- What went wrong?
- Not any better. In the hall!

11:36.262 --> 11:39.026
We went out. To a four star restaurant.

11:39.098 --> 11:41.896
Best in Seattle.
Supposed to be fun. Romantic.

11:41.967 --> 11:45.266
But you order a salad when
they make delicious French food.

11:45.304 --> 11:47.932
You picked at it,
barely spoke and then bolted.

11:47.973 --> 11:50.271
What went wrong?
Did I do something?

11:50.309 --> 11:53.972
I wasn't feeling it.
I was exhausted. Sorry.

11:54.013 --> 11:57.949
Hey! I said the hall! The hall!

12:01.520 --> 12:02.714
Fill me in, O'Malley.

12:02.788 --> 12:05.018
Put in the chest tube,
but there was no blood.

12:05.091 --> 12:07.059
Tried another, but there's no pulse.

12:07.126 --> 12:09.424
- How long's he been down?
- Twenty minutes.

12:09.495 --> 12:11.190
- Open his chest...
- He's gone.

12:11.263 --> 12:15.165
- He's supposed to graduate...
- O'Malley, let it go. He's gone.

12:15.201 --> 12:18.398
You can't save him.
Move on to save the people you can.

12:19.171 --> 12:21.401
There's more trauma coming in.

12:21.474 --> 12:25.706
- O'Malley. Now! Move!
- Call it, Grey.

12:28.547 --> 12:31.015
Time of death, 9:24.

12:40.659 --> 12:44.993
It could be anything.
Could be scar tissue. Wait and see.

12:45.064 --> 12:47.589
- It's a tumor.
- You don't know that.

12:48.968 --> 12:51.528
Denny Duquette is standing behind you.

12:52.438 --> 12:55.498
It's a tumor. Right, Denny?

12:55.574 --> 12:59.340
Yeah. It's good to see you, Dr. Bailey.

13:00.780 --> 13:04.307
You can't see him. Because you don't
have a tumor. But he says hi.

13:04.350 --> 13:06.841
Tell Denny Duquette I said, "Go home."

13:15.394 --> 13:19.023
- It's a tumor.
- Wait and see.

13:24.003 --> 13:26.972
I'm sorry, I'm crying more than usual.

13:27.006 --> 13:29.998
You said it's shock, is that it?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.374
Yeah. Also the morphine.

13:33.212 --> 13:36.545
I should've slept with David.

13:36.615 --> 13:38.515
I thought about it,

13:38.551 --> 13:43.011
but he was sweet and funny...

13:43.055 --> 13:46.547
I would've fallen in love with him.

13:47.693 --> 13:50.662
And I didn't want
a relationship till after school.

13:50.696 --> 13:54.826
I don't like to do things halfway.

13:54.867 --> 13:59.566
I was doing school.
And then I was gonna do life.

13:59.638 --> 14:03.938
And now... David's dead.

14:05.411 --> 14:08.938
- David's dead.
- How's the CT, Karev?

14:09.114 --> 14:13.050
Stomach herniating into her hemithorax
from a huge lac in her diaphragm.

14:13.085 --> 14:17.715
OK. Becca, we're taking you
to surgery soon.

14:21.894 --> 14:26.831
I should have had sex with David
when I had the chance.

14:29.902 --> 14:33.531
Dana... Is she OK?

14:33.572 --> 14:36.564
The paramedics haven't
brought her in yet,

14:36.609 --> 14:41.308
but as soon they do, I'll let you know.
Do you have family we can contact?

14:41.380 --> 14:43.712
They're in Argentina.

14:43.749 --> 14:46.809
Supposed to fly there tomorrow.

14:46.886 --> 14:47.944
It's D-Day.

14:48.921 --> 14:52.322
- It's what?
- That's what Dana calls it.

14:52.925 --> 14:56.986
Parents don't have the money
to let me stay. I have to go back.

14:59.131 --> 15:01.156
Both knew D-Day was coming.

15:01.233 --> 15:03.997
Tried to break up with her
to make it easier.

15:04.069 --> 15:07.971
I'd switch classes every semester
so we didn't have any together...

15:09.975 --> 15:14.241
...but it didn't matter.
I couldn't stay away.

15:15.281 --> 15:19.115
When you love someone... Love is love.

15:20.619 --> 15:23.850
Doesn't matter that you're not
supposed to be together.

15:25.124 --> 15:26.989
How's he doing?

15:29.161 --> 15:30.822
He's starting to stabilize.

15:30.863 --> 15:33.127
Good. Looks like he's ready for CT.

15:33.165 --> 15:35.360
I think...

15:35.434 --> 15:38.494
...maybe she got out in time.

15:38.570 --> 15:41.664
Maybe she's not hurt that bad.

15:42.675 --> 15:44.643
Because when I turned around...

15:45.477 --> 15:48.139
...she wasn't there.

15:48.180 --> 15:50.842
She was not there anymore.

15:57.823 --> 16:00.724
OK, X-ray's really backed up, but...

16:00.793 --> 16:02.693
- That's Pete.
- What?

16:02.728 --> 16:05.720
David's friend. Pete.
The red sneakers.

16:05.798 --> 16:09.359
Help me. He's bleeding through
the dressing on the chest wound.

16:10.636 --> 16:12.570
Pulse is 220!

16:15.607 --> 16:19.543
Pericardial effusion.
Get me a syringe and a spinal needle.

16:20.713 --> 16:22.476
I'm going in through the wound.

16:25.117 --> 16:27.517
I need another syringe. Now.

16:27.553 --> 16:30.249
- There's too much blood.
- Keep syringes coming.

16:30.322 --> 16:33.621
Give me a 60cc this time.

16:33.692 --> 16:36.889
- Asystole. He's flat-lining.
- Get the cardio board.

16:36.962 --> 16:39.897
Just keep holding pressure.

16:39.965 --> 16:42.900
Starting compressions on my count.
One, two, three.

16:49.842 --> 16:51.867
- George...
- Keep putting pressure.

16:51.910 --> 16:53.605
I'm not losing another one.

17:00.352 --> 17:02.411
Thank you.

17:03.088 --> 17:06.079
You're scrubbing in?
I thought I was doing this solo.

17:06.157 --> 17:07.215
You are.

17:07.259 --> 17:09.853
Why aren't you
sitting in a corner, reading?

17:09.895 --> 17:12.864
It's a big day, Meredith.
Taking precautions.

17:12.897 --> 17:15.731
Afraid I'm gonna kill the patient
on my wedding day?

17:15.768 --> 17:18.601
It's a routine colectomy.
I'm not gonna kill him.

17:18.670 --> 17:21.730
I know. You're gonna do great.
Pretend I'm not even here.

17:21.773 --> 17:26.507
OK. OK. Scalpel.

17:28.313 --> 17:30.907
Great. Very nice.

17:32.284 --> 17:33.376
What?

17:33.419 --> 17:37.583
The way you asked for the scalpel.
You didn't mumble. You took charge.

17:37.623 --> 17:40.558
Right off the bat.
Loud and clear. "Scalpel."

17:40.592 --> 17:42.719
It was good. Very impressive.

17:43.562 --> 17:44.995
Great.

17:48.200 --> 17:50.259
I'm gonna get started now, so...

17:50.302 --> 17:54.261
Of course. You won't even know I'm here.

18:02.881 --> 18:04.906
- There we go.
- Thanks.

18:04.950 --> 18:07.384
I'll toast to the fact
they found each other.

18:07.453 --> 18:10.854
Doesn't bring up the future,
about whether they'll make it.

18:10.923 --> 18:12.914
- It's good, right?
- Mm-hm.

18:12.958 --> 18:14.619
You said you were tired.

18:14.660 --> 18:18.118
You can't be that exhausted
if you're working on your day off.

18:18.163 --> 18:19.653
- I rallied.
- You rallied?

18:19.731 --> 18:21.198
- Yeah.
- You're lying.

18:21.266 --> 18:24.167
No, I love the ER.
Can you hold, please? Thanks.

18:24.236 --> 18:28.138
- You love the ER?
- Can't get enough of it. It's fun.

18:32.911 --> 18:35.709
- You should tell her.
- Yeah... Suck it, Mark.

18:36.415 --> 18:38.781
Hey! We need more blood
in Trauma Two. Go!

18:40.018 --> 18:43.715
Dr. Hunt, I just lost another one.
My patients are dying. Pull me.

18:43.789 --> 18:46.849
That's for me to decide.
There's an ambulance coming.

18:46.892 --> 18:49.326
- I'm in over my head.
- Walk away, O'Malley!

18:51.163 --> 18:54.360
That's Michelle.
She dyed her hair for graduation.

18:59.004 --> 19:00.733
Look.

19:00.806 --> 19:03.400
I'm looking, I don't see anything.

19:03.475 --> 19:06.069
Because there's nothing there.
Scan's clean.

19:06.145 --> 19:07.203
I told you.

19:07.279 --> 19:10.737
Then why is Denny back?
The man's a hallucination.

19:10.816 --> 19:16.413
- There has to be something there.
- Izzie, if it's clear, then...

19:17.723 --> 19:20.089
I want to go to this wedding.

19:20.159 --> 19:24.596
I want to watch the bride walk
down the aisle. I want to hear the vows.

19:24.663 --> 19:26.494
I want to catch the bouquet.

19:26.532 --> 19:29.330
I planned this wedding
down to the last detail,

19:29.368 --> 19:33.771
it's the perfect wedding.
This wedding is perfect.

19:35.908 --> 19:38.433
You know how much I wanna be there.

19:38.510 --> 19:41.001
So why would I tell you about Denny?

19:41.046 --> 19:44.447
Today of all days?
Why wouldn't I just wait?

19:44.516 --> 19:48.885
Denny is back.
That means something is there.

19:48.921 --> 19:51.651
It's not like
we can just map the brain

19:51.723 --> 19:54.817
for hallucinations
the way we do with seizures.

19:54.893 --> 19:57.123
What are hallucinations?

19:57.196 --> 19:59.926
Hallucinations are
neurons firing in the brain.

19:59.965 --> 20:02.297
- Exactly.
- Why?

20:02.367 --> 20:05.268
It's never been done before,
but if we can somehow

20:05.337 --> 20:07.931
induce your hallucination,

20:08.006 --> 20:10.566
there's a chance we could
pick it up on an EEG.

20:10.609 --> 20:14.409
We could pinpoint the part
of the brain that's hallucinating.

20:15.013 --> 20:18.380
- Trauma One's open.
- What do we have?

20:18.417 --> 20:22.251
Had a pulse, but we haven't been
able to get one for over 30 minutes.

20:22.287 --> 20:25.586
I'm pretty sure we left half
her blood on the side of road.

20:25.624 --> 20:28.058
She's DOA. I just need you to call it.

20:28.093 --> 20:30.186
Oh, God. Oh, my God.

20:31.263 --> 20:34.357
Crap. Pink sweater.
That's Jordan's girlfriend.

20:34.433 --> 20:36.298
- Move her out.
- Need you to call it.

20:36.368 --> 20:38.768
Dana! Dana, no!

20:38.804 --> 20:40.294
Dana! No, I need to see her!

20:42.007 --> 20:46.444
- Time of death, 10:45.
- Coding. Get a crash cart.

20:50.549 --> 20:54.508
No. No, we are closed to trauma.

20:54.586 --> 20:57.077
Because we have trauma
coming out of our butts!

20:57.122 --> 21:01.081
You have a nice day, too!
Oh, for the love of...

21:01.126 --> 21:02.753
So the ER is fun, but I'm not?

21:02.794 --> 21:04.853
- Arizona...
- You can get enough of me?

21:04.930 --> 21:07.990
Is that what you're saying?
Do you just want to end this?

21:08.033 --> 21:10.001
There are women lining up. I'm hot.

21:10.068 --> 21:13.435
If you want out,
you should just say so. I can take it.

21:13.472 --> 21:16.339
Maybe this was just a fling.
Maybe it's over.

21:16.408 --> 21:18.433
Maybe it is.

21:24.449 --> 21:28.783
Got some adhesions. Need to
dissect down to mobilize the sigmoid.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.251
Bovie, please.

21:31.290 --> 21:33.986
Mm... Mm-mm. Mm-mm.

21:34.926 --> 21:37.156
Do you have something you'd like to say?

21:37.195 --> 21:39.356
No, no. You're doing fine.

21:41.933 --> 21:44.367
How's the solo surgery
coming along, Grey?

21:44.436 --> 21:48.202
I think it's going OK, but you should
probably ask the chief.

21:49.374 --> 21:51.035
She's doing great.

21:51.109 --> 21:54.738
Chose a cautery at one point when
I might have gone with scissors,

21:54.813 --> 21:55.973
but she made it work.

21:56.014 --> 21:58.949
We'll be out of here
in plenty of time for the wedding.

21:59.017 --> 22:01.679
Good. Then she won't have any excuses.

22:01.720 --> 22:02.812
Excuse me?

22:02.854 --> 22:05.687
This is the second time
I've been Derek's best man.

22:05.724 --> 22:09.387
I have to come up with a toast,
offer words of wisdom. A lot of work.

22:09.461 --> 22:13.420
I don't want to be his best man
a third time, if you know what I mean.

22:13.498 --> 22:18.629
- You came in here to threaten me?
- I'm his best man. That's my job.

22:18.670 --> 22:20.638
Mm.

22:20.672 --> 22:21.730
What now?

22:22.407 --> 22:24.500
No, it's OK. It's fine.

22:24.543 --> 22:27.706
Everything's fine, right?
I don't need to say anything.

22:27.746 --> 22:28.838
Hmm.

22:31.316 --> 22:35.377
So now what? I just...
try to have a hallucination?

22:35.420 --> 22:37.684
- Yeah.
- OK.

22:37.723 --> 22:42.285
Stevens, is it always Denny?
No one else?

22:42.361 --> 22:44.795
- Yeah.
- Hm...

22:44.830 --> 22:47.162
- What?
- Nothing. Um...

22:47.232 --> 22:49.564
Makes sense. It's the man you love...

22:49.601 --> 22:51.592
- He's not the man I love.
- He's not?

22:52.537 --> 22:56.098
I mean, I love Denny,
I will always love Denny.

22:56.174 --> 22:58.699
He means a lot to me.

22:59.444 --> 23:04.575
But I think I hallucinate Denny because
I associate him with death and dying.

23:04.616 --> 23:07.813
When I think about my future,
who I am and who I wanna be,

23:07.886 --> 23:12.949
how I want to spend my life...
When you get that flutter in your chest.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.983
Alex. Alex is the man I love.

23:17.796 --> 23:18.888
Karev.

23:20.298 --> 23:22.391
I love Alex Karev.

23:23.935 --> 23:27.803
So let's find this tumor
and get it out of me

23:27.873 --> 23:30.000
so we can have our perfect wedding,

23:30.075 --> 23:34.136
a wedding not wasted on two people
who don't appreciate weddings.

23:34.179 --> 23:37.706
- I can hear you.
- I mean for you to hear me.

23:40.485 --> 23:43.852
- What if I can't make him appear?
- We'll wait until he appears.

23:43.922 --> 23:47.153
You have to be at the church
in two hours. It could be more.

23:47.192 --> 23:49.683
- I'll be late.
- No! No being late.

23:49.761 --> 23:52.855
I'll make him appear. I can do this.

23:52.931 --> 23:54.922
Come on, Denny...

24:06.678 --> 24:09.511
How are my friends doing?

24:09.581 --> 24:12.880
Just tell me. I can take it.

24:14.820 --> 24:17.380
I mean, I can't but I can.

24:20.692 --> 24:22.091
Did someone else die?

24:22.160 --> 24:25.652
Why don't you tell me your speech?
Your graduation speech.

24:25.697 --> 24:27.062
I can take it.

24:27.132 --> 24:30.067
Becca. Just... Just give me your speech.

24:30.135 --> 24:33.798
You worked hard on it.
So you should do it. Right now.

24:33.839 --> 24:35.466
Come on.

24:38.310 --> 24:40.938
Today's the day my life begins.

24:43.181 --> 24:47.083
Today, I become a citizen of the world.

24:48.220 --> 24:51.451
Today, I become a grown-up.

24:52.858 --> 24:58.797
Today, I become accountable to someone
other than myself and my parents,

24:58.830 --> 25:01.697
accountable for more than my grades.

25:01.733 --> 25:05.499
Today I become accountable to the world.

25:06.171 --> 25:08.264
To the future.

25:08.340 --> 25:11.867
To all the possibilities
that life has to offer.

25:12.177 --> 25:14.441
Starting today...

25:14.513 --> 25:18.381
- Come on, Denny. Come on.
- ...my job is to show up,

25:20.552 --> 25:25.785
wide-eyed and willing and ready.

25:26.625 --> 25:30.493
For what, I don't know.

25:30.562 --> 25:35.124
For anything. For everything.

25:35.200 --> 25:37.464
Come on, Denny. Come on.

25:40.906 --> 25:45.240
- Charge to 360.
- To take on life.

25:45.710 --> 25:48.804
- Nice job, Meredith.
- To take on love.

25:48.880 --> 25:54.580
All the times I didn't ask for you,
you were here. Now I'm asking. Please.

25:55.420 --> 25:58.912
Please come to me now.
Please help me now.

25:58.957 --> 26:02.051
Come on, Denny. You come to me now.

26:03.094 --> 26:04.755
Denny...

26:07.399 --> 26:12.393
To take on the responsibility
and possibility.

26:17.208 --> 26:21.008
Today, my friends, our lives begin.

26:21.079 --> 26:22.842
Time of death, 13:02.

26:22.914 --> 26:24.643
And I, for one...

26:24.683 --> 26:26.674
Denny.

26:27.485 --> 26:28.782
- Denny!
- There.

26:29.788 --> 26:32.882
- ...can't wait.
- I'm here for you, Izzie.

26:33.792 --> 26:35.487
It's right there.

26:53.311 --> 26:56.576
These the results from the tesla 7 MRl?

26:56.615 --> 26:59.982
Yeah. The part of the brain that
reacted during the hallucination?

27:00.051 --> 27:03.612
It was the other temporal lobe.

27:03.655 --> 27:07.022
And that... That's the tumor?

27:07.092 --> 27:09.993
Yeah. Tiny.

27:10.028 --> 27:12.690
Too small to pick up on a normal MRl.

27:13.398 --> 27:16.834
If it's that small,
how are you going to get to it?

27:27.846 --> 27:30.508
I wish there was something
I could do for her.

27:30.582 --> 27:32.777
I wish I could.

27:33.685 --> 27:37.382
I like Stevens.
She's one of the good ones.

27:38.790 --> 27:41.554
I wish there was something
I could do for her.

27:46.031 --> 27:47.396
I...

27:49.934 --> 27:52.232
I know something you can do.

27:56.508 --> 27:59.409
I just want you to know that I'm hurt.

27:59.477 --> 28:01.377
I am hurt and I am angry.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.381
I thought we had something,
we were going somewhere.

28:04.449 --> 28:08.476
If you're just making the rounds of girl
surgeons then you ought to know...

28:08.520 --> 28:11.683
- We went to a fancy restaurant!
- What?

28:11.723 --> 28:15.420
We went to a fancy restaurant.
The nicest restaurant in Seattle.

28:15.493 --> 28:19.327
The salad I ordered...
The salad cost $26.95.

28:19.364 --> 28:22.026
The wine you ordered cost $125 a bottle.

28:22.067 --> 28:26.436
I didn't even look at the entrees
because I was already out 75 bucks,

28:26.504 --> 28:28.404
and I don't even like salad.

28:29.841 --> 28:33.777
- Then the bill came and you...
- I paid.

28:33.845 --> 28:36.939
You know what I was doing before
they brought the check?

28:37.015 --> 28:39.506
I was counting in my head,

28:39.551 --> 28:43.544
trying to figure out how I was going
to buy food the rest of the week

28:43.588 --> 28:47.024
if my half was $ 75, because
I don't have seventy-five dollars.

28:47.058 --> 28:52.291
Because my father disowned me and
cleared out my bank account. I'm broke!

28:52.363 --> 28:55.764
And I am exhausted, Arizona.

28:55.834 --> 28:58.632
I'm working in the ER
because I need the money.

29:01.406 --> 29:05.274
Six people died on my watch
today and I'm fried.

29:08.546 --> 29:10.241
I wanted to stay in last night.

29:10.281 --> 29:15.241
I thought... I thought last night
would be the night. For us.

29:15.286 --> 29:17.914
You know, our night.

29:17.956 --> 29:22.950
But you wanted to go to a
fancy restaurant, and I can't do that.

29:22.994 --> 29:26.430
- I can't.
- It's OK. It's OK. Hey.

29:26.898 --> 29:29.731
So we stay in.

29:29.768 --> 29:34.068
And we'll eat... sandwiches.

29:34.105 --> 29:36.903
You don't even like sandwiches.

29:36.941 --> 29:39.637
But I like the girl
who has the sandwiches.

29:41.880 --> 29:44.246
- OK?
- OK.

29:45.283 --> 29:47.945
I don't like sandwiches either.
I like pizza.

29:49.587 --> 29:51.316
I like pizza, too.

29:55.927 --> 29:57.155
Meredith?

29:59.097 --> 30:00.689
Yes, sir?

30:00.765 --> 30:03.165
I've been reading
your mother's journals.

30:03.201 --> 30:04.725
I wish she was here today.

30:04.803 --> 30:08.796
I don't know how she
would've felt about me getting married.

30:08.840 --> 30:12.867
No. Not for that. For this.
Your first solo surgery.

30:12.944 --> 30:17.881
She probably would've said, with all the
mistakes, I'm lucky the patient's alive.

30:17.949 --> 30:21.578
That's right. But I also know
she would have been thrilled.

30:21.653 --> 30:25.885
She wouldn't have been able to tell you,
but she would've been.

30:25.957 --> 30:27.686
Thank you, sir.

30:33.131 --> 30:34.621
- Hey!
- Hey.

30:34.666 --> 30:36.896
You. Best wedding present ever.

30:36.968 --> 30:39.664
- And you know why?
- No.

30:41.306 --> 30:46.141
Because I have to go home and put on
a corset and pantyhose and petticoat.

30:46.177 --> 30:50.079
And look like one of those idiots
on top of a wedding cake, then I have to

30:50.148 --> 30:53.675
walk down the aisle and have
everyone staring at me, but it's OK.

30:53.718 --> 30:57.711
Because I got to cut
someone open from start to finish.

30:57.789 --> 30:59.188
I saved a life.

30:59.224 --> 31:02.887
- Um...
- What?

31:02.961 --> 31:06.488
What do you say
we make this day even better?

31:12.237 --> 31:14.000
Good work today, O'Malley.

31:14.038 --> 31:17.098
Good work? They're dead. All those kids.

31:17.175 --> 31:20.508
- Not all of them.
- The one I didn't touch was fine.

31:20.545 --> 31:22.103
I was able to get to her.

31:22.180 --> 31:25.274
And the reason I was,
was because I had you on my team.

31:25.350 --> 31:28.547
You saved that girl today
as much as I did.

31:32.290 --> 31:34.554
Trauma's a team sport, O'Malley.

31:34.592 --> 31:36.856
You don't have to be the hero,
you just...

31:39.364 --> 31:42.060
You just have to go where you're needed.

31:50.575 --> 31:51.872
Alex...

31:53.411 --> 31:57.848
Bailey says Shepherd found another
tumor. In Izzie's brain. Did you hear?

31:57.916 --> 32:00.578
I heard. Alex...

32:00.618 --> 32:03.815
He doesn't think he's gonna
get it out this time.

32:05.290 --> 32:06.848
I think...

32:13.731 --> 32:15.824
I think she's gonna die on me.

32:17.902 --> 32:20.336
I think she's really gonna die.

32:25.576 --> 32:29.137
Aren't you supposed to be
getting ready for a wedding?

32:29.213 --> 32:32.114
That's what I came
to talk to you about.

32:38.156 --> 32:41.523
Hi, I'm Dr. Grey. I'm gonna
take care of your central line.

32:41.592 --> 32:42.957
OK.

32:51.002 --> 32:53.527
You're crying.

32:53.604 --> 32:55.265
You're breathing.

33:06.317 --> 33:10.720
My shoes are, uh,
in the closet. Bailey?

33:10.788 --> 33:11.982
Shoes. Right.

33:13.358 --> 33:16.725
You're supposed to be
helping me get ready.

33:16.794 --> 33:21.254
I can still go, right? I mean,
the tumor's not going anywhere.

33:21.332 --> 33:23.800
Yeah, you can go.

33:23.835 --> 33:26.998
OK, well, we don't wanna be late.

33:28.106 --> 33:30.734
- Bailey?
- Uh... Here she comes.

33:32.310 --> 33:35.768
Mer! You're supposed to be
at the church!

33:35.847 --> 33:38.680
I'm going. I just came to say,
this isn't my dress.

33:38.716 --> 33:41.184
Of course it's your dress. It's perfect.

33:41.219 --> 33:45.019
- What are you talking about?
- This dress is not for me.

33:45.056 --> 33:47.752
I don't... What?

33:47.825 --> 33:52.091
Oh, God, I knew you were gonna
freak out before the wedding.

33:52.163 --> 33:56.600
Mer, Derek loves you. Marriage is good.

33:56.667 --> 33:57.998
Tell her, it's good.

33:58.036 --> 34:02.097
She's saying it's not her wedding dress.

34:05.910 --> 34:07.104
She's right.

34:08.513 --> 34:10.708
The dress, it isn't for Meredith.

34:43.815 --> 34:45.873
Oh, Mer...

34:46.918 --> 34:48.385
I don't...

34:49.253 --> 34:51.915
I don't even know how to...

34:52.389 --> 34:53.982
I...

34:55.893 --> 34:57.292
Thank you.

34:58.563 --> 35:02.090
OK, so who's the maid of honor?
Me or Cristina?

35:02.133 --> 35:03.691
Cristina.

35:04.235 --> 35:09.263
Alex... He needs a best man,
and he was asking for you.

35:09.307 --> 35:13.641
- So what, I'm leftovers?
- You tried to save my life.

35:13.678 --> 35:16.340
That makes you honorable.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.890
Take my hand.

36:09.967 --> 36:13.733
Dearly beloved,
we are gathered here today

36:13.804 --> 36:18.002
to celebrate the wedding
of Alexander Michael Karev

36:18.042 --> 36:20.806
and Isobel Catherine Stevens.

36:26.217 --> 36:28.378
This is a sacred rite...

36:28.452 --> 36:31.012
...an ancient rite.

36:31.722 --> 36:36.182
As Isobel and Alex
prepare to join their lives,

36:36.227 --> 36:40.425
it is important to understand
that everyone present

36:40.498 --> 36:43.729
has played a part
in shaping their lives,

36:43.768 --> 36:48.831
and will continue to play a vital role
in their continuing future.

36:48.873 --> 36:53.674
And thus, we are here not only
to witness their vows to each other,

36:53.711 --> 36:57.579
but to bestow upon them our blessing.

37:00.518 --> 37:03.715
And now, the couple
will read their vows.

37:03.754 --> 37:05.449
We didn't write anything.

37:05.489 --> 37:08.185
No. Wait,
I have something I want to say.

37:12.697 --> 37:15.131
Today's the day my life begins.

37:16.467 --> 37:20.767
All my life I've been just me.
Just a smart mouth kid.

37:22.607 --> 37:24.097
Today, I become a man.

37:25.409 --> 37:27.900
Today, I become a husband.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.610
Today, I become accountable
to someone other than myself.

37:33.918 --> 37:38.378
Today I become accountable to you.
To our future.

37:38.456 --> 37:42.017
To all the possibilities
that our marriage has to offer.

37:43.427 --> 37:47.864
Together, no matter what happens,
I'll be ready.

37:49.367 --> 37:52.803
For anything. For everything.

37:54.672 --> 37:58.164
To take on life. To take on love.

37:58.242 --> 38:01.268
To take on possibility
and responsibility.

38:02.446 --> 38:06.610
Today, Izzie Stevens,
our life together begins.

38:06.651 --> 38:08.949
And I, for one, can't wait.

38:08.986 --> 38:10.817
I love you.

38:13.524 --> 38:15.719
- Not yet.
- Hurry up.

38:15.793 --> 38:19.854
By the power vested in me
by God and the state of Washington,

38:19.930 --> 38:23.525
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

38:23.601 --> 38:25.193
- Now?
- Now.

39:19.023 --> 39:22.925
<i>You never know the biggest</i>
<i>day of your life is the biggest day.</i>

39:24.462 --> 39:26.487
<i>Not until it's happening.</i>

39:45.483 --> 39:49.476
Hey, hey... It's OK. It's just hair.
You don't need it.

39:49.520 --> 39:52.045
It's just gonna keep falling out.

39:52.123 --> 39:56.685
We'll shave it off.
I bet you look good bald. OK?

40:04.335 --> 40:06.803
Hey.

40:08.372 --> 40:11.535
Stop. You're beautiful.

40:18.649 --> 40:21.550
<i>You don't recognize</i>
<i>the biggest day of your life.</i>

40:21.585 --> 40:25.521
<i>Not until you're right</i>
<i>in the middle of it.</i>

40:27.691 --> 40:33.152
<i>The day you commit</i>
<i>to something or someone...</i>

40:38.335 --> 40:40.895
<i>The day you get your heart broken...</i>

40:44.008 --> 40:46.238
Best non-wedding day ever.

40:47.411 --> 40:49.606
Wanna go again?

40:59.223 --> 41:01.885
<i>The day you meet your soul mate.</i>

41:04.895 --> 41:09.457
The day you realize
there's not enough time...

41:10.801 --> 41:14.601
...because you want to live forever.

41:14.638 --> 41:17.129
Those are the biggest days.

41:18.676 --> 41:20.701
The perfect days.

41:23.781 --> 41:25.976
You know?

41:26.817 --> 41:30.275
I'll bet you made a beautiful bride.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.690
It was a beautiful day.

41:36.360 --> 41:38.021
You put the scarf on.

41:38.095 --> 41:41.428
I told you, you don't need it.
You look gorgeous without it.

41:42.900 --> 41:44.299
He's right.

41:46.103 --> 41:47.195
Go away now.

41:48.572 --> 41:51.040
Go away, I want to be alone...

41:51.108 --> 41:53.668
...with my husband.

42:13.864 --> 42:15.092
My wife is hot.
