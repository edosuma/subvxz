WEBVTT

00:06.720 --> 00:08.368
- Buongiorno, Ragazzi!
- Hey.

00:08.488 --> 00:10.205
Hey. I brought love.

00:10.239 --> 00:11.139
Love?

00:11.173 --> 00:12.874
Uh-huh. Bocconotti.

00:12.908 --> 00:14.509
"Boccone" means "mouthful,"

00:14.543 --> 00:16.244
but I call them
"Boccone del Amore,"

00:16.279 --> 00:17.779
which means
"Mouthfuls of Love."

00:17.813 --> 00:19.681
Oh, they're a little bit
like windbeutel.

00:19.715 --> 00:21.249
"Windbeutel?"

00:21.284 --> 00:23.551
You know what's wrong
with Germany?

00:23.586 --> 00:25.954
You don't use passion
in your food names.

00:25.988 --> 00:27.589
Yes, we do.

00:27.623 --> 00:29.059
"Sauerbraten?"
"Wier Schnitzel?"

00:29.179 --> 00:30.397
Wiener Schnitzel is Austrian.

00:30.517 --> 00:31.793
Tommy,

00:31.827 --> 00:33.061
which would you prefer to eat?

00:33.095 --> 00:34.629
Something called "sauerbraten,"

00:34.664 --> 00:36.831
or something called
"Mouthfuls of Love?"

00:36.866 --> 00:38.934
Anything quiet.

00:39.468 --> 00:40.735
Didn't shakespre already say,

00:40.769 --> 00:42.603
"A rose by any other name
is still a rose."

00:42.638 --> 00:43.604
Yeah.

00:43.639 --> 00:45.039
But that was about smell,

00:45.073 --> 00:47.041
and smell is not love.
Smell is smell.

00:47.076 --> 00:49.777
I'm going to go where people
know how to be quiet.

00:51.147 --> 00:52.940
Did you party again last night?

00:57.653 --> 01:00.555
Chill out, mother, will you?

01:01.824 --> 01:03.096
He needs more love.

01:05.895 --> 01:06.861
Tommy.

01:07.536 --> 01:08.525
Sir.

01:14.070 --> 01:17.272
Your irishman
smells like a distillery.

01:17.306 --> 01:19.240
Good morning, Dorn.

01:19.275 --> 01:22.043
There's something
I need to show you.

01:26.249 --> 01:29.684
This is the hotel room
I was in last week in Moscow.

01:29.719 --> 01:31.853
You were in Moscow?

01:31.887 --> 01:33.688
I secreted a camera

01:33.723 --> 01:35.557
to send back these images.

01:35.591 --> 01:40.195
The ICC gave me my own
aes-encrypted wp to wifi.

01:40.229 --> 01:42.631
They found it
in less than a minute.

01:42.665 --> 01:45.033
They are unusually good.

01:45.067 --> 01:47.068
You were not supposed to go.

01:47.103 --> 01:51.321
The point, Louis,
is that Dimitrov knew.

01:51.441 --> 01:53.007
He knew I was there.

01:53.127 --> 01:54.953
He knew I was looking for him.

01:55.073 --> 01:57.245
Those are his men.

01:57.280 --> 01:59.292
Are you absolutely certain

01:59.412 --> 02:01.349
that the Marianski kidnapping
had nothing to do with

02:01.384 --> 02:03.460
him being my source?

02:03.580 --> 02:04.294
I'm sure.

02:04.414 --> 02:06.821
The kidnapping
was planned by the ex-wife.

02:06.856 --> 02:08.889
To hurt him, for his money.

02:08.925 --> 02:10.125
She confessed.

02:13.829 --> 02:16.380
And you've said nothing
about my looking into this?

02:16.500 --> 02:18.099
No. No one.

02:18.641 --> 02:19.915
Except Rebecca.

02:20.035 --> 02:21.725
Oh, I told it to Rebecca.

02:25.841 --> 02:27.609
She went back to Paris
yesterday.

02:32.539 --> 02:33.489
Hello?

02:33.609 --> 02:34.364
<i>Rebecca,</i>

02:34.484 --> 02:35.662
I'm coming home this morning.

02:35.782 --> 02:36.651
Oh!

02:37.327 --> 02:38.943
Louis, that's lovely.

02:39.063 --> 02:40.419
Could we have lunch together?

02:40.539 --> 02:42.357
Are you asking me on a date?

02:42.391 --> 02:44.693
<i>Yes.</i>

02:44.727 --> 02:46.394
- I'd love that.
- Good.

02:46.429 --> 02:47.395
I'll see you at noon.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.487
Okay, see you.

02:49.607 --> 02:50.966
Anne-Marie?

02:51.000 --> 02:52.100
<i>Yes?</i>

02:52.134 --> 02:53.655
I need to go
to Paris for the day.

02:53.775 --> 02:54.677
<i>Okay.</i>

02:54.797 --> 02:55.788
Anne-Marie?

02:55.908 --> 02:57.772
Do you know where Hickman is?

02:57.807 --> 03:00.942
<i>He said</i>
<i>he had to run an errand.</i>

03:02.000 --> 03:08.074
-= www.OpenSubtitles.org =-

03:17.994 --> 03:19.694
Do you speak English?

03:19.729 --> 03:21.296
Doesn't everybody?

03:21.330 --> 03:23.064
We're certainly trying.

03:23.099 --> 03:25.700
May I see the manager?

03:25.735 --> 03:27.268
Do you have an appointment?

03:27.303 --> 03:30.325
No, but when he knows
what I'm here about,

03:30.445 --> 03:32.417
he'll want to talk to me.

03:32.537 --> 03:36.195
I'm afraid you can only see
Mr. Stoop with an appointment.

03:36.315 --> 03:37.913
So let's make an appointment.

03:37.947 --> 03:39.716
He has nothing free
till Monday.

03:40.679 --> 03:41.873
You don't need to check?

03:41.993 --> 03:43.024
No.

03:43.144 --> 03:44.786
We have procedures in place.

03:45.320 --> 03:47.522
You're not the type
to hide behind procedure.

03:47.556 --> 03:48.556
I'm not hiding.

03:48.590 --> 03:49.891
No, you're sitting
at the help desk,

03:49.925 --> 03:51.325
keeping your fingers busy

03:51.360 --> 03:52.660
so that the rest
of the staff can see

03:52.695 --> 03:54.495
that you're still prepared
to get your hands dirty

03:54.530 --> 03:56.697
even though you're wearing
a 1,000 Euro suit.

03:56.732 --> 03:59.333
And your nametag
says "Secretary,"

03:59.368 --> 04:00.501
but "Anika"

04:00.536 --> 04:02.737
is no more a secretary
than the secretary of state,

04:02.771 --> 04:06.607
and you don't follow procedures,
you write them.

04:06.642 --> 04:08.609
It's pronounced Ahh-ni-ka.

04:08.644 --> 04:09.744
Oh, "Anika."

04:09.778 --> 04:13.481
And my suit cost 800 Euros,

04:13.515 --> 04:15.316
and, though
I'm moderately impressed

04:15.350 --> 04:17.218
and just a little bit flattered,

04:17.252 --> 04:18.452
you still can't see him.

04:21.190 --> 04:22.424
Anika,

04:22.458 --> 04:25.427
I'm going to give you
a way out of our little impasse

04:25.461 --> 04:27.195
by asking you

04:27.229 --> 04:31.366
to put this account number
under his nose,

04:31.400 --> 04:34.803
along with the magic word

04:34.837 --> 04:36.438
"Carnival."

04:39.538 --> 04:40.528
Please?

04:42.445 --> 04:44.145
Please.

05:08.871 --> 05:09.938
Berger.

05:09.972 --> 05:11.439
<i>Keep the line open.</i>

05:11.474 --> 05:13.008
Okay, you have five minutes.

05:13.042 --> 05:14.843
Where's your panic button?

05:14.877 --> 05:15.944
<i>Excuse me?</i>

05:15.978 --> 05:17.479
Where's your panic button?
We're about to be...

05:17.513 --> 05:19.814
Everyone down! Down!

05:29.926 --> 05:32.093
Down on the ground!

05:40.370 --> 05:44.020
Are you deaf of stupid?
Get on the floor!

05:57.553 --> 06:01.356
Your attention, if you please.

06:01.390 --> 06:03.158
I'm not here for your money,

06:03.192 --> 06:05.227
I am here for the bank's money.

06:05.261 --> 06:08.263
<i>What they have stolen,</i>
<i>I am stealing back.</i>

06:08.297 --> 06:09.497
For most of you,

06:09.532 --> 06:11.233
this will go smoothly
and efficiently,

06:11.267 --> 06:12.976
and you can
get back to your lives.

06:13.096 --> 06:14.938
However,

06:15.058 --> 06:16.738
there may be one or two

06:16.858 --> 06:19.307
who believe
this is a time for heroes.

06:21.410 --> 06:22.844
Hit the glass.

06:23.879 --> 06:24.846
The phone.

06:27.650 --> 06:31.219
He only misses if he wants to.

06:31.253 --> 06:32.587
So...

06:34.490 --> 06:38.894
are there any heroes
amongst you today?

06:38.928 --> 06:40.228
Anyone

06:40.263 --> 06:41.930
who would like to interfere
in our business here?

06:41.964 --> 06:44.272
Because if you do,

06:44.392 --> 06:47.269
we will not only kill you,

06:47.303 --> 06:50.138
we will kill every single person
in this bank.

for www.addic7ed.com

07:30.493 --> 07:33.166
What's going on?

07:33.661 --> 07:34.627
It's Hickman.

07:34.662 --> 07:37.463
He seems to be
inside a robbery.

07:38.399 --> 07:40.300
Dorn...

07:41.836 --> 07:43.470
Can you take care of Paris
for me, please?

07:43.505 --> 07:48.041
Your American
is inside a bank robbery?

07:48.076 --> 07:49.543
Quite an unlucky fellow.

07:49.577 --> 07:51.512
Bad luck or coincidence?

07:51.546 --> 07:53.313
Coincidence is a concept

07:53.348 --> 07:55.482
I have a great deal
of difficulty with.

07:55.517 --> 07:56.984
Get your cell phones out

07:57.018 --> 07:58.785
and hold them
in your right hand

07:58.820 --> 07:59.753
where I can see 'em!

08:03.591 --> 08:06.177
Lot of great big bags
to bring to a robbery.

08:06.297 --> 08:08.962
Three, four, five bags.

08:08.997 --> 08:11.765
Yes, I can see that.

08:11.800 --> 08:14.868
Fully automatic
machine pistols.

08:18.640 --> 08:20.841
Who are you?

08:20.875 --> 08:22.676
Come on!

08:22.710 --> 08:23.844
Come on.

08:23.878 --> 08:25.712
That's it, go on.

08:25.747 --> 08:27.014
Hey...

08:27.048 --> 08:28.448
Where's your phone?

08:28.483 --> 08:29.817
My right hand is disabled.

08:29.851 --> 08:31.452
I can't hold a phone in it.

08:31.486 --> 08:32.419
What?

08:32.453 --> 08:33.854
You said to use my right hand.

08:33.888 --> 08:34.855
What's going on?

08:34.889 --> 08:37.236
Says his right hand don't work.

08:37.792 --> 08:38.592
Are you trying to be funny?

08:38.626 --> 08:39.793
No.

08:39.828 --> 08:41.028
You think you're John Wayne?

08:41.062 --> 08:42.462
Not even close.

08:42.496 --> 08:44.097
Use your left hand.

08:56.811 --> 08:58.078
I got this one.

08:58.113 --> 08:59.513
Sorry, Wolf.

08:59.547 --> 09:00.914
No worries.
Get the manager.

09:02.484 --> 09:04.852
You know why
I wear a wolf mask?

09:06.421 --> 09:08.422
You smell like a wet dog?

09:08.456 --> 09:11.592
Wolves are adept at seeing
their way through traps.

09:11.626 --> 09:14.428
They have an uncanny talent
for reading the lay of the land.

09:14.462 --> 09:16.964
Hunters even report them
digging up traps

09:16.998 --> 09:19.633
and deactivating them
before they become a problem.

09:20.935 --> 09:22.503
You're not
going to become a problem,

09:22.537 --> 09:24.938
are you, John Wayne
with the crippled hand?

09:24.973 --> 09:27.574
Should I deactivate you?

09:27.609 --> 09:29.977
No problem here.

09:34.449 --> 09:35.883
He hung up.

09:35.917 --> 09:36.917
I got a trace, though.

09:36.951 --> 09:39.419
He's at the International
Bank den Haag.

09:39.454 --> 09:41.488
I told the locals
we have an officer inside.

09:41.523 --> 09:45.425
He said six robbers,
five bags of equipment,

09:45.460 --> 09:47.094
and full auto pistols.

09:47.128 --> 09:48.896
I can get inside
the security cameras.

09:48.930 --> 09:52.533
Move! Move! Get in there!

09:52.567 --> 09:53.901
Move it!

09:57.639 --> 09:59.606
Look what I found
in the closet.

09:59.641 --> 10:00.974
The bank manager

10:01.009 --> 10:02.409
and a fat lady and her husband.

10:02.444 --> 10:04.811
She's not fat, she's pregnant.

10:04.846 --> 10:06.046
Get on the floor!

10:06.080 --> 10:07.181
Face down!

10:07.215 --> 10:10.050
She can't lie on her front
because of the baby.

10:10.084 --> 10:13.520
I was hoping you'd let her go,
keep me instead.

10:13.555 --> 10:15.122
And I was hoping
you'd do as you're told

10:15.156 --> 10:16.790
so I don't have to waste
two bullets.

10:16.825 --> 10:19.026
Please!
I will do it!

10:19.060 --> 10:20.127
Haven't you got
enough hostages?

10:20.161 --> 10:20.928
Why don't you let her go?

10:20.962 --> 10:23.831
Keep your mouth shut.

10:25.633 --> 10:29.002
Let's get the lady a chair.

10:29.037 --> 10:30.838
What are we, animals?

10:30.872 --> 10:32.506
Come on, my love, sit down.

10:32.540 --> 10:35.676
You, too. Cozy up.

10:35.710 --> 10:37.010
There now, is that better,

10:37.045 --> 10:40.113
John Wayne with
the crippled hand?

10:40.148 --> 10:43.617
Mr. Bank Manager...

10:44.364 --> 10:45.452
The vault key.

10:45.487 --> 10:46.820
Key?

10:46.855 --> 10:48.789
The vault's on a time lock.

10:48.823 --> 10:51.024
Which opens in 365 seconds,

10:51.059 --> 10:53.026
and requires the key

10:53.061 --> 10:56.497
which you wear
around your neck.

10:56.531 --> 10:57.898
Sorry...

10:57.932 --> 10:59.933
I'm getting very tired
of being questioned.

10:59.968 --> 11:01.869
I'm sorry.

11:02.904 --> 11:05.239
Why was that young couple
here to see you today?

11:05.273 --> 11:06.240
Excuse me?

11:06.274 --> 11:08.542
I'm not big
on repeating myself.

11:08.576 --> 11:10.268
They applied for credit.

11:10.388 --> 11:10.923
A loan.

11:11.043 --> 11:14.848
Ah. Were they successful?

11:14.883 --> 11:16.250
Were you successful?

11:16.284 --> 11:19.119
Were you able to acquire a loan?

11:19.154 --> 11:21.488
What did you want,
something for the baby?

11:21.523 --> 11:23.123
It's okay, sir, we didn't...

11:23.158 --> 11:24.725
What did you need?

11:24.759 --> 11:26.827
Furniture, for the nursery.

11:26.861 --> 11:29.196
Furn... a bed for the baby
and he said no?

11:29.230 --> 11:30.931
No,
I didn't have a choice!

11:30.965 --> 11:32.232
What's that?

11:32.993 --> 11:34.187
Do you work?

11:34.307 --> 11:35.727
Yes. Yes, I work.

11:35.847 --> 11:37.154
- Mm-hmm. Every day?
- Every day.

11:37.274 --> 11:39.039
Please, sir,
it is not his fault.

11:39.073 --> 11:40.941
Our credit is not good.

11:40.975 --> 11:42.209
Now, how can it be

11:42.243 --> 11:45.245
that you get to refuse
this hardworking young couple

11:45.280 --> 11:46.914
the funds to look after
their newborn,

11:46.948 --> 11:49.116
and somehow they think
it's their fault?

11:49.150 --> 11:50.517
We have a formula...

11:50.552 --> 11:51.985
Scores, which...

11:52.020 --> 11:53.821
I'd like you to reconsider,
Mr. Bank Manager.

11:53.855 --> 11:54.922
Can you do that for me?

11:54.956 --> 11:56.657
Can you put aside
your formulas and your scores

11:56.691 --> 11:58.625
and act like
a bloody human being?

11:58.660 --> 11:59.593
Yes. Of course.

11:59.627 --> 12:01.562
They can have it,
anything they want!

12:01.596 --> 12:03.931
No. Please...

12:09.037 --> 12:12.306
Now, I know you're not
predisposed, culturally,

12:12.340 --> 12:14.041
to silence,

12:14.075 --> 12:15.642
but I need you to understand

12:15.677 --> 12:19.680
this is not
an audience-participation sport.

12:23.952 --> 12:26.153
No! No, no, don't shoot!
Don't shoot!

12:26.187 --> 12:27.654
They put a bomb on me!

12:31.259 --> 12:33.760
Don't shoot!
They put a bomb on me!

12:33.795 --> 12:35.095
Don't shoot!

12:45.006 --> 12:48.108
Am I making myself clear now,

12:48.143 --> 12:49.743
John Wayne
with the crippled hand?

12:57.096 --> 12:59.130
Okay, I want a sniper
on that balcony.

12:59.165 --> 13:01.901
I want one on that balcony,
I want one on that roof.

13:02.021 --> 13:05.804
Why did they kill
Mr. Stoop?

13:05.838 --> 13:08.640
He gave them the vault key.

13:09.370 --> 13:11.608
They seem to want a show.

13:12.578 --> 13:13.611
Why?

13:13.646 --> 13:15.547
I don't know.

13:15.581 --> 13:17.082
Now that woke the cops up.

13:17.116 --> 13:19.551
I'm monitoring
their frequencies.

13:19.585 --> 13:21.019
Good.

13:21.053 --> 13:22.887
Mr. Pig, prep the doors.

13:22.922 --> 13:24.656
Mr. Tiger,
head upstairs,

13:24.690 --> 13:26.091
if you please.

13:55.448 --> 13:56.382
Right there.

13:56.502 --> 13:57.021
You're sure?

13:57.056 --> 13:58.531
Yeah. Completely.

13:58.651 --> 14:01.059
They in the vault?

14:01.093 --> 14:02.694
Yeah, it's the right area.

14:02.728 --> 14:04.395
They need to drill?

14:24.116 --> 14:26.651
Each camera, one shot.

14:26.685 --> 14:28.653
Guy's good.

14:28.687 --> 14:29.854
Good?

14:29.889 --> 14:31.689
To hit those little cameras,
the guy's excellent.

14:31.724 --> 14:33.258
Yeah, but why
shoot the camera

14:33.292 --> 14:34.692
for a simple robbery

14:34.727 --> 14:36.127
when you're wearing a mask?

14:36.162 --> 14:38.196
Back that up.

14:39.899 --> 14:41.232
He's shooting
goofy-foot.

14:41.267 --> 14:42.333
What's "goofy-foot?"

14:42.368 --> 14:44.936
Well, left-handed,
but standing like a righty.

14:44.970 --> 14:45.804
You see?

14:45.838 --> 14:47.072
The wrong foot's in the front.

14:47.106 --> 14:48.840
Nobody shoots like that.

14:48.874 --> 14:50.375
They have more than
enough time to rob the place

14:50.409 --> 14:51.309
and get out.

14:51.343 --> 14:52.210
They don't seem to be
in a hurry.

14:52.244 --> 14:54.412
Bank robberies
average six minutes

14:54.447 --> 14:56.047
between passing of note
to an escape.

14:56.082 --> 14:58.216
These guys have been inside
for almost 10.

14:58.250 --> 15:00.185
Their van is already
in police custody,

15:00.219 --> 15:01.119
so even if they do come out,

15:01.153 --> 15:02.720
they're not
going to go anywhere.

15:02.755 --> 15:05.423
Unless they don't plan

15:05.458 --> 15:06.991
to come out the front door.

15:07.026 --> 15:08.359
The first thing you look for
when you plan these things

15:08.394 --> 15:09.661
is a way out.

15:09.695 --> 15:11.930
I mean, wouldn't you?

15:11.964 --> 15:13.361
As far as I can tell,
they don't have one.

15:13.481 --> 15:13.980
Well, yeah, that's maybe

15:14.100 --> 15:15.534
exactly what they don't
want us to see.

15:15.654 --> 15:16.507
How they're going to escape.

15:16.627 --> 15:17.335
That's what I mean.

15:17.369 --> 15:18.570
Yeah, and Hickman said

15:18.604 --> 15:20.405
that they brought a lot
of equipment into the bank.

15:20.439 --> 15:21.773
I'll pull city records

15:21.807 --> 15:23.441
to see if there are
any points of hidden egress.

15:23.476 --> 15:24.943
Sebastian...
Hickman's phone?

15:24.977 --> 15:27.312
It's not working. Permanently.

15:29.014 --> 15:32.016
What happened to your hand?

15:32.051 --> 15:33.718
Accident.

15:34.378 --> 15:35.588
Oi!

15:35.708 --> 15:37.193
Didn't wolf tell you

15:37.313 --> 15:38.637
to shut the hell up?

15:38.757 --> 15:40.191
Whatever your boss says.

15:40.226 --> 15:41.826
He ain't my boss.

15:41.861 --> 15:43.928
Oh. Okay.

15:43.963 --> 15:45.230
Pig?

15:45.264 --> 15:46.431
You okay there?

15:46.465 --> 15:48.700
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no worries.

15:49.362 --> 15:50.854
I've got it.

15:51.404 --> 15:53.905
Do you want me to cripple
that hand even more?

15:53.939 --> 15:55.974
Don't get yourself in trouble.

16:02.381 --> 16:04.315
I've been thinking

16:04.350 --> 16:06.317
that maybe my share
should be a little bigger.

16:08.054 --> 16:12.123
I mean, I did take
most of the chances.

16:12.158 --> 16:13.858
You've been thinking.

16:13.893 --> 16:15.794
Okay, I've got
a voice recognition hit

16:15.828 --> 16:16.828
on the ringleader.

16:16.862 --> 16:18.229
Alex Vaughn.

16:18.264 --> 16:19.230
British national.

16:19.265 --> 16:21.833
Alex Vaughn is out of prison?

16:21.867 --> 16:22.967
Paroled two years go.

16:23.002 --> 16:24.135
<i>You know him, Tommy?</i>

16:24.170 --> 16:25.170
<i>He had</i>
<i>a drug trafficking crew</i>

16:25.204 --> 16:26.319
<i>in the '90s.</i>

16:26.439 --> 16:28.784
Says he became
radicalized in prison

16:28.904 --> 16:32.010
and turned to organized anarchy
<i>and anti-capitalism.</i>

16:32.044 --> 16:35.513
He's suspected of a shooting
at the G8 summit in 2010.

16:37.483 --> 16:39.250
They're anti-capitalist
bank robbers

16:39.285 --> 16:40.351
who are greedy?

16:40.386 --> 16:44.322
<i>No, they're</i>
<i>wankers with guns.</i>

16:48.160 --> 16:50.495
Aw, that is really unpleasant.

16:50.529 --> 16:52.030
I used to work
on a perfume counter,

16:52.064 --> 16:53.998
all I can smell is flowers.

16:54.033 --> 16:55.366
Well, maybe
you should do the recce?

16:55.401 --> 16:57.068
Maybe you should
get down there.

17:03.008 --> 17:04.809
Where is my negotiator?

17:04.844 --> 17:06.211
I don't think
it'll matter.

17:06.244 --> 17:07.345
We're from the ICC.

17:07.378 --> 17:09.848
One of my team members
is in there.

17:09.882 --> 17:11.249
The cop is one of yours?

17:11.282 --> 17:13.484
The wanker in charge
is called Alex Vaughn.

17:13.519 --> 17:15.153
You can't trust him.

17:15.186 --> 17:17.321
This gets better all the time.

17:17.356 --> 17:19.924
Do you have a mobile
command post of some kind?

17:19.959 --> 17:22.794
It's being
set up now. Why?

17:22.828 --> 17:24.963
Because we shouldn't
be standing here.

17:24.997 --> 17:27.232
Don't look up, but they have
a sniper with them.

17:37.176 --> 17:40.512
You must be joking.

17:59.865 --> 18:01.457
All is good!

18:01.577 --> 18:02.500
See?

18:02.535 --> 18:04.714
I told you I had it all down.

18:04.834 --> 18:06.060
That is why I think it's fair

18:06.180 --> 18:08.370
to talk about
a larger remuneration.

18:08.490 --> 18:10.175
You want to renegotiate.

18:10.209 --> 18:12.043
Yeah, exactly, a renegotiation.

18:17.516 --> 18:20.919
Consider that our final offer.

18:20.953 --> 18:22.620
Wolf!

18:22.655 --> 18:24.889
Suits are here.

18:28.894 --> 18:29.894
Showtime.

18:33.003 --> 18:34.132
Police!

18:36.035 --> 18:37.343
He wants to talk to you!

18:37.463 --> 18:38.770
There is a picture...

18:38.890 --> 18:41.298
No, no...
ah! Ah!

18:41.418 --> 18:43.341
Hey, hey, hey!
Be gentle with her!

18:43.375 --> 18:44.242
She's pregnant!

18:44.276 --> 18:46.344
Be gentle, please.

18:46.379 --> 18:48.179
Are you okay?

18:48.214 --> 18:49.881
Okay.
Be gentle, please.

18:49.915 --> 18:51.916
Okay, it's procedure.
You're going to be fine, okay?

18:51.951 --> 18:53.184
Trust me.

18:53.219 --> 18:54.552
Give me the phone.

18:54.587 --> 18:57.255
You're going to be fine.

19:01.994 --> 19:03.595
This is Chief Helstrom.

19:03.629 --> 19:05.363
<i>Oh, yes,</i>
<i>we know who you are, Robert.</i>

19:05.398 --> 19:07.031
<i>We are very well prepared.</i>

19:07.066 --> 19:08.600
You'll be getting
a list of demands soon.

19:08.634 --> 19:11.269
And in case you're thinking
of trying something,

19:11.303 --> 19:12.370
what you're looking at

19:12.405 --> 19:13.671
is only a small amount
of what we brought.

19:13.706 --> 19:15.907
<i>We have</i>
<i>enough explosive in here</i>

19:15.941 --> 19:17.175
to level three blocks.

19:17.209 --> 19:19.080
Am I making myself clear?

19:20.679 --> 19:24.249
Why aren't they leaving?

19:24.283 --> 19:27.318
Because this isn't a robbery.

19:27.353 --> 19:28.553
It isn't?

19:28.587 --> 19:30.221
They've been
in the vault 20 minutes,

19:30.256 --> 19:31.456
and almost every bag
they brought with them

19:31.490 --> 19:33.558
is right there on the floor.

19:33.592 --> 19:35.093
What do you mean?

19:35.127 --> 19:37.529
They haven't taken any money.

19:37.563 --> 19:40.064
Are there any guns
hidden here, anywhere?

19:40.099 --> 19:41.633
Guns? Um...

19:41.667 --> 19:43.935
There's a security office
in the back corner,

19:43.969 --> 19:46.137
but I don't know
what's in there.

19:48.507 --> 19:49.541
Okay, look, I'm a cop.

19:49.575 --> 19:50.542
You are?

19:50.576 --> 19:52.410
And if the opportunity
presents itself,

19:52.445 --> 19:54.612
I may need you to divert them.

19:54.647 --> 19:56.114
No, he said he would
kill everyone...

19:56.148 --> 19:58.016
Anika, look,
they wired the front door

19:58.050 --> 19:59.017
with explosives,

19:59.051 --> 20:00.251
and they're walking around here

20:00.286 --> 20:01.252
without their masks on.

20:01.287 --> 20:02.053
Whatever they're doing,

20:02.088 --> 20:03.188
they're not going through it

20:03.222 --> 20:05.457
to leave 20 witnesses
to talk to sketch artists.

20:05.491 --> 20:06.558
Oh, no...

20:06.592 --> 20:08.660
Now, I may not get the chance,

20:08.694 --> 20:12.063
but if I do,
I'll need your help.

20:12.098 --> 20:13.264
Can you do that for me,

20:13.299 --> 20:15.533
Anika who pretends
she isn't the one

20:15.568 --> 20:18.136
who's running this place?

20:26.723 --> 20:30.072
Look, I want every man
on duty down here now!

20:32.488 --> 20:33.811
I was wrong.

20:33.931 --> 20:36.192
They're not just
wankers with guns.

20:36.312 --> 20:39.510
Nope.
They're wankers with bombs.

20:39.630 --> 20:41.524
Yeah. We'll help
where we can.

20:41.559 --> 20:43.827
PETN is as volatile as it gets.

20:43.861 --> 20:45.795
They're definitely not
coming out of the front door.

20:45.830 --> 20:47.831
I'm thinking maybe
I should get up high,

20:47.865 --> 20:49.699
try and locate their sniper.

20:49.733 --> 20:52.702
Keep my eye on him.

20:52.736 --> 20:54.437
All right, good idea.

20:54.472 --> 20:56.739
Okay, good.

21:02.813 --> 21:04.614
You are ready?

21:04.648 --> 21:05.748
Ready?

21:07.585 --> 21:09.980
Louis did not tell you
I was coming.

21:10.100 --> 21:11.121
No.

21:11.155 --> 21:12.322
My apologies, Rebecca.

21:12.356 --> 21:13.189
May we come in?

21:13.224 --> 21:14.357
Yeah.

21:17.862 --> 21:20.197
We need you
to come back to The Hague.

21:20.830 --> 21:22.039
Why?

21:22.159 --> 21:23.700
May I explain on the way?

21:26.637 --> 21:27.604
Damage nothing,

21:27.638 --> 21:29.239
but be extremely thorough.

21:29.273 --> 21:30.740
Always.

22:07.511 --> 22:10.547
They've wired
some of the doors with PETN.

22:10.581 --> 22:11.614
<i>There's a lot of that</i>

22:11.649 --> 22:13.483
on the open market lately.

22:13.517 --> 22:15.318
<i>It's the ordnance of choice</i>
<i>for terrorists.</i>

22:15.352 --> 22:17.287
Explosives
don't help them get away.

22:17.321 --> 22:19.522
<i>It only keeps us outside.</i>

22:19.557 --> 22:21.291
I'm going through
the city planning schematics

22:21.325 --> 22:23.069
to see if there is
anything nearby

22:23.189 --> 22:24.794
they could be accessing
for an escape.

22:24.829 --> 22:27.964
Listen, if you find anything,
let me know, okay?

22:27.998 --> 22:29.432
<i>- Will do.</i>
<i>- Thanks.</i>

22:29.466 --> 22:30.567
One
of the hostages

22:30.601 --> 22:32.635
is definitely a cop, unit ten.

22:32.670 --> 22:33.837
Excuse me...

22:33.871 --> 22:35.987
Did you just broadcast that?

22:36.440 --> 22:37.740
I'm gone.

22:37.775 --> 22:38.841
What are you doing?

22:38.876 --> 22:40.543
I said I'd pull out
if anything went wrong.

22:40.578 --> 22:42.439
- What went wrong?
- I can't say.

22:42.559 --> 22:43.713
I need an eye
in the sky for this.

22:43.747 --> 22:44.781
Well, send the pig.

22:44.815 --> 22:45.849
Pig's got
his own role to play...

22:45.883 --> 22:46.850
Look!

22:46.884 --> 22:47.917
I'm sorry, all right?

22:47.952 --> 22:49.219
But as soon as
everything's ready here,

22:49.253 --> 22:51.020
I'm going my own way.

22:57.261 --> 22:58.785
Want me
to take care of tiger?

22:58.905 --> 23:00.763
No, he'll come round.

23:00.798 --> 23:02.232
Wolf...

23:02.266 --> 23:03.566
I need to tell you something.

23:03.601 --> 23:04.367
Not now.

23:04.401 --> 23:05.835
Yes, now.

23:05.870 --> 23:09.672
We seem to have
an uninvited guest.

23:12.009 --> 23:14.277
It seems I have...

23:16.046 --> 23:20.384
painted myself
in a rather dangerous corner.

23:20.504 --> 23:21.851
Is there anything I can do?

23:21.886 --> 23:22.752
I don't think so.

23:22.786 --> 23:24.647
I mean, you haven't told anyone

23:24.767 --> 23:29.206
about my hunting for the man who
put the bomb in your garage, have you?

23:29.326 --> 23:30.860
What does that have to do with

23:30.895 --> 23:33.463
this corner you've painted
yourself into?

23:33.497 --> 23:35.498
I believe I am on the trail

23:35.533 --> 23:38.004
of the man who ordered
the bomb to be planted.

23:38.124 --> 23:42.672
Last week in Russia,
I was very close to him.

23:42.706 --> 23:44.274
He knew I was coming.

23:44.308 --> 23:46.776
And what do you...

23:52.716 --> 23:56.944
If there are any bugs,
that man will find them.

24:00.991 --> 24:02.812
How long
have they been listening?

24:02.932 --> 24:03.893
I assure you,

24:03.928 --> 24:05.829
they will only
have been listening

24:05.863 --> 24:08.565
for talk of the investigation.

24:08.599 --> 24:09.799
They will not be concerned

24:09.834 --> 24:11.500
with things
of a personal nature.

24:11.620 --> 24:13.349
Are you talking about
sex, Michel?

24:13.469 --> 24:15.490
Because there are
a good many things

24:15.610 --> 24:16.973
"of a personal nature"

24:17.007 --> 24:19.008
that go on in a marriage

24:19.043 --> 24:21.544
that don't involve sex.

24:22.813 --> 24:24.905
But then, you wouldn't
know about that, would you?

24:26.347 --> 24:28.972
I didn't mean to minimize
the intrusion, Rebecca.

24:29.007 --> 24:31.408
I remember the first case

24:31.442 --> 24:36.246
I brought to you
as a prosecutor.

24:36.281 --> 24:38.282
It laid the groundwork

24:38.316 --> 24:42.119
for establishing rape
as a crime of genocide.

24:42.153 --> 24:44.922
You took
those Tutsi women aside

24:44.956 --> 24:46.924
and you told them
not to be angry,

24:46.958 --> 24:48.926
that anger
would hurt their case,

24:48.960 --> 24:52.930
that personal anger would cloud
every aspect of the trial.

24:52.964 --> 24:54.064
Do you remember?

24:54.098 --> 24:55.332
I remember.

24:57.353 --> 24:59.369
I need you

24:59.404 --> 25:03.907
to not take personally
what these men did.

25:03.942 --> 25:06.376
They listened to us...

25:06.411 --> 25:08.345
to us talk,

25:08.379 --> 25:10.380
to us hold each other,

25:10.415 --> 25:12.916
to us crying.

25:12.951 --> 25:15.953
These animals,
they took my son away,

25:15.987 --> 25:18.422
and then they took my grief.

25:18.456 --> 25:21.325
They've left me nothing.

25:21.359 --> 25:23.894
Did you find the sniper?

25:25.363 --> 25:27.197
No.

25:27.231 --> 25:29.166
Doesn't mean
he isn't around, though,

25:29.200 --> 25:31.935
so tell everyone to stay
as unexposed as possible.

25:35.173 --> 25:36.139
Yes?

25:36.174 --> 25:38.809
I want six Porsches
lined up outside,

25:38.843 --> 25:40.477
all black.

25:40.511 --> 25:42.312
And I want one pilot
and a Gulfstream

25:42.347 --> 25:44.815
ready to go
at Rotterdam Airport,

25:44.849 --> 25:46.383
Amsterdam Airport Schiphol,

25:46.417 --> 25:47.584
Antwerp International,

25:47.619 --> 25:49.152
and Gilze-Rijen Airport.

25:49.187 --> 25:50.153
Is that clear?

25:50.188 --> 25:52.823
You want six Porsches
and four planes?

25:52.857 --> 25:53.991
<i>Not planes,</i>

25:54.025 --> 25:56.059
Gulfstreams.

25:56.094 --> 25:58.428
And you have one hour,

25:58.463 --> 26:00.998
or I'm turning this bank
into an abattoir,

26:01.032 --> 26:04.301
starting with the cop
we have amongst our hostages.

26:09.419 --> 26:11.430
How did they find out?

26:12.122 --> 26:14.946
Eva said a uniform
broadcast it on the radio.

26:15.066 --> 26:16.713
They must be listening.

26:16.833 --> 26:17.575
What's that?

26:17.695 --> 26:19.695
Security-camera footage.

26:19.729 --> 26:22.202
Wish they hadn't
disabled them so quickly.

26:22.322 --> 26:24.489
I want to see what happened
before they entered.

26:24.609 --> 26:25.302
Before?

26:25.422 --> 26:27.322
Hickman said there were
six of them, right?

26:27.357 --> 26:28.490
Only five came in.

26:28.525 --> 26:29.792
So, one was already inside.

26:29.826 --> 26:30.859
I'm not Hickman,

26:30.894 --> 26:32.895
but something made him
suspicious enough

26:32.929 --> 26:34.830
to dial you.

26:34.864 --> 26:36.165
Let's see if I can find it.

26:36.199 --> 26:38.867
Which one of you is a cop?

26:45.598 --> 26:47.276
I'm not big
on repeating myself,

26:47.310 --> 26:48.510
but this is important,

26:48.545 --> 26:50.846
so one more time.

26:50.880 --> 26:52.948
Which one of you is a cop?

26:54.984 --> 26:57.853
My money's on you, daddy to be.

26:57.887 --> 26:59.388
No, I'm a brick-layer.

26:59.422 --> 27:01.356
No one else fits the bill.
Come on, sport, on your feet.

27:01.391 --> 27:02.391
- Admit it.
- No...

27:02.425 --> 27:03.425
- Admit it!
- Please!

27:03.459 --> 27:04.460
Look at you, copper haircut,

27:04.494 --> 27:05.727
copper clothes...

27:05.762 --> 27:07.763
There's a copper in those eyes!
Admit it!

27:07.797 --> 27:09.467
No, it's him!

27:15.872 --> 27:18.807
I'm sorry.

27:18.842 --> 27:20.376
The cripple?

27:20.410 --> 27:22.812
Bloody scraping the barrel

27:22.932 --> 27:23.785
for cops, huh?

27:23.905 --> 27:25.592
He can't even hold a phone.

27:26.816 --> 27:29.351
Did you search him?

27:29.386 --> 27:31.720
You told me...
You said to get the phones...

27:31.754 --> 27:33.922
Get him on his feet
and search him.

27:44.367 --> 27:46.402
Hmm...

27:46.436 --> 27:48.570
What's this?

27:48.605 --> 27:50.672
I was working with
the Dutch police on a drug ring.

27:50.707 --> 27:53.242
That was confiscated
from someone this morning.

27:53.276 --> 27:54.510
It's police procedure
to walk around

27:54.544 --> 27:56.278
with evidence in your pocket?

27:56.312 --> 27:57.980
It was a seize
and destroy operation.

27:58.014 --> 28:00.849
Oh, and you just forgot
the destroy part?

28:00.884 --> 28:02.484
It's not your work,
it's your works, baby.

28:02.519 --> 28:03.952
Some cop.
A crippled junkie.

28:03.987 --> 28:05.554
A junkie with stones,
I'll give you that,

28:05.588 --> 28:07.556
but a junkie nonetheless.

28:07.590 --> 28:11.493
No, no, no, he isn't capable
of being a problem for us,

28:11.528 --> 28:13.896
and I never would have guessed
it was him

28:13.930 --> 28:15.063
without you.

28:15.098 --> 28:17.533
You know what that means,
don't you, sweetheart?

28:17.567 --> 28:19.501
It means you're a grass!

28:19.536 --> 28:20.936
A stoolie! An informant!

28:20.970 --> 28:22.905
And there's nothing I hate
more than a grass!

28:26.709 --> 28:28.777
Get some rope and cut it.

28:32.048 --> 28:35.984
You're making a mistake.

28:36.019 --> 28:38.787
Pig, give me your gun.

28:44.594 --> 28:46.995
I might have something.

28:47.030 --> 28:48.430
<i>Tell us.</i>

28:48.465 --> 28:51.633
There's an old sewer system
that runs right under the bank.

28:51.668 --> 28:52.968
It hasn't been used for years.

28:53.002 --> 28:54.036
It's unstable,

28:54.070 --> 28:55.437
but that's probably
how they're leaving.

28:55.472 --> 28:57.473
Any idea where it comes out?

28:57.507 --> 28:58.640
<i>Everywhere.</i>

28:58.675 --> 29:00.642
<i>But most of the exits</i>
<i>are sealed permanently.</i>

29:00.677 --> 29:03.045
<i>I'm narrowing down</i>
<i>to any possible escape routes.</i>

29:05.882 --> 29:07.649
It's only been 30 minutes!

29:07.684 --> 29:08.650
<i>I'm coming out.</i>

29:08.685 --> 29:09.618
<i>And I'm not alone,</i>

29:09.652 --> 29:10.686
<i>so you'd better</i>
<i>not try anything!</i>

29:10.720 --> 29:11.854
Yeah.

29:11.888 --> 29:12.988
Everyone is here.

29:13.022 --> 29:15.633
I want every
man and woman on duty

29:15.753 --> 29:16.625
down here now!

29:17.594 --> 29:19.695
Every man and woman on duty...

29:29.906 --> 29:31.607
Tell them not
to shoot, chief!

29:31.641 --> 29:33.542
That's not the bank robber!
That's not Vaughn!

29:33.576 --> 29:34.643
Are you sure?

29:34.677 --> 29:36.411
The robbers just want to
keep everybody busy.

29:36.446 --> 29:37.913
Tell your officers
to stand down!

29:37.947 --> 29:40.415
One bullet could
blow us all away.

29:40.450 --> 29:42.757
You need to think about
what you're doing.

29:42.877 --> 29:43.535
Shut up.

29:43.655 --> 29:44.654
You've been screwed.

29:44.774 --> 29:46.622
I said, shut up.

29:46.656 --> 29:48.457
All right, clear
back, come back.

29:48.491 --> 29:51.026
Everybody, stand down
and clear back. Clear back!

29:51.061 --> 29:52.728
Answer one question.

29:52.762 --> 29:54.496
Why did wolf take your gun?

29:54.531 --> 29:58.100
He said he needed
your gun, right?

29:58.134 --> 29:59.835
Why?

29:59.869 --> 30:01.637
To tape.

30:01.671 --> 30:04.173
He could have taped
any gun to that guy's hand.

30:13.450 --> 30:15.651
It's okay.
Don't move.

30:17.187 --> 30:18.821
It's gonna be all right.

30:18.855 --> 30:21.023
Yeah?

30:21.057 --> 30:22.791
There's no timer...

30:22.826 --> 30:23.992
Only a detonation cord.

30:24.027 --> 30:25.894
Is it attached
to a remote device?

30:25.929 --> 30:27.996
<i>Pulling out the cord</i>
<i>will defuse the bomb,</i>

30:28.031 --> 30:30.165
but there may be people
watching from inside.

30:30.200 --> 30:31.433
Watching?

30:32.902 --> 30:35.402
For someone to get close.

30:36.706 --> 30:39.475
Where's your security guard,
your inside man?

30:40.617 --> 30:41.671
I'm guessing

30:41.930 --> 30:44.680
that fox stabbed him with
the knife that she gave you.

30:44.714 --> 30:46.973
He's probably dead, right?

30:47.093 --> 30:48.990
And you're holding
the murder weapon.

30:50.920 --> 30:52.921
Okay.

30:52.956 --> 30:55.691
I'm going to remove the cord.

30:55.725 --> 30:57.793
I want you both still.

30:57.827 --> 30:59.595
Your prints are on the guns
that are left.

30:59.629 --> 31:00.996
Your prints are on the knife.

31:01.030 --> 31:02.564
Your prints are on
the explosive vest

31:02.599 --> 31:03.565
that was on the manager,

31:03.600 --> 31:05.901
the pieces that
are laying out there.

31:05.935 --> 31:07.636
Your prints are on the vests

31:07.670 --> 31:08.537
with the people
outside right now,

31:08.571 --> 31:10.005
the vests that they're wearing.

31:10.039 --> 31:11.140
And if you press that button,

31:11.174 --> 31:13.609
your prints are gonna be
on that detonator, too.

31:19.616 --> 31:21.216
They're long gone,

31:21.251 --> 31:22.885
and they've dumped
this whole thing

31:22.919 --> 31:25.187
right in your lap.

31:31.961 --> 31:34.630
All of them had gloves on...

31:34.664 --> 31:36.899
except you.

31:40.270 --> 31:42.037
He was my friend.

32:08.598 --> 32:10.065
<i>A lot of great big bags</i>

32:10.100 --> 32:13.502
<i>to bring to a robbery...</i>

32:16.306 --> 32:17.873
Sebastian!

32:17.907 --> 32:21.009
I'm running a suspect
through facial recognition.

32:21.044 --> 32:22.544
How many are there?

32:22.579 --> 32:24.213
Six.
Five men, one woman.

32:24.247 --> 32:25.814
Did you see a man
with one glove?

32:25.849 --> 32:27.116
The American?

32:27.150 --> 32:28.987
They know he's a cop.

32:31.721 --> 32:33.155
It's not a bank robbery.

32:33.189 --> 32:35.524
<i>Anne-Marie identified</i>
<i>one of the robbers.</i>

32:35.558 --> 32:36.692
Her husband is in a prison

32:36.726 --> 32:38.026
that sits right on top of
the old sewer system

32:38.061 --> 32:39.317
less than a mile away.

32:39.437 --> 32:40.857
Head for Scheveningen Prison.

32:40.977 --> 32:42.564
<i>We're sending you coordinates.</i>

32:42.599 --> 32:43.565
We'll explain to you
as you're on the way.

32:43.600 --> 32:45.167
Go. Go!

32:45.201 --> 32:46.939
We'll call you from the road.

32:52.842 --> 32:54.895
- Berger.
<i>- Sebastian?</i>

32:55.015 --> 32:56.851
Hickman? Are you okay?

32:56.971 --> 32:58.763
The bank's secure.
I've got one in custody.

32:58.798 --> 33:00.932
- He surrendered.
<i>- Surrendered?</i>

33:00.966 --> 33:02.914
Yeah, I can be very persuasive.

33:03.034 --> 33:04.345
But the doors are wired
and ready to blow.

33:04.486 --> 33:05.424
Tell whoever's outside,

33:05.544 --> 33:07.159
do not come in
without a bomb squad.

33:07.279 --> 33:09.190
Pretty sure they dug a tunnel.

33:09.224 --> 33:10.937
Any idea what's under this bank?

33:11.057 --> 33:12.186
<i>An old sewer line</i>

33:12.306 --> 33:14.028
<i>that leads</i>
<i>under a nearby prison.</i>

33:14.063 --> 33:15.597
<i>We think that's where</i>
<i>they are going.</i>

33:15.631 --> 33:18.395
I doubt this cell
is going to work underground.

33:18.515 --> 33:19.935
Do you think you can track it?

33:20.055 --> 33:21.573
<i>Any chance</i>
<i>i can get you not to go?</i>

33:21.693 --> 33:22.546
None.

33:53.004 --> 33:54.987
The female robbers' name
is Sheila Ganz.

33:55.107 --> 33:57.605
<i>her husband, Konrad Ganz,</i>
<i>doing 25 to life,</i>

33:57.725 --> 33:58.958
<i>was just transferred there.</i>

33:58.992 --> 34:00.960
The old sewer line goes
right underneath that prison.

34:00.995 --> 34:04.266
<i>And Ganz was Alex Vaughn's</i>
<i>cell mate in the U.K.</i>

34:09.036 --> 34:11.771
It's here.
We're under the prison.

34:18.344 --> 34:21.313
Give it to me!

34:21.348 --> 34:23.851
Okay...
Down.

34:44.004 --> 34:45.339
You all right, mate?

34:48.609 --> 34:51.964
Hey, hey, plenty of time
for that later, eh? Come on.

35:19.540 --> 35:20.440
This is the one.

35:28.415 --> 35:29.916
Hey, keep it down,
keep it down. Quiet.

35:29.950 --> 35:30.850
This is it.

35:30.884 --> 35:32.952
Just keep moving.

35:38.692 --> 35:40.059
Quiet, keep it down.

35:40.094 --> 35:41.327
Should be about another
100 yards...

35:41.361 --> 35:42.328
Come on...

35:42.363 --> 35:43.730
Guys.

35:43.764 --> 35:45.965
Hickman's stopped.

35:45.999 --> 35:48.034
He's at first Avenue
and Holmgren.

35:48.068 --> 35:49.669
<i>Yeah, we're only</i>
<i>a few blocks from there.</i>

35:49.703 --> 35:51.838
Come on, come on, come on.

35:51.872 --> 35:52.805
What's he doing?

35:52.840 --> 35:54.507
He's still at that same spot,

35:54.541 --> 35:55.842
signaling us that
something is happening.

36:04.418 --> 36:05.385
Okay,
you go to the sewers.

36:05.419 --> 36:06.452
I'll stay here.

36:09.790 --> 36:11.591
Up already?

36:13.794 --> 36:14.994
Don't move!

36:15.029 --> 36:16.832
Keep your hands
where I can see them.

36:16.952 --> 36:18.064
Game's up.

36:18.184 --> 36:19.345
You're on your own. Run.

36:19.465 --> 36:20.455
Run!

36:26.566 --> 36:27.516
Stop!

36:27.636 --> 36:29.316
Down! Down! Down!

36:29.436 --> 36:31.044
On your knees now!

36:31.078 --> 36:31.944
Knees!

36:35.749 --> 36:37.538
Far enough!

36:39.453 --> 36:40.453
You?

36:40.487 --> 36:42.488
Me.

36:44.158 --> 36:45.925
How the hell did you
get away from pig?

36:45.959 --> 36:48.494
I helped him realize
what a mess you left him in.

36:48.529 --> 36:50.430
I should have killed you
when I had the chance.

36:50.464 --> 36:51.898
Probably.

36:51.932 --> 36:53.032
I'm still going to.

36:53.067 --> 36:54.534
Drop the weapon.

36:54.568 --> 36:56.783
How did that happen, the hand?

36:56.903 --> 36:57.937
Birth defect.

36:57.971 --> 36:59.171
Yeah...

36:59.194 --> 37:00.073
No, no, no,

37:00.107 --> 37:01.874
they would have never let you
be a cop with that.

37:01.909 --> 37:03.776
What was it, line of duty?

37:03.811 --> 37:05.672
I'm not going to ask again
to drop that gun.

37:05.792 --> 37:07.781
Were you a junkie
before you got hurt,

37:07.901 --> 37:08.964
or is that all post-wound?

37:09.084 --> 37:10.450
I'm not a junkie.

37:14.488 --> 37:17.557
What the hell was
a crippled American cop doing

37:17.591 --> 37:19.092
in a bank in the Netherlands?

37:19.126 --> 37:21.494
Playing John Wayne.

37:25.699 --> 37:27.200
All right!

37:27.234 --> 37:28.868
All right, all right,
all right, you got me.

37:28.903 --> 37:30.737
You got me, you got me.

37:32.473 --> 37:33.873
That was...

37:33.907 --> 37:34.841
pretty impressive.

37:34.875 --> 37:36.142
Shot the gun out of his hand.

37:36.176 --> 37:39.145
Yeah, well, I was aiming
for his head.

37:39.179 --> 37:41.681
I told you,
I'm not left-handed.

37:43.650 --> 37:46.552
<i>Unit four,</i>
<i>we have five in custody.</i>

37:46.587 --> 37:47.987
<i>We were told there were six.</i>

37:57.231 --> 37:59.699
Was he one of them?

38:03.971 --> 38:06.472
No.

38:06.507 --> 38:08.708
You sure?

38:22.122 --> 38:23.189
I'm out of here, Louis.

38:23.223 --> 38:24.724
Are you shooting up?

38:27.261 --> 38:29.262
I need to know.

38:31.031 --> 38:31.831
It's a numbing agent.

38:31.865 --> 38:32.999
It's called Lidocaine.

38:33.033 --> 38:34.200
I shoot it into my hand.

38:34.234 --> 38:35.835
I tried the pills,
but you know what?

38:35.869 --> 38:37.770
They're just not strong enough.

38:37.805 --> 38:39.250
Are you sure?

38:39.370 --> 38:42.008
Am I sure?

38:48.582 --> 38:50.616
So now he's shooting up.

38:53.220 --> 38:54.554
Don't worry.

38:54.588 --> 38:56.022
My name is on this team,

38:56.056 --> 38:57.290
my reputation.

38:57.324 --> 38:59.926
I'll take care of it, Dorn.

39:02.162 --> 39:04.130
They found
three listening devices

39:04.164 --> 39:05.565
in your flat.

39:08.168 --> 39:09.135
Did you remove them?

39:09.169 --> 39:11.628
No, of course,
I did not remove them.

39:12.072 --> 39:13.306
We will use them

39:13.340 --> 39:15.241
to deliver information
to Dimitrov

39:15.275 --> 39:16.309
that we want him to have.

39:16.343 --> 39:17.543
It's the best weapon.

39:18.087 --> 39:19.119
Rebecca will never...

39:19.239 --> 39:20.740
You think of Rebecca now?

39:20.860 --> 39:21.714
Now?

39:23.117 --> 39:25.918
You did not call her, Louis.

39:25.953 --> 39:28.788
You didn't warn her that
I was coming instead of you,

39:28.822 --> 39:30.323
that I was coming
with a technician,

39:30.357 --> 39:31.924
that any of this was happening.

39:31.959 --> 39:32.959
Where is she?

39:32.993 --> 39:36.262
I-I don't know.

39:39.900 --> 39:41.334
Has anyone seen my wife?

39:41.368 --> 39:42.669
She just left.

39:42.703 --> 39:43.670
She left?

39:43.704 --> 39:45.872
About
10 minutes ago.

39:50.681 --> 39:51.907
You're not coming?

39:52.027 --> 39:53.680
I'll pass tonight.

39:53.714 --> 39:54.814
Really?

39:54.848 --> 39:56.382
Aye.

39:57.885 --> 39:59.385
Good for you.

40:32.353 --> 40:33.653
Hello?

40:35.789 --> 40:36.823
Hi.

40:36.857 --> 40:38.358
Yeah, it's me.

40:38.392 --> 40:40.093
I'm fine.

40:40.127 --> 40:41.327
I'm fine!

40:41.362 --> 40:43.896
Just listen.

40:43.931 --> 40:46.332
I need you to, um...

40:48.168 --> 40:51.104
I saw Colin today.

40:51.138 --> 40:52.138
Aye.

40:52.172 --> 40:55.241
I need you to tell him
that I saw him.

40:55.275 --> 40:59.412
No, he'll know what I mean.

40:59.446 --> 41:02.081
All right? And I need you
to tell him to call me.

41:02.116 --> 41:04.650
I want to speak to him.

41:04.685 --> 41:06.219
Can you do that?

41:07.721 --> 41:10.123
Love you, ma.

41:11.125 --> 41:14.193
All right.
