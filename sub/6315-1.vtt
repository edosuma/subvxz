00:41.156 --> 00:45.393
Woah, woah, new idea.

00:45.427 --> 00:48.162
You surrender to me.

00:51.465 --> 00:53.467
It's just one option.

00:53.501 --> 00:55.235
But what if instead of that, you run home

00:55.269 --> 00:57.470
to the city, and on your way you tell

00:57.504 --> 01:00.107
all the other scout teams that I died.

01:00.141 --> 01:01.375
That will put me at ease.

01:01.409 --> 01:02.809
Just hand it over.

01:02.843 --> 01:04.345
Come on, what have you got?

01:04.379 --> 01:06.012
Don't you wanna live out here in this

01:06.046 --> 01:09.383
glorious Empire and serve The Nomads?

01:09.417 --> 01:10.318
(laughing)

01:10.352 --> 01:12.118
That's the deal Catherine made.

01:12.152 --> 01:13.687
(laughing)

01:13.721 --> 01:15.488
She's probably selling city secrets

01:15.522 --> 01:18.458
to The Nomad King in his bed right now!

01:18.492 --> 01:20.594
(laughing)

01:20.628 --> 01:26.133

01:37.244 --> 01:40.747
Scout Team Seven to Control,
Scout Team Seven to Control!

01:40.781 --> 01:42.249
[Control] Team Seven, what's your location?

01:42.283 --> 01:43.717
Nomad outpost!

01:43.751 --> 01:44.952
[Control] What's the situation?

01:44.986 --> 01:47.688
The situation's bad, we found Sol!

01:50.090 --> 01:51.291
- Scout down...
- [Control] Wait, wait,

01:51.325 --> 01:52.526
shut up, shut up, what's your situation?

01:52.560 --> 01:54.728
Scout down, request backup.

01:54.762 --> 01:58.065
[Control] Which outpost,
I need your exact location.

01:58.099 --> 01:59.833
Come in Team Ten, what's happening?

01:59.867 --> 02:01.735
Team... (crunch)

02:04.105 --> 02:06.174
(arm whirring)

02:10.344 --> 02:13.079
(powering down)

02:13.113 --> 02:15.181
(laughing)

02:15.215 --> 02:20.720
(music intensifies)

02:36.237 --> 02:37.905
You might wanna fix that arm.

02:37.939 --> 02:39.906
I don't need it to kill you.

02:50.017 --> 02:53.420
(laughing)

03:02.664 --> 03:05.399
[Scout] These Nomads were ruthless people.

03:05.433 --> 03:09.904
Mad like you, watch what they did.

03:09.938 --> 03:12.707
(laughing)

03:18.880 --> 03:23.351
(machine running)

03:42.269 --> 03:43.904
This is gonna hurt!

03:43.938 --> 03:46.207
(laughing)

03:48.208 --> 03:51.345
Turn it off, and I won't kill you.

03:51.379 --> 03:52.878
Really...

03:52.912 --> 03:57.417
If you slide this back in,
can that arm break that chain?

03:59.187 --> 04:02.223
(laughing)

04:06.927 --> 04:09.896
How bad is Sun Disease?

04:16.838 --> 04:18.071
I can't imagine this being the

04:18.105 --> 04:21.241
last face you see before you die.

04:21.274 --> 04:23.443
(laughing)

04:23.477 --> 04:26.080
What a horrible way to die.

04:26.114 --> 04:28.749
You know, I'm disappointed.

04:30.117 --> 04:33.920
They said you were clever and dangerous.

04:33.954 --> 04:37.090
(gasping)

04:52.639 --> 04:57.477
(banging, clanking)

05:03.684 --> 05:05.185
(crunch)

05:09.223 --> 05:14.728
(dramatic music)

05:24.872 --> 05:27.640
This is a horrible way to die.

05:35.984 --> 05:38.786
(phone ringing)

05:58.473 --> 05:59.239
Hello?

05:59.273 --> 06:00.874
[Caller] Who is this?

06:00.908 --> 06:02.141
I'm with Scout Team Seven...

06:02.175 --> 06:03.744
[Caller] One of the teams looking for Sol?

06:03.778 --> 06:04.912
Yes, but you shouldn't worry

06:04.946 --> 06:07.614
about him anymore, he isn't a problem.

06:07.648 --> 06:09.116
The mission was very successful.

06:09.150 --> 06:10.083
[Caller] Who is this?

06:10.117 --> 06:11.251
Do you know if there's any way

06:11.285 --> 06:14.054
to turn off the giant torture machine?

06:14.088 --> 06:15.256
A funny thing happened.

06:15.290 --> 06:16.956
[Caller] Cleo isn't there?

06:20.627 --> 06:24.064
Cleo, no, Cleo's away at the moment.

06:24.098 --> 06:25.266
So this machine...

06:25.300 --> 06:26.700
[Caller] You tell her the deal is off.

06:26.734 --> 06:29.602
(dial tone)

06:29.636 --> 06:30.770
That was the most useless

06:30.804 --> 06:32.705
conversation I've ever had in my life.

06:32.739 --> 06:35.509
(machine whirring)

06:37.412 --> 06:42.917
(tribal music)

06:44.518 --> 06:47.554
(laughing)

06:50.857 --> 06:53.660
Hello, hello?

06:57.532 --> 07:00.734
I don't suppose you know who that was.

07:00.768 --> 07:01.934
What did they say?

07:01.968 --> 07:03.102
Can I have some assistance?

07:03.136 --> 07:05.071
Maybe, answer my question.

07:05.105 --> 07:07.340
Ahhh!

07:07.374 --> 07:10.311
They asked for Cleo and
said the deal was off.

07:10.345 --> 07:14.013
Not much of a
conversationalist, are you Cleo?

07:14.047 --> 07:15.215
You stole my call!

07:15.249 --> 07:16.616
Half the world's dead, look where we are,

07:16.650 --> 07:19.153
and I get my call stolen?

07:19.187 --> 07:20.087
What are the odds?

07:20.121 --> 07:21.020
Perhaps they're regrettably

07:21.054 --> 07:22.956
higher than you might expect.

07:22.990 --> 07:24.258
This is just funny.

07:24.292 --> 07:27.261
Ahhh, I fail to see the humor, Senorita.

07:27.295 --> 07:29.429
Can you hand me that bolt over there?

07:31.532 --> 07:33.400
What are you supposed to be?

07:33.434 --> 07:36.804
Please give me the bolt, it's right there.

07:36.838 --> 07:40.241
Just hand me that bolt, get
the bolt, please, right there.

07:44.312 --> 07:46.446
You've got Sun Disease.

07:46.480 --> 07:47.915
Why didn't you protect your eyes?

07:47.949 --> 07:49.350
You must not be from around here.

07:49.384 --> 07:52.886
Just kick the bolt in my direction!

07:52.920 --> 07:55.455
It's looks like you've got
steel in there, that's rare.

07:55.489 --> 07:57.724
Did someone from Paradise
City make that for you?

07:57.758 --> 08:01.761
Ahhh, lady, give me the bolt!

08:01.795 --> 08:03.931
Well for that we'll have
to work out an exchange.

08:03.965 --> 08:07.234
Afraid I don't do favors
for inconsiderate people.

08:08.502 --> 08:09.970
I apologize for skipping the social

08:10.004 --> 08:11.571
niceties of introductions, I would

08:11.605 --> 08:13.374
love to learn more about
you, you seem like a

08:13.408 --> 08:16.109
very interesting person, but if you don't

08:16.143 --> 08:18.778
give me that bolt, I'm going to die!

08:18.812 --> 08:20.381
Well obviously you're gonna die.

08:20.415 --> 08:22.715
Horrifically from the looks of things.

08:22.749 --> 08:23.717
How can a bolt help you?

08:23.751 --> 08:25.085
I'll show you!

08:25.119 --> 08:27.521
(creaking)

08:36.363 --> 08:38.131
What will you trade me for it?

08:38.164 --> 08:41.235
Maybe you can tell me how to
find your friend from Paradise.

08:41.269 --> 08:43.236
Ahhhh!

08:43.270 --> 08:46.839
(banging, clanking)

08:49.077 --> 08:51.011
I came from Paradise.

08:51.045 --> 08:53.112
I can get you inside if you want.

08:53.146 --> 08:54.113
You're from Paradise?

08:54.147 --> 08:55.616
Yeah.

08:55.650 --> 08:57.450
Huh, how would you get me in?

08:57.484 --> 08:59.352
It's hidden, no one on the
outside knows how to find it.

08:59.386 --> 09:02.790
I do, I stole an access
card, I can give it to you.

09:02.824 --> 09:04.024
An access card?

09:04.058 --> 09:06.559
Ahhhh!

09:06.593 --> 09:08.429
It's a Presidential key.

09:08.463 --> 09:10.197
It opens any city gate,
you can walk right in.

09:10.231 --> 09:11.432
And right back out?

09:11.466 --> 09:13.500
Sure, what, are you planning a robbery?

09:13.534 --> 09:15.803
My plans really aren't your concern.

09:22.209 --> 09:24.444
(arm powering up)

09:29.983 --> 09:31.351
Impressive.

09:31.385 --> 09:35.756
Well thank you, lead on.

09:35.790 --> 09:37.658
(suspenseful music)

09:37.692 --> 09:40.260
(choking)

09:42.597 --> 09:45.299
(coughing)

09:49.936 --> 09:53.239
(grunting)

09:59.380 --> 10:02.282
(groaning)

10:20.968 --> 10:22.669
[Cleo] Give me the card.

10:22.703 --> 10:25.671
What can you trade me for it?

10:25.705 --> 10:26.839
A bullet.

10:26.873 --> 10:28.275
Listen Senorita, I don't usually

10:28.309 --> 10:30.743
kill women, but for you,
I might make an exception.

10:30.777 --> 10:32.445
(gunshot)

10:34.381 --> 10:35.748
That was your last shot, wasn't it?

10:35.782 --> 10:38.051
Would I still be standing here if it was?

10:39.352 --> 10:40.319
I don't know.

10:40.353 --> 10:41.521
Why is the card so important

10:41.555 --> 10:42.588
to you that you'd break our deal?

10:42.622 --> 10:43.756
I thought you'd be honorable.

10:43.790 --> 10:44.991
Honorable is just a word people

10:45.025 --> 10:46.592
give you when you do what they want.

10:46.626 --> 10:47.995
And I didn't promise you anything.

10:48.029 --> 10:50.264
(click)

10:50.298 --> 10:51.732
I can't give you the card because

10:51.766 --> 10:55.401
I need it to trade to The
Nomad King for a woman.

10:55.435 --> 10:56.370
Named Catherine.

10:56.404 --> 10:57.371
Who is she to you?

10:57.405 --> 10:58.939
Everything.

11:00.040 --> 11:01.741
What's Paradise to you?

11:01.775 --> 11:03.176
Everything.

11:03.210 --> 11:04.377
If you give the King an access card

11:04.411 --> 11:06.280
to the city, he'll go and destroy it.

11:06.314 --> 11:07.647
She's worth it.

11:07.681 --> 11:09.082
I don't help other people, Senorita,

11:09.116 --> 11:12.386
so either go away or kill me.

11:16.256 --> 11:18.091
Ooof, ahhh!

11:18.125 --> 11:20.693
(groaning)

11:20.727 --> 11:23.863
(machine whirring)

11:23.897 --> 11:27.133
(gasping, buzzing)

11:32.439 --> 11:34.407
We done with this fight now?

11:36.276 --> 11:38.711
(laughing)

11:40.448 --> 11:42.348
So, you clever enough to get Catherine

11:42.382 --> 11:44.050
without this, or will
you try to steal it back?

11:44.084 --> 11:45.318
Nah, it's yours.

11:45.352 --> 11:48.789
I can still get her, it'll just be harder.

11:51.324 --> 11:53.526
You know how to get to the King?

11:54.795 --> 11:56.163
Yeah.

11:56.197 --> 11:58.097
You show me how to get to him,

11:58.131 --> 12:00.033
I'll tell you how to get into Paradise.

12:00.067 --> 12:00.766
Deal?

12:00.800 --> 12:02.535
Deal.

12:02.569 --> 12:04.537
What's your name anyway?

12:08.943 --> 12:10.209
Sol.

12:10.243 --> 12:12.011
Nice to meet you.

12:14.381 --> 12:18.385
(action music)

12:18.419 --> 12:19.886
[Sol] If this is one of The Nomad Army's

12:19.920 --> 12:23.156
abandoned storage outposts,
why are we sneaking up to it?

12:24.291 --> 12:25.559
Are we supposed to be frightened

12:25.593 --> 12:27.995
of Warriors and Invisibles, and what else?

12:28.029 --> 12:29.496
Not... did you see that?

12:29.530 --> 12:31.365
Creatures.

12:32.433 --> 12:33.733
I didn't see anything.

12:33.767 --> 12:35.768
Yeah, well how reliable is your eyesight?

12:37.538 --> 12:40.073
Look, Sun Disease would drive me crazy.

12:40.107 --> 12:40.973
If every time I looked at other

12:41.007 --> 12:42.943
people's faces I saw my own?

12:42.977 --> 12:44.645
No thank you.

12:44.679 --> 12:46.780
Does it happen with everyone you look at?

12:46.814 --> 12:48.048
Do I look like you to you?

12:48.082 --> 12:50.016
Yes, everybody looks like me to me,

12:50.050 --> 12:53.185
but I can read your
face, you can't lie to me.

12:53.219 --> 12:54.353
I never lie.

12:54.387 --> 12:55.588
Are you up for this?

12:55.622 --> 12:57.323
Nobody can stop me from getting to her.

12:57.357 --> 12:58.858
Including Creatures.

12:58.892 --> 13:00.794
Ahhh!

13:00.828 --> 13:02.695
(snarling)

13:02.729 --> 13:04.197
[Sol] What the hell is
wrong with this individual?

13:04.231 --> 13:05.265
Cleo, shoot it!

13:05.299 --> 13:06.466
(arm powering down)

13:06.500 --> 13:07.467
Now!

13:07.501 --> 13:10.169
What, you're out of bullets?!

13:10.203 --> 13:11.438
You said you weren't out of bullets!

13:11.472 --> 13:12.371
I never said that!

13:12.405 --> 13:13.506
It was a direct implication.

13:13.540 --> 13:14.408
I thought you could read my face,

13:14.442 --> 13:15.309
you're an arrogant bastard.

13:15.343 --> 13:16.075
Oh don't you criticize me!

13:16.109 --> 13:16.977
Don't yell at me!

13:17.011 --> 13:17.644
I'm not yelling at you!

13:17.678 --> 13:19.379
Yes you are!

13:19.413 --> 13:23.116
(grunting, snarling)

13:30.024 --> 13:31.692
(snap)

13:39.934 --> 13:40.967
Some help you are.

13:41.001 --> 13:42.135
I don't believe this.

13:42.169 --> 13:43.303
You don't want to point a weapon

13:43.337 --> 13:44.237
at someone if you can't use it anyway.

13:44.271 --> 13:45.671
(arm powering up)

13:45.705 --> 13:46.673
You'd better listen to
me next time I tell you...

13:46.707 --> 13:48.474
(arm powering down)

13:48.508 --> 13:50.977
Don't do that.

13:51.011 --> 13:53.679
Why didn't you kill him? (arm powering up)

13:53.713 --> 13:55.147
He didn't know what he was doing.

13:55.181 --> 13:56.817
It isn't their fault, they're mad.

13:56.851 --> 13:58.017
The world is lonely and quiet enough,

13:58.051 --> 13:59.618
you don't need to take more out of it.

13:59.652 --> 14:01.154
Injury is great conflict resolution.

14:01.188 --> 14:03.023
Killing lasts longer.

14:04.391 --> 14:06.992
(dramatic sting)

14:07.026 --> 14:09.596
Get whatever you need and let's go.

14:09.630 --> 14:10.530
Unless you wanna fix your gun and

14:10.564 --> 14:12.900
point it at that guy for awhile.

14:14.101 --> 14:15.901
[Cleo] Hey, will you check
that Creature's pockets?

14:15.935 --> 14:17.504
See what he's got, they steal stuff.

14:17.538 --> 14:19.339
Why would he want anything?

14:21.375 --> 14:26.813
(dramatic music)

14:30.785 --> 14:33.819
Cleo, how attached are you
to your Creature theory?

14:33.853 --> 14:35.155
Because this is just a man in a mask.

14:35.189 --> 14:37.790
What does he look like?

14:37.824 --> 14:39.458
Handsome.

14:45.498 --> 14:47.134
You afraid or something?

14:47.168 --> 14:48.300
Some people I was friends with

14:48.334 --> 14:49.435
were taken by The King and turned

14:49.469 --> 14:51.370
into Creatures, he's not one of them.

14:58.878 --> 15:01.681
Would you consider this normal behavior?

15:03.450 --> 15:04.885
There are more Creatures out here,

15:04.919 --> 15:07.953
so maybe try not to get your
ass kicked next time, yeah?

15:07.987 --> 15:09.622
I did not get my...

15:09.656 --> 15:12.726
I'm breathing, he's not,
that's conflict resolution.

15:12.760 --> 15:14.995
I got a whole arm made
out of conflict resolution!

15:15.029 --> 15:16.963
(buzzing)

15:23.503 --> 15:27.674
What are you doing, we have to go.

15:27.708 --> 15:30.943
I am Lear, elite Junior
King of this outpost!

15:30.977 --> 15:32.545
Who dareth trespass?

15:32.579 --> 15:34.448
Oh great.

15:34.482 --> 15:36.382
If we don't fight him,
he'll follow us until we do.

15:36.416 --> 15:37.818
What don't you take care of this one, huh?

15:37.852 --> 15:39.619
(buzzing)

15:45.059 --> 15:47.660
[Lear] Who are you, who is that man there?

15:49.029 --> 15:51.798
Cleo, oh I've heard talk of you.

15:54.702 --> 15:56.001
They say you are a fortune that

15:56.035 --> 15:59.338
rivals the treasures of the Isle De Roca.

15:59.372 --> 16:00.506
You're a little behind the times.

16:00.540 --> 16:02.241
Madam, I demand your attention!

16:02.275 --> 16:03.943
From there, do not move, I am to

16:03.977 --> 16:06.847
be viewed from below or
from an inferior angle.

16:06.881 --> 16:08.682
Your hair suggests you believe

16:08.716 --> 16:11.318
in alternative hygienic standards.

16:11.352 --> 16:14.054
Your witticism lacks a definitive luster

16:14.088 --> 16:17.089
and the caliber of even
a lower class education.

16:17.123 --> 16:20.894
And the layout of your face,
on the whole, offends me.

16:20.928 --> 16:22.362
I shall therefore acquisit my rights

16:22.396 --> 16:25.698
as heir to the throne and
challenge you to a duel.

16:25.732 --> 16:27.700
It will be a mighty battle for me.

16:27.734 --> 16:30.336
For you, it will suck.

16:30.370 --> 16:32.171
The winner, in other words I, shall

16:32.205 --> 16:33.607
receive your treasure.

16:33.641 --> 16:35.641
The loser, shortly hereafter to

16:35.675 --> 16:38.911
be known forever as you, dies.

16:38.945 --> 16:41.515
(action music)

16:41.549 --> 16:46.218
And now we come to it, you
behold my mighty challenge!

16:54.661 --> 16:55.929
The Duke of Lear descends upon

16:55.963 --> 16:57.597
you with the fury of an army!

16:57.631 --> 17:00.199
Hey Sol, may I borrow you for a moment?

17:05.372 --> 17:08.675
Madam, I am protected
by powers of nobility.

17:08.709 --> 17:10.810
Now have at thee, you shoddy gnat!

17:10.844 --> 17:12.477
You pukish relic!

17:12.511 --> 17:13.412
Are you serious?

17:13.445 --> 17:15.848
Ha ha, oof!

17:17.518 --> 17:21.487
Foul play, madam, foul play.

17:21.521 --> 17:23.723
You lack an applicable skill set!

17:23.757 --> 17:26.560
My worst day is the peak
of your craftsmanship.

17:26.594 --> 17:29.396
Your ability is less than good.

17:29.430 --> 17:31.898
Ah, you swarthy dog!

17:33.867 --> 17:37.070
Embrace your forthcoming demise!

17:37.104 --> 17:39.339
No, back you... (mumble)
hither away from my ship!

17:39.373 --> 17:41.041
You know how long it took
me to get those suckers?

17:41.075 --> 17:42.976
A really long time!

17:46.780 --> 17:48.682
Amateur...

17:50.850 --> 17:52.952
A monumental error.

17:52.986 --> 17:54.487
Sol!

17:54.521 --> 17:55.889
(arm powering up)

17:55.923 --> 17:57.957
Oh those are pretty, yes, give.

17:57.991 --> 17:59.492
Sol!

18:02.162 --> 18:03.796
Oof!

18:03.830 --> 18:06.666
(screaming)

18:06.700 --> 18:08.735
[Cleo] Sol, don't kill him!

18:16.376 --> 18:17.811
Ahhh!

18:17.845 --> 18:20.012
[Cleo] Sol, no!

18:21.214 --> 18:24.984
(choking, snap)

18:35.495 --> 18:37.197
[Cleo] That was The Nomad King's cousin.

18:37.231 --> 18:39.966
He looked like just another asshole to me.

18:40.000 --> 18:41.066
I fixed my arm.

18:41.100 --> 18:42.502
Once he find out what you did,

18:42.536 --> 18:44.004
we'll have no chance of
getting to Catherine quietly.

18:44.038 --> 18:45.604
There are dead bodies all over the place.

18:45.638 --> 18:46.939
I had a few here and there, so what?

18:46.973 --> 18:48.274
So what?

18:48.308 --> 18:51.378
Maybe we were both better off alone.

18:51.412 --> 18:56.716
(dramatic music)

19:00.453 --> 19:01.787
Do you keep your promises?

19:01.821 --> 19:03.355
Of course.

19:03.389 --> 19:04.791
You're nothing in this world if you don't.

19:04.825 --> 19:07.160
Good, then you have to
take me to Catherine.

19:07.194 --> 19:08.194
We have to stay together.

19:08.228 --> 19:09.930
Why should I trust you?

19:14.934 --> 19:16.169
I don't care for the situation.

19:16.203 --> 19:17.670
Neither do I, but you're the only

19:17.704 --> 19:21.574
breathing person I know, and I'm lost.

19:28.448 --> 19:31.383
So this Catherine, she means a lot to you?

19:32.985 --> 19:34.419
You could say that.

19:34.453 --> 19:35.955
Good.

19:37.724 --> 19:40.827
Well guide, guide.

19:55.075 --> 19:55.975
Where are we going?

19:56.009 --> 19:57.543
[Cleo] We need better weapons.

19:57.577 --> 19:59.813
There's another outpost
not too far from here.

19:59.847 --> 20:01.548
A full armory.

20:03.117 --> 20:08.288
(enchanting music)

22:28.328 --> 22:30.028
You have no idea where
you're going, do you?

22:30.062 --> 22:33.232
No, there used to be an armory here.

22:35.135 --> 22:36.403
Stop!

22:39.873 --> 22:41.408
Woah...

22:43.844 --> 22:45.143
I cannot believe we walked into

22:45.177 --> 22:47.913
this without setting anything off.

22:47.947 --> 22:49.181
We were lucky.

22:49.215 --> 22:50.449
I'm sure they're all duds.

22:50.483 --> 22:52.185
You have no idea what you're talking about.

22:52.219 --> 22:54.519
I don't have any...

22:54.553 --> 22:57.957
Which one of us thinks that this is a bomb?

22:57.991 --> 22:59.425
Cleo?

23:00.961 --> 23:02.128
What are you doing?

23:02.162 --> 23:03.329
[Cleo] I want these.

23:03.363 --> 23:05.398
[Sol] Where could you possibly wear those?

23:05.432 --> 23:06.798
There's one main city left on Earth,

23:06.832 --> 23:09.502
it's hidden underground,
and no one goes out to eat!

23:09.536 --> 23:10.436
[Cleo] I like them, go to Hell.

23:10.470 --> 23:12.537
[Sol] You're being irrational!

23:12.571 --> 23:13.907
I am?

23:13.941 --> 23:15.073
You don't protect your prosthetic arm

23:15.107 --> 23:16.708
in the dirtiest part of the world?

23:16.742 --> 23:17.944
Yeah, that's irrational.

23:17.978 --> 23:20.480
It's not a prosthetic,
it's a deadly weapon.

23:23.684 --> 23:25.517
Ah, shit!

23:25.551 --> 23:27.519
That silly sword bitch broke my goggles.

23:27.553 --> 23:28.420
Keep your eyes closed.

23:28.454 --> 23:29.154
[Cleo] Yeah, thanks.

23:29.188 --> 23:30.456
Let me see.

23:30.490 --> 23:31.623
Let me see them!

23:31.657 --> 23:33.092
No, you break everything you touch.

23:33.126 --> 23:34.994
No I don't.

23:35.028 --> 23:37.229
Let me see them.

23:37.263 --> 23:38.698
(snap) Ah...

23:38.732 --> 23:39.731
What was that?

23:39.765 --> 23:43.102
Uh, your goggles made a noise.

23:43.136 --> 23:44.304
Wait, where are you going?

23:44.338 --> 23:46.738
Come back... look, we're
surrounded by bombs.

23:46.772 --> 23:47.640
Just don't move.

23:47.674 --> 23:48.908
(click)

23:48.942 --> 23:51.244
What was that, did you
just break my goggles?

23:51.278 --> 23:53.679
No, but I did happen to set off

23:53.713 --> 23:56.082
one of these extremely hazardous duds.

23:56.116 --> 23:58.450
Relax, nothing bad is going to happen.

23:58.484 --> 23:59.419
(clicking)

23:59.453 --> 24:01.821
(gasp)

24:01.855 --> 24:03.989
Oh shit, Cleo!

24:04.023 --> 24:09.228
(suspesenful music)

24:14.401 --> 24:15.969
(clicking stops)

24:19.306 --> 24:21.807
Sol?

24:21.841 --> 24:23.376
Sol?!

24:32.485 --> 24:34.020
Sol?!

24:41.895 --> 24:43.629
Oh come on!

24:43.663 --> 24:48.434
(suspenseful music)

25:45.992 --> 25:48.293
(grunting)

25:50.664 --> 25:54.099
[Sol] Cleo, Cleo, are you okay?

25:55.601 --> 25:58.370
(whirring, buzzing)

26:07.246 --> 26:08.412
Your eyes...

26:08.446 --> 26:09.348
You needed help.

26:09.382 --> 26:10.949
You shouldn't have done that.

26:10.983 --> 26:12.717
I can get out of this on my own.

26:12.751 --> 26:14.019
(grunting)

26:14.053 --> 26:15.654
Don't, stop struggling, it gets tighter

26:15.688 --> 26:17.523
every time you move,
you can't get out of it.

26:17.557 --> 26:19.891
Watch me.

26:19.925 --> 26:21.460
Stop it!

26:21.494 --> 26:23.563
Maybe this partnership wasn't a good idea.

26:23.597 --> 26:25.564
Just go, I'll be fine.

26:25.598 --> 26:26.431
What is wrong with you?

26:26.465 --> 26:27.632
You are aggravating!

26:27.666 --> 26:28.868
You're an aggravating woman.

26:28.902 --> 26:30.135
You yell at me when I kill people,

26:30.169 --> 26:31.970
you keep taking my arm bolt, and

26:32.004 --> 26:33.773
frankly your planning is sub par.

26:33.807 --> 26:34.907
I wasn't gonna say anything about

26:34.941 --> 26:37.877
that, but it's becoming an issue.

26:37.911 --> 26:39.679
So you don't think you need any help.

26:39.713 --> 26:41.547
How can you help me?

26:46.086 --> 26:46.852
What are those?

26:46.886 --> 26:47.519
Keys.

26:47.553 --> 26:48.688
For what?

26:48.722 --> 26:50.989
They help with things.

26:51.023 --> 26:54.160
This is your trap, isn't it?

26:54.194 --> 26:55.862
I didn't mean what I said.

26:55.896 --> 26:57.863
This is a delightful
partnership with many perks,

26:57.897 --> 27:01.633
it's just that anyone I... everyone I...

27:01.667 --> 27:04.635
the people around me die quite often.

27:04.669 --> 27:09.508
I just thought it would be
nice, for you, if you didn't die.

27:10.644 --> 27:12.745
It'd be nice for me too.

27:21.288 --> 27:24.089
(coughing)

27:26.526 --> 27:28.227
Thank you.

27:28.261 --> 27:31.796
You saved my life, you keep doing that.

27:31.830 --> 27:33.064
Don't take it personally.

27:33.098 --> 27:35.000
[Sol] What if I did, I
might suspect you cared

27:35.034 --> 27:37.869
about me and we'd have
to get to know each other.

27:41.741 --> 27:46.112
Do I look better to you now?

27:47.446 --> 27:50.550
I liked the way you looked before.

27:50.584 --> 27:51.950
That's too bad.

27:51.984 --> 27:55.921
It's okay, I can remember.

28:27.820 --> 28:30.256
Hey, I think my mind
is playing tricks on me.

28:30.290 --> 28:32.458
When I first opened my
eyes, I thought I saw a girl.

28:32.492 --> 28:33.892
[Sol] Yeah, that's Sun Disease.

28:33.926 --> 28:37.529
You were just hallucinating,
don't worry about it.

28:37.563 --> 28:39.096
We keep finding these.

28:39.130 --> 28:40.600
[Cleo] This one was just killed.

28:40.634 --> 28:44.370
(dramatic music)

28:44.404 --> 28:46.339
[Sol] Thought you could sneak up on me, eh?

28:46.373 --> 28:49.374
(gasping)

28:49.408 --> 28:50.275
[Cleo] That's her.

28:50.309 --> 28:52.077
Him, her, you don't know.

28:52.111 --> 28:54.913
He kind of looks like me.

28:54.947 --> 28:57.015
Have you seen my parents?

29:04.924 --> 29:07.926
[Sol] All right, that sounded
like a girl, but look...

29:13.265 --> 29:14.367
[Scout] Team Nine to Control,

29:14.401 --> 29:16.701
I found my partner's body in pieces.

29:16.735 --> 29:17.870
[Control] The Cannibal Giric is hunting

29:17.904 --> 29:20.105
Sol and Cleo, find them before he does,

29:20.139 --> 29:22.842
and don't let him catch you too.

29:22.876 --> 29:25.977
Team Nine, come in Team Nine.

29:26.011 --> 29:27.112
Team Nine?

29:27.146 --> 29:31.349
(speaking foreign language)

29:33.019 --> 29:34.687
[Sol] I mean look, it's a habit.

29:34.721 --> 29:36.656
I didn't know you'd like her.

29:36.690 --> 29:38.457
It just happens.

29:39.725 --> 29:40.892
Killing is a way of life, could

29:40.926 --> 29:42.428
you try not being upset about this?

29:42.462 --> 29:43.996
I'm not upset!

29:44.030 --> 29:46.164
Ugh, this disease is intolerable.

29:46.198 --> 29:48.133
It's disorienting at first,
but you get used to it.

29:48.167 --> 29:49.768
They have a cure for this in the West.

29:49.802 --> 29:50.936
They say there's some real humanity

29:50.970 --> 29:52.470
left out there, good people.

29:52.504 --> 29:53.605
If they got cured, they'd have

29:53.639 --> 29:55.573
to keep track of all those new faces.

29:55.607 --> 29:58.276
There might be something
liberating about starting over.

29:58.310 --> 29:59.978
Sure, we can have insane conversations

30:00.012 --> 30:02.281
where you ignore everything
that just happened!

30:02.315 --> 30:04.115
Thinks of the lives I might have saved.

30:04.149 --> 30:05.551
You should be thanking me, it's

30:05.585 --> 30:07.285
probably the best thing
I've done since we've met.

30:07.319 --> 30:08.521
If I didn't kill her
then, she might have killed

30:08.555 --> 30:12.191
us later, it was her or us, and I chose us!

30:15.928 --> 30:17.362
Cleo!

30:17.396 --> 30:21.233
(screaming)

30:21.267 --> 30:24.403
(choking, coughing)

30:29.475 --> 30:33.145
Woah, that sucked.

30:34.547 --> 30:35.980
Hey there!

30:36.014 --> 30:39.985
Man, had that trap all worked out too.

30:40.019 --> 30:41.853
You know how hard it is to bury yourself?

30:41.887 --> 30:44.122
It's ridiculous!

30:44.156 --> 30:45.358
Sorry about that, I thought you

30:45.392 --> 30:47.192
were more Creatures,
they'll steal anything.

30:47.226 --> 30:48.326
Who are you?

30:48.360 --> 30:49.294
Just another poor working stiff,

30:49.328 --> 30:52.564
a proletariat sent to nab him.

30:52.598 --> 30:54.600
I love that now I find you.

30:54.634 --> 30:58.103
Oh, you're under arrest by the way.

30:58.137 --> 30:59.271
Who chained you?

30:59.305 --> 31:01.006
Just some Creatures, it took like,

31:01.040 --> 31:05.143
seven, nineteen Creatures to restrain me.

31:05.177 --> 31:06.512
They left to get The Witch Warrior

31:06.546 --> 31:07.846
because apparently I'm not good

31:07.880 --> 31:09.614
at answering questions, so the

31:09.648 --> 31:13.319
Warrior is supposed to "influence" me.

31:13.353 --> 31:15.087
I can't wait.

31:16.388 --> 31:19.725
Sol, Sol, I always really liked you, man!

31:19.759 --> 31:21.560
I mean I like that you
tried in Paradise, man.

31:21.594 --> 31:23.763
Reform and old school, I get it!

31:23.797 --> 31:26.164
You're just misunderstood!

31:26.198 --> 31:28.868
So you wanna break this chain for me?

31:28.902 --> 31:31.237
Sure, if you promise to tell

31:31.271 --> 31:33.471
all the other scout teams I'm dead.

31:33.505 --> 31:35.940
Promise...

31:35.974 --> 31:37.942
Yeah, yeah, that wouldn't be a problem.

31:37.976 --> 31:41.846
What if, also, you traded
me your access card.

31:41.880 --> 31:43.716
Or we can forget the card!

31:43.750 --> 31:46.051
We can forget the card!

31:46.085 --> 31:47.152
I'll tell everyone you're dead

31:47.186 --> 31:49.187
if you kill The Oracle!

31:50.290 --> 31:53.124
And then snap my chain.

31:53.158 --> 31:54.092
[Cleo] Why would they believe you?

31:54.126 --> 31:55.827
Because I'm really popular.

31:55.861 --> 31:57.329
I used to be a Scout, in fact, I

31:57.363 --> 31:58.697
got 50 of my closest City Scout

31:58.731 --> 32:00.466
bros coming to rescue me right now!

32:00.500 --> 32:01.867
Part of that is because word is

32:01.901 --> 32:04.804
I'm sitting on Sol's path
and they want him bad.

32:04.838 --> 32:06.772
But I'm plenty popular.

32:06.806 --> 32:08.039
[Sol] He's a liar. come on!

32:08.073 --> 32:08.974
[Cleo] I know, but we don't know

32:09.008 --> 32:10.208
how many scouts are after you.

32:10.242 --> 32:11.709
[Sol] We're going straight to The King.

32:11.743 --> 32:13.446
All right, The Oracle's
harder to find than Paradise.

32:13.480 --> 32:14.580
[Cleo] Not for me.

32:14.614 --> 32:15.714
Hey, why do you want The Oracle dead?

32:15.748 --> 32:18.551
Oh, I don't, Paradise does.

32:18.585 --> 32:19.651
She's plotting with The Nomad King

32:19.685 --> 32:20.785
to take the city down.

32:20.819 --> 32:21.687
What kind of proof do you need?

32:21.721 --> 32:22.755
Her head.

32:22.789 --> 32:25.323
Decapitation. Ssszzt!

32:25.357 --> 32:28.126
What if you die before
we get the head back here?

32:29.863 --> 32:32.230
Yeah, hey, you'd better hurry

32:32.264 --> 32:33.431
if you wanna beat all these people

32:33.465 --> 32:35.100
back here because, you know, if

32:35.134 --> 32:39.604
they're here and you're
here, it gets political.

32:39.638 --> 32:41.206
And who needs that, right?

32:41.240 --> 32:43.409
Sol, you know.

32:43.443 --> 32:45.076
I don't trust him, I'm not doing it!

32:45.110 --> 32:46.644
Look at him, who's gonna listen to him?

32:46.678 --> 32:47.813
He looks like a weasel!

32:47.847 --> 32:50.983
Yeah, but hypothetically, if my

32:51.017 --> 32:52.918
friends didn't belive
me that you were dead,

32:52.952 --> 32:54.285
and that's a big if, bro, I am

32:54.319 --> 32:56.956
like the point man with these fellas.

32:56.990 --> 33:00.226
But if they don't, it won't matter

33:00.260 --> 33:02.127
because if we have proof that The Oracle

33:02.161 --> 33:03.562
is dead, taking that proof home

33:03.596 --> 33:08.433
is way bigger than you and
your stolen access card.

33:08.467 --> 33:10.502
You're scot-free, man.

33:12.504 --> 33:17.943
(tribal music)

33:21.213 --> 33:22.915
Ahem.

33:23.950 --> 33:25.785
I don't wanna talk about it.

33:28.253 --> 33:30.322
Okay...

33:30.356 --> 33:31.756
What?

33:31.790 --> 33:33.392
Would it bother you if
I don't do this with you?

33:35.494 --> 33:36.695
Don't look at me like that.

33:36.729 --> 33:38.130
I have no desire to tangle with

33:38.164 --> 33:39.765
some spirit spitting religious...

33:39.799 --> 33:41.667
She's really more like a Therapist.

33:41.701 --> 33:43.168
Are you trying to make me kill now?

33:43.202 --> 33:45.237
No, I'm not, it's just I can't do it.

33:45.271 --> 33:48.707
We know each other, it would be weird.

33:48.741 --> 33:51.709
So I offer her an invocation
asking her to join us.

33:51.743 --> 33:55.014
If she accepts, the rock will burn.

33:55.048 --> 33:56.215
And then she'll appear.

33:56.249 --> 33:57.315
She comes to us?

33:57.349 --> 33:58.484
Shouldn't she know we're coming

33:58.518 --> 34:00.119
and already be here, like an Oracle?

34:00.153 --> 34:02.888
Trust me, she's a professional.

34:02.922 --> 34:06.391
Oraculum sacrum veni et nos comt...

34:06.425 --> 34:07.560
Clearly.

34:07.594 --> 34:09.360
I'm not getting it high enough.

34:15.199 --> 34:17.436
Oraculum sacrum veni et nos comtua sep...

34:17.469 --> 34:20.672
arrgh, I used to be able to do this!

34:28.781 --> 34:33.219
Oraculum sacrum veni et
nos comtua sepientia ducae!

34:47.367 --> 34:49.900
With any luck, she's not on vacation.

34:49.935 --> 34:51.570
She travels.

34:51.603 --> 34:54.340
(playful music)

34:54.373 --> 34:55.541
[Oracle] What kind of a situation

34:55.574 --> 34:58.543
is it to have half a boat, I mean really,

34:58.577 --> 35:00.311
everyone else has a whole boat.

35:00.345 --> 35:02.014
It really really depresses me to think

35:02.048 --> 35:04.983
every time that I... oh,
okay, you've killed it.

35:05.017 --> 35:06.517
Very good, Arthur, but you've killed it,

35:06.551 --> 35:08.119
you don't have to kill it anymore.

35:08.153 --> 35:10.555
Arthur, put the oar down, hunny.

35:10.589 --> 35:13.191
[Cleo] I might need to talk
with her for a minute first.

35:16.995 --> 35:18.697
And hurry up, darling.

35:18.731 --> 35:19.932
Sweetheart!

35:19.966 --> 35:22.001
Hi!

35:22.035 --> 35:23.568
[Oracle] Don't worry,
it was working vacation.

35:23.602 --> 35:24.570
I needed a fish for this, otherwise

35:24.604 --> 35:26.338
I would have arrived sooner.

35:26.372 --> 35:28.506
It's been forever, you look beautiful!

35:28.540 --> 35:31.209
Let me guess, you brought
someone to kill me.

35:32.310 --> 35:33.412
We'll talk about it.

35:33.446 --> 35:34.947
Arthur, set up my office.

35:34.981 --> 35:36.381
I almost forgot how dull this part

35:36.415 --> 35:38.684
of the world's become, things
are so dead around here.

35:38.718 --> 35:40.418
I wanna hear all about your drama.

35:40.452 --> 35:41.954
Now you need to start collecting

35:41.988 --> 35:44.188
the... (mumble) plant, there's
a famine coming, you'll do well.

35:44.222 --> 35:45.624
Sweetie, your eyes!

35:45.658 --> 35:47.492
I told you you would catch
Sun Disease if you left me.

35:47.526 --> 35:49.662
Yeah, but now you look better than ever.

35:51.196 --> 35:54.532
Hmmm, imagine what he sees.

36:02.207 --> 36:04.108
I know we parted on bad terms.

36:04.142 --> 36:05.610
I hope by now your realize my visions

36:05.644 --> 36:08.914
come true for those who take my advice.

36:08.948 --> 36:11.215
I heard you allied yourself
with The Nomad King.

36:11.249 --> 36:12.751
I told you I would never do that.

36:12.785 --> 36:14.552
His people have done
enough damage around here.

36:14.586 --> 36:16.555
Try prophesying a fortune to a Creature.

36:16.589 --> 36:17.856
It's pointless, what's an Oracle to do with

36:17.890 --> 36:19.525
the rest of her life
under these conditions?

36:19.559 --> 36:21.760
Naturally I could tell you,
but it would depress you.

36:21.794 --> 36:23.162
Well if that's how you feel,

36:23.196 --> 36:25.030
then why do you have a
Creature working for you?

36:27.165 --> 36:28.700
[Oracle] He's a defector, no one you knew.

36:28.734 --> 36:29.867
[Cleo] Does he know that anything

36:29.901 --> 36:31.202
you promise him is a lie and you'll

36:31.236 --> 36:32.671
throw him away once you're bored?

36:32.705 --> 36:34.139
I don't lie.

36:34.173 --> 36:35.606
[Cleo] You promised me a
family and it never happened.

36:35.640 --> 36:36.742
[Oracle] You're confused, and I

36:36.776 --> 36:38.309
never throw anyone away, I simply

36:38.343 --> 36:40.179
help people find their
most appropriate path.

36:40.213 --> 36:41.512
The smart ones listen.

36:41.546 --> 36:43.048
A little faith on your
part wouldn't kill you.

36:43.082 --> 36:44.950
It might even make your
personality more attractive,

36:44.984 --> 36:46.251
but what do I know?

36:46.285 --> 36:47.753
It's sad really, and don't get me

36:47.787 --> 36:50.255
started on your silly pipe
dream about the Isle De Roca.

36:50.289 --> 36:51.622
Money can't buy you what you want.

36:51.656 --> 36:53.057
It will never bring them back, you know.

36:53.091 --> 36:54.258
Your family is gone.

36:54.292 --> 36:55.727
Don't blame me for seeing what

36:55.761 --> 36:59.097
I see, sweetheart, it's all
there, right in front of me.

36:59.131 --> 37:01.566
(grunting)

37:01.600 --> 37:02.800
When the reunion is over, I'd

37:02.834 --> 37:04.903
like it if we could move this thing along.

37:10.075 --> 37:13.112
[Oracle] Why did you
sell out to the prisoner?

37:13.146 --> 37:15.546
He's not ready to listen.

37:15.580 --> 37:17.482
Hold this, Ahab.

37:19.051 --> 37:20.852
(grunting)

37:20.886 --> 37:23.455
(laughing)

37:32.497 --> 37:34.432
[Cleo] Sol, what are you doing?

37:34.466 --> 37:35.968
It's just a trick, get up!

37:36.002 --> 37:37.101
Why don't you kill me if you

37:37.135 --> 37:38.470
wanna save him from the City Scouts?

37:38.504 --> 37:40.070
Your sword could take my head off.

37:40.104 --> 37:41.773
Ssszzt, right?!

37:41.807 --> 37:44.410
So please dear, do something or be quiet.

37:48.046 --> 37:50.414
You're adorable, you try so hard.

37:50.448 --> 37:52.483
You need to follow your heart
and stop chasing your past.

37:52.517 --> 37:53.918
Pay attention.

37:53.952 --> 37:54.820
[Cleo] He's doing that,
he's following his heart...

37:54.854 --> 37:56.320
He's following his ego.

37:56.354 --> 37:58.490
What is killing Catherine
really going to accomplish?

37:58.524 --> 37:59.691
Killing her?

37:59.725 --> 38:00.592
[Oracle] Stay on this path, and you'll

38:00.626 --> 38:01.959
repeat your misery forever.

38:01.993 --> 38:04.061
She's not the end, she isn't.

38:04.095 --> 38:07.733
Listen, she's not the end.

38:07.767 --> 38:09.735
See, I'm not so bad.

38:09.769 --> 38:10.769
Normally I'd charge for this.

38:10.803 --> 38:12.938
[Sol] She's just a con artist.

38:17.109 --> 38:18.209
What did you do to him?

38:18.243 --> 38:20.112
[Oracle] Isn't Cleo beautiful?

38:20.146 --> 38:21.546
I thought you'd might like to see her.

38:21.580 --> 38:23.414
It's interesting how
you look to each other.

38:23.448 --> 38:24.883
I can't cure Sun Disease, Sol,

38:24.917 --> 38:26.985
but I can pause it.

38:27.019 --> 38:28.153
Do you like her?

38:28.187 --> 38:29.954
[Sol] You look like the same person.

38:29.988 --> 38:30.988
You're the same woman.

38:31.022 --> 38:32.224
[Oracle] No, I'm just choosing

38:32.258 --> 38:34.059
to appear as Cleo to both of you right now.

38:34.093 --> 38:36.961
I'm The Oracle, I get
to mess around like that.

38:36.995 --> 38:39.664
Besides, you don't look
so good in my outfit.

38:41.466 --> 38:42.867
You have two choices.

38:42.901 --> 38:44.202
One is you can kill me for the

38:44.236 --> 38:45.637
prisoner and save yourself from the Scouts,

38:45.671 --> 38:47.840
but if Cleo stays with
you and you kill Catherine,

38:47.874 --> 38:50.242
she will eventually die.

38:50.276 --> 38:51.776
Wanna hear about the second path?

38:51.810 --> 38:54.313
Leave it all behind, leave
the hunt for Catherine.

38:54.347 --> 38:56.747
Leave killing altogether and walk away.

38:56.781 --> 38:58.416
That goes for you too, sweetheart.

38:58.450 --> 39:00.017
Abandon your fruitless treasure hunt.

39:00.051 --> 39:01.452
Leave your family in the past where

39:01.486 --> 39:04.490
they belong and go West with him.

39:08.026 --> 39:09.227
Certain things cannot be undone,

39:09.261 --> 39:11.563
so be sure you're right before you act.

39:11.597 --> 39:13.865
Killing you will make
half our enemies go away.

39:13.899 --> 39:15.499
But what about this enemy?

39:15.533 --> 39:17.970
My death will only make him stronger.

39:18.004 --> 39:19.772
(snap)

39:25.510 --> 39:26.845
This is a mistake.

39:26.879 --> 39:29.248
You don't believe
anything she said, do you?

39:33.118 --> 39:34.552
[Cleo] Yup.

39:34.586 --> 39:37.456
Cleo, she also said that she couldn't die.

39:37.490 --> 39:39.057
Yeah, she dies all the time.

39:39.091 --> 39:41.426
She thinks it helps her reputation.

39:44.629 --> 39:47.599
Nothing is going to happen
to you, you're with me.

39:47.633 --> 39:50.836
I can kill anything that
comes between us and Catherine.

39:50.870 --> 39:52.037
Well you can't protect me from you,

39:52.071 --> 39:54.072
and you're what's gonna cause this.

39:59.444 --> 40:00.345
Woah woah woah!

40:00.379 --> 40:02.847
No, I'm fine, I'm fine.

40:02.881 --> 40:04.348
Okay, help.

40:06.151 --> 40:09.186
(grunting)

40:09.220 --> 40:11.289
Why are you so hell bent on going

40:11.323 --> 40:13.592
after something that won't
make your lift any better?

40:13.626 --> 40:14.825
You're the most stubborn... (grunting)

40:14.859 --> 40:16.662
Woah, hey!

40:18.397 --> 40:20.132
Here, give me your hand.

40:23.836 --> 40:25.903
How could The Oracle
pick us for each other?

40:25.937 --> 40:29.407
Listen, Senorita, I didn't
ask you to be with me!

40:30.575 --> 40:32.309
Why do you want a family anyway?

40:32.343 --> 40:33.543
I don't.

40:33.577 --> 40:35.813
I gave up on that a long time ago.

40:35.847 --> 40:40.552
And besides, I wouldn't pick you.

40:40.586 --> 40:42.720
Wait, what?

40:42.754 --> 40:45.023
Hey, why not?!

40:45.057 --> 40:47.359
Wait, we've been through here before!

40:49.028 --> 40:50.294
No we haven't.

40:50.328 --> 40:52.497
It's like a labyrinth,
you're just confused.

41:00.606 --> 41:02.441
Shit!

41:02.475 --> 41:04.209
So who would you pick?

41:04.243 --> 41:06.811
Him?

41:06.845 --> 41:08.479
Well he doesn't lie or kill people.

41:08.513 --> 41:09.581
I don't lie.

41:09.615 --> 41:10.816
You told me Catherine was your lover

41:10.850 --> 41:13.084
you were rescuing, you just wanna kill her.

41:13.118 --> 41:14.452
I can see how you might have been misled

41:14.486 --> 41:17.456
by that point, but I
never said that exactly.

41:17.490 --> 41:19.524
Technically, I didn't lie.

41:20.725 --> 41:22.193
Yeah, well technically, if I stay

41:22.227 --> 41:24.796
with you and you kill her, I'll die.

41:24.830 --> 41:27.232
Woah, oh... hey!

41:30.169 --> 41:33.004
(distant screeching)

41:50.656 --> 41:53.624
Even if she's right, and she's not,

41:53.658 --> 41:55.126
she said you'll die eventually.

41:55.160 --> 41:56.427
Everybody dies eventually.

41:56.461 --> 41:57.362
Hey, let me explain something

41:57.396 --> 41:58.630
about Oracle terminology.

41:58.664 --> 42:00.264
"Eventually" means like Tuesday.

42:00.298 --> 42:01.767
Yeah, I don't believe that.

42:01.801 --> 42:03.200
I have to get away from you.

42:03.234 --> 42:04.535
- (arm whirring)
- We had a deal!

42:04.569 --> 42:07.372
You are not done until I find Catherine.

42:12.577 --> 42:15.713
Now let's go and get
these Scouts off our back.

42:15.747 --> 42:18.450
I don't wanna run into them again.

42:18.484 --> 42:20.485
[Cleo] Yeah, neither do I.

42:34.100 --> 42:37.135
Oh, you guys, I love you guys!

42:40.171 --> 42:41.872
Where are your friends?

42:41.906 --> 42:44.342
Funny thing about that is my bros came by

42:44.376 --> 42:49.347
and left me here, (laughs) they're a riot.

42:49.381 --> 42:50.581
They really want Sol.

42:50.615 --> 42:51.883
But this, this, when they see this,

42:51.917 --> 42:53.952
when they come back,
they will, they love me,

42:53.986 --> 42:59.523
this puts you out of their
minds and I will be a rich man.

42:59.557 --> 43:01.325
That's disgusting.

43:01.359 --> 43:03.128
You wanna lose that arm too?

43:03.162 --> 43:06.598
Hey now, lover's quarrel?

43:07.732 --> 43:08.900
Would you mind holding off on that

43:08.934 --> 43:11.735
for just a minute and snap this chain?

43:11.769 --> 43:12.938
I can catch up to my friends right

43:12.972 --> 43:14.106
now and tell them that you're dead.

43:14.140 --> 43:18.110
For you guys, anything, or you know what?

43:18.144 --> 43:19.543
I promise.

43:19.577 --> 43:21.179
Come in, guys, come in, big news!

43:21.213 --> 43:22.012
[Scout] What do you want, asshole?

43:22.046 --> 43:23.548
We're not rescuing you.

43:23.582 --> 43:24.983
He's like my brother.

43:25.017 --> 43:28.253
Hey buddy, Sol and that
chick we robbed are dead.

43:28.287 --> 43:30.155
They came by, The Oracle was chasing them,

43:30.189 --> 43:32.657
she killed them, but man, I was... (mumble)

43:32.691 --> 43:35.459
and I got her, I killed The
Oracle, it was ridiculous!

43:35.493 --> 43:38.262
Mission accomplished,
bro, we're going home!

43:38.296 --> 43:39.831
[Scout] I'll send you one Scout Team,

43:39.865 --> 43:43.135
but if you're lying again,
we'll leave you there for good.

43:43.169 --> 43:44.369
What a joker.

43:44.403 --> 43:46.470
So how about snapping my chain?

43:46.504 --> 43:48.206
The Witch Warrior's coming soon.

43:48.240 --> 43:50.441
That doesn't sound good.

43:50.475 --> 43:52.177
It's better if I just
go and meet my friends.

43:52.211 --> 43:54.178
Who sent your people to rob me?

43:57.149 --> 43:59.951
What, hey, hey!

44:00.986 --> 44:02.119
You guys are jerks!

44:02.153 --> 44:03.555
This is a jerk move, man!

44:03.589 --> 44:06.023
I tried to play the
diplomat like a good guy!

44:06.057 --> 44:07.726
I don't ask for anything in return!

44:07.760 --> 44:09.961
One head, no big deal!

44:09.995 --> 44:11.530
And what do you do for me?!

44:11.564 --> 44:14.465
You play the screw you card, nice!

44:14.499 --> 44:15.867
This is nice!

44:15.901 --> 44:18.135
You know how long I'm gonna
be stuck out here for?!

44:18.169 --> 44:22.039
Yeah, I don't either, that sucks!

44:31.950 --> 44:33.651
If The Oracle made them rob you,

44:33.685 --> 44:35.954
then she can't be trusted!

44:35.988 --> 44:37.722
You're not going to
die, we're not, we're not

44:37.756 --> 44:39.724
on one of her paths, we're
not stuck in her grip!

44:39.758 --> 44:41.559
Yes we are!

44:41.593 --> 44:43.461
Stay away from me.

44:44.562 --> 44:46.263
You can't leave me!

44:50.435 --> 44:51.937
Cleo?

44:56.609 --> 44:58.076
Cleo!

44:59.211 --> 45:04.649
(dramatic music)

45:39.517 --> 45:44.222
[Voices] Sol, Sol, Soool...

45:45.557 --> 45:47.992
This could be a problem.

45:48.026 --> 45:50.162
(grunting)

45:58.803 --> 46:02.106
(siren)

46:02.140 --> 46:06.644
(clicking, screeching)

46:09.381 --> 46:12.383
It's not her, get the safe box anyway.

46:12.417 --> 46:15.320
Easy, son, it isn't
wise to travel at night.

46:15.354 --> 46:17.322
Too many Invisibles.

46:17.356 --> 46:19.057
Stay down now!

46:24.196 --> 46:25.863
(creaking)

46:25.897 --> 46:27.666
You son of a bitch!

46:27.700 --> 46:29.601
(grunting)

46:29.635 --> 46:32.836
That was the safe box,
nobody was gonna find ya!

46:32.870 --> 46:35.240
I save your life and you break my stuff.

46:35.274 --> 46:36.974
Now I gotta build a new one!

46:37.008 --> 46:38.142
You stop right there (siren)

46:38.176 --> 46:40.312
or get a little dose of my ear killer.

46:42.647 --> 46:44.548
Sit down and eat.

46:52.490 --> 46:54.392
What were you doing out at night?

46:54.426 --> 46:55.860
I'm on my way to see The King.

46:55.894 --> 47:00.865
Good luck, I hear nobody
sees him face to face.

47:00.899 --> 47:02.901
I'm looking for my daughter.

47:02.935 --> 47:05.003
My wife is out scouring right now.

47:05.037 --> 47:06.738
[Sol] You let your wife wander alone?

47:06.772 --> 47:09.139
I can't stop her.

47:09.173 --> 47:11.909
See, we used to all travel
together as a family.

47:11.943 --> 47:14.412
Who keeps a family these days?

47:14.446 --> 47:16.481
My daughter started going off alone.

47:16.515 --> 47:17.715
Instead of making her stay with

47:17.749 --> 47:20.218
us, I gave her weapons to protect herself.

47:20.252 --> 47:22.720
One day she just didn't come back.

47:22.754 --> 47:24.421
What kind of weapons did you give her?

47:24.455 --> 47:26.223
Just these.

47:27.292 --> 47:28.193
You can find them all over the

47:28.227 --> 47:30.528
place, lots of people have them.

47:32.231 --> 47:34.733
Years ago, I met an Oracle, and she

47:34.767 --> 47:36.501
told me I would have a daughter

47:36.535 --> 47:39.369
and that my little girl
would change the world.

47:39.403 --> 47:41.972
If she dies, I messed up a prophecy.

47:42.006 --> 47:43.874
How would the world change because of her?

47:43.908 --> 47:46.110
The Empire would fall,
I think, I don't know.

47:46.144 --> 47:47.112
It would stop this endless cycle

47:47.146 --> 47:48.680
of violence we're all living in.

47:48.714 --> 47:49.914
How am I supposed to live with

47:49.948 --> 47:51.816
myself if I made it so that can't happen?

47:51.850 --> 47:54.586
It's not your fault.

47:54.620 --> 47:56.086
I met your daughter.

47:56.120 --> 47:57.521
I thought she was someone dangerous,

47:57.555 --> 48:01.325
those arrows really have
been used all over the place.

48:01.359 --> 48:02.827
When did you see her?!

48:02.861 --> 48:04.929
Where is she?!

48:04.963 --> 48:06.564
She's dead.

48:08.734 --> 48:10.502
I killed her.

48:17.443 --> 48:22.948
(suspenseful music)

48:41.098 --> 48:45.102
[Cleo] Oraculum sacrum veni
et nos comtua sepientia ducae!

48:46.205 --> 48:48.273
Come on, where are you?

48:50.975 --> 48:53.877
Oraculum sacrum veni et nos comtua sep...

48:55.314 --> 48:57.515
Sepientia ducae.

48:58.917 --> 49:01.852
(screaming)

49:01.886 --> 49:07.124
(action music)

49:08.926 --> 49:11.229
[Cleo] Go eat somebody else!

49:27.245 --> 49:30.714
(grunting, growling)

49:59.877 --> 50:05.383
(speaking foreign language)

50:20.631 --> 50:26.136
(eerie music)

50:30.709 --> 50:32.843
Hi.

50:32.877 --> 50:34.479
Hi.

50:34.513 --> 50:36.081
All gone!

50:39.551 --> 50:41.184
(groaning)

50:41.218 --> 50:43.153
(giggling)

50:50.495 --> 50:52.997
I sure had you and your
boyfriend fooled, didn't I?

50:53.031 --> 50:54.865
I thought he was gonna pop my head off!

50:54.899 --> 50:57.302
He hurt me so bad, big bully.

50:57.336 --> 50:59.471
Do you kill people with those?

51:00.606 --> 51:03.106
I just dance with them.

51:03.140 --> 51:06.077
(giggling)

51:08.113 --> 51:10.247
Shoom, shoom!

51:10.281 --> 51:15.787
(distorted singing)

51:19.758 --> 51:22.660
(grunting)

51:27.832 --> 51:30.568
(giggling)

51:35.006 --> 51:36.573
Look!

51:36.607 --> 51:38.409
Aren't I clever?

51:38.443 --> 51:39.644
What can you trade me for it, a bullet,

51:39.678 --> 51:40.845
you said you were out of bullets, I never

51:40.879 --> 51:42.113
said that, it was a direct implication,

51:42.147 --> 51:43.514
I thought you read my
face, you're an arrogant

51:43.548 --> 51:44.749
bastard, don't you criticize
me, don't yell at me,

51:44.783 --> 51:46.684
I'm not yelling at you, yes you are!

51:48.553 --> 51:50.188
(giggling)

51:50.222 --> 51:54.191
(mocked gunshot) That was
your last shot, wasn't it?

51:54.225 --> 51:56.493
Would I still be standing here if it was?

52:02.401 --> 52:03.967
You're a goner, you know.

52:04.001 --> 52:05.202
You should pay attention to me,

52:05.236 --> 52:06.371
you should listen to me when I talk to you

52:06.405 --> 52:08.372
because if you choose this first path,

52:08.406 --> 52:11.943
Cleo will eventually die.

52:11.977 --> 52:14.078
Sol's a goners too.

52:15.847 --> 52:17.648
I saw him with my daddy!

52:17.682 --> 52:18.916
He told my daddy he killed me,

52:18.950 --> 52:23.354
and oh boy, you wouldn't
believe what Daddy did!

52:24.423 --> 52:27.090
Is your daddy nearby?

52:27.124 --> 52:28.425
You should stay away from him.

52:28.459 --> 52:29.394
Tell me where he is.

52:29.428 --> 52:31.496
Mmmmm, no.

52:31.530 --> 52:32.863
Tell me!

52:35.066 --> 52:38.302
(dramatic sting)

52:38.336 --> 52:41.805
(playful music)

52:41.839 --> 52:47.211
(action music)

52:48.580 --> 52:54.085
(grunting, incoherent noises)

52:58.789 --> 53:00.624
Rawr!

53:00.658 --> 53:06.097
(dramatic music)

53:46.104 --> 53:47.972
Hello there!

53:48.006 --> 53:49.907
I'm looking for my friend.

53:49.941 --> 53:51.108
[Henry] Does he have a robotic arm

53:51.142 --> 53:54.512
and an overdeveloped streak of arrogance?

53:54.546 --> 53:55.847
He's your friend?

53:55.881 --> 53:57.148
Yes...

53:57.182 --> 53:59.550
Argh, ow, why can't people just

53:59.584 --> 54:01.718
shake hands when they meet anymore?!

54:01.752 --> 54:03.720
And you're next after him.

54:03.754 --> 54:06.523
Hey, you know your daughter's
just over that ridge.

54:08.660 --> 54:10.128
You don't know my daughter.

54:10.162 --> 54:11.995
[Cleo] She showed her dancing to me.

54:13.164 --> 54:15.300
Do you know about her dancing?

54:16.635 --> 54:18.202
That way.

54:20.638 --> 54:23.106
Your friend's right down here.

54:24.309 --> 54:29.046
(grunting, robotic whirring)

54:29.080 --> 54:30.548
Sol?

54:36.254 --> 54:38.255
Sol?

54:38.289 --> 54:40.157
[Sol] Cleo?

54:40.191 --> 54:42.325
(dramatic music)

54:42.359 --> 54:43.461
Where are we?

54:43.495 --> 54:44.829
[Cleo] Oh, um, I got stabbed

54:44.863 --> 54:47.832
in the ass with an arrow,
I'll be two minutes.

54:53.470 --> 54:55.338
[Sol] Hey!

54:55.372 --> 54:57.175
(knocking) Hello!

54:58.475 --> 55:00.142
Why do you wanna go to Paradise?

55:00.176 --> 55:02.613
[Cleo] Some Scout stole
something valuable from me.

55:02.647 --> 55:04.081
It was my mother's.

55:04.115 --> 55:05.849
It's all I have left of my family.

55:05.883 --> 55:08.052
[Sol] Even I wouldn't try
and break into that place.

55:08.086 --> 55:10.054
Is this thing worth dying for?

55:10.088 --> 55:11.521
[Cleo] Is Catherine?

55:11.555 --> 55:14.291
[Sol] That's different,
what I'm doing won't kill me.

55:19.164 --> 55:20.564
Hey, do you think we're being followed?

55:20.598 --> 55:24.434
[Cleo] Yeah, maybe, we're
pretty close to The King.

55:24.468 --> 55:25.903
[Sol] Then why are we stopping to rest?

55:25.937 --> 55:27.537
Won't The King's men attack us?

55:27.571 --> 55:29.273
Or wait until I'm asleep and take you?

55:29.307 --> 55:30.474
[Cleo] Take me?

55:30.508 --> 55:33.477
No, no people stay out of cemeteries.

55:34.646 --> 55:36.647
They're haunted you know.

55:40.185 --> 55:41.885
Let's go back to your cave.

55:41.919 --> 55:44.055
No, it's the only home I have

55:44.089 --> 55:46.791
and you attract too much attention.

55:46.825 --> 55:48.758
Oh don't apologize.

55:48.792 --> 55:52.863
(laughing)

55:52.897 --> 55:54.999
[Sol] My father was a reformer in Paradise.

55:55.033 --> 55:56.834
So many people loved him.

55:56.868 --> 55:58.336
He was a great man.

55:58.370 --> 56:00.570
Catherine turned out to be a Nomad spy.

56:00.604 --> 56:03.840
She and her friends,
they murdered my father.

56:03.874 --> 56:05.742
I killed them all, except Catherine,

56:05.776 --> 56:08.479
before I was caught and sent to prison.

56:08.513 --> 56:10.680
I broke out to find her.

56:10.714 --> 56:12.148
I'm sorry.

56:12.182 --> 56:14.651
[Sol] I feel like I've been
chasing Catherine forever.

56:14.685 --> 56:16.319
I'm tired.

56:20.091 --> 56:21.124
What?

56:21.158 --> 56:22.293
Do you think that we have to

56:22.327 --> 56:23.927
keep being the way that we are forever?

56:23.961 --> 56:27.197
I mean is this still
worth everything to you?

56:27.231 --> 56:29.233
No.

56:29.267 --> 56:30.367
[Cleo] I wanted to believe that

56:30.401 --> 56:32.202
you were chasing Catherine for love.

56:32.236 --> 56:33.169
I wondered what it would be like

56:33.203 --> 56:36.340
to have a man like you chase me.

56:36.374 --> 56:37.474
Some fantasy.

56:37.508 --> 56:38.476
I've never known anyone to fall

56:38.510 --> 56:40.845
in love like that, Senorita.

56:42.080 --> 56:43.747
Sounds foolish.

56:43.781 --> 56:46.717
Yeah, it does.

56:46.751 --> 56:48.251
Thanks.

56:48.285 --> 56:49.419
For the food.

56:49.453 --> 56:51.488
You know, they aren't just good for you.

56:51.522 --> 56:53.323
They're also beautiful.

56:53.357 --> 56:55.693
Women love these, just in case

56:55.727 --> 56:57.093
you ever feel like, I don't know,

56:57.127 --> 57:00.497
indulging in anything foolish.

57:04.301 --> 57:07.204
Maybe I am a fool, and I was just...

57:13.845 --> 57:17.747
I've been thinking about
what The Oracle said.

57:17.781 --> 57:19.483
You don't believe in her.

57:19.517 --> 57:20.651
No, but you do.

57:20.685 --> 57:22.452
Why is she interfering with you and me?

57:22.486 --> 57:23.720
[Cleo] I don't know, she's tricky.

57:23.754 --> 57:25.289
She's the closest to family I have,

57:25.323 --> 57:28.659
but she plays with
people, it's a game to her.

57:28.693 --> 57:30.061
She told me that phone call would

57:30.095 --> 57:34.698
be my way into Paradise,
but I wasn't expecting you.

57:34.732 --> 57:36.267
I don't know what she's up to exactly,

57:36.301 --> 57:39.102
but there's always a catch.

57:39.136 --> 57:40.938
Are you calling me a catch?

57:40.972 --> 57:42.740
Maybe.

57:46.077 --> 57:48.912
I don't wanna see my face on yours anymore.

57:50.647 --> 57:52.849
You said they cure Sun
Disease in the West, right?

57:52.883 --> 57:53.950
Mmmhm.

57:53.984 --> 57:55.086
Well I was wondering if you would

57:55.120 --> 57:57.320
take me there, and you could stay

57:57.354 --> 58:01.992
with me after I kill Catherine.

58:02.026 --> 58:02.793
You can't...

58:02.827 --> 58:04.128
She's the last one.

58:04.162 --> 58:06.430
I promise to stop killing after her.

58:06.464 --> 58:07.430
You'd have to stop now if you

58:07.464 --> 58:09.566
want me to go with you.

58:13.338 --> 58:15.171
And you'd have to give up Paradise.

58:15.205 --> 58:17.673
Yeah, is it worth it?

58:17.707 --> 58:19.443
[Sol] I don't know, maybe.

58:19.477 --> 58:20.610
I'll tell you that man at the well

58:20.644 --> 58:21.845
had me convinced that his daughter

58:21.879 --> 58:24.481
was the most important thing in the world.

58:24.515 --> 58:26.117
And I destroyed it.

58:26.151 --> 58:27.918
I don't wanna do this anymore.

58:27.952 --> 58:32.622
I could give up Catherine
for you, I will, now.

58:32.656 --> 58:33.391
Do you promise?

58:33.425 --> 58:35.059
I do.

58:37.261 --> 58:39.764
So when do we leave?

58:39.798 --> 58:40.930
Tomorrow.

58:40.964 --> 58:42.133
Not right now?

58:42.167 --> 58:45.702
No, no, now would be terrible timing.

58:45.736 --> 58:46.970
You think so?

58:47.004 --> 58:49.372
Yeah, I do.

58:56.247 --> 58:59.150
Wait, I can't.

58:59.184 --> 59:02.553
It's not you, it's me.

59:04.289 --> 59:09.794
(romantic music)

59:43.627 --> 59:48.064
(action music)

59:48.098 --> 59:50.867
(groaning)

59:50.901 --> 59:52.802
(beeping)

59:54.439 --> 59:56.372
Hello?

59:56.406 --> 59:59.043
Hello, hello.

59:59.077 --> 01:00:01.112
Didn't I ask you if
exactly this would happen?

01:00:01.146 --> 01:00:03.113
You did, that's funny.

01:00:03.147 --> 01:00:04.280
I think you have a misunderstanding

01:00:04.314 --> 01:00:06.983
of humor, Senorita.

01:00:07.017 --> 01:00:08.418
It's not working?

01:00:08.452 --> 01:00:09.385
We should have stayed awake.

01:00:09.419 --> 01:00:10.320
Think they knocked us out with

01:00:10.354 --> 01:00:12.021
something when we fell asleep.

01:00:12.055 --> 01:00:14.992
Uh, they're awake, do it again,
he wants them unconscious.

01:00:15.026 --> 01:00:16.360
(beeping)

01:00:16.394 --> 01:00:17.561
Hello?

01:00:17.595 --> 01:00:18.329
Yes.

01:00:18.363 --> 01:00:18.963
What's he saying?

01:00:18.997 --> 01:00:19.863
Yes.

01:00:19.897 --> 01:00:20.764
[Masked Guy] What's wrong?

01:00:20.798 --> 01:00:21.664
It's The Witch Warrior.

01:00:21.698 --> 01:00:22.198
Is it The Witch Warrior?

01:00:22.232 --> 01:00:22.833
Yeah.

01:00:22.867 --> 01:00:24.068
Oh, okay.

01:00:24.102 --> 01:00:25.302
Witch Warriors are The
King's head assassins.

01:00:25.336 --> 01:00:26.537
I think they're actually
only one Warrior left.

01:00:26.571 --> 01:00:27.704
That's good.

01:00:27.738 --> 01:00:28.639
They'll probably take us to meet

01:00:28.673 --> 01:00:30.340
The King and execute us there.

01:00:30.374 --> 01:00:31.508
That's bad.

01:00:31.542 --> 01:00:35.412
Wait, so here, not over at, uh...

01:00:35.446 --> 01:00:36.947
[Masked Guy] What happened,
did he hang up on you?

01:00:36.981 --> 01:00:39.416
Yeah, you know, I mean I've got

01:00:39.450 --> 01:00:40.651
feelings too, I've got kids...

01:00:40.685 --> 01:00:41.985
I know you do, I know you do.

01:00:42.019 --> 01:00:45.222
It's really just, you
know, this is not well.

01:00:45.256 --> 01:00:46.456
[Masked Guy] What is wrong with that guy?

01:00:46.490 --> 01:00:47.758
I don't know, he wants us to wait here.

01:00:47.792 --> 01:00:49.226
I thought he wanted us to go to the ocean.

01:00:49.260 --> 01:00:51.528
No, no beach anymore, he
wants us to wait right here.

01:00:51.562 --> 01:00:52.530
Wait a minute, was it supposed

01:00:52.564 --> 01:00:53.630
to be the beach or the ocean?

01:00:53.664 --> 01:00:55.331
Well both I guess.

01:00:55.365 --> 01:00:57.601
It was the beach, which is at
the ocean, but now it's here.

01:00:57.635 --> 01:00:58.869
Oh, okay, how come?

01:00:58.903 --> 01:01:00.771
(thwip, thwip)

01:01:02.207 --> 01:01:03.407
Are we dying?

01:01:03.441 --> 01:01:04.908
Yes.

01:01:07.111 --> 01:01:09.079
(laughing)

01:01:09.113 --> 01:01:10.813
Well that was lucky.

01:01:10.847 --> 01:01:14.484
(laughing)

01:01:16.486 --> 01:01:20.457
Oh shit, that The Witch Warrior?

01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.961
Yup, that'd be him.

01:01:24.995 --> 01:01:27.430
Oh this can only go well.

01:01:42.847 --> 01:01:48.118
(buzzing)

01:02:03.868 --> 01:02:08.606
(grunting, laughing)

01:02:08.640 --> 01:02:10.506
(sneezing)

01:02:10.540 --> 01:02:13.843
God, that arm is brilliant, mate.

01:02:13.877 --> 01:02:17.081
But you might think about keeping it clean.

01:02:17.115 --> 01:02:20.517
This climate is Machiavellian.

01:02:20.551 --> 01:02:21.985
What we wouldn't give for a flat

01:02:22.019 --> 01:02:25.488
on the ocean with no
parasites and clean air.

01:02:25.522 --> 01:02:27.758
We're paid to kill people in the desert,

01:02:27.792 --> 01:02:31.262
but we're philosophically opposed to dirt.

01:02:31.296 --> 01:02:34.765
Our charge in life is fantastically ironic.

01:02:38.935 --> 01:02:40.302
See this?

01:02:40.336 --> 01:02:42.273
If her heart stops
beating, we, and whoever's

01:02:42.307 --> 01:02:45.876
nearby who just killed us explode.

01:02:45.910 --> 01:02:47.945
That's what they told us anyway.

01:02:47.979 --> 01:02:52.548
It's a deterrent to protect
us from assassination.

01:02:52.582 --> 01:02:55.852
The mad king, in his infinite wisdom,

01:02:55.886 --> 01:03:00.256
wired it to all his finest assassins.

01:03:00.290 --> 01:03:03.093
Guy's a wanker, make a note of that.

01:03:03.127 --> 01:03:04.628
I will, thank you.

01:03:04.662 --> 01:03:06.497
[Warrior] Right, upon finding you,

01:03:06.531 --> 01:03:08.766
we are meant to transport you to

01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:10.300
The King directly whereupon it's

01:03:10.334 --> 01:03:13.003
on to your execution before his eyes.

01:03:13.037 --> 01:03:16.439
But that's no matter now,
this changes everything.

01:03:16.473 --> 01:03:18.441
We killed some Scouts
who were carrying this.

01:03:18.475 --> 01:03:19.709
Thankfully, we know The Oracle

01:03:19.743 --> 01:03:21.244
isn't really dead, but we're sure

01:03:21.278 --> 01:03:24.048
she's quite upset nevertheless.

01:03:24.082 --> 01:03:24.981
Have you spoken to her?

01:03:25.015 --> 01:03:26.916
Sadly, no, we can't find her.

01:03:26.950 --> 01:03:28.351
And that, my dear, is why we're

01:03:28.385 --> 01:03:31.055
disobeying orders, jumping the gun,

01:03:31.089 --> 01:03:33.389
reaching Command and being an otherwise

01:03:33.423 --> 01:03:35.592
right git by using you for our

01:03:35.626 --> 01:03:39.496
own splendidly selfish gains.

01:03:39.530 --> 01:03:42.131
Now this is a portal.

01:03:42.165 --> 01:03:44.334
Should lead straight to The King, zap.

01:03:44.368 --> 01:03:45.302
This is where we would drop you

01:03:45.336 --> 01:03:47.237
off later were we not disobeying

01:03:47.271 --> 01:03:49.472
orders, jumping the gun, breaching

01:03:49.506 --> 01:03:50.941
Command and being an otherwise...

01:03:50.975 --> 01:03:52.443
We got it.

01:03:55.879 --> 01:03:58.349
[Sol] How does it work?

01:03:58.383 --> 01:04:02.486
Get my manual, there we go.

01:04:03.720 --> 01:04:07.057
Apply hand to surface.

01:04:07.091 --> 01:04:10.093
All right, suppose we'll give that a go.

01:04:10.127 --> 01:04:15.032
You realize this won't end well for you.

01:04:15.066 --> 01:04:17.534
Unless you make a deal with us

01:04:17.568 --> 01:04:19.635
that would transpire thusly, you

01:04:19.669 --> 01:04:22.673
take us to The Oracle,
and we'll release you.

01:04:22.707 --> 01:04:23.874
Why do you wanna see The Oracle?

01:04:23.908 --> 01:04:27.110
That, my dear, is between her and us.

01:04:27.144 --> 01:04:30.447
[Sol] You let Cleo go now,
and I'll help you find her.

01:04:30.481 --> 01:04:32.616
I've seen her summon before.

01:04:39.289 --> 01:04:40.891
No bright ideas.

01:04:40.925 --> 01:04:44.428
(snap, snap)

01:04:46.763 --> 01:04:49.098
(buzzing)

01:04:51.435 --> 01:04:54.405
I hope that's the most
work we'll do all day.

01:04:55.673 --> 01:04:57.508
You can come back for her after.

01:04:57.542 --> 01:04:59.877
Fine, let's go.

01:05:02.814 --> 01:05:04.313
[Warrior] You and that arm seem useful.

01:05:04.347 --> 01:05:05.682
When The Oracle's out of the way

01:05:05.716 --> 01:05:07.117
and we're in charge, perhaps you

01:05:07.151 --> 01:05:08.684
could be our personal minion.

01:05:08.718 --> 01:05:11.287
- (whirring)
- I appreciate that!

01:05:11.321 --> 01:05:14.391
(action music)

01:05:14.425 --> 01:05:16.325
Are you out to ruin our day?

01:05:16.359 --> 01:05:18.796
(grunting)

01:05:24.734 --> 01:05:26.870
(buzzing)

01:05:30.073 --> 01:05:32.175
(arm whirring)

01:05:35.879 --> 01:05:36.979
[Cleo] Sol, what are you doing?!

01:05:37.013 --> 01:05:39.081
Keeping my promise, he's not dead.

01:05:39.115 --> 01:05:40.550
You didn't promise to get beaten to death.

01:05:40.584 --> 01:05:44.054
[Sol] Well I don't see
you helping the situation!

01:05:44.088 --> 01:05:45.888
[Cleo] Can't you knock him out?

01:05:47.758 --> 01:05:49.859
No, good thought though.

01:05:53.698 --> 01:05:55.632
(arm whirring)

01:05:59.903 --> 01:06:02.638
(portal humming)

01:06:29.834 --> 01:06:35.172
(suspenseful music)

01:06:41.979 --> 01:06:43.680
King!

01:06:48.252 --> 01:06:49.920
The King!

01:06:51.155 --> 01:06:53.923
The Nomad King, where are you?!

01:07:03.167 --> 01:07:04.701
Hello!

01:07:12.209 --> 01:07:13.810
Woah...

01:07:18.950 --> 01:07:20.282
Welcome back.

01:07:20.316 --> 01:07:21.218
Back?

01:07:21.252 --> 01:07:22.285
I know, you don't remember.

01:07:22.319 --> 01:07:23.686
Have a seat in that chair.

01:07:23.720 --> 01:07:26.490
Don't worry, Cleo will be fine.

01:07:26.524 --> 01:07:28.125
Put those on.

01:07:31.761 --> 01:07:34.197
Please.

01:07:34.231 --> 01:07:37.334
I believe I deserve to be seen properly.

01:07:42.906 --> 01:07:44.240
I thought things got screwed up

01:07:44.274 --> 01:07:46.343
when that woman got
involved, but you made it.

01:07:46.377 --> 01:07:48.744
Thank you for not killing
all the Scouts this time.

01:07:48.778 --> 01:07:49.880
We can reuse them if you like.

01:07:49.914 --> 01:07:50.981
Reuse?

01:07:51.015 --> 01:07:52.215
Oh yes, The Empire's population

01:07:52.249 --> 01:07:53.617
is wearing thinner and thinner,

01:07:53.651 --> 01:07:55.552
but don't worry, sir,
I'll keep you well stacked.

01:07:55.586 --> 01:07:56.954
Why do you keep calling me sir?

01:07:56.988 --> 01:07:59.222
All right, I apologize.

01:07:59.256 --> 01:08:00.523
I should keep this simple.

01:08:00.557 --> 01:08:02.291
I'm not The King.

01:08:04.060 --> 01:08:05.729
You are.

01:08:07.164 --> 01:08:09.666
I'm your personal Physician.

01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:13.070
And loyal servant, here again running

01:08:13.104 --> 01:08:15.271
the show for you as promised.

01:08:15.305 --> 01:08:16.840
Ever since you replaced The King.

01:08:16.874 --> 01:08:20.076
Because since then, this
part of the world got boring!

01:08:20.109 --> 01:08:21.377
We have no war.

01:08:21.412 --> 01:08:22.712
That's a lie.

01:08:22.747 --> 01:08:24.481
I'm not The King, I escaped from prison.

01:08:24.515 --> 01:08:25.982
You did the first time.

01:08:26.015 --> 01:08:30.987
Now I just reset your memory
back to then every time.

01:08:31.020 --> 01:08:32.154
Every time?

01:08:32.189 --> 01:08:34.658
Oh you've played this game...

01:08:35.892 --> 01:08:37.794
I don't even know how many times, a lot.

01:08:37.828 --> 01:08:40.429
It's your entertainment.

01:08:40.462 --> 01:08:41.665
After you've conquered this fairly

01:08:41.698 --> 01:08:43.399
isolated region of the world, you

01:08:43.434 --> 01:08:46.303
had me set up this repeating event

01:08:46.337 --> 01:08:49.339
where you go on a mission to
kill Catherine and The King.

01:08:49.372 --> 01:08:51.907
Now each adventure is different,

01:08:51.941 --> 01:08:53.477
but at the end the latest Witch Warrior

01:08:53.511 --> 01:08:57.580
sends you here, you
duel, you fight, you win.

01:08:57.613 --> 01:09:00.750
I strap this onto your
head and I reset you.

01:09:00.783 --> 01:09:01.652
Back to the beginning.

01:09:01.685 --> 01:09:02.318
That's impossible!

01:09:02.352 --> 01:09:04.120
Not really.

01:09:04.154 --> 01:09:05.488
Catherine didn't murder your father.

01:09:05.522 --> 01:09:07.124
You left Paradise, killed her, killed

01:09:07.158 --> 01:09:09.625
The Nomad King, and took
the throne for yourself.

01:09:09.658 --> 01:09:10.794
Well done, sir.

01:09:10.828 --> 01:09:13.629
However, lately I've noticed that

01:09:13.662 --> 01:09:15.464
you need to kill more and more people

01:09:15.497 --> 01:09:17.901
to reach any level of
satisfaction whatsoever.

01:09:17.935 --> 01:09:19.102
It's gonna be problematic for me

01:09:19.136 --> 01:09:21.470
if we keep going at this rate, you know?

01:09:23.207 --> 01:09:24.774
No.

01:09:24.809 --> 01:09:28.210
I made a promise to never kill again.

01:09:28.243 --> 01:09:30.781
No, this is who you are.

01:09:30.814 --> 01:09:32.249
Ahh, ow!

01:09:32.283 --> 01:09:33.349
[Sol] You're lying to me.

01:09:33.383 --> 01:09:37.553
No, I'm not.

01:09:37.587 --> 01:09:40.288
I am serving you faithfully.

01:09:42.258 --> 01:09:43.359
(buzzing)

01:09:43.394 --> 01:09:44.393
Sir, put this on.

01:09:44.426 --> 01:09:45.828
You'll wake up thinking you've

01:09:45.863 --> 01:09:47.997
stolen the access card and
are fresh out of prison.

01:09:48.031 --> 01:09:49.398
My men from West will arrive shortly

01:09:49.432 --> 01:09:51.032
and cure your Sun Disease.

01:09:51.066 --> 01:09:52.568
The next Catherine, who you didn't

01:09:52.602 --> 01:09:53.769
get to meet this time because you

01:09:53.803 --> 01:09:55.237
are a titch early, is a sitting image

01:09:55.271 --> 01:09:56.505
of the original, so if you happen

01:09:56.539 --> 01:09:57.874
to contract Sun Disease again,

01:09:57.908 --> 01:09:59.209
you get it about half the time.

01:09:59.243 --> 01:10:00.410
We'll cure you again just before

01:10:00.444 --> 01:10:02.946
so that you can see
her and savor your kill.

01:10:02.980 --> 01:10:04.981
What about my arm?

01:10:05.015 --> 01:10:06.282
That can't happen every time.

01:10:06.316 --> 01:10:08.751
About that...

01:10:08.785 --> 01:10:10.821
We can't reset that because last

01:10:10.855 --> 01:10:12.923
time what happened is
you got too carried away,

01:10:12.957 --> 01:10:15.791
and you killed the previous Witch Warrior.

01:10:15.825 --> 01:10:17.460
When he blew up, you burnt your arm.

01:10:17.494 --> 01:10:19.228
Now they don't carry real bombs anymore.

01:10:19.262 --> 01:10:24.101
We've replaced them with something else.

01:10:24.135 --> 01:10:25.568
It's a secret, they don't know.

01:10:25.602 --> 01:10:28.405
So I worked your arm into the scenario.

01:10:28.439 --> 01:10:30.706
Eh, do you like this?

01:10:30.740 --> 01:10:32.875
Wow, do you like this
one, do you want a new one?

01:10:32.909 --> 01:10:34.210
What happens if I die?

01:10:34.244 --> 01:10:35.778
(laughing)

01:10:35.812 --> 01:10:37.647
You?

01:10:37.681 --> 01:10:38.948
We've had a couple of close calls,

01:10:38.982 --> 01:10:40.483
but that particular outcome,

01:10:40.517 --> 01:10:42.318
I think, is highly unlikely.

01:10:42.352 --> 01:10:43.754
All right, you know what?

01:10:43.788 --> 01:10:48.325
I like the idea of you having a sexy

01:10:48.359 --> 01:10:52.295
female guide, I can add that.

01:10:52.329 --> 01:10:55.064
You can fall in love,
become a little more human.

01:10:55.098 --> 01:10:56.465
What do you think?

01:10:56.499 --> 01:10:58.668
Wait, The Oracle, she's real.

01:10:58.702 --> 01:11:00.803
Yes, but I wanna keep
her out of the picture.

01:11:00.837 --> 01:11:03.874
That woman, she wasn't
supposed to get involved.

01:11:03.908 --> 01:11:06.909
So just whatever she said
to you, just forget it.

01:11:06.943 --> 01:11:09.646
Well you're about to forget it anyway.

01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.380
Not forget, we repress your memories,

01:11:11.414 --> 01:11:14.885
we do not erase them, you
are still you under it all.

01:11:17.221 --> 01:11:19.089
Sir, what are you doing?

01:11:20.891 --> 01:11:22.625
Ow, ugh!

01:11:22.659 --> 01:11:25.161
Ahh!

01:11:25.195 --> 01:11:26.396
[Sol] This is a trick!

01:11:26.430 --> 01:11:27.997
What happens if I don't put this on?

01:11:28.031 --> 01:11:30.633
[Oracle] Then you'll have
a chance to save Cleo.

01:11:31.968 --> 01:11:33.937
The Witch Warrior will kill her.

01:11:33.971 --> 01:11:35.004
What are you doing here?

01:11:35.038 --> 01:11:37.006
Fulfilling my promise to Cleo.

01:11:37.040 --> 01:11:38.174
I told her I'd take care of her.

01:11:38.208 --> 01:11:39.375
Is that why you had her robbed?

01:11:39.409 --> 01:11:41.178
[Oracle] Yes, I promised her a family.

01:11:41.212 --> 01:11:42.745
How else was I supposed
to get her out of here?

01:11:42.779 --> 01:11:44.080
I called her to take you to the West,

01:11:44.114 --> 01:11:45.648
but she missed the call thanks to you,

01:11:45.682 --> 01:11:47.951
and I had to leave my vacation
to come fix everything.

01:11:47.985 --> 01:11:50.120
Nothing but lunatics in the West, sir.

01:11:50.154 --> 01:11:52.722
You're not supposed to be here, lady!

01:11:52.756 --> 01:11:54.723
And you shouldn't tamper with my design.

01:11:54.757 --> 01:11:56.625
This cycle's fragile and precise.

01:11:56.659 --> 01:11:59.094
He made me promise to keep
this going, and I have.

01:11:59.128 --> 01:12:01.564
Sol, do you want to be a monster forever?

01:12:01.598 --> 01:12:03.299
This idiot here, this complete fool,

01:12:03.333 --> 01:12:05.168
would have you believe that you are a King.

01:12:05.202 --> 01:12:06.503
But I say you are the sad ruler

01:12:06.537 --> 01:12:08.537
of a land that owns you.

01:12:08.571 --> 01:12:09.805
(laughing)

01:12:09.839 --> 01:12:10.807
It's ludicrous!

01:12:10.841 --> 01:12:12.209
Sir, put my device on.

01:12:12.243 --> 01:12:14.443
This land has nothing
left but your excellency.

01:12:14.477 --> 01:12:17.513
I got mini societies
built around your patterns.

01:12:17.547 --> 01:12:20.116
You are The Empire.

01:12:20.150 --> 01:12:23.053
Forget about Cleo, I'll
get you a better girl.

01:12:23.087 --> 01:12:25.088
You can have 10 girls, 20!

01:12:25.122 --> 01:12:26.790
Is Cleo going to die if she stays with me?

01:12:26.824 --> 01:12:27.958
[Oracle] Yes, if you stay here

01:12:27.992 --> 01:12:29.726
in this endless cycle of violence.

01:12:29.760 --> 01:12:30.960
The West is your only hope.

01:12:30.994 --> 01:12:33.763
I have a man from the West coming, sir.

01:12:33.797 --> 01:12:35.831
He'll supply you with new goggles.

01:12:35.865 --> 01:12:37.934
Put the device on.

01:12:46.377 --> 01:12:48.010
I can do this forever.

01:12:48.044 --> 01:12:50.379
Ahh, again?

01:12:54.818 --> 01:12:57.519
Don't you see how this works?

01:12:57.553 --> 01:12:59.488
You need me!

01:12:59.522 --> 01:13:00.857
I make this world turn.

01:13:00.891 --> 01:13:03.360
(laughs) The world is big!

01:13:03.394 --> 01:13:05.094
And you are tiny.

01:13:05.128 --> 01:13:06.295
If you don't stop what you're doing,

01:13:06.329 --> 01:13:07.930
you're not gonna like where you end up.

01:13:07.964 --> 01:13:09.732
And break my promise?

01:13:09.766 --> 01:13:11.067
He needs me!

01:13:11.101 --> 01:13:13.436
Why?

01:13:13.470 --> 01:13:15.739
You look like everybody else.

01:13:20.010 --> 01:13:21.744
Sir...

01:13:22.846 --> 01:13:25.314
This is your dream.

01:13:25.348 --> 01:13:27.250
This is Paradise.

01:13:27.284 --> 01:13:29.486
I don't want a revolving kingdom!

01:13:29.520 --> 01:13:31.220
This ends now.

01:13:31.254 --> 01:13:35.791
We could change the cycle, modify it.

01:13:35.825 --> 01:13:37.494
You could live out other fantasies.

01:13:37.528 --> 01:13:39.463
Get out of my face.

01:13:41.699 --> 01:13:43.833
No, no, not the water!

01:13:43.867 --> 01:13:45.101
What have you done?!

01:13:45.135 --> 01:13:47.336
My devices will be ruined!

01:13:47.370 --> 01:13:48.804
Cleo says you travel a lot.

01:13:48.838 --> 01:13:50.639
Is that right?

01:13:50.673 --> 01:13:52.474
You wanna go somewhere?

01:13:52.508 --> 01:13:54.410
Yeah.

01:14:06.022 --> 01:14:11.528
Oraculum sacrum veniet nos
comtua sepientia duchee!

01:14:13.129 --> 01:14:14.464
Sepientia ducae.

01:14:14.498 --> 01:14:15.665
(growling)

01:14:15.699 --> 01:14:17.767
Sepenchia duchee.

01:14:17.801 --> 01:14:19.736
Sepientia ducae.

01:14:19.770 --> 01:14:20.670
That's what we said!

01:14:20.704 --> 01:14:21.972
No, it isn't.

01:14:22.006 --> 01:14:24.374
You said this would work.

01:14:24.408 --> 01:14:27.110
Shame, looks like we'll
have to kill you after all.

01:14:27.144 --> 01:14:28.711
That'll probably make
her visit us right quick.

01:14:28.745 --> 01:14:30.379
Try it again!

01:14:30.413 --> 01:14:35.050
Oraculum sacrum veniet
nos comtua sepientia ducae.

01:14:35.084 --> 01:14:36.852
(sneezes)

01:14:39.757 --> 01:14:41.057
Hell with it.

01:14:41.091 --> 01:14:43.860
You can do it, you're doing good.

01:14:43.894 --> 01:14:48.732
Oraculum sacrum veniet
nos comtua sepientia ducae.

01:14:48.766 --> 01:14:51.368
Bitch come here!

01:14:54.104 --> 01:14:56.071
Sorry luv, that plan's bollocks.

01:14:56.105 --> 01:14:57.840
We'll make this quick.

01:15:00.677 --> 01:15:02.445
(yelps)

01:15:02.479 --> 01:15:04.047
Sorry.

01:15:05.748 --> 01:15:07.282
Ow!

01:15:07.316 --> 01:15:09.352
Not exactly going quick, is it?

01:15:09.386 --> 01:15:11.053
Hold on.

01:15:17.226 --> 01:15:20.497
(sneezes) Useless piece of equipment.

01:15:26.837 --> 01:15:28.838
You don't have to take it personally.

01:15:28.872 --> 01:15:32.342
Maybe you could just
quickly dehydrate for us.

01:15:32.376 --> 01:15:34.477
What are you running
around with Sol for anyway?

01:15:34.511 --> 01:15:36.045
It's pointless to fall in love these days.

01:15:36.079 --> 01:15:37.546
And if Sol is still alive, he's

01:15:37.580 --> 01:15:39.115
probably selling you out somewhere.

01:15:39.149 --> 01:15:40.984
No he isn't.

01:15:42.386 --> 01:15:45.455
Darling, what's the point?

01:15:45.489 --> 01:15:49.159
Hope is the major prerequisite of misery.

01:15:49.193 --> 01:15:51.494
It takes days to dehydrate, doesn't it?

01:15:51.528 --> 01:15:52.661
There's got to be an easier way

01:15:52.695 --> 01:15:54.330
than this to establish disgusting

01:15:54.364 --> 01:15:56.198
quantities of wealth and power.

01:15:56.232 --> 01:15:58.134
If only there was a way
to do it from a hammock.

01:15:58.168 --> 01:15:59.701
You don't strike me as the
take over the world type.

01:15:59.735 --> 01:16:02.303
Not take over, rule.

01:16:02.337 --> 01:16:04.473
(laughs) There's a big difference.

01:16:04.507 --> 01:16:06.175
Taking over takes all the work!

01:16:06.209 --> 01:16:07.811
Somebody else does that.

01:16:07.845 --> 01:16:09.946
Contractors likely.

01:16:09.980 --> 01:16:11.880
We simply rule over a previously

01:16:11.914 --> 01:16:14.850
conquered Empire from a quiet den.

01:16:16.352 --> 01:16:18.488
Let's walk to The Oracle.

01:16:19.655 --> 01:16:20.990
[Oracle] There they are.

01:16:21.024 --> 01:16:22.192
[Sol] You're not interested in

01:16:22.226 --> 01:16:23.192
letting The Witch Warrior find you?

01:16:23.226 --> 01:16:24.294
Just because I haven't died yet

01:16:24.328 --> 01:16:27.162
doesn't mean I wanna push my luck.

01:16:27.196 --> 01:16:29.432
What's going to happen
to The Empire without me?

01:16:29.466 --> 01:16:31.867
Oh, I think we'll survive.

01:16:31.901 --> 01:16:34.269
Here, Cleo will love these.

01:16:34.303 --> 01:16:36.071
I've got one better.

01:16:36.105 --> 01:16:37.874
She loves these flowers.

01:16:37.908 --> 01:16:42.277
Take the shoes, trust me.

01:16:42.311 --> 01:16:44.880
I'm sorry I took your head off.

01:16:44.914 --> 01:16:46.316
How'd you come back?

01:16:46.350 --> 01:16:47.650
What good is an Oracle
if she tells her secrets?

01:16:47.684 --> 01:16:50.385
You think anyone can do what I do?

01:16:50.419 --> 01:16:52.021
Now go.

01:16:52.055 --> 01:16:53.255
You kids are a long time away from

01:16:53.289 --> 01:16:55.692
happiness and babies, nothing's over yet.

01:16:55.726 --> 01:16:57.627
Happiness and what?

01:17:01.765 --> 01:17:03.366
Have you heard of The Isle De Roca?

01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:06.436
You mean the secret island
of Lemorian survivors.

01:17:06.470 --> 01:17:08.705
Home to untold tons of wealth?

01:17:08.739 --> 01:17:09.872
We might have.

01:17:09.906 --> 01:17:11.273
[Cleo] If I gave you a map to it,

01:17:11.307 --> 01:17:12.474
would you forget about
The Oracle and let me go?

01:17:12.508 --> 01:17:13.876
[Warrior] So you can go after Sol?

01:17:13.910 --> 01:17:16.278
Are you trying to make
more trouble for yourself?

01:17:16.312 --> 01:17:17.647
Yes.

01:17:17.681 --> 01:17:19.848
Think we could pay someone
to take this bomb off?

01:17:19.882 --> 01:17:22.919
Fine, you produce this map, you're

01:17:22.953 --> 01:17:25.821
free to get yourself
killed by someone else.

01:17:34.397 --> 01:17:36.499
Hmmm, this is better
than ruling The Empire.

01:17:36.533 --> 01:17:38.834
We could buy a whole country and retire.

01:17:38.868 --> 01:17:41.137
Thank you.

01:17:41.171 --> 01:17:42.638
Thank you.

01:17:42.672 --> 01:17:43.473
Get going then...

01:17:43.507 --> 01:17:45.508
Oh, bugger!

01:17:46.976 --> 01:17:49.178
But I had it under control.

01:17:49.212 --> 01:17:51.013
I know what I'm doing.

01:17:53.650 --> 01:17:54.317
Oh sh...

01:17:54.351 --> 01:17:56.653
(groaning)

01:17:57.788 --> 01:17:59.254
What's going on?

01:17:59.288 --> 01:18:01.889
No one's ever escape The King, ever!

01:18:01.923 --> 01:18:02.858
Well he couldn't have escaped unless

01:18:02.892 --> 01:18:04.826
he killed The King, right?

01:18:04.860 --> 01:18:07.796
Of course right, so you must've killed him.

01:18:07.830 --> 01:18:09.999
And killing The King means
you've become The King.

01:18:10.033 --> 01:18:12.701
So you are The King now!

01:18:12.735 --> 01:18:14.771
You're actually on the right track.

01:18:14.805 --> 01:18:16.439
All right.

01:18:17.740 --> 01:18:18.641
[Cleo] Really?

01:18:18.675 --> 01:18:19.909
Okay, you have to listen to him.

01:18:19.943 --> 01:18:22.745
In theory, yes, but, you know,

01:18:22.779 --> 01:18:27.150
unless I replace him...

01:18:27.184 --> 01:18:30.620
Wealth, power.

01:18:30.654 --> 01:18:32.155
You can have it all!

01:18:32.189 --> 01:18:34.557
My wonderful kingdom of dirt, take it.

01:18:34.591 --> 01:18:36.025
It doesn't work like that.

01:18:36.059 --> 01:18:38.728
You see, you have to die,
or someone will find out.

01:18:38.762 --> 01:18:39.861
I can keep a secret.

01:18:39.895 --> 01:18:43.232
(laughing, coughing)

01:18:44.735 --> 01:18:46.436
Fight me.

01:18:49.105 --> 01:18:50.706
What...

01:18:52.242 --> 01:18:57.747
(action music)

01:19:13.062 --> 01:19:15.464
(growling)

01:19:20.070 --> 01:19:22.038
Ah, oooh, ah, ah!

01:19:29.613 --> 01:19:30.912
[Warrior] To the death!

01:19:30.946 --> 01:19:34.650
You will die so we can be King!

01:19:36.352 --> 01:19:37.553
In just a minute.

01:19:37.587 --> 01:19:38.388
Catch us!

01:19:38.422 --> 01:19:39.854
We don't have to.

01:19:39.888 --> 01:19:42.924
We will pay every assassin
on Earth to find you.

01:19:42.958 --> 01:19:45.794
Everywhere you go, your
names will be known.

01:19:45.828 --> 01:19:47.030
Even the West won't take you in

01:19:47.064 --> 01:19:49.432
because whoever takes
you in will be murdered.

01:19:49.466 --> 01:19:50.900
Their children will be murdered.

01:19:50.934 --> 01:19:52.835
Anyone who sees your face and doesn't

01:19:52.869 --> 01:19:55.737
try to kill you will be murdered.

01:19:55.771 --> 01:19:58.540
There will be no end to your suffering.

01:19:58.574 --> 01:20:00.543
So fight me.

01:20:00.577 --> 01:20:01.878
Fight me.

01:20:01.912 --> 01:20:02.644
Fight me!

01:20:02.678 --> 01:20:04.080
(sneezes)

01:20:04.114 --> 01:20:05.781
Does he count?

01:20:07.316 --> 01:20:08.851
Fight me!

01:20:08.885 --> 01:20:13.388
Come on, fight me, fight me!

01:20:13.422 --> 01:20:15.425
Fight me!

01:20:20.029 --> 01:20:25.000
(buzzing, whirring)

01:20:25.034 --> 01:20:27.703
(machine running)

01:20:29.739 --> 01:20:32.841
(crunching)

01:20:35.244 --> 01:20:36.379
Now look what you've done!

01:20:36.413 --> 01:20:38.815
It is extremely uncomfortable.

01:20:40.050 --> 01:20:41.817
Cleo, come here.

01:20:41.851 --> 01:20:44.920
Get us out and you can have the map back.

01:20:44.954 --> 01:20:48.524
We're not going to explode, see?

01:20:50.694 --> 01:20:54.263
Right, one last thing, you're dead!

01:20:54.297 --> 01:20:55.130
(beep)

01:20:55.164 --> 01:20:57.767
Oh...

01:20:57.801 --> 01:21:00.637
(coughing)

01:21:05.141 --> 01:21:06.409
(machine running)

01:21:06.443 --> 01:21:09.711
Oh no, that's terrible inconvenient.

01:21:09.745 --> 01:21:15.184
(dramatic music)

01:21:28.431 --> 01:21:30.799
(muffled gasp)

01:21:30.833 --> 01:21:35.204
(machine whirring, crunching)

01:21:35.238 --> 01:21:36.873
(beep)

01:21:42.244 --> 01:21:44.180
(beep)

01:21:45.548 --> 01:21:48.350
Don't worry about the
gas, sir, it's temporary.

01:21:51.520 --> 01:21:55.090
You and The Oracle just had
to get involved, didn't you?

01:21:56.258 --> 01:21:58.494
Women, I swear they'll be the death of me.

01:21:58.528 --> 01:21:59.394
(zapping)

01:21:59.428 --> 01:22:02.998
Here we go, okay, okay.

01:22:04.935 --> 01:22:06.468
(fizzes out)

01:22:06.502 --> 01:22:09.138
Got it... Gah!

01:22:09.172 --> 01:22:12.442
I'll have to reset you at my outpost.

01:22:14.644 --> 01:22:16.512
What the...

01:22:24.186 --> 01:22:29.157
Oh, ooo, you almost took him away from me.

01:22:29.191 --> 01:22:31.894
And you killed my Witch Warrior!

01:22:34.263 --> 01:22:36.365
I really liked that one.

01:22:43.973 --> 01:22:46.409
You love Sol, don't you?

01:22:48.445 --> 01:22:49.911
When the paralysis wears off, I

01:22:49.945 --> 01:22:51.446
hope you come find him.

01:22:51.480 --> 01:22:53.348
See, I'm resetting his memory.

01:22:53.382 --> 01:22:55.151
You'll be a stranger to him.

01:22:55.185 --> 01:22:57.253
In fact, he'll probably kill you.

01:22:57.287 --> 01:22:59.287
I want you to understand this.

01:22:59.321 --> 01:23:00.923
Whatever you and The Oracle think

01:23:00.957 --> 01:23:05.361
you've accomplished, I'm undoing it.

01:23:06.562 --> 01:23:10.299
Come on, Sol, let's get you back home.

01:23:10.333 --> 01:23:12.802
(grunting)

01:23:18.040 --> 01:23:23.546
(dramatic music)

01:25:47.390 --> 01:25:49.458
(phone ringing)

01:25:58.901 --> 01:25:59.869
Hello?

01:25:59.903 --> 01:26:01.904
[Oracle] Sweetheart!

01:27:05.168 --> 01:27:10.205
(eerie music)

01:27:11.807 --> 01:27:15.610
Whoever you are, you
don't belong in that chair!

01:27:16.678 --> 01:27:18.213
Get out!

01:27:26.655 --> 01:27:28.790
Hello!

01:27:28.824 --> 01:27:31.227
Get off there!

01:27:31.261 --> 01:27:33.162
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

01:27:34.663 --> 01:27:36.732
But I have to sit down.

01:27:36.766 --> 01:27:39.101
I hurt my leg, see?

01:27:39.135 --> 01:27:41.001
My daddy made that crutch for me.

01:27:41.035 --> 01:27:42.705
What are you doing with it?

01:27:42.739 --> 01:27:45.941
He tried to take it away too,
but I wanted to dance with it.

01:27:45.975 --> 01:27:48.009
He asked me what kind of dancing do I do.

01:27:48.043 --> 01:27:50.411
So I showed him, I showed him good.

01:27:50.445 --> 01:27:54.182
I danced with Daddy.

01:27:56.785 --> 01:27:58.187
Would you like to dance with me?

01:27:58.221 --> 01:27:59.722
The Oracle said you would.

01:27:59.756 --> 01:28:01.523
Absolutely not!

01:28:01.557 --> 01:28:03.826
The King may return at
any moment, so get...

01:28:03.860 --> 01:28:06.161
Ooooooh...

01:28:06.195 --> 01:28:07.929
You get off there!

01:28:07.963 --> 01:28:10.532
Mmmmm, no.

01:28:10.566 --> 01:28:12.300
You do as I say!

01:28:12.334 --> 01:28:13.569
No.

01:28:16.071 --> 01:28:17.605
(gasp)

01:28:19.074 --> 01:28:20.508
(yelp)

01:28:34.790 --> 01:28:37.159
Disobeying me...

01:28:37.193 --> 01:28:40.495
Is the same as disobeying The King himself.

01:29:17.199 --> 01:29:19.667
Ah, ahhh!

01:29:22.571 --> 01:29:24.774
(giggling)

01:29:26.476 --> 01:29:29.178
I got your spine, didn't I?

01:29:34.583 --> 01:29:36.651
Ooooo...

01:29:39.888 --> 01:29:43.124
We can dance for a long time now.

01:29:52.869 --> 01:29:58.374
(harmonic music)

01:30:48.091 --> 01:30:49.525
[Cleo] Sol!

01:30:55.030 --> 01:30:56.832
Who are you?

01:30:58.935 --> 01:31:00.369
How do you know my name?

01:31:00.403 --> 01:31:03.405
It's me, Cleo.

01:31:03.439 --> 01:31:04.305
You know me.

01:31:04.339 --> 01:31:05.406
Lady, I don't know you.

01:31:05.440 --> 01:31:07.543
Did he fix your eyes?

01:31:07.577 --> 01:31:08.643
Can you see my face with those eyes?

01:31:08.677 --> 01:31:10.613
I can see your face.

01:31:11.980 --> 01:31:13.147
Look, I'm sure you're a lovely

01:31:13.181 --> 01:31:14.616
woman, but I don't have time for you.

01:31:14.650 --> 01:31:17.286
Wait, don't you at
least recognize my voice?

01:31:18.620 --> 01:31:19.821
No!

01:31:19.855 --> 01:31:22.690
Well what's the last thing you remember?

01:31:24.961 --> 01:31:25.827
See?

01:31:25.861 --> 01:31:27.595
A prison, I was in prison.

01:31:27.629 --> 01:31:31.200
My memory's fine, you're confused, leave!

01:31:31.234 --> 01:31:33.669
No, I know you.

01:31:33.703 --> 01:31:35.737
I wouldn't have done that if I were you.

01:31:35.771 --> 01:31:36.671
Let me go.

01:31:36.705 --> 01:31:38.874
Before you get hurt, let me go.

01:31:38.908 --> 01:31:42.478
I can't, I can't.

01:31:42.512 --> 01:31:43.644
