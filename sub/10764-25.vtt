00:19.586 --> 00:21.110
Hey, beautiful.

00:23.323 --> 00:26.383
I love a woman with good reflexes.
Makes me crazy.

00:27.193 --> 00:28.217
Get out.

00:28.294 --> 00:32.320
Your mouth is saying "get out,"
but your eyes are saying "get busy."

00:34.267 --> 00:35.427
Daddy.

00:36.302 --> 00:38.634
That's not going to work this time,
Hil, darling.

00:38.705 --> 00:42.664
Uncle Phil went to the supermarket,
so he'll be gone for at least a week.

00:45.879 --> 00:46.903
Mom.

00:49.649 --> 00:51.276
She went with him.

00:53.019 --> 00:54.213
Geoffrey.

00:57.123 --> 00:59.819
- Yes, Miss Hilary?
- You know the drill.

01:09.669 --> 01:13.867
Hilary, why is it so hard for you to be nice
to Jazz? You know he likes you.

01:13.940 --> 01:16.773
I'm supposed to be nice to everyone
who likes me?

01:16.843 --> 01:19.209
How much time do you think I have?

01:20.547 --> 01:22.947
So that's the reason
for you to be mean to Jazz?

01:23.016 --> 01:26.713
- Look, Jazz will be fine.
- You think so? Well, I don't.

01:26.786 --> 01:30.654
You don't know Jazz the way I know him.
He's a very sensitive person.

01:30.723 --> 01:33.191
He has feelings that are very deep.

01:33.626 --> 01:37.392
When you had Geoffrey throw him out,
I think that was the last straw.

01:37.997 --> 01:41.797
- I don't think he'll ever be the same.
- Really?

01:43.603 --> 01:45.434
Want to kiss my boo-boo?

02:58.077 --> 03:02.309
I hope that you didn't take my throwing
you out of the house personally, Mr. Jazz.

03:02.382 --> 03:05.840
- It was strictly business.
- That's cool.

03:06.052 --> 03:09.283
If you grab me in that place again,
we're engaged.

03:13.092 --> 03:16.528
Look, Jazz, if you want to get with Hilary...

03:16.596 --> 03:18.223
you got to have a plan.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.030
You mean mine hasn't been working?

03:21.434 --> 03:24.301
Jazz, that's the 18th time
she threw you out of the house.

03:24.370 --> 03:26.201
All a part of my plan.

03:27.307 --> 03:28.535
We're home.

03:28.608 --> 03:29.734
Later.

03:31.144 --> 03:34.204
- Geoffrey, the groceries are in the kitchen.
- Yes, madam.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.176
- Carlton has sunk to a new low.
- What?

03:40.553 --> 03:44.489
- Carlton, what's up with the crutches?
- I'm practicing my new scam.

03:44.557 --> 03:47.219
Girls love a guy with a sports injury.

03:48.228 --> 03:50.594
I can't see too many honeys
being impressed by:

03:50.663 --> 03:53.791
"Babe, I busted myself up
playing peewee football."

03:56.169 --> 03:59.002
Mom, Dad, I'm so glad you're home.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.132
- I have exciting news about my job.
- What is it?

04:02.375 --> 04:05.572
I'm not going to just tell you.
That's no fun. Guess.

04:05.645 --> 04:08.375
- Did you sell a painting at the gallery?
- No.

04:08.448 --> 04:11.042
- Did you get a promotion?
- No.

04:11.117 --> 04:13.915
- Did you get fired?
- No, I quit.

04:13.987 --> 04:16.820
- What?
- I was definitely the closest.

04:18.891 --> 04:21.325
Hilary, you were doing so well
at the art gallery.

04:21.394 --> 04:23.862
Yeah, but, Mom, it's not really a cool job.

04:23.930 --> 04:25.795
When I was a little girl, I had a dream...

04:25.865 --> 04:29.028
that when I grew up, I'd have
a glamorous job in a glamorous office.

04:29.102 --> 04:32.037
At parties, people would ask
what I did and I'd tell them.

04:32.105 --> 04:34.835
I imagined them turning pea-green
with envy and blurting out:

04:34.907 --> 04:37.705
"You are so lucky,"
and walking away eaten up inside...

04:37.777 --> 04:40.644
because I had a fabulous job
and they didn't.

04:42.181 --> 04:45.412
They say Gandhi
had a very similar childhood dream.

04:47.320 --> 04:51.051
All right, young lady, how do you propose
to get this glamorous job?

04:51.124 --> 04:52.751
I already got it.

04:52.992 --> 04:56.018
Starting tomorrow,
I'm going to be the personal assistant...

04:56.095 --> 04:57.892
to Marissa Redman.

04:57.964 --> 05:00.762
- The movie star?
- Wow, she's really big.

05:00.833 --> 05:03.324
What? She ain't do nothing good in years.

05:03.403 --> 05:06.964
That's not true. She's one of the most
famous actresses in Hollywood.

05:07.040 --> 05:09.702
- She won an Oscar.
- Nominated.

05:09.776 --> 05:13.177
And she was in one of the top 10 movies
of all time.

05:13.246 --> 05:14.838
Eight years ago.

05:16.349 --> 05:18.317
And she needs a new assistant...

05:18.384 --> 05:21.012
because she just got back
from a well-deserved year off.

05:21.087 --> 05:22.349
Nose job.

05:24.190 --> 05:26.351
How did you know all of that?

05:26.993 --> 05:28.893
I have an inquiring mind.

05:30.096 --> 05:33.657
Will, please. Hilary's obviously
very excited about this job.

05:33.733 --> 05:35.564
Be a little more supportive.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.602
You're right. I'm sorry.

05:37.670 --> 05:41.572
Hilary, I loved her in that musical she did.
God, what a voice.

05:41.841 --> 05:43.103
Lip-synch.

05:45.845 --> 05:47.472
Dinner is served.

05:54.821 --> 05:57.551
- Jazz, I thought you left.
- Why?

05:58.358 --> 06:01.555
Because you walked out the door
and you said, "Later."

06:01.627 --> 06:03.424
All a part of my plan.

06:05.365 --> 06:08.994
- Did you hear the news about Hilary?
- Yeah. I'm so proud of her.

06:09.068 --> 06:12.094
Okay, tomorrow's her first day at work.

06:12.171 --> 06:15.834
I think I got a little plan
that will make Hilary like you.

06:15.908 --> 06:17.341
Tomorrow we'll go down there...

06:17.410 --> 06:20.140
and you're gonna surprise her
with flowers and candy.

06:20.213 --> 06:22.977
Cool. Meet you here tomorrow
at 9:00 sharp.

06:23.049 --> 06:26.075
- You got it, man.
- Don't forget the candy and flowers.

06:28.054 --> 06:29.919
Miss Tony Fisher, please.

06:30.823 --> 06:32.586
Hi, Tony. It's Hil.

06:33.359 --> 06:35.054
How's your job going?

06:37.897 --> 06:41.697
Guess where I'm calling from. No, guess.

06:42.668 --> 06:44.101
No, guess again.

06:47.206 --> 06:49.868
What do you mean you give up?
This is fun.

06:50.143 --> 06:51.838
No, guess again.

06:55.548 --> 06:59.245
No, don't hang up, Tony.
Do not hang up now. Come on, guess.

07:00.186 --> 07:01.744
No, guess again.

07:05.124 --> 07:09.060
Okay, I'm in Marissa Redman's office.

07:10.129 --> 07:11.994
No, it's my first day.

07:12.432 --> 07:13.899
What's she like?

07:13.966 --> 07:17.629
Tony, I have to tell you,
you'd never know she was a movie star.

07:17.703 --> 07:20.194
I mean, she's so grounded. She's so real.

07:20.273 --> 07:22.571
I don't care
if you have other appointments, clown.

07:22.642 --> 07:24.371
My cat needs acupuncture.

07:29.816 --> 07:31.647
- Marissa.
- Heather.

07:31.717 --> 07:34.413
- Hilary.
- Let's get one thing straight.

07:34.487 --> 07:37.684
My last assistant quit on me
because I never learned her name.

07:37.757 --> 07:39.884
Now, is that going to be a problem?

07:40.827 --> 07:42.795
- No.
- Good.

07:44.230 --> 07:47.597
I'm so excited. I want to learn
all about the movie business.

07:47.667 --> 07:50.500
And you will. The key is to be positive.

07:50.770 --> 07:52.465
I like positive people.

07:52.538 --> 07:54.904
- Are you positive?
- Yes! Yes.

07:57.743 --> 08:00.075
Remember, this is a process.

08:00.613 --> 08:02.478
You do realize it's a process?

08:02.548 --> 08:05.540
Yes. I'm positive it's a process.

08:08.588 --> 08:11.148
- I'll get that.
- You got that right.

08:12.558 --> 08:14.219
Miss Redman's office.

08:14.594 --> 08:18.291
I'm afraid Miss Redman's
on the other line now, Mr. Haskell...

08:18.364 --> 08:21.333
- but I'll see if she's finishing up.
- It's my agent.

08:22.301 --> 08:25.327
Hello, Sam. This better be good news.

08:26.739 --> 08:29.105
So you're saying I didn't get the part?

08:29.642 --> 08:32.236
I know the part called
for a Meryl Streep type.

08:32.311 --> 08:35.144
Yes, I'm a Meryl Streep type
if I want to be.

08:36.482 --> 08:38.609
It's called acting, Sam.

08:39.684 --> 08:41.585
So what fool got the part?

08:42.855 --> 08:44.618
Meryl Streep.

08:47.093 --> 08:48.583
Ain't that cozy?

08:52.498 --> 08:56.594
I'm sorry you didn't get the part, Marissa.
But let's be positive.

08:56.669 --> 08:58.762
After all, this is a process.

09:01.440 --> 09:02.964
Shut up.

09:05.111 --> 09:07.170
I have to go
to a restaurant opening tonight.

09:07.246 --> 09:10.238
So I need you to pick up my clothes
from the cleaners.

09:10.650 --> 09:14.882
I'm not speaking to my tired boyfriend,
so I'll need someone to go with.

09:15.655 --> 09:18.749
I wonder if that cute
little Johnny Gill is free.

09:20.259 --> 09:24.252
- Isn't he, like, my age?
- I see. I get it.

09:24.330 --> 09:26.821
First, I'm too black
to play Meryl Streep's parts...

09:26.899 --> 09:29.129
and now I'm too old to date a 20-year-old.

09:29.201 --> 09:31.294
Cher can do it, but I can't?

09:31.737 --> 09:33.898
No, Marissa, I didn't mean
anything like that.

09:33.973 --> 09:37.306
Everyone's trying to fit me
into their nice, neat little box.

09:37.376 --> 09:40.709
You're walking a fine line, Helena.
A very fine line.

09:49.388 --> 09:52.050
Hello, I'm calling
from Marissa Redman's office.

09:52.124 --> 09:54.092
Is her dry-cleaning ready?

09:54.327 --> 09:55.954
It says here on the ticket:

09:56.028 --> 09:59.259
"Three dresses, two blouses,
four silk brassieres...

09:59.332 --> 10:01.357
"and eight pair of underwear."

10:01.434 --> 10:03.834
Fantastic. I'll be right over
to pick them up.

10:03.903 --> 10:05.495
Glamour, glamour, glamour.

10:07.139 --> 10:08.834
You know, while you're down there...

10:08.908 --> 10:11.877
you may even get to see
Dustin Hoffman's drawers.

10:14.580 --> 10:16.810
Will, what are you doing here?

10:21.253 --> 10:23.744
Congratulations on your new job, Hilary.

10:23.823 --> 10:27.224
Flowers, a Kit Kat...

10:32.098 --> 10:33.429
and a song.

10:35.234 --> 10:37.532
All the way from Compton, California...

10:37.603 --> 10:40.367
the king of the keyboard himself,
just for you, Hilary.

10:40.439 --> 10:41.929
It's Jazz!

10:46.946 --> 10:50.643
- He plays so beautiful. Don't you agree?
- What is going on here?

10:50.716 --> 10:53.708
- Marissa, I can explain.
- I don't even want to hear it.

10:53.786 --> 10:56.482
So I've got a party girl on my hands.
Is that it?

10:56.555 --> 10:58.455
As soon as I turn my back.

10:59.358 --> 11:02.054
We've got a word for people
like you in this business...

11:02.128 --> 11:04.119
and it's called... Hello.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.460
Miss Redman, we didn't mean
to get Hilary in any trouble.

11:10.536 --> 11:13.300
- I'm her cousin.
- She's not in any trouble.

11:13.372 --> 11:15.840
I'm sorry. I didn't catch your name.

11:16.175 --> 11:17.472
Will Smith.

11:19.245 --> 11:23.113
Little Willie Smith. I like that.

11:24.183 --> 11:27.311
Yeah, but little Willie's got to go now.

11:31.157 --> 11:34.388
- We'll get right out of your way.
- No, you're not in my way.

11:34.460 --> 11:36.325
Well, you kind of are.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.726
Why don't you stay for a little while?

11:41.467 --> 11:44.493
You know, we'd love to,
but we made other plans.

11:44.737 --> 11:46.204
No, we didn't.

11:46.872 --> 11:48.100
Don't you remember, Jazz...

11:48.174 --> 11:50.802
you've got
that brain-surgery appointment.

11:51.677 --> 11:54.544
- Must have forgotten.
- Bye-bye.

11:56.082 --> 11:57.572
You know, I just had a thought.

11:57.650 --> 11:59.948
I'm sure it's brilliant. What is it?

12:00.019 --> 12:04.353
I thought I'd like to take your cousin Will
to that restaurant opening tonight.

12:04.423 --> 12:08.018
- What?
- Are you thinking I'm too old for him?

12:08.094 --> 12:10.153
You think he wouldn't want
to go out with me?

12:10.229 --> 12:13.323
No, Marissa, I mean,
who wouldn't want to go out with you?

12:13.399 --> 12:15.333
You better hope he does.

12:15.401 --> 12:19.701
Because if he doesn't want to go out
with me tonight, you're fired, Hester.

12:44.463 --> 12:46.158
I forfeit the game.

12:49.769 --> 12:52.533
Thanks a lot, G. He was about to take me.

13:01.747 --> 13:03.044
Hi, Will.

13:04.216 --> 13:07.083
Look who's home. It's Miss Hollywood.

13:09.221 --> 13:11.781
Tell me all about your faboo day.

13:13.025 --> 13:14.822
So what did you do this afternoon?

13:14.894 --> 13:17.863
Massage her feet, give her cat a perm?

13:20.132 --> 13:23.226
Will, I love your irreverent sense of humor.

13:23.502 --> 13:25.231
It's so refreshing.

13:26.272 --> 13:28.502
How you trying to play me, Hilary?

13:29.041 --> 13:31.601
Will, you're always thinking
the worst of me.

13:32.344 --> 13:34.574
I have got some great news for you.

13:34.647 --> 13:36.547
Guess who I can get to go out with you.

13:37.082 --> 13:39.744
- Janet Jackson?
- Guess again.

13:40.085 --> 13:42.212
- Jody Watley.
- Guess again.

13:42.688 --> 13:44.417
Tell me, or I'll kill you.

13:45.758 --> 13:47.555
Marissa Redman.

13:50.796 --> 13:52.855
You've got to be tripping.

13:54.767 --> 13:57.759
Hilary, I wouldn't go out with her
if she and Marsha Warfield...

13:57.837 --> 13:59.930
were the last two women on earth.

14:01.407 --> 14:02.999
Will, please.

14:03.075 --> 14:06.841
Marissa said if I can't get you to go out
on a date with her, she'll fire me.

14:07.246 --> 14:11.205
Perfect. All she does is yell at you,
boss you around and treat you like dirt.

14:12.017 --> 14:13.177
I know...

14:14.119 --> 14:16.713
but I'm the envy of all my friends.

14:28.901 --> 14:30.664
Hilary, come on, don't cry.

14:30.736 --> 14:34.604
Don't cry. Okay. All right. Okay.

14:34.673 --> 14:37.574
I guess it won't kill me
to go out with Marissa Redman.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.235
Will, thank you.

14:40.212 --> 14:43.147
And I guess it won't kill you
to go out with Jazz.

14:59.198 --> 15:02.565
I can't believe that you agreed
to go on this date with Jazz.

15:02.635 --> 15:05.399
Shut up, Carlton.
I had to, or I'd lose my job.

15:05.971 --> 15:07.461
Touchy.

15:11.577 --> 15:12.942
Cut it out!

15:13.012 --> 15:17.210
I can see it now. Mr. And Mrs. Jazz...

15:18.484 --> 15:21.976
- Does Jazz have a last name?
- I believe it's Matazz.

15:26.859 --> 15:29.157
Will you three cut it out?

15:29.228 --> 15:31.287
Philip, we don't mean anything by it.

15:31.363 --> 15:35.299
I don't see the destruction of our
gene pool as something to joke about.

15:39.138 --> 15:42.107
- That must be Jazz.
- Marissa's meeting us at the restaurant.

15:42.174 --> 15:45.200
- We can't be a second late.
- Relax, Hilary.

15:45.277 --> 15:48.974
Just make sure you're sweet to Jazz.
This is making his whole week.

15:49.415 --> 15:51.940
- Mr. Jazz.
- Yo, G.

15:52.017 --> 15:56.317
As of tonight,
my new official name is Mr. Lucky.

16:02.394 --> 16:06.524
Marissa, thanks for inviting us.
This is such an exciting new restaurant.

16:08.567 --> 16:11.331
Look at that. Butter on ice.

16:11.870 --> 16:13.633
I'm living large now.

16:16.342 --> 16:18.776
Speaking of ice, Jazz...

16:18.844 --> 16:22.302
- doesn't Hilary look a little chilly?
- Right.

16:28.620 --> 16:32.784
- You are so beautiful, baby.
- Jazz, please.

16:33.258 --> 16:35.818
Now, I know you can be nicer than that.

16:36.462 --> 16:37.759
All right.

16:38.263 --> 16:42.393
That was a wonderful imitation
of a creepy spider you just did, Jazz.

16:43.769 --> 16:47.102
Hey, Cher! Sophomore in high school.

16:47.172 --> 16:48.764
Beat that, honey.

16:53.512 --> 16:56.003
Do you know what time it is, Hilary?

16:56.181 --> 16:57.773
It's 8:15.

16:58.283 --> 16:59.716
No, it's not.

16:59.985 --> 17:02.385
It's "slow dancing with Jazz" time.

17:03.422 --> 17:05.083
No, it isn't.

17:05.324 --> 17:08.020
You know, it's either
"slow dancing with Jazz" time...

17:08.093 --> 17:11.858
or "Will getting up, going home,
and leaving you without a job" time.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.289
Jazz, do you want to dance?

17:15.367 --> 17:17.528
Man, this must be my birthday.

17:18.637 --> 17:21.538
When you get back,
bring me a mineral water...

17:21.607 --> 17:24.075
three ice cubes, a lemon, and a lime.

17:24.143 --> 17:27.442
For the sake of novelty,
get it right this time.

17:27.512 --> 17:29.037
Yes, Marissa.

17:32.451 --> 17:36.410
So, little Willie,
would you pass me the salt, please?

17:36.789 --> 17:37.813
Sure.

17:50.369 --> 17:53.236
Jazz, I feel I should tell you something.

17:53.839 --> 17:57.104
I'm only on this date with you
as part of my deal with Will.

17:57.342 --> 17:59.640
- I know.
- You do?

18:00.345 --> 18:02.074
It doesn't bother me...

18:02.448 --> 18:06.646
but if it's making you feel sad
dancing with me, you don't have to.

18:06.718 --> 18:09.380
- No, Jazz, it's not that.
- Thank God.

18:11.824 --> 18:15.351
It's just this job is getting to me.
I don't mind the hard work.

18:15.427 --> 18:19.591
It's just I can't seem to do anything right.
She's always yelling at me.

18:20.532 --> 18:22.796
Tell Jazz all about it.

18:24.470 --> 18:28.133
Look. Biggest director in town. Sydney.

18:29.741 --> 18:32.505
Congratulations. Loved your new movie.

18:32.578 --> 18:34.170
We've got to do...

18:34.980 --> 18:38.279
What? He just looked right through me.

18:38.750 --> 18:41.344
Maybe you should have spoken up
a little bit.

18:42.020 --> 18:44.682
This is not good. Hickory!

18:46.892 --> 18:47.984
Yes.

18:48.894 --> 18:51.226
I just saw Sydney, and he cut me dead.

18:51.296 --> 18:54.094
Did you send him a bottle of champagne
like I told you...

18:54.166 --> 18:56.464
for the premiere of his crappy movie?

18:56.535 --> 18:59.732
You said this morning you were thinking
of sending him something...

18:59.805 --> 19:01.329
but didn't know what.

19:01.406 --> 19:05.570
Champagne would obviously
be the perfect choice, Einstein.

19:06.078 --> 19:08.308
Marissa, chill. Come on. She's trying.

19:08.380 --> 19:10.314
Look, I work so hard.

19:10.382 --> 19:13.579
I mean, I work harder than anybody,
and I'm very underpaid...

19:13.652 --> 19:17.179
and it does not help when the person
who is supposed to be my assistant...

19:17.256 --> 19:18.951
is a total idiot.

19:19.024 --> 19:21.515
- You're the idiot.
- Well, date's over.

19:23.996 --> 19:26.521
Look, I don't care
how many movies you make.

19:26.598 --> 19:28.623
Nobody don't talk like that to Hilary.

19:28.700 --> 19:32.329
She's smart, sweet, and the most
beautiful woman in the cosmos...

19:32.404 --> 19:34.167
and she's been very nice to me tonight.

19:34.239 --> 19:37.436
She's been nice to you,
even though you didn't deserve it.

19:37.509 --> 19:41.104
So you tell her you're sorry
because I'm about to get pretty mad.

19:46.385 --> 19:48.046
Shut up.

19:48.787 --> 19:51.585
This is what you do.
Run to an all-night liquor store...

19:51.657 --> 19:54.091
- No.
- Excuse me?

19:54.159 --> 19:55.990
What do you think I am?

19:56.061 --> 19:59.758
I shouldn't be treated like an idiot.
I'm not an idiot. I'm smart.

19:59.998 --> 20:04.162
And another thing, your last five movies
really sucked big time.

20:07.506 --> 20:08.632
Six.

20:09.741 --> 20:12.608
You can't stand here
talking like that to me.

20:12.678 --> 20:15.146
You're right,
because I have a prior engagement...

20:15.214 --> 20:17.182
with someone from the A list.

20:17.649 --> 20:19.446
Come on, Jazz, let's go.

20:19.551 --> 20:21.382
Thank you, oh, Lord.

20:32.197 --> 20:35.655
Who needs them?
They don't know how to appreciate you.

20:35.901 --> 20:39.428
I mean, I think me and you can have
a better time without them.

20:39.504 --> 20:41.802
- Really?
- Psych.

20:49.214 --> 20:51.409
You really said that to Marissa?

20:52.417 --> 20:56.478
At least now Marissa the cradle crook
knows what Hilary thinks about her.

20:57.122 --> 20:59.056
And I owe it all to Jazz.

21:00.025 --> 21:03.153
Thank you, Jazz.
Now my daughter's unemployed.

21:03.662 --> 21:05.391
Daddy, you should thank Jazz.

21:05.464 --> 21:08.194
He reminded me
that I do have some self-respect.

21:08.267 --> 21:12.294
Why chase after celebrities?
They're all so shallow and self-centered.

21:13.772 --> 21:17.037
From now on, I want to spend time
with people who have depth...

21:17.109 --> 21:19.202
intelligence, and maturity.

21:19.845 --> 21:21.836
I don't like the sound of this.

21:22.814 --> 21:25.374
- Good night, sweetheart.
- Good night, Mommy.

21:25.450 --> 21:27.350
- Good night, guys.
- Good night.

21:27.419 --> 21:28.579
Night, baby.

21:31.857 --> 21:33.950
Guys, I'm sorry the night was so awful.

21:34.026 --> 21:37.018
Hilary, I'm just grateful
I got my young body out of there...

21:37.095 --> 21:39.461
before old Marissa put some miles on it.

21:41.166 --> 21:42.428
I got to go.

21:42.501 --> 21:44.196
- Peace.
- Peace, babe.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.302
Jazz, wait.

21:54.279 --> 21:57.942
Listen. Thank you. I mean...

22:00.919 --> 22:03.615
- Thanks.
- Sure, babe.

22:06.091 --> 22:08.958
You want to go out with me
on Saturday night?

22:10.128 --> 22:11.561
I don't think it's a good time.

22:11.630 --> 22:14.565
I'd only say "yes"
because I felt like I owed you something.

22:14.633 --> 22:16.328
That's cool with me.

22:17.869 --> 22:19.461
Maybe some other time.

22:20.872 --> 22:22.897
Okay. Good night, Hilary.

22:24.643 --> 22:25.905
No, wait.

22:41.026 --> 22:42.755
All a part of my plan.
