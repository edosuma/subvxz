00:08.039 --> 00:13.000
I'm just saying, as a team veteran, to the new guy,
heavy lunch before mission departure, bad idea.

00:13.040 --> 00:15.920
<i>And even with the inertial dampners, this whole
flying thing is best done on an empty stomach.</i>

00:15.960 --> 00:17.640
Yeah well, I've got a pretty strong stomach.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.080
Hey, I can eat frozen dinners without thawing
and sometimes it doesn't even affects me.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.320
McKay!

00:21.720 --> 00:23.320
Are you reading anything?

00:25.680 --> 00:27.680
Nuthin'! Lifesigns from the planet are negative.

00:27.720 --> 00:29.040
Then it is a shame.

00:29.080 --> 00:32.759
From what we read in the Atlantis database,
the Durandens were a wonderful race of people.

00:32.800 --> 00:37.480
Well the database is over 10,000 years old.
You can bet things have changed around here.

00:38.280 --> 00:39.280
Sheppard...

00:47.000 --> 00:48.120
OK.

00:48.760 --> 00:50.840
That's not something you see everyday.

00:51.640 --> 00:53.640
There was a great battle here.

00:56.840 --> 00:58.640
<i>That is a hive ship.</i>

01:00.320 --> 01:01.960
Well, it was a hive ship.

01:02.000 --> 01:04.599
Something put a lot of holes in it, alright.

01:05.200 --> 01:06.600
We should check it out.

01:06.640 --> 01:08.960
What if whatever put holes in it
wants to put holes in us?

01:09.000 --> 01:12.200
You just said a lot's changed in 10,000 years.

01:27.800 --> 01:30.360
That would explain the lack of lifesigns.

01:31.040 --> 01:33.480
This is what usually happens when you fight back.

01:33.600 --> 01:38.720
These folks took out a fleet of Wraith ships.
I'd say they did a pretty good job of fighting back.

01:38.760 --> 01:39.840
Hold on!

01:39.841 --> 01:43.121
We're picking up faint energy readings....from...

01:45.520 --> 01:46.720
there.

01:51.720 --> 01:53.400
That would explain how they were
able to put up such a good fight.

01:53.440 --> 01:54.720
How?

01:54.760 --> 01:55.960
Because,

01:56.440 --> 01:58.040
they were Ancients.

03:19.540 --> 03:21.220
Definitely Ancient design.

03:21.260 --> 03:22.900
Their latest stuff, too.

03:23.500 --> 03:25.780
Their latest being 10,000 years old.

03:25.820 --> 03:28.300
It's a lot like the labs we found on Atlantis.

03:28.580 --> 03:30.420
So this is one of their outposts?

03:30.500 --> 03:34.500
Yet the Ancestors made no mention
of their presence here, in the database.

03:34.501 --> 03:35.501
Why?

03:35.580 --> 03:38.940
- Well, let's find out. Can you power it up?
- Working on it.

03:57.380 --> 03:59.380
<i>I got two bodies here.</i>

04:03.660 --> 04:05.460
<i>I got three more over here.</i>

04:05.700 --> 04:09.300
<i>Whatever happened here,
no-one came back to claim the dead.</i>

04:14.460 --> 04:16.660
I can't tell if they were fed on by the Wraith.

04:16.700 --> 04:18.459
Yeah, something killed them.

04:18.500 --> 04:20.500
Something killed everyone on this world.

04:20.540 --> 04:24.220
Why is this outpost,
if that's what it is, still intact?

04:24.260 --> 04:26.580
It doesn't make sense. What do you think Rodney?

04:28.380 --> 04:31.380
Sorry, I... wasn't listening,
but it just struck me that

04:31.420 --> 04:33.060
if this is an Ancient outpost,

04:33.180 --> 04:35.020
why would the Wraith leave it intact?

04:37.140 --> 04:38.980
That's a good question.

04:42.580 --> 04:43.660
Alright, let's see...

04:43.700 --> 04:44.860
So...

04:49.060 --> 04:50.860
<i>So it's a military research facility?</i>

04:50.900 --> 04:54.820
From what we can tell, it's a ground based version of
the satellite weapon we used to destroy that hive ship.

04:54.860 --> 04:57.420
With one major exception. Fire power.

04:57.460 --> 05:00.460
I mean, if that single outpost was responsible
for destroying an entire Wraith fleet...

05:00.500 --> 05:03.220
And you're sure it was this weapon
that destroyed all those Wraith ships?

05:03.260 --> 05:08.620
It had to be. There's nothing on
the planet that suggests the Durandens had anything
capable of inflicting anywhere near that much damage.

05:08.660 --> 05:11.860
If we could learn of such technology,
we could defend other worlds from being culled.

05:11.900 --> 05:13.220
It didn't save the Durandens.

05:13.260 --> 05:15.980
Yeah, but at the end of the day,
the outpost was still standing and that means...

05:16.020 --> 05:18.940
well I'm not sure what that means.
But it means something definitely worth finding out.

05:18.980 --> 05:20.780
- Colonel?
- He's right.

05:20.820 --> 05:22.660
It's definitely worth sending a research team back.

05:22.700 --> 05:26.380
Good! Well give me Optican, Collins and Zelenka,
if he's over the stomach flu.

05:26.420 --> 05:28.980
We'll try to access the computers log books.
See if we can decipher them and if that's...

05:29.020 --> 05:30.420
OK, OK.

05:30.460 --> 05:31.620
Easy sell.

05:31.660 --> 05:33.460
- Go!
- Oh good.

05:38.340 --> 05:39.740
Teyla...

05:39.780 --> 05:42.140
I heard you were heading offworld
on a personal mission.

05:42.300 --> 05:44.900
- To Balkan, yes.
- Sounds interesting.

05:47.060 --> 05:53.620
The Balkans possess a particular
disease resistant strain of flax seed, which
would double the yield of our crops on the mainland.

05:53.660 --> 05:59.020
In exchange, I intend to offer
Athosian manpower to aid in their harvest.

06:00.020 --> 06:01.420
Still interested?

06:01.860 --> 06:05.380
This place has everything I want,
don't get me wrong, but...

06:05.420 --> 06:08.060
Sometimes you feel the need to go somewhere else.

06:08.100 --> 06:10.700
- Anywhere else.
- I know the feeling.

06:10.900 --> 06:11.860
So?

06:12.860 --> 06:15.020
Bring only weapons you can conceal.

06:16.620 --> 06:18.620
I'll keep it to a bare minimum.

06:33.980 --> 06:36.540
<i>I'm telling you, at least .09%.</i>

06:36.580 --> 06:39.780
Oh please, please, move the decimal place.
I mean, it's, it's, it's impossible for God's sake.

06:39.820 --> 06:41.340
Have you figured out what this is?

06:41.380 --> 06:44.220
- No.
- No, I wouldn't say no. No, we have a theory.
- Well, we don't know yet.

06:44.260 --> 06:46.860
No, but based on the shielding around
the chamber, what else could it be?

06:46.900 --> 06:48.700
Have you tried turning it on?

06:48.740 --> 06:51.660
That's what we're working on.
The problem is that there's no direct link between it

06:51.700 --> 06:57.500
and the main power control systems,
which among other things has led us to theorize that
it's an instrument to power up the weapons systems.

06:57.540 --> 06:59.500
- Cool!
- See that? You see?

06:59.540 --> 07:03.140
See the way he lights up at the mention of that?
It's like Doctor Vogel at the mention of pastries.

07:03.180 --> 07:07.020
- They found out a way to soup up their space gun.
- Yes, but it's much more than that.

07:07.060 --> 07:09.220
Well, the sticking point is that there's...

07:09.260 --> 07:11.860
no tie between
the power generator and the primary capacitor.

07:11.900 --> 07:14.860
Yes. Meaning they would have to channel
the power directly into the weapon.

07:14.900 --> 07:17.540
Which I'm sure means nothing to you.

07:17.580 --> 07:22.580
Means they could fire multiple bursts without having
to store up more power for the next firing sequence.

07:24.260 --> 07:25.100
Yes.

07:25.140 --> 07:27.380
- Very good!
- Which leads me back

07:27.420 --> 07:28.660
to, cool.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.660
Yes, but it only makes sense if we're right.

07:30.700 --> 07:31.900
About what?

07:33.380 --> 07:34.340
Tell him.

07:34.540 --> 07:35.460
Not yet.

07:35.660 --> 07:38.780
Come on McKay, you read the equations.
What else could it be? An Ancient typo?

07:38.820 --> 07:41.900
Well we know they're not perfect,
because they're all dead!

07:41.940 --> 07:44.540
Look, I just, I just,
I don't want you to get all excited over nothing.

07:44.580 --> 07:46.740
- Well, maybe you're right.
- I'll give you a hint.

07:46.780 --> 07:51.180
It seems the Ancients were experimenting with high
energy physics on a level that we've never seen before.

07:54.860 --> 07:58.140
- Wow.
- Yes, wow. I just, I want to be sure.

08:01.780 --> 08:03.580
I'll do my best to wait.

08:07.780 --> 08:11.300
The manpower that you are demanding is outrageous.

08:11.500 --> 08:17.100
You would turn my people into nothing more
than indentured slaves, to serve your farms.

08:17.580 --> 08:21.580
It would seem that you have nothing else
of value to trade, but your people.

08:24.420 --> 08:25.660
Mattus.

08:26.580 --> 08:29.300
<i>You know full well my offer is fair.</i>

08:29.620 --> 08:30.940
I'm sorry Teyla.

08:30.980 --> 08:33.020
If you had something of more value to offer,

08:33.059 --> 08:35.020
<i>Technology,
weapons.</i>

08:35.059 --> 08:37.059
You've heard my terms.

08:39.220 --> 08:40.140
Then,

08:40.179 --> 08:42.179
our business is done here.

08:43.900 --> 08:46.220
She said her offer is fair.

08:49.460 --> 08:51.220
I say it isn't.

08:53.220 --> 08:54.260
Well,

08:54.380 --> 08:55.780
I say it is.

09:11.900 --> 09:12.700
What?

09:14.900 --> 09:17.380
I had the situation under control!

09:17.420 --> 09:20.620
- It didn't look like it.
- So you came to my rescue.

09:21.340 --> 09:25.700
You have no idea what is at stake
during these negotiations! My people depend on me!

09:25.740 --> 09:27.420
They were taking advantage of you.

09:27.460 --> 09:28.820
No they were not!

09:28.900 --> 09:30.700
That is what I wanted them to think.

09:30.740 --> 09:35.260
A negotiation is a delicate process.
The words spoken are often meaningless.

09:36.820 --> 09:37.820
Teyla!

09:41.420 --> 09:42.700
- Do you want me to...
- No!

09:43.500 --> 09:46.460
Go! Gather our things, I will meet you at the Gate.

09:51.380 --> 09:54.860
It was a mistake to force Hendon's hand.
You will only pay for it next time.

09:54.900 --> 09:56.020
I know.

09:56.940 --> 09:59.260
- Your friend is not Athosian?
- No.

09:59.620 --> 10:02.820
Ronon is the only survivor
of a world known as Sateda.

10:02.860 --> 10:06.660
He saved the life of a friend of mine
and in return we offered him sanctuary.

10:06.700 --> 10:10.100
If Sateda is his homeworld,
then he is not the only survivor.

10:10.820 --> 10:14.420
<i>There is a man in this village
who also claims to be from there.</i>

10:21.300 --> 10:22.900
What have we got Sergeant?

10:23.020 --> 10:24.620
It's Colonel Sheppard, Ma'am.

10:24.660 --> 10:26.620
This is Weir. Go ahead Colonel.

10:27.740 --> 10:30.220
<i>We're on our way back. Rodney wants to fill you in.</i>

10:31.020 --> 10:33.020
I take it you found something interesting.

10:33.060 --> 10:34.140
Interesting?

10:34.180 --> 10:38.300
- How about the greatest discovery of all time!
- He's pretty excited.

10:38.900 --> 10:41.580
So I hear. He couldn't even wait till he got back.

10:41.620 --> 10:46.980
I wanted to send an encoded databurst directly
from the outpost to the secure network in my lab,
while the Gate was active.

10:48.540 --> 10:49.380
Now!

10:49.980 --> 10:51.460
<i>Receiving transmission.</i>

10:52.580 --> 10:54.100
Transferring data.

10:58.700 --> 11:01.460
Care to fill me in, so I can be excited too?

11:01.500 --> 11:04.380
- It's a weapon.
- It is much, much more than a weapon!

11:04.420 --> 11:07.460
We think we've stumbled across
the Ancients' last great discovery.

11:07.500 --> 11:10.180
<i>It was too late to win the war for them, but
I think if I can finish the work they started, then...</i>

11:10.190 --> 11:11.470
What is it?

11:11.500 --> 11:13.580
It's the ultimate power source.

11:13.740 --> 11:18.140
Something that would make Zero Point Modules
seem like alkaline batteries in comparison.

11:27.600 --> 11:29.080
<i>It was called Project Arcturus</i>

11:29.120 --> 11:33.920
and from what we could tell,
it's ultimate goal was to render ZPM's obsolete.

11:34.200 --> 11:35.200
How?

11:37.240 --> 11:43.040
The Zero Point Module
is an artificially created region of subspace time.
It's kind of like a miniature universe in a bottle.

11:43.080 --> 11:47.920
It extracts vacuum energy through it's artificial region
of subspace time until it reaches maximum entropy.

11:47.960 --> 11:49.560
So what's different about this thing?

11:49.600 --> 11:52.360
Project Arcturus was attempting to extract vacuum energy

11:52.400 --> 11:54.880
from our own space time. Making it

11:54.920 --> 11:57.960
potentially as powerful
as the scope of the universe itself.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.680
It strikes me as something
the Ancients would have tried first, even before ZPM's.

12:01.720 --> 12:06.920
And they may have. But extracting zero point energy
from our own universe is, well it's definitely trickier.

12:07.240 --> 12:08.080
Explain trickier.

12:08.120 --> 12:12.680
Well, because we actually have to live in our
own universe, it presents a whole range of problems.

12:12.720 --> 12:16.240
Well obviously it's not all
that easy or Atlantis wouldn't still be relying on ZPM's.

12:16.280 --> 12:19.360
Well, you're right. The Ancients couldn't make it work.

12:19.400 --> 12:20.720
I said I wanted to do all the talking.

12:20.760 --> 12:24.720
- Come on Rodney, Arcturus was a total failure.
- Failure, yes. Total, no.

12:24.760 --> 12:28.320
<i>Look, the Ancients were losing
the war against the Wraith, when work on Arcturus began.</i>

12:28.360 --> 12:29.800
<i>If they could have made it work,</i>

12:29.840 --> 12:32.960
it could have turned the tide of war. I mean,
we're talking about their own Manhatten Project here.

12:33.000 --> 12:38.800
The outpost was ordered by the Ancients in Atlantis,
to defend the Duranden people using their
weapons powered by this new power source.

12:38.840 --> 12:43.920
Yeah, yes,
but despite their strong reservations that it
was not ready to be tested under battle conditions.

12:43.960 --> 12:45.360
The point is, the Wraith won.

12:45.400 --> 12:49.040
Yes but the Durandens still inflicted
massive damage on the attacking Wraith fleet.

12:49.080 --> 12:50.540
- I'm not saying they didn't put up a hell of a fight.

12:50.541 --> 12:53.841
The logs indicate there was a major malfunction.

12:53.880 --> 12:57.080
Well yes, the Ancients in the bunker were forced
to shut everything down, including the weapon.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.600
The Wraith sent more ships, the Durandens got wiped out.

12:59.640 --> 13:03.240
So if the malfunction hadn't occurred,
the Ancients would have saved the planet?

13:03.280 --> 13:04.160
Definitely!

13:04.200 --> 13:06.600
Possibly. Don't sugar coat this, Rodney.

13:06.640 --> 13:12.920
The Ancient scientists running Arcturus
were rushed into testing before they had perfected
a means of effectively controlling the power output.

13:12.960 --> 13:14.560
<i>I believe, if they'd had more time,</i>

13:14.600 --> 13:16.480
history would have played out
differently on that planet.

13:16.520 --> 13:18.200
Possibly in this galaxy.

13:18.400 --> 13:21.840
I won't deny that this is something
that we'd dearly love to get our hands on,

13:21.880 --> 13:24.160
but the Ancients were a pretty bright bunch.

13:24.200 --> 13:27.600
And desperate and losing a war they'd
already been fighting for a hundred years.

13:27.640 --> 13:30.440
More importantly, they were, they were like this close.

13:32.720 --> 13:34.800
And you believe you can finish their work?

13:34.840 --> 13:35.960
I do.

13:36.800 --> 13:37.920
We do.

13:38.800 --> 13:39.920
They do.

13:46.400 --> 13:50.400
Alright, I need everyone's attention, please!
What we've got here is...

13:50.440 --> 13:54.160
I need this code divided up into sections
and each one double checked.

13:54.200 --> 13:58.560
- No! No! You're not listening to me. I'm telling you,
this one right here is wrong!
- It's not going to! It's not going to...

13:58.600 --> 14:01.120
The whole point is that these numbers
here should be corrected.

14:01.160 --> 14:04.160
Unless they're corrected...
there you go, simulation failed.

14:14.400 --> 14:15.480
Oh, that's heavy!

14:16.400 --> 14:18.400
So, I need that over there. Thank you.

14:22.680 --> 14:25.800
<i>What I want you to do is pull the crystal.
Pull it when I say go, alright?</i>

14:38.520 --> 14:39.800
I think we have it.

14:47.960 --> 14:49.160
That's it!

15:00.760 --> 15:03.960
We were looking for a man named Solen.
Do you know him?

15:04.320 --> 15:05.320
Upstairs.

15:07.440 --> 15:08.440
Thank you

15:11.880 --> 15:13.000
<i>Was I free?</i>

15:13.320 --> 15:14.560
<i>Course I was.</i>

15:14.920 --> 15:16.840
<i>But my people were counting on me.</i>

15:17.560 --> 15:19.960
Now I was alone. I was low on ammo,

15:20.520 --> 15:24.040
but I managed to take out the three
Wraith guards and gain access to that ship.

15:24.080 --> 15:25.080
<i>Liar!</i>

15:27.000 --> 15:28.400
What did you say?

15:33.200 --> 15:34.200
Ronon?

15:34.240 --> 15:38.040
There were two
Wraith guarding that cruiser and he wasn't alone.

15:42.400 --> 15:46.800
Teyla Emmagan, Solen Senshure.
We served in the same regiment on Sateda.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.160
I am honoured.

15:48.200 --> 15:50.200
You two make a nice match.

15:50.520 --> 15:51.720
<i>Congratulations.</i>

15:52.280 --> 15:53.520
We are friends.

15:53.560 --> 15:54.760
Nothing more.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.560
For years I believed I was the only survivor.

15:58.560 --> 16:00.400
So you don't know about the others?

16:00.440 --> 16:01.720
What others?

16:02.200 --> 16:07.000
Before the city fell, a few of us managed
to make it to the shelters west of the capital.

16:07.200 --> 16:10.600
<i>Over 300 civilians found their way there too.</i>

16:11.440 --> 16:14.440
When we emerged
we realised there was nothing to salvage, so

16:14.720 --> 16:15.880
<i>we left.</i>

16:16.000 --> 16:17.160
<i>All of us.</i>

16:18.600 --> 16:19.680
To where?

16:19.800 --> 16:22.400
Some came here. Some went to Manaria.

16:23.920 --> 16:25.120
300.

16:26.600 --> 16:29.400
Drink Ronon and rejoice. You're not alone!

16:36.000 --> 16:37.800
Everything's been triple checked.

16:37.840 --> 16:41.040
Power levels
are holding steady in all computer simulations.

16:41.080 --> 16:42.840
- Power it up.
- Alright!

16:42.880 --> 16:44.480
Attention all personnel!

16:44.600 --> 16:47.800
Stand by for power up, on my mark!

16:47.840 --> 16:48.840
<i>3...</i>

16:49.320 --> 16:50.320
<i>2...</i>

16:50.800 --> 16:51.800
<i>1...</i>

16:52.360 --> 16:53.240
mark.

17:10.599 --> 17:13.800
Oh man. To see Kel's face when he sees you.

17:15.680 --> 17:17.200
Yeah, it's true.

17:18.599 --> 17:19.720
Kel's alive.

17:20.440 --> 17:21.760
And his family.

17:21.800 --> 17:23.480
They settled on Belsa.

17:24.000 --> 17:26.800
Run this big trading operation over there.

17:27.280 --> 17:29.120
When were you going to tell me this?

17:29.280 --> 17:32.160
Honestly,
I was going to wait until you drank a little more.

17:34.080 --> 17:35.600
Then you've seen him.

17:35.800 --> 17:39.800
Yeah, he comes around now and then
to trade weapons with the Balkans.

17:40.080 --> 17:42.400
He's got his own private army now.

17:43.800 --> 17:45.800
Is this Kel, a friend?

17:47.200 --> 17:49.280
Oh, he's more like kin.

17:49.520 --> 17:51.560
He was Ronon's taskmaster

17:51.600 --> 17:53.840
during his military training.

17:54.280 --> 17:56.600
There is no closer bond.

17:58.400 --> 17:59.400
None.

18:00.800 --> 18:02.160
To reunions.

18:04.680 --> 18:05.880
To reunions.

18:12.480 --> 18:13.880
Radek, talk to me.

18:14.400 --> 18:16.800
<i>I'm picking up some minor power fluctuations.</i>

18:17.320 --> 18:19.320
Chamber's temperature's holding steady.

18:21.480 --> 18:22.680
<i>There it goes again.</i>

18:23.600 --> 18:24.640
Is everything OK?

18:24.680 --> 18:25.400
<i>Everything's fine.</i>

18:25.440 --> 18:30.400
The containment bubble is designed to automatically
compensate for any sudden changes in energy output.

18:30.440 --> 18:32.400
This never happened in the simulations.

18:32.600 --> 18:33.800
Maybe we should abort.

18:33.840 --> 18:38.400
I said it's fine. Collins. See if you can
boost more power to the field, manually.

18:38.440 --> 18:39.560
You got it.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.920
Prepare for test firing.

18:58.960 --> 19:00.160
On my mark.

19:06.560 --> 19:08.160
Levels just spiked into the red!

19:09.800 --> 19:10.600
What?

19:10.640 --> 19:11.920
Shut it down. Shut it all down!

19:11.960 --> 19:12.800
I'm trying.

19:13.160 --> 19:14.960
The interface is not responding.

19:16.600 --> 19:18.440
I'm gonna switch to back-ups!

19:19.800 --> 19:21.800
- Levels are going off the scale!
- McKay?

19:21.920 --> 19:24.800
I have given the command to shut down.
Something's creating an overload.

19:24.840 --> 19:25.560
We should evacuate.

19:25.600 --> 19:26.560
Just give me a few seconds!

19:26.600 --> 19:28.000
We may not have that time!

19:29.200 --> 19:30.160
Wait, wait, wait.

19:30.800 --> 19:32.000
It's stabilizing.

19:36.200 --> 19:37.400
Generator is offline.

19:41.800 --> 19:42.960
What the hell just happened?

19:43.000 --> 19:47.400
Obviously there was a surge of some kind.
Look. Collins....Collins.

19:51.000 --> 19:51.800
<i>Collins!</i>

20:08.150 --> 20:11.830
Officially my report will indicate
Dr Collins died due to radiation exposure,

20:11.870 --> 20:14.470
causing severe burns to well over 90% of his body.

20:15.550 --> 20:16.750
But it was more than that?

20:16.790 --> 20:17.870
Aye, much more.

20:18.470 --> 20:21.270
<i>To be honest, I have no idea
what sort of radiation it was.</i>

20:21.310 --> 20:24.150
I've never seen or heard of
cellular decay this massive.

20:24.190 --> 20:26.390
Not when exposure only lasted mere seconds.

20:27.110 --> 20:29.550
Collins' next of kin have been notified.

20:30.550 --> 20:31.550
Good.

20:33.750 --> 20:34.750
What went wrong?

20:35.830 --> 20:37.950
We're still analyzing data from the test.

20:38.550 --> 20:43.510
All we know for certain was, there was a massive power
surge which in turn, caused the containment field

20:43.550 --> 20:47.550
to expand asymmetrically in the direction
of the command access tube.

20:47.950 --> 20:49.150
As to why...

20:49.190 --> 20:50.550
How about human error?

20:52.350 --> 20:53.270
Excuse me?

20:53.310 --> 20:57.550
Well, according to your report, during the test,
Dr Collins made an adjustment to the containment field.

20:57.590 --> 21:00.870
Isn't it possible that he triggered the surge himself?

21:02.550 --> 21:04.750
Are you looking for a scapegoat, Colonel?

21:04.950 --> 21:05.910
<i>Not at all Doctor.</i>

21:05.950 --> 21:10.350
I'm admittedly looking for a rationale that would
allow Dr McKay to continue his very important work.

21:10.390 --> 21:11.990
Is there something wrong with that?

21:12.750 --> 21:16.070
No! Collins knew the systems just as well as any of us.

21:16.110 --> 21:17.630
He wouldn't have made that kind of mistake.

21:17.670 --> 21:20.350
<i>Everything was going well.
Everyone did their job.</i>

21:21.750 --> 21:22.750
Then what?

21:22.950 --> 21:23.950
I don't know!

21:24.950 --> 21:26.630
In terms of physics, it shouldn't have happened.

21:26.950 --> 21:30.230
We're still analyzing the data from the accident.
It's going to take time...

21:30.270 --> 21:33.750
What I do know, is the device did
what it was supposed to do.

21:34.150 --> 21:35.830
No Rodney, it didn't.

21:35.870 --> 21:38.350
Well, apart from the obvious containment issues.

21:38.390 --> 21:40.750
It overloaded and you couldn't stop it.

21:40.790 --> 21:44.190
But we won't know for sure until
we go back down there and try again.

21:44.230 --> 21:46.430
Try again? Are you serious?

21:46.470 --> 21:47.190
Yes.

21:52.150 --> 21:54.190
A member of your team is in the morgue.

21:54.230 --> 21:58.070
And I am responsible for his death, yes.
I am painfully aware of that.

21:58.110 --> 22:01.150
I sent him in there and I will have to live
with that for the rest of my life.

22:01.190 --> 22:05.350
But we have a responsibility
to understand what happened and learn from it.

22:06.550 --> 22:08.350
Rodney, we don't even know what went wrong.

22:08.390 --> 22:10.190
Which is why we have to go back there!

22:14.150 --> 22:16.950
I know how important this is to you, Rodney.

22:17.150 --> 22:22.430
But we knew when we came to Atlantis that we might
encounter certain technologies, which for the moment,

22:22.470 --> 22:23.750
are out of our reach.

22:23.950 --> 22:25.110
It's not in this case.

22:25.150 --> 22:27.310
You have the data from your first attempt.

22:27.950 --> 22:29.950
You can run all the simulations you want.

22:29.990 --> 22:32.870
Come on Elizabeth. You really think
the military's gonna let this go?

22:32.910 --> 22:35.350
<i>I mean, at the very least, we should be
the first ones in there to spearhead the research.</i>

22:35.390 --> 22:36.550
That's what this is about?

22:36.950 --> 22:38.510
You wanna beat them to it?

22:39.350 --> 22:41.550
I'm sorry. The answer's no.

23:02.750 --> 23:03.950
I'm not tired.

23:04.950 --> 23:05.990
Why did we leave?

23:14.350 --> 23:15.950
I believe you've had enough.

23:17.150 --> 23:18.710
I don't believe I have.

23:19.550 --> 23:20.510
Goodnight.

23:22.550 --> 23:23.550
Teyla?

23:27.350 --> 23:29.350
There are 300 of my people.

23:53.750 --> 23:55.430
Harry K. Daghlian.

23:56.350 --> 23:57.150
Who?

23:57.190 --> 23:59.590
He was a scientist.
Worked on the Manhattan Project at Los Alamos.

23:59.630 --> 24:01.350
He was only twenty-six years old.

24:01.390 --> 24:05.050
Accidentally irradiated himself while performing
a critical mass experiment on two

24:05.151 --> 24:07.151
half spheres of plutonium.

24:07.550 --> 24:09.150
It took him a month to die.

24:10.150 --> 24:13.050
While his body was slowly shutting down from
radiation poisoning, you know what he did 

24:13.051 --> 24:15.551
with his last thirty days?

24:15.650 --> 24:16.890
He worked.

24:16.950 --> 24:20.650
He tried until his last breath to understand
what had happened to him, so that others

24:20.651 --> 24:22.651
could learn from the tragedy.

24:22.750 --> 24:27.550
So that his work, his death,
wouldn't be rendered meaningless.

24:29.550 --> 24:33.950
Now, have you considered what would have happened
if they'd just shut that project down after that?

24:33.990 --> 24:34.950
This is different.

24:34.990 --> 24:35.790
Is it?

24:36.550 --> 24:41.570
Collins' death is a pointless waste of life unless
something comes of this and I am not sure that I can...

24:44.550 --> 24:45.870
I think I know what happened.

24:47.950 --> 24:48.950
Let's hear it.

24:48.990 --> 24:50.030
Can I come in?

24:50.350 --> 24:51.150
No.

24:52.550 --> 24:54.550
The Ancients had it wrong.

24:54.590 --> 24:56.670
Our mistake was using their equations.

24:56.710 --> 24:58.150
Look, I just did the calculations again myself.

24:58.190 --> 25:02.950
I did them three times just to be sure
and I am positive the problem is
in the automatic containment protocols.

25:03.350 --> 25:04.550
OK, what's your fix?

25:04.590 --> 25:07.750
I'm proposing that we adjust
the field strength manually.

25:08.150 --> 25:10.150
You saw how fast it spiked on you.

25:10.190 --> 25:12.630
So we don't operate the generator
at anywhere near it's potential.

25:12.670 --> 25:13.950
Look, there's no need to be greedy.

25:13.990 --> 25:16.950
Even operating at 50% it'll still
generate the power of a dozen ZPM's.

25:16.990 --> 25:19.310
How come the Ancient's didn't figure this out?

25:19.350 --> 25:21.070
Maybe they were caught up in the heat of battle.

25:21.110 --> 25:23.750
Maybe they thought that they needed
as much power as they could get.

25:23.790 --> 25:25.550
Maybe they weren't smart enough.

25:25.590 --> 25:26.750
And you are.

25:26.790 --> 25:27.950
No, I didn't say that.

25:28.350 --> 25:30.350
But I have the benefit of hindsight. They didn't.

25:30.550 --> 25:36.750
Look, this is big.
This is the wheel, the light bulb, the hotdog, big.

25:38.550 --> 25:39.950
Best case scenario.

25:39.990 --> 25:41.510
I win a Nobel Prize.

25:41.950 --> 25:43.870
Worse case scenario.

25:43.910 --> 25:45.550
We tear a hole in the fabric of the universe.

25:45.590 --> 25:47.350
Which is much less likely
to happen than the Nobel Prize.

25:47.390 --> 25:51.670
I mean, look, the risks are nothing
compared to the potential benefits.

25:51.710 --> 25:53.950
Elizabeth will listen to you.

25:54.150 --> 25:57.990
I've never asked this of you before,
but I think I've earned it.

25:58.750 --> 25:59.630
Trust me.

26:01.150 --> 26:03.150
I've already made this decision, John!

26:03.190 --> 26:06.590
If Dr McKay says he's solved the problem,
I don't see why we don't give it another shot.

26:06.630 --> 26:09.350
Isn't the Daedalus about ready to head back to Earth?

26:09.750 --> 26:11.510
Yes we are.

26:11.550 --> 26:15.590
But I think you should know the Pentagon
is taking a very keen interest in this vacuum energy.

26:16.350 --> 26:19.030
I'm sure they have, but the Pentagon
doesn't make the decisions here.

26:19.070 --> 26:21.710
<i>Yeah, I may not have the power to overrule you on this.</i>

26:21.750 --> 26:27.550
But when I get back to Earth, I'm going to be
making the recommendation that Dr McKay be allowed
to continue his work, to the highest authorities.

26:28.550 --> 26:29.550
<i>Ultimately Dr Weir,</i>

26:30.750 --> 26:32.310
this won't be up to you.

26:35.950 --> 26:38.990
Can Rodney guarantee that the same thing won't happen?

26:39.150 --> 26:40.550
Nobody can do that.

26:40.750 --> 26:42.150
Then what's changed?

26:42.310 --> 26:45.470
According to him it's the Ancients
calculations that were wrong, not his.

26:45.510 --> 26:47.630
If McKay is that confident,
then I don't see why we don't...

26:47.670 --> 26:50.790
Confidence is not something
Doctor McKay is in any short supply of.

26:50.830 --> 26:53.110
For good reason! If anyone can do this...

26:53.150 --> 26:56.110
The Ancients could not do this.

26:56.270 --> 26:58.310
<i>And that's what it keeps coming back to for me.</i>

26:58.350 --> 27:05.510
Isn't it possible that you have placed the Ancients
on such a high pedestal that you can't even
consider the possibility that they may be wrong?

27:05.550 --> 27:08.390
Why are we mincing words, Colonel?

27:08.870 --> 27:10.190
You want the weapon.

27:10.950 --> 27:13.550
Yes! I do!

27:13.590 --> 27:20.910
A weapon that could effectively eliminate the
Wraith threat is very attractive to me, and to the
people that I work for. I'm not hiding that fact.

27:20.950 --> 27:22.750
But there's more to it, isn't there?

27:22.790 --> 27:24.950
No more hunting for ZPMs.

27:24.990 --> 27:29.230
The shield at full strength.
Faster, more powerful ships.

27:29.270 --> 27:32.750
How about a power source that could provide the
energy needs for an entire planet.

27:32.790 --> 27:33.950
<i>No more fossil fuels.</i>

27:33.990 --> 27:35.750
I get it!

27:35.790 --> 27:40.030
And if it worked as advertised,
it would be wonderful.

27:40.710 --> 27:48.230
I'm trying to tell you, I know Rodney McKay and
there are times when I have to protect him from himself.

27:48.270 --> 27:50.990
I can do that.

27:51.310 --> 27:53.550
<i>Let me go back with him. Just him and me.</i>

27:53.590 --> 27:58.190
You can activate the Stargate any time
you want to contact us by radio.

27:59.590 --> 28:01.710
He really sold you.

28:05.310 --> 28:07.910
He asked me to trust him.

28:16.610 --> 28:19.550
I appreciate your support, Colonel,
but... don't worry.

28:19.590 --> 28:23.010
I try and make it a habit
not to make the same mistake twice.

28:23.650 --> 28:25.150
That was a joke, right?

28:25.190 --> 28:30.390
No. I offer you my personal assurance that a surge
like the one that happened before is inconceivable.

28:31.230 --> 28:33.230
I'm gonna run some power-up simulations first.

28:33.270 --> 28:37.670
How about I carry out my plan and
you keep the hot coffee coming?

28:38.790 --> 28:41.950
Joking again, right?

28:43.310 --> 28:45.390
Well, where were we?

28:47.270 --> 28:49.550
Doctor Weir, I need to speak to you right away.

28:49.590 --> 28:50.470
What is it?

28:50.510 --> 28:53.670
I finished going over the accident data.

28:53.680 --> 28:57.720
I think I know why the Ancients
abandoned this technology.

29:00.590 --> 29:03.030
Colonel Sheppard, this is Atlantis.

29:03.070 --> 29:04.190
<i>Go ahead.</i>

29:04.710 --> 29:06.430
Is Doctor McKay with you?

29:06.470 --> 29:09.990
Of course I am, but we're a little busy
getting ready to run a test here.

29:10.470 --> 29:13.950
Actually, I would like you to delay the test firing.

29:14.350 --> 29:15.150
Why?

29:15.190 --> 29:20.630
We have reason to believe that the weapon's power
source, may not be controllable at any power level.

29:20.790 --> 29:21.870
Radek?

29:21.910 --> 29:22.630
<i>Rodney?</i>

29:22.640 --> 29:28.160
OK, we have been over this. I am doing
this manually, at half power. It's a cakewalk.

29:28.190 --> 29:31.590
I don't think it matters how much cake you walk on.

29:31.630 --> 29:39.150
I've been doing calculations of my own and
I believe that the very act of trying to contain
vacuum energy from our own space-time creates

29:39.190 --> 29:42.590
an environment where
the laws of physics cease to apply.

29:42.630 --> 29:44.070
What are you on about?

29:44.110 --> 29:45.470
<i>As power output increases,</i>

29:45.510 --> 29:52.110
new and exotic particles are continuously created
and destroyed inside the containment chamber,

29:52.150 --> 29:55.430
<i>interacting with each other and with the field itself.</i>

29:55.470 --> 30:00.950
<i>Eventually particles are created
that cannot be prevented in this space-time,</i>

30:00.990 --> 30:04.190
and they breach
the containment field as hard radiation.

30:04.230 --> 30:09.030
As long as I'm monitoring the energy output manually,
I can stop that before it happens.

30:09.070 --> 30:13.870
You cannot predict something
that is inherently unpredictable.

30:13.910 --> 30:16.390
- Rodney?
- I know what I'm doing.

30:16.430 --> 30:22.230
Rodney, I am trying to tell you as a friend,
I have serious doubts.

30:22.270 --> 30:24.150
Well, you're wrong. I'm sorry, but there it is.

30:24.190 --> 30:28.790
And to bring this up now when I am just about to do
this smacks of nothing but professional jealousy.

30:28.830 --> 30:32.070
Fine! Kill yourself,
just like the Ancients did!

30:32.110 --> 30:34.070
What do you mean by that?

30:34.110 --> 30:38.870
I believe if the overload is allowed to continue,
the weapon acts as a sort of release valve

30:38.910 --> 30:41.630
to prevent catastrophic containment failure.

30:41.670 --> 30:45.670
The Ancients barely managed to shut it down,
and they lost their lives in the process.

30:45.710 --> 30:51.670
What we're suggesting is that the Wraith didn't
kill everyone on that planet. It was the weapon itself.

30:51.950 --> 30:54.070
That would explain why this place
is the only thing left standing.

30:54.110 --> 30:57.870
Congratulations, you've solved the mystery
of how the Ancients screwed up ten thousand years ago.

30:57.910 --> 30:59.470
<i>It doesn't mean that I will do the same.</i>

30:59.480 --> 31:01.240
Look, I don't know how else to say this,

31:01.270 --> 31:04.350
but none of you are capable of understanding
this on the same level that I do.

31:04.390 --> 31:06.150
And Zelenka, that includes you.

31:11.270 --> 31:15.710
Rodney, I cannot afford to lose either one of you.

31:16.110 --> 31:20.150
Now tell me. Can you do this?

31:20.190 --> 31:20.910
Yes.

31:21.430 --> 31:23.190
- Are you sure?
- Yes.

31:23.230 --> 31:25.190
- Are you sure you're sure?
- I said yes!

31:25.230 --> 31:27.110
- Because if you're wrong...
- I'm not!

31:36.630 --> 31:39.550
I'll call you back after the test.
How does that sound?

31:39.590 --> 31:41.310
You'd better.

31:42.390 --> 31:44.030
I won't let you down.

31:54.270 --> 31:55.630
How are you feeling?

31:55.640 --> 31:57.120
Fine.

32:00.350 --> 32:04.110
We should really be getting back.
Doctor Weir will be expecting us.

32:04.630 --> 32:05.710
Kel's here.

32:06.390 --> 32:07.430
What?

32:07.470 --> 32:10.710
He's meeting with Hendon right now.
Solen just told me.

32:11.230 --> 32:13.190
I have to see him.

32:13.590 --> 32:17.190
And you would like me to arrange a meeting.

32:17.230 --> 32:21.710
After yesterday, I don't think
I'd get very far if I asked myself.

32:25.630 --> 32:27.710
OK, this is good.

32:27.750 --> 32:30.470
My equations are working like a charm.

32:30.510 --> 32:33.750
Power level's at forty percent,
just to be on the safe side.

32:33.790 --> 32:35.550
I think we're ready for our test.

32:35.590 --> 32:36.790
Where do you want the weapon targeted?

32:36.830 --> 32:38.670
The debris orbiting the planet.

32:38.710 --> 32:39.630
Sounds good.

32:39.670 --> 32:42.990
Bringing the weapon online...
now.

32:57.710 --> 32:58.830
What's that?

32:58.870 --> 33:02.470
Energy surge. It's fine.
I can regulate it.

33:03.510 --> 33:04.470
You said you could contain...

33:04.510 --> 33:09.430
The temperature inside the containment field
is well within acceptable parameters.

33:10.830 --> 33:14.750
Staying ahead of it.
Levels are rising in the chamber.

33:14.790 --> 33:17.950
Reroute power from the secondary systems
to the containment field.

33:17.990 --> 33:19.150
I'm thinking we need to abort.

33:19.160 --> 33:21.840
I can compensate. Just give me a minute.

33:21.870 --> 33:23.950
It's overloading, just like last time.

33:23.990 --> 33:26.150
There is no logical reason this shouldn't be working.

33:26.160 --> 33:26.800
McKay?

33:26.830 --> 33:28.430
None of this should be happening!

33:28.470 --> 33:31.310
Look, the energy levels are spiking at a rate
far greater than anything I predicted.

33:31.350 --> 33:32.870
Shut it down!

33:36.790 --> 33:38.190
Fine.

33:51.750 --> 33:52.950
Doesn't make any sense.

33:54.190 --> 33:55.790
What's wrong?

33:58.550 --> 34:00.230
I can't shut it down.

34:30.550 --> 34:32.469
I am Kel, from Sateda.

34:32.510 --> 34:36.670
Teyla Emmagan of Athos.
Thank you for granting us your time.

34:39.150 --> 34:41.949
If we are to trade,
I would know all the members of your party.

34:41.989 --> 34:45.550
Of course. In fact, that is why we are here.

34:50.070 --> 34:51.150
Ronon!

34:51.190 --> 34:52.909
Hello, Kel.

34:58.830 --> 35:00.990
Ronon, what have you done?

35:02.670 --> 35:06.950
We all know who this man was, what he was.

35:07.590 --> 35:10.950
If anyone here believes he should be avenged,

35:13.430 --> 35:14.990
here I am.

35:41.470 --> 35:43.770
You just used me to murder an innocent man!

35:44.890 --> 35:46.650
He deserved worse.

35:47.130 --> 35:49.850
You said he was like a father to you.

35:50.050 --> 35:52.850
Kel commanded several infantry divisions on Sateda.

35:52.890 --> 35:54.420
When the Wraith came...

35:54.771 --> 35:58.771
he ordered thousands
to their death just to save himself.

35:58.810 --> 36:04.250
He was...
a traitor and a coward.

36:05.130 --> 36:10.130
My only regret
is that his death was quick.

36:17.090 --> 36:19.330
I understand.

36:19.930 --> 36:22.970
In your place I might have done the same.

36:24.770 --> 36:30.250
But believe me when
I tell you that the others would not.

36:30.490 --> 36:34.050
We must not speak of this when we return to Atlantis.

36:36.970 --> 36:41.970
And if you ever use my friendship in such a way again,

36:42.410 --> 36:46.770
I will not be so understanding.

36:58.370 --> 36:59.090
What was that?

36:59.130 --> 37:01.970
The weapon's discharging
to prevent a catastrophic overload.

37:02.010 --> 37:03.810
Alright, that's it. We're outta here.

37:03.850 --> 37:08.970
It's not safe! The weapon's firing
at random targets above the planet.
This is the safest place to be right now.

37:10.090 --> 37:12.290
The place isn't gonna be safe for very much longer!

37:12.330 --> 37:14.890
I can bring it back under control!
Just give me a second!

37:15.490 --> 37:16.290
No you can't!

37:16.330 --> 37:17.690
Just one second!

37:17.700 --> 37:21.380
I've seen this before, Rodney.
Pilots who wouldn't eject when something went wrong.

37:21.410 --> 37:25.610
Trying to fix their planes
right until it hit the ground.

37:26.890 --> 37:28.810
OK, we need to leave.

37:29.210 --> 37:34.930
I've waited too long, the weapon can't discharge
enough power to avoid a catastrophic overload.
This whole planet's gonna go up.

37:36.610 --> 37:38.930
Not that your speech wasn't working.

37:44.490 --> 37:45.770
OK, strap in.

37:45.810 --> 37:48.770
You need to avoid flying predictably
to prevent the weapon from locking onto us.

37:48.810 --> 37:49.730
I know what I'm doing.

37:49.770 --> 37:52.210
I'm just saying,be sure not to fly in a straight line.

37:52.250 --> 37:54.130
Rodney, shut up!

37:59.290 --> 38:02.210
Can I just say there's no way
the Jumper can take even one direct hit?

38:02.250 --> 38:04.290
I'll keep that in mind.

38:14.970 --> 38:16.570
The weapon's locking onto us.

38:16.650 --> 38:19.490
How about I fly us away from the planet,
return after the overload?

38:19.530 --> 38:20.610
We can't.

38:20.810 --> 38:21.290
Why not?

38:21.330 --> 38:27.090
Don't you understand? This explosion is gonna
take out three quarters of the solar system.
There's no way we can fly far enough or fast enough.

38:27.100 --> 38:29.060
We have to head for the Gate.

38:30.010 --> 38:31.370
Dial the Gate.

38:37.170 --> 38:39.130
How do you intend to avoid
getting hit on the final approach?

38:39.170 --> 38:41.890
I haven't figured that part out yet.

38:52.850 --> 38:56.010
<i>It's a good thing we stopped by
to check on your progress, Colonel.</i>

38:56.170 --> 38:58.770
Make a break for the Stargate.
We'll run interference.

38:58.810 --> 39:00.330
<i>Copy that, Daedalus.</i>

39:00.340 --> 39:02.620
Stand by to engage sublight engines on my mark.

39:02.890 --> 39:06.050
Recommend you go into hyperspace
as soon as we go through.

39:06.410 --> 39:08.130
There's gonna be a big bang.

39:08.250 --> 39:09.410
<i>Understood.</i>

39:25.130 --> 39:27.530
Take this grain to the storage room.

39:30.730 --> 39:31.970
<i>You are the smartest guy we have.</i>

39:32.010 --> 39:32.770
<i>I know!</i>

39:35.170 --> 39:40.810
<i>putting your life and other people's lives at risk.
You destroyed three quarters of a solar system!</i>

39:40.850 --> 39:42.290
<i>Well, five sixths. It's not an exact science.</i>

39:42.330 --> 39:45.850
<i>Rodney, can you give
your ego a rest for one second?</i>

39:47.690 --> 39:49.450
Oh, Colonel!

39:49.850 --> 39:51.010
Colonel!

39:52.290 --> 39:53.890
I've been looking all over for you.

39:53.900 --> 39:55.340
I heard.

39:58.450 --> 39:59.970
I suppose I deserve that.

40:00.370 --> 40:01.730
Look, I just...

40:02.330 --> 40:05.850
I wanted to apologise about what happened.
I was wrong. I'm sorry.

40:06.010 --> 40:09.690
And I wanted to assure you that,
I intend not being right again,

40:09.700 --> 40:12.660
about everything, effective immediately.

40:16.210 --> 40:17.490
That was a joke.

40:17.530 --> 40:18.850
Good one.

40:20.330 --> 40:22.330
I've already apologised to Elizabeth

40:22.810 --> 40:24.730
and Radek and

40:25.010 --> 40:29.090
I thanked Colonel Caldwell for...
caring enough to spy on the experiment from orbit.

40:29.130 --> 40:31.210
I sent him a nice little email, actually.

40:31.330 --> 40:34.050
But I saved you till last because,

40:34.130 --> 40:38.310
honestly, I would... I would hate
to think that recent events might have
permanently

40:38.331 --> 40:41.331
dimmed your faith in my abilities,

40:41.370 --> 40:42.690
or your trust.

40:43.330 --> 40:47.530
At the very least, I hope I can earn that back.

40:48.130 --> 40:50.370
That may take a while.

40:51.850 --> 40:53.090
I see.

40:53.650 --> 40:59.570
But, I'm sure you can do it,
if you really wanna try.
