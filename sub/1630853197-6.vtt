WEBVTT

00:10.010 --> 00:13.096
Follow yourselfTo the top of a mountain

00:13.180 --> 00:15.682
Answer the callYeah, be the believer

00:15.766 --> 00:18.852
Throw your fears like a wishInto a fountain

00:19.436 --> 00:22.898
Like a warrior

00:22.981 --> 00:25.192
Whatever you might beWhoever you are

00:25.275 --> 00:28.695
You're a warrior

00:31.323 --> 00:33.408
"In plain sight."

00:36.245 --> 00:39.706
Do you know what we're doing today?Gladys wouldn't give us any hints.

00:40.457 --> 00:43.919
Greymoon didn't either.But at least we get to work together.

00:44.628 --> 00:45.963
I know, right?

00:46.046 --> 00:48.465
Remember when we got paired upfor that scavenger hunt?

00:48.549 --> 00:51.510
And we crashed that gnome family reunion?

00:52.052 --> 00:55.264
It took weeks to get that potato saladout of my hair.

00:57.975 --> 01:00.102
Getting to work with you is the best. Getting to work with you is the best.

01:00.185 --> 01:01.395
And then we can…

01:01.478 --> 01:03.355
Go to the hidden waterfall!

01:05.440 --> 01:07.901
Hello, classes.

01:07.985 --> 01:13.115
Now, as Wiz Kids and Lil Rumblers,you are developing unique skills.

01:13.198 --> 01:17.995
Wiz Kids learn to follow directionsdown to the most minute detail.

01:18.078 --> 01:22.583
And as warriors, Lil Rumblers learnto protect all living things.

01:22.666 --> 01:25.752
Which means defending and nurturing them.

01:25.836 --> 01:29.423
Which is why todaywe are working together

01:29.506 --> 01:32.926
-to take care of plants!-Take care of plants.

01:35.262 --> 01:39.099
And here to help is a special guest.

01:39.183 --> 01:44.980
They are talented. They are glorious.Their warmth outshines the sun.

01:45.063 --> 01:47.357
Gladys, the plants are getting antsy.

01:47.441 --> 01:51.987
Right, right.Please welcome my partner, Wren.

01:52.070 --> 01:55.616
Hey, chickadees.I brought some magical plants for ya.

01:55.699 --> 01:58.160
Each one has its own personality.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.663
So pay close attentionto the care instructions I give you. So pay close attentionto the care instructions I give you.

02:01.747 --> 02:04.917
By the end of the day,if your plant is well cared for,

02:05.000 --> 02:07.294
you shall earn your plant care token.

02:07.961 --> 02:09.213
Wow!

02:09.963 --> 02:12.674
Now, I will be splitting youinto groups of two.

02:12.758 --> 02:16.178
One Lil Rumbler and one Wiz Kidto each plant.

02:16.261 --> 02:18.096
Celestia and Rhino.

02:18.680 --> 02:19.973
Beetle and Oatcake.

02:21.433 --> 02:24.353
So, which plant do you thinkwe'll get, Hawthy?

02:24.436 --> 02:26.271
Hawthorn and Annabelle.

02:26.355 --> 02:27.898
Wait. What?

02:27.981 --> 02:31.485
And finally, Pinecone and Fauna.

02:32.486 --> 02:35.489
-Fauna?-I think you'll really like Fauna.

02:35.572 --> 02:38.325
She's nice and smart.

02:38.408 --> 02:40.494
And really connected with nature.

02:41.745 --> 02:43.372
Really connected.

02:43.455 --> 02:47.334
Oh, Hawthorn! Our dream team awaits.

02:47.417 --> 02:50.045
Don't worry. We'll still hang after class.

02:50.128 --> 02:52.589
-Hidden waterfall, right?-Right.

02:52.673 --> 02:56.468
It's okay, pal. Me and Hawthare still good buds.

02:56.552 --> 02:59.096
I'll just have to make a new bud today.

03:04.184 --> 03:07.980
Hiya, partner. How's it going?I'm Pinecone.

03:12.734 --> 03:16.154
That means, "Hello, I'm Fauna"in wood hen.

03:16.238 --> 03:18.490
How do you say your name in wood hen?

03:23.328 --> 03:27.416
Beep, bop, beep, boop, boop. Chirp.

03:28.876 --> 03:32.171
May I present the timber wolf puppy.

03:32.796 --> 03:33.839
Okay.

03:36.633 --> 03:38.760
Maybe we'll get a cool plant too.

03:38.844 --> 03:42.055
Like a dragonflytrap,or a wood-manticore, or--

03:42.139 --> 03:44.308
A snake root.

03:49.521 --> 03:51.773
And here are your instructions.

03:54.985 --> 03:56.820
Look how happy it is.

03:56.904 --> 03:58.322
-Yeah…-Come on.

03:58.405 --> 03:59.656
…really happy.

04:00.574 --> 04:06.413
It is our task to provide sunlight, trim,water, and feed our friend.

04:06.997 --> 04:09.041
Snake roots need a lot of care.

04:09.917 --> 04:13.045
Why? It just lies there.

04:13.128 --> 04:16.048
Well, they might not"rock the castle down," but they're--

04:16.130 --> 04:19.009
Hey, that's a linefrom a Smash Punks song.

04:19.091 --> 04:20.761
I love the Smash Punks.

04:20.844 --> 04:26.016
I as well. You should see medance to them when the moon is high.

04:26.099 --> 04:30.771
Did you know "Leaf It Alone"is actually about snake roots?

04:30.854 --> 04:35.108
Snake roots are quite interesting.They grow in pairs of two.

04:35.192 --> 04:38.195
-They do especially well in…-Nice throw, Hawthy!

04:38.278 --> 04:40.239
…sunny conditions. So we should--

04:40.322 --> 04:43.450
Pinecone? Pinecone?

04:43.534 --> 04:47.788
I was just saying we should take Snakeyhere somewhere with better sunlight.

04:47.871 --> 04:50.207
We all thrive in better sunlight.

04:52.042 --> 04:53.794
I know the perfect spot. Come on!

04:54.461 --> 04:56.797
So, where are we going?What are we talking about?

04:56.880 --> 04:59.049
Just start from the topand spare no details.

04:59.132 --> 05:01.969
Our instructions said to take Cupcakefor a walk. Our instructions said to take Cupcakefor a walk.

05:02.052 --> 05:06.265
Cupcake? What kind of nameis that for a timber wolf?

05:09.852 --> 05:11.812
It's kind of an inside joke.

05:12.479 --> 05:14.606
Pinecone, why are we in the forest?

05:14.690 --> 05:16.316
It's too shady in here.

05:18.235 --> 05:22.739
Good one, Fauna.One of our classic inside jokes.

05:22.823 --> 05:25.075
Snake roots, shade.

05:28.203 --> 05:32.082
Well, the forest was an interesting idea.

05:32.165 --> 05:36.336
But our instructions said we must keepSnakey in the sun's embrace.

05:37.212 --> 05:40.048
Next we have to trim the snake root.

05:40.132 --> 05:43.218
Why don't you hold it still while I cut?

05:43.802 --> 05:46.722
That should be easy. It barely moves.

05:46.805 --> 05:50.517
Snake roots are my favorite plant.What's your favorite?

05:52.603 --> 05:53.604
Trees?

05:54.313 --> 05:56.315
Just a sec. Be right back.

05:59.234 --> 06:02.487
Hey. How was the walk? Boring, right?Very boring? Hey. How was the walk? Boring, right?Very boring?

06:02.571 --> 06:06.491
It was fun actually.Cupcake loves running in the mud.

06:06.575 --> 06:07.826
And playing in the water.

06:07.910 --> 06:10.913
We're gonna take itto this waterfall Hawthorn mentioned.

06:10.996 --> 06:13.123
Our hidden waterfall?

06:13.207 --> 06:18.754
Well, yeah. But there's no reasonit has to stay hidden, right?

06:19.796 --> 06:23.592
So, how are things with Fauna?

06:23.675 --> 06:27.596
Great. We've made so many memories.Snake roots are such cool plants.

06:27.679 --> 06:29.181
-Easily one of the…-Pinecone.

06:29.264 --> 06:31.433
-…top ten plants out there.-Can you help, please?

06:37.147 --> 06:39.149
Look at that great haircut.

06:40.943 --> 06:42.444
Thanks for doing that, Fauna.

06:42.528 --> 06:45.822
I just had to check on somethingwith Hawth and Annabelle.

06:46.657 --> 06:51.537
It's fine. Let's just move onto something else. Like food and water.

06:51.620 --> 06:56.583
I'll go get the food from Wren'ssupply cart while you water Snakey.

06:56.667 --> 07:02.089
Remember, snake roots aren't very thirsty.A sprinkle should be fine. Remember, snake roots aren't very thirsty.A sprinkle should be fine.

07:02.172 --> 07:05.175
No problemo. I got this.

07:07.678 --> 07:09.680
Hey, look.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.224
It likes it.

07:12.307 --> 07:15.394
Hey, Hawth. Come check out my plant.

07:16.478 --> 07:19.314
Hawth! Hey, Hawthy.

07:20.816 --> 07:23.318
Pinecone, that's too much water.

07:23.402 --> 07:25.654
Oops. Sorry, Snakey.

07:25.737 --> 07:28.699
I could make a poulticeto dry out the water.

07:28.782 --> 07:31.159
I just need to gather the ingredients.

07:31.243 --> 07:33.745
In the meantime, food might cheer it up.

07:34.580 --> 07:36.123
I can feed it.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.793
Okay.

07:41.587 --> 07:44.798
Just follow the instructions carefully.

07:45.549 --> 07:47.676
Really carefully.

07:51.180 --> 07:56.018
Okay, Pony. This says our snake root palgets two handfuls of food.

07:56.101 --> 07:57.269
Easy enough.

07:57.352 --> 08:00.147
Wow, great job with the pup. Wow, great job with the pup.

08:00.230 --> 08:01.231
Sit.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.567
Yes! Uh-huh.

08:04.651 --> 08:05.736
Yeah!

08:07.112 --> 08:09.656
That's our special dance.

08:09.740 --> 08:12.242
How could he teach someone elseour dance?

08:13.285 --> 08:16.705
Hawth. Hey, Hawthorn!

08:18.832 --> 08:20.375
What's the deal?

08:20.459 --> 08:24.838
I thought we were BBFFS,best buds forever for sure.

08:24.922 --> 08:27.257
Of course we are. Why wouldn't we be?

08:27.341 --> 08:30.010
I don't know. But it seems likeyou and Annabelle

08:30.093 --> 08:34.932
have become EBBFS,even better best friends suddenly.

08:35.015 --> 08:36.850
I don't know what you're talking about--

08:41.522 --> 08:43.357
Pinecone! Are you okay?

08:44.608 --> 08:45.776
Of course.

08:45.859 --> 08:47.569
Never been better.

08:47.653 --> 08:50.656
Just a little thing Snakey and I do.

08:50.739 --> 08:52.574
Excuse me.

08:52.658 --> 08:55.327
Come on, Snakey. Let go. I'll feed you.

08:55.410 --> 08:58.497
I'll give you water.Okay, maybe no more water.

08:58.580 --> 09:01.875
Yikes. Good thing snake rootsdon't have any teeth. Yikes. Good thing snake rootsdon't have any teeth.

09:01.959 --> 09:03.877
What happened? Where's Fauna?

09:03.961 --> 09:05.546
I'm here.

09:21.228 --> 09:24.815
That was so, so awesome.How'd you do that?

09:24.898 --> 09:29.069
Snake roots are reasonable plantsonce you get to know them.

09:29.152 --> 09:32.489
I wish I tried to get to know them sooner.

09:32.573 --> 09:36.743
Thanks, Fauna. I'm sorry.I wasn't a very good partner today.

09:37.327 --> 09:39.872
I was a little distracted.

09:40.664 --> 09:44.710
You know, snake roots pair upand bond to each other for life.

09:45.502 --> 09:49.464
But they're also very social and bondwith other plants too.

09:50.549 --> 09:51.967
That's really interesting.

09:52.050 --> 09:54.845
Could you tell me more about snake roots?

09:54.928 --> 09:58.182
Or show me that amazingtalking-to-plants trick?

09:58.265 --> 10:02.603
Maybe some other time,when the wind is right. Maybe some other time,when the wind is right.

10:02.686 --> 10:05.063
Hey! Do you think Snakey likes music?

10:05.147 --> 10:07.649
Maybe we could play somethingby the Smash Punks?

10:09.735 --> 10:14.114
Fantastic job with the timber wolf.You should both be proud.

10:14.198 --> 10:16.116
-See ya, Cakie.-Bye, Cupcake.

10:16.200 --> 10:21.330
Next up we have Pinecone, Fauna,and the mighty snake root.

10:22.414 --> 10:24.208
I didn't earn this.

10:24.291 --> 10:26.168
You asked us to work together.

10:26.251 --> 10:31.006
But Fauna was the one who followedthe instructions, nurtured the snake root,

10:31.089 --> 10:33.342
and even helped me.

10:33.425 --> 10:35.052
She deserves the credit.

10:36.053 --> 10:40.224
I'll earn my plant care tokenanother time, in a fair way.

10:40.307 --> 10:43.268
Thank you for your honesty, Pinecone.

10:43.852 --> 10:47.606
Next up, Rhino and Celestiawith their jelly-pod.

10:47.689 --> 10:52.194
That was cool what you said up there.Are you still mad at me?

10:52.277 --> 10:57.032
I'm sorry I told Annabelle about our danceand about the waterfall.

10:57.115 --> 11:00.619
It's okay, Hawth.Annabelle's our friend too. It's okay, Hawth.Annabelle's our friend too.

11:00.702 --> 11:04.665
And it doesn't make us any less BBFNMWs.

11:04.748 --> 11:07.584
You're going to have to spell that oneout for me.

11:07.668 --> 11:09.586
Best buds forever no matter what.

11:14.758 --> 11:19.513
Hey, Fauna. Wanna come with usto a waterfall? It'll be fun.

11:19.596 --> 11:23.809
Sure. It'll give me an opportunityto practice speaking Fish.

11:23.892 --> 11:25.602
I can teach you if you'd like.

11:32.860 --> 11:35.153
"Belt or bust."

11:38.824 --> 11:41.952
I can't believe I finallyget to meet a hippogriff.

11:42.035 --> 11:45.163
Right. Just remember the customwhen we ask for its milk.

11:45.831 --> 11:48.166
Three cartwheels and a curtsy.

11:52.462 --> 11:57.759
Hi, there. I'm heading to Sturdystoneto trade my wares.

11:57.843 --> 12:00.012
Is this the right way? Is this the right way?

12:00.095 --> 12:01.096
You've got it.

12:01.180 --> 12:04.099
The people of Sturdystonelove traveling salespeople.

12:04.183 --> 12:05.767
They'll be excited to meet you.

12:06.351 --> 12:08.395
Not as excited as I am.

12:14.359 --> 12:18.655
Greetings and salutations, Sturdystonians.

12:18.739 --> 12:21.533
The name's Cutie Sugarmuffins.

12:21.617 --> 12:26.205
But you can call meGranny Cutie for short.

12:28.332 --> 12:34.004
I'm here to tell you about my latestand greatest invention,

12:34.087 --> 12:37.382
the Bountiful Belt 3,000.

12:37.466 --> 12:39.051
-I want one.-Look at that.

12:39.134 --> 12:40.469
-Wow.-Marvelous.

12:40.552 --> 12:44.681
This is the ultimate utility belt.

12:44.765 --> 12:48.185
Complete with a built-in wand polisher.

12:48.268 --> 12:52.981
Say goodbye to streaky, smudgy wands

12:53.065 --> 12:58.529
and hello to a wand that shines like new.

12:58.612 --> 12:59.947
Amazing!

13:00.030 --> 13:01.281
-Shiny.-So shiny.

13:01.365 --> 13:05.202
It works on lances and swords too.

13:06.495 --> 13:10.666
It also comeswith a bewitching wish pocket.

13:10.749 --> 13:16.588
You just reach in and pull outwhatever your heart desires.

13:16.672 --> 13:20.217
A new watering can. I love it.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.010
And most impressively,

13:22.094 --> 13:28.559
this little beauty comeswith a never-ending supply of pixie dust.

13:31.270 --> 13:32.729
-Would anyone like one?-Me! Me!

13:32.813 --> 13:34.189
-I would love one.-Over here!

13:34.273 --> 13:36.817
-I must have one.-How much does it cost, Granny?

13:36.900 --> 13:41.405
I only accept newand valuable possessions as a trade.

13:42.614 --> 13:48.912
But since I see so many young and eager

13:48.996 --> 13:52.541
and older faces in the crowd,

13:52.624 --> 13:57.629
I can part with my belts for somethingold and worn.

13:57.713 --> 14:01.175
As long as it has value to you. As long as it has value to you.

14:02.092 --> 14:06.138
I guess I could trade my old wizard's cap.I have a new one.

14:06.221 --> 14:10.851
And I could trade my old watering cansince I have this one now.

14:10.934 --> 14:12.811
I shall call you Howard.

14:12.895 --> 14:14.688
I've got the perfect thing at home.

14:14.771 --> 14:15.814
Me too.

14:18.775 --> 14:23.071
Totally worth the trade.My wand's been needing a good polish.

14:23.780 --> 14:29.036
And this unlimited supply of pixie dustwas totally worth my blankie.

14:29.953 --> 14:34.917
My backup blankie.I'd never give up the original.

14:35.000 --> 14:39.421
Well, I thought I'd never give upmy first abacus, but here we are.

14:40.214 --> 14:42.758
And I traded my all seasons snow globe.

14:42.841 --> 14:48.472
It had snow but also rain, leaves,and sunshine. Very rare.

14:48.555 --> 14:50.349
But it couldn't do this!

14:51.934 --> 14:53.018
Zinnias!

14:53.852 --> 14:56.104
Just what I was wishing for.

14:56.730 --> 14:59.983
Hey, Hawthorn. Guess what we just milked?

15:02.736 --> 15:04.154
What are you guys wearing?

15:04.238 --> 15:06.782
Only the Bountiful Belt 3,000.

15:06.865 --> 15:08.825
What? What does it do?

15:08.909 --> 15:12.704
Well, this… for a start.

15:13.956 --> 15:15.415
Cool.

15:15.958 --> 15:18.794
Would you like to join us for a gameof pixie dust tag?

15:18.877 --> 15:21.713
Oh, yeah! Where do I get a belt?

15:21.797 --> 15:24.424
Granny Cutie's trading for them.

15:25.759 --> 15:27.928
Hello. I'd like one belt, please.

15:28.554 --> 15:30.347
Sorry, two belts.

15:31.348 --> 15:33.600
I'm afraid I'm all sold out.

15:38.814 --> 15:41.441
I guess we'll have to playsomething else, Pony.

15:41.984 --> 15:46.822
I've got no beltI'm all alone

15:47.447 --> 15:52.578
I'm the saddest kid in Sturdystone

15:52.661 --> 15:55.664
Is everything all right in here?

15:55.747 --> 15:59.751
We thought you were being attackedby wolves. Very sick wolves.

15:59.835 --> 16:02.296
I'm expressing my pain through song. I'm expressing my pain through song.

16:02.379 --> 16:06.341
Pony and I didn't geta Bountiful Belt 3,000.

16:06.425 --> 16:07.676
Which is?

16:07.759 --> 16:10.679
Only the coolest new thingeverybody has to have.

16:11.805 --> 16:15.225
Don't let it bum you out, bud.Fads come and go.

16:15.309 --> 16:20.856
This is not a fad.Bountiful Belts are an absolute must.

16:20.939 --> 16:25.027
Well, in that case,maybe you could make your own?

16:25.110 --> 16:28.572
Yeah. I've got lots of materialsin my workshop you can use.

16:28.655 --> 16:31.658
And then you'll have one like nobody else.

16:33.327 --> 16:35.704
I guess it couldn't hurt.

16:36.747 --> 16:38.165
What do you think, pal?

16:40.000 --> 16:41.001
Ready?

16:45.172 --> 16:51.428
Presenting the Pinecone Belt-a-billion…

16:51.512 --> 16:54.681
and its amazing features.

16:54.765 --> 16:58.519
Like this lasso,

16:58.602 --> 17:02.064
and even a holster for pony treats. and even a holster for pony treats.

17:03.607 --> 17:06.944
I think you might have juststarted the coolest new trend.

17:07.944 --> 17:10.405
It still needs a little work.

17:11.156 --> 17:14.284
Why don't you go show your friends?I'm sure they'll love it.

17:14.367 --> 17:16.662
You're right.Let's go show off our belt, pal.

17:17.913 --> 17:19.998
Right after we refill your snack holster.

17:20.082 --> 17:21.083
Yeah!

17:21.165 --> 17:24.377
Hey, pals. Check out my belt.

17:25.628 --> 17:27.297
Good one, Pinecone.

17:27.381 --> 17:31.343
Where'd you get that hilarious knockoff?Is that a garden hose?

17:32.052 --> 17:34.680
I made it.

17:34.763 --> 17:38.725
Oh, right. I was just joking.

17:38.809 --> 17:41.937
A garden hose? So cool.

17:42.020 --> 17:44.565
-Very cool.-And practical.

17:44.648 --> 17:46.149
Thanks.

17:46.233 --> 17:51.363
My belt isn't going to cut it, Pony.I need a Bountiful Belt of my own.

17:51.905 --> 17:56.118
We have to find Granny and order a beltfor next time she's in town.

17:56.201 --> 17:57.452
There she is!

18:08.839 --> 18:11.925
Granny's a witch. A really good one.

18:12.009 --> 18:15.012
Thanks for being patient, my sweets.

18:15.095 --> 18:19.516
The people of Sturdystonewere as gullible as we'd hoped.

18:19.600 --> 18:23.770
I got a dynamite haul of itemsfor my potions.

18:23.854 --> 18:29.735
And now I can losethis stuffy old granny disguise.

18:35.490 --> 18:37.659
We'd better go warn people about Granny.

18:39.161 --> 18:42.539
Everyone! Granny Cutie'sa powerful witch in disguise.

18:42.623 --> 18:44.374
Yeah, we know.

18:44.458 --> 18:47.085
The belts must've been glamouredto look cool.

18:47.169 --> 18:50.380
Once the spell wore off,they revealed their true form.

18:51.965 --> 18:55.427
The pixie dust turned backinto regular dust.

18:56.178 --> 18:59.681
Everything that came outof the wish pocket disappeared.

18:59.765 --> 19:01.391
Like Howard. Like Howard.

19:01.475 --> 19:03.810
-Huh?-My new watering can.

19:03.894 --> 19:06.980
Well, I just saw Grannytransform into a fancy lady.

19:07.064 --> 19:09.775
And a big flock of birds turnedinto her horse.

19:10.984 --> 19:12.945
Were the birds black-and-white?

19:14.696 --> 19:16.406
She got me again.

19:17.658 --> 19:22.579
Magpie, a powerful shape-shifterand a total charlatan.

19:22.663 --> 19:25.415
She's tricked me more timesthan I choose to admit.

19:27.543 --> 19:30.629
Twelve, okay? She's tricked me 12 times.

19:30.712 --> 19:35.592
But I don't get it. Why would Magpiewant all our worn-out old things?

19:35.676 --> 19:38.720
They weren't special, except to us.

19:38.804 --> 19:42.933
Exactly. She'll probablyuse them for spells.

19:43.016 --> 19:47.187
It's amazing how many potionscall for the treasured object of a child.

19:47.813 --> 19:50.148
There must be something we can do.

19:50.858 --> 19:52.860
There certainly is.

19:52.943 --> 19:55.571
Lodge a complaintwith The Better Wizarding Bureau.

19:56.697 --> 19:57.739
Excuse me.

19:58.657 --> 20:03.036
We can get everything backfrom Magpie ourselves. We can get everything backfrom Magpie ourselves.

20:03.120 --> 20:06.832
All we need is the ultimate utility belt.

20:08.542 --> 20:09.585
Pinecone,

20:09.668 --> 20:13.130
we don't haveour Bountiful Belts anymore, remember?

20:13.213 --> 20:15.924
We don't need Bountiful Belts.

20:17.050 --> 20:19.052
We can make our own.

20:24.808 --> 20:30.105
You're not going anywhere, Magpie.Not till you give us our stuff back.

20:30.189 --> 20:32.816
And how are you going to stop me?

20:32.900 --> 20:34.860
With our belts.

20:34.943 --> 20:39.031
On my signal. In three, two, one!

20:42.534 --> 20:44.036
What is going on?

20:44.119 --> 20:46.205
Seed attack.

20:48.916 --> 20:50.042
Hey.

20:51.043 --> 20:52.336
You've been jammed.

20:52.961 --> 20:55.881
My wand-- Blueberry jam?

20:56.590 --> 20:59.176
It's delicious, yet destructive.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.685
Confetti pocket.

21:09.686 --> 21:11.188
Confetti?

21:12.523 --> 21:14.441
Hooray!

21:14.525 --> 21:18.403
You think you can beat me that easily?

21:18.487 --> 21:21.073
My sweets, attack!

21:26.745 --> 21:27.996
Oh, no.

21:31.667 --> 21:33.001
Water me, Pony.

21:42.719 --> 21:45.764
My sweets, come back!

21:45.848 --> 21:48.559
I can't pull this cart myself.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.520
Kids are the worst.

21:52.729 --> 21:53.814
We did it!

21:53.897 --> 21:55.399
We got our stuff back!

21:56.567 --> 21:58.527
My all seasons snow globe!

21:59.111 --> 22:01.947
Without you, I had to lookat only snow-related globes. Without you, I had to lookat only snow-related globes.

22:02.573 --> 22:04.491
It was a dark time.

22:04.575 --> 22:07.536
And my old wizard's cap is back in action.

22:09.329 --> 22:11.957
Not only do we have our things back,

22:12.040 --> 22:14.877
but we have these cool new belts.

22:14.960 --> 22:17.546
Which are made just for us.

22:18.380 --> 22:20.674
Could you kids help me make a belt?

22:21.466 --> 22:22.759
Reba wants one too.

22:22.843 --> 22:23.927
-I want one too.-So do we!

22:24.011 --> 22:25.179
-I want one too.-Hooray!

22:25.762 --> 22:28.473
I guess we did startthe coolest new trend.

22:28.557 --> 22:29.766
Pony treat?

22:35.480 --> 22:37.274
You and I

22:37.357 --> 22:40.027
Adventurers brave and free

22:40.903 --> 22:45.157
Side by sideTogether we'll always be

22:45.240 --> 22:49.745
Thick as thieves

22:50.787 --> 22:55.209
Thick as thieves
