WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:03.040
Madame de Clermont?
I am Benjamin Fuchs.

00:03.200 --> 00:05.440
-Stop screaming!
-No!

00:05.600 --> 00:08.520
I've located a letter
written by Edward Kelley.

00:08.680 --> 00:11.360
It proves your theory that
he tore three of its pages out.

00:11.520 --> 00:14.760
<i>Kelley bequeathed a single page</i>
<i>to each of the three species.</i>

00:14.920 --> 00:16.960
Rebecca... What are you
trying to tell us?

00:17.120 --> 00:19.480
<i>-Sarah.</i>
-Rebecca...

00:19.640 --> 00:21.840
<i>A witch born to daemons.</i>

00:22.000 --> 00:24.960
If this is true,
the witches will want the child.

00:25.120 --> 00:28.760
<i>But there is something else.</i>

00:28.920 --> 00:30.320
I'm pregnant.

00:30.480 --> 00:32.080
We have to get back to our own
time as soon as we can.

00:32.240 --> 00:33.760
What about Jack?

00:33.920 --> 00:37.360
To return to your own time,
you need to complete your training.

00:38.160 --> 00:41.800
You are a weaver,
a maker of spells.

00:41.960 --> 00:43.760
Your father was one.

00:43.920 --> 00:46.400
Guardians of the elements,
I call you.

00:46.560 --> 00:48.400
<i>He was a timewalker.</i>

00:48.560 --> 00:49.960
Now he's in a past life.

00:50.120 --> 00:53.160
We are the last of the weavers now.

01:12.520 --> 01:15.400
Which color shines brightest?

01:20.840 --> 01:22.360
Abundance.

01:28.840 --> 01:32.800
Very good. And these three
stars make the hat.

01:32.960 --> 01:36.240
-And these four make a little plough.
-Yes.

01:36.400 --> 01:38.880
Let's do other con...

01:39.040 --> 01:41.520
-Con... Const...
-Constellations.

01:41.680 --> 01:43.000
Well, that's Cassiopeia.

01:43.160 --> 01:46.800
She was a queen
of a mythical kingdom. Look.

01:46.960 --> 01:50.240
The stars are in the shape
of the letter W.

01:53.560 --> 01:56.680
-Brightening the sky.
-Mm-hmm.

02:05.440 --> 02:09.040
With the knot of eight,
the spell will wait.

02:09.200 --> 02:11.720
Ah, sense the ninth.

02:21.600 --> 02:24.600
-The plough, there!
-Yes.

02:24.760 --> 02:27.440
And look, there's the dragon's tail,

02:27.600 --> 02:29.720
where the gods
threw him into the sky

02:29.880 --> 02:31.480
and his tail twisted and froze.

02:31.640 --> 02:36.840
And look, Cassiopeia is
still clinging to her throne.

02:37.000 --> 02:39.720
Stargazing in London.

02:41.520 --> 02:43.160
Now that's magic.

02:53.600 --> 02:58.200
A knot about completion
is never easy.

02:58.360 --> 03:02.640
Still, you're almost there.

03:10.800 --> 03:13.200
Sorry.

03:21.720 --> 03:23.480
Diana?

03:26.320 --> 03:30.960
Another weaver
has arrived in London.

03:31.120 --> 03:34.000
I felt their presence.

03:34.160 --> 03:36.880
I thought we're the only ones left.

03:39.440 --> 03:43.280
We will wait until
they make themselves known.

03:43.440 --> 03:47.120
Their arrival here
will be no accident.

04:53.120 --> 04:55.040
-Hi, are you Agatha?
-Agatha Wilson.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.880
-This is my family.
-Welcome. Sarah Bishop.

04:57.040 --> 04:58.840
So good to see you again.

04:59.000 --> 05:01.560
-Congratulations.
-Agatha Wilson.

05:01.720 --> 05:03.880
I can't tell you
how much we appreciate this.

05:04.040 --> 05:06.320
Let's get everyone inside.

05:08.000 --> 05:09.520
That way.

05:14.240 --> 05:16.360
It's not too late
to turn back.

05:16.520 --> 05:20.520
Being with me,
it might be dangerous.

05:20.680 --> 05:24.080
Whatever's coming, I'm ready.

05:24.240 --> 05:28.200
There's a whole world out there.
And I wanna see it all.

05:28.360 --> 05:31.760
This, it's a privilege.

05:44.680 --> 05:46.800
I hope you don't mind two more.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.160
The chateau feels alive again.

05:49.320 --> 05:52.200
Marthe's loving every minute.

05:52.360 --> 05:56.320
This is Phoebe Taylor, my partner.

05:58.640 --> 06:02.680
-Miss Taylor.
-Uh, call me Phoebe.

06:02.840 --> 06:05.200
Marcus has told me
so much about you.

06:05.360 --> 06:07.240
It's a real honor to meet you.

06:07.400 --> 06:10.160
Well, I hope I don't disappoint.

06:24.360 --> 06:26.320
I wanna get Jack
a new book.

06:26.480 --> 06:28.680
-Of course.
-Hello.

06:28.840 --> 06:30.400
My lady.

06:38.240 --> 06:40.200
That's strange.

06:41.080 --> 06:43.800
-I smell coffee.
-No.

06:43.960 --> 06:46.000
Coffee won't arrive for decades.

06:47.480 --> 06:49.080
Timewalker, Diana.

06:54.000 --> 06:56.240
-Who are you?
-Dad?

06:58.560 --> 07:00.080
Diana?

07:21.960 --> 07:25.480
You... You look
just the same.

07:25.640 --> 07:28.520
You were riding a tricycle
two days ago.

07:28.680 --> 07:31.040
I think we all need this.

07:39.000 --> 07:42.720
So you're the vampire
Rebecca saw in her visions.

07:42.880 --> 07:44.600
-Is this where you met?
-No.

07:44.760 --> 07:47.600
I brought Matthew with me.

07:47.760 --> 07:49.760
You're a good timewalker then.

07:49.920 --> 07:52.320
Any progress with the ninth knot?

07:52.480 --> 07:54.920
Goody says it can't be rushed.

08:02.200 --> 08:04.280
Are you looking for these?

08:04.440 --> 08:07.520
-That's where I left 'em.
-You left them on the floor

08:07.680 --> 08:11.200
and Francoise nearly
slipped down the stairs.

08:12.520 --> 08:14.680
Off you go.

08:18.760 --> 08:21.160
How long has he been with you?

08:21.320 --> 08:25.840
Forgive me, Stephen,
but why are you here?

08:26.000 --> 08:29.320
I'm an anthropologist.
I'm here to observe.

08:32.240 --> 08:36.160
And to look for something.
An alchemical book.

08:36.320 --> 08:39.240
<i>Ashmole 782.</i>

08:39.400 --> 08:40.960
We have it.

08:45.040 --> 08:47.320
It won't let me read it.

08:47.480 --> 08:51.560
Maybe because three pages
have been ripped out.

08:51.720 --> 08:56.240
There's a strange image
of the Tree of Life.

08:56.400 --> 08:58.880
One of two dragons
shedding their blood.

08:59.040 --> 09:01.600
And then the page
that was sent to Diana.

09:04.800 --> 09:07.680
It's postmarked from Jerusalem.

09:07.840 --> 09:11.920
Arrived out of the blue.
Jewish witches, we presume.

09:12.080 --> 09:13.680
Rabbi Loew.

09:15.160 --> 09:17.200
It is possible, I suppose.

09:17.360 --> 09:21.480
Maybe he got the page from Kelley
and he kept it safe for you.

09:21.640 --> 09:24.480
I'd always assumed
if I found it in this time,

09:24.640 --> 09:28.320
the text wouldn't be hidden,
and I'd be able to study it.

09:28.480 --> 09:30.400
Shame you can't read it.

09:30.560 --> 09:32.160
There are other ways.

09:32.320 --> 09:35.360
The vellum is made
from the skin of creatures.

09:36.560 --> 09:40.280
The DNA that it contains
could hold many answers.

09:40.440 --> 09:42.880
Its importance
goes beyond mere research.

09:43.040 --> 09:45.800
Powerful creatures
are looking for it.

09:45.960 --> 09:49.000
Including a witch
from the Congregation.

09:50.520 --> 09:52.440
Peter Knox.

09:52.600 --> 09:54.400
Well, well, well...

09:56.160 --> 09:59.400
I hope he doesn't know
there's dark magic in it.

09:59.560 --> 10:02.120
Peter's obsessed with the dark arts.

10:08.000 --> 10:10.240
<i>Sooner or later,</i>
<i>the witch baby will be placed</i>

10:10.400 --> 10:11.720
<i>with their own kind.</i>

10:11.880 --> 10:14.240
But our priority has to be

10:14.400 --> 10:16.000
the missing pages
from the <i>Book of Life.</i>

10:16.160 --> 10:20.680
Ysabeau de Clermont knows something,
but she's refusing to cooperate.

10:20.840 --> 10:23.920
None of my contacts
are aware of the witch's page.

10:24.080 --> 10:26.840
It's possible that
Diana Bishop's aunts

10:27.000 --> 10:28.760
already have it.

10:28.920 --> 10:31.680
But they've gone to ground.

10:31.840 --> 10:35.040
I have reason to believe
they're being sheltered

10:35.200 --> 10:36.720
at Salvatore.

10:36.880 --> 10:41.000
Sadly, Ysabeau's stance on witches
has softened considerably.

10:42.080 --> 10:43.760
Then they must be removed.

10:43.920 --> 10:48.360
The de Clermonts
won't give them up easily.

10:48.520 --> 10:53.560
It would take a powerful witch

10:53.720 --> 10:55.600
to get close.

10:55.760 --> 10:58.240
I'm not your hunting dog, Gerbert.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.240
Fetch.

11:16.320 --> 11:18.880
How did you think
you could keep this going?

11:21.000 --> 11:22.440
You've stayed too long.

11:22.600 --> 11:25.680
Adopted a child and stolen a book
from the Hapsburg emperor.

11:25.840 --> 11:29.280
-I was here before, Stephen.
-I'm aware of that, Matthew.

11:29.440 --> 11:34.400
Yes...
We screwed up.

11:34.560 --> 11:37.800
You broke the rules of timewalking.

11:37.960 --> 11:40.880
To observe, not participate.

11:41.040 --> 11:43.000
You need to go.

11:44.040 --> 11:46.320
And leave the book behind.

11:46.480 --> 11:50.800
I intended to study the book
in this time, not take it with me.

11:50.960 --> 11:54.960
No. The book's coming with us.
We need to find the missing pages.

11:55.120 --> 11:57.200
And analyze it.
As a biochemist, I need to...

11:57.360 --> 11:59.720
I don't care
if you're Charles Darwin.

11:59.880 --> 12:04.280
You can't timewalk with a powerful
object you don't understand.

12:06.920 --> 12:09.880
You've already messed with history.

12:10.040 --> 12:13.080
You won't find your answers here.

12:14.480 --> 12:17.160
The book stays.

12:23.160 --> 12:26.200
Peter Knox is getting out of hand.
He stalked Diana,

12:26.360 --> 12:29.560
intimidated the Madison Coven
and now he's threatening babies.

12:29.720 --> 12:31.280
I mean, can't the Congregation
do something?

12:31.440 --> 12:34.400
I know how they work.
They'll have a debate,

12:34.560 --> 12:38.920
take his side
and full segregation of the species.

12:39.080 --> 12:42.720
Sooner or later, they're gonna
come for Margaret.

12:42.880 --> 12:46.000
When Matthew and Diana come back,
they're gonna come for them too.

12:46.160 --> 12:49.360
The only way that
everyone can be safe

12:49.520 --> 12:52.000
is if we repeal the covenant.

12:52.160 --> 12:55.160
I'm not sure you fully comprehend
what you're suggesting.

12:55.320 --> 12:57.400
Philippe created
the covenant centuries ago

12:57.560 --> 13:00.280
and yeah, sure, no doubt
there was a reason for it then.

13:00.440 --> 13:02.000
But the world has changed.

13:02.160 --> 13:04.520
Those same rules
that were keeping us safe

13:04.680 --> 13:06.800
are now pulling us apart.

13:06.960 --> 13:08.920
Marcus is right.

13:09.080 --> 13:12.440
Humans may be destructive,
but at least they're inventive.

13:12.600 --> 13:14.720
They change their minds.

13:14.880 --> 13:17.360
What does the covenant
actually stand for today?

13:17.520 --> 13:20.600
Segregation? Discrimination?

13:20.760 --> 13:23.680
We need to evolve
if we want to survive.

13:23.840 --> 13:26.840
Hasn't the change already started?

13:28.280 --> 13:31.480
I mean, look at this table.

13:31.640 --> 13:34.240
Four species dining together.

13:34.400 --> 13:35.960
From what Marcus has told me,

13:36.120 --> 13:38.880
that's not something
that happens very often.

13:39.040 --> 13:40.560
Look, um...

13:40.720 --> 13:44.080
I know I'm new to all this,
and I don't mean to be rude,

13:44.240 --> 13:49.160
but it seems pretty obvious
that the only way forward

13:49.320 --> 13:51.120
is together.

14:08.520 --> 14:12.120
Sorry, I...
I got lost on the...

14:14.240 --> 14:19.560
You have a beautiful home.
I've been dying to snoop around.

14:19.720 --> 14:21.440
Snoop away.

14:29.600 --> 14:31.600
Is this 16th century?

14:31.760 --> 14:36.040
Philippe picked it up in Rome,
if I recall.

14:36.200 --> 14:38.400
It's so well preserved.

14:38.560 --> 14:40.800
Marcus has placed
a great deal of trust in you,

14:40.960 --> 14:44.440
revealing himself,
introducing you to this world.

14:44.600 --> 14:47.760
I know,
and I won't let him down.

14:47.920 --> 14:50.760
This must be quite overwhelming.

14:50.920 --> 14:54.520
I'm the only human
in an ancient chateau

14:54.680 --> 14:58.040
filled with vampires,
witches and daemons.

14:58.200 --> 15:00.320
A lesser human would be afraid.

15:00.480 --> 15:03.480
Humans have so much potential.

15:03.640 --> 15:06.560
But our capacity
to hate and discriminate, well,

15:06.720 --> 15:09.600
that scares me
more than any of this.

15:22.680 --> 15:25.040
This collection is incredible.

15:28.560 --> 15:32.720
-Is everything okay?
-I'd like a moment with my grandson.

15:32.880 --> 15:34.960
Sure.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.160
You've made an excellent choice.

15:43.320 --> 15:44.760
I know.

15:45.880 --> 15:47.200
Maybe she's right.

15:47.360 --> 15:49.920
Perhaps today
is the start of something.

15:50.080 --> 15:54.120
You're right to criticize
our conservatism.

15:54.280 --> 15:59.520
Philippe was one of the most humane
and progressive men who ever lived.

15:59.680 --> 16:01.120
Always adapting.

16:01.280 --> 16:05.760
He believed in hope
for all creatures.

16:05.920 --> 16:07.840
I wish he was here.

16:10.120 --> 16:15.720
Grief carves a place in the heart
and sits there forever.

16:15.880 --> 16:19.360
But when focused,
it can be a powerful motivator.

16:19.520 --> 16:22.240
Sadness becomes resolve

16:22.400 --> 16:26.640
and pain becomes action.

16:42.480 --> 16:44.160
Gallowglass.

16:48.120 --> 16:52.640
My days as Matthew Roydon in London
are coming to an end.

16:55.760 --> 16:58.440
Diana and I are returning
to our own time.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.120
There are a few loose ends
to tie up, I'm afraid.

17:02.280 --> 17:04.320
But you will get the old me back.

17:07.960 --> 17:09.560
In truth...

17:11.640 --> 17:14.160
I prefer the future you.

17:14.320 --> 17:16.040
Hmm.

17:18.360 --> 17:22.320
<i>You have an opportunityto study magic</i>
<i>with one of England's greatest witches.</i>

17:22.480 --> 17:24.440
You can't waste it.

17:26.560 --> 17:29.000
Tell me about the ninth knot.

17:29.160 --> 17:33.560
Ah, well, it's hard to learn,
as you know.

17:33.720 --> 17:37.160
I'm self-taught.
I never learned formal knots.

17:39.400 --> 17:42.200
It's, uh, magic.
I need to tie it well.

17:42.360 --> 17:43.920
I figured as much.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.720
Are you afraid of it?

17:50.440 --> 17:52.320
No.

17:52.480 --> 17:55.880
You should see what I can do
with my magic now.

17:56.840 --> 18:00.200
Lack of ability
will never be your problem.

18:00.360 --> 18:03.960
But desire, maybe?

18:04.960 --> 18:08.360
If you complete it, you have to go.

18:11.000 --> 18:14.360
Yeah.
This way.

18:20.880 --> 18:24.120
I sensed you found the weaver.

18:30.960 --> 18:33.160
Focus, Diana.

18:33.320 --> 18:36.440
-Keep hold of the blue.
-It's pulling away.

18:36.600 --> 18:39.120
Stop trying so hard.

18:40.960 --> 18:43.760
Your father speaks sense.

18:43.920 --> 18:47.920
Allow your magic to flow naturally.

18:49.920 --> 18:54.440
Exactly.
You're not lassoing a bull.

19:23.240 --> 19:25.320
With the knot of nine

19:25.480 --> 19:27.680
the spell be mine.

19:34.320 --> 19:37.520
Some witches would kill
for that kind of power.

19:40.960 --> 19:42.480
What did I say?

19:44.360 --> 19:45.920
Diana,

19:46.080 --> 19:50.360
speak your truth. It serves
no purpose to withhold it.

19:53.960 --> 19:56.600
I will say my good nights.

20:08.000 --> 20:11.280
There's so much I wanna tell you.

20:14.880 --> 20:16.280
I am...

20:17.440 --> 20:20.800
terrified
of changing anything.

20:20.960 --> 20:24.720
And yet I'm desperate
to change everything.

20:27.160 --> 20:31.000
Nothing can keep your mom
and me from our fate, Diana.

20:32.240 --> 20:34.680
We haven't seen what's to come.

20:34.840 --> 20:37.240
We know our time with you is short.

20:39.760 --> 20:42.560
Make peace with it, honey.

20:44.240 --> 20:47.000
It's part of a whole tapestry.

20:48.440 --> 20:50.800
Like your child to come.

20:53.640 --> 20:56.960
I... I wanted to tell you.

20:57.120 --> 20:59.160
Your mom saw it.

21:01.200 --> 21:06.000
Congratulations.
A child is a precious gift.

21:07.320 --> 21:09.080
I should know.

21:13.720 --> 21:15.840
It's time I, uh...

21:17.440 --> 21:18.800
took a stroll.

21:22.600 --> 21:27.040
You're everything we dreamed
you'd one day become.

21:41.080 --> 21:42.560
I'll see you later.

21:44.320 --> 21:45.800
I'll see you, Dad.

22:15.920 --> 22:19.400
Right. Everything
as it was, near enough.

22:21.680 --> 22:24.000
Now I know how you feel,
leaving a life behind.

22:24.160 --> 22:27.360
Yes, it's always bittersweet.

22:27.520 --> 22:29.760
I find it best to concentrate...

22:30.800 --> 22:32.960
on the sweet.

22:33.120 --> 22:36.200
-Like seeing our families.
-Mmm.

22:36.360 --> 22:39.400
We asked a lot of them coming here,

22:39.560 --> 22:42.920
not knowing what they've
been through is unbearable.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.120
Or what we'll confront
on our return.

22:45.280 --> 22:48.360
We just need to find the missing pages
before the Congregation do.

22:48.520 --> 22:50.840
At least we know
what we're looking for.

22:51.000 --> 22:55.160
And you're never happier than when you
have a library catalog in front of you.

22:59.760 --> 23:01.600
Oh, Jack.

23:02.560 --> 23:04.880
Henry will look after him.

23:05.040 --> 23:07.880
He'll be well treated
in the Percy household.

23:08.040 --> 23:09.480
And when he comes of age?

23:09.640 --> 23:12.480
He'll be apprenticed
into a good trade.

23:12.640 --> 23:15.160
It's a better life than the one
he had before we met him.

23:15.320 --> 23:17.880
And with humans, not creatures.

23:18.880 --> 23:21.160
Who will watch out for him?

23:30.240 --> 23:32.880
-I'm happy to wait, Auntie.
-Oh, that's okay.

23:33.040 --> 23:34.840
Saying goodbye to the coven
may take a while.

23:35.000 --> 23:37.040
Susanna will bring me home.

23:53.000 --> 23:55.640
This is an unusual request.

23:55.800 --> 23:58.400
No one will suspect us meeting here.

24:00.400 --> 24:02.680
I need to talk about Jack.

24:03.880 --> 24:06.520
We're leaving London.
I need your help.

24:06.680 --> 24:08.240
I've seen how you protect your own.

24:08.400 --> 24:11.800
He is not my child.
Nor you.

24:11.960 --> 24:16.240
If I were, would you honor
my request about Jack?

24:24.760 --> 24:27.960
If you offer me your blood.

24:28.120 --> 24:30.160
I will give you my blood...

24:31.000 --> 24:33.320
but in a way Matthew
will not pick up your scent.

24:33.480 --> 24:35.680
He cannot know about our pact.

24:35.840 --> 24:37.280
I will open a vein

24:37.440 --> 24:40.320
and let a single drop
fall into your mouth.

24:45.480 --> 24:47.560
I accept your terms.

25:09.720 --> 25:13.960
What is blood,
if not fire and water?

25:34.680 --> 25:37.200
Are you a man of your word?

25:37.360 --> 25:39.560
God wills it.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.400
I will watch over the child.

25:46.160 --> 25:49.400
Farewell, Diana Bishop.

25:55.080 --> 25:56.480
Farewell.

26:14.400 --> 26:17.360
Have you made peace
with your decision?

26:18.520 --> 26:21.520
Yes. As much as I can.

26:22.480 --> 26:24.800
Then go you must.

26:25.840 --> 26:29.880
There is one final knot
that you may need.

26:30.920 --> 26:36.080
It's a weaving of
creation and destruction.

26:36.240 --> 26:38.400
Endings and beginnings.

26:38.560 --> 26:41.560
Only a weaver
who stands between worlds

26:41.720 --> 26:43.720
can complete it.

26:43.880 --> 26:46.120
I cannot make it myself.

26:59.760 --> 27:01.840
Remember it, Diana.

27:07.360 --> 27:09.760
My heart
is heavy to see you go.

27:09.920 --> 27:12.080
You have given
me so much, Goody,

27:12.240 --> 27:14.400
your time, wisdom.

27:14.560 --> 27:19.600
I won't ever forget you.
Or what you've done for me.

27:29.680 --> 27:31.760
Take this.

27:33.720 --> 27:35.920
A descendant of yours will
give it to me in the future.

27:36.080 --> 27:39.480
Keep it safe in your family.

27:39.640 --> 27:41.280
You have my word.

28:18.400 --> 28:21.240
You finally grace us
with your presence.

28:25.720 --> 28:27.400
I've been busy.

28:32.560 --> 28:34.000
Sept-Tours.

28:35.480 --> 28:39.320
The Bishop witches are
in the vampire stronghold.

28:39.480 --> 28:41.800
But I intend to flush them out.

28:41.960 --> 28:44.120
There's a ruined temple nearby.

28:44.280 --> 28:47.360
Its magical properties
could be exploited.

28:52.200 --> 28:55.120
If you go into Sept-Tours,

28:55.280 --> 28:58.080
I'd be a powerful ally.

28:59.760 --> 29:03.680
This is a job for a spell caster.

29:03.840 --> 29:06.680
I won't be needing
your pyrotechnics.

29:07.880 --> 29:10.200
Your confidence
will be your downfall.

29:33.520 --> 29:37.000
Hard at work, Andrew?
Benjamin.

29:37.160 --> 29:41.280
-I wasn't expecting...
-So many souls to save.

29:41.440 --> 29:43.280
I thought you had
business in Bohemia.

29:43.440 --> 29:45.320
I followed it here.

29:46.680 --> 29:48.720
Tell me about that witch you met.

29:48.880 --> 29:52.120
-She's one of my flock.
-I cannot share her history.

29:52.280 --> 29:54.920
That is no way
to speak to your sire.

29:56.040 --> 30:00.480
Now... Tell me
about Matthew's witch.

30:39.360 --> 30:41.720
I know
you took those portraits.

30:41.880 --> 30:44.720
And I know you've been
killing humans.

30:50.680 --> 30:56.160
This has something to do with
Matthew and Diana, doesn't it?

30:56.320 --> 30:59.040
What is it you want?

31:01.040 --> 31:04.440
Show me who you are.
Let me help you.

32:00.760 --> 32:03.840
I just have to trust
that it'll reappear

32:04.000 --> 32:07.520
when we find the pages
to make it whole again.

32:08.680 --> 32:12.200
We've achieved everything
that we set out to.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.400
Yes.

32:15.960 --> 32:19.880
We should timewalk tonight
to Sept-Tours.

32:20.040 --> 32:21.680
We'll be safe there.

32:21.840 --> 32:24.200
Are you sure you're ready?

32:26.120 --> 32:28.440
It's time.

32:28.600 --> 32:30.080
Thanks for doing this.

32:30.240 --> 32:35.280
It has to be returned to Dr. Dee,
so it can find its way back to me.

32:35.440 --> 32:38.640
I'll take care of it.
I promise.

32:38.800 --> 32:42.360
I'm gonna miss you.

32:42.520 --> 32:44.440
Ah, it's been an adventure.

32:44.600 --> 32:49.360
Keep the other Matthew safe for me,
so he can find me one day.

33:03.920 --> 33:05.720
I'll be off then.

33:06.880 --> 33:10.560
-Got some mopping up to do.
-Thank you for everything.

33:17.640 --> 33:19.560
Goodbye, Matthew.

33:40.440 --> 33:42.520
We wish you well, mistress.

33:42.680 --> 33:44.680
You too.

33:45.680 --> 33:47.040
Come along.

33:47.200 --> 33:49.560
Let's go and see what Henry
Percy's house is like.

33:49.720 --> 33:51.720
I don't want to go.

33:51.880 --> 33:54.720
Oh... Sweetheart.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.560
I want to stay with you.

33:56.720 --> 33:58.560
You can't come
with us this time, Jack.

33:58.720 --> 34:01.920
London is your home.
You need to stay here.

34:02.080 --> 34:07.400
You'll be happy once you settle.
I promise.

34:11.640 --> 34:13.560
Here.

34:16.360 --> 34:18.600
To replace the stolen one.

34:23.000 --> 34:24.520
Come here.

34:28.640 --> 34:31.080
I'm proud of you, Jack.

34:36.440 --> 34:39.720
Come along. Come on.

34:43.360 --> 34:45.560
Be brave.

36:00.960 --> 36:04.440
I harness the power of this site

36:04.600 --> 36:07.960
to draw those who are connected.

36:08.960 --> 36:10.920
Wrest them from their slumber.

36:14.880 --> 36:18.280
I harness the power of this site

36:18.440 --> 36:21.280
to draw those who are connected.

36:21.440 --> 36:24.400
Wrest them from their slumber
and carry them forth.

36:24.560 --> 36:28.960
I harness the power of this site
to draw those who are connected.

36:29.120 --> 36:32.240
Wrest them from their slumber
and carry them forth.

36:36.000 --> 36:40.280
Wrest them from their slumber
and carry them forth.

36:40.440 --> 36:44.200
I harness the power of this site...

37:22.640 --> 37:25.920
I'm so sorry. We... We don't
know what's wrong with her.

37:26.080 --> 37:29.280
It's okay. I just heard
the front door.

37:30.280 --> 37:31.960
Where is Em?

37:34.000 --> 37:35.440
Shepherd my guiding spirits

37:35.600 --> 37:38.320
and bind me to the person
in my thoughts.

37:45.560 --> 37:47.600
Rebecca.

37:47.760 --> 37:49.680
Honey.

37:52.280 --> 37:54.800
<i>I can't help you.</i>

37:54.960 --> 37:57.640
No.

37:57.800 --> 38:00.280
It's Diana who needs help.

38:00.440 --> 38:02.560
We're trying to understand the book.

38:02.720 --> 38:05.120
She's connected to it somehow.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.600
<i>Understand this.</i>

38:07.760 --> 38:11.120
<i>There will be dark times</i>
<i>and great losses.</i>

38:11.280 --> 38:14.120
<i>But the book will change everything.</i>

38:14.280 --> 38:17.200
-Rebecca.
<i>-Once it's completed,</i>

38:17.360 --> 38:20.480
<i>the book is going to reveal itself.</i>

38:20.640 --> 38:24.720
But we only have this page.
How do we complete it?

38:24.880 --> 38:27.320
Where are the other pages?

38:27.480 --> 38:31.080
<i>You're in danger.</i>
<i>He wants the page.</i>

38:37.240 --> 38:40.440
-Bring it back.
-Never.

38:40.600 --> 38:43.760
Give me... the page.

38:43.920 --> 38:45.920
Go to hell!

38:50.560 --> 38:55.440
You are so consumed
with power and greed.

38:55.600 --> 38:58.400
You lost your soul to the darkness.

38:58.560 --> 39:02.040
Surrender the page.

39:05.520 --> 39:07.040
I've searched the house.
She's not here.

39:07.200 --> 39:10.280
She's taken what she needs.
I know where she's gone.

39:13.560 --> 39:16.080
Can you sense her?

39:16.240 --> 39:19.240
There's someone else close by.

39:20.320 --> 39:21.720
A powerful creature.

39:21.880 --> 39:24.000
Protect the baby.

39:25.760 --> 39:28.480
I am not afraid of you, Peter.

39:28.640 --> 39:33.440
I will always fight for Diana.
She will always come first.

39:33.600 --> 39:37.280
-She abandoned you.
-She will be back!

39:37.440 --> 39:41.120
She will be more powerful
than you can imagine.

39:41.280 --> 39:42.640
The page!

39:42.800 --> 39:45.880
Diana will unite all creatures

39:46.040 --> 39:47.840
against bigots like you.

39:56.400 --> 39:59.680
And she will avenge me!

40:31.480 --> 40:33.280
You threatened my friends.

40:33.440 --> 40:37.800
And now you dare to come here,
to my territory.

40:37.960 --> 40:40.800
The witches belong to me.

40:48.360 --> 40:52.480
Young bucks should never
break from the herd.

40:53.960 --> 40:58.920
Now, you pay the price.

40:59.080 --> 41:02.840
This is de Clermont land.

41:03.000 --> 41:05.640
Em! Em!

41:05.800 --> 41:08.040
Kill me here...

41:08.200 --> 41:12.080
and you'll start a war
that you have no hope winning.

41:14.920 --> 41:16.880
You wouldn't dare!

41:18.320 --> 41:19.840
Sleep now.

41:21.000 --> 41:22.840
Em!

41:25.800 --> 41:28.120
Em!

41:28.280 --> 41:30.800
Em, wake up.

41:30.960 --> 41:33.360
Wake up, please!

41:33.520 --> 41:35.680
Em, wake up.

41:38.720 --> 41:42.680
Thank you for sharing this world
with me.

41:42.840 --> 41:45.880
I'm glad I got
to know Matthew Roydon.

41:48.320 --> 41:51.160
I've had so many roles in my life.

41:52.520 --> 41:57.200
But to be a husband
and a father again...

41:58.880 --> 42:00.520
that's all I've ever wanted.

42:02.320 --> 42:04.760
Endings and beginnings.

42:18.480 --> 42:21.400
Let's go meet our future.

42:41.920 --> 42:44.800
Come on. Come on, Em.

42:44.960 --> 42:47.920
Please. Please.

42:48.080 --> 42:50.520
Come on, darling.
