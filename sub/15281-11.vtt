WEBVTT

00:00.800 --> 00:05.499
CAPTIONING MADE POSSIBLE BY CBS

00:25.190 --> 00:26.282
* YOUR HEAD WILL COLLAPSE

00:30.830 --> 00:33.219
* WHERE IS MY MIND?

00:33.260 --> 00:35.728
* WHERE IS MY MIND?

00:35.760 --> 00:40.094
* WHERE IS MY MIND?

01:21.180 --> 01:21.805
YOU'RE DR. REID.

01:21.840 --> 01:23.705
I'M SORRY. DO I KNOW YOU?

01:23.750 --> 01:26.241
I JUST KNOW
WHAT YOU DO.

01:26.280 --> 01:27.110
OK.

01:27.150 --> 01:29.880
I SAW YOU IN GEORGETOWN
A FEW WEEKS AGO.

01:29.920 --> 01:31.740
YOU GAVE A LECTURE
ON SEXUAL SADISM

01:31.790 --> 01:35.578
AND HOW YOU HELPED
CATCH THE MILL CREEK
KILLER IN ST. LOUIS.

01:35.620 --> 01:38.123
I-I'M NOT MUCH OF A, UH--
A PUBLIC SPEAKER.

01:38.160 --> 01:40.458
I DON'T KNOW.
I THOUGHT YOU
SEEMED COOL.

01:40.500 --> 01:43.162
YOU LOOK KIND OF YOUNG
TO GO TO GEORGETOWN.

01:43.200 --> 01:45.691
UM, I'M A JUNIOR AT
NORTHWEST HIGH SCHOOL.

01:45.730 --> 01:49.268
AND YOU JUST GO TO LECTURES
ON ANGER EXCITATION FOR FUN?

01:49.310 --> 01:51.437
I DON'T HAVE
A LOT OF FRIENDS.

01:51.470 --> 01:53.131
SO YOU'RE INTERESTED
IN PROFILING?

01:53.180 --> 01:55.478
YEAH. I MEAN,
I READ A LOT,
YOU KNOW, TRUE CRIME,

01:55.510 --> 01:56.340
LIKE GRAPHIC NOVELS,
MOSTLY.

01:56.380 --> 01:57.540
THEY'RE ALL ABOUT
WHETHER THERE'S REALLY

01:57.580 --> 02:00.708
SUCH A THING AS EVIL,
LIKE NATURE VERSUS
NURTURE, ALL THAT,

02:00.750 --> 02:05.187
SO I FIGURED IT'D BE
SMART TO HEAR IT FROM
AN EXPERT, YOU KNOW?

02:05.220 --> 02:06.482
SO YOU SAID A LOT OF 'EM
KILL PROSTITUTES?

02:06.520 --> 02:10.229
IT'S THE NUMBER ONE
SERIAL KILLER TARGET, ACTUALLY.

02:10.260 --> 02:12.319
WELL, IS THAT FOR SEX
OR BECAUSE THEY THINK

02:12.360 --> 02:15.693
THEY'RE DIRTY AND THEY
NEED TO BE PUNISHED?

02:16.570 --> 02:17.923
WERE YOU WAITING HERE FOR ME?

02:17.970 --> 02:20.291
WHAT WOULD IT MEAN
IF SOMEBODY WERE
STABBING THEM

02:20.340 --> 02:21.432
AND CU'I'I'ING OFF
THEIR HAIR?

02:21.470 --> 02:26.476
I'VE NEVER, UH--
I'VE NEVER HEARD OF
A CASE LIKE THAT.

02:26.510 --> 02:28.535
DO YOU WANNA GO
TO THE BAU WITH ME,

02:28.580 --> 02:30.741
MAYBE TALK TO SOME OF
MY OTHER TEAM MEMBERS?

02:30.780 --> 02:32.213
I ACTUALLY HAVE
TO GO TO SCHOOL.

02:32.250 --> 02:34.218
GIVE ME YOUR--YOUR NAME
AND YOUR NUMBER,

02:34.250 --> 02:37.287
AND I'LL CALL YOU AND...

02:44.290 --> 02:45.154
HEY, SPENCE.

02:45.190 --> 02:47.351
JJ, WHO'S YOUR CONTACT
AT THE D.C. POLICE?

02:47.400 --> 02:51.188
UH, VICTOR BARNES. WHY

02:51.230 --> 02:52.561
HI. DETECTIVE BARNES,
PLEASE.

02:52.600 --> 02:53.567
WHAT'S WRONG?

02:53.600 --> 02:54.862
NEED TO GET THAT TO EVERYONE
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE.

02:54.900 --> 02:58.336
UH, HI. DETECTIVE BARNES,
THIS IS SPECIAL AGENT
DR. SPENCER REID

02:58.370 --> 02:59.837
AT THE BEHAVIORAL ANALYSIS
UNIT AT QUANTICO.

02:59.880 --> 03:03.839
HAVE YOU HAD ANY RECENT
MURDERS INVOLVING PROSTITUTES,
MAYBE JUST JANE DOES?

03:03.880 --> 03:04.904
THEY WOULD HAVE
BEEN STABBED TO DEATH,

03:04.950 --> 03:08.716
AND THEIR HAIR WOULD'VE
BEEN CUT OFF BY THE KILLER.

03:09.790 --> 03:12.258
WHEN WAS
THE MOST RECENT VICTIM?

03:12.290 --> 03:17.387
I'LL EXPLAIN WHEN I SEE YOU.
I'LL MEET YOU IN A HALF-HOUR.

03:17.430 --> 03:18.454
WHAT'S GOING ON?

03:18.490 --> 03:20.219
D.C. MAY HAVE
A SERIAL KILLER.

03:20.260 --> 03:23.593
I THINK I JUST
LET HIM GET AWAY.

04:00.800 --> 04:02.336
T.S. ELIOT WROTE,

04:02.370 --> 04:06.272
"BETWEEN THE IDEA
AND THE REALITY,

04:06.310 --> 04:09.006
"BETWEEN THE MOTION AND THE ACT,

04:09.040 --> 04:11.645
FALLS THE SHADOW."

04:14.920 --> 04:19.311
WE FOUND HER 4 DAYS AGO
IN AN ALLEY OFF "K" STREET.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.315
STILL NO I.D.

04:20.360 --> 04:22.555
HEY. JUST GOT YOUR MESSAGE.

04:22.590 --> 04:23.955
AARON HOTCHNER,
VIC BARNES.

04:23.990 --> 04:25.548
HI. WHAT HAVE WE GOT?

04:25.590 --> 04:26.397
THIS IS
THE SECOND VICTIM.

04:26.430 --> 04:27.920
THE FIRST ONE WAS
KILLED 3 MONTHS AGO,

04:27.960 --> 04:29.325
BOTH IN
THE EARLY MORNING.

04:29.370 --> 04:30.098
BOTH HAD
THEIR HAIR CHOPPED?

04:30.130 --> 04:32.064
UNIFORM DIDN'T
MAKE THE CONNECTION,

04:32.100 --> 04:34.967
BECAUSE HE WAS
FIXATED ON THIS.

04:37.470 --> 04:40.735
THE FIRST VICTIM
DIDN'T HAVE ANYTHING
CARVED ON HER?

04:40.780 --> 04:42.577
JUST A ROUTINE JANE DOE.

04:42.610 --> 04:44.339
TAKE A LOOK.
A LOT ARE SHALLOW.

04:44.380 --> 04:45.199
TH EY' RE
H ESITATION MARKS.

04:45.250 --> 04:47.343
HE'S NOT CERTAIN HE
WANTS TO BE KILLING.

04:47.380 --> 04:49.848
MAKES YOU THINK THE MESSAGE
HE CARVED IS SINCERE.

04:49.890 --> 04:52.450
HE'S ASKING THE POLICE
TO HELP HIM STOP.

04:52.490 --> 04:54.651
FITS WITH YOUR KID
SEEKING YOU OUT.

04:54.690 --> 04:56.954
PART OF HIM WANTS
TO GET CAUGHT.

04:56.990 --> 04:58.878
I LET HIM GO. I'M SORRY.

04:58.930 --> 04:59.794
WE'LL FIND HIM.

04:59.830 --> 05:01.092
IF BOTH MURDERS TOOK
PLACE IN THE MORNING,

05:01.130 --> 05:02.222
HOW COME THERE WERE
NO WITNESSES?

05:02.260 --> 05:06.333
THE MOTELS AND ALLEYS
AROUND THE CAPITOL
ARE NOTORIOUS.

05:06.370 --> 05:09.703
PEOPLE GO OUT OF THEIR WAY
NOT TO LOOK.

05:13.940 --> 05:16.340
AT NIGHT, NO ONE
CAN SEE DOWN THERE.

05:16.380 --> 05:17.847
DURING THE DAY,
YOU JUST DUCK

05:17.880 --> 05:19.848
BEHIND THE DUMPSTER
OR INTO A DOORWAY.

05:19.880 --> 05:21.711
BUSINESS IS PRETTY HEAW
HERE IN THE MORNINGS?

05:21.750 --> 05:24.685
HOW DO I KNOW
YOU'RE NOT JUST LOOKIN'
TO CRACK DOWN ON US?

05:24.720 --> 05:27.018
BECAUSE I'M TELLING YOU.
WE'RE HERE TRYING
TO PROTECT YOU.

05:27.060 --> 05:30.086
A LOT OF JOHNS
FROM THE HILL STOP BY
ON THEIR WAY TO WORK.

05:30.130 --> 05:31.882
WE ALWAYS SAY
THE SAME POLITICIANS

05:31.930 --> 05:33.818
YELLIN' ABOUT
CLEANIN' UP
THE HILL,

05:33.860 --> 05:35.555
THE ONES DROPPIN'
50 BUCKS WITH US

05:35.600 --> 05:36.897
BEFORE THEY
MAKE THE SPEECH.

05:36.930 --> 05:37.794
IT'S TRUE,

05:37.830 --> 05:38.865
AND THE MORE IMPORTANT
THEY THINK THEY ARE,

05:38.900 --> 05:41.869
THE QUICKER
THEY ACCIDENTALLY
FINISH UP WITH US.

05:41.900 --> 05:42.901
IT'S WEIRD LIKE THAT.

05:42.940 --> 05:45.363
NO, THAT'S
PRETTY MUCH UNIVERSAL.

05:45.410 --> 05:47.401
YOU RECOGNIZE HIM
AT ALL?

05:47.440 --> 05:49.078
I DON'T KNOW HIS NAME
OR NOTHIN'.

05:49.110 --> 05:52.876
HE HANGS AROUND,
TRIES TO PRETEND LIKE
HE'S NOT WATCHING US.

05:52.920 --> 05:54.547
HE'S JUST A HORNY KID,
YOU KNOW.

05:54.580 --> 05:55.342
YOU DIDN'T SEE HIM TALKING

05:55.380 --> 05:57.018
TO ANY OF THE OTHER GIRLS
OUT HERE?

05:57.050 --> 05:58.586
I JUST FIGURED
HE'S THE KIND

05:58.620 --> 06:00.588
GETS HIS LITTLE BIT
OF DANGER
AND GOES HOME

06:00.620 --> 06:03.123
AND TAKES BUSINESS
INTO HIS OWN HANDS.

06:03.160 --> 06:04.889
IS HE THE ONE
WHO DID THIS?

06:04.930 --> 06:06.795
WE DON'T KNOW,
BUT SOMEONE DID,

06:06.830 --> 06:08.559
SO YOU NEED
TO BE CAREFUL.

06:08.600 --> 06:09.328
WE STICK
TO THE DAYLIGHT

06:09.360 --> 06:11.828
AND ONLY WORK
THE HIGH-END BLOCKS.

06:11.870 --> 06:13.098
HOW OLD ARE YOU?

06:13.140 --> 06:14.562
21.

06:16.770 --> 06:17.509
19.

06:17.540 --> 06:20.373
JUST WATCH OUT
FOR EACH OTHER, OK?

06:26.850 --> 06:28.841
OH, AGENT HOTCHNER,
KAREN STEYER.

06:28.880 --> 06:30.040
CONGRESSWOMAN,
HOW DO YOU DO?

06:30.090 --> 06:32.786
I'M FINE, THANK YOU.
THEY SAID IT WAS FINE
TO WAIT IN HERE.

06:32.820 --> 06:35.015
OF COURSE. WHAT CAN
I DO FOR YOU?

06:35.060 --> 06:36.152
WELL, I HAVE TALKED
TO MY PEOPLE,

06:36.190 --> 06:39.182
AND I UNDERSTAND THAT WE HAVE
A POTENTIAL SERIAL KILLER

06:39.230 --> 06:40.788
TARG ETING PROSTITUTES
IN D.C.

06:40.830 --> 06:42.024
THAT WAS AWFULLY FAST.

06:42.060 --> 06:43.493
I HAVE AWFULLY GOOD PEOPLE.

06:43.530 --> 06:45.464
SOUNDS LIKE IT.

06:45.500 --> 06:46.831
I'D LIKE YOU
TO PROMISE ME

06:46.870 --> 06:48.963
THAT IF YOUR TEAM
STAYS ON THE CASE,

06:49.000 --> 06:50.558
UH, YOU WON'T
PUBLICIZE THE MURDERS.

06:50.610 --> 06:53.807
I'M AFRAID I CAN'T
MAKE THAT PROMISE.

06:53.840 --> 06:55.637
WITH ALL DUE RESPECT,
YOU WILL NOTICE

06:55.680 --> 06:58.444
THAT I SAID, "IF YOU
STAY ON THE CASE."

06:58.480 --> 07:00.175
I REALLY DON'T LIKE
DOING THIS, HONESTLY,

07:00.220 --> 07:03.519
BUT AS YOU KNOW, THE BAU
CANNOT JOIN AN INVESTIGATION

07:03.550 --> 07:07.611
UNLESS THEY ARE
INVITED BY THE LOCAL
ENFORCEMENT AGENCY.

07:07.890 --> 07:08.811
WHAT'S THIS ABOUT?

07:08.860 --> 07:11.579
6 MONTHS AGO,
I INTRODUCED
A MAJOR INITIATIVE

07:11.630 --> 07:13.188
DECLARING CRIME IN D.C.
AN EPIDEMIC.

07:13.230 --> 07:14.925
I'M FAMILIAR
WITH THE BILL.

07:14.960 --> 07:17.099
MAKES ADDITIONAL
FEDERAL FUNDS AVAILABLE.

07:17.130 --> 07:20.167
YOU TARGET LIFESTYLE CRIMES
LIKE PROSTITUTION AND DRUG USE,

07:20.200 --> 07:23.135
AND HOPEFULLY
THE OVERALL CRIME RATE DROPS.

07:23.170 --> 07:24.467
WORKED IN NEW YORK.

07:24.510 --> 07:25.636
IT WORKED IN LA.
IT'S WORKED HERE.

07:25.670 --> 07:28.833
AND IN 4 DAYS, I'M SET
TO STAND AT THE BASE
OF THE CAPITOL

07:28.880 --> 07:32.714
AND ANNOUNCE
THAT PE'I'I'Y CRIME IN D.C.
IS DOWN 43%

07:32.750 --> 07:34.513
AND VIOLENT CRIME
IS DOWN 37%.

07:34.550 --> 07:37.144
THE LAST THING I NEED
IS THE PRESS ANNOUNCING

07:37.190 --> 07:40.580
THAT WE HAVE A SERIAL KILLER
MURDERING PROSTITUTES.

07:40.620 --> 07:41.655
I UNDERSTAND THAT.

07:41.690 --> 07:43.624
BUT BY NOT ALERTING
THE MEDIA,

07:43.660 --> 07:45.218
WE'RE PUTTING WOMEN
AT RISK.

07:45.260 --> 07:47.490
I'M NOT ASKING YOU
TO BACK DOWN.

07:47.530 --> 07:48.849
WORK YOUR CASE.

07:48.900 --> 07:50.492
CATCH YOUR KILLER.

07:50.530 --> 07:52.020
JUST DO IT QUIETLY.

07:52.070 --> 07:54.197
AND IF I DON'T?

07:54.240 --> 07:57.607
I GUARANTEE YOU WON'T
WORK IT AT ALL.

07:57.640 --> 08:01.098
OH, A LITTLE
UNSOLICITED ADVICE.

08:01.140 --> 08:02.471
YOU'RE DRIVEN.
YOU'RE BRIGHT.

08:02.510 --> 08:06.844
YOU'RE EXACTLY THE KIND
OF PERSON WHO COULD
RUN THE BUREAU SOMEDAY.

08:06.880 --> 08:08.518
YOU MIGHT AS WELL
ACCEPT NOW

08:08.550 --> 08:12.247
THAT LEADING THE FBI
HAS AS MUCH TO DO WITH POLITICS

08:12.290 --> 08:14.884
AS IT DOES
WITH LAW ENFORCEMENT.

08:14.920 --> 08:16.251
GOOD DAY.

08:29.770 --> 08:30.805
THIS IS IMPOSSIBLE.
SAYS YOU.

08:30.840 --> 08:32.637
THERE'S NOTHING
IN THE JUVENILE
OFFENDER RECORDS.

08:32.680 --> 08:33.999
SO YOU THINK LIKE
A HIGH SCHOOL KID.

08:34.040 --> 08:37.601
I WAS 12, AND I HADN'T
BEEN THROUGH PUBERTY
WHEN I WAS IN HIGH SCHOOL.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.538
OK, RESET.

08:39.580 --> 08:41.810
I THINK LIKE
A HIGH SCHOOL STUDENT.

08:41.850 --> 08:43.215
YOU THINK LIKE
A PROFILER.

08:43.250 --> 08:46.139
HE SAID HE WAS
A JUNIOR, RIGHT?

08:46.190 --> 08:46.884
MM-HMM.

08:46.920 --> 08:48.148
THE FIRST RULE
OF THE TEEN YEARS,

08:48.190 --> 08:49.259
WHEN TALKING TO
AN AUTHORITY FIGURE,

08:49.290 --> 08:51.121
ALWAYS LIE AND SAY
YOU'RE OLDER.

08:51.160 --> 08:52.696
HE'S PROBABLY
A SOPEIEMORE.

08:52.730 --> 08:55.290
HIS COAT WAS
LAMB'S WOOL,

08:55.330 --> 08:58.060
BUT IT DIDN'T
LOOK VINTAGE. IT...

08:58.100 --> 09:00.091
FIT LIKE IT HAD
BEEN TAILORED FOR HIM.

09:00.140 --> 09:04.236
THAT MEANS MONEY.
IN D.C., MONEY WOULD
MEAN PRIVATE SCHOOL.

09:04.270 --> 09:05.567
LOOK AT YOU GO.

09:05.610 --> 09:07.771
EVEN A LIE HAS TO BE
WITHIN THE DEPTH OF YOUR
OWN EXPERIENCE, RIGHT?

09:07.810 --> 09:09.129
FAIR ENOUGH,
FAIRLIJEHOUGH.

09:09.180 --> 09:11.148
I'M A JUNIOR
AT NORTHWEST
HIGH SCHOOL.

09:11.180 --> 09:13.239
PULL UP THE DISTRICT
THAT SERVES
NORTHWEST HIGH.

09:13.280 --> 09:15.111
ARE THERE
ANY PRIVATE SCHOOLS

09:15.150 --> 09:17.289
WITHIN THCIJSI-IT B’OUNDARIES?

09:17.320 --> 09:20.312
DO ANY OF THEM OFFER
ELECT IVE COURSES
AT GEORGETOWN?

09:20.360 --> 09:21.918
ONE. THE MORTON SCHOOL.

09:21.960 --> 09:23.587
PULL UP
THE JUNIOR CLASS.

09:23.630 --> 09:24.949
AH!
UH, SOPHOMORE CLASS.

09:24.990 --> 09:26.924
AH, IF I DO SAY SO MYSELF.

09:26.960 --> 09:28.621
WAIT, WAIT. STOP.

09:31.370 --> 09:33.235
NATHAN HARRIS.

09:33.270 --> 09:33.793
WE GOT HIM.

09:41.780 --> 09:42.849
* OOH

09:42.880 --> 09:44.905
* OOH, OOH OOH OOH

09:44.950 --> 09:46.918
* I GET YOU HERE...

09:46.950 --> 09:48.838
I'LL BE
RIGHT THERE.

09:48.880 --> 09:50.279
* OOH

09:50.320 --> 09:52.618
* OOH, OOH OOH OOH...

09:52.660 --> 09:54.912
I'M JASON GIDEON
WITH THE FBI.

09:54.960 --> 09:56.052
DR. REID. AGENT MORGAN.

09:56.090 --> 09:57.819
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
YOUR SON NATHAN.

09:57.860 --> 09:58.656
WHY?

09:58.690 --> 10:00.191
WE JUST WANNA ASK HIM
SOME QUESTIONS.

10:00.230 --> 10:02.357
WELL, NOT UNTIL YOU
EXPLAIN WHAT'S GOING ON.

10:02.400 --> 10:05.392
UH, YOUR SON CAME TO TALK
TO ME THIS MORNING
ABOUT A MURDER CASE.

10:05.430 --> 10:08.399
WHY WOULD NATHAN
KNOW ANYTHING
ABOUT A MURDER?

10:08.440 --> 10:12.308
NO, MOM, IT'S TRUE.
I--I DID TALK TO HIM.

10:12.340 --> 10:14.171
* I'M JUST 19

10:14.210 --> 10:16.974
DO YOU MIND IF
I SPEAK TO HIM ALONE?

10:17.010 --> 10:19.342
WE'LL STAY
OUT HERE, MA'AM.

10:19.380 --> 10:20.210
O-OK.

10:20.250 --> 10:23.185
* I'M JUST 19

10:23.720 --> 10:25.278
* OHH

10:25.320 --> 10:28.153
* H00 H00

10:29.860 --> 10:30.827
* YOU KNOW I--

10:30.860 --> 10:33.328
I KNEW IF YOU
WERE REALLY GOOD,
YOU'D FIND ME.

10:33.360 --> 10:36.193
IS THAT WHY YOU
WERE WAITING FOR ME?

10:36.230 --> 10:37.390
YOU--YOU WANTED
TO GET CAUGHT?

10:37.430 --> 10:40.160
WHAT DO YOU MEAN,
"GET CAUGHT"?

10:40.200 --> 10:41.360
OH--
HEY.

10:41.400 --> 10:44.961
STAY RIGHT THERE
AND KEEP YOUR HANDS
WHERE I CAN SEE THEM.

10:45.010 --> 10:48.104
IT'S JUST THE TEXT
FOR A GRAPHIC NOVEL.

10:48.140 --> 10:49.334
ABOUT KILLING
PROSTITUTES?

10:49.380 --> 10:52.042
YEAH, JACK THE RIPPER.
IT'S A FAMOUS CASE.

10:52.080 --> 10:53.877
THIS ISN'T A GAME, KID.

10:53.920 --> 10:54.477
I KNOW.

10:54.520 --> 10:55.418
YOU KNEW SPECIFIC DETAILS

10:55.450 --> 10:58.385
ABOUT A MURDER THAT
HASN'T BEEN PUBLICIZED.

10:58.420 --> 11:00.980
BUT I DIDN'T KILL HER.

11:01.020 --> 11:03.284
I JUST...

11:03.330 --> 11:05.651
I REALLY WANTED TO.

11:19.780 --> 11:21.475
NATHAN, IF YOU DIDN'T DO IT,

11:21.510 --> 11:24.172
HOW'D YOU KNOW
THE DETAILS OF THE MURDER?

11:24.210 --> 11:27.179
'CAUSE I SAW THE BODY.
IT WAS EARLY.

11:27.220 --> 11:28.369
IT WAS BEFORE SCHOOL.

11:28.420 --> 11:29.569
SHE--SHE WAS
DRESSED IN RED.

11:29.620 --> 11:34.057
SHE'D BEEN STABBED
A LOT, AND HER HAIR
WAS ALL CHOPPED OFF.

11:34.090 --> 11:34.749
WHERE WAS THAT?

11:34.790 --> 11:36.382
IN AN ALLEY
OFF OF "K" STREET.

11:36.420 --> 11:37.978
THEY TAKE MEN
DOWN THERE FOR SEX.

11:38.030 --> 11:40.055
I SEE 'EM DO IT
ALL THE TIME.

11:40.100 --> 11:41.158
WHAT WERE YOU DOING
DOWN THERE?

11:41.200 --> 11:43.725
I DON'T KNOW.
I JUST SORT OF...

11:43.770 --> 11:45.260
END UP THERE
SOMETIMES, YOU KNOW?

11:45.300 --> 11:46.995
I--I STAY OUT
ALL NIGHT,

11:47.040 --> 11:49.099
AND I JUST COME BACK
IN THE MORNING,

11:49.140 --> 11:53.873
AND IF MY MOM'S AT WORK,
I DON'T EVEN BOTHER
COMING HOME.

11:53.910 --> 11:54.604
THINKING
DARK THOUGHTS

11:54.640 --> 11:57.768
IS A FAR CRY
FROM BEING A DANGER.

11:57.810 --> 11:59.072
I KNOW THAT.

11:59.110 --> 12:02.785
I DON'T THINK ANYONE'S
PERSONAL DEMONS WOULD
HOLD UP TO SCRUTINY.

12:02.820 --> 12:04.811
MINE WOULDN'T.
WOULD YOURS?

12:04.850 --> 12:05.782
NO.

12:05.820 --> 12:07.253
HE'S A GOOD BOY.

12:07.290 --> 12:08.257
HE'S EXCEPTIONALLY
BRIGHT.

12:08.290 --> 12:11.521
HE JUST LIVES
IN HIS HEAD MORE
THAN OTHER KIDS.

12:11.560 --> 12:13.391
SO IT'S JUST
THE TWO OF YOU?

12:13.430 --> 12:16.149
HIS FATHER DIED
WHEN HE WAS 9.

12:16.200 --> 12:17.326
HOW'D HE HANDLE THAT?

12:17.370 --> 12:19.497
WELL, EMOTIONALLY
IT WAS GRUELING,

12:19.530 --> 12:21.964
BUT WE GOT THROUGH IT
TOGETHER.

12:22.000 --> 12:23.501
AND YOU'RE CLOSE.

12:23.540 --> 12:26.065
HMM. I'D SAY VERY.

12:26.110 --> 12:27.805
DON'T GO
MISINTERPRETING THAT.

12:27.840 --> 12:29.330
YOU TEACH
AT G.W. MEDICAL SCHOOL,

12:29.380 --> 12:32.008
YOU'RE ALSO ON CALL
AT THE HOSPITAL?

12:32.050 --> 12:32.846
2 WEEKS A MONTH.

12:32.880 --> 12:35.872
SO NATHAN MUST HAVE
A LOT OF FREEDOM.

12:35.920 --> 12:36.909
I TREAT HIM LIKE A MAN,

12:36.950 --> 12:39.180
BECAUSE
HE'S ALWAYS HANDLED
HIS RESPONSIBILITY.

12:39.220 --> 12:42.314
WHY DIDN'T YOU
CALL THE POLICE?

12:42.360 --> 12:44.282
I DON'T KNOW.

12:44.330 --> 12:48.198
NATHAN, THE PROSTITUTES
I TALKED TO SAY
YOU WATCH THEM.

12:48.230 --> 12:49.094
I'D NEVER
TOUCH THEM.

12:49.130 --> 12:51.564
YOU FANTASIZE ABOUT
HAVING SEX WITH THEM?

12:51.600 --> 12:55.866
NO, I TOLD YOU, I THINK
ABOUT KILLING THEM.

12:56.100 --> 12:58.864
LOOK,
AFTER THE LECTURE,

12:58.910 --> 13:01.299
I SAW YOU
AT THE METRO STOP
A FEW TIMES,

13:01.340 --> 13:04.047
AND I THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU COULD HELP ME.

13:04.080 --> 13:05.377
HOW?
I DON'T KNOW.

13:05.410 --> 13:08.311
I SAW THAT BODY,
AND I FELT EXCITED,

13:08.350 --> 13:09.510
AND THAT
REALLY SCARED ME.

13:09.550 --> 13:11.586
IS IT POSSIBLE THAT YOU
ACTUALLY KILLED
THOSE PROSTITUTES,

13:11.620 --> 13:14.851
BUT YOU JUST DON'T
WANT TO ADMIT IT
TO YOURSELF?

13:14.890 --> 13:15.857
NO.

13:15.890 --> 13:17.426
THEN WHY'D YOU
RUN AWAY FROM ME?

13:17.460 --> 13:20.054
'CAUSE I DON'T KNOW,
BUT I THOUGHT YOU'D SAY

13:20.100 --> 13:24.218
I WAS CRAZY AND THERE
WAS NO WAY TO STOP IT.

13:27.940 --> 13:28.565
THANK YOU.

13:28.600 --> 13:30.363
SURE.

13:31.370 --> 13:32.667
ARE YOU
ARRESTING HIM?

13:32.710 --> 13:36.373
MA'AM, WE'D LIKE TO LET
THE JUVENILE AUTHORITIES
HOLD HIM OVERNIGHT

13:36.410 --> 13:38.549
SO WE CAN DO
A PSYCHOLOGICAL EVALUATION.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.343
I CAN'T BELIEVE
THIS IS REAL.

13:40.380 --> 13:42.314
WELL, RIGHT NOW
IT'S JUST
AN EVALUATION.

13:42.350 --> 13:44.443
I'D ENCOURAGE
NATHAN TO HAVE
A LAWYER PRESENT.

13:44.490 --> 13:47.516
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
HE'S GOING THROUGH,

13:47.560 --> 13:49.380
BUT THE NATHAN I KNOW
IS A SWEET BOY.

13:49.420 --> 13:50.626
I BELIEVE YOU.

13:50.660 --> 13:53.857
DO WE HAVE
YOUR PERMISSION?

13:53.900 --> 13:57.563
I'LL SHOW YOU WHERE
TO SIGN THE PAPERWORK.

13:58.300 --> 14:01.599
THE JUVENILE AUTHORITIES
ARE WAITING FOR
NATHAN HARRIS.

14:01.640 --> 14:02.595
HE'S IN INTERROGATION.

14:02.640 --> 14:04.631
IS HE OUR UNSUB?

14:04.670 --> 14:05.602
I DON'T KNOW.

14:05.640 --> 14:07.437
HE SAYS
HE DIDN'T DO IT.

14:07.480 --> 14:08.936
HE ACTUALLY
SEEMS SINCERE.

14:08.980 --> 14:10.607
BUT HE'S A SMART KID,

14:10.650 --> 14:12.242
AND PART OF THE
SEXUAL-SADIST PROFILE

14:12.280 --> 14:15.511
IS THE ABILITY TO MIMIC
HONESTY AND SINCERITY.

15:04.000 --> 15:06.992
THE POLICE
ARE HERE FOR YOU.

15:07.300 --> 15:08.961
DR. REID.

15:09.000 --> 15:09.830
YEAH?

15:09.870 --> 15:12.338
I KNOW I, UM,
DON'T DESERVE ANY FAVORS,

15:12.370 --> 15:15.703
BUT WHATEVER
MY PSYCH EVAL SAYS,

15:15.740 --> 15:19.608
YOU PROMISE
YOU'LL TELL ME THE TRUTH?

15:19.650 --> 15:22.016
UM, MY MOM SAYS
A PROMISE DOESN'T COUNT

15:22.050 --> 15:24.518
UNLESS YOU SAY IT
OUT LOUD.

15:25.590 --> 15:27.114
I PROMISE.

15:27.560 --> 15:29.949
OK. THANK YOU.

15:31.260 --> 15:33.592
YOU KNOW, HE MIGHT
HAVE KILLED 2 WOMEN.

15:33.630 --> 15:36.451
IT'S NOT YOUR JOB
TO HOLD HIS HAND
THROUGH THIS.

15:36.500 --> 15:37.467
IT'S LIKE WITH MY MOM.

15:37.500 --> 15:40.196
I USED TO THINK THAT IF
I COULD JUST UNDERSTAND

15:40.240 --> 15:42.629
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING
THERE IS TO KNOW
ABOUT SCHIZOPHRENIA,

15:42.670 --> 15:47.437
THEN I'D SOMEHOW
BE ABLE TO FIX IT.

15:47.480 --> 15:49.300
YOU CAN'T.

15:49.340 --> 15:50.307
GUYS.

15:50.350 --> 15:51.169
I'M SORRY.

15:51.210 --> 15:52.370
I NEED EVERYBODY
IN THE CONFERENCE ROOM.

15:52.410 --> 15:57.245
IF NATHAN HARRIS
ISN'T OUR UNSUB,
WE NEED A WORKING PROFILE.

16:03.060 --> 16:06.279
D.C. POLICE
SENT US THESE PHOTOS
OF THE FIRST VICTIM.

16:06.330 --> 16:08.150
THIS WAS THE UNSUB'S
FIRST KILL.

16:08.200 --> 16:10.065
HE HELD HIS URGES
IN CHECK FOR 3 MONTHS,

16:10.100 --> 16:11.988
AND WHEN HE COULDN'T
CONTROL THEM ANY MORE,

16:12.030 --> 16:13.429
HE SENT THIS MESSAGE
TO THE COPS.

16:13.470 --> 16:15.335
WE KNOW THE "HELP"
AND THE HESITATION MARKS

16:15.370 --> 16:16.689
MEAN HE WAS AMBIVALENT
ABOUT THE KILL.

16:16.740 --> 16:18.731
WHAT WE DON'T KNOW IS
WHY HE CHOPPED THE HAIR.

16:18.770 --> 16:21.477
HE DIDN'T TAKE IT WITH HIM.
WE KNOW IT'S NOT A TROPHY.

16:21.510 --> 16:24.070
IT'S PROBABLY A WAY
TO MINIMIZE SOME
OF THEIR POWER,

16:24.110 --> 16:25.145
ROBS THEM OF
THEIR FEMININITY.

16:25.180 --> 16:27.171
THAT FITS WITH HIM
KILLING DURING
THE EARLY MORNING.

16:27.220 --> 16:29.313
IT'S THE TIME WHEN
PROSTITUTES HAVE THE
LEAST POWER SEXUALLY,

16:29.350 --> 16:32.387
AS OPPOSED TO AT NIGHT,
WHEN HE MIGHT SEE THEM
AS BEING ON THE PROWL.

16:32.420 --> 16:35.150
HEY, I KNOW WE'RE
JUST SPITBALLING THIS HERE,

16:35.190 --> 16:37.226
BUT THIS PROFILE
POINTS TO NATHAN HARRIS.

16:37.260 --> 16:39.728
I DON'T WAN NA TALK
ABOUT NATHAN HARRIS.

16:39.760 --> 16:43.218
HOTCH, SHE IS RIGHT.
HE REACHED OUT FOR HELP.

16:43.270 --> 16:44.669
THIS IS
AN ADOLESCENT KID.

16:44.700 --> 16:45.724
HE'S PROBABLY
INTIMIDATED SEXUALLY.

16:45.770 --> 16:48.034
I DON'T CARE
HOW MANY TIMES
HE SAYS HE DIDN'T DO IT.

16:48.070 --> 16:49.094
HE KNEW ABOUT
THE LAST VICTIM,

16:49.140 --> 16:51.108
AND HE ADMITTED
TO GETTING OFF
ON SEEING HER DEAD.

16:51.140 --> 16:52.107
WE'VE GOT
NATHAN HARRIS.

16:52.140 --> 16:54.028
IT DOESN'T DO US ANY GOOD
TO TALK ABOUT HIM NOW.

16:54.080 --> 16:55.604
I JUST WANNA MAKE SURE
THAT IF IT'S NOT HIM,

16:55.640 --> 16:58.803
WE STAY ON TOP OF THING
BEFORE IT TAKES ON
A LIFE OF ITS OWN.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.374
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
ALL RIGHT.

17:00.420 --> 17:01.614
WE KNOW OUR UNSUB
IS A SEXUAL SADIST.

17:01.650 --> 17:04.483
THE SYMBOLISM
OF STABBING THEM PROBABLY
MEANS HE'S IMPOTENT.

17:04.520 --> 17:06.715
THE ONLY WAY
HE CAN GET OFF
IS BY KILLING.

17:06.750 --> 17:07.751
CONSIDERING THAT
CUTTING THEIR HAIR

17:07.790 --> 17:09.781
AND KILLING DURING
THE EARLY MORNING

17:09.820 --> 17:10.855
BOTH STEM FROM
FEELING POWERLESS,

17:10.890 --> 17:13.757
THERE'S A CHANCE
HIS PATHOLOGY'S
MORE THAN SEXUAL.

17:13.800 --> 17:14.789
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

17:14.830 --> 17:16.718
THIS IS D.C.
POWER'S THE MOST
IMPORTANT COMMODITY.

17:16.760 --> 17:18.091
MAYBE THIS GUY
FEELS IMPOTENT

17:18.130 --> 17:19.768
IN HIS
PROFESSIONAL LIFE
AS WELL.

17:19.800 --> 17:20.767
BUT WHY THESE
PARTICULAR WOMEN?

17:20.800 --> 17:22.734
SIMPLEST ANSWER
IS THAT HE HAS ACCESS.

17:22.770 --> 17:27.070
WELL, NORTHWEST D.C.
HAS 3 MAJOR HUBS
OF PROSTITUTION--

17:27.110 --> 17:31.479
NEAR FLORIDA AVENUE;
OFF LOGAN CIRCLE;
AND MCPHERSON SQUARE,

17:31.510 --> 17:33.114
WHERE THE VICTIMS
WERE FOUND.

17:33.150 --> 17:34.344
PROBABLY WORKS
IN OR AROUND
CAPITOL HILL.

17:34.380 --> 17:37.213
WELL, I'LL GO
BACK OUT ON THE STREET
IN THE MORNING

17:37.250 --> 17:41.380
AND SEE IF ANY OF THESE
WOMEN KNOW SOMEONE WHO
FITS THAT DESCRIPTION.

17:41.420 --> 17:41.988
GOOD.

17:42.020 --> 17:42.918
IT'S LATE.
LET'S GO HOME.

17:42.960 --> 17:46.623
UM, SHOULDN'T WE
GET WORD OUT
TO THE PAPERS?

17:46.660 --> 17:47.228
NOT YET.

17:47.260 --> 17:48.727
WELL,
IT'S NOT TOO LATE

17:48.760 --> 17:50.261
TO MAKE
THE MORNING EDITION.

17:50.300 --> 17:52.097
I SAID NO.

17:58.840 --> 18:00.171
HEY!

18:00.210 --> 18:02.428
YOU SEEN LITTLE HOLLY?

18:45.850 --> 18:48.318
IT SAYS, "FAILURE."

18:53.900 --> 18:56.323
SHE WAS ONLY 16.

18:57.370 --> 18:58.428
HE'S GETTING ANGRIER

18:58.470 --> 19:00.165
AND BLAMING THE POLICE
FOR NOT STOPPING
HIS IMPULSES.

19:00.200 --> 19:02.930
CERTAINLY NOT
COOLING OFF BETWEEN
KILLS ANYMORE.

19:02.970 --> 19:05.859
WHICH MEANS WE'RE LOOKING
AT A WHOLE LOT OF BODIES.

19:05.910 --> 19:07.775
MEANWHILE IN 2 DAYS,
CONGRESSWOMAN STEYER'S

19:07.810 --> 19:08.538
GONNA STAND UP
AT THE CAPITOL

19:08.580 --> 19:09.672
AND DECLARE WASHINGTON
CRIME-FREE.

19:09.710 --> 19:13.578
HEY, WHAT
DID SHE WANT WITH YOU
THE OTHER DAY, ANYWAY?

19:13.620 --> 19:15.679
IT WAS A PRIVATE
CONVERSATION.

19:15.720 --> 19:18.848
RIGHT. OF COURSE.
I'M SORRY.

19:18.890 --> 19:21.757
WELL, I GUESS WE
KNOW NATHAN HARRIS
ISN'T OUR UNSUB.

19:21.790 --> 19:24.486
SHOULD WE CALL GIDEON
AND TELL HIM NOT TO BOTHER
WITH THE EVAL?

19:24.530 --> 19:27.658
NO, HE WANTS TO UNDERSTAND
WHAT'S HAPPENING TO HIM.

19:27.700 --> 19:29.520
HE DESERVES TO KNOW.

19:38.740 --> 19:40.469
DOES HE HAVE TO BE HERE?

19:40.510 --> 19:41.636
IT'S FOR
YOUR OWN PROTECTION.

19:41.680 --> 19:45.844
HE'S HERE TO MAKE SURE
WE'RE NOT TALKING
ABOUT THE CASE,

19:45.880 --> 19:47.438
JUST ABOUT YOU.

19:47.480 --> 19:49.869
SO I DON'T WET THE BED
OR START FIRES.

19:49.920 --> 19:54.948
HEH. I SEE YOU'VE
READ DR. HARRIS' WARNING
SIGNS OF PSYCHOPATHY.

19:54.990 --> 19:56.810
YEAH. IS THAT WRONG?

19:56.860 --> 19:57.519
NO, IT'S HEALTHY.

19:57.560 --> 19:58.424
YOU'RE
INTELLECTUALLY CURIOUS.

19:58.460 --> 20:01.497
YOU WANNA UNDERSTAND
HOW YOU'RE FEELING.

20:01.530 --> 20:04.260
SO YOU DON'T WET THE BED
OR START FIRES.

20:04.300 --> 20:06.495
TELL ME WHAT WORRIES YOU.

20:06.530 --> 20:10.307
I'VE JUST BEEN, UM...

20:11.540 --> 20:12.962
THINKING ABOUT STUFF.

20:13.010 --> 20:16.275
ABOUT HURTING WOMEN?

20:16.940 --> 20:18.009
YEAH.

20:18.050 --> 20:20.917
HAVE YOU EVER
HURT ANYONE?

20:21.820 --> 20:22.775
I KILLED A BIRD ONCE.

20:22.820 --> 20:26.938
I KNOW THAT'S ON THE LIST.
IT'S ONE OF THE SIGNS.

20:26.990 --> 20:29.686
WHY'D YOU KILL THE BIRD?

20:30.390 --> 20:33.450
'CAUSE I WAS SAD.

20:33.500 --> 20:35.354
HOW'D YOU FEEL
AFTERWARDS?

20:35.400 --> 20:38.028
BETTER.

20:38.070 --> 20:39.924
WHY?

20:42.300 --> 20:43.631
I DON'T KNOW, 'CAUSE...

20:43.670 --> 20:46.309
IT WAS DEAD,
AND I WAS STILL ALIVE.

20:46.340 --> 20:48.979
IS THAT WHY
YOU WANNA HURT WOMEN,

20:49.010 --> 20:50.978
TO FEEL BETTER?

20:51.650 --> 20:53.914
I DON'T KNOW.

20:53.950 --> 20:57.249
HAVE YOU EVER
SEEN A WOMAN NAKED?

20:57.920 --> 21:00.013
DON'T WORRY
ABOUT HIM.

21:00.050 --> 21:01.358
NO OFFENSE.

21:01.390 --> 21:02.982
NONE TAKEN.

21:03.020 --> 21:04.988
UM...

21:05.030 --> 21:05.951
A FEW YEARS AGO.

21:05.990 --> 21:08.993
MY MOM'S MED SCHOOL,
HER STUDENTS GET CADAVERS.

21:09.030 --> 21:11.328
SO HOW'D THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

21:11.370 --> 21:15.033
GOOD. EXCITED.

21:15.070 --> 21:16.264
AND SICK.

21:16.300 --> 21:19.963
PERFECT LY NATURAL,
BOY TO FEEL EXCITED,
HE SEES A NAKED BODY,

21:20.010 --> 21:21.102
EVEN A CADAVER.

21:21.140 --> 21:24.746
YEAH, BUT NOW
THAT'S THE ONLY PART
THAT I THINK ABOUT.

21:24.780 --> 21:26.008
WHICH PART?

21:26.050 --> 21:27.608
THEM BEING DEAD.

21:27.650 --> 21:28.947
SO WHEN YOU WATCH
THE PROSTITUTES,

21:28.980 --> 21:31.847
YOU DON'T IMAGINE
HAVING SEX WITH THEM?

21:32.520 --> 21:35.683
NO, I THINK ABOUT
CUTTING THEM.

21:36.360 --> 21:37.782
WHY?

21:38.930 --> 21:40.488
I DON'T KNOW,

21:40.530 --> 21:41.690
MAYBE TO LOOK INSIDE.

21:41.730 --> 21:46.463
OR SOMETIMES
I THINK ABOUT FEELING
THEIR BLOOD IN MY HANDS

21:46.500 --> 21:49.333
AND FEELING IT FLOW
THROUGH MY FINGERS.

21:49.370 --> 21:51.668
DOES THAT EVER
MAKE YOU CLIMAX,

21:51.710 --> 21:54.338
JUST BY THINKING
OF THAT?

21:57.510 --> 22:00.411
I KNOW I'M CRAZY.

22:01.020 --> 22:03.045
DID I SAY THAT?

22:04.390 --> 22:05.687
NO, BUT...

22:05.720 --> 22:10.987
WHAT DO YOU CALL
PICTURES IN YOUR HEAD
THAT YOU CAN'T MAKE GO AWAY?

22:24.410 --> 22:25.069
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

22:25.110 --> 22:29.035
STAY HERE.
I'LL BE RIGHT BACK.

22:32.680 --> 22:36.047
IT'S MY OPINION
THAT NATHAN SHOULD
BE HOSPITALIZED.

22:36.080 --> 22:37.012
WHAT?

22:37.050 --> 22:39.416
I THINK
HE NEEDS FULL-TIME
MEDICAL ATTENTION.

22:39.450 --> 22:40.144
I'M A DOCTOR.

22:40.190 --> 22:41.350
HE'S HAVING
HOMICIDAL FANTASIES

22:41.390 --> 22:44.951
THAT ARE DIRECTLY LINKED
TO HIS SEXUAL IMPULSES
AND RELEASE.

22:44.990 --> 22:46.423
WELL, HE CAME
TO YOUR AGENT.

22:46.460 --> 22:47.358
THAT SHOWS
THAT HE'S CONCERNED.

22:47.400 --> 22:49.857
IN HIS HEART, HE DOESN'T
WANT TO HURT ANYONE.

22:49.900 --> 22:50.559
POSITIVE SIGN,

22:50.600 --> 22:51.498
BUT INTELLIGENCE
AND AWARENESS

22:51.530 --> 22:52.599
DON'T ALWAYS ALLOW US
TO CONTROL OUR URGES.

22:52.630 --> 22:53.938
ADMITTING THE PROBLEM
DOESN'T MEAN
YOU CAN MANAGE IT.

22:53.970 --> 22:58.998
IF I PUT HIM IN A HOSPITAL,
I'D BE TELLING HIM
THAT HE'S A MONSTER.

22:59.040 --> 23:00.064
NO, NO, NO, NO, NO.
HE'S JUST--

23:00.110 --> 23:02.101
RIGHT NOW HE'S SICK,
AND HE NEEDS HELP.

23:02.140 --> 23:03.107
NO.
IF AN ALCOHOLIC

23:03.140 --> 23:05.540
CANNOT CONTROL
HIS IMPULSES,
MA'AM, HE DRINKS.

23:05.580 --> 23:07.411
YOU NEED TO CONSIDER
WHAT HAPPENS

23:07.450 --> 23:08.371
WITH SOMEONE FIGHTING
PSYCHOTIC URGES.

23:08.420 --> 23:10.911
I'M NOT NAIVE.
I'M NOT GONNA TURN A BLIND EYE,

23:10.950 --> 23:12.440
BUT I HAVE
TO PROTECT MY SON.

23:12.490 --> 23:13.912
HE NEEDS TO BE
WITH PROFESSIONALS.

23:13.960 --> 23:15.552
I HAVE ACCESS
TO THE BEST IN WASHINGTON.

23:15.590 --> 23:18.457
I'LL MAKE SURE THAT HE
SEES SOMEONE EVERY SINGLE DAY,

23:18.490 --> 23:21.391
BUT I AM NOT
GONNA LOCK HIM AWAY.

23:31.210 --> 23:32.905
HAVE A SEAT.

23:37.710 --> 23:39.905
I DON'T APPRECIATE
BEING QUESTIONED

23:39.950 --> 23:40.974
IN FRONT OF
OTHER AGENTS.

23:41.020 --> 23:42.317
IT WAS NOT MY INTENTION.
I'M SORRY.

23:42.350 --> 23:46.446
WHAT WERE YOU TALKING
TO CONGRESSWOMAN STEYER
ABOUT THE OTHER DAY?

23:46.490 --> 23:47.718
SHE STOPPED BY
TO SAY HELLO.

23:47.760 --> 23:50.524
SHE WORKED WITH MY MOTHER,
SO I'VE KNOWN HER
SINCE I WAS A KID.

23:50.560 --> 23:52.858
DID YOU TIP HER OFF
ABOUT THIS CASE?

23:52.890 --> 23:53.424
NO.

23:53.460 --> 23:54.199
THIS TEAM CAN'T FUNCTION

23:54.230 --> 23:56.448
IF I DON'T TRUST
THE PEOPLE ON IT.

23:56.500 --> 24:00.869
SIR, IF I TOUCHED A NERVE
OUT THERE TODAY, I'M SORRY,

24:00.900 --> 24:02.231
BUT I DON'T DESERVE THIS.

24:02.270 --> 24:04.534
YOU MYSTERIOUSLY
SHOWED UP AT THE BAU

24:04.570 --> 24:07.733
AFTER ONE OF MY TEAM
MEMBERS WAS INVOLVED IN
A QUESTIONABLE SHOOTING.

24:07.780 --> 24:09.179
RIGHT.
YOU'VE DONE GOOD WORK.

24:09.210 --> 24:11.144
I'M NOT
QUESTIONING THAT.

24:11.180 --> 24:15.173
BUT I WILL NOT PUT UP
WITH A POLITICAL AGENDA.

24:18.850 --> 24:20.613
MY MOTHER'S
A CAREER POLITICIAN.

24:20.660 --> 24:23.220
YOU WORKED WITH HER.
DID YOU LIKE HER?

24:23.260 --> 24:25.524
SHE'S
AN IMPRESSIVE WOMEN.

24:26.930 --> 24:31.264
WELL, I THINK POLITICS
MAKES PEOPLE DISTRUSTFUL.

24:31.300 --> 24:34.497
I THINK IT MAKES THEM
HATE THEMSELVES.

24:34.540 --> 24:40.228
I THINK IT TEARS FAMILIES APART
AND DAMAGES PEOPLE.

24:41.180 --> 24:42.033
SO IF THERE'S NOTHING ELSE,

24:42.080 --> 24:44.048
I WOULD LIKE TO GET BACK
OUT ON THE STREET

24:44.080 --> 24:46.674
AND FIND OUT
WHO'S KILLING THESE WOMEN.

24:48.050 --> 24:50.211
SIR.

25:00.260 --> 25:03.024
HAVE YOU REACHED
A CONCLUSION ABOUT
NATHAN HARRIS YET?

25:03.060 --> 25:06.223
PROFILES AND EVALUATIONS
ARE AN INEXACT SCIENCE.

25:06.270 --> 25:09.296
BUT YOUR
PROFESSIONAL OPINION?

25:09.340 --> 25:13.538
NOT A QUESTION OF WHETHER
HE ENDS UP KILLING SOMEONE.

25:13.580 --> 25:15.002
IT'S WHEN.

25:26.290 --> 25:29.589
NATHAN .

25:31.130 --> 25:32.927
NATHAN, HONEY.

25:38.670 --> 25:40.297
NATHAN .

25:51.280 --> 25:53.305
OH, MY GOD.

25:55.680 --> 25:58.217
HE'S GOTTA
BE OUT HERE, RIGHT?

25:58.250 --> 25:58.989
WHERE ELSE WOULD HE BE?

25:59.020 --> 26:00.954
I STILL CAN'T
BELIEVE HIS MOTHER'S

26:00.990 --> 26:02.116
NOT OUT HERE
SEARCHING FOR HIM.

26:02.160 --> 26:06.028
I TOLD HER IT'D
BE BETTER IF SHE WAITED
FOR HIM AT HOME.

26:06.060 --> 26:09.757
REID, YOU KNOW THIS IS
NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY.

26:09.800 --> 26:10.767
IT IS.

26:10.800 --> 26:12.324
I CAN'T EXPLAIN.

26:12.370 --> 26:13.962
WELL, TRY ME.

26:14.000 --> 26:15.797
HE KNOWS
I UNDERSTAND HIM.

26:15.840 --> 26:18.331
HEH. OF COURSE YOU DO.
YOU'RE A PROFILER.

26:18.370 --> 26:20.338
IT'S MORE THAN THAT.

26:20.370 --> 26:21.632
HOW?

26:21.680 --> 26:22.738
I KNOW
WHAT IT'S LIKE

26:22.780 --> 26:25.601
TO BE AFRAID
OF YOUR OWN MIND.

26:31.750 --> 26:33.809
HEH. WHAT'S UP
WITH HOTCH TODAY?

26:33.860 --> 26:35.054
I DON'T KNOW.

26:35.090 --> 26:38.856
MAYBE HE TIED THAT KNOT
IN HIS TIE A LITTLE
TOO TIGHT AGAIN.

26:40.830 --> 26:42.354
YEAH.

26:44.670 --> 26:45.398
OK.

26:45.430 --> 26:48.035
WE'RE ON OUR WAY.

26:48.970 --> 26:52.701
THEY JUST FOUND A BODY.

27:08.060 --> 27:11.257
I'D SAY HE'S
GETTING BOLDER.

27:12.230 --> 27:14.323
IF IT'S THE SAME UNSUB.

27:14.360 --> 27:16.248
THINK IT COULD'VE
BEEN NATHAN?

27:16.300 --> 27:18.894
THIS KILL WAS
FAST AND MESSY.

27:18.930 --> 27:20.397
THERE'S NO CUT HAIR,

27:20.430 --> 27:21.362
NO MESSAGE CARVED.

27:21.400 --> 27:23.664
NOT TO MENTION
KILLING AT NIGHT.

27:23.710 --> 27:26.736
NONE OF IT'S
OUR UNSUB'S SIGNATURE.

27:26.770 --> 27:27.566
EXCUSE ME, AGENT.

27:27.610 --> 27:29.976
THEY FOUND THE BOY
YOU'RE LOOKING FOR.

27:36.250 --> 27:39.879
SAYS HE'S
BEEN HERE 4 HOURS.

27:46.460 --> 27:49.190
GOT A LOT OF PEOPLE
WORRIED.

27:49.230 --> 27:50.219
SORRY.

27:50.260 --> 27:55.664
TOLD THAT POLICEMAN
THAT YOU'VE BEEN HERE 4 HOURS?

27:57.170 --> 27:59.764
I SNUCK OUT,
AND I STARTED WALKING,

27:59.810 --> 28:02.301
LIKE I COULDN'T
CONTROL IT, SO...

28:02.340 --> 28:05.844
I FIGURED I'D COME HERE
AND TRY AND FIGHT IT.

28:05.880 --> 28:08.212
HAS ANYBODY
SEEN YOU HERE?

28:09.180 --> 28:10.909
DOESN'T MATTER, ANYWAY.

28:10.950 --> 28:12.747
IT DOES MATTER, NATHAN.

28:12.790 --> 28:17.386
A WOMAN WAS STABBED TONIGHT,
AND NOBODY SAW YOU.

28:17.420 --> 28:21.720
I'M GONNA HAVE TO
BRING YOU IN AS A SUSPECT.

28:21.760 --> 28:24.320
YOU GONNA CUFF ME?

28:34.810 --> 28:36.300
LET'S GO.

28:36.340 --> 28:39.901
DO YOU WANNA KNOW
WHAT I'VE BEEN
DOING ALL NIGHT?

28:39.950 --> 28:41.747
HMM?

28:41.780 --> 28:44.783
JUST BEEN SITTING HERE,
THINKING

28:44.820 --> 28:50.452
THE ONLY WAY FOR ME
TO SAVE PEOPLE'S LIVES
IN THE FUTURE

28:50.490 --> 28:54.221
IS TO KILL MYSELF.

29:01.800 --> 29:03.131
SO NATHAN'S IN CUSTODY?

29:03.170 --> 29:04.330
THEY'RE HOLDING HIM
DOWNTOWN.

29:04.370 --> 29:07.259
YOU REALLY THINK
HE KILLED THAT LAST WOMAN?

29:07.310 --> 29:08.436
IT'S POSSIBLE.

29:08.480 --> 29:09.208
BUT...

29:09.240 --> 29:10.844
NATHAN'S EVOLVING.
THIS LAST KILL,

29:10.880 --> 29:11.904
IT FEELS LIKE
A DEVOLUTION.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.874
IT WAS SLOPPY AND ANGRY.
NATHAN'S SMART AND DIRECTED.

29:14.920 --> 29:17.343
HE'S USED TO ACHIEVING.
IF HE DECIDES TO KILL,

29:17.380 --> 29:18.540
IT'LL BE CLINICAL
AND EFFICIENT.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.546
SO WHERE DOES
THAT LEAVE US?

29:20.590 --> 29:21.557
BACK TO THE PROFILE.

29:21.590 --> 29:24.081
FIRST VICTIM,
HE GETS A TASTE FOR KILLING.

29:24.130 --> 29:26.325
SECOND, HE ASKS THE POLICE
TO HELP STOP HIM.

29:26.360 --> 29:28.828
BY THE THIRD, HE FEELS
LIKE THEY'VE FAILED HIM.

29:28.860 --> 29:30.350
HE'S ALREADY DEVOLVING.

29:30.400 --> 29:33.369
THE FOURTH, NO RITUAL,
NO MESSAGE,

29:33.400 --> 29:34.059
JUST A BRUTAL MURDER.

29:34.100 --> 29:35.533
IT'S TRUE THAT
HE'S DEVOLVING,

29:35.570 --> 29:37.834
BUT THIS LAST VICTIM
DEFINITELY HAD
A MESSAGE.

29:37.870 --> 29:38.802
YOU DON'T
DUMP A BODY

29:38.840 --> 29:40.808
ACROSS FROM
THE CAPITOL BUILDING
BY ACCIDENT.

29:40.840 --> 29:41.977
ESPECIALLY NOT
WHEN A CONGRESSWOMAN

29:42.010 --> 29:45.070
IS ABOUT TO PROCLAIM
SUCCESS AGAINST
THE CRIME EPIDEMIC.

29:45.110 --> 29:46.099
EXACTLY.

29:46.150 --> 29:47.208
GUYS, THAT PRESS CONFERENCE
WASN'T ANNOUNCED YET.

29:47.250 --> 29:50.469
ONLY SOMEONE WITH
INSIDE INFORMATION
WOULD KNOW THAT.

29:50.520 --> 29:52.317
WE PROFILED THE UNSUB
FELT LIMITED IN HIS JOB.

29:52.350 --> 29:55.581
WHAT'S MORE POWERLESS
THAN BEING A BIT PLAYER
ON THE WASHINGTON STAGE?

29:55.620 --> 29:57.383
YOU KNOW, IF HE FELT
LIKE HE DID HIS PART

29:57.420 --> 29:59.980
TO CLEAR THE PROSTITUTES
OFF THE STREET,
BUT WAS NEVER HEARD,

30:00.030 --> 30:01.327
HE MIGHT HAVE FELT
SO PERSONALLY BETRAYED

30:01.360 --> 30:04.022
THAT HE LITERALLY
HAD TO CARVE HIS FRUSTRATION OUT
ON THOSE WOMEN.

30:04.070 --> 30:05.059
SO THE PROFILE
WAS RIGHT.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.398
WE WERE JUST WRONG
ABOUT WHO THE MESSAGE
WAS FOR.

30:07.430 --> 30:08.863
WE NEED TO GET
A LIST OF ANYONE

30:08.900 --> 30:09.992
WHO ADVOCATED
ON BEHALF OF
THAT BILL.

30:10.040 --> 30:12.065
PRENTISS, WHEN YOU WENT BACK
TO TALK TO THE PROSTITUTES,

30:12.110 --> 30:14.101
DID A PROFILE RING A BELL
WITH ANY OF THEM?

30:14.140 --> 30:16.836
A FEW OF THEM
DESCRIBED WHAT SOUNDED
LIKE THE SAME MAN,

30:16.880 --> 30:19.041
BUT WHEN I SHOWED
THEM MUG SHOTS,
I CAME UP EMPTY.

30:19.080 --> 30:21.412
LET'S GO BACK TO THEM.
WE'RE GONNA NEED THEIR HELP.

30:21.450 --> 30:22.417
WHAT ARE YOU
THINKING ABOUT, HOTCH?

30:22.450 --> 30:24.509
I NEED TO GET A MESSAGE
TO CONGRESSWOMAN STEYER.

30:24.550 --> 30:26.916
HOW QUICKLY
CAN WE PUT TOGETHER
A PRESS CONFERENCE?

30:26.950 --> 30:28.315
HOW FAST
DO YOU NEED IT?

30:28.360 --> 30:30.282
MAY I HAVE
YOUR ATTENTION, PLEASE?

30:30.320 --> 30:32.880
A DAY FROM NOW,
THERE WILL BE AN ANNOUNCEMENT

30:32.930 --> 30:35.455
ACROSS THE STREET
ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL

30:35.500 --> 30:38.367
THAT CRIME IS DOWN
SIGNIFICANTLY IN WASHINGTON.

30:38.400 --> 30:39.469
THIS IS A FACT.

30:39.500 --> 30:41.559
IT IS ALSO A FACT HOWEVER,
THAT THERE'S A SERIAL KILLER

30:41.600 --> 30:44.034
WHO'S BEEN TARGETING
THE PROSTITUTES
WHO WORK IN THIS AREA.

30:44.070 --> 30:48.507
IN FACT, THE LAST VICTIM WAS
FOUND NOT A HUNDRED YARDS
FROM WHERE WE'RE STANDING.

30:48.540 --> 30:49.802
WE'RE HERE TODAY
TO LET YOU KNOW

30:49.840 --> 30:54.209
THAT THE POLICE
AND THE FBI ARE WORKING
TIRELESSLY ON THIS CASE.

30:54.250 --> 30:58.880
WE'D LIKE TO STRESS
TO THE WOMEN WHO
WORK ON THESE STREETS

30:58.920 --> 30:59.909
TO PLEASE TAKE CAUTION.

30:59.950 --> 31:01.884
ALL RIGHT, FIRST I'M GONNA
GIVE A BRIEF DESCRIPTION

31:01.920 --> 31:03.285
OF THE MAN
WE'RE LOOKING FOR,

31:03.320 --> 31:04.878
AND THEN WE'LL TAKE
SOME QUESTIONS.

31:04.930 --> 31:08.229
WE BELIEVE THE MAN
RESPONSIBLE FOR THESE CRIMES

31:08.260 --> 31:10.899
WORKS ON OR AROUND
CAPITOL HILL,

31:10.930 --> 31:13.319
POSSIBLY AT
A RESEARCH OR
ADVOCACY GROUP

31:13.370 --> 31:16.032
DEALING WITH ISSUES
OF CRIME CONTROL
OR PREVENTION.

31:16.070 --> 31:18.959
THE LOWER
THE GROUP IS ON THE WASHINGTON
FOOD CHAIN, THE BETTER.

31:19.010 --> 31:21.103
THIS GUY, HE FEELS LIKE
HIS VOICE ISN'T BEING HEARD,

31:21.140 --> 31:23.176
AND MAKE SURE TO CHECK
FOR ANY ADVOCACY GROUPS

31:23.210 --> 31:24.472
PROMOTING MORALITY
OR VALUES.

31:24.510 --> 31:25.499
OK, REALITY CHECK.

31:25.550 --> 31:27.142
WHAT YOU'RE
LOOKING FOR--NEEDLE.
THIS--HAYSTACK.

31:27.180 --> 31:28.670
GARCIA, WE DON'T
HAVE TO FIND IT.

31:28.720 --> 31:31.644
WE JUST NEED TO GET
TO THE PEOPLE WHO CAN.

31:31.690 --> 31:33.112
OK.

31:37.220 --> 31:39.927
YOU COULD'VE DONE THAT
MUCH MORE QUIETLY.

31:39.960 --> 31:40.881
I KNOW.

31:40.930 --> 31:44.127
THERE'S SOME PEOPLE
I'D LIKE FOR YOU TO MEET.

31:46.170 --> 31:48.934
RIGHT THIS WAY.

31:54.710 --> 31:55.904
JUST WHAT POINT
ARE YOU TRYING TO MAKE?

31:55.940 --> 31:59.478
THESE WOMEN DESCRIBED
SIMILAR EXPERIENCES
WITH THE SAME MAN.

31:59.510 --> 32:03.719
WE SHOWED THEM
POLICE MUG PHOTOS, AND THEY
DIDN'T RECOGNIZE HIM.

32:03.750 --> 32:06.082
WE THOUGHT MAYBE
YOU MIGHT KNOW WHO HE IS.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.519
DID YOU THINK
YOU COULD SHOCK ME

32:07.550 --> 32:09.154
BY TREATING ME
TO THIS SIDESHOW?

32:09.190 --> 32:09.986
SIDESHOW?

32:10.020 --> 32:11.681
LADY, ENOUGH OF
THE MEN YOU WORK WITH

32:11.730 --> 32:13.652
TREAT THEMSELVES TO US
EVERY DAY.

32:13.690 --> 32:14.998
MY APOLOGIES,
LADIES.

32:15.030 --> 32:18.727
COULD YOU PLEASE
TELL THE CONGRESSWOMAN WHO
IT IS WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

32:18.770 --> 32:21.034
HE'S TALL AND BALD,
AND HE'S GOT SAD EYES.

32:21.070 --> 32:24.005
HE WAS ALWAYS WEARING
A TURTLENECK WITH
THIS LONG, DARK COAT,

32:24.040 --> 32:25.029
LOOKED LIKE A MORTICIAN.

32:25.070 --> 32:27.004
THAT'S RIGHT. HUNG AROUND
JUST WATCHING FOR MONTHS

32:27.040 --> 32:29.099
BEFORE HE FINALLY
GOT HIS NERVE ON,

32:29.140 --> 32:30.971
BUT THEN HE JUST
WANTED TO WATCH.

32:31.010 --> 32:32.546
FREAK PAID ME
AND RACINE 200 BUCKS

32:32.580 --> 32:33.740
TO TURN EACH OTHER'S KNOBS,

32:33.780 --> 32:35.975
BUT THEN HE STARTED
SCREAMING AT US THAT
WE WERE LOW WOMEN.

32:36.020 --> 32:36.918
SAME THING WITH ME,
AND HIS VOICE

32:36.950 --> 32:40.181
GOT REAL HIGH AND NASAL
WHEN HE GOT EXCITED.

32:40.220 --> 32:43.018
DOES THAT SOUND
LIKE ANYONE
THAT YOU KNOW?

32:44.330 --> 32:45.058
NO.

32:45.090 --> 32:46.523
I'M GONNA READ YOU
A LIST OF GROUPS

32:46.560 --> 32:47.549
THAT LOBBIED ON BEHALF
OF YOUR LEGISLATION.

32:47.590 --> 32:49.126
KEEPING IN MIND
THE DESCRIPTION
YOU JUST HEARD,

32:49.160 --> 32:54.336
TELL ME IF ANYONE ASSOCIATED
WITH THESE GROUPS COULD BE
THE MAN WE'RE LOOKING FOR.

32:54.370 --> 32:56.190
UH, "THE CRIME
POLICY INSTITUTE,

32:56.240 --> 32:57.537
"THE CENTER FOR SAFETY,

32:57.570 --> 32:59.709
"CITIZENS' BRIGADE,

32:59.740 --> 33:01.378
DECENCY WATCH--"

33:01.410 --> 33:02.707
OH, MY GOD.

33:02.740 --> 33:03.775
DECENCY WATCH?

33:03.810 --> 33:05.402
THE MAN WHO RUNS IT.

33:05.450 --> 33:06.371
RONALD WEEMS.

33:06.410 --> 33:07.149
DO YOU KNOW HIM?

33:07.180 --> 33:09.546
NO. I MEAN, YES,
BUT HE'S A NOBODY.

33:09.580 --> 33:11.548
BUT HE FITS
THIS DESCRIPTION?

33:11.590 --> 33:14.309
PERFECT LY.

33:34.140 --> 33:37.075
I NEED TO GET
BACK TO WORK.

33:37.110 --> 33:39.044
AGAIN?

33:39.680 --> 33:42.649
YES, AGAIN.

33:44.820 --> 33:47.084
CAN'T BE HELPED.

34:10.580 --> 34:13.242
WE'RE LOOKING FOR
RONALD WEEMS.

34:13.750 --> 34:15.547
I-I'M SORRY.
YOU JUST MISSED HIM.

34:15.580 --> 34:18.583
WHY DON'T YOU COME BACK
IN A COUPLE HOURS?

34:18.620 --> 34:20.508
DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE?

34:20.550 --> 34:22.814
OF COURSE.
YES. I'M SORRY.

34:22.860 --> 34:26.352
WE'RE INVESTIGATING
THE MURDERS OF
LOCAL PROSTITUTES.

34:26.390 --> 34:29.120
I-I'M GLAD THAT RONALD
IS HELPING YOU WITH THAT,

34:29.160 --> 34:31.219
BUT I'M AFRAID I DON'T
KNOW ANYTHING ABOUT IT.

34:31.270 --> 34:34.489
WE'D JUST LIKE
TO TAKE A LOOK IN YOUR
HUSBAND'S OFFICE. PLEASE?

34:34.540 --> 34:38.408
RONALD DOESN'T ALLOW
ANYONE IN THERE. I'M SORRY.

34:38.440 --> 34:40.169
YOU REALLY
SHOULD COME BACK.

34:40.210 --> 34:41.438
IN THE LAST 6 MONTHS...

34:41.480 --> 34:46.577
DID YOUR HUSBAND
START ASKING YOU TO PLAY OUT
SEXUAL FANTASIES?

34:48.420 --> 34:49.375
EXCUSE ME?

34:49.420 --> 34:51.513
POSSIBLY EVEN
BERATED YOU IF YOU
PLAYED ALONG?

34:51.550 --> 34:52.744
I DON'T THINK
THAT'S APPROPRIATE.

34:52.790 --> 34:55.418
WHEN IT FINALLY STOPPED
ABOUT A MONTH AGO,
YOU WERE RELIEVED.

34:55.460 --> 34:58.452
MA'AM, YOU'RE AFRAID
TO ASK US WHY WE'RE HERE.

34:58.490 --> 35:00.355
NOW, IN YOUR HEART,
YOU KNOW WE'RE NOT HERE

35:00.390 --> 35:03.154
BECAUSE RONALD'S HELPING US
WITH THIS INVESTIGATION.

35:03.200 --> 35:04.360
GOOD NIGHT.

35:04.400 --> 35:06.891
YOU'VE BEEN GLAD
TO HAVE HIM LEAVE
THE HOUSE AT ODD HOURS,

35:06.930 --> 35:10.798
BECAUSE HE'S BEEN
ANGRY AND FRUSTRATED.

35:10.840 --> 35:16.335
WHEN HE COMES HOME,
HE FEELS LIKE THE MAN
YOU MARRIED AGAIN.

35:25.190 --> 35:29.115
HIS OFFICE. PLEASE.

35:39.930 --> 35:42.262
"WHY WON'T THEY
CLEAN THEM OFF THE STREET?

35:42.300 --> 35:43.460
"THE BLOOD IS
ON THEIR HANDS.

35:43.500 --> 35:45.536
"I SEE A WORLD SET FREE
OF VICE AND VERMIN,

35:45.570 --> 35:48.573
CLEANSED OF THE BLOOD
OF THE WHORES WHO
WALK THE STREET."

35:48.610 --> 35:50.407
DO YOU KNOW WHERE
YOUR HUSBAND WENT?

35:50.440 --> 35:53.807
HE SAID HE HAD
WORK TO DO.

36:08.900 --> 36:10.925
HEY, YOU EVER
SEEN THIS GUY,

36:10.960 --> 36:12.723
HUH, OUT HERE
DOING BUSINESS?

36:12.770 --> 36:14.328
CAN YOU TELL ME IF
YOU'VE SEEN THIS MAN?

36:14.370 --> 36:15.769
MA'AM, YOU EVER
SEEN THIS FACE?

36:15.800 --> 36:16.459
NO

36:16.500 --> 36:18.502
OUT HERE TALKING
TO THE LADIES?

36:18.540 --> 36:19.802
SORRY.

36:27.350 --> 36:29.568
YOU SEEN THIS GUY

36:29.620 --> 36:30.575
I AIN'T SEEN HIM.

36:30.620 --> 36:31.712
THANK YOU.
THAN KS.

36:31.750 --> 36:34.287
MY MAN, YOU EVER
SEEN THIS CAT OUT HERE
DOING BUSINESS?

36:34.320 --> 36:34.979
EXCUSE ME.

36:35.020 --> 36:39.525
YOU EVER SEEN
THIS MAN BEFORE?

36:40.930 --> 36:41.897
NOTHING?

36:41.930 --> 36:43.522
NO. YOU?

36:51.470 --> 36:53.563
NO, LOOK AT HIM.
SEEN HIM?

36:53.610 --> 36:56.204
YOU DIDN'T EVEN LOOK.

37:00.280 --> 37:01.918
DO YOU KNOW THIS MAN?

37:01.950 --> 37:04.214
THANK YOU.

37:07.850 --> 37:11.217
HE'S GOTTA BE
OUT HERE SOMEWHERE.

37:21.540 --> 37:23.337
HOW MUCH?

37:23.370 --> 37:24.906
HEY, WHERE YOU GOING?

37:24.940 --> 37:26.828
DON'T RUN AWAY FROM ME.

37:31.580 --> 37:33.377
RONALD WEEMS,
DON'T MOVE!

37:33.410 --> 37:37.312
PUT YOUR HANDS
IN THE AIR AND GET
DOWN ON YOUR KNEES.

37:37.350 --> 37:38.009
THEY LIED TO ME.

37:38.050 --> 37:39.779
GET HER
OUT OF HERE!

37:39.820 --> 37:41.287
ON THE GROUND!
AAH!

37:41.320 --> 37:42.753
HE KILLED MY FRIEND!

37:42.790 --> 37:44.985
I KNOW. STOP IT!
SHE MACED ME.

37:45.030 --> 37:45.883
YEAH, SHE DID.

37:47.760 --> 37:51.890
THEY SAID THEY'D CLEAN 'EM
OFF THE STREETS. THEY LIED.

37:51.930 --> 37:54.728
WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO?!

38:04.550 --> 38:07.701
HEY, REID.

38:09.720 --> 38:10.744
HEY.
HI.

38:10.780 --> 38:13.943
I HEARD THE
JUVENILE AUTHORITIES
LET YOU GO TODAY.

38:13.990 --> 38:15.719
I'M SORRY
I WASN'T THERE.

38:15.760 --> 38:17.409
MM, IT'S ALL RIGHT.

38:17.460 --> 38:18.119
WHERE'S YOUR MOM?

38:18.160 --> 38:20.822
OH, SHE HAD TO
GO BACK TO WORK.

38:20.860 --> 38:23.055
I TOLD HER I WAS
COMING TO SEE YOU.

38:23.100 --> 38:26.888
SO WERE YOU THERE
WHEN THEY CAUGHT HIM?

38:26.930 --> 38:27.999
YEAH, I WAS.

38:28.030 --> 38:31.295
DID HE SAY HOW LONG
HE KNEW WHAT HE WAS?

38:31.940 --> 38:32.634
NO.

38:32.670 --> 38:34.035
WELL, DO YOU THINK
IT'S POSSIBLE

38:34.070 --> 38:36.379
TO MAYBE TALK TO HIM OR...

38:36.910 --> 38:38.901
I'M SORRY.

38:38.950 --> 38:41.441
YOU'RE NOT HIM.

38:41.480 --> 38:44.938
WHO WE ARE IS--IT'S
CONSTANTLY EVOLVING.

38:44.990 --> 38:47.117
HEH. I'M A LOT OLDER
THAN YOU,

38:47.150 --> 38:49.084
AND I'M CHANGING
ALL THE TIME.

38:49.120 --> 38:53.523
YOU KNOW, THIS--
THIS JOB CHANGES ME.

38:53.560 --> 38:54.788
YOU'VE CHANGED ME.

38:54.830 --> 38:59.961
YOU SOUGHT ME OUT
TO TRY TO UNDERSTAND
HOW NOT TO HARM PEOPLE.

39:00.000 --> 39:03.697
IT'S A FAR MORE
IMPORTANT PART
OF WHO YOU ARE

39:03.740 --> 39:06.629
THAN THE ONE
THAT SCARES YOU.

39:09.880 --> 39:11.438
MY MOM WANTS TO...

39:11.480 --> 39:14.847
HAVE ME GO TO A HOSPITAL
FOR A LITTLE BIT.

39:14.880 --> 39:17.440
MAYBE THAT'S NOT
SUCH A BAD IDEA.

39:17.480 --> 39:19.084
YOU KNOW,
ONCE THEY LOCK ME UP,

39:19.120 --> 39:21.611
THEY'RE NEVER GONNA
LET ME OUT OF THERE.

39:21.660 --> 39:22.684
YOU DON'T KNOW THAT.

39:22.720 --> 39:27.089
WHATEVER. I JUST CAME
TO SAY GOOD-BYE.

39:29.030 --> 39:30.019
WHEN YOU GOING IN?

39:30.060 --> 39:33.461
SUPPOSED TO BE TOMORROW.

39:34.500 --> 39:38.129
SO, LAST NIGHT OF FREEDOM.

39:39.540 --> 39:43.499
I DON'T KNOW. I'M--
THANK YOU FOR CARING.

39:48.920 --> 39:51.480
T.S. ELIOT WROTE

AND THE SPASM,

"FALLS THE SHADOW.

40:01.260 --> 40:03.751

40:03.800 --> 40:06.018
YOU LOOKING
FOR A DATE?

40:06.070 --> 40:08.834
SUIT YOURSELF.

40:08.870 --> 40:09.564
YOU SCARED ME.

40:09.600 --> 40:11.932
I'M ACTUALLY
LOOKING FOR A DATE.

40:11.970 --> 40:13.961
COME ON.

40:16.480 --> 40:21.873
COME ON, YOU AND ME,
WE'RE HITTING THE TOWN.

40:22.120 --> 40:23.439
NO OFFENSE, GARCIA,
BUT...

40:23.480 --> 40:28.713
I'M NOT REALLY FEELING
LIKE I'D MAKE THE, UH,
BEST COMPANY RIGHT NOW.

40:28.760 --> 40:31.627
OH, NO. UP. UP.

40:31.660 --> 40:34.493
DO NOT MAKE ME
HURT YOU.

40:36.130 --> 40:39.497
THERE YOU GO.
THERE YOU GO.

40:43.140 --> 40:44.835
JUST RELAX.

40:44.870 --> 40:48.101
DON'T YOU
WANNA FEEL ME?

40:52.110 --> 40:53.646
SEE?

40:53.680 --> 40:55.011
THERE.

40:55.050 --> 40:57.041
HOW DOES THAT
MAKE YOU FEEL?

40:57.080 --> 40:59.184
I DON'T KNOW.

40:59.220 --> 40:59.982
YES, YOU DO.

41:00.020 --> 41:03.183
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S--
IT'S NOT RIGHT.

41:03.220 --> 41:04.255
IT'S OK, BABY.

41:04.290 --> 41:06.850
YOU'RE JUST NERVOUS.

41:07.290 --> 41:10.999
THERE YOU GO.

41:12.000 --> 41:13.126
IT'S NOT WORKING.

41:13.170 --> 41:16.037
HEH. EVERYTHING'S
GONNA WORK JUST FINE.

41:16.070 --> 41:18.197
DON'T LAUGH AT ME.

41:18.240 --> 41:20.105
NOBODY'S LAUGHING.

41:20.140 --> 41:21.129
LET ME HELP YOU.

41:21.170 --> 41:23.730
DON'T TOUCH ME.
YOU'RE JUST A WHORE.

41:23.780 --> 41:27.102
YOU HAVE NO IDEA
WHAT I COULD DO TO YOU!

41:27.150 --> 41:30.847
HOW 'BOUT WE BOTH
JUST WALK AWAY?

41:30.880 --> 41:32.916
NO CHARGE.
NO.

41:42.200 --> 41:44.964
YOU DON'T WANNA DO THIS.

41:46.800 --> 41:48.791
I HAVE TO.

41:49.170 --> 41:51.229
HAVE YOU MET ESTHER?

41:51.270 --> 41:52.931
YOU LIKE?
WOW.

41:52.970 --> 41:55.871
ONLY 150,000 MILES ON HER.

42:00.250 --> 42:01.569
HELLO.

42:01.620 --> 42:03.247
HEY.

42:03.280 --> 42:05.145
WHAT?

42:05.190 --> 42:05.918
OH, GOD.

42:05.950 --> 42:09.078
UH, UH, STAY--
STAY WHERE YOU ARE.

42:09.120 --> 42:10.189
I'M CALLING
AN AMBULANCE.

42:10.220 --> 42:12.780
I--I NEED YOU
TO DRIVE, GARCIA.

42:12.830 --> 42:14.024
YEAH, YEAH.

42:16.030 --> 42:18.123
HE JUST STARTED
SLASHING HIMSELF UP.

42:18.160 --> 42:19.923
OH, DEAR LORD.
ALL RIGHT, GIVE ME YOUR SCARF.

42:19.970 --> 42:21.767
TIE IT AROUND THERE
AS TIGHT AS YOU CAN.

42:21.800 --> 42:23.290
GET--GET ANYTHING AT ALL,
A BELT.

42:23.340 --> 42:24.068
DON'T.

42:24.100 --> 42:26.807
TIE IT!
IS IT TIGHT

42:26.840 --> 42:28.774
I THINK SO.
I THINK SO.

42:30.080 --> 42:31.308
THE PARAMEDICS. ..

42:31.340 --> 42:32.898
STOP. DON'T.

42:32.950 --> 42:34.303
I'M GONNA KEEP
PRESSURE ON HIM.

42:34.350 --> 42:37.740
NO.
WHERE THE HELL
ARE THE MEDICS?!

42:38.750 --> 42:39.614
IS IT TIGHT?

42:39.650 --> 42:40.844
I DON'T KNOW.
I THINK SO.
I DON'T KNOW.

42:40.890 --> 42:44.018
DON'T.
I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU DIE.

42:44.060 --> 42:45.084
NO.

42:45.130 --> 42:47.155
WHERE ARE THE MEDICS?!

42:48.700 --> 42:50.019
YOU CAN LET GO NOW.

42:50.060 --> 42:51.925
REID.

42:51.970 --> 42:53.597
LET GO.

42:53.630 --> 42:55.632
SIR.

42:55.870 --> 42:58.737
SIR, WE'RE PARAMEDICS.
WE'RE HERE TO HELP YOU.

42:58.770 --> 43:01.978
CAN YOU TELL ME
YOUR NAME, SIR?

43:06.880 --> 43:08.916
HOW DID SHE
KNOW TO CALL REID?

43:08.950 --> 43:13.887
NATHAN SET REID'S
BUSINESS CARD ON THE TABLE
BEFORE HE CUT HIMSELF,

43:13.920 --> 43:16.252
LIKE A SUICIDE NOTE.

43:22.760 --> 43:26.196
PARAMEDICS SAY
HE WOULDN'T'VE MADE IT
WITHOUT YOU.

43:26.230 --> 43:28.892
YOU SAVED HIS LIFE.

43:30.070 --> 43:32.265
HE WANTED ME
TO LET HIM DIE.

43:32.310 --> 43:36.030
HE'S SICK.
HE NEEDED SAVING.

43:36.340 --> 43:41.243
HOW MANY PEOPLE'S LIVES
DID I RISK IN THE FUTURE?

43:41.280 --> 43:44.272
PROFILES CAN BE WRONG.

43:46.250 --> 43:48.218
WHAT IF IT'S NOT?
WHAT IF...

43:48.250 --> 43:51.617
NEXT TIME,
HE KILLS SOMEBODY?

43:51.960 --> 43:54.155
THEN YOU CATCH HIM.
