WEBVTT

00:17.017 --> 00:18.518
Here you go, two lattes.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.186
It's perfect.

00:21.771 --> 00:23.189
Thanks for suggesting this.

00:24.983 --> 00:29.821
Six years of sobriety,
just... poof.

00:30.780 --> 00:31.948
Slips happen.

00:33.241 --> 00:35.577
They don't erase the progress
that you've made.

00:38.538 --> 00:42.208
That day at our house
when you came by to check on us,

00:43.543 --> 00:44.878
you knew, didn't you?

00:45.837 --> 00:46.755
I suspected.

00:47.672 --> 00:50.550
Everybody's recovery is different,
but what worked for me

00:50.967 --> 00:52.135
was small steps.

00:53.344 --> 00:54.721
It's all about tomorrow,

00:55.138 --> 00:56.389
not the next year,

00:57.015 --> 00:58.183
or the next five.

00:59.017 --> 01:00.810
I just feel stuck in today.

01:01.394 --> 01:03.605
Whatever step
that's supposed to be.

01:06.149 --> 01:06.983
Matheson...

01:07.067 --> 01:09.986
was supposed to be
our fresh start.

01:11.738 --> 01:14.491
I thought I'd feel closer to my husband,

01:15.366 --> 01:16.659
connect some dots about his past,

01:19.120 --> 01:21.706
but it hasn't quite worked out
the way I hoped.

01:22.999 --> 01:24.292
Maybe living here...

01:25.210 --> 01:26.544
is not healthy for me...

01:27.420 --> 01:28.880
or my kids.

01:35.386 --> 01:37.472
-Where's Ellie?

01:38.264 --> 01:39.432
It's only been an hour.

01:40.391 --> 01:42.685
She should've been here by now
with the crown.

01:43.269 --> 01:44.437
We just need to wait,

01:44.771 --> 01:45.897
and stay ready.

01:45.980 --> 01:47.607
What happens if Mom comes home?

01:47.941 --> 01:49.400
This'll all be over by then.

01:53.071 --> 01:54.823
Uh... Guys?

01:55.448 --> 01:56.658
Look!

02:09.838 --> 02:10.964
I hope you don't mind,

02:11.506 --> 02:13.716
I invited some friends.

02:19.222 --> 02:20.140
Shit.

02:34.571 --> 02:36.281
Just... a scare tactic.

02:38.158 --> 02:40.410
Shadows are just shadows.

02:51.504 --> 02:53.047
Get inside, now!

03:00.847 --> 03:02.307
Help me barricade the door!

03:11.191 --> 03:13.109
- What do you see?

03:15.570 --> 03:19.407
-There's nothing out there.
- I don't like this.

03:20.658 --> 03:21.784
Where did she go?

03:22.827 --> 03:24.204
Did you lock the side door?

03:40.637 --> 03:41.554
It's too quiet.

03:41.638 --> 03:42.764
I'm gonna go check upstairs.

03:42.847 --> 03:43.973
Not without me.

03:44.057 --> 03:46.059
Well, you just can't leave me here.

03:47.852 --> 03:49.729
- Tyler?

04:01.783 --> 04:03.117
- Stop!

04:06.704 --> 04:07.580
Tyler!

04:12.085 --> 04:13.127
Where is it?

04:19.676 --> 04:21.135
-It's the lights.

04:21.844 --> 04:22.845
That's what stops them!

04:22.929 --> 04:25.056
-Okay, turn on all the lights.

04:32.188 --> 04:33.481
- The kitchen.

04:56.004 --> 04:58.172
-They're looking for the Omega Key.

04:58.756 --> 05:01.426
-It's safe, they can't get to it.

05:03.594 --> 05:05.305
Keep the lights on.

05:05.847 --> 05:07.974
As long as they're on,
they can't touch us.

05:10.059 --> 05:11.728
- What are you doing?

05:11.811 --> 05:13.688
Making a weapon
with the Matchstick Key.

05:19.193 --> 05:22.196
Come and get me,
Shadow Monsters!

05:32.832 --> 05:34.250
Uh-oh.

05:34.876 --> 05:36.753
-Fuse box.
-It's in the basement.

05:37.920 --> 05:39.339
I'll go turn the lights back on,

05:39.422 --> 05:40.673
you guys distract Dodge.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.228
Give me the key.

05:54.312 --> 05:55.271
Get back!

05:57.732 --> 06:00.026
There are more flashlights upstairs,
come on!

06:35.436 --> 06:38.689
Flashlights have to be in here somewhere.
Where are they?

07:23.734 --> 07:25.736
Where is the key?

07:33.703 --> 07:35.413
You're not gonna hurt us
anymore!

07:53.055 --> 07:54.265
Holy shit.

08:02.315 --> 08:03.566
Where did she go?

08:06.277 --> 08:07.278
Guys?

08:08.029 --> 08:08.905
Come see this!

08:22.960 --> 08:24.170
Did I kill her?

08:28.508 --> 08:32.094
After I stabbed her,
her shadow melted downstairs.

08:43.272 --> 08:44.398
She's still breathing.

08:50.696 --> 08:52.114
Whatever you did,

08:52.198 --> 08:53.616
she's out cold.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.410
Where's the crown?

08:57.161 --> 08:58.871
I don't know,
but first things first,

08:58.955 --> 09:00.581
is the Omega Key still safe?

09:12.051 --> 09:13.219
Affirmative.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.433
-What do we do with her now?
- We can't kill her.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.601
Why not?

09:20.893 --> 09:22.728
She's the reason why Dad is gone.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.106
I mean, we literally can't kill her.

09:25.189 --> 09:27.567
Ellie said Echoes can't be killed
by normal means.

09:27.650 --> 09:29.944
Maybe we can put her back
in the well house.

09:30.027 --> 09:31.737
We'll need the Echo Key for that,

09:31.821 --> 09:32.905
but Ellie has it.

09:33.114 --> 09:35.408
What if we send her back
where she came from?

09:36.576 --> 09:37.910
What are you talking about?

09:38.369 --> 09:39.495
The Black Door!

09:39.579 --> 09:42.707
We use the Omega Key
to open the Black Door and send her back.

09:42.790 --> 09:44.292
The last time that door was opened,

09:44.375 --> 09:48.045
Dad's friend got possessed by a demon
and he had to bludgeon him to death.

09:48.129 --> 09:49.714
What happens if she wakes up?

09:49.797 --> 09:51.799
If you have any better ideas,
I'm all ears.

09:53.551 --> 09:55.886
Wait,
so we're going to the sea caves?

09:56.012 --> 09:57.138
No, you're not,

09:57.471 --> 09:58.306
we are.

09:58.681 --> 10:00.016
You're staying here.

10:00.099 --> 10:02.935
Fine, but I'm gonna go check on Rufus.

10:03.019 --> 10:05.521
He and Ellie were supposed to come back
with the crown.

10:06.022 --> 10:07.773
If Ellie's in trouble, he could be too.

10:07.857 --> 10:09.275
That's not a good idea.

10:09.358 --> 10:10.985
Well, I can't just stay here!

10:11.319 --> 10:12.486
Rufus is my friend,

10:12.570 --> 10:15.406
and I don't care what you guys say,

10:15.489 --> 10:16.365
I'm going.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.117
Just don't do anything stupid.

10:18.200 --> 10:19.660
-You either.

10:24.165 --> 10:26.667
If we're gonna carry her
all the way down to those caves,

10:27.251 --> 10:28.628
we're gonna need some help.

10:31.213 --> 10:33.633
Demon Disposal Service, you rang?

10:34.300 --> 10:36.218
-Thanks for coming.
- No problem.

10:36.302 --> 10:38.054
-We brought back up too.

10:38.888 --> 10:41.265
Scot told us
you needed help.

10:42.099 --> 10:43.934
Yeah, and the FOMO was real.

10:48.064 --> 10:50.733
Wow, Eden, I... I did not expect this.

10:51.359 --> 10:54.737
Well, I was feeling a little bit generous
after my brush with death.

10:54.820 --> 10:56.280
Plus, I don't know who this bitch is,

10:56.364 --> 10:59.659
but she's not about to let
some rando demons run through my town.

10:59.992 --> 11:00.993
Well put.

11:01.077 --> 11:02.995
Yeah, we would've called
the rest of the Savinis,

11:03.079 --> 11:06.290
but you know, they still have
a little bit of "Cave PTSD," so...

11:06.374 --> 11:08.793
-It's okay, this is awesome.

11:10.044 --> 11:12.880
And I'm sorry
I freaked out earlier.

11:13.381 --> 11:15.883
I... Mostly I'm just sorry
that you didn't think

11:15.966 --> 11:18.219
you could tell me
about all this stuff sooner.

11:18.678 --> 11:21.889
Yeah, I didn't... I didn't think
that was gonna go over so well.

11:22.139 --> 11:24.016
-I get that,

11:24.975 --> 11:26.894
but I'm not scared.

11:28.562 --> 11:29.980
Then you're way ahead of me.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.151
-And I'm not going anywhere.

11:38.114 --> 11:39.824
Sorry, sorry. It was--

11:39.907 --> 11:42.034
It was nice, like a really sweet moment,

11:42.159 --> 11:46.288
but I just feel like
we have a demon to be dealing with, and...

11:47.164 --> 11:49.166
You know, uh, so where is she?

11:49.375 --> 11:51.711
He-- It--
I don't know what the pronoun is,

11:51.836 --> 11:53.838
demon non-binary. What are we doing?

12:05.266 --> 12:08.310
Not exactly what I picture
when I think of "formidable demon."

12:08.394 --> 12:10.604
Really? Pretty much
exactly what I was expecting.

12:11.188 --> 12:13.315
Oh, come on. Where are the fangs?
Where are the horns?

12:13.399 --> 12:14.900
-Where are the--
-No, no, this is all--

12:14.984 --> 12:17.361
This is all meant to lull you
into a false sense of security.

12:17.528 --> 12:18.946
You know, the perfect bone structure

12:19.029 --> 12:20.239
and the impeccable style--

12:20.322 --> 12:22.533
Guys, can we focus?

12:24.076 --> 12:25.494
Where'd you put the flashlights?

12:25.578 --> 12:26.495
I'll get them.

12:29.915 --> 12:30.958
What?

12:31.250 --> 12:32.418
Do not post that.

12:34.754 --> 12:35.755
Fine.

12:38.799 --> 12:41.010
I guess it makes sense
really, doesn't it?

12:41.093 --> 12:43.137
Demons have to be disposed of properly,

12:43.596 --> 12:47.433
so throwing them behind a big demon door
just seems logical, doesn't it?

12:47.975 --> 12:50.519
You know, that being said, I don't know,

12:50.603 --> 12:52.646
I feel like this is a little bit doomed,
you know?

12:52.730 --> 12:54.482
I'm not saying like it is doomed,

12:54.565 --> 12:57.193
but I definitely feel like
we're walking towards the Gates of Mordor.

12:57.276 --> 12:58.527
Can I ask a question?

12:58.861 --> 13:00.696
Besides, Scot, can you stop talking?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.156
Yes, go, Eden.

13:02.239 --> 13:04.408
So what happens if she wakes up?

13:04.533 --> 13:06.285
Like do we have a plan for that?

13:06.368 --> 13:08.078
- I brought a knife.

13:08.162 --> 13:10.581
Oh, you're gonna have a knife-fight
with the demon?

13:10.664 --> 13:12.833
You can't kill her with a knife.

13:12.917 --> 13:15.002
Might at least give us
a head start.

13:15.085 --> 13:16.587
Okay, any more questions?

13:16.921 --> 13:18.923
Yeah, can we just get this over with?

13:26.013 --> 13:28.015
How's the tide situation?

13:28.724 --> 13:30.726
It's just past full-low.

13:31.477 --> 13:32.853
We're okay if we go now.

13:32.937 --> 13:33.896
Are we?

13:36.190 --> 13:37.900
Look, no one has to go down.

13:37.983 --> 13:38.943
No, we're going.

13:40.528 --> 13:41.946
I mean, at least I am.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.323
Me too.

13:45.991 --> 13:47.201
Yeah, of course.

13:52.414 --> 13:55.584
Not one to resist some good,
old-fashioned peer pressure, am I?

13:56.627 --> 13:57.628
I'm in.

14:04.969 --> 14:05.803
Rufus?

14:06.887 --> 14:07.721
Ellie?

14:10.182 --> 14:11.433
Rufus?

14:13.018 --> 14:14.019
Rufus?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.149
Rufus! Rufus!

14:19.942 --> 14:20.776
Rufus,

14:20.860 --> 14:21.694
wake up!

14:24.154 --> 14:25.030
Help!

14:47.469 --> 14:48.888
Here we go again.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.848
Watch your head.

14:54.059 --> 14:55.686
It's worse than last time.

15:01.025 --> 15:02.860
-How did you guys find this place?

15:02.943 --> 15:04.862
We were gonna shoot the movie
in here.

15:05.112 --> 15:08.115
Yeah, no, I would've quit
if I hadn't already quit.

15:08.616 --> 15:09.867
Go ahead. I got it.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.622
Okay.

15:14.872 --> 15:16.832
-Well, that was fun.

15:29.762 --> 15:31.138
You're hearing that, right?

15:31.680 --> 15:35.476
You mean the really scary
rumbling sound?

16:03.796 --> 16:06.006
What do you suppose
is on the other side of this?

16:06.298 --> 16:07.174
Nothing good.

16:08.008 --> 16:09.927
Yup. Well, unless you're a demon.

16:10.511 --> 16:12.346
Let's just do this and get out of here.

16:13.263 --> 16:14.515
I don't think we should.

16:15.057 --> 16:16.183
It was your idea!

16:19.061 --> 16:20.479
Does this feel right to you?

16:24.525 --> 16:26.235
If you got any better ideas, I'm all ears.

16:26.318 --> 16:28.404
Best-available idea doesn't make something
a good idea.

16:28.487 --> 16:31.323
Uh, okay, I hate to break up
a good old sibling squabble,

16:31.407 --> 16:33.033
but I am very worried about these tides

16:33.117 --> 16:35.327
and I do have some experience
to back that up.

16:35.536 --> 16:37.079
Shit. Yeah, we should hurry.

16:37.162 --> 16:38.789
That is not what you said before.

16:38.872 --> 16:41.208
Yeah, it took a lot longer
to get down here than I thought.

16:43.544 --> 16:44.878
Is she waking up?

16:44.962 --> 16:46.964
Oh, no. No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

16:50.092 --> 16:51.343
Hey, guys, we gotta do this now.

16:52.469 --> 16:53.470
Are you sure?

16:53.554 --> 16:54.972
We can't take it back.

16:56.056 --> 16:58.058
Kinsey, we're here.

16:58.809 --> 16:59.977
We can end this...

17:00.436 --> 17:02.312
-for Dad.

17:06.233 --> 17:08.360
-All right.

17:10.779 --> 17:11.613
Okay...

17:12.865 --> 17:16.118
Kinsey will unlock the door,
the rest of you, stay on it.

17:16.201 --> 17:18.537
If something happens, just close it.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.004
I'll carry Dodge to the edge
and throw her through.

17:27.087 --> 17:29.131
And if anything exits that door
when we open it?

17:29.214 --> 17:31.091
Wait, hold on. Anything like what?

17:32.259 --> 17:34.470
Ellie said they were like glowing bullets.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.057
Just don't let them hit you, okay?

18:27.648 --> 18:28.649
That's...

18:28.732 --> 18:29.691
What is that?

18:29.775 --> 18:30.609
Yeah.

18:36.490 --> 18:37.658
- Look out!

18:46.416 --> 18:47.918
- There's another one.

18:48.544 --> 18:49.920
What are you doing?

18:50.921 --> 18:51.797
No!

18:51.880 --> 18:53.090
No! No!

18:53.215 --> 18:56.009
Tyler, don't!

18:56.176 --> 18:57.094
No!

19:01.557 --> 19:02.391
No!

19:06.436 --> 19:08.438
No!

19:13.569 --> 19:14.444
No!

19:17.322 --> 19:18.323
Close the door!

19:51.648 --> 19:54.401
Okay, I hope
we never have to do that again.

19:54.484 --> 19:56.528
I don't think that's actually an option.

19:56.612 --> 19:58.113
Is it weird that I kinda had fun?

19:58.197 --> 19:59.907
No weirder than what we just saw.

20:00.407 --> 20:02.409
Tyler, Kinsey, you guys were awesome.

20:02.951 --> 20:04.536
We all did it, everybody.

20:05.412 --> 20:08.248
Do you guys want some food
or something before you leave?

20:08.332 --> 20:10.459
I mean,
it's the least we can do to thank you.

20:10.542 --> 20:11.919
I've always got an appetite.

20:12.002 --> 20:13.212
Yeah, I'm down!

20:14.880 --> 20:16.715
-Kins?

20:17.007 --> 20:18.050
You got a minute?

20:20.010 --> 20:22.429
Uh...

20:23.305 --> 20:27.017
I know this probably isn't necessarily
the best time to do this, but, uh...

20:27.684 --> 20:29.478
I've been thinking a lot about...

20:30.187 --> 20:31.521
your notion

20:32.439 --> 20:35.359
that Gabe and I both date you...

20:36.193 --> 20:37.110
and...

20:38.362 --> 20:40.197
I've just gotta say that that's...

20:40.989 --> 20:42.491
that's not gonna work for me.

20:44.201 --> 20:47.120
So, if you're undecided, then...

20:48.497 --> 20:50.582
then that is your decision.

20:52.668 --> 20:53.835
I understand.

20:57.381 --> 20:58.215
Right.

20:58.757 --> 21:00.717
Great. So, I mean, we can be friends.

21:00.801 --> 21:02.427
You know, great friends, I hope.

21:02.552 --> 21:05.430
Right? Tried and true,
bonded by demons

21:05.514 --> 21:07.391
and magic and all sorts.

21:07.975 --> 21:08.809
Yeah?

21:08.892 --> 21:10.185
I hope so too.

21:22.656 --> 21:24.408
Okay, so my mom

21:24.491 --> 21:26.743
-is gonna live until she's 109.

21:26.827 --> 21:29.371
She has more energy than I had
when I was 20.

21:29.454 --> 21:31.665
-Ooh.
-She comes up here to visit me sometimes,

21:32.291 --> 21:34.668
but mostly because she wants
to clean my house.

21:34.751 --> 21:36.003
No, and you let her?

21:36.086 --> 21:38.171
-Yes! Try and stop her!

21:38.255 --> 21:40.716
I may be a cop,
but I am not saying no to Mom.

21:40.966 --> 21:42.467
-Oh, uh...

21:45.095 --> 21:46.054
Matuku.

21:47.264 --> 21:48.098
Yeah.

21:50.183 --> 21:51.018
Yeah.

21:51.852 --> 21:53.603
Okay, on my way.

21:55.564 --> 21:56.648
Police business.

21:56.940 --> 21:57.858
Afraid so.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.443
I, uh... I gotta go.

21:59.526 --> 22:01.153
Of course.

22:03.280 --> 22:04.990
I really enjoyed this.

22:05.073 --> 22:06.241
Yeah, me too.

22:28.555 --> 22:29.389
Hey.

22:32.559 --> 22:33.560
Your friend's okay.

22:34.644 --> 22:37.356
They're gonna take him to the hospital
so he can get checked out.

22:38.774 --> 22:40.609
You can go see him now, if you want.

22:41.777 --> 22:42.652
Thanks.

22:48.450 --> 22:50.035
-Bode.
-Are you okay?

22:50.410 --> 22:53.038
- I usually feel a lot better.

22:53.330 --> 22:54.456
Well, what happened?

22:55.040 --> 22:55.999
Where's your mom?

22:56.708 --> 22:57.751
I don't know.

23:00.545 --> 23:04.758
Lucas used one of the keys
to turn himself into a lady,

23:05.675 --> 23:07.928
with long, black hair.

23:09.763 --> 23:10.806
That's Dodge.

23:12.224 --> 23:13.058
Here.

23:16.603 --> 23:17.646
Take this.

23:21.525 --> 23:22.651
Rufus, you okay there?

23:23.151 --> 23:24.027
Affirmative.

23:26.238 --> 23:27.739
Sorry, kid, we gotta go now.

23:31.076 --> 23:32.035
Goodbye, Bode.

23:32.494 --> 23:33.578
Bye, Rufus.

23:55.058 --> 23:56.143
Where's Dodge?

23:56.226 --> 23:57.978
She's gone, for good.

23:58.061 --> 24:00.397
So you threw her through the door?

24:00.981 --> 24:02.941
-In the cave?
- Yeah.

24:03.817 --> 24:05.152
Are you sure it was Dodge?

24:06.486 --> 24:07.696
Why would you ask that?

24:07.779 --> 24:09.781
I went to Rufus' house, right?

24:09.865 --> 24:10.907
Right.

24:10.991 --> 24:13.160
When I got there, Rufus was knocked out.

24:13.785 --> 24:16.204
So I called 911 and the police came,

24:16.496 --> 24:17.747
and his mom was missing.

24:18.290 --> 24:20.625
And then when he woke up,
he told me

24:20.792 --> 24:23.795
-that Lucas did it.
- Wait, what?

24:24.337 --> 24:25.338
Where's Ellie?

24:25.672 --> 24:27.132
Nobody knows.

24:28.175 --> 24:30.010
And since Lucas is Dodge,

24:30.594 --> 24:33.221
I just wanted to make sure
you guys got rid of her.

24:38.268 --> 24:39.102
Trust me.

24:40.312 --> 24:41.354
She's gone.

24:42.147 --> 24:46.735
We both saw her get swallowed up
in whatever was on the other side.

24:49.738 --> 24:50.614
Okay?

24:51.531 --> 24:53.241
-Okay?

24:53.867 --> 24:54.951
We're safe now.

24:56.620 --> 24:58.955
Okay.

25:14.429 --> 25:16.264
Hey, late risers!

25:16.556 --> 25:17.641
-Uncle Dunc!
- Hey...

25:17.724 --> 25:20.018
What, you guys have a raucous night
or something last night?

25:20.143 --> 25:22.145
- Or something.
- Get it while it's hot!

25:22.687 --> 25:25.023
Look at this spread! Did you make this?

25:25.649 --> 25:27.234
No, no, this was all your mom!

25:28.026 --> 25:29.319
<i>Delicioso!</i>

25:31.446 --> 25:33.615
Does anyone know what happened
to Dad's car?

25:33.698 --> 25:38.370
I was driving it to the store this morning
and something's wrong with the steering.

25:38.453 --> 25:39.955
It was shaking and wobbling...

25:40.539 --> 25:43.166
I felt like
I was riding in a blender!

25:44.584 --> 25:45.669
I guess I'll have to, uh,

25:45.752 --> 25:47.629
-take it to the shop.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.840
When I was at the store,
I saw Bernadette from school.

25:52.175 --> 25:54.052
Nobody's heard a word about Ellie.

25:54.135 --> 25:55.220
Nothing?

25:55.303 --> 25:58.515
No, so weird. What about Rufus?

25:59.224 --> 26:00.892
He slept with some neighbors last night,

26:00.976 --> 26:03.436
and his aunt and uncle are flying in
from Nebraska this morning.

26:05.522 --> 26:06.481
Anyway...

26:08.066 --> 26:09.526
before everyone runs off,

26:10.277 --> 26:11.945
we need to have a little family meeting.

26:12.028 --> 26:12.946
It's important.

26:13.029 --> 26:15.115
And you're gonna need to hear this too.

26:16.116 --> 26:17.200
Okay...

26:17.659 --> 26:18.868
What about?

26:18.952 --> 26:19.786
Yeah.

26:25.625 --> 26:26.751
I made a mistake

26:27.502 --> 26:28.628
moving us here.

26:30.255 --> 26:32.257
I thought it was a good idea at the time.

26:32.799 --> 26:36.219
I wanted to learn more
about your Dad's past,

26:36.761 --> 26:39.264
and I thought the change would do us good.

26:40.974 --> 26:45.145
I dragged all of you out here
against your wishes, and now,

26:46.271 --> 26:47.856
we get to go back home.

26:51.484 --> 26:53.445
This house is in good enough shape

26:53.528 --> 26:55.030
for us to sell, and...

26:56.364 --> 27:00.160
we can use that money
to buy a great new house in Seattle.

27:00.243 --> 27:01.911
And that will be our house!

27:02.495 --> 27:05.540
We'll just consider this
a necessary little side-trip...

27:06.374 --> 27:07.459
At least, for me.

27:08.293 --> 27:11.546
But now,
we get to go back to our normal lives.

27:17.052 --> 27:18.219
Okay.

27:18.303 --> 27:20.972
Don't everybody jump for joy
all at once.

27:23.266 --> 27:24.851
We actually like it here.

27:26.394 --> 27:29.814
Yeah. I mean, it did seem
like a shitty idea at the time.

27:30.815 --> 27:32.025
Now, we love it here!

27:32.108 --> 27:36.613
I wouldn't say love it,
but I don't... I don't wanna move again.

27:36.988 --> 27:38.365
Me either.

27:39.282 --> 27:40.158
Seriously?

27:41.534 --> 27:43.453
You guys want to stay?

27:43.536 --> 27:45.121
Yeah, definitely.

27:45.205 --> 27:48.166
-I thought you guys hated this place.
- We did,

27:48.792 --> 27:50.669
until... until we didn't.

27:51.169 --> 27:54.172
Because we finally got good WiFi.

27:56.758 --> 27:59.135
And maybe Dad didn't always love it here,

27:59.219 --> 28:01.513
but this place is still part of who he is.

28:02.764 --> 28:03.890
We like being here....

28:04.683 --> 28:05.767
where he lived.

28:06.685 --> 28:09.562
I'm not sure that I get a vote,
but, um...

28:09.646 --> 28:12.190
you're the best thing
to ever happen to this place...

28:13.066 --> 28:15.110
-since at least the 1890s.
- Okay.

28:17.195 --> 28:20.407
Well, I'm just processing all of this.

28:20.990 --> 28:24.536
I really felt
like I made a horrible mistake.

28:25.620 --> 28:26.663
You didn't.

28:29.040 --> 28:29.916
Okay?

28:33.294 --> 28:35.922
Uh... Hey, what about me?

28:36.005 --> 28:37.757
Come on!

28:37.841 --> 28:39.843
It's not a group hug without me!

28:44.264 --> 28:45.223
<i>Dear Rufus,</i>

28:45.890 --> 28:48.685
<i>I hope you're getting settled</i>
<i>at your uncle's house.</i>

28:48.768 --> 28:51.229
-<i>We drove through Nebraska</i>

28:51.312 --> 28:52.814
<i>on our way to Matheson.</i>

28:53.314 --> 28:56.860
<i>Kool-Aid was invented there,</i>
<i>so it must be a pretty great place.</i>

28:58.278 --> 29:01.156
<i>My mom has been helping</i>
<i>the police detective look for your mom.</i>

29:02.449 --> 29:04.576
<i>I know something weird happened</i>
<i>that night...</i>

29:05.952 --> 29:09.038
<i>...and I promise you,</i>
<i>I'm going to figure it out.</i>

29:13.793 --> 29:15.962
<i>At first, these keys were fun,</i>

29:16.963 --> 29:17.881
<i>but now we know</i>

29:17.964 --> 29:19.215
<i>that they're more than that.</i>

29:19.591 --> 29:20.759
<i>They're important.</i>

29:22.010 --> 29:23.136
<i>They're part of our family...</i>

29:27.223 --> 29:28.933
<i>and we need to protect them.</i>

29:32.645 --> 29:35.732
-<i>We're the new Keepers of the Keys.</i>

29:38.777 --> 29:39.819
<i>One more thing,</i>

29:40.278 --> 29:43.364
<i>mail me a picture of the front door</i>

29:46.117 --> 29:48.244
<i>I'm coming straight to Nebraska!</i>

29:50.497 --> 29:52.874
<i>Your fellow soldier, Bode.</i>

30:39.587 --> 30:41.005
You're home now, Rendell.

30:44.509 --> 30:45.510
We're home.

31:03.862 --> 31:06.239
So I guess you're stuck with me
all summer now.

31:06.322 --> 31:08.116
You say that like it's a bad thing.

31:09.117 --> 31:10.159
Hold on one sec.

31:10.243 --> 31:11.160
Where are you headed?

31:11.244 --> 31:12.579
Going fishing with Jackie.

31:12.662 --> 31:15.164
Her parents have this,
like, ridiculous boat.

31:15.915 --> 31:16.749
Wanna come?

31:17.166 --> 31:19.043
I'm going to grab a bite at Phil's
with Gabe.

31:19.127 --> 31:20.044
Phil's is trash!

31:20.128 --> 31:21.296
Yeah, yeah!

31:21.421 --> 31:23.590
- Have fun!
-Yeah, you too!

31:26.301 --> 31:27.886
So, I'll see you at six?

31:27.969 --> 31:29.762
Yeah, perfect.

31:48.364 --> 31:49.574
What's up? I'm Gabe.

31:51.034 --> 31:51.993
Craft service?

31:57.457 --> 32:00.168
I mean, that door was...
what the hell was that thing?

32:01.294 --> 32:02.295
I don't know.

32:03.338 --> 32:05.590
I think it has something to do
with the magic.

32:06.549 --> 32:09.427
You think you have a key
that might open it, or...

32:10.762 --> 32:13.181
<i>I should never have made you guys</i>
<i>go down there.</i>

32:13.473 --> 32:15.224
<i>You didn't make us do anything.</i>

32:15.808 --> 32:17.936
<i>I mean, I'm excited to be alive right now!</i>

32:19.062 --> 32:20.063
You just...

32:20.647 --> 32:21.856
you have that effect on people.

32:22.482 --> 32:24.734
You have this energy that I think

32:24.817 --> 32:26.819
we'd all follow, anywhere.

32:27.612 --> 32:28.613
You're a badass.

32:30.281 --> 32:31.449
<i>I like this Kinsey.</i>

32:42.961 --> 32:44.212
I should go.

32:46.631 --> 32:47.799
I'll call you tomorrow?

32:48.424 --> 32:49.759
Sure.

32:52.470 --> 32:53.388
Okay.

33:31.884 --> 33:33.928
-So...

33:34.637 --> 33:36.723
where can a girl get a drink around here?

33:37.306 --> 33:41.310
<i>♪ I saw the devil</i>
<i>In a violent dream ♪</i>

34:19.057 --> 34:20.266
What are you doing?

34:35.531 --> 34:36.365
No.

34:47.335 --> 34:50.630
You're not gonna hurt us
anymore!

35:26.457 --> 35:27.375
Guys?

35:29.043 --> 35:30.044
Come see this!

36:16.215 --> 36:17.466
So, how are you feeling?

36:20.595 --> 36:22.305
So hungry.
