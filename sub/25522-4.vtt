WEBVTT

02:36.073 --> 02:38.366
Shit.

02:38.450 --> 02:39.742
Still in Wind Gap.

03:31.962 --> 03:33.796
You be safe...

03:33.881 --> 03:35.089
today.

04:36.401 --> 04:37.944
Camille.

04:38.028 --> 04:39.820
I wanna talk to you.

04:49.498 --> 04:52.750
♪ Happy birthday to you ♪

04:52.834 --> 04:54.919
Another time, OK?

05:28.787 --> 05:30.788
- Yeah.
- So ugly.

05:33.250 --> 05:34.917
Hey, sis!

05:36.795 --> 05:38.629
Please don't be mad.

05:41.675 --> 05:44.176
I was just pissed at you
for blowing me off last night.

05:44.261 --> 05:46.554
I wasn't blowing you off.
I was doing my job.

05:46.638 --> 05:49.515
With that hot cop.
I'd totally fuck him.

05:49.599 --> 05:51.308
Shut up, Jodes.

05:51.393 --> 05:53.519
My sister's boyfriend
you're talkin' about.

05:53.603 --> 05:55.354
That's not my boyfriend.

05:55.439 --> 05:57.732
Not yet,
but he likes you.

05:57.816 --> 05:59.859
I can tell.

05:59.943 --> 06:03.195
Please forgive me.

06:03.280 --> 06:05.781
Sometimes when I show off
in front of my friends,

06:05.866 --> 06:07.658
I get carried away.

06:09.119 --> 06:11.203
I don't feel like
fightin' with you.

06:11.288 --> 06:13.247
Wanna see something funny?

06:13.331 --> 06:14.999
This kid at school, J.C.,

06:15.083 --> 06:19.628
came up with a crazy meme.

06:19.713 --> 06:20.921
Hilarious!

06:21.006 --> 06:22.882
Everybody thinks he did it, huh?

06:24.426 --> 06:27.094
- Want some?
- No. Thank you.

06:27.179 --> 06:29.346
OK. Well, if you
change your mind,

06:29.431 --> 06:31.390
we'll be out
behind the stables.

06:32.559 --> 06:35.478
- Camille.
- What?

06:35.562 --> 06:38.064
Don't tell Mama.

06:39.941 --> 06:42.193
Oh, my God!

06:45.906 --> 06:48.699
Is your hand
getting any better, dear?

06:48.784 --> 06:50.993
You know us Crellin women.

06:51.078 --> 06:53.037
Slow healers.

06:53.121 --> 06:56.665
Oh, could you slice those
a tiny bit smaller, please?

06:58.710 --> 07:00.669
Why aren't you ready?

07:00.754 --> 07:04.006
I'm gonna have to ask you
to give my regrets to Jackie.

07:04.091 --> 07:06.550
This cut on my hand
is giving me fits.

07:06.635 --> 07:08.928
It's barely a scratch.

07:09.012 --> 07:11.639
To you, maybe.

07:11.723 --> 07:13.307
Well, I'm sure the ladies

07:13.391 --> 07:15.101
will be disappointed
you're not there.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.561
I'll be giving them
the gift they so enjoy--

07:17.646 --> 07:19.939
the opportunity
to talk about me.

07:20.023 --> 07:23.776
Luckily, I'll have you
there to defend me.

07:23.860 --> 07:25.903
Well, I'm certain that occasion
will not arise.

07:28.740 --> 07:30.282
In Wind Gap,

07:30.367 --> 07:32.993
recyclables go out
on Wednesday.

08:00.939 --> 08:02.565
Jesus Christ.

08:04.901 --> 08:07.862
Make yourself
at home, Detective.

08:07.946 --> 08:10.281
I hope you don't mind.
The door was open.

08:10.365 --> 08:12.533
- What do you want?
- I need to know

08:12.617 --> 08:15.035
why you're following
John Keene.

08:15.120 --> 08:16.745
Who says I'm following
John Keene?

08:16.830 --> 08:18.455
John Keene. I bumped
into him at the store.

08:18.540 --> 08:19.832
He said, "Are you
following me, too?"

08:19.916 --> 08:21.458
- That boy's paranoid.
- Come on.

08:21.543 --> 08:23.544
There's only so many
cop cars in town.

08:25.672 --> 08:28.174
What are you gettin' at?

08:28.258 --> 08:30.509
We need to share information
before another little girl

08:30.594 --> 08:32.011
in this town loses her teeth.

08:32.095 --> 08:34.263
That's what I'm gettin' at.

08:34.347 --> 08:36.974
And I'll go first, since I'm
the visiting team here, okay?

08:37.058 --> 08:38.893
I'm meeting today
with the reporter.

08:38.977 --> 08:41.353
- Who, Preaker girl?
- Yeah.

08:41.438 --> 08:42.646
That woman knows something.

08:42.731 --> 08:43.856
I don't know what it is.

08:43.940 --> 08:46.400
Once she tells me,
I tell you.

08:46.484 --> 08:48.652
How do you know
she'll tell you?

08:48.737 --> 08:50.863
Call it intuition.

08:50.947 --> 08:53.407
Well, in Wind Gap
we call that something else.

08:53.491 --> 08:55.492
So, we have a deal?

08:57.537 --> 08:59.705
What do you got for me?

09:03.501 --> 09:05.544
Keene.

09:05.629 --> 09:07.171
Keene!

09:09.132 --> 09:11.258
I'm letting you go.
I'm letting you go.

09:11.343 --> 09:13.385
- What?
- Take off.

09:13.470 --> 09:15.429
Excuse me, what?

09:15.513 --> 09:17.181
You're done! Go home!

09:17.265 --> 09:19.391
Are you fuckin' serious?
What did I do?

09:27.776 --> 09:29.818
This fuckin' town.

09:34.366 --> 09:36.200
Camille Preaker!

09:36.284 --> 09:37.409
- Hey, honey.
- Hi, honey.

09:37.494 --> 09:38.661
Hi.

09:38.745 --> 09:40.746
She's here.
She's here.

09:42.582 --> 09:43.582
Mwah.

09:43.667 --> 09:45.542
Where is that
mother of yours?

09:45.627 --> 09:49.129
Uh, she is tending to
an injury, I'm afraid.

09:49.214 --> 09:52.883
But she's fine. She just cut
her finger on some rose bushes.

09:52.968 --> 09:54.843
But she really wanted
to be here.

09:54.928 --> 09:57.263
Uh-huh. Well,
that's a crock of shit.

09:59.349 --> 10:01.141
Adora'll be fine.
She's a fighter.

10:01.226 --> 10:02.726
Calhoun Day is comin' up.

10:02.811 --> 10:03.936
It always gets her spirits up.

10:04.020 --> 10:06.021
Calhoun Day.
Is that a good idea?

10:06.106 --> 10:09.233
That's a crime reporter's mind
at work right there.

10:09.317 --> 10:12.152
Every suspect in town
is roamin' around Adora's lawn

10:12.237 --> 10:14.029
with all that young,
fresh meat.

10:14.114 --> 10:16.490
Good Lord, Jackie,
that is so morbid.

10:16.574 --> 10:18.659
It's stupid is what it is.

10:18.743 --> 10:21.537
Excuse me!
Hello! Excuse me.

10:21.621 --> 10:24.331
Can we get some menus
over here, please?

10:26.376 --> 10:27.918
Thank you.

10:28.003 --> 10:29.837
So, Camille,
we're dyin' to know.

10:29.921 --> 10:32.298
Who do you think did it?
We want the inside scoop.

10:32.382 --> 10:34.174
Well, I want to know
what y'all think.

10:34.259 --> 10:36.510
What is the matter
with that girl?

10:36.594 --> 10:38.846
Well, I think
Anne's daddy--

10:38.930 --> 10:40.014
Bob Nash.
He did it.

10:40.098 --> 10:42.266
Now, that man
is a hot mess.

10:42.350 --> 10:43.809
Every time I'm in the store,

10:43.893 --> 10:46.395
all he does is stare
at my titties.

10:46.479 --> 10:48.314
Well, everybody does that.

10:48.398 --> 10:50.899
Maybe you should invest
in a better bra.

10:50.984 --> 10:53.319
Besides, Bob Nash has always
had it in for the Keenes.

10:53.403 --> 10:54.945
We all know why.

10:55.030 --> 10:56.697
Now, that
is just plain gossip.

10:56.781 --> 10:58.615
John Keene
and Julie Wheeler's

10:58.700 --> 11:00.909
little Miss Perfect
cheerleading daughter, Ashley,

11:00.994 --> 11:03.662
doing Lord knows what
in her own backyard.

11:03.747 --> 11:06.498
Well, I want to make him
my boy slave.

11:06.583 --> 11:10.044
I'll bet that boy
killed the Nash girl

11:10.128 --> 11:11.587
and then killed his own sister

11:11.671 --> 11:13.756
to cover up his tracks.

11:13.840 --> 11:15.424
No, I don't-- No.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.384
I don't think that John
killed his sister.

11:17.469 --> 11:19.636
He seems a little sweet.

11:19.721 --> 11:21.597
Too sweet, if you ask me.

11:21.681 --> 11:24.600
- Oh, hush.
- That is one strange family,

11:24.684 --> 11:26.352
and he is the strangest
of them all.

12:10.480 --> 12:14.274
♪ Glory, glory, hallelujah ♪

12:14.359 --> 12:18.737
♪ His truth is marching on ♪

12:18.822 --> 12:23.325
♪ His truth
is marching on ♪

12:27.872 --> 12:30.541
Zeke, you cannot go
and fight those Yankees.

12:30.625 --> 12:32.084
Who will defend
our children?

12:32.168 --> 12:33.585
I know you're afraid,
Miss Millie,

12:33.670 --> 12:35.421
evil is about to descend
on Wind Gap.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.172
What must be do,
my brave husband?

12:37.257 --> 12:40.676
You must fight
as I fight.

12:40.760 --> 12:42.928
I must go now, my love.
My men await me.

12:47.725 --> 12:49.226
And so...

12:49.310 --> 12:53.147
Millie Calhoun did what
was unthinkable at the time.

12:53.231 --> 12:56.191
She taught the women
of Wind Gap to shoot.

12:56.276 --> 12:57.526
And she formed

12:57.610 --> 12:59.111
the first female militia

12:59.195 --> 13:02.781
the world had ever seen.

13:02.866 --> 13:05.534
Wah, wah, wah.

13:08.455 --> 13:09.746
Very nice, guys.

13:09.831 --> 13:10.914
Very imaginative.

13:10.999 --> 13:12.708
Let's take a break.

13:24.846 --> 13:27.764
I don't think he liked it.

13:27.849 --> 13:29.725
Shut up, Jodes.
What do you know?

13:29.809 --> 13:32.352
He's a freakin'
weirdo anyway.

13:33.897 --> 13:35.314
Takes one to know one.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.665
Didn't you like
our performance today?

13:55.752 --> 13:58.921
It was entertaining.

13:59.005 --> 14:01.673
There was never an all-female
militia in Wind Gap.

14:01.758 --> 14:07.012
How do you know?
You weren't around.

14:07.096 --> 14:10.933
My mama says all of history
was written by men, so...

14:11.017 --> 14:13.101
of course they're gonna
make themselves look good.

14:13.186 --> 14:15.729
History is history, Amma.

14:15.813 --> 14:19.149
You can't change it,
you just learn from it.

14:19.234 --> 14:22.319
That why you're
always so sad?

14:24.656 --> 14:28.700
That because you can't
change your history?

14:39.212 --> 14:41.713
Don't be sad,
Mr. Lacey.

15:04.404 --> 15:06.697
Mom. Hey.

15:06.781 --> 15:08.782
Come on, Mama.

15:08.866 --> 15:10.784
Let's get you showered,
get some food in you.

15:10.868 --> 15:12.786
All right? I got you.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.622
Come on, I got you.

15:28.678 --> 15:30.262
Dinner's ready.

15:38.104 --> 15:39.855
Where the hell are you?

15:44.986 --> 15:45.986
On the record?

15:46.070 --> 15:47.821
Yeah.

15:47.905 --> 15:50.657
Huh. What makes you so sure

15:50.742 --> 15:52.034
he's gonna do that?

15:52.118 --> 15:54.077
Because he's ambitious.

15:54.162 --> 15:56.371
Cops like to see
their name in print.

15:56.456 --> 15:58.040
And I look good today.

15:58.124 --> 16:01.126
Yeah, so do I.

16:01.210 --> 16:04.004
Hey, uh, how is it
being back home?

16:06.507 --> 16:09.926
What doesn't kill you
makes you stronger.

16:10.011 --> 16:12.054
Unless it kills you.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.680
Thanks. I needed that.

16:13.765 --> 16:15.057
And I need a new piece.

16:15.141 --> 16:17.517
- You go get it.
- Yes, sir.

17:40.810 --> 17:43.520
Not today, child.
Your mom isn't well.

18:02.582 --> 18:05.459
You know, most first dates
are a dinner and a movie.

18:07.086 --> 18:09.296
I get a tour
of crime scenes.

18:09.380 --> 18:10.881
What does that say about you

18:10.965 --> 18:12.799
that you think
this is a date?

18:12.884 --> 18:15.677
Doesn't say much
about my social life, I guess.

18:15.762 --> 18:18.305
No, it doesn't.

18:18.389 --> 18:20.265
We had a deal,
remember?

18:20.349 --> 18:23.018
You are gonna answer
a question on the record

18:23.102 --> 18:25.479
for every crime scene
I show you.

18:25.563 --> 18:27.022
- Yeah.
- Yeah, that's the deal.

18:27.106 --> 18:29.107
That's the deal.
I get it.

18:31.444 --> 18:32.819
All right, so,

18:32.904 --> 18:36.907
crime scene number one.

18:36.991 --> 18:40.243
Two teenage girls,
madly in love,

18:40.328 --> 18:43.455
were found with
their wrists slashed.

18:43.539 --> 18:46.166
One of 'em
left behind a child.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.335
A baby, actually.

18:48.419 --> 18:49.920
Oh, I went to school
with that baby.

18:50.004 --> 18:52.798
Her name was
Faith Murray,

18:52.882 --> 18:54.591
but everybody called her
"Fag" Murray,

18:54.675 --> 18:56.927
like it was hereditary
or something.

18:59.222 --> 19:02.098
- Kind of ironic, considering.
- What?

19:02.183 --> 19:04.643
Well, Faith had sex
with a bunch of boys

19:04.727 --> 19:07.103
to prove that she wasn't
a lesbian like her mother.

19:10.691 --> 19:12.901
But no one ever
found a knife, so...

19:12.985 --> 19:15.403
murder-suicide.

19:15.488 --> 19:17.030
- That's strange.
- Yeah.

19:17.114 --> 19:19.115
What ever happened
to your friend Faith?

19:19.200 --> 19:20.742
She paid for the sins
of a mother

19:20.827 --> 19:22.160
that she had never met.

19:22.245 --> 19:24.955
So, instead of being a lesbian,
she became a slut.

19:25.039 --> 19:27.624
See, in Wind Gap,
every woman gets

19:27.708 --> 19:29.209
a nasty label if
they don't conform

19:29.293 --> 19:30.669
to the rules
of engagement.

19:30.753 --> 19:33.046
What's your label?

19:33.130 --> 19:36.633
No, no. Too many.
Too many to name.

19:36.717 --> 19:38.385
- Oh, come on.
- No.

19:38.469 --> 19:39.594
I can handle it.

19:39.679 --> 19:41.471
That is so
Wind Gap of you.

19:41.556 --> 19:43.890
You know?
You figure out someone's secrets

19:43.975 --> 19:45.350
to use it
against 'em later.

19:45.434 --> 19:47.394
No, that's not my style.

19:47.478 --> 19:49.062
Okay, well, it's
my turn now, okay?

19:49.146 --> 19:51.273
You have to answer
one question on the record.

19:51.357 --> 19:53.817
- So official.
- Thank you.

19:53.901 --> 19:55.277
All right, why'd
you become a cop?

19:55.361 --> 19:56.862
- Really?
- I like to take

19:56.946 --> 19:58.238
my interviewees
off-guard.

19:58.322 --> 20:00.156
You like to suck up
to your interviewees

20:00.241 --> 20:01.741
so you get
more information out of 'em.

20:01.826 --> 20:06.204
Gosh, you're so smart.

20:06.289 --> 20:08.039
When I was a kid,
I wanted to be a vet,

20:08.124 --> 20:11.459
and I volunteered
at this animal shelter.

20:11.544 --> 20:15.213
I'd see the animals come in
burned, tortured, mutilated.

20:15.298 --> 20:18.008
I got less interested
in treating the animals

20:18.092 --> 20:21.261
and more interested in catching
the animals who did that to 'em.

20:23.222 --> 20:25.807
You volunteered
at an animal shelter.

20:27.101 --> 20:28.435
Don't tell anyone.

20:29.520 --> 20:30.729
I won't.

20:30.813 --> 20:32.647
Your secret
is safe with me.

20:32.732 --> 20:34.482
Even in Wind Gap.

20:36.360 --> 20:39.654
So, for various
reasons, this...

20:40.948 --> 20:44.075
is what they call
"the end zone."

20:44.160 --> 20:46.328
Double entendre
intended.

20:46.412 --> 20:48.455
This is where the football team
would have their way

20:48.539 --> 20:49.831
with that week's
lucky cheerleader.

20:49.916 --> 20:51.541
- Ninth grade, you said.
- Yep.

20:51.626 --> 20:53.960
Makes me sick.

20:54.045 --> 20:56.922
- Were the police notified?
- Of course not.

20:59.008 --> 21:00.717
Some people would
call that rape, you know.

21:00.801 --> 21:01.927
Eh, some people
would call that

21:02.011 --> 21:03.887
consensual, you know?

21:03.971 --> 21:05.805
Wait, who are you
talking about?

21:05.890 --> 21:07.307
Were you one of the girls?

21:07.391 --> 21:08.808
If I say yes, you'll think

21:08.893 --> 21:10.644
less of me, or you'll
feel sorry for me.

21:10.728 --> 21:12.729
No, I'd think those guys
took advantage of someone

21:12.813 --> 21:14.606
way too young to make
an informed decision.

21:14.690 --> 21:15.941
- Typical.
- What?

21:16.025 --> 21:17.984
Well, a boy has sex
with five girls,

21:18.069 --> 21:19.986
they're gonna put up
a statue in his honor.

21:20.071 --> 21:22.572
- You know? Yeah.
- Yeah, double standards exist.

21:22.657 --> 21:24.699
But having your way
with somebody,

21:24.784 --> 21:26.368
that sounds criminal.
Literally.

21:26.452 --> 21:28.453
Even on game night.

21:28.537 --> 21:29.621
But now that I know
your feeling

21:29.705 --> 21:33.124
on the subject,
have a sip.

21:35.294 --> 21:36.878
Bless your heart.

21:36.963 --> 21:38.338
Bless your heart
very much.

21:38.422 --> 21:42.175
What's your
second question?

21:42.259 --> 21:45.303
That tire sample that you
took off of Bob Nash's car,

21:45.388 --> 21:47.514
- Yeah?
- where was the tread?

21:47.598 --> 21:49.516
- Did it match?
- That's two questions.

21:49.600 --> 21:50.934
That's a two-part question.

21:51.018 --> 21:53.019
Give me that.

21:55.314 --> 21:56.439
You know
it wasn't a match.

21:56.524 --> 21:58.108
Well, that kind of
blows up my

21:58.192 --> 22:00.402
Bob Nash-killed-
Natalie Keene

22:00.486 --> 22:01.695
in-revenge-for-Anne
theory.

22:01.779 --> 22:02.821
You think
there's two killers,

22:02.905 --> 22:05.073
and Bob Nash
killed Natalie Keene?

22:05.157 --> 22:07.283
That's a two-part question.

22:07.368 --> 22:09.953
Um, I mean,

22:10.037 --> 22:11.287
the teeth pulling matches,

22:11.372 --> 22:13.373
but that could be a cover-up.

22:13.457 --> 22:14.791
They were killed differently,

22:14.875 --> 22:16.376
and one of the bodies
was hidden,

22:16.460 --> 22:17.627
and the other
was put on display

22:17.712 --> 22:18.878
for the whole town
to see, like,

22:18.963 --> 22:20.547
"Fuck you, Wind Gap,
look what I can do."

22:20.631 --> 22:23.258
Mm, that's
an interesting theory,

22:23.342 --> 22:25.301
but Nash's alibi
checks out so far.

22:25.386 --> 22:27.220
Yeah, well, a lot of women
think Nash is a pervert,

22:27.304 --> 22:29.014
and sometimes perverts
like little girls.

22:29.098 --> 22:30.807
That's where
the teeth pulling comes in.

22:30.891 --> 22:34.185
In our guy's mind,
it's equivalent to rape.

22:34.270 --> 22:36.021
It's about power...

22:36.105 --> 22:38.231
for someone who
feels powerless.

22:54.707 --> 22:55.915
Stay.

23:12.683 --> 23:14.517
Hello, Amma.

23:14.602 --> 23:16.019
Did you catch
the killer yet?

23:17.229 --> 23:18.521
Is your mama home?

23:18.606 --> 23:20.440
You didn't?
Shouldn't, uh,

23:20.524 --> 23:23.068
you be out there
looking for him?

23:23.152 --> 23:24.694
Well, you're certainly
your mama's daughter--

23:24.779 --> 23:25.904
I'll give you that.

23:25.988 --> 23:27.614
Is there a problem, Chief?

23:27.698 --> 23:31.076
Oh, I just came by
to discuss something with Adora.

23:31.160 --> 23:33.703
She's in bed, resting.

23:38.000 --> 23:41.086
Mama, Chief Vickery's here.

23:41.170 --> 23:44.297
Oh...

23:44.381 --> 23:47.383
Is everything okay?

23:47.468 --> 23:52.055
Yes. I was just hoping
you and I could have a word.

23:52.139 --> 23:54.808
Of course.
Give me a moment

23:54.892 --> 23:56.142
to put myself together.

23:56.227 --> 23:57.685
Uh, Alan,

23:57.770 --> 24:00.522
please fix
the Chief a drink.

24:00.606 --> 24:02.315
Gayla?

24:02.399 --> 24:04.984
Well, I assume
you'll have the usual.

24:05.069 --> 24:07.654
Mm-hmm.

24:07.738 --> 24:09.531
Take a seat.

24:18.249 --> 24:20.208
This place
I already know about.

24:20.292 --> 24:23.419
Ann and Natalie
used to play here.

24:38.602 --> 24:42.021
Creepy place for two
young girls to hang out.

24:43.607 --> 24:45.859
No?

24:45.943 --> 24:47.527
Yeah.

24:55.619 --> 24:57.036
The way these killings
went down,

24:57.121 --> 24:58.830
it makes sense they knew
their attacker, right?

24:58.914 --> 25:00.165
I'm certain of it.

25:00.249 --> 25:01.416
Certain? Why?

25:01.500 --> 25:02.792
This guy's a hunter.

25:02.877 --> 25:04.294
Hunters track their prey.

25:04.378 --> 25:06.337
Where do they lead to?
A clearing.

25:06.422 --> 25:08.214
This shed.

25:08.299 --> 25:10.175
It's no coincidence
that the only two girls

25:10.259 --> 25:12.343
that were killed in this town
used to play here.

25:12.428 --> 25:14.429
He probably
hid out there

25:14.513 --> 25:16.514
waiting for them,
watching them.

25:16.599 --> 25:18.308
Waiting for one
to arrive before the other

25:18.392 --> 25:21.019
so they'd be alone,
and then-- then he struck.

25:21.103 --> 25:23.438
Well, I thought that Ann
was taken from her bike.

25:23.522 --> 25:25.231
That's what they said,
but they never found it,

25:25.316 --> 25:27.442
so could've happened here.

25:27.526 --> 25:28.651
Well, that's an
interesting theory,

25:28.736 --> 25:29.819
but there's
no proof of that.

25:29.904 --> 25:31.821
No, but I'm getting close.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.656
Someone in this town
is hiding something.

25:37.119 --> 25:39.662
What makes you say that?

25:39.747 --> 25:42.457
People are getting nervous.

25:42.541 --> 25:44.042
Oh.

25:47.087 --> 25:49.088
Did something happen
to you in that shed?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.801
Good instincts, KC.

25:53.886 --> 25:55.470
You holding out on me?

25:55.554 --> 25:56.888
I might be.

25:59.141 --> 26:00.266
And I was under
the impression

26:00.351 --> 26:02.560
you were starting
to like me.

26:12.446 --> 26:13.655
No.

26:47.648 --> 26:49.357
How's your hand, dear?

26:49.441 --> 26:51.276
- Better, thank you.
- Oh, good.

26:57.408 --> 26:58.700
Mm.

26:59.702 --> 27:00.702
Ow.

27:00.786 --> 27:02.662
The roses.

27:05.833 --> 27:07.041
If you'll excuse me.

27:15.301 --> 27:17.302
How's Jocelyn?

27:18.804 --> 27:20.513
Fine.

27:20.597 --> 27:22.098
Sends her love.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.475
Well, that's sweet.
Send it back, of course.

27:24.560 --> 27:25.935
Of course.

27:28.689 --> 27:29.981
Is there a break
in the case?

27:30.065 --> 27:33.651
You'd be the first to know.

27:33.736 --> 27:36.904
- However--
- Ah, the "however."

27:36.989 --> 27:39.615
Mm. Calhoun Day, Adora.

27:39.700 --> 27:42.327
It's not appropriate
given the events.

27:42.411 --> 27:43.911
Mm-mm.

27:43.996 --> 27:45.955
I think the town needs
a bit of frivolity,

27:46.040 --> 27:47.874
don't you think,
given the events?

27:50.461 --> 27:51.919
Possibly.

27:52.004 --> 27:53.588
Then why would you
have me cancel an event

27:53.672 --> 27:55.089
that's been a part
of this town

27:55.174 --> 27:57.633
for half a century?

27:59.011 --> 28:01.012
Because I haven't
caught the killer.

28:01.096 --> 28:03.306
Ahh.

28:06.477 --> 28:10.229
Well, you do have
the power as chief,

28:10.314 --> 28:12.231
to do whatever's
in the interest

28:12.316 --> 28:13.775
of public safety.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.360
I do.

28:17.821 --> 28:21.866
And some have the power
in this town...

28:21.950 --> 28:24.077
to remove you as chief.

28:34.505 --> 28:37.215
Oh, that's what I love
about you, Adora.

28:37.299 --> 28:41.344
You never pull
your punches.

28:41.428 --> 28:43.429
That's the only thing?

28:46.225 --> 28:49.060
We need to talk
about your daughters.

28:49.144 --> 28:51.646
What about them?

28:51.730 --> 28:54.607
Well, one of them
is dangerous,

28:54.691 --> 28:57.151
and the other one's
in danger.

29:03.909 --> 29:06.452
I'm working on some things.

29:06.537 --> 29:09.247
Any "some thing"
you'd like to share?

29:10.374 --> 29:11.666
The girls were dead

29:11.750 --> 29:13.042
when their teeth
were pulled, right?

29:13.127 --> 29:14.794
Yeah, that's enough questions.

29:14.878 --> 29:18.631
One more.
What about John Keene?

29:18.715 --> 29:20.967
He seems, maybe,
too broken up

29:21.051 --> 29:22.885
over the whole thing--
could be an act.

29:22.970 --> 29:24.512
Well, his sister
was murdered.

29:24.596 --> 29:26.806
Yeah, but I'm a guy,
and teenage boys,

29:26.890 --> 29:30.059
they would sooner die
than cry in public.

29:30.144 --> 29:32.770
Oh, look who's here.

29:39.236 --> 29:40.361
Everything okay?

29:40.446 --> 29:42.280
Kansas City.

29:42.364 --> 29:43.489
Miss Preaker.

29:44.950 --> 29:46.909
No need for alarm.
Just a friendly house visit.

29:46.994 --> 29:49.287
Yeah. I'd like
to hear all about

29:49.371 --> 29:50.872
your conversation
later on.

29:50.956 --> 29:55.334
And I yours.
Good night.

30:07.014 --> 30:09.932
What was that
all about?

30:10.017 --> 30:13.352
Small town cop,
big time problems.

30:25.115 --> 30:27.366
Now we kiss?

30:27.451 --> 30:29.368
I'm an unconventional girl.

30:29.453 --> 30:30.995
That's what you
like about me.

31:55.205 --> 31:56.539
Shit.
I'm sorry, Mama.

31:56.623 --> 31:58.541
You just scared me.
Sorry.

31:58.625 --> 32:00.751
I... I couldn't sleep

32:00.836 --> 32:02.920
with everything that's
going on around here.

32:03.005 --> 32:05.214
Yeah, well...

32:05.299 --> 32:06.632
You don't need
to worry about me.

32:06.717 --> 32:07.883
I'm okay.

32:11.013 --> 32:12.221
Okay.

32:12.306 --> 32:15.266
How was La Mere?

32:15.350 --> 32:17.351
Um, it was good.

32:17.436 --> 32:19.562
The ladies
were disappointed

32:19.646 --> 32:20.938
that you didn't come.

32:21.023 --> 32:24.775
You were always
so willful.

32:24.860 --> 32:27.612
Excuse me?

32:27.696 --> 32:29.363
Never sweet.

32:30.949 --> 32:35.369
I-I remember when you
were about six or seven.

32:35.454 --> 32:38.331
I wanted to put
your hair up in curlers

32:38.415 --> 32:39.832
for your school picture.

32:41.376 --> 32:44.629
Instead, you cut it all off
with my fabric shears.

32:44.713 --> 32:47.214
No.

32:47.299 --> 32:48.883
No, no, no, Mama.
That wasn't me.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.134
- I think you're--
- When I was expecting

32:50.218 --> 32:52.595
with you, I thought
you'd save me.

32:56.350 --> 32:59.935
I thought you'd love me,

33:00.020 --> 33:02.271
and then my...

33:02.356 --> 33:06.150
my mother would love me.

33:08.028 --> 33:11.072
Even from the beginning,
you disobeyed.

33:11.156 --> 33:12.573
You wouldn't--
wouldn't eat,

33:12.658 --> 33:15.826
like-- like you were

33:15.911 --> 33:18.162
punishing me
for being born.

33:19.831 --> 33:22.625
You made me

33:22.709 --> 33:24.710
feel like a fool,

33:24.795 --> 33:27.505
like a...

33:27.589 --> 33:29.799
like a child.

33:30.926 --> 33:32.635
You were a child.

33:41.269 --> 33:43.270
And now you
come back here...

33:52.280 --> 33:56.909
...and all
I can think is...

33:56.993 --> 34:00.996
What? What, Mama?

34:05.585 --> 34:07.586
You smell ripe.

34:29.276 --> 34:31.277
You gonna finish soon?

34:36.324 --> 34:37.408
Wait, what are you doing?

34:37.492 --> 34:38.909
I'm gonna go
for a ride.

34:40.662 --> 34:42.288
I'll let you put it inside me.

35:06.354 --> 35:08.355
Can I get you anything else,
Miss Camille?

35:08.440 --> 35:09.899
No, thank you.

35:11.693 --> 35:14.612
Gayla, all these years...

35:14.696 --> 35:18.574
We both know how Adora is.

35:18.658 --> 35:20.951
Why did you stay?

35:21.036 --> 35:23.120
Not a lot of choice
in Wind Gap.

35:23.205 --> 35:25.581
You got domestic work.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.416
You got the hog farm.

35:27.501 --> 35:29.460
I don't like pigs.

35:29.544 --> 35:31.587
Besides...

35:31.671 --> 35:34.048
Miss Crellin's bark
is worse than her bite.

35:35.342 --> 35:38.260
They're both pretty bad
if you ask me.

35:38.345 --> 35:40.012
Good night,
Miss Camille.

37:09.394 --> 37:11.061
I'm glad to see that

37:11.146 --> 37:13.397
that hand of yours
is doing better.

37:13.481 --> 37:14.899
- Me, too.
- Yeah.

37:21.907 --> 37:26.160
I was just wondering
if you needed me

37:26.244 --> 37:28.913
for anything
else tonight.

37:33.835 --> 37:36.420
I can't think
of anything.

37:36.504 --> 37:39.757
You know, I lost
a daughter, too.

37:39.841 --> 37:42.927
What are you saying?

37:43.011 --> 37:47.222
I don't think that you've
ever stopped to consider that.

37:51.144 --> 37:52.394
It's late.

37:52.479 --> 37:55.648
Marian was taken
from me, too, Adora,

37:55.732 --> 37:58.692
and I would just like
to see some appreciation

37:58.777 --> 38:00.486
for how I have borne that.

38:00.570 --> 38:01.695
What you're saying--

38:01.780 --> 38:03.322
What do you
want me to say?

38:03.406 --> 38:04.823
Thank you?

38:04.908 --> 38:07.076
Nobody asked you
to suffer in silence.

38:07.160 --> 38:10.162
How is it that you
show more compassion

38:10.246 --> 38:11.622
for the local
civil servants

38:11.706 --> 38:13.123
than for your
own husband?

38:13.208 --> 38:14.249
How is that?

38:20.173 --> 38:22.257
If you are speaking
about the Chief,

38:22.342 --> 38:24.885
I am-- I am done
with this conversation.

38:24.970 --> 38:26.887
Hmm. Seemed to me

38:26.972 --> 38:29.431
you could talk
to him all night.

38:29.516 --> 38:30.849
It's Camille,

38:30.934 --> 38:32.142
- isn't it?
- Oh, come on, now.

38:32.227 --> 38:34.561
She brings discord
into this house.

38:34.646 --> 38:36.605
Not everything
is that girl's fault,

38:36.690 --> 38:38.315
and you know it.

38:38.400 --> 38:40.985
Why are you
trying to hurt me?

38:41.069 --> 38:44.321
Hurt?

38:44.406 --> 38:48.367
You have a very peculiar idea

38:48.451 --> 38:50.452
of the word, "hurt," dear.

38:59.838 --> 39:01.296
Stay.

39:03.717 --> 39:07.344
Vickery, Jocelyn know
that you're out

39:07.429 --> 39:09.221
calling on another woman
late at night?

39:09.305 --> 39:13.892
Not if you don't tell her.

39:13.977 --> 39:15.561
I need you help.

39:17.147 --> 39:18.522
Okay.

39:18.606 --> 39:20.774
What is Adora
not telling me

39:20.859 --> 39:22.359
about the Preaker girl?

39:27.741 --> 39:30.743
I don't know what
you're talking about.

40:15.872 --> 40:18.415
Can I have two
of those? Thanks.

40:25.590 --> 40:27.132
Thank you.

40:27.217 --> 40:29.384
Oh, these are, uh,
both mine, actually.

40:29.469 --> 40:32.471
- Oh.
- I'm kidding.

40:32.555 --> 40:34.139
I could totally
two-fist it right now.

40:35.558 --> 40:36.683
Bad day?

40:36.768 --> 40:38.102
Yeah, my mom is--

40:38.186 --> 40:40.854
My mom is losing it.

40:40.939 --> 40:42.940
And your mom had me
fired from my job today.

40:43.024 --> 40:44.733
My mom fired you.

40:44.818 --> 40:46.068
It's okay.

40:46.152 --> 40:49.321
It's not really
a fun place to work.

40:49.405 --> 40:51.490
Pigs are smart, you know?

40:51.574 --> 40:53.492
They know what's
happening to them.

40:53.576 --> 40:57.996
Or... what's
about to happen.

40:58.081 --> 41:00.374
That's why they
shit so much.

41:00.458 --> 41:02.334
'Cause they're afraid.

41:07.298 --> 41:09.174
Do you ever
get over it?

41:09.259 --> 41:11.468
- Losing a job?
- Losing a sister.

41:15.223 --> 41:16.515
I wish I could
tell you "yes",

41:16.599 --> 41:18.016
but that would be a lie.

41:21.104 --> 41:22.688
People in this town
actually believe

41:22.772 --> 41:23.939
that I killed her.

41:24.023 --> 41:25.399
Yeah, I know.

41:25.483 --> 41:27.526
If it means anything
to you, I don't.

41:48.631 --> 41:53.135
Natalie collected spiders.
Did you know that?

41:53.219 --> 41:55.220
No.

41:58.892 --> 42:01.185
She got into some trouble
back in Philly.

42:01.269 --> 42:03.937
That's where we
used to live.

42:04.022 --> 42:07.274
What kind of trouble,
if you don't mind me asking?

42:07.358 --> 42:10.611
She got mad at a girl
for stealing her pencil.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.657
So, she took it back
from her and, uh...

42:18.453 --> 42:19.828
...she stuck it
in her eye.

42:19.913 --> 42:21.872
Jesus.

42:21.956 --> 42:23.749
Please, do not put
that in your story.

42:23.833 --> 42:25.500
I've never told this
to anyone before.

42:25.585 --> 42:27.961
I won't.

42:33.051 --> 42:34.718
Bob always thought
Ann was on the--

42:34.802 --> 42:36.261
the straight-and-narrow path

42:36.346 --> 42:40.682
before she met Natalie--
the "devil child."

42:40.767 --> 42:43.310
That's what he
used to call her.

42:47.273 --> 42:49.233
I think they were
two peas in a pod,

42:49.317 --> 42:52.319
those two--
those two weirdos.

42:52.403 --> 42:56.865
Nothing wrong with that.
I'm a weirdo.

42:56.950 --> 42:58.575
Yeah, me, too, I guess.

43:00.578 --> 43:01.870
I always thought
those girls

43:01.955 --> 43:03.413
were gonna end up
killing each other.

43:03.498 --> 43:06.041
They were always
going at it.

43:06.125 --> 43:08.460
Amma was the only thing that
stood between them some days.

43:08.544 --> 43:10.712
Amma?

43:10.797 --> 43:13.173
Yeah. Yeah, she was always
keeping 'em off each other.

43:16.219 --> 43:17.886
I knew that Adora
tutored the girls,

43:17.971 --> 43:21.056
but I didn't know that
Amma was close with them.

43:21.140 --> 43:23.016
Oh, yeah.

43:23.101 --> 43:24.935
I guess the three
would all go play

43:25.019 --> 43:26.436
in that creepy
hunting shed.

43:29.732 --> 43:31.149
You okay?

44:08.229 --> 44:10.647
Fuck, dude!

44:33.921 --> 44:35.130
Fuck.
