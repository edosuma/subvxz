WEBVTT

00:03.084 --> 00:05.752
We are being watched.

00:05.754 --> 00:07.887
The government
has a secret system--

00:07.889 --> 00:12.325
a Machine that spies on you
every hour of every day.

00:12.327 --> 00:14.894
I designed the Machine
to detect acts of terror,

00:14.896 --> 00:16.696
but it sees everything...

00:16.698 --> 00:20.099
Violent crimes
involving ordinary people.

00:20.101 --> 00:23.002
The government considers
these people irrelevant.

00:23.004 --> 00:25.204
We don't.

00:25.206 --> 00:29.709
Hunted by the authorities,
we work in secret.

00:29.711 --> 00:31.444
You will never find us.

00:31.446 --> 00:33.745
But victim or perpetrator,

00:33.747 --> 00:36.782
if your number's up,
we'll find you.

00:36.783 --> 00:39.952
Sync and corrections by n17t01
www.addic7ed.com

00:46.093 --> 00:47.493
Any word from Root?

00:50.296 --> 00:52.064
And no new leads on Shaw.

00:56.603 --> 00:58.670
Any progress on the
backlog of numbers we missed

00:58.672 --> 01:01.607
when Samaritan went
on the offensive?

01:01.609 --> 01:04.375
The ones I've looked
into are already dead

01:04.376 --> 01:07.645
or locked up for the crimes
we failed to prevent.

01:07.647 --> 01:09.447
Me, too, but I found three

01:09.449 --> 01:12.117
that are open
missing persons cases.

01:12.119 --> 01:13.618
All three went missing
during the same

01:13.620 --> 01:15.520
48-hour period.

01:15.522 --> 01:17.589
I'm trying to find out
if they might be connected.

01:17.591 --> 01:18.856
Or still alive.

01:18.858 --> 01:20.158
I'll do what I can to assist,

01:20.160 --> 01:21.592
but I'm afraid the
unfortunate facts

01:21.594 --> 01:22.827
of having a real life

01:22.829 --> 01:25.997
have finally caught up to me.

01:25.999 --> 01:29.333
Professor Whistler
has jury duty,

01:29.335 --> 01:31.736
and I can't ignore it
for fear of attracting

01:31.738 --> 01:34.639
unwanted attention
to my cover identity.

01:34.641 --> 01:36.173
You just have to try
to get out of it

01:36.175 --> 01:37.574
like everybody else.

01:37.576 --> 01:39.976
And if I'm stuck on a jury

01:39.978 --> 01:41.512
when the next number comes up?

01:41.514 --> 01:43.313
Fusco and I can handle it.

01:43.315 --> 01:44.814
Now, about that,

01:44.816 --> 01:46.550
after everything
that's happened...

01:47.918 --> 01:49.520
Perhaps it would be
best if we left him

01:49.522 --> 01:52.356
out of our operations for now.

01:52.358 --> 01:54.057
When we started, you told me

01:54.059 --> 01:55.959
we'd both wind up dead.

01:57.161 --> 01:59.696
This is worse.

01:59.698 --> 02:01.564
You're right.

02:01.566 --> 02:03.900
If we're short-handed,
we're short-handed.

02:06.103 --> 02:08.705
We're not bringing
anyone else into this.

02:12.609 --> 02:14.610
It's just you and me
again, Mr. Reese.

<i>I don't care if I have
bad reception, Terrence.</i>

02:28.492 --> 02:30.092
We're rolling calls.

02:30.094 --> 02:32.761
Now get me on with Anton.

02:32.763 --> 02:35.130
We better be out of here
by Friday night, you know.

02:35.132 --> 02:37.166
I got courtside Knicks tickets.

02:39.069 --> 02:41.503
Grading exams.

02:41.505 --> 02:42.938
Where do you teach?

02:42.940 --> 02:46.241
Oh, at a local college.

02:46.243 --> 02:47.809
I was a high school
English teacher

02:47.811 --> 02:50.445
for 41 years,
but budget cuts--

02:50.447 --> 02:52.780
I was pushed into retirement.

02:52.782 --> 02:54.048
I miss the students.

02:54.050 --> 02:55.417
Well, some of them,
but, you know,

02:55.419 --> 02:56.918
I have a lot more
free time now.

02:56.920 --> 02:58.220
I'm actually learning to knit.

02:58.222 --> 02:59.454
Indeed.

02:59.456 --> 03:00.822
Well, if you'll forgive me,

03:00.824 --> 03:03.791
I really should focus
on some work.

03:03.793 --> 03:05.059
Oh, you're computerized.

03:05.061 --> 03:06.393
Now, that's great.

03:06.395 --> 03:08.062
In public school, we barely had

03:08.064 --> 03:09.697
enough money for
books and teachers,

03:09.699 --> 03:12.499
let alone fancy laptops.

03:12.501 --> 03:14.001
<i>What in the... Oh!</i>

03:14.003 --> 03:15.937
<i>Okay, next group.</i>

03:15.939 --> 03:17.137
Oh, dear. Oh, dear.

03:17.139 --> 03:18.505
<i>Paladino, Mel.</i>

03:18.507 --> 03:22.008
<i>Everts, Riva.</i>
<i>McDermott, Doug.</i>

03:22.010 --> 03:23.244
<i>Whistler, Harold.</i>

03:23.246 --> 03:25.011
Oh...

03:25.013 --> 03:26.580
<i>Rollins, Timothy.</i>

03:26.582 --> 03:27.781
<i>Blake, Emma.</i>

03:27.783 --> 03:29.149
Oh, that's me.

03:29.151 --> 03:32.018
I'm-- I'm Emma,
by the way.

03:33.121 --> 03:34.420
Harold.

03:34.422 --> 03:35.455
Well, at least we'll both

03:35.457 --> 03:36.656
have a friend in there, huh?

03:39.961 --> 03:42.028
<i>I need to be excused
due to financial hardship.</i>

03:42.030 --> 03:44.597
I am negotiating a
multimillion dollar deal.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.332
You'll be compensated
for your time.

03:46.334 --> 03:47.934
$40 a day.

03:47.936 --> 03:49.169
I hate cops.

03:49.171 --> 03:50.503
All cops.

03:50.505 --> 03:52.204
I'd never believe
anything a cop said.

03:52.206 --> 03:55.007
Just like I don't believe
what you're saying now.

03:55.009 --> 03:56.643
Nice try, Mr. Rollins.

03:56.645 --> 03:58.278
I don't really follow the news,

03:58.280 --> 04:00.179
so I guess I don't
have an opinion

04:00.181 --> 04:01.481
one way or the other.

04:01.483 --> 04:02.782
No challenge, your honor.

04:02.784 --> 04:04.350
No challenge.

04:04.352 --> 04:05.685
No, I can't think of anything

04:05.687 --> 04:08.654
that would prejudice me
in this case.

04:08.656 --> 04:11.824
I mean, except for the larger
issues with our government.

04:11.826 --> 04:13.125
Issues?

04:13.127 --> 04:14.760
Well, one can't really call it

04:14.762 --> 04:16.560
government of the people
by the people

04:16.563 --> 04:17.728
anymore, can one?

04:19.132 --> 04:22.234
Because we're all being watched

04:22.236 --> 04:24.135
by an intelligent supercomputer

04:24.137 --> 04:27.038
that's slowly but surely
taking over the world.

04:30.142 --> 04:33.412
You can return to your seat
in the gallery, Mr. Whistler.

04:33.414 --> 04:35.547
That's Professor
Whistler, actually.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.985
<i>Okay, that's our jury.</i>

04:40.987 --> 04:42.687
<i>The rest of you are free to go.</i>

04:44.424 --> 04:45.990
<i>What did I say</i>
<i>about cell phones?</i>

04:45.992 --> 04:47.758
<i>Zero tolerance.</i>

04:47.760 --> 04:49.527
You are held in contempt.

04:49.529 --> 04:51.762
What?
No, I-- I swear it was off.

04:51.764 --> 04:53.364
<i>That's not even my ringtone.</i>

04:53.366 --> 04:56.967
It seems we have
a seat to fill.

04:56.969 --> 05:00.871
Professor Whistler,
your number's up.

05:17.388 --> 05:18.956
When I said I was
looking forward

05:18.958 --> 05:21.158
to our next session,
John, I didn't expect you

05:21.160 --> 05:24.161
to make me wait so long.

05:24.163 --> 05:26.529
Is that your way of saying
you missed me, Iris?

05:27.833 --> 05:29.332
It's my way of saying

05:29.334 --> 05:31.534
you're not supposed to
cancel mandatory sessions.

05:31.536 --> 05:33.370
Well, they didn't give
me mandatory sessions

05:33.372 --> 05:35.805
'cause I'm good
at following rules.

05:35.807 --> 05:38.241
Captain Moreno said
you took unpaid leave.

05:40.544 --> 05:44.213
There was a death
in the family.

05:44.215 --> 05:45.848
I'm sorry to hear that.

05:47.851 --> 05:49.518
Do you want to talk about it?

05:53.523 --> 05:54.857
Okay.

05:57.327 --> 05:58.928
Then onto the good news.

05:58.930 --> 06:00.196
This is your last session.

06:00.198 --> 06:01.463
I'm signing off on you.

06:01.465 --> 06:03.632
<i>Congratulations.</i>

06:03.634 --> 06:07.102
You're sane, or close enough.

06:07.104 --> 06:08.303
And you're free to go.

06:09.839 --> 06:12.207
Okay.

06:12.209 --> 06:13.375
Well...

06:16.212 --> 06:17.245
Thanks for everything.

06:17.247 --> 06:18.446
Mm-hmm.

06:22.719 --> 06:23.885
I'm sorry.

06:36.365 --> 06:38.165
Missing persons?

06:39.935 --> 06:42.136
You lost, Lionel?

06:42.138 --> 06:43.704
What's the deal
with these three?

06:43.706 --> 06:46.974
The deal is they're
on my desk, not yours.

06:46.976 --> 06:48.810
Well, they're not homicides,
so I was guessing

06:48.812 --> 06:51.211
it's part of our
little side project.

06:51.213 --> 06:54.281
Actually, we're putting
that on hold for a while.

06:54.283 --> 06:56.850
When I need your help,
I'll let you know.

07:16.671 --> 07:18.738
<i>Sierra... Close...</i>

07:18.740 --> 07:23.677
Someday soon, your phone
will have a little "5K"

07:23.679 --> 07:27.680
on its screen-- a fifth
generation wireless technology

07:27.682 --> 07:30.416
<i>that will make it run faster</i>
<i>and work better,</i>

07:30.418 --> 07:35.521
and that 5K will be there
because of Caroline Mills,

07:35.523 --> 07:39.558
the hard-working CEO of a major
telecommunications firm

07:39.560 --> 07:42.160
who was gunned down
in her own home

07:42.162 --> 07:46.264
by her own husband,
Chad Bryson.

07:46.266 --> 07:51.136
See, Caroline was about
to earn her company billions,

07:51.138 --> 07:53.939
and you are going to hear
from witness after witness

07:53.941 --> 07:58.176
who will tell you that Chad,
a failed entrepreneur,

07:58.178 --> 08:00.178
<i>couldn't handle</i>
<i>his wife's success,</i>

08:00.180 --> 08:01.713
that their marriage
was on the rocks,

08:01.715 --> 08:04.316
and that,
out of jealousy and greed,

08:04.318 --> 08:09.187
Chad Bryson chose to kill
his wife, Caroline,

08:09.189 --> 08:12.824
rather than risk being left
with nothing.

08:12.826 --> 08:15.192
<i>Finch, we just
got another number.</i>

08:15.194 --> 08:17.795
I'm a touch busy at the moment.

08:17.797 --> 08:19.363
<i>Yeah, but I think the Machine</i>

08:19.365 --> 08:21.065
<i>wants you to handle</i>
<i>this one personally.</i>

08:21.067 --> 08:23.134
How can you possibly know that?

08:23.136 --> 08:25.202
<i>Because I just
tracked down our new number,</i>

08:25.204 --> 08:27.171
<i>and she's sitting</i>
<i>right next to you.</i>

08:49.396 --> 08:51.931
Well, I spent last night
digging through Emma's

08:51.933 --> 08:53.232
<i>digital footprint.</i>

08:53.234 --> 08:55.234
You find anything interesting?

08:55.236 --> 08:58.404
Nothing that she hadn't
already told me yesterday.

08:58.406 --> 09:00.205
She taught high school English

09:00.207 --> 09:03.742
<i>for 41 years and then</i>
<i>was forced into retirement.</i>

09:03.744 --> 09:06.378
Although prescriptions
for anti-depressants

09:06.380 --> 09:08.414
and appointments
with a psychiatrist

09:08.416 --> 09:11.082
suggest that she's
not happily retired.

09:11.084 --> 09:13.885
Nothing wrong with getting
a little help, Finch.

09:13.887 --> 09:15.353
Certainly not.

09:15.355 --> 09:16.888
I just can't find any clues

09:16.890 --> 09:19.323
as to why she needs our help.

09:19.325 --> 09:21.325
<i>Which means that</i>
<i>whatever's going on,</i>

09:21.327 --> 09:24.663
<i>it's probably about this trial.</i>

09:24.665 --> 09:26.731
Might explain why she
has enough press clippings

09:26.733 --> 09:29.167
about this case
to wallpaper an asylum.

09:29.169 --> 09:32.570
Yesterday, she denied
knowing anything about it.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.205
Telling them what
they want to hear

09:34.207 --> 09:36.174
to get herself on that jury.

09:36.176 --> 09:37.942
Looks like she's obsessed.

09:37.944 --> 09:39.243
Perhaps she's trying

09:39.245 --> 09:41.479
to get close enough
to kill Chad.

09:41.481 --> 09:43.781
<i>Or maybe she's
one of those nutballs</i>

09:43.783 --> 09:45.449
who falls in love
with a killer,

09:45.451 --> 09:47.851
and she's after the prosecutors
trying to put him away.

09:47.853 --> 09:50.387
Either way, she may
be our perpetrator.

09:50.389 --> 09:52.756
Try to find out what
she's planning, Mr. Reese.

09:52.758 --> 09:54.324
<i>I'll keep an eye on her here.</i>

09:57.128 --> 09:59.897
Oh, hi, neighbor.

10:01.133 --> 10:02.332
Well.

10:12.143 --> 10:13.943
<i>Okay, Emma.</i>

10:13.945 --> 10:16.279
Bought any good
murder weapons lately?

10:18.950 --> 10:21.084
Kind of busy, Lionel.

10:21.086 --> 10:22.919
Yeah, I figured that when you didn't
show up for work this morning,

10:22.921 --> 10:24.654
so I thought I'd lend a hand.

10:24.656 --> 10:26.656
<i>I'm trying to track down</i>
<i>your missing three.</i>

10:26.658 --> 10:27.991
<i>Didn't I tell you
to leave that alone?</i>

10:27.993 --> 10:29.291
You're not the only
one who can pull

10:29.293 --> 10:30.559
a missing person's
file, smart guy.

10:30.561 --> 10:31.961
One of your three,
his cell signal

10:31.963 --> 10:33.862
vanished in the
armpit of Queens.

10:33.864 --> 10:35.297
<i>I don't have a body,</i>

10:35.299 --> 10:36.432
but there's a bar near here,

10:36.434 --> 10:38.134
until recently,
belonged to Elias.

10:38.136 --> 10:40.503
Damn it, Lionel.

10:40.505 --> 10:42.238
<i>So I'm thinking maybe</i>

10:42.240 --> 10:44.206
<i>your missing person</i>
<i>used to do business with Elias.</i>

10:44.208 --> 10:46.442
Lionel...

10:46.444 --> 10:48.344
I said I could handle it.

10:48.346 --> 10:50.578
Just stay out
of this one, okay?

10:51.648 --> 10:52.881
Yeah.

11:04.527 --> 11:06.194
John!

11:06.196 --> 11:08.196
Please tell me you didn't
just shoot someone else.

11:08.198 --> 11:09.797
Not yet.

11:09.799 --> 11:13.168
But I was...

11:13.170 --> 11:17.872
I thought maybe we
could keep talking.

11:19.475 --> 11:21.209
Of course.

11:21.211 --> 11:22.544
About what?

11:22.546 --> 11:24.078
About...

11:27.615 --> 11:29.550
things that have happened.

11:29.552 --> 11:31.285
Regular sessions.

11:31.287 --> 11:33.721
I'd be happy to.

11:33.723 --> 11:35.156
But you should know
this will be more

11:35.158 --> 11:36.323
than a quick chat to make sure

11:36.325 --> 11:37.825
you're not about to snap.

11:37.827 --> 11:40.227
I'll be asking you some
pretty tough questions.

11:41.663 --> 11:42.663
Like what?

11:42.665 --> 11:44.231
Like who are you, really?

11:44.233 --> 11:47.133
Because you're not a cop.

11:47.135 --> 11:49.536
My dad, three
brothers, an uncle,

11:49.538 --> 11:51.705
and two of my aunts...
all police.

11:51.707 --> 11:53.473
I've been around cops
my whole life,

11:53.475 --> 11:55.775
and you, my friend,
are not a cop.

11:58.079 --> 11:59.679
So how did John Reilly wind up

11:59.681 --> 12:02.148
working for the NYPD?

12:06.220 --> 12:08.588
Does 9:00 AM
tomorrow work for you?

12:11.759 --> 12:14.993
And you worked closely
with Caroline, Mr. Ward?

12:14.995 --> 12:16.762
Senior Vice President
of Operations.

12:16.764 --> 12:17.996
<i>I was her right hand.</i>

12:17.998 --> 12:20.733
Her death was a huge loss.

12:20.735 --> 12:23.001
Caroline was Infinince.

12:23.003 --> 12:25.605
Will the company
fail without her?

12:25.607 --> 12:27.172
Oh, no, we're in good hands now

12:27.174 --> 12:29.374
with Dean Reston, our new CEO.

12:29.376 --> 12:32.177
And the 5K standard
that Caroline developed

12:32.179 --> 12:34.847
is about to put us back on top.

12:34.849 --> 12:39.084
It's just a shame she won't
be alive to see it happen.

12:39.086 --> 12:42.454
Did Caroline's success
make her husband jealous?

12:42.456 --> 12:43.889
She did mention once

12:43.891 --> 12:45.423
that they'd been
fighting a lot.

12:45.425 --> 12:47.459
<i>She was thinking</i>
<i>about a divorce.</i>

12:47.461 --> 12:49.227
<i>And when was this?</i>

12:49.229 --> 12:50.662
Two weeks before she died.

12:53.299 --> 12:54.466
<i>Thank you, Mr. Ward.</i>

12:54.468 --> 12:55.800
Would you say Caroline

12:55.802 --> 12:58.035
was an easy person to work for?

12:58.037 --> 13:00.538
Sure. Absolutely.

13:00.540 --> 13:02.206
Exhibit A7, Your Honor.

13:02.208 --> 13:06.443
A personnel report
signed by Phillip Ward.

13:06.445 --> 13:09.247
Could you read to me
from page six, please?

13:10.816 --> 13:13.818
"Attrition due to
stress-related illnesses,

13:13.820 --> 13:16.754
including migraines, ulcers,
and mental health problems

13:16.756 --> 13:19.055
<i>have increased by 15%."</i>

13:19.057 --> 13:21.392
"Stress-related
illnesses."

13:21.394 --> 13:23.727
Caroline's employees
were so miserable,

13:23.729 --> 13:26.730
they were getting sick,
leaving the company in droves.

13:26.732 --> 13:28.832
Isn't it possible
one of them killed her?

13:28.834 --> 13:30.000
Objection.

13:30.002 --> 13:31.168
<i>Sustained.</i>

13:31.170 --> 13:32.636
<i>Nothing further.</i>

13:32.638 --> 13:34.638
<i>We will now recess for lunch.</i>

13:34.640 --> 13:36.439
No. Karen!

13:36.441 --> 13:38.574
Karen, you do not have
that meeting without me.

13:38.576 --> 13:40.376
<i>I said we push so we push.</i>

13:40.378 --> 13:42.078
<i>If Emma's there
to kill anybody,</i>

13:42.080 --> 13:44.514
she must be planning
on using her bare hands.

13:44.516 --> 13:46.183
I couldn't find any evidence

13:46.185 --> 13:47.951
that she was trying
to buy a weapon.

13:47.953 --> 13:50.086
Perhaps her plan involves
a method of attack

13:50.088 --> 13:51.487
you haven't considered.

13:51.489 --> 13:54.089
I know a lot of ways
to kill people, Harold.

13:56.026 --> 13:57.593
<i>She just pulled
out a second phone.</i>

14:05.969 --> 14:06.969
_

14:06.970 --> 14:08.871
Are you seeing this,
Mr. Reese?

14:10.307 --> 14:12.308
Maybe I couldn't
find out Emma's plan

14:12.310 --> 14:14.143
because she's working
with a partner.

14:14.145 --> 14:15.059
Here's lunch.

14:15.114 --> 14:17.779
<i>Oh, good. Give me a bite.
I'm hungry.</i>

14:17.781 --> 14:19.982
Oh, thank you.

14:22.104 --> 14:23.793
_

14:23.860 --> 14:25.792
_

14:28.524 --> 14:31.360
Or maybe she's not
a partner after all,

14:31.362 --> 14:33.628
but an unwilling participant.

14:33.630 --> 14:35.764
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

14:37.384 --> 14:39.082
_

14:39.247 --> 14:41.104
_

14:42.292 --> 14:44.641
_

14:44.642 --> 14:46.887
_

14:51.714 --> 14:52.747
Fiona?

14:54.784 --> 14:57.051
Fiona, what's wrong?

14:57.053 --> 14:58.352
It's an allergic reaction.

14:58.354 --> 14:59.653
She's in anaphylactic shock.

15:01.189 --> 15:02.222
Must have one of those

15:02.224 --> 15:04.024
epi-pen things
on her, right?

15:04.026 --> 15:06.159
She told the bailiff
she couldn't have eggs.

15:06.161 --> 15:08.028
<i>There's eggs in mayo, right?</i>

15:08.030 --> 15:09.497
Call 911.

15:09.499 --> 15:12.165
We need an ambulance.

15:12.167 --> 15:14.201
Emma's not the perpetrator
here, Mr. Reese.

15:14.203 --> 15:16.336
Someone's trying
to fix this trial,

15:16.338 --> 15:18.205
and they're willing to kill
to make it happen.

15:30.348 --> 15:32.115
<i>Our poisoned
juror should recover,</i>

15:32.117 --> 15:33.917
<i>but she won't be back in court</i>
<i>anytime soon.</i>

15:33.919 --> 15:35.719
An alternate will
take her place.

15:35.721 --> 15:37.554
Whoever's using Emma
to fix the trial

15:37.556 --> 15:38.688
isn't playing around.

15:38.690 --> 15:40.590
Any idea who
sent her those texts?

15:40.592 --> 15:42.758
Not yet, but in the meantime,

15:42.760 --> 15:44.693
I think I know
who's behind this.

15:44.695 --> 15:47.130
<i>It looks like Chad Bryson</i>
<i>hired some sort of a fixer</i>

15:47.132 --> 15:49.232
to make sure he's found
not guilty.

15:49.234 --> 15:50.599
And since we got Emma's number,

15:50.601 --> 15:52.435
they're probably
planning to kill her

15:52.437 --> 15:54.637
<i>and any other jurors</i>
<i>who get in their way.</i>

15:54.639 --> 15:57.307
They're trying to tip
the scales of justice.

15:57.309 --> 15:58.507
We're gonna tip them back.

16:02.546 --> 16:04.212
Hello, John.

16:04.214 --> 16:05.714
Been a while.

16:05.716 --> 16:07.817
Zoe.

16:07.819 --> 16:09.452
What are you doing here?

16:09.454 --> 16:10.886
I do a lot of business here.

16:10.888 --> 16:12.555
Especially when
high-ranking officials

16:12.557 --> 16:15.324
get arrested in a hot tub
with hookers and blow

16:15.326 --> 16:17.392
and they need me
to clean up the mess.

16:17.394 --> 16:19.828
So...

16:19.830 --> 16:21.763
Detective.

16:21.765 --> 16:23.298
What are you doing here?

16:23.300 --> 16:26.068
Undercover work.

16:26.070 --> 16:27.402
It's a long story.

16:27.404 --> 16:28.736
Did you really think

16:28.738 --> 16:30.105
you could fix the
Chad Bryson trial

16:30.107 --> 16:32.507
without calling me for help?

16:34.276 --> 16:37.111
I saw you snapping
picture of the jurors,

16:37.113 --> 16:38.746
and Harold's one of them.

16:38.748 --> 16:42.650
Thanks, but we can handle this.

16:42.652 --> 16:43.685
Yeah.

16:43.687 --> 16:45.186
So one question.

16:45.188 --> 16:47.922
If business lady
votes "not guilty,"

16:47.924 --> 16:49.890
what's Grandpa gonna vote?

16:49.892 --> 16:51.359
<i>He's a cranky old man.</i>

16:51.361 --> 16:52.926
<i>She seems like a pain</i>
<i>in the ass.</i>

16:52.928 --> 16:55.463
She votes one way,

16:55.465 --> 16:56.998
he votes the opposite.

16:57.000 --> 16:57.999
<i>Guilty.</i>

16:58.001 --> 16:59.700
Good guess.

16:59.702 --> 17:02.203
Totally wrong.

17:02.205 --> 17:03.637
<i>Do you see what he's doing?</i>

17:03.639 --> 17:06.172
He's taking a drink
after she does.

17:06.174 --> 17:07.840
<i>That's called mirroring.</i>

17:07.843 --> 17:09.843
It means that, whether
he knows it or not,

17:09.845 --> 17:12.980
he has accepted her
as the alpha.

17:12.982 --> 17:15.448
If she votes "not guilty,"

17:15.450 --> 17:17.117
he will, too.

17:19.185 --> 17:21.121
You got some place
we can go work?

17:26.527 --> 17:28.461
All anyone at our company wants

17:28.463 --> 17:30.696
is what Caroline deserves,
justice.

17:30.698 --> 17:32.732
Thank you very much.
Excuse me.

17:32.734 --> 17:34.501
Here's what I've got so far.

17:34.503 --> 17:36.503
Alpha-bitch Lana,
well, she'd be fired

17:36.505 --> 17:37.970
in a heartbeat
if her bosses knew

17:37.972 --> 17:39.505
that she was embezzling.

17:39.507 --> 17:43.009
Superfan Tim has a good
size gambling problem,

17:43.011 --> 17:45.144
and good old Mel
has a 40-year-old

17:45.146 --> 17:47.813
illegitimate son that he
hasn't told his wife about.

17:47.815 --> 17:50.082
We were trying to
swing a verdict, Zoe,

17:50.084 --> 17:51.884
not ruin their lives.

17:51.886 --> 17:53.653
Well, a little
leverage never hurts.

17:54.855 --> 17:57.222
Court is adjourned,
Mr. Reese.

17:57.224 --> 17:59.258
What have you been--

17:59.260 --> 18:00.392
Ms. Morgan.

18:00.394 --> 18:01.893
Harold.

18:01.895 --> 18:03.262
It's lovely to see you.

18:03.264 --> 18:05.997
And so unexpected.

18:05.999 --> 18:08.200
John? A word?

18:11.203 --> 18:12.537
I thought we agreed
not to involve

18:12.539 --> 18:14.372
any more innocent
people in our work.

18:14.374 --> 18:17.075
Well, Zoe's not exactly
what I'd call innocent.

18:17.077 --> 18:20.244
Besides, she insisted.

18:20.246 --> 18:21.546
And saying no
to Ms. Morgan

18:21.548 --> 18:23.682
was never your
strong suit, was it?

18:23.684 --> 18:25.817
Boys, are we gonna
work or what?

18:26.619 --> 18:29.053
Mm-mm.

18:29.055 --> 18:32.290
So unless there's some
prosecutorial misconduct

18:32.292 --> 18:34.258
going on, nine
times out of ten,

18:34.260 --> 18:36.260
the person who wants
to fix this trial

18:36.262 --> 18:38.129
is the person on trial.

18:38.131 --> 18:39.397
Chad Bryson.

18:39.399 --> 18:40.731
I hacked into Chad's accounts

18:40.733 --> 18:42.032
to see if there
were any payments

18:42.034 --> 18:43.701
that would help
identify this fixer.

18:43.703 --> 18:45.135
Nothing unusual
that I could find.

18:45.137 --> 18:46.870
So whoever the fixer is,

18:46.872 --> 18:47.905
they're good.

18:47.907 --> 18:49.106
Well, they certainly picked

18:49.108 --> 18:51.075
the right person
to sway the jury.

18:51.077 --> 18:53.243
Emma's smart, she's patient,

18:53.245 --> 18:54.812
she's likeable.

18:54.814 --> 18:57.081
If Emma says that
Chad's not guilty,

18:57.083 --> 18:59.449
people are gonna believe her.

18:59.451 --> 19:01.651
When you walk in
that jury room,

19:01.653 --> 19:04.221
<i>all Emma needs is</i>
<i>reasonable doubt.</i>

19:04.223 --> 19:06.656
<i>You carry the burden of proof.</i>

19:06.658 --> 19:09.493
And we need to get you ready.

19:09.495 --> 19:11.595
Okay.
You've seen the evidence.

19:11.597 --> 19:13.163
You've heard
the closing arguments.

19:13.165 --> 19:14.764
You're all in the jury room,

19:14.766 --> 19:18.467
and Emma says she doesn't
think Chad did it.

19:18.469 --> 19:19.736
What do you say?

19:19.738 --> 19:21.838
Oh! Well...

19:21.840 --> 19:23.339
Based on all the
evidence we've seen,

19:23.341 --> 19:24.674
I think it's hard to imagine

19:24.676 --> 19:25.675
that he's not guilty.

19:25.677 --> 19:26.843
What about the trainer

19:26.845 --> 19:27.977
who saw him leaving the gym

19:27.979 --> 19:29.345
at the time of the murder?

19:29.347 --> 19:31.014
That's reasonable doubt
right there.

19:31.016 --> 19:32.448
I suppose, technically.

19:32.450 --> 19:35.317
Every situation has some
measure of uncertainty.

19:35.319 --> 19:37.753
Harold, this isn't science.
It's law.

19:37.755 --> 19:40.189
Rational thought doesn't apply.

19:40.191 --> 19:42.090
The cell records
clearly place Chad

19:42.092 --> 19:43.359
near the house
when it happened.

19:43.361 --> 19:45.327
So?
I hear that can be faked.

19:45.329 --> 19:47.296
I got a friend who can do it.

19:47.298 --> 19:49.632
Now, that's just cheating.

19:49.634 --> 19:51.366
I mean, look what he says
in these e-mails.

19:51.368 --> 19:53.969
Chad can't stand
Caroline's success.

19:53.971 --> 19:55.436
That's one solid motive.

19:55.438 --> 19:57.839
Lots of people resent
a successful woman.

19:57.841 --> 19:58.974
Doesn't mean he killed her.

19:58.976 --> 20:00.676
Fine, but lots of people

20:00.678 --> 20:02.678
don't have this much evidence
saying they did it.

20:02.680 --> 20:05.013
Better, but it's
still too polite.

20:05.015 --> 20:07.582
What, are you from the
Midwest or something?

20:09.218 --> 20:10.851
Yeah, I just don't
think he did it.

20:10.853 --> 20:12.287
Are you kidding me?

20:12.289 --> 20:13.788
Look at all of this.

20:13.790 --> 20:16.291
The divorce papers,
the angry voicemails,

20:16.293 --> 20:17.292
the bloody footprint.

20:17.294 --> 20:18.859
Look at all that and tell me

20:18.861 --> 20:21.329
that Chad Bryson
is not guilty as sin.

20:26.735 --> 20:29.904
At this point, my
biggest challenge tomorrow

20:29.906 --> 20:32.740
will be staying awake.

20:37.012 --> 20:38.813
You got plans?

20:38.815 --> 20:40.380
The night's still young.

20:40.382 --> 20:42.482
Thought I might hit
up some contacts,

20:42.484 --> 20:44.150
see if I can find
out who Chad hired

20:44.152 --> 20:45.319
to fix this trial.

20:47.888 --> 20:50.123
Unless you have
something else in mind.

20:52.594 --> 20:54.661
I still got other work to do.

20:56.764 --> 20:59.699
Well, I'll be damned.

20:59.701 --> 21:01.500
You're interested in
someone, aren't you?

21:04.205 --> 21:06.405
You don't know me as well
as you think you do.

21:06.407 --> 21:09.909
I think I know you better
than you know yourself.

21:09.911 --> 21:13.879
And whoever she is,
it won't last.

21:16.182 --> 21:18.684
People like you and me,
we're great for a night

21:18.686 --> 21:20.786
or great for a weekend...

21:22.357 --> 21:25.358
But we really suck
at letting people in.

21:25.360 --> 21:26.959
We're just not built that way.

21:29.528 --> 21:31.797
Sleep tight, John.

21:53.419 --> 21:55.387
You know, John, when you
said you wanted to talk,

21:55.389 --> 21:58.089
I thought there would
be more actual talking.

22:00.827 --> 22:03.327
So your whole family's police?

22:03.329 --> 22:05.562
Going back five generations.

22:05.564 --> 22:07.431
You ever think about
doing the job?

22:07.433 --> 22:09.300
I went through the
academy, actually.

22:09.302 --> 22:10.802
<i>Graduated and everything.</i>

22:10.804 --> 22:13.337
But I guess I was
more interested

22:13.339 --> 22:16.073
in what was going on
inside other cops' heads.

22:16.075 --> 22:17.942
Your dad disappointed?

22:17.944 --> 22:21.679
I think he was mostly
just glad I was safe.

22:21.681 --> 22:23.447
When I was a kid,

22:23.449 --> 22:25.449
he taught me so
much self-defense

22:25.451 --> 22:27.184
that when my high
school prom date

22:27.186 --> 22:28.652
got a little handsy,

22:28.654 --> 22:30.354
I wound up knocking him out

22:30.356 --> 22:31.855
and making a citizen's arrest.

22:33.326 --> 22:36.126
Poor kid's parents
threatened to sue.

22:36.128 --> 22:37.994
I actually did get
sued when I was a kid.

22:37.996 --> 22:38.929
<i>No.</i>

22:38.931 --> 22:40.297
I did.

22:40.299 --> 22:41.998
My dad was trying
to teach me how to drive.

22:42.000 --> 22:46.469
So I put our
family's Oldsmobile

22:46.471 --> 22:48.138
through the side of
our neighbor's house.

22:49.208 --> 22:50.207
I'm guessing you didn't

22:50.209 --> 22:51.774
get your license for a while.

22:51.776 --> 22:54.876
I was only eight
years old at the time.

22:57.213 --> 22:58.814
Are you and your dad
still in touch?

23:03.720 --> 23:06.120
We lost him when
I was pretty young,

23:06.122 --> 23:07.622
but I...

23:10.125 --> 23:12.060
I never talk about him.

23:14.129 --> 23:17.966
Have you lost a lot
of people, John?

23:17.968 --> 23:20.601
<i>But you don't talk about</i>
<i>any of them, do you?</i>

23:24.206 --> 23:25.773
Why do you think that is?

23:27.142 --> 23:30.711
It's a occupational hazard.

23:30.713 --> 23:36.350
With the work I've done,
privacy becomes...

23:36.352 --> 23:37.818
a habit.

23:37.820 --> 23:40.488
Maybe it's time for
some new habits.

23:40.490 --> 23:43.724
Sometimes, habits are
there to protect you.

23:43.726 --> 23:45.225
From what?

23:45.227 --> 23:47.895
From life.

23:47.897 --> 23:49.429
From the way things go.

23:51.565 --> 23:53.000
From the fact that every time

23:53.002 --> 23:55.168
you get close
to someone, you...

24:04.678 --> 24:07.614
<i>And you have seen
clear evidence that only</i>

24:07.616 --> 24:12.452
Chad Bryson had the means,
motive, and opportunity

24:12.454 --> 24:15.555
to enter the home
he and Caroline shared

24:15.557 --> 24:17.223
<i>and to shoot her not once,</i>

24:17.225 --> 24:23.429
not twice, but three times
in her chest.

24:23.431 --> 24:26.098
<i>Now Caroline needs you</i>
<i>to speak out,</i>

24:26.100 --> 24:28.301
<i>because her voice was silenced.</i>

24:28.303 --> 24:29.936
<i>How's Emma doing?</i>

24:29.938 --> 24:31.103
She looks a bit worried,

24:31.105 --> 24:32.305
but given the circumstances,

24:32.307 --> 24:33.705
who wouldn't?

24:33.707 --> 24:35.140
<i>Any luck locating the fixer</i>

24:35.142 --> 24:36.875
<i>so we can put a stop</i>
<i>to all this?</i>

24:36.877 --> 24:39.611
No, you'll just have to
piss him off enough

24:39.613 --> 24:41.112
to bring him out in the open.

24:41.114 --> 24:43.649
We are in recess
for deliberations.

24:43.651 --> 24:45.317
<i>Showtime, Harold.</i>

24:46.953 --> 24:48.119
Well, in the interest

24:48.121 --> 24:49.387
of getting us home quickly,

24:49.389 --> 24:50.521
I can serve as foreperson.

24:50.523 --> 24:52.490
No, actually, I'd like the job.

24:55.395 --> 24:57.662
With all due respect, ma'am,

24:57.664 --> 24:59.831
I handle rooms like
this one every day.

24:59.833 --> 25:01.899
And I was a teacher
for many years.

25:01.901 --> 25:04.702
I know quite a lot
about resolving disputes.

25:06.305 --> 25:08.005
Should we put it to a vote?

25:08.007 --> 25:09.507
Fine.

25:09.509 --> 25:11.075
Everyone for me?

25:18.651 --> 25:19.851
All yours.

25:21.419 --> 25:23.420
<i>Okay. Emma made her first move.</i>

25:23.422 --> 25:24.921
You need to come out swinging.

25:24.923 --> 25:26.290
Give 'em hell, Harry.

25:26.292 --> 25:28.025
Please don't call me that.

25:28.027 --> 25:29.126
<i>Okay.</i>

25:29.128 --> 25:30.527
Should we get started?

25:30.529 --> 25:33.630
Well, this Chad person
is clearly guilty.

25:33.632 --> 25:34.931
The voicemail he left Caroline

25:34.933 --> 25:36.300
shows he had motive,

25:36.302 --> 25:38.935
and the cell phone
places him at the house.

25:38.937 --> 25:40.504
<i>Why would there</i>
<i>be a print of his shoe</i>

25:40.506 --> 25:43.607
in her blood if he wasn't
the one who killed her?

25:43.609 --> 25:45.909
Yes. Exactly.

25:45.911 --> 25:48.979
<i>What Harold said.</i>
<i>This man is guilty.</i>

25:48.981 --> 25:50.179
Wait; wasn't
Emma supposed

25:50.181 --> 25:54.017
to be pushing for "not guilty"?

25:54.019 --> 25:55.118
There's only one person

25:55.120 --> 25:56.219
that would want to make sure

25:56.221 --> 25:58.221
that Chad Bryson
is found guilty

25:58.223 --> 26:00.189
of murdering Caroline Mills,

26:00.191 --> 26:03.059
and that's the person
who actually killed her.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.527
Finch...

26:04.529 --> 26:06.162
<i>we've got a big problem here.</i>

26:20.544 --> 26:22.112
<i>Okay.</i>

26:22.114 --> 26:25.148
I think Harold has made
some very good points here.

26:25.150 --> 26:28.084
I mean, is there
anyone in this room

26:28.086 --> 26:30.854
who isn't positive
that Chad is guilty?

26:30.856 --> 26:32.288
<i>We read this one all wrong.</i>

26:32.290 --> 26:34.224
There's no way Chad's
paying a fixer

26:34.226 --> 26:35.859
<i>to have himself found guilty.</i>

26:35.861 --> 26:38.193
So someone else is trying
to fix this trial.

26:38.195 --> 26:40.296
That someone probably
killed Caroline.

26:40.298 --> 26:41.497
We need to find that fixer

26:41.499 --> 26:42.931
and hunt down the real killer.

26:42.933 --> 26:44.500
What am I supposed to do?

26:44.502 --> 26:46.068
Stall.

26:46.070 --> 26:47.035
<i>Okay.</i>

26:47.037 --> 26:48.203
<i>Let's put it to a vote.</i>

26:48.205 --> 26:50.139
Who thinks the defendant
is guilty?

26:58.014 --> 26:59.614
The hell, Professor?

26:59.616 --> 27:01.016
Weren't you all
"give him the chair"

27:01.018 --> 27:02.117
a second ago?

27:02.119 --> 27:03.351
I may have been a bit hasty

27:03.353 --> 27:05.287
when we first walked
in the room,

27:05.289 --> 27:07.289
<i>but I got to thinking</i>
<i>about what's at stake here.</i>

27:07.291 --> 27:08.723
Chad Bryson's freedom.

27:08.725 --> 27:10.992
Justice for Caroline's death.

27:10.994 --> 27:15.129
And I think maybe
we owe it to Caroline

27:15.131 --> 27:17.131
to take just a little more time

27:17.133 --> 27:20.302
and really think this through.

27:20.304 --> 27:22.236
How much time, exactly?

27:22.238 --> 27:25.640
Well, as long
as it takes, I suppose.

27:25.642 --> 27:28.575
Now, let's just go
through the evidence again

27:28.577 --> 27:30.011
piece by piece.

27:35.117 --> 27:36.984
<i>I'm sorry, but
I'm still not convinced,</i>

27:36.986 --> 27:38.752
and I don't think
I'm the only one.

27:38.754 --> 27:39.753
Harold.

27:39.755 --> 27:41.488
Ms. Vara and Mr. Paladino

27:41.490 --> 27:43.056
have come around
to my point of view.

27:43.058 --> 27:44.891
All I said was I
wasn't sure anymore.

27:44.893 --> 27:46.159
That's reasonable doubt.

27:46.161 --> 27:47.394
Please, Harold.

27:47.396 --> 27:49.062
Now, if we can
take one more look

27:49.064 --> 27:51.097
at that partial fingerprint
found near the crime scene--

27:51.099 --> 27:52.733
No. No.
There's nothing more to look at.

27:52.735 --> 27:54.167
There's nothing more
to talk about.

27:54.169 --> 27:55.769
You have to change your mind.

27:55.771 --> 27:57.438
Come on, man.
This is ridiculous.

27:58.674 --> 27:59.940
<i>Okay, okay, okay.</i>

27:59.942 --> 28:01.241
This isn't getting us anywhere,

28:01.243 --> 28:02.242
so let's just...

28:03.611 --> 28:05.545
...take a break.

28:07.282 --> 28:09.950
Please tell me
that you're making progress.

28:09.952 --> 28:11.251
You tell us.

28:11.253 --> 28:12.719
I'm sending you
a technical report

28:12.721 --> 28:14.620
on Caroline's 5K system.

28:14.622 --> 28:17.223
Need you to translate it
into normal English.

28:19.560 --> 28:21.160
Where did you get this?

28:21.162 --> 28:22.762
<i>Looking over the evidence,</i>

28:22.764 --> 28:25.197
we started to think
that there might be a cover-up

28:25.199 --> 28:26.632
going on at Infinince.

28:26.634 --> 28:28.801
So I used some
of your hacking tools

28:28.803 --> 28:30.436
to break into their servers.

28:30.438 --> 28:32.437
<i>We found this in</i>
<i>one of Caroline's</i>

28:32.439 --> 28:33.939
<i>deleted e-mail threads.</i>

28:33.941 --> 28:35.941
Well, I can see
why she deleted it.

28:35.943 --> 28:37.642
<i>It's a consumer</i>
<i>safety evaluation</i>

28:37.644 --> 28:39.111
<i>for their 5K system.</i>

28:39.113 --> 28:40.412
The cell towers were operating

28:40.414 --> 28:42.381
at more than 200 watts,

28:42.383 --> 28:44.950
producing ground-level
absorption figures

28:44.952 --> 28:47.119
far in excess of the SAR limit

28:47.121 --> 28:48.887
of 1.6 watts
per kilogram.

28:48.889 --> 28:51.122
Did you not hear the part
about English, Harold?

28:51.124 --> 28:55.794
The 5K cell towers
could microwave people.

28:55.796 --> 28:58.062
<i>Exposure like that could</i>
<i>cause any number</i>

28:58.064 --> 29:00.064
of health problems-- nausea,
migraine headaches,

29:00.066 --> 29:01.132
even cancer.

29:01.134 --> 29:02.267
Didn't Chad's attorney

29:02.269 --> 29:03.268
say people at the company

29:03.270 --> 29:04.335
were getting sick?

29:04.337 --> 29:05.937
And I think I know why.

29:05.939 --> 29:07.638
The prototype 5K tower

29:07.640 --> 29:09.473
was built at their
corporate headquarters.

29:09.475 --> 29:10.942
You think one of the employees

29:10.944 --> 29:12.843
may have killed Caroline
for making them sick?

29:12.845 --> 29:15.479
Caroline wasn't
making them sick.

29:15.481 --> 29:17.515
She was trying to stop
it from happening.

29:17.517 --> 29:18.983
<i>After seeing this report,</i>

29:18.985 --> 29:20.518
<i>she said she wouldn't</i>
<i>sell anything</i>

29:20.520 --> 29:22.420
that was gonna hurt people.

29:22.422 --> 29:23.987
<i>She tried to
call off the 5K deal.</i>

29:23.989 --> 29:26.323
She would've cost
the company billions.

29:26.325 --> 29:29.159
So someone at Infinince
killed her to shut her up,

29:29.161 --> 29:30.994
and they framed Chad
for her murder.

29:34.099 --> 29:35.732
<i>Well, this
might be our someone.</i>

29:35.734 --> 29:37.534
<i>Dean Reston...</i>

29:37.536 --> 29:40.770
was tapped as CEO just a few
days after Caroline's death.

29:41.974 --> 29:43.506
John.

29:43.508 --> 29:45.041
<i>Damning cell phone video</i>

29:45.043 --> 29:46.676
<i>shows Chad Bryson</i>
<i>in a heated dispute</i>

29:46.678 --> 29:48.277
<i>with his wife, Caroline Mills,</i>

29:48.279 --> 29:50.379
<i>just two days</i>
<i>before she was killed.</i>

29:50.381 --> 29:53.516
Well, I think our fixer
is fighting back.

29:53.518 --> 29:55.852
He suspects a mole on the jury,

29:55.854 --> 29:58.855
<i>he leaks this, and it cuts off</i>
<i>our contact with Harold.</i>

29:58.857 --> 30:01.824
Uh, the judge is having
us sequestered

30:01.826 --> 30:04.060
until we reach a verdict.

30:04.062 --> 30:05.461
So forever.

30:05.463 --> 30:07.796
We're stuck here forever.

30:11.201 --> 30:12.734
<i>No electronics. Judge's orders.</i>

30:12.736 --> 30:13.902
You'll get all your toys back

30:13.904 --> 30:15.304
when this is over.

30:15.306 --> 30:16.772
<i>Don't worry, Finch.</i>

30:16.774 --> 30:18.206
<i>We'll keep an eye</i>
<i>on you and Emma</i>

30:18.208 --> 30:19.475
<i>and find a way</i>
<i>to get to the bott--</i>

30:24.814 --> 30:25.981
No visitors, okay?

30:34.523 --> 30:36.057
What in the world?

30:37.894 --> 30:39.027
<i>Harold.</i>

30:39.028 --> 30:41.174
_

30:43.032 --> 30:44.299
Now...

30:48.437 --> 30:51.338
Where is your
internet connection?

30:53.608 --> 30:54.809
Ah!

31:01.683 --> 31:03.117
Morse code.

31:03.119 --> 31:05.052
<i>Relax...</i>

31:05.054 --> 31:06.520
Finch...

31:06.522 --> 31:09.155
it's... me.

31:18.299 --> 31:22.369
Please... stop...

31:22.371 --> 31:26.339
pointing... that... thing...

31:27.742 --> 31:29.242
at me.

31:29.244 --> 31:30.409
Don't worry.

31:31.746 --> 31:33.346
Pretty sure...

31:34.749 --> 31:35.982
it's not loaded.

32:12.818 --> 32:15.287
Finch, get out on your...

32:15.289 --> 32:16.454
Balcony.

32:17.523 --> 32:18.856
Now.

32:40.523 --> 32:41.623
<i>Don't.</i>

32:43.192 --> 32:45.193
Please.
You don't have to do this.

32:45.195 --> 32:47.295
Yes, I do, or someone
else will get hurt.

32:48.597 --> 32:50.198
Someone whose life
still matters.

32:50.200 --> 32:51.466
No, your life matters.

32:51.468 --> 32:53.301
No. No, it doesn't.

32:54.570 --> 32:55.804
Not for a while now.

33:05.547 --> 33:08.716
I know someone's using you
to fix the trial,

33:08.718 --> 33:10.584
and I know that you've only
gone along with it

33:10.586 --> 33:13.321
to protect others.

33:13.323 --> 33:16.824
But we can't put
an innocent man in prison.

33:16.826 --> 33:19.593
Chad Bryson
didn't kill Caroline.

33:19.595 --> 33:22.429
Someone at her company did
because she was about to

33:22.431 --> 33:25.098
put people
ahead of a billion dollar deal.

33:25.100 --> 33:26.834
Uh...

33:26.836 --> 33:30.337
Caroline had the courage
to stand up for what's right.

33:32.439 --> 33:34.341
We'll help you do the same.

33:51.258 --> 33:53.058
Hey, Zoe.

33:53.060 --> 33:54.827
You'd be proud of Harold.

33:54.829 --> 33:56.962
<i>He just got Emma</i>
<i>to change her mind.</i>

33:56.964 --> 33:58.865
Any luck proving
Reston killed Caroline?

33:58.867 --> 34:00.633
<i>Not yet.</i>

34:00.635 --> 34:02.201
<i>But I have a lead</i>
<i>on the fixer's location.</i>

34:02.203 --> 34:04.704
Three days before the trial,
someone at Infinince

34:04.706 --> 34:06.638
used money from a corporate
slush fund

34:06.640 --> 34:09.541
<i>to rent an empty floor</i>
<i>across from the courthouse.</i>

34:09.543 --> 34:11.443
You got all that
from their computer?

34:11.445 --> 34:12.878
Hell no.

34:12.880 --> 34:14.880
But a magician never
reveals her secrets.

34:14.882 --> 34:16.982
Now, you want the fixer's
location or not?

34:19.252 --> 34:20.819
My friend is on his way
to stop the person

34:20.821 --> 34:22.219
that's been threatening you.

34:22.222 --> 34:24.022
This will all be over soon.

34:27.726 --> 34:29.661
Do you know who's behind this?

34:29.663 --> 34:32.597
No, I...
I got the jury summons,

34:32.599 --> 34:34.833
and the first time in my life,

34:34.835 --> 34:36.134
it wasn't a problem.

34:36.136 --> 34:38.768
It sounded like fun.

34:38.771 --> 34:40.071
How pathetic is that?

34:40.072 --> 34:42.572
The night before I was
supposed to report,

34:42.574 --> 34:44.141
there was a knock at my door.

34:44.143 --> 34:45.176
I opened it.

34:45.178 --> 34:46.476
No one was there.

34:46.478 --> 34:48.079
There was a brown envelope.

34:48.081 --> 34:50.181
Full of newspaper
clippings about the trial.

34:50.183 --> 34:51.449
Yes.

34:51.451 --> 34:53.751
And a cheap cell phone.

34:53.753 --> 34:55.418
There was a text.

34:55.420 --> 34:57.688
It said I had to
get on that jury,

34:57.690 --> 35:00.758
and if I didn't follow orders,

35:00.760 --> 35:02.025
people would die.

35:02.027 --> 35:03.427
Why didn't you call the police?

35:03.429 --> 35:05.095
I started to call 911,

35:05.097 --> 35:06.597
but there was a gunshot.

35:06.599 --> 35:08.365
Paula, my neighbor,
said that someone

35:08.367 --> 35:09.867
shot a bullet
through their window.

35:09.869 --> 35:12.635
It barely missed
her little girl.

35:12.637 --> 35:14.271
I got another text.

35:14.273 --> 35:17.040
"The next one
won't miss."

35:17.042 --> 35:19.176
So from that moment on,

35:19.178 --> 35:21.211
I just did what I was told.

35:24.215 --> 35:25.515
Anyone in your position

35:25.517 --> 35:27.351
would have done
exactly the same thing.

35:27.353 --> 35:29.018
He-- he didn't pick you.

35:29.020 --> 35:31.120
He didn't pick Lana or Mel.

35:31.122 --> 35:32.288
Of all the people that were

35:32.290 --> 35:33.857
in that jury room that day,

35:33.859 --> 35:35.124
he picked me.

35:35.126 --> 35:36.359
Why?

35:36.361 --> 35:38.695
Did he know something about me?

35:38.697 --> 35:41.998
Was it because
I let them take my job?

35:42.000 --> 35:43.566
I loved teaching so much,

35:43.568 --> 35:46.369
and I let them take it
away from me.

35:46.371 --> 35:49.872
I'm-- I'm just a pushover.

35:49.874 --> 35:52.340
For them.

35:52.342 --> 35:53.375
And for him.

35:53.377 --> 35:55.878
What else could you have done?

35:55.880 --> 35:57.846
He said he was
going to hurt people,

35:57.848 --> 36:00.181
and he wasn't lying about that.

36:00.183 --> 36:02.985
But can you imagine
how that would feel?

36:02.987 --> 36:06.488
To know that something
bad was gonna happen

36:06.490 --> 36:09.690
<i>and it was your fault if</i>
<i>it doesn't get stopped?</i>

36:22.104 --> 36:24.805
<i>I mean, I have no idea
what's taking this jury so long.</i>

36:24.807 --> 36:27.174
<i>This case is open and shut.</i>

36:27.176 --> 36:29.510
<i>I'm supposed to-- I know I'm</i>
<i>supposed to say "allegedly"</i>

36:29.512 --> 36:32.279
<i>when I talk about this stuff,</i>
<i>so here you go.</i>

36:32.281 --> 36:34.314
<i>I'm no expert on legal matters,</i>

36:34.316 --> 36:35.683
<i>but I think it's pretty clear</i>
<i>something ridiculous is...</i>

36:35.685 --> 36:37.552
<i>Any luck, John?</i>

36:37.554 --> 36:39.553
We can't nail Reston
without catching his fixer.

36:39.555 --> 36:40.720
Nobody's home.

36:40.722 --> 36:41.721
<i>But I think the fixer</i>

36:41.723 --> 36:44.525
<i>knows I'm here.</i>

36:44.527 --> 36:46.560
<i>And I think I know</i>
<i>why he's not.</i>

36:46.562 --> 36:49.296
He only has information
on 11 jurors.

36:49.298 --> 36:50.864
Zoe, that fixer we've been
looking for,

36:50.866 --> 36:52.332
he's on the jury.

36:52.334 --> 36:53.767
<i>He had Emma do the dirty work,</i>

36:53.769 --> 36:55.436
<i>and he was watching her</i>
<i>the whole time.</i>

36:55.438 --> 36:58.404
And he's in the hotel
with her and Finch right now.

36:58.406 --> 37:01.775
What was that?

37:06.714 --> 37:08.147
Tim!
Stay away from us.

37:08.149 --> 37:09.883
Oh, I tried to
keep my distance.

37:09.885 --> 37:11.217
That's the whole point of using

37:11.219 --> 37:13.453
honest Emma the schoolmarm
to persuade people

37:13.455 --> 37:14.920
instead of doing it myself.

37:14.922 --> 37:16.655
But just like the rest
of your life, Emma,

37:16.657 --> 37:18.057
you've screwed this up royally,

37:18.059 --> 37:19.892
and now Harold
has to pay the price.

37:19.894 --> 37:20.926
- Oh, no!
- Emma!

37:22.763 --> 37:24.797
See, poor Harold couldn't stand

37:24.799 --> 37:27.233
being the odd man out.

37:27.235 --> 37:28.667
So tragically,

37:28.669 --> 37:30.603
he's about to take
his own life.

37:30.605 --> 37:31.770
I warned you what would happen

37:31.772 --> 37:33.973
if you disobeyed, Emma.

37:33.975 --> 37:37.910
So this one's on you.

37:37.912 --> 37:39.311
Uh!

37:56.496 --> 37:58.196
Uh! Ah! Uh!

38:09.843 --> 38:11.843
Uh!

38:18.150 --> 38:20.484
Why the hell would you save me?

38:20.486 --> 38:22.919
Because I want
to see you stand trial.

38:30.328 --> 38:32.029
<i>Your Honor, in
light of new evidence,</i>

38:32.031 --> 38:33.697
the people are
dropping all charges

38:33.699 --> 38:35.265
against Chad Bryson.

38:35.267 --> 38:37.067
<i>Mr. Bryson, you're free to go,</i>

38:37.069 --> 38:38.769
and the jury is dismissed.

38:38.771 --> 38:40.537
Thank you all for your service.

38:42.440 --> 38:44.541
<i>Mr. Reston, how do
you respond to allegations</i>

38:44.543 --> 38:45.742
that your company's 5K towers

38:45.744 --> 38:47.744
pose significant health risks?

38:47.746 --> 38:49.146
<i>No comment at this time.
Thank you.</i>

38:49.148 --> 38:51.214
Get me on the next
flight to Beijing.

38:51.216 --> 38:53.049
Business in China, Phillip?

38:53.051 --> 38:54.850
Or are you just trying
to find someplace

38:54.852 --> 38:56.186
that doesn't have extradition?

38:57.488 --> 38:59.088
Reston's a
bean-counter.

38:59.090 --> 39:00.823
He didn't know that
there were problems

39:00.825 --> 39:02.725
with 5K, but you did.

39:02.727 --> 39:06.196
As Caroline's right hand,
you had access to her home.

39:06.198 --> 39:07.697
And Chad Bryson,

39:07.699 --> 39:10.700
he may not have had a .45,

39:10.702 --> 39:12.902
but you do.

39:12.904 --> 39:16.172
I know who you
are, Ms. Morgan.

39:16.174 --> 39:17.907
You here to make
some kind of deal?

39:17.909 --> 39:19.274
Phillip Ward,
you're under arrest

39:19.276 --> 39:21.210
for the murder
of Caroline Mills.

39:21.212 --> 39:22.578
Actually, I came by to tell you

39:22.580 --> 39:24.879
if you needed somebody
to clean all this up,

39:24.881 --> 39:26.281
don't call me.

39:30.820 --> 39:33.322
<i>You, on the other hand...</i>

39:36.226 --> 39:38.159
don't be a stranger.

39:44.800 --> 39:46.434
Hey, lover boy,
your perp's ready

39:46.436 --> 39:48.569
to go downtown,
but let me guess--

39:48.571 --> 39:50.038
You'll handle this.

39:50.040 --> 39:51.806
We're in public, Lionel.

39:51.808 --> 39:53.975
Look, I get it.

39:53.977 --> 39:55.744
After what happened to
Shaw, you and Glasses

39:55.746 --> 39:57.645
are worried the same
thing's gonna happen to me.

39:57.647 --> 39:58.912
And you know what?

39:58.914 --> 40:00.080
It might.

40:00.082 --> 40:02.182
And I'm fine with that.

40:04.620 --> 40:05.886
You don't get to decide

40:05.888 --> 40:08.122
what or who I'm
willing to die for.

40:08.124 --> 40:10.090
I made my choice
a long time ago.

40:11.159 --> 40:13.827
So stop shutting me out.

40:13.829 --> 40:15.562
Yo, Richie Rich, let's go.

40:23.437 --> 40:25.038
<i>Well, this is
the most excitement</i>

40:25.040 --> 40:26.173
<i>I've had in quite a while.</i>

40:27.309 --> 40:28.508
I'm sure you'll be glad

40:28.510 --> 40:29.977
for things to get
back to normal.

40:29.979 --> 40:32.312
Oh, actually, my normal sucks.

40:32.314 --> 40:33.846
I hate knitting.

40:33.848 --> 40:35.915
I think I might
go back to teaching.

40:35.917 --> 40:37.517
And if this school
district doesn't want

40:37.519 --> 40:40.820
to pay me, then I'll--
I'll find one that does.

40:40.822 --> 40:42.955
I think there are lots
of students out there

40:42.957 --> 40:44.824
who could use a
teacher like you.

40:44.826 --> 40:46.559
Thank you, Harold.

40:48.395 --> 40:49.461
For everything.

41:14.721 --> 41:17.289
I've been thinking a lot
about our last talk.

41:17.291 --> 41:18.791
And?

41:20.492 --> 41:22.493
For a long time,
I've been afraid...

41:24.130 --> 41:26.664
to let anyone in.

41:26.666 --> 41:28.733
Trying to avoid
getting close...

41:31.403 --> 41:35.373
to avoid loss.

41:35.375 --> 41:38.042
No matter what I do,

41:38.044 --> 41:39.677
it happens anyway.

41:42.180 --> 41:44.114
Loss is inevitable.

41:45.451 --> 41:48.152
So is love.

41:48.154 --> 41:51.556
It's a basic human need, John.

41:51.558 --> 41:53.958
None of us can go very long
without it.

41:59.231 --> 42:01.698
Well, maybe it's time
for some new habits.

42:12.343 --> 42:14.077
Still no word from Root?

42:14.079 --> 42:15.545
No.

42:15.547 --> 42:18.248
But I shouldn't receive
another jury summons

42:18.250 --> 42:21.351
for quite some time,
so... that's something,

42:21.353 --> 42:23.887
I suppose.

42:23.889 --> 42:25.856
Made some progress
on our missing three.

42:27.391 --> 42:29.592
They were all tight with Elias,

42:29.594 --> 42:32.395
so Fusco and I are thinking

42:32.397 --> 42:34.497
maybe Dominic's the reason
they went missing.

42:36.066 --> 42:38.434
I thought we agreed
to leave Detective Fusco

42:38.436 --> 42:40.036
out of our business for now.

42:40.038 --> 42:42.238
I tried.

42:42.240 --> 42:43.406
But he's like a fungus.

42:47.076 --> 42:50.379
We can't bring anyone
new into this,

42:50.381 --> 42:52.314
but we also can't
do this alone.

42:53.917 --> 42:56.051
A conundrum I know
all too well.

42:57.921 --> 43:00.822
After all, Mr. Reese,

43:00.824 --> 43:03.258
that's why I hired you.
