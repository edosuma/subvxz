WEBVTT

01:06.234 --> 01:09.770
High drama in low tides
at Lake Mead this morning.

01:09.870 --> 01:12.540
A shallow diver searching
for hidden treasure

01:12.640 --> 01:14.642
found more than
what he bargained for,

01:14.742 --> 01:16.677
deadly remains. Sir?

01:16.777 --> 01:18.712
I'm here now with Jeremiah Beck,
the diver.

01:18.812 --> 01:21.315
Sir, what were you
looking for down there

01:21.415 --> 01:22.716
besides the shock
of your life?

01:22.816 --> 01:24.585
Oh, uh, buddies of mine
have been finding

01:24.685 --> 01:27.054
all kind of cool stuff
since the lake dried up.

01:27.155 --> 01:28.589
Mm.

01:28.689 --> 01:30.558
Y'all waiting
for an engraved invitation?

01:30.658 --> 01:32.260
There are human remains
down there.

01:32.360 --> 01:34.495
Let's get to work.

01:41.335 --> 01:44.138
What?

02:03.157 --> 02:04.658
It's a child.

02:12.433 --> 02:13.634
Go for Roby.

02:49.570 --> 02:52.340
Look, it's a dollar bill

02:52.440 --> 02:54.442
in a sealed baggie.

02:54.542 --> 02:57.010
Oh, look,

02:57.110 --> 02:58.212
they doodled on it.

02:58.312 --> 03:00.080
Little smiling little egg. Yeah.

03:01.415 --> 03:03.251
Whoa, look at that date.

03:03.351 --> 03:05.586
1982.

03:18.866 --> 03:20.301
Hey, Greg.

03:20.401 --> 03:22.736
Dr. Roby. You rang?

03:22.836 --> 03:24.838
I get it.
Count Sanders 'cause I asked you

03:24.938 --> 03:26.607
to be on the "vampire shift."
Yeah, you funny.

03:26.707 --> 03:28.442
I <i>vant</i> to make you proud.
Yeah, yeah, yeah,

03:28.542 --> 03:29.743
I know, I know.

03:29.843 --> 03:31.044
Seriously, though, I'm happy

03:31.144 --> 03:32.380
to pinch-hit for your
nightshift supervisor.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.447
Thank you.
I thank you.

03:33.547 --> 03:34.648
Claudia thanks you.

03:34.748 --> 03:36.350
Her new little baby thanks you.

03:36.450 --> 03:37.818
I think I can
lose some sleep

03:37.918 --> 03:39.953
over one new mother's
maternity leave,

03:40.053 --> 03:42.122
but I thought
my reunion tour of duty

03:42.222 --> 03:43.324
didn't start
till tonight.

03:43.424 --> 03:44.758
Okay, sorry
to tap you early,

03:44.858 --> 03:46.026
but I'm in the middle
of a waking nightmare.

03:46.126 --> 03:48.061
Let Count Sanders guess,
body in a barrel.

03:48.161 --> 03:50.731
Mm-hmm.
Rumor has it,
it's an early '80s mob hit.

03:50.831 --> 03:53.334
It's not a mob hit because
the body belongs to a child,

03:53.434 --> 03:54.768
and what I really need

03:54.868 --> 03:57.070
is an anthropologist.
You got one?

03:57.170 --> 03:58.972
Let me grab my cape.

03:59.072 --> 04:02.810
You've come
to the right vampire.
Come on, Count.

04:26.600 --> 04:29.036
Well, hello.
Dr. Roby.

04:29.136 --> 04:30.838
Oh, and you must be
Dr. Hudson.

04:30.938 --> 04:32.940
I'm Dr. Heather Chumani.

04:33.040 --> 04:34.775
Thanks for coming
on such short notice.

04:34.875 --> 04:37.244
Someone show me a pelvic bone.

04:38.646 --> 04:42.015
Boy, you guys did a nice job
of setting this out here.

04:42.115 --> 04:43.150
Thank you.

04:45.185 --> 04:46.754
Mm...

04:48.722 --> 04:51.124
Oh... poor girl.

04:54.094 --> 04:55.429
It's a girl.

04:55.529 --> 04:58.866
It's difficult to determine
morphology of race,

04:58.966 --> 05:02.135
but I do know that we're
looking at a female child.

05:05.573 --> 05:07.207
Based on the...

05:07.307 --> 05:10.210
non-fusion
of the basilar suture,

05:10.310 --> 05:13.146
I'd say your girl was around
eight to ten years old.

05:13.246 --> 05:15.383
Hmm...

05:15.483 --> 05:17.385
What's less certain
is the cause

05:17.485 --> 05:19.653
of this outer scrape,

05:19.753 --> 05:21.522
the right side of the temple,

05:21.622 --> 05:23.056
just above the orbital bone.

05:23.156 --> 05:26.026
Antemortem or postmortem?
Neither, I think.

05:26.126 --> 05:29.697
Probably perimortem,
near time of death.

05:29.797 --> 05:31.665
I don't know how long
our Jane Doe

05:31.765 --> 05:33.501
has been in that lake, but

05:33.601 --> 05:37.037
based on the osteologic reaction
to the temple, I'm thinking

05:37.137 --> 05:39.807
whatever happened
to her face

05:39.907 --> 05:42.342
is the reason why
she's in that barrel.

05:42.443 --> 05:45.546
So, can you bring
our little girl back to life?

05:45.646 --> 05:48.416
All I need is a quiet work area.

05:48.516 --> 05:51.419
I know just the place.

06:47.475 --> 06:49.076
There she is.

06:49.176 --> 06:50.678
Maxine Roby,

06:50.778 --> 06:53.380
meet our little Jane Doe.

06:54.615 --> 06:56.684
We have your face.

06:56.784 --> 06:59.052
Now, all we need is your name.

07:07.928 --> 07:10.998
♪ Who... are you? ♪

07:11.098 --> 07:13.734
♪ Who, who, who, who? ♪

07:13.834 --> 07:16.704

07:16.804 --> 07:18.772

you, you ♪

07:28.982 --> 07:31.184
♪ Are you! ♪

07:36.757 --> 07:38.792
Can I ask you a question?

07:38.892 --> 07:40.460
Yup.

07:40.561 --> 07:43.030
How did the anthropologist
determine her skin tone?

07:43.130 --> 07:44.732
She didn't.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.500
Uh, I mean, she's not
translucent, so...

07:46.600 --> 07:48.836
It's called
"neutral palette technique."

07:48.936 --> 07:51.071
When the race
of a victim is unknown,

07:51.171 --> 07:54.107
the forensic artists use a blend
of all skin pigmentations.

07:54.207 --> 07:56.544
Hmm. Makes sense.

07:56.644 --> 08:00.047
We need an image that's
as inclusive as possible.

08:00.147 --> 08:01.849
Cast the widest net.

08:01.949 --> 08:04.718
We want everyone giving
this girl a careful look.

08:07.788 --> 08:11.859
Yeah, I will.
I will be there in an hour.

08:11.959 --> 08:13.260
Let me call you back.

08:13.360 --> 08:15.896
Uh, what's going on?

08:15.996 --> 08:18.899
It'll come to you.

08:18.999 --> 08:21.334
Oh...

08:21.434 --> 08:23.971
Bryan's art thing. Damn it.

08:24.071 --> 08:26.540
The gallery opening
for his girlfriend.

08:26.640 --> 08:29.309
We were, we were supposed to...
I know, I know. I'm sorry.

08:29.409 --> 08:31.912
You don't have to apologize
to me. I'm just the ex-husband.

08:33.714 --> 08:35.716
I expect
to be blown off.

08:35.816 --> 08:37.618
Bryan, though...

08:39.687 --> 08:40.988
What do you want me
to tell him?

08:41.088 --> 08:43.123
I'll talk to him.

08:43.223 --> 08:45.726
I got to put out my own fires.
Damn it.

08:45.826 --> 08:49.697
I don't see any fires,
but I do smell smoke.

08:49.797 --> 08:51.331
You okay?

08:52.666 --> 08:56.069
They found the remains
of a child

08:56.169 --> 08:58.305
in a barrel

08:58.405 --> 09:00.741
at the bottom of Lake Mead.

09:02.810 --> 09:05.646
It's a cold case.
Gonna be a long week.

09:05.746 --> 09:06.614
Hmm.

09:06.714 --> 09:08.916
They all are. Yeah.

09:10.117 --> 09:12.319
I understand. Um...

09:12.419 --> 09:14.354
Work comes first.

09:14.454 --> 09:16.356
Yeah.

09:16.456 --> 09:20.060
If you just so happen
to get a break,

09:20.160 --> 09:21.862
text me.

09:21.962 --> 09:25.565
We can take Bry to lunch,
make it up to him.

09:27.901 --> 09:28.936
Thank you.

09:31.739 --> 09:33.140
Yeah.

09:41.949 --> 09:44.151
Time?

09:44.251 --> 09:45.552
37 seconds.

09:45.653 --> 09:47.688
<i>Texas Chainsaw Massacre</i> fans
would be impressed

09:47.788 --> 09:49.089
by the way
you wield that thing.

09:49.189 --> 09:52.425
Well, I have been lumber-jacking
since I left CSI.

09:52.525 --> 09:54.094
Really? Oh.
No.

09:54.194 --> 09:57.998
I've been writing a book, but
I do own several flannel shirts.

09:59.532 --> 10:02.569
I've got to wonder,
why so blue?

10:02.670 --> 10:04.738
Hand me the scalpel
and a Q-pack.

10:04.838 --> 10:07.875
Yeah.
I'm gonna get this to trace.

10:12.079 --> 10:13.180
Wait.

10:13.280 --> 10:14.581
What is that?

10:20.387 --> 10:22.890
"Salt Mine Company"?

10:24.658 --> 10:27.460
Salt Mine Company
specializes in the obvious,

10:27.560 --> 10:28.595
sodium production.

10:28.696 --> 10:30.497
Our facility
also manufactures

10:30.597 --> 10:32.700
its own barrels
for transport.

10:33.767 --> 10:36.603
I think what
you're looking for

10:36.704 --> 10:38.638
is right here,
model MHAZ.

10:38.739 --> 10:40.974
Made of
cold rolled steel.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.643
We used them
in the late '70s, early '80s.

10:44.544 --> 10:45.946
That's when you switched
to plastic?

10:46.046 --> 10:47.514
Yeah.

10:47.614 --> 10:51.351
Makes sense,
given the weather and oxidation,

10:51.451 --> 10:53.553
this rock salt
becomes hygroscopic,

10:53.653 --> 10:54.922
changes into liquid

10:55.022 --> 10:56.990
and clumps... up...

10:57.090 --> 10:59.559
You want a job here
or something?

10:59.659 --> 11:01.895
No, we just want to confirm.

11:01.995 --> 11:03.997
This barrel did come
from Salt Mine Co.?

11:04.097 --> 11:06.900
Hon, I suspect
you can read.

11:07.000 --> 11:09.336
We ship all over
the world.

11:09.436 --> 11:11.004
That one with
your body in it,

11:11.104 --> 11:13.140
it could've come from
Munich or Manhattan.

11:13.240 --> 11:15.408
This one was dumped in
Lake Mead, not the East River.

11:15.508 --> 11:17.177
When did you start working here?

11:17.277 --> 11:19.012
Started in '79. Why?

11:19.112 --> 11:21.081
I want a roster of employees
from back then.

11:21.181 --> 11:22.282
Yeah, okay.

11:22.382 --> 11:23.884
As if someone
couldn't have stolen

11:23.984 --> 11:25.185
the damn barrel.

11:25.285 --> 11:28.722
You ever think that, uh,
your kid in the can

11:28.822 --> 11:31.491
might've been some
parent's way of, uh,

11:31.591 --> 11:32.893
getting rid of a problem?

11:32.993 --> 11:35.328
I think this was
some parent's worst nightmare.

11:35.428 --> 11:36.797
Fellas,
I got to go get

11:36.897 --> 11:38.431
a missing girl's face
out into the community,

11:38.531 --> 11:40.000
and you got to get me
that roster.

11:41.001 --> 11:43.904
Or I'll be back.

11:45.773 --> 11:48.408
Dr. Milton Hudson examining
the skeletal remains

11:48.508 --> 11:51.111
of an unidentified child,

11:51.211 --> 11:52.412
presumed missing,

11:52.512 --> 11:54.247
Jane Doe.

11:54.347 --> 11:56.049
Full skeletal remains

11:56.149 --> 11:59.319
came from a barrel
discovered in Lake Mead.

11:59.419 --> 12:01.922
Approximate height:

12:02.022 --> 12:03.824
four feet, four inches tall.

12:03.924 --> 12:07.027
Approximate weight:
60 to 70 pounds.

12:07.127 --> 12:10.597
There are no irregular,
identifying features.

12:12.265 --> 12:14.367
Just who this little girl was,
that remains...

12:14.467 --> 12:15.702
Unknown.

12:18.571 --> 12:20.273
Capitate, hamate bones...

12:21.508 --> 12:23.410
...nearly obliterated.

12:25.045 --> 12:27.014
Is that a gunshot wound?
Looks like.

12:27.114 --> 12:28.849
Can't say which direction
the shot was fired,

12:28.949 --> 12:31.351
but the bullet hit
the right wrist square.

12:31.451 --> 12:33.921
Uh-huh.

12:34.021 --> 12:35.455
Uh...

12:35.555 --> 12:39.292
Perimortem is the theme
of the day.

12:39.392 --> 12:42.295
Looks like a clear, perforated
hole right through the scapula.

12:42.395 --> 12:44.431
Through and through.

12:44.531 --> 12:46.733
Looks like.
Mm-hmm.

12:48.401 --> 12:50.237
Bullet exited her back
and just

12:50.337 --> 12:52.505
kept on going.
It means that she was

12:52.605 --> 12:54.507
probably shot
at close range, right?

12:54.607 --> 12:58.411
All of this damage could be
explained by a single shot.

12:58.511 --> 13:01.481
She's facing the shooter.
Mm-hmm.

13:01.581 --> 13:02.850
Put up a hand.

13:02.950 --> 13:04.317
Okay.

13:05.452 --> 13:06.854
Ah...

13:08.255 --> 13:09.622
Damn it.

13:09.722 --> 13:12.960
That means that it was
the last thing she ever saw.

13:15.863 --> 13:17.497
Okay. The blue substance

13:17.597 --> 13:19.432
from the bottom
of the barrel was

13:19.532 --> 13:21.201
a combination of aluminum,

13:21.301 --> 13:23.971
colored reflective
and adhesive sheeting,

13:24.071 --> 13:25.772
and paint.

13:25.873 --> 13:27.140
Could be a million things.

13:27.240 --> 13:29.042
But who knows,
you can never count out

13:29.142 --> 13:31.578
Locard's exchange principle.
Every contact...

13:31.678 --> 13:33.180
leaves a trace.
Leaves a trace.

13:33.746 --> 13:35.849
Um, well, we can count out DNA.

13:35.949 --> 13:37.450
I ran the clumps
of wavy brown hair.

13:37.550 --> 13:39.452
It's too degraded
for a sample.

13:39.552 --> 13:42.622
Greg, zero.
Penny, zero.

13:42.722 --> 13:44.892
Uh, Greg, zero. Penny, one.

13:44.992 --> 13:48.395
The white Mary Janes
are a youth size 5.

13:48.495 --> 13:49.562
Patent leather.

13:49.662 --> 13:50.998
My guess is

13:51.098 --> 13:52.832
she might've been killed
before or after church.

13:52.933 --> 13:54.301
Sorry, you lost me at

13:54.401 --> 13:55.936
"my guess."
Well...

13:56.036 --> 13:57.704
There's a Sunday school
patch on her shirt.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.606
You sure that's what that is?

13:59.706 --> 14:02.075
Every Sunday,
my entire childhood.

14:02.175 --> 14:04.244
I was an acolyte.
I even taught Sunday school

14:04.344 --> 14:05.378
for a few years. Okay.

14:05.478 --> 14:07.614
Penny, five. Greg, zero.

14:07.714 --> 14:10.583
But these two
rhinestone barrettes

14:10.683 --> 14:11.818
could get me on the board.

14:11.919 --> 14:13.887
This one is in
perfect condition.

14:13.987 --> 14:15.889
The metal on this one

14:15.989 --> 14:18.025
is burnt and twisted.

14:20.327 --> 14:21.761
Doesn't look like

14:21.861 --> 14:24.631
corrosion from being
underwater 40 years to me.

14:24.731 --> 14:27.167
Hard to say what did it, though.

14:27.267 --> 14:30.938
Whatever it was might've made
the hole in this glove.

14:31.038 --> 14:34.841
Here. Check out the photo
of Jane Doe's right wrist.

14:34.942 --> 14:38.011
Look at how the hole
in the glove lines up

14:38.111 --> 14:39.379
perfectly.

14:39.479 --> 14:41.614
She was shot
through the hand.

14:41.714 --> 14:42.882
The bigger hole's
in the back,

14:42.983 --> 14:44.851
which means that's where
the bullet exited.

14:44.952 --> 14:46.920
It makes this
a defensive wound.

14:47.020 --> 14:49.856
I think this confirms a theory
they had in the morgue,

14:49.957 --> 14:52.259
probably a single shot fired.

14:52.359 --> 14:53.626
Wow.

14:53.726 --> 14:56.596
Penny, a zillion. Greg...

14:56.696 --> 14:59.666
like, two.

15:05.405 --> 15:08.541
I really appreciate you
letting us pass out the flyers.

15:08.641 --> 15:09.909
It's gonna be very helpful.

15:10.010 --> 15:11.811
Of course,
we're happy to help.

15:11.911 --> 15:12.980
Is there
a particular reason

15:13.080 --> 15:14.381
Plymouth Baptist
is on your list?

15:14.481 --> 15:15.715
Longevity.

15:15.815 --> 15:17.117
We're hitting
every Vegas church

15:17.217 --> 15:19.186
old enough to have Sunday school
back in the '80s.

15:19.286 --> 15:20.687
There's only a few
of them left.

15:20.787 --> 15:21.821
I'll say a prayer
for you.

15:21.921 --> 15:23.756
I'll never turn down
one of those.

15:44.978 --> 15:47.114
She's just at the end
of the hall here.

15:47.214 --> 15:49.016
So, you're taking me
to the captain?

15:49.116 --> 15:50.350
Yes, ma'am.

15:50.450 --> 15:52.119
Person who makes decisions
around here.

15:52.219 --> 15:53.086
Yes, ma'am.

15:53.186 --> 15:55.122
Uh,

15:55.222 --> 15:57.357
sorry, boss.
This woman...

15:57.457 --> 15:59.126
Mrs. Williams.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.127
Raquel Williams.

16:00.227 --> 16:02.762
Mrs. Williams
is asking if...

16:02.862 --> 16:04.497
Demanding.

16:04.597 --> 16:05.932
To speak to you.

16:06.033 --> 16:09.169
Uh-huh. Hello, Mrs. Williams.
I am Maxine Roby.

16:09.269 --> 16:11.271
I need to speak
to the person in charge.

16:11.371 --> 16:13.506
Okay, I-I...
Thank you so much. Thank you
Mm-hmm.

16:13.606 --> 16:15.175
I am the person in charge.

16:15.275 --> 16:16.876
I'm Maxine Roby.
I am director of the crime lab.

16:16.976 --> 16:20.047
So, you're the one?

16:20.147 --> 16:23.216
You're responsible
for this?

16:25.118 --> 16:27.454
You have some information
about our Jane Doe?

16:27.554 --> 16:31.558
Never mind this damn flyer.
Her name is Phoebe.

16:31.658 --> 16:34.061
Phoebe Williams,
not Jane Doe.

16:34.161 --> 16:36.996
This dollar bill
on her person?

16:38.631 --> 16:40.933
That was money
to buy a book.

16:41.034 --> 16:43.636
<i>Humpty Dumpty</i>
for her little cousin.

16:43.736 --> 16:46.005
She was wearing
white patent leather

16:46.106 --> 16:48.875
church shoes
for the Lord on Sunday.

16:48.975 --> 16:51.678
How am I doing so far?

16:51.778 --> 16:53.813
This...

17:01.854 --> 17:05.492
...is Phoebe Williams.

17:06.859 --> 17:08.595
Your child?

17:08.695 --> 17:11.231
That's right.

17:15.568 --> 17:18.004
I'm her mother.

17:23.776 --> 17:25.512
Mrs. Williams, I am
so sorry for your loss.

17:25.612 --> 17:29.449
And our lab has gone
to great lengths

17:29.549 --> 17:31.418
to try to put a face
to your daughter.

17:31.518 --> 17:33.486
You certainly did that.

17:33.586 --> 17:37.457
And when the race
of a victim is unknown,

17:37.557 --> 17:39.559
our standard
operating procedure...

17:39.659 --> 17:41.728
I may not be in good
health, Dr. Roby,

17:41.828 --> 17:43.963
but my mind
is just fine.

17:44.063 --> 17:46.433
I know why you did what you did.
I just don't like it.

17:46.533 --> 17:48.435
You made my girl
look like

17:48.535 --> 17:50.002
she's someone else,
and then you put

17:50.103 --> 17:51.471
that face everywhere.

17:51.571 --> 17:54.441
That flyer is the reason
we found you.

17:54.541 --> 17:56.943
That flyer makes us
one step closer

17:57.043 --> 17:59.312
to finding out what happened
to your daughter.

17:59.412 --> 18:00.413
And I know
you're upset...

18:00.513 --> 18:02.415
No, don't. Don't.
I know...

18:02.515 --> 18:04.151
Don't tell me how I feel.

18:04.251 --> 18:05.718
You don't know how I feel.

18:05.818 --> 18:09.122
You haven't lived with the loss
of your baby for...

18:14.026 --> 18:16.996
...41...

18:18.998 --> 18:20.800
...years.

18:23.403 --> 18:27.006
You're right. I have not.

18:28.175 --> 18:29.976
1982.

18:31.778 --> 18:35.882
We were shot at in cold blood
in the middle of the street.

18:38.351 --> 18:41.821
My girl's body was taken.

18:41.921 --> 18:44.491
The police...

18:44.591 --> 18:46.693
wrote their damn report

18:46.793 --> 18:50.062
with a dull pencil
on a cocktail napkin.

18:50.163 --> 18:53.566
My phone never rang.

18:53.666 --> 18:55.802
They didn't care
about her back then.

18:55.902 --> 18:59.206
They didn't care.
Sorry for your loss,

18:59.306 --> 19:02.008
my ass!

19:02.108 --> 19:04.477
Mrs. Williams.

19:05.812 --> 19:08.014
Mrs. Williams,
don't walk out on me.

19:08.114 --> 19:11.117
Excuse me.
Mrs. Williams,
do not walk out on me.

19:11.218 --> 19:14.787
Mrs. Williams, you walk out
on me, you walk out on Phoebe.

19:16.556 --> 19:19.125
"They" is me now, Mrs. Williams.

19:19.226 --> 19:23.663
Phoebe is on my watch.

19:23.763 --> 19:26.499
And my watch
does not need winding.

19:26.599 --> 19:30.470
And I will do
everything, ma'am.

19:30.570 --> 19:33.606
Everything within my power
to find the people

19:33.706 --> 19:35.875
that did this to her
and put them away.

19:35.975 --> 19:38.010
But, ma'am,
I cannot do it without you.

19:38.110 --> 19:40.380
I need you.

19:40.480 --> 19:42.582
Phoebe needs you.

19:49.489 --> 19:51.358
What exactly
do you need from me?

19:51.458 --> 19:52.859
A second chance.

19:52.959 --> 19:55.127
A second chance

19:55.228 --> 19:57.464
to make this right.

19:57.564 --> 19:58.931
And, legally...

20:00.433 --> 20:02.168
I need a DNA sample.

20:02.269 --> 20:05.472
A simple swab, ma'am,
just a simple swab...

20:06.673 --> 20:09.709
...to confirm, in fact,
that you are Phoebe's mother.

20:11.110 --> 20:13.212
That's what you want?
Yes, ma'am.

20:13.313 --> 20:15.348
Put a cotton swab in my mouth

20:15.448 --> 20:17.784
to prove I'm her mother?

20:17.884 --> 20:18.818
Yes.

20:18.918 --> 20:21.120
That's what's gonna solve this?

20:21.220 --> 20:22.889
Mm.

20:22.989 --> 20:25.858
This conversation is over.
Leave us alone!

20:30.096 --> 20:32.732
LVPD's 1982 case file.

20:32.832 --> 20:35.668
Photography canvass of the site.

20:35.768 --> 20:37.970
Eyewitness statement.

20:38.070 --> 20:41.140
Site map of where the shooting
took place. The end.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.511
I'm sorry, is that it?
Just a few pages?

20:44.611 --> 20:46.779
Site photos of buildings,
a handful of sketches,

20:46.879 --> 20:48.648
and one witness
statement?

20:48.748 --> 20:51.284
Max is dead serious
about our approach.

20:51.384 --> 20:52.719
We're gonna do what they didn't.

20:52.819 --> 20:55.254
But any old evidence,
we have to bring back to life,

20:55.355 --> 20:57.290
whether we can get the mother
to help us out or not.

20:57.390 --> 20:59.759
Okay, so...

20:59.859 --> 21:02.161
says here
"single gunshot wound."

21:08.301 --> 21:09.636
I don't think so.

21:09.736 --> 21:11.438
I think there were two gunshots.

21:11.538 --> 21:14.073
Second gunshot
killed Phoebe.

21:14.173 --> 21:15.942
First one missed.

21:19.446 --> 21:21.848
If this pencil is our
trajectory rod,

21:21.948 --> 21:24.617
the bullet skimmed
Phoebe's temple

21:24.717 --> 21:26.653
and shot right through
the barrette.

21:26.753 --> 21:28.655
That's two gunshots.

21:28.755 --> 21:31.023
That's twice as much info
as LVPD had back then.

21:31.123 --> 21:32.525
Gives us
a puncher's chance

21:32.625 --> 21:33.993
to learn something
about the shooter.

21:34.093 --> 21:35.462
Height, handedness,
maybe even a general sense

21:35.562 --> 21:36.563
about the weapon involved.

21:36.663 --> 21:38.264
Let's put this scene
on its feet.

21:44.904 --> 21:46.305
Okay, so,

21:46.406 --> 21:48.408
according to Mrs. Williams'
original statement,

21:48.508 --> 21:51.344
<i>she and Phoebe left
the Plymouth Baptist church</i>

21:51.444 --> 21:52.645
<i>for this bus stop.</i>

21:52.745 --> 21:53.913
She said that they
were approached

21:54.013 --> 21:56.282
from the northwest corner,
right there.

21:57.917 --> 21:59.886
I'm the gunman.

21:59.986 --> 22:01.788
Give me a sec
to be multiple heights.

22:01.888 --> 22:03.656
Oompa Loompa to Yao Ming.

22:12.532 --> 22:13.900
No.

22:14.000 --> 22:16.636
No, this doesn't-- These angles
don't make any sense.

22:16.736 --> 22:17.937
You're right.

22:18.037 --> 22:19.439
To get that scrape
on the temple,

22:19.539 --> 22:21.140
it's almost like...

22:21.240 --> 22:23.009
it's almost like Phoebe
would have to be

22:23.109 --> 22:24.276
taller than
the shooter.

22:24.377 --> 22:26.012
Let me stand her up
on the bench.

22:26.112 --> 22:29.616
<i>She's a kid.
She's bored waiting for the bus.</i>

22:30.650 --> 22:32.619
Oh, yes.
Does that help

22:32.719 --> 22:34.721
our height issue?
Yeah.

22:36.222 --> 22:39.025
<i>Folsom, how tall
are our three shooters?</i>

22:39.125 --> 22:40.827
From here, the killer
is five-foot-eight.

22:40.927 --> 22:42.929
Red laser.
Back it up some...

22:43.029 --> 22:45.865
Six foot.
Green laser.

22:45.965 --> 22:47.500
Back it up even more,

22:47.600 --> 22:49.068
six-foot-four. Blue laser.

22:49.168 --> 22:51.203
Without knowing the type of gun

22:51.303 --> 22:54.073
and the exact position
the killer was standing at

22:54.173 --> 22:55.341
40 years ago,

22:55.442 --> 22:58.077
it's impossible
to determine height.

23:02.281 --> 23:03.683
Wait a minute.

23:04.684 --> 23:06.886
Wait a minute.

23:07.887 --> 23:08.855
That building.

23:08.955 --> 23:10.322
What about the building?

23:10.423 --> 23:12.792
That apartment building
wasn't there in 1982.

23:12.892 --> 23:14.494
And that building
on the far corner.

23:14.594 --> 23:15.928
I mean, back then,

23:16.028 --> 23:17.564
it would've been a bunch of
metal and wood.

23:17.664 --> 23:18.898
It would've been a spiderweb
for catching errant bullets.

23:18.998 --> 23:20.299
The bullet didn't stop there.

23:20.399 --> 23:22.769
It hit that office building
over there.

23:22.869 --> 23:24.303
With any luck,

23:24.403 --> 23:26.072
the bullet could be lodged
in the walls somewhere.

23:26.172 --> 23:27.540
Guys, we're close here,
all right? More-more-more smoke.

23:27.640 --> 23:29.141
Let's play laser tag
over here.

23:38.851 --> 23:40.219
Order of magnitude.

23:40.319 --> 23:42.321
It's close enough.
Set up for the mean average.

23:42.421 --> 23:43.990
Six feet.

23:49.562 --> 23:51.397
Hmm.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.066
Hang on, gents.

23:54.166 --> 23:56.068
Allie's getting
into heavy metal.

23:58.204 --> 24:00.707
Scratch that. Now, she's getting
into the blues. No bullet.

24:00.807 --> 24:03.175
Hey, do you still have
those photos from earlier?

24:03.275 --> 24:06.012
The-the one
with the damaged barrette.

24:09.616 --> 24:13.853
You see how the metal from the
barrette is twisted to the left?

24:14.987 --> 24:17.089
The projectile
might've redirected,

24:17.189 --> 24:20.392
like fingers tipping
a field goal.

24:20.493 --> 24:22.428
So, I'm thinking
they need to start looking

24:22.529 --> 24:25.031
a smidge more
to the right.

24:26.265 --> 24:27.333
Hey, guys,

24:27.433 --> 24:28.668
we need to redirect
the angle, like,

24:28.768 --> 24:30.703
three or four degrees
to the right

24:30.803 --> 24:32.071
and a good half a foot higher.

24:32.171 --> 24:33.405
Here.

24:38.010 --> 24:40.580
There we go.

24:40.680 --> 24:41.981
Guys?

24:42.915 --> 24:44.817
Any luck?

24:50.289 --> 24:51.758
Yeah.

24:51.858 --> 24:53.192
Big progress.

24:55.762 --> 24:57.163
With a bullet.

25:02.969 --> 25:04.470
All my sledgehammering's
going to cost the city

25:04.571 --> 25:05.872
a pretty penny.

25:05.972 --> 25:07.173
Please tell me
we found something probative

25:07.273 --> 25:08.474
from that bullet.

25:08.575 --> 25:09.676
I wish I could.
The striation marks

25:09.776 --> 25:10.910
have been severely damaged,

25:11.010 --> 25:12.411
and even if we had the gun
in question,

25:12.511 --> 25:14.480
this'll never hold up.

25:14.581 --> 25:16.649
You're telling me
we found a miracle bullet,

25:16.749 --> 25:20.086
41 years after the fact,
and... nothing?

25:20.186 --> 25:23.155
Not exactly nothing. We know
the killer was about six-four.

25:23.255 --> 25:26.258
And you see
those shiny crystals

25:26.358 --> 25:28.661
along the jagged tip
of the projectile?

25:28.761 --> 25:31.163
Well, I took the liberty
of grinding a few

25:31.263 --> 25:36.502
of Phoebe's rhinestones from her
barrette into a fine powder.

25:36.603 --> 25:38.537
Blingo. It was a match
to the bullet.

25:38.638 --> 25:41.140
At least we know. The bullet
you found was the first shot

25:41.240 --> 25:42.609
fired at Phoebe Williams.

25:42.709 --> 25:45.044
Okay.
What about the second shot?

25:51.483 --> 25:54.587
Thought I told you
to leave us alone.

25:54.687 --> 25:58.991
Yes, ma'am, you did,
but I'm a little hardheaded.

25:59.091 --> 26:02.094
And I have some new information,
ma'am. Some...

26:14.741 --> 26:16.976
I'll put some coffee on.

26:23.315 --> 26:27.319
Last picture I ever took of her
was her coloring.

26:27.419 --> 26:30.556
She would wear
some crayons out.

26:33.059 --> 26:35.762
When she was real little,
I asked her,

26:35.862 --> 26:38.931
"Phoebe, what color
is your favorite?"
Mm-hmm.

26:39.031 --> 26:42.568
You know what she told me?
"Mama, I can't answer that.

26:42.669 --> 26:44.904
It would hurt
the other colors' feelings."

26:45.004 --> 26:48.207
Mm. Mm.

26:48.307 --> 26:51.343
Hmm.

26:51.443 --> 26:53.946
Things you remember.

26:57.316 --> 27:02.955
Now, what's this business
about you have new information?

27:04.323 --> 27:06.893
Okay, ma'am.

27:06.993 --> 27:09.662
I've got some photos
of my own.

27:09.762 --> 27:12.899
So we believe
that there were two shots fired.

27:12.999 --> 27:14.466
The first one

27:14.566 --> 27:18.938
we pulled from a building
near the church.

27:19.038 --> 27:22.008
I'd like to show you a picture
of Phoebe's skull.

27:24.944 --> 27:30.082
There is a bone scrape
right above her right temple.

27:30.182 --> 27:33.285
we believe the first shot fired
grazed her face,

27:33.385 --> 27:35.287
and then damaged her barrette.

27:35.387 --> 27:37.623
May I?

28:06.853 --> 28:09.621
You think
you know what happened.

28:12.124 --> 28:14.160
I was there.

28:14.260 --> 28:16.228
<i>Phoebe and I</i>

28:16.328 --> 28:21.433
<i>used to sell jewelry
and handcrafts for the church.</i>

28:21.533 --> 28:25.471
<i>We were raising money
for a mission trip.</i>

28:25.571 --> 28:28.407
I think you earned this.

28:28.507 --> 28:31.577
Now I can buy that
Humpty Dumpty book for Sharise.

28:32.678 --> 28:35.014
Give me the money!

28:35.114 --> 28:37.549
<i>This kid with a gun</i>

28:37.649 --> 28:39.886
wanted our money box.

28:39.986 --> 28:41.520
<i>I gave him a piece of my mind.</i>

28:41.620 --> 28:42.889
<i>I wasn't gonna let
some evil boy</i>

28:42.989 --> 28:44.857
<i>take the good Lord's money.</i>

28:44.957 --> 28:47.393
<i>I could see the Devil
in his eyes.</i>

28:47.493 --> 28:49.095
<i>And the fear.</i>

28:52.631 --> 28:54.767
Mommy!

28:59.806 --> 29:03.810
I am so sorry, Mrs. Williams,

29:03.910 --> 29:07.814
but we haven't found
that second bullet.

29:07.914 --> 29:11.450
And you'll never find it,
never in a hundred years.

29:11.550 --> 29:13.986
Why do you say that?

29:20.426 --> 29:22.694
'Cause I have it.

29:24.130 --> 29:25.832
The through-and-through
went into you.

29:25.932 --> 29:29.601
Phoebe died trying
to save my life.

29:30.870 --> 29:32.839
I guess you could say

29:32.939 --> 29:36.242
I carry this bullet

29:36.342 --> 29:38.344
close to my heart.

29:38.444 --> 29:39.946
How far would you go

29:40.046 --> 29:42.314
to find the people that did this
to you and your daughter?

29:42.414 --> 29:44.116
All the way.
I need that bullet.

29:44.216 --> 29:48.020
That bullet is the only evidence
that can help us solve this.

29:48.120 --> 29:51.858
When a... when a shot is fired,
it leaves grooves

29:51.958 --> 29:53.159
on the bullet, right?

29:53.259 --> 29:57.196
Those grooves, ma'am,
they tell a tale.

29:57.296 --> 30:03.169
A tale that could lead us back
to the person who did that.

30:03.269 --> 30:07.239
If the doctors say that it will
still compromise your health,

30:07.339 --> 30:11.477
we don't have to do it.

30:11.577 --> 30:13.112
Choice is up to you.

30:13.212 --> 30:15.647
Mother to mother,
let me ask you something.

30:15.747 --> 30:17.083
Yes, ma'am.

30:17.183 --> 30:20.119
If you were carrying this lead
in your chest,

30:20.219 --> 30:23.555
and you needed it to avenge
the death of your boy,

30:23.655 --> 30:24.924
what would you do?

30:25.024 --> 30:27.093
I think we both know
the answer to that.

30:31.463 --> 30:32.731
If you don't want to do this,

30:32.831 --> 30:34.100
we can just call
this whole thing off.

30:34.200 --> 30:37.436
Don't you worry about me dying,
Ms. Roby.

30:37.536 --> 30:40.806
One might say I died
41 years ago.
Mm-mm.

30:40.907 --> 30:41.941
You're strong.

30:42.041 --> 30:46.045
I'm not trying to be strong.

30:46.145 --> 30:48.680
I need something from you.

30:48.780 --> 30:49.882
Name it.

30:49.982 --> 30:51.317
I don't have anyone.

30:51.417 --> 30:54.320
Widowed, no brother, sister,
next of kin.

30:54.420 --> 30:57.523
All I got is this
crooked old walking stick

30:57.623 --> 30:59.825
and faded memories of my girl.

30:59.926 --> 31:02.528
If something was to happen...

31:02.628 --> 31:04.630
I'm listening.

31:04.730 --> 31:08.434
...bury my child...

31:08.534 --> 31:11.437
in her rightful state.

31:16.142 --> 31:19.211
I want you

31:19.311 --> 31:21.280
to make me that promise.

31:24.850 --> 31:26.852
I promise.

31:39.165 --> 31:40.699
Hey.
A little light reading?

31:40.799 --> 31:44.036
Yeah. It's that child's case. Please.

31:45.437 --> 31:47.139
Thank you for meeting me.

31:47.239 --> 31:49.441
I can't stay long, I've got to
get back to the hospital.

31:49.541 --> 31:50.542
We don't have to eat.

31:50.642 --> 31:52.078
Are you ready to order?
Hi.

31:52.178 --> 31:54.480
Single malt neat.
Make it a double.

31:54.580 --> 31:58.217
Mm. That bad?

31:58.317 --> 32:01.720
I'm leaving. I'm leaving you
to your own world.

32:01.820 --> 32:03.655
I don't belong here.

32:03.755 --> 32:08.094
I thought I could unscramble
scrambled eggs, but I can't.

32:08.961 --> 32:10.462
Wow.

32:10.562 --> 32:12.331
I've had...

32:12.431 --> 32:15.034
I've had a day.

32:15.134 --> 32:16.902
I just convinced this woman

32:17.003 --> 32:18.837
to have this
life-threatening surgery

32:18.937 --> 32:20.139
where they're gonna
remove this bullet

32:20.239 --> 32:21.640
that might not solve the murder.

32:21.740 --> 32:24.310
Bad timing.

32:24.410 --> 32:27.413
It's never a good time
to say goodbye.

32:27.513 --> 32:29.015
If it doesn't end bad,

32:29.115 --> 32:31.383
sometimes it just
doesn't end, Max.

32:31.483 --> 32:34.220
Yeah, no truer words.

32:35.988 --> 32:37.256
I'll always be here for you

32:37.356 --> 32:41.627
and for our son
when it counts, always.

32:41.727 --> 32:43.462
I know.

32:43.562 --> 32:49.968
But all the king's horses
and all the king's men.

32:52.071 --> 32:54.373
We both know how the rest goes.

32:54.473 --> 32:56.142
Here you go.

33:32.378 --> 33:35.013
Mom.

33:36.014 --> 33:37.416
How'd you know?

33:37.516 --> 33:39.918
I got you on my phone so
I always know where you are.

33:46.392 --> 33:50.062
My boy. My baby.

33:53.265 --> 33:54.933
Maxine Roby?

33:57.803 --> 34:00.038
Mrs. Williams will
see you now.

34:10.449 --> 34:12.851
Hi.

34:33.004 --> 34:38.177
Go get the man.

34:51.323 --> 34:54.760
It's nearly midnight.
Please tell me you're close.

34:54.860 --> 34:57.529
I'm just comparing
striation marks between

34:57.629 --> 34:59.531
the mangled bullet
that you found

34:59.631 --> 35:01.667
and Mrs. Williams' bullet,

35:01.767 --> 35:03.869
and I can't believe
the difference. Look.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.471
The bullet from Mrs. Williams

35:05.571 --> 35:07.706
is in pristine condition.
Yeah, that makes sense.

35:07.806 --> 35:10.442
After it entered her chest,
the body would have treated it

35:10.542 --> 35:11.877
like a foreign object.

35:11.977 --> 35:14.112
Tissue wraps around it,
protects it,

35:14.213 --> 35:15.514
like a warm blanket.

35:15.614 --> 35:16.915
Lucky for us.

35:17.015 --> 35:18.617
I'm running the striation
marks through NIBIN,

35:18.717 --> 35:20.018
but I can already tell you
we now know

35:20.118 --> 35:22.488
the type of bullet used:
it's a .45 ACP.

35:22.588 --> 35:24.823
Automatic Colt Pistol?

35:24.923 --> 35:27.826
Standard issue, military grade.
Full metal jacket.

35:27.926 --> 35:29.328
Most likely fired
from a government-issue

35:29.428 --> 35:33.932
Remington Rand M1911A1 pistol
from World War II.

35:34.032 --> 35:36.768
So we're looking for a military
man from World War II?

35:36.868 --> 35:40.439
Didn't Mrs. Williams claim
that the shooter was a teenager?

35:40.539 --> 35:43.509
Someone from World War II
would be nearly 100 years old.

35:43.609 --> 35:45.811
Might be looking for
a gun collector.

35:50.148 --> 35:51.583
Hey.

35:51.683 --> 35:53.419
Who told you all to stay late?

35:53.519 --> 35:54.853
Folsom.

35:59.057 --> 36:01.327
The gun that killed Phoebe was
used in a liquor store

36:01.427 --> 36:02.928
robbery in 1961.

36:03.028 --> 36:04.863
It went unsolved.

36:04.963 --> 36:07.233
I thought Mrs. Williams said
a teenager did the shooting.

36:07.333 --> 36:11.303
She did. Okay, so now
we are looking for

36:11.403 --> 36:14.973
two crimes, one gun,
and two different perps, right?

36:15.073 --> 36:17.476
The prime suspect in this old
case was Matthew Beck.

36:17.576 --> 36:22.047
He died in 1973, but his name,
his name lives on, right?

36:22.147 --> 36:23.249
You're thinking
a family member?

36:23.349 --> 36:25.183
Son of a gunman.

36:28.520 --> 36:29.755
This is insane.

36:29.855 --> 36:32.123
19 children and grandchildren.

36:32.224 --> 36:34.526
So we could door-knock
all these people, right?

36:34.626 --> 36:36.027
One of 'em is bound to know

36:36.127 --> 36:39.130
who granddaddy left all his guns
to, or I don't know.

36:39.231 --> 36:41.600
Hold on.

36:41.700 --> 36:43.269
I-I've seen this guy before.

36:43.369 --> 36:45.604
I know I have.

36:45.704 --> 36:47.739
You all have.

36:47.839 --> 36:49.441
Oh, my God, of course.

36:49.541 --> 36:50.976
Oh, my God, of course who?

36:51.076 --> 36:53.379
...skiers didn't
pull me and the barrel.

36:53.479 --> 36:55.681
I got all tangled up
down there. It was spooky.

36:55.781 --> 36:57.949
Are you kidding me?

36:58.049 --> 36:59.518
One thing we know for sure,

36:59.618 --> 37:01.287
killers do return
to the crime scene

37:01.387 --> 37:02.354
to get rid of evidence.

37:02.454 --> 37:03.822
41 years
after the fact.

37:03.922 --> 37:06.758
His dad was a suspect
in a related gun crime.

37:06.858 --> 37:07.893
Will that be enough, or...

37:07.993 --> 37:09.428
I spy something new,

37:09.528 --> 37:10.662
something damning,

37:10.762 --> 37:12.698
something blue.

37:12.798 --> 37:14.833
Screen-grab that net pouch.

37:15.634 --> 37:17.569
Go tighter.

37:17.669 --> 37:20.672
Penny. Penny!

37:20.772 --> 37:21.940
Blue license plate.

37:22.040 --> 37:24.643
Run it through the DMV database.

37:24.743 --> 37:28.179
Pickup truck.
Las Vegas area code 702.

37:28.280 --> 37:30.782
Registered to Jeremiah Beck.

37:30.882 --> 37:32.150
Scuba Steve.

37:32.250 --> 37:33.919
He was right under our nose
the entire time.

37:34.019 --> 37:39.190
And just like a guilty
prize fighter, he took a dive.

37:39.291 --> 37:41.226
Oh, that was forever ago.

37:41.327 --> 37:42.328
I was a teenager,

37:42.428 --> 37:43.729
a salt mine company was hiring.

37:43.829 --> 37:45.063
I think I worked there
for about half a summer.

37:45.163 --> 37:46.532
Six weeks, to be exact.

37:46.632 --> 37:48.233
Until you were fired for theft.

37:48.334 --> 37:50.902
And according to your
disciplinary files,

37:51.002 --> 37:55.240
you were taking barrels and then
recycling them for cash, so...

37:55.341 --> 37:58.209
Not that they weren't all
stamped "Salt Mine Co."

37:59.010 --> 38:02.714
Rifle, Glock, nine-mil, Glock,

38:02.814 --> 38:06.918
and Remington Rand 1911A1.

38:07.018 --> 38:09.054
So let me tell you how
this is gonna go.

38:09.154 --> 38:11.323
My team's gonna head back
to the crime lab.

38:11.423 --> 38:12.791
<i>We're going to dust</i>

38:12.891 --> 38:16.728
<i>every one of those weapons
for prints.</i>

38:16.828 --> 38:19.798
<i>And my guess is yours
will be all over</i>

38:19.898 --> 38:22.634
<i>that World War II relic.</i>

38:22.734 --> 38:24.703
<i>So we're gonna test-fire it...</i>

38:26.271 --> 38:28.340
<i>...and we're gonna compare
the striation marks</i>

38:28.440 --> 38:29.875
<i>on the bullet that we recovered</i>

38:29.975 --> 38:32.344
<i>to the ones fired by your gun.</i>

38:32.444 --> 38:36.782
Your second shot killed
the girl in cold blood.

38:36.882 --> 38:40.118
You were going to
get rid of the bodies...

38:41.453 --> 38:43.221
<i>...but an eyewitness
scared you off</i>

38:43.321 --> 38:46.825
<i>before you even realized
Mrs. Williams was still alive.</i>

38:48.326 --> 38:49.895
<i>And then when you
dumped the body,</i>

38:49.995 --> 38:51.563
<i>you didn't know how heavy
a 65-pound girl</i>

38:51.663 --> 38:54.433
<i>could be in a metal drum.</i>

38:58.570 --> 39:02.073
<i>The water levels at Lake Mead
hit record lows,</i>

39:02.173 --> 39:03.208
and so did you.

39:03.308 --> 39:04.810
You had to get rid
of the evidence,

39:04.910 --> 39:07.145
and you ended up wearing it
on the local news.

39:08.680 --> 39:11.016
Hands behind your back.

39:17.756 --> 39:20.291
Hey. Where you off to?

39:20.392 --> 39:21.893
Desert Palms.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.430
I owe Mrs. Williams a visit.

39:36.675 --> 39:38.677
Ma'am, visiting hours are over.

39:38.777 --> 39:40.779
Yeah, but where's Mrs. Williams?

39:41.580 --> 39:46.485
♪ No, I never felt like
I belonged here ♪

39:46.585 --> 39:49.320
No.

39:49.421 --> 39:55.427
♪ This world wasn't quite
ready for me ♪

39:56.862 --> 40:01.066
