I waited my whole life
for this.

08:27.590 --> 08:29.239
Was this something
you always wanted?

08:29.300 --> 08:33.669
Mama raised me to be a wife
and mother.

08:33.720 --> 08:36.507
Thought that was what
I was supposed to do.

08:37.850 --> 08:38.885
But it just wasnt me.

08:38.930 --> 08:40.636
I wanted my own dream.

08:40.680 --> 08:42.056
What was it?

08:42.100 --> 08:43.340
[laughs]
That was the problem.

08:43.390 --> 08:44.846
I didnt know at the time.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.856
I mean, Ernest?

08:46.900 --> 08:49.858
He always had that land.

08:49.900 --> 08:51.561
Always was so sure about it.

08:51.610 --> 08:52.941
Might as well
have been born

08:52.990 --> 08:54.480
with a stalk of cane
in his hand.

08:54.530 --> 08:55.565
[chuckles]

08:57.490 --> 09:02.280
All I knew is that I needed
to surVIve.

09:02.330 --> 09:05.618
Surviving and dreaming,
two separate things, baby.

09:05.670 --> 09:07.911
Hold on,
I got to write this down.

09:07.960 --> 09:09.450
Girl, I am
just talking.

09:09.500 --> 09:11.456
I know,
but can I record it?

09:11.510 --> 09:12.704
[laughs]

09:14.680 --> 09:17.888
So, what kinds of things
you be writing in that book?

09:17.930 --> 09:19.716
Kinds of things
youre talking about.

09:19.760 --> 09:21.261
Black folks and their struggles
with the land,

09:21.310 --> 09:23.346
our dreams, our family.

09:25.520 --> 09:26.726
Okay, go on.

09:26.770 --> 09:28.761
[sighs]

09:28.810 --> 09:32.189
Well, despite it all,

09:32.230 --> 09:35.358
those fields, that cane...

09:35.400 --> 09:38.699
ended up bringing me
and your daddy closer.

09:38.740 --> 09:43.655
We always knew no matter what,
we had each other.

09:45.290 --> 09:47.861
See? And that what Im hoping

09:47.920 --> 09:51.492
for you and your brother
and your sister.

as all get out.

09:57.680 --> 09:59.136
So howd you find your dream?

10:00.930 --> 10:02.500
I guess it found me.

10:02.560 --> 10:05.518
I mean, I always knew
I had good pies.

10:05.560 --> 10:09.439
I couldnt keep yall
out the kitchen.

10:09.480 --> 10:11.471
But I aint never
really thought

10:11.520 --> 10:14.774
that I would wind up
owning my own business.

10:18.070 --> 10:19.526
I realized...

10:20.950 --> 10:23.157
I never dreamed big enough.

10:24.750 --> 10:26.786
Didnt give myself
permission.

10:31.040 --> 10:32.416
Well...

10:33.960 --> 10:35.666
this is my legacy now.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.421
Your wrist still
bothering you?

10:44.890 --> 10:45.925
Mm.

10:48.940 --> 10:50.680

10:53.480 --> 10:54.777
-Here, do this.
-Yeah?

10:56.570 --> 10:59.061
How do you do all this
and manage lupus?

11:00.160 --> 11:01.775
Oh, no.

11:01.820 --> 11:05.529
Were not talking
about that in your book.

11:05.580 --> 11:07.400
Why not?

11:07.450 --> 11:08.997
Women should hear
your story.

11:09.040 --> 11:10.746
Having it all
and managing an illness.

11:10.790 --> 11:12.917
I am _a black woman
running a busmess.

11:12.960 --> 11:14.916
People dont need to know
that I got a weakness.

11:14.960 --> 11:16.916
I understand all that,

11:16.960 --> 11:20.623
but so many women of all ages
can be inspired by you.

11:22.930 --> 11:24.750
Get back to work, Nova.

11:26.140 --> 11:27.380
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

11:37.530 --> 11:39.896
And dont be overworking
that dough

11:39.950 --> 11:43.067
with whatever it is youre
struggling with over there.

11:47.490 --> 11:49.867
[indistinct chatter]

11:53.960 --> 11:55.951
Damn, dude...

11:56.000 --> 11:58.628
your daddy was doing a whole lot
more than just balling, huh?

12:01.680 --> 12:03.750
Theyre just kids looking
for something to gossip about.

12:03.800 --> 12:05.927
You see the way everybody
is looking at me?

12:05.970 --> 12:08.848
Theyll be moving on
to something else by lunch.

12:08.890 --> 12:10.016
[bell rings]

12:10.060 --> 12:11.596

when youre late.

12:13.310 --> 12:15.517
Meet me at my practice
after school.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.516
We can talk about it.

12:19.400 --> 12:21.231
Keep your head up, okay?

12:30.790 --> 12:33.782
So Im thinking
about a green wall there.

12:33.830 --> 12:35.206
Okay.

12:35.250 --> 12:36.990
-A yellow one there.
-Okay.

12:37.040 --> 12:38.837
And then a purple one there.

12:38.880 --> 12:42.008
And then planet light stickers
for all of them.

12:42.050 --> 12:45.133
What about that wall?

12:45.180 --> 12:46.716
You can leave that wall empty,

12:46.760 --> 12:48.557
so I can draw on it
all the time.

12:48.600 --> 12:50.420
Drawing on your walls?
My goodness.

12:50.470 --> 12:52.973
Oh, and dont forget
about my bunk bed.

12:53.020 --> 12:54.226
Okay.

12:54.270 --> 12:56.226
I want it right...

12:56.270 --> 12:57.476

12:59.110 --> 13:02.432
Thats a good one.
Thats a good place.

13:02.490 --> 13:04.026
I wish I could
stay here with you.

13:04.070 --> 13:06.231
Got to get your room
set up first.

13:08.200 --> 13:10.191
I could sleep with you tonight,
so you dont get lonely.

13:10.240 --> 13:13.038
Thats very sweet of you,
but we cant tonight.

13:13.080 --> 13:14.786
Soon, though, I promise.

13:17.420 --> 13:18.990
Shell keep you company.

13:19.040 --> 13:21.247
Aww, thank you.

13:21.300 --> 13:23.336

very thoughtful.

13:27.010 --> 13:29.638
Slide forward for a second.

13:35.060 --> 13:36.971
You want to tell me

13:57.830 --> 13:58.876
Come on!

14:02.340 --> 14:04.296
-[car starts]
-[radio announcer] Fans, listen,

14:04.340 --> 14:07.924
Donkey of the Day is going
to NBA bad boy Davis West.

14:07.970 --> 14:09.676
He is out here,
continuing to move

14:09.720 --> 14:11.551
the culture of debauchery
forward,

14:11.600 --> 14:13.761
because allegedly
he is a new dad

14:13.810 --> 14:16.631
to a 13-year-old daughter,
and it aint by his ex-wife.

14:16.690 --> 14:18.726
-We want to have a word with--
-[snaps radio off]

14:18.770 --> 14:20.431
[cell phone rings]

14:59.440 --> 15:00.646
Hi.

15:00.690 --> 15:02.510
Excuse me.

15:02.560 --> 15:04.266
You from the EPA?

15:05.690 --> 15:07.237
Can I help you?

15:07.280 --> 15:09.692
Oh, yeah,
we met at the bar.

15:09.740 --> 15:11.025
With Jacob.

15:11.070 --> 15:12.867
Are you guys
from the EPA?

15:12.910 --> 15:14.650
This land belongs
to a friend of mine.

15:14.700 --> 15:16.031
Prosper Denton.

15:16.080 --> 15:17.991
Oh, yeah, with Mr. Boudreaux.

15:18.040 --> 15:20.326
No, maam,
were a surveying firm.

15:20.370 --> 15:22.622
I thought there were
environmental issues

15:22.670 --> 15:24.160
with the land.

15:24.210 --> 15:25.837
No, I dont know
anything about that.

15:25.880 --> 15:27.416
I think Mr. Boudreaux
would know more.

15:29.170 --> 15:31.377
Well, what are you
surveying the land for?

15:33.930 --> 15:36.057
I cant disclose
that information, maam.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.096
Can I get a business card?

15:40.850 --> 15:42.647
Its just a business card.

15:44.810 --> 15:46.687
Can I please just have
a business card?

15:46.730 --> 15:48.061
All right.

15:55.280 --> 15:57.783
Thank you,
"Trent McCallum".

15:57.830 --> 15:59.240
Maam.

16:03.000 --> 16:04.376
Thank you!

16:16.760 --> 16:19.467
Yo, what you doing up here?

16:21.770 --> 16:23.510
Are you good?

16:23.560 --> 16:24.970
Im all right.

16:27.150 --> 16:29.687
Sometimes you just got
to let it hurt.

16:31.780 --> 16:33.236
Thats what
my mom says.

16:39.660 --> 16:40.945
Were going out
after school.

16:42.790 --> 16:44.746
You should come.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.701
You know, hang out.

16:46.750 --> 16:49.332
Get a good shrimp poboy.
Get your mind off things.

16:52.050 --> 16:53.426
What do you say?

16:54.590 --> 16:57.138
Yeah.

16:57.180 --> 16:58.807
Yeah, all right,
Ill hit you up.

16:58.850 --> 17:00.260
Cool.

17:10.530 --> 17:12.816
[Nova]
The diets not so bad, right?

17:12.860 --> 17:14.441
You want that
on record?

17:14.490 --> 17:16.981
You might ask Holleood
that question.

17:17.030 --> 17:18.236
[both laugh]

17:18.280 --> 17:19.770
I already know.

17:19.830 --> 17:22.321
Holleood lives
for Vi and her cooking.

17:22.370 --> 17:24.747
Yeah, well,
its been an adjustment.

17:24.790 --> 17:27.372
The diet, the business.

17:27.420 --> 17:30.162
His minds all over
our wedding,

17:30.210 --> 17:31.950
and hes getting upset
that mine aint.

17:32.010 --> 17:35.173
I got this big dinner
with Rawlings tonight,

17:35.220 --> 17:37.882
and I just dont have time
for all this.

17:37.930 --> 17:39.636
The realities
of having it all

17:39.680 --> 17:41.136
means you got to figure out how
to balance it.

17:41.180 --> 17:42.807
Hmm. What they say?

17:42.850 --> 17:44.477
Be careful what you
wish for?

17:44.520 --> 17:46.056
[chuckles]

17:46.100 --> 17:48.728
Living the dream
means staying strong,

17:48.770 --> 17:52.524
being superhuman
and not letting folks know

17:52.570 --> 17:54.686
that sometimes you just want
to crawl in bed

17:54.740 --> 17:56.947
and pull the covers
over your head.

18:04.330 --> 18:07.208
One thing I do know:
that mans real proud of you.

18:07.250 --> 18:09.286
Loves you more than anything.

18:10.500 --> 18:11.660
I know.

18:13.800 --> 18:16.166
I love that man
more than words, but...

18:18.590 --> 18:20.672
Ijust...

18:20.720 --> 18:22.927
didnt know that I deserved
all this good coming,

18:22.970 --> 18:26.019
and I want to take it.

18:27.810 --> 18:29.141
That aint wrong, is it?

18:29.190 --> 18:31.101
No, maam, it aint.

18:31.150 --> 18:32.765
[cell phone vibrates and chimes]

18:32.820 --> 18:34.276
You take it.

18:36.860 --> 18:39.772
Now whos that got you
so captivated over there?

18:39.820 --> 18:41.560
Why you say that?

18:41.620 --> 18:45.033
Because I know you
like the back of my hand.

18:45.080 --> 18:47.958
And whoeve_r it is
must be serious,

18:48.000 --> 18:49.536
the way you been
fretting all day.

18:50.920 --> 18:52.956
Its complicated.

18:53.000 --> 18:54.991
It always is with you.

18:58.720 --> 19:01.792
Baby, I just want you
to be open to love.

19:03.300 --> 19:06.349
If all this is coming to me,

19:06.390 --> 19:09.052
I know your happys
out there.

19:10.810 --> 19:12.937
Just got to give yourself
permission.

19:21.870 --> 19:24.737
[Trinh]
There were these squirrels
in the public garden

19:24.780 --> 19:26.236
that were crazy huge.

19:26.290 --> 19:28.827
I mean, bite-off-your-face huge.

19:28.870 --> 19:31.168
-I didnt see none of that.
-I do not kid.

19:33.920 --> 19:36.627
-This is incredible.
-Yeah.

19:36.670 --> 19:38.797
I cant believe Ive never
been to this part.

19:40.470 --> 19:42.631
Mom used to bring me
when I was little.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.381
Way different now.

19:46.430 --> 19:48.216
Didnt have all these statues
and stuff.

19:48.270 --> 19:51.262
I love all this.

19:51.310 --> 19:53.687
I majored in Business

19:53.730 --> 19:57.029
because I knew Id eventually
take over the plant,

19:57.070 --> 20:00.813
but I mi_nored
In Art History.

20:00.860 --> 20:02.851
You draw and stuff?

20:02.910 --> 20:04.525
Nope.

20:04.570 --> 20:08.654
Ijust admire and appreciate...
and stuff.

20:08.700 --> 20:11.157
Thought Id curate
at some fancy museum,

20:11.210 --> 20:14.247
like MoMA
in New York.

20:14.290 --> 20:16.497
But I always knew
Id take over

20:16.540 --> 20:19.452
the family business
eventually, so...

20:19.510 --> 20:20.829
I feel that.

20:20.880 --> 20:22.256
Ever since I was a kid,

20:22.300 --> 20:23.927
I knew Id be working
on the farm.

20:25.890 --> 20:28.302
I was real good at track
in high school.

20:28.350 --> 20:31.387
Coach said I could
probably qualify

20:31.430 --> 20:33.057
to be an Olympian
or something like that...

20:33.100 --> 20:34.681
-Oh, wow.
-...had I stick to it.

20:34.730 --> 20:38.268
-Seriously?
-Thats what he said.

20:38.320 --> 20:41.687
Me and my boys would just
hit the meets in the city,

20:41.740 --> 20:43.605
sneak into all_
the college parties.

20:43.660 --> 20:44.854
[laughs]

20:44.910 --> 20:46.866
Sneak in, get drunk

20:46.910 --> 20:48.866
and get all the girls.

20:48.910 --> 20:50.229
Thats how I went.

20:50.290 --> 20:51.746
How old were you guys?

20:51.790 --> 20:53.030
[chuckles]

20:53.080 --> 20:54.741
-Sixteen.
-[laughs]

20:54.790 --> 20:56.746
You were those kids.

20:56.790 --> 20:58.587
Them kids.
Them kids.

20:58.630 --> 21:02.009
Real stupid,
I will say that much.

21:05.340 --> 21:07.001
Excuse the mess.

21:07.050 --> 21:09.211
My ex-wife used to keep
this place spotless.

21:11.430 --> 21:13.887
So my dads friend Prosper
gets a letter

21:13.940 --> 21:16.898
telling him to vacate
because of EPA issues.

21:16.940 --> 21:19.898
But just now, theres a team
of surveyors on his land

21:19.940 --> 21:22.898
who know nothing about
any environmental concerns.

21:22.940 --> 21:25.568
And not to mention _
Im losmg farmers at the mill

21:25.610 --> 21:27.692
who keep having to move
last minute.

21:27.740 --> 21:29.901
Farmers who lease
from Landry.

21:29.950 --> 21:32.942
That sounds like Landry
needs his land cleared.

21:33.000 --> 21:35.070
Did you get anything
from Jacob?

21:35.120 --> 21:37.918
Yeah, he knows the surveyors.
Theyre on contract with him.

21:37.960 --> 21:40.337
Im telling you,
theres something going on.

21:40.380 --> 21:43.201
And well find it.

21:43.260 --> 21:45.922
Look, in the meantime,

21:45.970 --> 21:50.384
I have got plenty of ammo
for you to look over.

22:01.820 --> 22:04.357
You come over here looking
all chewed up and spit out.

22:04.400 --> 22:05.890
Im worried about you.

22:05.950 --> 22:07.906
I know that look.

22:07.950 --> 22:09.235
Same one I had.

22:09.280 --> 22:10.827
And I lost everything.

22:10.870 --> 22:12.235
I just want the truth.

22:12.290 --> 22:13.996
Is that so much to ask?

22:14.040 --> 22:16.827
For everyone
to just stop lying?

22:18.960 --> 22:20.200
Im real sorry.

22:21.460 --> 22:22.745
I saw it on the news.

22:32.720 --> 22:34.347
Thirteen years.

22:37.230 --> 22:38.800
I didnt see it
on his face.

22:38.850 --> 22:43.014
Not once in 13 years.

22:44.980 --> 22:48.108
You need to realize,
you cant change what Davis did.

22:48.150 --> 22:51.199
You can only
find peace with it.

23:09.010 --> 23:11.217
I signed up for a class.
Like you.

23:11.260 --> 23:13.592
Youre going to school too?

23:13.640 --> 23:16.347
I am. But not all day like you.

23:16.390 --> 23:18.597
Im taking accounting.

23:18.640 --> 23:20.471
It teaches me how to be good
with numbers.

23:20.520 --> 23:21.976
Like my math class.

23:22.020 --> 23:23.055
Exactly.

23:25.270 --> 23:27.989
And its important that when
Im in class, Im well behaved.

23:28.030 --> 23:29.770
Thats like my school.

23:29.820 --> 23:31.105
[Darla]
Mm-hmm.

23:34.080 --> 23:38.619
Did Xavier say something
or do something

23:38.660 --> 23:40.457
to make you push him
the other day?

23:44.210 --> 23:45.916
Its okay.
You can tell me.

23:47.170 --> 23:48.876
I wont get mad.

23:56.060 --> 23:58.802
He said you left because
you didnt love me anymore.

24:00.230 --> 24:01.629
[Blue sniffles]

24:19.540 --> 24:22.282
Im sorry he said that to you,
Blue.

24:22.330 --> 24:25.037
But you know
thats not true.

24:25.080 --> 24:26.331
Yeah, I know.

24:28.090 --> 24:30.046
Look at me.

24:30.090 --> 24:35.255
I love you more than anything
in the entire world.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.348
And nothing...

24:37.390 --> 24:40.052
there is nothing thats going
to stop me from loving you.

24:40.100 --> 24:42.432
Do you understand?

24:43.850 --> 24:45.056
Just...

24:46.520 --> 24:48.511
the other kids say stuff.

24:49.860 --> 24:51.521
And when you were sick...

24:53.530 --> 24:55.737
I just wasnt sure
if you were coming home.

24:58.080 --> 25:00.287
I just didnt know.

25:03.080 --> 25:06.038
I was really sad
when you went away.

25:06.080 --> 25:08.833
I know, baby.

25:08.880 --> 25:10.245
And I am so sorry.

25:12.010 --> 25:13.875
Im never going
to leave you again, okay?

25:16.180 --> 25:18.136
Im never going
to leave you ever again.

25:19.600 --> 25:21.261
Im going to be right here.

25:24.060 --> 25:25.379
[Blue sniffles]

25:38.320 --> 25:40.732
Appreciate you
coming down with me.

25:40.790 --> 25:42.189
I had fun.

25:42.250 --> 25:44.036
I needed it.

25:44.080 --> 25:45.206
Me too.

25:45.250 --> 25:46.740
[both laugh]

25:46.790 --> 25:48.200
Me too.

25:48.250 --> 25:50.206
Between work and Blue,

25:50.250 --> 25:52.707
its hard to find time
to break away.

25:52.760 --> 25:54.409
Yup.

25:54.470 --> 25:57.462
Half the time I am running
from the plant

25:57.510 --> 25:59.546
to my aunts restaurant,

25:59.600 --> 26:05.220
and either way I smell like Im
catching fish or cooking them.

26:05.270 --> 26:07.226
Mm, you smell good to me.

26:07.270 --> 26:09.477
[both laugh]

26:09.520 --> 26:12.227
-Okay.
-No, for real.

26:12.280 --> 26:14.737
I like how much youre there
for your family.

26:14.780 --> 26:16.771
Its nothing.

26:16.820 --> 26:20.028
Its not unlike you
running the farm.

26:20.070 --> 26:23.449
Working at the fish plant.
Taking care of Blue.

26:25.830 --> 26:28.993
Most people leave,
dont come back.

26:30.290 --> 26:31.530
You did.

26:37.300 --> 26:41.259
My parents,
they put up a front.

26:41.300 --> 26:44.269
Khanh told me things
havent been the same

26:44.310 --> 26:45.675
since the oil spill.

26:48.310 --> 26:51.188
I think I was just naive.

26:54.190 --> 26:55.430
give it a few years.

26:55.480 --> 26:57.311
The fishll be back.

26:57.360 --> 27:01.114
The community will rally
like they did after Katrina.

27:01.160 --> 27:05.073
I think I just trying
to justify leaving.

27:05.120 --> 27:09.989
So now Im just doing what I can
to make things right.

27:13.960 --> 27:16.087
Sorry, were on a date.

27:16.130 --> 27:20.749
Were should be talking about
favorite movies and worst jobs.

27:20.800 --> 27:22.381
Nah.

27:22.430 --> 27:24.421
I get it.

27:26.470 --> 27:29.098
-Making up for lost time.
-Yeah.

27:29.140 --> 27:31.973
Taking care of the ones
we left behind.

27:37.320 --> 27:39.026
You know, I spent some time
in prison.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.276
I know.

27:44.330 --> 27:46.286
Its in your paperwork.

27:48.540 --> 27:50.656
I was a whole different person
back then.

27:52.670 --> 27:55.412
I understand if it makes you
feel some type of way.

27:55.460 --> 27:58.293
You know,
us hanging out.

27:58.340 --> 28:00.001
I get it.

28:02.010 --> 28:05.138
Why would I be here
ifI did?

28:06.560 --> 28:08.016
I dont know.

28:08.060 --> 28:10.051
Good question.

28:13.100 --> 28:17.776
When I got back I thought
everything would be the same.

Thats sweet.

Its an occupational hazard.

31:41.600 --> 31:43.431
Susy, shes the...

Shall we say grace?

31:56.240 --> 31:58.822
Yes.

31:58.870 --> 32:02.988
Thank you, Lord,

Miss Violet,

32:06.750 --> 32:10.379

-Amen.
-Amen.

32:15.220 --> 32:16.505
All right.

32:16.560 --> 32:18.346
When we first
started out,

32:18.390 --> 32:20.221
Rawlings looked more like
a convenience store

32:20.270 --> 32:21.476
than a grocery.

32:21.520 --> 32:23.932
I was the checker,

32:23.980 --> 32:28.519
bag boy and quality control
all rolled into one.

32:28.570 --> 32:30.936
When Susy and I got married,
we finally had two checkers.

32:30.990 --> 32:32.981
Aint that the whole truth.

32:33.030 --> 32:35.442
Well, I my niece
was on pie duty today.

32:35.490 --> 32:38.448
Yeah, thats one of the reasons
I see so much in you, Violet.

32:38.490 --> 32:40.287
You remind me of my mom.

32:40.330 --> 32:41.820
Jarrett, I aint that much older
than you.

32:41.870 --> 32:44.168
[all laugh]

32:44.210 --> 32:45.780
No. I mean...

32:45.830 --> 32:47.957
her determined spirit.

32:48.000 --> 32:51.788
I see that same spirit in you.

32:51.840 --> 32:54.718
That ability to create something
special out of nothing.

32:54.760 --> 32:56.751
Well, thank you.

32:56.800 --> 32:58.711
She sounds like
a wonderful woman.

32:58.760 --> 33:00.170
Indeed.

33:01.930 --> 33:04.137
Which is why I want
to invest in you.

33:04.190 --> 33:07.011
I couldnt make
her dreams come true,

33:07.060 --> 33:08.812
but maybe I can help
with yours.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.871

like Aunt Jemima, are you?

33:29.590 --> 33:31.410
[all laugh]

33:31.460 --> 33:34.258
I can assure you

33:34.300 --> 33:37.133
No, wed both benefit
from your expansion.

33:37.180 --> 33:39.000

33:50.820 --> 33:54.312
Just have to iron out
the terms.

33:54.360 --> 33:56.601
The split will be more
than fair.

33:59.070 --> 34:01.868
I can have my attorneys
start on the paperwork.
