00:10.401 --> 00:12.621
NO, THANKS.
I'M JUST ABOUT READY TO POP.

00:12.621 --> 00:13.622

00:13.622 --> 00:14.884
HEY.HI.

FAVORITE FRENCH TOAST?

00:19.889 --> 00:21.108
YEAH,
AND HE'S TAKING ME

00:21.108 --> 00:23.066

00:23.066 --> 00:25.547

EVEN SATURDAY.

00:25.547 --> 00:27.636
WHAT, YOU HAVE A SLOW DAY
AT WORK TODAY?

00:27.636 --> 00:29.159
YEAH. KIND OF.

WHEN YOU GET THEM WET.

00:47.569 --> 00:49.571
ARE YOU--YOU OK?

00:57.318 --> 00:59.015
I APPLIED...

00:59.015 --> 01:00.538
TO THIS COLLEGE

01:00.538 --> 01:02.845
FOR A PLACE IN THEIR
SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

01:02.845 --> 01:05.369
WHICH, IF I
DID WELL ENOUGH,

01:05.369 --> 01:07.719
THEY'D LET ME ATTEND
AS A JUNIOR.

01:07.719 --> 01:09.591
WHICH, IF I
DID WELL ENOUGH,

01:09.591 --> 01:11.897
THEY'D ADMIT ME
TO THEIR BUSINESS SCHOOL.

01:12.637 --> 01:14.204
SO...

01:14.204 --> 01:16.250
I TAKE IT
THEY TOLD YOU NO?

01:17.686 --> 01:18.774
THEY SAID YES.

A BAD DAD AGAIN?

01:33.136 --> 01:34.746
NO.

01:34.746 --> 01:37.488
BUT THAT'S WHY YOU'RE TAKING HIM TO
THE EXPLORATORIUM,

01:37.488 --> 01:39.751
TO TALK TO HIM, TO SEE IF HE WANTS
TO COME WITH YOU?

01:39.751 --> 01:42.841
I DON'T KNOW. I DON'T KNOW HOW
TO HANDLE THIS YET.

01:42.841 --> 01:45.322

SPEND TIME WITH HIM.

FIGURE THIS OUT FIRST.

01:55.158 --> 01:57.117

IT OUT WITH OWEN?

PRETTY SMART, BAILEY.

01:58.814 --> 02:00.337

HE'S GONNA HAVE AN OPINION?

ONE IS SUMMER SCHOOL,
MORE WRITING, AND THAT WOULD BE GREAT.

BUT THEN THE ABUSE CONFERENCE WANTED ME
TO DO MORE SPEAKING,

04:06.724 --> 04:08.465

REALLY EXCELLENT.

06:39.747 --> 06:41.401
IT'S JUST...

06:41.401 --> 06:43.620
WITH A MOVE LIKE THAT,
WE JUST HAVE TO MAKE SURE

06:43.620 --> 06:46.231
THERE'S A GOOD,
PRACTICAL REASON FOR DOING IT.

06:49.496 --> 06:50.888
OK, I'LL
DISTRACT MY MOM,

06:50.888 --> 06:53.108
AND REMEMBER,

06:53.108 --> 06:54.239
UM...AND THE ALLEY.

06:54.239 --> 06:56.024
AND--AND PUT A BAG
OVER YOUR HEAD

WON'T RECOGNIZE YOU.

THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN, OK?

08:10.098 --> 08:11.795
YOU CAN ASK.

08:11.795 --> 08:12.840
ASK WHAT?

08:12.840 --> 08:14.842
WHAT'S HAPPENING WITH US.

08:16.321 --> 08:17.627

A ROTTEN GIRLFRIEND, OK?

08:19.803 --> 08:22.371

IN ALL THOSE APARTMENTS, CHARLIE?

08:35.123 --> 08:36.516

08:37.647 --> 08:40.258
EVERY DAY...

08:40.258 --> 08:41.999
IN DALLAS WITHOUT HER,

08:41.999 --> 08:45.525

08:55.535 --> 08:57.841

YOUR FAMILY FIRST?

08:57.841 --> 09:00.409

HEARD THIS

09:15.032 --> 09:16.338
10 MILLION TIMES

09:18.209 --> 09:19.820
OH, YOU SAW THAT.
THANKS.

09:19.820 --> 09:21.778
SO, I NEED
AN INTERN.

09:21.778 --> 09:23.388
THE JOB PAYS
PRACTICALLY NOTHING,

09:23.388 --> 09:24.868
THE HOURS
ARE ENDLESS,

09:24.868 --> 09:28.393
AND I AM NOT ALWAYS
A DREAM TO WORK FOR.

09:28.393 --> 09:29.525
ANY INTEREST?

09:29.525 --> 09:31.005
WELL, UH...

09:31.005 --> 09:33.573

I DO ALL KINDS
OF POSITION PAPERS.

09:35.226 --> 09:36.793

DRAFTING THEM.

09:36.793 --> 09:38.099
OH, OK. GREAT.

09:38.099 --> 09:40.014

OF PUBLIC SPEAKING.

09:40.014 --> 09:42.016
I DON'T KNOW
HOW YOU ARE WITH PEOPLE,

09:42.016 --> 09:44.018
BUT COORDINATING
LEGISLATIVE POLICY

09:44.018 --> 09:46.020
MEANS LOTS
OF ONE-ON-ONE...

09:46.020 --> 09:48.326

REPS TO ABUSE VICTIMS.

09:48.326 --> 09:49.980

THE TRUTH,

09:49.980 --> 09:53.375
IT SOUNDS...PERFECT
FOR ME. REALLY.

WELL, YOU'RE IN HERE.

09:58.423 --> 10:00.774
THAT MUST MEAN
YOU'RE OK RELOCATING.

10:00.774 --> 10:03.559
UH...
RELOCATING WHERE?

10:03.559 --> 10:04.647
D.C.

10:04.647 --> 10:05.779
OH.

10:05.779 --> 10:06.954
UM...

10:06.954 --> 10:09.391
SORRY. WASHINGTON?
NO, I DIDN'T KNOW.

10:09.391 --> 10:11.698
YOU CAN'T DO IT?

10:11.698 --> 10:14.788
WELL, NO, I DIDN'T SAY THAT,
ACTUALLY. UH...

10:17.138 --> 10:19.314
I DON'T KNOW.
ARE YOU ACTUALLY OFFERING?

10:19.314 --> 10:21.795
YES, I'M OFFERING.

10:21.795 --> 10:23.797
PLEASE BE MY INTERN.

10:23.797 --> 10:25.799
START NOW. START
BY FINDING YOUR RESUME

10:25.799 --> 10:29.367
SO I HAVE AN ADDRESS TO START SENDING
YOUR PITIFUL STIPEND.

10:29.367 --> 10:31.108
WELL, UH...

10:31.108 --> 10:33.502
CAN I TAKE A DAY
TO THINK ABOUT IT?

10:33.502 --> 10:35.373
OF COURSE YOU CAN.

10:35.373 --> 10:37.593
YOU KNOW, I'D BE LEAVING HOME
AND MY FAMILY.

10:37.593 --> 10:39.334
IT'S KIND OF
A BIG DEAL.

10:40.378 --> 10:42.816
YOU KNOW.

10:42.816 --> 10:46.210
AND...I'D HAVE
A LOT OF WORK...

10:46.210 --> 10:49.126
KIND OF LIKE NOW, BUT MOST OF IT
I'D BE DOING AT HOME,

10:49.126 --> 10:51.128
SO THE ONLY TIME
THAT WE'D EVER HAVE TO BE APART

10:51.128 --> 10:53.000
IS WHEN WE'RE
BOTH IN CLASS.

10:53.000 --> 10:55.350
AND I KNOW
IT SOUNDS SCARY,

10:55.350 --> 10:57.004
HAVING TO MEET
ALL THOSE NEW KIDS,

10:57.004 --> 10:58.527
BUT I WILL BE
DOING THAT, TOO.

10:58.527 --> 11:00.442
AND SO...

11:00.442 --> 11:02.183
WE WOULD DO IT TOGETHER.

11:02.183 --> 11:03.488
YOU KNOW, IT MIGHT BE FUN.

11:03.488 --> 11:05.534
IT'S KINDA--DO I HAVE TO?

11:05.534 --> 11:08.015
I MEAN, ARE YOU JUST
PRETENDING TO ASK ME,

11:08.015 --> 11:10.234
BUT WE'RE REALLY GOING,
NO MATTER WHAT?

11:10.234 --> 11:12.062
HEY, NO.

11:12.062 --> 11:13.760
OF COURSE NOT.
I WOULDN'T DO THAT.

11:13.760 --> 11:17.154
I'M ASKING YOU BECAUSE I WANT TO KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL ABOUT--

11:17.154 --> 11:19.200
I WANNA STAY. OK?

11:19.200 --> 11:21.768
DON'T WANNA
LEAVE EVERYONE.

11:21.768 --> 11:23.944
I DON'T WANNA GO.

11:23.944 --> 11:26.033
OK, BAILEY? PLEASE?

11:26.990 --> 11:28.644
OK.

11:30.037 --> 11:33.214
OK, I WON'T, UH,
I'M NOT GONNA MAKE YOU GO.

11:43.224 --> 11:44.965
BUT...

11:44.965 --> 11:47.010
THEN WE HAVE
TO TALK ABOUT...

11:48.882 --> 11:50.361
WHAT IF I WANT TO GO?

11:51.319 --> 11:52.450
WHAT?

11:54.888 --> 11:57.281
WELL, IT'S LIKE
WHEN JULIA WENT AWAY.

11:58.718 --> 12:02.156
COLLEGE IS
REALLY IMPORTANT,

12:02.156 --> 12:04.854
AND SOMETIMES YOU HAVE
TO GO FAR AWAY FROM HOME

12:04.854 --> 12:05.942
TO FIND THE RIGHT ONE.

12:06.987 --> 12:08.902
BUT...I MEAN,

12:08.902 --> 12:11.121
WHAT'S IT GONNA
BE LIKE IF...

12:11.121 --> 12:13.515
IF--IF
YOU'RE NOT HERE?

12:13.515 --> 12:16.518
WHO'S GONNA DO
MY ASSIGNMENTS WITH ME?

12:16.518 --> 12:18.215
WHO'S GONNA DO
WHAT YOU DO?

12:18.215 --> 12:20.914
JULIA AND CHARLIE
AND CLAUDIA,

12:20.914 --> 12:22.132
THEY'D ALL STILL BE HERE,

12:22.132 --> 12:23.655
AND THOSE GUYS
TAKE GREAT CARE OF YOU--

12:23.655 --> 12:25.832
I REALLY DON'T
WANT YOU TO GO.

12:25.832 --> 12:27.398
OK?

12:27.398 --> 12:28.878
I REALLY DON'T.

12:45.721 --> 12:47.201
HEY.

12:47.201 --> 12:48.376
HEY.
HI.

12:48.376 --> 12:50.334
WHAT'S UP?

12:50.334 --> 12:53.685

WANTING TO TALK TO YOU AND...

12:53.685 --> 12:56.558
YOU'RE ALWAYS GONE, YEAH, WITH ALL YOUR
INTERVIEWS OR WHATEVER.

12:56.558 --> 12:57.907
OH, NO. I--I'M HERE.

12:57.907 --> 12:59.474
WE'VE JUST BEEN
MISSING EACH OTHER.

12:59.474 --> 13:00.780
WHAT'D YOU WANNA
TALK ABOUT?

13:02.216 --> 13:04.566
WELL...

13:04.566 --> 13:07.221
I SORT OF, UM...

13:07.221 --> 13:08.613
HMM, HOW DO I SAY THIS?

13:11.268 --> 13:12.617
I HAD SEX.

13:16.012 --> 13:17.100
WHAT?

13:17.100 --> 13:19.581
YEAH. I, UM...

13:19.581 --> 13:21.452
I HAD SEX.

13:21.452 --> 13:25.152

13:25.152 --> 13:26.718
WOW!

13:27.676 --> 13:29.373
WELL, UH,

13:29.373 --> 13:31.767
HOW...WAS IT--
I MEAN, UM...

13:31.767 --> 13:33.247
ARE YOU OK?

13:33.247 --> 13:34.857
YEAH.

13:34.857 --> 13:37.120
YEAH, I MEAN,
IT WAS...NICE.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.819
IT'S BEEN NICE.

13:39.819 --> 13:43.126
OH. SO MORE THAN ONCE.

13:43.126 --> 13:44.519
ARE YOU BEING SAFE?

13:44.519 --> 13:46.564
JULIA, WE'RE
TALKING ABOUT TODD.

13:46.564 --> 13:49.263
THE GUY'S SO HYGIENIC, YOU COULD
PRACTICALLY PERFORM SURGERY ON THAT BED.

13:49.263 --> 13:50.394
OH.

13:53.136 --> 13:54.877
WELL, I, UM...

13:54.877 --> 13:57.662
SEEMS KIND OF FAST. I MEAN, HOW LONG
YOU GUYS BEEN DATING?

13:57.662 --> 13:58.838
ARE YOU KIDDING?

13:58.838 --> 14:00.578
LIKE, MONTHS.

14:00.578 --> 14:01.971
WHO ARE YOU
TO TALK ABOUT FAST?

14:01.971 --> 14:03.494
YOU GOT DRUNK AND
HAD SEX WITH JUSTIN

14:03.494 --> 14:04.887
WHEN YOU GUYS
WEREN'T EVEN DATING.

14:04.887 --> 14:06.671
OK. GOOD POINT.

14:06.671 --> 14:08.673
BUT, YOU KNOW,
STILL, IT'S, UH...

14:11.285 --> 14:12.503

14:12.503 --> 14:14.114

FINE ABOUT THAT,

14:22.426 --> 14:24.298
YOU KNOW.

14:24.298 --> 14:25.952
BUT?

14:25.952 --> 14:29.129
IT'S JUST OTHER STUFF.

14:29.129 --> 14:30.739
WHAT STUFF?

14:30.739 --> 14:33.002
MAYBE NOTHING
RIGHT NOW.

14:34.743 --> 14:37.093
IT'S GOOD
THAT YOU'RE HERE.

14:37.093 --> 14:40.096
IT'S GOOD THAT I CAN
TALK TO YOU, YOU KNOW.

14:42.185 --> 14:43.883
YEAH. OF COURSE.

14:45.493 --> 14:47.147

HEY.

15:00.682 --> 15:03.032
ANY PLANS FOR LUNCH?

15:03.032 --> 15:04.773
I THOUGHT WE COULD,
UH...

15:04.773 --> 15:07.341
GO PICK UP KIRSTEN
AND THEN SWING BY THE RESTAURANT.

15:07.341 --> 15:08.646
CHARLIE.

15:08.646 --> 15:10.126
HMM?

15:10.126 --> 15:12.737
ARE YOU ALL RIGHT?
WHAT'S GOING ON?

15:12.737 --> 15:15.262
UH, LUKE'S GONNA
BE BACK IN A MINUTE.

15:16.828 --> 15:18.439
SO?

15:20.397 --> 15:22.573
YOU KNOW, I'VE BEEN PLAYING WITH HER
FOR THE LAST 5 HOURS.

15:22.573 --> 15:24.924
YOU KNOW WHAT
HER BEST WORD IS?

15:24.924 --> 15:28.188
SHE SAYS IT EVERY
SINGLE TIME I GET UP TO...

15:28.188 --> 15:31.147
GO TO THE BATHROOM OR
JUST STRETCH MY LEGS OR...

15:32.888 --> 15:34.977
BYE-BYE.

15:34.977 --> 15:36.631
BYE-BYE, MOMMY.

15:39.721 --> 15:43.507
I LOVE HIM SO MUCH, CHARLIE,
BUT ALL MY FRIENDS ARE HERE.

15:43.507 --> 15:46.032
AND YOU AND...

15:46.032 --> 15:48.295
DIANA AND...

15:49.600 --> 15:52.081
WAIT, WHAT
ARE YOU SAYING?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.778
LUKE LOVES
THAT JOB, CHARLIE.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.432
HE LOVES
LEADING THOSE MEN,

15:55.432 --> 15:57.217
AND WHO ELSE IS GONNA GIVE HIM
THAT KIND OF AUTHORITY?

15:57.217 --> 15:59.132
I CAN'T ASK HIM
TO GIVE THAT UP

15:59.132 --> 16:02.091
ANY MORE THAN
HE COULD ASK ME TO GIVE HER UP.

16:02.091 --> 16:04.746
SO I'M SAYING THAT...

16:04.746 --> 16:06.226
I DON'T KNOW.

16:12.710 --> 16:14.974
MAYBE I REALLY NEED
TO GIVE HIM UP.

16:19.500 --> 16:22.807
I HAD THIS IDEA THAT
MAYBE I WOULD LIKE TO BE A CONSULTANT.

16:22.807 --> 16:24.505
SOMETIME, YOU KNOW?

16:24.505 --> 16:27.203
BUSINESSES CALL YOU IN WHEN THINGS
AREN'T WORKING,

16:27.203 --> 16:30.815
AND YOU GET TO GO IN THERE AND HELP
FIX THEIR PROBLEMS.

16:30.815 --> 16:35.429
AND IT TEACHES YOU ABOUT ALL DIFFERENT
KINDS OF BUSINESSES.

16:35.429 --> 16:37.083
AND REALLY, WHEN
YOU THINK ABOUT IT,

16:37.083 --> 16:38.693
IT'S KIND OF THE STUFF
I'VE BEEN DOING

16:38.693 --> 16:41.000
IN THE PAST
FEW YEARS.

16:41.000 --> 16:43.524
AND THIS GUY
KIMBALL--HA!

16:43.524 --> 16:45.830
HE CAN SET ME UP
TO GET MY DEGREE,

16:45.830 --> 16:47.963
HE CAN INTRODUCE ME
TO ALL THE RIGHT PEOPLE--

16:47.963 --> 16:49.443
YOU KNOW WHAT?

16:49.443 --> 16:51.880
I'M KIND OF THE WRONG GUY
TO TALK ABOUT THIS WITH,

16:51.880 --> 16:55.014
BECAUSE YOU KNOW HOW I
FEEL ABOUT YOUR FAMILY.

16:55.014 --> 16:56.276
YEAH.

16:56.276 --> 16:58.887
FORGET IT. I KNOW
WHAT YOU'RE THINKING.

16:58.887 --> 17:00.541
THINKING THE SAME THING
AS VICTOR,

17:00.541 --> 17:01.629
SAME THING AS OWEN--

17:01.629 --> 17:03.718
YOU DON'T UNDERSTAND.
BAILEY...

17:06.025 --> 17:08.505
I'VE BEEN WORKING AT THIS PLACE
FOR A REAL LONG TIME,

17:08.505 --> 17:10.507
I MEAN,
EVER SINCE...

17:10.507 --> 17:12.248
YOU GUYS
WERE LITTLE KIDS,

17:12.248 --> 17:15.164
BUT IT'S NOT LIKE THE ONLY LIFE
I EVER CONSIDERED.

17:15.164 --> 17:18.994
I HAD OTHER OPPORTUNITIES,
BUT...

17:18.994 --> 17:20.909
I WAS RUNNING
THIS PLACE WITH YOUR FATHER,

17:20.909 --> 17:22.345
AND THE MONEY
THAT WE MADE,

17:22.345 --> 17:24.217
HE NEEDED TO SUPPORT
HIS FAMILY,

17:24.217 --> 17:28.134
SO I HAD TO TURN
THAT STUFF DOWN...

17:28.134 --> 17:30.571
AND AFTER A WHILE,
THEY STOPPED COMING.

17:32.094 --> 17:33.617
JOE, I NEVER KNEW THAT.

17:33.617 --> 17:37.056
WELL, IT'S NOT LIKE I HAD REGRETS,
BUT, BAILEY...

17:37.056 --> 17:38.970
I LOOK AT YOU...

17:40.798 --> 17:42.365
YOU'RE NOT
THE ONLY ONE THERE

17:42.365 --> 17:44.063
TO TAKE CARE
OF OWEN.

17:48.545 --> 17:50.199
WAIT...

17:52.158 --> 17:54.725
SO, ARE YOU
ACTUALLY SAYING...

17:55.639 --> 17:56.858
YOU THINK I SHOULD GO?

17:56.858 --> 17:59.382
A CHANCE OF A LIFETIME?

17:59.382 --> 18:01.080
IF THAT'S
WHAT THIS IS...

18:01.080 --> 18:02.733
THAT'S WHAT IT IS.

18:05.780 --> 18:07.173
[VIOLIN PLAYING]

18:28.716 --> 18:31.110

18:31.110 --> 18:32.633

THE RUBATO RIGHT.

18:32.633 --> 18:34.896

JUST TAKING IT EASY,

18:34.896 --> 18:36.463

ON STYLE.

18:36.463 --> 18:38.160

NOT COMPETING NOW.

18:42.251 --> 18:43.861
WHAT? WH-WHAT
DOES THAT MEAN?

18:48.257 --> 18:51.782
IF I TELL YOU SOMETHING,
I MEAN...

18:51.782 --> 18:53.349
YOU PROMISE
NOT TO GET MAD?

18:55.917 --> 18:58.006
WHAT?

19:01.270 --> 19:03.925
I GOT INTO JUILLIARD.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.796

19:05.796 --> 19:07.450
YOU DIDN'T TELL ME

19:07.450 --> 19:09.235
YOU APPLIED
TO JUILLIARD!

19:09.235 --> 19:12.368
WELL, I MEAN, I JUST WANTED TO SEE
IF I COULD GET IN.

19:12.368 --> 19:15.458
AND I'M NOT GOING.
I ALREADY DECIDED THAT,

19:15.458 --> 19:18.026
BUT...I JUST WANTED
TO TRY OUT AND--

19:18.026 --> 19:19.723
WAIT, WHAT DO YOU MEAN
YOU'VE ALREADY DECIDED?

19:19.723 --> 19:21.769
WELL, IT DOESN'T
MAKE ANY SENSE.

19:21.769 --> 19:24.380

HAVE THE MONEY, AND...

19:24.380 --> 19:25.686

OK, EVEN IF I DIDN'T
CARE ABOUT LEAVING HIM,

19:31.866 --> 19:35.478

19:36.827 --> 19:39.352

GET FINANCIAL AID.

21:00.171 --> 21:01.216
WOW!
YEAH!

21:01.216 --> 21:02.261
ALL RIGHT! GOOD!
I KNOW!

21:02.261 --> 21:03.436
WHEN DO YOU START?

21:03.436 --> 21:05.351
WELL...I DON'T KNOW,

21:05.351 --> 21:06.917
'CAUSE THERE'S
THIS ONE LITTLE WRINKLE.

21:06.917 --> 21:09.833
IT'S, UH...
IT'S IN D.C.

21:11.357 --> 21:13.402
WOW.

21:13.402 --> 21:15.709
WOW. WELL, UH...

21:15.709 --> 21:18.494
I MEAN, SELFISHLY,
YOU'LL BE CLOSER TO ME,

21:18.494 --> 21:20.017
BUT...

21:21.062 --> 21:22.237
YOUR FAMILY, RIGHT?

21:23.630 --> 21:25.675
WELL, YOU KNOW I HAD
THE SAME SORT OF THING

21:25.675 --> 21:27.329
WHEN I GOT INTO YALE,
YOU KNOW.

21:27.329 --> 21:29.636
I WAS KIND OF BUMMED
ABOUT LEAVING MY FAMILY AND, UH...

21:29.636 --> 21:30.854
HAD SECOND THOUGHTS
AND--

21:30.854 --> 21:32.378
NO, JUSTIN, THAT'S
NOT WHAT I'M SAYING.

21:32.378 --> 21:33.857
THIS ISN'T LIKE WHEN I
WAS TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

21:33.857 --> 21:36.033
WHETHER I WANTED
TO GO TO MEXICO.

21:36.033 --> 21:37.687
'CAUSE THIS JOB, IT--

21:37.687 --> 21:40.429
AH! IT FEELS LIKE IT
COULD TURN INTO A CAREER.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.562
AND YEAH,

21:42.562 --> 21:46.043
I FEEL BAD ABOUT
LEAVING MY FAMILY BEHIND, BUT...

21:46.043 --> 21:48.611
YOU KNOW WHAT?
THEY'RE GONNA HAVE EACH OTHER.

21:48.611 --> 21:51.222
THEY'RE GONNA BE HERE,
AND THEY'RE GONNA BE TOGETHER.

21:51.222 --> 21:55.401
SO, NO, I JUST--I WANT TO MAKE
SURE I CAN FIGURE OUT ALL THE DETAILS,

21:55.401 --> 21:58.621
YOU KNOW, 'CAUSE ASSUMING
IT ALL MAKES SENSE...

21:58.621 --> 21:59.883
I'M GOING.

21:59.883 --> 22:00.884
YOU'RE GOING.

22:00.884 --> 22:02.625
I'M GOING, YEAH.

22:08.370 --> 22:10.285
Bailey: SO I GOT A QUESTION
I GOTTA ASK YOU.

22:12.679 --> 22:14.333
YOU KNOW HOW...

22:14.333 --> 22:17.031
I'VE BEEN TALKING
ABOUT MAYBE GOING BACK TO SCHOOL?

22:19.338 --> 22:21.470
WELL...

22:21.470 --> 22:23.994
SAY I GOT
INTO A COLLEGE...

22:23.994 --> 22:26.910
WITH A REAL SHOT
AT GETTING A BUSINESS DEGREE

22:26.910 --> 22:28.999
THAT I COULDN'T
GET ANYWHERE ELSE.

22:30.958 --> 22:33.569
WELL...IT SOUNDS GREAT.

22:35.484 --> 22:37.660
BUT...

22:37.660 --> 22:38.966
SAY...

22:38.966 --> 22:41.229
IT'S IN PENNSYLVANIA?

22:45.364 --> 22:47.366
AT THE UNIVERSITY
OF PENNSYLVANIA.

22:48.671 --> 22:50.281
PENNSYLVANIA.

22:50.281 --> 22:51.370
YEAH.

22:53.502 --> 22:56.287
WAIT. WAIT A SECOND.

22:56.287 --> 22:57.550
WHEN DID THIS
HAPPEN?

22:57.550 --> 22:59.900
I MADE A COUPLE
OF PHONE CALLS

22:59.900 --> 23:01.467
THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS.

23:01.467 --> 23:04.208
SO IT WAS AFTER
I ASKED YOU TO PARTNER UP WITH ME.

23:04.208 --> 23:06.385
CHARLIE, WAIT--WHY THE HELL DIDN'T
YOU SAY ANYTHING?

23:06.385 --> 23:07.734
YOU SAID YOU WERE
THINKING ABOUT IT,

23:07.734 --> 23:09.257
BUT YOU WEREN'T
REALLY THINKING ABOUT IT.

23:09.257 --> 23:11.259
NO--YOU KNOW, JUST...

23:11.259 --> 23:12.391
FORGET IT.

23:16.003 --> 23:18.484
AND WHAT ABOUT OWEN?

23:18.484 --> 23:22.401
HE DOESN'T WANT
TO COME WITH ME, SO...

23:22.401 --> 23:25.621
I-I'M JUST HAVING A REALLY HARD TIME
WITH THIS WHOLE THING,

23:25.621 --> 23:27.057
BECAUSE I...

23:27.057 --> 23:29.016
I DON'T KNOW
WHAT I'M SUPPOSED TO DO.

23:29.016 --> 23:32.889
I MEAN, AM I SUPPOSED
TO GIVE UP A CHANCE LIKE THIS...

23:32.889 --> 23:35.762
JUST SO THINGS CAN
STAY CONSISTENT FOR HIM?

23:35.762 --> 23:37.546
CONSISTENT?

23:37.546 --> 23:40.070
BAILEY, YOU ALMOST TORE APART THE FAMILY
TO GET HIM FROM ME,

23:40.070 --> 23:41.898
AND NOW YOU'RE ASKING JUST
TO HAND HIM OFF AGAIN?

23:41.898 --> 23:44.510
IF YOU THINK
THIS IS EASY FOR ME...

23:45.380 --> 23:46.947
LOOK...

23:46.947 --> 23:49.471
IF I DON'T TAKE
THIS THING RIGHT NOW...

23:49.471 --> 23:52.213
IF I WAIT TILL OWEN
IS GROWN UP AND OUT OF THE HOUSE,

23:52.213 --> 23:55.608
THEN I'LL BE, WHAT,
I'LL BE--I'LL BE IN MY MID-THIRTIES

23:55.608 --> 23:58.611
BEFORE I CAN EVEN THINK OF
SOMETHING LIKE THIS AGAIN.

23:58.611 --> 24:00.439
I WILL BE STARTING
MY WAY UP THE LADDER

24:00.439 --> 24:02.789
WHEN GUYS MY AGE ARE
ALREADY HALFWAY TO THE TOP.

24:04.355 --> 24:06.096
WELL...

24:06.096 --> 24:08.490
I'M SORRY,
BUT I'M NOT GONNA JUST ROLL OVER

24:08.490 --> 24:09.883
AND MAKE THIS OK
FOR YOU.

24:09.883 --> 24:12.407
I'M NOT GONNA
JUST LET YOU HAND OWEN OFF

24:12.407 --> 24:15.845
JUST SO YOU CAN FEEL FREE
TO CHASE WHATEVER FANTASY YOU HAVE.

24:15.845 --> 24:18.108
RAISING KIDS IS
A LIFETIME COMMITMENT, BAILEY.

24:18.108 --> 24:19.545
AND THE PEOPLE
THAT MAKE THAT COMMITMENT,

24:19.545 --> 24:21.024
THEY GIVE UP THINGS
ALL THE TIME.

24:21.024 --> 24:23.766
LOOK-- WHAT, YOU THINK
YOU OWE HIM ANYTHING LESS?

24:26.247 --> 24:28.467
AM I WRONG?

24:32.862 --> 24:35.299
NO, YOU'RE NOT WRONG.

24:47.050 --> 24:50.053
Julia: MAN, LOOK AT EVERYTHING
I CAN DO ONLINE.

24:50.053 --> 24:52.534
I CAN LOG ONTO THE PAPER
IN WASHINGTON

24:52.534 --> 24:54.318
AND CHECK OUT
CLASSIFIEDS.

24:54.318 --> 24:56.407
THEY'VE EVEN GOT FLOOR PLANS FOR SOME
OF THESE APARTMENTS.

24:56.407 --> 24:58.932
YOU THINK A ONE-BEDROOM
IS TOO BIG FOR ME?

24:58.932 --> 25:00.890
MMM, I DON'T KNOW.

25:00.890 --> 25:03.023
THEY TELL YOU
ABOUT THE NEIGHBORHOODS?

25:03.023 --> 25:04.677
WHAT ABOUT THEM?

25:04.677 --> 25:07.114
YOU KNOW,
HOW SAFE THEY ARE.

25:07.114 --> 25:08.245
CRIME STATISTICS.

25:08.245 --> 25:10.552
JUSTIN,
CRIME STATISTICS?

25:10.552 --> 25:11.684
HEY.

25:11.684 --> 25:12.772
HA!

25:12.772 --> 25:15.078
MY FIRST APARTMENT
IN NEW HAVEN.

25:15.078 --> 25:17.994
I FOUND THIS GREAT DEAL
ON A STUDIO.

25:17.994 --> 25:19.648
TURNS OUT THE REASON WAS,

25:19.648 --> 25:21.476
THIS STRIP JOINT NEARBY

25:21.476 --> 25:25.132
WAS KEEPING A UNIT
FOR GIRLS TO TURN TRICKS.

25:25.132 --> 25:27.003
REALLY. IT WAS JUST
RIGHT DOWN THE HALL.

25:27.003 --> 25:29.005
GUYS WOULD BE AT MY DOOR
ALL NIGHT LONG,

25:29.005 --> 25:31.007
"HEY, MAN, YOU GOT
CHANGE FOR A HUNDRED?

25:31.007 --> 25:32.748
DUDE, BE A BUDDY
AND LOAN ME A CONDOM."

25:32.748 --> 25:33.923
WOW, REALLY?

25:33.923 --> 25:35.185
YEAH.

25:35.185 --> 25:37.274
YOU KNOW,
I'M JUST SAYING.

25:37.274 --> 25:39.842
LET'S NOT FORGET WEATHER.

25:39.842 --> 25:40.930
WEATHER?

25:40.930 --> 25:42.758
YEAH, SURE.

25:42.758 --> 25:44.020
YOU KNOW, SUMMERTIME,

25:44.020 --> 25:47.154
YOU'RE TALKING 110,

25:47.154 --> 25:49.460
100% HUMIDITY.

25:49.460 --> 25:51.045
PEOPLE DROP DEAD
IN THAT WEATHER.

25:51.055 --> 25:52.333
HEART ATTACKS
LEFT AND RIGHT.

25:52.333 --> 25:53.726
JUSTIN--

25:53.726 --> 25:55.554
AND I DIDN'T EVEN
MENTION WINTER, YOU KNOW.

25:55.554 --> 25:58.121
WITH WIND CHILL YOU'RE
GETTING DOWN TO, LIKE, -50.

25:58.121 --> 25:59.601
JUSTIN, WHAT ARE YOU
TALKING ABOUT?

25:59.601 --> 26:00.689
HMM?

26:00.689 --> 26:01.690
YOU KNOW,
IF YOU DON'T THINK

26:01.690 --> 26:02.778
I CAN HANDLE THIS
ON MY OWN,

26:02.778 --> 26:04.040
WHY DON'T YOU
JUST SAY SO?

26:04.040 --> 26:07.217
NO, NO, NO. I'M JUST--

26:07.217 --> 26:10.351
I'M JUST WORRIED ABOUT YOU.

26:10.351 --> 26:12.483
GOING EAST
WAS A BIG DEAL FOR ME.

26:12.483 --> 26:13.876
I MEAN,

26:13.876 --> 26:18.881
I WISH I COULD BE THERE
WITH YOU, YOU KNOW?

26:18.881 --> 26:20.404
IF IT MADE IT ANY EASIER,

26:20.404 --> 26:22.711
YOU KNOW, I'D BE GLAD
TO COME JUST TO--

26:22.711 --> 26:25.148
OK. YOU KNOW WHAT?

26:25.148 --> 26:26.497
I UNDERSTAND.

26:27.368 --> 26:30.545
BUT I'M GONNA BE OK.

26:31.415 --> 26:32.416
YOU SURE?

26:32.416 --> 26:33.417
YEAH.

26:34.505 --> 26:36.682
YEAH,
I'M GONNA BE FINE.

26:47.475 --> 26:49.303
YOUR DESIGNER WAS
IN HERE YESTERDAY,

26:49.303 --> 26:52.698
AND SHE THOUGHT THAT
THIS OR THE HOSKINS

26:52.698 --> 26:54.525
WOULD WORK WELL
IN YOUR LIVING ROOM.

26:54.525 --> 26:55.962
SO WHY DON'T YOU
TAKE A LOOK AROUND

26:55.962 --> 26:58.747
AND COME GET ME
IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS.

26:59.661 --> 27:01.358
UH, I HAVE A QUESTION.

27:01.358 --> 27:03.622
BAILEY! HEY,
IT'S GOOD TO SEE YOU.

27:03.622 --> 27:06.015
LISTEN, I GOT A CALL
FROM A FRIEND IN ADMISSIONS.

27:06.015 --> 27:07.843
THEY STILL HAVEN'T
HEARD FROM YOU YET.YEAH.

27:07.843 --> 27:09.453
NO PRESSURE,
BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW

27:09.453 --> 27:11.238
WHAT SPECIAL ATTENTION
YOU'RE GETTING HERE.

27:11.238 --> 27:13.501
I MEAN, NORMALLY, THEY
DON'T HOLD SPACES LIKE THIS.

27:13.501 --> 27:14.807
I KNOW, AND I APPRECIATE

27:14.807 --> 27:16.722
EVERYTHING THAT
THEY'RE DOING, AND YOU,

27:16.722 --> 27:18.680
BUT I SORT OF,

27:18.680 --> 27:20.247
UM...

27:20.247 --> 27:22.945
I WAS WONDERING IF MAYBE
THERE'S SOMEPLACE ELSE

27:22.945 --> 27:24.425
THAT I COULD APPLY TO?

27:24.425 --> 27:25.426
WHAT?

27:25.426 --> 27:27.167
SOMEPLACE CLOSER.

27:27.167 --> 27:28.472
LIKE IN SAN FRANCISCO.

27:28.472 --> 27:30.779
YOU WANT TO GIVE UP
A SHOT AT WHARTON

27:30.779 --> 27:32.041
TO STAY CLOSE TO HOME?

27:32.041 --> 27:35.218
YOU--YOU KIND OF
DON'T KNOW MY SITUATION.

27:35.218 --> 27:36.785
THE FAMILY
THAT I LIVE IN.

27:36.785 --> 27:38.265
IS SOMEBODY SICK?NO.

27:38.265 --> 27:39.527
IS IT MONEY?

27:39.527 --> 27:40.876
BECAUSE WE CAN
ALWAYS GET YOU SOME AID.

27:40.876 --> 27:43.662
IT'S NONE OF THAT STUFF,
OK? IT'S JUST...

27:43.662 --> 27:46.099
IT'S MY FAMILY.

27:46.099 --> 27:47.883
SO I'M WONDERING--

27:47.883 --> 27:49.842
ISN'T THERE
ANYPLACE LOCAL?

27:49.842 --> 27:52.758
ISN'T THERE A SCHOOL
NEAR HERE THAT YOU COULD RECOMMEND?

27:52.758 --> 27:55.151
IF YOU'RE SAYING THAT
YOU CAN'T LEAVE THE CITY,

27:55.151 --> 27:56.805
YOU KNOW WHAT PERCENT
OF THE FORTUNE 500

27:56.805 --> 27:58.111
ARE BASED IN THIS CITY?

27:58.111 --> 28:00.548
JUST A SLIVER.
A FRACTION.

28:00.548 --> 28:02.855
THIS IS WHERE
I CAN HELP YOU.

28:02.855 --> 28:04.944
OK, AND IT'S
A DAMN GOOD SCHOOL.

28:04.944 --> 28:07.207
IT'S NOT LIKE IT'S ONE
OF A LOT OF CHOICES.

28:07.207 --> 28:09.383
IT IS THE CHOICE.

28:09.383 --> 28:11.907
YOU DON'T WANT
TO THROW THIS AWAY.

28:26.356 --> 28:27.749
HEY.

28:27.749 --> 28:30.230
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN?

28:30.230 --> 28:33.363
WE HAD A SESSION.
I THOUGHT YOU'D BE THERE.

28:33.363 --> 28:35.714
UM, YOU KNOW, I--

28:35.714 --> 28:37.541
I HAD SOME STUFF
TO TAKE CARE OF.

28:37.541 --> 28:40.022
REALLY? YOU LOOKING
FOR APARTMENTS FOR US?

28:40.022 --> 28:41.241
WHAT?

28:41.241 --> 28:42.242
FOR NEXT YEAR.

28:42.242 --> 28:43.678
REMEMBER THAT PLAN?

28:45.288 --> 28:47.334
ROSS CAME BY THE STUDIO,
CLAUDIA.

28:47.334 --> 28:50.380
BROUGHT YOU A SCHOLARSHIP
APPLICATION FOR FRALEY TO SIGN.

28:50.380 --> 28:52.905
LISTEN, TODD, I--

28:52.905 --> 28:55.690
I HAPPENED TO MENTION TO ROSS THAT
I GOT INTO JUILLIARD.

28:55.690 --> 28:57.910
I MEAN, I TOLD HIM
I COULDN'T AFFORD IT,

28:57.910 --> 29:00.739
BUT HE MADE IT LIKE HIS PERSONAL MISSION
TO MAKE SURE THAT I GO.

29:00.739 --> 29:03.872
I SAW THE APPLICATION,
CLAUDIA.

29:03.872 --> 29:05.744
IT HAD
YOUR SIGNATURE ON IT.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.223
TODD, LISTEN.

29:07.223 --> 29:08.964
I MEAN,
YOU HAVE TO BELIEVE ME.

29:08.964 --> 29:10.836
I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE
HERE. I DON'T.

29:10.836 --> 29:13.229
WELL, THAT'S
NOT VERY SMART.

29:13.229 --> 29:14.361
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

29:14.361 --> 29:16.232
CLAUD,
I'VE TOLD YOU BEFORE.

29:16.232 --> 29:20.019
I MEAN, YOU'D HAVE TO BE OUT OF YOUR MIND
TO PASS UP THIS CHANCE.

29:20.019 --> 29:22.673
TO PLAY WITH THE BEST MUSICIANS
IN THE WHOLE COUNTRY?

29:22.673 --> 29:25.154
OH, I KNOW. I'M NOT SAYING
I DON'T SEE THE VALUE--

29:25.154 --> 29:26.547
I'D GO.

29:27.461 --> 29:29.419
I MEAN, IF I WERE YOU,

29:29.419 --> 29:31.073
I'D BE REALLY SAD,
BUT I'D--

29:31.073 --> 29:33.467
I'D SAY GOOD-BYE,
AND I'D LEAVE.

29:34.337 --> 29:35.643
I'D GO.

29:37.906 --> 29:39.255
THERE.

29:39.255 --> 29:41.083
JUSTIN, I CAN'T SEE
IN THIS THING OR BREATH.

29:41.083 --> 29:44.217
OH, YEAH, AND YOU NEED
SOME OF THESE ICE SHOES, TOO.

29:44.217 --> 29:45.827
ICE SHOES WITH SPIKES?

29:45.827 --> 29:47.176
YEAH. OH, MAN,

29:47.176 --> 29:50.136
I'VE SEEN QUADS FREEZE
UP LIKE SKATING RINKS.

29:50.136 --> 29:52.442
I MEAN, I'VE SEEN GROWN MEN
GO DOWN ON THAT ICE

29:52.442 --> 29:53.704
AND THEY NEVER GET UP.

29:53.704 --> 29:55.010
THEIR HEADS
HIT THE GROUND,

29:55.010 --> 29:56.272
AND IT SOUNDS
LIKE COCONUT DRUMS.

29:56.272 --> 29:57.883
JUSTIN, STOP, OK?

29:57.883 --> 29:59.232
WHAT?

29:59.232 --> 30:01.277
IN THE LAST 60 MINUTES,
I HAVE BEEN LECTURED

30:01.277 --> 30:04.106
ON SELF-DEFENSE,
POPULAR SCAMS BY THE CABLE GUY,

30:04.106 --> 30:06.630
HOW TO TELL JUNK MAIL
FROM LETTER BOMBS,

30:06.630 --> 30:08.415
AND IT'S STARTING TO GET
JUST A LITTLE INSULTING.

30:08.415 --> 30:09.633
YOU REALLY THINK
I'M THAT CLUELESS?

30:09.633 --> 30:11.157
WELL, YEAH, KINDA.

30:11.157 --> 30:12.245
WHAT?

30:12.245 --> 30:13.289
LOOK, I HAVE BEEN DROPPING,

30:13.289 --> 30:14.508
LIKE, 10 MILLION HINTS.

30:14.508 --> 30:15.988
NO, I KNOW. I HEARD.

30:15.988 --> 30:17.467
HOW TO TELL WHETHER
YOUR LANDLORD IS STEALING

30:17.467 --> 30:19.034
YOUR VICTORIA'S SECRET
CATALOGS.

30:19.034 --> 30:20.557
HOW TO SET UP
YOUR OWN HOME ALARM.

30:20.557 --> 30:22.211
NOT THAT, ABOUT--WHAT?

30:22.211 --> 30:24.300
OH, COME ON.
ISN'T IT OBVIOUS?

30:24.300 --> 30:25.388
ASK ME.

30:25.388 --> 30:26.476
ASK YOU WHAT?

30:26.476 --> 30:28.304
IF I WANT TO COME.COME WHERE?

30:28.304 --> 30:30.176
TO D.C.! IF I WANT
TO COME TO D.C. WITH YOU.

30:30.176 --> 30:31.786
YOU WANT
TO COME TO D.C.?

30:31.786 --> 30:33.266
NO, NOT LIKE THAT.
LIKE YOU MEAN IT.

30:33.266 --> 30:34.833
BUT, JUSTIN,
YOU STILL HAVE A YEAR LEFT AT YALE.

30:34.833 --> 30:36.008
NOT NECESSARILY.

30:36.008 --> 30:38.401
I MEAN, YOU KNOW,
I COULD TRANSFER.

30:38.401 --> 30:42.144
WHERE? I MEAN, YALE HAS THAT INCREDIBLE
ENGLISH DEPARTMENT.

30:42.144 --> 30:43.537
GEORGETOWN.

30:43.537 --> 30:46.540
I MEAN, I KNOW IT'S
NOT AS INCREDIBLE, BUT...

30:46.540 --> 30:48.324
THAT'S WHY I NEED YOU
TO ASK ME,

30:48.324 --> 30:52.198
'CAUSE THEN I WOULD
BE LEAVING FOR YOU.

30:52.198 --> 30:55.854
I COULD JUSTIFY
GIVING IT UP FOR YOU.

31:00.684 --> 31:02.991
[LAUGHS]

31:05.231 --> 31:08.867
NO, I DIDN'T DO THE INVOICES.
SOMEONE ELSE WAS GOING TO.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.694
YEAH, I GUESS HE WAS.

31:12.153 --> 31:13.438
ALL RIGHT.

31:13.478 --> 31:16.744
WELL, I'LL ASK HIM
WHEN I SEE HIM.

31:16.744 --> 31:18.441
THANKS. BYE.

31:19.921 --> 31:21.880
WHAT HAPPENED?

31:21.880 --> 31:24.360
THOSE INVOICES HAD
TO GO OUT TONIGHT.

31:27.015 --> 31:28.843
I'M SORRY.

31:28.843 --> 31:30.453
I CUT OUT EARLY.

31:30.453 --> 31:32.064
I HAD SOME STUFF
ON MY MIND.

31:32.064 --> 31:33.717
YOU KNOW, BAILEY,
I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU

31:33.717 --> 31:36.895
HAD ANY OBLIGATION TO ME
TO SIGN ON AS MY PARTNER.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.853
YOU COULD WALK OUT THAT DOOR
WHENEVER YOU WANTED.

31:38.853 --> 31:41.160
- I KNOW.
- IT SURE WOULD BE NICE

31:41.160 --> 31:42.480
IF YOU'D FINISH THE WORK
THAT YOU STARTED.

31:42.520 --> 31:43.814
NO, OF COURSE, BUT--

31:43.814 --> 31:45.381
AS FAR
AS OWEN IS CONCERNED--

31:45.381 --> 31:48.515
YOU DON'T NEED TO KEEP LECTURING ME
ABOUT OWEN, OK?

31:50.343 --> 31:54.390
LOOK. LISTEN, YOU WANT ME TO SAY
THAT I MADE A MISTAKE

31:54.390 --> 31:56.392
FIGHTING YOU
FOR CUSTODY LAST YEAR?

31:56.392 --> 31:58.090
FINE. I DID. OK?

31:58.090 --> 31:59.874
BUT NOT BECAUSE
I WAS WRONG ABOUT HIM.

31:59.874 --> 32:02.007
IT WAS BECAUSE I WAS
WRONG ABOUT MYSELF.

32:02.007 --> 32:03.356
AND I KNOW
THAT'S NOT GOOD.

32:03.356 --> 32:05.314
I KNOW
THAT'S NOT FAIR TO HIM,

32:05.314 --> 32:08.796
BUT I WASN'T READY
TO BE SETTLING DOWN THAT WAY YET.

32:08.796 --> 32:11.277
AND I'M NOT READY NOW.

32:11.277 --> 32:12.931
WELL, BAILEY,
I'M SORRY, BUT--

32:12.931 --> 32:14.802
HEAR ME OUT,
CHARLIE, PLEASE.

32:17.370 --> 32:19.459
LAST COUPLE HOURS,

32:19.459 --> 32:21.591
I'VE BEEN
WALKING AROUND

32:21.591 --> 32:23.637
FEELING ANGRY

32:23.637 --> 32:25.944
AND FRUSTRATED
BECAUSE FINALLY,

32:25.944 --> 32:29.643
FINALLY I CAN SEE
WHAT I WANT,

32:29.643 --> 32:31.645
AND IT'S
OUT OF MY REACH,

32:31.645 --> 32:34.213
AND THE THING THAT'S
PREVENTING ME--

32:34.213 --> 32:35.649
IT'S WHAT YOU WANT.

32:36.606 --> 32:38.086
I JUST FINISHED SAYING--

32:38.086 --> 32:41.133
NOT--NOT JUST
WHAT YOU WANT FOR THE BUSINESS,

32:41.133 --> 32:44.353
CHARLIE, IT'S WHAT YOU
WANT FOR YOUR LIFE.

32:44.353 --> 32:46.094
I MEAN,
LOOK AT YOURSELF.

32:46.094 --> 32:48.488
YOU HAVE
EVERYTHING THAT YOU EVER WANTED.

32:48.488 --> 32:51.926
YOU HAVE KIRSTEN,
THE KIDS, THE JOB, US.

32:51.926 --> 32:53.449
BAILEY, HOLD ON--

32:53.449 --> 32:55.799
LISTEN, I MADE
A PROMISE, OK,

32:55.799 --> 32:59.673
TO OWEN, TO YOU,
AND TO EVERYBODY.

32:59.673 --> 33:02.328
BUT IF YOU
HOLD ME TO THAT,

33:02.328 --> 33:05.592
I HAVE TO KEEP
PUTTING OTHER PEOPLE FIRST...

33:06.810 --> 33:08.987
I'M GONNA START
TO RESENT YOU.

33:08.987 --> 33:12.164
THAT'S NOT GONNA
HAPPEN, BAILEY.

33:12.164 --> 33:13.382
CHARLIE...

33:13.382 --> 33:15.341
YOU'RE MY BROTHER,

33:15.341 --> 33:17.821
AND I DO NOT WANT
TO LOOK AT YOU THAT WAY,

33:17.821 --> 33:19.867
BUT I'M TELLING YOU,
I SIT HERE,

33:19.867 --> 33:22.043
AND I WATCH YOU LIVING OUT ALL
OF YOUR DREAMS--

33:22.043 --> 33:23.653
YOU'RE NOT GONNA
FEEL THAT WAY--

33:23.653 --> 33:25.438
NO,
YOU DON'T GET IT.

33:27.527 --> 33:31.705
I'M STARTING TO FEEL
THAT WAY NOW.

33:35.317 --> 33:37.276
I'M BEGGING YOU.

33:38.581 --> 33:40.714
I NEED YOU
TO HELP ME.

33:41.889 --> 33:43.543
PLEASE?

33:55.685 --> 33:57.644
WHERE'S VICTOR?

33:57.644 --> 34:01.039
UM, I ASKED HIM IF
I COULD PICK YOU UP TODAY.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.345
OH. WELL,
WHERE'S YOUR TRUCK?

34:03.345 --> 34:04.694
ACROSS THE STREET.

34:04.694 --> 34:06.174
BUT, UM,
BEFORE WE GO HOME,

34:06.174 --> 34:08.176
CAN WE TALK
FOR A MINUTE?

34:08.176 --> 34:10.265
OK.HERE YOU GO, BABE.

34:10.265 --> 34:12.050
[GURGLES AND LAUGHS]

34:12.050 --> 34:13.051
Owen: HEY, DIANA.

34:13.051 --> 34:15.009
WHAT DOES A COW SAY?

34:15.009 --> 34:16.228
MOOO.

34:16.228 --> 34:18.143
THAT'S GOOD.
THAT'S A REALLY GOOD MOO.

34:21.929 --> 34:24.062
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED
THE OTHER DAY?

34:24.062 --> 34:27.891
SHE WAS WAVING HER ARMS
AND SHOUTING,

34:27.891 --> 34:30.720
"WHEN WHEN! WHEN WHEN!
WHEN WHEN!"

34:30.720 --> 34:33.158
AND IT TOOK US A WHILE
TO FIGURE IT OUT,

34:33.158 --> 34:36.465
BUT THAT SECOND "WHEN"
MEANT OWEN.

34:36.465 --> 34:38.908
SHE WAS ASKING WHEN
SHE WAS GONNA SEE YOU AGAIN.

34:38.931 --> 34:41.612
- REALLY?
- YEAH. SHE'S IN LOVE WITH YOU, BUDDY.

34:42.732 --> 34:45.170
YEAH, WELL,
I LIKE HER, TOO.

34:47.389 --> 34:52.046
YOU KNOW, KIRSTEN AND I,
WE'RE HAVING A BABY,

34:52.046 --> 34:53.961
WHICH IS A LOT OF WORK,

34:53.961 --> 34:57.356
AND WE COULD SURE
USE SOME HELP WITH DIANA.

34:57.356 --> 34:59.314
DO YOU THINK
YOU MIGHT WANT TO DO THAT?

34:59.314 --> 35:01.316
HELP US OUT LIKE THAT?

35:01.316 --> 35:03.492
YOU MEAN, ME
COME LIVE WITH YOU

35:03.492 --> 35:06.147
BECAUSE BAILEY
IS LEAVING?

35:06.147 --> 35:09.411
WELL, YOU KNOW WHAT?

35:09.411 --> 35:10.499
HE MIGHT.

35:11.805 --> 35:15.330
SO, HOW WOULD THAT BE?

35:16.679 --> 35:18.986
I'D BE LIKE YOU.

35:18.986 --> 35:20.640
WHAT?

35:22.163 --> 35:24.687
HER BIG BROTHER.
I'D BE HER BIG BROTHER.

35:26.385 --> 35:28.300
WELL, YEAH.

35:28.300 --> 35:31.607
I COULD TAKE CARE OF HER
LIKE YOU DID WITH US.

35:37.570 --> 35:38.875
THEN...

35:40.877 --> 35:42.096
OK.

35:43.315 --> 35:45.055
GOOD.

35:49.321 --> 35:50.800
THAT'S GOOD.

35:58.678 --> 35:59.853
HEY.

36:01.246 --> 36:02.725
YOU GOT A MINUTE?

36:07.513 --> 36:09.167
YOU DON'T
HAVE TO EXPLAIN.

36:09.167 --> 36:11.691
I THINK I GET IT.

36:11.691 --> 36:13.780
NO, I HAVE TO SAY THIS.

36:15.521 --> 36:18.437
TODD, YOU'RE RIGHT.
I HAVE BEEN PLAYING GAMES.

36:19.699 --> 36:21.570
AND I HAVEN'T
BEEN HONEST.

36:30.013 --> 36:33.060
IT'S TRUE.

36:33.060 --> 36:35.889
SECOND I FOUND OUT
I GOT INTO JUILLIARD,

36:35.889 --> 36:37.543
I KNEW I SHOULD GO.

36:37.543 --> 36:40.459
SO I TRIED TO CONVINCE YOU
TO GET AN APARTMENT WITH ME.

36:40.459 --> 36:42.069
THAT WAY
THERE'D BE, LIKE,

36:42.069 --> 36:44.550
THIS EXTRA REASON
FOR ME TO STAY.

36:46.552 --> 36:49.772
BUT THAT LETTER
FROM JUILLIARD, IT JUST...

36:49.772 --> 36:51.687
SAT THERE ON MY DESK.

36:51.687 --> 36:55.517
SO FINALLY I BROKE DOWN,
AND I LET ROSS KNOW,

36:55.517 --> 36:58.085
BECAUSE I KNEW THAT
HE WOULD PUSH ME INTO GOING.

36:59.565 --> 37:01.436
YOU DIDN'T
WANT TO HURT ME.

37:03.873 --> 37:05.223
BUT YOU KNOW WHAT?

37:05.223 --> 37:06.702
I HURT YOU EVEN WORSE.

37:06.702 --> 37:08.878
NO.

37:08.878 --> 37:10.315
I HURT YOU.

37:12.404 --> 37:16.277
WHEN YOU SAID
YOU WANTED TO STAY AND I LET YOU,

37:16.277 --> 37:18.018
I--I PLAYED ALONG.

37:18.018 --> 37:20.716
I LET YOU FEEL GUILTY
ABOUT SOMETHING

37:20.716 --> 37:23.066
THAT YOU SHOULD
HAVE FELT GREAT ABOUT.

37:23.066 --> 37:24.459
TODD--

37:24.459 --> 37:25.808
NO, IT'S TRUE.

37:28.550 --> 37:31.249
I SHOULD HAVE
FELT GOOD FOR YOU.

37:32.598 --> 37:35.470
AND WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT THIS.

37:35.470 --> 37:37.951
BUT, I MEAN, IT'S NOT LIKE
WE'RE BREAKING UP.

37:37.951 --> 37:41.041
WE'RE STILL GONNA
SEE EACH OTHER.

37:41.041 --> 37:42.869
IT'S JUST
GONNA BE WORK.

37:42.869 --> 37:47.526
STILL 3 MONTHS
BEFORE YOU LEAVE...

37:47.526 --> 37:51.138
WHICH I PLAN TO SPEND EVERY
MINUTE OF WITH YOU.

38:03.585 --> 38:05.892
Justin: I KNOW THIS
IS GONNA SOUND INSANE,

38:05.892 --> 38:09.156
BUT WHEREVER WE LIVE,

38:09.156 --> 38:12.377
I THINK WE NEED A VIEW OF, LIKE,
A D.C. LANDMARK.

38:12.377 --> 38:13.900
IT COULD
BE ANY LANDMARK.

38:13.900 --> 38:15.510
UM, YOU KNOW,

38:15.510 --> 38:18.339
IT COULD BE A DISPLAY
OF GEORGE WASHINGTON'S TEETH.

38:18.339 --> 38:21.386
JUST AS LONG AS IT'S
SOMETHING, YOU KNOW?

38:21.386 --> 38:23.213
WHAT'S UP?
YOU ALL RIGHT?

38:24.780 --> 38:27.000
Julia: THIS IS IT.

38:27.000 --> 38:29.002
YOU KNOW THAT?
I'M LEAVING.

38:29.002 --> 38:31.309
LEAVING HOME.
I'LL PROBABLY NEVER COME BACK.

38:31.309 --> 38:32.875
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?
- YOU'LL COME BACK.

38:32.875 --> 38:34.181
YOU'LL, YOU KNOW--

38:34.181 --> 38:36.531
TO VISIT,BUT NOT TO LIVE.

38:36.531 --> 38:39.621
TO BORROW A COUCH IN THE HOUSE
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

38:39.621 --> 38:41.754
I'LL PROBABLY NEVER
EVEN UNPACK MY SUITCASE.

38:41.754 --> 38:43.669
LOOK, JULIA.
DON'T DO THIS.

38:43.669 --> 38:46.672
DON'T START MAKING
YOURSELF FEEL GUILTY--

38:46.672 --> 38:48.587
NO, NO.
IT'S OK. I'M NOT.

38:48.587 --> 38:51.198
I JUST, I MEAN,
THEY HAVE EACH OTHER.

38:51.198 --> 38:54.854
I GUESS I'M JUST SAYING
I WON'T HAVE THEM.

38:56.421 --> 38:59.249
IT'S GONNA BE WEIRD.
I MEAN, WE'LL WRITE,

38:59.249 --> 39:02.862
WE'LL TALK, BUT SOON, I MEAN,
AFTER A COUPLE OF YEARS,

39:02.862 --> 39:05.865
I'M NOT GONNA
KNOW THEM SO WELL.

39:05.865 --> 39:08.563
YOU KNOW? I WON'T KNOW
WHAT THEIR DAYS ARE LIKE

39:08.563 --> 39:10.783
OR WHAT THEY WATCH ON TV

39:10.783 --> 39:13.655
OR WHAT THEIR HAIR
LOOKS LIKE IN THE MORNING.

39:20.662 --> 39:23.448
I GUESS THEY'LL
JUST BE WHAT I REMEMBER.

39:32.674 --> 39:33.675
HEY.

39:33.675 --> 39:34.763
HEY.

39:35.851 --> 39:37.766
GOTTA FINISH
THAT P &amp; L

39:37.766 --> 39:39.246
FOR THE SUBCONTRACTING
BUSINESS

39:39.246 --> 39:41.161
IF YOU WANT
TO SPIN IT OFF BEFORE TAX TIME.

39:41.161 --> 39:43.424
FORGET IT. YOU DON'T
HAVE TIME FOR THAT.

39:43.424 --> 39:46.296
YOU GOTTA GET DOWN TO YOUR
REGISTRAR'S OFFICE.

39:46.997 --> 39:48.109
WHAT?

39:48.119 --> 39:50.431
PENN NEEDS
TO GET YOUR TRANSCRIPT

39:50.431 --> 39:52.607
IF YOU'RE GONNA GET
INTO THEIR SUMMER SCHOOL PROGRAM.

39:53.782 --> 39:55.393
JASON KIMBALL CALLED,

39:55.393 --> 39:58.439
AND HE WAS
A LITTLE IMPATIENT.

39:58.439 --> 40:00.354
HE SAID THAT
YOU COULDN'T COMMIT

40:00.354 --> 40:02.356
ABOUT WHETHER
TO GO OR NOT.

40:02.356 --> 40:05.751
SO I KINDA
COMMITTED FOR YOU.

40:05.751 --> 40:07.840
CHARLIE,
I DON'T UNDERSTAND.

40:07.840 --> 40:10.538
SORRY. I'M SORRY. HI.

40:10.538 --> 40:12.235
WE'VE GOT
THE TAXI WAITING,

40:12.235 --> 40:14.803
BUT LUKE WANTS
TO READ THE, UM,

40:14.803 --> 40:16.979
BROCHURES FOR HIM
ON THE PLANE.

40:16.979 --> 40:18.198
Charlie: IT'S
ALL RIGHT THERE.

40:18.198 --> 40:19.591
OK, THANK YOU.

40:19.591 --> 40:21.636
HOW AM I EVER GONNA
THANK YOU ENOUGH?

40:21.636 --> 40:24.813
OH, DAPH,
YOU ALREADY HAVE.

40:24.813 --> 40:26.554
I LOVE YOU SO MUCH.

40:26.554 --> 40:28.251
BUT I HAVE TO GO
'CAUSE I'M LATE.

40:28.251 --> 40:30.079
OK, BYE.OK, BYE.

40:31.124 --> 40:32.125
BYE!

40:32.125 --> 40:33.126
BYE.

40:33.126 --> 40:34.170
HEY,

40:34.170 --> 40:36.303
HAVE A CHEESE STEAK
FOR ME.

40:37.913 --> 40:39.349
WHAT WAS THAT ABOUT?

40:40.438 --> 40:42.135
WELL, UH...

40:42.135 --> 40:44.180
LUKE DOESN'T HAVE YOUR
BUSINESS EXPERIENCE,

40:44.180 --> 40:47.053
BUT HE'S SPENT LOTS
OF TIME MANAGING PEOPLE.

40:47.053 --> 40:49.925
IT'S NOT PERFECT,
BUT IT BUYS US ALL SOME TIME.

40:49.925 --> 40:52.580
PLUS IT LETS THEM COME
BACK TO SAN FRANCISCO.

40:52.580 --> 40:54.147
DIANA WILL HAVE
HER MOTHER AROUND.

40:54.147 --> 40:56.062
IT BUYS YOU TIME?
WHAT BUYS YOU TIME?

40:56.062 --> 40:58.020
LUKE'S GONNA
TAKE YOUR PLACE HERE.

40:58.020 --> 40:59.979
WHEN DID THAT HAPPEN?

40:59.979 --> 41:01.676
UH, THIS MORNING.

41:03.504 --> 41:06.202
HE WAS ABOUT
TO TAKE OFF WITHOUT HER,

41:06.202 --> 41:10.032
AND THE IDEA
JUST HIT ME.

41:11.730 --> 41:12.774
CHARLIE--

41:12.774 --> 41:14.950
I WANT YOU
TO DO THIS, BAILEY.

41:14.950 --> 41:19.085
I WANT YOU TO GO GET
THAT BUSINESS DEGREE,

41:19.085 --> 41:20.869
AND I'LL TAKE OWEN.

41:20.869 --> 41:23.568
I'LL PROBABLY MOVE
BACK INTO THE HOUSE WITH KIRSTEN,

41:23.568 --> 41:26.179
BUT EITHER WAY,
HE'LL LIVE WITH US.

41:26.179 --> 41:29.051
AND, UM, MAYBE ALL OF US
BEING TOGETHER,

41:29.051 --> 41:30.879
JULIA, CLAUDIA,
OWEN, AND ME,

41:30.879 --> 41:34.448
IT'LL SOFTEN THE BLOW
OF YOU LEAVING.

41:37.190 --> 41:40.019
BUT...WHAT HAPPENED?

41:40.019 --> 41:42.891
I JUST THOUGHT
ABOUT WHAT YOU SAID

41:42.891 --> 41:45.067
ABOUT ME
HOLDING YOU TO THIS.

41:46.939 --> 41:48.418
YOU KNOW, IT'S--

41:48.418 --> 41:49.898
IT'S WRONG.

41:49.898 --> 41:53.032
MAYBE IT'S THAT
YOU VOLUNTEERED, THAT YOU DID

41:53.032 --> 41:56.035
WHAT YOU DID FOR ALL THOSE YEARS
WITHOUT BEING ASKED.

41:56.035 --> 41:58.907
MAYBE THAT MADE US FEEL
LIKE YOU PROMISED US SOMETHING...

42:00.256 --> 42:02.215
THAT YOU WERE GONNA
BE AROUND FOREVER.

42:06.132 --> 42:07.525
SO...

42:08.613 --> 42:09.614
GO.

42:10.789 --> 42:13.443
YOU DESERVE THIS.
COMPLETELY.

42:17.535 --> 42:19.406
[SIGHS] CHARLIE--

42:19.406 --> 42:22.452
YOU KNOW WHAT?
YOU GOTTA GET GOING.

42:22.452 --> 42:24.498
GO GET
THAT TRANSCRIPT IN.

42:24.498 --> 42:25.586
GO.
