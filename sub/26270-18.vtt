sound familiar?
-Sergeant Grant.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.631
Do you remember working an arsoncase about three years back?

19:57.674 --> 19:59.502
It was a restaurant.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.069
Guillermo's.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.159
I, um-- Agent Boyd, this is
Captain Nash of LAFD.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.117
We worked on that case together.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.859
It's the only time I've had to
testify since I moved to L.A.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.253
The owner was Victor Costas.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
He got six years.
Should still be in prison.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.866
Well, released early,
on account of he's dead.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.434
About three months ago.
Cancer.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.306
He had a wife and a kid.
A teenager.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.873
And the son, his son,
was really angry

20:22.917 --> 20:24.310
when his father got arrested.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.615
Father's dead.

20:25.659 --> 20:28.531
I wonder how angry he is now.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.273
I can't help you.
I don't know where Freddie is.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.406
I haven't seen him since
Victor's funeral.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.059
Yeah, I heard about
your husband's death.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.235
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.194
Are you?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.283
You put him in there.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Now you want to
put Freddie away, too.

20:43.372 --> 20:46.419
He's hurt a lot of people,
Mrs. Costas.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.421
Killed a judge.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.292
I don't know anything
about that.

Maybe. At first.

20:52.990 --> 20:57.517
Mrs. Filson defends criminals.
Probably had a lot of enemies.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.735
Then the insurance adjuster,

20:58.779 --> 21:00.694
who's on life support,
by the way,

21:00.737 --> 21:01.956
you told yourself what?

21:01.999 --> 21:05.307
It was a coincidence?
Couldn't be true?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.571
We lost everything.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.660
Insurance wouldn't pay.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.793
All our creditors sued us.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.536
We sold everything we had
to pay for that lawyer,

21:16.579 --> 21:17.667
and what did we get?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.495
A death sentence.

21:19.539 --> 21:22.498
Prison brokemy husband,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.544
and then it killed him.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
So Freddie was angry.

21:29.592 --> 21:31.333

his father was arrested.

21:43.606 --> 21:44.955

Captain Nash for last.

30:44.364 --> 30:47.019
Just that you made it through.

30:47.062 --> 30:51.284
And you're now the proud owner
of one titanium rod and four

30:51.327 --> 30:54.330
beautifully cobalt-chromed
screws. [chuckles]

30:55.723 --> 30:57.507
You were hoping for
something more?

30:57.551 --> 31:01.033
Before they wheeled me in,
he, uh...

31:01.076 --> 31:04.253
he said he didn't know
how it was gonna go.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.038
You'll walk again.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.779
Yeah. He-he said...

31:08.823 --> 31:11.913
he said he was pretty confidentabout that.

31:11.957 --> 31:17.179
He, uh, he just-- he didn't knowif I would ever...

31:17.223 --> 31:19.051
work again.

31:21.183 --> 31:24.143
Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you

31:24.186 --> 31:27.146
and tell you that
it's gonna be all right.

31:27.189 --> 31:31.977
But I don't think you need to beborrowing trouble, not yet.

31:32.020 --> 31:35.328

and be glad that you're alive.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.288
Ali seems nice.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.813
-You met Ali?
-Mm.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.337
So we're into brunettes now.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.557
She was actually blonde
when I met her.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.168

the waterfront.

-Hey.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.438
Hey...

32:01.223 --> 32:02.442
Hey.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.188
You were in surgery for a while.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.407
Too long.

32:11.451 --> 32:14.323
Thank you for being here.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.065
I would like it noted that
he didn't thank either of us.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.894

we're still in the room.
-Right?

It's Caltech, part-time.

more time with Denny...

32:53.667 --> 32:57.062

who might come along.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.240
-You see what you did there?
-[laughs]

33:01.283 --> 33:05.592
Just dropped it, quiet-like.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.942

talked about it.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.481

We weren't sure
if we were making

33:29.311 --> 33:32.271
the right decision
that time either.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.621
But there has never been a day

33:34.664 --> 33:37.711

33:37.754 --> 33:39.539

33:39.582 --> 33:41.845
You and that man

33:41.889 --> 33:44.109

that get me home every day.

33:44.152 --> 33:49.027

33:58.688 --> 34:01.996
Now that is a hell of a thing.

-A loaner?

34:04.172 --> 34:05.652
Chim, for real?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.175
I'm kidding. We own it.

are not allowed to flip,

to fire a guy

Not to mention
the fiery tweet-storm

Captain Han just a little.

Easy, okay?

I don't want you to fall
and break the other one.

of the hospital.

-Yeah?
-I miss my own bed...

for the next three months.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.921
Guess I am sleeping down here.

a perpetual roommate.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.752
Even in your own place.

Lesson learned:
Never sign a lease

if you intend on being crushed
by municipal equipment.

by municipal equipment?

Huh. Now, why didn't
I think of that?

35:20.466 --> 35:22.120
I don't know. Mm.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.342
So...

35:27.386 --> 35:29.562
have you, uh, have you thought
about what's next?

35:29.605 --> 35:32.217
Once you take this thing off.
[laughs]

35:32.260 --> 35:36.046
Why? Did-did the doctor say
something to you?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.526
No.

35:37.570 --> 35:41.617
Um, I don't-- I don't know,
you know.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.750
I guess a lot of
physical therapy and then...

35:43.793 --> 35:46.883
You'll probably want to just
get right back out there.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.670
Yeah, of-of course, I mean...

35:50.713 --> 35:52.193

-But you could have.

of work

when I met you, you know,
ten stories up

36:17.131 --> 36:18.393
of a collapsing high rise.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.787
-Exactly.
-That was one day...

one day of my life, Evan.

never ask you to do that.

were ever gonna be the same

I was wrong.

another surgery.

Uh, doctor wasn't happywith what he saw on the X-rays,

38:40.666 --> 38:41.928
so he wants to go back in

38:41.971 --> 38:44.713
and replace the rod
and do some bone grafts.

a delayed union or nonunion?

slower than expected,

38:55.811 --> 38:58.118
sooner I can go back to work.

to wait.

grocery shopping, the usual.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.580
What if we get married instead?

42:19.624 --> 42:21.234
-Whoa.
-Go to the courthouse,

42:21.277 --> 42:23.584
get our license, say our vows,
just do it.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.934

So when the ground shifts
beneath our feet

42:55.268 --> 42:58.663
and the storms rage around us,

42:58.706 --> 43:03.668
it's all these people
that provide relief.

43:03.711 --> 43:08.847
And offer shelter.

43:08.890 --> 43:13.025
This is how we save ourselves,

43:13.068 --> 43:16.550
by saving each other.

43:18.465 --> 43:23.035
Because nobody, not anybody,

43:23.078 --> 43:25.690
has ever been saved alone.
