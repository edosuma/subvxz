00:01.305 --> 00:03.264
ANNOUNCER: 9-1-1,
what's your emergency?

00:03.307 --> 00:05.309
This right here
is your stop.

00:05.353 --> 00:08.965
Catch all-new episodes
Mondays, and check out
our other Fox programs--

00:09.009 --> 00:12.316
Empire, Star, andThe Resident.

00:12.360 --> 00:14.623
Let's use today
as an opportunity to
celebrate what's to come.

00:14.666 --> 00:15.972
ANNOUNCER:
Only on Fox.

00:18.322 --> 00:19.062
Hello, everybody.
Thanks for spending

00:19.106 --> 00:20.759
your mornings with us today.

00:20.803 --> 00:23.066
Angelenos waking up
a little bit on edge today

00:23.110 --> 00:25.286
after a second package bomb
has exploded

00:25.329 --> 00:27.418
in the Southland
in as many days.

00:27.462 --> 00:29.159
Now, the first victim,

00:29.203 --> 00:31.118
Miranda Filson, she's
a criminal defense attorney

00:31.161 --> 00:34.295
from South Pasadena,and somehow survived the blast.

00:34.338 --> 00:37.298
The second victim,
a retired insurance adjustor,

00:37.341 --> 00:39.474
is clinging to life
at this very hour.

00:39.517 --> 00:42.694
Now, authorities are urging
the public: stay vigilant.

00:42.738 --> 00:44.957
If you see something,
say something.

00:45.001 --> 00:47.569
If the truck's parked ina driveway with its hazards on,

00:47.612 --> 00:49.875
it's probably
just making a delivery.

00:49.919 --> 00:51.529
No, sir. Having
a foreign-sounding last name

00:51.573 --> 00:54.097
is not reason enough
for me to send the police out

00:54.141 --> 00:55.664
to investigate your neighbors.

00:55.707 --> 00:58.014
-[barking over phone]
-[sighs]: Uh, uh, I'm sorry.

00:58.058 --> 01:00.190
Ma'am, I'm having
some trouble hearing you.

01:00.234 --> 01:01.887
Are you being attacked by a dog?

01:01.931 --> 01:03.585
WOMAN:
No! That's my dog!

01:03.628 --> 01:05.935
We've got the bomber
pinned down!

01:05.978 --> 01:07.893
-Send the cops!
-MAN: Ah! Stop it!

01:07.937 --> 01:10.113
-WOMAN: Good boy, Titus.
-God, help me. She's crazy.

01:10.157 --> 01:12.159
You say you have the bomber
pinned down?

01:12.202 --> 01:14.204
WOMAN:  I caught him putting a package

01:14.248 --> 01:16.380
-in my mailbox.
-MAN: I'm the mailman!

01:16.424 --> 01:18.513
-Ma'am, he says
he's the mailman.
-He's not my mailman.

01:18.556 --> 01:21.342
-My mailman's Larry.
-Stop! Stop it!

01:21.385 --> 01:23.996
Larry's out for two weeks
with foot surgery!

01:24.040 --> 01:25.911
-WOMAN: I think
he did something to Larry.
-Okay, I'm dispatching

01:25.955 --> 01:27.391
-a unit to your location.
-[man shouting]

01:27.435 --> 01:29.176
And, ma'am, I suggest you
put Titus back in the house

01:29.219 --> 01:31.395
-before the officers arrive.  -MAN: You got to help me here.

01:31.439 --> 01:32.831
â™ª

01:32.875 --> 01:34.529
911. What's your emergency?

01:34.572 --> 01:36.400
WOMAN: Oh, my God, there's a backpack!

01:36.444 --> 01:38.707
-There's a backpack  outside Brookside Elementary!
-Ma'am?

01:38.750 --> 01:40.622
-Send the cops! Quick! Please!
-Ma'am, slow down.

01:40.665 --> 01:42.798
Tell me again,
where was the backpack found?

01:42.841 --> 01:44.408
[children screaming, shouting]

01:44.452 --> 01:46.758
MAN:
Keep moving.

01:46.802 --> 01:48.586
[excited chatter]

01:48.630 --> 01:50.501
[alarm ringing]

01:50.545 --> 01:52.155
[sirens wailing, horn blowing]

01:52.199 --> 01:55.811
[chatter continues]

01:58.248 --> 02:00.163
BUCK:
All right, everyone, as close

02:00.207 --> 02:02.034
and as tight to the truck
as you can be.

02:02.078 --> 02:04.167
All right, stay tucked in,
stay tucked in.

02:04.211 --> 02:05.603
You guys are doing great.
Thank you.

02:05.647 --> 02:09.390
Teacher spotted it out there
after recess.

02:09.433 --> 02:10.304
Nobody claimed it.

02:10.347 --> 02:12.044
Yeah, but it's not a package.

02:12.088 --> 02:14.003
I thought this guy sent
his bombs through the mail.

02:14.046 --> 02:17.354
-Maybe he changed his M.O.
-Or inspired some other crazy.

02:22.142 --> 02:24.796
MAN [over radio]:
Air 32 on tac 1.
Moving into position.

02:24.840 --> 02:28.191
[filtered breathing]

02:28.235 --> 02:30.454
We have visual.

02:30.498 --> 02:32.717
Repeat, we have visual.

02:37.418 --> 02:40.290
-JIM: Carlos, what do we got?
-Unclear.

02:40.334 --> 02:43.989
Some metallic component
is interfering with the image.

02:44.033 --> 02:45.382
Shall we travel it?

02:47.428 --> 02:49.212
I repeat, shall we travel it?

02:50.257 --> 02:51.910
Let's not take any chances.

02:51.954 --> 02:54.086
Proceed with
controlled detonation.

02:54.130 --> 02:55.392
Copy that.

03:08.144 --> 03:10.015
JIM:
All units, be advised!

03:10.059 --> 03:11.016
Fire in the hole.

03:11.060 --> 03:12.322
Stay tucked in.

03:12.366 --> 03:15.369
-JIM: On my mark!
-Down, down, down.

03:15.412 --> 03:16.500
Three...

03:16.544 --> 03:18.067
two...

03:18.110 --> 03:19.155
one.

03:26.728 --> 03:28.512
Whoa, whoa, whoa.Stay back, stay back, stay back.

03:28.556 --> 03:31.428
â™ª

03:37.695 --> 03:41.133
Substance appears to be
some kind of... grayish paste.

03:41.177 --> 03:43.527
GIRL:
It's tuna fish.

03:46.443 --> 03:49.533
Emily. Was that your lunch?

03:49.577 --> 03:52.319
-Yes.
-Why didn't you say something?

03:52.362 --> 03:54.190
I don't like tuna fish.

03:54.234 --> 03:55.974
Am I under arrest?

03:58.368 --> 04:00.283
These false alarms
are almost more nerve-wracking

04:00.327 --> 04:02.416
-than the real thing.
-Don't even think that.

04:02.459 --> 04:04.331
Maybe the whole thing
is a false alarm.

04:04.374 --> 04:07.334
-Maybe it's over.
-Maybe.

04:07.377 --> 04:08.639
MAN [over radio]:
All-clear given.

04:08.683 --> 04:10.685
All-clear given.
There is no bomb.

04:10.728 --> 04:12.295
All students and staff

04:12.339 --> 04:13.514
are permitted
to enter the campus.

04:13.557 --> 04:16.168
Engine 118 is on the scene.

04:16.212 --> 04:18.519
OFFICER:
Central. 10-24.
We are en route now.

04:24.351 --> 04:26.309
BOBBY:
Okay, this is
our final contestant.

04:26.353 --> 04:27.702
ATHENA:
Okay.

04:27.745 --> 04:29.747
-Mmm! Mmm, mmm!
-You're picking a cake

04:29.791 --> 04:31.967
but haven't even decided
on the venue?

04:32.010 --> 04:33.577
The cake is how
we're picking the venue.

04:33.621 --> 04:35.492
Yeah, it seems silly
to run all over town

04:35.536 --> 04:37.799
looking at yachts and ballroomsand country clubs,

04:37.842 --> 04:39.801
so we settled
on three restaurants

04:39.844 --> 04:42.456
-that can all do a wedding.
-Bought a cake from each.

04:42.499 --> 04:45.328
-Best cake wins.
-Have you guys finalized
your guest list yet?

04:45.372 --> 04:46.721
BOBBY:
That all depends.

04:46.764 --> 04:49.114
Your mother won't allow me
to put Chief Alonzo

04:49.158 --> 04:51.465
on the guest list
till my suspension is lifted.

04:51.508 --> 04:54.250
Which needs to happen
by the end of the week.

04:54.294 --> 04:56.905
I still don't understand why youguys are doing a stupid wedding.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.907
Baby, I thought you were good

04:58.950 --> 05:00.909
with me and Bobby
getting married.

05:00.952 --> 05:03.477
Because if you're not,
if you need more time...

05:03.520 --> 05:04.826
No. It's fine.

05:04.869 --> 05:06.523
You guys can get married.

05:06.567 --> 05:08.699
It's just...

05:08.743 --> 05:12.747
I don't want to wear a tux,
or dance with May.

05:12.790 --> 05:15.619
Well, who said
you had to wear a tux?

05:15.663 --> 05:17.795
Mom, it's a wedding.Of course he has to wear a tux.

05:17.839 --> 05:19.754
HARRY:
Tuxedos are stupid.

05:19.797 --> 05:22.365
And plus, I'm way too old
to be a ring bearer.

05:22.409 --> 05:24.193
ATHENA:
Oh, aw,

05:24.236 --> 05:27.065
but you're exactly the right ageto walk me down the aisle.

05:27.109 --> 05:29.372
Hmm? This wedding

05:29.416 --> 05:30.982
isn't just about me and Bobby.

05:31.026 --> 05:34.421
It's about us--
the three of us--

05:34.464 --> 05:37.554
choosing to make Bobby
a part of our family.

05:37.598 --> 05:41.515
Now, we all walk down that aisletogether or not at all.

05:41.558 --> 05:42.603
Okay.

05:42.646 --> 05:44.126
Together.

05:45.432 --> 05:47.216
Maybe just without the tux?

05:47.259 --> 05:49.087
[laughing]

05:52.830 --> 05:54.528
[indistinct chatter]

05:54.571 --> 05:56.617
[Helena sighs]

05:56.660 --> 05:58.880
-He is growing up way too fast.
-[chuckles]

05:58.923 --> 06:02.492
Mm, he was so brave yesterday
at the funeral.

06:03.493 --> 06:04.755
Bravest kid I know.

06:04.799 --> 06:06.975
Yep, yep. Just like his father.

06:07.018 --> 06:10.021
[chuckles]
His mom was pretty brave, too.

06:10.065 --> 06:12.459
How? By running out on him?

06:12.502 --> 06:14.896
Ramon.

06:14.939 --> 06:16.463
Papi,we're not doing this.

06:16.506 --> 06:18.203
[sighs]

06:18.247 --> 06:20.815
I apologize.

06:20.858 --> 06:23.774
Look, honey, um...

06:23.818 --> 06:25.994
we know Shannon
loved Christopher.

06:26.037 --> 06:27.648
Of course, Mom.

06:27.691 --> 06:30.259
Okay. But she's gone...

06:30.302 --> 06:33.131
and you are
a single father, again,

06:33.175 --> 06:35.482
okay, and the hours
you work, Eddie...

06:37.266 --> 06:38.789
Come home.

06:38.833 --> 06:41.575
-To El Paso?
-Texas has fires, too.

06:41.618 --> 06:43.577
You could join
a department there.

06:43.620 --> 06:45.492
[chuckles]:
Dad.

06:45.535 --> 06:47.668
It's not that simple.

06:47.711 --> 06:50.061
I'm still
a probationary firefighter.

06:50.105 --> 06:51.846
I'm so close
to earning my shield.

06:51.889 --> 06:55.676
You want me to just throw away
the last year of my life?

06:57.547 --> 06:59.157
Right.

06:59.201 --> 07:02.247
Is that why you all
flew in here, huh?

07:02.291 --> 07:03.597
Not for the funeral,

07:03.640 --> 07:05.599
but to bring us back,
was that the plan?

07:05.642 --> 07:07.514
Yeah, and we could help you,
and Christopher

07:07.557 --> 07:09.646
would be close to family,and you could have a life there.

07:09.690 --> 07:11.866
We have a life here, and family.

07:11.909 --> 07:13.345
Thank you, Eddie.

07:13.389 --> 07:15.565
We are sitting right here.

07:18.786 --> 07:20.483
EDDIE:
I won't uproot him again.

07:20.527 --> 07:22.267
RAMON:
Christopher hasn't
been here long enough

07:22.311 --> 07:23.704
to put down roots--
he spent

07:23.747 --> 07:26.141
the first six years
of his life in El Paso,

07:26.184 --> 07:28.012
with us.

07:29.797 --> 07:32.930
Being with me is
what's best for Christopher.

07:35.150 --> 07:37.761
I chose this life for a reason.

07:37.805 --> 07:39.459
You can choose another one.

07:46.727 --> 07:49.338
â™ª I couldn't stop movin'
when it first took holdâ™ª

07:51.775 --> 07:55.649
â™ª It was a warm spring night
at the old town hallâ™ª

07:55.692 --> 07:57.651
â™ª There was a group
called The Jokers...â™ª

07:57.694 --> 07:58.869
How's the line look?

07:58.913 --> 08:01.655
35, 50 people tops.

08:01.698 --> 08:03.657
And most of them standing

08:03.700 --> 08:05.659
against the gate
looking at their phone.

08:05.702 --> 08:08.444
People are probably staying home'cause of the bomber.

08:08.488 --> 08:10.751
Time was, there'd be 30, 40,

08:10.794 --> 08:12.666
hell, even 50,000 fans
out there.

08:12.709 --> 08:15.364
I mean, we played stadiums
halfway around the globe.

08:15.407 --> 08:17.540
Yeah? Well, folks got
the Internet now.

08:17.584 --> 08:19.934
If they want to see dumb peopledoing stupid things,

08:19.977 --> 08:22.153
they can just get it
for free online.

08:22.197 --> 08:23.981
Hey, hey,
who you calling stupid?

08:24.025 --> 08:26.549
You're dumb.
The car is stupid.

08:28.812 --> 08:30.422
This whole production, actually.

08:30.466 --> 08:32.207
[ignition sputtering]

08:35.297 --> 08:37.125
Will you quit your complaining?

08:37.168 --> 08:39.649
You wanted me to retire. Fine.

08:39.693 --> 08:41.259
But first...

08:41.303 --> 08:43.566
I'm gonna give 'em a show.

08:43.610 --> 08:48.571
Right now, I'm looking ata useless heap of rusted junk...

08:48.615 --> 08:49.964
and then there's the car.

08:50.007 --> 08:51.618
Har-har.

08:51.661 --> 08:54.577
Me and this car got a lot
of miles left on us.

08:54.621 --> 08:56.623
Baby.

08:56.666 --> 08:57.972
This is dangerous.

08:58.015 --> 08:59.582
You might be my fourth wife,

08:59.626 --> 09:02.019
but Janis here,
she's my first love.

09:02.063 --> 09:05.283
I think you just want to go outin a big old blaze of glory.

09:05.327 --> 09:08.373
Yeah? Well, if it means
I'd get one single minute

09:08.417 --> 09:09.636
-of peace and quiet...
-Hey!

09:09.679 --> 09:11.202
...so be it.

09:11.246 --> 09:12.987
[Roy chuckles, clears throat]

09:13.030 --> 09:15.032
Try her now.

09:16.033 --> 09:17.600
Try her now!

09:17.644 --> 09:18.688
Okay!

09:19.646 --> 09:22.170
[engine starts]

09:22.213 --> 09:24.825
-[screaming]
-Roy!

09:24.868 --> 09:26.653
-[continues screaming]
-Roy!

09:35.444 --> 09:36.837
[sirens wailing]

09:36.880 --> 09:38.882
ROY:
Be careful what you do, okay?

09:38.926 --> 09:40.536
-I know, I know.
-Do you know what y...

09:40.580 --> 09:42.059
-Just be quiet. Be quiet!
-Where you going? Where you...

09:45.367 --> 09:47.630
-Ma'am, what happened?
-He got himself all caught up

09:47.674 --> 09:50.111
in the engine-- it just,it just sucked him straight in.

09:50.154 --> 09:52.635
"She," damn it!
The car is a she!

09:52.679 --> 09:54.463
Let this be a lesson
to you, Roy.

09:54.506 --> 09:56.639
You mistreat a woman,
they mistreat you right back.

09:56.683 --> 09:59.642
You know, I-I've been trying to,like, cut him loose,

09:59.686 --> 10:01.905
but I can't quite get in there.

10:01.949 --> 10:04.734
Let's get down there
and see what we can do.

10:06.040 --> 10:07.432
HEN:
Oh.

10:07.476 --> 10:09.652
Sir, I need you to keep
very, very still.

10:09.696 --> 10:12.002
Any chance you can get me loosewithout cutting the hair?

10:12.046 --> 10:14.526
-It's kind of
my trademark, you know?
-MAUDE: Forget the hair!

10:14.570 --> 10:16.790
-You've been scalped.
-What?!

10:16.833 --> 10:18.356
MAUDE:
That's what I've been
trying to tell you.

10:18.400 --> 10:20.228
You know, this isn't even
the worst he's been hurt.

10:20.271 --> 10:22.491
-Okay, ma'am, I need you to giveus some room to work, okay?
-What? Why?

10:22.534 --> 10:24.232
Yeah, I can see why
she couldn't get in there.

10:24.275 --> 10:26.060
His hair is too tightly wound
into the belt.

10:26.103 --> 10:28.062
We can't cut him free
without pulling at the wound

10:28.105 --> 10:29.106
and making it worse.

10:29.150 --> 10:30.891
We'll have
to come at it sideways.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.762
Sideways?
What do you mean, sideways?

10:32.806 --> 10:33.807
EDDIE:
We're gonna have
to cut the engine belt

10:33.850 --> 10:34.808
and remove the alternator,

10:34.851 --> 10:36.723
probably the crankshaft pulley,

10:36.766 --> 10:38.159
whatever's in the way
to get you free.

10:38.202 --> 10:40.335
Like hell you are!

10:41.771 --> 10:43.599
[power tool whirring]

10:43.643 --> 10:45.514
We need to locate that piston.

10:47.603 --> 10:49.779
ROY:
That hood's a one-of-a-kind.

10:49.823 --> 10:50.867
Just be careful. Please.

10:50.911 --> 10:53.478
We'll need a socket wrench
for that crankshaft.

10:53.522 --> 10:55.393
ROY:
Oh, man.

10:56.438 --> 10:57.918
Ooh.

10:57.961 --> 10:59.354
ROY:
Oh, don't put that over there.

10:59.397 --> 11:02.096
-Oh, God.
-One, two...

11:02.139 --> 11:03.532
-[Roy screams]
-CHIMNEY: Just hold on.

11:04.925 --> 11:06.883
-Almost there.
-[Roy groans]

11:09.973 --> 11:11.845
-You're killing her!
-Try to relax, sir.

11:11.888 --> 11:13.716
ROY:
How can I relax?

11:13.760 --> 11:14.761
You're killing my car, man.

11:16.588 --> 11:18.286
ROY:
Oh, man.

11:18.329 --> 11:19.766
Thought you wanted
a blaze of glory.

11:19.809 --> 11:22.856
Setting you on fire, now that
would be a glorious blaze.

11:22.899 --> 11:24.118
[screaming]

11:24.161 --> 11:26.381
Please, sir, do not move!
Do not move!

11:26.424 --> 11:28.426
Damn it.
He pulled the occipital vein.

11:28.470 --> 11:30.167
-Cap, he's gonna bleed out.
-All right,
let's step it up, guys.

11:30.211 --> 11:32.517
-Hen, what's going on down here?-I'm almost there.

11:32.561 --> 11:34.128
MAUDE:
Oh, God, don't let him die,
you guys.

11:34.171 --> 11:35.738
I love the bastard.

11:35.782 --> 11:37.131
-HEN: Almost there.
-Maude, I swear to you,

11:37.174 --> 11:38.436
honey,
if I get out of this alive,

11:38.480 --> 11:40.961
I'll never do
a reckless thing ever.

11:41.004 --> 11:43.006
I'm done with that life.
[crying]

11:43.050 --> 11:44.355
MAUDE:
It's okay, baby,
we're gonna get you out.

11:44.399 --> 11:45.400
HEN:
It's coming, coming, coming.

11:46.793 --> 11:47.794
MAUDE:
I'm here, baby.

11:48.925 --> 11:50.144
CHIMNEY:
Got it.

11:50.187 --> 11:52.146
Let's raise him up,
nice and easy.

11:52.189 --> 11:53.451
MAUDE:
Oh!

11:53.495 --> 11:55.410
[Roy groans]

11:57.586 --> 11:59.544
MAUDE:
You dumb fool.

11:59.588 --> 12:02.417
All this just to impress
a couple dozen people?

12:02.460 --> 12:04.027
Not them.

12:04.071 --> 12:05.550
You.

12:05.594 --> 12:08.640
All you got to do
to impress me is live.

12:08.684 --> 12:11.165
-He'll live.
-I will?

12:11.208 --> 12:12.993
-[Maude exhales]
-You hear that, Maude?

12:13.036 --> 12:14.646
I'm gonna live.

12:16.866 --> 12:19.173
Keep the parts safe, honey.

12:19.216 --> 12:20.652
Call the promoter.

12:20.696 --> 12:22.002
A couple of stitches,

12:22.045 --> 12:25.005
a decent toupee,
we can do this comeback tour

12:25.048 --> 12:26.180
next week.

12:26.223 --> 12:28.835
I'm back, baby! [laughs]

12:28.878 --> 12:30.401
Roy, you son of a...

12:37.017 --> 12:39.236
It has a full kitchen
with a quartz backsplash,

12:39.280 --> 12:42.196
spacious master bathroom,
elevated sleeping area.

12:42.239 --> 12:44.720
And the view. [laughs]

12:44.764 --> 12:46.853
You cannot put a price on that.

12:46.896 --> 12:49.290
Yeah, but, mm, you did.

12:49.333 --> 12:51.683
[laughs] There's wiggle room.

12:51.727 --> 12:54.643
Well, we are all about
the wiggle room, right?

12:54.686 --> 12:56.863
[chuckles] Yeah.

12:56.906 --> 12:59.039
I like it.

12:59.082 --> 13:00.867
Open floor plan.

13:00.910 --> 13:02.216
Touch of modern.

13:02.259 --> 13:03.957
A little raw.

13:04.000 --> 13:06.220
I see the potential.

13:06.263 --> 13:08.309
-Do you, now? [chuckles]
-Yeah.

13:08.352 --> 13:10.398
We could, uh, we could have youliving like a real adult.

13:10.441 --> 13:12.269
-BUCK: Oh.
-ALI: Yeah.

13:12.313 --> 13:14.228
-[chuckles]
-This would be my first place

13:14.271 --> 13:16.099
all on my own.

13:16.143 --> 13:18.928
Oh. I assumed
you'd be living here together.

13:18.972 --> 13:20.974
Oh, uh, no.

13:21.017 --> 13:22.889
-[chuckles]
-No, this is...
She's just my decorator.

13:22.932 --> 13:24.281
[laughs]:
Uh, no. We, uh...

13:24.325 --> 13:26.718
We're just not quite
at that stage yet.

13:26.762 --> 13:28.068
ALI:
Yeah, not quite.

13:28.111 --> 13:30.244
We're at the stage where
I'm ready for his man cave

13:30.287 --> 13:32.115
to get a little more
natural light.

13:32.159 --> 13:33.856
I travel a lot for work,

13:33.900 --> 13:35.466
-and he's...
-Better than a hotel.

13:35.510 --> 13:37.991
-ALI: Oh, yeah. A lot better.
-[Buck laughs]

13:39.383 --> 13:41.951
[whispers]:
Let's talk closet space.

13:41.995 --> 13:45.128
â™ª

13:45.172 --> 13:47.087
Hey, guys, it's Becca.

13:47.130 --> 13:48.653
I'm back from Belize,

13:48.697 --> 13:51.874
and I am super pumped
to tell you all about my trip

13:51.918 --> 13:55.008
and the amazing new products
I tried.

13:55.051 --> 13:57.793
So, thanks to my partnership
with Pouty Gal Lip Wear,

13:57.837 --> 14:00.274
we got to tour all over.

14:00.317 --> 14:02.885
The Belizeans are so adore,

14:02.929 --> 14:05.801
and, like, even though
they don't have a lot of money

14:05.845 --> 14:09.457
or whatever, they're still,
like, super happy to serve you

14:09.500 --> 14:12.939
and always smiling,
and I just love them.

14:12.982 --> 14:16.333
I mean, I'm, like, totally
reeling from all that travel,

14:16.377 --> 14:18.727
but, you know,
that's the life I chose.

14:18.770 --> 14:20.555
Like, putting myself out there

14:20.598 --> 14:23.471
to find you guys
next-level products

14:23.514 --> 14:27.170
to make you look
and feel beautiful,

14:27.214 --> 14:29.564
even when I don't.

14:29.607 --> 14:32.349
'Cause you see this?

14:32.393 --> 14:35.613
Oh. Oh, gosh.
This is so gross, you guys.

14:35.657 --> 14:38.138
Okay, well, um, it happens.

14:38.181 --> 14:40.096
You know, this is real life,

14:40.140 --> 14:43.143
and I'm always gonna keep it 100with you guys,

14:43.186 --> 14:46.059
which is why today
I will be showing you

14:46.102 --> 14:49.018
the proper way to pop a pimple.

14:51.020 --> 14:53.762
What you want to do...

14:53.805 --> 14:56.373
is start away

14:56.417 --> 14:59.724
from the whitehead
and just gently apply pressure

14:59.768 --> 15:01.291
to the surrounding area.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.510
Like... [inhales sharply]

15:02.553 --> 15:04.642
Just squeeze, like...

15:04.686 --> 15:07.341
Oh, God, you guys.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.386
Oh, this is the worst zit ever.

15:09.430 --> 15:11.084
Ow. [inhales sharply]

15:11.127 --> 15:13.129
[groaning]

15:15.001 --> 15:17.003
Oh, ow.

15:19.135 --> 15:21.398
What? [screams]

15:21.442 --> 15:22.878
Mommy! Mommy! Get it off!

15:22.922 --> 15:24.097
Get it off! Get it off!

15:24.140 --> 15:27.230
[glass breaking]

15:27.274 --> 15:29.363
-Siri!
-[phone chimes]

15:29.406 --> 15:32.148
Call 911.

15:33.193 --> 15:35.021
Help.

15:35.064 --> 15:36.892
Over here. My arm.

15:36.936 --> 15:38.415
-Guys?
-Yeah.

15:38.459 --> 15:40.374
I can feel it,
but I can't move it.

15:40.417 --> 15:42.376
Like, really hurts
on my shoulder.

15:42.419 --> 15:44.900
HEN:Looks like a fractured clavicle.

15:44.944 --> 15:47.163
-CHIMNEY:
We're gonna sit you up.
-HEN: Okay.

15:47.207 --> 15:48.469
-There we go.
-Ow.

15:48.512 --> 15:51.037
Uh, dispatch said something
about an animal?

15:51.080 --> 15:53.343
Yeah, it, um,
came out of my face.

15:53.387 --> 15:56.825
What are we looking for,
exactly?

15:56.868 --> 15:58.218
It was like
a little, little worm.

15:58.261 --> 16:00.394
-Or like a grub, maybe.
-Like a maggot?

16:00.437 --> 16:01.830
Oh, don't say "maggot."

16:01.873 --> 16:04.398
-Maggot.
-You been out
of the country lately?

16:04.441 --> 16:07.009
Uh, yeah, I actually do
a lot of traveling for work.

16:07.053 --> 16:10.621
-What do you do?
-Uh, I'm a beauty
and fashion influencer.

16:10.665 --> 16:12.623
HEN:
Has your circle
of influence included

16:12.667 --> 16:14.277
Central and South America?

16:14.321 --> 16:15.887
BECCA:
No. No.

16:15.931 --> 16:17.802
I mean, I did just get back
from Belize.

16:17.846 --> 16:19.674
Belize is in Central America.

16:19.717 --> 16:21.502
Oh. Are you sure?

16:21.545 --> 16:23.504
-Pretty sure.
-Botfly.

16:23.547 --> 16:26.637
Parasite indigenous
to Central and South America,

16:26.681 --> 16:29.423
including Belize. They reproduceby trapping mosquitoes

16:29.466 --> 16:30.685
and laying their eggs on them.

16:30.728 --> 16:32.121
And then when
the mosquito lands on you,

16:32.165 --> 16:33.296
the egg hatches

16:33.340 --> 16:35.037
and crawls
right into the feeding site.

16:35.081 --> 16:36.821
BUCK:
Luckily it looks like

16:36.865 --> 16:39.172
you got it out all in one piece.

16:39.215 --> 16:41.087
They'll be able to extract
the rest at the hospital.

16:41.130 --> 16:43.611
-The rest?-Think of them as new followers.

16:43.654 --> 16:45.917
-[chuckles]
-Gross!

16:45.961 --> 16:48.268
Let's get you up.
[grunts]

16:48.311 --> 16:50.096
Ow.

16:58.713 --> 16:59.931
Oh, my God, wait.

16:59.975 --> 17:01.846
No, no, no, no,
can somebody grab my phone?

17:01.890 --> 17:03.326
No, go back. Hand me my phone.

17:03.370 --> 17:05.067
Wait, you guys. [groans]

17:05.111 --> 17:08.288
Hi, guys. Later.

17:08.331 --> 17:10.072
[Michael groans]

17:10.116 --> 17:11.639
First place.

17:11.682 --> 17:13.336
A-plus, my man.

17:13.380 --> 17:14.685
MAY:
It's a science project, Dad.

17:14.729 --> 17:16.339
He didn't, like, get into MIT.

17:16.383 --> 17:18.472
Hey,
it's an engineering project.

17:18.515 --> 17:21.518
Kid takes after his pops.
What can I say?

17:23.129 --> 17:24.304
Hey, what's that?

17:24.347 --> 17:27.872
Uh... package for Mom.

17:27.916 --> 17:29.700
Harry! Don't move!

17:40.276 --> 17:42.148
Contact the bomb squad.

17:42.191 --> 17:43.932
[horn honks]

17:48.806 --> 17:50.765
You guys okay?

17:50.808 --> 17:52.114
Yeah, we're fine.

17:52.158 --> 17:54.116
[exhales]

17:54.160 --> 17:56.249
Oh.

17:56.292 --> 17:59.295
-Oh. Oh, thank God
you were here.
-You know,

17:59.339 --> 18:01.123
-something just looked wrong,
you know?
-BOYD: Sergeant Grant.

18:01.167 --> 18:02.559
ATHENA:
Yeah.

18:02.603 --> 18:05.127
Shawn Boyd. ATF.
I'm running point

18:05.171 --> 18:06.172
on the serial bomber task force.

18:06.215 --> 18:07.782
ATHENA:
So it's confirmed?

18:07.825 --> 18:09.566
I'm on this guy's mailing list?

18:09.610 --> 18:11.786
We think so.

18:16.443 --> 18:19.315
Gold foil seems to be consistentwith the other three bombings.

18:19.359 --> 18:22.231
-Three?-We found another this morning.

18:22.275 --> 18:23.624
Vernon Clemmons.

18:23.667 --> 18:25.191
L.A. Superior Court judge.
You know him?

18:25.234 --> 18:27.367
ATHENA:
I've been in his courtroom
more than once.

18:27.410 --> 18:29.020
Is he okay?

18:29.064 --> 18:30.892
Pronounced dead on the scene.

19:00.443 --> 19:03.272
-Are you gonna take it with you?-We're gonna try.

19:03.316 --> 19:06.188
Could be some valuable evidenceinside that box.

19:06.232 --> 19:07.581
Every package has gone off
as soon as someone...

19:09.365 --> 19:12.890
-...moves it.
-That was it?

19:15.676 --> 19:18.418
[indistinct radio chatter]

19:18.461 --> 19:21.421
Oh, give me a second.
Thank you, Officer.

19:21.464 --> 19:24.598
Yeah. Hey, I got here
as fast as I could.

19:24.641 --> 19:26.252
They wouldn't let me
down the street.

19:26.295 --> 19:29.559
Oh. Do they have any idea
who's doing this?

19:29.603 --> 19:32.562
Yeah, well, I keep running it
in my head.

19:32.606 --> 19:35.565
I was at the first bombing, butthe woman doesn't look familiar.

19:35.609 --> 19:37.306
Not her name or her face.

19:37.350 --> 19:38.829
They say she's a defense lawyer.

19:38.873 --> 19:41.441
We must've crossed paths,
but I-I just...

19:41.484 --> 19:42.920
You've been doing this
for a while.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.487
You're not gonna remember everyattorney you've ever met.

19:44.531 --> 19:47.664
They also showed me a photo
of the insurance adjuster.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.450
He didn't look familiar, but
the only one that I am sure of

19:50.493 --> 19:52.495
is Judge Clemmons.

19:52.539 --> 19:55.106
-Clemmons? Why does that
sound familiar?
-Sergeant Grant.

19:55.150 --> 19:57.631
Do you remember working an arsoncase about three years back?

19:57.674 --> 19:59.502
It was a restaurant.

19:59.546 --> 20:01.069
Guillermo's.

20:01.112 --> 20:04.159
I, um-- Agent Boyd, this is
Captain Nash of LAFD.

20:04.203 --> 20:06.117
We worked on that case together.

20:06.161 --> 20:08.859
It's the only time I've had to
testify since I moved to L.A.

20:08.903 --> 20:11.253
The owner was Victor Costas.

20:11.297 --> 20:13.516
He got six years.
Should still be in prison.

20:13.560 --> 20:15.866
Well, released early,
on account of he's dead.

20:15.910 --> 20:18.434
About three months ago.
Cancer.

20:18.478 --> 20:20.306
He had a wife and a kid.
A teenager.

20:20.349 --> 20:22.873
And the son, his son,
was really angry

20:22.917 --> 20:24.310
when his father got arrested.

20:24.353 --> 20:25.615
Father's dead.

20:25.659 --> 20:28.531
I wonder how angry he is now.

20:28.575 --> 20:31.273
I can't help you.
I don't know where Freddie is.

20:31.317 --> 20:33.406
I haven't seen him since
Victor's funeral.

20:33.449 --> 20:35.059
Yeah, I heard about
your husband's death.

20:35.103 --> 20:36.235
I'm sorry for your loss.

20:37.584 --> 20:39.194
Are you?

20:39.238 --> 20:41.283
You put him in there.

20:41.327 --> 20:43.329
Now you want to
put Freddie away, too.

20:43.372 --> 20:46.419
He's hurt a lot of people,
Mrs. Costas.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.421
Killed a judge.

20:48.464 --> 20:50.292
I don't know anything
about that.

20:50.336 --> 20:52.947
ROMERO:
Maybe. At first.

20:52.990 --> 20:57.517
Mrs. Filson defends criminals.
Probably had a lot of enemies.

20:57.560 --> 20:58.735
Then the insurance adjuster,

20:58.779 --> 21:00.694
who's on life support,
by the way,

21:00.737 --> 21:01.956
you told yourself what?

21:01.999 --> 21:05.307
It was a coincidence?
Couldn't be true?

21:05.351 --> 21:08.571
We lost everything.

21:08.615 --> 21:10.660
Insurance wouldn't pay.

21:10.704 --> 21:12.793
All our creditors sued us.

21:12.836 --> 21:16.536
We sold everything we had
to pay for that lawyer,

21:16.579 --> 21:17.667
and what did we get?

21:17.711 --> 21:19.495
A death sentence.

21:19.539 --> 21:22.498
Prison brokemy husband,

21:22.542 --> 21:24.544
and then it killed him.

21:24.587 --> 21:27.373
So Freddie was angry.

21:27.416 --> 21:29.549
At the lawyer, at the judge,

21:29.592 --> 21:31.333
at the insurance company.

21:31.377 --> 21:33.292
Who else is he angry at,
Mrs. Costas?

21:34.641 --> 21:36.817
Bomb squad just cleared
your home, Captain Nash.

21:36.860 --> 21:37.905
Nothing there.

21:37.948 --> 21:39.559
Well, I guess that's a relief.

21:39.602 --> 21:41.125
It doesn't make sense, though.

21:41.169 --> 21:43.563
I was there the day
his father was arrested.

21:43.606 --> 21:44.955
He said you blew up their lives.

21:44.999 --> 21:46.696
Maybe he's saving
Captain Nash for last.

21:46.740 --> 21:49.090
Hasn't sent the bomb yet.

21:50.657 --> 21:53.399
Or maybe you searched
the wrong house.

21:53.442 --> 21:54.878
[alarm ringing]

21:56.315 --> 21:58.317
[excited chatter]

22:06.629 --> 22:08.631
DISPATCH:
118, 118, this is Dispatch.

22:08.675 --> 22:11.242
Got Bobby Nash on the line.
He says it's important.

22:11.286 --> 22:14.245
Wait, what? Dispatch?

22:14.289 --> 22:16.422
Dispatch, please repeat.

22:23.254 --> 22:25.256
[car alarm blaring]

22:41.838 --> 22:43.797
Ow. Oh!

22:43.840 --> 22:46.365
[grunting]

22:48.497 --> 22:51.282
[gasping]

23:01.336 --> 23:03.338
You're new.

23:15.698 --> 23:17.352
DWIGHT:
If you're just joining us,

23:17.396 --> 23:18.832
witnesses are reporting
that this LAFD ladder truck,

23:18.875 --> 23:21.574
belonging to station house 118,

23:21.617 --> 23:23.489
was hit by some kind of
an explosive

23:23.532 --> 23:25.055
as it was making its way
to a call.

23:25.099 --> 23:27.057
Now, you can see
there's a firefighter

23:27.101 --> 23:29.016
pinned under that truck...

23:29.059 --> 23:31.279
MADDIE:
Looks like a crush injury.

23:31.322 --> 23:33.150
Those can be tricky.

23:33.194 --> 23:35.892
Hypovolemic shock.
Hyperkalemia.

23:37.067 --> 23:39.026
[crying]:
He's all alone.

23:39.069 --> 23:40.636
JOSH:
He's not.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.160
He's surrounded by people
who want to help him.

23:43.204 --> 23:44.597
Then how come
no one's running in there?

23:44.640 --> 23:47.861
They can't. You know that.

23:47.904 --> 23:49.819
We've got a perimeter set up,
but we're just guessing

23:49.863 --> 23:51.342
the blast radius on that thing.

23:51.386 --> 23:52.735
Can't toss him a phone.
We're not sure what kind

23:52.779 --> 23:55.042
-of signal he's operating on.
-CHIMNEY: Dispatch,

23:55.085 --> 23:57.305
this is Captain 118. What is theplay? I've got people

23:57.348 --> 23:58.175
dying in the street.

23:58.219 --> 23:59.394
Hold your position, 118.

23:59.438 --> 24:02.702
FREDDIE:
Get me the captain!

24:02.745 --> 24:05.705
Where's the captain?!

24:05.748 --> 24:07.184
Hey,

24:07.228 --> 24:10.579
I told you not to move.

24:11.667 --> 24:12.929
Cap-Cap...

24:12.973 --> 24:15.715
-Cap!
-I'm the captain, okay?

24:15.758 --> 24:19.370
I'm the captain, so please justlet me help them, okay? Please.

24:19.414 --> 24:22.417
No. No, I don't want you.

24:23.940 --> 24:25.202
I want Captain Nash.

24:27.944 --> 24:30.033
I love you.

24:32.122 --> 24:34.298
Captain Nash!
Don't confront him!

24:34.342 --> 24:36.213
-He wants me.
-He wants you dead!

24:36.257 --> 24:38.520
-Let's give him what he wants.
-Captain Nash!

24:38.564 --> 24:40.479
Shoot me if you have to.

24:43.743 --> 24:46.572
DWIGHT:
This is unexpected.
A civilian now

24:46.615 --> 24:48.399
confronting the young man
with that vest.

24:48.443 --> 24:50.750
We've got no details
on this man's identity.

24:50.793 --> 24:53.013
Freddie!

24:59.019 --> 25:01.412
Thought you'd be on the truck.

25:01.456 --> 25:03.327
I'm here now.

25:03.371 --> 25:04.546
[phone vibrating]

25:04.590 --> 25:06.548
How far away are you?

25:06.592 --> 25:08.811
What's next?

25:08.855 --> 25:10.378
It's what you wanted.

25:10.421 --> 25:11.597
Wanted you dead.

25:11.640 --> 25:13.120
I get that.

25:13.163 --> 25:14.904
But what about them?

25:14.948 --> 25:17.951
-What about him?
-[groaning]

25:17.994 --> 25:20.344
He's got parents,
a sister, a girlfriend,

25:20.388 --> 25:22.608
and he never did anything
to you.

25:22.651 --> 25:24.174
He wasn't even a firefighter

25:24.218 --> 25:26.481
when your father burned down
that restaurant.

25:26.525 --> 25:28.527
Collateral damage.

25:30.050 --> 25:32.182
Is that how you see yourself?

25:32.226 --> 25:34.489
-An unintended victim
in all this?
-Stop.

25:34.533 --> 25:36.796
One more step, we all go boom.

25:36.839 --> 25:41.496
Freddie, you got dealt a badhand, and I am sorry about that.

25:41.540 --> 25:44.847
But what you did with it--
that's a choice.

25:44.891 --> 25:48.634
You stopped being a victim themoment you left that first bomb.

25:48.677 --> 25:51.680
-That lawyer! She...
-Did her job.

25:53.247 --> 25:55.597
We were all doing our jobs.

25:55.641 --> 25:58.208
Destroying my family.

25:58.252 --> 26:01.734
My mom and I lost everything.

26:01.777 --> 26:04.432
She was in so much pain.

26:04.475 --> 26:06.652
Want to make it worse? You wantto make her watch you die?

26:13.093 --> 26:14.834
Freddie.

26:14.877 --> 26:16.618
Mom.

26:16.662 --> 26:18.620

Hang on, Buck.

26:55.091 --> 26:56.658
This is Captain 118.

26:56.702 --> 26:58.573
We've got
a probable crush injury.

26:58.617 --> 27:00.706
I need all hands on deck
to move this truck

27:00.749 --> 27:02.925
and clear a path
to the nearest trauma center.

27:02.969 --> 27:05.058
-How's he doing, Chimney?
-We're out of time, Cap.

27:05.101 --> 27:07.060
All right, let's try
to lift this off him, yeah?

Well, that firefighter

27:13.153 --> 27:15.808
really appears to have taken
the brunt of all of this.

27:15.851 --> 27:18.724
That's an entire ladder truck
that you see there.

27:18.767 --> 27:20.726
We can only hope
for the best at this point.

27:20.769 --> 27:22.815

we can use for leverage?

No. We need more people.

Did he say anything about
how the surgery went?

30:44.364 --> 30:47.019
Just that you made it through.

30:47.062 --> 30:51.284
And you're now the proud owner
of one titanium rod and four

30:51.327 --> 30:54.330
beautifully cobalt-chromed
screws. [chuckles]

30:55.723 --> 30:57.507
You were hoping for
something more?

30:57.551 --> 31:01.033
Before they wheeled me in,
he, uh...

31:01.076 --> 31:04.253
he said he didn't know
how it was gonna go.

31:04.297 --> 31:06.038
You'll walk again.

31:06.081 --> 31:08.779
Yeah. He-he said...

31:08.823 --> 31:11.913
he said he was pretty confidentabout that.

31:11.957 --> 31:17.179
He, uh, he just-- he didn't knowif I would ever...

31:17.223 --> 31:19.051
work again.

31:21.183 --> 31:24.143
Okay, I'm not gonna lie to you

31:24.186 --> 31:27.146
and tell you that
it's gonna be all right.

31:27.189 --> 31:31.977
But I don't think you need to beborrowing trouble, not yet.

31:32.020 --> 31:35.328
Let's just take this moment
and be glad that you're alive.

31:38.244 --> 31:39.288
Ali seems nice.

31:39.332 --> 31:42.813
-You met Ali?
-Mm.

31:42.857 --> 31:44.337
So we're into brunettes now.

31:44.380 --> 31:47.557
She was actually blonde
when I met her.

31:47.601 --> 31:49.168
Oh, so we're just gonna cover
the waterfront.

31:49.211 --> 31:50.865
-Carla...
-[both laughing]

31:53.128 --> 31:54.390
ALI:
He's awake.

31:54.434 --> 31:56.305
-Hi.
-Hey.

31:56.349 --> 31:58.438
Hey...

32:01.223 --> 32:02.442
Hey.

32:06.620 --> 32:09.188
You were in surgery for a while.

32:09.231 --> 32:11.407
Too long.

32:11.451 --> 32:14.323
Thank you for being here.

32:14.367 --> 32:17.065
I would like it noted that
he didn't thank either of us.

32:17.109 --> 32:19.894
-Girl, I don't think he knows
we're still in the room.
-Right?

32:19.938 --> 32:21.200
[Carla laughs]

32:23.245 --> 32:26.596
KAREN:
It's Caltech, part-time.

32:26.640 --> 32:30.861
So it'd be half the moneybut twice as many hours at home.

32:30.905 --> 32:34.604
HEN [chuckles]:
Remember when working remotely
wasn't even a thing?

32:34.648 --> 32:36.476
KAREN [laughs]:
Like it was yesterday.

32:36.519 --> 32:41.002
I guess in the grand scheme
of time, it was yesterday.

32:41.046 --> 32:43.091
If only you could do that.

32:43.135 --> 32:44.788
[laughs]
Bite your tongue.

32:44.832 --> 32:47.139
The day I'm working from home,
our damn house is on fire.

32:47.182 --> 32:49.228
[laughs]

32:49.271 --> 32:53.623
I figure it'll be good to have
more time with Denny...

32:53.667 --> 32:57.062
and anyone else
who might come along.

32:58.106 --> 33:01.240
-You see what you did there?
-[laughs]

33:01.283 --> 33:05.592
Just dropped it, quiet-like.

33:05.635 --> 33:07.942
Well, I've been thinking.

33:07.986 --> 33:10.466
I am a woman of a certain age...

33:10.510 --> 33:13.948
HEN:Well, if there's anybody who canstrong-arm Mother Nature,

33:13.992 --> 33:16.211
it's you.

33:18.431 --> 33:20.041
Are you serious about this?

33:20.085 --> 33:23.262
[sighs] It's not like we never
talked about it.

33:23.305 --> 33:25.481
We had a whole plan and then...

33:25.525 --> 33:27.048
HEN:
Denny.

33:27.092 --> 33:29.268
KAREN:
We weren't sure
if we were making

33:29.311 --> 33:32.271
the right decision
that time either.

33:32.314 --> 33:34.621
But there has never been a day

33:34.664 --> 33:37.711
I regret choosing being his mom.

33:37.754 --> 33:39.539
Do you?

33:39.582 --> 33:41.845
You and that man

33:41.889 --> 33:44.109
are the two things
that get me home every day.

33:44.152 --> 33:49.027
A couple more footsteps stompingaround the house might be nice.

33:56.556 --> 33:58.645
[whistles]

33:58.688 --> 34:01.996
Now that is a hell of a thing.

34:02.040 --> 34:04.129
-It's a loaner.
-A loaner?

34:04.172 --> 34:05.652
Chim, for real?

34:05.695 --> 34:07.175
I'm kidding. We own it.

34:07.219 --> 34:09.221
With the caveat that we
are not allowed to flip,

34:09.264 --> 34:11.440
crash, or blow her up
any time soon.

34:11.484 --> 34:12.659
Oh.

34:12.702 --> 34:13.703
But I made no promises.

34:13.747 --> 34:14.704
Cap.

34:14.748 --> 34:16.315
You're back.

34:16.358 --> 34:17.881
I'm back.

34:17.925 --> 34:20.145
Well, it's kind of hard
to fire a guy

34:20.188 --> 34:21.711
who was a hero on the 6:00 news.

34:21.755 --> 34:23.148
Imagine the letters
they would get.

34:23.191 --> 34:25.324
HEN:
Not to mention
the fiery tweet-storm

34:25.367 --> 34:27.978
that'd rain down on their heads,starting with me.

34:28.022 --> 34:29.937
Welcome back, Cap.

34:29.980 --> 34:31.156
[laughs] About damn time.

34:31.199 --> 34:32.331
Thank you.

34:32.374 --> 34:34.202
Feels great to be home.

34:34.246 --> 34:36.726
But admit it, you do miss
Captain Han just a little.

34:36.770 --> 34:38.163
Not even a little.

34:38.206 --> 34:39.338
Things are finally getting back

34:39.381 --> 34:40.948
to the way they should be.

34:40.991 --> 34:43.777
Almost.

34:43.820 --> 34:45.605
Easy, okay?

34:45.648 --> 34:47.520
I don't want you to fall
and break the other one.

34:47.563 --> 34:50.175
I am just glad to be out
of the hospital.

34:50.218 --> 34:52.699
-Yeah?
-I miss my own bed...

34:52.742 --> 34:55.484
which I won't see
for the next three months.

34:55.528 --> 34:57.921
Guess I am sleeping down here.

34:57.965 --> 35:00.968
You're like
a perpetual roommate.

35:01.011 --> 35:02.752
Even in your own place.

35:02.796 --> 35:05.494
Lesson learned:
Never sign a lease

35:05.538 --> 35:07.714
if you intend on being crushed
by municipal equipment.

35:07.757 --> 35:10.847
Mm. Uh, or better idea?

35:10.891 --> 35:13.502
[Buck grunting]

35:13.546 --> 35:17.854
How about not get crushed
by municipal equipment?

35:17.898 --> 35:20.422
Huh. Now, why didn't
I think of that?

35:20.466 --> 35:22.120
I don't know. Mm.

35:25.035 --> 35:27.342
So...

35:27.386 --> 35:29.562
have you, uh, have you thought
about what's next?

35:29.605 --> 35:32.217
Once you take this thing off.
[laughs]

35:32.260 --> 35:36.046
Why? Did-did the doctor say
something to you?

35:36.090 --> 35:37.526
No.

35:37.570 --> 35:41.617
Um, I don't-- I don't know,
you know.

35:41.661 --> 35:43.750
I guess a lot of
physical therapy and then...

35:43.793 --> 35:46.883
You'll probably want to just
get right back out there.

35:48.058 --> 35:50.670
Yeah, of-of course, I mean...

35:50.713 --> 35:52.193
You know, wh-what else?

35:52.237 --> 35:53.760
Uh...

35:53.803 --> 35:56.241
What? Come on, what's going on?

35:57.503 --> 35:59.461
I watched you almost die, Evan.

35:59.505 --> 36:01.420
-Yeah, but I didn't.
-But you could have.

36:01.463 --> 36:02.247
But I didn't.

36:02.290 --> 36:04.988
I know. I...

36:05.032 --> 36:08.253
I know. Thank God.

36:08.296 --> 36:12.126
Look, I...
It's not like I didn't know

36:12.170 --> 36:15.303
you were in a dangerous line
of work

36:15.347 --> 36:17.087
when I met you, you know,
ten stories up

36:17.131 --> 36:18.393
of a collapsing high rise.

36:18.437 --> 36:20.787
-Exactly.
-That was one day...

36:20.830 --> 36:23.485
one day of my life, Evan.

36:23.529 --> 36:26.140
It's every day for you.

36:26.184 --> 36:29.056
I'm just starting
to really understand

36:29.099 --> 36:30.710
-what that means.
-Wait, so-so you want me

36:30.753 --> 36:33.408
to quit my job, that's what
you're asking me to do?

36:33.452 --> 36:35.889
No, I would never-- I would
never ask you to do that.

36:35.932 --> 36:37.020
Listen.

36:37.064 --> 36:39.719
I know it's who you are.

36:39.762 --> 36:41.503
I'm just not sure...

36:41.547 --> 36:44.071
If it's who you are.

36:46.204 --> 36:47.727
Hey.

36:51.383 --> 36:53.646
I don't know yet.

36:53.689 --> 36:56.214
Okay?

37:02.002 --> 37:04.526
Hi.

37:05.527 --> 37:06.702
Hi.

37:06.746 --> 37:09.270
Right. What am I doing here?

37:09.314 --> 37:11.751
Um...

37:11.794 --> 37:14.884
I asked you if things
were ever gonna be the same

37:14.928 --> 37:17.147
and you said no.

37:17.191 --> 37:20.977
You know, I've been thinking
about that a lot, too.

37:21.021 --> 37:23.415
And, uh, I think maybe
I was wrong.

37:23.458 --> 37:24.546
I think you were right.

37:24.590 --> 37:27.462
But that's okay because...

37:27.506 --> 37:30.335
We're never gonna get back
what we would have had.

37:30.378 --> 37:33.816
But maybe we could have
something else.

37:36.471 --> 37:37.690
[sighs]

37:37.733 --> 37:39.692
You know, you were standing
right there

37:39.735 --> 37:42.085
when you asked me out
on a date, and, uh,

37:42.129 --> 37:44.131
I'm not sure I'd ever been
so happy.

37:45.785 --> 37:47.482
Until right now.

37:56.274 --> 37:58.276
â™ª

38:07.546 --> 38:10.331
Hey! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Come on, be careful.

38:10.375 --> 38:12.377
Uh, were you gonna sewthese two pieces back together?

38:12.420 --> 38:14.248
I don't think so.

38:14.292 --> 38:15.728
Doesn't mean
you had to rip them.

38:16.816 --> 38:18.731
Uh-huh. Looks terrible.

38:18.774 --> 38:20.428
It's gonna be fine, okay?

38:20.472 --> 38:22.430
We're just gonna tuck it
in the top of your cast.

38:22.474 --> 38:24.040
I don't even know why
I'm taking you.

38:24.084 --> 38:26.434
You shouldn't be on your feet;
you need to be healing.

38:26.478 --> 38:28.218
Well, this is more important.

38:28.262 --> 38:30.830
If I break anything else,
they can just fix that, too,

38:30.873 --> 38:32.048
with the other stuff.

38:32.092 --> 38:34.486
Wait. What other stuff?

38:34.529 --> 38:37.184
They want me to have
another surgery.

38:37.227 --> 38:40.622
Uh, doctor wasn't happywith what he saw on the X-rays,

38:40.666 --> 38:41.928
so he wants to go back in

38:41.971 --> 38:44.713
and replace the rod
and do some bone grafts.

38:44.757 --> 38:47.412
Well, do they think it's
a delayed union or nonunion?

38:47.455 --> 38:50.763
I mean, if it's just healing
slower than expected,

38:50.806 --> 38:52.373
you could just wait a few weeks.

38:52.417 --> 38:53.331
I'm not waiting.

38:54.593 --> 38:55.768
The sooner I have the surgery,

38:55.811 --> 38:58.118
sooner I can go back to work.

38:59.467 --> 39:02.122
So the doctor does want you
to wait.

39:03.210 --> 39:05.430
You should listen to him.

39:05.473 --> 39:08.302
Okay. We're talking
about your health.

39:08.346 --> 39:09.608
Your ability to walk.

39:09.651 --> 39:11.087
We're talking about
the rest of your life.

39:11.131 --> 39:15.004
No, being a firefighter
is my life.

39:15.048 --> 39:19.095
It is the, the only thing I haveever done that was important

39:19.139 --> 39:21.794
and that mattered, okay?

39:21.837 --> 39:24.666
Without that,
I-I-I don't have...

39:24.710 --> 39:27.539
You will still be Buck,

39:27.582 --> 39:29.845
okay, and we will all love you.

39:29.889 --> 39:33.588
There are lots
of other important things

39:33.632 --> 39:36.112
that you can do with your life.

39:36.156 --> 39:38.811
No.

39:40.073 --> 39:42.423
No, I've already made my choice.

39:44.686 --> 39:48.516
BOBBY:
People assume
we choose this life.

39:48.560 --> 39:50.562
I'm not so sure.

39:50.605 --> 39:53.608
Sometimes I think
this life chooses us.

39:53.652 --> 39:55.262
For those that answer the call,

39:55.305 --> 39:58.352
there can be no doubt,
no equivocation.

39:58.396 --> 40:01.660
It's not just the lives of thosewe serve that depend on us,

40:01.703 --> 40:03.096
but our own.

40:03.139 --> 40:04.576
The lives

40:04.619 --> 40:07.492
of our fellow firefighters
and first responders.

40:07.535 --> 40:11.931
Today we welcomeinto those ranks a new brother.

40:11.974 --> 40:14.586
After a year of hard work
and dedication,

40:14.629 --> 40:17.589
I am proud to officially declare

40:17.632 --> 40:21.114
that your probationary period
is at an end.

40:21.157 --> 40:24.509
Welcome to the Los Angeles
Fire Department,

40:24.552 --> 40:27.337
-Firefighter Diaz.
-Thank you, sir.

40:27.381 --> 40:28.991
[cheering, applause]

40:39.524 --> 40:42.135
â™ª Oh, for once in my...â™ª

40:42.178 --> 40:45.138
What do you got for me, son?

40:45.181 --> 40:47.532
I got your helmet.

40:47.575 --> 40:49.751
Yeah, my helmet? Oh!

40:49.795 --> 40:51.057
â™ª Could just something goâ™ª

40:51.100 --> 40:52.537
[applause]

40:52.580 --> 40:54.626
â™ª Could just something
go right?â™ª

40:54.669 --> 40:56.671
Congratulations, Dad.

40:56.715 --> 40:58.717
[laughs]:
Oh...

40:58.760 --> 41:01.371
Thank you so much, Christopher.

41:01.415 --> 41:04.897
ATHENA:
An emergency
is the absence of choice.

41:06.768 --> 41:09.554
The randomness of the world...

41:09.597 --> 41:11.556
â™ª Oh, for once in my...â™ª

41:11.599 --> 41:13.732
...the crazy chaos of life,

41:13.775 --> 41:16.778
robbing us of our safety...

41:18.606 --> 41:20.173
...our illusions.

41:20.216 --> 41:23.437
But in those moments
of darkness...

41:23.481 --> 41:24.656
â™ª Go right?â™ª

41:24.699 --> 41:28.137
...and fear, we call out

41:28.181 --> 41:34.361
to the light up ahead,
to the people we love.

41:34.404 --> 41:36.929
We steal back that choice,

41:36.972 --> 41:40.323
and we choose each other.

41:40.367 --> 41:45.415
We choose
friendship and family.

41:45.459 --> 41:48.680
We choose hope.

41:48.723 --> 41:52.074
We choose joy.

41:54.990 --> 41:58.951
We choose to live.

41:58.994 --> 42:01.562
â™ª Oh, for once in my,
oh, for once in my life...â™ª

42:01.606 --> 42:03.216
Athena!

42:03.259 --> 42:06.175
Hey. This is a surprise.

42:06.219 --> 42:08.787
Figured you'd be going home
to sleep after your shift.

42:08.830 --> 42:10.266
-No, I wanted to see you first.-[chuckles]

42:10.310 --> 42:12.965
-That's so sweet.
-What are you doing today?

42:13.008 --> 42:18.144
Oh, let's see, laundry,
grocery shopping, the usual.

42:18.187 --> 42:19.580
What if we get married instead?

42:19.624 --> 42:21.234
-Whoa.
-Go to the courthouse,

42:21.277 --> 42:23.584
get our license, say our vows,
just do it.

42:23.628 --> 42:25.934
-[laughs]
-"You, me and the kids."

42:25.978 --> 42:27.719
That's all you said you needed.

42:27.762 --> 42:30.460
And we have that now, today.

42:30.504 --> 42:32.419
And if there's one thingyou and I know, it's that today

42:32.462 --> 42:33.812
is the only thing
you can be sure of.

42:33.855 --> 42:35.727
So let's not waste
another moment waiting.

42:35.770 --> 42:37.729
[laughs]

42:37.772 --> 42:39.948
-Mm...
-All right, I'll change,

42:39.992 --> 42:41.471
uh, we'll get
the kids from school.

42:41.515 --> 42:43.735
-I know you don't
have a dress, but...
-No

42:43.778 --> 42:47.042
I have a dress.

42:47.086 --> 42:49.610
â™ª All my life...â™ª

42:49.654 --> 42:55.224
So when the ground shifts
beneath our feet

42:55.268 --> 42:58.663
and the storms rage around us,

42:58.706 --> 43:03.668
it's all these people
that provide relief.

43:03.711 --> 43:08.847
And offer shelter.

43:08.890 --> 43:13.025
This is how we save ourselves,

43:13.068 --> 43:16.550
by saving each other.

43:18.465 --> 43:23.035
Because nobody, not anybody,

43:23.078 --> 43:25.690
has ever been saved alone.
