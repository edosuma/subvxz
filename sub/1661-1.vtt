00:57.140 --> 00:59.391
All right, we're good to go.

00:59.517 --> 01:02.311
You got this?
You bet your ass, bubba.

01:02.854 --> 01:04.813
Let's make some money!

01:10.904 --> 01:12.196
Everyone in position.

01:14.491 --> 01:16.867
I thought we'd be
robbing banks by now,

01:16.951 --> 01:19.328
not some gas truck
in the middle of nowhere.

01:19.412 --> 01:22.081
Down here, gas is gold, bubba.

01:30.799 --> 01:32.841
</font>Kill the chatter!
Game time.

01:32.926 --> 01:35.260
I wouldn't piss him off, guys.

01:56.241 --> 01:58.219
</font> Okay, guys,
we're gonna have to hit
this hard and fast.

01:58.243 --> 02:01.078
We got four K left
before the downgrade.

02:22.225 --> 02:24.017
Locked and loaded!

02:49.836 --> 02:51.920
This is all you, Han.

02:57.343 --> 02:59.011
Liquid gold.

03:06.311 --> 03:07.352
We're clear.

03:07.437 --> 03:08.604
Okay, T, you're up.

03:12.650 --> 03:15.694
Let's see if you can
get it under six tries
this time, huh, T?

03:18.907 --> 03:22.034
It's more like three.
Come on, Tego,
keep it real.

03:38.676 --> 03:42.221
Just one K left. We're running out of road.
Get in there, brother.

03:42.305 --> 03:44.139
I got it, l got it.

03:53.441 --> 03:54.608
Shit!

04:00.073 --> 04:02.699
T, cut loose!
Unhitch, unhitch!

04:49.038 --> 04:51.957
Spray that hitch!
I don't have a hammer!

04:52.041 --> 04:53.542
Just do it!

05:08.224 --> 05:09.558
Hold on! Hold on!

05:09.642 --> 05:11.143
No shit!

05:13.396 --> 05:15.522
Hold onto something tight!

05:39.297 --> 05:40.672
</font> Letty!

05:40.757 --> 05:43.008
Give me your hand!
I can't reach!

05:43.092 --> 05:44.760
You got to jump!

06:10.995 --> 06:12.162
Jump!

06:13.664 --> 06:15.165
Letty, jump!

06:19.796 --> 06:21.296
L've got you!

06:54.455 --> 06:55.705
Dom...

06:58.126 --> 06:59.251
Dom?

07:03.339 --> 07:04.506
Dom!

08:15.286 --> 08:16.870
</font> How you doing?

08:18.581 --> 08:20.123
</font> Money, money!

08:21.459 --> 08:22.626
Good.

08:25.254 --> 08:27.172
</font> Yo, why your stack
is bigger than mine always?

08:27.256 --> 08:29.090
</font> l'm supersized, baby.

08:38.934 --> 08:41.727
Cops just raided
our garage in Baracoa.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.065
They were real
interested in you.

08:45.650 --> 08:50.403
Heat's on and we just
sent up a flare that's gonna
lead them right to us.

08:50.488 --> 08:53.573
I say we move out
first thing
in the morning.

08:54.951 --> 08:56.993
Nah, it's me they want.

08:57.620 --> 08:59.579
And if they catch me,

08:59.664 --> 09:02.666
they're throwing big numbers
at anybody with me.

09:05.836 --> 09:07.796
Han, we had a good run.

09:09.799 --> 09:12.551
Time for you to go
do your own thing.

09:16.472 --> 09:19.474
Heard they're doing
some crazy shit in Tokyo.

09:25.773 --> 09:27.691
Have you seen Letty?

09:40.246 --> 09:42.080
There she is.

09:48.087 --> 09:50.797
I hear Rio is nice
this time of year.

09:54.427 --> 09:56.720
The cops are getting hungrier.

09:56.804 --> 09:59.222
Then l guess
we're doing our job.

10:03.978 --> 10:05.937
I'm a walking target.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.816
I don't want you
around when they catch up to me.

10:11.569 --> 10:14.404
"Ride or die," remember?

10:15.698 --> 10:18.533
Dom, how long
have we been doing this?

10:20.578 --> 10:24.372
And now all of a sudden,
out of nowhere, it's too dangerous?

10:25.041 --> 10:26.541
Come on.

10:31.547 --> 10:34.633
We'll figure it out.
We always do.

14:01.715 --> 14:02.901
I don't know shit!
Give me a name!

14:02.925 --> 14:05.009
I don't know shit, man!
Give me a name!

14:05.094 --> 14:08.096
David Park!
David Park's the guy you want!

14:08.681 --> 14:09.806
Please!

14:17.481 --> 14:20.817
Thank God. Listen, he's in a mood
because yesterday was his cheat day,

14:20.901 --> 14:22.861
and then today,
some genius brought in donuts.

14:22.945 --> 14:24.153
Great.

14:25.447 --> 14:27.073
</font> Sorry l'm late.

14:28.409 --> 14:32.704
Complaints keep rolling in after your
little downtown Olympics, O'Conner.

14:32.788 --> 14:35.957
Tell me that reinstating you
wasn't a mistake.

14:36.041 --> 14:39.210
I got a name.
David Park. That's it?

14:39.295 --> 14:41.754
That's all you got?
David Park?

14:41.839 --> 14:44.776
I could throw a fortune cookie out this
window and hit 50 David Parks right now.

14:44.800 --> 14:47.468
It's Korean,
not Chinese. Whatever.

14:48.137 --> 14:52.724
Park is a scout that recruits street
racers to be mules for the Braga cartel.

14:52.808 --> 14:55.393
We find Park,
and we bust the bad guys.

15:20.377 --> 15:21.711
</font> Dom.

15:21.795 --> 15:24.464
Mia, l told you
not to call me here.

15:24.965 --> 15:26.674
Dom, it's Letty.

15:27.635 --> 15:29.469
She's been murdered.

15:45.152 --> 15:49.614
</font> We have gathered here to pay
our final respects to...

15:49.698 --> 15:52.867
Let us reflect on her journey...

15:56.622 --> 16:01.334
"The Lord is my shepherd,
l shall not want. He makes me lie down..."

16:21.188 --> 16:23.982
Facial recognition software
matched Toretto

16:24.066 --> 16:25.900
about 1 0 minutes after
he crossed the border.

16:28.862 --> 16:30.488
I don't get it.

16:30.698 --> 16:32.573
I thought he'd show.

17:27.296 --> 17:30.089
I told you not to come.
They're staking the place out.

17:30.174 --> 17:32.633
If they find you...
They won't.

17:35.471 --> 17:38.639
Come on.
Look at you.

18:04.917 --> 18:07.376
Letty wouldn't let them junk it.

18:09.046 --> 18:11.547
Even though it is
a goddamn curse.

18:14.343 --> 18:17.303
When she came back,
she was always in here,

18:18.347 --> 18:20.848
working on it day and night.

18:26.480 --> 18:28.106
It was weird.

18:29.733 --> 18:32.693
It was like she knew
you were coming back.

18:34.738 --> 18:37.073
I want to see the crash site.

18:42.704 --> 18:46.165
</font> l just got off the phone
with Deputy Director Lawson.

18:46.875 --> 18:50.294
If we don't make serious inroads into
the Braga case in the next 72 hours,

18:50.379 --> 18:52.630
they're gonna shut us down.

18:53.799 --> 18:56.342
I know l'm a newbie here,
but why the clock now?

18:56.426 --> 18:58.219
Because it's been two years,

18:58.303 --> 19:00.823
and the last three agents
we sent to infiltrate his organization

19:00.889 --> 19:03.266
came back in body bags.

19:03.350 --> 19:07.937
He's moved more heroin across the border
than Escobar did in 1 0 years.

19:08.021 --> 19:10.815
This guy is becoming one of our biggest
national threats,

19:10.899 --> 19:12.984
and we don't even
have a picture of him.

19:13.068 --> 19:16.571
We don't have prints!
Not even a goddamn DOB!

19:19.616 --> 19:21.826
What's the status on David Park?

19:21.910 --> 19:24.120
Isn't he our ticket into
the Braga organization?

19:24.204 --> 19:27.999
We're running the name through city and
county databases, sorting the possibilities.

19:28.083 --> 19:30.001
We've got over 500 already.

19:30.085 --> 19:33.129
Park's insignificant.
Sounds like another jerk-off to me.

19:33.213 --> 19:37.175
</font> lt's not. Without Park, Braga wouldn't
have drivers to move his shipments.

19:37.259 --> 19:40.011
Cross-check traffic.
Lllegal modifications.

19:40.095 --> 19:44.432
Street racing. This guy will definitely
have a record. We'll find him.

19:45.267 --> 19:46.726
We better.

19:47.311 --> 19:49.061
<font color="#D900D9">What do you know?

19:49.146 --> 19:52.815
Your boy Toretto's red Chevelle has
been spotted in his old neighborhood.

19:52.900 --> 19:54.692
I'm going to bring his ass in.

19:54.776 --> 19:57.028
Not in your car you're not.

20:05.787 --> 20:07.663
It's straight ahead.

22:13.415 --> 22:15.750
You found something back there.

22:20.672 --> 22:23.257
There were burn marks
on the ground.

22:26.386 --> 22:29.597
The kind that could
only be caused by nitrometh.

22:33.268 --> 22:36.604
There's only one guy in all of L.A.
that sells that.

22:40.609 --> 22:43.819
Nothing you can do is gonna bring
her back, Dom.

22:45.906 --> 22:48.199
If l were Letty,
l would ask you...

22:48.283 --> 22:51.869
No, l would beg you,
please, let this go.

22:53.080 --> 22:55.122
Before it's too late.

22:59.628 --> 23:01.545
It's already too late.

24:17.914 --> 24:20.249
I'm Michael Stasiak, FBl.

24:20.792 --> 24:23.377
Let's you and l
have a little chat.

24:44.900 --> 24:47.735
Hi. This is Forsythe
in Evidence.

24:47.819 --> 24:51.447
I need Stasiak down here right away
to sign some greenies.

24:51.531 --> 24:53.032
Thanks.

24:53.116 --> 24:54.658
Hi.
Hey.

24:54.743 --> 24:57.328
Okay, l narrowed it down
to 50 or so David Parks.

24:57.412 --> 24:59.849
What l'd like you to do is run the
make and model on each one of them.

24:59.873 --> 25:00.892
All right?
Okay. All right.

25:00.916 --> 25:02.166
Thank you.

25:12.802 --> 25:15.095
Hey, Tyler, we got a transfer.

25:17.265 --> 25:19.308
You want to come with me?

25:40.747 --> 25:41.997
Toretto.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.875
When'd you get back in town?

25:44.960 --> 25:47.836
I'm looking for a car
you did an engine mod on.

25:47.921 --> 25:52.424
Nitromethane tank. Ford full-size.
Continental tires.

25:54.344 --> 25:57.680
Look, what are you doing,
coming in here like this, huh?

25:58.223 --> 26:00.891
This ain't your scene
anymore, boss.

26:00.976 --> 26:03.686
Don't ever put your hands
on me again, okay?

26:03.770 --> 26:06.105
Say hi to your sister for me.

26:17.659 --> 26:20.995
A Korean kid brought it in.
David Park.

26:21.830 --> 26:24.164
It's a green Ford Torino.

26:25.166 --> 26:27.501
Please don't drop this on me!

26:32.382 --> 26:34.091
I'm almost done.

26:36.386 --> 26:39.847
Why don't you tell me
why you dragged me here, Brian?

26:45.979 --> 26:49.857
You know they're going
to capture Dom. Maybe worse.

26:51.568 --> 26:55.863
I don't want you getting tangled
up in this. So stay away from him.

26:56.781 --> 27:00.159
That's what you have to say to me
after five years?

27:01.536 --> 27:04.371
All of a sudden, you care
what happens to me.

27:07.709 --> 27:10.127
What l did to you was wrong.

27:10.211 --> 27:14.506
I'm sorry. lt was... lt was the
hardest thing l've ever had to do.

27:15.967 --> 27:17.885
I'm sorry, too, Brian.

27:18.511 --> 27:23.265
I'm so sorry that you had to come
into my home and pretend to love me.

27:23.350 --> 27:25.726
I'm so sorry that you ripped
my family apart.

27:25.810 --> 27:28.729
I'm very sorry that that was
hard for you.

27:32.442 --> 27:34.068
I lied to you.

27:35.528 --> 27:38.072
I lied to Dom.
I lied to everybody.

27:38.573 --> 27:41.825
That's what l do best.
It's why the Feds recruited me.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.871
Maybe you're lying to yourself.

27:47.123 --> 27:50.834
Maybe you're not the good guy
pretending to be a bad guy.

27:51.294 --> 27:54.672
Maybe you're the bad guy
pretending to be the good guy.

27:54.756 --> 27:56.924
You ever think about that?

27:58.551 --> 28:00.052
Every day.

28:12.440 --> 28:14.274
I always wondered,

28:16.486 --> 28:19.279
why did you let
my brother go that day?

28:20.782 --> 28:22.282
I don't know.

28:32.210 --> 28:33.627
Shit.

28:36.756 --> 28:37.756
Brian!

28:37.841 --> 28:40.843
I got the cross-checks on David Park
back and have a list of possibles.

28:40.969 --> 28:43.387
What do you got? All right. A 45-year-old
male in a '06 Scion

28:43.471 --> 28:45.556
with three reckless
driving tickets.
No.

28:45.640 --> 28:48.016
An '01 Chevy Tahoe.
No.

28:48.101 --> 28:51.937
Two Mini Coopers,
a '06 and a '07,
a Toyota hybrid.

28:52.021 --> 28:54.690
Hell no.
A '98 Saturn,
a '95 Sebring.

28:54.774 --> 28:56.900
A '98 Nissan 240

28:56.985 --> 28:58.986
Wait. That's it.

28:59.070 --> 29:01.572
What?
The 240 with
the illegal mod.

29:01.698 --> 29:04.950
How do you know?
'Cause that's something

29:29.392 --> 29:30.851
Don't! Don't! Don't!

29:42.489 --> 29:45.199
Green Torino, running nitro.

29:46.159 --> 29:47.826
Whose car?
I don't know, man.

29:47.911 --> 29:50.913

29:55.752 --> 29:57.461

That's all l can do!

30:04.803 --> 30:06.178
What race?

30:11.643 --> 30:13.393
Help! Come on,

30:13.478 --> 30:15.854

30:32.205 --> 30:33.205

30:33.248 --> 30:35.958
God! Don't drop me!
That's all l know!

30:37.043 --> 30:38.544

30:38.628 --> 30:41.129
You here to take

30:41.589 --> 30:44.132
Shit! Shit!
Shut up!

30:47.011 --> 30:48.720
Letty was my friend, too.

30:48.805 --> 30:50.430
You weren't anyone's friend.

30:50.515 --> 30:53.642
Yo, can you guys
talk about this later?
Now pull my ass up!

30:53.726 --> 30:56.019
She was running

30:56.104 --> 30:57.145
Please!

30:57.230 --> 30:59.857
I'm going to

30:59.941 --> 31:02.150
Now let me do my job

31:02.235 --> 31:04.695
I'm going to kill this Braga.

31:06.614 --> 31:07.823
God!

31:08.241 --> 31:10.993
And anyone else

31:38.646 --> 31:40.564
That's enough!
</font>
Don't touch me.

31:40.648 --> 31:42.065
I'm fine!
</font> That's enough.

31:42.150 --> 31:45.360
You're through, O'Conner!
I said that's enough!

31:46.863 --> 31:48.405
Stasiak, go get
yourself cleaned up.

31:48.489 --> 31:50.741
What?
He hit me first! You...

31:50.825 --> 31:52.826
This isn't the Cub Scouts!

31:52.911 --> 31:56.163
Now, go on!
You're bleeding on my floor.

32:05.757 --> 32:08.592
O'Conner, do you know the difference
between a cop and a criminal?

32:08.676 --> 32:11.094
What?
One bad judgment call.

32:12.597 --> 32:14.765
Keep your shit in line, son.

32:18.728 --> 32:20.479
Have a good time.

32:23.483 --> 32:25.150
Take a seat.

32:29.072 --> 32:33.700
Good news. We have intel that Braga's
number two, Ramon Campos,

32:33.785 --> 32:35.953
will hold a street race
in Koreatown tomorrow night

32:36.037 --> 32:38.205
to fill a slot on his team.

32:38.748 --> 32:41.416
They've already chosen three drivers
from previous races.

32:42.919 --> 32:45.045
Our newest informant,
Mr. David Park,

32:45.129 --> 32:47.881
has been kind enough
to get us into the race.

32:50.385 --> 32:52.594
O'Conner, you're up.

32:53.429 --> 32:56.014
Let me guess,
winner gets the slot.

33:01.562 --> 33:04.314
All right, so these are
all the imports the city has in impound.

33:04.399 --> 33:06.525
Okay, nice.
Pick your poison.

33:06.609 --> 33:09.820
All right, 2206.
I crashed one of those.

33:09.904 --> 33:14.574
341 8 and 2765.

33:15.910 --> 33:17.869
Okay, so which one do you want?

33:17.954 --> 33:19.663
I want them all.

33:49.652 --> 33:51.445
Standard issue tracking device.

33:51.529 --> 33:53.447
Boss wants to know
where you are at all times.

34:45.958 --> 34:47.167
You want to play with it?

34:48.168 --> 34:49.293
</font> Hey!

34:49.670 --> 34:52.089
<font color="#D900D9">What are you
looking at, nutsack?

34:52.172 --> 34:53.924
I don't know.
You tell me.

34:54.007 --> 34:56.259
The racer wants
what Dwight's got.

34:56.344 --> 34:59.304
See, but, ladies,
Dwight's already on the team.

34:59.388 --> 35:01.348
You got to be fast
if you want to drive for Braga.

35:01.432 --> 35:04.267
Is there
a problem here?
No.

35:06.771 --> 35:08.772
You one of Park's guys, blondie?

35:08.856 --> 35:10.357
Yeah. Yeah, l am.

35:11.109 --> 35:12.567
Follow me.

35:15.905 --> 35:17.697
<font color="#D900D9">See you later, punk.

35:18.491 --> 35:19.699
You, too, punk.

35:32.046 --> 35:34.214
</font> Bull's-eye, coño,
come on!

35:40.263 --> 35:41.471
</font> We can do this all day.

35:46.686 --> 35:49.020
You all know why you're here.

35:49.689 --> 35:51.189
Good drivers

35:52.859 --> 35:54.651
are a dime a dozen.

35:55.069 --> 35:59.364
Man, every corner's
got a chingadera tuner
racing for pinks.

36:00.199 --> 36:03.201
That's not what Braga
has got me looking for.

36:03.786 --> 36:08.456
Braga wants someone that
would sell their abuelita
to be behind the wheel.

36:10.042 --> 36:14.129
Someone that drives
their 1 0-second cars
not in a straight line,

36:14.213 --> 36:18.425
but to push it and
make it through places
no one else would take it.

36:19.135 --> 36:20.719
Real drivers.

36:22.847 --> 36:24.931
So, what are we hauling?

36:25.933 --> 36:29.352
</font> For the money
Braga's paying,
you don't need to know.

36:29.437 --> 36:32.105
You just said
you wanted
real drivers.

36:34.025 --> 36:37.277
A real driver knows
exactly what's in his car.

36:42.325 --> 36:44.117
Mira, real driver,

36:45.995 --> 36:48.205
nobody's forcing you to race.

36:48.289 --> 36:50.040
You the boss?

36:51.792 --> 36:54.085
Or am l talking to the boss?

36:57.048 --> 36:58.965
Do l look like a boss?

37:01.177 --> 37:04.721
My job is to find
the best drivers,
period.

37:04.805 --> 37:08.475
Whoever wins the race
gets the info. We cool?

37:13.397 --> 37:14.940
Are we cool?

37:17.151 --> 37:18.818
Yeah, we're cool.

37:19.320 --> 37:21.321
No, we ain't cool, man.

37:22.031 --> 37:24.199
Who's closing these streets?

37:26.494 --> 37:28.578
No one.
That's the point.

37:40.508 --> 37:43.718
</font>Please wait while

37:49.475 --> 37:51.935

38:05.074 --> 38:08.368
You sure
you want to do this?
A lot has changed.

38:09.328 --> 38:11.162
Four...
You're right.

38:11.998 --> 38:13.206
Three,

38:14.750 --> 38:15.917

go!

38:29.515 --> 38:31.224
Right turn ahead.

38:34.562 --> 38:37.731
You are now five miles
from your destination.

39:03.758 --> 39:05.592
How's my ass look, Chia Pet?

39:06.427 --> 39:07.969
Ghetto Smurf.

39:33.079 --> 39:34.788
Dead man driving.

39:38.417 --> 39:39.709
Come on!

39:41.003 --> 39:42.796
Right turn ahead.

40:01.774 --> 40:02.941
Shit!

40:08.239 --> 40:09.531
Damn.

40:09.615 --> 40:17.615
Rerouting.

40:28.092 --> 40:30.260
Proceed straight ahead.

40:34.557 --> 40:35.932
Rerouting.

40:45.734 --> 40:46.943
Shit.

40:48.404 --> 40:50.613
Rerouting.
Just shut up!

40:54.410 --> 40:57.829
You are 2.6 miles
from destination.

41:00.708 --> 41:02.417
Oops, l didn't see you.

41:04.879 --> 41:08.882
You are now four
and one-half miles
from your destination.

41:41.582 --> 41:44.459
U-turn, if possible.
Are you kidding me?

41:44.543 --> 41:48.588
You are now 4.2 miles
from your destination.

41:50.424 --> 41:51.841
Sorry, car.

41:59.141 --> 42:01.643
You are now one mile
from your destination.

42:01.727 --> 42:03.937
Yeah, guess who's back, Dom?

42:06.857 --> 42:08.191
Let's go!

42:12.655 --> 42:14.280
Nice car, baby!

42:58.951 --> 43:00.159
Bitch!

43:01.495 --> 43:04.581
You are now
one-quarter mile
from your destination.

43:23.225 --> 43:24.851
Too early, Dom.

43:44.079 --> 43:45.121
No!

43:45.706 --> 43:47.498
Still a buster.

43:50.919 --> 43:54.047
You have reached
your destination.
Goodbye.

44:06.226 --> 44:09.103
At least we know
you can't beat me
straight up.

44:09.188 --> 44:10.980
I didn't know
there were any rules.

44:12.941 --> 44:14.651
Now that's what l call
real driving.

44:14.735 --> 44:16.110
No, that's bullshit, man!

44:16.195 --> 44:18.154
Go cry to your mama, eh?

44:20.574 --> 44:22.575
You work for Braga now.

44:22.993 --> 44:25.787
When the GPS calls, you follow.

44:30.793 --> 44:32.585
Driver's license.

44:32.670 --> 44:35.254
What driver's license?

44:35.798 --> 44:37.340
Thumb.

44:42.012 --> 44:43.805
Cell phone number.

44:48.894 --> 44:51.104
The print is for Campos.

44:51.772 --> 44:53.648
The number is for me.

44:57.111 --> 44:58.486
Yo, nutsack!

44:58.570 --> 45:02.156
Let me tell you
something, man, muscle
beats import every time.

45:02.241 --> 45:05.034
You know what
l'm saying?
Every time!

45:05.911 --> 45:08.955
Ladies, let's get on
back to Papa Dwight's.

45:15.587 --> 45:18.631
</font> Papa Dwight wants you
to take off your shoes.

45:19.299 --> 45:22.260
Dwight likes feet.
Take off your shoes.

45:23.178 --> 45:24.721
So beautiful.

45:26.849 --> 45:28.850
Dwight likes this foot a lot.

45:37.151 --> 45:38.568
Yes, baby!

45:39.737 --> 45:41.946
- Daddy Dwight loves...
</font>- FBl!

45:43.824 --> 45:46.868

Dwight didn't do nothing!

45:46.994 --> 45:49.454
Hey, no! Stay, stay!
Where you going?
</font> Bye, Dwight!

45:49.538 --> 45:50.747
No, what did l do?

45:51.957 --> 45:54.041
</font> You're under arrest
for distribution of meth.

45:54.126 --> 45:57.462
Meth? Dwight's never
touched that shit, bro!

45:57.546 --> 45:58.588
Dwight has now.

45:58.672 --> 46:01.048
Yo, that ain't mine! No!

46:01.133 --> 46:03.259
You know that's never
gonna stick, right?

46:03.343 --> 46:05.595
Yeah, it's not supposed to.

46:08.348 --> 46:10.266
Live it up!
Live it up!

47:05.739 --> 47:07.240
Yeah, Corona.

47:10.244 --> 47:11.619
That's too bad about Dwight.

47:11.703 --> 47:15.164
Having the Feds raid your house
the same night you make the team.

47:15.249 --> 47:17.250
So unfortunate.

47:17.334 --> 47:20.753
I wish l could say
l was surprised to see you here.

47:22.339 --> 47:25.591
What's to stop someone
from telling them you're a cop?

47:25.676 --> 47:29.428
Probably the same thing that's keeping me
from telling them why you're really here.

47:29.513 --> 47:31.722
What up, fellows?
Hey, how you doing?

47:31.807 --> 47:34.475
Great. You having a good time?
Yeah, a great time.

47:34.560 --> 47:37.103
Come on,
let's have a better time.

47:37.646 --> 47:41.190
How's your car?
It took a nasty bump.

47:41.275 --> 47:42.817
</font> lt'll be ready.

47:42.901 --> 47:46.237
I also heard you just
got out of County.

47:46.321 --> 47:47.905
Yeah.
Mmm-hmm.

47:48.240 --> 47:49.991
You know a guy named Jim Garcia?

47:50.075 --> 47:54.120
Nah. Big place.
Lots of names, lots of faces.

47:55.622 --> 47:58.666
And you, you're wanted by
a lot of people, homes.

47:58.750 --> 48:01.335
Yeah, that kind of heat
can't be good for business.

48:01.420 --> 48:04.338
Yeah, well, that depends
on how you look at things.

48:04.423 --> 48:06.799
I go down, l do time.

48:07.843 --> 48:09.510
I do real time.

48:10.554 --> 48:15.099
I don't know about your other drivers, but
when l see flashing lights in my mirror,

48:15.183 --> 48:16.684
l don't stop.

48:22.065 --> 48:24.066
Do you know each other?

48:28.155 --> 48:30.323
He used to date my sister.

48:31.408 --> 48:32.742
I see.

48:35.162 --> 48:37.705
You're a lucky man.
How's that?

48:38.749 --> 48:40.750
You're still breathing.

48:46.798 --> 48:50.843
To the ladies we've loved
and the ladies we've lost.

48:59.561 --> 49:01.604
So, what's Braga about?

49:03.523 --> 49:05.399
You know, he's just one of us.

49:05.484 --> 49:08.945
Came up from the streets.
Down for el barrio.

49:09.029 --> 49:11.238
Now he's a shot caller.

49:12.074 --> 49:13.950
The boss of bosses.

49:14.576 --> 49:16.869
See all these cats in here?

49:17.454 --> 49:20.122
Any one of them
would die for Braga.

49:20.207 --> 49:21.832
Including you?

49:23.961 --> 49:25.586
Especially me.

49:35.389 --> 49:37.139
Enjoy the party, fellows.
Club's yours.

49:37.224 --> 49:40.476
Whatever you want,
booze, broads, it's all good.

49:43.897 --> 49:45.439
Braga's mine.

49:49.027 --> 49:51.404
I'm taking the whole house down.

49:52.197 --> 49:53.572
Good luck.

52:01.368 --> 52:04.078
Something interests you
about this car?

52:04.704 --> 52:06.956
Just admiring the body work.

52:08.542 --> 52:12.545
Are you one of those boys
who prefers cars to women?

52:16.007 --> 52:20.719
I'm one of those boys that appreciates
a fine body, regardless of the make.

52:24.391 --> 52:25.850
Your car?

52:29.896 --> 52:31.564
It's Fenix's car.

52:32.774 --> 52:36.861
You'll meet him at the rendezvous.
He'll be leading you.

52:38.363 --> 52:39.738
So now

52:41.158 --> 52:43.534
that l know your taste in cars,

52:43.618 --> 52:46.162
tell me, what about your women?

52:48.165 --> 52:50.332
It all starts with the eyes.

52:52.836 --> 52:58.007
She's got to have those kind of eyes
that can look right through the bullshit

52:58.091 --> 53:00.217
to the good in someone.

53:04.848 --> 53:08.017
20% angel, 80% devil.

53:09.686 --> 53:11.520
Down to earth.

53:13.356 --> 53:17.526
Ain't afraid to get a little engine grease
under her fingernails.

53:24.492 --> 53:27.119
That doesn't sound
anything like me.

53:29.789 --> 53:31.123
It ain't.

53:39.216 --> 53:40.216
Hi.
Hi.

53:40.300 --> 53:43.385
I got a gift for you.
All right.

53:43.470 --> 53:46.013
A dirty shot glass,
just what l always wanted.

53:46.097 --> 53:47.681
I got these
from the club last night.

53:47.766 --> 53:49.725
There's two sets
of prints here. Run them both.

53:49.809 --> 53:53.312
I know one of these is Campos'. l think
the other might be Braga's.

53:53.396 --> 53:55.940
And you're gonna have
to go beyond lnterpol.

53:56.024 --> 53:58.400
So, that means l have to contact
individual agencies,

53:58.485 --> 54:01.028
and that could
take weeks. Okay.

54:16.127 --> 54:17.127
Yeah.

54:17.170 --> 54:20.339
That's your third traffic violation in
less than three blocks.

54:20.423 --> 54:22.424
Slow it down, O'Conner.

54:23.093 --> 54:24.802
Sure thing, Dad.

54:53.873 --> 54:54.957
He stopped.

55:49.596 --> 55:51.013
We lost him.

55:51.097 --> 55:52.700
He killed the tracker.
We don't know that.

55:52.724 --> 55:54.994
I'm telling you, he killed the tracker.
We don't know that yet!

55:55.018 --> 55:56.935
Get the bird overhead.

55:58.063 --> 56:01.106
</font> Right now,
I'm moving north, 33', 56'...

56:29.427 --> 56:31.720
</font>Base, flag nine, I'm at Angels 5.

56:31.805 --> 56:35.432
I don't have a tally on the target. Repeat,
I don't have a tally on the target.

56:35.517 --> 56:37.226
They're gone,
there's no one down there.

56:37.310 --> 56:38.644
Damn it!

56:49.697 --> 56:54.493
</font> This ain't right, bro. Nobody said
nothing about being locked in no truck.

56:54.577 --> 56:56.328
Tell me about it.

56:59.082 --> 57:00.833
Hey. Hey!

57:02.544 --> 57:05.587
Yo!
Where do you think they're taking us?

57:05.672 --> 57:07.256
Don't matter.

57:10.176 --> 57:13.011
We're all just along
for the ride now.

57:24.107 --> 57:26.108
Welcome to Mexico, boys.

57:31.865 --> 57:34.241
There are helicopters
and surveillance cameras

57:34.325 --> 57:36.785
that scan for heat
signatures at the border.

57:36.870 --> 57:40.831
But there are blind spots that l can
guide you through via satellite.

57:40.915 --> 57:45.419
There can be no margin of error, so
you must follow my every direction.

57:46.129 --> 57:47.504
Any questions?

57:49.549 --> 57:52.092
I thought Fenix
was gonna be here.

57:55.263 --> 57:57.347
He'll meet you out there.

58:02.228 --> 58:04.563
All right, everybody, sync up.

58:07.358 --> 58:09.234
Good luck, gentlemen.

58:22.665 --> 58:24.249
</font>Satellite linkup engaged.

58:25.585 --> 58:28.629
Keep proceeding northbound
at current speed.

58:32.592 --> 58:34.468
Stay close to Fenix.

58:35.637 --> 58:37.095
He'II lead you across.

58:51.277 --> 58:54.821
I got a heat signature northbound
along Legardo Ravine.

58:57.283 --> 59:01.828
Thermal imaging window on the Mexico
side's gonna be down for about 45 seconds.

59:01.913 --> 59:03.789
Get the camera on it.

59:03.873 --> 59:07.709
</font> Manual override. Rerouting
camera to designated coordinates.

59:10.880 --> 59:13.674
</font> Hurry it up.
You guys have been tagged.

59:23.476 --> 59:24.810
Shit.

59:25.979 --> 59:28.397
Toretto, get back in formation.

59:31.568 --> 59:32.651
Reimaging commencing.

59:41.452 --> 59:43.370
I don't see anything.

59:43.454 --> 59:44.663
They're gone.

59:46.708 --> 59:48.667
Get the helicopters to cover it.

59:52.755 --> 59:55.882
</font> Base,
we're 40 seconds out from Legardo Ravine.

59:56.759 --> 59:58.385
</font> They're sending a helicopter.

01:00:00.013 --> 01:00:01.888
You have 30 seconds.

01:00:10.690 --> 01:00:13.817
</font> North 32' 33', west 1 1 6' 49'.

01:00:20.325 --> 01:00:22.117
</font> The window is closing fast.

01:00:22.201 --> 01:00:25.370
You need to get out of there before
they send ground support.

01:00:31.586 --> 01:00:33.253
Fifteen seconds.

01:00:38.718 --> 01:00:41.053
</font> Base, target is at two miles.

01:00:54.233 --> 01:00:56.443
</font> You're running out of time.

01:00:59.489 --> 01:01:01.573
You need to get out now!

01:01:13.544 --> 01:01:17.547
</font> Base,
we're at north 32' 33', west 1 1 6' 49'.

01:01:17.632 --> 01:01:21.510
We have no visual contact.
Roll ground units for confirmation.

01:01:42.448 --> 01:01:43.782
Sloppy!

01:01:44.450 --> 01:01:45.992
Very sloppy!

01:01:51.624 --> 01:01:53.667
What are you doing, man?

01:01:56.170 --> 01:01:57.504
Come on.

01:02:00.633 --> 01:02:01.967
Get out.

01:02:05.430 --> 01:02:06.680
Come on, man.

01:02:06.764 --> 01:02:08.724
Come on, today, man.
Come on, let's go.

01:02:08.808 --> 01:02:10.688
</font> Hey, don't touch me.
Hey, don't touch me, man!

01:02:12.061 --> 01:02:13.770
Hey, l said don't touch me, man!

01:02:13.855 --> 01:02:15.457
Hey, look, dawg,
don't put your hands on me.

01:02:15.481 --> 01:02:16.982
</font> Hey, Malik, chill, bro.

01:02:17.108 --> 01:02:18.377
Yo, man, what's up
with your boy?

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:20.277
</font> Hey, boss man!

01:02:23.197 --> 01:02:24.906
What did you say?

01:02:24.991 --> 01:02:28.744
I said only pussies
run nitrometh.

01:02:31.372 --> 01:02:33.457
You looked under my hood?

01:02:40.339 --> 01:02:42.048
I'm talking to you.

01:02:42.133 --> 01:02:44.342
Got something on your mind?

01:02:45.178 --> 01:02:46.511
'70 Plymouth.

01:02:49.515 --> 01:02:50.807
Her name was Letty.

01:02:53.936 --> 01:02:55.020
Yo.

01:02:56.564 --> 01:02:58.315
Where's my money?

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:02.360
</font> And somebody wrecked her car.

01:03:10.161 --> 01:03:11.411
I wrecked her car.

01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:17.042
You remember her face?

01:03:22.799 --> 01:03:23.799
Huh?

01:03:24.675 --> 01:03:26.301
'Cause l don't.

01:03:27.678 --> 01:03:30.347
Last time l saw it,
it was burning.

01:03:44.153 --> 01:03:45.529
Now what?

01:03:47.156 --> 01:03:49.908
I'm going to enjoy
what happens next.

01:04:23.985 --> 01:04:25.485
Dom, get in!

01:04:26.779 --> 01:04:28.446
Get in! Come on!

01:04:30.449 --> 01:04:34.286
Come on! Get in the fucking car!
Let's go! Hurry up!

01:05:01.272 --> 01:05:02.898
</font> What have you got, Trinh?

01:05:02.982 --> 01:05:05.567
We're contacting agencies
in multiple countries.

01:05:05.651 --> 01:05:10.655
Unfortunately, most of them have to manually
scan their prints for us to upload.

01:05:11.490 --> 01:05:13.575
O'Conner's on line five.

01:05:13.659 --> 01:05:15.744
And, sir, you should see this.

01:05:15.828 --> 01:05:17.329
Thank you.

01:05:27.715 --> 01:05:28.840
Talk to me, O'Conner.

01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:31.468
Where the hell have you been?
I got the shipment.

01:05:31.552 --> 01:05:34.554
"l got the shipment,"
or "we got the shipment"?

01:05:34.639 --> 01:05:36.681
What are you talking about?

01:05:36.766 --> 01:05:41.227
Traffic cams in the area picked up
pictures of you and Toretto together.

01:05:42.355 --> 01:05:47.108
Listen to me, O'Conner.
Bring in the shipment and bring in Toretto.

01:05:47.526 --> 01:05:50.246
But l thought the point was to get Braga.
We got an opportunity here.

01:05:50.279 --> 01:05:52.864
Brian, the clock
stopped ticking.

01:05:53.741 --> 01:05:56.034
Bring them in.
Are we clear?

01:06:00.373 --> 01:06:01.706
O'Conner?

01:06:11.717 --> 01:06:14.552
So this is what
$60 million looks like.

01:06:16.305 --> 01:06:18.932
Yeah, we got to
get you to a doctor.

01:06:19.016 --> 01:06:21.685
We got to find
a place to hide this.

01:06:24.271 --> 01:06:25.438
I got a spot.

01:06:35.533 --> 01:06:38.451
502, wet reckless.
I need a 48-hour hold.

01:06:40.579 --> 01:06:42.414
Out back.
Any spot you can find.

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:49.462
You sure about this?

01:06:50.423 --> 01:06:56.594
Yeah. The last place they'll check,
their own impound yard. Trust me.

01:07:03.102 --> 01:07:04.978
You know, l've been thinking,

01:07:05.062 --> 01:07:07.522
when you blew up your car back there,
you blew up mine, too.

01:07:07.606 --> 01:07:10.108
Yeah?
Yeah.

01:07:10.192 --> 01:07:12.777
So now you owe me
a 1 0-second car.

01:07:14.113 --> 01:07:16.364
Is that right?
Yeah.

01:07:27.626 --> 01:07:29.335
Now we're even.

01:07:45.019 --> 01:07:47.896
Is this your way of keeping me
away from him?

01:07:48.022 --> 01:07:51.858
You're the only one
l could call.
He's my brother, of course.

01:07:59.492 --> 01:08:01.576
The bullet's not in there.

01:08:09.126 --> 01:08:13.088
I'm gonna clean it and stitch it up.
It's going to hurt.

01:08:13.172 --> 01:08:15.632
I bet you're going
to enjoy this.

01:08:16.300 --> 01:08:17.634
A little.

01:08:20.595 --> 01:08:23.014
</font>- Want some of this?
</font>- Yeah.

01:08:23.099 --> 01:08:25.140
</font> lt's spicy.

01:08:26.894 --> 01:08:28.520
I like it hot.

01:08:29.647 --> 01:08:31.856
Dom, what are you doing?

01:08:31.941 --> 01:08:34.859
You reached first,
you have to say grace.

01:08:45.162 --> 01:08:49.040
Thank you, Lord,
for blessing this table.

01:08:50.501 --> 01:08:55.255
With food, family
and friendship.

01:09:28.997 --> 01:09:31.332
You asked me why l let Dom go.

01:09:33.419 --> 01:09:36.087
I think it's because
at that moment,

01:09:37.798 --> 01:09:40.633
l respected him
more than l did myself.

01:09:45.014 --> 01:09:46.221
Yeah.

01:09:47.808 --> 01:09:52.937
One thing l learned from Dom is that nothing
really matters unless you have a code.

01:09:56.150 --> 01:09:58.443
And what's your code, Brian?

01:10:00.821 --> 01:10:02.614
I'm working on it.

01:10:37.483 --> 01:10:39.025
Shit. Hey, Dom.

01:10:39.151 --> 01:10:41.694
When were you gonna tell me?
Dom, what are you doing?

01:10:41.779 --> 01:10:43.779
When were you gonna tell me
you were running Letty?

01:10:43.822 --> 01:10:46.157
Let me explain...
When were you gonna...

01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:52.872
Dom, stop!

01:10:52.957 --> 01:10:55.124
You don't understand.
I don't understand?

01:10:55.209 --> 01:10:56.417
Stop!

01:11:00.589 --> 01:11:01.798
She did it for...

01:11:04.885 --> 01:11:06.427
</font> Dom, stop!

01:11:06.512 --> 01:11:08.638
Dom, stop it!
Please stop!

01:11:18.065 --> 01:11:21.693
She did it for you, Dom!
She did it for you!

01:11:26.198 --> 01:11:30.535
Letty came to me to clear your name
in exchange for bringing down Braga.

01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:36.082
She just wanted you
to come home!

01:11:53.267 --> 01:11:55.059
I'm sorry, Dom!

01:11:55.144 --> 01:11:56.561
I'm sorry!

01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:27.258
You better have one hell of an explanation.
You disobeyed a direct order.

01:12:28.135 --> 01:12:30.136
Where's the shipment?
It's safe.

01:12:30.220 --> 01:12:32.013
It's safe.

01:12:32.097 --> 01:12:34.974
Look, we could use the shipment to parade
in front of the media,

01:12:35.059 --> 01:12:37.019
get a few hundred pounds of heroin
off the street,

01:12:37.061 --> 01:12:40.772
but Braga's just gonna send another
shipment next week and the week after that.

01:12:40.856 --> 01:12:42.982
Let's use the shipment
to lure Braga out

01:12:43.067 --> 01:12:45.109
and lop the head off
a multi-billion dollar cartel.

01:12:45.194 --> 01:12:47.570
And how do you
suggest we do that?

01:12:47.654 --> 01:12:49.614
A hand-to-hand
exchange with Braga.

01:12:49.698 --> 01:12:51.074
He'll never show.

01:12:51.158 --> 01:12:52.950
He can't afford not to.

01:13:03.087 --> 01:13:04.754
You got a plan?

01:13:06.256 --> 01:13:07.924
There's a price.

01:13:10.803 --> 01:13:13.596
We bag Braga,
you let Toretto walk.

01:13:22.398 --> 01:13:24.607
Yes?
It's Dom.

01:13:25.651 --> 01:13:27.944
I was just thinking about you.

01:13:28.320 --> 01:13:32.240
You know, when l gave you my number,
l was hoping you'd call.

01:13:32.825 --> 01:13:35.368
But not under
these circumstances.

01:13:35.702 --> 01:13:38.830
What circumstances?
Me being alive?

01:13:39.873 --> 01:13:41.833
Don't take it personally.

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:44.252
It's just business.

01:13:44.336 --> 01:13:45.920
I got some business of my own.

01:13:47.214 --> 01:13:48.673
Get Campos.

01:13:51.176 --> 01:13:52.593
It's them.

01:13:56.932 --> 01:13:57.932
Uh-huh.

01:13:58.183 --> 01:14:02.186
Was that how Braga inspires loyalty?
Killing his drivers?

01:14:02.688 --> 01:14:05.022
One can always
find more drivers.

01:14:05.274 --> 01:14:07.275
It's just good business.

01:14:07.526 --> 01:14:08.776
I want to trade.

01:14:09.069 --> 01:14:11.112
Braga doesn't negotiate.

01:14:11.196 --> 01:14:12.196
Fine.

01:14:12.281 --> 01:14:17.160
You explain to him how all of a sudden
$60 million worth of product disappears.

01:14:17.870 --> 01:14:20.163
I know that can't
be good for business.

01:14:21.248 --> 01:14:22.790
What do you want?

01:14:23.292 --> 01:14:27.545
Six million cash,
delivered by Braga himself.

01:14:30.215 --> 01:14:31.841
I don't like being shot at.

01:14:32.217 --> 01:14:35.470
I ain't gonna put my neck out again
unless he's got something to lose, too.

01:14:35.554 --> 01:14:37.138
He'll never go for it.

01:14:37.222 --> 01:14:40.850
Either l deal with Braga,
or you do.

01:14:44.855 --> 01:14:46.397
When and where?

01:15:01.455 --> 01:15:05.374
Sir, players are onsite.
Holding positions at the perimeter.

01:15:05.834 --> 01:15:08.419
All right. Listen up.
Everybody stay frosty.

01:15:08.504 --> 01:15:11.172
We don't move a muscle until
O'Conner gives the signal.

01:15:11.256 --> 01:15:13.966
When he gets the money,
you know what to do.

01:15:14.551 --> 01:15:17.011
Well, the good news is,
when we get this guy,

01:15:17.095 --> 01:15:19.514
you walk out of here a free man.

01:15:19.890 --> 01:15:21.307
Is that what they told you?

01:15:21.391 --> 01:15:23.017
Yeah, that's the deal.

01:15:23.101 --> 01:15:26.521
You still put milk
and cookies out for Santa Claus?

01:15:27.814 --> 01:15:28.981
Yeah.

01:15:33.779 --> 01:15:34.862
Here.

01:15:34.947 --> 01:15:37.031
In case things go shitty.

01:15:41.995 --> 01:15:44.038
Just like old times?

01:15:44.122 --> 01:15:45.414
Yeah.

01:15:49.002 --> 01:15:50.294
You dropped something.

01:15:50.379 --> 01:15:52.547
That's what
you wanted, right?
Dom...

01:16:07.646 --> 01:16:10.273
He's harmless.
Don't worry about him.

01:16:12.025 --> 01:16:14.527
And he's really
sorry about Letty.

01:16:16.655 --> 01:16:18.447
Where's our stuff?

01:16:21.201 --> 01:16:24.495
You mean the stuff
that used to be
in here, right?

01:16:25.664 --> 01:16:29.458
Well, you'll see it
when we see Braga. That was the deal.

01:16:30.419 --> 01:16:31.836
No worries.

01:16:32.212 --> 01:16:34.213
Braga keeps his word.

01:17:18.216 --> 01:17:19.717
$2 million.

01:17:20.802 --> 01:17:23.554
You get the rest
when l get my property.

01:17:27.893 --> 01:17:29.518
- Stasiak.
- We got a match.

01:17:29.603 --> 01:17:31.646
The fingerprint's Braga's 1 00%.

01:17:31.730 --> 01:17:34.190
Just waiting on
facial confirmation via fax.

01:17:34.274 --> 01:17:36.233
</font> I got a question for you.

01:17:36.318 --> 01:17:40.071
You wearing pink when you were clawing
your way out of el barrio?

01:17:41.323 --> 01:17:42.782
Order all agents to move in.

01:17:42.866 --> 01:17:45.993
We got confirmation.
Primary suspect wearing gray suit.

01:17:46.078 --> 01:17:47.078
Let's move.

01:17:47.162 --> 01:17:49.080
Sir, O'Conner hasn't
given us the signal yet.

01:17:49.164 --> 01:17:52.500
What part of that didn't you understand?
We just got confirmation. Do it!

01:17:52.584 --> 01:17:55.920
</font>Secure primary suspect in gray suit.
Repeat!

01:17:56.004 --> 01:17:58.589
Secure primary suspect
in gray suit.

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:14.772
You're thinking
what l'm thinking, right?

01:18:17.567 --> 01:18:19.193
He ain't Braga.

01:18:23.782 --> 01:18:24.782
Oh, shit.

01:18:24.950 --> 01:18:27.201
</font></font>Drop your weapons!
</font> FBl!

01:18:27.619 --> 01:18:28.911
Get down!

01:18:32.416 --> 01:18:34.125
Get out of here!

01:18:38.213 --> 01:18:40.089
Get out of here, Dom!

01:18:44.386 --> 01:18:45.970
Run him down.

01:18:46.471 --> 01:18:47.680
Go!

01:18:48.348 --> 01:18:50.015
Campos is Braga!

01:18:57.482 --> 01:18:58.774
Come on.

01:19:06.158 --> 01:19:08.284
</font>Approaching primary target.

01:19:08.827 --> 01:19:10.995
</font>Primary suspect is secure.

01:19:13.665 --> 01:19:15.458
</font>He was under your nose the whole time.

01:19:16.001 --> 01:19:17.752
Now Braga's escaped.

01:19:17.836 --> 01:19:20.796
Toretto's heading south,
probably long across the border by now.

01:19:20.881 --> 01:19:23.151
Do you have any idea
the kind of trouble you're in, O'Conner?

01:19:23.175 --> 01:19:25.134
I was doing my job.

01:19:25.218 --> 01:19:27.762
He ain't the first bad guy
you helped escape the law's grasp.

01:19:27.846 --> 01:19:29.805
As of now,
you're being taken off active duty,

01:19:29.890 --> 01:19:32.850
until this house can
mount a formal inquiry.

01:19:35.020 --> 01:19:36.771
What about Braga?

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:40.191
That's no longer your concern.

01:19:50.577 --> 01:19:52.077
We now know where Braga is,
right?

01:19:52.162 --> 01:19:55.623
Customs tracked him via satellite
to his home base in Tecali, Mexico.

01:19:55.707 --> 01:19:58.125
Mexico is out
of our jurisdiction.

01:20:00.921 --> 01:20:02.505
The fact is

01:20:02.589 --> 01:20:06.675
the brass will be so busy
holding press conferences over the seizure,

01:20:06.760 --> 01:20:08.886
we'll skate under the radar.

01:20:09.346 --> 01:20:12.389
I thought we signed on
to do the right thing.

01:20:50.762 --> 01:20:52.888
Everyone's looking for you.

01:20:53.265 --> 01:20:54.890
I'm right here.

01:20:56.184 --> 01:20:57.578
It's nice to see
you've gone with the times

01:20:57.602 --> 01:21:01.188
and switched to electronic fuel injection.
Looks good.

01:21:02.315 --> 01:21:04.400
Buster became a gearhead.

01:21:08.488 --> 01:21:10.281
I'm going with you.

01:21:14.202 --> 01:21:16.871
I don't plan on
bringing anyone back.

01:21:18.832 --> 01:21:20.165
I know.

01:21:28.925 --> 01:21:30.593
Hit that throttle.

01:21:56.870 --> 01:21:57.995
Hey.

01:22:39.788 --> 01:22:42.790
How do you say goodbye
to your only brother?

01:22:44.960 --> 01:22:46.377
You don't.

01:23:55.280 --> 01:23:57.656
I thought you weren't
gonna show up.

01:23:57.741 --> 01:23:59.366
You saved my life.

01:24:00.243 --> 01:24:02.703
I'm willing to return the favor.

01:24:06.583 --> 01:24:09.084
This will help get you to Braga.

01:24:13.298 --> 01:24:14.381
Dom.

01:24:15.383 --> 01:24:18.010
Going in there is suicide.

01:24:26.561 --> 01:24:28.312
I have no choice.

01:24:31.900 --> 01:24:34.359
You must have
loved her very much.

01:24:52.420 --> 01:24:55.130
So this is where
my jurisdiction ends.

01:25:00.929 --> 01:25:03.097
And this is where mine begins.

01:27:13.478 --> 01:27:15.354
You ain't forgiven.

01:27:18.816 --> 01:27:20.984
You boys want to arrest me?

01:27:24.030 --> 01:27:26.073
No, we're beyond that.

01:27:27.158 --> 01:27:29.952
You can't buy
your way out of this one.

01:27:31.329 --> 01:27:32.996
You and me...

01:27:34.207 --> 01:27:37.042
You and me,
we're not so different.

01:27:38.795 --> 01:27:40.379
You're no hero.

01:27:51.015 --> 01:27:52.683
You're right.

01:27:55.812 --> 01:27:59.147
And that's why you're going back
across the border.

01:28:05.154 --> 01:28:06.863
But Fenix is mine.

01:28:07.865 --> 01:28:08.949
You got it.

01:28:31.222 --> 01:28:32.347
Shit!

01:28:37.395 --> 01:28:40.939
You'll make it
a couple of miles out,
if you're lucky.

01:29:33.493 --> 01:29:35.744
You know where you're going?

01:29:36.788 --> 01:29:38.955
You want to borrow my GPS?

01:29:42.668 --> 01:29:44.378
Where are your boys at?

01:29:44.462 --> 01:29:46.004
Are they going
to show up or what?

01:29:49.467 --> 01:29:51.510
Careful what you ask for.

01:30:07.819 --> 01:30:10.028
Just stop.
Just stop the car.

01:30:30.216 --> 01:30:31.925
Right behind you.

01:30:46.774 --> 01:30:49.860
Dom, head to the tunnel.
Let's use the tunnel.

01:31:17.096 --> 01:31:19.055
Get out of here, Brian.

01:31:26.814 --> 01:31:30.317
You sure you know
where the tunnels are? You sure?

01:31:30.860 --> 01:31:32.611
Yeah. l'd hold on.

01:31:35.698 --> 01:31:37.365
This might hurt.

01:31:50.755 --> 01:31:52.923
You're in my world now, baby!

01:32:21.536 --> 01:32:24.079
That's it, baby!
End of the road.

01:32:24.163 --> 01:32:25.622
Now what?

01:32:26.415 --> 01:32:27.499
Game over.

01:32:27.583 --> 01:32:29.125
No, no, no.

01:32:58.739 --> 01:33:00.156
Come on!

01:34:19.362 --> 01:34:20.445
</font> Hey!

01:34:21.572 --> 01:34:23.406
Get me out of here!

01:35:53.539 --> 01:35:54.956
Pussy.

01:36:12.349 --> 01:36:13.975
Let me see that.

01:36:16.520 --> 01:36:18.897
Yeah.
Just keep pressure there.

01:36:19.565 --> 01:36:21.566
<font color="#D900D9">You'll be all right.

01:36:27.448 --> 01:36:29.532
You gotta get out of here.

01:36:32.161 --> 01:36:34.162
I ain't running anymore.

01:36:39.794 --> 01:36:41.878
I gotta ask you something.

01:36:42.546 --> 01:36:43.671
Yeah?

01:36:44.423 --> 01:36:48.468
You know l would have won that race
if you didn't cheat, right?

01:36:51.555 --> 01:36:53.473
You hit your head hard.

01:36:58.354 --> 01:37:00.230
Don't make me laugh.

01:37:10.908 --> 01:37:12.283
All rise.

01:37:17.581 --> 01:37:19.290
Please be seated.

01:37:23.546 --> 01:37:25.588
Please rise,
Mr. Toretto.

01:37:27.967 --> 01:37:30.260
L've listened to the testimony

01:37:30.761 --> 01:37:32.887
and taken into
special consideration

01:37:32.972 --> 01:37:36.975
Agent O'Conner's appeal of clemency on
behalf of Mr. Toretto.

01:37:37.935 --> 01:37:40.603
That his actions directly resulted
in the apprehension

01:37:40.688 --> 01:37:43.523
of known drug
trafficker Arturo Braga.

01:37:45.067 --> 01:37:46.442
However,

01:37:47.736 --> 01:37:49.696
this judiciary finds that

01:37:49.780 --> 01:37:54.617
one right does not make up for a lifetime
worth of wrongs.

01:37:55.286 --> 01:37:57.036
And as such,

01:37:57.121 --> 01:38:02.125
l find that l am forced to level the
maximum sentence under California law.

01:38:04.545 --> 01:38:06.212
Dominic Toretto,

01:38:07.047 --> 01:38:11.050
you are hereby
sentenced to serve 25 years to life

01:38:11.135 --> 01:38:14.220
at the Lompoc maximum security
prison system

01:38:14.972 --> 01:38:17.765
without the possibility
of early parole.

01:38:18.350 --> 01:38:20.184
This court is adjourned.
