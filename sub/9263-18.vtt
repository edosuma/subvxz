10:51.484 --> 10:52.652
Stop, please.

10:52.694 --> 10:54.320
What?

10:54.362 --> 10:56.072
I'm gonna need you
to shut up.

10:56.114 --> 10:57.407
Okay.

10:57.448 --> 10:58.658
'Cause I'm incredibly
hung over right now.

10:58.700 --> 10:59.659
What is that?

10:59.701 --> 11:01.661
You need to go home.

11:01.703 --> 11:03.413
Okay?

11:03.454 --> 11:05.456
Thank you.

Let's go!

11:18.136 --> 11:19.179
Concentrate, concentrate.

11:19.220 --> 11:21.306
Where are you going, Street?
Let's go!

11:22.640 --> 11:23.725
Let's go!

11:25.727 --> 11:28.688
What you guys doin'?

Oh, good Lord,

Shut up.

Bye.

11:55.215 --> 11:56.507
Jackass.

12:00.553 --> 12:02.222
Hi.

12:02.263 --> 12:04.557
"Hi?"

12:04.599 --> 12:06.559
I drove 200 miles,
and all I get is "hi?"

12:06.601 --> 12:08.603
I'm just shocked
to see you.

12:10.230 --> 12:12.732
Surprised.

12:12.732 --> 12:13.733
Happy?

12:13.733 --> 12:16.653
Happy is a much
better word.

12:16.694 --> 12:18.738
Baby, what's wrong?

12:18.738 --> 12:22.075
What is it?

12:22.075 --> 12:24.035
I think my parents
are splitting up.

12:32.710 --> 12:33.920
You know, I'm gonna be
a Panther someday.

12:33.962 --> 12:35.088
Good luck with that, Bo.

12:35.088 --> 12:36.923
Watch this!

12:43.471 --> 12:44.931
He pumps it.
He throws it.

It's going, it's going!

12:46.266 --> 12:47.350
It's tipped!

12:47.392 --> 12:49.727
Oh! It's caught
in the end zone!

12:49.769 --> 12:51.729
What do you say
about that, Riggins?

12:51.771 --> 12:54.565
Hey, hand me the ball.

12:59.237 --> 13:01.114
I'm gonna teach you
how to spiral, all right?

13:01.155 --> 13:02.198
Oh, boy.

13:02.240 --> 13:03.157
Okay.

13:03.199 --> 13:06.035
I want you to put
your fingers over the lace,

13:06.077 --> 13:07.370
like that, okay?

13:07.412 --> 13:09.122
As big as your hands are,

13:09.163 --> 13:10.665
you just do the best
you can, okay?
Got it.

13:10.707 --> 13:12.292
And when you pull
the ball back,

13:12.333 --> 13:14.961
you wanna turn your body.

13:14.961 --> 13:16.296
So you can put
what little weight you have

13:16.296 --> 13:17.380
behind the ball.

13:17.422 --> 13:18.464
Got it.
Uh‐huh.

13:18.464 --> 13:22.427
And when you throw it,
I want you to follow through.

13:22.468 --> 13:24.762
Okay, now let me try!

13:24.804 --> 13:26.973
Ready!
Candy, candy, candy!

13:26.973 --> 13:27.932
Hut!

13:31.811 --> 13:33.479
Not too shabby.

13:35.273 --> 13:38.985
Don't you think your Mom
will just get over it?

13:38.985 --> 13:41.112
I don't know.

13:41.154 --> 13:45.158
I don't‐‐
I don't know that she should.

There's no weakness
in forgiveness.

13:51.414 --> 13:53.458
You seem really happy.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.004
I am.
It's this sport.

13:58.046 --> 14:00.048
I don't know,
just playing something again.

14:04.343 --> 14:06.679
It's awesome.

14:06.679 --> 14:08.306
Just, uh...

14:08.347 --> 14:11.768
I don't think I've been
this happy since the accident.

14:14.187 --> 14:16.481
So...

14:16.522 --> 14:18.024
That came out wrong.

14:18.066 --> 14:19.317
That's okay.

14:19.358 --> 14:20.443
Baby, without‐‐
without you,

14:20.485 --> 14:21.652
I wouldn't even
be here right now.

14:21.694 --> 14:24.697
You make me
extremely happy, okay?

14:28.576 --> 14:30.161
What is that?

14:30.203 --> 14:31.496
What? What?

14:31.537 --> 14:33.164
What is this?
When did you get a‐‐

14:33.206 --> 14:34.582
You have a tattoo?

14:34.624 --> 14:35.833
[laughs]

14:35.875 --> 14:38.127
Is this real?

14:38.169 --> 14:39.712
Uh, yeah, um...

14:39.712 --> 14:41.714
It was an impulse buy,
and I was,

14:41.714 --> 14:43.174
I was definitely gonna
tell you about it.

14:43.216 --> 14:45.551
You are permanently
messed up!

14:45.593 --> 14:48.304
I was pretty permanently
messed up before.

14:48.346 --> 14:50.139
It's not a big deal.

14:50.181 --> 14:53.059
It kind of is.

14:53.101 --> 14:55.561
Okay, maybe it's, uh,
a little...

14:55.603 --> 14:56.646
What does it say?

14:56.687 --> 14:59.065
tiny bit
of a big deal.

14:59.065 --> 15:03.194
It, uh, it says "peace."

15:03.236 --> 15:04.862
And it's, uh,
it's Sanskrit.

15:04.904 --> 15:07.198
Peace.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.075
Yeah.

How you doin', Bud?
Oh, I'm good, man.

15:29.220 --> 15:31.097
I, uh, hope you don't mind.

15:31.097 --> 15:32.765
I got the, uh,
game tapes out.

15:32.807 --> 15:34.267
No, that's fine,
that's fine.

15:34.267 --> 15:36.227
I'll be with you
in just a second then.

15:36.269 --> 15:37.270
Just hang on a second.
All right.

15:37.270 --> 15:38.437
Uh, hey.

15:38.437 --> 15:39.856
Can I talk to you
for a second?

15:39.897 --> 15:42.108
Mm‐hmm.

15:45.486 --> 15:47.572
Honey, he's driving me crazy.

15:47.613 --> 15:48.573
Shh.
You know what
he went and...

15:48.614 --> 15:51.117
He went and bought
a whole bag of groceries.

15:51.117 --> 15:52.785
I mean, he's making me
make pork chops.

15:52.827 --> 15:55.413
Relax.
Stop, relax, shh.

Neil Kenny,
the athletic director

15:58.207 --> 16:00.585
over at TMU,
called this afternoon.

16:00.626 --> 16:01.919
He and his wife

16:01.961 --> 16:04.213
would like to have dinner
with us this evening

16:04.255 --> 16:06.632
to talk about the future.

16:06.674 --> 16:08.634
The future?
Our future?

16:08.676 --> 16:11.220
You busy tonight?

16:11.262 --> 16:12.221
No, I think I'm fine.

16:12.263 --> 16:13.264
We'll say it's a date,
then?

16:13.306 --> 16:14.432
Mm‐hmm.

16:15.808 --> 16:18.144
Ohh, that's amazing.

16:18.144 --> 16:19.270
I'm so proud of you.

16:19.312 --> 16:20.605

Thanks, baby.

What are we gonna do
about Buddy?

Bo!

Will you come when I call?

What are you doing
over here?

16:27.195 --> 16:28.154
Not now, Mom.

16:28.154 --> 16:29.822
You promised me
that you'd stay in the house

16:29.864 --> 16:30.948
and do your homework
if I went shopping.

16:30.990 --> 16:32.617
Come on, honey.
I'm hanging out
with Tim Riggins.

16:32.658 --> 16:34.744

everything there is to know

16:34.785 --> 16:37.205
about the game of football.

16:37.205 --> 16:40.208

in just one afternoon.

Oh.

16:45.713 --> 16:46.797
This one.
Thanks.

16:46.839 --> 16:47.798
You bet.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.342
So, uh, Bo tells me

16:49.342 --> 16:50.509
y'all been hangin' out.

16:50.509 --> 16:52.178
Yeah, a little.

16:52.178 --> 16:53.971
A lot, actually.

16:54.013 --> 16:56.307
The only rule
was I had to keep my voice

16:56.349 --> 16:57.391
down to a level three.

16:57.433 --> 17:00.853
Because Tim Riggins had some
massive hangover thing.

17:00.895 --> 17:02.313
Oh.

17:02.355 --> 17:04.190
Good, that's great.
Come on.

17:04.232 --> 17:05.191
He's all yours.
Yeah.

17:05.233 --> 17:07.318
Can he come over
for dinner, Mom?

17:07.360 --> 17:08.653
Not now, honey.
Please, Mom.

17:08.694 --> 17:09.862
Please!

on my truck.

You can't finish it in the dark.

You know that.
Please?

If it's all right
with your mama, I guess.

Okay.

You little turkey,
come on now.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.210
Get in the house
and do your homework.

17:24.252 --> 17:26.337
What are we having?
I'll make it short.

17:26.379 --> 17:27.672
You little squirt.

17:27.713 --> 17:29.215
Sorry!

17:30.550 --> 17:31.300

17:31.342 --> 17:33.719
You are seriously
not expecting me

17:33.761 --> 17:35.555
to stay here alone
with Buddy Garrity.

17:35.555 --> 17:36.556
I mean, are you even
comprehending

17:36.597 --> 17:38.015
the depths
of awkwardness?

17:38.057 --> 17:39.350
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

17:39.392 --> 17:40.726
Why don't I just
stick pins in my eyes?

17:40.726 --> 17:42.311
Well, I think that's
a terrible idea.

17:42.353 --> 17:43.354
But listen to me.

17:43.396 --> 17:44.814
This is a very important
dinner.

17:44.855 --> 17:45.898
It's very important
to your father.

17:45.898 --> 17:47.233
It's important
for his career.

His career pays
for all those nice things

17:50.027 --> 17:51.404
that you like for him
to buy for you.

17:51.404 --> 17:52.905
You don't have to sit down
and have popcorn

17:52.905 --> 17:54.031
and watch movies with him.

17:54.073 --> 17:56.534
Mom...
Honey...stop it.

17:56.576 --> 17:59.912
Oh...so you're not
taking sides now, right?

17:59.954 --> 18:02.290
Okay, so I'm not allowed
to hang out with Tyra,

18:02.331 --> 18:03.291

the night alone with,

that's the way you see it.

your mother said.

You listen to her.

have you noticed anything
different about Waverly?

No, sir,
I can't say I have.

18:52.965 --> 18:55.635
Okay. I need to ask
a favor of you.

18:58.137 --> 19:00.806
If you notice anything
different about her,

I need for you
to let me know, okay?

Tyra's mom
had an accident, and...

28:07.227 --> 28:09.688
there's no adult
here to handle this.

28:09.688 --> 28:11.273
Well, honey,
what are you doing there?

28:11.315 --> 28:13.817
I was at a party
at her house.

28:13.859 --> 28:14.860
Julie...

28:14.902 --> 28:16.778
Look, Mom,
you can yell at me later.

28:16.820 --> 28:18.030
But can you just get here?

28:18.030 --> 28:19.656
Yeah, baby,
I'll be there.

28:19.698 --> 28:20.741
I'll be there.

28:24.703 --> 28:26.079
Thank you very much for...

28:26.121 --> 28:27.581
sitting through that.

28:27.623 --> 28:29.750
No, thanks for having me.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.834
It was great.

28:30.876 --> 28:32.628
He's a funny kid.

28:32.669 --> 28:35.213
I'm sure you've got
your hands full.

28:35.255 --> 28:38.216
Yeah.

28:38.258 --> 28:39.384
Bo, hurry up.

28:39.384 --> 28:40.719
The man's waiting.

28:40.719 --> 28:43.805
I almost got it!

28:44.932 --> 28:46.391
You know, uh...

28:46.391 --> 28:48.977
your rain gutter's
falling off, huh?

28:49.019 --> 28:50.729
Oh, yeah, heh.

28:50.771 --> 28:53.315
That's on my long list
of things to do.

28:53.357 --> 28:56.818
I've got, um, work and Bo,
and then homework.

28:56.860 --> 28:58.737
I just don't
really have time to do it.

28:58.779 --> 28:59.863
Yeah.
I'll get to it.

28:59.905 --> 29:00.656
Here it is!

29:00.697 --> 29:02.240
I thought you might
wanna have this.

29:02.240 --> 29:04.076
[sighs]

29:04.117 --> 29:05.744
Well, you
thought right.

29:05.744 --> 29:07.079
Yeah.

29:07.079 --> 29:08.789
Handsome.
It's fantastic.

29:08.789 --> 29:10.290
This is going
on the fridge.

29:10.290 --> 29:12.334
Yes!
I'll tell you that much.

29:12.376 --> 29:14.002
All right.
All right.

29:14.044 --> 29:15.837
Good night.

29:15.879 --> 29:17.673
Thanks again.
Yeah.

29:17.714 --> 29:20.092
(Bo)
Bye, Tim Riggins!

29:20.092 --> 29:21.176
Good night, Bo.

29:26.890 --> 29:28.767
You feeling okay?

29:28.809 --> 29:30.769
[scoffs]
I feel wonderful.

29:30.769 --> 29:33.105
Why are you asking me?
Why?

29:33.105 --> 29:35.440
Just seem
a little different lately.

29:35.440 --> 29:37.776
Just 'cause‐‐
'cause I'm alive?

29:37.776 --> 29:39.277
Because I'm feeling
the world?

29:39.319 --> 29:40.946
If that's different,

29:40.946 --> 29:42.447
then sign me up,
I'm different.

29:42.447 --> 29:44.408
I feel great.

29:47.786 --> 29:49.121
All right, it's like this.

29:49.121 --> 29:51.832
I was taking
some medication for a while,

29:51.832 --> 29:54.793
and...now I'm off of it.

29:54.793 --> 29:56.795
What kind of medication?

29:56.837 --> 30:00.966
It was like
this stuff for a mood disorder.

30:00.966 --> 30:03.927
But it's really no big deal.

30:03.969 --> 30:05.262
I'm better now, you know?

30:05.303 --> 30:07.097
I got it under control, I...

30:07.139 --> 30:09.808
I don't need drugs
to keep me straight.

30:12.310 --> 30:14.312
Does your dad know
you stopped taking them?

30:14.354 --> 30:16.773
Uh, do you know
who my dad is?

30:16.815 --> 30:18.775
You've seen him
in the pulpit.

30:18.817 --> 30:20.152
Sweatin', words.

30:20.193 --> 30:21.403
He do be sweatin'.

30:21.445 --> 30:22.821
Ooh, he do be sweatin'.

30:22.821 --> 30:24.906
No, he's just‐‐
he doesn't get it.

30:24.948 --> 30:27.492
You know, I mean,
it's my body.

30:27.492 --> 30:29.494
I can do whatever
I want with it, you know?

30:29.494 --> 30:30.996
Things are good,
it's like,

30:31.038 --> 30:33.206
how do you feel
when you're out on the field?

30:33.206 --> 30:36.001
I feel...

30:36.001 --> 30:37.002
alive.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.837
Alive!
Exactly.

30:38.837 --> 30:39.838
That's what
I'm talking about.

30:39.838 --> 30:42.340
That's how I feel.
Trust.

30:42.340 --> 30:46.011
I feel better
than I've ever felt.

30:46.011 --> 30:47.179
Okay.

30:47.179 --> 30:48.305
[both laugh]

30:48.346 --> 30:50.182
Okay.

30:50.182 --> 30:51.767
[giggles]

30:59.483 --> 31:01.318
I really think
I had a breakthrough

31:01.359 --> 31:03.320
with Tyra tonight.

31:03.361 --> 31:05.280
Landry...
you're retarded.

31:05.322 --> 31:06.782
(Tami)
Jules...

31:06.823 --> 31:08.867
Mom, I'm really sorry.
I don't want to talk about it
right here, right now.

31:08.867 --> 31:10.035
Okay, please?
How's Tyra's mom?

31:10.035 --> 31:11.870
I guess she's okay.
I don't know.

31:11.912 --> 31:13.413
They won't let us in.

31:13.413 --> 31:15.832
Will you do me a favor, please,
and take her home?

31:15.874 --> 31:16.875
But I wanna
stay here and help.

31:16.917 --> 31:18.794
I will make sure Tyra's mom
gets home safely.

31:18.835 --> 31:19.795
Can you do that, Matt?
Yes, ma'am.

31:19.836 --> 31:22.506
I want you home.

31:22.547 --> 31:24.841
Y'all drive safe.

31:24.883 --> 31:26.259
Yes‐‐yes, ma'am.

31:29.012 --> 31:32.891
Uh, can you get me
information on Angela Collette?

31:32.933 --> 31:34.434
Julie!

31:36.019 --> 31:38.980
Hey.
Julie didn't come home?

31:39.022 --> 31:41.399
Hey.

31:41.399 --> 31:43.443
So how's Neil Kenny doing?

31:46.404 --> 31:48.448
How the hell did you know
I went out with Neil Kenny?

31:49.407 --> 31:53.036
Note pad.

31:53.078 --> 31:55.622
It's a little something
I learned on Magnum, P.I.

31:55.622 --> 31:57.624
You gotta be kidding me.

31:57.624 --> 31:58.625
Worked pretty
dad gum well.

31:58.625 --> 31:59.751
You gotta be kidding me.

31:59.793 --> 32:02.045
So did he
offer you a job?

32:02.087 --> 32:03.255
[wadding paper up]

32:03.255 --> 32:04.881
No. No, no.

32:04.923 --> 32:06.258
Not officially, Buddy.

32:06.258 --> 32:07.259
No, not officially.

32:07.300 --> 32:08.426
You gonna take it?

32:08.426 --> 32:09.427
No, I'm not gonna
take it, Buddy,

32:09.469 --> 32:10.929
'cause it's not official.

32:10.929 --> 32:11.930
Okay, well,
when it's official,

32:11.972 --> 32:14.015
are you gonna take it?

32:14.057 --> 32:14.933
[chuckles]

32:14.975 --> 32:17.018
Are you?

32:17.060 --> 32:18.228
Gee, I don't know.

32:18.270 --> 32:20.105
I'll let you know
when the time comes, Buddy.

32:20.147 --> 32:22.190
Yeah, I might need to know.

32:22.232 --> 32:24.568
God.

32:28.280 --> 32:30.073
Do we need to talk?

32:34.244 --> 32:36.997
Do you love her?

32:36.997 --> 32:38.165
Do I what?
Do you love her?

32:38.206 --> 32:39.583
Love who?

32:39.624 --> 32:41.251
The cute tattoo girl,
Jason.

32:41.293 --> 32:42.294
[laughs]

32:42.294 --> 32:43.962
Are you serious right now?

32:43.962 --> 32:45.922
No, I don't love her.
You do love her.

32:45.964 --> 32:47.090
No, I don't love her.
It's okay, it's okay.

32:47.132 --> 32:48.967
No, I don't.
No, you can tell me.

32:48.967 --> 32:50.218
Lyla‐‐
Tell me, it's okay.

32:50.260 --> 32:52.053
I have never seen you
this wasted.

32:52.095 --> 32:54.055
I'm not wasted.
You're cracking me up.

32:54.097 --> 32:55.140
You are!
Do you love her?

32:55.140 --> 32:56.433
No, I don't.

32:56.474 --> 32:58.935
[laughs]
You're funny
when you're drunk.

32:58.977 --> 33:00.312
It's not funny, Jason,

33:00.312 --> 33:02.564
when you drive
all the way from Dillon,

33:02.606 --> 33:04.566
and you find your boyfriend
hanging out

33:04.608 --> 33:05.984
with people
that scare you.

33:05.984 --> 33:08.987
And getting tattoos
from sexy girls.

33:08.987 --> 33:10.113
It's not funny.

33:11.156 --> 33:13.575
It's not funny, Jason.

33:13.617 --> 33:16.161
It's not funny.

33:16.161 --> 33:18.038
[crying]
You're changing,

33:18.038 --> 33:19.497
and it is so real.

33:19.539 --> 33:21.041
And I'm not changing
with you.

33:21.041 --> 33:23.293
We're never gonna last,

33:23.335 --> 33:26.338
because I'm not
changing with you.

33:26.338 --> 33:29.633
Well, I'm sorry, I...

33:29.674 --> 33:32.052
Lyla...

33:35.972 --> 33:37.015
I'm sorry.

33:37.057 --> 33:37.974
It's okay.
No, it's okay.

33:38.016 --> 33:41.019
It's okay, it's okay,
because you know what?

33:41.019 --> 33:42.103
It's bigger than us.

33:42.145 --> 33:43.355
Nothing is bigger
than us, Lyla!

33:43.355 --> 33:45.523
Nothing is bigger than us.

33:45.523 --> 33:50.111
Nothing is bigger than the love
I have for you in my heart.

33:50.153 --> 33:51.696
Nothing is bigger than that.

33:51.696 --> 33:53.031
And I'm not
holding on to you anymore

33:53.031 --> 33:54.366
because you're
all I have left.

33:54.366 --> 33:56.368
I'm holding on to you
because I love you.

33:56.368 --> 33:58.370
And I need you in my life.

33:58.411 --> 34:01.081
And I'm not giving you up
without a fight.

34:01.122 --> 34:04.709
I am not letting you go.

34:04.709 --> 34:07.420
[crying]
I love you.

34:22.727 --> 34:24.688
(Tami)
I brought you some water.

34:27.357 --> 34:29.067
Thank you
for doing all this.

34:29.067 --> 34:31.069
You're welcome.

34:31.069 --> 34:32.570
Take care of yourself,
all right?

34:32.570 --> 34:34.072
Thank you.

35:05.103 --> 35:06.187
[clears throat]

35:09.274 --> 35:10.692
Thanks for helping me
bring my mama home.

35:10.734 --> 35:11.943
You're welcome.

35:11.985 --> 35:12.819
You can go home now.

35:12.861 --> 35:14.613
You don't have to help me
clean up.

35:14.613 --> 35:16.698
Well, I think somebody's gonna
have to help you here, hon.

35:16.740 --> 35:18.241
Well, it's not
gonna be you.

35:20.285 --> 35:22.120
Yeah, actually, I think
right now it is gonna be me.

35:22.120 --> 35:24.289
You know, why don't you
quit pretending

35:24.331 --> 35:25.123
like you actually
give a damn

35:25.165 --> 35:27.334
about what happens
to me or my family?

35:27.375 --> 35:29.044
I do give a damn.
Please.

35:29.085 --> 35:31.212
I found out tonight you won't
even let Julie hang out with me.

35:31.254 --> 35:33.632
Like I'm some kind
of virus.

35:33.632 --> 35:35.216
So it's a little annoying
when you come into my house

35:35.258 --> 35:37.093
and try to act superior,
start cleaning up

35:37.135 --> 35:39.220
like you're some kind
of friend of the family.

35:39.262 --> 35:40.138
'Cause you are not.

35:40.138 --> 35:40.805
[crying]
So you know what?

35:40.805 --> 35:42.307
You just‐‐you go take

35:42.349 --> 35:43.308
your precious little daughter,

35:43.350 --> 35:46.227
and you lock her away,
so bad people like me,

35:46.269 --> 35:47.771
we can't hurt her.
Honey...

35:47.812 --> 35:50.315
Just go home!

35:54.527 --> 35:56.029
Tyra...

36:04.496 --> 36:08.166
It's just that...

36:08.208 --> 36:09.250
Julie's my girl.

36:09.292 --> 36:13.171
[scraping plate]

36:13.171 --> 36:15.507
And she's never
behaved like this before.

36:15.507 --> 36:17.300
And I might have been
blaming you for that.

36:17.342 --> 36:17.926
I mean, you know,
it could be

36:17.967 --> 36:21.137
that she's
just growing up.

36:21.179 --> 36:22.430
And I thought

36:22.472 --> 36:24.182
that I would be
prepared for all that,

36:24.182 --> 36:26.351
'cause I'm her mother,
and I thought I would...

36:26.351 --> 36:28.687
be prepared for whatever
came down the way.

36:28.687 --> 36:31.690
And...boy,
I'll tell you what.

36:31.690 --> 36:33.191
It feels like
a big ol' freight train

36:33.191 --> 36:36.194
just headin' right
in my direction.

36:36.236 --> 36:38.196
And I can't do a thing
to stop it.

36:38.196 --> 36:39.531
But I'm just trying.

36:39.572 --> 36:45.286
I'm just trying
my hardest to stop it.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.622
So I'm sorry, Tyra.

36:50.583 --> 36:51.543
Thank you.

36:51.543 --> 36:54.212
[clears throat]

36:54.549 --> 36:55.408
I'll get the broom.

37:06.558 --> 37:08.893
(Taylor)
Hey.

37:08.893 --> 37:11.229
What are you doing?

37:11.229 --> 37:13.982
Oh, I guess I'll go hide out
in some hotel.

37:14.023 --> 37:15.650
Maybe nobody'll see me.

37:22.073 --> 37:23.158
Okay.

37:23.199 --> 37:25.076
Eric, I just don't think
it's very cool

37:25.076 --> 37:27.078
for you to be meeting
with TMU

37:27.078 --> 37:28.913
while I'm living
right under your roof.

37:28.913 --> 37:32.083
I mean, do you care
anything about the Panthers?

37:32.125 --> 37:33.752
Can I ask you a question?

37:33.752 --> 37:35.587
How can you even
think about that stuff

37:35.587 --> 37:37.088
when you're in the mess
that you are with your wife?

37:37.088 --> 37:38.673
Really.

37:38.715 --> 37:39.758
Pam will forgive me.

37:39.758 --> 37:40.925
You think?

37:40.925 --> 37:43.553
You know what I think?

37:43.595 --> 37:44.679
I think you hide your head
in football

37:44.721 --> 37:45.764
a little too much, Buddy.

37:45.805 --> 37:46.848
'Cause I don't think
you should care about the semis.

37:46.890 --> 37:48.933
I don't think
you should care about

37:48.933 --> 37:50.059
who I'm having dinner with,

37:50.101 --> 37:52.771
or who the hell is even
coaching the team.

37:52.771 --> 37:56.065
I think you need
to worry about your family.

37:57.275 --> 37:59.569
I think you need to worry
about your family, man.

38:04.574 --> 38:06.117
You know what, Eric?

38:06.117 --> 38:08.203
I'll always care
about the Panthers.

38:08.244 --> 38:10.163
Pam can cut off my head

38:10.163 --> 38:13.124
and stick it on a spike
in the front yard.

38:13.166 --> 38:14.751
But I'll always care.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.836
Always.

38:21.299 --> 38:23.968
All right,
I think that's it.

38:23.968 --> 38:27.138
Yeah.

38:27.138 --> 38:29.974
Will you call me if there's
anything your mom needs?

38:29.974 --> 38:31.851
Yeah.
Okay.

38:37.106 --> 38:38.983
And you know what, Tyra?

38:38.983 --> 38:39.901
Hmm?

38:39.943 --> 38:42.654
Why don't you come on by
my office on Monday?

38:42.654 --> 38:46.032
I'd like to talk to you
about your academic future.

38:47.992 --> 38:49.994
What am I,
your next project?

38:49.994 --> 38:52.956
Absolutely.

38:52.997 --> 38:54.958
[scoffs]

38:54.999 --> 38:56.209
Take care of yourself,
sweetheart.

39:01.631 --> 39:02.674
Mrs. T?

39:02.674 --> 39:05.051
Yeah?

39:06.678 --> 39:08.012
Thank you.

39:08.012 --> 39:10.098
You're welcome.

39:18.356 --> 39:23.111
[cell phone vibrating]

39:28.700 --> 39:30.660
Hey, baby.

39:30.702 --> 39:32.036
Dad's at church all day.

39:32.036 --> 39:34.247
You wanna come baby‐sit?

39:34.247 --> 39:35.331
[chuckles]

39:35.373 --> 39:36.749
Give me two minutes.

39:36.749 --> 39:38.668
Okay.

39:45.842 --> 39:47.051
Victory.

39:47.051 --> 39:49.178
[giggles]

39:58.062 --> 40:01.024
You know what?

40:03.735 --> 40:06.070
This is all
gonna work out.

40:06.070 --> 40:07.655
You'll see.

40:09.407 --> 40:10.909
Watch.

40:10.909 --> 40:13.202
After I make this team,

40:13.244 --> 40:14.746
we'll go
on a little vacation.

40:14.746 --> 40:17.415
We'll go to Beijing
for the Paralympics.

40:23.046 --> 40:24.088
You'll see.

40:24.088 --> 40:25.840
Do you trust me?

40:25.882 --> 40:27.800
Hmm?

40:31.220 --> 40:32.388
[knock on door]

41:21.813 --> 41:23.481
[knock on door]

41:23.481 --> 41:26.985
[knocking]

41:26.985 --> 41:28.069
Waverly?

41:29.988 --> 41:31.280
Wavy.

41:33.282 --> 41:35.243
Wavy?

41:36.995 --> 41:38.371
Waverly.

41:41.374 --> 41:42.458
Wavy?

41:46.004 --> 41:47.380
Waverly?

41:56.347 --> 41:58.808
Hey.
What's wrong?

42:09.193 --> 42:10.486
Hey.

42:13.197 --> 42:14.782
Mm, thank you.

42:14.824 --> 42:16.034
Uh‐huh.

42:16.034 --> 42:18.536
[sniffs]

42:18.536 --> 42:21.247
I got the call.

42:21.247 --> 42:24.917
The call?

42:24.917 --> 42:27.170
TMU made the offer.

42:32.550 --> 42:33.801
Wow.

42:35.553 --> 42:37.346
Yep.

42:37.388 --> 42:40.066
