01:01.186 --> 01:04.053
THREE, FOUR HOURS
AT THE MOST.

01:04.147 --> 01:06.184
ANY IDEA HOW MANY?

01:06.275 --> 01:09.734
MY GUESS IS IF GENERAL OUSTER'S
REALLY LOOKING FOR THE SIOUX,

01:09.820 --> 01:13.108
HE'S GONNA HA\/E HIS BRITOHES FULL
OF 'EM BEFORE THE SUN GOES DOVVN.

01:13.198 --> 01:15.235
IS THAT THE JUNCTION
OVER THERE?

01:15.284 --> 01:18.367
BIGHORN AND THE LITTLE BIGHORN.
THAT'S VVHERE THEY CONVERGE.

01:18.453 --> 01:21.241

01:32.092 --> 01:34.424
WE CAN GO ON BACK AND
TELL YOUR GENERAL CUSTER

OTHER THAN THE FACT THAT YOU
READ A MAP UPSIDE DOVVN

02:21.600 --> 02:24.342
AND, UH, COULDN'T NAVIGATE
A PLOVV ACROSS A BALLROOM,

02:24.436 --> 02:26.552
WE THINK YOU'VE GOT
A LOT OF POTENTIAL.

02:37.658 --> 02:41.993
IT'S A VVIGVVAM. AN
HONEST-TO-PETE VVIGVVAM.

02:42.079 --> 02:44.320
OH, THERE'S A MILLION
MEN IN NATIONAL GUARD,

02:44.373 --> 02:46.660
BUT IT'S JUST MY LUCK
TO RIDE AROUND IN A TANK

02:46.750 --> 02:49.082
WITH THE LAST OF THE
RED-HOT EAGLE SCOUTS.

02:49.169 --> 02:51.501
YOU'RE RIGHT, MCCLUSKEY,
THAT'S A WIGWAM.

02:51.546 --> 02:53.537
NOW, WHY DOES THAT
MAKE YOU SO HAPPY?

02:53.632 --> 02:55.418
WELL, IT'S INTERESTING.

02:57.803 --> 03:01.592
RIGHT OVER THERE'S THE JUNCTION OF THE
BIGHORN AND LITTLE BIGHORN RIVERS.

03:01.682 --> 03:04.014
NOT FAR FROM THERE
IS WHERE CUSTER FOUGHT.

03:04.101 --> 03:07.344
YEAH, CUSTER?
CUSTER WHO?

03:07.396 --> 03:12.015
GENERAL CUSTER. THAT'S VVHERE THE 7TH

DO YOU FIGURE, SARGE?

03:35.549 --> 03:37.961
WELL, I FIGURE IT'S
IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE,

03:38.051 --> 03:42.045
CONSIDERING IT'S BEEN LAYING AROUND HERE
FOR ABOUT 8O YEARS, VVOULDN'T YOU SAY?

03:42.139 --> 03:45.882
YOU KNOVV, THERE MUST BE A LOT OF GHOSTS
RUNNING AROUND A PLACE LIKE THIS.

03:45.934 --> 03:47.971
OH, YEAH, GHOSTS,
SURE, MM-HM.

03:48.061 --> 03:50.223
YEAH, MCCLUSKEY'S
GOT IT RIGHT.

03:50.313 --> 03:53.556
SOMEVVHERE ALONG THIS RIVER THEY
FOUGHT A PRETTY BIG BATTLE.

03:53.608 --> 03:58.227
CUSTER AND ZOO-ODD MEN AGAINST
2,000 SIOUX, PROBABLY.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.905
YEAH, CUSTER'S LAST STAND. DIDN'T
YOU EVER HEAR OF IT, LANGSFORD?

04:01.992 --> 04:05.986
L-I HEARD OF IT, MCCLUSKEY.
I HEARD OF IT.

04:06.079 --> 04:08.366
WHY DON'T YOU BOYS
GET YOU A JOB IN A MUSEUM?

04:08.457 --> 04:12.075
MAYBE THEY'D SEND YOU OUT HERE ON AN
EXPEDITION AND PICK UP SOME ANTIQUES.

04:12.169 --> 04:15.161
I THOUGHT THIS VVAS SUPPOSED TO
BE A MOTORIZED PATROL, SARGE,

04:15.255 --> 04:18.964
AND I THOUGHT THAT VVE VVERE SUPPOSED
TO BE INVOLVED IN SOME VVAR GAMES.

04:19.050 --> 04:22.293
PERSONALLY, I DON'T CARE. I'D JUST
AS SOON BE OUT RECONNOITERING

DON'T YOU VVANT TO HANG AROUND AND
VVAIT FOR THE UNION OAVALRY, HUH?

04:54.252 --> 04:57.210
SO, THIS IS VVHERE THEY FOUGHT, HUH, SARGE?
RIGHT AROUND HERE?

04:57.297 --> 04:59.709
YEAH, YEAH, IT WAS
AROUND HERE SOMEPLACE.

04:59.800 --> 05:03.964
YOU KNOVV, VVHEN I VVAS A KID, I READ ABOUT
EVERYTHING THAT VVAS E\/ER VVRITTEN ON IT.

05:04.012 --> 05:07.630

05:07.682 --> 05:10.344
<i>THE LAST THING ANYBODY
EVER HEARD FROM CUSTER</i>

05:10.435 --> 05:13.473
<i>WAS THAT HE WAS DIVIDING HIS

HE VVAS PLANNING ON SURROUNDING VVHAT HE
THOUGHT VVAS A SMALL BUNCH OF INDIANS.

05:18.610 --> 05:22.478
AND, UH, SEE, CAPTAIN BENTEEN TOOK
THREE TROOPS AND HE VVENT SOUTH.

05:22.572 --> 05:26.315
AND MAJOR RENO, HE CROSSED THE RIVER
AND HE FOLLOVVED AN INDIAN TRAIL.

05:26.368 --> 05:28.860
AND CUSTER WENT
RIGHT UP THE MIDDLE,

05:28.954 --> 05:32.413
AND RODE RIGHT INTO 'EM
AND HE WAS SLAUGHTERED.

05:32.499 --> 05:37.244
1876. THAT
WAS THE YEAR.

05:37.337 --> 05:41.831
AH, NOVV, COME ON, NOVV, SARGE. SOMEBODY
PLANTED THIS THING AROUND HERE FOR A GAG-

05:41.883 --> 05:45.342
THAT CANTEEN'S
NOT 8O YEARS OLD.

05:45.428 --> 05:47.339

08:05.026 --> 08:07.142
HOW NICE OF YOU

<i>I'M SORRY, SIR, BUT WE HEARD SOME RIFLE FIRE

INDIANS, VVILL YOU TAKE IT VERY SLOVV?

BECAUSE THEY'RE ALL
COLLEGE GRADUATES

RUNNING TESTS ON THE SOIL.

12:16.319 --> 12:18.526

WITHOUT A RIDER.

12:18.613 --> 12:23.323
I KILLED HIM. SERGEANT, I JUST FIRED
BLIND INTO THAT DUST CLOUD, BUT-

12:25.954 --> 12:29.492
ALL RIGHT, LANGSFORD, YOU, UH,
YOU GOT SOMETHING TO SAY,

I DON'T KNOVV. I DON'T
KNOVV FOR SURE.

12:43.471 --> 12:47.465

SOMEHOW, SOME WAY,

WE'RE FOLLOWING THE SAME
TRAIL THAT CUSTER DID.

12:51.396 --> 12:55.139
