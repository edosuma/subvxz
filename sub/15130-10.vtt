WEBVTT

00:01.335 --> 00:04.236
Look. There are his feet
and there's his head.

00:04.238 --> 00:05.738
They're exactly where they
should be for 22 weeks.

00:05.740 --> 00:07.606
Two babies.
Gonna be a handful.

00:07.608 --> 00:09.208
Two handfuls, actually.

00:09.210 --> 00:10.209
(beeps)

00:10.211 --> 00:11.510
Okay.

00:11.512 --> 00:13.679
Now it's time
to leave the good stuff.

00:13.681 --> 00:15.614
You've been having increased
pain and vomiting?

00:15.616 --> 00:17.783
Yeah. This morning
I could barely stand up.

00:17.785 --> 00:19.451
All right. Let's have
a look at the tumor.

00:19.453 --> 00:22.087
(heartbeats continue)

00:22.089 --> 00:25.090
Tumor is mid-sigmoid.

00:25.092 --> 00:27.059
(beeps)

00:27.061 --> 00:29.094
Proximal sigmoid looks free.

00:29.096 --> 00:30.095
(beeps)

00:30.097 --> 00:32.531
The trick is to get it out
without disturbing the uterus.

00:32.533 --> 00:33.599
But we can do it.

00:33.601 --> 00:35.234
(exhales)
(hearts beating)

00:35.236 --> 00:37.336
You're enjoying that sound.
(laughs)

00:37.338 --> 00:38.470
Yeah, I'm addicted.

00:38.472 --> 00:40.172
Dr. Kalfas hooks me up
every time.

00:40.174 --> 00:44.209
Sorry I'm late and sweaty.
The game went extra innings.

00:44.211 --> 00:46.478
Hey. You are--
you must be the lucky dad.

00:46.480 --> 00:47.780
(carrie) he's my doctor.

00:47.782 --> 00:49.481
Jason kalfas.
Maggie lin.

00:49.483 --> 00:53.318
No way. Baseball jersey
threw me off.

00:53.320 --> 00:55.287
Can we talk for a sec?
Yeah.

00:55.289 --> 00:57.189
Okay.

00:57.191 --> 00:59.224
(indistinct conversations)

00:59.226 --> 01:01.427
It's a clean cancer,
but it's still cancer.

01:01.429 --> 01:03.462
The tumor's grown significantly
in the last two weeks,

01:03.464 --> 01:05.631
And she's starting to show signs
of bowel obstruction.

01:05.633 --> 01:08.067
We can deliver those babies
in less than two months.

01:08.069 --> 01:09.068
Are you sure we can't wait?

01:09.070 --> 01:11.370
Since this is
an emergency procedure,

01:11.372 --> 01:12.638
I can get an o.R. In an hour.

01:12.640 --> 01:16.675
Normally, I'd do an extensive
node-clearing excision.

01:16.677 --> 01:18.777
But in this case, our objective
is get the tumor out

01:18.779 --> 01:20.279
And take a limited resection.

01:20.281 --> 01:21.380
In and out
as fast as possible?

01:21.382 --> 01:25.818
Sure. You might want to hit
the showers first, jeter.

01:29.823 --> 01:31.457
Okay. You didn't
find that weird?

01:31.459 --> 01:33.826
He is
an obstetrician/gynecologist.

01:33.828 --> 01:35.227
What woman would want

01:35.229 --> 01:36.361
A drop-dead gorgeous man
like that

01:36.363 --> 01:37.529
Staring between her legs?

01:39.566 --> 01:41.300
You know what I mean.

01:41.302 --> 01:45.504
Could you talk to dr. Kalfas
about carrie's prenatal history?

01:45.506 --> 01:47.106
Charlie and I are supposed
to have a quick lunch.

01:47.108 --> 01:49.374
Sure. Leave me alone
with the good-looking o.B.

01:49.376 --> 01:50.709
See if I care.

01:53.413 --> 01:56.548
â™ª

01:56.550 --> 02:00.152
-- Captions by vitac --

02:00.154 --> 02:02.221
(alex) we only have
a half an hour.

02:02.223 --> 02:05.257
So, what were you guys
talking about this morning?

02:05.259 --> 02:06.258
Who?

02:06.260 --> 02:07.593
Get out of here.
(woman) sorry.

02:07.595 --> 02:09.828
Um... Uh... Does...

02:09.830 --> 02:13.265
You were very secretive when
I walked in on you this morning.

02:13.267 --> 02:15.167
It was nothing. Um...

02:15.169 --> 02:17.603
We'll talk about that later.

02:17.605 --> 02:19.905
(both moaning)

02:19.907 --> 02:21.273
Aah.

02:23.576 --> 02:24.776
What's wrong?

02:24.778 --> 02:28.547
Um, nothing. I just...
I remembered something.

02:28.549 --> 02:30.649
What did you remember?

02:30.651 --> 02:31.850
Nothing.

02:33.386 --> 02:35.320
That always seems to be
an answer with you lately.

02:35.322 --> 02:37.589
Well, some things
you don't want to know.

02:37.591 --> 02:38.824
If luke's in trouble,
I need to know.

02:38.826 --> 02:40.292
I didn't say
he was in trouble.

02:40.294 --> 02:42.928
I said that...
Well, what is it?

02:42.930 --> 02:44.429
Come on. We only got
a couple minutes.

02:44.431 --> 02:45.497
Let's just...
No, no, no, no.

02:45.499 --> 02:46.899
Not until you tell me.

02:46.901 --> 02:49.401
(exhales)

02:49.403 --> 02:50.536
I handed him
his jacket this morning,

02:50.538 --> 02:52.571
And a bottle of pills fell out.

02:52.573 --> 02:53.639
What kind of pills?

02:53.641 --> 02:54.673
It was vicodin.

02:54.675 --> 02:55.841
He said they weren't his,
but...

02:55.843 --> 02:58.343
Alex, he's already
scared enough of me as it is.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.344
Why don't you just wait
a couple days,

02:59.346 --> 03:03.182
Yeah, right. Come on, luke.
Answer the phone.

03:03.184 --> 03:04.950
Weren't we in the middle
of something fun here?

03:04.952 --> 03:06.885
The fun has coded.

03:07.820 --> 03:09.288
You pissed?

03:09.290 --> 03:10.789
You think?

03:10.791 --> 03:13.325
You're pissed.

03:13.327 --> 03:15.227
(police radio chatter)

03:15.229 --> 03:19.398
Luke! You should wait
for the cops!

03:19.400 --> 03:22.501
(luke) hey.
(cell phone ringing)

03:22.503 --> 03:24.503
You gotta talk to me, man.
You gotta tell me your name.

03:24.505 --> 03:25.871
Craig.

03:25.873 --> 03:27.439
(rings)

03:27.441 --> 03:29.675
What's up, craig?
How you doing?

03:29.677 --> 03:31.310
(ringing continues)

03:31.312 --> 03:35.614
I don't know.
It's my... Sister.
(ringing stops)

03:35.616 --> 03:38.450
I'm gonna call her back.

03:38.452 --> 03:40.485
Luke, I thought you were working
your program,

03:40.487 --> 03:42.554
Which does not include carrying
around a bottle of downers.

03:42.556 --> 03:44.256
Did you think
he wouldn't tell me?

03:44.258 --> 03:45.557
I'm going to call
until you answer,

03:45.559 --> 03:47.559
And then I'm going to yell.

03:47.561 --> 03:51.997
(sniffles)
this job was it.

03:51.999 --> 03:54.433
It was all I had,
and then they canned me.

03:54.435 --> 03:56.501
Okay.

03:56.503 --> 03:58.303
Hey.

03:58.305 --> 04:01.607
Craig, who needs this job,
you know?

04:01.609 --> 04:03.442
Let me ask you something--

04:03.444 --> 04:06.511
Are you familiar with the,
uh, principles of ld50?

04:06.513 --> 04:08.880
No? Okay.
Well, I'm gonna tell you.

04:08.882 --> 04:10.616
Ld50 is a dose of a toxin

04:10.618 --> 04:12.584
That'll kill 50%
of a tested population.

04:12.586 --> 04:14.453
Now we're up, what,
40 feet?

04:14.455 --> 04:16.288
That's ld50 for a fall.

04:16.290 --> 04:18.890
Do you know what that means,
craig? Craig, that means

04:18.892 --> 04:22.294
You only have
a 50% chance of dying.

04:22.296 --> 04:23.528
Understand that?

04:23.530 --> 04:27.299
I'll take those odds.
You sure about that?

04:27.301 --> 04:28.967
Because if you don't die,
craig, do you know what happens?

04:28.969 --> 04:30.002
I'm gonna tell you.

04:30.004 --> 04:34.306
You're gonna break
your back, okay?

04:34.308 --> 04:36.775
I'm gonna go down there, I'm
gonna throw you on a stretcher,

04:36.777 --> 04:37.776
I'm gonna take you
to the hospital,

04:37.778 --> 04:39.578
And they're gonna
save you, craig.

04:39.580 --> 04:41.580
Just so you can spend
the rest of your life

04:41.582 --> 04:44.383
In a wheelchair,
sucking food through a straw.

04:44.385 --> 04:47.786
Is that what you want, craig?

04:47.788 --> 04:49.321
That's not what you want.

04:49.323 --> 04:51.923
You don't want that.

04:51.925 --> 04:53.558
Right?
(crying) I don't know...

04:53.560 --> 04:56.795
Okay. Okay.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.664
You're not high enough, pal.

04:58.666 --> 05:02.501
So let's go down.
Let's think about it.

05:02.503 --> 05:03.869
You might change your mind.

05:03.871 --> 05:05.904
And if you still
want to go for it,

05:05.906 --> 05:09.041
We can just find you
a higher spot, all right?

05:09.043 --> 05:10.442
You're not high enough.

05:10.444 --> 05:12.811
Come on.

05:12.813 --> 05:15.480
All right.
Yeah.

05:15.482 --> 05:18.550
All right. Good.
Go slow. Go slow.

05:18.552 --> 05:19.651
(shouts indistinctly)

05:32.732 --> 05:35.334
(men shouting indistinctly)

05:35.336 --> 05:38.737
(cell phone ringing)

05:38.739 --> 05:40.339
(gasps)

05:40.341 --> 05:43.508
(man) stay still.
(ringing continues)

05:43.510 --> 05:44.976
Okay. This is not funny, luke.

05:44.978 --> 05:49.348
I'll be out in a couple of
hours, so call me.

05:50.550 --> 05:53.018
(coughs)
don't move!

05:53.020 --> 05:54.720
(groans)

05:54.722 --> 05:56.455
Luke, don't move!

05:56.457 --> 05:58.890
Aah.

05:58.892 --> 06:00.892
Aah!

06:00.894 --> 06:03.929
(gasping)
(sirens wailing in distance)

06:14.006 --> 06:15.440
(luke) any vitals?
No, man, he's v.S.A.

06:15.442 --> 06:16.942
You gotta let me
dress your wound.

06:16.944 --> 06:19.010
(breathing heavily)
listen to me.

06:19.012 --> 06:21.480
I need a bone doctor.
It's a segmental fracture, okay?

06:21.482 --> 06:22.681
We gotta get you
stabilized first,

06:22.683 --> 06:24.583
And then we can discuss--
clayton, shut up!

06:24.585 --> 06:26.418
Look. This is my bone.

06:26.420 --> 06:27.486
What do you want me to do?

06:27.488 --> 06:28.754
I need you to call someone,
okay?

06:28.756 --> 06:30.088
Okay.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.758
Zach, you busy?
No, what's up?

06:32.760 --> 06:34.693
Let's move.
What's going on?

06:34.695 --> 06:36.161
Got a 40-foot fall.
Leg impalement.

06:36.163 --> 06:37.629
Fracture of the proximal femur.

06:37.631 --> 06:39.898
Multiple abrasions.
That's just for starters.

06:39.900 --> 06:42.701
And you know this how?
'cause I took the call.

06:42.703 --> 06:44.403
It's luke reid.

06:49.142 --> 06:50.942
There you are. I've been looking
for you. I need to talk.

06:50.944 --> 06:53.578
Uh, sorry. I got group session
in one minute.

06:53.580 --> 06:55.480
I gotta run.
Please? It's important.

06:55.482 --> 06:56.548
Come find me after?

06:56.550 --> 06:58.083
I'm feeling weird.
Okay.

07:00.653 --> 07:01.653
(rips)
hmm.

07:01.655 --> 07:02.754
You're eating your cup.

07:02.756 --> 07:03.889
(clacks)

07:03.891 --> 07:06.057
Oh, sorry.
I-I'm hungry, I guess.

07:06.059 --> 07:07.692
Oh. Maybe we should grab some
lunch after the surgery, then.

07:07.694 --> 07:10.028
Um, I... I have a boyfriend.

07:10.030 --> 07:11.630
No, I didn't mean it
that way.

07:11.632 --> 07:13.098
He's handsome, too...

07:13.100 --> 07:15.100
In a different way
than you.

07:15.102 --> 07:16.168
Okay.

07:20.072 --> 07:23.175
(monitor beeping steadily)

07:23.177 --> 07:27.179
Carrie. Hi. You ready?

07:27.181 --> 07:28.914
My babies
are gonna be okay, right?

07:28.916 --> 07:31.950
Yes. But during the surgery,
my priority will be you.

07:31.952 --> 07:33.919
I'm a 42-year-old
pregnant single woman

07:33.921 --> 07:35.454
With bowel cancer.

07:35.456 --> 07:37.222
Operable, garden-variety
bowel cancer.

07:37.224 --> 07:39.090
You're lucky.

07:39.092 --> 07:40.759
No, what I am is terrified.

07:40.761 --> 07:42.561
I'll be lucky if I come out of
this surgery

07:42.563 --> 07:44.896
With both babies,
and the cancer gone.

07:44.898 --> 07:47.032
And any other story
is a tragedy.

07:47.034 --> 07:49.034
This is
a straightforward procedure

07:49.036 --> 07:50.702
With a very high recovery rate.

07:50.704 --> 07:52.037
Hello.

07:52.039 --> 07:53.171
Dr. Kalfas.

07:53.173 --> 07:54.739
I'll be watching
from the gallery.

07:54.741 --> 07:56.241
If you need anything,
just shout, I'll fly in.

07:56.243 --> 07:58.577
Like superman.

07:59.779 --> 08:01.646
I'll see you
when you wake up.

08:01.648 --> 08:02.781
(door closes)

08:02.783 --> 08:04.115
We'll scrub in.

08:05.751 --> 08:07.686
(chuckles softly)

08:11.757 --> 08:13.058
Maggie.

08:14.093 --> 08:17.596
(police radio chatter,
men shouting indistinctly)

08:17.598 --> 08:19.898
(siren whoops)

08:22.535 --> 08:24.603
Okay, give us some space.

08:24.605 --> 08:28.206
Good distal c.F.M.
Pulse is tachy at 110.

08:28.208 --> 08:29.274
Thanks for coming.

08:29.276 --> 08:30.775
I wouldn't miss it, pal.

08:30.777 --> 08:31.977
Miller.
Luke.

08:31.979 --> 08:33.278
He's lost a lot of blood.
Pulsatile.

08:33.280 --> 08:35.847
It's okay, man.
I got it. Thank you.

08:35.849 --> 08:37.516
(luke) aah! Aah!

08:37.518 --> 08:38.750
Luke, can you feel your toes?

08:38.752 --> 08:42.020
Crepitus, the chest.
Probably a fractured rib.

08:42.022 --> 08:44.956
Looks like a distal radius
fracture, as well.

08:44.958 --> 08:46.825
Good news, that neurovascular
bundle's intact.

08:46.827 --> 08:49.027
Oh, I'm finding it hard to get
excited about that right now.

08:49.029 --> 08:50.595
Well, at least
you won't be paralyzed.

08:50.597 --> 08:52.230
Okay, difficult news...

08:52.232 --> 08:53.632
We pull you off this thing...

08:53.634 --> 08:54.733
I'll empty
like a water balloon.

08:56.235 --> 08:58.069
We have to cut it.

08:58.071 --> 08:59.170
Cut it?

08:59.172 --> 09:00.839
(alex) liver is clear.

09:00.841 --> 09:03.141
(air hose hissing,
monitors beeping steadily)

09:03.143 --> 09:05.610
So is the rest of
the peritoneal cavity.

09:05.612 --> 09:07.946
I'm gonna check
the primary area.

09:07.948 --> 09:10.882
Maggie, are you able to tell me
the components of the tumor?

09:12.318 --> 09:14.819
Maggie?
What?

09:14.821 --> 09:16.021
Wow. I'm a space cadet today.

09:16.023 --> 09:18.590
Um, 'cause I... Sorry.
Not focused.

09:18.592 --> 09:22.827
Um, t.N.M. Components
include tumor size,

09:22.829 --> 09:26.064
Positive nodes,
and metastatic disease.

09:26.066 --> 09:27.666
Just checking.
Stay with me here.

09:27.668 --> 09:29.067
Mm-hmm.

09:29.069 --> 09:31.736
(alex) okay.

09:31.738 --> 09:34.239
No inter-abdominal metastases.

09:34.241 --> 09:37.075
Proximal sigmoid
is mobile.

09:37.077 --> 09:39.878
Rectosigmoid's clear.

09:40.813 --> 09:42.847
Okay.

09:42.849 --> 09:45.984
Part of the tumor is stuck
to the side of the uterus.

09:45.986 --> 09:49.688
I think maybe if I can get
my fingers in there...

09:49.690 --> 09:51.056
Might be able
to peel it off.

09:51.058 --> 09:53.258
I just have to...

09:53.260 --> 09:55.760
Do you mind backing up a little
bit? I need some room.

09:57.897 --> 09:58.964
Umbilical tape?

09:58.966 --> 10:00.198
Mm-hmm.

10:00.200 --> 10:01.199
Okay.

10:01.201 --> 10:02.767
Kelly.

10:08.207 --> 10:09.274
Yeah.

10:10.710 --> 10:12.344
And pull up on it.
Mm-hmm.

10:12.346 --> 10:15.080
Cautery, please.

10:15.082 --> 10:18.717
I don't like
being this close to the uterus.

10:19.919 --> 10:22.821
(beeping)

10:26.792 --> 10:28.126
Got it.
You did it.

10:28.128 --> 10:31.096
I did. Now let's get
that tumor out.

10:31.098 --> 10:33.098
Uh-oh.
(beeping)

10:33.100 --> 10:34.232
It's amniotic fluid.

10:34.234 --> 10:35.834
Her water just broke.

10:35.836 --> 10:37.135
Kalfas.

10:39.939 --> 10:41.106
Did you nick the uterus?

10:41.108 --> 10:42.807
I might have.

10:44.744 --> 10:47.112
Can the fetus survive this?

10:47.114 --> 10:48.413
I don't think so.

10:51.017 --> 10:52.083
(exhales)

10:54.086 --> 10:56.287
Don't worry. We're gonna get you
out of here in no time, man.

10:56.289 --> 10:57.656
I'm gonna call alex.
No.

10:57.658 --> 10:58.757
Don't, joel. I mean it.

10:58.759 --> 11:01.059
I'm not gonna
put her through it.

11:01.061 --> 11:02.961
Just get me out of here,
I'll talk to her in person.

11:02.963 --> 11:05.397
(saw motor revving)
(man) step back.

11:05.399 --> 11:07.866
(loud buzzing)

11:07.868 --> 11:09.067
Aah!

11:10.703 --> 11:12.137
Aah!

11:12.139 --> 11:13.938
Aah!

11:17.043 --> 11:18.043
(siren whoops)

11:18.045 --> 11:19.711
Fall from heights.

11:19.713 --> 11:21.746
Impaled and through
the proximal thigh.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.048
Open segmental fracture
of the femur.

11:23.050 --> 11:26.184
G.C.S. 15, heart rate 125,
b.P. 80/50.

11:26.186 --> 11:28.153
Put another line in.
Bolus saline, amp of tetanus,

11:28.155 --> 11:29.254
Gram of cefazolin.

11:29.256 --> 11:30.855
We can't put him
in the c.T. Like this.

11:30.857 --> 11:32.791
Yeah, no kidding. Let's prep
a lateral x-ray, please.

11:32.793 --> 11:34.392
On three. One, two, three.

11:34.394 --> 11:37.128
(labored breathing)

11:37.130 --> 11:39.998
Yeah, that soft tissue
injury's gonna be bad.

11:40.000 --> 11:41.032
Yeah, that lower
fracture's clean,

11:41.034 --> 11:42.033
But the proximal one's...

11:42.035 --> 11:46.004
Look at that.
Four, five pieces.
Hey, you page me?

11:46.006 --> 11:47.272
I did. Let's walk.

11:47.274 --> 11:48.339
Wow.

11:48.341 --> 11:49.808
Pretty much my sentiment.

11:49.810 --> 11:53.211
Unfortunately, angles are
limited for obvious reasons.

11:53.213 --> 11:56.748
What can you do? You pull it
out, see what happens, react.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.283
(joel) yeah.

11:58.285 --> 12:00.151
I don't remember the last time
you paged me for a consult.

12:00.153 --> 12:02.854
I'll do you one better.
You wanna scrub in?

12:02.856 --> 12:05.290
The patient is luke reid.

12:05.292 --> 12:06.291
Does alex know?

12:06.293 --> 12:07.992
He doesn't want her to know.

12:07.994 --> 12:09.060
Hey. Charlie.

12:09.062 --> 12:11.162
See you in the o.R.!

12:11.164 --> 12:13.298
(monitor beeping steadily)

12:13.300 --> 12:18.203
(hearts beating over monitor)

12:29.181 --> 12:30.415
Hey, uh,
how's it going in here?

12:30.417 --> 12:31.816
Not now.

12:35.287 --> 12:36.921
(monitor beeps,
hearts beating)

12:36.923 --> 12:39.257
Fetal heartbeat's slowing.
Indicates cord compression.

12:39.259 --> 12:41.760
At least they're
in separate sacs.

12:41.762 --> 12:43.094
Baby's dead within a few hours.

12:43.096 --> 12:44.863
She can still have
one healthy baby.

12:44.865 --> 12:48.433
Look, we--we can't do anything
with the compromised fetus

12:48.435 --> 12:50.502
Without putting
the healthy one at risk.

12:50.504 --> 12:53.171
The chances of survival
outside the womb right now

12:53.173 --> 12:55.273
Are basically zero. I'm sorry.
They're just not viable.

12:55.275 --> 12:58.309
She has to go around with
a fetus dying inside of her?

12:58.311 --> 13:00.311
We can induce
in six to seven weeks,

13:00.313 --> 13:02.013
Where she'll most likely
have a healthy baby.

13:02.015 --> 13:04.949
Considering her case,
that's already beating the odds.

13:04.951 --> 13:07.418
You know what, dr. Kalfas? If
you have nothing else to offer,

13:07.420 --> 13:08.953
I need to finish this surgery.

13:08.955 --> 13:13.424
(hearts beating out of sync)

13:13.426 --> 13:16.461
Let's get the leads off.
I can't concentrate.

13:18.063 --> 13:19.497
Okay. Cautery.

13:23.469 --> 13:25.470
(joel) so I take it
you didn't tell alex?

13:25.472 --> 13:27.305
No. She needs to concentrate
on her job

13:27.307 --> 13:29.340
And we need
to concentrate on ours.

13:31.577 --> 13:32.911
Looks like we're clear
of the mess now.

13:32.913 --> 13:35.446
Let's get a retractor in there

13:35.448 --> 13:37.849
To protect
that neurovascular bundle.

13:37.851 --> 13:40.251
Thank you.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.353
Okay. That should do it.

13:43.889 --> 13:45.390
I pull, you pounce.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.091
You got it.

13:47.093 --> 13:48.393
On three.

13:48.395 --> 13:49.394
One...

13:49.396 --> 13:51.296
Two...

13:51.298 --> 13:52.597
Three.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.265
(squishing)

13:54.267 --> 13:56.901
(monitor beeping rapidly)

13:56.903 --> 13:59.571
Ligating. Suction.

13:59.573 --> 14:02.841
(suction whooshing)

14:04.210 --> 14:05.610
That is a mess.

14:05.612 --> 14:07.846
A lot of missing bone.

14:07.848 --> 14:10.248
It gets worse. The proximal
side's completely shattered.

14:10.250 --> 14:12.116
By the time we fish
those bits out,

14:12.118 --> 14:14.185
I bet there's,
I don't know...

14:14.187 --> 14:15.486
15-centimeter gap
in that bone.

14:15.488 --> 14:17.055
As much as the kid
drives me up the wall,

14:17.057 --> 14:18.189
I don't feel like
chopping off his leg.

14:18.191 --> 14:19.924
Taylor spatial frame?

14:19.926 --> 14:21.459
No. There's not enough
there to work with.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.927
No one's ever lengthened
an adult

14:22.929 --> 14:24.395
More than a couple centimeters.

14:24.397 --> 14:25.930
What about replanting
the missing bone?

14:25.932 --> 14:30.602
What is your success rate
on a total femur replacement?

14:30.604 --> 14:33.137
20%, if I'm being generous.
You?

14:33.139 --> 14:36.608
Okay. Let's build this kid
a new bone.

14:36.610 --> 14:39.110
I don't see another option.
You ever done one?

14:39.112 --> 14:40.445
Yeah, I have. Once.

14:40.447 --> 14:42.247
And?

14:42.249 --> 14:44.215
The pig seemed very satisfied.

14:47.086 --> 14:49.153
Okay. That'll have to do.

14:52.992 --> 14:55.994
(monitor beeping steadily)

14:59.198 --> 15:01.933
(inhales, exhales)

15:01.935 --> 15:03.935
(knocks)

15:03.937 --> 15:05.403
Carrie. Hi.

15:07.140 --> 15:10.275
And to, uh, fill you in
on how the surgery--

15:10.277 --> 15:11.542
I know how it went.

15:14.446 --> 15:16.981
I guess dr. Kalfas
talked to you?

15:16.983 --> 15:22.954
He told me one of my babies
is... Dying inside me.

15:22.956 --> 15:26.090
(cries) and nobody's doing
anything about it.

15:26.092 --> 15:28.293
I am so sorry.

15:28.295 --> 15:31.362
But we will make sure
your other fetus is healthy.

15:31.364 --> 15:35.934
Monitor both of you.
You know he's still alive,
right?

15:37.336 --> 15:40.238
(crying) his heart
is slowing down,

15:40.240 --> 15:42.674
But he's still alive.

15:42.676 --> 15:45.376
I think that he's a fighter.

15:45.378 --> 15:47.211
I do. I think
he wants to live,

15:47.213 --> 15:50.248
And I think... I think
that we should induce labor.

15:50.250 --> 15:54.485
But I'm sure dr. Kalfas
already explained to you...

15:54.487 --> 15:57.188
They're pre-viable.

15:57.190 --> 15:58.189
They won't survive.

15:58.191 --> 16:01.259
(crying)

16:04.029 --> 16:07.365
I can't... I can't lie here

16:07.367 --> 16:11.369
And just... I can't let him
just die inside me.

16:13.272 --> 16:17.375
How am I supposed to do that?

16:17.377 --> 16:18.710
How do I do that?

16:22.748 --> 16:25.416
(sniffles)

16:25.418 --> 16:28.686
I know it's awful.

16:28.688 --> 16:32.290
But your other baby will
continue to grow and develop.

16:32.292 --> 16:36.627
It was threatening your life,
and we've looked after that.

16:36.629 --> 16:40.164
It'll be a while until
the pathology results are in,

16:40.166 --> 16:43.501
But I'm very confident
that we got all the cancer out.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.470
So you will be around
to raise your baby.

16:45.472 --> 16:47.638
(breathes deeply)

16:47.640 --> 16:50.608
(crying)

16:52.578 --> 16:54.379
I'll be back in a little bit.

16:58.117 --> 16:59.117
Dr. Reid.

16:59.119 --> 17:00.752
Hey.

17:00.754 --> 17:01.753
You all right?

17:01.755 --> 17:03.021
No. I'm a general surgeon.

17:03.023 --> 17:05.089
I see a problem,
I intervene.

17:05.091 --> 17:06.524
That's the difference
between general surgery

17:06.526 --> 17:07.592
And obstetrics,
I guess.

17:09.561 --> 17:10.661
(exhales)

17:10.663 --> 17:12.263
Smallest baby I ever delivered

17:12.265 --> 17:15.666
Was under 500 grams.
She was 24 weeks along.

17:15.668 --> 17:18.269
She was born blind, she had
bronchopulmonary dysplasia,

17:18.271 --> 17:20.571
And she spent the first
and only month of her life

17:20.573 --> 17:22.140
In an incubator.

17:22.142 --> 17:24.675
Before she died
of heart failure.

17:24.677 --> 17:29.580
But for that one month, boy,
did I ever want to do something.

17:29.582 --> 17:32.283
Carrie's been trying
to get pregnant for four years.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.485
She sold her house to afford
the fertility treatments.

17:34.487 --> 17:36.587
Sorry. I shouldn't be
taking this out on you.

17:36.589 --> 17:38.523
Hey. Uh, I've been reading

17:38.525 --> 17:40.558
About inter-amniotic
injection of platelets.

17:40.560 --> 17:42.126
I think we should try it.
Uh...

17:42.128 --> 17:44.262
What's that?

17:44.264 --> 17:45.663
It's the amniopatch.

17:45.665 --> 17:48.599
You inject fluid and plasma
into the amniotic sac.

17:48.601 --> 17:52.170
It can create a patch
to prevent further leakage.

17:52.172 --> 17:53.671
Why are we not
considering this?

17:53.673 --> 17:55.807
Because it's still experimental,
and it's not widely practiced.

17:55.809 --> 17:59.811
But basically, it's like doing
a reverse amniocentesis, right?

17:59.813 --> 18:01.646
Uh... I guess.

18:01.648 --> 18:04.816
Uh, well, for one,
the substance can cause a drop

18:04.818 --> 18:06.617
In the fetal blood pressure
and heart rate,

18:06.619 --> 18:09.821
But if the baby's dying anyway,
isn't it worth it?

18:09.823 --> 18:12.523
Okay, but the truth is,
I've never done one.

18:12.525 --> 18:14.392
So?

18:16.829 --> 18:18.162
Let me take a look at this.

18:18.164 --> 18:19.197
I'm thinking that's a "yes."

18:19.199 --> 18:21.265
Do you mind if I borrow?

18:21.267 --> 18:24.235
Oh, sure. Borrow.
Borrow whatever you need.

18:27.406 --> 18:29.707
I can't think straight
around that man.

18:33.278 --> 18:36.314
(indistinct conversations,
baby crying)

18:38.484 --> 18:39.550
Hey.

18:39.552 --> 18:42.553
Isn't charlie
working trauma today?

18:42.555 --> 18:45.223
I... I don't know.
He--he was.

18:45.225 --> 18:46.791
Well, where is he?

18:48.260 --> 18:50.228
I don't know. He's...
(exhales)

18:50.230 --> 18:51.496
Probably with joel.

18:53.232 --> 18:54.599
Okay. And where's joel?

18:55.834 --> 18:57.135
With charlie?

18:57.137 --> 18:58.436
(chuckles)

18:58.438 --> 19:00.304
Zach, you have exactly
five seconds

19:00.306 --> 19:01.772
To tell me what's going on.

19:05.711 --> 19:07.578
(joel) lisa, give me
the vancomycin.

19:07.580 --> 19:10.748
(monitor beeping)

19:10.750 --> 19:12.617
(suction whooshing)

19:12.619 --> 19:13.851
Alex. He's fine.

19:13.853 --> 19:15.720
Honey.

19:15.722 --> 19:16.787
He's fine.

19:17.789 --> 19:18.823
Is he gonna lose his leg?

19:18.825 --> 19:19.824
Not if we can help it, no.

19:19.826 --> 19:22.560
Because he specifically
asked us not to.

19:22.562 --> 19:23.828
And you listened to him?
Charlie?

19:23.830 --> 19:24.829
You were in surgery.

19:24.831 --> 19:26.430
So what? I'm scrubbing in.

19:26.432 --> 19:28.633
Alex, you can't operate
on a family member.

19:28.635 --> 19:29.901
You have nothing
to offer this surgery.

19:29.903 --> 19:32.603
You will only slow us down.

19:32.605 --> 19:34.639
So please get out of here
and let us work.

19:36.708 --> 19:39.577
(sighs)

19:39.579 --> 19:42.580
Okay.
(suction whooshing)

19:45.317 --> 19:46.584
(charlie) suction.

19:46.586 --> 19:49.220
(suction whooshing)

19:55.961 --> 19:58.596
(whirring)

19:58.598 --> 20:00.364
(whirring stops,
monitor beeping)

20:00.366 --> 20:01.699
Why am I not surprised
that we're here?

20:01.701 --> 20:03.634
This kid attracts trouble.

20:03.636 --> 20:05.536
He was trying to help someone.

20:05.538 --> 20:06.871
(beep)

20:06.873 --> 20:08.639
Guess he should have
waited for backup, then.

20:08.641 --> 20:11.442
He's in a million pieces
right now, mate.

20:11.444 --> 20:12.610
He's irresponsible.

20:12.612 --> 20:13.611
Right, but it might not
be the time

20:13.613 --> 20:15.213
For you to be mad at him.

20:15.215 --> 20:16.214
Look, he's not a bad kid.

20:16.216 --> 20:18.549
You knew him when he was
19, joel.

20:18.551 --> 20:20.384
Yeah.
It's okay to be
a mess when you're 19.

20:20.386 --> 20:21.719
He's pushing 30.

20:21.721 --> 20:22.853
(whirring)

20:24.556 --> 20:26.457
(beep)

20:26.459 --> 20:28.826
She worries all the time.

20:28.828 --> 20:30.328
You don't know what it's like.

20:32.431 --> 20:34.699
I do know what it's like,
actually.

20:34.701 --> 20:37.501
(whirring)

20:37.503 --> 20:39.270
She worries about
a lot of things.

20:39.272 --> 20:40.671
(whirring stops)

20:43.375 --> 20:44.909
(whirs, stops)

20:44.911 --> 20:46.544
We're stabilized here.

20:50.449 --> 20:52.350
His heart's in the right place.

20:52.352 --> 20:54.418
Okay? This is bad luck.

20:54.420 --> 20:56.954
I don't know.

20:56.956 --> 20:58.889
Fell five stories, he's gonna
live to tell about it.

20:58.891 --> 21:00.458
His luck's not all that bad.

21:02.394 --> 21:05.863
(monitor beeping steadily)

21:06.965 --> 21:08.633
(door opens)

21:13.705 --> 21:15.873
He's all good.
Joel's just closing him up.

21:15.875 --> 21:18.809
(inhales and exhales sharply)

21:18.811 --> 21:19.910
He's okay?

21:19.912 --> 21:21.412
Yeah, come on.

21:21.414 --> 21:23.781
These... Capable hands?

21:26.718 --> 21:30.354
Next time, you tell me.
Okay?

21:30.356 --> 21:33.924
(sighs) your little brother's
in one piece.

21:33.926 --> 21:35.559
That's what matters.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.499
Thank you.

21:48.373 --> 21:50.808
Gavin, I need therapy.

21:50.810 --> 21:52.810
(door closes)
I'm all ears.

21:52.812 --> 21:54.679
I'll even give you
a discount.

21:54.681 --> 21:56.080
Something is wrong with me,

21:56.082 --> 21:58.516
And I need to get it
off my chest.

21:58.518 --> 22:02.586
Today, I have had to work
with a <i>really</i> good-looking--

22:02.588 --> 22:05.589
I'm talking sex symbol--
obstetrician,

22:05.591 --> 22:07.758
And he's really thrown me
off my game.

22:07.760 --> 22:10.728
I'm--I'm all sweaty
and weird,

22:10.730 --> 22:13.631
And I started to think, wow,
maybe I'm lacking vitamins.

22:13.633 --> 22:17.802
But, no, I think...
Actually it's--it's dr. Kalfas.

22:19.404 --> 22:21.806
And you're telling me
this because...

22:21.808 --> 22:23.374
Because--because
you're my guy,

22:23.376 --> 22:25.009
And I don't want to keep
secrets from you,

22:25.011 --> 22:27.611
And I think that you are
very good-looking,

22:27.613 --> 22:31.015
In a real, sweet way.

22:33.051 --> 22:36.821
As... Opposed to the manly
sex symbol way?

22:36.823 --> 22:38.622
Exactly.

22:38.624 --> 22:40.825
(siren wailing in distance)

22:40.827 --> 22:42.393
I feel better.

22:42.395 --> 22:43.928
Cool.

22:43.930 --> 22:45.663
You're good.

22:45.665 --> 22:47.698
Thanks for coming by.

22:47.700 --> 22:49.066
Love you.

22:49.068 --> 22:50.468
Yeah.

22:51.570 --> 22:53.037
Mm-hmm.

22:53.039 --> 22:56.140
(monitor beeping steadily)

22:56.142 --> 23:00.745
(breathing deeply)

23:00.747 --> 23:02.680
(exhales)

23:08.019 --> 23:09.820
What were you calling about?

23:13.158 --> 23:14.825
It doesn't matter.

23:18.163 --> 23:20.831
Is there anything
I don't screw up?

23:20.833 --> 23:22.733
Not much.

23:26.872 --> 23:28.172
You stir life up.

23:28.174 --> 23:29.940
(exhales)

23:29.942 --> 23:31.542
That's why people love you.

23:31.544 --> 23:33.511
(chuckles) is that right?

23:33.513 --> 23:36.580
Mm-hmm.
(inhales deeply)

23:36.582 --> 23:38.482
(exhales) half the time
I don't mean to.

23:38.484 --> 23:40.684
I'm just unlucky.
(sighs)

23:40.686 --> 23:43.421
Hmm.

23:43.423 --> 23:46.090
It's like the wishbone,
you know?

23:46.092 --> 23:47.892
Remember the wishbone?

23:47.894 --> 23:50.161
(laughs)
(chuckles)

23:50.163 --> 23:51.796
(snickers)

23:51.798 --> 23:54.465
You always got the big piece.
You remember that?

23:55.934 --> 23:57.701
I never did, not once.

23:58.703 --> 23:59.970
Ah.

23:59.972 --> 24:01.806
It's not like my wishes
always came true.

24:01.808 --> 24:03.741
Well...

24:04.910 --> 24:06.577
They mostly did.

24:06.579 --> 24:08.646
Well, the only thing
I'd wish for right now

24:08.648 --> 24:10.748
Is for you to get better.

24:14.152 --> 24:15.786
(exhales)
you know what?

24:15.788 --> 24:18.489
I can't get my hands
on a chicken bone right now.

24:23.528 --> 24:25.596
Maybe this will do.

24:25.598 --> 24:27.498
Make a wish?

24:29.067 --> 24:30.734
(exhales)

24:30.736 --> 24:32.169
Got it?

24:33.138 --> 24:34.171
Pull.

24:34.173 --> 24:35.639
(snaps)

24:35.641 --> 24:36.707
(both chuckle)

24:36.709 --> 24:40.578
(continues chuckling)

24:40.580 --> 24:42.680
(groans) ah, you see
what I mean?

24:42.682 --> 24:44.081
(chuckles)

24:44.083 --> 24:46.817
I'm unlucky. I'm... Cursed.

24:46.819 --> 24:48.486
No, it's just a...
(clatters)

24:48.488 --> 24:50.855
Stupid piece of plastic.
It was a dumb idea.

24:50.857 --> 24:53.991
It was a dumb idea.
Yeah.

24:53.993 --> 24:56.861
But you know what I wished for?
What?

24:56.863 --> 24:59.096
I wished...

24:59.098 --> 25:01.165
I wasn't a drunk.

25:02.834 --> 25:05.703
And that we can go back
to the old man's camper.

25:07.072 --> 25:10.207
Some beer.
Just a little bit.

25:10.209 --> 25:13.043
Some caps, a little game.
You know?

25:14.613 --> 25:15.913
Those were good times.

25:15.915 --> 25:17.982
(chuckles and sighs)

25:21.953 --> 25:25.256
(exhales) are you ash--
are you ashamed of me?

25:26.958 --> 25:30.694
Are you kidding me?
No.

25:30.696 --> 25:31.829
No.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.264
Okay.

25:33.266 --> 25:35.966
Then what were you
calling me about?

25:38.236 --> 25:40.604
Hmm.

25:40.606 --> 25:43.040
Let's not talk about that now.

25:50.048 --> 25:53.050
(indistinct conversations)

26:04.129 --> 26:05.262
What, gavin?

26:07.666 --> 26:10.834
Can I ask you a question?
Yes.

26:10.836 --> 26:14.672
You're a good-looking dude,
don't you think?

26:14.674 --> 26:16.006
Yeah.

26:16.008 --> 26:17.708
I think I'm a good-looking
guy, you know?

26:17.710 --> 26:19.009
But I'm not objective, so...

26:20.178 --> 26:23.113
On the good-looking scale,
what would you...

26:23.115 --> 26:25.583
What would you think
that I am?

26:25.585 --> 26:28.652
Like, objectively.
If you had to rate me.

26:31.990 --> 26:34.592
7.38 if you had
your shirt tucked in.

26:34.594 --> 26:35.993
(elevator bell dings)

26:37.295 --> 26:39.363
Hi.
Hey.

26:40.599 --> 26:42.967
Now that is
a good-looking dude.

26:42.969 --> 26:44.702
That's like a 9.2.

26:44.704 --> 26:46.036
(monitors beeping steadily)

26:46.038 --> 26:47.137
(groans)

26:47.139 --> 26:48.272
Okay, let me check your arm.

26:48.274 --> 26:49.840
Ah, stop fussing.

26:49.842 --> 26:51.241
What would you like me
to do?

26:51.243 --> 26:53.877
Just... Ah, just help me
sit up.

26:55.880 --> 26:57.314
(groans)
all right?

26:57.316 --> 27:00.050
That's fine.
That's fine, that's fine.

27:00.052 --> 27:02.252
How about your leg?

27:02.254 --> 27:05.656
I know you know about
the pills.

27:05.658 --> 27:06.824
They weren't mine, alex.

27:08.360 --> 27:10.728
They weren't mine,
all right?

27:10.730 --> 27:11.962
Okay.

27:11.964 --> 27:13.831
You don't believe me.
It doesn't matter.

27:13.833 --> 27:16.133
All right, well,
we're in a hospital.

27:16.135 --> 27:18.268
It's a perfect time
for a confessional.
It doesn't matter.

27:18.270 --> 27:21.005
No, no, no.
You wanna know... The truth.

27:21.007 --> 27:23.707
I'll tell you the truth.

27:23.709 --> 27:26.377
Remember pop's, uh, big scratch
on his old buick?

27:26.379 --> 27:29.079
You got blamed for that.
That was me.

27:29.081 --> 27:31.315
Grandma's gaudy ring that went
missing--that was me, too.

27:31.317 --> 27:33.017
Luke.
No, no, no, no, no.

27:33.019 --> 27:34.952
Remember when I found
your wallet on the ground?

27:34.954 --> 27:37.888
I stole 20 bucks from it
before I gave it back to you.

27:37.890 --> 27:40.357
And yolanda, your old pal,
you remember her?

27:40.359 --> 27:42.660
Yeah, she dropped you like
a hot potato. You know why?

27:42.662 --> 27:45.763
Because... I slept with her.

27:45.765 --> 27:47.231
And I didn't call her back.
(chuckles)

27:47.233 --> 27:49.033
I'm--I'm gonna go.

27:49.035 --> 27:50.801
The pills aren't mine,
though, alex.

27:50.803 --> 27:52.670
Doesn't matter.
Say you believe me.

27:54.706 --> 27:56.440
Fine.

27:56.442 --> 27:58.709
I believe you.
All right?

28:00.211 --> 28:02.046
Alex!
Yeah?

28:03.281 --> 28:04.815
I love you.

28:05.884 --> 28:07.351
(exhales)

28:10.021 --> 28:12.156
(heartbeat on monitor)
okay, so we have plasma,
platelets,

28:12.158 --> 28:13.891
And the clear solution
is ringer's.

28:13.893 --> 28:16.226
We'll alternate 20 ccs
of each until they've filled

28:16.228 --> 28:17.895
The amniotic sac
with enough fluid.

28:17.897 --> 28:19.730
And what about the tear?
What if it starts to leak again?

28:19.732 --> 28:21.799
It shouldn't. The platelets
will act like glue,

28:21.801 --> 28:23.400
Find the leak, and seal it up
if all goes well.

28:23.402 --> 28:26.036
And, uh, what if they don't?
I mean...

28:26.038 --> 28:28.972
Well, you need to remain
still, okay? Very still.

28:28.974 --> 28:31.175
The needle can't move.
You understand?

28:31.177 --> 28:32.910
Yeah. Yeah.

28:32.912 --> 28:34.411
You okay?
Yeah.

28:34.413 --> 28:35.879
Hi. Do you mind if I join?

28:35.881 --> 28:37.181
Sure. If you could
watch the monitor.

28:37.183 --> 28:40.451
You ready?
I'm ready.

28:40.453 --> 28:41.819
All right.
(beep)

28:43.788 --> 28:44.955
(exhales)

28:46.357 --> 28:48.826
Hey. Welcome back.

28:48.828 --> 28:50.794
(exhales)

28:50.796 --> 28:52.262
Where's alex?

28:53.299 --> 28:57.067
Yeah, she's fine. She's,
uh, worried about you.

28:57.069 --> 28:59.803
Yeah? Okay.
Yeah.

28:59.805 --> 29:01.839
(exhales) what's going on
with my leg?

29:01.841 --> 29:04.508
Just investigating that
right now, luke.
Yeah.

29:04.510 --> 29:07.077
Good. That's good.
Where's alex?

29:07.079 --> 29:09.747
She--she's fine, buddy.

29:11.249 --> 29:13.784
Something doesn't feel
right. Uh...
(monitor beeping faster)

29:13.786 --> 29:16.053
Okay, your sats are low.
Hey, luke--
I need to get up.

29:16.055 --> 29:17.855
No, no, no.
No, no, no, no.
I need to get up.

29:17.857 --> 29:19.323
No, no, no. Hey. Hey.
I need you to help me up, joel.

29:19.325 --> 29:23.093
Why don't you relax?
Just--just lie back.
I need you to help me get up--

29:23.095 --> 29:24.461
Hey. Listen to me.
You need to--
yeah. Yeah.

29:24.463 --> 29:27.064
Hey. Hey! Hey--get me
a nurse in here, please!

29:27.066 --> 29:30.968
(monitor beeping,
second tone beeps)

29:32.203 --> 29:34.505
(rapid beeping)

29:37.510 --> 29:42.212
(tone beeps)
<i>(woman on p.A.) code blue,</i>
<i>I.C.U., med three.</i>

29:42.214 --> 29:44.782
<i>Code blue, I.C.U., med three.</i>

29:44.784 --> 29:44.948
<i>Code blue, I.C.U.</i>

29:49.954 --> 29:51.121
(monitors beeping rapidly)
neck veins are distended.

29:51.123 --> 29:52.489
He's got pulseless electrical
activity.

29:52.491 --> 29:53.957
C.P.R.'s not gonna help him.
It's a cardiac tamponade.

29:53.959 --> 29:55.425
Get me the ultrasound.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.230
(beeping continues)

30:00.232 --> 30:02.366
(beeps)
there's a ton of blood
around his heart.

30:02.368 --> 30:03.901
We have to drain it.

30:03.903 --> 30:05.369
Get me an 18-gauge
spinal needle

30:05.371 --> 30:07.137
And a 20 cc syringe.

30:07.139 --> 30:09.139
We should call cardiac.

30:09.141 --> 30:10.808
There's no time.

30:11.910 --> 30:13.043
Okay...

30:15.313 --> 30:17.014
(beeping continues)

30:22.220 --> 30:24.054
It's filling up.
So far, so good.

30:24.056 --> 30:25.489
(heart beating on monitor)
(kalfas) now the plasma.

30:25.491 --> 30:27.024
Yep.

30:27.026 --> 30:29.359
Fetal heartbeat's slowing.
What's going on?

30:29.361 --> 30:31.361
Vaso-spasm?
The vessels are contracting.

30:31.363 --> 30:34.431
Carrie, we know this isn't
a sure thing.
What is happening?

30:34.433 --> 30:36.066
Why is that happening?
Carrie, you need to be still.

30:36.068 --> 30:37.601
Why is his heartbeat dropping?
Carrie, don't move.

30:37.603 --> 30:39.837
We can do something, right?
You can do something, right?

30:39.839 --> 30:43.106
Carrie, sit back.
No, no, no, no.
No, no, no. No drugs.

30:43.108 --> 30:44.975
No. Don't knock me out.
I promise I won't move.

30:44.977 --> 30:46.510
I won't move.
Carrie, listen to my voice.

30:46.512 --> 30:47.845
Yeah?
Breathe.

30:47.847 --> 30:49.880
I won't move. I won't move.

30:49.882 --> 30:51.381
Okay, look at me.

30:51.383 --> 30:53.483
Be calm.

30:53.485 --> 30:55.252
You're gonna be fine.
It's gonna be okay, right?

30:55.254 --> 30:57.855
It's gonna be fine.
Just breathe.

30:57.857 --> 30:59.456
It's gonna be a okay.

30:59.458 --> 31:01.191
(breathes deeply)
breathe.

31:01.193 --> 31:04.494
Please, please,
please, please, please.

31:04.496 --> 31:06.997
Come on.
Please, please, please.

31:06.999 --> 31:08.565
Come on, baby. Come on.

31:08.567 --> 31:10.133
Please, please.
(beep)

31:10.135 --> 31:11.869
There we go.
Yeah.

31:11.871 --> 31:13.237
(heartbeat increases)
he is a little fighter.

31:13.239 --> 31:15.239
Yeah. Yeah. (laughs)

31:15.241 --> 31:18.141
(laughing)
you're in the clear.

31:18.143 --> 31:20.110
You're gonna have
a devil on your hands.

31:20.112 --> 31:21.511
I hope he's a little
hell-raiser.

31:21.513 --> 31:23.146
(laughing)

31:23.148 --> 31:25.015
Alex, come with me.

31:25.017 --> 31:27.050
What is it?
It's luke.

31:29.254 --> 31:30.654
He went into p.E.A.

31:30.656 --> 31:33.457
And the ultrasound showed
blood from his chest cavity.

31:40.298 --> 31:41.398
<i>Charlie?</i>

31:41.400 --> 31:43.567
You...

31:43.569 --> 31:45.535
(grunts indistinctly)

31:45.537 --> 31:49.072
(james blake) â™ª I don't know
about my dreams â™ª

31:51.910 --> 31:56.113
â™ª I don't know about

â™ª all that I know is

31:58.550 --> 32:03.921
â™ª I'm falling, falling,
falling, falling â™ª

32:06.157 --> 32:08.592
â™ª might as well fall in

32:08.594 --> 32:11.695
(electricity surging)
(echoes) clear!

32:11.697 --> 32:14.464
(electricity crackles)
â™ª I don't know about my love

32:15.934 --> 32:18.168
(rhythmic panting)
clear!

32:18.170 --> 32:20.003
â™ª I don't about my

32:20.005 --> 32:21.104
â™ª loving anymore

32:21.106 --> 32:22.372
Alex, you shouldn't be here.

32:22.374 --> 32:23.674
Get out of here.
â™ª all that I know is

32:23.676 --> 32:26.443
Come on, pal.
â™ª I'm falling, falling

32:26.445 --> 32:28.512
â™ª falling, falling
clear!

32:28.514 --> 32:31.014
(electricity crackles)

32:31.016 --> 32:33.216
â™ª might as well fall in

32:33.218 --> 32:35.185
Hey! Look at me!

32:35.187 --> 32:38.322
Look at me! Alex!

32:38.324 --> 32:40.090
Get out of here!

32:40.092 --> 32:41.425
I need to be here.
(electricity surging)

32:41.427 --> 32:44.194
Clear!
(electricity crackles)

32:44.196 --> 32:46.296
Come on.

32:46.298 --> 32:48.332
Clear!
Luke...

32:48.334 --> 32:50.133
(electricity crackles,
monitors beeping rapidly)

32:50.135 --> 32:52.636
â™ª I'm falling, falling,
falling â™ª

32:52.638 --> 32:55.439
â™ª falling
(panting rhythmically)

32:55.441 --> 32:58.408
(panting continues)

33:01.713 --> 33:03.413
<i>You old dog.</i>

33:03.415 --> 33:05.315
<i>I knew there was something</i>
<i>weird about you.</i>

33:05.317 --> 33:07.150
Listen to me.

33:07.152 --> 33:09.152
You're not dead yet.
There's still time.

33:09.154 --> 33:11.121
<i>You don't know that.</i>

33:11.123 --> 33:14.424
<i>And to be honest...</i>
<i>This feels all right.</i>

33:14.426 --> 33:16.560
No, no, no, no, no. No.
Are you crazy? Come on.

33:16.562 --> 33:18.295
We need to go right now.
<i>I don't think that I should.</i>

33:18.297 --> 33:21.298
Do you have any idea
what this is gonna do to alex?

33:21.300 --> 33:25.435
<i>She's done enough for me.</i>
<i>I've done a lot to her.</i>

33:25.437 --> 33:29.039
<i>It's got to be hard</i>
<i>to always be disappointed.</i>

33:29.041 --> 33:30.474
<i>She's better off.</i>

33:30.476 --> 33:32.342
â™ª

33:32.344 --> 33:34.444
You're saying your sister
would be better off

33:34.446 --> 33:36.747
If you died?

33:36.749 --> 33:38.648
<i>Yeah, maybe.</i>

33:38.650 --> 33:41.218
<i>Maybe it's better for me.</i>

33:41.220 --> 33:43.420
<i>(sighs and chuckles)</i>

33:43.422 --> 33:44.755
<i>I'm tired.</i>

33:47.225 --> 33:49.426
<i>I've always been scared.</i>

33:49.428 --> 33:52.596
<i>Right now I'm not afraid.</i>
<i>Do you have any idea...</i>

33:52.598 --> 33:54.731
<i>What that feels like?</i>

33:54.733 --> 33:57.100
<i>It feels good.</i>

33:57.102 --> 33:59.403
<i>Charlie, I need you</i>
<i>to do something for me.</i>

33:59.405 --> 34:03.473
â™ª I'm falling, falling,
falling â™ª
(sighs)

34:03.475 --> 34:06.076
(electricity surging)
(joel panting rhythmically)

34:06.078 --> 34:07.711
Clear!
(electricity crackles)

34:07.713 --> 34:09.679
(monitors beeping rapidly)

34:09.681 --> 34:12.482
(panting rhythmically)

34:12.484 --> 34:14.317
(gasps)
(monitor beeps twice)

34:14.319 --> 34:17.220
(flat-lining tone)

34:17.222 --> 34:18.688
He's in asystole.

34:18.690 --> 34:21.792
â™ª I don't know about
my loving anymore â™ª

34:21.794 --> 34:24.227
(sighs)
no. No. Don't give up.

34:24.229 --> 34:25.662
Joel, keep trying.

34:25.664 --> 34:28.765
Alex, it's been
almost 30 minutes.

34:28.767 --> 34:32.069
(crying)
(flat-lining tone continues)

34:32.071 --> 34:34.671
I don't understand.

34:34.673 --> 34:37.140
(breath quavers)

34:37.142 --> 34:38.675
6:17 p.M.

34:38.677 --> 34:40.410
â™ª I don't know about my
I'm so sorry, alex.

34:40.412 --> 34:42.279
â™ª dreaming anymore

34:43.481 --> 34:45.248
â™ª all that I know is

34:45.250 --> 34:50.187
â™ª I'm falling, falling,
falling, falling â™ª

34:50.189 --> 34:52.255
â™ª might as well fall in

34:56.394 --> 34:58.228
(exhales)

34:58.230 --> 34:59.863
When you were playing around
in there

34:59.865 --> 35:01.832
Doing your journal-worthy
surgery,

35:01.834 --> 35:03.633
Were you paying attention
to his sats?

35:05.736 --> 35:08.138
Prolonged surgery
as a risk factor

35:08.140 --> 35:10.373
Is well known to anyone
who practices medicine.

35:12.243 --> 35:14.511
(exhales) I know
it's not your fault.

35:14.513 --> 35:18.381
I just have to be mad
at somebody. (exhales)

35:23.521 --> 35:25.388
Wake me up, charlie.

35:27.191 --> 35:29.226
Please tell me this isn't real.

35:31.462 --> 35:33.597
I don't know what to say.

35:37.502 --> 35:39.336
He died thinking
I was mad at him.

35:39.338 --> 35:41.905
<i>It doesn't matter.</i>

35:41.907 --> 35:44.241
<i>(sniffs)</i>

35:44.243 --> 35:46.243
He knew you loved him.

35:46.245 --> 35:48.879
But I didn't tell him.

35:48.881 --> 35:50.881
<i>I knew.</i>

35:50.883 --> 35:52.215
He knew.

35:52.217 --> 35:54.885
(exhales)
how do you know?

35:54.887 --> 35:57.487
(sighs)

35:57.489 --> 35:59.256
Uh...

35:59.258 --> 36:00.857
He told me lots of things.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.325
<i>I lied.</i>

36:02.327 --> 36:04.294
He lied.

36:04.296 --> 36:05.862
<i>The drugs were mine.</i>
<i>The drugs were his.</i>

36:05.864 --> 36:07.364
<i>Tell her I'm an idiot.</i>

36:07.366 --> 36:10.400
And he's sorry.

36:10.402 --> 36:12.269
Yeah.

36:17.675 --> 36:22.212
You know, when I look
at him, I just...

36:22.214 --> 36:24.614
I see this little boy
who used to

36:24.616 --> 36:27.617
Jump out from behind the couch
and scare the crap out of me.

36:27.619 --> 36:30.187
You know? And then make me
pee in my pants laughing.

36:32.223 --> 36:34.691
And then, bam, he would just
push my buttons

36:34.693 --> 36:36.660
And piss me off.

36:38.396 --> 36:40.230
But then he would turn around

36:40.232 --> 36:43.600
And say the most thoughtful,
wonderful things.

36:45.770 --> 36:48.738
Every time I thought that
I had luke figured out,

36:48.740 --> 36:51.541
I was wrong, right up
until the very end.

36:51.543 --> 36:53.710
<i>(sighs)</i>

36:55.379 --> 36:57.514
He was so full of life,

36:57.516 --> 36:59.983
And I was so proud of him.

37:02.753 --> 37:04.821
And now he'll never know.

37:18.236 --> 37:20.270
That was really nice
work today.

37:20.272 --> 37:22.372
Yeah. Thanks. Um...

37:22.374 --> 37:23.907
I'm sorry if I've been
moody today.

37:23.909 --> 37:26.243
I'm having a weird one.

37:26.245 --> 37:29.913
I'm emotional, I'm flushed
and hungry and thirsty.

37:29.915 --> 37:32.415
It's just... Crazy,
actually.

37:32.417 --> 37:34.851
I can't believe as a doctor you
don't see what's going on here.

37:34.853 --> 37:36.820
What?

37:36.822 --> 37:39.823
The signs are pretty
obvious, right?
Mm?

37:39.825 --> 37:41.825
I mean, you were chewing on
your cup because you have pica.

37:41.827 --> 37:44.261
You have pica for the same
reason that you're

37:44.263 --> 37:46.263
Thirsty and flushed
and feeling weird,

37:46.265 --> 37:48.398
And... No offense,

37:48.400 --> 37:51.968
But your areolas
were also very, um...

37:51.970 --> 37:54.304
Pointy, but...
(chuckles) excuse me?

37:54.306 --> 37:55.572
(chuckles)

37:55.574 --> 37:57.674
Congratulations, dr. Lin.

37:57.676 --> 37:58.942
You're pregnant.

38:04.548 --> 38:05.815
(clicks tongue)

38:05.817 --> 38:07.751
(exhales)

38:16.827 --> 38:18.561
(exhales)

38:20.831 --> 38:21.998
(clicks tongue)

38:23.834 --> 38:25.568
(knocks on door)

38:25.570 --> 38:26.770
Hi.

38:26.772 --> 38:28.605
There you are.
(heart beating on monitor)

38:28.607 --> 38:31.574
Hey. Thank you.

38:31.576 --> 38:32.876
So it went well.

38:34.078 --> 38:35.745
So far.

38:35.747 --> 38:37.614
(heartbeat continues
on monitor)

38:37.616 --> 38:39.683
Dr. Kalfas just came
to check in on us,

38:39.685 --> 38:41.951
And it seems to be working.

38:41.953 --> 38:43.953
(paper on chart rustling)

38:43.955 --> 38:45.889
Looks good. Congratulations.

38:45.891 --> 38:48.958
Yeah. So far.

38:48.960 --> 38:51.027
Mm-hmm.

38:51.029 --> 38:53.430
(sniffles)

38:53.432 --> 38:55.598
Oh, god, listen to that.

38:55.600 --> 38:56.900
(heartbeat continues)

38:56.902 --> 38:59.569
(sighs) isn't it beautiful?

39:02.440 --> 39:04.641
Yeah.

39:04.643 --> 39:06.443
It really is.

39:10.681 --> 39:11.781
Hey.

39:11.783 --> 39:13.950
Hey.

39:13.952 --> 39:15.752
How are you?

39:15.754 --> 39:17.387
I'm fine. How are you?

39:17.389 --> 39:20.457
I'm okay.

39:23.527 --> 39:24.861
Something wrong?

39:25.830 --> 39:26.963
Maybe.

39:26.965 --> 39:30.033
Sexy doctor still on your mind?

39:30.035 --> 39:32.836
Yeah. Sexy doctor.

39:32.838 --> 39:35.538
The hot, steamy, sexpot,

39:35.540 --> 39:37.841
Rock 'n' roll, fourth-year
psych resident

39:37.843 --> 39:39.676
That I sleep with
on a regular basis--

39:39.678 --> 39:40.910
He's on my mind.

39:52.089 --> 39:54.157
What's that from?

39:54.159 --> 39:56.092
Blood test.

39:56.094 --> 39:57.694
Routine?
Mm-hmm.

39:57.696 --> 39:59.562
You ready to go home?

39:59.564 --> 40:01.965
Uh, I got a lot
of paperwork to do,

40:01.967 --> 40:03.833
But you go ahead,
and I'll see you later.

40:03.835 --> 40:04.968
Okay.

40:07.538 --> 40:09.672
Hey, um...

40:09.674 --> 40:11.674
Do you ever think about
getting a dog?

40:11.676 --> 40:14.677
A dog?

40:14.679 --> 40:17.447
You kidding? We're
way too busy for pets.

40:17.449 --> 40:19.416
Yeah.

40:19.418 --> 40:20.984
That's what I thought.

40:24.455 --> 40:26.122
(door closes)

40:26.124 --> 40:28.091
(sighs)

40:29.059 --> 40:30.627
Alex.

40:30.629 --> 40:32.896
I'm going home.
I know.

40:32.898 --> 40:35.131
Luke did know.

40:35.133 --> 40:37.734
What are you talking about?
He--he heard you.

40:40.004 --> 40:43.039
Maybe there's something
more...

40:43.041 --> 40:45.475
To this life, you know?
Maybe.

40:45.477 --> 40:47.644
I-I think when I was
in my coma,

40:47.646 --> 40:49.779
I realized that.

40:49.781 --> 40:52.148
I'm not sure what you're
talking about.
Just--

40:52.150 --> 40:53.883
What would you say
if I told you

40:53.885 --> 40:56.486
That when I was...
When my body was in the I.C.U.,

40:56.488 --> 40:59.722
That part of me wandered
these halls?

40:59.724 --> 41:02.559
I talked to--
I talked to spirits.

41:02.561 --> 41:04.194
I talked to other coma patients.
I talked--

41:04.196 --> 41:06.062
Charlie--
I talked to dead people.

41:06.064 --> 41:07.797
Charlie.

41:07.799 --> 41:09.232
No. Uh, uh, I thought
I was dreaming.

41:09.234 --> 41:10.834
I thought--I thought
it was all in my head

41:10.836 --> 41:12.569
And I was gonna wake up,
but when I woke up...

41:12.571 --> 41:14.003
It's still happening.

41:14.005 --> 41:17.073
Charlie--
it's still happening.
It's still happening.

41:18.542 --> 41:22.011
I know that your brother
can hear you

41:22.013 --> 41:24.614
Because he's standing
right there.
Stop it.

41:24.616 --> 41:26.182
He's right there.

41:26.184 --> 41:27.484
Stop it!

41:27.486 --> 41:29.052
Alex...

41:29.054 --> 41:31.054
You can talk to him.

41:31.056 --> 41:33.923
You wanted to know
what's happening to me.

41:33.925 --> 41:35.492
I see ghosts.

41:35.494 --> 41:39.162
This is insane.

41:39.164 --> 41:40.930
(exhales)

41:42.666 --> 41:44.734
I feel like
I'm going crazy.

41:44.736 --> 41:46.903
No, no. You're not.

41:46.905 --> 41:48.771
(gasps)
don't--don't go.

42:27.945 --> 42:29.245
(kisses)

42:33.951 --> 42:36.753
(breath quavers
and exhales)

42:43.928 --> 42:46.129
(exhales)

42:59.777 --> 43:03.146
(screams)

43:05.049 --> 43:07.216
(gasps and sobs)
