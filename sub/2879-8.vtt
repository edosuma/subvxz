WEBVTT

00:03.642 --> 00:04.989
What are you drawing
over there?

00:04.990 --> 00:07.541
A hypothetical containment field

00:07.543 --> 00:09.593
for a Frisbee-sized wormhole

00:09.595 --> 00:12.663
that could serve as a portal
to a parallel universe.

00:12.665 --> 00:15.832
Oh, you silly doodlebug.

00:17.185 --> 00:18.685
You know,
a lot of scientists believe

00:18.687 --> 00:20.354
that making contact
with other life-forms

00:20.356 --> 00:22.306
would probably not
end well for us.

00:22.308 --> 00:24.691
It's a Frisbee-sized wormhole,
Leonard.

00:24.693 --> 00:26.276
You can block it with a Frisbee.

00:26.278 --> 00:27.528
Calm down.

00:30.732 --> 00:32.983
Do you expect me
to build this?

00:32.985 --> 00:35.619
I expect you to wipe the pudding
off your chin. Gentlemen.

00:38.123 --> 00:39.706
Have you guys ever noticed
that Sheldon

00:39.708 --> 00:42.376
always disappears every day
at 2:45?

00:42.378 --> 00:43.410
Really?

00:43.412 --> 00:44.745
He probably just goes
to the bathroom.

00:44.747 --> 00:46.196
Actually, no,
he goes to the bathroom

00:46.198 --> 00:47.915
at 8:00 a.m.
with optional follow-ups

00:47.917 --> 00:52.035
at 1:45 and 7:10
on high-fiber Fridays.

00:52.804 --> 00:54.671
It's sad that
you know that.

00:54.673 --> 00:57.841
Oh, that's just the tip
of the sadness iceberg.

00:58.726 --> 01:01.895
I'm looking
at his public calendar.

01:01.897 --> 01:05.098
2:45 to 3:05, nothing.

01:05.099 --> 01:07.401
Yesterday, 2:45 to 3:05,
nothing.

01:07.403 --> 01:08.936
Last week, nothing.

01:08.938 --> 01:10.087
Last month, nothing.

01:10.089 --> 01:12.823
He never has anything booked
during that time.

01:12.825 --> 01:15.859
20 minutes a day,
completely unaccounted for.

01:15.861 --> 01:17.895
We should figure out
where he goes.

01:17.897 --> 01:19.896
Ooh, this is exciting.

01:20.765 --> 01:21.832
Like one of my classic

01:21.834 --> 01:23.617
murder mystery
dinner parties.

01:23.619 --> 01:25.619
Right, the case of
who murdered

01:25.621 --> 01:27.621
three Saturday nights
of my life?

01:28.957 --> 01:30.457
Colonel Koothrapali
in ten

01:30.459 --> 01:32.676
with the olive spread.

01:33.962 --> 01:37.297

02:06.663 --> 02:07.930
So, how was work today?

02:07.931 --> 02:09.797
Well, I spent most
of the afternoon growing

02:09.799 --> 02:12.800
isotopically pure crystals
for neutrino detection.

02:14.586 --> 02:17.455
That sounds like fun.

02:17.457 --> 02:18.856
Yeah, it was.

02:18.858 --> 02:20.858
Oh, good, I guessed right.

02:22.696 --> 02:24.345
Who you talking to?

02:24.347 --> 02:26.114
Oh, just this guy
I met at school.

02:26.116 --> 02:29.016
Oh, great.
We're still dating, right?

02:29.018 --> 02:31.736
Relax. He's just a friend.

02:31.738 --> 02:33.071
We're doing
an oral report together.

02:33.073 --> 02:34.288
He's really nice.

02:34.290 --> 02:35.206
I'm sorry, what was that?

02:35.208 --> 02:37.742
I had a little stroke
after "oral."

02:37.744 --> 02:39.744
Would you stop?

02:40.830 --> 02:42.547
Look, he just moved here
from London, okay?

02:42.549 --> 02:43.698
He doesn't really know anybody.

02:43.700 --> 02:45.917
Oh, good, an English accent,

02:45.919 --> 02:47.368
the sexiest accent you can have.

02:47.370 --> 02:48.586
No.

02:48.588 --> 02:49.870
That's not true.

02:49.872 --> 02:52.557
There's French, there's Italian.

02:52.559 --> 02:55.543
No, you're right, it's the best.

02:55.545 --> 02:57.178
Did you tell him
you have a boyfriend?

02:57.180 --> 02:58.429
It didn't come up.

02:58.431 --> 03:00.148
Well, maybe you should tell him.

03:00.150 --> 03:01.933
What am I supposed to say?

03:01.935 --> 03:03.217
Say, "Can't talk right now.

03:03.219 --> 03:04.385
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

03:04.387 --> 03:06.721
England sucks, you suck,
USA number one."

03:10.693 --> 03:11.892
Fine.

03:11.894 --> 03:13.611
"Hanging with my boyfriend.

03:13.613 --> 03:15.530
Talk to you later."

03:15.532 --> 03:16.664
Happy?

03:16.666 --> 03:18.032
Yes. Thank you.
Mm-hmm.

03:24.373 --> 03:25.790
What did he say?

03:25.792 --> 03:27.241
Nothing.

03:27.243 --> 03:28.509
What?

03:28.511 --> 03:31.679
"Did your boyfriend make
you type that?"

03:38.721 --> 03:40.888
I hate this guy.

03:42.975 --> 03:46.093
Don't be like that.

03:46.095 --> 03:48.095
Come on, trust me,
he's hitting on you.

03:48.097 --> 03:49.363
No, he's not.
We're just friends.

03:49.365 --> 03:50.782
Look, is this gonna be
a problem?

03:50.784 --> 03:52.533
Because he's supposed
to come over tomorrow to work.

03:52.535 --> 03:54.368
Really? Here?

03:54.370 --> 03:56.437
If it makes you uncomfortable,
I'll switch partners,

03:56.439 --> 03:58.156
even though
the thing's due next week

03:58.158 --> 04:00.074
and everyone already
has a partner

04:00.076 --> 04:02.109
and I'll probably end up
failing the class.

04:02.111 --> 04:03.711
That'd be great. Thank you.

04:08.584 --> 04:10.468
2:44,
right on schedule.

04:10.470 --> 04:11.669
Hey, Sheldon.

04:11.671 --> 04:13.287
Oh, hello.

04:13.289 --> 04:15.456
Raj and I
are heading over

04:15.458 --> 04:18.426
to the genetics lab to pet
the glow-in-the-dark bunny.

04:19.178 --> 04:21.062
Want to come with us?
No, thank you.

04:21.064 --> 04:22.597
Are you sure? They
turn off the lights,

04:22.599 --> 04:23.981
and it's like a cute
little laser show

04:23.983 --> 04:26.184
that poops all
over the place.

04:26.186 --> 04:28.603
I'm quite sure. Good day.

04:28.605 --> 04:30.104
Well, where
are you going?

04:30.106 --> 04:31.656
Where are you going?
We just told you.

04:31.658 --> 04:33.357
I just told you.
No, you didn't.

04:33.359 --> 04:35.860
Well, it's your word against
mine; see you in court.

04:38.497 --> 04:41.082
Should we follow him?

04:41.084 --> 04:42.200
I don't know, I'm torn.

04:42.202 --> 04:43.417
I want to know
where he's going,

04:43.419 --> 04:45.837
but now I kind of want
to play with the bunny.

04:46.672 --> 04:48.673
Hi, guys.

04:48.675 --> 04:50.842
Hey, Alex, do you know
where your boss just went?

04:50.844 --> 04:51.709
No.

04:51.711 --> 04:52.827
Don't you know
his schedule?

04:52.829 --> 04:55.429
All I know is corduroy
makes too much noise

04:55.431 --> 04:57.632
and I have to go find
"quieter pants."

05:02.020 --> 05:03.437
Come on.

05:03.439 --> 05:05.306
Boy, what I wouldn't give

05:05.308 --> 05:07.892
to get her out of those pants...

05:07.894 --> 05:10.344
and into something
a little more stylish.

05:12.000 --> 05:18.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

05:24.910 --> 05:26.694
This is where
he goes?

05:26.696 --> 05:28.496
What's in there?

05:28.498 --> 05:30.081
I think it's
an old storage room.

05:30.083 --> 05:34.468
What could he be doing in there
every day for 20 minutes?

05:34.470 --> 05:36.420
Well, he's not doing
20-minute abs,

05:36.422 --> 05:39.640
because if he were,
he would have way better abs.

05:42.311 --> 05:44.395
Can you hear anything?

05:44.397 --> 05:46.848
Not yet.

05:58.327 --> 06:00.928
What are you doing?

06:00.930 --> 06:03.197
I'm listening.

06:03.199 --> 06:06.534
Can't you face the
other way and listen?

06:06.536 --> 06:09.570
I can't do anything right
for you, can I?

06:09.572 --> 06:11.806
What the hell
is he up to?

06:11.808 --> 06:14.425
He is kind of a weirdo.

06:14.427 --> 06:17.044
Maybe he's got Leonard Nimoy
chained up in there.

06:17.046 --> 06:18.462
Or Bill Gates.

06:18.464 --> 06:20.598
Or Stephen Hawking.

06:20.600 --> 06:24.802
Why would he chain
up Stephen Hawking?

06:24.804 --> 06:27.305
Howard, please, you can't treat
the man differently

06:27.307 --> 06:30.057
just because he's disabled.
That's not okay.

06:32.694 --> 06:35.262
If you're wondering why

06:35.264 --> 06:36.597
I've been staring
through the peephole,

06:36.599 --> 06:38.316
I'm trying to get a look
at this guy

06:38.318 --> 06:39.951
who's coming over to Penny's.

06:39.953 --> 06:44.038
To be honest,
I didn't know you were here.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.274
It's not a big deal.

06:46.276 --> 06:47.541
He's just in her history class.

06:47.543 --> 06:49.076
They're working
on a project together.

06:49.078 --> 06:50.578
I don't even know why I care.

06:50.580 --> 06:51.746
You know what, I don't care.

06:51.748 --> 06:54.348
You think <i>you</i> don't care.

06:54.350 --> 06:56.801
This is silly.

06:56.803 --> 06:59.003
I have nothing
to worry about.

06:59.005 --> 07:02.957
Oh, I don't know.

07:02.959 --> 07:04.225
Statistically speaking,

07:04.227 --> 07:06.410
I'm sure you have something
to worry about.

07:06.412 --> 07:08.128
What do you mean?

07:08.130 --> 07:12.099
Well, if we assume
your looks are average,

07:12.101 --> 07:13.801
right off the bat,

07:13.803 --> 07:16.938
50% of men on Earth
are more attractive than you.

07:19.074 --> 07:22.476
That's 1.5 billion
handsome lads standing by,

07:22.478 --> 07:24.912
waiting to rain on your parade.

07:24.914 --> 07:28.833
Well, yeah, but this
isn't just about looks.

07:28.835 --> 07:32.286
I'm way above average
in a lot of other things.

07:32.288 --> 07:34.288
Not height, vision, athleticism,

07:34.290 --> 07:37.825
or ability
to digest dairy products.

07:37.827 --> 07:40.160
I'm talking
about important things

07:40.162 --> 07:43.014
like emotional maturity.

07:43.016 --> 07:46.434
You were just spying on your
girlfriend through a peephole.

07:46.436 --> 07:49.503
I liked it better
when you thought I wasn't here.

07:49.505 --> 07:53.391
I'm not saying you don't
have attractive qualities.

07:53.393 --> 07:55.860
Your choice of friends
is impeccable,

07:55.862 --> 07:57.812
you're a good sleeper.

07:57.814 --> 07:59.814
And last but not least,

07:59.816 --> 08:03.401
you buy the grapes I like.

08:03.403 --> 08:05.703
You're a real catch

08:05.705 --> 08:07.488
compared to some snoring guy

08:07.490 --> 08:10.624
with a fridge full
of lousy grapes.

08:10.626 --> 08:12.793
None of this matters.

08:12.795 --> 08:14.545
I trust that Penny cares
about me,

08:14.547 --> 08:16.630
and nothing's gonna happen
with this guy.

08:16.632 --> 08:20.001
Well, unless of course
he's a skilled hypnotist.

08:20.003 --> 08:22.720
What?

08:22.722 --> 08:26.073
While unlikely, it's still
a statistical possibility.

08:26.075 --> 08:27.241
She might be performing

08:27.243 --> 08:31.262
sexual acts with him
and not even know it.

08:31.264 --> 08:34.381
Now you're just being
ridiculous.

08:34.383 --> 08:35.816
Am I?

08:35.818 --> 08:38.068
The mind's
a mysterious thing, Leonard.

08:38.071 --> 08:40.671
He could be having
the time of his life

08:40.673 --> 08:43.908
while she thinks she's
a chicken pecking for corn.

08:54.503 --> 08:57.571
Look at us, sneaking around
in the middle of the night

08:57.573 --> 09:01.292
like a couple
of cat burglars.

09:01.294 --> 09:03.177
I think we're more
like ninjas.

09:03.179 --> 09:06.413
I don't want to be a ninja;
I want to be a cat burglar.

09:06.415 --> 09:09.884
Fine, I'll be a ninja,
you be a cat burglar.

09:09.886 --> 09:12.019
No, we both have to
be the same thing.

09:14.089 --> 09:16.590
Okay, we're ninjas.

09:16.592 --> 09:18.142
Thank you.

09:18.144 --> 09:21.062
But next time, we'll
be cat burglars.

09:27.285 --> 09:29.320
It's locked.
Are you sure?

09:29.322 --> 09:31.822
Yes, I'm sure.

09:31.824 --> 09:33.774
Now, you stand guard,
I'm going to...

09:36.995 --> 09:40.164
It's locked.

09:40.166 --> 09:41.949
Just keep an eye out.

09:41.951 --> 09:43.801
I'll have this open
in a minute.

09:43.803 --> 09:45.970
When did you learn
how to pick locks?

09:45.972 --> 09:48.556
When I was starting to do magic
in junior high,

09:48.558 --> 09:51.592
I thought I could be
an escape artist

09:51.594 --> 09:53.394
like Harry Houdini.

09:53.396 --> 09:54.395
How did that work out?

09:54.397 --> 09:55.513
Pretty good.

09:55.515 --> 09:57.264
I managed to escape friends,
popularity,

09:57.266 --> 10:00.634
and every party thrown
in a 12-mile radius.

10:00.636 --> 10:02.736
There. Ready?

10:02.738 --> 10:04.522
Hold on, hold on.
What?

10:04.524 --> 10:06.690
Sheldon is a very smart man,

10:06.692 --> 10:08.943
and he obviously wants
to keep this a secret.

10:08.945 --> 10:10.027
Yeah, so?

10:10.029 --> 10:12.830
What if it's
booby-trapped?

10:12.832 --> 10:16.834
Don't worry, I'm one
step ahead of him.

10:16.836 --> 10:18.652
Great, what's your pl...

10:23.675 --> 10:25.176
Are we good?

10:25.178 --> 10:27.645
Yeah.

10:34.386 --> 10:36.003
Huh.

10:36.005 --> 10:37.721
Forty-three.

10:37.723 --> 10:40.674
What the hell
does that mean?

10:40.676 --> 10:42.026
I don't know.

10:42.028 --> 10:44.011
The solution to an equation?

10:44.013 --> 10:45.446
Maybe.

10:45.448 --> 10:46.981
It's a prime number.

10:46.983 --> 10:50.951
Encryption systems
are built on prime numbers.

10:50.953 --> 10:53.904
What kind of secret does
Sheldon have to encrypt?

10:53.906 --> 10:55.122
He's always been
very cagey

10:55.124 --> 10:57.158
about what he puts
in his egg salad

10:57.160 --> 11:00.327
to make it so tasty.

11:02.147 --> 11:05.499
It's paprika.

11:05.501 --> 11:06.917
Really?

11:06.919 --> 11:09.086
Well, okay, one mystery solved.

11:11.973 --> 11:13.657
Okay, good night.

11:13.659 --> 11:14.808
Thanks, Cole.

11:14.810 --> 11:15.809
See you at school.

11:15.811 --> 11:17.144
See you.

11:18.414 --> 11:20.814
I'll be right back.

11:20.816 --> 11:23.417
I thought you left
a long time ago.

11:33.111 --> 11:34.728
What's up?

11:34.730 --> 11:37.031
Hey.

11:37.033 --> 11:41.418
You moving into the apartment
on the fifth floor?

11:41.420 --> 11:44.071
No, I was just visiting
a friend.

11:44.073 --> 11:45.339
Oh, cool.

11:45.341 --> 11:46.707
That cute blonde on four?

11:46.709 --> 11:48.092
Yeah. You know her?

11:48.094 --> 11:49.960
I, well,
I see her around.

11:49.962 --> 11:52.096
I like to keep my distance

11:52.098 --> 11:55.766
because her boyfriend
is a pretty scary dude.

11:55.768 --> 11:57.301
Really?

11:57.303 --> 11:59.086
Yeah.

11:59.088 --> 12:02.256
He's ganged up.

12:02.258 --> 12:04.308
She told me
he's a scientist.

12:04.310 --> 12:07.695
That's the name of his gang.

12:08.546 --> 12:12.316
The Scientists.

12:12.318 --> 12:15.653
They are crazy.

12:15.655 --> 12:17.538
Well, thanks for the tip.

12:17.540 --> 12:20.107
No problem, brother.
Stay frosty.

12:32.120 --> 12:34.238
We're still dating, right?

12:47.091 --> 12:48.241
Oh, hello, Dr. Hofstadter.

12:48.243 --> 12:50.293
Hey, Alex,
and call me Leonard.

12:50.295 --> 12:51.812
Dr. Hofstadter is my father.

12:51.814 --> 12:53.330
And my mother.

12:54.348 --> 12:55.849
And my sister.

12:55.851 --> 12:58.685
And our cat.

12:59.887 --> 13:01.388
Although, I'm pretty sure

13:01.390 --> 13:04.808
Dr. Boots Hofstadter's degree
was honorary.

13:04.810 --> 13:07.427
May I join you, Leonard?

13:07.429 --> 13:09.279
Sure.
Thanks.

13:09.281 --> 13:11.698
Hey, Alex,
let me ask you something.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.484
My girlfriend
knows this guy at school.

13:14.486 --> 13:16.486
He's got an English accent.

13:16.488 --> 13:18.455
Ooh, I love English accents.

13:18.457 --> 13:21.241
Yeah, you all do.

13:21.243 --> 13:24.044
Anyway, I feel like
he's hitting on her.

13:24.046 --> 13:27.113
She says he's just being nice
and that I should trust her.

13:27.115 --> 13:28.665
It's probably harmless.

13:28.667 --> 13:29.833
You know how it is.

13:29.835 --> 13:32.803
I'm sure you get hit on
all the time.

13:33.638 --> 13:36.356
Right.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.258
Because girls are always like,

13:38.260 --> 13:40.343
"Ooh, that guy owns
two Star Trek uniforms

13:40.345 --> 13:42.012
"and gets a lot
of ear infections.

13:42.014 --> 13:44.764
I got to get me some of that."

13:44.766 --> 13:46.933
I don't know,

13:46.935 --> 13:48.652
I bet it happens
more than you realize.

13:48.654 --> 13:50.070
Trust me, it doesn't.

13:50.072 --> 13:51.605
You sure?

13:51.607 --> 13:53.490
You're cute, you're funny.

13:53.492 --> 13:58.111
Maybe you're getting hit on,
and you don't even know it.

13:58.113 --> 13:59.579
Really?

13:59.581 --> 14:03.200
I'm pretty sure.

14:08.923 --> 14:10.173
Okay, I got to get back to work.

14:10.175 --> 14:12.726
Thanks for listening.

14:12.728 --> 14:14.094
No problem.

14:14.096 --> 14:16.996
Hope-hope no girls rip my
clothes off on the way.

14:20.384 --> 14:23.570
Come on,
we're smart guys.

14:23.572 --> 14:25.505
We can figure this out.
Forty-three.

14:25.507 --> 14:28.108
What is 43?

14:28.110 --> 14:32.028
Besides my mom's neck size.

14:33.948 --> 14:36.483
It's the atomic number
for technetium.

14:36.485 --> 14:38.685
That stuff's radioactive.

14:38.687 --> 14:41.071
Do you think
he's building a bomb?

14:41.073 --> 14:42.989
It took him two years
to put together

14:42.991 --> 14:44.624
that Lego Death Star;
I'm not worried.

14:46.377 --> 14:49.095
Ooh, this could be something.

14:49.097 --> 14:51.464
43 is the number of calories

14:51.466 --> 14:55.168
in half a cup
of fat-free yogurt.

14:55.170 --> 14:57.671
Why would you know that?

14:57.673 --> 14:59.038
I'm sorry.

14:59.040 --> 15:02.609
We can't all eat whatever
we want and still stay thin.

15:06.214 --> 15:08.515
Wait, in the <i>Hitchhikers</i>
<i>Guide to the Galaxy,</i>

15:08.517 --> 15:10.350
isn't 43 the answer
to the question

15:10.352 --> 15:12.552
of life, the universe,
and everything?

15:12.554 --> 15:15.488
That's 42, dumb-ass.

15:15.490 --> 15:17.023
Hey, hey.

15:17.025 --> 15:19.276
Feelings.

15:19.278 --> 15:22.062
We should stop.

15:22.064 --> 15:24.030
I'm exhausted.
Yeah, me, too.

15:24.032 --> 15:25.599
We've got more
important things to do.

15:25.601 --> 15:27.400
Who cares what
stupid 43 means?

15:27.402 --> 15:29.569
Not me.
Let's go home.

15:31.372 --> 15:32.973
You want
to get something to eat?

15:32.975 --> 15:35.041
Sounds good.

15:36.910 --> 15:38.795
What the balls is 43?!

15:38.797 --> 15:40.931
I have to know!

15:45.269 --> 15:46.603
Hi.

15:46.605 --> 15:49.723
Hey, shouldn't you be out
with your gang,

15:49.725 --> 15:53.026
spray painting equations
on the side of buildings?

15:53.028 --> 15:55.862
Come on, I'm sorry.

15:55.864 --> 15:57.530
I just can't believe
you don't trust me.

15:57.532 --> 15:58.902
I do, of course I do.

15:58.927 --> 16:01.027
Then why did you embarrass me
in front of my friend,

16:01.069 --> 16:03.119
who, by the way,
knew exactly who you were?

16:03.121 --> 16:06.790
Really?
Your picture's on my refrigerator.

16:08.609 --> 16:10.126
Oh.

16:10.128 --> 16:13.330
You know, I'm really starting
to not like this guy.

16:13.332 --> 16:14.947
What is your problem?

16:14.949 --> 16:16.883
Do you use up
all your thinking at work

16:16.885 --> 16:19.002
and then have none left over
for when you get home?

16:19.004 --> 16:20.553
I don't know.

16:20.555 --> 16:23.122
It's hard sometimes.

16:23.124 --> 16:24.474
Everywhere you go,

16:24.476 --> 16:27.394
guys hit on you, even if
I'm standing right there.

16:27.396 --> 16:28.595
And they're all taller than me.

16:28.597 --> 16:31.181
Why is everyone taller
than me?

16:31.183 --> 16:33.099
You know what,

16:33.101 --> 16:34.684
this is all in my head.

16:34.686 --> 16:36.519
It's my problem, not yours.

16:36.521 --> 16:38.071
Leonard, why do you
always do this?

16:38.073 --> 16:39.823
Listen to me,
you're the one I'm with.

16:39.825 --> 16:42.158
You know I love you,
so will you please relax

16:42.160 --> 16:43.994
because you're driving me crazy.

16:50.925 --> 16:53.894
You know that's the first time
you ever said that you love me.

16:55.680 --> 16:57.881
Yeah.

17:00.885 --> 17:04.538
We're just supposed to
pretend it's not a big deal?

17:06.473 --> 17:09.076
That's...

17:09.078 --> 17:12.811
exactly what we're gonna do
because...

17:12.814 --> 17:15.115
you're about to make me cry,

17:15.117 --> 17:18.035
and we both know
if I start crying,

17:18.037 --> 17:21.488
you're gonna start crying.

17:21.490 --> 17:23.924
You're right, you should go.

17:23.925 --> 17:26.042
All right.

17:32.717 --> 17:35.001
She loves me.

17:39.023 --> 17:40.941
"Hey, it's Alex.

17:40.943 --> 17:42.259
"Nice having coffee with you.

17:42.261 --> 17:44.161
"If you want to talk more,
I'm always available.

17:44.163 --> 17:46.146
Smiley face, smiley face."

17:46.148 --> 17:48.348
What a friendly girl.

17:53.054 --> 17:55.238
Okay, picture's up.

17:55.240 --> 17:56.990
Looks like the camera's working.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.458
That's good quality video.

17:58.460 --> 18:01.778
It better be. It's the spare
camera for the Mars rover.

18:01.780 --> 18:04.081
How did you get
your hands on that?

18:04.083 --> 18:05.832
Million dollar camera--

18:05.834 --> 18:07.801
ten dollar lock.

18:08.753 --> 18:10.837
Oh, my God,
here he comes.

18:10.839 --> 18:12.723
This is it.

18:21.182 --> 18:22.816
What the hell
is that thing?

18:22.818 --> 18:24.000
I don't know.

18:24.002 --> 18:25.552
This is Dr. Sheldon Cooper.

18:25.554 --> 18:27.504
Experimental log.

18:27.506 --> 18:32.275
Wormhole generator test 44.

18:32.277 --> 18:35.278
Wormhole generator test?

18:38.332 --> 18:41.451
The first 43 parallel universes

18:41.453 --> 18:44.704
I've checked proved to be empty.

18:44.706 --> 18:46.373
I see no reason to suspect

18:46.375 --> 18:49.626
universe number 44
will be any different.

18:55.266 --> 18:57.083
Oh, my God!

18:57.085 --> 18:59.919
Holy crap!

19:05.526 --> 19:08.311
Oh! It's eating my face!

19:08.313 --> 19:09.946
Aah! It's eating his face!

19:16.442 --> 19:18.794
I found your Webcam
and replaced the video feed.

19:18.796 --> 19:21.330
You two should be ashamed
of yourselves.

19:21.332 --> 19:23.015
Sheldon, we're really sorry.

19:23.017 --> 19:24.300
Yeah, really sorry.

19:24.302 --> 19:25.534
Sorry?

19:25.536 --> 19:26.919
You may not realize it,

19:26.921 --> 19:30.472
but I have difficulty navigating
certain aspects of daily life.

19:30.474 --> 19:33.258
You know,
understanding sarcasm,

19:33.260 --> 19:34.760
feigning interest in others,

19:34.762 --> 19:38.731
not talking about trains
as much as I want to.

19:38.733 --> 19:40.316
It's exhausting.

19:40.318 --> 19:42.901
Which is why,
for 20 minutes a day,

19:42.903 --> 19:44.687
I like to go down to that room,

19:44.689 --> 19:45.971
turn my mind off

19:45.973 --> 19:48.390
and do what I need to do
to recharge.

19:48.392 --> 19:51.476
But what are you doing in there?

19:51.478 --> 19:53.145
And what does 43 mean?

19:53.147 --> 19:54.546
You don't need to know,

19:54.548 --> 19:56.081
you don't deserve to know,

19:56.083 --> 19:58.250
and you will never know.

20:49.032 --> 20:52.334
One, two, three, four,

20:52.336 --> 20:56.222
five, six, seven, eight...

20:56.251 --> 20:59.219
Drat.

21:00.447 --> 21:02.664
I'm never going to get
to 43 again.

21:04.661 --> 21:06.969
One, two, three, four...

21:07.605 --> 21:08.897
Rats.
