Feels sort of repeatish.

No, I'm talking
about graduation.

00:12.813 --> 00:14.680
I get to wear a gown!
How cool is that?

You're excited about
wearing a gown?

00:17.084 --> 00:18.217
Care to explain?

00:18.219 --> 00:19.852
No chance I'll be
losing my pants

00:19.854 --> 00:22.654
in front of the whole school.

00:23.124 --> 00:28.193

to wear pants underneath.

00:40.107 --> 00:42.241
Are you guessing, or did
you just look at my notes?

00:42.243 --> 00:45.677
You know, I could have stolen
something actually dangerous.

00:45.679 --> 00:48.080
But, no, no.
You had to be creative.

00:48.082 --> 00:50.182
This time I win, Shego.

And zowie is good?

01:10.671 --> 01:13.172
So, the pants under
the gown thing.

01:13.174 --> 01:15.641
Is that, like,
a rule or a guideline?

01:15.643 --> 01:17.142

Um, I'd say marigold.

10:57.790 --> 11:00.325
So, you two still...

11:00.327 --> 11:03.294
Really? Sure the lass
isn't tired

11:03.296 --> 11:05.230
of your pants-losing
antics by now?

11:05.232 --> 11:09.768
Ok, ok! Don't go all
William Wallace on me.

11:09.770 --> 11:10.635
I was just asking.

11:10.637 --> 11:14.339
Well, don't be asking.

11:14.875 --> 11:18.209
Wade: Still having
trouble with communication.

11:18.211 --> 11:20.311
Got you first class.
And we appreciate it.

11:20.313 --> 11:22.447
Catch you stateside.
[Gasps]

11:23.582 --> 11:25.517
Rufus: Hmm?

11:34.326 --> 11:37.295
[Sniffs] Oh.
Didn't need to see that.

11:37.297 --> 11:39.197
Ron? Do you have change?

11:39.199 --> 11:40.465
No, I do not have change!

11:40.467 --> 11:42.801
Change is bad! Why do
we even need change?

11:42.803 --> 11:44.369
For a newspaper.

11:44.371 --> 11:46.204
Oh.

11:46.338 --> 11:47.639
It's not just golf courses.

11:47.641 --> 11:50.975
It's parks, it's farms, it's...
Weird.

11:50.977 --> 11:56.881
Uh, Kim, are my pants
currently on my body?

11:56.883 --> 11:59.317
It's the girl in the magazine.

11:59.319 --> 12:00.351
[Indistinct chatter]

12:00.353 --> 12:03.555
I think they're staring at me.

12:03.557 --> 12:04.889
Oh, I see.

12:04.891 --> 12:07.726
They think you look like
that girl on the magazine.

12:07.728 --> 12:10.361
[Gasps] I am that girl.

12:10.363 --> 12:12.330
My graduation is a cover story?

12:12.332 --> 12:15.433
See? See? I'm already
out of the picture!

12:15.435 --> 12:18.570
Barkin's voice:
Center will not hold!

12:18.572 --> 12:20.972
I don't even know
what that means,

12:20.974 --> 12:23.908
but I know it's a bad thing.

12:23.910 --> 12:26.144
[Bell ringing]

12:29.282 --> 12:31.883
Possible, locker
belongs to the school.

12:31.885 --> 12:33.318
This belongs to you.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.385
I tried to stop him, Kim!

12:34.387 --> 12:36.020
He's right.
Time to move on.

12:36.022 --> 12:39.357
I ruled out Drakken. He's
between lairs right now.

12:39.359 --> 12:43.328
Can you believe it? G-day is here.
We're actually graduating!

12:43.330 --> 12:44.662
It all seems so final.

12:44.664 --> 12:45.897
Starting a whole new chapter.

12:45.899 --> 12:48.333
Right! No more Barkin,
no more school bell,

12:48.335 --> 12:49.434
no more mystery meat.

12:49.436 --> 12:52.370
Oh, hey, tar.
Sign me, girlfriend!

12:52.372 --> 12:54.606
Well, if it isn't
miss cover story.

12:54.608 --> 12:55.573
Props on the pic.

12:55.575 --> 12:56.941
Oh. Well, thanks, B.

12:56.943 --> 12:59.744
Uh-oh.
Is that a ladybug?

12:59.746 --> 13:01.412
Or a zit on your chin?

13:01.414 --> 13:05.383
Some things about high
school will not be missed.

13:05.385 --> 13:06.918
Thanks to his recent lotto win,

13:06.920 --> 13:09.988
Mr. Lesteppe has
resigned abruptly, so...

13:09.990 --> 13:13.825
Looks like I'll be overseeing
your last hour of high school.

13:13.827 --> 13:16.895
Aw, man. Even on the last
day I get Barkin.

13:16.897 --> 13:20.298
Felix! Hey,
how's our valedictorian?

13:20.300 --> 13:24.035
I'm hoping Kim might say a
few words at the big G.

13:24.037 --> 13:25.303
What? Oh, me?

13:25.305 --> 13:27.472
Oh, come on.
You're a rock star!

13:27.474 --> 13:30.041
Oh, well. I guess.

13:30.810 --> 13:33.745
[Sighs] Playing with
the lights, Stoppable?

13:33.747 --> 13:38.383
Is this your idea
of a senior prank?

13:38.385 --> 13:41.319
This isn't kindergarten,
people!

13:41.321 --> 13:43.388
Until the big hand
is on the 12,

13:43.390 --> 13:48.326
you will observe the final moments
of your high school career

13:48.328 --> 13:50.328
with honor and quiet dignity!

13:50.330 --> 13:53.431
Yeah, but...
quiet dignity!

14:09.081 --> 14:11.416
Well, that was
anti-climatic.

14:11.418 --> 14:15.353
Uh, rrrrring!

14:15.355 --> 14:17.055
[Cheering]

14:17.057 --> 14:21.993
Oh, every year! It's like opening
a barrel of rabid monkeys.

14:21.995 --> 14:23.728
Yes!
Whoo-hoo!

14:23.730 --> 14:25.129
Out of here!
Yeah!

14:25.131 --> 14:27.031
I did it!

14:27.033 --> 14:30.101
Ron: So long,
Middleton high.

14:30.103 --> 14:32.070
See?

14:32.072 --> 14:35.373
So not the end of the world.

14:36.942 --> 14:38.610
Woman: Surprise!

14:38.612 --> 14:42.080
Oh! I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

14:42.082 --> 14:44.849
Oh, and I hear
you're speaking, too.

14:44.851 --> 14:46.417
No big.
Just a few words.

14:46.419 --> 14:49.621
Living so far away,
oh, I miss you.

14:49.623 --> 14:53.591
I do too, Nana. It's awful to
be far from somebody you love.

14:53.593 --> 14:55.026
More college acceptances.

14:55.028 --> 14:57.128
Hong Kong. Whoo, dang!
That's far.

14:57.130 --> 14:59.731
Check it out!
We've reached orbit!

14:59.733 --> 15:02.100
Yeah! We can totally
watch Kim's speech

15:02.102 --> 15:05.503
or you can watch it
from the rock-hard bleachers

15:05.505 --> 15:07.538
like the rest of us.

15:37.469 --> 15:39.671
A-booyah.

15:52.051 --> 15:53.451
What?

15:53.453 --> 15:54.619
[Beeping]

15:54.621 --> 15:56.521
It cannot be!

15:56.989 --> 15:58.823
[Cell phone rings] Hello?

15:58.825 --> 16:00.758
Hi there, chen.
What's that?

16:00.760 --> 16:03.594
There's too much static,
I can't...

16:05.131 --> 16:07.832
bum connection. I'm sure
chen will ring back.

16:07.834 --> 16:10.668
Now, let's get you
graduated, young lady.

16:10.670 --> 16:11.836
Yee-haw!

16:11.838 --> 16:13.905
Oh, this is so exciting!

16:13.907 --> 16:18.776
Ok, future. I'm ready for
anything you throw at me.

16:33.058 --> 16:34.993
Drakken: Ok, Shego.
How 'bout now?

16:34.995 --> 16:37.061
Nope. They're back.

16:37.063 --> 16:38.997
[Growls]

16:38.999 --> 16:41.532
Ok, what about now?

16:41.534 --> 16:42.967
Back and brighter.

16:42.969 --> 16:45.803
Face it. Your
flower bazooka...

16:45.805 --> 16:46.904
super high pollinator!

16:46.906 --> 16:50.141
I call it
abject failure. Again.

16:50.143 --> 16:52.143
Ooh!

16:53.880 --> 16:57.181
Why don't you start
unpacking the lair, hmm?

16:57.183 --> 17:00.985
Um, note the beach chair?
I'm unpacked.

17:01.353 --> 17:03.221
Aah!

17:05.124 --> 17:08.026
Shego! Need light!

17:08.028 --> 17:09.627
Much better, thank you.

17:09.629 --> 17:11.629
Uh, wasn't me.

17:14.867 --> 17:16.868
Drakken: Oh, boy.

17:16.870 --> 17:19.270
That's a big light.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.910
Aah! Sensei?

17:25.912 --> 17:26.844
Stoppable-San.

17:26.846 --> 17:29.714
You never pop in like
this with good news.

17:29.716 --> 17:32.150
Indeed. There have
been disturbing signs.

17:32.152 --> 17:35.019
I sense you will soon face
your greatest challenge.

17:35.021 --> 17:36.187
Oh, tell me about it!

17:36.189 --> 17:38.823
You... hey, hey.
Have you heard of this

17:38.825 --> 17:40.058
"center will not hold" thing?

17:40.060 --> 17:42.160
Wha... what is that,
and why am I so scared of it?

17:42.162 --> 17:45.196
You have the ferocity of
the ancients within you.

17:45.198 --> 17:49.000
Yeah, great. Now if only the
college admissions people

17:49.002 --> 17:51.135
were looking for
intermittant monkey power.

17:51.137 --> 17:54.906
Your mystical skills will
blossom in adversity.

17:54.908 --> 17:58.776
Blossom? Wait, oh, ok. This is
about Drakken's flower plot.

17:58.778 --> 18:00.078
Yeah, been there.
Foiled that.

18:00.080 --> 18:03.314
The future, by the way,
is scarier than any villian.

18:03.316 --> 18:05.917
Yes. The only
constant is change.

18:05.919 --> 18:08.719
Well, I know that. And you
know, I don't like it one bit!

18:08.721 --> 18:11.756
You will soon discover,
Stoppable-San, you are...

18:11.758 --> 18:13.091
going to be late?

18:13.093 --> 18:14.192
Ready.

18:14.194 --> 18:16.928
Eh. As I'll ever be.

18:16.930 --> 18:19.597
I guess.

18:22.935 --> 18:24.836
Well, K.P., this is it.

18:24.838 --> 18:29.107
Yep. The big G. Heh.
The old diploma stroll.

18:30.777 --> 18:32.009
It's the...

I got it.

18:33.913 --> 18:36.147
Right.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.120
Look, Kim. I don't
know what's gonna happen...

18:42.122 --> 18:45.156
no, not the power.
What I'm saying is,

18:45.158 --> 18:49.193
after graduation, you're... you're
headed to the stars,

18:49.195 --> 18:51.162
and, um...

18:51.164 --> 18:52.930
Ron? What?

18:52.932 --> 18:57.034
But I don't wanna hold you back.
So whatever happens,

Welcome, graduating seniors.

19:51.291 --> 19:56.460

19:59.032 --> 20:00.097
What did you say, Kim?

20:00.099 --> 20:02.033
I, um, have a confession
to make.

20:02.035 --> 20:06.938
Felix: And now,
Kim Possible!

20:12.211 --> 20:14.045

we can do anything!

[Cheering]

20:21.086 --> 20:22.420
This is very bad, Shego.

20:22.422 --> 20:24.488
You think? Yeah,
a giant blinking beacon

20:24.490 --> 20:27.091
is not exactly the way to
keep a secret lair secret.

20:27.093 --> 20:31.329
Hmm. Maybe we could cover it.
We'll need a very large throw.

20:31.331 --> 20:32.396
I'll call mother.

20:32.398 --> 20:35.466
The woman can knit
like a fiend!

Aah!

20:40.239 --> 20:43.841
[Clears throat] As I
stand before you tonight,

20:43.843 --> 20:45.076
I see the faces of friends.

20:45.078 --> 20:48.112
Friends who've become
an extended family.

20:48.114 --> 20:49.380
And like all families,

20:49.382 --> 20:51.382
we have had our ups and downs.

20:51.384 --> 20:53.351
But we will rise above our fear

20:53.353 --> 20:56.520
of the unknown road
that lies ahead...

20:57.222 --> 20:59.790
Knowing that it's not
the end of the world.

Run, people!
It's the end of the world!

21:29.087 --> 21:33.924
Oh, am I the only one
who saw this coming?!

21:35.193 --> 21:39.130
Well, well, well. Even
captivity can have an upside,

21:39.132 --> 21:41.532
to see Kim Possible helpless.

Where are we?

Hmm. You look familiar.

Have we met?

and the girl one
who defeated me.
