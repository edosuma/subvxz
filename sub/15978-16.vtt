WEBVTT

00:01.769 --> 00:04.172
It's currently seven degrees
in Leesburg

00:04.205 --> 00:05.739
and most people
are bundled up inside...

00:05.773 --> 00:07.508
except for one plucky lady

00:07.541 --> 00:10.378
who's dressed up as
a Confederate soldier.

00:10.411 --> 00:13.381
Uh, ma'am, I think the question
on everyone's mind is:

00:13.414 --> 00:16.050
"What the heck
are you doing out here?"

00:16.084 --> 00:18.119
I'm helping my jackass husband
with his stupid hobby.

00:18.152 --> 00:20.088
Stop talking, Carla.
I'm doing the mouth.

00:20.121 --> 00:22.723
And, um... sir, what is it
that you're doing?

00:22.756 --> 00:25.393
Re-creating the Battle
of Ball's Bluff in ice.

00:25.426 --> 00:26.694
Carla, don't slouch.

00:26.727 --> 00:27.895
You're supposed to look heroic.

00:27.928 --> 00:30.698
I should've never bought you
that Civil War book, Harris!

00:30.731 --> 00:31.799
It's freezing out here!

00:31.832 --> 00:33.534
I'm going inside.

00:33.567 --> 00:35.069
Don't you dare get warm!

00:35.103 --> 00:36.137
You look different
when you're warm!

00:37.571 --> 00:38.572
And... cut.

00:38.606 --> 00:40.074
(sighs)

00:40.108 --> 00:41.775
This sculpture's
giving me the creeps.

00:41.809 --> 00:43.677
Wipe that racist
grin off your face!

00:43.711 --> 00:45.813
You lost the war,
I have the right to vote,

00:45.846 --> 00:49.750
and my truck has 30-inch
rims on it, bitch!

00:49.783 --> 00:52.586
Man, it is
freezing out here.

00:52.620 --> 00:53.821
It won't be on
that tropical island

00:53.854 --> 00:54.855
we're flying to
tomorrow morning.

00:54.888 --> 00:55.856
Are you pumped?

00:55.889 --> 00:57.558
I am excited. I just...

00:57.591 --> 00:59.627
I don't know what to expect
on a tropical island.

00:59.660 --> 01:01.629
Growing up, my mom
used to make us

01:01.662 --> 01:04.532
take educational vacations
based on historical figures.

01:04.565 --> 01:06.434
One year,
we did Lewis and Clark.

01:06.467 --> 01:08.702
Not the cool one, where they
made it to the Pacific.

01:08.736 --> 01:11.405
The one where they got lost
in Iowa and had to turn back.

01:13.241 --> 01:15.343
Well, this is gonna be
different. We're gonna have

01:15.376 --> 01:16.577
some of this right here
going on.

01:17.778 --> 01:20.148
A little bit of this
right here. (laughs)

01:20.181 --> 01:21.615
And a whole lot of
that right there.

01:21.649 --> 01:22.883
Yeah. Yeah.
How about this?

01:22.916 --> 01:25.253
Huh? Bit of this,
and this, and this...

01:25.286 --> 01:27.888
(screams)
My foot!

01:27.921 --> 01:29.323
Ow, my foot!

01:29.357 --> 01:31.192
Damn it, my foot!
Oh, man,
I'm so sorry.

01:31.225 --> 01:33.294
I wasn't looking
when I backed my thing up.

01:33.327 --> 01:34.895
Get it off!

01:34.928 --> 01:37.698
It took you 150 years,
but you got me.

01:37.731 --> 01:39.167
You finally got me!

01:39.200 --> 01:41.202
Get that white man
off my foot!

02:08.296 --> 02:10.564
Why me?

02:10.598 --> 02:12.600
I had my boarding pass
all printed out.

02:12.633 --> 02:13.867
I was A-1.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.937
The only other people who were
boarding that plane before me

02:16.970 --> 02:18.739
were parents traveling
with small children,

02:18.772 --> 02:20.674
the disabled,
Platinum Preferred,

02:20.708 --> 02:22.676
first class, active military,

02:22.710 --> 02:24.312
and then me.

02:25.946 --> 02:28.482
Ray, I'm gonna do for you
what I always did for Nathan

02:28.516 --> 02:29.550
any time he was
sick or injured.

02:29.583 --> 02:31.852
I'm gonna get you some
chocolate mint ice cream,

02:31.885 --> 02:36.590
rent Goonies, and let you try on
any of my hats that you want.

02:38.659 --> 02:39.793
(groans softly)

02:39.827 --> 02:41.495
Well, this sucks.

02:41.529 --> 02:44.265
But it does open up my week
and give me a chance

02:44.298 --> 02:47.601
to get my car detailed,
get my eyebrows sculpted.

02:47.635 --> 02:48.936
Wait a second.

02:48.969 --> 02:50.604
You're not going?

02:50.638 --> 02:51.839
Oh, not without you, man.

02:51.872 --> 02:53.674
I mean, I didn't want
to say anything before,

02:53.707 --> 02:55.476
'cause you were so gung ho,
but I'm not really

02:55.509 --> 02:57.345
a "sit on the beach,
do nothing" kind of guy.

02:57.378 --> 03:00.681
Nathan... I'm not gonna
make it to that island.

03:00.714 --> 03:02.216
You're gonna have
to go without me.

03:02.250 --> 03:04.452
So that all these months
of searching the Internet,

03:04.485 --> 03:06.420
looking for "best
vacation destinations,

03:06.454 --> 03:08.689
comma, single men,
comma, not gay,"

03:08.722 --> 03:09.823
weren't for nothing!

03:09.857 --> 03:13.961
Get your ass on that island
and jump in the conga line!

03:13.994 --> 03:16.630
Look, man, conga lines
seem so silly.

03:16.664 --> 03:18.632
Oh, oh, yes, yes,
silly from the outside,

03:18.666 --> 03:19.900
but from the inside,

03:19.933 --> 03:21.902
they're glorious.
Like Hummer limos,

03:21.935 --> 03:24.372
and the parachute game
where you go underneath,

03:24.405 --> 03:26.707
and you're like, "Ooh...!"

03:26.740 --> 03:28.676
*

03:30.511 --> 03:32.446
Look at all this
stuff Grandma sent.

03:32.480 --> 03:33.614
Which grandma?

03:33.647 --> 03:35.616
The weird one.

03:35.649 --> 03:37.418
The weirder one.

03:37.451 --> 03:39.553
(chuckles):
Aw.mom sent these?

03:39.587 --> 03:41.722
Oh, look,
it's all my old childhood stuff

03:41.755 --> 03:42.723
from the commune.

03:42.756 --> 03:44.858
Man, if this blanket could talk.

03:44.892 --> 03:46.627
What would it say?

03:46.660 --> 03:48.729
I have no idea,
but how cool would that be?

03:48.762 --> 03:50.431
A talking blanket?

03:50.464 --> 03:53.033
What are these, old phones?

03:53.066 --> 03:55.636
They used to be so big.
(laughs)

03:55.669 --> 03:57.705
Sweetie, these are videotapes.

03:57.738 --> 03:59.573
See, we didn't have cable TV
on the commune,

03:59.607 --> 04:02.510
so my Uncle Phil used to send me
tapes of my favorite show,

04:02.543 --> 04:03.744
Walker, Texas Ranger.

04:03.777 --> 04:07.881
"Hey, how come you use your
sheets but you never use me?"

04:07.915 --> 04:10.017
That's what
my blanket would say.

04:10.050 --> 04:12.886
I get sweaty at night.

04:12.920 --> 04:15.055
Okay, can we
at least get rid of this?

04:15.088 --> 04:17.491
Whoa, are you kidding?
That's my old
letterman's jacket.

04:17.525 --> 04:19.493
It looks like a grain sack.

04:19.527 --> 04:21.529
(chuckles):
It is.

04:21.562 --> 04:24.432
Except for the sleeves.
See, this one's made

04:24.465 --> 04:26.834
out of pleather, and this one's
made out of plalligator.

04:28.569 --> 04:29.970
You know, Deb,
when I was young,

04:30.003 --> 04:31.605
I always dreamed
of someday asking

04:31.639 --> 04:33.674
a beautiful girl
to wear my jacket.

04:33.707 --> 04:35.643
Aw. Sweetie, I'd be honored.

04:36.677 --> 04:38.412
TOM:
"Tom...

04:38.446 --> 04:40.881
please don't put me
between your knees."

04:40.914 --> 04:43.050
That's what my pillow would say.

04:43.083 --> 04:45.285
(Tom laughing)

04:48.456 --> 04:50.658
(conga music playing)

04:55.496 --> 04:57.765
Get your ass in that
conga line, Nate!

04:57.798 --> 04:59.800
That's right--
I'm in your head.

04:59.833 --> 05:03.671
Now step aboard that
booty train. Whoo-whoo!

05:03.704 --> 05:04.838
Yo.

05:04.872 --> 05:06.073
Yeah, got this.

05:06.106 --> 05:07.475
All right! Yeah.

05:07.508 --> 05:08.909
This is great.
Oh, I'm psyched.

05:08.942 --> 05:10.711
Now I'm psyched.
I'm so pumped.

05:10.744 --> 05:11.812
No, I'm faking it!

05:11.845 --> 05:13.447
Sorry. It's not you; it's me.

05:13.481 --> 05:16.517
It's just, I think
I just need to be drunk first.

05:16.550 --> 05:18.486
*

05:18.519 --> 05:19.787
Oh. I didn't order that.

05:19.820 --> 05:21.689
It's from the lady at
that table over there.

05:21.722 --> 05:23.757
Oh.

05:26.527 --> 05:27.961
Is that milk?

05:27.995 --> 05:29.563
(laughing):
Yes, sir.

05:29.597 --> 05:31.765
And it's from that
lady over there.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.735
Surprise!

05:34.768 --> 05:37.037
Ray sold me his ticket!

05:37.070 --> 05:40.107
Sorry, man.
I needed the money.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.748
Oh, this can't be happening.

05:47.781 --> 05:50.117
You're supposed to be at home
taking care of Ray.

05:50.150 --> 05:52.085
He's fine.
He's staying at Debbie's.

05:52.119 --> 05:53.754
These resorts
are so expensive,

05:53.787 --> 05:56.624
I packed enough food
to last us three days.

05:56.657 --> 05:58.859
Do you want egg salad
or turkey?

05:58.892 --> 05:59.860
(sniffs)

05:59.893 --> 06:02.730
I'll take the turkey.

06:02.763 --> 06:04.131
These tickets can't
be transferable.

06:04.164 --> 06:06.467
They specifically say
"nontransferable."

06:06.500 --> 06:08.502
I know, but I added two arches,

06:08.536 --> 06:10.738
so it says "mom-transferable."

06:10.771 --> 06:15.909
The agent thought it was so cute
that he let it slide.

06:15.943 --> 06:17.478
Yeah, and just like that,

06:17.511 --> 06:19.880
I don't feel guilty
about breaking Ray's toe.

06:19.913 --> 06:22.716
Buh-buh-buh-buh. Let me
get my black light first.
What?

06:22.750 --> 06:26.186
I read that hotel furniture
can be unsavory.

06:26.219 --> 06:31.124
Whew, boy! Looks like we had
some spring breakers in here.

06:31.158 --> 06:34.462
Based on the pattern, there
were two guys, here and here.

06:34.495 --> 06:35.829
There was a girl.

06:35.863 --> 06:37.798
A natural redhead.

06:37.831 --> 06:40.167
Okay, listen... as much
as I'd love to stand here

06:40.200 --> 06:41.969
and listen to my mom
graphically describe

06:42.002 --> 06:44.905
an orgy, I'm gonna grab my
stuff and go to the beach.

06:44.938 --> 06:47.741
Are you sure you don't
want to take a quick catnap

06:47.775 --> 06:49.843
to adjust to the
new time zone?

06:49.877 --> 06:51.812
It's an hour difference.

06:51.845 --> 06:54.448
Yeah, it's gonna be tough
watching Jeopardy! at 6:00.

06:54.482 --> 06:55.849
When it's on closer to bedtime,

06:55.883 --> 06:58.786
I have a better chance
of dreaming about Alex Trebek.

06:58.819 --> 07:01.121
What kind of dreams are you
having about Alex Trebek?

07:01.154 --> 07:04.692
Mostly we solve crimes, but...
every once in a blue moon,

07:04.725 --> 07:07.027
we end up naked
on a double-decker bus.

07:08.696 --> 07:10.964
Let's take that nap while that's
still fresh in my mind.

07:10.998 --> 07:13.934
No, listen, Mom,
we're on a tropical island.

07:13.967 --> 07:15.869
I came here to relax, and
that's what I'm gonna do.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.871
So I'm not gonna
sit in my hotel room

07:17.905 --> 07:19.707
eating egg salad sandwiches
and watching Jeopardy!,

07:19.740 --> 07:21.775
and I'm damn sure
not taking a nap.

07:21.809 --> 07:24.778
Really? You sure do sound
like a boy who needs a nap.

07:24.812 --> 07:26.780
I don't need a nap,
I don't want a nap,

07:26.814 --> 07:28.682
and I'm not taking a nap!

07:28.716 --> 07:30.718
He needs a nap.

07:31.852 --> 07:33.821
*

07:33.854 --> 07:36.724
Well, Mom made it there okay.

07:36.757 --> 07:39.627
Nathan sounded cranky, but
he probably just needed a nap.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.962
Nah, it looks better
the other way.

07:42.863 --> 07:44.598
TOM:
Hey, what's going on?

07:44.632 --> 07:46.066
Who taped over Walker?

07:46.099 --> 07:48.168
Wait, Adam, is that you?

07:48.201 --> 07:50.938
Uh... yes, it is.
Who has the remote?

07:50.971 --> 07:52.973
Hey, Sierra.
I know you said

07:53.006 --> 07:55.943
you're not interested, but...
I love you.

07:55.976 --> 07:57.978
A-And I'm not just saying that
'cause you're the only girl

07:58.011 --> 08:00.881
in the commune not claimed
by our exalted leader Jeff.

08:00.914 --> 08:03.951
So since you won't meet me
in the relationship tepee...

08:03.984 --> 08:05.886
I wrote you a love song.

08:05.919 --> 08:07.688
Okay, seriously,
who has the remote?

08:07.721 --> 08:08.889
Nobody wants to see this.

08:08.922 --> 08:10.991
Oh, no, let it play.
Are you kidding?

08:11.024 --> 08:12.960
I'm pretty sure
everyone wants to see this.
RAY: Yeah.

08:15.062 --> 08:18.999
* I asked you to senior prom

08:19.032 --> 08:22.269
* You turned me down,
so I took my mom *

08:23.737 --> 08:26.106
* Now I feel like a buffoon

08:26.139 --> 08:28.141
* So I fly back

08:28.175 --> 08:29.843
* To my

08:29.877 --> 08:31.812
* Cocoon...

08:31.845 --> 08:35.215
(laughs)
Ray, we have to mail this tape
to the YouTube.

08:35.248 --> 08:37.317
(chuckling)

08:37.350 --> 08:38.786
(guitar strumming)

08:38.819 --> 08:42.322
* I want to stand
and spread my wings *

08:42.355 --> 08:44.291
* And fly you out

08:44.324 --> 08:46.326
* To Saturn's rings

08:46.359 --> 08:48.295
* Instead I sadly

08:48.328 --> 08:50.297
* Flutter by

08:50.330 --> 08:53.000
* And cry the tears

08:53.033 --> 08:55.302
* Of a but... ter...

08:55.335 --> 08:57.638
* Fly.

08:57.671 --> 08:59.640
(guitar strumming)

08:59.673 --> 09:00.674
(song ends)

09:00.708 --> 09:03.644
Daddy, you were
really crying.

09:04.678 --> 09:07.080
Why were you so sad?

09:07.114 --> 09:10.050
Well, sweetie, I was...
pouring my heart out in song.

09:10.083 --> 09:12.653
These are the silly things
that people do for love.

09:12.686 --> 09:15.088
Aw. How many songs
have you written for Mom?

09:15.122 --> 09:16.957
None.

09:18.992 --> 09:20.728
Yeah, what exactly
is it about me

09:20.761 --> 09:22.996
that made you lose your
passion for songwriting?

09:23.030 --> 09:24.665
(laughs): Well... sweetie,
I was a teenager.

09:24.698 --> 09:27.000
You know, love seemed
so important back then.

09:30.070 --> 09:31.639
Back then?

09:31.672 --> 09:32.873
Back then.

09:32.906 --> 09:33.974
Well... I...

09:34.007 --> 09:35.943
You know what I mean.

09:35.976 --> 09:37.978
Oh, she knows what you mean.

09:38.011 --> 09:42.115
You know, suddenly,
I'm feeling rather warm.

09:42.149 --> 09:43.316
Debbie, my jacket?

09:43.350 --> 09:45.052
Come on. Debbie...

09:45.085 --> 09:47.120
Walker's back on.

09:47.154 --> 09:49.089
Oh, great, now we'll never know

09:49.122 --> 09:53.126
why he's got that rodeo clown
in the choke hold.

10:02.169 --> 10:04.271
Worked up quite a
thirst out there.

10:04.304 --> 10:06.139
You got any
recommendations?

10:06.173 --> 10:08.041
(laughs):
Uh, yeah, a soapy rag.

10:08.075 --> 10:09.977
Soapy Rag-- I've
not heard of that.

10:10.010 --> 10:13.046
Two Soapy Rags, please.
Uh, no, it's
for your face.

10:13.080 --> 10:14.381
What's that?

10:14.414 --> 10:16.917
What the hell? No, I didn't...
I didn't do this.

10:16.950 --> 10:18.686
Yoo-hoo, Nathan!

10:18.719 --> 10:20.187
Mom, did you do this?

10:20.220 --> 10:23.090
Well, you were asleep
in that blazing sun.

10:23.123 --> 10:25.192
I also adjusted
your bathing suit.

10:25.225 --> 10:26.960
It was bunched up so high,

10:26.994 --> 10:28.762
one of your testicles
was peeking out.

10:28.796 --> 10:29.863
Hey...

10:29.897 --> 10:31.832
The lefticle.
Okay, listen...

10:31.865 --> 10:33.333
Can I get a
mai tai, please?

10:33.366 --> 10:35.402
Listen, Mom, I need
to learn how to relax,

10:35.435 --> 10:37.971
and I can't do that with you
freaking out about everything.

10:38.005 --> 10:39.773
So, basically,
I don't have a chance

10:39.807 --> 10:41.041
unless you learn to relax, too.

10:41.074 --> 10:43.977
I know how to relax.
I'm good at it.

10:44.011 --> 10:46.814
At Debbie's yoga studio,
I took a meditation class,

10:46.847 --> 10:49.983
and finished ten minutes
ahead of everyone else.

10:50.017 --> 10:51.151
Listen, Mom,
you have

10:51.184 --> 10:52.820
the same problem
that I have.

10:52.853 --> 10:54.154
It's hard for
us to relax.

10:54.187 --> 10:56.156
But, you know, somehow
we need to learn

10:56.189 --> 10:57.758
to just go
with the flow.

10:57.791 --> 10:59.159
Look at that guy
over there.

10:59.192 --> 11:01.294
There's a man that
knows how to relax.

11:01.328 --> 11:04.097
Excuse me, sir, sorry, uh,
what-what's your name?

11:09.837 --> 11:11.104
Ganja Pete.

11:11.138 --> 11:13.173
Course it is!

11:13.206 --> 11:15.709
I'm-I'm so sorry. What's your...
what's your plan for the day,

11:15.743 --> 11:17.077
Ganja Pete?

11:17.110 --> 11:20.147
Well, I'm gonna shower.

11:20.180 --> 11:22.149
Then I'm gonna do
some drinking,

11:22.182 --> 11:24.818
some dancing.

11:24.852 --> 11:26.486
Hey.

11:26.519 --> 11:28.155
I was lying
about the shower.

11:28.188 --> 11:29.189
Were you?

11:29.222 --> 11:30.791
Hey. I love this guy.

11:30.824 --> 11:32.726
We could learn something
from him.

11:32.760 --> 11:35.128
Hey, you want to buy
a shell necklace?

11:35.162 --> 11:39.132
It doubles as a leash
for your lizard.

11:39.166 --> 11:42.169
Oh. Yeah, well,
I-I don't have a lizard.

11:42.202 --> 11:44.872
Well, it's probably run away
'cause you don't have a leash.

11:44.905 --> 11:46.974
Okay, Pete,
we're-we're done here.

11:47.007 --> 11:49.309
Thank you. But... you see
what I mean, though, right?

11:49.342 --> 11:51.111
I mean, for the next three days,

11:51.144 --> 11:54.114
let's be as blissful
as Ganja Pete.

11:54.147 --> 11:56.183
Well, he does seem happy.

11:56.216 --> 11:57.517
I don't know, Nathan.

11:57.550 --> 11:59.386
I don't know if I can be
that kind of person.

11:59.419 --> 12:02.389
Of course you can.
Look, Mom, life is short.

12:02.422 --> 12:07.060
Let's make this
vacation count.

12:07.094 --> 12:10.130
* Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga *

12:10.163 --> 12:12.132
* I know you can't
control yourself any longer *

12:12.165 --> 12:14.467
* Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga *

12:14.501 --> 12:16.870
* I know you can't
control yourself any longer *

12:29.016 --> 12:31.985
CROWD (chanting):
Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug! Chug!
Chug! Chug! Chug!

12:32.019 --> 12:35.255
(cheering)

12:35.288 --> 12:38.091
* Let your body feel the heat

12:38.125 --> 12:40.994
(Carol shouts)

12:41.028 --> 12:42.329
No, I'm not gonna...

12:42.362 --> 12:45.165
Come on. Come on.
No, no, no.
I'm not gonna...

12:45.198 --> 12:47.167
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

12:47.200 --> 12:49.202
(cheering and whooping)

12:54.541 --> 12:57.010
Wow.

12:57.044 --> 12:58.979
* Come on, shake your body,
baby, do the conga. *

12:59.012 --> 13:01.248
Uh, Mom, don't come out
for a minute!

13:01.281 --> 13:03.984
There's broken glass
all over the floor!

13:04.017 --> 13:06.419
I can't believe I'm getting
on a plane in a couple hours.

13:06.453 --> 13:08.421
I never even asked you
where you're from.

13:08.455 --> 13:11.291
Uh, Minnesota.
(chuckles) You?

13:11.324 --> 13:13.126
Virginia.

13:13.160 --> 13:15.195
(exhales)
Yeah.

13:15.228 --> 13:17.297
Well, take care.

13:17.330 --> 13:19.332
Yeah. You, too.

13:20.300 --> 13:22.069
Okay, Mom,
I cleaned up the glass!

13:22.102 --> 13:24.337
You can come on out now!

13:24.371 --> 13:26.874
Mom? You can come out.

13:26.907 --> 13:29.409
Mom?

13:29.442 --> 13:30.410
She never came home.

13:30.443 --> 13:32.145
Oh, my God, oh, my God,
oh, my God, oh, my God.

13:32.179 --> 13:33.881
Eddie, Eddie,

13:33.914 --> 13:36.884
do you know where my mom is?
Is she here?

13:36.917 --> 13:39.286
Did you teach her to blend in
with the walls?

13:41.288 --> 13:43.190
I think I still might be drunk.

13:43.223 --> 13:45.358
Yeah, you're drunk, all right.

13:45.392 --> 13:47.394
What?

13:54.267 --> 13:57.537
(upbeat tune plays)

13:57.570 --> 14:01.341
* And when you're
at the Whispering Frog *

14:01.374 --> 14:04.211
* I love to see
your downward dog *

14:04.244 --> 14:06.179
* Debbie, Debbie

14:06.213 --> 14:07.915
* You're so fine

14:07.948 --> 14:11.318
* I'm glad you said
that you'd be mine *

14:11.351 --> 14:14.321
* Your ruby lips,
your hair is red *

14:14.354 --> 14:16.890
* And best of all

14:16.924 --> 14:18.325
* You're great in bed.

14:18.358 --> 14:20.360
(playing harmonica)

14:28.368 --> 14:30.370
(song ends)

14:30.403 --> 14:31.604
Well?

14:31.638 --> 14:33.606
"Red" and "bed."

14:33.640 --> 14:36.376
Really gave that
rhyming dictionary a workout.

14:38.411 --> 14:39.512
Wait, Debbie,
just help me understand

14:39.546 --> 14:40.513
why you're still upset.

14:40.547 --> 14:41.915
I don't want to talk, okay?

14:41.949 --> 14:43.116
I just want to be alone.

14:43.150 --> 14:44.284
Can we be alone together?

14:45.318 --> 14:47.220
Adam.
Okay, well...

14:47.254 --> 14:50.057
(sighs)
Just let me take a walk
with you, okay?

14:51.091 --> 14:52.325
Okay, fine.

14:52.359 --> 14:54.261
Okay, thank you.
Okay.

14:54.294 --> 14:56.396
I just think it's important
that we talk about this.

14:56.429 --> 14:59.332
Okay? W... Hey.

14:59.366 --> 15:01.001
Debbie, how can I fix it

15:01.034 --> 15:02.469
if I still don't know
what's bothering you?

15:02.502 --> 15:04.337
Okay, you want to know
what it is?

15:04.371 --> 15:06.473
You have no passion for me.
You know?

15:06.506 --> 15:09.342
You-you see me as a boring
housewife in Snoopy pajamas

15:09.376 --> 15:11.344
who only shaves up to the knee.

15:11.378 --> 15:13.280
I love your prickly thighs.

15:13.313 --> 15:15.548
Just give me one more chance.
Okay. (clears throat)

15:15.582 --> 15:17.084
Uh...

15:17.117 --> 15:19.552
* I'm not like
all the other guys *

15:19.586 --> 15:22.655
* I really like
your prickly thighs *

15:22.689 --> 15:24.357
* I like the way
they scratch my chin *

15:24.391 --> 15:27.194
* And...

15:27.227 --> 15:28.395
I just wanted to know

15:28.428 --> 15:30.297
how it feels
for you to cry over me

15:30.330 --> 15:32.199
like you cried
over that Sierra girl.

15:32.232 --> 15:33.733
What are you talking
about? That's crazy.

15:33.766 --> 15:35.035
(grunts)

15:35.068 --> 15:36.369
I cried...

15:36.403 --> 15:38.071
for Sierra...

15:38.105 --> 15:39.706
(grunting)

15:39.739 --> 15:41.641
...because I was miserable!

15:41.674 --> 15:44.177
And I haven't felt that way
since I met you.

15:44.211 --> 15:46.346
I mean, I can't cry
over a woman who brings me

15:46.379 --> 15:48.715
nothing but joy
every single day.

15:48.748 --> 15:51.018
I adore you, Debbie!
You're perfect!

15:51.051 --> 15:52.019
Oh...

15:52.052 --> 15:54.054
(groans)

15:58.525 --> 16:00.393
Did you mean it?

16:00.427 --> 16:02.996
I make you happy every day?

16:03.030 --> 16:04.998
(grunting)

16:05.032 --> 16:07.267
Every day.

16:07.300 --> 16:10.270
That's the sweetest thing
anyone's ever said to me.

16:10.303 --> 16:13.206
So much better than any song.

16:13.240 --> 16:14.607
You're the girl for me, Deb.

16:14.641 --> 16:17.410
And, besides,
I looked Sierra up on Facebook,

16:17.444 --> 16:19.446
and let's just say
the years have not been kind.

16:19.479 --> 16:20.780
(chuckles)

16:20.813 --> 16:22.415
You did what?
Wait, wait, wait.

16:22.449 --> 16:23.483
Debbie, wait...

16:23.516 --> 16:25.018
No, you'd be proud of me!

16:25.052 --> 16:27.020
I didn't accept her request
to play FarmVille!

16:27.054 --> 16:29.222
(grunts)
Oh, God.

16:40.400 --> 16:41.468
Where's my mother?

16:41.501 --> 16:42.735
And don't tell me
you don't know

16:42.769 --> 16:44.371
'cause I tracked her here
with my phone.

16:44.404 --> 16:47.374
Are you the UPS man?

16:47.407 --> 16:50.043
'Cause I've been waiting
for my replacement passport

16:50.077 --> 16:51.778
for 19 years now.

16:53.713 --> 16:56.083
Are you looking for me?

16:58.218 --> 17:00.520
Mom, what happened to your hair?

17:00.553 --> 17:04.524
You look
like Bo Derek... 's grandmother.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.459
Like it?

17:06.493 --> 17:09.329
Ganja Pete has a
surprisingly steady hand

17:09.362 --> 17:12.332
for a man whose first
name is a synonym with

17:12.365 --> 17:14.167
"marijuana."
Marijuana.

17:14.201 --> 17:16.569
Okay. Thank you, Ganja Pete.
You're a very wonderful man,

17:16.603 --> 17:19.072
and-and thank you
for your hospitality. We'll...

17:19.106 --> 17:20.373
be sure to remember
you every time

17:20.407 --> 17:23.176
we smell a neglected aquarium.

17:23.210 --> 17:25.078
Come on, Mom.
Our plane leaves in two hours.

17:25.112 --> 17:26.413
And, judging by the smell
of you,

17:26.446 --> 17:28.415
I predict a very thorough search
at customs.

17:28.448 --> 17:30.450
I'm not getting
on the plane, son.

17:30.483 --> 17:33.386
Mom, what are you talking about?
This isn't you.

17:33.420 --> 17:36.123
What... what happened
last night?

17:36.156 --> 17:38.158
This morning, when I watched
the sun come up,

17:38.191 --> 17:40.593
I realized,
for the first time in my life,

17:40.627 --> 17:42.595
I didn't wish
it was earlier or later--

17:42.629 --> 17:44.731
I was just happy
to be in the moment.

17:44.764 --> 17:46.433
And then I heard your voice.

17:46.466 --> 17:48.501
And do you know
what it was saying?

17:48.535 --> 17:49.836
I can see Ganja Pete's wiener.

17:49.869 --> 17:52.339
No, no, it-it...

17:52.372 --> 17:54.274
No, no. I can see it
through the window.

17:54.307 --> 17:56.376
He's doing his slow
karate naked. Wow.

17:56.409 --> 17:59.112
He's got beads
down there, too, huh?

17:59.146 --> 18:00.180
I know.

18:00.213 --> 18:03.350
Once those get going,
they really make a racket.

18:04.384 --> 18:05.718
Anyway, your voice

18:05.752 --> 18:07.520
was saying, "Life is short.

18:07.554 --> 18:09.856
You need to make
every moment count."

18:09.889 --> 18:12.259
And, damn it, you're right.

18:12.292 --> 18:13.426
Come on, Nathan.

18:13.460 --> 18:17.530
Let's give ourselves one,
just one more day in paradise.

18:17.564 --> 18:19.599
Well...

18:19.632 --> 18:23.203
I guess one more day
couldn't hurt.

18:23.236 --> 18:27.607
Yoo-hoo!
My coconut's empty!

18:27.640 --> 18:30.777
All right, all right,
all right. Yes I.

18:30.810 --> 18:34.781
Oh. Ooh.

18:34.814 --> 18:39.752
(sighs)
I'm so glad that you talked me
into staying one more day.

18:39.786 --> 18:42.589
You know what I'd be doing
if I was home right now?

18:42.622 --> 18:45.292
I wouldn't be playing with
my hair beads, that's for sure.

18:45.325 --> 18:46.293
(sighs)

18:46.326 --> 18:48.761
I like doing this.

18:48.795 --> 18:51.798
Sounds like applause.

18:54.534 --> 18:56.269
Finally!

18:56.303 --> 18:57.937
I've been rolling

18:57.970 --> 18:59.539
my injured ass
all over this island

18:59.572 --> 19:01.708
trying to find
you sunburned idiots.

19:01.741 --> 19:04.644
What are you
doing here, Ray?

19:04.677 --> 19:07.247
Come on, Ray. I told you that we
were coming home tomorrow, man.

19:07.280 --> 19:09.616
You told me you were coming home
tomorrow eight days straight.

19:09.649 --> 19:11.951
That's a whole Hanukkah
of lies.

19:11.984 --> 19:13.953
I should've never
let amateurs

19:13.986 --> 19:16.556
on an island vacation
with no exit strategy.

19:16.589 --> 19:18.425
You're like two kids
on a merry-go-round

19:18.458 --> 19:19.692
who don't know how to get off!

19:19.726 --> 19:21.661
Look at you two!
You look like backup dancers

19:21.694 --> 19:23.696
for Rick James!

19:24.831 --> 19:27.467
What was the big game plan?
You stay here forever?

19:27.500 --> 19:29.536
And make shell necklaces? Huh?

19:29.569 --> 19:32.472
Paint tropical scenes
on the backs of turtles?

19:32.505 --> 19:34.874
Become a Rastafarian minister?

19:34.907 --> 19:38.345
Build eco-friendly homes
out of empty coconuts?

19:38.378 --> 19:40.547
Race hermit crabs? Huh?

19:40.580 --> 19:42.215
Get leathery skin?

19:42.249 --> 19:44.617
Paint tropical scenes
on the backs of turtles?

19:44.651 --> 19:45.752
You already said that one.

19:45.785 --> 19:49.289
I repeat myself once in 12
hours and you call me on it?

19:49.322 --> 19:51.491
You take those beads
out of your head.

19:51.524 --> 19:52.559
And, you,

19:52.592 --> 19:54.227
I don't know what
you got pierced,

19:54.261 --> 19:55.895
but whatever set off the metal
detector at the airport,

19:55.928 --> 19:57.930
take it out!

20:00.700 --> 20:03.336
We really let ourselves
get carried away.

20:03.370 --> 20:05.572
I feel kind of silly.

20:05.605 --> 20:09.309
Yeah. Now I know why Ganja Pete
doesn't have a mirror.

20:09.342 --> 20:12.279
We look like Miller Vanilli.

20:12.312 --> 20:13.980
It's nice to be home again.

20:14.013 --> 20:15.848
Yeah, it is.
Although it was kind of nice

20:15.882 --> 20:17.284
learning how to live
in the moment.

20:17.317 --> 20:18.918
I agree.

20:18.951 --> 20:21.954
That's why I stole these
from the hotel bar.

20:21.988 --> 20:26.293
I thought once a week we could
set our clocks to island time,

20:26.326 --> 20:28.461
pour ourselves a couple
of mai tais and...

20:28.495 --> 20:32.365
maybe make some of Ganja Pete's
famous rosemary brownies.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.301
(chuckles)
Yeah.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.305
Uh, "rosemary" might be a little
harder to find back here.

20:38.338 --> 20:40.640
No, rosemary's
at the grocery store.

20:40.673 --> 20:43.610
The hard part
will be getting the weed.

20:43.643 --> 20:46.012
We did get kind of crazy
down on that island.

20:46.045 --> 20:48.381
Maybe... I don't know.
Maybe we shouldn't...

20:48.415 --> 20:51.017
share all the details
with the rest of the family.

20:51.050 --> 20:53.820
Oh, you better delete
those videos off of your phone.

20:53.853 --> 20:54.821
Oh, yeah.

20:54.854 --> 20:57.490
Think I might've drunk-posted
that one of you

20:57.524 --> 21:01.528
doing the splits between
those two moving tortoises.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.763
(conga music playing on laptop)

21:03.796 --> 21:05.732
Looks like we have
a new weirdest grandma.
