01:03.280 --> 01:05.440
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:06.960 --> 01:09.360
<i>Kill them. </i>

02:45.880 --> 02:47.920
What's wrong, Ronnie?

02:51.480 --> 02:53.600
I love you, Jodie.

03:10.080 --> 03:11.680
<i>Suffolk County police. </i>
<i>May I help you?</i>

03:11.840 --> 03:13.320
<i>Everybody's dead. </i>

03:13.680 --> 03:15.360
<i>What do you mean,</i>
<i>"everybody's dead"?</i>

03:15.680 --> 03:17.520
<i>A guy come running</i>
<i>into the bar and says... </i>

03:17.680 --> 03:19.920
<i>... his mother and father are shot. </i>

03:20.160 --> 03:22.720
I've been to a lot of crime scenes,
never seen one like this.

03:22.880 --> 03:25.280
<i>Six members of the family</i>
<i>were found last night... </i>

03:26.080 --> 03:28.360
...in bed, shot...

03:28.680 --> 03:30.240
...and killed.

03:31.320 --> 03:34.840
<i>Killed were car dealer Ronald Defeo,</i>
<i>his wife and four of their children. </i>

03:35.000 --> 03:36.560
<i>The sole survivor of the family... </i>

03:36.720 --> 03:38.880
<i>... 23-year-old</i>
<i>Ronald "Butch" Defeo Jr... </i>

03:39.040 --> 03:40.880
<i>... is said to have discovered</i>
<i>the bodies. </i>

03:41.040 --> 03:42.960
<i>The police state</i>
<i>that for his own safety... </i>

03:43.120 --> 03:45.200
<i>... they're holding him</i>
<i>in protective custody. </i>

03:45.360 --> 03:48.000
<i>Five of the victims were found</i>
<i>shot facedown on their beds. </i>

03:48.600 --> 03:50.240
The sixth was found in a closet.

03:52.080 --> 03:54.440
No one seemed to stir in their sleep.
It's strange.

03:54.600 --> 03:58.320
<i>Suffolk County police have charged</i>
<i>23-year-old Ronald Defeo Jr. </i>

03:58.480 --> 04:00.400
<i>The accused told police</i>
<i>he heard voices... </i>

04:00.560 --> 04:03.720
<i>... coming from within the house,</i>
<i>telling him to murder his family. </i>

04:17.880 --> 04:19.800
Oh, God!

04:20.320 --> 04:21.760
Damn it.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.560
Hi, Michael.

04:32.880 --> 04:34.480
Oh, hey, baby. You okay?

04:34.640 --> 04:36.560
George, what are you doing
to my mom?

04:37.320 --> 04:38.840
Nothing.

04:39.040 --> 04:40.720
- Yet.
- You perv.

04:48.320 --> 04:50.360
Come on up here, little man.

04:54.480 --> 04:56.280
You can make it.

04:56.680 --> 04:58.840
Oh, you're getting heavy.

05:03.440 --> 05:05.080
Did you meet my dad?

05:06.280 --> 05:07.880
No...

05:08.120 --> 05:09.480
...never had the pleasure, pal.

05:10.920 --> 05:12.520
Do I have to call you "Dad" now?

05:13.360 --> 05:14.920
- Guess what.
- What?

05:15.280 --> 05:17.880
- You can call me whatever you want.
- Anything?

05:18.040 --> 05:19.920
- Yep.
- Cool.

05:20.120 --> 05:21.920
- Anything.
- Cool.

05:22.080 --> 05:23.640
Yeah.

05:24.240 --> 05:26.040
- Stinky.
- Sure.

05:26.200 --> 05:27.680
- Poopy-head.
- Yeah.

05:27.840 --> 05:29.600
Crap-monkey-fart.

05:29.760 --> 05:32.920
Okay, we gotta draw the line
somewhere, pal, that does it.

05:38.240 --> 05:40.000
All right.

05:46.840 --> 05:48.880
- This sucks.
- You're not kidding.

05:49.040 --> 05:50.440
Billy.

05:50.880 --> 05:53.720
Look, maybe we'll grab you
something on the way to school.

05:53.880 --> 05:56.720
- What do you say, huh?
- I'm not hungry. I can walk to school.

05:56.880 --> 05:59.320
No, you can't, and get
your feet off the chair.

05:59.920 --> 06:01.960
I'll drop you a couple blocks away.
Nobody'd see.

06:02.120 --> 06:04.000
- Mom, I'm 12 years old.
- Before you plan...

06:04.160 --> 06:06.880
...your retirement party, we're gonna
drop you off at school.

06:07.040 --> 06:08.920
We got a big day.

06:10.440 --> 06:11.920
Why? Where are you guys going?

06:13.600 --> 06:16.200
- Mom, can you help me?
- Oh, Michael.

06:20.960 --> 06:23.000
Houses here are way out
of our price range, Kath.

06:23.200 --> 06:24.800
Not according to this.

06:24.960 --> 06:28.400
- Well, then it's gotta be true.
- Think positive, babe.

06:28.600 --> 06:31.920
I'm positive that houses here
are out of our price range.

06:34.160 --> 06:35.920
Look, when the business
is going good...

06:36.080 --> 06:37.240
...we're gonna...
- There.

06:37.400 --> 06:38.600
- What?
- That's it.

06:39.200 --> 06:40.400
- Look.
- Honey.

06:40.560 --> 06:42.280
Baby, look, 412 Ocean Avenue.

06:48.440 --> 06:50.280
- It's beautiful.
- What?

07:05.680 --> 07:08.000
Look at how friendly they are here,
honey.

07:08.200 --> 07:10.600
They get like that when they think
they'll make a sale.

07:10.760 --> 07:14.760
Let's just play it cool, Kath.
Kathy. Katherine.

07:15.440 --> 07:16.920
Or not.

07:24.160 --> 07:26.080
- Hi there.
- I'm Katherine Lutz.

07:26.240 --> 07:28.320
Well, just call me Edith.
This is your husband?

07:28.480 --> 07:30.840
- George.
- This is an amazing house.

07:31.000 --> 07:34.880
You are going to love it.
Just follow me in here.

07:35.760 --> 07:38.200
Careful on the steps there.

07:54.400 --> 07:57.400
Holy shit.

07:58.200 --> 07:59.720
Excuse me.

07:59.880 --> 08:02.160
Let me show you
the rest of the house.

08:02.920 --> 08:05.240
This... This is a mistake.

08:05.400 --> 08:06.640
How's that?

08:06.800 --> 08:08.880
No, I mean your ad in the paper.

08:10.080 --> 08:11.560
This is...

08:11.720 --> 08:13.800
It's gotta be a misprint.
I'm a contractor...

08:13.960 --> 08:16.280
...and I know what a place
like this should cost.

08:16.440 --> 08:17.680
And, you know, if this is...

08:17.840 --> 08:21.320
Well, if this is true, then this is a...
The deal of a lifetime.

08:21.680 --> 08:23.760
And what is wrong with that?

08:24.600 --> 08:27.280
- Come on.
- I love it.

08:30.440 --> 08:34.039
- There's a vibrant history here.
- Vibrant history, George.

08:34.200 --> 08:37.799
In fact, the house was built
in 1692, at least the basement.

08:38.320 --> 08:40.679
The rest of the house was added
from that foundation.

08:40.840 --> 08:43.240
It's one of the oldest Dutch Colonials
in Long Island.

08:43.400 --> 08:44.720
Wow, that's impressive.

08:44.880 --> 08:47.880
This room would be perfect
for children, if you have any.

08:48.040 --> 08:51.960
And the view's...
Well, have a look for yourselves.

08:54.560 --> 08:56.120
There's a boathouse.

08:56.280 --> 08:58.200
Oh, all you need now
is a boat, right?

08:58.360 --> 09:01.240
Actually, George has a speedboat.

09:01.800 --> 09:05.080
This place sounds
like it's made for you.

09:15.000 --> 09:17.920
And this is your basement.

09:18.080 --> 09:21.120
As you can see,
it's very spacious.

09:21.280 --> 09:23.800
It can be a game room,
a playroom.

09:24.000 --> 09:25.720
Well, let's... Let's have a look.

09:31.320 --> 09:34.200
I'll just wait up here.

09:39.600 --> 09:41.720
Yep, looks like a basement.

09:41.920 --> 09:43.840
So, what do you guys think?

09:44.000 --> 09:48.120
- I think you look foxy in that skirt.
- Will you stop it? Come on.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.360
Yes, yes, okay?

10:01.720 --> 10:04.560
It's a value. It's a value
for people with money.

10:04.760 --> 10:07.720
Okay, look, if we do this, we're
gonna be eating dry wall for a year.

10:07.880 --> 10:09.480
We deserve this, George.

10:09.640 --> 10:11.640
You deserve this.

10:11.800 --> 10:14.400
How many times you tell me
how hard you work for so little.

10:14.560 --> 10:17.120
- Kathy...
- Maybe today is the day it all pays off.

10:17.880 --> 10:19.920
- We'll make sacrifices.
- Huge sacrifices.

10:20.080 --> 10:22.960
Yeah, I understand that.
Listen, honey...

10:23.120 --> 10:25.280
...this is the life we want.

10:40.240 --> 10:42.320
- We're happy?
- Yes, we're happy.

10:42.480 --> 10:44.880
She's happy. I'm broke.

10:46.880 --> 10:48.240
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

10:48.440 --> 10:52.480
So look, I gotta ask,
what's the catch?

10:53.560 --> 10:55.800
There's always a catch.

10:57.160 --> 11:01.480
There was a tragedy, a crime...

11:01.640 --> 11:04.240
...a murder.
- I'm sorry, what?

11:04.480 --> 11:06.280
In the house?

11:07.080 --> 11:08.480
Several people, a family.

11:10.600 --> 11:12.920
But, you know, we've moved on,
the whole town.

11:13.120 --> 11:15.680
It is a distant memory now.

11:16.440 --> 11:18.560
And the house is fine.

11:18.720 --> 11:20.200
Really.

11:20.400 --> 11:22.920
Doesn't it seem kind of strange
to buy this house, honey?

11:23.080 --> 11:25.200
Well, houses don't kill people.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.600
People kill people.

11:28.800 --> 11:31.720
Just... Excuse us.

11:33.280 --> 11:35.480
Do you think we can make it work?

11:40.680 --> 11:42.400
You know what?

11:42.840 --> 11:45.880
You want it,
then we're gonna make it work.

11:46.040 --> 11:48.080
- Really?
- I'll work out of the basement...

11:48.280 --> 11:50.000
...and you can, well...

11:50.920 --> 11:52.760
...sell one of the kids.
- Hey.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.840
A little one.

12:09.200 --> 12:10.960
We're rich! We're rich!

12:11.440 --> 12:14.080
We're rich in something,
but it ain't money.

12:16.520 --> 12:17.920
Wait.

12:57.120 --> 12:59.720
- You say your prayers?
- Yep, said them twice.

12:59.960 --> 13:03.560
- What did you pray for?
- Lf I tell you, it won't come true.

13:04.600 --> 13:06.280
Why don't you tell him the truth.

13:06.440 --> 13:08.840
- What?
- Praying doesn't do any good.

13:09.240 --> 13:10.600
William.

13:10.800 --> 13:14.200
Nobody answered me when
I asked for Dad to be kept alive.

13:16.240 --> 13:18.120
Don't say that.

13:22.440 --> 13:25.320
Sometimes things happen in life
that can't be explained, Billy.

13:31.160 --> 13:32.720
Billy, look at me.

13:34.120 --> 13:36.880
I need you to give George
a chance, okay?

13:37.920 --> 13:41.000
You're not being disloyal
to Dad by liking George.

13:42.320 --> 13:44.840
He doesn't want to be anything
but your friend...

13:45.400 --> 13:47.160
...and maybe one day
something more.

13:47.720 --> 13:50.640
Nobody will ever
replace your dad, honey.

13:53.000 --> 13:54.600
For you too?

13:55.360 --> 13:56.920
For me too.

14:11.760 --> 14:13.400
How's Billy?

14:13.880 --> 14:15.480
He'll be fine.

14:16.880 --> 14:18.920
- First call.
- First call.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.880
- Lutz residence, how may I help you?
<i>- Can I talk to my daughter, please?</i>

14:25.160 --> 14:29.240
Yeah, sure, she's...
She's right here. Okay.

14:29.560 --> 14:32.040
Your mother's gotta stop
gushing over me, seriously.

14:32.200 --> 14:34.040
It's embarrassing now.

14:34.560 --> 14:36.280
<i>Hello?</i>

14:37.000 --> 14:40.000
- Hey, Ma.
<i>- Hi. </i>

14:40.280 --> 14:42.400
No, we're all moved in.

14:44.440 --> 14:46.480
- Yeah, Ma.
- Are you cold?

14:48.640 --> 14:50.400
No, Ma.

14:51.240 --> 14:52.080
Yeah.

16:52.160 --> 16:55.120
- What is it, baby?
- Nothing.

16:56.760 --> 16:59.640
- Are you okay, baby?
- No.

17:00.200 --> 17:02.040
I don't feel well.

17:16.960 --> 17:18.839
- Give me a kiss.
- I can do it, I can do it.

17:19.000 --> 17:20.440
No, you can't.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.599
Come here, come here.

17:25.400 --> 17:28.160
Honey, I'm gonna
make you some tea.

17:35.480 --> 17:38.400
How many brothers and sisters
do you have?

17:41.160 --> 17:43.880
- Chelsea?
- Hey, Mommy.

17:44.040 --> 17:46.200
Hi, hon. Who are you talking to?

17:46.360 --> 17:49.800
- The girl who lives in my closet.
- Oh, yeah?

17:49.960 --> 17:52.160
- And what's her name?
- Jodie.

17:53.120 --> 17:56.520
You know there are plenty of other
little girls to play with in town too?

17:56.680 --> 17:58.840
I know, but Jodie says
they're all mean.

18:00.880 --> 18:02.080
Is that Jodie?

18:07.520 --> 18:09.920
No, that's someone else.

18:10.080 --> 18:11.520
Who?

18:11.680 --> 18:14.320
I'm not supposed to say who.

18:16.080 --> 18:18.480
She says it's an A-hole.

18:18.680 --> 18:21.040
You are not allowed
to say that word.

18:40.440 --> 18:42.520
George, George.

18:42.960 --> 18:45.600
- Look what I found.
- What is that? Where'd you find that?

18:45.760 --> 18:46.960
Harry and I found it.

18:47.840 --> 18:50.080
- Where?
- In the basement.

18:50.640 --> 18:52.120
Not the basement.

18:52.280 --> 18:54.280
My office.

18:55.960 --> 18:58.320
You listen to me.
You don't go down there.

18:59.040 --> 19:00.560
Understand?

19:07.920 --> 19:10.520
Guys, would you help me
with the groceries?

19:12.360 --> 19:14.680
Go on, go help your mom.

19:19.480 --> 19:21.240
I'm sorry.

19:22.800 --> 19:24.280
Go on.

19:38.120 --> 19:41.040
- How are you feeling?
- Good, good.

19:42.000 --> 19:44.640
I found a babysitter off a board
at the grocery store.

19:44.800 --> 19:46.000
Billy will love that.

19:46.160 --> 19:48.080
How about we call her
the young-adult-sitter?

19:50.600 --> 19:51.840
Where's Chelsea?

19:53.840 --> 19:55.360
Where's Chelsea?

20:04.600 --> 20:06.320
Chelsea?

20:13.640 --> 20:14.800
Chelsea?

20:15.160 --> 20:16.960
Chelsea!

20:23.040 --> 20:24.400
Chelsea.

20:24.560 --> 20:25.960
Hey, give me your hand.

20:26.280 --> 20:27.440
Give me your hand, sweetie.

20:27.640 --> 20:30.880
- Chelsea, go to George.
- Come on. Hey, give me your hand.

20:36.400 --> 20:39.000
What were you thinking?
You could have fallen in the water.

20:39.160 --> 20:41.000
Jodie wanted to see the boat.

20:44.000 --> 20:46.000
Somebody should have been
watching you.

21:43.760 --> 21:46.440
Billy, get up.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.440
Billy, I gotta go pee.

24:02.400 --> 24:03.800
Chelsea.

24:46.600 --> 24:48.240
Goddamn it, Harry.

24:51.240 --> 24:53.960
Seriously. You trying to kill me?

25:58.600 --> 26:00.040
Come on, get away from there.

26:00.280 --> 26:01.960
Hey, that's enough.

26:02.440 --> 26:04.000
Hey!

26:12.320 --> 26:14.680
George? Hon, what are you
doing down here?

26:15.520 --> 26:18.640
It's the only place
that's warm in this damn house.

26:19.760 --> 26:21.800
Somebody keeps opening
the windows.

26:26.200 --> 26:27.880
What is that?

26:29.760 --> 26:31.560
You tell me.

26:33.040 --> 26:35.800
- Why don't you come back to bed.
- No, I can't sleep.

26:35.960 --> 26:37.560
I'm sorry, baby.

26:37.760 --> 26:39.440
Don't...

26:39.640 --> 26:42.240
Don't talk to me like
I'm one of your kids, okay?

26:42.400 --> 26:44.880
- What?
- That goddamn dog woke me up.

26:46.400 --> 26:48.080
Billy's dog.

26:50.000 --> 26:51.360
Found him in the boathouse.

26:52.600 --> 26:55.000
- But you locked it.
- Yeah.

26:55.160 --> 26:57.640
Hey, and guess
what I found in Billy's room.

27:05.600 --> 27:07.600
You ready to talk
about those keys?

27:07.800 --> 27:10.840
There's not a lot in this world can't
be solved with an apology, Billy.

27:11.000 --> 27:13.320
I'm not apologizing
for something I didn't do...

27:13.480 --> 27:14.720
...George.

27:25.560 --> 27:27.560
Get to work, buddy.

27:30.120 --> 27:32.520
"Get to work, buddy. "

28:00.760 --> 28:02.720
"Katch 'em... "

28:04.680 --> 28:06.400
George?

28:06.880 --> 28:08.680
George?

28:09.280 --> 28:11.280
George, you down there?

28:13.240 --> 28:14.640
George?

28:17.080 --> 28:18.240
What?

28:18.400 --> 28:19.840
What's the matter?

28:21.840 --> 28:24.080
Did you do that thing
with the magnets?

28:29.320 --> 28:31.520
Nothing. Just seeing things,
I guess.

29:00.720 --> 29:01.920
You look hideous.

29:02.080 --> 29:04.560
You're rather repulsive yourself,
Mr. Lutz.

29:04.760 --> 29:07.120
- Where's the babysitter?
- Babysitter?

29:07.320 --> 29:09.040
Told you guys,
I don't need a babysitter.

29:09.200 --> 29:11.240
- I'm old enough.
- Baby, I know you can...

29:11.400 --> 29:15.160
I'm not letting her watch us. She's
not coming in, I won't let her. I won't.

29:15.800 --> 29:17.680
- She's not coming in.
- Billy, listen to me.

29:17.840 --> 29:20.880
- I won't leave you alone.
- I can't believe you hired a babysitter.

29:21.040 --> 29:22.560
- I told you I was old enough.
- Hi.

29:22.720 --> 29:25.320
- I'm Lisa, the babysitter.
- Great.

29:25.880 --> 29:27.760
Can I take your coat?

29:28.000 --> 29:29.520
Okay.

29:31.400 --> 29:33.080
Hi.

29:34.880 --> 29:36.120
I'm Billy.

29:45.320 --> 29:47.840
You sure you don't want
a babysitter?

29:48.080 --> 29:50.000
Would you like me
to show you around?

29:50.160 --> 29:51.400
No, it's okay.

29:51.560 --> 29:54.120
I know it already.
I used to sit for the Defeos.

29:58.200 --> 30:00.000
Kind of freaky being back here.

30:00.440 --> 30:01.960
I'm Billy.

30:02.160 --> 30:04.000
Yeah, I got you the first time.

30:04.760 --> 30:06.840
Have a good night, Billy.

30:14.640 --> 30:16.560
This is just what we needed,
don't you think?

30:16.720 --> 30:19.280
Yeah. Definitely.

30:19.440 --> 30:21.280
You feeling all right?

30:21.600 --> 30:23.120
You know what?

30:23.280 --> 30:25.040
I feel better.

30:25.960 --> 30:28.320
I think I just needed
to get out of the house.

30:28.480 --> 30:30.200
Come on, drink up.

30:30.360 --> 30:32.200
Are you trying
to get me drunk, Mr. Lutz?

30:33.280 --> 30:35.440
That's the appeal of marriage, hon.

30:35.640 --> 30:37.360
Hopefully, I won't have to.

30:44.440 --> 30:46.160
Be right out.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.000
Hungry?

30:59.000 --> 31:01.000
Kid, you read my mind.

31:01.520 --> 31:02.720
The kids, they're...

31:02.880 --> 31:04.960
They're going through
a tough time.

31:05.120 --> 31:07.400
I guess they're just
adjusting to everything.

31:07.560 --> 31:09.520
Yeah, well, we all are.

31:11.320 --> 31:13.160
Do you feel different?

31:15.520 --> 31:17.120
What do you mean?

31:17.280 --> 31:18.960
About us.

31:20.560 --> 31:22.360
About me.

31:25.880 --> 31:27.080
Yeah.

31:27.240 --> 31:28.400
Yeah, I do.

31:30.320 --> 31:34.280
I feel like for the first time in my life,
I'm sure about something.

31:35.120 --> 31:36.880
And that's you.

31:38.640 --> 31:41.640
And I'm gonna spend the rest
of my life making you happy.

31:42.320 --> 31:45.080
Oh, boy, you know how
to turn on that Lutz charm.

31:55.400 --> 31:57.840
Some people say his tongue is fake.

32:00.000 --> 32:01.520
I think it's all him.

32:03.960 --> 32:05.320
Got this at a pinball arcade.

32:06.640 --> 32:08.080
Cool.

32:10.600 --> 32:12.320
So do you French?

32:12.840 --> 32:14.360
Do I what?

32:14.520 --> 32:17.000
Kissing, tongues.

32:18.880 --> 32:20.440
No.

32:21.680 --> 32:24.120
Did your family know the Defeos?

32:24.360 --> 32:27.560
- The who?
- The family that lived here before you.

32:29.920 --> 32:31.520
No, we just moved here.

32:32.280 --> 32:34.960
Well, you know what
happened to them, don't you?

32:36.440 --> 32:37.240
No.

32:37.880 --> 32:40.000
I really shouldn't be telling you this.

32:42.600 --> 32:45.000
Your parents are gonna be pissed.

32:46.760 --> 32:48.320
It's okay.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.000
Stop. That's not how you play.

32:54.160 --> 32:58.440
- I can't hear you.
- Stop it. Let me try.

32:59.360 --> 33:01.520
You're killing him.

33:03.320 --> 33:06.160
So this wack job, Ronnie,
the guy that lived here.

33:06.960 --> 33:09.800
People in this town say
he heard voices telling him to do it.

33:09.960 --> 33:14.080
The guy was a nut. I mean, first
he thinks his dog's out to get him.

33:14.240 --> 33:15.560
So he kills it.

33:16.760 --> 33:20.240
A few days later, he thinks his family
is a bunch of demons.

33:20.720 --> 33:22.160
So you know what he did?

33:22.520 --> 33:23.760
Wasted them.

33:24.960 --> 33:26.640
How did he do it?

33:27.920 --> 33:29.760
Do what?

33:29.920 --> 33:32.400
You are way too young to hear this.

33:32.560 --> 33:34.560
So cover your ears.

33:35.880 --> 33:38.280
And don't listen.

33:38.560 --> 33:40.160
A rifle.

33:42.440 --> 33:45.520
He went room to room,
splattering their heads as they slept.

33:46.680 --> 33:49.720
He killed his brothers
in this very room.

33:50.200 --> 33:51.920
Right here.

33:52.920 --> 33:54.840
In these beds.

34:01.760 --> 34:04.920
It's kind of gross
you guys still sleep in here.

34:08.239 --> 34:10.080
Actually, it's fucking sick.

34:11.080 --> 34:12.840
Yeah.

34:13.280 --> 34:14.960
I'm totally freaking you out, kid.

34:16.679 --> 34:19.000
I suck at babysitting.

34:24.920 --> 34:27.280
This was the little brat's room.

34:27.760 --> 34:29.639
Jodie's.

34:31.600 --> 34:33.840
You know, they found her in there.

34:34.560 --> 34:37.040
- Jodie says you're a bad babysitter.
- Yeah?

34:37.320 --> 34:40.400
Well, Jodie's...
What's the word? Dead.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.440
Is not.

34:42.639 --> 34:44.280
That little shit got me fired.

34:48.000 --> 34:49.679
Dare you to go in there.

34:51.520 --> 34:53.480
You give me your Kiss poster
if I do it?

34:55.600 --> 34:57.000
Okay.

34:57.880 --> 34:59.560
Okay.

35:01.720 --> 35:03.880
You're going to make her mad.

35:12.640 --> 35:14.320
Come on, guys.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.840
Ha-ha, guys, this isn't funny.

35:18.000 --> 35:19.360
Billy, Michael.

35:22.000 --> 35:23.640
It's not opening. I can't open it.

35:23.800 --> 35:25.640
- Unlock the fucking door.
- There's no lock.

35:25.800 --> 35:27.440
This isn't funny. Let me the fuck out.

35:27.640 --> 35:29.520
Billy, Michael.

35:30.160 --> 35:32.560
Let me out. Let me out of here.

35:33.640 --> 35:34.840
Let me out of here!

35:38.440 --> 35:39.760
What's going on?

35:40.120 --> 35:41.400
Let me out.

35:42.120 --> 35:44.160
Hi, Lisa.

35:47.800 --> 35:49.360
Look what Ronnie did.

36:08.080 --> 36:09.680
Let me out!

36:10.360 --> 36:12.240
Let me out of here!

36:13.240 --> 36:14.640
Let me out!

36:14.800 --> 36:17.120
Help me. Let me out!

36:26.960 --> 36:28.880
I saw Jodie.

36:29.040 --> 36:30.280
I saw Jodie.

36:30.440 --> 36:31.920
Who's Jodie?

36:32.160 --> 36:34.120
The little girl.

36:35.760 --> 36:37.360
She's dead.

36:37.520 --> 36:39.760
She's supposed to be dead.

36:46.200 --> 36:48.600
- It's one thing to pull a prank.
- We didn't pull a prank.

36:48.760 --> 36:51.160
- It's another one to hurt someone.
- It was this house.

36:51.320 --> 36:52.920
Shut up!

36:55.240 --> 36:56.720
- George.
- I got this under control.

36:56.920 --> 36:58.640
You don't have you under control.

37:01.560 --> 37:03.320
What you guys did was wrong.

37:03.480 --> 37:05.920
Stop it, Kathy.
Whatever you're doing...

37:06.080 --> 37:07.960
...whatever you're saying
doesn't work.

37:08.960 --> 37:11.880
From now on, I'm doing the
disciplining around here, end of story.

37:12.240 --> 37:14.240
This house is bad, Mommy.

37:14.840 --> 37:16.240
Michael, honey.

37:16.480 --> 37:20.200
There's no bad houses.
There's just bad people.

37:21.840 --> 37:24.800
Why didn't you tell us
about the people who died here?

37:27.800 --> 37:30.040
- Where did you hear that?
- The babysitter told me...

37:30.200 --> 37:33.360
...that two little boys died
in our room.

37:38.840 --> 37:40.800
Goddamn babysitter's an idiot.

37:42.400 --> 37:44.520
Get to bed. We'll deal with this
in the morning.

37:44.680 --> 37:46.840
No, I'm not sleeping in that room.
It's gross.

37:47.000 --> 37:49.240
- Me neither.
- Wipe that stupid look off your face...

37:49.400 --> 37:50.840
...and go to bed.

37:53.880 --> 37:55.400
Run.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.240
Why all the yelling, Mommy?

38:20.440 --> 38:24.000
It's nothing. It's over now, baby.

38:26.720 --> 38:29.440
I need you to tell me
what happened with Lisa, honey.

38:29.600 --> 38:32.360
Lisa was being mean to Jodie.

38:32.520 --> 38:33.880
So Jodie hurt her.

38:34.600 --> 38:36.680
- Jodie.
- It's okay, Mommy.

38:37.080 --> 38:39.440
Jodie won't hurt you.

38:39.840 --> 38:41.640
She thinks you're a good mommy.

38:44.840 --> 38:46.640
But the man who lives here...

38:47.640 --> 38:50.160
...she says he's bad.

38:51.080 --> 38:53.720
She wants him to go away.

38:54.040 --> 38:57.360
He makes her do bad things.

39:04.120 --> 39:05.440
Move it...

39:05.600 --> 39:07.440
...from there to there.

39:07.600 --> 39:08.880
Go.

39:13.800 --> 39:16.080
And, Billy, don't come in
until you're finished.

39:54.160 --> 39:55.600
What?

39:56.640 --> 39:59.360
Is this discipline or torture?

39:59.520 --> 40:01.600
Thought it was meat loaf.

40:08.200 --> 40:11.240
When the body suffers,
the spirit flowers.

40:11.480 --> 40:13.520
It's what my dad taught me.

40:13.720 --> 40:16.920
His dad's not around
to teach him that, now, is he?

40:27.000 --> 40:30.320
Billy, why is George such a jerk?

40:30.480 --> 40:34.120
He's not a jerk. He's a douche bag.

40:34.560 --> 40:36.480
And a weirdo.

40:36.680 --> 40:39.400
And a doofus and a dipstick.

40:39.600 --> 40:41.640
<i>Catch them. </i>

40:41.800 --> 40:43.720
<i>Kill them. </i>

40:46.640 --> 40:48.560
<i>Catch them. </i>

40:49.200 --> 40:50.960
<i>Kill them. </i>

40:58.080 --> 41:00.560
<i>Catch them. Kill them. </i>

41:02.280 --> 41:04.120
<i>Catch them. </i>

41:04.320 --> 41:06.120
<i>Kill them. </i>

41:22.520 --> 41:24.400
Kill them.

42:37.680 --> 42:39.680
- No! No!
- Look at me.

42:39.840 --> 42:42.040
- No!
- What's the matter?

42:42.600 --> 42:44.600
- God!
- It's me.

42:44.760 --> 42:46.800
- It's me.
- God!

42:51.000 --> 42:53.200
Baby, it's all right.

42:59.720 --> 43:02.040
Do you use narcotics, Mr. Lutz?

43:02.200 --> 43:04.320
No. But after this week,
I'm gonna give it...

43:04.480 --> 43:06.240
...some serious thought.

43:09.080 --> 43:11.920
Suffer from headaches, nausea?

43:12.120 --> 43:15.800
Actually, I feel great now.

43:16.840 --> 43:18.400
Weird as that may sound.

43:19.880 --> 43:22.120
Well, there's no sign
of a concussion.

43:22.280 --> 43:23.840
No sign of any bruising at all.

43:26.960 --> 43:29.360
I want you to give Dr. Stone a call.

43:30.360 --> 43:33.400
Wait, wait, wait.
This is a psychiatrist.

43:33.560 --> 43:36.480
- Do I look nuts to you?
- I'm not trying to offend you here.

43:36.640 --> 43:39.000
I'm just trying to help you
figure out the problem.

43:47.000 --> 43:48.720
I feel like it's my fault, George.

43:48.880 --> 43:50.880
- Kath.
- I was the one who wanted this place.

43:51.040 --> 43:53.320
- I put too much pressure on you.
- This is the life...

43:53.480 --> 43:54.960
...that I want too, okay?

43:56.680 --> 43:59.600
We got the old American dream here.

43:59.800 --> 44:01.800
Okay? There's no way in hell...

44:01.960 --> 44:03.800
...that I'm letting that get away now.

44:07.560 --> 44:08.760
I love you, George.

44:14.920 --> 44:17.360
Billy, can I get my teddy?

44:17.560 --> 44:19.440
She's real hungry.

44:19.600 --> 44:22.480
Okay, go. And hurry up.

44:22.680 --> 44:25.320
Mom finds out I let you out
of my sight, she's gonna kill me.

44:49.120 --> 44:50.400
Hi, Mommy.

44:50.560 --> 44:52.760
Look at me, Mommy.

44:52.960 --> 44:54.320
Hi, Mommy.

44:57.600 --> 44:59.520
Hi, Mommy.

45:00.440 --> 45:01.720
Oh, my God. Oh, my God!

45:01.880 --> 45:05.080
- Chelsea.
- Chelsea, don't move. Just sit down.

45:06.240 --> 45:07.680
Chelsea.

45:14.520 --> 45:16.080
Chelsea.

45:18.840 --> 45:20.760
Hold the ladder.

45:21.000 --> 45:22.640
Honey, stay there.

45:25.640 --> 45:27.440
Chelsea.

45:27.640 --> 45:29.000
Chelsea.

45:32.000 --> 45:34.360
- Chelsea.
- Goddamn it, Chelsea.

45:34.520 --> 45:37.560
Which way?
Which way did they go?

45:38.080 --> 45:39.520
Going left.

45:49.120 --> 45:50.920
Chelsea.

46:09.080 --> 46:10.600
What are you doing up here?

46:13.440 --> 46:14.800
I have to go with Jodie, Mommy.

46:15.120 --> 46:16.560
Baby...

46:16.760 --> 46:18.640
...you come to Mommy.

46:19.640 --> 46:20.840
No!

46:23.760 --> 46:25.320
George.

46:25.480 --> 46:27.520
- Hang on.
- Hurry.

46:30.640 --> 46:32.240
George!

46:32.440 --> 46:34.560
George, please, God, I'm slipping.

46:36.160 --> 46:37.600
George!

46:38.240 --> 46:40.120
George!

46:43.920 --> 46:45.320
<i>Chelsea. </i>

46:46.400 --> 46:47.640
What would you...?
Why would you do that?

46:47.800 --> 46:49.840
Sorry. I'm sorry.

46:50.040 --> 46:51.560
You can't do that to Mommy.

46:51.720 --> 46:54.960
- Jodie wanted to show me something.
- There is no Jodie, okay?

46:55.120 --> 46:56.960
- Yes, there is.
- No, there isn't!

46:57.120 --> 46:59.920
- You have to stop this!
- Jodie's real.

47:01.000 --> 47:04.280
- Jodie's real. She's...
- She is not real!

47:04.400 --> 47:06.320
Liar! Liar!

47:06.480 --> 47:08.080
Liar!

47:09.960 --> 47:11.920
I've seen her.

47:14.160 --> 47:16.120
She was gonna show me Daddy.

47:16.280 --> 47:18.680
I just wanted to see Daddy.

47:19.800 --> 47:21.840
Jodie promised to take me to Daddy.

47:22.000 --> 47:24.360
She says I can stay here
so we can play together...

47:24.560 --> 47:26.240
...forever and ever.

47:28.120 --> 47:30.080
Do you miss your daddy?

47:30.240 --> 47:31.680
Yes.

47:31.840 --> 47:35.000
- Do you miss your daddy a lot?
- Yes.

47:36.760 --> 47:38.920
I know you miss your daddy, baby.

47:40.120 --> 47:41.840
But no one can see him because...

47:42.480 --> 47:44.320
...he's in heaven.

47:45.600 --> 47:47.080
He's with the angels.

47:48.440 --> 47:50.720
He's with the angels.

47:54.720 --> 47:56.840
I just got so scared.

48:07.000 --> 48:08.560
What's the matter with you people?

48:18.160 --> 48:20.040
Wacko family.

48:49.280 --> 48:50.760
Father Callaway?

48:51.320 --> 48:52.840
Father.

48:53.680 --> 48:55.360
Kathy Lutz.

48:55.520 --> 48:56.920
Hello.

48:57.520 --> 48:59.360
Do you have a moment?

49:03.880 --> 49:06.720
It's my family.

49:07.160 --> 49:09.400
We've changed. It's...

49:09.600 --> 49:11.680
It's like we've grown apart.

49:12.760 --> 49:14.640
I don't think I understand.

49:18.000 --> 49:21.200
There's something...

49:21.880 --> 49:24.840
There's something evil in my house.

49:28.600 --> 49:30.640
I know it sounds...

49:30.840 --> 49:33.000
...crazy, I know that.

49:33.160 --> 49:35.280
I would think the same.

49:36.160 --> 49:37.840
I just don't know where else to go.

49:44.280 --> 49:46.320
There was a family...

49:46.720 --> 49:48.040
...lived here some time ago.

49:49.520 --> 49:51.720
They had a similar problem.

49:51.880 --> 49:53.280
The Defeos.

49:55.040 --> 49:56.680
You knew them?

49:58.640 --> 50:00.320
I'm living in their house.

50:07.800 --> 50:09.440
Now, hold it steady.

50:09.600 --> 50:12.440
Because if you get shaky,
I get shaky.

50:20.160 --> 50:21.720
Go!

50:26.880 --> 50:28.200
What, are you crying?

50:29.320 --> 50:31.920
Why are you crying?
That wasn't so bad.

50:32.440 --> 50:34.280
Pick up another log.

50:34.640 --> 50:36.040
Hurry up, pick up another log.

50:36.200 --> 50:37.760
Hurry up.

50:39.440 --> 50:42.120
Put your hands up there.
Put your hands up there.

50:42.480 --> 50:43.680
No.

50:44.120 --> 50:45.680
Put...

50:46.640 --> 50:49.520
We're friends.
We're having fun, right?

50:49.720 --> 50:51.120
Put your hands up there.

50:59.280 --> 51:01.120
Go!

51:56.920 --> 51:59.040
Come here, little girl.

52:04.240 --> 52:06.680
You're my favorite girl.

52:27.000 --> 52:28.440
<i>Catch them. </i>

52:28.600 --> 52:30.400
<i>Kill them. </i>

55:14.520 --> 55:16.120
George.

55:19.800 --> 55:21.840
I think there's something
seriously wrong here.

55:23.000 --> 55:25.040
Something's not right.

55:26.440 --> 55:28.200
What's not right?

55:31.640 --> 55:33.200
We need to get out of here.

55:33.400 --> 55:36.480
To just go. Just pack up and go.

55:37.840 --> 55:39.920
No, no, no.

55:40.240 --> 55:43.200
You know, you can't run away
from your problems, Kath.

55:45.160 --> 55:46.720
Please, let's go, George.

55:47.480 --> 55:50.320
- Somewhere. Anywhere.
- Did you hear that?

55:52.040 --> 55:54.800
Do you hear that squeak?
I gotta fix that squeak.

55:55.600 --> 55:58.840
Because, you know, these houses,
they're big...

56:00.080 --> 56:03.240
Big projects. Kath, and you
can't just walk away from it.

56:10.520 --> 56:12.280
How did you get so fucking stupid?

56:13.480 --> 56:15.240
What?

56:17.240 --> 56:21.040
Everything we have is in this house.
Everything.

56:21.200 --> 56:23.120
I'm not worried
about our goddamn money.

56:23.360 --> 56:24.720
Oh, our money.

56:25.600 --> 56:27.960
George, we're losing each other.

56:28.120 --> 56:29.960
Don't you see that?

56:30.680 --> 56:33.120
We stay here,
we'll have a house for the family...

56:33.280 --> 56:35.360
...only there won't be a family.

56:38.200 --> 56:40.640
It's always so cold in here.

56:42.120 --> 56:45.040
Would you let the stove alone
and pay attention to me?

56:45.240 --> 56:46.920
I'm not going anywhere,
neither are you.

56:47.080 --> 56:48.480
So shut up about that!

56:49.040 --> 56:50.560
Just shut up!

56:50.960 --> 56:52.360
Goddamn it.

56:52.880 --> 56:55.080
You're the one who wanted
this godforsaken house.

56:55.240 --> 56:56.520
Well, now you got it.

56:56.680 --> 56:58.320
Mom! Mom!

56:58.640 --> 57:00.640
Home sweet home.

57:04.520 --> 57:05.680
What is it, sweetie?

57:05.880 --> 57:08.040
We can't find Harry anywhere.
He's gone.

57:09.880 --> 57:11.760
I'll help you look in a sec, sweetie.

57:11.960 --> 57:13.880
You seen Harry, George?

57:14.560 --> 57:16.480
No, I haven't, Billy.

57:19.400 --> 57:21.000
Maybe he ran away.

57:21.160 --> 57:22.560
Harry never runs away, George.

57:23.600 --> 57:25.600
What's the matter with you, William?

57:25.760 --> 57:27.240
Get out of here now.

57:27.440 --> 57:31.360
- Now!
- Fine. Come on, Michael.

57:58.640 --> 58:01.200
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

58:15.320 --> 58:16.960
- Hello?
- Is your mommy home?

58:17.120 --> 58:18.480
Hold on a second.

58:18.960 --> 58:20.960
Mommy, there's someone
at the door.

58:21.120 --> 58:22.600
Who is it, honey?

58:24.280 --> 58:25.520
Come in, Father.

58:35.040 --> 58:36.720
This is gonna sound strange...

58:36.880 --> 58:40.520
...but you know the doll with one eye
that your daughter is holding?

58:40.800 --> 58:43.840
Well, that belonged to the little girl
who lived here before you.

58:44.200 --> 58:46.040
Yes, it was left here.

58:46.200 --> 58:49.040
No, Mrs. Lutz, it was not left here.

58:51.640 --> 58:54.080
Father, what exactly
are you trying to tell me?

58:54.240 --> 58:57.680
I knew the Defeos very well.
I presided over their funeral.

58:58.280 --> 59:00.680
Jodie Defeo was buried
with that doll.

59:10.920 --> 59:12.120
Oh, heavenly Father.

59:13.760 --> 59:15.680
Almighty God...

59:19.960 --> 59:22.280
...we ask you to bless...

59:23.800 --> 59:26.320
...and sanctify this house.

59:28.320 --> 59:33.160
To bless all who live here...

59:33.640 --> 59:38.320
...and to bring them the abundance
of all thy fruits.

01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:32.240
<i>Get out. </i>

01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:37.680
Father!

01:00:37.880 --> 01:00:39.480
Father!

01:00:42.560 --> 01:00:44.000
Why are you leaving us?

01:00:44.640 --> 01:00:46.320
What's the matter?

01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.680
It's okay. I'm here.

01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:19.280
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:01:19.480 --> 01:01:20.920
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:29.720
Oh, goddamn it, Harry!

01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.160
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:36.680
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:02:02.440 --> 01:02:04.400
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:02:05.720 --> 01:02:07.720
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:02:08.520 --> 01:02:10.520
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:02:43.800 --> 01:02:45.800
<i>There was a crime. A murder. </i>

01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.440
<i>You know, the town has moved on. </i>

01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.280
<i>And it is a distant memory now,</i>
<i>and the house is fine. </i>

01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:05.800
We don't open
for a few more minutes.

01:03:19.880 --> 01:03:22.000
"Voices told him to do it. "

01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:28.520
"He just moved into the basement. "

01:03:30.440 --> 01:03:32.720
"Twenty-eights days later
he killed them all. "

01:03:45.720 --> 01:03:46.880
Oh, my God.

01:04:35.800 --> 01:04:38.480
"Reverend Jeremiah Ketcham. "

01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.440
"He started a mission for Indians. "

01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:38.160
"He slaughtered them all. "

01:05:50.320 --> 01:05:53.600
"Over 20 bodies were found
in the lake. "

01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.040
<i>Catch them. </i>

01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:16.200
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.560
Father.

01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:47.600
Why did you run away
from my house?

01:06:50.520 --> 01:06:52.400
Why did you abandon us?

01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.160
Your house frightens me, Mrs. Lutz.

01:06:58.840 --> 01:07:02.800
I just read about this man,
Ketcham...

01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:07.440
...who tortured Indians on my land.
On my basement.

01:07:12.440 --> 01:07:15.000
I read about how he slit his throat...

01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.640
...so that his presence
would live forever.

01:07:17.800 --> 01:07:20.040
Do you believe this could be true?

01:07:20.360 --> 01:07:23.520
Ronnie Defeo came to me
weeks before the murders...

01:07:23.680 --> 01:07:28.520
...and he spoke about hearing voices
and seeing things in the house.

01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:31.240
I didn't believe him until yesterday.

01:07:33.160 --> 01:07:37.440
Mrs. Lutz, get you and your family
out of that house...

01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:38.880
...right now.

01:07:51.760 --> 01:07:52.920
- Hello?
<i>- George. </i>

01:07:53.080 --> 01:07:55.280
<i>George, I've just been to see</i>
<i>Father Callaway. </i>

01:07:55.440 --> 01:07:58.320
<i>Listen to me, you gotta get you</i>
<i>and the kids out of the house. </i>

01:07:59.440 --> 01:08:00.840
<i>George?</i>

01:08:02.120 --> 01:08:03.600
<i>Are you there? George?</i>

01:08:16.600 --> 01:08:20.840
Billy! Michael! Where's George?

01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.040
He's in the boathouse.

01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:43.120
George, we have
to get out of here now.

01:08:43.279 --> 01:08:44.800
George!

01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:24.840
Are you fucking crazy, George?

01:09:25.080 --> 01:09:26.600
Have you lost your mind?

01:09:26.760 --> 01:09:28.240
You tried to kill me.

01:09:33.279 --> 01:09:36.000
- Chelsea!
- Mommy! Mommy!

01:09:36.160 --> 01:09:37.479
I'm down here, Mommy!

01:09:38.760 --> 01:09:41.200
Chelsea, honey,
what are you doing down here?

01:10:08.200 --> 01:10:09.760
I think she misses her daddy.

01:10:12.920 --> 01:10:14.440
Don't you?

01:10:15.760 --> 01:10:17.520
Give me back my daughter.

01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:26.680
I wanna talk to you. Wait.
I wanna talk to you!

01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.840
Kids, get down here, now!

01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:31.760
Kids, get down here!

01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.160
- Billy, help me push this!
- Mom, where are you going?

01:10:37.560 --> 01:10:39.040
Billy!

01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.440
- Hurry. Go.
- Billy!

01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.720
Mom, why are you wet?

01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:48.160
Mommy! Mommy!

01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:51.960
Come on, Mom!

01:10:53.400 --> 01:10:54.680
Hurry.

01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:57.720
Billy, come on!

01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:13.080
Run! Go, go, go!

01:11:15.800 --> 01:11:17.360
You're stuck! You're stuck!

01:11:17.760 --> 01:11:19.320
Stay here!

01:11:21.800 --> 01:11:22.960
Great!

01:11:23.800 --> 01:11:27.440
Let go of my mom, you bastard!
Let go right now! Let go.

01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.400
- What the hell is your problem?
- Let's go.

01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:37.040
These kids are out of control.

01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:42.320
- Mom, it's stuck!
- It won't open!

01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:46.280
Where's Chelsea? Chelsea!

01:11:59.240 --> 01:12:03.520
- Hurry, hurry, Billy. Hurry.
- Come on. Let's go. Be quiet, be quiet.

01:12:46.440 --> 01:12:48.240
Billy!

01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:34.320
I want you to hold on tight.

01:13:44.680 --> 01:13:46.320
Jump, baby.

01:13:48.600 --> 01:13:49.880
- Come on, honey.
- Come on.

01:13:50.040 --> 01:13:51.560
- Come on, Michael.
- No, Mommy.

01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.680
- No.
- Hurry, baby.

01:13:54.600 --> 01:13:56.920
Come on, Michael.
Come on, Michael.

01:13:58.040 --> 01:13:59.720
- Come on, hurry.
- Let's get out of here.

01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:04.880
- Come here. Come here.
- No.

01:14:07.560 --> 01:14:09.800
You leave him alone.

01:14:13.760 --> 01:14:15.280
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:14:16.120 --> 01:14:17.800
Don't hurt him!

01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:21.800
Back the fuck up!

01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.360
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:13.600
Hurry. Let's grab some rope.

01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:17.280
<i>Kill them. </i>

01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:37.920
Kathy, kill me!

01:15:38.600 --> 01:15:40.560
You kill me, or I'll kill you!

01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:43.000
Nobody's dying today.

01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:06.760
Okay, let's get him in the boat.

01:16:29.920 --> 01:16:32.000
Why are we taking him?
Let's just leave him here.

01:16:32.160 --> 01:16:35.400
I can't explain it to you right now. We
have to get him away from the house.

01:17:31.800 --> 01:17:33.840
Don't even look at it, Kathy.

01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:35.520
Let's get out of here.
