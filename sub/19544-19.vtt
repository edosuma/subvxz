00:07.716 --> 00:11.004
To get to the command center,
where Babidi and Dabra are,

00:11.220 --> 00:13.256
one must pass through a number of stages

00:13.472 --> 00:16.178
and defeat the enemies that
appear in order to advance.

00:16.392 --> 00:20.351
|n Stage One, Vegeta overwhelmed Puipui;

00:20.562 --> 00:25.682
in Stage Two, Goku beat
the magical beast Yakon.

00:27.000 --> 00:33.074

01:53.238 --> 01:58.403
"Whither Victory? A Battle Royal
Championship Match!!"

02:01.580 --> 02:03.036
That was incredible, Father!

02:03.248 --> 02:06.160
Your Ki was tremendous when you
defeated that monster just now.

02:06.376 --> 02:07.161
I suppose...

02:07.377 --> 02:10.244
Sure enough, that Kakarrot bastard
has overcome the barrier--

02:10.464 --> 02:12.705
the Super Saiyan barrier.

02:14.676 --> 02:19.796
H-He blew up...! Y-Yakon...!
How did he blow up?!

02:20.015 --> 02:24.304
He was a fool. It appears he played
right into his enemy's hand.

02:24.520 --> 02:27.728
He devoured more of that light energy
than his capacity allowed.

02:27.940 --> 02:31.182
Th-That's not it!
Something wasn't right just then!

02:31.401 --> 02:37.237
|-|n that last instant,
Yakon all of a sudden ballooned up!

02:37.449 --> 02:42.443
Th-Those guys are not normal! | just know it...

02:42.663 --> 02:47.908
All right, very well. Allow me to
relieve your anxiety, Babidi-sama.

02:52.089 --> 02:56.503
Hmm... I, personally, will go
and attend to Stage Three.

02:56.718 --> 02:59.846
And then, in no time at all, Majin Boo's ball

03:00.055 --> 03:01.886
will be filled with their energy.

03:02.099 --> 03:07.560
D-Dabra... if you get done in,
then it's all over for me!

03:07.771 --> 03:09.272
You're sure you can beat them, right?

03:09.481 --> 03:10.982
Am I sure?

03:12.317 --> 03:15.354
I am the King of the Demon Realm, Dabra!

03:15.571 --> 03:18.233
Whether they have 3,000 kilis or 4,000 kilis,

03:18.448 --> 03:22.612
there is no one in the world
whose power is superior to my own!

03:23.745 --> 03:27.533
I wonder what kind of guy
will be coming out this time.

03:27.749 --> 03:28.784
Gohan...

03:29.001 --> 03:30.491
It's your turn now.

03:30.711 --> 03:35.375
Goku-san, this is not a game.
The men under Babidi

03:35.591 --> 03:39.129
are all select warriors
from across the universe.

03:39.344 --> 03:40.845
It is nice that you have beaten them so far,

03:41.054 --> 03:44.171
but from here on, let's all fight together!

03:44.391 --> 03:47.474
Hey, don't worry, Kaioshin-sama.

03:47.686 --> 03:50.018
Besides, it would be unfair, wouldn't it?

03:50.230 --> 03:51.265
Unfair?

03:51.481 --> 03:55.269
Yeah. What with me and Vegeta
getting to fight alone,

03:55.485 --> 03:57.771
but Gohan being stuck with us joining in.

03:57.988 --> 04:02.106
He's right, Kaioshin-sama.
Please, leave this to me.

04:07.080 --> 04:09.366
All right, I'll do my best!

04:13.462 --> 04:15.544
Okay, Dabra, go ahead.

04:15.756 --> 04:19.214
All right, then. I swear to
deal with them, personally!

04:19.426 --> 04:22.088
H-Huh? Dabra-sama, where are you going?

04:22.304 --> 04:24.545
The way up to the stages is this way.

04:24.765 --> 04:26.881
It's okay, let him go.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.137
A-A meditation room?

04:33.482 --> 04:38.067
| see! Dabra-sama is going to
boost his Ki before fighting!

04:43.867 --> 04:46.233
Absolutely nobody is allowed
to open that door again

04:46.453 --> 04:48.409
until Dabra says it's okay.

04:48.622 --> 04:49.407
Yes, sir!

04:49.623 --> 04:52.615
He's getting himself motivated.

04:52.834 --> 04:54.449
Once he gets serious,

04:54.670 --> 04:58.504
it will be a simple matter for him
to eliminate those three.

05:01.885 --> 05:02.670
They're taking their time.

05:02.886 --> 05:04.968
How long are they going to make us wait?

05:05.180 --> 05:07.387
Don't be in such a hurry.

05:07.599 --> 05:11.183
I'm sure they're getting a
hotshot warrior ready for you.

05:11.395 --> 05:15.229
By the way, I wonder what's going on
at the Tenkaichi Budokai.

05:15.440 --> 05:17.692
We did all pull out of it together.

05:17.901 --> 05:22.019
Hmph! I wanted to fight you
at the Tenkaichi Budokai,

05:22.239 --> 05:25.356
not face the disappointing bastards
we're getting in here!

05:25.575 --> 05:28.908
l was looking forward to
fighting you, too, Father.

05:29.121 --> 05:30.736
The same goes for me, too.

05:30.956 --> 05:33.789
I wonder if No. 18-san
is getting along all right.

05:34.001 --> 05:37.334
These people enjoy fighting.

05:37.546 --> 05:41.380
Saiyans really do love to fight.

05:43.260 --> 05:47.754
Ladies and gentlemen,
please be quiet! Please be quiet!

05:47.973 --> 05:50.214
Now, until the situation becomes clearer,

05:50.434 --> 05:53.597
for the moment, the Tenkaichi Budokai
will be taking a break!

05:53.812 --> 05:55.803
What are you doing?! Get on with it!

05:56.023 --> 05:58.685
Get going! Hurry up!

05:59.860 --> 06:04.149
A break, huh? I wanted to hurry up
and fight in a match, too.

06:04.364 --> 06:06.275
This is your big brother's fault!

06:06.491 --> 06:08.356
It's all because he got
beaten by those weirdos!

06:08.577 --> 06:09.987
It is not either Big Brother's fault!

06:10.203 --> 06:13.536
If that hadn't happened,
the matches would have kept going!

06:13.749 --> 06:15.489
Don't you say bad things about Big Brother!

06:15.709 --> 06:17.495
Ow! Now you've done it, you little...!

06:17.711 --> 06:20.202
Ow, that hurts!

06:26.344 --> 06:28.050
--What was that?
--What happened?

06:32.768 --> 06:35.384
Are you all right, Mighty Mask-san?

06:35.604 --> 06:38.186
Ow-w-w-w. . .!

06:38.398 --> 06:39.433
Are you hurt?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.810
No, l-l'm fine!

06:43.028 --> 06:44.564
Get it together!

06:44.780 --> 06:46.145
No, you get it together!

06:46.364 --> 06:48.195
Ow! Walk right, will you?!

06:48.408 --> 06:51.024
Does he seem out of sorts somehow?

06:56.374 --> 06:58.535
--...told the others fighters yet?
--We're just about to.

06:58.752 --> 07:00.208
Say, Trunks-kun...

07:00.420 --> 07:04.083
--Huh?
--|'m getting thirsty. Let's take a break.

07:04.299 --> 07:06.039
Yeah, okay.

07:06.259 --> 07:10.423
The two of us pretending to be
one person is pretty exhausting.

07:10.639 --> 07:12.345
That way, that way!

07:13.975 --> 07:15.590
This way, this way!

07:19.648 --> 07:24.483
Oh, right, I should tell
Contestant Mighty Mask about this.

07:24.694 --> 07:26.400
This way, this way!

07:28.573 --> 07:30.359
ln here, in here!

07:33.620 --> 07:36.157
All right, nobody is in here.

07:40.502 --> 07:41.992
There he is.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.959
Come on, Trunks-kun! Hurry and get down!

07:47.175 --> 07:49.552
Just a second! Don't be in such a rush!

07:49.761 --> 07:50.625
Yeah, but...

07:50.846 --> 07:53.007
Hmm? Children's voices?

07:53.223 --> 07:55.680
Right, right, so sorry!

07:58.603 --> 08:03.643
Oh, I'm so busy, I'm so busy!
Man, people are so messy! I do declare!

08:03.859 --> 08:07.192
Um, I'm in a hurry here myself.

08:13.785 --> 08:16.322
Yay! Juice! Juice!

08:18.665 --> 08:21.202
Let's see...

08:21.418 --> 08:22.533
This one!

08:22.752 --> 08:24.583
For Pete's sake...

08:24.796 --> 08:26.661
Contestant Mighty Mask?

08:35.140 --> 08:40.054
Huh? You two? Trunks-kun
and Goten-kun, wasn't it?

08:40.270 --> 08:41.054
Y-Yes!

08:41.270 --> 08:44.604
Only contestants who are competing
are supposed to come in here.

08:44.816 --> 08:49.480
Oh, uh, w-we wanted to get
Mister Satan's autograph!

08:49.696 --> 08:50.981
Ah, yes, that's right!

08:51.198 --> 08:53.234
Hmm, well, okay.

08:53.450 --> 08:56.908
You both got such high marks
in the junior division, after all.

08:58.997 --> 09:01.329
Oh, by the way, where is
Contestant Mighty Mask?

09:01.541 --> 09:04.408
I know I saw him go into this room.

09:07.005 --> 09:09.747
Isn't this Contestant Mighty Mask's...?

09:11.134 --> 09:12.840
Where could he have gone?

09:13.053 --> 09:16.796
Oh, uh, you see... that is...

09:17.015 --> 09:20.007
Mighty Mask-san! Where are you?

09:25.899 --> 09:27.355
Oh, he's in the shower.

09:27.567 --> 09:29.728
Well, let's see... Mighty Mask-san!

09:29.945 --> 09:32.903
Whoa! No! No! No!

09:33.114 --> 09:35.605
He'll be very mad at you if you peek!

09:35.825 --> 09:39.363
Hmm? Oh, right. Masked contestants
hate nothing more

09:39.579 --> 09:43.492
than having their real faces seen.
Gotcha, gotcha.

09:44.876 --> 09:46.958
Well, Mighty Mask-san!

09:47.170 --> 09:48.831
Mighty-san!

09:50.298 --> 09:51.629
W-What?

09:51.841 --> 09:55.584
Ah, hi there. We're not sure when
the tournament will reconvene,

09:55.804 --> 09:57.760
so please do not head out anywhere, okay?

09:57.973 --> 09:59.429
Yeah, all right.

09:59.641 --> 10:01.302
That takes care of that.

10:02.769 --> 10:06.978
Now then... Don't roam around
here too long, you two, okay?

10:07.190 --> 10:08.691
Right!

10:13.280 --> 10:15.396
They haven't returned for nearly an hour now.

10:15.615 --> 10:16.650
They must be disqualified.

10:16.866 --> 10:20.154
But there are only five others remaining.

10:20.370 --> 10:23.407
Oh, what's goin' on?
Are they about to begin yet?

10:23.623 --> 10:27.662
Not yet. It doesn't look like Goku
and the others have come back.

10:27.877 --> 10:30.414
Really, where could Goku-sa have gone off to?

10:30.630 --> 10:34.714
Hmm, something seems
to be happening, all right.

10:34.926 --> 10:38.293
There are a number of large Ki
gathered together, far away.

10:41.766 --> 10:44.553
Oh? What's this? Everyone's
gotten back together again.

10:44.769 --> 10:46.054
It's a good thing we made it back in time.

10:46.271 --> 10:51.265
Hmph, the people who left are
all afraid of me, Mister Satan!

10:51.484 --> 10:54.146
In that regard, it's fair to say that all of you

10:54.362 --> 10:56.978
who stayed here are truly courageous.

10:57.198 --> 11:00.156
Th-That's quite an honor, Mister Satan!

11:00.368 --> 11:01.699
Tch, speak for yourself!

11:01.911 --> 11:03.776
Oh, I've got it!

11:05.915 --> 11:08.076
Rest at ease, all of you spectators!

11:08.293 --> 11:12.332
As long as |, Mister Satan,
remain here, there is no problem!

11:12.547 --> 11:16.506
You came here to see my strength, didn't you?!

11:17.927 --> 11:19.383
That's right, Mister Satan!

11:19.596 --> 11:23.714
Way to go! That's right!
Show us your elegant moves!

11:28.563 --> 11:33.648
How does this sound, you guys?
I, Mister Satan, have a great idea.

11:33.860 --> 11:36.602
Oh, Mister Satan. What is it?

11:36.821 --> 11:38.561
A battle royal.

11:38.782 --> 11:42.866
Declare right now that the cowards
who have run away are disqualified,

11:43.078 --> 11:45.364
and let all five of the
courageous remaining contestants

11:45.580 --> 11:46.786
fight it out in the ring.

11:46.998 --> 11:48.499
You can't make the tournament exciting

11:48.708 --> 11:50.244
with just five contestants, right?

11:50.460 --> 11:54.874
But a battle royal will hit
the spot dead-on! Dead-on!

11:55.090 --> 11:56.705
Ah, that's it!

11:56.925 --> 11:58.165
A splendid idea!

11:58.385 --> 12:00.842
B-But then...

12:01.054 --> 12:03.010
If we do a battle royal, then, you know...

12:03.223 --> 12:07.592
W-What? You have some sort of
problem with Mister Satan's idea?

12:07.811 --> 12:08.721
N-No...

12:08.937 --> 12:12.521
Okay, fine. In that case, I'll just go home.

12:12.732 --> 12:16.316
N-No, not at all! |-|t is a spectacular idea!

12:16.528 --> 12:18.814
All right, that settles it!
Make the announcement!

12:19.030 --> 12:20.065
Right!

12:20.281 --> 12:24.399
Ladies and gentlemen!
Thank you for waiting so terribly long!

12:24.619 --> 12:27.031
Just now, at Mister Satan's suggestion,

12:27.247 --> 12:29.784
it was decided that the
remaining five contestants

12:29.999 --> 12:31.990
will compete in a battle royal!

12:32.210 --> 12:34.166
All five will fight in the ring,

12:34.379 --> 12:38.338
and the last contestant remaining
will be declared the victor!

12:38.550 --> 12:40.791
Way to go! That's Mister Satan for you!

12:41.010 --> 12:42.921
Well said!

12:43.138 --> 12:44.628
Did he say a battle royal?

12:44.848 --> 12:49.808
A-Are they goin' to start before
Goku-sa and Gohan-chan come back?

12:50.019 --> 12:51.680
I don't see that they have much choice.

12:51.896 --> 12:55.388
Then we won't be earnin' any prize money!

12:56.443 --> 12:58.604
Our family finances are busted.

12:58.820 --> 13:02.859
Wow, I've got to hand it to you,
Mister Satan--a battle royal!

13:03.074 --> 13:05.451
I admire you for your courageous suggestion.

13:05.660 --> 13:06.991
Huh? Courageous?

13:07.203 --> 13:10.741
Why, yes, Mister Satan.
In a battle royal situation,

13:10.957 --> 13:13.869
all four of the others will work
together to come after you,

13:14.085 --> 13:16.872
since you're the favorite to win.

13:20.175 --> 13:22.040
If I were afraid of that,

13:22.260 --> 13:24.421
I couldn't call myself the true champion!

13:24.637 --> 13:25.467
Indeed.

13:25.680 --> 13:29.172
O-O-Oh, crap...!

13:40.069 --> 13:42.811
All right then, let's go ahead
and introduce the five contestants

13:43.031 --> 13:45.613
who will be competing in the battle royal!

13:45.825 --> 13:49.192
First, as everyone knows,
the champion, Mister Satan!

13:49.412 --> 13:52.620
Hmm? I've got to really make this look good!

13:57.837 --> 14:00.249
Ee-yow!

14:01.257 --> 14:04.340
Yeah! Yeah! Yeah!

14:04.552 --> 14:07.635
Next, the only female
contestant at this tournament,

14:07.847 --> 14:10.884
the woman with the unusual name,
Contestant No. 18!

14:11.100 --> 14:13.807
Oh, hang in there, cutie!

14:14.020 --> 14:15.885
--Hmph.
--No. 18!

14:16.105 --> 14:20.223
--Good luck!
--Mommy! Win!

14:20.443 --> 14:22.525
Next up, Contestant Mighty Mask,

14:22.737 --> 14:26.321
who was beaten in the first round
of the last tournament!

14:26.533 --> 14:30.401
Oh, that's us! All right,
let's make this look cool!

14:30.620 --> 14:32.110
Uh-huh!

14:37.794 --> 14:39.955
Don't overexert yourself, Mighty Mask!

14:40.171 --> 14:42.787
In addition, Contestant Killa,
who was eliminated in the second round

14:43.007 --> 14:45.714
of the previous tournament!

14:45.927 --> 14:47.542
Killa! Drop out!

14:47.762 --> 14:49.673
Finally, a man popular among the ladies,

14:49.889 --> 14:52.505
who came close in the last tournament

14:52.725 --> 14:54.886
but was bested by Mister Satan,
Contestant Jewel!

14:55.103 --> 14:58.846
--Ah! It's Jewel-sama!
--How handsome!

14:59.065 --> 15:03.729
The battle royal will be held
with these five contestants.

15:03.945 --> 15:10.236
Just who from among these five
contestants will obtain victory?!

15:17.292 --> 15:18.873
Okay, it's about to start!

15:19.085 --> 15:21.872
Let's win the adult division, too, Trunks-kun!

15:22.088 --> 15:23.123
Yeah!

15:23.339 --> 15:25.876
Hey, let's start by working together

15:26.092 --> 15:28.629
to knock Mister Satan-sama
out of bounds. Okay?

15:28.845 --> 15:32.303
Shut up. That guy doesn't even matter.

15:32.515 --> 15:34.927
The only one to watch out for is No. 18-san.

15:35.143 --> 15:36.474
--Right?
--Right!

15:36.686 --> 15:40.520
W-What's with that guy? He sure talks funny!

15:41.899 --> 15:44.436
Bonjour, my beautiful young lady.

15:44.652 --> 15:49.066
It's so wrong for someone
as fair as you to fight.

15:49.282 --> 15:50.271
What do you say?

15:50.491 --> 15:53.198
After the match, how about
you and I get something to eat?

15:53.411 --> 15:55.652
Get lost. You're repulsive.

15:55.872 --> 15:58.204
W-W-What did you say?!

15:58.416 --> 16:01.874
And now, let's have the champion match,

16:02.086 --> 16:07.376
a five-man battle royal with
no time limit, begin at once!

16:07.592 --> 16:09.708
--Ki|la!
--Good luck, Mighty Mask!

16:09.927 --> 16:11.758
--Cutie!
--No. 18!

16:11.971 --> 16:12.960
Jewel-sama!

16:13.181 --> 16:14.671
--How handsome!
--Why, that woman!

16:14.891 --> 16:17.223
Rebuff my invitation, will she?!

16:17.435 --> 16:19.050
Lousy Mighty Mask!

16:19.270 --> 16:23.434
Since when has he had such
a smart mouth, damn him?

16:25.318 --> 16:28.060
Satan! Satan!...

16:28.279 --> 16:32.022
I-If you're coming at me,
then bring it on! I'll take you!

16:32.241 --> 16:33.447
Come and get me!

16:33.660 --> 16:35.742
Match start!

16:39.624 --> 16:41.114
Huh?

16:54.847 --> 16:57.884
Oh, my! What just happened?!

16:58.101 --> 17:00.592
As soon as the match began,
Contestants Jewel and Killa

17:00.812 --> 17:02.143
were eliminated!

17:02.355 --> 17:05.142
--Gah! Jewel-sama!
--Ki|la!

17:05.358 --> 17:08.599
That lady is awesome, for such a cute face!

17:08.819 --> 17:11.277
Contestant Mighty Mask is no slouch, either.

17:11.489 --> 17:14.652
Yay! Mommy, looking good!

17:14.867 --> 17:16.482
Way to go, No.18!

17:16.703 --> 17:17.818
Keep it up!

17:18.037 --> 17:20.574
Mommy, good luck!

17:20.790 --> 17:26.830
L-Lucky me! I don't know why,
but two of those pests are eliminated!

17:27.046 --> 17:30.379
Now, only these two crumb-balls are left.

17:30.591 --> 17:33.378
I'm going to win this...!

17:33.594 --> 17:37.132
That guy with the unusually
long torso is no easy customer.

17:37.348 --> 17:40.431
There was unthinkable punching power
behind those tiny arms.

17:40.643 --> 17:44.682
Stay sharp, Goten.
I heard that Kuririn-san's wife

17:44.897 --> 17:47.013
was stronger than our papas a long time ago.

17:47.233 --> 17:48.734
Uh-huh, I got it.

17:48.943 --> 17:51.184
All right, come at me, the both of you!

17:51.404 --> 17:53.565
I'll take care of you all at once!

17:53.781 --> 17:55.066
Ignore that one.

17:55.283 --> 17:56.773
Uh-huh.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.332
Okay, three contestants remain!

18:06.544 --> 18:08.705
Contestant Mighty Mask!

18:08.921 --> 18:10.832
Contestant No.18!

18:11.048 --> 18:14.586
And the champion, Contestant Mister Satan!

18:14.802 --> 18:17.635
Which one of these three
contestants will survive

18:17.847 --> 18:20.008
and be the one to secure victory?!

18:21.768 --> 18:24.225
Without a doubt, I will be the winner.

18:24.437 --> 18:28.555
All that remains is how to
look good doing it! Let's see...

18:28.775 --> 18:30.185
First, I'll take that masked punk

18:30.401 --> 18:33.814
and defeat him with moves
much showier than necessary.

18:38.951 --> 18:41.658
Then I'll take the cutie-pie
who is shocked at my strength

18:41.871 --> 18:45.989
and knock her out of the ring like a gentleman.

18:47.460 --> 18:51.123
I'll captivate both the cutie-pie
and the spectators!

18:52.882 --> 18:55.339
Oh, my! It's Mister Satan!

18:55.551 --> 18:57.382
He is already declaring his victory!

18:57.595 --> 19:01.759
I nailed it! I nailed it like crazy!

19:03.142 --> 19:04.382
What is he, dense?

19:04.602 --> 19:06.342
Let's just leave him be.

19:06.562 --> 19:11.397
All right! I'll start by defeating you,
you masked punk!

19:11.609 --> 19:15.397
I hate to do it, but the competitive
world is without pity!

19:17.532 --> 19:21.024
All right, our opponent is
No. 18-san! Got it, Goten?

19:21.244 --> 19:23.200
--Okay!
--Here I come!

19:26.999 --> 19:29.251
Satan Punch!!

19:33.673 --> 19:35.459
She sure is strong, all right!

19:36.968 --> 19:37.957
Hit her back!

19:38.177 --> 19:40.634
I know! Here goes!

19:44.684 --> 19:46.549
--They're good!
--|ncredible!

19:46.769 --> 19:51.433
lf Goku-sa isn't fightin',
then let's root for No. 18 instead!

19:51.649 --> 19:54.356
Hang in there, No. 18-san!

19:54.569 --> 19:57.811
--Go! Go! Hang in there!
--Mommy! Good luck!
--Yay! Yay!

19:58.823 --> 20:00.313
Hmm?

20:01.909 --> 20:03.115
C-Could it be...?

20:03.327 --> 20:05.363
You idiot! Not that way! Go right!

20:05.580 --> 20:07.696
That's easy for you to say!

20:09.917 --> 20:12.078
--Yikes!
--We' re gonna lose!

20:12.295 --> 20:13.785
All right!

20:15.923 --> 20:19.541
They're flying! Those two are
both flying through the air!

20:36.027 --> 20:37.608
Just what is going on here?

20:37.820 --> 20:39.151
Let's just smash it open!

20:39.363 --> 20:40.944
Y-You mustn't do that!

20:41.157 --> 20:42.192
I can't wait around forever!

20:42.408 --> 20:46.026
B-But you cannot just go
smashing it, or anything!

20:47.121 --> 20:48.952
It would be more dangerous
to provoke them unnecessarily.

20:49.165 --> 20:50.496
They're chafing at this, huh?

20:50.708 --> 20:52.289
Is Dabra done yet?

20:52.501 --> 20:55.459
Sir, he is still within the meditation room!

20:55.671 --> 20:59.414
Good, good! Dabra, boost your Ki even higher!

20:59.634 --> 21:01.499
Higher and higher!

21:07.600 --> 21:10.637
The King of the Demon Realm, Dabra,

21:10.853 --> 21:14.846
sits in the meditation room
and raises his Ki before fighting.

21:15.066 --> 21:19.730
Looking forward to his attack is Gohan.

21:19.946 --> 21:21.652
It's hard to fight like this!

21:21.864 --> 21:24.150
Elsewhere, who will come out on top

21:24.367 --> 21:28.576
of the Tenkaichi Budokai battle royal?
Will it be No. 18?

21:28.788 --> 21:30.403
Will it be Mighty Mask?

21:30.623 --> 21:33.956
Or will it be Mister Satan?

22:42.028 --> 22:43.438
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:43.654 --> 22:46.031
Who exactly is that Mighty Mask guy?

22:46.240 --> 22:48.151
How can he fight head-to-head against No. 18?

22:48.367 --> 22:51.734
Way to go, Goten!
The two of us have this thing won!

22:51.954 --> 22:54.536
Ungh, this guy moves in the strangest ways!

22:54.749 --> 22:55.534
What?!

22:55.750 --> 22:57.286
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:57.501 --> 23:00.709
"Stunning Youngsters!! No. 18's Uphill Battle."

23:00.921 --> 23:03.298
Oh, man! I thought they
were keeping out of sight,

23:03.507 --> 23:05.589
but that's where they are?!

23:06.305 --> 23:12.366
