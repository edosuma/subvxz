00:53.734 --> 00:55.100

02:32.634 --> 02:35.467
- okay, can i ask you
a question?

02:35.467 --> 02:39.767
I have been wanting to ask you
for a long time.

02:39.767 --> 02:41.033
- oh, sure, anything.

02:41.033 --> 02:44.601
- um...that friday

02:44.601 --> 02:47.133
Before you left,

02:47.133 --> 02:48.601
You took a shirt
to the drycleaners,

02:48.601 --> 02:50.367
Short, number four.

02:50.367 --> 02:53.100
Sharona, they said
they never got it.

02:53.100 --> 02:55.467
- that's what you've been
waiting to ask me about?

02:55.467 --> 02:57.267
- it looked
a lot like this shirt,

02:57.267 --> 02:58.601
But it was number four.

02:58.601 --> 03:00.033
- no, no, no.
uh, you know what?

03:00.033 --> 03:01.234
I remember.

03:01.234 --> 03:02.801
I took it
to your drycleaner.

03:02.801 --> 03:04.234
And they were closed,

03:04.234 --> 03:05.667
So i took it to another one
down the street.

03:05.667 --> 03:06.801
- oh!

03:06.801 --> 03:08.033
[both laughing]

03:08.033 --> 03:10.300
So, adrian,
how have you been?

03:10.300 --> 03:11.300
You look great.

03:11.300 --> 03:12.667
- thank you.

03:12.667 --> 03:14.334
Do you remember the name
of that establishment,

03:14.334 --> 03:15.367
The other cleaners?

03:15.367 --> 03:16.634
- no, i don't remember

03:16.634 --> 03:17.901
- do you have the ticket?

03:17.901 --> 03:20.501
I know, you always--
you always, um,

03:20.501 --> 03:24.567
You know, put the tickets
in your purse.

03:24.567 --> 03:25.901
Um...

03:25.901 --> 03:27.133
- yeah, but it's
been five years.

03:27.133 --> 03:28.667
This is not even
the same purse.

03:28.667 --> 03:30.067
- oh, yeah.

03:30.067 --> 03:32.200
- okay, fine.
fine.

03:32.200 --> 03:35.667
Fine.

03:35.667 --> 03:37.767
You know what?
it's not here.

03:37.767 --> 03:38.868
It's not here.

03:38.868 --> 03:40.801
But it might be
in the garage at home

03:40.801 --> 03:42.300
Where i keep
all of my old stuff.

03:42.300 --> 03:44.167
So when i go home,
i'll check for it.

03:44.167 --> 03:45.634
All right?

03:45.634 --> 03:47.601
Oh!
- you got it, you found it.

03:47.601 --> 03:49.367
- no, picture of benjy.

03:49.367 --> 03:51.200
- oh.
- can you believe it?

03:51.200 --> 03:52.901
He's looking
at colleges now.

03:52.901 --> 03:54.400
- [chuckles]

03:54.400 --> 03:56.200
- the only question
is can i afford to send him?

03:56.200 --> 03:58.267
That's always the question.

03:58.267 --> 04:01.901
- look at him.
he's all grown up.

04:01.901 --> 04:03.534
Where is he now?

04:03.534 --> 04:05.701
- um, he's home,
working a summer job.

04:05.701 --> 04:08.467
- is he anywhere near
that garage?

04:08.467 --> 04:12.767
- adrian...

04:12.767 --> 04:14.801
I promise you,
when i get home,

04:14.801 --> 04:16.067
I'm gonna check the garage.

04:16.067 --> 04:17.500
I promise you.

04:17.500 --> 04:20.267
But will you please
forget about the ticket?

04:20.267 --> 04:22.100
Okay?
- [whistles]

04:22.100 --> 04:25.100
- you haven't changed at all.
- oh, well--

04:25.100 --> 04:27.400
- not at all.
i mean, it's--it's amazing.

04:27.400 --> 04:29.734
Even the apartment.
it's exactly the same.

04:29.734 --> 04:31.133
It's amazing.

04:31.133 --> 04:32.334
- no, that's not true,
actually.

04:32.334 --> 04:34.400
I switched to 75 watt bulbs
in the hallway.

04:34.400 --> 04:36.434
- really?
- oh, yeah; oh, yeah.

04:36.434 --> 04:38.133
- oh, that is something.
- well--

04:38.133 --> 04:39.734
- no, that is real progress,
adrian.

04:39.734 --> 04:40.968
I am very proud of you.

04:40.968 --> 04:43.567
- i didn't like it...

04:43.567 --> 04:45.801
So i changed back.

04:45.801 --> 04:49.400
- oh.

04:49.400 --> 04:51.467
"so, sharona, how
are you doing?

04:51.467 --> 04:52.701
What have you been up to?"

04:52.701 --> 04:54.534
Oh, well, thank you
very much for asking.

04:54.534 --> 04:57.734
Um...i am still

04:57.734 --> 04:58.801
And i'm nursing again.

04:58.801 --> 05:01.334

- mm-hmm.

05:01.334 --> 05:04.300
- but isn't benjy

05:05.968 --> 05:08.434
- no...i'm working
as a nurse.

05:08.434 --> 05:09.868
- oh, well,
that's different.

05:09.868 --> 05:11.400
- i'm an administrator.

05:11.400 --> 05:13.467
I--i'm--i manage
a veterans hospital.

05:13.467 --> 05:14.467
- i get it, yeah.

05:14.467 --> 05:15.767
Oh, well, they must...

05:15.767 --> 05:17.834
They're very lucky
to have you.

05:17.834 --> 05:19.934
And trevor--
how's trevor?

05:19.934 --> 05:21.934
- oh, we're separated
for good this time.

05:21.934 --> 05:23.100
- oh...

05:23.100 --> 05:24.167
- no, no, no, no.

05:24.167 --> 05:27.133
This was the best thing
for both of us.

05:27.133 --> 05:29.767
You still have some
schmutz over there.

05:29.767 --> 05:31.434
- wh-where?
- right there.

05:31.434 --> 05:32.634
Hold on, hold on.

05:39.133 --> 05:40.200
- hey.

05:40.200 --> 05:41.200
- hmm?

05:41.200 --> 05:42.601
- you still got it.

05:42.601 --> 05:44.534
- it's like riding a bike.

05:44.534 --> 05:46.901
- [laughing]
oh, man.

05:46.901 --> 05:51.434
- a very clean,
very unusual...

05:51.434 --> 05:52.968
Very sad bike.

05:52.968 --> 05:54.934
Is it off?

05:54.934 --> 05:56.300

hear you come in.

06:09.534 --> 06:11.234
It--i-i'm...

06:11.234 --> 06:13.167
Um, it's not

06:15.234 --> 06:17.267

06:17.267 --> 06:19.534
This is sharona.

06:19.534 --> 06:21.567

06:21.567 --> 06:23.067

06:24.767 --> 06:26.801
I'm natalie teeger.
- oh, my god!

06:26.801 --> 06:28.133
- i feel like
i'm meeting a celebrity.

06:28.133 --> 06:29.133
[laughs]

06:29.133 --> 06:30.501
- it's so nice to meet you.

06:30.501 --> 06:31.601

06:33.167 --> 06:36.400
Okay, she got me the wipe.
it's just a wipe.

06:36.400 --> 06:38.667
I mean, come on.
there's nothing going on.

06:38.667 --> 06:40.033
Sometimes a wipe
is just a wipe.

06:40.033 --> 06:41.234
I'm talking too much.

06:41.234 --> 06:43.601
Am i still talking now?
god, i'm still talking.

06:43.601 --> 06:45.501
- mr. monk, it's okay
if sharona hands you a wipe.

06:45.501 --> 06:46.968
- yeah, what--

06:46.968 --> 06:49.434
- so how long
are you here for?

06:49.434 --> 06:51.100
- um, a day, maybe two.

06:51.100 --> 06:52.934
- just a day!

06:52.934 --> 06:54.200
- you know, i'm gonna

06:54.200 --> 06:55.501
'cause my uncle howie died.

06:55.501 --> 06:56.901
- oh, i'm so sorry.

06:56.901 --> 06:59.234
- yeah, well, you know,
i wasn't very close to him

06:59.234 --> 07:01.067
And i didn't really
know him that well.

07:01.067 --> 07:02.868
But, you know, i was
the only family he had.

07:02.868 --> 07:04.534
So that's why i'm here.
- yeah.

07:04.534 --> 07:06.133
- oh, so you're here
to claim the body?

07:06.133 --> 07:07.200
- no, he's already
been cremated.

07:07.200 --> 07:08.534
- yeah.

07:08.534 --> 07:09.834
- he died at the eastdale
country club.

07:09.834 --> 07:11.200
Have you ever been there?

07:11.200 --> 07:13.167
- me? no, i couldn't afford
to park my car there.

07:13.167 --> 07:15.200
Not on my salary.
- oh, yes.

07:15.200 --> 07:16.367
I'm sorry, i forgot.

07:16.367 --> 07:17.534
You work for ebenezer monk.

07:17.534 --> 07:19.200

[all laughing]

07:19.200 --> 07:20.367
- that's funny.
that's good.

07:20.367 --> 07:21.467
Trouble ahead.

07:21.467 --> 07:23.901
- anyway, he fell down
the staircase

07:23.901 --> 07:24.934
On the golf course.

07:24.934 --> 07:26.200
It was their fault.

07:26.200 --> 07:27.634
Some of the stones
were loose.

07:27.634 --> 07:29.701
So we're gonna sue them.
- oh, good for you.

07:29.701 --> 07:31.367
- actually, i'm gonna
meet my lawyer in 20 minutes.

07:31.367 --> 07:32.801
- good.

07:32.801 --> 07:34.033
- hey, why don't you guys
come with me.

07:34.033 --> 07:35.501
'cause it won't take long,

07:35.501 --> 07:37.300
Then we could go out
for lunch afterwards.

07:37.300 --> 07:39.501
We could, you know,
catch up and have some fun.

07:39.501 --> 07:40.801
- i would love that.

07:40.801 --> 07:42.167
That sounds great, sure.
come on.

07:42.167 --> 07:43.834
- natalie,
i have a question.

07:43.834 --> 07:46.100
Does he still eat the same thing
every day for lunch?

07:46.100 --> 07:47.267
- well, wait,
what is it?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.300
- turkey club,
lightly toasted,

07:49.300 --> 07:51.200
Hold the lettuce,
hold the bacon...

07:51.200 --> 07:52.567
[both] hold the mayo.

07:52.567 --> 07:55.300
Five slices of turkey cut four
ways on a square plate.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.300
- oh, my god, half the time
he sticks me with the check.

07:57.300 --> 07:58.734
- oh, my god,
he still does that?

07:58.734 --> 08:01.901
I swear, i don't know
how i survived on $950 a week.

08:01.901 --> 08:02.934
I don't know.

08:15.934 --> 08:18.934
[phone ringing]

08:22.434 --> 08:23.567
- mr. monk.

08:23.567 --> 08:25.534
- yeah, yeah.
i'm almost finished.

08:26.801 --> 08:28.634
You paid her $20 a week
more than me?

08:28.634 --> 08:31.033
- she had a kid!
- i have a kid!

08:31.033 --> 08:32.567
- her kid ate more.

08:32.567 --> 08:34.000
- that's not fair,
and you know it.

08:34.000 --> 08:35.701
- okay, fine,
i'll pay you the same.

08:35.701 --> 08:37.167
On one condition.

08:37.167 --> 08:39.900
When we go to lunch,
don't talk to her.

08:39.900 --> 08:44.534
I mean, you can talk to her,
but not about me.

08:44.534 --> 08:47.501
Don't compare notes.

08:47.501 --> 08:50.534
And sit at separate tables.

08:50.534 --> 08:52.400
And if she offers
to pick up the check,

08:52.400 --> 08:54.868
For god's sake,
don't argue with her.

08:59.434 --> 09:01.634
- ms. fleming, we represent
the eastdale country club.

09:01.634 --> 09:04.501
Now, our client would rather not
drag this through the court

09:04.501 --> 09:06.133
For weeks or years.

09:06.133 --> 09:08.501
We understand
that no amount of money

09:08.501 --> 09:11.000
Could ever
compensate for your loss.

09:11.000 --> 09:14.200
But we're hoping this
will ease at least

09:14.200 --> 09:15.501
Some of your pain.

09:15.501 --> 09:17.501
Think about it.

09:17.501 --> 09:18.834
Take your time.

09:18.834 --> 09:20.200
- we don't have
to think about it.

09:20.200 --> 09:22.067
Whatever your offer is,
it's not enough.

09:22.067 --> 09:24.701
Howard fleming
was in the prime of his life.

09:24.701 --> 09:27.667
Your client knew the stones
on that staircase were loose.

09:27.667 --> 09:30.067
They'd been warned about it
on more than two occasions.

09:30.067 --> 09:32.667
My client didn't come
all this way to be insulted.

09:33.868 --> 09:35.868
- holy jesus palomino.

09:43.601 --> 09:45.267
Uh...

09:45.267 --> 09:46.367
We accept.

09:47.868 --> 09:50.534
No backsies.

10:06.567 --> 10:08.367
- sharona?
- you okay?

10:10.434 --> 10:12.567
- oh, my god.
- what happened?

10:12.567 --> 10:14.434
- i thought at the most
they were gonna offer me

10:14.434 --> 10:17.901
Five to ten grand,
but this is real money.

10:17.901 --> 10:19.868
This will pay
for benjy's college.

10:19.868 --> 10:22.567
Not just community college.
any college.

10:22.567 --> 10:24.267
He can go anywheres
that he wants.

10:24.267 --> 10:26.968
- sharona, that is so great.
i mean, congratulations!

10:26.968 --> 10:28.467
- congratulations.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.934
- i'm sorry circumstance.

10:30.934 --> 10:32.901
- oh, no, no, it's okay.
i only met the guy twice.

10:32.901 --> 10:35.167
Oh, my god.

10:35.167 --> 10:36.868
Is this what good luck
feels like?

10:36.868 --> 10:40.467
I mean, because i never
actually had it, you know?

10:40.467 --> 10:41.834
- huh.

10:41.834 --> 10:43.267
- what?
is there a problem?

10:43.267 --> 10:45.234
- there's something
wrong here.

10:45.234 --> 10:46.367
- don't you say that.

10:46.367 --> 10:47.767
Don't find anything,

10:47.767 --> 10:49.234
Because if this is not
an accident,

10:49.234 --> 10:51.067
Then they're not responsible,

10:51.067 --> 10:52.567
And then they don't
have to pay.

10:52.567 --> 10:53.601
Do you understand?

10:53.601 --> 10:55.968
- right.
okay, right--

10:55.968 --> 10:58.200
- no!

10:58.200 --> 11:01.267
I want you to stop
looking at this.

11:01.267 --> 11:04.367
It was an accident, okay?

11:04.367 --> 11:06.701
- say it was an accident.

11:06.701 --> 11:08.601
No, i want you to say
it was an accident!

11:19.300 --> 11:22.434
- [exhales]

11:22.434 --> 11:24.634
I know that look.

11:24.634 --> 11:25.934
I remember that look.

11:25.934 --> 11:28.968
<i>i hate that look.</i>

11:33.000 --> 11:35.400
[muttering softly]

11:44.834 --> 11:48.234
- mr. monk,
i think they're over there.

11:48.234 --> 11:49.901
- they call him mr. monk, huh?

11:49.901 --> 11:51.367
- i know.
it's weird.

11:51.367 --> 11:52.868
I can't call him
by his first name.

11:52.868 --> 11:54.567
It's just not me.

11:54.567 --> 11:57.901
- adrian, do you mind
if she calls you adrian?

11:57.901 --> 12:00.601
- of course not.
why would i mind?

12:00.601 --> 12:03.901
- okay. adrian.
- yeah, see, i don't like it.

12:03.901 --> 12:06.868
- me either.
- are you serious?

12:06.868 --> 12:08.267
- good. that's it.

12:08.267 --> 12:09.601
All right.

12:09.601 --> 12:13.367
Plant the left foot,
honey.

12:13.367 --> 12:17.367
Focus on the ball.

12:17.367 --> 12:18.534
Thwack!

12:19.934 --> 12:21.467
Well, you looked great.

12:21.467 --> 12:23.534
That's the important thing.

12:23.534 --> 12:26.334
- mr. walsh.

12:26.334 --> 12:28.367
Is this a bad time?

12:28.367 --> 12:30.934
Sir?

12:30.934 --> 12:32.934
- i can't think
of a much worse time.

12:32.934 --> 12:34.934
- i'm sorry to--
thwack!

12:34.934 --> 12:37.000
To bother you.

12:37.000 --> 12:38.567
I'm adrian monk.

12:38.567 --> 12:40.968
- monk.

12:40.968 --> 12:42.968
I know that name.

12:42.968 --> 12:44.067
Oh, yeah,
you're in the news.

12:44.067 --> 12:45.067
The detective.

12:45.067 --> 12:46.234
- that's right.

12:46.234 --> 12:48.968
And this is my assistant
natalie teeger

12:48.968 --> 12:51.000
And sharona fleming,
my other assistant.

12:51.000 --> 12:52.234
My ex-assistant.

12:52.234 --> 12:54.534
My other, former...
- hi.

12:54.534 --> 12:56.968
- my other ex...
- i'm a really big fan.

12:56.968 --> 12:59.234
I saw you four years ago
at brookhaven.

12:59.234 --> 13:00.767
That was heartbreaking.

13:00.767 --> 13:02.667
- that was a rough beat.

13:02.667 --> 13:04.601
And i left the circuit
shortly after.

13:04.601 --> 13:06.334
Took the job here,
married this beautiful woman,

13:06.334 --> 13:07.667
The best decision
of my life.

13:07.667 --> 13:09.667
- i'm carolyn.

13:09.667 --> 13:11.400
- and this is my long-suffering
caddy gary hanks.

13:11.400 --> 13:13.367
- hi.
- hello.

13:13.367 --> 13:14.934
- so you said fleming.

13:14.934 --> 13:16.100
Is this
about howard fleming?

13:16.100 --> 13:18.067
- yeah.
he was my uncle.

13:18.067 --> 13:19.567
- oh.
i'm sorry.

13:19.567 --> 13:20.968
How are you doing?

13:20.968 --> 13:23.434
- she's fine.
i read the police report.

13:23.434 --> 13:24.801
I understand

13:24.801 --> 13:26.868
That you actually saw
the accident?

13:26.868 --> 13:28.000
- yes, sir.

13:28.000 --> 13:29.534
We both did.
- i'll never forget it.

13:29.534 --> 13:31.234
It was on the 12th fairway,
right over there.

13:31.234 --> 13:32.767
- it's all in the report.

13:32.767 --> 13:35.334
It was early.
what, about 7:30 or so?

13:35.334 --> 13:37.234
I had about a 7-iron
into the green.

13:37.234 --> 13:39.000
Pulled a really bad left
and long.

13:39.000 --> 13:40.501
- it was the worst shot
i've ever seen him make.

13:40.501 --> 13:42.567
- so we were behind the green
in the shrubs

13:42.567 --> 13:43.701
Looking for the ball,
and we heard this yelling.

13:43.701 --> 13:44.767
And it was howard.

13:44.767 --> 13:46.567
- [yells]
- i know him slightly.

13:46.567 --> 13:47.868
I'd seen him
around the club.

13:47.868 --> 13:49.400
Gary had a cell phone,

13:49.400 --> 13:50.701
So i told him
to call 911.

13:50.701 --> 13:52.734
- the battery was dead.
piece-of-crap phone.

13:52.734 --> 13:54.734
Thanks for nothing,
fujikawa cellular.

13:54.734 --> 13:57.767
- gary went for help.
i stayed with howard.

13:57.767 --> 13:59.567
I tried cpr.

13:59.567 --> 14:00.968
Tried everything.

14:00.968 --> 14:02.033
By the time the paramedics
had gotten there,

14:02.033 --> 14:04.167
He was gone.

14:04.167 --> 14:07.334
I'm sorry.

14:07.334 --> 14:08.934
- [sighs]

14:08.934 --> 14:10.434
Adrian, you're going
the wrong way.

14:10.434 --> 14:12.234
The car's over there.

14:12.234 --> 14:13.767
- it'll just take a minute.
i want to see the crime scene.

14:13.767 --> 14:15.667
- it's not a crime scene.

14:15.667 --> 14:17.000
Don't call it a crime scene.

14:17.000 --> 14:18.234
- what's wrong?
i don't understand.

14:18.234 --> 14:19.634
They both saw the accident.

14:19.634 --> 14:20.701
It sounded legit to me.

14:20.701 --> 14:22.100
- yeah, me too.

14:22.100 --> 14:23.367
Can't we just say
it's an accident

14:23.367 --> 14:24.400
And get on with our lives?

14:24.400 --> 14:25.901
- get on with our lives.

14:25.901 --> 14:28.434
Sharona, he was your uncle.

14:28.434 --> 14:29.567
- i barely knew him.

14:29.567 --> 14:30.801
I met him twice.

14:30.801 --> 14:32.968
- oh, oh, my god.

14:32.968 --> 14:35.033
It's my--my cuff.
- oh, stop whining.

14:35.033 --> 14:36.734
It's only water.
just shake it off.

14:40.367 --> 14:42.801
- shake it off.

14:42.801 --> 14:44.801
Here.
don't tell her i did this.

15:16.067 --> 15:17.934
- sharona,

15:17.934 --> 15:19.901
Would you lie down
on the ground right here

15:19.901 --> 15:20.968
Where they found
your uncle?

15:20.968 --> 15:22.334
- no.

15:22.334 --> 15:25.767
- natalie, would you?
- no.

15:28.634 --> 15:29.901
- so what do you think?

15:29.901 --> 15:32.968
- i think
i made a mistake.

15:32.968 --> 15:37.133
I mean, look,
the third step

15:37.133 --> 15:40.167
Is very loose.

15:40.167 --> 15:43.868
He obviously slipped
and hit his head.

15:43.868 --> 15:45.634
- so it was an accident!

15:45.634 --> 15:46.801
- yup.

15:46.801 --> 15:48.367
- oh!
- [laughs]

15:48.367 --> 15:49.367
- thank you, god.

15:49.367 --> 15:51.100
Benji is going to college,

15:51.100 --> 15:52.100
And i got to tell him this.

15:52.100 --> 15:53.634
- that's great.
- natalie?

15:53.634 --> 15:55.767
- yes.

15:55.767 --> 15:59.067
- ahem. can i see that?
- sure.

15:59.067 --> 16:01.634
- he didn't fall.
- what?

16:01.634 --> 16:03.133
- shh.

16:03.133 --> 16:05.567
Look at this.
look.

16:05.567 --> 16:08.167
All the golf clubs
are still covered.

16:08.167 --> 16:09.400
There's no golf club
on the ground

16:09.400 --> 16:11.067
Anywhere near the body.

16:11.067 --> 16:12.634
I don't think
he was golfing at all.

16:12.634 --> 16:14.801
And look at this--
he teed off at 7:10.

16:14.801 --> 16:16.334
He died at 7:30.

16:16.334 --> 16:19.133
How did he get
to the 14th green in 20 minutes?

16:19.133 --> 16:21.067
Doesn't make any sense.

16:21.067 --> 16:23.067
- are you sure?

16:23.067 --> 16:24.467
- 72%.

16:24.467 --> 16:26.634
- ah.

16:26.634 --> 16:28.200
You have to tell her.

16:28.200 --> 16:33.667
- i know.

16:33.667 --> 16:37.033
- are you gonna tell her?
- no.

16:38.334 --> 16:40.133
- [knocking on door]
'scuse me, um...

16:40.133 --> 16:42.734
I'd like to lodge a complaint
against one of your officers.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.534
- what did he do?

16:44.534 --> 16:49.133
- he hasn't written
or called me in five years.

16:49.133 --> 16:51.400
- [laughing]

16:51.400 --> 16:52.734
Sharona fleming.

16:52.734 --> 16:53.801
Get in here!

16:53.801 --> 16:56.734
You look fantastic.
- thank you.

16:56.734 --> 16:58.834
- we've got regulations against
public displays of affection,

16:58.834 --> 17:00.801
Which i'm officially waiving.

17:00.801 --> 17:03.200
- it's so good to see you.
- it's good to see you.

17:03.200 --> 17:05.567
- hey, i heard you got
a new girlfriend.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.367
Congratulations.

17:07.367 --> 17:10.000
[gasps] oh, my god!
you won the lottery!

17:10.000 --> 17:12.233
- i feel like i did.

17:12.233 --> 17:14.099
- is she here?

17:14.099 --> 17:16.601
There she is.
she is...here.

17:16.601 --> 17:18.767
Wow, you look great.

17:18.767 --> 17:21.267
- thank you, randy.

17:24.934 --> 17:27.099
It's really good
to see you, randy.

17:27.099 --> 17:29.434
- and...
- and what?

17:29.434 --> 17:31.167
- i don't know, i'm just
waiting for the punch line.

17:31.167 --> 17:34.167
You always used to set me up
and hit me with a zinger.

17:34.167 --> 17:36.767
- what, i did that?
- only all the time.

17:36.767 --> 17:38.300
- oh, my god, was i awful?

17:38.300 --> 17:40.200
- no, you were...

17:40.200 --> 17:44.067
Truth is, i missed it.

17:44.067 --> 17:45.601
Excuse me for
repeating myself,

17:45.601 --> 17:47.434
But you look great!

17:47.434 --> 17:49.767
- hey, randy,
did you pull that rap sheet?

17:49.767 --> 17:51.701
- uh, no, i didn't get
a chance.

17:51.701 --> 17:53.234
- isn't it right there
in your hand?

17:53.234 --> 17:56.200
- oh. yeah.
there it is.

17:56.200 --> 17:58.701
- okay.

17:58.701 --> 17:59.901
This was it.

17:59.901 --> 18:01.634
Yeah. howard fleming.

18:01.634 --> 18:04.067
He's clean, no priors,
no convictions.

18:04.067 --> 18:05.567
- oh, this is about
your uncle.

18:05.567 --> 18:07.334
- yeah.
- yeah, monk told me about that.

18:07.334 --> 18:08.567
That's tough.
i'm sorry.

18:08.567 --> 18:10.434
- yeah.
- what's this, two lawsuits.

18:10.434 --> 18:12.667
1998, a yacht club
in key west,

18:12.667 --> 18:14.300
He slipped
and sprained his neck.

18:14.300 --> 18:17.467
2004, hit by a car.

18:17.467 --> 18:20.467
A mercedes.
settled out of court.

18:20.467 --> 18:23.033
- he was just unlucky.

18:23.033 --> 18:25.567
- a little too unlucky.

18:25.567 --> 18:26.934
- what is that supposed to mean?

18:26.934 --> 18:29.400
- she didn't mean anything.
nobody means anything.

18:29.400 --> 18:30.667
- nobody means anything?
what does that mean?

18:30.667 --> 18:31.868
- doesn't mean anything.

18:31.868 --> 18:33.334
- all i'm saying

18:33.334 --> 18:35.501
Is your uncle howie
seemed to fall down a lot.

18:35.501 --> 18:38.300
- yeah. into some
pretty deep pockets.

18:38.300 --> 18:41.300
- adrian, you were there.
you saw the steps.

18:41.300 --> 18:42.734
You said it was an accident.
it's an accident!

18:42.734 --> 18:44.400
- definitely.
absolutely.

18:44.400 --> 18:46.634
No question about that.
- okay.

18:46.634 --> 18:48.801
- but...

18:48.801 --> 18:50.100
Just to be sure,

18:50.100 --> 18:52.234
Maybe we...

18:52.234 --> 18:55.033
Maybe we should
swing by his apartment

18:55.033 --> 18:56.133
And take a look around.

18:56.133 --> 18:58.434
Just to be...

18:58.434 --> 19:01.133
What?
sure.

19:01.133 --> 19:03.234
- can't hurt.
- no.

19:03.234 --> 19:07.634
- monk...can i talk to you
for a second?

19:13.934 --> 19:15.567
- so...
- yeah.

19:15.567 --> 19:17.367
- you're gonna go
to the uncle's apartment

19:17.367 --> 19:18.901
And check things out.

19:18.901 --> 19:22.801
<i>and you're gonna take natalie
and sharona.</i>

19:22.801 --> 19:26.334
Can i give you a bit of advice
man-to-man?

19:26.334 --> 19:27.834
Big mistake.

19:27.834 --> 19:29.634
- oh, i know.

19:29.634 --> 19:31.267
- monk, you have...

19:31.267 --> 19:34.734
You're barely--you're--

19:34.734 --> 19:37.400
You're very...

19:37.400 --> 19:40.267
You're a fragile person.
- thank you.

19:40.267 --> 19:42.067
- these women
are gonna drive you crazy.

19:42.067 --> 19:44.300
You're gonna have a breakdown.
- oh, i know!

19:44.300 --> 19:46.767
- i love natalie,
and i love sharona too.

19:46.767 --> 19:50.234
They're both wonderful women.
you got lucky twice.

19:50.234 --> 19:53.834
But together...they're like
bourbon and vodka.

19:53.834 --> 19:55.501
I love them both,

19:55.501 --> 19:57.467
But i can't have them
at the same meal,

19:57.467 --> 19:59.801
Because they don't mix.

19:59.801 --> 20:01.834
These women
are so different, monk.

20:01.834 --> 20:04.100
They're gonna tear you apart
like a piece of saltwater taffy.

20:04.100 --> 20:07.601
- i know, i've been a piece
of taffy all day.

20:07.601 --> 20:10.267
Natalie's been acting like
mary, queen of scots.

20:10.267 --> 20:12.267
She wants more money.

20:12.267 --> 20:14.968
I mean, she won't lay down
in the dirt when i ask her.

20:14.968 --> 20:16.434
I'm losing her.

20:16.434 --> 20:18.367
- and it's only gonna
get worse.

20:18.367 --> 20:19.801
- what'll i do?
what...

20:19.801 --> 20:21.667
- well, you're gonna have to
leave one of them here.

20:21.667 --> 20:24.033
- i can't.
i can't choose.

20:24.033 --> 20:26.167
- well...be careful.

20:26.167 --> 20:28.801
- can i call you
if it gets weird?

20:28.801 --> 20:30.901
- no.

20:39.968 --> 20:41.601
- uncle howie
liked the ladies.

20:41.601 --> 20:42.834
- how do you know?

20:42.834 --> 20:45.200
- just trust me.
he liked the ladies.

20:50.567 --> 20:52.567
- this is me.
this is my first communion.

20:52.567 --> 20:55.234
I wonder why he kept it.

20:55.234 --> 20:58.400
- you're family.

20:58.400 --> 21:00.367
- i only met him twice.

21:05.467 --> 21:06.534
- look at this.

21:06.534 --> 21:08.267
- what? what is it?

21:08.267 --> 21:12.167
- i think
your uncle was broke.

21:12.167 --> 21:13.634
- let me see that.

21:13.634 --> 21:14.934
- no, no, no, let me see.
he was my uncle.

21:14.934 --> 21:15.968
<i>he was my uncle.</i>

21:15.968 --> 21:17.334
- okay, okay, okay, okay.

21:17.334 --> 21:21.334
I'll just hold them all up
and you can both see.

21:21.334 --> 21:22.901
I hate this case.

21:22.901 --> 21:24.834
- it's not a case.
it was an accident.

21:24.834 --> 21:26.567
- i hate this accident.

21:32.501 --> 21:33.968
- cushions.

21:33.968 --> 21:36.267
What are those
doing in here?

21:36.267 --> 21:38.901
- my god,
he was practicing.

21:38.901 --> 21:40.934
- practicing what?

21:40.934 --> 21:42.300
- falling.

21:42.300 --> 21:43.767
Sharona, i'm sorry,

21:43.767 --> 21:46.100
But your uncle howie
was a con man.

21:46.100 --> 21:48.200
That's what he was doing
on the golf course.

21:48.200 --> 21:50.400
He was staging an accident,

21:50.400 --> 21:52.167
So he could sue
the country club.

21:52.167 --> 21:53.868
- right, so he was pretending
to fall,

21:53.868 --> 21:55.100
And then he really fell.

21:55.100 --> 21:58.000
- it happens.
i guess con men can trip, too.

21:58.000 --> 21:59.567
- well, i don't believe it.

21:59.567 --> 22:01.267
You're not perfect.
you could be wrong.

22:01.267 --> 22:03.567
- maybe, but i'm not.

22:03.567 --> 22:05.601
- this doesn't mean anything,
cushions on a floor?

22:05.601 --> 22:06.601
You know what i say?

22:06.601 --> 22:08.734
I say that we keep looking.

22:08.734 --> 22:11.033
We go back and we talk
to the golf pro again.

22:11.033 --> 22:12.167
He was a witness.

22:12.167 --> 22:13.968
- no, that won't do any good.

22:13.968 --> 22:15.767
- wait a second, wait a second,
wait a second.

22:15.767 --> 22:18.701
Is this
just about the money?

22:18.701 --> 22:20.767
- yeah, of course,
this is about the money.

22:20.767 --> 22:22.534
Natalie,
if this was a con game,

22:22.534 --> 22:24.801
If he fell on purpose,
i won't see a nickel.

22:24.801 --> 22:26.367
- but it's not like
you lost any money.

22:26.367 --> 22:27.801
You're just back
where you started.

22:27.801 --> 22:29.167
- which is broke!

22:29.167 --> 22:31.033
Which is trying to put my kid
through college!

22:31.033 --> 22:33.000
Not everyone has
zillionaire parents.

22:33.000 --> 22:34.534
- hey, hey, hey,
i've never taken a dime

22:34.534 --> 22:35.534
From my parents.

22:35.534 --> 22:37.667
- well, then give them
my number.

22:42.668 --> 22:44.668
I hate this case.

22:46.501 --> 22:48.234
- oh, yes, i have
all the affidavits.

22:48.234 --> 22:49.534
I'm leaving right now.

22:49.534 --> 22:51.701
I'll meet you downstairs.

22:52.001 --> 22:53.268
- hey.

22:53.268 --> 22:55.901
- oh, hey, uh,
what are you doing here?

22:55.901 --> 22:57.234
- are you busy?

22:57.234 --> 22:58.700
- uh, yeah, actually.

22:58.700 --> 23:00.500
I'm due in court
like ten minutes ago.

23:00.500 --> 23:02.534
- oh.

23:02.534 --> 23:04.901
I just need to talk
to someone,

23:04.901 --> 23:07.700
And i just remember
how good i used to feel

23:07.700 --> 23:09.234
After i talked to you, so...

23:09.234 --> 23:10.700
- really?
- mm-hmm.

23:10.700 --> 23:12.667
- yeah, okay.
walk me downstairs.

23:12.667 --> 23:13.867
What's going on?

23:13.867 --> 23:16.201
- randy, adrian thinks

23:16.201 --> 23:18.201
My uncle's
some kind of scam artist.

23:18.201 --> 23:19.433
We went to his apartment,

23:19.433 --> 23:20.901
And there were
some pillows on the floor,

23:20.901 --> 23:22.967
And adrian thinks
he was practicing how to fall.

23:22.967 --> 23:24.034
- well, that makes sense.

23:24.034 --> 23:25.333
- it does?
- doesn't it?

23:25.333 --> 23:27.300
- that doesn't mean
he's a con artist.

23:27.300 --> 23:29.268
I mean, lost of pe--
- ohh!

23:29.268 --> 23:31.433
- lots of people
practice how to fall.

23:31.433 --> 23:32.867
- why?

23:32.867 --> 23:35.268
- in case they fall.
it's common sense.

23:35.268 --> 23:36.734
- yeah, but, sharona,
you got to admit,

23:36.734 --> 23:38.967
If monk thinks your uncle's
running some kind of a scam,

23:38.967 --> 23:40.767
He's probably running
some kind of scam.

23:40.767 --> 23:44.433
- ohh! randy, adrian is not--
he's not infallible.

23:44.433 --> 23:45.667
He's been wrong before.

23:45.667 --> 23:47.134
Remember the ski instructor?

23:47.134 --> 23:48.433
Adrian said he was the guy,

23:48.433 --> 23:50.067
And it ended up being
his twin brother.

23:50.067 --> 23:51.367
Do you remember that one?

23:51.367 --> 23:52.801
- yeah. no, he was the guy,
remember?

23:52.801 --> 23:54.134
There was no brother.

23:54.134 --> 23:55.400
He was pretending
to be his own twin.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.934
- well, i still don't
believe it.

23:56.934 --> 23:58.801
- well, look, you're talking
about track record,

23:58.801 --> 24:00.500
Why would this be the one case
he screws up?

24:00.500 --> 24:02.101
- 'cause he's
not thinking straight.

24:02.101 --> 24:03.667
Natalie's turned him
against me.

24:03.667 --> 24:04.934
- why would she do that?

24:04.934 --> 24:07.034
- 'cause she's jealous.
adrian likes me better.

24:07.034 --> 24:08.034
- did he say that?

24:08.034 --> 24:09.400
- no, but i can tell.

24:09.400 --> 24:12.867
A woman can tell
who likes who.

24:12.867 --> 24:14.201
- she can?

24:14.201 --> 24:15.801
- absolutely.

24:20.168 --> 24:23.300
- ah, perry walsh, 904.

24:23.300 --> 24:24.734
Where you going?

24:24.734 --> 24:25.801
- ninth floor.

24:25.801 --> 24:27.168
- the elevator's over here.

24:27.168 --> 24:28.467
- mr. monk always
takes the stairs.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.901
- yeah, i know he always takes
the stairs,

24:29.901 --> 24:31.467
But i always made him
take the elevator.

24:31.467 --> 24:32.467
It's good for him.

24:32.467 --> 24:33.700
- thanks, i appreciate it,

24:33.700 --> 24:35.300
But i don't want to make him
uncomfortable.

24:35.300 --> 24:37.168
- but sometimes
he has to be uncomfortable,

24:37.168 --> 24:38.534
Otherwise he'll never learn.

24:38.534 --> 24:40.700
- i'm not his psychiatrist,
i'm his assistant.

24:40.700 --> 24:41.901
- then why don't you try
assisting him,

24:41.901 --> 24:43.433
Instead of pandering
to him?

24:43.433 --> 24:45.300
- how about this?
it's the ninth floor, right?

24:45.300 --> 24:46.867
Let's take the elevator
up to four,

24:46.867 --> 24:48.201
And then walk up
five flights.

24:48.201 --> 24:49.801
- yeah, that sounds fair.

24:49.801 --> 24:51.500
- or we take the elevator
up to level five

24:51.500 --> 24:52.500
And walk up four flights.

24:52.500 --> 24:53.634
- can't argue with that.

24:53.634 --> 24:55.234
- you treat him
like a child.

24:55.234 --> 24:57.168
- he's not a child.
- i did not say he was a child.

24:57.168 --> 24:58.400
I said you're treating
him like a child.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.834
- i'm being supportive.

24:59.834 --> 25:01.700
- you're not being supportive.
you're enabling him.

25:01.700 --> 25:03.634
- here's what we're gonna do.
we're gonna get on the elevator

25:03.634 --> 25:06.400
And take it up to 18
and walk down 9 flights.

25:06.400 --> 25:07.467
[elevator dings]

25:07.467 --> 25:08.934
That way everybody's
miserable.

25:15.034 --> 25:17.201
[knock at door]

25:22.567 --> 25:25.134
- [out of breath] mrs. walsh,
sorry to bother you.

25:25.134 --> 25:26.534
Is this a bad time?

25:26.534 --> 25:28.700
- no, it's fine.
i was just working out.

25:28.700 --> 25:29.801
- [laughs]

25:29.801 --> 25:31.168
- we're here
to see your husband.

25:31.168 --> 25:32.500
- come on in.
he's in the kitchen.

25:32.500 --> 25:34.201
I'll go get him.
- thanks.

25:34.201 --> 25:35.801
- are you okay?

25:35.801 --> 25:37.300
- uh, it was
a long walk.

25:37.300 --> 25:38.834
- is the elevator broken?

25:38.834 --> 25:41.834
[all speaking at once]

25:43.767 --> 25:45.600
- i ill don't know
what we're doing here.

25:45.600 --> 25:47.400
We already talked
to this guy.

25:47.400 --> 25:49.268
- we should talk
to him again.

25:49.268 --> 25:50.700
He was there.
he witnessed the accident.

25:50.700 --> 25:51.834
- it wasn't an accident.

25:51.834 --> 25:53.134
- it was an accident.
- here we go.

25:53.134 --> 25:55.333
- mr. monk?

25:55.333 --> 25:57.600
- ah, you remember sharona
and natalie.

25:57.600 --> 25:58.700
I mean, natalie and sharona.

25:58.700 --> 25:59.700
- hi.

25:59.700 --> 26:02.333
- hi. nice surprise.

26:03.667 --> 26:05.500
Can i get you something
to drink?

26:05.500 --> 26:08.001
- uh, no, thank you.
we're fine.

26:08.001 --> 26:11.101
We have a few more questions
about the incident.

26:11.101 --> 26:13.534
We think that mr. fleming

26:13.534 --> 26:15.801
Might have fallen
on purpose.

26:15.801 --> 26:17.634
- really?

26:17.634 --> 26:19.168
- it's just a theory.

26:19.168 --> 26:21.034
- on that morning,

26:21.034 --> 26:25.101
Did you actually see
mr. fleming play any golf?

26:25.101 --> 26:28.201
- well, now that you
mention it,

26:28.201 --> 26:29.600
No, i don't believe i did.

26:29.600 --> 26:30.934
- yeah, but he fell, right?

26:30.934 --> 26:32.801
I mean, he really fell.

26:32.801 --> 26:34.467
He--he didn't pretend.

26:34.467 --> 26:36.300
- well, i was 50 yards away.

26:36.300 --> 26:37.600
It looked real to me.

26:37.600 --> 26:39.567
I don't know
if he's that good of an actor.

26:39.567 --> 26:41.867
- [fake cough]

26:41.867 --> 26:43.700
[cough]

26:43.700 --> 26:45.767
[cough]

26:45.767 --> 26:48.067
On second thought,
i'd love some water.

26:48.067 --> 26:49.567
- sure.

26:49.567 --> 26:51.034
I'll be right back.

26:53.333 --> 26:56.067
- doesn't mean anything.
- don't say that.

26:56.067 --> 26:58.234
- [whispering]
be cool! just--

26:58.234 --> 27:00.268
Just be cool.

27:00.268 --> 27:02.268
- i'm cool.
- no, you're not.

27:02.268 --> 27:03.433
- look at this.

27:09.467 --> 27:11.168
- his wife is reading
these books:

27:11.168 --> 27:13.767
<i>the passions of erica,
it's a series.</i>

27:13.767 --> 27:17.067
See? volume 1, 2, 3, 5,
6, 7, 8, 9, 10.

27:17.067 --> 27:18.134
Where is volume four?

27:18.134 --> 27:19.333
I'll tell you where it is.

27:19.333 --> 27:21.134
It's in your uncle's
apartment.

27:21.134 --> 27:23.300
I saw it lying open
by the couch.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.767
She left it there.

27:27.534 --> 27:29.101
They're having an affair.

27:29.101 --> 27:30.634
- what?
- uncle howie?

27:30.634 --> 27:32.268
- do you think
that he knows?

27:32.268 --> 27:33.767
- he not only knows.

27:33.767 --> 27:35.201
He did something about it.

27:35.201 --> 27:36.667
[dramatic sigh]

27:36.667 --> 27:37.700
He killed your uncle.

27:37.700 --> 27:39.067
- oh! come on!

27:39.067 --> 27:40.400
- think about it.

27:40.400 --> 27:42.667
Howard was sleeping
with carolyn walsh.

27:42.667 --> 27:46.168
What are the odds of her husband
witnessing his fatal accident?

27:46.168 --> 27:48.433
It's off the charts.
it's virtually impossible.

27:48.433 --> 27:50.801
- but they weren't alone.
the caddy was there.

27:50.801 --> 27:52.268
- yeah, the caddy saw
the whole thing.

27:52.268 --> 27:54.700
- that's the beauty of it.
it was a perfect plan.

27:54.700 --> 27:56.867
- i don't understand.

27:56.867 --> 27:58.300
- i'll tell you later.

27:58.300 --> 27:59.300
- no, no, no, no, no.

27:59.300 --> 28:01.333
- you have to tell me now.

28:01.333 --> 28:02.767
Say "here's what happened."

28:02.767 --> 28:04.400
- well, he's right there.

28:04.400 --> 28:06.333
- just tell me.

28:08.834 --> 28:10.867
Say "here's what happened."

28:10.867 --> 28:12.500
- here's what happened.

28:12.500 --> 28:13.934
Walsh knew his wife
was cheating.

28:13.934 --> 28:16.600
He found a letter
or overheard a phone call.

28:16.600 --> 28:19.534
Somehow, he knew,
but he didn't say anything.

28:19.534 --> 28:21.367
He kept it a secret.

28:21.367 --> 28:23.734
He began planning
his revenge.

28:23.734 --> 28:25.567
- we've got orange juice
if you'd like.

28:25.567 --> 28:27.234
- juice is good.
- fresh squeezed would be good.

28:27.234 --> 28:30.333
- [whispers] keep going.
- no! he's right there!

28:30.333 --> 28:33.534
- okay, get over here.

28:33.534 --> 28:35.300
Here, get in here.
just...get in!

28:35.300 --> 28:36.967
- i'm not getting in there!
- get in!

28:36.967 --> 28:39.134
- okay!

28:39.134 --> 28:40.400
- ow!

28:40.400 --> 28:42.101
- okay, keep going.
- we're in a closet!

28:42.101 --> 28:43.600
I can't do this in a closet.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.034
- yes, you can!
just tell me what happened.

28:45.034 --> 28:47.234
Quickly. come on.

28:47.234 --> 28:55.101
[monk talking in indecipherable
fast-forward voice]

28:55.101 --> 28:57.567
And walsh came running up
and killed him--the end.

28:57.567 --> 28:58.934
Can we go now?
- wait--no!

28:58.934 --> 29:01.101
- i don't understand.
- neither do i.

29:01.101 --> 29:02.801
- just do it again.
just slow down.

29:02.801 --> 29:06.234
- oh, my god.

29:06.234 --> 29:08.934
It was walsh's idea.
he came to your uncle.

29:08.934 --> 29:11.500
He said he had a plan
to rip off the country club.

29:11.500 --> 29:13.067
Howard would pretend
to fall down the stairs.

29:13.067 --> 29:15.734
Walsh would be
the unimpeachable witness.

29:15.734 --> 29:17.901
They'd sue the club
and make a fortune.

29:17.901 --> 29:21.067
Walsh must have known
howard was broke.

29:21.067 --> 29:25.934
He knew he'd take the bait.

29:25.934 --> 29:27.467
Okay. where was i?

29:27.467 --> 29:31.201
- he took the bait.

29:31.201 --> 29:33.300
- that morning,
your uncle was on the green.

29:33.300 --> 29:35.500
He was in position.

29:35.500 --> 29:38.101
Meanwhile, walsh made sure
he and the caddy

29:38.101 --> 29:40.268
Were close enough
to see everything.

29:40.268 --> 29:42.734
Your uncle thought
it was just another scam,

29:42.734 --> 29:44.700
But walsh had other ideas.

29:44.700 --> 29:47.001
Can we at least open the door
just a crack?

29:47.001 --> 29:48.201
- [whispers] keep going.

29:48.201 --> 29:49.834
- the caddy ran off
to get help.

29:49.834 --> 29:52.734
That left walsh alone
with your uncle.

29:54.567 --> 29:56.734
It was a perfect plan,
two witnesses.

29:56.734 --> 29:58.967
Walsh himself and his caddy

29:58.967 --> 30:01.801
Had seen your uncle
fall down those stairs.

30:01.801 --> 30:03.567
Nobody would ever suspect
it was murder--the end.

30:03.567 --> 30:04.934
Can we open the door now?

30:04.934 --> 30:07.500
Hey. we were just
taking a little tour.

30:07.500 --> 30:10.067
Is this oak?

30:10.067 --> 30:13.234
- mr. monk, he knows.
that we know.

30:13.234 --> 30:16.534
- i think we're done here.

30:23.433 --> 30:25.268
- [grunts]
hooh!

30:25.268 --> 30:27.300
- are you...okay?

30:27.300 --> 30:29.400
- i'm waiting
for the screaming to stop.

30:29.400 --> 30:32.867
- there's no screaming.
- the screaming inside my head.

30:32.867 --> 30:35.201
You were in a closet
in his house.

30:35.201 --> 30:37.067
He was standing right there.

30:37.067 --> 30:38.801
He obviously heard everything.

30:38.801 --> 30:40.734
Why didn't you just
leave the apartment?

30:40.734 --> 30:42.901
- i tried!
i told them to be cool.

30:42.901 --> 30:44.734
I actually said, "be cool."

30:44.734 --> 30:47.400
- just step outside the house.
talk in the elevator!

30:47.400 --> 30:49.134
- he doesn't take the elevator.
- ha.

30:49.134 --> 30:52.333
- well, we don't have a case
because you tipped him off.

30:52.333 --> 30:54.333
I just got off the phone
with him.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.300
It's a brick wall.
they're all lawyered up.

30:56.300 --> 30:58.934
- what about his wife?
- she's not talking either.

30:58.934 --> 31:00.734
- that's 'cause he probably
threatened her.

31:00.734 --> 31:03.067
- if this is a homicide,
and i believe you're right,

31:03.067 --> 31:05.700
Because you always are,
we're up against it.

31:05.700 --> 31:10.168
We've got nothing!
we have no physical evidence!

31:10.168 --> 31:12.367
- why you looking at me?
it wasn't my fault.

31:14.834 --> 31:16.934
- what does that mean?
- nothing.

31:16.934 --> 31:19.400
- what, are you blaming me now?
- whoa, wait a minute.

31:19.400 --> 31:21.367
It's not her fault.
i mean, her uncle died.

31:21.367 --> 31:22.534
She's got the right to ask
a couple questions.

31:22.534 --> 31:23.934
- randy, you weren't there.

31:23.934 --> 31:25.967
-neither were you.
- no, i wasn't there!

31:25.967 --> 31:28.967
[all shouting, overlapping]

31:35.567 --> 31:38.234
- monk!
monk, what do you think?

31:41.067 --> 31:42.867
Monk!

31:48.168 --> 31:48.968
Taxi!

31:51.269 --> 31:53.869
You on duty?
Yeah.

31:53.870 --> 31:54.870
Thank you.

31:55.667 --> 32:00.567
- where we going?
- i have $52. How far will that take me?

32:00.568 --> 32:01.568
I don't know. Let's find out.

32:05.867 --> 32:07.934
- okay.

32:07.934 --> 32:09.801
Okay, if we hear anything,
we'll let you know.

32:12.234 --> 32:14.268
- is that the captain?
- randy.

32:14.268 --> 32:16.067
- what did he say?

32:16.067 --> 32:17.967
- no news.

32:17.967 --> 32:20.333
- [exhales]
well, he can't go too far.

32:20.333 --> 32:21.767
He can't sleep without
his trudy pillow.

32:21.767 --> 32:23.901
- or that
special red toothbrush.

32:23.901 --> 32:25.634
- or his little flossing kit.

32:25.634 --> 32:27.834
- or the sound machine

32:27.834 --> 32:29.400
With that fog horn noises.

32:29.400 --> 32:31.234
- actually, that one broke.

32:31.234 --> 32:33.634
And they discontinued
the model.

32:33.634 --> 32:35.634
- really?
what did you do?

32:35.634 --> 32:37.801
- i went out and bought
an actual fog horn

32:37.801 --> 32:39.567
And made my own tape.

32:39.567 --> 32:41.467
- [chuckles]

32:41.467 --> 32:44.268
- [laughs]
i'm not kidding.

32:44.268 --> 32:46.934
I have an actual fog horn
sitting in my garage.

32:46.934 --> 32:49.400
- i do not know
how you put up with him.

32:49.400 --> 32:52.667
I don't know
how i put up with him.

32:52.667 --> 32:55.201
Actually, i do.

32:55.201 --> 32:57.600
I loved him.

32:57.600 --> 32:59.600
I swear, this was
the best job i ever had.

32:59.600 --> 33:01.801
Every day was an adventure.

33:01.801 --> 33:03.801
[breathes deeply]

33:03.801 --> 33:07.567
Funny thing is...
adventures are never fun

33:07.567 --> 33:08.901
When you're having 'em,
you know?

33:10.901 --> 33:14.001
- sharona, i'm sorry.

33:14.001 --> 33:16.001
- oh, no.
no, no, no.

33:16.001 --> 33:17.168
I'm the one
who should be sorry.

33:17.168 --> 33:19.534
I was totally out of line.

33:19.534 --> 33:21.367
You're doing
a really good job with him.

33:21.367 --> 33:23.634
Natalie, you're really
patient with him.

33:23.634 --> 33:25.268
It's more than i ever was.

33:25.268 --> 33:28.201
- no, i'm not.
- yeah, you are.

33:28.201 --> 33:29.801
You're a saint.

33:29.801 --> 33:33.201
- sharona, the reason
why i can be nice to mr. monk

33:33.201 --> 33:34.801
And i can be patient
with him

33:34.801 --> 33:36.300
Is because you did
the hard part.

33:36.300 --> 33:37.700
- nah.

33:37.700 --> 33:38.934
- you wereere
right after trudy

33:38.934 --> 33:41.168
When he couldn't even
get out of bed.

33:41.168 --> 33:43.168
- [exhales]
i don't know.

33:43.168 --> 33:44.834
I think i might've been
too tough on him.

33:44.834 --> 33:46.134
- you needed to be tough.

33:46.134 --> 33:49.834
He was in a bad place.

33:49.834 --> 33:53.534
You got him here.

33:53.534 --> 33:55.967
You got him to me.

34:16.168 --> 34:19.367
- mr. monk.

34:19.367 --> 34:20.833
- you found me.

34:20.833 --> 34:23.067
- have you been here all day?

34:23.067 --> 34:25.699
- i've been here
for 12 years.

34:25.699 --> 34:27.034
- mr. monk, you can
come home now.

34:27.034 --> 34:29.867
We're fine.
- unh.

34:29.867 --> 34:31.034
- hey, i know
you saw us fighting,

34:31.034 --> 34:33.001
I know you got scared,

34:33.001 --> 34:34.367
And we're really
sorry about it.

34:34.367 --> 34:36.134
- yeah, but we talked
about it,

34:36.134 --> 34:39.201
And we decided we really
have to nail this guy walsh.

34:39.201 --> 34:41.168
- absolutely.
i don't care about the lawsuit.

34:41.168 --> 34:43.067
I don't care about that money.
you were right.

34:43.067 --> 34:44.934
Howie fleming was my uncle.

34:44.934 --> 34:46.534
He wasn't perfect,
but he was family,

34:46.534 --> 34:47.934
And we can't let walsh
get away with it.

34:47.934 --> 34:49.801
- so we want to go back
to the country club.

34:49.801 --> 34:51.867
- mm-hmm, i mean, maybe we
overlooked a clue or something.

34:51.867 --> 34:53.567
- what kind of clue?

34:53.567 --> 34:55.168
- we don't know.
that's where you come in.

34:55.168 --> 34:56.734
Come on.
- come on.

34:56.734 --> 35:00.400
Let's go home.
we'll make you dinner.

35:00.400 --> 35:03.168
Is tuesday still
chicken pot pie?

35:03.168 --> 35:04.801
- why, what have you heard?

35:04.801 --> 35:08.001
- of course it is.
i don't even know why i asked.

35:12.433 --> 35:14.667
[sharona grunts]

35:14.667 --> 35:18.201
Even a cancelled card can
come in handy sometimes.

35:18.201 --> 35:19.367
Where do we start?

35:19.367 --> 35:22.201
- where do we start?
right here.

35:25.467 --> 35:27.767
This one's locked.
- wait, hold on.

35:32.234 --> 35:34.101
- where'd you learn that?
- self-taught.

35:38.934 --> 35:42.034
- fujikawa.

35:44.634 --> 35:46.067
- the battery was dead.
piece of crap phone.

35:46.067 --> 35:48.234
Thanks for nothing,
fujikawa cellular.

35:48.234 --> 35:51.134
- it's from the caddy's
cell phone.

35:51.134 --> 35:55.801
Walsh must've
switched batteries.

35:55.801 --> 35:59.467
That morning, walsh put a new
battery in the caddy's phone.

35:59.467 --> 36:02.500
One that wasn't
charged yet.

36:02.500 --> 36:05.634
He had to be sure the caddy
couldn't call for help.

36:05.634 --> 36:06.634
- is that it?
is that proof?

36:06.634 --> 36:08.201
- no.

36:08.201 --> 36:12.067
He could explain this.
but maybe--

36:12.067 --> 36:14.667
- what?
- the caddy's cell phone.

36:14.667 --> 36:17.201
If the new battery
is still inside it,

36:17.201 --> 36:19.567
It would have walsh's
fingerprints all over it.

36:19.567 --> 36:20.901
He'd have a hard time
explaining that.

36:20.901 --> 36:22.734
- my god, we have to find
that caddy.

36:22.734 --> 36:24.168
- hey, mr. walsh,
how you doing?

36:24.168 --> 36:25.700
- oh, my god.
- walsh.

36:25.700 --> 36:29.001
- forget the caddy.
we gotta stop him!

36:47.367 --> 36:49.500
- number three.

36:49.500 --> 36:52.967
And...nice putt!
excellent.

36:52.967 --> 36:54.600
- let's go to 14.

37:00.734 --> 37:04.333
- it's all over walsh.

37:04.333 --> 37:06.534
Oh, god.

37:06.534 --> 37:08.867
