"In order to affect a timely halt
to deteriorating conditions

01:02.321 --> 01:04.949
and to ensure the common good,

01:04.989 --> 01:08.369
a state of emergency is declared
for these territories

01:08.452 --> 01:11.080
by decree of Lord Cutler Beckett,

01:11.163 --> 01:14.291
duly appointed representative
of His Majesty, the king.

01:15.951 --> 01:18.871
By decree, according to martial law,

01:18.954 --> 01:22.416
the following statutes
are temporarily amended:

01:22.499 --> 01:25.169
Right to assembly, suspended.

01:28.005 --> 01:31.091
Right to habeas corpus, suspended.

01:32.676 --> 01:35.762
Right to legal counsel, suspended.

01:36.805 --> 01:41.059
Right to verdict by a jury of peers,
suspended.

01:42.477 --> 01:47.441
By decree, all persons
found guilty of piracy,

01:47.482 --> 01:50.611
or aiding a person convicted of piracy,

01:50.694 --> 01:54.656
or associating with a person
convicted of piracy...

01:55.699 --> 01:59.453
...shall be sentenced to
hang by the neck until dead."

02:31.693 --> 02:35.322
# The king and his men
# The king and his men #

02:35.405 --> 02:40.077
# stole the queen from her bed #

02:41.787 --> 02:47.751
# and bound her in her Bones. #

02:48.794 --> 02:52.047
# The seas be ours #

02:52.381 --> 02:56.468
# and by the powers #

02:58.971 --> 03:04.726
# where we will, we'll roam. #

03:11.900 --> 03:15.070
# Yo, ho, #

03:15.696 --> 03:18.991
# All hands
# haul together, #

03:19.449 --> 03:25.038
# hoist the Colors high. #

03:26.832 --> 03:30.043
# Heave ho, #

03:30.711 --> 03:34.590
# thieves and beggars, #

03:34.673 --> 03:40.679
# never shall we die. #

03:42.389 --> 03:45.851
# Yo, ho, #

03:45.934 --> 03:49.646
# haul together, #

03:49.730 --> 03:51.857
# hoist the Colors high. #

03:51.940 --> 03:53.108
Lord Beckett!

03:54.735 --> 03:57.362
They've started to sing, sir.

03:59.907 --> 04:04.203
- Finally.
- # Thieves and beggars

04:04.703 --> 04:10.542
# never shall we die. #

04:40.989 --> 04:45.160
# Some men have died,
and some are alive #

04:46.119 --> 04:49.540
# Others sail on the sea
# and others sail on the sea #

04:51.124 --> 04:53.544
# with the keys to the cage #

04:53.710 --> 04:55.963
# and the Devil to pay #

04:56.129 --> 05:00.133
# We lay to Fiddler's Green

05:02.219 --> 05:07.140
# The bell has been raised
from its watery grave

05:07.558 --> 05:10.894
# Hear its sepulchral tone

05:12.145 --> 05:17.150
# A call to all
Pay heed the squall
# We are a call to all, pay head the squall #

05:25.576 --> 05:29.037
# Turn your sails to home
# and turn your sail toward home! #

05:31.165 --> 05:33.167
# Yo, ho, #

05:33.876 --> 05:35.878
# haul together, #

05:36.211 --> 05:39.548
# Hoist the colors high

05:41.049 --> 05:43.677
# Heave-ho #

05:43.760 --> 05:45.888
- # Thieve...
- Thief and beggar.

05:45.971 --> 05:49.266
# never say we die. #

05:51.518 --> 05:54.688
A dangerous song to be singing...

05:54.897 --> 05:57.608
...for any who are
ignorant of its meaning.

05:58.233 --> 06:00.110
Particularly a woman.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.031
Particularly a woman alone.

06:04.823 --> 06:07.034
What makes you think
she's alone?

06:11.622 --> 06:13.123
You protect her?

06:14.082 --> 06:16.502
And what makes you think
I need protecting?

06:16.919 --> 06:19.213
Your master's expecting us.

06:19.254 --> 06:23.634
And an unexpected death'd
cast a slight pall on our meeting.

06:25.260 --> 06:26.678
Pick those feet up!

06:28.639 --> 06:30.349
On the double!

06:31.767 --> 06:33.560
Eyes front!

06:42.444 --> 06:44.071
No, no, no. None.

07:12.182 --> 07:14.893
It always takes me
about a week to get my sea legs.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.104
I was throwing up horribly
the last time.

07:28.490 --> 07:31.535
Steady as she goes.

07:33.912 --> 07:34.913
All right.

07:38.625 --> 07:40.502
Have you heard anything from Will?

07:40.586 --> 07:42.921
I trust young Turner
to acquire the charts

07:43.005 --> 07:46.425
and you to remember your place
in the presence of Captain Sao Feng.

07:46.967 --> 07:49.011
Is he that terrifying?

07:49.094 --> 07:54.016
He's much like myself, but absent my
merciful nature and sense of fair play.

08:09.031 --> 08:11.658
We're through. Make ready.

08:18.165 --> 08:19.333
Hurry now.

08:25.756 --> 08:29.635
Do you think because she is a woman
we would not suspect her of treachery?

08:31.970 --> 08:34.014
Well, when you put it that way...

08:34.681 --> 08:36.475
Remove. Please.

09:21.311 --> 09:24.356
Remove. Please.

10:09.610 --> 10:13.864
Captain Barbossa,
welcome to Singapore.

10:18.452 --> 10:19.578
More steam.

10:42.142 --> 10:43.101
None of that.

10:43.185 --> 10:47.147
If things don't go the way we want,
then we're the only chance they've got.

10:53.445 --> 10:58.033
I understand that you have
a request to make of me.

10:58.116 --> 11:01.161
More of a proposal to put to ye.

11:01.578 --> 11:07.000
I've a venture underway and I find
myself in need of a ship and a crew.

11:08.043 --> 11:11.839
Hmm. It's an odd coincidence.

11:11.880 --> 11:15.008
Because you happen to have
a ship and a crew you don't need?

11:15.050 --> 11:17.469
No.

11:17.553 --> 11:20.180
Because earlier this day,
not far from here,

11:20.222 --> 11:24.184
a thief broke into
my most revered uncle's temple

11:24.351 --> 11:27.354
and tried to make off with these.

11:29.022 --> 11:31.692
The navigational charts.

11:32.359 --> 11:36.071
The route to the Farthest Gate.

11:38.574 --> 11:43.036
Wouldn't it be amazing
if this venture of yours

11:43.120 --> 11:46.540
took you to the world beyond this one?

11:46.582 --> 11:49.459
It would strain credulity at that.

12:03.515 --> 12:08.228
This is the thief.
Is his face familiar to you?

12:11.023 --> 12:14.443
Then I guess he has
no further need for it.

12:14.776 --> 12:15.777
No, no!

12:24.703 --> 12:29.625
You come into my city
and you betray my hospitality.

12:30.501 --> 12:33.962
- I assure you I had no idea...
- That he would get caught!

12:38.383 --> 12:41.553
You intend to attempt the voyage
to Davy Jones' Locker.

12:41.637 --> 12:43.931
But I cannot help but wonder...

12:45.641 --> 12:46.975
Why?

12:56.443 --> 13:02.157
The song has been sung.
The time is upon us.

13:02.699 --> 13:06.453
We must convene the Brethren Court.

13:06.495 --> 13:12.459
As one of the nine pirate lords,
you must honor the call.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.504
More steam.

13:22.511 --> 13:24.012
More steam!

13:31.144 --> 13:34.648
- There is a price on all our heads.
- Aye.

13:34.690 --> 13:36.608
It is true.

13:36.692 --> 13:39.945
It seems the only way a pirate
can turn a profit anymore...

13:41.572 --> 13:44.992
...is by betraying other pirates.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.411
We must put
our differences aside.

13:47.494 --> 13:48.537
Wait for the signal.

13:48.620 --> 13:51.790
The First Brethren Court
gave us rule of the seas.

13:51.874 --> 13:56.503
But now that rule is being challenged
by Lord Cutler Beckett.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.381
Against East India
Trading Company,

13:59.464 --> 14:02.134
what value is the Brethren Court?

14:02.801 --> 14:04.636
What can any of us do?

14:04.720 --> 14:07.556
You can fight!
Get off me!

14:07.598 --> 14:11.059
You are Sao Feng,
the pirate lord of Singapore.

14:11.143 --> 14:15.856
You command in an age of piracy
where bold captains sail free waters.

14:16.356 --> 14:19.776
Where waves aren't measured in feet,
but as increments of fear,

14:19.860 --> 14:22.112
and those who pass the test
become legend.

14:22.779 --> 14:25.532
Would you have that era
come to an end on your watch?

14:26.074 --> 14:28.744
The most notorious pirates
from around the world

14:28.827 --> 14:30.829
are uniting against our enemy,

14:30.913 --> 14:33.999
and yet you sit here
cowering in your bathwater!

14:39.421 --> 14:41.340
Elizabeth Swann.
Elizabeth Swann

14:41.882 --> 14:45.552
There is more to you
than meets the eye, isn't there?

14:46.345 --> 14:50.307
And the eye does not go wanting.

14:51.850 --> 14:57.231
But I cannot help but notice
you have failed to answer my question.

14:58.565 --> 15:01.944
What is it you seek
in Davy Jones' Locker?

15:02.027 --> 15:03.237
Jack Sparrow.

15:06.281 --> 15:08.325
He's one of the pirate lords.

15:14.206 --> 15:15.707
The only reason...

15:16.708 --> 15:20.754
...I would want Jack Sparrow returned
from the land of the dead...

15:21.463 --> 15:24.800
...is so I can send him back myself!

15:29.263 --> 15:33.475
Jack Sparrow holds
one of the nine pieces of eight.

15:33.559 --> 15:37.020
He failed to pass it along
to a successor before he died.

15:37.104 --> 15:39.731
So we must go and get him back.

15:44.945 --> 15:48.282
So you admit...

15:48.615 --> 15:50.868
...you have deceived me.

15:50.951 --> 15:52.327
Weapons!

15:55.539 --> 15:56.748
Weapons.

15:57.416 --> 16:01.420
Sao Feng, I assure you,
our intentions are strictly honorable.

16:08.510 --> 16:11.430
Drop your weapons or I kill the man!

16:13.891 --> 16:15.642
Kill him. He's not our man.

16:17.728 --> 16:20.647
If he's not with you,
and he's not with us...

16:21.315 --> 16:23.192
...who's he with?

16:23.275 --> 16:25.694
Charge!

16:46.548 --> 16:47.508
Will!
Will!

17:01.897 --> 17:04.441
Look out! Look behind you!

17:07.402 --> 17:08.694
Ready!

17:10.280 --> 17:11.240
Fire.

17:21.083 --> 17:22.041
Chart!

17:47.734 --> 17:48.735
Boo!

17:53.115 --> 17:57.744
Company! Make ready. Set. Fire!

18:04.710 --> 18:05.711
Company!

18:05.794 --> 18:07.880
Make ready. Set.

18:10.841 --> 18:13.010
Fire!

18:28.817 --> 18:31.278
It's an odd coincidence, isn't it?

18:31.320 --> 18:36.283
The East India Trading Company finds me
the day you show up in Singapore.

18:36.325 --> 18:37.784
It is coincidence only.

18:41.497 --> 18:45.375
If you want to make a deal with Beckett,
you need what I offer.

18:46.627 --> 18:51.089
You cross Barbossa.
You are willing to cross Jack Sparrow.

18:51.548 --> 18:54.218
Why should I expect any better?

18:54.301 --> 18:57.179
I need the Black Pearl
to free my father.

19:00.432 --> 19:02.059
You're helping me to get it.

19:11.193 --> 19:12.653
Uh-oh.

19:17.991 --> 19:19.451
Fire in the hole.

19:37.636 --> 19:38.846
Thank you, Jack.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.014
Thank you, Jack.

19:43.225 --> 19:46.019
- You have the charts?
- And better yet.

19:46.687 --> 19:49.439
- A ship and a crew.
- Where's Sao Feng?

19:49.523 --> 19:52.359
He'll cover our escape
and meet us at Shipwreck Cove.

19:52.401 --> 19:54.236
This way. Be quick.

20:00.576 --> 20:03.287
Haul the snotters with a will!

20:03.370 --> 20:05.080
Keep it taut.

20:06.123 --> 20:09.126
Secure provisions
and stow the cargo.

20:09.209 --> 20:12.045
There's no place left
for Sao Feng to cower.

20:12.629 --> 20:15.007
Do you think he will honor the call?

20:15.591 --> 20:17.551
I cannot say.

20:18.427 --> 20:20.679
There's an evil on these seas

20:20.762 --> 20:26.059
that even the most staunch and
bloodthirsty pirates have come to fear.

21:33.210 --> 21:34.670
A piece of eight.

21:35.379 --> 21:37.130
Nine of them, you say.

21:37.172 --> 21:40.300
Our new friend in Singapore
was very specific, sir.

21:40.342 --> 21:41.969
Nine pieces of eight.

21:42.010 --> 21:44.596
What's the significance of that,
I wonder.

21:44.680 --> 21:47.015
Nothing can hold against the armada.

21:47.057 --> 21:49.309
Not with the Flying Dutchman
at the lead.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.894
Nothing we know of.

21:52.271 --> 21:55.607
Did your friend mention
where the Brethren Court are meeting?

21:55.691 --> 21:58.402
He was mum on that, sir.

21:58.485 --> 21:59.945
Hmm.

22:00.028 --> 22:02.447
Then he knows the value of information.

22:02.489 --> 22:05.325
Better keep this between ourselves.

22:05.367 --> 22:08.662
We don't want anyone
running off to Singapore, do we?

22:10.581 --> 22:15.294
- Ah, admiral.
- You summoned me, Lord Beckett.

22:15.377 --> 22:18.088
Yes. Something for you there.

22:18.172 --> 22:21.550
Your new station deserves an old friend.

22:35.314 --> 22:38.650
- Not more requisition orders.
- No, sir.

22:38.734 --> 22:40.277
Execution.

22:46.158 --> 22:48.368
The Brethren know they face extinction.

22:49.369 --> 22:53.749
All that remains is for them to decide
where they make their final stand.

23:18.524 --> 23:21.735
No one said anything about cold.

23:21.777 --> 23:25.572
I'm sure there must be
a good reason for our suffering.

23:26.573 --> 23:29.493
Why don't that obeah woman
bring Jack back the same way

23:29.576 --> 23:34.081
- she brought back Barbossa?
- Because Barbossa was only dead.

23:35.415 --> 23:39.670
Jack Sparrow is taken, body and soul,

23:39.753 --> 23:44.925
to a place not of death, but punishment.

23:44.967 --> 23:48.804
The worst fate a person
can bring upon himself...

23:49.263 --> 23:51.473
...stretching on forever.

23:51.932 --> 23:55.435
That's what awaits
at Davy Jones' Locker.

23:59.606 --> 24:02.985
Yeah. I knew there was a good reason.

24:13.954 --> 24:16.206
Nothing here is set.

24:17.416 --> 24:19.585
These can't be
as accurate as modern charts.

24:19.668 --> 24:24.339
No. But it leads to more places.

24:30.387 --> 24:31.930
"Over the edge.

24:32.014 --> 24:34.433
Over again."

24:36.268 --> 24:38.979
"Sunrise sets.

24:39.021 --> 24:42.024
Flash of green."

24:42.900 --> 24:46.904
Do you care to interpret,
Captain Barbossa?

24:47.696 --> 24:52.576
Ever gazed upon the green flash,
Master Gibbs?

24:52.659 --> 24:57.206
I reckon I seen my fair share.
Happens on rare occasion.

24:57.289 --> 25:01.084
The last glimpse of sunset,
a green flash shoots up into the sky.

25:01.502 --> 25:04.505
Some go their whole lives
without ever seeing it.

25:04.546 --> 25:07.382
Some claim to have seen it who ain't.
And some say...

25:07.466 --> 25:11.637
It signals when a soul
comes back to this world from the dead.

25:16.225 --> 25:19.811
- Sorry.
- Trust me, young Master Turner.

25:19.895 --> 25:23.190
It's not getting to the land
of the dead that's the problem.

25:25.442 --> 25:27.194
It's getting back.

26:07.860 --> 26:12.447
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!
Bosun!
Head to wind! Lift the sail!

26:12.531 --> 26:13.740
Aye, aye, sir!

26:15.909 --> 26:19.037
Bloody hell. There's nothing left.

26:19.121 --> 26:22.457
Jones is a loose cannon, sir.

26:22.958 --> 26:24.918
Fetch the chest.

26:25.627 --> 26:27.754
And the governor?

26:28.547 --> 26:32.301
He's been asking questions
about the heart.

26:32.885 --> 26:34.720
Does he know?

26:38.307 --> 26:41.935
Then perhaps his usefulness
has run its course.

27:42.204 --> 27:44.206
Step lively, men.

27:44.665 --> 27:46.208
Step lively!

27:48.293 --> 27:49.503
Stand fast!

27:56.218 --> 27:57.886
Steady, men.

28:03.684 --> 28:09.565
Go. All of you.
And take that infernal thing with you.

28:09.606 --> 28:12.568
I will not have it on my ship!

28:12.651 --> 28:16.196
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that...
because I will.

28:16.238 --> 28:19.158
Because it seems to be
the only way to ensure

28:19.199 --> 28:22.619
that this ship do as directed
by the company.

28:27.833 --> 28:30.252
We need prisoners to interrogate,

28:30.335 --> 28:33.547
which tends to work best
when they're alive.

28:33.630 --> 28:37.509
The Dutchman sails
as its captain commands.

28:37.593 --> 28:41.471
And its captain
is to sail it as commanded.

28:44.099 --> 28:48.187
I would have thought you'd learned that
when I ordered you to kill your pet.

28:49.146 --> 28:52.858
This is no longer your world, Jones.

28:53.692 --> 28:57.070
The immaterial has become...

28:58.197 --> 28:59.948
...immaterial.

29:01.033 --> 29:03.118
Charge your bayonets.

29:42.115 --> 29:44.493
How long do we continue not talking?

29:48.497 --> 29:51.041
Once we rescue Jack,
everything'll be fine.

29:54.169 --> 29:55.587
Then we rescue Jack.

30:20.863 --> 30:24.074
For what we want most...

30:26.076 --> 30:29.371
...there is a cost
must be paid in the end.

30:40.674 --> 30:45.596
- Barbossa, ahead!
- Aye, we're good and lost now.

30:46.513 --> 30:49.141
- Lost?
- For certain you have to be lost

30:49.224 --> 30:51.185
to find a place as can't be found.

30:51.268 --> 30:53.645
Elseways, everyone
would know where it was.

30:53.896 --> 30:56.398
- We're gaining speed.
- Aye.

30:57.399 --> 30:58.984
To stations!

31:00.110 --> 31:01.486
All hands to stations!

31:01.570 --> 31:04.323
Huh?

31:04.406 --> 31:07.284
Rudder full. Hard aport! Gather way.

31:07.367 --> 31:12.206
Nay! Belay that!
Let her run straight and true!

31:14.082 --> 31:15.334
Blimey.

31:29.348 --> 31:32.726
- You've doomed us all.
- Don't be so unkind.

31:32.768 --> 31:35.437
You may not survive
to pass this way again,

31:35.521 --> 31:39.358
and these be the last
friendly words you'll hear.

31:44.112 --> 31:45.364
Tie her off.

31:51.036 --> 31:52.746
Hard aport.

32:01.463 --> 32:03.507
Hold on!

32:35.455 --> 32:40.085
Strike your colors,
you blooming cockroaches.

32:40.169 --> 32:45.674
Dead men tell no tales.

33:33.889 --> 33:35.307
My peanut.

33:36.892 --> 33:38.977
Haul the halyard. Slacken braces.

33:39.061 --> 33:41.355
Aye, captain.
Slacken braces.

33:41.396 --> 33:43.524
Step lively with a will.

33:43.607 --> 33:45.192
- Aye, aye.
- Right away, sir.

33:45.275 --> 33:46.985
I want a fire down below!

33:50.072 --> 33:53.826
- Help.
- Man the yards, you filthy toads.

34:04.795 --> 34:08.590
Haul! Haul!

34:08.674 --> 34:11.552
Haul the sheets handsomely.
Scandalize the lateens.

34:11.592 --> 34:13.428
- Aye, sir.
- Right away, sir.

34:27.442 --> 34:29.402
- Mr. Sparrow?
- Aye, cap'n.

34:30.154 --> 34:32.906
What say you about
the condition of this tack line?

34:33.614 --> 34:37.034
- It be proper to my eyes, sir.
- Proper?

34:37.119 --> 34:40.956
It is neither proper nor suitable, sir.
It is not acceptable nor adequate.

34:41.039 --> 34:43.458
It is, in obvious fact, an abomination.

34:43.542 --> 34:47.087
Begging your pardon, sir,
but if you gave a man another chance.

34:47.462 --> 34:49.422
Shall I?

34:53.385 --> 34:56.429
It's that sort of thinking
got us into this mess.

34:59.183 --> 35:02.060
We have lost speed and, therefore, time.

35:02.144 --> 35:06.356
Precious time,
which cannot be recovered once lost.

35:06.440 --> 35:08.233
Do you understand?

35:08.317 --> 35:11.445
- Aye, aye, captain.
- Do you now?

35:11.987 --> 35:15.157
It will all have to be redone.
All of it.

35:15.240 --> 35:17.701
And let this serve
as a lesson to the lot of you.

35:17.784 --> 35:21.288
Doldrums, sir,
has the entire crew on edge.

35:21.330 --> 35:24.333
I have no sympathy
for any of you feculent maggots,

35:24.374 --> 35:27.294
and no more patience
to pretend otherwise.

35:30.088 --> 35:34.092
Gentlemen, I wash my hands
of this weirdness.

35:44.645 --> 35:46.021
No wind.

35:46.522 --> 35:48.524
Of course, there's no bloody wind.

35:50.150 --> 35:52.611
My soul I do swear for a breeze.

35:52.694 --> 35:57.491
Gust. Whisper. A tiny, miniature lick.

36:10.295 --> 36:12.798
Yes, sir, I know, but why?
Why would he do that?

36:12.840 --> 36:14.550
Because he's a lummox, isn't he?

36:14.633 --> 36:18.345
We shall have a magnificent
garden party and you're not invited.

36:31.567 --> 36:33.026
Shoo.

36:52.045 --> 36:53.297
A rock.

37:20.616 --> 37:24.161
Now we're being followed by rocks.
Never had that before.

37:24.453 --> 37:25.454
Oh.

37:26.955 --> 37:28.499
A rope.

39:49.223 --> 39:52.309
This truly is a godforsaken place.

39:53.060 --> 39:56.146
I don't see Jack.
I don't see anyone.

39:57.481 --> 39:59.107
He's here.

39:59.191 --> 40:02.486
Davy Jones never once
gave up that what he took.

40:02.569 --> 40:03.987
And does it matter?

40:04.071 --> 40:07.115
We're trapped here by your doing.
No different than Jack.

40:10.285 --> 40:15.457
Witty Jack is closer than you think.

40:56.081 --> 40:57.624
Impossible.

41:03.297 --> 41:04.298
Boat.

41:10.679 --> 41:14.558
Slap me thrice
and hand me to me mama. It's Jack.

41:23.692 --> 41:26.403
- It's the captain!
- A sight for sore eyes.

41:26.487 --> 41:27.571
Hide the rum.

41:27.654 --> 41:29.573
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Aye, cap'n.

41:29.656 --> 41:30.991
I thought so.

41:31.074 --> 41:34.036
I expect you're able
to account for your actions, then.

41:34.119 --> 41:35.120
Sir?

41:35.204 --> 41:39.208
There's been a perpetual and virulent
lack of discipline upon my vessel. Why?

41:39.291 --> 41:41.627
- Why is that, sir?
- Sir, you're...

41:42.461 --> 41:45.255
You're in Davy Jones' Locker, cap'n.

41:48.967 --> 41:52.262
I know that.
I know where I am.

41:52.346 --> 41:56.558
- And don't think I don't.
- Jack Sparrow.
- Jack Sparrow

41:57.267 --> 41:59.144
Oh, Hector.

41:59.228 --> 42:01.146
It's been too long. Hasn't it?

42:01.230 --> 42:06.026
Aye. Isla de Muerta, remember?
You shot me.

42:07.402 --> 42:09.279
No, I didn't.

42:09.363 --> 42:11.448
Tia Dalma, out and about, eh?

42:11.532 --> 42:15.410
You add an agreeable sense
of the macabre to any delirium.

42:16.745 --> 42:18.664
He thinks we're a hallucination.

42:19.540 --> 42:21.250
William, tell me something:

42:21.291 --> 42:25.337
Have you come because you need my help
to save a certain distressing damsel,

42:25.420 --> 42:28.966
or rather, damsel in distress?
Either one.

42:29.508 --> 42:30.509
No.

42:30.592 --> 42:33.011
Well, then,
you wouldn't be here, would you?

42:33.095 --> 42:37.057
So you can't be here.
Q.E.D., you're not really here.

42:37.140 --> 42:38.517
Jack.
Jack

42:40.686 --> 42:42.604
This is real. We're here.

42:53.615 --> 42:56.243
- The Locker, you say?
- Aye.

42:56.702 --> 42:58.996
We've come to rescue you.

43:00.622 --> 43:04.126
Have you, now?
That's very kind of you.

43:04.209 --> 43:07.546
But it would seem that
as I possess a ship and you don't,

43:07.671 --> 43:11.758
you're the ones in need of rescuing,
and I'm not sure as I'm in the mood.

43:12.634 --> 43:16.138
I see my ship. Right there.

43:19.641 --> 43:21.185
Can't spot it.

43:21.268 --> 43:24.605
Must be a tiny little thing
hiding somewhere behind the Pearl.

43:24.646 --> 43:27.441
Jack, Cutler Beckett
has the heart of Davy Jones.

43:27.524 --> 43:30.903
- He controls the Flying Dutchman.
- He's taking over the seas.

43:30.986 --> 43:33.822
The song has been sung.
The Brethren Court is called.

43:33.906 --> 43:37.701
Leave you alone for a minute, look
what happens. Everything's gone to pot.

43:37.784 --> 43:40.454
Aye. The world
needs you back something fierce.

43:40.496 --> 43:42.331
And you need a crew.

43:44.416 --> 43:46.627
Why should I sail with any of you?

43:46.668 --> 43:50.172
Four of you have tried to kill me
in the past. One of you succeeded.

43:53.926 --> 43:57.346
Oh, she's not told you.

43:57.429 --> 44:00.265
You'll have loads to talk about
while you're here.

44:01.642 --> 44:03.101
As for you...

44:04.353 --> 44:10.192
Now... don't tell me
you didn't enjoy it at the time.

44:11.193 --> 44:13.237
Fair enough. All right, you're in.

44:13.320 --> 44:15.239
Don't need you. You scare me.

44:15.322 --> 44:19.159
Gibbs, you can come. Marty. Mm...

44:19.243 --> 44:20.911
- Cotton.
Cotton

44:20.994 --> 44:25.499
Cotton's parrot, I'm a little iffy, but
at least I'll have someone to talk to.

44:26.708 --> 44:28.001
Who are you?

44:28.043 --> 44:30.379
Tai Huang. These are my men.

44:31.046 --> 44:34.842
- Where do your allegiances lie?
- With the highest bidder.

44:35.300 --> 44:38.971
- I have a ship.
- That makes you the highest bidder.

44:39.054 --> 44:43.058
Good man. Weigh anchor, all hands.
Prepare to make sail.

44:43.141 --> 44:44.309
Weigh anchor.

44:47.896 --> 44:49.481
Jack...
Jack...

44:50.858 --> 44:54.444
Which way are you going, Jack?

44:56.572 --> 44:59.908
Trim that sail.
Slack windward brace and sheet.

44:59.950 --> 45:02.536
- Haul the pennant line.
- Haul the pennant line.

45:02.578 --> 45:04.037
What are you doing?

45:04.121 --> 45:06.707
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

45:06.748 --> 45:09.543
- What are you doing?
- No, what are you doing?

45:09.585 --> 45:12.087
What are you?
Captain gives orders on the ship.

45:12.171 --> 45:14.339
The captain of the ship
is giving orders.

45:14.923 --> 45:17.885
- My ship, makes me captain.
- They be my charts.

45:17.968 --> 45:20.470
That makes you "chartman."

45:20.554 --> 45:25.434
Stow it! The both of you!
That's an order! Understand?!

45:31.273 --> 45:34.485
Sorry. I just thought
with the captain issue in doubt,

45:34.568 --> 45:37.488
I'd throw in my name for consideration.

45:37.571 --> 45:38.822
Sorry.

45:43.577 --> 45:45.871
- I'd vote for you.
- Yeah?

46:21.281 --> 46:23.158
You left Jack to the Kraken.

46:24.201 --> 46:26.328
He's rescued now. It's done with.

46:29.498 --> 46:31.500
Will, I had no choice.

46:32.709 --> 46:34.586
You chose not to tell me.

46:35.504 --> 46:37.256
I couldn't.

46:38.590 --> 46:40.175
It wasn't your burden to bear.

46:41.176 --> 46:43.053
But I did bear it, didn't I?

46:44.763 --> 46:46.640
I just didn't know what it was.

46:47.432 --> 46:49.059
I thought...

46:50.227 --> 46:52.229
You thought I loved him.

47:00.737 --> 47:04.575
If you make your choices alone,
how can I trust you?

47:07.578 --> 47:08.871
You can't.

47:37.441 --> 47:38.609
Eerie.

47:40.360 --> 47:42.529
That's downright macabre.

47:48.076 --> 47:51.747
I wonder what would happen if you
dropped a cannonball on one of them?

48:01.673 --> 48:03.884
Be disrespectful, it would.

48:03.926 --> 48:07.721
They should be
in the care of Davy Jones.

48:09.348 --> 48:12.518
That was the duty
him was charged with...

48:12.809 --> 48:15.521
...by the goddess, Calypso.

48:17.397 --> 48:21.193
To ferry those who die at sea
to the other side.

48:24.488 --> 48:26.448
And every ten years...

48:27.241 --> 48:29.409
...him could come ashore...

48:30.410 --> 48:34.748
...to be with she
who love him... truly.

48:39.086 --> 48:41.672
But the man has become a monster.

48:42.297 --> 48:46.301
So he wasn't always... tentacley?

48:48.428 --> 48:49.596
No.

48:51.807 --> 48:54.184
Him was a man...

48:54.268 --> 48:56.270
...once.

49:03.569 --> 49:05.571
Now there's boats coming.

49:13.287 --> 49:16.039
They're not a threat to us. Am I right?

49:16.665 --> 49:19.251
We are nothing but ghosts to them.

49:19.334 --> 49:21.587
It's best just let them be.

49:36.059 --> 49:38.520
It's my father. We've made it back.

49:38.604 --> 49:41.148
Father! Father, here, look here!

49:42.983 --> 49:44.067
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth

49:46.028 --> 49:47.529
We're not back.

49:54.661 --> 49:55.662
Father!

49:58.957 --> 50:02.461
Elizabeth. Are you dead?

50:03.670 --> 50:05.047
No. No.

50:06.048 --> 50:07.716
I think I am.

50:07.799 --> 50:09.801
No, you can't be.

50:10.928 --> 50:13.805
There was this chest, you see.

50:14.556 --> 50:18.227
It's odd.
At the time it seemed so important.

50:18.894 --> 50:20.145
Come aboard.

50:20.229 --> 50:21.980
And a heart.

50:22.064 --> 50:27.319
I learned that if you stab the heart,
yours must take its place.

50:27.361 --> 50:30.906
And you will sail the seas for eternity.

50:30.989 --> 50:33.992
The Dutchman must have a captain.

50:35.077 --> 50:37.037
Silly thing to die for.

50:37.412 --> 50:40.666
Someone, cast a line.
Come back with us!

50:42.501 --> 50:43.585
Come on.

50:44.670 --> 50:48.882
A touch... of destiny.

50:51.760 --> 50:53.053
Take the line.

50:55.597 --> 50:57.766
I'm so proud of you, Elizabeth.

50:57.850 --> 50:59.560
Father, the line! Take the line!

51:03.397 --> 51:05.732
- She must not leave the ship!
- Father!

51:05.774 --> 51:10.070
Please come with us!
Please! No! I won't leave you!

51:10.696 --> 51:12.698
I'll give your love to your mother.

51:12.739 --> 51:15.617
- Please, I won't let you go!
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth

51:15.701 --> 51:17.744
- Elizabeth.
Elizabeth

51:23.876 --> 51:25.127
Is there a way?

51:29.965 --> 51:31.633
Him at peace.

51:39.057 --> 51:40.601
No water.

51:41.768 --> 51:43.854
Why is all but the rum gone?

51:45.481 --> 51:46.940
Rum's gone too.

51:55.115 --> 51:59.745
If we cannot escape
these doldrums before night,

51:59.828 --> 52:03.707
I fear we will sail on trackless seas.

52:03.790 --> 52:07.002
Doomed to roam the reach between worlds.

52:07.836 --> 52:08.921
Forever.

52:09.004 --> 52:12.966
With no water, forever
looks to be arriving a mite too soon.

52:13.509 --> 52:15.260
Why doesn't he do something?

52:15.677 --> 52:18.514
- Me eye. Give it back!
- There's no sense to it.

52:18.597 --> 52:22.935
And the green flash
happens at sunset, not sunrise.

52:23.310 --> 52:27.940
"Over the edge." Ah, it's
driving me over the blooming edge.

52:28.607 --> 52:30.567
Sunrises don't set.

52:35.072 --> 52:36.990
"Up is down."

52:37.032 --> 52:39.535
Well, that's just maddeningly unhelpful.

52:39.618 --> 52:41.578
Why are these things never clear?

52:41.662 --> 52:44.498
- Clear as mud, Jackie.
- What? Eh?

52:48.168 --> 52:50.671
- Stab the heart.
- Don't stab the heart.

52:50.712 --> 52:53.882
- Come again?
- The Dutchman must have a captain.

52:53.966 --> 52:56.510
That's even more
than less than unhelpful.

52:56.552 --> 52:59.346
Sail the seas for eternity.

52:59.388 --> 53:02.349
- I love the sea.
- What about port?

53:02.391 --> 53:04.393
I prefer rum. Rum's good.

53:04.476 --> 53:09.481
Making port. Where we can get rum,
and salty wenches...

53:09.898 --> 53:13.485
- Once every 10 years.
- What'd he say?

53:13.569 --> 53:17.030
- Once every 10 years.
- Ten years is a long time, mate.

53:17.072 --> 53:19.408
Even longer given the deficit of rum.

53:19.491 --> 53:21.743
But eternity is longer still.

53:22.494 --> 53:25.539
And how will you be spending it? Dead?

53:26.206 --> 53:27.583
Or not?

53:27.666 --> 53:31.545
- The immortal Captain Sparrow.
- Oh, I like that.

53:31.837 --> 53:34.173
Come sunset, it won't matter.

53:36.967 --> 53:38.677
Not sunset.

53:41.930 --> 53:43.140
Sundown.

53:44.099 --> 53:46.643
And rise. Up.

53:47.936 --> 53:49.104
What's that?

53:51.940 --> 53:55.068
What is that?
I don't know. What do you think?

53:55.110 --> 53:56.820
- Where?
- There.

54:18.634 --> 54:19.968
What is it?

54:31.980 --> 54:33.816
He's rocking the ship.

54:34.149 --> 54:35.776
We're rocking the ship.

54:39.905 --> 54:42.783
Aye. He's onto it.

54:45.077 --> 54:46.787
He's rocking the ship.

54:46.870 --> 54:49.289
We'll tie each other
to the mast upside down,

54:49.331 --> 54:52.000
so when the boat flips
we'll be the right way up.

54:53.126 --> 54:54.628
Time it with the swell.

54:56.296 --> 54:59.967
Loose the cannons, you lazy bilge rats.

55:01.718 --> 55:05.347
Unstow the cargo. Let it shift.

56:10.329 --> 56:11.705
Now up...

56:13.248 --> 56:14.583
...is down.

57:50.596 --> 57:52.598
This was your idea.

57:54.141 --> 57:56.643
Blessed sweet westerlies!

57:57.811 --> 57:58.770
We're back!

58:02.608 --> 58:03.901
It's the sunrise.

58:17.039 --> 58:19.041
Parley?

58:19.124 --> 58:21.585
We need our pistols!
Get untied, hurry!

58:37.059 --> 58:38.435
All right, then!

58:38.519 --> 58:41.647
The Brethren Court
is a-gathering at Shipwreck Cove.

58:41.730 --> 58:45.400
And, Jack, you and I are a-going.
There'll be no arguing that point.

58:45.484 --> 58:46.860
I is arguing the point.

58:46.944 --> 58:50.572
If there's pirates a-gathering,
I'm pointing my ship the other way.

58:50.656 --> 58:54.076
The pirates are gathering
to fight Beckett, and you're a pirate.

58:54.159 --> 58:56.453
Fight or not,
you're not running, Jack.

58:56.537 --> 58:59.540
If we don't stand together,
they'll hunt us down one by one,

58:59.623 --> 59:01.250
till there be none left but you.

59:02.167 --> 59:07.631
Quite like the sound of that.
Captain Jack Sparrow, the last pirate.

59:07.714 --> 59:08.715
Aye.

59:09.258 --> 59:13.595
And you'll be fighting Jones alone.
How does that figure into your plan?

59:13.679 --> 59:15.681
I'm still working on that.

59:15.764 --> 59:20.227
But I will not be going back
to the Locker, mate. Count on that.

59:25.899 --> 59:27.234
Wet powder.

59:29.987 --> 59:33.532
Wait! We can still use them as clubs!

59:35.534 --> 59:38.078
- Ow!
- Sorry. Effective, though.

59:39.163 --> 59:41.206
There's fresh water on this island.

59:41.290 --> 59:44.918
We can resupply there and get back
to shooting each other later.

59:45.210 --> 59:48.005
You lead the shore party.
I'll stay with my ship.

59:48.463 --> 59:50.924
I'll not be leaving
my ship in your command.

59:50.966 --> 59:54.595
Why don't you both go ashore
and leave the ship in my command.

59:55.846 --> 59:57.181
Temporarily.

01:00:14.990 --> 01:00:16.575
Mind the boat.

01:00:27.628 --> 01:00:30.506
- Criminy.
- Odds bodkins!

01:00:49.525 --> 01:00:51.527
Careful! Careful!

01:00:53.070 --> 01:00:54.988
You stupid fish!

01:00:55.113 --> 01:00:57.074
Actually it's a cephalopod.

01:00:57.533 --> 01:00:58.742
Serves you right.

01:00:58.867 --> 01:01:01.870
Pin, I bet people
would pay a shilling to see this.

01:01:01.954 --> 01:01:05.123
And another shilling
for a sketch of them sitting atop!

01:01:05.207 --> 01:01:08.210
Pintel and Ragetti, Kraken slayers.

01:01:08.293 --> 01:01:11.129
We could serve up
a slice as a souvenir.

01:01:11.171 --> 01:01:13.799
Still thinking of running, Jack?

01:01:14.550 --> 01:01:17.052
Think you can outrun the world?

01:01:22.724 --> 01:01:26.562
You know, the problem
with being the last of anything...

01:01:26.645 --> 01:01:29.356
...by and by, there be none left at all.

01:01:30.732 --> 01:01:35.737
Sometimes things come back, mate.
We're living proof, you and me.

01:01:35.821 --> 01:01:38.949
Aye, but that's a gamble
of long odds, ain't it?

01:01:39.658 --> 01:01:42.327
There's never
a guarantee of coming back.

01:01:42.828 --> 01:01:45.497
But passing on, that's dead certain.

01:01:48.876 --> 01:01:51.879
Summoning the Brethren Court,
then, is it?

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.672
It's our only hope, lad.

01:01:55.090 --> 01:01:58.051
That's a sad commentary
in and of itself.

01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:02.389
The world used to be a bigger place.

01:02:05.058 --> 01:02:06.935
The world's still the same.

01:02:08.896 --> 01:02:11.648
There's just... less in it.

01:02:33.921 --> 01:02:36.298
Poisoned. Fouled by the body.

01:02:39.092 --> 01:02:42.888
Eh, I know him. He was in Singapore!

01:02:42.930 --> 01:02:44.932
- Singapore.
- Captain!

01:02:47.810 --> 01:02:48.894
Hoy!

01:02:49.978 --> 01:02:51.772
We got company!

01:03:03.242 --> 01:03:04.910
He's the captain.

01:03:15.379 --> 01:03:16.672
Sao Feng...

01:03:16.755 --> 01:03:21.260
...you showing up here,
it is truly a remarkable coincidence.

01:03:24.054 --> 01:03:25.681
Jack Sparrow.
Jack Sparrow

01:03:27.641 --> 01:03:29.768
You paid me great insult once.

01:03:29.810 --> 01:03:31.311
That doesn't sound like me.

01:03:36.233 --> 01:03:38.402
Shall we just call it square, then?

01:03:38.944 --> 01:03:40.112
Release her.

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:44.741
- She's not part of the bargain.
- And what bargain be that?

01:03:45.617 --> 01:03:47.619
You heard Captain Turner.

01:03:49.163 --> 01:03:51.748
- Release her!
- "Captain Turner"?

01:03:51.832 --> 01:03:54.585
Aye, the perfidious rotter
led a mutiny against us!

01:03:54.668 --> 01:03:57.212
I need the Pearl to free my father.

01:03:57.296 --> 01:03:59.798
That's the only reason
I came on this voyage.

01:04:00.340 --> 01:04:03.177
Why didn't you tell me
you were planning this?

01:04:03.218 --> 01:04:05.429
It was my burden to bear.

01:04:07.681 --> 01:04:11.977
He needs the Pearl.
Captain Turner needs the Pearl.

01:04:12.060 --> 01:04:16.106
And you felt guilty.
And you and your Brethren Court.

01:04:17.149 --> 01:04:20.068
Did no one come to save me
just because they missed me?

01:04:29.286 --> 01:04:30.746
I'm standing with them.

01:04:32.915 --> 01:04:38.587
I'm sorry, Jack, but there is an
old friend who wants to see you first.

01:04:38.670 --> 01:04:42.299
I'm not certain I can survive
any more visits from old friends.

01:04:44.718 --> 01:04:46.929
Here is your chance to find out.

01:04:56.355 --> 01:04:58.023
Curious.

01:04:58.106 --> 01:05:01.235
Your friends appear
to be quite desperate, Jack.

01:05:01.318 --> 01:05:05.864
Perhaps they no longer believe that
a gathering of squabbling pirates

01:05:05.948 --> 01:05:07.908
can defeat the Flying Dutchman.

01:05:08.617 --> 01:05:12.079
And so despair leads to betrayal.

01:05:12.454 --> 01:05:16.458
But you and I are no strangers
to betrayal, are we?

01:05:19.253 --> 01:05:20.712
It's not here, Jack.

01:05:22.130 --> 01:05:23.549
What? What isn't?

01:05:23.590 --> 01:05:28.095
The heart of Davy Jones.
It's safely aboard the Dutchman,

01:05:28.178 --> 01:05:31.223
and so unavailable for use as leverage

01:05:31.306 --> 01:05:33.934
to satisfy your debt
to the good captain.

01:05:34.017 --> 01:05:37.271
By my reckoning,
that account has been settled.

01:05:37.437 --> 01:05:39.481
By your death?

01:05:39.565 --> 01:05:41.608
And yet here you are.

01:05:42.151 --> 01:05:44.778
Close your eyes
and pretend it's all a bad dream.

01:05:44.862 --> 01:05:46.280
That's how I get by.

01:05:47.197 --> 01:05:50.826
And if Davy Jones
were to learn of your survival?

01:05:51.451 --> 01:05:52.911
Ship oars.

01:05:52.995 --> 01:05:54.538
Ship oars.

01:05:54.830 --> 01:05:56.456
Be on your guard, men.

01:05:59.084 --> 01:06:00.961
My men are crew enough.

01:06:01.003 --> 01:06:03.172
Company ship, company crew.

01:06:04.256 --> 01:06:07.176
You agreed.
The Black Pearl was to be mine.

01:06:08.051 --> 01:06:09.469
And so it was.

01:06:12.514 --> 01:06:15.601
Perhaps you'll consider
an alternative arrangement.

01:06:15.684 --> 01:06:20.898
One which requires absolutely
nothing from you but information.

01:06:27.321 --> 01:06:32.034
Regarding the Brethren Court, no doubt.
In exchange for fair compensation?

01:06:33.118 --> 01:06:35.162
Square my debt with Jones...

01:06:36.205 --> 01:06:38.081
...guarantee my freedom?

01:06:38.165 --> 01:06:39.791
Of course.

01:06:39.875 --> 01:06:41.793
It's just good business.

01:06:42.878 --> 01:06:47.674
Were I in a divulgatory mood,
what then might I divulge?

01:06:47.716 --> 01:06:49.927
Everything.

01:06:50.385 --> 01:06:51.720
Where are they meeting?

01:06:52.513 --> 01:06:54.473
Who are the pirate lords?

01:06:55.474 --> 01:06:58.685
What is the purpose
of the nine pieces of eight?

01:06:59.311 --> 01:07:02.439
Prepare the brig.

01:07:05.108 --> 01:07:10.030
Beckett agreed the Black Pearl
was to be mine.

01:07:10.072 --> 01:07:13.742
He's not going to give up the only ship
as can outrun the Dutchman, is he?

01:07:20.916 --> 01:07:25.254
Shame they're not bound to honor
the code of the Brethren, isn't it?

01:07:25.337 --> 01:07:28.590
Because honor's
a hard thing to come by nowadays.

01:07:29.258 --> 01:07:32.427
There is no honor
to remaining with the losing side.

01:07:32.511 --> 01:07:37.057
Leaving it for the winning side,
that's just good business.

01:07:37.099 --> 01:07:40.978
- The losing side, you say?
- They have the Dutchman.

01:07:41.061 --> 01:07:42.521
Now the Pearl!

01:07:43.564 --> 01:07:45.482
And what do the Brethren have?

01:07:46.191 --> 01:07:49.236
We have Calypso.

01:07:57.035 --> 01:07:59.413
Calypso.

01:08:01.456 --> 01:08:03.458
An old legend.

01:08:04.626 --> 01:08:09.548
No. The goddess herself,
bound in human form.

01:08:09.965 --> 01:08:15.262
Imagine all the power of the seas
brought to bear against our enemy.

01:08:15.304 --> 01:08:20.600
I intend to release her.
But for that I need the Brethren Court.

01:08:22.978 --> 01:08:24.563
All the Court.

01:08:26.439 --> 01:08:28.149
You can keep Barbossa.

01:08:28.233 --> 01:08:32.279
The belligerent homunculus and
his friend with the wooden eye, both.

01:08:32.362 --> 01:08:34.907
And Turner. Especially Turner.

01:08:34.990 --> 01:08:38.410
The rest go with me on the Pearl.
I'll lead you to Shipwreck Cove,

01:08:38.493 --> 01:08:42.831
where I will hand you the pirates
and you will not hand me to Jones.

01:08:42.915 --> 01:08:47.461
- Bloody fair deal, don't you think?
- And what becomes of Miss Swann?

01:08:50.171 --> 01:08:52.299
What interest is she to you?

01:08:54.843 --> 01:08:57.220
What are you proposing, captain?

01:08:57.304 --> 01:09:00.307
What be accepting, cap'n?

01:09:01.767 --> 01:09:04.144
- The girl.
- What?

01:09:04.185 --> 01:09:05.770
Jack.
Jack

01:09:06.438 --> 01:09:08.232
I've just recalled.

01:09:08.314 --> 01:09:13.319
I've got this wonderful compass,
which points to whatever I want.

01:09:13.821 --> 01:09:16.113
So for what do I need you?

01:09:16.198 --> 01:09:18.200
Elizabeth is not part of any bargain.

01:09:19.033 --> 01:09:20.368
Out of the question.

01:09:20.410 --> 01:09:22.203
It was not a question.

01:09:22.287 --> 01:09:24.038
Points to the thing you want most.

01:09:24.122 --> 01:09:26.332
And that is not
the Brethren Court, is it?

01:09:26.375 --> 01:09:29.627
- Then what is, Jack?
- Me.

01:09:30.546 --> 01:09:32.714
- Dead.
- Done.

01:09:32.798 --> 01:09:35.466
What? Not done.

01:09:35.551 --> 01:09:38.095
You got us into this.
If it frees us, then done!

01:09:38.178 --> 01:09:39.263
Damn.

01:09:43.475 --> 01:09:47.229
Although, if I kill you,
then I can use the compass

01:09:47.312 --> 01:09:51.817
to find Shipwreck Cove,
is it, on my own.

01:09:52.151 --> 01:09:54.528
Cut out the middle man, as it were.

01:09:54.570 --> 01:09:56.321
Elizabeth, they are pirates.

01:09:56.405 --> 01:09:59.867
I have had more than enough
experience dealing with pirates!

01:10:00.492 --> 01:10:02.870
Then we have an accord?

01:10:04.746 --> 01:10:07.291
With me killed,
you'd arrive at the cove,

01:10:07.374 --> 01:10:10.544
find it a stronghold,
nigh impregnable...

01:10:10.627 --> 01:10:13.589
...able to withstand blockade for years.

01:10:13.630 --> 01:10:18.218
Then you'd be wishing,"If only there
was someone I had not killed inside

01:10:18.343 --> 01:10:21.763
to ensure that the pirates
then come outside."

01:10:22.639 --> 01:10:24.558
And you can accomplish all this?

01:10:25.851 --> 01:10:28.896
You may kill me,
but you may never insult me.

01:10:29.229 --> 01:10:30.314
Who am I?

01:10:32.608 --> 01:10:34.318
I'm Captain Jack Sparrow.

01:10:38.155 --> 01:10:39.323
Done!

01:11:12.606 --> 01:11:13.774
Man overboard!

01:11:27.830 --> 01:11:29.039
You're mad.

01:11:29.331 --> 01:11:32.584
Thank goodness.
If I wasn't, this'd probably never work.

01:11:50.269 --> 01:11:53.438
And that was without
even a single drop of rum.

01:12:00.946 --> 01:12:05.701
Send this pestilent, traitorous,
cowhearted, yeasty codpiece to the brig.

01:12:07.953 --> 01:12:09.621
Which ship do we follow?

01:12:09.705 --> 01:12:14.334
Signal the Dutchman to track down
Sao Feng. We follow the Pearl.

01:12:15.335 --> 01:12:17.838
How soon can we have
the ship ready to pursue?

01:12:20.716 --> 01:12:22.050
She's going down!

01:12:22.092 --> 01:12:23.635
Stand clear!

01:12:27.723 --> 01:12:32.644
Do you think he plans it all out,
or just makes it up as he goes along?

01:12:34.521 --> 01:12:35.481
Sir.

01:13:17.940 --> 01:13:23.904
By this time tomorrow, we will arrive
at Shipwreck Cove and you will be free.

01:13:26.448 --> 01:13:27.866
Calypso.

01:13:28.951 --> 01:13:30.410
Excuse me?

01:13:31.453 --> 01:13:35.541
Not a name you fancy, I imagine,
out of the many that you have...

01:13:36.124 --> 01:13:37.751
...but it is what we call you.

01:13:39.670 --> 01:13:40.879
We being who?

01:13:45.592 --> 01:13:47.427
You confirm it.

01:13:48.762 --> 01:13:50.180
Confirm what?

01:13:51.431 --> 01:13:56.061
- You've told me nothing.
- The Brethren Court, not I.

01:13:56.145 --> 01:14:00.732
The First Brethren Court,
whose decision I would have opposed.

01:14:01.817 --> 01:14:03.735
They bound you to human form

01:14:03.819 --> 01:14:07.281
so the rule of the seas
would belong to man and not...

01:14:07.322 --> 01:14:09.116
To me.

01:14:11.660 --> 01:14:16.540
But one such as you should never
be anything less than what you are.

01:14:16.623 --> 01:14:19.209
Pretty speech from a captor.

01:14:19.293 --> 01:14:23.255
But words whispered
through prison bars lose their charm.

01:14:23.630 --> 01:14:26.592
Can I be blamed for my efforts?

01:14:28.594 --> 01:14:32.848
All men are drawn to the sea,
perilous though it may be.

01:14:32.931 --> 01:14:36.727
And some men offer desire
as justification for their crimes.

01:14:37.769 --> 01:14:40.272
I offer simply my desire.

01:14:41.773 --> 01:14:43.275
And in return?

01:14:44.359 --> 01:14:48.322
I would have your gifts,
should you choose to give them.

01:14:52.367 --> 01:14:56.371
And if I should choose not?

01:14:57.873 --> 01:14:59.875
Then I will take...

01:15:01.210 --> 01:15:02.211
...your fury.

01:15:28.028 --> 01:15:29.321
Sao Feng?

01:15:30.906 --> 01:15:31.990
Here.

01:15:32.407 --> 01:15:33.909
Please.

01:15:39.748 --> 01:15:43.293
With all nine pieces of eight...

01:15:45.754 --> 01:15:47.840
...you will be free.

01:15:49.675 --> 01:15:50.801
Take it!

01:15:52.636 --> 01:15:54.471
You are captain now.

01:15:55.639 --> 01:15:56.682
Me?

01:15:59.309 --> 01:16:03.897
Go in my place to Shipwreck Cove.

01:16:05.983 --> 01:16:08.569
Captain! The ship is taken.
We cannot...

01:16:10.028 --> 01:16:13.574
Forgive me... Calypso.

01:16:22.833 --> 01:16:23.917
Sao.

01:16:29.047 --> 01:16:30.757
What did he tell you?

01:16:35.804 --> 01:16:37.681
He made me captain.

01:16:39.975 --> 01:16:42.186
Set! Fire!

01:16:47.649 --> 01:16:49.651
You are not my captain.

01:16:49.943 --> 01:16:51.278
Elizabeth.
Elizabeth

01:16:52.112 --> 01:16:53.697
James. James.
James James

01:16:58.452 --> 01:17:00.412
Thank God, you're alive.

01:17:01.121 --> 01:17:02.664
Your father'll be overjoyed

01:17:02.748 --> 01:17:05.584
- to know you're safe.
- My father's dead.

01:17:06.043 --> 01:17:08.795
No, that can't be true.
He returned to England.

01:17:09.796 --> 01:17:11.715
Did Lord Beckett tell you that?

01:17:13.008 --> 01:17:15.803
Who among you
do you name as captain?

01:17:15.844 --> 01:17:17.346
Captain. Her.

01:17:17.429 --> 01:17:19.097
Her.

01:17:21.975 --> 01:17:23.060
Captain?

01:17:23.143 --> 01:17:26.814
Tow the ship.
Put the prisoners in the brig.

01:17:28.106 --> 01:17:30.067
The captain shall have my quarters.

01:17:31.652 --> 01:17:33.111
Thank you, sir.

01:17:33.195 --> 01:17:36.907
- But I prefer to remain with my crew.
- Elizabeth.
- Elizabeth

01:17:36.990 --> 01:17:38.450
I swear.

01:17:39.409 --> 01:17:40.452
I did not know.

01:17:40.536 --> 01:17:44.665
Know what?
Which side you chose?

01:17:52.714 --> 01:17:54.466
Well, now you do.

01:18:03.142 --> 01:18:04.143
Bootstrap?

01:18:12.734 --> 01:18:14.069
Bootstrap.

01:18:14.570 --> 01:18:15.779
Bill Turner?
Bill Turner?

01:18:16.905 --> 01:18:18.031
Bootstrap.

01:18:27.249 --> 01:18:29.126
You know my name.

01:18:32.629 --> 01:18:34.006
Yes, I know your son.

01:18:36.049 --> 01:18:37.593
Will Turner.
Will Turner

01:18:39.052 --> 01:18:40.137
William.
William

01:18:46.018 --> 01:18:48.520
He made it. He's alive.

01:18:48.562 --> 01:18:52.816
And now he sends you to tell me
that he's coming to get me.

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:57.154
God's wounds. He's on his way.

01:18:57.237 --> 01:18:58.572
Yes, Will is alive.

01:19:00.032 --> 01:19:01.575
And he wants to help you.

01:19:07.080 --> 01:19:10.709
He can't help me. He won't come.

01:19:11.460 --> 01:19:13.045
But you're his father.

01:19:13.879 --> 01:19:15.631
I know you.

01:19:16.465 --> 01:19:18.050
He spoke of you.

01:19:20.010 --> 01:19:23.180
He can't save me.
He can't come because of you.

01:19:24.556 --> 01:19:25.599
Me?

01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.852
You're Elizabeth.

01:19:30.229 --> 01:19:31.688
Yes, I'm Elizabeth.

01:19:33.482 --> 01:19:38.445
If Jones be slain,
he who slays him must take his place.

01:19:39.029 --> 01:19:41.907
Captain... Forever.

01:19:44.785 --> 01:19:47.746
The Dutchman
must always have a captain.

01:19:48.455 --> 01:19:50.541
And if he saves me...

01:19:51.750 --> 01:19:53.627
...he loses you.

01:19:56.588 --> 01:19:57.673
I see.

01:19:59.675 --> 01:20:01.510
He won't pick me.

01:20:02.469 --> 01:20:04.638
I wouldn't pick me.

01:20:09.685 --> 01:20:11.228
Tell him not to come.

01:20:13.438 --> 01:20:15.566
Tell him to stay away.

01:20:16.859 --> 01:20:18.902
Tell him it's too late.

01:20:20.487 --> 01:20:22.739
I'm already a part of the ship...

01:20:24.825 --> 01:20:26.451
...and the crew.

01:20:28.620 --> 01:20:29.621
Bootstrap.

01:20:32.708 --> 01:20:34.585
You know my name.

01:20:35.502 --> 01:20:37.588
You know my name.

01:20:38.839 --> 01:20:40.674
Yes, I know your son.

01:20:41.675 --> 01:20:43.343
William.
William

01:20:45.971 --> 01:20:47.931
He's coming for me.

01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:50.142
Wait and see.

01:20:51.226 --> 01:20:52.561
You'll see.

01:20:53.979 --> 01:20:55.731
He promised.

01:21:12.164 --> 01:21:14.082
Swing her over.

01:21:15.292 --> 01:21:17.044
Ready those lines.

01:21:28.806 --> 01:21:29.973
Sir.

01:21:33.352 --> 01:21:35.229
A breadcrumb trail.

01:21:35.270 --> 01:21:39.608
- And we're meant to follow.
- A betrayer among them?

01:21:39.691 --> 01:21:44.863
- Or a trap?
- A gambit by a skilled opponent.

01:21:46.156 --> 01:21:50.160
- Adjust course, lieutenant.
- Sir?

01:21:51.995 --> 01:21:54.248
We can only hope
to reach our destination

01:21:54.331 --> 01:21:56.375
before they run out of bodies.

01:22:10.013 --> 01:22:13.100
You escaped the brig
even quicker than I expected.

01:22:14.017 --> 01:22:17.437
William, do you notice anything?

01:22:19.106 --> 01:22:20.315
Rather...

01:22:20.732 --> 01:22:24.278
...do you notice something
that is not there to be noticed?

01:22:25.028 --> 01:22:28.031
- You haven't raised an alarm.
- Odd, isn't it?

01:22:28.115 --> 01:22:29.575
Not as odd as this.

01:22:30.951 --> 01:22:33.453
Come up with this
all by your lonesome, did you?

01:22:33.495 --> 01:22:36.540
I said to myself,"Think like Jack."

01:22:36.915 --> 01:22:39.126
This is what you've arrived at?

01:22:39.168 --> 01:22:42.504
Lead Beckett to Shipwreck Cove
so as to gain his trust...

01:22:42.588 --> 01:22:44.423
...accomplish your own ends?

01:22:44.506 --> 01:22:46.300
It's like you don't know me at all.

01:22:49.595 --> 01:22:52.681
And how does your dearly beloved
feel about this plan?

01:22:54.057 --> 01:22:55.392
Ah.

01:22:56.018 --> 01:22:58.520
You've not seen fit
to trust her with it.

01:23:01.899 --> 01:23:03.442
I'm losing her, Jack.

01:23:04.193 --> 01:23:08.155
Every step I make for my father
is a step away from Elizabeth.

01:23:08.614 --> 01:23:12.326
If you choose to lock your heart away,
you'll lose her for certain.

01:23:12.868 --> 01:23:16.038
If I might lend a machete
to your intellectual thicket...

01:23:17.206 --> 01:23:19.208
...avoid the choice altogether.

01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.502
Change the facts.

01:23:22.544 --> 01:23:25.547
Let someone else dispatch Jones.

01:23:26.340 --> 01:23:27.674
Who?

01:23:31.929 --> 01:23:32.930
You?

01:23:35.265 --> 01:23:38.685
Death has a curious way
of reshuffling one's priorities.

01:23:38.727 --> 01:23:42.272
I slip aboard the Dutchman,
find the heart, stab the beating thing,

01:23:42.356 --> 01:23:44.107
your father's free from his debt,

01:23:44.191 --> 01:23:46.902
you're free to be
with your charming murderess.

01:23:46.985 --> 01:23:50.823
You're willing to cut out your heart
and bind yourself to the Dutchman...

01:23:50.906 --> 01:23:54.868
...forever?
- No, mate. I'm free forever.

01:23:54.910 --> 01:23:58.956
Free to sail the seas beyond the edges
of the map. Free from death itself.

01:23:59.289 --> 01:24:01.333
You have to do the job though, Jack.

01:24:01.416 --> 01:24:04.503
You have to ferry souls
to the next world.

01:24:05.128 --> 01:24:07.714
Or end up just like Jones.

01:24:09.800 --> 01:24:11.802
I don't have the face for tentacles.

01:24:13.637 --> 01:24:16.181
But immortal has to
count for something, eh?

01:24:20.227 --> 01:24:21.395
What's this for?

01:24:21.436 --> 01:24:24.148
Think like me. It'll come to you.

01:24:37.411 --> 01:24:39.788
My regards to Davy Jones.

01:24:45.085 --> 01:24:46.545
I hate him.

01:24:51.091 --> 01:24:52.259
Come with me.

01:24:55.804 --> 01:24:57.055
Quickly.

01:25:06.106 --> 01:25:07.357
What are you doing?

01:25:09.026 --> 01:25:11.069
Choosing a side.

01:25:35.594 --> 01:25:39.556
Do not go to Shipwreck Cove. Beckett
knows of the meeting of the Brethren.

01:25:39.640 --> 01:25:41.975
I fear there may be
a traitor among them.

01:25:43.310 --> 01:25:45.437
It's too late to earn my forgiveness.

01:25:46.688 --> 01:25:49.483
I had nothing to do
with your father's death.

01:25:51.652 --> 01:25:54.655
But that does not absolve me
of my other sins.

01:25:58.200 --> 01:25:59.284
Come with us.

01:26:03.330 --> 01:26:05.040
James, come with me.

01:26:06.250 --> 01:26:08.168
Who goes there?

01:26:10.921 --> 01:26:12.840
Go. I will follow.

01:26:14.466 --> 01:26:16.135
You're lying.

01:26:18.887 --> 01:26:21.765
Our destinies have been entwined,
Elizabeth...

01:26:24.143 --> 01:26:25.644
...but never joined.

01:26:32.192 --> 01:26:33.861
Go, now.

01:26:39.867 --> 01:26:42.035
Back to your station, sailor.

01:26:43.871 --> 01:26:49.126
- No one leaves the ship.
- Stand down. That's an order.

01:26:49.209 --> 01:26:50.878
That's an order.

01:26:51.962 --> 01:26:54.631
Part of the crew, part of the ship.

01:26:54.715 --> 01:26:57.468
Part of the crew,
part of the ship. Part of the crew...

01:26:57.551 --> 01:27:00.429
- Steady, man.
- Part of the crew, part of the ship.

01:27:00.512 --> 01:27:02.890
All hands, prisoner escape!

01:27:03.265 --> 01:27:05.476
- Belay that!
- James!
- James!

01:27:17.237 --> 01:27:19.323
Prisoner escape!

01:27:21.742 --> 01:27:23.410
James! No!

01:27:32.503 --> 01:27:35.297
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead?

01:27:35.380 --> 01:27:37.382
- The admiral's dead.
- Admiral's dead.

01:27:40.636 --> 01:27:43.180
- To the captain's cabin!
- Aye!

01:27:43.263 --> 01:27:45.224
Back to the ship.

01:27:47.226 --> 01:27:51.146
James Norrington. Do you fear death?

01:28:00.489 --> 01:28:02.574
I take that as a "no."

01:28:07.079 --> 01:28:08.580
Nice sword.

01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:34.606
The Dutchman is under my command.

01:28:37.109 --> 01:28:39.403
For now.

01:28:55.169 --> 01:28:57.254
Look alive and keep a weather eye.

01:28:57.337 --> 01:28:59.715
Not for naught
it's called Shipwreck Island.

01:28:59.798 --> 01:29:03.218
Where lies Shipwreck Cove
and the town of Shipwreck.

01:29:03.302 --> 01:29:05.721
You heard him. Step lively.

01:29:05.804 --> 01:29:08.140
For all that pirates are clever clogs,

01:29:08.182 --> 01:29:11.018
we are unimaginative
when it comes to naming things.

01:29:11.101 --> 01:29:12.311
Aye.

01:29:12.394 --> 01:29:16.523
I once sailed with a geezer who lost
both of his arms and part of his eye.

01:29:16.607 --> 01:29:18.192
What'd you call him?

01:29:19.359 --> 01:29:20.611
Larry.

01:29:24.323 --> 01:29:27.284
I do not renege
on a bargain once struck.

01:29:27.367 --> 01:29:29.328
But we agreed on ends only.

01:29:29.411 --> 01:29:32.372
The means are mine to decide.

01:29:32.456 --> 01:29:34.958
Caution, Barbossa.

01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.254
Do not forget it was by my power
you return from the dead.

01:29:39.338 --> 01:29:43.175
Or what it mean if you fail me.

01:29:46.428 --> 01:29:49.306
Don't you forget
why you had to bring me back.

01:29:49.389 --> 01:29:53.101
Why I could not leave Jack
to his well-deserved fate.

01:29:54.019 --> 01:29:56.522
It took nine pirate lords
to bind you, Calypso.

01:29:57.064 --> 01:30:00.400
And it'll take no less than nine
to set you free.

01:30:00.442 --> 01:30:02.653
Masters Pintel and Ragetti.

01:30:04.488 --> 01:30:07.574
Take this fishwife to the brig.

01:30:09.409 --> 01:30:11.537
Right this way, Mrs. Fish.

01:30:39.398 --> 01:30:43.360
I cannot be summoned
like some mongrel pup.

01:30:43.443 --> 01:30:45.404
Apparently, you can.

01:30:45.946 --> 01:30:47.573
I believe you know each other.

01:30:52.327 --> 01:30:56.456
Come to join my crew again,
Master Turner?

01:30:56.540 --> 01:30:57.916
Not yours.

01:30:58.333 --> 01:30:59.543
His.

01:31:00.460 --> 01:31:02.546
Jack Sparrow sends his regards.

01:31:03.672 --> 01:31:05.507
Sparrow?
Sparrow?

01:31:06.925 --> 01:31:08.552
You didn't tell him.

01:31:08.594 --> 01:31:11.847
We rescued Jack from the Locker
along with the Black Pearl.

01:31:12.639 --> 01:31:15.517
What else have you not told me?

01:31:16.310 --> 01:31:20.272
There is an issue far more troublesome.

01:31:21.607 --> 01:31:25.235
I believe you're familiar
with a person called Calypso.

01:31:27.863 --> 01:31:29.573
Not a person.

01:31:30.282 --> 01:31:31.366
A heathen god.

01:31:31.450 --> 01:31:34.953
One who delights in cursing men
with their wildest dreams

01:31:35.037 --> 01:31:38.373
and then revealing them to be
hollow and naught but ash.

01:31:38.457 --> 01:31:41.585
- The world is well rid of her.
- Not quite so well, actually.

01:31:42.503 --> 01:31:45.088
The Brethren Court
intends to release her.

01:31:45.881 --> 01:31:47.674
No! They cannot!

01:31:47.758 --> 01:31:50.719
The First Court
promised to imprison her forever.

01:31:50.803 --> 01:31:53.764
- That was our agreement.
- Your agreement?

01:31:56.308 --> 01:32:00.312
I showed them how to bind her.

01:32:00.354 --> 01:32:02.314
She could not be trusted.

01:32:02.397 --> 01:32:04.233
I... She gave me no choice.

01:32:04.817 --> 01:32:07.736
We must act before they release her.

01:32:07.820 --> 01:32:09.571
You loved her.

01:32:10.823 --> 01:32:12.783
She's the one.

01:32:12.825 --> 01:32:14.827
And then you betrayed her.

01:32:14.910 --> 01:32:18.705
She pretended to love me.

01:32:18.789 --> 01:32:22.543
She betrayed me.

01:32:25.379 --> 01:32:28.924
And after which betrayal
did you cut out your heart, I wonder.

01:32:32.219 --> 01:32:34.888
Do not test me.

01:32:34.972 --> 01:32:36.682
I hadn't finished that.

01:32:38.684 --> 01:32:40.853
You will free my father.

01:32:41.562 --> 01:32:44.022
And you will guarantee
Elizabeth's safety.

01:32:44.064 --> 01:32:45.691
Along with my own.

01:32:45.732 --> 01:32:48.318
Your terms are steep, Mr. Turner.

01:32:48.402 --> 01:32:51.155
We will expect fair value in return.

01:32:51.572 --> 01:32:55.534
There is only one price I will accept:

01:32:55.576 --> 01:32:58.662
Calypso murdered.

01:33:00.581 --> 01:33:02.875
Calypso's aboard the Black Pearl.

01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.338
Jack has sailed
the Black Pearl to Shipwreck Cove.

01:33:09.381 --> 01:33:14.595
And with you no longer aboard her,
how do you propose to lead us there?

01:33:26.440 --> 01:33:29.026
What is it you want most?

01:34:00.933 --> 01:34:02.518
Look at them all.

01:34:02.601 --> 01:34:06.688
There's not been a gathering
like this in our lifetime.

01:34:07.481 --> 01:34:09.483
And I owe them all money.

01:34:14.905 --> 01:34:17.366
As he who issued summons,

01:34:17.449 --> 01:34:21.995
I convene this,
the Fourth Brethren Court.

01:34:26.083 --> 01:34:29.545
To confirm your lordship
and right to be heard,

01:34:29.670 --> 01:34:34.383
present now your pieces of eight,
my fellow cap'ns.

01:34:42.516 --> 01:34:45.727
Those aren't pieces of eight.
They're just pieces of junk.

01:34:45.811 --> 01:34:49.523
Aye. The original plan was to use
nine pieces of eight to bind Calypso.

01:34:49.606 --> 01:34:53.944
But when the First Court met,
the Brethren were to a one skint broke.

01:34:54.653 --> 01:34:55.696
So change the name.

01:34:56.905 --> 01:35:01.118
To "nine pieces of whatever we happened
to have in our pockets at the time?"

01:35:01.201 --> 01:35:03.495
Oh, yes. That sounds very piratey.

01:35:07.166 --> 01:35:09.626
Master Ragetti, if you will.

01:35:10.461 --> 01:35:13.464
I kept it safe, just like
you said when you gave it to me.

01:35:13.505 --> 01:35:16.633
Aye, you have.
But now I need it back.

01:35:19.511 --> 01:35:20.596
Sparrow.
Sparrow

01:35:26.685 --> 01:35:30.314
Might I point out that
we are still short one pirate lord,

01:35:30.397 --> 01:35:34.359
and I'm as content as a cucumber
to wait until Sao Feng joins us.

01:35:34.443 --> 01:35:36.028
Sao Feng is dead.

01:35:38.197 --> 01:35:40.282
He fell to the Flying Dutchman.

01:35:40.532 --> 01:35:41.658
The plagued ship.

01:35:42.910 --> 01:35:46.288
He made you captain? They're
giving the bloody title away now.

01:35:46.371 --> 01:35:49.333
Listen. Listen to me.

01:35:49.374 --> 01:35:51.627
Our location has been betrayed.

01:35:51.710 --> 01:35:55.339
Jones is under the command of
Lord Beckett. They're on their way here.

01:35:55.422 --> 01:35:59.092
- Who is this betrayer?
- Not likely anyone among us.

01:35:59.468 --> 01:36:01.512
- Where's Will?
- Not among us.

01:36:01.553 --> 01:36:04.306
It matters not how they found us.
The question is,

01:36:04.389 --> 01:36:06.850
what will we do now that they have?

01:36:06.934 --> 01:36:08.435
We fight.

01:36:12.523 --> 01:36:15.943
Shipwreck Cove is a fortress.

01:36:16.026 --> 01:36:18.821
A well-supplied fortress.

01:36:19.404 --> 01:36:23.242
There is no need to fight
if they cannot get to us.

01:36:23.992 --> 01:36:27.371
There be a third course.

01:36:28.622 --> 01:36:31.041
In another age, at this very spot,

01:36:31.083 --> 01:36:36.588
the First Brethren Court captured the
sea goddess and bound her in her bones.

01:36:39.341 --> 01:36:40.801
That was a mistake.

01:36:41.802 --> 01:36:44.555
Oh, we tamed the seas
for ourselves, aye.

01:36:45.514 --> 01:36:48.600
But opened the door
to Beckett and his ilk.

01:36:50.602 --> 01:36:53.063
Better were the days
when mastery of seas

01:36:53.105 --> 01:36:56.942
came not from bargains
struck with eldritch creatures,

01:36:57.025 --> 01:37:01.405
but from the sweat of a man's brow
and the strength of his back alone.

01:37:01.446 --> 01:37:03.282
You all know this to be true.

01:37:04.116 --> 01:37:05.492
Gentlemen.

01:37:06.618 --> 01:37:07.744
Ladies.

01:37:12.416 --> 01:37:15.419
We must free Calypso.

01:37:24.428 --> 01:37:26.847
- Shoot him.
- Cut out his tongue!

01:37:26.930 --> 01:37:30.809
Shoot him, cut out his tongue, then
shoot his tongue. And trim that beard.

01:37:30.893 --> 01:37:33.437
Sao Feng would've agreed with Barbossa.

01:37:33.520 --> 01:37:36.398
Calypso was our enemy then,
she will be our enemy now.

01:37:36.482 --> 01:37:38.400
It's unlikely her mood's improved.

01:37:38.484 --> 01:37:42.321
I would still agree with Sao Feng.
We release Calypso.

01:37:42.362 --> 01:37:45.324
- You threaten me?
- I silence you.

01:37:57.544 --> 01:38:00.714
- This is madness.
- This is politics.

01:38:00.798 --> 01:38:03.383
Meanwhile, our enemies
are bearing down upon us.

01:38:03.467 --> 01:38:05.969
If they not be here already.

01:38:42.214 --> 01:38:44.550
My sweet.

01:38:44.883 --> 01:38:47.010
You come for me.

01:38:47.970 --> 01:38:52.933
- You were expecting me.
- It has been torture.

01:38:53.016 --> 01:38:57.229
Trapped in this single form.

01:38:57.771 --> 01:39:00.149
Cut off from the sea.

01:39:00.607 --> 01:39:03.193
From all that I love.

01:39:04.486 --> 01:39:05.904
From you.

01:39:06.572 --> 01:39:11.118
Ten years I devoted
to the duty you charged to me.

01:39:12.494 --> 01:39:17.916
Ten years I looked after
those who died at sea.

01:39:18.584 --> 01:39:23.130
And, finally,
when we could be together again...

01:39:24.923 --> 01:39:28.719
...you weren't there.

01:39:29.094 --> 01:39:31.722
Why weren't you there?

01:39:35.142 --> 01:39:36.727
It's my nature.

01:39:37.936 --> 01:39:42.566
Would you love me
if I was anything but what I am?

01:39:43.734 --> 01:39:47.529
I do not love you.

01:39:50.032 --> 01:39:53.744
Many things you were, Davy Jones.

01:39:54.786 --> 01:39:56.914
But never cruel.

01:39:57.789 --> 01:40:00.751
You have corrupted your purpose...

01:40:02.127 --> 01:40:04.713
...and so your self.

01:40:05.798 --> 01:40:10.636
And you did hide away
what should always have been mine.

01:40:30.531 --> 01:40:33.617
Calypso.

01:40:36.662 --> 01:40:38.497
I will be free.

01:40:40.457 --> 01:40:44.169
And when I am,
I would give you my heart.

01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.923
And we would be together always.

01:40:48.549 --> 01:40:51.927
If only you had a heart to give.

01:40:56.682 --> 01:40:58.767
Why did you come?

01:41:16.034 --> 01:41:21.206
And what fate have you planned
for your captors?

01:41:21.623 --> 01:41:23.625
The Brethren Court?

01:41:25.586 --> 01:41:30.382
All of them, the last thing
they will learn in this life...

01:41:30.466 --> 01:41:33.177
...is how cruel I can be.

01:41:37.723 --> 01:41:42.186
And what of your fate, Davy Jones?

01:41:43.687 --> 01:41:47.191
My heart will always belong to you.

01:42:00.579 --> 01:42:04.374
It was the First Court
what imprisoned Calypso.

01:42:04.416 --> 01:42:06.752
We should be the ones to set her free.

01:42:06.794 --> 01:42:11.131
And in her gratitude,
she will see fit to grant us boons.

01:42:11.215 --> 01:42:13.675
Whose boons? Your boons?

01:42:13.759 --> 01:42:16.720
Utterly deceptive twaddle-speak, says I.

01:42:16.804 --> 01:42:21.225
If you have a better alternative,
please, share.

01:42:22.476 --> 01:42:23.519
Cuttlefish.

01:42:24.728 --> 01:42:26.772
Aye.

01:42:27.773 --> 01:42:30.400
Let us not, dear friends,

01:42:30.442 --> 01:42:33.445
forget our dear friends, the cuttlefish.

01:42:33.987 --> 01:42:36.198
Flipping glorious little sausages.

01:42:36.281 --> 01:42:40.202
Pen them up together, they'll devour
each other without a second thought.

01:42:40.285 --> 01:42:41.578
Human nature, isn't it?

01:42:41.662 --> 01:42:43.664
Or... Or fish nature.

01:42:43.747 --> 01:42:47.459
So, yes, we could hole up here
well-provisioned and well-armed.

01:42:47.543 --> 01:42:49.711
Half of us would be dead
within the month.

01:42:49.795 --> 01:42:53.715
Which seems quite grim to me,
any way you slice it. Or...

01:42:55.592 --> 01:42:56.927
Uh...

01:42:58.637 --> 01:43:04.434
As my learned colleague
so naively suggests,

01:43:04.476 --> 01:43:08.480
we can release Calypso, and we
can pray that she will be merciful.

01:43:09.982 --> 01:43:11.275
I rather doubt it.

01:43:12.067 --> 01:43:16.071
Can we pretend she's anything
other than a woman scorned

01:43:16.155 --> 01:43:19.032
like which fury hell hath no? We cannot.

01:43:20.200 --> 01:43:23.453
Res ipsa loquitur, tabula in naufragio.

01:43:23.495 --> 01:43:26.290
We are left with but one option.

01:43:26.331 --> 01:43:30.210
I agree with, and I cannot believe
the words are coming out of me mouth...

01:43:32.504 --> 01:43:35.466
...Captain Swann. We must fight.

01:43:35.507 --> 01:43:38.760
- You've always run away from a fight.
- Have not.

01:43:38.844 --> 01:43:39.887
- Have so.
- Have not.

01:43:40.012 --> 01:43:41.096
- Have so.
- Have not!

01:43:41.221 --> 01:43:44.391
- You have so, and you know it.
- Have not. Slander and calumny.

01:43:44.475 --> 01:43:48.770
I have only ever embraced that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

01:43:48.854 --> 01:43:53.025
I submit that here now
that is what we all must do:

01:43:53.108 --> 01:43:54.526
We must fight...

01:43:55.277 --> 01:43:56.778
...to run away.

01:43:56.862 --> 01:43:59.198
- Aye!
- Aye!

01:44:00.949 --> 01:44:05.412
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,
As per the code, an act of war,
and this be exactly that,

01:44:05.454 --> 01:44:08.373
can only be declared by the pirate king.

01:44:08.415 --> 01:44:11.001
- You made that up.
- Did I, now?

01:44:11.043 --> 01:44:15.589
I call on Cap'n Teague,
keeper of the code.

01:44:16.590 --> 01:44:20.052
Sri Sumbhajee proclaims
this all to be folly!

01:44:21.678 --> 01:44:24.181
Hang the code. Who cares a...?

01:44:32.189 --> 01:44:34.024
Code is the law.

01:44:46.036 --> 01:44:48.038
You're in my way, boy.

01:44:57.256 --> 01:44:59.883
- The code.
- The code.

01:44:59.925 --> 01:45:02.219
As set forth by Morgan and Bartholomew.

01:45:20.237 --> 01:45:24.199
- That can't... How did...
- Sea turtles, mate.

01:45:27.077 --> 01:45:28.579
Sea turtles.

01:45:43.343 --> 01:45:46.054
Ah. Barbossa is right.

01:45:46.138 --> 01:45:47.598
Hang on a minute.

01:45:49.099 --> 01:45:51.059
"It shall be the duties, as the king,

01:45:51.143 --> 01:45:54.563
to declare war,
parley with shared adversaries..."

01:45:54.646 --> 01:45:55.647
Fancy that.

01:45:55.731 --> 01:45:58.192
There has not been a king
since the First Court.

01:45:58.275 --> 01:45:59.943
And that's not likely to change.

01:45:59.985 --> 01:46:02.029
- Not likely.
- Why not?

01:46:02.154 --> 01:46:04.781
See, the pirate king
is elected by popular vote.

01:46:04.865 --> 01:46:08.368
And each pirate
only ever votes for hisself.

01:46:08.452 --> 01:46:09.536
I call for a vote.

01:46:14.333 --> 01:46:16.710
I vote for Ammand the corsair.

01:46:16.794 --> 01:46:19.338
Capitaine Chevalle,
the penniless Frenchman.

01:46:19.713 --> 01:46:22.382
Sri Sumbhajee
votes for Sri Sumbhajee.

01:46:23.300 --> 01:46:25.219
Mistress Ching.

01:46:25.302 --> 01:46:26.678
Gentleman Jocard.

01:46:27.387 --> 01:46:29.973
- Elizabeth Swann.
- Barbossa.
- Elizabeth Swann
- Barbossa

01:46:30.015 --> 01:46:31.809
Vallenueva!
Vallenueva

01:46:32.643 --> 01:46:33.977
Elizabeth Swann.
Elizabeth Swann

01:46:35.020 --> 01:46:36.939
- What?
- I know. Curious, isn't it?

01:46:39.483 --> 01:46:41.109
Vote for me. Vote for me.

01:46:43.570 --> 01:46:44.988
What you talking about?

01:46:45.072 --> 01:46:46.156
No!

01:46:46.240 --> 01:46:49.827
Am I to understand that you lot
will not be keeping to the code, then?

01:46:58.752 --> 01:46:59.920
Very well.

01:47:03.298 --> 01:47:08.303
What say you, Captain Swann,
king of the Brethren Court?

01:47:10.264 --> 01:47:12.599
Prepare every vessel that floats.

01:47:13.433 --> 01:47:14.601
At dawn...

01:47:16.186 --> 01:47:17.354
...we're at war.

01:47:21.191 --> 01:47:24.778
And so we shall go to war.

01:47:38.459 --> 01:47:39.460
What?

01:47:40.461 --> 01:47:43.213
You've seen it all,
done it all. You survived.

01:47:43.755 --> 01:47:46.592
That's the trick, isn't it?
To survive?

01:47:47.176 --> 01:47:50.637
It's not just about
living forever, Jackie.

01:47:54.600 --> 01:47:58.687
The trick is
living with yourself forever.

01:48:02.733 --> 01:48:03.901
How's Mum?

01:48:10.824 --> 01:48:12.367
She looks great.

01:48:33.806 --> 01:48:37.392
The enemy is here! Let's take them!

01:49:00.749 --> 01:49:03.252
Abandon ship. Abandon ship.

01:49:12.177 --> 01:49:13.345
Parley?

01:50:10.152 --> 01:50:13.780
You be the cur that led
these wolves to our door.

01:50:13.864 --> 01:50:18.035
Don't blame Turner.
He was merely the tool of your betrayal.

01:50:18.118 --> 01:50:22.664
If you wish to see its grand architect,
look to your left.

01:50:26.084 --> 01:50:27.753
My hands are clean in this.

01:50:28.796 --> 01:50:29.963
Figuratively.

01:50:30.506 --> 01:50:32.966
My actions were my own
and to my own purpose.

01:50:33.050 --> 01:50:36.470
- Jack had nothing to do with it.
- Well spoke. Listen to the tool.

01:50:36.553 --> 01:50:38.514
Will, I've been aboard the Dutchman.

01:50:39.473 --> 01:50:42.768
I understand the burden you bear,
but I fear that cause is lost.

01:50:43.602 --> 01:50:47.481
No cause is lost if there is
but one fool left to fight for it.

01:50:49.733 --> 01:50:54.613
If Turner wasn't acting on your behalf,
then how did he come to give me this?

01:50:55.823 --> 01:51:00.786
You made a deal with me, Jack, to
deliver the pirates. And here they are.

01:51:01.578 --> 01:51:04.957
Don't be bashful. Step up.
Claim your reward.

01:51:04.998 --> 01:51:08.919
Your debt to me
is still to be satisfied.

01:51:09.002 --> 01:51:13.924
One hundred years in servitude
aboard the Dutchman. As a start.

01:51:14.633 --> 01:51:17.845
That debt was paid, mate.
With some help.

01:51:17.928 --> 01:51:20.305
- You escaped.
- Technically.

01:51:20.389 --> 01:51:22.432
I propose an exchange.

01:51:24.518 --> 01:51:26.395
Will leaves with us...

01:51:27.146 --> 01:51:28.897
...and you can take Jack.

01:51:30.983 --> 01:51:31.984
Done.

01:51:32.693 --> 01:51:34.361
- Undone.
- Done.

01:51:34.444 --> 01:51:37.948
Jack's one of the nine pirate lords.
You have no right.

01:51:38.031 --> 01:51:39.491
King.

01:51:41.994 --> 01:51:46.081
- As you command, your nibs.
- Blackguard!

01:51:51.295 --> 01:51:54.965
If ye have something to say,
I might be saying something as well.

01:51:57.676 --> 01:51:59.678
First to the finish, then?

01:52:20.991 --> 01:52:23.535
Do you fear death?

01:52:25.078 --> 01:52:26.872
You've no idea.

01:52:29.792 --> 01:52:31.668
Advise your Brethren,

01:52:31.752 --> 01:52:34.838
you can fight, and all of you will die.

01:52:34.922 --> 01:52:39.426
Or you can not fight,
in which case only most of you will die.

01:52:40.010 --> 01:52:42.095
You murdered my father.

01:52:43.472 --> 01:52:45.474
He chose his own fate.

01:52:46.099 --> 01:52:48.852
And you have chosen yours.

01:52:48.894 --> 01:52:50.979
We will fight.

01:52:51.563 --> 01:52:53.398
And you will die.

01:52:58.195 --> 01:52:59.822
So be it.

01:53:05.828 --> 01:53:07.204
King?

01:53:07.246 --> 01:53:10.082
Of the Brethren Court.
Courtesy of Jack.

01:53:10.582 --> 01:53:12.918
Maybe he really
does know what he's doing.

01:53:19.383 --> 01:53:20.342
Bravo!

01:53:21.426 --> 01:53:25.597
You've successfully arrived aboard
the Dutchman as per the overall scheme.

01:53:25.681 --> 01:53:27.432
- Look
- Oh, yes. Chapeau, mate.

01:53:27.474 --> 01:53:30.561
Except for this sojourn in the brig,
it's utter clockwork.

01:53:31.812 --> 01:53:32.980
Go away.

01:53:33.063 --> 01:53:36.233
- What, back to the Locker?
- Not without you, Jackie.

01:53:37.067 --> 01:53:38.152
Stab the heart.

01:53:44.032 --> 01:53:49.163
Live forever as captain
of the Flying Dutchman.

01:53:52.958 --> 01:53:54.585
Then again...

01:53:55.419 --> 01:53:57.129
...if you're in the brig...

01:53:58.630 --> 01:54:00.591
...who's to stab the heart?

01:54:03.135 --> 01:54:06.013
Does seem to put immortality
a bit out of reach.

01:54:07.723 --> 01:54:09.433
Peanut.

01:54:09.475 --> 01:54:12.728
We'll need to use the Black Pearl
as a flagship to lead the attack.

01:54:12.811 --> 01:54:16.982
- Oh, will we now?
- All right, Mrs. Fish. Come on.

01:54:17.566 --> 01:54:20.986
Barbossa, you can't release her.

01:54:21.069 --> 01:54:22.988
We need to give Jack a chance.

01:54:23.572 --> 01:54:28.494
Apologies, Your Majesty. Too long
my fate has not been in me own hands.

01:54:31.371 --> 01:54:32.664
No longer.

01:54:34.666 --> 01:54:36.376
The enemy...

01:54:37.544 --> 01:54:39.880
...has opted for oblivion.

01:54:43.008 --> 01:54:44.635
Ready the fleet.

01:54:44.885 --> 01:54:47.638
- To your stations.
- To your stations.

01:54:54.102 --> 01:54:57.272
Be there some manner
of rite or incantation?

01:54:57.356 --> 01:54:58.607
Aye.

01:54:59.024 --> 01:55:02.319
The items brought together, done.

01:55:02.361 --> 01:55:04.780
Items to be burned...

01:55:05.447 --> 01:55:07.616
...and someone must speak the words:

01:55:07.699 --> 01:55:11.161
"Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds."

01:55:11.245 --> 01:55:12.246
Is that it?

01:55:12.830 --> 01:55:16.875
'Tis said it must be spoken
as if to a lover.

01:55:16.959 --> 01:55:18.669
Ooh!

01:55:22.714 --> 01:55:28.011
Calypso, I release you
from your human bonds!

01:55:37.604 --> 01:55:41.692
- Is that it?
- No, no, no. He didn't say it right.

01:55:46.613 --> 01:55:47.656
He didn't...

01:55:48.115 --> 01:55:49.992
You have to say it right.

01:55:58.584 --> 01:55:59.585
Calypso...

01:56:04.965 --> 01:56:07.384
...I release you from your human bonds.

01:56:25.986 --> 01:56:27.696
Tia Dalma.
Tia Dalma

01:56:30.115 --> 01:56:31.450
Calypso.

01:56:33.952 --> 01:56:38.081
When the Brethren Court imprisoned you,
who was it that told them how?

01:56:40.542 --> 01:56:44.463
- Who was it that betrayed you?
- Name him.

01:56:45.714 --> 01:56:47.466
Davy Jones.
Davy Jones

01:57:01.480 --> 01:57:05.317
This is it! This is it!

01:57:47.943 --> 01:57:49.695
Calypso!

01:57:51.905 --> 01:57:57.035
I come before you as but a servant,
humble and contrite.

01:57:58.954 --> 01:58:03.834
I have fulfilled me vow
and now ask your favor.

01:58:06.879 --> 01:58:09.840
Spare meself, me ship, me crew...

01:58:10.257 --> 01:58:14.720
...but unleash your fury upon those who
dare pretend themselves your masters...

01:58:15.220 --> 01:58:16.388
...or mine.

01:59:14.321 --> 01:59:15.572
Is that it?

01:59:18.325 --> 01:59:20.327
Why, she's no help at all.

01:59:24.039 --> 01:59:25.332
What now?

01:59:26.250 --> 01:59:27.501
Nothing.

01:59:28.293 --> 01:59:31.255
Our final hope has failed us.

01:59:58.699 --> 02:00:01.702
- It's not over.
- There's still a fight to be had.

02:00:01.785 --> 02:00:05.706
We've an armada against us, and
with the Dutchman, there's no chance.

02:00:05.789 --> 02:00:08.083
There's only a fool's chance.

02:00:08.167 --> 02:00:10.919
Revenge won't bring
your father back, Miss Swann,

02:00:11.003 --> 02:00:14.256
and it's not something
I'm intending to die for.

02:00:19.219 --> 02:00:20.721
You're right.

02:00:26.101 --> 02:00:28.061
Then what shall we die for?

02:00:31.773 --> 02:00:33.192
You will listen to me.

02:00:33.901 --> 02:00:35.152
Listen!

02:00:38.113 --> 02:00:43.160
The Brethren will still be looking here
to us, to the Black Pearl, to lead.

02:00:43.744 --> 02:00:45.162
And what will they see?

02:00:45.662 --> 02:00:49.041
Frightened bilge rats
aboard a derelict ship? No.

02:00:49.082 --> 02:00:53.337
No, they will see free men and freedom!

02:00:53.378 --> 02:00:56.840
And what the enemy will see
is the flash of our cannons.

02:00:56.882 --> 02:01:02.137
They will hear the ring of our swords,
and they will know what we can do.

02:01:04.848 --> 02:01:07.142
By the sweat of our brows,

02:01:07.226 --> 02:01:09.561
and the strength of our backs...

02:01:09.937 --> 02:01:12.940
...and the courage of our hearts.

02:01:15.651 --> 02:01:17.152
Gentlemen...

02:01:19.863 --> 02:01:21.323
...hoist the colors.

02:01:23.367 --> 02:01:24.785
Hoist the colors.

02:01:24.868 --> 02:01:27.162
- Hoist the colors.
- Hoist the colors!

02:01:27.246 --> 02:01:29.289
Aye.

02:01:29.373 --> 02:01:33.001
The wind's on our side, boys.
That's all we need!

02:01:35.003 --> 02:01:37.089
Hoist the colors!

02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:30.350
We have a favorable wind, sir.

02:02:31.101 --> 02:02:32.269
Oh, so we do.

02:02:32.936 --> 02:02:35.898
Signal Jones to give no quarter.

02:02:36.940 --> 02:02:38.984
That should brighten his day.

02:02:42.946 --> 02:02:46.867
To arms! We give no quarter!

02:02:56.126 --> 02:02:57.920
Calypso.

02:03:24.530 --> 02:03:27.491
Have you noticed,
on top of everything, it's raining?

02:03:27.533 --> 02:03:28.617
That's a bad sign.

02:03:28.700 --> 02:03:33.622
Man the capstan. Raise the main topyard.
Keep that powder dry.

02:03:48.220 --> 02:03:50.055
Maelstrom!

02:03:53.267 --> 02:03:55.310
Captain Barbossa!

02:03:56.228 --> 02:03:58.272
We need you at the helm.

02:04:00.774 --> 02:04:03.152
Aye, that be true.

02:04:05.445 --> 02:04:10.409
Brace up yards,
you cack-handed deck apes.

02:04:10.659 --> 02:04:14.580
Dying is the day worth living for.

02:04:24.882 --> 02:04:26.508
Veer off!

02:04:26.592 --> 02:04:28.844
She'll not harm us.

02:04:29.344 --> 02:04:31.680
Full-bore and into the abyss.

02:04:32.389 --> 02:04:33.724
Are you mad?

02:04:33.765 --> 02:04:36.768
Ha! You afraid to get wet?

02:04:46.278 --> 02:04:48.655
She's on our stern and gaining.

02:04:48.739 --> 02:04:54.286
More speed!
Haul your wind and hold your water.

02:05:01.251 --> 02:05:03.670
Bow cannons!

02:05:04.171 --> 02:05:06.632
Blow the cannons!

02:05:17.518 --> 02:05:20.437
Take us out or they'll overbear us.

02:05:20.479 --> 02:05:25.400
Nay. Further in.
We'll cut across to faster waters.

02:05:26.610 --> 02:05:28.695
Prepare to broadside.

02:05:39.123 --> 02:05:41.416
Captain the guns. Bear a hand.

02:05:41.500 --> 02:05:45.295
Muster your courage, men.
At the ready.

02:05:52.511 --> 02:05:56.098
Think like the whelp. Think like
the whelp. Think like the whelp.

02:05:56.181 --> 02:05:58.350
Hinges. Hinges.

02:05:58.433 --> 02:05:59.726
Think like the whelp.

02:05:59.810 --> 02:06:01.228
Half-barrel hinges.

02:06:01.311 --> 02:06:02.646
Leverage.

02:06:07.609 --> 02:06:09.862
Wish us luck, boys. We'll need it.

02:06:11.321 --> 02:06:14.158
- I miss him already.
- He is quite charming, isn't he?

02:06:14.199 --> 02:06:15.784
Nobody move.

02:06:16.869 --> 02:06:18.620
I dropped me brain.

02:06:28.505 --> 02:06:31.258
Batten down the hatches!

02:06:32.551 --> 02:06:34.595
Stand to your guns.
Stand to your guns.

02:06:35.179 --> 02:06:37.681
Midship cannoneers, sight the masts.

02:06:41.894 --> 02:06:44.354
Main battery at the ready!

02:06:48.901 --> 02:06:53.197
Hold there!
Wait till we're board-and-board.

02:06:57.743 --> 02:06:59.495
Fire!

02:06:59.870 --> 02:07:04.208
- Fire!
- Fire! Fire all!

02:07:05.125 --> 02:07:06.293
Fire!

02:07:10.172 --> 02:07:11.715
Fire!

02:07:21.308 --> 02:07:22.768
Come on, men.

02:07:32.778 --> 02:07:37.407
It be too late
to alter course now, mateys.

02:07:41.787 --> 02:07:44.039
Halt there or we'll shoot.

02:07:45.541 --> 02:07:46.667
Good one.

02:07:49.128 --> 02:07:51.171
I just come to get me effects.

02:07:52.798 --> 02:07:56.969
Admirable though it may be, why are
you here when you could be elsewhere?

02:07:57.052 --> 02:07:59.304
Someone has to stay
and guard the chest.

02:08:00.806 --> 02:08:05.352
There's no question, there's a breakdown
in military discipline on this vessel.

02:08:05.435 --> 02:08:07.062
I blame the fish people.

02:08:07.146 --> 02:08:11.525
Oh, so fish people,
by dint of being fish people,

02:08:11.608 --> 02:08:14.820
automatically aren't
as disciplined as non-fish people?

02:08:14.903 --> 02:08:17.281
Seems contributory,
is all I'm suggesting.

02:08:17.322 --> 02:08:22.244
It's true, if there were no fish people,
there'd be no need to guard the chest.

02:08:22.327 --> 02:08:25.747
And if there were no chest
we wouldn't need to be here to guard it.

02:08:33.297 --> 02:08:35.299
Prepare to board!

02:08:36.967 --> 02:08:38.135
Cover!

02:08:54.818 --> 02:08:56.528
No!

02:09:22.471 --> 02:09:27.434
Lookee here, boys. A lost bird.

02:09:27.518 --> 02:09:31.396
A lost bird that never learned to fly.

02:09:32.731 --> 02:09:34.483
To my great regret.

02:09:35.776 --> 02:09:36.902
But...

02:09:39.655 --> 02:09:41.657
...never too late to learn, eh?

02:09:49.832 --> 02:09:51.291
Whoa!

02:09:57.923 --> 02:10:01.260
The chest, hand it over.

02:10:01.343 --> 02:10:03.178
I can set you free, mate.

02:10:03.262 --> 02:10:06.265
My freedOm waS fOrfeit IOng agO.

02:10:53.312 --> 02:10:54.646
Elizabeth!

02:10:58.442 --> 02:10:59.651
Elizabeth...

02:11:00.694 --> 02:11:02.070
Will you marry me?

02:11:03.864 --> 02:11:05.699
I don't think now's the best time.

02:11:09.495 --> 02:11:11.580
Now may be the only time.

02:11:16.794 --> 02:11:17.961
I love you.

02:11:23.926 --> 02:11:26.470
I've made my choice. What's yours?

02:11:27.304 --> 02:11:28.597
Barbossa.

02:11:30.057 --> 02:11:31.475
Marry us.

02:11:32.601 --> 02:11:35.270
I'm a little busy at the moment.

02:11:41.485 --> 02:11:43.445
Barbossa, now.

02:11:45.155 --> 02:11:46.490
Fine, then.

02:11:57.376 --> 02:12:00.462
Dearly beloved,
we be gathered here today...

02:12:01.171 --> 02:12:04.716
To nail your gizzards
to the mast, you poxy cur.

02:12:09.596 --> 02:12:12.641
Elizabeth Swann,
do you take me to be your husband?
Elizabeth Swann...

02:12:12.683 --> 02:12:14.685
- I do.
- Great.

02:12:21.150 --> 02:12:23.402
Will Turner, do you take me...

02:12:24.695 --> 02:12:26.405
...to be your wife...

02:12:30.826 --> 02:12:32.786
...in sickness and in health...

02:12:33.704 --> 02:12:35.914
...with health being the less likely?

02:12:43.130 --> 02:12:44.381
I do.

02:12:46.633 --> 02:12:49.553
As captain, I now pronounce you...

02:12:52.514 --> 02:12:54.349
You may kiss...

02:13:03.233 --> 02:13:04.651
You may kiss...

02:13:09.615 --> 02:13:11.283
Just kiss.

02:13:49.988 --> 02:13:51.657
Leave it.

02:14:03.919 --> 02:14:06.588
You can do nothing without the key.

02:14:06.672 --> 02:14:08.132
I already have the key.

02:14:09.383 --> 02:14:10.843
No, you don't.

02:14:12.302 --> 02:14:13.637
Oh, that key.

02:14:49.673 --> 02:14:50.674
No!

02:15:17.743 --> 02:15:20.245
Oi. My pistol.

02:15:47.940 --> 02:15:49.358
Turner.
Turner

02:15:54.363 --> 02:15:55.364
Fire!

02:16:01.286 --> 02:16:02.871
Thank you, Jack.

02:16:32.692 --> 02:16:34.236
Stop! It's me.

02:16:36.737 --> 02:16:39.657
It's Will. Your son.

02:17:40.761 --> 02:17:42.221
Go!

02:18:00.656 --> 02:18:04.700
Harridan! You'll see no mercy from me.

02:18:04.785 --> 02:18:07.120
That's why I brought this.

02:18:26.557 --> 02:18:29.768
I'm not going to kill you.
I made you a promise.

02:18:38.402 --> 02:18:39.736
Missed.

02:18:40.946 --> 02:18:45.784
Did you forget?
I'm a heartless wretch.

02:19:02.342 --> 02:19:05.637
Ah. Love.

02:19:06.013 --> 02:19:09.516
A dreadful bond.

02:19:10.308 --> 02:19:15.272
And yet, so easily severed.

02:19:15.355 --> 02:19:20.568
Tell me, William Turner,
do you fear death?

02:19:20.652 --> 02:19:22.070
Do you?

02:19:32.831 --> 02:19:36.502
Heady tonic, holding life and death
in the palm of one's hand.

02:19:37.127 --> 02:19:41.507
You're a cruel man, Jack Sparrow.

02:19:42.382 --> 02:19:44.802
Cruel is a matter of perspective.

02:19:45.385 --> 02:19:46.969
Is it?

02:20:12.704 --> 02:20:13.831
Will?

02:20:15.457 --> 02:20:18.043
Look at me! Stay with me!
You're all right.

02:20:23.924 --> 02:20:25.592
William?

02:20:26.051 --> 02:20:27.719
My son.

02:20:39.606 --> 02:20:43.110
Will? Will?
Look at me. Look at me!

02:20:46.822 --> 02:20:50.742
You will not forestall my judgment.

02:21:06.508 --> 02:21:08.177
Calypso.

02:21:14.016 --> 02:21:19.480
She's taking us down! Make quick
or it's the Locker for us all!

02:21:50.469 --> 02:21:51.512
No.

02:21:55.641 --> 02:21:57.100
No, no.

02:21:57.184 --> 02:21:58.936
No!

02:22:00.187 --> 02:22:04.483
Part of the crew.
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

02:22:04.566 --> 02:22:08.070
Part of the ship, part of the crew.

02:22:08.112 --> 02:22:10.155
Don't leave me.

02:22:11.490 --> 02:22:13.158
Don't. No!

02:22:13.242 --> 02:22:15.119
I won't leave you.

02:22:25.212 --> 02:22:27.422
The Dutchman must have a captain.

02:22:30.759 --> 02:22:32.761
Hold on.

02:23:26.482 --> 02:23:28.150
Thank goodness, Jack.

02:23:28.192 --> 02:23:32.154
The armada's still out there. The
Endeavor's coming up hard to starboard,

02:23:32.237 --> 02:23:36.366
and I think it's time we embrace that
oldest and noblest of pirate traditions.

02:23:36.408 --> 02:23:39.036
Never actually been one for tradition.

02:23:44.041 --> 02:23:47.044
Close haul her.
Luff the sails and lay her in irons.

02:23:47.127 --> 02:23:49.379
Belay that,
or we'll be a sitting duck.

02:23:49.463 --> 02:23:50.798
Belay that "belay that."

02:23:50.881 --> 02:23:52.633
- But the arma...
- Belay.

02:23:52.758 --> 02:23:55.010
- The Endeav...
- Stow. Shut it.

02:24:08.107 --> 02:24:10.109
What are they waiting for?

02:24:11.110 --> 02:24:14.071
He expects us to honor our agreement.

02:24:16.240 --> 02:24:19.076
Ready guns and gun ports.

02:24:22.788 --> 02:24:27.709
It's nothing personal, Jack.
It's just good business.

02:24:54.570 --> 02:24:57.072
Ah, she survived.

02:25:22.181 --> 02:25:25.559
- Ready on the guns.
- Guns ready.

02:25:26.185 --> 02:25:28.353
Full canvas.

02:25:28.437 --> 02:25:30.814
Aye, full canvas.

02:25:55.339 --> 02:25:56.632
Orders, sir.

02:26:00.093 --> 02:26:01.220
Sir!

02:26:01.887 --> 02:26:02.846
Cap'n.

02:26:03.305 --> 02:26:05.933
- Fire.
- Fire!

02:26:06.016 --> 02:26:08.060
- Fire!
- Fire!

02:26:08.143 --> 02:26:10.103
Fire, all!

02:26:20.697 --> 02:26:23.575
Orders? Orders, sir?

02:26:35.963 --> 02:26:37.422
Sir, what do you command?

02:26:38.090 --> 02:26:39.383
It's just...

02:26:41.510 --> 02:26:43.220
...good business.

02:26:44.930 --> 02:26:46.223
Abandon ship!

02:26:46.306 --> 02:26:50.352
- Abandon ship!
- All hands, abandon ship!

02:28:16.105 --> 02:28:17.815
They're turning away!

02:28:30.202 --> 02:28:32.037
Wind in your sails.

02:28:37.292 --> 02:28:39.336
Shiver me timbers.

02:29:00.357 --> 02:29:02.401
Captain Turner!

02:29:17.082 --> 02:29:19.168
- Mr. Gibbs.
- Cap'n?

02:29:20.377 --> 02:29:23.380
- You may throw my hat if you like.
- Aye, aye, cap'n.

02:29:23.422 --> 02:29:25.132
Hooray!

02:29:27.384 --> 02:29:29.136
Now go and get it.

02:29:47.571 --> 02:29:49.156
Orders, sir?

02:29:53.452 --> 02:29:57.456
You're no longer bound
to the Dutchman. You're free.

02:29:57.539 --> 02:29:59.541
Aye.

02:29:59.583 --> 02:30:02.002
That's a fine thing, but...

02:30:03.629 --> 02:30:08.300
...by my reckoning,
I still have a debt that has to be paid.

02:30:08.383 --> 02:30:09.968
If you'll have me.

02:30:14.014 --> 02:30:15.891
On the wheel, then, Mr. Turner.

02:30:17.267 --> 02:30:19.228
Aye, Captain Turner.

02:30:34.201 --> 02:30:36.870
This ship
has a purpose again.

02:30:36.954 --> 02:30:38.956
And where we are bound...

02:30:39.623 --> 02:30:42.126
...she cannot come.

02:30:42.167 --> 02:30:44.169
One day ashore.

02:30:44.211 --> 02:30:46.296
Ten years at sea.

02:30:47.297 --> 02:30:50.134
That's a steep price
for what's been done.

02:30:52.302 --> 02:30:54.263
Depends on the one day.

02:30:57.057 --> 02:30:59.601
Your chariot awaits, Your Highness.

02:31:03.439 --> 02:31:05.441
The oars are inside.

02:31:17.035 --> 02:31:19.037
Mrs. Turner.

02:31:23.917 --> 02:31:25.502
Goodbye, poppet.

02:31:31.300 --> 02:31:32.593
Jack.
Jack

02:31:33.844 --> 02:31:36.346
It would never
have worked out between us.

02:31:39.683 --> 02:31:42.186
Keep telling yourself that, darling.

02:31:45.606 --> 02:31:47.483
Once was quite enough.

02:31:49.902 --> 02:31:51.862
Thank you.

02:32:11.215 --> 02:32:13.175
I'm going to need the other one.

02:32:45.207 --> 02:32:47.209
It's nearly sunset.

02:33:06.353 --> 02:33:08.063
It's always belonged to you.

02:33:13.819 --> 02:33:15.404
Will you keep it safe?

02:33:17.197 --> 02:33:18.365
Yes.

02:33:22.369 --> 02:33:23.454
Yes.

02:33:43.390 --> 02:33:44.391
Will!
Will!

02:33:59.990 --> 02:34:02.159
Keep a weather eye on the horizon.

02:34:31.021 --> 02:34:34.316
Granted it tends to list to port,
and has been, on occasion,

02:34:34.399 --> 02:34:36.610
known to frighten young women.

02:34:36.693 --> 02:34:41.073
But I promise you,
you will not be disappointed.

02:34:41.740 --> 02:34:42.866
Is that it?

02:34:43.492 --> 02:34:44.993
The Black Pearl?

02:34:45.661 --> 02:34:47.746
It's not very big.

02:34:47.830 --> 02:34:50.207
Love, that is a dinghy.

02:34:50.290 --> 02:34:55.671
My vessel is magnificent
and fierce and huge-ish and...

02:34:56.130 --> 02:34:59.258
...gone. Why is it gone?

02:35:00.217 --> 02:35:01.802
Is that it there?

02:35:03.011 --> 02:35:04.138
Yes, there it is.

02:35:05.139 --> 02:35:06.390
Why is it there?

02:35:07.724 --> 02:35:09.309
It's much larger up close.

02:35:09.393 --> 02:35:11.770
Jack, you promised
to take us for a ride.

02:35:11.812 --> 02:35:15.732
- I was to be given the first ride.
- What? You?

02:35:15.816 --> 02:35:18.402
- Not what he said.
- I never!

02:35:20.237 --> 02:35:24.366
Mr. Gibbs? Any particular reason
why my ship is gone?

02:35:24.450 --> 02:35:27.244
The ship? We're on the ship.

02:35:29.913 --> 02:35:32.791
Jack! The ship's gone!

02:35:32.833 --> 02:35:33.876
Really?

02:35:35.961 --> 02:35:39.214
Ladies! Will you please shut it?

02:35:39.298 --> 02:35:42.634
Listen to me.
Yes, I lied to you.

02:35:42.718 --> 02:35:44.219
No, I don't love you.

02:35:44.303 --> 02:35:47.389
Of course it makes you look fat.
I've never been to Brussels.

02:35:47.473 --> 02:35:50.184
It is pronounced "egregious."

02:35:50.267 --> 02:35:54.271
By the way, no, I've never actually
met Pizarro, but I love his pies.

02:35:54.354 --> 02:35:57.065
And all of this pales
to utter insignificance

02:35:57.149 --> 02:36:00.861
in light of the fact that
my ship is once again gone. Savvy?

02:36:13.415 --> 02:36:16.335
- Take what you can.
- Give nothing back.

02:36:20.255 --> 02:36:24.301
Tell me, ladies,
what do you know of sea turtles?

02:36:24.343 --> 02:36:25.469
Sea turtles?

02:36:25.719 --> 02:36:27.971
Let me tell you
the amazing story of Cap...

02:36:28.013 --> 02:36:30.682
All men up the ratlines.

02:36:31.099 --> 02:36:33.894
All men up the ratlines!

02:36:39.024 --> 02:36:41.276
Oh, you want a taste of this?

02:36:42.778 --> 02:36:45.989
Oh, that's a good boy!
You're Daddy's boy.

02:36:46.031 --> 02:36:48.659
Oh, yes, you are.

02:36:48.742 --> 02:36:49.743
Sir?

02:36:51.120 --> 02:36:53.622
Some of the men don't feel
entirely settled

02:36:53.705 --> 02:36:56.208
- about leaving Captain Jack behind.
- Again.

02:36:56.333 --> 02:36:59.253
- Again.
- Is that so?

02:36:59.503 --> 02:37:03.173
It would make us feel a whole lot
better regarding our fortunes

02:37:03.257 --> 02:37:05.968
if we could see that item
you told us about.

02:37:06.051 --> 02:37:08.178
- On the charts.
- Aye.

02:37:08.303 --> 02:37:09.721
With our own eyes.

02:37:09.763 --> 02:37:13.350
To help put an ease
to our burden of guilt, so to speak.

02:37:15.727 --> 02:37:17.938
Feast your eyes upon this, mateys.

02:37:18.355 --> 02:37:20.858
There's more than one way
to live forever.

02:37:20.941 --> 02:37:24.653
Gents, I give you
the Fountain of Youth.

02:37:35.456 --> 02:37:37.332
Sparrow.
Sparrow

02:37:37.833 --> 02:37:42.379
# Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

02:38:08.280 --> 02:38:12.910
# We're devils and black sheep
Really bad eggs

02:38:32.012 --> 02:38:34.640
# DrinK up, me hearties, Yo ho #

02:47:07.069 --> 02:47:11.949
# Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me

02:47:11.990 --> 02:47:15.119
# We pillage, we plunder, We rifle and loot

02:47:15.160 --> 02:47:16.954
# Drink up, me hearties Yo ho

02:47:17.037 --> 02:47:19.665
# We kidnap and ravage
And don't give a hoot

02:47:19.748 --> 02:47:21.583
# Drink up, me hearties. Yo ho

02:47:21.625 --> 02:47:27.256
# Yo ho, yo ho
A pirate's life for me #

02:47:28.305 --> 02:47:34.327
