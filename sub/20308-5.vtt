WEBVTT

00:03.378 --> 00:04.921
(Sid snoring)

00:05.005 --> 00:06.965
Ah! Ow!

00:07.048 --> 00:09.467
Oh, Dottie, come on. Cut it out.

00:10.427 --> 00:13.096
Cut it out, Dottie. No roughhouse.

00:14.973 --> 00:16.349
No, that pinches.

00:17.517 --> 00:18.810
No, that pinches.

00:19.310 --> 00:22.522
It's not my size, Dottie.
I can't-- I can't fit in it.

00:22.814 --> 00:24.274
Oh!

00:25.191 --> 00:26.276
I don't even know.

00:26.985 --> 00:27.902
Whose is that?

00:28.778 --> 00:30.780
Tell them to put it on the hose, Dottie.

00:30.864 --> 00:32.699
Put it on the hose, Dottie!

00:35.660 --> 00:37.078
Ah!

00:38.413 --> 00:39.456
I don't got 'em.

00:40.707 --> 00:41.541
Stay--

00:42.542 --> 00:44.878
That's not mine. I can't eat it that way.

00:45.253 --> 00:46.629
I can't bend it that way.

00:46.713 --> 00:48.631
Ow! Ow!

00:48.715 --> 00:50.091
Ow, Dottie!

00:50.592 --> 00:51.426
Ow!

00:52.427 --> 00:55.847
Ow! Rub it. Rub it on. Rub on it!

00:55.930 --> 00:57.432
Rub it on, Dottie!

00:58.183 --> 00:59.350
Just rub it on.

01:00.810 --> 01:01.644
Oh!

01:02.187 --> 01:03.229
Oh, Dottie.

01:04.689 --> 01:05.523
When...

01:06.024 --> 01:07.192
Oh, very funny.

01:08.234 --> 01:09.069
(slams door)

01:09.152 --> 01:11.571
(gurgles) Ow.

01:12.030 --> 01:12.864
Mm-hmm.

01:13.448 --> 01:15.617
Not where I come from.
It's just the opposite.

01:16.367 --> 01:19.454
Mo-- Motown, Dottie.

01:19.746 --> 01:20.622
Motown.

01:23.750 --> 01:25.460
No, I'm not gonna be the bunny, honey.

01:26.002 --> 01:27.378
I can't. I don't even know.

01:27.837 --> 01:28.671
I don't got it.

01:29.881 --> 01:31.800
Uh-huh. You tell me when.

01:32.884 --> 01:34.260
You tell me when.

01:35.595 --> 01:36.638
Oh, is that so?

01:37.472 --> 01:38.723
Oh, is that so?

01:39.849 --> 01:42.227
Well, I happen to have an amigo.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.687
Uh-huh.

01:45.105 --> 01:46.856
Item seven, assignments.

01:46.940 --> 01:49.901
Sergeant Bates. Officer Flaherty, too.
Lieutenant Buntz.

01:49.984 --> 01:52.821
Also, people, Division Vice is initiating

01:52.904 --> 01:56.574
an undercover operation
at the Eden Roc Health Club,

01:56.658 --> 01:59.702
i.e., a massage parlor
fronting for prostitution.

01:59.786 --> 02:02.539
On loan will be Patrolperson Russo.

02:02.622 --> 02:05.083
-Detectives LaRue...
-All right!

02:05.166 --> 02:07.460
...Washington and Belker.

02:07.544 --> 02:11.339
Item last, people. This is a memo
to all precincts from Chief Daniels.

02:11.422 --> 02:13.550
"Four days ago
at the Polk Avenue precinct,

02:13.633 --> 02:16.886
two White officers failed to support
two Black officers in the field,

02:16.970 --> 02:19.430
resulting in an officer
being critically wounded.

02:19.514 --> 02:24.519
I have today dismissed Officer Brian Grich
and Roland Mahoney from the force

02:24.602 --> 02:27.814
and have turned over our IAD findings
to the district attorney

02:27.897 --> 02:30.984
with recommendations
to file criminal charges.

02:31.067 --> 02:34.946
I am also transferring four officers
from Polk Avenue to other precincts.

02:35.446 --> 02:40.326
Finally, command of Polk Avenue has been
transferred to Captain Stan Williams.

02:41.578 --> 02:44.747
Captain Ray Calletano will be assigned
to Division as my advisor.

02:45.707 --> 02:48.501
This police force
mirrors the society it serves.

02:48.793 --> 02:51.004
This means we have race problems.

02:51.546 --> 02:54.799
It will never mean toleration
of any officer's failure

02:54.883 --> 02:59.554
to perform his duty particularly in regard
to the support of his brother officers."

03:00.805 --> 03:01.639
That's all.

03:01.723 --> 03:03.433
(chattering)

03:05.018 --> 03:05.852
Excuse me.

03:06.519 --> 03:09.981
Uh, we have a late arrival.

03:10.064 --> 03:11.816
A transfer officer James Sanders.

03:11.900 --> 03:14.110
Transferring from where, Sanders?

03:14.194 --> 03:16.237
-Polk Avenue.
-(murmuring)

03:18.156 --> 03:18.990
I see.

03:20.450 --> 03:22.368
Welcome. Dismissed.

03:24.537 --> 03:26.789
Yeah, great to have you aboard.

03:28.499 --> 03:30.585
-Go on.
-No, you go, pal.

03:30.668 --> 03:33.504
-You ain't seeing my back.
-All right, that's enough, gentlemen.

03:34.881 --> 03:36.132
Officer Sanders, go ahead.

03:40.553 --> 03:43.389
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>Dispatch. We have a 9-11.</i>

03:43.473 --> 03:45.183
<i>Armed robbery in progress.</i>

03:45.266 --> 03:49.020
<i>See Surplus Store,</i>
<i>corner People's Drive and 124th Street.</i>

03:49.103 --> 03:50.730
(sirens wailing)

03:56.402 --> 03:59.489
(theme music playing)

05:50.099 --> 05:51.351
Anyone but Flaherty.

05:51.434 --> 05:53.227
The only other availabilities

05:53.311 --> 05:56.731
-are Officers Hill, Renko--
-Good, great.

05:56.814 --> 05:58.691
-...and Sanders.
-Sanders?

05:58.775 --> 06:01.402
Yeah, he's riding with Hill and Renko
on an orientation tour.

06:01.486 --> 06:04.572
Is there any particular thinking
for putting Sanders with a Black cop?

06:06.741 --> 06:09.952
I assigned Officer Sanders
to two veteran police officers

06:10.036 --> 06:12.205
who can familiarize him with the precinct.

06:13.790 --> 06:16.209
Well, great, either I ride with the Judas

06:16.292 --> 06:18.503
or I get to watch <i>Mandingo</i> revisited.

06:19.879 --> 06:23.257
-You ready?
-We understand each other, right, kid?

06:23.800 --> 06:26.094
-You want to drive?
-Perfect, come on.

06:26.177 --> 06:29.555
I know that.
Yes, I'm-I'm totally aware of that.

06:29.639 --> 06:31.307
-I'm sorry, Bobby.
-Hunter assigned us

06:31.391 --> 06:32.975
one of the guys from the Polk.

06:33.059 --> 06:35.520
Good, listen, yeah.
Lieutenant, look, I'm a police officer.

06:35.603 --> 06:37.855
I'm well aware I have to fill out
some kind of theft report.

06:38.147 --> 06:39.982
-What'd they get?
-Yeah. No.

06:40.066 --> 06:42.527
I'm just asking you this, I'd like to have
the professional courtesy

06:42.610 --> 06:44.987
of being able to file the report
in my own precinct

06:45.071 --> 06:49.200
rather than going all the way down
to the Heights by public transportation.

06:49.283 --> 06:50.451
They got your Chevy?

06:50.535 --> 06:52.245
Yeah, yeah. Thank you very much.

06:52.328 --> 06:54.497
-I need a 547.
-Renko, they got Chevy--

06:54.580 --> 06:56.666
-Personal or incident report?
-Personal. They stole my car.

06:56.749 --> 06:59.210
-Bobby, Andy.
-Captain.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.255
-Is Captain Furillo in?
-Yeah, I believe so.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.092
The man lost his command this morning.

07:06.175 --> 07:07.969
Well, I lost my Chevrolet.

07:08.052 --> 07:10.096
-This this guy here from the Polk?
-Yeah.

07:10.763 --> 07:11.681
Let's roll.

07:15.017 --> 07:18.396
Mick, vice operations computer
kicks out names of undercover cops

07:18.479 --> 07:20.231
who haven't yet been used in a given area.

07:20.314 --> 07:22.733
-I don't like that kind of work.
-They need fresh faces.

07:25.611 --> 07:26.446
-Captain.
-Mick.

07:27.864 --> 07:29.490
-Captain let you out, Mick?
-No.

07:29.574 --> 07:31.951
Hey, relax, Belker.
We'll have a couple laughs.

07:32.034 --> 07:32.869
Oh!

07:33.536 --> 07:34.620
Don't do that.

07:38.249 --> 07:39.083
I'm sorry.

07:40.293 --> 07:42.879
I was told it was not
only Daniels' decision.

07:43.212 --> 07:45.465
-I was told there was a panel.
-Yes.

07:45.548 --> 07:46.841
-You were on it.
-Yes.

07:46.924 --> 07:50.219
And you voted to have Williams replace me.
To take away my command.

07:50.511 --> 07:51.846
The precinct had gone renegade.

07:51.929 --> 07:54.098
-An officer was shot.
-It was not my fault.

07:54.182 --> 07:55.975
Well, that's not what was at issue.

07:56.058 --> 07:58.603
What was at issue was how to bring
the precinct back under control.

07:58.686 --> 08:00.813
-I could have done it.
-Maybe you could have.

08:01.355 --> 08:03.107
I just thought Stan Williams
had a better shot.

08:03.524 --> 08:06.986
Are you sure, Frank? Are you sure
your panel didn't just feel

08:07.069 --> 08:09.113
give the Blacks one of their own
to lead them?

08:09.697 --> 08:11.449
You're upset, Ray.
You're saying things you don't mean.

08:11.532 --> 08:13.826
I have given the story
to the <i>Latin Daily Signal.</i>

08:13.910 --> 08:15.828
-What story?
-Of what has been done to me!

08:16.329 --> 08:17.580
I think that's a mistake.

08:17.663 --> 08:19.165
What could happen, Frank?

08:19.707 --> 08:21.751
What is left that I could lose?

08:21.834 --> 08:22.752
Ray.

08:23.753 --> 08:26.047
A reporter will call you
for your statement.

08:26.255 --> 08:28.299
You can confirm or deny it as you see fit.

08:31.761 --> 08:34.096
Male detectives
will be looking to pop the masseuses.

08:34.180 --> 08:35.640
We'll be clients upstairs.

08:36.098 --> 08:37.642
You be a hooker on the street outside.

08:37.725 --> 08:39.477
See if any entering patrons solicit.

08:39.560 --> 08:42.230
-What's my price?
-Rates upstairs are 40 and up.

08:42.688 --> 08:44.857
They'll never believe
she could be that cheap, Detective.

08:44.941 --> 08:47.443
What's the point?
You trying to put heat on the owner?

08:47.527 --> 08:49.820
-Eddie Donuts, right.
-That's Eddie Donatelli's place?

08:49.904 --> 08:52.114
All right, I know where his card room is.

08:52.198 --> 08:55.034
Let me bust his tail light
and give him a ticket.

08:55.117 --> 08:56.744
Attitude problem.

08:56.827 --> 09:00.414
Everyone in sync? Coordinated pop
is ten minutes after we're in the rooms.

09:03.459 --> 09:04.794
C note, minimum.

09:05.336 --> 09:07.922
Not today, okay? I'd really appreciate it.

09:08.005 --> 09:10.007
-How you figure, Neal?
-Could I get out?

09:10.091 --> 09:10.925
Yeah, yeah.

09:11.384 --> 09:13.177
Hey, nobody bats a thousand, lover.

09:13.261 --> 09:15.555
Stories I'm hearing,
this chick will sleep with mud.

09:16.847 --> 09:18.432
Want to give us a hint, Lieutenant?

09:18.516 --> 09:21.102
Gonna put some stink on a guy,
encourage him to relocate.

09:22.436 --> 09:23.563
Got a description?

09:23.980 --> 09:26.023
Just search everybody and look mean.

09:34.907 --> 09:36.576
-Police!
-All right, everybody,

09:36.659 --> 09:38.119
-up against the docks. Come on.
-Up against the docks.

09:38.202 --> 09:40.121
You, too, pal. Come on, everybody.

09:40.204 --> 09:42.415
It's an occupational health inspection.

09:42.498 --> 09:45.167
All right, up against the docks.
Come on! Move it!

09:45.251 --> 09:46.836
Hey, hey, What's the shot?

09:46.919 --> 09:48.588
We got a possible health hazard.

09:48.671 --> 09:51.215
You got an employee, Ace Shanks.
Where is he?

09:51.299 --> 09:54.468
-Half a day off.
-How's the inspection coming, officers?

09:54.552 --> 09:57.138
-Got a little white powder on this one.
-They have pills.

09:57.221 --> 10:00.182
Aw, now you see here? This here is meats.

10:00.266 --> 10:02.935
People eat this here.
You can't have dopers handling it.

10:03.728 --> 10:05.229
Ace Shanks give you this stuff, huh?

10:05.313 --> 10:07.982
-You just say the word, come on.
-Look, can we talk about this?

10:08.065 --> 10:10.067
You got a problem with Shanks?
That's your problem?

10:10.151 --> 10:12.278
You just consider this a warning visit,
all right?

10:12.361 --> 10:14.238
Everybody gets off with a warning.

10:14.322 --> 10:16.949
-Come on.
-Hey, if I got a health problem,

10:17.033 --> 10:19.285
-I deal with the Health Department.
-I'll bet you do.

10:19.368 --> 10:21.412
-This side of beef stinks.
-What?

10:21.495 --> 10:24.498
My uncle's a butcher. This beef is old.

10:24.790 --> 10:27.084
Aged. Aged, not old.

10:27.376 --> 10:29.420
It's, uh, probably Ace's fault. Come on.

10:29.503 --> 10:31.088
Well, I'm notifying the Health Department.

10:31.172 --> 10:33.758
He don't mean it. Come on. Come on.

10:35.468 --> 10:37.637
Would you tell the patrol officer
the purpose of this visit

10:37.720 --> 10:41.474
was to put some stink on this guy Shanks,
not report some health violations.

10:41.557 --> 10:42.933
Plus, didn't he get the drift

10:43.017 --> 10:45.102
that the owner
pays off the Health Department?

10:45.186 --> 10:47.938
So maybe we'll pop who in the Health
Department the owner pays off.

10:48.022 --> 10:50.024
That's great.
We'll go on a pop crusade, right?

10:50.107 --> 10:53.694
-Get all the jaywalkers.
-Will you two please stop this now?

10:53.778 --> 10:55.154
Mary and Joseph.

10:55.279 --> 10:56.489
(car door closes)

10:58.240 --> 11:00.785
MAN:
You said it would all be taken care of.

11:01.035 --> 11:03.579
Now, the thing of it is,
I can't wait the two weeks.

11:03.663 --> 11:06.123
I've got to be out of town
to see my daughter.

11:07.208 --> 11:10.336
Man, what you got coming on telling me
what I can and cannot do?

11:10.628 --> 11:13.005
Any-any idea, sir,
how long you're gonna be here?

11:13.089 --> 11:14.215
Now, I'm gonna drive...

11:14.298 --> 11:17.176
-HENRY: Hey, Steve.
-Henry, hi.

11:18.886 --> 11:20.429
I was just waiting to make a call.

11:21.639 --> 11:23.140
Well, come on in.

11:23.808 --> 11:25.935
I couldn't get through
to this one publisher at the office

11:26.018 --> 11:29.814
so, uh, I figured I'd get him
before he got on a commuter train.

11:35.194 --> 11:36.946
Hadn't heard from you in a couple days.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.322
Yeah, well, I've been busy.

11:38.406 --> 11:40.408
Uh, trying to get
more publishers appointments

11:40.491 --> 11:44.120
and, uh, rewriting those pages I lost
when those kids beat me up.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.997
You know,
when they threw my novel up in the air.

11:47.456 --> 11:48.582
How many pages did you lose?

11:49.083 --> 11:51.252
I found all but five.

11:51.335 --> 11:54.547
I-I had to keep going back
and prowl around.

11:54.630 --> 11:57.633
But I think I've got the five missing ones
pretty much rewritten.

11:59.343 --> 12:02.054
-Is that a gun belt?
-Yeah, um,

12:02.138 --> 12:03.764
I'm passing as an undercover cop.

12:03.848 --> 12:07.643
It's-it's my only way of getting
the people up here to leave me alone.

12:20.239 --> 12:21.073
It's loaded.

12:22.450 --> 12:23.951
Those kids beat me up, Hank.

12:25.119 --> 12:27.121
They destroyed my manuscript.

12:27.872 --> 12:28.706
You got a permit for this?

12:38.799 --> 12:40.092
Steven, what's going on?

12:41.886 --> 12:43.637
-You okay?
-Yeah, I'm upset.

12:43.929 --> 12:45.514
I think I'm naturally upset.

12:46.182 --> 12:47.725
I'm just trying to get
those pages rewritten,

12:47.808 --> 12:49.518
and I just hope I'm getting them right.

12:49.602 --> 12:52.104
Okay. Okay. Look...

12:54.231 --> 12:56.358
I don't want you
holed up in here all the time.

12:58.027 --> 13:00.404
-You want to have lunch today?
-Yeah, that'd be great.

13:03.073 --> 13:04.074
Can I take this?

13:06.660 --> 13:07.495
Noon okay?

13:08.037 --> 13:08.871
Sure.

13:11.290 --> 13:14.668
Hank. Thanks for being my friend.

13:23.177 --> 13:24.637
RENKO: I just don't know
why we can't talk about

13:24.720 --> 13:26.764
whatever it is
you want to talk to me about...

13:28.891 --> 13:32.770
For what it's worth, I got bum rapped
getting tossed in with those other cops.

13:33.562 --> 13:36.482
My partner didn't like your color
and they disciplined both of us.

13:37.775 --> 13:40.528
That's an action corner over there
starting around lunch hour.

13:40.820 --> 13:44.824
Weed, PCP. You name it, they sell it.

13:44.907 --> 13:46.492
I'm just saying,
if you give me half a chance,

13:46.575 --> 13:47.993
I think you'll find out I'm okay.

13:49.370 --> 13:52.164
-Could you excuse us?
-What do you mean?

13:52.623 --> 13:54.917
Could you get out of the vehicle
for a minute, please?

13:57.837 --> 13:59.338
I'll be across the street.

14:03.759 --> 14:07.471
Uh, the theft of my auto may turn out
to be a more complicated matter

14:07.555 --> 14:10.808
-than I first anticipated.
-How's that?

14:10.891 --> 14:13.269
Well, remember last week
when I went to the radiator repair place

14:13.352 --> 14:14.895
and I was saying how the car

14:14.979 --> 14:16.438
-was becoming a losing proposition?
-Yeah, yeah, yeah.

14:16.522 --> 14:19.859
Well, uh, this guy down there
at the car repair place

14:19.942 --> 14:22.570
and I were talking, see,
about how even if I sold it

14:22.653 --> 14:26.699
it would be less than Blue Book
because of Daryl Ann's fender--

14:26.782 --> 14:29.159
Was that the message
you got from the call?

14:29.243 --> 14:31.495
Well, it was a totally innocent
conversation, Robert.

14:31.579 --> 14:34.248
This guy Mike says to me how would I like
to get what the car was worth

14:34.331 --> 14:36.500
to the insurance company
and I said of course, hell yes.

14:36.584 --> 14:39.795
And-and that was it. It was the end
of the conversation. Perfectly innocent--

14:39.879 --> 14:42.006
Well, well, what did he
just say to you on the phone?

14:42.590 --> 14:47.303
That, uh, we should talk at lunch
because we had--

14:47.386 --> 14:50.598
-He stole it.
-I don't know that! Don't say that!

14:51.807 --> 14:53.309
Check out Sanders.

14:53.392 --> 14:56.312
SANDERS: Walk straight to the car,
keep your hands folded behind your back.

14:56.645 --> 14:57.479
Move.

14:59.440 --> 15:01.275
Hey, man, what is your problem?

15:01.358 --> 15:04.320
You know, things usually don't get active
around here until near noon.

15:05.863 --> 15:06.697
Early riser.

15:10.159 --> 15:11.952
(upbeat music playing)

15:19.376 --> 15:21.086
Sorry we're so popular, fellas.

15:21.170 --> 15:22.463
It's all right.

15:23.589 --> 15:25.174
WOMAN: Should be just a few more minutes.

15:25.758 --> 15:27.343
She don't know how right she is.

15:31.513 --> 15:32.890
-Sorry.
-(growls)

15:34.224 --> 15:35.059
Ooh!

15:36.518 --> 15:37.770
All right.

15:40.147 --> 15:42.399
Hey, this cousin of mine

15:42.483 --> 15:45.694
told me a good tip gets a deluxe massage.

15:46.195 --> 15:48.405
(scoffs) What do you mean by that?

15:49.615 --> 15:50.783
What do you think I mean?

15:51.867 --> 15:54.620
You mean the total body massage?

15:54.703 --> 15:56.455
Maybe that's what he meant.

15:58.499 --> 16:00.584
Total body is 40 bucks extra.

16:01.168 --> 16:03.003
-You want my top down?
-What?

16:03.712 --> 16:06.632
You a convertible? (chuckles)

16:07.549 --> 16:09.134
Top down's an extra ten.

16:09.635 --> 16:12.638
Oh, so that's-that's 50 bucks altogether.

16:12.721 --> 16:14.264
Uh-huh. Before.

16:17.977 --> 16:19.520
Check my left pants' pocket.

16:27.152 --> 16:28.153
You're a cop?!

16:28.237 --> 16:29.655
Yeah, you're busted, sweetheart.

16:29.738 --> 16:32.574
Oh, there's no extra charge
for the topless.

16:33.993 --> 16:35.869
Lois! They're cops!

16:35.953 --> 16:38.205
No, you're busted, lady.

16:38.288 --> 16:40.666
No way, you don't get your cake
and eat it.

16:40.749 --> 16:42.292
You're popped, Rhonda.

16:42.376 --> 16:44.586
I have a chronic lower back problem.

16:44.670 --> 16:48.048
-All right, girls, we're going in.
-Hey, this guy got what he came for.

16:48.132 --> 16:50.134
-What's she talking about?
-Nothing.

16:50.217 --> 16:51.343
We'll straighten it out at the station.

16:51.427 --> 16:54.263
Where I come from,
if you do it, it's entrapment.

16:54.346 --> 16:55.806
-You did it?
-I didn't do it.

16:55.889 --> 16:56.765
Did so.

16:56.849 --> 16:58.559
-Come on, come on.
-Jerk.

16:58.642 --> 16:59.518
You big jerk!

17:00.227 --> 17:02.730
I can show you the X-rays.
It's a displaced lumbar disc.

17:02.813 --> 17:05.357
Yeah, this place is famous
for their treatment of that.

17:05.441 --> 17:07.109
I didn't mean it. I was just kidding.

17:07.192 --> 17:09.111
And this is play money, right?

17:16.785 --> 17:18.370
-Morning.
-Hi.

17:18.954 --> 17:21.915
Joyce, can I talk to you? Thirty seconds?

17:23.333 --> 17:26.795
Don't worry, it's not gonna be a protest
of my undying love.

17:28.881 --> 17:30.758
Could you file these
under Clarence Monroe?

17:41.685 --> 17:45.606
Joyce, I just want to say
what happened on Tuesday,

17:45.689 --> 17:47.941
as far as I'm concerned, it happened.

17:48.025 --> 17:50.694
-It's in a time capsule.
-All right.

17:51.070 --> 17:53.322
Because I want us
to keep working together well.

17:53.781 --> 17:56.241
And we can't
if you think I'm looking at you weird.

17:56.992 --> 17:58.160
Which I'm not going to be.

17:59.411 --> 18:01.997
Deal. No weird looks. Time capsule.

18:03.749 --> 18:05.250
What have you got on Clarence Monroe?

18:05.334 --> 18:06.627
How did you get so lucky?

18:07.044 --> 18:08.837
Ugh, what a scum.

18:09.880 --> 18:13.467
He takes a C felony and a nickel
or we go to trial.

18:13.550 --> 18:16.470
Five years?
Irwin, he hasn't been arrested since '84.

18:17.721 --> 18:19.723
Okay, we go to trial, Mr. DA.

18:22.434 --> 18:23.477
Mr. Tough Guy.

18:26.939 --> 18:27.773
Frank.

18:29.483 --> 18:31.610
Did you get a call
from this <i>Spanish Daily Bugle?</i>

18:31.693 --> 18:34.154
<i>Latin Daily Signal.</i> I've been ducking it.

18:34.238 --> 18:37.199
Meaning you know
about Señor Calletano's grandstand play.

18:37.282 --> 18:40.911
Ray came to see me. He said a reporter
might call about his losing his command.

18:40.994 --> 18:42.579
The stones on the guy.

18:42.996 --> 18:45.624
If ever a captain deserved to be relieved
it was him.

18:45.707 --> 18:48.085
In some part of him,
I think he knows that, Chief.

18:48.168 --> 18:50.629
-His pride's been hurt.
-I'm not running a therapy group.

18:50.921 --> 18:52.589
This department's got enough race problems

18:52.673 --> 18:55.008
without someone turning up the heat
under the Latins.

18:55.676 --> 18:57.427
I want you to call your friend Ray.

18:57.511 --> 18:58.804
Tell him I don't think the media

18:58.887 --> 19:01.306
is the proper form
for airing his grievances.

19:01.557 --> 19:04.935
Tell him I'll be very, very disappointed
if that story runs.

19:05.477 --> 19:08.856
Truth is, Frank, I could have had
his badge for incompetency.

19:09.398 --> 19:10.274
But this'll do.

19:15.779 --> 19:17.739
Got a minute
for a broken down old war horse?

19:18.073 --> 19:20.492
-Stan.
-Hiya, Captain.

19:20.742 --> 19:22.494
-You look great.
-That's the way I feel.

19:23.412 --> 19:24.621
Life of leisure agrees with you.

19:24.705 --> 19:26.081
No, no, no, no. That's not it.

19:26.165 --> 19:29.543
It's this-this thing I had, this bypass.
I feel 20 years younger.

19:29.626 --> 19:31.837
-They say it's a miracle operation.
-You should have seen me.

19:31.920 --> 19:34.298
Up at my cabin,
I was rowing out to my fishing spot.

19:34.590 --> 19:36.633
I was even chopping wood.
Can you believe that?

19:36.717 --> 19:38.302
-I'm glad.
-I mean it.

19:39.761 --> 19:41.180
I mean, I feel like a new man.

19:43.098 --> 19:46.894
So, uh... how's-how's Sergeant Hunter
coming along?

19:47.311 --> 19:49.688
Oh, he's settling in. Mm-hmm.

19:49.938 --> 19:51.982
It's a hell of a thing for him,
that demotion.

19:53.984 --> 19:55.319
He's settling in all right, though, huh?

19:56.945 --> 19:59.740
Listen, now that you're back,
can Joyce and I get you to dinner?

19:59.823 --> 20:00.991
Sure, sure.

20:03.493 --> 20:06.246
-There's no policy against it, Captain.
-Against what, Stan?

20:06.330 --> 20:08.582
As long as my doctor
gives me a clean bill of health,

20:08.665 --> 20:12.044
the department's got no policy
against my coming back on the force.

20:12.127 --> 20:14.463
-It's a stressful position.
-I can do it.

20:14.546 --> 20:16.340
Hell, I could do it better than before.

20:16.423 --> 20:20.219
I'd-I'd be like a 35-year-old
with 25 years' experience.

20:20.302 --> 20:23.138
-You're 16 months from mandatory.
-Don't be automatic.

20:26.058 --> 20:27.726
Don't shut me down
without thinking about it.

20:30.103 --> 20:32.522
-Please.
-If I call your doctor, he'll back you?

20:32.606 --> 20:35.859
I-I swear to you, he'll give me
100 percent clean bill of health.

20:36.777 --> 20:38.111
-Okay.
-You mean that, Captain?

20:38.195 --> 20:40.739
-Okay, I'll think about it.
-Sure, sure. I understand.

20:40.822 --> 20:42.824
Look, here's, uh, here's my doc's name.

20:44.159 --> 20:47.162
Captain, thanks.

20:49.248 --> 20:52.584
-No promises.
-No promises. Right, no promises.

20:53.293 --> 20:54.920
You know, I'm sorry all the guys
are out on the shift.

20:55.254 --> 20:57.005
Why don't you stop
and say hello to Howard?

20:57.089 --> 21:00.634
Yeah, I'll... I'll do that
if he's at the desk.

21:01.426 --> 21:03.804
-When would I hear from you?
-I don't know.

21:05.347 --> 21:06.181
Soon.

21:08.392 --> 21:09.226
Thanks, Captain.

21:11.812 --> 21:12.980
(door closes)

21:17.359 --> 21:18.652
WAITRESS: Can I help you, sir?

21:19.611 --> 21:22.948
So, uh, what do you guys think
of this new kid Lane the Bombers got?

21:23.031 --> 21:24.449
Kid's got some pretty good moves, huh?

21:24.533 --> 21:26.451
Yeah, he's a hell
of a broken field runner.

21:26.535 --> 21:28.745
Boys sure can run, can't they?

21:31.581 --> 21:34.167
That's him. That's Mike.
That's the guy that was working on my car.

21:35.168 --> 21:37.879
Probably just wants
your spare set of keys.

21:37.963 --> 21:39.506
Ha, ha, ha.

21:40.090 --> 21:40.924
(chuckles)

21:42.009 --> 21:42.843
Thank you.

21:54.313 --> 21:56.565
MA: Uh, burger, fries, Coke.

21:56.648 --> 21:58.150
And we need some more ketchup.

22:00.068 --> 22:03.322
So sorry about your bad luck.
Getting your car stole.

22:03.405 --> 22:06.950
Uh, now before you go any further, Mike,

22:07.242 --> 22:09.786
let me point out to you
that I am an officer of the law.

22:09.870 --> 22:12.873
Who is about to get
full Blue Book replacement

22:12.956 --> 22:16.084
for a car that needed 3,500 bodywork.

22:16.168 --> 22:17.711
Look, I don't want to talk to you
about this, okay?

22:17.794 --> 22:20.964
As far as I'm concerned, the theft
of my vehicle has nothing to do with you.

22:21.048 --> 22:23.300
-We had a conversation last week.
-It was a coincidence.

22:23.383 --> 22:25.260
I put a fix in to your claims guy.

22:25.344 --> 22:28.096
-Everything else--
-(humming)

22:30.599 --> 22:33.477
You can hum all you want to, guy,
but you are in this.

22:33.977 --> 22:35.562
Your Blue Book is six grand.

22:35.812 --> 22:38.899
I cash the settlement check,
I take 20 percent.

22:44.154 --> 22:44.988
Forget the food.

22:45.072 --> 22:47.824
Andy, you got a call at the station
from an insurance adjuster.

22:47.908 --> 22:49.993
-Khaki officer has got the number.
-Thank you.

22:53.538 --> 22:54.373
What's the matter?

22:55.457 --> 22:58.001
Oh, the most horrible things go on.

22:59.378 --> 23:03.590
-What do you mean?
-Well, this poor man was down in the alley

23:03.673 --> 23:08.261
and those gang kids
were on him like wolves.

23:08.345 --> 23:12.516
-Like, like scavenging birds.
-This is near your hotel?

23:15.477 --> 23:16.311
So how are you?

23:17.354 --> 23:19.398
(chuckles) Okay.

23:19.981 --> 23:21.024
Little worried about my buddy.

23:21.733 --> 23:24.444
I-I keep having this dream.

23:24.653 --> 23:28.240
I'm camped outside a walled city.
I keep trying to get in.

23:29.741 --> 23:31.701
I just think maybe I should go home.

23:33.453 --> 23:34.579
No luck with the other publishers?

23:34.913 --> 23:37.040
Oh, it's like a broken record.

23:37.874 --> 23:40.335
Six to 7:00, I try to call the presidents

23:40.419 --> 23:42.337
of publishing houses
before they get the trains.

23:43.213 --> 23:45.340
Then Rice Krispies and grapes.

23:45.424 --> 23:47.426
Then I catch the subway.

23:47.634 --> 23:50.470
Nine to 11:00,
I try to get an editor to see me.

23:50.554 --> 23:52.347
And then back here and get jostled.

23:53.974 --> 23:56.268
Henry, you just wouldn't believe it.

23:57.644 --> 24:01.481
These kids are like mangling jackals.

24:08.572 --> 24:09.865
(sighs) Tell me the truth.

24:11.199 --> 24:12.242
Did you really like my novel?

24:13.201 --> 24:14.035
I did.

24:17.414 --> 24:19.207
There's a whole lot of good stuff in it.

24:19.958 --> 24:20.792
A whole lot.

24:26.298 --> 24:29.301
Come on, against the bar.
Everybody up against the bar.

24:29.384 --> 24:31.219
Spread 'em. Spread 'em wide.

24:31.303 --> 24:34.973
That means you, too, horse face.
You want a special invitation? Come on.

24:35.182 --> 24:36.266
Get up against the bar.

24:38.435 --> 24:39.269
-All right, what do they got?
-LUCY: Spread out.

24:39.352 --> 24:41.605
NORMAN: Come on, let's see
what the ladies got in their pockets.

24:41.688 --> 24:42.939
Let's help the policemen.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.193
MAN: Hey, you know
people are trying to make a living here?

24:46.276 --> 24:48.862
Have you got a warrant
or something, Officer?

24:48.945 --> 24:50.071
-Have I got a warrant?
-Yeah.

24:50.155 --> 24:53.909
(chuckles) Have you got a felony offender
with an ongoing parole problem

24:53.992 --> 24:55.619
frequenting this establishment?

24:55.952 --> 24:58.455
Why you just save the roust
and tell me who it is?

24:58.538 --> 25:00.582
Well, look what just crawled out
of the can.

25:00.665 --> 25:01.666
Hey, Lieutenant.

25:02.584 --> 25:05.128
Thanks for costing me my meatpacking job.

25:05.212 --> 25:07.589
I show up from the dentist
to find out you had me fired.

25:07.672 --> 25:10.967
What, had you fired, Ace?
We inquired for your whereabouts.

25:11.051 --> 25:13.303
-You 86'd me, man.
-Come on, Ace.

25:13.386 --> 25:15.472
-One more step.
-What's the freakin' shot?

25:16.014 --> 25:17.682
-Sid.
-That little twitch?

25:18.058 --> 25:20.143
That little twitch
is stinking up my apartment

25:20.227 --> 25:22.354
and keeping me awake all night
yapping in his sleep

25:22.437 --> 25:23.813
'cause he thinks you're gonna ice him.

25:23.897 --> 25:25.482
I don't want him in my apartment, Ace.

25:25.565 --> 25:27.817
So you get me fired from my job?

25:27.901 --> 25:29.986
Hey, hey, your job
is breaking into places.

25:30.070 --> 25:33.823
This, uh, meatpacking gig
is just a jolly for your parole officer.

25:33.907 --> 25:35.909
Now, Ace, flamingos,

25:35.992 --> 25:39.037
jai alai, Gulfstream park.
You see a pattern here, huh?

25:39.120 --> 25:41.039
I think the man is describing Florida.

25:41.122 --> 25:44.459
Buy a ticket, Ace. 'Cause as long
as you're around here

25:44.543 --> 25:46.711
you are a definite minus
to every establishment

25:46.795 --> 25:48.046
that gives you hospitality.

25:48.129 --> 25:50.799
You got limburger all over your forehead.

25:53.843 --> 25:54.928
Safe trip.

25:57.681 --> 26:00.308
That little jerk better hope
you keep running interference for him.

26:00.392 --> 26:02.978
Forget about him, Ace.
Eliminate him from your mind.

26:14.364 --> 26:15.198
Look out. Look out.

26:17.576 --> 26:18.743
It's a new kind of high.

26:19.327 --> 26:20.704
They call it running the table.

26:21.997 --> 26:23.957
Why didn't I read about this
in the manual?

26:24.416 --> 26:25.792
It's there, Flaherty.

26:25.875 --> 26:28.044
Chapter's called loyalty
to someone you work with.

26:28.128 --> 26:29.713
They must have left it out of your copy.

26:29.796 --> 26:31.631
Oh, yeah.
You as tough as you think, Lieutenant?

26:31.715 --> 26:34.342
-Hey, how about let's find out, huh?
-Hey, stop it!

26:34.759 --> 26:35.927
Stop it right now.

26:48.481 --> 26:49.816
Captain Furillo, Antonio Robledo.

26:49.899 --> 26:51.359
-How do you do, sir?
-Please, sit down.

26:51.443 --> 26:52.277
Thank you.

26:53.486 --> 26:54.946
Send in Luiz Limon, please.

26:55.864 --> 26:58.742
I just spent 20 minutes on the telephone
with Mr. Limon.

26:58.825 --> 27:00.619
I'd hoped this could be
a private conversation.

27:00.702 --> 27:02.245
That's not how I run my newspaper.

27:02.996 --> 27:04.998
Now this is Captain Furillo
from the Hill Street precinct.

27:05.081 --> 27:05.915
How are you?

27:06.333 --> 27:09.336
I was just entering Captain Furillo's
no comments in my word processor.

27:09.419 --> 27:11.796
I hope you don't think
you have a news story here.

27:11.880 --> 27:15.342
What you've done is strung together
a series of inaccurate speculations

27:15.425 --> 27:17.260
by a man who's emotionally distraught.

27:17.344 --> 27:19.220
So you deny
Captain Calletano's statements?

27:19.304 --> 27:21.640
-I have no comment.
-ANTONIO: If you'll permit me, Captain.

27:21.723 --> 27:24.726
If you had your captaincy taken away,
wouldn't you be emotionally distraught?

27:24.809 --> 27:27.520
Yes, and maybe I'd be tempted
to say some things I didn't mean

27:27.604 --> 27:29.314
or-or hadn't thought all the way through.

27:29.397 --> 27:31.358
You are an interested party here, Captain.

27:31.691 --> 27:34.402
Is was your panel that removed
Captain Calletano from his command.

27:34.486 --> 27:37.364
My self-interest
is to see that my department

27:37.447 --> 27:39.157
doesn't split apart along racial lines,

27:39.240 --> 27:41.576
but I also happen to be
Ray Calletano's friend.

27:41.660 --> 27:44.579
I'd hate to see him victimized
by one moment of poor judgement.

27:44.663 --> 27:47.248
Captain Calletano
said he didn't show poor judgement.

27:47.332 --> 27:49.793
He said the racial tensions
in his precinct weren't his fault.

27:49.876 --> 27:51.586
That's not the bad judgement
I'm talking about.

27:51.670 --> 27:54.047
Captain Calletano's precinct
had gone renegade.

27:54.130 --> 27:55.423
It needed to be brought under control.

27:55.507 --> 27:58.134
That would have been true if I'd been
captain or if Stan Williams had.

27:58.218 --> 28:00.136
You feel
Captain Calletano's poor judgement

28:00.220 --> 28:02.514
is using the press as a forum
to express his grievance?

28:02.597 --> 28:04.432
-Yes.
-And I publish a newspaper

28:04.516 --> 28:06.017
to provide such a forum.

28:06.101 --> 28:08.186
I credit your good intentions, Captain.

28:08.269 --> 28:11.314
But I don't choose to decide
what is best for Señor Calletano.

28:11.398 --> 28:13.441
-It'll mean his badge.
-Maybe he wants to do other work.

28:13.525 --> 28:15.694
-Maybe this will get you a promotion.
-Maybe.

28:17.195 --> 28:18.780
-Thanks for your time.
-Captain.

28:27.122 --> 28:29.541
Andrew, you have a gentleman caller.

28:30.458 --> 28:33.878
An insurance guy.
Um, Sarge, what did he say?

28:33.962 --> 28:35.547
(stammers) What did he say to you?

28:36.339 --> 28:39.384
He said, "Is Officer Renko here?"
Then he said, "I'll wait."

28:40.468 --> 28:42.429
Transit authority request assist.

28:42.512 --> 28:45.140
Uh, Robert, will you and Officer Sanders
take that call?

28:48.476 --> 28:49.811
That was not a question.

28:53.440 --> 28:55.734
Bobby Hill,
I'm starting to see myself in stripes.

28:55.817 --> 28:57.235
I don't know what I'm gonna say
to this insurance guy.

28:57.318 --> 29:01.906
I would just keep it to yes, no's
and a whole lot of I don't remember.

29:05.952 --> 29:09.831
Uh, Andrew J. Renko, sir.
I understand you're looking for me.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.792
Harold Sturkle, Officer.
Perennial Casualty.

29:12.876 --> 29:15.170
-Nice to see you.
-Glad I caught you.

29:15.795 --> 29:17.630
What? Caught me?

29:17.714 --> 29:20.300
I mean, I'm glad I caught you
here at the precinct.

29:20.508 --> 29:22.635
I was in the neighborhood and had some
routine questions

29:22.719 --> 29:25.972
-about your theft this morning.
-What do you mean, theft? By theft?

29:27.682 --> 29:29.392
I meant the theft of your car.

29:31.352 --> 29:34.272
Uh, car was parked outside your residence?

29:34.355 --> 29:36.274
Yes, sir.
I live in the 1400 block of Carlyle.

29:36.357 --> 29:38.359
I like to keep my car
parked right out in front

29:38.443 --> 29:39.903
where I can see it all the time.

29:41.196 --> 29:43.072
And the vehicle was locked?

29:43.323 --> 29:45.074
Yes, sir.
As a police officer, I'm well aware

29:45.158 --> 29:48.411
of the precautions one can take to keep
a travesty like this from happening,

29:48.495 --> 29:50.830
but nevertheless,
the thieves did break in.

29:50.914 --> 29:51.748
Uh-huh.

29:52.707 --> 29:55.335
-When did you notice the car was missing?
-What?

29:57.212 --> 29:59.756
When did you notice the car was missing?

30:00.632 --> 30:01.549
Whenever I got up.

30:01.841 --> 30:04.302
What time was that, Officer?

30:04.385 --> 30:07.722
Five-forty-five, 6:00. Whenever I got up.

30:09.265 --> 30:10.099
If you'll sign here.

30:11.267 --> 30:13.353
I'll have the check cut
by the end of business.

30:14.354 --> 30:16.564
Somewhere I can give it
to you this evening?

30:17.690 --> 30:19.818
Malory's, 98th and Dekker.

30:20.527 --> 30:21.694
See you at 8:00.

30:22.111 --> 30:24.531
Yes, I'll see you there at 8:00.
(chuckles nervously)

30:30.537 --> 30:31.371
Gentlemen.

30:32.121 --> 30:34.624
Something I can do for you,
your swamiship?

30:34.707 --> 30:36.167
You want to report a stolen camel?

30:36.251 --> 30:37.836
Very funny, guys.

30:37.919 --> 30:41.047
Listen, is Lieutenant Buntz really out
or is he just ignoring my calls?

30:41.548 --> 30:43.508
Wait a minute. Sid?

30:44.217 --> 30:46.094
Shh. Yes, Sid.

30:46.678 --> 30:48.930
Also known as a person in grave danger.

30:49.013 --> 30:50.348
Hey, lieutenant ain't here, Sid.

30:50.431 --> 30:53.476
Oh, man, listen,
could one of you guys let me hold a 20?

30:53.810 --> 30:54.686
What do you got?

30:55.061 --> 30:58.064
What I got in terms
of information is <i>nada.</i>

30:58.147 --> 31:00.817
What I really got is Lieutenant Buntz
is letting me stay at his place

31:00.900 --> 31:03.444
until this heat wave
I'm involved in blows over.

31:03.528 --> 31:05.488
And I would like to cook him
a decent meal.

31:05.572 --> 31:07.949
Unfortunately, I cannot circulate,

31:08.032 --> 31:11.327
therefore I cannot ply my trade,
therefore I'm tapped out.

31:11.870 --> 31:13.913
Effects on your
massage parlor pop, Detective.

31:13.997 --> 31:17.292
Ah, thanks, Doris.
Sounds like a vicious circle, Sid.

31:17.375 --> 31:19.085
Good luck raising the Jackson.

31:19.168 --> 31:20.920
You know what you guys are doing,
don't you?

31:21.004 --> 31:23.131
You are driving me to shoplift.

31:23.756 --> 31:25.508
(speaks foreign language)

31:26.217 --> 31:28.303
Ask him yourself, Jack.

31:32.807 --> 31:34.392
Okay, you guys can go.

31:35.268 --> 31:37.270
Uh, will there be any record of this?

31:37.353 --> 31:39.647
No record. Good luck with your back.

31:39.731 --> 31:41.816
J.D.: Mr. Bernstein,
we're in sort of a delicate area here.

31:41.900 --> 31:43.276
I wanted to get your advice.

31:43.943 --> 31:45.445
One of our cops had a little accident

31:45.528 --> 31:48.156
at this massage parlor bust,
Mr. Bernstein.

31:50.700 --> 31:52.118
Do you follow what I'm saying?

31:54.704 --> 31:55.538
No.

31:56.456 --> 31:57.457
An accident.

31:58.207 --> 31:59.042
Down there.

32:01.669 --> 32:02.921
Number one or number two?

32:04.047 --> 32:07.383
When he was in the room with the girl,
the guy got a little excited.

32:07.926 --> 32:10.386
If you're saying
he consummated the sexual act,

32:10.470 --> 32:12.305
Detective, the arrest is defective.

32:12.388 --> 32:13.723
Now, he didn't consummate it.

32:14.515 --> 32:18.019
The guy had his party
before anyone else arrived.

32:22.732 --> 32:25.735
-Kick it.
-Just his bust or the whole operation?

32:26.277 --> 32:28.154
The other busts
are technically salvageable,

32:28.237 --> 32:30.907
but be a pretty embarrassing prosecution.

32:30.990 --> 32:33.242
-Okay, thanks.
-Has this gentleman thought about

32:33.326 --> 32:34.661
getting into other areas of police work?

32:35.578 --> 32:36.913
Yeah, right.

32:37.288 --> 32:38.122
Hey.

32:40.124 --> 32:42.085
-How you doing?
-We get them booked?

32:42.502 --> 32:44.253
What are your charges
on your arrest, Detective?

32:44.337 --> 32:47.256
Just talking about that.
Hold off on that a second.

32:48.216 --> 32:51.469
Just talked to this ADA
who thinks maybe we ought to take

32:51.552 --> 32:53.638
a Pasadena on these busts.

32:53.721 --> 32:54.597
Because of me.

32:55.348 --> 32:57.058
Hey, everybody's got an off day.

32:57.433 --> 32:59.227
Maybe you had too many oysters last night.

33:01.646 --> 33:03.523
Not that it's any of my business,

33:03.982 --> 33:06.567
but doesn't working vice
kind of put you on the spot?

33:06.651 --> 33:07.944
I'm up for promotion.

33:08.361 --> 33:09.904
I'm up to be put in charge.

33:10.363 --> 33:12.824
-Any day I get behind a desk.
-Statistics help?

33:13.992 --> 33:15.576
-What do you mean?
-I mean...

33:15.660 --> 33:17.286
you know, at the crucial moment,

33:17.370 --> 33:19.497
you start thinking
about baseball averages.

33:19.580 --> 33:21.374
Try reversing your street address.

33:21.457 --> 33:23.626
No, I think of capitals
of foreign countries.

33:24.252 --> 33:25.378
-NG?
-NG.

33:25.461 --> 33:27.255
Are we popping those hookers or not?

33:28.339 --> 33:29.173
Not.

33:32.176 --> 33:33.011
Hey.

33:33.928 --> 33:36.014
You, uh, you open for a suggestion?

33:36.097 --> 33:38.016
-Anything.
-Call her.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.518
-Sonya?
-Cousin of mine,

33:41.269 --> 33:43.062
went to her with a similar problem.

33:43.646 --> 33:46.357
She, uh, makes you talk baby talk.

33:46.566 --> 33:47.400
But she helps.

33:50.987 --> 33:52.697
So how long you been on the force?

33:54.824 --> 33:55.867
Twelve years.

33:57.201 --> 33:58.244
How about yourself?

33:58.786 --> 34:00.663
-Eleven.
-Hmm.

34:00.747 --> 34:02.874
Must have just missed each other
at the academy.

34:04.042 --> 34:05.918
Did you have Hoover for weapons training?

34:06.627 --> 34:09.130
-Major Two Statement.
-The worst.

34:09.714 --> 34:11.591
-"Don't shoot your foot off."
-"Don't shoot your foot off."

34:11.674 --> 34:12.842
-That's him.
-WOMAN (over radio): <i>Unit 2202,</i>

34:12.925 --> 34:15.511
<i>your 516 call now has shots fired.</i>

34:15.595 --> 34:17.847
<i>Your 516 is now an all units.</i>

34:21.434 --> 34:22.518
Must be in the subway.

34:30.151 --> 34:31.527
It's been a while, right.

34:31.944 --> 34:34.447
Uh, actually, that's what
I'm calling about, Sonya.

34:34.530 --> 34:36.532
I gave this guy your number.

34:37.366 --> 34:39.744
Hey, don't mention it.
I'm glad to get you the action.

34:40.203 --> 34:42.747
Uh, one thing, if it comes up,

34:43.456 --> 34:45.333
I told him you helped my cousin.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.377
Great. I appreciate it.

34:48.711 --> 34:51.005
Oh, got to go, Sonya.

34:52.548 --> 34:55.551
Huh? No. No, no recurrence.

34:59.305 --> 35:01.432
Same goes for baby Johnny.

35:02.225 --> 35:04.644
Baby Johnny misses you, too.

35:07.772 --> 35:08.606
Lieutenant.

35:09.482 --> 35:11.567
We're getting more particulars
on this subway incident.

35:11.651 --> 35:13.653
I'm afraid it involves
that friend of yours.

35:14.237 --> 35:15.905
Steve Merkur? What happened?

35:15.988 --> 35:17.824
Shot three youths, two fatalities.

35:17.907 --> 35:20.076
The officers have him pinned down
in the brakeman's car.

35:20.159 --> 35:21.994
He's been asking to speak with you.

35:24.372 --> 35:26.541
WOMAN (on radio):
<i>2008, get off this frequency.</i>

35:26.624 --> 35:28.709
<i>All units,</i>
<i>please stay off frequency three.</i>

35:28.793 --> 35:31.045
<i>Frequency three is clear</i>
<i>for Detective Goldblume.</i>

35:32.213 --> 35:34.423
-Anything?
<i>-Nobody's moving, Lieutenant.</i>

35:35.424 --> 35:38.052
Tell them to back away, keep him calm.
I'm six blocks away.

35:38.302 --> 35:39.137
<i>Copy, Lieutenant.</i>

35:40.763 --> 35:43.558
<i>All units at the original 516 call,</i>

35:43.641 --> 35:46.185
<i>Dekker and 117th Street subway station.</i>

35:46.811 --> 35:49.355
<i>Lieutenant Goldblume's ETA is 30 seconds.</i>

35:49.981 --> 35:51.649
<i>Take no decisive action.</i>

36:16.382 --> 36:18.634
Come on. Come on!

36:18.718 --> 36:20.761
RADIO:
<i>We have a shots fired report, Lieutenant.</i>

36:20.845 --> 36:21.679
What's happening?

36:22.638 --> 36:25.141
What the hell is going on? Tell me!

36:25.641 --> 36:28.019
<i>-Shots fired. Officer down.</i>
-Oh, God.

36:28.311 --> 36:30.855
<i>We now have an officer down</i>
<i>and suspect down, Lieutenant.</i>

36:37.945 --> 36:38.905
(people chattering)

36:38.988 --> 36:40.740
Get out of the way. Get out of the way!

36:42.533 --> 36:44.619
-What happened?
-The guy just started shooting.

36:44.827 --> 36:46.287
I don't think he knew what hit him.

36:46.370 --> 36:48.831
Hey, look, I'm fine.
See what you can do for him.

36:48.915 --> 36:50.875
-Who is it?
-BOBBY: Sanders.

36:50.958 --> 36:52.168
He was riding with me.

36:53.252 --> 36:55.755
-What happened down there?
-Guy freaked out, Lieutenant.

36:56.088 --> 36:58.341
He came out babbling
about some pages or something

36:58.424 --> 36:59.842
and just started blasting.

37:00.134 --> 37:01.844
He was protecting himself
against those punks.

37:01.928 --> 37:03.179
The man shouldn't have been shot.

37:03.262 --> 37:04.430
Yeah, he was protecting all of us.

37:04.513 --> 37:06.599
-You cops killed a hero.
-Why did he start shooting?

37:06.682 --> 37:08.226
We just asked the dude for some change.

37:08.309 --> 37:11.687
You got what you deserved, you bastard!
You and your dead friends.

37:11.771 --> 37:13.940
Celeste Baldwin from Channel Six.
I don't know if you remember me.

37:14.023 --> 37:16.442
We have a report saying
that the shooter was asking for you

37:16.525 --> 37:17.735
right before he was killed.

37:17.818 --> 37:18.653
He was my friend.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.363
Did you know he was
carrying a gun, Lieutenant?

37:20.446 --> 37:22.573
The people on the subway
claim he was defending himself

37:22.657 --> 37:23.991
against would-be attackers.

37:24.075 --> 37:26.661
How long has he been playing
would-be vigilante?

37:26.744 --> 37:27.954
Come on! Stop it!

37:29.455 --> 37:31.249
Stop making up your own stories.

37:36.170 --> 37:37.046
Excuse me.

37:57.525 --> 37:58.985
Unit three needs service.

37:59.068 --> 38:01.445
-Specifics, Sarge?
-Everything. Brakes.

38:03.072 --> 38:05.741
Patrick, we got to do something
about your problem, you and Buntz.

38:05.825 --> 38:08.452
-Sounds right.
-Yeah. I don't mean a fistfight.

38:08.536 --> 38:12.081
Look, Sarge, everywhere I go
there's gonna be people

38:12.164 --> 38:14.625
who can't handle
that I turned my partner in.

38:15.584 --> 38:17.169
I can't let that be my problem.

38:17.253 --> 38:19.297
So what's your problem?
You and your squad lieutenant

38:19.380 --> 38:20.923
can't be in the same room
without throwing rights?

38:23.009 --> 38:25.428
Talk to him. There's got to be more to it.

38:31.350 --> 38:32.810
He lists two sisters, Captain,

38:32.893 --> 38:35.438
but I don't know which would be called
Sanders' next of kin.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.439
I'll just call them both.

38:36.522 --> 38:39.442
Officer Hill
has a superficial bicep wound that--

38:39.525 --> 38:41.068
Uh, he already should be released.

38:41.819 --> 38:44.739
Um, I have had a raft of inquires

38:44.822 --> 38:48.326
about Lieutenant Goldblume's connection
with this unfortunate Merkur fellow

38:48.409 --> 38:49.952
from the vultures in the press.

38:50.036 --> 38:51.120
Just take their numbers, Howard.

38:54.373 --> 38:56.959
I hope I was permitted
a disapproving tone.

38:58.669 --> 39:00.338
-Captain.
-Howard.

39:03.090 --> 39:03.924
Ray.

39:04.925 --> 39:08.012
The newspaper story will not appear
in the Spanish press, Frank.

39:08.471 --> 39:10.139
I requested them not to publish.

39:10.222 --> 39:12.308
I know how painful this had been for you.

39:13.267 --> 39:14.310
I think you're showing good judgement.

39:14.393 --> 39:16.687
For the story to appear,
it would have meant my job.

39:17.313 --> 39:18.147
Don't you agree?

39:19.065 --> 39:21.192
So now I am Chief Daniels' advisor.

39:21.734 --> 39:23.027
I have my job.

39:24.320 --> 39:26.530
And all I lost is my self-respect.

39:36.165 --> 39:39.919
(clears throat) Yeah, person to person
to Ms. Eugenie Sanders.

39:43.130 --> 39:45.591
It's none of my business,
I just wanted to say though

39:45.674 --> 39:48.469
that you shouldn't let
all the talking upset you.

39:48.886 --> 39:50.096
You mean how I'm a tramp?

39:51.764 --> 39:53.766
I slept with Sonny Cappelito
on my undercover.

39:53.849 --> 39:55.810
People take things out of context.

39:55.893 --> 39:59.105
They look for easy ways
to think about other people.

40:00.106 --> 40:02.817
Everyone used to call me Belker the Biter.

40:02.900 --> 40:03.734
Ha, ha.

40:05.444 --> 40:06.695
Just keep doing the job.

40:09.031 --> 40:09.865
Good night.

40:10.991 --> 40:11.826
Good night.

40:18.833 --> 40:19.667
PATRICK: Lieutenant Buntz?

40:27.591 --> 40:29.510
-What do you need?
-Ranks?

40:32.304 --> 40:34.932
-Why you on me so bad?
-You don't got to ask me that.

40:35.599 --> 40:37.226
Oh, 'cause I turned in Andy Schuler?

40:37.309 --> 40:38.936
Let me tell you something, Flaherty.

40:39.353 --> 40:40.646
If you're lucky, in your life

40:40.729 --> 40:42.606
maybe there's three or four people
you're friends with.

40:42.690 --> 40:45.401
Now, I just don't dig somebody
that'd give up his partner.

40:45.484 --> 40:46.902
-Did you know Andy Schuler?
-Hey.

40:46.986 --> 40:48.320
Huh, do you know what he was like?

40:48.404 --> 40:50.906
Hey, I don't care
how crooked this Schuler was.

40:50.990 --> 40:53.534
I rolled with a guy,
could have given him cards in spades.

40:53.617 --> 40:56.370
I'm saying how do you know I was even
friends with him, Lieutenant, huh?

40:56.454 --> 40:58.581
How do you know if he was even a nice guy?

41:00.458 --> 41:02.918
Look, I hear you had a partner you shot.

41:03.002 --> 41:05.671
-Is there somehow this figures in?
-You shut up!

41:05.754 --> 41:08.340
You keep your freakin' mouth shut!
Come on, you want to go, huh?

41:08.424 --> 41:10.050
-Huh?
-Would you let go of me?

41:17.850 --> 41:21.061
Don't you let me hear Tommy Donahue
out of your lips, kid.

41:32.364 --> 41:35.075
Tommy Donahue
was the sweetest guy you'd ever meet.

41:37.077 --> 41:38.204
And the nicest.

41:39.330 --> 41:40.873
Before he got all screwed up.

41:43.834 --> 41:45.503
Had the most guts, too.

41:47.171 --> 41:48.714
Kid took a bullet for me.

41:51.967 --> 41:54.261
Showed up at a pop
he wasn't even supposed...

42:01.352 --> 42:03.062
It was easier for me, Lieutenant.

42:05.981 --> 42:07.608
I didn't love Andy Schuler.

42:16.033 --> 42:16.951
RENKO: Well, there you are.

42:17.034 --> 42:18.827
(woman on TV indistinct)

42:21.121 --> 42:22.456
And there's Sanders.

42:26.168 --> 42:27.419
You think he got bum rapped?

42:27.503 --> 42:29.338
What do you mean?
About being racist and all?

42:29.421 --> 42:31.632
-Yeah.
-No, I don't think--

42:32.466 --> 42:35.010
I don't think you know what's in a guy's
heart till you get to know him.

42:36.554 --> 42:37.972
We ain't gonna know Sanders.

42:40.766 --> 42:44.436
Oh, Bobby, there's that insurance guy.
He's got that guy Mike with him.

42:51.110 --> 42:52.444
Don't make me bust you.

42:53.028 --> 42:56.824
Oh, come on. Don't jive me, man.
I'm on the verge of insurance crucifixion.

43:00.953 --> 43:02.454
Mr. Sturkle. How you doing, Mike?

43:03.247 --> 43:06.125
Officer. Step into my office.

43:07.293 --> 43:10.588
I, uh...
I have your settlement check here.

43:11.130 --> 43:12.673
$6,000.

43:13.757 --> 43:16.302
If you'll sign it, then for a slight fee,

43:16.385 --> 43:19.346
my friend can cash it
and we can all go home for supper.

43:20.222 --> 43:21.515
Well, yes and no.

43:22.766 --> 43:23.601
Yes and no what?

43:23.684 --> 43:26.604
Well, yeah,
I want the check 'cause my car got stolen.

43:26.687 --> 43:29.315
No, I'm not gonna avail myself
of your check cashing service.

43:30.149 --> 43:30.983
What'd I tell you?

43:31.609 --> 43:34.069
-Uh, you don't get it, Officer.
-No, you don't get it.

43:35.529 --> 43:37.281
See, I'm not gonna be party to a felony

43:37.531 --> 43:39.783
'cause this guy here
mistook an innocent conversation.

43:39.867 --> 43:43.120
So, what I suggest is you both go home
to those hot meals you were talking about

43:43.203 --> 43:44.913
before you get charged
with insurance fraud,

43:44.997 --> 43:47.374
or grand auto theft,
or I don't know what all.

43:48.667 --> 43:51.170
Cops think they can get away with murder.

43:52.421 --> 43:53.422
Check, please.

43:58.427 --> 43:59.928
<i>Via con dios,</i> Mike.

44:32.169 --> 44:34.338
-MAN: Night manager.
-(knocks)

44:36.465 --> 44:39.134
-About done in here?
-Why?

44:39.218 --> 44:40.886
I was told the room would be vacated.

44:45.265 --> 44:46.350
I'll be a few more minutes.

44:58.070 --> 44:58.904
For him.

45:00.155 --> 45:00.989
For him.

45:02.491 --> 45:04.243
(sighs)

45:05.869 --> 45:06.704
(clears throat)

45:10.624 --> 45:12.668
(sighs, sniffles)

45:14.545 --> 45:15.379
What?

45:16.213 --> 45:17.297
You say grace, Norm?

45:18.132 --> 45:19.508
Are you kidding me?

45:19.758 --> 45:21.510
I'm in Rome, I don't know.

45:25.806 --> 45:28.934
-That's good, huh?
-Mm. It's good.

45:29.309 --> 45:32.229
-Where'd you get the vino?
-A nice chianti, huh?

45:32.312 --> 45:33.647
I stole it at Sully's.

45:33.731 --> 45:35.357
-Hey.
-Sorry.

45:41.739 --> 45:43.365
Did I talk as much last night?

45:43.449 --> 45:44.491
(chuckles) Worse.

45:44.575 --> 45:46.034
Oh, jeez.

45:46.744 --> 45:48.871
I don't know
what I'm gonna do about that, Norm.

45:49.413 --> 45:50.330
I am not gonna impose.

45:51.498 --> 45:52.875
You're not gonna impose?

45:53.792 --> 45:56.044
No. I'm not gonna ask you
to switch beds with me.

45:56.128 --> 45:57.504
Let me sleep in a more comfortable bed.

45:58.005 --> 45:59.423
Good, Sid. Don't ask.

45:59.506 --> 46:01.258
No, 'cause that would be an imposition.

46:01.884 --> 46:03.635
And I'm a guest. I'm lucky to be a guest.

46:06.138 --> 46:08.974
Anyway, I think maybe your Ace Shanks
problem is about to ease off.

46:09.057 --> 46:11.518
-Oh, yeah?
-I think Ace is about to migrate.

46:11.894 --> 46:14.855
Well, Ace Shanks
is not a seasonal creature.

46:14.938 --> 46:17.024
Hey, Sid, let me know
what I know, all right?

46:17.107 --> 46:18.400
You handle being a creep.

46:19.610 --> 46:20.444
(thuds)

46:21.153 --> 46:22.529
No!

46:22.613 --> 46:25.073
(gunshots)

46:33.957 --> 46:35.876
Sid. Sid.

46:35.959 --> 46:37.336
Sid, come here.

46:38.170 --> 46:39.129
-Ow.
-Sid, are you hit?

46:39.213 --> 46:41.465
No, I think I knocked myself unconscious.

46:42.549 --> 46:45.260
-That's Ace Shanks, huh?
-It used to be.

46:45.803 --> 46:48.472
-Okay, you're okay, huh?
-Yeah, thanks, Norm.

46:48.555 --> 46:51.099
Okay, don't you die, too, all right?

46:51.183 --> 46:54.228
-Just don't you die, too.
-I ain't gonna die.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.271
(groans)

47:06.824 --> 47:07.866
Morning, Bobby Hill.

47:08.575 --> 47:10.536
Boy, I sure appreciate you taking the time

47:10.619 --> 47:12.412
to come out of your way
and pick me up like this.

47:12.496 --> 47:14.122
No problem. No problem.

47:14.206 --> 47:16.750
BOBBY: I just don't understand
why you won't drive yourself.

47:16.959 --> 47:17.793
What?

47:19.711 --> 47:21.088
(laughs)

47:23.841 --> 47:25.759
Did you cash the check, Andrew?

47:25.843 --> 47:27.761
(laughs)

47:30.556 --> 47:33.684
You know, there are those cops,
Bobby Hill,

47:34.351 --> 47:36.311
who would have given those boys 20 percent

47:36.395 --> 47:39.648
and had $4,800 in cold cash
in their pockets.

47:39.731 --> 47:43.944
Yeah, yeah, but they wouldn't have
this beautiful Chevy to drive to work.

47:44.736 --> 47:47.281
-(laughs)
-Two to one it don't start.

47:47.489 --> 47:50.492
Think positive. Positive.

47:51.577 --> 47:53.954
(engine sputters)

48:00.669 --> 48:03.672
(closing theme playing)
