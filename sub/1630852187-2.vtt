WEBVTT

00:22.160 --> 00:23.320
Put it down.

01:01.520 --> 01:04.480
MONDAY 6:32 PM

01:06.720 --> 01:09.280
HOUR 81 OF THE HEIST

01:10.720 --> 01:13.760
Raquel is looking great.
That's good.

01:15.000 --> 01:17.960
You know,
after a breakup things can be complicated

01:18.040 --> 01:19.640
until both parts get over it.

01:21.400 --> 01:25.120
Yes. I'm glad too.
Raquel really is an extraordinary woman.

01:25.200 --> 01:26.560
Yes, certainly.

01:26.640 --> 01:30.240
If she and our daughter are well,
then we're all good.

01:34.400 --> 01:35.880
Is it hot? I can turn on the AC.

01:36.440 --> 01:40.400
No. The temperature's fine.
It's me, I'm feeling a bit...

01:41.440 --> 01:42.480
a bit rough.

01:42.560 --> 01:44.120
You had coffee from the caterers?

01:44.200 --> 01:45.640
That crap shouldn't be allowed.

01:45.880 --> 01:47.480
I guess I did make that mistake.

01:47.560 --> 01:49.840
I had three cups and besides,
I have this thing.

01:50.600 --> 01:54.000
It's a colon thing. It's nothing serious,
it's this bacteria that...

01:55.520 --> 01:59.960
well, it makes me have to go
to the bathroom more often than usual.

02:02.120 --> 02:05.720
It's a bit embarrassing, but I didn't want
to go number two at the crime scene.

02:08.240 --> 02:09.400
Do you want me to stop?

02:11.160 --> 02:12.560
If you don't mind. Thanks.

02:13.120 --> 02:15.760
It's no problem.
I'll pull into the next gas station.

02:18.480 --> 02:21.040
Actually,
it'd be best if we just pulled over now.

02:21.120 --> 02:22.600
Look, we could stop here.

02:22.680 --> 02:23.680
-There?
-Yes.

02:24.440 --> 02:27.440
-Of course. No problem.
-Thank you.

03:54.920 --> 03:55.760
Salva.

04:03.280 --> 04:04.240
Salva.

04:05.440 --> 04:06.440
Are you alright?

04:07.360 --> 04:08.480
Yes, much better.

04:13.800 --> 04:15.760
You wouldn't believe some people.

04:20.600 --> 04:22.040
I'm ready when you are.

05:40.920 --> 05:42.960
Suarez, come here for a second.

05:45.240 --> 05:46.240
Pilar.

05:48.200 --> 05:50.760
I want you to examine Angel's car.

05:51.040 --> 05:52.840
We already did. It's part of procedure.

05:52.920 --> 05:55.120
And did you find anything unusual?

05:55.560 --> 05:59.120
The brake fluid hoses were clogged, but
that doesn't mean anything.

05:59.200 --> 06:02.120
What do you mean?
It could have been tampered with.

06:02.560 --> 06:04.520
It could be,
but it isn't usually the case.

06:04.800 --> 06:07.160
Brake hoses get clogged, parts break...

06:07.520 --> 06:11.560
It's what happens when a car rolls
over twice at 170 km/h.

06:14.040 --> 06:15.840
-I'm sorry.
-Wait, wait.

06:17.000 --> 06:19.760
Did he say where he got the teaspoon
he gave you?

06:20.320 --> 06:21.400
No, he didn't.

06:22.240 --> 06:23.880
I have to get back to work.

06:25.080 --> 06:27.640
Suarez, when did Angel arrive to Toledo?

06:27.960 --> 06:28.960
Yesterday, right?

06:29.040 --> 06:30.240
Yes. But...

06:30.320 --> 06:32.400
It's possible that he found it here,

06:32.720 --> 06:34.600
that he came to this house before us.

06:35.040 --> 06:36.080
I don't know.

06:36.360 --> 06:39.880
Maybe he took it from the bar
in the village or from the pharmacy.

06:39.960 --> 06:42.520
Maybe he suspected someone
and wanted to make sure...

06:42.600 --> 06:43.440
Raquel!

06:43.560 --> 06:44.440
Take it easy.

06:44.520 --> 06:46.000
That won't help.

06:46.080 --> 06:47.920
Only Angel knows
where he got the spoon.

06:48.000 --> 06:50.760
Angel and the guy
who's helping them from outside.

06:51.120 --> 06:53.840
The same guy who was
listening in on our calls

06:53.960 --> 06:57.280
and tried to kill Angel
by tampering with his car.

06:57.360 --> 06:59.160
She just said there's no proof of that.

06:59.520 --> 07:00.840
Angel had a lead.

07:01.720 --> 07:03.080
And they tried to murder him.

07:03.400 --> 07:05.440
And they'll try again if he ever wakes up.

07:06.960 --> 07:08.240
What are you trying to say?

07:10.400 --> 07:13.240
This time, we're setting the trap.

07:27.920 --> 07:29.720
I was thinking about what you said,

07:29.800 --> 07:32.640
about wanting the best for Raquel.

07:37.640 --> 07:38.480
What?

07:40.720 --> 07:42.760
Well, I don't believe it's true.

07:44.800 --> 07:46.520
If it were, you wouldn't be

07:47.600 --> 07:49.720
fucking her sister.

07:51.320 --> 07:52.920
That's none of your business.

07:53.000 --> 07:54.720
I'm sorry, but I think it is.

07:55.840 --> 07:58.720
When I heard about you I thought:
"this guy must be

07:59.080 --> 08:02.200
head over heels in love
to get himself into a mess like this".

08:02.280 --> 08:06.000
Falling in love and fucking your wife's...

08:06.960 --> 08:08.080
sister.

08:09.480 --> 08:13.520
But when I found out that you were hitting
on your daughter's teacher...

08:15.560 --> 08:17.080
Your daughter's teacher.

08:17.760 --> 08:20.520
Then I understood.
You're one of these guys

08:20.600 --> 08:23.400
who shares his intelligence
with his cock and muscles.

08:23.480 --> 08:26.160
Someone disturbed who has to wear
a social disguise.

08:29.320 --> 08:30.600
The worst is that

08:30.680 --> 08:34.120
Raquel has to see a psychiatrist,
when it should be you.

08:36.640 --> 08:39.800
Of course you won't,
you don't realize how messed up you are.

08:39.880 --> 08:41.120
Motherfucker.

08:41.200 --> 08:43.280
Motherfucker? Me?

08:43.560 --> 08:44.680
Piece of shit.

08:52.760 --> 08:53.920
Get out of the car.

08:55.360 --> 08:56.920
If I get out of the car

08:57.000 --> 08:59.400
I'll beat you so hard,
you won't know what day it is.

09:00.040 --> 09:02.320
Get out of the fucking car!

09:36.440 --> 09:37.800
Do you know what this is?

09:42.320 --> 09:43.680
My meds.

09:45.080 --> 09:46.000
Days to live.

09:48.120 --> 09:49.040
It's unbelievable

09:50.160 --> 09:53.520
how something so valuable
is kept in such a fragile container.

09:54.600 --> 09:55.560
Right?

10:03.720 --> 10:06.840
You haven't taken very well
losing the elections.

10:07.320 --> 10:09.720
You should work on that.

10:11.680 --> 10:13.240
I won't sit around waiting

10:13.600 --> 10:16.200
for them to kill me,
just because we fucking voted on it.

10:17.760 --> 10:18.880
Stay if you want.

10:19.720 --> 10:22.560
But you don't get to decide for us.

10:23.000 --> 10:24.840
That's it, you can go in peace.

10:25.840 --> 10:28.920
No problem. I'll keep you in my prayers.

10:29.000 --> 10:31.720
I have spent some truly wonderful days
with you all.

10:32.280 --> 10:34.720
Tokyo, get to it. They're coming for us.

10:42.400 --> 10:45.200
Tell us about Plan Chernobyl,

10:45.600 --> 10:47.440
or I'll break your whole stash.

10:49.800 --> 10:50.760
No.

10:51.440 --> 10:52.320
No.

10:58.800 --> 11:01.640
You're going to torture me
by breaking little bottles?

11:03.560 --> 11:05.600
Oh, Tokyo.

11:07.480 --> 11:10.840
So mature for some things,
and so childish for others.

11:12.320 --> 11:14.880
You should consider
something more convincing.

11:16.520 --> 11:18.200
Like cutting off one of my limbs.

11:18.280 --> 11:21.960
But I'm so high on opiates
that I might not even notice.

11:22.040 --> 11:22.880
Denver.

11:24.440 --> 11:25.400
Give me the gun.

11:55.920 --> 11:58.360
Tell us what Plan Chernobyl is.

11:59.160 --> 12:00.760
You don’t have what it takes.

12:01.360 --> 12:02.240
You don’t.

12:05.000 --> 12:05.840
Three.

12:07.360 --> 12:08.280
Two.

12:10.200 --> 12:11.080
One.

12:18.480 --> 12:21.240
Is there something you want to say now?

12:22.680 --> 12:23.600
I'll show you.

12:26.600 --> 12:27.760
You're going to get hurt.

12:29.280 --> 12:30.480
There goes number two.

12:37.360 --> 12:38.400
Son of a bitch.

13:12.480 --> 13:13.760
What the fuck are you doing?

13:20.920 --> 13:23.360
We're playing Russian roulette, Nairobi.

13:24.920 --> 13:26.520
Come back later.

13:28.280 --> 13:29.720
Damn it, Tokyo!

13:29.800 --> 13:32.720
Have you gone insane?
What the hell are you doing?

13:33.440 --> 13:36.160
Are you trying to get us all screwed?

13:36.520 --> 13:38.120
You're going to fuck up the plan.

13:38.640 --> 13:39.600
Clearly.

13:40.600 --> 13:41.520
All on your own.

13:49.000 --> 13:50.120
I'm fucking up the plan?

13:50.200 --> 13:55.800
You can't, can you?
You can't stop and think for once.

13:56.360 --> 13:57.920
Brainless piece of shit!

14:00.040 --> 14:04.240
I may be brainless, but your plan
to go find your son is absolute shit!

14:07.760 --> 14:09.320
What the hell are you saying?

14:09.640 --> 14:12.040
The last time he saw you, how old was he?
Three?

14:12.120 --> 14:14.560
-He doesn't remember you.
-Shut your fucking mouth.

14:14.640 --> 14:16.000
-He won't remember.
-Shut up.

14:16.080 --> 14:17.280
He won't recognize you.

14:17.360 --> 14:18.720
He already has a mother,

14:18.920 --> 14:22.160
and a father.
For him, they are the real ones.

14:22.240 --> 14:24.960
-You don't know shit!
-What?

14:25.040 --> 14:27.800
-You don't know shit!
-I know that you had him

14:27.880 --> 14:31.440
and abandoned him to get fucking pills!

14:32.680 --> 14:35.200
You know, I can't hear you very well.

14:35.840 --> 14:37.840
Get a little bit closer to the door,

14:37.920 --> 14:41.400
or, better yet,
just open the door and say it to my face!

14:41.480 --> 14:44.920
Fake bitch!
You missed your chance to be a mother.

14:45.120 --> 14:46.080
Face it.

14:48.400 --> 14:49.240
That's enough!

14:49.440 --> 14:50.800
Hey, Tokyo.

14:51.640 --> 14:53.680
This is getting a little out of hand.

14:54.160 --> 14:55.040
Don't you think?

14:57.000 --> 14:58.680
Didn't you say "no matter what"?

15:00.360 --> 15:01.320
This is it.

16:03.720 --> 16:04.600
Son!

16:06.360 --> 16:07.240
Listen to me!

16:08.120 --> 16:09.360
Come out immediately!

16:09.600 --> 16:12.560
-You're getting into really deep shit.
-Deep shit?

16:13.640 --> 16:16.240
What does it matter?
Everything has fallen apart!

16:18.600 --> 16:21.160
Look, forget about the Stockholm thing.

16:21.360 --> 16:24.160
We rushed to conclusions.
We are not doctors!

16:26.360 --> 16:27.520
Please don't...

16:27.920 --> 16:29.160
don't blow it.

16:31.720 --> 16:32.680
Do we come out?

16:33.800 --> 16:34.640
No.

16:35.240 --> 16:37.240
-Maybe we can still vote...
-No!

16:38.920 --> 16:40.280
We already did.

16:42.000 --> 16:43.000
Come on.

16:43.680 --> 16:45.920
Come on, finish it.

16:47.320 --> 16:49.400
If this is the end for me, shoot.

16:49.480 --> 16:51.000
Come on, Tokyo!

16:51.840 --> 16:53.560
I'm terminally ill.

16:53.960 --> 16:56.880
You won't be cutting short
my hopes and dreams.

16:57.520 --> 17:00.360
But if you're trying to scare me,
keep in mind

17:00.440 --> 17:03.880
that after blowing my head off,
you'll be the scared one.

17:04.360 --> 17:06.800
I'm the only one that knows the plan.

17:07.080 --> 17:10.680
You won't know
how to get out of this death trap!

17:11.720 --> 17:12.960
It's all of you

17:13.480 --> 17:15.520
who are playing Russian roulette!

17:16.160 --> 17:17.160
Go on!

17:18.720 --> 17:19.680
Get on with it.

18:07.400 --> 18:10.280
I'm sorry, Alberto. I got carried away.

18:11.280 --> 18:12.400
Please forgive me.

18:13.240 --> 18:14.080
Alberto.

18:28.600 --> 18:30.960
You're under arrest
for assaulting a police officer.

18:32.240 --> 18:33.120
Don't move!

18:38.000 --> 18:38.880
Stay there.

18:39.200 --> 18:42.120
Romero, I have a detainee.
Assault on a police officer.

18:42.280 --> 18:43.960
Take his prints and lock him up.

18:52.120 --> 18:53.880
Sit here. I'll be right back.

19:23.360 --> 19:24.320
Rest in peace.

19:32.960 --> 19:33.920
Helsinki.

19:36.040 --> 19:37.200
Whenever you're ready.

19:45.240 --> 19:47.000
Rest in peace, Oslo.

19:48.440 --> 19:49.920
The quietest one.

19:50.760 --> 19:52.280
And the unluckiest.

19:57.000 --> 19:58.400
I would come next.

20:34.160 --> 20:35.440
I earned it.

20:37.400 --> 20:41.320
While the others were on a break,
Berlin gave me what I deserved.

20:42.280 --> 20:44.600
Clearly and irreversibly.

21:06.280 --> 21:08.120
You look like a birthday present.

21:11.480 --> 21:13.160
You're only missing the bow.

21:19.000 --> 21:20.480
What are you going to do to me?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.920
Ration your energy, Tokyo.

21:27.320 --> 21:28.800
Are you going to kill me?

21:29.640 --> 21:30.560
No.

21:32.280 --> 21:33.360
I won't kill you.

21:34.680 --> 21:36.600
I won't torture you either.

21:48.320 --> 21:49.440
Son of a bitch.

21:49.800 --> 21:50.800
I hate you.

21:51.280 --> 21:53.000
Let me ask you something.

21:53.280 --> 21:55.760
Why does this have to be
the end of something?

21:56.800 --> 21:58.720
Couldn't it be the beginning

21:59.760 --> 22:01.840
of a beautiful friendship?

22:31.800 --> 22:33.240
That's how it all began.

22:34.400 --> 22:36.280
The beginning of the end of the heist.

22:37.280 --> 22:38.760
Of the days in confinement.

22:39.800 --> 22:40.960
Of my love for Rio.

22:42.080 --> 22:43.400
Of everyone's dreams.

22:44.680 --> 22:45.880
Of my freedom.

23:10.000 --> 23:11.760
Who is it? I can't see her face.

23:12.960 --> 23:14.160
It's Oliveira, sir.

23:32.080 --> 23:33.560
We've got her, sir.

23:36.640 --> 23:39.040
Why the hell have they turned in
one of their people?

23:43.880 --> 23:46.640
Everybody at 20 yards.
She may be carrying explosives.

23:46.720 --> 23:48.680
She's got explosives!
Security perimeter!

23:48.760 --> 23:50.240
Bomb hazard protocol, I repeat,

23:50.320 --> 23:52.480
bomb hazard protocol. It could be a trap.

23:52.560 --> 23:53.920
On the floor!

23:54.200 --> 23:56.640
Perimeter! She might be carrying a bomb!

24:00.000 --> 24:01.800
Tell her to take off her jumpsuit.

24:02.520 --> 24:04.680
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit!

24:06.800 --> 24:08.880
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit!

24:17.760 --> 24:18.720
Do it fast!

24:22.960 --> 24:25.400
Take off the boots and the jumpsuit, now!

25:05.920 --> 25:07.520
The t-shirt. Lift up your t-shirt!

25:15.440 --> 25:16.520
Restrain her.

25:17.880 --> 25:18.840
On the ground.

25:19.400 --> 25:20.440
Get on the ground!

25:21.320 --> 25:22.400
Hands up.

25:30.000 --> 25:31.280
Let's see your hands!

25:42.080 --> 25:44.320
Hold your fire. I repeat, hold your fire

25:44.800 --> 25:46.520
Nobody touches her.
I want her alive!

25:56.560 --> 25:57.480
Tokyo.

26:02.800 --> 26:04.080
Tokyo!

26:11.600 --> 26:12.560
Don't move!

26:12.960 --> 26:14.160
Don't move!

26:19.880 --> 26:20.920
Fuck!

26:28.360 --> 26:30.160
We're risking three things.

26:30.240 --> 26:33.320
Getting killed, getting wounded,
getting caught.

26:33.400 --> 26:36.120
Today we're going
to talk about that last one.

26:36.320 --> 26:37.280
Tokyo.

26:38.000 --> 26:39.720
What do you do if you get caught?

26:41.000 --> 26:42.240
Kick them in the nuts?

26:44.680 --> 26:50.120
Always keep in mind
the golden rule of the heist:

26:52.880 --> 26:53.800
Buy...

26:54.680 --> 26:55.600
time.

26:58.920 --> 27:01.280
Buying time and, indeed,

27:01.880 --> 27:04.480
exhausting every possible way of doing so.

27:22.040 --> 27:23.160
Oh, my stomach!

27:23.600 --> 27:25.120
-Let's go!
-I can't breathe.

27:26.040 --> 27:27.600
You messed me up, damn it!

27:29.200 --> 27:32.040
Sir, the detainee says she's in pain.

27:32.480 --> 27:34.080
She's saying she can't breathe.

27:34.160 --> 27:35.640
Requesting medical assistance.

27:36.240 --> 27:38.200
Okay, get her to a doctor.

27:39.000 --> 27:39.840
Copy that.

27:51.160 --> 27:54.440
Oh, it hurts. It hurts a lot.

27:54.600 --> 27:56.680
-Just a little further back.
-Damn!

28:10.520 --> 28:11.520
You lied to us.

28:28.200 --> 28:31.320
You said "no personal relations",
but Berlin calls you by your name.

28:33.320 --> 28:34.240
Sergio.

28:35.720 --> 28:37.720
Because that's your name, right?

28:38.600 --> 28:41.360
Tokyo, tomorrow
we may see things in a different...

28:41.440 --> 28:43.120
I won't see anything tomorrow.

28:43.600 --> 28:45.600
I got into this because I trusted you.

28:46.600 --> 28:48.960
Because you were going to be
our guardian angel.

28:50.400 --> 28:51.840
Guardian angels don't lie.

29:17.880 --> 29:18.960
My name is Sergio.

29:22.480 --> 29:23.600
Sergio Marquina.

29:27.800 --> 29:29.240
My father was a heist man.

29:32.400 --> 29:34.080
He was killed in a shootout

29:34.520 --> 29:36.560
with the police outside a bank.
It was him...

29:38.040 --> 29:39.600
who had the idea for the heist.

29:42.120 --> 29:46.080
Of all the people on board,
you're the one with the shortest fuse.

29:47.000 --> 29:50.680
And there will come a time when you think
that everything's falling apart.

29:52.400 --> 29:53.880
That everything is going wrong.

29:55.200 --> 29:57.120
That you're all alone.

29:58.880 --> 30:00.640
But I promise you that won't happen.

30:04.000 --> 30:05.480
I have it all figured out.

30:10.600 --> 30:12.400
Besides, I'm a lucky man.

30:14.520 --> 30:15.640
You're a lucky guy.

30:17.320 --> 30:18.800
Tokyo, I won't fail you.

30:21.080 --> 30:22.720
Always remember that.

30:29.000 --> 30:32.160
The worst that can happen
when you're leading a heist is,

30:32.240 --> 30:34.440
first: Getting arrested for beating up

30:34.520 --> 30:35.920
the inspector's ex-husband.

30:36.000 --> 30:37.480
Take his prints and lock him up.

30:37.560 --> 30:39.520
Second: The police asking you
for your ID.

30:39.600 --> 30:42.080
-ID.
-But only have a fake one.

30:44.400 --> 30:46.560
Third: That they take your fingerprints.

30:46.640 --> 30:48.640
And worse,
that they match the ones found on

30:48.720 --> 30:51.520
a patrol car that is part
of the investigation.

30:51.600 --> 30:53.040
Empty your pockets here.

30:53.120 --> 30:55.120
Fourth: That they take your belongings.

30:55.200 --> 30:57.520
Especially
when you have the keys to the hangar

30:57.600 --> 31:00.520
where you set up
and through which they will escape

31:00.600 --> 31:01.880
And a flask with poison...

31:02.240 --> 31:04.960
Those are meds for my heart condition.

31:05.040 --> 31:06.320
It's called Digoxin.

31:06.560 --> 31:09.640
That you were going to use to kill
the Inspector's mother hours ago.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.600
Come with me.

31:19.640 --> 31:21.600
Sit here until they take your statement.

31:40.640 --> 31:45.280
...from the Royal Mint, a few moments ago
the kidnappers have literally thrown out

31:45.360 --> 31:48.760
a person who was gagged
and tied to a stretcher.

31:48.880 --> 31:52.000
The person has been secured
by the Police Tactical Unit forces

31:52.400 --> 31:55.040
and identified as Silene Oliveira,
one of the kidnappers

31:55.120 --> 31:58.320
who was still in the factory,
and is currently being tended to

31:58.400 --> 32:01.760
by medical services
within the security perimeter.

32:02.480 --> 32:03.720
Tokyo lost her mind.

32:08.200 --> 32:09.480
She couldn't take it.

32:13.880 --> 32:14.840
It's not easy.

32:19.160 --> 32:21.080
But I didn’t have a choice.

32:28.520 --> 32:29.440
Hold hands.

32:34.000 --> 32:34.880
Please.

32:35.480 --> 32:37.280
We're all risking our lives here.

32:39.520 --> 32:42.040
It wouldn't kill you to hold hands.

32:45.480 --> 32:47.000
When you have a wound,

32:48.280 --> 32:50.760
the platelets come together to close it.

32:52.200 --> 32:54.360
If they don't, the body will die.

32:58.160 --> 32:59.840
We are wounded and we must unite.

32:59.920 --> 33:01.640
What are you talking about?

33:01.720 --> 33:03.200
-Rio.
-Who do you think you are?

33:03.560 --> 33:04.560
A preacher?

33:05.160 --> 33:06.360
The leader of a cult?

33:07.200 --> 33:09.280
Will you fly to space
holding his hand?

33:09.360 --> 33:10.240
Rio.

33:10.440 --> 33:12.240
-You need to calm down.
-No.

33:12.320 --> 33:13.400
I won't calm down!

33:13.880 --> 33:15.360
You sent Tokyo to prison.

33:17.080 --> 33:19.960
And you have the nerve
to ask me to calm down.

33:20.440 --> 33:21.680
She's my girlfriend.

33:21.960 --> 33:22.920
My girlfriend.

33:24.160 --> 33:25.720
And you ruined her life.

33:26.640 --> 33:27.960
It's your first love.

33:30.000 --> 33:32.960
Summer is over, you say goodbye
to Suzanne in the French Riviera.

33:33.040 --> 33:34.920
It seems like the end of the world.

33:35.000 --> 33:37.840
Shut your fucking mouth,
you fucking psychopath.

33:37.920 --> 33:40.760
You have no idea
what you're saying, okay?

33:42.200 --> 33:43.360
Anybody still sane?

33:47.160 --> 33:48.000
Moscow.

33:50.000 --> 33:51.560
Do you think this is right?

33:51.840 --> 33:52.680
Son.

33:53.560 --> 33:54.520
She lost it.

33:57.160 --> 33:58.240
We all saw it.

34:04.400 --> 34:05.240
Nairobi.

34:07.160 --> 34:08.960
There are rules here.

34:09.400 --> 34:11.960
We voted and she didn't accept it.

34:12.280 --> 34:13.840
And then she lost it.

34:16.800 --> 34:17.800
Denver.

34:18.720 --> 34:20.720
You realize this is bullshit, right?

34:20.880 --> 34:22.240
Of course I do, man.

34:23.000 --> 34:25.240
But she played
Russian roulette on Berlin.

34:25.880 --> 34:28.840
-What do you think?
-Nothing happened, damn it.

34:28.920 --> 34:30.880
But it was close, this close!

34:32.720 --> 34:35.680
Wake up, kid. Open your eyes.

34:36.160 --> 34:39.560
Tokyo lost it and we can't have
a bomb like that in here.

34:40.120 --> 34:41.080
I can't believe it.

34:42.160 --> 34:43.640
You're all on Berlin's side.

34:43.760 --> 34:45.560
You're all with a psychopath!

34:45.640 --> 34:47.280
We're not on Berlin's side.

34:47.880 --> 34:50.000
We're all on the Professor's side.

34:50.080 --> 34:51.000
The Professor?

34:52.160 --> 34:53.240
He's under arrest.

34:55.240 --> 34:56.760
We all saw it on TV.

34:57.480 --> 34:58.560
He won't call.

34:58.680 --> 35:00.840
He won't wait
on the other side of the tunnel.

35:04.320 --> 35:06.360
Now you'll say
that there are two hours left

35:06.440 --> 35:07.880
for the check-up call, right?

35:09.240 --> 35:10.280
Great.

35:11.800 --> 35:13.000
Because it's the last one.

35:14.920 --> 35:17.160
What will you do when he doesn't call?

35:19.320 --> 35:21.560
I'm not going to stick around to see it.

35:27.800 --> 35:29.120
We've seen hostages go.

35:29.840 --> 35:30.760
Tokyo is gone.

35:32.000 --> 35:34.240
I guess it won't matter if I go too,
right?

35:34.400 --> 35:35.840
You know it matters, Rio.

35:37.760 --> 35:40.000
But it's your decision and we respect it.

35:44.880 --> 35:46.040
Okay then.

35:51.000 --> 35:52.920
Is someone coming to shut the gate?

35:53.000 --> 35:53.880
Wait.

35:56.800 --> 35:57.840
When you leave...

35:58.800 --> 36:00.560
take this and wave it over your head,

36:01.520 --> 36:03.600
so that they see
you're coming peacefully.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.960
There are snipers and I wouldn't want
anything to happen to you.

36:07.720 --> 36:08.760
Give me a hug.

36:12.800 --> 36:14.000
I want you to do well.

36:15.680 --> 36:17.520
Never stop believing in love.

36:17.800 --> 36:18.880
It's beautiful.

36:20.680 --> 36:23.800
You must trust, trust, trust!

36:25.200 --> 36:27.960
Empty your mind in order to think clearly.

36:28.400 --> 36:29.440
Trust.

36:29.800 --> 36:31.440
Do it. Let yourself go.

36:32.000 --> 36:35.080
Let yourself go. That's it.

36:35.640 --> 36:37.680
He needs to rest and he'll be fine.

37:05.400 --> 37:08.320
Kill Berlin.

37:08.880 --> 37:10.160
Kill Berlin.

37:10.400 --> 37:12.720
Kill Berlin.

37:12.800 --> 37:17.680
Kill Berlin.

37:18.840 --> 37:20.840
Those were the only words in my head.

37:21.280 --> 37:22.480
But there was no way.

37:22.560 --> 37:23.640
Try as I might,

37:23.720 --> 37:26.600
I couldn't think of a way
of ruining Berlin's life

37:26.680 --> 37:28.520
that didn't also harm Rio.

37:28.800 --> 37:30.880
I could tell them
how we planned to escape,

37:31.200 --> 37:32.320
or where the hangar was.

37:32.640 --> 37:34.760
But any revenge would also fall upon Rio.

37:35.440 --> 37:36.520
My little Rio.

37:53.120 --> 37:54.040
Fuck!

38:00.240 --> 38:01.560
Son of a bitch. Fuck.

38:13.160 --> 38:15.480
Look who's here, Mr. Prieto.

38:15.680 --> 38:16.920
Miss Tokyo.

38:18.280 --> 38:20.400
Do you usually interrogate women
in underwear?

38:22.000 --> 38:23.160
Why did they turn you in?

38:24.720 --> 38:26.920
Well, shit happens.

38:27.480 --> 38:29.080
Why did they tie you up?

38:29.560 --> 38:30.880
I didn't see eye to eye

38:31.400 --> 38:32.640
with the person in charge.

38:32.880 --> 38:35.760
I tortured him and he didn’t take it well.

38:36.000 --> 38:36.920
Okay.

38:37.680 --> 38:40.880
I want you to know that your money
is still secured.

38:41.160 --> 38:44.400
Just like I found you once,
I'd find you when you get out of jail

38:44.480 --> 38:45.400
and you'd have it.

38:45.760 --> 38:47.560
I mean that we carry on with the plan.

38:47.640 --> 38:49.480
Because in the worst case

38:50.560 --> 38:53.520
you get your money after a few years,
and in the best case...

38:55.640 --> 38:59.640
I try to get you out of the joint
when things have calmed down.

38:59.720 --> 39:01.360
Carrying on with the plan means

39:02.080 --> 39:04.600
not talking to the police,
or to the judge,

39:05.280 --> 39:07.080
or to other inmates, right?

39:07.560 --> 39:10.960
-That's it.
-I'll bite, chew and swallow my tongue

39:11.040 --> 39:12.440
before I rat on anyone.

39:14.520 --> 39:18.680
Well, it's an effective method.
It's a bit rough, but it's effective.

39:18.760 --> 39:21.080
I was going to suggest
something a bit more...

39:22.440 --> 39:23.360
subtle.

39:23.720 --> 39:25.720
Being interrogated is a game of skill.

39:26.280 --> 39:29.480
Like flying a kite that can crash
at any moment.

39:29.840 --> 39:31.240
With your right hand...

39:32.040 --> 39:33.440
you release...

39:34.320 --> 39:37.000
the thread of the truth.

39:38.400 --> 39:40.400
How many of you are in there?

39:43.800 --> 39:44.640
Eight.

39:45.600 --> 39:47.560
The same ones that planned the heist

39:47.720 --> 39:48.680
in Toledo.

39:49.320 --> 39:53.120
And how long did it take you to plan
the heist in Toledo?

39:54.000 --> 39:54.920
Five months.

39:55.320 --> 39:56.520
When the kite takes off,

39:56.600 --> 39:58.760
when they believe you're telling
the truth,

39:58.840 --> 40:01.880
when they're certain they can get
something out of you,

40:02.640 --> 40:05.320
you pull on the thread
with your left hand,

40:05.400 --> 40:06.760
stopping the kite.

40:08.400 --> 40:09.600
You stall them.

40:10.320 --> 40:12.200
Are you wearing underpants, Colonel?

40:14.800 --> 40:18.000
I've always thought
that army guys like to let it hang.

40:18.400 --> 40:20.360
-Am I wrong?
-"Let it hang".

40:24.960 --> 40:27.840
Why the hell is this girl
not wearing any clothes?

40:32.480 --> 40:33.720
I apologize for that.

40:38.080 --> 40:40.240
Glad to see you again, Miss Tokyo.

40:41.120 --> 40:43.280
This time we'll be pragmatic.

40:43.360 --> 40:44.920
I ask and you answer.

40:47.080 --> 40:48.680
Who is the Professor?

41:16.920 --> 41:18.960
