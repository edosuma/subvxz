00:03.712 --> 00:05.839
<i>Previously on Your Honor...</i>

00:05.839 --> 00:08.425
<i>It's quite common
for an incarcerated individual</i>

00:08.425 --> 00:10.927
<i>to question if he has
anything to live for.</i>

00:10.927 --> 00:14.180
<i>You've suffered
unimaginable loss.</i>

00:22.939 --> 00:23.732
<i>Yes?</i>

00:23.732 --> 00:25.525
<i>That wasn't
a sanctioned hit on your son.</i>

00:25.525 --> 00:28.028
<i>The shooter was a member
of Desire, no?</i>

00:28.028 --> 00:30.363
<i>Let's not make this into
an all-out war.</i>

00:31.906 --> 00:33.283
Drop it, motherfucker.

00:33.283 --> 00:36.036
<i>How about we go back
to the Lower Ninth</i>

00:36.036 --> 00:37.287
<i>with more men.</i>

00:37.287 --> 00:41.207
<i>Patience is not inaction.</i>

00:41.207 --> 00:42.500
<i>He was nearly killed.</i>

00:42.500 --> 00:44.335
<i>Doesn't that act
demand retaliation?</i>

00:44.335 --> 00:46.463
<i>That act was retaliation.</i>

00:47.672 --> 00:49.841
<i>I don't need more psych evals.</i>

00:49.841 --> 00:51.217
My name is Olivia Delmont.

00:51.217 --> 00:53.136
<i>I'm an Assistant U.S. Attorney.</i>

00:53.136 --> 00:54.888
<i>Guard!</i>

00:54.888 --> 00:56.473
<i>You're gonna talk to me, Michael.</i>

00:56.473 --> 00:57.849
<i>Miss Lee! It's Eugene.</i>

00:57.849 --> 00:58.975
<i>I-I'm in trouble.
I need your help.</i>

01:00.560 --> 01:02.020
<i>So, what
you gonna do with him?</i>

01:02.020 --> 01:04.064
<i>There's only one way this ends.</i>

01:04.647 --> 01:09.152
<i>Look, I don't know if what Adam
and I had was the real thing.</i>

01:09.152 --> 01:11.696
<i>Adam was a terrible liar.</i>

01:11.696 --> 01:14.741
<i>So if he told you that
he loved you, then it was true.</i>

01:20.121 --> 01:22.582
<i>There's an address in there.
Stay gone.</i>

01:23.958 --> 01:24.959
<i>We got a problem.</i>

01:24.959 --> 01:28.338
<i>Adam Desiato was my godson.</i>

01:28.338 --> 01:30.757
<i>I want to be here
when Rudy brings in the killer.</i>

01:30.757 --> 01:34.594
<i>You think I'm gonna hand over
a young Black boy to the police?</i>

01:34.594 --> 01:39.390
<i>Rudy, here, finds another body,
one that can't talk,</i>

01:39.390 --> 01:40.850
<i>and I make for damn sure</i>

01:40.850 --> 01:43.061
<i>Eugene Jones is
never heard from again.</i>

01:46.314 --> 01:49.234
<i>How did you get
Kofi Jones to steal the car?</i>

01:49.234 --> 01:50.860
I called Charlie.

01:50.860 --> 01:53.154
<i>This right here...</i>

01:53.154 --> 01:55.573
<i>this is the end of his career.</i>

01:55.573 --> 01:57.242
<i>This is prison time.</i>

01:57.242 --> 01:59.786
<i>He helped you
in your hour of need.</i>

01:59.786 --> 02:03.456
<i>I am offering you a chance
to help bring down</i>

02:03.456 --> 02:06.334
<i>the single greatest threat
to New Orleans</i>

02:06.334 --> 02:09.379
<i>to atone for what you have done.</i>

02:17.637 --> 02:19.597
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

02:52.672 --> 02:54.632
This weekend you need to study.

02:55.884 --> 02:57.802
<i>Bud, can you help me with these?</i>

02:57.802 --> 02:59.679
<i>Grab a bag or two?</i>

02:59.679 --> 03:01.389
<i>One of you?</i>

03:01.389 --> 03:04.517
<i>I have the oven preheating.
Can one of you grab a bag?</i>

03:04.517 --> 03:06.394
<i>Can someone help me?</i>

03:06.394 --> 03:07.937
<i>All right.
- Thank you.</i>

03:07.937 --> 03:09.522
<i>Thank you.
- So many.</i>

03:09.522 --> 03:11.524
I know. It's a lot.

03:11.524 --> 03:13.193
<i>Grab one?</i>

04:17.548 --> 04:19.133
<i>Michael.</i>

04:30.061 --> 04:33.106
<i>When did you get released?</i>

04:33.106 --> 04:34.774
<i>This morning.</i>

04:34.774 --> 04:37.193
<i>How'd you get back
to New Orleans?</i>

04:37.193 --> 04:39.153
<i>Took a bus.</i>

04:39.153 --> 04:41.781
<i>Oh, I'm having
a few people over tonight.</i>

04:43.574 --> 04:45.410
<i>You're welcome to join us.</i>

04:47.412 --> 04:48.705
<i>Uh...</i>

04:49.872 --> 04:51.291
<i>No, I, um...</i>

04:52.750 --> 04:54.294
<i>I'm just tired.</i>

05:11.519 --> 05:13.229
<i>You're lucky I was home.</i>

05:13.229 --> 05:14.981
<i>The legislature's in session,</i>

05:14.981 --> 05:18.318
<i>but I wanted to get out of
Baton Rouge for a few days.</i>

05:21.362 --> 05:23.990
<i>There's toiletries
in the bathroom.</i>

05:28.202 --> 05:29.495
<i>Is there anything else you need?</i>

05:29.495 --> 05:31.706
<i>Uh.... Uh, no.</i>

05:32.290 --> 05:35.752
<i>I've got to admit, after a year
of radio silence</i>

05:35.752 --> 05:37.086
<i>I'm surprised to see you.</i>

05:37.086 --> 05:39.797
<i>I didn't want to be
a burden anymore.</i>

05:39.797 --> 05:41.341
Yeah.

05:41.341 --> 05:43.509
<i>So, I take it
you're not staying very long?</i>

05:44.677 --> 05:45.928
<i>No.</i>

05:47.388 --> 05:48.681
<i>Good.</i>

05:48.681 --> 05:50.683
<i>gentle, plaintive music</i>

06:08.493 --> 06:10.703
<i>deep, melancholy music</i>

06:34.852 --> 06:39.899
<i>Summertime</i>

06:42.110 --> 06:45.446
<i>And the living</i>

06:45.446 --> 06:49.242
<i>Is easy</i>

06:51.828 --> 06:56.249
<i>Fish are jumping</i>

06:58.167 --> 07:03.172
<i>And the cotton is high</i>

07:07.635 --> 07:12.723
<i>Oh, your daddy's rich</i>

07:13.641 --> 07:16.102
<i>And your ma</i>

07:16.102 --> 07:19.897
<i>Is good looking</i>

07:24.277 --> 07:28.948
<i>So hush, little baby</i>

07:29.866 --> 07:33.327
<i>Don't</i>

07:33.327 --> 07:36.581
<i>You cry</i>

07:47.633 --> 07:49.802
<i>You could sing to me all night.</i>

07:49.802 --> 07:51.679
<i>So stay awhile.</i>

07:52.847 --> 07:54.474
No, I got to work.

07:56.309 --> 07:58.853
<i>What good is being the boss
if you can't take a night off?</i>

07:58.853 --> 08:00.271
<i>Well, you know my pension plan</i>

08:00.271 --> 08:01.981
<i>a little better than most.
-</i>

08:01.981 --> 08:06.611
<i>Then I guess we'll have
to work out some extra PTO.</i>

08:06.611 --> 08:08.613
<i>So I can keep seeing you.</i>

08:08.613 --> 08:10.323
<i>Oh, you gonna be seeing me
a lot more.</i>

08:10.323 --> 08:12.325
<i>Oh, yeah? Why's that?</i>

08:14.035 --> 08:15.661
<i>The club about to be mine.</i>

08:15.661 --> 08:18.080
<i>Is that right?</i>

08:19.916 --> 08:21.459
<i>Yeah.</i>

08:28.216 --> 08:30.676
<i>Yeah.
- You got to go?</i>

08:30.676 --> 08:32.094
<i>Don't be like that.</i>

08:32.094 --> 08:33.763
<i>How am I supposed to be?
- Mm-mm.</i>

08:33.763 --> 08:35.348
<i>Don't be like that.</i>

08:40.019 --> 08:42.063
<i>I'll see you in a little bit.</i>

08:42.063 --> 08:43.523
<i>Okay.</i>

08:50.947 --> 08:52.907
Seven ODs in one night.

08:52.907 --> 08:55.493
<i>Two dead.
- It's bad product.</i>

08:55.493 --> 08:56.911
<i>Oh, you think?</i>

08:56.911 --> 08:58.246
They cut it with fentanyl.

08:58.246 --> 09:01.165
<i>Used a heavy hand
and ain't say shit.</i>

09:06.587 --> 09:08.130
<i>So?</i>

09:09.632 --> 09:11.217
<i>What do you want to do?</i>

09:13.594 --> 09:15.054
<i>Pull it.</i>

09:15.054 --> 09:16.639
<i>What do we do with
the three kilos of shit</i>

09:16.639 --> 09:18.641
<i>we can't sell?
- Find that Tony motherfucker</i>

09:18.641 --> 09:20.893
<i>that sold us that shit
and get a refund.</i>

09:20.893 --> 09:23.563
<i>If he can't make good,</i>

09:23.563 --> 09:26.065
<i>start breaking shit until he do.</i>

09:31.112 --> 09:32.905
Hey.

09:32.905 --> 09:35.157
<i>I ain't got shit to move.</i>

09:36.951 --> 09:38.494
<i>Let me make some calls.</i>

09:40.496 --> 09:42.081
I can't walk past his old room

09:42.081 --> 09:43.583
<i>without thinking of him.</i>

09:45.626 --> 09:48.588
<i>How late would he be
sleeping in these days?</i>

09:48.588 --> 09:50.923
<i>What trouble would he be
getting into?</i>

09:52.550 --> 09:55.344
<i>I'm the same way about Mom.</i>

09:55.344 --> 09:58.264
<i>I take the long way home
from work just to avoid</i>

09:58.264 --> 10:00.266
<i>her old neighborhood.
-</i>

10:02.184 --> 10:04.437
<i>If you have something
to say, Gina,</i>

10:04.437 --> 10:06.147
<i>we would love for you
to contribute.</i>

10:06.147 --> 10:09.859
<i>I just don't see the value
in collective whining.</i>

10:09.859 --> 10:11.986
<i>You don't have to be here.</i>

10:11.986 --> 10:14.030
<i>But how would I fill
my Thursday nights</i>

10:14.030 --> 10:16.324
<i>if I'm not listening to
a grown woman talk on and on</i>

10:16.324 --> 10:17.783
<i>about losing her mommy?</i>

10:18.993 --> 10:22.038
<i>We've all lost people
that we're close to.</i>

10:22.038 --> 10:24.332
<i>My son died, same as you.</i>

10:24.332 --> 10:25.833
<i>Maybe you're just not ready</i>

10:25.833 --> 10:28.169
<i>to admit that our pain
is exactly the same.</i>

10:28.169 --> 10:29.837
<i>Your son was a heroin addict</i>

10:29.837 --> 10:32.381
<i>who was hell-bent
on destroying his life.</i>

10:32.381 --> 10:36.636
<i>My Rocco was an angel,
and he was taken from me.</i>

10:38.012 --> 10:40.389
<i>May I ask why you attend
these meetings?</i>

10:41.682 --> 10:44.644
<i>My daughter suggested
I have anger issues.</i>

10:44.644 --> 10:46.187
<i>Yeah.</i>

10:46.187 --> 10:48.105
<i>Maybe you do.
- Oh, fuck you.</i>

11:05.331 --> 11:06.957
<i>There you go.
- Thanks.</i>

11:06.957 --> 11:08.542
<i>You're welcome, Ms. Baxter.</i>

11:51.877 --> 11:53.879
<i>What are you doing?
-</i>

11:55.256 --> 11:57.383
<i>I didn't realize
you were still here.</i>

12:01.429 --> 12:02.805
<i>It was a long night.</i>

12:02.805 --> 12:04.724
<i>I was just gonna use
your shower.</i>

12:04.724 --> 12:07.351
<i>The steam on mine is broken.
I'm sorry...</i>

12:07.351 --> 12:09.061
<i>It's fine. Help yourself.</i>

12:23.200 --> 12:25.161
<i>I'll make myself scarce.</i>

12:26.412 --> 12:28.414
<i>tranquil, plaintive music</i>

12:33.252 --> 12:35.337


13:24.678 --> 13:27.431
How was, uh, grief counseling?

13:29.350 --> 13:31.143
<i>I don't want to talk about that.</i>

13:37.358 --> 13:40.569
<i>Are you going
to the hotel today?</i>

13:41.570 --> 13:43.155
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

13:45.866 --> 13:47.743
Maybe you'll see Fia?

13:49.537 --> 13:51.121
<i>Is it a blue moon already?</i>

13:51.121 --> 13:53.374
<i>I saw her last night.</i>

13:54.333 --> 13:56.043
<i>What did she say?</i>

13:58.379 --> 14:00.756
<i>Oh, I am so
sick of her attitude.</i>

14:00.756 --> 14:02.758
<i>She's punishing us right now.</i>

14:02.758 --> 14:04.969
We didn't do anything to her!

14:06.512 --> 14:09.890
<i>Carlo, have you, have you
spoken with Fia recently?</i>

14:09.890 --> 14:12.059
<i>Couple days ago.</i>

14:12.059 --> 14:14.103
<i>Well, your mother and I
have given her</i>

14:14.103 --> 14:15.479
<i>everything that she's asked for.</i>

14:15.479 --> 14:17.815
<i>It's time for her
to return to this family.</i>

14:17.815 --> 14:20.109
<i>You talk to her, please?</i>

14:20.109 --> 14:21.402
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>

14:21.402 --> 14:24.071
<i>Michael Desiato is
out of prison.</i>

14:36.667 --> 14:38.627
<i>intense music</i>

15:13.287 --> 15:15.164
<i>Hey. Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

15:15.164 --> 15:16.248
<i>Business?</i>

15:16.248 --> 15:18.584
<i>What?
- Where you going?</i>

15:18.584 --> 15:22.254
<i>I'm just going to see the mayor.</i>

15:22.254 --> 15:24.173
<i>He's expecting you?</i>

15:26.008 --> 15:28.761
<i>I... No, he's, he's...</i>

15:28.761 --> 15:30.012
<i>he's my best friend.</i>

15:30.012 --> 15:31.597
<i>Your name?</i>

15:32.556 --> 15:33.933
<i>Desiato.</i>

15:33.933 --> 15:36.018
<i>Michael Desiato.</i>

15:40.648 --> 15:43.275
<i>You've been banned
from this building.</i>

15:43.275 --> 15:46.153
<i>Look, I...
- Turn it around. Let's go.</i>

15:46.153 --> 15:48.030
<i>You're holding up my line.</i>

15:59.333 --> 16:01.043
<i>Alan.</i>

16:06.799 --> 16:08.509
<i>Judge Desiato.</i>

16:13.973 --> 16:17.476
<i>They... they won't let me in.</i>

16:17.476 --> 16:19.645
<i>No. [sighs]</i>

16:19.645 --> 16:21.313
<i>I imagine not.</i>

16:23.273 --> 16:25.484
<i>gentle, wistful music</i>

16:59.893 --> 17:01.979
<i>So, what was your plan?</i>

17:01.979 --> 17:04.732
<i>Hmm? Just walk into
the mayor's office</i>

17:04.732 --> 17:05.774
<i>and warn your buddy</i>

17:05.774 --> 17:07.359
<i>that he might be in trouble?</i>

17:09.153 --> 17:11.196
<i>Come on, Michael.</i>

17:11.196 --> 17:13.032
<i>Do you honestly think
that I'd let you do that?</i>

17:13.032 --> 17:16.326
<i>I can't even allow you
to enter the building.</i>

17:18.454 --> 17:21.999
<i>If you warn Charlie,
or anyone else,</i>

17:21.999 --> 17:24.043
<i>if you so much as whisper</i>

17:24.043 --> 17:27.046
<i>the words "federal
investigation" to yourself</i>

17:27.046 --> 17:29.548
<i>in the middle of
a thunderstorm, the deal's off.</i>

17:29.548 --> 17:31.884
<i>That means
you are back in prison.</i>

17:31.884 --> 17:35.220
<i>That means your friend
Charlie is right behind you.</i>

17:37.473 --> 17:39.349
<i>I-I can't do this.</i>

17:40.768 --> 17:43.937
<i>I'm-I'm, I'm not refusing.
I am telling you.</i>

17:43.937 --> 17:46.231
<i>I-I don't have the ability.</i>

17:46.231 --> 17:47.816
<i>I know.</i>

17:50.319 --> 17:52.362
<i>Then why are you
doing this to me?</i>

17:58.952 --> 18:01.872
<i>I got you some clothes.</i>

18:02.831 --> 18:04.374
<i>I don't need clothes.</i>

18:04.374 --> 18:07.044
<i>Yes, you do,
because I got you a job.</i>

18:08.170 --> 18:10.756
<i>Why?
- Standard work release.</i>

18:10.756 --> 18:13.509
<i>I got to make your exit
from prison look legit.</i>

18:16.678 --> 18:18.931
<i>Thank you.
-</i>

18:18.931 --> 18:20.307
There she is.

18:20.307 --> 18:22.768
<i>Otis, my friend.
How you doing?</i>

18:24.478 --> 18:26.355
<i>This him?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

18:27.689 --> 18:28.899
<i>You just got out?</i>

18:28.899 --> 18:30.359
<i>Yes.</i>

18:31.652 --> 18:33.403
You planning to go back?

18:36.740 --> 18:38.450
<i>I don't make plans.</i>

18:38.450 --> 18:41.286
<i>You know your way
around a carcass?</i>

18:42.496 --> 18:44.289
<i>Not really.
- I'm thinking</i>

18:44.289 --> 18:48.210
<i>an assignment that would
get him out into the world.</i>

18:50.212 --> 18:51.713
<i>Come on back.</i>

18:54.508 --> 18:56.009
<i>Come on.</i>

19:04.393 --> 19:05.686
<i>That one.</i>

19:08.814 --> 19:10.649
<i>You remember me, Judge?</i>

19:12.192 --> 19:13.443
<i>No.</i>

19:13.443 --> 19:16.113
<i>I was in your courtroom.
Drug possession.</i>

19:16.113 --> 19:19.199
<i>Prosecutor charged me
with intent to distribute.</i>

19:19.199 --> 19:21.493
<i>Jury gave me 14 years.</i>

19:21.493 --> 19:24.872
<i>You reduced that sentence
to eight months.</i>

19:24.872 --> 19:27.875
<i>You said, "Good people
don't belong in prison."</i>

19:29.668 --> 19:31.461
<i>Follow me.</i>

19:41.430 --> 19:43.390
<i>Driver quit last week.</i>

19:44.808 --> 19:46.518
<i>The job's yours, if you want it.</i>

19:55.485 --> 19:57.154
<i>I just spent that
on a grand</i>

19:57.154 --> 19:58.363
<i>I take that work,
I make that work</i>

19:58.363 --> 19:59.656
<i>I make it yoga stretch</i>

19:59.656 --> 20:01.158
<i>I'm jogging, jogging...</i>

20:25.015 --> 20:28.060
<i>Double latte for Maurice.</i>

20:28.060 --> 20:29.561
<i>It's been a minute.</i>

20:33.023 --> 20:34.316
<i>How's my auntie?</i>

20:34.316 --> 20:36.235
<i>She's good.</i>

20:36.235 --> 20:38.946
<i>You staying out of trouble?</i>

20:38.946 --> 20:40.239
Tryin'.

20:40.239 --> 20:42.741
<i>Ah, there's no try, Little Man.</i>

20:44.534 --> 20:46.203
<i>Not with last chances.</i>

20:51.833 --> 20:53.669
<i>That's the last one.</i>

21:05.055 --> 21:07.140
<i>My God, it really is you.</i>

21:21.989 --> 21:24.908
<i>I tried to visit you many times.</i>

21:25.993 --> 21:27.369
I know.

21:29.329 --> 21:33.625
<i>We never got a chance to,
to talk about...</i>

21:39.881 --> 21:41.466
<i>You didn't belong in prison.</i>

21:41.466 --> 21:44.845
<i>But I know you.
I know you protected me.</i>

21:50.726 --> 21:52.185
<i>You...</i>

21:52.185 --> 21:54.563
<i>You-you may still be exposed.</i>

21:56.189 --> 21:57.691
<i>You need to watch yourself.</i>

22:00.986 --> 22:04.990
<i>There were only three people
who knew about my role in that.</i>

22:04.990 --> 22:06.950
<i>Rudy's never gonna talk,</i>

22:06.950 --> 22:09.619
<i>and the other two people
are sitting right here.</i>

22:09.619 --> 22:11.580
<i>So I got nothing to worry about.</i>

22:16.877 --> 22:19.671
<i>Losing Adam was my penance, too.</i>

22:19.671 --> 22:21.590
<i>I've paid for my sins.</i>

22:23.884 --> 22:27.179
<i>I loved that boy
like he was my own.</i>

22:31.475 --> 22:33.685
<i>You can't dig graves
deep enough in this city</i>

22:33.685 --> 22:35.354
<i>to hide them from the storms.</i>

22:35.354 --> 22:38.690
<i>Water will get
to the bodies every time.</i>

22:38.690 --> 22:40.776
<i>Only sure thing about
the dirt beneath our feet</i>

22:40.776 --> 22:42.694
<i>is that it'll wash away one day.</i>

22:42.694 --> 22:46.823
<i>You asked me to bury
something and now...</i>

22:46.823 --> 22:48.283
<i>here we are.</i>

22:48.283 --> 22:51.244
<i>Shame on us for not knowing
our city better.</i>

22:54.373 --> 22:56.500
<i>It was a car.</i>

22:56.500 --> 22:57.793
<i>Not a body.</i>

22:59.419 --> 23:01.254
<i>It was a coffin.</i>

23:01.254 --> 23:03.382
<i>With a set of headlights.</i>

23:13.975 --> 23:15.727
Who is it?

23:15.727 --> 23:17.354
Housekeeping.

23:18.980 --> 23:21.858
<i>It gets funnier every time.
-</i>

23:22.484 --> 23:25.112
<i>Don't open the door if you can't
see who's on the other side.</i>

23:25.112 --> 23:27.239
<i>Okay, Dad.</i>

23:29.241 --> 23:31.827
<i>When was the last time
you talked to our father?</i>

23:31.827 --> 23:33.245
<i>Why do you care?</i>

23:33.245 --> 23:35.038
<i>Making them miserable.</i>

23:35.038 --> 23:36.581
<i>Stop trying to be the bad seed.</i>

23:36.581 --> 23:38.792
<i>That's my job.
- Okay.</i>

23:38.792 --> 23:41.211
<i>I'll stay in my lane.</i>

23:46.508 --> 23:48.510
<i>You need anything from me?
- Yeah.</i>

23:48.510 --> 23:50.429
<i>Um...</i>

23:50.429 --> 23:54.015
<i>Grab some new towels
and turn down the bed, okay?</i>

24:01.106 --> 24:03.316
<i>Hey, yo.</i>

24:04.651 --> 24:07.070
<i>What's the family discount
for an oil change?</i>

24:07.070 --> 24:09.448
Oh, cuz. What's up, boy?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.741
<i>Hey, you know,
family in-house free-99.</i>

24:11.741 --> 24:13.785
<i>Now, for cousins...</i>

24:13.785 --> 24:16.746
<i>might get you ten percent off.
- Oh, boy, you crazy.</i>

24:16.746 --> 24:18.623
<i>Are you ready to get paid?</i>

24:23.170 --> 24:25.464
<i>Now you know I got you
on the finder's fee,</i>

24:25.464 --> 24:27.674
<i>but I need you
to make this intro.</i>

24:27.674 --> 24:29.176
<i>'Cause I'm not going back
to New Orleans</i>

24:29.176 --> 24:31.803
<i>empty-handed and assed out,
you heard me?</i>

24:34.347 --> 24:37.142
<i>I've owned this club
for more than 30 years,</i>

24:37.142 --> 24:38.685
<i>so I'm only gonna
consider selling it</i>

24:38.685 --> 24:40.437
<i>when the timing's right.</i>

24:40.437 --> 24:42.981
<i>Well, I happen to know
you hired a real estate agent,</i>

24:42.981 --> 24:45.942
<i>so... timing must be close.</i>

24:45.942 --> 24:47.944
<i>Mm.</i>

24:47.944 --> 24:51.531
<i>Look, I'm a bar owner myself
and I'm looking to expand.</i>

24:51.531 --> 24:53.366
<i>Sure you can appreciate that.</i>

24:53.366 --> 24:57.329
<i>Plus, this establishment holds
a special place for me.</i>

24:57.329 --> 24:58.997
<i>Can we just cut the bullshit?</i>

24:58.997 --> 25:03.168
<i>I am not selling my club
for drug money.</i>

25:17.098 --> 25:18.350
<i>Yo, Roderick.</i>

25:20.268 --> 25:21.645
<i>What's up, fellas?</i>

25:26.942 --> 25:28.818
<i>Is there somewhere we can talk?</i>

25:28.818 --> 25:31.238
<i>Oh, here's good.
It's my nephew.</i>

25:31.238 --> 25:33.949
<i>He's gonna go pretty far
as long as he stops</i>

25:33.949 --> 25:36.660
<i>dropping his shoulder.</i>

25:39.412 --> 25:40.956
<i>Hey, Roderick.</i>

25:40.956 --> 25:43.124
<i>My cousin looking to move
some product in the Boot.</i>

25:43.124 --> 25:44.584
<i>Ain't got no connect there?</i>

25:44.584 --> 25:46.503
<i>No one that's up
to my standards.</i>

25:46.503 --> 25:48.880
<i>Yeah, my shit is
five stars, huh?</i>

25:48.880 --> 25:53.009
<i>But top-tier quality
come top-tier price.</i>

25:53.009 --> 25:55.595
<i>Well, money ain't no thing.</i>

25:55.595 --> 25:57.889
<i>Let's start with two keys.</i>

25:57.889 --> 26:01.226
<i>If it makes the customers happy,
maybe we'll come back for more.</i>

26:04.688 --> 26:06.064
<i>Yeah, that doesn't work
for me, homie.</i>

26:06.064 --> 26:07.607
<i>I-I move weight, you know?</i>

26:07.607 --> 26:08.984
<i>I was thinking, like,
ten times that amount.</i>

26:10.277 --> 26:12.445
<i>How about we start with two?</i>

26:13.446 --> 26:15.240
<i>And then see how it goes.</i>

26:19.077 --> 26:21.121
<i>How about we start with 20?</i>

26:23.790 --> 26:25.917
<i>Let me talk to you for a second.</i>

26:30.380 --> 26:33.174
<i>I got to beg a drug dealer
to sell me drugs?</i>

26:33.174 --> 26:34.843
Man, it is what it is.

26:34.843 --> 26:36.761
<i>The product is right,
the price is right.</i>

26:36.761 --> 26:38.680
<i>Big Mo needs it.
Just make the deal.</i>

26:38.680 --> 26:40.724
<i>We don't need that much product.</i>

26:43.643 --> 26:45.353
<i>And I ain't got that much cash.</i>

26:45.353 --> 26:46.938
<i>Well, get it.</i>

26:46.938 --> 26:50.108
<i>That way we can do one deal
instead of ten.</i>

26:50.108 --> 26:52.485
<i>And I ain't got to play
the middleman after this.</i>

27:03.788 --> 27:05.790
I need to see Justin.

27:07.083 --> 27:09.127
Justin.

27:09.127 --> 27:11.296
<i>Justin.</i>

27:11.296 --> 27:13.131
Justin. Come with me.

27:13.131 --> 27:15.050
Ooh, busted.

27:21.014 --> 27:22.974
<i>gentle, intriguing music</i>

27:25.935 --> 27:27.520
Okay, let's go.

27:31.941 --> 27:33.985
<i>I find these
images to be very troubling.</i>

27:35.195 --> 27:36.571
<i>It's just a character.</i>

27:37.364 --> 27:39.741
<i>This gun is
in the hand of a boy that looks</i>

27:39.741 --> 27:41.117
<i>exactly like you.</i>

27:41.117 --> 27:44.329
<i>This house set on fire
by that same boy.</i>

27:44.329 --> 27:46.206
<i>He didn't set the house on fire.</i>

27:47.707 --> 27:49.000
<i>He escaped.</i>

27:53.171 --> 27:56.091
<i>My top priority is
protecting my students</i>

27:56.091 --> 27:57.842
<i>and you are one of
my students now.</i>

27:57.842 --> 27:59.094
<i>So I'm worried.</i>

27:59.094 --> 28:01.137
<i>I just like to draw.</i>

28:01.137 --> 28:05.266
<i>I need to know if you're
capable of harming someone else.</i>

28:09.854 --> 28:12.148
<i>Hello, Monique.</i>

28:13.733 --> 28:15.360
<i>Mr. Mayor.</i>

28:16.653 --> 28:20.323
<i>Yeah, let me get a coffee,
black, four sugars.</i>

28:24.244 --> 28:25.620
<i>When I asked for a meeting</i>

28:25.620 --> 28:27.038
<i>I didn't mean
you need to come to me.</i>

28:27.038 --> 28:28.415
<i>Are you kidding?</i>

28:28.415 --> 28:29.874
<i>Any excuse to come
to the Lower Nine.</i>

28:29.874 --> 28:31.876
<i>And here I thought
I may not be welcome</i>

28:31.876 --> 28:33.837
<i>in the mayor's office.</i>

28:33.837 --> 28:36.172
<i>Everyone is welcome
in the people's office.</i>

28:36.172 --> 28:38.883
<i>Long as it's
the "People's City."</i>

28:38.883 --> 28:40.510
<i>Precisely.</i>

28:41.886 --> 28:44.556
<i>Thank you kindly.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

28:44.556 --> 28:46.725
<i>So, what can I do for you?</i>

28:48.059 --> 28:49.686
<i>I want to buy the Grand Rain.</i>

28:49.686 --> 28:52.439
<i>You gonna run a nightclub
in the Quarter?</i>

28:52.439 --> 28:54.816
<i>Moving up in the world.</i>

28:54.816 --> 28:56.651
<i>Well, I wish you
the best of luck.</i>

28:57.569 --> 28:59.738
<i>That owner,
he a friend of yours?</i>

28:59.738 --> 29:02.407
<i>He's a contributor.</i>

29:02.407 --> 29:03.783
<i>He's an asshole.</i>

29:03.783 --> 29:05.535
<i>No doubt about that.</i>

29:05.535 --> 29:07.912
<i>He don't want to sell
to someone like me.</i>

29:07.912 --> 29:10.123
<i>What?
An industrious entrepreneur?</i>

29:10.123 --> 29:12.000
<i>Precisely.</i>

29:13.918 --> 29:15.420
The thing is,

29:15.420 --> 29:18.423
<i>I don't really have
much say in the matter.</i>

29:18.423 --> 29:21.426
<i>You say you want to champion
for Black-owned businesses,</i>

29:21.426 --> 29:23.928
<i>why not help a Black owner
get her hand on a business?</i>

29:23.928 --> 29:25.972
<i>Sort of hard for me
to tell a man to take your money</i>

29:25.972 --> 29:27.807
<i>seeing where that money
comes from.</i>

29:27.807 --> 29:30.727
<i>Wasn't hard for the last mayor
to do that for Jimmy Baxter.</i>

29:32.353 --> 29:35.398
<i>You and I have come to
a successful agreement before.</i>

29:35.398 --> 29:39.611
<i>One might argue
it put you where you are today.</i>

29:39.611 --> 29:43.323
<i>You know, in my position,
every day brings a new problem.</i>

29:44.491 --> 29:47.202
<i>And you know
what my problem is today?</i>

29:48.453 --> 29:51.664
<i>I got drug users
overdosing in my city.</i>

29:52.999 --> 29:54.626
<i>Your neighborhood.</i>

29:54.626 --> 29:56.377
<i>I can't have that.</i>

29:59.172 --> 30:01.090
<i>And I'll take care
of that for you.</i>

30:01.090 --> 30:02.592
<i>Good.</i>

30:05.345 --> 30:07.931
<i>Then our secrets remain secrets.</i>

30:07.931 --> 30:10.475
<i>So, I can count
on your support, then?</i>

30:10.475 --> 30:11.976
<i>As long as I can count on this</i>

30:11.976 --> 30:14.145
<i>being the last time
you ask for it.</i>

30:16.689 --> 30:18.650
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

30:25.406 --> 30:26.658
<i>There you go.</i>

30:26.658 --> 30:28.576
<i>Yeah.</i>

30:31.663 --> 30:33.873
<i>Yeah, just sign.</i>

30:35.708 --> 30:37.502
<i>Thanks.
- You're welcome.</i>

30:57.063 --> 30:59.023
<i>pulsing, dramatic music</i>

31:17.834 --> 31:19.669
<i>Mr. Desiato.</i>

31:19.669 --> 31:21.004
<i>Fia.</i>

31:22.714 --> 31:24.048
<i>Hi.</i>

31:24.048 --> 31:26.593
<i>You're, you're out.</i>

31:26.593 --> 31:28.636
<i>And you're...</i>

31:28.636 --> 31:30.763
<i>Yes, uh...</i>

31:34.058 --> 31:35.560
<i>I got to work somewhere.</i>

31:35.560 --> 31:38.730
<i>Right, of course.
- And you?</i>

31:38.730 --> 31:40.899
<i>Got to eat somewhere.</i>

31:40.899 --> 31:42.233
<i>Right.</i>

31:43.902 --> 31:45.194
<i>Uh, would you want to join me?</i>

31:45.194 --> 31:46.905
<i>For, like...
- No, no, I...</i>

31:46.905 --> 31:49.115
<i>I-I can't. I, uh...</i>

31:56.205 --> 31:58.082
<i>It's, it's...</i>

31:58.082 --> 32:02.295
<i>strange, uh,
seeing you in this place.</i>

32:04.339 --> 32:06.299
<i>I actually live here now.</i>

32:06.299 --> 32:08.259
<i>So, how's that for strange?</i>

32:08.259 --> 32:10.595
<i>My friends think it's creepy.</i>

32:10.595 --> 32:12.972
<i>They don't really get it.</i>

32:13.514 --> 32:16.309
<i>Well, they don't know
what you're going through.</i>

32:17.352 --> 32:18.353
<i>You do.</i>

32:18.353 --> 32:20.605
No.

32:24.150 --> 32:26.903
<i>We all lost Adam in our own way.</i>

32:28.529 --> 32:31.157
<i>You know, sometimes I think
the things I miss the most</i>

32:31.157 --> 32:33.451
<i>are the things
I didn't get to experience.</i>

32:34.911 --> 32:37.455
<i>There were so many
conversations we never had.</i>

32:37.455 --> 32:40.541
<i>Questions I never asked him.</i>

32:40.541 --> 32:44.963
<i>What would you... ask him?
If, if you could?</i>

32:44.963 --> 32:48.383
<i>It's kind of fucked up
to say, but, uh...</i>

32:50.093 --> 32:51.636
<i>I would ask him,</i>

32:51.636 --> 32:54.138
<i>"What do you think
happens to us when we die?"</i>

32:54.138 --> 32:57.809
<i>Did he believe
in heaven and hell,</i>

32:57.809 --> 33:00.770
<i>and all the things
my mother is obsessed with,</i>

33:00.770 --> 33:03.523
<i>that I never bought into?</i>

33:05.858 --> 33:08.987
<i>It's just I,
I keep thinking, you know,</i>

33:08.987 --> 33:10.655
<i>what if I'm wrong?</i>

33:10.655 --> 33:12.156
You would have liked having

33:12.156 --> 33:14.325
<i>those conversations with Adam.</i>

33:16.786 --> 33:18.496
<i>He...</i>

33:18.496 --> 33:21.249
<i>he enjoyed asking questions.</i>

33:23.042 --> 33:24.585
<i>Mm.</i>

33:24.585 --> 33:26.838
<i>Well, what do you think
about all that stuff?</i>

33:26.838 --> 33:31.718
<i>I don't know about God and,
and all that...</i>

33:35.680 --> 33:37.849
<i>...but I...</i>

33:37.849 --> 33:42.895
<i>I do think that good people
go where they deserve.</i>

33:59.662 --> 34:02.707
<i>Mr. Desiato, um, there's
somebody that I would really</i>

34:02.707 --> 34:04.584
<i>like for you to...
- I've got to go.</i>

34:04.584 --> 34:06.919
<i>Can you please, please
just promise me another time.</i>

34:06.919 --> 34:08.504
<i>Y... Okay, yes.</i>

34:14.677 --> 34:17.388
<i>gentle, plaintive music</i>

35:00.598 --> 35:02.642
<i>Amazing.</i>

35:02.642 --> 35:05.353
<i>Now that there's no more lies,
you've got nothing left to say.</i>

35:16.155 --> 35:18.658
<i>I devoted so much
to your family.</i>

35:18.658 --> 35:20.284
<i>I know you were trying
to protect Adam,</i>

35:20.284 --> 35:22.662
<i>but goddamn it, Michael,
you should have trusted me.</i>

35:22.662 --> 35:24.205
<i>Instead you just...</i>

35:25.665 --> 35:28.167
<i>...lied...</i>

35:28.167 --> 35:30.169
<i>manipulated and used me.</i>

35:30.169 --> 35:33.172
<i>You may be free now,</i>

35:33.172 --> 35:35.007
<i>but that's not gonna
last forever.</i>

35:35.007 --> 35:37.593
<i>And when your
guardian angel vanishes,</i>

35:37.593 --> 35:39.679
<i>I'm gonna be
the next thing you see.</i>

35:51.691 --> 35:53.776
<i>slow, tense music</i>

37:18.778 --> 37:19.946
<i>All right.</i>

37:19.946 --> 37:22.240
Everything all right?

37:22.240 --> 37:25.743
<i>I need a guardian signature
to prove we spoke about this.</i>

37:32.458 --> 37:33.918
<i>Is this about your drawings?</i>

37:37.838 --> 37:39.548
<i>I'm not your legal guardian.</i>

37:44.136 --> 37:45.388
<i>What is it?</i>

37:47.390 --> 37:49.934
<i>My principal asked me
if I was a violent person.</i>

37:51.811 --> 37:54.146
<i>Do you think
you're a violent person?</i>

37:56.649 --> 37:59.777
<i>Whatever good is in a person,</i>

37:59.777 --> 38:01.612
<i>the seed of that goodness,</i>

38:01.612 --> 38:04.031
<i>it's in them for life.</i>

38:04.031 --> 38:07.910
<i>And the bad
can always be uprooted.</i>

38:07.910 --> 38:09.912
<i>Whatever's in your past,</i>

38:09.912 --> 38:11.914
<i>that does not
define you, Justin.</i>

38:11.914 --> 38:13.207
<i>That's not my name.</i>

38:21.674 --> 38:23.801
If you can be Justin,

38:23.801 --> 38:25.928
<i>I can be Justin's mom.</i>

38:25.928 --> 38:27.972
<i>slow, wistful music</i>

39:08.512 --> 39:10.389
<i>Hold on, hold on a sec.</i>

39:10.389 --> 39:12.099
<i>Let me get this off.</i>

39:12.099 --> 39:13.601
<i>There you go.</i>

39:25.404 --> 39:28.199
<i>Why on Earth are you
sleeping in my pantry?</i>

39:28.199 --> 39:31.744
<i>The guest room is too big.</i>

39:31.744 --> 39:35.039
<i>You find it cozier in there
underneath my biscuit mix?</i>

39:35.039 --> 39:38.376
<i>And don't you dare tell anyone
I'm using a mix.</i>

39:41.087 --> 39:45.716
<i>I'll... find some other
place to sleep.</i>

39:45.716 --> 39:47.802
There's no need for that.

39:47.802 --> 39:49.970
<i>You're a guest.</i>

39:49.970 --> 39:52.056
<i>This house has a guest room.</i>

39:52.056 --> 39:53.891
<i>You'll sleep there.</i>

40:03.609 --> 40:05.277
<i>Talked to Fia today.</i>

40:05.277 --> 40:07.571
<i>I think she just needs
some space.</i>

40:10.366 --> 40:11.700
<i>Space?</i>

40:13.327 --> 40:15.788
<i>No, the problem with
younger people</i>

40:15.788 --> 40:18.833
<i>is that you don't worry
about time.</i>

40:18.833 --> 40:21.210
<i>You can get space anywhere,
much as you want.</i>

40:21.210 --> 40:23.712
<i>But time?</i>

40:23.712 --> 40:25.840
<i>You never get that back.</i>

40:25.840 --> 40:28.217
<i>And one of the reasons
we have children</i>

40:28.217 --> 40:31.429
<i>is to reset the clock.</i>

40:31.429 --> 40:33.389
<i>I'm still here.</i>

40:36.016 --> 40:37.560
<i>Fia's not gone.</i>

40:39.603 --> 40:41.439
<i>You're a good brother, Carlo.</i>

40:59.498 --> 41:01.917
<i>Where you sneaking off to
every morning?</i>

41:04.503 --> 41:06.380
<i>The cemetery.</i>

41:10.009 --> 41:11.510
<i>You see this?</i>

41:14.513 --> 41:16.348
<i>It's a cereus.</i>

41:17.641 --> 41:19.518
<i>It blooms once a year.</i>

41:20.644 --> 41:21.812
<i>And whenever that happens,</i>

41:21.812 --> 41:24.190
<i>I'm gonna take it
to their grave.</i>

41:24.190 --> 41:25.941
<i>Once a year.</i>

41:28.027 --> 41:29.612
<i>There's no reason to go
all the time.</i>

41:29.612 --> 41:31.030
<i>They're not there.</i>

41:31.030 --> 41:33.699
<i>Staring at a headstone's
not gonna bring you</i>

41:33.699 --> 41:35.034
<i>any closer to them.</i>

41:42.333 --> 41:44.668
<i>Hey, there, Dick.</i>

41:46.837 --> 41:49.215
<i>Mr. Mayor.</i>

41:49.215 --> 41:50.841
<i>What can I do for you?</i>

41:50.841 --> 41:52.343
<i>Well, I was hoping to watch</i>

41:52.343 --> 41:54.720
<i>a good old-fashioned
business deal transpire.</i>

41:54.720 --> 41:56.305
<i>Monique here tells me</i>

41:56.305 --> 41:58.349
<i>y'all are in the middle
of a heated negotiation.</i>

41:58.349 --> 42:00.434
<i>Maybe we can
sort it out right now.</i>

42:00.434 --> 42:02.019
<i>There's really no need for you</i>

42:02.019 --> 42:03.812
<i>to concern yourself
with this matter.</i>

42:03.812 --> 42:05.981
Well, I'd rather not, but, um,

42:05.981 --> 42:10.361
<i>I'm a little worried that
if this deal doesn't go through,</i>

42:10.361 --> 42:13.113
<i>the Historic
Landmarks Commission</i>

42:13.113 --> 42:14.448
<i>might take a closer look</i>

42:14.448 --> 42:16.033
<i>at some of the changes
you've made.</i>

42:16.033 --> 42:18.494
<i>Could hold you up for a year.</i>

42:18.494 --> 42:20.162
<i>Maybe two.</i>

42:21.872 --> 42:24.333
<i>This place has been my life.</i>

42:24.333 --> 42:26.627
<i>Can't sell it to just anyone.</i>

42:26.627 --> 42:29.421
<i>I'm not asking you to
sell it to just anyone.</i>

42:29.421 --> 42:31.131
<i>I'm asking you
to sell it to her.</i>

42:31.131 --> 42:33.467
<i>My money's just as green
as anyone else's.</i>

42:33.467 --> 42:36.887
<i>Look, I don't mean to be
insulting, but, uh...</i>

42:40.558 --> 42:42.476
<i>Maybe you do mean
to be insulting.</i>

42:42.476 --> 42:44.562
<i>I tell you my pawpaw used to</i>

42:44.562 --> 42:46.730
<i>gig on that stage
for 20 some years.</i>

42:46.730 --> 42:48.399
<i>Yeah, and my daddy</i>

42:48.399 --> 42:52.695
<i>watched him as a boy
from that doorway right there.</i>

42:52.695 --> 42:54.697
<i>Said a bartender, at the time,</i>

42:54.697 --> 42:59.410
<i>gave him a tall, cold drink
filled with maraschino cherries.</i>

43:00.786 --> 43:03.414
<i>And the owner of the club
at that time,</i>

43:03.414 --> 43:05.833
<i>the man you purchased it from,</i>

43:05.833 --> 43:07.918
<i>knocked that drink out of
my daddy's hands.</i>

43:07.918 --> 43:09.587
<i>So while I understand</i>

43:09.587 --> 43:11.589
<i>this club is important
to you, Richard,</i>

43:11.589 --> 43:14.341
<i>it's important to me, too.</i>

43:18.637 --> 43:20.598
<i>slow, dramatic music</i>

43:23.892 --> 43:25.936
<i>Congratulations.</i>

43:25.936 --> 43:27.980
<i>I look forward to seeing
what you do with the place.</i>

43:27.980 --> 43:30.149
<i>Well, there'll always be a table
for the mayor inside.</i>

43:57.509 --> 43:59.053
<i>They delivered
your laundry downstairs</i>

43:59.053 --> 44:01.764
<i>and I figured
I'd bring it up to you.</i>

44:01.764 --> 44:03.682
<i>You don't need
to check in on me.</i>

44:05.351 --> 44:06.727
<i>May I come in?</i>

44:12.149 --> 44:13.984
<i>I don't understand.</i>

44:13.984 --> 44:15.986
<i>There are maids
who clean for you.</i>

44:15.986 --> 44:17.946
<i>I don't want them
in here every day.</i>

44:17.946 --> 44:20.491
<i>Well, once a week
would be a good start.</i>

44:20.491 --> 44:21.909
<i>You know,
this is why I live here.</i>

44:21.909 --> 44:23.661
<i>To get away from
your constant hovering.</i>

44:23.661 --> 44:24.995
Yes, I know,

44:24.995 --> 44:26.622
<i>moving out of
your parent's house</i>

44:26.622 --> 44:28.248
<i>and into their hotel,</i>

44:28.248 --> 44:30.334
<i>you're the model
of an independent woman.</i>

44:30.334 --> 44:32.503
<i>Just like Eloise at the Plaza...</i>

44:32.503 --> 44:34.838
<i>if Eloise's boyfriend
was murdered downstairs.</i>

44:34.838 --> 44:36.006
<i>I don't like that talk.</i>

44:36.006 --> 44:37.508
<i>Yeah, no shit.</i>

44:37.508 --> 44:39.176
<i>You hurt your father
when you ignore him.</i>

44:40.386 --> 44:42.262
<i>I didn't have the energy
to deal with him.</i>

44:42.262 --> 44:45.432
<i>No? Well, would you dig
a little deeper next time?</i>

44:45.432 --> 44:47.101
<i>We are all trying very hard.</i>

44:47.101 --> 44:49.186
<i>I don't understand why
you insist on punishing us.</i>

44:49.186 --> 44:50.521
<i>You know what?</i>

44:50.521 --> 44:51.522
<i>Climb down off
the fucking cross,</i>

44:51.522 --> 44:52.690
<i>Jesus needs it back.</i>

45:05.577 --> 45:07.663
<i>I owe you all an apology.</i>

45:08.914 --> 45:11.375
<i>I've been coming here
for the wrong reasons.</i>

45:13.377 --> 45:17.047
<i>You told me there were
five stages of grief.</i>

45:17.047 --> 45:20.926
<i>Uh, denial, anger, bargaining,</i>

45:20.926 --> 45:25.097
<i>depression and acceptance.</i>

45:25.097 --> 45:28.642
<i>What I didn't realize
is that my grieving</i>

45:28.642 --> 45:31.437
<i>is out of order.</i>

45:31.437 --> 45:33.981
<i>And that confused me.</i>

45:33.981 --> 45:35.983
<i>That is very astute, Gina.</i>

45:35.983 --> 45:38.193
<i>You're absolutely right.</i>

45:38.193 --> 45:41.447
<i>We all take a different path
to acceptance.</i>

45:41.447 --> 45:44.825
<i>Well, that's what I've learned,
I'm not seeking acceptance.</i>

45:45.784 --> 45:47.745
<i>That's not where
I want to end up.</i>

45:49.288 --> 45:52.583
<i>You were trying to help me
navigate past anger,</i>

45:52.583 --> 45:56.170
<i>but anger is where
I want to live.</i>

45:58.422 --> 46:00.716
<i>Anger is where I flourish.</i>

46:25.157 --> 46:27.409
<i>Thank you for coming back.</i>

46:27.409 --> 46:29.578
<i>I don't know why I'm here.</i>

46:29.578 --> 46:32.498
<i>I do.
To feel closer to Adam.</i>

46:32.498 --> 46:34.917
<i>I won't.</i>

46:34.917 --> 46:37.085
<i>You might.</i>

46:38.879 --> 46:40.631
<i>I need to show you something.</i>

46:57.523 --> 46:59.483
<i>Come on in.</i>

47:00.400 --> 47:02.402
<i>gentle, optimistic music</i>

47:40.899 --> 47:43.861
<i>This is Rocco Adam Baxter.</i>

47:45.654 --> 47:46.905
<i>He's your grandson.</i>
