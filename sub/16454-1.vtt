01:01.750 --> 01:03.753
...Royal Dutch Shell recently
saying it would lay off

01:03.903 --> 01:06.069
10,000 workers as it mergers with BG Group,

01:06.230 --> 01:09.400
but that it will at least maintain
its payout this year.

01:09.550 --> 01:11.640
BP, Exxon Mobil, Conoco,
Phillips, and Chevron...

01:11.790 --> 01:14.400
- It's open.
- ...have all taken similar steps to...

01:17.230 --> 01:20.348
Hey, Patrick, good to see you.

01:20.510 --> 01:22.229
- Good to see you.
- Thanks, sit down.

01:25.710 --> 01:26.780
Help yourself.

01:26.990 --> 01:29.027
I'm grand, thanks, grand.

01:32.910 --> 01:36.984
So, I spoke to Michael Arndt, SEC compliance.

01:37.910 --> 01:40.379
He says you're four to three
at the moment, it looks good.

01:40.670 --> 01:42.627
All right, anyone with him?

01:42.830 --> 01:45.470
Yeah, all except Patricia Warren.

01:45.630 --> 01:48.304
- Well, that's a pity.
- No, no, he says she's, you know...

01:49.790 --> 01:50.860
flexible.

01:51.510 --> 01:54.628
Just needs a little nudge, right direction.

01:56.230 --> 01:57.346
She's yours.

01:58.230 --> 01:59.380
It's a done deal.

01:59.550 --> 02:01.143
You've got the SEC in your pocket, Mike.

02:01.310 --> 02:02.926
Thanks a million.

02:05.230 --> 02:06.630
Self-made aviation tycoon...

02:06.790 --> 02:11.148
...Mike Regan, is taking his private
jet business to an even higher altitude.

02:11.310 --> 02:14.621
The latest development,
Regan is taking his company public.

02:14.950 --> 02:16.100
So will investors bite?

02:16.270 --> 02:18.501
This is Marketplace, I'm Kai Ryssdal.

02:18.710 --> 02:22.704
Here's one for you, Mike Regan, a 52-year
old owner of the private jet business

02:22.870 --> 02:25.749
that bears his name is about
to take his company public.

02:25.910 --> 02:28.345
He's launching an app
for millionaires, I suppose,

02:28.550 --> 02:32.062
that'll let 'em book a jet the same way
you and I would book an Uber.

02:32.230 --> 02:34.108
Is it gonna work? I have no idea.

02:34.310 --> 02:36.745
He needs cash and some
deep-pocketed investors,

02:36.910 --> 02:38.947
but they are his regular customers.

02:39.110 --> 02:43.428
Not to be left out, Regan needs
the SEC to sign off on that IPO.

02:43.750 --> 02:45.423
On to aviation news now.

02:45.590 --> 02:48.150
Private jet maverick,
Michael Regan, is set to go before

02:48.310 --> 02:51.303
the U.S. Securities and
Exchange Commission next week.

02:51.670 --> 02:55.546
He's seeking the green light to bring
his private aviation company public.

02:55.710 --> 02:58.748
Will it work? The SEC will decide soon.

02:59.470 --> 03:01.348
Frequently sought, leaving...

03:14.190 --> 03:16.341
- Hey.
- Hi, Rusty.

03:19.230 --> 03:20.550
How'd it go?

03:21.430 --> 03:22.910
Yeah, all's good, all's good.

03:23.110 --> 03:24.430
Aren't you gonna head to school today?

03:24.590 --> 03:25.501
Mm-hm.

03:25.910 --> 03:28.481
Just one more cup before I face the kids.

03:29.910 --> 03:31.910
- Morning, sunshine.
- Hey.

03:32.150 --> 03:33.220
Hey.

03:34.070 --> 03:37.142
Hey, whatever happened
to "Good morning, Daddy"?

03:37.870 --> 03:39.350
I'm not a little girl anymore.

03:40.430 --> 03:43.022
Oh, no? Who told you that?

03:48.870 --> 03:51.624
Okay, can I just get a coffee pot for myself?

03:51.790 --> 03:54.566
Just my own coffee pot? That'd be great.

03:58.170 --> 04:00.940
Would you look at that?
You're an amazing woman.

04:01.110 --> 04:02.988
- It's easy.
- Hey, can I get a new phone?

04:04.190 --> 04:06.341
Oh, sure. What color would you like?

04:06.950 --> 04:09.260
Really? Because Lance has the...

04:11.030 --> 04:12.749
Hilarious.

04:12.950 --> 04:15.811
- All right, Lance is here, I gotta go.
- Mm-mm, finish your breakfast.

04:15.961 --> 04:18.184
- No, I got school, I gotta go.
- Finish your breakfast.

04:18.870 --> 04:19.940
Hey!

04:20.350 --> 04:21.863
Dad, can you have someone fix the wifi?

04:22.029 --> 04:23.146
It's crazy slow.

04:23.310 --> 04:25.859
- That is not okay.
- She's 17.

04:26.750 --> 04:29.344
I'm gonna grab a shower.
Then I'm gonna jump straight into this thing.

04:29.550 --> 04:34.790
I gotta go, but I'll kiss you,
forever and a day.

04:35.070 --> 04:36.106
See ya.

04:36.350 --> 04:39.789
It's a real rags-to-riches story
and investors, they want in on this.

04:39.950 --> 04:41.270
Well, you've said that if the SEC

04:41.430 --> 04:44.582
approves the initial public offering,
the company is going to be valued

04:44.750 --> 04:46.389
in the hundreds of millions of dollars.

04:46.550 --> 04:48.223
How will Regan generate earnings?

04:48.590 --> 04:50.070
Well, there's an app for that.

04:50.230 --> 04:52.967
Regan has what I think is a genius...

05:13.790 --> 05:15.224
Good morning, everyone.

05:16.270 --> 05:20.423
My name is Mike Regan. I own this company.

05:21.670 --> 05:23.263
Now, I know you're all here

05:23.430 --> 05:27.470
to listen to me talk about
this brilliant app we've invented.

05:27.830 --> 05:29.025
But, right now,

05:30.590 --> 05:32.900
I want to talk about flying.

05:34.950 --> 05:39.069
Frank, you took your first solo flight at 16,

05:39.230 --> 05:42.507
single-engine ticket at 17, am I right?

05:42.830 --> 05:46.380
Alan, certified at multi's at 22,

05:46.910 --> 05:48.867
and jets at 28.

05:49.470 --> 05:51.029
And then we have Lizzy here,

05:51.550 --> 05:55.510
the first female G550 driver.

05:56.670 --> 06:00.789
We love to fly, it's the freedom of it all.

06:02.070 --> 06:03.265
It changes you.

06:03.430 --> 06:06.025
You're not fixed on the ground
like some rock.

06:06.230 --> 06:07.903
You're as free as you'll ever be.

06:10.110 --> 06:12.741
But it's expensive, isn't it?

06:15.390 --> 06:19.424
I'm gonna take this business
and blow it up and invent a new one.

06:20.610 --> 06:22.329
Let me show you the future.

06:29.310 --> 06:30.790
Private aviation.

06:30.950 --> 06:33.624
What if it could be made even more efficient?

06:33.790 --> 06:36.350
What if your investment
could be put to work for you?

06:37.590 --> 06:41.140
What if there was a way
to make your jet work for you?

06:41.350 --> 06:42.784
Now, there is.

06:42.950 --> 06:47.246
Introducing the Omni Jet
mobile app from Regan Aviation.

06:47.810 --> 06:51.221
Omni tracks over 15,000 private
and corporate jet aircraft

06:51.390 --> 06:54.144
in real time, and matches your needs

06:54.310 --> 06:57.587
with available aircraft
every second of ev-day...

07:01.660 --> 07:02.855
Fuck.

07:05.350 --> 07:06.306
Joan?

07:08.150 --> 07:09.300
I'll just be a moment.

07:10.070 --> 07:11.709
Best laid plans.

07:13.190 --> 07:15.341
It's too early in the morning
for cocktails, I think.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.861
So, not the start I was hoping for.

07:19.830 --> 07:22.023
- Andy!
- I know, I'm working it at this end.

07:22.190 --> 07:23.465
Grab the temp guy.

07:23.870 --> 07:25.065
I need you.

07:30.030 --> 07:32.306
I'm sorry it's taking so long, Mr. Regan.

07:36.830 --> 07:38.184
Technology, eh?

07:39.070 --> 07:40.299
Yeah.

07:47.830 --> 07:50.584
There you go, you're back up.

07:51.070 --> 07:53.982
Well, now, that was fun.

07:57.150 --> 07:58.425
Good, very good.

07:58.630 --> 07:59.780
Very, very, very good.

08:00.590 --> 08:03.549
Now, let's talk about Omni.

08:13.990 --> 08:15.219
How do you think it went?

08:15.910 --> 08:17.105
Home run...

08:18.590 --> 08:19.819
despite the glitch.

08:22.670 --> 08:24.184
I hope so, Joan.

08:26.270 --> 08:27.340
We need this.

08:29.150 --> 08:30.186
Need it?

08:31.150 --> 08:32.220
Need it.

08:34.390 --> 08:35.870
Grab Sully, will you?

08:36.309 --> 08:37.869
We need to go over the IPO.

08:38.549 --> 08:39.620
Yeah.

08:46.470 --> 08:49.747
All right, Dave, thank you.
Good night, good work, travel safe.

08:49.910 --> 08:51.026
Goodnight, Mike.

08:57.350 --> 08:59.307
- Hey.
- Sorry. I'm sorry, Mr. Regan.

09:00.910 --> 09:02.708
Hey, you're the I.T. guy, right?

09:04.190 --> 09:06.705
- Yeah, that's right, Ed Porter.
- Yeah, Mike Regan.

09:06.910 --> 09:09.061
You really saved my ass
in there today, thanks.

09:09.230 --> 09:10.459
- Yeah, yeah.
- You're new?

09:10.630 --> 09:11.780
Yeah, just a temp.

09:11.950 --> 09:13.270
Okay, well, we'll try and fix that.

09:13.430 --> 09:14.705
- Okay? See you tomorrow.
- Thanks.

09:15.870 --> 09:18.669
Hey, listen, can I ask you something?

09:18.910 --> 09:20.788
Are you doing anything over the weekend?

09:22.590 --> 09:23.580
No, I'm pretty free.

09:23.750 --> 09:26.585
Good, maybe you can come over to our
house, have a look at our internet?

09:26.750 --> 09:28.343
My daughter's complaining about it.

09:28.710 --> 09:29.939
- Would that be okay?
- Not a problem.

09:30.110 --> 09:31.942
Okay, Joan'll give you the address tomorrow.

09:32.110 --> 09:33.510
Good night...

09:33.910 --> 09:35.344
Ed.

09:35.510 --> 09:37.547
Ed, goodnight, good man.

10:29.510 --> 10:31.661
- Hello?
- Err, Ed Porter, ma'am.

10:32.190 --> 10:33.510
I'm sorry, who?

10:34.110 --> 10:37.103
Err... Ed Porter, I'm the I.T. guy.

10:37.350 --> 10:40.149
Oh, yeah, come on... Come in, come in.

10:40.310 --> 10:41.949
Sorry, sweetie, come on up.

11:00.550 --> 11:02.621
Wow, she's beautiful.

11:02.790 --> 11:04.270
Hey, climb in.

11:04.830 --> 11:06.025
Sit yourself down.

11:13.390 --> 11:14.665
New car smell.

11:14.870 --> 11:16.623
I feel like a kid with a new toy.

11:17.190 --> 11:18.340
I can't stop playing with it.

11:18.630 --> 11:20.620
Check out this NAV system.

11:20.770 --> 11:23.703
You see that? It's like a bloody Gulfstream.

11:24.990 --> 11:26.140
Yeah, not bad.

11:26.630 --> 11:28.747
Not bad? What are you saying?

11:29.070 --> 11:31.665
I mean, it's great, it's top of the line...

11:32.190 --> 11:33.544
for civilian stuff.

11:34.430 --> 11:35.659
So you got something better then?

11:37.110 --> 11:39.625
Oh, yeah. I've got something way better.

11:41.350 --> 11:43.228
You know, but it's... it's third party.

11:47.350 --> 11:49.819
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Should we be doing this?

11:50.030 --> 11:51.180
Eh...

11:51.350 --> 11:52.306
No.

11:54.070 --> 11:56.380
Come on, Mike, you're a pilot, this is DC.

11:56.870 --> 11:59.101
You know the military spec
stuff that's out there.

11:59.350 --> 12:00.340
Huh.

12:03.110 --> 12:05.341
I mean, this talks to you,
like the civilian stuff.

12:05.510 --> 12:07.103
Tells you which turns to take, all that.

12:07.750 --> 12:10.629
But it's a mil-spec network.
USG satellite coverage.

12:10.790 --> 12:12.941
You know, faster real time, never glitches.

12:13.950 --> 12:15.100
You'll love it.

12:15.470 --> 12:17.826
All right, well,
just don't void the warranty.

12:21.670 --> 12:22.626
System upgraded.

12:22.790 --> 12:25.383
- Yeah, buddy.
- Nice one.

12:25.590 --> 12:26.467
All right.

12:26.630 --> 12:28.064
Yeah. You're welcome.

12:30.390 --> 12:33.588
I've gotta say, Mike,
you've got a lot of old stuff here

12:33.750 --> 12:35.628
for a new-build, seriously.

12:36.710 --> 12:39.589
Where the hell were you when
my tech team was building the app?

12:40.550 --> 12:42.428
I was working for someone else.

12:45.230 --> 12:47.267
Say, can I get your wi-fi password?

12:47.830 --> 12:50.664
It's just reganhome1.

12:52.310 --> 12:53.664
- One word?
- Yeah.

12:55.070 --> 12:56.265
Who were you working for?

12:56.470 --> 12:57.745
The government.

12:59.510 --> 13:00.626
Really?

13:01.750 --> 13:03.309
Is that where you learned your stuff?

13:03.870 --> 13:07.102
Mostly. I was recruited
straight out of college.

13:07.430 --> 13:10.229
No shit. To do what?

13:10.670 --> 13:14.027
- Oh, signals, intel stuff.
- Really?

13:14.990 --> 13:16.140
What do you mean?

13:16.430 --> 13:18.342
I'm not really supposed to talk about it.

13:19.950 --> 13:21.066
Got it.

13:21.430 --> 13:23.422
Hey, you know that the smart panels
in your home

13:23.590 --> 13:25.866
have got built-in cameras, right?

13:26.030 --> 13:28.261
Yeah, I had 'em disabled.

13:29.630 --> 13:30.905
I like my privacy.

13:31.070 --> 13:32.789
Privacy's over, Mike.

13:33.230 --> 13:34.505
It's a whole new world now.

13:34.670 --> 13:36.901
Well, I'll hold onto it for as long as I can.

13:37.470 --> 13:38.904
All right, good luck with that.

13:39.590 --> 13:40.706
What do you mean?

13:42.070 --> 13:44.710
Privacy isn't a right, it's a privilege.

13:45.670 --> 13:46.626
You're not serious?

13:46.790 --> 13:50.386
The U.S. Constitution contains
no expressed right to privacy.

13:50.550 --> 13:51.666
Really?

13:51.830 --> 13:55.109
First amendment, privacy of the home,
third amendment, privacy of the person,

13:55.270 --> 13:58.183
fourth and fifth, privilege
against self-incrimination,

13:58.350 --> 14:00.148
but nowhere does it say,

14:00.310 --> 14:02.461
"You have the inalienable right to privacy."

14:02.630 --> 14:04.383
Well, I'm talking about
all this internet stuff.

14:05.350 --> 14:08.909
All this crap where I can't take a shit
without someone's opinion, you know?

14:09.230 --> 14:10.266
You know, what I mean is,

14:10.430 --> 14:12.706
I don't think it's making
anyone's life better.

14:14.750 --> 14:18.141
Well, I guess it just depends on what
your life was to begin with, you know?

14:21.550 --> 14:22.904
I'll be back in a jiffy.

14:23.070 --> 14:25.582
I just gotta get something from my car.

15:27.830 --> 15:29.503
Well, that's just about everything.

15:29.710 --> 15:32.270
It all should be running much
faster and smoother by now.

15:32.790 --> 15:35.100
Good, really appreciate it, Ed.

15:38.190 --> 15:39.260
You know Rose.

15:40.230 --> 15:41.710
This is our daughter, Kaitlyn.

15:41.870 --> 15:42.986
- Hi.
- Hey.

15:43.670 --> 15:47.141
Honey, this is Ed, our new IT guy.

15:47.590 --> 15:49.866
- Nice to meet you, Ed.
- Nice to meet you, too, Rose.

15:51.190 --> 15:52.829
Come, relax, join us.

15:53.230 --> 15:55.904
Well, I should probably get going,
my girlfriend...

15:56.110 --> 15:59.103
Ah, come on, let's have a drink.

16:00.070 --> 16:02.585
Just one. There you go.
Kaitlyn, watch the steaks.

16:02.750 --> 16:04.070
Come on, good man.

16:06.630 --> 16:07.950
Enjoy.

16:18.350 --> 16:20.467
You have a beautiful home, Mike.

16:23.150 --> 16:24.630
Beautiful payments, too.

16:25.870 --> 16:30.306
Tell me something, did you really learn
all your stuff from the government?

16:31.910 --> 16:33.947
- I was with the NSA.
- No shit?

16:34.390 --> 16:35.540
- The NSA?
- Yeah.

16:35.750 --> 16:38.868
Hang on, picture of me here in Kandahar.

16:40.510 --> 16:41.705
Would you look at that.

16:42.830 --> 16:43.946
Why'd you leave?

16:45.110 --> 16:46.624
Oh, you see things, and...

16:47.190 --> 16:48.590
I don't like talking about it.

16:48.790 --> 16:49.985
It's crazy, what they do.

16:53.030 --> 16:56.546
Ed, that presentation you came in
and saved the other day?

16:57.150 --> 16:58.106
Your Omni app?

16:58.270 --> 17:00.660
- Yeah, I signed the NDA.
- Yeah, I know, I know.

17:00.870 --> 17:05.626
Well, when that thing goes,
I'm gonna need guys like you.

17:07.030 --> 17:09.829
And there's great opportunities
to be had, I promise you.

17:11.150 --> 17:12.220
So...

17:13.790 --> 17:14.906
stick around, Ed.

17:15.550 --> 17:16.950
I hear you, I will.

17:19.230 --> 17:22.230
Channel 5 Weather Center just to update
you on the line of severe thunderstorms

17:22.390 --> 17:24.984
that extends from up near Sherman
to about Denton,

17:25.150 --> 17:26.664
then down to the north and west.

19:10.510 --> 19:12.103
You're in a precarious situation, Mike.

19:12.990 --> 19:14.140
You're overextended.

19:15.110 --> 19:16.100
I know.

19:16.590 --> 19:19.185
You need capital to finance the Omni project,

19:19.470 --> 19:21.223
which is what your investors are for.

19:21.550 --> 19:22.700
Securitized loans.

19:23.230 --> 19:26.826
Now, if the SEC approve them,
you launch your IPO.

19:27.350 --> 19:29.103
If they don't, you have to liquidate,

19:29.270 --> 19:31.466
and your fleet goes to auction
for pennies on the dollar.

19:32.590 --> 19:34.070
What does your gut say?

19:37.390 --> 19:39.461
The SEC sent me a preliminary report.

19:39.870 --> 19:42.101
I think we're on firm ground, it's just...

19:43.150 --> 19:45.142
they'll issue the final decision very soon.

19:45.750 --> 19:47.025
So we're good then?

19:47.550 --> 19:49.542
Unless something new comes to light, yeah.

19:50.950 --> 19:52.384
It won't, will it, Mike?

19:53.030 --> 19:54.146
No.

19:55.550 --> 19:56.666
That's everything.

19:59.430 --> 20:00.341
- Good morning.
- Good morning, Mr. Regan.

20:00.510 --> 20:02.747
Can you put this on my desk, please?
Thank you. Good morning.

20:02.910 --> 20:04.264
- Good morning, Mr. Regan.
- I'm coming.

20:04.430 --> 20:06.387
I'll do that right away.
Yeah, I'll see you at three.

20:06.990 --> 20:09.664
- Andy, good morning to you.
- Hey, Mike.

20:11.230 --> 20:12.630
- It's all good?
- We're good.

20:12.790 --> 20:14.543
Hot-shot here defragged it.

20:14.710 --> 20:16.303
Your boy Ed knows his stuff.

20:16.510 --> 20:18.467
Glad to hear it. Good man, Ed.

20:18.790 --> 20:19.826
Thank you.

20:20.630 --> 20:22.064
Come on, Andy, smile.

20:22.230 --> 20:24.028
Come on now, there you go, Andy.

20:58.830 --> 21:00.662
Yeah, really.

21:03.390 --> 21:04.426
Yeah.

21:04.670 --> 21:05.547
Let me show you this.

21:05.750 --> 21:08.060
All right, let's see
what you're looking at here.

21:08.230 --> 21:09.346
Are you trying to get me drunk?

21:09.550 --> 21:12.110
Yes. Yes, I am. How did you know?

22:32.230 --> 22:33.459
Yep. I got it.

22:36.990 --> 22:38.344
Evening, Mike.

22:38.990 --> 22:40.060
Ed?

22:42.790 --> 22:44.110
What are you doing here, Ed?

22:45.670 --> 22:48.026
Err, Kaitlyn, she... she texted me.

22:48.230 --> 22:49.664
Well, if she did, she...

22:50.630 --> 22:52.030
she made a mistake.

22:52.230 --> 22:53.300
This is family friends.

22:55.030 --> 22:56.066
Oh.

22:57.390 --> 22:59.746
Oh, I'm sorry, um...
Take the wine, it's from Spain.

22:59.950 --> 23:00.940
No thanks.

23:03.470 --> 23:05.462
I should probably...
I should probably get going.

23:08.510 --> 23:09.739
Have a good night.

23:22.270 --> 23:23.863
- Who was it?
- Nobody.

23:25.750 --> 23:29.588
Kate, you can't invite people to dinner
without asking me or your mother first.

23:29.750 --> 23:30.866
Are we clear?

23:31.750 --> 23:33.821
Invite who? I didn't invite anybody.

23:34.310 --> 23:35.790
Is everybody okay for drinks?

23:35.950 --> 23:37.384
- Are we okay?
- Yeah.

26:39.390 --> 26:41.302
Come on, Kaitlyn, Katie!

26:41.590 --> 26:42.785
- Hey.
- Katie!

26:47.230 --> 26:49.586
- You gotta be kidding me.
- Do not make a scene.

26:56.870 --> 26:59.180
Wow, they're playing great, huh?

26:59.550 --> 27:00.540
Right?

27:01.710 --> 27:03.144
What are you doing here, Ed?

27:04.310 --> 27:05.790
Oh, Kaitlyn asked me online.

27:07.190 --> 27:08.260
Yeah.

27:08.430 --> 27:10.501
What, you two are talking together online?

27:11.150 --> 27:14.063
Yeah, yeah. She just said,
"Come see my team play."

27:14.550 --> 27:15.620
Here I am.

27:18.910 --> 27:19.866
Yeah!

27:20.830 --> 27:22.469
You're getting very good at this, sweetheart.

27:22.670 --> 27:24.627
- You really are, honey.
- Thank you.

27:26.870 --> 27:28.543
Hey, you guys did great out there.

27:28.750 --> 27:29.945
Ed!

27:30.110 --> 27:31.260
Hey.

27:31.550 --> 27:33.269
- Are you hungry?
- Yeah, I'm starving.

27:33.470 --> 27:34.984
Good, let's go get something to eat.

27:35.150 --> 27:36.823
Sounds great.

27:37.470 --> 27:40.702
Ed, this is a kind of family thing.

27:40.870 --> 27:43.783
You know what I mean?
Sunday, dinner, that kind of thing.

27:43.950 --> 27:46.465
- Oh, sure.
- Hey, and thanks for stopping by.

27:46.710 --> 27:48.508
See you at work. Bye, Rose.

27:48.670 --> 27:50.104
- Kaitlyn.
- Bye.

27:50.270 --> 27:51.420
Enjoy your dinner!

27:51.590 --> 27:53.070
I don't know why
you had to be so mean to him.

27:53.230 --> 27:55.028
- I am not being mean to him.
- He could've come.

27:55.190 --> 27:56.909
I'm just setting boundaries, that's all.

27:57.070 --> 27:58.663
He works for me, he's not family.

27:58.870 --> 28:00.270
Okay, well, I think he's nice.

28:00.430 --> 28:01.784
Yeah, and he's a lot older than you.

28:01.950 --> 28:04.704
- He's 28, he told me.
- And you're 17.

30:07.590 --> 30:09.263
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:16.230 --> 30:18.426
- Something wrong?
- No, nothing.

30:20.550 --> 30:22.826
I got the mammogram today,
you know I hate them.

30:23.550 --> 30:24.620
I do.

30:25.910 --> 30:29.062
But it's always fine and you're always fine.

30:29.310 --> 30:30.426
I know.

30:31.350 --> 30:32.500
I love you.

30:35.870 --> 30:37.020
And I love you.

30:52.870 --> 30:56.022
- Dare you to do it.
- Oh, my God, maybe I guess.

30:56.670 --> 30:57.945
Hey, what are you doing this weekend?

30:58.110 --> 31:00.504
Well what do you think?
I thought we were going to that party.

31:01.590 --> 31:04.423
That's what I want to do. I don't
want to sit around, I want to go out.

31:04.590 --> 31:05.660
Hey!

31:05.950 --> 31:06.940
Kaitlyn!

31:08.070 --> 31:09.220
Ed?

31:09.390 --> 31:10.380
Hey.

31:11.070 --> 31:12.663
Come on, jump in, I'll give you a ride home.

31:12.830 --> 31:15.749
- Hey, how do you... Where did you...
- She's fine, I'm giving her a ride.

31:21.270 --> 31:22.943
Sure, why not?

31:24.470 --> 31:25.620
Text me later.

31:28.870 --> 31:29.940
Bye.

31:30.950 --> 31:32.543
Bye, later, friend-o.

31:51.350 --> 31:54.548
So, was that guy your boyfriend?

31:56.470 --> 31:57.586
Sort of.

31:58.350 --> 31:59.386
Uh-huh.

32:00.670 --> 32:02.468
He seems a little immature for you.

32:04.190 --> 32:06.341
We grew up together, so...

32:08.470 --> 32:10.621
We're mostly just friends.

32:11.030 --> 32:12.589
So you haven't had sex yet?

32:14.790 --> 32:16.110
Wouldn't you like to know?

32:20.510 --> 32:22.710
Your dad'd kill me.

32:35.350 --> 32:38.149
Major stock market indexes are higher today.

32:38.430 --> 32:39.760
Investors are focusing on companies
that beat...

32:39.910 --> 32:41.026
Oh, boy-o.

32:41.190 --> 32:42.146
...their earnings estimates.

32:42.310 --> 32:46.589
The Lunberg 991 Washington DC index
is up one percent, a good...

32:46.750 --> 32:48.264
Ah, you little shit!

33:02.510 --> 33:03.944
He's out back, go talk to him.

33:07.630 --> 33:10.145
Dad, Ed got me the new phone.

33:10.710 --> 33:12.429
Yeah, I get 'em for practically nothing, I...

33:12.590 --> 33:14.866
- Dude, let's have a chat.
- Something, something wrong?

33:15.030 --> 33:16.544
- You can't give my daughter a phone.
- Dad!

33:16.710 --> 33:17.746
You can't give her a ride, either.

33:17.910 --> 33:19.060
- Dad, that's so...
- Just be quiet.

33:19.230 --> 33:20.141
- He's being nice!
- She asked me to.

33:20.310 --> 33:21.744
- Why do you take his side?
- I don't care! Okay?

33:21.910 --> 33:22.946
What is the problem? He's trying to be nice!

33:23.110 --> 33:24.829
- It's just a phone.
- No, it's not.

33:25.030 --> 33:27.101
I mean, why are we even
having this conversation?

33:27.270 --> 33:28.943
I don't know, I didn't do anything wrong.

33:29.110 --> 33:32.467
Ed, boy-o, this isn't working for me.

33:32.870 --> 33:36.466
- Mike, we're friends.
- No, no, no. You work for me, okay?

33:36.950 --> 33:40.022
Actually, you know, you don't anymore.

33:40.190 --> 33:42.580
You're out of here, all right?
Tomorrow, clear your desk out.

33:42.750 --> 33:43.786
Mike.

33:44.630 --> 33:46.223
- Good luck, Ed!
- Mike!

33:48.630 --> 33:50.587
Kaitlyn! Let's have a talk here.

33:50.750 --> 33:51.740
You are unbelievable!

33:51.910 --> 33:53.503
Every time I make a fucking
friend, you ruin it!

33:53.670 --> 33:56.663
- Don't swear at me!
- I hate living here!

36:10.870 --> 36:12.270
You said ten o'clock, right?

36:12.990 --> 36:14.140
It's the SEC, Mike.

36:14.310 --> 36:16.461
Relax, we're in good shape.

36:16.630 --> 36:17.950
Yeah, yeah.

36:19.670 --> 36:20.740
Omni?

36:22.870 --> 36:26.102
I'm Linda Martinez, SEC Fraud Division.

36:26.270 --> 36:28.307
- What?
- We have an issue.

36:29.510 --> 36:31.229
As you are no doubt aware, Mr. Regan,

36:31.390 --> 36:34.224
under Section 4 of the SEC
Compliance Regulations,

36:34.430 --> 36:36.467
any attempt to lobby, coerce, or collaborate

36:36.630 --> 36:38.428
with any member of the compliance committee

36:38.590 --> 36:42.783
will trigger an investigation and a subsequent
delay to any initial public offering.

36:42.950 --> 36:45.146
Well, clearly it wouldn't be
in my client's best interest to...

36:45.310 --> 36:47.302
We have received evidence
of such collaboration.

36:47.790 --> 36:51.101
We've also received evidence
of electronic document tampering.

36:51.590 --> 36:52.819
Look, um...

36:53.030 --> 36:55.420
I'm prepared to resubmit the
documents in question here and now.

36:55.590 --> 36:58.709
We have therefore no other choice
than to delay or suspend your application

36:58.910 --> 37:00.230
for an initial public offering.

37:00.390 --> 37:01.460
Delay?

37:01.830 --> 37:03.150
By what, a couple of weeks?

37:03.350 --> 37:05.023
- Or months.
- Months!

37:05.270 --> 37:06.670
Are you fucking kidding me?

37:09.590 --> 37:11.582
We'll be in touch. Good day.

37:23.710 --> 37:25.144
Someone's fucking with us.

37:34.830 --> 37:36.742
Oh, my God, my God!

37:49.230 --> 37:50.550
I don't know.

37:50.750 --> 37:53.743
That play was just beyond me, I'm sorry, I...

37:53.910 --> 37:55.264
You hated every minute of it.

37:55.790 --> 37:58.624
Sorry, I want my two hours back.

37:58.790 --> 38:01.021
- You were asleep.
- Yeah.

38:02.990 --> 38:05.310
All right, what's wrong?

38:06.390 --> 38:07.744
- Mike.
- I...

38:08.230 --> 38:09.300
Nothing.

38:09.630 --> 38:11.144
- It's fine.
- What?

38:11.950 --> 38:14.181
- We had to fire that guy.
- What guy?

38:14.350 --> 38:16.740
Ed Porter, the I.T. guy.

38:17.950 --> 38:18.986
The one that came around to the house?

38:19.150 --> 38:20.106
Mm-hm.

38:20.270 --> 38:21.590
Good, he was a creep.

38:25.630 --> 38:28.543
Well, don't worry.

38:28.950 --> 38:30.384
He's long gone.

38:32.630 --> 38:34.064
No, what else? There's something else.

38:34.230 --> 38:36.381
I'm under pressure with the SEC.

38:37.430 --> 38:41.101
We all thought it was going fine,
and it's really just going down the shitter.

38:43.070 --> 38:45.346
- Is it gonna be okay?
- I...

38:46.030 --> 38:47.100
I don't know.

38:48.350 --> 38:49.420
I don't know.

39:20.030 --> 39:21.020
- Mike.
- Wha...

39:21.190 --> 39:22.260
Mike.

39:22.590 --> 39:24.786
Wake up.
I think there's someone in the house.

39:27.456 --> 39:29.421
Door opening.

39:34.670 --> 39:35.740
Stay there.

40:52.670 --> 40:53.660
Mike?

41:01.830 --> 41:02.866
Mike!

41:07.470 --> 41:09.621
Come on, you piece of fucking shit!

41:10.310 --> 41:11.300
Fuck!

41:11.670 --> 41:13.070
Fuck!

41:14.110 --> 41:15.180
Turn off!

41:27.030 --> 41:28.908
System set.

41:35.670 --> 41:37.627
- What was that?
- It's fine, everything's fine.

41:37.790 --> 41:40.783
No, everything's not fine!
What the fuck was that?

41:40.950 --> 41:43.590
Everything's fine, okay?
Back to bed, everyone, don't worry.

42:23.310 --> 42:26.144
Kaitlyn, I'm sorry about
that craziness last night.

42:26.310 --> 42:28.381
You must be tired.

42:31.670 --> 42:32.626
Morning.

42:32.830 --> 42:35.902
Mike, I've got bad news. We've been hacked.

42:36.470 --> 42:37.506
It looks bad.

42:37.710 --> 42:40.782
We have software glitches
across every single aircraft.

42:40.950 --> 42:42.100
What the f...

42:44.630 --> 42:47.350
I don't know what to tell you, Mike.
He got in somehow.

42:47.550 --> 42:48.904
I already called the police.

42:49.590 --> 42:51.104
Our sales reps are on the phones now,

42:51.270 --> 42:53.421
calling them one at a time
and telling them to ignore the email.

42:53.590 --> 42:55.070
That's fucking great.

42:55.670 --> 42:57.866
It's costing us upward of $1.2 million a day.

42:58.270 --> 43:01.308
What about the emails,
screwing with our clients?

43:02.190 --> 43:04.227
They were definitely
generated from our servers.

43:05.110 --> 43:07.022
They all have our IP address.

43:07.830 --> 43:09.310
Clients think they came from us.

43:10.270 --> 43:11.465
Can we shut him down?

43:13.070 --> 43:17.269
- Who?
- Porter, the guy we fired.

43:17.910 --> 43:20.630
- I don't know.
- Who else could do this?

43:21.710 --> 43:25.581
Yeah, but he had access, so he probably
put a bunch of back doors on the server.

43:25.750 --> 43:27.503
- That's what I'd do.
- Look...

43:28.870 --> 43:33.262
Look, just change everything,
the pass codes, the words.

43:35.030 --> 43:37.784
Do what you guys do. Secure this place.

43:38.150 --> 43:41.587
- Get it done, please!
- Okay, Mike. Let's go, guys.

43:48.230 --> 43:49.710
All right, quiet, everybody!

43:49.950 --> 43:52.226
- Come on, kids. Stay together.
- Make sure you've got everything!

43:52.750 --> 43:54.025
Bye-bye, honey.

44:21.590 --> 44:23.024
You've reached Dr. Francis Klein.

44:23.230 --> 44:25.790
If this is an emergency,
hang up and call 9-1-1.

44:26.390 --> 44:29.302
Otherwise please leave
a message after the tone.

44:29.510 --> 44:33.550
Hi, this is Rose Regan,
I'm a patient of Dr. Klein's.

44:33.710 --> 44:34.780
Can, um...

44:38.430 --> 44:40.740
Can you have him call me
as soon as possible, please?

44:41.350 --> 44:44.741
It's, um...
It's about an email he just sent me.

44:45.070 --> 44:46.299
Thank you.

45:08.870 --> 45:10.509
Would you turn that off, please?

45:16.150 --> 45:21.062
Listen, I'd like everyone
to stay off their smart phones

45:21.230 --> 45:23.825
and their computers for
as much as possible, okay?

45:25.510 --> 45:27.627
- I have a paper to write.
- So write it.

45:28.350 --> 45:29.670
Fine.

45:30.230 --> 45:32.790
Everyone in this fucking house is crazy.

45:45.350 --> 45:46.466
Doctor Klein?

45:47.230 --> 45:48.459
Yeah, gimme a second.

45:54.950 --> 45:57.510
Yeah, I wanted to talk to you
about the email you sent.

45:59.630 --> 46:00.905
The pathology report?

46:03.910 --> 46:07.381
Yes, that I tested positive
for breast cancer.

46:08.830 --> 46:11.265
You do that?
You send that in an email, really?

46:11.430 --> 46:14.943
No, I have your pathology report
right here in front of me. It's negative.

46:15.110 --> 46:18.149
- I was just gonna call you about it, Rose.
- Negative, are you sure?

46:18.310 --> 46:20.950
Yes. Negative. Please don't worry.
You're perfectly fine.

46:21.470 --> 46:22.745
No, thank you. Thank you, Doctor.

46:22.910 --> 46:25.425
I don't know who emailed you what,
but everything looks fine.

46:26.710 --> 46:28.986
Rusty, you okay?

46:31.390 --> 46:32.790
No, I'm not.

46:33.790 --> 46:35.383
I got an email today about the mammogram

46:35.550 --> 46:38.190
and it said that I tested
positive for breast cancer.

46:38.710 --> 46:39.905
Oh, my God.

46:40.430 --> 46:43.025
- Oh, my God.
- No, I'm fine, I spoke to the doctor.

46:43.190 --> 46:44.067
- He said...
- Are you okay?

46:44.230 --> 46:45.744
I'm okay. He said that I'm fine.

46:45.910 --> 46:46.866
- Are you sure?
- He's scaring me, Mike.

46:47.030 --> 46:48.510
It had to be him.

46:50.430 --> 46:51.466
Mike?

46:51.950 --> 46:54.704
Fucker. I'll tear him to pieces, Rose.

46:56.750 --> 46:59.504
I swear to God,
I'll fucking tear him to pieces.

47:19.630 --> 47:21.462
Stay away from me and family, you got it?

47:21.630 --> 47:23.667
You shouldn't fuck over your friends, Mike.

47:24.590 --> 47:27.310
You fucking psycho. I'm not your friend.

47:27.750 --> 47:29.000
I didn't touch your family...

47:29.150 --> 47:30.186
yet.

47:31.950 --> 47:34.545
You try that, I will fucking kill you.

47:34.750 --> 47:35.945
You understand me?

47:36.110 --> 47:37.385
Fuck you, Regan.

47:37.590 --> 47:40.586
I spent my whole life
dealing with bullies like you.

47:40.850 --> 47:44.389
Yeah. "Oh, he's got fucking special
skills! Let's fucking use him!"

47:45.030 --> 47:46.669
You fucking used me, Mike.

47:46.830 --> 47:50.429
I wonder if your clients know what a
two-faced, fucking piece of shit you are.

47:53.870 --> 47:55.509
Tough guy, huh? Huh?

47:55.670 --> 47:59.670
We'll see how tough you are when your
fucking planes start falling out of the sky.

48:00.390 --> 48:03.701
Mike, I've got your whole operation
strung up like a mine field.

48:04.190 --> 48:06.500
- Bullshit.
- You wanna find out?

48:14.750 --> 48:18.107
You stay the fuck away
from my family, you hear me?

48:18.350 --> 48:20.467
Stay the fuck away from my family!

49:03.870 --> 49:05.499
Hey, I got that video.

49:42.270 --> 49:43.386
I'm sorry.

49:43.590 --> 49:46.059
I'm here, Kaitlyn,
my darling girl, I'm so sorry.

49:46.230 --> 49:47.823
I am so sorry, child.

49:47.990 --> 49:50.459
Listen, I tried to warn you, I did.

49:50.630 --> 49:53.748
The pictures you take,
the things that you record,

49:53.910 --> 49:55.469
they can be used to hurt you.

49:55.790 --> 49:57.429
Do you understand?
Do you understand what I'm saying?

49:57.590 --> 50:00.150
Dad, I didn't... I didn't take any pictures.

50:00.510 --> 50:01.660
I took a shower!

50:01.830 --> 50:05.102
Okay, I didn't do any of this! That fucking
creep you let in the house, he did this!

50:05.270 --> 50:07.546
All right, all right, Kaitlyn, that's enough.

50:07.710 --> 50:10.828
No, Dad, this isn't my fault!
This is your fault!

50:11.350 --> 50:13.581
Just... No, go away!

50:13.790 --> 50:15.270
- Kaitlyn...
- Honey, honey?

50:16.350 --> 50:18.387
Great! Great job, Mike.

50:20.150 --> 50:21.379
Don't start.

50:22.590 --> 50:24.309
- Don't start?
- Take her home!

50:24.510 --> 50:25.660
Where are you going?

50:26.370 --> 50:27.320
Mike!

50:46.830 --> 50:48.981
Let me guess, you're on your way?

50:49.270 --> 50:50.863
I'm gonna kill you, Porter.

50:51.110 --> 50:53.102
I am gonna fucking kill you!

50:53.310 --> 50:55.461
Oh, bad move!

50:55.630 --> 50:57.349
Recorded death threat, Michael.

50:57.750 --> 50:59.230
You fucking phoned me!

51:00.510 --> 51:03.981
Hey, Mike, you know
what I learned at the NSA?

51:05.190 --> 51:06.226
Everybody is a liar.

51:06.390 --> 51:08.586
The polished man with the successful business

51:08.750 --> 51:10.309
and the perfect family.

51:10.630 --> 51:13.225
Beautiful wife, beautiful house,
gorgeous daughter.

51:13.430 --> 51:15.069
It's all a fucking lie.

51:15.270 --> 51:17.262
Let's chat about darling little Kaitlyn.

51:17.910 --> 51:19.708
Mm, Kaitlyn, Mike.

51:20.430 --> 51:21.830
Do you think she's still a virgin?

51:21.990 --> 51:23.185
Because, Mike, I have my doubts.

51:24.390 --> 51:25.744
Right, Daddy?

51:27.630 --> 51:29.344
You little fucker.

51:31.950 --> 51:33.748
Don't you fucking go near my daughter!

51:33.950 --> 51:35.145
Oh, they grow up so fast.

51:35.310 --> 51:37.222
- You fucker!
- Don't they, Michael?

51:37.470 --> 51:40.349
Oh, Mike, c'mon. I gave her a life lesson.

51:40.710 --> 51:42.463
You're a dead man, it's as simple as that.

51:42.670 --> 51:43.990
You're a fucking dead man!

51:44.190 --> 51:45.180
I'm a dead man?

51:45.350 --> 51:48.184
Mike, I just don't think
you have it in you to kill anybody.

51:53.790 --> 51:55.065
You just don't have that...

51:56.590 --> 51:58.468
that le... that level of control.

51:58.630 --> 51:59.825
Come on, you little fucker!

52:04.670 --> 52:05.865
I'll fucking kill you!

52:06.070 --> 52:07.982
You're not the master of the universe, Mike.

52:10.710 --> 52:12.508
You're a dead man, Porter!

52:49.470 --> 52:53.066
So, you told the officer
the car went out of control.

52:53.230 --> 52:54.789
He tried to kill me!

52:57.190 --> 52:59.022
What are you gonna do?

52:59.990 --> 53:03.347
Okay, look. The thing is, one of
my detectives was at your company,

53:03.510 --> 53:04.739
took a bunch of statements.

53:04.910 --> 53:09.109
Your I.T. guys were all very eager
to mention Mr. Porter by name.

53:09.390 --> 53:12.110
Yeah, well they worked with him.
I mean, no one liked him.

53:14.710 --> 53:18.590
And there's this SEC investigation
going on with your company.

53:22.110 --> 53:24.545
I'd say you've got a lot
on your plate, Mr. Regan.

53:25.950 --> 53:27.100
Yeah, meaning?

53:27.270 --> 53:31.185
I'd hate for you to go blaming this
poor schmuck for all your problems.

53:31.390 --> 53:33.541
Oh, so I'm the bad guy now,
is that what you're saying?

53:33.710 --> 53:36.305
- No, I didn't say that.
- He tried to kill me!

53:36.750 --> 53:39.862
You have any evidence that he's
actually done any of these things,

53:41.550 --> 53:42.870
Mr. Regan?

53:57.870 --> 53:59.862
- Are you all right?
- No.

54:00.670 --> 54:01.706
You?

54:09.270 --> 54:10.420
What did the cops say?

54:11.310 --> 54:12.664
Are they gonna do anything?

54:13.990 --> 54:15.106
Mike?

54:21.990 --> 54:23.060
Nothing.

54:29.590 --> 54:30.740
I am so sorry.

54:35.310 --> 54:36.664
I love you, Mike.

54:39.630 --> 54:42.099
You're the love of my fucking life,
but I don't want to hear that.

54:43.990 --> 54:45.344
I don't want to hear sorries.

54:46.550 --> 54:49.987
You brought that man into our house,

54:53.270 --> 54:54.704
into our home.

54:59.070 --> 55:00.584
I want you to sort it out.

55:02.710 --> 55:03.780
Yeah.

55:06.070 --> 55:07.186
Fix it.

55:08.990 --> 55:10.140
All right?

55:12.390 --> 55:13.540
Yeah.

55:13.990 --> 55:15.060
Okay?

55:15.670 --> 55:16.740
Fix it.

55:20.510 --> 55:21.910
- I will.
- Promise?

55:22.070 --> 55:23.982
I promise, come here.

55:55.550 --> 55:56.506
Hello?

55:56.670 --> 55:58.662
May I speak to Peter Buck, please?

56:00.870 --> 56:02.623
Yeah, this is... this is Peter Buck.

56:02.790 --> 56:05.180
Peter, this is Mike Regan.

56:06.030 --> 56:07.510
Mike, hey.

56:07.910 --> 56:10.379
Listen, I am sorry to call you so late.

56:11.510 --> 56:12.990
What can I do for you, Mike?

56:13.270 --> 56:16.820
Peter, I need a favor.

56:19.750 --> 56:21.309
Okay. I'm listening.

56:24.030 --> 56:26.909
It's not just online fraud stuff, I get it.

56:27.070 --> 56:30.864
You gotta dig deep and take care
of the problem at its source.

56:31.150 --> 56:33.301
You need someone who can do what he does.

56:33.670 --> 56:34.626
You're being attacked.

56:34.790 --> 56:37.828
You have to look at the true
point of view of an attack.

56:38.070 --> 56:40.904
You've got so many multiple weak spots.

56:41.590 --> 56:43.627
You know, we're not
screwing around here, Mike.

56:43.790 --> 56:45.383
You need to shut this guy down.

56:46.630 --> 56:49.059
Mike, with a guy like this,
you can't just get rid of him, you know?

56:49.270 --> 56:53.020
He's gonna have left time-bombs,
trip-wire emails, the whole lot.

56:53.230 --> 56:54.459
You gotta clean it up.

56:54.910 --> 56:57.345
You can't just, you know, disappear this guy.

56:58.190 --> 57:00.386
We have guys, you know, we have cleaners.

57:00.830 --> 57:02.230
You know, that's what we call them.

57:02.390 --> 57:05.789
State Department, CIA, has different names
for them, but we call them cleaners.

57:07.590 --> 57:10.545
Yeah, there's a... There's a guy
we use at the State Department.

57:10.750 --> 57:12.707
He's sort of off-program.

57:13.070 --> 57:15.539
He might, err... might be what you need.

57:35.430 --> 57:36.830
Peter Bu... I am Henrik.

57:36.990 --> 57:38.902
May I have your cell phone please, Mr. Regan?

57:46.790 --> 57:47.940
Thank you.

57:52.070 --> 57:55.585
Your phone will function
normally in 24 hours.

58:04.150 --> 58:05.300
Shall we get moving?

58:07.070 --> 58:08.220
To your right.

58:17.510 --> 58:19.183
What's gonna happen, Mom?

58:22.310 --> 58:23.539
I don't know.

58:38.390 --> 58:39.710
What are you doing?

58:41.070 --> 58:43.062
I don't want him to see my face.

58:51.430 --> 58:52.546
I'm back!

58:53.470 --> 58:54.824
This is my new friend.

58:55.350 --> 58:57.069
It's okay, it's okay.

58:57.790 --> 58:59.304
He doesn't want Porter to see his face.

59:00.310 --> 59:01.460
Very nice to meet you.

59:02.550 --> 59:03.620
Yeah, thank you.

59:04.710 --> 59:05.826
Nice to meet you.

59:06.750 --> 59:07.900
Hi.

59:08.110 --> 59:09.749
- May I?
- Go ahead.

59:12.670 --> 59:15.742
Very beautiful prison and...

59:18.990 --> 59:21.585
broadcast facility you've built here.

59:26.910 --> 59:28.742
- All the house like this?
- Uh-huh.

59:28.910 --> 59:30.469
- Smart everywhere?
- Yeah.

59:31.070 --> 59:32.265
All the rooms?

59:32.470 --> 59:33.620
Yeah.

59:36.550 --> 59:37.870
How do we start?

59:39.430 --> 59:40.944
We make the house dumb.

59:49.430 --> 59:55.148
Okay, Mr. Regan, the first thing
we do is sterilize you and your family.

59:55.390 --> 59:58.781
We need to do all we can
to scrub you from the web,

59:59.670 --> 01:00:03.983
reduce your footprint
to make you a smaller target.

01:00:04.550 --> 01:00:08.260
Miss Regan, I need everything,
it must be absolute.

01:00:12.670 --> 01:00:13.581
We start with the house.

01:00:13.750 --> 01:00:17.426
We need to make our enemy
deaf, dumb and blind.

01:00:17.590 --> 01:00:18.706
Done.

01:00:43.270 --> 01:00:47.703
I need you to be completely honest
with me or this doesn't work.

01:00:49.070 --> 01:00:52.899
I'm not here to judge, Mr. Regan,
I'm here to fix your problem.

01:00:53.550 --> 01:00:56.304
So, if you've touched a computer
in the last five years...

01:00:56.470 --> 01:00:59.429
...I need to know when, where, and why.

01:01:18.150 --> 01:01:19.664
This might take a while.

01:01:28.470 --> 01:01:29.984
This fucking house.

01:01:33.070 --> 01:01:34.709
It means nothing to me.

01:01:41.750 --> 01:01:43.070
So why did you build it?

01:01:46.910 --> 01:01:48.185
I don't know.

01:01:51.910 --> 01:01:55.187
The only two things I care about
are sleeping in the other room.

01:01:58.070 --> 01:01:59.299
Everything else...

01:02:01.510 --> 01:02:02.944
is just bullshit.

01:02:12.550 --> 01:02:13.540
What?

01:02:15.230 --> 01:02:17.108
His name is not Ed Porter.

01:02:22.950 --> 01:02:27.786
He was born Richard Edward
Portman, Hawthorne, California.

01:02:28.670 --> 01:02:30.946
January 12, 1983.

01:02:32.430 --> 01:02:35.821
Parents divorced, 1986.

01:02:37.230 --> 01:02:39.347
He lives with his mum, moves a lot.

01:02:42.990 --> 01:02:47.269
His father commits suicide, 1989.

01:02:47.830 --> 01:02:50.982
He spent his teenage years
in protective custody.

01:02:51.190 --> 01:02:53.944
His mother was abusive towards him.

01:02:54.110 --> 01:02:55.305
How predictable.

01:02:55.590 --> 01:02:58.230
It would explain his obsession
with you and your family.

01:02:58.510 --> 01:03:04.108
His medical records includes
a wide range of pharmaceuticals:

01:03:05.230 --> 01:03:08.189
Lumictil, Zoloft, Neurontin...

01:03:08.430 --> 01:03:10.422
So... so what are we dealing with here?

01:03:10.630 --> 01:03:12.622
A sociopath, a psychopath?

01:03:12.910 --> 01:03:16.790
He has serious mental health issues.

01:03:17.630 --> 01:03:18.905
Broad spectrum.

01:03:20.190 --> 01:03:21.465
Okay, here we go.

01:03:23.830 --> 01:03:25.742
Ah, as I suspected.

01:03:27.550 --> 01:03:29.223
He never worked for NSA.

01:03:29.750 --> 01:03:32.788
Wait a second, he... he showed me
a photograph of himself

01:03:32.950 --> 01:03:34.748
with these soldiers in Kandahar.

01:03:40.630 --> 01:03:42.144
- This one?
- That's the one.

01:03:42.510 --> 01:03:43.580
Not for real.

01:03:45.550 --> 01:03:46.745
Not a team guy.

01:03:46.910 --> 01:03:50.950
Hired by some NSA subcontractor, 2009.

01:03:51.310 --> 01:03:54.269
Fired for "misuse of proprietary technology."

01:03:54.430 --> 01:03:55.659
Okay, what does that mean?

01:03:56.470 --> 01:04:01.067
Apparently spied on female
co-workers and ex-girlfriends.

01:04:02.350 --> 01:04:06.026
- Jesus.
- Works as an independent IT tech.

01:04:06.510 --> 01:04:07.910
Seven, eight companies.

01:04:08.470 --> 01:04:10.826
No job lasts more than a couple of months.

01:04:11.310 --> 01:04:12.664
Then hired by you.

01:04:13.830 --> 01:04:14.900
Lucky you.

01:04:15.630 --> 01:04:17.622
Look, he's really quite sick,

01:04:17.790 --> 01:04:20.942
but he's also a bad man, Mr. Regan.

01:04:30.190 --> 01:04:32.341
Nice firewall, Mr. Porter.

01:04:33.750 --> 01:04:36.185
Not so clever, not so clever.

01:04:36.830 --> 01:04:38.105
What is it?

01:04:40.190 --> 01:04:41.624
Nothing on his drive.

01:04:43.190 --> 01:04:44.226
So?

01:04:46.190 --> 01:04:48.750
Hackers don't trust the cloud.

01:04:48.990 --> 01:04:50.822
They operate

01:04:51.070 --> 01:04:55.349
from peripherals, thumb drives,

01:04:55.510 --> 01:04:57.820
air-gapped laptops.

01:04:59.110 --> 01:05:00.305
Portable items.

01:05:00.510 --> 01:05:02.502
- Very good news.
- Why?

01:05:02.670 --> 01:05:04.901
We hire someone to break in and take them.

01:05:05.910 --> 01:05:08.186
Good news, you have them in your possession,

01:05:08.470 --> 01:05:10.507
for evidence or to destroy.

01:05:10.790 --> 01:05:11.940
I'll do it.

01:05:12.110 --> 01:05:13.100
Excuse me?

01:05:13.310 --> 01:05:14.539
I'll do the break-in.

01:05:15.030 --> 01:05:17.181
I need everything he's got on me.

01:05:17.830 --> 01:05:21.744
You're a connected man,
Mr. Regan, we hire someone.

01:05:22.190 --> 01:05:24.580
I'm sick and tired of
hiring people to fix my life.

01:05:24.750 --> 01:05:26.264
That's how I got into this mess.

01:05:26.430 --> 01:05:28.501
I'll do this myself, no debate.

01:05:31.990 --> 01:05:33.185
Very well.

01:05:33.350 --> 01:05:34.784
How do we get him out of there?

01:05:37.590 --> 01:05:38.910
Good question.

01:05:40.030 --> 01:05:41.350
She could get him out of there.

01:05:47.470 --> 01:05:49.382
Excuse me, what time do you close tonight?

01:05:49.550 --> 01:05:50.700
We close at 11:00.

01:05:50.870 --> 01:05:51.826
I'm so sorry.

01:05:51.990 --> 01:05:53.026
- Are you okay?
- Yes, sorry.

01:05:53.230 --> 01:05:54.584
Okay. That's okay.

01:05:54.750 --> 01:05:56.264
- What time?
- Um, 11:00.

01:05:56.430 --> 01:05:58.387
Eleven o'clock, thank you very much.

01:06:28.670 --> 01:06:32.710
Okay, now we control her dating app.

01:07:05.670 --> 01:07:07.024
He bought it.

01:07:20.470 --> 01:07:22.985
When you enter, you will trigger his alarm.

01:07:23.350 --> 01:07:26.229
I can silence it,
but it will send him a signal.

01:07:26.830 --> 01:07:29.186
I can delay it as long as practical.

01:07:29.390 --> 01:07:31.507
For this part, we go low tech.

01:07:33.870 --> 01:07:34.860
Good luck.

01:07:39.270 --> 01:07:43.423
Wait for my signal, and remember, Mr. Regan,

01:07:44.030 --> 01:07:45.100
be careful.

01:07:45.630 --> 01:07:46.666
Go.

01:08:02.190 --> 01:08:05.500
In three, two,

01:08:05.950 --> 01:08:06.986
one...

01:08:19.404 --> 01:08:20.673
Oh, shit.

01:08:20.823 --> 01:08:21.939
Wait!

01:08:26.229 --> 01:08:28.767
We're good. Continue.

01:09:11.670 --> 01:09:12.786
He's here.

01:09:24.670 --> 01:09:26.263
As quickly as you can, Mr. Regan.

01:09:26.750 --> 01:09:28.946
Let's go to work. Place the camera.

01:09:33.950 --> 01:09:35.747
Okay, how's this?

01:09:37.390 --> 01:09:38.618
Okay, good.

01:09:40.270 --> 01:09:41.499
Go to his desk.

01:09:42.750 --> 01:09:44.343
I got here as fast as I could.

01:09:49.149 --> 01:09:51.381
Do not touch the computer.

01:09:54.710 --> 01:09:55.700
Err...

01:09:57.150 --> 01:10:00.302
How... how are you? I'm not
actually, um, working right now.

01:10:02.030 --> 01:10:03.703
Oh, that's okay, me neither.

01:10:04.270 --> 01:10:05.704
Under his desk.

01:10:06.910 --> 01:10:08.264
I got your message.

01:10:08.990 --> 01:10:10.709
- Message?
- Yeah, yeah.

01:10:19.110 --> 01:10:21.181
There's nothing. There's nothing here.

01:10:21.990 --> 01:10:23.390
They could be anywhere. There's nothing here.

01:10:23.550 --> 01:10:24.779
It will be in the room.

01:10:25.430 --> 01:10:26.546
Look around you.

01:10:31.550 --> 01:10:32.950
There's just some fucking toy-type thing.

01:10:33.110 --> 01:10:34.464
He doesn't have toys.

01:10:34.670 --> 01:10:37.583
- That's it.
- What? It's a fucking toy.

01:10:37.750 --> 01:10:39.070
Pull it apart.

01:10:39.950 --> 01:10:42.624
- Take it apart, Mike.
- Ah, damn it! Come on.

01:10:43.870 --> 01:10:46.021
We have to move quickly, Mr. Regan.

01:10:46.550 --> 01:10:47.700
Hey, where's my phone?

01:10:48.830 --> 01:10:50.549
Where is it? Where is my phone?

01:10:55.150 --> 01:10:56.379
I got it.

01:10:56.790 --> 01:10:58.224
Okay, that's one.

01:10:59.310 --> 01:11:01.506
Seriously, I can't find it.

01:11:02.870 --> 01:11:03.986
That's two.

01:11:05.710 --> 01:11:06.780
Wait, did you take my phone?

01:11:06.950 --> 01:11:08.907
No, I didn't take your phone.

01:11:10.190 --> 01:11:12.022
Someone's been playing games.

01:11:14.150 --> 01:11:15.220
Oh, shit.

01:11:19.710 --> 01:11:20.780
You must hurry.

01:11:21.510 --> 01:11:22.944
Just leave it, abort.

01:11:23.910 --> 01:11:25.060
Sixty seconds.

01:11:27.910 --> 01:11:29.344
Damn it, come on!

01:11:31.270 --> 01:11:33.227
We're burned. He's on the move.

01:11:34.390 --> 01:11:35.380
Abort!

01:11:36.790 --> 01:11:38.827
- I got them all.
- Grab what you can.

01:11:39.310 --> 01:11:40.460
He's moving.

01:11:40.710 --> 01:11:41.985
Now or never.

01:11:44.990 --> 01:11:46.743
- Forty seconds.
- I'm almost there.

01:11:56.910 --> 01:11:59.425
- That's it, I got them all.
- Five seconds.

01:12:02.710 --> 01:12:03.700
Get out now!

01:12:13.310 --> 01:12:14.949
- He has a gun.
- What? Where is he?

01:12:18.990 --> 01:12:20.504
Okay, wait.

01:12:23.430 --> 01:12:25.103
Can you confirm you're going to the...

01:12:25.270 --> 01:12:26.420
In the building.

01:12:37.030 --> 01:12:39.067
We got an officer down inside,

01:12:39.390 --> 01:12:42.144
Division Eight, Battalion One,
on a shooting...

01:12:42.310 --> 01:12:44.541
14300 East Alameda Avenue.

01:12:46.070 --> 01:12:47.390
I see him.

01:12:49.790 --> 01:12:51.588
Do exactly as I say.

01:12:54.750 --> 01:12:56.184
I'll tell you when to move.

01:13:16.310 --> 01:13:17.869
Step into the hall.

01:13:24.390 --> 01:13:25.460
Wait.

01:13:26.150 --> 01:13:27.186
Go.

01:13:45.270 --> 01:13:46.340
Your left.

01:13:51.430 --> 01:13:53.740
The fire escape, next floor up. Go!

01:14:13.550 --> 01:14:14.700
Hey!

01:14:17.310 --> 01:14:18.710
You motherfucker!

01:14:21.310 --> 01:14:23.188
I got them, I got them.

01:14:23.590 --> 01:14:24.819
Okay, let's go! Come on.

01:14:25.710 --> 01:14:26.985
Freeze, on your knees!

01:14:27.150 --> 01:14:28.709
Don't move! Put the gun down, now!

01:14:28.910 --> 01:14:31.061
- I have a permit!
- Drop the fucking weapon!

01:14:31.230 --> 01:14:32.346
- I have a permit.
- Put it down!

01:14:33.270 --> 01:14:34.750
Oh, shit.

01:14:39.270 --> 01:14:41.990
Look, officers, my permit's
in order, I just... I need it.

01:14:42.150 --> 01:14:43.345
There's this guy...

01:14:44.550 --> 01:14:45.700
What guy?

01:14:46.190 --> 01:14:48.022
This guy, I used to work for him...

01:14:50.750 --> 01:14:52.946
- He's been stalking me.
- You can't shoot him.

01:14:53.110 --> 01:14:54.021
I won't.

01:14:54.230 --> 01:14:56.600
You got a problem, then you come to us.

01:14:56.750 --> 01:14:57.760
Okay.

01:14:57.910 --> 01:14:58.980
- All right?
- All right.

01:14:59.830 --> 01:15:01.344
What do you need a gun for?

01:15:02.750 --> 01:15:05.629
You come to us, and we'll sort it out.

01:15:08.630 --> 01:15:09.620
Edward?

01:15:12.110 --> 01:15:13.988
I just... I just need it.

01:15:14.670 --> 01:15:17.230
You know, I've been fucking scared.
I just don't know where else to turn.

01:15:17.390 --> 01:15:19.268
You come to us and we'll sort it out.

01:15:19.430 --> 01:15:20.466
Yeah.

01:15:20.790 --> 01:15:24.147
Now I'm gonna give you this gun, tonight,

01:15:24.430 --> 01:15:25.659
- at the station.
- Okay.

01:15:25.830 --> 01:15:28.823
After you calm down.

01:15:28.990 --> 01:15:30.260
Thank you.

01:16:16.550 --> 01:16:18.428
9-1-1, where is your emergency?

01:16:19.030 --> 01:16:20.862
9-1-1, what is your emergency?

01:16:21.470 --> 01:16:23.268
Hello, operator?

01:16:23.430 --> 01:16:24.625
- Sir.
- Hello

01:16:24.790 --> 01:16:26.304
My name is Edward Porter.

01:16:26.470 --> 01:16:30.908
I'd like to report a...
Yes, I've been attacked.

01:16:31.070 --> 01:16:32.299
Tell me what's wrong with you, okay?

01:16:32.470 --> 01:16:34.939
It's, it's a, what do you
call it, it's a home invasion.

01:16:35.110 --> 01:16:36.703
All right, I need you to stay calm, okay?

01:16:36.910 --> 01:16:38.629
I don't know if he's still here.

01:16:38.830 --> 01:16:41.345
I'm hurt pretty bad, can you please come?

01:16:41.750 --> 01:16:44.185
422 147th Street.

01:16:44.350 --> 01:16:48.264
- I have...
- Please come, please!

01:16:48.430 --> 01:16:49.784
I have someone coming to you.

01:17:58.710 --> 01:18:00.190
Good luck, Mr. Regan,

01:18:01.950 --> 01:18:03.066
with the rest of it.

01:18:03.390 --> 01:18:04.426
Thanks.

01:18:47.910 --> 01:18:49.230
It's all there.

01:18:49.630 --> 01:18:51.144
All his programs.

01:18:51.310 --> 01:18:53.188
All the information he gathered on me.

01:18:53.350 --> 01:18:56.548
Everything he used to try and wreck my life.

01:18:57.710 --> 01:18:59.144
It's all there, everything.

01:18:59.350 --> 01:19:00.670
Have your lab look at it.

01:19:14.350 --> 01:19:15.466
How did you get these?

01:19:16.130 --> 01:19:18.224
Jim, can I see you for a minute?

01:19:18.390 --> 01:19:20.626
- What's up?
- Nah, I just need to see you for a minute.

01:19:20.830 --> 01:19:23.220
Yeah, sure.

01:19:23.390 --> 01:19:24.267
Thanks.

01:19:24.430 --> 01:19:25.705
I'll be back, Mr. Regan.

01:19:48.270 --> 01:19:51.900
What, Mike Regan over there?
Are you kidding? Huh?

01:19:53.470 --> 01:19:54.745
What are we gonna do about it?

01:19:55.150 --> 01:19:58.302
Well, I mean, evidence is...

01:19:59.910 --> 01:20:02.027
All right. You gonna do it?

01:20:02.670 --> 01:20:03.865
All right.

01:20:16.510 --> 01:20:17.990
- Stand up, please.
- Michael Regan, you are under arrest

01:20:18.150 --> 01:20:19.903
for burglary and aggravated assault.

01:20:20.150 --> 01:20:23.428
You have the right to remain silent.
Anything you say may be used against you.

01:20:23.590 --> 01:20:26.100
You have the right to have any attorney
present when being questioned.

01:20:26.310 --> 01:20:27.585
If you can't afford an attorney,
one will be appointed to you

01:20:27.750 --> 01:20:29.503
by the court of law of the city of Baltimore.

01:20:29.670 --> 01:20:30.865
Do you understand and hear these rights?

01:20:31.030 --> 01:20:32.828
That's him, right there!
Right there, that's him!

01:20:32.990 --> 01:20:34.106
- Keep walking.
- You motherfucker!

01:20:34.270 --> 01:20:36.182
- Hey, hey!
- I see you, Porter!

01:20:36.350 --> 01:20:38.501
Don't let him go, don't let him fucking walk!

01:20:38.670 --> 01:20:40.343
Come on, take him out of here!

01:20:40.510 --> 01:20:42.502
Hey, Porter! You shit bag, Porter!

01:20:42.950 --> 01:20:45.385
You fucking motherfucker, that's him!

01:20:45.550 --> 01:20:47.143
- Take it easy.
- I'll fuckin' kill ya!

01:21:02.150 --> 01:21:05.700
He's, um... Dad's in jail, right?

01:21:06.830 --> 01:21:09.504
Hey, hey.

01:21:10.310 --> 01:21:12.108
Dad's gonna be okay.

01:21:15.230 --> 01:21:17.187
Honey, he didn't do anything wrong.

01:21:26.510 --> 01:21:27.990
- Sir.
- Can I help you?

01:21:28.630 --> 01:21:30.349
I was wondering if,

01:21:30.870 --> 01:21:35.706
um, I could perhaps
have my thumb drives back?

01:21:36.310 --> 01:21:37.380
They're evidence.

01:21:38.150 --> 01:21:40.142
You can have them back when our lab says so.

01:21:45.270 --> 01:21:47.944
I also had a legally held firearm.

01:21:49.110 --> 01:21:50.510
That you can have.

01:21:51.510 --> 01:21:53.229
See the desk sergeant on the way out.

01:21:54.270 --> 01:21:55.420
Good night.

01:21:55.710 --> 01:21:57.861
Thank you, sir. Goodnight.

01:22:01.990 --> 01:22:03.265
You're the I.T. guy, right?

01:22:03.430 --> 01:22:05.387
Yeah, that's right, Ed Porter.

01:22:05.550 --> 01:22:08.748
Yeah, Mike Regan, you really
saved my ass in there today, thanks.

01:22:08.950 --> 01:22:10.987
This is my daughter, Kaitlyn, you know Rose.

01:22:11.150 --> 01:22:12.300
Stick around.

01:22:14.070 --> 01:22:17.586
You fucking psycho, I am not your friend.

01:22:21.630 --> 01:22:24.782
Listen to me, I will fucking kill you!

01:23:15.670 --> 01:23:16.820
Rose?

01:23:58.430 --> 01:23:59.920
Who's there?

01:24:26.350 --> 01:24:28.025
Who's there?

01:24:29.510 --> 01:24:31.046
Nobody.

01:24:52.230 --> 01:24:53.789
Drop the knife, Mike.

01:25:31.870 --> 01:25:34.385
They look perfect, don't they? Hm?

01:25:34.790 --> 01:25:36.827
- Tough guy?
- Oh!

01:25:39.830 --> 01:25:41.708
Come on, sit up straight.

01:25:44.470 --> 01:25:45.824
Sit up straight.

01:25:48.990 --> 01:25:49.980
Sit up straight!

01:25:58.390 --> 01:26:00.160
Ed.

01:26:01.670 --> 01:26:04.822
So, here we are, all together now.

01:26:05.670 --> 01:26:08.265
Let's play happy families, let's sing a song.

01:26:11.910 --> 01:26:14.903
Then maybe I kill everyone in the room.

01:26:17.590 --> 01:26:19.809
Rose, shoulders back.

01:26:20.950 --> 01:26:21.906
Come on, Rose.

01:26:28.990 --> 01:26:30.549
Is this what you want?

01:26:31.550 --> 01:26:34.668
Is this what you want, is that what you want?

01:26:40.390 --> 01:26:43.781
I'm not scared of you any more, Mike.
I don't like you any more, Mike.

01:26:49.990 --> 01:26:53.984
# No one listens any more #

01:26:54.150 --> 01:26:58.144
# When no one listens, what are words for #

01:26:58.310 --> 01:27:00.080
# When no one listens #

01:27:00.230 --> 01:27:03.347
# No one's listening at all #

01:27:34.190 --> 01:27:36.190
Mike, Mike.

01:27:36.390 --> 01:27:37.346
Mike!

01:29:57.990 --> 01:29:58.980
Mike.

01:30:01.550 --> 01:30:02.620
Mike!

01:30:05.150 --> 01:30:06.266
Mike!

01:30:08.470 --> 01:30:09.506
Please.

01:30:11.070 --> 01:30:12.140
Don't.

01:30:18.750 --> 01:30:19.820
Mike?

01:30:24.630 --> 01:30:25.780
Mike!

01:30:27.990 --> 01:30:29.629
Mike, please, don't.

01:30:31.070 --> 01:30:32.299
For god's sake!

01:30:32.470 --> 01:30:33.984
Don't kill him!

01:30:34.150 --> 01:30:36.142
Please, don't kill him!

01:30:36.510 --> 01:30:37.705
Honey, please.
