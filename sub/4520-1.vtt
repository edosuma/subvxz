04:42.451 --> 04:44.912
Maybe the cap you
started with was too thick.

04:47.832 --> 04:50.293
We have time.
We'll find one that fits.

05:15.276 --> 05:17.987
<i>...It's not gonna last.</i>

05:18.029 --> 05:19.280
<i>I'm thirsty.</i>

05:19.322 --> 05:21.615
<i>My tongue is swollen up bad.</i>

05:21.657 --> 05:25.244
<i>I never thought our hiding place
would outlast our well.</i>

05:25.286 --> 05:27.038
<i>Is anyone out there?</i>

05:28.247 --> 05:29.999
Can anyone answer me?

05:30.041 --> 05:31.125
Can you hear me?

05:31.167 --> 05:32.918
<i>Anyone?</i>

05:32.960 --> 05:34.795
<i>Anyone...</i>

05:54.732 --> 05:56.859
<i>He)‚Äù Upstairs!</i>

05:56.901 --> 05:58.361
<i>I'll check the attic.</i>

05:58.402 --> 05:59.820
<i>Sure.</i>

06:16.712 --> 06:18.464
<i>Don, there's nothin'.</i>

06:20.966 --> 06:22.718
<i>There is no water here.</i>

06:31.268 --> 06:33.437
- <i>Dave, what about--</i>
- <i>Let's just go.</i>

07:23.779 --> 07:25.239
Water.

07:41.422 --> 07:43.007
Water.

07:50.347 --> 07:51.640
Thank you.

07:53.601 --> 07:55.394
Is anyone else with you?

07:59.899 --> 08:03.194
The others,
they left you here?

08:09.366 --> 08:10.868
Oh.

08:14.955 --> 08:16.957
You could rest here awhile.

08:16.999 --> 08:19.752
You can't walk
out of the valley.

08:19.793 --> 08:20.794
Even if you weren't injured...

08:20.836 --> 08:23.088
I'm not trying to walk
out of the valley.

08:23.130 --> 08:25.633
My sister's on the far side.

08:25.674 --> 08:31.972
I just need enough water
to make it to my sister.

08:32.014 --> 08:33.640
She isn't well.

08:49.865 --> 08:51.742
You can't stay here, either.

08:51.784 --> 08:53.869
I'm okay.
I have my plan.

08:58.582 --> 09:00.376
They're always hunting.

09:00.417 --> 09:02.586
You stay put,
they'll find you.

09:02.628 --> 09:04.922
Or your well will go dry,
whichever's first.

09:19.061 --> 09:21.438
They're hunting in the south.

09:21.480 --> 09:23.232
It's safer to go north.

09:26.277 --> 09:27.695
Keep it.

09:31.115 --> 09:32.408
Wait.

09:38.414 --> 09:40.124
Stay lucky.

10:13.741 --> 10:15.159
I'm good.

10:23.250 --> 10:24.710
Where's Dean?

10:24.752 --> 10:27.755
Hunting up some food.

10:27.796 --> 10:29.673
He's getting worse,
isn't he?

10:37.014 --> 10:38.515
Kendal...

10:42.686 --> 10:47.066
Remember when this
was all rice paddies?

10:47.107 --> 10:49.485
Catching all those frogs?

10:51.654 --> 10:54.073
Do you think it'll
ever rain again?

11:18.889 --> 11:21.183
So you found a wreck?

11:24.812 --> 11:26.689
Yeah, just outside
the pumping field.

11:26.730 --> 11:28.273
It's new.

11:28.315 --> 11:30.150
Two, maybe three weeks.

11:30.192 --> 11:32.236
We should be able
to find something.

11:32.277 --> 11:33.737
Thanks.

11:36.699 --> 11:38.534
You know I can help you.

13:29.937 --> 13:31.313
Heard Island.

13:31.355 --> 13:33.857
All that cold water.

13:33.899 --> 13:36.401
That's a good spot then.

13:42.991 --> 13:46.787
Plane lands on a
bright green field,

13:46.829 --> 13:49.373
pumping lightly along
until it comes to a rest

13:49.414 --> 13:51.667
next to a low stone wall,

13:51.708 --> 13:53.544
built hundreds and hundreds
of years ago

13:53.585 --> 13:55.712
by the earliest explorers.

13:57.923 --> 14:02.761
There's a stone building
not far in the distance

14:02.803 --> 14:06.181
with a cold stream connecting
the snowcap mountains above

14:06.223 --> 14:08.016
to the blue-grey sea below.

14:12.396 --> 14:15.399
And if you wipe the steam
off the cockpit window,

14:19.194 --> 14:23.907
you can see penguins
and sheath piles

14:23.949 --> 14:28.328
and elephant seals

14:28.370 --> 14:30.789
covering the black mange.

14:50.350 --> 14:53.270
<i>...And I'm scared.</i>

14:53.312 --> 14:55.898
<i>Can anyone help?</i>

14:55.939 --> 14:57.858
<i>I'm on the Dover farm.</i>

15:01.820 --> 15:04.698
<i>And someone is outside.</i>

15:04.740 --> 15:07.284
<i>He's got a mask.</i>

15:07.326 --> 15:11.330
<i>I'm so scared.</i>

15:11.371 --> 15:13.040
<i>Can anyone help?</i>

15:20.547 --> 15:21.757
What's going on?

15:21.798 --> 15:24.009
Someone's at the Dover farm.

15:24.051 --> 15:25.802
You shouldn't go.

15:25.844 --> 15:26.887
You always did.

15:26.929 --> 15:28.263
You'll be okay without me.

15:28.305 --> 15:30.057
It's not me I'm worried about.

15:36.188 --> 15:38.023
Stay lucky.

16:39.918 --> 16:43.171
<i>...And I'm scared.</i>

16:48.677 --> 16:51.179
<i>I'm so thirsty.
Please come.</i>

17:11.324 --> 17:14.618
<i>Our well has gone dry.</i>

17:14.661 --> 17:16.579
We have no more water.

17:16.621 --> 17:18.498
<i>There are others
hiding out there,</i>

17:18.540 --> 17:20.834
<i>parasite drinking my water.</i>

17:20.876 --> 17:24.880
<i>Pick up the radio
and try again.</i>

17:26.339 --> 17:28.383
<i>Please, let these two--</i>

17:28.425 --> 17:30.802
<i>Pick up the radio
and call out again</i>

17:30.844 --> 17:32.721
<i>or I'll have these two shot.</i>

17:38.018 --> 17:39.436
<i>People used to show mercy.</i>

17:39.478 --> 17:41.146
<i>Wells go dry.</i>

17:42.189 --> 17:44.024
<i>People change.</i>

17:55.452 --> 17:58.038
There are no more farms.

17:58.080 --> 18:00.499
There's no more farms,
they're all done in.

18:00.540 --> 18:01.917
Please.

18:04.294 --> 18:05.670
You don't want to kill her.

18:05.712 --> 18:07.756
There's a man of God in here.

18:07.798 --> 18:10.509
We're not going to hurt you.

18:10.550 --> 18:12.052
You must be thirsty.

18:12.094 --> 18:14.721
They're always thirsty.
Give her some of my water.

18:16.723 --> 18:17.974
Come on.

18:21.978 --> 18:23.605
Mr. Carson!
Mr. Carson!

18:23.647 --> 18:25.273
It's a trap!
It's a trap!

18:25.315 --> 18:26.691
Ah!

18:32.697 --> 18:34.991
This is a fine house.

18:35.033 --> 18:37.202
My grandfather
always admired it.

18:43.333 --> 18:45.168
Search it.

18:45.210 --> 18:47.629
Then on to the next.
We're finished here.

20:08.084 --> 20:11.504
<i>They're like rats
eating a sandwich.</i>

20:11.546 --> 20:13.715
<i>You! Keep tearing
this farm apart.</i>

20:13.757 --> 20:15.175
<i>We'll take the kitchen.</i>

20:18.720 --> 20:20.388
Look how sweet, father.

20:20.430 --> 20:22.224
Someone closed her eyes.

20:24.976 --> 20:26.853
Pray for her, Cadiz.

20:26.895 --> 20:30.649
Pray for each of these
desperate, thirsty souls.

20:30.690 --> 20:32.275
You'd think after
ten years of no rain

20:32.317 --> 20:33.151
they'd give up.

20:43.703 --> 20:45.538
There can't be many left.

20:48.041 --> 20:53.380
We're going to hunt them
from dry well to dry well.

20:55.090 --> 21:00.387
If they're alive,
they're consuming my water.

21:00.428 --> 21:04.808
And they can't consume my water
without my consent.

23:35.917 --> 23:38.878
Distributor cap didn't fit!

23:44.259 --> 23:47.429
I wouldn't let them
follow me here...

23:49.180 --> 23:52.350
You know that, right?

23:52.392 --> 23:55.478
Not like we want
anything with you, anyway.

23:55.520 --> 23:58.106
We found the Cessna.

23:58.148 --> 23:59.941
It's ours.

23:59.983 --> 24:04.821
Just the same,
maybe we'd let you come with us.

24:04.863 --> 24:06.739
Maybe.

24:12.412 --> 24:15.540
You have a good spot here.
I'll grant you that.

24:20.253 --> 24:26.468
But we have water...
And you don't.

24:26.509 --> 24:28.470
That's why I'm safe here.

24:28.511 --> 24:30.889
You're too small
to be on your own.

24:33.057 --> 24:36.978
I'm safer on my own.

24:37.020 --> 24:43.067
Okay, I am not
going to argue with you.

24:43.109 --> 24:45.570
I mean, you seem to be
doing alright.

24:46.321 --> 24:49.324
But Dean and I,
we're not like the others.

26:16.327 --> 26:18.997
You try loosening
the inlet flange?

26:21.249 --> 26:23.334
Refill it with water
to prime it?

26:23.376 --> 26:26.462
It's not the pump.
It's like the well gave out.

26:26.504 --> 26:28.923
Just isn't filling anymore.

26:34.178 --> 26:37.515
When you were at the compound,
were the derricks pumping?

26:37.557 --> 26:38.349
All of them.

26:38.391 --> 26:39.517
And the truck came.

26:39.559 --> 26:42.895
Never seen them fill it so fast.

26:42.937 --> 26:44.856
You don't need the plane.

26:44.897 --> 26:45.607
You move at night.

26:45.648 --> 26:47.817
Take as much water
as you can carry.

26:47.859 --> 26:49.277
You can reach
my uncle's place in,

26:49.319 --> 26:50.987
I don't know,
about three or four weeks-

26:51.029 --> 26:52.447
Stop!

26:52.488 --> 26:53.948
You know I'm dying, Kendal.

26:53.990 --> 26:57.285
Without enough water,
my kidneys are done.

27:04.792 --> 27:06.711
I'm not going anywhere
without you.

27:06.753 --> 27:08.796
Move over.

27:19.515 --> 27:21.851
I'm not going to leave you here.

27:24.646 --> 27:27.106
I'm going to find it.

27:30.818 --> 27:32.779
<i>This is the Birch farm.</i>

27:32.820 --> 27:36.783
<i>This is the Birch farm,
land grant 2371,</i>

27:36.824 --> 27:39.035
<i>calling for Mr. Carson.</i>

27:39.077 --> 27:42.622
<i>We'd like to request- noon
today- to the refugee camp.</i>

27:42.664 --> 27:44.832
<i>...Birch farm.</i>

27:44.874 --> 27:46.584
<i>...371.</i>

27:46.626 --> 27:49.462
<i>We'd like to request...
...Refugee camp.</i>

27:49.504 --> 27:51.631
The Birch farm.

27:51.673 --> 27:54.217
I guess that leaves
us and the boy.

27:58.596 --> 27:59.972
You don't have to go.

28:00.014 --> 28:01.391
I need to see what happens.

28:01.432 --> 28:04.060
If it looks okay,
maybe we should call in, too.

29:51.709 --> 29:54.921
I drink the tears of those
who have gone before us.

29:54.962 --> 29:56.756
And my spirit is quenched.

29:57.799 --> 30:00.384
We're done here.

30:00.426 --> 30:02.804
The well went dry.

30:02.845 --> 30:05.139
We took it as far as we could.

30:08.100 --> 30:15.274
But it has been six months
of terror and hiding.

30:15.316 --> 30:18.528
How many dead?

30:18.569 --> 30:22.907
With Simon gone,
there's nothing for us here.

30:22.949 --> 30:25.660
Just come with us.

30:25.701 --> 30:27.161
They can help Dean.

30:27.203 --> 30:29.330
Flacker says they
have medicine.

30:35.169 --> 30:38.005
You never knew family.

30:38.047 --> 30:40.716
We can start again.

30:40.758 --> 30:42.844
Make a new family.

30:42.885 --> 30:45.763
I hear Carson has a daughter.

30:45.805 --> 30:48.516
We can send them to get Dean.

30:48.558 --> 30:49.767
It's his kidneys, girl.

30:49.809 --> 30:51.686
Same as his sister Pia.

30:51.727 --> 30:53.437
There's just no way you kids
are getting out of here.

30:53.479 --> 30:54.981
I can find Dean more water.

30:55.022 --> 30:56.607
Things might be better
outside the valley.

30:56.649 --> 30:59.193
If we go north,
there has to be water.

30:59.235 --> 31:01.320
You still have faith.

31:03.197 --> 31:05.950
That's good.

31:05.992 --> 31:10.538
We hid a day's worth of water
on the north side of the house.

31:10.580 --> 31:12.790
Welcome to it once we're gone.

31:14.667 --> 31:16.377
Didn't your people
have a plane?

31:16.419 --> 31:17.545
Used to.

31:17.587 --> 31:18.796
Shot down over
the pumping field.

31:18.838 --> 31:21.173
Burned out there
for two days straight.

31:22.592 --> 31:24.760
Guess that's one way out.

32:16.938 --> 32:18.898
Welcome, Mr. Carson.

32:18.940 --> 32:21.484
Thank you for
responding to our call.

32:21.525 --> 32:23.194
We are unarmed and ready.

32:23.235 --> 32:24.445
Good.

32:24.487 --> 32:26.656
If you'd like to look around...

32:28.699 --> 32:31.911
Then shall they begin
to say to the mountains

32:31.953 --> 32:35.706
fall on us,
to the hills cover us.

32:35.748 --> 32:38.542
For if they do these
things in a green tree,

32:38.584 --> 32:41.295
what shall be done in the dry?

33:08.155 --> 33:09.281
I know this is hard,

33:09.323 --> 33:11.993
but just isn't enough
water, you see?

33:12.034 --> 33:13.536
Listen to me.

33:13.577 --> 33:16.622
These were old people
and they're going to suffer.

33:16.664 --> 33:18.040
You understand?

33:18.082 --> 33:19.917
I had to do it.

33:19.959 --> 33:22.378
You're different.

33:22.420 --> 33:23.087
I can tell.

33:23.129 --> 33:26.799
Now, tell me,

33:26.841 --> 33:29.135
is there anybody else
on the farm?

33:31.595 --> 33:33.556
Huh?
Come on now.

33:33.597 --> 33:35.182
Listen, if we're going
to have a relationship,

33:35.224 --> 33:37.184
that's based on trust.

33:37.226 --> 33:38.728
You have to come clean.

33:38.769 --> 33:40.563
Please don't.

33:40.604 --> 33:43.858
Otherwise,
what's the point?

33:49.447 --> 33:52.366
Yeah, there's one more.

33:52.408 --> 33:53.784
One more.

33:53.826 --> 33:56.287
Use the heat sensors.

33:56.328 --> 33:58.831
You look like a man who prays...

34:13.554 --> 34:15.931
Sit, daughter of mine.

34:15.973 --> 34:18.893
I believe this is going
to be the last holdout.

34:18.934 --> 34:20.603
As far as the eye can see,

34:20.643 --> 34:25.190
this valley has Carson's buried
under every acre of it.

34:25.232 --> 34:28.110
And I'm not going to stop
until it's all ours.

34:28.152 --> 34:30.737
They suffer less
this way, don't they?

34:30.780 --> 34:32.572
These little people?

34:39.246 --> 34:44.585
Think of it as an
extinction of a species,

34:44.627 --> 34:53.094
like the passenger pigeon or
the ivory-billed Woodpecker.

34:53.135 --> 34:57.139
Your world is about
to get so much better.

34:57.181 --> 34:59.725
What could be better than this?

35:41.851 --> 35:43.727
This one is yours, my love.

35:52.361 --> 35:54.864
Now, is that everyone?

35:55.906 --> 35:57.366
Hmm?

35:58.284 --> 36:00.119
Yes, sir.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.608
Ah!

39:50.599 --> 39:52.393
How is the pump?

39:55.479 --> 39:58.148
It's slow.

39:58.190 --> 40:00.734
But okay.
The usual.

40:05.406 --> 40:07.199
Did you get hurt?

40:07.241 --> 40:08.951
Nope.

40:08.992 --> 40:10.285
Good.

40:25.134 --> 40:29.012
I know why our pump is failing.

40:29.054 --> 40:30.264
Why?

40:33.767 --> 40:35.811
They're draining the aquifer.

40:35.853 --> 40:38.272
All those pumps going
around the clock.

40:38.313 --> 40:41.692
They're sucking the water
right out from under us...

40:41.733 --> 40:44.486
But it's our well.

40:44.528 --> 40:48.532
If the company drains
all the water,

40:48.574 --> 40:50.826
drive all the
squatters away,

40:50.868 --> 40:53.370
they control
the whole valley.

41:07.050 --> 41:09.970
Maybe we should call Carson.

41:10.012 --> 41:11.930
Maybe the company
camps aren't so bad.

41:11.972 --> 41:13.765
We can't.

41:13.807 --> 41:17.644
Carson's not taking
people to camps.

41:17.686 --> 41:20.481
He's the one that's been
doing all the killing.

42:05.984 --> 42:08.403
It's not Christmas yet.

42:08.445 --> 42:09.780
Says who?

42:19.206 --> 42:22.459
That's good.

42:24.503 --> 42:27.047
We should go back inside.

42:27.089 --> 42:30.133
They'll be hunting soon.

42:30.634 --> 42:31.885
Wait.

42:34.388 --> 42:36.098
I want to visit her grave.

42:36.139 --> 42:37.224
Tomorrow.

42:37.266 --> 42:39.560
I need to say goodbye.

42:58.245 --> 42:59.830
I miss her.

43:02.874 --> 43:07.087
You were just crazy enough
for her to like you.

43:07.129 --> 43:08.755
I wasn't near as
crazy as your sister.

43:08.797 --> 43:10.340
No one was.

43:10.382 --> 43:13.176
Do you think it
keeps us here?

43:13.218 --> 43:14.511
Her grave?

43:14.553 --> 43:17.598
Of course not.

43:17.639 --> 43:18.890
Let's go back in.

43:18.932 --> 43:21.351
Listen...

43:21.393 --> 43:26.023
When the time comes,
I want you to burn my body.

43:26.064 --> 43:29.234
Don't bury it.
Not like this.

43:29.276 --> 43:35.532
Nothing ties you to this house,
you understand?

43:35.574 --> 43:39.620
You'll burn my body and
go to my uncle's place.

43:41.872 --> 43:45.834
It's what Pia would have wanted.

43:45.876 --> 43:48.462
Okay, I promise.

43:50.422 --> 43:54.009
But I'm going to get us both
out of here long before you die.

43:55.636 --> 43:56.845
Come on.

44:12.027 --> 44:14.071
I'll be right back.

45:43.744 --> 45:45.829
Hello the house!

45:50.584 --> 45:53.336
Whosoever killed
in the trenches.

45:53.378 --> 45:55.672
Whosoever left a
man's lifeless body

45:55.714 --> 45:57.007
to the wind and
the vultures,

45:57.048 --> 45:59.217
without the dignity
of a burial,

45:59.259 --> 46:00.761
come forward.

46:00.802 --> 46:04.931
Confess thy sins,
dearly beloveds!

46:04.973 --> 46:07.225
We bring mercy.

46:11.521 --> 46:15.108
Whosoever wants to
live another hour.

46:15.150 --> 46:17.444
Whosoever wants
to see another day.

46:17.486 --> 46:20.030
Come forward!

46:20.071 --> 46:22.491
Step into the light!

46:31.249 --> 46:32.876
I did what I could do.

46:32.918 --> 46:35.629
Search it and gas it.

47:18.088 --> 47:19.256
<i>The attic.
Above us.</i>

47:19.297 --> 47:20.882
<i>Go! Go! Go!</i>

47:20.924 --> 47:23.009
<i>Up the stairs!
Hurry!</i>

48:38.460 --> 48:41.922
The sun's been pounding this
side of the building all day...

48:46.134 --> 48:49.304
Gas it, then we'll move on.

49:55.996 --> 49:57.205
Don't put--
Don't put it there.

49:57.247 --> 49:58.415
Put it on the siding.

49:58.456 --> 50:01.459
There's no sense in destroying
the beauty of the craftsmanship.

50:01.501 --> 50:03.336
Respect the carpenter.

50:04.713 --> 50:06.214
Onward, then.

50:06.256 --> 50:08.216
Next property's north,
northeast.

50:08.258 --> 50:10.218
The King track.

51:06.316 --> 51:07.317
I know.

51:07.358 --> 51:09.402
I'm going to get you water.

52:22.183 --> 52:24.352
Come on.
Keep moving.

53:10.273 --> 53:11.774
Ah!

53:49.187 --> 53:50.688
Alby!

53:53.858 --> 53:56.069
Alby!

54:08.248 --> 54:09.749
Pssst!

54:09.791 --> 54:11.251
Are you okay?

54:17.548 --> 54:20.093
I watch them in the shadows

54:20.134 --> 54:22.637
waiting for me
to make a mistake.

54:24.305 --> 54:27.392
I won't make a mistake.

54:29.102 --> 54:31.187
- Everyone makes mist-
- Shh...

54:33.314 --> 54:34.774
Wait for dark.

54:34.816 --> 54:36.859
Then leave.

54:36.901 --> 54:39.529
You're not helping me like this.

54:48.871 --> 54:51.708
Will you show me where you hide
in case I need to find you?

54:54.252 --> 54:58.589
They always come looking
after you've been here.

54:58.631 --> 55:02.218
I don't need you to come by.

55:02.260 --> 55:04.637
But we're going
to get out of this,

55:04.679 --> 55:06.639
you, me and Dean.

55:06.681 --> 55:07.682
I'm going to come for you

55:07.724 --> 55:11.978
and we'll leave
this place, I promise.

55:15.023 --> 55:17.775
Promise doesn't mean a thing.

56:44.320 --> 56:45.571
What is it?

56:45.613 --> 56:48.408
Vagrants.
Heading for us.

56:48.449 --> 56:50.076
How do they look?

56:50.118 --> 56:52.245
They're in bad shape.

56:52.286 --> 56:53.746
It's okay. They'll see
that Carson's been here

56:53.788 --> 56:55.039
and they'll take off.

56:55.081 --> 56:58.334
We'll just wait.
They won't find anything.

56:58.376 --> 57:00.878
And if they die
on our doorstep?

57:03.381 --> 57:05.007
We've got a good store of water.

57:05.049 --> 57:07.677
You say the pump's
in good shape.

57:07.718 --> 57:09.762
Why not help them?

57:12.390 --> 57:16.853
What if it's just another
one of Carson's traps?

57:16.894 --> 57:22.108
We've got plenty of water,
right?

57:22.150 --> 57:24.527
Right.

57:24.569 --> 57:27.363
We have the water.
I'll give them a flask.

57:33.911 --> 57:35.580
Just in case.

57:35.621 --> 57:37.707
Not everyone is as
charitable as you.

58:12.909 --> 58:16.162
It's long gone.

58:16.204 --> 58:18.956
We're not going to
make it to another barn.

58:18.998 --> 58:22.668
We won't survive
the noon sun.

58:22.710 --> 58:26.631
Oh, come on.
We'll wait out the heat.

58:26.672 --> 58:29.258
We got another farm in us yet.

58:29.300 --> 58:32.637
Come on, all the wells in
this valley can't be dry.

58:38.142 --> 58:39.769
Don't please.

58:39.810 --> 58:42.772
Wait, wait,
please don't kill us.

58:42.813 --> 58:44.815
We don't have guns.

58:44.857 --> 58:46.108
Only knives.

58:46.150 --> 58:47.985
We mean you no harm.

58:48.027 --> 58:52.490
We're just very thirsty.

58:52.532 --> 58:54.283
Why did Carson send you?

58:54.325 --> 58:56.369
That liar?

58:56.410 --> 58:59.413
We're not with Carson.

58:59.455 --> 59:02.917
We're just thirsty.

59:02.959 --> 59:05.211
Carson hit our farm
some time back.

59:05.253 --> 59:08.673
Folks thought he'd help them.

59:08.714 --> 59:11.509
We're the only ones
that survived.

59:11.551 --> 59:13.469
Our well's been long dry.

59:13.511 --> 59:15.555
And we had a good
store of water

59:15.596 --> 59:19.475
until they ran it
into the ground.

59:19.517 --> 59:23.271
We held on a week
before moving on.

59:23.312 --> 59:27.525
Every well we've come to
in this valley's been dry.

59:27.567 --> 59:29.235
You done?

59:31.404 --> 59:31.904
Here's the deal.

59:31.946 --> 59:35.032
You'll walk in front of me
to that tower over there.

59:35.074 --> 59:35.950
I'm going to pass
you my flask

59:35.992 --> 59:37.743
and when it's dry,
you'll move on.

59:37.785 --> 59:39.954
You won't look back,
won't come back.

59:55.344 --> 59:56.887
So you been visited, too.

59:56.929 --> 59:58.514
Keep moving.

01:00:00.349 --> 01:00:03.561
Those notices they post,
instructions,

01:00:03.603 --> 01:00:05.313
they're all lies.

01:00:05.354 --> 01:00:06.814
It's a trap.

01:00:24.415 --> 01:00:26.459
Easy, easy, easy, easy.

01:00:39.764 --> 01:00:41.682
Thank you.

01:00:41.724 --> 01:00:44.560
From the bottom of our hearts.

01:00:44.602 --> 01:00:48.481
We wouldn't have made it
to another well.

01:00:49.732 --> 01:00:52.860
How many of you are here?

01:00:52.902 --> 01:00:54.362
I'm on my own.

01:00:54.403 --> 01:00:55.821
Come with us, then.

01:00:55.863 --> 01:00:57.865
Safety in numbers.

01:00:57.907 --> 01:00:59.617
We owe you.

01:00:59.659 --> 01:01:01.369
We're trying to
get to the mountains.

01:01:01.410 --> 01:01:03.079
You've got a gun.

01:01:03.120 --> 01:01:06.165
Improves all of our chances.

01:01:06.207 --> 01:01:07.958
I can't.

01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.752
Why not?

01:01:09.794 --> 01:01:11.587
Looks kind of lonesome here.

01:01:11.629 --> 01:01:16.842
Whoever you're waiting for,
they ain't coming back.

01:01:20.930 --> 01:01:23.432
You guys should start
back on your way.

01:01:25.976 --> 01:01:29.647
Thank you,
from all of us.

01:01:29.689 --> 01:01:31.899
Thank you.

01:01:32.525 --> 01:01:35.403
Were they in trouble?

01:01:35.444 --> 01:01:36.779
Thirsty people at the end.

01:01:36.821 --> 01:01:39.949
Carson's already killed
everyone else at their farm.

01:01:47.206 --> 01:01:51.711
We're done, aren't we?

01:01:51.752 --> 01:01:53.587
We're doing fine.

01:01:53.629 --> 01:01:58.384
No.

01:01:58.426 --> 01:02:01.345
You've been giving me
your water for a week.

01:02:01.387 --> 01:02:03.305
So what is it?

01:02:07.309 --> 01:02:09.061
What is it?

01:02:11.647 --> 01:02:13.899
The pump's dry.

01:02:16.152 --> 01:02:17.987
HOW long?

01:02:18.028 --> 01:02:20.281
Two days.

01:02:20.322 --> 01:02:23.784
How long can we survive
on the water we have?

01:02:25.369 --> 01:02:28.038
A week.

01:02:28.080 --> 01:02:30.166
Maybe.

01:02:30.207 --> 01:02:32.626
Why wouldn't you tell me?

01:02:32.668 --> 01:02:34.920
I thought you'd be gone already.

01:02:45.681 --> 01:02:48.267
I need to try the wreck outside
the pumping compound gates.

01:02:48.309 --> 01:02:50.436
For the missing distributor cap.

01:02:50.478 --> 01:02:51.771
We've tried so many--

01:02:51.812 --> 01:02:53.481
It's too dangerous.

01:02:53.522 --> 01:02:56.442
There's nowhere else to try.
At least we'll know.

01:02:56.484 --> 01:02:58.068
I just don't know how to
get that close to the gates

01:02:58.110 --> 01:03:00.404
without them spotting me.

01:03:04.325 --> 01:03:08.662
Do they still dump their
waste oil by the fence?

01:03:08.704 --> 01:03:10.539
Yeah.

01:03:19.924 --> 01:03:24.303
I know how you can get close.

01:03:24.345 --> 01:03:29.725
What's the one thing they fear
in a world without water?

01:04:34.039 --> 01:04:35.249
<i>Who did this?</i>

01:04:35.291 --> 01:04:36.750
<i>How did they breach the fence?</i>

01:04:46.969 --> 01:04:49.513
<i>Go on. Fan out and find out
who breached the fence.</i>

01:04:50.431 --> 01:04:51.557
<i>This is ridiculous.</i>

01:04:51.599 --> 01:04:53.142
<i>Find them!</i>

01:04:54.435 --> 01:04:56.103
<i>Come on.
Get out there.</i>

01:04:56.145 --> 01:04:58.147
<i>Get the rest of the men.</i>

01:05:42.524 --> 01:05:44.193
What's going on?

01:05:47.363 --> 01:05:48.864
We did it.

01:05:53.410 --> 01:05:54.870
You did it.

01:05:54.912 --> 01:05:57.247
Shut up.

01:05:57.289 --> 01:05:59.667
I'll carry you the
whole way if I have to.

01:06:01.293 --> 01:06:02.378
I got it all worked out.

01:06:02.419 --> 01:06:03.253
We can't leave just yet.

01:06:03.295 --> 01:06:05.881
We'll be too slow
over open ground.

01:06:05.923 --> 01:06:07.466
- We'll wait for dark.
- Kendal.

01:06:07.508 --> 01:06:09.134
We can have the plane
prepped by daylight.

01:06:09.176 --> 01:06:12.096
You, me, Alby,
we're getting out of here.

01:06:12.137 --> 01:06:13.555
Kendal.

01:06:23.023 --> 01:06:24.149
Beautiful,
but there's no time-

01:06:24.191 --> 01:06:26.443
- One more story...
- Later.

01:06:26.485 --> 01:06:27.987
I promise.

01:06:30.489 --> 01:06:35.452
Here, I'll go get water,
but drink this.

01:06:35.494 --> 01:06:37.746
You can have as
much as you want.

01:07:40.934 --> 01:07:43.896
Didn't I say that anyone with
water to give must have a well?

01:07:43.937 --> 01:07:45.439
Mm-hmm.

01:07:45.939 --> 01:07:48.650
Shh.

01:07:48.692 --> 01:07:52.988
You hid it so cleverly we had
to wait for you to get a drink.

01:07:53.030 --> 01:07:56.533
We're very sorry about
how this turned out.

01:07:56.575 --> 01:07:57.993
Let's end this.

01:07:58.035 --> 01:08:00.496
There's not enough
water for her, too.

01:08:00.537 --> 01:08:02.581
When you're right...

01:08:04.666 --> 01:08:06.085
...You're right.

01:08:10.089 --> 01:08:11.507
Ah!

01:08:44.413 --> 01:08:45.874
Hmm.

01:08:51.462 --> 01:08:53.131
Hmm.

01:09:00.930 --> 01:09:02.850
They're coming!
Run!

01:09:08.272 --> 01:09:09.689
Come on.

01:09:22.786 --> 01:09:24.537
Stay quiet.

01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:28.876
And no matter what,
don't you ever dare come back.

01:09:28.917 --> 01:09:30.711
I'll come back.

01:09:30.752 --> 01:09:32.462
Dean!

01:10:19.218 --> 01:10:21.136
Well, hello there.

01:10:21.178 --> 01:10:22.638
We heard shots.

01:10:22.679 --> 01:10:24.890
Where are the others?

01:10:24.932 --> 01:10:27.726
It's just me now.

01:10:27.768 --> 01:10:31.063
The others are dead.

01:10:31.104 --> 01:10:33.398
Our well just ran dry

01:10:33.440 --> 01:10:36.443
and we were fighting
for the remaining water.

01:10:36.485 --> 01:10:37.527
Hmm...

01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:43.075
Just ran dry.

01:10:43.116 --> 01:10:45.911
And you killed the
others yourself?

01:10:45.953 --> 01:10:47.246
Confess, son.

01:10:47.287 --> 01:10:49.498
It'll only take the pain away.

01:10:52.459 --> 01:10:54.628
I killed them.

01:10:54.670 --> 01:10:56.046
You're a fighter.

01:10:56.088 --> 01:10:58.048
I like that.

01:11:04.388 --> 01:11:08.016
You know how I knew that
you were here all the time?

01:11:08.058 --> 01:11:12.229
I mean, not you specifically,
but someone?

01:11:14.940 --> 01:11:17.901
Birds.

01:11:17.943 --> 01:11:21.321
Birds go where
the water is, so...

01:11:25.117 --> 01:11:27.577
You afflicted with something?

01:11:27.619 --> 01:11:30.247
The boy looks ill.

01:11:30.289 --> 01:11:32.291
I remember this house.

01:11:32.332 --> 01:11:35.002
Look at this.
This door frame is beautiful.

01:11:35.043 --> 01:11:36.461
Sturdy.

01:11:42.843 --> 01:11:44.011
Good one.

01:11:44.052 --> 01:11:46.096
- I built it.
- Oh.

01:11:46.138 --> 01:11:48.390
With Mr. Miller.

01:11:48.432 --> 01:11:50.684
Wow, Mr. Miller!
You don't say.

01:11:50.726 --> 01:11:52.728
Well, my hat's off
to both of you.

01:11:52.769 --> 01:11:55.230
Mr. Miller left the land to me.

01:11:57.357 --> 01:12:00.152
But not the water.

01:12:00.193 --> 01:12:04.906
You see, there was a time
when a man owned the land,

01:12:04.948 --> 01:12:07.701
he controlled the water,
but things are different.

01:12:07.743 --> 01:12:11.163
The water's mine,
so the land is mine.

01:12:13.874 --> 01:12:16.168
Empty-

01:12:16.209 --> 01:12:18.378
Then go check the barn.

01:12:32.017 --> 01:12:33.268
Get down!

01:12:34.519 --> 01:12:35.604
Get him!

01:12:41.568 --> 01:12:43.320
Put it down.

01:13:09.012 --> 01:13:11.681
He's wounded, Cadiz.

01:13:14.309 --> 01:13:15.727
Agh!

01:13:21.650 --> 01:13:23.193
For shame.

01:13:26.196 --> 01:13:28.448
Such a shame.

01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.952
Dad.

01:14:13.994 --> 01:14:15.704
Look.

01:14:41.438 --> 01:14:43.732
Throw water on it.

01:14:44.691 --> 01:14:46.693
Will this land never clear.

01:14:46.735 --> 01:14:49.029
Carson, this land's
been blighted

01:14:49.070 --> 01:14:51.198
- since before you were born.
- I know.

01:14:53.783 --> 01:14:55.243
It's not your fault

01:14:55.285 --> 01:14:59.039
the company no longer
takes in refugees.

01:14:59.080 --> 01:15:03.168
It's not your fault
the rain won't fall.

01:15:03.210 --> 01:15:04.377
Sometimes I just wonder...

01:15:04.419 --> 01:15:06.880
I just wonder that
maybe I could've saved-

01:15:06.922 --> 01:15:08.632
- You have to kill them.
- I know.

01:15:08.673 --> 01:15:10.509
It's a mercy.

01:15:10.550 --> 01:15:12.928
- The vagrants only suffer.
- I know.

01:15:16.097 --> 01:15:19.684
I suppose if it wasn't me,
it'll just be someone else.

01:15:22.479 --> 01:15:25.065
I didn't want this for you.

01:15:25.106 --> 01:15:27.275
I know.

01:15:27.317 --> 01:15:29.569
We're almost done.

01:15:29.611 --> 01:15:31.404
Let's move on to the next farm.

01:15:31.446 --> 01:15:32.906
Yes.

01:15:32.948 --> 01:15:34.783
Cadiz can mark this one as ours.

01:15:34.824 --> 01:15:36.660
Good.
Mark it. Let's go.

01:15:36.701 --> 01:15:38.245
Of course.

01:15:38.286 --> 01:15:40.163
You two go on your way.

01:18:37.799 --> 01:18:39.426
Agh!

01:19:24.971 --> 01:19:26.431
Ah, fuck!

01:21:44.694 --> 01:21:46.070
Alby!

01:21:46.112 --> 01:21:47.822
It fits.

01:21:48.948 --> 01:21:51.242
Alby!

01:21:51.284 --> 01:21:53.036
Come on!
I got the cap for the plane.

01:21:53.077 --> 01:21:54.746
Let's go.

01:22:04.255 --> 01:22:06.090
No.

01:24:33.279 --> 01:24:34.572
Ah!

01:24:46.292 --> 01:24:47.543
Get the boys!

01:24:51.839 --> 01:24:53.382
Alby, hide.

01:24:55.927 --> 01:24:57.386
Agh!

01:25:10.650 --> 01:25:12.110
God! Blood!

01:25:15.613 --> 01:25:19.492
I must say,
I am pleased.

01:25:19.534 --> 01:25:24.580
Finally a holdout
has come to me,

01:25:24.622 --> 01:25:29.919
instead of cowering in your
hiding holes awaiting judgment.

01:25:29.961 --> 01:25:32.004
Take a look, Brooke.

01:25:32.046 --> 01:25:33.005
Look at her.

01:25:33.047 --> 01:25:34.924
Yes, father.

01:25:34.966 --> 01:25:36.467
Strong!

01:25:36.509 --> 01:25:38.427
You must be the very last one.

01:25:40.513 --> 01:25:43.724
The wells are all dry.
There's no one left.

01:25:43.766 --> 01:25:47.311
My legacy is complete.

01:25:47.353 --> 01:25:49.188
The valley's all yours, Brooke.

01:25:53.234 --> 01:25:54.569
Daddy...

01:25:54.610 --> 01:25:56.487
Come on,
come on.

01:25:58.322 --> 01:25:59.866
Be strong.

01:26:02.118 --> 01:26:04.078
Your future is secure.

01:26:07.665 --> 01:26:10.084
This is Carson land.

01:26:10.126 --> 01:26:12.044
Always was,
always will be.

01:26:12.086 --> 01:26:15.631
And it'll rain on
generations to come yet.

01:26:19.385 --> 01:26:21.429
I must apologize,

01:26:21.470 --> 01:26:24.348
I would love to leave you
in this world.

01:26:24.390 --> 01:26:29.437
But my daughter,

01:26:29.478 --> 01:26:32.231
she can't stand competition.

01:26:38.029 --> 01:26:39.405
Agh!

01:26:40.948 --> 01:26:42.366
Ah!

01:26:44.535 --> 01:26:46.412
Agh!

01:26:58.674 --> 01:27:00.593
It's just you and me now.

01:27:11.187 --> 01:27:14.357
See, just you and me.

01:28:21.590 --> 01:28:22.883
Agh!

01:29:08.596 --> 01:29:10.222
And Dean?

01:29:12.391 --> 01:29:14.685
He's going to
stay behind.
