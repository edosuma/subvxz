that was a real comfort.

00:14.890 --> 00:17.143
Right, that night in my car,
she was coming to show me her ring.

00:17.226 --> 00:19.270
I don't know what she was
gonna say to you,

00:19.353 --> 00:21.063
but I do know she wasn't gonna
show you any ring.

00:23.274 --> 00:25.151
He slipped the ring on your finger
when you were unconscious.

00:25.401 --> 00:27.820
-He's lying to you.
-It doesn't matter, because it's over.

00:28.112 --> 00:29.822
I'm sorry.
I should've done something.

00:29.905 --> 00:30.990
-No!
-Said something.

00:44.795 --> 00:47.298

00:47.381 --> 00:50.468

Early shift.

a little more of a laissez-faire approach.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.180

-Come on, spill the beans, please.

-No, come on, I didn't do that.

and an EKG.

03:22.953 --> 03:24.663
Also, a chest X-ray
and stick him for glucose.

-On it.
-Really, I'm good.

-Okay. It's okay. Get it out.
-Yeah.

03:39.970 --> 03:41.180
Get it out.

Give him two units of blood now,
and get GI down here to scope him.

What's up with his fangs?
Can't be natural, can they?

04:09.625 --> 04:11.961
I don't think so. It's odd.

and EKG come back.

06:02.946 --> 06:04.698

coming from.

I'm not seeing any other
major external traumas.

06:10.245 --> 06:11.955
Not sure if there's active
bleeding or not.

06:12.039 --> 06:13.791
Well, grab some saline and flush it out.

Okay, I can visualize the full wound.
It's a deep lac.

06:30.015 --> 06:31.225
Galea muscle's intact.

06:31.308 --> 06:33.560
Still a little bit of bleeding
from the skin edge.

-No. June, please.

as she's back from radiology. All right?

11:39.825 --> 11:41.827
Treated? What exactly does that entail?

11:42.411 --> 11:44.162
For starters,
I need to run some more tests

11:44.246 --> 11:46.248
to find out what's causing
the liver failure.

11:46.331 --> 11:48.458
No, unhook him from all of this.
We're going.

11:49.376 --> 11:50.419
Whoa...

11:50.502 --> 11:54.089
Wait a minute.
Tom, what do you want?

11:55.757 --> 11:57.259
Get up. We'll go.

11:59.428 --> 12:00.804
I wanna leave.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.766
I strongly advise you not to.

12:06.059 --> 12:08.103
Let's go, Tom. Get up.

12:09.729 --> 12:13.692
Hold on, before you can leave,
you have to sign an AMA form.

12:13.775 --> 12:15.026
Then get it.

12:22.951 --> 12:23.994
(GINA GROANS)

12:24.953 --> 12:27.873
It took me three months
just to tap my finger.

12:28.623 --> 12:30.125
It's a frustrating process.

12:30.792 --> 12:32.043
For a while there, it felt like
I'd signed up

12:32.127 --> 12:34.004
for a billion-dollar backscratcher.

12:34.588 --> 12:36.047
You seem pretty well-acclimated now.

12:36.840 --> 12:39.176
Yeah, now.

12:40.260 --> 12:42.429
Sucks getting trapped
under an exploded Humvee,

12:42.512 --> 12:45.265
but it's pretty cool I get to be
the Bionic Woman.

12:46.141 --> 12:49.019
Let's start Gina on IV clindamycin,
600 milligrams.

12:49.102 --> 12:50.395
My doc had me on Augmentin.

12:50.479 --> 12:52.063
Let's try something a little different.

12:52.147 --> 12:53.440
Let's get a CT scan, too,

12:53.523 --> 12:55.775
see if the infection has spread
into any deep spaces.

12:55.859 --> 12:57.903
-Okay.
-What if it has?

12:57.986 --> 13:00.155
Could require surgery to clean it out.

13:00.238 --> 13:02.657
Who's your doctor at Walter Reed?
I need to loop them in.

13:03.492 --> 13:04.951
It's Dr. Flanagan.

13:05.911 --> 13:06.953
Um...

13:07.329 --> 13:10.290
But the thing is, I flew in this weekend
for my sister's wedding.

13:11.082 --> 13:12.751
I wasn't really supposed to travel.

13:13.335 --> 13:15.337
The Army doesn't like their toys
taken out of the box.

13:16.713 --> 13:18.673
So, they don't even know you're here.

13:19.508 --> 13:20.550
You're AWOL.

13:21.718 --> 13:24.638
I know how it sounds,
but it's my little sister's wedding

13:24.721 --> 13:26.890
and I'm her maid of honor.

13:26.973 --> 13:29.017
I'll be back in Bethesda
first thing Monday.

13:31.895 --> 13:34.898
I'd really appreciate if we could keep
the military out of this if possible.

13:35.815 --> 13:37.484
We'll respect your privacy.

13:41.571 --> 13:44.699
BEN: It's like I tell all
my students at the start of each year.

13:44.783 --> 13:48.954
''It won't always be easy,
but it will be worth it in the end.''

13:49.996 --> 13:51.206
And does that work on them?

13:52.541 --> 13:56.002
Not really. Ten-year-olds have a hard time
seeing past recess.

13:56.753 --> 13:58.338
But I say it anyway,

13:58.421 --> 14:00.632
just to remind myself
as the school year rolls on.

14:00.715 --> 14:04.094
Excuse me, I'm sorry.
Can I get either of you anything?

14:04.177 --> 14:05.637
No, thanks. I'm good, CeCe.

14:05.720 --> 14:07.556
Okay, we have some really good cookies.

14:07.639 --> 14:10.308
We have chocolate chip,
we have macadamia...

14:10.392 --> 14:12.852
-I think I'll take one of those.
-Okay, right over there.

14:12.936 --> 14:16.898
-Yeah, maybe I'll stretch my legs.
-CAROLINE: All right.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.611
(CAROLINE CHUCKLES)

14:23.238 --> 14:24.739
I cannot believe
you're not breaking a sweat.

14:25.323 --> 14:26.324
Why?

14:26.408 --> 14:28.410
I'm having a hot flash
just watching y'all two.

14:28.493 --> 14:30.745
-Oh, CeCe...
-Did you ask him out yet?

14:30.829 --> 14:33.999
I'm not gonna hit on some guy
getting chemotherapy next to me.

14:34.082 --> 14:36.960
Technically, you've been hitting on him
the entire time.

14:37.043 --> 14:39.170
CeCe, this is not the place
to meet somebody.

14:39.254 --> 14:42.424
Okay, so, if you met him in a Starbucks,
would you ask him out then?

14:43.008 --> 14:44.217
CeCe, please.

14:44.301 --> 14:47.178
Look, I'm not telling you your business,
but that man is fine as hell.

14:47.262 --> 14:50.181
Ask him out.
What are you waiting for?

14:54.311 --> 14:59.107
I couldn't decide on which one to get,
so, I thought maybe,

14:59.190 --> 15:03.153
if you'd be willing to share,
we could both live like kings.

15:03.903 --> 15:04.988
What do you say?

15:05.989 --> 15:07.032
MAGGIE: Mmm.

15:10.160 --> 15:11.286
Thank you.

15:14.831 --> 15:17.792
You know, I should probably eat
an actual lunch after this.

15:18.960 --> 15:20.128
But

15:21.504 --> 15:22.547
problem is...

15:25.884 --> 15:27.260
What's the problem?

15:30.013 --> 15:31.097
I don't like to eat alone.

15:33.183 --> 15:35.060
What are you up to?

15:35.143 --> 15:36.436
Stop...

15:36.519 --> 15:37.979
(BOTH CHUCKLE)

15:38.063 --> 15:39.314
(MACHINE BEEPING)

15:39.397 --> 15:41.483
Something's wrong! Help!

15:41.566 --> 15:43.526
Someone, please get in here!

15:45.528 --> 15:47.322
-ELSA: Sats are down to 84.
-Kayla?

15:47.906 --> 15:49.824
Kayla? Her GCS is worse.

15:50.784 --> 15:52.243
She's not protecting her airway.

15:52.327 --> 15:54.162
All right, bag her
while I get an intubation kit.

15:54.245 --> 15:55.413
What does that mean?
What's happening?

15:55.497 --> 15:57.582
She's not breathing on her own
and she needs help.

15:57.666 --> 15:59.125
Ms. Patten, why don't you come with me?

15:59.209 --> 16:00.210
I'm not leaving her.

16:00.293 --> 16:02.212
Please, let's give the doctors
some room.

16:02.295 --> 16:03.338
Hyperventilate her.

16:07.217 --> 16:08.802
Sats are going back up.

16:08.885 --> 16:10.470
All right, good. Why don't you intubate?

16:11.137 --> 16:12.764
Etomidate and sux.

16:18.269 --> 16:19.938
-NATALIE: Are you ready?
-ELSA: Yep.

16:20.522 --> 16:22.315
Pressing and lifting.

16:22.399 --> 16:24.609
Okay, you see the cords?

16:25.694 --> 16:26.945
No...

16:27.028 --> 16:28.488
NATALIE: Get the tube. I'll hold down.

16:30.198 --> 16:33.076
All right, go nice and slow, okay?
We've got time. Don't worry.

16:35.286 --> 16:36.913
-Push a little.
-Over there, yeah.

16:36.996 --> 16:38.123
-Okay, I'm in.
-All right.

16:40.125 --> 16:41.459
Bag her.

16:47.215 --> 16:48.425
Why are her sats dropping?

16:48.508 --> 16:50.677
Probably in the stomach. I'll do it.

16:50.760 --> 16:53.179
All right. Take off the bag.

16:57.183 --> 16:58.935
Yep, I'm in. Bag.

16:59.018 --> 17:03.022
Eighty-eight, 92, we're good.

17:03.106 --> 17:05.483
All right, get her on a vent
and get Mom back in here.

17:05.567 --> 17:07.277
Look, it was your first time
intubating a child.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.279
It happens. Don't beat yourself up.

17:09.362 --> 17:11.406
I'm not. I am a medical student.

17:11.489 --> 17:13.116
This is supposed to be
a learning experience.

17:26.963 --> 17:30.008
-Doc, could I curbside you for a minute?
-What's up?

17:30.091 --> 17:32.510
So, I've got this guy with liver failure
and hematemesis.

17:32.594 --> 17:33.762
Then his girlfriend shows up

17:33.845 --> 17:36.181
and insists he leave
without getting treatment.

17:36.765 --> 17:39.100
That's his choice, not hers, right?

17:39.184 --> 17:41.394
But he's going along with it.

17:41.478 --> 17:44.689
She's very "controlling",
is, I think, the word you'd use.

17:44.773 --> 17:47.650
Okay, well, I mean, if he wants to leave,

17:47.734 --> 17:49.652
there's not really a whole lot
we can do about it, right?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.488
No, you're right,

17:51.571 --> 17:53.239
but there's something odd going on
with these two.

17:53.323 --> 17:55.909
They have these pointy teeth,
like really sharp.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.036
Implants or something.

17:58.828 --> 18:02.081
Okay, well, now I'm interested.

18:06.419 --> 18:07.587
Gina's CT scans.

18:07.670 --> 18:10.548
It's an abscess where the tissue
meets the prosthetic.

18:10.632 --> 18:12.425
It'll require surgical drainage.

18:12.509 --> 18:14.636
Yeah, but let's hold off
before scheduling anything.

18:14.719 --> 18:15.720
Why?

18:15.804 --> 18:18.515
I called her doctor at Walter Reed.
He's coming out to take a look.

18:18.598 --> 18:22.227
Ethan, what? She asked us to keep
the military out of this.

18:22.310 --> 18:24.604
-It's not about that.
-She's AWOL.

18:24.687 --> 18:28.191
Look, April,
I didn't wanna make the call.

18:28.274 --> 18:30.652
But Gina's health has to take priority.

18:30.735 --> 18:32.779
Her prosthetic is such
a specialized piece,

18:32.862 --> 18:35.740
I need her doctor's input
before having it operated on.

18:35.824 --> 18:37.450
But you violated her HIPAA rights.

18:37.534 --> 18:41.079
Actually, HIPAA makes an
allowance for situations just like this.

18:41.162 --> 18:44.958
We would contact the manufacturer
of a prosthetic in any other scenario.

18:45.041 --> 18:48.753
But in this case, the manufacturer
just so happens to be the military.

18:49.546 --> 18:51.089
What's that supposed to mean?

18:51.172 --> 18:53.466
Maybe you can get a little
overzealous when it comes to the military.

18:54.592 --> 18:57.470
I'm just trying to keep Gina
from losing her arm a second time.

19:01.307 --> 19:03.059
What's the worst that could happen?
I die?

19:03.142 --> 19:05.478
If you leave, it's a very
real possibility.

19:05.562 --> 19:08.231
-Look, shut up, Tom. Get up, we're going.
-Whoa, hey.

19:11.985 --> 19:12.986
Tom!

19:14.445 --> 19:16.364
If your liver fails,
your brain will deteriorate.

19:16.447 --> 19:18.575
Your entire body will swell up
and you will most likely

19:18.658 --> 19:19.951
bleed into your stomach again.

19:20.034 --> 19:21.953
-And that will kill you.
-But I'm already dead.

19:22.036 --> 19:23.371
Tom, don't.

19:23.454 --> 19:25.290
-I'm a vampire!
-Okay, hold on.

19:25.874 --> 19:27.417
-Get out of our way!
-I can't do that.

19:27.500 --> 19:28.626
I gotta keep you at the hospital.

19:28.710 --> 19:30.670
I'm putting you
on an involuntary psychiatric...

19:30.753 --> 19:31.796
Hey!

19:32.255 --> 19:34.382
-Let me see it.
-Go get them.

19:34.465 --> 19:36.926
Security, stop them!

19:38.761 --> 19:42.056
Hey, hey, come back here!

19:43.391 --> 19:44.809
Whoa, stay right there!

19:51.357 --> 19:52.734
(SCREAMING)

19:52.817 --> 19:54.611
Whoa. Get him out of the sun!

20:06.414 --> 20:07.874
(WINCES)

20:07.957 --> 20:09.584
-I'd treat it with Silvadene.
-Yeah.

20:10.501 --> 20:14.797
This is why I wear a hood.
Vampires can't be out in the sun.

20:14.881 --> 20:16.507
Tom, there are medical explanations

20:16.591 --> 20:19.052
for why this is happening to you
and I can figure this out,

20:19.135 --> 20:20.637
if you just let me take
another blood sample.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.722
So you can experiment on me?

20:22.805 --> 20:24.807
This is exactly
what Kirsten said you'd do.

20:24.891 --> 20:26.517
What did she tell you, Tom?

20:26.601 --> 20:27.936
That you'd parade me out in the news,

20:28.019 --> 20:31.522
claiming to be the doctors
who discovered and cured a vampire.

20:31.606 --> 20:34.233
No, we're not gonna do that.
We just want you to get better.

20:34.984 --> 20:36.903
As a vampire,
I get to live like a god.

20:37.779 --> 20:39.781
Long after you become worm food,

20:39.864 --> 20:42.450
Kirsten and I will just be starting
our next chapter together.

20:42.533 --> 20:45.411
-Look, Tom...
-Will, could I get a minute?

20:52.168 --> 20:53.378
What is with this kid?

20:53.461 --> 20:56.005
Look, he's submissive.
He's impressionable.

20:56.089 --> 20:57.465
She's essentially brainwashed him.

20:57.548 --> 20:59.217
As far as he's concerned, he's a vampire.

20:59.300 --> 21:01.594
Trying to reason with him,
it's a waste of time.

21:01.678 --> 21:02.720
Could even be counterproductive.

21:02.804 --> 21:04.847
Fine, but he's on a psych hold.
Can't you medicate him?

21:04.931 --> 21:08.643
Not unless he becomes acutely dangerous,
or we got a court order.

21:08.726 --> 21:10.937
He vomited a pint of blood
this morning.

21:11.020 --> 21:13.398
He's going to bleed again
and it will kill him.

21:14.440 --> 21:15.525
(SIGHS)

21:16.818 --> 21:20.113
I never thought I would ever eat
at the Rainforest Cafe.

21:20.196 --> 21:21.781
(BOTH LAUGH)

21:22.615 --> 21:23.866
Since I got diagnosed,

21:23.950 --> 21:26.285
I've been trying to live more
like my fourth graders.

21:26.369 --> 21:28.204
Not a care in the world.

21:28.287 --> 21:31.290
-All they wanna do is have fun.
-Yeah.

21:31.374 --> 21:34.711
But I should quit taking restaurant
tips from them.

21:34.794 --> 21:38.006
-(SQUEALS) Maybe.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

21:38.923 --> 21:41.426
Well, this is me.

21:44.554 --> 21:46.347
I had a lot of fun today, Maggie.

21:46.431 --> 21:47.807
Yeah.

21:48.933 --> 21:50.435
Me, too.

21:53.771 --> 21:59.110
Listen, um, I'm throwing a party
with a friend from the hospital tonight.

22:00.695 --> 22:01.904
A crawfish boil.

22:03.614 --> 22:06.743
You should come.
If you're feeling up to it.

22:06.826 --> 22:09.829
Are you kidding me?
With this rocket fuel in my veins.

22:09.912 --> 22:11.122
(LAUGHS)

22:11.914 --> 22:14.042
It does feel pretty good.

22:14.125 --> 22:16.711
You know, I appreciate
the offer, Maggie,

22:16.794 --> 22:18.379
but I really don't wanna impose.

22:18.463 --> 22:20.048
No, please.

22:23.426 --> 22:26.596
-I want you to come.
-Okay.

22:27.847 --> 22:28.890
I'd like that.

22:30.641 --> 22:31.934
Okay.

22:33.269 --> 22:36.647
Actually, I'm supposed
to make some jambalaya for the party.

22:36.731 --> 22:38.191
I could use an extra set of hands.

22:39.150 --> 22:41.360
-I got hands.
-(BOTH LAUGH)

22:42.361 --> 22:44.906
Okay, then. Come on in.

22:52.288 --> 22:54.665
I'm Dr. Choi. I called about
Sergeant Gina Todd.

22:54.749 --> 22:55.833
Dr. Choi, I'm Captain Sims.

22:55.917 --> 22:58.503
This is Officer Miller and Officer Campo,
Military Police.

22:58.586 --> 22:59.837
Military Police?

23:00.421 --> 23:01.964
I thought you said you called a doctor.

23:02.048 --> 23:03.424
I was expecting Dr. Flanagan.

23:03.508 --> 23:04.884
I don't know anything about that.

23:04.967 --> 23:06.677
We just came straight from Fort McCoy.

23:06.761 --> 23:09.305
Our orders are to transport Sergeant Todd
back to Walter Reed.

23:09.388 --> 23:11.682
As Gina's doctor, I need to know
the plan for her treatment.

23:11.766 --> 23:14.018
Any decisions pertaining to
Todd's care are classified.

23:14.102 --> 23:16.646
Dr. Choi, Treatment 5 needs you.

23:16.729 --> 23:17.772
Excuse us.

23:19.148 --> 23:22.235
(MACHINES BEEPING)

23:22.318 --> 23:23.444
She's hypotensive.

23:23.528 --> 23:25.446
And her fever is spiking.
She's in septic shock.

23:25.530 --> 23:27.031
Bolus a liter of saline.

23:28.116 --> 23:29.951
Not getting a good flow. Her IV's blown.

23:30.034 --> 23:31.077
Do you want to put a central line in?

23:31.160 --> 23:32.578
No, I'm gonna drill an IO in her leg.

23:32.662 --> 23:34.747
-It'll be faster.
-Okay.

23:49.428 --> 23:50.471
Okay, open up the fluids.

23:50.555 --> 23:53.099
Mmm-hmm.
Okay, much better.

23:53.182 --> 23:54.642
All right, she's stable, but she's septic.

23:54.725 --> 23:56.519
Give her a second liter and hang Levophed.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.564
I'm transferring Gina up to one of our
operating rooms.

23:59.647 --> 24:01.315
Her abscess needs to be drained
immediately.

24:01.399 --> 24:04.569
Sorry, Dr. Choi, but Sergeant Todd
is headed back to Walter Reed with us.

24:04.652 --> 24:05.778
Helicopter's already on the way.

24:05.862 --> 24:07.989
And how long will it take to get there?
Three hours? It's too risky.

24:08.072 --> 24:10.324
Gina has an infection in her blood.
She needs surgery now.

24:10.408 --> 24:12.493
We'll let the doctors
at Walter Reed decide that.

24:12.577 --> 24:14.287
I assure you, they would agree.

24:14.370 --> 24:15.997
This patient is not going anywhere.

24:16.080 --> 24:18.583
I have orders. I intend to follow them.

24:18.666 --> 24:20.251
I'm getting Ms. Goodwin.

24:22.670 --> 24:24.547
ABRAMS: So, after hitting the front
and back of her head,

24:24.630 --> 24:27.175
she has what we call a coup
contrecoup injury.

24:27.258 --> 24:29.635
The foci are small,
but they're cumulative.

24:29.719 --> 24:31.470
I don't understand.

24:31.554 --> 24:34.140
Kayla has multiple small bruises
in her brain,

24:34.223 --> 24:36.642
but none of them are big enough for me
to drill and evacuate.

24:36.726 --> 24:38.686
So, what can be done?

24:39.645 --> 24:40.730
Nothing.

24:41.355 --> 24:43.357
Hopefully, with time,
they'll resolve on their own.

24:43.441 --> 24:45.443
I'm sorry I don't have anything
else to offer.

24:47.904 --> 24:48.946
(SOBS)

24:49.947 --> 24:52.241
You know, there are some things
we can try

24:52.325 --> 24:55.286
to stop the bleeding
from causing problems.

24:55.369 --> 24:57.538
We can raise the head of Kayla's bed

24:57.622 --> 25:00.833
and give her mannitol to decrease
intracranial pressure.

25:00.917 --> 25:02.335
Do you think it will work?

25:02.418 --> 25:06.923
Statistically, it has maybe a 25% chance
of changing her outcome.

25:07.757 --> 25:08.925
Oh, God.

25:09.425 --> 25:12.678
Hey, I have seen
this treatment work before.

25:15.681 --> 25:16.682
Ms. Curry?

25:21.771 --> 25:23.481
Why would you say that to her?

25:23.564 --> 25:25.483
Because it's the truth. She asked.

25:25.566 --> 25:29.779
No, what she was asking for is hope,
not grim statistics.

25:29.862 --> 25:30.863
How do you know that?

25:30.947 --> 25:33.908
Trust me, that's what she
was asking for.

25:38.955 --> 25:42.541
Our job is to look out
for the best interests of our patients.

25:42.625 --> 25:44.877
I'm sorry you had to come
all the way down here.

25:44.961 --> 25:46.295
You shouldn't even be here.

25:46.379 --> 25:50.174
Look, Sergeant Todd isn't just another one
of your hospital patients.

25:50.258 --> 25:52.218
She's part of a special DARPA project.

25:52.301 --> 25:53.594
They've invested a lot of time

25:53.678 --> 25:56.097
and taxpayer dollars
into Gina and her arm.

25:56.180 --> 25:59.016
Unfortunately, Captain,
this isn't a military base.

25:59.100 --> 26:00.893
You don't have jurisdiction here.

26:00.977 --> 26:02.937
And if you want to move this patient,

26:03.020 --> 26:06.732
you'll need a judge's court order and the
local police to do it.

26:06.816 --> 26:09.151
We'll have all our ducks in a row
by the time our chopper arrives.

26:09.235 --> 26:12.780
Until then, out of consideration
of our other patients,

26:12.863 --> 26:16.826
do you mind stepping
into the waiting room? Thank you.

26:18.869 --> 26:21.872
Ms. Goodwin, we cannot let them take her.
She's septic.

26:21.956 --> 26:23.624
Well, what can be done right now?

26:23.708 --> 26:26.419
If we can drain her abscess,
we can remove the source of her infection.

26:26.502 --> 26:27.795
But I will need a surgeon to do it.

26:27.878 --> 26:29.672
I can take her up to the surgical floor
in the meantime.

26:29.755 --> 26:32.925
Well, move fast, because if they get
that court order,

26:33.009 --> 26:36.304
there's nothing that any of us
can do to stop them.

26:44.645 --> 26:47.606
Hey, I'm worried about this.
I'm gonna be fine.

26:47.690 --> 26:50.735
Took a bunch of antibiotics, you know,
a fistful of ibuprofen.

26:50.818 --> 26:51.944
I can't feel a thing.

26:52.028 --> 26:53.738
I get the feeling it's gonna be
a late night.

26:53.821 --> 26:55.323
Maybe we should cancel our reservation.

26:55.406 --> 26:57.742
No way. Alinea, are you kidding me?

26:57.825 --> 26:59.368
We could get another dinner reservation,

26:59.452 --> 27:01.704
but who knows when you're gonna get
another vampire in the ED?

27:01.787 --> 27:03.873
If only I could figure out
how to talk to this guy,

27:03.956 --> 27:06.334
-how to get through to him.
-You can talk to anybody.

27:06.417 --> 27:08.419
That's why I love you so much.
Even vampires.

27:13.424 --> 27:15.718
-What?
-Keep the reservation.

27:15.801 --> 27:17.219
(CHUCKLES)

27:19.638 --> 27:22.975
First of all, Tom,
I would like to apologize.

27:23.059 --> 27:24.769
Clearly, you are a vampire.

27:24.852 --> 27:27.063
It's just that we've never
treated one before,

27:27.146 --> 27:28.564
and so, it's our mistake.

27:28.647 --> 27:31.317
And I'm sorry.
You must be getting hungry.

27:31.400 --> 27:33.778
Would you like me to contact
the blood bank or...

27:33.861 --> 27:35.571
You're messing with me.

27:38.074 --> 27:39.742
It's just like Kirsten said.

27:40.951 --> 27:42.453
Doctors can't be trusted.

27:42.536 --> 27:44.538
Yeah, Kirsten. Where's Kirsten?

27:44.622 --> 27:46.040
Is she out in the waiting room?

27:46.123 --> 27:48.417
No. She left.

27:48.834 --> 27:52.880
Tom, do you mind me asking how long
have you two been together?

27:53.714 --> 27:56.092
Eight, nine months.

27:56.175 --> 27:58.719
I'm just curious because, well,

27:59.595 --> 28:03.724
I mean, if you'll forgive me,
it seems like she kind of abandoned you.

28:03.808 --> 28:05.476
She had to.

28:05.559 --> 28:07.728
But to the very people who she said
were so dangerous?

28:07.812 --> 28:08.896
You chased her away!

28:10.648 --> 28:12.233
She'll come back for me.

28:13.859 --> 28:15.694
-Tonight
-Well, hopefully,

28:15.820 --> 28:19.198
but I mean, even if she does,
doesn't it bother you a bit that,

28:19.281 --> 28:21.367
I don't know, that she put
herself first?

28:22.701 --> 28:26.080
I think you deserve someone
who puts you first.

28:27.206 --> 28:30.543
You know? I mean, someone who loves you.

28:30.626 --> 28:32.711
Because if Kirsten did...

28:33.546 --> 28:37.007
I mean, I don't know. Why isn't she here?

28:40.719 --> 28:44.473
Give us a chance to help you.
Let me run some tests.

28:52.690 --> 28:54.900
I just pulled a 14-hour shift.

28:54.984 --> 28:56.110
Can't someone from ortho do it?

28:56.193 --> 28:59.238
Already tried, but they say
it's a soft tissue general surgery case.

28:59.321 --> 29:00.739
Crockett, please.

29:00.823 --> 29:04.410
We are one court order away from losing
this patient to the Military Police.

29:04.493 --> 29:05.870
We have minutes, not hours.

29:06.454 --> 29:07.538
Us versus them, huh?

29:08.998 --> 29:10.332
Will you assist?

29:12.084 --> 29:13.586
All right, then. Let's go.

29:13.669 --> 29:15.004
Game on.

29:16.380 --> 29:18.757
-(MACHINES BEEPING)
-(CRYING)

29:18.841 --> 29:20.050
Now, what's happening?

29:20.134 --> 29:23.012
Blood pressure's 200 over 70,
heart rate's 40s.

29:23.095 --> 29:24.138
She's going to arrest. Call a code.

29:24.221 --> 29:26.140
-Code Blue!
-Please, do something.

29:26.223 --> 29:27.308
-Help her!
-Ms. Patten...

29:27.391 --> 29:28.601
No, I won't go!

29:28.684 --> 29:30.895
-It's okay. It's okay.
-She's bradying.

29:30.978 --> 29:33.272
Swelling must be causing increased
intracranial pressure.

29:33.355 --> 29:34.356
Take her off the vent and bag her.

29:34.440 --> 29:35.441
-Cushing reflex?
-NATALIE: Yep.

29:35.524 --> 29:38.152
-Do something!
-NATALIE: We're doing everything we can.

29:38.235 --> 29:39.236
I can't find a pulse.

29:39.320 --> 29:41.071
She's asystole on the monitor.
I'm starting compressions.

29:41.155 --> 29:42.364
Milligram of epi.

29:42.448 --> 29:44.200
I can't believe this is happening!

29:46.744 --> 29:49.163
Please, Kayla, please. (SOBS)

29:49.955 --> 29:51.207
NATALIE: Hold compressions.

29:51.957 --> 29:53.876
-JUNE: Come on, baby.
-Still no pulse.

29:53.959 --> 29:56.504
Continue compressions.
Another milligram of epi.

29:56.587 --> 29:58.297
Baby, please. Come on...

29:59.965 --> 30:03.844
Kayla, please, please. No... Please...

30:03.928 --> 30:06.472
Pupils are blown. Stop compressions.

30:07.598 --> 30:08.933
What?

30:10.518 --> 30:12.978
Don't stop! Why are you stopping?

30:13.062 --> 30:14.438
She's still asystole.

30:16.106 --> 30:19.235
Her brain has herniated.
I am so sorry, June.

30:20.236 --> 30:21.737
No!

30:21.820 --> 30:23.739
Time of death, 16:08.

30:23.822 --> 30:25.824
No! No!

30:25.908 --> 30:29.328
-I'm so sorry.
-No! (CRYING)

30:33.207 --> 30:36.085
No, no, no!

30:36.168 --> 30:38.420
(CRYING)

30:42.675 --> 30:45.177
I've received word
Captain Sims got her court order.

30:45.261 --> 30:48.681
A military helicopter is touching down
on the helipad now.

30:48.764 --> 30:50.349
-Thanks for the heads up.
-All right.

30:51.642 --> 30:52.685
-Hey.
-Yeah?

30:52.768 --> 30:54.103
MPs are moments away
from pulling the plug.

30:54.186 --> 30:55.396
How far off are you?

30:55.479 --> 30:58.232
I gotta finish scrubbing,
gown, and glove up. I'd say five minutes.

30:58.315 --> 30:59.900
I'll try to buy you some time.

31:12.746 --> 31:13.872
Captain!

31:14.790 --> 31:15.874
Here's a court order, Dr. Choi.

31:15.958 --> 31:18.419
Sorry, you and your crew have to wait.
Sergeant Todd is already in surgery.

31:18.502 --> 31:20.296
Then we'll get her out.
The procedure won't take long.

31:20.379 --> 31:22.673
You'll be on your way
in a little over an hour, tops.

31:22.756 --> 31:25.259
Your role in this is over. Step aside.

31:25.342 --> 31:27.595
You interrupt that surgery
and you'll be putting Gina's life at risk.

31:27.678 --> 31:29.555
I have my orders to bring her back ASAP.

31:29.638 --> 31:31.098
Are your orders to bring her
back dead?

31:31.181 --> 31:32.600
Because that's exactly
what you'll be doing.

31:33.434 --> 31:35.102
We'll see what DOD says.

31:48.616 --> 31:50.534
Thank you for sticking around
to do this.

31:50.618 --> 31:53.203
I can refuse you nothing,
Nurse Sexton.

31:53.287 --> 31:54.747
Irrigation.

31:54.830 --> 31:57.291
You're not really here because of me.

31:57.374 --> 32:00.878
Well... I do love a good race.

32:00.961 --> 32:02.463
You ever had a Sazerac, Sexton?

32:02.546 --> 32:04.590
What is that?

32:04.673 --> 32:07.551
My favorite cocktail. New Orleans special.

32:08.302 --> 32:09.845
I'll make you one tonight.

32:14.558 --> 32:15.809
Hey, Tom?

32:17.061 --> 32:18.228
What can I do for you?

32:19.730 --> 32:23.859
I'm not feeling good. I'm sick.

32:24.652 --> 32:26.403
Yes, you are.

32:26.487 --> 32:29.031
And I can help,
but only if you'll let me.

32:29.698 --> 32:31.408
I've been texting Kirsten.

32:33.077 --> 32:34.662
She's not answering.

32:35.287 --> 32:37.706
When I call, it goes
straight to voicemail.

32:38.332 --> 32:39.958
I think she blocked me.

32:48.884 --> 32:50.886
She's not coming back, is she?

32:53.555 --> 32:54.932
I'm sorry.

32:58.769 --> 33:01.522
I never felt more alive
than when I was with her.

33:03.273 --> 33:06.318
Imagine the most exciting woman
you ever met choosing you

33:06.402 --> 33:09.363
to go with her on an extraordinary trip

33:10.406 --> 33:12.282
that lasts forever.

33:15.160 --> 33:16.370
Must have felt pretty special.

33:16.453 --> 33:17.496
(CHUCKLES)

33:18.455 --> 33:21.417
She could've picked anyone,
but she picked me.

33:24.169 --> 33:25.671
And now...

33:27.548 --> 33:30.551
This is probably hard
for you to understand.

33:30.634 --> 33:34.346
Actually, Tom, I know exactly
where you're coming from.

33:35.180 --> 33:36.473
Was it all a lie?

33:40.227 --> 33:42.271
I feel so stupid.

33:44.898 --> 33:47.401
How about we focus on getting you
feeling better?

33:48.569 --> 33:50.362
Okay.

33:51.905 --> 33:53.323
Okay.

34:01.999 --> 34:05.085
So, the abscess was drained.
No damage to the prosthetic,

34:05.169 --> 34:07.963
and hopefully not the patient's
implanted nerve endings.

34:08.046 --> 34:11.341
Thank you, Dr. Marcel. Captain Sims
and her team will be transporting

34:11.425 --> 34:13.260
Sergeant Todd to Walter Reed
via helicopter immediately.

34:13.844 --> 34:15.345
Okay, just make sure the patient receives

34:15.429 --> 34:19.057
the proper post-op fluids
and meds in transit, okay? All right.

34:31.612 --> 34:33.322
APRIL: That poor woman.

34:34.448 --> 34:35.991
She's gonna pull through.

34:36.074 --> 34:39.244
Yeah, but we have no idea
what the Army will do to her.

34:41.330 --> 34:43.040
It didn't have to go down
like this, Ethan.

34:44.208 --> 34:45.876
If you had just listened.

34:54.635 --> 34:56.136
Elsa?

34:57.888 --> 34:58.889
You okay?

35:00.307 --> 35:02.142
People make assumptions about me.

35:02.601 --> 35:05.479
Okay, but they're wrong.
I mean, I'm not some kind of a robot.

35:05.562 --> 35:06.688
I have feelings.

35:06.772 --> 35:09.274
Okay, well, that's a good thing.

35:09.358 --> 35:10.526
No, you don't understand.

35:11.401 --> 35:14.655
They're so powerful,

35:14.738 --> 35:17.825
I feel like if I didn't hold them all in,
I have no idea what would happen.

35:18.534 --> 35:20.410
You're afraid of being overwhelmed?

35:20.494 --> 35:23.914
Yes, yes. I couldn't stand watching
that mother lose her daughter today.

35:24.790 --> 35:27.000
I do understand, Elsa.

35:27.084 --> 35:29.795
But those feelings
that seem so frightening,

35:29.878 --> 35:33.507
ultimately, they will become
one of your greatest assets as a doctor.

35:33.590 --> 35:34.633
(SIGHS)

35:35.384 --> 35:36.885
I don't know.

35:41.431 --> 35:43.475
What have you got going on tonight?

35:43.559 --> 35:46.603
CeCe got reservations at Alinea.
I think I might just make it, too.

35:46.687 --> 35:49.147
-Any luck?
-Tom has hepatitis C.

35:49.815 --> 35:50.858
You got him to take the test?

35:50.941 --> 35:53.360
He needed a little more time to think
about what you said.

35:53.443 --> 35:54.486
Huh.

35:54.570 --> 35:55.654
Is this your vampire?

35:55.737 --> 35:57.990
Does that explain
why he blistered in the sun?

35:58.073 --> 35:59.825
Yes. Liver failure combined

35:59.908 --> 36:03.120
with hepatitis can cause
porphyria cutanea tarda.

36:03.203 --> 36:06.540
Makes it so sun exposure causes
painful skin lesions.

36:06.623 --> 36:09.126
And since hepatitis is transmitted
through bodily fluids,

36:09.710 --> 36:11.587
probably got it from having sex
with his girlfriend.

36:11.670 --> 36:14.923
Or from sucking her blood. Yikes.

36:15.007 --> 36:17.801
Wait, didn't that woman bite you?

36:17.885 --> 36:19.636
Yeah, Dr. Charles, you need to get tested.

36:19.720 --> 36:21.847
-First thing in the morning.
-Given the risk of transmission,

36:21.930 --> 36:23.473
you should have your blood drawn ASAP.

36:23.557 --> 36:25.392
-You mean like right now?
-Now.

36:25.475 --> 36:26.685
You're kidding me.

36:34.568 --> 36:38.113
Dr. Halstead, anything else?

36:38.196 --> 36:41.241
No, I'm gonna get Tom started
on antivirals.

36:47.539 --> 36:48.665
Come and get 'em!

36:48.749 --> 36:50.834
Don't be afraid to get
your hands dirty now!

36:55.130 --> 36:57.090
So sorry. Yeah.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.593
Oh!

36:59.676 --> 37:02.638
April, this is Ben, my date.

37:02.721 --> 37:04.723
-Hello, Ben. Nice to meet you.
-Nice to meet you.

37:04.806 --> 37:07.017
Oh! Maggie,
where's the jambalaya?

37:07.100 --> 37:08.185
Sorry, there isn't any,

37:08.268 --> 37:10.395
but I brought rotisserie chicken
already cooked.

37:10.479 --> 37:12.064
You realize that supermarket chicken

37:12.147 --> 37:14.024
is not generally served
at a crawfish boil?

37:15.525 --> 37:18.820
All right, well, glad I made extra
red beans and rice.

37:18.904 --> 37:20.155
Put 'em in the kitchen.
Let's go.

37:20.238 --> 37:21.990
-I got them.
-Thank you.

37:25.452 --> 37:28.330
After all the grief you gave us
this morning, you show up late?

37:30.123 --> 37:31.875
Got a little busy this afternoon.

37:31.959 --> 37:33.377
Oh!

37:33.460 --> 37:34.836
Not that busy.

37:36.171 --> 37:37.506
Maybe that busy.

37:38.966 --> 37:40.509
(CHUCKLES)

37:44.221 --> 37:45.222
(EXHALES)

37:46.682 --> 37:47.683
Hi, Elsa.

37:48.976 --> 37:49.977
Dr. Halstead.

37:50.060 --> 37:52.187
Oh, come on.
I think you can call me Will.

37:54.231 --> 37:55.232
Okay.

37:56.316 --> 37:57.317
So, how you doing?

37:58.610 --> 38:00.320
You don't have to be nice to me.

38:00.404 --> 38:01.488
I know.

38:02.906 --> 38:05.367
So, I've never been
to a crawfish boil before.

38:05.450 --> 38:06.910
I'm a little out of my element.

38:06.994 --> 38:08.036
Um...

38:08.120 --> 38:09.788
I can show you how to do it.

38:11.581 --> 38:16.670
Okay, so, as far as I understand it,
you pull off the head

38:16.753 --> 38:19.089
and then you squeeze the tail
to get the meat out.

38:19.673 --> 38:20.799
Wow...

38:20.882 --> 38:22.342
I take it you've been to a few of these.

38:22.968 --> 38:25.929
-It's all on YouTube.
-Good to know.

38:30.434 --> 38:34.187
I knew crawfish was spicy,
but my mouth is on fire.

38:34.271 --> 38:35.397
(CHUCKLES)

38:35.480 --> 38:37.399
A little bit of Sazerac should help.

38:38.233 --> 38:42.612
Absinthe rinse, rye, bitters, sugar.

38:43.113 --> 38:44.698
Ain't nothing to it.

38:50.954 --> 38:54.041
-So, how is it?
-It's good.

38:55.208 --> 38:56.376
It doesn't taste strong.

38:56.960 --> 38:58.587
I assure you, it is.

38:59.963 --> 39:01.006
Mmm.

39:02.758 --> 39:04.384
Okay, my lips are still tingling.

39:23.612 --> 39:25.280
(BREATHING SHAKILY)

39:27.991 --> 39:29.034
(SIGHS)

39:38.460 --> 39:39.544
Ethan.

39:40.545 --> 39:41.546
Hey.

39:42.756 --> 39:44.007
Can I talk to you?

39:58.688 --> 40:01.608
April, I'm sorry about today.

40:03.860 --> 40:05.779
You know I can be kind
of a hardass sometimes.

40:05.862 --> 40:08.240
And when I think I know
what should be done,

40:08.323 --> 40:10.325
I have trouble stepping back.

40:12.035 --> 40:13.286
Okay.

40:15.205 --> 40:17.165
What I'm saying is...

40:21.044 --> 40:22.379
I love you.

40:24.506 --> 40:27.134
And I need to respect your wishes.

40:27.884 --> 40:31.263
So, no more ovulation chart
or schedules.

40:32.013 --> 40:33.515
Let's just see what happens.

40:38.478 --> 40:39.980
Forgive me?

40:42.524 --> 40:43.650
Yes.
