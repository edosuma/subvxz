00:45.788 --> 00:47.054
Not that I know of.

00:47.122 --> 00:48.723
Let's go.

00:58.766 --> 01:01.968
[siren]

01:16.884 --> 01:18.617
So what was it?

01:18.685 --> 01:21.354
Severe allergic reaction.

01:22.923 --> 01:24.257
Oh, he did it on purpose.

01:24.325 --> 01:26.092
He's suicidal?

01:26.160 --> 01:28.127
He's homicidal.

01:28.195 --> 01:30.196
I've found there
ain't much difference.

01:30.264 --> 01:32.764
You know, I never have figured out
why they call you in.

01:32.832 --> 01:35.968
What's the point of saving
a scumbag like this?

01:36.035 --> 01:38.670
He'll only kill someone else
the second he gets a chance.

01:38.738 --> 01:40.138
That's above my pay grade.

01:40.206 --> 01:43.508
Overcrowded anyway.

01:43.576 --> 01:47.111
You think the taxpayers
want to save this idiot?

02:59.447 --> 03:02.149
[groaning]

03:04.618 --> 03:07.519
[gasps]

03:10.723 --> 03:12.959

03:17.897 --> 03:19.898
Don't you go doing
nothing stupid, boy.

03:19.967 --> 03:23.268
'Cause I'll tell you why.

03:23.336 --> 03:26.938
They'll never let you
out of that damn hole again.

03:27.873 --> 03:32.310
Put...it...down.

03:37.850 --> 03:39.216
That's it.

03:52.563 --> 03:54.365
Yeah.

03:54.432 --> 03:56.132
[grunts]

04:01.205 --> 04:03.506
That's it, boy.

04:04.741 --> 04:06.109
That's it.

04:06.176 --> 04:08.544
Uhh! Uhh...

04:26.062 --> 04:29.330
Ok, you never give your vote on
who should get what.

04:29.398 --> 04:30.797
Give Reid the mug.

04:30.865 --> 04:32.966
Really? That means that JJ gets
the double-decker bus?

04:33.035 --> 04:34.468
I thought that
was for Kevin.

04:34.536 --> 04:35.836
No, we're not talking
right now.

04:35.904 --> 04:38.472
Garcia, you guys
were just talking yest--

04:38.540 --> 04:40.007
never mind.

04:40.075 --> 04:42.076
Wait, where is everybody?

04:42.144 --> 04:44.710
Don't tell me
they're still in Seattle.

04:44.778 --> 04:47.347
Hi! Hey!
You guys are back. Hi.

04:47.415 --> 04:49.049
Oh, my made it.
Give me a squeeze.

04:49.116 --> 04:50.383
Oh, you guys look great.

04:50.451 --> 04:51.884
[English accent] Cheers.
How's it going?

04:51.952 --> 04:52.952
How's Emily doing?

04:53.020 --> 04:54.587
Brilliant and lovely.

04:54.655 --> 04:56.189
Her apartment's
off the chain.

04:56.257 --> 04:57.490
You mean her flat.

04:57.558 --> 04:59.058
You have to take a shaky old lift
to get to the top,

04:59.125 --> 05:00.725
but the view
is brilliant.

05:00.793 --> 05:02.061
For my favorite bloke.

05:02.128 --> 05:03.695
Hey, I love it!
Thank you!

05:03.729 --> 05:04.663
Thanks.
How was temporary duty?

05:04.730 --> 05:06.165
Oh, it was around the clock.

05:06.232 --> 05:08.467
I thought I'd get a little
more of a vacation, but...

05:08.535 --> 05:09.801
Did you watch
the Olympics at all?

05:09.869 --> 05:10.869
I did see a little
track and field,

05:10.937 --> 05:12.504
but the queen bee here,
she saw everything.

05:12.572 --> 05:15.173
Emily is for real hooked up
over there.

05:15.240 --> 05:17.141
She sends her love. And tea
of the month starts next week.

05:17.209 --> 05:18.409
Ohh. I miss her.

05:18.477 --> 05:20.078
Don't even get me started.

05:20.145 --> 05:22.012
Hey, how's the new?
Is she nice?

05:22.081 --> 05:22.947
Yeah, she is.

05:23.014 --> 05:24.515
I'm just asking.
Reid, do you know

05:24.583 --> 05:25.950
when she was recruited
she was 24?

05:26.017 --> 05:28.419
I've guest lectured in her
forensic linguistics class before.

05:28.487 --> 05:30.321
Of course you have, 'cause she's
a professor and an agent,

05:30.389 --> 05:31.421
which is so impressive.

05:31.489 --> 05:33.190
Mm-hmm.
No, really, she's great.

05:33.257 --> 05:34.357
And driven, clearly.

05:34.425 --> 05:36.493
Berkeley grad,
double major, Bureau star

05:36.561 --> 05:38.195
of the Unabomber case.
And she teaches at Georgetown.

05:38.229 --> 05:40.730
When she's not doing that, she's
SSAing at the Washington Field Office,

05:40.798 --> 05:41.848
and she's a Ph.D.

05:41.873 --> 05:43.567
Does that mean I have
to call her doctor? What?!

05:43.568 --> 05:45.868
I did some research on her
'cause I couldn't sleep on the plane.

05:45.936 --> 05:48.723
And my point is, clearly,
she is smart and capable,

05:48.748 --> 05:50.372
but is she nice?

05:50.373 --> 05:51.740
[Clears throat]

05:52.942 --> 05:54.210
Oh, dear God,
this is happening,

05:54.244 --> 05:56.678
where I talk
and the person is behind...

05:56.746 --> 05:58.714
Me.

05:58.781 --> 06:00.082
The origin of "nice"

06:00.150 --> 06:01.984
is 12th century
middle English,

06:02.051 --> 06:03.684
meaning foolish
or stupid.

06:03.752 --> 06:06.154
I hope you're referring
to the modern use of the adjective.

06:08.257 --> 06:09.957
You must be Penelope.

06:10.025 --> 06:11.859
I'm Alex Blake.

06:11.927 --> 06:13.392
Nice to meet you.

06:13.417 --> 06:15.417
Really, actually nice
in the nicest of ways nice.

06:15.964 --> 06:18.433
I'm Derek Morgan.

06:18.501 --> 06:19.633
Welcome back.

06:19.700 --> 06:21.135
How was Seattle?

06:21.202 --> 06:23.803
The unsub made Ridgeway
look like a saint.

06:23.871 --> 06:26.306
He even used his own kid
to bait the victims.

06:26.374 --> 06:29.375
Well, we've seen that before.
No doubt we'll see it again.

06:29.443 --> 06:30.643
Don't unpack.

06:30.710 --> 06:31.744
Garcia, the files.

06:31.811 --> 06:34.480
Yeah. The files. Oh, God.

06:35.616 --> 06:37.150
A few hours ago
there was a prison transfer

06:37.217 --> 06:39.152
to the county hospital
in Abilene, Texas.

06:39.219 --> 06:41.354
The ambulance crashed
and the prisoner escaped.

06:41.421 --> 06:43.388
He's wearing
the EMT uniform,

06:43.456 --> 06:45.723
and he's armed
with the guard's weapon.

06:45.791 --> 06:47.425
Aren't the U.S. Marshals
on this?

06:47.493 --> 06:49.827
Yes, they are,
but they need your help

06:49.895 --> 06:54.166
because this is what
they found inside.

06:54.233 --> 06:57.569
The EMT and the driver
died in the accident.

06:57.637 --> 06:59.570
The guard, however,
suffocated.

07:00.405 --> 07:03.240
Blake:
What's on his mouth?

07:03.308 --> 07:05.342
It was sewn shut.

07:05.410 --> 07:08.111
So the prisoner
is the Silencer.

07:08.146 --> 07:09.680
Or this guy's a copycat.

07:09.747 --> 07:12.449
Forensics confirmed it's the
same unique double-knot ligature

07:12.517 --> 07:13.817
he used
in all 3 murders.

07:13.885 --> 07:15.185
His last known victim
was in 2004

07:15.252 --> 07:16.519
and he was never caught.

07:16.587 --> 07:18.988
So he didn't go dormant
by choice. He was locked up.

07:19.056 --> 07:20.190
Well, why not just escape?

07:20.257 --> 07:21.658
If he hadn't sewn
the guard's mouth shut,

07:21.725 --> 07:23.059
we would never know
it was him.

07:23.126 --> 07:24.927
Rossi: He wants us
to know he's back.

07:24.995 --> 07:27.697
We've got his face.
What's his name?

07:27.764 --> 07:30.300
John Doe. He was pulled over
in '04 for a traffic violation.

07:30.367 --> 07:32.767
No registration, no tags.
He carried no I.D.

07:32.835 --> 07:34.670
No way he did 8 years
for that.

07:34.737 --> 07:36.805
They searched the car
and found a gun with a silencer.

07:36.872 --> 07:39.841
A silencer. He was practically
telling them who he was

07:39.909 --> 07:40.942
and no one
made the connection.

07:41.010 --> 07:42.143
It's a federal offense,

07:42.212 --> 07:43.478
carries a 30-year
minimum sentence.

07:43.546 --> 07:44.979
But it was actually
what he did inside

07:45.047 --> 07:46.648
that guaranteed him
life without parole.

07:46.716 --> 07:48.449
He killed two men
while inside.

07:48.517 --> 07:50.117
And never said a word.

07:50.185 --> 07:52.386
Mm-hmm. He spoke
with his fists.

07:52.454 --> 07:55.323
Remaining silent for 8 years
takes a hell of a lot of self-restraint.

07:55.390 --> 07:56.624
Maybe it was
a conditioned response.

07:56.692 --> 07:58.726
Garcia's gathering
all the files from '04.

07:58.793 --> 08:01.128
We'll catch up on the plane.
Wheels up in 30.

08:09.202 --> 08:11.403
Alex.

08:11.471 --> 08:14.043
I'm sorry I didn't
get a chance to see you

08:14.044 --> 08:14.803
before the Seattle case.

08:14.808 --> 08:16.142
Congratulations.

08:16.209 --> 08:21.447
It took a lot of hard work
to get a shot here.

08:21.515 --> 08:22.848
It wasn't easy.

08:22.915 --> 08:27.119
It's been a long time.

08:30.257 --> 08:33.525
I've got a plane
to catch, Erin.

08:34.794 --> 08:36.727
Good luck.

That was during my
extended sabbatical.

09:34.945 --> 09:37.880
We all consulted, but nobody
made the trip to Texas.

09:39.582 --> 09:42.551
Why not? 3 women
in 4 months.

09:42.619 --> 09:44.987
It's a textbook kill rate.

09:45.054 --> 09:46.588
An undeniable signature.

09:46.623 --> 09:48.957
Obvious surrogates.

09:49.025 --> 09:51.793
We weren't invited
by the local police.

09:51.861 --> 09:54.996
Aren't you tired of that?

09:55.064 --> 09:56.531
Welcome to our world.

09:56.598 --> 09:58.566
The women he killed
were beaten

09:58.600 --> 09:59.834
and left in open ditches.

09:59.902 --> 10:01.702
That physical representation
of his anger is missing

10:01.770 --> 10:03.138
this time around.

10:03.205 --> 10:04.705
He must do something else
that satisfies him.

10:04.773 --> 10:06.307
The signature is the same,

10:06.375 --> 10:07.875
but his victimology
couldn't be more different.

10:07.943 --> 10:10.477
The guard was clearly
a victim of necessity.

10:10.512 --> 10:12.546
But if he's in
need-driven behavior

10:12.613 --> 10:14.548
such as sewing mouths shut,
how can he control that

10:14.615 --> 10:16.050
and only do it to the guard?

10:16.117 --> 10:17.851
Maybe he just ran out of time.

10:17.919 --> 10:19.719
Or he could want the guard
to suffer in silence.

10:19.787 --> 10:21.888
Literally makes
his victims shut up.

10:21.956 --> 10:24.925
It seems obvious, but, uh,
there may be something to that.

10:24.992 --> 10:26.892
Then the question is why?

10:26.960 --> 10:29.128
Morgan, you and JJ
go to the M.E.

10:29.196 --> 10:31.897
Reid, you and Dave
check out John Doe's cell.

10:31.965 --> 10:35.234
Blake and I will
head to the U.S. Marshals.

10:40.640 --> 10:42.574
SSAs Hotchner and Blake.

10:42.641 --> 10:43.741
Bob Tilghman.
Thank you for coming.

10:43.809 --> 10:44.943
I got my whole team
on this.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.578
Any leads yet?

10:46.645 --> 10:48.046
Well, the wreck happened out in
the middle of nowhere after midnight.

10:48.114 --> 10:50.415
The sun comes up at 6:00.
So we figure that he's on foot

10:50.483 --> 10:52.850
somewhere within a 12-mile
radius of the accident site.

10:52.918 --> 10:54.652
You think he's moving
on foot in this heat?

10:54.720 --> 10:56.588
Well, it'll kill you
under the best conditions.

10:56.655 --> 10:59.557
He stole some supplies,
but not enough to hole up too long.

10:59.624 --> 11:01.425
So you can expect him
to be active tonight.

11:01.493 --> 11:02.759
Well, where
can we set up?

11:02.827 --> 11:04.027
Right in here.

11:04.096 --> 11:06.063
Passing any coffee
by chance?

11:06.131 --> 11:08.265
I just started a pot.

11:08.333 --> 11:10.801
We got his picture
plastered everywhere.

11:10.868 --> 11:13.437
But if he's hiding,
he's hiding.

11:13.505 --> 11:16.672
It's gonna be awful hard
to weed him out.

11:16.740 --> 11:18.741
I'm not good at waiting.

11:18.809 --> 11:19.942
Neither am I.

11:20.010 --> 11:21.444
We've been keeping
the media at bay.

11:21.512 --> 11:23.045
We don't want them
to know too much.

11:23.114 --> 11:25.281
You should try
to keep it that way.

11:25.349 --> 11:27.383
What's all this?

11:27.451 --> 11:28.818
His first crimes.

11:28.885 --> 11:31.587
They mean more to us
now that he's killed again.

11:31.655 --> 11:34.189
So he came out just as sick
as he went in.

11:34.257 --> 11:36.058
You think he's gonna move
or wait?

11:36.126 --> 11:37.392
Well, he kills at night,

11:37.460 --> 11:39.762
which means that's when
he's most confident.

11:39.830 --> 11:41.530
If waiting for dark
is the smartest move,

11:41.555 --> 11:43.555
that's what he'll do.

11:44.467 --> 11:46.602
Everything points to
a solitary existence.

11:46.669 --> 11:47.936
You know, interestingly enough,

11:48.004 --> 11:50.304
the most worn book is
"The Count of Monte Cristo."

11:50.372 --> 11:51.405
Of course it is.

11:51.473 --> 11:53.908
The hero's only reason
for living

11:53.976 --> 11:55.944
was to seek vengeance.
Maybe he relates.

11:56.012 --> 11:57.211
It's in French.

11:57.279 --> 12:02.350
I didn't see that coming.
Looks like he wrote a lot too.

12:02.417 --> 12:05.519
He's been pent up physically
and verbally far too long.

12:05.586 --> 12:07.721
So he gets into
his first fight

12:07.756 --> 12:09.657
within days of being here.

12:09.724 --> 12:11.692
It got him a week's worth
of solitary.

12:11.760 --> 12:14.028
That pattern escalated
until he eventually killed an inmate,

12:14.095 --> 12:15.696
got out of solitary
and killed another.

12:15.764 --> 12:19.065
So he silences his victims
before he gets inside.

12:19.133 --> 12:23.302
His actions get him silenced
while he's here.

12:23.370 --> 12:24.303
Ironic?

12:24.371 --> 12:25.538
Fortuitous.

12:25.605 --> 12:27.540
Looks like he has two
forms of expression--

12:27.607 --> 12:29.308
silence and rage.

12:29.376 --> 12:31.144
We need to find out why he's
operating in these extremes.

12:31.178 --> 12:33.012
Maybe it's in
his writings.

12:45.925 --> 12:49.161
The suture is 6-zero
nylon, P-3 needle,

12:49.228 --> 12:51.896
13-millimeter long,
3/8 circle.

12:51.963 --> 12:54.398
A dozen of these
would come in a box.

12:54.465 --> 12:55.900
The suture drawer was empty
on the ambulance.

12:55.967 --> 12:57.735
Then he's got
a lot more.

12:57.803 --> 13:00.404
His technique
isn't like a mortician.

13:00.471 --> 13:02.573
It looks like the stitching
is strictly through the lips.

13:02.640 --> 13:04.008
It's rather crude
what he's done.

13:04.076 --> 13:06.010
You see how the nylon
is stretched?

13:06.078 --> 13:07.578
The victim struggled,

13:07.645 --> 13:10.614
which says the prisoner did it
while this guy was still alive.

13:10.648 --> 13:14.117
Torture.
Just like the first victims.

13:14.151 --> 13:15.777
Well, now that you've
seen his handiwork,

13:15.802 --> 13:17.443
I'll open his mouth.

13:26.296 --> 13:29.264
What do we have here?

13:38.808 --> 13:41.710
"Gazing Through
To The Other Side."

13:41.745 --> 13:43.511
That's not much
of a taunt.

13:43.579 --> 13:45.947
Maybe it's not for us.

13:46.014 --> 13:48.082
Then who?

13:52.087 --> 13:54.688
What do you think?

13:55.690 --> 13:58.860
Can I retract
an earlier statement?

13:58.927 --> 14:01.327
Sure.

14:01.395 --> 14:03.930
There's nothing textbook
about this case.

14:03.998 --> 14:05.747
These victims suffered
in ways that were

14:05.772 --> 14:07.619
painstakingly personal.

14:08.302 --> 14:11.271
You think he was abused
the same way?

14:11.338 --> 14:12.572
Doubt his mouth was sewn.

14:12.673 --> 14:15.142
That's his way
of expressing frustration.

14:15.209 --> 14:18.377
But there's something
tied to the silence.

14:18.444 --> 14:20.445
I'm thinking he stayed
quiet in prison

14:20.513 --> 14:24.016
because he was ridiculed
as a child when he talked.

14:24.084 --> 14:25.951
By someone
who looked like them.

14:26.019 --> 14:27.853
He could have had
a speech impediment.

14:27.921 --> 14:30.289
It would have been severe--
a stutter maybe.

14:30.356 --> 14:31.690
We've got ourself
a reader over here.

14:31.758 --> 14:33.224
In multiple languages.

14:33.259 --> 14:34.625
Spanish, English, and German

14:34.693 --> 14:36.727
are the primary languages
for Texas.

14:36.762 --> 14:39.563
He reads in French, but most
of his own writings are in English.

14:39.631 --> 14:41.032
His handwriting
is the size of courier type,

14:41.100 --> 14:43.001
and so far I've read 50,000 words.
And?

14:43.068 --> 14:44.936
The small print tells me
he's methodical, not always social.

14:45.004 --> 14:48.539
The narrow spacing indicates
a tremendous amount of irritability.

14:48.573 --> 14:51.875
It looks like
stream of consciousness.

14:51.943 --> 14:53.877
Interesting.
His reading comprehension

14:53.945 --> 14:56.246
suggests above-average
intelligence,

14:56.315 --> 14:58.015
but his writing
is inferior.

14:58.082 --> 14:59.917
Could be what
he grew up hearing.

14:59.984 --> 15:01.585
You two should
guest-lecture together.

15:01.653 --> 15:03.287
Oh, wait.

15:03.355 --> 15:05.955
He literally put words
in the guard's mouth.

15:06.023 --> 15:07.156
Rossi: That's new.

15:07.224 --> 15:08.825
Well, we think this
is what we were missing.

15:08.892 --> 15:11.328
The words give him the pleasure
the beatings used to bring.

15:11.395 --> 15:13.129
Reid: Maybe we had this wrong.

15:13.197 --> 15:15.498
What if the ritual
is sewing the mouths shut?

15:15.566 --> 15:16.899
His signature
used to be the beatings,

15:16.967 --> 15:18.568
but now it's putting
words in their mouths.

15:18.583 --> 15:20.784
Just when you think a signature
doesn't get more solid than that.

15:20.904 --> 15:22.038
What did he write?

15:22.105 --> 15:24.540
"Gazing Through
To The Other Side."

15:26.310 --> 15:27.609
It's not an anagram.

15:27.677 --> 15:30.046
Is that a phrase in anything
you've read so far?

15:30.113 --> 15:33.015
No. It's not a well-known
literary reference either.

15:33.083 --> 15:34.283
Well, the words mean
something to him,

15:34.351 --> 15:35.484
otherwise
he wouldn't share it.

15:35.552 --> 15:37.652
It's gonna get dark soon.
He'll be on the move.

15:37.720 --> 15:39.787
You want us on the road
with the Marshals?

15:39.856 --> 15:41.656
No, I think we should
concentrate on remote locations.

15:41.724 --> 15:44.359
He's not just escaping
detection, he's a recluse.

15:44.426 --> 15:46.828
He'll be attracted
to isolated locations.

he could have stolen money,
but the cash register wasn't empty.

qualities of speech

20:44.484 --> 20:45.451

20:45.518 --> 20:47.419
It's proof
that he's able to hear,

20:47.487 --> 20:50.922

he can talk but chooses not to.

20:50.990 --> 20:53.158

what's he use it for?

his only escape.

21:19.116 --> 21:21.084

are not as profound,

21:21.152 --> 21:22.218

comprehension,

21:22.287 --> 21:23.887
we don't believed he's had
an extended education.

Everything
about his psychosis

21:25.657 --> 21:27.923
says the spoken word
has value.

21:27.991 --> 21:29.525
It also greatly angers him.

21:29.593 --> 21:32.227
And if he was yelled at
or made to feel stupid,

21:32.296 --> 21:34.497
he held on to his anger
until he snapped.

21:34.564 --> 21:36.666
Tilghman: So why
hasn't he fled the area?

21:36.733 --> 21:38.301
I mean, he knows there's
a manhunt going on here.

21:38.368 --> 21:40.235
Wouldn't he want to get
as far away as possible?

21:40.304 --> 21:41.671
JJ: Well, he could be
on a mission.

21:41.738 --> 21:44.739
We just don't know if that mission
includes a person or a place.

his target is close to here.

21:50.279 --> 21:52.980
Excuse me. Blake.

21:53.048 --> 21:54.683
Wouldn't you agree
that his messages

21:54.750 --> 21:56.851
are relevant
to the profile?

21:56.919 --> 21:58.186
To a degree, yes.

21:58.253 --> 21:59.520
A degree?

21:59.554 --> 22:01.789
He basically signed
his name to the murders.

22:01.856 --> 22:04.224
He's never left word
before.

22:04.292 --> 22:05.693
That's a significant
change of behavior,

22:05.760 --> 22:07.494
but you completely
dismissed it.

22:07.562 --> 22:09.830
Because the Marshals
have their own agenda

22:09.897 --> 22:12.499
and will believe it's a taunt
no matter what we tell them.

22:12.567 --> 22:15.068
We don't need to give them
any more fuel.

22:15.102 --> 22:18.037
If the unsub needs
to get his thoughts out,

22:18.104 --> 22:20.206
it's like he's reminding us
of something,

22:20.273 --> 22:22.308
and until we know
what that something is,

22:22.376 --> 22:24.377
I'm not comfortable
speculating in front of them.

22:24.445 --> 22:25.845
Well, how about
the rest of us?

22:25.912 --> 22:28.981
Dr. Reid and I
are coming up with theories.

22:29.049 --> 22:31.783
You're welcome to join us.

22:53.238 --> 22:56.807
[Car won't start]

23:05.048 --> 23:07.584
I don't know where
this scar came from.

23:07.651 --> 23:09.552
Well, he got into 23 fights
over 8 years.

23:09.620 --> 23:11.187
It's bound to leave
a few marks.

23:11.255 --> 23:12.622
Yeah, I know, but I read
the records,

23:12.690 --> 23:16.426
and there's no indication
of a scar behind his left ear.

23:16.494 --> 23:18.060
What are you thinking?
Self-inflicted?

23:18.128 --> 23:19.295
It could be.

23:19.363 --> 23:21.764
The left side of his face
is sagging in both photos.

23:21.831 --> 23:23.799
Maybe he had a stroke
or palsy?

23:23.867 --> 23:26.468
So a facial deformity,
a possible speech impediment.

23:26.536 --> 23:27.903
That leads to pretty low
self-esteem.

23:27.970 --> 23:33.008
[Car won't start]

23:33.075 --> 23:34.443
[Car starts]

23:34.511 --> 23:37.077
JJ: How does 8 years locked up
change someone?

23:37.145 --> 23:39.580
Rossi: It takes away
their voice.

23:39.648 --> 23:41.315
But it doesn't take away
his rage.

23:41.383 --> 23:42.983
Time only makes it worse.

23:43.051 --> 23:46.454
What if he started all those fights
so he could be punished?

23:46.522 --> 23:48.656
He was looking for quiet.

23:48.724 --> 23:50.591
So getting into fights
wasn't about his rage.

23:50.659 --> 23:52.325
It was about getting
what he wanted.

23:52.393 --> 23:54.193
Silence.

24:04.405 --> 24:07.040
Daddy will be
right back.

24:13.413 --> 24:19.752
[Baby crying]

24:32.760 --> 24:34.294
Marshal,
where are the parents?

24:34.362 --> 24:36.996
Father's in the stall dead.
No sign of the mother.

24:37.064 --> 24:39.266
He stole the victim's I.D.,
so I have no idea who he is

24:39.333 --> 24:40.933
or what type of vehicle
we're looking for.

24:41.001 --> 24:42.169
Was there
another message?

24:42.236 --> 24:44.671
They're looking right now.

24:44.738 --> 24:46.773
This baby is only
a few months old.

24:46.874 --> 24:48.707
He's too young to hold
the bottle by himself.

24:48.932 --> 24:50.019
Maybe the father
fed him.

24:50.020 --> 24:52.244
You wouldn't take the baby
out of the safety of your car

24:52.269 --> 24:53.546
in the middle of the night.

24:53.547 --> 24:55.080
Then you're telling me
this guy killed a man

24:55.148 --> 24:56.582
then came out here
to care for the baby?

24:56.650 --> 24:57.949
That's exactly what he did.

24:58.017 --> 24:59.518
He stayed with him
while he slept

24:59.586 --> 25:01.187
and then gave him
his pacifier.

25:01.254 --> 25:05.190
Well, then maybe
he's not that far away.

25:05.257 --> 25:08.025
There were no words
left in the mouth this time.

25:08.093 --> 25:10.528
Hotch: I think caring
for the baby is his message.

25:10.596 --> 25:12.163
Then he must relate
to the child.

25:12.231 --> 25:14.699
Maybe he's obsessed
with the nurture he didn't get.

25:14.766 --> 25:16.634
Or simply wanted him
to be quiet.

25:16.702 --> 25:18.236
Hotch: He's telling us
he has boundaries?

25:18.304 --> 25:20.070
No, he's too unstable
for that.

25:20.137 --> 25:25.775
I'd consider him lucky.

25:25.843 --> 25:27.877
Scissors...

25:27.945 --> 25:30.113
suture kits, medical tape.

25:30.181 --> 25:32.115
What's he trying
to tell us?

25:32.183 --> 25:34.117
That he's finished
killing?

25:34.185 --> 25:35.201
He left his tools behind.

25:35.226 --> 25:37.010
That usually means
you're gonna call it quits.

25:37.321 --> 25:38.787
He didn't leave
the stolen gun.

25:38.855 --> 25:40.289
He's not giving up.

26:18.260 --> 26:21.729
Ok, so he leaves words
until today.

26:21.796 --> 26:23.563
Maybe he's closer
to what he's looking for?

26:23.631 --> 26:25.064
He could have already
found it.

26:25.132 --> 26:26.999
If he feels satisfied,
he may disappear.

26:27.067 --> 26:29.535
Mm. We're too close
to let that happen.

26:29.603 --> 26:31.470
All right, then we go back
to the first kills.

26:31.537 --> 26:34.573
3 women, late 40s,
all working class.

26:34.641 --> 26:36.375
Mothers, brunettes,
beaten and left in a ditch.

26:36.442 --> 26:38.077
That was his message.
He hated them.

26:38.145 --> 26:39.645
Maybe he's not targeting
women anymore

26:39.679 --> 26:41.546
because he's already killed
the person he blames.

26:41.614 --> 26:43.048
Blake:
Most likely his mother.

26:43.116 --> 26:45.684
We should have Garcia run
all of the victims' names again.

26:45.752 --> 26:47.451
[Ring]
At your service.

26:47.519 --> 26:49.720
Pull up the '04 victims.

26:49.789 --> 26:51.122
Done.

26:51.190 --> 26:52.891
All right, we need a list
of their children.

26:52.958 --> 26:55.393
Ok, next of kin,
state welfare,

26:55.460 --> 26:56.895
give me a sec.

26:56.962 --> 26:58.196
Gotcha! Ok.

26:58.264 --> 27:01.065
Some were put into foster care
after their moms died,

27:01.133 --> 27:02.766
runaways, truancy, not good.

27:02.834 --> 27:04.501
Any incarcerated?

27:04.568 --> 27:07.004
A handful. Do you have
any more parameters?

27:07.038 --> 27:08.438
Uh, not yet.
Just send us the list.

27:08.506 --> 27:09.572
Comin' at ya now.

27:09.640 --> 27:11.474
All right, let's start
with the first victim.

27:11.542 --> 27:12.843
Julie Myers.

27:12.911 --> 27:15.578
3 boys--
Mark, Greg, and John.

27:15.646 --> 27:17.681
Born '70, '72, '74.

27:17.748 --> 27:20.482
History of truancy.
Child services lost track of them.

27:20.550 --> 27:23.485
Is there any family history
of Cajun French?

27:23.553 --> 27:26.055
Yeah. Julie Myers
was born in New Orleans.

27:26.089 --> 27:28.024
Could explain his interest
in language.

27:28.091 --> 27:30.193
Let's jump ahead to his
most recent behavior.

27:30.260 --> 27:32.094
He leaves all of this behind.

27:32.162 --> 27:33.829
Is it his version of surrender?

27:33.896 --> 27:35.630
What's the medical tape for?

27:35.698 --> 27:37.365
He didn't use it
on any of the victims.

27:37.433 --> 27:40.135
Yet is was important enough
for him to steal from the ambulance.

27:40.203 --> 27:42.637
Maybe he's using it
on himself.

27:42.705 --> 27:44.706
We said that he may have
some kind of nerve damage.

27:44.773 --> 27:47.709
If that's the case,
his eye won't shut by itself.

27:47.776 --> 27:49.110
Maybe he has to tape it down.

27:49.178 --> 27:52.046
It's his left eye, the same side
where the recent scars are.

27:52.113 --> 27:53.247
Under his ear.

27:53.315 --> 27:56.750
What if he was trying
to stop from hearing.

27:56.818 --> 27:59.553
That's pretty severe,
taking a knife to your own head.

27:59.620 --> 28:01.555
He may have had an implant.

28:01.622 --> 28:04.258
The electronic pulses
enhance natural sound.

28:04.326 --> 28:06.459
If all he wants is peace,
an implant is like having

28:06.526 --> 28:07.760
a speaker that goes to 11.

28:07.828 --> 28:09.362
[Beep]

28:09.429 --> 28:10.496
That was fast.

28:10.564 --> 28:13.099
Any of the children
have a cochlear implant?

28:14.935 --> 28:17.036
Uh, 1988, John Myers.

28:17.104 --> 28:18.905
He was 14 at the time.

28:18.973 --> 28:21.507
Yeah, his mom was paid
650 bucks for the medical trial.

28:21.575 --> 28:23.441
Morgan:
Was he deaf before that?

28:23.509 --> 28:25.710
Had to be in order
to participate.

28:25.778 --> 28:28.981
Yikes. It was a highly
experimental procedure.

28:29.048 --> 28:30.991
It was tested on humans
and not animals.

28:31.016 --> 28:32.550
Caused quite the controversy.

28:32.551 --> 28:34.086
So mom gives him
the gift of hearing

28:34.153 --> 28:35.520
and it turns out
to be a curse.

28:35.554 --> 28:37.789
Spent his first 14 years
in silence,

28:37.857 --> 28:39.190
gets lost
in the world through books,

28:39.258 --> 28:40.892
learns languages--
anything to escape.

28:40.959 --> 28:43.110
He's content, and then
his mom gets paid

28:43.135 --> 28:44.829
to use him as a guinea pig.

28:44.830 --> 28:47.298
And now he can't
turn the noise off.

28:47.366 --> 28:51.403
JJ: He blamed her
and wanted her to suffer.

28:53.773 --> 28:58.174
[Roaring sound]

28:58.242 --> 29:00.844
[High-pitched squeal]

29:01.880 --> 29:04.415
I told you
to clean your room.

29:04.482 --> 29:06.016
You're an idiot.

29:06.083 --> 29:07.684
You...

29:07.752 --> 29:10.686
[Speaking Cajun French]

29:10.754 --> 29:12.054
I told you not
to look at me!

29:12.122 --> 29:13.856
Don't look at me!

29:14.892 --> 29:18.728
Hey! Hey. I told you
to do the dishes.

29:18.762 --> 29:20.996
Oh, you deaf and dumb
son of a bitch.

29:21.064 --> 29:22.364
Hey!

29:22.433 --> 29:24.467
Hey, you deaf dumb
son of a bitch!

29:24.535 --> 29:26.235
Look at me.

29:26.303 --> 29:27.602
Talk to me!

29:27.670 --> 29:30.605
Use your mouth!

29:41.818 --> 29:44.284
These messages don't have
a sense of geography,

29:44.352 --> 29:47.354
so he isn't leaving us
a road map to his happy place.

29:47.422 --> 29:48.789
They rarely do.

29:48.857 --> 29:52.092
I don't think the writing
is his own.

29:52.160 --> 29:54.361
You said it wasn't written
in any literature.

29:54.429 --> 29:56.296
The phrasing is unnatural
to the written word.

29:56.364 --> 29:58.698
It's like an oral
recollection.

29:58.766 --> 30:02.902
Like a campfire story
about paradise.

30:02.970 --> 30:05.472
One that he's searching for.

30:05.539 --> 30:08.274
And if he can't find it,
he'll kill again.

30:15.748 --> 30:18.750
[Indistinct chatter,
loud engines]

30:18.818 --> 30:20.586
[High-pitched squeal]

30:22.121 --> 30:25.290
[Sounds become louder]

30:30.796 --> 30:34.298
[Sounds continue louder,
high-pitched squeal]

30:50.830 --> 30:52.998
If these aren't his words,
whose are they?

30:53.066 --> 30:55.334
We need to find out
who his neighbors were in prison.

30:55.402 --> 30:59.104
He spent more time in solitary
than he did in his own cell.

30:59.173 --> 31:00.973
It's total darkness
but not complete silence.

31:01.041 --> 31:02.740
The inmates can speak
through the walls.

31:02.808 --> 31:06.311
Let's see which fellow
inmates did time in solitary

31:06.379 --> 31:07.512
when he was there.

31:07.580 --> 31:09.747
I can't imagine that
someone thrown in solitary

31:09.782 --> 31:11.816
is nice enough to tell
campfire stories.

31:11.884 --> 31:13.818
Some inmates get put there
for their own protection.

31:13.886 --> 31:15.720
That's true. We should start
with those prisoners.

31:15.788 --> 31:18.656
Hold on. See how he wrote
"waiting on the taste of honey."

31:18.723 --> 31:20.324
It's got southern
U.S. roots,

31:20.392 --> 31:22.660
but more specifically,
it's Texas south,

31:22.727 --> 31:25.329
a sub-dialect
of southern English

31:25.363 --> 31:27.264
found in the north-central
part of the state.

31:27.332 --> 31:30.033
Right here--you wait
for something that hasn't shown up,

31:30.101 --> 31:32.903
you wait <i>on</i> something
that's nearby.

31:32.970 --> 31:34.371
Then the taste of honey
would be close.

31:34.439 --> 31:36.840
Yes, and the storyteller
is probably from north of here.

31:36.941 --> 31:39.009
Fewer were thrown
in the hole than you think.

31:39.077 --> 31:40.276
Go ahead, Garcia.

31:40.344 --> 31:42.212
Our unsub was the MVP
of solitary.

31:42.279 --> 31:43.693
He was in there more than
any other prisoner.

31:43.721 --> 31:45.713
Hotch: All right, we're looking for
somebody who didn't belong in jail.

31:45.714 --> 31:47.147
His offense would be minimal.

31:47.172 --> 31:49.172
He might even be there
for his own protection.

31:49.553 --> 31:51.020
Uh-huh. I got a few.

31:51.088 --> 31:52.822
Can you read off
the hometowns?

31:52.889 --> 31:54.256
Sure. Beaumont,

31:54.324 --> 31:55.624
Edinburgh, Sweetwater--

31:55.692 --> 31:57.359
Sweetwater.
Who was that inmate?

31:57.427 --> 32:00.329
Danny Tucker. Looks like
he was only in for 2 months.

32:00.396 --> 32:02.131
Well, it's long enough
to tell stories to John Myers.

32:02.199 --> 32:04.130
Hey, his family owns property
near where you are.

32:04.155 --> 32:06.068
It's really secluded, too.

32:06.069 --> 32:07.802
With local honey,
by any chance?

32:07.870 --> 32:09.503
They are known for it.

32:09.571 --> 32:11.172
That's where he's headed.

32:11.240 --> 32:13.041
Garcia,
is it a private property?

32:13.109 --> 32:15.744
It was, but it's been sold.
They're building a housing development.

32:15.811 --> 32:17.979
So it's not the hideaway
he hopes it's going to be.

32:18.047 --> 32:19.080
Where would he go?

32:19.148 --> 32:21.082
He might blame Danny
for lying to him. Garcia.

32:21.150 --> 32:23.317
Danny's house is down the road
from the development.

32:23.385 --> 32:25.553
I'm sending his address
to your phones now.

32:25.621 --> 32:27.321
All right, Dave,
you and Reid go to the site.

32:27.356 --> 32:29.223
The rest of us will go
to Danny's house.

32:46.406 --> 32:48.207
Hey, I'm home.

32:55.983 --> 32:58.350
Where's everybody?

33:03.656 --> 33:05.423
Laura?

33:05.491 --> 33:07.793
What the hell?

33:07.860 --> 33:09.194
Danny...

33:11.197 --> 33:12.864
Ok. Ok.

33:12.932 --> 33:15.100
We don't have any money.

33:15.168 --> 33:17.402
But, uh...you can
take my truck.

33:17.469 --> 33:19.069
Here's the keys.

33:19.137 --> 33:21.673
Go ahead, now. Go on.

33:22.808 --> 33:25.009
I'm not gonna tell
anybody about this.

33:26.812 --> 33:28.012
Just go on.

33:28.079 --> 33:30.448
Danny, watch out!
Danny!

33:30.516 --> 33:32.750
Oh, God.
What are you doing?

33:32.818 --> 33:35.919
Somebody help us.

33:35.986 --> 33:38.355
[Sirens]

33:38.423 --> 33:40.089
You're on speaker,
Garcia.

33:40.157 --> 33:42.125
Hey, I was doing some digging
'cause that's what I do

33:42.193 --> 33:43.593
and I found something weird.

33:43.661 --> 33:45.895
Danny Tucker was only ever
in solitary.

33:45.963 --> 33:47.831
So they never saw
one another.

33:47.898 --> 33:49.232
I can't tell you that
for sure, but...

33:49.300 --> 33:51.600
Well, we know Danny
wasn't made for jail time.

33:51.668 --> 33:53.803
He probably talked
just to keep his sanity.

33:53.870 --> 33:57.406
Sold the story of paradise
to some guy stuck in darkness.

33:57.474 --> 33:59.342
Gave him all that time
to fantasize about the place,

33:59.409 --> 34:00.776
he finally gets free
and he's convinced

34:00.811 --> 34:02.745
that finding it
will solve everything.

34:02.813 --> 34:04.079
Danny!

34:04.147 --> 34:06.881
Oh, God, don't hurt him.
Please don't hurt him.

34:06.949 --> 34:09.150
Please, please,
please don't hurt him.

34:09.217 --> 34:10.918
Please don't hurt him!
[Sobbing]

34:10.985 --> 34:12.620
[Grunts]
Aah!

34:12.688 --> 34:15.289
No. No!

34:15.358 --> 34:16.991
Please don't hurt him!

34:17.059 --> 34:18.059
[Grunting]

34:18.126 --> 34:19.427
Stop!

34:19.495 --> 34:22.463
Danny! Danny!

34:22.530 --> 34:24.665
Danny...Danny?

34:24.733 --> 34:27.100
Danny...

34:30.472 --> 34:31.705
Danny!

34:31.773 --> 34:35.442
Danny!
Please, don't hurt him--

34:35.510 --> 34:38.177
John Myers, FBI.
Show me your hands.

34:38.245 --> 34:40.380
Yeah.
Are you ok?

34:42.248 --> 34:43.850
Put down the gun.

34:43.917 --> 34:46.719
John, you heard him.

34:46.786 --> 34:48.788
Put it down.

34:48.856 --> 34:51.724
Go on, now. It's ok.

34:54.793 --> 34:58.563
See? I'll do it.

35:04.437 --> 35:06.304
Ok?

35:06.372 --> 35:08.106
It's your turn.

35:10.308 --> 35:14.278
Slowly, please.

35:15.947 --> 35:17.715
"He's a liar.

35:17.783 --> 35:22.152
There's no peace."

35:22.220 --> 35:24.388
Who's a liar?

35:24.456 --> 35:27.256
Danny?

35:29.860 --> 35:32.462
"There's nowhere to go."

35:33.497 --> 35:35.532
"I'm not...

35:35.599 --> 35:37.801
going back in there."

35:41.438 --> 35:44.339
There's no other way.

36:01.356 --> 36:03.357
[Gunshot]

36:06.662 --> 36:09.430
I doubt anyone had ever spoken
to him with any kindness.

36:09.531 --> 36:12.700
None of us
should be denied that.

36:15.503 --> 36:18.872
Hotch: "A man is known
by the silence he keeps."

36:18.940 --> 36:21.107
Oliver Herford.

36:31.585 --> 36:33.586
Don't tell me
there's another one.

36:33.653 --> 36:36.254
There's always another one.

36:36.322 --> 36:38.524
I told you we should have
just gotten into our cars.

36:38.592 --> 36:39.692
Where are we off to now?

36:39.759 --> 36:40.726
Home.

36:40.760 --> 36:42.394
You need to spend
at least one night

36:42.462 --> 36:43.696
in your own beds.

36:43.763 --> 36:45.130
You don't have to
tell me twice.

36:45.198 --> 36:47.198
Thanks.
Uh, yeah. Wait for me.

36:57.109 --> 36:59.343
Agent Blake.

37:00.245 --> 37:04.280
I owe you an explanation.

37:04.348 --> 37:06.016
I know that you may not
believe this,

37:06.083 --> 37:10.153
but the part of my job
that I dislike the most is politics.

37:10.221 --> 37:13.056
When you were blamed
for arresting the wrong suspect

37:13.124 --> 37:16.359
in the Marathox case,
I didn't stand up for you.

37:16.427 --> 37:18.327
I let you take the fall.

37:18.395 --> 37:20.162
No. No.

37:20.196 --> 37:22.532
You cut my rope.

37:22.599 --> 37:25.935
It was the highest-profile case
we'd seen that year.

37:26.003 --> 37:28.337
All eyes were on me.

37:28.405 --> 37:30.040
It took a decade to recover.

37:30.041 --> 37:31.875
But I can assure you
that your reputation in

37:31.900 --> 37:33.991
the Bureau remained intact.

37:34.610 --> 37:36.144
It sounds like
you've convinced yourself

37:36.211 --> 37:39.014
that you didn't do any damage,
but you did, Erin.

37:39.081 --> 37:43.018
Well, that was never...
my intent.

37:43.085 --> 37:44.553
I'm sorry.

37:44.620 --> 37:47.455
And my hope is that
we can get past it.

37:47.523 --> 37:50.724
Maybe it doesn't matter to you,
but I am glad that you're here.

37:50.792 --> 37:54.361
Well, that makes two of us.

37:54.429 --> 37:56.997
Good night.

37:57.065 --> 37:59.199
You should go home
and get some rest.

37:59.267 --> 38:01.101
Don't tell me
you're staying here.

38:01.169 --> 38:02.870
Oh, just long enough
to do the reports.

38:02.938 --> 38:05.005
Ok, good.
Good night.

38:05.073 --> 38:07.607
And you?

38:07.675 --> 38:09.842
You and Strauss
got a little history?

38:11.178 --> 38:12.679
Uh...

38:12.746 --> 38:14.380
in another life.

38:14.448 --> 38:16.415
There's a story in there.

38:16.483 --> 38:18.051
You heading out?
Hmm.

38:18.118 --> 38:19.385
In a bit.

38:19.453 --> 38:21.054
All right.
See you tomorrow.

38:21.121 --> 38:22.854
Yep.

38:25.091 --> 38:27.893
[Sighs]

38:35.501 --> 38:37.335
Hi.

38:38.937 --> 38:41.239
Hello.

38:41.307 --> 38:43.007
Welcome back.

38:43.075 --> 38:44.008
You're here late.

38:44.076 --> 38:46.944
Yeah,
I haven't really slept.

38:47.012 --> 38:50.348
Well, join the club.

38:51.617 --> 38:53.784
Can we start over?

38:57.188 --> 38:58.688
Sure.

38:58.756 --> 39:00.991
Hi. My name is Penelope,

39:01.058 --> 39:03.393
and I do not like change.

39:03.461 --> 39:05.895
Well, you're not alone.

39:05.963 --> 39:09.533
Well, I think it's worse
for me than the others.

39:09.601 --> 39:10.666
Ok.

39:10.734 --> 39:12.401
I've always been like that.
It goes back--

39:12.469 --> 39:13.902
this is not
a therapy session.

39:13.970 --> 39:15.404
I really wanted to explain--

39:15.472 --> 39:17.006
It's--it's fine.

39:17.107 --> 39:18.974
Honestly.

39:20.910 --> 39:23.078
I heard you live
in the district.

39:23.147 --> 39:25.581
That can't be
an easy commute.

39:28.784 --> 39:31.119
That's really nice.

39:31.187 --> 39:33.555
Nice, huh?

39:36.091 --> 39:37.959
Thoughtful.

39:38.027 --> 39:40.695
I don't even know
if you drink coffee...

39:40.763 --> 39:44.365
Oh, do I drink coffee and...

39:44.432 --> 39:46.600
and anything else
that keeps me going.

39:46.668 --> 39:48.302
We have new teas
coming in next week.

39:48.336 --> 39:49.270
Proper tea?

39:49.337 --> 39:50.538
As proper as it gets.

39:50.605 --> 39:51.572
Can you get my brand?

39:51.640 --> 39:52.973
I don't know.
I don't have a brand.

39:53.041 --> 39:55.576
There's a--I could
get you your brand.
