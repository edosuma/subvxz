00:06.120 --> 00:08.520
PREVIOUSLY ON MYTHO

00:09.680 --> 00:12.920
"I'd like us to spend
Christmas together. Elvira."

00:13.000 --> 00:15.920
I didn't intend
to have dinner with Elvira.

00:16.000 --> 00:18.880
I said yes, but don't ask me
to welcome her with open arms.

00:18.960 --> 00:21.200
-Cancel it.
-Cancel Christmas?

00:21.280 --> 00:22.280
Mom?

00:25.000 --> 00:26.200
Why did you abandon me?

00:26.720 --> 00:28.720
I was too young to take care of you.

00:28.800 --> 00:31.400
My grandma found you a family in Italy.

00:32.480 --> 00:33.640
Get lost!

00:34.520 --> 00:35.800
Are we real cousins?

00:35.880 --> 00:36.920
Or sorta cousins?

00:37.000 --> 00:39.000
We're all cousins in the village.

00:39.080 --> 00:41.000
You're not in love with him, are you?

00:41.080 --> 00:42.480
Leave me alone.

00:42.560 --> 00:43.880
Does she know we have sex?

00:43.960 --> 00:45.160
We had sex once.

00:45.240 --> 00:47.520
It looks like he's jealous.

00:48.040 --> 00:49.640
SAM AND RENAN IN LOVE!?!

00:50.640 --> 00:52.040
You know why we're here?

00:53.320 --> 00:55.640
You're happy you're going to see "him".

00:56.600 --> 00:57.520
I love you, Elvira.

00:57.600 --> 00:59.760
I have loved you. Forever.

01:01.360 --> 01:03.320
Maxence, come back!

01:07.040 --> 01:09.480
A NETFLIX ORIGINAL SERIES

01:10.040 --> 01:14.040
ME-RY CHRISTMAS

01:19.880 --> 01:21.640
I think this is it.

01:21.720 --> 01:23.640
What do you mean "you think"?
Are you sure?

01:23.720 --> 01:24.760
Well...

01:26.760 --> 01:27.600
Elvira?

01:28.640 --> 01:29.480
Elvira, it's--

01:29.560 --> 01:30.560
Channa!

01:30.640 --> 01:31.480
I'm here.

01:32.520 --> 01:33.760
Shit, Channa.

01:37.040 --> 01:38.400
-Elvira?
-Yes.

01:38.480 --> 01:40.680
Told you he was a psychopath.

01:40.760 --> 01:42.520
-Go ahead.
-Yeah, all right.

01:42.600 --> 01:44.480
So glad to wreck that jerk's door.

01:44.560 --> 01:45.520
-Okay.
-Come on,

01:45.600 --> 01:47.760
hurry up or we'll miss the game.

01:49.400 --> 01:50.600
Careful, honey.

01:51.960 --> 01:53.040
Just a question.

01:53.120 --> 01:53.960
What?

01:54.040 --> 01:55.680
Did you call a locksmith?

01:55.760 --> 01:58.520
Yes, I tried four of them, they were busy.

01:58.600 --> 02:00.160
Family Christmas dinners.

02:00.240 --> 02:03.600
-Okay.
-And the police?

02:03.680 --> 02:06.640
They sent me packing,
said they weren't locksmiths.

02:06.720 --> 02:09.080
-Okay.
-We're in a hurry. Here, hold her.

02:09.600 --> 02:10.760
-Easy, her head.
-Channa?

02:11.680 --> 02:12.520
Are you there?

02:15.280 --> 02:17.400
Hey! What's wrong with you!

02:17.480 --> 02:20.120
-You saw the picture?
-Hold on a second.

02:20.200 --> 02:22.360
I suggest we all calm down.

02:22.840 --> 02:25.720
Sam, show me the picture you posted.

02:33.440 --> 02:34.640
Breach of privacy.

02:35.320 --> 02:36.920
A right of image violation.

02:37.000 --> 02:38.240
He could be fined.

02:38.320 --> 02:40.120
Yeah, are you a lawyer?

02:40.200 --> 02:42.080
No, I manage Hardware City.

02:42.160 --> 02:47.520
Right, that's why you look familiar.
I enjoy going there

02:47.600 --> 02:49.760
to hang out, look around.
I like the tool thing.

02:49.840 --> 02:50.760
I'm the lawyer.

02:53.520 --> 02:55.640
Listen, it's Christmas Eve.

02:56.200 --> 02:59.520
This evening will be challenging.
I'll spare you the details.

02:59.600 --> 03:04.000
Let's handle this quickly, because
we all have some bad foie gras to toast.

03:04.080 --> 03:06.800
The posting of the picture caused
Renan great harm.

03:06.880 --> 03:08.880
He's very distressed.

03:08.960 --> 03:10.840
His exams are in five months.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.240
It won't fly, I'm warning you.

03:15.000 --> 03:15.880
Shit.

03:15.960 --> 03:17.360
What's happening?

03:17.440 --> 03:18.760
I can't pull it out.

03:19.400 --> 03:21.200
-Try again.
-Impossible. Look.

03:21.280 --> 03:22.960
What are we going to do?

03:23.040 --> 03:24.320
I don't know.

03:24.400 --> 03:25.320
Hold on.

03:34.280 --> 03:36.760
What is this?
Did you call all the local locksmiths?

03:36.840 --> 03:38.640
It's Christmas Eve!

03:41.200 --> 03:42.360
-Evening.
-Evening.

03:43.160 --> 03:44.000
-Hi!
-Good evening.

03:44.080 --> 03:45.640
Good evening.

03:47.440 --> 03:48.840
Merry Christmas to you.

03:50.920 --> 03:53.120
They don't celebrate it, like us.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.200
Good night.

03:56.840 --> 03:58.120
-That's it.
-What?

03:58.200 --> 03:59.800
-Give me your phone.
-What?

03:59.880 --> 04:02.400
-Give me your phone.
-Why?

04:07.280 --> 04:08.920
I owned a horse growing up.

04:09.880 --> 04:12.360
The only human being
I ever loved on earth.

04:13.680 --> 04:14.960
His name was Stewball.

04:18.560 --> 04:19.800
He had long lashes.

04:20.920 --> 04:21.760
Like her.

04:23.000 --> 04:25.440
She has long lashes like Stewball.

04:27.160 --> 04:28.560
Her hair, too.

04:30.040 --> 04:33.200
That's why I'm crazy about her, you see?

04:38.880 --> 04:40.400
I love her.

04:41.440 --> 04:42.760
I want her babies.

04:45.280 --> 04:47.520
That's crazy, I hate children.

04:49.440 --> 04:51.360
No, I want to shop for her.

04:52.600 --> 04:53.440
Every day.

04:55.200 --> 04:56.440
And cook for her.

04:57.800 --> 04:59.040
Even for her kids.

04:59.120 --> 04:59.960
Sir?

05:04.160 --> 05:05.880
Another, please.

05:11.160 --> 05:14.000
<i>This is Nonno's phone. I'm not here--</i>

05:14.080 --> 05:14.920
No answer.

05:16.080 --> 05:17.400
Maybe something happened.

05:18.200 --> 05:19.800
Or he met with Karina.

05:22.120 --> 05:23.560
Call him.

05:23.640 --> 05:24.920
You're Nonno's favorite.

05:25.000 --> 05:27.440
Isn't slander a serious offense to you?

05:27.520 --> 05:29.960
"Slander"? You're overreacting.

05:30.040 --> 05:32.400
Our son received tons of hate messages.

05:32.480 --> 05:35.360
Sam isn't responsible
for the psychos going after

05:35.440 --> 05:36.840
-your son.
-Howdy!

05:36.920 --> 05:37.760
Without his post,

05:37.840 --> 05:39.360
-it wouldn't have happened.
-Okay.

05:39.440 --> 05:40.440
It's his fault.

05:40.520 --> 05:42.040
Hello, Carole.

05:42.120 --> 05:44.000
Hello. Dad?

05:44.480 --> 05:45.360
Excuse me.

05:46.320 --> 05:47.400
I'm going for a walk.

05:48.720 --> 05:49.760
Hi, Patrick.

05:50.320 --> 05:51.160
Hi.

05:51.240 --> 05:54.920
I also got some Sauternes, foie gras,
and a turkey.

05:56.040 --> 05:57.560
...the mother's number.

05:57.640 --> 05:59.840
But...

05:59.920 --> 06:02.880
You suggested we should spend
Christmas together.

06:04.680 --> 06:06.200
After we...

06:06.280 --> 06:11.840
Wow! Oh, my God. Sandrine, I'm sorry.

06:12.440 --> 06:14.280
I probably wasn't myself.

06:15.080 --> 06:20.280
And it's a very bad idea.
Elvira will be here any minute now.

06:21.360 --> 06:25.040
Are you not spending
Christmas Eve with your family?

06:25.120 --> 06:27.640
My parents died on December 23rd
when I was five.

06:29.960 --> 06:32.880
Sorry. I forgot.

06:34.600 --> 06:36.040
And you bought oysters.

06:36.600 --> 06:37.600
Well, yeah.

06:37.680 --> 06:38.800
I love oysters.

06:39.840 --> 06:40.880
I know.

06:42.240 --> 06:43.480
Come in then.

06:45.080 --> 06:46.320
You could listen to me.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.040
Wait until we're home.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.080
No... There are people.

06:50.840 --> 06:52.520
You're glad I'm here?

06:52.600 --> 06:56.160
Yeah, yeah.
And we needed festive things to eat.

06:56.240 --> 06:57.400
I got gifts, too.

06:58.160 --> 06:59.680
I'll go in the kitchen.

07:00.760 --> 07:01.800
Hello!

07:01.880 --> 07:02.760
Hello, Sandrine.

07:02.840 --> 07:03.680
How are you?

07:07.080 --> 07:08.720
Why aren't we celebrating this year?

07:08.800 --> 07:10.520
Because Christmas is impure.

07:11.680 --> 07:12.720
Don't be a brat.

07:13.720 --> 07:15.600
Shall we? Clémence!

07:23.040 --> 07:24.400
What are you doing?

07:24.480 --> 07:26.960
Aren't we allowed a glass of champagne?

07:29.160 --> 07:30.720
What about turkey? Is it allowed?

07:30.800 --> 07:31.920
Are chestnuts impure?

07:32.680 --> 07:34.160
It's fucking Christmas.

07:35.520 --> 07:37.120
Hurry, we're waiting.

07:37.200 --> 07:38.360
I can't anymore.

07:39.080 --> 07:43.600
Your pills, your purification exercises,
your precepts. Fuck them, okay?

07:44.000 --> 07:45.200
I want to be impure!

07:49.560 --> 07:51.040
Fuck Life's Awakening!

07:52.120 --> 07:54.000
Life's Awakening, my ass!

07:54.800 --> 07:55.920
Come on, let's go.

07:59.600 --> 08:01.200
A glass to get in the mood.

08:02.080 --> 08:03.240
-No, thanks.
-No, thanks.

08:03.320 --> 08:04.760
It's so nice

08:04.840 --> 08:06.640
to spend Christmas together.

08:07.960 --> 08:10.440
And your son is so cute, I love him.

08:10.520 --> 08:12.040
I left the foie gras in the car.

08:13.040 --> 08:13.880
I'll get it.

08:14.360 --> 08:15.200
Well...

08:16.080 --> 08:19.160
Here's what we're going to do
for the sake of the Christmas spirit.

08:19.800 --> 08:25.840
Sam, you're going to post an apology
on your account saying that you posted

08:25.920 --> 08:29.920
the picture without Renan's consent,
and that you're sorry.

08:30.720 --> 08:31.600
That it's not true.

08:31.680 --> 08:33.040
And that it's not true.

08:33.560 --> 08:36.080
And that... What's not true?

08:36.160 --> 08:40.840
Samuel will write that our son and he
are not in a gay relationship.

08:42.360 --> 08:47.200
Hold on, I beg to differ. The picture
doesn't show them sticking stickers.

08:47.280 --> 08:48.280
It's a fake.

08:48.840 --> 08:51.320
No, well, it doesn't seem that...

08:51.400 --> 08:52.880
He tricked him.

08:52.960 --> 08:54.760
You are kidding!

08:54.840 --> 08:56.200
What about his German pen pal?

08:56.280 --> 08:57.520
We all know that story.

08:57.600 --> 09:00.280
What? Those are
two completely different things!

09:00.360 --> 09:03.440
Niklas thought Sam was a girl.

09:03.520 --> 09:07.160
Renan, you knew you were French kissing
a guy, right?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.880
Don't talk to my son like that.

09:08.960 --> 09:10.400
Listen, I get it.

09:10.480 --> 09:13.000
You must be very...

09:13.080 --> 09:16.920
open-minded normally,
but when it's our kids, it's harder.

09:17.000 --> 09:18.640
You'll get used to it.

09:18.720 --> 09:21.200
Don't mind me,
I'll get the toasts started.

09:22.600 --> 09:24.400
All right, let's go.

09:24.480 --> 09:25.520
Come on...

09:25.600 --> 09:28.200
You're wasting a lot of time,
it's a shame.

09:28.280 --> 09:30.200
-Keep your advice.
-Come on, honey.

09:39.200 --> 09:41.360
Don't resist.

09:44.080 --> 09:45.440
Right.

09:45.520 --> 09:46.440
You're okay there?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.280
Almost there.

09:49.360 --> 09:51.080
-Just a little more.
-What is it?

09:53.560 --> 09:54.520
Here you go.

09:58.880 --> 09:59.840
Thank you.

10:01.280 --> 10:02.200
You okay, Elvira?

10:04.760 --> 10:08.600
So glad to see you.
Sorry, but we have to go.

10:08.680 --> 10:11.600
A charity tournament for kids
who don't celebrate Christmas.

10:11.680 --> 10:12.520
Right.

10:12.600 --> 10:15.280
I'm all in. It's called
"Don't give a damn about Christmas."

10:16.240 --> 10:17.240
Good night.

10:17.320 --> 10:18.160
Thank you.

10:20.000 --> 10:22.440
-Channa, get a move on?
-Coming.

10:22.520 --> 10:25.120
I hope you'll be fine, honey.

10:25.600 --> 10:27.280
Thank you.

10:31.680 --> 10:32.600
You'll be okay?

10:33.840 --> 10:35.280
Can you drop me off?

10:35.880 --> 10:38.720
Yeah, of course. I have nothing tonight.

10:39.800 --> 10:40.640
Good evening.

10:41.760 --> 10:43.800
Good evening. I'm Lydie.

10:44.760 --> 10:46.320
This is my daughter Sonia.

10:47.720 --> 10:48.560
Come in.

10:52.400 --> 10:53.480
Good evening.

10:54.080 --> 10:55.280
Clémence couldn't make it.

10:56.440 --> 10:57.320
Timothée, my son.

11:01.200 --> 11:04.520
My goal is to find
the connection between...

11:04.600 --> 11:06.280
That's nice.

11:06.360 --> 11:08.000
I heard, Lydie, Sonia.

11:08.080 --> 11:09.400
That's right.

11:10.120 --> 11:11.200
-Sonia.
-Sonia.

11:12.720 --> 11:13.720
And you are?

11:16.320 --> 11:17.160
Good evening.

11:23.480 --> 11:24.600
What are you doing here?

11:25.440 --> 11:26.440
What about you?

11:26.520 --> 11:27.880
I'm with my mother.

11:27.960 --> 11:30.280
Someone gave her a flyer at the market.

11:31.280 --> 11:33.520
I came along, I was afraid it was a cult.

11:33.600 --> 11:35.040
Stop right there.

11:35.120 --> 11:36.680
You can't say that here.

11:44.120 --> 11:48.000
Welcome to those who decided
to better the world

11:49.360 --> 11:50.960
by bettering themselves.

11:55.600 --> 11:56.880
Come on, open.

11:58.960 --> 12:00.000
They're alive?

12:00.080 --> 12:02.160
Yeah. Look, it's moving.

12:02.240 --> 12:04.240
Yikes, stop that, it's gross.

12:05.320 --> 12:07.600
One day you'll find them delicious.

12:08.160 --> 12:10.400
Mrs. Ménard believes in reincarnation.

12:11.120 --> 12:13.760
You shouldn't eat animals,
because they are our ancestors.

12:14.440 --> 12:16.840
Gran, if this is you, Merry Christmas.

12:21.040 --> 12:22.800
Everything okay?

12:22.880 --> 12:23.720
Yeah.

12:24.200 --> 12:25.240
I'm almost done.

12:30.440 --> 12:32.400
I can't get over seeing my mom here.

12:32.480 --> 12:33.320
And you, too.

12:34.240 --> 12:35.320
It helps me.

12:36.040 --> 12:38.040
It's a healing process.

12:39.000 --> 12:41.320
I just take the good stuff.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.800
But I don't take the vitamins.

12:44.520 --> 12:46.280
Something awoke in us.

12:46.360 --> 12:48.640
Our intimacy especially.

12:49.360 --> 12:51.560
Wonderful. That's wonderful.

12:51.640 --> 12:54.960
We're embarking
on the Life's Awakening ship in January.

12:55.040 --> 12:57.120
A 16-month cruise.

12:57.200 --> 12:58.680
It'll be wonderful.

12:58.760 --> 13:00.800
-Months or days?
-Sixteen months.

13:00.880 --> 13:02.600
Your friends are so creepy.

13:02.680 --> 13:03.640
How much?

13:03.720 --> 13:04.920
Fifty thousand each.

13:05.000 --> 13:06.560
They're not all like that.

13:06.640 --> 13:08.480
You can pay in installments.

13:08.560 --> 13:09.920
And who are these two?

13:10.840 --> 13:12.040
Newcomers.

13:12.840 --> 13:16.920
Ms. Ménard doesn't trust them.
She thinks they're investigating cults.

13:17.000 --> 13:17.840
Really?

13:19.560 --> 13:20.640
Then again...

13:24.880 --> 13:27.920
Carole, you seem very cheerful tonight.

13:31.800 --> 13:32.640
Sorry.

13:34.400 --> 13:36.200
We were about to leave.

13:36.280 --> 13:37.400
As you wish.

13:39.240 --> 13:41.440
Be careful not to stunt your process.

13:44.040 --> 13:44.880
We're leaving.

13:53.760 --> 13:55.320
Is Lorenzo coming tonight?

13:56.240 --> 13:57.360
I don't know.

13:58.120 --> 13:59.520
Did you invite him?

13:59.600 --> 14:00.840
Yeah.

14:03.800 --> 14:05.880
-Where are you going?
-I have something to do.

14:08.800 --> 14:09.880
What's his deal?

14:10.680 --> 14:11.520
I don't know.

14:21.320 --> 14:22.200
Oh my...

14:22.280 --> 14:23.800
We're waiting for everyone.

14:24.880 --> 14:27.520
I need to eat something,
I don't feel good.

14:27.600 --> 14:28.640
Are you okay?

14:35.080 --> 14:36.160
It's Nonno.

14:38.480 --> 14:39.320
Hello?

14:40.800 --> 14:42.200
Where are you?

14:42.760 --> 14:45.080
Did you see Sandrine's gifts?

14:46.240 --> 14:47.360
She brought gifts?

14:48.000 --> 14:49.440
Yeah, a ton.

14:49.960 --> 14:52.120
That fool is so bribing you.

14:52.200 --> 14:53.480
It's awesome.

14:53.560 --> 14:57.040
Where does all her money come from?
Her clothes, her car, all that.

14:57.120 --> 15:00.120
She doesn't need to work
because of a big inheritance.

15:00.200 --> 15:02.920
Her family died in a plane crash
when she was a kid.

15:03.000 --> 15:04.440
-Nonsense.
-Yeah.

15:04.520 --> 15:06.520
Yes. It's true.

15:08.280 --> 15:10.800
I just spoke to Nonno on the phone,
he's not coming.

15:10.880 --> 15:11.720
Why not?

15:11.800 --> 15:16.280
He was going to join Karina
at her mother's...

15:16.840 --> 15:17.680
See?

15:17.760 --> 15:21.760
He figured he couldn't leave you alone
for Christmas Eve so he turned around.

15:21.840 --> 15:23.600
Thanks to me, I convinced him.

15:23.680 --> 15:26.320
But he ended up getting stuck
because of the snow.

15:26.400 --> 15:31.880
Right now, he's stuck on the road
waiting for help so they can clear it.

15:32.440 --> 15:33.480
There's no snow.

15:34.800 --> 15:35.800
Right.

15:37.760 --> 15:41.160
Let me take a drag of your blunt.
I'm super tense tonight.

15:46.840 --> 15:48.320
When is Mom coming?

15:49.480 --> 15:50.760
No idea.

16:02.440 --> 16:05.360
THE NICKEL-PLATED FEET

16:08.920 --> 16:09.840
You'll be fine.

16:11.480 --> 16:12.640
Talking is key.

16:13.840 --> 16:14.680
That's nice.

16:17.480 --> 16:20.720
Well... What can I do to thank you?

16:20.800 --> 16:21.720
Nothing at all.

16:22.440 --> 16:24.760
After everything you told me,

16:25.640 --> 16:26.560
this is my mitzvah.

16:28.000 --> 16:28.840
My mitzvah.

16:30.160 --> 16:33.360
It's a good deed you do for humanity.

16:33.440 --> 16:37.560
Like going to a stranger's funeral,

16:38.040 --> 16:41.160
or doing some matchmaking
among your friends.

16:41.720 --> 16:43.120
Or bringing a family together.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.360
Exactly.

16:44.440 --> 16:45.280
I see.

16:46.280 --> 16:47.840
Here, you should put this

16:48.440 --> 16:49.280
on your door.

16:50.400 --> 16:51.240
It protects you.

16:51.320 --> 16:52.240
What is it?

16:52.320 --> 16:53.320
It's a mezuzah.

16:54.320 --> 16:55.840
It protects homes.

16:57.000 --> 16:58.480
Keeps...

16:58.560 --> 17:00.120
axes away.

17:04.040 --> 17:04.880
Thank you.

17:04.960 --> 17:06.120
You're welcome.

17:54.760 --> 17:56.120
Why did you write that?

17:56.560 --> 17:57.680
Don't do that.

18:02.720 --> 18:03.560
It's snowing.

18:07.440 --> 18:09.000
Sorry I'm late.

18:09.080 --> 18:12.800
I was held captive by my ex-boss.
He locked me up.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.920
Come on.

18:16.600 --> 18:21.440
You're not going to think I'm lying every
time I speak, are you? If so, we're done.

18:24.240 --> 18:25.320
We believe you.

18:27.080 --> 18:28.560
I'm so happy.

18:30.200 --> 18:31.520
I missed you.

18:34.560 --> 18:35.400
I missed you.

18:35.480 --> 18:36.640
I missed you, too.

18:37.640 --> 18:38.560
Finally, Sonia.

18:41.000 --> 18:42.360
Sam's not here?

18:42.440 --> 18:43.320
He's coming.

18:46.400 --> 18:47.240
Hello.

20:00.280 --> 20:01.200
I'm outside.

20:04.960 --> 20:05.960
I need to talk to you.

20:08.160 --> 20:09.400
Just five minutes.

20:12.760 --> 20:13.600
Come out.

20:15.440 --> 20:16.720
I'm begging you.

20:26.680 --> 20:30.840
Ten, nine, eight, seven,

20:30.920 --> 20:35.400
six, five, four, three,

20:35.480 --> 20:37.280
two, one...

20:39.320 --> 20:40.160
zero.

21:37.080 --> 21:38.680
Maybe we should serve the turkey.

21:39.440 --> 21:41.360
We're not waiting for Sam?

21:41.840 --> 21:42.680
No.

21:44.920 --> 21:47.800
-I'll go get it.
-No, leave it, Corinne. I'll go.

21:51.560 --> 21:52.400
It's Sandrine.

21:53.320 --> 21:54.720
What did I say?

21:54.800 --> 21:55.720
"Corinne."

21:57.120 --> 21:59.240
Okay. Excuse me, Corinne.

22:00.720 --> 22:02.320
-I'll go.
-I'll go with you.

22:04.200 --> 22:05.480
When do we do gifts?

22:13.200 --> 22:14.040
Sam?

22:17.720 --> 22:18.560
Sam.

22:25.600 --> 22:26.440
I'm here.

22:52.880 --> 22:54.320
I'm so happy to see you.

23:04.600 --> 23:05.640
What happened?

23:16.880 --> 23:18.520
I posted pictures

23:19.280 --> 23:20.160
of Renan and me.

23:24.440 --> 23:26.000
His parents were so upset...

23:28.400 --> 23:29.360
His dad hit him.

23:40.880 --> 23:42.240
Oh, Sam.

23:44.520 --> 23:46.720
You couldn't know they'd react that way.

23:46.800 --> 23:47.960
Yes, of course.

23:49.080 --> 23:51.960
-But--
-I posted them to hurt him.

23:53.920 --> 23:56.800
I hurt the people I love, like you do.

24:01.160 --> 24:02.400
I blamed you for that.

24:04.080 --> 24:05.800
Because I'm exactly like you.

24:08.440 --> 24:10.360
-Exactly.
-No.

24:12.080 --> 24:12.920
You're not.

24:13.680 --> 24:16.440
You take after me, but you're not like me.

24:19.040 --> 24:20.360
He won't forgive me.

24:28.960 --> 24:29.880
What about you?

24:32.600 --> 24:34.760
Will you forgive me for everything?

24:44.000 --> 24:45.080
He'll forgive you.

24:47.000 --> 24:48.040
He will.

24:52.080 --> 24:52.920
My baby.

24:58.880 --> 25:00.560
Carole, is this good?

25:00.640 --> 25:02.000
-Yeah.
-Great.

25:03.520 --> 25:04.360
Here.

25:04.920 --> 25:07.920
-Virginie?
-Why don't we call Nonno?

25:09.080 --> 25:10.400
We should.

25:11.880 --> 25:12.880
Patrick?

25:17.160 --> 25:18.000
It's ringing.

25:19.760 --> 25:21.800
<i>Hey! Virginie, how are you?</i>

25:22.280 --> 25:23.760
-Howdy!
-Howdy, Nonno.

25:24.320 --> 25:26.320
<i>Howdy! Yeah, my daughter.</i>

25:27.800 --> 25:30.120
<i>I'm glad to see you. It's been a while.</i>

25:30.200 --> 25:31.480
So am I.

25:32.160 --> 25:33.640
-Hi, Nonno.
<i>-Hi.</i>

25:33.720 --> 25:36.440
<i>It's good to see the family together.</i>

25:36.520 --> 25:37.800
Are you still stuck?

25:37.880 --> 25:42.160
<i>Yes. I'm waiting for that thing...</i>
<i>what's it called... The...</i>

25:42.240 --> 25:43.600
The backhoe loaders.

25:44.960 --> 25:49.480
<i>I've been an idiot. I should have thought</i>
<i>about it. What was I thinking?</i>

25:49.560 --> 25:51.400
<i>I should be with you.</i>

25:51.480 --> 25:54.200
<i>Put a bottle of champagne on ice</i>
<i>for me, okay?</i>

25:54.280 --> 25:56.520
<i>-I'll come as soon as I can.</i>
-Will do.

25:57.000 --> 25:58.360
Where's Lorenzo?

25:59.480 --> 26:00.880
He said he'd come.

26:00.960 --> 26:02.920
<i>I don't know.</i>

26:07.440 --> 26:08.280
Hey?

26:19.400 --> 26:20.240
Maxence...

26:23.320 --> 26:24.160
Don't move.

26:33.080 --> 26:35.320
-Thank you so much.
-Thank you.

26:50.200 --> 26:52.160
You're a remarkable woman, Kathline.

26:53.680 --> 26:54.520
Thank you.

26:55.080 --> 26:56.960
We've been watching you a long time.

26:58.120 --> 27:00.720
We are very impressed with your work.

27:03.560 --> 27:04.400
So is he.

27:55.280 --> 27:56.280
Can we open the gifts?

27:56.360 --> 27:58.560
Right. Yeah.

28:02.800 --> 28:04.000
Mom. It's fragile.

28:04.080 --> 28:05.040
Thank you.

28:05.640 --> 28:07.520
Here, Merry Christmas.

28:08.680 --> 28:09.760
Here, Carole.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.000
Careful, it's very fragile.

28:15.760 --> 28:17.080
Lorenzo.

28:17.160 --> 28:18.760
-Opening.
-Merry Christmas.

28:18.840 --> 28:20.160
Thank you.

28:21.000 --> 28:22.480
-It's for everyone.
-Everyone.

28:23.280 --> 28:25.040
What is it?

28:25.120 --> 28:26.160
This is so cute!

28:26.240 --> 28:27.280
It's a jewelry box.

28:27.840 --> 28:30.000
It's so cute.

28:31.560 --> 28:33.960
Sorry, I didn't know you were coming.

28:34.800 --> 28:35.640
It's okay.

28:36.920 --> 28:39.200
Yes! It'll be great in my room.

28:43.240 --> 28:44.680
A T-shirt? Oh, Mom!

28:44.760 --> 28:46.120
Look!

28:51.280 --> 28:52.880
Careful, it's from Carole.

28:54.720 --> 28:56.520
Wow!

28:56.600 --> 28:57.960
It's beautiful.

28:58.960 --> 29:01.520
-Right.
-Carole, it's beautiful.

29:02.160 --> 29:04.080
It's different, but gorgeous.

29:04.160 --> 29:05.400
We'll put it on that wall.

29:05.480 --> 29:06.840
My turn.

29:07.600 --> 29:09.720
I... I have a gift

29:10.680 --> 29:12.480
for the entire family.

29:14.760 --> 29:18.640
When Patrick and I met about 20 years ago,

29:19.680 --> 29:23.560
-he wanted to take me to Latin America.
-Seriously?

29:26.640 --> 29:27.880
Mexico,

29:27.960 --> 29:29.840
Argentina...

29:29.920 --> 29:33.480
In a car, with just a camera.

29:33.560 --> 29:35.040
It was your dad's dream.

29:36.520 --> 29:39.400
But I became pregnant with Carole

29:39.480 --> 29:40.720
right away so...

29:43.560 --> 29:45.440
Then Sam came.

29:46.920 --> 29:49.520
How lucky we are.
We're so lucky we met you.

29:50.280 --> 29:53.240
For our ten-year anniversary,
we wanted to fulfill our dream...

29:54.080 --> 29:55.600
But I came in, right?

29:55.680 --> 29:56.600
Right.

29:57.160 --> 29:59.040
And what a joy it was!

30:00.640 --> 30:04.800
We never went,
so I thought maybe we could...

30:06.080 --> 30:06.920
Here.

30:08.160 --> 30:10.440
It was the right time.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.440
No way.

30:22.440 --> 30:24.400
-This is crazy.
-It's awesome.

30:29.200 --> 30:30.560
I know it's crazy.

30:31.120 --> 30:33.280
I've been thinking a lot.

30:34.360 --> 30:37.600
And I realized that being a family is...

30:40.840 --> 30:41.760
It's hard.

30:44.840 --> 30:46.920
Being a parent and a spouse is...

30:47.840 --> 30:49.880
overwhelming, almost impossible.

30:51.760 --> 30:54.360
We didn't handle it well,
your father and me.

30:55.200 --> 30:56.520
Especially me.

30:57.960 --> 30:59.400
And in recent years...

31:02.280 --> 31:03.560
something collapsed.

31:05.560 --> 31:08.360
But I think, if we get far away,
we could...

31:09.920 --> 31:13.440
see each other in a different light.
We could.

31:13.520 --> 31:16.040
Elvira, I don't think it's the right time.

31:16.720 --> 31:20.160
I don't know,
but it's worth trying, right?

31:22.640 --> 31:23.800
It's worth trying.

31:25.560 --> 31:28.480
To be together again, all of us.
To talk to each other.

31:31.200 --> 31:32.280
What do you think?

31:35.560 --> 31:36.400
What about me?

31:37.480 --> 31:38.440
I don't get one?

31:39.760 --> 31:41.280
Am I not family?

31:44.680 --> 31:46.840
Sit down, I'll bring some turkey.

31:49.040 --> 31:50.200
It's cool you're here.

31:50.920 --> 31:54.040
Well, yeah. Eventually, I figured...

31:54.720 --> 31:56.720
a family Christmas would be nice.

31:57.800 --> 31:59.600
Sam got a gift for you.

31:59.680 --> 32:01.040
-Here.
-Thanks.

32:03.040 --> 32:04.000
-Here.
-Hold on.

32:04.920 --> 32:06.040
I have something to say.

32:06.120 --> 32:07.000
No.

32:08.120 --> 32:10.920
No. It's not the right time.

32:13.440 --> 32:15.040
It will never be the right time.

32:16.840 --> 32:17.760
Why in Italian?

32:19.760 --> 32:20.760
Go on, tell them.

32:22.440 --> 32:24.000
Why don't you tell them?

32:24.080 --> 32:25.800
-What's going on?
-It's the right time.

32:25.880 --> 32:28.360
-She says this is not the right time.
-Come on.

32:28.760 --> 32:29.960
You speak Italian?

32:30.040 --> 32:31.560
-Please...
-A little.

32:33.400 --> 32:35.120
I wanted to tell you about me.

32:36.600 --> 32:38.360
Because I noticed that...

32:39.800 --> 32:42.720
you're so busy with your little problems,

32:42.800 --> 32:44.760
you don't ask questions.

32:48.240 --> 32:51.080
When I was born,
I was put in a foster home,

32:52.480 --> 32:54.320
because my mother didn't want me.

32:55.480 --> 32:57.320
I went through four families.

32:57.880 --> 32:59.080
The Bertinis...

33:00.200 --> 33:02.520
but they decided to return me,

33:02.600 --> 33:04.240
because I was always sick.

33:05.360 --> 33:06.680
Then, the Rizzos.

33:07.280 --> 33:09.000
The father and I didn't get along.

33:10.040 --> 33:11.040
He didn't like me.

33:13.720 --> 33:16.520
I left with the Contis.

33:17.200 --> 33:18.720
They were great,

33:19.400 --> 33:21.800
but when I turned 14, I had to work.

33:23.960 --> 33:25.200
The fourth one...

33:27.880 --> 33:28.800
was you guys.

33:31.160 --> 33:32.360
The Lamberts.

33:34.040 --> 33:35.640
You, too, adopted me,

33:36.480 --> 33:39.320
without knowing who I really was.

33:40.880 --> 33:42.800
Don't come any closer.

33:44.560 --> 33:45.680
What will you do?

33:45.760 --> 33:47.680
Tell them! Or I'll kill myself!

33:47.760 --> 33:50.080
-I'll kill myself!
-No, Lorenzo! Enough!

33:51.160 --> 33:52.640
-Stop it!
-Tell them.

33:53.120 --> 33:56.360
He's my son! He's my son!
There you have it.

33:56.440 --> 33:58.080
Lorenzo is my son.

33:59.040 --> 34:00.120
Drop it.

34:09.240 --> 34:10.280
Are you okay, Carole?

34:12.000 --> 34:12.840
Carole?

34:13.880 --> 34:14.719
Are you okay?

34:25.120 --> 34:25.960
Are you okay?

35:56.040 --> 35:57.000
How was Christmas?

35:58.800 --> 36:00.480
Did baby Jesus come?

36:14.520 --> 36:18.000
Have you ever heard
a thirsty seagull's call?

36:19.200 --> 36:20.040
No.

36:20.880 --> 36:22.880
It's terrifying, you know.

36:26.280 --> 36:28.520
How about you come down?
This is ridiculous.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.280
Yes, Ma'am.

36:46.760 --> 36:49.080
Are you sure you don't want to kiss me?

37:51.520 --> 37:54.000
