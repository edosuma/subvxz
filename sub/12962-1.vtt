Oh!

11:25.269 --> 11:27.480
Oh! "Charles, Assistant Botanist."

11:28.064 --> 11:29.231
Hello, Charles.

11:29.315 --> 11:31.859
Now, let's get those precious bags inside.

11:31.942 --> 11:33.361
We wouldn't want them to get wet.
Right, Charles?

11:33.444 --> 11:34.779
-(SCREECHING)
- What? Okay.

11:35.279 --> 11:37.406
"Well, now that you're inside,
just leave the peat at the door.

"Whatever you do, don't..." (GRUNTS)
"...touch anything."

11:39.617 --> 11:40.951
"Thank you. Good day."

11:41.285 --> 11:42.495
Okay. Okay, I get it.

11:44.121 --> 11:45.581
The professor seems to know you pretty well!

11:45.748 --> 11:46.749
Yeah. Yeah.

-(GRUNTING)

11:55.383 --> 11:58.302
Another job well done.
For peat's sake! Right?

11:59.095 --> 12:01.597
(LAUGHS) 'Cause it's peat!
Get it? Do you get it?

12:01.680 --> 12:02.681
Pete's sake?

12:03.182 --> 12:04.225
You're a monkey.

12:08.145 --> 12:09.730
All right! Ready for a quick tour?

12:09.814 --> 12:11.774
But the monkey said
we weren't supposed to...

12:12.024 --> 12:13.734
The monkey said, come on! You could film it!

12:13.818 --> 12:16.070
Imagine, Your own jungle movie!
I play the brave explorer.

12:16.153 --> 12:17.780
- What do you think?
- You think I could?

12:18.239 --> 12:20.408
(LAUGHS) You are... Yeah, of course!

12:20.491 --> 12:21.575

12:21.992 --> 12:24.078
Right. (CLEARS THROAT) We'll call him...

12:24.328 --> 12:25.704
Let's call him Jeff,

12:25.996 --> 12:27.331
with my companion Charlie

12:27.415 --> 12:31.293
and we're going to save the damsel
from the dark regions of the jungle.

12:34.380 --> 12:35.965
EMILE: What kind of tree is that?

12:36.674 --> 12:40.678
Well, that, Emile,
it's an Extremus Gigantis Circus uh...

12:44.390 --> 12:46.350
-(HOOTING)

12:47.184 --> 12:49.145
A sequoia? Yes. Call it a sequoia.

12:49.228 --> 12:50.896
If you prefer the generic name.

12:51.021 --> 12:54.233
Oh, my... Look at that! it's the professor's lab!

13:04.326 --> 13:06.036
Okay! What do we got? "Do not use."

13:06.120 --> 13:07.371
All right. Let's see what it does.

13:07.455 --> 13:09.540
- Are you filming?
- Yes, but it says do not use...

13:09.623 --> 13:11.041
No. (MUMBLING INDISTINCTLY)

13:12.251 --> 13:13.294

13:13.377 --> 13:14.420

13:18.382 --> 13:21.260
(SIGHS) Huh? Right. Okay, next.

13:21.927 --> 13:23.471
How about this one? "Atomise-a-tune."

That's amazing!
Charles, you have a lovely singing voice.

13:43.574 --> 13:45.576

"Super-Fertilizer." Hmm.

13:45.659 --> 13:46.744
"Unstable."

13:46.994 --> 13:49.288
Okay. Now all I need now is a little seed.

13:50.164 --> 13:53.083
From this jar, here.
A tiny drop, or two. And then we wait.

13:54.710 --> 13:56.629
And we continue to wait.

13:58.422 --> 13:59.548
And we wait.

13:59.924 --> 14:01.634
This one's a... This one's a dud.

14:01.926 --> 14:04.345

- Good idea, Emile.

14:28.953 --> 14:31.121
- I did! All of it!
-(LAUGHING)

14:31.455 --> 14:34.124
God! A sunflower that big
must produce tons of oil.

14:34.208 --> 14:36.835
This could cut Catherine's fuel budget by 10.

14:37.545 --> 14:39.630

Good night.

It's been a pleasure.

16:26.487 --> 16:28.906
You didn't see something
strange in there, did you?

16:29.490 --> 16:31.659
You mean besides a singing monkey,

16:31.742 --> 16:34.995
a 50 foot sunflower
and vials of potions that almost killed us?

16:35.079 --> 16:36.955
No. You see anything strange?

16:37.039 --> 16:39.375
(STAMMERING) You mean you didn't see
a seven foot creature

16:39.708 --> 16:42.670

and spikes all over his body?

16:42.753 --> 16:44.129

more walkways, shelters for
the poor, blankets...

18:18.557 --> 18:22.102
Forget blankets.
What's needed here is diversion.

Oh, yes, perfect. We can divert the water.

- Not water, Paté. Their minds.
- Oh.

I don't know.

Yes, of course it is, isn't it?

Well, it's just a theory but...

23:21.818 --> 23:24.362
Here is where the store window was smashed.

23:24.446 --> 23:25.489
Yes.

23:25.572 --> 23:27.824
- Here is where the children were traumatized.
- Okay.

23:27.908 --> 23:31.787
Here is where the horse was spooked
and stampeded through the lingerie shop.

23:31.870 --> 23:34.581
- See what I'm getting at?
- Uh... Actually no.

23:34.998 --> 23:37.125
There is a pattern, a logical progression,

23:37.209 --> 23:40.087
leading all the way to here.

23:40.253 --> 23:41.254
MAYNOTT: And?

23:41.463 --> 23:45.300
Well, I would like permission to do
a more thorough investigation,

23:45.383 --> 23:48.804
- Sir.
- Yes, of course, investigate away.

23:49.346 --> 23:52.474
Let the public see that we are men of action.

23:52.849 --> 23:55.102
- Thank you, sir. Thank you.
- Yeah. Hmm.

23:55.477 --> 23:57.562
But don't be too quick
at solving the case, Paté.

23:58.146 --> 24:00.065
But, sir, I should think the quicker the better.

24:00.148 --> 24:01.775
We are on the verge of a catastrophe.

24:01.858 --> 24:06.446
Where you see catastrophe, I see opportunity.

24:06.905 --> 24:08.740
You see, my dear Captain,

24:08.824 --> 24:12.160
when people are frightened
they need protection.

24:12.244 --> 24:14.538
They need someone that they can turn to,

24:15.163 --> 24:16.706
someone to believe in,

24:17.332 --> 24:18.542
a saviour,

24:19.084 --> 24:20.377
a hero.

24:20.460 --> 24:22.587
In other words, they need

24:23.964 --> 24:25.006
me!

24:30.679 --> 24:32.264
CARLOTTA: And say hello for me.
LUCILLE: Sure.

24:32.347 --> 24:33.682
CARLOTTA: No, don't.
You don't have to. No, no.

24:33.765 --> 24:35.225
I mean, well, if he mentions me.

24:35.308 --> 24:36.643
- LUCILLE: Okay!
- Oh, let me see...

24:36.726 --> 24:38.145
Darling, wait. Stop. Let me take a look.

24:38.436 --> 24:39.896
- Oh, perfect.
- Mmm-hmm?

24:50.991 --> 24:52.409
What's that?

24:53.785 --> 24:56.997
"A strange creature has been
seen in the streets of Paris."

24:59.207 --> 25:01.835
"The beast is seven feet high,
is extremely hairy,

25:01.918 --> 25:04.379
"and has two big and red eyes.

25:04.462 --> 25:07.299
"Under those circumstances,
we recommend all citizens

25:07.382 --> 25:09.176
"not to go out alone at night."

25:09.259 --> 25:10.468
Ch, great!

25:11.344 --> 25:13.180
"Be cautious and do not panic."

25:15.098 --> 25:17.225
(SCREAMS)

25:18.435 --> 25:20.478
Raoul! You scared me!
What are you doing here?

25:20.729 --> 25:22.898
You scared me! And I'm working here!

25:22.981 --> 25:25.192
- Well, I hope nothing's broken.
- No, I'm fine.

25:25.275 --> 25:27.319
I'm talking about the champagne, you idiot!

25:28.111 --> 25:29.404
Look at me! I'm a mess!

25:29.487 --> 25:31.072
Here comes the drama queen.

25:31.156 --> 25:33.617
Come on. It's nothing. Here.

25:33.742 --> 25:35.577
Give me that! You're making it worse.

25:36.244 --> 25:38.622
Oh, great. Now, I have to change again!

25:38.788 --> 25:42.083
Uh, not a bad idea.
Brown is definitely not your colour.

25:43.001 --> 25:45.212
I see. You're a fashion expert now.

25:45.295 --> 25:46.922
Very credible with that straw coat on.

25:47.005 --> 25:49.591
- It's not straw.
- I see nothing has changed.

25:49.674 --> 25:52.010
Still the same birdbrain you were
in the first grade.

25:52.093 --> 25:53.803
And you're still so, so...

25:53.887 --> 25:54.888
$0 you!

25:54.971 --> 25:57.724
- What a repartee!
-(MIMICKING) What a repartee!

25:57.807 --> 26:00.685
Oh, I'm so smart. I use words like repartee.

26:00.769 --> 26:02.562
Look at me. Look at how amazing I am!

26:02.979 --> 26:05.523
(MIMICKING) Ooh, I'm so dumb.
Oh. I fell on my butt again!

26:05.607 --> 26:09.486
(MIMICKING) I'm a star. I'm a princess.
But I sing like a frog!

26:09.569 --> 26:11.571
- Oh. I get it.
- You get what?

26:11.655 --> 26:13.448
- You're jealous.
-(LAUGHS) Oh, yeah, I'm jealous.

26:13.531 --> 26:14.741
You're jealous of my success.

26:14.824 --> 26:16.618
- It makes you feel small.
-(LAUGHS)

26:17.202 --> 26:18.578
- Listen, honey...
- Don't you honey me.

26:18.662 --> 26:21.081
Listen honey. I'm doing just fine, okay?

26:21.164 --> 26:23.583
Women like me, men want to be me,

26:24.251 --> 26:28.004
uh, men want to be with the women
who like me.

26:28.171 --> 26:30.507
And the women, uh, want to be...

26:31.007 --> 26:33.426
The men who want to be with me...

26:35.053 --> 26:36.137
I'm popular and creative.

26:36.513 --> 26:37.555
Creative?

26:37.847 --> 26:39.349
You mean that piece of junk?

26:39.891 --> 26:42.852
Don't you... Don't you dare
bring Catherine into this!

26:43.186 --> 26:46.314
If you want to see popular and creative,
come see my show one night.

26:46.481 --> 26:49.526
Oh, wait! You can't. We don't accept losers.

26:49.693 --> 26:52.988
Oh, good one. Oh, pardon me,
your Royal Pain in the Buttness.

26:53.071 --> 26:54.906
I didn't realise you had to win
the Medal of Honour

26:54.990 --> 26:56.449
to gain entrance to the Cheese Hall!

26:56.533 --> 26:59.286
In your case, the only way you
will be admitted

26:59.369 --> 27:03.039
is if you show up with that medal
pinned to your chest.

27:03.164 --> 27:05.208
It would look great on your lovely straw coat!

27:05.292 --> 27:07.502
It's not... It's not... It's not straw!

If you come with that medal,

27:13.049 --> 27:16.428
the best table will be waiting along with
all the champagne you can drink.

27:16.511 --> 27:17.595

27:39.200 --> 27:40.410
Thanks.

27:47.584 --> 27:48.626
Huh?

28:01.389 --> 28:02.724
How is it going up there?

28:03.016 --> 28:04.351
I'm close.

28:06.144 --> 28:08.188
POLICEMAN: Would you just check
over there...

28:08.396 --> 28:10.273
Let's see... Okay.

28:10.482 --> 28:11.524
There... Oh.

28:44.808 --> 28:46.476
Oh, this is a nightmare!

28:54.818 --> 28:56.820
- What's that?
- It's the monster!

28:57.153 --> 28:58.655
The monster that we created!

28:59.114 --> 29:01.408
Yes, our own monster. He's got your eyes.

29:01.783 --> 29:02.784
And, Uh, my hairy legs!

29:02.867 --> 29:03.910
What are we going to do?

29:04.702 --> 29:07.414
Everything's fine. Nothing happened.
It's not our fault.

29:08.540 --> 29:09.624
(PANTING) Besides, nobody knows
we were there!

29:09.707 --> 29:12.001
Could have been anybody!
Could have been anybody.

29:12.085 --> 29:14.170
Sorry to interrupt the show, gentlemen,

29:14.254 --> 29:16.840
but I think you are about to
be the stars of the next feature.

29:17.132 --> 29:19.175
It's called The Interrogation!

29:21.803 --> 29:23.012
(CLEARS THROAT)

29:23.096 --> 29:28.351
The way I see it, humanity is
divided in two different categories.

29:29.310 --> 29:32.730
The faceless and nameless masses

29:33.106 --> 29:36.401
living their lives like cockroaches,

29:37.152 --> 29:40.196
and those with a great destiny,

29:40.363 --> 29:42.657
those like you and me.

29:43.700 --> 29:47.203
You're very kind, Commissioner,
but I'm just a singer.

29:47.370 --> 29:48.371
Oh, don't be modest.

29:49.330 --> 29:52.375
You see, I'm due to inaugurate
the new railway.

29:53.209 --> 29:54.961
Everybody will talk about it

29:55.044 --> 29:58.423
and I would be honoured
to have you open the event

29:58.506 --> 30:01.134
and stand by my side.

30:01.217 --> 30:04.304
Because you're not just a singer,
you're a star.

30:04.888 --> 30:07.765
Shining brighter than all others,

30:07.849 --> 30:11.227
lighting the way to a brilliant future.

30:12.103 --> 30:15.565
For you, for me, for us.

30:16.191 --> 30:18.818
Uh, that's very nice of you,

30:19.235 --> 30:23.156
but don't you think it's
a little early to refer to us as "us"?

30:23.573 --> 30:25.742
(CLEARS THROAT) Excuse me?

30:26.451 --> 30:27.577
Yes, Paté?

30:27.660 --> 30:30.830
I don't mean to interrupt,
but I have extremely important news.

30:31.331 --> 30:33.041
- What?
- The monster...

30:33.500 --> 30:35.460
I have three suspects.

30:38.338 --> 30:39.422
(WHIMPERS)

30:41.216 --> 30:42.759
Now, if you'll look very closely

30:43.176 --> 30:45.178
right here, just before the explosion...

30:45.261 --> 30:46.554
See that little black dot?

30:46.638 --> 30:48.264
It's a flea from the monkey's fur.

30:48.681 --> 30:51.809
I believe that the combination
of these potions

30:52.769 --> 30:53.937
turned it into

30:59.734 --> 31:02.237
-the monster!
- Bravo, Paté!

31:02.570 --> 31:05.532
Bravo! A giant flea!

31:05.615 --> 31:08.284
This is exactly what I've been looking for!

31:08.576 --> 31:09.577
(LAUGHS)

31:10.036 --> 31:12.539
Excuse me, sir. I'm just starting out in life.

31:12.622 --> 31:13.706
I don't want to go to jail.

31:13.790 --> 31:16.376
Prison's a low-growth market
for home deliveries.

31:16.459 --> 31:18.086
Arrest the monkey! It was his flea!

31:19.337 --> 31:21.464
Prison? Who said anything about prison?

31:21.798 --> 31:23.424
This is a story about heroes.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.802
Heroes don't go to prison.

31:26.469 --> 31:28.721
- But, sir, they're guilty!
- Guilty of what?

31:28.805 --> 31:32.892
Of giving me the chance to show the public
where they can place their trust?

31:32.976 --> 31:36.396
No, no, they do not deserve to go to prison.

31:36.479 --> 31:39.983
They deserve to be celebrated,
to be honoured.

31:40.066 --> 31:41.609
They deserve...

31:44.487 --> 31:46.114
- Huh?
- Here, pick one.

31:46.322 --> 31:47.407
Uh, well...

31:47.991 --> 31:50.410
Would you have a medal of honour in there,
by any chance?

- Don't bother.

32:44.005 --> 32:46.466

32:46.591 --> 32:47.675

Why, with water.

Paris is full of water.

more aggressively to drain the streets.

I will take it and drown it.

Oh! Paté! Hello!

01:14:02.856 --> 01:14:04.817
I have a message from the Interior Minister.

01:14:04.900 --> 01:14:07.903
He's not happy with all the
destruction caused

01:14:07.986 --> 01:14:11.156
by your psychopathic chase
in pursuit of your own ambitions.

01:14:11.532 --> 01:14:16.120

I have risked my life.

Paté, I have slain the monster.

01:14:18.997 --> 01:14:21.375
- Tell that to the Minister.
- With pleasure.

01:14:21.542 --> 01:14:23.293
Victor Maynott, I am arresting you

01:14:23.377 --> 01:14:26.380
for the premeditated murder
of Monsieur Francoeur.

01:14:26.630 --> 01:14:28.632

I was so set on being a loyal officer,

01:14:32.594 --> 01:14:35.722
I did not see the road you had taken us down.

01:14:35.848 --> 01:14:38.392
I needed a flea to show me the way.

01:14:38.559 --> 01:14:42.062
Are you mad?
It was just a miserable little flea!

01:14:42.187 --> 01:14:43.814
You are so wrong, sir.

01:14:43.897 --> 01:14:46.108
There was more humanity in that flea

01:14:46.191 --> 01:14:48.902
than in the louse I see before me now!

01:14:49.027 --> 01:14:50.571
