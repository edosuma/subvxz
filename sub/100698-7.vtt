00:02.040 --> 00:03.880
-This hurt Ben and Maddie.
- Previously...

00:03.880 --> 00:06.210
There is place
where sound heals.

00:06.210 --> 00:07.540
What's the talking about?

00:07.540 --> 00:10.170
Secret place
where sound is kept.

00:13.290 --> 00:15.420
This sound. They're real.

00:15.420 --> 00:18.250
These must be the voices
of your ancestors, Ryn.

00:18.250 --> 00:23.170
As of today, I have injected
myself with three doses.
Five injections.

00:23.170 --> 00:26.080
Today, I doubled my dosage
of aquatic stem cells.

00:26.080 --> 00:29.210
-What are the limits?
-You say you'll be loyal to me.

00:29.210 --> 00:31.790
Yet you fought for Ryn.
So I ask again.

00:31.790 --> 00:33.000
Why should I trust you?

00:34.170 --> 00:36.790
She has a baby.

00:36.790 --> 00:38.790
-This is our friend, Ryn.

00:38.790 --> 00:41.330
Ryn, stop!

00:41.330 --> 00:43.170
He's from the other tribe.

00:43.170 --> 00:44.920
-Why'd you come?
-It's true.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.210
-What?
-I'm one of them.

00:50.170 --> 00:52.580
I can explain,
but I'm not your enemy.

00:52.580 --> 00:54.210
Ryn's entire colony
was just wiped out.

00:57.880 --> 01:00.210
I didn't know anything
about that. I swear.

01:00.210 --> 01:01.880
Maddie, I didn't know anything--

01:01.880 --> 01:04.880
Who are you? Really?

01:04.880 --> 01:07.000
Just give me a sec, okay?

01:24.500 --> 01:25.670
I need a minute.

01:27.460 --> 01:29.250
-Maddie, please...

01:50.120 --> 01:51.920
I was going to tell you.

01:53.330 --> 01:54.880
I swear.

01:56.380 --> 01:58.120
But then we found that body
in the freezer.

01:59.670 --> 02:02.000
I had to be sure you and Ben
weren't a threat.

02:05.000 --> 02:07.580
The lectures.
The fundraising.

02:07.580 --> 02:09.790
The socially inept dork?

02:10.960 --> 02:12.330
That's me.

02:15.290 --> 02:18.460
Maddie, just come
back inside.

02:18.460 --> 02:20.120
And let me explain.

02:27.620 --> 02:29.670
I've never seen one
like you before.

02:29.670 --> 02:31.960
Your tribe doesn't
leave the North.

02:31.960 --> 02:33.500
No. Not usually.

02:33.500 --> 02:35.420
-No.
-How far north?

02:35.420 --> 02:37.040
Off the coast of Alaska.

02:37.040 --> 02:40.420
My people are isolationists.

02:40.420 --> 02:43.420
And fierce warriors.
That's why others stay away.

02:43.420 --> 02:45.750
How long have you been on land?

02:45.750 --> 02:48.000
- Fifteen years.
-If they never leave Alaska,

02:48.000 --> 02:50.750
they couldn't have been
involved with what happened
to your tribe, Ryn.

02:50.750 --> 02:53.000
Right.
That's what I'm trying to say.

02:53.000 --> 02:54.880
-I'm not your enemy.
- Okay.

02:54.880 --> 02:56.670
Then we should
work together.

02:56.670 --> 02:58.540
Another tribe
has started a war.

02:58.540 --> 03:01.670
If your people are as fierce
as Ryn says they are,

03:01.670 --> 03:03.920
then maybe they can help.

03:03.920 --> 03:05.880
I don't think so.

03:05.880 --> 03:08.880
They'd only fight on their terms
and on their turf.

03:08.880 --> 03:11.080
If your tribe does not help,
there will be no stopping Tia.

03:11.080 --> 03:13.790
Who's Tia?

03:15.000 --> 03:16.420
Tia is a tyrant.

03:16.420 --> 03:18.500
Her atrocities
will continue

03:18.500 --> 03:19.830
until she's stopped.

03:19.830 --> 03:21.960
I still hear them.

03:23.210 --> 03:25.210
Hear who, dear?

03:25.210 --> 03:27.210
My people.

03:27.210 --> 03:29.500
Scream. In pain.

03:50.040 --> 03:51.620
Tia is strong.

03:51.620 --> 03:53.210
-With many followers.
- Right.

03:53.210 --> 03:55.460
But even if she controlled
all the tribes in the waters,

03:55.460 --> 03:57.040
she's still massively
outnumbered by humans.

03:57.040 --> 03:58.750
Right. She'd need
some kind of weapon

03:58.750 --> 04:01.170
if she wanted
to kill us all.

04:01.170 --> 04:03.710
Something a little more
destructive than a spear, yes.

04:03.710 --> 04:05.620
The song.

04:09.080 --> 04:10.500
That's the only
weapon she'd need.

04:10.500 --> 04:12.000
But Tia cannot sing.

04:13.330 --> 04:14.500
Her song was cut from her.

04:16.040 --> 04:18.380
That's why she's
building an army.

04:18.380 --> 04:20.540
I mean, the song
was powerful enough

04:20.540 --> 04:22.120
to drive Decker to suicide.

04:22.120 --> 04:26.380
If used on a large scale,
the damage would be massive.

04:28.380 --> 04:30.120
We gotta stop her.

04:30.120 --> 04:33.250
You must ask
your tribe for help.

04:36.120 --> 04:38.000
We didn't exactly part
on the best of terms.

04:38.000 --> 04:40.170
If I go alone
they won't agree.

04:40.170 --> 04:42.000
But if we go together,
it might show

04:42.000 --> 04:43.460
how serious this is.

04:43.460 --> 04:45.380
-Yes.
- We can't just take Ryn

04:45.380 --> 04:46.960
on a plane to Alaska.

04:46.960 --> 04:48.080
She doesn't even
have a real ID.

04:49.290 --> 04:51.380
Right.

04:51.380 --> 04:53.210
Right.

04:53.210 --> 04:55.710
But one of my investors
in Seattle

04:55.710 --> 04:57.500
has a twin engine.

04:57.500 --> 04:59.290
I can get him on the phone.

05:07.290 --> 05:10.080
You're healing nicely.

05:10.080 --> 05:12.920
Your time will come
to join the others.

05:12.920 --> 05:14.830
The others look for baby?

05:16.380 --> 05:17.750
Some.

05:17.750 --> 05:20.460
The rest swim north,

05:20.460 --> 05:22.120
recruiting more
for our cause.

05:23.420 --> 05:24.580
After that...

05:26.080 --> 05:27.920
we take the fight
to the humans.

05:34.040 --> 05:36.500
If something
were to happen to us,

05:36.500 --> 05:38.500
this is where we're going.

05:38.500 --> 05:40.620
Are you sure that now
is the best time

05:40.620 --> 05:42.420
for you guys to leave?

05:42.420 --> 05:46.120
The fight's getting bigger, Xan.
We're gonna need help.

05:46.120 --> 05:48.330
Okay, well, what can I do?

05:48.330 --> 05:50.120
My baby is in the water.

05:50.120 --> 05:53.210
If Levi brings her back,
he'll come looking for me here.

05:53.210 --> 05:54.920
We just need you wait here
at my place

05:54.920 --> 05:57.250
until we get back.

05:57.250 --> 05:58.380
All right.

05:58.380 --> 06:00.210
All right. Yeah.

06:00.210 --> 06:01.170
You're a good friend.

06:03.380 --> 06:05.080
You guys just...

06:05.080 --> 06:06.540
just be safe out there.

06:12.670 --> 06:14.420
Just like a bird.

06:16.040 --> 06:17.620
Yeah.

06:17.620 --> 06:21.170
Planes help people travel
all over the world.

06:22.420 --> 06:24.620
Why do people travel?

06:24.620 --> 06:27.790
Sometimes they're forced to.

06:27.790 --> 06:29.170
Like you were.

06:30.880 --> 06:32.330
Sometimes,
if they're lucky,

06:32.330 --> 06:36.750
they get to travel for work,
on a business trip.

06:36.750 --> 06:38.540
That's what we're doing.

06:38.540 --> 06:42.670
And if they're really lucky,
they get to travel just for fun.

06:42.670 --> 06:45.040
It's called a vacation.

06:45.040 --> 06:47.080
Thank you.

06:47.080 --> 06:48.670
Thanks for
coordinating this.

06:48.670 --> 06:51.710
Oh, no, of course.

06:51.710 --> 06:53.620
Hey, listen, I know I dropped
a bomb on you today--

06:53.620 --> 06:57.170
Look, I get you needing
to protect your secret.

06:57.170 --> 06:58.710
I do.

06:58.710 --> 07:01.080
But what's happening
is bigger than you and me,

07:01.080 --> 07:03.830
and we need
to focus on that.

07:06.170 --> 07:07.790
Nice ride.

07:07.790 --> 07:10.750
Yeah, best I could do
on short notice,

07:10.750 --> 07:12.420
-There you go.
-She will get us there.

07:15.170 --> 07:16.580
Ryn, excited for
your first flight?

07:16.580 --> 07:17.920
Yes.

07:17.920 --> 07:19.580
Important business trip.

07:25.580 --> 07:26.790
Here. You'll need this.

07:37.040 --> 07:38.210
Hey, hey, it's okay.

07:40.040 --> 07:42.210
It's just the engines.
Remember what I told you?

07:42.210 --> 07:43.540
Yes.

07:43.540 --> 07:46.420
Flying is bumpy and loud.

08:04.080 --> 08:05.540
Hey.

08:07.080 --> 08:08.830
It's okay.

08:08.830 --> 08:10.210
Look.

08:10.210 --> 08:11.920
Look out there.

08:58.960 --> 09:01.080
Can I help you?

09:01.080 --> 09:03.080
We're looking
for Ben Pownall.

09:03.080 --> 09:04.670
Yeah, he's--

09:04.670 --> 09:06.120
He isn't here.

09:06.120 --> 09:07.670
You know where he is?

09:07.670 --> 09:09.460
I'm sorry,
who are you guys?

09:09.460 --> 09:11.460
I'm Commander Anderson.

09:11.460 --> 09:13.080
This is Lieutenant Maeda.

09:13.080 --> 09:15.330
And, what, you're with
the Research Facility?

09:15.330 --> 09:18.080
What's your relationship
to Mr. Pownall?

09:18.080 --> 09:19.540
Oh.

09:19.540 --> 09:22.500
I mean, we're not really
into labels, but...

09:24.250 --> 09:26.210
We're friends.

09:26.210 --> 09:28.040
I'm just staying at his place
while he's out of town.

09:28.040 --> 09:29.170
When will he be back?

09:30.540 --> 09:31.920
What's this about?

09:33.380 --> 09:35.040
If you hear from him,

09:35.040 --> 09:36.500
have him call us at that number,
Mr. McClure.

09:39.830 --> 09:41.960
Hey, how'd you know my name?

09:41.960 --> 09:43.540
Hey!

09:48.170 --> 09:50.540
You saw Donna
in the spirit world.

09:50.540 --> 09:52.620
Yes.

09:52.620 --> 09:54.080
When you gave me
the sea herb.

09:57.580 --> 09:59.620
Why? What's-- What's wrong?

09:59.620 --> 10:01.170
I said the herb
was dangerous.

10:02.330 --> 10:03.500
What have I done?

10:05.790 --> 10:08.080
You and Donna's spirit
are together now.

10:08.080 --> 10:09.500
Together?

10:10.750 --> 10:12.120
She needs you.

10:12.120 --> 10:13.750
You must help her,

10:13.750 --> 10:15.380
or she will never
leave you.

10:28.380 --> 10:30.580
My tribe has been here
for generations.

10:30.580 --> 10:33.750
The place was so isolated
it kept my people protected.

10:33.750 --> 10:35.790
It makes sense they never left.

10:35.790 --> 10:37.540
Yeah, but even this far north,

10:37.540 --> 10:39.500
the waters became more and more
polluted over time.

10:39.500 --> 10:41.420
If the water is bad,
why stay?

10:41.420 --> 10:43.500
Lots of reasons.

10:46.380 --> 10:49.620
My people are pretty stubborn
in their ways.

10:50.960 --> 10:52.750
Any chance that's changed?

10:54.080 --> 10:55.830
Not likely.

10:58.790 --> 11:00.170
-Look out!

11:02.500 --> 11:04.420
- Everyone okay?
- Yeah.

11:10.210 --> 11:12.000
What is that?

11:12.000 --> 11:13.790
That's a bear.

11:15.880 --> 11:17.080
Big bear.

11:19.000 --> 11:21.080
Welcome to Alaska.

11:27.830 --> 11:29.250
I take it we're close?

11:29.250 --> 11:30.880
Yeah. Closer than
you think.

11:35.210 --> 11:36.620
Beautiful.

11:37.830 --> 11:39.120
Frozen.

11:39.120 --> 11:41.120
We'll need a different spot

11:41.120 --> 11:42.580
for you to go in the water.

11:42.580 --> 11:45.420
Uh, yeah, actually...

11:45.420 --> 11:47.040
I can't transform.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.380
What do you mean?

11:48.380 --> 11:51.120
I mean, I'm stuck this way.

11:51.120 --> 11:52.620
Human.

11:52.620 --> 11:56.290
I went between the land
and ocean too many times,

11:56.290 --> 11:58.420
and now, when I go in the water,

12:00.080 --> 12:01.670
nothing happens.

12:01.670 --> 12:05.250
And you waited
until now to tell us?

12:05.250 --> 12:07.790
How long were you on land
when this happened?

12:07.790 --> 12:09.330
A few years.

12:09.330 --> 12:12.120
Transforming
would take longer

12:12.120 --> 12:14.920
and became more painful.

12:14.920 --> 12:18.080
Then one day, I stopped
transforming entirely.

12:20.040 --> 12:23.080
Look, we can still make
contact from the fishing hut.

12:23.080 --> 12:25.040
The ice should hold.

12:25.040 --> 12:26.120
Should?

12:26.120 --> 12:27.420
Hey.

12:29.080 --> 12:30.670
Wait here.

12:30.670 --> 12:32.170
Be careful.

13:20.960 --> 13:24.040
Okay. So, what now?

13:24.040 --> 13:26.750
We go fishing.

13:26.750 --> 13:28.040
That's your plan?

13:28.040 --> 13:30.120
To bribe your people
to the surface?

13:30.120 --> 13:32.750
It's not a bribe.
It's an offering.

13:32.750 --> 13:34.580
Rainbow trout
are freshwater fish.

13:34.580 --> 13:37.120
That's a delicacy for my people.

13:37.120 --> 13:39.040
You say "offering"

13:39.040 --> 13:41.920
like it's a common
practice around here.

13:41.920 --> 13:43.210
Mm-hm.

13:43.210 --> 13:45.620
That's why this hut exists.

13:45.620 --> 13:48.880
My tribe has a special
relationship with the locals.

13:50.170 --> 13:52.000
You know, it started
during a harsh winter.

13:52.000 --> 13:54.380
The townsfolk were starving,
and my people were able

13:54.380 --> 13:56.210
to provide them with
enough fish to make it

13:56.210 --> 13:58.620
until supplies could arrive.

13:58.620 --> 14:01.120
-Pretty friendly gesture.
-Yeah.

14:01.120 --> 14:04.170
Well, neither species
contacts the other

14:04.170 --> 14:06.120
unless it's a matter
of life and death.

14:16.880 --> 14:19.120
Well, that's it.

14:20.330 --> 14:21.830
Let's wait outside.

14:34.120 --> 14:35.500
It's been hours.

14:35.500 --> 14:37.920
You sure this is
going to work?

14:37.920 --> 14:40.040
It always has.

14:43.500 --> 14:45.040
Enough waiting.

14:45.040 --> 14:46.710
I will go find Robb's people.

14:46.710 --> 14:48.830
Ryn, no.

14:48.830 --> 14:51.210
It's too dangerous
to go alone.

14:51.210 --> 14:53.040
Hey.

14:53.040 --> 14:55.750
We've come this far, okay?

14:55.750 --> 14:57.790
Let's just wait.

15:39.790 --> 15:41.290
They're here.

16:35.040 --> 16:36.210
Yura.

16:38.540 --> 16:41.040
After all this time,
you dare return?

16:41.040 --> 16:45.120
I wouldn't have come back
if it wasn't for good reason.

16:45.120 --> 16:47.210
-Just hear me--

16:47.210 --> 16:49.620
-Whoa, whoa, wait!
-No, no!

16:50.880 --> 16:52.710
We're not here to fight.

17:02.170 --> 17:05.960
Another tribe has started
a war in the water.

17:05.960 --> 17:07.620
Many of my people are dead.

17:07.620 --> 17:09.210
Their leader will not stop

17:09.210 --> 17:12.670
until every tribe
joins her or dies.

17:12.670 --> 17:16.710
We came here to warn you,

17:16.710 --> 17:18.120
and to ask for your help.

17:19.170 --> 17:21.710
I am sorry for your people.

17:22.880 --> 17:24.080
But he betrayed us
when he left.

17:25.750 --> 17:27.420
Yura, I went to land

17:27.420 --> 17:30.210
to find a way of cleaning
the oceans for good.

17:30.210 --> 17:32.710
To help our entire species,
not just our tribe.

17:32.710 --> 17:34.460
You were chosen.

17:34.460 --> 17:36.500
Meant to provide us
with children for generations.

17:36.500 --> 17:39.040
But you abandoned us.

17:39.040 --> 17:41.750
You left us to die.

17:41.750 --> 17:43.290
And that is what happened.

17:46.170 --> 17:47.670
The other males?

17:47.670 --> 17:49.000
All dead.

17:50.040 --> 17:51.380
What about the pool?

17:51.380 --> 17:53.170
I've gone in many times.

17:53.170 --> 17:55.210
but the waters are damaged.

17:55.210 --> 17:56.290
Deny us the ability to change.

18:00.380 --> 18:03.540
We will not help you
fight your fight.

18:14.120 --> 18:15.960
What did she mean by,

18:15.960 --> 18:18.120
"The waters deny us
the ability to change"?

18:19.330 --> 18:21.040
I'll show you.

18:27.000 --> 18:30.250
Every member of my tribe
is born female.

18:31.790 --> 18:33.250
Everyone?

18:33.250 --> 18:35.120
Yeah.

18:35.120 --> 18:38.000
But my people can change sex

18:38.000 --> 18:41.500
to transition from female
to male in order to reproduce.

18:41.500 --> 18:45.420
Several species of reptiles
and fish can do it.

18:45.420 --> 18:47.330
It's not uncommon in nature.

18:47.330 --> 18:49.170
How do you change?

18:50.960 --> 18:53.210
This pool.

18:53.210 --> 18:57.880
My tribe selects the best
individuals for procreation.

18:57.880 --> 18:59.250
They go in female
and come out male.

19:06.920 --> 19:08.380
This is ocean water?

19:08.380 --> 19:10.380
Yeah.

19:10.380 --> 19:12.540
There must be a hidden channel
running under the beach.

19:12.540 --> 19:15.790
Yura says this water is damaged.

19:19.080 --> 19:20.920
Everything I've been
trying to do...

19:22.710 --> 19:23.880
all too late.

19:25.710 --> 19:28.880
Without this pool to transition,

19:28.880 --> 19:30.790
my people are as good as dead.

19:44.460 --> 19:45.920
Let's just check in.

19:49.250 --> 19:50.460
Good evening, folks.

19:50.460 --> 19:53.080
Welcome to Smokey's Lodge.

19:53.080 --> 19:54.290
Good to see you.

19:54.290 --> 19:56.920
Is this your first time
here in Nome?

19:56.920 --> 19:58.500
Uh, yes.

19:58.500 --> 20:00.620
Well, alrighty, then.

20:00.620 --> 20:02.120
Looking for a room?

20:02.120 --> 20:04.080
No, we have a reservation
under Wellens.

20:05.460 --> 20:06.880
Well, there it is.

20:06.880 --> 20:08.290
Anyway...

20:10.080 --> 20:11.500
I'll be right back.

20:17.080 --> 20:18.250
Hey.

20:24.880 --> 20:26.210
Poor bear.

20:26.210 --> 20:27.830
Here are your keys.

20:31.170 --> 20:33.040
Did you guys want
Room 6 or 7?

20:35.500 --> 20:37.460
We'll take 7.

20:53.290 --> 20:56.120
Maddie wanted
to stay with Robb,

20:56.120 --> 20:57.210
not with us.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.170
Maybe they wanted
to be alone.

21:01.170 --> 21:03.500
Things change.

21:03.500 --> 21:05.000
People change.

21:06.790 --> 21:08.120
You are also changing.

21:10.380 --> 21:11.710
What do you mean?

21:11.710 --> 21:13.670
I sense it in you.

21:13.670 --> 21:16.120
You felt Hope's
heartbeat.

21:17.790 --> 21:21.000
You fought with the strength
of my people.

21:21.000 --> 21:22.880
How can you do
these things?

21:25.210 --> 21:28.290
The injections
we were giving my mother...

21:29.540 --> 21:31.170
I've been using them on myself.

21:31.170 --> 21:32.920
Why would you do this?

21:32.920 --> 21:34.920
I needed to make sure
that they were safe.

21:34.920 --> 21:36.500
if we were going
to keep using them.

21:36.500 --> 21:38.250
-You could have hurt yourself.
-But I didn't.

21:38.250 --> 21:40.460
The opposite happened.

21:40.460 --> 21:43.080
It made me better.

21:43.080 --> 21:45.000
I heal faster.

21:45.000 --> 21:47.120
My reflexes
are incredible.

21:47.120 --> 21:50.750
With each injection I can stay
underwater longer and longer.

21:52.460 --> 21:54.120
Ryn...

21:54.120 --> 21:56.040
I feel closer to you.

22:12.170 --> 22:14.170
I just want you to be safe.

22:29.580 --> 22:31.290
I can sleep on the floor.

22:31.290 --> 22:33.210
Don't be ridiculous.

22:37.790 --> 22:39.210
Hey, I'm-- I'm sorry.

22:40.790 --> 22:43.080
As if being from the water
wasn't enough.

22:43.080 --> 22:45.210
Now you have to cope with
the fact that I was born female.

22:46.580 --> 22:48.210
I don't care about that.

22:52.210 --> 22:54.460
Uh, there-- There is
one more thing.

22:54.460 --> 22:56.330
What's that?

22:58.170 --> 23:01.330
If I get too hot,
I can't sleep.

23:01.330 --> 23:04.120
It's almost like you grew up
in glacial waters or something.

23:05.580 --> 23:06.960
Is this okay?

23:06.960 --> 23:08.170
Yeah.

23:12.540 --> 23:13.710
Very okay.

23:16.210 --> 23:20.040
I promise no more surprises.

23:20.040 --> 23:21.790
-I'm an open book.
-Good.

23:21.790 --> 23:23.710
Because we need to be
on the same page

23:23.710 --> 23:25.710
if we're going to fix
what's wrong with the pool.

23:25.710 --> 23:28.880
Do you want to help Yura even
though she refused to help us?

23:28.880 --> 23:30.880
I think it's the only way
she'll come around.

23:30.880 --> 23:32.380
Yeah, right.

23:32.380 --> 23:35.120
Well...
I mean, there's no telling

23:35.120 --> 23:37.080
what's keeping the females
from transitioning.

23:37.080 --> 23:40.120
Oil seepage,
microplastics.

23:40.120 --> 23:42.120
I mean,
even greenhouse gases

23:42.120 --> 23:43.710
could upset the chemical makeup
of the water.

23:43.710 --> 23:45.960
What? What is it?

23:45.960 --> 23:47.460
You gave me an idea.

23:47.460 --> 23:49.210
Come on.

23:55.080 --> 23:56.250
It's Maddie.

23:59.080 --> 24:00.460
Yes?

24:00.460 --> 24:02.040
Oh, uh, sorry.

24:02.040 --> 24:03.380
Whoa.

24:03.380 --> 24:04.960
Hello, Robb.

24:04.960 --> 24:06.620
Hi, Ryn.

24:06.620 --> 24:08.500
I think I know what's preventing
Yura's transition.

24:08.500 --> 24:10.670
You know, I think you guys got
this covered. I'm gonna--

24:10.670 --> 24:12.040
Excuse me.

24:12.040 --> 24:14.620
Let's meet downstairs
in ten minutes.

24:14.620 --> 24:16.250
Okay. Hurry.

24:31.420 --> 24:33.210
Oh, my God!

24:35.080 --> 24:37.170
-What is wrong?
-The bed!

24:37.170 --> 24:39.330
I see nothing.

24:42.750 --> 24:44.460
It was there. I...

24:44.460 --> 24:46.460
I saw it.

24:46.460 --> 24:48.120
Saw what?

24:48.120 --> 24:49.250
Blood.

24:51.620 --> 24:53.420
Lots of blood.

24:55.120 --> 24:57.080
Right where Donna died.

25:03.210 --> 25:05.170
I was right.
There's an accumulation

25:05.170 --> 25:07.080
along the edge of the rock.

25:07.080 --> 25:09.920
There are microplastics
in your waters.

25:11.460 --> 25:13.250
These are preventing your tribe
from transitioning.

25:15.040 --> 25:17.330
Bad water kept my tribe
from having babies.

25:17.330 --> 25:19.500
I don't understand.

25:19.500 --> 25:23.170
Plastics contain a dangerous
compound, called BPA.

25:23.170 --> 25:26.170
Over time, plastics in the water
release a chemicals

25:26.170 --> 25:27.960
that mimic estrogen.

25:27.960 --> 25:29.380
Too much
estrogen in the water

25:29.380 --> 25:31.250
can deny you
the ability to change.

25:33.040 --> 25:36.540
Yura, if we can return your pool
back to normal...

25:36.540 --> 25:38.540
if you and your people

25:38.540 --> 25:42.210
can change from female
to male again,

25:42.210 --> 25:44.380
will you join our fight?

25:47.670 --> 25:49.120
You help us...

25:50.040 --> 25:51.380
we will help you.

25:55.460 --> 25:58.040
You call these
explosives?

25:58.040 --> 26:00.880
This will kill humans?

26:02.080 --> 26:04.620
In a way, yes.

26:04.620 --> 26:06.290
I go with you?

26:06.290 --> 26:08.170
Not this time.

26:10.000 --> 26:11.170
Stay here.

26:16.790 --> 26:19.120
You know, a few years back
I worked with some scientists

26:19.120 --> 26:21.580
who believed they could rid
the oceans of microplastics

26:21.580 --> 26:24.120
by magnetizing
the water somehow.

26:24.120 --> 26:25.830
-But plastic isn't magnetic.
-I know,

26:25.830 --> 26:27.830
but it didn't matter.

26:27.830 --> 26:29.080
The oceans were too big
to pull it off.

26:30.330 --> 26:31.920
Seen that look before.

26:31.920 --> 26:34.210
What is it?

26:34.210 --> 26:37.790
Imagine this is Yura's pool

26:37.790 --> 26:40.000
polluted with microplastics.

26:40.000 --> 26:42.920
Now, eater is polar.

26:42.920 --> 26:44.460
Oil is non-polar.

26:44.460 --> 26:46.920
When there's an oil spill
in the water,

26:46.920 --> 26:50.710
all sorts of non-polar things,
like plastic, bond to the oil.

26:50.710 --> 26:52.830
You want to pour oil
into the pool?

26:52.830 --> 26:54.380
Something non-toxic,

26:54.380 --> 26:56.960
like vegetable oil.

26:56.960 --> 26:59.920
So the vegetable oil
separates the microplastics
from the water.

26:59.920 --> 27:02.080
That still doesn't
solve the problem.

27:02.080 --> 27:05.670
Not until we magnetize the oil.

27:05.670 --> 27:08.540
Now, magnetite is the most
magnetic mineral on Earth.

27:08.540 --> 27:10.960
It's also harmless.

27:12.170 --> 27:13.830
Now, when added to the oil...

27:22.210 --> 27:26.580
we can use magnets to remove
the microplastics from the pool.

27:28.290 --> 27:30.080
It sounds great,

27:30.080 --> 27:33.250
but we're a little off
the beaten path here, guys.

27:33.250 --> 27:34.710
Where do you plan
on getting magnetite?

27:36.670 --> 27:37.830
Right.

27:39.210 --> 27:41.290
I think I might be able
to get some.

27:43.420 --> 27:45.670
So this Jeremy guy,

27:45.670 --> 27:47.880
how well do you know him?

27:47.880 --> 27:49.250
After I got
my land legs under me,

27:49.250 --> 27:51.960
I went to a local university
outreach program.

27:51.960 --> 27:53.040
Jeremy teaches there.

27:53.040 --> 27:55.790
He sponsored
my education.

27:55.790 --> 27:57.460
Do my eyes deceive me?

27:57.460 --> 27:59.460
Environmentalist
Robb Wellens?

27:59.460 --> 28:01.120
Dashingly handsome
environmentalist.

28:01.120 --> 28:02.920
-Don't short me.

28:05.120 --> 28:07.750
-Jeremy, Ben. Ben, Jeremy.
-How are you doing?

28:07.750 --> 28:09.250
Were you able to get
everything we need?

28:09.250 --> 28:11.500
Wow, straight to business, huh?

28:11.500 --> 28:13.080
I guess some people
never change.

28:13.080 --> 28:15.790
Yeah, I raided
the school's chem lab.

28:15.790 --> 28:18.250
I got magnets,
magnetite powder.

28:18.250 --> 28:21.040
-Great.
-What are you up to?

28:21.040 --> 28:23.250
Nothing unusual.
Just trying to save the world.

28:25.000 --> 28:26.120
Come on.

28:28.170 --> 28:30.120
I like Robb.

28:30.120 --> 28:31.580
He is very kind.

28:33.170 --> 28:34.080
I like him too.

28:36.540 --> 28:37.710
Robb is love?

28:41.290 --> 28:42.960
I'm not sure yet.

28:49.040 --> 28:52.120
Ryn, however I feel
about Robb,

28:52.120 --> 28:55.750
that will never change
how special you are to me.

29:05.170 --> 29:07.000
I had to save one of them
for my fryers.

29:07.000 --> 29:10.040
So, what's all this for anyway?

29:10.040 --> 29:13.210
Oil helps females
become male.

29:14.330 --> 29:15.750
Alrighty then.

29:15.750 --> 29:17.620
Glad I could help.

29:21.250 --> 29:23.210
Come on.

29:30.040 --> 29:31.620
Xander.

29:31.620 --> 29:33.000
I've been looking for you.

29:37.120 --> 29:39.380
I am being haunted.

29:39.380 --> 29:41.080
By Donna.

29:41.080 --> 29:43.080
Have you seen her?

29:43.080 --> 29:44.170
All the time.

29:46.210 --> 29:48.040
Every time I draw my weapon
in training.

29:48.040 --> 29:51.120
That's all I can see,
is her face.

29:51.120 --> 29:52.960
Wait...

29:52.960 --> 29:55.580
when you say haunted,

29:55.580 --> 29:56.920
you mean...

29:56.920 --> 29:58.210
Exactly what it sounds like.

29:58.210 --> 30:00.170
Shit.

30:00.170 --> 30:02.330
I'm sorry.
If there's anything I can do...

30:04.170 --> 30:05.790
One fishing boat's an accident.

30:05.790 --> 30:07.120
But three sink in the same day?

30:07.120 --> 30:09.000
That ain't coincidence.

30:09.000 --> 30:11.540
Probably some damn crazy
vegan animal rights activists.

30:11.540 --> 30:13.380
Probably. All them boats
sank up north...

30:13.380 --> 30:15.250
You think that could be...?

30:15.250 --> 30:16.420
Tia?

30:19.000 --> 30:20.040
Definitely.

30:33.620 --> 30:35.210
Yeah, that's the last of it.

30:36.830 --> 30:40.250
I'm used to the humans
relying on my people for help.

30:40.250 --> 30:42.540
Not the other way around.

30:42.540 --> 30:45.210
These humans are very smart.

30:45.210 --> 30:48.250
They help give me a baby
when no one else could.

30:49.790 --> 30:51.170
You have a baby?

30:51.170 --> 30:53.080
Hope.

30:53.080 --> 30:55.380
She's beautiful.

30:55.380 --> 30:57.330
Strong.

30:57.330 --> 31:01.420
She is also why I ask
for help against Tia.

31:01.420 --> 31:04.080
We fight for more
than ourselves now.

31:06.250 --> 31:07.540
That's it.
That should do it.

31:07.540 --> 31:10.120
You have fixed our problem?

31:12.580 --> 31:13.710
We've done all we can.

31:15.620 --> 31:17.210
We will learn
if you have succeeded.

31:18.580 --> 31:19.710
Tonight.

31:55.790 --> 31:56.920
Shit.

32:38.170 --> 32:39.380
-Robb?
-Hm?

32:43.580 --> 32:44.920
You said it yourself.

32:44.920 --> 32:46.380
We did all we could.

32:46.380 --> 32:48.080
We just have to wait.

32:48.080 --> 32:50.500
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

32:50.500 --> 32:53.040
There's just so much
riding on this.

32:53.040 --> 32:54.120
For my people.

32:54.120 --> 32:55.580
For Ryn.

32:55.580 --> 32:56.880
I know.

32:58.210 --> 32:59.790
Hey, listen...

33:01.290 --> 33:03.710
I didn't tell you
everything right away,

33:03.710 --> 33:07.170
because I thought
it would be too much.

33:09.580 --> 33:10.710
It's not.

33:17.040 --> 33:20.460
What matters is
who you are in here.

33:25.790 --> 33:27.290
That hasn't changed.

33:53.080 --> 33:57.710
What Robb said about not being
able to transform anymore...

33:59.580 --> 34:01.670
did you know
that could happen?

34:02.960 --> 34:04.170
No.

34:05.540 --> 34:08.880
But I think about it a lot.

34:12.080 --> 34:14.960
I don't want to choose

34:14.960 --> 34:16.670
between land and water.

34:21.540 --> 34:23.750
These injections
I've been taking...

34:25.380 --> 34:27.710
if you had
to stay in the water...

34:29.380 --> 34:31.920
maybe there's a chance
I could come visit you.

34:39.380 --> 34:40.580
Let's find out.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.540
That's our people's way
of saying thanks.

36:53.540 --> 36:55.080
So...

36:56.040 --> 36:57.210
you will help us?

36:58.330 --> 36:59.710
I stand by my word.

37:01.380 --> 37:03.170
We will join your fight.

37:09.250 --> 37:11.920
You left to save our people.

37:13.290 --> 37:14.620
You have succeeded.

37:17.210 --> 37:19.210
If you wish to,
I invite you to stay.

37:21.920 --> 37:24.210
You'd let me rejoin,
even though I can't transform?

37:25.500 --> 37:27.170
We are stronger
with you here.

37:28.170 --> 37:29.330
As a family.

37:34.170 --> 37:35.250
Thank you.

37:35.250 --> 37:37.210
I'd be honored.

37:49.830 --> 37:52.120
I don't know
what else to do.

37:52.120 --> 37:55.880
If you can hear me, Sarge,

37:55.880 --> 37:57.620
I need your help.

38:11.500 --> 38:14.250
Donna's spirit
keeps visiting me

38:14.250 --> 38:16.000
from beyond.

38:16.000 --> 38:18.380
Do you know what she wants?

38:21.670 --> 38:23.460
Mm.

38:38.120 --> 38:40.250
Of course.

38:40.250 --> 38:42.120
She's not at peace.

38:45.120 --> 38:46.750
Thank you.

38:56.830 --> 38:58.500
They're the only family
you've ever known.

38:58.500 --> 38:59.920
I get it.

39:01.460 --> 39:03.080
Thank you for understanding.

39:04.250 --> 39:06.460
It's not permanent.
I will be back.

39:06.460 --> 39:08.120
I hope so.

39:08.120 --> 39:10.120
In the meantime,

39:10.120 --> 39:11.920
I can be the eyes and ears
on this side of the world

39:11.920 --> 39:13.500
until the Tia situation
is resolved.

39:13.500 --> 39:16.170
And after that?

39:19.170 --> 39:20.750
There's a lot of ocean
left to clean up.

39:20.750 --> 39:22.380
Can't let my investors down.

39:23.920 --> 39:25.580
That's who you're
thinking about?

39:25.580 --> 39:27.120
Your investors?

39:27.120 --> 39:28.580
Uh...

39:28.580 --> 39:30.500
Who should I be
thinking about?

39:33.540 --> 39:34.880
I'm gonna miss you.

39:34.880 --> 39:36.120
Yeah.

39:36.120 --> 39:37.880
I'm gonna miss you too.

40:01.790 --> 40:03.210
What do you think
of Alaska?

40:03.210 --> 40:04.790
Good business trip.

40:06.580 --> 40:09.080
Maybe next time we'll go
somewhere a little warmer.

40:09.080 --> 40:10.620
For a vacation?

40:13.170 --> 40:14.330
Yeah.

40:18.460 --> 40:21.210
Our swim was very special to me.

40:24.670 --> 40:26.330
Yeah.

40:26.330 --> 40:29.120
Me too.
