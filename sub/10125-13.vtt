FIND A BETTER CROWD,

LOOKING FOR US.

WHY DON'T WE
ASK HIM?

04:20.133 --> 04:21.734

THINK ABOUT IT.

04:26.400 --> 04:29.567

WE'RE THERE.

04:29.567 --> 04:30.600

04:30.600 --> 04:32.767

LIKES POETRY,

IN THE FAMILY BUSINESS,

BEEN SET FOR LIFE.

WANTED HIS OWN LIFE.

07:51.000 --> 07:54.000
HE DIDN'T
WANT HIS FAMILY'S LIFE,

07:54.000 --> 07:55.200
WHICH
CAUSED DISAGREEMENTS

07:55.200 --> 07:56.300
BETWEEN HIM AND MELANIE.

07:56.300 --> 07:57.300
YOU UNDERSTAND?

HE GAVE UP THE GOOD LIFE
AND ALL THAT MONEY

10:03.500 --> 10:06.200
SHE'LL WALK IN HERE,
FUR COAT, JEWELRY.

10:06.200 --> 10:08.133
SHE'LL TAKE ONE LOOK
AROUND THIS APARTMENT,

10:08.133 --> 10:10.200
CRITICIZE MY LIFESTYLE,

10:10.200 --> 10:12.100
THEN JUST GO ON BACK
TO THAT BIG HOUSE

10:12.100 --> 10:13.500
AND ALL THAT MONEY.
JUST WATCH.

10:13.500 --> 10:18.133
WOULD YOU BE UPSET
IF I WENT WITH HER?

10:19.400 --> 10:20.900
HI, JOHN.

10:20.900 --> 10:24.700
OH, IT HAS BEEN
WAY TOO LONG.

10:25.767 --> 10:28.467
NICE PLACE.

10:28.467 --> 10:30.900
YOU KNOW, IT KIND
OF REMINDS ME OF MINE.

10:30.900 --> 10:32.667
HI. YOU MUST BE SHAWN.

10:32.667 --> 10:34.600
HI. YOU MUST
BE MONEY--MELANIE.

10:40.700 --> 10:41.934
CORY!

10:41.934 --> 10:43.033
ARE YOU ALONE?

10:43.033 --> 10:45.367
NO. I TRIED TO
ESCAPE ON MY BIKE,

10:45.367 --> 10:48.000
BUT FRANKIE JOGGED
BEHIND ME THE ENTIRE WAY.

10:48.000 --> 10:51.100
POUND FOR POUND,
HE'S EARTH'S FASTEST MAN.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.500
THANK YOU, MY FRIEND.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.867
I ENJOYED OUR LITTLE WORKOUT.

10:55.867 --> 10:59.233
NOW, IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I MUST REPLENISH FLUIDS.

10:59.233 --> 11:02.400
CORY, THE GUY
INVITED ME TO HIS HOUSE

11:02.400 --> 11:03.700
FOR A SLUMBER PARTY.

11:03.700 --> 11:07.033
OH, YOU'RE GOING
TO BE THERE, TOO?

11:07.033 --> 11:08.033
YES! THAT'S GREAT.

11:08.033 --> 11:09.033
YOU'RE NOT HELPING.

11:09.033 --> 11:12.667
MY MOM SAID EVERYONE
HAS GOOD QUALITIES.

11:12.667 --> 11:14.500
HE DOESN'T HAVE
ANY GOOD QUALITIES.

11:14.500 --> 11:15.500
HE'S A THUG.

11:15.500 --> 11:16.934
WELL, NOW HE'S OUR THUG.

11:16.934 --> 11:18.900
LET'S JUST FIND THE GOOD.

11:18.900 --> 11:20.133
WHAT GOOD?

11:20.133 --> 11:21.133
COME ON.

11:21.133 --> 11:23.200
WHEREVER HE GOES,
PEOPLE SCATTER.

11:23.200 --> 11:25.667
WATCH THIS GUY
GIVE HIM HIS BURGER.

11:25.667 --> 11:27.400
FROM YOUR
HUMBLE SERVANT--
TURKEY.

11:27.400 --> 11:30.667
I HOPE THAT'S
NOT A PROBLEM.

11:31.734 --> 11:33.100
AND THOSE 7th GRADERS

11:33.100 --> 11:35.033
JUST GIVE UP
THEIR TABLE.

11:35.033 --> 11:37.000
YEAH. THEY
BOW DOWN TO HIM

11:37.000 --> 11:39.800
LIKE HE'S THE KING
OF THE SCHOOL.

11:39.800 --> 11:41.233
CORY?

11:41.233 --> 11:42.233
YEAH?

11:42.233 --> 11:45.367
I THINK WE
HAVE FOUND THE GOOD.

11:45.367 --> 11:47.300
LET US BE SURE.

11:47.300 --> 11:50.000
AHEM! IF ANYONE
NEEDS ME OR SHAWN,

11:50.000 --> 11:51.600
WE'LL BE SITTING
RIGHT HERE

11:51.600 --> 11:55.700
WITH OUR NEW BEST FRIEND
FRANKIE STECCHINO.

11:59.200 --> 12:00.400
HA HA.

12:00.400 --> 12:01.767
THANK YOU.

12:03.967 --> 12:05.600
FRANKIE, BUDDY.

12:05.600 --> 12:08.000
WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN
ALL OUR LIVES?

12:08.000 --> 12:09.767
AROUND.

12:17.667 --> 12:18.767
MELANIE, THIS
IS A DIFFERENT LOOK
FOR YOU--

12:18.767 --> 12:20.767
JEANS AND A T-SHIRT,
HUH?

12:20.767 --> 12:22.467
DADDY CUT OFF
THE CREDIT CARDS?

12:22.467 --> 12:24.467
I HAVE MY OWN
CREDIT CARDS NOW.

12:24.467 --> 12:28.200
I STARTED MY OWN
LITTLE BUSINESS.

12:28.200 --> 12:31.300
YOU DRESS THIS WAY
TO MAKE ME FEEL
COMFORTABLE?

12:31.300 --> 12:34.934
I DRESS THIS WAY TO
MAKE ME FEEL COMFORTABLE.

12:34.934 --> 12:37.867
THIS IS WHAT
I WEAR TO WORK.

12:37.867 --> 12:40.300
I STARTED MY OWN
LITTLE BOOKSTORE.

12:40.300 --> 12:41.233
YOU DON'T WORK
FOR YOUR FATHER?

12:41.233 --> 12:44.667
NOPE. NOPE. NOT FOR
A FEW YEARS NOW. NO.

12:44.667 --> 12:48.300
YOU'RE NOT THE ONLY ONE
WHO CAN CHANGE THEIR LIFE.

12:48.300 --> 12:49.600
IF I REMEMBER
CORRECTLY,

12:49.600 --> 12:52.500
YOU WEREN'T TOO HAPPY
WHEN I CHANGED MINE.

12:52.500 --> 12:55.100
YEAH. I REMEMBER.

12:55.100 --> 12:58.300
ACTUALLY, THAT'S,
UM, WHY I CALLED.

12:58.300 --> 13:01.100
WHY, MEL,
WHY DID YOU CALL?

13:01.100 --> 13:04.967
WHEN YOU SAID
THAT YOU WERE GOING
TO BECOME A SCHOOLTEACHER,

13:04.967 --> 13:08.600
I WAS ANGRY AT YOU FOR
THROWING AWAY YOUR LIFE,

13:08.600 --> 13:11.400
BECAUSE I THOUGHT
IT WAS JUST SO GREAT

13:11.400 --> 13:12.500
BEING THIS RICH KID.

13:12.500 --> 13:14.667
IT WAS.
IT WAS A GOOD LIFE,

13:14.667 --> 13:17.834
BUT, EVENTUALLY,
YOU HAVE TO FIND
YOUR OWN LIFE.

13:17.834 --> 13:19.734
YEAH, BUT I DIDN'T WANT TO,

13:19.734 --> 13:22.033
AND WHAT MADE ME
REALLY ANGRY

13:22.033 --> 13:24.934
WAS THAT I KNEW
THAT ONCE YOU DID IT,

13:24.934 --> 13:27.467
THAT SOMEDAY I WAS GOING
TO HAVE TO DO IT, TOO.

13:27.467 --> 13:32.467
THAT SCARED ME BECAUSE
I REALLY LOVED MY BEAMER.

13:32.467 --> 13:36.400
THOSE SEATS
BENT ALL THE WAY BACK,
DIDN'T THEY?

13:36.400 --> 13:37.467
YEAH, JOHN.

13:37.467 --> 13:41.400
SO, ANYWAY, I GUESS
THE REASON I CALLED

13:41.400 --> 13:42.500
WAS THAT, UM...

13:42.500 --> 13:46.100
I WANTED YOU TO KNOW
THAT I WAS TRYING,

13:46.100 --> 13:49.467
AND NOW THAT
WE KNOW WHO WE ARE,

13:49.467 --> 13:54.000
HOPEFULLY, YOU CAN
THINK OF ME DIFFERENTLY.

13:54.000 --> 13:56.400
YOU STILL
HAVE THE BEAMER?

13:56.400 --> 14:00.400
HEY, A GIRL'S GOT
TO GET AROUND, YOU KNOW.

14:04.467 --> 14:08.300
AH, THE LUNCHTIME RUSH,
AND NOWHERE TO SIT.

14:08.300 --> 14:10.100
WHAT SHALL WE DO...

14:10.100 --> 14:11.600
FRANKIE?

14:11.600 --> 14:15.367
WELL, LOOK,
A CONVENIENT OPENING.

14:15.367 --> 14:17.100
YEAH. YOU SEE THAT, FRANKIE?

14:17.100 --> 14:19.467
YOU HANG WITH US,
THE SEATS JUST OPEN.

14:19.467 --> 14:20.867
I SEE IT DIFFERENT.

14:20.867 --> 14:24.967
YOU KNOW, GUYS,
I'VE BEEN THINKING
ABOUT OUR FRIENDSHIP,

14:24.967 --> 14:26.100
AND IT DAWNS ON ME--

14:26.100 --> 14:28.600
WHAT KIND OF FRIENDS
ARE WE? NO, REALLY?

14:28.600 --> 14:29.700
BEST FRIENDS.

14:29.700 --> 14:35.000
FRANKIE, WE VALUE
YOUR FRIENDSHIP VERY MUCH.

14:35.000 --> 14:36.200
DRY CLEANING!

14:36.200 --> 14:37.767
DRY CLEANING?

14:37.767 --> 14:38.767
THEY GOT THE STAIN OUT.

14:38.767 --> 14:41.500
THANKS, YOUNG MAN.
YOU'RE TOO KIND.

14:41.500 --> 14:42.667
WHAT'S YOUR NAME AGAIN?

14:42.667 --> 14:44.000
ROBERT.

14:44.000 --> 14:45.367
NO, NOT ANYMORE.

14:45.367 --> 14:47.400
FROM NOW ON, YOU ARE...

14:47.400 --> 14:50.567
DANCES WITH SWEATERS.

14:51.600 --> 14:53.600
I LIKE IT.

15:00.300 --> 15:02.734
FRANKIE, WHERE
ARE YOU GOING?

15:02.734 --> 15:06.400
I NEED TO BE ALONE
AND REFLECT.

15:06.400 --> 15:09.133
WHAT'S THE MATTER
WITH HIM?

15:14.867 --> 15:18.600
MIND IF I SIT WITH YOU GUYS?

15:26.300 --> 15:28.300
LOST YOUR WAY,
MR. STECCHINO?

15:28.300 --> 15:31.367
METAPHORICALLY SPEAKING,
YES, MR. FEENY.

15:31.367 --> 15:34.467
I FOUND SOME NEW FRIENDS,
AS YOU YOURSELF SUGGESTED.

15:34.467 --> 15:37.800
YES. MR. HUNTER AND
MR. MATTHEWS. WELL DONE.

15:37.800 --> 15:38.834
I'M NOT SO SURE.

15:38.834 --> 15:41.400
YOU SAID HANGING
WITH A BETTER CROWD

15:41.400 --> 15:43.567
WOULD MAKE ME
A BETTER PERSON,

15:43.567 --> 15:44.667
YET HERE I WANDER,

15:44.667 --> 15:48.900
LIKE THE ISRAELITES IN
THE DAYS OF YUL BRYNNER.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.934
YOU'RE OVER MY HEAD,
MR. STECCHINO.

15:52.934 --> 15:55.767
I'M STILL
FRANKIE THE ENFORCER.

15:55.767 --> 15:57.400
AHH, SO YOUR NEW FRIENDS

15:57.400 --> 16:00.233
ARE NOT WHAT
YOU'D HOPED THEY'D BE?

16:00.233 --> 16:02.700
IT'S ALWAYS THE SAME,
MR. FEENY.

16:02.700 --> 16:04.600
HARLEY AND JOEY,
CORY AND SHAWN--

16:04.600 --> 16:07.467
THEY JUST SEE THIS BIG GUY
EVERYBODY FEARS

16:07.467 --> 16:09.400
AND USE MY POWER FOR EVIL.

16:09.400 --> 16:11.000
WHY DO YOU LET THEM?

16:11.000 --> 16:12.600
IF PRESSED,
I'D HAVE TO ADMIT

16:12.600 --> 16:14.734
I WANT THEM TO LIKE ME.

16:14.734 --> 16:15.800
IS THAT SO WRONG?

16:15.800 --> 16:18.800
EVERYONE WANTS
TO BE LIKED, FRANKIE.

16:18.800 --> 16:20.900
EVEN YOU, MR. FEENY?

16:20.900 --> 16:22.200
DON'T TELL THE STUDENTS.

16:22.200 --> 16:25.200
IT WOULD
ONLY CREATE CHAOS.

16:25.200 --> 16:28.133
WHEN WILL THEY STOP
TAKING ADVANTAGE OF ME?

16:28.133 --> 16:30.900
AS SOON AS YOU
STAND UP TO THEM.

16:30.900 --> 16:33.100
LET THEM KNOW
HOW YOU FEEL.

16:33.100 --> 16:34.200
I CAN DO THAT?

16:34.200 --> 16:35.400
THAT, MR. STECCHINO,

16:35.400 --> 16:37.934
IS THE TEST
OF A REAL FRIENDSHIP.

16:37.934 --> 16:41.734
BUT WHAT IF CORY AND
SHAWN FAIL THAT TEST?

16:41.734 --> 16:42.734
AH-HEH.

16:42.734 --> 16:44.934
WELCOME TO MY LIFE.

16:49.233 --> 16:51.767
<i>SHAWN, THIS </i>
<i>IS FRANKIE STECCHINO. </i>

16:51.767 --> 16:53.967
<i>I FEEL THAT YOU </i>
<i>AND CORY AND ME </i>
<i>NEED TO TALK </i>

16:53.967 --> 16:55.800
<i>IF WE'RE REALLY </i>
<i>GOING TO BE FRIENDS, </i>

16:55.800 --> 16:57.200
<i>BECAUSE IT OCCURS TO ME </i>

16:57.200 --> 16:59.667
<i>YOU DON'T KNOW </i>
<i>WHO I REALLY AM. </i>

16:59.667 --> 17:01.867
<i>CALL ME AT YOUR </i>
<i>EARLIEST CONVENIENCE. </i>

17:01.867 --> 17:03.400
<i>RUFF! RUFF! </i>
<i>GRR! RUFF! </i>

17:03.400 --> 17:07.000
<i>PLEASE, DAD, </i>
<i>I'M ON THE PHONE. </i>

17:07.000 --> 17:08.800
<i>[BEEP] </i>

17:08.800 --> 17:10.233
SO SHE
ACTUALLY APOLOGIZED

17:10.233 --> 17:11.967
FOR THE WAY IT ENDED?

17:11.967 --> 17:14.867
YEAH. WE HAD A GREAT
TIME LAST NIGHT.

17:14.867 --> 17:17.400
WHEN ARE WE MOVING
TO CONNECTICUT?

17:17.400 --> 17:18.834
WE'RE STAYING
RIGHT HERE.

17:18.834 --> 17:21.667
THAT'S PROBABLY
BETTER, JOHN.

17:21.667 --> 17:23.500
ALL THAT MONEY
WOULD ONLY SPOIL ME.

17:23.500 --> 17:27.400
BY THE WAY, WOULD A PILLOW
BE TOO MUCH TO ASK FOR?

17:27.400 --> 17:30.133
SHE WAS MOST SORRY

17:30.133 --> 17:33.200
THAT SHE ONLY KNEW ME
AS THIS RICH MAN'S KID.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.233
SHE NEVER KNEW WHO I WAS
OR TRIED TO KNOW.

17:36.233 --> 17:38.200
ALL THAT TIME TOGETHER

17:38.200 --> 17:39.600
AND YOU WEREN'T
REALLY FRIENDS.

17:39.600 --> 17:43.500
WHEN YOU'RE YOUNG,
FIRST IMPRESSIONS
ARE EVERYTHING.

17:43.500 --> 17:44.800
SOMETIMES
YOU COMPLETELY MISS

17:44.800 --> 17:46.400
WHO SOMEONE REALLY IS,
YOU KNOW?

17:54.200 --> 17:55.200
CORY, WHAT'S GOING ON?

17:55.200 --> 17:57.200
WHY DID YOU
WANT TO MEET ME?

17:57.200 --> 17:58.200
I DIDN'T.

17:58.200 --> 18:00.200
I GOT A MESSAGE THAT YOU
WANTED TO MEET ME.

18:00.200 --> 18:02.400
WHAT? THAT MAKES NO SENSE.

18:02.400 --> 18:05.734
MAKES A LOT OF SENSE TO ME.

18:05.734 --> 18:07.500
DANCES?

18:07.500 --> 18:09.400
'TWAS I WHO
CALLED YOU BOTH.

18:09.400 --> 18:12.500
WE 7th GRADERS
AREN'T GOING TO
TAKE IT ANYMORE.

18:12.500 --> 18:14.567
NO MORE GIVING
UP OUR FOOD

18:14.567 --> 18:15.667
OR DOING
YOUR ERRANDS.

18:15.667 --> 18:17.500
WHAT ABOUT
MY DRY CLEANING?

18:17.500 --> 18:18.967
FINISHED!

18:18.967 --> 18:21.567
YEAH? SAYS YOU
AND WHAT ARMY?

18:21.567 --> 18:22.567
MY ARMY.

18:22.567 --> 18:24.467
[SNAPS FINGERS]

18:29.500 --> 18:32.400
WE'RE KIDDING.
WE LOVE YOU GUYS.

18:32.400 --> 18:34.734
CHANGING YOUR TUNE?

18:34.734 --> 18:36.033
TUNE CHANGERS?

18:36.033 --> 18:38.900
ROBERT, WE CAN TALK.
WE CAN WORK THIS OUT.

18:38.900 --> 18:43.934
NOT SO TOUGH WITHOUT
YOUR ENFORCER, EH, BOYS?

18:45.000 --> 18:46.367
FRANKIE!

18:46.367 --> 18:47.767
FRANKIE?

18:47.767 --> 18:49.600
RUN!

18:50.667 --> 18:52.200
WAIT! WAIT! WAIT! WAIT!

18:52.200 --> 18:53.567
GUYS, GUYS, WAIT.

18:53.567 --> 18:55.900
WHAT ARE YOU RUNNING FROM?

18:55.900 --> 18:57.300
FRANKIE
THE ENFORCER.

18:57.300 --> 19:00.200
THAT'S ONLY WHAT
YOU THINK OF HIM AS.

19:00.200 --> 19:01.500
WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

19:01.500 --> 19:02.567
GO ON, LEAVE!

19:02.567 --> 19:03.834
GO BACK
TO YOUR LOCKERS

19:03.834 --> 19:07.200
NO, NO! CORY,
I GOT SOMETHING TO SAY.

19:07.200 --> 19:09.600
I MEAN, HAVE ANY OF YOU

19:09.600 --> 19:13.367
EVER REALLY LOOKED
AT FRANKIE STECCHINO?

19:13.367 --> 19:15.500
YEAH. UPSIDE DOWN.

19:15.500 --> 19:18.734
NO. I MEAN,
REALLY LOOKED AT HIM.

19:18.734 --> 19:19.934
I BET NOBODY HERE KNOWS

19:19.934 --> 19:24.100
THAT THIS MAN
HAS A VERY POETIC SOUL.

19:25.200 --> 19:28.300
YEAH. YOU KNOW, HE DOES.

19:28.300 --> 19:30.667
I MEAN, HE GOES
TO POETRY READINGS.

19:30.667 --> 19:31.834
YEAH. THAT'S RIGHT,

19:31.834 --> 19:37.834
AND, BELIEVE ME,
DEEP DOWN HE'S GENTLE.

19:37.834 --> 19:40.600
YEAH, AND YOU
GUYS SHOULD FORGET

19:40.600 --> 19:44.367
ABOUT WHAT
YOU THINK HE IS,
ALL RIGHT?

19:44.367 --> 19:45.600
AND--AND JUST...

19:45.600 --> 19:46.834
TAKE A GOOD LOOK AT HIM

19:46.834 --> 19:49.600
AND GIVE HIM
A REAL CHANCE...

19:49.600 --> 19:53.300
KIND OF LIKE
WE SHOULD HAVE.

19:55.367 --> 19:57.467
HE'S SHOWING HIS TEETH!

19:57.467 --> 19:59.100
RUN!

20:03.700 --> 20:05.300
I'M SORRY, MAN. WE TRIED.

20:05.300 --> 20:09.133
ALL THAT STUFF YOU SAID,
DID YOU MEAN IT?

20:09.133 --> 20:10.800
OR, ONCE AGAIN, WERE YOU

20:10.800 --> 20:14.800
JUST TRYING TO AVOID
AN INDESCRIBABLE PAIN?

20:14.800 --> 20:17.100
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:18.500 --> 20:21.133
I THINK I WANT
TO GRAB A BURGER

20:21.133 --> 20:22.800
WITH MY TWO NEW FRIENDS.

20:22.800 --> 20:24.367
WHAT DO YOU THINK?

20:24.367 --> 20:25.767
SOUNDS GOOD TO ME.

20:25.767 --> 20:29.233
YEAH. WE CAN GET
TO KNOW EACH OTHER.

20:38.567 --> 20:41.300
FRANKIE, WE'RE LUCKY
TO HAVE A FRIEND
LIKE YOU.

20:41.300 --> 20:42.667
RIGHT BACK AT YOU.

20:42.667 --> 20:44.500
CAN'T WAIT TO SEE
YOUR DAD WORK TONIGHT.

20:44.500 --> 20:46.300
THE MATCH IS
AT WHAT TIME?

20:46.300 --> 20:48.567
VADER TIME!

20:48.567 --> 20:50.600
WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!

20:50.600 --> 20:54.967
PAPA, YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE
IN CHARACTER ALL THE TIME.

20:54.967 --> 20:56.100
SORRY, SON,

20:56.100 --> 20:59.300
I JUST--I JUST
GET SO WORKED UP

20:59.300 --> 21:02.000
WHEN I'M
DEFENDING MY BELT,

21:02.000 --> 21:03.200
AND NO ONE,

21:03.200 --> 21:04.767
I MEAN, NO ONE,

21:04.767 --> 21:07.300
IS GOING TO TAKE IT
FROM ME,

21:07.300 --> 21:10.233
AND THAT INCLUDES <i>YOU,  </i>
LITTLE MAN!

21:10.233 --> 21:12.767
TRY IT. GO AHEAD.
TRY IT!

21:12.767 --> 21:13.800
I WOULD NEVER.

21:13.800 --> 21:14.800
TRY IT!

21:14.800 --> 21:16.600
IT'S TOO MUCH METAL
FOR ME, REALLY.

21:16.600 --> 21:17.834
COME ON!

21:17.834 --> 21:21.033
I'D NEVER MAKE IT
THROUGH AIRPORT SECURITY.

21:21.033 --> 21:24.100
CORY, WHO'S BARKING
IN THE KITCHEN?

21:24.100 --> 21:26.367
GRR!

21:26.367 --> 21:27.600
I AM, LITTLE LADY.

21:27.600 --> 21:30.300
YOU GOT A PROBLEM
WITH VADER?

21:30.300 --> 21:34.100
BRING IT ON. GRR.

21:34.100 --> 21:37.367
OH, KNOCK IT OFF, FRANCIS.

21:37.367 --> 21:39.000
YOU KNOW, YOU
DON'T ACT THIS WAY

21:39.000 --> 21:40.467
AT THE PTA MEETINGS.

21:40.467 --> 21:43.400
SO, FRANKIE, WORD
AROUND THE HALLS

21:43.400 --> 21:44.600
IS YOU'VE GONE SOFT.

21:44.600 --> 21:47.000
THE ENFORCER
IS NO MORE, SIR.

21:47.000 --> 21:49.600
ERIC, JUST LEAVE HIM
ALONE, ALL RIGHT?

21:49.600 --> 21:51.300
AFTER ALL
HE'S DONE TO ME,

21:51.300 --> 21:52.367
GIVE ONE GOOD
REASON.

21:52.367 --> 21:55.000
I'M GOING TO
GIVE YOU THREE.

21:55.000 --> 21:56.767
WOOF! WOOF! WOOF!

21:56.767 --> 21:58.834
RAH!

21:58.834 --> 22:01.200
SOMEBODY GET HIM A BONE!
