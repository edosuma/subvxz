Oh, he said that I had a beautiful voice

16:17.115 --> 16:20.854
and that I should sing, but
you know me, I'm too shy, so...

16:20.854 --> 16:22.070
[laughs]

16:22.070 --> 16:23.905
And we had this thing going
on together for a while

16:23.905 --> 16:26.205
but, you know, it didn't work out.

16:26.205 --> 16:29.382
- Oh, let me guess he was married
and he forgot to tell you?

16:32.585 --> 16:33.795
- Is this is your house?

16:33.795 --> 16:34.825
You got interesting furnitures.

16:34.825 --> 16:35.975
- It's Uncle Ivan's.

16:35.975 --> 16:36.808
We're just staying here until

16:36.808 --> 16:38.405
we can afford a place of our own.

16:38.405 --> 16:39.238
- Oh, okay.

16:40.205 --> 16:41.038
Well...

16:42.755 --> 16:44.755
You've got a guy? Oh, tell me.

16:44.755 --> 16:46.785
Is he cute?
- Yeah.

16:46.785 --> 16:48.465
And he's with me.

16:48.465 --> 16:50.345
- Oh, thank you, but I'm not a slut.

16:50.345 --> 16:51.635
- Yeah, well you stole
one of my boyfriends.

16:51.635 --> 16:53.195
Do you remember?
[Margot chuckles]

16:53.195 --> 16:54.195
- The one in London?

16:55.295 --> 16:56.675
We were like 12 or something.

16:56.675 --> 16:59.095
- I was 19 and I was in love.

16:59.095 --> 17:00.915
So I see that you remember.

17:00.915 --> 17:02.185
- Hey.

17:02.185 --> 17:05.203
I wanted to tell you
thank you for helping me.

17:05.203 --> 17:07.825
I really appreciate it.

17:07.825 --> 17:09.125
- I'll show you your room.

17:18.815 --> 17:21.925
- Yeah. That's lovely.

17:21.925 --> 17:23.992
I'm going to love it here.

17:29.405 --> 17:30.855
- Okay.

17:30.855 --> 17:32.945
So get yourself settled in

17:32.945 --> 17:35.125
and then sort your life out, okay?

17:35.125 --> 17:36.198
I'm not a babysitter.

17:38.225 --> 17:40.125
I'll be in the kitchen if you need me.

17:46.285 --> 17:49.368
[soft, quirky music]

18:09.925 --> 18:14.925
[birds chirping]
[soft, acoustic music]

18:28.348 --> 18:29.541
- [Margot] 10 years they've together.

18:29.541 --> 18:30.374
- [Carol] Really?

18:30.374 --> 18:31.207
- [Margot] They're moving to Majorca.

18:31.207 --> 18:32.861
- [Carol] Oh, I would
love to go to Majorca.

18:32.861 --> 18:34.074
- [Margot] Oh, I know, paradise.

18:34.074 --> 18:34.997
- Is it?
- Yeah.

18:34.997 --> 18:36.545
- I didn't know that.
- So good.

18:36.545 --> 18:37.378
- Hey.

18:37.378 --> 18:38.405
Margot?

18:38.405 --> 18:40.425
- Oh.
- Finally we meet.

18:40.425 --> 18:41.915
- Hey, babe.
- Hi, Chad.

18:41.915 --> 18:43.165
That's my brother-in-law.

18:44.025 --> 18:47.255
Nice to meet you. [chuckles]

18:47.255 --> 18:48.475
- Hey babe.

18:48.475 --> 18:49.308
How was work?

18:49.308 --> 18:50.141
- It was fine.

18:53.635 --> 18:55.855
So, um, this is Margot and she's going

18:55.855 --> 18:57.695
to be staying with us for a few days.

18:57.695 --> 18:58.775
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

18:58.775 --> 18:59.938
Yeah, I got that.

19:02.575 --> 19:04.055
- So you worked today?

19:04.055 --> 19:04.935
- [Chad] Yeah.

19:04.935 --> 19:06.615
Yeah, Cindy wanted to swap again.

19:06.615 --> 19:07.515
She was hung over.

19:08.745 --> 19:09.755
- What do you do?

19:09.755 --> 19:12.825
- Uh, I'm an ambulance
driver at the hospital.

19:12.825 --> 19:14.405
- Saving lives and shit?

19:14.405 --> 19:16.375
- He only brings people in and out.

19:16.375 --> 19:17.925
- [Chad] Oh, it's pretty sweet.

19:18.965 --> 19:23.045
- So she comes to dad's
birthday party smashed, okay?

19:23.045 --> 19:25.995
So she arrives, she picks up grandma's dog

19:25.995 --> 19:28.275
in front of grandma,
throws it into the pool,

19:28.275 --> 19:30.082
because she thinks it's a dragon.

19:30.082 --> 19:31.525
[laughing]

19:31.525 --> 19:33.855
- The world got amazing improvement

19:33.855 --> 19:37.995
in like music and arts in
the 70s because of acid.

19:37.995 --> 19:41.025
Your wife. So narrow-minded.

19:41.025 --> 19:41.858
[Carol laughs]
Yeah.

19:41.858 --> 19:44.335
- Oh-ho here we go.
- My wife?

19:44.335 --> 19:45.645
- Yes, again.

19:45.645 --> 19:46.478
Yes.

19:47.645 --> 19:49.512
She always wants me to think like her.

19:49.512 --> 19:50.345
[Carol scoffs]

19:50.345 --> 19:51.695
Yep.

19:51.695 --> 19:54.505
Okay, guys, poets.

19:54.505 --> 19:58.549
They used to write on absinthe, all right?

19:58.549 --> 20:00.815
Henri Micheaux, he was
writing on mescaline.

20:00.815 --> 20:02.235
Hendrix?

20:02.235 --> 20:04.205
Playing on acid.

20:04.205 --> 20:06.995
And Jim Morrison, he thought he could use

20:06.995 --> 20:10.155
shamanism in his music to heal people.

20:10.155 --> 20:12.785
Like honestly, in a few centuries,

20:12.785 --> 20:15.625
I'm sure this is going to
be like basic knowledge.

20:15.625 --> 20:18.195
But for now, like, for
now, we're persecuted.

20:18.195 --> 20:20.135
Like the people don't understand us.

20:20.135 --> 20:21.225
- Great.

20:21.225 --> 20:25.060
Now you're on a mission to save the world.

20:25.060 --> 20:25.905
[Chad laughs]
- No!

20:25.905 --> 20:28.722
I'm just trying to be a good person.

20:28.722 --> 20:30.255
[Carol laughs]

20:30.255 --> 20:32.925
And especially, and have an open mind.

20:32.925 --> 20:35.895
- Exactly, so, you know, you're
really into art and shit.

20:35.895 --> 20:36.915
- No.

20:36.915 --> 20:39.386
She's into fucking musicians.

20:39.386 --> 20:40.219
- Oh.

20:40.219 --> 20:43.475
- Yeah, well, yeah, I
used to draw and paint.

20:43.475 --> 20:45.265
- Yeah, when you were like eight.

20:45.265 --> 20:47.125
- Oh, I think you should do more of it

20:47.125 --> 20:48.425
'cause I think it probably helps you.

20:48.425 --> 20:49.475
- No, I'm not good.

20:49.475 --> 20:51.480
I should do something better...

20:51.480 --> 20:53.565
- No, no, no, you should take acid

20:53.565 --> 20:56.654
and have a poetic vision
and save the world!

20:56.654 --> 20:58.328
- Oh fuck off, Carol.

21:01.995 --> 21:04.775
Why do always have, like, to
break my spirit like that?

21:04.775 --> 21:06.385
- Yeah.

21:06.385 --> 21:07.935
Well you know what?

21:07.935 --> 21:09.995
You need to accept your life

21:10.945 --> 21:13.155
because there's a lot of people out there

21:13.155 --> 21:16.475
who every day go and
work their shitty jobs

21:16.475 --> 21:18.805
to pay their stupid rent for
their shitty little flats

21:18.805 --> 21:21.385
because they've got no other choice.

21:21.385 --> 21:22.935
And you know what?

21:22.935 --> 21:25.365
There's nothing wrong with that.

21:25.365 --> 21:26.765
- Why don't you never dream?

21:27.625 --> 21:30.045
Like, oh, fuck. I just can't.

21:30.045 --> 21:31.628
I just can't do it.

21:32.465 --> 21:34.075
But, Carol, it doesn't
mean I'm going to be

21:34.075 --> 21:35.775
like a homeless prostitute

21:35.775 --> 21:37.575
and I'm going to end up in a gutter.

21:38.895 --> 21:41.175
I just, I want to be happy.

21:41.175 --> 21:43.345
I'm sure you want to be happy, too.

21:43.345 --> 21:44.682
- Right.

21:44.682 --> 21:45.858
Oh, we've got that in common then.

21:45.858 --> 21:47.201
- Yeah.

21:47.201 --> 21:49.261
- I think that's enough for tonight. Eh?

21:49.261 --> 21:50.451
[Chad laughs]

21:50.451 --> 21:51.638
You know what?

21:51.638 --> 21:52.757
I agree with you both.

21:52.757 --> 21:53.674
- Oh, Chad.

21:55.446 --> 21:56.975
Ugh.

21:56.975 --> 21:58.505
[kisses]

21:58.505 --> 21:59.665
- Can I grab a smoke?

21:59.665 --> 22:00.498
- Mm.

22:03.250 --> 22:04.583
- Want one?
- Mm.

22:05.974 --> 22:07.089
- Want one, sister?

22:07.089 --> 22:08.668
- What? I don't smoke.

22:08.668 --> 22:10.492
- She didn't always say that.

22:10.492 --> 22:11.325
- What?

22:12.675 --> 22:14.025
Ooh.

22:14.025 --> 22:15.785
She liked the little smokies, huh?

22:15.785 --> 22:16.618
- In London.

22:16.618 --> 22:18.785
- Oh stop it.

22:18.785 --> 22:19.945
Everyone's tried it,

22:19.945 --> 22:21.698
it's just the weak ones who can't stop.

22:21.698 --> 22:22.785
Isn't that right?

22:22.785 --> 22:24.215
- Don't know about that.

22:24.215 --> 22:26.085
I'm doing fine. How about you, Margot?

22:26.085 --> 22:26.918
- Mm.

22:27.837 --> 22:28.670
[blows]

22:28.670 --> 22:29.655
I'm great. It's so good.

22:30.653 --> 22:31.486
- So good.

22:36.555 --> 22:37.388
- Okay, fine.

22:37.388 --> 22:39.595
Just, just give me one.
- What?

22:39.595 --> 22:40.915
No, no shiny ones.

22:40.915 --> 22:41.933
No, no, no.

22:41.933 --> 22:43.276
- Oh, stop it!
- No, no, no.

22:43.276 --> 22:44.705
No, no. Here, here, here.

22:44.705 --> 22:46.325
- Come on, you're like stupid little kids.

22:46.325 --> 22:48.139
[grunting]

22:48.139 --> 22:49.181
Come on.
- Give it to me!

22:49.181 --> 22:50.483
- Give it to me!
- Come on, come on.

22:50.483 --> 22:51.393
Pass them on!

22:51.393 --> 22:52.440
- [Chad] Smoke 'em, smoke 'em!

22:52.440 --> 22:53.865
Smoke 'em all so she can't have them.

22:53.865 --> 22:56.115
[laughing]

22:57.124 --> 22:59.291
[yelling]

23:00.353 --> 23:02.853
[Chad laughs]

23:04.204 --> 23:07.267
[Carol coughs]

23:07.267 --> 23:09.684
[soft music]

23:14.703 --> 23:16.036
- So is it good?

23:18.871 --> 23:20.675
- It's disgusting.

23:20.675 --> 23:21.788
- No, I mean laughing.

23:23.951 --> 23:25.825
[Carol laughs]

23:25.825 --> 23:27.605
- Hey girls, I just got
this one rule, all right?

23:27.605 --> 23:29.145
No kissing on my chest.

23:29.145 --> 23:29.978
- Shut up, Chad.

23:29.978 --> 23:31.665
You're ruining all that stargazing shit.

23:33.765 --> 23:34.598
- My bad.

23:36.235 --> 23:39.818
[soft electric rock music]

23:48.943 --> 23:50.680
[snoring]

23:50.680 --> 23:53.597
[alarming beeping]

24:01.265 --> 24:03.682
[Chad sighs]

24:12.026 --> 24:14.443
[Chad sighs]

24:23.600 --> 24:24.683
- Chad?

24:24.683 --> 24:27.183
[Chad groans]

24:29.098 --> 24:30.681
What are you doing?

24:31.897 --> 24:32.980
- I'm just...

24:34.249 --> 24:35.082
You know.

24:36.295 --> 24:37.695
It's been such a long time.

24:37.695 --> 24:39.032
Don't you miss it, honey?

24:39.912 --> 24:40.745
- Chad.

24:42.385 --> 24:43.866
- I'll be quick.

24:43.866 --> 24:44.916
We can be real quick.

24:46.175 --> 24:47.395
- Yeah, I know.

24:48.279 --> 24:49.112
- Eh?

24:50.723 --> 24:51.556
Fine.

24:53.863 --> 24:56.280
[Chad sighs]

25:08.766 --> 25:11.266
[Carol sighs]

25:23.076 --> 25:23.909
[Margot speaks in foreign language]

25:23.909 --> 25:25.575
[Chad mumbles]
- Sorry.

25:25.575 --> 25:27.328
- Chad, did you have
to do that? Seriously?

25:27.328 --> 25:28.815
- How was I supposed to know, hm?

25:28.815 --> 25:30.818
- And can you put something on?

25:32.855 --> 25:34.005
- I'm done, you can go.

25:34.935 --> 25:35.948
- Hey, I was first.

25:39.476 --> 25:41.893
[Chad sighs]

25:51.505 --> 25:53.232
- Was the bed comfortable?

25:53.232 --> 25:54.255
- Mm, so good.

25:54.255 --> 25:55.805
- Was it?
- Morning, Chad.

25:55.805 --> 25:58.105
- Thanks for using all
the hot water, girls.

25:58.105 --> 25:59.228
Love me a cold shower.

26:01.255 --> 26:02.525
So Margot, what are you up to today?

26:02.525 --> 26:07.228
- Mm, well, I'm going to
go for a walk and think.

26:09.105 --> 26:10.235
- That's awesome.

26:10.235 --> 26:12.918
And um, think about what?

26:13.816 --> 26:15.075
- You need to have a plan Margo

26:15.075 --> 26:16.615
'cause you can't stay here forever.

26:16.615 --> 26:17.448
- Give me a break.

26:17.448 --> 26:19.245
I've been here like 13 hours or something.

26:19.245 --> 26:22.485
- No, I mean that you need
to not waste your time.

26:22.485 --> 26:23.895
You need to work at what you want.

26:23.895 --> 26:25.415
Get some clarity and structure.

26:25.415 --> 26:26.248
- You know what?

26:26.248 --> 26:27.695
She's gonna be a thinker.

26:27.695 --> 26:29.655
You know, like the great statue.

26:29.655 --> 26:31.215
- Stop that, dick. I'm
trying to be serious.

26:31.215 --> 26:32.965
- I, I am. I'm sorry.

26:32.965 --> 26:35.275
You could be like one of those
weird guys on the street,

26:35.275 --> 26:37.405
you know, where people give them money.

26:37.405 --> 26:39.985
They're like a statue and
people give them money

26:39.985 --> 26:42.885
so that you can think and earn money.

26:42.885 --> 26:43.826
It's brilliant.

26:43.826 --> 26:44.659
[Carol laughs]

26:44.659 --> 26:45.775
- Just shut up now, Chad.

26:45.775 --> 26:47.704
- Geez, you're not fun
in the morning, Carol.

26:47.704 --> 26:49.025
I'm going for a cigarette.

26:49.025 --> 26:49.951
- But you said that you were gonna quit.

26:49.951 --> 26:50.784
- [Chad] Oh, did I say I was gonna quit?

26:57.455 --> 27:00.335
- So, what do you do?

27:00.335 --> 27:01.168
Do you have a job?

27:01.168 --> 27:02.358
- I have a few.

27:03.225 --> 27:04.128
- Like what?

27:05.425 --> 27:07.475
- Mm, last one doesn't really count.

27:07.475 --> 27:09.025
It was temporary.

27:09.025 --> 27:09.925
I was dog-sitting.

27:11.135 --> 27:11.968
- Oh.

27:12.895 --> 27:15.825
Well, sounds nice.

27:15.825 --> 27:17.490
What about studying?

27:17.490 --> 27:19.775
- Mm, like sitting in a room,
listening to someone all day?

27:19.775 --> 27:21.575
Nah. Get bored.

27:21.575 --> 27:23.675
- Well you could get a job outside.

27:23.675 --> 27:25.733
Like on a farm. Then
you'll never be inside.

27:25.733 --> 27:26.745
- No, I like the city too much.

27:26.745 --> 27:28.945
Like I love noise, people, bars.

27:28.945 --> 27:30.115
- Then work at a bar.

27:30.115 --> 27:31.508
- I don't think that's a good idea.

27:33.555 --> 27:35.275
- Do you think you drink too much, or?

27:35.275 --> 27:37.885
- Well, I tried to quit alcohol

27:37.885 --> 27:40.145
and then I found a job as a barmaid

27:40.145 --> 27:42.065
and I really thought I was,
you know, strong enough

27:42.065 --> 27:44.115
but it didn't work out.

27:44.115 --> 27:45.608
- [Carol] Oh. The job?

27:46.595 --> 27:47.545
- No, the quitting.

27:49.285 --> 27:51.025
- You could get a job in a restaurant.

27:51.025 --> 27:52.955
That'd be perfect because
it's nice and social

27:52.955 --> 27:53.945
and the pay is not too bad.

27:53.945 --> 27:55.705
- I know. You just sound like my mum.

27:55.705 --> 27:58.245
- Fuck you, Margot, I'm
only trying to help.

27:58.245 --> 28:01.815
You can't just come into my
life without any kind of plan.

28:01.815 --> 28:03.785
Do you even have any money?

28:03.785 --> 28:05.385
How long are you gonna stay for?

28:07.085 --> 28:08.608
It's complicated enough, you know.

28:08.608 --> 28:09.558
- What do you mean?

28:10.995 --> 28:11.828
- Nothing.

28:13.085 --> 28:14.835
- Well, I'm happy to see you.

28:14.835 --> 28:16.432
That's my plan for now.

28:19.675 --> 28:23.818
I just need some sun and
happiness to grow, like a flower.

28:25.845 --> 28:26.745
- Here's the plan,

28:27.885 --> 28:30.185
you're allowed to stay here for one month.

28:30.185 --> 28:32.055
One month exactly.

28:32.055 --> 28:34.225
And as soon as that one month is up,

28:34.225 --> 28:35.875
you are moving back to your old life

28:35.875 --> 28:38.545
and you're going to make
us all proud of you.

28:38.545 --> 28:39.515
Deal?

28:39.515 --> 28:40.348
- [Margot] Deal.

28:41.815 --> 28:43.175
- Deal.

28:43.175 --> 28:44.075
Is that your plan?

28:44.955 --> 28:46.517
You're not gonna build a meth lab?

28:46.517 --> 28:47.515
- Shut up, Chad.

28:47.515 --> 28:49.218
- Shut up.

28:49.218 --> 28:52.205
[Chad sighs]

28:52.205 --> 28:53.335
- Oh God, I've got to go.

28:53.335 --> 28:54.734
I can't be late with those sharks at work

28:54.734 --> 28:56.075
trying to get me fired.

28:56.075 --> 28:57.075
- Wait, wait. I'm going to come with you.

28:57.075 --> 28:58.395
- Okay, well, hurry up.

28:58.395 --> 28:59.445
- Where are we going?

29:00.485 --> 29:02.908
- Don't know, but I'm
going to walk and think.

29:03.915 --> 29:05.622
- [Carol] We leave in five.

29:05.622 --> 29:07.122
- [Margot] Coming!

31:10.695 --> 31:11.528
- Hey Margot.

31:13.701 --> 31:15.445
Look, you need to give me a ring back.

31:15.445 --> 31:17.335
I need to speak to you urgently. Come on.

31:17.335 --> 31:20.365
Now please give me a ring and
I'll speak to you soon, okay?

31:20.365 --> 31:21.198
Thank you.

[women speaking in foreign language]

31:30.545 --> 31:31.715
Where's Margot?

31:31.715 --> 31:33.435
- Um, I think she just slept over.

31:33.435 --> 31:34.995
She was in a party last night, isn't it?

31:34.995 --> 31:35.828
- Mm-hm.

31:35.828 --> 31:36.661
- Come on girls.

like, are you all right?

31:39.825 --> 31:40.945
You look upset.

31:40.945 --> 31:42.915
- Margot's not paid her rent, okay?

31:42.915 --> 31:43.925
I really need to find her.

31:43.925 --> 31:45.185
Now tell me where Margot is, please.

31:45.185 --> 31:47.015
- If we knew, we would
tell you. Just calm down.

31:47.015 --> 31:48.815
- For fuck's sake, where's Margot?

31:48.815 --> 31:49.825
- We have no fucking clue.

31:49.825 --> 31:51.664
We haven't seen her.
- Fucking relax.

32:15.708 --> 32:17.722
- [Gardener] I don't
use any chemicals, no.

32:25.858 --> 32:26.923
You want a drink?

32:26.923 --> 32:27.923
- [Chad] No.

32:28.855 --> 32:30.218

water, it's good for you.

actually, she's kind of scared.

1:17:55.885 --> 1:17:57.737
You know, just to take
me in for a few days.

1:17:58.723 --> 1:18:00.831
- Ooh, no, I don't think so.

1:18:00.831 --> 1:18:02.182

Of course you're welcome to come and stay.

1:18:04.905 --> 1:18:08.065
But no parties. No craziness, all right?

1:18:08.065 --> 1:18:09.630
No guys with guns.
