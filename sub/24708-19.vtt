13:23.677 --> 13:27.515
-He asked me to come down here.
-Uh, actually our request
was for Anthony to come.

13:27.515 --> 13:30.017
You need to understand
that Anthony got a lot
of personal...

13:30.017 --> 13:32.102
and racial history
with the police department,

13:32.102 --> 13:36.315
-and that makes him reluctant
to cooperate.
-We need to understand that,
huh?

13:36.315 --> 13:41.153
See, we would look at it less
Anthony cooperatin' with us and
more him protectin' civilians.

13:41.153 --> 13:43.823
-Well, believe it,
I wish you luck with that.
-Oh, thanks ever so much.

13:43.823 --> 13:48.911
SIMONE: Look, Nathan,
there was a bystander out there,
got a plate number on a car.

13:48.911 --> 13:53.707
The owner of this car, he has
a criminal associate been busted
twice for this type of stickup.

13:53.707 --> 13:57.294
-Now if we can get Anthony
to go through a photo array--
-Uh, he not gonna do that.

13:57.294 --> 14:00.631
Hey. I don't listen
to that crap you call music,

14:00.631 --> 14:03.801
but I know how
World Wide Wrestling works.

14:03.801 --> 14:07.596
Comes out, instead of
some big rap war payback,
this is just a regular stickup,

14:07.596 --> 14:09.682
you don't get to boost
your record sales.

14:09.682 --> 14:12.977
Andy, the industry's tendin'
to phase records out.

14:12.977 --> 14:16.564
This ain't about sales.
Anthony lost a uncle
in a police incident.

14:16.564 --> 14:20.109
-Oh, here we go.
-He had a lot of bad experiences
growin' up in Compton.

14:20.109 --> 14:22.903
Police kept hasslin' him
on his way to choir practice?

14:22.903 --> 14:25.364
Look, everybody have
they point of view, right?

14:25.364 --> 14:29.076
-I'm just tryin' to tell you
how it is with Anthony.
-Hey, Nathan, you know,

14:29.076 --> 14:32.162
how would Daddy Kool look
with his rap fans...

14:32.162 --> 14:35.749
if we let it out,
when this stickup happens,

14:35.749 --> 14:38.419
-he offers the perp a hand job
not to mess him up?
-Easy, Andy.

14:38.419 --> 14:41.297
-Have I been
disrespectful to you?
-SIPOWICZ: Nah, nah.

14:41.297 --> 14:44.425
Your big jerk client
handled that aspect
at the hospital.

14:44.425 --> 14:47.344
Okay. I wasn't there,
so I don't know
what got said first.

14:47.344 --> 14:49.889
I'm just here tryin' to address
the situation, that's all.

14:49.889 --> 14:50.806
Okay.

14:56.353 --> 14:58.314
(Paper Rustling)

14:58.314 --> 15:01.942
Now, I spoke to Anthony
about the incident,

15:01.942 --> 15:04.111
and this is how
he described the guy.

15:04.111 --> 15:07.740
And that...
is off the record.

15:09.617 --> 15:12.870
SIMONE:
Uh, excuse me, Nathan.
You know, I gotta tell you--

15:12.870 --> 15:16.916
and we appreciate your bein'
cooperative here, but we're
aware about Anthony's record.

15:16.916 --> 15:21.378
We don't get no specifics
on this incident, we're gonna
violate Anthony's parole.

15:24.256 --> 15:27.092
You want Anthony
to go through a bunch
of mug books?

15:27.092 --> 15:29.970
We're talkin' about
a couple photo arrays.
Should go by real fast.

15:29.970 --> 15:32.806
Big Daddy'd be in and out
in five minutes.

15:35.726 --> 15:38.437
You don't violate him
in Buffalo,

15:38.437 --> 15:41.482
and anything he gives you
is off the record.

15:41.482 --> 15:43.692
Nothing gets out
he came in.

15:43.692 --> 15:45.945
'Bout an hour and a half.

15:55.120 --> 15:57.873
With them,
that's two hours
and 15 minutes.

16:05.506 --> 16:08.217
-That Szymanski's
a piece of work.
-What's he sayin'?

16:08.217 --> 16:11.512
No statement,
won't authorize a car search.

16:11.512 --> 16:13.514
-He's gotta let you look
in his locker.
-Yeah. We did that.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.891
-Nothin' there?
-Nah.

16:15.891 --> 16:18.852
We know 95% of the time
the dealer's just lookin'
to beat the case,

16:18.852 --> 16:21.188
but a guy sets up
how Szymanski's doin'?

16:21.188 --> 16:24.775
-He's makin' himself wrong.
-And your idea he's not.

16:24.775 --> 16:29.279
-Hmm.
-You mind if I talk to him?

16:29.279 --> 16:32.533
Listenin' to him,
you're the guy
who put him in the box:

16:32.533 --> 16:35.244
transferred him,
put him with a black cop.

16:35.244 --> 16:37.454
Says he wouldn't be surprised
if you knew the dealer.

16:37.454 --> 16:41.500
-Who's the dealer?
-Some old... hype named Clive?

16:43.043 --> 16:45.295
-He's in the pokey?
-Yeah.

16:48.090 --> 16:51.385
-Szymanski's
in the pokey.
-Yeah.

17:14.241 --> 17:17.036
-Feelin' good, Lieutenant?
-Use your head,
Szymanski.

17:17.036 --> 17:21.248
You think I'd reach out
to all these different people
just to jam you up?

17:21.248 --> 17:25.627
Since the night I stopped you
for that taillight, my world's
turned upside down.

17:25.627 --> 17:30.257
So today, when I.A.B.
grabs me for whackin' up
some dealer's bankroll...

17:30.257 --> 17:33.510
when I never took
a cent in my life,

17:33.510 --> 17:35.554
I don't chalk that up
to bad luck.

17:41.685 --> 17:43.979
Have you contacted
your delegate?

17:43.979 --> 17:46.065
(Chuckles)

17:46.065 --> 17:49.693
Oh, boy.
There must be a name for this.

17:49.693 --> 17:53.655
Stop imagining
conspiracy, Szymanski,
and start saving your job.

17:53.655 --> 17:55.657
You mind steppin' out,
Lieutenant?

17:57.785 --> 18:00.037
Watch 'em screw me
through the window.

18:17.304 --> 18:21.475
-He's just about
gone psycho.
-He didn't steal that money.

18:23.143 --> 18:25.562
-You're sure on that?
-Does somethin' wrong,

18:25.562 --> 18:30.025
he has to give up thinkin'
how unfair life's treated him.

18:30.025 --> 18:33.570
I don't know if I want to be
takin' that to my bosses
without searchin' his car.

18:33.570 --> 18:37.491
-Can I talk
to the other cop?
-Wanna come work with us?

18:42.412 --> 18:43.997
(Knocks)

18:50.003 --> 18:54.758
-You give us a minute?
-Arthur Fancy,
15th Detective Squad.

18:54.758 --> 18:58.262
-Hi, Lieutenant. Louis Jones.
-(FANCY)
You holdin' up all right?

18:58.262 --> 19:01.974
Keep telling myself, I didn't
do anything, I shouldn't have
anything to worry about.

19:01.974 --> 19:03.892
You want to run
the collar for me?

19:03.892 --> 19:06.228
We're on Avenue "D"
drivin' toward Second.

19:06.228 --> 19:10.649
Narcotics has a corner up
two blocks over. We wanna push
the skells in that direction.

19:10.649 --> 19:13.819
Sees us comin',
everyone books except
this one skeevy dealer.

19:13.819 --> 19:16.655
-You know Clive's
last name?
-Bell.

19:16.655 --> 19:20.701
Szymanski took the guy
into a hallway while
I secured the vehicle.

19:20.701 --> 19:24.705
I come back, Szymanski shows me
three decks of smack and $11.

19:24.705 --> 19:28.959
So we move the skell
to the radio car.
He starts yellin' he was robbed.

19:28.959 --> 19:31.962
How soon does Bell
repeat the charge
in the house?

19:31.962 --> 19:34.339
Uh, like a half hour.

19:34.339 --> 19:39.344
Holds off sayin' it till
Szymanski would've had time
to get rid of the money.

19:39.344 --> 19:41.930
-You're sure Szymanski
didn't do it?
-You think he might have?

19:43.765 --> 19:49.062
I don't. No. But I'm not about
to put my badge up for a guy
who says I'm in on a frame.

19:49.062 --> 19:51.356
-Szymanski said that
straight out?
-Hell, yes.

19:51.356 --> 19:54.026
When the Rat Squad showed up,
said you were too.

19:57.404 --> 20:00.407
Pissed you off
on a... car stop, huh?

20:00.407 --> 20:02.951
Car stop had nothin'
to do with any of this.

20:02.951 --> 20:06.163
Only had that happen to me
about 80 or 90 times.

20:19.843 --> 20:23.138

your glasses off?

20:23.138 --> 20:25.098
Hey, check 'em out,

20:37.527 --> 20:41.740
Now, uh, you sure
you don't recognize anybody
in these arrays, huh?

20:43.533 --> 20:46.703

if you recognized anybody.

huh? You gutless scumbag.
-Boo got the car?

20:55.754 --> 20:58.382
You know, Nathan,
I don't really think this was
a good-faith effort here.

20:58.382 --> 21:00.550

him doin' what you want?

people, it's on you, Daddy Kool.
Not that you give a rat's ass.

was innocent, huh, Big Daddy?

21:12.312 --> 21:15.023

-Clive.
-Mm-hmm?

27:07.917 --> 27:10.337
If they pull back
to simple possession,

27:10.337 --> 27:12.714
will you drop
the complaint
on the cop?

27:13.798 --> 27:15.759
(Chuckles)

27:17.302 --> 27:21.598
You're so deep into knowin'
human nature, Arthur.

27:21.598 --> 27:26.186
How come that don't
make you use dope?
Hmm.

27:28.730 --> 27:30.732
(Sighs)
On the gate.

27:39.532 --> 27:43.078
Mornin'.
So you do know Clive Bell.

27:43.078 --> 27:46.539
I started thinkin' last night,
I might've known him when
I was a cop. Came in to check.

27:46.539 --> 27:48.750
-Same guy?
-Yeah.

27:48.750 --> 27:53.004
I think he wants to
withdraw his complaint
on Szymanski.

27:53.004 --> 27:55.256
Lieutenant, I come
to take this guy
to the grand jury.

27:55.256 --> 27:58.635
You're in his cell
without permission
or even notification.

27:58.635 --> 28:00.679
I think he'll tell you
the same story he told me.

28:00.679 --> 28:03.515
Yeah, 'cause if
I put it in the report
that he withdrew it to you,

28:03.515 --> 28:06.893
then I gotta do some explaining,
and then you do.

28:06.893 --> 28:09.646
Szymanski still
refusing cooperation?

28:09.646 --> 28:13.358
Yeah.
Szymanski's screwed anyway--
piss-poor attitude.

28:14.984 --> 28:17.821
Well, I want you to know,
I'm gonna talk to him.

28:19.614 --> 28:22.158
Sometime when we both
have a few days,

28:22.158 --> 28:25.036
I'd love to find out
what the hell
this is about.

28:29.165 --> 28:32.961
Two collars here, Jermaine,
and a whole pile of evidence
lookin' you in the face.

28:32.961 --> 28:34.963
-Lawyer.
-Oh, that's how you want
to travel, huh?

28:34.963 --> 28:37.340
You were picked out
by the victim and an eyewitness.

28:37.340 --> 28:39.592
Ballistics matched
with your gun.

28:39.592 --> 28:44.055
-Ain't got your lab
open this early.
-That's a good point.

28:44.055 --> 28:48.560
All we're sayin' here, Jermaine,
cooperate before the evidence
has you in a corner.

28:48.560 --> 28:51.855
-That's when
we give it the weight.
-Lawyer.

28:53.231 --> 28:55.692
Crow Taylor, huh?

28:55.692 --> 28:59.279
-Is that "crow"
like the, uh, bird?
-Hey, that's it.

28:59.279 --> 29:02.991
Ask him questions in chirps.

29:02.991 --> 29:05.535
So, uh, you been rentin'
your car out for stickups
there, huh, Crow?

29:05.535 --> 29:08.413
-(Mumbles) I don't know.
-We got your vehicle's
got no signs of bein'...

29:08.413 --> 29:11.708
broken into, has been
I.D.'d by victims in
three separate incidents.

29:11.708 --> 29:16.337
Hmm. Hmm. You know, maybe
somebody made duplicates, or--

29:16.337 --> 29:19.799
plus--plus I lost
a spare set of keys?

29:19.799 --> 29:22.051
Somebody--
Somebody might be usin' that.

29:22.051 --> 29:26.264
Well, the only problem there is,
your man Jermaine's been
picked out for the stickups.

29:26.264 --> 29:29.601
He told us that
you rented him the car
for a hundred and fifty a night,

29:29.601 --> 29:31.936
and you knew what
he was usin' it for.

29:31.936 --> 29:33.730
Right?

29:37.317 --> 29:40.195
(Slaps Table)
Stick with the dumb act, Crow,

29:40.195 --> 29:43.114
you will do
the 15 Jermaine does.

29:43.114 --> 29:45.950
You explain your part here,
you're lookin' at 18 months.

29:50.663 --> 29:54.584
Never paid me no 150.
Paid a hundred a night.

30:03.343 --> 30:05.929
(Knocks)

30:05.929 --> 30:08.890
-What do you want?
-Why don't you come in
and shut the door.

30:13.686 --> 30:17.565
I think that dealer's
withdrawing his allegation
about you taking his money.

30:17.565 --> 30:19.818
That's good,
'cause I didn't take it.

30:19.818 --> 30:22.904
-You're wrong if you think
that ends it, Szymanski.
-No.

30:22.904 --> 30:27.283
I'm sure you've got more strings
to pull. I'll just try to keep
lookin' over both shoulders.

30:27.283 --> 30:30.578
Well, you may not be doing
that on the job if you don't
get straight with I.A.B.

30:30.578 --> 30:34.332
(Scoffs)
Those charges are wrong, and
you just said they're dropped.

30:34.332 --> 30:37.418
-And you refused a statement.
-Fifth Amendment's
only for perps?

30:37.418 --> 30:41.214
You know 15-A
exposes you to discipline.

30:41.214 --> 30:46.094
I'm finally gettin' what
this is about. You look bad
to I.A.B. off harassin' me.

30:46.094 --> 30:49.347
Use this leverage here
to make me tell them
what a great guy you are.

30:49.347 --> 30:52.225
And you know
what else, Szymanski?
I helped kill Kennedy.

30:52.225 --> 30:56.187
-And I helped kill
Martin Luther King.
-Hey. Hey. Hey. Look, look.

30:56.187 --> 30:58.147
That wasn't about race.

30:58.147 --> 31:01.067
-I'm tryin' to
get you to see--
-It's all about race,
Lieutenant.

31:01.067 --> 31:03.444
Then let's start there.

31:03.444 --> 31:07.532
Admit part of why you
broke balls at that traffic stop
was 'cause I'm black,

31:07.532 --> 31:10.034
and I'll admit
that part of why I tried
to get you transferred...

31:10.034 --> 31:13.037
to a black precinct was
'cause that pissed me off.

31:13.037 --> 31:15.290
You make it sound like
that's the end of what you did.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.208
Well, it's gotta end
somewhere, Szymanski.

31:18.835 --> 31:21.796
Now when I got your transfer
rerouted to this precinct,

31:21.796 --> 31:25.383
-I told myself,
we start with a clean slate.
-Oh, it wasn't like,

31:25.383 --> 31:29.804
"Let this Szymanski
see me every day and know
he's under my thumb."

31:29.804 --> 31:32.891
Look, I'm the boss
of a detective squad,
not uniform cops.

31:35.518 --> 31:38.438
Maybe... what you say
has some truth in it.

31:38.438 --> 31:41.941
I don't understand
everything that's
in my heart,

31:41.941 --> 31:44.694
but I promise you,
what went down
with that dealer,

31:44.694 --> 31:48.239
it had nothin' to do
with him or your new partner
bein' black.

31:48.239 --> 31:50.825
And it had nothing
to do with me,

31:50.825 --> 31:54.037
even though it turns out
I did know that dealer
a long time ago.

31:54.037 --> 31:57.040
Is that right?

31:57.040 --> 31:59.375
Szymanski,

31:59.375 --> 32:04.088
mistrusting everyone,
it only cuts you off.

32:04.088 --> 32:06.507
Now I'm not
putting I.A.B. up as
great people to trust,

32:06.507 --> 32:09.218
but that's
the situation you're in.

32:09.218 --> 32:12.847
You're innocent.
Tell them that.

32:23.316 --> 32:27.737
You weren't wrong
about that car stop.
Not a hundred percent.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.240
Let's put that behind us.

32:35.662 --> 32:40.166
Guy's been asking
for the statements,
uh, Sergeant Martens--

32:40.166 --> 32:41.960
He's who I'd reach out to.

32:43.836 --> 32:46.798
-All right.
-All right.

33:00.728 --> 33:04.148
♪

33:06.484 --> 33:09.320
SIPOWICZ:
I better not say
nothin' in there.

33:09.320 --> 33:12.281
Uh--Yeah, well,
hang back if you want.
(Yawns)

33:12.281 --> 33:14.534
Half-punchy,
zero tolerance--

33:14.534 --> 33:18.121
They're liable to
ask me what time it is,
I'll hit 'em with a board.

33:21.124 --> 33:23.167
SIMONE:
Appreciate you
comin' back, Anthony.

33:23.167 --> 33:26.754
No, no. We're here off
you lyin', saying you wasn't
callin' his probation upstate.

33:26.754 --> 33:29.298
Man, you dumb enough
to act surprised.

33:29.298 --> 33:31.300
SIMONE:
Hey, we got a leg up
on makin' this case.

33:31.300 --> 33:33.553
The only way
we can pressure this guy
is off a victim's I.D.

33:33.553 --> 33:37.807
I'm sorry, but that's
the way it lays out.
We are gonna do our jobs here.

33:37.807 --> 33:40.184
-(Switch Clicks)
-What's that about?

33:40.184 --> 33:42.687
Oh, I'm doin' my job--
prove he cooperated.

33:42.687 --> 33:46.149
I want you to say he's lookin'
at them pictures, and then
we gettin' the hell outta here.

33:46.149 --> 33:49.110
Show me the pictures.

33:49.110 --> 33:51.487
(Laughs)

33:53.573 --> 33:56.242
Hang on a second.

34:01.205 --> 34:03.666
I want you to realize
that Detective Sipowicz...

34:03.666 --> 34:06.252
is hangin' back
on this interview, which he's
doin' at his own request.

34:06.252 --> 34:09.005
-Tell him
to show me the pictures.
-Detective Sipowicz...

34:09.005 --> 34:11.841
recognizes some antagonism
between him and Anthony.

34:11.841 --> 34:14.886
Don't want it to impede
gettin' this perpetrator
off the street.

34:14.886 --> 34:17.722
Game.

34:17.722 --> 34:22.894
What he said to me, Anthony--
"Same how this kid
had bad experiences--

34:22.894 --> 34:24.896
"his uncle's death
and so forth--

34:24.896 --> 34:26.981
"I had similar experiences
growin' up:

34:26.981 --> 34:30.610
"beat up in the projects,
my father lost his eye.

34:30.610 --> 34:33.988
"I don't want my bad
experience--if that would
affect me unintentionally--

34:33.988 --> 34:37.784
I wouldn't want that
jeopardizing if this rap star
is willing to cooperate."

34:41.704 --> 34:43.498
Told you that, huh?

34:45.333 --> 34:47.418
Hmm.

34:47.418 --> 34:49.837
Every one of these stickup's
been black-on-black.

34:49.837 --> 34:52.256
-Meaning what?
-(Sighs)

34:52.256 --> 34:55.718
Whatever that
Tupac Shakur, uh,

34:55.718 --> 35:01.099
"Conspicuous" B.I.G.
difficulty was about,
this isn't like that.

35:01.099 --> 35:06.312
Anthony, we got a punk out there
with a gun on the street who's
takin' his own people off.

35:06.312 --> 35:10.316
Plus, this one--
right now, his officer's
just been notified.

35:10.316 --> 35:13.236
He don't cooperate,
his probation gets revoked,

35:17.573 --> 35:22.995
which... I don't say
directly, knowin' that I--
I should stay removed.

35:24.914 --> 35:28.376
We acknowledge that
Anthony is cooperating.

35:28.376 --> 35:30.920
We believe that, given
Anthony's cooperation,

35:30.920 --> 35:34.507
his probation should be
reduced to time served.

35:41.139 --> 35:43.057
Check the tape recorder
was on.

35:45.434 --> 35:48.062
(Switch Clicks)

35:52.984 --> 35:54.527
Show me the pictures.

36:13.504 --> 36:16.507
-Number four
in the second array.
-Yeah.

36:20.344 --> 36:22.930
We'd like you to
take a look at a lineup.

36:28.227 --> 36:29.979
(Chuckles)

36:37.028 --> 36:38.821
(Knocking)

36:58.758 --> 37:01.344
You indicated
you recognize number three.

37:01.344 --> 37:04.472
Where do you recognize
number three from, Anthony?

37:09.227 --> 37:11.187
Outside the Ibex.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.816
All but number three can go.

37:22.782 --> 37:24.116
"K."

37:26.285 --> 37:29.538
You out of a job?
About five times a month.

37:29.538 --> 37:32.124
Anthony about somethin',
whatever your cracker partner
might think.

37:32.124 --> 37:35.044
So's my cracker partner.

37:35.044 --> 37:40.633
(Chuckles)
You know, me and Anthony, we've
been down since we 10 years old.

37:40.633 --> 37:43.010
And him dealin' with this gonna
be the first night in a while,

37:43.010 --> 37:45.263
I don't go to bed knowin' some
mornin' I find out he's dead.

37:51.143 --> 37:54.522
-So long, man.
-Yeah. So long.

38:10.788 --> 38:12.832
Bobby?

38:17.753 --> 38:21.590
-What's up?
-Special Agent Kriegel,
Special Agent Kazmaier.

38:21.590 --> 38:24.093
-How's it goin'?
-Good to meet ya.

38:26.387 --> 38:30.975
-They wanna talk to me?
-Actually, I--I saw you
the other night at Hugo's.

38:30.975 --> 38:35.187
-Yeah, huh?
-Agent Kriegel was
with Joey Salvo.

38:35.187 --> 38:38.858
Yeah, he, uh--
he stopped over to say hello.

38:38.858 --> 38:41.610
Yeah, you were at dinner
with, uh, Detective Russell.

38:43.821 --> 38:46.240
-You've known Salvo
some time.
-Yeah.

38:46.240 --> 38:50.161
We've had him up
for five months.
He's a pretty careful guy.

38:50.161 --> 38:53.331
Not careful enough
that he didn't have dinner
with an F.B.I. agent.

38:53.331 --> 38:56.709
Enough he's given me
small stuff that's good,
and nothin' good that counts.

38:59.045 --> 39:01.839
So, what--you think he, uh,
has you made?

39:03.841 --> 39:07.845
We'd like you
to run into him again.
See what comes of that.

39:07.845 --> 39:11.640
Get him to test you
with a small favor. See how
he moves when you do it.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.560
What's a small favor--
wheelman while he robs a bank?

39:14.560 --> 39:18.189
If you think he's gonna ask
that from you first, you're not
the smart cop everyone says.

39:22.193 --> 39:24.195
Gotta talk to my boss.

39:24.195 --> 39:26.572
You mean Detective Russell?
(Chuckles)

39:26.572 --> 39:30.743
-(Chuckles)
-Would you excuse us?

39:33.954 --> 39:36.248
Absolutely.

39:39.543 --> 39:44.215
Uh, what it's worth,
your chief of detectives
thinks it's a great idea.

39:49.470 --> 39:53.766
Meaning what, huh? Meaning what
from this smart-mouthed prick--

39:53.766 --> 39:56.936
I-I don't do this,
so he transfers me or Diane?

39:56.936 --> 39:59.313
-You'd never pin him down
he meant that.
-Lieu, there's a whole...

39:59.313 --> 40:02.817
-lotta reasons why I wouldn't
be that happy doin' this.
-Tell him no.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.487
You heard from
chief of D's?

40:06.487 --> 40:09.156
You don't want to do it,
I can handle the chief.

40:13.994 --> 40:17.331
-I gotta think about it.
-Absolutely.

40:33.931 --> 40:35.933
Hey, Greg.

40:35.933 --> 40:38.269
Hi, Abby.

40:38.269 --> 40:42.064
Um, I'm here
with my decision
on this entire matter.

40:42.064 --> 40:45.609
You know, some ways I feel
like I've really imposed
on you with all this, Greg.

40:45.609 --> 40:48.821
Not at all.
What's more momentous than--
th-than wanting a child?

40:48.821 --> 40:52.408
Well, anyway,
it's a little late to apologize.

40:53.742 --> 40:58.747
Abby, I'll be happy
to give my sperm
to you and Kathy.

40:58.747 --> 41:00.749
Uh, naturally, I--
I have some questions,

41:00.749 --> 41:02.960
uh, about the context.

41:02.960 --> 41:07.006
I-I-I mean, uh, I certainly,
uh, am aware that, uh,

41:07.006 --> 41:09.633
i-i-it's an artificial process.

41:09.633 --> 41:14.138
We find out when I start
ovulating. You ejaculate into
a sample jar whenever you can.

41:14.138 --> 41:18.142
I see. I see. Um, and--
and--and the interval,
uh, between, uh,

41:18.142 --> 41:22.438
finding out your state
of affairs and--and my activity
I'm supposed to perform...

41:22.438 --> 41:25.691
and then makin' that available
to you--what--what's
the entire interval there?

41:25.691 --> 41:30.654
-It all has to happen
in an hour and a half.
-Ninety minutes.

41:30.654 --> 41:35.326
Greg--
but you can do your part
in any men's room,

41:35.326 --> 41:38.954
-and Kathy can be available
to deliver it, or I--
-Fine. Fine.

41:38.954 --> 41:44.210
Uh, we'll, uh,
work out the gist--uh, any
performance anxiety, so forth.

41:44.210 --> 41:46.921
-Do you wanna sit down?
-No. No, thank you.

41:52.593 --> 41:54.303
(Kisses)

42:19.036 --> 42:20.412
Hey.

42:22.498 --> 42:26.377
Hmm.
Twenty minutes
of foreplay wasted?

42:37.263 --> 42:41.141
Wait, wait,
wait, wait. Let's--
Let's get there legit.

42:45.563 --> 42:47.398
This Joey Salvo you met
at dinner the other night--

42:47.398 --> 42:50.150
-Stickup guy?
-Alleged.

42:50.150 --> 42:53.445
F.B.I.'s had him up for, like,
five months. They want me
to get involved with him.

42:53.445 --> 42:56.657
-Were you
and Salvo tight?
-Nah. I was into my birds.

42:56.657 --> 43:01.870
This guy was already half
an Ali Baba. He went away
when he was, like, 16.

43:01.870 --> 43:03.956
I saw him
in this fistfight once.

43:03.956 --> 43:06.333
I mean, Joey was always kinda,
like, built up, you know.

43:06.333 --> 43:08.836
There was this kid,
Timmy Flynn, who was thin,
but tough kid.

43:08.836 --> 43:10.796
These two guys,
they're goin' at it
for, like, 10 minutes...

43:10.796 --> 43:15.593
before the gym teacher comes
and breaks it up.
(Scoffs)

43:15.593 --> 43:18.971
And that was the first
I saw Joey in a fight
and not walk away a winner.

43:18.971 --> 43:23.267
So that night, somebody
caves Timmy's head in
with a ball bat.

43:23.267 --> 43:27.563
-Killed him?
-No, he lived
for, like, six months.

43:27.563 --> 43:30.316
-(Quietly)
Oh.
-Couldn't--Couldn't talk.

43:32.651 --> 43:35.195
They, uh--
(Chuckles)

43:35.195 --> 43:38.907
They used to sit him in the park
in his wheelchair.

43:38.907 --> 43:42.202
Half the days
he'd have seizures.

43:42.202 --> 43:47.499
Joey, he would, uh, always,
you know, crouch next to him,
ask him, "How ya doin'?"

43:50.628 --> 43:55.507
-He's a real bad guy.
-That's a tough guy
to work.

43:55.507 --> 43:59.720
Hey, if I do him some
small solid, they just wanna
see how he's gonna pick up.

44:04.683 --> 44:06.268
Come here.

44:15.319 --> 44:17.821
What was it
that we were doin' there
in the bathroom?

44:23.327 --> 44:25.704
If you don't want
to do it, Bobby,
don't do it.

44:25.704 --> 44:28.582
Oh, baby,
there's nothin'
I wanna do more.
