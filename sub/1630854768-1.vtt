(carnival music playing)

00:04.672 --> 00:06.964
(all shouting)

00:07.900 --> 00:09.174
Alright.

00:10.252 --> 00:11.326
I don't think
they're gonna let me

00:11.328 --> 00:13.345
on the bumper cars
with this bear.

00:13.347 --> 00:16.073
No problem. We'll hit
the fried cheese guy instead.

00:16.075 --> 00:17.407
Cheese?

00:17.409 --> 00:20.019
Caleb, you already
had fried soup.

00:20.021 --> 00:22.003
I didn't even know
that was possible.

00:22.005 --> 00:23.439
These dudes can fry anything.

00:25.192 --> 00:27.359
So, what are you
gonna name him?

00:28.029 --> 00:30.320
Oh. Uh... Bear?

00:31.423 --> 00:33.106
-You think he sucks.
-BRIANNA: No.

00:33.108 --> 00:35.259
I just don't know
why you would spend $80

00:35.261 --> 00:36.426
trying to win this thing.

00:36.428 --> 00:38.762
Because it's not
about the money, Bri.

00:38.764 --> 00:40.764
It's about showing you
that I'll fight for you.

00:40.766 --> 00:44.117
Look, your family
keeps calling me a loser.

00:44.119 --> 00:46.861
Well, I just proved them wrong
by spending 80 bucks

00:46.863 --> 00:48.505
to win you that $10 bear.

00:49.124 --> 00:50.457
I guess you did.

00:50.459 --> 00:53.510
The point is,
I'm in it for the long haul.

00:54.963 --> 00:56.305
I'm not going anywhere.

00:59.802 --> 01:01.042
That actually means a lot.

01:01.136 --> 01:04.063
Um, 'cause I've been
thinking about our future--

01:04.065 --> 01:05.380
(winces)
I gotta go.

01:05.382 --> 01:08.141
-Caleb.
-I think it was the fried soup.

01:08.143 --> 01:10.127
Told you not to eat that!

01:10.129 --> 01:12.237

03:02.850 --> 03:04.074
Showers coming.

03:04.167 --> 03:06.092
Yeah, B-shift already
prepped the rain gear.

03:06.094 --> 03:07.260
Yeah, slam some migas, Marj.

03:07.262 --> 03:09.504
We got cheese,
pico de gallo, what else?

03:09.506 --> 03:11.097
-Olives.
-Veto.

03:11.099 --> 03:12.265
Olives ruin everything.

03:12.267 --> 03:13.934
-What?
-Veto Override.

03:13.936 --> 03:16.420
Black olives
are a Tex-Mex staple.

03:16.422 --> 03:18.513
Hey, TK,
important migas question.

03:18.515 --> 03:19.589
-Are they paleo?
-Nah, man.

03:19.700 --> 03:21.775
That's not the question
I was gonna ask, bro.

03:21.777 --> 03:24.036
TK, your wedding bod
is on point.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.854
You can eat a carb.

03:26.856 --> 03:28.448
-Oh, he's cranky.
-(chuckles)

03:28.450 --> 03:29.950
MATEO CHAVEZ:
Bro, what's going on?

03:29.952 --> 03:31.618
Carlos and I toured
a wedding venue.

03:31.620 --> 03:32.860
-Another?
-Yeah.

03:32.862 --> 03:33.861
How many is that?

03:33.863 --> 03:35.121
Fourteen.

03:35.123 --> 03:36.864
This one's
just outside of town.

03:36.866 --> 03:39.626
Seats 150,
wildflowers everywhere.

03:39.628 --> 03:40.868
And it's in our budget.

03:40.870 --> 03:41.962
It sounds perfect, man.

03:41.964 --> 03:42.888
TK STRAND:
It is perfect.

03:42.890 --> 03:44.297
So what's the problem?

03:44.299 --> 03:46.892
Every other couple
in Austin thinks so, too.

03:46.894 --> 03:48.543
So now there's
an 18-month waitlist.

03:48.545 --> 03:50.545
Whoa, that's almost like
a year and a half away.

03:50.547 --> 03:53.214
Babe, that's exactly
a year and a half away.

03:53.216 --> 03:55.216
-So I was right, babe.
-Inadvertently.

03:55.218 --> 03:57.602
TK:
So we have to settle
for something less perfect

03:57.604 --> 03:58.886
or we wait for 18 months.

03:59.073 --> 04:01.298
You're talking to a woman
who was engaged for 13 years.

04:01.300 --> 04:02.983
And we see how well
that turned out, huh?

04:02.985 --> 04:04.134
Okay.

04:04.136 --> 04:06.078
-JUDD RYDER: Damn thing.
-Hey, Judd.

04:06.080 --> 04:07.971
Where did you
and Grace get married?

04:07.973 --> 04:09.823
My Uncle Cash's ranch.

04:09.825 --> 04:11.141
Does he rent it out?

04:11.143 --> 04:12.826
No, they got all these
loose hogs out there,

04:12.828 --> 04:14.920
it'd be
an insurance nightmare.

04:14.922 --> 04:16.738
-(thuds)
-Whoa!

04:16.740 --> 04:18.148
This thing's
a piece of trash.

04:18.150 --> 04:19.424
Hey, hey, man, gentle
with the steam wand.

04:19.426 --> 04:21.743
No, it ain't the steam wand,
it's the filter bucket.

04:21.745 --> 04:22.928
Here, I got you, brother.

04:22.930 --> 04:24.412
So I guess
everyone is cranky today.

04:24.414 --> 04:25.430
JUDD:
Yeah, I'm cranky.

04:25.582 --> 04:27.324
Y'all ever heard of
the bare bottom method?

04:27.326 --> 04:29.159
That sounds like
an HR violation.

04:29.161 --> 04:31.661
Potty training.
What day are you on?

04:31.663 --> 04:33.755
(exhales)
Seven.

04:33.757 --> 04:35.423
I would be cranky, too.

04:35.425 --> 04:37.759
That drive to work didn't help
with the crankiness neither.

04:37.761 --> 04:38.926
Y'all try to take 35?

04:38.928 --> 04:40.261
-Oh, yeah.
-Oh, yeah. Total cluster.

04:40.263 --> 04:43.097
Yeah. So I went over
on the, uh, side streets.

04:43.099 --> 04:45.433
Some jackass on a motorcycle
pulls up on me,

04:45.435 --> 04:47.193
starts trying to
goad me into racin'.

04:47.195 --> 04:48.787
I ended up
with my coffee in my lap.

04:48.789 --> 04:50.013
-Ooh.
-MATEO: Oh, man.

04:50.015 --> 04:51.540
(motorcycle engine revving)

04:52.701 --> 04:54.126
Is that him?

04:54.353 --> 04:56.628
JUDD:
That son of a bitch must
have followed me up here.

04:56.630 --> 04:58.021
TK: Oh wow.

04:58.023 --> 05:00.299
(whistles) Hey, buddy.

05:03.244 --> 05:04.194
MARJAN MARWANI:
No way.

05:04.196 --> 05:06.196
You gotta be kiddin' me.

05:06.198 --> 05:08.198
Yeah, the, uh, weatherman
said drizzle,

05:08.200 --> 05:10.792
so I parked my baby inside.

05:10.794 --> 05:12.886
You bought a crotch rocket, Cap?

05:12.888 --> 05:14.796
This isn't a crotch rocket.

05:14.798 --> 05:16.873
This is a classic cruising bike.

05:16.875 --> 05:17.965
I mean, look at those lines.

05:17.967 --> 05:20.377
This design speaks
to heritage, traditions.

05:20.379 --> 05:22.379
It's a connection to the past.

05:22.381 --> 05:23.213
Not yours.

05:23.324 --> 05:24.548
Is that what
the salesman told you?

05:24.658 --> 05:26.883
That is actually what
my ridin' buddy Red said.

05:26.885 --> 05:27.826
Oh, "Red said."

05:27.828 --> 05:29.719
You got a ridin' buddy now?

05:29.721 --> 05:30.662
Several of 'em, actually.

05:30.664 --> 05:32.389
Yeah, we met at a stoplight,

05:32.391 --> 05:34.166
you know,
just chopping it up and, uh--

05:34.168 --> 05:35.241
I mean, that's the thing.

05:35.243 --> 05:37.561
It's not just
the freedom of the road.

05:37.563 --> 05:38.895
It's the fellowship.

05:38.897 --> 05:41.064
Hey, it's hard to explain
if you haven't lived it.

05:41.066 --> 05:42.732
And how long have you had this?

05:42.734 --> 05:44.234
Since Thursday.

05:44.236 --> 05:46.828
This bike is an expression
of me living my best life.

05:46.830 --> 05:47.921
Well, cheers to that.

05:47.923 --> 05:49.406
OWEN STRAND:
And I invite you all to join me.

05:49.408 --> 05:51.408
Embrace the good.
Just don't touch the bike.

05:51.410 --> 05:53.076
-Wait, can I just
sit on it, Cap?
-OWEN: No.

05:53.078 --> 05:54.353
Sitting is touching.

05:56.673 --> 05:57.689
NANCY GILLIAN: Um...

05:59.418 --> 06:00.692
You, uh,

06:00.694 --> 06:01.434
you think your daddy's okay?

06:01.436 --> 06:02.919
(TK clicks tongue)

06:02.938 --> 06:06.698
Yeah. Just as long as he doesn't
wear leather to the wedding.

06:06.700 --> 06:09.701

06:09.703 --> 06:11.203
ANDREA REYES:
Ay, Carlitos.

06:11.205 --> 06:14.264
Why wait for some
magazine cover venue?

06:14.266 --> 06:16.116
You two are
pretty enough as it is.

06:16.118 --> 06:18.785
<i> Si, mama, pero</i> I'd rather
not have my future husband

06:18.787 --> 06:20.194
moping on the day.

06:20.196 --> 06:21.955
He fell in love
with the place, Ma.

06:21.957 --> 06:24.031
I thought
he fell in love with you.

06:24.033 --> 06:25.942
(chuckles) Fine.

06:25.944 --> 06:28.035
-At least it gives us
lots of time to plan.

-ANDREA: No, go ahead.

06:44.053 --> 06:47.364
No, no, no, no.

06:57.643 --> 06:59.993
That was the dream venue.

A couple from Fort Worth

07:01.830 --> 07:03.338
which means
they have an opening.

07:03.999 --> 07:05.590

07:16.770 --> 07:18.603
You're not worried
about the cake?

07:18.605 --> 07:19.688
No.

07:21.016 --> 07:24.000
You haven't told TK the truth?

07:24.002 --> 07:26.002
-Carlitos.
-Look, I was going to.

07:26.004 --> 07:27.612
Okay? I thought I had more--

07:27.614 --> 07:29.531
You need to tell him today.

07:31.618 --> 07:35.162
Yes. I-I guess I'm gonna

08:31.920 --> 08:33.553
<i> He has a frog in his throat.</i>

-(horn blares)

08:48.937 --> 08:50.603
(croaks)

08:50.605 --> 08:53.031
Anybody ever seen
anything like this?

08:53.033 --> 08:54.424
Yeah. The book of Exodus.

08:54.426 --> 08:56.368
It happens.
Waterspout hits the right pond,

08:56.370 --> 08:59.262
sucks up the frogs
and whatever into the clouds.

08:59.264 --> 08:59.929
Oh, yeah. Like<i> Sharknado.</i>

08:59.931 --> 09:01.431
Exactly like<i> Sharknado.</i>

09:01.433 --> 09:04.876
OWEN:
Alright. Judd and Mateo--
Halligans, backboard.

09:04.878 --> 09:06.527
Paul, Marjan,
make yourself helpful.

09:06.529 --> 09:08.338
-PAUL STRICKLAND: You got it.
-MARJAN: Yep.

09:11.777 --> 09:12.959
MELODY:
Help! Over here!

09:12.961 --> 09:14.678
You guys need to help my dad.

09:16.798 --> 09:18.557
He's choking to death.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.641
Take us to him.

09:21.119 --> 09:22.227
A frog dropped down his throat.

09:22.229 --> 09:24.637
I tried to get it out,
but I couldn't.

09:24.639 --> 09:25.897
Sir.

09:25.899 --> 09:27.140
Okay, I need you to relax.

09:27.142 --> 09:28.975
Okay, we're gonna
check you out.

09:28.977 --> 09:30.235
Alright. Okay.

09:31.813 --> 09:33.446
Just try to relax.

09:34.908 --> 09:36.299
-Just relax. Hm.
-(frog croaking)

09:36.301 --> 09:37.909
Yeah, that's a frog, alright.

09:37.911 --> 09:39.969
Nancy, McGill clamp.

09:39.971 --> 09:41.228
-Copy.
-It's alright.

09:41.230 --> 09:42.581
We're gonna handle this.

09:42.583 --> 09:43.665
-NANCY: McGill.
-Okay.

09:45.401 --> 09:46.251
Up.

09:46.828 --> 09:48.828
Ah...

09:48.830 --> 09:49.754
(frog croaks)

09:51.333 --> 09:53.675
OWEN:
Excuse me, step back.
Thank you.

09:55.095 --> 09:56.720
Ma'am, can you hear me?

09:57.489 --> 09:58.321
How many?

09:58.323 --> 09:59.914
We don't need tickets, ma'am.

09:59.916 --> 10:00.932
TICKET AGENT:
Oh, of course you don't.

10:00.934 --> 10:03.509
First responders get in free.

10:03.511 --> 10:04.510
Really?

10:04.754 --> 10:05.937
Can we just get her
out of there, please?

10:05.939 --> 10:07.831
Oh, yeah, sorry, Cap.

10:07.833 --> 10:08.940
Slippery little sucker.

10:08.942 --> 10:10.834
(frog croaks)

10:10.836 --> 10:11.943
Gonna need the camera.

10:11.945 --> 10:12.944
Copy.

10:12.946 --> 10:14.095
(gags)

10:14.097 --> 10:15.763
Uh, it slipped down further.

10:15.765 --> 10:16.781
His pulse is dropping down, Cap.

10:16.783 --> 10:18.099
Forget the camera. No time.

10:18.101 --> 10:19.175
Help me get him up.

10:19.177 --> 10:20.026
TK:
Are we gonna lay him down?

10:20.028 --> 10:22.662
No. Heimlich.
Okay. Alright.

10:23.531 --> 10:25.457
(grunting)

10:28.662 --> 10:29.628
(croaks)

10:29.630 --> 10:30.462
(sighs)

10:30.464 --> 10:31.630
Dad!

10:32.949 --> 10:34.115
Alright, sir.

10:34.117 --> 10:36.042
I need you to breathe
for me, okay?

10:36.044 --> 10:37.710
You're gonna be just fine.

10:37.712 --> 10:38.678
Thank you.

10:45.053 --> 10:45.977
(car alarm beeping)

10:45.979 --> 10:47.479
Hey, tell me that's not hail.

10:48.798 --> 10:50.464
-(glass shatters)
-Nope. That's gorilla hail.

10:50.466 --> 10:52.225
-Hey! Everybody, take cover!
-Everybody, take cover!

10:52.227 --> 10:54.560
-PAUL: Hey! Take cover!
-MARJAN: Everybody, come on!

10:54.562 --> 10:55.654
(hail thudding)

10:58.325 --> 11:00.474
OWEN:
Alright, alright, new plan.

11:00.476 --> 11:00.992
Make a shield.

11:00.994 --> 11:03.244
(hail thudding)

11:04.723 --> 11:06.539
(car alarms beeping)

11:08.393 --> 11:11.711
Um, we need to
close the doors now.

11:15.158 --> 11:17.158
At least it can't
get any worse.

11:17.160 --> 11:19.235
It can always
get worse, Chavez.

11:19.237 --> 11:21.221
This thing's
just getting started.

11:23.499 --> 11:24.757
(birds chirping)

11:24.759 --> 11:25.725
Huh!

11:30.081 --> 11:32.023
Isn't it pretty?

11:32.025 --> 11:35.402
Anybody else feel like
the calm's on the wrong side
of this storm?

11:45.597 --> 11:48.097
Man, that was even weirder
than the volcano.

11:48.099 --> 11:51.784
Nothing is weirder
than lava at mini golf.

11:51.786 --> 11:54.170
-Hey, Carlos, you okay?
-CARLOS: Yeah, just, um...

11:54.864 --> 11:56.122
looking for TK.

11:56.124 --> 11:57.632
Medical's pulling in now.

11:58.701 --> 11:59.625
Thanks.

11:59.627 --> 12:00.677
(truck beeping)

12:05.892 --> 12:07.225
Hey, Carlos.

12:08.729 --> 12:11.086
Hi, baby.
You here for lunch?

12:11.088 --> 12:13.565
-Um--
-Please, just
don't say frog legs.

12:14.717 --> 12:17.318
Actually, uh, can we talk?

12:17.979 --> 12:19.320
Sure. Yeah.

12:26.972 --> 12:28.413
You're pissed.

12:28.415 --> 12:29.539
No.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.658
Maybe.

12:32.660 --> 12:34.419
Just a little confused. Um...

12:35.772 --> 12:37.213
So you're married.

12:37.832 --> 12:38.982
In name only.

12:38.984 --> 12:40.817
To a woman?

12:40.819 --> 12:42.652
Back then, that was
the only way you could do it.

12:42.654 --> 12:45.171
Who is this person?
I mean, did she need
a green card or something?

12:45.173 --> 12:47.248
No, we went
to high school together.

12:47.250 --> 12:48.508
She was a few years ahead of me.

12:48.510 --> 12:51.828
We were best friends,
and we were both...

12:51.830 --> 12:54.147
lost... I guess?

12:55.683 --> 12:57.758
When I came out to my parents...

12:57.760 --> 13:00.487
and the way that they never
talked about it again, it...

13:01.931 --> 13:03.281
it felt like
I'd disappointed them.

13:03.283 --> 13:05.992
-So you married a woman?
-I married my best friend.

13:09.514 --> 13:10.863
And did she know
you were gay?

13:10.865 --> 13:14.033
She knew everything about me.
We loved each other, TK.

13:14.035 --> 13:15.943
And we tried
to convince ourselves

13:15.945 --> 13:17.462
that we could make it work.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.546
We were wrong.

13:20.675 --> 13:21.800
But you never got a divorce?

13:21.802 --> 13:23.134
We meant to.

13:23.136 --> 13:25.862
But... things happened.

13:25.864 --> 13:29.623
Well, you'd need
to get a divorce, Carlos.

13:29.625 --> 13:31.100
I'm aware.

13:32.887 --> 13:35.129
Okay. If-if she was
your best friend,

13:35.131 --> 13:36.630
then how come
I've never met her?

13:36.632 --> 13:39.058
I mean, is she--
is she still in Texas?

13:39.060 --> 13:41.044
Far as I know. Yeah.

13:41.046 --> 13:42.228
(TK sighs)

13:42.230 --> 13:44.547
You remember Captain Blake?

13:44.549 --> 13:46.157
Michelle?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.660
Wait, Michelle Blake
is your wife?

13:48.662 --> 13:50.411
Michelle is my sister-in-law.

13:51.665 --> 13:53.498
I'm married to Iris.

13:53.500 --> 13:56.167
Iris, Michelle's little sister,
the one that went missing?

13:56.169 --> 13:58.202
I told you things happened.

13:58.204 --> 14:00.821
TK, we all thought she was dead.

14:00.823 --> 14:02.489
Then she came back.

14:02.491 --> 14:04.417
CARLOS:
With schizophrenia.

14:04.419 --> 14:05.492
She needed help.

14:05.494 --> 14:07.995
And staying married
is helping her?

14:07.997 --> 14:10.598
My health insurance
is helping her.

14:15.080 --> 14:17.355
(sighs deeply)

14:25.866 --> 14:27.657
Is she doing better now?

14:28.869 --> 14:30.201
I don't know.

14:33.098 --> 14:34.931
What does Michelle say?

14:34.933 --> 14:36.165
I meant to call them.

14:37.693 --> 14:39.210
Both of them.

14:41.106 --> 14:42.714
There's no excuse.

14:45.126 --> 14:46.885
I'm a terrible friend.

14:46.887 --> 14:48.794
Hey, hey, hey.

14:48.796 --> 14:50.204
No, you're not.

14:50.206 --> 14:52.798
No, you are not, okay?

14:52.800 --> 14:54.392
You're an incredible friend.

14:55.803 --> 14:58.287
Everything's gonna be okay.

14:58.289 --> 14:59.898
We have so much time
to figure it out.

14:59.900 --> 15:01.399
We have a year and a half.

15:02.736 --> 15:05.403
-We have eight weeks.
-TK: What?

15:05.405 --> 15:07.906
Eight weeks, what--
What do you mean eight weeks?

15:07.908 --> 15:10.557
CARLOS:
The venue called.
There was a cancellation.

15:10.559 --> 15:13.727
There's an opening
in eight weeks if we want it.

15:13.729 --> 15:14.579
TK: What?

15:14.581 --> 15:16.322
Baby, that's fantastic!

15:16.324 --> 15:17.640
Um...

15:17.659 --> 15:20.993
Is-is eight weeks enough time
to get a divorce?

15:20.995 --> 15:22.311
Better be.

15:22.313 --> 15:24.756
The-the-the state of Texas
requires you to be

15:24.758 --> 15:25.757
divorced a full month

15:25.759 --> 15:27.342
before you can get
married again.

15:34.434 --> 15:36.434
♪

15:38.421 --> 15:40.587
What you doin'?
You hangin' a little bell there?

15:40.589 --> 15:41.755
OWEN: Yep.

15:41.775 --> 15:43.942
What, so's we can hear you
when you pull up?

15:43.944 --> 15:46.593
Ha, no, no, the tailpipes
take care of that.

15:46.595 --> 15:48.354
It's a Gremlin Bell.

15:48.356 --> 15:50.448
-Say what?
-OWEN: A Gremlin Bell.

15:50.450 --> 15:53.267
-Oh.
-It wards off gremlins
and, and bad spirits.

15:53.269 --> 15:55.602
The theory being you put it
in the lowest point of the bike,

15:55.604 --> 15:57.863
when you're out for a ride
and you ride over a gremlin

15:57.865 --> 15:59.657
and it tries to grab on,

15:59.659 --> 16:00.959
it gets caught in the bell.

16:02.295 --> 16:05.112
Biking community's got
a ton of great stuff like that.

16:05.114 --> 16:06.447
Yeah, we should get
a mess of 'em

16:06.449 --> 16:07.873
and put 'em on the rigs,
it'll make things easier.

16:07.875 --> 16:10.376
Oh, no, no.
You can't just go out
and buy a Gremlin Bell.

16:10.378 --> 16:13.162
It has to be gifted to you
by another rider

16:13.164 --> 16:14.380
or the magic doesn't work.

16:14.382 --> 16:15.531
Oh, of course.

16:15.717 --> 16:18.551
So one of your, uh,
biker buddies gave you that?

16:18.553 --> 16:19.960
Yeah, Red gave it to me.

16:19.962 --> 16:22.397
Oh, Red. Right.

16:23.799 --> 16:26.392
Uh, Owen?

16:26.394 --> 16:28.561
If I'm outta line here,
you just tell me.

16:28.563 --> 16:31.972
But... you okay?

16:31.974 --> 16:33.157
Yeah. Why would you ask me that?

16:33.159 --> 16:34.826
Well, it appears
that you've fallen in

16:34.828 --> 16:37.328
with some Hells Angels
that you met at a stoplight.

16:37.330 --> 16:39.247
As your friend,
that's concerning.

16:40.391 --> 16:43.317
The Honor Dogs
are not Hells Angels.

16:43.319 --> 16:45.394
-Hm.
-They're motorcycle enthusiasts.

16:45.396 --> 16:47.580
Professional guys
like you and me.
You'd love 'em.

16:47.582 --> 16:52.677
In fact, I'm invited to a thing
at their roadhouse Thursday.

16:52.679 --> 16:54.920
You should come.
Because I think

16:54.922 --> 16:57.423
-I'm getting a cool nickname.
-Ooh, like Red?

16:57.425 --> 17:00.334
Yeah, h-hopefully
better than that.
Anyway, you should come.

17:00.336 --> 17:02.762
It'd give you a chance
to dust off your bike.

17:02.764 --> 17:03.929
Well, I ain't got no bike.

17:03.931 --> 17:05.765
Really?

17:05.767 --> 17:07.083
Always pictured you with a bike.

17:07.085 --> 17:07.917
Well, I have a dirt bike.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.268
Don't bring that. Oh!

17:09.270 --> 17:12.104
And first responders
get great deals on these.

17:12.106 --> 17:13.865
I can hook you up
with my dude.

17:13.867 --> 17:15.925
(sighs)
I don-- I don't know.

17:15.927 --> 17:18.094
You know, I feel like I,
I risk my neck enough at work,

17:18.096 --> 17:20.038
and Grace wouldn't like it.

17:20.040 --> 17:21.355
(Owen snaps fingers)

17:21.357 --> 17:24.225
Grace wouldn't like it,
but you would, right?

17:24.227 --> 17:26.435
I see the way
you look at this. Oh!

17:26.437 --> 17:30.631
You would have the best nickname
of all time, Easy Ryder.

17:31.700 --> 17:33.534
Get it? Easy Ryder.

17:33.536 --> 17:35.278
Yeah, I get it.
I just, I don't, I don't know

17:35.280 --> 17:37.280
if that's reason enough
to invest.

17:37.282 --> 17:39.298
Oh, come on.
Change your mind.
You'll have fun.

17:39.300 --> 17:42.060
I ain't gonna fit
on the back of this bike.

17:42.062 --> 17:43.561
We'll go in my car.

17:46.215 --> 17:47.881
<i> A lot of relieved Austinites</i>

17:47.883 --> 17:50.401
<i> as today's violent storm</i>
<i> known as a derecho,</i>

17:50.403 --> 17:53.387
<i> or inland hurricane,</i>
<i> went as quickly as it came</i>

17:53.389 --> 17:55.889
<i> leaving behind</i>
<i> some web-footed friends</i>

17:55.891 --> 17:56.908
<i> at the Travis County Fair,</i>

17:56.910 --> 17:58.559
which has now reopened.

17:58.561 --> 17:59.835
But is it safe?

17:59.837 --> 18:02.471
<i> For that, we go to</i>
<i> meteorologist Randi Gray.</i>

18:02.473 --> 18:04.916
If she says
swarm of locusts next, I'm out.

18:04.918 --> 18:07.935
<i>...clear skies</i>
<i>and a warmer system rolling in.</i>

18:07.937 --> 18:10.571
<i> We've seen the last</i>
<i> of the precipitation for now.</i>

18:10.573 --> 18:14.425
<i> Though, there is the outside</i>
<i> chance of a mild heat burst.</i>

18:14.427 --> 18:17.095
NEWSCASTER (on TV):
<i> You said heat burst.</i>
<i> What's that?</i>

18:17.097 --> 18:19.505
A heat burst is a rare
atmospheric phenomenon

18:19.507 --> 18:23.159
that can sometimes follow
a storm like we saw today.

18:23.161 --> 18:25.995
A sudden localized increase
in air temperature

18:25.997 --> 18:27.830
<i> and some pretty gusty winds.</i>

18:27.832 --> 18:28.848
<i> What are the odds of that?</i>

18:28.850 --> 18:30.090
<i> Ah, one in a million.</i>

18:30.092 --> 18:31.609
So that's definitely
gonna happen.

18:31.611 --> 18:32.777
-Yep.
-ALL: Yeah.

18:32.779 --> 18:33.853
Yeah.

18:33.855 --> 18:36.531
(carnival music playing)

18:39.026 --> 18:41.344
Alright, alright.
What do we have?

18:41.346 --> 18:44.029
We, uh, we got a ring toss.

18:44.031 --> 18:45.865
Ooh, we got a hayride.

18:45.867 --> 18:47.750
We got a tilt-a-whirl.

18:49.020 --> 18:50.035
What are we even doing here?

18:50.037 --> 18:51.945
Uh, hopefully beating the rush

18:51.947 --> 18:53.689
to the butter sculptures.

18:53.691 --> 18:55.133
Shouldn't you be resting?

18:55.135 --> 18:57.360
I can't let a little frog mouth

18:57.362 --> 18:59.528
spoil our first day
in Austin now.

18:59.530 --> 19:02.531
-Kinda hard to come back from.
-Come on, Mel.

19:02.533 --> 19:06.552
Back in Topeka, we had to
drag you away from the fair.

19:06.554 --> 19:08.980
Remember you and Mom
taking all them selfies

19:08.982 --> 19:10.130
with that prize pumpkin?

19:10.132 --> 19:11.965
That was different.

19:11.967 --> 19:14.043
'Cause that was with Mom.

19:14.045 --> 19:15.653
Listen, sweetie.

19:17.806 --> 19:20.049
I know...

19:20.051 --> 19:23.219
choosing who to live with
was hard.

19:23.221 --> 19:26.555
And I'm so sorry that you
were put in that position.

19:26.557 --> 19:27.481
(grunts)

19:27.483 --> 19:28.649
Excuse me.

19:28.651 --> 19:29.584
(sighs)

19:31.171 --> 19:35.006
Just, you know,
look around, hey?

19:35.008 --> 19:37.400
Look around.
Texas ain't so bad, right?

19:37.402 --> 19:40.419
Just promise me you won't
start wearing a cowboy hat.

19:40.421 --> 19:41.495
I can't promise you that.

19:41.739 --> 19:46.575
But... I can let you,
uh, pick the next ride.

19:46.577 --> 19:48.019
Anything I want?

19:49.263 --> 19:53.149
Yeah, I'm-I'm-I'm gonna
regret that one, huh?

19:58.940 --> 20:00.198
-Whoo!
-(nervously): Uh...

20:01.201 --> 20:03.201
Why did I let you
talk me into this?

20:03.203 --> 20:04.851
Come on, Dad, have a little fun.

20:04.853 --> 20:06.621
(enthusiastically):
Yeah, yeah, fun.

20:07.598 --> 20:08.581
So much fun.

20:11.269 --> 20:13.461
Alright, alright.
(chuckles nervously)

20:17.108 --> 20:19.258
(thunder rumbling)

20:24.707 --> 20:26.349
Hey, ride's over.

20:33.474 --> 20:35.624
<i> Ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i> we apologize.</i>

20:35.626 --> 20:38.811
<i> But we're going to have to</i>
<i> end the ride at this time.</i>

20:38.813 --> 20:40.296
What's going on?

20:40.298 --> 20:43.324
Oh. Well, I think
it's the lightning, sweetie.

20:44.744 --> 20:46.202
(carnival music fading)

20:47.305 --> 20:49.730
-(ride rattling)
-(thunder rumbling)

20:49.732 --> 20:51.156
-MELODY: Why are we stopping?
-It's alright.

20:51.158 --> 20:53.334
-What's happening?
-It's alright. It's alright.

21:00.760 --> 21:03.427
(metal grinding)

21:09.102 --> 21:11.227
Right this way, guys.

21:12.105 --> 21:14.355
Hey, bring us down!

21:23.691 --> 21:26.191
Dad?
Why are we going up?

21:26.193 --> 21:28.661
We have to go up
to come down, sweetie.

21:29.938 --> 21:32.498
-(rattling)
-(metallic squeaking)

21:40.525 --> 21:41.549
(wind gusting)

21:44.378 --> 21:46.345
-MAN: Whoa. Watch out.
-(screaming)

21:48.032 --> 21:50.699
OPERATOR:
Come on. God!

21:50.701 --> 21:51.475
-(sizzles)
-MELODY: Ow!

21:53.629 --> 21:54.628
Are you alright?

21:54.630 --> 21:55.646
It burned me.

21:56.799 --> 21:57.815
Oh.

21:57.817 --> 22:00.192
Dad, I wanna get out here.

22:03.731 --> 22:05.531
(both grunting)

22:06.717 --> 22:08.492
(creaking)

22:10.905 --> 22:12.538
Hey, bring us down!

22:13.574 --> 22:15.124
(crashing)

22:19.564 --> 22:21.063
(rattling)

22:21.065 --> 22:22.631
Ah, it's alright. It's alright.

22:24.569 --> 22:25.468
(man screaming)

22:26.495 --> 22:27.720
(screams)

22:29.757 --> 22:30.723
-Oh, my God!
-Oh!

22:32.018 --> 22:34.518
(screaming)

22:41.510 --> 22:42.610
(thuds)

22:47.516 --> 22:49.758
Where you landed?
Are you in an aircraft, sir?

22:49.760 --> 22:51.535
No. Porta-potty.

22:51.537 --> 22:52.686
<i> The wind picked me up.</i>

22:52.688 --> 22:53.779
<i> I'm at the fair.</i>

22:53.781 --> 22:54.872
(Caleb exhales)

22:54.874 --> 22:56.098
It's so hot.

22:56.100 --> 22:57.266
What do you see around you?

22:57.268 --> 22:59.860
Uh, the inside
of the porta-potty.

22:59.862 --> 23:02.438
Okay. Can you
make your way out?

23:02.440 --> 23:03.464
(thuds)

23:05.776 --> 23:07.960
No, stupid thing's melted shut.

23:07.962 --> 23:09.962
Alright, sir, listen,
my name is Grace.

23:09.964 --> 23:11.447
I'm gonna get
some help to you, okay?

23:11.449 --> 23:12.297
Are you injured?

23:12.299 --> 23:13.799
CALEB (on phone):
<i> I'm alright.</i>

23:13.801 --> 23:14.892
Except, uh...

23:14.894 --> 23:16.560
(heavy breathing)

23:16.562 --> 23:17.686
...I'm sinking.

23:25.463 --> 23:28.322
(siren wailing)

23:30.243 --> 23:32.350
I'm seeing heatstroke
left and right.

23:32.352 --> 23:33.819
Remember,
when they've stopped sweating,

23:33.821 --> 23:35.079
that's when they get a red tag.

23:35.230 --> 23:38.490
And where exactly did
the flying toilet come down?

23:38.492 --> 23:41.310
I don't know, like-like
over there somewhere.

23:41.312 --> 23:44.146
Let's hope it didn't
land on anybody else.

23:44.148 --> 23:45.906
Hey, Cap, dispatch is
saying we got a kid

23:45.908 --> 23:47.499
in a honey pot
that's taking on water.

23:47.501 --> 23:48.575
Water?

23:48.577 --> 23:51.429
Help! Help!

23:51.431 --> 23:52.787
Help me!

23:52.789 --> 23:54.673
Help, I'm gonna drown!

23:54.675 --> 23:57.601
Okay, Caleb, listen,
I need you calm, okay?

23:57.603 --> 24:01.013
<i> So let's try this.</i>
<i> Take a deep,</i>
<i> four-second breath.</i>

24:01.015 --> 24:03.423
(inhales, coughs)

24:03.425 --> 24:03.941
Caleb?

24:03.943 --> 24:05.684
(Caleb groaning)

24:05.686 --> 24:06.835
The air.

24:06.837 --> 24:08.779
It's burning my throat.

24:08.781 --> 24:10.430
It's all this blue junk.

24:10.432 --> 24:12.191
Unfortunately,
some of those chemicals

24:12.193 --> 24:13.784
do release toxic fumes.

24:13.786 --> 24:15.527
What, like poo?

24:15.529 --> 24:17.196
No, like formaldehyde.

24:17.198 --> 24:19.940
Alright, Caleb,
I need you to focus with me

24:19.942 --> 24:22.701
so we can get you
outta there, okay?

24:22.703 --> 24:24.628
The water's getting higher!

24:24.630 --> 24:26.205
It's okay. I know it is.

24:26.207 --> 24:28.023
Listen, I need you
to check your pockets.

24:28.025 --> 24:30.301
Do you have a key chain
or loose change?

24:30.303 --> 24:32.878
<i> -Anything like that?</i>
-Uh...

24:32.880 --> 24:34.046
Some loose change, yeah.

24:34.048 --> 24:35.389
Do you have a quarter?

24:36.367 --> 24:37.883
-Yeah.
-GRACE:<i> Now take a look</i>

24:37.885 --> 24:38.959
at the roof above you.

24:38.961 --> 24:40.311
There should be flathead rivets.

24:40.313 --> 24:42.963
I need you to use that quarter
to turn it

24:42.965 --> 24:44.130
<i> and try to loosen 'em.</i>

24:44.132 --> 24:46.192
(heavy breathing)

24:48.896 --> 24:50.488
It's working.

24:50.490 --> 24:51.396
It's working!

24:51.491 --> 24:53.048
Okay, good.
Just keep on turning it.

24:53.050 --> 24:54.700
(coughing)

24:55.811 --> 24:57.811
No. No!

24:57.813 --> 24:58.904
<i> No, no, no!</i>

24:58.906 --> 25:00.498
What happened?

25:00.500 --> 25:01.582
I dropped it.

25:02.668 --> 25:04.910
I'm gonna drown.
(coughs)

25:06.230 --> 25:09.064
Listen, hang on for me.
I'm checking in with my team.

25:09.066 --> 25:10.323
<i> Captain Strand,</i>
<i> what's your status?</i>

25:10.325 --> 25:13.159
Yeah, look,
there's no water in the midway.

25:13.161 --> 25:15.829
Is it maybe blown into
a pool or a reservoir?

25:15.831 --> 25:17.406
Lake Travis?

25:17.408 --> 25:19.183
GRACE:
No, there's nothing
like that in the area.

25:19.185 --> 25:20.592
And his cell phone
is still pinging

25:20.594 --> 25:22.094
somewhere on
the fairgrounds.

25:22.096 --> 25:24.355
Hey, Gracie, do we have any
water rides or anything here?

25:24.357 --> 25:25.764
Bumper boats,
anything like that?

25:25.766 --> 25:28.433
I mean, I looked,
but the fair has 300 vendors,

25:28.435 --> 25:29.418
<i> all on separate contracts.</i>

25:29.511 --> 25:31.237
And he doesn't have
a lot of time.

25:33.366 --> 25:36.492
PAUL (on radio):
<i> Uh, Cap, I think</i>
<i> we got something.</i>

25:41.040 --> 25:43.332
So, not Lake Travis.

25:47.121 --> 25:49.547
Alright.
Halligans and chainsaws.

25:50.457 --> 25:51.340
Caleb.

25:52.109 --> 25:54.385
(chainsaw buzzing)

26:02.953 --> 26:04.228
MATEO: We're in.

26:05.472 --> 26:06.397
(grunts)

26:07.808 --> 26:10.216
I got him.
We need Medical.

26:10.218 --> 26:12.644
Caleb?
Is he okay?

26:12.646 --> 26:13.796
Caleb!

26:13.798 --> 26:15.739
(flatlining)

26:25.659 --> 26:26.825
(monitor beeping)

26:26.827 --> 26:27.826
(coughing)

26:27.828 --> 26:29.128
He's got a pulse, Cap.

26:29.922 --> 26:31.738
In the 120s and stabilizing.

26:31.740 --> 26:33.832
-BRIANNA: Caleb.
-CALEB: Bri.

26:33.834 --> 26:34.925
(Caleb exhales)

26:34.927 --> 26:37.428
Thought I was gonna die
in the crapper.

26:37.430 --> 26:38.929
Why does he
still look cyanotic?

26:38.931 --> 26:41.098
I think he's just blue.

26:41.100 --> 26:43.992
No, Caleb, no, hon,
don't sit up.

26:43.994 --> 26:45.494
I told you I'd fight for you.

26:45.496 --> 26:46.312
Oh.

26:46.772 --> 26:48.254
I love you.

26:48.256 --> 26:50.774
Is he okay?
Is he gonna be okay?

26:50.776 --> 26:51.925
With a hefty dose
of antibiotics,

26:51.927 --> 26:53.518
he should be just fine.

26:53.520 --> 26:55.095
Good.

26:55.097 --> 26:59.174
And maybe I'll treat you both
just to be safe.

26:59.176 --> 27:00.859
Alright, let's clear
this whole area.

27:00.861 --> 27:03.436
Every booth, every tent,
every ride.

27:03.438 --> 27:04.529
Hey. Help!

27:04.531 --> 27:06.457
Help. We need help.

27:06.459 --> 27:08.959
We managed to get
most everybody off the Zipper.

27:08.961 --> 27:11.019
But there's still two people
trapped up top.

27:11.021 --> 27:12.630
We tried to get
the motor going again

27:12.632 --> 27:13.964
and then that happened.

27:13.966 --> 27:15.507
MARJAN: Oh, God.

27:17.711 --> 27:18.802
TREVOR:
Hey, we're up here!

27:18.804 --> 27:19.786
Up here!

27:20.030 --> 27:21.213
Hey, Cap, we can
run back to the truck

27:21.382 --> 27:23.307
and get the rescue cushion up
in about five minutes.

27:23.309 --> 27:25.392
OWEN:
They don't have five minutes.

27:27.872 --> 27:29.313
(Melody coughing)

27:30.557 --> 27:31.965
Dad...

27:31.967 --> 27:33.225
it's really hot in here.

27:33.227 --> 27:35.060
I know, sweetie. I know.

27:35.062 --> 27:36.970
Alright. Let's use this tarp.

27:36.972 --> 27:38.489
We're gonna make a life net.

27:41.661 --> 27:44.069
Stretch it out.

27:44.071 --> 27:45.979
<i> Alright, they tell me</i>
<i> that there's a latch</i>

27:45.981 --> 27:46.997
<i> on the right-hand side</i>

27:46.999 --> 27:48.240
<i> of your bucket up there.</i>

27:48.242 --> 27:50.167
<i> You need to open it,</i>
<i> turn around.</i>

27:50.169 --> 27:52.060
<i> You're gonna fall back first.</i>

27:52.062 --> 27:53.578
<i> We will catch you.</i>

27:53.580 --> 27:54.546
Alright.

27:56.417 --> 27:57.232
Alright.

27:57.401 --> 27:59.093
Alright, watch yourself,
sweetie.

28:00.513 --> 28:02.262
(grunts)

28:09.855 --> 28:11.522
I can't.

28:12.507 --> 28:13.932
I can't do it.

28:13.934 --> 28:15.484
You don't have to do a thing.

28:17.012 --> 28:19.321
That's why
the Lord made gravity.

28:19.940 --> 28:21.323
(screams)

28:23.427 --> 28:26.094
-Is she alright?
-OWEN: She's fine.

28:26.096 --> 28:27.204
It's your turn.

28:27.206 --> 28:29.248
Great job.
Come on, come with me.

28:30.100 --> 28:31.458
-(sizzles)
-(screams)

28:32.453 --> 28:33.377
(groans)

28:36.382 --> 28:37.464
(groans)

28:38.959 --> 28:41.960
-So, not a tiny man.
-Just hang on tight.

28:41.962 --> 28:43.737
Heard you might need
an extra pair of hands.

28:43.739 --> 28:44.680
Yeah. Get in here.

28:45.799 --> 28:47.282
One...

28:47.284 --> 28:49.059
(quietly):
Lord, give me strength.

28:49.061 --> 28:50.394
OWEN:
...two...

28:52.881 --> 28:54.148
(all grunt)

28:58.404 --> 28:59.361
Whoa!

29:02.557 --> 29:04.032
(chuckling)

29:12.234 --> 29:14.567
Alright, hold still.
How's that?

29:14.569 --> 29:16.328
TOMMY VEGA:
Okay, when you're
changing her bandage,

29:16.330 --> 29:20.332
run this arm under cold water,
alright, Dad?

29:20.334 --> 29:21.258
Will do.

29:21.260 --> 29:24.244
So, Melody,
do you like slushies?

29:24.246 --> 29:26.263
-Blue raspberry?
-Absolutely.

29:26.265 --> 29:28.915
We are giving them away
just right over there.

29:28.917 --> 29:30.659
You see that?

29:30.661 --> 29:31.660
Go get one.

29:31.662 --> 29:32.828
I'll get you one too, Dad.

29:32.830 --> 29:33.604
Thanks, sweetie.

29:37.425 --> 29:38.525
Okay.

29:41.429 --> 29:42.521
Let's see.

29:42.523 --> 29:44.448
Oh. Alright.

29:45.284 --> 29:47.009
She's been through a lot today.

29:47.011 --> 29:48.693
Oh, you have no idea.

29:48.695 --> 29:52.122
We're still adjusting to it
just being the two of us.

29:52.124 --> 29:54.333
-TOMMY: Hm.
-Mel's been a real champ.

29:55.519 --> 29:56.852
Oh, yeah.

29:56.854 --> 29:59.630
My girls were my rock
when my husband passed away.

30:00.949 --> 30:02.615
I'm sorry for your loss.

30:02.617 --> 30:07.763
Melody's mother is still alive.
We're, um, recently divorced.

30:08.866 --> 30:09.765
Oh.

30:13.037 --> 30:17.231
Uh, you, um, uh,
do have superficial burns.

30:18.133 --> 30:20.725
Just keep them loosely wrapped

30:20.727 --> 30:23.320
and, uh, I will get you, um,

30:23.322 --> 30:27.640
a roll of Kerlix... gauze.
Okay?

30:27.642 --> 30:28.659
TREVOR: Thank you.

30:30.663 --> 30:32.287
(exhales)

30:33.815 --> 30:34.748
Saw that.

30:35.984 --> 30:37.150
What?

30:37.152 --> 30:39.061
You and your frog prince.

30:39.063 --> 30:40.838
Oh, he's a patient, Nancy.

30:40.840 --> 30:43.081
A repeat customer.

30:43.083 --> 30:44.900
You should just go ahead
and give him your number

30:44.902 --> 30:45.992
so he stops dialing 9-1-1.

30:45.994 --> 30:47.402
Bye, Nance.

30:47.404 --> 30:48.387
Bye.

30:51.925 --> 30:52.850
Here you go.

30:52.852 --> 30:54.351
Oh, a freebie. Thanks.

30:54.353 --> 30:56.562
Well, consider it
a welcome to the neighborhood.

30:57.598 --> 30:58.605
-Alright.
-TOMMY: Alright.

31:06.532 --> 31:09.758
Uh, can I have that back?

31:09.760 --> 31:10.942
Uh, sure?

31:10.944 --> 31:12.260
Great, um...

31:12.262 --> 31:14.872
uh, Melody's about
the same age as my girls,

31:14.874 --> 31:19.001
so maybe we can arrange
for a playdate.

31:19.786 --> 31:22.421
A playdate or a date-date?

31:25.792 --> 31:27.259
I'm good with either one.

31:32.966 --> 31:34.224
(laughs)

31:38.046 --> 31:39.897
Alright.
The clinic opens at 9:00

31:39.899 --> 31:41.881
and ESL classes at 10:00.

31:41.883 --> 31:42.983
Welcome home.

31:44.811 --> 31:45.977
Can I help you?

31:45.979 --> 31:49.131
Hey. I'm looking
for a Michelle Blake.

31:49.133 --> 31:51.408
I tried calling, but it
keeps going to voice mail.

31:51.410 --> 31:54.803
It's probably because
the service is sketchy

31:54.805 --> 31:56.288
where she is in Ecuador.

31:57.583 --> 31:59.249
-CARLOS: Ecuador?
-Yeah.

31:59.251 --> 32:01.501
She's there for three months
on an outreach mission.

32:03.480 --> 32:04.379
Oh.

32:06.425 --> 32:09.593
I'm actually looking
for her sister, Iris.

32:09.595 --> 32:11.929
I know she, she
was here for a while.

32:11.931 --> 32:12.912
Do you know where she might be?

32:12.914 --> 32:14.389
Yeah, around the corner.

32:23.834 --> 32:25.350
PATIENT:
No. No, you,
you aren't listening,

32:25.352 --> 32:27.686
you aren't,
you aren't hearing me!

32:27.688 --> 32:29.595
VOLUNTEER:
I am listening.
I'm here with you. I hear what--

32:29.597 --> 32:33.191
PATIENT:
No, if everything is everything
and everything is a circle,

32:33.193 --> 32:34.843
then life is water, right?

32:34.845 --> 32:38.346
But energy plus time is heat.
Don't get in the car!

32:38.348 --> 32:39.456
-Don't go with him!
-I need you to take this pill

32:39.458 --> 32:40.940
because it's gonna help you
feel better.

32:40.942 --> 32:42.684
It'll help you relax, okay?

32:42.686 --> 32:43.710
Here you go.

32:49.860 --> 32:50.875
Carlos?

32:50.877 --> 32:52.260
Iris?

32:55.215 --> 32:58.684
Oh, God, I missed you so much.
(sighs)

33:01.814 --> 33:03.522
You should've come sooner.

33:06.877 --> 33:08.318
Coffee?

33:12.640 --> 33:13.657
This place is great.

33:13.659 --> 33:15.659
Saved my life.

33:15.661 --> 33:19.746
Well, Michelle saved my life
with a big assist from you.

33:21.058 --> 33:22.499
Thank you for always
having our backs.

33:22.501 --> 33:25.127
She and I got pretty tight
after you went missing.

33:25.912 --> 33:27.078
Whenever she got arrested,

33:27.080 --> 33:28.913
I made sure
to be the one doing it.

33:28.915 --> 33:30.632
Yeah. She told me.

33:31.510 --> 33:33.735
She really loves you.

33:33.737 --> 33:35.570
I guess all Blake women do.

33:35.572 --> 33:36.680
Iris, I'm...

33:37.683 --> 33:39.224
I'm so sorry, I...

33:40.394 --> 33:42.335
I should have
checked in earlier.

33:42.337 --> 33:44.262
I thought we were done
with that part.

33:44.264 --> 33:46.398
Or do you want me
to slap you again?

33:46.859 --> 33:48.191
Not really.

33:49.361 --> 33:50.610
Iris...

33:51.922 --> 33:52.696
You look so...

33:52.698 --> 33:55.090
Normal? Stable? Un-insane?

33:55.092 --> 33:56.742
-Happy.
-(Iris chuckles)

33:56.744 --> 33:58.943
Yeah, I guess I am, aren't I?

33:58.945 --> 34:01.872
I don't know.
Working here and, and
helping the community,

34:01.874 --> 34:03.040
something clicked.

34:03.042 --> 34:04.783
You know, cherry on top?

34:04.785 --> 34:06.101
Free coffee.

34:06.103 --> 34:07.360
IRIS BLAKE:
Health benefits.

34:07.362 --> 34:10.363
Sanctuary Hearts has
full coverage, meds and all.

34:10.365 --> 34:12.549
I'm no longer
your responsibility, Carlos.

34:16.555 --> 34:18.630
Tell me about this boy.

34:18.632 --> 34:20.965
TK. Well, he, uh...

34:20.967 --> 34:22.284
He used to be a firefighter
in New York.

34:22.286 --> 34:23.543
-Mm-hmm.
-Now he's a paramedic.

34:23.545 --> 34:25.378
Always good to have
one of those in the family.

34:25.380 --> 34:27.806
-He's been through a lot.
-IRIS: Hm.

34:27.808 --> 34:28.732
Currently not in a coma.

34:28.734 --> 34:30.192
Also a plus.

34:30.794 --> 34:31.693
What can I say?

34:33.054 --> 34:34.720
He's the one.

34:34.722 --> 34:36.073
Yeah, but is he hot?

34:36.075 --> 34:37.148
Smokin'.

34:37.392 --> 34:39.534
-Well, I can't wait to meet him.
-CARLOS: Well...

34:40.971 --> 34:42.804
you'll come to the wedding.

34:42.806 --> 34:43.822
Oh, no.

34:43.824 --> 34:46.491
I think I need
to meet him before that.

34:46.493 --> 34:47.992
You know, if I'm gonna sign
the divorce papers

34:47.994 --> 34:49.753
with a clear conscience.

34:49.755 --> 34:50.670
(chuckles)

34:53.667 --> 34:54.983
You're joking.

34:54.985 --> 34:56.259
How's tomorrow night?

35:01.934 --> 35:03.749
(country music playing)

35:03.751 --> 35:07.604
Huh? I mean, how great is this?
This is why I came to Texas.

35:07.606 --> 35:09.831
Y'all don't have any gay bars
in New York City?

35:09.833 --> 35:11.015
What?

35:11.017 --> 35:12.167
I'm messin' with you.

35:12.185 --> 35:13.610
Hey, this don't look like
Hells Angels.

35:13.612 --> 35:16.855
This sort of looks like
my dad's VFW meets, uh,
the Elks.

35:16.857 --> 35:17.930
RED: Strand.

35:17.932 --> 35:19.507
Get your manicured butt
over here.

35:19.509 --> 35:20.842
-Hey!
-(Red laughing)

35:20.844 --> 35:22.953
I hope you don't mind
I brought a friend with me.

35:22.955 --> 35:24.529
-This is Judd Ryder.
-Easy Ryder.

35:24.531 --> 35:27.182
-RED: How do.
-Uh, Th-That's what
I was saying.

35:27.184 --> 35:28.867
-Easy Ryder.
-You a firefighter too, Judd?

35:28.869 --> 35:30.702
Yes, sir. 20 years.

35:30.704 --> 35:32.111
You must've signed on as a pup.

35:32.113 --> 35:34.189
-Yeah, right outta high school.
-That's good.

35:34.191 --> 35:36.115
It means that our supposed
higher education system

35:36.117 --> 35:38.026
didn't get a chance
to brainwash you.

35:38.028 --> 35:39.136
What are you
two heroes drinking?

35:39.138 --> 35:41.138
-Uh, beer suits me.
-RED: Yes, sir.

35:41.140 --> 35:43.140
Uh, mineral water.
I'm driving.

35:43.142 --> 35:44.558
RED: (chuckles)
Mineral water.

35:45.960 --> 35:47.227
You kill me, Strand.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.646
No, Judd, I got this.

35:49.648 --> 35:51.055
RED:
The hell you do.

35:51.057 --> 35:52.965
We don't charge for drinks here.

35:52.967 --> 35:54.693
Bar's always open.
Drinks are always free.

35:56.046 --> 35:57.696
-This him?
-That's him.

35:59.216 --> 36:01.825
Captain Strand, I'm...
I'm Mikey.

36:01.827 --> 36:04.719
It's an honor to meet a genuine
American hero and patriot.

36:04.721 --> 36:07.330
I-I think Red's been
puffing me up just a little bit.

36:07.332 --> 36:10.816
It must be nice
having somebody else
puff you up for once.

36:10.818 --> 36:12.410
You were really in 9/11?

36:12.412 --> 36:14.171
You make it sound like
I was in a band.

36:14.173 --> 36:17.174
I think you need to excuse
Mikey's enthusiasm.

36:17.176 --> 36:18.991
Unlike a lot of other folks,

36:18.993 --> 36:21.236
us Honor Dogs
revere first responders.

36:21.238 --> 36:22.921
Actually attracting
a lot more of 'em.

36:22.923 --> 36:23.996
(microphone feedback)

36:23.998 --> 36:24.997
TURNER:
Alright, Brothers,

36:24.999 --> 36:26.165
the hour is upon us.

36:26.167 --> 36:27.833
It's time to welcome
a new member

36:27.835 --> 36:29.335
into our fraternal order.

36:29.337 --> 36:31.913
This is where I get
my cool nickname.

36:31.915 --> 36:33.932
Mikey, get your ass up here.

36:33.934 --> 36:35.567
(cheering and whooping)

36:41.091 --> 36:42.699
MAN: Come on, Mikey!

36:43.777 --> 36:44.701
You earned this.

36:47.280 --> 36:50.448
Mikey, the pain you feel today,
I want you to remember it.

36:50.450 --> 36:52.191
Because it is just a taste
of the pain

36:52.193 --> 36:53.435
of what we're all
gonna have to endure

36:53.437 --> 36:55.695
if we expect
to take this country back

36:55.697 --> 36:57.530
because there is a war coming!

36:57.532 --> 36:59.365
(cheering)

36:59.367 --> 37:02.052
ALL (chanting):
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!

37:02.054 --> 37:04.796
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!

37:04.798 --> 37:06.890
Dog! Dog!
Dog! Dog!

37:06.892 --> 37:08.708
Hey, Cap, let's go.

37:08.710 --> 37:09.875
I'm right behind you.

37:09.877 --> 37:11.895
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!

37:11.897 --> 37:14.046
Dog! Dog!
Dog! Dog!

37:14.048 --> 37:15.881
(Mikey screams)

37:15.883 --> 37:18.460
Dog! Dog! Dog! Dog!
Dog! Dog!

37:18.462 --> 37:19.444
(cheering)

37:26.561 --> 37:29.729
I can't believe
that I had brunch with a Nazi.

37:29.731 --> 37:31.081
Oh.

37:31.083 --> 37:33.416
I don't know
if I'd call them fellas Nazis.

37:33.418 --> 37:37.128
Really? It was like
the Beer Hall Putsch of 1923.

37:38.072 --> 37:39.238
How did I miss the warning signs

37:39.240 --> 37:40.815
riding with these guys
all this time?

37:40.817 --> 37:43.167
Cap, you were only riding
with them guys for a week.

37:43.169 --> 37:44.986
Yeah, but it was
a very intense week.

37:44.988 --> 37:47.079
And a fun one.

37:47.081 --> 37:49.415
-I'm selling the bike.
-Don't sell the bike. No.

37:49.417 --> 37:50.100
You love that bike.

37:50.102 --> 37:52.936
Eh, I love the idea of it.

37:52.938 --> 37:55.997
Well, don't beat yourself
up too much.

37:55.999 --> 37:57.999
I get it. I understand.

37:58.001 --> 37:59.834
You do?

37:59.836 --> 38:02.094
Yeah. I mean,
you've been kinda...

38:02.096 --> 38:05.189
kinda left to your
own devices lately.

38:05.191 --> 38:07.600
You've been a little isolated.

38:07.602 --> 38:10.028
-Isolated?
-Yeah.

38:10.030 --> 38:13.014
Look, Catherine
took that job in DC.

38:13.016 --> 38:14.106
Alright? Your son's
runnin' around.

38:14.108 --> 38:16.442
He's plannin'
the rest of his life.

38:16.444 --> 38:19.687
I know Mateo's been spending
a lot of time over at Nancy's.

38:19.689 --> 38:22.114
And you and me don't
hardly see each other
outside of work

38:22.116 --> 38:23.300
because I'm at home

38:23.302 --> 38:26.528
trying to learn a toddler
how to potty proper.

38:26.530 --> 38:29.139
-It'll take care of itself.
-Yeah, that's the word.

38:30.033 --> 38:32.642
So... you think I'm lonely?

38:34.796 --> 38:36.220
I think you could
use a friend.

38:36.222 --> 38:39.040
Oh. The last time
I tried fishing for a friend,

38:39.042 --> 38:40.466
he tried to steal my firehouse

38:40.468 --> 38:43.711
and then tried to knock it down
with a wrecking ball.

38:43.713 --> 38:46.489
No, Judd, I'm not lonely,
I'm just bored.

38:47.717 --> 38:50.234
-You're bored?
-Yeah.

38:50.236 --> 38:53.571
So you-- you're telling me that
you ain't living your best life?

38:53.573 --> 38:54.814
OWEN: No.

38:54.816 --> 38:57.292
My best life is
when I have dragons to slay.

38:58.895 --> 39:02.988
Owen, we slay dragons
big and small,

39:02.990 --> 39:05.008
all day, every day,
at the 126.

39:05.010 --> 39:06.176
And you're our captain.

39:06.178 --> 39:07.969
You got plenty of purpose.

39:08.996 --> 39:10.421
Maybe.

39:10.423 --> 39:12.832
Well, if it's any
comfort to you,

39:12.834 --> 39:13.999
you just wait around a minute

39:14.001 --> 39:16.269
and something awful's

"Better is the end of a thing

40:37.251 --> 40:41.420
Ecclesiastes is
one of my favorites.

40:41.422 --> 40:44.999
It's the book
that forces us to ask,

40:45.001 --> 40:49.261
what have I accomplished
in my life?

40:49.263 --> 40:53.450
Ohh, don't get quiet
on me now, church!

41:03.795 --> 41:07.188
Even that time

41:16.808 --> 41:19.142
Well, enough about the past.

41:51.067 --> 41:52.233
What's wrong, Tommy?

41:52.235 --> 41:55.236
I made a pass at my pastor.

41:55.238 --> 41:58.831
TREVOR:
It is indeed a pleasure
and a blessing

41:58.833 --> 42:01.184
