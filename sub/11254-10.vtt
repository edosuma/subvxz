done right.

08:18.539 --> 08:20.917
{\an1}- Daddy, it's carrying
a box of T-shirts.

08:21.000 --> 08:23.085
There's not a lot
that can go wrong.

08:23.169 --> 08:24.253
- Whatever.

08:24.337 --> 08:26.255
{\an1}I was on my way
over here, anyway.

08:26.339 --> 08:29.592
{\an1}I got a bedside visitation
scheduled with Mr. Wilkinson.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.302
{\an1}I better get there
before it's last rites.

08:31.385 --> 08:33.554
{\an3}- You know what?
Dad, you need to slow down.

08:33.638 --> 08:37.933
{\an1}- I don't have time.
Are those peanuts up for grabs?

08:38.017 --> 08:39.101
I'm shipping
a new batch

08:39.184 --> 08:40.727
{\an1}of "Boyce the Choice"
mugs tomorrow.

08:40.811 --> 08:41.938
I could use some of those.

08:42.020 --> 08:44.607
{\an3}- I'm sorry.
Those are evidence.

08:44.690 --> 08:45.983
- Evidence of what?

08:46.067 --> 08:48.236
- That Saxby is a liar.

08:48.319 --> 08:49.862
{\an3}- Yeah, and tonight
on television,

08:49.946 --> 08:53.574
{\an3}I'm finally gonna expose
that lying, fraudulent snake

08:53.658 --> 08:55.076
for what he is.

08:55.159 --> 08:56.702
{\an1}- Boyce, you can't
prove anything.

08:56.786 --> 08:58.579
{\an1}All it is are bags
of Styrofoam,

08:58.663 --> 09:00.623
packing peanuts,
and Bubble Wrap.

09:00.706 --> 09:03.793
- Oh, I could use
the Bubble Wrap.

09:03.876 --> 09:07.463
- Dad, it's evidence.
- Stop saying that!

09:07.546 --> 09:11.968
- White lady's right.
It's circumstantial.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.678
{\an3}You can't get
a conviction with it.

09:13.761 --> 09:16.889
{\an1}- Curtis, did you learn that
in the joint?

09:16.973 --> 09:21.060
{\an3}- Wow.

09:21.143 --> 09:22.812
{\an3}Yeah.

09:22.895 --> 09:25.273
{\an1}- We have to find out
where his real garbage is,

09:25.356 --> 09:26.565
or we can't prove anything.

09:26.649 --> 09:27.984
- You know what?

09:28.067 --> 09:29.819
Last couple of nights,
I've been hanging out

09:29.902 --> 09:31.988
{\an3}on my old corner
on 12th and Paige--

09:32.071 --> 09:33.489
all: Why?

09:33.572 --> 09:35.658
{\an3}- Reasons.

09:35.741 --> 09:39.245
Anyway, this real nice SUV's
been coming by every night,

09:39.328 --> 09:42.164
{\an3}throwing trash bags
on the sidewalk.

09:42.248 --> 09:43.874
- That could be Saxby's guys.

09:43.958 --> 09:47.586
{\an1}- That is Saxby,
oh, coming over there

09:47.670 --> 09:52.341
and dumping his stinky trash in
your poor ghetto neighborhood.

09:52.425 --> 09:53.509
{\an3}- Hey!

09:53.592 --> 09:55.386
We just got a Rite Aid.

09:57.805 --> 10:00.016
{\an1}- How long do you think
it's gonna take

10:00.099 --> 10:02.184
before they drop the garbage?

10:02.268 --> 10:05.730
{\an3}- Could be five minutes.
Could be five hours.

10:05.813 --> 10:09.859
{\an3}Could be three hours.
Could be two hours.

10:09.942 --> 10:12.278
Could be four--
- Curtis!

10:12.361 --> 10:14.196
{\an1}We don't have
that kind of time.

10:14.280 --> 10:16.615
{\an1}Boyce is holding
a press conference at 11:00.

10:16.699 --> 10:18.159
He's counting on us.

10:18.242 --> 10:19.452
{\an3}- Relax.

10:19.535 --> 10:21.996
Just try to get comfortable.

10:22.079 --> 10:23.914
{\an1}- Does this seat warmer
go any higher?

10:23.998 --> 10:27.168
- I got seat warmers?

10:27.251 --> 10:28.878
- Can you turn up the fan?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.421
- You just said you was cold.

10:30.504 --> 10:33.382
{\an1}- My bottom is cold.
The rest of me is hot.

10:33.466 --> 10:36.052
I got zones!

10:36.135 --> 10:37.720
Should've just taken my car,

10:37.803 --> 10:40.222
{\an1}because I have everything
in there set the way I like it.

10:40.306 --> 10:41.349
- Your car would've stuck out

10:41.432 --> 10:43.267
{\an3}like a sore thumb
in this neighborhood.

10:43.351 --> 10:45.227
{\an3}We trying to keep
a low profile.

10:45.311 --> 10:46.979
- Oh, what up, Curtis?

10:47.063 --> 10:49.106
- What up, Drizzle?

10:49.190 --> 10:51.734
- Damn. You on a date?

10:51.817 --> 10:53.569
{\an3}- Nah, we're just
on a stakeout.

10:53.652 --> 10:54.737
{\an1}- Curtis!

10:54.820 --> 10:55.988
- Forget what you heard.

10:56.072 --> 10:57.740
- Will you get out of here?

10:57.823 --> 11:01.660
- Are you gonna finish that?

11:01.744 --> 11:03.954
{\an1}Mmm.

11:04.997 --> 11:06.916
{\an1}- You gonna buy me
another soda.

11:08.709 --> 11:11.003
{\an1}- Okay, I got a bottle
of champagne

11:11.087 --> 11:13.005
to celebrate your
triumph tonight.

11:13.089 --> 11:15.925
{\an3}- Actually, I haven't heard
any news from Lolli yet.

11:16.008 --> 11:17.134
- And I got a bottle of Jack,

11:17.218 --> 11:19.887
{\an1}just in case
it doesn't work out.

11:19.970 --> 11:23.933
{\an3}- Hate to admit it,
but it might be a Jack night.

11:24.016 --> 11:25.768
{\an1}- So do you think
you made a mistake?

11:25.851 --> 11:27.019
- What?
- Well, I mean,

11:27.103 --> 11:28.229
{\an1}your whole life
was great before.

11:28.312 --> 11:30.856
{\an1}I mean, you were a preacher,
and everybody loved you.

11:30.940 --> 11:34.110
{\an3}- Yeah. I mean--
but I had to run for mayor.

11:34.193 --> 11:35.861
{\an1}- No, I know.
I mean, look, I get it.

11:35.945 --> 11:37.947
{\an1}You turned your whole
life upside down,

11:38.030 --> 11:39.949
{\an1}but what if things
don't work out?

11:40.032 --> 11:41.867
{\an3}- It's just a chance
I had to take.

11:41.951 --> 11:44.370
{\an1}- Yeah, but, bro--how do you
know it's all worth it?

11:44.453 --> 11:46.956
{\an3}- Well, you don't...
until you do it.

11:47.039 --> 11:50.126
{\an3}I mean, sometimes you got to get
out of your own comfort zone.

11:50.209 --> 11:52.795
{\an3}Sometimes you got to take
a leap of faith.

11:52.878 --> 11:54.422
{\an1}- Uh-huh.

11:54.505 --> 11:56.298
{\an1}But what if you just signed
a gym membership,

11:56.382 --> 11:58.968
and there's no refunds?

11:59.051 --> 12:02.054
{\an3}- Stamps, have you been
hitting the Jack already?

12:02.138 --> 12:03.431
- No, but maybe I need to.

12:03.514 --> 12:05.474
- Yeah, you do.

12:05.558 --> 12:08.644
{\an1}- Ooh. Wait, wait.
Check it out.

12:08.727 --> 12:11.313
- There he is.
Government car.

12:11.397 --> 12:12.648
- How you know?

12:12.731 --> 12:13.774
- Black SUV,

12:13.858 --> 12:15.234
{\an3}two white guys,
no rims--

12:15.317 --> 12:17.653
that's definitely government.

12:17.736 --> 12:22.825
{\an1}- Shoot. They are putting the
trash out on the sidewalk.

12:22.908 --> 12:26.495
Oh! Quick. Pull up there
so we can get that trash.

12:26.579 --> 12:30.082
[engine sputtering]

12:33.377 --> 12:35.129
I hate your car.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.299
- Excuse me. Sorry.

12:38.382 --> 12:40.009
Sorry. Excuse me.

12:40.092 --> 12:42.678
Excuse me.
Excuse me.

12:42.761 --> 12:44.013
Boyce, the press
is getting antsy.

12:44.096 --> 12:46.015
{\an3}You have got to
tell them something.

12:46.098 --> 12:47.475
- Any signs of Lolli?

12:47.558 --> 12:48.976
- I'll go check
the parking lot again.

12:49.059 --> 12:51.645
{\an1}- Oh, goodness.
All right. Wish me luck.

12:51.729 --> 12:52.855
- You got this.

12:52.938 --> 12:56.734
- B-brothers?
[bullhorn siren wailing]

12:56.817 --> 12:59.528
Brothers--
[siren wails]

12:59.612 --> 13:03.157
You know, I'll just do it
without the bullhorn.

13:03.240 --> 13:06.327
Brothers and sisters, can
I have your attention, please?

13:06.410 --> 13:08.370
I have something to say

13:08.454 --> 13:11.665
that is going to blow
the lid off City Hall.

13:11.749 --> 13:12.708
[crowd murmurs]

13:12.791 --> 13:14.627
I've uncovered a scandal.

13:14.710 --> 13:17.463
I've uncovered a deception.

13:17.546 --> 13:22.051
I've uncovered a shocking
abuse of public trust.

13:22.134 --> 13:23.511
- What do you got, Boyce?

13:23.594 --> 13:25.137
- That's a good question, Biff.

13:25.221 --> 13:26.430
Here...

13:26.514 --> 13:28.891
I found these trash bags

13:28.974 --> 13:31.519
in front
of Mayor Saxby's house.

13:31.602 --> 13:33.646
But look what's inside--

13:33.729 --> 13:35.147
Styrofoam balls.

13:35.231 --> 13:38.901
It's just a bag
full of Styrofoam balls!

13:38.984 --> 13:42.488
{\an3}- Why does he need
so many of those balls?

13:42.571 --> 13:45.074
- He doesn't.
That's what I'm saying.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.867
He's just stuffing
the bags with them

13:46.951 --> 13:51.288
to pull a fast one
over St. Louis!

13:51.372 --> 13:55.626
- Are you saying it's illegal to
own that many Styrofoam balls?

13:55.709 --> 13:58.003
- Uh, no.

13:58.087 --> 14:01.006
Look, maybe I'm not
explaining this well.

14:01.090 --> 14:04.552
Look, this is
fake garbage, guys.

14:04.635 --> 14:06.345
Here's what he's doing--
- Pastor Ballentine!

14:06.428 --> 14:08.847
{\an3}Pastor Ballentine, you are
trespassing on city property.

14:08.931 --> 14:10.266
Arrest this man.

14:10.349 --> 14:12.351
{\an3}I have no intention
of letting you incite a riot.

14:12.434 --> 14:15.938
- Well, I have no intention of
leaving before I say my piece.

14:16.021 --> 14:16.939
crowd: Yeah!

14:17.022 --> 14:18.107
- Okay, fine.

14:18.190 --> 14:20.776
{\an1}Officers, set your Tasers
to stun.

14:20.859 --> 14:22.069
- It's a Taser.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.779
That's all they do.

14:23.862 --> 14:25.281
- Great.
Then Tase away.

14:25.364 --> 14:30.703
- You know, you can arrest me,
but you cannot arrest the truth.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.954
[all cheering]

14:32.037 --> 14:34.790
- Fine, then I'll settle
for just you.

14:34.873 --> 14:37.251
{\an1}- Boyce!
We got the garbage.

14:37.334 --> 14:39.336
- Whew! I was starting
to be worried for a second.

14:39.420 --> 14:41.964
- Curtis' car broke down,
and we had to take a Uber.

14:42.047 --> 14:44.133
Uber people don't like you
putting trash in their car.

14:44.216 --> 14:46.218
{\an3}- Mrs. Ballentine, if you want
to talk to your husband,

14:46.302 --> 14:48.971
{\an3}you're gonna have to wait
for visitation hours.

14:49.054 --> 14:50.889
Take them away.
- No, wait!

14:50.973 --> 14:53.517
This is Mayor Saxby's garbage

14:53.601 --> 14:55.978
that he dumped
far away from his house

14:56.061 --> 14:57.271
in a poor,
poor neighborhood.

14:57.354 --> 15:01.483
{\an1}- Yeah, a poor neighborhood
that only just got a Rite Aid!

15:01.567 --> 15:03.527
- You can make
any claim you want,

15:03.611 --> 15:05.154
but you can't prove
any of this.

15:05.237 --> 15:08.949
{\an1}- It's all on my Instagram.
I took pictures and posted it.

15:09.033 --> 15:13.162
Oh. My username
is LolliSoFly_1.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.915
Feel free to like,
share, and comment.

15:16.999 --> 15:20.502
- Now, let's just take a look at
Mayor Saxby's "garbage," huh?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.504
- Oh, come on. This is nonsense.
Get them out of here.

15:22.588 --> 15:24.131
{\an3}- Let's see where
he's going with this.

15:24.214 --> 15:25.674
- That could
be anybody's trash!

15:25.758 --> 15:28.260
- Oh!
Take a look...

15:28.344 --> 15:33.015
at all the chicken
left on these bones.

15:33.098 --> 15:36.435
Y'all know this
is white-people garbage!

15:36.518 --> 15:39.313
- Smoking gun.

15:39.396 --> 15:42.066
- Whoa, whoa, whoa. I'm not the
only white person in St. Louis.

15:42.149 --> 15:43.442
- Right, right.

15:43.525 --> 15:48.530
How about this? "Touch of Gray"
men's hair coloring...

15:49.990 --> 15:50.574
A perfect match.

15:50.658 --> 15:53.035
- Smoking gun.

15:53.118 --> 15:56.622
- Please, please. You cannot get
color like this from a box.

15:56.705 --> 15:59.708
- Well, what do we have here?

15:59.792 --> 16:02.753
"Sailing Enthusiast Magazine,"

16:02.836 --> 16:07.383
addressed to one Ron Saxby!

16:08.967 --> 16:10.177
{\an1}- Stamps!

16:10.260 --> 16:11.887
- Oh, I'm sorry.
I got a text.

16:11.970 --> 16:12.429
Smoking gun.

16:12.513 --> 16:15.557
all: Yeah!

16:15.641 --> 16:17.726
{\an3}- All right, clearly,
mistakes were made.

16:17.810 --> 16:18.769
{\an3}Hey, hey!

16:18.852 --> 16:20.020
Now, that was not necessary!

16:20.104 --> 16:22.981
{\an3}Officer, arrest
whoever just threw that.

16:23.065 --> 16:24.566
- Go to hell, Saxby!

16:24.650 --> 16:26.527
all: Yeah!

16:28.362 --> 16:29.363
- Oh!
- Get him! Get him!

16:29.446 --> 16:32.116
{\an3}- Stop this!
Come on, that was a diaper!

16:32.199 --> 16:35.244
[all shouting]

16:36.161 --> 16:37.746
- Okay.
Hey, listen up!

16:37.830 --> 16:38.956
Listen, everybody.

16:39.039 --> 16:42.751
[musical horn honking]

16:42.835 --> 16:45.921
Guys, everybody calm down.

16:46.004 --> 16:48.590
Come on.
We're better than this.

16:48.674 --> 16:51.135
Now, sure, he came down here
to bully us,

16:51.218 --> 16:53.595
but we're not gonna stoop
to his level, all right?

16:53.679 --> 16:57.516
Besides, this man is about
to give us everything we want

16:57.599 --> 16:58.934
to end this strike.

16:59.017 --> 17:00.602
Am I right, Mr. Mayor?

17:00.686 --> 17:01.603
- Yeah, yeah, sure.

17:01.687 --> 17:02.604
{\an3}We'll sit down
next week, okay?

17:02.688 --> 17:05.273
[all groaning]

17:05.357 --> 17:06.442
- How does right now sound?

17:06.525 --> 17:10.194

Right now, right now, right now!

17:10.279 --> 17:11.405

17:11.488 --> 17:12.614

right now's good.

Right now, right now, right now!

Right now, right now, right now!

{\an8}<i>after photos surface online</i>

17:25.377 --> 17:27.253
{\an8}<i>showing him</i>
<i>and his staff members</i>

17:27.337 --> 17:29.423
{\an8}<i>dumping his household waste</i>

17:29.506 --> 17:32.468
{\an8}-<i> The bottom line is,</i>
<i>the garbage strike is over.</i>

17:32.551 --> 17:34.970
{\an8}<i>It's time for the citizens</i>
<i>of St. Louis to move forward</i>

17:35.053 --> 17:37.806
{\an8}<i>and to please stop throwing</i>

17:37.890 --> 17:41.143
{\an8}<i>I mean, seriously.</i>
<i>Hey!</i>

17:41.226 --> 17:42.728
{\an8}[all laughing]

17:42.811 --> 17:44.188
{\an8}<i>I am the mayor!</i>

17:47.733 --> 17:49.401
{\an8}<i>Still the mayor!</i>

17:51.069 --> 17:53.155
- Yes!
We did it, you guys!

17:53.238 --> 17:55.115
- Yes, we did. Yeah.
- We did it, babe!

17:55.199 --> 17:56.241
- And the news
is calling you a hero.

17:56.325 --> 17:58.994
{\an3}- Oh, "hero's"
a pretty strong word.

17:59.077 --> 18:01.789
Maybe "problem-solver,"

18:01.872 --> 18:05.042
"bringer of justice,"

18:05.125 --> 18:06.460
"breaker of chains"...

18:06.543 --> 18:09.171
{\an3}I mean, we don't have to
label it, you know.

18:10.422 --> 18:12.591
- Stamps, we're celebrating.

18:12.674 --> 18:14.343
{\an1}Why don't you take a break
from calling donors?

18:14.426 --> 18:16.136
{\an3}- I'm not calling them.
They're calling us.

18:16.220 --> 18:17.846
{\an3}I mean, there's
so many calls coming in,

18:17.930 --> 18:19.306
I got Curtis helping me.

18:19.389 --> 18:22.434
{\an3}- $1,000?
You got $1,000 sitting around,

18:22.518 --> 18:24.186
and you just want
to give it to him?

18:24.269 --> 18:27.189
{\an3}You don't even know
if he gonna win!

18:27.272 --> 18:28.690
- Curtis, take the money!

18:28.774 --> 18:31.360
- All right, dude.

18:31.443 --> 18:34.363
{\an1}- Stamps, Virginia?
I need an answer.

18:34.446 --> 18:36.323
{\an3}- Well, here's
what I've decided.

18:36.406 --> 18:39.451
Sometimes you got to get
out of your comfort zone

18:39.535 --> 18:40.661
and take a leap of faith.

18:40.744 --> 18:43.205
{\an1}- I need an answer,
not a fortune cookie.

18:43.288 --> 18:45.457
{\an3}- That is the answer.
I'm in!

18:45.541 --> 18:47.751
{\an3}Just give me a minute
so I can tell my family.

18:49.002 --> 18:50.212
- Hey, Boyce.

18:50.295 --> 18:52.047
{\an1}Sounds like I missed
a good one last night.

18:52.130 --> 18:53.382
- Yes, you did, Dad.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.883
{\an1}- Well, I was swamped
at the church.

18:54.967 --> 18:57.636
{\an1}I had to lead Bible study,
do a counseling session,

18:57.719 --> 18:59.555
and write a new sermon.

18:59.638 --> 19:01.223
- And I'm sure you
left one on my desk

19:01.306 --> 19:01.849
to show me how it's done.

19:01.932 --> 19:03.141
- No, I didn't.

19:03.225 --> 19:05.519
{\an1}For your information,
Stamps showed me

19:05.602 --> 19:06.854
{\an1}how to put it
on a email.

19:06.937 --> 19:08.146
{\an3}- [laughs]

19:08.230 --> 19:09.857
{\an3}All right,
well, thanks, Dad.

19:09.940 --> 19:11.275
- Hey, guys.
Listen, okay?

19:11.358 --> 19:12.651
Now, I got some great news.

19:12.734 --> 19:14.778
{\an1}Now, I was thinking about--
maybe it's time--

19:14.862 --> 19:16.238
- Barton, are you okay?

19:16.321 --> 19:17.739
{\an1}- Whoa.
What's going on?

19:17.823 --> 19:19.324
- Oh.
Ah, nothing.

19:19.408 --> 19:22.578
I'm fine. I just lost my breath
there for a second.

19:22.661 --> 19:24.496
- What's wrong, Daddy?
- Nothing.

19:24.580 --> 19:26.874
This has been happening
the last few days.

19:26.957 --> 19:29.293
It'll pass in a minute.

19:29.376 --> 19:30.752
- Okay. No.
No, no, no.

19:30.836 --> 19:32.337
No, you going to the hospital.
- Right now.

19:32.421 --> 19:33.755
I'll get the car.
- Nonsense!

19:33.839 --> 19:35.924
{\an3}- Oh, Barton,
please, just go for us.

19:36.008 --> 19:38.760
- Fine, for you.
- Come on, now.

19:38.844 --> 19:41.054
- But I'm driving.

19:41.138 --> 19:43.015
Ooh.
Son, you better drive.

19:43.098 --> 19:44.349
{\an1}- Yeah.

19:45.934 --> 19:50.355
- So, since you got thousands
of dollars laying around,

19:50.439 --> 19:52.441
you think you could
let me hold some?

19:56.320 --> 19:57.946
- Wow!
