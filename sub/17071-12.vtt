WEBVTT

00:02.270 --> 00:04.672
Okay, so, Eddie chose
 Moesha on Tuesday,

00:04.705 --> 00:06.140
and then on Wednesday
we'll watch...

00:06.174 --> 00:07.975
-Wings.
-Come on, dude!

00:08.007 --> 00:10.411
We divide the TV schedule
evenly and fairly.

00:10.444 --> 00:13.414
And Thomas Haden Church
is hilarious.

00:13.447 --> 00:15.216
Boys, I did
a little reorganizing,

00:15.249 --> 00:17.685
and not to brag,
but the pantry looks incredible.

00:17.718 --> 00:19.487
You know how Mom is
about that space.

00:19.520 --> 00:21.522
It's her spiritual
sanctuary.

00:21.555 --> 00:23.857
-Dead man walking.
-Oh, you guys are wrong.

00:23.891 --> 00:25.359
She's gonna love
the changes to the pantry.

00:25.393 --> 00:26.760
What about the pantry?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.329
See for yourself.

00:28.362 --> 00:32.766
**

00:32.800 --> 00:34.102
Louis, you're a genius.

00:34.135 --> 00:35.169
(chuckles)

00:35.203 --> 00:37.405
The bulk items have never
been more accessible.

00:37.438 --> 00:39.973
And the canned goods are
organized by expiration date.

00:41.575 --> 00:42.843
Kiss ass.

00:42.876 --> 00:44.112
What was that?

00:44.145 --> 00:46.480
(smooching)

00:49.917 --> 00:51.719
Another postcard
from Connie.

00:52.786 --> 00:55.923
"Dear Jessica, having
a great time in Ithaca.

00:55.956 --> 00:57.958
Hope things are well
with you.

00:57.991 --> 00:59.760
Love, Connie."

00:59.793 --> 01:00.794
Hmm.

01:00.828 --> 01:02.230
Ithaca, New York.

01:02.263 --> 01:03.897
Bloomington, Indiana.

01:03.931 --> 01:05.366
Athens, Georgia.

01:05.399 --> 01:07.868
Why is she going
to all these amazing places?

01:07.901 --> 01:11.905
Well, we all can't afford to
travel as much as Connie does.

01:11.939 --> 01:13.641
I have responsibilities.

01:13.674 --> 01:15.543
I can't just leave
whenever I want to.

01:15.576 --> 01:16.610
I mean,
do I think about it?

01:16.644 --> 01:19.046
Of course I do.
All the time.

01:19.079 --> 01:20.714
It would be so easy. I would
just get a pair of glasses,

01:20.748 --> 01:24.084
buy a leather jacket,
and roll my own cigarettes.

01:25.286 --> 01:28.088
But I would never do that

01:28.122 --> 01:29.590
because I am an adult.

01:29.623 --> 01:33.127
I'm gonna get down
to the bottom of this.

01:33.161 --> 01:34.728
(telephone rings)

01:34.762 --> 01:36.130
Sister.

01:36.164 --> 01:38.432
So nice to hear from you.

01:38.466 --> 01:41.635
How are things?

01:41.669 --> 01:43.237
I've been
visiting colleges.

01:43.271 --> 01:44.572
Already?

01:44.605 --> 01:46.440
But Justin is only
in the ninth grade.

01:46.474 --> 01:49.277
Even I think that's too early
to be visiting colleges.

01:49.310 --> 01:52.613
Oh, it's not for Justin.
It's for me.

01:52.646 --> 01:55.015
I'm going back to school.

02:00.020 --> 02:01.255
* Fresh off the boat

02:01.289 --> 02:03.023
* I'm gettin' mine
everywhere I go *

02:03.056 --> 02:05.259
* If you don't know, homey,
now you know *

02:05.293 --> 02:06.494
* Fresh off the boat

02:06.527 --> 02:08.696
* Homey, you don't know
where I come from *

02:08.729 --> 02:10.298
* But I know where I'm goin'

02:10.330 --> 02:13.133
* I'm fresh off the boat

02:19.207 --> 02:22.310
My name is Samantha de la Cruz,

02:22.343 --> 02:26.380
and I would like to buy
a one-way ticket to Marrakesh,

02:26.414 --> 02:27.548
smoking section.

02:27.581 --> 02:28.649
Hey, Jessica.

02:28.682 --> 02:31.719
Nothing.
I'm just setting the table.

02:31.752 --> 02:33.954
Ooh.
The fancy napkins.

02:33.987 --> 02:34.822
Did someone die?

02:34.855 --> 02:36.357
No. Connie's coming,
remember,

02:36.390 --> 02:38.392
to visit college campuses
in the area?

02:38.426 --> 02:40.027
Classic Connie.

02:40.060 --> 02:41.829
We'd all love
to go back to school,

02:41.862 --> 02:43.831
audit a German class,
get good at beer pong,

02:43.864 --> 02:44.965
but we are adults.

02:44.998 --> 02:45.966
We have responsibilities.

02:45.999 --> 02:48.402
I support Connie 100%.

02:48.436 --> 02:50.137
Me too.
She's so brave, you know?

02:50.170 --> 02:51.339
None of us have the guts.

02:51.372 --> 02:52.873
It's just such
a big step for her.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.208
Connie never
went to college,

02:54.242 --> 02:56.244
unless you count beauty school,
which nobody does.

02:56.277 --> 02:59.079
She'll be able to get a degree,
get a great job,

02:59.112 --> 03:01.048
provide for her family
without having to rely

03:01.081 --> 03:03.083
on her husband
for financial support.

03:03.116 --> 03:04.518
Steve does love
the ponies...

03:04.552 --> 03:06.420
and the doggies
and the roosters.

03:06.454 --> 03:09.156
She's finally taking
control of her life.

03:09.189 --> 03:10.358
If you think about it,

03:10.391 --> 03:12.660
Connie is trying
to be more like me.

03:12.693 --> 03:14.562
(sighs) Respect.

03:14.595 --> 03:15.696
(doorbell rings)

03:17.465 --> 03:18.766
Hello, Jessica.

03:18.799 --> 03:22.002
Hello, Louis.

03:22.035 --> 03:24.338
Connie.

03:24.372 --> 03:26.707
Welcome.

03:26.740 --> 03:28.942
I'm so glad to see you.

03:30.744 --> 03:32.580
Yes, come in.
Come in.

03:32.613 --> 03:34.114
(door closes)

03:34.147 --> 03:36.484
Thanks so much
for having me.

03:38.786 --> 03:41.289
I have to say,
I just think it's great

03:41.322 --> 03:43.524
that you're going to college,
Connie.

03:43.557 --> 03:45.259
I'm proud of you,
big sister.

03:45.293 --> 03:46.527
Really?

03:46.560 --> 03:47.728
Yes!

03:47.761 --> 03:49.963
Let me know
what I can do to help.

03:49.997 --> 03:53.133
In college, I took notes
for a blind student.

03:53.166 --> 03:55.603
She said they were the best
she'd ever gotten.

03:55.636 --> 03:59.607
W-Well, maybe you can come with
me on a campus tour tomorrow.

03:59.640 --> 04:01.742
Yes!
I would love to do that!

04:01.775 --> 04:04.144
The key is color-coding
when you take notes.

04:04.177 --> 04:05.112
Free tip.

04:05.145 --> 04:06.380
Uh, I'm working,

04:06.414 --> 04:07.648
so we have to figure out
what to do with the boys

04:07.681 --> 04:08.949
since Ma's out of town.

04:08.982 --> 04:10.250
Oh, where's
Grandma Huang?

04:10.284 --> 04:12.386
She's visiting friends
in Tallahassee.

04:12.420 --> 04:14.254
Her "friends"
are Seminole Indians,

04:14.288 --> 04:17.291
and "Tallahassee" is a small
casino next to a swamp.

04:17.325 --> 04:18.926
Honey and Marvin said
they would take care of the boys

04:18.959 --> 04:20.060
any time we needed.

04:20.093 --> 04:22.095
You can stay in Grandma's room.
Come on.

04:22.129 --> 04:25.433
I'll show you what I want to do
with it when she...moves.

04:26.834 --> 04:28.101
* You wonder why *

04:28.135 --> 04:29.269
* You wonder why *

04:29.303 --> 04:30.103
* Maybe God *

04:30.137 --> 04:31.271
* Maybe God *

04:31.305 --> 04:33.441
The Color Purple
is so emotional.

04:33.474 --> 04:36.477
When Miss Millie wouldn't
let Sofia go see her son?

04:36.510 --> 04:38.078
On Christmas!

04:38.111 --> 04:39.179
What kind of animals?

04:39.212 --> 04:42.115
What...kind...of animals?

04:42.149 --> 04:43.150
I would have quit, too.

04:43.183 --> 04:44.485
She had no choice.

04:44.518 --> 04:46.253
The Color Purple.

04:46.286 --> 04:47.788
More like
 The Color of White Cruelty.
Mm-hmm.

04:47.821 --> 04:49.523
Oh, this is
my favorite part.
Me too!

04:49.557 --> 04:51.191
* Maybe *
* Maybe *

04:51.224 --> 04:52.793
* God is *
* God is *

04:52.826 --> 04:54.194
* Trying *
* Trying *

04:54.227 --> 04:55.996
* To tell you something *

04:56.029 --> 04:57.197
I'll go high.
You go low.

04:57.230 --> 04:59.099
* Maybe *
* God is *

04:59.132 --> 05:00.434
* God is *
* Trying *

05:00.468 --> 05:02.269
* Trying *
* To tell you something *

05:02.302 --> 05:05.773
Oh, such a strong alto
for such a petite frame.

05:05.806 --> 05:07.475
We are so good!

05:07.508 --> 05:08.442
* Tell you *

05:08.476 --> 05:10.511
* To tell you something,
 ooh *

05:10.544 --> 05:12.946
EDDIE: This is what a dog
must feel like all the time!

05:12.980 --> 05:14.815
Life is truly a wonder.

05:14.848 --> 05:17.485
I'm eating bugs,
and I don't care!

05:17.518 --> 05:19.520
(chuckles)
(chuckles)

05:19.553 --> 05:22.356
Well, I have
a fun day planned.

05:22.390 --> 05:24.291
You all ready?
-Yeah!

05:24.324 --> 05:25.826
Marvin didn't even tell me
what we're doing.

05:25.859 --> 05:28.328
(both chuckle)

05:28.362 --> 05:29.563
Ahh.

05:31.331 --> 05:33.967
An old-folks home?
Are we visiting someone?

05:34.001 --> 05:36.336
In a manner
of speaking, yes.

05:36.370 --> 05:38.005
We're visiting
our future home.

05:38.038 --> 05:39.540
(laughs)

05:39.573 --> 05:41.809
You -- You want us
to move in here?

05:41.842 --> 05:43.577
Well,
not for a while yet.

05:43.611 --> 05:44.912
Two, maybe three years.

05:44.945 --> 05:47.147
But I'm 28.

05:47.180 --> 05:48.416
Whoa!
A limousine!

05:48.449 --> 05:51.985
Hi. Hi.

05:52.019 --> 05:54.555
(sighs)
This takes me back.

05:54.588 --> 05:56.690
The smell
of higher education,

05:56.724 --> 05:59.693
the crack of a ramen brick
over a steaming-hot plate.

05:59.727 --> 06:02.229
Uh-huh.

06:02.262 --> 06:03.731
Oh, wow.

06:03.764 --> 06:06.366
Hey, look at their
skinny briefcases.

06:06.400 --> 06:09.403
Must be the hot new style
in business.

06:10.604 --> 06:13.340
And I didn't realize
this was a women's college.

06:13.373 --> 06:15.208
Those are
art portfolios.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.444
That's a man.

06:18.779 --> 06:19.747
A man?

06:19.780 --> 06:21.281
A creative man.

06:21.314 --> 06:23.551
This is the Orlando School
of Art and Design.

06:23.584 --> 06:24.552
What?

06:24.585 --> 06:25.786
This is art school.

06:25.819 --> 06:27.888
I'm studying
to be an artist.

06:28.989 --> 06:30.524
Ohhhh.

06:30.558 --> 06:32.125
(chuckles)

06:38.466 --> 06:40.568
I'm Janet. I'll be
your student tour guide

06:40.601 --> 06:42.369
or, as I like
to think of myself,

06:42.402 --> 06:44.371
your creative-journey
chaperone.

06:44.404 --> 06:46.607
We're being led around
by a lunatic.

06:46.640 --> 06:49.209
Our first stop will be
the student center.

06:49.242 --> 06:50.243
Built back in 1945...

06:50.277 --> 06:51.979
Why would you go
to college for art?

06:52.012 --> 06:53.814
Since when do you care
about painting?

06:53.847 --> 06:56.450
I didn't until
a few months ago.

06:56.484 --> 06:59.252
But then Steve and I got
into a fight, and I was upset,

06:59.286 --> 07:00.954
so I went to
the National Gallery of Art

07:00.988 --> 07:03.056
because they have a good
hot dog vendor outside.

07:03.090 --> 07:04.157
Mm-hmm.
I was getting relish

07:04.191 --> 07:07.427
when I saw a banner
for the Vermeer exhibit.

07:08.696 --> 07:12.500
(voice breaking)
It's so...so moving.

07:12.533 --> 07:14.468
(footsteps approaching)

07:14.502 --> 07:16.069
Ma'am, there's no food
allowed inside the museum.

07:16.103 --> 07:17.671
Oh.

07:24.444 --> 07:26.514
(sobs)

07:27.848 --> 07:31.018
Vermeer not only captured
daily Dutch life in the 1600s,

07:31.051 --> 07:33.754
but also my mood that day.

07:33.787 --> 07:35.088
Mm.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.256
After that,
I got inspired to paint,

07:36.289 --> 07:39.426
and, turns out, I'm pretty good
at it, so here we are.

07:39.459 --> 07:40.528
JANET: All of the artists

07:40.561 --> 07:42.663
sit on the ground
among the leaves or...

07:42.696 --> 07:46.199
Keep your handbag close.
There's a magician at 10:00.

07:46.233 --> 07:47.635
-Oh, Dean Edwards.
-Janet.

07:47.668 --> 07:51.138
"This world is (sighs)

07:51.171 --> 07:54.207
but a canvas
to our imaginations."

07:54.241 --> 07:56.309
Henry David Thoreau.

07:57.711 --> 07:58.546
What?

07:58.579 --> 08:00.113
Enjoy the rest of the tour.

08:00.147 --> 08:03.116
Dean Edwards runs our weekly
free-expression village.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.117
You should all come.

08:04.151 --> 08:06.219
It's a safe space
for students

08:06.253 --> 08:07.988
to express
their creative selves

08:08.021 --> 08:10.223
through a wide range
of mediums.

08:10.257 --> 08:14.327
There's no safe space from
your parents' disappointment.

08:14.361 --> 08:16.997
Yeah.
Think about that.

08:17.030 --> 08:19.332
Oh, isn't it great?

08:19.366 --> 08:22.169
It's like an all-inclusive
land cruise

08:22.202 --> 08:23.637
for the rest of our lives.

08:23.671 --> 08:25.472
You want us
to move in here?

08:25.505 --> 08:27.474
Hopefully.
We're on the wait list.

08:27.507 --> 08:29.810
We need some folks to cash in
their chips first,

08:29.843 --> 08:32.813
buy the farm, you know,
take the trip up north.

08:32.846 --> 08:34.147
Marvin, I'm not --

08:34.181 --> 08:35.215
Whoa!
They've got a Ping-Pong table,

08:35.248 --> 08:38.986
board games, shuffleboard,
and even a pudding bar.

08:39.019 --> 08:41.087
Don't forget love.

08:42.455 --> 08:44.256
I bet those two
have stories.

08:44.291 --> 08:46.259
Oh, I'm sure they do.

08:46.293 --> 08:48.028
All the people here
are top-notch.

08:48.061 --> 08:49.196
This is the best place
in the state.

08:49.229 --> 08:52.532
Honey, take a look around.
See what you think.

08:53.601 --> 08:54.534
(sighs)

08:54.568 --> 08:57.738
Okay. Sure.
Can't hurt to look.

08:57.771 --> 08:58.739
(laughs)

09:01.241 --> 09:04.344
Dinner's at 4:00!
I love this place!

09:04.377 --> 09:05.713
(birds chirping)

09:07.615 --> 09:08.849
Look at her,

09:08.882 --> 09:11.585
just painting without any cares
in the world.

09:11.619 --> 09:13.621
LOUIS: It's nice you're being
so supportive.

09:13.654 --> 09:16.123
She's really in her element.
It's wonderful.

09:16.156 --> 09:18.358
Wonderful?
She's wasting her time.

09:18.391 --> 09:21.595
But I thought you were happy
she was going back to school.

09:21.629 --> 09:23.964
School?
That's what she calls it.

09:23.997 --> 09:26.566
I call it
a hippie birdbath.

09:26.600 --> 09:28.035
I can't keep up.

09:28.068 --> 09:30.804
Oh, Jessica, do you have
any scrap fabric lying around?

09:30.838 --> 09:32.539
I want to make a collage.

09:32.572 --> 09:34.041
I don't, but if I did,
I would use it

09:34.074 --> 09:36.543
for something practical,
like rags.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.279
And there's
my real sister.

09:39.312 --> 09:40.948
I was wondering
where you went.

09:40.981 --> 09:42.582
I just don't understand

09:42.616 --> 09:44.384
why you would waste your time
on art school.

09:44.417 --> 09:46.119
Do you really think
you're gonna make a living

09:46.153 --> 09:47.487
selling your paintings?

09:47.520 --> 09:49.056
I'm not going to school
to make money.

09:49.089 --> 09:51.792
(scoffs) I'm doing it
for personal enrichment.

09:51.825 --> 09:53.994
Sounds like a waste
of the word "rich."

09:54.027 --> 09:56.463
I knew you couldn't actually
be happy for me.

09:56.496 --> 09:58.298
Well, I don't
need your approval.

09:58.331 --> 10:01.401
I'm going to the fabric store
to buy supplies.

10:01.434 --> 10:04.504
Let me know if you need
any zippers or threads
or glitter pens!

10:04.537 --> 10:05.906
(sighs)

10:05.939 --> 10:08.341
(indistinct conversations)

10:08.375 --> 10:11.144
Lillian, look at
these two cuties.
(gasps, laughs)

10:11.178 --> 10:13.080
Such sweet faces.

10:13.113 --> 10:15.282
I wish I could just
put them in my pocket.

10:15.315 --> 10:16.750
Don't look them
in the eye.

10:16.784 --> 10:19.486
We'll be here all day, so maybe
we'll run into you later.

10:19.519 --> 10:20.688
What are you doing?!

10:20.721 --> 10:22.155
What are you talking about?

10:22.189 --> 10:24.457
Ain't you a livin' doll?

10:24.491 --> 10:26.093
You're so cute.

10:26.126 --> 10:27.594
Ooh!
Like a chipmunk.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.297
Chippy, chippy, chippy!

10:30.330 --> 10:32.032
You did this to us!

10:32.065 --> 10:33.500
(both laugh)

10:33.533 --> 10:35.669
Hi. Welcome.
You must be Mr. McManus.

10:35.703 --> 10:37.537
It says here
you have a cat

10:37.570 --> 10:39.106
and you don't like
to be touched.

10:39.139 --> 10:40.240
Is that right?

10:40.273 --> 10:42.275
Don't worry. We're gonna take
good care of your dad.

10:42.309 --> 10:44.878
(laughs)

10:44.912 --> 10:46.680
Oh, this guy.

10:46.714 --> 10:48.682
Are the other doctors
as funny as you?

10:48.716 --> 10:49.549
I'm a nurse.

10:49.582 --> 10:52.052
A male nurse?
You can't stop this guy.

10:52.085 --> 10:54.321
He's got a million of them.
(laughs)

10:54.354 --> 10:56.056
He's not Mr. McManus.
(chuckling) No.

10:56.089 --> 10:57.825
We just signed up
for the day passes.

10:57.858 --> 10:59.359
Oh, got it.
Oh, well, here you go.

10:59.392 --> 11:01.461
Uh, why don't you
keep these on you

11:01.494 --> 11:03.563
so we know you're
approved guests?

11:03.596 --> 11:05.398
What does
"Do not resuscitate" mean?

11:05.432 --> 11:06.800
Oh, sorry. Wrong ones.

11:06.834 --> 11:09.970
**

11:10.003 --> 11:12.472
New open house?

11:12.505 --> 11:13.640
Oh, two and a half baths.
Nice.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.810
I'm counting the water-heater
closet as a half-bathroom.

11:16.844 --> 11:17.811
Well, that's why
you're the best.

11:17.845 --> 11:22.215
No, I'm the best
because I work hard...

11:22.249 --> 11:25.585
because that is what
responsible adults do.

11:25.618 --> 11:28.856
They don't waste their time
making collages.

11:28.889 --> 11:31.091
Look, I get that
you don't agree with it,

11:31.124 --> 11:32.225
but it's Connie's life.

11:32.259 --> 11:33.526
She can do what she wants.

11:33.560 --> 11:34.694
I should have known better

11:34.728 --> 11:36.329
than to think that
Connie could change.

11:36.363 --> 11:38.365
She's just as irresponsible
as ever.

11:38.398 --> 11:40.100
Art school?

11:40.133 --> 11:42.770
Two nonsense words
that don't even belong together.

11:42.803 --> 11:45.072
It's like "tire lemon."

11:45.105 --> 11:46.774
Or "pistachio belt."

11:46.807 --> 11:48.675
No. See?
Now, that makes sense to me.

11:48.708 --> 11:50.744
It's an easy way
to snack on the go.

11:50.778 --> 11:54.581
I just wish they made
pistachio belts!

11:54.614 --> 11:57.484
I'm sorry. I just don't get
why it's such a big deal.

11:59.652 --> 12:00.553
(sighs)

12:00.587 --> 12:03.023
Ugh. Ew. Ah.

12:03.056 --> 12:04.557
Why are we in the back
of the garage?

12:04.591 --> 12:05.859
This is the spiders' land.

12:05.893 --> 12:07.560
We don't go into their home,
they don't come into ours.

12:07.594 --> 12:09.129
Ugh! I'm sorry!
Get off me!

12:09.162 --> 12:11.198
Louis, I have to
show you something.

12:11.231 --> 12:13.133
Please don't think
less of me.

12:17.570 --> 12:19.239
Old paintings?

12:19.272 --> 12:21.141
Jessica, let's just
get out of here.

12:21.174 --> 12:22.709
I don't have a good feeling
about this.

12:22.742 --> 12:23.944
I painted them.

12:23.977 --> 12:25.712
What?

12:25.745 --> 12:26.947
You paint?

12:26.980 --> 12:29.616
I used to...every day.

12:29.649 --> 12:32.419
This one
is called Bagel.

12:32.452 --> 12:34.387
This is Seashell,

12:34.421 --> 12:36.756
Horse and Foal,

12:36.790 --> 12:40.060
Unemployed Virgin,

12:40.093 --> 12:42.595
Avocados Resting in Bowl,

12:42.629 --> 12:46.499
Timothy
 Looks at Rebecca...

12:46.533 --> 12:48.668
Zebra and Giraffe,

12:48.701 --> 12:51.138
Zebra in Top Hat,

12:51.171 --> 12:53.406
Zebra in Shorts,

12:53.440 --> 12:54.474
Dan Quayle.

12:54.507 --> 12:57.344
(Engine shuts off,
car door closes)

12:57.377 --> 12:58.511
What's all this?

12:58.545 --> 13:00.814
My paintings, Connie.

13:02.315 --> 13:04.017
I love to paint, too,

13:04.051 --> 13:07.254
long before your hot dogs
and Girl With Pearl Earring.

13:07.287 --> 13:09.389
Why didn't you tell me
about this?

13:10.457 --> 13:11.524
Are you jealous?

13:11.558 --> 13:13.460
Why would I be jealous?

13:13.493 --> 13:16.763
Because you quit your dream
and I'm living mine.

13:16.796 --> 13:18.131
No.

13:18.165 --> 13:21.034
I love painting, but I gave
it up before I went to college

13:21.068 --> 13:24.304
because I knew
I had to grow up
and get serious.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.839
And that's what
you should do, too.

13:25.873 --> 13:29.642
I'm not giving up painting.
It's my passion.

13:29.676 --> 13:31.278
Guys,
we're all sisters here.

13:31.311 --> 13:32.779
Now let's just get
out of the spider den,

13:32.812 --> 13:33.847
crack open some wine --

13:33.881 --> 13:36.649
Passion? Who has time
to pursue a passion?

13:36.683 --> 13:38.785
I make time because
it makes me happy

13:38.818 --> 13:41.321
and helps me be better in
all the other parts of my life.

13:41.354 --> 13:43.857
It doesn't make you better.
It makes you selfish.

13:43.891 --> 13:46.193
Your family should come first,
Connie.

13:46.226 --> 13:48.028
Do you even know
where your son is?

13:48.061 --> 13:50.197
Where is he?
Where is he, Connie?

13:50.230 --> 13:52.332
With his father,
most likely at Brookstone

13:52.365 --> 13:54.167
checking out
a high-tech aquarium!

13:54.201 --> 13:56.203
(sighs)

14:00.908 --> 14:03.010
* I'm just hangin' out *

14:03.043 --> 14:04.811
* Hangin' out *

14:04.844 --> 14:06.413
(laughs)

14:07.580 --> 14:09.016
Whoa!

14:09.049 --> 14:10.350
* Hangin' out *

14:12.352 --> 14:14.254
* I'm just hangin' out *

14:14.287 --> 14:15.188
* Hangin' out *

14:15.222 --> 14:17.590
(laughter)

14:17.624 --> 14:18.791
* Hangin' out *

14:19.893 --> 14:21.594
* Hangin' out *

14:24.697 --> 14:27.534
It hurts.
It hurts to smile.

14:27.567 --> 14:28.535
Honey?

14:28.568 --> 14:29.569
EMERY:
Why are you running?

14:29.602 --> 14:31.771
I'm 28.
I can run at any moment.

14:31.804 --> 14:33.840
You're running barefoot
like a bum in a hurry.

14:33.873 --> 14:36.076
That's what we
young people do, Evan.

14:36.109 --> 14:39.379
We run because we have
our whole lives ahead of us.

14:39.412 --> 14:41.548
Do you think you should
slow down a little?

14:41.581 --> 14:42.615
Slow down?

14:42.649 --> 14:45.052
(scoffs)
No. I'm gonna slow up.

14:45.085 --> 14:47.020
(beeping)
That's what I'm gonna do.

14:47.054 --> 14:50.390
(breathing heavily)

14:50.423 --> 14:51.891
Aah! Ugh! Aaaah!

14:53.093 --> 14:54.261
(winces)
(gasps)

14:54.294 --> 14:55.996
My hip!

14:59.399 --> 15:01.634
What are you doing?

15:01.668 --> 15:03.103
It's time
to get rid of these.

15:03.136 --> 15:04.604
I don't know why I kept them
in the first place.

15:04.637 --> 15:07.107
They're terrible.
No!

15:07.140 --> 15:08.441
This is a great one.

15:08.475 --> 15:10.277
What a beautiful kangaroo.

15:10.310 --> 15:13.713
It's The Resurrection
 of Christ.

15:13.746 --> 15:14.982
Yeah. Of course it is.

15:15.015 --> 15:16.649
Louis, you don't
have to pretend.

15:16.683 --> 15:18.385
I know they're not good.

15:18.418 --> 15:19.919
Okay.
They're not great.

15:19.953 --> 15:22.289
It doesn't matter.
You should still paint.

15:22.322 --> 15:24.291
It's a hobby, and the great
thing about hobbies is,

15:24.324 --> 15:25.458
you don't have to
be good at them.

15:25.492 --> 15:26.960
You just have to
enjoy them.

15:26.994 --> 15:29.329
Hobbies?
That's ridiculous.

15:29.362 --> 15:31.731
I only focus on
practical things.

15:31.764 --> 15:34.301
You've seen
my morning affirmations.

15:37.370 --> 15:41.308
I can't afford hobbies.
I have work and this family.

15:41.341 --> 15:44.111
Well, I have work and this
family, and I have hobbies --

15:44.144 --> 15:47.414
uh, pool, chili, tennis,
the clarinet.

15:47.447 --> 15:50.117
Clarinet?
I'm a sucker for
a distinctive timbre.

15:50.150 --> 15:52.419
Can you imagine trying
to explain to our parents

15:52.452 --> 15:54.021
the idea of hobbies?

15:54.054 --> 15:56.756
"Dad, in my free time --
Sorry.

15:56.789 --> 16:01.194
First, I have free time,
something you never had.

16:01.228 --> 16:04.431
And in that time,
I do activities I enjoy

16:04.464 --> 16:07.367
that cost money
but don't bring in any profit

16:07.400 --> 16:09.302
and don't benefit
my family.

16:09.336 --> 16:12.272
No. I just do them
because they feel good,

16:12.305 --> 16:14.041
because
I like the timbre"?

16:14.074 --> 16:16.943
That was a different time,
Jessica.
(sighs)

16:16.976 --> 16:18.278
Our parents were
in survival mode.

16:18.311 --> 16:19.346
We're not.

16:19.379 --> 16:20.880
We've earned the right

16:20.913 --> 16:22.615
to carve out a little space
for our interests.

16:22.649 --> 16:24.717
I don't know.
It just doesn't feel right.

16:24.751 --> 16:25.952
Well, they would
want that for us,

16:25.985 --> 16:27.987
the way we want
a better life for our kids.

16:28.021 --> 16:29.356
It's hard
to find the time.

16:29.389 --> 16:31.724
You spent the last hour
fighting with your sister.

16:31.758 --> 16:33.493
You can find the time.

16:33.526 --> 16:34.594
(sighs)

16:34.627 --> 16:37.330
And it was nice seeing you two
get along for a change.

16:37.364 --> 16:40.800
Look, I know you thought
Connie was trying to be

16:40.833 --> 16:42.035
more like you,
but maybe this time

16:42.069 --> 16:44.171
you could try to be
a little more like Connie.

16:46.173 --> 16:48.341
You went through
a real zebra phase, huh?

16:48.375 --> 16:50.710
(chuckles)

16:50.743 --> 16:52.979
This one is my favorite.

16:53.012 --> 16:54.414
That's a piano.

16:57.117 --> 17:01.088
Well, here we are,
home, sweet home, huh?

17:01.121 --> 17:03.223
Okay.
There you go. Careful.

17:03.256 --> 17:04.191
Take it easy.

17:04.223 --> 17:05.657
Thank you.

17:05.692 --> 17:06.826
(groans)

17:06.858 --> 17:07.727
Here. This will make you
feel better.

17:07.760 --> 17:09.396
It's a grandma package.

17:09.429 --> 17:11.330
I'm 28.

17:11.364 --> 17:12.398
You are.

17:12.432 --> 17:15.034
Here. It's an ice pack
for your hip.

17:15.068 --> 17:16.035
I used it
on my cheeks earlier.

17:16.069 --> 17:17.503
It really works.

17:17.537 --> 17:18.938
And have a Combo.

17:18.971 --> 17:20.240
They're pepperoni-flavored.

17:20.272 --> 17:21.907
(chuckles)

17:21.941 --> 17:24.511
We should go.
I'm all out of small talk.

17:24.544 --> 17:25.712
Thanks for a fun day.

17:25.744 --> 17:27.547
Thanks, boys.
You're good kids.

17:27.579 --> 17:28.415
-Feel better.
-Bye!

17:28.448 --> 17:29.582
Take care!

17:29.616 --> 17:31.518
We are good kids,
aren't we?

17:31.551 --> 17:34.053
We're okay.

17:34.087 --> 17:37.124
I'm sorry you had
such a bad time today.

17:37.157 --> 17:38.091
Oh.

17:38.125 --> 17:39.692
I really thought
you'd like it there.

17:39.726 --> 17:40.760
The place was fine.

17:40.793 --> 17:44.131
It's just -- It's for
the end of people's lives.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.765
And we're just
at the beginning of ours.

17:45.798 --> 17:48.268
Well, I don't know
about the beginning.

17:48.301 --> 17:50.603
Maybe a little more
middle.

17:50.637 --> 17:52.805
Look, I know there's
an age difference between us,

17:52.839 --> 17:55.408
but I just
never think about it.

17:55.442 --> 17:57.744
And being there, that's
all I could think about.

17:57.777 --> 17:59.646
As much as I hate
to think about it,

17:59.679 --> 18:02.081
I want to be sure
that you're taken care of

18:02.115 --> 18:04.050
if something
happens to me.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.452
I don't want
you to be alone.

18:05.485 --> 18:08.488
Marvin, that is so sweet,
but I won't be alone.

18:08.521 --> 18:09.989
I knew it.

18:10.022 --> 18:11.324
Who is he?

18:11.358 --> 18:12.825
Is it Alec Baldwin?

18:12.859 --> 18:15.762
(chuckles)
Yes, Marvin, it's Alec Baldwin.

18:15.795 --> 18:17.464
Alec, he knows!

18:17.497 --> 18:19.999
Come on out
from under the couch!

18:20.032 --> 18:21.768
No. I meant that
I won't be alone here.

18:21.801 --> 18:23.736
Uh-huh.
Look at our community.

18:23.770 --> 18:25.638
Our best friends
live next door.

18:25.672 --> 18:26.673
Yeah.

18:26.706 --> 18:28.107
Yeah.
I'm gonna be okay.

18:28.141 --> 18:29.509
And so are you.

18:29.542 --> 18:31.178
(bag crinkling)

18:31.211 --> 18:32.745
These are good,

18:32.779 --> 18:34.947
but my favorite Combo
is still Honey and Marvin.

18:34.981 --> 18:37.184
Am I the cheese
or the cracker tube?

18:37.217 --> 18:39.686
Why don't you come over here
and find out?

18:40.953 --> 18:44.291
(soft guitar music playing)

18:44.324 --> 18:45.658
(indistinct conversations)

18:48.195 --> 18:52.532
(Jessica humming
 Miss Celie's Blues )

18:59.406 --> 19:01.308
* Sister *

19:01.341 --> 19:04.544
* You've been on my mind *

19:04.577 --> 19:07.547
* Oh, sister *

19:07.580 --> 19:09.115

19:09.148 --> 19:13.453

19:13.486 --> 19:19.559

19:19.592 --> 19:25.232
* I bet you think
 I don't know nothin' *

19:25.265 --> 19:28.468
* But singin' the blues *

19:28.501 --> 19:30.903
* Oh, sister *

19:30.937 --> 19:32.972
* Have I got news for you *

19:33.005 --> 19:34.874
* I'm somethin' *

19:34.907 --> 19:36.843
(voice breaking)
I don't know this song.

19:36.876 --> 19:40.813
* I hope you think that
 you're somethin', too *

19:40.847 --> 19:42.682
(chuckles)

19:45.218 --> 19:47.987
* Oh, scufflin' *

19:48.020 --> 19:50.923
* I been up
 that lonesome road *

19:50.957 --> 19:56.663
* And I seen a lot of suns
 going down *

19:56.696 --> 20:00.032
* Oh, but trust me *

20:00.066 --> 20:05.772
* No lowlife's
 gonna run me around *

20:05.805 --> 20:11.578
* So let me tell you
 somethin', sister *

20:11.611 --> 20:14.347
* Remember your name *

20:14.381 --> 20:16.783
* No twister *

20:16.816 --> 20:19.686
* Gonna steal your stuff away *

20:19.719 --> 20:23.089
* My sister *

20:23.122 --> 20:28.227
* We sure ain't got
 a whole lot of time *

20:29.662 --> 20:33.633
* So, shake your shimmy,
 sister *

20:33.666 --> 20:34.967
(chuckles)

20:38.838 --> 20:40.239
**

20:40.273 --> 20:42.775
Surprise!

20:44.511 --> 20:46.078
Welcome to your new
painting room.

20:46.112 --> 20:47.380
I'm not gonna lie.

20:47.414 --> 20:48.648
I screamed a lot getting rid of
all the spiders.

20:48.681 --> 20:51.751
Oh, Louis, I love it.
Thank you.

20:53.152 --> 20:56.389
Oh, I see you kept
 Untitled Number Three.

20:56.423 --> 20:58.758
It's one of my favorites.

20:58.791 --> 21:01.428
Okay. I'm gonna go pack
the boys' lunches.

21:01.461 --> 21:02.762
No, no, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no, no, no.

21:02.795 --> 21:05.832
I am going to
make the lunches today.

21:05.865 --> 21:07.600
You paint and enjoy.

21:10.703 --> 21:11.971
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

21:12.004 --> 21:13.906
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

21:13.940 --> 21:16.843
I can also water the plants.
You paint.

21:20.980 --> 21:22.482
No, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no,

21:22.515 --> 21:24.584
no, no, no, no,
no, no, no, no.

21:24.617 --> 21:27.153
I'll also yell at Eddie.

21:27.186 --> 21:28.688
And praise Evan.
