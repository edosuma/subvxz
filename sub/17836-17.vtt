So help us stop him.

I think you've realized

11:41.784 --> 11:45.997
that stopping Gerard now,

11:41.784 --> 11:45.997
means killing him.

11:47.790 --> 11:51.628
I'm sorry, Scott,

11:47.790 --> 11:51.628
that chapter

11:47.790 --> 11:51.628
in my life's over.

11:52.920 --> 11:56.049

You're just a pacifist now?

11:56.090 --> 11:59.052
stop me from

I wouldn't help you.

I can offer you guidance.

13:03.116 --> 13:05.326
And my first piece of advice?

13:05.368 --> 13:09.414
You might need to lower

13:05.368 --> 13:09.414
your standards for allies.

I said you forgot

13:21.342 --> 13:23.261
and you were late.

Oh, so I guess this whole

13:23.303 --> 13:26.765

Well, I tracked them to

13:32.019 --> 13:33.854
the Epping Forest,

13:33.896 --> 13:35.607
but these two

13:33.896 --> 13:35.607
found them first.

16:38.080 --> 16:41.000
Your mentor, Gerard,

16:38.080 --> 16:41.000
killed him,

16:41.041 --> 16:43.336
because he believed it would

16:41.041 --> 16:43.336
give him control over

16:43.377 --> 16:45.797
a supernatural creature

16:43.377 --> 16:45.797
called a Kanima.

16:47.214 --> 16:52.345

he held that 16-year-old

under water until

he drowned.

I remember this one

16:59.519 --> 17:01.103
very well.

17:01.145 --> 17:04.357
See how the victims

17:01.145 --> 17:04.357
are outfitted here?

17:01.145 --> 17:04.357
They're hunters.

Gerard's hunters.

17:07.819 --> 17:11.531
He killed them all

17:07.819 --> 17:11.531
to frame a man

17:07.819 --> 17:11.531
named Deucalion.

17:11.572 --> 17:16.619
His hope was it, uh, it would

17:11.572 --> 17:16.619
start a war between

17:11.572 --> 17:16.619
supernaturals and hunters.

17:17.203 --> 17:20.206
This sound familiar? Hmm?

17:20.247 --> 17:22.333
Oh, and by killed...

17:24.251 --> 17:26.086
I mean gassed

17:24.251 --> 17:26.086
into unconsciousness

17:26.128 --> 17:29.883
and then bludgeoned to death

17:26.128 --> 17:29.883
with a club

17:26.128 --> 17:29.883
embedded with claws.

17:40.142 --> 17:41.978
Maybe you'll be

17:40.142 --> 17:41.978
his next victim.

17:47.608 --> 17:51.070
You were attacked

by something called

17:47.608 --> 17:51.070

17:51.111 --> 17:55.241
Gerard withheld vital

17:51.111 --> 17:55.241
information from you

17:51.111 --> 17:55.241
so that he and he alone

17:55.282 --> 17:57.410
would be the one

17:55.282 --> 17:57.410
to kill this creature.

the weapon needed

18:00.204 --> 18:04.083
to kill this thing,

18:04.124 --> 18:06.794
then maybe he could have

18:04.124 --> 18:06.794
prevented all this bloodshed.

18:06.836 --> 18:10.548
All this, this pain,

18:06.836 --> 18:10.548
could have been avoided.

18:23.185 --> 18:27.648
understanding each other.

It is all avoidable.

Do you wanna know

18:42.204 --> 18:48.377
what I see in

18:42.204 --> 18:48.377
your little show and tell?

18:48.419 --> 18:52.799
I see a sheriff unable

18:48.419 --> 18:52.799
to control the violence

18:48.419 --> 18:52.799
in his own county.

18:53.841 --> 18:55.927
A county he's sworn

18:53.841 --> 18:55.927
to protect.

18:58.554 --> 19:02.683
I see the same sheriff

18:58.554 --> 19:02.683
in way over his head.

19:02.725 --> 19:04.894
And not ready

19:02.725 --> 19:04.894
to believe the truth

19:04.936 --> 19:08.064
that's been staring him

19:04.936 --> 19:08.064
in the face for years.

19:14.737 --> 19:17.531
I was told I was the victim

19:14.737 --> 19:17.531
of a wild animal attack.

A bear.

I was lied to.

You lied to protect them

You're an ineffective sheriff

19:30.210 --> 19:33.422

So don't try and tell me

19:33.464 --> 19:36.717
that Gerard puts

19:33.464 --> 19:36.717
his own interests first

19:36.759 --> 19:39.178
when you only choose

19:36.759 --> 19:39.178
them over us.

30:04.386 --> 30:06.138
Does it matter if they

30:04.386 --> 30:06.138
can help us beat Gerard?

30:06.179 --> 30:07.723
It matters if

30:06.179 --> 30:07.723
they're murderers.

30:08.515 --> 30:09.808
So we should

30:08.515 --> 30:09.808
forget about it.

30:10.892 --> 30:12.852
Probably.

30:12.894 --> 30:14.813
There's got to be

30:12.894 --> 30:14.813
someone else

30:12.894 --> 30:14.813
who can help us.

30:16.273 --> 30:17.733
We're not that desperate.

30:17.775 --> 30:19.735
And going to them would

30:17.775 --> 30:19.735
be really desperate, right?

30:29.495 --> 30:31.330
THEO: Does the teacher

30:29.495 --> 30:31.330
know about this?

30:31.371 --> 30:33.206
That's the teacher.

30:33.248 --> 30:36.251
Unless there's a gun in

30:33.248 --> 30:36.251
there, too, this isn't helping

30:33.248 --> 30:36.251
us find the shooter.

30:37.002 --> 30:38.378
Why'd you hide these bodies?

30:38.420 --> 30:39.921
We didn't wanna get caught.

30:39.963 --> 30:41.256
Caught doing what?

30:41.298 --> 30:44.510
Testing them. To see

30:41.298 --> 30:44.510
if they were werewolves.

30:44.551 --> 30:45.885
And they were.

30:45.927 --> 30:47.763
Just like you tested Corey?

30:47.805 --> 30:51.183
But we didn't kill them.

30:47.805 --> 30:51.183
Look at their faces.

30:47.805 --> 30:51.183
Something else did that.

30:51.224 --> 30:52.601
The Anuk-ite.

30:52.643 --> 30:53.893
The what?

30:53.935 --> 30:56.855
Why would it want to kill

30:53.935 --> 30:56.855
anyone? It feeds off fear.

30:56.896 --> 30:58.190
Dead people aren't afraid.

30:58.231 --> 30:59.692
Maybe the killing

30:58.231 --> 30:59.692
is just a by-product.

30:59.941 --> 31:01.026
Of what?

31:01.067 --> 31:02.902
Of it looking

31:01.067 --> 31:02.902
for its other half.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.364
Which means it's looking for

31:02.944 --> 31:05.364
a supernatural creature.

31:02.944 --> 31:05.364
Someone like us.

31:05.405 --> 31:07.366
So these three

31:05.405 --> 31:07.366
could have been werewolves,

31:07.407 --> 31:09.451
just not the ones

31:07.407 --> 31:09.451
that the Anuk-ite's

31:07.407 --> 31:09.451
were looking for.

31:10.661 --> 31:11.870
Which means you've

31:10.661 --> 31:11.870
been helping it.

31:12.954 --> 31:14.373
Idiot.

31:14.414 --> 31:15.957
I don't even know what

31:14.414 --> 31:15.957
you guys are talking about.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.918
I was just helping Aaron.

31:15.999 --> 31:18.918
It was his idea

31:15.999 --> 31:18.918
to test everyone.

31:18.960 --> 31:20.128
Who's Aaron?

31:20.170 --> 31:23.465
He's on the lacrosse team.

31:20.170 --> 31:23.465
He's just a freshman.

31:25.217 --> 31:27.427

31:25.217 --> 31:27.427

31:27.469 --> 31:28.721
He wanted

31:27.469 --> 31:28.721

31:29.388 --> 31:31.431
He's the Anuk-ite.

32:09.887 --> 32:10.929
We came for the pack.

32:14.892 --> 32:17.269
It'll be okay. Come on.

32:17.686 --> 32:18.771

33:12.866 --> 33:16.286
He led me.

33:12.866 --> 33:16.286
(QUIVERS) He wanted me

33:12.866 --> 33:16.286
to find it.

33:17.203 --> 33:18.538

33:19.080 --> 33:20.290
Halwyn.

(LEAVES RUSTLING)

33:26.546 --> 33:28.966
Why would a dead

33:26.546 --> 33:28.966
Hellhound bring you here?

33:30.133 --> 33:32.719
Also, isn't he dead?

33:32.761 --> 33:35.054
I guess the connection between

33:32.761 --> 33:35.054
a Banshee and a Hellhound...

33:35.096 --> 33:36.055
Dead Hellhound?

33:36.097 --> 33:38.684
Is stronger than I thought.

33:38.725 --> 33:40.853
As for the why,

33:38.725 --> 33:40.853
I'm hoping

33:40.894 --> 33:42.896
if I find the body,

33:40.894 --> 33:42.896
I'll figure that part out.

33:42.938 --> 33:45.064
You know, there's a pile

33:42.938 --> 33:45.064
of dead bodies back there.

33:46.107 --> 33:47.442
It's a different body.

33:47.484 --> 33:49.653
There's not another body

33:47.484 --> 33:49.653
out here. I'd smell it.

33:50.946 --> 33:55.033
I'm a harbinger

33:50.946 --> 33:55.033
of death. Trust me.

33:56.576 --> 33:58.203
They wanted to know who

33:56.576 --> 33:58.203
shot up Scott's house.

33:58.244 --> 33:59.746
Yeah, but I didn't

33:58.244 --> 33:59.746
tell them.

33:59.788 --> 34:01.039
Well, how do you

33:59.788 --> 34:01.039
know who did it?

34:07.128 --> 34:10.215
Gabe? What did you do?

34:10.256 --> 34:11.842
I did it for you.

34:15.178 --> 34:17.055
You shot up

34:15.178 --> 34:17.055
a house for me?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.225
What are you trying to do?

34:18.264 --> 34:20.225
Get me killed?

34:20.266 --> 34:21.601
I'm trying to

34:20.266 --> 34:21.601
keep you alive.

34:22.602 --> 34:23.770
I told Monroe it was you.

34:23.812 --> 34:25.355
So try being

34:23.812 --> 34:25.355
a little grateful.

34:26.606 --> 34:28.567
You told her

34:26.606 --> 34:28.567
it was me?

34:28.608 --> 34:29.902
Why do you think

34:28.608 --> 34:29.902
you're still alive?

34:43.916 --> 34:45.834
(BREATHING HEAVILY)

34:48.670 --> 34:52.049
How is this possible?

34:48.670 --> 34:52.049
We saw Parrish kill it.

34:52.090 --> 34:53.675
This one's different.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.969
Yeah. I think Lydia's right.

34:53.717 --> 34:55.969
I think this is

34:53.717 --> 34:55.969
part of the pack.

34:56.011 --> 34:57.345

35:00.265 --> 35:01.767
Its skin is gone.

35:01.808 --> 35:03.518
Wolves have to burn

35:01.808 --> 35:03.518
tattoos into their skin.

35:03.560 --> 35:06.104
My tattoo is probably scarred

35:03.560 --> 35:06.104
into my muscles, too.

35:07.146 --> 35:08.774
Okay, but why are

35:07.146 --> 35:08.774
there two of these bodies?

35:10.483 --> 35:12.736
Because the Anuk-ite

35:10.483 --> 35:12.736
has two faces.

35:14.446 --> 35:15.822
That's why Halwyn

35:14.446 --> 35:15.822
sent you here, Lydia.

35:17.365 --> 35:19.868
He wanted me to find

35:17.365 --> 35:19.868
the Anuk-ite's other face.

35:29.294 --> 35:31.004
It's a bad day

35:29.294 --> 35:31.004
for finding bodies.

35:31.046 --> 35:33.381
There's gonna be a lot more

35:31.046 --> 35:33.381
if we don't find

35:31.046 --> 35:33.381
Aaron's other half.

35:34.215 --> 35:35.508
Which we know

35:34.215 --> 35:35.508
nothing about.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.844
We do know one thing.

35:35.550 --> 35:37.844
We know it's a werewolf.

35:37.886 --> 35:40.764
We need to find this

35:37.886 --> 35:40.764
other werewolf right now.

35:40.806 --> 35:43.182
Preferably before

35:40.806 --> 35:43.182
they merge.

35:43.224 --> 35:44.142
What happens if they merge?

35:46.019 --> 35:49.188
I don't know, but

35:46.019 --> 35:49.188
I got a feeling that it's not

35:46.019 --> 35:49.188
going to be good.

35:49.230 --> 35:51.483
Any chance you got to put

35:49.230 --> 35:51.483
together that army, Scott?

35:51.524 --> 35:52.985
You're looking at it.

35:53.026 --> 35:56.529
Let's hope this thing

35:53.026 --> 35:56.529
doesn't feed off desperation,

35:56.571 --> 35:59.365
because this room

35:56.571 --> 35:59.365
reeks of it.

35:59.407 --> 36:01.618
What happened?

36:01.660 --> 36:05.497
The hunters destroyed

36:01.660 --> 36:05.497
my perfect automobile.

36:05.538 --> 36:06.999
So, if this thing had

36:05.538 --> 36:06.999
anything to do with it,

36:07.040 --> 36:11.544
I'd like to see its demise

36:07.040 --> 36:11.544
is appropriately painful.

36:13.254 --> 36:14.422
I thought you

36:13.254 --> 36:14.422
had two cars?

36:18.551 --> 36:20.971
There's going to

36:18.551 --> 36:20.971
be hell to pay.

36:28.979 --> 36:31.189
a lot of revenge to plan.

36:31.230 --> 36:34.026
No revenge until you

36:31.230 --> 36:34.026
tell me why you came back.

36:34.067 --> 36:36.695
Gerard and his hunters

36:34.067 --> 36:36.695
blew up my cars,

36:36.736 --> 36:38.488
I would be inside
