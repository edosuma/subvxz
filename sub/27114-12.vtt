end up quitting
college because...
No, no, no, no, no.

00:11.145 --> 00:12.444
We'll never--
we're not doing that.

You-- that's how you feel!

I mean, I'm gonna do the test

Oh!
Oh, my God!

00:30.264 --> 00:33.732
Maybe you can come with?
And let's have sex.

00:33.801 --> 00:35.601
I definitely wanna have sex.

00:35.669 --> 00:37.236

Yes.

Kim and Mariahlynn cliqued up

01:02.696 --> 01:04.229
To talk about me?
You do everything

01:04.298 --> 01:05.831
for, like, clout.

01:05.900 --> 01:09.201
Even down to little Infinity.

I don't wanna talk about her.

You weren't invited, but--

Everyone, seriously.
You guys are even invited

No, I have to
invite you personally. Yeah.
Oh yeah?

03:11.025 --> 03:12.591
Maggie, did you leave him
on the couch

03:12.660 --> 03:13.592
or did you bring him in?

03:13.661 --> 03:14.993
Nah, he slept
in the bed.

03:15.062 --> 03:16.295
Course I did.

03:16.363 --> 03:20.399
I'm still mad at Maino
not supporting my music career.

03:20.467 --> 03:23.969
But we're in Costa Rica,
and we're stuck with each other.

03:24.038 --> 03:26.338
So I'm gonna make
the best of this trip,

and I'm not gonna ruin it
for anyone else

with Yandy the other night.

Safaree, is your room
near Juju's room?

03:35.849 --> 03:38.650
No, it's not.
I made sure it was far away.

03:38.719 --> 03:40.752
This guy and I are not
friends right now.

03:40.821 --> 03:43.488
Whoa, yo, you heard Juju?

03:52.166 --> 03:54.933
Safaree-- come on, Safaree.

03:55.002 --> 03:56.635
That was mad rude.

03:56.704 --> 03:58.036
That was, partner.
(Juju)
And it's-- it's my point

03:58.105 --> 03:59.605
of that
you're a jerk of a friend.

03:59.673 --> 04:01.340
(Joe sighing)

04:01.408 --> 04:03.942
Safaree and I have always
been good friends,

04:04.011 --> 04:05.911
and he's someone
I've been there for

04:05.980 --> 04:07.779
in some of his worst times.

04:07.848 --> 04:10.315
If I see anything crazy
going on with him online,

04:10.384 --> 04:11.783
I hit him up
and make sure he's good.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.051
But he doesn't
do the same for me.

04:13.120 --> 04:15.153
It just doesn't feel like
a two-way street

04:15.222 --> 04:16.521
when it comes
to this friendship.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.056
But it is what it is.

04:18.125 --> 04:19.691
It's hurtful when friends
aren't good to you.

04:19.760 --> 04:21.026
When you tryin' to level up

04:21.095 --> 04:23.228
and another (bleep)
just immature and childish.

04:23.297 --> 04:25.597
A'ight, look, I'm sorry
if that came off rude

04:25.666 --> 04:28.700
but I-I...
I didn't mean for it--

04:28.769 --> 04:30.335
It didn't come off rude,
it was just rude.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.638
(Maino)
It was rude, dawg.
All right, I'm sorry
for being rude.

04:32.706 --> 04:34.673
You done messed up
the vibe of the table, bro.

04:34.742 --> 04:35.941
I gotta be honest.
No, I didn't.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.276
I don't think he's invited
to the excursion later.

04:37.344 --> 04:39.011
What excursion?
Let's leave him behind--

04:39.079 --> 04:40.812
What excursion?

04:40.881 --> 04:42.247
We're gonna do a few things.
We're shoppi--

04:42.316 --> 04:43.815
Just as long as we ain't got
no place that look like Dyckman

04:43.884 --> 04:46.084
'cause, you know,
my man can't go.

04:46.153 --> 04:47.119
(all laughing)

04:47.187 --> 04:48.253
You told on
them (bleep), man?

04:48.322 --> 04:51.290
Who?
The (bleep)
when you got robbed.

04:51.358 --> 04:53.558
They go-- listen,
I ain't tell on nobody.

04:53.627 --> 04:55.360
Let me tell you.
If you a black truck

04:55.429 --> 04:56.862
speeding through a toll
with no lights on

04:56.930 --> 04:58.563
and no license plate,
you think police

04:58.632 --> 05:00.065
is just gonna say,
hey, have a great--

05:00.134 --> 05:02.267
Indeed.
They crashed,
they got chased.

05:02.336 --> 05:03.468
I ain't have to say
or do nothing.

05:03.537 --> 05:05.137
I just wanted some
clarification on that.

05:05.205 --> 05:06.438
Yeah, I can vouch for him
'cause he didn't--

05:06.507 --> 05:08.540
and they were-- they were
just giving the reports

05:08.609 --> 05:10.108
as we were there like,
"Oh, we, you know,

05:10.177 --> 05:11.343
they just caught him on
the George Washington Bridge"

05:11.412 --> 05:12.444
and all that kinda stuff.

05:12.513 --> 05:14.179
That was something
I always wanted to know.

05:14.248 --> 05:17.749
Look, I'm not a snitch.
I ain't have to snitch.

05:17.818 --> 05:20.385
These thieves were so dumb,
they got caught on their own.

05:20.454 --> 05:22.254
When you get
into a high-speed chase

05:22.323 --> 05:25.791
from the scene of the crime
and get caught,

05:25.859 --> 05:28.427
nobody needs to give
anymore information.

05:28.495 --> 05:29.961
I thought we were gonna
eat as a family.

05:30.030 --> 05:31.363
Where's Yandy?
Where's Kimbella?

05:31.432 --> 05:33.598
I invited everyone.
I guess they're still sleeping.

05:33.667 --> 05:35.300
Hopefully they're
somewhere talking.

05:35.369 --> 05:36.635
That's what I hope.

05:36.704 --> 05:39.237
That they're
somewhere talking?
Yes.

05:39.306 --> 05:40.706
They have a few things
to work out.

05:40.774 --> 05:41.973
Is the problem
about money?

05:42.042 --> 05:43.442
Is the problem abo--
(Maggie)
It don't matter.

05:43.510 --> 05:45.944
Is the problem...
Does anybody even know
what it's about?

05:46.013 --> 05:48.480
Somebody in danger?
Does anybody know?

05:48.549 --> 05:50.816
They're both hurt,
and they just need
to get it out.

05:50.884 --> 05:53.318
As far as this whole
Kimbella and Yandy issue,

05:53.387 --> 05:55.020
I hope that they can
get together

05:55.089 --> 05:57.422
and resolve this
issue privately.

05:57.491 --> 05:59.524
Even if they're not
friends, kumbaya,

05:59.593 --> 06:02.127
I want them to at least be
cordial on this trip.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.129
Today we're gonna go
into the city,

06:04.198 --> 06:05.263
we're gonna get
to know Tamarindo.

06:05.332 --> 06:07.299
We're gonna go shopping,

06:07.368 --> 06:08.734
and we're gonna do
a few more things.

06:08.802 --> 06:11.036
So is everybody down?
I'm down.

06:11.105 --> 06:13.805
Okay, guys, I'm gonna take care
of this and I'll meet you guys--
Trust me, we know that.

Hey!

06:33.427 --> 06:35.227
Oh, you paying?
Oh, I'm late late.

06:35.295 --> 06:36.962
Actually, I'm--
I'm leavin', let's go.

06:37.030 --> 06:39.064
Girl, I'm about
to grab me something.

06:39.133 --> 06:40.365
Everybody else
is at the lobby waiting

06:40.434 --> 06:41.700
'cause we're gonna go
into the city,

06:41.769 --> 06:42.901
we're gonna go
shopping and stuff,

06:42.970 --> 06:44.102
and do a few excursions.

06:44.171 --> 06:46.338
Oh, nice.
Feel free to join us.

06:46.407 --> 06:47.672
Aww, thank you.

06:47.741 --> 06:50.742
I'm not gonna force Kimbella
nor Yandy to speak,

06:50.811 --> 06:52.411
but Kimbella did promise me

06:52.479 --> 06:54.212
that there would be no drama
on this trip,

06:54.281 --> 06:56.882
and I just wanna make sure
that's still the case.

06:56.950 --> 06:59.584
So, okay.
What's up?

06:59.653 --> 07:01.686
I really invited everyone here
to have a good time.

07:01.755 --> 07:03.855
Yes, you told me.
Remember I told you,

07:03.924 --> 07:06.691
um, I was gonna invite Yandy
and I said no drama.

07:06.760 --> 07:08.226
You was like,
"Oh, it's cool".

07:08.295 --> 07:10.228
And I didn't get
the opportunity

07:10.297 --> 07:12.898
to tell Yandy that
you were coming.
Okay.

07:12.966 --> 07:14.833
And yesterday,
we had a conversation

07:14.902 --> 07:16.668
and she's all upset,
like, really worked up.

07:16.737 --> 07:17.836
And I'm like,
Yandy, what's going on?

07:17.905 --> 07:19.771
She said, "Oh, you didn't
tell me you invited Kim,

07:19.840 --> 07:20.772
you should've gave me
the heads-up."

07:20.841 --> 07:22.407
I'm like, well,
I already talked to Kim

07:22.476 --> 07:23.909
and Kim told me there wasn't
gonna be any drama.

07:23.977 --> 07:25.944
She's like, "Oh, but Juju,

07:26.013 --> 07:27.112
"she's been talking
about my kids

07:27.181 --> 07:28.513
"and she's been
talking about me

07:28.582 --> 07:30.982
"to Mariahlynn
and to Nya Lee.

07:31.051 --> 07:33.518
"And she said that I--
that I, um,

07:33.587 --> 07:34.719
that I have
Infinity for clout."

07:34.788 --> 07:36.521
And she's like,
"I wanna go home,
I'm leavin'."

07:36.590 --> 07:38.123
I'm like, what's going on?

07:38.192 --> 07:40.225
Yandy does not need
to be so dramatic

07:40.294 --> 07:41.693
about her going home.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.261
It's not even that serious.

07:43.330 --> 07:46.364
And if she thinks that
I was talking about
her children,

07:46.433 --> 07:49.000
she needs to come and talk to me
like a grown woman.

07:49.069 --> 07:50.969
I didn't talk about
the "kids" with an S.

07:51.038 --> 07:53.171
I've only spoken abou--
What did you say exactly?

07:53.240 --> 07:56.074
That she was probably
just doing it for
herself to look good.

07:56.143 --> 07:57.809
You said "probably just
doing it to make her look good"?

07:57.878 --> 07:58.944
Yeah, to make herself
look good.

07:59.012 --> 08:00.846
And I said I hope
that's not the reason.

08:00.914 --> 08:02.614
Okay, okay.
That's exactly
what I said.

08:02.683 --> 08:03.815
That's my truth.
So that's different
from sayi--

08:03.884 --> 08:05.717
Yeah, and that's how

you really wanted to pursue.

16:35.962 --> 16:37.562
You just came up out
of the clear blue

16:37.630 --> 16:39.130
and said, "I wanna
get on that song."

16:39.199 --> 16:40.732
You don't even rap.

16:40.800 --> 16:43.301
If this is your passion
and your dream,

16:43.370 --> 16:45.269
I would be
the first person to know.
It's true.

16:45.338 --> 16:48.072
So prior to this,
she never, ever gave you

16:48.141 --> 16:50.475
an inkling of a feeling that
she wanted to do music?

16:50.543 --> 16:52.243
Well, she did music before,
prior to me.

16:52.312 --> 16:54.879
Before she met me,
she had a million
views on YouTube.

16:54.948 --> 16:56.647
But music a lifestyle,

16:56.716 --> 16:58.082
it's not something that
you turn on and off.

16:58.151 --> 17:00.818
So are you willing
to commit the time

17:00.887 --> 17:01.986
and the energy
and the sacrifice

17:02.055 --> 17:03.254
that it takes
to be in this?

17:03.323 --> 17:04.889
So let me ask you this,

17:04.958 --> 17:06.858
because I be having
that same point to Cyn.

17:06.926 --> 17:08.326
But when I'm trying to say it,

17:08.395 --> 17:09.794
it's like she don't
really understand

17:09.863 --> 17:11.095
because she hadn't
experienced it.

17:11.164 --> 17:12.230
When you saying this
to Maggie...

17:12.298 --> 17:13.664
Right.
...she get what
you're saying?

17:13.733 --> 17:15.933
No. It's like...

17:16.002 --> 17:18.536
They look at it
like, you my guy,

17:18.605 --> 17:20.605
you make your living
off music,

17:20.673 --> 17:22.673
you should be supporting me.
Period.

17:22.742 --> 17:23.975
And I'm like,
I do support you.

17:24.044 --> 17:26.110
I know Maggie feels like
me not putting her on my song

17:26.179 --> 17:28.880
is not supporting her,
but that's not the case.

17:28.948 --> 17:32.216
I just wanted to know that she's
absolutely serious about it.

17:32.285 --> 17:34.352
But I'm here on
the island with my girl,

17:34.421 --> 17:36.220
and I ain't really worried
about the small (bleep).

17:36.289 --> 17:37.855
I got a little something
up my sleeve

17:37.924 --> 17:40.224
to kinda smooth it out,
to make it right, you know?

17:40.293 --> 17:41.692
Well, whatever going on,

17:41.761 --> 17:44.095
y'all look--
y'all look better.
We go-- we gonna be good.

17:44.164 --> 17:45.363
I'ma fix it up.
I'ma do something.
I'ma do something.

17:45.432 --> 17:47.465
She looking better.
I'ma fix her up.

17:47.534 --> 17:49.133
And you know what?
I'ma do something nice
out here.

17:49.202 --> 17:50.568
I'ma figure it out.

17:50.637 --> 17:51.803
(bleep), this is
the best place to do it.

17:51.871 --> 17:52.904
Exactly.

17:52.972 --> 17:53.938
I don't know if that's
'cause we out here

17:54.007 --> 17:55.440
and it's beautiful
and (bleep) out here.

17:55.508 --> 17:56.774

out here too.

17:56.843 --> 17:59.510

It's back on
and (bleep) be like...

17:59.579 --> 18:00.912
On-- on the little walkthrough,

18:00.980 --> 18:02.914
Cyn was pointing out rings
through the little window...

18:02.982 --> 18:03.915
She's been saying
the word "ring"

18:03.983 --> 18:05.917
for the last 11 months.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.752
Like, she say it
to Kimbella.

18:07.821 --> 18:08.753
And I just laugh in my head

18:08.822 --> 18:10.822
'cause, like,
Kimbella did a bid.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.324
Like, Kimbella did ten years
and got a ring.

18:13.393 --> 18:16.094
I'm super happy, applause.

18:16.162 --> 18:18.396
But we at three years.

18:18.465 --> 18:20.131
Like, why you-- you don't
have to drop your hints.

18:20.200 --> 18:21.632
Like, love will do it.

18:21.701 --> 18:23.234
Love will just
take care of that.

18:23.303 --> 18:25.603
Mm-hmm, that's right.
So what's up?

18:25.672 --> 18:29.507
What's meant to be will be,
and it's gonna feel natural.
You ain't gotta force it.

Me personally,
when it comes to putting

18:31.678 --> 18:32.844
a ring on somebody's finger,

18:32.912 --> 18:35.012

to hate each other.

I never hated you.
That's not my intentions.

26:17.643 --> 26:19.677
I told you this,
we could be cool.

26:19.745 --> 26:22.112
What I won't accept, though,
is the disrespect.

34:11.517 --> 34:14.217
You had a conversation
about my kids.

34:14.286 --> 34:15.652
Let's clarify something.

34:15.721 --> 34:17.120
I've never had a conversation
about your kids.

34:17.189 --> 34:18.622
About Infinity?

34:18.690 --> 34:20.924
You didn't tell
Mariahlynn

34:20.993 --> 34:22.426
that this whole thing

34:22.494 --> 34:24.461
was a paparazzi stunt?
No.

34:24.530 --> 34:28.365
What I did say was I hope
that you did

34:28.434 --> 34:31.168
foster her for
the right reasons.
That's all I said.

34:31.236 --> 34:32.369
What the (bleep)
does that mean?

34:32.438 --> 34:33.603
What it-- What I mean.

34:33.672 --> 34:36.106
Don't reference none
of my children.

34:36.175 --> 34:38.508
In talki--
Nobody referenced
any of your children.

34:38.577 --> 34:41.678
And then furthermore,
I feel like now
you're using this

34:41.747 --> 34:44.714
to play the (bleep) victim,
'cause we haven't even resolved

34:44.783 --> 34:47.217
the other (bleep)
that I've been talking about.

34:47.286 --> 34:48.852
What the (bleep) is the issue?
Talk about it.

34:48.921 --> 34:50.320
What's the issue?
The issue is that

34:50.389 --> 34:51.988
you still lying
about the fact...
Lying about what?

34:52.057 --> 34:54.624
The fact that,
at the end of the day,

34:54.693 --> 34:57.561
I pulled up,
and you know I pulled up

34:57.629 --> 34:59.463
because you asked me
to be there.

34:59.531 --> 35:02.132
Oh, my God!
You're talking about this party

35:02.201 --> 35:03.633
with the baby mamas again!

35:03.702 --> 35:04.968
(woman)
Why is she here?

35:05.037 --> 35:08.472
I can't come here now without
bitches gettin' crazy?

35:08.540 --> 35:10.540
The truth of the
matter is you pulled up

35:10.609 --> 35:13.743
because we were devising
a plan to get you a check.

35:16.181 --> 35:17.647
We made a pact.

35:17.716 --> 35:21.151
This pact had nothing to do
with her ever going upstairs.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.087
She was gonna get a great look
by looking like
she was my friend

35:24.156 --> 35:27.057
coming to save the day
or coming to have my back

35:27.126 --> 35:29.993
and get a check.
That's the truth.

35:30.062 --> 35:31.094
I don't give a (bleep)
what you got to say.

35:31.163 --> 35:32.729
You think I have
to lie for a check?

35:32.798 --> 35:33.930
You a liar!

35:33.999 --> 35:36.433
I'm not agreeing to her
getting me no (bleep) check.

35:36.502 --> 35:37.868
She didn't
give me nothing.
Then this is over.

35:37.936 --> 35:40.370
Bitch, yo,
this has been a (bleep)...
Watch your mouth.

35:40.439 --> 35:42.372
Watch your mouth.
Watch my mouth for what?

35:42.441 --> 35:43.473
For what? For what?
Watch your mouth.

35:43.542 --> 35:44.574
What are you gonna do?

35:47.946 --> 35:49.813
Let's just tell the truth.
Yo, this has been a (bleep)...

35:49.882 --> 35:51.481
Watch your mouth.
Watch your mouth.

35:51.550 --> 35:53.250
Watch my mouth for what?
For what? For what?
Watch your mouth.

35:53.318 --> 35:54.484
I'm tired of the show.

35:54.553 --> 35:56.419
Come on,
it's fake (bleep).

35:56.488 --> 35:59.422
Yes, me and Yandy came up
with a plan

35:59.491 --> 36:01.558
for me to show up at little
Mendeecees birthday party

36:01.627 --> 36:03.093
with the baby mothers there.

36:03.162 --> 36:06.563
But, no the (bleep) it was not
for no checks.

36:06.632 --> 36:10.033
I solely went there because
my friend asked me to be there

36:10.102 --> 36:12.102
and that
is my loyalty to her.

36:12.171 --> 36:14.538
It was about
this drama I had

36:14.606 --> 36:16.540
with Mendeecees'
children's mother.

36:16.608 --> 36:19.009
I never wanted you there
with them face to face

36:19.077 --> 36:20.477
'cause I never wanted
you to fight.

36:20.546 --> 36:22.279
If I had to fight,
I would have.

36:22.347 --> 36:23.980
Been there, done that.

36:24.049 --> 36:28.218
When those reunion
tapes played and I sat there
like, "Nope, I didn't know,"

36:28.287 --> 36:30.153
it had me looking crazy.

36:30.222 --> 36:34.491
(Nina Parker)
It sounds like you knew
that she was in front before...

36:34.560 --> 36:37.360
Yeah, she called me
right when she was...

36:37.429 --> 36:39.296
already there.

36:39.364 --> 36:42.165
In that very moment,
I coulda cleared the air.

36:42.234 --> 36:44.634
And we wouldn't
have been here today...
I'm not gonna
throw you under the bus

36:44.703 --> 36:47.037
without your permission.
We just built this one.

36:48.540 --> 36:50.340
We made a pact to you.

36:50.409 --> 36:53.310
Simply because you
were my friend,

36:53.378 --> 36:55.912
and I'm loyal
to the pact that we made.

36:55.981 --> 37:00.884
Nobody knows unless we both
say somebody knows. Period.

37:00.953 --> 37:04.354
You want to act like you're this
Miss Goody Two-Shoes.

37:04.423 --> 37:06.289
Like you never
do anything wrong.

37:06.358 --> 37:09.159
How?
Everybody else around you
is the problem.

37:09.228 --> 37:12.028
How? Have I ever told you,
you a problem?
And that's an issue for me.

37:12.097 --> 37:15.298
Have I ever publically
said anything about you,
against you? Ever?

37:15.367 --> 37:16.333
Yes.
What?

37:16.401 --> 37:18.235
You've told me
that I'm the reason

37:18.303 --> 37:20.870
that you and Juelz
are not working together.

37:20.939 --> 37:23.273
You need to understand
that if I feel like

37:23.342 --> 37:25.342
I'm in the middle
of this relationship,

37:25.410 --> 37:27.043
and it's compromising
my business,

37:27.112 --> 37:29.346
and it's compromising
my relationship with him,

37:29.414 --> 37:32.916
I'm done with him
and I'm done with you.

37:32.985 --> 37:34.851
That was the reason
I stepped away.

37:34.920 --> 37:37.687
You could have came to me
at any point, without cameras,

37:37.756 --> 37:39.756
and you never did that.

37:39.825 --> 37:42.225
Everything you do
is for yourself...

37:42.294 --> 37:43.426
Okay.
...and nobody else.

37:43.495 --> 37:45.428
All right, darlin'.
And it's unfortunate.

37:45.497 --> 37:48.365
Hopefully, one day
really learn and own up

37:48.433 --> 37:49.966
to who the (bleep)
you really are.

37:50.035 --> 37:53.970
She can never say I'm sorry.
She can never say, "I apologize

37:54.039 --> 37:57.607
for hurting your feelings,"
or "Sorry, for not
having your back."

37:57.676 --> 37:59.876
Just be real for once.

37:59.945 --> 38:01.911
I knocked on your door because,
at the end of the day,

38:01.980 --> 38:05.215
we're in Costa Rica.
We should be able to co-exist,

38:05.284 --> 38:08.184
and not do this (bleep)
in front of these girls.

38:08.253 --> 38:11.054
We too grown.
We here to have a good time.

38:11.123 --> 38:14.124
I'm not having no
good time, smile
at nobody's face.

38:14.192 --> 38:15.458
Well, then what you--
All right.

38:15.527 --> 38:18.194
We should be able
to co-exist.

38:18.263 --> 38:20.096
We don't have
to be friends.
There's no co-exist

38:20.165 --> 38:22.766
when somebody's talking
about you constantly.
All right.
All right. All right.

38:22.834 --> 38:24.768
That's it.
I have nothing else
to say to you.

38:24.836 --> 38:26.736
Like, this is
beyond disgusting.

38:26.805 --> 38:29.806
I didn't have to leave
my kids for this.

38:29.875 --> 38:31.207
Maybe you need
to go home with your kids,

38:31.276 --> 38:33.443
and that's it.
Goodnight.

38:40.285 --> 38:42.585
(man) (Kimbella)
Next timeOh, look.
"Love and Hip-The zip line.

38:42.654 --> 38:44.054
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.

38:44.122 --> 38:45.355
I'm afraid of heights.
I'ma take pictures for y'all.

38:45.424 --> 38:46.823
I don't got time for this.

38:46.892 --> 38:49.392
(women screaming)

38:49.461 --> 38:51.027
(Maino)
Let's get it, Joe!

38:51.096 --> 38:52.529
How we doin' over here?

38:52.597 --> 38:54.597
Are y'all good?

38:54.666 --> 38:55.799
Did everything for Cyn?

38:55.867 --> 38:57.534
No, I got something set up.

38:57.602 --> 38:59.769
Oh, my God.
(Joe grunts)

39:01.006 --> 39:02.439
Wait a minute.

39:02.507 --> 39:05.008
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
Oh, my God.

39:05.077 --> 39:06.242
I'm not (bleep)
with Joe right now.

39:06.311 --> 39:07.644
His delivery last night

39:07.713 --> 39:12.382
was completely
unacceptable.

39:12.451 --> 39:14.818
I do not tolerate disrespect.

39:14.886 --> 39:18.555
Every time I try to get this
proposal thing moving.

39:18.623 --> 39:20.090
Mm-hm.
Something happens.

39:20.158 --> 39:23.727
I want to apologize to you
for making you feel that

39:23.795 --> 39:25.362
I don't support you.

39:25.430 --> 39:27.630
Music is a passion of mine.

39:27.699 --> 39:29.666
And I don't know if
you want to be there
for me

39:29.735 --> 39:31.935
to help me to be a artist.

39:33.805 --> 39:36.039
He's acting out.

39:37.376 --> 39:38.608
I walked up to you at
the end of the game.

39:38.677 --> 39:40.377
You said, "Yeah, man
I'm trying to have a baby."

39:40.445 --> 39:42.779
(women)
Whoa!

39:42.848 --> 39:45.582
Safari, you don't feel like you
owe me and my lady an apology?

39:45.650 --> 39:46.683
No.

39:46.752 --> 39:49.452
I'm not asking you something.
I'm telling you.

39:49.521 --> 39:51.721
You gonna respect my (bleep)
word, my (bleep).

39:51.790 --> 39:53.156
What we talking
about though?

39:53.225 --> 39:55.325
(bleep) everybody.
What was said?

39:55.394 --> 39:56.860
Oh.
