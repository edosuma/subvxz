00:01.583 --> 00:05.166
When was the last time
you spoke with Cassian Andor?

00:08.625 --> 00:11.500
<i>Ferrix has been
hiding long enough.</i>

00:11.500 --> 00:13.458
<i>So now
you're taking on the Empire?</i>

00:13.458 --> 00:15.291
What's left to keep you here?

00:15.291 --> 00:16.375
The Rebellion.

00:16.375 --> 00:19.166
Did he tell you?
He's writin' a manifesto.

00:19.166 --> 00:20.875
You're my ideal reader.

00:26.166 --> 00:27.875
He said to give this to you.

00:27.875 --> 00:32.375
So, searching for a more
fluid banking situation, are we?

00:32.375 --> 00:33.708
What will it cost?

00:33.708 --> 00:36.375
I have a 14-year-old son.
I'd like to bring him with me.

00:36.375 --> 00:39.541
- I'm not asking for betrothal.
- Then what are we talking about?

00:39.541 --> 00:40.625
<i>An introduction.</i>

00:40.625 --> 00:43.000
<i>Your daughter's 13.
She'll soon come of age.</i>

00:43.000 --> 00:44.833
Don't tell me you're taking proposals.

00:44.833 --> 00:47.000
I'm in so much trouble, Vel.

00:47.000 --> 00:49.875
ISB knows Kreegyr's plan.
They'll be waiting for him.

00:49.875 --> 00:54.125
- You think it's worth losing Kreegyr?
- I did.

00:54.125 --> 00:55.375
<i>Calling about Andor.</i>

00:55.375 --> 00:56.833
<i>You wanted news if I had it.</i>

00:56.833 --> 00:58.041
Yes. Please, go on.

00:58.041 --> 01:00.583
<i>The mother.
She's passed away.</i>

01:00.583 --> 01:02.458
<i>He might show up at the funeral.</i>

01:02.458 --> 01:04.500
- <i>They just moved the body.</i>
- What happens now?

01:04.500 --> 01:08.000
<i>As a prominent citizen of Ferrix,
she rates a big send-off.</i>

01:08.000 --> 01:09.666
They'll want to close Rix Road.

01:09.666 --> 01:11.375
You're going to give them a permit.

01:11.375 --> 01:12.458
<i>Cass, I'm sorry.</i>

01:13.666 --> 01:14.708
<i>Your mother's dead.</i>

03:32.000 --> 03:33.000
You're here.

03:33.500 --> 03:35.333
Welcome. And just in time for dinner.

03:35.333 --> 03:36.666
I'll eat later.

03:36.666 --> 03:39.375
I want to get changed,
take a walk around the town.

03:39.375 --> 03:40.500
I'll pull an escort.

03:41.375 --> 03:42.583
No need.

03:42.583 --> 03:44.125
Corv will take me.

03:44.125 --> 03:45.541
Keep it small.

03:45.541 --> 03:46.750
As you wish.

04:16.625 --> 04:17.625
- Xan.
- Hey.

04:17.625 --> 04:20.041
Looked like you were wrapping up,
so I thought I'd wait.

04:20.041 --> 04:22.166
- How long you been here?
- I spoke to Cassian.

04:22.166 --> 04:24.291
- What?
- He called the shop.

04:24.291 --> 04:25.375
How?

04:25.375 --> 04:27.833
Picked up the old box line
and there he was.

04:27.833 --> 04:29.166
- Where?
- I don't know. I...

04:29.166 --> 04:30.625
- Where is he?
- He wouldn't say.

04:32.291 --> 04:33.416
Does he know about Maarva?

04:33.416 --> 04:34.541
Yeah, he does now.

04:35.500 --> 04:37.166
It was a very short conversation.

04:37.750 --> 04:40.458
- He asked about the funeral.
- Let's walk.

04:44.000 --> 04:45.958
- Who else knows this?
- No one.

04:45.958 --> 04:47.250
Keep it that way.

04:47.250 --> 04:48.583
Can't be too careful.

04:48.583 --> 04:50.875
They're watching Maarva's.
Could be anywhere.

04:50.875 --> 04:52.833
He'd be insane to come back now.

04:52.833 --> 04:54.416
I hope you told him that.

04:54.416 --> 04:56.583
Like I said, it was a very short call.

05:46.666 --> 05:50.000
I can't stop thinkin' about
this whole Maarva situation.

05:51.083 --> 05:53.291
Imagine losing you mother like this.

05:55.333 --> 05:56.708
I couldn't stand it.

05:57.625 --> 05:59.250
Not being there for your mom.

05:59.916 --> 06:03.916
Have Brasso place her stone,
just breaks your heart, right?

06:04.958 --> 06:06.291
You gotta feel for Cassian.

06:06.291 --> 06:07.583
I'd be losing my mind.

06:10.416 --> 06:11.416
Want another?

06:13.250 --> 06:14.333
Maybe just one.

06:19.458 --> 06:20.958
Why worry it though?

06:20.958 --> 06:22.666
It's not like he knows about it.

06:22.666 --> 06:25.333
Guarantee you,
he's got no idea what's going on.

06:25.333 --> 06:26.583
Bank on that.

06:26.583 --> 06:28.416
I wouldn't be so sure.

06:29.875 --> 06:30.875
Hey.

06:31.625 --> 06:33.083
You know something I don't?

06:33.083 --> 06:35.708
Do me a favor, keep it that way.

06:43.708 --> 06:44.708
Hey.

06:44.708 --> 06:46.000
We'll have another round.

08:02.666 --> 08:04.041
I thought you left without me.

08:04.958 --> 08:06.458
- Crossed my mind.
- Mmm.

08:06.708 --> 08:09.083
- I looked for you but, uh...
- I'm sure.

08:09.083 --> 08:11.250
Kloris, we'd like privacy, please.

08:11.250 --> 08:12.375
Ma'am.

08:12.791 --> 08:15.208
What now?

08:19.333 --> 08:20.666
You're gambling again.

08:22.541 --> 08:25.416
- Nonsense.
- And here, in Coruscant.

08:25.416 --> 08:26.791
That's ridiculous.

08:26.791 --> 08:29.208
Do you have any idea
how tired of this I am?

08:30.666 --> 08:31.916
(OVER SPEAKER) <i>It's a lie.</i>

08:31.916 --> 08:33.625
<i>It's total fantasy.
Who's telling you this?</i>

08:33.625 --> 08:35.333
- Please.
- No, I'm serious.

08:35.333 --> 08:36.416
Perrin, please.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.250
- Who is saying this?
- Just don't.

08:38.875 --> 08:41.250
We'll go back there, right now.
We'll put it to an end.

08:41.250 --> 08:44.375
We will not.
I've been shamed enough for one night.

08:45.750 --> 08:48.375
You can't live without a casino? Fine.

08:48.375 --> 08:53.958
You go to Canto Bight
and do whatever it is you need to do.

08:54.583 --> 08:55.583
But not here.

08:56.708 --> 08:57.708
You promised.

08:57.708 --> 09:00.250
- I've kept my promise!
- Keep your voice down.

09:00.250 --> 09:02.125
(OVER SPEAKER) <i>He can't hear me.</i>

09:03.541 --> 09:04.541
<i>This is wrong, Mon.</i>

09:04.541 --> 09:07.583
<i>This is people trying to take you down
by coming after me.</i>

09:10.541 --> 09:12.541
You tell me who's saying this
and I'll tell you why.

09:12.541 --> 09:14.083
Oh, please.

09:14.958 --> 09:16.333
Where would I get the money?

09:17.000 --> 09:19.083
That's the question
that scares me the most.

09:21.875 --> 09:23.541
Someone's lying to you.

09:24.666 --> 09:26.166
On that, we can agree.

09:45.625 --> 09:46.916
You're here.

09:48.875 --> 09:50.708
I couldn't remember
if I'd locked the door,

09:50.708 --> 09:52.500
if you'd even remember how to get here.

09:52.500 --> 09:54.750
- And here I am.
- I was on my way to pick you up.

09:54.750 --> 09:56.791
This guy I've been watching, he's ISB.

09:58.916 --> 10:00.458
He's their guy in town.

10:00.458 --> 10:02.125
His boss showed up tonight.

10:03.000 --> 10:04.333
Good to see you too.

10:08.625 --> 10:12.000
An ISB supervisor came in tonight.

10:12.000 --> 10:13.083
A woman.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.125
Here. Now.

10:15.125 --> 10:16.500
I was on my way to pick you up

10:16.500 --> 10:18.583
when they left the hotel
dressed like locals.

10:19.208 --> 10:21.250
I had to follow.

10:22.416 --> 10:23.833
They're getting ready, Vel.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.333
They must know Andor's coming.

10:27.416 --> 10:28.916
You did the right thing.

10:28.916 --> 10:30.375
We have to get there first.

10:31.416 --> 10:32.958
- I know.
- Everything depends on it.

10:32.958 --> 10:34.250
I said I know.

10:41.750 --> 10:43.208
Come away from the window.

11:30.916 --> 11:32.333
<i>Here's the thing, Cassian.</i>

11:32.333 --> 11:35.458
<i>The man who sees everything
is more blessed than cursed.</i>

11:36.500 --> 11:38.583
<i>Look at that. Here we go.</i>

11:38.583 --> 11:40.125
Stand back, let it drip.

11:42.666 --> 11:44.500
Look how quickly that's cleaned up.

11:44.500 --> 11:45.583
Hard to believe, right?

11:46.250 --> 11:47.333
Two minutes.

11:47.333 --> 11:48.625
No longer, no shorter.

11:50.750 --> 11:52.583
You know why
they don't make these anymore?

11:53.083 --> 11:55.583
'Cause they'd rather sell you
a brand new system at ten times the price.

11:55.583 --> 11:57.125
I mean, how many we got?

11:57.125 --> 11:58.666
60? 70 of them?

12:00.333 --> 12:01.333
Just sittin' there.

12:02.041 --> 12:04.375
Five hundred credits each.

12:04.958 --> 12:07.958
People don't look down
to where they should.

12:09.208 --> 12:11.541
They don't look down,
they don't look past the rust.

12:11.541 --> 12:12.791
<i>Not us though, eh?</i>

12:13.750 --> 12:16.166
<i>Eyes open, possibilities everywhere.</i>

12:17.208 --> 12:18.625
Just need to get this cleaned up

12:18.625 --> 12:20.958
before Maarva find us
doing this in the house.

12:47.083 --> 12:48.208
Who's there?

12:51.416 --> 12:53.333
- Cass?
- Pegla?

12:53.333 --> 12:54.583
Down, now!

12:57.333 --> 12:59.250
Huh.

13:00.583 --> 13:02.916
I don't believe it.

13:07.500 --> 13:08.500
Hey.

13:09.625 --> 13:10.625
I'm just...

13:11.208 --> 13:12.458
I'm so sorry.

13:12.458 --> 13:14.208
I loved your mom, I really did.

13:14.208 --> 13:15.541
I know.

13:16.208 --> 13:17.625
It's good to see ya.

13:18.291 --> 13:19.416
What are you doing here?

13:19.416 --> 13:21.666
Just keepin' an eye
on the place till we sell it.

13:21.666 --> 13:22.750
Sell it?

13:24.083 --> 13:25.958
Where's Bix?

13:27.333 --> 13:28.500
Where is she?

13:28.500 --> 13:30.291
Cass...

13:32.458 --> 13:33.458
Where is she?

13:37.458 --> 13:40.375
<i>"There will be times
when the struggle seems impossible.</i>

13:40.375 --> 13:41.541
<i>"I know this already.</i>

13:42.291 --> 13:43.916
<i>"Alone, unsure,</i>

13:43.916 --> 13:46.416
<i>"dwarfed by the scale of the enemy.</i>

13:47.250 --> 13:51.000
<i>"Remember this.
Freedom is a pure idea.</i>

13:52.208 --> 13:55.125
<i>"It occurs spontaneously
and without instruction.</i>

13:55.916 --> 13:59.416
<i>"Random acts of insurrection are occurring
constantly throughout the galaxy.</i>

13:59.416 --> 14:02.500
<i>"There are whole armies,
battalions that have no idea</i>

14:02.500 --> 14:04.750
<i>"that they've already
enlisted in the cause.</i>

14:05.708 --> 14:09.333
<i>"Remember that the frontier
of the Rebellion is everywhere.</i>

14:09.333 --> 14:13.083
<i>"And even the smallest act of insurrection
pushes our lines forward.</i>

14:14.791 --> 14:16.041
<i>"And then remember this.</i>

14:16.833 --> 14:18.750
<i>"The Imperial need
for control is so desperate</i>

14:18.750 --> 14:20.250
<i>"because it is so unnatural.</i>

14:21.416 --> 14:24.041
<i>"Tyranny requires constant effort.</i>

14:24.041 --> 14:26.541
<i>"It breaks, it leaks.</i>

14:27.458 --> 14:29.000
<i>"Authority is brittle.</i>

14:29.000 --> 14:30.833
<i>"Oppression is the mask of fear.</i>

14:32.458 --> 14:33.458
<i>"Remember that.</i>

14:34.291 --> 14:35.625
<i>"And know this,</i>

14:35.625 --> 14:39.083
<i>"the day will come
when all these skirmishes and battles,</i>

14:39.750 --> 14:40.833
<i>"these moments of defiance</i>

14:40.833 --> 14:42.875
<i>"will have flooded the banks
of the Empire's authority</i>

14:42.875 --> 14:45.458
<i>"and then there will be one too many.</i>

14:45.458 --> 14:48.666
<i>"One single thing will break the siege.</i>

14:50.625 --> 14:51.791
<i>"Remember this.</i>

14:53.166 --> 14:54.166
<i>"Try."</i>

15:02.458 --> 15:04.958
We've loosened air traffic
as you requested.

15:04.958 --> 15:08.125
Pulled back our uniform patrols,
relaxed our curfew.

15:08.125 --> 15:10.666
We've baited the trap and opened the door.

15:10.666 --> 15:12.708
We've got recon units
prepped and positioned.

15:12.708 --> 15:14.833
I know you've got
your own sources out there.

15:14.833 --> 15:16.041
What time is the funeral?

15:16.041 --> 15:17.250
They asked for midday.

15:17.250 --> 15:18.708
We pushed it back two hours.

15:18.708 --> 15:20.791
They slow down a bit after lunch.

15:22.083 --> 15:23.250
And the funeral area?

15:23.250 --> 15:25.166
Right there. That's her box.

15:25.166 --> 15:27.791
We're allowing them
half of Rix Road for one block.

15:27.791 --> 15:29.875
We gave them a max of 30 people.

15:29.875 --> 15:32.666
The Daughters pushed back,
so we've upped it to 40.

15:32.666 --> 15:34.000
"Daughters"?

15:34.000 --> 15:35.416
The Daughters of Ferrix.

15:35.416 --> 15:36.625
It's a social club.

15:36.625 --> 15:38.375
Andor's mother was a past president.

15:38.375 --> 15:40.125
A local annoyance.

15:40.125 --> 15:42.666
The control position's here,
here, and here.

15:42.666 --> 15:45.208
We'll have snipers
and a containment unit there.

15:45.208 --> 15:46.750
Containment, yes. Snipers, no.

15:46.750 --> 15:48.375
I want him taken alive.

15:49.291 --> 15:51.583
I want that message passed along the line.

15:51.583 --> 15:52.958
And clearly.

16:22.583 --> 16:24.583
"Where would I get the money?"

16:24.583 --> 16:26.375
"That's what scares me the most."

16:26.375 --> 16:28.583
That's right. Word for word.

16:29.208 --> 16:32.750
Was she more angry about him lying
or the possibility of gambling debts?

16:32.750 --> 16:34.208
Hard to say.

16:34.208 --> 16:37.083
Mon Mothma is of great interest here.

16:37.083 --> 16:41.666
Having her husband dig a hole
for himself could be helpful in many ways.

16:41.666 --> 16:44.208
Well, it sounded like
Perrin had done this before.

16:45.000 --> 16:47.125
They've made some
odd banking moves recently.

16:47.125 --> 16:48.833
This would certainly explain it.

16:49.458 --> 16:51.166
Kreegyr. You're missing it.

16:56.166 --> 16:57.333
Keep listening.

17:05.291 --> 17:07.333
You can close out your Anto Kreegyr files.

17:08.208 --> 17:09.541
How many attacked?

17:09.541 --> 17:11.291
They're still counting the bodies.

17:12.000 --> 17:13.000
It's over?

17:13.000 --> 17:14.208
They walked right into it.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.750
It was over before they started.

17:16.833 --> 17:17.833
Prisoners?

17:18.208 --> 17:19.333
Not today.

17:19.333 --> 17:22.041
Take a guess who's not happy about that.

17:23.791 --> 17:24.833
She called in.

17:25.916 --> 17:27.125
He's been talking her down.

17:27.125 --> 17:30.333
(OVER SPEAKER) <i>I just wish
I had been part of the conversation, sir.</i>

17:30.333 --> 17:32.291
This wasn't a dialogue, Dedra.

17:32.291 --> 17:34.541
We get nothing from a dead body.

17:34.541 --> 17:37.041
Someone needs to be
in the room saying that.

17:37.041 --> 17:38.791
<i>You're missing the point.</i>

17:39.458 --> 17:43.666
Today was about wiping the taste
of Aldhani from the Emperor's mouth.

17:43.666 --> 17:45.458
You want to start a conversation?

17:46.458 --> 17:47.625
Find Axis.

18:47.250 --> 18:48.250
That's not him.

18:48.250 --> 18:50.166
(OVER COMMS) <i>Sir?</i>
The big man.

18:50.166 --> 18:51.291
We've been played.

18:51.875 --> 18:52.916
Where is he?

19:06.958 --> 19:09.166
Okay.

19:10.083 --> 19:11.333
Make it quick.

19:26.750 --> 19:28.250
I wanted her to leave with me.

19:28.250 --> 19:30.041
- I know.
- I came to get her.

19:30.041 --> 19:31.125
She told me.

19:33.333 --> 19:34.500
I couldn't get back.

19:34.500 --> 19:36.500
You shouldn't be here now, Cass.

19:38.250 --> 19:40.708
- But the last time I saw her, we argued.
- Don't.

19:40.708 --> 19:42.750
- I told her I was coming back.
- Stop.

19:42.750 --> 19:45.208
- I never should have left that morning.
- Stop.

19:46.791 --> 19:48.500
She told me you'd say all this.

19:53.708 --> 19:55.958
"Tell him, none of this is his fault.

19:56.791 --> 20:00.125
"It was already burning.
He's just the first spark of the fire.

20:01.125 --> 20:04.166
"Tell him,
he knows everything he needs to know

20:04.166 --> 20:06.208
"and feels everything he needs to feel.

20:07.708 --> 20:10.125
"And when the day comes,
and those two pull together,

20:10.125 --> 20:12.875
"he will be
an unstoppable force for good.

20:15.708 --> 20:16.916
"Tell him...

20:22.208 --> 20:25.041
"I love him more than anything
he could ever do wrong."

20:33.875 --> 20:35.750
- Hey.
- Who's that?

20:40.750 --> 20:43.208
There's different shifts
that they're taking.

20:45.791 --> 20:47.958
Street's clear. Hurry up.

20:49.875 --> 20:52.250
- Bix?
- Still got friends in the hotel.

20:52.250 --> 20:54.958
- She was alive three days ago.
- Why are they keeping her?

20:54.958 --> 20:56.833
She must know something.

20:57.958 --> 21:01.000
We can't just leave her there.

21:01.666 --> 21:03.291
You're gonna take on a full garrison?

21:04.791 --> 21:06.208
I'll take care of Maarva.

21:07.125 --> 21:08.791
You take care of yourself.

21:08.791 --> 21:10.375
It's too late for that.

22:27.041 --> 22:28.041
Any luck?

22:29.416 --> 22:30.458
Was getting worried.

22:32.000 --> 22:34.125
What's the verdict?
Has he come home or not?

22:34.125 --> 22:36.250
They seem to think so.
They're everywhere.

22:37.291 --> 22:40.291
- There's an ISB supervisor in town.
- A woman?

22:41.541 --> 22:42.541
You know her?

22:43.166 --> 22:44.166
Not yet.

22:44.750 --> 22:46.208
This is good.

22:46.208 --> 22:47.916
How is this possibly good?

22:47.916 --> 22:49.541
They'll do the hunting for us.

22:50.208 --> 22:51.250
They'll want him alive.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.958
They'll find him, we'll kill him.

22:53.916 --> 22:55.375
Where will they take him?

22:55.375 --> 22:56.583
The hotel.

22:56.583 --> 22:57.791
So that's our target.

22:58.916 --> 23:01.750
We just need him dead
before they start asking questions.

23:03.666 --> 23:05.833
How long do we have
before the festivities start?

23:05.833 --> 23:07.791
Few hours. You'll hear the anvil.

23:08.458 --> 23:10.375
- Where's Cinta?
- Watching the mother's house.

23:10.375 --> 23:12.375
Oh, forget that.
Get her up to the hotel.

23:12.375 --> 23:13.708
I'll have a look around.

23:19.041 --> 23:20.333
What's going on?

23:44.791 --> 23:46.666
Get Cinta. I'll be at the hotel.

24:13.916 --> 24:14.916
What's going on?

24:15.833 --> 24:16.833
I'm not sure.

24:45.583 --> 24:46.875
(OVER COMMS) <i>I can hear music, sir.</i>

26:07.458 --> 26:08.833
<i>Of course I hear it.</i>

26:10.583 --> 26:11.625
I'm just not seeing it.

26:12.708 --> 26:14.958
They've started.
They're coming from all over town.

26:14.958 --> 26:16.708
I want everything out here.

26:16.708 --> 26:18.333
Show of force immediately.

26:22.833 --> 26:24.291
Stand to!

26:24.291 --> 26:26.833
Double time, form up.

26:26.833 --> 26:28.041
Let's move!

26:50.125 --> 26:52.208
You call this a perimeter?

26:53.583 --> 26:55.541
Square this away!

26:55.541 --> 26:58.750
Get these people off the streets.

26:58.750 --> 27:00.125
Team one here.

27:00.125 --> 27:02.000
Team two here.
Go, go, go!

27:02.000 --> 27:03.291
Team three...

27:04.541 --> 27:06.291
Restrict them!

27:06.291 --> 27:09.041
Move! Move! Move!

27:11.166 --> 27:12.250
Go, go, go!

27:13.375 --> 27:15.291
Move! Move! Move!

27:18.166 --> 27:19.625
Take a unit down there.

27:21.708 --> 27:23.541
You, Captain, take them that way.

27:42.416 --> 27:44.375
- Double the reward.
- You found him?

27:44.375 --> 27:47.041
I want twice as much
and a ride out of here when it's over.

27:47.041 --> 27:49.000
- Where is he?
- Pretend you're arresting me.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.625
- Hey!
- What do you think you're doing?

27:50.625 --> 27:52.208
Hey. Move it. Move!

28:04.458 --> 28:06.291
Right,
we need to assume the positions.

28:06.291 --> 28:07.583
Secure the perimeter.

28:16.750 --> 28:18.291
Back!

28:39.750 --> 28:41.625
- Which building?
- Across the street.

28:41.625 --> 28:43.041
I need two men.
He's seen him?

28:43.041 --> 28:45.125
- No, but he's sure he's there.
- We're wasting time.

28:45.125 --> 28:47.125
I've got a recon unit
on the terrace up there now...

28:47.125 --> 28:48.583
No. I need him alive.

28:48.583 --> 28:50.666
Don't make me say it again.

29:49.958 --> 29:51.125
Sir.

29:51.125 --> 29:52.208
She's here.

29:53.166 --> 29:54.541
It's her.

30:58.208 --> 31:01.166
- What are we doing?
- We're wasting time.

31:40.625 --> 31:46.291
Stone and sky. Stone and sky...

31:58.708 --> 32:00.833
Stone and sky.

32:15.000 --> 32:17.208
- Tenek.
- Cassian.

32:17.208 --> 32:19.333
Where's Bix?

32:22.000 --> 32:23.416
I'm sorry about your mother.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.291
<i>My name is Maarva Carassi Andor.</i>

32:46.333 --> 32:48.791
<i>I'm honored to stand before you.</i>

32:50.875 --> 32:53.125
<i>I'm honored
to be a Daughter of Ferrix,</i>

32:54.250 --> 32:56.291
<i>and honored to be worthy of the stone.</i>

32:59.083 --> 33:00.125
<i>Strange, I...</i>

33:03.541 --> 33:05.000
<i>feel as if I can see it.</i>

33:09.041 --> 33:13.583
<i>I was six, I think,
first time I touched a funerary stone.</i>

33:15.916 --> 33:19.208
<i>Heard our music, felt our history.</i>

33:20.958 --> 33:24.666
<i>Holding my sister's hand as we walked
all the way from Fountain Square.</i>

33:26.458 --> 33:30.500
<i>Where you stand now,
I've been more times than I can remember.</i>

33:32.541 --> 33:34.416
<i>I always wanted to be lifted.</i>

33:36.750 --> 33:40.208
<i>I was always eager,
always waiting to be inspired.</i>

33:41.750 --> 33:46.375
<i>I remember every time it happened,
every time the dead lifted me...</i>

33:51.291 --> 33:52.500
<i>With their truth.</i>

33:59.375 --> 34:00.666
<i>And now I'm dead.</i>

34:03.416 --> 34:04.958
<i>And I yearn to lift you.</i>

34:06.250 --> 34:09.541
<i>Not because I want to shine
or even be remembered.</i>

34:10.500 --> 34:13.625
<i>It's because I want you to go on.</i>

34:14.416 --> 34:17.000
<i>I want Ferrix to continue.</i>

34:17.875 --> 34:21.750
<i>In my waning hours,
that's what comforts me most.</i>

34:23.041 --> 34:24.083
<i>But I fear for you.</i>

34:26.458 --> 34:27.500
<i>We've been sleeping.</i>

34:30.000 --> 34:34.166
<i>We've had each other,
and Ferrix, our work, our days.</i>

34:34.166 --> 34:36.375
<i>We had each other, and they left us alone.</i>

34:36.375 --> 34:40.208
<i>We kept the trade lanes open,
and they left us alone.</i>

34:41.666 --> 34:43.833
<i>We took their money and ignored them,</i>

34:43.833 --> 34:45.250
<i>we kept their engines churning,</i>

34:45.250 --> 34:47.958
<i>and the moment they pulled away,
we forgot them.</i>

34:49.958 --> 34:52.625
<i>Because we had each other.</i>

34:55.625 --> 34:56.625
<i>We had Ferrix.</i>

35:00.750 --> 35:01.875
<i>But we were sleeping.</i>

35:03.375 --> 35:04.416
<i>I've been sleeping.</i>

35:06.458 --> 35:09.583
<i>And I've been turning away from the truth
I wanted not to face.</i>

35:11.708 --> 35:15.541
<i>There is a wound that won't heal
at the center of the galaxy.</i>

35:16.583 --> 35:22.750
<i>There is a darkness reaching like rust
into everything around us.</i>

35:22.750 --> 35:24.625
<i>We let it grow, and now it's here.</i>

35:26.708 --> 35:30.666
<i>It's here, and it's not visiting anymore.</i>

35:32.875 --> 35:34.250
<i>It wants to stay.</i>

35:37.583 --> 35:42.333
<i>The Empire is a disease
that thrives in darkness,</i>

35:42.333 --> 35:45.666
<i>it is never more alive than when we sleep.</i>

35:50.166 --> 35:53.083
<i>It's easy for the dead
to tell you to fight,</i>

35:53.083 --> 35:56.125
<i>and maybe it's true,
maybe fighting is useless.</i>

36:00.208 --> 36:01.625
<i>Perhaps it's too late.</i>

36:05.583 --> 36:06.916
<i>But I'll tell you this...</i>

36:09.708 --> 36:11.333
<i>If I could do it again,</i>

36:12.208 --> 36:18.291
<i>I'd wake up early
and be fighting these bastards...</i>

36:18.291 --> 36:19.750
Move!

36:19.750 --> 36:22.500
<i>...from the start.</i>

36:23.750 --> 36:25.166
<i>Fight the Empire!</i>

36:25.166 --> 36:26.625
Enough!

36:32.750 --> 36:34.333
No!

36:38.166 --> 36:39.791
Placement!

36:56.125 --> 36:58.791
Let him through!
Hold the line!

36:58.791 --> 37:02.458
Let him through!

37:02.458 --> 37:04.458
Let him through.

37:04.458 --> 37:05.833
Hold the line!

37:07.083 --> 37:08.458
Hold the line!

37:13.666 --> 37:16.833
You! Bell tower, make it stop now!

37:16.833 --> 37:18.416
Go!

37:18.416 --> 37:19.833
Hold the line!

37:29.916 --> 37:31.291
I dreamt you came back.

37:33.041 --> 37:34.041
Bix?

37:35.541 --> 37:36.916
You climbed over a wall.

37:39.458 --> 37:43.458
Hey, listen, we gotta get outta here.

37:43.458 --> 37:45.041
Maarva was here.

37:49.500 --> 37:50.666
Wasn't she great?

38:00.750 --> 38:02.750
Get him up!

38:07.250 --> 38:10.250
Move, move!

38:15.041 --> 38:16.625
There's no one out there. Come on.

38:18.291 --> 38:19.375
They'll get angry.

38:21.625 --> 38:22.625
No.

38:50.791 --> 38:52.083
Ah!

39:17.125 --> 39:18.208
Oh, my God...

39:25.750 --> 39:27.500
Come. Come.

39:27.500 --> 39:28.750
There you go.

39:33.958 --> 39:35.708
Come on, let's get moving. Come on.

39:37.416 --> 39:38.416
Keep moving!

39:39.958 --> 39:41.500
There! That's him!

39:41.500 --> 39:42.708
Get him!

39:47.958 --> 39:50.250
- Hold the line!
- Open fire!

39:51.583 --> 39:53.750
Fire at will!

40:09.166 --> 40:10.958
Come on!

40:12.791 --> 40:14.041
- Move!
- Get him!

40:18.500 --> 40:20.375
Ah!

40:25.875 --> 40:27.041
Ah!

40:53.208 --> 40:54.875
You.

40:54.875 --> 40:57.541
What are you doing here?

41:26.583 --> 41:27.708
Okay.

42:38.625 --> 42:40.416
Do as I say. Move!

42:41.500 --> 42:43.125
Straight ahead. Through the door.

42:44.000 --> 42:45.458
Quickly!

42:49.708 --> 42:50.708
You?

42:51.916 --> 42:53.250
How?

42:54.833 --> 42:56.250
You were in trouble.

43:03.791 --> 43:04.791
Syril.

43:04.791 --> 43:05.916
I knew that.

43:14.166 --> 43:15.583
I should...

43:15.583 --> 43:17.166
I should say thank you.

43:19.291 --> 43:20.458
You don't have to.

43:45.916 --> 43:47.208
What about this?

43:47.208 --> 43:48.583
Everything goes.

43:48.583 --> 43:50.541
- Closet?
- Empty.

43:55.916 --> 43:57.625
- You're bleeding.
- It's fine.

43:57.625 --> 43:58.708
That's blood.

43:58.708 --> 43:59.791
It's nothing.

44:02.333 --> 44:03.625
It's not mine.

44:09.833 --> 44:11.125
Come on, guys.

44:11.125 --> 44:12.666
The fuel gauge says zero.

44:12.666 --> 44:14.208
I've got nothing.

44:15.125 --> 44:17.541
It's topped out. It's reading full.

44:18.125 --> 44:19.708
Do you wanna come up here and see?

44:19.708 --> 44:22.750
Bang the gauge, Jezz.
Just give it a whack.

44:24.583 --> 44:28.583
It's got a few kinks,
but it's a good old ship.

44:28.583 --> 44:30.500
I'd have more confidence
if you were coming.

44:32.458 --> 44:33.791
It flies.

44:35.583 --> 44:37.625
Pull it! Pull it!

44:39.583 --> 44:40.958
We're full!

44:44.708 --> 44:45.958
Give me those.

44:45.958 --> 44:49.000
Now, go.
You go now or forget it.

44:49.625 --> 44:50.791
No.

44:59.958 --> 45:01.416
C-C-Cassian.

45:02.708 --> 45:04.208
- Get it going!
- Almost there.

45:05.625 --> 45:07.458
Hey.

45:08.208 --> 45:10.375
- Help her up.
- Brasso.

45:11.041 --> 45:12.541
She's coming around. Come on.

45:13.750 --> 45:15.041
Let's get moving!

45:15.041 --> 45:17.291
Come. Come with me.

45:23.000 --> 45:24.583
- Hey, Jezz.
- Hey, Cass.

45:24.583 --> 45:26.250
Can they make it to Gangi Moon?

45:26.250 --> 45:27.833
If they ever make it out of here.

45:28.958 --> 45:29.958
You're not coming?

45:30.791 --> 45:32.875
Stay low all the way to Farside Sea.

45:32.875 --> 45:35.291
The moment you get over the water,
you climb.

45:36.041 --> 45:38.500
Straight home, full pump,
hand throttle, no comms.

45:39.500 --> 45:41.833
All in. You understand?

45:41.833 --> 45:43.166
Yeah.

45:43.166 --> 45:44.791
You're n-n-not coming?

45:45.375 --> 45:46.500
Not today, Bee.

45:46.500 --> 45:48.875
I n-n-never got to see you.

45:49.750 --> 45:52.125
You take care of Bix until I get there.

45:52.125 --> 45:53.250
I'm counting on you.

45:54.250 --> 45:55.666
You always say that.

45:56.875 --> 45:58.500
And you always come through.

45:59.875 --> 46:01.375
Get them out of here!

46:02.041 --> 46:03.166
He'll find us.

46:07.041 --> 46:08.416
Cassian will find us.

46:10.541 --> 46:12.583
I will.

46:20.416 --> 46:21.416
I'll find you.

46:23.333 --> 46:24.958
Now, go! Go, go!

47:59.541 --> 48:00.625
Prepare for evac.

48:00.625 --> 48:01.708
Full stealth.

48:25.958 --> 48:28.083
You came here to kill me, didn't you?

48:30.166 --> 48:31.375
You don't make it easy.

48:35.291 --> 48:36.375
I will now.

48:53.958 --> 48:55.333
What game is this?

48:57.625 --> 48:58.625
No game.

49:03.583 --> 49:04.583
Kill me.

49:08.208 --> 49:09.458
Or take me in.
