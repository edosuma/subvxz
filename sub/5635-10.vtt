00:20.647 --> 00:22.314
And your heart rate is... six?

00:22.315 --> 00:23.949
I might have missed a couple.

00:23.950 --> 00:26.786
You know what they say
in medicine... close enough.

00:26.787 --> 00:28.354
Moving on to the hearing test.

00:28.355 --> 00:29.988
Raise your hand
when you hear the tone.

00:30.023 --> 00:31.624
Ah...

00:31.625 --> 00:33.324
I smell it, but I don't hear it.

00:33.360 --> 00:35.360
Tina, what are you doing?
Practicing.

00:35.395 --> 00:37.063
I'm earing my Thundergirls
nursing patch

00:37.064 --> 00:38.831
by helping out
the new school nurse today.

00:38.832 --> 00:41.133
If anyone should be getting
a nursing patch, it's me.

00:41.134 --> 00:42.534
I nursed forever.

00:42.569 --> 00:44.470
Yeah, you did,
my little suckling duckling.

00:44.471 --> 00:46.037
Good times.

00:46.073 --> 00:48.007
I'm only allowed to dispense
ice and Band-Aids,

00:48.008 --> 00:50.543
but I think I'll get
a lot out of it.

00:50.544 --> 00:52.311
(machine beeping steadily,
groaning)

00:52.312 --> 00:53.412
It's butt fever.

00:53.413 --> 00:54.980
Worst case I've ever seen.

00:54.981 --> 00:56.649
His butt won't make it
though the night.

00:56.650 --> 00:58.484
Not on my watch.

00:58.485 --> 00:59.685
Starting compressions.

00:59.686 --> 01:01.320
Doctor, I need 50 cc's of ice.

01:01.321 --> 01:02.721
Live, damn it, live!

01:02.756 --> 01:04.657
(beeping resumes)

01:04.658 --> 01:06.158
It's a miracle.

01:06.159 --> 01:08.527
So anyway, I've got
a real zeal to heal.

01:08.528 --> 01:10.663
Here we go.
What's in the box, Bob?

01:10.664 --> 01:12.130
Whatever it is, I call dibs.

01:12.165 --> 01:13.899
- Well, something kind of exciting.
- What?

01:13.900 --> 01:15.735
New stool tops.
Oh.

01:15.736 --> 01:17.236
Look.
Oh.

01:17.237 --> 01:19.004
Nice, huh?
Yeah.

01:19.005 --> 01:21.473
No cracks, no tears,
a little more cushion.

01:21.508 --> 01:23.028
Is that what you said
when you met Mom?

01:23.043 --> 01:24.110
Now, which-which one's
the old one?

01:24.111 --> 01:25.578
The new one...
R-Really?

01:25.579 --> 01:26.579
Well, the one
that he's holding is the...

01:26.580 --> 01:28.380
No, this is the new one.

01:28.381 --> 01:30.015
- This is the old one, obviously.
- That's the...

01:30.016 --> 01:32.384
Oh, that's the old... new one.
No, this one.

01:32.385 --> 01:34.420
- Oh,<i> that's</i> the new one.
- Oh,<i> that's</i> the new... They look...

01:34.421 --> 01:36.222
- Yes, the one that's not attached.
- New one's not attached.

01:36.223 --> 01:38.691
I like it cha... it changes it,
but it doesn't change it.

01:38.692 --> 01:40.526
Yeah, it's like you
cloned the stools

01:40.527 --> 01:42.561
and did nothing
to improve them...

01:42.562 --> 01:43.796
But made 'em better. Right.

01:43.797 --> 01:45.531
Yeah, right.

01:45.532 --> 01:47.066
You people don't understand.

01:47.067 --> 01:49.268
Well, let's give
the old stools one last spin.

01:49.269 --> 01:50.603
Whee! Ow.

01:50.604 --> 01:52.238
I'll get the ice.

01:52.239 --> 01:53.272
<i>Patient is male.</i>

01:53.273 --> 01:54.739
13. Wrestling injury.

01:54.775 --> 01:56.207
Sneaker versus crotch.

01:56.243 --> 01:57.543
Oh, God, still don't know

01:57.544 --> 01:58.978
how I kicked myself
in the beans.

01:58.979 --> 02:00.712
But that's wrestling
for you. Oh.

02:00.747 --> 02:03.448
Groin kick, great.
I'll call for a medevac.

02:03.483 --> 02:04.650
Get me some of
that orange-flavored

02:04.651 --> 02:06.451
chewable baby aspirin, stat!

02:06.486 --> 02:08.386
Nurse Liz isn't
a Nurse Feel-Good, Zeke.

02:08.420 --> 02:10.755
Oh, she's giving you some.
(sighs)

02:10.791 --> 02:12.158
Pretty slow today.

02:12.159 --> 02:13.926
Well, a slow day
in the nurse's office

02:13.927 --> 02:15.527
is a good day, right?
Wrong.

02:15.562 --> 02:17.062
Tina, I didn't become
a school nurse

02:17.063 --> 02:19.097
because no hospital
would hire me.

02:19.132 --> 02:20.933
Course not.
I mean, that was part of it,

02:20.934 --> 02:23.302
but I got into nursing
to help seriously sick kids.

02:23.303 --> 02:25.604
But kids have to do their part
and get seriously sick.

02:25.605 --> 02:27.106
I get it.

02:27.107 --> 02:28.774
You want your life
to be like <i> Hurt Locker</i>

02:28.775 --> 02:30.475
but nobody's
getting hurt by their locker.

02:30.510 --> 02:33.846
Exactly. It's always
scraped this and bruised that.

02:33.847 --> 02:36.481
And never epidemic this
or outbreak that.

02:36.516 --> 02:38.017
Well, maybe things will pick up.

02:38.018 --> 02:39.618
You never know who's
got cooties, right?

02:39.619 --> 02:41.653
(chuckles weakly) Hmm.

02:41.688 --> 02:43.122
A gentleman I've been seeing

02:43.123 --> 02:45.624
says I should
be more spontaneous,

02:45.625 --> 02:47.325
so I'm starting right now.

02:47.360 --> 02:49.128
Pop quiz.

02:49.129 --> 02:50.228
Pop quiz?

02:51.531 --> 02:53.585
Ms. LaBonz,
do I look sweaty to you?

02:53.586 --> 02:55.134
I'm feeling kind of hot

02:55.135 --> 02:56.134
and vomity.

02:56.169 --> 02:57.468
Well, that happened fast.

02:57.504 --> 02:58.771
Your quiz happened fast.

02:58.772 --> 03:00.271
Fast things happen.

03:00.307 --> 03:01.774
Maybe I should go
to the nurse's office,

03:01.775 --> 03:03.008
if I can make it.

03:03.009 --> 03:04.777
I'm so woozy. Oh.

03:04.778 --> 03:06.712
Whoops. Excuse me, sorry.

03:06.713 --> 03:08.147
Am I there yet?

03:08.148 --> 03:09.648
Just go already, Louise.

03:09.649 --> 03:10.983
Is that you, Grandma?

03:10.984 --> 03:12.218
I'm in the barn.

03:12.219 --> 03:13.585
Go.

03:13.620 --> 03:15.286
My inhaler's almost empty.

03:15.322 --> 03:17.289
Tommy LaCroix thought
it was an air freshener

03:17.290 --> 03:19.324
and took it
into the bathroom with him.

03:19.359 --> 03:21.026
We don't have
any extra inhalers, Rudy,

03:21.027 --> 03:23.195
but how about this?
Hold your arms over your head

03:23.196 --> 03:24.897
and only breathe
when you need to.

03:24.898 --> 03:27.299
Okay. Here we go.

03:27.300 --> 03:28.801
(groans) I needed to.

03:28.802 --> 03:29.902
Oh, hi, Louise.

03:29.903 --> 03:31.269
Hi, I have, like,

03:31.304 --> 03:33.839
a 45-minute bug
I picked up first period.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.274
Or maybe it's a popped quizula.

03:36.309 --> 03:38.309
Oh, my God, is winking
one of the symptoms?

03:38.345 --> 03:40.412
Yeah. I'm just gonna
park it over here

03:40.413 --> 03:43.214
until I make a miraculous
recovery after this nap.

03:43.250 --> 03:45.584
(sighs) I'm so sick
of people not being sick.

03:45.585 --> 03:47.186
Well, the important thing

03:47.187 --> 03:48.821
is we're here when someone
really needs us.

03:48.822 --> 03:51.055
Hello. I was in P.E.
and we were gonna climb ropes

03:51.091 --> 03:53.058
and I began to feel
a little gouty.

03:53.059 --> 03:54.260
(sighs)

03:54.261 --> 03:55.261
You're nice.

03:55.262 --> 03:56.728
I'm cramping.

03:56.763 --> 03:57.862
That's the last one.

03:57.898 --> 03:59.031
Wow, I hardly

03:59.032 --> 04:00.099
recognize the place.

04:00.100 --> 04:01.433
Where am I?

04:01.434 --> 04:03.168
(sighs)
Go ahead, Teddy, try one out.

04:03.169 --> 04:05.370
Yeah, be our stool sampler.

04:05.405 --> 04:08.039
Well, I'd be honored. Oh.
(stool farting)

04:08.074 --> 04:09.375
Teddy.
Jeez!

04:09.376 --> 04:11.075
You really planted
your flag in that thing.

04:11.111 --> 04:12.911
That wasn't me!
It came out of the stool!

04:12.946 --> 04:13.779
Mm, sure.

04:13.780 --> 04:15.247
No, really. Look.

04:15.248 --> 04:16.380
(stool farts)

04:16.416 --> 04:17.415
Oh, no.

04:17.450 --> 04:18.450
(stool farts)

04:18.451 --> 04:19.685
This one farts, too.

04:19.685 --> 04:21.387
(stools farting)
So does this one.

04:21.387 --> 04:22.888
And this one.

04:22.889 --> 04:23.889
But not this one.
(stool farts)

04:23.890 --> 04:24.957
Oh, this one does, too.

04:24.958 --> 04:26.892
Oh, no, no.
They all do it.

04:26.893 --> 04:28.794
They look sweet,
but they're full of farts.

04:28.795 --> 04:30.194
Just like the kids.

04:30.230 --> 04:31.697
Ugh.

04:31.698 --> 04:33.766
What's up, universal nerd care.
(chuckles)

04:33.767 --> 04:35.033
Hey, Tam-Tam.

04:35.068 --> 04:36.268
You're all that in a hat.

04:36.269 --> 04:37.636
Seriously, way to accessorize.

04:37.637 --> 04:38.737
Yeah, I'm doing indoor hats now.

04:38.738 --> 04:39.905
It's a game changer.

04:39.906 --> 04:40.906
Hi, Tammy.
What's wrong?

04:40.907 --> 04:42.074
My nails are gross.

04:42.075 --> 04:43.708
Can someone here file them?

04:43.743 --> 04:45.343
- TINA: Um, that's not really what we do.
- Hmm.

04:45.378 --> 04:47.612
Oh, um, it will be
when you do it.

04:47.647 --> 04:50.214
I notice you're
scratching your head.

04:50.250 --> 04:51.884
Yeah, maybe I'm trying
to think of something.

04:51.885 --> 04:53.552
Now I'm wearing a hat.

04:53.553 --> 04:54.954
Hey, hats are fun.

04:54.955 --> 04:56.755
Whoa, as advertised.

04:56.756 --> 04:58.390
What's so fun about this?

04:58.391 --> 04:59.658
Oh.

04:59.659 --> 05:01.794
(yawns)
Well, I think I'm through

05:01.795 --> 05:03.628
the most quizzical part
of my illness.

05:03.663 --> 05:04.897
Good day.

05:04.898 --> 05:05.931
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hey, Louise!

05:05.932 --> 05:06.932
We got a fun hat.

05:06.933 --> 05:08.233
I already got a fun hat.

05:08.234 --> 05:09.802
Keep yours company.
Come on, girl.

05:09.803 --> 05:11.803
- Zeke.
- Now let's all switch shoes.

05:11.838 --> 05:13.172
Don't know
why you'd be scratching.

05:13.173 --> 05:14.306
Unless it's...

05:14.307 --> 05:15.341
(gasps) It could be.

05:15.342 --> 05:16.408
Oh, my God, yes.

05:16.409 --> 05:17.509
Lice!

05:17.510 --> 05:19.744
Like <i> lice</i> lice?

05:19.779 --> 05:22.547
That hat's infected.
You're all exposed!

05:22.582 --> 05:25.284
We're in quarantine, people!

05:25.285 --> 05:26.852
"Quarantine"?
No, I was actually just...

05:26.853 --> 05:28.454
Hot crap, it is on!

05:28.455 --> 05:29.755
No!

05:29.756 --> 05:30.989
Tina, put a rubber glove
on your head.

05:31.024 --> 05:32.623
Oh, I'm doing that, too? Okay.

05:32.659 --> 05:35.927
Ms. LaBonz, I'm ready
to take the pop quiz!

05:35.962 --> 05:37.745
Ms. LaBonz!

05:40.168 --> 05:43.274
I can't believe
Tammy gave us lice!

05:43.275 --> 05:45.042
I'm itchier
than a pair of burlap pants.

05:45.043 --> 05:47.344
I can't have lice.
I go to private school.

05:47.345 --> 05:49.346
This is public school.
What?!

05:49.347 --> 05:50.881
I just hope my body
is strong enough

05:50.882 --> 05:53.217
to fight off lice
and asthma at the same time.

05:53.218 --> 05:55.152
(wheezing): Nope.

05:55.153 --> 05:56.620
Tina, I don't like this.

05:56.621 --> 05:58.122
I have that thing
where I can't stand

05:58.123 --> 05:59.437
huge tables blocking doors.

05:59.457 --> 06:00.825
Oh, you've never mentioned that.

06:00.826 --> 06:02.526
Nurse Liz, can I borrow
some cotton balls

06:02.527 --> 06:05.795
to re-stuff my obesity puppet,
Portion Control Joel?

06:05.831 --> 06:07.398
What's, uh, going on?

06:07.399 --> 06:09.867
We have a serious lice outbreak
at Wagstaff, Mr. Frond.

06:09.868 --> 06:12.669
Okay, so we phone the parents
and get the kids picked up.

06:12.704 --> 06:14.305
We <i> could</i> call parents.

06:14.306 --> 06:16.773
But let me tell you what
I'm hoping for... afraid of.

06:16.808 --> 06:18.875
Superlice.
"Superlice"?

06:18.910 --> 06:20.043
Super what?

06:20.078 --> 06:21.645
It's a strain of lice

06:21.646 --> 06:23.214
that's evolved
to be treatment-resistant.

06:23.215 --> 06:25.015
Every time it's not
completely destroyed,

06:25.016 --> 06:27.350
it comes back even stronger.

06:27.385 --> 06:28.484
Like Mark Harmon.

06:28.520 --> 06:29.653
Oh, my God.

06:29.654 --> 06:30.754
Parents can't handle superlice.

06:30.755 --> 06:32.756
Parents helped create superlice.

06:32.757 --> 06:34.191
Parents are stupid.

06:34.192 --> 06:36.026
Or maybe you love parents.

06:36.027 --> 06:38.262
I d... I don't.
Parents are terrible.

06:38.263 --> 06:40.030
Then we keep them out of it
and handle it here.

06:40.031 --> 06:41.464
That's the plan.

06:41.499 --> 06:42.899
That doesn't seem
like a good plan...

06:42.934 --> 06:44.568
Tina, don't be a giant bummer.

06:44.569 --> 06:45.668
We're doing the plan.

06:45.704 --> 06:47.203
BOB: <i>Yes, a fart sound.</i>

06:47.239 --> 06:48.405
Listen to it again.

06:48.406 --> 06:49.540
(stool farts)

06:49.541 --> 06:51.242
No, that was the stool.

06:51.243 --> 06:52.509
I want them fixed.

06:52.510 --> 06:53.510
Bobby, I installed them.

06:53.511 --> 06:54.510
Let me talk to him.

06:54.512 --> 06:55.679
Hi, this is Teddy.

06:55.680 --> 06:57.081
Bob's handyman and best friend.

06:57.082 --> 06:59.015
I know, I know.
He can get a little hot.

06:59.050 --> 07:00.718
Mediterranean blood, you know?

07:00.719 --> 07:02.219
I'm not Mediterranean.

07:02.220 --> 07:03.687
Oh, I got it!

07:03.688 --> 07:05.289
We hire someone to play
the trumpet real loud

07:05.290 --> 07:06.557
any time anyone sits down.

07:06.558 --> 07:07.625
They'll never know.

07:07.626 --> 07:08.658
(groans)

07:08.693 --> 07:09.793
Well, that explains everything.

07:09.794 --> 07:11.295
That's so simple.

07:11.296 --> 07:12.296
Why didn't I think of that?

07:12.297 --> 07:14.298
Okay, bye-bye.
Well?

07:14.299 --> 07:16.055
The guy says
the stools just do that.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.234
They just do that?

07:17.235 --> 07:18.535
Well, until they're broken in.

07:18.536 --> 07:19.703
A year or two tops.

07:19.704 --> 07:21.238
"A year or two"?

07:21.239 --> 07:23.040
We-we can't be
the farty stool restaurant.

07:23.041 --> 07:24.540
That's not good for business.

07:24.576 --> 07:26.477
Oh, we're gonna have
to break them in ourselves.

07:26.478 --> 07:27.645
Good idea, Bobby.

07:27.646 --> 07:29.212
All butts on deck, come on!

07:29.247 --> 07:30.247
(stool farting)

07:30.248 --> 07:31.282
Can you move down one, Bob?

07:31.283 --> 07:32.415
I'd like a little privacy.

07:34.753 --> 07:36.219
To get a handle
on this superlice outbreak,

07:36.254 --> 07:37.955
we need to know who else

07:37.956 --> 07:39.957
has been exposed
to Tammy's hair.

07:39.958 --> 07:42.726
Great idea, why don't you let me
out and I'll comb the hallways.

07:42.727 --> 07:43.994
(laughs) No pun intended.

07:43.995 --> 07:45.061
We have fun.

07:45.096 --> 07:46.096
Open the door.
(stammers)

07:46.097 --> 07:47.196
You open it.
No, No.

07:47.232 --> 07:48.399
I will not.
Yeah, I got this.

07:48.400 --> 07:49.500
(stammers) You can't do that.

07:49.501 --> 07:51.101
You stay put.
(groans)

07:51.102 --> 07:52.836
I know.
Tammy, give me your phone.

07:52.837 --> 07:54.672
You can give someone lice
over the phone?

07:54.673 --> 07:56.773
Oh, prank calls
just got fun again.

07:56.808 --> 07:58.742
No, selfies.

07:58.743 --> 08:00.743
They thought they were posing
for a picture with Tammy's head.

08:00.779 --> 08:02.512
What they got was so much more.

08:04.082 --> 08:05.416
Hi, it's Jocelyn.

08:05.417 --> 08:07.418
Live from the nurse's office.

08:07.419 --> 08:09.320
I'm filling in for Tammy,
'cause guys,

08:09.321 --> 08:11.455
Tammy's got superlice!

08:11.456 --> 08:12.589
(muttering)

08:12.590 --> 08:13.958
Hi, Tammy. I see you.

08:13.959 --> 08:15.092
Hurry up and get better.

08:15.093 --> 08:16.827
No, take your time, ha.

08:16.828 --> 08:18.362
I'm here with Nurse Liz.

08:18.363 --> 08:20.597
So, what are superlice?

08:20.598 --> 08:22.866
- Well Jocelyn, they're parasites.
- Ew.

08:22.867 --> 08:24.768
They live on your hair
and chew your head and

08:24.769 --> 08:26.402
and then drink the blood out
of your scalp...

08:26.403 --> 08:27.871
- by sucking it out...
- Shut up!

08:27.872 --> 08:29.640
Using their little
louse bodies as straws.

08:29.641 --> 08:30.874
(slurping) Oh, my God!
Stop talking!

08:30.875 --> 08:33.344
And then they poop
on you, Jocelyn.

08:33.345 --> 08:35.446
And lay millions of lice eggs.
(retching)

08:35.447 --> 08:37.715
I'm gonna throw up.

08:37.716 --> 08:39.783
Kids with lice are bad, right?

08:39.784 --> 08:42.186
(laughs) No, they aren't bad.

08:42.187 --> 08:43.886
But they are disgusting.

08:43.888 --> 08:45.788
And we want to protect
their identity.

08:45.824 --> 08:48.692
Unrelated...
will the following 16 children

08:48.693 --> 08:52.463
report to the nurse's office
for a, uh, neck exam?

08:52.464 --> 08:54.031
Jimmy Pesto Jr., Lice.

08:54.032 --> 08:55.332
Lenny Destefano, Lice.

08:55.333 --> 08:56.800
Michael Carlish, Licey.

08:56.801 --> 08:58.701
Tracy Schwartz.
Super licey.

08:58.737 --> 09:00.636
So, you'd like to reserve
the whole restaurant?

09:00.672 --> 09:02.139
Mm-hmm.
For a post-funeral meal?

09:02.140 --> 09:03.807
Mm-hmm.
Today?

09:03.808 --> 09:05.976
It's short notice,
but the mortician next door

09:05.977 --> 09:07.344
recommended you highly.

09:07.345 --> 09:08.412
(stool farting) Oh.

09:08.413 --> 09:10.046
Sorry for your loss.

09:10.081 --> 09:12.216
Lin, take a break.
Oh, sorry.

09:12.217 --> 09:13.684
Uh, excuse us,
we're just in the process of,

09:13.685 --> 09:16.953
of, uh, calibrating our,
uh, sitting equipment.

09:16.988 --> 09:19.056
Yes, it would be
about a dozen people.

09:19.057 --> 09:20.391
Some of them are elderly

09:20.392 --> 09:23.059
and obviously grieving.
(stool farting)

09:23.094 --> 09:24.828
Teddy, stop.
W-We'll be ready.

09:24.829 --> 09:26.230
By 2:00.
Oh, my God.

09:26.231 --> 09:27.331
I mean, I'll, yes.

09:27.332 --> 09:28.365
See you then.

09:28.366 --> 09:29.699
Have a great funeral!

09:31.169 --> 09:33.236
Tammy's selfies
sure liced a lot of kids.

09:33.271 --> 09:35.538
Yep, these selfies
went viral, literally.

09:35.573 --> 09:37.441
My lice are going
over to Andy's head.

09:37.442 --> 09:39.376
And my lice are going
over to Ollie's head.

09:39.377 --> 09:41.711
Bye, hello, bye!
Hello, bye, hello!

09:41.746 --> 09:43.113
One, two, three... oh, God!

09:43.114 --> 09:44.882
That's a lot heavier
than I expected.

09:44.883 --> 09:46.750
Louise, I don't think you're
supposed to move that table.

09:46.751 --> 09:48.052
But it looks terrible here.

09:48.053 --> 09:50.353
Let's try it by the trash can!

09:50.388 --> 09:51.889
You can't leave, Louise.

09:51.890 --> 09:53.556
It's just a bitter pill
you have to swallow.

09:53.591 --> 09:55.359
(groans)
But it's not a real pill.

09:55.360 --> 09:57.094
'Cause that would be medicine
and I can't dispense...

09:57.095 --> 09:58.362
I know, Tina!

09:58.363 --> 09:59.863
You're drunk with lack of power.

09:59.864 --> 10:01.230
There's one selfie

10:01.266 --> 10:03.099
on Tammy's phone
I can't identify.

10:03.134 --> 10:05.101
You can see just a little bit
of hair and sweater.

10:05.136 --> 10:07.404
Whoever it is could be
walking around with lice

10:07.405 --> 10:08.906
and not even know it.

10:08.907 --> 10:11.174
Like I'll never truly know
how cute my butt is.

10:11.209 --> 10:12.476
Good news, everyone.

10:12.477 --> 10:14.778
I've found a cure for superlice.

10:14.779 --> 10:16.512
Finally!
That's great.

10:16.548 --> 10:17.714
I'm not a hero, Tina.

10:17.715 --> 10:19.549
I'm just doing my job.

10:19.584 --> 10:21.552
I didn't call you a hero.
Oh, I thought you did.

10:21.553 --> 10:22.786
I get to go first.
(groans)

10:22.787 --> 10:23.954
And I want a reward
for being brave,

10:23.955 --> 10:25.588
like a smoothie or a Prius.

10:25.623 --> 10:28.925
So it's quick, all natural,
but pretty cutting edge.

10:28.960 --> 10:31.161
Bring on this wonder drug!
It's probably hemp.

10:31.162 --> 10:33.430
Yeah, is it a pill
or a shampoo I use at home

10:33.431 --> 10:34.430
or just give it to...

10:34.432 --> 10:35.698
I'm shaving heads!

10:35.733 --> 10:37.133
(gasping) What?!

10:37.168 --> 10:38.435
Oh, and burning hats.

10:38.436 --> 10:39.969
No!
No!

10:41.736 --> 10:44.837
No! My hair <i> and</i> my ears?

10:44.838 --> 10:47.239
Why does everything bad
happen to me?

10:47.240 --> 10:49.408
It's happening
to us, too, Tammy!

10:49.409 --> 10:51.077
Well, not really,
'cause you're not blonde.

10:51.078 --> 10:53.012
Neither are you.
You shut up right now!

10:53.013 --> 10:55.281
You better shut that down.
Shut it up.

10:55.282 --> 10:57.783
Um, Nurse Liz, this sounds like
pretty aggressive treatment.

10:57.784 --> 11:00.786
Yeah! And, Tina,
you get to hold the kids down.

11:00.787 --> 11:02.555
Uh...

11:02.556 --> 11:04.056
Anyone comes after me,
they're gonna get

11:04.057 --> 11:06.191
an eyeful
of cherry throat spray.

11:06.226 --> 11:07.760
Do us! Do us!
Do us! Do us!

11:07.761 --> 11:09.528
I heard children screaming
from down the hall.

11:09.529 --> 11:10.930
As a counselor, I've learned

11:10.931 --> 11:13.331
that screams can actually be
a cry for help.

11:13.367 --> 11:14.767
She wants to shave our heads.

11:14.768 --> 11:16.668
And I don't even know
how much to tip!

11:16.703 --> 11:18.437
Well, then that's
what's gonna happen.

11:18.438 --> 11:20.719
Mr. Frond, your hair and sweater
match the mystery selfie.

11:20.741 --> 11:24.075
Oh. Well, I might have leaned in
for a selfie.

11:24.111 --> 11:26.545
I'm on top of trends.
(chuckles) Oh, I...

11:26.546 --> 11:28.614
I'm-I'm sure I didn't get lice.

11:28.615 --> 11:29.915
Hold him, Tina.

11:29.916 --> 11:31.584
No. (stammers) Please.

11:31.585 --> 11:32.885
I-I have a date.

11:32.886 --> 11:34.119
I have to match my picture!

11:34.154 --> 11:36.255
It's already not very close!

11:36.256 --> 11:38.289
A date with someone
besides my Aunt Gayle?

11:38.325 --> 11:40.559
Maybe.
(growling)

11:40.560 --> 11:41.961
Tina, you're hurting me.

11:41.962 --> 11:43.396
(screams)

11:43.397 --> 11:44.696
Darn it, jammed.

11:44.731 --> 11:46.732
Before too much of
my hair came off?

11:46.733 --> 11:47.967
Oh. Here we go!

11:47.968 --> 11:49.668
(screams)

11:49.669 --> 11:52.071
Crap! Treatment is postponed
while I get these fixed.

11:52.072 --> 11:53.605
(whimpering)

11:53.640 --> 11:56.108
Hey, just change the side
your part is on and...

11:56.109 --> 11:57.409
and nobody will even notice.

11:59.279 --> 12:00.346
(stool farting)

12:00.347 --> 12:01.447
I'm fading here, Bob.

12:01.448 --> 12:02.848
I lost my mechanics.

12:02.849 --> 12:04.350
I'm all up in my head!

12:04.351 --> 12:06.018
Yeah, I gotta take a break, too.

12:06.019 --> 12:07.186
My kegels are givin' out.

12:07.187 --> 12:08.454
We gotta keep going!

12:08.455 --> 12:09.922
Very sad people
will be here in an hour.

12:09.923 --> 12:11.456
(bell dings)

12:11.491 --> 12:13.292
Oh, trying to get the farts
out of stools, huh?

12:13.293 --> 12:15.226
Yes.
You have experience with this?

12:15.262 --> 12:16.595
Yeah. I had a vinyl seat

12:16.596 --> 12:18.097
in my mail truck
with the same problem.

12:18.098 --> 12:19.331
Children laughed at me.

12:19.332 --> 12:20.832
Before that,
I was the cool mailman.

12:20.867 --> 12:23.002
Mike's right!
We can't do this alone.

12:23.003 --> 12:24.602
We gotta accept help
from friends.

12:24.638 --> 12:26.604
I don't think I offered to help.

12:26.640 --> 12:28.307
When the Amish wanted
to build a barn,

12:28.308 --> 12:29.708
did they do it themselves?

12:29.709 --> 12:32.211
No, Kelly McGillis
took a sexy sponge bath

12:32.212 --> 12:33.946
and she got Harrison Ford
to pitch in.

12:33.947 --> 12:35.814
The Amish really
know how to bathe.

12:35.849 --> 12:37.483
But there's no time.
How do we get the word out?

12:37.484 --> 12:39.318
Did someone say "free beer"?

12:39.319 --> 12:41.753
Where? Where's free beer? Ohh...

12:41.788 --> 12:43.489
Yes! I'll make a sign!

12:43.490 --> 12:44.890
After a couple of beers,

12:44.891 --> 12:46.291
this stuff pretty
much delivers itself.

12:46.326 --> 12:48.327
Farty party!
(stool farts)

12:48.328 --> 12:50.595
LOUISE: <i>We gotta get outta here.</i>

12:50.630 --> 12:53.399
Maybe someone's already dug
a tunnel behind that cat poster.

12:53.400 --> 12:55.067
We'll just peel it back
and, uh...

12:55.068 --> 12:57.036
Okay, no tunnel.

12:57.037 --> 12:58.304
Well, we'll dig one ourselves

12:58.305 --> 12:59.538
with these Popsicle sticks!

12:59.539 --> 13:01.005
Ah, it broke.

13:01.041 --> 13:03.175
Aw, man, people are gonna
call me cue ball!

13:03.176 --> 13:04.844
I wanted my nickname
to be eight ball.

13:04.845 --> 13:07.146
I haven't been bald
since I was a baby.

13:07.147 --> 13:08.747
I cried all the time!

13:08.748 --> 13:11.049
Ugh, and my dad just built me
a scrunchie closet.

13:12.085 --> 13:13.085
So... I'm picking up

13:13.086 --> 13:14.486
some negative feedback

13:14.521 --> 13:16.088
about shaving
everyone's hair off.

13:16.089 --> 13:17.590
Maybe we send kids home,

13:17.591 --> 13:18.990
kick this can
down the road a little bit?

13:19.025 --> 13:21.760
No! I'm saving heads
by shaving heads!

13:21.761 --> 13:24.195
I'll be the school nurse
that beat super lice.

13:24.231 --> 13:26.198
And when I go to
my nursing school reunion,

13:26.199 --> 13:27.600
I won't even need a name tag,

13:27.601 --> 13:29.034
though I'll probably
wear it anyway

13:29.035 --> 13:30.436
if they have one for me,
'cause why not?

13:30.437 --> 13:31.904
I don't want to be
weird about it!

13:31.905 --> 13:33.739
But...
It's happening, Tina!

13:33.740 --> 13:36.208
I'm not gonna be the only freak
around here with a shaved head.

13:36.209 --> 13:38.409
(clippers buzzing)
Hey, I fixed them!

13:38.445 --> 13:40.712
♪ ♪

13:40.747 --> 13:42.047
(stools farting)
Bob, it's working!

13:42.048 --> 13:43.549
I think the farts
are going down!

13:43.550 --> 13:44.749
We just might make it, Lin.

13:44.784 --> 13:46.385
Marshmallow is here.

13:46.386 --> 13:47.752
And she brought her rear.

13:47.787 --> 13:48.888
Oh, hey, Marshmallow.

13:48.889 --> 13:50.890
Hey, baby. Ooh!

13:50.891 --> 13:53.058
Okay, where to start?

13:53.059 --> 13:54.492
With Louise.
(gasps)

13:54.528 --> 13:56.361
(whimpering)

13:57.531 --> 13:58.531
Oops!

13:58.532 --> 14:00.399
Oh, you've stopped me!

14:00.400 --> 14:02.701
I'm just gonna go right here
and plug it right into the wall...

14:02.702 --> 14:04.770
Ah!
Ha!

14:04.771 --> 14:06.337
Now you're exposed!

14:06.373 --> 14:08.007
So let's talk again

14:08.008 --> 14:09.408
about who's getting
shaved and who's g...

14:09.409 --> 14:10.642
(clippers buzzing)

14:10.677 --> 14:12.011
Ahh...

14:12.012 --> 14:13.245
Oh...

14:13.246 --> 14:14.947
And...

14:14.948 --> 14:16.548
better.

14:16.583 --> 14:18.551
Eyebrows.
That's commitment.

14:18.552 --> 14:20.019
Uh, Nurse Liz,

14:20.020 --> 14:21.520
you look like someone
who should be lying down.

14:21.521 --> 14:23.022
Under observation.

14:23.023 --> 14:25.557
She also looks a little
like Michael Chiklis.

14:25.592 --> 14:27.525
Come here, Louise.

14:27.561 --> 14:30.461
Uh, Nurse Liz, you're on a roll!

14:30.497 --> 14:32.063
Ah, oh!

14:32.098 --> 14:33.965
Move the table!

14:34.000 --> 14:35.801
Everybody run!

14:35.802 --> 14:38.137
I'm not really feeling up
to running... okay!

14:38.138 --> 14:40.583
Stop those louse-y kids!

14:43.100 --> 14:45.333
(panting)

14:45.369 --> 14:46.736
So you finally
saw the light, huh?

14:46.737 --> 14:48.504
'Bout time!

14:48.505 --> 14:50.373
Yeah, I didn't notice it
till she was bald and sweaty,

14:50.374 --> 14:52.140
but Nurse Liz is kind of insane.

14:52.175 --> 14:53.341
Which way do we go?

14:53.377 --> 14:55.310
I can't handle
choices right now!

14:55.345 --> 14:57.079
We'll have a better
chance if we split up.

14:57.080 --> 14:58.413
Half go left, half go right!

14:58.448 --> 15:00.148
Go!
Yeah...

15:00.183 --> 15:02.184
Wh... Oh. We're the only
ones who chose right?

15:02.185 --> 15:03.419
We went right?

15:03.420 --> 15:05.019
I thought this was...
Never mind.

15:05.055 --> 15:06.622
You go after those two!

15:06.623 --> 15:08.758
Ow! You don't have to push me,
I'm on your side!

15:08.759 --> 15:10.492
God!
Go!

15:10.527 --> 15:13.495
Follow me! I know this school
like the back of my hand!

15:13.530 --> 15:14.930
Yeah, this is where
the dead end is.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.565
Good. Good. Good.

15:16.566 --> 15:18.032
LIZ: All right, let's go...
(gasping)

15:18.068 --> 15:19.434
nice and easy... no, wait!

15:19.469 --> 15:20.769
<i>Lice</i> and easy.

15:20.804 --> 15:22.204
Good one.

15:22.205 --> 15:24.239
It's just interesting
to see her process.

15:24.274 --> 15:26.341
How long do we have to run?

15:26.376 --> 15:27.743
I'd just like to say
you're the last person

15:27.744 --> 15:29.010
I wanted to be escaping with.

15:29.045 --> 15:30.279
Okay, well,
I would just like to say

15:30.280 --> 15:31.547
that I am not escaping with you,

15:31.548 --> 15:33.014
we are escaping
separately together!

15:33.049 --> 15:35.217
Well, let's just run
and not talk, okay?

15:35.218 --> 15:36.452
Fine, stopping now!
(growls)

15:36.453 --> 15:37.685
You, down there!

15:37.721 --> 15:39.888
Stop them!
No way, man!

15:39.923 --> 15:41.289
They're gonna lice us!

15:41.324 --> 15:42.658
The library!

15:42.659 --> 15:43.926
In here!

15:43.927 --> 15:45.728
The library?
Ew. Ew.

15:45.729 --> 15:47.128
Oh, my God!

15:47.164 --> 15:49.130
(panting quietly)

15:52.169 --> 15:54.302
(awkward chuckling)

15:55.839 --> 15:57.306
LOUISE: We can make it out
through that window.

15:57.307 --> 15:58.774
Then we're safe.

15:58.775 --> 16:00.442
But Mr. Ambrose can see
the window from his desk.

16:00.477 --> 16:01.744
All right, let's just
hunker down here

16:01.745 --> 16:03.012
and wait for him to get up.

16:03.013 --> 16:04.513
It won't take long,
he hates his job.

16:04.514 --> 16:05.747
What's this?

16:05.782 --> 16:08.150
"Medical Encyclopedia."

16:08.151 --> 16:09.418
Oh, God, don't open it...

16:09.419 --> 16:11.020
you'll get book smell
everywhere.

16:11.021 --> 16:12.420
Thank you. Thanks, everybody.

16:12.456 --> 16:13.956
Thanks for helping.

16:13.957 --> 16:15.858
Mm, man, my cushion
did some pushin'.

16:15.859 --> 16:17.693
All right, the funeral people
will be here any second.

16:17.694 --> 16:19.462
But I... I think we're ready.

16:19.463 --> 16:22.263
Ah, I'm still a little worried
about that third stool there.

16:22.299 --> 16:23.799
It was the gassiest one.

16:23.800 --> 16:24.999
What, really?
Oh, God, they're here.

16:25.035 --> 16:27.101
(mourners murmuring)

16:27.137 --> 16:28.370
Welcome, welcome.

16:28.371 --> 16:29.638
Sit... sit anywhere.

16:29.639 --> 16:30.973
The booths are nice.

16:30.974 --> 16:32.407
I've always been
a booth man myself.

16:32.442 --> 16:34.710
They call me the booth fairy.

16:34.711 --> 16:35.978
Uh, sorry.

16:35.979 --> 16:38.279
The counter looks nice.
Mm-hmm.

16:38.315 --> 16:39.447
(quietly):
Oh, God, the third stool!

16:39.483 --> 16:41.150
Oh, are you the widow?

16:41.151 --> 16:43.018
Uh, yeah, we have
a VIP booth for you.

16:43.019 --> 16:44.252
For-for widows.
Oh. Ow.

16:44.287 --> 16:45.488
Stop shoving!

16:45.489 --> 16:46.689
No, no, I'm not, I'm helping!

16:46.690 --> 16:47.690
Ow!
I'm helping!

16:47.691 --> 16:49.058
Lin.
Okay.

16:49.059 --> 16:50.658
Sit anywhere.
Wherever you want.

16:51.695 --> 16:53.094
(loud fart) Oh, my.

16:53.129 --> 16:55.164
- (quietly): Damn it!
- Sorry, Bob.

16:55.165 --> 16:56.698
Ooh, unless...

16:56.733 --> 16:59.001
Hmm. Could be.
I-I can't tell.

16:59.002 --> 17:00.569
Teddy, can you get in there?

17:00.570 --> 17:02.371
Was it the seat or was it her?

17:02.372 --> 17:03.771
I'm checking it out
right now, Bob.

17:03.807 --> 17:05.307
(sniffs)

17:05.308 --> 17:06.541
It's real.

17:06.542 --> 17:07.977
It's a real one, all right!

17:07.978 --> 17:09.344
Oh, wow, it's a real one!

17:09.378 --> 17:11.213
Yeah, oh, now I'm getting it.

17:11.214 --> 17:12.446
It's definitely her!

17:12.482 --> 17:13.715
LINDA: All right!

17:13.717 --> 17:15.849
Roger would have
loved this place.

17:15.886 --> 17:17.117
♪ ♪

17:17.153 --> 17:19.088
Huh.

17:19.089 --> 17:20.320
Oh, my God.

17:20.357 --> 17:21.589
Ring.

17:21.590 --> 17:23.526
Oh hello, a librarian emergency?

17:23.527 --> 17:24.791
I'll be right there!

17:24.828 --> 17:26.493
Now's our chance!

17:26.530 --> 17:28.196
LIZ (over P.A. system):
Lice alert.

17:28.198 --> 17:29.831
We have re-quarantined
most of the infected students.

17:29.866 --> 17:31.267
Oh, no.

17:31.268 --> 17:33.334
Louise Belcher and Tammy Larson
remain at large.

17:33.370 --> 17:35.404
If you have any contact
with them, turn them in.

17:35.405 --> 17:37.338
And then turn yourself in
because you have lice.

17:37.374 --> 17:38.574
She got the others.

17:38.575 --> 17:39.641
Sucks for them.

17:39.676 --> 17:41.343
Okay, let's go!
Wait.

17:41.344 --> 17:42.578
(sighs)

17:42.579 --> 17:44.179
We gotta go back.
What?! No!

17:44.180 --> 17:45.581
I know, I know.

17:45.582 --> 17:46.882
But I have a gross feeling

17:46.883 --> 17:48.250
that we should help the others.

17:48.251 --> 17:50.219
And I have an idea
and I need you.

17:50.220 --> 17:51.553
Which is also gross.

17:51.588 --> 17:53.289
Here's the thing:
I hate helping.

17:53.290 --> 17:54.690
I'm out the window!
Wait, wait, wait!

17:54.691 --> 17:57.025
(grunting) Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.

17:58.562 --> 18:00.863
Guys, we're in
the nurse's office

18:00.864 --> 18:03.599
where Nurse Liz is gonna shave
kids' heads while we watch.

18:03.600 --> 18:05.768
This microphone's heavy,
I'm gonna put it down.

18:05.769 --> 18:07.001
No, don't do that?
Okay.

18:07.037 --> 18:08.703
Hold it, Nurse Wacky!

18:08.738 --> 18:11.372
Oh, look what
the lice dragged in.

18:11.408 --> 18:13.042
Really not liking this plan.

18:13.043 --> 18:14.242
I have information.

18:14.277 --> 18:16.278
Tammy is Patient Zero.

18:16.279 --> 18:18.113
But she doesn't have lice...

18:18.114 --> 18:20.382
she has dandruff!

18:20.383 --> 18:21.583
Look at it!

18:21.618 --> 18:23.719
Look at the glorious dandruff!

18:23.720 --> 18:25.386
It's snowing!

18:25.422 --> 18:26.755
Old people have dandruff.

18:26.756 --> 18:27.956
I'd rather have lice.

18:27.991 --> 18:29.425
But why are we all scratching?

18:29.426 --> 18:30.959
Dandruff's not contagious.

18:30.994 --> 18:32.294
It's psychosomatic.

18:32.295 --> 18:34.063
The power of suggestion.

18:34.064 --> 18:36.231
Just say the word "lice"
and everyone itches their heads.

18:36.232 --> 18:38.566
Oh, my God!
Stop it, Louise!

18:38.602 --> 18:41.703
Nurse Liz, please read
from this medical encyclopedia

18:41.738 --> 18:44.772
the marked passage...
how dandruff is often

18:44.808 --> 18:46.040
misdiagnosed as lice.

18:46.076 --> 18:48.143
Like how my asthma
was misdiagnosed

18:48.144 --> 18:49.744
as having a bad attitude.

18:49.779 --> 18:51.580
Uh, I don't need to read it

18:51.581 --> 18:53.616
because obviously,
Tammy has dandruff and lice.

18:53.617 --> 18:55.818
Dandruff and lice?

18:55.819 --> 18:57.652
Mm-hmm.
She's a mess.

18:57.687 --> 18:59.755
Oh, my God. That's not good.

18:59.756 --> 19:00.955
Yeah. You can have both.

19:00.991 --> 19:02.358
Oh... Sorry.

19:02.359 --> 19:03.626
Darn it, Louise!

19:03.627 --> 19:05.127
I was out the window!

19:05.128 --> 19:06.795
Where were we?

19:06.796 --> 19:09.031
(gasps)
No, Nurse Liz, read the book!

19:09.032 --> 19:11.132
It's over, Tina.
Read the book!

19:11.167 --> 19:13.836
God, I could read it,
but reading?

19:13.837 --> 19:15.069
Ugh!

19:15.105 --> 19:16.839
Right, kids? Right?

19:16.840 --> 19:18.172
Yeah!
She gets it.

19:18.208 --> 19:19.642
You can't read it.

19:19.643 --> 19:21.142
Because you don't
have your glasses.

19:21.177 --> 19:22.645
What's... what are you
trying to say?

19:22.646 --> 19:23.911
(laughing): I don't even...

19:23.947 --> 19:25.747
I noticed you squinting,
then I noticed

19:25.782 --> 19:27.216
the little marks on your nose.

19:27.217 --> 19:28.951
I have them, too.
(gasps)

19:28.952 --> 19:31.452
I always thought Tina wore
fake glasses to hide those.

19:31.488 --> 19:34.523
Uh... wh... I... I left
them at home, okay?

19:34.524 --> 19:36.492
I got in the car and I thought
it was gonna be that thing

19:36.493 --> 19:38.027
where I say
"where are my glasses?"

19:38.028 --> 19:39.294
and then it turns out
they're on my head.

19:39.295 --> 19:40.529
But they weren't!

19:40.530 --> 19:41.997
They're not, right?
No.

19:41.998 --> 19:43.232
And that's why you couldn't have

19:43.233 --> 19:44.465
seen lice on Tammy's head.

19:44.501 --> 19:46.701
(all gasp) Nice one, T.

19:46.736 --> 19:48.170
All right, yes.

19:48.171 --> 19:50.172
Maybe I saw
what I wanted to see.

19:50.173 --> 19:51.674
Is that such a crime?

19:51.675 --> 19:54.175
You really want a nurse
with no imagination?

19:54.210 --> 19:55.710
- Kind of?
- Yes. Preferably.

19:55.745 --> 19:58.647
Oh, screw it, I'll just
skip the reunion.

19:58.648 --> 20:00.815
I don't want to show up
there with a bald head.

20:00.850 --> 20:02.551
Again.
I get it.

20:02.552 --> 20:03.819
You had a zeal to heal.

20:03.820 --> 20:05.354
But you forgot to keep it real.

20:05.355 --> 20:07.690
Oh, can you sign this form
so I get my nursing patch?

20:07.691 --> 20:09.191
That's not the right place.

20:09.192 --> 20:10.426
Oh, you can't see.

20:10.427 --> 20:11.694
That's my hand.

20:11.695 --> 20:14.229
So, Tammy, what's next for you?

20:14.230 --> 20:16.031
I do the interviews, Jocelyn!

20:16.032 --> 20:17.266
What's next for <i> you?</i>

20:17.267 --> 20:19.501
No, I have the microphone.

20:19.502 --> 20:21.503
- So, like, what's next for you?
- No, what's next for you, Jocelyn,

20:21.504 --> 20:23.505
- in your journey to give me the microphone?
- No...

20:23.506 --> 20:25.507
- I think it's my microphone.
- No, Jocelyn, I'm not kidding.

20:25.508 --> 20:27.176
- I'm doing the news right now.
- Give it back. Give it back!

20:27.177 --> 20:28.677
- Just get off it right now!
- Give it! Give it to me!

20:28.678 --> 20:29.912
Get off it! Ow!
Ha-ha, got it!

20:29.913 --> 20:31.513
So gross.
You're gross.

20:31.514 --> 20:32.748
You're my best friend.
You're my best friend.

20:32.749 --> 20:33.981
I love you.

20:34.017 --> 20:35.584
There you are, Louise.

20:35.585 --> 20:37.786
There's still time
to take your pop quiz.

20:37.787 --> 20:39.054
Pop quiz?

20:39.055 --> 20:40.522
Ah, all right...

20:40.523 --> 20:42.191
Wh... whoa!

20:42.192 --> 20:44.425
My leg! Oh!

20:44.461 --> 20:46.028
Oh, Louise, your leg!

20:46.029 --> 20:47.629
Tina!
It's all twisted!

20:47.630 --> 20:49.965
It's, like, totally
facing the wrong way.

20:49.966 --> 20:51.400
We need to get
this girl some ice!

20:51.401 --> 20:53.302
You gotta be kidding me.

20:53.303 --> 20:56.438
Don't just stand there,
LaBonz, get the damn ice!
