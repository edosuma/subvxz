So,

00:02.369 --> 00:04.404
today is our first day
on the job

00:04.438 --> 00:07.374
as leaders of
the Vampiric Council.

00:07.407 --> 00:11.712
Nadja and I have agreed
to work together as a team.

00:14.448 --> 00:17.017
NADJA:
For now, I am letting
Nandor think that we are

00:17.050 --> 00:19.152
"sharing power."

00:19.186 --> 00:21.788
But there can only be one
Supreme Leader,

00:21.822 --> 00:24.024
and I will do whatever it takes.

00:24.057 --> 00:26.059
That is how you are
the only one that survives

00:26.093 --> 00:27.461
out of 17 children.

00:27.494 --> 00:28.629
NANDOR:
I admire

00:28.662 --> 00:30.497
Nadja's decisiveness

00:30.531 --> 00:32.499
and how loud she is.

00:32.533 --> 00:35.435
But I am
the more experienced leader.

00:35.469 --> 00:38.672
Eventually,
I will make her my number two.

00:38.705 --> 00:40.774
So you're saying you...

00:40.807 --> 00:42.442
you need to make a number two?

00:42.476 --> 00:45.412
Indeed.
Not right now but soon.

00:45.445 --> 00:47.381
It's not something
you should force.

00:47.414 --> 00:49.349
(snickers)
But you're saying it's important

00:49.383 --> 00:52.319
to have a really good
number two.

00:52.352 --> 00:54.021
‐Yes.
‐(snickering)

00:54.054 --> 00:56.123
There's nothing funny about
a firm number two.

00:56.156 --> 00:58.692
(chuckles)
What was the plan again?

00:58.725 --> 01:02.396
The plan is that I‐‐
Nandor The Relentless‐‐

01:02.429 --> 01:06.266
will sit on my throne
and make a number two.

pull this woman called Meg,

09:22.020 --> 09:23.155
and then come back.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.490
I'd go myself, but...

09:25.524 --> 09:27.125
I can't be fucked.

09:33.498 --> 09:35.333
I've often fancied myself

09:35.367 --> 09:37.469
quite the seducer, obviously.

09:37.502 --> 09:39.438
There's a technique
called "negging"

09:39.471 --> 09:41.206
that I'm eager to try.

09:41.239 --> 09:43.442
I'd explain it to you,
but you're probably too naive

09:43.475 --> 09:45.277
to understand it.

09:47.546 --> 09:49.181
How do I look?

09:49.214 --> 09:51.383
Never mind, your opinion
doesn't matter.

09:51.416 --> 09:54.252
And now you're horny because
you just got negged again.

09:57.356 --> 09:59.057
I can't see dick.

10:00.058 --> 10:01.960
That's better.
Watch and learn.

10:01.993 --> 10:04.563
‐(entry bell rings)
‐Oh, hey, Nandor.

10:04.596 --> 10:06.164
I haven't seen you in a while.

10:06.198 --> 10:07.366
Hey, dipshit.

10:07.399 --> 10:08.934
Excuse me?

10:08.967 --> 10:11.436
Uh, there used to be a hot chick
who worked here.

10:11.470 --> 10:13.038
Meg, I think?

10:13.071 --> 10:14.172
I'm Meg.

10:14.206 --> 10:16.942
You were hotter.

10:16.975 --> 10:18.310
What the fuck is your problem?

10:18.343 --> 10:20.645
Okay, calm down, toots.

10:20.679 --> 10:22.581
So sensitive.

10:22.614 --> 10:24.449
Let me cut to the chizzle:

10:24.483 --> 10:27.185
Life didn't turn out
the way you planned.

10:27.219 --> 10:30.288
You're a fading beauty
working nights at the gym.

10:30.322 --> 10:34.159
You've probably had
a string of boyfriends

10:34.192 --> 10:36.595
who promised you the world,
and then delivered it

10:36.628 --> 10:37.963
on a four‐inch penis.

10:37.996 --> 10:39.331
Well, here's your chance.

10:39.364 --> 10:41.566
You can leave with me right now,

10:41.600 --> 10:45.437
or watch these hot buns walk
out the door forever.

10:45.470 --> 10:47.439
Hang on.
Let me just get my stuff.

10:47.472 --> 10:48.573
Okay, you do that.

10:51.009 --> 10:52.177
Just wait right here.

10:52.210 --> 10:53.445
These buns will be waiting
for you.

10:53.478 --> 10:56.048
‐Great.
‐Did you see that?

10:56.081 --> 10:57.482
My brain in this package,

10:57.516 --> 11:00.018
that poor kid never stood
a chance.

11:00.052 --> 11:02.487
‐Hey, buddy.
We got a problem here?
‐Hello.

11:02.521 --> 11:04.589
‐Hey. No problem, buddy.
‐Get these fucking cameras
out of my face.

11:04.623 --> 11:06.892
‐Let's go. Get out, man.
‐You should, uh,
we‐we should skedaddle.

11:06.925 --> 11:08.226
‐Fuck off.
‐Let's skedaddle here.

11:08.260 --> 11:10.395
‐(doors rattling)
‐Shit.

11:11.363 --> 11:13.098
Didn't see that coming.

11:13.131 --> 11:16.334
‐Ooh!
‐Well, that was
a complete waste of time.

11:16.368 --> 11:18.437
‐She's clearly not into guys.
‐Really?

11:18.470 --> 11:19.938
‐Yeah.
‐Should I give it a go?

11:19.971 --> 11:21.206
You can try.

11:21.239 --> 11:22.908
I mean, she's not into studs,

11:22.941 --> 11:24.176
so maybe you'll have
better luck. (soft chuckle)

11:24.209 --> 11:25.510
(Laszlo fake chuckles)

11:25.544 --> 11:26.511
NADJA (over P. A.):
Colin Robinson,

11:26.545 --> 11:28.246
we are going to Queens.

11:28.280 --> 11:29.981
A rogue vampire group
hasn't paid their dues,

11:30.015 --> 11:31.483
and we need you to take notes.

11:31.516 --> 11:33.418
NANDOR:
I wanted to say it!

11:33.452 --> 11:36.288
We are visiting
a rogue vampire cell in Queens.

11:36.321 --> 11:38.457
They will taste our wrath
and quickly submit.

11:38.490 --> 11:41.426
I am prepared to escalate
matters to crazy levels.

11:41.460 --> 11:44.029
It's more of a courtesy call.

11:44.062 --> 11:45.163
I get to knock.

11:45.197 --> 11:46.565
WES:
Yo.

11:46.598 --> 11:48.233
Finally, virgins...

11:48.266 --> 11:50.936
‐Wes Blankenship?
‐Yes.

11:50.969 --> 11:52.971
‐Greetings, I am Nandor.
‐You have ignored all attempts
at communication.

11:53.004 --> 11:54.439
‐This is Nadja,
‐Bend the knee or I will

11:54.473 --> 11:55.907
‐and he is Colin Robinson.
‐unleash Colin Robinson.

11:55.941 --> 11:57.309
Wassup?

11:57.342 --> 11:59.611
NANDOR:
We are your new Vampiric
Council.

11:59.644 --> 12:01.313
We have not heard from you
in a while,

12:01.346 --> 12:04.316
so we thought we'd pop by
and see if all is well.

12:04.349 --> 12:06.551
All right, just come on in.
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!

12:06.585 --> 12:07.619
I always wanted to do this:

12:07.652 --> 12:09.154
My name is Wes Blankenship

12:09.187 --> 12:10.889
and welcome to my crib!

12:10.922 --> 12:12.224
Let's go, baby!

12:12.257 --> 12:14.626
Hope you don't mind
if I take notes in here.

12:14.659 --> 12:16.395
(squeaking)

12:18.330 --> 12:20.399
(entry bell rings)

12:23.235 --> 12:25.203
No, no.
You are not allowed here.

12:25.237 --> 12:28.373
She's angry,
as women so often are.

12:28.407 --> 12:30.108
Please, good lady.

12:30.142 --> 12:32.577
I know I came here earlier,
but whatever I said‐‐

12:32.611 --> 12:35.914
and I don't remember‐‐
I wasn't myself.

12:35.947 --> 12:38.150
Well, you started
by calling me dipshit, so...

12:38.183 --> 12:40.285
Proof of naught
but mine own delirium.

12:40.318 --> 12:43.188
You, my darling,
have the high, firm ass

12:43.221 --> 12:45.590
‐of an Irish Derby winner.
‐Okay, um...

12:45.624 --> 12:49.161
Okay, I've gone a little bit
too fast too soon,

12:49.194 --> 12:50.295
but hear me out.

12:50.328 --> 12:53.065
Truth is,
I came here to pitch woo

12:53.098 --> 12:54.499
but was so nervous,

12:54.533 --> 12:57.369
I took a calming physic
to settle my nerves.

12:57.402 --> 13:00.472
That drug turned me into
a fucking monster.

13:00.505 --> 13:02.474
Shit, was it Klonopin?

13:02.507 --> 13:04.176
Indeed. That one.

13:04.209 --> 13:06.311
Yeah, you know,
I can't take it anymore myself.

13:06.344 --> 13:09.247
Oh. We are very much alike,
then.

13:09.281 --> 13:11.116
Could I sing you something?

13:11.149 --> 13:13.318
(sighs):
Oh, God, uh, I‐I guess.

13:16.054 --> 13:18.290
♪ I see your picture ♪

13:18.323 --> 13:20.592
♪ Name in lights above it ♪

13:22.060 --> 13:24.563
♪ This is your big debut ♪

13:24.596 --> 13:27.332
♪ A dream come true ♪

13:27.366 --> 13:30.035
♪ And when you smile
for the camera ♪

13:30.068 --> 13:32.371
♪ I know
they're going to love it. ♪

13:32.404 --> 13:34.573
‐Meg.
‐Uh... Wow.

13:34.606 --> 13:36.908
That's very embarrassing.

13:36.942 --> 13:38.610
‐You know,
I'm‐I'm at work, so...
‐Say no more.

13:38.643 --> 13:40.479
May I show you something?

13:40.512 --> 13:42.447
I feel like
you're going to anyway.

13:42.481 --> 13:45.617
Some of the most licentious
and transgressive pornography

13:45.650 --> 13:47.886
I've ever clapped eyes on.

13:47.919 --> 13:50.188
‐Chris!
‐Fuck.

13:50.222 --> 13:51.556
You will remember nothing.

13:51.590 --> 13:53.492
Unhand me, you bloody peasant.

13:53.525 --> 13:56.428
How does Nandor get
this fucking ape body to work?

13:56.461 --> 13:58.897
(groans) Okay.

13:58.930 --> 14:00.632
You're officially banned,
you pervert.

14:00.665 --> 14:02.367
Just fuck off.

14:02.401 --> 14:04.436
You fuck off, you bald prick.

14:04.469 --> 14:06.304
Fucking swear at me.

14:06.338 --> 14:09.474
So, look, the reason why you
guys haven't heard from us is

14:09.508 --> 14:11.176
because, well, this clan,

14:11.209 --> 14:13.345
we rejects the authority
of the Vampiric Council.

14:13.378 --> 14:16.381
‐(hissing)
‐Uh, hey, slow down there, puck.

14:16.415 --> 14:20.452
I have you at,
"Welcome to my crib..."

14:20.485 --> 14:22.621
So, we've set up
our own governing body.

14:22.654 --> 14:25.023
‐(gasps)
‐Yeah. We're called
The Council Of Vampires.

14:25.057 --> 14:26.358
Maybe you guys would
like to join us.

14:26.391 --> 14:29.361
There is only
one Vampiric Council,

14:29.394 --> 14:32.964
and you will either bend the
knee or face the consequences.

14:32.998 --> 14:35.434
‐(hissing)
‐(chuckles): Yes, that's...

14:35.467 --> 14:37.035
Typical hierarchical
mindset cope.

14:37.069 --> 14:38.470
‐Don't you point at me!
‐Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

14:38.503 --> 14:41.907
Wes, you seem like
a very reasonable vampire.

14:41.940 --> 14:44.042
‐We are also
reasonable vampires.
‐I'm not.

14:44.076 --> 14:45.944
‐Let's talk about this.
‐(phone rings)

14:45.977 --> 14:48.080
Uh, hold on. A‐Ash, can you,
can you get that please?

14:48.113 --> 14:50.182
Why do I have to do it?
I count one, two...

14:50.215 --> 14:51.650
‐Because I'm talking to
the old people. The elderly.
‐Yeah, okay.

14:51.683 --> 14:53.318
Do I have "secretary"
written on my forehead?

14:53.352 --> 14:54.953
WES: They're gonna forget
who they're talking to.

14:54.986 --> 14:56.054
‐Okay, but I'm not getting it.
‐All right, fine.

14:56.088 --> 14:57.322
I'll get it.

14:57.356 --> 14:59.224
You guys,
please excuse me for a sec.

14:59.257 --> 15:01.159
‐Should I write down
their bickering?
‐Write it all down.

15:01.193 --> 15:03.295
We're taking notes.
What are you doing?

15:03.328 --> 15:05.163
It is called diplomacy.

15:05.197 --> 15:06.431
Licking their assholes,
more like.

15:06.465 --> 15:08.367
Oh, shit.

15:08.400 --> 15:09.901
Mr. Robinson?

15:09.935 --> 15:11.937
Dave Lewis, energy vampire.

15:11.970 --> 15:13.505
I'm‐I'm a huge fan.

15:13.538 --> 15:15.941
Well, thank you, a fellow borer.

15:15.974 --> 15:17.909
‐Do you bore a lot?
‐All the time.

15:17.943 --> 15:19.978
(in Tony Montana accent):
Say hello to my little friend.

15:20.011 --> 15:22.047
‐(laughing)
‐NANDOR: Are you sure you have
the right Colin Robinson?

15:26.184 --> 15:27.419
(vent cover clatters)

15:30.055 --> 15:32.357
‐(screams)
‐(clattering)

15:32.391 --> 15:33.925
(grunts)

15:34.926 --> 15:36.028
Holy shit.

15:41.933 --> 15:44.169
Don't touch that book, Gizmo.

15:44.202 --> 15:45.904
It's too much
for your young cock.

15:45.937 --> 15:47.506
Sorry. I know I'm not supposed
to be in here.

15:47.539 --> 15:49.041
Just watch yourself.

15:49.074 --> 15:51.076
Otherwise,
it'll be suicide by porno.

15:51.109 --> 15:52.310
(chuckles)

15:52.344 --> 15:53.912
Is that
the Cloak of Duplication?

15:53.945 --> 15:55.180
I thought we weren't supposed
to touch that.

15:55.213 --> 15:56.114
‐Who gives a shit?
‐Well, can I...

15:56.148 --> 15:58.016
can I touch it?

15:59.484 --> 16:01.353
Actually, if you want
to do Nandor a favor,

16:01.386 --> 16:04.156
you could put that on,
head down to Massive Fitness

16:04.189 --> 16:06.191
and get a date
with a receptionist called Meg.

16:06.224 --> 16:09.361
I tried my luck,
but she's clearly not into guys.

16:09.394 --> 16:12.264
I hypnotized her, so you'll
start from a clean slate.

16:14.966 --> 16:17.102
(gasps):
Oh, wow. Wow.

16:17.135 --> 16:18.603
Laszlo, look.

16:18.637 --> 16:20.038
I look just like Nandor.

16:20.072 --> 16:22.074
Yeah, uncanny. Bugger off.

16:22.107 --> 16:23.475
(quietly):
Ah, this is awesome.

16:23.508 --> 16:24.910
I can fly.

16:24.943 --> 16:27.279
Bat! I‐I can't fly.

16:32.107 --> 16:34.386
So, what kind of drains

16:34.419 --> 16:35.854
‐are you pulling here?
‐Mostly weed‐related stuff.

16:35.887 --> 16:37.456
Indica v. sativa,
legalization rules,

16:37.489 --> 16:39.024
CBD, edibles, shatter...

16:39.057 --> 16:41.026
‐I could go on and I do.
‐Geez.

16:41.059 --> 16:42.427
Definitely keeping me
fat and happy.

16:42.461 --> 16:44.296
I'm also kind of
a sneakerhead

16:44.329 --> 16:45.897
and I just bought
a camera drone.

16:45.931 --> 16:48.567
‐People hate it.
‐I bet.

16:48.600 --> 16:51.303
Let me, uh, ask you a question,
Dave Lewis.

16:51.336 --> 16:54.139
Do you ever wonder
where we come from?

16:54.172 --> 16:55.907
You know, energy vampires?

16:55.941 --> 16:57.909
Boy,
it never even occurred to me.

16:57.943 --> 17:00.312
‐(Nadja shouting)
‐Uh, no idea, you know?

17:00.345 --> 17:02.280
Holy shit.

17:02.314 --> 17:04.216
Are you draining me, bro?

17:04.249 --> 17:06.151
‐No.
‐You're getting me, I think.

17:06.184 --> 17:07.886
‐No, I‐I wouldn't do that
to you.
‐(chuckles): Yeah.

17:07.919 --> 17:09.388
It seems like you guys are
listening,

17:09.421 --> 17:10.989
‐but you're not really hearing.
‐(Nadja groans)

17:11.023 --> 17:12.991
We are. We are listening
to everything, aren't we?

17:13.025 --> 17:15.927
We are not interested
in blindly supporting

17:15.961 --> 17:18.930
a self‐appointed soviet
given to arbitrary judgments

17:18.964 --> 17:20.932
based on mumbo jumbo
and interpretive dance.

17:20.966 --> 17:23.268
Wha‐‐ That's not exactly
how it works.

17:23.890 --> 17:26.493
We are definitely cutting back
on the ritualistic dancing.

17:26.526 --> 17:27.761
Ha! Like hell we are.

17:27.794 --> 17:29.496
‐Shh.
‐We can discuss this later.

17:29.529 --> 17:32.032
The Council provides
a lot of important services.

17:32.065 --> 17:35.035
‐Mm, like what?
‐Like how about it's none of
your fucking business!

17:35.068 --> 17:37.638
You guys really do not seem
qualified to be running shit.

17:37.671 --> 17:39.006
‐(hissing)
‐Wait, wait, wait, wait.

17:39.039 --> 17:41.475
"You guys don't seem qualified
to be running..."

17:41.508 --> 17:43.877
‐Don't write that down.
‐I'm sorry, what shit
are you qualified to run?

17:43.910 --> 17:45.912
I have a master's degree
in urban planning.

17:45.946 --> 17:48.482
‐Could I speak to you
in the kitchenette for a moment?
‐Yeah.

17:48.515 --> 17:49.850
Erase that last bit.

17:49.883 --> 17:51.985
I didn't know he had
a master's degree.

17:52.019 --> 17:53.120
What are we going to do?

17:53.153 --> 17:54.855
Eh.

17:54.888 --> 17:56.623
GUILLERMO:
Okay. (sighs)

17:56.657 --> 17:58.158
‐(slurping)
‐You know,

17:58.191 --> 17:59.926
I feel like you used
to come around all the time.

17:59.960 --> 18:01.928
‐How come I don't see you
anymore?
‐Oh, um...

18:01.962 --> 18:03.597
Work, mostly.

18:03.630 --> 18:06.166
It's been real busy
at the moment,

18:06.199 --> 18:08.468
and I feel kind of bad

18:08.502 --> 18:10.604
because, you know,
my‐my best friend,

18:10.637 --> 18:12.606
he actually got me
this gym membership,

18:12.639 --> 18:16.476
and I don't really use it, so...

18:16.510 --> 18:19.446
Uh, he's called Guillermo,
by the way.

18:19.479 --> 18:22.049
But, I mean, he's always doing
things like that for me,

18:22.082 --> 18:23.750
and I just kind of take it
for granted.

18:23.784 --> 18:25.152
(chuckles):
So, you know, that's what I do.

18:25.185 --> 18:27.154
Well, Nandor, that's terrible.

18:27.187 --> 18:29.923
He‐he's not gonna want
to stay friends with you.

18:29.957 --> 18:31.124
No, he will.

18:31.158 --> 18:33.193
But it's‐it's kind of awkward

18:33.226 --> 18:34.861
because we work together.

18:34.895 --> 18:37.064
But if you feel a certain way
about someone,

18:37.097 --> 18:39.800
and you've got something
weighing on your heart, then...

18:39.833 --> 18:41.068
(chuckles):
Okay.

18:41.101 --> 18:43.070
This guy must be really special.

18:43.103 --> 18:44.771
He is. Very.

18:44.805 --> 18:46.173
Let's talk about you.
How are you?

18:46.206 --> 18:49.643
No, I‐I think that
you should take him out

18:49.676 --> 18:51.612
one day after work
and tell him how you feel.

18:51.645 --> 18:53.580
It could be he has feelings
for you, too.

18:53.614 --> 18:56.116
Feelings, no, that's...

18:56.149 --> 18:59.052
We're just work friends,
so that's...

18:59.086 --> 19:00.887
Got to go.

19:00.921 --> 19:02.422
Sorry.

19:03.190 --> 19:06.026
He's being openly defiant.
He needs to go.

19:06.059 --> 19:07.761
‐(stammers)
‐You know I can hear you, right?

19:07.794 --> 19:10.030
‐Vampire hearing.
‐Yeah, I'm okay with that.

19:10.063 --> 19:12.766
We are clearly outnumbered here,
yes?

19:12.799 --> 19:15.135
I suggest we retreat,
regroup and strategize.

19:15.168 --> 19:16.903
‐Fine.
‐Yes!

19:16.937 --> 19:20.474
It has been so wonderful
to meet you, Wes.

19:20.507 --> 19:21.575
‐Genuinely.
‐Yeah.

19:21.608 --> 19:22.876
You have given us so much to...

19:22.909 --> 19:25.712
‐(grunts)
‐Hey... Shit.

19:27.914 --> 19:28.915
COLIN:
Saw that coming.

19:28.949 --> 19:30.150
Oh, shit.

19:30.183 --> 19:31.585
(Nadja chuckles)

19:31.618 --> 19:33.720
Oh, look at that.

19:33.754 --> 19:36.023
Council dues are due
on the first full moon

19:36.056 --> 19:37.524
‐of every month.
‐Okay.
‐Yeah.

19:37.557 --> 19:38.525
Any questions?

19:38.558 --> 19:39.926
Didn't think so.

19:39.960 --> 19:41.028
Respect your elders.

19:41.061 --> 19:43.463
Colin Robinson, get my cape.

19:43.497 --> 19:44.765
‐Got it.
‐How's that for an old lady?

19:44.798 --> 19:46.767
Hey, you take care now, Dave.

19:46.800 --> 19:48.035
(squeaking)

19:49.202 --> 19:50.904
NANDOR:
I'm going to see my sweet Meg,

19:50.937 --> 19:52.873
knowing that Laszlo
and his silver tongue

19:52.906 --> 19:54.908
have laid a foundation for me

19:54.942 --> 19:57.144
‐has given me a new confidence.
‐(entry bell rings)

19:57.177 --> 19:59.112
Hey, back again.

19:59.146 --> 20:00.981
‐My lucky night.
‐Yes.

20:02.015 --> 20:03.884
I know I was here earlier.

20:03.917 --> 20:06.453
You made me laugh very much,

20:06.486 --> 20:09.790
when we talked about, uh...

20:09.823 --> 20:12.059
The guy who works for you,
Guillermo?

20:12.092 --> 20:15.629
‐Really?
‐You seem really into him.

20:15.662 --> 20:17.130
That's really
what we were talking about?

20:18.565 --> 20:20.067
It's just that, uh...

20:20.100 --> 20:22.436
How should I put this?

20:23.203 --> 20:26.840
Meg, it is you who are
the person that I am into.

20:26.873 --> 20:29.443
I believe that you are
the love of my life.

20:29.476 --> 20:32.145
I believe that we should be
together forever.

20:32.179 --> 20:33.747
You know I'm not into guys,
right?

20:33.780 --> 20:35.582
I‐I like women.

20:36.550 --> 20:37.884
So do I.

20:37.918 --> 20:39.152
You like men and women.
That's okay.

20:39.186 --> 20:41.154
Yes, and you like women and men?

20:41.188 --> 20:43.123
No, just women.
I'm a lesbian.

20:43.156 --> 20:45.559
‐Are you sure?
‐Definitely sure.

20:47.194 --> 20:48.528
You will remember nothing.

20:48.562 --> 20:50.130
‐Fuck.
‐Fuckface.

20:50.163 --> 20:51.999
I thought I told you to never
show your face‐‐ (grunts)

20:52.032 --> 20:53.066
‐(Meg gasping)
‐Oops.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.868
Fucking guy.

20:55.902 --> 20:58.138
Are you okay?

20:59.740 --> 21:02.643
‐Open.
‐Hey, Nadja.

21:02.676 --> 21:04.911
I have just commenced
my slumber.

21:04.945 --> 21:07.481
What happened in Queens tonight
can never, ever happen again.

21:07.514 --> 21:09.016
What is wrong with you?

21:09.049 --> 21:10.851
I don't know.

21:10.884 --> 21:12.953
Has living in America made you
into a big, wet pussy?

21:13.920 --> 21:16.990
I think I've just been going
through some things lately.

21:17.024 --> 21:18.592
Do you ever
wonder that maybe

21:18.625 --> 21:20.027
there is more to this life

21:20.060 --> 21:22.763
than just mindless killing
and bloodlust?

21:22.796 --> 21:24.865
‐Yeah.
‐You do?

21:24.898 --> 21:26.667
No! Of course not!

21:26.700 --> 21:29.169
That is because you have Laszlo
to share your life with!

21:29.202 --> 21:30.804
Oh! (speaks in foreign language)

21:30.837 --> 21:32.973
You have turned into
a very, very soft boy.

21:33.006 --> 21:34.608
How about you slumber on that?

21:34.641 --> 21:35.976
‐Good night!
‐Hey!

21:40.013 --> 21:41.548
(chuckles)

21:43.050 --> 21:44.418
Hmm.

21:45.619 --> 21:47.187
What is it now?

21:47.220 --> 21:49.156
(both scream)

21:49.189 --> 21:51.024
‐Pussy!
‐Go away!

21:51.058 --> 21:53.126
You are a scared
little soft boy.

21:53.160 --> 21:56.530
Speaking of soft, I'm squeezing
your pipi right now.

21:56.563 --> 21:57.597
‐How do you like that?
‐(groans)

21:57.631 --> 21:58.999
Get your hands off my pipi!

21:59.032 --> 22:00.634
It is like a piece of
extra meat dangling

22:00.667 --> 22:02.169
‐off the end of my body.
‐Get your hands off it!

22:02.202 --> 22:04.504
Laszlo, you know that thing
you always wanted to try?

22:04.538 --> 22:06.506
