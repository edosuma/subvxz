10:02.118 --> 10:04.420
WE'RE COLLECTING INJURIES,
AND I'M PULLING THE PLUG.

10:04.453 --> 10:06.489
- GIVE HIM TILL THE END
OF THE WEEK.

10:06.522 --> 10:09.125
- [laughs]

10:09.125 --> 10:10.526
YOU REALIZE
THAT WE'VE ALREADY

10:10.559 --> 10:15.164
GONE OUT ON A LIMB
ON THIS TWICE.

10:15.197 --> 10:17.266
- PUT MIKE UNDER ME.
I'LL RUN THE OP.

10:20.369 --> 10:23.539
- OKAY.
BUT IF IT GOES BAD...

10:23.572 --> 10:25.374
- THEN I'LL TAKE THE HIT.

10:25.408 --> 10:27.309
- YES, YOU WILL.

10:28.477 --> 10:29.912
[door opens]

10:40.289 --> 10:42.291
- BIRMINGHAM GREYHOUND DEPOT,
HUH?

10:42.291 --> 10:45.327
- YES, SIR.
GOOD MUSIC, BETTER BARBECUE.

10:45.361 --> 10:48.097
[laughs]

10:48.130 --> 10:51.267
BUT I MOVED BACK HERE, SO...

10:51.300 --> 10:55.504
I MEAN, YOU CAN GO AHEAD
AND CALL MY REFERENCES.

10:55.538 --> 10:57.206
- I'M NOT WORRIED
ABOUT YOUR SKILLS.

10:57.239 --> 10:59.308
- HMM.

10:59.308 --> 11:02.178
- I AM WORRIED
ABOUT THE WARNING SIGNS.

11:02.178 --> 11:03.379
- WARNING SIGNS?

11:03.412 --> 11:05.081
- TRIED TO MASK IT,

11:05.114 --> 11:08.150
BUT I'M A BLOODHOUND
WHEN IT COMES TO WHISKEY.

11:08.184 --> 11:10.219
CAN'T STOP IT
FROM SEEPING OUT OF YOUR PORES.

11:10.252 --> 11:11.587
- WHAT? YOU TOLD ME TO GET HIM
IN THE SHOWER,

11:11.620 --> 11:12.655
NOT SCRUB HIS TAINT.

11:12.888 --> 11:14.957
- I HAD A COUPLE LAST NIGHT,
BUT...

11:14.990 --> 11:16.492
YOU KNOW,
SCOTCH ISN'T ILLEGAL.

11:16.525 --> 11:19.261
- YEAH,
I REMEMBER THOSE DAYS.

11:19.295 --> 11:20.463
THE LIFE I WANTED
WAS RIGHT HERE,

11:20.496 --> 11:21.997
BUT I WAS BURNING RUBBER

11:22.031 --> 11:23.532
IN THE EXACT
AND OPPOSITE DIRECTION,

11:23.566 --> 11:25.434
AND YOU KNOW HOW I FIXED IT?

11:25.468 --> 11:26.469
- ASKED SIRI?

11:26.502 --> 11:30.306
- I GOT CLEAN.
NOT A DROP SINCE 1998.

11:30.339 --> 11:33.042
- WOW.
CONGRATULATIONS.

11:33.075 --> 11:34.543
- [sighs]
I DON'T NEED A PARADE.

11:34.577 --> 11:36.946
I DID
WHAT WAS NECESSARY FOR ME.

11:36.946 --> 11:41.350
- LOOK, I HAD ONE BAD NIGHT
LAST NIGHT, OKAY?

11:41.383 --> 11:44.120
THIS IS NOT GONNA BE A REGULAR
THING, I CAN ASSURE YOU.

11:44.153 --> 11:46.355
- I AM SURE
YOU'RE A DECENT ENOUGH MECHANIC,

11:46.388 --> 11:48.157
BUT I NEED GUYS
I CAN RELY ON.

11:48.190 --> 11:50.559
- YEAH. I'M THAT GUY.

11:50.593 --> 11:53.229
- NO, YOU'RE NOT, NOT YET.

11:58.200 --> 12:00.436
- I SHOULD HAVE WENT
WITH ZELANSKI.

12:00.469 --> 12:01.971
- YOU KNOW WHAT YOUR PROBLEM IS,
WARREN?

12:02.004 --> 12:04.573
- WHAT'S THAT?
- YOU'VE GOT NO LOYALTY.

12:04.607 --> 12:07.977
- I THINK I JUST GOT BENT OVER
BY LOYALTY.

12:12.948 --> 12:15.551
- D.J., LISTEN, MAN.

12:17.219 --> 12:19.488
[inaudible dialogue]

12:23.926 --> 12:26.328
- WHAT WAS THAT?

12:26.362 --> 12:28.264
- YOU SAID
YOU NEED HANDS ON THAT BUS.

12:28.297 --> 12:30.166
JAKES IS THE GUY
WHO CAN GET IT DONE.

12:30.199 --> 12:32.168
- WHAT'D YOU GIVE HIM?

12:32.201 --> 12:33.569
- LOYALTY.

12:47.049 --> 12:49.952
- LOOK, I SAID WE'RE DONE.

12:49.985 --> 12:52.254
- SIX MONTHS.

12:52.254 --> 12:53.956
THIS IS THE MOST TIME
I COULD EVER GET.

12:53.989 --> 12:58.160
I SWEAR TO GOD, MAN, I'M TRYING,
BUT I DON'T GOT A BLUEPRINT.

12:58.194 --> 13:01.330
- YOU STILL GOING TO MEETINGS?
- YEAH, ALL THE TIME.

13:01.363 --> 13:03.666
YOU KNOW HOW IT IS, YOU GET
SOME SH---Y NEWS, AND...

13:03.666 --> 13:06.202

WITH A GLASS IN MY HAND.

13:06.235 --> 13:09.338
- YEAH, WELL, YOU NEED TO FIND
THE RIGHT ENVIRONMENT.

13:09.371 --> 13:12.241
- I KNOW.
THAT'S WHY I CAME BACK.

13:12.274 --> 13:13.642
I NEED THE STRUCTURE,
AND--

13:13.676 --> 13:15.277
LISTEN,
I KNOW I CAN DO THE WORK.

13:15.311 --> 13:18.247
- I'M NOT HIRING A PROJECT HERE.
I'M HIRING AN EMPLOYEE.

13:18.280 --> 13:20.216
- BUT I KNOW YOU UNDERSTAND.

13:20.249 --> 13:22.218
SOMEONE GAVE YOU
A SECOND CHANCE, RIGHT?

13:22.251 --> 13:24.620
- [sighs]

13:24.653 --> 13:26.155
YOU CAN START TOMORROW?

13:26.155 --> 13:27.489
- ABSOLUTELY.

13:27.523 --> 13:29.158
- I'LL BE HERE, RESTED...
- YES!

13:29.191 --> 13:31.160
- AND READY
TO START AT 8:00 A.M.

13:31.193 --> 13:33.128
- THANK GOD
FOR SAVIOR COMPLEXES.

13:33.162 --> 13:34.630
- MM!

13:43.906 --> 13:46.408
- HEY, SWEET THING.

13:46.442 --> 13:48.110
- YOU GOING BACK
TO THE PARLOR?

13:48.143 --> 13:50.246
- MIKE WANTS ME TO SEE
IF THERE'S ANY STREET CHATTER

13:50.279 --> 13:52.548
ABOUT PAIGE'S GIRLS
AND SOLANO.

13:52.581 --> 13:54.083
PLUS I WAS HOPING
MAYBE I COULD CATCH

13:54.116 --> 13:55.451
SOMETHING THAT COULD HELP US.

13:55.451 --> 13:57.453
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
HUH?

13:57.453 --> 13:58.954
- I TALKED TO THE FBI TODAY

13:58.988 --> 14:01.390
AND PRETENDED TO BE
ONE OF KELLY'S LAWYERS.

14:01.423 --> 14:02.625
- AND?

14:02.658 --> 14:05.027
- AND I SAID THAT JANGLES
IS A SERIAL KILLER,

14:05.060 --> 14:06.395
HE HAD JUAN'S KEY
ON HIS KEY RING--

14:06.428 --> 14:08.030
GIVE HER THE GODDAMN MONEY!

14:08.063 --> 14:09.465
- HOW'D THAT GO FOR YOU?
- NOT GOOD.

14:09.465 --> 14:10.966
THEY'RE NOT GOING
TO GIVE HER SH--,

14:11.000 --> 14:12.935
SO WE HAVE TO GET IT FOR HER.

14:12.935 --> 14:14.670
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT,
CHUCK?

14:14.903 --> 14:16.939
WHAT DO WE HAVE TO DO?
WE GOING TO ROB A BANK?

14:16.972 --> 14:20.576
- WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANYTHING.
I HAVE TO DO SOMETHING.

14:30.586 --> 14:33.055
- THIS IS REALLY,
REALLY IMPRESSIVE.

14:33.088 --> 14:35.424
LIKE, CIRQUE DU SOLEIL-LEVEL
BENDINESS.

14:35.457 --> 14:37.426
- SHOULDN'T HE HAVE GIVEN US
THE TAKEDOWN BY NOW?

14:37.459 --> 14:39.561
- HE'S JUST DOING
A REALLY THOROUGH JOB

14:39.595 --> 14:41.597
OF MAKING SURE
IT'S A BROTHEL.

14:41.630 --> 14:43.265
- OH, SHE'S DOPE.

14:43.299 --> 14:45.467
CAN I MIX AND MATCH,
LIKE AT 31 FLAVORS?

14:45.501 --> 14:47.903
[laughter]
- JUST SAY IT, JOHNNY.

14:47.936 --> 14:49.305
- THOSE ALL THE OPTIONS?

14:49.338 --> 14:51.307
NO ONE HIDING IN THE BACK
OR ANYTHING?

14:51.340 --> 14:54.243
WELL, THEN, I REALLY HATE
TO ASK THIS, MORE THAN YOU KNOW,

14:54.243 --> 14:56.912
BUT DO YOU TAKE
AMERICAN EXPRESS?

14:56.945 --> 14:59.048
- THAT'S IT, GO.
GO, GO, GO!

15:00.616 --> 15:02.885
- OH, LOOK, I THOUGHT
IT WAS A TEAHOUSE!

15:02.918 --> 15:05.521
LOOK, I JUST WANTED TO GET
SOME OOLONG, I SWEAR TO GOD!

15:05.554 --> 15:07.089
DAMN!

15:07.089 --> 15:09.124
- YOU'RE UNDER ARREST FOR
THE SOLICITATION OF PROSTITUTION

15:09.158 --> 15:10.893
AND OPERATING A HOUSE
OF ILL FAME.

15:10.926 --> 15:12.561
- MY GIRLS ARE HOSTESSES,
NOTHING MORE!

15:12.594 --> 15:14.363
- MM-HMM,
GOOD LUCK PROVING THAT.

15:14.396 --> 15:16.165
I'M ABOUT TO MAKE YOUR LIFE
A LIVING HELL,

15:16.198 --> 15:18.500
UNLESS YOU COOPERATE.
- COOPERATE?

15:18.534 --> 15:20.636
- TELL ME
ABOUT THE PINK BACKPACKS.

15:20.669 --> 15:22.538
- BACKPACKS?
WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

15:22.538 --> 15:24.540
- THE EASTERN EUROPEAN GIRLS
THAT COME IN FROM MEXICO

15:24.573 --> 15:26.542
AND GET DROPPED OFF HERE
IN SYLMAR.

15:26.542 --> 15:29.144
- TALK TO MY LAWYER.

15:31.080 --> 15:33.215
- GET IN.

15:35.951 --> 15:37.986
- DON'T LET HER TAKE ME.
DON'T LET HER TAKE--

15:38.020 --> 15:40.289
OW, OKAY.
- SHE'S INVOLVED.

15:40.322 --> 15:42.391
- YOU SURE?

15:42.391 --> 15:46.228
- SHE KNOWS SOMETHING,
AND SHE JUST LAWYERED UP.

15:46.261 --> 15:49.231
- ALL RIGHT, SO FIND YOURSELF
A LOOPHOLE, P.

15:49.264 --> 15:51.133
COME ON, GET YOUR GIRL.

16:00.387 --> 16:02.044
STILL THINKING ABOUT HOW
YOUR CRAZY ASS

16:02.044 --> 16:04.146
ENDED UP ALL BLOODY
THE OTHER DAY.

16:04.179 --> 16:06.448
I GOT A FEELING YOU LIKE
WALKING ON THE WILD SIDE.

16:06.448 --> 16:08.584
FRIDAY NIGHT, ME AND THE BOYS
ARE HITTING UP SOME CLUBS.

16:08.617 --> 16:10.452
MY PLACE.

16:10.486 --> 16:13.288

MM!

16:13.322 --> 16:15.524
SO I GUESS CARLITO LIKED
THE PISTOLS I GOT HIM.

16:15.557 --> 16:17.059
- HMM.

16:17.092 --> 16:20.028
- I WAS THINKING MAYBE WE COULD
STICK WITH THE SAME THEME,

16:20.062 --> 16:23.298
YOU KNOW, LIKE, AMAZE HIM
WITH A BOTTLE OF THAT TEQUILA

16:23.332 --> 16:24.900
THAT WE GOT.

16:24.933 --> 16:26.935
WHAT YOU THINK?
YEAH? NO?

16:26.969 --> 16:29.271
- LISTEN, MAN, I'M GLAD

16:29.304 --> 16:30.506
YOU'RE HEADING INTO THIS THING
FULL THROTTLE,

16:30.539 --> 16:31.907
BUT LEST WE FORGET,

16:31.940 --> 16:35.310
THAT GUY SHOT HIS OWN MAN
IN THE NECK FOR FUN.

16:35.310 --> 16:36.945
- SO YOU'RE SAYING BE CAREFUL?

16:36.945 --> 16:39.214
- I'M SAYING, WHY STAND OUT
WHEN YOU CAN BLEND IN?

16:39.214 --> 16:40.949
YOU'VE ALREADY SHOWN HIM
JOHNNY THE AMAZING.

16:40.983 --> 16:42.551
MAYBE NOW IT'S TIME
TO FALL BACK A LITTLE BIT,

16:42.584 --> 16:44.319
JUST BE ONE OF THE POSSE.

16:47.556 --> 16:50.559
[tattoo machines buzzing]

16:50.592 --> 16:52.961
- YOU'RE MAKING SURE
HER EYES ARE HAUNTING, RIGHT?

16:52.995 --> 16:55.330

17:02.070 --> 17:03.305
LAREZO WANTS ANOTHER DAGGER.

17:03.338 --> 17:05.040

- YEAH.

17:05.073 --> 17:07.476

THE KING OF THE WEST SIDE.

17:14.950 --> 17:16.518
YOU THINK YOU MIGHT BE ABLE
TO INTRODUCE ME?

17:16.552 --> 17:19.154
- WHY DO YOU WANT TO MEET HIM?

17:19.188 --> 17:21.056
- PROFESSIONAL INTEREST.

17:21.089 --> 17:22.324
- YOU A JUNKIE?

17:22.357 --> 17:23.892

17:28.230 --> 17:29.531
I MEAN, ARE YOU GOING
TO WASTE HIS TIME?

17:29.565 --> 17:31.200
HE AIN'T INTO THAT SH--.

17:31.233 --> 17:32.935
- NO, I'M LEGIT.

17:32.968 --> 17:34.369
I JUST INHERITED
A STABLE OF HORSES.

ANY OVERTIME OPPORTUNITIES

18:10.239 --> 18:11.640
OR ANYTHING, YOU KNOW,
I'M YOUR MAN.

18:11.673 --> 18:13.642
- YOU NEED THE DOUGH, OR YOU
JUST TRYING TO STAY TOO BUSY

18:13.675 --> 18:15.143
NOT TO LAND UP IN A BAR?

18:15.143 --> 18:16.979

I CAN'T LIE.

18:17.012 --> 18:18.947

YOU SHOW ME
SOME MORE STABILITY,

ABOUT THE EXTRA GREEN.

18:23.385 --> 18:24.987
- THANK YOU.

18:41.537 --> 18:43.171
118.

18:43.171 --> 18:45.173
118'S OUR MAGIC NUMBER.

18:45.207 --> 18:48.010
EVERY OTHER BUS FLOWS IN, OUT,
NO PROBLEM.

18:48.043 --> 18:50.679
118 GETS IN BAY FIVE,
FULL LOCKDOWN.

18:50.913 --> 18:52.381
- ONE BUS, ONE BAY.

18:52.414 --> 18:54.316
AH, THAT MAKES OUR JOB
A WHOLE LOT EASIER.

18:54.349 --> 18:55.551
- SO WHAT'S OUR NEXT MOVE?

18:55.551 --> 18:58.487
- NEXT MOVE IS WE GET 118 ALONE,
GIVE MY GUYS 20 MINUTES,

18:58.520 --> 19:00.022
THEY TEAR THAT THING
BOLT FROM BOLT.

19:00.055 --> 19:01.557
FIND OUT
HOW THEY'RE HIDING THE PRODUCT,

19:01.590 --> 19:03.091
PLANT SOME TRACKERS,
AND TRACE THAT THING

19:03.125 --> 19:04.293
ALL THE WAY BACK
TO THE CARTEL.

19:04.326 --> 19:06.562
- FOLLOW THE DRUGS TO THE MONEY,
THE MONEY TO SOLANO.

19:06.595 --> 19:08.030
- EXACTLY.

19:08.063 --> 19:09.565
WHAT KIND OF SECURITY
THEY GOT ON THAT BAY?

19:09.565 --> 19:12.134
- IT'S LIKE
A FOB KEY CARD THING.

19:12.167 --> 19:14.570
- YOU THINK YOU COULD GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO LAWRENCE

19:14.603 --> 19:16.238
TO MAKE A MIRROR
OF HIS KEY CARD?

19:16.271 --> 19:18.307
- GIVE ME THE TECHNOLOGY,
I'LL MAKE IT HAPPEN.

19:18.340 --> 19:19.608
- MAKE IT HAPPEN BY TOMORROW?

19:19.641 --> 19:24.546
- DON'T YOU WORRY
YOUR PRETTY LITTLE BLOND HEAD.

19:29.384 --> 19:30.419
- WHERE IS MY LAWYER?

19:30.452 --> 19:32.454
- IN HOMELAND SECURITY THREATS,

19:32.454 --> 19:34.323
THEY DON'T GET LAWYERS
RIGHT AWAY.

19:34.356 --> 19:36.458
WE GET TO TAKE OUR TIME.

19:36.491 --> 19:38.627
WE TOOK A LOOK AT THE COMPUTER
AT YOUR OFFICE.

19:38.660 --> 19:40.462
TURNS OUT
YOU'VE BEEN CORRESPONDING

19:40.462 --> 19:42.564
WITH A SUSPECTED
XINJIANG SEPARATIST.

19:42.598 --> 19:45.901
- THESE ARE EMAILS TO A NURSE
TAKING CARE OF MY PARENTS.

19:45.934 --> 19:47.169
- ON THE SURFACE,

19:47.202 --> 19:49.538
