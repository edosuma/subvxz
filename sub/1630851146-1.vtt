WEBVTT

00:56.558 --> 00:58.191
You got this.

01:01.563 --> 01:03.230
I thought
it was a surprise party.

01:03.263 --> 01:04.398
<i>Yeah, I know.</i>

01:04.431 --> 01:05.700
<i>I think Mom thought so, too.</i>

01:05.733 --> 01:09.336
Uh, it was
supposed to be a surprise,

01:09.369 --> 01:10.872
until Mom
decided to ask Delilah...

01:10.905 --> 01:13.440
Oh, no, no, no, no!
Don't you dare blame me.

01:13.473 --> 01:14.842
<i>Hi, Mom!</i>

01:14.876 --> 01:16.276
Hi, honey. How are you?

01:16.310 --> 01:17.277
- <i>I'm good.</i>
- Good.

01:17.311 --> 01:19.379
And how's work with the, um...

01:19.413 --> 01:20.247
<i>carry-on luggage campaign?</i>

01:20.280 --> 01:21.481
<i>How's that going?</i>

01:21.516 --> 01:23.450
Mom, we launched that
like a month ago.

01:23.483 --> 01:24.595
<i>Didn't you get those samples
I sent you?</i>

01:24.619 --> 01:25.653
- No...
- I stole them.

01:25.687 --> 01:27.321
You what?

01:27.354 --> 01:28.499
<i>I actually have
four accounts this quarter...</i>

01:28.523 --> 01:29.524
a men's sock line,

01:29.557 --> 01:30.525
there's a vitamin line...

01:30.558 --> 01:32.159
<i>Wow! Life in the big city.</i>

01:32.192 --> 01:33.327
Yeah, and then

01:33.360 --> 01:34.328
they have me auditioning
for an account

01:34.361 --> 01:35.438
to rebrand a water company.

01:35.462 --> 01:37.599
So! Aunt Josie...

01:37.632 --> 01:40.434
did you send me
a birthday present?

01:40.467 --> 01:42.503
Delilah, come on,
put down the phone

01:42.537 --> 01:43.805
and come... hi, Josie!

01:43.838 --> 01:45.573
Hi, Aaron! Yes, Delilah.

01:45.607 --> 01:46.808
Auntie Jo sent you

01:46.841 --> 01:48.208
a very cool birthday present.

01:48.241 --> 01:49.309
<i>It's make-up.</i>

01:49.343 --> 01:50.578
<i>But, listen,</i>

01:50.612 --> 01:51.889
<i>please don't let your mom
show you how to use it.</i>

01:51.913 --> 01:53.748
- Wait until I get there, okay?
- Cool!

01:53.781 --> 01:56.751
You do realize
I can hear you, right?

01:56.784 --> 01:59.286
And are you criticizing
my... my contouring?

01:59.319 --> 02:00.755
<i>Oh, my goodness.</i>

02:00.788 --> 02:02.398
Everybody back to work!
We got a ton of stuff to do.

02:02.422 --> 02:03.591
Oh.

02:03.625 --> 02:05.359
- <i>Hi, Dad!</i>
- Hey, Josie.

02:05.392 --> 02:06.637
I hear you're not coming
for the party.

02:06.661 --> 02:07.729
Yeah. I've got to work.

02:07.762 --> 02:09.329
<i>Busiest girl I know.</i>

02:09.363 --> 02:10.798
Doing my best.

02:10.832 --> 02:11.899
<i>Oh. Say hi to Ben.</i>

02:11.933 --> 02:12.933
Hey, Ben.

02:14.669 --> 02:15.570
<i>So, about that make-up...</i>

02:15.603 --> 02:17.404
Uh... thank you.

02:17.437 --> 02:18.673
Hey.

02:18.706 --> 02:19.907
Everything good, Jo?

02:19.941 --> 02:21.408
Yeah. I'm okay.

02:21.441 --> 02:22.777
Tell me.

02:22.810 --> 02:24.478
<i>Well, there's just
a lot going on.</i>

02:24.512 --> 02:26.179
You know, I'm up
for this new account,

02:26.213 --> 02:27.791
and I'm actually training
for a Spartan race.

02:27.815 --> 02:28.850
A what?

02:28.883 --> 02:30.450
A Spartan race.

02:30.484 --> 02:32.395
You know, you go through
all these gnarly obstacles

02:32.419 --> 02:33.597
and then there's, like,
freezing-cold water

02:33.621 --> 02:36.390
and then
this gross mud part, and...

02:36.423 --> 02:38.863
You know what? I just decided
I am never doing a Spartan race.

02:40.427 --> 02:41.863
Oh, I miss you.

02:41.896 --> 02:43.564
Oh, I miss you, too.

02:43.598 --> 02:45.633
I'll see you next month, though,
when I come down.

02:45.667 --> 02:47.547
<i>Ellie, you gonna
help with the balloons already?</i>

02:48.435 --> 02:50.303
Seriously, Dad.

02:50.337 --> 02:52.239
All right.
Uh, I will talk to you soon.

02:52.272 --> 02:53.641
I love you, Jojo.

02:53.675 --> 02:55.442
Love you more.

02:56.811 --> 02:58.245
And that's why

02:58.278 --> 02:59.723
we, at Best Foot Forward,
want you to say,

02:59.747 --> 03:00.848
"goodbye, FreshWater"

03:00.882 --> 03:03.316
from unglamorous
Upstate New York,

03:03.350 --> 03:06.854
and "hello" to a delicious
European alternative...

03:06.888 --> 03:08.488
VodaSpring.

03:09.624 --> 03:11.693
Oh, thank you, Josie.

03:11.726 --> 03:12.960
So, my friends,

03:12.994 --> 03:15.362
if you choose to give us
the VodaSpring account...

03:15.395 --> 03:17.230
What's that? "Voda"?

03:17.264 --> 03:18.866
VodaSpring. It's Czech.

03:18.900 --> 03:21.401
But our water...
like, the actual water...

03:21.435 --> 03:22.770
it's still from upstate, right?

03:22.804 --> 03:24.271
Just a new label?

03:24.304 --> 03:26.473
Same water, new name?

03:26.507 --> 03:29.409
We prefer to call it
a rebranding and a relaunch.

03:30.578 --> 03:31.846
And we call it...

03:33.715 --> 03:34.816
you got a deal.

03:38.019 --> 03:39.921
Cheers.

03:39.954 --> 03:41.354
Thanks, Tony.

03:41.388 --> 03:43.290
You know, we both had good days.

03:43.323 --> 03:44.601
The rules committee
is considering

03:44.625 --> 03:45.803
my pitch
for resetting the shot clock.

03:45.827 --> 03:47.461
Look at that!

03:47.494 --> 03:49.396
That's amazing, Mr. Basketball.

03:49.429 --> 03:51.666
Good for you.

03:51.699 --> 03:53.968
You know, I-I wanted to ask you
about your...

03:54.001 --> 03:56.303
your schedule for next month.

03:56.336 --> 03:59.040
Next month?
Uh, I'm working 24/7.

03:59.073 --> 04:00.818
Heavy game schedule.
I'll be on the road a lot.

04:00.842 --> 04:02.610
Oh.

04:02.643 --> 04:04.377
Yeah. That's what I figured.

04:04.411 --> 04:06.581
It's cool.

04:06.614 --> 04:07.791
Because I'm actually
thinking about

04:07.815 --> 04:08.859
going back to New Hope
to see my family.

04:08.883 --> 04:09.984
North Carolina!

04:10.017 --> 04:11.519
Nice.

04:11.552 --> 04:12.730
It'd just be fun to hang out
with my sister

04:12.754 --> 04:13.721
and play
with my niece and nephew.

04:13.755 --> 04:15.890
Delilah and Ben.

04:15.923 --> 04:16.858
You remembered.

04:16.891 --> 04:19.060
Of course I did.

04:19.093 --> 04:20.895
I mean, you talk about them
all the time.

04:20.928 --> 04:23.664
Well... because
they're great kids.

04:25.066 --> 04:26.577
I mean, they're way cooler
than I was at their age.

04:26.601 --> 04:28.002
Oh, yeah.
The awkward teen years.

04:28.035 --> 04:29.046
I gotta see a picture of that.

04:29.070 --> 04:31.038
No. Yeah, no. You really don't.

04:31.072 --> 04:33.340
So when are you back?

04:33.373 --> 04:34.976
Uh, a week. Yeah, just a week.

04:35.009 --> 04:35.977
Perfect.

04:36.010 --> 04:37.612
I mean, I'm guessing

04:37.645 --> 04:38.889
there's only so much to do
in a place like New Hope.

04:38.913 --> 04:40.347
Well, I mean...

04:40.380 --> 04:41.390
That's the joy
of the quick visit.

04:41.414 --> 04:42.583
You see everyone you love

04:42.617 --> 04:43.416
and then,
just when you've had your fill,

04:43.450 --> 04:44.890
you come right back home
to the city.

04:47.588 --> 04:48.990
Yeah.

04:53.594 --> 04:54.996
So I'm thinking we do

04:55.029 --> 04:56.607
the OurSox photo shoot
on four different surfaces...

04:56.631 --> 04:57.999
wood, sand, water, and grass.

04:58.032 --> 04:59.600
You got that, Carol?

04:59.634 --> 05:01.011
And then we're also gonna
need the new radio teaser

05:01.035 --> 05:02.402
for LYL Vitamins,

05:02.435 --> 05:03.914
and then, on VodaSpring,
we do a relaunch

05:03.938 --> 05:06.507
with a new TV
and Internet campaign,

05:06.541 --> 05:07.340
so we're gonna need
all new music.

05:07.374 --> 05:08.509
Uh-huh.

05:08.543 --> 05:10.645
Huh. They were
supposed to be navy.

05:10.678 --> 05:11.846
You know, I don't know

05:11.879 --> 05:13.681
how you juggle so many balls
like this.

05:13.714 --> 05:15.358
Oh. You just got to focus on
the one that's in front of you.

05:15.382 --> 05:16.827
Someday, someone's gonna
throw a curve ball your way.

05:16.851 --> 05:18.019
Oh. Can't wait.

05:19.486 --> 05:21.522
Yeah, maybe baseball's
not your sport.

05:21.556 --> 05:23.024
That was more of
a golf swing, yeah.

05:23.057 --> 05:24.625
Okay. All caught up.

05:25.660 --> 05:27.028
Oh, guys, sorry.

05:27.061 --> 05:29.496
It's my mom.
She hasn't mastered texting yet.

05:29.530 --> 05:31.364
Just two seconds. Hey, Mom.

05:31.398 --> 05:32.533
Josie!

05:32.567 --> 05:34.035
Oh, honey.
I'm so glad you answered.

05:34.068 --> 05:35.368
Is everything okay?

05:35.402 --> 05:36.436
<i>Is it Dad?</i>

05:36.469 --> 05:37.815
<i>Did he get up
on that ladder again?</i>

05:37.839 --> 05:38.982
I told him
not to get on the ladder.

05:39.006 --> 05:40.074
<i>Josie.</i>

05:40.107 --> 05:42.143
It's your sister...

05:42.176 --> 05:44.612
and Aaron.

05:44.645 --> 05:46.379
<i>We don't have
all the details yet,</i>

05:46.413 --> 05:47.982
<i>but apparently a truck...</i>

05:49.416 --> 05:51.586
<i>a truck crossed over...</i>

07:02.790 --> 07:04.191
Thank you.

07:32.987 --> 07:35.189
I am so glad you're home.

07:44.832 --> 07:46.200
Where's Jeff?

07:46.233 --> 07:49.103
Um...
some of his friends came by,

07:49.136 --> 07:51.605
you know, just to be with him.

07:51.639 --> 07:53.074
Yeah.

07:53.107 --> 07:54.275
And the kids?

07:54.308 --> 07:56.143
They're upstairs in their rooms.

07:56.177 --> 07:58.079
Delilah's...

07:58.112 --> 08:00.480
handling it a lot better
than Ben.

08:02.149 --> 08:04.094
Do you think it would be okay
if I... if I went to see them?

08:04.118 --> 08:06.486
Nothing better.

08:30.778 --> 08:32.513
Do you want some company?

08:43.124 --> 08:45.092
Maybe tomorrow I could show you

08:45.126 --> 08:47.528
how to put on that make-up
I sent you for your birthday.

08:48.763 --> 08:50.798
Okay.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.066
Will you rub my neck?

08:53.234 --> 08:56.203
Of course.

08:56.237 --> 08:58.973
Like... like this?

08:59.006 --> 09:00.608
Harder.

09:00.641 --> 09:02.109
Mom does it really hard.

09:04.145 --> 09:05.946
I'm so sorry, honey.

09:08.282 --> 09:10.651
I feel so... empty.

09:12.386 --> 09:15.923
I don't know how I feel so empty
but so full.

09:17.324 --> 09:19.026
It can be both.

09:19.060 --> 09:22.296
Like, emptiness...

09:22.329 --> 09:23.898
you almost...

09:23.931 --> 09:25.599
don't feel like you have
any room left

09:25.633 --> 09:28.002
for feeling any more empty.

09:28.035 --> 09:29.203
Is that what you mean?

09:31.939 --> 09:34.642
I feel the same.

09:37.278 --> 09:38.646
How's your brother?

09:38.679 --> 09:40.781
It's hard to tell.

09:44.185 --> 09:45.986
How about I go check on him?

09:49.924 --> 09:50.791
Hey, Aunt Josie.

09:50.825 --> 09:52.059
Yeah?

09:52.093 --> 09:53.594
Catch.

09:56.297 --> 09:58.341
You weren't very good at sports
when you were a kid, were you?

09:58.365 --> 10:00.634
Well, let's just say I, uh...

10:00.668 --> 10:02.803
I barely got
the "participation" ribbon.

10:04.371 --> 10:06.006
I'm so glad you came.

10:09.777 --> 10:11.679
Delilah, I'm always gonna
be here for you, okay?

10:14.181 --> 10:15.683
I love you.

10:15.716 --> 10:17.251
I love you, too.

10:19.086 --> 10:21.622
Oh, come here. Come here.

10:26.827 --> 10:28.896
It's gonna be okay.

10:42.076 --> 10:43.077
That's really pretty.

10:43.110 --> 10:45.079
Is that a new song?

10:45.112 --> 10:46.113
Please go away.

10:47.882 --> 10:49.459
If you want to...
you want to talk, or...

10:49.483 --> 10:51.886
No.

10:54.955 --> 10:57.057
Okay.

11:31.025 --> 11:32.026
Oh, she just kicked!

11:32.059 --> 11:33.761
Oh, I felt it.

11:33.794 --> 11:35.296
Do you hear that, Ben?

11:35.329 --> 11:37.007
Your little sister's getting
ready to make her appearance.

11:37.031 --> 11:38.208
Okay, just one more shot.
Last one.

11:38.232 --> 11:39.466
Okay, okay.

11:39.500 --> 11:40.777
Okay, Josie, yeah,
keep the hand on the baby,

11:40.801 --> 11:42.161
and El,
just put your hand on hers.

11:43.237 --> 11:44.738
Ah! She just kicked again.

11:44.772 --> 11:45.906
- Mm-hmm.
- Aw!

11:55.316 --> 11:56.518
Hey, sis.

11:56.551 --> 11:59.153
Jeff.

11:59.186 --> 12:01.422
I was looking for you earlier.

12:01.455 --> 12:03.991
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

12:04.024 --> 12:06.269
I've just been overwhelmed
trying to help out with things,

12:06.293 --> 12:08.028
- you know?
- I'm so worried about the kids.

12:08.062 --> 12:09.339
I was... I was just upstairs,
and Ben doesn't even...

12:09.363 --> 12:11.065
I mean, he wants
nothing to do with me.

12:11.098 --> 12:12.442
You know, I was thinking
that we should...

12:12.466 --> 12:13.867
Josie. Josie. Just stop.

12:13.901 --> 12:15.936
Stop what?

12:15.970 --> 12:17.013
You know,
whenever you come into town,

12:17.037 --> 12:18.272
you see a problem,

12:18.305 --> 12:20.307
and you want to jump in,
and try to fix it,

12:20.341 --> 12:21.442
and try to make it go away.

12:21.475 --> 12:23.444
I just want to help.

12:23.477 --> 12:24.812
I know you do,

12:24.845 --> 12:26.847
but there's
no quick fix for this.

12:28.215 --> 12:30.784
I'm just gonna
miss them so much.

12:33.220 --> 12:35.022
Yeah. Me too.

12:43.464 --> 12:44.464
Thank you.

13:21.001 --> 13:22.136
Josie?

13:25.406 --> 13:27.509
Cooper.

13:27.542 --> 13:29.109
Hey.

13:29.143 --> 13:31.546
You know, I thought
I saw you at the church.

13:31.579 --> 13:34.481
You... You look...

13:34.516 --> 13:36.917
A little less handsome
than you remember?

13:38.385 --> 13:39.486
Yeah.

13:42.657 --> 13:43.957
Come on.

13:50.632 --> 13:52.567
You haven't changed a bit
since prom.

13:52.600 --> 13:54.234
Oh, I don't know
how I feel about that.

13:55.369 --> 13:56.403
You have.

13:56.437 --> 13:57.505
You look different.

13:59.239 --> 14:02.142
Oh. You better
choose your next words wisely.

14:02.176 --> 14:03.477
You look good.

14:03.511 --> 14:05.112
We all grew up.

14:07.682 --> 14:09.917
Did you come down from Atlanta
for this?

14:09.950 --> 14:12.086
No. I live... I live here now.

14:12.119 --> 14:13.296
Yeah, I moved back a while ago.

14:13.320 --> 14:14.388
Took over the farm.

14:14.421 --> 14:15.422
I didn't know that.

14:15.456 --> 14:17.324
Yeah. It was the right time.

14:17.358 --> 14:18.258
It's good to be home.

14:18.292 --> 14:19.993
Yeah.

14:21.228 --> 14:22.496
How are you doing?

14:23.964 --> 14:25.366
I'm so worried
about the kids, I...

14:25.399 --> 14:27.034
- Jo.
- I just don't...

14:27.067 --> 14:28.168
you know, I don't...

14:28.202 --> 14:29.242
- you know what we...
- Jo.

14:30.371 --> 14:32.005
How are you doing?

14:36.176 --> 14:37.945
I'm sorry. I'm not good.

14:37.978 --> 14:40.414
Yeah.

14:41.649 --> 14:44.118
I'm just gonna miss her so much.

14:44.151 --> 14:45.919
I just keep playing
that game in my head

14:45.953 --> 14:46.721
of "what if I had called her"

14:46.755 --> 14:48.422
right before
they got in the car?

14:48.455 --> 14:49.700
You know, what if
they hadn't been on the road?

14:49.724 --> 14:52.226
- Josie, you had nothing
to do with this.

14:52.259 --> 14:55.062
Ellie and Aaron... this is fate.

14:55.095 --> 14:59.199
Destiny,
I don't know what this is.

14:59.233 --> 15:01.301
But you're not
in the math, okay?

15:03.203 --> 15:05.038
Thank you.

15:08.976 --> 15:10.344
Can you excuse me for a sec?

15:10.377 --> 15:12.012
Of course. Go.

15:16.651 --> 15:17.651
Ben?

15:19.253 --> 15:21.188
I'm fine.

15:25.259 --> 15:27.261
Everything seems to be in order.

15:27.294 --> 15:29.363
Your daughter and her husband
were very organized.

15:29.396 --> 15:30.598
Thank you, Mr. Yates.

15:30.632 --> 15:32.700
So, are there any papers
we need to sign

15:32.734 --> 15:34.636
for legal guardianship
of the grandchildren?

15:34.669 --> 15:36.504
Well, about that...

15:36.538 --> 15:39.707
seems Mr. and Mrs. Gable threw
a bit of a curveball your way.

15:39.741 --> 15:42.176
What... What kind of curveball?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.645
It turns out, Mr. Wilder,

15:43.678 --> 15:46.346
you and your wife
are not the legal guardians.

15:48.550 --> 15:50.350
So, who is?

15:51.586 --> 15:53.020
You are, Josie.

15:54.188 --> 15:55.989
Ellie chose you.

15:56.023 --> 15:57.224
Me?

15:59.159 --> 16:01.529
W...

16:01.563 --> 16:03.397
Why me? I-I-I...

16:03.430 --> 16:05.165
I live in New York.

16:05.199 --> 16:06.577
I have a job
and an apartment and Tony,

16:06.601 --> 16:08.469
and I... I'm...

16:08.503 --> 16:10.070
No. There...
There must be some mistake.

16:10.103 --> 16:11.639
Josie, you can decline.

16:11.673 --> 16:13.383
Your mother and I
will take care of everything.

16:13.407 --> 16:14.709
Why would Ellie do this?

16:14.742 --> 16:16.410
It was an emotional decision.

16:16.443 --> 16:18.154
I'm sure Ellie never thought
it would actually happen.

16:18.178 --> 16:19.313
Well, nobody ever does, Dad.

16:21.114 --> 16:23.250
The kids'll move in with us.

16:23.283 --> 16:24.218
We'll convert the den.

16:24.251 --> 16:26.186
Oh, I don't know, Pete.

16:26.220 --> 16:28.121
Their lives have been
turned upside down.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.257
Then we'll move
into Ellie and Aaron's place,

16:30.290 --> 16:31.793
temporarily,

16:31.826 --> 16:33.604
and, Jeff, maybe you can
move in for a bit as well.

16:33.628 --> 16:34.796
Yeah. Whatever you need.

16:34.829 --> 16:36.172
You could help your mother
with the kids

16:36.196 --> 16:37.207
while I'm at the restaurant.

16:37.231 --> 16:39.132
My hours
at the start-up are flexible,

16:39.166 --> 16:41.134
so I can do after school, or...

16:41.168 --> 16:42.580
Great. That way the kids
can keep their routines...

16:42.604 --> 16:44.204
school, friends, basketball.

16:44.238 --> 16:45.238
I'm gonna stay.

16:46.373 --> 16:47.474
Josie...

16:47.509 --> 16:49.376
What? No.

16:49.409 --> 16:52.079
No. No, no, no.
You go back to New York...

16:52.112 --> 16:54.348
to your life,
to your boyfriend...

16:54.381 --> 16:56.149
your accounts. Don't worry.

16:56.183 --> 16:57.728
We'll see you in a month,
like we planned.

16:57.752 --> 16:59.621
No, Dad.

16:59.654 --> 17:02.322
If this is what Ellie wanted,
then there must be some reason.

17:02.356 --> 17:04.267
She thought I was the right one
to take care of the kids,

17:04.291 --> 17:07.394
so I... I'm gonna do it,
I'm gonna stay.

17:21.743 --> 17:22.744
Hello?

17:22.777 --> 17:25.479
Josie? You blew a fuse.

17:25.513 --> 17:27.447
What...? Whoa.

17:27.481 --> 17:29.483
Dad.

17:29.517 --> 17:30.652
What'd you plug in?

17:30.685 --> 17:31.786
Nothing.

17:31.819 --> 17:34.154
Just... just a hair dryer

17:34.187 --> 17:36.227
and a straightening iron
and a WaterPik, and it's...

17:37.124 --> 17:38.726
It's just a WaterPik.

17:40.662 --> 17:42.162
Hey, yeah, I'm gonna be late.

17:42.195 --> 17:43.798
My alarm didn't go off.

17:43.831 --> 17:45.700
We blew a fuse.

17:45.733 --> 17:48.335
Dad's outside trying
to fix it right now.

17:48.368 --> 17:51.471
Yeah. Yeah,
we figured out the source.

17:51.506 --> 17:52.507
Now?

17:52.540 --> 17:53.508
No!

17:53.541 --> 17:54.809
I'm really sorry, Jeff.

17:54.842 --> 17:56.310
- Now?
- No!

17:56.343 --> 17:57.387
I just didn't know
this old house

17:57.411 --> 17:58.378
couldn't handle my appliances.

17:58.412 --> 17:59.346
Well, what'd you plug in?

17:59.379 --> 18:00.748
A nuclear reactor?

18:00.782 --> 18:03.718
No. Like, a straightening iron,
and stuff.

18:03.751 --> 18:05.311
Look, I never have
this problem at home.

18:05.553 --> 18:06.554
Now?

18:06.588 --> 18:07.722
- Yes!
- Yeah!

18:07.755 --> 18:10.792
Well, you're not at home now,
are you?

18:10.825 --> 18:12.392
I gotta go.

18:12.426 --> 18:14.829
But I will see you later,
Einstein.

18:14.862 --> 18:16.831
Oh, you're hilarious.
Ha-larious!

18:18.432 --> 18:20.334
Here, Dad, I'll help you
with the French toast.

18:20.367 --> 18:21.845
- I've got it.
- You know what, honey?

18:21.869 --> 18:24.672
Why don't you bring this down?

18:24.706 --> 18:26.373
Dad, I'm sorry about the fuse.

18:26.406 --> 18:27.508
I didn't...

18:27.542 --> 18:28.710
No problem.

18:30.511 --> 18:31.722
I can call an electrician
to come and...

18:31.746 --> 18:33.781
I'll take care of it.

18:33.815 --> 18:35.917
No, Dad. I'm gonna
have to be on my own here

18:35.950 --> 18:37.819
at some point
with Ben and Delilah, right?

18:37.852 --> 18:39.052
Let's see how things play out.

18:40.420 --> 18:41.589
What does that mean?

18:41.623 --> 18:43.390
I'll go rustle up your brother.

18:43.423 --> 18:45.359
Ooh, French toast.

18:45.392 --> 18:47.327
Yeah. You have
basketball practice today?

18:47.361 --> 18:49.229
Mm-hmm. And Coach Cooper said

18:49.262 --> 18:50.507
that he might start me
if I work on my jump shot.

18:50.531 --> 18:53.901
Wait. Cooper is...
Cooper's your coach?

18:53.935 --> 18:54.869
Mm-hmm.
Do you guys know each other?

18:54.902 --> 18:56.738
Yeah. I knew him.

18:56.771 --> 18:57.739
Wow.

18:57.772 --> 19:00.240
We went to high school together.

19:00.273 --> 19:02.342
The truth is,
Cooper was her boyfriend.

19:02.376 --> 19:03.343
And there it is.

19:03.377 --> 19:05.278
You and Coach?

19:05.312 --> 19:06.614
Gross.

19:08.281 --> 19:11.251
He was actually very cute!

19:11.284 --> 19:12.730
Now, your Aunt Josie,
on the other hand,

19:12.754 --> 19:14.330
was going through a little bit
of an awkward stage.

19:14.354 --> 19:15.790
Oh, thank you so much, Mom.

19:17.692 --> 19:18.860
What about you?

19:18.893 --> 19:20.695
Do you have any boys
you have crushes on?

19:20.728 --> 19:22.897
Mom said I should wait
until eighth grade.

19:22.930 --> 19:25.232
Oh. Your mom is probably right.

19:25.265 --> 19:27.200
"Was."

19:27.234 --> 19:29.269
She was probably right.

19:30.972 --> 19:32.372
Sorry, Delilah. I didn't...

19:34.876 --> 19:36.243
What about your brother?

19:36.276 --> 19:38.613
Does he have any romances?
Any crushes?

19:38.646 --> 19:40.915
He likes Lily,
this girl on the upper team.

19:40.948 --> 19:42.684
Zip it, Delilah!

19:42.717 --> 19:45.318
Now, Ben, that is not very nice.

19:45.352 --> 19:46.554
Hey, Ben, guess what?

19:46.587 --> 19:48.656
Aunt Josie used to go out
with Cooper.

19:48.690 --> 19:50.357
Gross.

19:50.390 --> 19:51.726
Oh, so it's unanimous.

19:51.759 --> 19:53.460
I'm gross.

19:53.493 --> 19:54.862
This bus is leaving.

19:54.896 --> 19:55.906
Oh, I got it, Dad.
I'm gonna take 'em.

19:55.930 --> 19:57.297
I planned on it.

19:57.330 --> 19:58.742
No, it's on the way
to the restaurant.

19:58.766 --> 20:01.536
Okay, then
I'll pick them up after school.

20:01.569 --> 20:02.904
Jeff's got that covered.

20:02.937 --> 20:05.305
Dad, I want to help.

20:05.338 --> 20:06.306
Your mother and I
can handle it. Come on.

20:06.339 --> 20:07.909
Time's a-wastin'.

20:13.781 --> 20:15.550
Don't feel bad, Jo.

20:15.583 --> 20:17.484
You know,
people show they're hurting

20:17.518 --> 20:18.820
in different ways,

20:18.853 --> 20:21.556
and your dad does not do
vulnerable,

20:21.589 --> 20:25.358
so he comes across sometimes
as, I don't know, gruff.

20:25.392 --> 20:27.795
Yeah, but I feel like
he just doesn't want me around.

20:27.829 --> 20:29.396
Oh, of course, he does.

20:29.429 --> 20:30.732
More than you know.

20:30.765 --> 20:32.600
It's just that
when your dad's in pain,

20:32.633 --> 20:35.335
he needs to take control.

20:35.368 --> 20:38.305
He needs to turn to things
that he can count on.

20:38.338 --> 20:39.550
Yeah, which is why
I want to help.

20:39.574 --> 20:40.307
I mean, what does he think?

20:40.340 --> 20:41.709
I'm just gonna go
back to New York

20:41.743 --> 20:42.977
when things get hard?

20:43.010 --> 20:44.545
Mm. Can you blame him?

20:44.579 --> 20:45.980
What do you mean?

20:46.013 --> 20:47.949
You have always been
our go-getter.

20:47.982 --> 20:48.850
Ever since you were little,

20:48.883 --> 20:50.484
you would make
all these lists of things

20:50.518 --> 20:51.919
you wanted to accomplish,

20:51.953 --> 20:54.689
and we are very proud
that you have reached them all.

20:54.722 --> 20:56.562
Which is why I know
I can be the kids' guardian

20:56.591 --> 20:57.592
and do what Ellie wanted.

20:57.625 --> 20:59.727
But is it what you want to do?

20:59.761 --> 21:03.497
Because being the kids' guardian
isn't a part-time job.

21:03.531 --> 21:05.298
I know.

21:05.332 --> 21:06.968
Okay.

21:07.001 --> 21:07.935
Josie Wilder!

21:07.969 --> 21:10.538
Nate! Hey!

21:10.571 --> 21:12.039
Look at you, in a coat and tie.

21:12.073 --> 21:13.908
Comes with the job.

21:13.941 --> 21:14.952
He's the kids' pediatrician.

21:14.976 --> 21:16.343
Aw.

21:16.376 --> 21:17.521
I was hoping
you followed your dream

21:17.545 --> 21:18.579
of becoming a magician.

21:18.613 --> 21:20.581
Oh, well, I think you'll find

21:20.615 --> 21:23.651
I've still got some tricks
up the proverbial sleeve.

21:23.684 --> 21:25.887
Still "Nate the Great."

21:27.688 --> 21:28.956
I also just want to say

21:28.990 --> 21:31.526
that I'm sorry for your loss,
both of you.

21:31.559 --> 21:32.860
Thank you.

21:32.894 --> 21:34.327
That is very sweet of you, Nate.

21:34.361 --> 21:35.630
Yeah. It's good to see you.

21:35.663 --> 21:38.398
Yeah. You too, Josie.

21:38.431 --> 21:40.868
Looks like Josie Wilder
has a thing for my guys.

21:40.902 --> 21:42.937
Oh, Molly Mills.

21:42.970 --> 21:44.471
First, you steal Cooper
junior year,

21:44.505 --> 21:47.008
now you have your arms
wrapped around Nate.

21:47.041 --> 21:48.009
Jo wasn't trying
to steal me, Moll.

21:48.042 --> 21:49.677
She's just kidding.

21:49.710 --> 21:50.878
T-Tell him you're kidding.

21:50.912 --> 21:52.445
Oh, of course, I am.

21:52.479 --> 21:54.649
Besides, I locked this guy down
two years ago,

21:54.682 --> 21:55.993
and now
we're practically engaged.

21:56.017 --> 21:57.350
Right, Nate?

21:57.384 --> 21:58.586
Excuse me.

21:58.619 --> 22:01.488
You guys are...
are together now?

22:01.522 --> 22:02.957
That's amazing...
and surprising!

22:02.990 --> 22:04.430
You barely talked
during high school.

22:04.457 --> 22:06.527
A lot has happened
since you left New Hope.

22:06.561 --> 22:08.863
Yeah, it has.

22:08.896 --> 22:12.533
Yeah. Uh, anyway, Jo,
how long are you in town?

22:12.567 --> 22:15.069
Uh...

22:15.102 --> 22:17.605
Ellie and Aaron actually
made me the kids' guardian.

22:17.638 --> 22:19.372
You?

22:19.406 --> 22:20.541
Wow.

22:20.575 --> 22:22.375
That's... a lot.

22:22.409 --> 22:24.477
Yeah, it is.

22:24.512 --> 22:26.814
You know, we're working it out.
We're figuring it out.

22:26.848 --> 22:28.625
I know you're probably
not much of a kid person, so.

22:28.649 --> 22:29.917
What?

22:29.951 --> 22:31.384
Ahem.

22:31.418 --> 22:34.689
Yeah, I've only got
an hour for lunch, Moll.

22:34.722 --> 22:36.057
It was really good
to see you, Jo.

22:36.090 --> 22:36.924
Good to see you too.

22:36.958 --> 22:38.001
Maybe I'll see you guys
around town.

22:38.025 --> 22:39.359
- Bye.
- Bye.

22:41.195 --> 22:43.931
It's nice to know some things,
like Molly, never change.

22:43.965 --> 22:45.398
Mm-hmm.

22:45.432 --> 22:48.035
Well, that was Delilah.

22:48.069 --> 22:51.005
She's finally back at school,
and she forgot her lunch.

22:51.038 --> 22:52.678
- Just like Ellie.
- Just like her mother.

22:56.544 --> 22:58.522
I'm... I'll, uh... I'm gonna
go run to the school and...

22:58.546 --> 22:59.981
No, Mom. I'll do it.

23:00.014 --> 23:01.481
Let me do it.

23:01.515 --> 23:03.618
I'll grab something
and I'll bring it to her.

23:03.651 --> 23:04.795
I'm just gonna
give your dad a call,

23:04.819 --> 23:06.888
just in case he does...

23:09.757 --> 23:12.193
This is...

23:12.226 --> 23:13.828
This was Ellie's phone.

23:13.861 --> 23:14.862
It was, um...

23:14.896 --> 23:17.464
It was in the car.

23:17.497 --> 23:19.700
I don't know what to do with it.

23:19.734 --> 23:23.137
It just has all of her playlists
and all of her pictures.

23:26.841 --> 23:28.175
Here.

23:52.499 --> 23:54.568
<i>This is Tony.
You know what to do.</i>

23:54.602 --> 23:56.837
Hey. I'm sorry
we keep missing each other.

23:56.871 --> 23:58.205
You're probably at work.

23:58.239 --> 23:59.907
Listen.

23:59.941 --> 24:02.143
I don't know exactly when
I'm coming back to New York.

24:02.176 --> 24:03.476
Things are...

24:03.511 --> 24:05.513
I-I... I just need to be here,

24:05.546 --> 24:07.915
so, uh,
give me a call when you can.

24:07.949 --> 24:09.850
We should talk.

24:13.554 --> 24:14.789
Yeah, Wednesday sounds good.

24:14.822 --> 24:16.099
I think I have practice
on Thursdays,

24:16.123 --> 24:17.534
so I don't know
if I can make Thursday.

24:17.558 --> 24:18.491
See you, guys.

24:18.526 --> 24:19.660
Aunt Josie?

24:19.694 --> 24:20.928
You forgot something.

24:20.962 --> 24:22.196
You got my lunch?

24:22.229 --> 24:23.531
Of course, kiddo.

24:23.564 --> 24:24.899
Door-to-door service
with a smile.

24:24.932 --> 24:26.233
Thanks, Aunt Josie.

24:26.267 --> 24:28.636
Of course.

24:28.669 --> 24:29.637
I've got to get back to class.

24:29.670 --> 24:31.005
Have a good day, okay?

24:31.038 --> 24:32.773
And I'll pick
you and Ben up at 4:00.

24:32.807 --> 24:33.807
Okay. Thanks, Aunt Josie.

24:55.129 --> 24:57.832
Still trying to win that game
against High Point?

24:57.865 --> 24:59.834
That was a very long time ago.

24:59.867 --> 25:01.602
I'm totally over that.

25:01.635 --> 25:03.237
Even though
I work in the same gym,

25:03.270 --> 25:06.707
stare at the same net
every single day of my life.

25:06.741 --> 25:07.675
Yeah, it's killing me.

25:07.708 --> 25:08.909
Aw.

25:08.943 --> 25:10.153
I was just
bringing Delilah her lunch.

25:10.177 --> 25:11.579
That's very nice.

25:12.947 --> 25:14.982
Word is you're staying in town
for a while.

25:15.016 --> 25:16.550
"Word" meaning Molly?

25:16.584 --> 25:17.885
Molly. Yeah.

25:17.918 --> 25:18.996
Well, she hasn't changed a bit.

25:19.020 --> 25:21.022
No, not one bit.

25:21.055 --> 25:23.157
There really are
no secrets in this town.

25:23.190 --> 25:24.225
Not a one.

25:24.258 --> 25:25.793
Huh.

25:27.695 --> 25:29.764
So how are things?

25:29.797 --> 25:31.899
We're trying
to figure things out, you know.

25:31.932 --> 25:34.635
I just... I just know I want
to do what's best for the kids.

25:34.668 --> 25:35.970
- Mm.
- And they need me here.

25:36.003 --> 25:38.539
It's nice to have you back home.

25:40.775 --> 25:41.942
It's good to see you.

25:44.945 --> 25:46.113
I gotta go.

25:46.147 --> 25:47.824
I got a... I got a meeting
back at the house.

25:47.848 --> 25:50.885
Yeah, I got a meeting, too.
It's just with short people.

25:57.792 --> 25:59.060
Better work on that shot

25:59.093 --> 26:00.795
if we're ever
gonna beat High Point.

26:02.196 --> 26:04.098
Ouch.

26:06.667 --> 26:08.202
Who invited you guys?

26:08.235 --> 26:10.137
Can't you see I'm busy?

26:10.171 --> 26:11.572
You guys grab the balls.

26:15.976 --> 26:17.054
<i>The color palette on the label

26:17.078 --> 26:19.213
<i>the water's European heritage...</i>

26:19.246 --> 26:23.317
<i>the clean, cool azure blue

26:23.350 --> 26:25.119
<i>VodaSpring.</i>

26:27.321 --> 26:28.656
Ah, brilliant.

26:28.689 --> 26:29.990
It is perfection.

26:30.024 --> 26:31.092
<i>Thank you, Victor.</i>

26:31.125 --> 26:33.794
<i>What's the price point?</i>

26:33.828 --> 26:36.030
Uh, my team's research
suggests at least a 20% mark-up.

26:36.063 --> 26:37.331
The water market

26:37.364 --> 26:38.766
<i>is saturated...</i>

26:40.134 --> 26:42.636
<i>with domestic and Nordic brands,</i>

26:42.670 --> 26:44.772
<i>but the Czech branding
is an untapped resource.</i>

26:44.805 --> 26:46.974
<i>I like it. You're a keeper.</i>

26:47.007 --> 26:48.409
<i>Great.</i>

26:48.442 --> 26:50.911
<i>Tell me more
about the TV campaign.</i>

26:50.945 --> 26:52.913
Yes, of course.

26:52.947 --> 26:55.049
The, uh... the TV campaign.

26:55.082 --> 26:56.951
Um... right.

26:56.984 --> 26:58.652
Let's run it!

26:58.686 --> 27:01.021
Stay busy! Stay fast! Eyes up!

27:01.055 --> 27:02.056
Take your time, Delilah.

27:02.089 --> 27:03.924
Shoot it up!

27:04.992 --> 27:06.260
Oh, so close!

27:06.293 --> 27:07.628
That's practice.

27:10.231 --> 27:12.700
Delilah, come here.

27:12.733 --> 27:13.893
I want to ask you a question.

27:15.169 --> 27:17.204
You know someone
named Hakeem Olajuwon?

27:17.238 --> 27:19.106
- No.
- I'm gonna spell it for you

27:19.140 --> 27:21.275
and you're gonna look it up
on YouTubes, all right?

27:21.308 --> 27:23.144
He's got the best footwork
in the game.

27:23.177 --> 27:25.021
I think it'll help you out.
Hey, Ben, you got five minutes?

27:25.045 --> 27:26.347
- Sure.
- My man.

27:26.380 --> 27:28.020
I'm gonna show you a drop step.
Come here.

27:31.252 --> 27:33.053
- Hi, Lily.
- Hey.

27:36.323 --> 27:38.292
Sorry about your parents.

27:39.860 --> 27:41.395
Yep.

27:45.299 --> 27:47.835
Well, I've got practice, so...

27:47.868 --> 27:49.270
I'll see you around.

27:49.303 --> 27:52.940
Wait. Um, my band is...

27:52.973 --> 27:55.209
I mean, this band I'm in,
it's...

27:55.242 --> 27:57.778
I mean, we're playing
tomorrow night,

27:57.811 --> 28:00.080
here, a-at the gym,
so if you want to come...

28:00.114 --> 28:01.182
or not...

28:01.215 --> 28:02.016
I mean, you don't have to.

28:02.049 --> 28:03.184
Cool.

28:03.217 --> 28:05.853
I didn't know your band
was playing,

28:05.886 --> 28:06.954
but I'm totally coming.

28:06.987 --> 28:08.322
Cool.

28:12.293 --> 28:13.861
"Cool"?

28:13.894 --> 28:16.230
Was that sort of loser-ish?

28:16.263 --> 28:19.266
Well, I mean, for anybody else?
Totally.

28:19.300 --> 28:20.868
But for you?

28:20.901 --> 28:21.902
It was pure genius.

28:21.936 --> 28:23.470
Come on.

28:23.505 --> 28:24.805
Aunt Josie's
picking us up today.

28:26.473 --> 28:28.242
She's almost a half-hour late.

28:28.275 --> 28:29.977
Give her more time.

28:30.010 --> 28:31.922
Aunt Josie said that she wanted
to pick us up, and that...

28:31.946 --> 28:32.956
And she forgot
or got too busy or...

28:32.980 --> 28:34.014
She'll come!

28:34.048 --> 28:36.817
I'm calling Grandma.

28:36.850 --> 28:39.220
<i>The spot ends with the mythical
double-tailed lion,</i>

28:39.253 --> 28:41.088
<i>the Czech Republic's
national animal,</i>

28:41.121 --> 28:42.957
<i>posed in front of
a bed of roses.</i>

28:42.990 --> 28:44.124
Great job, Josie.

28:44.158 --> 28:45.292
So thank you for...

28:45.326 --> 28:47.061
Let's talk rollout.

28:47.094 --> 28:49.330
<i>Oh, that is, if your hotshot VP</i>

28:49.363 --> 28:50.831
- can spare the time.
- Mm-hmm.

28:50.864 --> 28:52.399
I... I'm sorry.
I actually can't.

28:52.433 --> 28:54.168
Uh, Josie, we've...

28:54.201 --> 28:55.212
<i>You know what? I'm already late</i>

28:55.236 --> 28:56.413
to pick up my niece and nephew.

28:56.437 --> 28:58.372
I'm so sorry,
but I'll have to reschedule.

29:05.045 --> 29:06.347
So, Grandpa,

29:06.380 --> 29:08.020
people can just place
their orders online,

29:08.048 --> 29:09.950
and then someone else
picks the food up

29:09.984 --> 29:11.285
and delivers it.

29:11.318 --> 29:12.462
All you have to do
is register the restaurant.

29:12.486 --> 29:13.988
This has always been a place

29:14.021 --> 29:16.490
where people get together,
say hello over a meal,

29:16.524 --> 29:17.858
and that's how
it's going to stay.

29:17.891 --> 29:19.561
Thank goodness. I'm so sorry.

29:19.594 --> 29:20.971
I went to the school.
I must've just missed you.

29:20.995 --> 29:22.496
It's okay, honey.

29:22.530 --> 29:24.431
I'm so sorry.

29:24.465 --> 29:26.066
Did you forget us?

29:26.100 --> 29:27.210
No! No, no, no. I was just
stuck on a call, and...

29:27.234 --> 29:29.003
You got too busy.

29:29.036 --> 29:32.206
Josie, if you can't
handle the responsibility...

29:32.239 --> 29:33.517
No, Dad. I was just on with
a really demanding client

29:33.541 --> 29:34.908
from the city.

29:34.942 --> 29:36.086
But I jumped off
before it was even over...

29:36.110 --> 29:37.011
You say "the city"
like you think.

29:37.044 --> 29:38.912
New York is the only place
that matters.

29:38.946 --> 29:40.546
- Okay, that's enough.
- Ben, cut it out.

29:41.849 --> 29:43.417
Everyone ready to go?

29:51.859 --> 29:53.494
That went... great.

29:53.528 --> 29:55.863
Look. I do not want you
to beat yourself up

29:55.896 --> 29:57.532
about this, all right?

29:57.565 --> 30:00.602
I was late for school pick-up
more times than I can count.

30:00.635 --> 30:03.937
It's just that Dad finally
lets me do something,

30:03.971 --> 30:05.105
and I screw it up.

30:05.139 --> 30:06.440
No.

30:06.473 --> 30:08.242
The minute
you stop making mistakes

30:08.275 --> 30:10.277
is when you stop trying.

30:10.311 --> 30:12.146
Kind of like this.

30:12.179 --> 30:14.516
You stopped trying.
You're wearing pajama bottoms.

30:14.549 --> 30:16.383
What? The meetings are on video.

30:16.417 --> 30:17.497
They only see from here up.

30:20.522 --> 30:23.891
Ugh. What was Ellie thinking,
making me their guardian?

30:23.924 --> 30:25.627
We are gonna figure that out
together,

30:25.660 --> 30:27.595
as a family.

30:27.629 --> 30:30.264
In the meantime,
let's get the kids home,

30:30.297 --> 30:32.299
and you in grown-up clothes.

30:32.333 --> 30:34.536
Mm-hmm.

31:17.344 --> 31:18.345
Oh, no!

31:18.379 --> 31:20.381
Oh, no! Uh...

31:20.414 --> 31:22.116
Whoa, whoa.
What the heck are you doing?

31:22.149 --> 31:23.661
Uh, making breakfast.
What does it look like?

31:23.685 --> 31:25.352
Burning down the house.

31:27.054 --> 31:29.557
Hey. Hey, sorry, man.
I got to call you back.

31:29.591 --> 31:31.458
I'm putting out
a few fires over here.

31:31.492 --> 31:33.036
So, yeah, why don't you just
run the numbers

31:33.060 --> 31:35.129
and see if it makes sense?
Okay. 'Kay, bye.

31:35.162 --> 31:36.564
Thank you.

31:36.598 --> 31:38.666
Yeah, of course, but what,
you don't do

31:38.700 --> 31:40.367
a lot of cooking
up there in New York?

31:40.401 --> 31:41.636
No. I'm more of

31:41.669 --> 31:44.071
a takeout/make-a-reservation
type of a gal.

31:44.104 --> 31:45.507
Was that about work?

31:45.540 --> 31:46.708
Yeah, it was.

31:46.741 --> 31:49.009
What? Were you listening
to my phone call?

31:49.042 --> 31:50.387
Listen, if you need
help with anything,

31:50.411 --> 31:53.013
I mean, I've advised
a few start-ups.

31:53.046 --> 31:55.115
No, we're good.
Thank you, honestly.

31:55.149 --> 31:57.951
Besides, if anyone could use
some help around here,

31:57.985 --> 31:59.219
it's you.

31:59.253 --> 32:00.387
Hey.

32:00.421 --> 32:01.388
I love you, Jojo.

32:01.422 --> 32:02.657
Love you, too.

32:04.726 --> 32:06.460
All right. Let's...
try this again.

32:09.496 --> 32:12.266
Uh, did we all say thank you
to Aunt Josie

32:12.299 --> 32:13.500
for making breakfast?

32:13.535 --> 32:14.702
- Thanks.
- Thank you.

32:14.736 --> 32:16.470
Jeff said

32:16.504 --> 32:17.648
he almost had to call
the fire department

32:17.672 --> 32:18.606
this morning.

32:18.640 --> 32:20.107
Mm.

32:20.140 --> 32:21.619
Yeah, that seems to be
my specialty, Dad...

32:21.643 --> 32:24.646
four-alarm eggs and bacon.

32:24.679 --> 32:27.114
So, Ben, what time
is the concert tonight?

32:27.147 --> 32:28.616
You're not all coming.

32:28.650 --> 32:30.618
I mean, yeah, of course.

32:30.652 --> 32:32.453
Your mom and dad always
went to your concerts.

32:32.486 --> 32:35.389
They're not here anymore.

32:35.422 --> 32:37.535
Maybe Ben just wants to be
alone with his new girlfriend.

32:37.559 --> 32:39.426
Don't be such a jerk!

32:39.460 --> 32:41.161
Hey, no name-calling!

32:42.597 --> 32:44.198
Come on, Delilah.

32:44.231 --> 32:45.676
Your mom didn't raise you
to tease him like that.

32:45.700 --> 32:46.668
Go apologize.

32:46.701 --> 32:47.702
No.

32:47.735 --> 32:49.403
Delilah!

32:49.436 --> 32:52.239
She's not my mom!
She's not anyone's mom!

32:56.644 --> 32:58.278
Excuse me.

33:05.419 --> 33:08.188
Cooper, you have no idea
how happy I am you just called.

33:08.222 --> 33:09.767
Wish all my friends would
answer the phone like that.

33:09.791 --> 33:11.358
<i>You okay?</i>

33:11.391 --> 33:13.460
Yeah. Every...
everything's fine.

33:13.494 --> 33:15.171
Your words say "fine,"
but your tone says "lousy."

33:15.195 --> 33:16.196
What's wrong?

33:16.230 --> 33:17.665
Oh, I don't know.

33:17.699 --> 33:21.603
I just burned breakfast again,
I upset both of the kids,

33:21.636 --> 33:23.805
I blew out I don't know
how many fuses in the house,

33:23.838 --> 33:26.182
and I walked out on a meeting
with a really important client.

33:26.206 --> 33:27.407
So you're having a good day.

33:27.441 --> 33:29.476
<i>Yeah, no, things are great.
Going just great.</i>

33:29.511 --> 33:31.144
Let me guess.

33:31.178 --> 33:32.780
You're rubbing your temple

33:32.814 --> 33:34.582
<i>in tiny little circles
right about now.</i>

33:34.616 --> 33:35.717
No.

33:35.750 --> 33:37.184
Maybe.

33:37.217 --> 33:38.586
How did you know that?

33:38.620 --> 33:40.063
That's what you do
when you're stressed.

33:40.087 --> 33:41.556
It's your thing.

33:41.589 --> 33:43.090
I don't have a thing.

33:43.123 --> 33:44.592
Oh, you certainly do
have a thing.

33:44.626 --> 33:46.426
Everybody's got a thing.

33:48.161 --> 33:50.230
<i>My two cents,
for what it's worth...</i>

33:50.264 --> 33:54.101
which is probably
about two cents...

33:54.134 --> 33:56.771
you're going through
a lot right now,

33:56.804 --> 33:58.673
by anyone's standards,

33:58.706 --> 34:01.609
and you also just got back.

34:01.643 --> 34:03.511
Maybe you cut yourself a break.

34:03.545 --> 34:05.680
I wish I knew how.

34:05.713 --> 34:07.582
I don't know
what I'm doing, Cooper.

34:07.615 --> 34:10.350
I feel like I'm messing up
as a parent

34:10.384 --> 34:11.686
and a sister
and a daughter here,

34:11.719 --> 34:13.420
and I'm dropping the ball

34:13.453 --> 34:15.322
on my fake European water
account in New York.

34:15.355 --> 34:17.291
"Fake European water"?

34:17.324 --> 34:20.227
There's three words you don't
hear together every day.

34:20.260 --> 34:22.597
I know. Tell me about it.

34:22.630 --> 34:24.566
<i>Oh, you called me,
and I just piled on.</i>

34:24.599 --> 34:26.133
I'm sorry.

34:26.166 --> 34:27.735
What'd you want to talk about?

34:27.769 --> 34:30.337
Ben's got a concert tonight.
Are you going?

34:30.370 --> 34:32.406
Well, Ben doesn't
actually want me there,

34:32.439 --> 34:34.474
but he also doesn't
have a choice,

34:34.509 --> 34:36.410
so, yeah, I'm going.

34:36.443 --> 34:38.178
Are you?

34:38.211 --> 34:39.614
Yes, ma'am, I am.

34:41.315 --> 34:42.750
Save a dance for an old friend?

34:42.784 --> 34:45.118
I'll save you two.

34:45.152 --> 34:46.788
I like that.

34:49.657 --> 34:51.325
Hmph.

34:51.358 --> 34:53.895
Well, she's trying, Pete.

34:53.928 --> 34:56.296
This is all so new to her,

34:56.330 --> 34:58.700
so if she's not as good
with the kids as Ellie was,

34:58.733 --> 35:01.168
we just need to give her time.

35:01.201 --> 35:03.705
I give her
another month tops, Kate.

35:03.738 --> 35:07.307
Then she's back to New York,
living the life she wants.

35:29.229 --> 35:30.874
So, you're going from concerts
at Madison Square Garden

35:30.898 --> 35:32.432
to this.

35:32.466 --> 35:33.868
Pretty different, huh?

35:33.901 --> 35:35.570
Yeah. I mean,
the Garden's great,

35:35.603 --> 35:37.471
but this has its own charm,

35:37.505 --> 35:39.439
and the floors are less sticky.

35:39.473 --> 35:40.675
This reminds me of the band

35:40.708 --> 35:42.251
Cooper and I had
back in the 11th grade.

35:42.275 --> 35:45.747
I'm sorry,
but you guys were awful.

35:45.780 --> 35:47.220
- Did you ever hear us?
- Shockingly,

35:47.247 --> 35:48.358
I'd have to agree with Josie.

35:48.382 --> 35:49.884
You were awful.

35:49.917 --> 35:51.686
You did hear us.

35:55.590 --> 35:58.458
So what's it like for you,
being a mom?

35:58.492 --> 36:00.862
Must be so hard.

36:00.895 --> 36:04.398
Well, I mean,
no one can replace their mom,

36:04.431 --> 36:06.500
but, uh, I'm their aunt
and their guardian,

36:06.534 --> 36:08.612
and you know what, Molly?
I think I'm pretty good at it.

36:08.636 --> 36:10.203
Yeah.

36:10.237 --> 36:11.606
Hey, Delilah.

36:11.639 --> 36:13.206
Hey, come hang out with us.

36:13.240 --> 36:15.510
For the record, Aunt Josie,
you're the worst!

36:17.477 --> 36:20.247
You're right.
I see you're really good at it.

36:21.481 --> 36:23.316
Excuse me.

36:36.864 --> 36:38.866
What's going on, kiddo?

36:40.300 --> 36:41.869
I don't know why I said that.

36:43.538 --> 36:45.606
Look, I'm... I'm trying my best,

36:45.640 --> 36:48.576
and I'm probably gonna
make a lot of mistakes,

36:48.609 --> 36:50.343
but you can talk to me
about anything.

36:52.412 --> 36:53.915
It's just...

36:53.948 --> 36:57.451
when you brought up my mom
at breakfast,

36:57.484 --> 37:00.220
I got mad or something.

37:01.455 --> 37:03.658
Yeah. I get it.

37:03.691 --> 37:05.560
When people bring up my sister,

37:05.593 --> 37:07.595
even when
they're trying to be nice,

37:07.628 --> 37:10.363
I get kind of
"mad or something" too.

37:12.332 --> 37:14.234
When is that going away?

37:15.570 --> 37:16.971
I don't know.

37:17.004 --> 37:18.338
Probably sooner than we think.

37:19.907 --> 37:22.710
But missing Mom and Dad...

37:22.744 --> 37:24.746
when is that going away?

37:25.847 --> 37:26.847
Hopefully never.

37:28.683 --> 37:32.854
I'll never stop missing
my sister or your dad...

37:32.887 --> 37:34.756
and I think it's gonna hurt
for a long time.

37:36.090 --> 37:37.692
But you know what?

37:37.725 --> 37:40.061
I really think the memories
that make us cry now,

37:40.094 --> 37:43.430
I think, one day...

37:43.463 --> 37:46.534
I think, one day,
they're gonna make you smile

37:46.567 --> 37:48.368
because you got to make
those memories

37:48.401 --> 37:49.871
with your mom and dad, Delilah.

37:49.904 --> 37:51.371
Those are yours,

37:51.404 --> 37:53.508
and they are always
gonna be with you.

37:55.042 --> 37:57.444
I don't want
to smile about it now.

37:57.477 --> 37:59.080
And you don't have to.

37:59.113 --> 38:01.616
You don't have to.

38:01.649 --> 38:05.352
You feel exactly
what you want to feel.

38:05.385 --> 38:06.821
And I am always here for you.

38:09.489 --> 38:11.826
I'm sorry
I called you the worst.

38:11.859 --> 38:13.060
It's not your fault

38:13.094 --> 38:14.996
you haven't figured out
how to be a mom yet.

38:15.029 --> 38:16.731
I'm trying.

38:16.764 --> 38:18.398
I know.

38:18.431 --> 38:20.802
You're actually
kinda okay at it.

38:22.469 --> 38:24.939
You want to go back
and listen to Ben's band now?

38:24.972 --> 38:26.532
Yeah. I mean,
that's why we came, right?

38:28.109 --> 38:29.610
Come here.

38:29.644 --> 38:31.344
Aw.

38:31.378 --> 38:32.445
It's gonna be okay.

38:34.582 --> 38:35.850
Let's go have some fun.

38:35.883 --> 38:38.686
Okay.

38:44.025 --> 38:46.794
Whoo! Yeah!

38:46.828 --> 38:48.129
Way to go! Whoo!

38:50.832 --> 38:54.068
Well, aren't you just
the spittin' image of lovely.

38:54.101 --> 38:55.903
- Aw.
- And the hair...

38:55.937 --> 38:57.705
tch!

38:57.738 --> 38:59.807
My dad calls it "low voltage."

38:59.841 --> 39:01.441
I prefer to call it
"au naturel."

39:05.478 --> 39:07.380
They're playing our song.

39:07.414 --> 39:09.150
Yes, they are.

39:09.183 --> 39:11.384
Okay, I may have
put in a request.

39:13.087 --> 39:14.832
Are we junior high dancing,
or adult dancing?

39:14.856 --> 39:16.489
- Junior high.
- Oh, good choice.

39:16.524 --> 39:18.092
Good choice.

39:18.125 --> 39:19.459
Uh, a little low on the hands.

39:19.492 --> 39:20.427
- Oh. Yes, ma'am.
- Thank you, sir.

39:20.460 --> 39:21.460
Yeah, I apologize.

39:22.697 --> 39:24.497
They played this

39:24.532 --> 39:26.667
right after they crowned you
Prom King.

39:26.701 --> 39:28.501
And you were Queen.

39:28.536 --> 39:30.470
Oh, I was just
riding your coat tails.

39:30.504 --> 39:32.907
You don't believe that
for one second.

39:34.675 --> 39:38.512
It does take me back to prom,
being here, doesn't it?

39:38.546 --> 39:40.882
Yeah. Ugh, but now
we're the chaperones.

39:40.915 --> 39:46.486
Wow. Way to just kill the vibe,
Jo, come on.

39:46.520 --> 39:47.655
Hmm.

39:48.856 --> 39:50.423
What?

39:50.457 --> 39:52.026
Oh, nothing.

39:52.059 --> 39:53.961
Oh, come on.
Your words say "nothing,"

39:53.995 --> 39:56.964
but your tone says,
"I got a lot on my mind."

39:56.998 --> 39:57.865
Okay. You think you're slick.

39:57.899 --> 39:59.700
This isn't my first rodeo.
What is it?

39:59.734 --> 40:01.135
What is it? What is it?

40:01.168 --> 40:02.837
I was thinking about prom night,

40:02.870 --> 40:06.007
the future that I saw for, uh...
for you and I.

40:06.040 --> 40:07.842
That's what
I was thinking about.

40:07.875 --> 40:09.577
Ah, we were so young.

40:09.610 --> 40:11.045
We were...

40:11.078 --> 40:12.113
- Yeah.
- So young.

40:12.146 --> 40:13.781
Yeah, we were young.

40:13.814 --> 40:15.125
That's the thing
about being young, though.

40:15.149 --> 40:16.550
You don't feel young.

40:16.584 --> 40:18.519
Hmm. Yeah.

40:19.654 --> 40:20.654
I've missed you.

40:23.024 --> 40:25.693
I mean, if you'd just come
to NYU with me, like I wanted...

40:25.726 --> 40:27.494
Oh, wow. We really are
back in high school.

40:27.528 --> 40:28.696
- Yeah.
- Help! Help!

40:33.668 --> 40:35.202
I do think about
what would've happened

40:35.236 --> 40:36.480
if maybe we didn't go
our separate ways.

40:36.504 --> 40:37.939
You think about that?

40:46.948 --> 40:49.517
Busted for dancing too close.

40:49.550 --> 40:51.118
Some things never change, Jo.

40:54.221 --> 40:56.657
I'm gonna get us some soda.
Stay here, okay?

41:09.870 --> 41:11.138
Ohh.

41:11.172 --> 41:13.107
Ben.

41:21.682 --> 41:24.652
You want some help?

41:24.685 --> 41:26.721
I'll wash, you dry.

41:31.993 --> 41:33.828
How was your day?

41:33.861 --> 41:37.198
I just want to apologize

41:37.231 --> 41:40.634
for that fire alarm comment
I made this morning.

41:40.668 --> 41:42.636
It was inconsiderate.

41:44.038 --> 41:45.940
That's okay.
I know this is hard on you.

41:45.973 --> 41:48.042
Probably much harder on you,

41:48.075 --> 41:51.679
having to uproot your life
at the drop of a hat

41:51.712 --> 41:53.014
to come back here

41:53.047 --> 41:55.116
to a place you spent
your whole life

41:55.149 --> 41:56.717
trying to get away from.

41:56.751 --> 41:57.861
Dad, that's not exactly true.

41:57.885 --> 42:00.121
You wanted to tackle the world.

42:00.154 --> 42:03.224
And I suppose...

42:03.257 --> 42:06.193
if I'm being honest,

42:06.227 --> 42:08.529
it hurt a little
when you left for New York.

42:10.031 --> 42:12.166
I didn't leave you. I just...

42:12.199 --> 42:15.269
You had to find your own life.
I get it.

42:15.302 --> 42:17.605
And if I haven't said it enough,

42:17.638 --> 42:19.807
I'm amazed at what you've done.

42:22.977 --> 42:25.179
Thank you.

42:25.212 --> 42:27.982
Which is why you don't
have to keep this up.

42:28.015 --> 42:29.683
What are you saying?

42:31.085 --> 42:33.888
Just that...

42:33.921 --> 42:36.257
maybe you're not the same girl
that Ellie thought you were.

42:36.290 --> 42:39.293
Maybe your sister was wrong.

42:39.326 --> 42:43.364
So if this isn't for you,
that's okay.

42:43.397 --> 42:45.933
Your mom and I can take care
of Ben and Delilah,

42:45.966 --> 42:48.002
and they'll understand.

42:48.035 --> 42:51.205
It's okay to go home, Jojo.

42:52.740 --> 42:54.041
Do you want me to leave?

42:56.410 --> 42:58.579
Just... think it over.

43:00.781 --> 43:01.949
Goodnight, kiddo.

43:01.982 --> 43:03.684
I love you.

43:14.995 --> 43:16.931
Oh, VodaSpring...

43:16.964 --> 43:19.266
VodaSpring, VodaSpring,
VodaSpring.

43:35.783 --> 43:36.783
She kept it.

43:38.185 --> 43:40.754
Oh.

43:42.289 --> 43:44.225
Jo? Can you come help me
in the kitchen, please?

43:44.258 --> 43:45.302
Yeah. I'll be there
in just a sec.

43:45.326 --> 43:46.760
Okay.

43:49.296 --> 43:51.832
So the kids have a bake sale
at school tomorrow,

43:51.866 --> 43:53.267
and I promised I'd help them,

43:53.300 --> 43:55.078
and now your father needs me
at the restaurant

43:55.102 --> 43:56.704
to help cover Saturday rush.

43:56.737 --> 43:58.172
It'll be fun.

43:58.205 --> 43:59.349
It'll be good for me to spend
some quality time

43:59.373 --> 44:00.908
with Ben and Delilah.

44:00.941 --> 44:02.276
I don't know why, but I just...

44:02.309 --> 44:04.712
I feel like
Ben's always irritated with me.

44:04.745 --> 44:06.089
Well, aside from
all that's happened,

44:06.113 --> 44:07.448
he is still a teenaged boy.

44:07.481 --> 44:09.083
I mean, your brother,

44:09.116 --> 44:11.285
he would be irritable
from the moment I woke him up

44:11.318 --> 44:12.786
until the minute he was grounded

44:12.820 --> 44:14.054
for coming in past curfew.

44:15.789 --> 44:17.992
I don't know, Mom.
I just... I feel for Ben.

44:18.025 --> 44:19.202
I mean, first,
he loses his parents,

44:19.226 --> 44:21.061
and now... and now
he's heartbroken

44:21.095 --> 44:22.463
over this girl, Lily.

44:22.496 --> 44:23.874
Do you know she was at the dance
with another boy?

44:23.898 --> 44:26.400
And he saw them, together, and...

44:26.433 --> 44:27.768
I mean, who does
she think she is?

44:27.801 --> 44:29.236
There is no one better than Ben.

44:29.270 --> 44:32.039
See? You are finding your way.

44:38.746 --> 44:40.814
All right. So what
are we raising money for?

44:40.848 --> 44:42.716
My basketball team.

44:42.750 --> 44:43.951
Oh. Well, in that case,

44:43.984 --> 44:45.719
we gotta make these cookies
extra special.

44:45.753 --> 44:47.164
All right. You're gonna be
in charge of the raisins,

44:47.188 --> 44:49.490
and you are gonna be in charge
of the chocolate chips...

44:49.524 --> 44:50.767
more of which should be
in the batter,

44:50.791 --> 44:51.825
not your mouth.

44:51.859 --> 44:53.194
Hello?

44:53.227 --> 44:54.161
I've been knocking on
the front door

44:54.195 --> 44:55.462
for five minutes.

44:55.496 --> 44:56.940
Don't you guys know
how a front door works?

44:56.964 --> 44:58.899
Well, you obviously do.
How are you?

44:58.933 --> 45:00.267
What are you doing here?

45:00.301 --> 45:01.444
Figured you guys are
raising money for the team,

45:01.468 --> 45:02.236
so I thought I'd come and help.

45:02.269 --> 45:04.104
Yeah. Grab an apron.
Right there.

45:04.138 --> 45:05.940
Yes, ma'am.

45:05.973 --> 45:09.076
You know what I missed the most
when I was living in Atlanta

45:09.109 --> 45:10.945
was your family's baking.

45:10.978 --> 45:12.980
Why were you in Atlanta, Coach?

45:13.013 --> 45:14.381
Fiancée had a job there.

45:15.783 --> 45:17.117
You have a fiancée?

45:17.151 --> 45:18.852
"Had," yes.

45:18.886 --> 45:20.854
You guys want to hear
how I proposed?

45:20.888 --> 45:22.823
It was very dramatic.

45:22.856 --> 45:24.058
Lots of grand gestures.

45:24.091 --> 45:25.292
Grand gestures?

45:25.326 --> 45:26.427
Oh, big gestures.

45:26.460 --> 45:28.128
It might even be too romantic.

45:28.162 --> 45:29.306
You know what?
I'm not gonna tell you.

45:29.330 --> 45:31.365
So where is she now?

45:31.398 --> 45:34.068
Sometimes, things
don't go as planned,

45:34.101 --> 45:35.502
but that's all right.

45:35.537 --> 45:37.204
You just got to keep moving,
you know?

45:40.941 --> 45:43.310
All right. I think that tray's
ready for the oven.

45:43.344 --> 45:44.555
Do you guys, uh, want to run
to the pantry downstairs

45:44.579 --> 45:45.547
and grab some more

45:45.580 --> 45:47.181
- cookie sheets?
- Sure.

45:47.214 --> 45:48.849
What am I doing?

45:48.882 --> 45:50.918
Um, there.
You can roll those into balls.

45:50.951 --> 45:52.286
Into balls. Okay, I can do that.

45:56.957 --> 45:57.992
So, you were engaged?

45:58.025 --> 45:59.159
I had no idea. I'm sorry.

45:59.193 --> 46:00.794
Oh, how would you?

46:00.828 --> 46:03.297
It was wild too, Josie.

46:03.330 --> 46:06.867
I could see it all...
a whole life. Kids.

46:06.900 --> 46:09.504
Dogs, white picket fence...
all of it.

46:09.537 --> 46:13.073
Well, you always were
so romantic.

46:13.107 --> 46:15.242
Yeah. I'm like a walking
Ryan Gosling movie.

46:15.276 --> 46:16.436
- You really are.
- Thank you.

46:17.945 --> 46:19.847
That's how I refer to you.

46:19.880 --> 46:23.518
Yeah. And then, one day,
Lisa came home from a work trip,

46:23.551 --> 46:26.186
told me she had
met somebody else.

46:26.220 --> 46:28.355
Didn't mean to fall in love,
but she did.

46:28.389 --> 46:30.924
I'm sorry. So what'd you do?

46:32.560 --> 46:34.361
I did what anybody does.

46:34.395 --> 46:35.405
You know,
I wallowed for a while,

46:35.429 --> 46:37.364
face-down in the dirt,

46:37.398 --> 46:39.967
till one day, my mom came by,
and grabbed me by the collar,

46:40.000 --> 46:42.236
and picked me up.

46:42.269 --> 46:44.071
Explained to me very clearly

46:44.104 --> 46:49.577
that, when one door closes,
another one opens,

46:49.611 --> 46:51.845
and eventually,
I'd find my door.

46:51.879 --> 46:53.147
Mm.

46:53.180 --> 46:54.424
Your mom always
gave great advice.

46:54.448 --> 46:56.417
Yeah.

46:56.450 --> 46:58.819
I feel like I could use
some of that myself right now.

47:01.556 --> 47:03.066
I don't know, Cooper,
I feel like two months ago,

47:03.090 --> 47:05.259
I had a really clear path
for my life.

47:05.292 --> 47:07.194
You know, in New York,

47:07.227 --> 47:10.964
I had a vision for where
things were going, and now I...

47:10.998 --> 47:12.833
I don't know.
I'm feeling kind of lost.

47:14.068 --> 47:15.836
You'll find your door.

47:19.674 --> 47:21.275
Oh.

47:21.308 --> 47:23.043
Tony. Right.

47:23.077 --> 47:24.478
I... I need to take this.

47:24.512 --> 47:25.913
Go ahead.

47:25.946 --> 47:27.181
I'll be here, baking.

47:28.315 --> 47:29.950
<i>Hey, you.</i>

47:29.983 --> 47:31.586
- Welcome back, friends.
- Thank you.

47:31.619 --> 47:33.420
Sorry it's taken
so long to connect,

47:33.454 --> 47:34.955
but it's been nuts up here.

47:34.988 --> 47:36.957
<i>So how's your family holding up?</i>

47:36.990 --> 47:39.126
Uh, you know, we're okay.

47:39.159 --> 47:42.162
It's been really hard,
but we're making it work.

47:42.196 --> 47:44.031
Good. I'm glad.

47:44.064 --> 47:46.033
So...

47:46.066 --> 47:47.611
when do you think
you'll be coming back home?

47:47.635 --> 47:49.937
That's the thing.

47:49.970 --> 47:51.238
I... I really don't know.

47:51.271 --> 47:53.974
I think this is more long-term
than I expected.

47:54.007 --> 47:56.043
Wow. Okay.

47:56.076 --> 47:57.411
That's, um...

47:57.444 --> 47:59.279
What?

47:59.313 --> 48:01.315
It's just...

48:01.348 --> 48:03.050
Josie, we talked about this.

48:03.083 --> 48:05.452
Long distance,
it doesn't really work for me.

48:05.486 --> 48:06.353
I've tried it before, and...

48:06.387 --> 48:08.623
I know, but what do you
expect me to do?

48:08.656 --> 48:10.190
I mean, the kids need me here.

48:10.224 --> 48:12.459
I get it.

48:12.493 --> 48:15.262
I get it, and you should
be there for them.

48:15.295 --> 48:16.373
<i>I love that you're taking care
of your family.</i>

48:16.397 --> 48:17.699
<i>It's just...</i>

48:17.732 --> 48:19.667
Just what?

48:19.701 --> 48:22.269
I need someone who's...

48:22.302 --> 48:23.470
<i>Uh, I don't know.</i>

48:23.505 --> 48:24.505
What are you saying?

48:25.607 --> 48:26.607
What are you saying?

48:27.542 --> 48:29.076
I'm...

48:30.645 --> 48:32.413
Tony, I think this is just over.

48:32.446 --> 48:34.649
I really think it's over.

48:34.682 --> 48:37.451
I guess, if we're being honest,

48:37.484 --> 48:40.154
it... it kind of felt like
it already was.

48:41.523 --> 48:43.290
Um, I'm sorry.

48:43.323 --> 48:44.958
Don't be.

48:44.992 --> 48:46.594
Good luck out there, Josie.

48:48.228 --> 48:49.664
Bye, Tony.

48:56.136 --> 48:58.540
Get out of my station, okay?
I got this covered.

49:04.411 --> 49:05.713
Everything okay?

49:08.482 --> 49:10.217
Yeah. We-We... we just broke up.

49:12.319 --> 49:14.021
I'm sorry, Josie.
Are you all right?

49:15.422 --> 49:17.491
I'm don't know. Yeah.

49:20.461 --> 49:22.329
Did you just throw flour at me?

49:22.362 --> 49:24.198
It... It was an accident,
I-I swear.

49:24.231 --> 49:25.332
Really?

49:29.203 --> 49:31.004
Really? Was it an acci...

49:31.038 --> 49:33.508
- Oh!
- An accident?

49:33.541 --> 49:34.742
Was that an accident?

49:34.776 --> 49:37.344
Everybody, calm...
calm down, calm down.

49:38.445 --> 49:40.682
No, not an accident!

49:40.715 --> 49:41.783
Take...

49:41.816 --> 49:43.317
Okay. Okay!

49:45.319 --> 49:47.354
Dodge! Dodge!

50:01.335 --> 50:03.103
Hmm.

50:03.136 --> 50:06.173
Seven-letter word, across,
for "merrymaking."

50:06.206 --> 50:07.809
Begins with an "R".

50:07.842 --> 50:08.810
"Revelry."

50:08.843 --> 50:09.777
Hmm?

50:09.811 --> 50:11.546
Trust me, it's revelry.

50:11.579 --> 50:13.213
Oh! Josie!

50:14.348 --> 50:16.216
So it is!

50:16.250 --> 50:18.452
I heard that
you were back in town.

50:18.485 --> 50:20.722
Uh, I was hoping that maybe
you could fix this bracelet.

50:20.755 --> 50:22.322
It needs a new clasp,

50:22.356 --> 50:25.392
and I was hoping to add
a little basketball charm.

50:25.425 --> 50:28.295
Trying to do something special
for my niece.

50:28.328 --> 50:29.831
Oh. You know what?

50:29.864 --> 50:33.200
I think I have just the thing,
and Delilah will love it.

50:33.233 --> 50:34.234
Thank you. That's great.

50:34.268 --> 50:36.370
Speaking of something special,

50:36.403 --> 50:39.406
you should see
the engagement ring

50:39.439 --> 50:40.842
that Coach Cooper ordered today.

50:42.242 --> 50:43.377
Engagement ring?

50:43.410 --> 50:44.746
And apparently,

50:44.779 --> 50:47.749
there's some sort of
grand gesture in the works.

50:47.782 --> 50:50.117
Grand gesture?

50:51.653 --> 50:52.653
Huh.

51:14.308 --> 51:15.853
All better.
You're my strong girl, right?

51:15.877 --> 51:17.521
And your brother's
gonna take good care of you.

51:17.545 --> 51:19.581
You know it, Aunt Josie.

51:19.614 --> 51:20.782
Now if you guys go inside,

51:20.815 --> 51:21.825
I think Grandpa
has some cookies.

51:21.849 --> 51:23.483
Come on, Delilah.

51:25.185 --> 51:27.354
Oh, thank you.

51:27.387 --> 51:28.255
You're so great with them.

51:28.288 --> 51:30.190
Aw. They're so cute.

51:30.223 --> 51:31.593
They roughhouse
just like we did.

51:31.626 --> 51:32.860
Nothing scares Delilah.

51:32.894 --> 51:34.696
She's exactly
like you were at her age.

51:34.729 --> 51:36.531
Um, sorry, but for the record,

51:36.564 --> 51:38.609
I am gonna teach them everything
you don't want them to know.

51:38.633 --> 51:39.667
Bring it on.

51:39.701 --> 51:41.335
I want them to be as strong,

51:41.368 --> 51:44.672
independent, curious,
and brave as you are.

51:44.706 --> 51:46.541
- I'm none of those things.
- Yes, you are.

51:46.574 --> 51:48.284
I can't wait until you have
kids of your own, Jojo.

51:48.308 --> 51:49.744
And then you move back home,

51:49.777 --> 51:51.613
and we can raise
our families together.

51:51.646 --> 51:54.348
Aw. Yeah. I'll put that
on my to-do list,

51:54.381 --> 51:57.184
right after "work my way out of
a cubicle at the ad agency."

51:57.217 --> 51:59.152
Oh, you'll get your office
in no time.

51:59.186 --> 52:01.455
And then, when you're ready,

52:01.488 --> 52:04.424
you are going to be
a spectacular mom.

52:04.458 --> 52:05.893
I just know it.

52:10.665 --> 52:12.299
Victor, hi!

52:12.332 --> 52:13.534
Hey, good morning, Josie.

52:13.568 --> 52:14.769
Sorry to bother you.

52:14.802 --> 52:16.704
I know you've got
a lot going on right now,

52:16.738 --> 52:18.381
but you've been
pretty hard to reach lately.

52:18.405 --> 52:20.283
Yes, and I'm sorry about that,
but I assure you,

52:20.307 --> 52:21.552
the VodaSpring layouts
are almost ready.

52:21.576 --> 52:23.778
No, it's fine.
Don't even worry about it.

52:23.811 --> 52:24.746
No, no. I can have it
to you right away.

52:24.779 --> 52:25.747
<i>No, really.</i>

52:25.780 --> 52:26.890
Carol already took care of it.

52:26.914 --> 52:28.650
Carol?

52:28.683 --> 52:30.618
Victor, VodaSpring
is my account.

52:30.652 --> 52:32.772
Not anymore. That's why
I've been trying to reach you.

52:34.287 --> 52:35.927
I-I'm sorry. Are you...
Are you firing me?

52:35.957 --> 52:37.792
No, not at all.

52:37.825 --> 52:40.494
Uh, but after you walked out
on the client pitch,

52:40.528 --> 52:42.338
I realized you have
way too much going on right now.

52:42.362 --> 52:43.865
So where does that leave me?

52:43.898 --> 52:45.600
It's really up to you.

52:45.633 --> 52:47.769
Why don't you take some time,
think it over?

52:47.802 --> 52:49.236
<i>There'll always be a place here</i>

52:49.269 --> 52:51.171
<i>if you ever
come back to New York.</i>

52:54.709 --> 52:56.443
Bake sale.

52:57.679 --> 52:58.980
He gave my account away,

52:59.013 --> 53:00.815
and the rebrand
was my idea to begin with.

53:00.848 --> 53:02.482
Okay. But you still have a job?

53:02.517 --> 53:03.851
I don't know.

53:03.885 --> 53:05.461
He said he was putting me
on a leave of absence.

53:05.485 --> 53:07.655
Right. Yeah, I'm not
seeing the problem here.

53:07.689 --> 53:09.524
The problem is,

53:09.557 --> 53:11.434
I've clawed my way up the ranks
at that company for 12 years,

53:11.458 --> 53:12.894
and I feel like
it's falling apart.

53:12.927 --> 53:15.495
Ah. Kind of sounds like
your boss is doing you a favor.

53:15.530 --> 53:17.665
How's that?

53:17.699 --> 53:20.333
He's giving you a chance
to figure out what you want.

53:20.367 --> 53:21.769
I mean, look around.

53:21.803 --> 53:23.771
Your friends are here,
your family's here,

53:23.805 --> 53:25.305
and you're not
enjoying yourself.

53:25.338 --> 53:26.684
You're busy worrying
about your job.

53:26.708 --> 53:27.942
I'm no expert,

53:27.975 --> 53:29.409
but maybe it's not a bad idea

53:29.443 --> 53:31.913
to just try to enjoy it
while you can.

53:31.946 --> 53:33.915
Figure out the problems
as they come, you know?

53:33.948 --> 53:35.025
It's just easier said than done.

53:35.049 --> 53:36.851
Yeah.

53:36.884 --> 53:37.895
I'm not saying you're right.

53:37.919 --> 53:39.921
Okay.

53:39.954 --> 53:40.822
All right. We're all set.

53:40.855 --> 53:42.322
Up top.

53:42.355 --> 53:43.466
Look at that. It looks so good.

53:43.490 --> 53:44.692
Thanks.

53:44.726 --> 53:45.993
Don't leave me hanging, Ben.

53:46.027 --> 53:47.027
What do we have here?

53:51.766 --> 53:53.668
These are not half-bad.

53:53.701 --> 53:56.838
Thanks, Grandpa.
Aunt Josie helped us make 'em.

53:56.871 --> 53:57.939
Nice job, Jojo.

53:57.972 --> 53:59.439
Thanks, Dad.

54:00.842 --> 54:02.677
- Cooper?
- Yeah?

54:02.710 --> 54:04.545
That Chevy of mine
you dented in high school?

54:04.579 --> 54:05.780
It's still got a dent in it.

54:05.813 --> 54:07.024
Still won't let that one go,
huh, Pete?

54:07.048 --> 54:08.750
- Nah.
- Okay.

54:08.783 --> 54:11.719
I know how to kick
this bake sale into high gear.

54:11.753 --> 54:14.055
These are
two bonafide horseshoes.

54:14.088 --> 54:15.857
Fun fact...

54:15.890 --> 54:16.991
they're good luck,

54:17.024 --> 54:18.458
but you've gotta keep the ends

54:18.492 --> 54:19.937
pointed up,
otherwise the luck falls out.

54:19.961 --> 54:21.304
A little bit of science
for you guys.

54:21.328 --> 54:22.864
That's not science.

54:22.897 --> 54:24.665
Don't listen to her.
It's science.

54:24.699 --> 54:26.534
- These from your barn?
- Yes, sir, they are.

54:26.567 --> 54:27.711
I'm gonna be right back.
I'm gonna get more stuff.

54:27.735 --> 54:29.504
Awesome.

54:29.537 --> 54:32.339
Coach Cooper's
got the coolest barn.

54:32.372 --> 54:35.576
We went there for a field trip.
He's got so many horses.

54:35.610 --> 54:37.530
Really? I didn't know
you loved horses that much.

54:38.546 --> 54:39.857
Hey, hey, guys.
I'm so sorry I'm late,

54:39.881 --> 54:42.717
but, hey, I did bring
some goodies of my own, so.

54:42.750 --> 54:45.086
Did you make those, Uncle Jeff?

54:45.119 --> 54:47.387
Come on, Delilah.

54:47.420 --> 54:48.890
Your mom was the baker
in the family.

54:48.923 --> 54:51.058
Uncle Jeff's a computer whiz.

54:51.092 --> 54:52.603
Probably coming up
with the next big invention.

54:52.627 --> 54:53.594
Right, Jeff?

54:53.628 --> 54:56.063
Yeah, that's right, Pop.

54:56.097 --> 54:58.065
Yeah, I picked these up
on my way over here.

54:58.099 --> 54:59.901
Hey, if you and Cooper
want to take a break,

54:59.934 --> 55:01.334
the kids and I
can man this table.

55:01.368 --> 55:02.369
You want to take a break?

55:03.470 --> 55:04.505
Yeah?

55:04.539 --> 55:05.740
I love breaks!

55:05.773 --> 55:07.350
All right.
Well, give me the tour, Coach.

55:07.374 --> 55:08.843
- Yes, ma'am.
- All right.

55:12.647 --> 55:14.015
Do you remember this place?

55:14.048 --> 55:15.750
Oh, of course, I do.

55:15.783 --> 55:17.027
This is where
I performed <i>Grease.</i>

55:17.051 --> 55:18.418
Oh, yes.

55:18.451 --> 55:19.887
What a performance that was.

55:21.454 --> 55:23.356
I am still bitter
I didn't get to play Sandy.

55:23.390 --> 55:24.692
- Really?
- Yeah.

55:24.725 --> 55:26.493
Come on, let it go.
It's in the past.

55:28.461 --> 55:29.864
Oh.

55:29.897 --> 55:33.134
I feel like something else
also happened here.

55:33.167 --> 55:35.468
Huh.

55:35.502 --> 55:36.604
No...

55:36.637 --> 55:38.139
Nothing memorable.

55:38.172 --> 55:39.941
Nothing memorable?

55:39.974 --> 55:41.042
Mm...

55:41.075 --> 55:42.743
- That hurts.
- Oh, you know what?

55:42.777 --> 55:44.679
Yeah.

55:44.712 --> 55:45.847
We did kiss backstage.

55:47.615 --> 55:48.850
That was my first kiss.

55:48.883 --> 55:50.518
- Was it?
- Yeah. It was a good kiss.

55:50.551 --> 55:51.652
Mm-hmm.

55:53.721 --> 55:55.488
- Uh, don't do that.
- Okay.

55:59.961 --> 56:02.429
Oh. There's something about it,
being here.

56:02.462 --> 56:03.898
I feel like
I just breathe deeper.

56:05.766 --> 56:08.002
I mean, yeah, you're back home.

56:08.035 --> 56:11.639
You know, everyone's been
so nice and comforting.

56:13.140 --> 56:15.076
There's just something
about my dad.

56:15.109 --> 56:17.144
I feel like he kind of
doesn't want me here.

56:17.178 --> 56:19.412
Maybe he just doesn't want
to get his hopes up,

56:19.446 --> 56:20.748
in case you leave again.

56:20.781 --> 56:22.449
No, he practically
pushed me out the door

56:22.482 --> 56:23.718
and encouraged me to go home.

56:23.751 --> 56:26.721
Jo, every time
I've seen that man,

56:26.754 --> 56:28.890
all he's done is talk about you.

56:28.923 --> 56:30.858
I think
he just misses you a lot, Jo.

56:32.059 --> 56:34.562
Hmm.

56:34.595 --> 56:35.596
What about you?

56:35.630 --> 56:36.797
Are you happy you moved back?

56:36.831 --> 56:38.599
Am I happy I moved back?

56:38.633 --> 56:40.433
Yeah.

56:40.467 --> 56:42.003
I mean, yeah.

56:42.036 --> 56:44.205
It's beautiful here.
It's my home.

56:44.238 --> 56:46.607
It's not the life
that I imagined,

56:46.641 --> 56:48.676
but it's the life I want now.

56:53.514 --> 56:55.049
Which reminds me,

56:55.082 --> 56:56.584
there's something
I wanted to ask you.

56:56.617 --> 56:58.886
Wait, Coop.

56:58.920 --> 56:59.820
I know you got
a lot on your plate,

56:59.854 --> 57:01.155
and I don't want to...

57:01.188 --> 57:03.624
I don't want to add to that,
but, uh,

57:03.658 --> 57:05.159
Josie, will you, um...

57:05.192 --> 57:06.937
Uh, okay. I... Cooper, I know
what you're gonna say.

57:06.961 --> 57:08.829
You do?

57:08.863 --> 57:11.464
Yeah.

57:11.498 --> 57:14.635
I... I know what you're feeling,
and it's... it's not real.

57:16.570 --> 57:18.506
Okay, maybe it's real,
but it's... it's...

57:18.539 --> 57:20.508
I've only been back
a short time,

57:20.541 --> 57:22.610
and, I mean,
I was just talking about

57:22.643 --> 57:23.887
how completely confused
and overwhelmed I am

57:23.911 --> 57:25.478
a minute ago,

57:25.513 --> 57:27.124
and that hasn't changed
in the last 60 seconds.

57:27.148 --> 57:29.650
It's been so nice
to hang out with you.

57:29.684 --> 57:31.585
It feels good.

57:31.619 --> 57:33.163
It feels really good,
but all of this talk

57:33.187 --> 57:34.789
about, you know, grand gestures,

57:34.822 --> 57:37.024
and what if
I had stayed in town...

57:37.058 --> 57:37.925
it's not grounded in reality,

57:37.959 --> 57:39.093
and right now,

57:39.126 --> 57:42.063
I have to be all about reality.

57:42.096 --> 57:45.266
I'm sorry if it hurts you,
but no.

57:45.299 --> 57:46.968
The answer is...
the answer is no.

57:49.537 --> 57:51.337
That's all right.
I'll just ask somebody else.

57:52.540 --> 57:53.808
What?

57:53.841 --> 57:56.077
I didn't realize
it would be such a big deal.

57:56.110 --> 57:57.912
Of... Of course it's a big deal.

57:57.945 --> 57:59.780
I mean, it's a...
it's a big deal.

57:59.814 --> 58:01.215
It's only temporary,

58:01.248 --> 58:02.817
until I get
another one of my own.

58:02.850 --> 58:04.685
I'm sorry.
Is one not enough for you?

58:04.719 --> 58:06.988
I think it's every guy's dream

58:07.021 --> 58:09.557
to have one for family
and one for weekend fun.

58:09.590 --> 58:11.750
How can you talk about
something like this so casually?

58:12.893 --> 58:14.071
What do you think
we're talking about?

58:14.095 --> 58:15.730
Marriage.

58:17.264 --> 58:18.833
What?

58:18.866 --> 58:20.901
We're talking about...

58:20.935 --> 58:22.636
Did you think
I was proposing to you?

58:24.138 --> 58:26.207
You... Okay, no.

58:26.240 --> 58:27.675
Mr. Cox, he said

58:27.708 --> 58:28.952
that you ordered
an engagement ring

58:28.976 --> 58:31.145
for a grand gesture!

58:31.178 --> 58:32.813
And we're sitting here,

58:32.847 --> 58:35.216
and you pull this-this ring box
out of your pocket.

58:35.249 --> 58:37.118
It was jamming into my leg.

58:37.151 --> 58:38.586
This is Nate's.

58:38.619 --> 58:40.221
He's proposing to Molly
next week.

58:40.254 --> 58:42.823
So what are you doing with it?

58:42.857 --> 58:44.792
He had me
arrange the whole thing

58:44.825 --> 58:45.993
so he wouldn't get caught.

58:46.027 --> 58:47.661
But then you brought me here,

58:47.695 --> 58:49.764
and you said that you wanted
to ask me something.

58:49.797 --> 58:51.332
I do want to ask you something.

58:51.365 --> 58:52.767
I wanted to ask you

58:52.800 --> 58:54.711
if I could use your father's van
for game nights.

58:54.735 --> 58:56.604
The van?

58:56.637 --> 58:58.706
Yes, just until I get
enough money to get my own,

58:58.739 --> 59:00.841
and since I crashed
his Chevy in high school,

59:00.875 --> 59:01.885
I thought
I didn't want to ask him.

59:01.909 --> 59:03.277
I thought
maybe you could ask him.

59:03.310 --> 59:04.945
Of course,
you can borrow the van.

59:04.979 --> 59:05.813
You can have the van.

59:05.846 --> 59:07.348
Thank you.

59:07.381 --> 59:10.584
Yeah. I'm just gonna go
crawl under a rock over there.

59:10.618 --> 59:12.195
- Don't do that.
- We can never speak of this.

59:12.219 --> 59:14.021
- No, it's okay!
- Thank you so much.

59:14.055 --> 59:16.223
It's a common mistake.

59:16.257 --> 59:17.868
- I'll just go.
- It happens all the time.

59:17.892 --> 59:19.226
Could've been yours.

59:19.260 --> 59:20.820
It'd be great
if we never spoke of this.

59:38.646 --> 59:39.646
You got this, Delilah!

59:40.748 --> 59:43.384
Keep moving, ladies!
Pull in that D! Come on!

59:45.886 --> 59:47.655
Hanging in that net.

59:49.056 --> 59:50.091
Pass another one.

1:00:00.968 --> 1:00:02.736
Go, Delilah! Come on!

1:00:02.770 --> 1:00:03.770
All right, let's go!

1:00:05.106 --> 1:00:06.273
Come on, Delilah. Run it in!

1:00:12.413 --> 1:00:14.048
Yay!

1:00:15.249 --> 1:00:16.717
Whoo!

1:00:16.750 --> 1:00:18.419
Yay! Hey!

1:00:21.956 --> 1:00:22.956
Here she comes.

1:00:23.958 --> 1:00:25.092
Oh! Here she is!

1:00:25.126 --> 1:00:26.861
I'm so proud of you.
That was awesome.

1:00:26.894 --> 1:00:27.895
Thank you.

1:00:30.097 --> 1:00:31.866
- Oh, hi, Josie.
- Hello.

1:00:32.933 --> 1:00:34.201
I...

1:00:34.235 --> 1:00:35.736
I am so embarrassed.

1:00:35.769 --> 1:00:36.769
Embarrassed about what?

1:00:37.905 --> 1:00:39.073
You know.

1:00:39.106 --> 1:00:40.207
I don't know.

1:00:40.241 --> 1:00:41.342
Come on.

1:00:41.375 --> 1:00:43.043
Yesterday at the bake sale.

1:00:43.077 --> 1:00:44.345
What happened at the bake sale?

1:00:44.378 --> 1:00:46.046
I... the ring?

1:00:46.080 --> 1:00:47.047
Oh!

1:00:47.081 --> 1:00:48.315
You're talking about

1:00:48.349 --> 1:00:50.017
where you thought
I was proposing to you

1:00:50.050 --> 1:00:52.019
at the most inappropriate time
ever in history?

1:00:52.052 --> 1:00:53.120
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1:00:53.154 --> 1:00:54.221
I don't remember that.

1:00:54.255 --> 1:00:55.689
Great.

1:00:55.723 --> 1:00:57.057
That's...

1:00:57.091 --> 1:00:58.468
- Thank you. You're the best.
- You're welcome.

1:00:58.492 --> 1:01:00.761
And thank you
for convincing your father

1:01:00.794 --> 1:01:02.272
to let me use the van.
I appreciate that.

1:01:02.296 --> 1:01:03.964
Oh, yeah.
No, he was happy to do it.

1:01:03.998 --> 1:01:05.299
I mean, he did take out

1:01:05.332 --> 1:01:07.234
the extra, you know,
collision insurance,

1:01:07.268 --> 1:01:08.712
but just on the nights
that you're driving it, so.

1:01:08.736 --> 1:01:09.970
Really?

1:01:10.004 --> 1:01:11.105
No. I'm kidding.

1:01:11.138 --> 1:01:12.239
- Nice.
- Yeah.

1:01:12.273 --> 1:01:13.774
That's good. I see what you did.

1:01:13.807 --> 1:01:15.309
Anyway, congrats on the game.

1:01:15.342 --> 1:01:17.311
Thank you.

1:01:17.344 --> 1:01:19.346
Um, will you excuse me
for just a second?

1:01:19.380 --> 1:01:20.848
Sure.

1:01:20.881 --> 1:01:22.049
Go ahead.

1:01:23.484 --> 1:01:25.219
Hi. Lily?

1:01:25.252 --> 1:01:26.987
I'm Josie.
I'm Ben and Delilah's aunt.

1:01:27.021 --> 1:01:28.031
I don't think we've met yet.

1:01:28.055 --> 1:01:29.089
Of course. Hi.

1:01:29.123 --> 1:01:30.324
Miss Wilder?

1:01:30.357 --> 1:01:31.292
Hi. Can I talk to you
for a second?

1:01:31.325 --> 1:01:32.893
Yeah.

1:01:32.927 --> 1:01:34.128
I'll talk to you later, Ivan.

1:01:34.161 --> 1:01:35.496
Hey.

1:01:35.530 --> 1:01:36.730
What's up?

1:01:36.764 --> 1:01:38.732
Listen.

1:01:38.766 --> 1:01:41.268
I was your age once,
so I get it.

1:01:41.302 --> 1:01:44.305
You know, a girl feels special
when a boy likes her.

1:01:44.338 --> 1:01:46.407
I mean, not that that should be
the end-all, be-all,

1:01:46.440 --> 1:01:47.951
because how boys feel about us
shouldn't determine

1:01:47.975 --> 1:01:49.743
our self-esteem, right?

1:01:49.777 --> 1:01:50.945
Right?

1:01:52.079 --> 1:01:53.781
Uh, right. Right.

1:01:53.814 --> 1:01:55.482
When a boy likes you,

1:01:55.517 --> 1:01:57.194
it's important
that you not only think about

1:01:57.218 --> 1:01:59.262
how it makes you feel,
but also how it makes him feel.

1:01:59.286 --> 1:02:00.764
You know, and this guy Ivan
that you're hanging out with,

1:02:00.788 --> 1:02:02.056
like, it seems like

1:02:02.089 --> 1:02:03.290
you like him and he likes you,

1:02:03.324 --> 1:02:04.901
and you guys feel pretty good
about it, right?

1:02:04.925 --> 1:02:07.027
Miss Wilder,

1:02:07.061 --> 1:02:08.905
I'm not sure I fully understand
what this is about.

1:02:08.929 --> 1:02:11.465
So you like Ivan,
and he likes you,

1:02:11.498 --> 1:02:13.367
but you also like Ben,

1:02:13.400 --> 1:02:15.869
and he likes you.

1:02:15.903 --> 1:02:17.137
He does?

1:02:19.240 --> 1:02:22.977
I mean, I li... I like Ben,
but I don't like-like him.

1:02:24.211 --> 1:02:26.380
Oh, right. Okay.

1:02:26.413 --> 1:02:29.183
Um, you know, there's just
kind of a gray area

1:02:29.216 --> 1:02:30.427
between "like" and "like-like."

1:02:30.451 --> 1:02:32.052
Like, someone may like-like you
and think

1:02:32.086 --> 1:02:33.430
that you like-like them,
but you only <i>like</i> them,

1:02:33.454 --> 1:02:35.131
and you don't even know
that they like-like you.

1:02:35.155 --> 1:02:37.024
Did... Did that make any sense?

1:02:38.993 --> 1:02:40.427
That didn't make sense. Right.

1:02:40.461 --> 1:02:41.996
Um...

1:02:42.029 --> 1:02:43.230
what I'm trying to say is,

1:02:43.264 --> 1:02:45.432
if you only
like Ben as a friend,

1:02:45.466 --> 1:02:47.901
you should probably tell him
so nobody gets hurt.

1:02:49.169 --> 1:02:50.904
Is it okay if I go now?

1:02:50.938 --> 1:02:53.207
My grandma's taking me
to get ice cream.

1:02:53.240 --> 1:02:54.542
Oh, yeah. Of course.

1:02:54.576 --> 1:02:56.076
No, thanks for talking.

1:02:56.110 --> 1:02:57.778
Enjoy the ice cream.

1:02:58.979 --> 1:03:00.881
Um, yeah.

1:03:12.459 --> 1:03:14.562
<i>That was
some basketball game, huh?</i>

1:03:14.596 --> 1:03:15.829
Yeah. You were so good.

1:03:15.863 --> 1:03:17.197
MVP over here!

1:03:17.231 --> 1:03:18.399
Whoo!

1:03:18.432 --> 1:03:19.476
So glad you could
join us, Cooper.

1:03:19.500 --> 1:03:20.968
My pleasure.

1:03:21.001 --> 1:03:21.835
We wouldn't have won
without you.

1:03:21.869 --> 1:03:22.870
No.

1:03:22.903 --> 1:03:24.038
Now, I have to admit,

1:03:24.071 --> 1:03:26.140
I do not know as much
about basketball

1:03:26.173 --> 1:03:28.375
as your father
or Uncle Jeff, but...

1:03:28.409 --> 1:03:29.910
Or Aunt Josie's ex-boyfriend.

1:03:29.943 --> 1:03:32.012
He works for the NBA
in New York.

1:03:32.046 --> 1:03:33.847
Well, I guess
that makes your aunt

1:03:33.881 --> 1:03:36.116
a bit of a sports expert,
huh, Ben?

1:03:36.150 --> 1:03:37.885
Well, I know a thing or two.

1:03:37.918 --> 1:03:39.296
Oh, you do? Okay.
Well, you tell me,

1:03:39.320 --> 1:03:42.089
a three-point shot
is worth how many points?

1:03:42.122 --> 1:03:44.526
Oh, I don't know, Jeff.
Let me think about that.

1:03:44.559 --> 1:03:45.593
Oh... three points.

1:03:45.627 --> 1:03:47.094
Checks out.

1:03:50.464 --> 1:03:51.633
Try me, Coach.

1:03:51.666 --> 1:03:53.033
- Try you?
- Yeah.

1:03:53.067 --> 1:03:54.868
What's a box-and-one?

1:03:54.902 --> 1:03:56.970
When...

1:03:57.004 --> 1:03:58.540
you...

1:03:58.573 --> 1:04:00.474
get a box from Amazon
and also a magazine.

1:04:00.508 --> 1:04:01.508
There it is. You got it.

1:04:04.945 --> 1:04:06.614
Speaking of getting something...

1:04:09.450 --> 1:04:10.351
this is for you.

1:04:10.384 --> 1:04:11.852
Hmm.

1:04:18.058 --> 1:04:20.361
When your mom turned 16,
I gave her a charm bracelet,

1:04:20.394 --> 1:04:22.564
and I found it
in one of the drawers

1:04:22.597 --> 1:04:24.298
in the guest bedroom.

1:04:24.331 --> 1:04:25.633
I thought you might like it.

1:04:28.570 --> 1:04:30.337
And see?

1:04:30.371 --> 1:04:32.282
I even put a little basketball
charm there for you.

1:04:32.306 --> 1:04:34.341
I know how much she loved
watching you play it, so.

1:04:35.577 --> 1:04:37.177
This was my mom's?

1:04:37.211 --> 1:04:38.879
It was.

1:04:40.247 --> 1:04:42.483
I have to go to the restroom.

1:04:46.554 --> 1:04:49.089
Hey, she's gonna be fine.

1:04:49.123 --> 1:04:50.157
No, she won't.

1:04:51.559 --> 1:04:53.227
That was so lame.

1:04:53.260 --> 1:04:54.995
- Ben!
- Benjamin! Come on.

1:04:55.028 --> 1:04:56.631
It was.

1:04:56.664 --> 1:04:58.265
Delilah was
in a really good mood,

1:04:58.298 --> 1:04:59.677
and then Aunt Josie goes
and reminds her of Mom.

1:04:59.701 --> 1:05:01.603
Come on. Ben, your aunt
was just trying to...

1:05:01.636 --> 1:05:03.170
You should just stop trying.

1:05:03.203 --> 1:05:04.214
You're ruining everything!

1:05:04.238 --> 1:05:05.339
Ben.

1:05:05.372 --> 1:05:06.473
You are!

1:05:06.508 --> 1:05:07.609
Why did you talk to her?

1:05:07.642 --> 1:05:09.309
Who?

1:05:09.343 --> 1:05:10.987
Lily! Now she thinks
I'm totally in love with her

1:05:11.011 --> 1:05:13.515
a-and that I made you
go up to her

1:05:13.548 --> 1:05:14.658
and chew her out
for dancing with Ivan.

1:05:14.682 --> 1:05:16.450
Ben, I didn't...

1:05:16.483 --> 1:05:17.317
I don't know why Mom and Dad
thought you'd be good at this.

1:05:17.351 --> 1:05:18.662
You should just go back
to the city.

1:05:18.686 --> 1:05:19.686
You know you want to.

1:05:27.629 --> 1:05:29.062
Excuse me.

1:05:33.535 --> 1:05:34.702
I'm gonna go talk to her.

1:05:36.470 --> 1:05:38.338
Well, I'm going to go
and check on Delilah.

1:05:51.318 --> 1:05:54.722
Delilah,
she'll be fine, she's tough.

1:05:54.756 --> 1:05:57.124
And Ben'll come around.

1:05:57.157 --> 1:05:58.560
I'm a failure.

1:05:58.593 --> 1:05:59.737
You are not a failure, Josie.

1:05:59.761 --> 1:06:01.629
Yeah. I am.

1:06:04.732 --> 1:06:07.367
When Ellie died, I...

1:06:11.171 --> 1:06:13.474
I didn't lose my sister,
I lost my best friend.

1:06:13.508 --> 1:06:16.176
I know.

1:06:16.210 --> 1:06:17.588
And all I could think was,
you know,

1:06:17.612 --> 1:06:19.112
whatever I'm feeling,

1:06:19.146 --> 1:06:22.550
those kids are feeling it
a thousand times harder,

1:06:22.584 --> 1:06:25.219
and I...

1:06:25.252 --> 1:06:26.353
just wanted to help them.

1:06:27.488 --> 1:06:29.389
You are helping them.

1:06:29.423 --> 1:06:31.091
No, I'm not.

1:06:31.124 --> 1:06:32.192
Come on, you heard Ben.

1:06:32.226 --> 1:06:33.494
I make everything worse.

1:06:33.528 --> 1:06:35.062
Josie, you gotta
stop doing that.

1:06:35.095 --> 1:06:37.064
You gotta stop
beating yourself up.

1:06:37.097 --> 1:06:39.567
This is not
an easy circumstance,

1:06:39.601 --> 1:06:41.268
for anyone.

1:06:42.469 --> 1:06:44.404
These kids love you...

1:06:44.438 --> 1:06:46.708
no matter what they say.

1:06:46.741 --> 1:06:49.042
It's okay to make mistakes...

1:06:49.076 --> 1:06:50.521
everybody's going to,
in this situation.

1:06:50.545 --> 1:06:51.646
Everyone.

1:06:51.679 --> 1:06:53.313
But, Cooper, in New York,

1:06:53.347 --> 1:06:55.058
when I make a mistake,
I mean, when I would screw up,

1:06:55.082 --> 1:06:56.784
it would only hurt me.

1:06:56.818 --> 1:06:59.086
Since I've been here,
every time I screw up,

1:06:59.119 --> 1:07:00.655
I hurt people I love.

1:07:00.688 --> 1:07:03.056
I hurt people
who are already hurting,

1:07:03.090 --> 1:07:04.626
like Ben and Delilah.

1:07:04.659 --> 1:07:07.127
Ellie chose you for a reason.

1:07:08.495 --> 1:07:11.799
Obviously, she had faith in you.

1:07:11.833 --> 1:07:13.367
Maybe she made a mistake.

1:07:14.368 --> 1:07:16.136
In New York,

1:07:16.169 --> 1:07:17.815
I had this clear path
for my life, you know,

1:07:17.839 --> 1:07:19.807
this clear vision
that I could just see.

1:07:19.841 --> 1:07:22.309
I was in control of things,

1:07:22.342 --> 1:07:24.378
and I gave all that up,
happily gave that up,

1:07:24.411 --> 1:07:25.847
but to come here

1:07:25.880 --> 1:07:29.416
so I could mess up
everyone else's lives?

1:07:29.449 --> 1:07:31.351
I mean,
what's the point of that?

1:07:31.385 --> 1:07:33.353
These kids...

1:07:33.387 --> 1:07:35.523
they need a parent.

1:07:35.557 --> 1:07:38.125
Someone who's gonna be there
for them no matter what,

1:07:38.158 --> 1:07:39.594
and you are trying to do that.

1:07:43.698 --> 1:07:45.365
I think I should
go back to New York.

1:07:45.399 --> 1:07:47.167
I don't think you mean that.

1:07:47.200 --> 1:07:49.369
I think I should.

1:07:49.403 --> 1:07:51.114
Josie, you have never
been one to give up...

1:07:51.138 --> 1:07:52.415
- And I'm not giving up.
- When things get tough.

1:07:52.439 --> 1:07:53.808
I would never give up on them.

1:07:53.841 --> 1:07:57.545
I'm trying to do what's best
for them, Cooper, and...

1:07:58.880 --> 1:08:01.081
I think it's best for them
for me to just go.

1:08:02.482 --> 1:08:04.552
Whatever you do decide...

1:08:06.854 --> 1:08:08.221
just make sure

1:08:08.255 --> 1:08:09.824
you're doing it
for the right reasons.

1:08:54.535 --> 1:08:57.170
They're so sweet.

1:08:57.204 --> 1:08:58.673
What? No!

1:08:58.706 --> 1:09:00.546
No. Don't do a flash.
You're gonna wake 'em up.

1:09:01.542 --> 1:09:03.310
No flash!

1:09:05.345 --> 1:09:07.414
We should probably
get them upstairs to bed.

1:09:07.447 --> 1:09:09.249
Oh, do we have to?

1:09:09.282 --> 1:09:11.218
I could stay like this forever.

1:09:11.251 --> 1:09:13.286
It's the best feeling.

1:09:15.523 --> 1:09:17.424
Here, give me the phone.

1:09:42.249 --> 1:09:43.350
Hello?

1:09:43.383 --> 1:09:44.418
<i>Morning, Josie.</i>

1:09:44.451 --> 1:09:45.496
Hey, Nate. What's going on?

1:09:45.520 --> 1:09:46.854
I was headed to work
early today,

1:09:46.888 --> 1:09:48.632
and I saw some lights on
at your family restaurant.

1:09:48.656 --> 1:09:50.424
<i>Seemed kind of strange
at this hour.</i>

1:09:50.457 --> 1:09:51.324
Yeah. Thanks for
letting me know.

1:09:51.358 --> 1:09:52.225
I'll check it out.

1:09:52.259 --> 1:09:54.729
<i>Of course.</i>

1:10:25.059 --> 1:10:26.426
Jeff!

1:10:26.460 --> 1:10:28.629
What are you doing here?

1:10:28.663 --> 1:10:30.565
Um...

1:10:30.598 --> 1:10:32.299
making scones.

1:10:32.332 --> 1:10:33.601
What?

1:10:34.736 --> 1:10:35.837
Do you want one?

1:10:35.870 --> 1:10:37.839
Well... yeah.

1:10:37.872 --> 1:10:40.007
I love scones.

1:10:40.041 --> 1:10:41.374
Mm!

1:10:41.408 --> 1:10:43.010
These are amazing.

1:10:43.044 --> 1:10:44.746
Yeah? Yeah, you think so?

1:10:44.779 --> 1:10:46.748
But, Jeff...

1:10:46.781 --> 1:10:48.348
why are you making scones?

1:10:48.381 --> 1:10:49.793
I make something different
every day.

1:10:49.817 --> 1:10:51.586
Muffins, biscuits,

1:10:51.619 --> 1:10:53.721
those pastries
from the bake sale.

1:10:53.755 --> 1:10:55.388
Okay. But why?

1:10:56.891 --> 1:10:58.760
Uh...

1:10:58.793 --> 1:11:01.361
it's what I love to do.

1:11:01.394 --> 1:11:03.030
It's what I want to do.

1:11:03.064 --> 1:11:04.532
Well, what about your tech job?

1:11:04.565 --> 1:11:06.033
Well, what about it?

1:11:06.067 --> 1:11:08.603
See, I wake up super-early
every day,

1:11:08.636 --> 1:11:11.706
come in here, and I just...
I-I bake.

1:11:11.739 --> 1:11:13.674
I bake whatever's on my mind,

1:11:13.708 --> 1:11:16.409
and then I clean up the kitchen
before Dad gets here, obviously.

1:11:16.443 --> 1:11:17.979
Obviously.

1:11:18.012 --> 1:11:19.455
And then I take 'em
to a bunch of farmers' markets

1:11:19.479 --> 1:11:20.782
and I sell them.

1:11:20.815 --> 1:11:22.750
I... I just had no idea.

1:11:22.784 --> 1:11:25.052
Speaking of which,
I gotta get these

1:11:25.086 --> 1:11:27.320
to a farmers' market
in High Woods, so.

1:11:27.354 --> 1:11:29.090
You want some company?

1:11:29.123 --> 1:11:30.958
Since I'm probably leaving
in a day or two

1:11:30.992 --> 1:11:32.335
- to go back to the city...
- The city. Yeah.

1:11:32.359 --> 1:11:34.896
Hey, don't make fun.

1:11:34.929 --> 1:11:36.405
You know what?
You don't get a choice.

1:11:36.429 --> 1:11:37.598
- I'm coming with you.
- Okay.

1:11:37.632 --> 1:11:38.833
I gotta pack these up.

1:11:38.866 --> 1:11:39.866
All right.

1:11:41.102 --> 1:11:42.703
You sold out so fast.

1:11:42.737 --> 1:11:43.747
Seriously,
you're really good at this.

1:11:43.771 --> 1:11:45.006
Yeah, thank you.

1:11:45.039 --> 1:11:46.373
Hey, you should've seen the day

1:11:46.406 --> 1:11:47.775
that I took
my cran-apple muffins

1:11:47.809 --> 1:11:48.843
to Brentwood,

1:11:48.876 --> 1:11:49.911
'cause it was madness.

1:11:49.944 --> 1:11:51.088
Okay. I just don't understand

1:11:51.112 --> 1:11:52.013
why you're not
doing this full-time.

1:11:52.046 --> 1:11:53.648
It's way too risky.

1:11:53.681 --> 1:11:56.117
Besides, can you imagine
how Dad would react

1:11:56.150 --> 1:11:58.653
if I quit tech
to become "the Scone Son"?

1:11:58.686 --> 1:11:59.930
Ah, I think
he'd be okay with scones.

1:11:59.954 --> 1:12:01.722
No, you don't.

1:12:01.756 --> 1:12:04.424
And...

1:12:04.457 --> 1:12:06.103
Jeff, if Ellie's accident
taught me anything,

1:12:06.127 --> 1:12:08.495
it's that life is short

1:12:08.529 --> 1:12:10.832
and we gotta make
the most of every moment.

1:12:10.865 --> 1:12:13.366
You deserve this.

1:12:13.400 --> 1:12:14.711
I'm sorry
if I haven't been there for you

1:12:14.735 --> 1:12:16.137
as much as I should have.

1:12:16.170 --> 1:12:18.806
You know, I...
I guess I just retreated.

1:12:20.074 --> 1:12:21.642
You're my brother. Come on.

1:12:21.676 --> 1:12:23.578
We're always gonna have
each other's backs.

1:12:23.611 --> 1:12:24.879
I just want you to be happy.

1:12:26.479 --> 1:12:28.448
So is that why
you're leaving, then?

1:12:28.481 --> 1:12:30.852
Because New York
makes you happy?

1:12:32.452 --> 1:12:34.589
I don't know.
I'm trying to figure it out.

1:12:34.622 --> 1:12:36.891
Because even
if I get my accounts back,

1:12:36.924 --> 1:12:38.434
I'm still convincing people
to buy water

1:12:38.458 --> 1:12:39.760
from upstate New York

1:12:39.794 --> 1:12:40.695
by telling them
it's from the Czech Republic.

1:12:40.728 --> 1:12:42.697
Wait.

1:12:42.730 --> 1:12:44.497
So the water is the same, but...

1:12:44.532 --> 1:12:46.968
Yeah. Same water,
just fancy new label,

1:12:47.001 --> 1:12:49.570
but no matter
how hard we pretend

1:12:49.604 --> 1:12:50.747
it's something
completely different,

1:12:50.771 --> 1:12:52.540
it is what it is.

1:12:52.573 --> 1:12:53.674
It is where it came from.

1:12:53.708 --> 1:12:56.376
It's you... the water.

1:12:57.745 --> 1:12:59.814
You're the same old
"New Hope Josie Wilder,"

1:12:59.847 --> 1:13:01.015
but in a fancy.

1:13:01.048 --> 1:13:02.984
"New York Hotshot
Josie Wilder" label.

1:13:07.855 --> 1:13:09.123
Cooper. Hey.

1:13:09.156 --> 1:13:10.591
Josie.

1:13:10.625 --> 1:13:12.727
<i>Hi. Listen. I left you a message</i>

1:13:12.760 --> 1:13:13.904
because I was hoping
to see you before I...

1:13:13.928 --> 1:13:14.695
- <i>Josie.</i>
- I left.

1:13:14.729 --> 1:13:16.130
Ben, uh, never came

1:13:16.163 --> 1:13:17.531
<i>to school today.</i>

1:13:17.565 --> 1:13:18.976
What? Wait. Did you call
my mom and dad?

1:13:19.000 --> 1:13:20.534
No. No, I can't.

1:13:20.568 --> 1:13:22.003
You're the legal guardian.

1:13:22.036 --> 1:13:24.014
I've got to bring it to you.
It's your responsibility.

1:13:24.038 --> 1:13:25.649
- What's going on?
- Ben ditched school today.

1:13:25.673 --> 1:13:26.717
I talked to him this morning.

1:13:26.741 --> 1:13:28.209
Okay. What'd he say?

1:13:28.242 --> 1:13:29.820
He said he was embarrassed
to go to school.

1:13:29.844 --> 1:13:31.404
Did he happen to say
where he was going?

1:13:31.979 --> 1:13:33.781
Has he run away before, Delilah?

1:13:33.814 --> 1:13:35.616
Wait. Is that what this is?

1:13:35.650 --> 1:13:36.817
Ben's running away from home?

1:13:36.851 --> 1:13:38.552
Cool.

1:13:38.586 --> 1:13:39.854
No, it's not cool.

1:13:39.887 --> 1:13:41.007
He could be anywhere by now.

1:13:42.156 --> 1:13:44.558
I'm on my way.

1:13:51.032 --> 1:13:52.700
I think I know where he is.

1:13:57.872 --> 1:13:59.249
Thanks for meeting me here
so quickly.

1:13:59.273 --> 1:14:00.775
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

1:14:00.808 --> 1:14:02.743
Why do you think
Ben's hiding in my barn?

1:14:02.777 --> 1:14:04.245
The horseshoes.
He was so excited

1:14:04.278 --> 1:14:06.681
when you brought those
to the bake sale the other day.

1:14:06.714 --> 1:14:07.548
Oh, right.
Hold on, hold on, hold on.

1:14:07.581 --> 1:14:08.950
Listen.

1:14:10.651 --> 1:14:12.653
Either you're right,

1:14:12.687 --> 1:14:13.897
or my horse just started a band.

1:14:13.921 --> 1:14:15.122
Come on.

1:14:17.191 --> 1:14:18.192
There you are.

1:14:19.927 --> 1:14:21.629
Listen.

1:14:21.662 --> 1:14:22.763
Buddy...

1:14:22.797 --> 1:14:23.864
I'm not your buddy.

1:14:23.898 --> 1:14:25.199
What are you doing here?

1:14:26.934 --> 1:14:29.070
You just scared the heck
out of me.

1:14:29.103 --> 1:14:30.771
You don't ever
do that again, okay?

1:14:30.805 --> 1:14:33.574
Or you're grounded
until you're 25.

1:14:34.709 --> 1:14:37.178
That's exactly
what Mom would say.

1:14:37.211 --> 1:14:40.114
Huh.

1:14:43.918 --> 1:14:45.686
I know I've made a few mistakes.

1:14:47.989 --> 1:14:49.156
More than a few.

1:14:51.125 --> 1:14:54.628
And if you're open to it,
I'd... I'd like to apologize.

1:14:54.662 --> 1:14:56.197
It doesn't matter.

1:14:56.230 --> 1:14:58.199
Yes, it does.

1:14:58.232 --> 1:15:00.134
Ben, I love you.

1:15:00.167 --> 1:15:02.303
And I am never
gonna stop loving you.

1:15:02.336 --> 1:15:05.139
Okay? Even when I do something
that hurts your feelings.

1:15:05.172 --> 1:15:06.249
It makes me feel so embarrassed

1:15:06.273 --> 1:15:07.675
that I can't show my face
at school?

1:15:07.708 --> 1:15:09.577
Yeah, even then.

1:15:11.145 --> 1:15:14.248
Listen, I-I screwed up
when I talked to Lily, okay?

1:15:14.281 --> 1:15:15.950
I screwed up,

1:15:15.983 --> 1:15:17.627
but I did that even
because of how much I love you.

1:15:17.651 --> 1:15:18.652
Really?

1:15:18.686 --> 1:15:20.521
Yeah.

1:15:21.956 --> 1:15:24.658
Then why are you moving
back to New York?

1:15:24.692 --> 1:15:27.762
I-I don't know, Ben.

1:15:27.795 --> 1:15:30.031
I don't know. I mean, maybe...

1:15:30.064 --> 1:15:32.166
maybe you're right,
maybe this was a mistake.

1:15:32.199 --> 1:15:33.601
Aunt Josie.

1:15:33.634 --> 1:15:35.178
No, please let me finish.
This is important.

1:15:35.202 --> 1:15:36.646
- But...
- Listen. Grandma and Grandpa,

1:15:36.670 --> 1:15:37.304
- They're here...
- Aunt Josie.

1:15:37.338 --> 1:15:39.240
You're sort of bleeding...

1:15:39.273 --> 1:15:40.641
Oh, what?

1:15:42.143 --> 1:15:43.844
A lot.

1:15:43.878 --> 1:15:44.878
Oh.

1:15:47.248 --> 1:15:49.083
Yeah. I'm... I am bleeding.

1:16:03.697 --> 1:16:05.166
Dad.

1:16:05.199 --> 1:16:07.134
Jeff called me.

1:16:07.168 --> 1:16:09.904
Um, he's home with your mom
and the kids.

1:16:09.937 --> 1:16:11.172
You all right?

1:16:11.205 --> 1:16:13.307
Yeah, I'm fine.

1:16:13.340 --> 1:16:15.309
Thanks for coming to pick me up.

1:16:15.342 --> 1:16:17.144
You kiddin'? I was worried.

1:16:17.178 --> 1:16:20.714
There are so many complications
from a rusty nail...

1:16:20.748 --> 1:16:22.750
uh, tetanus,

1:16:22.783 --> 1:16:25.286
uh, lockjaw, renal failure,

1:16:25.319 --> 1:16:28.656
laryngospasm.

1:16:28.689 --> 1:16:30.257
- What?
- I was on the Internet.

1:16:31.859 --> 1:16:33.594
Dad, you don't
have to worry about me.

1:16:35.362 --> 1:16:38.365
I worry about you all the time.

1:16:38.399 --> 1:16:40.768
When you left for New York,

1:16:40.801 --> 1:16:43.671
all I could think about
was that little girl

1:16:43.704 --> 1:16:46.073
who sat on my knee
at the restaurant,

1:16:46.107 --> 1:16:48.876
living in a city so far away.

1:16:50.244 --> 1:16:52.213
Why didn't you ever
come visit me?

1:16:53.914 --> 1:16:56.317
Uh, because it's...

1:16:56.350 --> 1:16:59.787
hard to say goodbye.

1:16:59.820 --> 1:17:01.655
And every visit has an end,

1:17:01.689 --> 1:17:04.291
and I didn't want to keep
ripping off that Band-Aid,

1:17:04.325 --> 1:17:06.193
so...

1:17:06.227 --> 1:17:07.294
I avoided it.

1:17:08.729 --> 1:17:09.889
I thought you were mad at me.

1:17:10.898 --> 1:17:14.034
I was never mad at you.

1:17:14.068 --> 1:17:15.903
I just missed you.

1:17:18.139 --> 1:17:20.841
You were following your dreams.

1:17:20.875 --> 1:17:22.276
I couldn't talk you out of it.

1:17:22.309 --> 1:17:24.245
You wanted
to make your own life,

1:17:24.278 --> 1:17:27.248
and that's a good thing.

1:17:27.281 --> 1:17:30.718
Besides,
you're just as stubborn as I am.

1:17:30.751 --> 1:17:32.031
Because I learned from the best.

1:17:34.421 --> 1:17:37.825
I'm proud of you, Josie.

1:17:37.858 --> 1:17:39.393
You know that, right?

1:17:41.929 --> 1:17:43.931
I do now.

1:17:53.240 --> 1:17:56.010
I wonder if maybe
you should stay here.

1:17:57.111 --> 1:17:58.078
What?

1:17:58.112 --> 1:18:00.247
The kids need you.

1:18:00.281 --> 1:18:01.348
Your mom needs you.

1:18:01.382 --> 1:18:02.850
And...

1:18:02.883 --> 1:18:05.085
me too.

1:18:08.155 --> 1:18:09.890
I'm not saying that you have to,

1:18:09.924 --> 1:18:13.761
maybe just give it some thought.

1:18:15.763 --> 1:18:17.364
I will.

1:19:27.334 --> 1:19:29.479
I don't know why my sister
thought I could handle this,

1:19:29.503 --> 1:19:31.438
but she did.

1:19:31.472 --> 1:19:33.274
Your mom is one of
the smartest people I know,

1:19:33.307 --> 1:19:36.810
so I'm gonna trust her.

1:19:36.844 --> 1:19:39.313
I'd like to stay,
if it's okay with you guys.

1:19:41.115 --> 1:19:42.349
But here's the thing.

1:19:42.383 --> 1:19:44.051
I'm gonna make
a lot of mistakes.

1:19:44.084 --> 1:19:45.919
Like, a lot.

1:19:45.953 --> 1:19:47.855
Like, a whole lot.

1:19:47.888 --> 1:19:48.888
I know.

1:19:50.391 --> 1:19:52.751
But, guys, it's only because
I'm never going to stop trying.

1:19:53.595 --> 1:19:55.863
We get it, Aunt Josie,
and we love you.

1:19:55.896 --> 1:19:58.432
Ohh. I love you both so much.

1:19:59.967 --> 1:20:01.211
All right.
I'm gonna go make breakfast,

1:20:01.235 --> 1:20:03.337
so you guys get ready
for school, okay?

1:20:04.471 --> 1:20:05.372
Aunt Josie?

1:20:05.406 --> 1:20:07.107
Yeah?

1:20:07.141 --> 1:20:08.976
Don't talk to girls I like.

1:20:09.009 --> 1:20:10.545
Got it.

1:20:11.646 --> 1:20:13.113
Copy that.

1:20:15.617 --> 1:20:17.251
Good morning.
I'm making breakfast.

1:20:17.284 --> 1:20:18.461
And the house is still standing.

1:20:18.485 --> 1:20:19.953
That's amazing.

1:20:19.987 --> 1:20:21.488
Very funny.

1:20:22.890 --> 1:20:24.058
Hey. I have a pitch for you

1:20:24.091 --> 1:20:25.593
that I think's
gonna blow your mind.

1:20:25.627 --> 1:20:28.596
Okay. Is this gonna make me
excited or scared?

1:20:28.630 --> 1:20:31.031
Um, definitely excited.

1:20:31.065 --> 1:20:33.133
I was thinking about it and...

1:20:33.167 --> 1:20:34.935
Jeff, you should
run the restaurant for Dad.

1:20:34.968 --> 1:20:37.572
I mean, he wants to retire,
you love cooking.

1:20:37.605 --> 1:20:39.373
You would make that place fly.

1:20:39.406 --> 1:20:41.475
I mean, do you think
Dad would go for that?

1:20:41.509 --> 1:20:43.077
Yeah, absolutely.

1:20:43.110 --> 1:20:44.345
It's a win-win.

1:20:44.378 --> 1:20:46.146
Think about it.

1:20:48.550 --> 1:20:50.160
Thanks for being
so understanding, Victor.

1:20:50.184 --> 1:20:51.385
I really think I can

1:20:51.418 --> 1:20:53.420
<i>make this satellite office
work for all of us.</i>

1:20:53.454 --> 1:20:55.365
Sounds like an exciting new
market for us to cultivate.

1:20:55.389 --> 1:20:57.525
It is. And let's
let Carol run with VodaSpring.

1:20:57.559 --> 1:20:58.560
She's ready.

1:20:58.593 --> 1:21:00.094
But remind her

1:21:00.127 --> 1:21:01.505
that you can change the label
all you want...

1:21:01.529 --> 1:21:03.039
the water's always
going to taste the same.

1:21:03.063 --> 1:21:04.264
<i>Great job, Josie.</i>

1:21:07.535 --> 1:21:09.269
All right.
Bus is leaving. Here you go.

1:21:11.071 --> 1:21:13.049
Oh, Mom, you know, I can grab
the groceries on the way home.

1:21:13.073 --> 1:21:14.576
And, Dad,

1:21:14.609 --> 1:21:16.353
Jeff has some really great ideas
about the restaurant

1:21:16.377 --> 1:21:17.454
that he wants
to talk to you about.

1:21:17.478 --> 1:21:18.580
He's waiting there.

1:21:18.613 --> 1:21:20.280
All right! Let's go!

1:21:20.314 --> 1:21:22.349
Don't forget your jackets!

1:21:23.384 --> 1:21:25.018
Who was that?

1:21:28.222 --> 1:21:30.190
Here we go. Here we go.

1:21:30.224 --> 1:21:31.392
Oh, yeah. Yes!

1:21:34.395 --> 1:21:35.597
We're doing it.

1:21:35.630 --> 1:21:37.464
I'm so excited.

1:21:37.498 --> 1:21:39.142
Tell me the truth.
Did you come up with this plan?

1:21:39.166 --> 1:21:40.635
Jeff's had the talent all along.

1:21:40.668 --> 1:21:42.537
I just rebranded him.

1:21:53.981 --> 1:21:56.083
My mom got it
for her "Sweet 16,"

1:21:56.116 --> 1:21:57.317
and every time I look at it,

1:21:57.351 --> 1:21:58.962
it just reminds me
of how much I love her.

1:21:58.986 --> 1:22:00.254
Hey.

1:22:00.287 --> 1:22:02.956
Door-to-door service
with a smile.

1:22:02.990 --> 1:22:03.990
Thanks, Aunt Josie.

1:22:08.195 --> 1:22:10.164
Bye, Cooper.

1:22:21.375 --> 1:22:22.644
Josie.

1:22:22.677 --> 1:22:24.311
Wait up.

1:22:24.344 --> 1:22:25.680
Don't you have practice now?

1:22:27.214 --> 1:22:28.650
What's that? Oh, the kids? Yeah.

1:22:28.683 --> 1:22:30.484
They're stretching.

1:22:30.518 --> 1:22:33.053
They're, like, 12 going on 30.
They can handle themselves.

1:22:33.086 --> 1:22:34.522
I got a question for you.

1:22:34.556 --> 1:22:36.056
Uh, no, mm-mm.

1:22:36.089 --> 1:22:37.725
You cannot borrow my dad's van.

1:22:37.759 --> 1:22:38.760
You've already done that.

1:22:38.793 --> 1:22:40.227
Nice.

1:22:40.260 --> 1:22:41.495
It's a different question.

1:22:44.431 --> 1:22:45.999
Right, the question.

1:22:46.033 --> 1:22:48.469
Um...

1:22:48.502 --> 1:22:50.103
you're staying in town, right?

1:22:50.137 --> 1:22:51.573
Yeah.

1:22:51.606 --> 1:22:52.439
- Yeah?
- Yeah, I am.

1:22:52.473 --> 1:22:53.473
Okay.

1:22:54.709 --> 1:22:56.276
Ahem.

1:22:56.310 --> 1:22:57.590
What are you doing Friday night?

1:23:00.481 --> 1:23:02.550
Cooper Avchen,

1:23:02.584 --> 1:23:04.151
you asking me out on a date?

1:23:04.184 --> 1:23:06.253
Yes, ma'am, I am.

1:23:07.655 --> 1:23:09.657
Well, I mean, it depends.

1:23:09.691 --> 1:23:11.693
On what?

1:23:11.726 --> 1:23:13.661
You think
you can make that shot?

1:23:16.764 --> 1:23:19.166
I see what you're doing.

1:23:19.199 --> 1:23:21.034
I wake up in cold sweats, Josie.

1:23:21.068 --> 1:23:22.269
You know that?

1:23:24.238 --> 1:23:25.038
I get a date, though?

1:23:25.072 --> 1:23:26.139
Yes, sir.

1:23:26.173 --> 1:23:27.307
All right.

1:23:27.341 --> 1:23:29.243
Here we go.

1:23:31.679 --> 1:23:34.181
Tsk.

1:23:34.214 --> 1:23:35.593
Double or nothing.
You gotta let me do this.

1:23:35.617 --> 1:23:37.484
But lucky for you, I'm, um...

1:23:37.519 --> 1:23:40.187
I'm a sucker
for a guy with a whistle.

1:23:40.220 --> 1:23:41.556
Is that right?
