who really did this.

12:33.620 --> 12:35.660
[indistinct chatter]

12:45.150 --> 12:47.470
Am I gonna need to confine you
to quarters?

12:47.670 --> 12:49.900
Lieutenant Mura detected
weapon system activity,

12:50.100 --> 12:53.560
presumably targeting
Picard's unarmed shuttle.

12:53.760 --> 12:56.040
So it will be so noted
in my report.

12:56.240 --> 12:59.130
Sir, they could die
if we don't help.

12:59.330 --> 13:01.520
Did you assist Captain Riker
and Admiral Picard

13:01.720 --> 13:03.130
in commandeering my shuttle?

13:03.330 --> 13:05.830
I am more than certain
they were able to find

13:06.030 --> 13:07.830
the shuttle bay
without assistance.

13:08.030 --> 13:09.440
Bullshit.

13:11.180 --> 13:15.410
Sir, you could be the hero
who saved heroes

13:15.610 --> 13:17.500
or you could be remembered
for being the captain

13:17.700 --> 13:20.800
who let two legends die.

13:21.000 --> 13:23.620
It's your call. Sir.

13:36.070 --> 13:38.690
Okay, so we've got no visuals,

13:38.890 --> 13:42.170
we've lost our escape
and help isn't coming.

13:42.370 --> 13:43.746
- Suggestions?
- Have they hailed us?

13:43.770 --> 13:45.050
Surrendering is an option.

13:45.250 --> 13:46.480
They haven't offered terms.

13:46.680 --> 13:48.080
Well, I could offer them
you two.

13:53.220 --> 13:55.490
Does the legendary admiral
have any ideas?

13:55.690 --> 13:58.320
I'm not strategizing,
I'm safeguarding.

13:58.520 --> 14:00.400
Against what?

14:09.540 --> 14:11.380
Against that.

14:11.580 --> 14:13.590

14:14.850 --> 14:16.420

- What?

14:16.620 --> 14:18.510

you ambushed him

eye to the shady business

17:46.960 --> 17:48.680
that happens in the back room
of your bar,

17:48.880 --> 17:50.550
and I need an intro...

17:50.750 --> 17:52.550
to Sneed, the Ferengi broker.

17:52.750 --> 17:54.120
Are you out of your mind?

17:54.320 --> 17:55.640
You do realize that "broker"

17:55.840 --> 17:57.600
is just a polite word
for "gangster."

17:57.800 --> 17:59.040
He's a monster.

17:59.240 --> 18:02.090
It's important.
I wouldn't ask otherwise.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.830
I'm with Starfleet Intelligence,

- It was so easy for you.
- I made a choice.

18:27.310 --> 18:30.550
And we had this...
this beautiful boy.

18:30.750 --> 18:32.070

who can do this.

18:55.340 --> 18:57.660

18:57.860 --> 18:59.840
And I actually thought
you were here about Gabe.

19:00.040 --> 19:03.490
Thought maybe you'd want me
to put in a word with him.

19:03.690 --> 19:04.710
You'd do that?

19:04.910 --> 19:06.140
[laughs softly]

19:08.140 --> 19:09.630
I could talk to Gabe.

19:09.830 --> 19:11.420

19:11.610 --> 19:14.200

26:56.510 --> 26:58.190

what he deserves.

27:01.040 --> 27:04.140

to give Vadic her bounty

27:07.570 --> 27:09.590

give into hostile demands?

39:04.280 --> 39:06.480
Oi, Starfleet.

39:06.680 --> 39:08.430
What's the power level
of this force field?

39:09.820 --> 39:11.700
According to Starfleet
regulations,

39:11.900 --> 39:17.230
you are required to inform me
of the power level.

39:17.430 --> 39:20.710
In the event I may harm myself
whilst trying to escape.

39:20.910 --> 39:23.310
Level 10. Standard issue.

39:26.400 --> 39:29.810
Go ahead. Stick your tongue out,
test it to be sure.

39:30.010 --> 39:31.970
Thank you kindly.

39:42.070 --> 39:43.560
How's Beverly?

39:43.760 --> 39:45.340
Arterial wound.

39:45.540 --> 39:47.046
We located the internal trauma,
stopped the bleeding.

39:47.070 --> 39:48.300
She'll be all right.

39:48.500 --> 39:50.600
- How sedated is she?
- Heavily.

39:53.260 --> 39:54.440
Whoa. What are you doing?

39:54.640 --> 39:56.650
No... Sir, she needs time
to rest.

39:57.960 --> 40:00.790
This is not a diplomatic issue,
Picard.

40:00.990 --> 40:02.930
They have already engaged us.

40:03.130 --> 40:04.580
Reestablish comms.

40:04.780 --> 40:07.230
We may be able to bring her down
simply by standing up.

40:07.430 --> 40:09.180
Enemy vessel is hailing us, sir.

40:13.540 --> 40:15.410
On screen.

40:17.060 --> 40:19.120
<i>You know, it's been centuries</i>

40:19.320 --> 40:22.160
<i>since timepieces last ran
on the mechanics of gears,</i>

40:22.360 --> 40:27.430
<i>and yet,
that persistent sound you hear</i>

40:27.630 --> 40:32.520
is the gentle ticktock
of passing seconds.

40:32.720 --> 40:34.910
- We still have time.
<i>- Of course.</i>

40:35.990 --> 40:41.090
<i>And I will honor my terms.</i>

40:43.520 --> 40:47.410
But... I thought
you might care to know

40:47.610 --> 40:51.410
the name
of my particular vessel.

40:51.610 --> 40:54.450
<i>The</i> Shrike.

40:55.670 --> 40:57.420
<i>It's an Earth creature.</i>

40:57.620 --> 40:59.500
<i>A small carrion bird,</i>

40:59.700 --> 41:02.860
<i>one that doesn't attack
in anger or malice,</i>

41:03.060 --> 41:04.380
<i>one that isn't made</i>

41:04.580 --> 41:06.770
frantic by hunger

41:06.970 --> 41:11.780
but rather
kills surgically, carefully.

41:11.980 --> 41:16.040
<i>Give me the boy now
or continue to delay,</i>

41:16.240 --> 41:19.440
but with each ticking moment,

41:19.640 --> 41:23.270
<i>I will take
another piece of you.</i>

41:23.470 --> 41:26.620
I'll peck, and I'll jab

41:26.820 --> 41:29.970
at everything
that makes you you.

41:30.170 --> 41:34.190
<i>Every system that makes
your ship your ship,</i>

41:34.390 --> 41:37.850
until there's nothing left
but the choice to have given me

41:38.050 --> 41:40.800
what you could have
given me now.

41:42.450 --> 41:44.110
<i>But certainly...</i>

41:46.060 --> 41:48.760
<i>take your time.</i>

41:50.630 --> 41:55.210
That was some terrific
standing up, Admiral.

41:55.410 --> 41:58.130
All right, enough.
Let's turn him over.

41:58.330 --> 42:00.990
Sir, there's been
a security breach on Deck 12.

42:01.990 --> 42:03.210
At the brig.

42:04.430 --> 42:05.960
Find him.

42:06.160 --> 42:09.490
Shuttles, transporters,
lock 'em down.

42:09.690 --> 42:12.140

- Security alert.

42:12.340 --> 42:13.880
A prisoner has escaped the brig.

42:14.080 --> 42:17.190
<i>Use precautions.
He may be armed.</i>

42:17.390 --> 42:19.310
I don't give a damn
what rank I do or don't have,

42:19.440 --> 42:21.630
I need a tac team
to the shuttle bay ASAP.

42:21.830 --> 42:23.720

You may have just earned
your post back. Bring him up.

42:54.300 --> 42:56.236
He's currently in the
transporter bay with a phaser

42:56.260 --> 42:58.710

the controls.

PICARD:
If he was escaping,

43:00.870 --> 43:02.930
he'd be a half a system away
in a shuttle by now.

43:03.130 --> 43:04.720
And the only place he can get to

43:04.920 --> 43:06.410
with a transporter
would be there.

43:06.610 --> 43:09.200
He's trying
to hand himself over,

43:12.840 --> 43:14.380
He's protecting his mother.

43:14.580 --> 43:16.820
If that's the case,
by all means, let him.
