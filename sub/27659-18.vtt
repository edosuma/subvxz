00:00.341 --> 00:02.426
Guys! I have a great idea for a prank.

00:02.462 --> 00:03.593
Before Holt comes in,

00:03.629 --> 00:05.270
I'm gonna put ink on the podium
where he puts his hands.

00:05.306 --> 00:06.405
I don't think he'll fall for that.

00:06.440 --> 00:07.438
- I did!
- How?

00:07.474 --> 00:08.475
I haven't even opened this yet.

00:08.511 --> 00:09.482
I guess it's unrelated.

00:09.518 --> 00:11.227
Captain Holt hates pranks.
This is gonna backfire, man.

00:11.263 --> 00:13.165
Ugh, fine, I'll tone it down. I'll...

00:13.414 --> 00:14.981
move his podium a foot to the left.

00:15.016 --> 00:16.379
What? He'll be so angry.

00:16.416 --> 00:17.700
- Okay, five inches.
- Five?

00:17.736 --> 00:18.702
- Three?
- Three?

00:18.738 --> 00:19.706
- One?
- One?

00:19.742 --> 00:20.853
All right. I'll move it a half inch.

00:20.888 --> 00:22.088
Fine. It's your funeral.

00:22.123 --> 00:23.308
Oh my god.

00:24.357 --> 00:25.980
Worst prank ever. So stupid.

00:26.016 --> 00:27.596
Holt's not even going to notice.

00:27.754 --> 00:28.771
Good morning.

00:32.578 --> 00:33.711
You guys...

00:34.024 --> 00:35.385
the podium, it's...

00:36.709 --> 00:37.693
Ha.

00:44.854 --> 00:46.045
You're crazy!

00:46.080 --> 00:47.246
How did you pull this off?

01:07.351 --> 01:10.118
Yes, Kevin, they moved it
a full half inch.

01:10.203 --> 01:11.801
I'll tell you the entire story tonight.

01:11.837 --> 01:13.564
I love you as well. Goodbye.

01:14.391 --> 01:16.539
Oh, that was a fun several moments.

01:16.575 --> 01:18.326
So, there's been a series of homicides.

01:18.361 --> 01:20.228
Three victims, all young men,

01:20.263 --> 01:22.130
each murdered in their own fashion.

01:22.165 --> 01:23.365
A serial killer? How'd they do it?

01:23.400 --> 01:25.333
Strangled? Mangled? Hung, i.e. dangled?

01:25.368 --> 01:26.401
Their bodies were disfigured.

01:26.436 --> 01:27.447
I.e. "mangled." Continue.

01:27.483 --> 01:28.737
Our killer cut the victims open

01:28.772 --> 01:29.793
and ripped out their hearts.

01:29.829 --> 01:31.073
Now, before I assign this case...

01:31.108 --> 01:32.441
- Five dollars!
- What?

01:32.476 --> 01:33.842
I'm bidding for it.
I want this so badly.

01:33.877 --> 01:34.943
- That's not how we...
- $20.

01:34.978 --> 01:36.112
Just to make this interesting.

01:36.148 --> 01:38.245
- $100 for Jake to have it!
- I was going to assign

01:38.281 --> 01:40.382
the case to you and Peralta
but perhaps I should

01:40.417 --> 01:42.117
- give it to Diaz instead.
- $200!

01:42.152 --> 01:43.884
It's not about the money, Boyle!

01:43.920 --> 01:45.754
Commissioner Kelly
is breathing down my neck.

01:45.789 --> 01:48.289
I need this case handled
professionally and maturely.

01:48.324 --> 01:50.201
Name one time
I haven't acted professionally.

01:50.237 --> 01:51.259
You're holding a juice box.

01:51.294 --> 01:52.827
It stops me from spilling my juice!

01:52.862 --> 01:54.362
Look, we can handle this, sir.

01:54.397 --> 01:56.331
Do we joke around sometimes?
Yes, but when it's time

01:56.366 --> 01:57.932
to buckle down,
we're seasoned professionals.

01:57.967 --> 01:59.267
That's why they call us the Spice Boys.

01:59.302 --> 02:00.402
They don't and they won't.

02:00.437 --> 02:02.537
Sir, I swear, give us a chance.

02:02.572 --> 02:03.680
We can get this guy.

02:04.853 --> 02:06.591
Fine. Case goes to the Spice Boys.

02:06.626 --> 02:08.326
- Please don't call us that.
- Too late.

02:08.360 --> 02:09.693
Spice Boy train has left the station.

02:09.729 --> 02:10.627
Toot toot!

02:10.663 --> 02:11.996
<i>Hey, hey, check it out.</i>

02:12.031 --> 02:13.665
It's my lieutenant start paperwork!

02:13.700 --> 02:15.366
It's gonna be so weird
not calling you Sarge anymore.

02:15.402 --> 02:17.567
Maybe I'll go by Loot. "Morning, Loot!"

02:17.603 --> 02:19.537
"Loot over here." "Let's invite Loot!"

02:19.573 --> 02:20.595
What do you think?

02:22.508 --> 02:23.708
I bet you're excited about

02:23.743 --> 02:25.328
the raise that comes
with your promotion.

02:25.364 --> 02:28.011
Well, Terry doesn't like
to talk about money, but, uh...

02:28.047 --> 02:29.680
Cha-ching!

02:29.715 --> 02:31.282
Now I can pay for Showtime.

02:31.317 --> 02:32.817
Find out who or what "SMILF" is!

02:32.852 --> 02:34.452
You know, some people say,
"Mo money, mo problems,"

02:34.487 --> 02:36.087
but those people are idiots.
Money's amazing.

02:36.122 --> 02:37.133
Wait, what?

02:37.805 --> 02:38.906
This says there's not enough money

02:38.991 --> 02:40.925
in the Nine-Nine's budget for my raise!

02:40.960 --> 02:41.891
What does that mean?

02:41.927 --> 02:43.066
They're going to transfer me!

02:43.496 --> 02:44.445
_

02:45.765 --> 02:47.665
Now, I know what you're thinking.

02:48.003 --> 02:49.917
Where'd Dem guts go?

02:49.952 --> 02:50.823
Uh, yeah.

02:50.859 --> 02:52.119
This guy needs a dentist,

02:52.154 --> 02:53.888
because he's got a big ol' cavity.

02:53.923 --> 02:55.456
I love that. I'm stealing it.

02:55.491 --> 02:57.191
You cannot steal what is a gift.

02:57.226 --> 02:59.560
Thank you. Okay, so whoever did this,

02:59.595 --> 03:01.428
they weren't careful with the organs.

03:01.463 --> 03:03.898
They just sorta grabbed
whatever and yanked.

03:03.933 --> 03:06.066
Title of your sex tape.
Oh, that's just something

03:06.101 --> 03:07.224
we say back at the Nine-Nine.

03:07.260 --> 03:09.068
Interesting, 'cause around
here sex tape is what

03:09.104 --> 03:12.039
we call the adhesive you use
to reattach a severed penis.

03:12.074 --> 03:13.908
Oh, I'll have to pick some of that up.

03:13.943 --> 03:15.609
- Why?
- Anyway...

03:15.644 --> 03:18.332
most of the killer's incisions
are very sloppy

03:18.368 --> 03:21.341
but then once he gets to the heart
they become very careful.

03:21.377 --> 03:23.901
I mean, look at the vena cava.
That's a clean cut.

03:23.936 --> 03:25.235
Game recognize game.

03:25.270 --> 03:27.137
Hmm. I like your style, Doctor Cox.

03:27.172 --> 03:29.139
Gentlemen! The Commissioner would like

03:29.174 --> 03:30.407
a status update on the case.

03:30.442 --> 03:33.003
Oh, come on Ray. You make it sound like
I'm puttin' the screws to ya.

03:33.039 --> 03:34.402
No, I just popped in to say

03:34.437 --> 03:35.679
if you don't solve these
murders immediately

03:35.714 --> 03:38.060
there's gonna be some
serious consequences.

03:40.642 --> 03:42.102
I'm just messin' with ya!

03:42.137 --> 03:44.304
Listen, you know what would
help you catch this guy?

03:44.339 --> 03:46.473
I just launched a new app, HotClues.

03:46.508 --> 03:47.480
Are you familiar with it?

03:47.516 --> 03:48.745
The one that allows civilians

03:48.781 --> 03:51.311
to submit anonymous tips
directly to the NYPD?

03:51.346 --> 03:53.613
Yes, I'm familiar with... HotClues.

03:53.648 --> 03:55.315
Great! You know, it's actually

03:55.350 --> 03:57.684
helped us solve 17 cases,
so I think we should ask

03:57.719 --> 03:59.186
for the public's help with this one.

03:59.221 --> 04:01.528
No, study after study has
shown that soliciting

04:01.564 --> 04:04.458
anonymous tips results in false
leads and wrongful convictions.

04:04.643 --> 04:05.942
Hmm. Tell me how you really feel.

04:05.977 --> 04:08.411
- I did.
- And I loved it! Such passion!

04:08.446 --> 04:09.813
But I think HotClues could help us here.

04:09.848 --> 04:12.082
No, we will solve
this case the proper way

04:12.117 --> 04:15.118
with actual police work
conducted by the two best

04:15.153 --> 04:17.687
- detectives in the NYPD.
- Captain!

04:17.721 --> 04:20.194
Well, I certainly hope
your methods work.

04:20.692 --> 04:22.738
For the sake of your careers.

04:23.194 --> 04:24.289
Bye now.

04:25.403 --> 04:28.047
Oof! Now that guy's
gonna need some sex tape.

04:28.082 --> 04:30.150
'Cause someone's
gonna cut his penis off.

04:30.185 --> 04:31.711
We are vibing!

04:32.053 --> 04:33.953
So... I found out where

04:33.988 --> 04:35.355
they're transferring me.

04:35.390 --> 04:37.590
And, you know, I'm feeling
pretty good about it.

04:37.625 --> 04:39.292
Oh! Somewhere nice? Upper West Side?

04:39.327 --> 04:41.394
No, even better.

04:41.679 --> 04:43.012
Staten Island!

04:43.147 --> 04:45.781
Good one, Loot.

04:45.816 --> 04:47.984
- Where you really going?
- No, I'm serious. Staten!

04:48.019 --> 04:49.452
Wait, they're transferring
you out of New York?

04:49.487 --> 04:50.853
It's part of the City!

04:50.888 --> 04:52.655
- Is it, though?
- Hey, Staten Island is great.

04:52.690 --> 04:55.591
It's got parks, loads of bike paths,

04:55.626 --> 04:57.793
tons of up and coming restaurants...

04:57.828 --> 04:59.729
I mean... easy access to New Jersey!

04:59.764 --> 05:01.564
You're lying. Your right pec is popping

05:01.599 --> 05:03.699
all over the place.
We all know that's your tell.

05:03.734 --> 05:05.635
Of course I'm lying! It's Staten Island!

05:05.670 --> 05:07.152
The precinct is the One-Two-Two.

05:07.188 --> 05:09.588
How the hell am I supposed
to chant One-Two-Two?

05:09.623 --> 05:12.391
One-Two-Two! One-Two-Two!

05:12.426 --> 05:14.327
I sound like a damn choo-choo train!

05:14.651 --> 05:16.429
Detectives, how's the case?
Any breakthroughs?

05:16.464 --> 05:18.531
Uh, well, we're still
in the early stages.

05:18.566 --> 05:20.266
Do you have a suspect or DNA evidence?

05:20.301 --> 05:21.534
Oh my god. I wish.

05:21.570 --> 05:23.969
Look, we need to solve
this to prove to that idiot

05:24.004 --> 05:27.440
John Kelly, how inane
and useless his little app is.

05:27.475 --> 05:28.841
Oh dip. I see what's going on.

05:28.876 --> 05:31.077
- Holt is feeling petty.
- I'm not being petty.

05:31.112 --> 05:32.278
I can assure you my feelings

05:32.313 --> 05:33.713
about John Kelly
are purely professional.

05:33.998 --> 05:35.592
Are they? Because every time his name

05:35.628 --> 05:37.433
is brought up in our group text
thread you immediately send back

05:37.468 --> 05:38.734
a super catty GIF of some lady

05:38.769 --> 05:40.402
from "The Durrells in Corfu"
rolling her eyes.

05:40.437 --> 05:43.372
That's Louisa Durrell, exasperated
by the pace of life on Corfu!

05:43.407 --> 05:44.559
Wait, the group text thread is back?

05:44.595 --> 05:45.590
- No.
- We misspoke.

05:45.626 --> 05:47.092
- Yeah.
- Look, if you can't solve this case,

05:47.128 --> 05:48.728
I'll reassign it to someone who can.

05:48.764 --> 05:50.197
Wait, no, no, no, no, no!
I have an idea.

05:50.233 --> 05:52.139
We need to get into the mind of a sicko.

05:52.279 --> 05:56.411
And the only way to do that is
with the help of another sicko.

06:02.909 --> 06:04.876
Jake! It's so good to see you!

06:04.911 --> 06:06.945
Come give me a hug,
I'm not going to eat you!

06:06.980 --> 06:09.406
Also, don't hug me
'cause I will try to eat you.

06:11.134 --> 06:12.867
This is such a surprise!

06:12.903 --> 06:14.724
I haven't seen you since
I transferred here!

06:14.927 --> 06:16.227
- How's Amy?
- She's great!

06:16.263 --> 06:18.224
We're married and she's a Sergeant now.

06:18.260 --> 06:20.145
- Wow!
- Yeah! How's everything here?

06:20.181 --> 06:21.681
You know, same old same old.

06:21.716 --> 06:24.099
- Guess who's here? Herman.
- Herman!

06:24.135 --> 06:26.402
Always playing Yahtzee,
knew everybody's name.

06:26.437 --> 06:27.637
- Worshipped Satan.
- Did he?

06:27.672 --> 06:28.706
He never mentioned that.

06:30.207 --> 06:32.675
- He wouldn't shut up about it.
- It is exhausting.

06:32.710 --> 06:35.224
Well, I'm Charles.
I'm Jake's best friend.

06:35.260 --> 06:37.079
Charles, he's serving
three life sentences.

06:37.114 --> 06:38.648
No need to flex.
So Caleb, we're tracking

06:38.683 --> 06:40.677
a serial killer and I was thinking

06:41.129 --> 06:42.862
you could help us get inside his head.

06:42.898 --> 06:44.236
Just because I ate humans

06:44.271 --> 06:45.971
doesn't mean that I'm inhuman, Jake.

06:46.006 --> 06:47.373
Caleb, come on. That's not what I meant.

06:47.458 --> 06:48.691
I'm just kidding.

06:48.726 --> 06:50.559
I'm probably friends
with the guy online.

06:50.594 --> 06:51.894
What's his deal?

06:51.929 --> 06:54.427
Well, he's been murdering young men

06:54.463 --> 06:56.029
and cutting out their hearts.

06:56.065 --> 06:57.231
Ew. What?

06:57.267 --> 06:58.334
I would never eat a heart.

06:58.369 --> 06:59.670
I stick to the normal stuff.

06:59.706 --> 07:00.775
Butts and thighs.

07:00.811 --> 07:03.472
One time I ate a foot, but it was nasty.

07:03.507 --> 07:04.840
- Yeah, I can see that.
- You know what?

07:04.875 --> 07:07.209
There was some weird guy
on the forum recently.

07:07.244 --> 07:08.677
- The forum?
- Yeah, it's a chat room

07:08.712 --> 07:11.013
for people who like to talk
about eating human beings

07:11.048 --> 07:12.514
but definitely won't act on it.

07:12.749 --> 07:14.516
Wink. Yeah, it's hosted on...

07:14.551 --> 07:15.653
- Reddit.
- Obviously.

07:15.689 --> 07:18.153
Anyways, he showed up from out
of nowhere asking questions

07:18.188 --> 07:19.555
- about cutting out hearts.
- Really?

07:19.590 --> 07:20.789
Do you know anything else about him?

07:20.824 --> 07:22.027
I'd never seen him on there before

07:22.063 --> 07:24.153
but you could check the logs.
I'll approve you.

07:24.289 --> 07:25.655
- I'm an admin.
- Ah.

07:25.691 --> 07:27.458
Oh, you might want to switch
to incognito mode.

07:27.494 --> 07:31.200
Otherwise your targeted ads will
be pretty cannibal-specific.

07:31.286 --> 07:32.321
Ah, good to know.

07:32.357 --> 07:33.857
Well, it was good to see you, Caleb.

07:33.893 --> 07:34.996
Send me that info.

07:38.053 --> 07:40.092
Hey Terry, you okay?
You skipped all your lunches.

07:40.127 --> 07:42.060
I'm going through the budget
to see if there's any way

07:42.095 --> 07:43.829
we could save enough money
for me to stay here.

07:43.864 --> 07:45.731
- You find anything yet?
- Yeah, we could

07:45.766 --> 07:49.434
switch to generic printer ink,
cut down on custodial services,

07:49.469 --> 07:51.336
and stop buying office birthday cakes.

07:51.371 --> 07:53.572
- Over my dead body!
- It's just an idea.

07:53.607 --> 07:55.707
- Well, take it off the table!
- Damn, Scully, fine.

07:55.742 --> 07:57.209
We could stop paying
for an exterminator.

07:57.244 --> 07:58.331
It's pointless. We all have guns.

07:58.367 --> 07:59.385
Who am I kidding?

07:59.708 --> 08:01.596
We'll never save enough
to keep me at the Nine-Nine.

08:01.631 --> 08:03.331
You're right. The only way to free up

08:03.366 --> 08:05.066
that money is if you fire someone.

08:05.151 --> 08:07.919
What? I can't just fire
someone without cause.

08:08.054 --> 08:11.222
Come on. We all know there's a
bunch of dead weight around here.

08:11.257 --> 08:13.858
Sloppy paperwork, penmanship fails,

08:13.943 --> 08:16.144
phone etiquette that
makes me want to barf.

08:16.179 --> 08:17.479
Let's axe a dud!

08:17.514 --> 08:19.748
Damn, Amy.
I am loving this shade on you.

08:19.933 --> 08:21.399
But Loot's right.
We can't just fire somebody.

08:21.434 --> 08:24.461
That said, you could
"inspire" somebody to quit.

08:24.820 --> 08:26.552
For example, Broadway Brian.

08:27.025 --> 08:29.374
Yes! Broadway Brian, of course!

08:29.409 --> 08:30.975
Who the hell is Broadway Brian?

08:31.010 --> 08:32.043
Brian in records.

08:32.078 --> 08:34.812
He's always talking about
what a great singer he is

08:34.847 --> 08:36.948
and how his dream is to be in musicals.

08:37.359 --> 08:39.784
You just need to convince him
to go for his dream.

08:39.818 --> 08:41.953
Oh, I don't know.
That feels underhanded.

08:41.988 --> 08:44.024
It's never underhanded to help
somebody follow their dream.

08:44.059 --> 08:45.089
Yesterday, I was watching "Ellen,"

08:45.124 --> 08:46.924
and she had this woman on
who wanted to be a chef,

08:46.959 --> 08:48.593
but she didn't have any taste
buds, so she quit her job,

08:48.628 --> 08:50.061
hired her best friend
to be her taste tester.

08:50.096 --> 08:51.562
And now they have the best taco
truck in Lansing.

08:51.597 --> 08:52.930
It was inspiration as [bleep].

08:53.199 --> 08:54.233
Yeah.

08:54.488 --> 08:56.254
I'd just be helping him
follow his dream!

08:56.289 --> 08:57.856
I'd be doing him a favor!

08:57.892 --> 09:01.174
I'm going to inspire Brian's
ass right out of this office!

09:01.561 --> 09:02.860
For him, not me.

09:02.896 --> 09:04.943
Dreams, and whatnot, you know.

09:05.291 --> 09:07.333
Detectives, Commissioner Kelly is back

09:07.369 --> 09:08.996
and he found his way here on his own

09:09.031 --> 09:10.491
without any tips from the public.

09:10.527 --> 09:12.594
- How impressive is that?
- Well, thank you, Raymond.

09:12.630 --> 09:13.924
I just happened to be
in the neighborhood.

09:13.960 --> 09:15.559
Thought I'd check on your progress.

09:15.754 --> 09:17.855
Um, we have a solid lead.

09:17.890 --> 09:19.523
Suspicious online behavior

09:19.558 --> 09:21.692
from someone using the name Jamburger77.

09:21.727 --> 09:23.527
There's only one person
in the tri-state area

09:23.562 --> 09:25.296
with that surname... Eileen Jamburger.

09:25.481 --> 09:28.482
101 years old, and immediately
racist on the phone.

09:28.517 --> 09:29.984
She is not a suspect at this time.

09:30.019 --> 09:32.219
But the user did make
one non-cannibal post.

09:32.254 --> 09:35.766
A negative review of the
headroom in a 2006 Saturn Ion.

09:35.802 --> 09:36.902
Real creep car.

09:36.938 --> 09:39.539
So, we pulled records
on every 2006 Ion in the city

09:39.575 --> 09:40.883
and we're following up on them now.

09:40.919 --> 09:42.185
Well, I'll be.

09:42.221 --> 09:44.163
That's some nice police work, Peralta.

09:44.199 --> 09:45.733
- And Charles.
- I especially like how

09:45.768 --> 09:47.378
you found evidence, followed up on it,

09:47.414 --> 09:49.215
and it's lead you closer to a solve.

09:49.405 --> 09:51.238
No, I agree, Peralta.
It's excellent work.

09:51.273 --> 09:52.587
You must've hated saying that.

09:52.773 --> 09:54.958
No, I didn't. I like giving compliments.

09:54.993 --> 09:57.761
You have a nice deep voice.
It is very commanding.

09:57.796 --> 10:00.564
Cut the crap, John. You're furious!

10:00.599 --> 10:01.940
And everyone can tell!

10:03.080 --> 10:05.533
See? Very commanding.

10:05.569 --> 10:08.705
So, I know Raymond has
some issues with HotClues,

10:08.740 --> 10:10.674
but we did put the call out on the app

10:10.709 --> 10:12.843
and got a very promising tip.

10:12.878 --> 10:14.745
Look, we're not going
against our Captain.

10:14.780 --> 10:18.295
So this guy says
he saw someone covered in blood

10:18.331 --> 10:20.065
getting out of a Saturn Ion.

10:20.273 --> 10:21.773
But you don't need that tip

10:21.809 --> 10:25.177
because you are among the
best detectives in the NYPD!

10:27.025 --> 10:30.560
You're right, we don't need that tip!

10:30.595 --> 10:32.476
But seriously, send us that tip.
We need it.

10:33.308 --> 10:34.875
Hey, Brian! What are you up to?

10:35.028 --> 10:36.795
Typing in numbers into a computer.

10:36.885 --> 10:39.452
Like I always do endlessly
for 40-60 hours a week.

10:39.487 --> 10:41.890
Well, when you love what you do,
you don't work a day in your life!

10:42.424 --> 10:44.891
Unless, do you not love sad data entry?

10:44.926 --> 10:46.660
Well, my passion is performing.

10:46.695 --> 10:48.028
I do musical theater.

10:48.063 --> 10:50.079
- It's the hardest form of acting.
- I agree!

10:50.115 --> 10:52.515
I am always saying,
if you're not singing,

10:52.550 --> 10:53.912
- you're not acting.
- Right!

10:54.160 --> 10:55.851
It's probably hard to audition

10:55.887 --> 10:57.520
because you're always here, right?

10:57.555 --> 11:00.690
Yes! I had to pass up a chance
to read for "Seussical."

11:00.775 --> 11:02.542
You know Brian, this makes me think

11:02.577 --> 11:03.877
of something I saw on "Ellen."

11:03.912 --> 11:06.513
There was this lady,
she wanted to be a cook,

11:06.548 --> 11:08.314
but her tongue was all messed up,

11:08.349 --> 11:11.451
and she had this friend
who didn't even have a tongue...

11:11.486 --> 11:12.660
I mean, she did,

11:12.696 --> 11:16.197
and now they own a taco truck
in Lansing!

11:16.706 --> 11:17.773
Huh?

11:17.859 --> 11:19.225
Follow your dreams, man!

11:19.260 --> 11:20.660
You gotta follow your dreams.

11:20.695 --> 11:22.267
Find your taco truck!

11:23.030 --> 11:25.288
Wow. Thank you.

11:25.454 --> 11:27.082
That gives me a lot to think about.

11:27.668 --> 11:28.968
So what did you come down here for?

11:29.003 --> 11:33.225
Oh, uh, I had to borrow...

11:33.261 --> 11:34.561
the water cooler!

11:34.909 --> 11:36.809
All right. Thanks, Brian.

11:36.944 --> 11:38.265
Think about what I said.

11:38.646 --> 11:41.514
So, the tipster saw
the Saturn parked out back

11:41.549 --> 11:42.782
and the woman at the desk said

11:42.817 --> 11:44.250
it belongs to the man in room 203.

11:44.285 --> 11:46.886
- One "Larry Bird."
- Obvious fake name.

11:46.921 --> 11:48.888
Or is it so insane that
there's no way it's fake?

11:48.923 --> 11:50.456
If you're trying not to draw attention,

11:50.491 --> 11:51.775
why not go with something
like "John Smith?"

11:51.811 --> 11:52.959
From "Pocahontas"?

11:53.094 --> 11:55.227
Uh, yeah. Way to fly under the radar.

11:55.963 --> 11:57.786
Excuse me, is there ice yet?

11:57.822 --> 11:59.297
Oh, I'm sorry. I don't work here.

11:59.333 --> 12:00.645
I'm a police officer.

12:00.681 --> 12:02.306
Well, then I'd like
to lodge a formal complaint.

12:02.342 --> 12:03.867
There hasn't been ice here for days

12:03.903 --> 12:05.770
and everyone knows
my wine coolers are supposed

12:05.806 --> 12:07.339
- to be served chilled.
- You're an adult.

12:07.375 --> 12:08.563
Why are you drinking wine coolers?

12:08.599 --> 12:10.358
- Because I'm on vacation.
- Okay.

12:10.544 --> 12:12.478
Well, I'll mention the ice.

12:12.514 --> 12:13.980
Thanks. Pig.

12:14.016 --> 12:15.083
Okay.

12:17.684 --> 12:19.018
Oh, it's Holt.

12:19.053 --> 12:19.985
I didn't tell him what we were doing.

12:20.020 --> 12:21.042
I'll act natural.

12:21.078 --> 12:22.512
You're not gonna be on the phone call.
Just do nothing.

12:22.548 --> 12:23.658
Hey, Captain!

12:23.694 --> 12:25.228
What delicious water I'm drinking!

12:25.676 --> 12:27.376
Sorry that we didn't
check in before we left.

12:27.411 --> 12:28.944
We're just down at the DMV following up

12:28.979 --> 12:30.378
- on the Saturn owners.
- Lies!

12:30.414 --> 12:32.347
Captain! How'd you know we were here?

12:32.383 --> 12:33.333
I followed you!

12:33.369 --> 12:35.143
John Kelly gave you
a "Hot Clue," didn't he?

12:35.179 --> 12:36.852
How dare you disobey me.

12:36.887 --> 12:38.187
Come on, sir, it was a good tip

12:38.222 --> 12:39.588
and we're trying
to catch a serial killer.

12:39.623 --> 12:40.767
Well then let's see this tip,

12:40.803 --> 12:42.903
this groundbreaking tip

12:42.939 --> 12:44.439
that threatens
to blow the case wide open.

12:44.475 --> 12:46.709
Okay, I know this tone.
Here comes petty Holt.

12:46.745 --> 12:47.878
Naw, bitch. I'm not being petty.

12:47.914 --> 12:49.213
You just said, "naw, bitch."

12:49.249 --> 12:51.116
Show me the tip.

12:51.152 --> 12:52.552
Title of your sex tape.

12:52.968 --> 12:54.653
<i>I was behind the Royal Motor Inn.</i>

12:54.688 --> 12:57.489
<i>I saw a guy get out of a blue Saturn Ion</i>

12:57.524 --> 12:58.720
<i>and he was covered in blood.</i>

12:58.756 --> 13:00.225
<i>Anyway, Baba Booey!</i>

13:00.260 --> 13:02.160
Baba Booey? Is that a clue?

13:02.195 --> 13:04.296
Uh, I don't know what
Baba Booey means, actually.

13:04.331 --> 13:06.665
It's a popular prank phrase
from Howard Stern.

13:06.800 --> 13:09.034
- Charles!
- Oh, from a shock jock.

13:09.069 --> 13:10.335
Well, that changes everything.

13:10.370 --> 13:13.032
Now we have
a credible break in the case.

13:13.068 --> 13:14.209
Baba Booey!

13:14.593 --> 13:16.293
NYPD, open up!

13:16.329 --> 13:17.776
<i>Uh, just a minute!</i>

13:17.811 --> 13:20.045
Ooh, I bet he's frantically packing up

13:20.080 --> 13:21.446
his collection of hearts.

13:22.983 --> 13:24.477
Goin' in! Get back.

13:26.037 --> 13:28.104
- There's blood everywhere!
- He went out the window.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.298
I'll go around back.

13:30.457 --> 13:32.724
Fine, Kelly found the
murderer's kill room.

13:32.759 --> 13:34.726
Whoop-Dee-doo!
Should we throw him a parade?

13:34.761 --> 13:36.532
Yeah! Maybe!

13:38.606 --> 13:40.074
Patrols have searched
a five-block radius.

13:40.109 --> 13:41.288
No sign of the perp.

13:41.324 --> 13:43.210
And there were no prints.
He was wearing gloves.

13:43.245 --> 13:44.878
- Like the inimitable Audrey Hepburn.
- Nope.

13:44.914 --> 13:46.282
Gentlemen, there's something
I need to say.

13:46.318 --> 13:47.710
I gave you such a hard time

13:47.746 --> 13:50.917
about using Commissioner Kelly's
app because I was being petty.

13:50.953 --> 13:53.187
I wanted him to fail
and I took it out on you

13:53.222 --> 13:55.700
and for that I am very...

13:58.392 --> 14:00.414
Oh. You kind of trailed off there, sir.

14:00.450 --> 14:01.647
Were you going to finish your sentence?

14:01.683 --> 14:02.834
It felt like you were going
to say you were sorry.

14:02.870 --> 14:04.165
I did. Boyle heard it.

14:04.200 --> 14:05.933
Uh, I would remember if
someone said my catch phrase.

14:05.968 --> 14:08.035
Fine, I'm sorry.

14:08.070 --> 14:10.071
I'm very sorry.

14:10.106 --> 14:12.039
Apology accepted.

14:12.174 --> 14:14.341
- I am so proud of you.
- Peralta.

14:14.376 --> 14:15.643
You're right. I'll rub it in later.

14:15.678 --> 14:17.178
What matters now is solving this case.

14:17.213 --> 14:18.646
Now, our murderer may have gotten away,

14:18.681 --> 14:20.548
but we did find his kill room.

14:20.583 --> 14:22.383
Maybe there's something in here
that we're not seeing, yet.

14:22.418 --> 14:24.318
Perhaps we should pay your
cannibal friend another visit.

14:24.353 --> 14:27.054
I wouldn't say they're friends
so much as ex-cellmates.

14:27.089 --> 14:28.722
No, it's true. We're friends.

14:28.757 --> 14:31.632
- He ate kids!
- Well, people are complicated.

14:31.894 --> 14:33.060
Now, I'll tell you one thing.

14:33.095 --> 14:34.528
You are not looking for a cannibal.

14:34.563 --> 14:36.330
- Why do you say that?
- With all that blood?

14:36.365 --> 14:39.166
No self-respecting cannibal
would waste all that sauce.

14:39.201 --> 14:40.668
See, Charles? He's a foodie, like you.

14:40.703 --> 14:42.885
- Who are you?
- Can I see that picture again?

14:43.042 --> 14:45.076
Oh man, those are some nice tools.

14:45.112 --> 14:46.745
I would love to spread some ribs

14:46.781 --> 14:48.114
using that sternum retractor,

14:48.150 --> 14:49.508
but they only sell those to hospitals.

14:49.544 --> 14:51.411
Wait a minute. What did you just say?

14:51.447 --> 14:53.514
I said I'd love to get my little fingies

14:53.549 --> 14:54.448
in some chesties.

14:54.483 --> 14:56.217
No, no, no. Not the super gross part.

14:56.252 --> 14:57.418
Surgery-grade tools,

14:57.453 --> 14:58.586
precise incisions around the heart,

14:58.621 --> 15:00.321
and there was no ice at the motel.

15:00.356 --> 15:02.223
Because the perp was using
it for the hearts.

15:02.258 --> 15:04.225
We're not looking for a serial killer.

15:04.260 --> 15:06.093
He stole the hearts for a transplant!

15:06.128 --> 15:07.528
Boom! We solved it.

15:07.563 --> 15:09.864
- Boyle, give me a hug.
- Yeah!

15:09.899 --> 15:12.432
No!

15:12.902 --> 15:14.103
Hey, I did it!

15:14.139 --> 15:16.437
I talked to Brian and encouraged
him to pursue his dreams.

15:16.472 --> 15:17.938
Really? Is he gonna quit?

15:17.973 --> 15:19.540
I don't know, that was the first step.

15:19.575 --> 15:21.408
But I figure
if I talk to him twice a day

15:21.443 --> 15:23.410
- for the next few weeks...
<i>- Attention, everyone!</i>

15:23.445 --> 15:25.546
Today will be my final day
at the Nine-Nine.

15:25.581 --> 15:27.214
Damn, Loot. That was fast.

15:27.249 --> 15:28.716
I will be taking my talents to Broadway

15:28.751 --> 15:30.718
and I owe it all
to Lieutenant Terry Jeffords.

15:30.753 --> 15:32.386
All I did was believe in you.

15:32.421 --> 15:33.687
And it changed everything.

15:33.722 --> 15:36.090
So Lieutenant, this one's for you.

15:36.125 --> 15:37.145
Oh.

15:56.779 --> 15:58.712
The federal heart
transplant waiting list.

15:58.747 --> 16:01.315
Check out who's all the way
down at 2,319.

16:01.350 --> 16:04.485
Angelo Rinaldi, who runs
the Rinaldi crime family.

16:04.800 --> 16:07.121
Well. Then let's pay him a visit.

16:08.524 --> 16:10.565
- NYPD!
- Hands where we can see them!

16:10.850 --> 16:12.450
There's a heart in the cooler.

16:12.486 --> 16:15.020
Sorry, Rinaldi, the only
transplant happening today

16:15.056 --> 16:16.556
is your ass to jail.

16:16.592 --> 16:18.225
He is definitely unconscious
and didn't hear any of that.

16:18.261 --> 16:20.064
But I'm still pumped.
Case closed. Let's go!

16:20.469 --> 16:22.836
So Rinaldi had his
trigger-man stealing hearts

16:22.871 --> 16:25.072
so he could have a transplant.

16:25.107 --> 16:27.174
That is fun! Good job, Ray.

16:27.209 --> 16:28.509
Thank you, Commissioner Kelly.

16:28.544 --> 16:30.104
We couldn't have done it without your...

16:31.909 --> 16:33.941
Sir, you're doing
the trailing off thing again.

16:34.350 --> 16:37.017
Help. Um... and I owe you an apology.

16:37.052 --> 16:39.753
I'm sorry and I must admit,

16:39.788 --> 16:42.105
you've really got something
on your hands with this...

16:42.858 --> 16:44.291
HotClues app.

16:44.326 --> 16:45.960
Well, that is so nice of you to say.

16:45.995 --> 16:47.962
But, if you like the app now,

16:47.997 --> 16:50.698
wait until you see
the updates we're rolling out.

16:50.733 --> 16:53.434

Baba Booey.

17:10.653 --> 17:12.429
You're the guy from the video.

17:12.839 --> 17:14.172
You called in the tip.

17:14.208 --> 17:15.374
Yeah.

17:15.557 --> 17:17.324
Ah, Micah, do me a favor.

17:18.888 --> 17:19.989
Nobody in or out.

17:20.025 --> 17:21.625
Lock the doors. Thanks, bud.

17:21.661 --> 17:23.194
Actually Micah, you wanna
leave that door unlocked

17:23.230 --> 17:24.596
in case we want to make a quick getaway?

17:24.632 --> 17:26.098
I'm gonna do what he told me to do.

17:26.135 --> 17:28.726
Yeah, that makes sense. Thanks, bud.

17:29.955 --> 17:31.155
What's going on, Kelly?

17:31.191 --> 17:34.193
Why is your assistant submitting tips?

17:34.640 --> 17:36.511
Because they already
had the information.

17:36.711 --> 17:38.345
The tips aren't coming
from the public at all.

17:38.380 --> 17:39.409
Oh, cool theory.

17:39.445 --> 17:40.822
But if I already had the information,

17:40.858 --> 17:43.631
why am I pouring so much money
into developing this app?

17:43.667 --> 17:45.100
To hide where you're getting it.

17:45.135 --> 17:47.022
Because you're using
illegal wiretaps or something!

17:47.838 --> 17:50.439
You got me! You guys are good!

17:50.474 --> 17:52.808
I just love how you ping pong
off each other.

17:52.843 --> 17:55.143
This is blatantly unconstitutional.

17:55.178 --> 17:56.945
- I'm going to the press!
- Yes, you should.

17:56.980 --> 17:59.648
But first, do you know
what a stingray is?

17:59.683 --> 18:01.113
Of course we know what a Stingray is.

18:01.149 --> 18:02.317
Tenderest meat in the ocean!

18:02.402 --> 18:04.336
No, stingray is a portable cell tower.

18:04.371 --> 18:05.697
You drive it around the city.

18:05.733 --> 18:08.172
It captures data from any
cell phone within reach.

18:08.208 --> 18:12.344
Like, oh, text messages,
location history, voicemail...

18:12.379 --> 18:13.568
Oh my god.

18:13.747 --> 18:15.347
You have a "Dark Knight" machine!

18:15.382 --> 18:17.015
Yes, I do, and the three of you

18:17.050 --> 18:18.553
are not going to say a word about it

18:18.589 --> 18:20.089
because the 18 felons

18:20.125 --> 18:22.887
we captured through the system,
they'd go free.

18:22.923 --> 18:24.389
That's unfortunate, but it's better

18:24.424 --> 18:25.591
than living in a police state.

18:25.626 --> 18:27.292
- I'm not sitting on this.
- Okay.

18:27.327 --> 18:29.695
But I can assure you, you can't
prove this program exists.

18:29.730 --> 18:31.263
It's just your word against mine.

18:31.298 --> 18:33.198
- I'm more than fine with that.
- You shouldn't be.

18:33.233 --> 18:36.034
Because I can prove you'd do
anything to sabotage me.

18:36.069 --> 18:39.037
My stingray captured your texts, too.

18:39.072 --> 18:41.373
No, he has the "Durrells in Corfu" GIF!

18:41.408 --> 18:43.241
Oh-ho-ho. Way worse.

18:43.276 --> 18:44.943
You wrote several people,

18:44.978 --> 18:48.075
"I would do anything
to rid the NYPD of John Kelly.

18:48.111 --> 18:49.611
"Sincerely, Raymond Holt."

18:49.647 --> 18:52.404

18:55.622 --> 18:56.722
I can't let him quit his job!

18:56.757 --> 18:58.290
He'll never get cast in anything.

18:58.325 --> 18:59.958
Maybe he'll be one
of those people on "The Voice"

18:59.993 --> 19:01.727
that's so bad they become
an Internet sensation.

19:01.762 --> 19:03.562
That's not what they do
on "The Voice", Amy,

19:03.597 --> 19:04.997
that's "American Idol"!

19:05.032 --> 19:06.782
"The Voice" is purely
a celebration of talent.

19:06.818 --> 19:08.619
If he wants to pursue his
dream and it doesn't work out,

19:08.655 --> 19:10.955
that's not on you. He made his choice.

19:10.991 --> 19:13.325
Yeah, yeah, you're right.
You know, no blood on my hands.

19:13.473 --> 19:14.740
I just need to let him do his thing.

19:14.775 --> 19:17.476

- Hey, Brian!

19:17.511 --> 19:20.211
So, what did you think of my song?

19:22.015 --> 19:24.249
- I loved how loud it was.
- Thank you.

19:24.284 --> 19:26.652
I wouldn't have had the courage
to do it without you.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.186
Sure, I daydream about it all the time,

19:28.221 --> 19:30.288
but being a single dad,
I always chickened out.

19:30.323 --> 19:31.923
You... have... a kid?

19:31.958 --> 19:33.992
