you've seen the light.

40:18.833 --> 40:21.250
I want to talk to <i> el jefe.</i>

40:21.252 --> 40:23.252
- He's in <i> México.</i>
- I know.

40:23.254 --> 40:25.254
I need you to set up a meeting.

40:25.256 --> 40:26.538
I want to make a deal.

40:28.175 --> 40:29.508
What kind of deal?

40:29.510 --> 40:32.094
[Sighs] I want my freedom.

40:32.096 --> 40:35.264
I don't <i> ever</i> want to work
for the cartel again.

40:35.266 --> 40:36.715
[Chuckles]

40:36.717 --> 40:39.718
[Laughs]

40:39.720 --> 40:43.439
You're a fool if you think
he'll agree to that.

40:43.441 --> 40:47.309
But I can give him
something he desperately wants.

40:47.311 --> 40:48.610
And what is that?

40:48.612 --> 40:52.364
Tell him...

40:52.366 --> 40:55.617
I found the little girl
he's been looking for.
