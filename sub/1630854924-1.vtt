42:52.894 --> 42:54.993
is that it assumes
that everyone is an idiot

42:55.028 --> 42:56.962
and that they're all incapable
of saving themselves.

42:56.997 --> 42:58.700
I think they got
something right with that.

42:58.735 --> 42:59.866
I don't think like that...

42:59.901 --> 43:01.736
What I don't like
about religion

43:01.771 --> 43:04.200
is that when people
accept Jesus or whatever,

43:04.235 --> 43:05.872
they suddenly think
that they're better

43:05.907 --> 43:06.973
than everyone else.

that they're stupid sinners,

43:09.207 --> 43:12.406

and they turn into assholes.

what to say.

of clues in Scripture

43:59.356 --> 44:00.522
that suggest it's imminent.

we don't have time
to deny the Gospel,

44:02.964 --> 44:04.128

Do you really think

44:04.163 --> 44:06.361
that the world's
gonna end soon?

44:15.372 --> 44:18.010
that a better world is coming
to replace this one.

That everything terrible
about this country,

want to come home

to get married.

52:15.654 --> 52:17.423

into getting married

he met someone else.

52:24.432 --> 52:26.432
Fell in love,
started a whole new life.

52:26.467 --> 52:29.501

of the church.

stopped sleeping,
stopped eating.

52:45.816 --> 52:46.947

Alan's death was...

going to be dead,

is for you to leave him alone.

I heard you the first time.

1:08:32.564 --> 1:08:33.563
Do you find me attractive?

1:08:34.401 --> 1:08:35.598
(HESITATES)

1:08:35.633 --> 1:08:37.534
Because I'm not attracted
to you at all,

1:08:38.306 --> 1:08:40.240
just to let you know.

1:08:40.275 --> 1:08:41.439
I'm not trying to be mean
or anything.

1:08:41.474 --> 1:08:42.770
I just don't think
you're very good-looking,

1:08:43.740 --> 1:08:44.772
or interesting.

1:08:45.511 --> 1:08:46.510
Or intelligent.

1:08:46.809 --> 1:08:47.874
(SCOFFS)

1:08:48.943 --> 1:08:50.382
Oh, my God, grow up.

1:08:50.417 --> 1:08:51.713
Maybe someone else
finds you attractive.

1:08:51.748 --> 1:08:52.714
Maybe my dad
finds you attractive.

1:08:52.749 --> 1:08:54.815
I really wish you...
You know, it is so easy

1:08:54.850 --> 1:08:55.882
to make you uncomfortable.

1:08:55.917 --> 1:08:57.554
It's honestly...
It's a little sad.

1:08:58.458 --> 1:08:59.457
You can cash that out.

1:09:13.539 --> 1:09:16.441
(SCOFFS) If my parents knew
I was getting high,

1:09:16.476 --> 1:09:17.871
getting high while out
witnessing for the church...

1:09:17.906 --> 1:09:18.905
You're not from New Life.

1:09:20.711 --> 1:09:21.777
What?

1:09:21.812 --> 1:09:24.614
There's a kid in the grade
below me who goes there.

1:09:24.649 --> 1:09:25.747
He told me
that they stopped doing

1:09:25.782 --> 1:09:27.617
door-to-door stuff last year

1:09:27.652 --> 1:09:29.850
when some woman
was out preaching
or whatever,

1:09:29.885 --> 1:09:31.984
and a guy answered the door
with no clothes on.

1:09:33.427 --> 1:09:35.427
I gotta go.
Who are you, really?

1:09:36.958 --> 1:09:38.430
Come on, just tell me!

1:09:39.664 --> 1:09:41.466
THOMAS: Why do you care?
Because I think we have

1:09:41.501 --> 1:09:42.698
a blossoming friendship.

1:09:44.405 --> 1:09:45.569
You're just messing with me.

1:09:46.968 --> 1:09:48.275
ELLIE: No, I'm not.

1:09:49.476 --> 1:09:50.607
You're not going
to tell anyone?

1:09:52.347 --> 1:09:53.346
Who am I gonna tell?

1:10:01.620 --> 1:10:02.685
I was on a mission.

1:10:06.394 --> 1:10:08.394
With a group from my church,
back in Waterloo,

1:10:09.628 --> 1:10:10.891
my hometown in Iowa.

1:10:12.367 --> 1:10:13.894
When my dad
caught me smoking pot,

1:10:13.929 --> 1:10:16.600
he thought a mission
would be a good idea.

1:10:16.635 --> 1:10:19.735
I mean, the truth is,
he's just embarrassed by me

1:10:19.770 --> 1:10:21.968
and wanted me gone
for a while.

1:10:22.839 --> 1:10:24.971
Anyway, I just left.

1:10:28.416 --> 1:10:29.514
I couldn't do it anymore.

1:10:31.551 --> 1:10:32.550
Why?

1:10:33.685 --> 1:10:34.717
The mission leader,

1:10:36.523 --> 1:10:37.489
this guy, Jerry,

1:10:37.524 --> 1:10:39.084
all he had us doing
was standing on corners

1:10:39.119 --> 1:10:41.053
and handing out pamphlets.

1:10:41.088 --> 1:10:42.527
The end of each day,
he'd be like,

1:10:42.562 --> 1:10:44.056
"Look how many people
we're helping," but...

1:10:44.927 --> 1:10:45.992
I tried to talk to him

1:10:46.027 --> 1:10:47.393
about different ways
we can minister.

1:10:47.429 --> 1:10:50.733
I mean, different ways
that we could actually
help people. But...

1:10:52.033 --> 1:10:54.506
You could just tell
that he didn't need to earn

1:10:54.541 --> 1:10:55.903
or prove his faith at all.

1:10:59.040 --> 1:11:02.514
After a while,
I was just, like,
"Am I really helping?"

1:11:03.748 --> 1:11:05.583
No. You were not.

1:11:07.147 --> 1:11:08.817
Yeah, I started to feel
that way, too.

1:11:10.854 --> 1:11:11.753
I don't feel that way,

1:11:11.789 --> 1:11:14.053
I know that you weren't
helping people.

1:11:14.088 --> 1:11:15.461
It doesn't help people
to tell them

1:11:15.496 --> 1:11:16.693
that they should believe
in God.

1:11:16.728 --> 1:11:17.793
Why would that help people?

1:11:18.796 --> 1:11:20.565
THOMAS: I just thought...

1:11:20.600 --> 1:11:22.534
I see all my family,
my friends,

1:11:24.065 --> 1:11:25.471
they're all just so happy.

1:11:30.511 --> 1:11:31.708
I just want to be like that.

1:11:33.943 --> 1:11:35.008
So, why'd you leave, then?

1:11:36.715 --> 1:11:39.078
I was worried
I was gonna get arrested.

1:11:40.015 --> 1:11:41.014
For smoking pot?

1:11:42.721 --> 1:11:43.918
For stealing from the mission.

1:11:51.961 --> 1:11:54.896
One day,
I ditched the pamphlets.

1:11:54.931 --> 1:11:55.830
I went door-to-door.

1:11:55.866 --> 1:11:57.833
I started actually
engaging with people.

1:11:57.868 --> 1:12:00.737
Finally. I mean, it felt
like I was doing something,

1:12:00.772 --> 1:12:01.837
helping someone.

1:12:03.610 --> 1:12:05.544
(SCOFFS)

1:12:05.579 --> 1:12:08.514
And that night, I went back
to the mission meeting,

1:12:08.549 --> 1:12:09.977
and I told everyone
what I did that day,

1:12:10.012 --> 1:12:11.913
and Jerry was like,
"That's not
what we do, buddy."

1:12:11.948 --> 1:12:13.248
And I was like,
"Well, why not?"

1:12:13.283 --> 1:12:15.521
And we got
in this huge argument
in front of everyone, and...

1:12:16.788 --> 1:12:17.820
(SIGHS)

1:12:20.462 --> 1:12:23.628
And that night,
I decided to leave.

1:12:23.663 --> 1:12:25.696
And when everyone
was asleep, I...

1:12:25.731 --> 1:12:26.829
I took the petty cash.

1:12:28.800 --> 1:12:29.865
ELLIE: How much?

1:12:33.508 --> 1:12:35.541
$2,436.

1:12:37.743 --> 1:12:39.072
Oh.

1:12:39.107 --> 1:12:40.480
THOMAS: Yeah. "Oh."

1:12:42.517 --> 1:12:43.316
I got on a bus.

1:12:44.816 --> 1:12:46.684
Jerry and my parents
were calling me

1:12:46.719 --> 1:12:47.949
over and over again.

1:12:49.722 --> 1:12:51.084
I just tossed my phone.

1:12:53.759 --> 1:12:56.529
After a while,
I wound up here.

1:13:00.667 --> 1:13:02.601
THOMAS: I thought
I could use this money

1:13:02.636 --> 1:13:03.767
for my own mission.

1:13:05.573 --> 1:13:08.134
You know, see my faith save
just one person.

1:13:09.874 --> 1:13:11.907
But now I'm almost
out of money. I just...

1:13:13.273 --> 1:13:15.548
I can't go home, and...

1:13:15.583 --> 1:13:17.110
My parents probably
wanna disown me.

1:13:22.953 --> 1:13:24.117
(SIGHS) I don't know
what to do.

1:13:35.064 --> 1:13:36.668
You're more interesting
to me now.

1:13:39.706 --> 1:13:40.738

1:34:38.095 --> 1:34:40.029
I've been in a pretty bad
place recently.

1:34:40.064 --> 1:34:41.426
I... I stole some money,

1:34:41.461 --> 1:34:43.461
and I ran away from home
a few months ago.

1:34:43.496 --> 1:34:46.332
And your daughter,
she took these pictures
of me smoking pot,

1:34:46.367 --> 1:34:48.774
and a recording
or something like that,

1:34:48.809 --> 1:34:50.974
and she found my church
in Waterloo somehow,

1:34:51.009 --> 1:34:52.173
and then she sent it to them,

1:34:52.208 --> 1:34:53.911
and they sent it
to my parents...
Wait.

1:34:53.946 --> 1:34:55.143

what they said?

1:34:56.080 --> 1:34:57.112

1:34:58.214 --> 1:35:00.115
And they forgive me.

1:35:00.150 --> 1:35:02.920
And they love me,
and they want me
to come home.

1:35:04.517 --> 1:35:06.055

1:35:07.157 --> 1:35:09.828

Charlie, Alan tried
to escape God's will.

1:36:18.525 --> 1:36:20.899
He chose his life with you
over God.

1:36:20.934 --> 1:36:24.496
But this is why
he was so obsessed
with this verse.

1:36:24.531 --> 1:36:26.300
He knew that he was living
in the flesh,

1:36:26.335 --> 1:36:27.568
and not in the Spirit.

1:36:27.603 --> 1:36:30.942
He never prayed for salvation,
but it's not too late for you.

1:36:30.977 --> 1:36:32.537
Through the Spirit,
you can put to death

1:36:32.572 --> 1:36:34.913
the misdeeds of the body,
and you will live.

1:36:36.510 --> 1:36:39.049
You think Alan died
because he chose
to be with me?

1:36:41.350 --> 1:36:42.987
You think God
turned his back on him

1:36:43.022 --> 1:36:44.186

1:37:21.126 --> 1:37:22.895
Halfway through the semester,

1:37:24.327 --> 1:37:27.966
he started meeting me
during my office hours.

1:37:28.001 --> 1:37:32.168
And we were...
We were crazy
about one another.

1:37:32.203 --> 1:37:34.236

that there isn't a God,

that there's an afterlife,

1:38:19.085 --> 1:38:22.548
