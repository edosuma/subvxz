that when you were scratched,

24:28.710 --> 24:31.279

Precisely.

33:09.029 --> 33:12.866
Our Mr. Bowman had all the fat
he needed to transform,

about half a dozen bags

36:00.634 --> 36:03.369
Very clever.

36:03.421 --> 36:06.256
He's using
the sleeping-Indian defense.

36:06.340 --> 36:10.310
He saw my Rook
about to take his Queen,

36:10.377 --> 36:13.212
and he countered
with his Knight.

36:13.264 --> 36:15.565
So what should do?

36:15.649 --> 36:17.383
- Walter.
- Hmm?

36:17.435 --> 36:20.153
Oh, I'm sorry, my dear.
I'll make less noise. Shh.

36:20.220 --> 36:21.604
No, what you just said.

36:21.689 --> 36:23.389
Porcupines are nocturnal.

36:23.441 --> 36:24.891
They sleep during the day.

36:24.942 --> 36:27.577
- So do vampires.
- Astrid!

36:27.661 --> 36:29.913
Okay, that's why Hicks' windows
were all blacked out.

36:29.997 --> 36:34.167
<i>What is it?</i>
- - Can we get Lincoln on the radio?

36:34.234 --> 36:35.869
Lincoln, do you copy?

36:50.084 --> 36:51.384
Lincoln, do you copy?

36:54.254 --> 36:57.190
[Cell phone rings]

36:57.257 --> 36:58.441

Hello?

<i>Peter, it's me.</i>

37:00.027 --> 37:01.644
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
<i>Turn on the lights.</i>

37:01.729 --> 37:03.363
The creature
is nocturnal.

37:03.430 --> 37:04.864
<i>If it's there,</i>

37:04.932 --> 37:07.200
<i>the lights might</i>
<i>scare it out of hiding.</i>

37:26.554 --> 37:29.422
Aah!

37:34.795 --> 37:36.062
[Gunshot]
Aah!

37:39.800 --> 37:41.968
[Groaning]

37:42.019 --> 37:43.353
Nice shot.

37:44.772 --> 37:46.189
I was aiming for her leg.

37:46.273 --> 37:48.141
[Chuckles]

37:48.192 --> 37:51.611
[Groans]

37:58.318 --> 38:02.005
No!

<i>[Woman sobbing]</i>

38:12.804 --> 38:14.921
[Laughs]

38:17.842 --> 38:20.727
Do you remember this?

38:20.812 --> 38:24.314
I thought it would teach Peter
about magnetism

38:24.381 --> 38:25.816
and centrifugal force.

38:25.883 --> 38:28.384
Oh, Walter, I'm sure
that you and Peter

38:28.436 --> 38:30.220
will have hours of fun
ahead of you.

38:30.271 --> 38:33.106
I know. He's going
to be so excited.

38:33.191 --> 38:34.324
Hey.

38:34.391 --> 38:36.076
Ah!

38:36.160 --> 38:37.327
Ah...

38:37.394 --> 38:40.280
- I love these things.
- So how is she?

38:40.364 --> 38:42.565
Well, Lincoln's still
at the hospital with her,

38:42.617 --> 38:44.167
but the doctors say
she's fine.

38:44.235 --> 38:46.002
The bullet didn't cause
any permanent damage,

38:46.070 --> 38:48.171
and they're treating the virus
with Walter's cure.

38:48.239 --> 38:50.240
But there is
some bad news.

38:50.291 --> 38:52.742
She had absolutely no idea
who created the serum.

38:52.794 --> 38:54.594
It turns out Bowman was the one
who obtained it for them.

38:54.679 --> 38:56.746
So, more questions.

38:56.798 --> 38:59.132
Yeah, about 1,000 more,
starting with,

38:59.217 --> 39:01.134
if David Robert Jones
is behind this,

39:01.219 --> 39:03.186
what's he up to?

39:03.254 --> 39:05.355
You mean assuming
that creating

39:05.422 --> 39:10.193
a flying human-porcupine
hybrid was not his end goal.

39:10.261 --> 39:11.928
Yes, and where is he recruiting
these people from?

39:11.979 --> 39:14.147
And are there more out there?
And who would sign up

39:14.232 --> 39:15.649
<i>to become one</i>
<i>of these things?</i>

39:15.733 --> 39:20.103
"And mankind gains dominion
over all he surveys."

39:20.154 --> 39:22.105
Yeah, what does that mean?

39:22.156 --> 39:23.707
You said that Jones
was a megalomaniac,

39:23.774 --> 39:26.877
that he has
a God complex.

39:26.944 --> 39:28.879
Well, the fact
that we're here at all,

39:28.946 --> 39:32.632
that humanity evolved
from slugs in the ocean--

39:32.717 --> 39:35.168
depending on who
you talk to--

39:35.253 --> 39:40.006
is either a miracle...
or an accident.

39:40.091 --> 39:44.010
Maybe Jones is trying to take
control of the situation.

39:48.182 --> 39:49.966
<i>(Walter)</i>
<i>Agent Broyles...</i>

39:50.017 --> 39:51.634
what a lovely tie.

39:53.771 --> 39:58.474
Agent Dunham...
a word.

40:06.117 --> 40:08.651
Look, I'm--I'm sorry
that I disobeyed your orders.

40:08.703 --> 40:10.871
I shouldn't have got myself
involved in that case.

40:10.955 --> 40:12.989
And if I hadn't, then Lincoln
would never have been injured.

40:13.040 --> 40:14.991
And I get it--
there's a lot

40:15.042 --> 40:16.326
that I need to catch up on.

40:16.377 --> 40:17.844
So, from now on,
no matter what,

40:17.929 --> 40:19.846
I'm going to listen
to what you have to say.

40:19.931 --> 40:23.099
Are you done?

40:23.167 --> 40:24.667
Yes.

40:24.719 --> 40:27.103
I've been on the phone
with the tenth floor

40:27.171 --> 40:29.172
for the past hour.

40:29.223 --> 40:32.675
What we've decided
is this...

40:32.727 --> 40:36.846
If you're 60%
of the Olivia I knew,

40:36.898 --> 40:39.616
you're still better
than 90% of the agents

40:39.683 --> 40:41.785
I've ever worked with.

40:41.852 --> 40:44.237
And a Fringe Division
with an Olivia Dunham is better

40:44.322 --> 40:48.291
than a Fringe Division
without her.

40:48.359 --> 40:50.877
- Thank you.
- Good work today...

40:50.962 --> 40:53.863
Agent.

41:15.987 --> 41:19.940
What is it?

41:20.024 --> 41:22.275
You're having
second thoughts.

41:22.360 --> 41:26.446
Of course I am.
It killed your brother.

41:26.530 --> 41:29.082
We have been over this.

41:29.166 --> 41:31.418
Something
must have gone wrong.

41:31.502 --> 41:33.954
- Mel...
- We can be born anew.

41:34.038 --> 41:37.140
The two of us...

41:37.208 --> 41:39.676
together.

41:39.743 --> 41:43.079
We can be children
of the new world.
