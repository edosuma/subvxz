WEBVTT

00:02.739 --> 00:04.677
This week was all about
style. We're here today. It's
not to grocery shop.

00:04.677 --> 00:06.580
I am so excited to shoot
avant garde.

00:06.580 --> 00:08.250
Ow. That was my scalp.

00:08.250 --> 00:10.253
You complain
like no one's business.

00:10.253 --> 00:14.294
You have to stop it.

00:14.294 --> 00:15.598
If you tell me something,
you have to prove it to me.

00:15.598 --> 00:18.771
Because now
you lied to me.

00:18.771 --> 00:22.144
The next name
I'm gonna call is--

00:22.144 --> 00:23.548
I think we're making
a mistake for a second.

00:23.548 --> 00:25.317
Congratulations, Kyle.

00:28.290 --> 00:29.693
It was very difficult
to make this decision.

01:15.852 --> 01:20.160
<i>♪ Crank,
crank that ♪</i>

01:20.160 --> 01:21.228
- Hey, y'all.
- Oh, hello, Kyle.

01:24.736 --> 01:27.407
- Hello.
- How are you?

01:27.407 --> 01:28.109
- No, you're not.
- No, you're not.

01:31.115 --> 01:33.587
Last week,
I was in the bottom two.

01:33.587 --> 01:35.759
I do find a lot of this process
<i>to be emotionally taxing.</i>

01:35.759 --> 01:40.467
Ew, this is dirty.

01:40.467 --> 01:41.604
It would be nice
having someone in this house

01:41.604 --> 01:45.177
who is comforting me.

01:45.177 --> 01:48.116
<i>Marissa is really hot
and really distracting.</i>

01:48.116 --> 01:50.287
I see something in Marissa
that I don't see in myself,

01:50.287 --> 01:54.228
<i>and that's usually
what I'm attracted to.</i>

01:54.228 --> 01:56.432
<i>I definitely do want to try
to get to know her</i>

01:56.432 --> 01:56.967
a little bit better
and get closer to her.

01:59.472 --> 02:00.140
Yeah?

02:04.081 --> 02:04.148
I don't want to say
it's not fair,

02:08.824 --> 02:10.729
because they're judges,
they're allowed to do
whatever they want,

02:10.729 --> 02:12.331
but I felt the most bad
for you guys in that moment

02:12.331 --> 02:14.135
when we were just
standing there like--

02:14.135 --> 02:15.303
- That was weird!
- It's just, like,

02:15.303 --> 02:16.774
it's awkward
for the rest of us.

02:16.774 --> 02:18.476
I honestly don't get it.

02:18.476 --> 02:21.449
Last panel was really,
really, really hard.

02:21.449 --> 02:24.255
The judges didn't see
the editorial girl
they're looking for.

02:24.255 --> 02:26.994
<i>But I'm using that fuel,
that drive,</i>

02:26.994 --> 02:29.065
<i>to push me even harder</i>

02:29.065 --> 02:30.434
and excel in this competition
and prove him wrong.

02:30.434 --> 02:33.674
I try so hard,
and tonight
she made it a point,

02:33.674 --> 02:36.780
"No, you really need
to impress me,"

02:36.780 --> 02:37.749
like, "This is your
last chance" type thing.

02:39.819 --> 02:40.086
( whimpers )
Please!

02:47.268 --> 02:52.344
Yes, I'm riddled
with anxiety.

02:52.344 --> 02:54.182
Marissa:
With Kyle and I,
I like hanging out with her.

02:54.182 --> 02:56.854
She's definitely
a very sweet, sweet girl,

02:56.854 --> 02:58.323
<i>and I just like
that she's mature</i>

02:58.323 --> 03:01.196
<i>and she's not filled
with drama.</i>

03:01.196 --> 03:02.865
<i>And I don't believe
that love has a gender.</i>

03:02.865 --> 03:04.536
I would fall in love
with a girl.

03:04.536 --> 03:06.139
I would fall in love
with a guy. Anything.

03:06.139 --> 03:07.876
So what are you
thinking about?

03:07.876 --> 03:10.214
Can I just explain to you,

03:10.214 --> 03:11.817
when I like somebody,
it makes me really shy.

03:11.817 --> 03:13.019
I've very attracted to,
like, your presence.

03:13.019 --> 03:15.658
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

03:15.658 --> 03:17.963
I never got the vibe.

03:17.963 --> 03:19.633
I just did not think
your personality would
mix well with mine.

03:19.633 --> 03:22.371
- But opposites
like, attract.
- Mm-hmm.

03:22.371 --> 03:24.710
So, like,
I like what I like.

03:24.710 --> 03:25.878
We should go to bed, though.

03:39.471 --> 03:44.348
Ashley: Ladies!

03:44.348 --> 03:46.052
India:
I was upstairs
just doing my thing.

03:46.052 --> 03:47.522
I hear Ashley Graham
in our living room.

03:47.522 --> 03:50.761
- No way! Ashley?
- Hi!

03:50.761 --> 03:54.870
- We're gonna cook dinner!
- Whoo!

03:54.870 --> 03:57.307
We get to cook dinner

03:57.307 --> 03:58.578
and spend the rest
of the evening with Ashley.

03:58.578 --> 03:59.913
- How are you? Good.
- Good.

03:59.913 --> 04:02.084
I wanted to come
and hang out with you guys

04:02.084 --> 04:04.657
because first of all,
I just wanted to

04:04.657 --> 04:06.593
get to know you guys
a little bit better
on a personal level

04:06.593 --> 04:08.864
because I hate
just meeting you guys
at eliminations.

04:08.864 --> 04:13.406
So this week's theme
is all about body
and strength.

04:13.406 --> 04:15.845
I'll be your mentor
this entire week,

04:15.845 --> 04:18.450
starting with
tomorrow's challenge.

04:18.450 --> 04:19.953
- Yay!
- I have been in your shoes.

04:19.953 --> 04:23.561
I have been
the girl who's like,

04:23.561 --> 04:25.364
"I don't feel good enough.

04:25.364 --> 04:26.567
I'm fighting against
these other models.

04:26.567 --> 04:29.004
How do I get to the top?"

04:29.004 --> 04:31.076
And as a model,
eating right
is very important.

04:31.076 --> 04:33.881
Right? Not, not eating.
You have to eat healthy.

04:33.881 --> 04:36.218
So we're gonna make
my signature favorite
dish tonight,

04:36.218 --> 04:39.291
and it's called
kale pesto pasta.

04:39.291 --> 04:41.062
- Ooh!
- Let's get started.

04:41.062 --> 04:43.100
- Yay!
- All right.

04:43.100 --> 04:44.869
Woo!

04:44.869 --> 04:47.274
Ashley:
Maybe two bunches of kale.

04:47.274 --> 04:50.715
There's never
enough cheese.

04:50.715 --> 04:52.050
How are you feeling?

04:55.156 --> 04:55.724
You know,
I did want to ask you,

04:58.329 --> 05:01.135
'cause the more
I hear about you,

05:01.135 --> 05:04.442
the more similarities--

05:04.442 --> 05:06.212
I identify with a lot
of things you've said.

05:06.212 --> 05:08.617
Ashley has been
so supportive to me

05:08.617 --> 05:11.489
throughout this competition,

05:11.489 --> 05:13.493
<i>and I relate to her
on so many levels.</i>

05:13.493 --> 05:15.397
<i>The judges are
always telling me that
I'm too sexy</i>

05:15.397 --> 05:18.403
and that is something

05:18.403 --> 05:20.508
that I've been struggling
with all of my life.

05:20.508 --> 05:22.845
For example,
like, growing up
in my childhood,

05:22.845 --> 05:25.951
I was, like,
sexually harassed--

05:25.951 --> 05:27.354
- Oh, my God.
- So many things that, like,

05:27.354 --> 05:29.191
I know, like, you also
go through that, too.

05:29.191 --> 05:31.764
Yeah, I have been
through that. Yeah.

05:31.764 --> 05:33.700
It's always been
a struggle for me.

05:33.700 --> 05:35.672
- Just like...
- For me, like,

05:35.672 --> 05:37.742
I'm using my body
to break a barrier.

05:37.742 --> 05:40.515
And the bigger message for me

05:40.515 --> 05:41.950
is to let women
who look like me

05:41.950 --> 05:44.188
know that they are
beautiful and that they--

05:44.188 --> 05:48.029
they don't have
to be over-sexualized
to be beautiful.

05:48.029 --> 05:50.502
You know what?
Tell your story.
That's your message.

05:50.502 --> 05:53.340
That's what the girls--
it's like, oh, my gosh.

05:53.340 --> 05:55.110
I shouldn't be ashamed,
I shouldn't be embarrassed.

05:55.110 --> 05:58.049
No, the only thing
we should be ashamed of

05:58.049 --> 06:00.220
is that hoodie--
that full-length onesie.

06:00.220 --> 06:02.625
She takes pride in that.
She takes pride in that.

06:02.625 --> 06:03.961
You don't understand.

06:03.961 --> 06:05.732
For her to connect with me

06:05.732 --> 06:07.301
and open up to me
one on one

06:07.301 --> 06:09.005
<i>was very inspiring,
very touching.</i>

06:09.005 --> 06:10.373
<i>I know what I want
for myself</i>

06:10.373 --> 06:12.311
and I have big dreams
and ambitions

06:12.311 --> 06:14.282
and I'm not gonna stop
until I accomplish them.

06:14.282 --> 06:16.219
- Should we say grace?
- Oh, wait. Go for it.

06:16.219 --> 06:17.889
- Who says it?
- Not me.

06:17.889 --> 06:19.392
I'll say it. Dear Lord,

06:19.392 --> 06:20.895
or the universe,
or whatever you believe in,

06:20.895 --> 06:22.865
thank you for giving us
this opportunity

06:22.865 --> 06:24.736
to become friends,
to become sisters,

06:24.736 --> 06:26.540
to become America's
next Top Model.

06:26.540 --> 06:28.844
And thank you so much
for being present
in this moment

06:28.844 --> 06:31.917
and allowing us to be
supportive of one another

06:31.917 --> 06:33.587
but also competing with
the utmost of fierceness.

06:33.587 --> 06:36.927
- Amen.
- And bless this food.

06:36.927 --> 06:38.731
- Amen!
- ( laughing )

06:38.731 --> 06:40.199
So what are
the biggest challenges?

06:43.239 --> 06:45.845
For me, I know
100% in my heart,
I am a boss.

06:45.845 --> 06:48.750
So how do I make
you guys see that?

06:48.750 --> 06:51.155
I think that
as we continue to go

06:51.155 --> 06:53.026
through eliminations
and challenges,

06:53.026 --> 06:56.432
we'll really see
the true you

06:56.432 --> 06:58.604
and who's able
to create something
beyond just their image.

06:58.604 --> 07:02.912
Y'all definitely have
given us some heart attacks
in this house, for sure.

07:02.912 --> 07:06.118
I bet. I bet.
Last elimination was rough.

07:06.118 --> 07:09.526
- Oh, yeah.
- Kyle: Law said it was down
to the way that I stood,

07:09.526 --> 07:12.431
and I'm really disappointed
that he got that
impression from me.

07:12.431 --> 07:15.237
You know what would be
really interesting, Kyle?

07:15.237 --> 07:18.276
How did you know
I was gonna say that?

07:18.276 --> 07:20.180
Why not, Kyle?
Go for it.

07:20.180 --> 07:21.950
I'm actually gonna be
really disappointed

07:21.950 --> 07:23.921
if you're not
wearing high heels.

07:23.921 --> 07:25.089
Well, then I have
to wear heels.

07:25.089 --> 07:26.627
If you aren't,
I'm gonna call you out.

07:26.627 --> 07:28.730
Today was so much fun

07:31.268 --> 07:32.972
<i>with Ashley coming over
and making dinner.</i>

07:32.972 --> 07:35.110
Give me a quick tour.
I want to see the rest
of the house.

07:35.110 --> 07:37.548
It seems like Ashley
wanted to give me another
chance.

07:37.548 --> 07:39.920
I'm gonna keep trying
to change those judges'
minds about me,

07:39.920 --> 07:42.992
and definitely gonna
fight for it.

07:42.992 --> 07:45.096
Ashley:
I'm so glad
I got to interact

07:45.096 --> 07:46.165
and meet all of you guys
on a deeper level.

07:46.165 --> 07:49.304
- Seriously.
- Thank you.

07:49.304 --> 07:51.977
- Seriously.
- Girl, I got a man
at home waiting on me.

07:51.977 --> 07:54.081
Okay, I'm the one
that can leave, all right?

07:54.081 --> 07:56.485
- Bye, guys! Love you.
- Bye!

07:56.485 --> 07:58.155
See you tomorrow.

08:01.764 --> 08:06.338
I think Ashley
is super bomb.

08:06.338 --> 08:07.609
<i>It was just
a really good night.</i>

08:07.609 --> 08:08.342
We all got to vibe out.

08:12.184 --> 08:17.361
Binta:
After Ashley left,
I was embarrassed.

08:17.361 --> 08:20.033
You can't even
walk in this house
with your bare feet

08:20.033 --> 08:22.639
because it's just nasty.

08:22.639 --> 08:23.841
Can we just do it now?
Like, a 15-minute
clean session

08:23.841 --> 08:25.443
- with everyone doing--
- I'll start.

08:40.373 --> 08:45.116
<i>They didn't take their time
doing anything.</i>

08:45.116 --> 08:46.318
I'm telling you,
they did not clean anything.

08:46.318 --> 08:48.890
Nothing.

08:48.890 --> 08:49.157
What do you want us
to be doing?

08:52.364 --> 08:56.806
- Our bedroom--
- The restrooms are not clean.

08:56.806 --> 08:58.275
Y'all didn't do ( bleep ).

09:00.681 --> 09:03.118
<i>Tatiana just annoyed
the ( bleep ) out of me.</i>

09:03.118 --> 09:05.357
I cleaned the bathroom
last time,

09:05.357 --> 09:06.225
and she has stupid hairs
that are all over the floor.

09:06.225 --> 09:09.131
Not mine.

09:09.131 --> 09:11.068
- I spray it every day.
- This looks cleans to you?

09:11.068 --> 09:14.542
No, I'm saying
I spray it down every day.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.378
Tatiana:
I feel like she was trying
to antagonize me.

09:16.378 --> 09:18.918
I don't do well with
personalities like that,

09:18.918 --> 09:20.588
because I will go
from zero to 100

09:20.588 --> 09:21.756
really, really quick.

09:24.595 --> 09:28.837
But, Binta, everyone is in
and out of the bathroom.

09:28.837 --> 09:30.875
You're the only one
who has water everywhere.

09:30.875 --> 09:33.747
You're right. Bye.
Okay, bye, bye, bye.

09:33.747 --> 09:35.350
Binta:
What I'm telling you that--

09:35.350 --> 09:37.154
Just stop talking!
I don't wanna talk about it.

09:37.154 --> 09:38.322
- Shut up!
Shut the ( bleep ) up!
- I'm telling you--

09:38.322 --> 09:39.993
You can yell.
I can yell louder.

09:39.993 --> 09:42.598
That's it, period.

09:42.598 --> 09:45.705
I'm not gonna go at it
with you over something
that you've done.

09:45.705 --> 09:48.710
- What have I done?
- You don't want me
to get mad you at you.

09:48.710 --> 09:49.845
Who has been cleaning
this bathroom?

09:49.845 --> 09:51.082
Who has been cleaning
this bathroom?

09:51.082 --> 09:53.219
Yes! Literally every day!

09:53.219 --> 09:56.960
I'm wiping it up!
Okay, bye, shut up!

09:56.960 --> 09:59.131
Bye, my ass, bitch!
You ain't gonna do ( bleep ),
so shut the ( bleep ) up.

09:59.131 --> 10:02.203
All I'm telling you is
do not tell me you do

10:02.203 --> 10:05.443
when you know you ain't
doing nothing, okay?

10:05.443 --> 10:06.580
I can't control my hands.
I will ( bleep ) hit a bitch.

10:06.580 --> 10:09.753
I'm not being difficult.

10:09.753 --> 10:10.922
Marissa has a little bit
of a temper.

10:10.922 --> 10:12.057
You're out of your
( bleep ) mind.

10:12.057 --> 10:12.958
( imitating
suspenseful music )

10:14.930 --> 10:16.900
You just don't give me
the best photos.

10:16.900 --> 10:17.968
- I tried to keep my
face-- - You don't even try with
your face.

10:27.420 --> 10:32.732
Binta:
You're the one that's making
this bathroom dirty more!

10:32.732 --> 10:34.468
- Tatiana:
Okay, bye, shut up!
- Bye, my ass, bitch!

10:34.468 --> 10:36.472
You ain't gonna do ( bleep
), so shut the ( bleep ) up.

10:36.472 --> 10:37.641
- You right.
I can't do ( bleep ).
- Yeah!

10:37.641 --> 10:39.546
If I could, then I would.

10:39.546 --> 10:41.215
Literally every time I
come in the bathroom after you,

10:41.215 --> 10:42.652
the whole ( bleep ) is
wet. It's soaking wet.

10:42.652 --> 10:44.487
- That's a lie!
- That's annoying.

10:44.487 --> 10:46.325
That's a lie. That's a lie.
You cannot say that.

10:46.325 --> 10:48.096
- You cannot say that.
- Have a good night.

10:48.096 --> 10:50.668
Bitch, you know
you ain't gonna do ( bleep ).

10:50.668 --> 10:52.905
Tatiana:
<i>We're not even arguing</i>

10:52.905 --> 10:53.841
because you have
nothing to say but,

10:53.841 --> 10:55.477
"Bitch, bitch, bitch,

10:55.477 --> 10:56.813
( bleep ) you,
bitch, bitch, bitch."

10:56.813 --> 10:57.982
Binta:
All I'm telling you is

10:57.982 --> 10:59.819
do not tell me
you do ( bleep )

10:59.819 --> 11:01.522
when you know you ain't
doing nothing, okay?

11:01.522 --> 11:03.359
Everything that comes out
of her mouth is just nasty.

11:03.359 --> 11:04.863
Please, don't tell me,
"Oh I have swept,
I have cleaned."

11:04.863 --> 11:07.602
Tatiana: All right,
so I'm not listening.

11:07.602 --> 11:08.971
You need to shut up now.
I'm done.

11:08.971 --> 11:10.340
I will do whatever
the ( bleep ) I want to do

11:10.340 --> 11:12.144
and you're not gonna--
nothing is gonna happen.

11:12.144 --> 11:14.247
That's what I'm telling you.

11:14.247 --> 11:15.952
CoryAnne:
<i>Binta is arrogant,</i>

11:15.952 --> 11:16.986
and does not know how
to control her emotions.

11:16.986 --> 11:18.657
Lies! Lying!
Stupid ass bitch!

11:18.657 --> 11:21.329
I don't like
people like you.

11:21.329 --> 11:23.198
It's gonna definitely
be her downfall.

11:23.198 --> 11:25.537
I'm not talking--
there's not gonna be
no conversation.

11:25.537 --> 11:27.708
Sit there and talk
about what the ( bleep ) else
you want to talk about

11:27.708 --> 11:29.979
but my name on
there, okay?

11:34.722 --> 11:39.064
Marissa:
Do you want to hang out, Kyle,

11:39.064 --> 11:40.333
or do you want to
go to sleep?

11:40.333 --> 11:41.536
I want to hang out
for a little bit.

11:41.536 --> 11:42.705
We can hang
out downstairs.

11:42.705 --> 11:45.010
- Is that where you want
to? - Mm-hmm.

11:45.010 --> 11:47.180
Kyle:
<i>There's a lot of drama
in the house right now.</i>

11:47.180 --> 11:48.717
I just want to go and get
away from all of them.

11:48.717 --> 11:52.357
I'm down to do whatever.

11:52.357 --> 11:54.696
<i>I didn't expect
to necessarily hit it off</i>

11:54.696 --> 11:56.031
with anybody
in this house.

11:58.302 --> 12:02.143
Marissa is only 18,
almost 19 years old,

12:02.143 --> 12:06.753
<i>but very confident
in the fact</i>

12:06.753 --> 12:09.324
<i>that she has a similar
alternative sexuality</i>

12:09.324 --> 12:11.829
and she has
really no hesitation
with any of that.

12:52.444 --> 12:56.118
( Marissa giggles )

13:04.635 --> 13:08.643
Oh, my God.

13:08.643 --> 13:11.481
Oh, my God.

13:11.481 --> 13:14.254
- Hi, ladies!
- Hi!

13:14.254 --> 13:18.162
Welcome to one
of the best views
in all five boroughs.

13:18.162 --> 13:21.402
This gorgeous skyline
is the backdrop to your
next challenge.

13:21.402 --> 13:25.978
You'll be doing
what I like to call
extreme posing.

13:25.978 --> 13:29.284
Each of you will
be leaping in the air
on this trampoline.

13:29.284 --> 13:32.423
Cody:
<i>I'm obsessed with seeing
the trampoline,</i>

13:32.423 --> 13:34.562
because I don't remember
the last time

13:34.562 --> 13:35.831
I've been on a trampoline.

13:35.831 --> 13:37.167
As a model,
action shots like these

13:37.167 --> 13:38.636
show why it's critical
for your bodies

13:38.636 --> 13:41.008
to always be
in tip-top shape.

13:41.008 --> 13:42.678
And in this challenge,
you must bring
your photo to life

13:42.678 --> 13:46.251
while looking
gorgeous in motion.

13:46.251 --> 13:47.989
<i>Now that sportswear is so
intertwined with fashion,</i>

13:47.989 --> 13:50.527
<i>and stars like Kanye,
Rihanna, and Rita</i>

13:50.527 --> 13:53.934
<i>all collaborate
with major sports brands,</i>

13:53.934 --> 13:55.505
<i>you have to know how
to model in the genre.</i>

13:55.505 --> 13:57.942
But here's the twist,

13:57.942 --> 14:00.079
you only get one chance
to get it right.

14:00.079 --> 14:02.117
- Oh!
- Oh, my God.

14:02.117 --> 14:03.252
And the model
with the best image

14:03.252 --> 14:05.758
is gonna receive
a special treat.

14:05.758 --> 14:07.928
- ( cheering )
- Good luck, girls!

14:07.928 --> 14:10.299
India: <i>We get one
shot to nail this.</i>

14:10.299 --> 14:12.437
We have to jump
on this trampoline,

14:12.437 --> 14:13.840
and at the top of our jump
do a pose

14:13.840 --> 14:15.778
and get a good shot
in one take.

14:15.778 --> 14:17.882
Ashley:
The first girl is up!

14:17.882 --> 14:20.119
Krislian!
Come on, pigtails.

14:20.119 --> 14:21.723
Massimo Campana:
Start bouncing.
Get some elevation.

14:21.723 --> 14:24.160
- Oh!
- Ooh!

14:24.160 --> 14:25.898
Krislian:
I have a lot to prove
to the judges,

14:25.898 --> 14:28.469
so coming in today's
challenge, I feel the pressure.

14:28.469 --> 14:30.306
<i>And the last time
I was on a trampoline,</i>

14:30.306 --> 14:32.545
I fell and I almost
broke my neck.

14:32.545 --> 14:35.049
So getting that single take
for this shot is very scary.

14:35.049 --> 14:38.657
Now we're gonna
do it for real.

14:38.657 --> 14:40.292
All right,
one, two, three.

14:40.292 --> 14:42.565
Ashley:
<i>Krislian was trying
to be too sexy.</i>

14:42.565 --> 14:45.336
<i>She was thinking
high-end editorial</i>

14:45.336 --> 14:47.140
<i>and not active
sports campaign.</i>

14:47.140 --> 14:48.342
<i>Even while you're
jumping on a trampoline,</i>

14:48.342 --> 14:50.981
you still have to model--

14:50.981 --> 14:51.750
<i>face, body, and attitude.</i>

14:51.750 --> 14:54.320
Binta!

15:00.433 --> 15:05.343
- Ashley: Look at her.
- Massimo: Whoa!

15:05.343 --> 15:07.715
Binta definitely looked
like she never jumped

15:07.715 --> 15:10.588
on a trampoline before.

15:10.588 --> 15:11.556
<i>Maybe they didn't have
trampolines in Gambia.</i>

15:11.556 --> 15:13.593
One, two, three.

15:13.593 --> 15:15.496
Ashley: <i>Binta looked
like there was something</i>

15:15.496 --> 15:17.033
<i>too strong about her face</i>

15:17.033 --> 15:18.336
and her mouth wasn't relaxed.

15:18.336 --> 15:20.406
Next up is Miss Tatiana!

15:20.406 --> 15:22.678
Tatiana:
I need to show more
of my boss qualities.

15:22.678 --> 15:25.450
I do have all
the qualities.

15:25.450 --> 15:26.886
I just need to make sure
everyone knows it.

15:26.886 --> 15:28.924
Massimo: All right,
one, two, three.

15:28.924 --> 15:30.795
Ashley: Tatiana,
her face was strong,

15:30.795 --> 15:33.132
but I wish I could've
seen her go into a motion

15:33.132 --> 15:34.569
<i>instead of just
giving me a pose.</i>

15:34.569 --> 15:37.107
Cody!

15:37.107 --> 15:40.080
All right, next up
is my girl India!

15:40.080 --> 15:42.851
Paige! Strong face.
No "rah-rah" cheerleaders.

15:42.851 --> 15:47.093
One, two, three.

15:47.093 --> 15:48.797
Ashley:
Paige knew exactly
what she wanted to do.

15:48.797 --> 15:50.033
Like, it was a huge billboard
in Times Square, just power.

15:50.033 --> 15:53.406
Courtney, you're next!

15:53.406 --> 15:57.246
CoryAnne.

15:57.246 --> 15:59.752
Marissa:
<i>Last night, I just sort
of kissed Kyle.</i>

15:59.752 --> 16:02.257
Am I her girlfriend?
Absolutely not.

16:02.257 --> 16:04.729
Marissa!

16:04.729 --> 16:06.231
<i>But is there some sort of
chemistry there? Of course.</i>

16:06.231 --> 16:07.835
<i>But I need to stop
thinking about it</i>

16:07.835 --> 16:09.204
<i>and just focus
on the competition.</i>

16:09.204 --> 16:11.475
One, two, three.

16:11.475 --> 16:15.483
Ashley:
Next up is Kyle.

16:15.483 --> 16:17.120
Massimo:
One, two, three.

16:17.120 --> 16:19.090
Ashley: <i>Kyle
obviously had no plan</i>

16:19.090 --> 16:21.094
<i>going into
this challenge.</i>

16:21.094 --> 16:22.230
<i>As a model, it's really
important to understand</i>

16:22.230 --> 16:23.733
how to control your face
and your body,

16:23.733 --> 16:25.805
but all at the same time.

16:25.805 --> 16:26.338
Thank you ladies so much.

16:28.676 --> 16:30.346
Massimo and I are gonna go
look at all the footage now

16:30.346 --> 16:33.018
and come back and tell you
who won the challenge.

16:33.018 --> 16:35.824
The thing about this
challenge that was really
important

16:35.824 --> 16:37.360
<i>is that we saw
a lot of definition
in the girls' bodies.</i>

16:37.360 --> 16:40.200
<i>Because when
you're jumping,</i>

16:40.200 --> 16:41.536
<i>all of your muscle
definition comes out.</i>

16:41.536 --> 16:44.141
So this is where you
really get to showcase

16:44.141 --> 16:45.678
all of your hard work
as a model.

16:45.678 --> 16:47.013
Massimo: Krislian
tried with the body,

16:47.013 --> 16:48.983
but it didn't translate
in the face at all.

16:48.983 --> 16:51.021
Binta was trying to think
outside the box.

16:51.021 --> 16:53.627
- She was trying
to be too edgy.
- Too edgy.

16:53.627 --> 16:55.664
I am so impressed
with Paige.

16:55.664 --> 16:58.202
For me this is
a Nike campaign,
and she got it done.

16:58.202 --> 17:00.607
Marissa actually
looks athletic,
her body looks great.

17:00.607 --> 17:04.147
- She's getting prettier
and prettier to me.
- Yeah.

17:04.147 --> 17:06.118
All right, ladies,
we've reviewed
all your photographs,

17:06.118 --> 17:09.391
and as you know,
this challenge was about
bodies in motion.

17:09.391 --> 17:11.729
So the winner
of this challenge is...

17:13.466 --> 17:15.102
- Paige.
- Woo!

17:17.975 --> 17:21.047
Paige:
<i>I'm so excited right now.</i>

17:21.047 --> 17:23.352
I just won my very
first challenge.

17:23.352 --> 17:25.356
You have won a 90-minute
deep tissue massage
at your house.

17:25.356 --> 17:29.230
And you are gonna be able
to choose another girl
to get it done with you.

17:29.230 --> 17:32.905
- Oh, no! Oh, no!
- Thank you so much.

17:32.905 --> 17:33.305
You guys did a great job
and I'll see you guys later.

17:43.760 --> 17:48.001
- Hi, guys.
- Hello.

17:48.001 --> 17:50.808
So I win a massage

17:50.808 --> 17:52.979
<i>and I get to split it
with Tatiana.</i>

17:52.979 --> 17:55.350
Tatiana is feeling stressed
from all the screaming,

17:55.350 --> 17:59.024
fighting,
arguing with Binta.

17:59.024 --> 18:00.861
And it felt like
the right thing to do

18:00.861 --> 18:02.196
to give that massage to her.

18:04.836 --> 18:09.277
Marissa and Kyle came
literally out of nowhere,

18:09.277 --> 18:11.950
and now they're a thing.

18:11.950 --> 18:12.383
Now they're just booed up
all the time.

18:15.524 --> 18:20.299
Paige:
<i>Kyle is quiet</i>

18:20.299 --> 18:22.203
and Marissa is the wild child,
loud one of the house,

18:22.203 --> 18:23.940
and I think that these
two opposites attract.

18:29.283 --> 18:34.127
...if she goes home,
that's one less person
for me to win.

18:34.127 --> 18:35.797
Marissa, she's my bedmate,
so I told her,

18:37.968 --> 18:40.239
"Girl, I love you and all,

18:40.239 --> 18:41.743
<i>but focus on
the competition.</i>

18:41.743 --> 18:42.309
Oh!
Best challenge
prize ever.

18:43.379 --> 18:48.155
( ringing )

18:48.155 --> 18:49.224
That is sad, Kyle.
More grace, grace, grace!

18:49.224 --> 18:52.063
Ashley:
This is so terrible.

18:52.063 --> 18:53.566
Rita:
It's more about
your presence

18:53.566 --> 18:55.002
and your body
and your angles.

18:55.002 --> 18:55.637
I still feel like
you're not elevating.

19:06.759 --> 19:11.435
There's always room
for improvement.

19:11.435 --> 19:13.172
I definitely want to
be more toned.

19:13.172 --> 19:15.310
I feel like my body
would be so happy
if I had a six pack.

19:15.310 --> 19:17.681
It would really love me,
because it wants to be
a six pack,

19:17.681 --> 19:19.986
- but I'm just not--
it wants to so bad!
- It wants to. It's begging.

19:19.986 --> 19:22.591
- RitAlert!
- Come on, my babies!

19:24.629 --> 19:28.636
- This is it.
- Hi, ladies.

19:28.636 --> 19:32.243
I've been known to knock
out my competition in business.

19:32.243 --> 19:34.481
Given that this week's theme is
all about body and strength,

19:34.481 --> 19:38.589
now it's your turn.
Good luck.

19:38.589 --> 19:40.794
Wait, what'd she say?
I didn't even understand.

19:40.794 --> 19:42.964
Something about
knocking out
the competition.

19:42.964 --> 19:44.468
Something about knocking
out the competition, basically.

19:44.468 --> 19:46.939
- We're boxing.
- We're boxing?

19:46.939 --> 19:49.144
I'm definitely very
active. This is gonna be my
shoot.

19:49.144 --> 19:52.383
- Yes!
- I know how to box!
I'm so excited!

19:52.383 --> 19:53.986
Ten seconds in
the ring with me,
y'all are done.

20:00.634 --> 20:05.611
India:
So we walked into
Gleason's Gym

20:05.611 --> 20:07.147
<i>and there's speed bags
and punching bags</i>

20:07.147 --> 20:10.653
<i>and boxing rings,</i>

20:10.653 --> 20:12.056
so of course
we're boxing today.

20:12.056 --> 20:14.327
Welcome to
Gleason's Boxing Gym.

20:14.327 --> 20:17.467
As a model, your body
is your business.

20:17.467 --> 20:19.538
So you need to
learn to love it,
treat it right,

20:19.538 --> 20:23.011
and constantly
work to improve it.

20:23.011 --> 20:24.815
Also in the high end
editorial world right now,
boxing is so trendy.

20:24.815 --> 20:28.590
So today you're gonna put
your bodies in motion,

20:28.590 --> 20:31.194
and you job is
to remain beautiful

20:31.194 --> 20:32.998
in this high impact editorial.

20:32.998 --> 20:35.069
Working in motion,

20:35.069 --> 20:36.171
specifically when
it's a still image,

20:36.171 --> 20:38.142
is really, really hard.

20:38.142 --> 20:40.514
<i>When it's done right,
it's amazing.</i>

20:40.514 --> 20:41.414
When it's done wrong,
it's horrible.

20:43.018 --> 20:43.686
I'm excited.

20:48.028 --> 20:50.166
Kyle:
<i>Last week I was in
the bottom two.</i>

20:50.166 --> 20:52.170
<i>I know I can do
a lot better than that.</i>

20:52.170 --> 20:53.873
But at the same time,

20:53.873 --> 20:55.209
the situation between
Marissa and I

20:55.209 --> 20:56.211
<i>is super distracting.</i>

20:56.211 --> 20:57.246
<i>So it's hard.</i>

20:59.384 --> 21:02.724
Even though I have failed
in so many ways,

21:02.724 --> 21:05.096
I still feel like I've had
those superstar moments.

21:05.096 --> 21:06.932
Totally. No, I agree.

21:09.538 --> 21:10.874
<i>And I have control
over my emotions,</i>

21:10.874 --> 21:13.078
<i>but with Marissa
it's hard.</i>

21:13.078 --> 21:15.718
Oh, my God. It's so much.

21:15.718 --> 21:16.886
- Ladies. <i>Hola!</i>
- Hi!

21:19.758 --> 21:24.101
So I wanted to introduce you
to a dear, dear friend of mine.

21:24.101 --> 21:28.610
She is a super model.

21:28.610 --> 21:31.783
She uses boxing to keep
her body in check.

21:31.783 --> 21:36.158
She's also a fellow
"Sports Illustrated" model!

21:36.158 --> 21:40.065
Girl, get your booty
on out here!

21:40.065 --> 21:43.472
( cheering )

21:43.472 --> 21:45.409
- Hi, ladies.
- Chanel Iman, ladies.

21:48.315 --> 21:52.791
Chanel Iman is
this beautiful model.

21:52.791 --> 21:55.664
<i>She's been in
a Victoria's Secret
fashion show,</i>

21:55.664 --> 21:58.402
<i>been in "Vogue"
and a bunch of high fashion
editorial magazines.</i>

21:58.402 --> 22:01.274
<i>She's been able to do
the transition from being
sexy to editorial,</i>

22:01.274 --> 22:04.582
which is what I want
for myself.

22:04.582 --> 22:06.084
It's so good
to meet you all.

22:06.084 --> 22:08.022
- Hey!
- Hi.

22:08.022 --> 22:09.792
And I'm so excited,

22:09.792 --> 22:10.760
because I will be
shooting with you today.

22:10.760 --> 22:13.465
- ( cheering )
- Yes!

22:13.465 --> 22:15.136
- So you want to know
what that means?
- Yeah.

22:15.136 --> 22:17.239
You all have
to out-super model
the super model.

22:17.239 --> 22:20.613
- Oh!
- So good luck.

22:20.613 --> 22:22.416
Oh, wow.

22:26.291 --> 22:29.965
Very nice to meet you.

22:30.968 --> 22:31.635
Very good.

22:35.643 --> 22:37.514
In these shots, what
I'm looking for from them

22:37.514 --> 22:39.718
<i>is to actually be
a balance with Chanel,</i>

22:39.718 --> 22:41.522
and to show that they can
be in action with someone else

22:41.522 --> 22:45.496
and have some type
of connection together.

22:45.496 --> 22:47.667
Try to stretch your legs
a little bit.

22:47.667 --> 22:49.505
- Stretch 'em?
- Yeah, make 'em longer.

22:49.505 --> 22:51.441
Chanel: She was very
comfortable on set

22:51.441 --> 22:55.049
and she just went
for the shot.

22:55.049 --> 22:59.157
That's great.

22:59.157 --> 23:02.163
Tatiana...

23:02.163 --> 23:05.335
<i>It's irritating
just watching it,
to be honest.</i>

23:05.335 --> 23:08.308
But she's not
better than me. Hell, no.

23:08.308 --> 23:10.345
CoryAnne:
At last week's panel,
I got best photo,

23:10.345 --> 23:13.920
so I've got to stay
at the top.

23:13.920 --> 23:16.358
Yeah. Great, done.

23:16.358 --> 23:19.364
Chanel:
Maybe it's easier
if we go like this?

23:19.364 --> 23:21.703
Put your foot out
and then, one.

23:21.703 --> 23:24.207
That's good.
Now I'm believing it more.

23:24.207 --> 23:25.877
Ashley:
These are good,
I think we got it.

23:25.877 --> 23:26.712
We need movement.
That's good.

23:29.317 --> 23:31.522
Open your arm.
Open your arm.

23:31.522 --> 23:32.256
- Chin up a little bit.
- Much better.

23:34.862 --> 23:35.730
Much better, Paige.

23:37.333 --> 23:37.399
Good.

23:41.709 --> 23:43.245
That's great.
That's beautiful.

23:43.245 --> 23:44.548
( both screaming )

23:46.251 --> 23:47.120
- Exactly!
- Yes!

23:47.120 --> 23:49.591
♪ Hey, eh, eh ♪

23:49.591 --> 23:53.533
Marissa!
You look amazing!

23:53.533 --> 23:58.275
Ooh, thank you.
I'm ready to box for sure.

23:58.275 --> 24:00.279
Honestly, it was
a little nerve-racking

24:00.279 --> 24:03.051
to shoot in front
of a really hot celebrity.

24:03.051 --> 24:04.855
<i>Like, this is crazy.</i>

24:04.855 --> 24:05.355
This is the winning
team over here.

24:08.461 --> 24:13.607
Marissa came on set
with a positive attitude,

24:13.607 --> 24:16.378
<i>which is great because
you feel connected</i>

24:16.378 --> 24:18.583
and you can get good vibes
for the shot.

24:18.583 --> 24:20.787
What it's looking like
is this.

24:20.787 --> 24:22.757
- Go in. Go for it.
- Okay.

24:22.757 --> 24:23.626
- Awesome! You got it.
- Thank you so much.

24:26.932 --> 24:28.636
Oh, you're great.
You rocked it.

24:30.707 --> 24:33.746
Ashley:
Good job, Marissa.

24:33.746 --> 24:36.585
Don't pose for my picture,
but keep it moving with her.

24:38.489 --> 24:39.658
Try to swing back at her.

24:43.432 --> 24:45.503
That is sad, Kyle.
More grace, grace, grace!

24:46.606 --> 24:48.943
This is, like,
so terrible.

24:51.515 --> 24:53.986
I didn't want to be
distracted by Marissa,

24:53.986 --> 24:55.623
<i>but she is stuck
in my freaking mind</i>

24:55.623 --> 24:57.660
and that kind
of drives me nuts.

24:58.930 --> 24:59.798
- Let's move on.
- Done.

25:04.073 --> 25:06.979
I was just definitely
not getting the shot
that they wanted.

25:06.979 --> 25:09.785
<i>I hope it's not
too little, too late,</i>

25:09.785 --> 25:10.352
otherwise I will be
the next one out the door.

25:11.622 --> 25:12.757
I'm not in the mood,
Courtney. Like, I'm not.

25:17.033 --> 25:18.769
And I've all ready told
you, don't mess with me when I'm
not in the mood.

25:18.769 --> 25:21.307
I'm not ( bleep )
talking to you!

25:34.735 --> 25:39.176
Krislian:
I'm really feeling
the pressure

25:39.176 --> 25:40.445
<i>with today's shoot.</i>

25:40.445 --> 25:41.448
I've never boxed
in my life.

25:41.448 --> 25:43.553
<i>I'm not athletic, really.</i>

25:43.553 --> 25:45.489
I hardly ever work out.
I'm more of a dancer.

25:45.489 --> 25:48.529
- This is a big one.
- Yes.

25:48.529 --> 25:50.465
- You've gotta nail this
one. - I do. I know.

25:50.465 --> 25:53.338
Just need to, like, kick ass.

25:53.338 --> 25:55.711
- Woo!
- And, action.

25:55.711 --> 25:58.849
A little less posing.
More action and power.

26:00.553 --> 26:01.688
Height could be an issue,
so don't--

26:05.228 --> 26:07.399
there's no need
to go down. Stay up.

26:07.399 --> 26:08.368
Krislian,
she just came on set.

26:11.408 --> 26:13.011
<i>She knew what
she wanted to do,</i>

26:13.011 --> 26:13.979
but nothing translated.

26:13.979 --> 26:16.251
Powerful face.

26:16.251 --> 26:17.554
Switch up your face
a little bit, remember?

26:17.554 --> 26:19.691
Now, expression in your eyes.

26:19.691 --> 26:21.060
Powerful face.
So what if that's not right?

26:21.060 --> 26:23.399
But does it
look good in the photo?

26:23.399 --> 26:25.235
You gonna get on
the cover of "Vogue"? Yes.

26:25.235 --> 26:27.240
Attitude in the frown.
Get ugly.

26:27.240 --> 26:30.914
- We should move on.
- I got this.

26:30.914 --> 26:32.249
India:
I wanna get best photo
really badly.

26:34.922 --> 26:36.859
I'm ready to stand out.

26:36.859 --> 26:38.562
Make yourself tall. Yes.

26:38.562 --> 26:42.470
More action.
Boom! Boom! Boom!

26:42.470 --> 26:46.211
Cody, Chanel.
Chanel, Cody.

26:46.211 --> 26:47.914
Chanel freaking Iman.

26:47.914 --> 26:49.885
Here we go.

26:49.885 --> 26:51.956
Get it. Get it, girl!

26:51.956 --> 26:53.458
Cody:
<i>I saw her shooting for
all the high end brands</i>

26:53.458 --> 26:55.797
<i>that I wanted
to shoot with.</i>

26:55.797 --> 26:57.399
<i>And she just made me
feel like</i>

26:57.399 --> 26:58.268
this kind of stuff
was possible.

26:58.268 --> 27:00.640
Yeah, let's go!

27:00.640 --> 27:03.579
That's sick.
We got this one.

27:03.579 --> 27:04.815
Got it?
Good job, ladies!

27:04.815 --> 27:06.552
( cheering )

27:06.552 --> 27:07.787
All right, guys,
that's a wrap.

27:13.799 --> 27:18.208
CoryAnne:
<i>I'm anxious for panel.</i>

27:18.208 --> 27:19.978
You did great.
I watched you.

27:19.978 --> 27:21.549
- You did?
- Uh-huh.

27:21.549 --> 27:23.252
The judges have
high expectations of me,

27:23.252 --> 27:25.089
so I have to keep
doing really well in shoots,

27:25.089 --> 27:27.393
<i>because at the
end of the day</i>

27:27.393 --> 27:28.495
<i>I just want
to make them proud.</i>

27:28.495 --> 27:29.497
The more days
we have to wait,

27:29.497 --> 27:31.835
the weirder
I feel about it.

27:31.835 --> 27:33.338
I go from confident
to not confident.
You know what I mean?

27:33.338 --> 27:35.677
You just let
your mind wander
way too much.

27:35.677 --> 27:37.747
That was torturous.
You kind of just
want it to happen.

27:37.747 --> 27:39.483
I wish panel would happen
right after your shoot.

27:39.483 --> 27:40.285
Rub my head the way you
rubbed it the first time.

27:42.490 --> 27:44.662
Are you hyped
up right now?

27:44.662 --> 27:45.161
Yes, I'm riddled
with anxiety.

27:49.437 --> 27:53.780
Kyle definitely is
a very affectionate person,

27:53.780 --> 27:56.317
which typically I'm not.

27:56.317 --> 27:57.186
<i>I do need space,
as any human being would.</i>

27:57.186 --> 28:00.158
I am like a light switch.

28:00.158 --> 28:00.458
I flip it on
and I flip it off.

28:02.664 --> 28:06.304
Kyle, leave me
the ( bleep ) alone.

28:06.304 --> 28:08.141
What the ( bleep )?

28:08.141 --> 28:10.212
Marissa has
a little bit of a temper

28:10.212 --> 28:11.448
and that's actually
something I'm going to try

28:11.448 --> 28:13.218
to work on with her,

28:13.218 --> 28:14.453
<i>so I kind of want
to talk to her.</i>

28:14.453 --> 28:16.992
- I don't have that.
- What have I done wrong?

28:16.992 --> 28:17.995
What am I apologizing
for right now?

28:17.995 --> 28:19.965
You are apologizing

28:19.965 --> 28:21.802
for just being so needy
and just so annoying.

28:21.802 --> 28:25.643
Kyle and Marissa
are around each other 24/7.

28:25.643 --> 28:28.381
<i>So eventually things
are gonna crack</i>

28:28.381 --> 28:31.320
<i>and go a little
bit crazy.</i>

28:31.320 --> 28:32.389
Kyle:
Ugh, you are difficult.

28:32.389 --> 28:34.561
I'm not being difficult.

28:34.561 --> 28:36.330
I don't jump
when Kyle says jump.

28:36.330 --> 28:38.636
What?
What did I even--
Jesus God.

28:38.636 --> 28:40.874
You're out of your
( bleep ) mind.

28:40.874 --> 28:43.044
What?

28:43.044 --> 28:45.517
What the ( bleep ), Marissa?

28:45.517 --> 28:47.587
Yeah, I don't know.
I just...

28:47.587 --> 28:50.025
If I were you,
I would just separate
yourself and go to bed,

28:50.025 --> 28:52.563
because I feel like that
wasn't a calm conversation.

28:52.563 --> 28:55.168
( imitates
suspenseful music )

28:55.168 --> 28:56.973
I don't know where
that came from.

28:56.973 --> 28:59.009
- I really am
just so thrown off.
- ( bleep ).

28:59.009 --> 29:01.582
I have an attitude,
and, yes, I may explode,
at times, but, like--

29:01.582 --> 29:04.086
You probably feel
so much better, though.

29:04.086 --> 29:05.489
No? A little bit?

29:05.489 --> 29:07.326
Like, what the ( bleep )?

29:07.326 --> 29:09.230
I don't wanna
talk about this.

29:09.230 --> 29:11.100
It's annoying
and it doesn't need to be
talked about anymore.

29:11.100 --> 29:12.904
We can just
wake up tomorrow
like nothing happened.

29:12.904 --> 29:14.373
Don't get all riled up then.

29:19.685 --> 29:24.594
- Got it, Kyle.
- Got it, girl! Walk away!

29:24.594 --> 29:28.736
Like, I'm not
in the mood, Courtney.

29:28.736 --> 29:30.674
Like, I'm not,
and I've already told you

29:30.674 --> 29:32.409
don't mess with me
when I'm not in the mood.

29:32.409 --> 29:33.846
I already know
how you are.

29:33.846 --> 29:36.217
Like, ( bleep ).

29:36.217 --> 29:38.088
Get out of
my goddamn visual.
I don't want to see you.

29:38.088 --> 29:40.092
Like, everybody wants me
to be the bad guy,
and it's kind--

29:40.092 --> 29:42.764
Hey, look, Marissa--

29:42.764 --> 29:44.735
I'm not ( bleep )
talking to you!

29:44.735 --> 29:47.039
I am having a conversation
in the ( bleep ) living room,

29:47.039 --> 29:50.780
and I all ready told you
I'm not talking to you.

29:50.780 --> 29:53.819
So mind your
goddamn business.
I didn't say your name.

29:53.819 --> 29:56.759
I wasn't saying ( bleep )
about you. Okay?

29:56.759 --> 29:59.597
God, you're
the ( bleep ) victim.

29:59.597 --> 30:01.434
I'm gonna make you look
like the ( bleep ) victim

30:01.434 --> 30:02.302
if you say another
( bleep ) word.

30:22.944 --> 30:27.954
- Hello, ladies.
- Hi.

30:27.954 --> 30:30.527
This week was all about
body image and body strength.

30:30.527 --> 30:33.933
and you got to hang out
with Ashley,

30:33.933 --> 30:36.037
who's very passionate
about this topic.

30:36.037 --> 30:38.341
Then, in the boxing ring,
you battled it out

30:38.341 --> 30:39.945
with supermodel Chanel Iman
in an edgy editorial.

30:39.945 --> 30:44.353
Now, let's say hello
to our judges, shall we?

30:44.353 --> 30:46.658
Gorgeous super model
and body activist,
Ashley Graham.

30:46.658 --> 30:50.199
Our own amazing image
architect to the stars, Law
Roach.

30:50.199 --> 30:54.373
And our incredible
creative consultant

30:54.373 --> 30:56.210
and Chief Creative Officer
at "Paper Magazine,"
Drew Elliot.

30:56.210 --> 30:59.116
The winner of "Next Top Model"
will receive $100,000

30:59.116 --> 31:02.858
and be featured in a commercial
thanks to Rimmel London.

31:02.858 --> 31:05.996
In addition, the winner
will also be featured

31:05.996 --> 31:08.235
in a fashion spread
thanks to "Paper Magazine,"

31:08.235 --> 31:09.772
and get an exclusive
one-year talent deal with VH1.

31:09.772 --> 31:14.648
So, first up, Cody.

31:14.648 --> 31:18.221
Can I just say,
your current wave going on
in this competition

31:18.221 --> 31:22.898
- is really becoming
prominent, am I right?
- I agree.

31:22.898 --> 31:25.202
Rita:
Should we take a look
at your best shot?

31:25.202 --> 31:28.474
- Wow.
- So good.

31:28.474 --> 31:30.012
Rita: I love it.
I love how strong you look
in this photograph.

31:30.012 --> 31:33.919
You really look like
you're holding your own.

31:33.919 --> 31:36.926
Law:
You're literally
standing next to

31:36.926 --> 31:38.729
one of the most beautiful
women in the world

31:38.729 --> 31:40.933
and you're not
intimidated at all.

31:40.933 --> 31:42.870
- So you suck.
- Thank you, Cody.

31:42.870 --> 31:44.975
- Thank you, Cody.
- Thank you, guys.

31:44.975 --> 31:47.379
Next up, Courtney.
Should we take a look?

31:47.379 --> 31:50.319
Drew:
This isn't my favorite shoot
that you've done.

31:50.319 --> 31:53.024
Can we get
diversity from you

31:53.024 --> 31:54.862
beyond just that cold face
that you're amazing at doing?

31:54.862 --> 31:59.605
Rita:
It's all about
being relatable.

31:59.605 --> 32:00.740
You really just have to
find it in you

32:00.740 --> 32:03.178
to just be connecting

32:03.178 --> 32:04.548
with at least something
or someone, you know?

32:04.548 --> 32:07.353
- Thank you very much.
- Thank you.

32:07.353 --> 32:10.559
- Kyle.
- Go, Kyle! Go, Kyle!

32:10.559 --> 32:14.534
- In a heel.
- Careful. Okay.

32:14.534 --> 32:18.943
Rita:
Let's have a look.

32:18.943 --> 32:20.011
Ashley:
This was a rough day
for you, wasn't it?

32:20.011 --> 32:21.849
Kyle: Yeah.

32:21.849 --> 32:23.118
I think it would
have been easier

32:23.118 --> 32:25.255
if there was
an openness about you.

32:25.255 --> 32:28.127
And I'm really proud
of you today-- the heels.

32:28.127 --> 32:30.299
But I really wish
it would have come
a little bit sooner.

32:30.299 --> 32:33.806
I think you can
agree with me

32:33.806 --> 32:35.643
in saying this isn't
your best shot.

32:35.643 --> 32:36.978
There comes a time
where are you different
enough to succeed?

32:36.978 --> 32:40.619
It's getting close
to crunch point.

32:40.619 --> 32:42.456
These pictures just
have to come through,

32:42.456 --> 32:44.159
and this one,
it just isn't.

32:44.159 --> 32:45.830
- Yeah, thank you, guys.
- Next up, Marissa.

32:45.830 --> 32:49.671
It's strong and fun
at the same time.

32:49.671 --> 32:52.042
This has definitely
got great energy.

32:52.042 --> 32:53.879
It's like oozing
energy out of it,

32:53.879 --> 32:55.983
which is always
a positive for me.

32:55.983 --> 32:57.820
You guys just look
like you've known
each other for ages.

32:57.820 --> 32:59.658
I love how you stand
in front of us

32:59.658 --> 33:01.661
and you look like a baby
and a little girl.

33:01.661 --> 33:03.464
But when you get to the
photo? That's a grown woman.

33:03.464 --> 33:06.671
- Mm-hmm.
- Thank you.

33:06.671 --> 33:07.673
Tatiana.
I like those jeans.

33:07.673 --> 33:12.082
It's fabulous.

33:12.082 --> 33:14.186
You almost look like
we just picked you
out of the wild.

33:14.186 --> 33:16.090
This is the strongest
photograph of you
I've seen so far.

33:16.090 --> 33:19.296
- Thank you.
- I would've liked to see

33:19.296 --> 33:20.833
a little bit more diversity
in your face

33:20.833 --> 33:23.539
and your hands
and actions in this shot,

33:23.539 --> 33:26.010
because it was a lot
of the same thing.

33:26.010 --> 33:28.181
But I think that just
comes with time.

33:28.181 --> 33:29.751
- Thank you, guys.
- Law: Bye, pumpkin.

33:29.751 --> 33:32.089
Rita:
Next up, Paige.

33:32.089 --> 33:34.293
Law: The photo
is really interesting

33:34.293 --> 33:35.863
because I really don't see
Chanel in it at all.

33:35.863 --> 33:38.100
You're being photographed
with a supermodel

33:38.100 --> 33:40.038
and that's
really hard to do. Bravo.

33:40.038 --> 33:42.375
Drew: I think from
the photo shoot perspective,

33:42.375 --> 33:44.681
we had to change the shoot

33:44.681 --> 33:46.050
so that we could get
a good picture from you.

33:46.050 --> 33:48.388
Because you couldn't
hit that photo,

33:48.388 --> 33:49.791
and it was
so blatantly clear

33:49.791 --> 33:52.196
that I was like,
"Let's change directions

33:52.196 --> 33:53.866
and do what
a cheerleader would do
and let's do jump rope."

33:53.866 --> 33:57.038
- You gotta nail it
every time.
- Totally.

33:57.038 --> 33:58.775
You have it in you,
so we gotta see more.

33:58.775 --> 34:00.880
- Absolutely.
- Rita: Thank you.

34:00.880 --> 34:02.282
Next up, Binta.
Let's have a look.

34:02.282 --> 34:05.556
- Power!
- It's powerful, Binta.

34:05.556 --> 34:07.727
This is definitely
a fighting for
attention photograph.

34:07.727 --> 34:11.034
Law:
I really hate to say this,

34:11.034 --> 34:12.402
but I'm becoming a little
bored with you, Binta.

34:12.402 --> 34:15.909
I'm sorry, I am.

34:15.909 --> 34:17.580
I'm thinking,
like, is your photos,
is your personality,

34:17.580 --> 34:20.920
is your presence
strong enough to compete

34:20.920 --> 34:23.526
with some of the other girls
that have the exact same look.

34:23.526 --> 34:25.529
I would love for you
to turn it up some type of way
that changes my mind.

34:26.364 --> 34:30.806
Rita: India.

34:30.806 --> 34:32.910
Drew:
Chanel looks amazing

34:32.910 --> 34:34.480
is what I would say
about this photo.

34:34.480 --> 34:36.016
Rita:
You almost should have
changed positions.

34:36.016 --> 34:38.188
It's, like, you are
so great now in person,

34:38.188 --> 34:40.859
and you just don't give me
the best photos.

34:40.859 --> 34:43.097
I wasn't feeling
comfortable.

34:43.097 --> 34:44.767
I should have talked
to the photographer.

34:44.767 --> 34:45.936
I tried to keep my face
good in every single shot

34:45.936 --> 34:48.609
so you could pick
the one where--

34:48.609 --> 34:49.711
You don't even have to
try with your face.

34:49.711 --> 34:50.846
It's more about your presence

34:50.846 --> 34:52.784
and your body and your angles.

34:52.784 --> 34:54.287
I thought giving you
hair color was gonna help you,

34:54.287 --> 34:57.092
but I still feel like
you're not elevating.

34:57.092 --> 34:59.964
Your style is way better
than Chanel's was,

34:59.964 --> 35:04.072
but she steals the
picture. This is her shoot.

35:04.072 --> 35:06.945
This isn't India's shoot,
unfortunately.

35:06.945 --> 35:09.951
Next up, Krislian.
Let's have a look.

35:09.951 --> 35:13.959
Ashley:
You're not a traditional
high end editorial model,

35:13.959 --> 35:17.767
but in this photo
you gave life.

35:17.767 --> 35:19.403
- I'm so proud of you.
- Thank you so much.

35:19.403 --> 35:21.809
I feel like
you're crumpled in.

35:21.809 --> 35:23.812
I mean, look at Chanel,
for example.

35:23.812 --> 35:25.315
See how her body is longed out
and how she uses her limbs?

35:25.315 --> 35:29.892
She knows what works for her.

35:29.892 --> 35:31.795
Because you are
not the typical body
stature of a model,

35:31.795 --> 35:36.170
you need to emphasize
that even more.

35:36.170 --> 35:39.977
- Thank you, Krislian.
- Thank you so much.

35:39.977 --> 35:42.216
CoryAnne,
shall we have a look?

35:42.216 --> 35:43.985
- Woo!
- Oh, wow!

35:43.985 --> 35:48.394
Yes! That's hot!

35:48.394 --> 35:50.733
- Thank you!
- Do you love it?

35:50.733 --> 35:53.973
- I love it.
- Rita: I can't tell.

35:53.973 --> 35:55.676
You're legs look like
they're never-ending.

35:55.676 --> 35:58.080
But what's amazing
is that I don't even look

35:58.080 --> 36:01.019
at Chanel for a second,
you know? And it's important.

36:01.019 --> 36:04.527
Did you just say,
"Oh, I forgot she was in it?"

36:04.527 --> 36:06.497
I, like, just--
I didn't mean it like that.

36:06.497 --> 36:07.967
I meant I didn't even
look at her yet.

36:07.967 --> 36:11.273
- It's okay.
- I'm just so proud

36:11.273 --> 36:13.779
that you've come out
of your shell at this point.

36:13.779 --> 36:16.685
So I'm happy.
Thanks, CoryAnne.

36:16.685 --> 36:18.756
Models,
you know how this goes.

36:18.756 --> 36:21.962
We will now have a chat

36:21.962 --> 36:23.364
and we will deliberate
on who gets best photo

36:23.364 --> 36:24.700
and who will be
packing up and leaving.

36:36.491 --> 36:41.200
Okay, guys,
let's talk about
who did the best

36:41.200 --> 36:43.939
and who did
the worst this week.

36:43.939 --> 36:46.010
Let's start off with Krislian.

36:46.010 --> 36:48.113
I have to be honest,
she's not making it
to the end.

36:48.113 --> 36:50.118
This is the thing,
I see something
special inside of her

36:50.118 --> 36:52.623
that keeps me saying,
"Keep her."

36:52.623 --> 36:55.462
You find
a connection with her

36:55.462 --> 36:57.299
because she very much
is your story.

36:57.299 --> 36:59.336
Is she America's
next Top Model?

36:59.336 --> 37:01.206
- I don't think so.
- Rita: India.

37:01.206 --> 37:04.079
Why has she not won
best photo yet?

37:04.079 --> 37:06.985
She's sexy, she's cute.

37:06.985 --> 37:09.691
But then again, it's,
like, give me some kind of grit.

37:09.691 --> 37:11.493
Give me something to hold onto.
Do you know what I'm saying?

37:11.493 --> 37:14.165
- CoryAnne.
- CoryAnne's photo.

37:14.165 --> 37:16.003
Rita: I'm so happy
with that photo.

37:16.003 --> 37:17.573
It's just oozing, like,

37:17.573 --> 37:20.045
"I'm growing up
right in front of my eyes."

37:20.045 --> 37:22.415
- Yes, yes.
- Kyle.

37:22.415 --> 37:24.654
She really is
making an effort,

37:24.654 --> 37:26.390
I know she is,
but I am so disappointed.

37:26.390 --> 37:29.162
I don't think Kyle
could stand up to the girls

37:29.162 --> 37:31.000
who have that look
who's working.

37:31.000 --> 37:32.703
If you put her
in a room with Ruby Rose,
you will not notice her.

37:32.703 --> 37:34.674
So, judges, what do we think
and have we decided?

37:37.045 --> 37:37.847
I think so.

37:42.389 --> 37:43.525
Models, welcome back.

37:47.032 --> 37:49.036
The judges have deliberated.

37:49.036 --> 37:50.839
If I call your name,
you'll be staying another week

37:50.839 --> 37:53.612
to prove you have what it
takes to be the next Top Model.

37:53.612 --> 37:56.918
The first name
I'm going to call
is gonna have best photo.

37:56.918 --> 37:58.922
and that person is...

38:01.962 --> 38:03.264
CoryAnne.

38:06.236 --> 38:09.042
CoryAnne, it was amazing.

38:09.042 --> 38:11.447
Right now, you are one
of the ones to beat,

38:11.447 --> 38:13.151
along with the next name
I'm gonna call...

38:13.151 --> 38:15.221
Cody.

38:17.560 --> 38:19.162
Just so you know,
we had a hard time picking

38:19.162 --> 38:21.433
between you and CoryAnne.

38:21.433 --> 38:23.304
We are so looking
forward to seeing

38:23.304 --> 38:24.708
what you're
going to do next.

38:24.708 --> 38:26.444
Thank you.

38:26.444 --> 38:28.047
The next name
I'm going to call...

38:28.047 --> 38:29.884
Tatiana.

38:29.884 --> 38:31.053
Congratulations.

38:31.053 --> 38:32.624
Marissa.

38:32.624 --> 38:33.457
Courtney.

38:35.228 --> 38:36.396
Paige.

38:40.104 --> 38:43.946
Four girls left.

38:43.946 --> 38:46.584
Binta.

38:47.753 --> 38:48.320
The next name
I'm going to call is...

38:51.928 --> 38:53.765
India.

38:56.203 --> 38:57.138
- I like your shoes.
- Thank you.

38:59.977 --> 39:02.516
Models always got high heels.

39:02.516 --> 39:03.317
Will Kyle and Krislian
please step forward?

39:09.262 --> 39:13.772
Krislian, the transition
that you've made

39:13.772 --> 39:17.145
from where you started
to where you are now,

39:17.145 --> 39:19.684
I mean, it makes us so proud.

39:19.684 --> 39:21.654
It was incredible to
watch. But the judges?

39:21.654 --> 39:25.195
We're concerned that
you've reached your peak.

39:25.195 --> 39:28.869
Kyle, this week
was almost a bust for you.

39:28.869 --> 39:33.143
It's so clear to all of us
that you're trying hard.

39:33.143 --> 39:36.350
But the question is,
is that enough?

39:37.052 --> 39:38.454
So, congratulations...

39:44.968 --> 39:49.309
Kyle.

39:49.309 --> 39:51.814
You've made it another week,

39:51.814 --> 39:53.484
and you still have a
chance to become next Top Model.

39:53.484 --> 39:56.189
- Thank you.
- Congratulations.

39:58.929 --> 39:59.664
- I'm sorry, Krislian.
- That's okay.

40:03.505 --> 40:05.241
Please remember what we said.

40:05.241 --> 40:07.078
When you watch this back,

40:07.078 --> 40:08.882
you won't even
recognize yourself.

40:08.882 --> 40:09.850
You've just turned into
a whole 'nother woman.

40:10.753 --> 40:15.596
Thank you so much.

40:15.596 --> 40:17.231
Thank you for being a part
of "America's Next Top Model."

40:17.231 --> 40:19.336
- Thanks. Thank you.
- Thank you.

40:19.336 --> 40:21.406
Say good-bye to the girls.

40:24.012 --> 40:28.421
Krislian:
I fought very hard
to be here.

40:28.421 --> 40:31.694
<i>I tried to adapt
to this look.</i>

40:31.694 --> 40:34.066
<i>I changed my style.
I practiced every day.</i>

40:34.066 --> 40:37.239
<i>I know I'm stronger than
this, and it's not gonna stop
me.</i>

40:37.239 --> 40:41.347
Thank you for everything.

40:41.347 --> 40:42.616
<i>No one thought I was
gonna make it this far.</i>

40:42.616 --> 40:43.183
Bigger, better things
in my future.

40:58.214 --> 41:01.955
It's important for you
to learn how to move.

41:01.955 --> 41:03.591
The best way to learn
how to move is through dance.

41:03.591 --> 41:05.461
I want you to meet
Beyoncé's personal
choreographer.

41:05.461 --> 41:09.302
All right, so here we go.

41:09.302 --> 41:11.273
You're a model
first and foremost.

41:11.273 --> 41:12.977
A lot of you got lost
in the dance.

41:12.977 --> 41:15.916
Today we're going to
be creating a music video.

41:15.916 --> 41:18.220
It's all about that
connection you have with the
camera.

41:18.220 --> 41:21.394
Give us something.
Give us something.

41:21.394 --> 41:22.997
- You're not listening.
- I'm trying to listen.

41:22.997 --> 41:24.667
Keep the pretty lips shut.

41:24.667 --> 41:26.839
You're as good
as your last job.

41:26.839 --> 41:28.474
Do not forget that.

41:30.946 --> 41:34.520
<i>We see your beauty.</i>
