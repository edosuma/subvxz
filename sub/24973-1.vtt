00:55.340 --> 00:57.630
- The Allied
forces struck a major blow

00:57.630 --> 00:59.340
against the enemy today.

00:59.340 --> 01:02.830
Pushing to trap the occupied
French line into Germany

01:02.830 --> 01:06.170
driving back Axis forces even farther.

01:06.170 --> 01:08.370
A massive ground and air assault

01:08.370 --> 01:11.223
put Germans fleeing deeper into retreat.

01:12.140 --> 01:14.750
Bombings and artillery
fire prove once again

01:14.750 --> 01:16.600
the might of the American will

01:16.600 --> 01:19.140
to bring freedom to the nations.

01:19.140 --> 01:21.830
Heavily targeted were the German dam.

01:21.830 --> 01:25.410
Shelled until it burst open
unleashing a watery wall

01:25.410 --> 01:27.730
of destruction on a nearby town

01:27.730 --> 01:31.000
and suspected German base of operations.

01:31.000 --> 01:33.640
Severe damage to Germany's infrastructure

01:33.640 --> 01:35.750
helped Allies gain new ground

01:35.750 --> 01:39.800
in the ever failing forces
of Hitler's Third Reich.

01:39.800 --> 01:43.340
Thousands of German soldiers
surrendered to Allied forces

01:43.340 --> 01:48.190
hoping too that the war of
worlds will soon come to an end.

01:59.270 --> 02:00.270
- Nazi scum!

02:07.690 --> 02:11.003
I'm sending more of you to hell today!

02:50.020 --> 02:50.853
- Sarge!

02:50.853 --> 02:53.570
Lieutenant need you back
in headquarters right away!

02:53.570 --> 02:56.223
- Tell him I'm busy fighting his damn war!

02:56.223 --> 02:58.780
- I have direct orders to
bring you back immediately.

02:58.780 --> 03:01.278
After I shoot a few more krauts!

03:41.040 --> 03:42.500
All right, soldier.

03:42.500 --> 03:44.130
Lets go see what's so important,

03:44.130 --> 03:46.187
we have to stop fighting this damn war.

05:06.470 --> 05:07.630
- What's this?

05:07.630 --> 05:09.653
Leftovers from the ladies' club?

05:12.410 --> 05:14.360
- Did you forget who you're talking to?

05:16.610 --> 05:18.020
- Yes, sir.

05:18.020 --> 05:18.933
- At ease.

05:20.020 --> 05:22.750
- Why'd you pulled me off the battlefront?

05:22.750 --> 05:26.300
I can't win a war slack-jawing with you.

05:26.300 --> 05:28.070
- Something important has come up.

05:28.070 --> 05:29.343
Now, shut up and listen.

05:34.960 --> 05:36.603
- I'm all ears, lieutenant.

05:39.880 --> 05:43.330
- About a week ago, our air
force bombed a German dam.

05:43.330 --> 05:46.163
It wiped out a suspected
Nazi base and nearby town.

05:47.930 --> 05:49.750
- That's the good news.

05:49.750 --> 05:52.200
What's the bad news?

05:52.200 --> 05:54.310
- We have it on good
authority that the base

05:54.310 --> 05:56.730
had a strongbox filled
with secret German codes

05:56.730 --> 05:58.720
that the enemy's been using.

05:58.720 --> 06:00.340
- So?

06:00.340 --> 06:01.860
- If we can get that in our hands,

06:01.860 --> 06:03.750
we'd be on top of every message sent.

06:03.750 --> 06:05.220
We can crush the German force

06:05.220 --> 06:07.850
before they even have a chance to regroup.

06:07.850 --> 06:10.680
It would help the war effort immensely.

06:10.680 --> 06:14.060
Eisenhower wants this war over.

06:14.060 --> 06:18.010
- If he hasn't noticed,
we're already winning.

06:18.010 --> 06:19.700
Maybe you haven't noticed tucked away

06:19.700 --> 06:21.963
in this nice warm barracks.

06:23.820 --> 06:26.370
- Not everyone wants war
to last forever, sergeant.

06:27.840 --> 06:29.470
General Eisenhower has led

06:29.470 --> 06:33.440
the most successful war campaign
ever on the European front.

06:33.440 --> 06:35.810
Don't forget what he did in Africa.

06:35.810 --> 06:37.453
He would do the same here.

06:41.220 --> 06:43.493
- These greenbacks looks scared.

06:48.330 --> 06:52.070
- Well, for the next five
days, they are your men.

06:52.070 --> 06:54.490
And you're going on a
mission to get those codes.

06:54.490 --> 06:55.323
Understood?

06:57.012 --> 06:59.193
- It'd be better off if I went alone.

07:00.170 --> 07:02.380
We'd stand a better chance.

07:02.380 --> 07:03.860
- I'm not asking you.

07:03.860 --> 07:05.190
I'm telling you.

07:05.190 --> 07:06.653
That's a direct order.

07:07.570 --> 07:08.563
- Yes, sir.

07:10.840 --> 07:12.650
- Let me introduce them.

07:12.650 --> 07:13.483
This is--

07:13.483 --> 07:14.453
- Don't bother.

07:15.730 --> 07:17.653
They'll be dead within a day.

07:19.000 --> 07:24.000
Just give me the, I mean us, the briefing.

07:27.500 --> 07:28.333
- Gather around.

07:35.860 --> 07:37.540
Here's our position.

07:37.540 --> 07:39.950
It's about 20 miles stretch to the dam

07:39.950 --> 07:43.220
then about another mile or
so to the destroyed base.

07:43.220 --> 07:45.220
There are pockets of Germans throughout.

07:46.641 --> 07:49.883
Go in, get the codes and get back here.

07:50.900 --> 07:52.900
Then you can go back to the front lines.

07:52.900 --> 07:55.200
Get shot for all I care.

07:55.200 --> 07:57.140
- What happens if we get captured.

07:57.140 --> 07:58.420
- Captured?

07:58.420 --> 07:59.683
- Yeah, captured.

08:00.700 --> 08:03.000
This is a war, you know?

08:03.000 --> 08:04.950
- You have your orders, sergeant.

08:04.950 --> 08:06.363
You move out in one hour.

08:07.300 --> 08:11.233
Don't let your country,
me or Eisenhower down.

08:12.700 --> 08:13.543
- I won't.

08:15.810 --> 08:18.783
I'm not so sure about
these scaredy cat brigade.

08:26.650 --> 08:27.940
- Don't worry, boys.

08:27.940 --> 08:29.500
You're in good hands.

08:29.500 --> 08:30.970
No one is more capable than him

08:30.970 --> 08:33.289
to get you there and back safely.

08:33.289 --> 08:34.169
Good luck.

08:34.169 --> 08:35.003
Dismissed.

08:42.890 --> 08:43.873
God help them.

08:50.760 --> 08:52.240
- What's the matter soldier?

08:52.240 --> 08:54.080
Shouldn't you be getting
ready to move out?

08:54.080 --> 08:55.580
- I already am.

08:55.580 --> 08:58.190
Second time in a week I've
been move to a new unit.

08:58.190 --> 08:59.173
- Misfit, huh?

09:00.040 --> 09:00.873
What's the matter?

09:00.873 --> 09:02.190
They couldn't find a good place for you

09:02.190 --> 09:04.000
to get shot to pieces?

09:04.000 --> 09:07.027
- I can take care of myself
and I'm not afraid to die.

09:08.524 --> 09:10.300
- Who are you fooling, kid?

09:10.300 --> 09:12.780
Everyone is afraid to die.

09:12.780 --> 09:14.380
- The good lord will protect us.

09:16.020 --> 09:18.610
- Go on over to the Red
Cross hospital there.

09:18.610 --> 09:20.093
Think about what you said.

09:21.020 --> 09:22.950
God must've been out to lunch the day

09:22.950 --> 09:25.790
those poor boys got massacred.

09:25.790 --> 09:27.300
- Don't believe in god?

09:27.300 --> 09:28.513
- I believe in this.

09:29.840 --> 09:33.010
And you should too if you
wanna get outta here alive.

09:33.010 --> 09:33.843
Got it?

09:48.630 --> 09:49.730
- Hi, I'm Wyoming.

09:49.730 --> 09:50.750
- Hey, I'm MacInroy.

09:50.750 --> 09:52.380
Nice to meet you.

09:52.380 --> 09:54.000
Looks like you got the radio pack, huh?

09:54.000 --> 09:55.600
- Yeah, someone's gotta do it.

09:55.600 --> 09:56.570
What do you got there?

09:56.570 --> 10:00.180
- Oh, this is a 16
millimeter newsreel camera.

10:00.180 --> 10:02.040
I film the action and send the photos back

10:02.040 --> 10:02.890
to the government.

10:02.890 --> 10:04.600
They edit it into these new stories

10:04.600 --> 10:08.110
so folks back home can
watch at the picture houses.

10:08.110 --> 10:09.410
- What do you shoot?

10:09.410 --> 10:10.500
- Anything and everything.

10:10.500 --> 10:11.770
I try to document it all.

10:11.770 --> 10:14.470
This thing saved my life back on Normandy.

10:14.470 --> 10:16.830
I shot footage of the
entire fight up the cliff.

10:16.830 --> 10:19.150
A bullet hit the camera and bounced off.

10:19.150 --> 10:21.480
Three guys in front of
me have blown up though.

10:21.480 --> 10:23.100
- Nah, that's not for me.

10:23.100 --> 10:24.970
Too close without a gun.

10:24.970 --> 10:26.273
- I've done okay so far.

10:27.270 --> 10:28.580
You scared?

10:28.580 --> 10:29.413
- Yeah, you?

10:30.690 --> 10:32.270
- Yeah, me too.

10:32.270 --> 10:33.520
- How was it on Normandy?

10:34.430 --> 10:36.360
- We went in by the boatloads.

10:36.360 --> 10:39.190
First couple of landings,
didn't stand a chance.

10:39.190 --> 10:41.030
Killed almost instantly.

10:41.030 --> 10:43.770
We kept pushing through
and up the cliff though.

10:43.770 --> 10:45.370
Krauts didn't think we'd make it.

10:45.370 --> 10:46.810
You should've seen the look on their face

10:46.810 --> 10:47.990
when they're to surrender.

10:47.990 --> 10:50.803
I hear, we might actually
meet up with Russian Red Army.

10:52.200 --> 10:53.340
- Get over here!

10:53.340 --> 10:54.973
This isn't social hour.

11:02.640 --> 11:07.000
Names so I can fill out the reports later

11:07.000 --> 11:08.610
once you're killed.

11:08.610 --> 11:09.630
- Buford.

11:09.630 --> 11:10.640
- MacInroy.

11:10.640 --> 11:12.000
- Wyoming.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.200
- Good.

11:13.200 --> 11:15.630
You'll address me as Sarge.

11:15.630 --> 11:17.883
We're not gonna be friends or buddies.

11:19.030 --> 11:22.120
You'll follow my orders explicitly.

11:22.120 --> 11:24.953
I want a smooth, clean operation.

11:25.970 --> 11:29.833
No one thinks without
me telling you first.

11:31.120 --> 11:33.050
Every Nazi is an enemy.

11:33.050 --> 11:35.430
And we're gonna have to
kill a few along the way.

11:35.430 --> 11:36.883
So get that straight.

11:39.490 --> 11:43.053
You keep your personal belief
and convictions to yourself.

11:44.100 --> 11:46.993
This is war and war is hell.

11:48.960 --> 11:52.183
And we're about to take
a deeper step into it.

11:54.940 --> 11:55.993
Now, let's move out.

14:26.550 --> 14:27.833
- Shut up, take cover.

14:58.310 --> 14:59.911
German plane.

14:59.911 --> 15:01.560
- How could you tell?

15:01.560 --> 15:02.903
- Cheap engine sound.

15:36.860 --> 15:38.630
What the hell was that?

15:38.630 --> 15:41.430
There been more than two
of them, we'd be dead.

15:41.430 --> 15:44.543
MacInroy, shoot with your
gun, not your camera.

15:46.160 --> 15:47.960
Did you shoot at them of the ground?

15:48.830 --> 15:49.713
- Them, Sarge.

15:50.990 --> 15:54.070
- I could've swore I saw
your bullets hit the ground.

15:54.070 --> 15:56.003
You're not afraid to kill, are you?

15:57.670 --> 16:00.863
It's okay to kill by
god in the time of war.

16:02.299 --> 16:03.940
You didn't shoot at all.

16:03.940 --> 16:05.640
- I froze, Sarge.

16:05.640 --> 16:06.473
- Froze?

16:07.780 --> 16:10.510
You'd think they woulda
hesitated to kill you?

16:10.510 --> 16:11.343
Well?

16:12.230 --> 16:13.710
- You look good on camera, Sarge.

16:13.710 --> 16:16.603
- Shut up before I ram that
camera down your throat.

16:17.470 --> 16:18.560
Get it together.

16:18.560 --> 16:19.393
All of you.

16:20.250 --> 16:22.690
Next time we encounter the enemy,

16:22.690 --> 16:25.143
act like men, not children.

16:49.690 --> 16:50.940
- What do you see, Sarge?

16:54.690 --> 16:56.410
- An old barn.

16:56.410 --> 16:58.410
- Could be full of krauts.

16:58.410 --> 17:01.160
- Well, then we'll have to
give them a welcoming party.

18:09.040 --> 18:10.020
- All clear.

18:10.020 --> 18:11.011
- Same here.

18:11.011 --> 18:12.361
- Let's take a look inside.

18:57.980 --> 18:59.540
It's getting dark.

18:59.540 --> 19:01.270
Let's station here for the night.

19:01.270 --> 19:02.227
- Yes, Sarge.

19:22.010 --> 19:24.240
- This is Leader One to base.

19:24.240 --> 19:25.860
Leader One to base.

19:25.860 --> 19:27.340
- We receive you, Leader One.

19:27.340 --> 19:29.250
This is Base Command.

19:29.250 --> 19:31.600
What is the progress of your mission?

19:31.600 --> 19:33.550
- We're hunkered down for the night.

19:33.550 --> 19:36.060
Making advances towards the directive.

19:36.060 --> 19:38.340
No American casualties.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.050
- Proceed as planned.

19:40.050 --> 19:41.323
Report back tomorrow.

19:42.440 --> 19:43.420
- Yes, sir.

19:43.420 --> 19:44.253
Over and out.

19:57.954 --> 19:59.500
- You know something, Wyoming?

19:59.500 --> 20:00.460
This footage I'm shooting

20:00.460 --> 20:03.820
could help document this crazy
war for generations to come.

20:03.820 --> 20:04.653
- What do you think

20:04.653 --> 20:05.680
they'll do with all these footage?

20:05.680 --> 20:07.140
- Show it people.

20:07.140 --> 20:10.200
So if down the road, we don't
end up in the same boat again.

20:10.200 --> 20:11.780
World wars.

20:11.780 --> 20:13.430
Hey, we will be famous.

20:13.430 --> 20:15.240
You're in some of these footage enough.

20:15.240 --> 20:16.073
- I don't wanna be famous.

20:16.073 --> 20:17.800
I just wanna come home.

20:17.800 --> 20:19.560
- What you got back there?

20:19.560 --> 20:21.893
- A job, a family, a future.

20:23.100 --> 20:26.620
- My future is in television,
I wanna be a news cameraman.

20:26.620 --> 20:28.600
- You got a good start.

20:28.600 --> 20:30.650
- What do you wanna do when you get back?

20:32.260 --> 20:34.920
- I just wanna find a
beach, sit down in the sand,

20:34.920 --> 20:37.270
have the ocean breeze on my face.

20:37.270 --> 20:38.600
That'd be great.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.070
- Certainly, it would.

20:40.070 --> 20:42.370
Hey, throw in some gas and I'll join you.

20:42.370 --> 20:44.470
Now, there are some fine ladies in France

20:44.470 --> 20:46.600
and when we liberated them from the Nazis,

20:46.600 --> 20:50.110
they're more than complementary
if you know what I mean.

20:50.110 --> 20:52.810
- All right, let's hit the sack.

20:52.810 --> 20:55.320
Tomorrow's another wonderful day

20:55.320 --> 20:56.593
and we need to be ready.

21:18.730 --> 21:22.250
- My forever girl,
I miss and love you dearly.

21:22.250 --> 21:24.410
This war business is all messed up.

21:24.410 --> 21:25.670
The battlefield is chaos

21:25.670 --> 21:28.000
and there's blood and death everywhere.

21:28.000 --> 21:30.860
I have kept my faith and
hold fast to your love

21:30.860 --> 21:32.433
knowing we'll be together soon.

21:33.340 --> 21:34.860
I haven't mentioned a word to anyone

21:34.860 --> 21:36.910
about my wanting to be a minister and all.

21:36.910 --> 21:41.430
I don't think anyone mixed
up in this sees god anywhere.

21:41.430 --> 21:44.330
I'm on a daring mission
now, can't reveal to much

21:44.330 --> 21:45.680
but we have to retrieve something

21:45.680 --> 21:48.003
of utmost importance to war effort.

21:49.030 --> 21:50.930
Our sergeant loves this game.

21:50.930 --> 21:53.460
Shoots Nazis like we swat flies back home.

21:53.460 --> 21:54.813
Doesn't even flinch.

21:55.670 --> 21:58.750
Thank god, I haven't been
forced to do that yet.

21:58.750 --> 22:02.660
I pray everyday, god will
spare me a situation like that.

22:02.660 --> 22:06.150
I never want to take the
life of another human being.

22:06.150 --> 22:08.550
The Ten Commandments
state we shall not kill.

22:08.550 --> 22:10.823
If yet, when war stamped on it, it's okay?

22:11.800 --> 22:14.520
I'm conflicted but we'll hold my ground.

22:14.520 --> 22:17.563
How can you be a minister if
you've taken a life needlessly?

22:18.410 --> 22:20.237
Lights out so I gotta go.

22:20.237 --> 22:22.153
All my love, Buford.

22:51.250 --> 22:52.400
- You guys ever smoked?

22:54.400 --> 22:55.683
Well, you do now.

23:03.640 --> 23:05.040
That's a cure what ails you.

23:19.115 --> 23:21.698
Afraidy cat brigade right here.

24:38.180 --> 24:40.120
- Don't worry, kid.

24:40.120 --> 24:41.140
We'll be all right.

24:41.140 --> 24:43.023
It'll get easier as it goes along.

24:45.900 --> 24:48.490
These Germans probably weren't alone.

24:48.490 --> 24:49.617
Let's go check it out.

25:19.763 --> 25:22.096
- Why don't we just go around?

25:22.096 --> 25:24.506
- I figured you'd say that.

25:29.790 --> 25:31.380
No, we need to take them out.

25:31.380 --> 25:32.840
Otherwise, they'll be on our heels

25:32.840 --> 25:34.290
all the way to the objective.

25:35.620 --> 25:36.963
Take them by surprise.

25:38.150 --> 25:39.723
On my order, shoot to kill.

25:42.410 --> 25:43.435
Go!

26:23.469 --> 26:25.052
Let's check it out.

26:37.760 --> 26:40.233
Get some news footage
of these dead krauts.

26:45.114 --> 26:46.890
That's the second time I've caught you

26:46.890 --> 26:48.140
not firing at the enemy.

26:48.140 --> 26:49.520
- I did!

26:49.520 --> 26:50.700
- You looked down.

26:50.700 --> 26:52.780
You closed your eyes.

26:52.780 --> 26:56.870
I don't care about your moral
and religious convictions.

26:56.870 --> 26:59.140
God has abandoned us.

26:59.140 --> 27:01.973
When I tell you to shoot
to kill, you do just that!

27:08.360 --> 27:09.893
Looks like ammunition station.

28:04.455 --> 28:05.760
- Would you look at this.

28:05.760 --> 28:08.210
- There's still a lot of ammunitions here.

28:08.210 --> 28:10.030
- Damn krauts, must've been using

28:10.030 --> 28:13.260
as a halfway drop and load.

28:13.260 --> 28:14.370
- Why don't we blow it up?

28:14.370 --> 28:15.280
- What?

28:15.280 --> 28:16.350
- Destroy it.

28:16.350 --> 28:17.870
Otherwise, these bombs could come down

28:17.870 --> 28:20.160
on American heads or ours.

28:20.160 --> 28:21.660
- Good plan.

28:21.660 --> 28:25.620
These Nazis have been
bombing England for months.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.420
They can stand to lose a few, right?

28:36.977 --> 28:38.880
You're smart enough to throw it

28:38.880 --> 28:40.630
after you pull the pin, aren't you?

28:44.010 --> 28:44.883
On three.

28:45.970 --> 28:48.453
One, two, three.

29:05.377 --> 29:06.890
- I missed the best part.

29:06.890 --> 29:08.380
- Don't worry, news boy.

29:08.380 --> 29:11.070
You'll get plenty more opportunities.

29:11.070 --> 29:12.980
- If only we had some marshmallows.

29:12.980 --> 29:13.933
- Ha, real funny.

29:38.054 --> 29:43.054
- I heard a couple of our GIs
got ambushed in this vicinity.

29:44.510 --> 29:46.263
We'll check for more bodies.

29:48.100 --> 29:51.493
Ever since D-Day, our boys'
been spread all across Europe.

30:00.960 --> 30:02.823
- Does this change your opinion any?

30:03.960 --> 30:05.360
Makes you angry, doesn't it?

30:06.580 --> 30:09.203
Maybe kill a few Nazis
just for the hell of it.

30:11.740 --> 30:14.523
Take a real good look and don't forget it.

30:15.750 --> 30:19.450
Our men's bodies have been
splattered everywhere.

30:19.450 --> 30:22.823
Churchill and his English
brigade died just as easily.

30:24.210 --> 30:25.793
Death doesn't discriminate.

30:32.760 --> 30:34.080
Any more?

30:34.080 --> 30:35.668
- I found two.

30:35.668 --> 30:37.251
I think it was two.

31:30.687 --> 31:31.977
- Look at that.

31:31.977 --> 31:32.977
One of ours.

31:35.087 --> 31:37.350
- You think it's booby trap, Sarge?

31:37.350 --> 31:39.350
- Little chance of that.

31:39.350 --> 31:40.920
This was a hit and run mission.

31:40.920 --> 31:43.370
Retaliation for the
fire bombings as Dresden

31:44.760 --> 31:47.730
- It would be a shame to
just leave it lying around.

31:47.730 --> 31:48.563
- Yes, it would.

31:49.512 --> 31:50.720
With this baby on our side,

31:50.720 --> 31:53.020
we could cut a couple
of days off our mission.

31:53.930 --> 31:56.410
- I know a little something about tanks.

31:56.410 --> 31:58.083
Come on, we'll see if it still runs.

32:08.770 --> 32:11.020
- I didn't think we'd
ever this close, Sarge.

32:13.090 --> 32:15.690
- Take command of this tank, Buford.

32:15.690 --> 32:17.033
- I'll see what I can do.

32:18.062 --> 32:19.712
It seems the drive gear is stuck.

32:25.742 --> 32:28.400
It appears some of the wiring has shorted.

32:28.400 --> 32:29.603
I'll have to reroute it.

32:31.870 --> 32:34.260
- Do what you need but hurry.

32:34.260 --> 32:36.400
We got a war to win.

32:36.400 --> 32:39.000
- Are we driving this all the
way to the objective, Sarge?

32:39.000 --> 32:42.610
- As far as we can
without drawing attention.

32:42.610 --> 32:43.560
- I think I got it.

32:50.070 --> 32:51.910
Open the exhaust fan on the bottom panel

32:51.910 --> 32:53.290
so we don't choke to death.

32:53.290 --> 32:54.290
- Got it.

33:01.250 --> 33:03.863
- You got it started but can you drive it?

33:04.790 --> 33:05.623
- Sure.

33:15.960 --> 33:16.970
Which way?

33:16.970 --> 33:19.503
- Due east, 15 kilometers.

33:21.990 --> 33:22.833
- Yes, Sarge.

34:07.730 --> 34:09.389
- What's going on?

34:09.389 --> 34:10.460
- The tank is empty.

34:10.460 --> 34:11.840
We're not going anywhere

34:11.840 --> 34:14.270
till we get some fuel in this crate.

34:14.270 --> 34:15.170
- End of the line.

34:17.460 --> 34:18.493
- Everyone out.

34:24.408 --> 34:27.590
We're not gonna waste too much
time or effort on this tank.

34:27.590 --> 34:32.590
Buford, MacInroy, I want
you to do a quick recon.

34:33.210 --> 34:36.610
Scout the area for any possible fuel dumps

34:36.610 --> 34:38.563
or any out buildings containing fuel.

34:39.454 --> 34:42.371
- Yes, Sarge.

34:46.072 --> 34:47.690
- What do we do?

34:47.690 --> 34:48.523
- Wait.

35:28.692 --> 35:29.937
- It looks deserted.

35:29.937 --> 35:32.120
- And those look like fuel drums.

35:32.120 --> 35:33.923
- Yeah, let's report back.

35:54.790 --> 35:55.740
- What'd you find?

35:55.740 --> 35:57.420
- A potentially deserted out building

35:57.420 --> 35:59.857
with what appears to be
fuel drums out front.

36:00.913 --> 36:03.173
- All right, let's go take a closer look.

36:47.890 --> 36:48.883
Definitely petrol.

36:50.320 --> 36:51.770
Not exactly what we need.

36:51.770 --> 36:53.850
This is for planes.

36:53.850 --> 36:57.200
- Well, it might rip
the guts out of the tank

36:57.200 --> 36:58.743
but she should run off it.

37:58.908 --> 38:00.658
- Over here!

38:02.873 --> 38:05.370
- What do we have here?

38:05.370 --> 38:07.300
A Nazi kraut.

38:07.300 --> 38:09.393
A lousy Nazi kraut.

38:10.270 --> 38:12.900
Well, today isn't your lucky day, kraut.

38:12.900 --> 38:15.210
- He looks like just a kid,
we should take him prisoner.

38:15.210 --> 38:16.460
- To hell with that.

38:16.460 --> 38:18.080
- The Geneva Convention dictates--

38:18.080 --> 38:20.475
- To hell with the Geneva Convention.

38:20.475 --> 38:21.870
- Look, he's scared.

38:21.870 --> 38:23.810
He's probably a deserter.

38:23.810 --> 38:26.870
- Are you a deserter, killer?

38:26.870 --> 38:27.730
- Nein!

38:27.730 --> 38:28.563
Nein!

38:29.470 --> 38:30.393
- Spy?

38:30.393 --> 38:31.226
- Nein!

38:31.226 --> 38:32.530
- We should take him prisoner.

38:32.530 --> 38:35.390
- We don't have time for prisoners.

38:35.390 --> 38:36.740
- His gun hasn't even been fired.

38:36.740 --> 38:37.920
It's not even loaded.

38:37.920 --> 38:41.740
- That doesn't mean he
couldn't stick us with a knife.

38:41.740 --> 38:42.920
Give him his gun back.

38:42.920 --> 38:43.860
- What?

38:43.860 --> 38:45.680
- Nein, nein.

38:45.680 --> 38:47.100
- I gave you an order.

38:47.100 --> 38:48.500
- He's surrendering.

38:48.500 --> 38:49.550
- No, he isn't.

38:49.550 --> 38:52.230
He's about to draw a fire on us.

38:52.230 --> 38:55.713
MacInroy, start filming when I tell you.

38:58.290 --> 39:00.350
- Sarge, this is inhumane.

39:00.350 --> 39:01.933
- Nazis are inhumane.

39:05.880 --> 39:07.410
- This has gone on long enough.

39:07.410 --> 39:08.500
I won't stand for it.

39:08.500 --> 39:09.703
- Then sit down!

39:13.280 --> 39:15.850
Put your gun on me, kraut,
like you mean to kill me.

39:15.850 --> 39:17.180
Do it!

39:17.180 --> 39:18.430
Do it!

39:18.430 --> 39:20.127
Start filming, MacInroy.

39:23.677 --> 39:24.510
Do it!

39:24.510 --> 39:25.343
- Nein!

39:25.343 --> 39:26.676
- Do it!
- Nein!

39:40.710 --> 39:42.423
- He refused to surrender.

39:43.440 --> 39:47.080
Just as we are about to
draw fire so I shot him.

39:47.080 --> 39:48.397
Simple enough.

40:14.620 --> 40:16.930
Let's roll these barrels over to the tank

40:16.930 --> 40:18.023
and get it filled up.

40:19.160 --> 40:22.313
Buford, you park the
tank behind the building.

40:23.150 --> 40:24.740
It's getting late.

40:24.740 --> 40:26.240
We'll stay here for the night.

40:29.990 --> 40:32.080
I'm giving you orders, soldiers!

40:32.080 --> 40:32.913
Listen!

40:50.450 --> 40:52.130
- Where's Buford?

40:52.130 --> 40:55.620
- In the tank, being antisocial.

40:55.620 --> 40:59.000
Writing a letter to his
sweetheart back home.

40:59.000 --> 41:01.160
- You did punch him in the face.

41:01.160 --> 41:03.350
- He disobeyed orders.

41:03.350 --> 41:05.260
- He was only doing what was right.

41:05.260 --> 41:06.950
- What was right?

41:06.950 --> 41:08.523
What was right, really?

41:09.570 --> 41:12.170
I know things about these filthy Germans

41:12.170 --> 41:14.860
that make you wanna kill
every single one of them.

41:14.860 --> 41:15.710
- Like what?

41:15.710 --> 41:17.590
We all know war is a dirty business.

41:17.590 --> 41:19.710
- I've seen photos.

41:19.710 --> 41:21.970
Heard stories what these krauts

41:21.970 --> 41:24.550
are doing to innocent human beings.

41:24.550 --> 41:26.010
- Yeah?

41:26.010 --> 41:28.630
- Unspeakable inhumanities.

41:28.630 --> 41:31.923
Makes you question your faith
in the human race entirely.

41:33.480 --> 41:35.860
Ever heard of the German death camps?

41:35.860 --> 41:37.700
- No, what are they?

41:37.700 --> 41:39.690
- You see, the Germans
are rounding up people

41:39.690 --> 41:42.130
and taken them to slave labor camps,

41:42.130 --> 41:44.490
working them till they die,

41:44.490 --> 41:46.570
butchering them, starving them,

41:46.570 --> 41:48.483
raping them by the thousands.

41:49.720 --> 41:51.980
They make them dig their own graves,

41:51.980 --> 41:55.023
strip them naked then shoot them.

41:56.210 --> 41:58.430
Bringing them in by
the train load everyday

41:58.430 --> 42:00.390
and exterminate them.

42:00.390 --> 42:02.360
- It's horrifying, really?

42:02.360 --> 42:05.150
- So when I killed that stupid kraut,

42:05.150 --> 42:08.163
it barely makes up for what
they're doing right now.

42:09.450 --> 42:12.833
Where's the Geneva Convention
in a German death camp?

42:44.990 --> 42:48.750
- My love, I am learning
everyday that war is hell.

42:48.750 --> 42:51.830
If a place exists, we are
right in the middle of it.

42:51.830 --> 42:54.570
I saw things today that
made me question my faith

42:54.570 --> 42:56.490
and people altogether.

42:56.490 --> 42:58.250
Will this war ever end?

42:58.250 --> 43:00.890
Will fighting between people ever end?

43:00.890 --> 43:03.980
I have slowly learned there
are no winners in a war.

43:03.980 --> 43:06.920
It starts, it ends.

43:06.920 --> 43:09.450
And those who begin and move on,

43:09.450 --> 43:13.490
the innocent people fight it
but leaders watch it unfold.

43:13.490 --> 43:16.060
I can't believe god would let this happen.

43:16.060 --> 43:17.820
He does give us a free will

43:17.820 --> 43:20.760
and I suppose strife factors into that.

43:20.760 --> 43:24.490
I hope to return home the
same person I was when I left.

43:24.490 --> 43:28.070
It makes me wonder when we
marry and have children.

43:28.070 --> 43:31.040
Will they face this
nightmare too called war?

43:31.040 --> 43:33.470
Or will we fight and win
so no other human being

43:33.470 --> 43:35.883
has to stain his hands
with the blood of others?

43:36.750 --> 43:37.990
More later.

43:37.990 --> 43:38.883
Love, Buford.

43:52.474 --> 43:54.891
- We need to call HQ.

44:00.370 --> 44:02.534
Headquarters, this is Leader One.

44:04.522 --> 44:05.410
- Sarge, he's hit!

44:05.410 --> 44:06.550
- Don't worry about him!

44:06.550 --> 44:07.829
Flush those krauts out!

44:56.950 --> 44:58.890
- Buford did right by MacInroy.

44:58.890 --> 45:01.850
There's not enough left for
these krauts to fill a boot.

45:01.850 --> 45:02.683
- Yeah.

45:05.630 --> 45:08.502
- You just hold on, you're gonna be okay.

45:08.502 --> 45:10.130
- The camera, the footage.

45:10.130 --> 45:11.594
Take care of it!

45:11.594 --> 45:12.764
- We will, MacInroy.

45:12.764 --> 45:14.389
We'll make sure the whole world sees it.

45:14.389 --> 45:15.679
- I can't see.

45:15.679 --> 45:17.262
It's cold and dark.

45:18.972 --> 45:20.473
I can't wait.

45:20.473 --> 45:21.698
- Reach for the light.

45:21.698 --> 45:22.950
Reach for it.

45:22.950 --> 45:24.323
- Should I go?

45:24.323 --> 45:26.220
I can't leave you guys.

45:26.220 --> 45:28.353
You guys need me.

45:30.917 --> 45:32.667
I can't wait, father.

45:41.060 --> 45:41.893
- Is he gone?

45:43.166 --> 45:44.116
- Of course, he is.

45:44.983 --> 45:46.940
The bullet pierced his heart.

45:46.940 --> 45:48.740
He held out longer than most.

45:48.740 --> 45:51.054
- What was he talking about?

45:51.054 --> 45:52.610
- He wants the world to see his footage.

45:52.610 --> 45:53.690
- No, before that.

45:53.690 --> 45:55.320
About the light.

45:55.320 --> 45:57.780
- Ramblings of a dying man.

45:57.780 --> 45:59.180
They all go out differently.

46:00.110 --> 46:03.193
- He saw his father,
passed him to eternity.

46:04.490 --> 46:09.350
Sometimes, love ones wait for
you and help you cross over.

46:10.870 --> 46:13.473
- I guess when I go
out, I'll be on my own.

46:15.870 --> 46:19.033
He deserves a decent
burial wherever he went.

46:32.340 --> 46:33.640
- Should we say something?

46:35.100 --> 46:37.010
- If we stop to give a moment of silence

46:37.010 --> 46:38.623
to every fallen soldier,

46:39.525 --> 46:41.575
the Germans would've won the war already.

46:43.700 --> 46:44.693
- Wyoming is right.

46:45.620 --> 46:47.473
He deserves a moment of silence.

46:53.488 --> 46:56.180
May you find peace, brother.

46:56.180 --> 46:58.290
In the arms of our lord and in heaven.

47:40.323 --> 47:43.749
You make me nervous looking
over my shoulder all the time.

47:43.749 --> 47:45.430
- I'm watching how you drive thing

47:45.430 --> 47:47.550
in case you're not around.

47:47.550 --> 47:48.623
And we have to.

47:49.587 --> 47:51.740
- I'm not driving this thing.

47:51.740 --> 47:53.400
- You will if I order you to.

47:53.400 --> 47:54.723
- Yes, Sarge.

48:01.810 --> 48:02.770
- Everyone out!

48:02.770 --> 48:03.853
Get your things!

48:08.150 --> 48:10.890
We got a kraut land mine
and the tracks are busted.

48:10.890 --> 48:12.393
There's no way we can fix it.

48:14.090 --> 48:15.940
- Guess it's back to boots and sweat.

48:19.500 --> 48:20.683
- Let's call HQ.

48:26.980 --> 48:29.000
Base Command, this is Leader One.

48:29.000 --> 48:30.780
- This is Base Command.

48:30.780 --> 48:32.750
Please report your progress.

48:32.750 --> 48:36.227
We commandeered an American
tank but the tracks blew out.

48:37.550 --> 48:39.653
We're proceeding to the directive on foot.

48:40.530 --> 48:42.210
- Understood.

48:42.210 --> 48:44.510
Proceed with caution.

48:44.510 --> 48:45.343
- Yes, sir.

48:45.343 --> 48:46.176
Over and out.

48:49.480 --> 48:50.620
All right, girls.

48:50.620 --> 48:51.497
Let's head out.

49:33.873 --> 49:35.250
Hold on, krauts!

49:35.250 --> 49:36.083
Three o'clock!

49:42.540 --> 49:44.610
- Kill one, three more show up.

49:44.610 --> 49:47.140
- They're nothing better than cockroaches.

49:47.140 --> 49:48.793
- Look Sarge, there's the dam.

49:53.710 --> 49:55.010
- Come on, let's move out.

52:26.043 --> 52:28.028
- I'm sure they
did a number on this place.

52:28.028 --> 52:29.830
- I wish I would've been here.

52:29.830 --> 52:31.210
Nothing would've made me happier

52:31.210 --> 52:33.610
than seeing a couple
hundred krauts washed away.

52:35.090 --> 52:36.690
- The base can't be too far off.

52:37.650 --> 52:39.773
- Intel puts it about a mile that way.

53:32.016 --> 53:33.620
There it is.

53:33.620 --> 53:35.250
- What a mess.

53:35.250 --> 53:37.750
- Well, all we gotta do now
is grab the code and get out.

53:37.750 --> 53:38.870
Mission accomplished.

53:38.870 --> 53:40.720
- You think it's gonna be that easy?

53:40.720 --> 53:42.150
- Well, yeah.

53:42.150 --> 53:44.330
- We may have to get our hands dirty.

53:44.330 --> 53:45.163
- Meaning what?

53:46.404 --> 53:49.190
- That strongbox could be
anywhere in that building.

53:49.190 --> 53:51.220
Buried under eternal rubble.

53:51.220 --> 53:53.500
- Or washed away into
the town with the flood.

53:53.500 --> 53:55.400
- Let's try to remain positive.

53:55.400 --> 53:56.950
- It's just a thought.

54:20.490 --> 54:22.850
This place could use a housekeeper.

54:22.850 --> 54:24.350
- Funny.

54:24.350 --> 54:28.690
All right, Buford, you
take the first floor.

54:28.690 --> 54:31.170
Wyoming, you take the basement.

54:31.170 --> 54:33.350
I'll take the second floor.

54:33.350 --> 54:35.710
We're looking for a small metal container.

54:35.710 --> 54:38.310
No bigger than ammunitions box.

54:38.310 --> 54:39.210
- Got it.

54:39.210 --> 54:43.490
- Oh, watch out for mines and booby traps.

54:43.490 --> 54:44.670
- Thanks, Sarge.

54:44.670 --> 54:45.503
Will do.

55:47.942 --> 55:48.775
- It's gonna be like finding

55:48.775 --> 55:50.692
a needle in a haystack.

58:35.643 --> 58:36.907
- Nothing.

58:36.907 --> 58:40.370
But in this light, you could
trip over a platoon and see it.

58:40.370 --> 58:41.750
- We should wait until morning

58:41.750 --> 58:42.840
and make more thorough search.

58:42.840 --> 58:44.160
We can see better.

58:44.160 --> 58:45.760
- Who put you in charge?

58:45.760 --> 58:47.740
- I was stating the facts.

58:47.740 --> 58:50.133
- Yeah, but I give the orders around here.

58:51.560 --> 58:53.130
I say we wait until morning.

58:53.130 --> 58:55.960
We'll conduct a more extensive search.

58:55.960 --> 58:56.950
- I just said that.

58:56.950 --> 58:59.610
- Yeah, but I give the orders around here.

58:59.610 --> 59:01.660
Unless you got a shrapnel
wound to your head

59:01.660 --> 59:03.750
and your memory's getting foggy.

59:03.750 --> 59:04.583
- No, Sarge.

59:05.750 --> 59:07.450
- Let's hunker down for the night.

59:09.470 --> 59:10.793
Keep your eyes open.

59:11.650 --> 59:14.683
There maybe more Germans
out there slithering around.

59:15.930 --> 59:17.030
- Yes, Sarge.

59:48.718 --> 59:49.551
- Sarge.

59:51.040 --> 59:53.040
- What is it, Wyoming?

59:53.040 --> 59:54.770
Don't you ever shut up?

59:54.770 --> 59:56.070
- It's too early to sleep.

59:58.530 --> 01:00:01.330
- Why don't you write
home to your girlfriend

01:00:01.330 --> 01:00:03.143
like Buford does every night.

01:00:04.030 --> 01:00:05.300
- I don't have a girl.

01:00:05.300 --> 01:00:07.043
- Why doesn't that surprise me?

01:00:08.290 --> 01:00:11.020
- When I got drafted, I knew
I didn't want to make a woman

01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:13.500
wait for me for at least a year.

01:00:13.500 --> 01:00:14.333
It's not fair.

01:00:15.690 --> 01:00:18.800
- Is that the best excuse you've got?

01:00:18.800 --> 01:00:19.690
- It's not fair.

01:00:19.690 --> 01:00:22.020
Do you think Buford's
girl will wait for him?

01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:25.363
- She's probably back bawling
Jody till he gets back home.

01:00:26.503 --> 01:00:27.650
- Do you really think so?

01:00:27.650 --> 01:00:29.280
He'd be awfully upset.

01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:32.350
- Ah, I'm just pulling your leg, kid.

01:00:32.350 --> 01:00:34.770
You take everything too seriously.

01:00:34.770 --> 01:00:36.540
- War is a serious business.

01:00:36.540 --> 01:00:38.993
I'm not afraid to admit
it, I'm afraid everyday.

01:00:41.260 --> 01:00:42.923
- Everybody's afraid, kid.

01:00:43.930 --> 01:00:45.273
You needn't feel special.

01:00:47.890 --> 01:00:49.290
- Even you?

01:00:49.290 --> 01:00:50.780
- Yeah.

01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.640
- Really?

01:00:51.640 --> 01:00:53.793
- I'm afraid the war'll end today.

01:00:55.438 --> 01:00:59.030
Then I have to decide what
to do the rest of my life.

01:00:59.030 --> 01:01:00.030
- Whatever you want.

01:01:01.570 --> 01:01:03.520
- It's that easy, huh?

01:01:03.520 --> 01:01:04.353
- Well, yeah.

01:01:05.250 --> 01:01:07.733
- Well, here in this hell torn place,

01:01:09.550 --> 01:01:11.470
killing is okay.

01:01:11.470 --> 01:01:12.323
It's legal.

01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.593
Back home, it's a crime.

01:01:17.480 --> 01:01:19.177
- Well, once we get back home,
you won't need to kill that.

01:01:19.177 --> 01:01:21.023
I mean we would've been defeated.

01:01:22.120 --> 01:01:24.953
- There's enemies everywhere
you turn in this world.

01:01:25.970 --> 01:01:28.223
Even on American soil.

01:01:29.750 --> 01:01:32.253
Don't forget the Pacific battle going on.

01:01:33.690 --> 01:01:35.743
Japs are as bad as Germans.

01:01:36.590 --> 01:01:41.590
We wiped their noses clean,
took out all their battleships.

01:01:41.630 --> 01:01:44.863
Or they're air defenses
are in taters as well.

01:01:46.270 --> 01:01:49.120
What I wouldn't give to
be in the Marshall Islands

01:01:49.120 --> 01:01:51.460
killing a few Japs?

01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.240
- You can't go around
your whole life hating.

01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:56.093
- This is the rest of our life.

01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.150
Maybe all the wayward
Christian pray for me.

01:02:00.150 --> 01:02:00.993
- Pray for what?

01:02:01.870 --> 01:02:03.643
- Pray that the war keeps going.

01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:06.673
Just keeps going.

01:02:24.190 --> 01:02:26.050
- To my forever girl,

01:02:26.050 --> 01:02:29.000
finding time to write
gets harder and harder.

01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.880
But I make it a point to
send a letter everyday.

01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:33.530
I hope you're getting them.

01:02:33.530 --> 01:02:35.110
I know you've written back but the mail

01:02:35.110 --> 01:02:37.170
is so slow getting to us due to the fact

01:02:37.170 --> 01:02:39.210
we constantly move around.

01:02:39.210 --> 01:02:41.610
I'm betting there'll be a
dozen letters waiting for me

01:02:41.610 --> 01:02:43.160
when we get back to our main barrack

01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:45.930
once this crazy mission is over.

01:02:45.930 --> 01:02:49.600
I'm convinced our sergeant is
crazy, I mean really crazy.

01:02:49.600 --> 01:02:52.620
He likes all these war business
and I get the impression

01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:54.780
he never wants it to end.

01:02:54.780 --> 01:02:55.930
If you go the movie house,

01:02:55.930 --> 01:02:58.200
look for me in some of the newsreels.

01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:00.870
We had a combat photographer
with us and some of his footage

01:03:00.870 --> 01:03:02.320
may get back home.

01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:05.210
Imagine seeing me on a giant screen.

01:03:05.210 --> 01:03:06.820
Pretty amazing.

01:03:06.820 --> 01:03:08.610
Well, we have a long day tomorrow.

01:03:08.610 --> 01:03:09.940
Lights out.

01:03:09.940 --> 01:03:11.983
All my love, Buford.

01:03:53.950 --> 01:03:55.500
- Now, logic would have it

01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:58.083
they would've kept the
strong box in a office.

01:03:59.260 --> 01:04:02.213
Down at the far end appears to be one.

01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:06.660
Flood woulda washed it out down there.

01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:11.181
So let's make a concentrated
effort to scour the floor.

01:04:11.181 --> 01:04:12.264
- Yes, Sarge.

01:05:27.433 --> 01:05:29.180
- Is that it?

01:05:29.180 --> 01:05:30.867
- There's only way to find out.

01:05:35.231 --> 01:05:36.148
It's stuck!

01:05:37.490 --> 01:05:38.340
Stand back.

01:05:55.510 --> 01:05:56.920
- It's German code, all right.

01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:58.600
- This is what we came for.

01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:00.350
- Well, now we can get out of here.

01:06:01.640 --> 01:06:04.143
- First we gotta bury this box back up.

01:06:26.596 --> 01:06:27.441
- He's finished!

01:06:27.441 --> 01:06:28.691
Let's move out!

01:06:34.284 --> 01:06:35.378
Go!

01:06:36.269 --> 01:06:37.436
- Go!

01:06:50.184 --> 01:06:53.233
- We're sitting duck if they
cut us off from the rear.

01:06:55.478 --> 01:06:58.395
- Let's get through woods in there!

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.150
- This oughta cool their heels.

01:07:29.210 --> 01:07:32.203
- Sarge, Sarge, Sarge.

01:07:33.180 --> 01:07:35.280
- Guess this war is over for me after all.
