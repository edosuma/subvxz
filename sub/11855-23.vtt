WEBVTT

00:21.208 --> 00:24.542
Turn that music down
for God's sakes!

00:28.667 --> 00:30.166
(Simone)
'I'm hungry.'

00:31.041 --> 00:32.333
'I need you to go to the store.'

00:33.959 --> 00:34.875
Now!

00:49.041 --> 00:50.959
You mind me!

00:51.041 --> 00:52.750
I did a bad thing, Mother.

00:53.917 --> 00:55.333
What did you do?

00:55.417 --> 00:57.041
I took out their eyes.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.583
Hey.

02:16.667 --> 02:19.083
Oh, morning.
The scene's out back.

02:20.458 --> 02:23.792
Lil, been meaning
to talk to you..

02:23.875 --> 02:25.083
...about Chris.

02:26.417 --> 02:28.208
Yeah?
What about?

02:30.166 --> 02:32.000
Uh, you were right.

02:32.083 --> 02:34.500
I, uh, fell for an act.

02:35.875 --> 02:37.291
Well, you're not
the first.

02:37.375 --> 02:38.917
Yeah, but, uh..

02:41.125 --> 02:43.250
...I should have
listened to you.

02:44.291 --> 02:46.208
But anyway..

02:46.291 --> 02:47.583
...I'm sorry.

02:49.083 --> 02:51.417
Uh, I'm sorry
that, uh..

02:53.375 --> 02:54.917
...it came between us.

02:56.500 --> 02:58.333
Detectives.

02:58.417 --> 03:00.291
Ha, what are you
working with, Lenny?

03:00.375 --> 03:02.417
Third week in Homicide,
I get this mess.

03:03.458 --> 03:04.834
Now, what's with
the block party?

03:04.917 --> 03:06.667
[sighs]
Some moron
gets it in his head

03:06.750 --> 03:08.291
to buy this piece of crap.

03:08.375 --> 03:09.834
Sends an inspector
to check it out.

03:09.917 --> 03:11.542
Digs up a bunch of skulls.

03:11.625 --> 03:13.458
- How many?
- Nine.

03:13.542 --> 03:14.875
(Detective Desalle)
'CSU says some are recent'

03:14.959 --> 03:16.667
'others have
been there for years.'

03:16.750 --> 03:18.750
'Found 'em positioned
like this.'

03:18.834 --> 03:21.750
Lined up.
Facing upwards.

03:21.834 --> 03:22.959
Attic of the house.

03:23.041 --> 03:24.959
Owner was killed
up there in 1972.

03:25.041 --> 03:26.583
Single gunshot to the chest.

03:26.667 --> 03:28.083
They find the doer?

03:28.166 --> 03:30.250
Robbery-rape is all they got.

03:30.333 --> 03:31.792
Scotty, look at this.

03:34.583 --> 03:36.250
Black marbles
in all their eyes.

03:42.125 --> 03:43.667
Want to clue me in?

03:43.750 --> 03:46.125
[sighs]
Serial killer we interviewed
a few months back.

03:47.458 --> 03:49.667
Black marbles like these
were at his place.

03:51.125 --> 03:53.041
That's the freak
who walked, right?

03:53.125 --> 03:55.458
Hunted down his victims?

03:55.542 --> 03:57.041
He made them run..

03:57.125 --> 03:58.959
...till they couldn't anymore.

04:06.000 --> 04:08.709
He decapitated
nine women.

04:08.792 --> 04:11.250
Never gave up
where he put the
heads.

04:11.333 --> 04:13.417
Looks like we might
have found 'em.

04:13.500 --> 04:15.166
And who was
the previous
owner?

04:15.250 --> 04:16.917
Simone Marks. 33.

04:17.000 --> 04:18.583
Lived here
with her 12-year-old son.

04:18.667 --> 04:20.041
Named George.

04:21.291 --> 04:22.792
Yeah. That's right.

04:30.125 --> 04:32.333
Looks like our serial
killer's
come back home.

05:23.542 --> 05:26.125
Now we know what George
did with their heads..

05:26.208 --> 05:29.750
...buried 'em in his childhood
backyard all facing the attic

05:29.834 --> 05:31.250
where his mom was murdered.

05:31.333 --> 05:34.917
And the deer eyes? He put
them in their eye sockets?

05:35.000 --> 05:38.542
Well, maybe he wanted those
dead women to see something.

05:38.625 --> 05:41.458
- Like?
- Like his first kill?

05:42.375 --> 05:43.959
His own mother?

05:44.041 --> 05:46.333
Well, rape was
never his MO,
Lil.

05:46.417 --> 05:48.792
Got to be a reason he's
lining up the heads like that.

05:49.917 --> 05:51.583
Scotty, we hear anything
from Fugitives yet

05:51.667 --> 05:52.875
on George's whereabouts?

05:52.959 --> 05:54.792
Well, Sherman
had a bead on
him..

05:54.875 --> 05:56.166
...till three weeks ago.

05:56.250 --> 05:58.542
Then George drops off
the face of the Earth.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.792
Alright, what do we know
about George's mother's murder?

06:00.875 --> 06:03.917
Robbery-rape gone south.
Signs of forced entry.

06:04.000 --> 06:07.000
Mom was found stripped,
semen recovered at the scene.

06:07.083 --> 06:08.750
Any leads
back in '72 on the doer?

06:08.834 --> 06:12.375
Well, weapon that killed
Simone
was a Colt .22 automatic.

06:12.458 --> 06:14.417
Woodsman series.

06:14.500 --> 06:16.625
- Never recovered.
- What else?

06:16.709 --> 06:20.125
Well, there's a set of prints
off a jimmied window. No hits.

06:20.208 --> 06:22.875
Now, the doer's had 33 years
to make it into the system.

06:22.959 --> 06:24.625
- Run 'em again.
- Yeah.

06:24.709 --> 06:27.041
We think workin' this job will
flush your boy out?

06:27.125 --> 06:28.458
Could, yeah.

06:28.542 --> 06:31.250
Hey, you know, George couldn't
have killed his own mother.

06:31.333 --> 06:32.333
Why not?

06:32.417 --> 06:34.041
Well, he wasn't
in the house that night.

06:34.125 --> 06:36.291
DHS removed him
hours earlier.

06:36.375 --> 06:39.291
Put him in a group home
at mom's request.

06:39.375 --> 06:40.750
His mother put him away?

06:42.709 --> 06:44.917
Told the authorities
she was scared of her own son.

06:49.542 --> 06:51.667
(man #1)
'Yeah, I took him out of
here.'

06:51.750 --> 06:53.458
'Kid was a real whack job.'

06:57.542 --> 06:59.875
Sat in front of
the window
there.

06:59.959 --> 07:01.709
Tiddling
with
his
flashlight.

07:05.625 --> 07:08.083
Well, his mother said
she was afraid of him. Why?

07:08.166 --> 07:10.959
Kid was a punk. Mom couldn't
control him anymore.

07:11.041 --> 07:13.000
So you carted him
off
to the group home?

07:13.083 --> 07:14.166
Yeah.

07:14.250 --> 07:16.542
Let him loose
with the other animals.

07:16.625 --> 07:18.542
This was his bedroom.

07:18.625 --> 07:20.792
Mom kept him
locked up in here.

07:20.875 --> 07:22.250
What do you mean, locked up?

07:23.417 --> 07:25.375
Deadbolts on the door.

07:25.458 --> 07:27.333
Don't think
she let him out much.

07:27.417 --> 07:29.709
What else are you gonna
do with a kid like that?

07:29.792 --> 07:31.667
(man #1)
'He was a weirdo, alright.'

07:31.750 --> 07:33.875
But if you ask me..

07:33.959 --> 07:35.125
...so was Mom.

07:37.625 --> 07:39.291
I keep him in here..

07:39.375 --> 07:41.542
...so he won't
run out at nights.

07:48.792 --> 07:50.208
Time to go, George.

07:57.166 --> 08:00.041
Upsy Daisy!
You heard your mom!

08:01.959 --> 08:04.333
You need me to go
to the store, Mother.

08:04.417 --> 08:06.208
Mind me.

08:06.291 --> 08:09.041
Are you sending me away because
of what I did to their eyes?

08:09.125 --> 08:11.917
Stop talking, George.

08:31.166 --> 08:32.625
You did this.

08:34.000 --> 08:36.542
You're a bad, bad boy.

08:36.625 --> 08:38.458
But I did it to help you.

08:38.542 --> 08:40.417
You are the darkness.

08:40.500 --> 08:42.208
You always will be.

08:47.583 --> 08:49.750
Apple didn't fall far
from the tree.

08:49.834 --> 08:51.375
You know what I mean?

08:52.750 --> 08:55.750
What was with the light
coming from that house?

08:55.834 --> 08:58.083
Got me. Looked like
some kind of signal.

08:58.166 --> 09:00.583
Hey, Nick.
Check this out.

09:00.667 --> 09:02.375
(Nick)
'What have you got?'

09:05.041 --> 09:06.458
Same kind
of knife
marks.

09:06.542 --> 09:07.875
Top and bottom
of the stairs.

09:07.959 --> 09:09.333
What are they?

09:09.417 --> 09:12.959
I got 13 down here.
How many have you got?

09:13.041 --> 09:15.166
13. So what?

09:15.250 --> 09:16.709
13 steps.

09:23.208 --> 09:26.250
You were George's
neighbor back in
'72?

09:26.333 --> 09:28.959
My bedroom was right there.
Across from his.

09:30.083 --> 09:31.333
'The haunted house.'

09:31.417 --> 09:33.166
- That's what we called it.
- Why?

09:33.250 --> 09:34.959
Night after night,
music would be blaring

09:35.041 --> 09:36.250
out of the attic.

09:36.333 --> 09:38.959
Real sappy songs,
over and over.

09:39.041 --> 09:40.792
But you and George
were friends?

09:40.875 --> 09:42.208
Wouldn't call it that.

09:42.291 --> 09:45.333
We'd just fool around
with our flashlights at night.

09:45.417 --> 09:47.208
Morse code.

09:47.291 --> 09:48.709
Wh-what kind of Morse code?

09:48.792 --> 09:52.000
"Hi, bye, SOS,"
dumb stuff like that.

09:52.083 --> 09:54.542
My folks would have
killed me if they found out.

09:54.625 --> 09:57.625
No one wanted their kids
playing with George.

09:57.709 --> 09:59.333
And you were doing
this Morse code
thing

09:59.417 --> 10:01.333
night George's
mother was
killed?

10:01.417 --> 10:03.333
George never
coded me back..

10:03.417 --> 10:06.125
...so, I went over
to see why.

10:31.000 --> 10:33.458
(man #2)
'Shut-ins like her
always have bank stash'

10:33.542 --> 10:34.709
under their mattresses.

10:34.792 --> 10:35.917
(man #3)
You sure she's alone, man?

10:36.000 --> 10:37.000
(man #2)
'Yeah, I'm sure.'

10:57.750 --> 10:59.583
It was like she was lookin'
right through me.

11:01.500 --> 11:02.709
Then what?

11:02.792 --> 11:04.709
(Evan)
Then the guys
started in on a window..

11:04.792 --> 11:06.625
...with a crowbar.

11:06.709 --> 11:08.125
I ran back home.

11:10.500 --> 11:12.250
Ah, thanks for
coming
out here, Evan.

11:14.458 --> 11:16.667
(Lilly)
You know, Jeffries said
Simone had those knife marks

11:16.750 --> 11:19.125
on all her
stairways, right?

11:19.208 --> 11:22.000
13 marks
and 13 steps.

11:22.083 --> 11:23.250
(Scotty)
'Yeah.'

11:23.333 --> 11:25.458
And George said he made
those marks to help her.

11:26.250 --> 11:27.333
Okay. So what?

11:27.417 --> 11:29.583
Simone looked
past Evan because..

11:29.667 --> 11:31.083
...she couldn't see him.

11:33.667 --> 11:35.125
George's mother was blind.

11:40.000 --> 11:42.000
(Lilly)
That's why George's fixation
with his victims' eyes.

11:42.083 --> 11:43.667
His mother was blind.

11:43.750 --> 11:45.125
(Detective Desalle)
'The knife marks
in the wall were'

11:45.208 --> 11:46.750
a kind of crude
Braille for her.

11:46.834 --> 11:48.583
And no one else knew
about her blindness?

11:48.667 --> 11:50.000
She was a shut-in.

11:50.083 --> 11:52.667
Barely came in contact
with the outside world.

11:52.750 --> 11:54.250
Got a hit
on those window prints.

11:54.333 --> 11:55.291
(Lilly)
'Yeah?'

11:55.375 --> 11:56.667
Jacob Leonardo.

11:56.750 --> 11:58.375
He's locked up
in Allenwood Federal Pen.

11:58.458 --> 12:00.250
We're taking your ride,
mine's in the shop.

12:00.333 --> 12:01.709
Road trip. Great.

12:01.792 --> 12:03.792
This Leonardo
doing time for burglary?

12:03.875 --> 12:07.041
Mmm. Rape. Has a rap sheet
as long as my arm.

12:07.125 --> 12:10.041
Kids, grandmas,
all 31 flavors in between.

12:10.125 --> 12:11.959
Uses his belt
to gag his victims.

12:13.041 --> 12:14.625
A real Romeo, this guy.

12:14.709 --> 12:16.959
Better be getting back
some of that love in lockup.

12:22.375 --> 12:24.166
Wonder what kind
of prison justice
you'll get

12:24.250 --> 12:26.834
when they hear you raped
and killed a blind lady.

12:26.917 --> 12:28.458
What are you talking about?

12:28.542 --> 12:30.083
1972 job.

12:30.166 --> 12:31.792
I don't know
nothing about
it.

12:31.875 --> 12:35.166
No? 'Cause we lifted
your prints from her window.

12:35.250 --> 12:39.000
Prints? So what?
Maybe I worked at the house.

12:39.083 --> 12:40.667
Plus, we got
the rapist's semen

12:40.750 --> 12:43.542
and we're taking hair and
blood
samples from you today.

12:43.625 --> 12:44.959
Says who?

12:45.041 --> 12:46.375
My warrant.

12:46.458 --> 12:48.583
(Nick)
'And with
a murder conviction..'

12:48.667 --> 12:50.875
...you're stuck
in this craphole for life.

12:53.083 --> 12:55.125
I didn't kill the
girl.
He did.

12:55.208 --> 12:56.709
- Who?
- Guy who set it up.

12:56.792 --> 12:57.792
What guy?

12:57.875 --> 13:00.792
Some lowlife
that I met at the
track.

13:00.875 --> 13:03.667
We was on a losing streak,
and he says he knows a way

13:03.750 --> 13:06.333
to make off with
some bitch's life
savings.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.583
And you just followed along.

13:08.667 --> 13:09.625
Look, man..

13:10.959 --> 13:13.417
...my thing is rape.

13:13.500 --> 13:15.375
Figured I'd cop a feel..

13:15.458 --> 13:16.750
...some change.

13:17.959 --> 13:19.083
I didn't do murder.

13:23.542 --> 13:24.458
There's nothing here, man.

13:24.542 --> 13:26.208
Be quiet,
or she'll hear you.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.250
Hot damn.

13:50.333 --> 13:51.834
[gasping]
Who's there?

13:51.917 --> 13:53.667
You idiot!
What are you doing?

13:59.208 --> 14:01.583
She's blind
like Stevie Wonder.

14:02.834 --> 14:04.166
- Stop her.
- Whoa-whoa-whoa.

14:07.333 --> 14:09.959
- This wasn't the plan.
- Forget the plan.

14:10.041 --> 14:12.125
No way! I'm not going
to be a part of this!

14:12.208 --> 14:14.291
Then leave.

14:14.375 --> 14:16.583
It's just me and you,
Helen Keller.

14:16.667 --> 14:19.250
I know your voice.
I know who you are.

14:19.333 --> 14:21.041
You're the one
who took George away.

14:23.709 --> 14:25.083
We got to kill her now.

14:25.166 --> 14:27.542
- Might as well rape her
first.
- Huh!

14:28.667 --> 14:30.709
I mean it. Get out.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.625
I bailed.

14:37.709 --> 14:41.125
It was him,
her, the
gun.

14:41.208 --> 14:43.250
That was the last I saw.

14:43.333 --> 14:45.208
Jerk from DHS.

14:45.291 --> 14:47.125
Gets the lay of the land
earlier that night.

14:47.208 --> 14:48.291
Lee.

14:48.375 --> 14:49.583
'The point is..'

14:49.667 --> 14:52.333
...it wasn't me
who killed the girl.

14:52.417 --> 14:54.500
What kind of weapon
did Lee have?

14:54.583 --> 14:56.125
Sweet piece.

14:56.208 --> 14:57.917
Colt automatic .22.

14:59.291 --> 15:00.709
Woodsman series.

15:07.583 --> 15:09.083
Well, you owned
the same kind of gun

15:09.166 --> 15:11.208
that killed
Simone Marks, Lee.

15:11.291 --> 15:13.792
(Lee)
'You're buying
that con's story?'

15:13.875 --> 15:15.458
You're the worst
kind of scum.

15:15.542 --> 15:17.583
Come into people's homes
as the..

15:17.667 --> 15:19.500
...do-gooding
social worker

15:19.583 --> 15:21.875
but on the side,
you're casing the joint.

15:24.291 --> 15:26.333
Did something go wrong
with your robbery that night?

15:27.333 --> 15:28.709
Later, at Simone's?

15:28.792 --> 15:29.875
Like what?

15:29.959 --> 15:32.583
Like she knew you.
Your voice.

15:32.667 --> 15:34.083
So, you had to kill her.

15:37.750 --> 15:40.166
I didn't.
Swear it.

15:40.250 --> 15:41.417
No?

15:42.917 --> 15:44.500
Then what'd you
do at that house

15:44.583 --> 15:47.041
when it was
just you and her?

15:48.583 --> 15:49.917
That's the thing.

15:51.417 --> 15:52.709
It wasn't
just me and her.

15:53.834 --> 15:57.000
I ain't gonna hurt you.
Understand, lady?

15:57.083 --> 15:58.375
What do you want
with me?

15:58.458 --> 16:00.041
No one's gotta
know about
this.

16:00.125 --> 16:01.375
What are you
gonna do?

16:01.458 --> 16:03.917
Dirty acts?
Is that why you're here?

16:04.000 --> 16:06.041
Hey! I'm leaving, okay?

16:06.125 --> 16:08.834
To do dirty,
<i>filthy acts?</i>

16:08.917 --> 16:11.208
<i>Put your disgusting</i>
<i>thing inside me?</i>

16:11.291 --> 16:13.375
- Keep your voice down.
<i>Making another monster?</i>

16:13.458 --> 16:15.208
<i>Another one like him?</i>

16:25.250 --> 16:26.583
The darkness.

16:30.458 --> 16:32.041
It always comes back.

16:48.000 --> 16:49.875
I left my gun there.
Hightailed out.

16:49.959 --> 16:52.291
Are you sure
that

16:52.375 --> 16:53.875
coming from the attic?

16:53.959 --> 16:55.959
You kidding?
Scared the hell out of me.

16:59.959 --> 17:02.417
"The darkness
always comes back."

17:02.500 --> 17:04.583
She was talking about George.

17:04.667 --> 17:06.083
He was in the house.

17:11.834 --> 17:13.250
According to DHS
that group home was a zoo.

17:13.333 --> 17:14.917
Security was next to nil.

17:15.000 --> 17:16.583
Yeah, kids ran away
all the time.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.083
So, George
could have,
too.

17:18.166 --> 17:20.542
So, it's just
him and Mom in the house

17:20.625 --> 17:21.875
and the gun that killed her.

17:21.959 --> 17:24.917
Alright, so he scares
Lee away, and then what?

17:25.000 --> 17:26.583
He shoots his own mother?

17:26.667 --> 17:28.166
(Scotty)
'Mom sent him away.'

17:28.250 --> 17:30.583
Maybe, he was looking
to settle the score.

17:30.667 --> 17:32.083
(Will)
'Looked into
the buyer of the house'

17:32.166 --> 17:34.959
who ordered the inspection.
Guy doesn't exist.

17:35.041 --> 17:36.667
Well, someone signed
the escrow papers.

17:36.750 --> 17:39.041
Someone using an alias.

17:39.125 --> 17:41.583
Who wanted us
to find those skulls.

17:43.166 --> 17:44.333
George.

17:45.750 --> 17:47.333
He set this
whole thing in motion.

17:47.417 --> 17:49.917
Rush, phone for you.
Benton Smith.

17:51.375 --> 17:52.750
That's the name..

17:52.834 --> 17:53.959
...of the buyer.

17:59.375 --> 18:01.125
(John)
'Nick.'

18:14.166 --> 18:15.500
Hi, George.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.709
(George)
'My congratulations to
Will.'

18:17.792 --> 18:21.583
invigorated
that escrow office.'

18:22.458 --> 18:24.125
So, you're in Philadelphia.

18:25.834 --> 18:29.625
I've been following
your work these last few days.

18:29.709 --> 18:32.375
And I see you've followed mine.

18:32.458 --> 18:35.500
Oh, we found
your deer eyes, yeah.

18:35.583 --> 18:38.417
(George on phone)
'Vicious little brute,
that Bambi.'

18:38.500 --> 18:41.166
Do you know what Scottish
researchers have discovered

18:41.250 --> 18:43.000
about our friend, the deer?

18:44.709 --> 18:46.166
Why don't you tell me?

18:46.250 --> 18:49.709
On the mineral-deficient
Island Of Rum..

18:49.792 --> 18:51.959
...deer attack young birds.

18:53.041 --> 18:55.542
'Nestlings.
Decapitate the chicks.'

18:55.625 --> 18:57.458
<i>heads!'</i>

18:58.875 --> 19:00.166
Imagine that.

19:01.625 --> 19:03.041
So, you're the deer?

19:04.166 --> 19:05.875
I thought you were the hunter.

19:07.208 --> 19:09.041
I am both.

19:10.125 --> 19:11.375
Enough with the games, George.

19:11.458 --> 19:13.458
You wanna talk, talk.
If not, I'm hanging up.

19:14.959 --> 19:16.375
Ask your question.

19:19.750 --> 19:22.125
Why did you go back to your
mother's house that night?

19:24.417 --> 19:25.917
To kill her.

19:27.417 --> 19:29.583
But perhaps..

19:29.667 --> 19:31.500
...another beat me to it.

19:32.208 --> 19:33.417
What do you mean?

19:33.500 --> 19:36.583
I wasn't the only one
who went back..

19:36.667 --> 19:38.959
...to that house.

19:50.208 --> 19:51.083
George?

20:07.250 --> 20:08.333
George?

20:10.083 --> 20:11.750
Why'd you send me away, Mother?

20:11.834 --> 20:13.750
You know why.

20:13.834 --> 20:17.250
I didn't make you blind.
How could I?

20:17.333 --> 20:18.583
You..

20:18.667 --> 20:20.083
...are..

20:20.166 --> 20:22.125
<i>...darkness!</i>

20:22.208 --> 20:24.709
<i>did this to me!</i>
<i>know it!</i>

20:38.875 --> 20:40.208
Get out of my house.

21:02.542 --> 21:04.125
No. No.

21:04.208 --> 21:05.875
[sobbing]
No, no.

21:05.959 --> 21:07.166
- No!
- Yeah.

21:08.834 --> 21:10.625
We're going
to have some fun now.

21:16.250 --> 21:17.500
Not in the woods.

21:18.375 --> 21:19.792
Not in the woods!

21:22.709 --> 21:24.667
(Lilly)
'Jacob came back.'

21:24.750 --> 21:25.959
Raped your mother.

21:26.041 --> 21:27.875
(George)
'We see things even when'

21:27.959 --> 21:30.250
it seems, we don't.

21:30.333 --> 21:32.375
Like you.

21:32.458 --> 21:34.875
Hiding in the closet.
Watching.

21:38.500 --> 21:40.458
Better than porn, that.

21:41.458 --> 21:43.542
Why are you telling me this?

21:43.625 --> 21:46.083
To show me
what a monster you are?

21:46.166 --> 21:48.083
Apt word choice..

21:48.166 --> 21:50.208
"...monster."

21:50.291 --> 21:53.834
- Now, you tell me something.
- 'What?'

21:53.917 --> 21:56.250
'Do you keep a photo
of my mother at your bedside'

21:56.333 --> 21:58.083
'like you do
of all your victims?'

22:00.667 --> 22:02.667
How do you know that?

22:02.750 --> 22:05.041
you,

22:05.125 --> 22:06.792
'Everything about you.'

22:09.458 --> 22:11.375
(Lilly)
'You've been
in my house, George?'

22:11.458 --> 22:13.250
Not necessary..

22:13.333 --> 22:15.417
...to know that.

22:15.500 --> 22:17.375
'Who else would be
your

22:18.500 --> 22:20.125
...except dead people?

22:24.125 --> 22:25.333
George?

22:32.333 --> 22:34.625
Heard you went
back that night, scumbag.

22:34.709 --> 22:36.083
Got freaky
with the blind girl?

22:36.166 --> 22:37.083
I didn't go back.

22:37.166 --> 22:39.250
Yeah. Lab's got your DNA.

22:39.333 --> 22:40.500
'It's only
a matter of time till they'

22:40.583 --> 22:41.709
match it to that semen.

22:41.792 --> 22:43.208
Labs mess up.

22:44.375 --> 22:45.792
Got a witness, too.

22:46.834 --> 22:48.792
Her 12-year-old
saw it all go down.

22:52.667 --> 22:55.000
- Okay.
- Okay, what?

22:56.166 --> 22:58.583
I did a rape,
like I do.

22:59.792 --> 23:00.959
Uh-huh.

23:06.792 --> 23:08.250
And I just wanted out.

23:28.041 --> 23:29.375
Whoa, kid.

23:32.041 --> 23:33.500
(Jacob)
'Take it easy.'

23:35.041 --> 23:36.959
Hey, put down the gun!

23:38.834 --> 23:40.333
Not in the woods.

23:42.291 --> 23:43.792
What?

23:43.875 --> 23:46.000
How could you
know that?

23:46.083 --> 23:48.667
- About the woods?
- Uff!

23:48.750 --> 23:50.250
If you can't see,
Mother?

23:50.333 --> 23:53.125
Stop talking, George.

23:59.959 --> 24:01.875
No!

24:01.959 --> 24:03.083
Forgive me.

24:16.959 --> 24:19.291
George shot his mother?

24:19.375 --> 24:20.583
Point-blank.

24:27.291 --> 24:29.041
- Why?
- Don't ask me, man.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.875
The kid was loony tunes.

24:30.959 --> 24:32.291
(Nick)
'And you're saying..'

24:32.375 --> 24:33.709
...she wasn't blind?

24:35.250 --> 24:38.041
Looking down the barrel
of that gun, she wasn't.

24:40.333 --> 24:42.417
Well, George's mother
could see.

24:42.500 --> 24:44.375
"We see things
even when it seems we don't."

24:44.458 --> 24:45.875
So that's
what George meant.

24:45.959 --> 24:47.667
So we saying she was
faking blindness all
along?

24:47.750 --> 24:50.542
She was crazy.
Maybe in her mind, it was
true.

24:50.625 --> 24:52.500
So we know she was blind
until that moment

24:52.583 --> 24:54.667
in the attic
right before the rape.

24:54.750 --> 24:57.667
And "not in the woods,"
she said.

24:57.750 --> 24:59.709
Well, what woods
was she talking about?

24:59.792 --> 25:01.208
(John)
Alright, we traced
George's call.

25:01.291 --> 25:02.917
It was made
from a pay phone.

25:03.000 --> 25:04.041
Where?

25:04.125 --> 25:06.667
The Tinicum
Wildlife
Reserve.

25:06.750 --> 25:08.291
Where he dumped the bodies.

25:08.375 --> 25:09.750
Where it all started,
in the woods.

25:09.834 --> 25:11.000
(Detective DeSalle)
'So what's his game?'

25:11.083 --> 25:12.333
Well, it smells
like a setup.

25:12.417 --> 25:13.917
We're heading out.
You stay here, Lil.

25:15.959 --> 25:17.250
What?

25:17.333 --> 25:20.083
You heard me.
It's you he wants. Let's go.

25:34.000 --> 25:36.750
(Lilly)
'What do you want them to see?'

26:05.709 --> 26:06.917
That's it.

26:18.125 --> 26:19.291
John!

26:24.875 --> 26:26.291
What is it?

27:18.792 --> 27:20.000
Head's missing.

27:20.083 --> 27:21.250
Multiple gunshots.

27:21.333 --> 27:23.333
Usually takes 'em out
with one.

27:23.417 --> 27:24.917
Knife wounds, too.

27:25.000 --> 27:26.709
'That's new.'

27:26.792 --> 27:28.250
His pattern's changing.

27:30.000 --> 27:31.250
He's bored..

27:33.250 --> 27:34.917
...or he's out of control.

28:34.542 --> 28:35.959
That's why the woods.

28:38.208 --> 28:39.667
This is the woods.

28:45.917 --> 28:48.333
(George)
'I told you long ago..'

28:48.417 --> 28:50.750
...we would go
hunting together..

28:50.834 --> 28:52.417
...in the woods.

28:54.542 --> 28:55.834
You and I.

29:05.583 --> 29:08.625
They papered
over the walls.

29:08.709 --> 29:11.375
- What a shame.
- To hide the blood?

29:12.959 --> 29:15.959
But the past never quite goes
away, does it, Lilly?

29:19.000 --> 29:20.041
No, it doesn't.

29:24.792 --> 29:27.458
Phone. Uh-uh.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.375
Oops.

29:38.458 --> 29:40.709
Weapon, I meant.

29:46.959 --> 29:49.583
Now the phone.

29:49.667 --> 29:51.500
'And no..'

29:51.583 --> 29:54.375
'...Lilly tricks, hmm?'

30:05.667 --> 30:08.041
Welcome to my past.

30:08.125 --> 30:10.041
An empty room..

30:10.125 --> 30:11.583
...with nothing
but your mind..

30:11.667 --> 30:13.375
...splashed
on the
walls.

30:13.458 --> 30:15.834
Your mother
faked her blindness.

30:15.917 --> 30:17.000
Is that why
you killed her?

30:18.625 --> 30:20.625
Hysterical
blindness
is the term

30:20.709 --> 30:23.667
one need only to
believe to
become.

30:23.750 --> 30:26.750
But you didn't
understand that then.

30:26.834 --> 30:29.834
You were just
a lonely 12-year-old..

30:29.917 --> 30:31.250
...in a lonely world.

30:31.333 --> 30:33.125
Loneliness is
for the weak..

30:34.500 --> 30:36.458
...and for those
who desire love.

30:39.333 --> 30:41.000
Neither apply.

30:44.667 --> 30:46.834
Then why did
you bring me here, George?

30:49.125 --> 30:50.375
To kill you.

31:01.458 --> 31:02.709
Why now?

31:02.792 --> 31:06.417
Oh, hunting has become
a tedious game..

31:06.500 --> 31:08.375
...since I met you, Lilly.

31:14.291 --> 31:16.875
Even Atalanta
lost her charm.

31:20.083 --> 31:21.792
The one who survived.

31:25.834 --> 31:27.375
What'd you do to her?

31:28.792 --> 31:30.208
Dee Dee Cooper.

31:30.291 --> 31:31.458
Oh, God,
we met this
girl.

31:31.542 --> 31:32.667
Interviewed her
in these woods.

31:32.750 --> 31:34.083
Atalanta,
the one that got away.

31:34.166 --> 31:35.333
The first time.

31:35.417 --> 31:37.291
- You get Lil yet?
- She ain't at PPD.

31:37.375 --> 31:39.250
- I told her to stay there.
- Well, she ain't there.

31:39.333 --> 31:40.959
And her cell keeps
bumping me to
voicemail.

31:41.041 --> 31:42.834
- Then let's go to the house.
- Why?

31:42.917 --> 31:45.291
'Cause that's where
he takes the heads.

31:45.375 --> 31:49.375
Poor Dee Dee.
How she begged..

31:50.250 --> 31:51.625
'...in the woods.'

31:53.083 --> 31:55.125
Like you will.

31:55.208 --> 31:58.250
Because in the woods
you're God, right?

31:59.041 --> 32:00.834
God's a sociopath.

32:00.917 --> 32:04.291
Free from all pretense
of love and loyalty.

32:06.083 --> 32:08.125
- Like you.
- And you.

32:08.208 --> 32:10.083
Disposing of those
you purport to care for

32:10.166 --> 32:11.375
like your dirty little sis.

32:11.458 --> 32:13.875
'Sticky fingers
on Lilly's hubby-to-be.'

32:13.959 --> 32:16.500
Real bitch in heat,
that one.

32:18.041 --> 32:19.667
I don't even
think that about her.

32:19.750 --> 32:21.041
You have.

32:25.583 --> 32:26.959
Your mother was stripped..

32:28.083 --> 32:29.166
...shot in the chest..

32:29.250 --> 32:30.417
But in the end,
you would've found

32:30.500 --> 32:31.750
another reason
to leave him, hmm?

32:31.834 --> 32:34.959
Just like Tina,
Janet, all of them.

32:35.041 --> 32:37.750
'You replicate
her murder over and over.'

32:38.917 --> 32:40.291
But why the running?

32:42.291 --> 32:43.875
Your mother didn't run.

32:45.500 --> 32:48.542
Your junior college degree..

32:48.625 --> 32:51.166
...equips you
for pop psychology

32:51.250 --> 32:54.250
and a low-level five-figure
income, not much else.

32:54.333 --> 32:56.041
Why do you make them run?

32:58.375 --> 32:59.542
Why?

33:06.125 --> 33:08.667
You were running, right?

33:09.750 --> 33:11.500
'Why?'

33:11.583 --> 33:12.792
Trying to find help?

33:13.917 --> 33:15.667
Stop him from hurting
your mother?

33:17.792 --> 33:20.375
Her granny panties
all in a bunch.

33:20.458 --> 33:21.834
Who could resist that?

33:23.750 --> 33:25.041
Your turn now..

33:26.291 --> 33:27.625
...to tell me.

33:29.542 --> 33:30.500
Tell you what?

33:30.583 --> 33:32.500
How little Lilly ran..

33:32.583 --> 33:33.750
...long ago.

33:40.917 --> 33:42.208
Still ain't answering.

33:42.291 --> 33:43.834
It's her car.

33:43.917 --> 33:46.583
(George)
'Detective Valens,
how nice of you to come.'

33:48.333 --> 33:50.375
- What do you want with Lilly?
- 'Hm.'

33:50.458 --> 33:52.125
(George over phone)
'I never sent
my condolences, did I'

33:52.208 --> 33:53.458
<i>fiance?'</i>

33:53.542 --> 33:55.834
'Oh, the river
can do terrible things'

33:55.917 --> 33:57.500
'to a girl's complexion.'

34:00.417 --> 34:03.083
You hurt her, George..

34:03.166 --> 34:04.291
...I'll murder you.

34:04.375 --> 34:07.208
[gun cocking]
A gentle reminder..

34:07.291 --> 34:08.458
...to mind your manners.

34:08.542 --> 34:10.583
Now put your boss
on the phone.

34:16.125 --> 34:17.625
George..

34:17.709 --> 34:19.291
...let's work this out.

34:19.375 --> 34:21.125
(George over phone)
'One courtesy call,
its purpose'

34:21.208 --> 34:24.625
to disabuse you of storming
the Alamo guns blazing.

34:24.709 --> 34:26.291
'If you call again,
if I see a cop'

34:26.375 --> 34:29.125
'within a 100 yards
of this house'

34:29.208 --> 34:30.917
I put a bullet..

34:31.000 --> 34:32.500
...in her head.

34:32.583 --> 34:34.583
No one's gotta
die
here, George.

34:37.208 --> 34:38.875
Too bad you couldn't save her.

34:41.375 --> 34:43.208
Save who?

34:43.291 --> 34:44.709
Your daughter.

34:44.792 --> 34:47.792
'From the big, bad wolf.
His sharp, wet teeth.'

34:50.917 --> 34:52.458
Let me talk to Lilly, George.

34:52.542 --> 34:54.417
A real father
would have eviscerated

34:54.500 --> 34:56.667
'the thug who soiled
his little girl.'

34:56.750 --> 35:00.583
But you, you just talked.

35:00.667 --> 35:01.834
(John)
'Now, you listen to me.'

35:01.917 --> 35:05.000
You won't get
out
of this alive

35:05.083 --> 35:08.125
without my help, George.

35:08.208 --> 35:09.166
I know all about your help.

35:09.250 --> 35:11.959
It comes 18 years too late.

35:13.041 --> 35:14.834
'And true to form'

35:14.917 --> 35:17.208
'you're too late
for Lilly, too.'

35:23.709 --> 35:24.917
(George)
'So..'

35:27.083 --> 35:28.542
...where were we?

35:31.125 --> 35:33.041
Game's over.

35:33.125 --> 35:34.583
It's only a matter
of time now.

35:34.667 --> 35:36.709
You were telling me
how you ran.

35:39.041 --> 35:40.458
You're gonna die
in here, too.

35:40.542 --> 35:42.208
Tell me how you ran.

35:43.667 --> 35:44.625
No.

35:46.125 --> 35:47.709
You've never told anyone

35:47.792 --> 35:49.875
what happened
to little Lilly long ago

35:49.959 --> 35:52.041
'but you want to tell.'

35:52.125 --> 35:53.083
'Mm-hmm?'

35:53.166 --> 35:54.041
Not you.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.792
Well, I'm the only one left.

35:55.875 --> 35:57.875
<i>tell me.</i>

36:02.041 --> 36:04.041
I was 10.

36:04.125 --> 36:06.041
On my way
to the store. It was..

36:08.166 --> 36:10.000
'...dark out, late.'

36:10.083 --> 36:12.291
And that's when the bad man
came for you?

36:15.333 --> 36:16.583
I ran.

36:20.166 --> 36:21.417
But he caught me.

36:21.500 --> 36:22.917
Did he touch you?

36:23.959 --> 36:25.250
In your secret place?

36:29.000 --> 36:30.750
He wanted my money.

36:30.834 --> 36:32.917
'That's why
he followed me.'

36:33.000 --> 36:34.500
I gave him what I had.

36:34.583 --> 36:36.417
And then he went
his merry way.

36:38.834 --> 36:40.375
You know he didn't.

36:44.542 --> 36:46.500
- Tell me what he did.
- He hit me.

36:48.417 --> 36:49.667
I don't remember
much after that.

36:49.750 --> 36:51.750
Fractured jaw,
five broken teeth.

36:51.834 --> 36:53.625
Pretty little face not so
pretty
when he was through with you.

36:53.709 --> 36:55.625
I fought,
but he wouldn't stop.

36:55.709 --> 36:57.625
But he just,
he kept hitting me

36:57.709 --> 37:00.583
and-and hitting me
and laughing.

37:04.083 --> 37:05.458
I didn't want to die..

37:06.834 --> 37:09.041
...so I fought.

37:16.250 --> 37:18.208
We're alike,
you and I.

37:20.875 --> 37:21.875
[chuckles]
How so?

37:21.959 --> 37:23.375
Now, you fought too.

37:24.667 --> 37:26.333
That's why
you

37:27.834 --> 37:29.333
'Jacob found you
in the closet..'

37:30.208 --> 37:31.291
'...cornered you.'

37:31.375 --> 37:34.917
- No.
- And you fought, like me.

37:42.291 --> 37:44.625
No! Let go of me.

37:46.041 --> 37:48.125
No.. Move back you..

37:55.500 --> 37:57.166
Then you ran.

37:57.250 --> 37:58.500
But the doors were locked

37:58.583 --> 38:00.667
the windows nailed shut.

38:00.750 --> 38:03.417
He hunted you down
in that house like an animal.

38:03.500 --> 38:06.458
- I'm not an animal.
- That's why you pick
fighters.

38:09.166 --> 38:10.500
How'd he know you were
in that closet, George?

38:10.583 --> 38:12.000
Want to know
what I'm wondering?

38:12.083 --> 38:14.000
I'm wondering who would
send a 10-year-old girl

38:14.083 --> 38:16.000
'to the store late
at night all alone?'

38:16.083 --> 38:18.625
That's what
I'm wondering.

38:20.542 --> 38:22.917
SWAT will have sharpshooters
in position 10 minutes tops.

38:23.000 --> 38:25.625
She doesn't have 10 minutes,
Scotty. I'm goin' in.

38:25.709 --> 38:27.542
Well, he was real clear
about violating the
perimeter.

38:27.625 --> 38:30.083
He's blind on the south
of the house. I can enter
there.

38:30.166 --> 38:31.667
Yeah, then he puts
a bullet in her
head.

38:31.750 --> 38:33.333
Look, you do
this,
you'll kill her!

38:34.583 --> 38:36.083
He's gonna kill her anyway.

38:37.959 --> 38:39.083
Look, boss..

38:39.166 --> 38:40.834
I'm not losing her
too, Scotty.

38:47.542 --> 38:49.250
Who sent you
to the store, Lilly?

38:49.333 --> 38:50.875
I'd go there
all the time.

38:52.333 --> 38:53.375
The owner knew me.

38:53.458 --> 38:55.667
Answer the
question, Lilly.

38:58.166 --> 39:00.375
[sobbing]
My mother.

39:00.458 --> 39:01.709
Why?

39:08.000 --> 39:09.458
She needed a drink.

39:12.000 --> 39:13.208
Sold out..

39:14.458 --> 39:17.125
...by the person
who loved you most.

39:17.208 --> 39:19.750
'Hm, hm, hm.'

39:19.834 --> 39:22.208
No wonder little Lilly
likes to play with the dead.

39:25.917 --> 39:28.000
Who sold you out, George?

39:28.083 --> 39:29.750
'Because what
I'm wondering is'

39:29.834 --> 39:32.375
how did Jacob know you were
hiding in that closet?

39:33.500 --> 39:34.750
You stop talking.

39:34.834 --> 39:37.792
"Forgive me,"
your mother said.

39:37.875 --> 39:39.333
- For what?
- Shut up.

39:39.417 --> 39:41.542
She told Jacob
where to find you, didn't
she?

39:41.625 --> 39:42.959
You shut up!

39:44.166 --> 39:46.291
Your mother wasn't raped
in this attic.

39:46.375 --> 39:48.333
You shut up!
You shut up!

39:48.417 --> 39:50.542
You shut up!
You shut up!

39:50.625 --> 39:52.000
You were.

39:57.041 --> 39:58.291
Not in the woods!

39:58.375 --> 40:00.417
- Sit down!
- Not in the woods!

40:00.500 --> 40:01.834
Not in the woods.

40:02.875 --> 40:05.458
No. No-no-no.
In the closet.

40:05.542 --> 40:07.458
In the closet. The boy.

40:08.458 --> 40:10.750
Do it to him,
not me.

40:10.834 --> 40:11.792
Do it to him.

40:20.709 --> 40:23.417
He brought you up here
<i>raped you</i>

40:23.500 --> 40:26.208
<i>watched.</i>

40:26.291 --> 40:29.625
I am God
in these woods.

40:29.709 --> 40:32.000
No, George.

40:32.083 --> 40:33.458
You're a little boy..

40:34.792 --> 40:36.792
...whose mother
didn't love him.

40:38.000 --> 40:39.917
Who sold him out.

40:41.834 --> 40:43.166
Like you.

40:48.542 --> 40:50.041
It's time you learned..

41:02.917 --> 41:04.709
Down on the ground, George.

41:04.792 --> 41:06.333
...about freedom.

41:08.000 --> 41:09.333
On the ground!

41:13.125 --> 41:15.667
When you kill me..

41:15.750 --> 41:17.208
...the only thing
that separates you and I

41:17.291 --> 41:18.291
is who pulls the trigger.

41:20.417 --> 41:22.875
Don't make me do that.

41:22.959 --> 41:24.709
- I don't want to kill you.
- Yes, you do.

41:24.792 --> 41:26.834
That's why you came.

41:26.917 --> 41:29.875
We are alike,
you and I.

41:29.959 --> 41:31.792
I'm nothing like you.

41:31.875 --> 41:33.500
You sleep with the dead.

41:34.625 --> 41:37.250
You're already halfway there.

41:37.333 --> 41:39.583
'And when you kill me..'

41:39.667 --> 41:43.583
'...even those photos
you cling to will fade
away.'

41:44.709 --> 41:46.917
Like everyone
fades away for you.

41:48.375 --> 41:50.291
And you will be alone..

41:52.208 --> 41:53.625
...like me.

41:54.625 --> 41:55.959
You're wrong.

41:56.041 --> 41:57.625
I'll never be like you.

41:58.625 --> 41:59.834
Want to bet?
