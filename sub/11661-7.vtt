01:18.467 --> 01:19.633
Rose, what are you doing?

01:19.700 --> 01:21.100
I'm diapering a turkey.

01:23.100 --> 01:27.700
It's been so long,
I'm practicing before the baby gets here.

01:28.767 --> 01:30.867
(Dorothy) Ma...
Hello, Martha.

01:30.934 --> 01:31.934
Where were you?

01:32.000 --> 01:33.000
Here's a hint.

01:33.066 --> 01:34.800
The guest of honor
had lipstick on her teeth

01:34.867 --> 01:35.900
and didn't give a damn.

01:38.467 --> 01:39.600
Who died?

01:39.667 --> 01:42.734
-My best friend Lydia.
-I'm sorry.

01:42.800 --> 01:45.600
She suffered,
so, it's a blessing in disguise.

01:45.667 --> 01:48.000
Why do blessings wear disguises?

01:48.066 --> 01:50.266
If I were a blessing,
I'd run around naked.

01:51.467 --> 01:53.867
-(doorbell chimes)
-Oh, that's the baby.

01:53.934 --> 01:55.133
There's a baby coming?

01:55.200 --> 01:59.800
Some church friends are going camping.
We're caring for the baby.

01:59.867 --> 02:02.166
Good.
Maybe now you'll get some food I can chew.

02:05.233 --> 02:06.834
How about a cup of tea, Martha?

02:06.900 --> 02:07.867
A little.

02:08.433 --> 02:10.567
I ate like a pig at the funeral.

02:10.633 --> 02:12.700
Everybody had a good time.

02:12.767 --> 02:14.500
I'll miss her so much.

02:14.567 --> 02:15.667
(Sophia) I know.

02:15.734 --> 02:20.633
But these last weeks were so hard on her.
Now she's resting peacefully.

02:20.700 --> 02:23.033
I feel so bad.

02:23.100 --> 02:26.600
I should feel bad.
Lydia and I were wearing the same dress.

02:27.700 --> 02:28.567
(chuckles)

02:31.967 --> 02:33.600
Honey, can we go now?

02:33.667 --> 02:35.100
I've been planning this for months.

02:35.166 --> 02:37.600
A weekend alone in the woods.

02:37.667 --> 02:39.166
Sounds romantic.

02:39.233 --> 02:40.834
Maybe you'll have another baby.

02:43.066 --> 02:45.000
I better make sure we packed everything.

02:47.100 --> 02:50.300
Thanks again. Goodbye, Francis. Be good.

02:50.367 --> 02:52.400
Don't worry. Go ahead.

02:52.467 --> 02:55.500
-What a beautiful little thing.
-Yes.

02:55.567 --> 02:57.433
Is it a boy or girl?

02:57.500 --> 02:58.834
Of course.

03:00.734 --> 03:05.667
I mean is it Francis as in Francine
or Francis as in Frank?

03:05.734 --> 03:07.800
I don't know. It's wearing yellow.

03:08.967 --> 03:11.233
-We could find out.
-How?

03:14.133 --> 03:16.233
But on the dolphins game
and see if it watches.

03:16.300 --> 03:18.166
By looking, Rose!

03:19.967 --> 03:23.200
We could change its diaper
and see if it has a winkie.

03:25.567 --> 03:26.500
A winkie?

03:26.567 --> 03:29.333
That's the term when it's little.

03:31.567 --> 03:33.133
But the baby isn't wet.

03:33.200 --> 03:35.100
We'll change it anyway. Here you go.

03:35.166 --> 03:36.567
Here I go?

03:36.633 --> 03:39.567
The best time to change a diaper
is when there's nothing in it.

03:41.433 --> 03:42.900
I'll do it. You can help me.

03:43.300 --> 03:44.300
Okay, ready?

03:45.066 --> 03:47.467
One, two, three.

03:54.300 --> 03:55.300
(all) Frank.

03:57.266 --> 04:00.800
(mellow music playing)

04:03.867 --> 04:04.967
May I help you, madame?

04:05.467 --> 04:07.600
Couldn't I be a mademoiselle?

04:07.667 --> 04:11.600
What man would leave you to languish
on the vine?

04:17.734 --> 04:20.233
If this were Sicily,
you wouldn't have any lips left.

04:21.800 --> 04:24.967
Where's Martha Lamont's table?
Don't fall in love.

04:25.033 --> 04:26.633
Miss Lamont's waiting at the bar.

04:26.700 --> 04:29.166
Maybe she found somebody
who'll pay for dinner.

04:31.300 --> 04:33.700
Martha, you look terrific!

04:34.166 --> 04:35.500
Are those new knee-highs?

04:36.633 --> 04:40.100
It's a new attitude,
eat, drink, and be merry.

04:49.600 --> 04:50.633
Hey, Jacques.

04:52.800 --> 04:54.700
Give me a hand and watch where you put it.

05:02.834 --> 05:04.567
That was better
than I thought it would be.

05:05.567 --> 05:07.734
-Now I can't wait to get down.
-(chuckles)

05:09.400 --> 05:11.700
Would you ladies like drinks?

05:11.767 --> 05:14.867
A Manhattan.
I'm watching, so no cheap stuff.

05:15.233 --> 05:16.934
I'll have another Harvey Wallbanger.

05:17.000 --> 05:19.300
You're seeing a lot
of Mr. Wallbanger tonight.

05:20.600 --> 05:21.734
I'm celebrating.

05:21.800 --> 05:25.033
I've just had an idea
that will change my life.

05:25.100 --> 05:27.233
Order anything you like.

05:27.734 --> 05:31.600
I'm having the shrimp cocktail,
the cream of mushroom soup,

05:31.667 --> 05:35.066
asparagus with hollandaise sauce,
and the filet mignon.

05:35.133 --> 05:37.133
I like cholesterol, too,

05:37.200 --> 05:39.500
but you're never going to get blood
to your feet again.

05:42.367 --> 05:43.867
I'd like to drink a toast.

05:45.233 --> 05:45.967
To Sophia...

05:46.834 --> 05:48.834
whom I hope I can count on.

05:49.667 --> 05:50.333
For what?

05:51.000 --> 05:53.133
Get your lips off Harvey
and tell me what you want.

05:54.200 --> 05:57.133
I want you to do something for me.

05:57.200 --> 05:59.333
Come to my place tomorrow night.

05:59.400 --> 06:00.734
Is it your birthday?

06:01.200 --> 06:03.600
Sophia, there aren't going to be
any more birthdays.

06:04.233 --> 06:05.333
What are you telling me?

06:05.400 --> 06:08.400
(sighs)
I have so much wrong with me,

06:08.467 --> 06:12.667
arthritis, high blood pressure, angina,
just to mention a few.

06:12.734 --> 06:14.600
Who doesn't? You can't play Canasta

06:14.667 --> 06:17.433
unless you've got at least
two debilitating diseases.

06:18.066 --> 06:20.333
-(chuckles)
-(waiter) Your table is ready, mesdames.

06:26.333 --> 06:29.266
The first time was better.
What do you think?

06:29.900 --> 06:31.266
Right this way, please.

06:32.767 --> 06:34.867
So why do you want me
at your house tomorrow?

06:35.500 --> 06:38.000
I want you there when I kill myself.

06:42.633 --> 06:44.033
-(baby crying)
-What is it, Blanche?

06:44.100 --> 06:47.467
I can't quite read it.
Maybe my eyes are tired.

06:48.433 --> 06:49.700
Your eyes are old.

06:51.700 --> 06:54.000
Blanche, when are you going to admit
you need glasses?

06:54.066 --> 06:55.633
I do not need glasses.

06:55.700 --> 06:59.033
My mother didn't need glasses
till the day she died.

06:59.500 --> 07:00.800
And then it seemed silly.

07:02.734 --> 07:04.533
What is his temperature?

07:04.600 --> 07:06.166
I do not know, Dorothy.

07:06.734 --> 07:10.533
Even with perfect eyesight,
nobody can read one of these things.

07:11.300 --> 07:14.166
Oh, my God, it's 103.2.

07:18.133 --> 07:20.333
The poor baby.

07:20.400 --> 07:24.033
-We'd better contact his parents.
-They're out in the woods.

07:24.100 --> 07:25.433
Call Harry.

07:25.500 --> 07:28.266
We're lucky we have a pediatrician nearby.

07:28.333 --> 07:29.867
That's a bad idea.

07:29.934 --> 07:30.633
Why?

07:30.700 --> 07:33.867
By the time I do my hair and face,

07:34.767 --> 07:36.767
that baby could be in serious trouble.

07:36.834 --> 07:38.300
Call his real pediatrician.

07:38.367 --> 07:39.033
Okay.

07:39.533 --> 07:40.967
Pediatrician...

07:41.033 --> 07:42.900
Here it is. Dr. Harry Weston!

07:42.967 --> 07:43.900
Oh, God.

07:43.967 --> 07:46.233
Come on, Blanche, he's a doctor.

07:46.300 --> 07:48.567
He's used to seeing people at their worst.

07:51.166 --> 07:53.934
If you comb your hair,
you can be right in that ball park.

07:56.033 --> 07:57.700
Harry... Dorothy.

07:58.300 --> 08:00.500
I'm sorry to call you at home,

08:00.567 --> 08:02.734
but we're taking care
of the Lillestrand baby.

08:02.800 --> 08:05.100
He's running a high fever.

08:05.166 --> 08:06.800
Could you come over right away?

08:07.533 --> 08:10.200
No, this is not Blanche playing a joke.

08:12.867 --> 08:14.934
Thanks, Harry. Thanks very much.

08:15.000 --> 08:16.333
-He's coming.
-Right away.

08:16.400 --> 08:17.967
I'd better freshen up.

08:18.033 --> 08:21.967
He's not seeing you, he's seeing the baby.

08:22.033 --> 08:24.633
I'll be holding the baby next to my bosom.

08:26.667 --> 08:28.600
What a magnificent picture.

08:29.567 --> 08:31.767
I wish that thing didn't look so sickly.

08:31.834 --> 08:36.133
(baby crying)

08:36.600 --> 08:39.867
Even if you're paying for dinner,
what you're doing is crazy.

08:39.934 --> 08:41.767
It's time to go, Sophia.

08:41.834 --> 08:43.567
I don't want to see another Monday.

08:44.200 --> 08:46.900
I don't want to end up going like Lydia.

08:47.467 --> 08:49.433
I'm going to decide when it's over.

08:49.500 --> 08:51.800
I always thought somebody
named God did that.

08:52.767 --> 08:54.400
You don't understand.

08:54.967 --> 08:58.000
I'm afraid of the pain, of the hurting.

08:58.567 --> 09:01.467
I'm afraid of being alone, of dying alone.

09:01.533 --> 09:02.967
I'll take the pills myself.

09:03.033 --> 09:05.333
Just be there and hold my hand.

09:05.834 --> 09:07.867
You're right. I don't understand.

09:08.266 --> 09:10.000
I'd do anything to stay alive.

09:10.066 --> 09:11.367
If my heart stopped,

09:11.433 --> 09:14.000
I'd want every doctor
jumping up and down on my chest.

09:16.200 --> 09:17.600
You say that now.

09:18.166 --> 09:20.467
I don't have the courage to die by inches.

09:20.934 --> 09:22.734
I'll do it whether you're there or not.

09:23.700 --> 09:24.967
I don't want to die alone.

09:25.033 --> 09:26.467
Please. Help me.

09:27.834 --> 09:30.567
(slow music playing)

09:33.734 --> 09:36.734
(mellow music playing)

09:39.200 --> 09:43.567
(baby crying)

09:45.467 --> 09:48.867
Dorothy, do you think this looks alluring,
yet nurse-like?

09:51.533 --> 09:54.934
I don't know, Blanche.
Maybe the earrings put it over the top.

09:56.066 --> 09:59.533
Those are for the baby.
They love shiny things.

09:59.600 --> 10:02.300
Maybe you two ought to wait
in the kitchen with the kid.

10:04.133 --> 10:05.734
-(doorbell chimes)
-Oh, I'll get it.

10:05.800 --> 10:08.367
Freeze! Give me that thing.

10:13.200 --> 10:15.266
Hello, Frank, darling.

10:15.333 --> 10:16.400
(moans)

10:16.467 --> 10:17.500
How do I look?

10:19.066 --> 10:22.133
It's all wrong, Blanche.
The baby doesn't match your shoes.

10:26.800 --> 10:27.967
-Oh...
-Hello, ladies.

10:28.033 --> 10:32.166
-Thanks, Harry.
-Frank, Frank, Frank, talk to me.

10:32.233 --> 10:33.333
What's going on here?

10:33.400 --> 10:35.200
He isn't feeling very well,

10:35.266 --> 10:37.767
so we thought we'd have you over
for a drink.

10:42.533 --> 10:45.433
Why don't we forget the baby
and go dancing?

10:45.500 --> 10:46.633
Oh!

10:46.700 --> 10:50.100
-Blanche, that is some outfit.
-(chuckles)

10:50.533 --> 10:51.767
What do you call that?

10:51.834 --> 10:53.300
A negligee.

10:54.700 --> 10:57.200
-Brings back fond memories.
-(chuckles sexily)

10:57.266 --> 10:59.333
Mother had one like it.

11:02.633 --> 11:04.533
Here, take him. He's wet.

11:05.800 --> 11:09.033
Change him,
or he'll get a rash on his winkie.

11:11.734 --> 11:16.467
We're sorry to disturb you,
but he's running a fever of 103.

11:16.533 --> 11:18.000
What could it be?

11:18.066 --> 11:22.734
He could be teething. It could be flu.
Maybe he's just a hypochondriac.

11:24.000 --> 11:24.934
Really?

11:27.200 --> 11:28.433
Well, let's take a look.

11:28.500 --> 11:31.233
So, you've been keeping
these ladies busy, huh?

11:31.300 --> 11:32.467
Oh, I didn't mind.

11:32.533 --> 11:35.867
I have such a highly developed
maternal instinct.

11:41.900 --> 11:44.600
I... I was talking to the baby, Blanche.

11:44.667 --> 11:46.967
Any other symptoms? Rash or...

11:47.033 --> 11:50.166
No.
First, he was fine, then he was feverish.

11:50.233 --> 11:52.533
Is it the usual?

11:53.133 --> 11:55.767
Frank tends to get ear infections
from time to time.

11:55.834 --> 11:56.834
Will he be all right?

11:56.900 --> 11:59.700
He'll be fine. Watch him closely.

12:00.166 --> 12:03.533
Give him four drops now,
then once every two hours.

12:03.600 --> 12:06.200
Give him fluids
so he doesn't get dehydrated.

12:06.266 --> 12:09.066
I'll check on you tomorrow.

12:09.600 --> 12:11.233
When are we supposed to sleep?

12:11.867 --> 12:14.467
Not that I mind. I was born to heal.

12:14.533 --> 12:16.033
Heel, Blanche!

12:18.400 --> 12:20.467
Welcome back to motherhood.

12:20.533 --> 12:22.600
Surely, you were good mothers
and remember what to do.

12:22.667 --> 12:25.333
Blanche, watch the others.
You pick up things quickly.

12:25.400 --> 12:26.467
Got to go.

12:26.834 --> 12:27.600
Bye.

12:28.266 --> 12:31.266
(lively music playing)

12:35.300 --> 12:37.867
(baby cries)

12:37.934 --> 12:39.867
What is wrong with this baby?

12:39.934 --> 12:43.600
Honey darling,
please shut up for Aunt Blanche.

12:44.967 --> 12:49.600
In St. Olaf, we had a surefire method
for getting babies to sleep.

12:49.667 --> 12:54.100
If Herring, Elk, or Sven figure in this,
I don't want to hear it.

12:55.433 --> 12:56.900
Okay, here's another one.

12:58.233 --> 13:00.900
Whenever my kids couldn't sleep,
we always sang to them.

13:00.967 --> 13:01.834
A lullaby.

13:01.900 --> 13:04.100
Sort of, "Mr. Sandman".

13:04.567 --> 13:06.433
Oh, I don't know, Rose.

13:06.500 --> 13:09.166
Come on, it's worth a try.

13:09.233 --> 13:11.400
It's either we sing, or he sings.

13:12.033 --> 13:13.133
All right.

13:13.200 --> 13:14.700

13:22.367 --> 13:23.767

and then yours until we're all booming.

Boy, you guys really stink.

14:42.600 --> 14:45.200
-(sighs)
-We were singing the baby to sleep.

14:45.266 --> 14:46.700
It was waking me up.

14:47.800 --> 14:50.000
Let's go to the kitchen.

14:50.066 --> 14:51.633
-To talk.
-To eat.

14:51.700 --> 14:52.367
Better.

14:54.467 --> 14:57.533
Ma, we're sorry our singing woke you.

14:57.600 --> 14:58.633
It wasn't you.

14:59.367 --> 15:01.000
I had a horrible nightmare.

15:01.066 --> 15:05.533
My uncle Giuseppe came down
from heaven pointing a finger at me,

15:06.000 --> 15:07.000
I think it was a finger.

15:12.200 --> 15:15.367
Warning that if I did a certain thing,
I wouldn't get to heaven.

15:15.433 --> 15:16.767
What thing?

15:16.834 --> 15:18.033
Try murder.

15:18.100 --> 15:20.166
It was just a dream.

15:20.233 --> 15:21.967
It's not just a dream.

15:22.934 --> 15:24.600
Martha wants to commit suicide.

15:25.467 --> 15:27.100
And she wants me to be there with her.

15:28.200 --> 15:29.767
What did you say?

15:30.433 --> 15:31.400
Said I'd think about it.

15:32.433 --> 15:35.266
You can't say no to somebody
paying for a $75 dinner.

15:35.333 --> 15:36.266
Tell them, Blanche.

15:44.533 --> 15:47.700
Ma, I can't believe
that you're seriously considering

15:47.767 --> 15:49.333
getting involved in this.

15:49.967 --> 15:52.934
Martha's a sick woman
and doesn't want to get any sicker.

15:53.000 --> 15:55.700
She's doing it anyway.
Why should she die alone?

15:55.767 --> 15:57.633
This is wrong, Sophia.

15:57.700 --> 15:59.834
Forget about whether this is right
or wrong.

15:59.900 --> 16:01.934
I'm worried about you.

16:02.600 --> 16:05.467
When Martha takes those pills,
or whatever,

16:05.533 --> 16:08.133
and... and the life drains out of her,

16:08.200 --> 16:11.600
you're going to be in that room alone.

16:12.166 --> 16:13.533
What are you going to do?

16:14.233 --> 16:15.500
How will you feel?

16:15.967 --> 16:17.600
Who knows? I'll handle it.

16:18.166 --> 16:22.000
When my time comes,
I hope someone puts me out of my misery

16:22.066 --> 16:25.700
if something tragic happens,
like a fatal illness,

16:25.767 --> 16:27.934
or I've lost my looks.

16:31.467 --> 16:33.000
Tell us when, Blanche.

16:35.734 --> 16:37.934
I forbid you to do this.

16:38.000 --> 16:40.066
You forget I'm the mother here.

16:40.133 --> 16:41.433
That means nothing.

16:41.500 --> 16:43.000
That means everything.

16:43.066 --> 16:45.800
With my extra 25 years,
I've learned something.

16:46.633 --> 16:48.467
I wish I could remember what it is.

16:50.333 --> 16:51.400
Oh, yeah. I got it.

16:51.867 --> 16:55.033
It's not whether you agree
or disagree with somebody.

16:55.100 --> 16:58.066
It's whether you can be there
when they need you.

16:58.133 --> 17:00.767
I can't believe you're doing this.

17:01.166 --> 17:04.533
This reminds me of the story
of Gunilla Ulfstadder,

17:05.200 --> 17:07.967
St. Olaf's very own angel of death.

17:08.033 --> 17:09.734
Tell it, Rose, tell it.

17:11.033 --> 17:12.667
Really? All the way through?

17:14.867 --> 17:15.700
All the way through,

17:15.767 --> 17:19.467
but make the end come as close
to the beginning as possible.

17:20.900 --> 17:25.667
Gunilla Ulfstadder was a nurse
at Cedar's of St. Olaf hospital.

17:26.700 --> 17:29.533
One night she was taking care
of Sven Bjornson,

17:30.333 --> 17:33.767
and he asked her if she'd get him
some more mouth moisteners

17:33.834 --> 17:35.000
and then kill him.

17:35.800 --> 17:38.400
Gunilla brought the mouth moisteners
right away,

17:38.467 --> 17:43.066
but the killing thing seemed to go
against everything she'd been taught.

17:43.133 --> 17:44.934
You're doing beautifully, Rose.

17:45.400 --> 17:48.600
But he begged, and he begged,
and by her coffee break,

17:48.667 --> 17:49.967
she couldn't stand it anymore,

17:50.033 --> 17:53.133
so she pulled the plug, and he died.

17:54.066 --> 17:57.000
She was wracked with guilt that night.

17:57.066 --> 18:01.066
Not only had she parked her car
in a doctor's spot,

18:02.533 --> 18:07.467
but she was never sure whether
Sven's pleading was the pain talking

18:07.533 --> 18:11.033
or the medication talking
or the guy in the next bed talking.

18:13.166 --> 18:16.567
You see, the guy in the next bed
was Ingmar von Burgen,

18:16.633 --> 18:19.266
St. Olaf's meanest ventriloquist.

18:27.533 --> 18:31.000
Go somewhere with this.

18:31.066 --> 18:33.500
If not, I'm gonna cut out your tongue.

18:34.834 --> 18:35.900
Yes.

18:35.967 --> 18:38.367
Sven came back to haunt her.

18:38.767 --> 18:42.533
Every Tuesday night at 10, 9 central.

18:42.600 --> 18:43.300
(thumps)

18:45.800 --> 18:47.600
She hears noises.

18:47.934 --> 18:49.333
Some say it's the wind,

18:49.400 --> 18:54.867
but some say it's Sven's voice
whispering back from the other side,

18:54.934 --> 18:58.233
saying, "Turn around quick.
His lips are moving."

19:05.667 --> 19:06.633
You see that, Ma?

19:08.734 --> 19:12.533
You kill someone,
you end up being a Rose story.

19:14.567 --> 19:16.100
Is this what you want?

19:16.934 --> 19:18.734
Dorothy, I'll worry about me later.

19:19.300 --> 19:20.300
I got to do this.

19:21.266 --> 19:22.400
Good night, pussycat.

19:23.500 --> 19:26.500
(somber music playing)

19:32.834 --> 19:33.900
(Martha) Oh!

19:33.967 --> 19:35.100
You came!

19:35.166 --> 19:36.367
I said I would.

19:36.433 --> 19:37.200
Come in.

19:37.800 --> 19:39.100
Come in and sit down.

19:40.133 --> 19:41.333
I have something to show you.

19:42.567 --> 19:43.233
Look!

19:43.834 --> 19:46.033
10 carats and not a flaw.

19:46.100 --> 19:48.467
I bought it today, on time.
(chuckles)

19:50.100 --> 19:51.567
Very nice.

19:52.533 --> 19:55.934
Look, I was thinking,
maybe you shouldn't go through with this.

19:56.000 --> 19:57.066
No, I have to go.

19:57.600 --> 19:59.100
I've never felt so happy.

20:00.734 --> 20:01.600
Do you like the ring?

20:01.667 --> 20:03.934
Reminds me of a doorknob
I had back in Brooklyn.

20:04.000 --> 20:04.900
(Martha laughs)

20:05.934 --> 20:08.800
-What are you doing?
-It's my way of saying thanks.

20:09.433 --> 20:11.667
I've taken care of everything.

20:12.133 --> 20:15.066
Don't let them put lipstick on my teeth.

20:15.133 --> 20:16.200
Don't worry.

20:16.266 --> 20:18.333
I'll take them out
and check them personally.

20:19.967 --> 20:20.667
Well...

20:21.667 --> 20:22.734
I guess, uh...

20:24.100 --> 20:25.133
It's time to go.

20:27.367 --> 20:28.433
You will hold my hand?

20:28.900 --> 20:30.033
Sure, I will.

20:30.567 --> 20:33.400
I'm so glad I don't have to go alone.

20:36.100 --> 20:38.166
You remember how we met?

20:39.166 --> 20:42.467
Eight years ago,
we shared a hospital room.

20:43.000 --> 20:45.233
You had the heart scare,
I was the gall bladder.

20:45.300 --> 20:47.300
You got my sponge bath.

20:47.367 --> 20:48.967
You ate my Jell-O.

20:49.033 --> 20:51.700
We couldn't wait to get out of there.

20:51.767 --> 20:53.033
We wanted to live.

20:53.100 --> 20:54.166
Yes. I remember.

20:54.233 --> 20:56.400
Remember better. Remember life.

20:58.800 --> 21:00.166
I don't have much of one.

21:00.734 --> 21:01.900
I'm not like you.

21:02.533 --> 21:05.000
You live with friends and family...

21:05.600 --> 21:07.400
holidays and warmth.

21:08.834 --> 21:11.000
I... hear the silence.

21:11.567 --> 21:12.266
We'll talk.

21:12.900 --> 21:16.734
We'll talk all the time.
Come over holidays, every Friday night.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.500
I may not be there,
but you can talk to Rose.

21:21.533 --> 21:22.700
No, I want to go.

21:23.100 --> 21:24.667
Lydia looked so peaceful.

21:25.333 --> 21:27.367
We're not in this life for peace.

21:27.900 --> 21:30.100
-You're crying?
-I'm not.

21:30.166 --> 21:31.100
I see your tears.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.033
You know what your tears say?

21:33.100 --> 21:36.300
-What?
-You're not ready to die.

21:36.367 --> 21:38.166
You still want to live, kid.

21:38.633 --> 21:39.700
Some kid.

21:40.867 --> 21:42.600
I don't know what to do.

21:42.667 --> 21:46.233
If you're not sure,
you can't change your mind tomorrow.

21:47.100 --> 21:49.100
You wanted me here for your death.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.233
How about letting me be here
for your life?

21:52.867 --> 21:54.100
Like a friend?

21:54.834 --> 21:56.734
Like a best friend.

21:58.600 --> 22:01.600
(somber music playing)

22:08.734 --> 22:11.600
Dorothy, sit down. Pacing won't help.

22:11.667 --> 22:14.266
I can't stop thinking about Ma.

22:14.333 --> 22:15.467
Look at that!

22:15.533 --> 22:17.500
Perfect. 98.6.

22:17.967 --> 22:19.967
That's what it looks like to me.

22:20.734 --> 22:23.033
Thank God. That means he's better.

22:23.100 --> 22:24.333
(sighs)
Here.

22:24.400 --> 22:25.667
I'm pooped.

22:25.734 --> 22:28.934
There must be a reason
why women have babies

22:29.000 --> 22:31.467
when they're twentyish
instead of fortyish.

22:33.367 --> 22:36.900
Blanche, the only thing fortyish
in this room is your hairdo.

22:40.900 --> 22:41.767
Ma.

22:41.834 --> 22:43.367
It's okay. She changed her mind.

22:43.433 --> 22:45.100
Thank God.

22:45.166 --> 22:46.467
I know.

22:46.533 --> 22:47.300
(doorbell rings)

22:47.367 --> 22:49.066
That must be the Lillestrands.

22:49.133 --> 22:52.200
Frank, we love you,
but you're out of here.

22:52.266 --> 22:53.133
Give me a minute.

22:54.333 --> 22:55.000
Sure.

22:58.700 --> 22:59.900
Listen, you.

22:59.967 --> 23:01.734
You're just starting out.

23:01.800 --> 23:03.667
You're in for the long haul.

23:04.166 --> 23:05.700
Keep your seat belt on.

23:05.767 --> 23:07.567
There are lots of twists and turns.

23:08.033 --> 23:11.266
(baby crying)

23:11.333 --> 23:14.000
Stop that,
or they'll come in here and sing again.

23:15.867 --> 23:18.867
(dramatic music playing)

23:24.266 --> 23:27.300
(closing theme music playing)
