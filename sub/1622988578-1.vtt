WEBVTT

02:39.866 --> 02:42.203
Anyone gets curious,
move them along.

02:43.236 --> 02:45.173
We don't want her
drawing a crowd.

02:49.877 --> 02:51.112
Inspector Rees?

02:51.145 --> 02:52.413
Yes?

02:52.445 --> 02:53.713
Sebastian Stubb, of
the London Morning Times.

02:53.747 --> 02:55.183
Ah, yes, of course.

02:55.216 --> 02:56.617
Anything you can
share with our readers

02:56.650 --> 02:57.818
about the incident?

02:57.850 --> 03:01.788
I doubt your readers would
be very interested, Mr.Stubb.

03:01.822 --> 03:03.390
Oh well, with all
due respect sir,

03:03.424 --> 03:05.126
I think I'll be
the judge of that.

03:06.659 --> 03:07.627
Lone woman.

03:07.661 --> 03:08.462
Knife wound.

03:09.864 --> 03:12.633
Probably a robbery gone
awry some time in the night.

03:12.665 --> 03:13.667
Dear, oh dear,
oh dear Inspector,

03:13.700 --> 03:16.471
you'll never make a
headline writer will you?

03:16.503 --> 03:18.840
What about "mysterious assailant

03:18.872 --> 03:24.078
slashes wench-woman's throat
in bloody midnight attack".

03:25.211 --> 03:26.613
That's conjecture.

03:26.646 --> 03:29.382
Time of death is yet
to be established.

03:29.415 --> 03:31.118
All right.

03:31.151 --> 03:34.654
What about "bloody
night time attack" then?

03:34.687 --> 03:36.190
It's reasonable enough.

03:37.591 --> 03:39.159
Now I really must be going.

03:39.926 --> 03:41.895
Oh, can I quote you Inspector?

03:41.929 --> 03:43.631
If you must.

03:51.538 --> 03:53.340
Who told you her
throat was slashed?

03:56.810 --> 03:58.679
Well, it always
pays to be early

03:58.711 --> 04:00.247
on the scene, Inspector.

04:48.995 --> 04:50.830
Morning, Mr Locque.

04:50.863 --> 04:52.832
Inspector Rees sends
his regards, sir.

04:52.865 --> 04:53.700
What else?

04:54.668 --> 04:55.869
Oh, it's a young woman.

04:55.903 --> 04:58.840
Found down the dark end of a
dark alley in the early hours.

05:00.274 --> 05:01.942
No prizes for guessing what
she was up to down there.

05:01.975 --> 05:04.579
Well, we'll find
out shortly, won't we?

05:05.980 --> 05:08.449
There's always a
trace left behind.

05:08.482 --> 05:09.450
Well, that depends,

05:10.384 --> 05:12.687
on whether she swallowed
or spat, doesn't it?

05:14.454 --> 05:16.257
There is always a trace, Dodd.

05:17.257 --> 05:18.692
You would do well
to remember that.

05:20.326 --> 05:22.629
What are they saying
is the cause of death?

05:22.663 --> 05:24.331
Cut throat, sir.

05:24.365 --> 05:25.199
Have a look.

05:37.377 --> 05:39.346
Now, he was saying, it looked
like some fellow had got

05:39.379 --> 05:41.281
what he wanted but
didn't wanna pay.

05:42.548 --> 05:44.618
He probably had a
penknife in his pocket,

05:44.651 --> 05:47.487
there was a scuffle, and
he, er, let her have it.

05:50.057 --> 05:50.891
What?

05:52.492 --> 05:53.627
The penknife.

05:53.661 --> 05:54.461
In the throat, like.

05:56.329 --> 05:58.665
It's a very sharp
penknife if it was.

05:58.699 --> 06:00.401
Yeah well, they
are, aren't they?

06:00.434 --> 06:01.302
Not usually.

06:03.569 --> 06:04.538
Not this sharp.

06:06.673 --> 06:08.308
If a man carries a penknife

06:09.076 --> 06:13.347
he uses it for all sorts
of tasks, sawing rope,

06:13.379 --> 06:15.682
digging stones from
horses' hooves, anything.

06:17.384 --> 06:19.787
The blade ends up
damaged and blunt,

06:19.819 --> 06:23.024
with the result being that
penknife cuts are usually jagged,

06:24.557 --> 06:26.760
with lots of damage to
the surrounding skin.

06:28.362 --> 06:30.898
This one is very clean, it's
made with a good quality blade.

06:32.333 --> 06:33.768
A knife's a knife.

06:33.800 --> 06:35.435
I'm trying to teach
you something here, Dodd.

06:37.370 --> 06:40.040
It would be good if you
could show some ambition

06:40.074 --> 06:41.609
to better yourself.

06:41.641 --> 06:43.310
You don't wanna be pushing
cadavers round in here

06:43.343 --> 06:44.444
all your life.

06:44.478 --> 06:46.079
No, sir.

06:46.112 --> 06:48.048
But I don't wanna be
slicing them up, neither.

06:48.081 --> 06:49.317
Wait!

06:53.786 --> 06:55.923
Death by cut
throat, did you say?

06:55.956 --> 06:57.325
That's what he said, sir.

06:58.091 --> 06:59.326
Then what is that?

07:05.098 --> 07:06.466
Jesus Christ!

07:10.370 --> 07:11.838
Well I shall
tell you one thing,

07:14.841 --> 07:19.413
this was no scuffle over a coin.

07:34.795 --> 07:38.766
It's a bit early,
what are you after?

07:38.798 --> 07:40.668
A quick word with
the lady of the house,

07:40.701 --> 07:41.635
if you'd be so kind.

07:41.668 --> 07:43.370
Miss Levine?

07:43.403 --> 07:44.105
If you'd be so kind.

07:44.137 --> 07:45.605
Well, I'll ask her-

07:45.639 --> 07:48.408
- Tell her it's Ins,

07:48.442 --> 07:50.478
Tell her it's Edmund Rees.

08:04.057 --> 08:05.460
Some tea, Inspector?

08:06.726 --> 08:08.395
That would be very nice.

08:17.838 --> 08:19.039
It's been a long time

08:19.072 --> 08:21.908
since you've darkened
my doorstep, Edmund.

08:23.076 --> 08:24.145
You have a knack of
making every phrase

08:24.177 --> 08:26.079
sound like a
euphemism, Miss Levine.

08:26.112 --> 08:28.449
What, "darkened my doorstep"?

08:29.516 --> 08:30.684
Never heard it called that.

08:30.716 --> 08:33.187
I've heard it called a lot of
things but that's a new one.

08:33.220 --> 08:35.523
Can you guess what
brought me here today?

08:37.624 --> 08:38.926
Yes, I can guess.

08:38.958 --> 08:41.495
So you know what
I'm going to ask?

08:43.563 --> 08:45.665
That girl they
found in the night.

08:45.698 --> 08:47.534
Not far from here wasn't it?

08:47.567 --> 08:48.502
Two streets down.

08:50.136 --> 08:52.038
It's getting more dangerous
by the hour out there.

08:52.072 --> 08:54.073
Can't you do something about it?

08:54.106 --> 08:54.975
Do you know who she was?

08:55.008 --> 08:56.143
I do.

08:56.176 --> 08:58.512
One of the girls from here
was the one that found her.

08:58.544 --> 09:00.814
Came running back and
told me all about it.

09:00.847 --> 09:02.416
I'd like to speak to her.

09:03.216 --> 09:04.751
I don't think she'd
like to speak to you.

09:04.784 --> 09:06.519
You wouldn't have got
past the door if Sally

09:06.552 --> 09:07.455
had known who you were.

09:07.488 --> 09:09.123
Did she recognize the victim?

09:09.155 --> 09:10.524
Yes.

09:10.557 --> 09:14.495
Polly Neilson was
her name, I knew her.

09:14.528 --> 09:16.464
Had she ever
worked here before?

09:16.496 --> 09:19.165
No, but not for
want of trying.

09:19.198 --> 09:21.568
They all come here
onetime or another.

09:21.601 --> 09:24.204
I mean, wouldn't you
rather ply your trade

09:24.238 --> 09:27.108
against a soft pillow
than a cold wall?

09:28.642 --> 09:30.144
But I couldn't help her.

09:30.177 --> 09:31.479
No experience.

09:31.511 --> 09:32.512
So she was knew to it, then?

09:32.546 --> 09:33.948
Oh yes.

09:33.980 --> 09:36.716
Fallen on hard
times, as they say.

09:36.750 --> 09:39.486
She'd been a maid for a
gentleman in a big house.

09:39.519 --> 09:41.754
Very proud of that, she was.

09:41.788 --> 09:43.557
Gave me his card as proof.

09:45.057 --> 09:47.628
Let's see, I've
got it somewhere.

09:50.264 --> 09:54.534
This lady, Polly Neilson, she
was definitely in the trade?

09:55.568 --> 09:56.503
I should say so.

09:57.571 --> 09:59.273
Unless she found some other
way of earning a living

09:59.306 --> 10:01.975
in a dark alleyway in
the middle of the night.

10:02.009 --> 10:04.144
The girl that found her,
she didn't see anything else,

10:04.177 --> 10:06.080
anything suspicious,
somebody running away?

10:06.113 --> 10:07.248
Not that she told me.

10:08.581 --> 10:09.216
Very well.

10:10.616 --> 10:11.951
At least we've got a
name, Polly Neilson.

10:11.985 --> 10:13.086
Not staying for another tea?

10:13.120 --> 10:14.288
Er, no thank you,

10:14.321 --> 10:16.757
it's better if I wasn't seen
spending too much time here.

10:16.789 --> 10:18.592
Oh, shame.

10:20.326 --> 10:22.562
There's nothing better
than something wet

10:22.596 --> 10:24.831
and warm on a cold
day, Inspector.

10:27.301 --> 10:29.637
As my dear late
husband used to say.

10:30.937 --> 10:32.706
I'll see myself out.

11:16.682 --> 11:19.687
I asked upstairs but the
Inspector's out on his rounds.

11:19.720 --> 11:20.555
Never mind.

11:21.688 --> 11:23.957
I'll have more to tell him
by the time he gets back.

11:51.751 --> 11:52.852
Any news?

11:52.885 --> 11:53.687
News?

11:53.720 --> 11:54.822
On the murder.

11:54.855 --> 11:56.356
Everyone's asking about it.

12:02.361 --> 12:05.064
Oh, before you sit down,
sir, that lad from the morgue

12:05.097 --> 12:06.366
came looking for you earlier.

12:06.399 --> 12:09.403
Said the Medical
Examiner wanted a word.

12:24.717 --> 12:26.052
Locque?

12:26.086 --> 12:27.654
Ah, Inspector.

12:27.687 --> 12:28.956
You got my message, I take it?

12:28.989 --> 12:31.992
Er, shame about
the circumstances.

12:32.024 --> 12:33.259
Indeed.

12:33.293 --> 12:34.695
Though I can't think of
any other circumstances

12:34.727 --> 12:36.096
in which we are
ever likely to meet.

12:36.129 --> 12:37.898
A drink some time, perhaps?

12:37.931 --> 12:39.734
Er, no, no thank you, I don't.

12:41.301 --> 12:42.703
So what's this
about the young lady?

12:42.735 --> 12:43.870
Dodd said something
to my colleague

12:43.903 --> 12:45.938
about an abominable injury?

12:45.971 --> 12:46.774
Abdominal.

12:46.807 --> 12:48.075
An abdominal injury.

12:48.107 --> 12:49.208
What sort of thing
are we talking about?

12:49.243 --> 12:51.679
Well, it might be better
if you saw it for yourself.

12:55.782 --> 12:57.317
Christ in heaven!

12:59.820 --> 13:01.689
Dodd had it about right.

13:06.259 --> 13:07.961
What would motivate a man
to do something like this?

13:07.994 --> 13:10.764
It's not for me to delve
into motives, Inspector.

13:11.398 --> 13:13.933
That's your department.

13:13.966 --> 13:16.336
I've never seen
anything like this.

13:16.369 --> 13:17.672
Nor have I.

13:31.518 --> 13:32.720
Elizabeth?

14:09.155 --> 14:11.125
Straight to the
book cabinet, Thomas?

14:12.793 --> 14:15.129
I sometimes wonder if you
care more for those books

14:15.162 --> 14:16.363
than you do for me?

14:16.395 --> 14:20.300
Not at all, I, I just
wanted to return this.

14:21.902 --> 14:24.104
I know you're curious
about my work, Elizabeth,

14:24.136 --> 14:26.239
but it really is no
subject for a lady.

14:26.273 --> 14:28.041
I was bored.

14:28.073 --> 14:30.510
Reading helps to pass the time.

14:30.543 --> 14:32.946
Did you know that the
human tongue is made up

14:32.979 --> 14:36.517
of eight separate
interwoven muscles?

14:36.549 --> 14:38.017
I'm sure there must
be more edifying things

14:38.051 --> 14:39.286
to read about the house.

14:40.821 --> 14:41.822
Or things to do?

14:45.558 --> 14:46.593
Say what you will, Elizabeth.

14:48.427 --> 14:50.898
I'd certainly miss Emily if
we had to do without her.

14:50.931 --> 14:52.399
I'm sure you would.

14:52.432 --> 14:53.834
I meant her cooking.

14:54.600 --> 14:57.403
That was an
excellent roast beef.

14:57.437 --> 15:00.072
It was just missing a
glass of good red wine

15:00.105 --> 15:01.040
to go along with it.

15:02.241 --> 15:05.846
I'll not enter into that
debate with you again, Thomas.

15:05.879 --> 15:07.080
No, I only meant-

15:07.114 --> 15:09.583
- I'll not have any drink in
this house until you've proved

15:09.615 --> 15:12.819
you're capable of controlling
your urge to overindulge.

15:12.852 --> 15:15.221
That was all a long
time ago, Elizabeth.

15:15.254 --> 15:17.825
I told you, I'm
not discussing it.

15:17.857 --> 15:20.560
How can I prove I
can control my urges

15:20.594 --> 15:23.497
when there's nothing in the
house to bloody-well drink!

15:35.075 --> 15:35.910
Well.

15:39.980 --> 15:43.551
I think you've just
proved the very opposite.

17:53.145 --> 17:54.714
Ah, Stubb.

17:54.748 --> 17:57.284
Just been reading your story
in this morning's paper.

17:58.484 --> 18:01.120
I do not appreciate my
name being mentioned.

18:01.153 --> 18:03.557
Well, you said I could
quote you, Inspector.

18:08.560 --> 18:09.462
Well?

18:09.496 --> 18:10.998
What can I do for you this time?

18:12.632 --> 18:16.003
It's more what I can
do for you, Inspector.

18:18.337 --> 18:19.173
What's this?

18:20.272 --> 18:21.140
A confession.

18:23.476 --> 18:25.645
What are you confessing to?

18:25.678 --> 18:26.647
It's not from me!

18:28.114 --> 18:30.985
It's from the
killer of that girl.

18:31.683 --> 18:33.119
Where did you get it from?

18:34.220 --> 18:37.391
It was sent to me
personally, via the newspaper.

18:37.423 --> 18:40.527
Probably some disturbed
person's idea of a joke.

18:40.559 --> 18:42.495
Seems authentic
to me, Inspector.

18:42.528 --> 18:43.364
Let me see it.

18:45.131 --> 18:47.601
I thought we could come to
some kind of an arrangement.

18:47.634 --> 18:48.634
What do you mean?

18:48.669 --> 18:53.740
Well, I've got the
killer's side of the story.

18:54.606 --> 18:55.675
I just need the copper's.

18:57.210 --> 18:58.711
I'd make it a big
two-parter, you know,

18:58.744 --> 19:00.579
front page with a
big illustration

19:00.613 --> 19:01.815
of the killer
standing over the body

19:01.847 --> 19:02.615
with a knife in his hand and-

19:02.648 --> 19:05.718
- Just give me
the bloody letter.

19:13.660 --> 19:17.064
Red ink, seems like a gimmick.

19:17.096 --> 19:18.298
Well, it wouldn't
be the first time

19:18.330 --> 19:19.799
that a killer's been
attracted to the idea

19:19.833 --> 19:22.335
of gaining notoriety
now Inspector, would it?

19:22.367 --> 19:25.105
And that would explain
why he send it directly

19:25.137 --> 19:27.441
to a newspaper, as
opposed to yourself.

19:29.142 --> 19:33.747
Oh, and, er, he's given
himself a little trade name.

19:34.847 --> 19:36.115
"Jack the Ripper".

19:37.517 --> 19:40.086
It's good, isn't it?

19:40.119 --> 19:42.588
Better than anything I
could've ever come up with.

19:44.156 --> 19:47.427
Oh, and, er, he goes over
everything he did to that girl,

19:49.162 --> 19:50.163
in great detail.

19:57.170 --> 19:58.839
This is obscene.

19:58.872 --> 20:02.076
If you publish any of
this, you're a damn fool.

20:18.157 --> 20:20.259
Report on Polly
Neilson, is it ready?

20:20.292 --> 20:21.894
Yes, I finished
with her yesterday,

20:21.928 --> 20:24.231
the report's been sat
on my desk all night.

20:24.263 --> 20:26.365
Just give me the highlights,
I need to check on something.

20:26.398 --> 20:28.667
Well, the cause of death,
as you correctly surmised,

20:28.701 --> 20:32.139
was two deep cuts to the
throat, one of which completely

20:32.172 --> 20:35.909
severed all of the tissue
down to the vertebrae.

20:35.942 --> 20:38.144
That's the spinal
column, Inspector.

20:38.178 --> 20:39.579
What about the other injuries?

20:39.612 --> 20:41.715
Well, there are
several small stab wounds

20:41.748 --> 20:43.250
and two very deep ones,

20:43.282 --> 20:46.152
one particularly so leading
to a breach of the bowel.

20:46.185 --> 20:47.787
And a very large
concentration of damage

20:47.819 --> 20:49.655
to the interior of the abdomen.

20:51.457 --> 20:54.928
When you say the, er, abdomen.

20:54.961 --> 20:55.929
Yes?

20:55.961 --> 20:57.530
A gentleman has an abdomen,

20:57.564 --> 21:00.432
but a gentleman
doesn't have a, er-

21:00.465 --> 21:02.334
- The injuries are
specific to that part

21:02.367 --> 21:05.237
of a woman's abdomen
which differentiates

21:05.270 --> 21:06.472
it to that of a gentleman's.

21:09.375 --> 21:12.878
I made fully detailed
notes, in my report.

21:12.912 --> 21:14.013
No, leave that here.

21:14.047 --> 21:16.516
I want to keep the details
of this between ourselves

21:16.548 --> 21:18.250
at the moment.

21:18.284 --> 21:20.187
This type of crime tends to
attract a lot of attention.

21:20.220 --> 21:22.355
I've already had a reporter
in my office this morning.

21:22.387 --> 21:23.222
I understand.

21:24.990 --> 21:27.227
Funny thing is
he had this letter,

21:27.259 --> 21:29.261
supposedly from the killer.

21:29.295 --> 21:30.864
Yes?

21:30.896 --> 21:33.299
Thought it was a lot of
nonsense, a silly practical joke,

21:33.333 --> 21:36.202
but the description of
the injuries was bang on.

21:36.236 --> 21:37.938
A lot of people could
have seen the body

21:37.971 --> 21:39.306
before you got there.

21:39.338 --> 21:40.906
Even the internal wounds?

21:42.375 --> 21:44.477
Sorry, sir, but it's urgent.

21:44.509 --> 21:45.444
What is it?

21:45.478 --> 21:47.314
They've found another one.

21:47.346 --> 21:48.615
Another what?

21:48.647 --> 21:49.682
A girl, sir.

21:54.988 --> 21:58.325
Keep a close guard on her
'till the carriage gets here.

21:58.357 --> 21:59.592
I don't want anybody
touching the body

21:59.625 --> 22:01.461
till we get it to
the medical examiner.

22:02.662 --> 22:04.798
Her name was Mary Anne Keates.

22:05.932 --> 22:08.268
You seem very well
informed, Stubb.

22:08.300 --> 22:10.336
I just ask around,
Inspector, that's all.

22:10.369 --> 22:12.338
Thought you might have
read it in a letter.

22:12.372 --> 22:14.975
You never know,
Inspector, you never know.

22:15.008 --> 22:17.711
But, if I do get another one,

22:19.912 --> 22:21.014
you'll be the first to know.

22:21.047 --> 22:22.716
I will?

22:22.749 --> 22:27.520
You will, if we can come
to some kind of arrangement.

22:29.521 --> 22:31.991
Otherwise, like everyone else,

22:32.025 --> 22:34.594
you can read it on the front
page of the Morning Times.

22:41.768 --> 22:43.336
Have a care, Dodd.

22:43.368 --> 22:44.471
What's the matter?

22:44.503 --> 22:46.372
She's dead, isn't she?

22:46.405 --> 22:49.308
She ain't gonna be
complaining about the service.

22:49.342 --> 22:54.314
I have to accurately
ascertain the cause of death.

22:55.580 --> 22:57.384
If you throw her from the
trolley and break her neck,

22:58.651 --> 23:01.454
how will I know if the damage
was done pre or post-mortem?

23:01.487 --> 23:03.856
Yeah, well, the, er,
cause of death's no mystery

23:03.890 --> 23:04.725
with this one.

23:16.868 --> 23:18.437
It's a cut throat once again.

23:21.374 --> 23:22.907
Yeah.

23:22.909 --> 23:24.076
And the rest.

23:24.109 --> 23:25.611
You've already examined her?

23:26.479 --> 23:28.581
I had a good look, yeah.

23:28.614 --> 23:30.083
When I took her dress off.

23:30.115 --> 23:32.751
So, you're finally taking
an interest in your work?

23:32.785 --> 23:33.920
Only the pretty ones.

23:35.121 --> 23:37.791
So she's the same
as the previous one?

23:37.824 --> 23:38.659
No.

23:39.726 --> 23:40.627
She's worse.

23:57.042 --> 23:58.377
Miss Levine, please, now.

24:04.450 --> 24:06.720
Not that I don't appreciate
your visits, Edmund,

24:06.752 --> 24:10.723
but you could try to be
a bit more circumspect.

24:10.757 --> 24:13.125
Almost knocking the door
down in broad daylight?

24:13.159 --> 24:15.662
This is a very serious matter.

24:36.481 --> 24:38.084
It's become apparent
that the murders

24:38.116 --> 24:40.019
have a particular edge to them.

24:41.721 --> 24:46.125
The, er, perpetrator seems to
be taking a certain pleasure

24:46.159 --> 24:47.826
in the act of violence.

24:47.859 --> 24:50.462
And what light are you
expected me to shed on this?

24:50.496 --> 24:52.799
Well it's occurred to
me you might have acquired

24:52.832 --> 24:55.502
a substantial knowledge,
over the years,

24:55.535 --> 24:58.438
of the preferences
of a large number

24:58.471 --> 25:01.375
of the gentlemen in the area.

25:02.575 --> 25:05.412
Do any of your regulars like
to get rough with girls?

25:05.444 --> 25:07.413
Hit them, cut them,
that sort of thing?

25:07.446 --> 25:08.647
It happens.

25:08.681 --> 25:09.749
But they don't stay
regulars very long

25:09.781 --> 25:11.518
once I get to hear about it.

25:11.550 --> 25:13.051
To be frank, Inspector,

25:13.085 --> 25:15.188
it's far more common
the other way round.

25:15.221 --> 25:16.522
The other way round?

25:16.556 --> 25:17.824
Oh yes, there's plenty of them

25:17.856 --> 25:20.527
that come here for
a bit of abuse.

25:20.559 --> 25:22.428
Doctors, lawyers, judges.

25:23.162 --> 25:25.432
We've got a special room for it.

25:25.464 --> 25:26.500
Would you like to see it?

25:43.482 --> 25:46.152
I'm sorry I can't help
you any further, Edmund.

25:46.184 --> 25:48.086
You mentioned a
gentleman's card

25:48.119 --> 25:49.488
you were gonna give me.

25:49.521 --> 25:52.491
Yes, I'm sure
it's here somewhere.

25:57.563 --> 25:59.199
Never mind, I'm
sure it'll show up.

26:00.532 --> 26:02.501
There was one other
thing, Inspector.

26:02.535 --> 26:05.004
Some awful man came knocking
on the door this morning

26:05.037 --> 26:07.841
claiming to be from the
Whitechapel Vigilance Committee.

26:14.279 --> 26:16.215
Accused me of living
off immoral earnings.

26:16.249 --> 26:18.218
He's not entirely
inaccurate then, is he?

26:18.250 --> 26:20.487
You know this building's
all my dear late husband

26:20.519 --> 26:24.190
left me with to eke out a
living in my autumn years.

26:27.792 --> 26:29.695
Remind me, what
did he die of again?

26:31.631 --> 26:32.532
Misbehavior.

26:35.300 --> 26:37.569
There seems to be
a lot of it about.

26:49.949 --> 26:51.551
Inspector Rees?

26:51.584 --> 26:53.119
Yes.

26:53.152 --> 26:54.653
What can I do for you?

26:54.686 --> 26:56.155
I suppose you've seen this?

26:57.323 --> 26:58.791
The newspaper?

26:58.824 --> 26:59.826
This!

26:59.858 --> 27:01.627
These appalling murders.

27:01.661 --> 27:02.496
Murders?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.198
The newspaper
only mentions one.

27:05.230 --> 27:07.534
I heard from my carriage
driver on the way here

27:07.567 --> 27:09.301
that a second body
had been discovered.

27:09.335 --> 27:11.004
Word travels fast.

27:11.037 --> 27:13.539
Yes, a lot faster than you
it would seem, Inspector.

27:14.205 --> 27:15.173
Excuse me, sir, may I ask-

27:15.207 --> 27:17.110
- Doctor George Lowry.

27:17.143 --> 27:19.546
Head of the Whitechapel
Vigilance Committee.

27:21.646 --> 27:23.582
It's simply not good
enough, Inspector.

27:25.250 --> 27:27.854
I've been a resident of
Whitechapel for over 60 years,

27:27.886 --> 27:29.655
man and boy.

27:29.689 --> 27:31.557
Ran a highly regarded
medical practice

27:31.590 --> 27:33.092
until my retirement last year.

27:34.594 --> 27:38.163
This used to be a decent,
God-fearing community.

27:39.832 --> 27:41.167
Now look at it.

27:42.734 --> 27:44.303
Once can scarce set foot
outside one's own front

27:44.336 --> 27:47.240
door without being accosted
by some filthy rag-seller.

27:48.607 --> 27:53.078
Or being propositioned by,
well, by the likes of this girl.

27:55.381 --> 27:57.250
And as if that wasn't enough,

27:58.651 --> 28:02.288
now we have some foreign
butcher committing acts

28:02.320 --> 28:03.255
of such atrocity-

28:03.288 --> 28:04.691
- Foreign butcher?

28:04.723 --> 28:05.925
Well, wouldn't you
say so, Inspector?

28:07.027 --> 28:11.364
I can't imagine a true
Englishman sinking to the level

28:11.396 --> 28:13.732
of such depravity.

28:14.933 --> 28:18.104
Do your job properly, Inspector,
and I am sure you will find

28:18.136 --> 28:23.143
the dark hand of some
Persian or an Oriental

28:24.874 --> 28:25.345
is behind all this.

28:25.377 --> 28:28.347
Be that as it may, there has
indeed been a second murder.

28:29.714 --> 28:31.951
So my next step is to
establish what connects

28:31.983 --> 28:33.619
the two events-

28:33.653 --> 28:36.655
- Spare me the procedural
recitation, Inspector.

28:36.689 --> 28:38.858
The Whitechapel Vigilance
Committee are well-versed

28:38.891 --> 28:41.728
in matters of law and order.

28:41.760 --> 28:44.064
Some of our members
are retired judges.

28:45.730 --> 28:48.835
Our patron is none other than
your very own Chief Inspector.

28:52.137 --> 28:53.005
Answer me this,

28:54.440 --> 28:57.677
do you have any suspect
in mind for these crimes?

28:58.743 --> 28:59.811
No.

28:59.845 --> 29:01.381
Then what the devil are
you doing sat behind a desk

29:01.413 --> 29:02.816
talking to me?

29:03.816 --> 29:04.884
Get out there, man.

29:06.152 --> 29:09.689
Do your job, knock
on some doors.

29:09.721 --> 29:11.691
I can list you a dozen streets

29:11.723 --> 29:14.394
where you will
find meat vendors,

29:14.426 --> 29:18.063
and animal slaughterers,
and tanners.

29:19.898 --> 29:22.334
And not one of
them an Englishman.

29:22.367 --> 29:25.904
Thank you, Dr Lowry,
that won't be necessary.

29:25.938 --> 29:28.708
And if you do nothing else,

29:28.740 --> 29:30.442
can you not, at the very least,

29:30.476 --> 29:33.647
put an end to these
frightful newspaper stories?

29:34.446 --> 29:35.814
It's bad enough.

29:36.749 --> 29:39.184
We have a murderer
on our streets

29:39.218 --> 29:42.255
without the gruesome
details being spread far

29:42.288 --> 29:44.790
and wide for the general
populace to gossip about.

29:46.959 --> 29:48.928
I will not have the good name

29:48.961 --> 29:52.832
of Whitechapel
besmirched any further.

29:55.468 --> 29:57.003
Good day to you, inspector.

30:10.516 --> 30:11.750
Elizabeth?

30:11.784 --> 30:13.787
In here.

30:16.288 --> 30:17.190
What's all this?

30:17.222 --> 30:19.759
I've made your dinner, Thomas.

30:19.791 --> 30:21.293
You have?

30:21.326 --> 30:22.795
What about Emily?

30:22.827 --> 30:24.730
Is it such a surprise?

30:24.763 --> 30:27.132
I'm perfectly capable, Thomas.

30:27.165 --> 30:29.068
Remember when we
were first married?

30:30.102 --> 30:31.871
There were no housemaids then.

30:32.505 --> 30:33.840
I remember it well.

30:35.106 --> 30:37.844
Wine, that is a surprise.

30:39.044 --> 30:41.381
I felt badly about
what I said yesterday.

30:43.281 --> 30:45.183
Don't let your meal get cold.

30:45.217 --> 30:46.152
Are you not joining me?

30:46.184 --> 30:47.819
I had something earlier.

30:47.853 --> 30:49.722
This is all about you.

30:50.890 --> 30:52.792
I made your favorite.

30:53.858 --> 30:54.793
Steak and kidney.

31:06.471 --> 31:09.075
Mmm, it's excellent, Elizabeth.

31:18.183 --> 31:22.855
You know, Thomas, wine
isn't the only thing

31:22.887 --> 31:24.757
we've gone without
these past years.

31:27.992 --> 31:32.365
Perhaps tonight could be
something of a, a new beginning?

31:43.608 --> 31:47.145
There, I knew we
could do without.

31:47.179 --> 31:48.881
Without what?

31:48.913 --> 31:50.048
Without Emily.

31:50.082 --> 31:51.818
Well, for a night, yes.

31:51.851 --> 31:52.985
Did you give her the day off?

31:53.018 --> 31:54.788
I gave her every day off.

31:56.488 --> 32:00.092
I told her to seek a new
position with immediate effect.

32:00.125 --> 32:01.193
You did what?

32:02.493 --> 32:04.230
Don't make a fuss, Thomas.

32:04.262 --> 32:05.097
Make a fuss?

32:07.165 --> 32:08.533
I'm the head of this
household, Elizabeth.

32:08.567 --> 32:09.935
You should have consulted me

32:09.969 --> 32:10.536
before making a
decision like that.

32:10.568 --> 32:12.471
Head of the household?

32:12.503 --> 32:14.940
But I'm the one who's here
all the time, you're not.

32:14.973 --> 32:16.907
No, Elizabeth.

32:16.909 --> 32:17.844
I'll not have this.

32:19.545 --> 32:21.913
You must find her
and ask her back.

32:21.946 --> 32:23.549
With an apology if necessary.

32:24.950 --> 32:28.955
You'd have your own
wife go begging to a maid?

32:30.355 --> 32:32.325
Well I'm sure that won't
be necessary, I just-

32:32.357 --> 32:35.828
- I wonder which one of us
is more important to you?

32:36.528 --> 32:37.864
What's that supposed to mean?

32:37.896 --> 32:40.232
You've a wandering
eye, Thomas.

32:40.266 --> 32:42.902
Don't think I haven't noticed.

32:42.934 --> 32:44.903
I've never laid
a hand on Emily!

32:47.906 --> 32:49.008
I'd know if you had.

32:50.675 --> 32:51.577
Believe me.

32:56.648 --> 32:57.916
I know you.

32:58.951 --> 33:01.220
Perhaps better than you think,

33:06.525 --> 33:08.326
remember that.

34:01.079 --> 34:02.648
Have you seen this?

34:04.083 --> 34:06.285
Stubb's published another
letter from the Ripper.

34:06.317 --> 34:08.353
Details of the case
I didn't even know.

34:09.755 --> 34:11.724
There's got to be something
we can charge him with.

34:11.757 --> 34:13.358
Aiding and abetting, sir?

34:13.391 --> 34:14.559
That's going a bit far.

34:14.592 --> 34:16.194
As far as we know at the moment.

34:17.329 --> 34:18.965
Our friend Dr Lowry's
not gonna be happy

34:18.998 --> 34:21.166
when he sees this, and
he claims to have the ear

34:21.199 --> 34:22.500
of the Chief Inspector.

34:22.534 --> 34:23.936
I wouldn't worry, sir.

34:25.103 --> 34:27.372
Chief Inspector's out
of town, family wedding.

34:45.090 --> 34:47.360
Come on, Locque,
where are you?

35:05.244 --> 35:07.012
Inspector?

35:07.045 --> 35:08.547
I was just, er-

35:08.579 --> 35:10.715
- We don't leave cadavers
out over night, Inspector.

35:10.748 --> 35:12.617
But you do leave
the door unlocked?

35:15.054 --> 35:15.655
Not usually.

35:16.822 --> 35:19.191
I was running a bit
late this morning.

35:19.224 --> 35:22.061
Perhaps it was Dodd,
he has the other key.

35:22.094 --> 35:23.596
What can I do for
you, Inspector?

35:23.628 --> 35:25.331
Report on the
second Ripper victim,

35:25.364 --> 35:26.164
is it ready yet?

35:26.197 --> 35:27.699
Yes, it's on my desk.

35:27.733 --> 35:28.735
I couldn't see it.

35:34.172 --> 35:36.174
Never mind, just give
me the highlights.

35:37.309 --> 35:38.377
Are the injuries
the same as before?

35:38.409 --> 35:39.577
More or less.

35:39.610 --> 35:40.578
Would you say it's
the same killer?

35:40.612 --> 35:41.813
Most definitely.

35:41.847 --> 35:45.151
The chances of there being two
different murderers operating

35:45.184 --> 35:48.653
in such a manner at the same
time would be infinitesimal.

35:48.686 --> 35:50.722
Was there anything
missing from the victim?

35:52.090 --> 35:53.291
A kidney.

35:53.324 --> 35:54.559
Completely removed.

35:56.795 --> 35:59.130
But you knew that, didn't you?

35:59.164 --> 36:00.066
How?

36:00.099 --> 36:01.167
This morning's paper.

36:01.833 --> 36:03.168
That's impossible.

36:03.202 --> 36:05.671
Published another
letter from the Ripper.

36:05.704 --> 36:08.074
What was done to the
girl's body in detail.

36:10.509 --> 36:11.577
Well that settles it.

36:12.878 --> 36:17.682
The letters are real, and
so is Jack the Ripper.

36:22.320 --> 36:25.324
Sorry sir, I thought
you'd wanna know right away.

36:25.356 --> 36:27.092
They've found another body.

36:27.126 --> 36:28.327
Looks like our man again.

36:42.507 --> 36:45.744
Be nice to go just one day
without finding another body.

36:50.916 --> 36:52.218
It's Stubb!

36:54.186 --> 36:55.688
I'd like a word with him.

37:23.815 --> 37:26.251
I imagine you know which
case you've been invited in

37:26.284 --> 37:27.385
to share you knowledge of?

37:27.418 --> 37:28.853
Invited to share my knowledge?

37:28.887 --> 37:30.856
Yeah well, that's a fine way
to put it, Inspector, isn't it?

37:30.889 --> 37:32.691
I'm learning from you, Stubb.

37:32.724 --> 37:33.826
I'm an innocent
man, Inspector.

37:33.858 --> 37:35.260
Why did you run?

37:35.293 --> 37:37.228
I've not even been
charged with anything.

37:37.262 --> 37:39.198
Allow me to remedy
that situation.

37:40.599 --> 37:42.668
Unless you start talking you'll
be charged with the murders

37:42.701 --> 37:46.472
of Polly Neilson, Annie
Chaplin and quite possibly

37:46.505 --> 37:47.907
the young girl that
was found this morning.

37:47.940 --> 37:49.175
Murders?

37:51.443 --> 37:53.612
I, I thought you were
gonna charge me with-

37:53.644 --> 37:54.480
- With what?

37:58.282 --> 37:59.717
Nothing.

37:59.751 --> 38:01.921
Nothing, I, er, I misspoke.

38:03.322 --> 38:04.624
Why don't you try again?

38:08.960 --> 38:10.161
I don't know nothing
about those murders.

38:10.195 --> 38:15.233
On the contrary, Mr Stubb,
you seem to know an awful lot.

38:15.266 --> 38:16.601
Rather too much, as it happens.

38:17.702 --> 38:20.239
Intimate, detailed
knowledge of the wounds

38:20.271 --> 38:23.442
to each victim's body,
that you didn't get from me

38:23.474 --> 38:25.510
or anybody else in
this department.

38:25.543 --> 38:27.679
Well those details were
in the letters, Inspector.

38:27.713 --> 38:31.517
Oh yes, the famous
Ripper Letters.

38:31.550 --> 38:33.986
In blood red ink, no less.

38:34.018 --> 38:36.421
You said yourself that they
were authentic, Inspector.

38:36.454 --> 38:38.990
I said the information
in them was authentic,

38:39.023 --> 38:40.358
not the writer.

38:41.659 --> 38:43.761
And it seems to me
that you, Stubb,

38:43.795 --> 38:45.731
personally have done rather well

38:45.764 --> 38:49.202
out of this whole,
nasty business.

38:52.471 --> 38:53.072
Search his bag.

38:54.739 --> 38:56.241
You've no right to do that.

38:56.275 --> 38:57.677
Something to hide in there?

38:58.643 --> 39:00.346
The murder weapon perhaps?

39:01.346 --> 39:02.681
Of course not.

39:04.349 --> 39:07.286
Looks like a
packet of notepaper.

39:09.987 --> 39:11.088
And an ink pen.

39:11.123 --> 39:13.492
Of course I've got an ink
pen, I'm a writer aren't I?

39:18.929 --> 39:21.833
Simpson's Best
Quality Writing Ink.

39:23.335 --> 39:24.336
Scarlet Red.

39:29.940 --> 39:34.545
I wonder, Mr Stubb, if we took
a sample of your handwriting

39:34.579 --> 39:36.716
and compared it to one
of these Ripper letters,

39:37.882 --> 39:39.417
what conclusion
we might come to?

39:47.092 --> 39:48.360
You got a light?

39:49.927 --> 39:50.762
No.

40:08.112 --> 40:09.414
All right.

40:09.447 --> 40:10.382
I did the letters.

40:10.416 --> 40:13.952
It was just a bit of
showmanship, you know?

40:13.985 --> 40:17.021
And er, well, I didn't think
it would cause any harm.

40:17.054 --> 40:18.089
And the murders?

40:18.123 --> 40:19.692
No.

40:19.724 --> 40:21.360
No, I ain't nothing to
do with those murders.

40:21.393 --> 40:24.396
Then how did you know what
to write in those letters?

40:24.429 --> 40:27.465
Every knife slash, every cut.

40:27.498 --> 40:29.934
Every detail of
those girls' bodies.

40:44.548 --> 40:47.820
Well sir, this one's
in a right state.

40:49.387 --> 40:50.588
Why does he do it, do you think?

40:50.621 --> 40:52.657
It's not for us to divine why.

40:52.690 --> 40:55.427
Yeah but, you must wonder.

40:56.862 --> 40:58.797
I mean, everyone's
talking about it,

40:58.829 --> 41:00.898
it's all Ripper this
and Ripper that.

41:00.931 --> 41:02.534
I have to keep my head down.

41:03.934 --> 41:06.904
If anyone knew I'd had my
hands all over his victims...

41:06.938 --> 41:10.376
The second victim, do you
know where my report is?

41:13.077 --> 41:15.380
It'll be on your
desk, won't it?

41:15.414 --> 41:16.749
It isn't.

41:16.782 --> 41:18.517
But I'm sure it was last night.

41:22.721 --> 41:24.590
You probably took it home.

41:26.490 --> 41:27.659
Now why would I do that?

41:32.496 --> 41:34.866
Are you sure you don't
know where it is?

41:39.603 --> 41:41.973
Put yourself in
my position, Stubb.

41:43.974 --> 41:45.911
I'm under a lot of
pressure to nab somebody

41:45.943 --> 41:50.516
for these murders, thanks
to your bloody newspaper.

41:52.217 --> 41:55.421
You're the first to the
scene of every crime,

41:56.621 --> 41:59.157
you've got in-depth
knowledge of the killings,

41:59.190 --> 42:02.894
and you, personally
stand to benefit

42:02.927 --> 42:05.963
from each and every murder,

42:05.996 --> 42:08.500
the more shocking and
perverted the better.

42:10.869 --> 42:14.539
Give me one damn reason
why I shouldn't throw you

42:14.572 --> 42:16.841
in the cells this very minute?

42:23.648 --> 42:25.017
Locque?

42:25.050 --> 42:26.518
I'm in the middle of something!

42:26.550 --> 42:27.152
I know.

42:27.184 --> 42:28.453
That is why I came.

42:31.789 --> 42:32.625
Tell him, Dodd.

42:36.161 --> 42:37.528
He got 'em from me.

42:37.561 --> 42:38.596
What?

42:40.998 --> 42:43.201
The medical reports
on the bodies.

42:43.235 --> 42:45.838
He's been taking
them from my desk,

42:45.871 --> 42:48.773
copying them out and then
returning them the next morning.

42:49.974 --> 42:52.577
And the copies went
to your friend, there,

42:52.610 --> 42:54.078
from the newspaper.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.583
Are you sure of this?

42:57.615 --> 43:00.219
This morning he
forgot to put them back.

43:00.251 --> 43:03.255
And I imagine you
paid a pretty penny for them?

43:03.288 --> 43:05.090
It's not a crime to
report the true facts

43:05.123 --> 43:06.525
of a case, is it?

43:06.557 --> 43:08.527
Why didn't you just
bloody-well say so?

43:09.661 --> 43:11.130
I'm a journalist, Inspector.

43:12.030 --> 43:13.499
I have to protect my sources.

43:15.733 --> 43:17.502
Take 'em away.

43:30.081 --> 43:31.851
It's been a long day.

43:33.117 --> 43:35.621
Join me for a drink,
why don't you?

43:35.653 --> 43:36.554
I, um-

43:36.588 --> 43:38.257
- Come on, it's not six o'clock.

43:38.289 --> 43:40.259
You can spare me ten minutes.

43:40.291 --> 43:43.228
I cant stay too long, my wife-

43:43.260 --> 43:44.663
- Keeps you on your
toes, does she?

43:44.695 --> 43:46.632
You could say that.

43:46.664 --> 43:47.699
Still, cheers.

43:49.867 --> 43:52.203
It's worth it, I imagine.

43:52.237 --> 43:53.271
You're not married?

43:53.304 --> 43:56.641
No, never found the time.

43:56.675 --> 43:59.144
Must have spent too much
of it behind that desk.

44:01.646 --> 44:02.714
Thomas.

44:02.746 --> 44:04.082
It is Thomas, isn't it?

44:05.784 --> 44:07.586
Yes, my work does come first.

44:07.619 --> 44:09.755
I imagine you're
under a lot of pressure.

44:10.889 --> 44:11.957
It's not the
external pressure,

44:11.989 --> 44:13.558
it's what's in here, Thomas.

44:16.293 --> 44:19.297
I take it personally,
whatever happens on my patch,

44:19.331 --> 44:23.936
and whoever the victim is, be
it, lord, lady or gentleman.

44:24.902 --> 44:25.737
Or whore.

44:27.706 --> 44:29.208
They all deserve justice.

44:32.043 --> 44:34.646
Now, about the Ripper-

44:34.679 --> 44:35.981
- Isn't that just
a name your friend

44:36.014 --> 44:38.050
from the newspaper conjured up?

44:38.083 --> 44:38.918
It is.

44:40.117 --> 44:41.286
But I've a feeling
it's gonna stick,

44:41.318 --> 44:42.954
it seems quite fitting.

44:42.987 --> 44:44.056
Not entirely.

44:44.088 --> 44:45.257
Oh?

44:45.289 --> 44:46.692
What's your take on it, then?

44:46.724 --> 44:48.293
Everything I know
is in my reports.

44:48.326 --> 44:49.728
Yes.

44:49.760 --> 44:51.697
I'm not interested
in what you know.

44:53.164 --> 44:55.367
I'm interested in
what you think.

44:55.400 --> 44:58.704
I don't follow you?

44:58.737 --> 45:00.706
You're more intimately
acquainted with the injuries

45:00.739 --> 45:02.307
to these girls'
bodies than anybody.

45:03.307 --> 45:04.876
Anybody but the killer himself.

45:07.244 --> 45:10.214
You might have some thoughts,
some suspicions, anything.

45:10.248 --> 45:14.353
I mean, what could make a
man do something like this?

45:14.385 --> 45:16.721
A suspicion doesn't
constitute evidence, Edmund.

45:16.755 --> 45:17.690
I might help.

45:19.123 --> 45:21.059
It might throw some
light on something.

45:22.693 --> 45:25.831
For instance, what
weapon is responsible

45:25.864 --> 45:27.065
for these injuries?

45:27.097 --> 45:28.400
It's in my report,
a precision blade.

45:28.432 --> 45:30.268
What does that mean?

45:30.300 --> 45:31.103
A butcher's knife?

45:31.135 --> 45:32.371
No.

45:32.403 --> 45:35.273
No, no, something much
sharper, more precise.

45:36.340 --> 45:37.907
A craftsman's blade, perhaps.

45:37.909 --> 45:39.010
A surgeon's scalpel.

45:40.679 --> 45:41.713
Possibly, yes.

45:45.215 --> 45:46.652
On the recommendation
of Dr Lowry,

45:46.684 --> 45:48.887
we've got people out
interviewing every butcher

45:48.920 --> 45:50.956
and slaughter man
in the district.

45:50.989 --> 45:52.657
Are we wasting our time?

45:52.690 --> 45:54.659
I would say so, yes.

45:54.693 --> 45:57.663
The killer's no
butcher, he's precise.

45:58.762 --> 46:01.366
And with a knowledge
of the human anatomy.

46:02.733 --> 46:05.403
That missing kidney
was expertly removed.

46:05.436 --> 46:06.771
An educated man?

46:06.804 --> 46:07.772
Almost certainly.

46:07.806 --> 46:08.740
A man of means?

46:08.773 --> 46:09.807
Possibly.

46:10.809 --> 46:12.377
So robbery isn't
his motive, then?

46:12.409 --> 46:16.347
Without a doubt, his motive
is something much darker.

46:20.452 --> 46:23.722
The location and savagery
of the injuries suggest

46:23.755 --> 46:28.059
he takes an abnormal pleasure
in the act of violence.

46:31.730 --> 46:33.132
A prurient pleasure if you like.

46:38.036 --> 46:40.204
There's no shortage of
suspects then, is there?

46:40.237 --> 46:41.205
What do you mean?

46:44.909 --> 46:46.378
It's all around us, Thomas.

46:48.346 --> 46:52.751
In every Penny Dreadful
novel in every corner shop.

46:52.784 --> 46:55.788
The more gruesome the murders
the more the public lap it up.

46:57.789 --> 46:59.958
Did you know, householders
in the vicinity

46:59.990 --> 47:02.460
of every murder scene are
renting out their upstairs rooms

47:02.494 --> 47:04.829
for people desperate
to catch a glimpse

47:04.862 --> 47:08.266
of where a Ripper
victim met their demise.

47:11.436 --> 47:13.171
I truly believe it's
something buried deep

47:13.204 --> 47:15.106
inside of us, Thomas.

47:15.139 --> 47:17.375
This desire for violence.

47:17.407 --> 47:18.576
In all of us?

47:18.608 --> 47:21.913
If I could get my hands on
the bastard that's behind this.

47:24.516 --> 47:28.153
What do you think might
release it, this buried desire?

47:29.853 --> 47:32.890
Could be anything,
I mean, drink, lust.

47:32.923 --> 47:36.527
Do you think it's possible
that the killer himself might

47:36.561 --> 47:38.797
be unaware of his actions?

47:38.829 --> 47:39.465
Unaware?

47:41.498 --> 47:42.399
Of crimes so heinous?

47:42.434 --> 47:44.236
Well, if excessive
drink were involved,

47:44.268 --> 47:46.137
in a drunken state many
a man have committed acts

47:46.170 --> 47:48.072
that they would
normally find abhorrent.

47:48.106 --> 47:50.509
Almost sounds as if you're
making excuses for him.

47:52.277 --> 47:54.045
No, no not at all.

47:54.077 --> 47:54.880
Another?

47:54.913 --> 47:56.481
If you don't mind.

48:01.920 --> 48:05.257
So, we've established the
type of man we're looking for.

48:06.590 --> 48:09.193
An educated man, a
gentleman, quite possibly

48:09.226 --> 48:10.228
some knowledge of surgery.

48:10.260 --> 48:11.896
Yes.

48:11.929 --> 48:14.398
What about his truly
defining characteristics?

48:14.431 --> 48:15.800
Well, what do you mean?

48:16.835 --> 48:18.503
Simply having
access to scalpel

48:19.903 --> 48:21.306
doesn't make one a murderer.

48:22.907 --> 48:27.077
I mean, what makes
a man commit acts

48:27.110 --> 48:29.413
of such appalling degeneracy?

48:29.447 --> 48:31.916
How can you hope to know
that from the evidence in hand?

48:31.949 --> 48:32.917
Think, damn it!

48:39.623 --> 48:43.427
Well, there was one thing
that struck me as odd.

48:45.630 --> 48:47.999
I didn't mention
it in my reports

48:48.032 --> 48:50.202
'cause I wasn't exactly
sure how to phrase it.

48:52.469 --> 48:57.475
The way in which the wounds
are inflicted is inconsistent.

48:59.878 --> 49:00.979
So you think there's
more than one of them?

49:01.012 --> 49:03.949
No, not between the killings,

49:03.981 --> 49:06.985
I mean each one is inconsistent.

49:07.018 --> 49:09.588
The initial attacks,
the throat slash

49:09.621 --> 49:11.289
and the abdominal stabbings,

49:12.891 --> 49:14.526
it's all done very fast and
with considerable force.

49:14.559 --> 49:16.061
In the heat of
passion, you might say?

49:16.094 --> 49:19.463
You might, yes, but
then the internal wounds,

49:20.565 --> 49:24.001
the organ removal,
this was done carefully

49:24.034 --> 49:29.007
and with precision, almost as
if by another hand entirely.

49:30.173 --> 49:32.277
So you do think there's
more than one of them?

49:32.309 --> 49:33.210
No, no, no,

49:33.244 --> 49:34.112
I was speaking figuratively.

49:35.079 --> 49:37.883
It's clearly the same
blade, I just wondered.

49:39.250 --> 49:43.454
Does this provide any clue as
to the killer's intentions?

49:46.190 --> 49:47.092
The murders are
committed very fast-

49:47.125 --> 49:49.193
- Not just fast, frenzied.

49:50.594 --> 49:53.998
Once the victim is dead, a
different motivation takes over

49:54.032 --> 49:56.934
a more careful, planned act.

49:58.402 --> 49:59.237
But why?

50:05.710 --> 50:07.579
To send a message.

50:10.114 --> 50:14.385
To who?

50:14.418 --> 50:15.253
To us.

50:22.726 --> 50:23.961
The time!

50:23.994 --> 50:26.030
Sorry, Thomas, I've kept you.

50:26.063 --> 50:28.000
Don't concern
yourself, Edmund.

50:34.038 --> 50:35.240
I am my own man after all.

51:09.072 --> 51:10.375
You still here, sir?

51:11.342 --> 51:12.978
I was just on my way out.

51:13.010 --> 51:15.646
Just going over these medical
reports for the 100th time.

51:17.047 --> 51:18.449
If you're angling
for overtime,

51:18.483 --> 51:21.152
the Chief Inspector's
not back 'til tomorrow.

51:22.353 --> 51:24.289
Just trying to
make sense of it all.

51:24.322 --> 51:26.758
There's no sense
to made of it.

51:26.791 --> 51:27.993
What do you mean?

51:28.025 --> 51:29.360
Well, he's mad, sir.

51:29.393 --> 51:30.995
Whoever's doing it.

51:31.028 --> 51:34.565
There's no use trying to make
sense of what a madman does.

51:34.599 --> 51:39.104
If it made sense, he
wouldn't be mad, would he?

51:39.137 --> 51:40.072
Stands to reason.

51:40.938 --> 51:42.106
Well that's cleared
things up no end.

51:42.139 --> 51:43.273
Glad to hear it, sir.

51:43.306 --> 51:44.108
Goodnight.

51:45.076 --> 51:46.043
Goodnight.

51:48.813 --> 51:51.115
Had a bit to drink have we?

51:51.148 --> 51:53.050
Never mind, I've got
just the girl for you.

51:53.083 --> 51:56.221
Up the stairs, last
door on your left.

51:57.221 --> 51:58.623
Not me!

51:58.655 --> 52:02.126
Up the stairs with you,
last door on your left!

54:01.211 --> 54:02.313
Oh, come on!

54:02.346 --> 54:04.181
Ain't you got no home to go to?

54:05.248 --> 54:06.317
What is it?

54:06.349 --> 54:09.386
It's ten o'clock in the
morning, that's what it is.

54:09.420 --> 54:10.755
This ain't no doss house.

54:10.788 --> 54:11.623
Come on!

54:14.625 --> 54:19.630
Cathy?

54:22.733 --> 54:25.937
Cathy?

54:32.510 --> 54:34.946
Oh, erm, good morning.

54:34.978 --> 54:36.947
What's left of it.

54:36.981 --> 54:38.716
You're supposed to be
here at eight on the dot.

54:38.748 --> 54:40.184
Yes, I-

54:40.217 --> 54:41.618
- And the door was unlocked!

54:41.652 --> 54:42.720
It's a good job the
reports were in my office,

54:42.753 --> 54:45.289
you know how valuable they
are in the wrong hands.

54:46.757 --> 54:49.626
Sorry sir, I thought
you'd wanna know right away.

54:49.659 --> 54:51.395
Not another one?

54:51.429 --> 54:53.764
Just up the road.

54:53.797 --> 54:55.299
Thomas, why don't
you come with us?

54:55.333 --> 54:56.534
What?

54:56.567 --> 54:58.436
It might be useful
to see a body in situ.

54:58.469 --> 54:59.671
No thanks-

54:59.704 --> 55:01.239
- Come on, looks like
you could do with a walk

55:01.271 --> 55:01.905
in the fresh air.

55:22.260 --> 55:25.430
Up here, last
door on the left.

55:32.335 --> 55:33.404
Thomas, are you coming?

55:34.771 --> 55:37.641
Just catching my breath.

56:07.304 --> 56:09.740
You would've thought he'd
be used to this kind of thing.

56:26.056 --> 56:29.293
I need to tell you
something, Edmund,

56:32.329 --> 56:33.864
and let the chips
fall where they may.

56:35.965 --> 56:37.402
What are you talking about?

56:40.804 --> 56:42.806
I've been here before.

56:46.409 --> 56:48.045
I've been to that room.

56:50.347 --> 56:51.849
What is it you're
trying to say?

56:52.817 --> 56:53.684
It's the drink.

56:56.387 --> 56:57.455
I black out.

56:59.789 --> 57:03.295
And then when I wake up, I
don't know what I've done.

57:08.565 --> 57:13.003
I think those killings,

57:16.940 --> 57:17.775
I think I-

57:20.378 --> 57:21.846
- Inspector?

57:21.878 --> 57:23.114
There's a Miss Levine up here.

57:23.146 --> 57:24.849
She wants to see you.

57:24.882 --> 57:25.849
Oh Christ.

57:26.983 --> 57:28.018
Bare with me, Thomas.

57:43.701 --> 57:47.472
That girl was like a
daughter to me, Edmund.

57:47.505 --> 57:48.340
They all are.

57:51.175 --> 57:52.410
I'm so sorry.

57:55.012 --> 57:56.548
Sorry, yeah, well.

57:58.114 --> 57:58.949
I bet you are.

58:01.085 --> 58:03.387
I thought you were gonna
do something about this?

58:03.420 --> 58:05.389
I thought you were gonna
catch this bastard?

58:05.422 --> 58:06.957
I thought you cared
about these girls,

58:06.990 --> 58:09.994
but, you're just like
all the other coppers.

58:13.496 --> 58:15.532
I know what you think.

58:16.733 --> 58:19.436
You think it's a sordid
business, what goes on here.

58:20.737 --> 58:23.006
But I'll let you in on a
little secret, Inspector.

58:24.208 --> 58:26.077
You know what people
come here for?

58:28.679 --> 58:30.447
What they really come here for?

58:33.550 --> 58:34.985
It's love, Edmund.

58:37.454 --> 58:40.424
That's what they long for
and that's what we give them.

58:40.458 --> 58:41.893
It might be real love,

58:41.925 --> 58:44.929
but it's as close as some
of those poor buggers

58:44.961 --> 58:45.764
are gonna get.

58:50.934 --> 58:53.471
Isn't that what you
came here for, Edmund?

58:57.041 --> 58:58.710
All those years ago?

59:00.777 --> 59:02.079
My first time in London.

59:03.813 --> 59:05.416
I didn't know a single soul.

59:06.217 --> 59:09.586
A skinny, innocent
young man you were.

59:12.556 --> 59:17.461
And a good deal less innocent
when I left, thanks to you.

59:22.565 --> 59:24.568
Didn't it feel
like love, Edmund?

59:26.603 --> 59:28.071
Just for a moment?

59:33.844 --> 59:35.547
Sometimes it still does.

59:38.782 --> 59:40.718
That's just how it should be.

59:40.751 --> 59:41.820
When it's done right.

59:45.155 --> 59:46.557
But all these girls nowadays,

59:46.590 --> 59:48.492
on street corners
and back alleys.

59:48.525 --> 59:50.527
No wonder someone's
turned against them.

59:52.596 --> 59:54.065
I cant help them all, Edmund.

59:56.300 --> 59:58.470
And neither can you, it seems.

59:59.936 --> 1:00:02.973
This is a difficult case,
the evidence is pointing-

1:00:03.007 --> 1:00:04.108
- Evidence?

1:00:04.141 --> 1:00:07.110
I've got some evidence for
you, for what it's worth.

1:00:09.313 --> 1:00:10.181
What is it?

1:00:10.213 --> 1:00:11.548
The gentleman's card.

1:00:11.581 --> 1:00:12.349
The one Polly
Neilson worked for,

1:00:12.382 --> 1:00:14.151
before she was
out on the street.

1:00:15.219 --> 1:00:16.686
Bloody hell!

1:00:21.257 --> 1:00:23.860
Edmund, about what I said-

1:00:23.893 --> 1:00:25.128
- Never mind that!

1:00:25.161 --> 1:00:26.497
We've got him!

1:00:29.632 --> 1:00:30.268
What?

1:00:36.106 --> 1:00:37.208
Dr Lowry.

1:00:37.240 --> 1:00:38.041
Inspector?

1:00:39.577 --> 1:00:40.211
What is all this?

1:00:41.311 --> 1:00:43.713
I suppose there's
been some development

1:00:43.746 --> 1:00:45.081
you wish to report to me?

1:00:45.114 --> 1:00:47.817
There has indeed, sir.

1:00:47.851 --> 1:00:49.820
So, you've caught the man?

1:00:49.853 --> 1:00:51.021
You have him in custody?

1:00:52.889 --> 1:00:54.759
He is at this very
moment within the walls

1:00:54.791 --> 1:00:56.092
of this police station.

1:00:56.126 --> 1:00:57.228
Excellent news!

1:00:58.329 --> 1:01:01.666
And what manner of
man or beast is he?

1:01:01.699 --> 1:01:02.633
Have you questioned him?

1:01:02.666 --> 1:01:03.734
I am endeavoring to so.

1:01:03.766 --> 1:01:06.269
Doesn't even speak the
Queen's English, I expect.

1:01:06.302 --> 1:01:11.308
But first sir, I need to
ask what your particular

1:01:12.041 --> 1:01:13.210
interests in this case?

1:01:14.077 --> 1:01:15.278
My interest?

1:01:15.311 --> 1:01:16.813
Well, you've been
extremely forthcoming

1:01:16.847 --> 1:01:18.349
in your willingness to assist.

1:01:18.382 --> 1:01:22.052
Well naturally, as a
Whitechapel resident,

1:01:22.085 --> 1:01:24.087
and one of the better
ones if I may say,

1:01:25.255 --> 1:01:27.892
I took it upon myself
to strive tirelessly

1:01:27.925 --> 1:01:29.660
until the culprit
was apprehended.

1:01:29.693 --> 1:01:32.096
Which has involved, as
you previously stated,

1:01:32.128 --> 1:01:33.697
going from door to door.

1:01:33.731 --> 1:01:35.633
Well I didn't go myself,

1:01:35.666 --> 1:01:38.836
I have other things to attend
to, but I organized a group

1:01:38.869 --> 1:01:42.173
of similarly concerned
citizens to do so.

1:01:42.206 --> 1:01:44.141
Purely as a concerned citizen?

1:01:44.173 --> 1:01:45.275
Yes.

1:01:45.309 --> 1:01:48.379
So you don't have personal
connection to this case?

1:01:48.411 --> 1:01:49.779
Personal connection?

1:01:49.813 --> 1:01:51.715
I should say not.

1:01:51.748 --> 1:01:52.549
What are you suggesting?

1:01:52.583 --> 1:01:53.751
I'm not suggesting
anything, sir.

1:01:53.784 --> 1:01:55.152
It sounds to me very much

1:01:55.184 --> 1:01:57.922
like you are
suggesting something.

1:01:59.856 --> 1:02:02.692
Do you think a man of my
standing would have anything

1:02:02.726 --> 1:02:05.630
to do with the sort of
people involved in this case?

1:02:05.663 --> 1:02:07.298
Or, or any murder,
for that matter?

1:02:09.065 --> 1:02:12.402
I must warn you, I'm
a very good friend

1:02:12.436 --> 1:02:14.204
of your Chief Inspector.

1:02:15.438 --> 1:02:20.644
Be that as it may, I
need to ask you outright,

1:02:21.411 --> 1:02:24.915
and I require a truthful answer.

1:02:26.050 --> 1:02:29.120
Do you have any
personal connection

1:02:29.152 --> 1:02:32.722
to any of the
victims in this case?

1:02:32.755 --> 1:02:33.391
No.

1:02:33.423 --> 1:02:36.192
Mary Jane Keates?

1:02:36.226 --> 1:02:37.028
Annie Chaplin?

1:02:37.061 --> 1:02:37.862
No.

1:02:37.894 --> 1:02:38.929
Polly Neilson?

1:02:38.961 --> 1:02:39.797
No!

1:02:42.298 --> 1:02:44.768
Can you confirm that
this is your card, sir?

1:02:46.202 --> 1:02:47.103
Yes, of course it is,
it's got my name on, man.

1:02:47.137 --> 1:02:48.339
And where did you get it?

1:02:48.371 --> 1:02:49.572
I got it from a
house of ill-repute,

1:02:49.606 --> 1:02:53.411
where this morning the body of
Catherine Eastwood was found

1:02:53.443 --> 1:02:56.380
with her stomach opened
from top to bottom.

1:02:56.413 --> 1:02:58.782
Are you out of
your mind, Inspector?

1:02:58.815 --> 1:03:00.083
Well somebody is!

1:03:04.221 --> 1:03:09.226
I have never set foot
in that establishment.

1:03:10.393 --> 1:03:11.761
It was left there
by Polly Neilson.

1:03:11.795 --> 1:03:14.731
I told you I
don't know the girl.

1:03:22.773 --> 1:03:24.408
I spoke to a few
of her acquaintances

1:03:24.440 --> 1:03:26.176
on the way back here.

1:03:26.210 --> 1:03:27.711
It's easy enough to do so,

1:03:28.911 --> 1:03:30.847
there's plenty that knew
her down at the doss house.

1:03:33.382 --> 1:03:36.788
Turns out, "Polly" was a name
she acquired on the streets.

1:03:37.987 --> 1:03:41.692
Her real name was
Mary Anne Neilson.

1:03:45.896 --> 1:03:47.164
Ring a bell does it, sir?

1:03:48.331 --> 1:03:52.802
I do recall a girl
of that name, yes.

1:03:52.835 --> 1:03:54.104
Worked for you as a maid.

1:03:54.137 --> 1:03:56.007
You have to
understand, Inspector,

1:03:57.173 --> 1:03:59.275
these girls come
and go all the time.

1:03:59.309 --> 1:04:00.478
My housekeeper takes
care of it all.

1:04:00.510 --> 1:04:02.880
But you remember
this one, don't you?

1:04:04.280 --> 1:04:07.985
She told her story quite
liberally down at the doss house.

1:04:08.018 --> 1:04:09.853
She was stealing, I had
to have her dismissed.

1:04:09.887 --> 1:04:11.856
Dismissed her
personally, I believe?

1:04:11.889 --> 1:04:13.524
Threw her out on her
ear without two pennies

1:04:13.556 --> 1:04:14.924
to rub together.

1:04:14.958 --> 1:04:16.360
Is it any wonder she
ended up where she did?

1:04:16.393 --> 1:04:17.961
A thief deserves no better.

1:04:17.994 --> 1:04:19.763
How did you know
she was a thief?

1:04:21.398 --> 1:04:24.469
She had taken pieces
of silver cutlery.

1:04:26.570 --> 1:04:27.805
Go on.

1:04:29.273 --> 1:04:32.876
She secreted them in her
undergarments, isn't that so?

1:04:34.478 --> 1:04:37.947
Where you found them, in
the course of performing

1:04:37.981 --> 1:04:40.885
an indecent act upon her
person, isn't that so Dr Lowry?

1:04:40.918 --> 1:04:44.155
Damn you, Inspector, this
is no business of yours!

1:04:44.188 --> 1:04:48.092
And it has nothing to
do with these murders.

1:04:48.125 --> 1:04:50.860
Oh, I think it's got a lot
to do with these murders.

1:04:50.893 --> 1:04:52.529
I think it was entirely
in your interests

1:04:52.563 --> 1:04:56.099
that Mary Anne Neilson should
meet her fate that night.

1:04:56.132 --> 1:04:58.001
I'm sure you told her
to keep her mouth shut

1:04:58.034 --> 1:05:01.004
but there was no way of
making sure, was there?

1:05:01.038 --> 1:05:03.840
And having done it once you
acquired a taste for it.

1:05:05.074 --> 1:05:08.311
Before you deny it, let
me reveal one other fact.

1:05:08.344 --> 1:05:10.313
According to the expert analysis

1:05:10.347 --> 1:05:13.517
of the Police Medical
Examiner, these murders are not

1:05:13.550 --> 1:05:16.854
the work of some butcher
or slaughter man.

1:05:18.222 --> 1:05:20.424
The injuries inflicted
upon these bodies were done

1:05:20.456 --> 1:05:24.561
by the hand of an educated
man with clear knowledge

1:05:24.594 --> 1:05:28.098
of human anatomy, quite possibly
a doctor such as yourself.

1:05:30.199 --> 1:05:33.036
And can I also make it plain
that consider your actions

1:05:33.070 --> 1:05:35.506
since the first murder
to be highly suspicious.

1:05:36.873 --> 1:05:39.542
You have shown an unnatural
interest in the case,

1:05:39.576 --> 1:05:41.512
attempting to railroad
the investigation off

1:05:41.545 --> 1:05:43.380
in inappropriate directions,

1:05:43.413 --> 1:05:45.849
all the time trying to
shift blame from yourself.

1:05:47.251 --> 1:05:50.588
So, Dr Lowry, I have every
justification in bringing you

1:05:50.621 --> 1:05:53.590
in here for questioning, and
the question I would like

1:05:53.623 --> 1:05:58.461
to ask you, is can you
account for your movements

1:05:58.494 --> 1:06:00.998
over the last two nights?

1:06:07.036 --> 1:06:12.042
I think, perhaps, you should
ask your Chief Inspector

1:06:12.643 --> 1:06:13.443
that question.

1:06:15.545 --> 1:06:19.050
The Chief Inspector can
account for my movements.

1:06:20.217 --> 1:06:22.552
Along with around
three dozen members

1:06:22.585 --> 1:06:24.221
of his extended family.

1:06:27.291 --> 1:06:30.260
I've been away in Guildford
for the past two days

1:06:31.695 --> 1:06:33.998
attending my God
Daughter's wedding.

1:06:35.666 --> 1:06:37.534
My God Daughter who also happens

1:06:37.567 --> 1:06:42.005
to be the niece of
your Chief Inspector.

1:06:43.673 --> 1:06:47.978
They even had us pose for one
of those wretched photographs.

1:06:50.947 --> 1:06:52.949
I'm sure you can
examine the plates.

1:07:02.492 --> 1:07:06.898
Don't think for a moment
this ends here, Inspector.

1:07:22.112 --> 1:07:22.980
Did he confess?

1:07:24.181 --> 1:07:26.117
God in heaven, please
tell me he confessed.

1:07:28.117 --> 1:07:30.621
It wasn't him, airtight alibi.

1:07:30.653 --> 1:07:31.454
But you said...

1:07:31.487 --> 1:07:32.288
I know.

1:07:32.322 --> 1:07:33.590
But it had to be him!

1:07:33.623 --> 1:07:35.525
It wasn't him.

1:07:35.559 --> 1:07:36.427
Not a chance.

1:07:42.532 --> 1:07:44.936
You shouldn't take things
so personally, Thomas.

1:07:46.003 --> 1:07:47.104
It'll come to no good.

1:07:48.438 --> 1:07:50.273
I've had to learn
that lesson myself.

1:07:53.275 --> 1:07:55.078
Take a holiday.

1:07:55.112 --> 1:07:57.181
The case isn't gonna go
away in your absence.

1:08:02.184 --> 1:08:03.987
I know it's none of my business,

1:08:05.554 --> 1:08:07.090
go easy on the bottle, old man.

1:08:10.027 --> 1:08:11.595
You look like death.

1:08:20.503 --> 1:08:21.704
It cant be true.

1:08:28.712 --> 1:08:30.047
It cant be true.

1:09:19.662 --> 1:09:21.097
Good evening, Thomas.

1:09:25.601 --> 1:09:27.203
Is something amiss?

1:09:30.640 --> 1:09:31.842
No, I just... um-

1:09:31.875 --> 1:09:33.577
- There's a spare
key to that cabinet

1:09:33.609 --> 1:09:35.311
in your desk drawer, Thomas.

1:09:36.645 --> 1:09:38.048
Perhaps you'd forgotten?

1:09:40.117 --> 1:09:42.153
And I'm not a fool, Thomas.

1:09:46.155 --> 1:09:47.824
Perhaps you'd
forgotten that as well?

1:09:51.862 --> 1:09:53.463
So I'll ask again.

1:09:55.498 --> 1:09:57.233
Is something amiss?

1:09:58.768 --> 1:10:02.172
Just, just this.

1:10:03.439 --> 1:10:05.408
Something else from
your desk drawer.

1:10:06.510 --> 1:10:08.445
What's it, what's it doing-

1:10:08.478 --> 1:10:11.181
- I left it where I knew
you'd find it Thomas.

1:10:12.149 --> 1:10:13.484
Because I wanted you to know.

1:10:16.185 --> 1:10:17.420
To know what?

1:10:20.724 --> 1:10:22.693
That I know.

1:10:29.365 --> 1:10:32.136
I know about the
secret little bottles,

1:10:32.168 --> 1:10:36.206
sewn into pockets and
hidden behind books.

1:10:36.238 --> 1:10:37.306
Elizabeth, I...

1:10:37.340 --> 1:10:41.345
And I know about the secret
little walks into town.

1:10:43.412 --> 1:10:46.382
The midnight, moonlit walks.

1:10:48.918 --> 1:10:51.287
I know where you go.

1:10:51.320 --> 1:10:52.856
And I know what you do.

1:10:55.958 --> 1:10:59.496
I've walked out in your
shadow on many occasions.

1:11:03.600 --> 1:11:06.237
I'm telling you this, Thomas,

1:11:08.238 --> 1:11:11.809
because from now on,
it's going to stop.

1:11:16.746 --> 1:11:19.449
In fact, I've made sure of it.

1:11:22.284 --> 1:11:26.356
At least with regard to
those particular girls.

1:11:30.226 --> 1:11:31.228
You won't be seeing
any of them again.

1:11:34.730 --> 1:11:36.599
Except, perhaps, at your work.

1:11:39.502 --> 1:11:40.704
Dear God, Elizabeth.

1:11:41.604 --> 1:11:42.772
What are you saying?

1:11:42.805 --> 1:11:45.474
The whores got
what they deserved!

1:11:48.979 --> 1:11:51.248
Abusing their womanhood,

1:11:52.414 --> 1:11:57.220
using it to steal the
husbands of good women!

1:11:59.889 --> 1:12:02.226
You're a weak man, Thomas.

1:12:03.592 --> 1:12:07.230
Easily led from the
straight and narrow path.

1:12:10.500 --> 1:12:14.404
That's why I blame
them, rather than you.

1:12:16.305 --> 1:12:19.242
That's why I had
to do what I did.

1:12:24.546 --> 1:12:26.616
Christ in heaven, Elizabeth.

1:12:28.417 --> 1:12:29.485
You'll hang for this.

1:12:31.854 --> 1:12:32.755
Why should I?

1:12:33.957 --> 1:12:35.993
No one but you or
I will ever know.

1:12:37.961 --> 1:12:42.365
And in case you ever think
of sharing this knowledge,

1:12:42.399 --> 1:12:47.404
think on this, Thomas, there
is no evidence to connect me

1:12:48.037 --> 1:12:49.472
to these events.

1:12:52.074 --> 1:12:53.344
But as for you-

1:12:55.612 --> 1:12:56.680
- What are you saying?

1:12:57.881 --> 1:13:01.318
If anyone ever asks
me your whereabouts

1:13:01.350 --> 1:13:04.255
on certain times or dates, well-

1:13:05.454 --> 1:13:08.826
- There is evidence, somewhere.

1:13:10.659 --> 1:13:12.028
Certain organs were removed.

1:13:12.061 --> 1:13:16.500
Oh, Thomas, you disappoint me.

1:13:20.737 --> 1:13:22.640
I never blamed you, Thomas,

1:13:24.373 --> 1:13:28.278
but I must admit
a certain pleasure

1:13:29.712 --> 1:13:32.750
in seeing you destroy the
very evidence you speak of.

1:13:35.085 --> 1:13:40.291
And watching you
enjoy every last bite.

1:13:53.403 --> 1:13:54.905
It's getting late.

1:13:58.475 --> 1:14:00.711
We should head to the bedroom.

1:14:06.149 --> 1:14:08.052
Perhaps you can lie
beside me tonight?

1:14:54.463 --> 1:14:55.931
Morning Thomas.

1:14:55.965 --> 1:14:57.534
I was just on my way out.

1:14:58.501 --> 1:14:59.101
On your rounds?

1:14:59.135 --> 1:14:59.970
No.

1:15:01.069 --> 1:15:02.405
Out for good.

1:15:02.439 --> 1:15:03.673
Chief Inspector's orders.

1:15:05.507 --> 1:15:06.943
Seems my handling
of the Ripper case

1:15:06.975 --> 1:15:09.380
wasn't as successful
as he would have liked.

1:15:10.747 --> 1:15:11.949
You cant win them all.

1:15:13.983 --> 1:15:14.818
I suppose not.

1:15:16.685 --> 1:15:18.454
Funny thing though,
there hasn't been

1:15:18.488 --> 1:15:20.990
another murder for the
last couple of days.

1:15:21.024 --> 1:15:22.126
Perhaps it's all over.

1:15:23.859 --> 1:15:25.461
Perhaps it is.

1:15:25.494 --> 1:15:27.163
We can
but hope, anyway.

1:15:28.497 --> 1:15:29.899
You seem to be taking it well.

1:15:31.467 --> 1:15:32.802
I thought it was
your life's work,

1:15:32.836 --> 1:15:34.438
bringing justice to Whitechapel?

1:15:36.538 --> 1:15:38.509
I may have been
wrong about that.

1:15:40.577 --> 1:15:41.412
I'm sure I was.

1:15:43.746 --> 1:15:46.449
There's more to life
that work, Thomas.

1:15:48.217 --> 1:15:51.488
And whatever else
happens, life goes on.

1:15:52.555 --> 1:15:53.590
Yes.

1:15:56.225 --> 1:15:59.496
Well, the best of luck to you.

1:15:59.529 --> 1:16:02.933
I, er, I've got an
appointment to keep.

1:16:04.900 --> 1:16:07.570
You going somewhere, pleasant?

1:16:10.539 --> 1:16:11.475
Just up the road.

1:17:26.783 --> 1:17:28.285
Are you set to go?

1:17:29.351 --> 1:17:30.586
I am.

1:17:34.890 --> 1:17:36.826
So, where are we going?

1:17:39.662 --> 1:17:42.231
Somewhere a long
way from here.
