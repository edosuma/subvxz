He doesn't want the contest.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.692
He says it's silly.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.196
He feels that I should just
sell the business to a developer

08:08.196 --> 08:09.530
and be done with it.

08:09.530 --> 08:10.656
No, that can't happen.

Carson has the ability
to veto them,

They've turned it into
some snobby bistro

09:32.238 --> 09:34.448
that no one likes.

09:34.448 --> 09:38.452
Brad, uh, works as
the pastry chef there.

09:38.452 --> 09:40.162
Oh...

09:40.162 --> 09:40.997
[awkward chuckle]

09:42.164 --> 09:44.750
And what do you do, Holly?

09:44.750 --> 09:48.754
Oh, Holly, uh, is
a food stylist in New York.

09:48.754 --> 09:51.716
She works for all
the major magazines.

09:51.716 --> 09:53.592
That's very impressive.

09:53.592 --> 09:54.760
Thank you.

09:54.760 --> 09:55.970
Oh! I almost forgot.

09:55.970 --> 09:57.471
The contest.

09:57.471 --> 09:58.973
[giggles]

09:58.973 --> 10:02.143
Here are a couple of the flyers.

10:02.143 --> 10:05.855
Now, one of our customers
was nice enough to say

10:05.855 --> 10:08.357
that I could use
their special events building.

10:08.357 --> 10:11.819
It's a lovely, gorgeous,
old renovated barn.

10:11.819 --> 10:13.154
I think I went
to a wedding there once!

10:13.154 --> 10:14.155
It's lovely.

10:14.155 --> 10:15.281
Lovely, yes.

10:15.281 --> 10:16.449
It's gonna be perfect.

10:16.449 --> 10:19.327
Mm. Well, thank you,
and I can't wait.

10:19.327 --> 10:20.202
Oh.

10:20.202 --> 10:22.371
-Bye.
-Bye.

10:22.371 --> 10:24.332
Oh, gosh, look at the time.

10:24.332 --> 10:26.417
I have to go make
a video call!

10:26.417 --> 10:28.419
-[giggles]
-Have fun.

10:28.419 --> 10:30.671
Second Day of Christmas
gingerbread to go.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.757
Thank you, Loretta.

10:34.091 --> 10:36.761
[♪♪♪]

10:38.346 --> 10:40.931
[Mrs. Rose humming cheerily]

10:43.351 --> 10:46.687
It's your Christmas bread!

10:46.687 --> 10:49.482
Oh, I didn't think you'd have
time to make it this year,

10:49.482 --> 10:52.318
with the move and the contest.

10:52.318 --> 10:55.821
It has been your favorite
since you were a child, Carson.

10:55.821 --> 10:58.366
I have never sold it
in the bakery.

10:58.366 --> 10:59.825
It is only for you.

10:59.825 --> 11:03.537
Of course, I took time
to make it!

11:03.537 --> 11:04.663
[sighs contentedly]

11:04.663 --> 11:06.791
No one can bake like you, Mom.

11:08.084 --> 11:09.710
You know, I used to love
this time of year.

11:09.710 --> 11:13.047
All those Christmas mornings
in my snowsuit,

11:13.047 --> 11:14.215
with Dad,
going tobogganing.

11:14.215 --> 11:17.385
Ohh, I remember it
like it was yesterday.

11:17.385 --> 11:20.012
I would bundle you up
to go outside.

11:20.012 --> 11:22.390
You weren't
halfway down the sidewalk

11:22.390 --> 11:24.058
before you'd turn around,
come back--

11:24.058 --> 11:25.643
"I gotta use the bathroom!"

11:25.643 --> 11:26.852
[both laughing]

11:26.852 --> 11:28.229
Dad was so patient,

11:28.229 --> 11:29.855
waiting around for me
right outside,

11:29.855 --> 11:31.232
while I was taking my time.

11:31.232 --> 11:32.858
He had a Thermos of hot coffee.

11:32.858 --> 11:33.859
He was fine.

11:33.859 --> 11:36.570
And getting you outside
to run off energy

11:36.570 --> 11:38.239
was his Christmas duty.

11:38.239 --> 11:42.243
Mine was to get in there
and work on that turkey.

11:43.411 --> 11:45.579
You know, I never did
ask you before,

11:45.579 --> 11:47.873
but with the bakery
keeping you so busy,

11:47.873 --> 11:50.543
did you enjoy making
all those holiday dinners

11:50.543 --> 11:51.544
for us every year?

11:51.544 --> 11:53.170
Every one of 'em.

11:54.588 --> 11:56.715
Making a meal for your family

11:56.715 --> 11:58.592
to sit down
and enjoy together,

11:58.592 --> 12:02.763
oh, that has always been
a highlight for me.

12:03.848 --> 12:06.434
[Carson chuckling softly]

12:06.434 --> 12:09.437
What are you smiling about?

12:09.437 --> 12:11.772
It's all this talk,

12:11.772 --> 12:14.859
it reminds me
that I still love Christmas.

12:14.859 --> 12:18.279
Mm, now, I never doubted that
for a moment, Carson.

12:18.279 --> 12:20.156
-[phone rings]
-Oh!

12:20.156 --> 12:22.074
Let me guess.

12:22.074 --> 12:22.950
Christian?

12:22.950 --> 12:26.162
-We have a date!
-[giggling]

12:26.162 --> 12:27.997
You go on, Mom.

12:27.997 --> 12:30.583
I can't wait
to show Madison to you

12:30.583 --> 12:31.584
at this time of year.

12:31.584 --> 12:35.296
The Christmas lights
all over town.

12:35.296 --> 12:37.089
<i>It sounds impressive.</i>

12:37.089 --> 12:39.967
<i>I can't wait for us
to watch the Northern Lights.</i>

12:39.967 --> 12:41.469
<i>Now, that's a light show.</i>

12:41.469 --> 12:44.972
Oh, that sounds
so romantic.

12:44.972 --> 12:48.142
And it will be,
because we'll be together.

12:48.142 --> 12:51.145
Do you ever wonder
where we'd be

12:51.145 --> 12:54.982
if I had not
taken that Alaskan cruise?

12:54.982 --> 12:56.942
No, I don't.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.277
And do you know why?

12:58.277 --> 12:59.487
<i>Why?</i>

12:59.487 --> 13:01.614
I never thought
I'd fall in love again,

13:01.614 --> 13:03.324
<i>and now that it has happened,</i>

13:03.324 --> 13:05.784
<i>I don't want to question it.</i>

13:05.784 --> 13:07.161
<i>And I certainly</i>

13:07.161 --> 13:09.580
<i>don't want to wonder what life
would be like without you.</i>

13:09.580 --> 13:11.832
Oh, I just hope
your flight is not delayed

13:11.832 --> 13:14.126
because this storm is coming.

13:14.126 --> 13:15.503
<i>Honey...</i>

13:15.503 --> 13:17.505
<i>I will make my way to Madison,</i>

13:17.505 --> 13:19.673

13:19.673 --> 13:22.343
<i>You can count on me
being there for Christmas.</i>

13:23.385 --> 13:26.096
[♪♪♪]

13:33.395 --> 13:34.522
Hey...

13:34.522 --> 13:36.232
Hey.

13:36.232 --> 13:38.192
I'm sorry about what I said.

13:38.192 --> 13:40.611
I'm sure your pastries
are delicious.

13:40.611 --> 13:42.696
Your heard wrong
about the inn, by the way.

13:42.696 --> 13:44.281
It does well
with tourists and locals.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.658
The snobby ones, anyways.

13:45.658 --> 13:47.576
[chuckles]

13:47.576 --> 13:50.204
So... you live in New York?

13:50.204 --> 13:51.539
-Manhattan.
-Ah.

13:51.539 --> 13:52.873
Then you must
find Madison a bit dull.

13:52.873 --> 13:53.958
Bet you can't wait
to get home.

13:53.958 --> 13:56.168
Madison is home.

13:56.168 --> 13:57.628
Thought Manhattan was home?

13:59.380 --> 14:03.092
Why are you
entering the contest, anyway?

14:03.092 --> 14:05.010
I mean, you've got
a great job at the inn.

14:05.010 --> 14:06.387
I've always wanted
a place of my own,

14:06.387 --> 14:08.806
but that requires
a large investment,

14:08.806 --> 14:11.267
so I'm just gonna
win it instead.

14:12.393 --> 14:14.228
Thinking of entering
the contest myself,

14:14.228 --> 14:15.854
but I'm not much of a baker.

14:15.854 --> 14:17.398
Ah, then I wouldn't
waste your time.

14:17.398 --> 14:18.691
Excuse me?

14:18.691 --> 14:19.733
Oh, I don't mean to offend.

14:19.733 --> 14:22.069
It's just that...
baking's very personal.

14:22.069 --> 14:24.071
You either have the touch
or you don't.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.906
Wait. I thought baking
was a science.

14:25.906 --> 14:27.449
Chemistry.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.326
Well, there are recipes,
yeah, but...

14:29.326 --> 14:31.036
What did you bake
this morning?

14:31.036 --> 14:32.580
Tarte Tatin.

14:32.580 --> 14:35.708
Tarte Tatin
isn't exactly Christmas, though.

14:35.708 --> 14:38.586
I mean, people want
sticky toffee pudding

14:38.586 --> 14:40.421
and gingerbread.

14:40.421 --> 14:43.632
Well, thank you
for the advice, but...

14:43.632 --> 14:44.758
I gotta get going.

14:44.758 --> 14:46.260
Have a nice afternoon.

14:46.260 --> 14:48.304
-I'll see you around.
-Yeah.

14:48.304 --> 14:51.098
[♪♪♪]

14:59.023 --> 15:00.441
So...

15:00.441 --> 15:02.610
did you run into
any of the old gang?

15:02.610 --> 15:04.737
I didn't see anyone.

15:04.737 --> 15:07.114
Do you know
a guy named Brad?

15:07.114 --> 15:08.949
He works at the inn?

15:08.949 --> 15:11.785
Oh! Is he
the really handsome one?

15:11.785 --> 15:13.454
Is he really handsome, Holly?

15:13.454 --> 15:15.789
I didn't notice.
He's the pastry chef?

15:15.789 --> 15:17.958
Oh, yeah. Yeah,
I saw him at the grocery store.

15:17.958 --> 15:19.627
Oh, so he made an impression.

15:19.627 --> 15:22.087
Honey, I love your father,

15:22.087 --> 15:23.797
but I do notice
a good-looking man,

15:23.797 --> 15:25.966
and Mrs. Rose
thinks he's lovely.

15:25.966 --> 15:28.010
Mm, I'm not so sure about that.

15:28.010 --> 15:28.969
Why?

15:28.969 --> 15:30.638
He's entering
the baking competition

15:30.638 --> 15:34.141
and something tells me
that, if he wins,

15:34.141 --> 15:36.143
Mrs. Rose's
will no longer be

15:36.143 --> 15:38.145
the place that
we know and love.

15:39.229 --> 15:41.357
But he is a baker, right?

15:41.357 --> 15:42.733
<i>French</i> pastries.

15:42.733 --> 15:45.110
Which isn't the spirit
of Mrs. Rose's shop,

15:45.110 --> 15:47.321
and certainly not
this time of year.

15:47.321 --> 15:50.866
Honey, I think you're missing
the spirit of the holidays.

15:50.866 --> 15:52.326
He's just so overconfident.

15:52.326 --> 15:54.620
It's like he just assumes
he's going to win.

15:54.620 --> 15:57.498
Oh, you do
find him attractive, then.

15:57.498 --> 15:59.708
No. No, not at all.

15:59.708 --> 16:01.669
Well, what difference
does it make to you, anyway?

16:01.669 --> 16:03.003
I mean, you're gonna be
off to New York,

16:03.003 --> 16:04.338
and if Brad wins,

16:04.338 --> 16:06.840
he can bake all the flambés
and clafoutis that he wants,

16:06.840 --> 16:08.342
and no one's gonna be here
to stop him.

16:08.342 --> 16:10.469
I do love it
when they light a flambé.

16:10.469 --> 16:12.096
-Mom.
-Oh. Uh, I'm sorry.

16:12.096 --> 16:14.306
It's just...
It's just so, uh...

16:14.306 --> 16:15.599
dramatic.

16:27.236 --> 16:29.571
[♪♪♪]

16:33.117 --> 16:36.078
This whole area here...

16:40.207 --> 16:42.167
Uh, good morning.

16:42.167 --> 16:44.044
Oh, morning, Holly.

16:44.044 --> 16:45.754
Who's that man?

16:45.754 --> 16:49.049
Oh, that...
is a real estate developer.

16:49.049 --> 16:51.051
Carson is meeting with
a few of them

16:51.051 --> 16:53.387
to make sure he gets
a great deal.

16:53.387 --> 16:55.389
But the contest
hasn't even started yet.

16:55.389 --> 16:57.015
I know.

16:57.015 --> 17:01.186
But Carson doesn't believe
anyone will win the contest.

17:01.186 --> 17:02.354
Excuse me.

17:02.354 --> 17:06.233
I am going to go and start
on tomorrow's desserts.

17:08.402 --> 17:10.404
Can I get you a coffee, Holly?
On me.

17:10.404 --> 17:12.906
Are you selling the bakery
to that man?

17:12.906 --> 17:14.742
-I know you love this place--
-I do.

17:14.742 --> 17:16.076
It was my first job.

17:16.076 --> 17:20.289
I mean, weekends, after school,
summer holidays... vacations.

17:20.289 --> 17:23.083
You, Loretta, and I,
practically grew up here.

17:23.083 --> 17:24.542
It's a business decision.

17:24.542 --> 17:26.044
You're forgetting
about the contest.

17:26.044 --> 17:29.381
Look, it's a fun idea,
and I support my mom,

17:29.381 --> 17:30.466
I do,

17:30.466 --> 17:32.551
but no one's gonna be
able to bake like her.

17:32.551 --> 17:34.595
Your mom has found love again.

17:34.595 --> 17:36.638
That's a gift, Carson,

17:36.638 --> 17:40.392
but this-- this contest
is very real to her.

17:40.392 --> 17:42.060
And besides, it's Christmas!

17:42.060 --> 17:44.271
Isn't the whole point love?

17:44.271 --> 17:45.439
Isn't the main point

17:45.439 --> 17:47.649
that it's better
to give than receive?

17:47.649 --> 17:48.776
Exactly.

17:48.776 --> 17:50.778
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

17:50.778 --> 17:52.446
I mean, are you really

17:52.446 --> 17:54.782
not going to let your mother
give away the bakery?

17:54.782 --> 17:57.451
Look, if someone can truly
bake like my mom,

17:57.451 --> 17:58.827
then the bakery's theirs.

17:58.827 --> 18:00.996
I just don't think
anyone can do it.

18:00.996 --> 18:02.873
So, as a realist,

18:02.873 --> 18:04.291
I'm just getting prepared
for when my mom moves away,

18:04.291 --> 18:06.126
and the town must move on.

18:06.126 --> 18:07.836
Have you told your mother
how you feel?

18:07.836 --> 18:09.630
About selling the building?

18:09.630 --> 18:12.174
About her moving away.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.928
I've got--
I've got to get to work.

18:15.928 --> 18:17.054
Enjoy the coffee.

18:29.149 --> 18:30.609
Oh! Welcome home, Holly.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.402
We've missed you.

18:32.402 --> 18:33.654
I've missed you guys, too.

18:33.654 --> 18:35.489
What have you got there?

18:35.489 --> 18:37.324
Uh, I'm gonna try my hand
at baking.

18:37.324 --> 18:39.660
You know,
they have recipes online, huh?

18:39.660 --> 18:41.662
I know,
but I'm old-fashioned,

18:41.662 --> 18:43.330
and this book looked like
a classic.

18:43.330 --> 18:44.581
Sure is big enough.

18:44.581 --> 18:46.250
-[chuckles]
-I'll see you later.

18:46.250 --> 18:48.377
Okay.

18:49.753 --> 18:52.506
Oh, so lovely to see you.

18:52.506 --> 18:54.007
What are you making today?

18:54.007 --> 18:55.509
Well, I have crepes on my mind.

Aw, crepes!

-Nice to see you.
-You too.

19:02.391 --> 19:04.893
[♪♪♪]

19:09.690 --> 19:11.942
[gasps]

19:15.904 --> 19:17.781
Can I help you?

19:17.781 --> 19:20.409
Just I know that cookbook.
It's a classic.

19:25.205 --> 19:27.165
Whatcha making?

19:27.165 --> 19:28.709
Shortbread.

19:28.709 --> 19:30.794
Oh, that's a good choice.
It's nice and easy.

19:30.794 --> 19:33.839
I didn't choose it
because of that.

19:33.839 --> 19:35.340
That's--
That's not what I meant.

19:35.340 --> 19:37.301
It's my favorite.

19:37.301 --> 19:39.303
Okay.

19:41.054 --> 19:44.308
Here, let me tell you my secret
to making the best shortbread.

19:44.308 --> 19:47.561
You take unsalted butter
and you add it to the bowl,

19:47.561 --> 19:48.687
and then you--

19:48.687 --> 19:50.272
You know, I think
I've got it handled,

19:50.272 --> 19:51.732
so if you'll excuse me,

19:51.732 --> 19:53.275
I've got to find the eggs.

19:53.275 --> 19:54.735
Actually, you don't put--

19:54.735 --> 19:56.737
Have a lovely day, Brad.

19:57.905 --> 20:00.324
[♪♪♪]

20:06.538 --> 20:08.332
Aw, whoa.

20:08.332 --> 20:11.293
Looks like you just had a fight
with the Pillsbury Doughboy

20:11.293 --> 20:12.753
and lost.

20:12.753 --> 20:13.962
Very funny.

20:13.962 --> 20:17.090
I'm trying to make shortbread
the way Mrs. Rose does.

20:17.090 --> 20:18.091
Oh, well, let me help.

20:18.091 --> 20:19.718
-Whoa!
-Mom, Mom, Mom, please, no.

20:19.718 --> 20:22.930
Mom, step away
from the cookie pan.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.265
Well...

20:25.265 --> 20:27.267
since you've taken over
my kitchen,

20:27.267 --> 20:29.102
you can both clean up the mess

20:29.102 --> 20:31.438
and put the presents
under the tree.

20:33.315 --> 20:35.609
I'm just gonna put these
in the oven first.

20:35.609 --> 20:38.946
I think they're gonna be
really special.

20:41.573 --> 20:42.866
[indistinct exchange]

20:42.866 --> 20:43.909
-Oh!
-Oh, wow.

20:46.787 --> 20:49.706
[♪♪♪]

20:50.832 --> 20:51.959
Thanks.

20:51.959 --> 20:53.168
What?

20:53.168 --> 20:54.419
Mm--

20:54.419 --> 20:55.963
Maybe you should
you try one, dear.

20:58.298 --> 20:59.383
Oh! Dad, no.

20:59.383 --> 21:00.509
What?

21:00.509 --> 21:02.844
Dad, they didn't turn out
the way I wanted them to.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.971
[Mom chuckles]

21:03.971 --> 21:06.098
Aw, sweetie,
you take after me.

21:06.098 --> 21:07.349
It's that simple.

21:07.349 --> 21:09.309
Yeah, I suck at baking.

21:09.309 --> 21:11.603
Don't be so hard on yourself.

21:11.603 --> 21:12.688
Yeah, but the cookies
look really pretty.

21:12.688 --> 21:13.522
Yeah.

21:13.522 --> 21:15.440
No.

21:21.113 --> 21:22.864
[sighing wearily]

21:22.864 --> 21:24.116
Hey.

21:24.116 --> 21:26.284
I followed the recipe!

21:26.284 --> 21:27.869
It's just shortbread.
Don't worry about it.

21:27.869 --> 21:30.163
More importantly,
how's your life in New York?

21:30.163 --> 21:32.457
I applied for a job
at <i> Urban Gourmet.</i>

21:32.457 --> 21:34.334
I really want it.

21:34.334 --> 21:35.669
I'm sure you'll get it.

21:37.295 --> 21:39.506
It's probably
just the holidays,

21:39.506 --> 21:41.758
but sometimes my life
in New York

21:41.758 --> 21:43.719
is not all
it's cracked up to be.

21:43.719 --> 21:46.138
Sort of like the eggs
in this shortbread.

21:46.138 --> 21:48.473
Oh! There-- There are no eggs
in shortbread.

21:48.473 --> 21:50.142
-Oh, yes, there are.
-No.

21:50.142 --> 21:51.560
Even I know that.

21:53.145 --> 21:54.187
Oh, no.

21:54.187 --> 21:55.188
[laughing]

21:55.188 --> 21:56.940
I was following
the sugar cookie recipe

21:56.940 --> 21:58.650
on the same page.

21:58.650 --> 22:00.569
At least, as far as
the eggs are concerned.

22:00.569 --> 22:01.987
Oh.

22:01.987 --> 22:05.282
At least we have
these to make up for it.

22:05.282 --> 22:06.533
Yeah, for now.

22:06.533 --> 22:09.661
But what about next Christmas?

22:16.418 --> 22:18.045
[Holly sighing]

22:18.045 --> 22:20.547
I have an announcement
to make.

22:21.673 --> 22:24.634
I am entering
Mrs. Rose's baking competition.

22:27.637 --> 22:28.638
Did you hear me?

22:30.390 --> 22:32.976
Are you sure, Holly?

22:34.478 --> 22:36.063
I think it's a great idea.

22:36.063 --> 22:38.899
Thank you, Dad, for being
the only one who believes in me.

22:38.899 --> 22:41.818
Uh, he didn't even
eat the shortbread.

22:44.738 --> 22:46.865
It was a rookie mistake.

22:46.865 --> 22:48.450
I misread the recipe.

22:48.450 --> 22:51.828
I mean, no one loves
the 12 Days of Christmas baking

22:51.828 --> 22:53.121
more than I do,

22:53.121 --> 22:55.749
and Carson had
a developer in the shop today,

22:55.749 --> 22:57.125
right under his mother's nose.

22:57.125 --> 22:58.251
It's not right.

22:58.251 --> 23:00.045
Your enthusiasm
is admirable, sweetheart.

23:00.045 --> 23:01.630
I mean it, Dad.

23:01.630 --> 23:05.759
Mom, Caroline, the bake shop
is pure Christmas magic,

23:05.759 --> 23:08.970
and the whole town deserves
to have it exactly as it's been.

23:08.970 --> 23:10.972
Well, someone
will win it, Holly.

23:10.972 --> 23:12.766
-Maybe the Brad guy.
-Oh, yeah.

23:12.766 --> 23:13.934
That's what I'm worried about.

23:13.934 --> 23:16.228
Even if someone can bake
like Mrs. Rose,

23:16.228 --> 23:17.354
and Carson agrees,

23:17.354 --> 23:18.605
once the lease is signed,

23:18.605 --> 23:21.733
they can do anything they want
with the place.

23:21.733 --> 23:23.985
I know how to keep it
just the way it is.

23:23.985 --> 23:26.321
Except for the whole, like,
baking part.

23:27.447 --> 23:29.116
I can learn!

23:29.116 --> 23:30.951
I will learn!

23:32.327 --> 23:34.121
Well, you have
our full support,

23:34.121 --> 23:36.123
and we'll do whatever we can.

23:36.123 --> 23:37.290
Yeah. Hey.

23:37.290 --> 23:38.667
To Holly...

23:38.667 --> 23:42.462
our newly-crowned
holiday baker.

23:42.462 --> 23:44.131
-To Holly.
-To Holly.

23:48.677 --> 23:50.637
[♪♪♪]

23:50.637 --> 23:53.098
We have one week
before Christmas Eve,

23:53.098 --> 23:56.810
and so we're making
only six of the 12 recipes

23:56.810 --> 23:58.812
that I bake each year.

23:58.812 --> 24:01.606
Now, as I stated
in the contest rules,

24:01.606 --> 24:04.985
I will not
be providing the recipes.

24:04.985 --> 24:06.945
Instead,

24:06.945 --> 24:08.405
each of you

24:08.405 --> 24:11.199
will taste a day's dessert

24:11.199 --> 24:12.659
and blindly duplicate it.

24:12.659 --> 24:14.953
You will go
to the grocery store,

24:14.953 --> 24:16.121
buy your ingredients,

24:16.121 --> 24:17.956
and you will come back here

24:17.956 --> 24:19.082
and bake.

24:19.082 --> 24:22.836
Myself, Carson, and Loretta
will be the judges.

24:22.836 --> 24:24.838
You will be judged on taste,

24:24.838 --> 24:26.214
presentation,

24:26.214 --> 24:28.175
and my favorite,

24:28.175 --> 24:30.010
"holiday magic."

24:30.010 --> 24:31.469
[gasps] Uh...

24:31.469 --> 24:32.512
Yes, Vera?

24:32.512 --> 24:35.849
What exactly do you mean
by holiday magic?

24:35.849 --> 24:38.310
Vera,
if you have to ask...

24:38.310 --> 24:40.562
[awkward chuckles]

24:42.147 --> 24:43.773
At the end of the baking day,

24:43.773 --> 24:46.985
whoever has the most points
is the winner.

24:46.985 --> 24:49.863
Whoever has the fewest points
is eliminated.

24:49.863 --> 24:51.907
Any more questions?

24:53.867 --> 24:55.619
Now, I grew up
on my mother's baking

24:55.619 --> 24:58.163
and I know what the 12 Days
of Christmas desserts

24:58.163 --> 24:59.831
are supposed to taste like.

24:59.831 --> 25:02.709
Which means if, in the end,
no one's been able to achieve

25:02.709 --> 25:03.877
the level my mother has,

25:03.877 --> 25:04.878
no one wins.

25:04.878 --> 25:05.712
What?

25:05.712 --> 25:07.047
Is that really fair?

25:07.047 --> 25:09.216
I mean, we've all committed
so much of our time to be here,

25:09.216 --> 25:11.218
and fight for a chance
to win the bakery.

25:11.218 --> 25:12.385
I'm a fair man,

25:12.385 --> 25:14.679
and if someone can
bake like my mother,

25:14.679 --> 25:15.972
then I won't stand in the way.

25:15.972 --> 25:19.517
But I also won't give over
her legacy to just anyone.

25:19.517 --> 25:21.228
Okay, enough of that point.

25:21.228 --> 25:23.063
Let's get this contest rolling!

25:23.063 --> 25:24.981
[Mrs. Rose giggles]

25:24.981 --> 25:27.943
The names of the recipes,
all 12,

25:27.943 --> 25:29.194
are in this hat.

25:29.194 --> 25:33.865
I will draw one each day
and it will be like a surprise.

25:33.865 --> 25:36.243
Okay, today... gingerbread!

25:43.333 --> 25:45.168
There you go.

25:52.509 --> 25:54.511
May the best baker win.

26:05.021 --> 26:06.940
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:10.735 --> 26:12.445
You got everything you need?

26:12.445 --> 26:14.614
Yep! Got everything I need.

26:15.907 --> 26:17.534
You sure?

26:17.534 --> 26:19.286
Yeah. I'm sure.

26:19.286 --> 26:20.578
Okay, good.

26:20.578 --> 26:22.539
Good.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.666
[quietly] Good.

26:36.803 --> 26:38.805
That sure is an impressive
array of, uh...

26:38.805 --> 26:40.473
decorations.

26:40.473 --> 26:42.309
Tools of the trade, Brad.

26:42.309 --> 26:43.435
What are you gonna do

26:43.435 --> 26:45.228
to make your gingerbread people
more stylish?

26:45.228 --> 26:47.147
Well, I prefer to focus

26:47.147 --> 26:50.066
on substance and taste.

26:52.819 --> 26:55.155
You know,
so my gingerbread people

26:55.155 --> 26:57.907
will definitely not
be fashionable.

26:57.907 --> 26:58.908
[Holly chuckles]

26:58.908 --> 27:00.952
[♪♪♪]

27:00.952 --> 27:02.287
Oh, no.

27:02.287 --> 27:03.663
You okay?

27:03.663 --> 27:05.165
I forgot the egg.

27:05.165 --> 27:06.207
Oh.

27:06.207 --> 27:07.959
I mixed up
the shortbread recipe

27:07.959 --> 27:09.878
with the gingerbread recipe.

27:09.878 --> 27:11.338
It's okay.
You can have one of mine.

27:11.338 --> 27:13.465
-Here.
-No, I'll make do without.

27:13.465 --> 27:15.008
It's not gonna
taste good, though.

27:15.008 --> 27:18.553
Maybe I'll get extra points
on presentation and magic.

27:45.872 --> 27:49.501
I'm surprised my gingerbread
turned out so well,

27:49.501 --> 27:50.835
seeing as I forgot the egg.

27:50.835 --> 27:51.920
Well, like you said,

27:51.920 --> 27:54.172
it's the Christmas magic
component of the contest.

27:56.591 --> 27:59.219
[♪♪♪]

27:59.219 --> 28:00.762
You know, a little extra icing

28:00.762 --> 28:02.555
might help liven up
your cookie people,

28:02.555 --> 28:03.556
bring them a little joy.

28:03.556 --> 28:05.558
My cookies are fine, thanks.

28:08.019 --> 28:09.270
Hey, uh--

28:09.270 --> 28:11.022
See?

28:11.022 --> 28:12.690
Pretty.

28:12.690 --> 28:15.777
My gingerpeople
are a simple folk.

28:15.777 --> 28:19.406
What? Style can be simple.

28:19.406 --> 28:22.200
Okay! Time is up
for today.

28:22.200 --> 28:25.495
Loretta will collect the cookies
for judging.

28:27.080 --> 28:28.081
Good.

28:28.081 --> 28:30.542
Thank you, Loretta.

28:30.542 --> 28:32.877
Thanks.

28:34.379 --> 28:36.923
[Mrs. Rose]
Let the judging begin!

28:36.923 --> 28:39.092
[♪♪♪]

28:42.595 --> 28:45.348
Mm. Mm-hmm.

28:47.559 --> 28:50.145
[chuckles]
You brought the fan club.

28:50.145 --> 28:53.481
[Holly] That's what
family's for, isn't it?

28:53.481 --> 28:56.276
We are asking that
each of you step forward

28:56.276 --> 28:57.610
when we call your name,

28:57.610 --> 29:00.488
so that we can
announce the results.

29:00.488 --> 29:02.907
Loretta here will be keeping
a running score

29:02.907 --> 29:05.368
of the final numbers.

29:05.368 --> 29:07.495
Wilma.

29:08.496 --> 29:10.123
Very good try.

29:10.123 --> 29:12.917
My final score is 7.5.

29:13.960 --> 29:15.378
I gave you a six.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.423
I gave you a four.

29:18.423 --> 29:21.301
Ooh... Tough judge.

29:21.301 --> 29:23.928
[Carson]
The girl's got taste.

29:28.016 --> 29:29.809
Brad.

29:29.809 --> 29:31.102
[thumps table]

29:31.102 --> 29:33.396
Well done.
I gave you a nine.

29:34.397 --> 29:35.815
Eight.

29:35.815 --> 29:37.150
8.5.

29:38.693 --> 29:41.029
Looks like Brad's
the one to beat.

29:42.113 --> 29:44.741
Okay, and last,
but not least--

29:44.741 --> 29:46.034
Holly?

29:47.994 --> 29:50.997
Final score,
I gave you a six.

29:50.997 --> 29:53.875
I gave Holly a four.

29:53.875 --> 29:55.001
I gave you a six.

29:55.001 --> 29:56.169
[quietly] Sorry.

29:57.754 --> 30:00.548
I'm no mathematician,
but I think I won.

30:00.548 --> 30:03.635
I think I... didn't lose?

30:05.011 --> 30:07.514
In first place,
no surprise,

30:07.514 --> 30:09.516
Brad Beauchamp.

30:09.516 --> 30:11.184
[all applauding]

30:16.314 --> 30:19.150
And the person
that is going home today...

30:21.569 --> 30:22.654
...Vera.

30:22.654 --> 30:25.031
-What?
-I'm sorry.

30:25.031 --> 30:26.533
[all applauding]

30:26.533 --> 30:28.910
Thank you, and please,
enjoy your gift basket.

30:31.829 --> 30:33.081
Enjoy!

30:33.081 --> 30:34.541
Congrats
on staying in the game.

30:34.541 --> 30:36.251
Congratulations on winning...

30:36.251 --> 30:37.293
today.

30:37.293 --> 30:39.379
Ah, I think I got this.

30:39.379 --> 30:41.464
Mm, I think
you're forgetting Carson.

30:48.846 --> 30:50.598
[door bells jingle]

30:50.598 --> 30:53.059
[chuckling]
Oh! Look at the bundt cake.

30:53.059 --> 30:54.394
Hey, Mrs. Rose.

30:54.394 --> 30:55.603
Congratulations on the contest.

30:55.603 --> 30:57.063
It's really fun to watch.

30:57.063 --> 30:58.731
Oh, thank you, Caroline.

30:58.731 --> 31:00.567
You know,
would you consider giving

31:00.567 --> 31:02.402
some of the leftovers
to the audience?

31:02.402 --> 31:03.528
-Caroline!
-What?

31:03.528 --> 31:05.738
I get hungry
when I watch people bake.

31:05.738 --> 31:06.906
[laughing]

31:06.906 --> 31:09.367
Well, I'll see what I can do.

31:09.367 --> 31:11.202
Holly, can I speak to you
for just a moment?

31:11.202 --> 31:12.620
-Uh, yeah, sure.
-Oh, good.

31:12.620 --> 31:14.581
Listen.

31:14.581 --> 31:18.084
that was
a nice try today, but...

31:18.084 --> 31:19.752
you must remember

31:19.752 --> 31:22.255
that the secret
to holiday baking

31:22.255 --> 31:23.631
is the magic.

31:23.631 --> 31:25.800
It's easier said than done.

31:25.800 --> 31:27.260
Oh, there's nothing easy
about it.

31:27.260 --> 31:30.430
I have put a lifetime
into my baking.

31:30.430 --> 31:34.767
Oh! Some of my earlier cookies
were not even edible.

31:34.767 --> 31:36.102
I don't believe that.

31:36.102 --> 31:37.395
Oh, it's true!

31:37.395 --> 31:39.105
And I kept trying.

31:39.105 --> 31:41.733
Now, I know that this contest
is only a week long,

31:41.733 --> 31:43.276
but I have faith in you.

31:43.276 --> 31:45.278
You can find the magic.

31:45.278 --> 31:47.905
[stammering]
And what is that, exactly?

31:47.905 --> 31:49.782
I know you told Vera,
that if you had to ask...

31:49.782 --> 31:52.327
Ohh, she has been cooking
for a long time.

31:52.327 --> 31:54.287
She should know better
by now!

31:54.287 --> 31:56.623
But I will give you a hint.

31:57.624 --> 32:00.251
You have to find
that part of you

32:00.251 --> 32:03.713
that understands
the meaning of Christmas...

32:03.713 --> 32:08.676
and then you make that
into an ingredient.

32:10.303 --> 32:13.473
It's not
all about how the food looks.

32:13.473 --> 32:16.476
I know that I'm good
at making food look pretty,

32:16.476 --> 32:18.102
but, for the taste...

32:19.646 --> 32:21.648
I'll try harder tomorrow.

32:21.648 --> 32:23.149
[laughs] I know you will!

32:23.149 --> 32:24.901
I know you will.

32:25.902 --> 32:28.237
[♪♪♪]

32:29.697 --> 32:31.699
[sighs heavily]

32:31.699 --> 32:33.701
"Magic."

32:35.286 --> 32:36.371
I don't know
if I can

32:36.371 --> 32:38.414
get the hang
of this whole baking thing.

32:38.414 --> 32:39.540
Guess I take after Mom.

32:39.540 --> 32:40.667
And you.

32:40.667 --> 32:43.002
Hey! Don't include me
in your cookie capers.

32:43.002 --> 32:45.004
You know I'm more of

32:45.004 --> 32:47.632
a savory/spicy sauce
kinda gal.

32:47.632 --> 32:48.675
Well, I don't think

32:48.675 --> 32:51.469
barbecue-flavored cookies
are gonna cut it.

32:51.469 --> 32:53.012
Not at Christmastime.

32:53.012 --> 32:56.474
Fourth of July?
Now, that would be a hit.

32:57.642 --> 33:00.061
So, tell me why we're going
to the Madison again?

33:00.061 --> 33:01.354
I'm just curious.

33:01.354 --> 33:03.523
Oh, is that what you call it,
curiosity?

33:03.523 --> 33:06.192
Now, I thought we were
stalking the competition.

33:06.192 --> 33:07.860
Mm, I think you mean
"staking out."

33:07.860 --> 33:09.862
I'm pretty sure
I mean stalking.

33:09.862 --> 33:11.030
And are we?

33:11.030 --> 33:13.282
No. Brad won't even be there.

33:13.282 --> 33:15.827
Oh. Well, in that case,

33:15.827 --> 33:17.787
let's show you
the new-and-improved inn,

33:17.787 --> 33:20.206
without the handsome pastry chef
there to bother us.

33:20.206 --> 33:22.166
Now you sound like Mom.

33:22.166 --> 33:24.043
[Caroline chuckles]

33:24.043 --> 33:26.045
Do you think he's handsome?

33:26.045 --> 33:27.880
Well, what does it matter
what I think?

33:27.880 --> 33:29.257
-Oh, you're so right.
-Oh?

33:29.257 --> 33:32.051
It doesn't-- it doesn't matter.
Not a bit.

33:36.848 --> 33:38.641
I mean, I have to admit it.

33:38.641 --> 33:40.727
It's... nice.

33:40.727 --> 33:42.895
Mm-hmm. I mean, I know
how much you loved the old inn,

33:42.895 --> 33:44.480
and it had its charm,

33:44.480 --> 33:47.066
but this place is elegant,

33:47.066 --> 33:50.194
and Madison needed a place
for romantic nights.

33:50.194 --> 33:52.613
So, speaking of romance,
how is your love life?

33:52.613 --> 33:54.365
Mm.

33:54.365 --> 33:56.075
Ah, it didn't go so well
with, uh...

33:56.075 --> 33:57.660
Jasper? Jackson?

33:57.660 --> 33:59.704
-Jacob.
-Jacob, right.

33:59.704 --> 34:01.414
No, things didn't work out.

34:01.414 --> 34:05.585
And before you say it, yes,
I broke up with him.

34:05.585 --> 34:07.503
Because...?

34:07.503 --> 34:08.880
We want different things.

34:08.880 --> 34:12.717
I mean, I want a man who values
a family and a home life,

34:12.717 --> 34:13.926
and Jacob was a workaholic.

34:13.926 --> 34:14.969
[Caroline snickers]

34:16.012 --> 34:16.929
What?

34:16.929 --> 34:19.139
You are a workaholic,
sister, dear.

34:20.224 --> 34:22.101
I know how to take time off,

34:22.101 --> 34:23.436
like coming home for Christmas

34:23.436 --> 34:25.730
and spending quality time
with my sister.

34:25.730 --> 34:27.106
Mm. Fair point.

34:27.106 --> 34:29.984
But being alone in the big city
just sounds plain wrong.

34:29.984 --> 34:32.612
I don't need a boyfriend
to be happy.

34:32.612 --> 34:34.405
And while we're on the subject,

34:34.405 --> 34:36.491
are you still
pining over Marshall?

34:36.491 --> 34:37.492
I don't pine.

34:37.492 --> 34:38.451
-Mm.
-I don't!

34:38.451 --> 34:39.619
I mean, I cry once,

34:39.619 --> 34:41.996
delete, block,
and I move on.

34:41.996 --> 34:44.581
So... no one new?

34:44.581 --> 34:46.333
Not yet.

34:46.333 --> 34:48.293
But, come the New Year,

34:48.293 --> 34:50.254
I plan on downloading
a dating app

34:50.254 --> 34:52.130
and getting myself
back out there.

34:52.130 --> 34:53.257
Good for you.

34:53.257 --> 34:54.759
I can't do the online thing.

34:54.759 --> 34:58.262
Well, look, I get you've always
been career-oriented,

34:58.262 --> 35:00.014
but a little romance
goes a long way.

35:00.014 --> 35:02.141
I know,
and I will meet someone.

35:02.141 --> 35:03.267
The old-fashioned way.

35:03.267 --> 35:04.519
Eventually.

35:05.937 --> 35:07.271
Well, any news on that job?

35:07.271 --> 35:08.606
Not yet.

35:09.816 --> 35:13.986
Oh, does Mrs. Rose
bake mille-feuille?

35:13.986 --> 35:15.321
Definitely not.

35:15.321 --> 35:17.949
I guess we know what
Brad plans to do

35:17.949 --> 35:19.617
if he wins the competition.

35:19.617 --> 35:21.160
Well, why don't we ask him?

35:22.245 --> 35:24.997
[♪♪♪]

35:26.499 --> 35:28.251
Hey, Holly.

35:28.251 --> 35:29.335
Hi.

35:29.335 --> 35:30.837
This is a surprise.

35:30.837 --> 35:32.505
I didn't think
that you would be here.

35:32.505 --> 35:34.006
I work here.

35:34.006 --> 35:38.010
Yes, but I don't pastry chefs
keep early hours?

35:38.010 --> 35:40.721
We do. I adjusted my schedule
for the baking contest

35:40.721 --> 35:44.642
and I just popped by to check
on preparations for tomorrow.

35:44.642 --> 35:46.018
I'm Caroline, Holly's sister.

35:46.018 --> 35:48.271
Oh, sorry.
I should have introduced you.

35:48.271 --> 35:49.730
[chuckles] Brad Beauchamp.

35:49.730 --> 35:51.899
You're Holly's
main competition.

35:53.192 --> 35:55.695
Well, uh, enjoy your pastries,

35:55.695 --> 35:57.238
even if they're not one
of Mrs. Rose's

35:57.238 --> 35:58.906
12 Days of Christmas
confections.

36:07.582 --> 36:09.500
So, are you sure

36:09.500 --> 36:12.003
there's nothing going on
between you and Brad?

36:13.045 --> 36:14.088
Positive.

36:14.088 --> 36:16.048
I mean, no doubt
he's just another workaholic

36:16.048 --> 36:18.551
that doesn't want to sacrifice
his ambitions for family.

36:18.551 --> 36:22.054
He probably grew up
with a rich family in Palm Beach

36:22.054 --> 36:24.223
and went to some fancy school
in Paris.

36:24.223 --> 36:25.766
Now, it's a shame,

36:25.766 --> 36:28.686
'cause Christmas is
the most romantic time of year.

36:28.686 --> 36:31.689
The only present I want
this year is the bakery.

36:31.689 --> 36:33.024
And you'd really give up

36:33.024 --> 36:35.026
your work and your life
in New York to run it?

36:35.026 --> 36:36.068
If you're asking me

36:36.068 --> 36:38.029
if I've thought this
all the way through...

36:38.029 --> 36:39.071
I am.

36:39.071 --> 36:41.157
Not really.

36:41.157 --> 36:43.159
You know, Mrs. Rose would be
very upset if you won

36:43.159 --> 36:44.243
and then, I don't know,

36:44.243 --> 36:45.661
let her lifelong dream
go out of business

36:45.661 --> 36:48.080
just because you want
to be in Manhattan.

36:48.080 --> 36:49.248
That would never happen.

36:49.248 --> 36:50.958
Because you'd let Brad
do the baking?

36:50.958 --> 36:52.418
[both laughing]

36:52.418 --> 36:54.545
I mean, I think we both know

36:54.545 --> 36:56.422
that my winning
is a long shot.

36:56.422 --> 36:59.216
Remember,
I can't actually bake.

36:59.216 --> 37:00.259
Yeah.

37:00.259 --> 37:02.094
Hey. Holly. Caroline.

37:02.094 --> 37:03.262
Mind if I join you?

37:03.262 --> 37:04.347
No, not at all.

37:04.347 --> 37:05.681
I'm heading out.

37:05.681 --> 37:08.059
All this watching you
bake your heart out

37:08.059 --> 37:09.435
has exhausted me,

37:09.435 --> 37:10.519
so good luck tomorrow, Holly.

37:10.519 --> 37:12.313
And be kind to my sister.

37:12.313 --> 37:13.606
Always.

37:13.606 --> 37:14.774
Happy Christmas.

37:14.774 --> 37:15.983
Oh, Happy Christmas.

37:15.983 --> 37:19.111
It's good to see everybody
so full of holiday cheer.

37:19.111 --> 37:21.239
Thank you...
for the wine.

37:21.239 --> 37:23.240
[clink]

37:25.159 --> 37:26.994
I hope you win the contest.

37:26.994 --> 37:29.205
It would be awesome
having you move back to Madison.

37:29.205 --> 37:31.123
That's lovely, Loretta,

37:31.123 --> 37:33.334
but we both know
that's unlikely.

37:33.334 --> 37:35.378
I'm surprised you didn't
enter the competition.

37:35.378 --> 37:38.506
You must be quite the baker
after all these years.

37:38.506 --> 37:40.591
Mrs. Rose has
taught me a lot, for sure,

37:40.591 --> 37:42.301
but running a small business?

37:42.301 --> 37:43.803
I don't think I'd enjoy that.

37:43.803 --> 37:46.138
I prefer to be
at the front of the shop,

37:46.138 --> 37:47.264
serving customers,

37:47.264 --> 37:48.683
seeing how much
they enjoy the food.

37:48.683 --> 37:50.685
That really makes me happy.

37:50.685 --> 37:52.645
You're lucky you know
what makes you happy.

37:52.645 --> 37:53.938
Most people don't.

37:53.938 --> 37:54.939
Do you?

37:54.939 --> 37:58.442
Of course.
I love my job.

37:58.442 --> 38:00.319
Then we're both lucky.

38:00.319 --> 38:01.612
Yes, we are.

38:01.612 --> 38:02.571
[clink]

38:06.826 --> 38:08.661
Can I ask you
for some dating advice?

38:08.661 --> 38:09.620
Ahem.

38:09.620 --> 38:13.040
Uh, I'm not exactly
a dating expert,

38:13.040 --> 38:15.835
but, um, go ahead.

38:15.835 --> 38:17.837
Have you ever asked a man out?

38:17.837 --> 38:19.588
No. Wait!

38:19.588 --> 38:20.631
Yes.

38:20.631 --> 38:22.216
Once. In college.

38:22.216 --> 38:23.467
Did he say yes?

38:23.467 --> 38:26.262
No. He had a girlfriend.

38:29.140 --> 38:30.850
Loretta...

38:30.850 --> 38:33.185
You've liked Carson
since high school.

38:33.185 --> 38:35.521
I can't believe
you haven't asked him out yet.

38:35.521 --> 38:36.981
Is it that obvious?

38:36.981 --> 38:38.024
Mm-hmm.

38:38.024 --> 38:39.817
I've tried. Sort of.

38:39.817 --> 38:41.902
I mean, I don't think
he even knows I exist,

38:41.902 --> 38:44.196
even though I've worked at
the bakery all these years.

38:44.196 --> 38:45.990
Well, then
maybe now is perfect.

38:45.990 --> 38:47.533
People keep telling me
that Christmas

38:47.533 --> 38:49.535
is the most romantic time
of the year.

38:49.535 --> 38:51.370
I don't think I'd be able
to handle the rejection

38:51.370 --> 38:52.830
if he said no.

38:52.830 --> 38:53.873
He won't.

38:53.873 --> 38:56.208
I mean, you're--
You're adorable.

38:56.208 --> 38:57.543
You're smart.

38:57.543 --> 38:59.170
You're kind.

38:59.170 --> 39:00.379
And...

39:00.379 --> 39:03.215
his mother already
approves of you.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.010
Have you, uh, told his mom
about your feelings?

39:06.010 --> 39:08.512
No. Why?

39:08.512 --> 39:10.556
She is the person
who knows him best

39:10.556 --> 39:13.267
and she might be
quite helpful.

39:14.435 --> 39:16.645
[♪♪♪]

39:19.231 --> 39:20.232
Bye.

39:20.232 --> 39:21.358
Heading home so soon?

39:21.358 --> 39:23.069
I've got to get
a good night's sleep

39:23.069 --> 39:24.945
if I'm gonna
kick your butt tomorrow.

39:24.945 --> 39:26.030
Oh, ho, ho, ho.

39:26.030 --> 39:28.282
Well, I doubt the recipe
will be mille-feuille.

39:28.282 --> 39:30.409
Are you seriously telling me
you don't know

39:30.409 --> 39:31.869
what the 12 desserts
of Christmas are?

39:31.869 --> 39:33.871
Of course I know what they are.
I was teasing.

39:35.247 --> 39:36.415
Hey, do you have a minute?

39:36.415 --> 39:37.750
Let me show you something.

39:37.750 --> 39:39.251
Uh... sure.

39:47.051 --> 39:48.094
It's beautiful.

39:48.094 --> 39:49.970
Like a snowy mountain.

39:51.055 --> 39:52.556
What is it?

39:52.556 --> 39:54.225
It's a pavlova.

39:54.225 --> 39:56.769
Prior to today,
I had never heard of it,

39:56.769 --> 39:58.604
but there's an Australian family

39:58.604 --> 40:00.397
staying with us
at the inn right now,

40:00.397 --> 40:02.108
and they requested it
for Christmas dinner.

40:02.108 --> 40:04.485
Apparently, it's a holiday
tradition Down Under.

40:04.485 --> 40:07.196
Oh, before you go,
I have something for you.

40:15.788 --> 40:17.081
What is it?

40:17.081 --> 40:19.792
It's the remainder of
the mille-feuille I made today.

40:19.792 --> 40:21.836
I saw how much you liked it.

40:22.920 --> 40:24.004
Thank you.

40:24.004 --> 40:27.007
Yeah, I know
it's not a "Mrs. Rose" special,

40:27.007 --> 40:29.635
but it's pretty darn good
with morning coffee.

40:30.761 --> 40:33.180
Well, I'm sure they'll love it.

40:33.180 --> 40:35.432
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.812
This is really nice, Mom.

40:39.812 --> 40:41.438
We don't get to do this
all that often.

40:41.438 --> 40:43.816
So, how does
shopping in Madison

40:43.816 --> 40:45.609
compare to New York?

40:45.609 --> 40:48.320
Uh... less crowds.

40:48.320 --> 40:49.822
More families.

40:49.822 --> 40:51.824
Cute local businesses.

40:51.824 --> 40:55.161
In other words,
it's, uh, it's more fun.

40:55.161 --> 40:56.620
[chuckles]
Careful, Holly.

40:56.620 --> 40:59.582
You're starting to sound
like you miss it here.

41:03.544 --> 41:04.753
Hi, Brad!

41:04.753 --> 41:06.172
Hey!

41:06.172 --> 41:07.339
Doing a little shopping?

41:07.339 --> 41:08.340
Oh, I'm done shopping.

41:08.340 --> 41:09.383
Oh, Holly mentioned

41:09.383 --> 41:11.510
that you showed her
a pavlova you made.

41:11.510 --> 41:12.511
Did she?

41:12.511 --> 41:14.597
Ooh, it sounds spectacular.

41:14.597 --> 41:16.307
Now, if you'll excuse me,

41:16.307 --> 41:18.017
I'm gonna head home
and I'm gonna

41:18.017 --> 41:19.435
let you two
discuss the contest.

41:22.021 --> 41:23.022
So,

41:23.022 --> 41:24.982
any other presents to buy?

41:24.982 --> 41:26.817
Uh, no, I'm all done.

41:26.817 --> 41:29.820
Ah. I'm actually contemplating
buying this scarf.

41:29.820 --> 41:30.988
[snickers]

41:30.988 --> 41:33.115
It looks, uh... warm.

41:33.115 --> 41:35.117
Well, it's my first Christmas
outside of Florida,

41:35.117 --> 41:37.369
so I think I need warm.

41:37.369 --> 41:38.204
Mm.

41:38.204 --> 41:39.663
-It's warm, you know...
-Yeah.

41:39.663 --> 41:40.831
But is it fashionable?

41:40.831 --> 41:42.500
You're from New York,
right, so, thoughts?

41:42.500 --> 41:45.211
I mean, that scarf
is all the rage in Manhattan.

41:45.211 --> 41:47.004
-Done. Buying it.
-No, no, no!

41:47.004 --> 41:48.547
I was just kidding.

41:48.547 --> 41:50.216
New Yorkers
do not kid about fashion.

41:50.216 --> 41:51.967
I'm not a New Yorker.
I'm a local girl.

41:51.967 --> 41:53.177
Okay, well, local girl,

41:53.177 --> 41:55.179
it's too late,
I'm buying it, it's mine.

41:55.179 --> 41:56.472
Uh, Brad?

41:56.472 --> 41:57.348
Yeah?

41:57.348 --> 41:58.557
We're really late.

41:58.557 --> 41:59.516
Oh, shoot!

41:59.516 --> 42:00.684
-I'm gonna go pay for this.
-Okay.

42:00.684 --> 42:02.561
-Yeah.
-[laughs] Okay.

42:02.561 --> 42:04.063
[Brad] I love this scarf!

42:16.784 --> 42:17.910
Hmm.

42:17.910 --> 42:19.912
Sticky Toffee Pudding!

42:19.912 --> 42:20.996
-Yes!
-You're excited.

42:20.996 --> 42:22.748
It's my favorite.

42:23.832 --> 42:26.710
[♪♪♪]

42:39.139 --> 42:41.600
[♪♪♪]

42:53.779 --> 42:56.448
[♪♪♪]

42:56.448 --> 42:59.285
I've never had
sticky toffee pudding.

42:59.285 --> 43:00.911
[scoffs] What?

43:00.911 --> 43:02.454
You've worked here
all these years

43:02.454 --> 43:04.081
and you've never tried it?

43:04.081 --> 43:05.874
It's a 12 Days of Christmas
classic.

43:05.874 --> 43:07.251
Crazy, right?

43:07.251 --> 43:09.461
It's never appealed to me.
I think it's the name.

43:09.461 --> 43:11.380
What's it taste like?

43:11.380 --> 43:12.881
Sticky toffee.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.263
[♪♪♪]

43:23.851 --> 43:24.810
Here.

43:24.810 --> 43:25.978
You should try some
of the good stuff

43:25.978 --> 43:27.938
before you judge the rest.

43:31.859 --> 43:33.319
It's good, right?

43:33.319 --> 43:35.487
It's amazing.

43:35.487 --> 43:37.031
[chuckles]

43:37.031 --> 43:39.116
Um...

43:39.116 --> 43:40.159
Carson,

43:40.159 --> 43:41.702
can I ask you something?

43:41.702 --> 43:43.662
Yeah, yeah.
What is it?

43:46.999 --> 43:49.710
Who do you think,
um, will win?

43:49.710 --> 43:51.003
No one.

43:51.003 --> 43:54.131
I mean, none of these people
can touch my mother's baking.

43:54.131 --> 43:56.634
With her gone,
the shop's better off closing.

43:56.634 --> 43:59.094
You don't really
think that, do you?

43:59.094 --> 44:00.846
It's the end of an era.

44:00.846 --> 44:02.014
[phone rings]

44:02.014 --> 44:04.058
I've gotta get this.

44:05.851 --> 44:08.479
Okay, ladies and Brad,

44:08.479 --> 44:10.606
time to put those puddin's
in the oven.

44:16.862 --> 44:19.323
[♪♪♪]

44:29.083 --> 44:31.543
Oh... there's something
on your face there.

44:32.544 --> 44:34.880
Yeah, just a little higher.

44:34.880 --> 44:37.049
Ah, just the top of--

44:37.049 --> 44:38.217
Actually, can I--?

44:38.217 --> 44:40.219
Yeah. Thanks.

44:45.391 --> 44:49.019
[♪♪♪]

44:49.019 --> 44:50.270
Got it.

44:50.270 --> 44:52.022
Thanks.

44:55.901 --> 44:57.736
Could you step forward, Holly?

45:01.865 --> 45:02.991
Eight.

45:04.368 --> 45:05.994
Eight and a half.

45:05.994 --> 45:07.079
[Carson] Wow.

45:07.079 --> 45:08.539
Your pudding seems to be

45:08.539 --> 45:10.749
a favorite with my mom
and Loretta,

45:10.749 --> 45:13.085
but it just didn't do it for me.

45:13.085 --> 45:15.087
-Not sticky enough?
-[Carson chuckles]

45:15.087 --> 45:17.339
It just didn't taste right.

45:17.339 --> 45:19.633
I'm not feeling the magic.

45:20.926 --> 45:22.719
Holly, I'm giving you a four.

45:24.721 --> 45:27.099
[Loretta]
Let me add up the scores.

45:27.099 --> 45:29.476
[♪♪♪]

45:29.476 --> 45:31.937
Congratulations, Holly.

45:31.937 --> 45:34.440
You have survived another round!

45:34.440 --> 45:37.609
-Thank you and enjoy!
-Sorry.

45:37.609 --> 45:39.778
[all applauding]

45:40.779 --> 45:42.990
Hey. Congrats.

45:44.116 --> 45:45.284
Thank you.

45:45.284 --> 45:46.827
Brad, Holly--

45:46.827 --> 45:50.080
would you mind staying
and cleaning together?

45:50.080 --> 45:52.291
Two sets of hands
make for light work.

45:52.291 --> 45:54.001
Uh, yeah, sure.

45:54.001 --> 45:56.336
[Mrs. Rose] Oh, good.
Thank you.

45:56.336 --> 45:58.672
Delicious.
How could you give her a four?

45:58.672 --> 46:00.299
-It's so good.
-She still made it through.

46:00.299 --> 46:01.300
She's got another chance.

46:05.762 --> 46:08.474
[Holly] Hey!

46:08.474 --> 46:11.810
Mm! This is delicious.

46:16.190 --> 46:17.816
Oh, wow!

46:17.816 --> 46:19.818
I don't think I'd be able
to tell the difference

46:19.818 --> 46:21.487
between yours and Mrs. Rose's.

46:21.487 --> 46:23.530
Yeah, but yours
is beautiful.

46:23.530 --> 46:26.950
Mine looks like sticky mud.

46:26.950 --> 46:29.828
Ah, a little bit.

46:29.828 --> 46:32.998
I think I need to work on
my decorating skills.

46:32.998 --> 46:34.958
Mm-mm.
Just takes practice.

46:37.044 --> 46:39.379
Until tomorrow.

46:39.379 --> 46:41.465
Actually, I was wondering
if you wouldn't mind

46:41.465 --> 46:44.176
giving me
a holiday tour of Madison?

46:44.176 --> 46:45.594
Holiday tour?

46:45.594 --> 46:48.847
Yeah. Yeah,
you're the local girl, right?

46:48.847 --> 46:50.807
Show me
the Christmas sights.

46:51.767 --> 46:53.769
All right.
You're on.

46:53.769 --> 46:55.562
Okay.

46:57.272 --> 46:58.690
So have you heard about

46:58.690 --> 47:00.526
"Winter Storm Megan"
that's coming in?

47:00.526 --> 47:04.196
Yeah, it's supposed to be
the biggest blizzard on record.

47:04.196 --> 47:06.907
Ooh. I love snowstorms.

47:06.907 --> 47:08.242
Really?

47:08.242 --> 47:09.993
What do you love about them?

47:11.161 --> 47:13.747
Something about the way
the snow whirls and twirls

47:13.747 --> 47:17.501
and coats everything in
this cottony blanket of white,

47:17.501 --> 47:19.461
like a frozen cloud.

47:19.461 --> 47:20.879
And even though
there's wind,

47:20.879 --> 47:23.382
there's this silence

47:23.382 --> 47:25.551
that's so serene.

47:25.551 --> 47:27.594
You make it sound
so beautiful.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.764
Well, if it does happen,
this will be my first.

47:30.764 --> 47:32.766
[gasps] I'm so jealous!

47:32.766 --> 47:35.143
It's your first time
experiencing it?

47:35.143 --> 47:36.228
[laughs]

47:36.228 --> 47:37.229
Well, given my luck,

47:37.229 --> 47:38.897
I'll probably be
stuck on the turnpike

47:38.897 --> 47:41.400
instead of tucked away
by a cozy fire.

47:41.400 --> 47:43.193
Well, just keep
an eye on the weather.

47:43.193 --> 47:45.112
Maybe you'll be lucky.

47:45.112 --> 47:47.114
[Brad chuckles]

47:48.407 --> 47:51.910
A local artist brings these
every year.

47:51.910 --> 47:53.620
They're so beautiful.

47:53.620 --> 47:55.539
Mm.

47:55.539 --> 47:57.416
Which one's your favorite?

47:57.416 --> 47:59.251
I love this one.

47:59.251 --> 48:00.877
Mm. Excuse me?

48:00.877 --> 48:02.838
Can I take one of these?

48:03.922 --> 48:05.424
Thanks.

48:06.466 --> 48:08.218
Merry Christmas.

48:09.428 --> 48:11.221
So, have you set up a tree yet?

48:11.221 --> 48:12.889
I'm working on it.

48:12.889 --> 48:14.224
Oh, you better get on that.

48:14.224 --> 48:16.893
Yes, ma'am.

48:19.605 --> 48:21.106
Mm. Thank you.

48:21.106 --> 48:22.274
Wanna go through the gardens?

48:22.274 --> 48:23.400
Yes!

48:23.400 --> 48:25.569
They're beautiful
this time of year.

48:25.569 --> 48:26.903
Oh, yeah?

48:30.032 --> 48:32.451
So how was
Christmas in Florida?

48:32.451 --> 48:34.620
Hot and humid.

48:34.620 --> 48:35.871
But very festive.

48:35.871 --> 48:36.913
Yeah.

48:36.913 --> 48:39.124
We know how to celebrate,
that's for sure.

48:39.124 --> 48:40.667
Mm-hmm.

48:40.667 --> 48:43.420
Hey, why do you
want the bakery so badly?

48:43.420 --> 48:46.298
Um...

48:46.298 --> 48:48.342
For my memories.

48:48.342 --> 48:50.427
My childhood.

48:53.055 --> 48:57.142
You know, I worked at the shop
all through school.

48:57.142 --> 48:59.728
And there's a lot of love there.

48:59.728 --> 49:01.271
And the baking,

49:01.271 --> 49:02.981
and the happiness
it brings people...

49:02.981 --> 49:04.608
It's magic.

49:05.651 --> 49:07.986
All that time I spent

49:07.986 --> 49:10.947
with helping Mrs. Rose
decorate cakes and cookies

49:10.947 --> 49:14.034
is what inspired me
to become a food stylist.

49:15.118 --> 49:18.121
I suppose
I'm just afraid

49:18.121 --> 49:19.414
that if the bakery closes,

49:19.414 --> 49:21.333
I'll lose
that part of myself, too.

49:21.333 --> 49:23.043
Hmm.

49:23.043 --> 49:26.546
But would you really be happy
as a small-town business owner?

49:28.799 --> 49:30.676
Honestly?

49:30.676 --> 49:34.805
I think I would be happier
running the bakery in Madison

49:34.805 --> 49:36.473
than I am in New York.

49:36.473 --> 49:39.893
So, yes, I would be happy
in the bakeshop.

49:39.893 --> 49:41.228
You wouldn't miss

49:41.228 --> 49:43.522
all those stylish
Manhattan friends

49:43.522 --> 49:45.023
if you stayed here?

49:45.023 --> 49:46.692
See, I love New York.

49:46.692 --> 49:47.859
I do.

49:47.859 --> 49:49.027
I love my work.

49:49.027 --> 49:52.030
But being close
to friends and family

49:52.030 --> 49:54.991
and the places you love,
doing the things you love,

49:54.991 --> 49:56.868
nothing can beat it.

49:56.868 --> 49:59.329
The contest has shown me that.

49:59.329 --> 50:01.623
Well, I guess we both
really want to win then.

50:01.623 --> 50:03.041
We do...

50:03.041 --> 50:04.209
but it's a moot point.

50:04.209 --> 50:05.335
Why's that?

50:05.335 --> 50:07.921
[snickers]
You're the star baker!

50:07.921 --> 50:10.549
I was second
from the bottom today.

50:10.549 --> 50:14.594
Winning the bakery
is a fantasy for me.

50:16.054 --> 50:17.055
Hmm.

50:17.055 --> 50:18.557
I mean, realistically,

50:18.557 --> 50:21.268
I'll go back to New York
and to my job,

50:21.268 --> 50:24.563
and you will be the new owner
of Mrs. Rose's Bakery.

50:24.563 --> 50:26.898
Well, not if Carson has
anything to say about it.

50:26.898 --> 50:28.567
I don't think even Carson

50:28.567 --> 50:29.526
would be able to tell
the difference

50:29.526 --> 50:31.653
between your baking
and his mom's.

50:31.653 --> 50:33.363
-Wow.
-Mm?

50:33.363 --> 50:35.282
-Now, that is a compliment.
-I know, right?

50:35.282 --> 50:37.200
[laughs]

50:38.535 --> 50:39.786
[inhales sharply]

50:39.786 --> 50:40.787
Ooh, it's cold.

50:40.787 --> 50:41.580
Yeah.

50:41.580 --> 50:42.789
Let's get a move-on?

50:42.789 --> 50:44.750
-Yeah, let's go.
-Okay.

50:50.589 --> 50:52.257
[Holly] So, this is me.

50:52.257 --> 50:55.260
[Brad]
What a lovely place to grow up.

50:56.303 --> 50:57.345
Hey, thanks for showing me

50:57.345 --> 50:59.306
what a Madison Christmas
is all about.

50:59.306 --> 51:02.476
[Holly] And thank you
for walking me home.

51:02.476 --> 51:04.770
And thank you
for indulging my gallantry.

51:04.770 --> 51:07.022
[both laughing]

51:11.777 --> 51:13.612
Until tomorrow.

51:14.696 --> 51:16.448
-Goodnight.
-Goodnight.

51:18.492 --> 51:21.119
[♪♪♪]

51:33.173 --> 51:37.010
[♪♪♪]

51:37.010 --> 51:38.553
Holly?

51:38.553 --> 51:41.056
What are you doing
here so early?

51:42.015 --> 51:44.267
What are you
doing here so early?

51:44.267 --> 51:46.144
I just came to practice
my decorating skills.

51:46.144 --> 51:47.395
Why are you decorating?

51:47.395 --> 51:48.814
Do you know
what the next dessert is?

51:48.814 --> 51:50.357
What do you think
it's gonna be?

51:51.942 --> 51:53.944
Maybe one of the cookies.

51:53.944 --> 51:55.987
I was practicing on my baking.

51:55.987 --> 51:57.739
Cookies, huh?

51:57.739 --> 51:58.949
Which ones?

51:58.949 --> 52:01.326
You'll have to wait
and find out.

52:04.746 --> 52:06.331
Okay.

52:07.499 --> 52:10.335
[♪♪♪]

52:21.054 --> 52:23.515
[♪♪♪]

52:39.531 --> 52:42.033
[♪♪♪]

52:50.876 --> 52:52.669
Enjoy!

52:52.669 --> 52:55.422
[all applauding]

52:57.549 --> 52:59.551
Ooh.

52:59.551 --> 53:03.305
Today, we sent
another contestant home,

53:03.305 --> 53:05.432
leaving you four finalists.

53:06.516 --> 53:08.935
Only three recipes left

53:08.935 --> 53:12.272
and we will
announce the winner.

53:12.272 --> 53:14.357
After I do
the final taste test.

53:14.357 --> 53:18.278
Well, Christian and I
came up with a little twist.

53:19.279 --> 53:22.198
Whoever the last baker is

53:22.198 --> 53:25.076
will place their dessert
next to mine.

53:25.076 --> 53:27.662
We will blindfold Carson

53:27.662 --> 53:30.498
and then he will do
his final taste test.

53:30.498 --> 53:32.250
My dear,

53:32.250 --> 53:34.836
if you pick my baking
over the winner,

53:34.836 --> 53:38.340
then we will sell the bakery,

53:38.340 --> 53:41.009
but if you pick
the winner over mine,

53:41.009 --> 53:43.303
then they will have won
the bakery,

53:43.303 --> 53:44.721
fair and square.

53:44.721 --> 53:45.931
[Mrs. Rose giggles]

53:45.931 --> 53:47.390
Challenge accepted.

53:47.390 --> 53:48.725
Oh! Good!

53:48.725 --> 53:49.601
Wonderful!

53:49.601 --> 53:50.602
I knew you'd understand.

53:50.602 --> 53:51.937
Okay, back to work!

53:51.937 --> 53:53.271
Back to work!

53:53.271 --> 53:55.148
[Mrs. Rose giggling]

53:56.024 --> 53:58.318
You thinking
what I'm thinking, Mom?

53:58.318 --> 54:00.528
Oh, I'm way ahead of you,
daughter.

54:00.528 --> 54:02.906
Congrats to you both.

54:02.906 --> 54:04.115
-Thanks, Mom.
-Thank you.

54:04.115 --> 54:05.951
Uh, Brad, I was wondering
if you'd like

54:05.951 --> 54:07.577
to join our family
this evening.

54:07.577 --> 54:09.746
We're gonna finish trimming
the Christmas tree.

54:09.746 --> 54:10.705
I'm sure Brad's busy.

54:10.705 --> 54:12.582
No, I would--
I would love to.

54:12.582 --> 54:13.875
Wonderful!

54:13.875 --> 54:15.460
Oh, and don't forget
to bring your cookies--

54:15.460 --> 54:16.544
both of you--

54:16.544 --> 54:20.465
so I can serve them
while we decorate.

54:21.424 --> 54:24.302
Okay, Mom, let's go.

54:24.302 --> 54:25.720
I guess we'd better
get cleaned up then.

54:25.720 --> 54:27.973
Yeah.

54:32.352 --> 54:34.312
I'm not a baker, but...

54:34.312 --> 54:35.730
she really is improving.

54:35.730 --> 54:37.107
Well, she really wants to win.

54:37.107 --> 54:38.483
Well, she won't.

54:38.483 --> 54:39.943
Well, we can't be sure.

54:39.943 --> 54:41.152
[chuckles] Oh, Brad.

54:41.152 --> 54:42.487
You're a gentleman,

54:42.487 --> 54:44.572
but you're clearly
the frontrunner.

54:44.572 --> 54:46.032
All we ask

54:46.032 --> 54:49.119
is that you continue
the 12 Days of Christmas baking

54:49.119 --> 54:50.745
when you own the place.

54:50.745 --> 54:52.747
I promise.

54:53.832 --> 54:55.417
Is that Holly?

54:55.417 --> 54:57.627
Yeah.

54:57.627 --> 55:00.046
Aw. Wasn't she adorable?

55:00.046 --> 55:01.840
She is. I mean...

55:01.840 --> 55:03.174
was.

55:03.174 --> 55:04.467
[Holly] Mom.

55:04.467 --> 55:05.468
[footsteps]

55:05.468 --> 55:08.138
Why are you showing Brad
baby photos of me?

55:08.138 --> 55:09.472
Because you're adorable.

55:09.472 --> 55:10.974
Your mom didn't
show it to me.

55:10.974 --> 55:12.183
I saw it.

55:12.183 --> 55:14.477
You really were adorable,
by the way.

55:14.477 --> 55:18.231
Thanks. Uh, why don't we finish
trimming the Christmas tree?

55:19.315 --> 55:22.193
[♪♪♪]

55:24.571 --> 55:25.864
[all chatting]

55:25.864 --> 55:28.950
Okay, so, I didn't expect
to make it to the final four,

55:28.950 --> 55:30.118
but I have a feeling
that these cookies

55:30.118 --> 55:31.703
are going to be really good.

55:32.704 --> 55:34.289
Thanks, sweetie.

55:34.289 --> 55:35.498
-Let's have some.
-All right.

55:35.498 --> 55:36.541
Mm.

55:39.044 --> 55:42.130
Oh, did you put
an egg in again?

55:42.130 --> 55:45.050
You know what, it has really,
really good crunch, dear.

55:45.050 --> 55:46.051
Mm-hmm. Crunch.

55:46.051 --> 55:48.053
Okay, well, try one of Brad's.

55:48.053 --> 55:49.721
It's not so bad, I mean...

55:50.972 --> 55:52.891
-Thanks, honey.
-Thanks.

55:54.893 --> 55:57.312
Oh...
Now, that's a Christmas cookie.

55:57.312 --> 55:58.354
Mm-hmm.

55:58.354 --> 55:59.814
Oh, that's good.

55:59.814 --> 56:01.733
-Your classic shortbread.
-That's really good.

56:01.733 --> 56:03.902
It's just shortbread, guys,
it's nothing special.

56:03.902 --> 56:05.236
-Melts in your mouth.
-Mm-hmm.

56:05.236 --> 56:06.988
Thanks.
Thanks, guys.

56:06.988 --> 56:07.989
Thanks.

56:07.989 --> 56:09.074
Holly!

56:10.492 --> 56:11.618
Excuse me.

56:13.578 --> 56:15.663
Oh, so good!

56:15.663 --> 56:17.665
We have to be nicer to her.

56:20.585 --> 56:22.253
Hey.

56:22.253 --> 56:23.755
Sorry about that.

56:23.755 --> 56:25.215
I, uh, didn't mean to--

56:25.215 --> 56:26.257
No, it's-- it's fine.

56:26.257 --> 56:28.426
Just my sister
and my dad and...

56:28.426 --> 56:29.511
Yeah, I get it.

56:29.511 --> 56:31.346
Family during the holidays,
right?

56:31.346 --> 56:33.098
Yeah.

56:34.349 --> 56:35.517
Um...

56:35.517 --> 56:37.685
Please, sit.

56:39.604 --> 56:40.939
[Brad shivers]

56:42.107 --> 56:44.359
Speaking of family...

56:44.359 --> 56:46.111
the competition's
on Christmas Eve.

56:46.111 --> 56:47.987
What about Christmas Day?

56:47.987 --> 56:50.448
Are you going to catch
a flight to Florida?

56:50.448 --> 56:51.658
Yeah, I thought about it.

56:51.658 --> 56:52.951
Briefly.

56:52.951 --> 56:56.037
But, um, I don't have a lot
of family left in Fort Myers,

56:56.037 --> 56:59.249
so, uh, thought it would be nice
to have a white Christmas,

56:59.249 --> 57:00.291
for once.

57:00.291 --> 57:02.252
[laughs] That's funny.

57:02.252 --> 57:05.505
When you live north,
you go south for the winter,

57:05.505 --> 57:07.632
and you want to stay
for the deep freeze.

57:07.632 --> 57:08.967
[laughs] Yeah.

57:08.967 --> 57:11.302
I like to go against the grain
a little bit.

57:11.302 --> 57:13.680
Makes life more exciting.

57:14.764 --> 57:16.307
Can I ask you something?

57:16.307 --> 57:17.642
Yeah. Anything.

57:17.642 --> 57:20.311
You have to be completely
honest with me.

57:20.311 --> 57:23.189
That's all I'll ever be
with you, Holly.

57:25.525 --> 57:27.443
If I'm so bad,

57:27.443 --> 57:29.237
how did I make it
to the top four?

57:29.237 --> 57:32.157
I mean, was everybody else
just worse than me, or...?

57:34.826 --> 57:36.119
Okay, I get it.

57:36.119 --> 57:38.454
I'm not good
but I'm not <i> the worst.</i>

57:38.454 --> 57:40.081
Yet.

57:40.081 --> 57:42.333
You want honesty, right?

57:42.333 --> 57:43.543
Yes, please.

57:46.171 --> 57:48.173
You need to put
more emotion into it.

57:49.799 --> 57:52.343
But I thought baking
was just chemistry.

57:52.343 --> 57:54.929
Follow a recipe perfectly,

57:54.929 --> 57:56.347
and then
you decorate it perfectly,

57:56.347 --> 57:58.683
and it turns out perfect?

57:58.683 --> 57:59.934
You're forgetting

57:59.934 --> 58:02.061
the third category
Mrs. Rose mentioned.

58:03.146 --> 58:05.064
The magic.

58:05.064 --> 58:07.108
Yeah.

58:07.108 --> 58:08.860
How you feel
about the bakeshop,

58:08.860 --> 58:12.363
all those reasons you told me
you wanted to win...

58:12.363 --> 58:13.865
that needs to be added
to the mix

58:13.865 --> 58:15.867
of everything you're making.

58:19.746 --> 58:21.372
Hey, do you think
your parents would mind

58:21.372 --> 58:23.208
if we got out of here
for a little bit?

58:24.500 --> 58:27.128
I don't think
they'd mind at all.

58:27.128 --> 58:28.922
All right, let's go.

58:29.964 --> 58:31.716
Come on, let's go.

58:37.847 --> 58:39.515
Okay, now you gotta--
you gotta stir the batter.

58:39.515 --> 58:42.018
That's it,
only put some heart into it.

58:42.018 --> 58:43.811
[laughing]

58:43.811 --> 58:45.271
-All right.
-There you go. Okay. Now.

58:45.271 --> 58:47.523
Smell the nutmeg. Mm?

58:47.523 --> 58:48.942
Mm!

58:48.942 --> 58:50.652
Mm-hmm.

58:50.652 --> 58:53.029
Now, instead
of looking at the recipe,

58:53.029 --> 58:54.572
I want you to feel it,

58:54.572 --> 58:56.074
and then decide
how much nutmeg to put in,

58:56.074 --> 58:57.909
and then taste the batter.

58:57.909 --> 58:59.744
[chuckles uneasily] Okay.

58:59.744 --> 59:01.663
Uh...

59:01.663 --> 59:03.248
that's it.

59:03.248 --> 59:04.374
Too much?

59:04.374 --> 59:06.459
[laughs] Well, don't ask!

59:06.459 --> 59:07.669
You gotta feel it, taste it.

59:07.669 --> 59:10.255
Okay, okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay.

59:13.341 --> 59:14.842
I think it needs more?

59:14.842 --> 59:16.135
Don't ask.

59:16.135 --> 59:17.595
Feel. Taste.

59:17.595 --> 59:19.222
[uneasily] Mm...

59:23.017 --> 59:24.352
I think that's enough.

59:24.352 --> 59:26.396
All right.

59:26.396 --> 59:29.107
Stir it in good.

59:29.107 --> 59:30.566
-Okay.
-Yeah.

59:32.360 --> 59:33.444
I think it's good!

59:33.444 --> 59:34.612
Perfect.

59:34.612 --> 59:36.281
Mm-kay. Let's pour it in.

59:36.281 --> 59:37.573
Let's do this.

59:37.573 --> 59:39.867
Okay.

59:39.867 --> 59:41.577
Yeah, that's it.

59:41.577 --> 59:43.788
Beautiful.

59:43.788 --> 59:44.872
Nice.

59:44.872 --> 59:46.249
Bailey's?

59:46.249 --> 59:48.626
[Holly] Yes, please.

59:59.470 --> 01:00:02.473
I can't believe this cheesecake
turned out so good.

01:00:02.473 --> 01:00:03.641
You were right.

01:00:04.851 --> 01:00:05.977
[clink]

01:00:11.941 --> 01:00:14.277
I should go.

01:00:14.277 --> 01:00:16.112
I'll drive you home.

01:00:16.112 --> 01:00:17.155
No, no. It's not a long walk.

01:00:17.155 --> 01:00:18.990
No. I-I insist.

01:00:20.241 --> 01:00:22.410
Then can I take
some cheesecake with me?

01:00:22.410 --> 01:00:23.453
For homework.

01:00:23.453 --> 01:00:26.289
You know, "homework"
gives me another idea.

01:00:28.249 --> 01:00:29.876
Really?

01:00:29.876 --> 01:00:31.336
[door thumps open]

01:00:31.336 --> 01:00:33.296
[Brad and Holly chuckling]

01:00:34.589 --> 01:00:36.466
Are you sure the owners
won't mind?

01:00:36.466 --> 01:00:37.884
Yeah, no,
they'll be fast asleep,

01:00:37.884 --> 01:00:39.093
and that part of the inn's

01:00:39.093 --> 01:00:40.219
far enough away
that no one can hear us.

01:00:40.219 --> 01:00:41.429
I feel like a spy.

01:00:41.429 --> 01:00:43.264
You are.
A baking spy.

01:00:43.264 --> 01:00:45.016
[chuckles]

01:00:46.559 --> 01:00:49.020
All right.

01:00:50.646 --> 01:00:54.108
Okay, now, the flour and sugar
are under the island there.

01:00:54.108 --> 01:00:55.651
Wait, I thought you were
showing me the kitchen,

01:00:55.651 --> 01:00:56.861
not putting me to work.

01:00:56.861 --> 01:00:58.446
Well, you said
you wanted homework, right?

01:00:58.446 --> 01:01:00.823
This is sort of like homework.

01:01:00.823 --> 01:01:02.325
I hated homework
in high school.

01:01:02.325 --> 01:01:04.869
[chuckles]

01:01:04.869 --> 01:01:05.995
Okay.

01:01:05.995 --> 01:01:08.122
Here we go.

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:10.166
Oh, and also,
grab those two bowls, please?

01:01:10.166 --> 01:01:12.335
Thank you.

01:01:19.717 --> 01:01:21.552
You're right, by the way.

01:01:21.552 --> 01:01:24.972
I didn't bring you here
just to show you the kitchen.

01:01:24.972 --> 01:01:26.391
Then... why?

01:01:26.391 --> 01:01:28.393
I have a confession to make.

01:01:29.727 --> 01:01:31.979
What confession?

01:01:31.979 --> 01:01:34.273
I kinda forgot
to make the croissants

01:01:34.273 --> 01:01:35.900
for the breakfast menu tomorrow.

01:01:35.900 --> 01:01:38.403
Oh! Oh, that's a problem.

01:01:38.403 --> 01:01:39.529
Yeah.

01:01:39.529 --> 01:01:42.115
Yeah, I-I-I've just been
so busy with the contest,

01:01:42.115 --> 01:01:43.741
and it just kind of
slipped my mind.

01:01:43.741 --> 01:01:45.076
So do you want
to make them now?

01:01:45.076 --> 01:01:46.202
Will you help?

01:01:46.202 --> 01:01:47.453
Confession.

01:01:47.453 --> 01:01:48.496
You hate croissants?

01:01:48.496 --> 01:01:49.622
Oh, I love them,

01:01:49.622 --> 01:01:51.874
and I've always wanted
to know how to make them.

01:01:51.874 --> 01:01:53.292
Excellent.

01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.882
It's a lovely room.

01:01:59.882 --> 01:02:02.093
It's more lovely
with you in it.

01:02:03.344 --> 01:02:05.054
Here, come on,
let's, uh,

01:02:05.054 --> 01:02:06.389
test out our homework.

01:02:06.389 --> 01:02:09.600
I can't believe I made these.

01:02:09.600 --> 01:02:11.853
Well... helped.

01:02:11.853 --> 01:02:13.396
We make a good team.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:16.691
Cheesecake, croissants...

01:02:16.691 --> 01:02:18.401
You're a great teacher.

01:02:18.401 --> 01:02:21.404
Oh, no. You just needed
a little encouragement.

01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:26.409
I have another confession.

01:02:26.409 --> 01:02:29.454
Why am I not surprised?

01:02:30.538 --> 01:02:33.458
There are no croissants
on the menu tomorrow.

01:02:34.625 --> 01:02:37.253
[♪♪♪]

01:02:46.929 --> 01:02:48.764
Doesn't make sense.

01:02:48.764 --> 01:02:50.224
How is it possible?

01:02:50.224 --> 01:02:52.018
Maybe it's a conspiracy.

01:02:52.018 --> 01:02:54.145
Uh, trouble, ladies?

01:02:54.145 --> 01:02:55.354
There's no nutmeg.

01:02:55.354 --> 01:02:56.397
None.

01:02:56.397 --> 01:02:58.191
It's completely gone.

01:02:58.191 --> 01:03:00.026
What, at Christmas?

01:03:00.026 --> 01:03:01.819
The shipment got stuck
in "Winter Storm Megan"

01:03:01.819 --> 01:03:03.070
that's coming this way.

01:03:03.070 --> 01:03:04.780
Not much we can do.

01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:06.991
But nutmeg
is a key ingredient.

01:03:06.991 --> 01:03:09.994
None of us will win
if there's no nutmeg.

01:03:10.995 --> 01:03:14.332
[♪♪♪]

01:03:21.631 --> 01:03:22.798
Where did you go?

01:03:22.798 --> 01:03:23.841
Home.

01:03:23.841 --> 01:03:25.801
I have a stash of nutmeg.

01:03:25.801 --> 01:03:27.929
Remember,
we used some last night?

01:03:27.929 --> 01:03:29.889
Thank you!

01:03:32.808 --> 01:03:35.311
Nathalie... Wilma...

01:03:35.311 --> 01:03:36.771
nutmeg's on me.

01:03:36.771 --> 01:03:38.898
[♪♪♪]

01:03:39.982 --> 01:03:42.193
Let's do this.

01:03:45.696 --> 01:03:47.865
Good try, Wilma.

01:03:47.865 --> 01:03:49.909
[all applauding]

01:03:52.203 --> 01:03:54.413
Good job.

01:03:57.208 --> 01:03:58.751
[♪♪♪]

01:03:58.751 --> 01:04:00.336
Wow, I'm really impressed.

01:04:03.130 --> 01:04:05.174
The contest is almost over.

01:04:05.174 --> 01:04:06.342
Yeah, can't wait.

01:04:06.342 --> 01:04:07.843
Worried about
the blind tasting?

01:04:07.843 --> 01:04:09.345
Not at all.

01:04:09.345 --> 01:04:11.889
I know my mom's baking
better than anyone.

01:04:11.889 --> 01:04:12.974
I know how important it is

01:04:12.974 --> 01:04:14.892
to be with family
during the holidays.

01:04:14.892 --> 01:04:17.144
I, um...

01:04:17.144 --> 01:04:19.689
I really miss my father.

01:04:19.689 --> 01:04:21.816
It's been five years,

01:04:21.816 --> 01:04:23.568
but it feels like
just yesterday

01:04:23.568 --> 01:04:26.654
we were spending long hours
in the bakeshop,

01:04:26.654 --> 01:04:28.406
filling out orders.

01:04:28.406 --> 01:04:29.865
Well...

01:04:29.865 --> 01:04:33.995
you could always spend Christmas
with me next year.

01:04:33.995 --> 01:04:36.372
If, you know,
you're not in Alaska.

01:04:36.372 --> 01:04:39.208
Yeah, Alaska's too far anyways.

01:04:42.753 --> 01:04:45.089
[♪♪♪]

01:04:51.929 --> 01:04:54.056
Hey, do you want to come over
for dinner tonight?

01:04:54.056 --> 01:04:55.516
For another baking lesson?

01:04:55.516 --> 01:04:58.394
No. That meal that people have
in the evening.

01:04:58.394 --> 01:05:00.605
Sometimes with wine.

01:05:02.315 --> 01:05:04.317
How's 8:00?

01:05:04.317 --> 01:05:06.110
Sounds good.

01:05:06.110 --> 01:05:08.070
Great.

01:05:20.958 --> 01:05:22.752
[Caroline] Was that Nana's?

01:05:22.752 --> 01:05:24.086
It's mine.

01:05:24.086 --> 01:05:25.087
Really?

01:05:26.130 --> 01:05:27.131
Explain again

01:05:27.131 --> 01:05:28.799
why, if this isn't a date,

01:05:28.799 --> 01:05:32.094
why are you trying on
multiple outfits?

01:05:33.137 --> 01:05:34.305
Oh, definitely not.

01:05:34.305 --> 01:05:35.473
What's wrong with it?

01:05:35.473 --> 01:05:37.516
It's too "New Year's Eve Bash"

01:05:37.516 --> 01:05:40.186
not enough
"first date romance."

01:05:40.186 --> 01:05:41.312
You're right.

01:05:41.312 --> 01:05:42.938
And it's not a date.

01:05:44.940 --> 01:05:46.108
Mm-hmm.

01:05:48.778 --> 01:05:50.154
What do you think?

01:05:50.154 --> 01:05:51.656
[Caroline] It's perfect.

01:05:51.656 --> 01:05:52.990
For a date!

01:05:52.990 --> 01:05:53.991
[Holly] That's not how it is.

01:05:53.991 --> 01:05:55.660
We're just friends.

01:05:55.660 --> 01:05:59.246
Oh! Who are you kidding,
kid sister?

01:05:59.246 --> 01:06:01.624
It's the holidays
and he's alone.

01:06:01.624 --> 01:06:04.669
So have you invited him
home for Christmas?

01:06:04.669 --> 01:06:06.170
Does Mom know?

01:06:06.170 --> 01:06:07.630
I haven't,

01:06:07.630 --> 01:06:09.298
but it's not like she'd mind.

01:06:09.298 --> 01:06:10.758
Uh, of course not!

01:06:10.758 --> 01:06:12.009
She would totally love it,

01:06:12.009 --> 01:06:13.719
especially
if he brought dessert.

01:06:13.719 --> 01:06:15.179
You're getting ahead
of yourself.

01:06:15.179 --> 01:06:16.681
Brad is just being friendly

01:06:16.681 --> 01:06:19.183
because he doesn't know
that many people here.

01:06:19.183 --> 01:06:20.476
So that's it?

01:06:20.476 --> 01:06:23.145
You just want to be friends?

01:06:24.563 --> 01:06:25.940
I'm not sure.
He's...

01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.692
...Very handsome.

01:06:27.692 --> 01:06:30.528
I was going to say
"complex."

01:06:30.528 --> 01:06:33.114
Okay. Is he a workaholic
like Jasper?

01:06:33.114 --> 01:06:34.532
Jacob.

01:06:34.532 --> 01:06:37.535
And I think Brad's different.

01:06:37.535 --> 01:06:40.871
He doesn't work for money
or promotion.

01:06:40.871 --> 01:06:42.206
His work is his passion.

01:06:42.206 --> 01:06:44.542
Like mine is for me.

01:06:44.542 --> 01:06:46.377
Wow.

01:06:46.377 --> 01:06:48.546
Well, for your sake,
I hope it is a date.

01:06:48.546 --> 01:06:50.589
Stop saying that!

01:06:50.589 --> 01:06:51.799
[laughs]

01:06:51.799 --> 01:06:54.218
Well, at least we know
what's for dessert.

01:06:56.470 --> 01:06:58.222
The cheesecake!

01:06:58.222 --> 01:07:00.391
I know what you meant.

01:07:00.391 --> 01:07:02.393
[snickers]

01:07:03.477 --> 01:07:05.563
[♪♪♪]

01:07:06.772 --> 01:07:09.233
Make yourself
comfortable, okay?

01:07:13.904 --> 01:07:15.990
Whatever you're making
smells amazing.

01:07:15.990 --> 01:07:17.908
What is it?
Duck confit? C <i> oq au vin</i> ?

01:07:17.908 --> 01:07:19.535
No such luck.

01:07:19.535 --> 01:07:22.079
Just roast chicken
and roasted root vegetables.

01:07:22.079 --> 01:07:23.164
Oh, and I made soup.

01:07:23.164 --> 01:07:24.623
Wanna come try?

01:07:24.623 --> 01:07:27.460
That's a very simple meal.

01:07:27.460 --> 01:07:29.211
And I mean that
as a compliment.

01:07:29.211 --> 01:07:30.546
I like simple food.

01:07:30.546 --> 01:07:32.590
It's all we could afford
growing up.

01:07:32.590 --> 01:07:35.926
You make it sound
as though you were poor.

01:07:35.926 --> 01:07:37.762
Dirt poor, actually.

01:07:37.762 --> 01:07:39.096
Yeah.

01:07:39.096 --> 01:07:41.724
But we were happy,
for the most part.

01:07:41.724 --> 01:07:43.768
Home-cooked food--

01:07:43.768 --> 01:07:45.811
healthy, made with love.

01:07:45.811 --> 01:07:47.646
Kind of like Mrs. Rose's.

01:07:47.646 --> 01:07:49.315
You want a sample?

01:07:49.315 --> 01:07:51.525
I would love to.

01:08:01.452 --> 01:08:02.453
Wow.

01:08:02.453 --> 01:08:03.954
It's amazing.

01:08:03.954 --> 01:08:07.124
It's my, uh,
it's my grandma's country veg.

01:08:07.124 --> 01:08:09.752
Now, the secret is
to sweat the vegetables out,

01:08:09.752 --> 01:08:10.711
and then you wait
until the very end

01:08:10.711 --> 01:08:11.712
to add the whipping cream,

01:08:11.712 --> 01:08:12.797
'cause you don't want it
to curdle.

01:08:13.798 --> 01:08:16.258
It's incredible.

01:08:16.258 --> 01:08:18.761
Oh, can I serve you a bowl?

01:08:19.804 --> 01:08:22.848
Yeah. Do you want me
to set the table?

01:08:24.140 --> 01:08:25.684
Yeah, sure.

01:08:25.684 --> 01:08:28.854
That would be nice. Yeah.

01:08:29.979 --> 01:08:31.106
That was delicious.

01:08:31.106 --> 01:08:34.151
I have to admit,
I expected something French.

01:08:34.151 --> 01:08:37.154
Ah, no, just a boy
from Fort Myers, Florida

01:08:37.154 --> 01:08:38.154
who likes to bake.

01:08:38.154 --> 01:08:39.657
Nothing complicated.

01:08:39.657 --> 01:08:41.367
But you are complex.

01:08:41.367 --> 01:08:43.618
You may be right.

01:08:45.662 --> 01:08:48.122
I'll just take these.

01:08:59.176 --> 01:09:00.845
[laughing] Oh, ho, ho!

01:09:00.845 --> 01:09:03.096
That's my grandmother.

01:09:03.096 --> 01:09:04.849
She raised me on her own.

01:09:04.849 --> 01:09:07.143
She's the one who passed down

01:09:07.143 --> 01:09:09.019
her baking passion
and skills to me.

01:09:09.019 --> 01:09:12.022
Like I said, we didn't have
a lot of money, growing up,

01:09:12.022 --> 01:09:14.024
so we made everything ourselves.

01:09:14.024 --> 01:09:16.652
Preserves, stock, bread.

01:09:16.652 --> 01:09:18.237
But...

01:09:18.237 --> 01:09:20.029
that's what made it special.

01:09:20.029 --> 01:09:21.657
Especially during the holidays,

01:09:21.657 --> 01:09:25.035
you know, when we'd bake gifts
for friends and family

01:09:25.035 --> 01:09:27.496
and the--
and the church sale.

01:09:29.372 --> 01:09:31.667
So this is how you became
a pastry chef?

01:09:31.667 --> 01:09:32.877
Yeah, it is.

01:09:32.877 --> 01:09:35.045
No fancy French school for you?

01:09:35.045 --> 01:09:36.755
No! No, no, no, no.

01:09:36.755 --> 01:09:39.758
[laughs]
I could not afford college,

01:09:39.758 --> 01:09:41.719
let alone a ticket to Paris.

01:09:41.719 --> 01:09:44.388
No, and to be honest,
I'm just a baker.

01:09:44.388 --> 01:09:45.514
You know?

01:09:45.514 --> 01:09:47.349
The inn owners
like to say pastry chef

01:09:47.349 --> 01:09:48.850
because it's more in keeping
with their brand.

01:09:50.185 --> 01:09:51.770
I'm happiest in the kitchen.

01:09:51.770 --> 01:09:54.607
It reminds me of family
and home.

01:09:54.607 --> 01:09:57.568
Yeah.

01:09:57.568 --> 01:10:00.237
That's why I want the bakery,

01:10:00.237 --> 01:10:03.073
so I can bring the gift
my grandmother gave to me

01:10:03.073 --> 01:10:05.159
to as many people as possible.

01:10:06.744 --> 01:10:08.495
Well, she taught you well.

01:10:09.747 --> 01:10:12.458
That's the true me.

01:10:14.585 --> 01:10:17.546
I've been meaning
to thank you.

01:10:17.546 --> 01:10:18.756
For what?

01:10:18.756 --> 01:10:20.925
For the egg.

01:10:20.925 --> 01:10:23.802
The egg you slipped
into my gingerbread batter

01:10:23.802 --> 01:10:25.054
on the first day.

01:10:25.054 --> 01:10:27.431
And I thought
I was so stealthy.

01:10:27.431 --> 01:10:29.058
Mm, well, it was
an honest mistake,

01:10:29.058 --> 01:10:30.267
forgetting the eggs.

01:10:30.267 --> 01:10:33.312
And besides, I, uh,
I wanted to keep you around.

01:10:33.312 --> 01:10:36.106
Oh, really? Why?

01:10:36.106 --> 01:10:38.943
Well, I, uh,
I liked our batter banter.

01:10:38.943 --> 01:10:40.903
Hmm.

01:10:40.903 --> 01:10:43.572
So, um, what's for dessert?

01:10:43.572 --> 01:10:45.574
Leftover cheesecake?

01:10:45.574 --> 01:10:47.117
How did you guess?

01:10:52.873 --> 01:10:55.501
[♪♪♪]

01:11:02.049 --> 01:11:03.884
Okay!

01:11:03.884 --> 01:11:06.220
Everybody, time.

01:11:06.220 --> 01:11:08.430
Because tomorrow
is Christmas Eve,

01:11:08.430 --> 01:11:11.558
and we're so close
to the end of the contest,

01:11:11.558 --> 01:11:13.435
I thought it would be fun

01:11:13.435 --> 01:11:16.271
to make today
a blind-tasting day.

01:11:16.271 --> 01:11:19.149
But I thought the blind tasting
was for my final decision.

01:11:19.149 --> 01:11:22.319
Just look at it
as a practice run, Carson.

01:11:22.319 --> 01:11:23.612
It'll be fun!

01:11:23.612 --> 01:11:24.822
But I--

01:11:24.822 --> 01:11:27.866
We'll blindfold Loretta first.

01:11:27.866 --> 01:11:29.660
And we will give you
a taste of each slice,

01:11:29.660 --> 01:11:33.831
and then you will let us know
which one is your favourite--

01:11:33.831 --> 01:11:35.874
one, two, or three.

01:11:44.383 --> 01:11:46.677
[♪♪♪]

01:11:48.345 --> 01:11:50.055
And here's number three.

01:11:50.055 --> 01:11:52.057
Okay.

01:11:54.351 --> 01:11:56.395
Mm! [giggles]

01:12:00.149 --> 01:12:04.028
Well, seems like we have
a tie for second place.

01:12:04.028 --> 01:12:05.070
Nathalie, Holly,

01:12:05.070 --> 01:12:06.655
either one of you could
be eliminated next.

01:12:07.990 --> 01:12:09.158
Carson.

01:12:11.618 --> 01:12:13.037
Okay.

01:12:13.037 --> 01:12:14.079
You ready?

01:12:14.079 --> 01:12:15.414
Yes.

01:12:15.414 --> 01:12:17.499
Number three.

01:12:17.499 --> 01:12:19.960
And I have some icing, too.

01:12:21.795 --> 01:12:23.547
[♪♪♪]

01:12:27.009 --> 01:12:29.720
Okay.

01:12:29.720 --> 01:12:33.390
I'll go with two
as my first choice.

01:12:33.390 --> 01:12:34.516
That's Brad.

01:12:36.810 --> 01:12:39.938
The caramel in one
was too runny.

01:12:39.938 --> 01:12:42.441
It ruined
the texture of the cake.

01:12:42.441 --> 01:12:44.651
So I'll go with...

01:12:44.651 --> 01:12:46.195
three.

01:12:48.864 --> 01:12:50.699
Nathalie, I'm sorry.

01:12:50.699 --> 01:12:51.825
[onlookers applauding]

01:12:54.078 --> 01:12:55.079
Thanks.

01:12:55.079 --> 01:12:56.663
Thank you, guys.

01:12:58.957 --> 01:12:59.917
Thanks!

01:12:59.917 --> 01:13:01.502
[both laugh]

01:13:02.586 --> 01:13:04.713
You know, if your cake
was in the mix,

01:13:04.713 --> 01:13:06.590
I would've known instantly.

01:13:06.590 --> 01:13:10.094
We'll see how well you know me
come Christmas Eve.

01:13:10.094 --> 01:13:11.470
I'm ready.

01:13:14.264 --> 01:13:15.432
It's just the two of us now.

01:13:15.432 --> 01:13:18.018
I'm so going to kick your butt,
Brad Beauchamp.

01:13:18.018 --> 01:13:19.770
[phone rings]

01:13:19.770 --> 01:13:21.688
Excuse me.
I have to take this, it's work.

01:13:21.688 --> 01:13:23.565
Yeah, of course.

01:13:25.192 --> 01:13:26.777
Hello?

01:13:26.777 --> 01:13:29.446
Holly? You got the job.

01:13:29.446 --> 01:13:30.823
<i>What?</i>

01:13:30.823 --> 01:13:31.865
Urban Gourmet,

01:13:31.865 --> 01:13:33.117
<i>they want to hire you.</i>

01:13:33.117 --> 01:13:34.910
Oh, my God.
That's incredible.

01:13:34.910 --> 01:13:36.370
<i>Told you,
you were a shoo-in.</i>

01:13:36.370 --> 01:13:38.497
Oh, I'm so happy.

01:13:38.497 --> 01:13:39.957
Welcome to the team, Holly.

01:13:39.957 --> 01:13:41.125
I can't wait.

01:13:41.125 --> 01:13:42.334
<i>Want to know the best part?</i>

01:13:42.334 --> 01:13:43.460
What?

01:13:43.460 --> 01:13:45.462
<i>We get to work together
full-time,</i>

01:13:45.462 --> 01:13:46.922
<i>so that's lunch
and after-work drinks,</i>

01:13:46.922 --> 01:13:48.340
<i>five days a week,
if you want.</i>

01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:50.676
Lunch and cocktails,
I like the sound of that.

01:13:50.676 --> 01:13:53.011
After-work drinks, silly.

01:13:53.011 --> 01:13:54.721
<i>We're both single,
the city is ours,</i>

01:13:54.721 --> 01:13:56.140
<i>and there's plenty
of great men to choose from.</i>

01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:57.141
Are there?

01:13:57.141 --> 01:13:58.267
<i>Duh! It's New York.</i>

01:13:58.267 --> 01:13:59.935
<i>All the best men are here.
You know that.</i>

01:13:59.935 --> 01:14:01.436
<i>Oh, I forgot to tell you,</i>

01:14:01.436 --> 01:14:02.938
<i>you start
the day after Christmas.</i>

01:14:02.938 --> 01:14:05.107
<i>We've got this giant
New Year's Eve layout to shoot,</i>

01:14:05.107 --> 01:14:07.151
<i>but you're a workaholic
like me, so you won't mind.</i>

01:14:07.151 --> 01:14:08.735
<i>Bye.</i>

01:14:08.735 --> 01:14:10.362
<i>Oh, and Merry Christmas.</i>

01:14:10.362 --> 01:14:12.364
Merry Christmas.

01:14:12.364 --> 01:14:15.325
[♪♪♪]

01:14:15.325 --> 01:14:16.994
[all chuckling]

01:14:16.994 --> 01:14:19.997
I like that.

01:14:20.998 --> 01:14:24.334
I, uh, I got the job
at <i> Urban Gourmet.</i>

01:14:24.334 --> 01:14:27.504
[gasping] Oh.
Well, congratulations, darling.

01:14:27.504 --> 01:14:29.006
You worked so hard.

01:14:29.006 --> 01:14:31.842
Yeah, that's awesome.
I'm so proud of you.

01:14:31.842 --> 01:14:34.678
[unconvincingly] It's my, uh,
it's my dream job, so.

01:14:34.678 --> 01:14:37.389
Well, does this mean
you're forfeiting,

01:14:37.389 --> 01:14:39.975
so you can get back
to Manhattan?

01:14:39.975 --> 01:14:41.351
Uh, no way.

01:14:41.351 --> 01:14:44.188
I can't let Brad win without
some friendly competition.

01:14:44.188 --> 01:14:45.355
[Brad chuckles]

01:14:45.355 --> 01:14:47.983
I'm happy for you,
if it's what you really want.

01:14:49.693 --> 01:14:52.529
I've wanted to work with
this magazine my whole career,

01:14:52.529 --> 01:14:54.323
and now that
it's actually happening,

01:14:54.323 --> 01:14:56.325
it doesn't quite feel real.

01:14:56.325 --> 01:14:59.953
Well, in that case, I guess
Christmas came early for you.

01:15:05.751 --> 01:15:08.670
[winds gusting]

01:15:18.555 --> 01:15:20.724
Oh, this is a surprise.

01:15:20.724 --> 01:15:23.685
Um, Mrs. Rose, I have
to ask you a favor.

01:15:23.685 --> 01:15:25.938
Can you promise me
that Brad will win?

01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:28.774
Excuse me?

01:15:28.774 --> 01:15:31.527
Are you asking me
to fix the contest?

01:15:31.527 --> 01:15:32.694
I mean, let's be honest,

01:15:32.694 --> 01:15:34.112
I'm never going to beat him
at baking,

01:15:34.112 --> 01:15:35.530
but I've gotten
to know him better

01:15:35.530 --> 01:15:36.698
and I can honestly think

01:15:36.698 --> 01:15:39.117
that your shop couldn't be
in better hands.

01:15:39.117 --> 01:15:41.995
Well, that is high praise
from someone

01:15:41.995 --> 01:15:45.082
who practically grew up
inside these walls.

01:15:45.082 --> 01:15:46.208
I'll see what I can do,

01:15:46.208 --> 01:15:48.293
but it's gonna ultimately
come down

01:15:48.293 --> 01:15:51.171
to how well
Carson knows my cooking.

01:15:51.171 --> 01:15:54.424
Well, I've tried Brad's baking,
and, please, don't be upset,

01:15:54.424 --> 01:15:56.551
but it is kind of difficult
to tell the difference

01:15:56.551 --> 01:15:57.636
between his and yours.

01:15:57.636 --> 01:15:59.263
Oh...

01:15:59.263 --> 01:16:00.889
Well.

01:16:00.889 --> 01:16:03.767
Carson, then,
won't be a factor.

01:16:03.767 --> 01:16:05.435
[both giggling]

01:16:05.435 --> 01:16:07.312
Okay, thank you.

-Hey.

01:16:15.028 --> 01:16:17.447
Uh, what are you doing here?

01:16:17.447 --> 01:16:19.074
Just getting
my morning coffee.

01:16:19.074 --> 01:16:21.368
Yeah, same. Same.

01:16:21.368 --> 01:16:23.287
Where's your coffee?

01:16:23.287 --> 01:16:24.746
I... drank it.

01:16:24.746 --> 01:16:26.081
I'll see you later.

01:16:26.081 --> 01:16:27.082
Okay.

01:16:30.794 --> 01:16:31.837
So...

01:16:31.837 --> 01:16:35.173
you want me to fix the contest
so Holly wins,

01:16:35.173 --> 01:16:37.551
even though
you are the better baker?

01:16:37.551 --> 01:16:38.927
I just don't think
she'll be happy

01:16:38.927 --> 01:16:40.137
in New York at that job,

01:16:40.137 --> 01:16:41.763
but she needs a reason
to stay in Madison,

01:16:41.763 --> 01:16:43.890
and I know how much
she loves this place.

01:16:43.890 --> 01:16:48.562
Oh... well,
that's very noble of you, Brad.

01:16:48.562 --> 01:16:51.690
Look, I can be perfectly content
baking at the inn,

01:16:51.690 --> 01:16:53.734
but Holly needs this.

01:16:53.734 --> 01:16:57.195
Look, if her baking isn't
as good as it needs to be,

01:16:57.195 --> 01:16:59.740
you know, just switch
mine in for hers, okay?

01:16:59.740 --> 01:17:00.741
No one has to know.

01:17:00.741 --> 01:17:02.659
-Mm.
-Please?

01:17:05.787 --> 01:17:08.165
I'll see what I can do.

01:17:08.165 --> 01:17:09.416
-Okay.
-Mm.

01:17:09.416 --> 01:17:11.293
-Thank you.
-Uh-huh.

01:17:11.293 --> 01:17:13.295
Did you get that?

01:17:13.295 --> 01:17:15.172
That is so romantic.

Christmas is the most romantic
time of the year.

Speaking of that...

01:17:23.764 --> 01:17:26.475
I've been practicing
the recipe you gave me.

01:17:26.475 --> 01:17:27.726
And?

01:17:27.726 --> 01:17:28.852

01:18:09.935 --> 01:18:12.062
Did my mom give this to you?

01:18:12.062 --> 01:18:13.563
She gave me the recipe.

01:18:13.563 --> 01:18:16.191
I knew it was your favorite,
so I wanted to learn.

01:18:16.191 --> 01:18:18.193
Baked it myself.
Try it.

01:18:25.784 --> 01:18:27.369
It's just like my mom makes.

01:18:27.369 --> 01:18:29.746
-Really?
-Really. [laughs]

01:18:29.746 --> 01:18:31.623
I don't know what to say.

01:18:31.623 --> 01:18:34.042
No one other than my mom
has ever made me anything.

01:18:37.712 --> 01:18:39.297
Your mom seems happy.

01:18:39.297 --> 01:18:40.841
About the contest,
I mean.

01:18:40.841 --> 01:18:43.802
Yeah, I have to admit,
it's been fun to watch.

01:18:43.802 --> 01:18:44.970
Especially seeing

01:18:44.970 --> 01:18:46.263
what's been developing
between Holly and Brad.

01:18:47.431 --> 01:18:49.224
I think
they're falling in love.

01:18:49.224 --> 01:18:50.976
You know,
now that you mention it,

01:18:50.976 --> 01:18:53.728
they do laugh and talk
a lot more than they did.

01:18:53.728 --> 01:18:56.231
If it's meant to be,
they'll definitely fall in love.

01:18:56.231 --> 01:18:58.191
Ah, I should get going.

01:18:58.191 --> 01:19:00.444
I gotta get things ready
for the final bake-off tonight,

01:19:00.444 --> 01:19:02.904
and that storm is brutal.

01:19:02.904 --> 01:19:04.614
Yeah, Mom's boyfriend
is supposed to come tonight.

01:19:04.614 --> 01:19:06.324
I hope he makes it
through the storm okay.

01:19:06.324 --> 01:19:07.451
Me too.

01:19:07.451 --> 01:19:09.953
I'll, uh, see you
at the judging table later.

01:19:09.953 --> 01:19:11.955
Yeah.

01:19:27.387 --> 01:19:28.638
I'm so worried

01:19:28.638 --> 01:19:31.266
that Christian isn't gonna
make it through this storm.

01:19:31.266 --> 01:19:32.142
He'll be here.

01:19:32.142 --> 01:19:34.144
[sighs anxiously] Okay.

01:19:37.856 --> 01:19:39.774
Ladies and gentlemen,

01:19:39.774 --> 01:19:41.985
Holly and Brad,

01:19:41.985 --> 01:19:44.321
welcome
to the final bake-off.

01:19:44.321 --> 01:19:45.655
So...

01:19:45.655 --> 01:19:47.115
it's Christmas Eve

01:19:47.115 --> 01:19:49.618
and it is only fitting

01:19:49.618 --> 01:19:51.203
that the final recipe

01:19:51.203 --> 01:19:53.455
be one of tradition,

01:19:53.455 --> 01:19:54.498
a classic--

01:19:54.498 --> 01:19:58.001
my First Day of Christmas
iced sugar cookie.

01:19:58.001 --> 01:19:59.294
[all gasping]

01:19:59.294 --> 01:20:02.964
Oh! Often,
the simplest things in life

01:20:02.964 --> 01:20:05.967
are the things
that make you the happiest,

01:20:05.967 --> 01:20:07.761
but simple isn't easy,

01:20:07.761 --> 01:20:11.640
which is what makes life
even sweeter.

01:20:11.640 --> 01:20:13.808
Let the bake-off begin!

01:20:13.808 --> 01:20:14.851
[Brad] You got this.

01:20:14.851 --> 01:20:17.521
[♪♪♪]

01:20:31.868 --> 01:20:34.496
Looking good.

01:20:48.093 --> 01:20:49.636
[smack]

01:20:49.636 --> 01:20:51.846
Let's get those cookies
in the oven!

01:20:57.143 --> 01:20:58.937
-Good luck!
-Good luck!

01:20:58.937 --> 01:21:00.522
Oh! What happened?

01:21:00.522 --> 01:21:02.190
I think the power's out.

01:21:02.190 --> 01:21:03.233
Yeah, it must be the snowstorm.

01:21:03.233 --> 01:21:04.276
It probably knocked out

01:21:04.276 --> 01:21:05.777
the electricity
on the whole block.

01:21:05.777 --> 01:21:08.780
I don't think we can finish
as we planned.

01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:10.115
Well, can we freeze the dough?

01:21:10.115 --> 01:21:12.117
Well, don't you have to be
in New York day after tomorrow?

01:21:12.117 --> 01:21:13.326
No. We should finish tonight.

01:21:13.326 --> 01:21:14.494
[Holly] How?

01:21:14.494 --> 01:21:17.330
We could go to the bakery.
They have a generator.

01:21:17.330 --> 01:21:18.456
That's a great idea.

01:21:18.456 --> 01:21:20.500
Let's go!

01:21:20.500 --> 01:21:22.419
-Let's do it.
-Okay.

01:21:28.758 --> 01:21:31.511
[♪♪♪]

01:21:43.064 --> 01:21:44.608
That's enough!

01:21:44.608 --> 01:21:47.110
Holly, Brad, time is up.

01:21:51.156 --> 01:21:52.574
May the best baker win.

01:21:52.574 --> 01:21:54.117
I think she will.

01:21:54.117 --> 01:21:55.577
[♪♪♪]

01:21:55.577 --> 01:21:57.287
[gasping] Oh!

01:21:57.287 --> 01:21:59.414
Christian!

01:22:00.498 --> 01:22:04.586
Everybody, this is Christian,
my beau from the far north.

01:22:05.795 --> 01:22:07.005
Hello, everyone.

01:22:07.005 --> 01:22:08.840
You know, it's quite a storm
out there,

01:22:08.840 --> 01:22:10.800
but I wasn't gonna let any snow

01:22:10.800 --> 01:22:12.802
stop me from seeing my love
on Christmas.

01:22:12.802 --> 01:22:14.471
Oh, baby!

01:22:14.471 --> 01:22:15.722
[crowd chuckling]

01:22:15.722 --> 01:22:18.224
Well, now
that we're all here...

01:22:18.224 --> 01:22:20.060
As you all know,

01:22:20.060 --> 01:22:22.312
my mom and Christian
devised this contest

01:22:22.312 --> 01:22:24.147
as a way to find someone

01:22:24.147 --> 01:22:27.025
who loved Christmas baking
as much as she did.

01:22:27.025 --> 01:22:29.361
Now, I was skeptical,

01:22:29.361 --> 01:22:30.862
and gave myself final veto

01:22:30.862 --> 01:22:34.491
to ensure that only someone
who baked exactly like my mom

01:22:34.491 --> 01:22:36.493
would own the bakeshop...

01:22:36.493 --> 01:22:39.663
Over the past several days,

01:22:39.663 --> 01:22:42.749
I realized that...

01:22:42.749 --> 01:22:46.336
the bakery isn't just mine
or my mother's.

01:22:46.336 --> 01:22:48.713
It belongs to everyone
in Madison.

01:22:52.175 --> 01:22:53.843
This is the lease,

01:22:53.843 --> 01:22:55.679
and I'm prepared
to sign it over tonight,

01:22:55.679 --> 01:22:58.848
even if the final winner
can't match my mom,

01:22:58.848 --> 01:23:02.727
because what
I've come to understand is...

01:23:04.062 --> 01:23:06.147
No one can replace her.

01:23:06.147 --> 01:23:08.191
[gasps] Oh...

01:23:08.191 --> 01:23:10.193
[crowd applauding]

01:23:14.698 --> 01:23:15.865
Well...

01:23:15.865 --> 01:23:18.618
it's time
for the final tasting.

01:23:21.663 --> 01:23:23.957
[♪♪♪]

01:23:37.887 --> 01:23:39.222
Mm...

01:23:39.222 --> 01:23:41.808
That would make
Santa linger all night.

01:23:41.808 --> 01:23:43.435
[laughter and applause]

01:23:46.354 --> 01:23:49.190
[♪♪♪]

01:24:02.912 --> 01:24:04.748
Equally delicious.

01:24:04.748 --> 01:24:06.833
[crowd chuckles and applauds]

01:24:09.043 --> 01:24:10.670
Wow.

01:24:10.670 --> 01:24:12.714
Okay, Carson, let's discuss.

01:24:12.714 --> 01:24:15.008
Ahem.

01:24:15.008 --> 01:24:17.427
[♪♪♪]

01:24:23.975 --> 01:24:25.268
[chuckles]

01:24:25.268 --> 01:24:26.853
Well...

01:24:26.853 --> 01:24:31.524
we've decided
that the only fair thing to do

01:24:31.524 --> 01:24:33.151
is to declare...

01:24:33.151 --> 01:24:35.945
a tie!

01:24:35.945 --> 01:24:38.031
[gasping and applauding]

01:24:38.031 --> 01:24:39.449
Holly, Brad...

01:24:39.449 --> 01:24:41.493
you both win the bakery,

01:24:41.493 --> 01:24:44.996
but there is
one stipulation...

01:24:44.996 --> 01:24:48.041
and that is
to run it together.

01:24:48.041 --> 01:24:50.001
I'm willing to try,
if you are.

01:24:50.001 --> 01:24:51.419
Definitely.

01:24:51.419 --> 01:24:53.505
Well, Carson, let's get

01:24:53.505 --> 01:24:57.509
these two newly-minted
bakeshop owners

01:24:57.509 --> 01:25:00.637
to sign those papers,
make it official.

01:25:00.637 --> 01:25:02.305
Does this mean
I get to keep my job?

01:25:02.305 --> 01:25:04.641
Of course! You're as much
a part of the team as we are.

01:25:04.641 --> 01:25:05.767
And you too, Carson.

01:25:05.767 --> 01:25:06.810
Me?

01:25:06.810 --> 01:25:07.811
[Brad] Yeah, we'll need
a financial planner

01:25:07.811 --> 01:25:08.686
to help us with the books.

01:25:08.686 --> 01:25:11.856
We're just bakers, after all.

01:25:11.856 --> 01:25:13.858
[laughter and applause]

01:25:15.819 --> 01:25:17.153
One sec, one sec.

01:25:17.153 --> 01:25:18.905
I'll be right back.

01:25:22.033 --> 01:25:23.201
[Holly laughs]

01:25:23.201 --> 01:25:25.829
Are you ready to do
this crazy adventure?

01:25:25.829 --> 01:25:27.664
Absolutely.

01:25:27.664 --> 01:25:29.666
After all, it is Christmas.

01:25:29.666 --> 01:25:31.626
A sweet Christmas,
at that.

01:25:31.626 --> 01:25:34.128
[♪♪♪]

01:25:41.845 --> 01:25:43.346
You know, we make a good team.

01:25:43.346 --> 01:25:44.722
You bake, I decorate.

01:25:44.722 --> 01:25:45.932
Together, we are...

01:25:45.932 --> 01:25:47.725
Magic.

01:25:47.725 --> 01:25:50.687
But we do have
a big decision to make.

01:25:50.687 --> 01:25:51.896
What's that?

01:25:51.896 --> 01:25:54.357
Well, I know Mrs. Rose's
is a local legend,

01:25:54.357 --> 01:25:55.650
but, you know,

01:25:55.650 --> 01:25:57.819
we should probably come up
with a name of our own.

01:25:57.819 --> 01:25:59.863
What did you have in mind?

01:25:59.863 --> 01:26:03.449
I was thinking, uh...
Brad Beauchamp's Bakery.

01:26:03.449 --> 01:26:06.536
What about
Holly's Home Bakery?

01:26:06.536 --> 01:26:08.663
[grumbles]
I don't know.

01:26:08.663 --> 01:26:09.873
[both laughing]

01:26:09.873 --> 01:26:11.040
Who are we kidding?

01:26:11.040 --> 01:26:12.876
It will always be
Mrs. Rose's Bakery.

01:26:12.876 --> 01:26:13.877
Mm-hmm.

01:26:13.877 --> 01:26:15.128
Something else we agree on.

01:26:23.553 --> 01:26:25.096
Our first customer.

01:26:25.096 --> 01:26:27.390
She looks like
a tough one to please.

01:26:27.390 --> 01:26:29.183
[door bells jingle]

01:26:30.226 --> 01:26:31.227
Hi there.

01:26:31.227 --> 01:26:32.604
Hi...

01:26:32.604 --> 01:26:35.064
Hi.

01:26:35.064 --> 01:26:36.399
Hi there.

01:26:36.399 --> 01:26:37.775
You're not Santa.

01:26:37.775 --> 01:26:38.860
Are you sure?

01:26:38.860 --> 01:26:40.737
Which one would you like?

01:26:40.737 --> 01:26:42.780
How much for that one?

01:26:45.408 --> 01:26:48.244
It's on us.
Good choice.

01:26:48.244 --> 01:26:50.121
Santa's favorite.

01:26:53.625 --> 01:26:54.918
Merry Christmas.

01:26:54.918 --> 01:26:56.961
Merry
Christmas.
