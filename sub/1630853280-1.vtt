02:34.956 --> 02:35.890
Now,

02:36.691 --> 02:39.192
looks like
a little cocksucker, all right.

02:48.836 --> 02:50.505
Always a pleasure, Vin.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.272
Worth every fuckin' penny, pal.

02:54.842 --> 02:56.476
Shut the fuck up!

02:59.514 --> 03:00.848
You want in on any of this?

03:01.616 --> 03:02.583
I'll pass.

03:02.617 --> 03:03.618
Oh, yeah.

03:03.651 --> 03:06.219
Retrieval only. I forgot.

03:09.757 --> 03:10.925
Your next gig?

05:54.021 --> 05:56.057
Hey. Gotta dance.

05:56.090 --> 05:57.558
Get somebody else.

05:57.592 --> 05:58.726
He asked for you.

05:58.759 --> 05:59.961
I don't want to leave.

05:59.994 --> 06:01.494
You're not going anywhere.

06:02.129 --> 06:03.698
Listen to me.

06:03.731 --> 06:04.932
Your numbers are low.
You owe the house.

06:04.966 --> 06:06.701
You need to get out there.

06:16.711 --> 06:17.912
I always pay.

06:20.181 --> 06:21.549
All right.

06:22.650 --> 06:24.118
Coming up next to the stage,

06:24.819 --> 06:26.053
Waterfall!

06:35.897 --> 06:37.765
You are a hard girl to find.

06:42.937 --> 06:43.871
M-mm.

06:48.109 --> 06:49.677
That was the idea.

06:50.544 --> 06:51.812
What are you doing here?

06:51.846 --> 06:52.914
Just business.

06:54.481 --> 06:56.918
Thought I'd see my favorite
dancing girl on there.

06:59.654 --> 07:00.688
You miss me?

07:11.132 --> 07:12.499
No.

07:12.533 --> 07:13.466
I don't miss you.

07:15.970 --> 07:18.005
You know,
the boss wants to see you.

07:20.574 --> 07:21.474
Which one?

07:25.212 --> 07:27.480
I only work for Jefe,
you know that.

07:30.851 --> 07:32.053
Yes.

07:32.086 --> 07:33.220
Whatever you say.

07:38.793 --> 07:40.928
Somebody's
been talkin' about me.

07:42.596 --> 07:43.597
They around?

07:51.939 --> 07:54.508
Someone's been sayin'
I'm workin' for myself.

07:55.843 --> 07:58.012
It ain't true,
and it's got to stop.

08:01.916 --> 08:03.651
I heard it was you.

08:08.656 --> 08:10.490
Rumors about me all the time.

08:11.058 --> 08:12.526
But I'll make sure

08:13.694 --> 08:14.895
to put out the word.

08:15.830 --> 08:18.165
Angel is an honest man,

08:18.199 --> 08:19.133
untouchable,

08:20.234 --> 08:21.635
no more name calling.

08:28.943 --> 08:31.178
Always good to see you again.

08:32.813 --> 08:33.948
Me, too, but,

08:34.315 --> 08:35.683
I don't do that anymore.

08:36.116 --> 08:37.183
Only dancing.

08:37.684 --> 08:39.720
Oh, just one more time,

08:39.754 --> 08:42.056
like we used to.

08:42.089 --> 08:43.090
No! I can't!

08:44.058 --> 08:45.226
No!

08:46.060 --> 08:46.994
You get off...

08:47.428 --> 08:49.296
Fuck off!

08:49.997 --> 08:52.066
Come here, you little...

09:00.307 --> 09:01.675
Hey!

09:17.825 --> 09:18.793
Hi, handsome!

09:18.826 --> 09:19.760
Can give me a ride?

09:19.794 --> 09:20.728
- Uh...
- Please?

09:20.761 --> 09:22.263
Sure. Where we going?

09:22.296 --> 09:23.664
Wherever you are.

09:24.165 --> 09:25.332
- Please?
- Oh-okay.

09:26.000 --> 09:27.835
Let's go.

09:27.868 --> 09:29.837
- Let's go! Go! Go!
- Okay, okay! I'm drivin'!

09:55.029 --> 09:57.131
<i>Please leave
a message for, Cully.</i>

09:58.766 --> 10:00.801
<i>Cully.
Where the fuck are you?</i>

10:00.835 --> 10:03.804
<i>You missed the drop.
Check in. Now.</i>

10:05.106 --> 10:06.006
<i>Message deleted.</i>

10:07.875 --> 10:10.044
<i>His patience
is wearing thin, my friend.</i>

10:10.077 --> 10:11.779
<i>You know how this goes.</i>

10:11.812 --> 10:14.815
<i>Either you come to us,
or we come to you.</i>

10:14.849 --> 10:17.118
<i>Don't make us
come find you, Cully.</i>

10:18.752 --> 10:19.653
<i>Message deleted.</i>

10:21.222 --> 10:22.323
<i>Daddy,
pick up your phone.</i>

10:22.356 --> 10:24.125
<i>I need to talk to you.</i>

10:24.158 --> 10:25.392
<i>I really want you
to share in this with us,</i>

10:25.426 --> 10:27.094
<i>so don't be mad, okay?</i>

10:27.128 --> 10:29.730
<i>Love you, Daddy. Call me.</i>

10:29.763 --> 10:31.298
<i>Message saved.</i>

12:45.132 --> 12:47.134
Yo, Cully. Come out.

12:48.969 --> 12:49.970
Okay. Okay.

14:44.552 --> 14:45.486
Get out of the car.

14:51.425 --> 14:52.594
I can get you money.

14:55.295 --> 14:56.230
No.

14:57.097 --> 14:57.998
Put these on.

15:01.335 --> 15:03.170
Oh, come on.

15:03.203 --> 15:05.105
Let me take the car south
and I can get you real money.

15:06.173 --> 15:07.609
How am I supposed to
get my next job

15:07.642 --> 15:09.209
if I sell out on this one?

15:09.243 --> 15:10.678
Come on, man,
you don't have to do this.

15:11.546 --> 15:12.647
I know.

15:12.680 --> 15:14.415
I just love it so much.

15:15.249 --> 15:16.183
Damn.

15:17.552 --> 15:18.553
Really?

15:42.209 --> 15:43.210
Yeah.

15:43.243 --> 15:44.178
What?

15:45.780 --> 15:47.347
I've been trippin'
over bounty hunters

15:47.381 --> 15:48.683
all the way down the coast.

15:50.518 --> 15:51.719
Well...

15:51.753 --> 15:53.220
somebody sent them.

15:57.224 --> 15:58.158
The car.

16:00.595 --> 16:01.596
Yeah, it's here.

16:03.130 --> 16:04.498
The deal was for the driver.

16:06.534 --> 16:07.702
Fine.

16:08.536 --> 16:09.970
The car'll cost him extra.

16:11.706 --> 16:13.140
Change of plans.

16:25.486 --> 16:26.453
Where we goin'?

16:26.955 --> 16:29.022
Disneyland?

16:29.056 --> 16:30.224
Get in.

16:32.760 --> 16:34.094
Hey, look,
I like your car better.

16:34.127 --> 16:35.195
Yeah. Well, come on.

16:46.473 --> 16:47.742
This car is empty, dog.

16:48.108 --> 16:49.544
You got a gas card?

16:54.616 --> 16:55.517
I said no.

16:57.117 --> 16:58.753
Lot of trouble
for a piece of shit car.

16:58.786 --> 17:00.320
Oh, man, that's not heavy.

17:00.354 --> 17:01.556
I'm gonna have to
pay that shit back.

17:09.531 --> 17:12.232
Hey, baby.
I wanna listen to music.

17:12.266 --> 17:14.502
Can you leave
the keys in the car, please?

17:14.536 --> 17:16.069
You're so cute.

17:16.103 --> 17:17.337
Hey, okay. But after this,

17:17.371 --> 17:18.806
can we go to
the hotel up the street.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.406
I know a good one,
it's a hourly rate.

17:20.440 --> 17:22.209
We can save money...

17:22.242 --> 17:24.478
I know exactly what you want,
looking forward to it.

17:24.512 --> 17:26.580
- Go, go!
- Okay.

17:26.614 --> 17:28.816
Okay, okay, okay.

17:28.850 --> 17:31.418
Hey! Come back soon!

17:39.126 --> 17:41.094
Hey, baby. Get me a lemonade!

17:41.128 --> 17:42.429
A lemonade? Okay!

17:53.407 --> 17:55.610
Oh! What the fuck?
Get out my way!

17:57.177 --> 17:57.879
Shit!

17:57.912 --> 17:59.581
Fuck. Fuck.

18:09.591 --> 18:10.625
Asshole!

18:14.461 --> 18:15.663
Where you goin'?

18:19.534 --> 18:20.635
Wait!

18:30.310 --> 18:31.713
Hey, what are you
gonna do with me?

18:32.847 --> 18:33.815
Take you back.

18:34.816 --> 18:35.717
Today?

18:36.283 --> 18:37.184
Right now.

18:39.453 --> 18:42.222
They're gonna kill me
once they get their hands on me!

18:42.255 --> 18:43.725
Jefe's a powerful man.

18:43.758 --> 18:45.192
You should have
thought about that

18:45.225 --> 18:47.327
before you stole his car.

18:47.361 --> 18:48.428
Oh, really?

18:48.462 --> 18:49.731
Thanks a lot, jackass.

18:50.263 --> 18:52.232
Hindsight's twenty-twenty,
all right?

18:54.869 --> 18:56.169
Motherfucker.

18:56.938 --> 18:58.573
You know, I gotta make a stop.

18:59.874 --> 19:00.775
Hey!

19:04.646 --> 19:05.546
You hear me?

19:06.714 --> 19:08.348
I gotta make one stop.

19:09.483 --> 19:10.417
Yeah.

19:10.885 --> 19:12.152
Said I gotta make a...

19:14.287 --> 19:15.322
One stop.

19:17.525 --> 19:19.359
- This ain't a taxi, man.
- I got a kid.

19:20.662 --> 19:22.329
- You got a kid?
- Yeah.

19:22.362 --> 19:23.330
Good for you.

19:23.363 --> 19:24.799
Hey, look. Come on.

19:24.832 --> 19:26.634
She's young,
I haven't seen her in years.

19:26.668 --> 19:28.936
Please.
She's gettin' married tomorrow.

19:28.970 --> 19:30.404
That ain't my problem.

19:31.039 --> 19:32.740
Oh, come on, man!
I'm beggin' you, man!

19:32.774 --> 19:34.274
Please.

19:34.307 --> 19:35.810
- Come on, man!
- Do you ever shut up?

19:36.511 --> 19:39.246
One more word out of you
and you're goin' in the trunk.

19:39.279 --> 19:40.347
Please?

19:40.948 --> 19:41.849
Is that a word?

19:43.383 --> 19:44.418
Yeah.

19:44.886 --> 19:46.521
Come on. Please!

20:18.452 --> 20:19.654
Where is he?

20:19.687 --> 20:20.755
I don't know.

20:22.456 --> 20:24.726
Please don't kill me.
I won't say anything.

20:28.529 --> 20:29.597
I know.

21:32.059 --> 21:34.529
Oi, Turk. Fancy seeing you here.

21:34.562 --> 21:35.930
Five million ride, man.

21:35.963 --> 21:37.031
Go! Go! Go!

21:37.064 --> 21:38.599
I'm goin'! Jesus!

21:38.633 --> 21:40.500
Maybe we find some place
to ditch the car.

21:40.535 --> 21:42.103
Can't ditch the car.
We can't ditch the car.

21:42.136 --> 21:44.906
We're standin' out, Cully!
We've been made.

21:44.939 --> 21:47.374
No! We can't lose the car!
All right?

22:51.471 --> 22:52.573
Oh, man, there's nothing
wrong with this car.

22:52.607 --> 22:53.741
This car is fine, dude.

22:55.042 --> 22:55.977
Bro.

23:00.081 --> 23:01.515
Oh, you can trust me, you know?

23:01.549 --> 23:02.482
Yeah.

23:32.914 --> 23:33.781
Oh, shit.

23:53.901 --> 23:55.503
It's a money car.

23:55.536 --> 23:56.504
Oh. Yeah.

23:57.004 --> 23:58.139
From over the border.

23:59.040 --> 24:00.141
Oh.

24:00.174 --> 24:01.609
- Originally, yeah.
- Why?

24:02.076 --> 24:03.911
Why would they smuggle
so much drug money at once

24:03.945 --> 24:05.012
and take the risk?

24:05.445 --> 24:07.548
They bought on an inspector,
they had an in...

24:07.581 --> 24:09.717
Who knows?
Shit happens. You know?

24:09.750 --> 24:12.019
Explains why everyone
in Baja has been after us.

24:13.220 --> 24:15.589
That's like 500,000 dollars,

24:15.623 --> 24:17.191
and you just decided

24:17.224 --> 24:19.694
to take a joyride to
your daughter's wedding, today.

24:19.727 --> 24:20.728
Look...

24:21.729 --> 24:23.064
Kill me, man.

24:23.097 --> 24:24.832
See it like
an opportunity, all right?

24:24.865 --> 24:26.801
But, I know they're gonna
wanna have it back, so...

24:26.834 --> 24:28.002
- I get it.
- Yeah? Yeah.

24:28.636 --> 24:29.770
Look.

24:29.804 --> 24:31.105
Hey.

24:31.138 --> 24:33.473
Unless,
we make a run with it, or...

24:34.976 --> 24:36.143
You make a run with it.

24:36.677 --> 24:38.112
You know what it's like

24:38.145 --> 24:39.613
to have guys
like this after you?

24:39.647 --> 24:40.548
I do.

24:41.148 --> 24:42.984
Too well. But...

24:43.017 --> 24:44.185
just change cars.

24:44.218 --> 24:45.219
That'll take time.

24:46.821 --> 24:48.856
And then we'll actually
be in a stolen car,

24:50.024 --> 24:51.192
that was reported.

24:53.127 --> 24:54.862
So what's the idea, then, champ?

24:56.697 --> 24:59.600
Drive the car down the coast
and take it straight to Jefe.

24:59.633 --> 25:00.735
And give the money back?

25:02.937 --> 25:04.238
It's the shortest distance

25:04.271 --> 25:05.906
between here
and not getting killed.

25:05.940 --> 25:06.974
I get it. Let's go.

25:21.122 --> 25:22.156
Cully!

25:26.761 --> 25:28.863
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

25:29.363 --> 25:30.931
Sorry.

25:30.965 --> 25:33.167
You wanna ride in the front,
or in the trunk?

25:33.200 --> 25:34.635
I'll ride wherever
you want me to

25:34.668 --> 25:36.003
as long as you don't kill me.

25:37.304 --> 25:38.773
Get in the front.

25:41.075 --> 25:42.176
Lalo!

25:42.676 --> 25:44.111
- What happened?
- Lalo!

25:44.145 --> 25:45.212
They got away.

25:45.246 --> 25:46.847
- Where's Paco?
- They...

25:46.881 --> 25:48.282
Where's my brother?

25:48.315 --> 25:49.183
They shot him
on the street, <i>ese</i>.

25:50.284 --> 25:51.218
Lalo?

25:52.720 --> 25:54.021
They shot Emma and got away.

25:54.055 --> 25:55.723
They still have the money car.

25:58.959 --> 26:00.061
Call the boys.

26:00.094 --> 26:01.028
Call everyone!

26:13.641 --> 26:14.675
Fuck! Fuck! Fuck!

27:08.028 --> 27:09.663
Hey. What luck.

27:13.434 --> 27:15.236
What, you got
a little car trouble?

27:16.036 --> 27:16.971
Yeah.

27:17.738 --> 27:19.240
Actually, my, uh...

27:19.273 --> 27:21.342
my friend's
gonna be here soon, he...

27:22.276 --> 27:24.145
He knows exactly where I am.

27:24.178 --> 27:25.946
And right now, he, uh...

27:25.980 --> 27:27.781
- He should be here...-
- Relax.

27:29.717 --> 27:31.285
I'm sorry about that back there.

27:32.486 --> 27:34.088
No hard feelings, huh?

27:34.121 --> 27:36.423
No. No hard feelings.
No hard feelings.

27:37.892 --> 27:39.393
Been lookin' for this car.

27:39.426 --> 27:42.196
We weren't sure if maybe
you had somethin' to do with it.

27:43.731 --> 27:44.398
A car?

27:45.099 --> 27:47.735
Money car.
Loaded down with eight bills.

27:48.936 --> 27:49.970
I, uh...

27:50.004 --> 27:51.939
Guy named Culpeper stole it.

27:53.374 --> 27:54.675
You know him?

27:58.779 --> 27:59.780
Who?

28:03.117 --> 28:04.852
Why don't you just hop in?

28:05.520 --> 28:07.054
Come on.

28:07.087 --> 28:08.756
Well, I should
wait for my friend.

28:08.789 --> 28:10.958
- He's gonna be here.
- Oh, that could be hours.

28:10.991 --> 28:12.193
Come on.

28:12.226 --> 28:13.127
Well...

28:13.794 --> 28:15.896
I'm not in a hurry
to go anywhere, so I...-

28:15.930 --> 28:17.698
Don't be stupid, Crystal!

28:18.866 --> 28:19.767
Come on.

28:20.301 --> 28:21.402
Tell you what.
Why don't you and I

28:21.435 --> 28:23.137
take out this Culpeper guy,

28:23.572 --> 28:26.073
I'll take you back to Jefe,
we'll clear the air.

28:26.941 --> 28:28.008
It'll be fine.

28:29.777 --> 28:30.978
Come on.

28:33.948 --> 28:34.848
Shit.

28:39.453 --> 28:40.387
Okay.

28:49.964 --> 28:50.998
Good girl.

29:11.553 --> 29:13.153
What the hell?

29:14.421 --> 29:16.824
Goddamn traffic.

29:18.058 --> 29:19.960
Must be a accident.

29:21.295 --> 29:22.196
Shit.

29:31.405 --> 29:33.340
Where am I gonna go?

29:33.374 --> 29:34.308
Nowhere.

29:34.341 --> 29:35.376
That's the point.

29:35.744 --> 29:38.178
Aren't we a little exposed here?

29:38.212 --> 29:39.880
- Huh?
- Yep.

29:41.549 --> 29:43.217
You should take
the three-oh-seven.

29:44.586 --> 29:46.086
One-eighty is safer.

29:46.120 --> 29:47.254
It feels sort of faster.

29:48.155 --> 29:49.423
If there's no traffic.

29:49.456 --> 29:50.858
But they're
gonna be expecting us

29:50.891 --> 29:52.092
to take the three-oh-seven.

29:52.560 --> 29:54.862
One-eighty,
with two-ninety-five.

29:54.895 --> 29:56.030
What?

29:56.063 --> 29:57.532
Back to three-oh-seven.

29:58.399 --> 30:00.234
Dude, that adds an hour!

30:00.267 --> 30:01.835
We stay out of view,

30:01.869 --> 30:03.437
and nobody gets hurt.

30:04.438 --> 30:05.573
Hey, gimme two hot dogs.

30:15.382 --> 30:16.584
Hey, homie. Check it, man.

30:16.618 --> 30:18.419
Blue car, <i>two cars back.</i>

30:33.901 --> 30:36.370
Oh, I know a place where
we can stop to eat in Rosarito,

30:36.403 --> 30:37.971
if we take the three-oh-seven,

30:38.005 --> 30:39.574
just gotta turn...
turned off right here.

30:39.607 --> 30:41.241
Is that where
your daughter's mother lives?

30:41.275 --> 30:43.444
What? Oh, no. Of course not.

30:53.487 --> 30:54.955
- Get down.
- What?

30:55.523 --> 30:57.891
Don't turn around.
We got company.

31:03.931 --> 31:04.965
Shit.

31:12.507 --> 31:13.974
Cut me out of these right now

31:14.007 --> 31:15.075
before they kill me.

31:16.143 --> 31:17.211
Come on.

31:26.554 --> 31:27.655
Shit.

31:27.689 --> 31:31.526
Just. Stay. Cool.

33:03.050 --> 33:04.151
Shit!

33:08.222 --> 33:09.223
Put it down.

33:14.361 --> 33:16.230
Get in.

33:43.490 --> 33:44.692
Get out of the car!

33:47.160 --> 33:48.630
I didn't do nothing. Hey!

33:50.632 --> 33:52.266
What the fuck, man!

34:04.846 --> 34:06.146
Fuck.

34:06.179 --> 34:07.347
I'm not gonna hurt you.

34:14.121 --> 34:14.822
Shit.

34:16.558 --> 34:17.592
What's your name?

34:25.165 --> 34:26.333
Turk.

34:35.877 --> 34:36.811
Crystal.

34:37.476 --> 34:38.378
Crystal.

34:39.413 --> 34:40.414
Who was that guy?

34:41.415 --> 34:42.315
Who?

34:42.349 --> 34:43.350
Who?

34:44.384 --> 34:45.820
The bald guy with the Beretta.

34:47.589 --> 34:48.487
You mean Angel.

34:50.290 --> 34:51.693
He, uh...

34:51.726 --> 34:54.194
He's a hit man,
work for a mob boss. Jefe.

34:55.630 --> 34:56.764
Jefe.

34:57.565 --> 34:58.666
I know Jefe.

35:00.500 --> 35:01.703
Who were the other dudes?

35:02.837 --> 35:03.838
Just locals.

35:06.507 --> 35:08.108
Must know about the money.

35:09.276 --> 35:10.545
You know this guy Cully?

35:11.579 --> 35:13.581
He used to work for, Jefe.

35:14.448 --> 35:15.382
He was a...

35:16.651 --> 35:17.552
driver.

35:19.286 --> 35:20.287
Driver, like smuggler.

35:21.522 --> 35:22.523
Like bodyguard?

35:23.891 --> 35:26.193
Like a guy, with a funny hat.

36:03.731 --> 36:04.699
So...

36:05.265 --> 36:08.503
He just decided to steal
a car full of money one day.

36:10.505 --> 36:12.507
He saw the chance, I guess.

36:14.809 --> 36:16.443
Where do you think he's goin'?

36:20.715 --> 36:21.783
His daughter.

36:24.251 --> 36:26.420
Somethin' about
his daughter gettin' married.

36:32.292 --> 36:33.895
What do you mean,
they got the car?

36:33.928 --> 36:35.362
He took it.

36:35.395 --> 36:36.831
Who?

36:36.864 --> 36:38.398
That Cully guy.
He took it and headed south.

36:40.467 --> 36:41.903
Fuck them!

36:58.853 --> 36:59.954
There were others.

37:01.622 --> 37:03.390
- Who else?
- A crazy dude.

37:04.025 --> 37:05.258
Bald.

37:05.292 --> 37:06.627
Shot the whole place up.

37:06.661 --> 37:08.395
There's a <i>gringo</i>
and a woman, too.

37:09.429 --> 37:10.330
All right.

37:11.132 --> 37:12.967
I think I know
where they are going.

37:14.969 --> 37:15.903
Luis?

37:17.505 --> 37:19.006
Get my cousin on a clean phone.

37:20.340 --> 37:21.274
Go.

37:22.409 --> 37:23.343
Go!

37:32.987 --> 37:34.454
<i>Gracias, mamacita!</i>

40:07.742 --> 40:08.643
Hi.

40:16.083 --> 40:17.018
Don't worry.

40:17.785 --> 40:18.719
Are you okay?

40:20.054 --> 40:21.789
- Where's Emma?
- She's fine.

40:23.758 --> 40:25.126
Um, we don't have her?

40:25.693 --> 40:27.128
Now won't you shut up, man?

40:28.029 --> 40:28.930
Huh?

40:31.832 --> 40:33.167
I'm sure you know
my cousin Marcos.

40:33.200 --> 40:34.936
- Huh?
- Marcos.

40:34.969 --> 40:36.837
Oh.

40:36.871 --> 40:39.073
Yeah, well, he sent us out to
go look for your daughter, but...

40:39.907 --> 40:40.942
your wife will do.

40:40.975 --> 40:42.076
Why?

40:42.510 --> 40:44.078
Well, you're gonna do
a little job for us, man.

40:44.111 --> 40:45.179
We got a proposition for you.

40:45.212 --> 40:46.614
Like what?

40:47.048 --> 40:49.482
You're gonna whack Jefe.
You gonna kill him by tomorrow.

40:50.251 --> 40:52.520
Me?

40:52.553 --> 40:54.956
You want me to kill
the biggest drug lord in Baja?

40:54.989 --> 40:56.257
Really?

40:58.192 --> 41:00.094
- Hilarious, right?
- Yeah, I think so.

41:01.696 --> 41:03.531
Yeah. That's exactly
what you gonna do.

41:03.564 --> 41:05.933
And then you gonna deliver
the car with the money in it.

41:05.967 --> 41:06.968
Either that...

41:07.902 --> 41:09.236
or you never see her again.

41:11.205 --> 41:12.273
Oh.

41:12.306 --> 41:13.207
Mm.

41:14.108 --> 41:15.009
Hey?

41:20.848 --> 41:22.616
Are you a sick man?

41:22.650 --> 41:23.951
You telling me that
you would orphan your daughter?

41:23.985 --> 41:25.252
Why, hang on, no.

41:25.286 --> 41:27.054
Oh, I mean...
Yeah, I know. I know.

41:27.088 --> 41:28.622
No-I mean, of course.

41:31.158 --> 41:33.060
Huh? You would
make your daughter motherless,

41:33.094 --> 41:34.628
- is that what you're sayin'?
- Maybe.

41:34.662 --> 41:36.530
I mean, have you
spent any time with her?

41:36.564 --> 41:39.533
Fuck you, Cully, you prick!
Get me out of here!

41:39.567 --> 41:41.569
I'm workin' on it, okay?
But I gotta like you, okay?

41:41.602 --> 41:42.770
Help me, okay?
You gotta help me out here.

41:42.803 --> 41:44.005
Hey, shut up, man!

41:44.038 --> 41:45.506
Where's the car?

41:46.140 --> 41:47.208
What car?

41:47.241 --> 41:49.110
The car with the money in it!

41:49.143 --> 41:51.979
Um, I don't believe I know
what you're talking about, sir.

41:52.013 --> 41:53.981
Just give them the car already.

41:54.415 --> 41:56.117
I can't give them, I don't
have...

41:56.150 --> 41:57.852
I don't have the car, Maria!
I can't give it to 'em!

41:57.885 --> 41:58.953
Liar!

41:58.986 --> 42:00.688
Because you steal everything!

42:00.721 --> 42:02.156
Of course he has it!

42:02.189 --> 42:04.258
He stole my mother's earrings
and sold them.

42:04.291 --> 42:06.327
One time-You burned my clothes!

42:06.360 --> 42:08.062
You screwed that
cheap waitress at the bar!

42:08.095 --> 42:09.730
She wasn't, she was
a thousand dollars an hour!

42:09.764 --> 42:11.766
- And we were separated!
- Shut the hell up!

42:12.366 --> 42:14.101
Enough already, man.
I get it, man.

42:14.135 --> 42:16.604
The both of you guys
don't like each other, right?

42:16.637 --> 42:17.571
Look, man, what...

42:18.372 --> 42:20.074
Where's-where's your daughter?

42:20.541 --> 42:21.976
- Out.
- Out where?

42:22.343 --> 42:24.111
I don't know.
She's out with friends.

42:24.712 --> 42:26.714
Wait, wait, wait, back up, man.
You guys mean to tell me

42:26.747 --> 42:27.915
you don't even know
where your own daughter's at?

42:27.948 --> 42:29.683
- Huh?
- She's a grown woman!

42:29.717 --> 42:30.851
She's 18, man!

42:31.652 --> 42:33.054
You know what, man?

42:33.087 --> 42:34.622
The both of you guys
are terrible parents.

42:34.655 --> 42:35.689
Check yourself.
Terrible parents, my ass!

42:35.723 --> 42:37.024
I gave that girl everything!

42:37.058 --> 42:37.958
I mean... I mean,
we gave her everything.

42:37.992 --> 42:39.126
- I mean...
- What?

42:39.160 --> 42:40.194
- I mean, more Maria.
- What?

42:40.227 --> 42:41.862
More Maria, gave her everything.

42:41.896 --> 42:42.930
Why don't you give me
my damn child support?

42:42.963 --> 42:44.298
Oh, god. Child support!

42:44.331 --> 42:45.800
I'm so tired of child support!

42:45.833 --> 42:47.168
I'm workin' on it, all right!
I...

42:47.201 --> 42:49.070
Oh, you've been
working on it for years!

42:49.103 --> 42:50.071
Shut up!

42:50.104 --> 42:51.772
All right. Listen, man.

42:51.806 --> 42:53.808
May-maybe this was
a mistake. You know what?

42:54.208 --> 42:55.910
I tell you what.

42:55.943 --> 42:57.111
The boys are gonna
go looking for your daughter.

42:57.144 --> 42:58.879
You're gonna whack Jefe,

42:58.913 --> 43:00.247
and then you're gonna
hand over the money in the car.

43:00.281 --> 43:01.715
And the girls,
oh, let's just say,

43:01.749 --> 43:03.384
they're gonna walk free,
all right?

43:03.417 --> 43:06.120
But before that, Lewis,
dumb shit here,

43:06.153 --> 43:08.022
he's gonna take you to the car,

43:08.055 --> 43:09.857
and you know
where the keys are at.

43:11.792 --> 43:12.893
Oh. What keys?

43:16.831 --> 43:18.132
I remember something.

43:18.165 --> 43:19.767
I'm sorry. You mean the...

43:19.800 --> 43:21.235
You must mean the...
these keys right here.

43:23.104 --> 43:25.272
Yeah. All of a sudden
your memory's back, huh?

43:25.306 --> 43:27.141
Well, the shotgun helped me out.
It jogged my memory.

43:27.174 --> 43:28.943
Yeah, it does that sometimes.
Man, shut him the hell up!

43:28.976 --> 43:30.111
Sorry.

43:30.144 --> 43:31.178
- Shut him up!
- I'm sorry.

43:34.081 --> 43:35.749
You work for Jefe, too?

43:37.952 --> 43:38.853
No.

43:39.887 --> 43:41.355
Just a freelance contract.

43:42.056 --> 43:42.957
Retrieval.

43:44.024 --> 43:45.126
The guy Cully?

43:46.727 --> 43:48.362
More his car, it seems.

43:48.395 --> 43:49.296
But yeah.

43:57.338 --> 43:58.239
Look.

43:59.039 --> 43:59.940
I can help you.

44:01.242 --> 44:02.910
I don't need the liability.

44:05.746 --> 44:07.882
The daughter's
getting married tomorrow.

44:07.915 --> 44:08.782
Yeah?

44:09.350 --> 44:12.086
You know what brides go,
before their weddings?

44:14.355 --> 44:15.289
Whoo!

44:21.028 --> 44:22.129
Okay.

44:22.631 --> 44:24.031
Do you know a lot of background

44:24.064 --> 44:25.933
in bachelorette
hangouts, do you?

44:27.101 --> 44:28.035
What do you want?

44:31.405 --> 44:32.339
A cut.

44:33.474 --> 44:34.375
No.

44:36.477 --> 44:37.378
A small cut.

44:37.778 --> 44:39.313
Couple of.

44:40.848 --> 44:41.749
No.

44:43.417 --> 44:45.019
What you gonna tell Jefe?

44:45.052 --> 44:46.253
When you come up dry.

44:46.787 --> 44:48.455
Is he gonna believe you,

44:48.489 --> 44:50.858
or he's gonna think,
maybe, you took the money?

44:53.294 --> 44:55.396
Let's call it, sub-contract.

44:58.999 --> 44:59.967
A kickback.

45:01.001 --> 45:01.902
Whatever.

45:04.205 --> 45:05.339
I know the town.

45:05.372 --> 45:06.907
I know how to find the daughter.

45:06.941 --> 45:08.976
And then we can
trace her back to Cully.

45:11.345 --> 45:12.346
Sounds good?

45:15.282 --> 45:16.450
All right.

45:18.085 --> 45:19.820
- Let's go!
- Shup up, already.

45:34.802 --> 45:36.538
Hey, man.
Aren't you gonna flood it?

45:36.571 --> 45:38.239
Oh, no, it's fine.
Fine, it's all right.

45:40.341 --> 45:41.275
Damn!

45:41.842 --> 45:44.778
Maybe you're right.
I gotta have a look. Yeah.

45:45.513 --> 45:46.447
Real quick.

45:51.151 --> 45:52.920
Hey, pop...
pop the trunk, will you?

45:53.487 --> 45:54.855
Yeah, right there.

45:54.888 --> 45:56.090
Great.

45:57.191 --> 45:58.292
Come here, gimme a hand, man.

45:58.325 --> 45:59.893
Come on.
You want the car or not?

45:59.927 --> 46:01.262
Come on. Give me a hand.

46:01.295 --> 46:02.263
Right there,
right there, right there.

46:03.598 --> 46:04.498
Oh, shit.

46:05.899 --> 46:07.234
Put your hand right there.

46:07.268 --> 46:08.869
Yeah.

46:08.902 --> 46:09.937
Yeah, both hands, man.
You want the car or not?

46:09.970 --> 46:11.005
- Here?
- Yeah, right.

46:11.038 --> 46:12.473
- Now, don't move.
- Okay.

46:12.507 --> 46:14.275
Don't move.

46:15.376 --> 46:17.044
Ready?

46:20.548 --> 46:22.416
I flooded it, man.
You were right.

47:20.575 --> 47:22.142
I would have
loved to take you out...

47:22.176 --> 47:23.210
You still can!

47:23.578 --> 47:25.079
I can't. You're already taken.

47:26.480 --> 47:28.550
I'm still single
for a few more hours, you know?

47:28.583 --> 47:29.651
Honey, guess who?

47:29.684 --> 47:31.218
Daddy?

47:31.251 --> 47:32.986
It's me! Let's go.
We gotta go. Time to go.

47:33.655 --> 47:35.356
Hey, dude.

47:35.389 --> 47:36.624
Take your hand off me
or I'll cut your arm off!

47:36.658 --> 47:38.325
- Daddy!
- No-Honey, I'm just joking.

47:38.359 --> 47:40.260
How are you?
It's so good to see you.

48:04.118 --> 48:05.986
Look.

48:06.019 --> 48:07.988
You are entirely too young to be
drinking at a place like this.

48:08.021 --> 48:09.990
- I am a grown woman!
- You are a little girl.

48:10.023 --> 48:12.359
- I'm getting married tomorrow.
- And who's that guy?

48:12.393 --> 48:13.961
I don't know, some guy.

48:13.994 --> 48:15.262
Okay, where's the other guy,
the fiancé?

48:15.295 --> 48:16.531
I don't know.

48:16.564 --> 48:18.365
Okay, how long ago
did you meet him?

48:19.099 --> 48:20.067
Three years.

48:20.501 --> 48:21.502
How old is he?

48:21.536 --> 48:23.036
Twenty-one.

48:23.070 --> 48:24.639
Okay. You were 15 years old?

48:25.005 --> 48:27.609
What kinda guy
dates a fifteen-year old girl?

48:27.642 --> 48:29.943
We didn't-I just liked him.

48:30.545 --> 48:31.546
We dated later.

48:32.179 --> 48:33.213
Come here.

48:33.581 --> 48:35.617
It's okay, too.
Whatever the answer is.

48:36.718 --> 48:38.452
- Are you pregnant?
- No!

48:43.190 --> 48:44.258
Um...

48:48.228 --> 48:49.664
When this is over...

48:50.130 --> 48:51.999
- I wanna meet him, okay?
- Okay?

48:52.032 --> 48:54.602
Let's... let's go.
We gotta go, really fast, okay.

48:54.636 --> 48:56.538
- When what is over?
- Don't worry about it.

49:04.077 --> 49:06.046
Down!

49:10.652 --> 49:11.619
Go! Go! Go!

49:41.649 --> 49:43.217
Emma!

49:43.250 --> 49:45.018
I'm with your father,
you'll see. Come!

49:45.052 --> 49:46.119
Come with me!

51:22.717 --> 51:23.618
Freeze!

51:37.699 --> 51:39.399
Oh my god, he's shooting at us!

51:56.884 --> 51:58.820
What are you doing here?
What are you doing here?

51:58.853 --> 52:00.555
- Put it down.
- Hey, Turk.

52:00.588 --> 52:01.522
It-it's empty.

52:02.690 --> 52:03.925
Cully?

52:03.958 --> 52:05.258
Daddy!

52:05.292 --> 52:06.393
Daddy!

52:06.426 --> 52:07.862
- Don't...
- My daughter!

52:07.895 --> 52:09.329
- Don't do it.
- My daughter, man. I gotta...-

52:09.363 --> 52:10.397
- Don't do it.
- I gotta go, man.

52:13.367 --> 52:14.468
Go!

52:37.659 --> 52:38.559
Okay. Okay.

52:50.738 --> 52:51.639
Oh, shit.

53:00.014 --> 53:01.181
Come on.

53:08.890 --> 53:10.424
Daddy! Daddy!

53:10.858 --> 53:11.959
It's okay, honey.

53:11.993 --> 53:13.961
It's okay. It's okay.

53:13.995 --> 53:15.997
No, it's not okay.
Where's the car!

53:16.030 --> 53:18.733
Um, I don't know, man.
Where'd you park it, dude?

53:18.766 --> 53:20.300
Cully, just tell them.

53:20.333 --> 53:21.736
- What?
- Just tell them!

53:21.769 --> 53:23.671
You know what,
you're never on my side!

53:23.705 --> 53:25.873
Never on my side. Ever!

53:25.907 --> 53:27.340
Why are you never on my team?

53:27.374 --> 53:28.576
What are you talking about?

53:28.609 --> 53:29.977
Like when
we were to get married,

53:30.011 --> 53:30.978
your father said
I'd never amount to anything

53:31.012 --> 53:32.580
but like a punk and a...

53:32.613 --> 53:34.347
you know,
hoodlum and a crook, you know?

53:34.381 --> 53:35.717
So, you're not.

53:35.750 --> 53:37.417
That's true. It's a bad example.

53:37.451 --> 53:38.820
Daddy, just give them the car!

53:38.853 --> 53:41.556
Um-How could you
let her marry this guy?

53:41.589 --> 53:43.356
What, like it's
not her decision?

53:43.958 --> 53:46.326
Uh-he's not
good enough for her!

53:46.359 --> 53:47.394
You don't even know him!

53:47.427 --> 53:48.629
I know him. I know the type.

53:48.663 --> 53:49.931
God, I know him.

53:49.964 --> 53:51.465
He's always hustlin',

53:51.498 --> 53:52.934
looking for the angle,
bullshittin'...

53:52.967 --> 53:54.635
- Oh. Well, you mean like you.
- No, like him.

53:56.003 --> 53:57.638
- Damn.
- Where's the goddamn car, man?

53:57.672 --> 53:59.507
Enough of this bullshit
already, all right?

53:59.540 --> 54:00.942
I'm done playing
with your ass, man!

54:00.975 --> 54:02.577
Where's the car?

54:02.610 --> 54:03.911
And she's too young!

54:03.945 --> 54:05.646
She's the same age we were!

54:05.680 --> 54:07.280
Exactly! Look at you,
you're a wreck!

54:07.314 --> 54:09.382
- You've proved my point!
- Daddy, stop!

54:09.416 --> 54:10.752
Just give them the car.

54:10.785 --> 54:12.352
Young lady,
listen to your father.

54:12.385 --> 54:13.955
Relax.

54:13.988 --> 54:15.422
For your mother and father
are trying to have a talk.

54:15.455 --> 54:16.824
What's she
supposed to do, Cully?

54:16.858 --> 54:18.391
You're never around.

54:18.425 --> 54:20.027
You've never been
here to support her.

54:24.464 --> 54:25.432
Here's the deal.

54:25.900 --> 54:27.367
No more playin', all right?

54:27.400 --> 54:28.770
You tell me
where the car is, man,

54:28.803 --> 54:30.538
or it's your last day today.

54:30.571 --> 54:31.773
Um, hang on.

54:33.107 --> 54:34.374
No

54:34.407 --> 54:35.408
Okay.

54:35.810 --> 54:37.310
She goes first, you get it?

54:37.779 --> 54:38.880
She goes first!

54:38.913 --> 54:39.847
Where's the car?

54:41.448 --> 54:42.884
You gotta listen to me, man.

54:42.917 --> 54:43.951
Everything,

54:44.552 --> 54:47.855
that I value, and have,
in the world, is in this room.

54:48.756 --> 54:50.091
Now you pull that trigger,

54:50.124 --> 54:51.826
and I ain't got
nothin' to lose, brother.

54:51.859 --> 54:53.460
Nothin'.

54:53.493 --> 54:56.597
And you, and no one, ever,
see that money.

54:57.965 --> 54:59.700
You a funny guy, huh?

54:59.734 --> 55:01.636
- I ain't funny at all.
- Huh, you're crackin' jokes.

55:01.669 --> 55:03.971
You actually do
got a valid point, though, man.

55:05.773 --> 55:07.542
I never gave anything, Maria,

55:07.575 --> 55:08.475
until now.

55:10.611 --> 55:12.445
And now I'm
doin' somethin' for you.

55:13.714 --> 55:14.749
Where would they go?

55:15.850 --> 55:17.585
I don't know. I don't know.

55:18.753 --> 55:21.022
A safe house,
maybe a drop point.

55:21.656 --> 55:24.424
They're not exactly
in the fuckin' phone book.

55:25.560 --> 55:26.961
Come on. Think.

55:31.065 --> 55:33.433
I'll kill Jefe for you
like you want.

55:33.466 --> 55:34.501
All right?

55:34.535 --> 55:36.369
You get all his shit.

55:36.403 --> 55:37.470
All his trafficking rounds,
infrastructure, everything,

55:37.505 --> 55:38.840
it's all yours.

55:38.873 --> 55:40.407
Yeah, you take his spot,

55:40.440 --> 55:41.809
and you step up,
and you're a major player.

55:41.843 --> 55:42.710
All right?

55:43.311 --> 55:45.913
All I want,
is you let my girls go.

55:47.447 --> 55:49.449
Jefe has some properties
in this area.

55:50.551 --> 55:51.819
Real estate,

55:51.853 --> 55:52.753
condos,

55:53.154 --> 55:54.454
and garages.

55:54.822 --> 55:55.823
Could be anywhere.

55:58.926 --> 56:00.127
Oh, shit.

56:00.962 --> 56:01.863
Road block.

56:02.495 --> 56:03.664
Shit.

56:10.104 --> 56:11.505
What I don't get is,

56:12.106 --> 56:13.875
why are you so into all this?

56:14.374 --> 56:16.077
You know some of these guys.

56:16.711 --> 56:18.411
Don't you wanna stay out of it?

56:18.445 --> 56:19.614
Yes, I do.

56:19.647 --> 56:20.815
I wish I could.

56:22.183 --> 56:23.684
But it's not what you think.

56:23.718 --> 56:24.819
It's not that simple.

56:26.153 --> 56:27.054
Look.

56:27.922 --> 56:28.923
You're a dancer.

56:30.490 --> 56:32.492
You can make that
kind of money in a weekend.

56:32.960 --> 56:34.762
And you won't have to
deal with all this shit.

56:34.795 --> 56:35.763
You'd be free.

56:38.199 --> 56:39.767
You don't know me. We just met.

56:40.635 --> 56:41.936
You don't know my story.

56:41.969 --> 56:43.771
You don't know
what I'm running from.

56:43.804 --> 56:45.438
Don't call me dancer!

57:13.768 --> 57:14.869
Let's put this way.

57:15.770 --> 57:18.039
It's better than being, alone.

57:18.739 --> 57:20.608
I will make sure,

57:20.641 --> 57:21.776
that nothin',

57:21.809 --> 57:23.077
nothin' at all,

57:23.110 --> 57:24.645
will ever touch you.

57:24.679 --> 57:26.113
No idea, no one got an idea,

57:26.147 --> 57:29.984
that I whacked Jefe, for you.

57:31.118 --> 57:32.019
Okay?

57:32.887 --> 57:33.921
Now you kill me,

57:33.955 --> 57:35.923
no one's gettin' nothin'.

57:35.957 --> 57:36.924
Right?

57:36.958 --> 57:38.092
So, take the deal.

57:38.626 --> 57:41.028
'Cause most likely
I'm not gonna make it out alive.

57:41.062 --> 57:42.129
Either way...

57:42.663 --> 57:44.732
your next birthday,
you're really rich.

57:44.765 --> 57:45.633
Really rich.

57:46.200 --> 57:47.568
You got my attention.

57:48.069 --> 57:50.805
He's a dead man walkin',
he just doesn't know it yet.

57:52.807 --> 57:53.975
He's a dead man.

57:55.576 --> 57:56.544
Hang tight.

57:57.645 --> 57:59.113
I'm gonna move the pins.

58:28.142 --> 58:29.176
Asshole!

58:35.082 --> 58:36.584
We're workin' together.

01:01:40.334 --> 01:01:42.436
Too many Cubans.

01:01:47.107 --> 01:01:52.079
They give you these tanks
to keep you alive.

01:01:53.180 --> 01:01:54.815
But all they really mean is

01:01:54.848 --> 01:01:57.985
you're dying
a slow, painful death.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:01.388
Thank you for coming.

01:02:02.389 --> 01:02:03.424
I lost the car.

01:02:04.191 --> 01:02:05.426
But I can get it back.

01:02:06.360 --> 01:02:07.962
I need some information,

01:02:07.995 --> 01:02:09.330
on your driver Cully.

01:02:18.540 --> 01:02:19.473
Jefe?

01:02:24.278 --> 01:02:26.514
She must have been screwing him.

01:02:26.548 --> 01:02:29.750
Hell, she was probably
fucking half my men.

01:02:30.552 --> 01:02:33.187
I saw how he looked at her.

01:02:33.821 --> 01:02:37.992
And I saw how
she looked at all of them.

01:02:39.493 --> 01:02:41.929
But, I understand

01:02:43.565 --> 01:02:45.866
what it must be like

01:02:45.899 --> 01:02:49.303
to be married
to someone half dead,

01:02:49.336 --> 01:02:51.438
twice your age.

01:02:52.473 --> 01:02:53.374
Married?

01:02:54.942 --> 01:02:56.844
I've reason to believe

01:02:57.278 --> 01:03:01.415
her life is in danger
from a madman.

01:03:01.448 --> 01:03:02.416
Yeah.

01:03:03.284 --> 01:03:04.318
I think we met.

01:03:05.953 --> 01:03:08.523
- Why did you send him?
- I didn't.

01:03:08.956 --> 01:03:12.359
Angel was my best wet worker.

01:03:12.393 --> 01:03:16.130
Twenty years,
and now he's gone off the map.

01:03:18.265 --> 01:03:21.101
It's not your problem any more.

01:03:21.135 --> 01:03:23.370
I'll take it from here.

01:03:26.940 --> 01:03:28.208
You want me off the job?

01:03:29.009 --> 01:03:30.210
He has her.

01:03:31.812 --> 01:03:34.348
And there's only one place

01:03:34.381 --> 01:03:37.951
that sick bastard
works someone over.

01:03:50.565 --> 01:03:51.999
No!

01:03:52.032 --> 01:03:54.134
Get off of me!

01:03:54.168 --> 01:03:56.571
That goddamn fetishist,

01:03:56.604 --> 01:03:58.172
it's not Christian.

01:03:58.205 --> 01:04:01.308
I'm done being delicate.

01:04:01.342 --> 01:04:03.310
I'm sending my own people.

01:04:03.344 --> 01:04:05.913
They'll bring her back
where she belongs,

01:04:05.946 --> 01:04:07.247
with me.

01:04:08.449 --> 01:04:10.184
What about the money car?

01:04:10.217 --> 01:04:13.320
She'll tell me where it is.

01:04:15.690 --> 01:04:19.159
She's just not thinking clearly.

01:04:21.061 --> 01:04:22.429
She really

01:04:23.263 --> 01:04:25.332
does love me.

01:04:26.233 --> 01:04:27.134
I bet.

01:04:27.702 --> 01:04:29.236
Don't judge me, Turk.

01:04:30.638 --> 01:04:33.374
When you're counting down
your final hours,

01:04:33.407 --> 01:04:35.342
you realize
how all you really have

01:04:35.376 --> 01:04:38.513
is your family and your legacy.

01:04:38.546 --> 01:04:41.315
Do not judge.

01:04:45.452 --> 01:04:48.222
You'll get paid on your way out.

01:04:49.189 --> 01:04:50.157
Turk.

01:04:59.634 --> 01:05:01.969
Don't judge.

01:07:03.090 --> 01:07:05.492
- Oh, shit.
- Come here often?

01:07:56.778 --> 01:07:57.812
You!

01:08:04.619 --> 01:08:05.520
Shit.

01:08:07.555 --> 01:08:08.488
Missed me?

01:08:15.162 --> 01:08:16.196
Where's the money?

01:08:21.368 --> 01:08:23.370
What do you mean?
Where's the dancer, man?

01:08:23.837 --> 01:08:24.738
Huh?

01:08:29.644 --> 01:08:31.111
One of two things has happened.

01:08:32.412 --> 01:08:34.616
Either Jefe's operators
got to her in time

01:08:34.649 --> 01:08:36.316
and she's back at the casino,

01:08:36.350 --> 01:08:37.417
or,

01:08:37.885 --> 01:08:40.187
they knocked on the door
and found her cut to pieces.

01:08:40.220 --> 01:08:41.889
No.
Angel likes to take his time,

01:08:41.923 --> 01:08:43.558
the sick bastard that he is.

01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:45.760
He's a goddamn fetishist
or some shit, you know?

01:08:46.326 --> 01:08:47.493
Yeah.

01:08:47.528 --> 01:08:48.428
I've heard.

01:08:52.834 --> 01:08:54.167
You're going back for the girl.

01:08:54.201 --> 01:08:55.603
Yeah.

01:08:55.636 --> 01:08:57.237
We gotta get movin'. Let's go.

01:08:58.372 --> 01:08:59.339
There's no 'we.'

01:09:01.308 --> 01:09:02.442
I need your help, man.

01:09:03.176 --> 01:09:05.613
Why? Because
I can't do it alone.

01:09:06.212 --> 01:09:08.381
It's the only way
to keep my family safe.

01:09:08.415 --> 01:09:09.917
Because I owe her.

01:09:09.951 --> 01:09:12.386
And because that asthmatic
motherfucker stiffed you.

01:09:12.787 --> 01:09:15.523
And I can get you
your cut of the money back,

01:09:15.555 --> 01:09:17.558
okay? So what do you
think about that, huh?

01:09:17.591 --> 01:09:18.492
What do you say?

01:09:21.461 --> 01:09:22.796
Half.

01:09:22.830 --> 01:09:24.497
Oh, come on.
Standard cut, we're not...

01:09:24.532 --> 01:09:26.533
- Fifty percent.
- Fine. Good.

01:09:26.567 --> 01:09:27.466
And I'm drivin'.

01:09:27.501 --> 01:09:28.502
No, no, but...

01:09:28.536 --> 01:09:29.569
I'm drivin'.

01:09:29.604 --> 01:09:30.805
Okay, asshole. There you go.

01:09:31.872 --> 01:09:33.407
So, uh, you don't strike me

01:09:33.439 --> 01:09:35.242
as someone who has
gone out of the way

01:09:35.274 --> 01:09:36.810
that often to help many people.

01:09:36.844 --> 01:09:38.345
So tell me, uh...

01:09:38.377 --> 01:09:39.781
which part of
my speech was it that,

01:09:39.814 --> 01:09:42.215
- you know, convinced you?
- Get in the car.

01:10:05.540 --> 01:10:06.808
It's okay.

01:10:07.542 --> 01:10:08.543
You're home.

01:10:10.812 --> 01:10:12.245
I'm done with you.

01:10:13.548 --> 01:10:14.448
I'm done.

01:10:19.954 --> 01:10:20.855
Fuck.

01:10:23.691 --> 01:10:25.927
I don't want your fucking ring!

01:10:25.960 --> 01:10:27.327
Bastard!

01:10:30.363 --> 01:10:34.501
I fell in love with you
for your passion.

01:10:35.435 --> 01:10:38.706
But you've never known
what's best for you.

01:11:14.842 --> 01:11:15.777
Hey.

01:11:17.845 --> 01:11:18.813
What are you doin'?

01:11:19.279 --> 01:11:20.748
What are you doin' now?

01:11:20.782 --> 01:11:21.949
Just tryin' to
remember where I am.

01:11:21.983 --> 01:11:22.917
What?

01:11:24.351 --> 01:11:25.686
You...

01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:27.588
I thought you said
you knew this place.

01:11:28.455 --> 01:11:31.559
I've only been here once.
Cut me some slack.

01:11:39.466 --> 01:11:41.869
Angel.

01:11:41.903 --> 01:11:43.638
Shit.

01:11:43.671 --> 01:11:45.907
Oh, shit.

01:11:51.378 --> 01:11:53.080
You got your hands full,
don't you?

01:12:45.199 --> 01:12:46.100
Cully?

01:12:46.801 --> 01:12:47.702
Yeah?

01:12:48.836 --> 01:12:49.770
Come on.

01:12:50.605 --> 01:12:51.505
Oh. Yeah.

01:12:51.539 --> 01:12:52.439
Come on.

01:12:55.509 --> 01:12:56.811
They're coming for you.

01:12:56.844 --> 01:12:58.746
He's coming for both of us.

01:13:18.599 --> 01:13:19.934
- Huh? Go, go, go.
- Hey!

01:13:26.674 --> 01:13:27.675
Right there.

01:13:32.880 --> 01:13:34.181
- Over there.
- Get to cover!

01:13:34.215 --> 01:13:35.149
- What?
- There!

01:13:35.182 --> 01:13:36.183
- What?
- Move!

01:13:37.118 --> 01:13:38.019
Go!

01:13:41.255 --> 01:13:42.422
Oh my god. How...

01:13:47.194 --> 01:13:48.596
What's he sayin'?

01:13:48.629 --> 01:13:50.197
Oh, it's not good.
Not good at all.

01:14:02.209 --> 01:14:04.178
Follow me. Over my head.

01:14:41.816 --> 01:14:42.783
Asshole!

01:15:05.139 --> 01:15:08.075
Now that...
was a giant pain in the neck.

01:15:08.843 --> 01:15:09.777
Obviously.

01:15:32.233 --> 01:15:33.968
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:15:41.942 --> 01:15:42.910
Let's get 'em.

01:16:00.227 --> 01:16:01.595
Fuck!

01:16:06.200 --> 01:16:07.868
Move!

01:16:31.659 --> 01:16:32.561
Come on.

01:16:48.709 --> 01:16:50.277
I forgive you

01:16:51.679 --> 01:16:52.947
for leaving.

01:16:54.215 --> 01:16:55.683
I did not ask.

01:16:58.085 --> 01:17:00.287
I gave you everything.

01:17:00.321 --> 01:17:01.889
Everything.

01:17:02.490 --> 01:17:05.259
You tried to buy me,
like a trick.

01:17:05.793 --> 01:17:08.062
Like a goddamn.

01:17:09.263 --> 01:17:11.132
And I let you believe you could.

01:17:18.405 --> 01:17:19.907
You can't buy me.

01:17:25.713 --> 01:17:28.749
You're a bitter, sad, sad man.

01:17:37.725 --> 01:17:39.126
You used me.

01:17:39.160 --> 01:17:41.095
Because you know
I was afraid to be alone.

01:17:44.231 --> 01:17:45.399
What you gonna do?

01:17:47.334 --> 01:17:50.237
I'm not gonna
let anybody hurt you.

01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.742
Or me.

01:17:56.977 --> 01:18:00.247
We are gonna be
together for ever.

01:18:09.290 --> 01:18:10.958
Is this really the only way up?

01:18:12.259 --> 01:18:14.161
Jefe's a paranoid man.

01:18:41.055 --> 01:18:42.957
Hey.

01:18:45.192 --> 01:18:46.126
On my mark.

01:18:46.493 --> 01:18:48.162
Go, go.

01:18:52.199 --> 01:18:53.200
Put it down.

01:18:54.168 --> 01:18:56.203
I'm dead anyway.

01:18:56.237 --> 01:18:58.239
And I'm takin' her with me.

01:18:59.073 --> 01:19:00.074
No.

01:19:00.441 --> 01:19:01.408
No, you're not.

01:19:04.111 --> 01:19:05.179
Don't do it.

01:19:05.946 --> 01:19:07.047
Go, clear!

01:19:14.488 --> 01:19:15.990
You bastard!

01:19:16.023 --> 01:19:17.424
That's what you deserve.

01:19:18.859 --> 01:19:20.361
You okay?

01:19:20.394 --> 01:19:21.428
Yeah.

01:19:22.062 --> 01:19:24.031
Huh?

01:19:26.601 --> 01:19:27.935
We gotta go.

01:19:30.938 --> 01:19:32.406
We gotta go, guys. Now!

01:19:34.441 --> 01:19:36.243
- He's right.
- Come on.

01:19:36.277 --> 01:19:37.177
Come.

01:19:51.526 --> 01:19:52.426
Watch.

01:20:06.608 --> 01:20:08.075
Oh. Hey.

01:20:08.108 --> 01:20:10.311
Hey, wait. Wait.
I have to hit the car.

01:20:10.344 --> 01:20:11.278
Why?

01:20:12.313 --> 01:20:13.814
Give me the keys. I'll do it.

01:20:15.650 --> 01:20:17.885
Hey, Turk, man.
Come on, come on, man.

01:20:18.419 --> 01:20:19.820
It's my thing, you know?

01:20:20.354 --> 01:20:21.989
It's my thing. Yeah.

01:20:22.890 --> 01:20:24.058
But Angel's out there.

01:20:24.592 --> 01:20:25.859
I'll do the car.

01:20:26.393 --> 01:20:27.461
You just stay here.

01:20:29.597 --> 01:20:32.534
All right. You're right.
Sorry, sorry, I-Here you go.

01:20:33.467 --> 01:20:34.401
Let's go.

01:20:40.274 --> 01:20:41.175
Stay here.

01:20:41.676 --> 01:20:42.577
I mean it.

01:20:43.477 --> 01:20:44.445
We will.

01:20:45.212 --> 01:20:46.581
You-be careful, okay?

01:20:46.614 --> 01:20:48.048
Wait here.

01:24:38.445 --> 01:24:39.514
Hey, white boy!

01:24:41.248 --> 01:24:44.251
What you think you're doing
with your hands on our car, huh?

01:24:48.455 --> 01:24:49.356
Drop it.

01:24:53.493 --> 01:24:54.394
Now!

01:24:59.801 --> 01:25:01.368
Let's go. Open it up.

01:25:44.946 --> 01:25:45.880
Cully!

01:25:56.423 --> 01:25:57.324
Shit!

01:27:16.838 --> 01:27:18.673
You look lovely.

01:27:19.473 --> 01:27:21.374
So, where's the kid?

01:27:21.408 --> 01:27:22.543
Calm down, Daddy.

01:27:22.577 --> 01:27:24.045
I wanna meet him, come on.

01:27:24.078 --> 01:27:25.713
Okay. Okay.

01:27:26.547 --> 01:27:27.447
Just stop.

01:27:28.348 --> 01:27:29.650
Be nice.

01:27:29.684 --> 01:27:31.018
I'm calm.

01:27:31.052 --> 01:27:32.787
You have to promise me,
you'll stay calm.

01:27:32.820 --> 01:27:35.455
I'm calm. If I were
any more calm, I'd be asleep.

01:27:35.489 --> 01:27:36.524
All right?

01:27:37.457 --> 01:27:38.458
Lido?

01:27:41.328 --> 01:27:42.262
Daddy,

01:27:43.396 --> 01:27:44.331
Lido.

01:27:47.602 --> 01:27:48.536
Hm.

01:27:51.471 --> 01:27:52.472
The boy.

01:27:52.507 --> 01:27:53.674
Sir?

01:27:53.708 --> 01:27:55.308
Real quick.

01:27:56.944 --> 01:27:59.514
Are you gonna
treat this perfect angel,

01:28:00.181 --> 01:28:02.449
like the princess
and queen that she his?

01:28:03.450 --> 01:28:04.819
- Yes, sir.
- Yeah?

01:28:05.219 --> 01:28:07.420
I mean,
everything she says is right?

01:28:07.454 --> 01:28:08.589
Everything.

01:28:08.623 --> 01:28:09.924
Yes, Ma'am. No, Ma'am.

01:28:09.957 --> 01:28:11.826
How much money
can I get you, Ma'am?

01:28:11.859 --> 01:28:12.794
All that.

01:28:14.028 --> 01:28:14.929
Yes.

01:28:14.962 --> 01:28:16.296
- Really?
- Yes.

01:28:17.865 --> 01:28:19.867
- Okay.
- Okay?

01:28:19.901 --> 01:28:21.569
Okay. You got my blessing. Yeah.

01:28:25.472 --> 01:28:26.674
Okay, honey. Congratulations.

01:28:26.707 --> 01:28:28.375
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:28:28.408 --> 01:28:29.844
Emma. What are you doing?

01:28:29.877 --> 01:28:31.779
You can't see the groom
before the wedding!

01:28:31.813 --> 01:28:33.548
Mama, don't be so superstitious.

01:28:33.581 --> 01:28:34.882
I am not being superstitious.

01:28:34.916 --> 01:28:36.617
Now come on, go get ready.

01:28:39.486 --> 01:28:40.487
Did he hit you?

01:28:41.454 --> 01:28:42.557
- Not yet.
- Good.

01:28:44.659 --> 01:28:47.360
Do me a favor
and go get the groceries for me?

01:28:47.394 --> 01:28:48.328
Yes, Ma'am.

01:28:57.470 --> 01:28:58.573
So how are you?

01:28:58.606 --> 01:28:59.507
Huh?

01:29:00.174 --> 01:29:01.609
How are you?

01:29:01.642 --> 01:29:02.510
Uh...

01:29:03.077 --> 01:29:04.579
You know-

01:29:04.612 --> 01:29:06.948
I'm fine. I'm fine. Why?

01:29:09.482 --> 01:29:11.586
Mom, should I put the dress on
now or at the church?

01:29:11.619 --> 01:29:12.687
Hey. Maria?

01:29:13.087 --> 01:29:14.555
Um...

01:29:15.723 --> 01:29:17.490
You-Maria?

01:29:19.527 --> 01:29:20.895
You're a really good child

01:29:20.928 --> 01:29:22.495
but this family...
you're a good family.

01:29:24.131 --> 01:29:25.566
Really good.

01:29:25.600 --> 01:29:26.601
We're all right.

01:29:27.735 --> 01:29:28.636
Come here.

01:29:30.705 --> 01:29:32.405
Listen to me. Um...

01:29:34.876 --> 01:29:36.143
I am so sorry.

01:29:36.544 --> 01:29:39.046
Honey, I...
I missed your whole life,

01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:41.448
and I'm your dad
and I shouldn't have missed it,

01:29:41.481 --> 01:29:43.416
but I did, and I'm sorry.

01:29:43.450 --> 01:29:44.685
It's okay, Daddy.

01:29:45.319 --> 01:29:47.588
You did the best you could.

01:29:47.622 --> 01:29:49.757
- I love you.
- You do?

01:29:49.790 --> 01:29:51.058
I love you, too.

01:29:52.526 --> 01:29:54.595
Oh, shit.

01:29:54.629 --> 01:29:55.630
Sorry.

01:30:00.902 --> 01:30:02.136
- Dad?
- Yeah?

01:30:02.169 --> 01:30:03.470
You stink.

01:30:03.503 --> 01:30:04.504
What?

01:30:04.538 --> 01:30:05.907
You need to get cleaned up

01:30:05.940 --> 01:30:08.209
if you're gonna
walk me down the aisle.

01:30:08.242 --> 01:30:09.844
I'll walk you down the aisle?

01:30:10.711 --> 01:30:11.979
Oh.

01:30:12.013 --> 01:30:13.080
Really?

01:30:42.810 --> 01:30:44.444
I got somethin' for you.

01:30:51.085 --> 01:30:52.820
Is this dirty money?

01:30:54.922 --> 01:30:55.923
It was.

01:30:57.124 --> 01:30:59.927
But now that
it's in your pristine hands,

01:31:01.195 --> 01:31:02.096
it's not.

01:31:12.707 --> 01:31:14.075
- Hey.
- They'll be looking for this.

01:31:14.108 --> 01:31:15.810
We won't be safe.

01:31:15.843 --> 01:31:17.244
They're not gonna
do anything anymore, you know.

01:31:17.278 --> 01:31:19.246
Looking, not looking,
sleeping, you know.

01:31:21.115 --> 01:31:23.584
Look.
We're free and clear, finally.

01:31:55.249 --> 01:31:56.717
Hey, look. I should go.

01:31:56.751 --> 01:31:59.086
Um, I have to find a...
suit, somewhere.

01:32:01.288 --> 01:32:02.590
You have a suit.

01:32:04.692 --> 01:32:05.626
Really?

01:32:06.127 --> 01:32:07.228
Where?

01:32:07.261 --> 01:32:09.096
Upstairs. In the closet.

01:32:10.798 --> 01:32:11.766
Sure it's mine?

01:32:12.199 --> 01:32:13.868
I thought
you've burned everything.

01:32:13.901 --> 01:32:15.069
I guess I missed one.

01:32:16.237 --> 01:32:17.805
Maria, really,
in all seriousness,

01:32:17.838 --> 01:32:19.006
do you want me to stay?

01:32:19.607 --> 01:32:20.307
Do you?

01:32:21.342 --> 01:32:23.044
I haven't asked you to leave.

01:32:45.633 --> 01:32:46.834
Jackpot.

01:32:50.371 --> 01:32:51.872
Hey.

01:32:51.906 --> 01:32:53.808
You could have
just asked for these.

01:32:56.811 --> 01:32:58.179
- Is this your money?
- No.

01:32:58.212 --> 01:32:59.847
I already have mine.

01:33:00.314 --> 01:33:01.615
I went shopping.

01:33:02.183 --> 01:33:03.751
Do you like my new dress?

01:33:07.655 --> 01:33:08.689
Yeah.

01:33:09.056 --> 01:33:10.257
That's all your money.

01:33:11.892 --> 01:33:12.827
You comin'?

01:33:14.061 --> 01:33:15.729
Which way you heading next?

01:33:17.098 --> 01:33:18.165
I don't know.

01:33:18.966 --> 01:33:20.134
Maybe south.

01:33:20.167 --> 01:33:21.168
South?

01:33:21.669 --> 01:33:23.370
I was hoping you would say that.

01:33:24.004 --> 01:33:25.239
Let's go!

01:33:30.344 --> 01:33:31.312
Hey!

01:33:32.246 --> 01:33:33.881
Hey! What the fuck?

01:33:44.992 --> 01:33:47.361
Asshole!

01:33:51.132 --> 01:33:53.067
Bad boy.

01:33:53.100 --> 01:33:54.802
Doesn't feel so good, does it?

01:33:56.470 --> 01:33:58.139
I've never felt this good,

01:33:58.540 --> 01:34:00.207
my entire life.

01:34:01.909 --> 01:34:03.811
Just drive, will you?

01:34:09.350 --> 01:34:12.086
Yeah! Come on!

01:34:48.105 --> 01:34:53.105
