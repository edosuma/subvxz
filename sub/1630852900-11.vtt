WEBVTT

00:32.132 --> 00:32.899
>> WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:32.966 --> 00:34.868
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:34.934 --> 00:35.568
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:35.635 --> 00:36.770
THANK YOU SO MUCH

00:36.836 --> 00:40.073
FOR JOINING US.

00:40.140 --> 00:41.207
IT HAS BEEN A BUSY WEEK.

00:41.274 --> 00:42.375
BONGBONG MARCOS WAS ELECTED

00:42.442 --> 00:43.042
PRESIDENT OF THE PHILIPPINES,

00:43.109 --> 00:43.643
WE SAW A PRETTY HOT PICTURE OF

00:43.710 --> 00:45.378
A BLACK HOLE, AND THE EUROVISION

00:45.445 --> 00:46.980
SONG CONTEST TOOK PLACE,

00:47.046 --> 00:48.114
FEATURING THIS SPECTACULAR ENTRY

00:48.181 --> 00:49.716
FROM NORWAY.

00:49.783 --> 00:51.217
>>

01:20.780 --> 01:22.315
>> YES.

01:22.382 --> 01:23.650
EVERY PART OF THAT

01:23.716 --> 01:25.552
GETS A BIG YES FROM ME.

01:25.618 --> 01:27.187
FROM THE DRESS CODE, WHICH CAN

01:27.253 --> 01:28.021
ONLY BE DESCRIBED AS "WEREWOLF

01:28.087 --> 01:30.723
APPLYING FOR A LOAN," TO THE

01:30.790 --> 01:31.891
SEXY BUSINESS MINION BACKUP

01:31.958 --> 01:33.493
DANCERS, TO THE FOSSE MEETS 2008

01:33.560 --> 01:35.395
GAGA CHOREOGRAPHY, TO THE LINES

01:35.462 --> 01:36.629
"IS THAT SALIVA OR BLOOD

01:36.696 --> 01:38.798
DRIPPING OFF YOUR CHIN",

01:38.865 --> 01:40.600
THE HORNIEST LYRIC SINCE

01:40.667 --> 01:41.401
ALL OF "MONTERO,"

01:41.468 --> 01:42.669
IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED BY,

01:42.735 --> 01:43.169
"IF YOU DON'T LIKE

01:43.236 --> 01:44.704
THE NAME KEITH,

01:44.771 --> 01:46.206
IMMA CALL YOU JIM"

01:46.272 --> 01:47.574
WHICH IS PURE CHAOS.

01:47.640 --> 01:48.641
THAT BAND --

01:48.708 --> 01:49.809
CALLED "SUBWOOLFER,"

01:49.876 --> 01:50.376
BY THE WAY --

01:50.443 --> 01:51.077
UNDERSTOOD EXACTLY WHAT

01:51.144 --> 01:52.812
EUROVISION IS FOR.

01:52.879 --> 01:54.247
AS, INCIDENTALLY, DID THE

01:54.314 --> 01:55.748
LATVIAN ENTRY, WHICH DIDN'T EVEN

01:55.815 --> 01:57.450
MAKE IT TO THE FINAL, DESPITE

01:57.517 --> 01:58.985
HAVING ONE OF THE BEST OPENINGS

01:59.052 --> 01:59.552
TO A SONG IN THE HISTORY OF

01:59.619 --> 02:05.992
MUSIC.

02:06.059 --> 02:09.562
>>

02:19.706 --> 02:22.775
>> I MEAN, COME ON.

02:22.842 --> 02:23.810
ARE YOU NOT ENTERTAINED?

02:23.877 --> 02:24.577
THE EUROVISION SONG

02:24.644 --> 02:25.144
CONTEST IS MAYHEM

02:25.211 --> 02:26.112
IN ALL THE BEST WAYS.

02:26.179 --> 02:26.779
BUT AS MUCH AS I'D LOVE TO SPEND

02:26.846 --> 02:27.580
THE NEXT TEN MINUTES TALKING

02:27.647 --> 02:28.147
ABOUT THAT, WE SADLY HAVE TO

02:28.214 --> 02:29.415
MOVE ON.

02:29.482 --> 02:30.683
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE THIS HAPPENED

02:30.750 --> 02:31.885
IN ALABAMA.

02:31.951 --> 02:33.052
>> THE USE OF PUBERTY BLOCKERS

02:33.119 --> 02:36.289
AND HORMONES TO TREAT

02:36.356 --> 02:36.823
TRANSGENDER MINORS IS NOW

02:36.890 --> 02:38.057
ILLEGAL IN ALABAMA.

02:38.124 --> 02:39.492
>> YEAH, THE STATE'S TRANSGENDER

02:39.559 --> 02:41.394
YOUTH BAN IS NOW IN EFFECT AND

02:41.461 --> 02:42.629
THAT MEANS IT IS NOW A FELONY

02:42.695 --> 02:43.663
FOR DOCTORS TO PROVIDE

02:43.730 --> 02:45.365
MEDICATIONS TO TRANS PEOPLE

02:45.431 --> 02:47.834
UNDER THE AGE OF 19.

02:47.901 --> 02:49.469
ALABAMA'S THE FIRST STATE TO

02:49.536 --> 02:50.103
ENACT SUCH A BAN ON THESE

02:50.169 --> 02:50.937
TREATMENTS.

02:51.004 --> 02:51.838
IT'S PUNISHABLE BY UP TO 10

02:51.905 --> 02:55.708
YEARS IN PRISON.

02:55.775 --> 02:56.843
>> THAT IS ABSOLUTELY

02:56.910 --> 02:57.210
APPALLING.

02:57.277 --> 02:58.044
AND LOOK, THERE ARE LOTS OF

02:58.111 --> 02:59.479
UNDERSTANDABLE REASONS SOMEONE

02:59.546 --> 03:00.079
IN ALABAMA MIGHT BE CRIMINALLY

03:00.146 --> 03:00.947
PUNISHED.

03:01.014 --> 03:02.382
FOR MURDER, SAY, OR FOR RUNNING

03:02.448 --> 03:03.950
A PONZI SCHEME OR FOR CREATING

03:04.017 --> 03:08.421
THIS ACTUAL STATUE AT AN ALABAMA

03:08.488 --> 03:10.456
McDONALD'S OF RONALD McDONALD

03:10.523 --> 03:11.758
REIMAGINED AS A GIANT

03:11.824 --> 03:12.191
BOLL WEEVIL.

03:12.258 --> 03:12.959
BUT NO ONE SHOULD EVER BE

03:13.026 --> 03:13.560
FACING CRIMINAL PUNISHMENT FOR

03:13.626 --> 03:14.160
PROVIDING HEALTHCARE TO YOUNG

03:14.227 --> 03:15.094
PEOPLE.

03:15.161 --> 03:16.596
THIS LAW WAS SIGNED BY THE

03:16.663 --> 03:17.263
STATE'S GOVERNOR, KAY IVEY,

03:17.330 --> 03:19.299
A WOMAN WHO, AS YOU CAN SEE,

03:19.365 --> 03:20.300
ALWAYS LOOKS LIKE SHE'S SAYING

03:20.366 --> 03:21.501
"HAM."

03:21.568 --> 03:23.336
HERE SHE IS AGAIN, SAYING

03:23.403 --> 03:24.737
"HAM," AND HERE SHE IS,

03:24.804 --> 03:25.705
MIXING IT UP AND SAYING

03:25.772 --> 03:30.009
"HAM, Y'ALL."

03:30.076 --> 03:37.784
IVEY WAS DEEPLY COMMITTED TO

03:37.850 --> 03:39.519
THESE ANTI TRANS LEGISLATION.

03:39.586 --> 03:39.886
EVEN MAKING THEM

03:39.953 --> 03:40.453
A FEATURE OF HER REELECTION

03:40.520 --> 03:40.987
CAMPAIGN.

03:41.054 --> 03:41.988
>> SOME THINGS ARE JUST FACTS.

03:42.055 --> 03:42.822
SUMMER'S HOT, THE OCEAN'S BIG,

03:42.889 --> 03:43.389
AND GENDER IS A QUESTION OF

03:43.456 --> 03:44.591
BIOLOGY, NOT IDENTITY.

03:44.657 --> 03:47.026
HERE IN ALABAMA, WE'RE GONNA GO

03:47.093 --> 03:48.962
BY HOW GOD MADE US BECAUSE WE

03:49.028 --> 03:50.263
IDENTIFY WITH SOMETHING LIBERALS

03:50.330 --> 03:54.067
REALITY.

03:54.133 --> 03:55.034
>> OKAY, FIRST, FUCK YOU.

03:55.101 --> 03:57.170
SECOND, "SUMMER'S HOT, OCEAN'S

03:57.236 --> 03:58.538
BIG" DOESN'T SOUND LIKE

03:58.605 --> 03:59.539
THE WIND UP TO DENYING TRANS

03:59.606 --> 04:00.540
PEOPLE THEIR RIGHTS.

04:00.607 --> 04:01.975
IT SOUNDS LIKE A CHILDREN'S BOOK

04:02.041 --> 04:03.810
THE AUTHOR WROTE WHILE HUNGOVER.

04:03.876 --> 04:04.410
"SUMMER'S HOT.

04:04.477 --> 04:05.411
OCEAN'S BIG.

04:05.478 --> 04:06.412
I DON'T KNOW, WHAT MORE DO YOU

04:06.479 --> 04:08.514
FUCKING KIDS WANT FROM ME?"

04:08.581 --> 04:10.083
AS FOR HER POINT THAT WE HAVE

04:10.149 --> 04:11.351
TO RESPECT "HOW GOD MADE US,"

04:11.417 --> 04:13.853
DO WE?

04:13.920 --> 04:14.621
REALLY?

04:14.687 --> 04:15.922
WHY?

04:15.989 --> 04:17.023
'CAUSE WE'VE GOT TOO MANY HOLES,

04:17.090 --> 04:17.690
WAY TOO LITTLE HAIR,

04:17.757 --> 04:18.891
AND NECKS --

04:18.958 --> 04:20.259
FRAGILE LOLLIPOP BONES THAT

04:20.326 --> 04:21.828
BALANCE OUR DUM-DUM HEADS IN ONE

04:21.894 --> 04:24.230
VERY SPECIFIC DIRECTION OR ELSE

04:24.297 --> 04:24.597
WE DIE.

04:24.664 --> 04:24.964
NONE OF THIS IS

04:25.031 --> 04:27.500
INTELLIGENT DESIGN.

04:27.567 --> 04:28.768
AND WHILE ALABAMA'S WORST

04:28.835 --> 04:32.538
MEE-MAW MIGHT APPEAL TO

04:32.605 --> 04:34.073
"REALITY," THE TRUTH IS, THE

04:34.140 --> 04:35.408
MAJOR MEDICAL ASSOCIATIONS

04:35.475 --> 04:36.509
OPPOSE BANS ON GENDER-AFFIRMING

04:36.576 --> 04:37.577
CARE, AND WITH GOOD REASON --

04:37.644 --> 04:39.879
BECAUSE IT SAVES LIVES, AND

04:39.946 --> 04:41.881
WITHDRAWING IT CAN BE INCREDIBLY

04:41.948 --> 04:43.216
HARMFUL, AS THIS 15-YEAR-OLD

04:43.282 --> 04:44.217
GIRL NAMED HARLEIGH

04:44.283 --> 04:45.151
WILL TELL YOU.

04:45.218 --> 04:46.486
>> IF I DID STOP MY

04:46.552 --> 04:50.156
GENDER-AFFIRMING CARE,

04:50.223 --> 04:51.557
MY PHYSICAL OUTSIDE WOULDN'T

04:51.624 --> 04:53.493
REFLECT ON WHO I WAS INSIDE.

04:53.559 --> 04:55.628
AND THAT WOULD, LIKE, COMPLETELY

04:55.695 --> 04:57.363
DESTROY ME MENTALLY AND

04:57.430 --> 05:01.100
PHYSICALLY.

05:01.167 --> 05:05.938
>> OKAY, FIRST OFF,

05:06.005 --> 05:07.573
HARLEIGH, YOU SEEM GREAT.

05:07.640 --> 05:08.775
YOU'RE LIVING AS YOUR FULL,

05:08.841 --> 05:10.043
AUTHENTIC SELF,

05:10.109 --> 05:10.943
AS FOR GOVERNOR IVEY,

05:11.010 --> 05:12.145
IF YOU CAN LOOK AT HARLEIGH

05:12.211 --> 05:13.446
OR ANY CHILD AND COMFORTABLY

05:13.513 --> 05:15.048
SAY, "TAKE AWAY THE CARE THAT

05:15.114 --> 05:15.782
GIVES THEM PEACE AND A SENSE OF

05:15.848 --> 05:18.251
SELF," YOU ARE A BAD PERSON.

05:18.317 --> 05:19.686
IN FACT, THE ONLY GOOD THING YOU

05:19.752 --> 05:21.521
COULD POSSIBLY BRING INTO THIS

05:21.587 --> 05:22.522
WORLD IS IF YOU WERE PLAYED BY

05:22.588 --> 05:23.856
BELOVED CHARACTER ACTRESS MARGO

05:23.923 --> 05:25.758
MARTINDALE IN A LIMITED SERIES.

05:25.825 --> 05:26.626
IT WOULDN'T BE EASY FOR MARGO,

05:26.693 --> 05:27.994
BECAUSE SHE'S SO UNIVERSALLY

05:28.061 --> 05:29.395
BELOVED, AND YOU'RE AN ABSOLUTE

05:29.462 --> 05:30.763
GARBAGE LADY, BUT IT WOULD BE

05:30.830 --> 05:34.667
UNMISSABLE TV.

05:34.734 --> 05:35.501
NOW THE RHETORIC AROUND THESE

05:35.568 --> 05:37.170
BILLS IS THAT THEY'RE DESIGNED

05:37.236 --> 05:38.271
TO PREVENT -- AND I AM USING THE

05:38.337 --> 05:38.871
BIGGEST AIR QUOTES IMAGINABLE

05:38.938 --> 05:40.273
HERE -- "IRREVERSIBLE HARM."

05:40.339 --> 05:42.141
AND ITS SUPPORTERS --

05:42.208 --> 05:42.675
AND ITS SUPPORTERS --

05:42.742 --> 05:43.609
LIKE MANY TRANSPHOBES --

05:43.676 --> 05:44.444
TEND TO FIXATE ON THE SURGERY

05:44.510 --> 05:47.146
PART OF TRANSITIONING,

05:47.213 --> 05:47.914
EVEN THOUGH, FOR THE RECORD

05:47.980 --> 05:49.582
TRANSITIONING IS FAR

05:49.649 --> 05:50.116
MORE EXPANSIVE THAN THAT,

05:50.183 --> 05:51.250
MAY NOT ENTAIL SURGERY, AND, AS

05:51.317 --> 05:52.018
WE'VE SAID BEFORE, WHEN IT DOES,

05:52.085 --> 05:52.919
IS NONE OF YOUR FUCKING

05:52.985 --> 05:59.959
BUSINESS.

06:00.026 --> 06:01.594
BUT WHEN IT COMES TO THE

06:01.661 --> 06:02.228
CHILDREN OF ALABAMA, AS A DOCTOR

06:02.295 --> 06:02.795
TOLD THEIR STATE LEGISLATURE

06:02.862 --> 06:03.396
JUST LAST YEAR, IT'S NOT EVEN

06:03.463 --> 06:03.996
A FACTOR.

06:04.063 --> 06:06.599
>> HERE'S WHAT WE DO

06:06.666 --> 06:07.934
AND WHAT WE DON'T.

06:08.000 --> 06:09.769
GENITAL SURGERY IS NEVER

06:09.836 --> 06:12.238
PERFORMED ON MINORS IN ALABAMA.

06:12.305 --> 06:13.806
PUBERTY BLOCKING MEDICATIONS

06:13.873 --> 06:16.676
ARE 100% REVERSIBLE AND CAN BE

06:16.743 --> 06:17.777
LIFESAVING.

06:17.844 --> 06:20.246
NOW, SOME OLDER TEENS,

06:20.313 --> 06:21.481
NOT SEVEN-YEAR-OLDS,

06:21.547 --> 06:23.382
MERIT HORMONAL THERAPY.

06:23.449 --> 06:25.184
BUT INITIATION INVOLVES LENGTHY

06:25.251 --> 06:27.820
INFORMED CONSENT, LENGTHY MENTAL

06:27.887 --> 06:29.689
HEALTH OVERSIGHT, AND THE

06:29.756 --> 06:31.691
SUB-SPECIALIZED CARE PROVIDED.

06:31.758 --> 06:32.692
>> YEAH, OF COURSE DOCTORS

06:32.759 --> 06:33.426
ARE GOING TO BE THOUGHTFUL AND

06:33.493 --> 06:34.026
RIGOROUS WHEN CARING FOR THEIR

06:34.093 --> 06:38.464
PATIENTS.

06:38.531 --> 06:39.365
BECAUSE, UNLIKE THE ALABAMA

06:39.432 --> 06:40.166
LEGISLATURE, THEY ACTUALLY CARE

06:40.233 --> 06:42.468
ABOUT KIDS' WELL-BEING.

06:42.535 --> 06:43.069
BUT YOU CAN SEE WHY LAWMAKERS

06:43.136 --> 06:43.636
DON'T TELL THE WHOLE PICTURE

06:43.703 --> 06:44.237
WHEN IT COMES TO GENDER

06:44.303 --> 06:46.205
AFFIRMING CARE.

06:46.272 --> 06:46.906
BECAUSE A LAWN SIGN SAYING,

06:46.973 --> 06:48.341
"BAN LENGTHY INFORMED CONSENT,

06:48.407 --> 06:50.009
LENGTHY MENTAL HEALTH OVERSIGHT,

06:50.076 --> 06:50.543
AND SUB-SPECIALIZED CARE"

06:50.610 --> 06:51.544
DOESN'T QUITE HAVE THE SAME

06:51.611 --> 06:52.945
PUNCH TO IT, DOES IT?

06:53.012 --> 06:54.313
NOW, THE GOOD NEWS IS,

06:54.380 --> 06:56.315
ON FRIDAY, A FEDERAL JUDGE

06:56.382 --> 06:57.316
ISSUED A PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION

06:57.383 --> 06:58.551
ON ALABAMA'S BAN, MEANING THAT

06:58.618 --> 07:00.586
THE STATE IS BARRED FOR NOW

07:00.653 --> 07:01.220
FROM ENFORCING PART

07:01.287 --> 07:02.889
OF ITS LAW, SPECIFICALLY

07:02.955 --> 07:03.289
THE BAN ON ACCESS

07:03.356 --> 07:05.057
TO MEDICATION.

07:05.124 --> 07:07.026
BUT IT'S ALREADY WORKING ON

07:07.093 --> 07:07.994
FILING AN APPEAL, AND THE REST

07:08.060 --> 07:10.096
OF THE LAW REMAINS IN PLACE.

07:10.163 --> 07:12.532
AND YOU CAN'T HELP THINKING THAT

07:12.598 --> 07:13.032
THIS WHOLE THING IS JUST

07:13.099 --> 07:14.667
RIGHT-WING VIRTUE-SIGNALING,

07:14.734 --> 07:16.969
SENDING A HATEFUL MESSAGE

07:17.036 --> 07:18.571
TO A CONSERVATIVE BASE

07:18.638 --> 07:21.474
WITH NO THOUGHT GIVEN TO THE

07:21.541 --> 07:22.542
PAIN IT WILL CAUSE.

07:22.608 --> 07:24.010
AND NO MATTER WHAT THE EVENTUAL

07:24.076 --> 07:25.111
FATE OF THE LAW IS, ACTUAL TRANS

07:25.178 --> 07:26.345
PEOPLE AND THEIR ADVOCATES IN

07:26.412 --> 07:27.947
ALABAMA HAVE HEARD THE MESSAGE

07:28.014 --> 07:28.648
IT WAS MEANT TO SEND, LOUD AND

07:28.714 --> 07:30.216
CLEAR.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.551
>> AS HUMANS,

07:31.617 --> 07:34.086
THEY'RE AFRAID OF US.

07:34.153 --> 07:36.389
IT'S NOT REALLY FUN, BUT AS LONG

07:36.455 --> 07:38.224
AS IT'S PROTECTING THEIR IDEALS,

07:38.291 --> 07:39.559
THEY DON'T CARE.

07:39.625 --> 07:42.395
>> I'M JUST A NORMAL KID.

07:42.461 --> 07:45.431
LIKE, I WENT TO HOOVER HIGH

07:45.498 --> 07:45.865
SCHOOL AND

07:45.932 --> 07:46.833
I WAS IN ENGINEERING.

07:46.899 --> 07:47.466
I PLAYED HOCKEY, A LITTLE WEIRD

07:47.533 --> 07:47.800
FOR ALABAMA.

07:47.867 --> 07:48.401
THAT'S PROBABLY THE MOST

07:48.467 --> 07:49.735
ABNORMAL PART.

07:49.802 --> 07:50.469
LIKE, I'M TRANS, AND WHAT HARM

07:50.536 --> 07:55.641
AM I DOING?

07:55.708 --> 07:56.742
>> I WANT TO KNOW WHY YOU FEEL

07:56.809 --> 07:57.910
SO COMFORTABLE DICTATING OTHER

07:57.977 --> 07:59.178
PEOPLE'S LIVES?

07:59.245 --> 08:01.581
I JUST NEED TO KNOW, NOT

08:01.647 --> 08:03.749
RELIGION BASED, WHERE THE

08:03.816 --> 08:05.084
ENTITLEMENT COMES FROM.

08:05.151 --> 08:08.454
>> TO THOSE SENATORS AND

08:08.521 --> 08:09.088
REPRESENTATIVES WHO SUPPORT THIS

08:09.155 --> 08:09.789
BILL, THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR

08:09.856 --> 08:10.857
MAKING ALABAMA A NATIONAL

08:10.923 --> 08:19.098
EMBARRASSMENT YET AGAIN.

08:19.165 --> 08:20.199
>> YEAH, HE'S

08:20.266 --> 08:20.933
ABSOLUTELY RIGHT.

08:21.000 --> 08:21.767
AND TO TRANS CHILDREN IN ALABAMA

08:21.834 --> 08:22.368
RIGHT NOW, LET ME SAY THIS.

08:22.435 --> 08:22.602
Y'ALL --

08:22.668 --> 08:23.436
AM I SAYING THAT RIGHT?

08:23.502 --> 08:23.803
Y'ALL?

08:23.870 --> 08:26.205
I DON'T THINK I CAN CARRY THAT

08:26.272 --> 08:28.674
OFF.

08:28.741 --> 08:30.576
YOU ARE IMPORTANT.

08:30.643 --> 08:31.510
I CAN'T IMAGINE TRYING TO BUILD

08:31.577 --> 08:32.144
SELF-ESTEEM IN CHILDHOOD AS YOUR

08:32.211 --> 08:32.678
OWN GOVERNMENT ATTEMPTS TO

08:32.745 --> 08:33.679
UNDERMINE YOUR VERY EXISTENCE.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.413
BUT YOU SHOULD KNOW, YOU'RE

08:34.480 --> 08:36.983
PROFOUNDLY VALUABLE AND

08:37.049 --> 08:38.684
YOU ARE IRREPLACEABLE.

08:38.751 --> 08:39.252
AS FOR KAY IVEY, WHAT THE FUCK

08:39.318 --> 08:40.720
IS WRONG WITH YOU?

08:40.786 --> 08:42.688
I KNOW THAT'S A SIMPLE QUESTION

08:42.755 --> 08:43.890
WITH PROBABLY A LONG,

08:43.956 --> 08:44.490
COMPLICATED ANSWER, BUT TO PUT

08:44.557 --> 08:45.124
THIS IN TERMS YOU'LL DEFINITELY

08:46.659 --> 08:48.828
SUMMER'S HOT, OCEAN'S BIG,

08:48.895 --> 08:50.263
AND THE PEOPLE OF ALABAMA

08:50.329 --> 08:50.763
DESERVE A LOT BETTER

08:50.830 --> 08:51.364
THAN YOU.

08:51.430 --> 08:58.371
AND NOW THIS.

08:58.437 --> 09:01.574
>> AND NOW THE

09:01.641 --> 09:03.442
DELIGHTFUL DELIGHT OF

09:03.509 --> 09:04.143
ALLISON HAMMOND.

09:04.210 --> 09:05.444
>> FROM THE ORIGINAL BLADE

09:05.511 --> 09:05.678
RUNNER.

09:05.745 --> 09:08.414
THIS IS WHAT THEY USED.

09:08.481 --> 09:09.715
ATTENTION TO DETAILS.

09:09.782 --> 09:12.018
FANS WILL PROBABLY LIKE THAT.

09:12.084 --> 09:15.388
>> ARE YOU A FAN OF THE

09:15.454 --> 09:15.655
ORIGINAL?

09:15.721 --> 09:17.990
>> NEVER SEEN IT.

09:18.324 --> 09:19.659
I'M GOING TO GIVE YOU A QUOTE

09:19.725 --> 09:20.226
THAT YOU HAVE TO LET ME KNOW

09:20.293 --> 09:23.629
WHETHER YOU THINK IT'S

09:23.696 --> 09:25.898
SHAKESPEARE.

09:26.432 --> 09:28.601
LOOK AT THAT.

09:28.668 --> 09:32.238
BEAUTIFUL.

09:33.639 --> 09:37.576
>> WHY CAN'T YOU JUST PICK IT

09:37.643 --> 09:37.743
UP?

09:38.077 --> 09:41.180
>> HERE ARE SOME OTHER NOTES.

09:41.247 --> 09:41.747
HERE'S ONE OF THEM.

09:41.814 --> 09:45.418
THIS IS "LOVE YOU."

09:46.619 --> 09:51.357
YOU ARE THE BADDEST WOMAN.

09:55.294 --> 09:58.698
>> YOU KNOW I DON'T DRINK.

09:59.031 --> 10:05.338
AND THERE YOU HAVE IT.

10:06.839 --> 10:07.873
>> MOVING ON.

10:07.940 --> 10:08.975
OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT CONCERNS

10:09.041 --> 10:10.076
UTILITIES -- SPECIFICALLY,

10:10.142 --> 10:11.477
ELECTRIC UTILITIES --

10:11.544 --> 10:13.145
THE COMPANIES RESPONSIBLE FOR

10:13.212 --> 10:14.180
DELIVERING US POWER, AND ALSO,

10:14.246 --> 10:16.048
GIVING US THE CREEPIEST MASCOT

10:16.115 --> 10:18.718
REDDY KILOWATT,

10:18.784 --> 10:20.019
A HELL-CREATURE WHO FOR DECADES,

10:20.086 --> 10:21.454
APPEARED IN ADS FOR OVER TWO

10:21.520 --> 10:22.822
HUNDRED ELECTRIC COMPANIES, LIKE

10:22.888 --> 10:25.224
THIS ONE ABOUT HIM EMANCIPATING

10:25.291 --> 10:27.193
WOMAN IN THE HOME AND THIS ONE,

10:27.259 --> 10:28.661
WHERE HE TELLS A HOUSEWIFE,

10:28.728 --> 10:29.762
"DON'T KILL YOURSELF,

10:29.829 --> 10:31.797
IT AIN'T WORTH IT."

10:31.864 --> 10:32.898
REDDY EVEN APPEARED ON

10:32.965 --> 10:33.899
CHILDREN'S SHOWS, WHERE HE

10:33.966 --> 10:35.134
UNDOUBTEDLY GAVE A WHOLE

10:35.201 --> 10:37.269
GENERATION NIGHTMARES.

10:37.336 --> 10:38.704
>> WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?

10:38.771 --> 10:40.139
>> HA, HA.

10:40.206 --> 10:41.407
YOU SHOULD KNOW THAT YOU CAN

10:41.474 --> 10:42.808
EXPECT ANYTHING TO HAPPEN HERE,

10:42.875 --> 10:43.809
MR. TOOT.

10:43.876 --> 10:45.111
>> BOY, I'LL SAY.

10:45.177 --> 10:47.013
WHOA, HEY, WHAT'S HAPPENING NOW?

10:47.079 --> 10:48.848
THOSE -- THOSE PEANUTS,

10:48.914 --> 10:50.783
THEY'RE FLOATING IN THE AIR!

10:50.850 --> 10:51.717
>> THAT'S MY NEW ELECTROSTATIC

10:51.784 --> 10:59.358
GENERATOR.

10:59.425 --> 11:00.292
>> GET OUT OF THERE!

11:00.359 --> 11:01.193
THAT'S THE ONLY TIME I'VE EVER

11:01.260 --> 11:02.028
BEEN SCARED FOR A CLOWN.

11:02.094 --> 11:02.862
WE CAN'T ACTUALLY SHOW YOU THE

11:02.928 --> 11:03.763
REST OF THAT VIDEO, BECAUSE --

11:03.829 --> 11:04.530
AND THIS IS TRUE -- IF YOU WATCH

11:04.597 --> 11:05.164
IT TILL THE END, REDDY SHOWS UP

11:05.231 --> 11:06.332
BEHIND YOU AND BRUTALLY MURDERS

11:06.399 --> 11:08.134
YOU.

11:08.200 --> 11:08.768
NOW, YOU PROBABLY DON'T GIVE TOO

11:08.834 --> 11:09.535
MUCH THOUGHT TO YOUR LOCAL

11:09.602 --> 11:10.569
ELECTRIC UTILITY.

11:10.636 --> 11:11.637
BUT IF YOU DO, IT MIGHT BE

11:11.704 --> 11:12.972
BECAUSE THEY'RE CHARGING

11:13.039 --> 11:14.774
EXORBITANT RATES FOR A BASIC

11:14.840 --> 11:15.941
HUMAN NECESSITY, AS THIS NORTH

11:16.008 --> 11:18.511
CAROLINA PASTOR EXPLAINS.

11:18.577 --> 11:19.945
>> ONE OF THE FOUNDING MEMBERS

11:20.012 --> 11:21.147
OF THIS CHURCH, SISTER LINDA

11:21.213 --> 11:23.549
JONES, SHE LITERALLY CUT HER

11:23.616 --> 11:26.552
PILLS IN HALF, SKIPPED DAYS,

11:26.619 --> 11:29.288
IN ORDER TO PAY HER LIGHT BILL.

11:29.355 --> 11:30.856
GOD BLESS HER SOUL.

11:30.923 --> 11:32.224
SHE PASSED ON.

11:32.291 --> 11:34.160
AND THERE ARE HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE

11:34.226 --> 11:35.594
RIGHT AROUND HERE WHO NEED THAT

11:35.661 --> 11:39.498
HELP.

11:39.565 --> 11:40.866
>> THAT IS TERRIBLE.

11:40.933 --> 11:41.700
AND IN CASE IT BUMPED YOU AT

11:41.767 --> 11:43.369
ALL, YOU'RE RIGHT, THAT WAS A

11:43.436 --> 11:44.303
PROPERTY BROTHER YOU SPOTTED

11:44.370 --> 11:45.404
THERE.

11:45.471 --> 11:46.539
HE MADE A DOCUMENTARY ABOUT

11:46.605 --> 11:48.074
UTILITIES AND IT'S ACTUALLY

11:48.140 --> 11:49.275
PRETTY GOOD, TO THE POINT YOU'RE

11:49.341 --> 11:49.909
EVEN GOING TO SEE A LITTLE MORE

11:49.975 --> 11:50.843
OF IT LATER ON.

11:50.910 --> 11:57.183
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING WHICH

11:57.249 --> 11:58.084
PROPERTY BROTHER THAT IS, I'LL

11:58.150 --> 11:59.251
GIVE YOU A CLUE.

11:59.318 --> 12:00.653
IT'S THE CIRCUMCISED ONE.

12:00.719 --> 12:01.220
AND IF YOU DON'T KNOW WHICH

12:01.287 --> 12:02.154
PROPERTY BROTHER IS CIRCUMCISED,

12:02.221 --> 12:02.755
YOU'RE CLEARLY NOT THAT BIG A

12:02.822 --> 12:03.556
FAN OF THE "PROPERTY BROTHERS."

12:03.622 --> 12:04.290
AND HIGH BILLS ARE JUST THE

12:04.356 --> 12:05.324
BEGINNING OF THE PROBLEMS HERE.

12:05.391 --> 12:06.759
BECAUSE UTILITIES ARE ALSO

12:06.826 --> 12:08.561
EXCEPTIONALLY PRONE TO SCANDAL.

12:08.627 --> 12:10.496
IN FACT, JUST GOOGLE YOUR

12:10.563 --> 12:11.597
UTILITY COMPANY RIGHT NOW AND

12:11.664 --> 12:13.232
THE WORD "SCANDAL," AND CHANCES

12:13.299 --> 12:14.366
ARE, THEY'VE GOTTEN INTO SOME

12:14.433 --> 12:15.701
MAJOR TROUBLE.

12:15.768 --> 12:17.036
IT'S BASICALLY LIKE GOOGLING

12:17.103 --> 12:19.071
YOUR LOCAL JIMMY JOHNS

12:19.138 --> 12:20.606
AND "E. COLI" OR THE NAME OF

12:20.673 --> 12:22.942
YOUR FAVORITE TEACHER FROM HIGH

12:23.008 --> 12:24.276
SCHOOL AND "JANUARY 6TH."

12:24.343 --> 12:26.612
YOU'RE NOT GOING TO LIKE

12:26.679 --> 12:27.680
THE RESULTS THAT YOU FIND.

12:27.746 --> 12:28.514
AND AT THEIR WORST, UTILITIES

12:28.581 --> 12:29.515
CAN EVEN BE DEADLY.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.050
TAKE PACIFIC GAS AND ELECTRIC,

12:31.117 --> 12:32.351
ONE OF CALIFORNIA'S LARGEST

12:32.418 --> 12:36.555
UTILITIES.

12:36.622 --> 12:40.693
WE'VE TALKED BEFORE ABOUT THE

12:40.759 --> 12:42.161
2018 CAMP FIRE, THE DEADLIEST

12:42.228 --> 12:43.062
WILDFIRE IN CALIFORNIA HISTORY,

12:43.129 --> 12:44.263
AND HOW IT ALL STARTED WHEN THIS

12:44.330 --> 12:44.730
HOOK HOLDING UP A PG&E

12:44.797 --> 12:45.397
TRANSMISSION LINE BROKE, CAUSING

12:45.464 --> 12:46.465
THE LINE TO IGNITE THE BRUSH

12:46.532 --> 12:47.700
BELOW, EVENTUALLY DECIMATING

12:47.766 --> 12:51.570
SEVERAL NEARBY COMMUNITIES AND

12:51.637 --> 12:52.338
LEAVING 85 PEOPLE DEAD.

12:52.404 --> 12:53.339
PG&E HAS SINCE PAID FINES AND

12:53.405 --> 12:54.006
SETTLEMENTS, BUT IT'S STILL VERY

12:54.073 --> 12:55.941
MUCH IN OPERATION.

12:56.008 --> 12:57.276
DESPITE THE FACT THAT WASN'T

12:57.343 --> 12:58.911
CLOSE TO THE ONLY SCANDAL

12:58.978 --> 13:00.279
THEY'VE BEEN INVOLVED IN, AS

13:00.346 --> 13:01.914
THIS REPORTER WILL TELL YOU.

13:01.981 --> 13:03.649
>> THIS IS A COMPANY THAT, IT

13:03.716 --> 13:05.417
WAS FINED HUNDREDS OF TIMES AND

13:05.484 --> 13:06.952
FACED MORE THAN $2 BILLION --

13:07.019 --> 13:08.087
ALMOST $3 BILLION WORTH

13:08.154 --> 13:09.555
OF FINES.

13:09.622 --> 13:10.189
YOU KNOW, IF PG&E WAS AN

13:10.256 --> 13:11.690
INDIVIDUAL AND NOT A

13:11.757 --> 13:13.192
CORPORATION, I THINK BY NOW THEY

13:13.259 --> 13:17.830
WOULD BE IN PRISON.

13:17.897 --> 13:18.531
THERE'S JUST BEEN REPEAT

13:18.597 --> 13:19.298
OFFENDERS.

13:19.365 --> 13:20.232
THEY'VE BEEN ON PROBATION.

13:20.299 --> 13:20.799
THEY'VE VIOLATED

13:20.866 --> 13:21.634
PROBATION.

13:21.700 --> 13:22.501
THE PROBLEM IS YOU CAN'T TAKE

13:22.568 --> 13:23.102
A CORPORATION AND PUT IT INTO

13:23.169 --> 13:24.470
PRISON.

13:24.537 --> 13:25.104
>> YEAH, HE'S RIGHT!

13:25.171 --> 13:26.705
YOU CAN'T.

13:26.772 --> 13:29.175
EVEN THOUGH MANY CORPORATIONS

13:29.241 --> 13:30.576
CLEARLY DESERVE TO BE IN PRISON,

13:30.643 --> 13:32.411
FROM ENRON TO PURDUE TO ANY

13:32.478 --> 13:33.078
COMPANY THAT INSISTS ON TALKING

13:33.145 --> 13:33.846
LIKE A SASSY BITCH ON SOCIAL

13:33.913 --> 13:37.483
MEDIA.

13:37.550 --> 13:40.553
HELLMANN'S ONCE TWEETED,

13:40.619 --> 13:41.020
"YOU'RE IN THEIR DMs,

13:41.086 --> 13:41.720
WE'RE GETTING SPREAD

13:41.787 --> 13:42.087
ON THEIR BREAD?"

13:42.154 --> 13:42.321
AND WHY?

13:42.388 --> 13:43.255
YOU DON'T NEED TO DO THIS,

13:43.322 --> 13:43.923
HELLMANN'S.

13:43.989 --> 13:46.892
YOU CAN JUST BE MAYONNAISE.

13:46.959 --> 13:49.995
BUT PG&E IS NOT ONLY NOT IN

13:50.062 --> 13:50.596
PRISON; IT IS STILL SUPPLYING

13:50.663 --> 13:51.230
POWER TO MILLIONS OF

13:51.297 --> 13:51.864
CALIFORNIANS WHO HAVE NO CHOICE

13:51.931 --> 13:53.132
IN THE MATTER.

13:53.199 --> 13:54.600
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING

13:54.667 --> 13:56.502
"HOW THE FUCK IS THAT POSSIBLE?"

13:56.569 --> 13:57.102
THAT IS WHAT THIS STORY

13:57.169 --> 13:58.237
IS ABOUT.

13:58.304 --> 13:59.905
IT'S ABOUT THE INCREDIBLE AMOUNT

13:59.972 --> 14:02.274
OF POWER WE GIVE TO UTILITIES,

14:02.341 --> 14:03.175
HOW WEAKLY THEY CAN BE

14:03.242 --> 14:03.709
REGULATED, AND THE DAMAGE

14:03.776 --> 14:06.645
THEY CAN DO.

14:06.712 --> 14:07.646
AND LET'S START WITH THE SINGLE

14:07.713 --> 14:08.380
MOST IMPORTANT THING TO KNOW

14:08.447 --> 14:09.615
ABOUT UTILITY COMPANIES, WHICH

14:09.682 --> 14:10.849
IS THAT FOR MOST OF US, THEY'RE

14:10.916 --> 14:13.352
ACTUALLY THE ONLY GAME IN TOWN.

14:13.419 --> 14:16.021
>> IF YOU WANT TO GO BUY AN

14:16.088 --> 14:17.122
iPHONE OR ANY OTHER KIND OF

14:17.189 --> 14:18.257
CONSUMER PRODUCT, YOU GO OUT TO

14:18.324 --> 14:20.526
A STORE AND YOU HAVE A NUMBER OF

14:20.593 --> 14:21.193
CHOICES.

14:21.260 --> 14:22.728
WITH ELECTRICITY, IN MOST OF THE

14:22.795 --> 14:24.129
COUNTRY, YOU REALLY ONLY HAVE

14:24.196 --> 14:25.264
ONE CHOICE, AND THAT COMPANY HAS

14:25.331 --> 14:28.534
A MONOPOLY.

14:28.601 --> 14:29.368
>> EXACTLY.

14:29.435 --> 14:30.736
IN OUR MODERN ECONOMY, YOU'RE

14:30.803 --> 14:31.604
SUPPOSED TO HAVE CHOICE.

14:31.670 --> 14:32.738
JUST LOOK AT ALL THE STREAMING

14:32.805 --> 14:34.473
SERVICES OUT THERE.

14:34.540 --> 14:37.076
THERE'S BLOCKBUSTER 2.0,

14:37.142 --> 14:38.611
SUPERHEROES AND OLD RACISM,

14:38.677 --> 14:39.945
ANIME, PROBABLY CRASHING ON YOU

14:40.012 --> 14:41.447
RIGHT NOW, NO IDEA, NO IDEA, AND

14:41.513 --> 14:45.150
UNTIL RECENTLY, NEWS QUIBI.

14:45.217 --> 14:47.086
THAT'S ARGUABLY TOO MUCH CHOICE.

14:47.152 --> 14:48.554
BUT UTILITIES OPERATING AS

14:48.621 --> 14:49.955
NATURAL MONOPOLIES DATES BACK

14:50.022 --> 14:50.756
TO THE FACT THAT, AROUND THE

14:50.823 --> 14:52.391
START OF THE 20TH CENTURY,

14:52.458 --> 14:53.525
WE NEEDED TO BUILD A NATIONWIDE

14:53.592 --> 14:55.094
POWER GRID FROM SCRATCH, AND

14:55.160 --> 14:56.595
THAT OBVIOUSLY REQUIRED A HUGE

14:56.662 --> 14:58.731
INVESTMENT.

14:58.797 --> 15:00.599
COMPANIES WERE ONLY INCENTIVIZED

15:00.666 --> 15:01.333
TO DO THAT WITH A GUARANTEE THAT

15:01.400 --> 15:02.434
THEY'D BE ABLE TO OPERATE IN A

15:02.501 --> 15:03.769
NONCOMPETITIVE ENVIRONMENT.

15:03.836 --> 15:04.270
AND AT THE TIME,

15:04.336 --> 15:06.372
THAT MADE SENSE.

15:06.438 --> 15:07.373
BUT THOSE MONOPOLIES PERSIST

15:07.439 --> 15:12.378
TO THIS DAY.

15:12.444 --> 15:16.148
MOSTLY AS FOR PROFIT

15:16.215 --> 15:17.783
INVESTOR OWNED COMPANIES.L

15:17.850 --> 15:18.350
NOW, IN EXCHANGE FOR GIVING

15:18.417 --> 15:19.518
UTILITIES A DEAL THAT SWEET,

15:19.585 --> 15:20.085
WE DID PUT SOME RESTRICTIONS

15:20.152 --> 15:20.352
IN PLACE.

15:20.419 --> 15:20.953
THE LAW SAYS THEY SHOULD SPEND

15:21.020 --> 15:21.553
THE LEAST THEY CAN WHILE

15:21.620 --> 15:22.021
PROVIDING QUALITY,

15:22.087 --> 15:25.391
ENVIRONMENTALLY SAFE SERVICE.

15:25.457 --> 15:26.358
WHICH SOUNDS GREAT.

15:26.425 --> 15:27.559
BECAUSE IT CAPS THEIR ABILITY TO

15:27.626 --> 15:28.027
MAKE TOO MUCH MONEY.

15:28.093 --> 15:31.297
BUT -- AND THIS IS

15:31.363 --> 15:32.698
A HUGE "BUT" --

15:32.765 --> 15:33.465
THERE'S A CARVEOUT.

15:33.532 --> 15:34.833
BECAUSE WHEN THEY BUILD

15:34.900 --> 15:36.869
SOMETHING, A PIECE OF PHYSICAL

15:36.935 --> 15:37.736
INFRASTRUCTURE, THEY'RE

15:37.803 --> 15:40.005
ALLOWED TO THEN PASS ALONG THAT

15:40.072 --> 15:41.140
COST TO YOU THROUGH YOUR BILL,

15:41.206 --> 15:41.940
PLUS AN ADDITIONAL PERCENTAGE

15:42.007 --> 15:43.042
THEY GET TO KEEP AS PROFIT,

15:43.108 --> 15:44.843
USUALLY AROUND TEN PERCENT.

15:44.910 --> 15:45.344
AND THIS CREATES A CLEAR

15:45.411 --> 15:46.612
INCENTIVE.

15:46.679 --> 15:48.714
THE BIGGER THE PROJECT,

15:48.781 --> 15:51.183
LIKE A POWER PLANT,

15:51.250 --> 15:51.950
THE MORE PROFIT THEY MAKE,

15:52.017 --> 15:53.052
AS THIS ACTIVIST EXPLAINS.

15:53.118 --> 15:55.220
>> BIG MONOPOLY UTILITIES GET

15:55.287 --> 15:56.588
A GUARANTEED RANGE OF A RATE OF

15:56.655 --> 15:57.289
RETURN ON THEIR CAPITAL

15:57.356 --> 15:58.657
EXPENDITURES.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.292
SO, LIKE A WAITER

16:00.359 --> 16:02.628
IN A RESTAURANT WHERE THERE'S

16:02.695 --> 16:04.029
A GUARANTEED TIP, THE MORE THAT

16:04.096 --> 16:06.098
IS SPENT, IF YOU BUY DESSERT

16:06.165 --> 16:07.700
OR YOU GET A BOTTLE OF WINE,

16:07.766 --> 16:08.634
THE MORE MONEY

16:08.701 --> 16:10.269
THEY'RE GOING TO MAKE.

16:10.336 --> 16:13.939
>> RIGHT.

16:14.006 --> 16:15.240
IF YOUR PROFIT IS PEGGED TO

16:15.307 --> 16:16.241
DOING CERTAIN THINGS, YOU'RE

16:16.308 --> 16:16.975
GOING TO MAKE SURE YOU DO THOSE

16:17.042 --> 16:17.776
THINGS MORE.

16:17.843 --> 16:19.044
JUST LIKE IF HBO ONLY PAID ME

16:19.111 --> 16:19.912
FOR EVERY TIME I GOT WEIRDLY

16:19.978 --> 16:21.547
HORNY FOR AN ANIMAL...

16:21.613 --> 16:22.881
EXCEPT THAT'S ACTUALLY A BAD

16:22.948 --> 16:26.118
EXAMPLE, BECAUSE THE SHOW WOULD

16:26.185 --> 16:27.553
PRETTY MUCH LOOK EXACTLY LIKE IT

16:27.619 --> 16:27.886
ALREADY DOES.

16:27.953 --> 16:28.854
NOT NOW!

16:28.921 --> 16:29.455
NOT NOW!

16:29.521 --> 16:30.389
I'M TRYING TO MAKE A POINT.

16:30.456 --> 16:32.891
GO AWAY BEFORE I CHANGE MY MIND.

16:32.958 --> 16:34.960
GOODNESS GRACIOUS.

16:35.027 --> 16:37.696
AND IN THE BEST CASE SCENARIO,

16:37.763 --> 16:38.364
THIS MIGHT MEAN UTILITIES ARE

16:38.430 --> 16:40.666
INVESTING IN INFRASTRUCTURE

16:40.733 --> 16:42.534
THAT IS BADLY NEEDED.

16:42.601 --> 16:43.202
THE PROBLEM IS, THEY CAN ALSO BE

16:43.268 --> 16:44.403
SHAMELESS IN INCREASING

16:44.470 --> 16:45.738
SPENDING, EVEN WHEN IT'S NOT

16:45.804 --> 16:46.705
NEEDED OR ON PROJECTS THAT ARE

16:46.772 --> 16:48.307
ACTIVELY FALLING APART.

16:48.374 --> 16:50.008
TAKE SOUTH CAROLINA.

16:50.075 --> 16:51.744
WHEN UTILITIES THERE TRIED TO

16:51.810 --> 16:52.411
ADD TWO NUCLEAR REACTORS TO AN

16:52.478 --> 16:54.113
EXISTING PLANT, THE PROJECT'S

16:54.179 --> 16:55.514
COST SPIRALED.

16:55.581 --> 16:56.415
AND A MASSIVE FEDERAL

16:56.482 --> 16:57.316
INVESTIGATION LATER REVEALED

16:57.383 --> 16:58.617
THAT EXECUTIVES AT SOUTH

16:58.684 --> 17:00.953
CAROLINA ELECTRIC AND GAS AND

17:01.019 --> 17:02.588
ITS PARENT COMPANY KNEW THE

17:02.654 --> 17:03.856
PROJECT WAS FACING MAJOR DELAYS

17:03.922 --> 17:05.824
AND COST OVERRUNS, BUT WITHHELD

17:05.891 --> 17:08.460
THAT INFORMATION IN ORDER TO

17:08.527 --> 17:09.561
KEEP IT GOING.

17:09.628 --> 17:10.763
MEANWHILE, LOCAL CUSTOMERS PAID

17:10.829 --> 17:12.731
MORE THAN $2 BILLION IN

17:12.798 --> 17:13.532
THE FORM OF HIGHER BILLS FOR A

17:13.599 --> 17:14.967
PROJECT WHICH, BY THE WAY,

17:15.033 --> 17:19.338
NEVER GENERATED ANY POWER.

17:19.405 --> 17:20.672
AND SOME WORKING ON THE PROJECT

17:20.739 --> 17:21.273
AT THE TIME WERE TROUBLED BY

17:21.340 --> 17:21.940
WHAT THEY WERE SEEING.

17:22.007 --> 17:23.142
JUST LISTEN TO A LEAKED

17:23.208 --> 17:25.043
VOICEMAIL FROM A VICE-PRESIDENT

17:25.110 --> 17:26.278
AT THE PARENT COMPANY WHO LATER

17:26.345 --> 17:27.780
BECAME A WHISTLEBLOWER IN WHICH

17:27.846 --> 17:28.547
SHE TRIED TO WARN HER COLLEAGUES

17:28.614 --> 17:30.516
ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING.

17:30.582 --> 17:31.450
>> THEY ARE MISMANAGING THAT

17:31.517 --> 17:33.218
PROJECT.

17:33.285 --> 17:34.953
AND IT'S AT Y'ALL'S EXPENSE.

17:35.020 --> 17:36.822
THEY'RE DOING IT BECAUSE THEY

17:36.889 --> 17:39.792
WANT TO MAKE MONEY AND THEY'RE

17:39.858 --> 17:41.393
PROPPING UP EARNINGS TO BE ABLE

17:41.460 --> 17:42.661
TO MAKE THEIR BONUSES, AND IT'S

17:42.728 --> 17:44.496
GOING TO BE AT YOUR EXPENSE.

17:44.563 --> 17:45.063
>> YEAH, THAT'S PRETTY

17:45.130 --> 17:46.899
SHOCKING.

17:46.965 --> 17:48.600
NOT JUST WHAT SHE'S SAYING, BUT

17:48.667 --> 17:49.201
ALSO THAT PEOPLE STILL LEAVE

17:49.268 --> 17:53.205
VOICEMAILS.

17:53.272 --> 17:56.875
ABSOLUTELY NO ONE SHOULD

17:56.942 --> 17:58.177
BE DOING THAT ANYMORE.

17:58.243 --> 17:58.677
IN FACT, EVERY VOICEMAIL

17:58.744 --> 17:59.711
GREETING SHOULD JUST BE,

17:59.778 --> 18:00.245
"SORRY I MISSED YOUR CALL.

18:00.312 --> 18:00.813
PLEASE DON'T LEAVE A MESSAGE

18:00.879 --> 18:01.280
AFTER THE TONE.

18:01.346 --> 18:02.147
JUST TEXT ME INSTEAD

18:02.214 --> 18:04.383
BECAUSE IT'S NOT 1997."

18:04.450 --> 18:06.251
AND OVERSPENDING ISN'T THE ONLY

18:06.318 --> 18:08.120
WAY UTILITIES' INCENTIVES CAN

18:08.187 --> 18:09.421
WIND UP SCREWING OVER CUSTOMERS.

18:09.488 --> 18:10.489
BECAUSE THEY CAN DELIBERATELY

18:10.556 --> 18:12.858
STIFLE INNOVATION THAT MIGHT

18:12.925 --> 18:14.493
MAKE POWER CHEAPER OR BE A NET

18:14.560 --> 18:15.227
BENEFIT TO SOCIETY, AS THIS

18:15.294 --> 18:16.295
SOLAR POWER EXECUTIVE WILL TELL

18:16.361 --> 18:16.962
YOU.

18:17.029 --> 18:19.164
>> NOW SOLAR IS BECOMING REAL.

18:19.231 --> 18:20.599
THE UTILITY MONOPOLIES ARE

18:20.666 --> 18:21.600
SAYING, "WELL, WAIT A MINUTE,

18:21.667 --> 18:22.568
WE'VE GOT TO CRUSH IT

18:22.634 --> 18:25.904
BEFORE IT GETS TOO BIG."

18:25.971 --> 18:26.672
THEY WANT TO BUILD MORE PLANTS

18:26.738 --> 18:27.673
SO THEY CAN MAKE MORE MONEY, AND

18:27.739 --> 18:29.842
IF WE TAKE A LITTLE BITE OUT OF

18:29.908 --> 18:31.210
THAT APPLE AND WE SAY, "HEY,

18:31.276 --> 18:32.344
GUYS, WE'VE GOT SOLAR PANELS

18:32.411 --> 18:32.978
EVERYWHERE ON ALL THESE HOMES,

18:33.045 --> 18:33.912
YOU DON'T NEED TO BUILD THAT

18:33.979 --> 18:36.715
MANY MORE POWER PLANTS."

18:36.782 --> 18:38.350
THEN THE UTILITY GOES,

18:38.417 --> 18:38.817
"WELL, WAIT A MINUTE.

18:38.884 --> 18:39.251
HOW AM I GOING TO MAKE

18:39.318 --> 18:41.587
MORE MONEY NEXT YEAR?"

18:41.653 --> 18:42.654
>> EXACTLY.

18:42.721 --> 18:43.255
PEOPLE PUTTING UP SOLAR PANELS

18:43.322 --> 18:44.490
AND GENERATING THEIR OWN

18:44.556 --> 18:45.290
ELECTRICITY THREATENS THE

18:45.357 --> 18:47.059
ANTI-COMPETITIVE STRUCTURE OF A

18:47.125 --> 18:49.394
UTILITY'S MONOPOLY, SO THEY'RE

18:49.461 --> 18:50.596
OBVIOUSLY GOING TO TRY

18:50.662 --> 18:51.897
AND STEP IN AND BLOCK IT.

18:51.964 --> 18:53.565
WHO WANTS COMPETITION?

18:53.632 --> 18:54.566
IT JUST MAKES THINGS HARDER!

18:54.633 --> 18:55.667
YOU THINK I WANT TO COMPETE WITH

18:55.734 --> 18:57.669
"EUPHORIA" OR "LOVE ISLAND"

18:57.736 --> 18:58.904
OR THIS YOUTUBE VIDEO OF DUCKS

18:58.971 --> 19:06.311
ANNIHILATING A BOWL OF PEAS?

19:12.584 --> 19:14.286
YOU COULD BE WATCHING THAT

19:14.353 --> 19:15.554
ON A LOOP RIGHT NOW INSTEAD OF

19:15.621 --> 19:17.322
WATCHING THIS SHOW, YOU IDIOTS.

19:17.389 --> 19:21.126
WHY ARE YOU STILL HERE?

19:21.193 --> 19:22.127
MAKE BETTER CHOICES.

19:22.194 --> 19:24.029
SOME ACTIVISTS HAVE EVEN USED

19:24.096 --> 19:24.563
ROOFTOP SOLAR AS A WAY OF

19:24.630 --> 19:25.163
CHALLENGING THE MONOPOLIES IN

19:25.230 --> 19:27.499
THEIR STATES.

19:27.566 --> 19:28.033
REMEMBER THAT CHURCH FROM

19:28.100 --> 19:28.734
EARLIER, WHERE THE PASTOR WAS

19:28.800 --> 19:29.635
TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE CUTTING

19:29.701 --> 19:33.071
PILLS IN HALF TO MAKE ENDS MEET?

19:33.138 --> 19:35.474
IN 2015, TO HELP CUT COSTS,

19:35.541 --> 19:36.808
IT PARTNERED WITH THIS LOCAL

19:36.875 --> 19:37.943
NONPROFIT, AND IN AN ATTEMPT TO

19:38.010 --> 19:40.646
CHALLENGE THE LAWS ON THE BOOKS,

19:40.712 --> 19:42.548
THE NONPROFIT INSTALLED A SMALL

19:42.614 --> 19:43.715
SOLAR PANEL SYSTEM ON THE ROOF

19:43.782 --> 19:44.950
OF THE CHURCH, AT NO UPFRONT

19:45.017 --> 19:46.351
COST, FINANCING IT BY SELLING

19:46.418 --> 19:50.822
ELECTRICITY TO THEM AT ABOUT

19:50.889 --> 19:51.957
HALF THE RATE THAT THEIR

19:52.024 --> 19:52.591
UTILITY, DUKE ENERGY, CHARGED.

19:52.658 --> 19:53.992
SIMILAR ARRANGEMENTS ARE

19:54.059 --> 19:56.528
PERMITTED IN OTHER STATES, BUT

19:56.595 --> 19:57.930
NOT IN NORTH CAROLINA, AND DUKE

19:57.996 --> 20:01.533
ENERGY PUSHED BACK HARD, ASKING

20:01.600 --> 20:02.534
THE STATE'S REGULATORS TO ISSUE

20:02.601 --> 20:03.969
A CEASE AND DESIST TO THE

20:04.036 --> 20:04.603
NON-PROFIT AND INVOKE ITS POWER

20:04.670 --> 20:05.237
TO FINE THEM UP TO A THOUSAND

20:05.304 --> 20:06.905
DOLLARS A DAY FOR EVERY DAY IT

20:06.972 --> 20:08.407
SOLD POWER TO THE CHURCH.

20:08.473 --> 20:09.408
AND IN THE END, DUKE ENERGY GOT

20:09.474 --> 20:11.977
WHAT THEY WANTED.

20:12.044 --> 20:13.679
THAT CHURCH'S SOLAR ARRANGEMENT

20:13.745 --> 20:15.480
WAS SHUT DOWN, AND ANY HOPE OF

20:15.547 --> 20:16.882
REPLICATING IT IN THE STATE WAS

20:16.949 --> 20:21.386
SQUASHED.

20:21.453 --> 20:22.254
AND WHEN CIRCUMCISED

20:22.321 --> 20:23.388
PROPERTY BROTHER ASKED DUKE

20:23.455 --> 20:24.623
ABOUT THIS WHOLE SAGA, THEIR

20:24.690 --> 20:25.257
RESPONSE WASN'T GREAT.

20:25.324 --> 20:27.392
>> FAITH COMMUNITY CHURCH WANTED

20:27.459 --> 20:28.393
TO TEST REGULATION IN NORTH

20:28.460 --> 20:29.161
CAROLINA BY DOING SOMETHING THAT

20:29.227 --> 20:30.829
WAS BASICALLY ILLEGAL.

20:30.896 --> 20:31.396
>> THEY WERE TRYING TO PICK

20:31.463 --> 20:32.164
A FIGHT?

20:32.230 --> 20:33.865
>> YOU COULD SAY THAT.

20:33.932 --> 20:34.533
THEY HAD A GOOD SETUP TO GET

20:34.600 --> 20:35.867
PUBLICITY.

20:35.934 --> 20:38.570
THIS WAS AN AFRICAN AMERICAN

20:38.637 --> 20:39.438
CHURCH, AND WE'RE A BIG UTILITY

20:39.504 --> 20:40.672
AND WE'RE A TARGET, AND

20:40.739 --> 20:41.607
SOMETIMES THERE ARE GROUPS OUT

20:41.673 --> 20:43.141
THERE, THEY'RE NOT TRYING TO

20:43.208 --> 20:44.576
ADVANCE POLICY, THEY'RE TRYING

20:44.643 --> 20:45.744
TO GET MEDIA ATTENTION AND THEY

20:45.811 --> 20:48.313
DID A GOOD JOB HERE.

20:48.380 --> 20:48.914
>> ARE THERE SITUATIONS WHERE,

20:48.981 --> 20:50.582
AS A HUMAN BEING, YOU HAVE A

20:50.649 --> 20:52.250
CONFLICT AS A UTILITY COMPANY

20:52.317 --> 20:54.186
WHERE YOU'RE SAYING THIS IS HOW

20:54.252 --> 20:55.187
IT HAS TO BE, VERSUS MAYBE

20:55.253 --> 20:55.787
THERE'S A BIGGER PICTURE WITH

20:55.854 --> 20:57.389
SOMETHING THAT'S BROKEN?

20:57.456 --> 20:58.390
>> I THINK THAT'S JUST THE WAY

20:58.457 --> 21:02.027
IT HAS BEEN.

21:02.094 --> 21:04.396
>> WAIT, WAIT.

21:04.463 --> 21:05.297
"JUST THE WAY IT'S BEEN"

21:05.364 --> 21:06.198
HAS, HISTORICALLY, NEVER

21:06.264 --> 21:06.932
BEEN A GREAT JUSTIFICATION FOR

21:06.999 --> 21:07.499
SOMETHING STILL HAPPENING.

21:07.566 --> 21:09.401
IN FACT, THERE'S ONLY ONE TIME

21:09.468 --> 21:10.569
THAT WORKS AS AN ARGUMENT, AND

21:10.636 --> 21:12.671
IT'S WHEN YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT

21:12.738 --> 21:14.573
THE MILWAUKEE BREWERS

21:14.640 --> 21:14.973
SAUSAGE RACE.

21:15.040 --> 21:16.108
NOW, WHY DO A BUNCH OF SAUSAGES

21:16.174 --> 21:16.775
RACE AROUND THE FIELD BEFORE THE

21:16.842 --> 21:17.709
BOTTOM OF THE SIXTH INNING?

21:17.776 --> 21:18.276
BECAUSE THAT'S JUST THE WAY

21:18.343 --> 21:20.579
IT'S BEEN.

21:20.646 --> 21:21.346
IT DOESN'T MAKE SENSE,

21:21.413 --> 21:22.581
AND MAY IT NEVER CHANGE.

21:22.648 --> 21:25.150
LONG LIVE THE RACING SAUSAGES.

21:25.217 --> 21:26.685
AND THERE ARE EXAMPLES ALL OVER

21:26.752 --> 21:28.387
THE COUNTRY OF UTILITIES

21:28.453 --> 21:28.954
GETTING IN THE WAY OF PEOPLE

21:29.021 --> 21:30.355
USING SOLAR ENERGY.

21:30.422 --> 21:32.424
THE ARGUMENT BEING, IF PEOPLE

21:32.491 --> 21:33.025
START LEAVING THE GRID AND

21:33.091 --> 21:34.693
GENERATING THEIR OWN POWER, THEN

21:34.760 --> 21:36.261
OVER TIME, THE COST IS GOING TO

21:36.328 --> 21:37.129
GO UP FOR EVERYONE LEFT BEHIND.

21:37.195 --> 21:39.498
AND LOOK, THERE IS A LONGER

21:39.564 --> 21:41.066
CONVERSATION TO BE HAD ABOUT THE

21:41.133 --> 21:42.267
PROPER WAY TO BILL PEOPLE WHO

21:42.334 --> 21:44.002
USE SOLAR PANELS.

21:44.069 --> 21:46.071
BUT MAKING IT COST PROHIBITIVE

21:46.138 --> 21:47.873
IS DEFINITELY NOT THE ANSWER.

21:47.939 --> 21:49.074
AND IF YOU'RE THINKING,

21:49.141 --> 21:50.709
"SHOULDN'T THERE BE SOMEONE WHO

21:50.776 --> 21:52.077
CAN REIN THESE COMPANIES IN?"

21:52.144 --> 21:53.311
WELL, IN THEORY, THERE IS.

21:53.378 --> 21:54.146
MOST STATES HAVE PUBLIC UTILITY

21:54.212 --> 21:55.714
COMMISSIONS.

21:55.781 --> 21:57.149
THEY'RE RESPONSIBLE FOR THINGS

21:57.215 --> 21:58.617
LIKE SIGNING OFF ON ANY BIG

21:58.684 --> 21:59.885
INVESTMENTS PROPOSED AND ALSO

21:59.951 --> 22:02.087
OVERSEEING THE SETTING OF RATES.

22:02.154 --> 22:04.122
UNFORTUNATELY, MANY ARE BADLY

22:04.189 --> 22:05.757
OUTMATCHED BY THE UTILITIES

22:05.824 --> 22:09.127
THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO REGULATE.

22:09.194 --> 22:09.561
THIS CAN HAVE MAJOR

22:09.628 --> 22:10.362
CONSEQUENCES.

22:10.429 --> 22:12.097
A FEW YEARS BACK, MISSISSIPPI

22:12.164 --> 22:12.864
POWER RAN INTO MASSIVE COST

22:12.931 --> 22:14.800
OVERRUNS ON A NEW PLANT IT WAS

22:14.866 --> 22:16.635
BUILDING, WHICH WAS INITIALLY

22:16.702 --> 22:18.270
EXPECTED TO COST $1.8 BILLION

22:18.336 --> 22:20.739
BUT ENDED UP BALLOONING

22:20.806 --> 22:21.640
TO 7.5 BILLION.

22:21.707 --> 22:22.741
AND IN HINDSIGHT, THERE WERE

22:22.808 --> 22:24.276
OBVIOUS RED FLAGS THAT YOU'D

22:24.342 --> 22:25.444
HOPE THE STATE COMMISSION

22:25.510 --> 22:28.280
WOULD'VE BEEN MORE WARY OF FROM

22:28.346 --> 22:28.880
THE VERY START.

22:28.947 --> 22:29.481
JUST LISTEN TO A COMPANY

22:29.548 --> 22:30.382
REPRESENTATIVE EXPLAIN HIS SIDE

22:30.449 --> 22:31.950
OF THE STORY.

22:32.017 --> 22:34.686
>> CAN YOU TELL US WHY THE

22:34.753 --> 22:37.355
PROJECT IS OVER BUDGET AND ALSO

22:37.422 --> 22:39.191
BEHIND SCHEDULE?

22:39.257 --> 22:40.392
>> I WOULD TELL YOU THAT IF WE

22:40.459 --> 22:41.593
MADE ANY ERRORS IN JUDGMENT AT

22:41.660 --> 22:43.495
ALL, ANY MISSTEPS, IS THAT WHEN

22:43.562 --> 22:45.097
WE TOOK THAT PROPOSAL TO THE

22:45.163 --> 22:48.667
COMMISSION, WE WERE ONLY AT

22:48.734 --> 22:49.234
BETWEEN 10 OR 15% OF DESIGN.

22:49.301 --> 22:51.436
AND SO I THINK IT'S --

22:51.503 --> 22:52.704
THE LITTLE ENGINEERING THAT WE

22:52.771 --> 22:54.072
HAD DONE AT THAT PARTICULAR

22:54.139 --> 22:54.873
POINT IN TIME THAT HAS SORT OF

22:54.940 --> 22:56.875
COME BACK TO HAUNT US

22:56.942 --> 22:57.509
A LITTLE BIT IN TERMS OF COST

22:57.576 --> 22:58.910
AND SCHEDULE.

22:58.977 --> 23:04.082
>> WAIT.

23:04.149 --> 23:04.983
LET ME GET THIS STRAIGHT.

23:05.050 --> 23:06.351
THE PLANT WAS ONLY 10% TO 15%

23:06.418 --> 23:06.918
DESIGNED, AND THE COMMISSION

23:06.985 --> 23:07.753
LET IT GO AHEAD ANYWAY?

23:07.819 --> 23:08.386
THAT'S NOT HOW DESIGNING COMPLEX

23:08.453 --> 23:09.621
ENERGY PLANTS SHOULD WORK,

23:09.688 --> 23:11.523
THAT'S NOT EVEN HOW DESIGNING

23:11.590 --> 23:13.325
LEGO SETS WORK, WHICH IS WHY

23:13.391 --> 23:14.593
YOU'VE NEVER SEEN ONE CALLED

23:14.659 --> 23:15.193
"A LITTLE TREE AND YOU FIGURE

23:15.260 --> 23:17.095
OUT THE REST."

23:17.162 --> 23:18.530
NOW, IN MISSISSIPPI'S CASE,

23:18.597 --> 23:28.974
THE PROBLEM SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN

23:29.040 --> 23:30.208
A COMMISSION RUSHING TO APPROVE

23:30.275 --> 23:31.243
A PROJECT WITHOUT DOING PROPER

23:31.309 --> 23:31.877
DUE DILIGENCE.

23:31.943 --> 23:32.744
BUT IN OTHER CASES, LIKE

23:32.811 --> 23:33.378
ALABAMA'S STATE COMMISSION, THE

23:33.445 --> 23:34.146
PROBLEM SEEMS TO BE IDEOLOGICAL.

23:34.212 --> 23:35.580
IT'S BEEN DESCRIBED AS ONE OF

23:35.647 --> 23:36.348
THE MOST OPAQUE, POLITICALLY

23:36.414 --> 23:36.948
MOTIVATED AND ENVIRONMENTALLY

23:37.015 --> 23:37.482
HOSTILE COMMISSIONS IN THE

23:37.549 --> 23:37.749
COUNTRY.

23:37.816 --> 23:38.717
THEIR COMMISSIONERS ARE ACTUALLY

23:38.784 --> 23:39.351
ELECTED, AND I DO WANT TO SHOW

23:39.417 --> 23:44.456
YOU ONE CAMPAIGN AD FOR THE

23:44.523 --> 23:45.123
WOMAN WHO IS CURRENTLY RUNNING

23:45.190 --> 23:45.724
IT.

23:45.791 --> 23:46.324
>> TWINKLE'S PRIORITY IS OUR

23:46.391 --> 23:46.925
JOBS!

23:46.992 --> 23:47.659
>> WE NEED MORE CONSERVATIVES

23:47.726 --> 23:48.326
LIKE TWINKLE WHO PUT JOBS FIRST.

23:48.393 --> 23:48.994
>> TWINKLE IS A PROVEN

23:49.060 --> 23:50.796
CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN.

23:50.862 --> 23:52.664
>> WHO HAS STOOD UP AND FOUGHT

23:52.731 --> 23:53.298
THE LIBERAL SPECIAL INTEREST IN

23:53.365 --> 23:55.267
WASHINGTON.

23:55.333 --> 23:57.135
>> CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN

23:57.202 --> 23:58.537
TWINKLE ANDRESS CAVANAUGH.

23:58.603 --> 24:00.939
OUR WAY OF FIGHTING BACK.

24:01.006 --> 24:01.940
>> YEAH.

24:02.007 --> 24:05.811
THAT WOMAN IS NAMED TWINKLE.

24:05.877 --> 24:06.511
THAT IS HER ACTUAL GIVEN NAME.

24:06.578 --> 24:07.913
AS IN, WHEN SHE WAS BORN, HER

24:07.979 --> 24:08.547
PARENTS WERE ASKED, "WHAT DO YOU

24:08.613 --> 24:09.047
WANT TO NAME YOUR BABY?"

24:09.114 --> 24:09.614
AND THEY GENUINELY REPLIED,

24:09.681 --> 24:10.115
"TWINKLE.

24:10.182 --> 24:12.217
DEFINITELY TWINKLE."

24:12.284 --> 24:13.819
SHE EVEN CONFIRMED THIS HERSELF,

24:13.885 --> 24:15.053
SAYING, "MY DADDY THOUGHT

24:15.120 --> 24:16.288
I NEEDED A FANCY NAME.

24:16.354 --> 24:18.557
IT MAY BE CUTE

24:18.623 --> 24:20.158
FOR A THREE-YEAR-OLD,

24:20.225 --> 24:20.625
BUT IT GETS OLD."

24:20.692 --> 24:20.959
AND HONESTLY?

24:21.026 --> 24:21.927
I COULD SEE HOW BEING CALLED

24:21.993 --> 24:22.494
TWINKLE COULD GET OLD AFTER

24:22.561 --> 24:23.862
AWHILE.

24:23.929 --> 24:26.164
BUT LET ME SAY THIS, TWINKLE,

24:26.231 --> 24:26.998
FOR EVERYONE WHO ISN'T YOU,

24:27.065 --> 24:28.400
CALLING YOU TWINKLE

24:28.466 --> 24:33.104
WILL NEVER GET OLD.

24:33.171 --> 24:34.339
IT WILL NEVER GET OLD, TWINKLE.

24:34.406 --> 24:35.407
AND LOOK, I'M NOT SAYING TWINKLE

24:35.473 --> 24:38.243
IS A BAD COMMISSIONER BECAUSE

24:38.310 --> 24:38.710
SHE'S CALLED TWINKLE.

24:38.777 --> 24:39.244
I'M SAYING TWINKLE'S A BAD

24:39.311 --> 24:40.145
COMMISSIONER BECAUSE FOR ONE

24:40.212 --> 24:40.979
THING, WHEN THERE WAS A PUSH FOR

24:41.046 --> 24:42.113
MORE OPEN HEARINGS ON

24:42.180 --> 24:43.515
ELECTRICITY RATES IN THE STATE,

24:43.582 --> 24:44.549
SHE OUTRIGHT SAID "I WANT TO

24:44.616 --> 24:45.183
EXCLUDE THE ENVIRONMENTALISTS

24:45.250 --> 24:45.917
FROM TAKING PART IN THE

24:45.984 --> 24:47.352
PROCESS."

24:47.419 --> 24:49.154
AND SUGGESTED THAT ENVIRONMENTAL

24:49.221 --> 24:51.022
EXTREMISTS ONLY WANTED THESE

24:51.089 --> 24:52.557
OPEN PROCEEDINGS SO THEY COULD

24:52.624 --> 24:53.425
TROT OUT THEIR FANCY

24:53.491 --> 24:55.794
SAN FRANCISCO ENVIRONMENTAL

24:55.861 --> 24:56.294
LAWYERS AND JUNK SCIENCE

24:56.361 --> 24:58.563
HUCKSTERS.

24:58.630 --> 24:59.831
AND IT'S NOT JUST TWINKLE!

24:59.898 --> 25:01.166
WHEN ONE OF ALABAMA'S OTHER

25:01.233 --> 25:02.467
COMMISSIONERS, CHIP BEEKER --

25:02.534 --> 25:04.536
AGAIN, REAL NAME, BECAUSE IT

25:04.603 --> 25:06.037
SEEMS ALABAMA'S UTILITY

25:06.104 --> 25:08.740
COMMISSIONERS MUST, BY LAW,

25:08.807 --> 25:09.374
SOUND LIKE HANNA-BARBERA CARTOON

25:09.441 --> 25:13.445
CHARACTERS --

25:13.511 --> 25:15.046
WHEN CHIP BEEKER WAS RUNNING FOR

25:15.113 --> 25:15.380
HIS POSITION,

25:15.447 --> 25:16.147
HE WROTE IN AN OP-

25:16.214 --> 25:16.815
"THE SO-CALLED

25:16.882 --> 25:18.049
CLIMATE CHANGE CRISIS IS ABOUT

25:18.116 --> 25:18.884
AS REAL AS UNICORNS AND LITTLE

25:18.950 --> 25:20.518
GREEN MEN FROM MARS."

25:20.585 --> 25:21.853
WHICH IS OBVIOUSLY RIDICULOUS,

25:21.920 --> 25:24.189
BECAUSE CLIMATE CHANGE IS REAL,

25:24.256 --> 25:30.528
AND UNICORNS DO NOT EXIST.

25:30.595 --> 25:30.729
SADLY.

25:30.795 --> 25:32.764
ALTHOUGH IF YOU'RE IN THE MARKET

25:32.831 --> 25:33.832
FOR A MAJESTIC CREATURE WITH A

25:33.899 --> 25:36.668
LOT OF HORN, THIS GUY MAY BE

25:36.735 --> 25:38.770
ABLE TO HELP YOU.

25:38.837 --> 25:40.672
AND LOOK, HAVING A COMMISSION

25:40.739 --> 25:41.706
RUN BY SCIENCE-DENYING

25:41.773 --> 25:43.041
IDEOLOGUES IS BAD ENOUGH.

25:43.108 --> 25:45.110
BUT IN OTHER STATES, PUBLIC

25:45.176 --> 25:46.344
OFFICIALS CAN APPEAR FULLY IN

25:46.411 --> 25:47.913
UTILITIES' POCKETS.

25:47.979 --> 25:49.281
TAKE OHIO.

25:49.347 --> 25:51.383
A FEW YEARS BACK, A BIG UTILITY

25:51.449 --> 25:53.318
THERE, FIRSTENERGY, WAS CAUGHT

25:53.385 --> 25:55.120
UP IN THIS MASSIVE SCANDAL.

25:55.186 --> 25:56.955
>> OHIO HOUSE SPEAKER LARRY

25:57.022 --> 25:58.023
HOUSEHOLDER AND FOUR OTHERS HAVE

25:58.089 --> 25:58.857
BEEN CHARGED WITH RACKETEERING,

25:58.924 --> 26:00.992
ACCUSED BY THE FEDS OF FUNNELING

26:01.059 --> 26:03.695
MILLIONS FROM THE ENERGY COMPANY

26:03.762 --> 26:05.563
INTO A 501C4 DARK MONEY GROUP

26:05.630 --> 26:07.265
CALLED GENERATION NOW.

26:07.332 --> 26:08.400
>> OKAY, FIRST.

26:08.466 --> 26:10.568
"GENERATION NOW" SOUNDS LIKE

26:10.635 --> 26:11.536
A FAILED '90s BOY BAND WHOSE

26:11.603 --> 26:12.904
MEMBERS ARE ALL NOW SPOKESMEN

26:12.971 --> 26:14.239
FOR DIFFERENT CRYPTOCURRENCY

26:14.306 --> 26:14.506
COMPANIES.

26:14.572 --> 26:16.274
BUT VERY BASICALLY,

26:16.341 --> 26:17.108
WHAT HAPPENED THERE IS THAT

26:17.175 --> 26:19.077
FIRSTENERGY FUNNELED SIXTY

26:19.144 --> 26:20.812
MILLION DOLLARS TO THE SPEAKER

26:20.879 --> 26:23.081
OF THE OHIO HOUSE, TO GET HIM TO

26:23.148 --> 26:24.816
PASS A BILL, H.B. 6, THAT'S BEEN

26:24.883 --> 26:25.450
CALLED THE WORST ENERGY BILL OF

26:25.517 --> 26:27.485
THE 21ST CENTURY.

26:27.552 --> 26:29.554
NOW, I HAVE TO TELL YOU.

26:29.621 --> 26:31.589
THE HOUSE SPEAKER IN QUESTION

26:31.656 --> 26:32.724
DENIES WRONGDOING AND IS STILL

26:32.791 --> 26:34.492
AWAITING TRIAL.

26:34.559 --> 26:35.460
BUT WHAT'S VERY CLEAR IS THAT

26:35.527 --> 26:36.928
FIRSTENERGY WAS WORKING VERY

26:36.995 --> 26:37.762
HARD TO INFLUENCE THE

26:37.829 --> 26:40.165
DECISION-MAKING PROCESS.

26:40.231 --> 26:40.832
THEY ACTUALLY PAID THE CHAIRMAN

26:40.899 --> 26:44.936
OF THE STATE'S UTILITY

26:45.003 --> 26:45.537
COMMISSION $22 MILLION IN

26:45.603 --> 26:46.705
CONSULTING FEES IN THE YEARS

26:46.771 --> 26:48.039
DIRECTLY PRECEDING HIM BECOMING

26:48.106 --> 26:49.007
THEIR REGULATOR.

26:49.074 --> 26:51.309
AND WHILE HE DENIES DOING

26:51.376 --> 26:53.878
ANYTHING IMPROPER, I WILL POINT

26:53.945 --> 26:55.080
OUT THAT ON THE VERY DAY THE

26:55.146 --> 26:56.815
BILL PASSED, FIRST ENERGY'S

26:56.881 --> 26:57.382
CEO WROTE TO HIM, SAYING --

26:57.449 --> 26:58.583
AND I QUOTE --

26:58.650 --> 27:00.118
"H.B. 6,

27:00.185 --> 27:02.954
FUCK ANYBODY WHO AIN'T US."

27:03.021 --> 27:04.422
WHICH IS VERY COOL.

27:04.489 --> 27:06.458
AND JUST SO YOU KNOW, THE MAN

27:06.524 --> 27:08.526
WHO WROTE THAT IS THIS GUY, WHO

27:08.593 --> 27:09.761
LOOKS LIKE HE'S LEFT LENGTHY

27:09.828 --> 27:12.263
REVIEWS FOR MULTIPLE GAS GRILLS

27:12.330 --> 27:12.664
ON HomeDepot.com.

27:12.731 --> 27:14.265
THIS MAN WROTE THE WORDS

27:14.332 --> 27:16.468
"FUCK ANYBODY WHO AIN'T US."

27:16.534 --> 27:18.236
THIS OLD WHITE MAN TYPED THOSE

27:18.303 --> 27:19.771
PRECISE WORDS WITH HIS OLD

27:19.838 --> 27:22.774
WHITE FINGERS.

27:22.841 --> 27:25.043
OUR UTILITY SYSTEM

27:25.110 --> 27:26.644
LARGELY CONSISTS OF FOR-PROFIT

27:26.711 --> 27:28.146
COMPANIES WITH MONOPOLIES OVER

27:28.213 --> 27:30.448
AN ESSENTIAL SERVICE, BUILDING

27:30.515 --> 27:31.916
AS MUCH SHIT AS POSSIBLE SO THEY

27:31.983 --> 27:33.218
CAN PASS THE COST ALONG TO YOU

27:33.284 --> 27:35.120
ON YOUR ELECTRIC BILL.

27:35.186 --> 27:37.288
AND TO SEE JUST HOW BAD ALL THIS

27:37.355 --> 27:40.592
CAN GET, LET'S GO BACK TO PG&E,

27:40.658 --> 27:41.126
ARGUABLY CALIFORNIA'S MOST

27:41.192 --> 27:42.394
HATED COMPANY.

27:42.460 --> 27:45.096
IN FACT, A QUICK SKIM THROUGH

27:45.163 --> 27:48.166
ANY PG&E AFFILIATE'S YELP PAGE

27:48.233 --> 27:49.067
GIVES YOU JUST A TASTE OF THAT,

27:49.134 --> 27:51.002
BECAUSE YOU'LL FIND REVIEWS

27:51.069 --> 27:51.569
LIKE, "ABSOLUTE SHIT SHOW."

27:51.636 --> 27:52.904
"FUCKING GARBAGE COMPANY."

27:52.971 --> 27:53.505
"FUCK YOU, PG&E.

27:53.571 --> 27:55.273
YOUR DAY WILL COME."

27:57.442 --> 27:59.044
"THE ACTUAL TECHNICIANS LOVELY.

27:59.110 --> 28:00.879
OFTEN HOT, TOO BOOT.

28:01.880 --> 28:02.680
HIT OR MISS.

28:02.747 --> 28:03.248
EITHER DISMISSIVE AND STUPID

28:03.314 --> 28:04.115
OR THOUGHTFUL AND KIND.

28:04.182 --> 28:05.250
CORPORATION ITSELF

28:05.316 --> 28:11.489
EVIL EMPIRE PERSONIFIED."

28:11.556 --> 28:13.558
WHICH IS A LOT MORE NUANCED THAN

28:13.625 --> 28:14.259
YOU TYPICALLY FIND

28:14.325 --> 28:15.260
IN YELP REVIEWS.

28:15.326 --> 28:16.194
LOOK, I UNDERSTAND THAT THE

28:16.261 --> 28:16.761
LOWEST RANKING, SMOKING HOT

28:16.828 --> 28:17.395
EMPLOYEE THAT I INTERFACED WITH

28:17.462 --> 28:18.296
ISN'T TO BLAME FOR THE COMPANY'S

28:18.363 --> 28:18.930
LARGER STRUCTURAL PROBLEMS.

28:18.997 --> 28:20.165
BUT FOR THE RECORD,

28:20.231 --> 28:20.732
FUCK EVERYONE IN THE C-SUITE

28:20.799 --> 28:22.467
WITH A CACTUS.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.636
AND YOU CAN SEE WHY CALIFORNIANS

28:24.702 --> 28:26.838
HATE PG&E SO MUCH.

28:26.905 --> 28:28.706
IN JUST ONE THREE-YEAR TIMESPAN,

28:28.773 --> 28:29.774
IT WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR AROUND

28:29.841 --> 28:31.443
1,500 FIRES.

28:31.509 --> 28:33.211
THAT'S AN AVERAGE OF MORE THAN

28:33.278 --> 28:35.680
ONE FIRE A DAY.

28:35.747 --> 28:37.115
AND AT THAT POINT, PG&E ARE LESS

28:37.182 --> 28:38.583
A UTILITY AND MORE A FIRE

28:38.650 --> 28:40.018
COMPANY THAT OCCASIONALLY ALSO

28:40.085 --> 28:42.220
DELIVERS ELECTRICITY

28:42.287 --> 28:42.620
TO PEOPLE'S HOMES.

28:42.687 --> 28:44.722
AND SO MANY OF PG&E'S PROBLEMS

28:44.789 --> 28:45.256
STEM FROM THE WAY THEY'RE

28:45.323 --> 28:46.858
INCENTIVIZED TO OPERATE.

28:46.925 --> 28:48.760
BECAUSE REMEMBER, THEIR PROFITS

28:48.827 --> 28:50.261
ARE PEGGED TO MONEY THEY SPEND

28:50.328 --> 28:52.497
ON NEW INFRASTRUCTURE THEY

28:52.564 --> 28:54.065
BUILD, NOT ON WHAT THEY SPEND

28:54.132 --> 28:54.833
MAINTAINING IT OR THE AREA

28:54.899 --> 28:56.334
AROUND IT.

28:56.401 --> 28:57.569
AND WHEN YOU DON'T MAINTAIN

28:57.635 --> 29:00.171
EQUIPMENT, EVENTUALLY IT FAILS.

29:00.238 --> 29:03.374
THAT OLD HOOK THAT BROKE

29:03.441 --> 29:04.476
AND STARTED THE CAMP FIRE

29:04.542 --> 29:05.343
WAS 97 YEARS OLD.

29:05.410 --> 29:06.711
AND IT'S NOT EVEN THEIR ONLY

29:06.778 --> 29:07.245
HOOK THAT WAS DANGEROUSLY

29:07.312 --> 29:09.581
WORN DOWN.

29:09.647 --> 29:11.249
>> THIS HOOK FOUND A COUPLE OF

29:11.316 --> 29:12.951
MILES UP THE LINE FROM WHERE THE

29:13.017 --> 29:13.618
CAMP FIRE STARTED SHOWS JUST HOW

29:13.685 --> 29:15.687
BAD THINGS GOT.

29:15.753 --> 29:18.089
A GROOVE MORE THAN HALFWAY

29:18.156 --> 29:20.625
THROUGH THE METAL FROM DECADES

29:20.692 --> 29:21.559
OF GRINDING AGAINST THE HOLE

29:21.626 --> 29:22.627
IT HUNG FROM.

29:22.694 --> 29:24.963
>> HOLY SHIT.

29:25.029 --> 29:26.431
"DECADES OF GRINDING" ISN'T

29:26.498 --> 29:28.399
EXACTLY A PHRASE YOU WANT TO

29:28.466 --> 29:29.334
ASSOCIATE WITH A VITAL PIECE OF

29:29.400 --> 29:31.069
OUR POWER GRID.

29:31.136 --> 29:32.804
IT'S BARELY A PHRASE YOU WANT TO

29:32.871 --> 29:33.371
HEAR AT YOUR GRANDPARENTS'

29:33.438 --> 29:36.341
50TH ANNIVERSARY.

29:36.407 --> 29:37.242
I MEAN, YOU'RE HAPPY FOR THEM.

29:37.308 --> 29:38.309
IT'S OBVIOUSLY WHAT'S KEPT THEM

29:38.376 --> 29:39.777
TOGETHER FOR SO LONG.

29:39.844 --> 29:43.982
YOU JUST DON'T WANT TO HEAR IT.

29:44.048 --> 29:45.283
AND IT'S NOT LIKE PG&E DIDN'T

29:45.350 --> 29:46.751
HAVE THE MONEY TO PERFORM BASIC

29:46.818 --> 29:48.620
MAINTENANCE, BECAUSE IN THE FIVE

29:48.686 --> 29:49.187
YEARS BEFORE THE CAMP FIRE,

29:49.254 --> 29:50.221
IT ISSUED OVER 5 BILLION

29:50.288 --> 29:52.957
IN DIVIDENDS TO SHAREHOLDERS.

29:53.024 --> 29:56.928
LOOK, CLEARLY, THIS ISN'T A

29:56.995 --> 29:57.562
SYSTEM WHERE YOU, THE CUSTOMER,

29:57.629 --> 29:58.329
ARE GOING TO BE PRIORITIZED.

29:58.396 --> 29:59.631
IF ANYTHING, THE MODEL ONLY

29:59.697 --> 30:02.534
MAKES SENSE IF THE COMPANY'S

30:02.600 --> 30:03.635
SHAREHOLDERS ARE VIEWED AS THE

30:03.701 --> 30:04.335
CUSTOMER AND YOUR BILLS ARE THE

30:04.402 --> 30:05.436
PRODUCT.

30:05.503 --> 30:07.172
AND WHILE YOU WOULD HOPE ELECTED

30:07.238 --> 30:09.073
OFFICIALS IN CALIFORNIA WOULD

30:09.140 --> 30:12.744
CRACK DOWN ON PG&E, MANY TAKE

30:12.810 --> 30:13.378
MONEY FROM THEM AND DON'T SEEM

30:13.444 --> 30:16.681
TO SEE ANYTHING WRONG WITH THAT.

30:16.748 --> 30:18.616
JUST WATCH AS CALIFORNIA'S

30:18.683 --> 30:20.151
GOVERNOR BLOWS OFF

30:20.218 --> 30:20.685
A PRETTY POINTED QUESTION.

30:20.752 --> 30:21.219
>> PG&E WAS CONVICTED OF A

30:21.286 --> 30:22.086
FEDERAL -- OF SIX FEDERAL

30:22.153 --> 30:23.555
FELONIES IN 2016.

30:23.621 --> 30:25.924
AFTER THAT, YOU TOOK MORE THAN

30:25.990 --> 30:28.226
$200,000 TO HELP GET ELECTED.

30:28.293 --> 30:28.826
HOW SHOULD PEOPLE TRUST YOU TO

30:28.893 --> 30:29.427
BE RUNNING THE SHOW TO COME UP

30:29.494 --> 30:29.861
WITH THE SOLUTION?

30:29.928 --> 30:31.996
>> I, UH...

30:32.063 --> 30:33.164
I WISH YOU LUCK WITH WHATEVER

30:33.231 --> 30:34.499
YOU'RE WORKING ON,

30:34.566 --> 30:37.402
BUT THAT'S A STRANGE QUESTION.

30:37.468 --> 30:39.837
>> WAIT, IS IT, THOUGH?

30:39.904 --> 30:40.505
IS IT?

30:40.572 --> 30:41.105
BECAUSE THAT SEEMED PRETTY

30:41.172 --> 30:41.839
REASONABLE TO ME.

30:41.906 --> 30:42.707
IT'S NOT LIKE THAT REPORTER

30:42.774 --> 30:44.509
ASKED, "MR. GOVERNOR!

30:44.576 --> 30:45.076
WHY DO YOU THINK THE WIGGLES

30:45.143 --> 30:48.046
HAD PRINCESS DIANA KILLED?"

30:48.112 --> 30:48.613
THAT IS A STRANGE QUESTION.

30:48.680 --> 30:49.113
THERE WAS NO BIG RED CAR

30:49.180 --> 30:50.481
ANYWHERE NEAR THE SCENE.

30:50.548 --> 30:51.115
BUT WHAT WHAT HE JUST ASKED YOU

30:51.182 --> 30:53.017
DESERVED A PROPER ANSWER.

30:53.084 --> 30:56.221
AND YET, FRUSTRATINGLY, IF YOU

30:56.287 --> 30:57.188
LIVE IN CALIFORNIA AND PG&E IS

30:57.255 --> 30:58.289
YOUR PROVIDER, THERE'S NOTHING

30:58.356 --> 30:58.856
YOU CAN DO.

30:58.923 --> 31:04.028
EVERY TIME YOU TURN YOUR LIGHTS

31:04.095 --> 31:05.296
ON, YOU'RE REMINDED THAT YOUR

31:05.363 --> 31:06.564
UTILITY HAS KILLED PEOPLE, AND

31:06.631 --> 31:08.533
THE ONLY REAL RECOURSE YOU HAVE

31:08.600 --> 31:09.033
IS GIVING THEM A SHITTY

31:09.100 --> 31:09.867
YELP REVIEW.

31:09.934 --> 31:11.135
SO HOW DO WE FIX THIS?

31:11.202 --> 31:12.704
WELL, IF WE WERE ABLE TO START

31:12.770 --> 31:13.271
OUR POWER GRID OVER FROM

31:13.338 --> 31:14.906
SCRATCH, WHAT WE'D PROBABLY DO

31:14.973 --> 31:15.540
IS MAKE UTILITIES PUBLICLY OWNED

31:15.607 --> 31:16.975
AND RUN BY THE GOVERNMENT.

31:17.041 --> 31:18.643
IT WOULDN'T FIX EVERYTHING --

31:18.710 --> 31:20.211
THINGS MIGHT STILL GO WRONG --

31:20.278 --> 31:20.979
BUT YOU'D REMOVE SO MANY OF THE

31:21.045 --> 31:23.147
WORST INCENTIVES HERE.

31:23.214 --> 31:24.415
UNFORTUNATELY, TRANSITIONING NOW

31:24.482 --> 31:25.116
WOULD BE HUGELY EXPENSIVE

31:25.183 --> 31:26.818
AND IN ALL LIKELIHOOD ISN'T

31:26.884 --> 31:28.286
HAPPENING ANYTIME SOON.

31:28.353 --> 31:31.289
BUT THERE ARE SMALLER STEPS

31:31.356 --> 31:32.090
WE SHOULD ALSO BE TAKING IN THE

31:32.156 --> 31:32.624
MEANTIME.

31:32.690 --> 31:33.358
FOR INSTANCE, INSTEAD OF HAVING

31:33.424 --> 31:34.792
A SYSTEM WHERE UTILITIES ARE

31:34.859 --> 31:36.694
INCENTIVIZED JUST TO BUILD

31:36.761 --> 31:37.829
STUFF, WE COULD INCENTIVIZE THEM

31:37.895 --> 31:38.830
TO WORK DIRECTLY IN THE

31:38.896 --> 31:39.964
CUSTOMERS' BEST INTERESTS,

31:40.031 --> 31:40.698
BY INVESTING IN THINGS LIKE

31:40.765 --> 31:41.532
MAINTENANCE, RENEWABLES,

31:41.599 --> 31:44.102
AND ENERGY CONSERVATION.

31:44.168 --> 31:45.103
THIS IS SOMETHING KNOWN AS

31:45.169 --> 31:46.804
PERFORMANCE-BASED REGULATION,

31:46.871 --> 31:47.705
AND SEVERAL STATES

31:47.772 --> 31:51.075
ARE ALREADY TRYING IT.

31:51.142 --> 31:52.110
AS FOR THE REGULATORS, LOOK,

31:52.176 --> 31:53.144
COMMISSIONS WILL, UNFORTUNATELY,

31:53.211 --> 31:54.579
PROBABLY ALWAYS VARY IN

31:54.646 --> 31:55.146
EFFECTIVENESS DEPENDING ON

31:55.213 --> 31:57.215
WHETHER IT'S STAFFED BY PEOPLE

31:57.282 --> 31:58.783
WHO GIVE A SHIT ABOUT THIS, OR,

31:58.850 --> 31:59.317
LET'S SAY, SOMEONE NAMED

31:59.384 --> 32:01.352
TWINKLE.

32:01.419 --> 32:06.424
BUT WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT

32:06.491 --> 32:07.659
UNDER RESOURCED REGULATORS GET

32:07.725 --> 32:08.693
MORE SUPPORT,

32:08.760 --> 32:09.193
MORE ACCESS TO TECHNICAL

32:09.260 --> 32:09.861
EXPERTISE, AND MORE JURISDICTION

32:09.927 --> 32:10.628
OVER THE COMPANIES THEY MONITOR.

32:10.695 --> 32:12.130
AND AT THIS POINT, I'D USUALLY

32:12.196 --> 32:14.165
BRING OUT A MASCOT WE MADE FOR

32:14.232 --> 32:15.033
UTILITIES THAT'S REPRESENTATIVE

32:15.099 --> 32:16.301
OF JUST HOW TERRIBLE AND

32:16.367 --> 32:17.101
HORRIFYING THEY ARE.

32:17.168 --> 32:21.139
BUT AMAZINGLY, I DON'T EVEN NEED

32:21.205 --> 32:21.706
TO DO THAT, DO I?

32:21.773 --> 32:23.508
BECAUSE THEY ALREADY

32:23.574 --> 32:24.075
MADE A MURDEROUS HELL-DEMON

32:24.142 --> 32:24.776
ALMOST A HUNDRED YEARS AGO,

32:24.842 --> 32:25.643
WITH REDDY KILOWATT.

32:25.710 --> 32:27.011
SO ALL WE NEED TO DO IS BRING

32:27.078 --> 32:28.680
REDDY BACK.

32:28.746 --> 32:30.782
SO, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,

32:30.848 --> 32:33.284
I'M THRILLED TO PRESENT

32:33.351 --> 32:34.352
TO YOU THE GLORIOUS RETURN

32:34.419 --> 32:36.287
OF REDDY KILOWATT!

32:36.354 --> 32:38.256
REDDY?

32:38.323 --> 32:38.456
REDDY?

32:38.523 --> 32:39.524
WHERE ARE YOU?

32:39.590 --> 32:40.458
WHERE ARE YOU?

32:40.525 --> 32:42.527
>> HELLO, JOHN!

32:42.593 --> 32:44.929
HELLO, BOYS AND GIRLS!

32:44.996 --> 32:45.763
>> YEAH.

32:45.830 --> 32:46.531
THIS IS CREEPY.

32:46.597 --> 32:47.098
I'M ALREADY REGRETTING THIS.

32:47.165 --> 32:47.832
WHERE'S THE CLOWN?

32:47.899 --> 32:48.633
WHERE'S MR. TOOT?

32:48.700 --> 32:50.635
>> HE'S DEAD, JOHN.

32:50.702 --> 32:50.968
I KILLED HIM.

32:51.035 --> 32:53.705
>> OF COURSE YOU DID.

32:53.771 --> 32:57.075
I'D LIKE TO LEAVE.

32:57.141 --> 32:57.809
THIS IS A BAD IDEA.

32:57.875 --> 33:00.044
>> WHO SAID YOU GET TO DO THAT?

33:00.111 --> 33:06.217
>> FUCK!

33:06.284 --> 33:09.687
>> THE WORLD IS MY MONOPOLY.

33:09.754 --> 33:14.192
YOUR LOCAL UTILITY IS YOUR GOD.

33:14.258 --> 33:16.060
I AM YOUR GOD.

33:16.127 --> 33:17.829
SB WHEN I CANNOT BELIEVE I'M

33:17.895 --> 33:20.598
SAYING THIS BUT YOU ARE TOO GOOD

33:20.665 --> 33:22.433
AT REPRESENTING HOW SHITTY

33:22.500 --> 33:26.504
UTILITY COMPANIES R.

33:26.571 --> 33:29.340
>> YOU HAVE NO IDEA.

33:29.407 --> 33:31.642
I COULD KILL YOU RIGHT NOW.

33:31.709 --> 33:32.777
WHAT HAPPENED TO THE LIGHTS?!

33:32.844 --> 33:33.411
>> BLACKOUTS HAPPEN, JOHN.

33:33.478 --> 33:34.078
>> TURN THE LIGHTS BACK

33:34.145 --> 33:34.812
ON, YOU FREAK!

33:34.879 --> 33:36.514
>> YOU CAN DO IT YOURSELF, JOHN!

33:36.581 --> 33:38.149
JUST GO AHEAD AND PULL THAT

33:38.216 --> 33:39.884
LEVER!

33:39.951 --> 33:41.786
>> WAIT, THIS ONE HERE?

33:41.853 --> 33:44.622
>> UH-HUH.

33:44.689 --> 33:47.925
>> OKAY.

33:47.992 --> 33:48.726
>> UH-HUH.

33:48.793 --> 33:49.527
HA HA.

33:49.594 --> 33:52.263
I'M GONNA GET SUCH A FINE

33:52.330 --> 33:54.532
FOR THAT.

33:54.599 --> 33:59.604
THAT'S OUR SHOW.

33:59.670 --> 34:00.471
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

34:00.538 --> 34:01.072
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK FOR ANOTHER

34:01.139 --> 34:01.672
EPISODE OF "LAST WEEK TONIGHT"

34:01.739 --> 34:02.106
WITH REDDY KILOWATT.

34:02.173 --> 34:04.041
HA, HA.

34:04.108 --> 34:14.118
BYE-BYE.
