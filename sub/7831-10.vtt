14:41.347 --> 14:43.941

- Well...

14:44.049 --> 14:47.348
at least the burglar's
having a merry Christmas.

14:52.258 --> 14:54.726
- <i>Bart. You're up early.</i>
- I couldn't sleep.

14:54.827 --> 14:56.692
What's wrong?

14:56.795 --> 15:01.164
[Sighs]
There was no burglar.

15:01.267 --> 15:03.497
- No burglar?
- What does he mean, no burglar?

15:03.602 --> 15:06.070
I accidentally burned up the tree...

15:06.171 --> 15:08.264
and the presents.

15:08.374 --> 15:10.274
I'm really sorry.

15:11.877 --> 15:15.176
- You little-
- <i>[Homer] Lisa, no!</i>

15:15.281 --> 15:20.378
- Your hands are too weak.
- [Gagging]

15:20.486 --> 15:23.387

- I'm gonna kill him.
- No, I'm killing him first.

15:30.162 --> 15:32.187
Kent Brockman here
for a follow-up...

15:32.298 --> 15:35.597
with Springfield's favorite
hard-luck family, the Simpsons.

15:35.701 --> 15:38.932
Folks, any words for the Christmas thief,
if he's watching?

15:39.038 --> 15:41.768
Eh, yes, Kent.

15:41.874 --> 15:43.842
Uh, hello, jerk.

15:43.943 --> 15:48.004
We may never find you and
we should probably all stop looking.

15:48.113 --> 15:51.913
But one thing's for sure,
you do exist.

15:52.017 --> 15:56.044
Strong words.
Strong, bewildering words.

15:56.155 --> 16:00.751
- Also, we want to thank the whole
town for their generosity.
- <i>[Dog Growling]</i>

16:00.859 --> 16:03.726
Hey, look.
It's little Bart's fire truck.

16:06.665 --> 16:10.567
<i>[Gasps]</i>
<i>Little Lisa's sweater. Little Homer's sausage.</i>

16:10.669 --> 16:13.069
What in the name of
holy hell is going on here?

16:13.172 --> 16:15.970
Oh, it's true.
We werert robbed.

16:16.075 --> 16:19.670
That part we made up,
but the rest is true. [Sobbing]

16:19.778 --> 16:22.747
Wait.
He's just covering for me.

16:22.848 --> 16:26.716
I destroyed the presents. Then I buried
the evidence. And I acted alone.

16:26.819 --> 16:29.379
So the family never knew
about any of this?

16:29.488 --> 16:34.448
Well, the boy told us, but that was
after we filed a phony police report.

16:34.560 --> 16:37.051
And after we spent all
the townspeople's money.

16:37.162 --> 16:41.292
So you can see why my husband
had to lie to you a moment ago.

16:41.400 --> 16:43.800
So this was all a scam.

16:43.902 --> 16:45.802
And on Christmas.

16:45.904 --> 16:49.362
Yeah, Jesus must be
spinning in his grave.

16:49.475 --> 16:53.468
We gave them our vitamin money.

16:55.781 --> 16:57.681
Come back when
you get some parents.

16:57.783 --> 17:02.243
In my long career,
I've seen some pretty shabby things...

17:02.354 --> 17:06.483
but this putrid fraud
"out-stinks" them all.

17:06.592 --> 17:08.890
<i>[Man]</i>
<i>And cut.</i>

17:08.993 --> 17:11.121
[Chuckling]
I just wanna thank you folks so much.

17:11.230 --> 17:13.925
This has turned out to be
a great, great story for me.

17:23.642 --> 17:25.541
I think they're
running out of tomatoes.

17:25.644 --> 17:28.169
- <i>[Thud]</i>
- Yeah, but they still got plenty of pumpkins.

17:28.280 --> 17:31.738

Homie, I'm so ashamed.

17:31.850 --> 17:34.614

- Oh, there they are.
- Ah, it's the swindlers.

17:54.306 --> 17:56.774
- The Simpsons.
- Ah, them stinkir liars.

17:56.875 --> 17:58.934
Well, there goes
Christmas dinner.

17:59.044 --> 18:01.410
Oh, head of the line.

18:01.513 --> 18:04.209
A family could get used to
being shunned, huh? Huh?

18:08.687 --> 18:12.054
Hey, look, Sean.
It's that family everybody hates.

18:12.157 --> 18:14.819
Whatever.

18:16.228 --> 18:18.594
Uh, Miss Hoover.
Miss Hoover.

18:18.697 --> 18:22.599
Forget it, Lisa. I'm not teaching you
anything until I get my money back.

18:22.701 --> 18:24.635
Now turn your desk around
and stop learning.

18:28.307 --> 18:30.207

Oh, right. Yeah.

18:41.920 --> 18:44.684
Then while we're gone,
you take our snacks.

18:44.790 --> 18:48.317

- You tell him, Lenny. [Coughing]

Oh, great.
Now we have to send him a card.

I know you're used to
getting hate mail, but I'm not.

19:03.775 --> 19:08.007
There's only one way out. We've gotta
give this greedy town its money back.

19:43.482 --> 19:47.213

get used to being pariahs.

19:47.319 --> 19:49.719
There's no shame
in being a pariah.

19:53.025 --> 19:57.121
Oh, no. There's

Consider your debt repaid, neighbor.

20:47.012 --> 20:48.912
And then some.

20:56.888 --> 21:00.949
Look. I know this has been
a stressful holiday.

21:01.059 --> 21:06.588
But in a way, having nothing
reminds us how lucky we really are.

21:06.698 --> 21:08.996

- We still have each other.

21:09.101 --> 21:11.831

- But we would've had each other anyway.
- <i>Yeah, plus lots of other stuff.</i>

21:15.774 --> 21:20.211
Maybe so, but there's one thing
they forgot to take away from us.

This washcloth.
