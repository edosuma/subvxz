{\an5}I don't want your man!

42:02.152 --> 42:03.954
Get her the (bleep)
out of here!

42:04.021 --> 42:08.559
{\an5}(announcer)
...or hate, life will
definitely suck on the beach.

42:08.626 --> 42:10.928
{\an1}...this (bleep),
mother(bleep)!

42:10.995 --> 42:15.933
{\an5}(announcer)
But before they leave, they'll
be put to one final test.

42:16.000 --> 42:19.703
{\an5}Are you completely
over your ex?

42:16.000 --> 42:19.703
{\an1}(bleep)!

42:19.770 --> 42:21.138
(thunder)

42:24.808 --> 42:27.745
{\an8}♪♪
