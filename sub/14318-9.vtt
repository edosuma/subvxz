00:01.750 --> 00:02.708
[narrator]
Previously on X-Men.

00:02.708 --> 00:04.250
You try to escape,

00:04.250 --> 00:05.833
the collars will be
reactivated at once.

00:06.708 --> 00:10.125
If you try to remove
your collar, it will explode

00:10.125 --> 00:11.416
and destroy you.

00:11.416 --> 00:12.583
Now, get to work!

00:12.583 --> 00:14.750
Now! Gambit! Jubilee!

00:15.958 --> 00:17.208
My powers!

00:17.208 --> 00:18.708
[Gyrich] The collars you use

00:18.708 --> 00:20.458
to control your mutants.

00:20.458 --> 00:23.000
They were invented
by a scientist in Scotland.

00:24.250 --> 00:25.250
It's him.

00:25.958 --> 00:27.208
Who are you?

00:27.208 --> 00:29.000
The Wild Man of Borneo.

00:29.000 --> 00:30.333
[Hodge] His name is Cable.

00:31.000 --> 00:33.416
He was a mercenary
in the Leader's army,

00:33.416 --> 00:36.416
until he found out the Leader
wasn't the champion of democracy

00:36.416 --> 00:38.291
he claimed to be.

00:38.291 --> 00:40.625
So he threw his wages back
in the Leader's face

00:40.625 --> 00:42.708
and took to the hills
to start a revolution.

00:42.708 --> 00:44.333
See you around.

00:44.333 --> 00:46.625
[Gyrich] How much is
it worth to you

00:46.625 --> 00:49.708
to have that man
Cable eliminated?

00:49.708 --> 00:50.708
Uh-uh.

00:54.583 --> 00:58.000
[Leader] Cable lives by his
code, but he will not live long.

02:00.458 --> 02:02.416
[footsteps approaching]

02:04.958 --> 02:07.000
[Gisela] I should be
frightened, Warren.

02:07.000 --> 02:08.458
What do you mean?

02:08.458 --> 02:11.458
They say you keep
a mad scientist up here.

02:11.458 --> 02:14.708
Dr. Frankenstein, perhaps?

02:14.708 --> 02:18.500
His name's Gottfried Adler.
He's an expert on genetics.

02:18.500 --> 02:20.208
But he's not here.

02:20.208 --> 02:22.291
I sent him to Scotland
to do research.

02:22.291 --> 02:24.125
We're alone, then.

02:24.125 --> 02:25.708
I'd better take you home.

02:25.708 --> 02:28.291
Why must you
always push me away?

02:28.291 --> 02:30.750
You wouldn't want
to get close to me.

02:30.750 --> 02:33.333
Not if you knew
what I was really like.

02:38.875 --> 02:39.875
[door knob turns]

02:48.083 --> 02:49.458
Aah!

02:50.291 --> 02:52.250
Are you Adler?

02:52.250 --> 02:56.166
I'm Warren Worthington III.
Who are you?

03:02.500 --> 03:06.583
Next time you take a shot at
somebody, make sure you hit him.

03:06.583 --> 03:07.833
I'll remember that.

03:11.458 --> 03:12.833
[screaming]

03:15.375 --> 03:17.375
You got a short memory.

03:17.375 --> 03:18.583
[Gisela] Warren?

03:22.583 --> 03:23.833
[grunting]

03:26.083 --> 03:30.125
Pal, you picked the wrong chalet
to terrorize.

03:33.958 --> 03:38.000
What's going on? Warren?
Are you all right?

03:38.000 --> 03:39.125
[gasps]

03:39.125 --> 03:41.000
What? Where's Warren?

03:41.000 --> 03:42.583
He's all right.

03:42.583 --> 03:45.458
My weapon's set to stun.
Where's Adler?

03:45.458 --> 03:48.000
He's... he's gone to Scotland.

03:48.000 --> 03:51.583
Scotland?
You mean Muir Island.

03:51.583 --> 03:53.083
Get down!

04:02.833 --> 04:04.000
[groans]

04:04.000 --> 04:05.333
Warren!

04:15.125 --> 04:16.583
Warren's gone.

04:19.875 --> 04:21.000
[gasps]

04:21.000 --> 04:22.333
Don't!

04:22.875 --> 04:25.500
No. I didn't mean to.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.208
I'm sorry.

04:36.875 --> 04:40.333
[Xavier] You created
the Center for Mutant Research,
my dear Moira.

04:40.875 --> 04:43.833
Can't you demand
to review Dr. Adler's work?

04:43.833 --> 04:46.291
Aye, I would if I could.

04:46.291 --> 04:48.291
But he's not really
part of the Center.

04:48.291 --> 04:50.166
He pays me well for everything.

04:50.166 --> 04:53.166
His one request
was to be left alone.

04:53.166 --> 04:56.833
Then you don't know if he
really can reverse mutations.

04:56.833 --> 04:59.250
I only know what he tells me.

05:01.000 --> 05:03.583
Dr. Adler?
It's Moira McTaggart.

05:03.583 --> 05:06.458
I've an old friend here
who's interested in your work.

05:06.458 --> 05:09.125
Professor Xavier from America.

05:09.125 --> 05:12.458
[Adler on intercom]
Visitors are verboten,
not allowed.

05:12.458 --> 05:15.000
You promised no interference.

05:22.958 --> 05:23.958
[grunts]

05:23.958 --> 05:25.125
Xavier?

05:26.708 --> 05:31.750
I tried to probe his mind,
but some force
came between us.

05:32.958 --> 05:35.416
Do you think Adler
could be a mutant himself?

05:35.416 --> 05:39.208
Well, now, that would explain
why he's after a cure.

05:39.208 --> 05:41.625
Don't say cure, Moira.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.625
Being a mutant isn't a disease.

05:44.625 --> 05:46.458
It's something you're born with.

05:46.458 --> 05:49.208
It's as normal as being
a traditional Homo sapien.

05:49.208 --> 05:51.708
Not all mutants
would agree with you.

05:51.708 --> 05:53.958
What do your X-Men say?

05:53.958 --> 05:57.583
I don't know. I haven't told
them about Adler's discovery.

05:58.625 --> 06:00.458
But it's time I did.

06:04.583 --> 06:07.250
That old boy Juggernaut
sure made a mess

06:07.250 --> 06:09.458
about like that Yankee general,
Sherman.

06:16.625 --> 06:19.500
Keep an eye on me, Gambit.
You might learn something.

06:23.708 --> 06:26.250
Let me put some nails
in that for you, Jean.

06:26.833 --> 06:29.333
I always did like
working with my hands.

06:29.333 --> 06:31.416
I like to work with my mind.

06:37.708 --> 06:39.500
That mortar looks
a little thick, Storm.

06:39.500 --> 06:41.291
Better add some water.

06:41.291 --> 06:44.583
Big expert.
Always giving orders.

06:44.583 --> 06:47.333
Making up for your
screw-ups, gumbo.

06:48.166 --> 06:50.583
Too bad you don't know
how to do anything

06:50.583 --> 06:53.166
but pick pockets
and steal candy from babies.

06:56.333 --> 06:57.375
[wolverine gasps]

06:57.375 --> 06:58.750
Look out!

06:59.625 --> 07:01.875
Gambit! What do you
think you're doing?

07:01.875 --> 07:04.958
He better be more careful
with his mouth.

07:04.958 --> 07:07.875
You better stop
worrying about my mouth

07:07.875 --> 07:10.750
and start worrying about these!

07:15.958 --> 07:17.958
Why don't you boys calm down?

07:17.958 --> 07:20.000
You afraid I'm gonna hurt him?

07:20.000 --> 07:23.708
I always thought you had
a soft spot for that Cajun.

07:23.708 --> 07:26.458
About as soft as you, fat-head.

07:26.458 --> 07:28.458
You gonna shut up, or am I gonna
have to help you?

07:28.458 --> 07:31.750
Hey, everybody!
Guess who wants to talk to us?

07:33.000 --> 07:37.875
Dr. Adler claims his process
can reverse genetic mutations

07:37.875 --> 07:39.958
within each cell of the body.

07:39.958 --> 07:41.000
What?

07:41.000 --> 07:43.875
You mean steal our powers?

07:43.875 --> 07:45.833
It could be used
as a weapon against us,

07:45.833 --> 07:50.458
but some mutants might welcome
the chance to become normal.

07:50.458 --> 07:52.083
Yeah? Who?

07:52.083 --> 07:53.416
[Xavier]
There's no right or wrong

07:53.416 --> 07:55.416
in choosing to remain a mutant.

07:55.416 --> 07:58.125
You have taught us to value
our powers, Professor,

07:58.125 --> 07:59.458
not for their own sake,

07:59.458 --> 08:01.583
but for what they can do
for others.

08:01.583 --> 08:05.458
You tell 'em, Storm.
No deserters in this crowd.

08:06.625 --> 08:09.875
[Xavier] Each of us will have
to make his own decision

08:10.458 --> 08:13.166
if Adler's process
really works.

08:16.583 --> 08:18.875
I'm worried about Rogue,
Cyclops.

08:18.875 --> 08:20.583
Rogue? Why?

08:20.583 --> 08:23.875
Because I know how she feels
when I touch your hand

08:23.875 --> 08:25.125
or when we kiss.

08:25.125 --> 08:27.500
Because I sense her pain.

08:28.375 --> 08:29.500
Vacation, huh?

08:31.583 --> 08:33.833
Muir Island's no good for you.

08:34.750 --> 08:37.458
How about we go to Paris
instead?

08:37.458 --> 08:40.500
How about getting
your butt out of my car?

08:43.208 --> 08:44.208
[chuckles]

08:53.416 --> 08:55.875
Let's have a kiss
before you go, huh?

09:02.625 --> 09:04.458
What's wrong, chere?

09:04.458 --> 09:06.458
You know what happens
when I touch somebody!

09:06.458 --> 09:07.875
You wanna end up
in the hospital?

09:08.583 --> 09:10.166
Maybe it's worth it, no?

09:10.166 --> 09:11.166
[exclaims angrily]

09:13.708 --> 09:16.375
[Gambit] Where you going,
Rogue? Where you going?

09:22.000 --> 09:23.000
What the--

09:52.583 --> 09:56.416
[Avalanche] Muir Island.
[scoffs] What a dump.

09:58.000 --> 10:01.375
There ain't nothing to steal
on this worthless rock.

10:01.375 --> 10:04.125
This friend of yours
better show up soon,

10:04.125 --> 10:06.333
or I'm going back to jail,

10:06.333 --> 10:08.375
just for something to do.

10:08.375 --> 10:11.125
Are we becoming
impatient, old stick?

10:11.125 --> 10:15.958
The name's Avalanche, limey, and
what we're becoming is broke.

10:18.250 --> 10:21.291
This scam of hers
better pay off big.

10:24.583 --> 10:26.500
That could be Mystique now.

10:26.500 --> 10:28.625
What do you mean "could be"?

10:28.625 --> 10:30.875
Don't you know
what she looks like?

10:30.875 --> 10:35.000
She's a shape-changer, old man.
One can never be sure.

10:37.250 --> 10:39.500
Looking for me, love?

10:39.500 --> 10:43.458
I sincerely doubt it, unless
your name's Gottfried Adler.

10:43.458 --> 10:44.708
Alas, no.

10:45.875 --> 10:47.125
[mutant gasps]

10:47.125 --> 10:50.083
[chuckles] They call me Pyro.

10:50.083 --> 10:52.333
In the mood for a hot date?

10:52.333 --> 10:53.750
In a bull's-eye.

10:55.458 --> 10:58.458
How about trying that with me?

11:01.833 --> 11:04.833
Well, all right, hon,
since you asked me nice.

11:04.833 --> 11:06.583
[Avalanche screaming]

11:21.291 --> 11:22.416
Pyro!

11:24.458 --> 11:26.083
Where'd he go?

11:31.250 --> 11:33.500
Hello? Dr. Adler?

11:33.500 --> 11:35.416
[Adler on intercom]
Visitors are verboten.

11:37.583 --> 11:39.750
I didn't fly across
the whole danged ocean

11:39.750 --> 11:41.416
to take no for an answer.

11:43.083 --> 11:44.583
What do you want?

11:44.583 --> 11:47.166
I hear you can
change people, Doctor.

11:47.583 --> 11:49.833
Change them, so they won't
be mutants anymore.

11:49.833 --> 11:52.416
You make me like other people,

11:52.416 --> 11:54.416
and you can name your own price.

11:54.416 --> 11:58.000
You have great strength
as well as great beauty.

11:58.000 --> 12:01.375
Why do you wish
to become merely normal?

12:01.375 --> 12:03.750
Because I don't wanna
live my whole life

12:03.750 --> 12:06.708
without knowing what it's like
to touch another human being.

12:06.708 --> 12:09.000
[Adler]
I will consider your request.

12:10.416 --> 12:12.583
Come back in one hour.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.708
I will have an answer
for you then.

12:16.000 --> 12:17.000
Apocalypse!

12:18.458 --> 12:20.583
You heard what she wanted?

12:20.583 --> 12:21.708
Yes.

12:22.625 --> 12:25.291
Like all people, she is a fool,

12:25.291 --> 12:28.333
but she has great powers.

12:29.000 --> 12:34.375
You will use the machine
and make her my slave.

12:42.166 --> 12:44.833
[Storm] You have taught us
to value our powers.

12:44.833 --> 12:46.583
Value our powers.

12:46.583 --> 12:48.833
[Cody]
The moon sure is pretty tonight.

12:52.125 --> 12:53.833
You ever been kissed, girl?

12:53.833 --> 12:55.250
[chuckles]

12:55.250 --> 12:57.000
I'm beginning to think
I never will be,

12:57.000 --> 12:59.958
the way you keep going on
about the moon.

13:05.333 --> 13:06.625
[Cody groans]

13:06.625 --> 13:07.750
Cody!

13:09.416 --> 13:10.833
[Rogue] Cody. Cody...

13:18.833 --> 13:19.958
Avalanche!

13:21.583 --> 13:23.250
Avalanche!

13:26.833 --> 13:29.625
Hello. You aren't Avalanche.

13:29.625 --> 13:32.000
I'm looking for Gottfried Adler.

13:32.000 --> 13:34.708
Well, of course you are,
old darling.

13:34.708 --> 13:37.000
He's such a popular fellow.

13:44.458 --> 13:46.458
Don't call me "darling."

13:56.583 --> 13:58.958
What did you do, fall in?

13:58.958 --> 14:00.375
Never mind.

14:01.416 --> 14:04.083
I've found our pot of gold.

14:04.083 --> 14:07.166
There seems to be
a local scientist

14:07.166 --> 14:09.708
who's in big demand these days.

14:09.708 --> 14:11.708
As soon as I've dried off,

14:11.708 --> 14:15.208
we shall arrange
a disappearance.

14:15.208 --> 14:19.083
And my dear friend
Mystique need never know.

14:19.083 --> 14:22.333
Your whole life will change
after the treatment.

14:23.583 --> 14:25.375
Believe me.

14:25.375 --> 14:27.083
That's what I'm here for, Doc.

14:27.083 --> 14:29.583
It may be unpleasant at first,

14:29.583 --> 14:32.000
but then you will feel nothing.

14:33.416 --> 14:34.416
[gasps]

14:37.833 --> 14:39.458
Well done, old bean.

14:41.458 --> 14:43.458
Y'all looking for a rematch?

14:43.458 --> 14:45.375
[Pyro] Perhaps another time.

14:45.375 --> 14:46.708
[Rogue groans]

14:46.708 --> 14:48.875
-Bag the good doctor.
-Right.

14:50.708 --> 14:52.708
You are making
a terrible mistake.

14:53.416 --> 14:54.708
[muffled screaming]

15:02.375 --> 15:03.500
Adler.

15:10.583 --> 15:13.250
Those boys are making me mad.

15:14.458 --> 15:15.958
[Moira] Dr. Adler!

15:15.958 --> 15:19.083
I heard a loud crash, Moira.
What's going on?

15:19.083 --> 15:20.250
I do not know.

15:29.708 --> 15:32.875
How about you carrying him
for a while?

15:33.375 --> 15:36.000
Shall we make him walk?

15:36.000 --> 15:38.708
Listen, old man... Blimey!

15:38.708 --> 15:40.500
He's a woman.

15:40.500 --> 15:42.416
He's Mystique.

15:42.416 --> 15:46.458
And you're a fool, Pyro.
I asked you to come here

15:46.458 --> 15:50.375
because I thought Apocalypse
might find some use for you.

15:50.375 --> 15:52.500
Who's Apocalypse?

15:52.500 --> 15:54.250
Haven't the foggiest.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.458
He's my master,

15:55.958 --> 15:58.375
and he'll crush you
like an insect

15:58.375 --> 16:00.333
if you interfere again!

16:00.333 --> 16:03.708
So your machine
doesn't cure mutants.

16:04.333 --> 16:07.416
It turns them
into slaves of Apocalypse.

16:07.416 --> 16:10.750
You mean you just made up
this guy Adler?

16:10.750 --> 16:15.083
He was real enough
until he met Apocalypse.

16:15.083 --> 16:18.458
Personally, I find this
frightfully confusing.

16:18.458 --> 16:20.083
[Rogue] Y'all get away from him,

16:20.083 --> 16:21.708
It gets worse.

16:21.708 --> 16:23.875
or you'll need
a doctor sure enough.

16:24.333 --> 16:26.750
I never could say
no to a woman.

16:29.875 --> 16:33.000
Back off, firefly.
I need that guy.

16:34.750 --> 16:36.375
[Pyro and Avalanche grunting]

16:39.083 --> 16:40.291
Dr. Adler?

16:43.208 --> 16:46.375
Dr. Adler, I presume.

16:47.416 --> 16:49.458
[Moira] What the devil
could have happened here?

16:49.458 --> 16:52.958
It appears that Dr. Adler
has been kidnapped.

16:52.958 --> 16:54.583
[Cyclops] Professor Xavier.

16:54.583 --> 16:57.166
[Xavier] Cyclops, Jean,
what are you doing here?

16:57.166 --> 16:58.750
Rogue's disappeared, Professor.

16:58.750 --> 17:00.875
I believe she has come here
to see Dr. Adler

17:00.875 --> 17:02.458
to undergo his treatment.

17:02.458 --> 17:05.000
If she has, she may be in danger

17:05.000 --> 17:07.333
of losing more
than her mutant powers.

17:07.750 --> 17:08.750
[grunts]

17:10.166 --> 17:12.458
[Pyro] Listen, old girl,
must we do this?

17:14.958 --> 17:18.208
I think we're all making
a terrible mistake!

17:19.125 --> 17:20.583
[Pyro exclaiming]

17:24.875 --> 17:26.333
Dr. Adler?

17:31.583 --> 17:32.708
Who are you?

17:33.458 --> 17:37.750
The name's Cable.
Last known address, Genosha.

17:37.750 --> 17:41.083
They used to turn mutants
into slaves down there.

17:41.083 --> 17:42.750
I have never heard of it.

17:42.750 --> 17:46.333
They did it with collars
that suppressed mutant powers.

17:46.333 --> 17:49.000
Collars you made.

17:49.000 --> 17:51.583
That makes you
a dangerous man.

17:52.583 --> 17:54.750
Too dangerous to live.

17:54.750 --> 17:56.375
[Rogue] Get away
from that man!

17:56.875 --> 17:58.500
What do you think you're doing?

17:58.500 --> 18:01.250
Making the world
safer for mutants.

18:11.458 --> 18:12.458
[grunts]

18:13.125 --> 18:14.583
Plasma grenade.

18:16.000 --> 18:18.250
You are making
a terrible mistake.

18:19.083 --> 18:21.875
Dr. Adler is already dead.

18:21.875 --> 18:25.166
That's kind of hard to believe,
coming from you.

18:27.000 --> 18:28.833
Do you believe me now?

18:37.208 --> 18:38.458
There's Adler.

18:43.125 --> 18:44.875
Drop the weapon.

18:44.875 --> 18:46.000
No.

18:50.333 --> 18:51.625
Look out, y'all!

18:57.708 --> 18:59.250
[Jean screams]

19:00.250 --> 19:02.375
-No!
-[Rogue] Jean!

19:04.500 --> 19:06.291
You all right, hon?

19:06.291 --> 19:09.875
Just bruised, thanks to you.
What about him?

19:09.875 --> 19:12.958
Whoever he was, it's too late
to help him now.

19:12.958 --> 19:15.333
A most extraordinary
young woman.

19:15.333 --> 19:17.125
Thank you, Rogue.

19:17.125 --> 19:19.000
You don't know how much
this means to me.

19:22.250 --> 19:24.625
But I thought you
wanted to be cured.

19:24.625 --> 19:26.458
That's what I thought, too, Doc.

19:26.458 --> 19:28.958
But there ain't
no cure for who you are.

19:28.958 --> 19:31.416
Then you must live forever

19:31.416 --> 19:34.000
in the prison
of your mutant powers.

19:34.750 --> 19:38.083
I am my powers,
and the good they can do

19:38.083 --> 19:40.458
for my friends
and for the whole world.

19:40.458 --> 19:43.291
I reckon maybe
I can live with that after all.

19:43.291 --> 19:45.291
Thanks anyway, Doc.

19:47.500 --> 19:49.833
-Look out!
-Look out yourself!

19:49.833 --> 19:52.083
How do you fly without wings?

19:52.083 --> 19:54.083
I don't know. I just do.

19:54.083 --> 19:55.208
You're lucky.

19:56.083 --> 19:57.458
Yeah. Lucky.

20:00.458 --> 20:02.583
-[Archangel] Dr. Adler.
-HerrWorthington!

20:02.583 --> 20:06.458
I came here to warn you, Doctor.
But it looks like I'm too late.

20:06.458 --> 20:09.125
Why did you not tell me
you are a mutant?

20:09.125 --> 20:11.583
Why do you think I've supported
your research?

20:11.583 --> 20:13.625
You wish to be changed?

20:13.625 --> 20:15.125
Is the treatment ready?

20:16.208 --> 20:17.625
[Adler] Apocalypse.

20:18.375 --> 20:19.625
Apocalypse!

20:21.458 --> 20:24.583
I've found another mutant
to become your slave.

20:24.583 --> 20:28.333
The millionaire,
Warren Worthington,

20:29.416 --> 20:31.958
with the wings of an angel.

20:31.958 --> 20:34.166
How did you know
he was a mutant?

20:34.166 --> 20:39.333
I know more of this world
than you have even dreamed.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.083
That is why I must destroy it.
