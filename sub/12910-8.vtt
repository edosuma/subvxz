01:17.104 --> 01:21.544
Genny, all right?

01:22.384 --> 01:28.024
--I have not slept in two days.
--Do you still have jet lag?

01:30.584 --> 01:33.904
It is nerves.

01:54.464 --> 01:58.504
--All right?
He's in top form.

01:58.584 --> 02:02.144
My darling ...

02:03.224 --> 02:08.904
You're thin as a model.

02:08.984 --> 02:13.704
Getting down to work.
Come on, boys.

02:13.784 --> 02:19.744
--So we eat something together one evening.
--We all go away.

02:21.504 --> 02:24.664
I'm glad to see you.

02:26.024 --> 02:29.104
What?
--You came here three days ago.

02:29.184 --> 02:33.824
And showing you now?
--I would relax a little.

02:33.904 --> 02:36.904
Shall we go for a ride?

02:36.984 --> 02:41.544
I must get hold of a pair of
guys. I must do something.

02:41.624 --> 02:44.704
Is there something wrong?
--No.

02:44.784 --> 02:49.104
--Good. See you, Ciro.
--Genna ...

02:51.384 --> 02:56.384
I have been placed
among these fucking junkies.

02:56.464 --> 02:59.984
It is not for me.

03:01.144 --> 03:07.384
--We need to talk. Do you hear?
--See you, Ciro.

03:40.824 --> 03:44.504
Hi, Genna. Where have you been?

03:44.584 --> 03:49.784
--We need to talk.
--We take a stroke. Long time no see.

03:49.864 --> 03:53.784
Throw that shit away.
I want to talk, I said.

03:53.864 --> 04:00.704
--What do you say?
--Can all of you not to go outside? Thank you.

04:04.384 --> 04:07.224
It may be important.

04:07.304 --> 04:12.464
You must make up
as mayoral candidate in Giugliano.

04:12.544 --> 04:16.624
No problem.
I can also be president.

04:17.704 --> 04:21.184
What the hell are you laughing at? What?

04:21.824 --> 04:26.464
--You mean it.
--Fabbretti is an old asshole.

04:26.544 --> 04:29.904
We need young people like you.

04:29.984 --> 04:35.344
But Fabbretti all behind him.
We have always supported him.

04:35.424 --> 04:41.024
What kind of man are you?
Have you no dignity?

04:41.104 --> 04:47.384
I got 900 votes to
municipal elections. Fabbretti was 30,000.

04:47.464 --> 04:53.824
It'll be embarrassing.
--Not with me. Do you understand?

04:53.904 --> 04:56.664
Look at me.

04:57.824 --> 05:03.104
You are good enough.
Everybody likes you in Giugliano.

05:03.184 --> 05:10.184
Tomorrow we're printing your posters.
We make a list of all the young people.

05:10.944 --> 05:17.864
Then we find those who can provide
votes. You have to reach in.

05:17.944 --> 05:24.064
--Do I have a choice, Genna?
What do you think?

05:24.144 --> 05:28.904
--We are making an effort.
It's not an experiment.

05:28.984 --> 05:34.304
I will make you mayor,
but you have to believe it.

05:34.384 --> 05:39.784
I believe that tomorrow.
Now I'll take a line.

05:42.104 --> 05:45.144
Hey, Miche.
Hey, Genny.

05:45.224 --> 05:48.544
Come on, let's go.

06:29.384 --> 06:32.544
Quietly, I do not wanna hear it.

06:32.624 --> 06:37.144
If we're talking, it ends up wrong.

06:37.224 --> 06:40.584
No, now we're talking.

06:40.664 --> 06:44.424
What's wrong?

06:46.744 --> 06:51.064
--Do you think that I have taken your place?
--Shut up.

07:08.184 --> 07:13.944
Shall we order deep for everyone?
We'll have to wait for donna Imma.

07:14.024 --> 07:18.664
We are not waiting for anyone.
You can talk to me.

07:18.744 --> 07:22.184
Hurry,
I have other things to do.

07:22.264 --> 07:29.544
Then we started. With goods from
Honduras, we control the market now.

07:29.624 --> 07:32.864
We thank you for your work.

07:32.944 --> 07:37.184
Genna, is that you?
It is ten years ago.

07:37.264 --> 07:42.024
--How are you, Mino?
--I came out two weeks ago.

07:42.104 --> 07:46.664
I work as a dishwasher.
You may be able to help me?

07:46.744 --> 07:52.384
--I am busy. We take it later.
--We went to the same school.

07:52.464 --> 07:58.664
You were called "pepper"
for you were thick and blushed.

07:58.744 --> 08:02.864
--Do you remember that?
--Yes, I can.

08:03.424 --> 08:07.944
But I have to do something.
I'll call you later.

08:08.024 --> 08:10.344
Okay.

08:12.344 --> 08:16.304
--Where did we come from?
--You have invited Ciro.

08:16.384 --> 08:20.624
He has not been
so much with the large trades.

08:20.704 --> 08:26.984
But he is one of your best friends.
He should be more of.

08:32.384 --> 08:37.344
Have you asked
one of your friends plead your case?

08:37.424 --> 08:44.104
Genna. We have much experience.
It has been on the street.

08:44.183 --> 08:49.384
--We grew up with your father.
--We should focus on what's important.

08:51.624 --> 08:58.464
There are choices in Giugliano.
While building a transport center.

08:58.544 --> 09:01.704
We're covered. Fabbretti's.

09:01.784 --> 09:07.544
500 cold stores, movie theater, bowling.
In addition, a police station.

09:07.624 --> 09:12.344
A train station. 6,000 jobs to us.

09:12.424 --> 09:16.584
We get a share.
Fabbretti have always supported us.

09:16.664 --> 09:21.624
I will not share more, Zecchinetta.
I want it all.

09:21.704 --> 09:27.144
Do you think that it's just us?
Everyone should have food on the table.

09:30.184 --> 09:33.864
I have paid.

09:37.064 --> 09:41.424
--Come, Mino.
--This is going to hell ...

09:48.864 --> 09:55.504
What the hell are you doing?
--What do we do with him?

09:55.584 --> 09:58.784
Take this.

10:03.744 --> 10:09.184
Are you all right, Ciro?
Do it properly.

10:13.264 --> 10:16.944
He's not crazy.

10:17.904 --> 10:20.904
Come on, let s go.

10:22.384 --> 10:27.344
--Genna! Genna!
--Wait.

10:29.904 --> 10:35.744
This is our moment
but you treat me like shit.

10:35.824 --> 10:42.064
Have you forgotten what I've done
for you? We are brothers.

10:42.144 --> 10:46.784
I have not forgotten it.
But we're not brothers.

10:46.864 --> 10:50.184
I am Pietro's son, I take over.

10:50.264 --> 10:54.384
It is clear.
But I will work with you.

10:54.464 --> 10:59.424
No, Ciro.
So it will be business as usual.

10:59.504 --> 11:04.544
I have to prove to the others,
I can handle it myself.

11:04.624 --> 11:09.664
Beware.
If you go solo, it will be your death.

11:09.744 --> 11:15.664
Maybe. Do not be angry, CirÃ¹.
It's my turn now.

11:32.744 --> 11:36.984
We have 3,000 flyers and 500 posters.

11:38.384 --> 11:42.384
Tonight, put
posters throughout Giugliano.

11:42.464 --> 11:48.424
Share you up. I do not see
Fabbrettis face longer.

11:49.904 --> 11:53.504
Give me two boxes.

11:55.064 --> 11:59.664
--Where do we start?
--This is my neighborhood.

11:59.744 --> 12:05.344
--Empire, communists, students.
--What are our options?

12:05.424 --> 12:11.144
--Rings.
--Then we have something to do.

12:11.224 --> 12:14.504
Get started.

12:27.624 --> 12:30.624
Hey, Daniele.
Hey.

12:52.224 --> 12:54.664
Hey, Ciro.
--Head?

12:54.744 --> 13:00.544
--He's not here yet.
--Can I park it with you?

13:00.624 --> 13:06.984
--I do best Triumph.
--It does not run.

13:09.624 --> 13:14.824
--It must be the spark.
--Check it carefully.

13:14.904 --> 13:19.304
--I hope it is in good hands.
--That's it.

13:19.384 --> 13:23.544
Hey, Daniele.
--See you.

13:46.464 --> 13:50.864
--Who is he?
--Gaetano Salemi, builder.

13:50.944 --> 13:54.024
He has not worked in two years.

13:54.104 --> 13:58.224
If they are angry, it is good for us.

13:58.304 --> 14:04.504
Fabbretti gave me a promise.
I'll get 3,000 votes.

14:04.584 --> 14:08.984
And we all share contracts.

14:09.064 --> 14:13.184
Equally? The devil either.

14:13.264 --> 14:18.224
--Why are we here.
--Do you endorse my candidacy?

14:18.304 --> 14:24.584
Back up? I support no. I'm
been taken in the ass too many times.

14:24.664 --> 14:29.864
--We give you our word of honor.
--Parole? What do you mean? Honor?

14:29.944 --> 14:33.944
I have not earned a damn thing for two years.

14:34.024 --> 14:39.224
--Do you understand the transport center ...
--It will not happen.

14:39.304 --> 14:44.904
Yes, it does.
When we win, it's ours and yours.

14:44.984 --> 14:48.824
--I do everything for you.
And going against Fabbretti?

14:48.904 --> 14:55.384
We are all against. If we win,
we will have it all to ourselves.

15:01.424 --> 15:04.864
No, you will not be enough.

15:04.944 --> 15:10.744
<i> Hug him! Hug the idiot. To here </ i></i>

15:30.384 --> 15:34.264
I was bitten by a dog. Watch.

15:35.184 --> 15:37.904
I have disinfected it.

15:37.984 --> 15:43.384
Put a little iodine.
It does not look infected out.

15:43.464 --> 15:46.944
Yes?

15:48.064 --> 15:53.224
--You also set up to the election.
--Yes.

15:53.304 --> 15:56.424
I support Michele Casillo.

15:56.504 --> 16:01.464
Last you got 7,000 preference votes
Those I could use.

16:01.544 --> 16:06.664
I have served the municipality for ten years,
but not on your side.

16:06.744 --> 16:10.544
the lists are
not published yet.

16:10.624 --> 16:16.984
--There is always a place for you.
--You are wasting your time.

16:17.904 --> 16:24.104
You're a good person.
I am not here to make friends.

16:24.184 --> 16:29.984
We must stand together against all those
which is destroying our city.

16:30.064 --> 16:35.504
We can not make alliances.
--What alliances?

16:40.024 --> 16:45.144
Is there still
alliances today?

16:47.624 --> 16:54.024
I must be honest. I know
who you are and where you belong.

17:06.223 --> 17:12.743
If the wound was deeper, would
have reached the ulna and radius.

17:18.064 --> 17:21.784
I am not a trained doctor.

17:24.584 --> 17:28.344
But I know a few things.

17:28.424 --> 17:33.264
There is room for you
bottom of my list. Do you understand?

17:33.344 --> 17:36.664
Good job.

17:49.544 --> 17:53.184
They all do it ...

17:53.264 --> 17:58.224
Hey.
Hey.

17:58.304 --> 18:01.704
--Is your name Gessica.
--How do you know?

18:01.784 --> 18:05.464
A mutual acquaintance. I am Genny.

18:05.544 --> 18:08.944
--Are you from Giugliano?
--No.

18:09.024 --> 18:12.144
--What do you want?
--Say that you are beautiful.

18:12.224 --> 18:14.664
--Get out.
--Wait.

18:14.744 --> 18:17.864
--Are you here tomorrow?
Why?

18:17.944 --> 18:22.184
I'm coming,
maybe we can go for a ride.

18:22.264 --> 18:26.744
--We shall see. Hey.
Hey.

18:28.944 --> 18:32.104
Trak, you will have smoke or pot?

18:32.184 --> 18:35.904
--Can I see?
Pot is best.

18:35.984 --> 18:42.384
What are you smoking?
Is that marijuana?

18:42.464 --> 18:45.624
You can not believe a damn thing.

18:45.704 --> 18:49.664
--Have you made ??money?
Can you reach the ground?

18:49.744 --> 18:52.944
Beautiful motorcycle.

18:53.024 --> 18:56.264
Who belongs to it?
--Ciro.

18:56.344 --> 19:00.144
By Ciro, you run around
on his motorcycle?

19:00.224 --> 19:05.304
I made the spark.
Now try I run it.

19:05.384 --> 19:10.064
--Get off.
No, stop now.

19:10.144 --> 19:13.024
Shut up.

19:13.104 --> 19:16.784
You stay here. Now it is our.

19:16.864 --> 19:19.664
You stay here.

19:31.184 --> 19:34.904
Be a good boy.

19:35.584 --> 19:39.224
Stay there and shut up.

19:46.824 --> 19:49.984
It ends wrong.

20:11.064 --> 20:14.384
--Hello.
--Hello.

20:15.384 --> 20:18.744
I have signatures with.

20:18.824 --> 20:23.304
--500 Signatures?
--850 As a precaution.

20:23.384 --> 20:26.464
Let me go.

20:26.544 --> 20:31.224
What are you doing you idiot?
--Stay away.

20:31.304 --> 20:35.664
--Do you have your own list?
--Stay away from me.

20:35.744 --> 20:39.264
I'll get at you.

20:51.344 --> 20:56.224
Genna,
Fabbretti took the signatures.

21:09.464 --> 21:13.224
Must I do everything myself?

21:49.344 --> 21:54.384
What's going on?
You must make an appointment.

21:54.464 --> 22:00.344
--Gennaro Savastano. Give me the list.
Yes, I support Casillo.

22:00.424 --> 22:04.544
--Can I talk to Mom?
--You talking to me.

22:04.624 --> 22:11.664
It's a miracle that your friend
sitting in council.

22:11.744 --> 22:15.064
Get out now.

22:17.184 --> 22:22.144
Give me the signatures.
--What are you doing?

22:22.224 --> 22:25.344
What's it gonna be?

22:46.664 --> 22:49.944
The crashed.

22:50.464 --> 22:53.104
Drove wrong?

22:53.184 --> 22:56.584
How did it happen?

22:58.744 --> 23:04.184
That's my fault. I was out yesterday.
I'm doing it. Give me two days.

23:07.624 --> 23:12.744
You're funny. Capaebomba
told what happened.

23:12.824 --> 23:15.904
"It crashed."

23:27.784 --> 23:32.024
I am looking for someone I can trust.

23:32.104 --> 23:35.344
One who is skilled.

23:36.144 --> 23:39.624
I need a courier.

23:40.664 --> 23:45.584
You can drive around town
in goods.

23:45.664 --> 23:52.144
If you do it well ...
Like the motorcycle?

23:52.224 --> 23:54.864
Then you get it.

23:57.024 --> 24:00.304
What do you say?

24:00.384 --> 24:03.584
--Do you want it?
--Yes.

24:06.504 --> 24:11.104
--Can I trust you?
--Yes, you can.

24:14.504 --> 24:19.384
--I have to go now. Hey.
--See you.

24:30.184 --> 24:33.864
--I have to go.
--Wait ...

24:41.104 --> 24:45.664
--Gessica.
--I have to go now.

24:51.624 --> 24:54.424
Good night.

24:56.984 --> 25:00.904
--Kl. is 1
--I know, Dad ...

25:00.984 --> 25:05.784
Do not be hard on her, doctor.
It's our first date.

25:05.864 --> 25:09.944
It was my fault. Good night.

26:04.384 --> 26:08.824
Hey, Gennaro.
--Good evening.

26:10.544 --> 26:15.784
Why do you mess with that?
Is not it better to Fabbretti?

26:15.864 --> 26:22.904
--Has the mayor done something wrong?
--Michele Casillo is younger, more.

26:22.984 --> 26:27.624
I am secretary
Ministry of Transport.

26:27.704 --> 26:32.024
We will transport center
because of me.

26:32.104 --> 26:36.264
If you need anything,
then come to me.

26:36.344 --> 26:41.504
You do not need Mayor Square
to get what you want.

26:41.584 --> 26:47.784
Are you saying you do me a favor?

26:48.264 --> 26:51.904
You have Dad to thank for your job.

26:51.984 --> 26:55.344
Does your father know what you're doing?

26:55.424 --> 27:01.384
Father sitting in isolation.
Now it's me who decides.

27:01.464 --> 27:06.944
Listen. I do not care
with Giuglianos Mayor space.

27:07.024 --> 27:11.024
People have asked me,
to get you to reconsider.

27:11.104 --> 27:16.104
You get people against you, which has
worked side by side with your father.

27:16.184 --> 27:19.584
Reliable people who like you.

27:19.664 --> 27:23.864
I understand that.
You are young and want to change things.

27:23.944 --> 27:26.624
You ...

27:26.704 --> 27:32.344
I should shoot you in the mouth,
because you're wasting my time.

27:32.424 --> 27:35.344
Do you understand that?

29:15.984 --> 29:19.184
What is it?

29:21.104 --> 29:24.704
--Nothing.
--Sure?

29:43.504 --> 29:48.104
--I'll call you later.
--Do you?

29:57.824 --> 30:01.104
I have to go. Hey.

30:04.784 --> 30:08.184
Hello, doctor.

30:10.864 --> 30:14.784
What are you doing? What do you want me?

30:15.824 --> 30:21.544
I do not know what people are saying about
my family, but they are envious.

30:21.624 --> 30:28.304
I actually like Gessica.
All I can say.

30:28.384 --> 30:31.184
Have a nice day.

30:52.464 --> 30:57.904
If a customer will patronize me
he must walk 500 meters.

30:57.984 --> 31:04.464
--So he is acting in the supermarket.
--I know you have lost many customers.

31:06.304 --> 31:08.624
Excuse me.

31:17.264 --> 31:21.024
Shop--owners are with us.
It's not enough.

31:21.104 --> 31:25.664
What do you mean?
We have assembled with us.

31:25.744 --> 31:30.424
St. Stephen's association is with us.
Tomorrow I'm talking to the sports hall.

31:30.504 --> 31:36.384
Fabbretti got 64% of votes. We must
have them. Even those on the left.

31:36.464 --> 31:42.984
--Left? That's 24 votes?
--It's not funny.

31:43.064 --> 31:46.504
If we lose, it's all over.

31:46.584 --> 31:49.984
--I do my best.
It's not enough.

31:50.064 --> 31:55.624
--You go from door to door, you hear?
--Yes.

31:55.944 --> 32:00.984
--Come on.
-- "Come on."

32:38.704 --> 32:43.064
I hold an election dinner
with important people.

32:43.144 --> 32:47.224
--Do you see instead?
--I do not want anything from you.

32:47.304 --> 32:52.624
--You have done enough damage.
What do you mean?

32:52.704 --> 32:56.104
What the hell have I done to you?

32:56.184 --> 32:59.704
You do not know?
Then I will tell it.

32:59.784 --> 33:06.304
In Honduras, I sat in a cabin with
an American who chattered away.

33:06.384 --> 33:11.024
Your money did not come.
One evening I got a machete.

33:11.104 --> 33:14.464
They shouted, "Kill him."

33:14.544 --> 33:20.744
I prayed that you would rescue
me. But no one came.

33:20.824 --> 33:26.464
They screamed:
"Kill him, otherwise we will kill you."

33:26.544 --> 33:30.344
So I did it.
I chopped off his head.

33:30.424 --> 33:34.224
Then his arm, then his hand.

33:34.304 --> 33:39.304
I chopped him to pieces.
Do you understand now?

33:43.184 --> 33:47.304
Otherwise, you just continue
together with Ciro.

33:47.384 --> 33:52.264
I sent you there
for you to learn something.

33:52.344 --> 33:58.824
It seems that it worked.
Am I right?

34:26.304 --> 34:32.103
2,000. Maybe.
That's what I can do.

34:33.664 --> 34:36.984
I do not understand. Explain.

34:37.063 --> 34:41.984
I do not do. I try
to give you my vote--

34:42.063 --> 34:47.944
--if possible. But promise me
to stop seeing my daughter.

34:48.024 --> 34:53.384
--You really do not like me, huh?
--I have no opinion about you.

34:53.464 --> 34:58.144
It's my offer.
Do you accept it or not?

35:01.424 --> 35:07.904
And then they call us bad people.
--Tomorrow I'll call the patients.

35:07.984 --> 35:11.864
Remove your hand from the throat.

35:14.864 --> 35:19.144
Talk to you,
when the polling stations closed.

35:19.224 --> 35:21.824
Smut.

35:56.624 --> 35:59.664
There he is. Hurry.

36:04.624 --> 36:08.104
Are you choice the President?

36:08.184 --> 36:10.944
--Hello.
--Listen.

36:11.024 --> 36:16.824
First election night Leaning out of
toilet window and receive a blank tag.

36:16.904 --> 36:19.104
Hallo.

36:20.784 --> 36:23.304
Turn him.

36:23.384 --> 36:27.984
Did you understand what my friend said?
Did you know?

36:28.824 --> 36:34.664
--Let's move out, Capaebomba.
--Did he get it?

36:35.064 --> 36:38.144
Go, go.

36:46.224 --> 36:48.624
--Champagne?
--Yes.

36:48.704 --> 36:53.144
Sorry, I'll talk
with the other guests.

36:55.224 --> 36:58.184
Gennaro.

36:58.264 --> 37:03.224
The brothers Maturano.
They know all.

37:04.184 --> 37:07.624
If you want, I can go there.

37:07.704 --> 37:12.824
No, why? Come on.

38:30.024 --> 38:34.184
Good. Back to work.

38:50.424 --> 38:53.624
I lead in the polls.

38:53.704 --> 38:56.984
Thanks, I disappoint them. Hey.

38:57.064 --> 39:00.864
Candidates must not be
polling station.

39:00.944 --> 39:04.624
--We must suppose though.
--Go now.

39:04.704 --> 39:10.384
--Why are you doing such a fuss?
--You should not be here.

39:10.464 --> 39:13.704
Go now.

39:17.424 --> 39:21.744
I understand your plan now.
You were right.

39:21.824 --> 39:27.864
You show that you can handle it yourself.
They will respect you.

39:27.944 --> 39:32.304
But remember that I am your best friend.

39:32.384 --> 39:37.624
I'm always on your side
also if you lose.

39:42.024 --> 39:46.664
I do not lose. Do you understand that?

40:18.504 --> 40:20.584
