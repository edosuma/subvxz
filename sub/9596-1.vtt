00:00.594 --> 00:04.231
_

00:04.733 --> 00:06.790
How can you believe in
something you can't see?

00:07.067 --> 00:08.668
I mean, like they say, seeing is believing.

00:09.337 --> 00:13.788
_

00:14.274 --> 00:16.676
We bought what we thought was
gonna be our dream home,

00:16.710 --> 00:17.843
our forever home.

00:20.614 --> 00:24.517
I'm not one to scare easily,
but something was in there.

00:24.551 --> 00:25.618
Who you talking to?

00:25.652 --> 00:26.786
My friend.

00:26.820 --> 00:28.047
Maybe we had a ghost.

00:28.989 --> 00:29.989
What does your friend say?

00:33.093 --> 00:34.093
He's going to hurt you.

00:34.127 --> 00:37.263
But why would a ghost want to hurt me?

00:37.867 --> 00:41.505
_

00:47.574 --> 00:50.476
I saw all these satanic symbols.

00:50.510 --> 00:51.477
What is this stuff for?

00:51.511 --> 00:52.712
You okay?

00:52.746 --> 00:54.447
In plain sight that night...

00:54.481 --> 00:57.950
I witnessed something I
never thought I'd witness.

00:57.984 --> 01:00.686
I just kept thinking, "what to do now?

01:00.721 --> 01:01.921
How far is this gonna go?"

01:30.951 --> 01:32.251
Are you guys excited?

01:32.285 --> 01:34.186
We were staying at my parents' house,

01:34.221 --> 01:38.424
saving up money to be able to
go out and buy the dream home.

01:38.458 --> 01:39.825
Here we go, guys.

01:39.990 --> 01:43.058
The house was getting crowded
with two grown boys.

01:43.093 --> 01:46.795
It was time to get out, you
know, live on our own.

01:46.830 --> 01:49.064
And we finally found a place

01:49.099 --> 01:50.666
that we thought we were gonna call home.

01:50.700 --> 01:52.568
Attabud.

01:52.602 --> 01:53.903
We finally had enough money

01:53.937 --> 01:55.905
to be able to put down on a house

01:55.939 --> 01:58.307
we wanted to make our forever home.

01:58.341 --> 02:00.109
The kids told us that they loved it.

02:00.143 --> 02:01.343
All right. Come on.

02:01.378 --> 02:03.212
My oldest son, gage,
he's big into football.

02:03.246 --> 02:04.513
See inside?

02:04.547 --> 02:07.416
And Hunter is whatever big brother does.

02:07.450 --> 02:08.417
Want to see?

02:08.451 --> 02:09.884
When we spotted this home,

02:09.919 --> 02:12.421
the real estate agent told us
that it was a foreclosed home,

02:12.455 --> 02:13.656
that's why the price was cheap.

02:13.690 --> 02:15.357
Hey, hey, be careful.

02:15.392 --> 02:16.392
Let 'em explore.

02:16.426 --> 02:18.761
It was, you know, a lot cheaper.

02:18.795 --> 02:20.195
You get good deals on foreclosures,

02:20.230 --> 02:24.199
especially if they, like, needed fixing up.

02:24.234 --> 02:26.602
It was spacious...

02:26.636 --> 02:28.771
And a great floor plan.

02:31.741 --> 02:33.976
It just seemed like too good to be true.

02:41.084 --> 02:44.720
I went ahead and purchased
a camper trailer.

02:44.754 --> 02:48.057
I put it in the front yard.

02:48.091 --> 02:49.725
Thirsty?

02:49.759 --> 02:51.060
Heck yeah.

02:51.094 --> 02:52.461
And I figured we could live in it,

02:52.495 --> 02:56.765
and when I got off of work,
I could work on the house.

02:56.800 --> 02:58.334
We couldn't wait to get
all the work done...

02:58.368 --> 02:59.668
Thanks.

02:59.703 --> 03:02.004
And... to our big home...

03:02.038 --> 03:03.872
And live in it finally.

03:03.907 --> 03:06.675
Living in a camper was cramped.

03:06.710 --> 03:07.977
Oh!

03:08.011 --> 03:09.011
Whoa. Careful.

03:09.045 --> 03:10.813
But we finally had our own place.

03:20.890 --> 03:22.458
I was in the kitchen.

03:22.492 --> 03:26.295
No one's around. I'm home by myself.

03:26.329 --> 03:27.863
I wanted to get some painting done.

03:27.897 --> 03:29.431
Turned the radio on.

03:30.767 --> 03:32.701
I walked into the room next to the kitchen

03:32.736 --> 03:35.537
and started painting in the room

03:35.572 --> 03:38.874
and, you know, started
painting a little wall.

03:40.310 --> 03:41.443
Listening to the music.

03:43.246 --> 03:45.914
And then all of a sudden,
it just shuts off.

03:49.085 --> 03:50.386
Hello?

03:50.420 --> 03:54.390
I knew I was home alone.

03:54.424 --> 03:55.657
So I went to the kitchen.

04:05.668 --> 04:07.870
Nobody's there.

04:11.374 --> 04:14.009
So I went and looked at it,

04:14.044 --> 04:16.845
checked it was plugged in still.

04:16.880 --> 04:19.180
And it's a push-button.

04:19.214 --> 04:21.016
So for it to be pushed off,

04:21.051 --> 04:22.551
something would've had to push it off,

04:22.585 --> 04:25.187
and no one's around to push it off.

04:32.896 --> 04:36.432
Didn't really know what it was,
so I went back to painting.

04:56.419 --> 04:58.687
All of a sudden, same thing... shuts off.

05:04.427 --> 05:05.661
So I call out.

05:05.695 --> 05:06.795
Hello?

05:08.631 --> 05:10.666
Nobody answers me.

05:10.700 --> 05:13.869
So I'm... you know, I'm nervous as can be.

05:15.872 --> 05:18.540
I have a heart condition.

05:18.575 --> 05:19.875
And I need to take lots of medicine.

05:19.909 --> 05:21.844
My heart will start beating

05:21.878 --> 05:23.512
and then just all of a sudden drop down.

05:23.546 --> 05:26.715
I'll just pass out.

05:26.749 --> 05:29.852
I'm the last person in the
world that should be scared,

05:29.886 --> 05:33.989
'cause if I get scared
too bad, I could die.

05:39.162 --> 05:41.296
So I go back to the kitchen.

05:51.074 --> 05:52.040
What is happening here?

05:52.075 --> 05:53.675
Am I going crazy?

05:55.912 --> 05:57.479
So I went to go get my medicine.

06:08.424 --> 06:10.092
I just brushed it off.

06:10.126 --> 06:12.027
Let's just forget about
that that even happened.

06:12.061 --> 06:13.996
Let's just pretend it didn't even happen.

06:16.199 --> 06:18.667
Been there about a month.

06:18.701 --> 06:23.005
My son gage wanted to have his
birthday party at the house.

06:23.039 --> 06:26.074
She wanted to get the
inside decorated for him.

06:26.109 --> 06:29.178
We're decorating with all
kind of birthday stuff.

06:29.212 --> 06:30.179
And I realize...

06:30.213 --> 06:31.180
Soda.

06:31.214 --> 06:32.181
What?

06:32.215 --> 06:34.149
I forgot the soda.

06:34.184 --> 06:35.217
They'll be here any minute.

06:35.251 --> 06:36.218
I got to go to the store.

06:36.252 --> 06:37.920
"Y'all go run to the store,

06:37.954 --> 06:39.454
"and I'll stay here.

06:39.489 --> 06:42.191
Y'all get what you got to get,
and I'll keep decorating."

06:42.225 --> 06:45.060
- Thank you, mama.
- Okay, honey.

06:59.576 --> 07:02.678
I just started feeling like,

07:02.712 --> 07:04.179
for some reason...

07:07.183 --> 07:11.720
Something was right there watching me.

07:11.754 --> 07:14.456
I'd hear little noises.

07:15.825 --> 07:17.626
And I just kept looking
back, and I'm thinking,

07:17.660 --> 07:18.627
"stop this. Stop this."

07:18.661 --> 07:19.761
I'm telling myself,

07:19.796 --> 07:21.763
"just stop this."

07:21.798 --> 07:24.833
Barely just... not enough
noise to say that,

07:24.867 --> 07:26.602
"oh, it was something definite."

07:26.636 --> 07:27.603
It wasn't.

07:29.105 --> 07:31.240
It just... it got worse.

07:34.043 --> 07:36.678
Something was right there behind me.

07:42.752 --> 07:44.453
I just had to get out of there.

07:50.026 --> 07:52.561
I'm not one to scare easy,
but something was in there.

07:56.399 --> 07:59.768
When we came back, my mom was
standing in the front yard.

08:01.571 --> 08:02.604
She seemed kind of nervous.

08:02.639 --> 08:04.439
I knew something happened.

08:04.474 --> 08:05.641
I don't know.

08:05.675 --> 08:08.310
There's something in that house.

08:08.344 --> 08:12.080
I've never seen her... never
seen her that scared.

08:12.115 --> 08:14.116
Just never.

08:20.056 --> 08:21.623
And then I went inside the house...

08:31.601 --> 08:33.802
Looked around.

09:05.735 --> 09:06.935
No one's there.

09:13.176 --> 09:14.142
Hey.

09:14.177 --> 09:15.477
Oh, my god.

09:18.348 --> 09:19.314
What's the matter?

09:19.349 --> 09:21.817
You scared me.

09:21.851 --> 09:23.485
I was telling him about what happened.

09:23.519 --> 09:27.656
Oh, mama said she heard something.

09:27.690 --> 09:29.324
And he... you know, he brushed it off.

09:29.359 --> 09:30.692
- That's your mama.
- Little, you know...

09:30.727 --> 09:32.060
And I was like, "oh, that's your mama.

09:32.095 --> 09:33.228
"She watches too many movies.

09:33.262 --> 09:35.330
She watches all that ghost stuff on TV."

09:35.365 --> 09:36.631
Yeah.

09:36.666 --> 09:38.667
I tell him about how she
would never be this scared.

09:38.701 --> 09:40.001
And he's like, "oh, no, you know,

09:40.036 --> 09:41.336
y'all are overreacting."

09:41.371 --> 09:43.472
- Come on.
- Yeah.

09:47.377 --> 09:49.311
Do you like the decorations? Mmhmm.

10:00.390 --> 10:02.858
There was still a lot of remodeling to do,

10:02.892 --> 10:05.794
but I still have to deal with the chores.

10:05.828 --> 10:09.064
You know, work got to be done.

10:11.234 --> 10:14.169
I went into the house,
started doing dishes.

10:23.045 --> 10:25.213
And I just felt this...

10:27.583 --> 10:31.052
Icy, icy breeze on my neck

10:31.087 --> 10:35.891
and looked aroun

10:35.925 --> 10:37.025
hello?

10:40.596 --> 10:41.563
No one's there.

10:41.597 --> 10:42.998
I'm home by myself.

10:43.032 --> 10:46.535
AJ's at work; The kids are
at my parents' house.

10:46.569 --> 10:48.670
I'm completely alone.

10:48.704 --> 10:50.539
I went back to doing the dishes.

10:59.115 --> 11:01.550
And then I felt something poke me.

11:02.819 --> 11:06.688
Spun around, dropped the dish.

11:06.722 --> 11:07.823
Hello?

11:09.559 --> 11:10.659
If I got too worked up

11:10.693 --> 11:12.527
and, you know, didn't have medicine,

11:12.562 --> 11:13.995
you know, I could just pass out.

11:15.731 --> 11:17.265
My heart was racing...

11:17.300 --> 11:19.468
Felt like it was gonna
jump out of my chest.

11:21.904 --> 11:24.005
I kind of froze for a second.

11:24.040 --> 11:26.274
No one's there.

11:26.309 --> 11:27.442
All of a sudden...

11:31.247 --> 11:32.314
Yank...

11:33.516 --> 11:34.483
Grabbed my ponytail.

11:36.252 --> 11:38.653
I had to go get out of that house.

11:44.594 --> 11:45.894
My chest was so tight, I
coul[Gngrely breathe.

11:45.928 --> 11:48.630
And I realize I don't have my medicine.

11:50.266 --> 11:53.635
It's all in the house.

11:53.669 --> 11:57.305
I don't want to go back in there.

11:57.340 --> 11:59.474
But I have to get to my medicine.

12:04.814 --> 12:05.747
I have to go get it.

12:14.385 --> 12:17.910
_

12:20.105 --> 12:23.978
_

12:24.142 --> 12:25.809
I don't have my medicine.

12:30.916 --> 12:33.264
I have to go get it.

12:34.386 --> 12:37.121
So I ran in there...

12:43.824 --> 12:45.925
Grabbed it off the counter in the kitchen,

12:45.960 --> 12:47.927
and ran straight back out.

12:54.769 --> 12:58.071
I took the medicine.

12:58.105 --> 13:03.042
The whole time, I'm
thinking, "what is this?

13:03.077 --> 13:04.043
"What is going on?

13:04.078 --> 13:05.178
Am I going crazy?"

13:06.447 --> 13:07.580
"I don't know.

13:07.615 --> 13:09.215
Something is not right."

13:13.487 --> 13:14.888
Later that evening...

13:14.922 --> 13:16.055
Hi, hon.

13:16.090 --> 13:17.257
AJ came home from work.

13:17.291 --> 13:19.092
I sat him down.

13:19.126 --> 13:22.862
I told him, "something
wrong with this house.

13:22.897 --> 13:24.931
"I don't know what's going on,

13:24.965 --> 13:26.800
but there is something here."

13:26.834 --> 13:28.101
Baby, it's all right.

13:28.135 --> 13:29.702
- He told me...
- I'm sure you're right.

13:29.737 --> 13:31.070
"It's just me."

13:31.105 --> 13:33.606
Who's shy in a big old house to herself?

13:33.641 --> 13:38.044
She's home alone in a house
that she ain't used to.

13:38.078 --> 13:39.379
I didn't think there was nothing.

13:40.981 --> 13:42.615
All right. Yeah.

13:42.650 --> 13:44.250
Come on. Let's go to bed.

13:44.285 --> 13:47.453
So I figured, "maybe he's right.

13:47.488 --> 13:50.190
"Maybe there's some other reason

13:50.224 --> 13:52.025
all these things are happening."

14:01.769 --> 14:02.902
A couple days later,

14:02.937 --> 14:05.738
I was in the house folding clothes.

14:05.773 --> 14:08.474
Hunter was in the front room playing.

14:08.509 --> 14:11.744
Right. All black.

14:11.779 --> 14:13.446
I heard him talking.

14:13.480 --> 14:16.382
I don't...

14:16.417 --> 14:18.918
Want to.

14:18.953 --> 14:22.088
I knew gage wasn't in there.

14:22.122 --> 14:26.426
I could see him playing on the back porch.

14:30.965 --> 14:35.268
So I stopped what I was doing,

14:35.612 --> 14:36.879
walked in there.

14:38.615 --> 14:41.250
I don't know.

14:47.291 --> 14:51.260
You're scaring me.

14:52.562 --> 14:53.929
Yes.

14:53.963 --> 14:56.332
Sounded like he was having a
conversation with someone.

15:00.070 --> 15:02.037
I forget them.

15:02.072 --> 15:03.372
Yes.

15:06.409 --> 15:08.243
Yes.

15:10.947 --> 15:13.649
Wait.

15:13.683 --> 15:15.017
No.

15:21.758 --> 15:23.025
I don't see anybody.

15:24.994 --> 15:27.896
I'm like, "Hunter, who are you talking to?"

15:27.931 --> 15:30.366
My friend.

15:30.400 --> 15:31.667
"My friend."

15:35.271 --> 15:37.840
"Hunter, I don't see anybody."

15:37.874 --> 15:42.010
But I'm talking to my friend.

15:42.045 --> 15:43.212
"I'm talking to my friend."

15:43.246 --> 15:45.681
I say, "well, what does your friend say?"

15:51.454 --> 15:54.456
I have to be his friend,
or he's going to hurt you.

16:06.106 --> 16:07.973
Hey, come on.

16:08.008 --> 16:10.209
Let's go outside, all right?

16:10.243 --> 16:12.378
I tried to brush it off,

16:12.412 --> 16:13.946
and I was trying to cover up

16:13.980 --> 16:16.682
how nervous and scared I
was about the situation.

16:20.086 --> 16:21.720
It was getting cold.

16:21.755 --> 16:23.322
I needed to get the boys' winter clothes,

16:23.356 --> 16:24.857
and they were in the attic of the house.

16:24.891 --> 16:27.560
AJ was working, so I called my dad.

16:27.594 --> 16:29.695
So he came over to come help me.

16:29.729 --> 16:31.897
Doing all right. I just...

16:31.932 --> 16:33.699
When Jeanine told me, you know,

16:33.733 --> 16:35.501
what was going on in the house,

16:35.535 --> 16:39.238
being a skeptic like I am, I
got to see it to believe it.

16:39.272 --> 16:40.573
- You know, it's...
- Calm down.

16:40.607 --> 16:42.241
You let 'em come find me.

16:42.275 --> 16:43.576
Her heart condition right now,

16:43.610 --> 16:46.412
she needs to take it as easy as possible.

16:46.446 --> 16:47.813
Don't be getting scared

16:47.848 --> 16:51.169
or any kind of nervousness.

16:51.498 --> 16:53.866
I was too scared to go in the attic.

16:53.901 --> 16:57.304
And my dad also said, "no,
you're not going in the attic."

17:00.108 --> 17:03.577
My dad's coming down from the steps.

17:03.611 --> 17:05.278
When he gets down to the
bottom of the steps,

17:05.313 --> 17:10.317
he saw the rosary on the door behind me...

17:17.558 --> 17:19.425
Just swinging.

17:19.460 --> 17:22.362
Back and forth, back and forth constantly.

17:29.904 --> 17:31.738
Just stopped.

17:37.478 --> 17:39.980
Daddy, don't.

17:40.014 --> 17:42.415
And then all of a sudden, you hear it.

17:44.685 --> 17:45.652
Boom.

17:47.989 --> 17:49.923
Like something was thrown down.

17:55.630 --> 17:56.897
Daddy.

17:58.132 --> 18:01.368
Like it's stomping over in the attic,

18:01.402 --> 18:02.969
and this thing is hitting hard.

18:05.273 --> 18:07.374
Boom, boom, boom!

18:07.408 --> 18:09.743
I started screaming at this thing...

18:09.777 --> 18:11.344
"Show yourself."

18:13.181 --> 18:14.147
Show us where youse at!

18:14.182 --> 18:16.082
I really got furious with it.

18:16.117 --> 18:17.184
Show yourself, damn it!

18:18.586 --> 18:20.253
I was scratched.

18:20.288 --> 18:21.488
I was clawed.

18:21.522 --> 18:23.557
Checked my back.

18:23.591 --> 18:25.826
Started feeling like I was being burned

18:25.860 --> 18:28.094
from the inside out.

18:29.964 --> 18:32.098
Three claw marks, and you could see 'em.

18:32.133 --> 18:36.002
Deep, bleeding scratches all
the way across my back.

18:43.548 --> 18:45.216
Show yourself, damn it!

18:47.252 --> 18:50.664
_

18:53.249 --> 18:55.316
It hurt so bad.

18:55.351 --> 18:57.965
And there's no way to explain it.

18:59.088 --> 19:01.057
Something wanted to hurt me bad.

19:04.026 --> 19:06.261
It totally blew my mind.

19:06.295 --> 19:07.829
And that's when I really
started getting worried

19:07.863 --> 19:10.832
about my grandkids and
her and AJ living there.

19:10.866 --> 19:14.669
When AJ came home, I was
trying to get myself together.

19:14.704 --> 19:16.204
Don't... I don't want to scare my kids.

19:16.238 --> 19:17.539
- Hey, y'all.
- You guys ready?

19:17.573 --> 19:19.007
I didn't want them to know anything.

19:19.041 --> 19:20.275
What you boys doing up?

19:20.309 --> 19:22.343
They're gonna stay with mommy and daddy...

19:22.378 --> 19:24.345
I wanted to tell him about what happened.

19:24.380 --> 19:27.515
There is something there, and
it's something that is evil,

19:27.550 --> 19:29.451
and it's not something to play with.

19:29.485 --> 19:30.618
Jeff.

19:30.653 --> 19:32.287
- From being...
- You two need to talk.

19:32.321 --> 19:33.288
A skeptic like I was,

19:33.322 --> 19:34.889
I'm not a skeptic anymore.

19:39.695 --> 19:41.229
So we went up to the house.

19:41.263 --> 19:43.198
And then all of a sudden,
there was booming...

19:43.232 --> 19:46.367
I told AJ, "I'm terrified."

19:46.402 --> 19:48.136
I showed him the claw marks on my back.

19:48.170 --> 19:49.771
And look.

19:49.805 --> 19:51.172
Oh, baby, how...

19:51.207 --> 19:53.475
She showed me three distinct
red lines across her back.

19:53.509 --> 19:55.043
I don't know.

19:55.077 --> 19:57.045
There was... there was nothing there.

19:57.079 --> 20:00.381
He didn't believe what I
was saying was happening.

20:00.416 --> 20:02.751
You know, you might have just
rubbed up against a rusty nail

20:02.785 --> 20:04.052
or some screws in the wall or something.

20:04.086 --> 20:05.587
I was like, "well, yeah,
there's plenty of things

20:05.621 --> 20:06.821
"in the house to scratch you.

20:06.856 --> 20:09.357
"You could have brushed
up against a door frame

20:09.391 --> 20:11.059
that was already nailed in."

20:11.093 --> 20:13.228
I really didn't think too much of it.

20:13.262 --> 20:14.229
And we talking.

20:14.263 --> 20:15.563
I just don't...

20:28.944 --> 20:30.211
It just slammed shut

20:30.246 --> 20:32.247
like somebody just grabbed
it and slammed it shut

20:32.281 --> 20:34.349
as hard as you could possibly slam a door.

20:40.456 --> 20:42.056
I go to open the door.

20:54.737 --> 20:56.504
In plain sight that night,

20:56.539 --> 20:58.173
I witnessed something I
never thought I'd witness:

20:58.207 --> 21:01.476
A door opening up and
slamming shut on its own.

21:01.510 --> 21:07.215
Terrifying as it was, at
least it validated what...

21:07.249 --> 21:10.351
What was been happening all along to me.

21:14.256 --> 21:16.391
I thought hanging some religious items

21:16.425 --> 21:18.560
around the house might help some.

21:18.594 --> 21:19.594
It might calm it down,

21:19.628 --> 21:22.897
might make whatever feel at ease.

21:22.932 --> 21:23.965
We figured it had to help.

21:23.999 --> 21:25.900
Back door.

21:25.935 --> 21:27.335
I went out by the back door.

21:30.272 --> 21:34.742
I dropped my Bible down
on the kitchen table.

21:34.777 --> 21:37.378
I nailed the crucifix up by the back door.

21:41.450 --> 21:42.984
And as soon as I stepped off the ladder...

21:44.954 --> 21:46.588
All the lights went off in the kitchen.

21:46.622 --> 21:48.756
Pitch-black.

21:48.791 --> 21:50.925
That's when I really
started getting scared.

21:55.731 --> 21:57.966
Something was, like,
making a crackling noise.

21:58.000 --> 22:00.168
We look over at the Bible...

22:05.888 --> 22:07.422
Wham, it just slams shut.

22:10.493 --> 22:13.195
We just rushed out of the house.

22:13.229 --> 22:15.530
We had to get out of there.

22:22.405 --> 22:23.872
I didn't have no answer for it.

22:23.906 --> 22:26.708
Nothing that I could process
in my mind what I just saw

22:26.743 --> 22:31.613
besides some kind of spiritual
presence in the house.

22:36.919 --> 22:39.655
I just kept thinking,

22:39.689 --> 22:42.190
"what to do now?

22:42.225 --> 22:43.625
How far is this gonna go?"

22:45.128 --> 22:46.728
We figured maybe if I found

22:46.763 --> 22:49.431
some kind of evidence
with the tape recorder,

22:49.465 --> 22:53.402
we can find out what this thing is

22:53.436 --> 22:56.004
and then maybe be able to find someone

22:56.039 --> 22:58.340
to help us get rid of it...

22:58.374 --> 22:59.775
Somehow.

23:04.047 --> 23:06.081
I didn't want to go in the house on my own,

23:06.115 --> 23:07.349
but I was just so desperate.

23:07.383 --> 23:14.521
I just wanted some proof.

23:14.555 --> 23:17.524
Took a deep breath.

23:17.558 --> 23:19.225
Ran in.

23:19.260 --> 23:22.195
Dropped it on the kitchen table.

23:22.229 --> 23:23.563
Ran right back out.

23:39.413 --> 23:42.882
It was about 30 minutes later.

23:42.917 --> 23:43.883
Boys!

23:43.918 --> 23:47.554
I need you in the camper, please.

23:47.588 --> 23:49.689
Okay, just stay in there for now, okay?

23:54.161 --> 23:55.395
I ran in,

23:55.429 --> 23:58.364
grabbed it, and ran right
back out to the porch.

24:03.037 --> 24:06.272
I rewound the tape.

24:06.307 --> 24:08.575
I got it to the beginning,

24:08.609 --> 24:09.576
pushed play.

24:10.744 --> 24:11.744
Listened for a little while.

24:13.380 --> 24:16.182
Didn't hear anything.

24:16.217 --> 24:17.617
Fast-forward a little bit.

24:17.651 --> 24:18.618
Pushed play.

24:20.554 --> 24:23.022
Didn't hear anything.

24:23.057 --> 24:24.424
Fast-forward a little bit more.

24:24.458 --> 24:25.425
Pushed play.

24:29.563 --> 24:30.864
All of a sudden, heard something.

24:33.534 --> 24:34.634
I heard growling.

24:37.404 --> 24:40.540
And then all of a sudden,
you hear this voice said...

24:44.578 --> 24:46.012
"She will die."

24:48.916 --> 24:52.585
You hear this evil, scary voice.

24:54.088 --> 24:55.655
This is what it wants from me.

24:55.689 --> 24:56.789
It wants to kill me.

25:05.341 --> 25:08.536
_

25:10.353 --> 25:12.353
_

25:12.369 --> 25:13.603
"She will die."

25:13.637 --> 25:15.938
I had thoughts in my head
maybe we had a ghost.

25:15.973 --> 25:20.510
But why would a ghost want to hurt anybody,

25:20.544 --> 25:21.844
especially me?

25:21.879 --> 25:23.913
And I have kids.

25:28.385 --> 25:31.487
We saved up for years,
finally had our own home,

25:31.522 --> 25:34.357
and we couldn't even live in it.

25:34.391 --> 25:36.125
Everything we had was sunk here.

25:36.159 --> 25:37.360
We're stuck.

25:39.062 --> 25:42.832
About a week after, while
I'm doing the laundry...

25:42.866 --> 25:44.133
Okay, boys, don't run too far.

25:44.167 --> 25:47.703
Dinner will be ready soon. All right?

25:47.738 --> 25:50.206
My worst fear that it was
gonna come after the kids.

25:50.240 --> 25:54.010
So the house was strictly
off-limits to them.

26:07.057 --> 26:08.124
It just went quiet.

26:15.532 --> 26:19.669
I heard my kids inside the house.

26:19.703 --> 26:20.836
I started to panic.

26:22.539 --> 26:24.407
I could hear them playing.

26:28.712 --> 26:29.979
Boys!

26:33.050 --> 26:35.685
I didn't want to have to go in there...

26:43.160 --> 26:46.362
But I heard them upstairs.

27:06.183 --> 27:07.149
I hollered at 'em.

27:07.184 --> 27:09.285
Boys, get down here right now.

27:20.664 --> 27:24.433
I could hear 'em playing
upstairs, laughing.

27:24.468 --> 27:25.801
And they know not to be up there.

27:25.836 --> 27:28.938
I just ran straight in there,

27:28.972 --> 27:30.239
up the stairs to get 'em.

27:32.709 --> 27:35.511
And then when I got to
the top of the stairs,

27:35.545 --> 27:37.146
it just went quiet.

28:00.671 --> 28:01.971
Where are my kids

28:02.005 --> 28:04.306
if they're not up here?

28:07.678 --> 28:08.811
The gut-wrenching feeling of

28:08.845 --> 28:11.647
"something may happen to my kids"

28:11.682 --> 28:12.782
was terrifying.

28:23.627 --> 28:25.561
So I turned around.

28:27.731 --> 28:29.031
And then, bam,

28:29.066 --> 28:32.554
I just felt like I ran
straight into a brick wall.

28:41.545 --> 28:44.413
I felt something just push me down.

28:45.549 --> 28:46.782
Held me down.

28:46.817 --> 28:48.784
I couldn't get up.

28:50.387 --> 28:54.123
I felt like a ton of bricks
had just been dropped on me.

28:54.157 --> 28:56.625
The scariest moment ever in my life.

29:18.381 --> 29:19.949
Something had its hands on me.

29:41.265 --> 29:42.766
There was no getting up.

29:42.800 --> 29:46.503
I struggled with everything I had.

29:46.537 --> 29:49.272
Something said... the demonic voice...

29:49.307 --> 29:51.675
Look under.

29:52.877 --> 29:54.978
"Look under."

29:55.012 --> 29:57.180
Under.

29:57.214 --> 30:00.850
I noticed a piece of the
carpet was kind of peeled up.

30:00.885 --> 30:02.018
Help!

30:02.053 --> 30:05.288
Look under.

30:05.323 --> 30:06.556
Under.

30:09.427 --> 30:11.861
I pulled back the carpet.

30:11.896 --> 30:15.765
I see these satanic looking crazy symbols,

30:15.800 --> 30:17.067
darted out of there.

30:17.101 --> 30:18.768
I stumbled a little bit trying
to get down the stairs,

30:18.803 --> 30:20.036
but I got down there.

30:20.072 --> 30:22.073
I see AJ. Are they okay?

30:22.106 --> 30:25.642
And I'm so relieved that he has the kids.

30:25.676 --> 30:27.544
Go get your mommy's pills.

30:27.578 --> 30:28.878
I can barely breathe,

30:28.913 --> 30:29.946
and he's asking me what's going on.

30:29.981 --> 30:31.047
There's something upstairs.

30:31.082 --> 30:32.949
Says "upstairs." I rush up to the house.

30:32.984 --> 30:34.517
Rush up the stairs.

30:37.688 --> 30:40.724
And I see that the corner of
the carpet's been pulled back.

30:40.758 --> 30:44.227
And I see some symbols on the floor:

30:44.261 --> 30:45.895
A star and a pentagram.

30:45.930 --> 30:48.031
And as I pulled back more,

30:48.065 --> 30:52.268
it had more and more
symbols coming exposed.

31:19.609 --> 31:24.554
_

31:28.145 --> 31:29.879
I was just blown away.

31:29.913 --> 31:31.714
Who can do something like this?

31:31.749 --> 31:34.050
Who can bring such evil in a house?

31:34.085 --> 31:36.319
Why would somebody put
all this on the floor?

31:38.088 --> 31:40.656
Why did we never look under
the carpet in the first place

31:40.691 --> 31:42.892
when we bought the house?

31:42.927 --> 31:46.629
Why did it take this thing to show us that?

31:46.664 --> 31:50.467
What sick person would write this?

31:50.501 --> 31:53.336
What is this stuff for?

31:53.370 --> 31:54.738
We needed help desperately.

31:55.873 --> 31:58.975
So I called the only person I knew.

31:59.009 --> 32:01.811
It was pretty late when
the minister got there.

32:01.846 --> 32:04.214
I felt like this was our
last chance as a family

32:04.248 --> 32:07.250
to finally get rid of this out
of the house, cast it out.

32:11.521 --> 32:13.088
When he walked in, he said, "yes, there"...

32:13.124 --> 32:14.924
Definitely is a presence here.

32:14.959 --> 32:16.459
He told us he was gonna do a deliverance.

32:16.494 --> 32:17.827
We'll say a prayer together.

32:17.862 --> 32:21.631
I'm going to anoint the windows, the doors.

32:21.665 --> 32:24.750
And then started going through the house

32:26.842 --> 32:27.876
cleansing it.

32:34.684 --> 32:36.818
We went and followed him,
just kind of, you know,

32:36.852 --> 32:39.054
watching what was going on,
trying to take it all in.

32:41.958 --> 32:45.493
I'm thinking the whole time,
"yeah, yeah, we winning.

32:45.528 --> 32:47.529
This is working."

32:47.562 --> 32:51.966
I started to feel terrible, sick.

32:52.001 --> 32:53.268
She was acting kind of funny.

32:53.302 --> 32:55.003
- You okay?
- She wasn't being herself.

32:57.306 --> 33:00.775
Oh, yeah, I'm just... feel lightheaded.

33:00.810 --> 33:02.177
That's all.

33:02.211 --> 33:04.779
All of a sudden...

33:04.814 --> 33:06.915
Whoa. Oh.

33:06.949 --> 33:09.184
I felt like... I felt like I was out of it.

33:09.218 --> 33:11.286
Come on. All right.

33:11.320 --> 33:13.288
She was slurring her words.

33:13.322 --> 33:15.123
She was cold.

33:16.225 --> 33:17.859
I think we need to seat her down.

33:17.893 --> 33:19.127
Yeah.

33:19.161 --> 33:22.297
I mentioned something doesn't feel right.

33:22.331 --> 33:24.966
So they thought maybe I was
just feeling sick again.

33:25.001 --> 33:26.768
All right, you sit here.

33:31.674 --> 33:35.503
I got to go help the minister.

33:35.537 --> 33:37.672
Oh, don't go.

33:37.706 --> 33:39.507
I'm just gonna be right up there.

33:39.541 --> 33:41.642
Okay? You holler if you need me.

33:52.820 --> 33:56.156
I could feel the negative energy

33:56.191 --> 33:57.525
surrounding me.

34:03.232 --> 34:05.733
My chest was so tight,

34:05.767 --> 34:07.101
I could barely breathe.

34:50.579 --> 34:52.580
I felt like I was out of it.

34:52.614 --> 34:54.181
I wasn't even me anymore.

35:03.491 --> 35:06.459
After that, I don't remember too much more.

35:09.831 --> 35:11.532
After about a hour

35:11.566 --> 35:13.467
of him going through the house blessing it,

35:13.502 --> 35:15.403
he said, "it's gone.

35:15.437 --> 35:17.471
It's over with."

35:28.183 --> 35:29.417
I thanked him.

35:29.451 --> 35:30.484
You know, we shook hands,

35:30.519 --> 35:32.820
said our good-byes,

35:32.854 --> 35:34.488
and he left.

35:34.523 --> 35:35.723
And the whole time,

35:35.757 --> 35:37.758
Jeanine was kind of just
sitting in the chair.

35:48.537 --> 35:49.603
Jeanine?

36:26.174 --> 36:27.808
Honey?

36:27.843 --> 36:29.043
You okay?

36:30.946 --> 36:31.979
Hey.

36:32.014 --> 36:35.649
Hey. You all right?

36:35.684 --> 36:37.818
Okay, I'm gonna take you to mama's place.

36:37.853 --> 36:39.153
Let's go.

36:39.187 --> 36:40.287
Come on.

36:41.990 --> 36:43.324
There you are.

36:43.358 --> 36:46.160
I'm exhausted. I'm glad
everything's over with.

36:46.194 --> 36:48.796
Jeanine was real worn-out
tired from the whole thing,

36:48.830 --> 36:50.231
so I helped her to the car.

36:53.568 --> 36:55.403
We were heading back to her mother's house.

36:56.638 --> 36:58.606
It's really early in the morning.

37:02.477 --> 37:04.011
You know, it's just us on the road,

37:04.046 --> 37:05.112
and it's real dark.

37:05.147 --> 37:08.616
How you feeling, baby?

37:08.650 --> 37:09.784
She was laid back.

37:09.817 --> 37:10.950
You okay?

37:10.986 --> 37:12.853
And I was like, "hey, baby, how you doing?"

37:12.888 --> 37:14.088
You feeling better?"

37:18.326 --> 37:19.560
She says...

37:19.594 --> 37:21.395
I'm fine.

37:22.831 --> 37:25.132
With a deep voice that wasn't hers.

37:25.167 --> 37:26.634
So I looked at her eyes.

37:26.668 --> 37:29.470
They were pitch-black.

37:29.504 --> 37:32.573
Turns her head back around
and faces straight forward.

37:35.176 --> 37:37.043
So I put my foot down on the pedal

37:37.079 --> 37:39.914
because I had to try to get her
back to her parents' house

37:39.948 --> 37:43.217
as quick as possible.

37:43.251 --> 37:44.785
When we pulled up to her parents' house,

37:44.820 --> 37:46.120
they were waiting up for us.

37:46.154 --> 37:50.157
So me and her dad carried her inside.

37:50.192 --> 37:51.759
I checked her pulse,

37:51.793 --> 37:53.594
and she had a good pulse,

37:53.628 --> 37:57.398
but she was real, real ice-cold.

37:57.432 --> 37:59.233
I said, "Jeanine, what is the matter?"

37:59.267 --> 38:01.602
What's the matter, honey?

38:01.635 --> 38:02.936
"What is the matter, Jeanine?"

38:02.971 --> 38:05.823
And she was staring at me.

38:07.352 --> 38:09.777
Black eyes just staring straight at me.

38:09.811 --> 38:11.579
And she just said...

38:11.613 --> 38:14.782
I'm fine.

38:14.816 --> 38:15.883
Well, it was a voice

38:15.917 --> 38:17.918
I've never heard out of Jeanine before.

38:17.953 --> 38:20.121
A deep, angry voice.

38:20.155 --> 38:22.389
Just whatever got in her
was not my daughter.

38:22.424 --> 38:23.724
We got to get her to the hospital.

38:23.758 --> 38:25.392
There's something really
wrong with Jeanine.

38:25.426 --> 38:26.793
Something's gonna happen to her.

38:26.828 --> 38:28.262
They're not gonna even
know what to do with her.

38:28.296 --> 38:29.630
Gonna put... they're
gonna think she's nuts.

38:29.664 --> 38:31.132
Calm down, Beverly.

38:31.166 --> 38:32.733
They're not gonna believe us.

38:32.767 --> 38:34.034
The hospital's not gonna help.

38:34.069 --> 38:36.170
We need a minister. He's on his way.

38:36.204 --> 38:38.339
I thought she was dying on
me right in front of me.

38:38.373 --> 38:41.308
There was nothing else
we could do but pray.

38:41.343 --> 38:42.743
She goes find a family Bible.

38:42.777 --> 38:44.578
"The Lord is my strength."

38:44.612 --> 38:45.912
Just started reading prayers.

38:45.946 --> 38:49.048
"My salvation.

38:49.083 --> 38:50.250
The Lord is my strength."

38:50.284 --> 38:52.085
It didn't have no effect.

38:52.119 --> 38:53.586
Keep going. Keep going.

38:53.621 --> 38:56.089
"The voice of rejoicing and salvation

38:56.123 --> 38:58.925
"is in the tabernacles of the righteous.

38:58.959 --> 38:59.926
Then it was"...

39:04.298 --> 39:07.667
It's in me.

39:07.701 --> 39:09.235
She said, "it's in me."

39:09.270 --> 39:10.303
What do you mean, honey?

39:10.337 --> 39:12.772
It's in me.

39:21.478 --> 39:25.271
_

39:25.404 --> 39:27.038
We waited for the minister to arrive.

39:27.072 --> 39:28.239
It seemed like hours.

39:37.683 --> 39:38.883
He knew it was in her.

39:38.917 --> 39:40.251
He just knew it.

39:40.285 --> 39:42.220
I'm gonna need your help.

39:42.254 --> 39:44.756
"I need each one of y'all grab
an arm and hold her down."

39:48.928 --> 39:51.063
AJ held her; I held her.

40:01.440 --> 40:04.475
Her head started bouncing
back and forth, side to side.

40:18.957 --> 40:21.058
And it was just getting...
Like, it was getting pissed.

40:25.330 --> 40:26.831
She got real strong.

40:28.534 --> 40:31.169
We trying to hold her still,
and we just got to keep going.

40:34.206 --> 40:35.606
You got to hold her down!

40:35.641 --> 40:36.741
Come on!

40:47.286 --> 40:49.387
Over the top of her forehead,

40:49.421 --> 40:51.722
he made the sign of the cross.

40:51.757 --> 40:52.890
And this thing,

40:52.925 --> 40:55.560
in a real deep, angry voice, said...

40:55.594 --> 40:57.728
Leave us alone.

40:57.763 --> 40:59.597
This was the scariest situation

40:59.631 --> 41:02.099
I ever seen in my life.

41:02.134 --> 41:03.267
Start calling her!

41:03.302 --> 41:05.036
He said, "start calling for Jeanine."

41:05.070 --> 41:06.103
Jeanine!

41:06.139 --> 41:07.573
Me and AJ bring her back.

41:07.606 --> 41:08.806
Come back!

41:10.476 --> 41:11.442
Jeanine! Come on!

41:12.644 --> 41:15.146
Come on!

41:20.052 --> 41:21.152
Keep saying her name,

41:21.186 --> 41:23.287
telling her she got to fight it, be strong.

41:27.793 --> 41:29.727
I can hear people saying, "Jeanine.

41:29.761 --> 41:30.728
Wake up"...

41:30.762 --> 41:31.796
Come on out, Jeanine.

41:31.830 --> 41:33.698
Come back to us.

41:33.732 --> 41:36.267
We kept working it and
working it and working it.

41:36.301 --> 41:37.935
Jeanine! Come on!

41:37.970 --> 41:39.937
And then praying over me.

41:42.975 --> 41:44.909
You got to fight! Now, fight it!

41:44.943 --> 41:46.210
Come on, Jeanine.

41:47.412 --> 41:51.349
And I was trying the hardest to fight.

41:56.088 --> 42:01.058
The blackness dissipated,
and there was light.

42:01.093 --> 42:03.661
She popped her eyes open.

42:03.695 --> 42:05.396
It was her eyes.

42:05.430 --> 42:06.564
It was gone.

42:09.768 --> 42:13.671
She snapped out of it. She just went limp.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.239
I was relieved I had my wife back.

42:15.274 --> 42:18.409
I thought it was all over with finally.

42:18.443 --> 42:21.045
Since that happened, we
got out of the house,

42:21.079 --> 42:22.346
pulled the camper away.

42:22.381 --> 42:24.115
We've been staying in her sister's backyard

42:24.149 --> 42:26.617
ever since then.

42:26.652 --> 42:28.819
We bought what we thought was
gonna be our forever home.

42:28.854 --> 42:32.924
The dream home became a nightmare.

42:32.958 --> 42:34.926
Still to this day,

42:34.960 --> 42:37.094
I'm constantly thinking about it.

42:37.129 --> 42:38.696
It's always in the back of my mind.

42:38.729 --> 42:40.397
What if this thing comes back?

42:42.410 --> 42:46.797
