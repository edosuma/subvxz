00:13.416 --> 00:16.125
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder.

00:16.791 --> 00:18.500
Sounds simple enough, right?

00:19.208 --> 00:22.125
Except when what we behold
has been manipulated.

00:30.458 --> 00:32.791
Since Black people first hit these shores,

00:32.875 --> 00:37.333
we've been programmed to value
one standard of beauty above all others.

00:37.416 --> 00:42.541
During the 1780s, German historian
Christoph Meiners peddled the idea

00:42.625 --> 00:45.125
that mankind was split into two divisions,

00:45.208 --> 00:49.333
the beautiful white race,
and the ugly Black race.

00:50.750 --> 00:54.375
Let's just say,
not everyone agrees with that theory.

01:00.500 --> 01:04.541
I'm telling you,
I've been to the eye doctor,

01:04.625 --> 01:07.166
I've ran my errands, and my stew is ready.

01:08.000 --> 01:11.958
This slow cooker will change your life.

01:13.375 --> 01:14.208
Okay.

01:15.750 --> 01:19.833
Yeah, I gotta go
'cause my kid comes home ravenous.

01:21.833 --> 01:24.125
I haven't heard a word about it.

01:24.791 --> 01:25.875
Mm.

01:26.458 --> 01:32.125
Rick, Donna said that, uh,
Reece is going to the Homecoming Dance.

01:32.208 --> 01:34.583
Do you know if Colin's planning to go?

01:34.666 --> 01:36.583
No? Yeah. No.

01:37.041 --> 01:40.750
Uh, we don't know.
Colin's not a big talker.

01:40.833 --> 01:42.000
-Oh.

01:42.708 --> 01:46.333
He's here. I'll get it out of him. Bye.

01:48.416 --> 01:49.708
-What's up?
-Hey.

01:51.375 --> 01:53.083
-How was your day?
-All right.

01:56.750 --> 01:57.791
What?

01:57.875 --> 02:01.500
Go, find out if he's going
to the Homecoming Dance.

02:02.000 --> 02:04.750
Okay. Encourage him
'cause it'll be good for him.

02:04.833 --> 02:07.291
Maybe it'll take his mind off of things.

02:15.041 --> 02:16.166
Just chilling out?

02:24.916 --> 02:29.041
Have you given any thought
to going to the Homecoming Dance?

02:31.916 --> 02:32.750
No.

02:33.625 --> 02:38.375
Um, you mean, no, like, you're not going,
or no, you haven't thought about it?

02:39.666 --> 02:45.250
No. I haven't really thought about it.
I got my mind on other things.

02:45.333 --> 02:46.375
Sure.

02:46.458 --> 02:50.958
Your brother and sister went.
Not together. They had dates.

02:53.916 --> 02:57.500
I bet there's tons of girls
that would love to go with you.

02:57.583 --> 03:00.208
Not just 'cause you're an athlete.
You're a nice guy.

03:02.458 --> 03:03.916
She's pretty, huh?

03:04.458 --> 03:07.375
She's the one Bruce Springsteen
hand-picked to be in his video.

03:08.791 --> 03:09.708
Meh.

03:09.791 --> 03:13.000
Just, uh, what is your type?

03:39.583 --> 03:42.083
-Y'all think she's cute?
-Hell yeah.

03:42.166 --> 03:45.375
But I don't like athletic girls,
they're too tall. And too confident.

03:45.458 --> 03:46.625
You sound dumb.

03:46.708 --> 03:48.250
Y'all going to Homecoming?

03:48.333 --> 03:50.000
I'm sorry, do we look corny to you?

03:50.583 --> 03:52.666
Dances are for busters,
and I ain't no buster.

03:52.750 --> 03:53.750
I'm taking my girl.

03:54.750 --> 03:57.958
I rest my case.
Why you asking? Wait, you too?

03:58.541 --> 04:00.166
Busters, both of y'all.

04:04.208 --> 04:09.125
Hey. I saw your leg cramp up
on you earlier. I felt so bad for you.

04:09.916 --> 04:13.583
Heh. It really wasn't all that bad,
but thank you.

04:13.666 --> 04:17.833
You know, I'm, like,
crazy good at leg massages.

04:19.375 --> 04:20.500
Cool.

04:21.625 --> 04:23.708
-Thank you.
-Yeah. Yeah.

04:24.833 --> 04:26.458
-I'll let you know.
-Okay.

04:31.708 --> 04:33.375
Wait, hold up, hold up.

04:33.875 --> 04:36.541
So you got one of the
baddest girls in school jockin' you,

04:37.041 --> 04:39.166
and you checkin' for crispy Crystal?

04:39.666 --> 04:43.541
Nah, she was just sittin' over there,
and I was just, like, "Yo, what's up?"

04:43.625 --> 04:47.083
You know, she was checkin' me out.
I was just, like, "What's up, you know?"

04:47.166 --> 04:49.333
And she was like... you know?

04:50.500 --> 04:54.291
So you gonna take Hailey up on that offer?
'Cause if not, then I will.

04:54.375 --> 04:56.000
Like, shoot, hook me up right now.

05:13.833 --> 05:15.125
What's up, Crystal?

05:18.208 --> 05:19.458
What's up, Crystal?

05:23.583 --> 05:24.791
What's up, Crystal?

05:50.208 --> 05:53.500
Crystal.
Hey, can I talk to you for a minute?

05:53.583 --> 05:56.333
Um, kind of busy right now.
Sorry, my mom's waiting.

05:56.416 --> 05:57.875
Hold on a sec.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.208
Colin!

06:05.458 --> 06:06.458
Hey, cutie.

06:07.541 --> 06:08.666
We should hang sometime.

06:12.208 --> 06:15.541
Yeah, um, okay. We can. Sometime.

06:15.625 --> 06:17.250
Well, give me your number.

06:26.041 --> 06:26.875
See ya.

06:28.333 --> 06:30.750
I knew it. I knew you were feeling her.

06:33.208 --> 06:35.541
Yeah. So what if I am?

06:35.625 --> 06:39.500
Look, I don't get it.
You know, Hailey's a dime. Crystal's a...

06:41.541 --> 06:42.708
Hailey's a dime.

06:42.791 --> 06:45.833
-Shut up.
-What? I didn't even say nothin'.

06:45.916 --> 06:47.166
You kind of did, though.

06:47.250 --> 06:51.375
Look, okay, I'm just saying.
You got Hailey, and you got Crystal.

06:51.875 --> 06:54.041
If it was up to me,
I know which one I'd pick.

06:54.791 --> 06:57.500
Bro, her mom's car is on life support.

06:58.291 --> 07:01.750
In the 1940s,
Black psychologists conducted a test

07:01.833 --> 07:04.125
to determine the psychological effects

07:04.208 --> 07:06.208
of segregation on Black kids.

07:06.708 --> 07:08.791
It's known as "the doll test."

07:09.541 --> 07:11.458
Children were shown two dolls,

07:11.541 --> 07:14.708
one Black, one white,

07:14.791 --> 07:17.583
and asked who was good or bad,

07:18.083 --> 07:19.666
pretty or ugly,

07:20.250 --> 07:22.916
and who the children
most wanted to be like.

07:23.541 --> 07:27.125
In most cases,
children chose the white doll.

07:27.750 --> 07:29.916
There are lots
of different colors for skin.

07:30.000 --> 07:34.041
I have questions for you about
these pictures of different children.

07:34.125 --> 07:35.541
After I read the question,

07:35.625 --> 07:39.833
I want you to point to the picture
that fits the story.

07:39.916 --> 07:42.875
This test has been conducted,
not just in America,

07:43.375 --> 07:45.000
but all over the world,

07:45.750 --> 07:49.333
always yielding similar results.

07:49.416 --> 07:51.083
Show me the mean child.

07:52.083 --> 07:54.041
Show me the dumb child.

07:54.958 --> 07:56.250
Show me the bad child.

07:56.333 --> 07:57.291
The mean child.

07:57.375 --> 07:59.125
The dumb child.

07:59.208 --> 08:00.875
The bad child. The ugly child.

08:00.958 --> 08:05.458
Mean child. Dumb child. Bad child.
Mean. Dumb. Mean. Dumb.

08:21.208 --> 08:22.708
You're not gonna say hi?

08:25.125 --> 08:26.000
Hi.

08:30.500 --> 08:32.000
-What?
-You tell me.

08:32.791 --> 08:34.541
You wanted to talk yesterday.

08:34.625 --> 08:35.916
That was yesterday.

08:36.416 --> 08:38.333
Oh, it's like that?

08:38.416 --> 08:41.416
Well, you didn't wanna talk to me.

08:41.500 --> 08:42.833
I wasn't prepared.

08:44.333 --> 08:45.708
I said I was busy.

08:47.375 --> 08:48.375
And now I'm not.

08:50.958 --> 08:51.958
Okay.

08:54.125 --> 08:55.041
So...

08:55.625 --> 08:56.625
Um...

08:59.791 --> 09:02.541
I wanted to-- To see...

09:03.750 --> 09:07.250
No, I wanted to-- To ask you if...

09:09.833 --> 09:13.625
you wanna go out with me sometime.

09:14.208 --> 09:15.750
You know, to get some food?

09:16.916 --> 09:18.666
Go to the movies, or...

09:21.375 --> 09:22.666
Or to Homecoming.

09:25.416 --> 09:26.708
How about all three?

09:31.875 --> 09:33.125
All three is good.

09:34.750 --> 09:35.875
All three is good.

09:45.250 --> 09:46.208
Hey.

09:48.208 --> 09:49.958
How's school, anything new?

09:51.041 --> 09:51.958
No.

09:55.250 --> 09:56.166
Oh.

09:59.708 --> 10:02.083
-Can you sign this for me?
-What is it?

10:05.916 --> 10:09.375
The permission slip
for the Homecoming Dance.

10:09.458 --> 10:14.166
Are you going to the Homecoming Dance?
Rick, he's going to the Homecoming Dance!

10:14.250 --> 10:16.000
That is great. That's great.

10:16.083 --> 10:17.125
Now, be careful.

10:17.208 --> 10:20.291
I took your mother to the prom,
and look at us, we got three kids.

10:22.083 --> 10:24.375
-Who's the lucky girl?
-You guys don't know her.

10:24.875 --> 10:27.541
-I bet she's pretty.
-Yeah.

10:30.041 --> 10:32.250
We should meet her and her parents.

10:35.250 --> 10:36.083
No.

10:37.000 --> 10:37.833
I'm good.

10:39.166 --> 10:40.333
So can you sign it?

10:43.500 --> 10:44.333
Thanks.

10:53.958 --> 10:56.791
Got any plans this weekend?
Other than football?

10:59.458 --> 11:00.291
Nah.

11:00.375 --> 11:05.541
Oh, actually my sister's coming into town,
so I might go with her to visit her horse.

11:06.125 --> 11:07.083
You have a horse?

11:07.583 --> 11:12.000
No. No, no. I don't have a horse.
My sister has a horse.

11:12.083 --> 11:15.541
Okay, but it's a real horse?

11:16.041 --> 11:19.083
Yeah. It's not my horse.

11:20.583 --> 11:23.041
-What are you looking for?
-Cowboy boots.

11:29.375 --> 11:31.958
So, what color we wearing to the dance?

11:34.666 --> 11:36.250
-Red?
-Gold.

11:37.875 --> 11:40.041
Gold? All right.

11:40.916 --> 11:41.750
Gold.

11:43.250 --> 11:44.208
You sure?

11:44.750 --> 11:47.333
We're gonna look good. Watch.

11:47.416 --> 11:48.375
Okay.

11:51.583 --> 11:52.833
Pick you up at 5?

11:53.458 --> 11:55.208
Why can't I meet her?

11:55.291 --> 11:57.458
I love my boys...

11:58.583 --> 12:02.083
but girls let their mothers in.

12:04.166 --> 12:05.916
Like when Devon got her tattoo?

12:06.416 --> 12:07.375
Oh, God.

12:08.500 --> 12:10.125
The tattoo!

12:10.208 --> 12:12.666
I could have died.

12:12.750 --> 12:13.791
Mm.

12:13.875 --> 12:16.583
Colin would never.

12:22.750 --> 12:23.583
Hello?

12:25.083 --> 12:27.291
Yep. Colin!

12:28.291 --> 12:29.500
Eddie!

12:29.583 --> 12:31.166
I got it, Mom.

12:35.541 --> 12:37.708
-Hey, what...?
-It was cool, you know?

12:38.333 --> 12:42.750
Just, you know, we sat down,
we talked, we ate some tacos.

12:43.291 --> 12:47.541
Look, I ain't mad at you, man.
Crystal, she cute, just so damn Black.

12:47.625 --> 12:50.500
So Black, her crayon color
would be Deep Space.

12:50.583 --> 12:52.666
Permission to laugh at that? Granted.

12:53.041 --> 12:54.625
What are you trying to say?

12:54.708 --> 12:59.500
Crystal's cuter than Hailey,
Brittany, Bailey, all them other girls.

13:00.083 --> 13:03.541
I don't care what anybody thinks.
She's pretty to me.

13:03.625 --> 13:06.083
Damn, Colin.
I never said she wasn't pretty.

13:06.166 --> 13:08.750
I just said
she's a little darker than everybody.

13:08.833 --> 13:13.958
She not just Black, she's blue black.
I mean, but she fine. She fine.

13:14.041 --> 13:16.500
What does that mean, blue black?

13:17.000 --> 13:19.791
I don't know, Teresa.
Hang up, hang up the phone.

13:37.666 --> 13:38.500
Hello?

13:38.583 --> 13:40.583
Hey, Crystal. It's Colin.

13:41.166 --> 13:42.958
-Hey.
-Here, talk to my mom.

13:45.083 --> 13:46.333
Hi, Colin's mom.

13:46.416 --> 13:47.541
Oh, hi there.

13:48.375 --> 13:49.375
Hold on a sec.

13:52.750 --> 13:54.000
Good night, Mom.

14:11.875 --> 14:14.583
Oh, hi, baby.

14:15.666 --> 14:18.500
Ooh, you a cute thing. Welcome.

14:19.125 --> 14:20.541
You got any uncles?

14:21.166 --> 14:25.208
Uh, no. I mean, I do, but they have wives.

14:25.875 --> 14:27.666
I don't want your uncle, baby.

14:28.458 --> 14:29.500
I'm just talking.

14:29.583 --> 14:31.916
Crystal be out soon.
Go on, take a look at things.

14:32.000 --> 14:33.375
Make yourself at home.

14:33.958 --> 14:35.250
I swear.

14:35.333 --> 14:37.166
Nice to meet you. Colin.

14:38.541 --> 14:39.416
Hi.

14:40.333 --> 14:41.333
Can I set this down?

14:43.583 --> 14:44.583
Wow.

14:46.375 --> 14:48.166
That's a lot of food.

14:48.250 --> 14:49.291
Look good, huh?

14:50.333 --> 14:51.916
Hey, baby.

14:52.583 --> 14:55.791
-Oh, I'm Crystal's mom, Sherry.
-Hi, nice to meet you.

14:56.416 --> 14:57.791
She's almost ready.

14:59.041 --> 15:00.166
Can I make you a plate?

15:00.250 --> 15:02.833
Yeah. Um, it looks great.

15:02.916 --> 15:03.958
Hey, man.

15:04.833 --> 15:07.125
-I'm Cryssie Uncle Nunu.
-Nice to meet you.

15:07.208 --> 15:10.041
-Y'all go to the same school?
-Yeah, he goes to Pitman.

15:10.541 --> 15:15.166
This young man is
a baseball, basketball, and football star.

15:15.833 --> 15:18.666
You a little baby Dave Winfield.

15:18.750 --> 15:23.250
That brother
was drafted by three major leagues.

15:23.333 --> 15:24.750
Y'all don't know about that.

15:24.833 --> 15:27.750
He got drafted by the Padres,
played for the Yankees,

15:28.416 --> 15:30.583
played for the Hawks
and the Minnesota Vikings.

15:30.666 --> 15:35.166
And he's smart too.
Oh, my niece has such good taste.

15:35.250 --> 15:38.833
-Try some of this pie.
-Thank you. Yeah. I love pumpkin pie.

15:41.000 --> 15:45.541
Bite your tongue, pumpkin pie.
It's sweet potato pie.

15:49.000 --> 15:50.416
Bless your heart.

16:10.166 --> 16:11.625
I got you something.

16:19.333 --> 16:20.500
It's pretty.

16:22.250 --> 16:25.791
We look good. Told you we'd rock the gold.

16:26.375 --> 16:27.875
You're rocking the gold.

16:28.666 --> 16:31.500
Okay, that's enough drooling
all over each other. Excuse me.

16:31.583 --> 16:34.333
Oh, my goodness, Daddy,
move them Gators out the way.

16:35.625 --> 16:37.875
Okay, babies, it's just a flash. Go ahead.

16:37.958 --> 16:39.833
Think your mama could save my plate?

16:40.416 --> 16:42.041
Okay, say cheese.

17:50.333 --> 17:52.208
-Hey.
-Hi, Mom.

17:52.708 --> 17:53.875
How was your day?

17:54.375 --> 17:57.125
-It was pretty good. How about you?
-Not bad.

18:15.458 --> 18:16.666
Oh, look.

18:18.416 --> 18:19.791
It's Colin's photos.

18:19.875 --> 18:22.291
-Ooh. Ooh.
-From the Homecoming Dance.

18:32.041 --> 18:33.166
Whoa.

18:36.083 --> 18:40.000
Wow. I'll say one thing.
Gold is her color.

18:40.083 --> 18:40.958
Yes.

18:42.625 --> 18:44.583
Yes, it is.

18:47.875 --> 18:51.166
Is this what Eddie meant by blue black?

18:54.666 --> 18:56.375
Well, I'm not gonna worry myself.

18:58.750 --> 19:00.458
You know how these kids are.

19:01.500 --> 19:06.041
It's probably just a passing phase,

19:06.125 --> 19:11.333
and Colin will be so caught up in sports,
probably forget all about her.

19:27.541 --> 19:29.125
-Hey, you.
-Hey.

19:29.208 --> 19:30.625
You get an offer yet?

19:31.625 --> 19:32.458
Not yet.

19:32.541 --> 19:35.458
Well, I'm offering to take you
to see Coach Carter this weekend.

19:35.541 --> 19:37.666
I know it's not college football, but...

19:38.208 --> 19:41.583
I got a football game tonight
and a baseball game tomorrow.

19:41.666 --> 19:42.583
Rain check?

19:43.500 --> 19:46.666
That's like ten rain checks, Colin.

19:46.750 --> 19:47.625
I'm sorry.

19:47.708 --> 19:50.458
We haven't spent any time together
since Homecoming.

19:50.541 --> 19:51.458
We will.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.125
Soon.

19:54.750 --> 19:58.791
I think next month
there's an amusement park opening up.

19:58.875 --> 20:01.166
I'll have more time,
I won't be at so many games--

20:01.250 --> 20:04.291
Kaepernick, you chatting with the ladies,
or you getting on the bus?

20:07.500 --> 20:09.000
We will. Soon.

20:12.041 --> 20:14.375
Colin, is it true what they say?

20:14.458 --> 20:17.416
The blacker the berry,
the sweeter the juice.

20:28.500 --> 20:31.083
-Hey.
-How are you?

20:31.166 --> 20:32.041
I'm cool.

20:33.375 --> 20:35.375
-How are you?
-Haven't seen these before.

20:40.333 --> 20:44.375
I got good news.
I might be able to hang out on Sunday.

20:45.291 --> 20:47.833
Can't do it. I have to work.

20:50.333 --> 20:51.416
You got a job?

20:53.791 --> 20:55.000
That's cool, yeah.

20:55.083 --> 20:58.083
Just a part-time flipping burgers thing.

20:58.833 --> 20:59.958
It's whatever.

21:01.416 --> 21:05.291
We can't seem to get our timing right.
I'll see you later, okay?

21:16.166 --> 21:18.583
I just had the best walk with Beth.

21:25.875 --> 21:26.750
You know...

21:29.208 --> 21:30.666
her daughter Lindsey...

21:31.791 --> 21:34.291
just broke up with her boyfriend
a little while ago.

21:34.750 --> 21:35.750
Mm-hm.

21:35.833 --> 21:38.125
She doesn't have a date
for the Winter Formal.

21:38.208 --> 21:39.333
I didn't know.

21:40.250 --> 21:43.625
Such a beautiful girl.

21:46.333 --> 21:48.500
Beth was wondering
who you were going with.

21:52.000 --> 21:53.041
No, Mom.

21:54.000 --> 21:56.875
We just thought
it would be a hoot if you took Lindsey.

21:57.625 --> 21:59.416
She's a cheerleader.

21:59.916 --> 22:01.750
She comes from a great family.

22:01.833 --> 22:05.458
You guys would be
the best-looking couple at the thing.

22:06.500 --> 22:07.333
Pass.

22:10.333 --> 22:11.583
All right.

22:12.875 --> 22:14.166
See you after school.

22:20.666 --> 22:22.541
You going to the Winter Formal?

22:22.625 --> 22:25.416
Oh, yeah. Ashley is making me go.

22:25.500 --> 22:28.875
She said she got us a hotel room
and stuff for an after party.

22:29.458 --> 22:30.791
-Are you going?
-Yeah.

22:31.625 --> 22:34.875
Gotta just check up with Crystal.
Haven't seen her in a hot minute.

22:34.958 --> 22:36.875
-You're taking Crystal?
-Yeah.

22:37.791 --> 22:38.708
Are you sure?

22:57.916 --> 22:59.000
For real, Colin?

22:59.666 --> 23:03.875
It's not like we were engaged.
And we haven't seen each other in weeks.

23:03.958 --> 23:05.250
What? Not true.

23:05.333 --> 23:07.875
Passing each other in the hall
doesn't count.

23:07.958 --> 23:09.750
-I've been busy.
-I know.

23:09.833 --> 23:11.583
I'm busy too, Colin.

23:12.083 --> 23:16.333
But like my momma always says,
we make time for the things we care about.

23:17.583 --> 23:20.916
So instead of waiting for you,
I'm living my life.

23:25.333 --> 23:27.708
-You going to the Winter Formal?
-We'll see.

23:27.791 --> 23:30.750
Well, you know, I was gonna go,

23:31.250 --> 23:34.041
but the girl I wanted to bring,
she dissed me.

23:35.666 --> 23:37.458
My parents are trying to set me up.

23:41.416 --> 23:42.541
You should go.

23:43.916 --> 23:44.833
We'll see.

23:54.833 --> 23:56.541
Sorry I screwed this up.

23:57.166 --> 24:00.625
-You have nothing to apologize for.
-No, no, I do.

24:01.541 --> 24:05.333
You deserve my respect.
You deserve my time.

24:33.583 --> 24:34.416
There he is.

24:34.500 --> 24:37.208
Word around town is
we're gonna forget football

24:37.291 --> 24:38.791
and take a baseball scholarship.

24:39.458 --> 24:40.291
Hmm?

24:40.875 --> 24:42.041
I think it's smart.

24:42.541 --> 24:45.541
Baseball is the more civilized game,
don't you think?

24:52.875 --> 24:54.250
Oh, my God.

24:54.333 --> 24:55.291
Oh, my word.

24:55.375 --> 24:58.166
She just takes your breath away,
doesn't she, Colin?

25:07.833 --> 25:11.750
If you have the most beautiful date,
bring her to the floor.

26:24.083 --> 26:28.458
Despite the media being saturated
with negative images of Black people,

26:29.041 --> 26:31.375
ideas about beauty are changing.

26:32.041 --> 26:35.250
In 2019, for the first time ever,

26:35.833 --> 26:39.166
all the world's major beauty queens
were Black.

26:46.958 --> 26:49.583
Maybe they didn't want us
to see our beauty,

26:49.666 --> 26:54.125
because they knew if we did,
if we controlled our own narrative,

26:54.208 --> 26:55.916
we'd be unstoppable.

27:03.541 --> 27:07.041
To me, we are the most
beautiful creatures in the world.

27:07.125 --> 27:07.958
Black people.

27:08.041 --> 27:13.166
My job is to somehow
make them curious enough

27:13.250 --> 27:17.166
or persuade them, by hook or crook,

27:17.250 --> 27:20.666
to get more aware of themselves
and where they came from,

27:20.750 --> 27:23.333
and what they are into,
and what is already there,

27:23.416 --> 27:24.791
and just to bring it out.

27:24.875 --> 27:28.541
This is what compels me to compel them.

27:28.625 --> 27:31.458
And I will do it
by whatever means necessary.
