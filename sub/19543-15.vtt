00:02.127 --> 00:05.335
Goku had been forced to fight Vegeta,

00:05.422 --> 00:08.960
who had turned into a Great Ape.

00:11.011 --> 00:14.299
What's the matter, Kakarrot?
Can't you deal with this?

00:14.390 --> 00:19.054
There ain't enough time for me
to focus to create a Genki Dama!

00:20.771 --> 00:26.061
Rats, | only need ten seconds!
Give me enough time to focus!

00:27.986 --> 00:30.898
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

00:30.989 --> 00:34.072
Dokkan Dokkan Paradise

00:34.159 --> 00:38.198
The Genki Dama bursts away

00:38.288 --> 00:41.621
Go Go Let's do it

00:42.835 --> 00:48.626
There's a wriggling, mysterious energy

00:48.716 --> 00:54.586
I won't hold back, just you watch

00:54.680 --> 01:00.550
I'll protect you with my life

01:00.644 --> 01:06.731
Turn your courage to love into strength

01:06.817 --> 01:12.733
We'll overcome crises with carry-through spirit

01:12.823 --> 01:19.991
The tougher your opponent is,
the greater the excitement

01:21.331 --> 01:24.198
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:24.293 --> 01:27.501
Dokkan Dokkan Now's our chance

01:27.588 --> 01:33.128
Whooshing along on the lucky wind

01:33.218 --> 01:36.085
Dokkan Dokkan We're in luck

01:36.180 --> 01:39.343
Dokkan Dokkan Tomorrow, as well

01:39.433 --> 01:46.475
Your soul already knows the answer

01:46.565 --> 01:50.183
Dragon Soul!

02:11.507 --> 02:13.293
T-That's it!

02:13.383 --> 02:16.250
Tenshinhan! I have to borrow your move!

02:16.345 --> 02:18.085
Taiyo-ken!!

02:24.686 --> 02:27.814
Now, while the brightness has blinded his eyes...

02:27.898 --> 02:31.265
M-My eyes! My eyes!

02:39.701 --> 02:43.660
A-All right. With this much distance...

02:50.003 --> 02:52.335
T-The Land...

02:52.422 --> 02:54.162
...the Seas...

02:54.258 --> 02:59.093
...and... all living things...

02:59.179 --> 03:06.472
Each of you, share with me just
a little bit of your genki energy!

03:06.562 --> 03:09.269
I beg you!

03:31.003 --> 03:35.212
Damn it! What an insolent thing to do!

03:37.259 --> 03:42.219
A-A little more... a little more,
and I can create a Genki Dama...

03:42.306 --> 03:46.640
W-What's he doin'?

03:55.027 --> 03:57.359
He's starting to get his sight back.

03:57.446 --> 03:59.482
Still, at this distance,

03:59.573 --> 04:03.486
I'll be able to launch my
Genki Dama before he can attack.

04:05.329 --> 04:09.368
Damn it, where are you?!

04:09.458 --> 04:11.449
Where are you?!

04:11.543 --> 04:12.919
Where did you go?!

04:13.003 --> 04:16.745
It's no use trying to escape!
I can sense your presence!

04:28.810 --> 04:30.311
The genki energy is collecting!

04:30.395 --> 04:33.603
Why, you...!

04:37.527 --> 04:40.439
He found me! Please, let there be enough time!

04:45.077 --> 04:49.787
|-|t's done! I've collected the
genki energy of the whole Earth!

04:54.920 --> 04:57.753
--All right!
--Take this!

05:06.682 --> 05:09.094
W-What was that?

05:09.184 --> 05:11.220
What happened?

05:37.212 --> 05:40.625
|-| never expected him to attack like that...

05:40.716 --> 05:43.458
l-l really misjudged things...

05:43.552 --> 05:48.296
Good grief, the Genki Dama I worked
so hard to make is now gone.

05:48.390 --> 05:50.506
Hmph, you're one tough bastard.

05:50.600 --> 05:54.434
But then, you look like you've
almost had it. I can tell.

05:55.856 --> 05:59.940
He's got me. Now, I ain't even
got a prayer of beating him.

06:00.027 --> 06:04.817
| used up nearly all of my Ki
on that Genki Dama just now.

06:14.166 --> 06:16.953
Well, what will you do now?!

06:28.805 --> 06:31.717
Goku's Ki is falling off, fast!

06:31.808 --> 06:33.548
F-Father!

06:33.643 --> 06:36.055
Hurry! We're almost there!

06:47.949 --> 06:50.986
Whoops! Sorry, sorry!

06:51.078 --> 06:55.242
Looks like I accidentally stepped
on you, crushing your leg.

06:57.417 --> 07:01.626
Well, this time, let me
accidentally crush your heart!

07:04.341 --> 07:06.377
This is the end for you, Kakarrot!

07:06.468 --> 07:11.178
Even if you come back to life again,
this planet won't be here when you do!

07:11.264 --> 07:14.927
D-Damn it, he's completely beaten me.

07:15.018 --> 07:17.760
I never imagined there'd be
such a gap in power between us.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.812
I'm glad there's someone this strong out there,

07:20.899 --> 07:26.314
but if I'm dead, it's just frustrating...

07:26.404 --> 07:30.647
Hmph, die!

07:41.503 --> 07:44.666
That's my last, parting shot...

07:46.508 --> 07:52.378
|-| ain't even got enough strength
left to blow my nose now...

07:52.472 --> 07:55.930
D-Do what you will with me...

08:01.982 --> 08:05.349
Why, you!

08:05.443 --> 08:08.059
Kakarrot, how dare you...

08:08.155 --> 08:13.024
How dare you scar my face?!

08:19.082 --> 08:22.370
I'm going to squeeze you to death!

08:37.017 --> 08:41.477
He's in a tight spot! It's no use now, he's dead!

08:42.813 --> 08:47.478
It ain't like I've abandoned you, okay?

08:47.569 --> 08:49.901
T-There's nothin' I can do, after all.

08:49.988 --> 08:52.946
Don't go holdin' it against me.

08:54.367 --> 08:57.484
Suffer good and hard, then die!

09:00.874 --> 09:03.035
We're close! They're right over there!

09:03.126 --> 09:05.162
Because of that weird ball of light,

09:05.253 --> 09:07.869
it's still this bright out,
even though it's the evening.

09:07.964 --> 09:10.296
What in the world is that thing?

09:11.509 --> 09:14.546
K-Kuririn-san! Over there!

09:18.266 --> 09:22.134
Get down, Gohan! Descend, and hide!

09:22.229 --> 09:24.345
W-What is that?

09:24.439 --> 09:26.771
Hurry, you dumbass!

09:26.858 --> 09:30.146
|-|t's those guys!

09:30.237 --> 09:33.855
It can't be! He's turned into a Great Ape!

09:35.742 --> 09:38.449
It felt like most of your bones broke just now.

09:38.536 --> 09:40.993
Does it hurt? Eh?

09:41.081 --> 09:43.618
Goku is getting killed. This is bad!

09:43.708 --> 09:45.664
--This way!
--Right!

09:49.089 --> 09:51.626
--Hey!
--Yajirobe!

09:51.716 --> 09:56.050
Hey, who d'ya think that
monster is?! It's the Saiyan!

09:56.137 --> 09:57.297
I know.

09:57.389 --> 10:00.881
There ain't no way you can go up
against that monster! Stay put!

10:00.976 --> 10:02.432
I know that, too.

10:02.519 --> 10:05.056
But if we cut off his tail, he'll go back to normal.

10:05.146 --> 10:07.273
--His tail?
--His tail?

10:07.357 --> 10:10.099
Listen, Gohan, you and Yajirobe
swing around in front of him,

10:10.193 --> 10:12.024
and draw his attention.

10:12.112 --> 10:16.071
I'll wait for an opening,
and cut off his tail from behind.

10:16.157 --> 10:19.149
Hurry! Goku is gonna die!

10:19.244 --> 10:20.905
R-Right!

10:23.081 --> 10:27.120
H-He's gotta be kiddin' me! Draw his attention?

10:27.210 --> 10:29.041
You guys might not know 'bout this,

10:29.129 --> 10:34.340
but even at his normal size,
he's still unbelievably strong!

10:34.426 --> 10:37.088
Father, don't die!

10:37.178 --> 10:43.139
Goku's Ki is all but gone!
Damn it, he's about to die!

10:53.611 --> 10:55.772
Father! Don't die!

10:59.075 --> 11:02.033
There's someone there!

11:02.120 --> 11:04.907
--Where are you?!
--Down here!

11:06.082 --> 11:08.573
Let my father go!

11:08.668 --> 11:13.913
Ho ho, this is a surprise. If it isn't Kakarrot's kid!

11:14.007 --> 11:19.422
| get it, you came here just to see
your father's last moments, huh?

11:19.512 --> 11:22.754
Good timing! He's right at the point of death.

11:22.849 --> 11:26.137
I was just about to finish him off.

11:27.854 --> 11:29.765
Kienzan!!

11:39.616 --> 11:41.857
Watch closely, now.

11:41.951 --> 11:45.864
I'm going to crush him until there's nothing left.

11:45.955 --> 11:48.412
Kuririn-san, hurry!

11:48.500 --> 11:53.995
Unfortunately, it looks like
he's already lost consciousness.

12:06.851 --> 12:09.558
l-l-lt can't be...!

12:12.524 --> 12:14.310
Did you really think I wouldn't realize

12:14.401 --> 12:16.437
that there was another one of you here?

12:16.528 --> 12:20.612
You guys seem to enjoy
worthless sentimentality, after all.

12:20.698 --> 12:23.030
I figured this kid wouldn't just
come wandering back here alone,

12:23.118 --> 12:25.609
so I was keeping an eye on the situation.

12:27.455 --> 12:32.245
Apparently, you knew about
our tails. Too bad, though.

12:34.337 --> 12:39.673
Just you wait! After I'm finished
with Kakarrot, you'll be next.

12:39.759 --> 12:44.423
D-Damn! What a freak! Even as a monster,

12:44.514 --> 12:46.721
he's still level-headed, and on guard.

12:46.808 --> 12:50.392
I'm sorry Goku. I hate to just
stand by and let you die,

12:50.478 --> 12:54.812
but this guy's Ki is too great.
I can't even get close!

12:56.860 --> 13:02.526
Your mistake was to try
to challenge me to battle!

13:02.615 --> 13:05.573
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

13:05.660 --> 13:08.026
Stop it!

13:10.290 --> 13:14.784
Oh, you want to die before your father, do you?

13:17.797 --> 13:19.708
O-Oh, no!

13:25.597 --> 13:29.681
What's the matter? Too scared to move?

13:42.864 --> 13:45.150
Leave me outta the rest of it!

13:45.241 --> 13:53.740
D-Damn it! l-l didn't know
there was another one of you!

13:56.085 --> 13:59.623
M-My tail!

14:36.876 --> 14:41.040
|-|t's cut... His tail has been cut off!

14:44.884 --> 14:48.627
You did it, Yajirobe!
He's gone back to his original size!

14:52.433 --> 14:59.225
W-Why, you miserable...!

15:02.569 --> 15:06.187
You want to die so badly, you'd make me mad?!

15:06.281 --> 15:10.115
W-What's going on? Why did that monster...?

15:10.201 --> 15:15.446
In that case, as you wish, I'll kill you, you trash!

15:25.049 --> 15:27.381
Gohan! Run!

15:35.560 --> 15:38.597
I'll start with you!

15:38.688 --> 15:41.304
A Saiyan half-breed is strong, right?!

15:41.399 --> 15:44.983
Show me your true power!

15:50.283 --> 15:54.572
Heh, maybe there's been a change in the order.

15:56.998 --> 16:01.788
Now, get up! Amuse me a little more.

16:03.963 --> 16:06.875
Hey, what is this? Is this all you've got?

16:06.966 --> 16:11.084
Does that mean the child
of scum is scum, as well?!

16:16.225 --> 16:20.434
You may be scum, but at
least your blood is still red.

16:20.521 --> 16:23.684
Want me to at least let you
die next to your father?

16:23.775 --> 16:26.562
I can be gracious.

16:29.113 --> 16:31.149
Here!

16:35.078 --> 16:37.865
G-Gohan...

16:37.955 --> 16:43.416
Ho, Kakarrot, you're a tough one.
You're still conscious, are you?

16:43.503 --> 16:47.667
Gohan, Daddy's all busted up on the inside...

16:47.757 --> 16:49.998
l-l can't move...

16:50.093 --> 16:53.085
Y-You have to fight in my place...

16:53.179 --> 16:56.421
His power has to have been
reduced significantly...

16:56.516 --> 16:59.804
l-l can't, Father.

16:59.894 --> 17:03.603
H-He's too strong. I can't beat him.

17:03.690 --> 17:05.976
All right, this is the order I'll go in:

17:06.067 --> 17:11.436
First, I'll kill Kakarrot. Next, Kakarrot's kid.

17:11.531 --> 17:15.022
After him, I'll finish off that
bald-headed bastard from earlier.

17:15.117 --> 17:18.781
And lastly, the one that cut off my precious tail!

17:18.871 --> 17:20.827
He remembered 'bout me!

17:20.915 --> 17:25.579
Y-You don't have to beat him...
J-Just keep him at bay...

17:25.670 --> 17:30.585
Your power should be much
better than this... much better...

17:30.675 --> 17:35.715
And then, I'll have Kuririn finish him off...

17:36.973 --> 17:40.306
I can't do it. I can't move anymore, either.

17:40.393 --> 17:44.636
You jackass! Do you want everyone
else's death to be in vain?!

17:44.731 --> 17:48.064
What did Piccolo teach you?!

17:51.237 --> 17:54.070
|'m counting on you, Gohan...

18:04.625 --> 18:07.207
G-Gohan...

18:07.295 --> 18:09.035
Give me trouble, will you?!

18:13.134 --> 18:16.672
S-Stop... that...

18:18.097 --> 18:20.179
Stop that!

18:20.266 --> 18:22.348
What?

18:22.435 --> 18:25.723
I'm going to...

18:25.813 --> 18:27.314
...defeat you!

18:27.398 --> 18:31.607
Hmph, you are going to defeat me?

18:38.868 --> 18:40.779
What?!

18:42.455 --> 18:47.370
Kuririn! Kuririn, please! Come here!

18:47.460 --> 18:50.668
Damn it...

18:54.258 --> 18:56.795
Don't you mess around with Vegeta!

18:56.886 --> 19:01.755
Goku, this is impossible. He's just too strong.

19:01.849 --> 19:04.511
Why didn't you tell Gohan to run away?

19:04.602 --> 19:09.517
K-Kuririn, I'm going to give
you this, before it's too late...

19:09.607 --> 19:13.725
The Genki Dama I've collected
from the whole Earth...

19:15.905 --> 19:19.523
W-What did you say? What are you giving me?

19:19.617 --> 19:24.702
A G-Genki Dama. A little Ki I've
gathered from all over the earth...

19:24.789 --> 19:27.405
About half of it has gotten away,

19:27.500 --> 19:30.412
but the way he is now, I still
think it's enough to defeat him...

19:30.503 --> 19:31.788
W-What?

19:31.879 --> 19:37.044
Kuririn, hold onto my hand...

19:38.970 --> 19:42.633
Hurry! Gohan is gonna die!

19:42.723 --> 19:44.679
Y-You just want me to hold onto your hand?

19:44.767 --> 19:45.973
Please...

19:46.060 --> 19:47.300
Like this?

19:47.395 --> 19:50.307
Your arm is broken, isn't it?!

19:50.398 --> 19:53.356
Just like that. Don't let go.

19:53.442 --> 19:56.980
I'm giving it to you... Take it...

20:12.795 --> 20:16.834
W-W-What is this?

20:16.924 --> 20:19.916
I-I-It's incredible! It's an incredible amount of Ki!

20:20.011 --> 20:26.974
T-Take it, and focus it above
your palm... It will create a ball...

20:34.775 --> 20:37.767
You filthy brat!

20:43.409 --> 20:49.951
Hang in there... Gohan ain't
able to control this kind of Ki...

20:53.794 --> 20:56.501
T-There it is! This is a...

20:56.589 --> 21:00.298
...Genki Dama. Y-You did it...

21:02.053 --> 21:05.637
Pesky brat!

21:05.723 --> 21:12.811
Kuririn... hit him with it...
I can't make another Genki Dama...

21:12.897 --> 21:16.606
Y-You've got to make sure you hit him... Please...

21:16.692 --> 21:20.276
A-All right. I'll try.

21:21.405 --> 21:24.863
Will Kuririn be able to stop Vegeta

21:24.951 --> 21:29.445
with the Genki Dama entrusted to him?

21:31.916 --> 21:34.828
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

21:34.919 --> 21:39.413
Fly away into the boundless skies

21:39.507 --> 21:42.340
We'll hitch a ride on the jet stream,

21:42.426 --> 21:45.463
and zip away to wherever we want

21:45.554 --> 21:47.806
Being a daredevil is the best

21:47.890 --> 21:51.223
Let's go tip-top! All right?

21:51.310 --> 21:57.101
This eye-opening blue Earth of ours

21:57.191 --> 22:03.278
is our irreplaceable world,
and we're not giving it up

22:04.657 --> 22:07.615
Blast offa Kamehame-Ha

22:07.702 --> 22:10.865
You were born

22:10.955 --> 22:16.575
to protect the world in these uncertain times

22:16.669 --> 22:19.581
Yeah! Break! Care! Break! As hard as you can

22:19.672 --> 22:22.789
Go at it full power

22:22.883 --> 22:26.842
Hope is my weapon,

22:26.929 --> 22:30.171
so believe in the future

22:34.103 --> 22:35.559
Heya! I'm Goku!

22:35.646 --> 22:37.978
Hit him, Genki Dama, packed with our hopes!

22:38.065 --> 22:40.477
To think that trash like you could push me this far.

22:40.568 --> 22:42.650
It wounds my pride.

22:42.737 --> 22:45.023
Would you people drop dead already?!

22:45.114 --> 22:48.026
Gohan, please. You're our last hope.

22:48.117 --> 22:50.654
His tail has grown back!

22:50.745 --> 22:52.576
Next time on Dragon Ball Z Kai,

22:52.663 --> 22:56.326
"Defeat the Invulnerable Vegeta!
Work a Miracle, Son Gohan. "

22:56.417 --> 23:00.251
Look at the ball of light...? The ball of light...?

23:01.305 --> 23:07.905
