00:49.892 --> 00:51.059
- Bloody hell.

01:03.742 --> 01:06.040
- Welcome to Morlands.

01:06.040 --> 01:07.387
Come in!

01:07.387 --> 01:09.224
It's all happening.

01:09.224 --> 01:11.840
Thanks, darling, thank you.

01:11.840 --> 01:13.066
You all right, lads?

01:17.949 --> 01:19.087
- Hi, you having fun?

01:19.087 --> 01:20.290
- It's lovely.
- Oh, it's lovely.

01:20.290 --> 01:21.123
- Yeah?

01:21.123 --> 01:23.586
Good, good, Jen, come and meet people.

01:23.586 --> 01:24.475
- I said I'd wait for John.

01:24.475 --> 01:27.427
He's just gone to the toilet.
- Oh, come on!

01:27.427 --> 01:30.401
Carley, this is my cousin, Jenny.

01:30.401 --> 01:31.378
- Hi.
- Hi.

01:31.378 --> 01:32.617
- Carley works in advertising.

01:32.617 --> 01:33.450
- Really?
- Yeah.

01:33.450 --> 01:35.628
- What do you do?
- Oh, I work in a bank.

01:35.628 --> 01:37.462
- Investment or commercial?

01:38.564 --> 01:40.133
- I'd hate to have my
life discussed like that.

01:40.133 --> 01:40.966
- Well...

01:40.966 --> 01:43.526
- Yeah, but apparently,
this place cost 80,000.

01:43.526 --> 01:44.560
- No!

01:44.560 --> 01:47.340
God, hope they don't regret it.

01:47.340 --> 01:48.173
- Well, why would they?

01:48.173 --> 01:49.006
I mean, look at it.

01:49.006 --> 01:49.839
It's stunning.

01:49.839 --> 01:51.365
- More champagne?

01:51.365 --> 01:52.376
- Oh, Tina, sorry.

01:52.376 --> 01:53.519
We didn't mean anything.

01:53.519 --> 01:54.360
- It's all right.

01:54.360 --> 01:55.593
Thanks, Jude.

01:55.593 --> 01:56.426
Del.

01:56.426 --> 01:58.465
- Tina.
- Hi, when'd you get here?

01:58.465 --> 02:00.305
- Wow, what a party, a while ago now.

02:00.305 --> 02:02.173
sorry.

02:02.173 --> 02:03.121
It's a bit crazy.

02:03.121 --> 02:04.050
- It's all right.

02:04.050 --> 02:05.204
Your fault for being so popular.

02:06.575 --> 02:08.325
Listen, I was wondering if I could grab

02:08.325 --> 02:09.873
a moment with you and
Bobby a bit later on.

02:09.873 --> 02:12.790
- Yeah.
- Got a proposition for you.

02:17.469 --> 02:19.719
- I wouldn't mind a refill.

02:20.641 --> 02:23.641
- I think you've had enough already.

02:24.677 --> 02:26.260
- Del wants a word.

02:32.473 --> 02:33.855
Here we are, Del.
- Del.

02:33.855 --> 02:34.688
Bobby.

02:34.688 --> 02:36.162
- Hear you've been chatting up my wife.

02:36.162 --> 02:39.964
Listen, I've
been looking at this place.

02:39.964 --> 02:41.114
Woolston Hall, it's called.

02:41.114 --> 02:44.616
Now, it needs a bit of TLC,
but I think it could be

02:44.616 --> 02:48.610
the perfect setting for an
exclusive private members' club.

02:48.610 --> 02:50.520
- Sounds right up our
street, don't it, Bobby?

02:50.520 --> 02:51.386
- What's the joining fee?

02:51.386 --> 02:53.218
- Now, in this case, I'm thinking

02:53.218 --> 02:55.058
more business than pleasure.

02:55.058 --> 02:57.719
I want you two to come in with me.

02:57.719 --> 03:00.713
- Since when have you been an
expert in hospitality, Del?

03:00.713 --> 03:04.034
- I know what a good time
looks like, so do these two.

03:04.034 --> 03:06.743
Our friend, Mr. Connery,
is already on board.

03:06.743 --> 03:09.051
And I've got two serious
investors lined up

03:09.051 --> 03:11.612
but I wanted to give
you two first refusal.

03:11.612 --> 03:13.241
- Do you think it would
be something for us?

03:13.241 --> 03:14.458
Why not?

03:14.458 --> 03:15.933
- Sounds expensive.

03:15.933 --> 03:18.766
- Golden couple, golden price tag.

03:22.980 --> 03:26.363
Now, you're gonna need
a bit of vision, Bobby.

03:26.363 --> 03:29.750
But, I know you've never had
any problems in that respect.

03:29.750 --> 03:33.575
Land over there, perfect
for another nine holes.

03:33.575 --> 03:37.397
Building needs a bit of a
facelift, obviously, but it's got

03:37.397 --> 03:41.058
good bones and there's
no denying its potential.

03:41.058 --> 03:41.891
Come with me.

03:41.891 --> 03:43.565
Want to show you inside.

03:43.565 --> 03:45.038
- Tina's gonna love this.

03:45.038 --> 03:49.266
Room for a
swimming pool 'round the back.

03:49.266 --> 03:50.726
Tadaka with a kick.

03:50.726 --> 03:53.381
- That's the golf course behind.

03:53.381 --> 03:54.661
We had a band on the opening night.

03:54.661 --> 03:56.328
Weather was perfect.

03:58.436 --> 03:59.695
- Are those flamingos?

03:59.695 --> 04:01.410
- Yeah, we had 'em sent in.

04:01.410 --> 04:03.571
Adds to the drama.

04:03.571 --> 04:05.149
- What's that?

04:05.149 --> 04:06.510
- That's the spa.

04:06.510 --> 04:08.679
He's Vidal Sassoon's top man, him.

04:08.679 --> 04:10.011
- Is he a footballer too?

04:10.011 --> 04:11.052
- No, Bob.

04:11.052 --> 04:13.096
Oh, it's certainly very impressive, Tina.

04:13.096 --> 04:14.572
I don't know how you and Robert do it.

04:14.572 --> 04:15.541
You should come.

04:15.541 --> 04:16.610
Make a day of it.

04:16.610 --> 04:19.519
Sounds nice, doesn't it, Bob?

04:19.519 --> 04:20.352
- Yeah.

04:21.628 --> 04:23.295
Moore.

04:24.846 --> 04:26.992
Oh, he's in trouble, Lubanski!

04:26.992 --> 04:30.216
Moore was too casual, two nil!

04:38.922 --> 04:40.534
- Got a moment, Bobby?

04:40.534 --> 04:41.451
- Oh, yeah.

04:48.007 --> 04:50.257
Alf, I had a horrible game.

04:51.534 --> 04:52.367
I'm sorry.

04:53.810 --> 04:56.592
And I know I've had a bit of a dip

04:56.592 --> 04:59.087
in my form lately, but I am working on it.

04:59.087 --> 05:00.753
- Now, don't be too hard on yourself.

05:00.753 --> 05:02.920
- No, it was unforgivable.

05:04.343 --> 05:06.593
But, it won't happen again.

05:09.188 --> 05:11.110
I can assure you I'm totally focused on--

05:11.110 --> 05:14.661
- Perhaps now would be a good
time for some breathing space.

05:14.661 --> 05:16.513
I've got to balance the team as a whole.

05:16.513 --> 05:19.146
And I know you'd agree that
Norman earned his chance.

05:23.142 --> 05:24.064
- You're dropping me?

05:24.064 --> 05:27.430
- Let's just take it one
game at a time, shall we?

05:27.430 --> 05:30.013
Right, I'll leave you in peace.

05:41.529 --> 05:43.446
- On there, sit, Bobby!

05:44.988 --> 05:46.239
I made lunch.

05:46.239 --> 05:47.322
- Not hungry.

05:48.777 --> 05:49.610
- Dad's back!

05:49.610 --> 05:51.038
- No, no, no, go and play.

05:51.038 --> 05:52.390
See your dad later.

05:52.390 --> 05:53.223
Go on!

06:02.650 --> 06:05.067
Don't beat yourself up.

06:05.067 --> 06:06.317
It's one match.

06:09.338 --> 06:10.921
- Alf's dropped me.

06:12.368 --> 06:13.201
- What?

06:15.014 --> 06:15.847
He can't do that.

06:15.847 --> 06:17.430
You're his captain.

06:19.552 --> 06:21.416
- I deserved it.

06:21.416 --> 06:22.444
I let the boys down.

06:22.444 --> 06:24.224
- Oh, come on.

06:24.224 --> 06:26.472
You're always so hard on yourself.

06:26.472 --> 06:28.552
It was a slip-up.

06:28.552 --> 06:30.912
He's probably resting you.

06:30.912 --> 06:32.745
- He's not resting me.

06:34.639 --> 06:36.722
My England days are over.

06:42.923 --> 06:45.590
- Bobby, look, whatever happens,

06:47.764 --> 06:51.847
the kids and I love you
and think you're amazing.

06:52.727 --> 06:55.599
I know you can't see it now, but we've got

06:55.599 --> 06:58.645
so many things to be thankful for.

07:11.752 --> 07:15.586
- Wow!

07:15.586 --> 07:19.843
Thank you, mm.

07:19.843 --> 07:22.226
- Why has Daddy only got one candle?

07:22.226 --> 07:23.939
- Because when you're as old as I am,

07:23.939 --> 07:25.193
you can't fit them all on the cake.

07:26.747 --> 07:28.003
Look at all this.

07:28.003 --> 07:29.362
- Here.

07:29.362 --> 07:30.743
- What's this, a diamond ring?

07:35.311 --> 07:36.764
- Del helped me pick it.

07:36.764 --> 07:39.357
- Come here, over here!

07:39.357 --> 07:40.413
- Oh, let's go.

07:58.578 --> 08:01.320
- If it's not right, we can take it back.

08:04.762 --> 08:05.833
- Who's up for a test drive?

08:05.833 --> 08:07.166
Yes!

08:16.422 --> 08:19.095
- Del, you're not going, are you?

08:19.095 --> 08:20.276
I've been thinking of giving

08:20.276 --> 08:22.254
taster sessions at Woolston Hall.

08:22.254 --> 08:26.004
Giving discounts for
people who sign up, Del?

08:29.113 --> 08:31.354
- I'm sorry, Tina.

08:31.354 --> 08:32.882
I never thought this would happen.

08:32.882 --> 08:33.960
- What?

08:33.960 --> 08:35.854
- You should probably
talk to Bobby about it.

08:35.854 --> 08:37.354
- What'd you mean?

08:39.100 --> 08:43.975
- I hope this won't affect
our friendship.

08:43.975 --> 08:45.142
You take care.

08:57.199 --> 08:58.588
How could it get this bad?

08:58.588 --> 08:59.908
I'll talk you
through the statements.

08:59.908 --> 09:00.741
It's all there

09:00.741 --> 09:01.895
Oh, it's a bit late for that.

09:01.895 --> 09:03.278
You should have kept on top of things.

09:03.278 --> 09:04.950
- This club was your venture.

09:04.950 --> 09:06.254
- And you're my business manager.

09:06.254 --> 09:07.752
- Oh, come on.

09:07.752 --> 09:09.474
Look, I know it's a shock but I warned you

09:09.474 --> 09:10.810
this was a high-risk investment.

09:10.810 --> 09:13.409
- Don't you dare gloat.

09:13.409 --> 09:15.620
- I take no pleasure in this, none at all!

09:15.620 --> 09:17.453
- Bobby, just saw Del.

09:21.059 --> 09:22.910
Can't be that bad.

09:22.910 --> 09:25.447
All businesses lose
money in the first year.

09:25.447 --> 09:28.100
- The income's not even
covering the overheads.

09:28.100 --> 09:30.306
Woolston Hall is miles in the red.

09:30.306 --> 09:32.562
The only option is to fold.

09:32.562 --> 09:36.186
- Well, we'll sell back
our share, lose 5,000.

09:36.186 --> 09:38.103
- It's worse than that.

09:39.020 --> 09:39.937
- How much?

09:42.728 --> 09:44.211
Tell me, Bobby.

09:44.211 --> 09:45.544
- Hundred grand.

10:03.670 --> 10:07.339
- Where are we gonna get the money?

10:07.339 --> 10:08.589
- I don't know.

10:12.819 --> 10:14.402
- What we gonna do?

10:15.486 --> 10:20.259
The kids' schools, the
mortgage on this place, Spain.

10:20.259 --> 10:21.676
- Hey, come here.

10:28.385 --> 10:30.135
I'll take care of it.

10:31.821 --> 10:32.654
I promise.

10:39.862 --> 10:44.029
Ron, I need to make my last
years on the pitch pay.

10:48.621 --> 10:51.167
It's time for me to leave the club.

10:51.167 --> 10:52.745
Now, we've had our differences,

10:52.745 --> 10:56.162
but I hope we can part ways respectfully.

10:57.488 --> 10:59.446
- I've always had the utmost
respect for you, Bobby.

10:59.446 --> 11:01.711
Only wish you could have
said the same about me.

11:01.711 --> 11:03.339
I think it's a pity.

11:03.339 --> 11:05.180
I thought we could have
achieved so much more.

11:05.180 --> 11:07.097
- We've had a fair run.

11:08.027 --> 11:09.220
I've worked hard.

11:09.220 --> 11:12.220
- You have, yes, when it suited you.

11:13.618 --> 11:15.891
- Are you gonna let me go or not?

11:15.891 --> 11:17.716
- If you've made up your
mind, I'll tell the board

11:17.716 --> 11:22.507
and we'll get the word
out that you're available.

11:22.507 --> 11:23.507
- Thank you.

11:26.087 --> 11:27.587
I appreciate that.

11:29.503 --> 11:31.086
50,000 fee.

11:35.207 --> 11:36.040
- A fee?

11:37.416 --> 11:39.588
No, I need a free transfer.

11:39.588 --> 11:42.355
- I'd be letting my club down
if I let you go for nothing.

11:45.964 --> 11:48.417
- This isn't about the club.

11:48.417 --> 11:50.806
No, this is personal.

11:50.806 --> 11:53.187
- Football is my life, Bobby.

11:53.187 --> 11:55.367
Of course it's personal.

11:55.367 --> 11:56.530
- But without a free transfer,

11:56.530 --> 11:57.523
you won't get a signing-on fee.

11:57.523 --> 11:59.050
- I know, Tina.
- We needed that lump sum.

11:59.050 --> 12:00.058
You should have told Ron.

12:00.058 --> 12:02.022
- What, get down on my hands and knees?

12:02.022 --> 12:03.772
The man's impossible.

12:05.025 --> 12:05.942
- What now?

12:06.927 --> 12:08.165
- It'll be okay.

12:08.165 --> 12:08.998
Fulham have come in.

12:08.998 --> 12:11.223
They're offering a decent wage.

12:11.223 --> 12:13.113
We'll just have to chip away at the debt.

12:13.113 --> 12:14.139
- It could take years.

12:14.139 --> 12:14.972
You're 33.

12:14.972 --> 12:15.805
- I'm still fit.

12:15.805 --> 12:17.401
- You're not superhuman.

12:17.401 --> 12:18.627
- You called me a god once, remember?

12:18.627 --> 12:19.947
- Bobby, I'm being serious.

12:19.947 --> 12:21.197
- I don't know.

12:22.355 --> 12:24.213
Look, something'll come
up, another advert, maybe.

12:24.213 --> 12:25.963
- Look, be realistic.

12:27.441 --> 12:28.436
Do we have to sell this place?

12:28.436 --> 12:29.269
- No.

12:29.269 --> 12:31.729
- Well, I'd rather do that than
get the kids out of school.

12:31.729 --> 12:33.666
- Well, maybe you should
just rein it in a bit!

12:33.666 --> 12:35.175
Stop shopping at Harrods.

12:35.175 --> 12:36.850
- I hardly ever shop at Harrods!

12:36.850 --> 12:38.824
- Let's not pretend you
don't enjoy the finer things.

12:38.824 --> 12:40.186
Are you blaming me for this?

12:40.186 --> 12:41.264
- Of course not.

12:41.264 --> 12:42.804
- All right, well, I'll get a job.

12:42.804 --> 12:44.025
You don't need to do that.

12:44.025 --> 12:45.622
- I want to help contribute.

12:45.622 --> 12:46.909
I can provide for this family!

12:46.909 --> 12:48.527
- It shouldn't all rest
on your shoulders, Bobby.

12:48.527 --> 12:50.360
It's too big a burden!

12:52.189 --> 12:53.439
What you doing?

13:01.351 --> 13:03.896
- It's our last bottle, so enjoy it.

13:04.729 --> 13:05.562
Bottoms up.

13:16.842 --> 13:20.434
be a long, long time

13:21.572 --> 13:22.505
- Bobby.

13:22.505 --> 13:23.338
- Elton.

13:23.338 --> 13:24.369
- Thanks for dropping by.

13:33.456 --> 13:34.670
Ladies and gentlemen,

13:34.670 --> 13:36.571
please put your hands together,

13:36.571 --> 13:38.662
retiring today after a thousand games

13:38.662 --> 13:41.720
in professional football, Mr. Bobby Moore.

14:23.892 --> 14:25.699
- How was Watford?

14:25.699 --> 14:26.866
- I got a job.

14:28.054 --> 14:29.087
- What?

14:29.087 --> 14:30.165
Where?

14:30.165 --> 14:32.082
- In a bakery, manager.

14:33.648 --> 14:35.130
- Really?

14:35.130 --> 14:38.800
- I met with Elton John and
he thinks I'd be a good fit.

14:38.800 --> 14:40.204
Watford aren't the greatest club

14:40.204 --> 14:43.023
in the world, but it's a good start.

14:43.023 --> 14:46.940
See, not ready for the
knacker's yard just yet.

15:19.147 --> 15:21.147
Let's have another baby.

15:24.827 --> 15:25.660
Why not?

15:25.660 --> 15:26.493
You're not too old.

15:26.493 --> 15:29.078
- Where's this come from?

15:29.078 --> 15:30.105
I thought we'd done all that.

15:30.105 --> 15:31.432
- You loved having small children.

15:31.432 --> 15:32.434
- I had help.

15:32.434 --> 15:33.267
- So?

15:33.267 --> 15:36.909
Get help again, and I was
thinking that we could look

15:36.909 --> 15:39.927
into buying a new villa out here.

15:39.927 --> 15:41.281
You know, like our old one.

15:41.281 --> 15:43.023
- This is our first
holiday in three years.

15:43.023 --> 15:47.787
- Yeah, and I'm manager of
Watford now, a whole new start.

15:47.787 --> 15:50.454
- Well, I'm about to start work.

15:51.392 --> 15:54.773
- You've got plenty of time for all that.

15:54.773 --> 15:57.122
We've got our whole
lives ahead of us, Tina.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.789
Hey, think about it.

16:03.406 --> 16:05.187
- You're serious?

16:05.187 --> 16:06.020
- Mm-hm.

16:06.889 --> 16:09.639
- All right, I'll think about it.

16:24.092 --> 16:24.925
I don't get it.

16:24.925 --> 16:26.876
I thought they offered you the job.

16:26.876 --> 16:30.452
I must have
got it wrong, mustn't I?

16:30.452 --> 16:34.750
- Well, you don't want
to work for them anyway.

16:34.750 --> 16:35.687
Oh, come on.

16:35.687 --> 16:37.558
It's the first team
that showed an interest.

16:37.558 --> 16:39.674
What are they, Third Division?

16:39.674 --> 16:41.007
- Fourth.
- See?

16:42.983 --> 16:46.159
You've dodged a bullet if you ask me.

16:46.159 --> 16:47.400
You'll be fine.

16:47.400 --> 16:48.964
I promise.

16:48.964 --> 16:50.298
As England's new manager,

16:50.298 --> 16:52.175
what do you intend to do for the team?

16:52.175 --> 16:53.905
- The boys have taken a knock lately,

16:53.905 --> 16:55.848
so I'll be starting from the ground up,

16:55.848 --> 16:58.889
building confidence,
instilling a team mentality.

16:58.889 --> 17:01.497
And to help me, I'll be
bringing one of the stars

17:01.497 --> 17:05.187
of the '66 squad as my
assistant, Geoff Hurst.

17:05.187 --> 17:06.461
- Don't let this knock you.

17:06.461 --> 17:07.336
You're still worth a lot.

17:07.336 --> 17:09.161
You'd be an asset to any team.

17:09.161 --> 17:10.432
- Please, Tina.

17:10.432 --> 17:11.399
- What, I'm trying--

17:11.399 --> 17:13.065
- But you don't know the first thing

17:13.065 --> 17:15.398
about the FA so please
just stay out of it.

17:15.398 --> 17:19.142
Thank you for your time.

17:23.992 --> 17:25.075
- How's Tina?

17:26.962 --> 17:31.129
- Fine, she's just got a
new job, doing very well.

17:32.462 --> 17:34.723
So, what have you got for me, Jack?

17:34.723 --> 17:36.600
Only so much gardening a bloke can do.

17:36.600 --> 17:37.709
- Yeah, well, I might have an exhibition

17:37.709 --> 17:39.191
match coming up in August.

17:39.191 --> 17:40.024
- August?

17:40.024 --> 17:41.013
That's months away.

17:41.013 --> 17:42.392
- And there's a charity thing I'm waiting

17:42.392 --> 17:44.546
to hear back from, a fantastic cause.

17:44.546 --> 17:48.532
- That's great, but I
need to keep earning.

17:48.532 --> 17:49.873
- Bobby, what can I do?

17:49.873 --> 17:51.465
Things have gone quiet.

17:51.465 --> 17:52.896
It will perk up, though.

17:52.896 --> 17:54.757
- What about management?

17:54.757 --> 17:56.771
- Oxford City did ask if you're available.

17:56.771 --> 17:58.096
- Oh yeah, what did you say?

17:58.096 --> 18:00.519
- Nothing, they're non-league,
a bunch of part-timers.

18:00.519 --> 18:02.105
- And I've been out of work for 18 months.

18:02.105 --> 18:03.205
I'm climbing the walls, Jack.

18:03.205 --> 18:04.210
- Bobby, trust me.

18:04.210 --> 18:06.127
Something will turn up.

18:07.721 --> 18:10.504
- Tell them I'll take it.

18:10.504 --> 18:12.504
- Bobby!
- I'll take it.

18:13.366 --> 18:15.076
Wide, wide, get it wide.

18:15.076 --> 18:15.990
Cross it early.

18:15.990 --> 18:17.374
Cross it early!

18:17.374 --> 18:19.957
Oh, for Pete's sake, pull back!

18:22.571 --> 18:24.294
Chase him, chase him!

18:24.294 --> 18:25.127
Come on, oh!

18:31.333 --> 18:34.099
Don't take it too hard, lads.

18:34.099 --> 18:36.250
We've just got to put a
bit of graft in, all right?

18:36.250 --> 18:38.174
First thing Monday morning, we'll get

18:38.174 --> 18:41.961
working on the back four, all right?

18:41.961 --> 18:45.262
- Thing is, Mr. Moore, most
of us do nine-to-fives.

18:45.262 --> 18:49.262
- Yeah, nothing I'd like
more than to skip work.

19:12.346 --> 19:13.823
- Thanks for the call.

19:13.823 --> 19:15.536
It's nice to do something,
just the two of us.

19:15.536 --> 19:16.551
- How are things?

19:16.551 --> 19:18.159
- Oh, Roberta's hormonal.

19:18.159 --> 19:19.528
Dean's discovered Pink Floyd.

19:19.528 --> 19:20.817
If I hear Another Brick In The Wall

19:20.817 --> 19:22.977
one more time, I'm gonna lose my mind.

19:22.977 --> 19:24.423
- Bobby okay?

19:24.423 --> 19:27.588
- Well, the truth is,
I'm worried about him.

19:27.588 --> 19:29.935
He's killing himself at Oxford City.

19:29.935 --> 19:31.419
He spends so much time away, and when he

19:31.419 --> 19:32.621
is home, he just doesn't speak.

19:32.621 --> 19:33.454
- I'm sorry.

19:33.454 --> 19:34.931
Tina, that must be really hard for you.

19:34.931 --> 19:35.764
- Oh, it's fine.

19:35.764 --> 19:36.597
I can cope.

19:36.597 --> 19:38.588
I just want him to be okay.

19:38.588 --> 19:41.994
What he's been through the past
few years, it's beneath him.

19:41.994 --> 19:43.077
- Yes, it is.

19:44.135 --> 19:44.968
- What?

19:50.923 --> 19:52.890
Carley, what is it?

19:52.890 --> 19:55.577
- I'm only telling you this
because I respect you, Tina.

19:55.577 --> 19:56.410
- Okay.

19:57.479 --> 19:59.729
- Bobby's having an affair.

20:03.189 --> 20:07.047
Oh, don't be stupid.

20:07.047 --> 20:08.295
- We ran into him in Tramp.

20:08.295 --> 20:09.144
He was with another woman.

20:09.144 --> 20:10.977
- So, that doesn't mean...

20:13.626 --> 20:15.376
That could be anyone.

20:17.045 --> 20:17.999
Why are you saying this to me?

20:17.999 --> 20:19.104
- I care about you, Tina.

20:19.104 --> 20:22.354
I don't want him to make a fool of you.

20:43.857 --> 20:45.988
- Did you and Carley fall out?

20:45.988 --> 20:48.134
- Why would you say that?

20:48.134 --> 20:49.735
- Well, you've barely said a word

20:49.735 --> 20:50.889
since you came back from your lunch.

20:50.889 --> 20:53.098
- She said something, clearly rubbish,

20:53.098 --> 20:55.808
but it just wasn't very nice.

20:55.808 --> 20:57.473
- What?

20:57.473 --> 20:58.973
- Don't get angry.

21:00.140 --> 21:01.613
- Tina?

21:01.613 --> 21:05.343
- She said you were having an affair.

21:05.343 --> 21:06.385
- Of course it's rubbish.

21:06.385 --> 21:09.047
- She saw you with a woman in Tramp.

21:09.047 --> 21:09.880
- So?

21:11.281 --> 21:12.750
Me and the lads go there all the time.

21:12.750 --> 21:13.599
Of course I speak to women.

21:13.599 --> 21:15.734
I speak to a lot of people.

21:15.734 --> 21:17.470
That's generally what
you do on a night out.

21:17.470 --> 21:19.608
- I just don't understand
why she'd say it if--

21:19.608 --> 21:22.025
- You believe her, don't you?

21:25.699 --> 21:27.818
She's nothing but a
jealous, vindictive bitch.

21:27.818 --> 21:28.779
- Bobby!
- I'm sorry.

21:28.779 --> 21:31.407
But I won't let her come between us.

21:31.407 --> 21:35.157
I would never cheat on you, Tina, never.

21:43.538 --> 21:45.572
I've always fancied Hong Kong.

21:45.572 --> 21:49.655
I suppose I'll have to
hand my notice in at work.

21:50.827 --> 21:52.483
- It's up to you, Tina.

21:52.483 --> 21:54.167
- What do you mean?

21:54.167 --> 21:58.653
- Well, you could stay
here, if you wanted to.

21:58.653 --> 22:01.788
I don't expect you to turn your
life upside down for my job.

22:01.788 --> 22:04.455
- Well, how long will
you be over there for?

22:04.455 --> 22:06.127
- It's hard to say.

22:06.127 --> 22:07.431
- Well, if it was only for a few months,

22:07.431 --> 22:09.103
it makes sense for me to stay.

22:09.103 --> 22:12.270
- I dunno, hopefully longer than that.

22:14.326 --> 22:17.757
- Would you like me to come with you?

22:17.757 --> 22:19.824
- It's up to you.

22:19.824 --> 22:22.505
- You've never wanted me to work before.

22:22.505 --> 22:25.844
- Well, I can see it makes you happy.

22:25.844 --> 22:27.948
I'm proud of you.

22:27.948 --> 22:29.513
- Can't you get a job nearer?

22:29.513 --> 22:33.383
I mean, Hong Kong is not exactly
famous for football, is it?

22:33.383 --> 22:34.967
- Since when did you become the expert?

22:34.967 --> 22:36.902
- You know what I mean.

22:36.902 --> 22:39.142
- Well, I've accepted
the job and I'm gonna

22:39.142 --> 22:41.809
do it to the best of my ability.

22:42.965 --> 22:44.692
If you want to stay, I'll understand.

22:44.692 --> 22:46.608
We'll make it work.

22:46.608 --> 22:48.608
Otherwise, come with me.

22:51.793 --> 22:53.960
- I want to come with you.

22:56.796 --> 22:57.765
- Great.

22:57.765 --> 22:58.598
- Okay.

23:01.093 --> 23:03.458
Alan Balls is second in
command so that cheered him up.

23:03.458 --> 23:04.659
- Oh.
- It'll be nice to see

23:04.659 --> 23:06.328
Lesley when we're out there.

23:06.328 --> 23:07.407
- Well, yeah, I think you'll have fun.

23:07.407 --> 23:09.443
- Yeah, well, it's not ideal.

23:09.443 --> 23:12.404
At least he's not moping
around here drinking.

23:12.404 --> 23:13.731
Hello, Tina speaking.

23:13.731 --> 23:14.928
Hello, Mrs.
Moore, it's John again.

23:14.928 --> 23:15.761
- Yeah.

23:15.761 --> 23:16.719
They want it.

23:16.719 --> 23:20.251
- Oh, great, all right,
well, what did Mr. Moore say?

23:20.251 --> 23:21.841
I haven't spoken to him yet.

23:21.841 --> 23:22.724
- You haven't, all right.

23:22.724 --> 23:25.867
Well, could I give you a call back?

23:25.867 --> 23:26.938
Yes, of course,
I'll leave it with you.

23:26.938 --> 23:28.309
- Great, all right, bye.

23:28.309 --> 23:29.426
Cheerio.

23:29.426 --> 23:31.515
- Someone wants to rent
the house while we're away.

23:31.515 --> 23:32.470
- Well, that's great!

23:32.470 --> 23:35.539
- Yeah, I need to speak
to Bobby before accepting.

23:35.539 --> 23:36.500
Think I should call?

23:36.500 --> 23:37.926
- Well, what time will
it be over there now?

23:37.926 --> 23:40.124
- Be about five in the morning.

23:40.124 --> 23:41.791
- Don't see why not.

23:42.939 --> 23:43.772
- Yeah.

23:51.919 --> 23:53.530
Hope he's not too grumpy.

24:02.943 --> 24:04.094
Hello?

24:04.094 --> 24:05.094
- Oh, hello?

24:06.617 --> 24:09.293
Oh, I must have the wrong number.

24:09.293 --> 24:12.038
I'm looking for Bobby Moore.

24:12.038 --> 24:14.955
Yeah, just one minute.

24:18.038 --> 24:19.596
- Hello.

24:21.227 --> 24:22.144
Who's this?

24:25.325 --> 24:26.742
- It's your wife.

24:32.511 --> 24:33.344
Who's she?

24:34.325 --> 24:38.247
- No one, sister of the
man who owns the flat.

24:42.902 --> 24:44.952
Was that her?

24:44.952 --> 24:45.785
- Yeah.

24:47.273 --> 24:50.023
- He's in bed with another woman.

24:53.229 --> 24:56.062
Right now, he's lying next to her.

25:08.561 --> 25:10.081
- Tina, I swear it's true.

25:18.222 --> 25:21.055
- I've always trusted him, always,

25:22.158 --> 25:23.741
even when Carley...

25:26.286 --> 25:27.703
I feel so stupid.

25:29.550 --> 25:32.716
- I'm as shocked as you
are, but we all know

25:32.716 --> 25:35.805
that there's womanizers in
the game, but not Bobby.

25:35.805 --> 25:38.640
No, I mean, he adores you.

25:38.640 --> 25:41.973
- I've given him everything, everything.

25:44.271 --> 25:46.188
From the moment we met,

25:48.598 --> 25:51.181
it was him, you know, the kids.

25:53.809 --> 25:57.142
Even our business, everything with Jack,

26:00.183 --> 26:02.100
it was us, as a couple.

26:05.644 --> 26:07.061
The golden couple

26:11.228 --> 26:13.541
What am I gonna do?

26:13.541 --> 26:16.458
- Well, are you gonna go out there?

26:22.266 --> 26:24.516
- Do you think she's young?

26:28.056 --> 26:29.368
Younger than me?

26:29.368 --> 26:31.618
- You're still young, Tina.

26:37.030 --> 26:39.576
- I'm gonna have to fight.

27:12.843 --> 27:13.676
- Tina.

27:26.766 --> 27:29.933
You said you were getting in tomorrow.

27:31.068 --> 27:32.393
I would have met you at the airport.

27:32.393 --> 27:34.643
- I wanted to surprise you.

27:42.791 --> 27:43.638
- How was the flight?

27:43.638 --> 27:44.471
- Fine.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.167
- You must be tired.

27:49.997 --> 27:52.209
- I want a drink.

27:52.209 --> 27:54.557
Do you have any wine?

28:31.276 --> 28:32.193
Look at me.

28:50.973 --> 28:51.806
What?

28:53.006 --> 28:53.839
What?

28:55.570 --> 28:57.487
- Nothing, it's just...

28:59.603 --> 29:02.603
I think I've got a bit of a problem.

29:05.315 --> 29:08.234
- What do you mean, "A bit of a problem?"

29:08.234 --> 29:10.815
Does your problem have a name?

29:10.815 --> 29:11.648
- Please, Tina.

29:11.648 --> 29:12.731
- Who is she?

29:14.322 --> 29:16.239
Where did you meet her?

29:17.431 --> 29:20.817
How long has it been going on for?

29:20.817 --> 29:21.650
Bobby, for God's sake!

29:21.650 --> 29:24.198
- Tina, I've got a problem.

29:24.198 --> 29:25.948
I'm trying to fix it.

29:26.837 --> 29:29.170
That's all you need to know.

29:45.218 --> 29:46.568
- Thank you.

29:46.568 --> 29:48.141
- Ooh, it looks nice.
- Thank you.

29:48.141 --> 29:48.987
- What did you get?

29:48.987 --> 29:50.404
- Sweet and sour.

29:51.371 --> 29:53.827
- When did you learn how to use them?

29:53.827 --> 29:54.920
Teach me.

29:54.920 --> 29:55.920
- It's easy.

30:01.428 --> 30:03.631
- The weather forecast looks
nice for your day off tomorrow.

30:03.631 --> 30:05.618
- We should get the tram to Victoria Peak.

30:05.618 --> 30:07.811
Panoramic views of the island, apparently.

30:07.811 --> 30:09.246
- Someone's been reading the guidebook.

30:10.317 --> 30:13.388
- Actually, I was planning
to watch Yuen Long play.

30:13.388 --> 30:15.070
- Oh, you're going to
see how they're set up?

30:15.070 --> 30:16.270
I'd be happy to come with ya.

30:16.270 --> 30:17.254
- Why don't we all go?

30:17.254 --> 30:18.404
- You have a day off, Alan.

30:18.404 --> 30:19.260
- Can't I come?

30:19.260 --> 30:20.093
- I just said.

30:20.093 --> 30:21.411
- Well, I would like to
see more of Hong Kong.

30:21.411 --> 30:22.661
Tina.

30:25.169 --> 30:26.578
- Can't you put me first for once

30:26.578 --> 30:29.503
in your life instead
of second to football?

30:29.503 --> 30:33.670
- What makes you think
you're as high up as second?

30:40.292 --> 30:41.875
Thank you.

30:45.125 --> 30:46.208
- Good night.

30:51.096 --> 30:52.022
- Was that her?

30:52.022 --> 30:52.855
- What?

30:52.855 --> 30:54.636
- Just then, was that her?

30:54.636 --> 30:55.504
Tell me.
- Tina.

30:55.504 --> 30:58.065
- Tell me or I'll scream!

30:58.065 --> 30:58.906
Is this still going on?

30:58.906 --> 31:00.823
Are you still with her?

31:01.674 --> 31:03.227
Bobby, please, I'm losing my mind here.

31:03.227 --> 31:06.227
I need to know what you're thinking.

31:07.402 --> 31:08.652
This is me, us.

31:09.798 --> 31:11.468
We're a team.

31:11.468 --> 31:12.468
You need me!

31:14.412 --> 31:16.908
This other woman, she doesn't matter.

31:16.908 --> 31:17.764
We can forget about it.

31:17.764 --> 31:20.559
Let's go back and start again.

31:20.559 --> 31:22.905
Please, Bobby, please.

31:22.905 --> 31:23.988
- I love her.

31:25.498 --> 31:26.915
I love her, Tina.

31:28.708 --> 31:29.541
I'm sorry.

31:31.033 --> 31:32.977
I'm your wife.

31:32.977 --> 31:34.407
I am your wife, not her!

31:34.407 --> 31:35.657
- Please, Tina!

31:38.993 --> 31:40.284
Oh, I'm sorry.

31:50.375 --> 31:51.958
- Then I'm leaving.

31:56.816 --> 31:59.286
- Tina, Tina, the rumors, are they true?

32:00.481 --> 32:01.731
- Keep driving.

32:32.000 --> 32:33.000
You're back.

32:34.357 --> 32:37.190
- Will you give me another chance?

32:38.584 --> 32:39.417
Please.

32:42.979 --> 32:44.396
- What about her?

32:49.629 --> 32:51.712
- I want to make it work.

33:05.390 --> 33:06.723
- Bobby, dinner!

33:21.251 --> 33:22.501
Dinner's ready.

33:39.880 --> 33:41.463
- It's really nice.

33:42.467 --> 33:43.902
- Sorry, it's nothing special.

33:43.902 --> 33:44.735
No, this is great.

33:44.735 --> 33:45.568
Thank you.

33:49.964 --> 33:52.797
- Roberta's exams start next week.

33:53.910 --> 33:55.507
- I know.

33:55.507 --> 33:57.257
I brought her a card.

33:59.319 --> 34:01.069
- She's working hard.

34:03.048 --> 34:06.015
Dean's school could take
a leaf out of their book.

34:06.015 --> 34:08.991
Oh, remember we have to go in on Friday.

34:08.991 --> 34:11.233
Talk about his truanting.

34:11.233 --> 34:12.066
- Hm.

34:14.048 --> 34:15.965
- You will talk to him?

34:17.013 --> 34:18.470
- I said I would.

34:18.470 --> 34:19.303
- Yeah.

34:23.351 --> 34:25.934
14, well, it's a difficult age.

34:28.526 --> 34:32.109
And it's not been easy
with you being away.

34:39.427 --> 34:40.766
- I'll phone him tomorrow.

34:40.766 --> 34:41.599
- Thanks.

34:45.481 --> 34:46.314
You done?

34:46.314 --> 34:47.397
- Yeah, yeah.

35:06.500 --> 35:09.333
- You're not really here, are you?

35:10.730 --> 35:11.563
- Of course I am.

35:11.563 --> 35:15.313
- No, you're like a
guest staying in a hotel.

35:17.128 --> 35:17.961
I want you back.

35:17.961 --> 35:19.660
I want my husband back.

35:19.660 --> 35:21.743
And if you can't do it...

35:23.493 --> 35:24.326
- What?

35:28.960 --> 35:29.793
Then what?

35:31.592 --> 35:33.747
- I'm going out.

35:33.747 --> 35:36.861
If you're here when I get back,
we'll make a real go of it.

35:36.861 --> 35:39.528
If not, I expect you to be gone.

36:15.716 --> 36:16.549
Bobby?

37:05.277 --> 37:06.694
- You look tired.

37:10.110 --> 37:10.943
Robert?

37:21.445 --> 37:22.862
- I've moved out.

37:24.574 --> 37:26.157
- Moved out, where?

37:27.467 --> 37:30.217
- I'm renting a flat, until I get

37:31.317 --> 37:33.039
something more permanent sorted.

37:33.039 --> 37:34.956
- You mean on your own?

37:35.914 --> 37:38.414
How could Tina have done this?

37:41.293 --> 37:42.376
- Actually...

37:46.606 --> 37:47.773
it's my fault.

37:50.064 --> 37:51.147
- Oh, Robert.

37:54.669 --> 37:56.252
You absolute idiot.

38:03.202 --> 38:04.035
- Bobby.

38:16.650 --> 38:17.817
- Tina.
- Jen.

38:23.044 --> 38:24.255
- I only found out yesterday.

38:24.255 --> 38:27.363
I left messages but you
weren't answering the phone.

38:27.363 --> 38:29.490
I'm sorry, Tina.

38:29.490 --> 38:31.990
- Would you like a cup of tea?

38:39.292 --> 38:40.292
Who told ya?

38:41.498 --> 38:42.717
- Bobby.

38:42.717 --> 38:43.550
- How is he?

38:43.550 --> 38:44.494
- I dunno, I didn't ask.

38:44.494 --> 38:45.327
I was too angry.

38:45.327 --> 38:46.160
- What did he say?

38:46.160 --> 38:47.398
- That he's worried about ya.

38:47.398 --> 38:49.221
- Did you say I was all right?

38:49.221 --> 38:50.221
'Cause I am.

38:53.765 --> 38:54.598
I will be.

39:08.223 --> 39:11.218
- Come and stay with John and me.

39:11.218 --> 39:13.654
- I don't want to intrude.

39:13.654 --> 39:14.922
- I'm not gonna stand by and watch

39:14.922 --> 39:17.089
you fall apart, Tina Teen.

39:24.321 --> 39:27.071
- You sounded just like Mum then.

39:38.983 --> 39:41.523
- You'll hear it all officially anyway,

39:41.523 --> 39:44.743
but I just wanted to
put your mind at rest.

39:44.743 --> 39:47.326
Robert's giving you everything.

39:50.911 --> 39:51.981
- What do you mean, the house?

39:51.981 --> 39:52.981
- All of it.

39:58.236 --> 39:59.903
- I didn't expect...

40:00.766 --> 40:02.516
- It's what he wants.

40:11.564 --> 40:13.397
It's a terrible shame.

40:16.626 --> 40:19.241
You'll be all right, Tina.

40:19.241 --> 40:20.555
You've got a big personality.

40:20.555 --> 40:22.222
You'll be all right.

40:25.945 --> 40:26.925
Thank you, Doss.

40:32.463 --> 40:34.767
- Due to divorce, entire contents

40:34.767 --> 40:37.355
of luxury home in Chigwell for sale.

40:37.355 --> 40:40.022
- It's like a giant jumble sale.

40:41.681 --> 40:42.848
- Welcome to Morlands.

40:50.615 --> 40:53.822
Kathy, We're running out of stuff to sell.

40:53.822 --> 40:55.925
- All right, well, what about the carpet?

40:55.925 --> 40:57.635
- Yeah, carpet, great idea.

40:57.635 --> 41:00.594
Who wants a bit of carpet

41:00.594 --> 41:02.244
walked on by the great Bobby Moore?

41:04.148 --> 41:06.731
A pound a yard, a pound a yard.

41:29.951 --> 41:33.368
- I always thought Bobby
was such a good man.

41:33.368 --> 41:34.535
- He still is.

41:35.377 --> 41:37.793
- How can you say that after everything?

41:37.793 --> 41:40.834
- People do strange things
when they get rejected.

41:40.834 --> 41:41.953
- You didn't reject him.

41:41.953 --> 41:43.845
- No, but football did.

41:43.845 --> 41:45.678
He had to start again.

41:47.454 --> 41:50.226
Yeah, he wanted to be a draftsman

41:50.226 --> 41:51.689
before he got scouted for West Ham.

41:53.526 --> 41:56.378
Imagine how different our
lives would have been.

41:56.378 --> 41:58.987
- Do you think you would
have been as happy?

41:58.987 --> 42:02.070
- Maybe not, maybe not as sad either.

42:05.547 --> 42:06.380
- So what now?

42:08.281 --> 42:09.493
- Well...

42:11.586 --> 42:12.419
Cheers.

42:12.419 --> 42:13.252
- Cheers.

42:36.020 --> 42:40.578
something 'cause I'm burning up

42:44.010 --> 42:48.539
a cure or we're gonna die

42:56.021 --> 42:56.854
- Hello.

42:58.511 --> 43:00.885
Roberta, how are you, darling?

43:00.885 --> 43:02.889
Yeah, I've finished with this place,

43:02.889 --> 43:06.074
so you can come and visit very soon.

43:06.074 --> 43:09.489
Oh, I've got a lot of things to sort out.

43:09.489 --> 43:11.306
Can't wait to see you and Dean.

43:11.306 --> 43:14.556
Yeah, yeah.

43:16.394 --> 43:19.163
I think I'm gonna be really happy here.

43:26.093 --> 43:29.565
This is London-Victoria
train to the airport.

43:29.565 --> 43:32.340
Calling on Heathrow,
London, and .

43:44.106 --> 43:44.939
- Madam.

43:48.639 --> 43:49.472
- Bobby.

43:53.369 --> 43:54.548
What you doing here?

43:54.548 --> 43:56.726
- Covering a match in Brighton.

43:56.726 --> 43:58.059
Just going home.

44:00.649 --> 44:01.816
- How are you?

44:03.484 --> 44:04.317
- Fine.

44:08.445 --> 44:11.418
Nice coat, always did like quality.

44:11.418 --> 44:15.251
- I don't get much chance
to wear it in Miami.

44:16.921 --> 44:19.024
- What brings you back?

44:19.024 --> 44:23.493
- Can't get a decent roast
out there for love nor money.

44:23.493 --> 44:25.624
- Funny, I was just
thinking about our first

44:25.624 --> 44:26.984
Sunday lunch at Gants Hill the other day.

44:26.984 --> 44:28.164
- Oh God, were you?

44:28.164 --> 44:29.922
- Yeah, you were determined to

44:29.922 --> 44:31.994
be the perfect little housewife.

44:31.994 --> 44:34.555
- Your mum saw straight through me.

44:34.555 --> 44:36.612
What did she say?

44:36.612 --> 44:38.567
- "Never had mash with a roast before."

44:38.567 --> 44:39.854
Yes.

44:48.722 --> 44:51.722
- Tina, I always meant to say sorry.

44:52.886 --> 44:54.219
- Bobby, please.

44:58.825 --> 45:02.960
Clapham Junction,
next stop, Clapham Junction.

45:02.960 --> 45:03.793
- Sorry.

45:05.172 --> 45:06.005
Your stop.

45:07.199 --> 45:08.032
- Yeah.

45:50.458 --> 45:53.415
- You still got this old case, then?

45:53.415 --> 45:54.848
What, you hear for a month, are you?

45:54.848 --> 45:56.428
Looks like it.
- No.

45:58.644 --> 45:59.657
It is, it's small.
