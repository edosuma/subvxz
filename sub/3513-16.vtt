WEBVTT

00:01.034 --> 00:02.206
Previously on Grimm.

00:02.769 --> 00:03.839
Can I buy you dinner?

00:03.969 --> 00:05.040
Sure, sounds great.

00:05.271 --> 00:06.682
So, how are things going
with our detective?

00:07.107 --> 00:08.381
He's not interested in me.

00:08.441 --> 00:10.284
You know how to make
yourself irresistible.

00:10.777 --> 00:11.778
I do.

00:11.845 --> 00:13.256
Well, the sooner the better.

00:13.313 --> 00:15.520
Blood of the deceived.

00:16.583 --> 00:17.857
I was doing some baking.

00:18.218 --> 00:19.788
Now, don't go giving those away.

00:19.953 --> 00:21.489
I made them just for you.

00:22.122 --> 00:23.328
Cookie.

00:37.971 --> 00:39.951
- You got the Burroughs report?
- Gave it to me.

00:40.073 --> 00:41.450
And the autopsy on
Clyde Harrington?

00:41.508 --> 00:42.612
It's not coming till Monday.

00:42.675 --> 00:45.212
What about ballistics? Nick. Go.

00:46.146 --> 00:48.148
The wheels of justice
will keep turning,

00:48.381 --> 00:49.689
at least for one weekend.

00:49.749 --> 00:50.921
Right.

00:51.751 --> 00:53.560
Okay, I'm going. Good.

00:59.225 --> 01:00.260
You're not leaving.

01:06.232 --> 01:07.802
And what if she says no?

01:08.334 --> 01:12.282
She's not going to say
no to a romantic weekend.

01:16.309 --> 01:18.516
Oh, man. This is it.
You're bringing it.

01:18.945 --> 01:20.515
I can't believe it.

01:21.014 --> 01:23.858
You're finally taking the big
leap in front of the bus.

01:24.350 --> 01:25.624
Yeah, I'm thinking, uh...

01:25.685 --> 01:27.255
Yeah, maybe dinner tomorrow night,

01:27.353 --> 01:30.391
someplace quiet, romantic...

01:30.523 --> 01:31.797
Nick, take it from me.

01:32.092 --> 01:33.969
The where doesn't matter
as much as the who.

01:35.428 --> 01:37.032
Well, if you need me... I won't.

01:37.197 --> 01:40.041
I wrote down the number of the
place I'm staying, right there.

01:40.934 --> 01:44.381
"Whispering Pines,
for the rest of your life."

01:46.072 --> 01:47.176
Will you get the hell out of here?

01:47.240 --> 01:50.653
Yes, I'm going, okay? Goodbye,
you're gonna miss me.

01:50.844 --> 01:54.189
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,
arrivederci.

02:04.858 --> 02:05.859
Hey, Robin.

02:05.925 --> 02:06.926
Where are you?

02:07.927 --> 02:09.372
I'm sorry, my car just broke down.

02:09.429 --> 02:11.204
I can't stay here any longer.

02:12.198 --> 02:13.541
I'm waiting for a tow.

02:13.967 --> 02:15.537
We'll have to do it tomorrow.

02:15.602 --> 02:18.606
Tomorrow? I... I was barely
able to get out today.

02:18.738 --> 02:20.240
If... If he finds out...

02:20.406 --> 02:22.283
I know. I'm doing everything I can.

02:22.475 --> 02:25.922
Okay, tomorrow, but please
promise me you'll be here, okay?

02:26.479 --> 02:28.049
I don't have much time left.

02:28.114 --> 02:29.252
I will do my best.

02:45.165 --> 02:46.872
Any big plans for tonight?

02:47.634 --> 02:49.910
Um, no. You?

02:50.703 --> 02:54.344
You bet. Gonna curl up on
that couch with my cat Samson,

02:54.507 --> 02:56.578
watch The Apprentice marathon
and have a bite to eat.

02:56.643 --> 02:59.522
Another badass
Portland Friday night.

03:00.213 --> 03:01.851
You got it.

03:37.951 --> 03:39.897
Robin.

03:40.787 --> 03:42.858
You know it's not safe
for you to be outside.

03:42.922 --> 03:45.869
I... I just wanted some air.

04:01.407 --> 04:02.442
It's time to eat.

04:02.976 --> 04:04.421
No.

04:05.144 --> 04:06.680
No, please.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.222
Come on, you know
how important it is

04:12.318 --> 04:14.059
for you to get your
vitamins in your condition.

05:22.455 --> 05:23.991
You sure you know
where we're going?

05:24.190 --> 05:26.602
We're looking for
Pine Meadows Drive.

05:27.593 --> 05:29.470
The house has a name.
It's called Owl's Nest.

05:39.505 --> 05:40.848
This is where we're staying?

05:41.007 --> 05:42.611
No. Good.

05:42.675 --> 05:43.676
Then why are we here?

05:43.810 --> 05:46.620
Oh, this is where I stop
to ask where we're staying.

05:46.679 --> 05:48.022
Be right back.

05:56.689 --> 05:58.362
Hey. Can I help you? Uh, yeah.

05:58.424 --> 06:00.597
I'm Nick Burkhardt.
Uh, sorry to bother you.

06:00.993 --> 06:03.030
I'm staying at a house
called The Owl's Nest.

06:03.196 --> 06:06.370
It's on, uh, Pine... Pine Meadow Drive.
Yeah, you've arrived.

06:06.466 --> 06:07.843
Sorry, there was a drunk driver

06:07.900 --> 06:09.106
who knocked down the
sign last weekend.

06:09.235 --> 06:10.976
Ah.

06:11.337 --> 06:12.816
Robin?

06:16.342 --> 06:18.049
Uh, sorry,
in the middle of cooking.

06:18.745 --> 06:21.351
Uh, the house is just
up the road there.

06:23.549 --> 06:25.028
Okay.

06:25.518 --> 06:27.623
Yeah, thanks. No problem.

06:41.534 --> 06:42.877
Damn it, Robin.

06:42.969 --> 06:44.505
You know what we're
gonna have to do now.

06:52.845 --> 06:54.415
It's just up the road.

06:54.647 --> 06:57.491
And for the record, I was not lost.

06:57.850 --> 06:59.830
Drunk driver hit the post.

07:03.289 --> 07:04.791
Hey, you okay?

07:06.325 --> 07:08.965
I get a creepy feeling
from that place.

07:10.696 --> 07:14.644
Well, fortunately,
we're not staying there.

07:35.455 --> 07:38.459
Oh, my God, look at this place!

07:42.962 --> 07:44.942
Aw.

07:45.765 --> 07:48.439
Wow. It's a lot of wood.

07:48.668 --> 07:50.545
You don't like it. No, I love it.

07:50.736 --> 07:53.376
I would love an igloo with you.

07:53.940 --> 07:55.112
Mmm.

08:28.474 --> 08:30.181
Hi, this is Adalind.

08:30.243 --> 08:31.779
Sorry I'm not here
to take your call.

08:31.978 --> 08:34.356
Please leave a message
and I'll call you back.

09:12.718 --> 09:13.856
Ooh!

09:17.189 --> 09:19.726
Wow. Well put.

09:20.893 --> 09:22.804
Gonna get some glasses. Okay.

09:25.965 --> 09:27.876
Robin!

09:28.200 --> 09:29.270
Get inside!

09:31.504 --> 09:32.505
Nick?

09:32.805 --> 09:35.183
Oh, you got to do something.

09:35.875 --> 09:37.980
What's wrong? Down at the house,
they're having a huge fight,

09:38.044 --> 09:40.547
and he just grabbed her
and dragged her inside.

09:40.613 --> 09:41.683
Oh, wait, wait. How do you know?

09:41.747 --> 09:43.249
I just saw it.

09:43.849 --> 09:45.351
Are you sure? Yes.

09:46.118 --> 09:47.688
All right.

09:47.787 --> 09:49.926
I'm gonna call the local police.

09:50.523 --> 09:52.594
If there's trouble down there,
they might already know about it,

09:52.658 --> 09:54.899
and if they don't, they should.

09:58.297 --> 10:00.743
Yeah, this is Nick Burkhardt,
I want to report a domestic disturbance

10:00.833 --> 10:02.972
at 1800 Pine Meadows Drive.

10:03.502 --> 10:04.913
Thank you.

10:05.271 --> 10:07.148
Hey.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.317
Sheriff's on his way.

10:14.180 --> 10:17.127
No. No, please.

10:17.350 --> 10:18.988
No more. Sorry, baby,

10:19.051 --> 10:20.826
but it's got to be done.

11:10.202 --> 11:11.272
Can I help you?

11:12.304 --> 11:13.305
You can help yourself.

11:13.472 --> 11:15.008
What?

11:17.443 --> 11:19.047
You can get in the car,
you can drive away,

11:19.111 --> 11:20.351
and you can never come back.

11:21.347 --> 11:22.621
All right.
Hey, pal, I don't know...

11:25.217 --> 11:26.696
I'm a cop.

11:27.987 --> 11:30.433
And I do not repeat myself.

12:10.596 --> 12:15.511
We received an emergency call about a
domestic dispute at this residence.

12:16.602 --> 12:17.945
May I come inside?

12:22.274 --> 12:24.845
It looks like the Sheriff's
got it from here.

12:29.081 --> 12:31.960
I was so excited to be
getting out of Portland,

12:32.952 --> 12:34.863
but somehow... I don't know.

12:34.920 --> 12:37.764
Does it feel like
trouble is following us?

12:39.725 --> 12:41.329
Well, I don't know. Maybe.

12:42.762 --> 12:44.298
Yeah.

12:44.997 --> 12:46.567
Trouble again.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.872
Maybe we should talk about this.

12:51.370 --> 12:52.440
Talk about what?

12:58.310 --> 13:00.790
The stuff that's been
happening lately.

13:02.581 --> 13:03.582
Run!

13:06.118 --> 13:07.461
Who comes for her?

13:10.156 --> 13:12.830
Yeah, it's been a lot.

13:12.925 --> 13:14.233
Yeah.

13:14.460 --> 13:16.531
And we haven't talked about it.
Not really.

13:16.595 --> 13:18.836
Listen, Juliette, listen to me.

13:20.966 --> 13:23.105
All that stuff is gonna calm down.

13:28.307 --> 13:29.547
I don't believe it.

13:30.042 --> 13:31.214
What?

13:34.814 --> 13:36.953
Why isn't he arresting that animal?

13:38.918 --> 13:40.795
If there's no obvious
signs of assault...

13:40.853 --> 13:42.924
So what, this sheriff's just
going to ignore the whole thing

13:42.988 --> 13:44.558
and pretend like it never happened?

13:44.757 --> 13:46.031
If the wife doesn't press charges,

13:46.091 --> 13:47.468
there's nothing we can do.

13:49.195 --> 13:51.869
Maybe she'll press
charges next time.

13:51.931 --> 13:54.138
Maybe next time she'll be dead.

13:57.636 --> 14:01.379
Hey. Look. I know
it's a lousy answer.

14:01.440 --> 14:03.010
I wish I had better one,
but I don't.

14:03.909 --> 14:05.650
We did everything we could.

14:10.916 --> 14:13.362
It doesn't feel like it was enough.

14:32.504 --> 14:35.451
How'd it go? He threatened me.

14:35.507 --> 14:37.453
If I stayed longer, I don't
know what he would have done.

14:37.643 --> 14:39.054
Then it's going well.

14:39.478 --> 14:41.048
Is there anything
else I can do, sir?

14:41.480 --> 14:42.686
I'll let you know.

14:43.115 --> 14:44.856
Thank you for giving
me this opportunity.

14:46.285 --> 14:48.925
You're welcome. Good night.

15:01.166 --> 15:02.167
Hello?

15:02.234 --> 15:03.975
Hey, Monroe. It's Nick.

15:04.937 --> 15:06.780
Nick... It's 2:30.

15:07.339 --> 15:08.579
Yeah, I know. I'm sorry.

15:08.707 --> 15:10.880
I have a Bikram class at 6:00 a.m.,

15:10.943 --> 15:14.186
and hot yoga on too-little sleep
is how groin pulls happen.

15:14.546 --> 15:16.389
Aren't you supposed
to be on vacation?

15:16.448 --> 15:18.758
Yeah. I am.

15:18.817 --> 15:20.728
But you need my help.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.091
Well, I can't exactly
bring the trailer with me.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.159
All right. I get it.

15:26.458 --> 15:27.801
What do you got?

15:27.893 --> 15:30.203
All right, I got a cat.
It's not a lion or a tiger,

15:30.262 --> 15:32.299
but it's not a housecat either.
It's something in-between.

15:32.431 --> 15:34.604
Like an alley cat? Yeah.

15:34.967 --> 15:39.245
Klaustreich. Total jerks.

15:39.371 --> 15:41.977
Women love them,
but it never ends well.

15:42.207 --> 15:43.481
Isn't that always the way?

15:43.609 --> 15:44.815
I don't know.

15:44.977 --> 15:48.481
This could be a, uh,
spousal situation.

15:48.914 --> 15:50.484
No surprise there.

15:50.549 --> 15:52.290
Molly, my girlfriend
from high school,

15:52.351 --> 15:53.625
left me for a Klaustreich,

15:53.686 --> 15:55.893
so I might be a wee bit
biled up about them.

15:56.422 --> 15:59.198
He told her he loved her.
He got her pregnant,

15:59.591 --> 16:01.901
she ended up delivering
his litter at prom.

16:03.329 --> 16:04.865
Her parents were not thrilled.

16:05.130 --> 16:07.474
Well, I hate to say it,
but getting pregnant in high school

16:07.533 --> 16:08.944
isn't exactly unheard of.

16:09.068 --> 16:10.775
Well, maybe not that part,

16:11.503 --> 16:13.346
but when she told her
folks who the father was,

16:13.405 --> 16:14.679
they went to the cops.

16:15.174 --> 16:17.711
He paid her a little visit
before he skipped town.

16:18.677 --> 16:22.284
As a good-bye, he slashed her face.

16:22.448 --> 16:24.018
Oh. I hope they caught him

16:25.217 --> 16:28.721
Well, they didn't,

16:30.889 --> 16:33.426
but somebody did. Oh.

16:34.526 --> 16:36.335
All right, well,
sorry for calling so late.

16:36.395 --> 16:37.430
Hey, don't worry about it.

16:37.596 --> 16:39.234
Especially if it's
about a Klaustreich.

16:40.132 --> 16:42.203
Sleep with one eye open.

16:47.840 --> 16:49.615
Now, I have the whole day planned.

16:50.275 --> 16:52.346
Well, it starts with a trip Tell me

16:52.411 --> 16:54.413
into beautiful downtown
Whispering Pines.

16:54.513 --> 16:55.958
Okay. Where, uh,

16:56.015 --> 16:59.019
you can drag me through as many
antique shops as you want to

16:59.084 --> 17:02.156
until I pass out or
beg you for mercy.

17:02.221 --> 17:04.258
Really, you want to do that?
Well, not really.

17:05.624 --> 17:08.627
But I need to pick up some
groceries for our special dinner.

17:08.694 --> 17:10.731
Ooh, sounds intriguing. Mmm.

17:11.563 --> 17:13.201
You have no idea.

17:14.532 --> 17:15.568
Mmm.

17:21.040 --> 17:22.541
6:00, bring the money.

17:23.442 --> 17:25.615
Can we do it later?
It'll be hard for me

17:25.676 --> 17:27.554
to get out after what
happened yesterday.

17:27.613 --> 17:29.149
Look, Robin, I'm taking
a real chance here.

17:29.214 --> 17:31.091
The sooner we get out,
the further you'll get.

17:36.455 --> 17:37.490
Excuse me.

17:39.825 --> 17:41.634
Hi. I'm Juliette.
I'm actually staying

17:41.693 --> 17:43.195
at the house up on the
hill behind yours.

17:43.929 --> 17:45.374
Oh.

17:45.497 --> 17:46.703
I'm Robin.

17:47.032 --> 17:50.104
You're lucky you live in
such a beautiful town.

17:50.269 --> 17:51.646
We don't get away from
Portland that much.

17:51.737 --> 17:54.115
I'm a vet, so weekends are bad,
and Nick's a cop,

17:54.173 --> 17:56.449
so he's busy pretty
much all the time.

17:57.009 --> 17:58.886
Your husband's a police officer?

17:58.944 --> 18:03.051
Detective actually,
and he's not my husband.

18:03.515 --> 18:05.085
Not yet, anyway. Oh.

18:05.484 --> 18:07.191
Excuse me.

18:41.320 --> 18:43.425
It's okay. I got it.

18:43.589 --> 18:45.694
It's okay. Happens all the time.

19:06.545 --> 19:08.218
Robin...

19:08.614 --> 19:10.355
I'm sure this is
none of my business,

19:10.449 --> 19:11.689
but if you're in
some kind of trouble,

19:11.783 --> 19:13.592
or you need help of any kind...

19:13.952 --> 19:15.363
Robin.

19:17.956 --> 19:19.026
It's time to go.

19:57.963 --> 20:00.500
Look, I really appreciate you
helping me out with all this.

20:00.566 --> 20:03.775
Well, you never know when I
might need a discount on...

20:05.037 --> 20:07.074
Tincture of prickle poppy?

20:07.773 --> 20:10.686
Yeah, that's for, um,
romantic stamina.

20:11.176 --> 20:12.814
Oh.Well...

20:13.445 --> 20:14.480
No wonder I didn't
know what it was.

20:19.651 --> 20:20.789
Found something.

20:22.120 --> 20:24.361
Oh, maybe it's money.
It's not money.

20:24.556 --> 20:28.094
Passports from Brazil,
Canada... And Germany.

20:29.061 --> 20:30.131
Wonder who they belong to.

20:31.697 --> 20:32.732
Isn't that your brother?

20:34.333 --> 20:36.404
In all of them?

20:37.035 --> 20:38.343
Yeah, with different names.

20:38.537 --> 20:40.312
What was he, a spy or something?

20:40.672 --> 20:42.242
I have no idea.

20:49.414 --> 20:51.553
Hey, Nick, I thought a
vacation for you kind of meant,

20:51.617 --> 20:54.097
you know, vacation for me too.

20:54.453 --> 20:56.899
Look, I'm sorry. You know, this wasn't
part of my weekend plans either.

20:56.955 --> 20:59.401
Hey, how was hot yoga?
You pull a groin or anything?

20:59.625 --> 21:01.400
My groin is fine. Thank you.

21:01.627 --> 21:03.197
All right, I'll make this fast,

21:03.462 --> 21:04.873
but it is a weird one.

21:05.230 --> 21:06.732
Some kind of bird-like creature.

21:06.865 --> 21:09.004
Big golden eyes, uh,
golden plumage...

21:09.067 --> 21:11.047
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Is this a joke?

21:11.103 --> 21:12.309
No joke.

21:12.371 --> 21:14.612
That sounds like a Seltenvogel,
if they weren't extinct.

21:14.806 --> 21:16.717
A Seltenvogel? Sounds like it.

21:16.842 --> 21:18.617
Are you with someone? Yeah,
I'm with Rosalie.

21:18.677 --> 21:19.712
I'm helping her out in the shop,

21:19.778 --> 21:21.382
but let's get back
to the Seltenvogel.

21:21.446 --> 21:23.551
In ancient times,
they were highly-valued,

21:23.615 --> 21:24.821
usually kept prisoner, you know,

21:24.883 --> 21:27.261
like a concubine or a parakeet.

21:27.486 --> 21:29.625
Well, what made them so valuable?
Once in their life,

21:29.955 --> 21:35.667
a Seltenvogel produces this
kind of large, glandular thing.

21:35.727 --> 21:37.536
I think it's called an Unbezahlbar.

21:38.830 --> 21:40.901
Easy for you to say.
She thinks it's called an...

21:40.966 --> 21:42.172
Unbezahlbar.

21:42.301 --> 21:44.247
Unbezahlbar. My brother has a book.

21:45.671 --> 21:47.514
Hang on, we're looking.

21:48.073 --> 21:49.950
Here it is.

21:53.378 --> 21:55.051
- Oh, here.
- Okay.

21:55.180 --> 21:57.182
Uh, it is a dense mineral deposit

21:57.282 --> 21:59.319
which grows in the throat sack.

21:59.484 --> 22:01.259
It develops something like an egg.

22:03.989 --> 22:05.297
Anyway, um,

22:05.390 --> 22:07.996
yeah, if the stone gets too big,
it needs to be delivered,

22:08.060 --> 22:09.630
and the trick is
getting it out intact,

22:09.728 --> 22:13.005
because if it's damaged,
it's, you know, worthless.

22:13.365 --> 22:15.208
Okay, but what made
them so valuable?

22:15.267 --> 22:17.269
Well, it's unbelievably rare,

22:17.336 --> 22:19.942
for one thing, but it's also
supposed to be mostly gold,

22:20.005 --> 22:21.541
if you believe in
that kind of thing.

22:21.606 --> 22:23.745
What, and I'm guessing a
Klaustreich would know this too.

22:24.209 --> 22:26.348
Oh, man, this is the woman
who's with the Klaustreich?

22:26.511 --> 22:27.683
Yeah. Listen.

22:27.879 --> 22:30.257
If he's anything like the guy
I went to high school with,

22:30.349 --> 22:31.623
as soon as he gets what he wants,

22:31.750 --> 22:33.525
she is going to be
in big trouble, man.

22:33.618 --> 22:36.064
And when I say big trouble,
I mean she's gonna get plucked.

22:36.121 --> 22:37.896
Okay? Big time. Thanks.

23:20.232 --> 23:21.472
You scared me.

23:21.967 --> 23:23.640
That's a compliment,
coming from you.

23:24.002 --> 23:25.879
What are you doing here?

23:26.938 --> 23:28.576
It appears Detective Griffin is

23:29.007 --> 23:31.317
taking favorably to your cookies.

23:31.610 --> 23:34.989
He's left a dozen voice-mail
messages as of this morning,

23:35.347 --> 23:38.089
if you call that a response.

23:38.683 --> 23:41.163
And he threatened your
visitor last night too.

23:41.753 --> 23:44.461
I wish he'd done more
than threaten him.

23:44.523 --> 23:46.696
Do you realize that Peter
suggested that we sleep together

23:46.758 --> 23:49.364
to ensure our authenticity?

23:49.694 --> 23:51.799
He's lucky I let him
leave in one piece.

23:53.064 --> 23:54.543
The next time Griffin calls,

23:55.734 --> 23:57.270
I want you to answer.

23:57.536 --> 23:59.573
It's time to move this up a notch.

24:02.073 --> 24:05.919
I hope you realize how
dangerous this is...

24:05.977 --> 24:07.320
For me.

24:09.080 --> 24:10.650
You can handle it.

24:11.149 --> 24:12.924
Let's hope so.

24:13.718 --> 24:16.324
Just be who you aren't.

24:29.401 --> 24:32.143
I can't believe you remember
what we had on our first date.

24:32.437 --> 24:33.541
How could I forget that?

24:33.605 --> 24:35.551
That was the most expensive
date I've ever had in my life.

24:35.774 --> 24:37.651
Not if you add in what
happened afterward.

24:37.709 --> 24:39.689
Ooh. Yeah, or after that.

24:46.251 --> 24:48.026
She has your card,
she knows she can call us.

24:48.086 --> 24:49.394
Right.

24:52.557 --> 24:54.764
We did everything we could do.

24:56.127 --> 24:57.663
You're right. Mmm.

24:57.863 --> 25:00.207
We did, now back to us.

25:30.695 --> 25:33.676
You should try the tea. It's new.

25:34.733 --> 25:35.939
I'm not so thirsty.

25:42.641 --> 25:44.086
Hey.

25:45.143 --> 25:46.213
What, right now?

25:47.612 --> 25:49.819
Uh, no. Okay, no.

25:49.881 --> 25:51.918
I'll, uh... I'll be right over.

25:53.018 --> 25:54.156
Mmm-hmm.

25:56.221 --> 25:58.030
Who was that? It was Kevin.
He needs a hand.

25:58.089 --> 26:00.729
He, uh... He hit a deer.
His car's in a ditch.

26:00.792 --> 26:04.569
He's waiting for, uh, a tow,
and needs a ride home.

26:07.098 --> 26:09.408
Got no idea how long
this is gonna take.

26:09.467 --> 26:10.946
Okay.

26:30.889 --> 26:33.096
You do the crabs,
I'll finish chopping.

26:33.158 --> 26:34.432
Ooh, thanks.

26:43.868 --> 26:45.347
Hey. What?

26:48.039 --> 26:50.144
Gotta melt the butter. Right.

26:59.584 --> 27:01.860
Well, that's weird.
Glad you said it first.

27:04.956 --> 27:07.459
She didn't call.
Maybe she couldn't.

27:08.893 --> 27:10.998
What about the crab? It can wait.

27:11.830 --> 27:15.642
Okay. I'll, uh, just check
to see if she's okay.

27:16.568 --> 27:18.070
You want me to go with you? No, no.

27:18.136 --> 27:20.639
If it's something serious,
it's better you stay here.

27:20.805 --> 27:22.182
I know. Go.

27:31.549 --> 27:32.994
Hello? Adalind.

27:33.251 --> 27:35.060
Yes ?

27:35.153 --> 27:36.632
Uh, it's Hank.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.364
I guess I just expected to
get your voice-mail again.

27:40.759 --> 27:44.172
I've been completely off the radar.
Work's been crazy.

27:44.229 --> 27:45.833
Eighteen-hour days. I'm so sorry.

27:45.897 --> 27:47.706
I was actually just
about to call you back.

27:47.766 --> 27:49.871
That's okay. Really.

27:50.869 --> 27:52.177
It's just good to hear your voice.

27:53.605 --> 27:55.983
It's good to hear your voice too.

27:59.244 --> 28:03.021
I was thinking, uh,
maybe we can see each other.

28:03.982 --> 28:05.086
I mean, whenever is good for you

28:05.183 --> 28:06.992
Mmm...

28:07.252 --> 28:09.254
I'm free for dinner tomorrow night.

28:09.521 --> 28:12.297
Tomorrow. Perfect.

28:12.857 --> 28:15.565
Um, I'll pick a place
and call you back.

28:16.594 --> 28:17.595
How's 7:00 sound?

28:17.829 --> 28:20.503
Sounds lucky, can't wait.

28:41.519 --> 28:42.623
Robin?

28:43.822 --> 28:45.859
Hey, hurry up, we got to go.

29:08.847 --> 29:09.985
Hi.

29:15.820 --> 29:17.561
He was on time,
but you're a little too late.

29:18.957 --> 29:21.369
You killed him. No.

29:21.493 --> 29:22.767
You killed him.

29:22.827 --> 29:25.000
You should never have
involved him in our business.

30:15.046 --> 30:16.525
Sheriff Munson. Sheriff.

30:17.215 --> 30:18.956
Detective Burkhardt, Portland PD.

30:19.284 --> 30:21.195
I'm the one who called 911
about the Steinkellners.

30:21.953 --> 30:23.432
What's the problem?

30:23.788 --> 30:24.858
There's been a homicide.

30:25.790 --> 30:27.770
Homicide? Are you kidding me?

30:27.859 --> 30:31.363
No. Victim's name is Gary Cardero.

30:31.429 --> 30:33.739
At least I think that's him,
he's torn up pretty bad.

30:34.132 --> 30:35.907
Where are you?
I'm on what looks to be

30:35.967 --> 30:38.675
a forest service road about
a mile or a half-mile

30:38.770 --> 30:40.181
behind the Steinkellners' house.

30:40.705 --> 30:41.740
I'm coming out.

30:59.057 --> 31:00.297
Hey! Get out!

31:00.358 --> 31:02.463
Get... Robin! Get out!

31:02.794 --> 31:03.932
This is your fault!

31:05.997 --> 31:07.840
Yeah?

31:07.899 --> 31:10.072
Where are you? I just saw him
driving her up to the house.

31:10.134 --> 31:12.410
I'm on my way back. Just stay
in the house until I get there.

31:15.273 --> 31:16.274
Robin!

31:18.676 --> 31:20.155
Get inside!

31:25.216 --> 31:27.526
Timothy, please. I can't.

31:27.585 --> 31:29.223
We've already done this once today.

31:29.287 --> 31:31.893
Once is never enough when
you're expecting, sweetie.

31:33.157 --> 31:34.261
Open up.

31:37.662 --> 31:40.336
Okay. Okay, let's put a little...

31:41.232 --> 31:43.405
A little weight on that baby.

31:47.772 --> 31:48.910
Open.

32:13.131 --> 32:14.132
Turn it off.

32:18.636 --> 32:20.741
Yeah, you're a Klaustreich
Now turn it off.

32:53.638 --> 32:54.844
It's gonna be okay.

32:54.973 --> 32:56.247
It's gonna be okay.
You're gonna be okay.

32:58.042 --> 32:59.112
I'm gonna get you out of here.

33:06.784 --> 33:08.320
Oh, my God, you poor thing.

33:08.386 --> 33:10.263
What did he do to you?

33:10.321 --> 33:12.358
He told me he loved me.

33:16.294 --> 33:17.466
Let me get you a glass of water.

33:19.530 --> 33:20.531
You're a Grimm.

33:21.265 --> 33:22.403
Um, yeah.

33:22.567 --> 33:24.342
Why are you helping me?

33:24.402 --> 33:25.972
Uh, can we talk about this later?

33:26.270 --> 33:27.874
Okay. Yeah.

33:28.239 --> 33:30.014
Look, I called the Sheriff,
he's on his way.

33:30.074 --> 33:32.247
What? Yeah, he's pulling
up to the house right now.

33:32.310 --> 33:34.290
Oh...

33:35.646 --> 33:38.627
The Sheriff is Tim's cousin.
He... He knows all about this.

33:38.683 --> 33:40.287
He's part of it.

33:48.826 --> 33:49.827
Where is she?

33:50.294 --> 33:51.796
The guy from up the hill took her.

33:51.863 --> 33:53.274
He was here. He had a gun.

33:53.398 --> 33:55.105
He's a cop. He's a Grimm.

33:56.000 --> 33:57.240
He wants her for himself.

33:57.435 --> 33:58.675
That's not gonna happen.

34:02.507 --> 34:03.884
All right, we need to
get you out of here.

34:03.941 --> 34:05.045
No, you don't understand.

34:05.109 --> 34:06.816
There's only one road
and they'll be on it.

34:07.478 --> 34:08.980
They're coming.

34:11.748 --> 34:13.558
Go after her.

34:15.219 --> 34:16.219
But what about you?

34:16.286 --> 34:18.358
I'll sneak outside and
call state police.

34:18.422 --> 34:20.527
You've gotta help her, Nick.
Oh, Juliette.

34:20.591 --> 34:22.628
I know, but this is why you bought
it for me in the first place.

34:22.693 --> 34:23.933
Now go.

34:42.612 --> 34:43.784
Car's still here!

34:44.782 --> 34:46.125
They gotta be around
here somewhere.

34:46.184 --> 34:47.788
Not gonna get far with
her in her condition.

34:50.554 --> 34:52.228
Robin!

35:00.498 --> 35:01.977
Robin!

35:12.110 --> 35:13.555
Oh, man.

35:14.745 --> 35:15.917
Robin...

35:16.380 --> 35:17.620
I've gotta get you out of here.

35:18.082 --> 35:19.254
It's time.

35:19.484 --> 35:21.157
Oh. I don't know how to do this.

35:22.220 --> 35:24.530
You have to...

35:24.589 --> 35:25.863
Take it out.

35:27.191 --> 35:28.727
Okay.

35:39.537 --> 35:41.107
Hello? Rosalie?

35:41.172 --> 35:43.174
Hey, Nick Burkhardt here.
I need your help.

35:43.374 --> 35:44.375
What's wrong?

35:44.442 --> 35:49.118
Well, I'm with Robin,
the Seltenvogel.

35:49.180 --> 35:50.818
Nick, you need to get
that stone out of her

35:50.882 --> 35:52.054
before it cuts off her airway.

35:52.116 --> 35:54.096
Yeah, I know,
but how? Is that Nick?

35:54.452 --> 35:55.760
He called you? You called her?

35:55.820 --> 35:57.697
Can you guys do this later?
That girl needs help.

35:57.989 --> 35:59.525
She says I need to take it out.

35:59.590 --> 36:01.695
You grab the book. No, you... No,
you need to cut it out of her.

36:01.759 --> 36:02.794
Do you have a knife?

36:02.994 --> 36:04.496
Uh, yeah, I do.

36:05.296 --> 36:06.639
Okay, right here. Oh, boy.

36:06.964 --> 36:08.466
Okay, the cut should
be made vertically

36:08.533 --> 36:11.275
along the widest point
of the Unbezahlbar.

36:11.469 --> 36:13.642
The... The skin
should be pretty tight

36:13.771 --> 36:15.978
so you just need to press the knife

36:16.040 --> 36:18.953
through the flesh until you feel
the hard surface of the stone.

36:19.377 --> 36:21.550
Okay.

36:31.255 --> 36:32.393
Nick? Update.

36:32.456 --> 36:33.662
Uh, a little busy here.

36:34.058 --> 36:36.129
Oh, it says be really careful
not to cut the jugular.

36:36.494 --> 36:37.529
Uh, not helping.

36:37.595 --> 36:39.768
You want to get close,
but not too close.

36:40.164 --> 36:41.541
How will I know if I'm too close?

36:41.599 --> 36:43.374
Dude, you'll know. Tons of blood.

36:43.501 --> 36:45.640
Trust me, it's not pretty.
I've been there.

36:46.337 --> 36:48.476
Okay. Okay, okay.
I think I'm... I'm done.

36:48.539 --> 36:51.076
All right, now slip
your hands into the cut

36:51.309 --> 36:54.290
and gently detach the Unbezahlbar

36:54.545 --> 36:56.752
from the Faserig membrane,
holding it in place.

36:57.048 --> 36:59.585
You should feel a slight
pop when it separates.

37:05.856 --> 37:07.199
Okay.

37:08.092 --> 37:09.093
Okay, it popped.

37:09.193 --> 37:10.695
Okay, that's great. Just, um...

37:10.795 --> 37:13.503
Just simply lift it up and out.

37:14.065 --> 37:15.601
Oh, God.

37:22.473 --> 37:24.077
Oh.

37:28.279 --> 37:29.485
Oh.

37:32.750 --> 37:34.388
Oh, wow.

37:35.853 --> 37:36.854
How is she?

37:42.326 --> 37:43.498
She...

37:44.829 --> 37:46.467
Seems to be breathing a lot better.

37:46.697 --> 37:48.108
I think she's gonna be okay.

37:48.165 --> 37:50.076
Nice goin', dude.

37:50.668 --> 37:53.774
Hey, call me later, will you,
when this all calms down, okay?

37:57.742 --> 37:59.517
Wow.

38:01.245 --> 38:02.519
I think this is yours.

38:03.314 --> 38:04.850
I don't want it.

38:06.951 --> 38:08.396
I never did.

38:11.389 --> 38:12.766
Real nice job you did there.

38:13.858 --> 38:16.134
Yeah, saved us a lot of trouble.

38:22.300 --> 38:24.780
From what I understand,
if this thing breaks,

38:28.406 --> 38:30.408
it's worthless. Okay,
and so are you, if you're dead.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.277
All we want is the stone.

38:33.344 --> 38:35.449
Yeah? How about a little catch?

38:35.513 --> 38:37.789
No, no, no... Now, take it easy.

38:38.215 --> 38:40.627
Look, we're not greedy,
we can cut you in.

38:40.985 --> 38:42.965
Do you have any idea how
much that is worth to us?

38:43.020 --> 38:44.158
Oh, really?

38:46.424 --> 38:47.596
Whoops.

38:47.925 --> 38:48.960
Are you insane?

38:49.327 --> 38:52.001
Well, I'm in the woods, I just cut
a golden egg out of a girl's neck.

38:52.063 --> 38:53.064
You tell me.

38:56.500 --> 38:57.979
Hey, Sheriff.

39:04.075 --> 39:05.713
Juliette.

39:07.144 --> 39:08.623
Keep the gun on him.

39:40.544 --> 39:43.491
Well, you know what they say, Tim.

39:45.082 --> 39:49.224
In order to make an omelet,
you got to break a few eggs.

39:53.624 --> 39:55.501
Okay, look,
I know that this weekend

39:55.559 --> 39:56.867
didn't turn out the way I planned.

39:57.428 --> 40:00.102
And, uh, I think
the thing of it is,

40:00.631 --> 40:02.406
you kind of have to make
your own perfect moments.

40:02.900 --> 40:04.038
So...

40:10.107 --> 40:11.916
Juliette, will you be my wife?

40:32.296 --> 40:33.366
I can't.

40:36.700 --> 40:39.806
I love you so much.

40:44.575 --> 40:47.613
And I really, really want
to marry you someday.

40:50.214 --> 40:51.318
But I can't right now.

40:51.649 --> 40:52.753
Because of what?
I'm a cop? Is that...

40:52.883 --> 40:54.419
It's not because of your job.

40:55.619 --> 40:57.257
It's you.

40:59.924 --> 41:02.700
I feel like you've been
keeping things from me.

41:02.760 --> 41:04.933
You've been so closed off.

41:06.697 --> 41:09.701
I know how hard Aunt
Marie's death was for you.

41:16.040 --> 41:19.920
But until you can let
me back in again,

41:21.912 --> 41:23.482
I can't say yes.

00:00.500 --> 00:02.000
