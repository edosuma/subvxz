WEBVTT

00:06.439 --> 00:07.507
Hey, guys!

00:07.507 --> 00:09.498
Four days until vacation week.
Where are we all going?

00:10.143 --> 00:12.668
Nowhere. We don't get next week off.

00:12.779 --> 00:14.981
We've got to load out the sets
and take them to storage.

00:14.981 --> 00:18.348
Then at night, I've got to drive around
Newark looking for my runaway daughter.

00:18.518 --> 00:19.485
Oh.

00:21.688 --> 00:23.523
Oh. What happened to your hand?

00:23.523 --> 00:26.981
Oh, I was trying out my spray tan
for my trip to St. Bartleby's next week.

00:27.160 --> 00:30.430
Oh, Miss Lemon, how could you do
that to your beautiful hands?

00:30.430 --> 00:33.833
With your flat, manly, milking thumbs
and your long, graceful knuckle hair --

00:33.833 --> 00:34.968
Thank you, Kenneth.

00:36.069 --> 00:38.765
Are you sick? Because I am not
getting sick before my trip.

00:39.272 --> 00:43.143
The place I go to has private beaches,
soft-serve ice cream machines,

00:43.143 --> 00:46.909
and, after the French custom,
people wear dark socks to the beach.

00:47.213 --> 00:50.483
It's the one thing I do for myself
every year. And I am going.

00:50.483 --> 00:52.610
I even bought a new swimsuit.

00:53.486 --> 00:54.487
What is that?

00:54.487 --> 00:56.489
It's called a "Tankoort", Cerie.

00:56.489 --> 00:58.024
You may have seen it in Us Weekly

00:58.024 --> 01:00.126
being worn by Dame Judi Dench...

01:00.126 --> 01:01.127
...'s mother.

01:02.395 --> 01:03.362
Kenneth?

01:03.963 --> 01:05.863
Don't worry, Miss Lemon.
I never get sick.

01:05.965 --> 01:07.592
I have the constitution of an ox.

01:09.035 --> 01:11.936
Oh, no! I must have ox fever!

01:12.305 --> 01:14.239
When did I walk barefoot near an ox?

01:14.340 --> 01:15.475
You have the flu.

01:15.475 --> 01:18.273
Go home. You are not ruining my vacation!

01:19.345 --> 01:23.338
Liz, wait. Did you get that
swim thing for your vacation?

01:23.950 --> 01:25.051
You know it's cancelled, right?

01:25.051 --> 01:26.814
No. What? Wait.
What are you talking about?

01:27.120 --> 01:29.179
The hotel was overbooked. I texted you.

01:29.589 --> 01:30.988
No. No, you didn't!

01:31.291 --> 01:33.193
Oh, I forgot to hit send.

01:33.193 --> 01:34.828
Just hold on a second.

01:34.828 --> 01:36.159
There you go.

01:38.000 --> 01:44.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

01:50.510 --> 01:52.910
I got a great reservation to
celebrate our first real date.

01:53.179 --> 01:54.305
Now, have you ever had sushi?

01:54.414 --> 01:57.577
I once had a very under-cooked
fish sandwich at a parade.

01:57.650 --> 01:58.617
I guess that counts.

01:59.219 --> 02:00.686
Oh, no. But...

02:00.954 --> 02:03.320
I can only stay for five minutes.

02:03.823 --> 02:05.017
I have to go back to work.

02:05.158 --> 02:06.523
I thought today was your day off.

02:06.626 --> 02:09.027
I have another patient on my off days.

02:09.027 --> 02:11.519
He's a sweet, old man
with advanced dementia.

02:11.998 --> 02:14.364
Totally disconnected from reality.

02:14.667 --> 02:16.970
Oh, that reminds me.
I owe Lou Dobbs a call.

02:16.970 --> 02:20.064
Elisa, are you telling me
that you work seven days a week?

02:20.240 --> 02:22.265
Yes. I have two jobs.

02:22.842 --> 02:24.944
That's what regular people do, you know?

02:24.944 --> 02:28.812
Especially those whose grandmothers
are addicted to online poker.

02:28.882 --> 02:31.484
Don't let that keep us apart.
When are you back with my mother?

02:31.484 --> 02:32.485
I'll cook you dinner.

02:32.485 --> 02:33.987
Jack...

02:33.987 --> 02:36.888
Your house... is my workplace.

02:36.990 --> 02:39.220
Plus, Colleen doesn't seem
to like that we're together.

02:39.292 --> 02:42.595
I hope you know she acts like that
because she hates every woman I like.

02:42.595 --> 02:44.297
It's not because you're a...

02:44.297 --> 02:46.765
...I'm sorry. What do you call yourself?

02:46.833 --> 02:47.834
A Puerto Rican.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.064
No, I know you can say that.
But what do I call you?

02:50.403 --> 02:51.370
A Puerto Rican.

02:51.604 --> 02:54.198
Wow. That does not sound right.

03:18.932 --> 03:21.901
Oh, Miss Lemon. Mr. Donaghy
wants to see you in the green room.

03:21.901 --> 03:23.630
Kenneth, why are you still here?

03:24.103 --> 03:26.435
Oh, don't worry about me. I'm "A-oh-boy."

03:26.573 --> 03:27.907
I should be going to the Caribbean.

03:27.907 --> 03:30.740
Instead, I'm stuck here with you
and a bunch of guys named Sully.

03:31.578 --> 03:32.545
Oh, Miss Lemon.

03:33.046 --> 03:35.571
Sully! Brett Favre, right?

03:40.386 --> 03:42.718
Jack, I need to ask you to drop your pants.

03:48.628 --> 03:49.856
That's it.

03:51.598 --> 03:52.565
Have a sucker.

03:54.000 --> 03:54.967
Lemon, there you are.

03:55.201 --> 03:56.361
Leo's giving out flu shots.

03:56.703 --> 03:58.762
Not my favorite part of the medical profession.

03:59.005 --> 04:01.040
My favorite part is attending executions.

04:01.040 --> 04:02.667
Can I ask you a question as a woman?

04:02.775 --> 04:03.776
Dr. Spaceman: You may, Jack.

04:03.776 --> 04:06.643
Are you going to alter your voice
or dress up in any way?

04:06.746 --> 04:07.747
Uh... Liz.

04:07.747 --> 04:08.714
Oh. Sorry.

04:08.881 --> 04:10.783
I don't know what to do about Elisa.

04:10.783 --> 04:12.648
She works all the time.

04:12.719 --> 04:14.320
You know she's a
second-generation Puerto Rican.

04:14.320 --> 04:15.719
Jack, you can't call her that!

04:15.822 --> 04:17.123
That's what I thought.

04:17.123 --> 04:20.149
With work and everything, it's
turning out to be complicated.

04:20.293 --> 04:22.284
You said the same thing about C.C.

04:23.029 --> 04:25.020
Count yourself lucky you're getting one of these.

04:25.231 --> 04:26.425
He only has five left.

04:26.599 --> 04:29.202
Lemon, I need you to tell me
who on your staff

04:29.202 --> 04:30.770
is important enough to get one.

04:30.770 --> 04:32.605
Hold on. You're rationing healthcare?

04:32.605 --> 04:33.606
That's not okay.

04:35.174 --> 04:38.278
Yes, Lemon. Important people
get better health care.

04:38.278 --> 04:40.213
They also get better restaurant reservations,

04:40.213 --> 04:41.271
bigger seats in planes --

04:41.381 --> 04:43.315
A more refined class of prostitute...

04:43.750 --> 04:45.615
For me, it's really
about the companionship.

04:45.852 --> 04:47.285
Like it or not, you're one of us now.

04:47.453 --> 04:48.588
One of the elite.

04:48.588 --> 04:50.857
No, I'm not. I am from White Haven, PA.

04:50.857 --> 04:53.359
My grandfather dug out the White Haven quarry,

04:53.359 --> 04:57.830
and my other grandfather filled it back in
with the sludge from the eraser factory.

04:57.830 --> 05:00.230
I am still way more like those people than you.

05:00.433 --> 05:01.834
And I don't want anything they don't get.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.131
Lemon, you don't want to get sick.

05:03.536 --> 05:05.902
It's not about that. It's about fairness.
I don't want the shot.

05:08.608 --> 05:11.668
When is modern science going to
find a cure for a woman's mouth?

05:15.214 --> 05:17.512
Jack. What are you doing here?

05:17.650 --> 05:20.653
Making this work.
I brought some dinner and Monopoly.

05:20.653 --> 05:23.952
We can have a fun, low-key night.
Unless I lose.

05:24.023 --> 05:25.158
That is sweet.

05:25.158 --> 05:27.285
But very inappropriate.

05:27.393 --> 05:28.587
Get in before somebody sees you.

05:29.729 --> 05:32.527
The agency would fire me
if they knew I was having guests.

05:33.833 --> 05:35.960
Who's going to tell them? Him?

05:36.569 --> 05:39.595
Hey, it's me. Matlock.
I need your help.

05:39.672 --> 05:40.934
Okay. Very funny, Jack.

05:41.107 --> 05:42.096
Elisa.

05:43.843 --> 05:45.105
You work so hard.

05:46.145 --> 05:48.581
Don't you think you deserve
some time for yourself?

05:48.581 --> 05:51.584
Of course I do. I've been living
in New York for 15 years,

05:51.584 --> 05:56.385
and I've never seen a Broadway play,
or been in a restaurant without a TV in it.

05:56.589 --> 06:00.025
Or had a romantic dinner
with a man in a suit.

06:00.226 --> 06:01.193
Ay.

06:01.527 --> 06:02.960
Okay, you can stay.

06:03.096 --> 06:06.793
But it's not all going to be fun and games.
Mr.Templeton's foot is still healing.

06:06.866 --> 06:09.494
Of course.
You do your job and I'll just...

06:12.305 --> 06:13.773
What is wrong with it?

06:13.773 --> 06:15.035
Is that a beak?

06:16.109 --> 06:17.098
- Yes!
- No.

06:17.176 --> 06:18.177
Yes!

06:18.177 --> 06:20.546
Liz, Tracy says Kauai
is more beautiful than Maui

06:20.546 --> 06:22.749
and keeps shouting
when I try to give my opinion,

06:22.749 --> 06:23.750
which is that...

06:23.750 --> 06:25.385
"La-la-la-la-la-la-la!"

06:25.385 --> 06:27.787
Maui is the wind surfing
capital of the world!

06:27.787 --> 06:29.948
Guys, come on.
We have to shoot these promos.

06:30.056 --> 06:32.650
Oh, my God. Jack gave you two flu shots?

06:32.725 --> 06:34.327
They said it was a flu shot.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.885
But I know it's really a truth serum.

06:36.028 --> 06:36.995
It's not a truth serum.

06:37.063 --> 06:39.725
Then why am I telling you
you look like Tootsie today?

06:40.566 --> 06:42.301
You two should be ashamed of yourselves.

06:42.301 --> 06:45.438
The crew is on death's door,
and you're arguing about Hawaii?

06:45.438 --> 06:48.305
If I were you, I'd be doing
something special to thank them.

06:49.208 --> 06:50.977
That would make us look pretty great.

06:50.977 --> 06:51.944
Yeah.

06:52.145 --> 06:55.281
Kenneth, I'm considering giving you
one of the remaining flushots.

06:55.281 --> 06:58.618
No need, sir.
It would be an honor to die at my post

06:58.618 --> 07:01.678
and be given the traditional
burial of a Parcell man.

07:01.921 --> 07:05.652
Wrapped in a Confederate Flag,
fried and fed to dogs.

07:07.794 --> 07:09.228
Are you ready for your shot?

07:09.228 --> 07:10.263
Never.

07:10.263 --> 07:12.365
Two-tiered health care is a crime.

07:12.365 --> 07:14.492
You know, in Cuba, everybody
gets equal healthcare.

07:14.700 --> 07:16.702
What a surprise.
You've seen the Michael Moore movie.

07:16.702 --> 07:20.440
Think again, Jack. I saw the trailer
when I went to see Alvin and the Chipmunks.

07:20.440 --> 07:22.442
But this flu shot rationing is baloney.

07:22.442 --> 07:24.910
If my crew can't get a shot,
I'm not getting a shot.

07:25.077 --> 07:26.044
Hey. You tell him, Liz!

07:26.345 --> 07:28.074
God bless you, crewman!

07:28.314 --> 07:29.615
We've got to fight the power!

07:30.650 --> 07:31.651
Oh, boy.

07:31.651 --> 07:33.175
Fight the powers that be!

07:34.620 --> 07:35.587
That's right!

07:35.688 --> 07:37.519
This makes me want to "shoop"!

07:37.890 --> 07:40.688
"Shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop, shoop!"

07:41.794 --> 07:44.024
Mr. Jordan. Miss Maroney.
You wanted to see me?

07:44.130 --> 07:46.564
Kenneth, Tracy and I want to
do something for the crew.

07:46.732 --> 07:48.529
You know, to thank them for being sick.

07:48.734 --> 07:51.726
We didn't know what to get them.
But then, I had a brainstorm.

07:51.904 --> 07:54.907
It was a bad one.
Jenna had to put my tongue guard in.

07:54.907 --> 07:58.809
But after he stabilized, we decided
we'd get them all hot soup.

07:59.111 --> 08:00.271
So, go do that.

08:00.513 --> 08:01.547
Oh.

08:01.547 --> 08:03.616
All the other pages have gone home sick.

08:03.616 --> 08:05.584
I can't make any runs right now.

08:05.852 --> 08:08.685
Maybe... the two of you
could go get the soup?

08:10.089 --> 08:11.056
I don't understand.

08:11.557 --> 08:13.926
Well, I'm saying you could get your wallet --

08:13.926 --> 08:14.927
My what?

08:14.927 --> 08:15.995
...and go downstairs
to the basement.

08:15.995 --> 08:16.996
No.

08:16.996 --> 08:19.298
...then, you go to the soup place
and bring the soup back up here.

08:19.298 --> 08:20.299
With what?
My arms?

08:20.299 --> 08:21.334
...make sure to take your ID's with you.

08:21.334 --> 08:22.528
That would be the worst part!

08:23.069 --> 08:25.333
Wait. Tracy, we have to do this.

08:25.538 --> 08:29.133
Without the crew, we'd just be
two amazing people succeeding in a vacuum.

08:29.675 --> 08:31.575
Come on.
Do it for them.

08:31.644 --> 08:33.611
Yeah. For the crew.

08:34.179 --> 08:35.703
Because it's their birthday.

08:39.318 --> 08:40.785
I had a wonderful time last night.

08:40.785 --> 08:41.888
Yeah, I did, too.

08:41.888 --> 08:43.616
Are you with Mr. Templeton now?

08:43.756 --> 08:45.157
How I envy him.

08:45.157 --> 08:46.859
I wish you would exercise my muscles...

08:46.859 --> 08:48.060
...so they don't atrophy.

08:48.060 --> 08:49.857
Well, are you coming over tonight?

08:50.029 --> 08:52.190
We can finish our game of Monopoly.

08:52.565 --> 08:53.566
Of course I am.

08:53.566 --> 08:55.090
I'm just going to be a little late.

08:55.201 --> 08:58.136
I have tickets to a special charity
performance of The Lion King.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.273
I wish I could convince you to go with me.

09:00.273 --> 09:01.941
You know I can't, Jack.

09:01.941 --> 09:03.169
Are you kidding me?

09:03.376 --> 09:05.177
I'd love to go out...

09:05.177 --> 09:08.476
...get all dressed up,
tip maitre d's, and be all like...

09:08.981 --> 09:12.314
"Thank you, Roger.
This table was super-duper."

09:12.685 --> 09:14.084
I live in the Big Apple.

09:14.353 --> 09:16.913
But I spend all my time
with the BigVegetable.

09:17.156 --> 09:21.525
Why can't I have fun
like an upper-middle-class person?

09:22.662 --> 09:23.629
Why can't you?

09:23.963 --> 09:26.232
You sound just like Lemon.
Come with me tonight.

09:26.232 --> 09:27.256
Be a member of the elite.

09:27.867 --> 09:31.064
# The night's like a banquet...
Give it a try...?

09:31.571 --> 09:35.063
# Candlelight, caviar...
You and I...?

09:35.141 --> 09:38.544
# And Templeton...
Mr. Templeton...?

09:38.544 --> 09:42.640
# Why should he stay at home...
Just get his medication...?

09:43.049 --> 09:46.576
# Go with us...
See a show with us...?

09:46.819 --> 09:49.549
# The plan's such a simple one...
Templeton...?

09:49.622 --> 09:51.317
# Don't roll away...?

09:55.895 --> 09:56.862
- Hey, Liz.
- Hey!

09:57.029 --> 10:00.055
I just want to let you know
we appreciate what you said before.

10:00.166 --> 10:02.668
So, in order to thank you,
we got you a meat plate.

10:02.668 --> 10:03.657
Thanks, guys.

10:03.836 --> 10:06.100
I am really
going to eat this.

10:06.606 --> 10:07.974
Enjoy.

10:13.546 --> 10:16.148
Hey, Cerie. What is this text
you sent me supposed to mean?

10:16.148 --> 10:17.172
Your vacation is back on.

10:17.350 --> 10:19.181
Well, how is that
any easier...

10:19.251 --> 10:20.479
Wait. My vacation is back on?

10:20.586 --> 10:23.612
Yeah. I guess since this flu,
there's been a bunch of cancellations.

10:23.689 --> 10:26.089
I am so happy,
the number four, the letter "U".

10:33.299 --> 10:34.664
Thank you, Banyani.

10:38.838 --> 10:39.805
Thank you, Oscar.

10:43.776 --> 10:44.868
Oh, God. They're all sick.

10:47.346 --> 10:48.779
They're all diseased!

10:49.949 --> 10:51.644
I can't get sick. I can't get sick.

10:53.519 --> 10:54.918
Stay away, sick ones!

11:07.867 --> 11:08.868
Miss Lemon!

11:09.935 --> 11:11.903
I have revision pages for you!

11:12.171 --> 11:14.537
Oh, my God, Pete!
Thank God it's you.

11:14.674 --> 11:16.039
Liz. What's wrong?

11:23.349 --> 11:24.316
Why?

11:28.320 --> 11:29.321
Give me the shot.

11:29.321 --> 11:31.789
I want to go on my vacation.
I take back all the stuff I said.

11:31.924 --> 11:33.619
If you want a shot...

11:33.826 --> 11:35.817
...you're going to have to dance for it.

11:44.070 --> 11:45.367
Very nice.

11:49.608 --> 11:50.734
I'm such a hypocrite.

11:50.810 --> 11:54.075
You have to promise me
you won't tell anyone I'm getting this shot.

11:54.213 --> 11:58.240
Liz, I believe doctor-patient
confidentiality is a two-way street.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.850
I'm cheating on my wife.

12:02.054 --> 12:03.021
Ay!

12:10.329 --> 12:13.355
Hey. Where have you guys been?
We were supposed to shoot promos an hour ago!

12:13.632 --> 12:15.657
Okay, we forgot about that.
But we have a good reason.

12:15.801 --> 12:17.632
Yeah, we were out getting soup for the crew.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.635
Nope.
We forgot about that too.

12:20.005 --> 12:22.439
We went out shopping together.
We had fun, though.

12:22.908 --> 12:24.967
# Every girl crazy about a --?

12:25.044 --> 12:26.875
Yeah, I get it. You went shopping.
I don't need the montage.

12:26.979 --> 12:28.848
Yeah. I tried on a lot of outfits.

12:28.848 --> 12:30.483
And some of them,
I was like,"No."

12:30.483 --> 12:32.246
But then, some of them,
I was like, "Yeah!"

12:32.318 --> 12:35.185
So we're running behind because
you guys forgot to get soup.

12:35.588 --> 12:37.715
Is there anything you do that
doesn't make my life harder?

12:39.792 --> 12:41.384
I can't believe we forgot the soup.

12:41.594 --> 12:43.062
We have to think of something else.

12:43.062 --> 12:44.330
I know.

12:44.330 --> 12:47.867
I also want to thank you
for controlling yourself sexually

12:47.867 --> 12:50.062
while we spend time together
on this adventure.

12:52.705 --> 12:54.366
Hey, Liz.

12:54.907 --> 12:56.568
How you feeling?
You got this bug, yet?

12:56.675 --> 12:59.439
Uh, I'm a little achy.
Probably because I didn't get the shot.

12:59.779 --> 13:02.339
Ah... You should go home, sweetheart.
You don't want this.

13:02.548 --> 13:05.039
No way, dude.
If you're working, I'm working.

13:07.353 --> 13:08.320
Later.

13:08.554 --> 13:09.989
That Liz Lemon is okay.

13:09.989 --> 13:11.889
Why did we hate her guts so much?

13:12.625 --> 13:15.561
Lemon. We actually went
on a date last night.

13:15.561 --> 13:16.755
Elisa and I.

13:17.029 --> 13:18.121
And it was magical.

13:20.933 --> 13:22.264
Oh! My purse!

13:24.703 --> 13:26.672
You took the old man with you?

13:26.672 --> 13:28.833
I admit it's
an ethical gray area.

13:28.941 --> 13:30.533
No, it's just wrong.

13:30.609 --> 13:33.345
Yes, well, we can't all
be as noble as you.

13:33.345 --> 13:37.416
Turning down a flu shot on moral grounds,
coming into work and risking your health

13:37.416 --> 13:39.077
despite your special vacation.

13:39.819 --> 13:41.218
It's called principles, Jack.

13:41.587 --> 13:43.885
Oh.
I think I'm probably getting it.

13:44.323 --> 13:45.654
Oh, that reminds me...

13:45.758 --> 13:48.260
About 24 hours
after receiving the flu shot...

13:48.260 --> 13:50.922
...you develop a distinctive rash...

13:50.996 --> 13:52.298
...at the injection site.

13:52.298 --> 13:54.834
So, please let Make-Up know for...

13:54.834 --> 13:56.392
Tracy and Jenna.

14:08.614 --> 14:12.607
I wasn't resting!
A Parcell man never lies down on the job.

14:12.918 --> 14:15.751
Unless that job involves...
milking pig teats.

14:15.988 --> 14:17.785
Miss Lemon, what is that?

14:18.157 --> 14:20.318
Did you... Did you get the shot?

14:20.392 --> 14:22.061
No, no, no.
This is a dream.

14:22.061 --> 14:23.528
You're having a fever dream.

14:23.896 --> 14:25.693
We're speaking French,
and I'm your mother.

14:25.898 --> 14:28.567
Oh... Oh, ma chère maman!
Pourquoi?

14:28.567 --> 14:29.864
Pourquoi m' as tu laissè?

14:33.038 --> 14:35.131
Ta-da!

14:36.909 --> 14:37.933
What are we doing tonight?

14:38.110 --> 14:39.338
It's a surprise.

14:39.745 --> 14:41.007
But he's going to need a helmet.

14:41.747 --> 14:42.714
Come here.

14:48.988 --> 14:50.615
It's Mr. Templeton's son.

14:50.723 --> 14:52.191
I thought you said he
didn't have any family.

14:52.191 --> 14:54.284
Not here. He lives in London.

14:54.960 --> 14:58.464
But now, God has sent him
to punish me for being so bad.

14:58.464 --> 15:00.557
Or maybe it's a business trip.

15:02.268 --> 15:05.371
You need to hide.
I cannot lose this job.

15:05.371 --> 15:08.670
I'd have to go back to working
the late shift at Dunkin' Donuts.

15:09.074 --> 15:10.803
Oh, the customers are so sad.

15:11.543 --> 15:12.544
Can I help you?

15:12.544 --> 15:14.876
Yes. What time do you start
throwing out doughnuts?

15:15.281 --> 15:17.078
He's coming in.

15:19.418 --> 15:20.986
Oh. There you are.

15:20.986 --> 15:23.155
Of course I'm here.
Always.

15:23.155 --> 15:26.025
Sorry to surprise you.
I just wanted to check on Dad.

15:26.025 --> 15:27.014
How's he doing?

15:28.060 --> 15:31.655
Well... he's stable,
but vegetative.

15:31.964 --> 15:33.693
Totally unaware of his surroundings.

15:33.899 --> 15:35.367
A man comes at night.

15:35.367 --> 15:36.732
He comes to the house and takes me.

15:37.036 --> 15:38.003
Dad!

15:38.404 --> 15:39.928
Okay. That's surprising.

15:40.105 --> 15:42.574
He wears a suit.
His hair is thick...

15:42.574 --> 15:44.343
Iike a Bolshevik Commissar.

15:44.343 --> 15:47.608
He made me watch a giraffe
with the legs of a man!

15:47.780 --> 15:49.873
Dad?
It's me, Michael.

15:49.949 --> 15:52.584
He gave money to a silver man!

15:52.584 --> 15:54.381
He ate a plate of fire!

15:54.486 --> 15:56.886
Dad? There's no man.

15:57.089 --> 15:58.724
Yes! He was in prison.

15:58.724 --> 16:00.555
But now, he owns a railroad!

16:03.062 --> 16:05.895
What is going on?
Why is he all worked up?

16:07.733 --> 16:11.403
You know, sometimes, they watch cartoons,
and they think it's real.

16:11.403 --> 16:12.495
It's very common.

16:15.674 --> 16:17.232
Tracy. I've got it!

16:17.543 --> 16:18.777
Give it to me! It's mine!

16:18.777 --> 16:20.768
No. I know what we can get the crew.

16:21.080 --> 16:23.549
They don't need soup.
They need medicine.

16:23.549 --> 16:25.210
And what's the best medicine?

16:25.584 --> 16:26.573
Medicine?

16:26.952 --> 16:29.944
Laughter. Do you see
where I'm going with this?

16:30.556 --> 16:31.523
No!

16:35.694 --> 16:37.218
Well, he's finally asleep.

16:37.563 --> 16:40.157
You must be exhausted.
Why don't you go to bed?

16:40.265 --> 16:41.767
No. Thanks. I'm not tired.

16:41.767 --> 16:42.734
Oh, good.

16:43.135 --> 16:46.105
Because there is something in the
other room that I need to show you.

16:46.105 --> 16:48.437
And I won't remember
what it is until I see it.

16:57.716 --> 16:59.843
The Dark Man is here!
He's come to take me!

17:00.352 --> 17:01.512
Shh! Sir, no!

17:01.720 --> 17:04.156
I did things during the war.
Terrible things.

17:04.156 --> 17:05.748
Mr. Templeton, my name is Jack.

17:06.224 --> 17:10.127
And I'm just a guy dating your nurse,
and I took advantage of your condition

17:10.229 --> 17:12.527
so I could be with her.
Do you understand what I'm saying?

17:12.865 --> 17:17.269
What we did was wrong.
But we did it for the greatest reason of all.

17:17.269 --> 17:21.797
I've lost too many good things because
I couldn't make time for them. And I...

17:22.407 --> 17:24.143
...can't let that happen with Elisa.

17:24.143 --> 17:25.906
Is Elisa the Puerto Rican?

17:26.011 --> 17:29.281
Wow. That really doesn't
sound okay. But, yes.

17:29.281 --> 17:30.305
And I beg you.

17:31.016 --> 17:32.108
Please don't tell your son.

17:32.551 --> 17:33.882
All right.

17:34.019 --> 17:37.511
But the next time we go out,
I want to go to Washington Square Park.

17:37.956 --> 17:40.288
It's where I proposed to my wife.

17:40.392 --> 17:41.359
Oh.

17:41.760 --> 17:42.828
And then...

17:42.828 --> 17:44.762
I want to go to a Negro bar.

17:46.365 --> 17:47.354
I'll see what I can do.

17:54.006 --> 17:56.008
Attention, ladies and germs...

17:56.008 --> 17:56.997
- ...and gentlemen
- Hey, Liz.

17:57.576 --> 17:58.977
Are you ready to feel better?

17:58.977 --> 18:00.877
Because we have just the thing!

18:01.113 --> 18:02.080
- Soup?
- No!

18:02.714 --> 18:06.480
Now, in the grand tradition of Patch Adams...

18:06.552 --> 18:09.154
prepare yourself for the comic stylings

18:09.154 --> 18:11.384
of Tracy the Amazing...

18:11.657 --> 18:14.057
and Jenna!

18:23.368 --> 18:25.768
Really? Do you really think this is helping?

18:28.307 --> 18:30.609
Hey! Leave her alone!

18:30.609 --> 18:31.906
Yeah!

18:32.010 --> 18:35.605
What? Why aren't you laughing?
This is happening to Liz!

18:35.747 --> 18:37.549
No, they love Liz now.

18:37.549 --> 18:40.018
Everybody likes me.
It's you two idiots --

18:40.018 --> 18:41.349
Hey! What's that on your arm?

18:41.753 --> 18:44.517
She got a flu shot!
She... She lied to us!

18:44.756 --> 18:46.158
Give us back our meat plate!

18:46.158 --> 18:47.159
Yeah!

18:47.159 --> 18:48.560
No, guys. Listen,
you don't understand.

18:48.560 --> 18:49.561
This vacation --

18:49.561 --> 18:50.896
You sold us out for a vacation?

18:50.896 --> 18:52.420
No! Not just any vacation.

18:52.631 --> 18:55.334
This one has beach socks and ice cream

18:55.334 --> 18:56.358
and sandwich turtles!

18:57.436 --> 19:00.166
I work so hard, guys.
Don't I deserve to sit on a beach?

19:00.272 --> 19:01.364
Je vous déteste!

19:02.207 --> 19:03.174
Yeah!

19:03.509 --> 19:04.771
It's not what you think!

19:06.211 --> 19:07.974
There is a gentleman involved!

19:09.414 --> 19:11.974
A Filipino gentleman.
His name is Banyani.

19:12.117 --> 19:14.551
I want to take him as my island lover!

19:16.522 --> 19:18.190
Last year, he was totally sending signals.

19:18.190 --> 19:19.714
And this time, I was going to go for it!

19:20.225 --> 19:22.557
There! I said it! Are you happy?

19:23.529 --> 19:25.364
It kind of peters out after that.

19:25.364 --> 19:28.925
I just suck pie off my
sweatshirt for the next half hour.

19:30.202 --> 19:32.237
Ugh. I'm so embarrassed.

19:32.237 --> 19:33.329
Well, that goes with out saying.

19:33.405 --> 19:35.669
But the good news is
that your relationship with the crew...

19:35.841 --> 19:38.544
is back where it should be.
And now, you can go on your vacation...

19:38.544 --> 19:39.511
guilt-free.

19:39.645 --> 19:41.545
No, I can't.
I feel like a jerk.

19:41.613 --> 19:43.849
Oh, come on, Lemon.
Embrace your elitism.

19:43.849 --> 19:45.714
What do we elites do
when we screw up?

19:46.151 --> 19:48.554
We pretend it never happened
and give ourselves a giant bonus.

19:48.554 --> 19:51.256
That you don't deserve.
I don't deserve to go anywhere.

19:51.256 --> 19:52.587
Says who?

19:52.691 --> 19:56.161
What Elisa and I did wasn't right,
but we're happier now.

19:56.161 --> 19:58.721
And you're going to be happier
when you go to St. Bartleby's and get...

19:59.031 --> 20:00.589
whatever's left of your groove back.

20:00.899 --> 20:03.367
Face it, Lemon.
Not everyone gets a shot.

20:03.502 --> 20:06.096
Not everyone gets to go to the Caribbean.
But you're special.

20:06.505 --> 20:07.706
You're better.

20:07.706 --> 20:09.105
So, go.

20:09.274 --> 20:10.400
Go to your...

20:11.009 --> 20:11.998
island lover.

20:12.411 --> 20:14.709
Yeah. Alright. Yes. I'm gonna.

20:18.283 --> 20:19.545
Did that come out of you or me?

20:19.618 --> 20:21.085
I don't know.

20:21.286 --> 20:22.617
It's really hot in here.

20:22.821 --> 20:26.518
You know, the flu vaccine is actually
a small dose of the virus itself.

20:26.825 --> 20:28.759
So, there's always the risk that
-- Oh God!

20:29.261 --> 20:31.263
Both ends! Both ends!

20:31.263 --> 20:32.525
I'm not going to make it!

20:33.565 --> 20:37.336
# The city is hopping
With things to do?

20:37.336 --> 20:40.839
# But it's 1/3 funner
With you-know-who?

20:40.839 --> 20:44.775
# Yes, Templeton...
Mr. Templeton...?

20:44.977 --> 20:48.747
# Let's go have some thrills...
Pack his pills and his glasses...?

20:48.747 --> 20:52.217
# We'll get a bite...
Then we'll say goodnight...?

20:52.217 --> 20:56.288
# To our own special friend...
Mr. Templeton...?

20:56.288 --> 21:00.156
# Please...
Look away...?

21:00.892 --> 21:04.225
# We'll be out till dawn...?

21:04.429 --> 21:07.557
# Strap your helmet on...?
