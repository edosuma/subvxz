So listen, Michael,
your branch has been
doing great lately,

10:18.201 --> 10:21.287
and your sales staff
is reporting
very strong numbers.

10:21.997 --> 10:24.206

in fact.

10:25.208 --> 10:28.377
And l don't know
exactly how to put this,

10:29.379 --> 10:35.092
but what are you
doing right?

Right what?

are struggling,

is reporting
strong numbers.

10:44.352 --> 10:46.270
Look, you're not
our most traditional guy,

10:46.354 --> 10:50.190
but clearly something
you are doing is right,

10:50.275 --> 10:53.402
and l just. . .
l need to get a sense
of what that is.

10:55.155 --> 10:59.158
David, here it is.
My philosophy
is basically this.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.202
And this is something
that l live by,

11:02.287 --> 11:04.413
and l always have,
and l always will.

for any reason,
do anything to anyone

11:11.838 --> 11:17.634
for any reason ever,
no matter what,
no matter where,

11:18.928 --> 11:23.974
or who,
or who you are with,
or where you are going,

11:24.351 --> 11:27.311
or where you've been

11:29.939 --> 11:31.231
ever,

11:32.192 --> 11:34.026
for any reason
whatsoever. . .

11:34.110 --> 11:36.904
Sometimes l'll start
a sentence and l don't
even know where it's going.

11:36.988 --> 11:39.531
l just hope
l find it
along the way.

11:39.616 --> 11:41.116
Like an improv
conversation.

11:42.285 --> 11:43.660
An improversation.

11:44.329 --> 11:45.829
This is gonna sound
sort of high maintenance,

11:45.914 --> 11:48.290
but could we have it,
like, three degrees
cooler in here?

11:48.375 --> 11:50.876
l always think better
when it's cooler.

11:50.960 --> 11:53.670
Here's the thing,
Michael is doing
something right,

11:53.755 --> 11:55.589
and in this
economic climate,

11:55.673 --> 11:58.050
no method of success
can be ignored.

11:58.134 --> 12:01.553
lt's not really a time
for executives to start
getting judgmental now.

12:01.679 --> 12:03.055
lt's Hail Mary time.

12:03.139 --> 12:06.100
Hey, what say
we order up some pasta?

12:07.936 --> 12:09.228
What say we do.

12:10.772 --> 12:12.981
Standard, you know.
Nothing fancy.

12:13.066 --> 12:14.358
So, like, missionary?

12:14.442 --> 12:16.235
l said nothing fancy.

12:16.319 --> 12:17.611
Do you love him?

12:18.071 --> 12:19.405
l love you.

12:19.489 --> 12:21.073
Why should l believe that?

12:21.157 --> 12:24.701
Andy, we are at
a crossroads here,

12:25.286 --> 12:28.163
and we can either give in
to what people are saying,

12:28.248 --> 12:29.623
that we're not
good together. . .

12:29.707 --> 12:30.749
Who says that?

12:30.834 --> 12:33.127
. . .or we can
prove them wrong.

12:34.170 --> 12:36.088
Let's prove
them wrong.

12:44.180 --> 12:45.514
Where's Dwight?

12:45.598 --> 12:46.932
You okay, man?

12:47.016 --> 12:51.603
No, not at all, actually.
But thanks for asking.
Appreciate it.

12:51.688 --> 12:53.647
You know what?
l'd also like to
take this opportunity

12:53.731 --> 12:57.025
to thank all of you
for lying to my face

12:57.652 --> 12:59.778
and not telling me
what's been going on
this entire time.

12:59.863 --> 13:01.447
You are welcome.

13:07.203 --> 13:08.203
Dwight.

13:09.998 --> 13:11.039
Andy.

13:12.625 --> 13:14.126
lt's over.

13:14.210 --> 13:15.794
Good.
She broke up with you.

13:15.879 --> 13:18.881
No, it's over
between you two.

13:19.424 --> 13:22.342
No way.
l am not giving up.

13:22.469 --> 13:24.761
You have to.
No, l don't.

13:25.180 --> 13:28.474
She doesn't love you.
She's marrying me.

13:28.558 --> 13:29.808
Well, l don't know
about that

13:29.893 --> 13:34.438
because she certainly
seems to enjoy making
lovemaking with me.

13:34.522 --> 13:36.148
Angela Bernard. . .

13:36.232 --> 13:38.233
Will never be her name.

13:38.568 --> 13:41.695
Will be her name
and you will have
to call her that.

13:41.779 --> 13:43.071
l don't think so.

13:43.156 --> 13:46.241
Hey, guys.
Why don't we just
cool off a bit?

13:46.326 --> 13:47.451
l'm telling you
to back down.

13:47.535 --> 13:49.077
And l'm telling you
that l will never
back down.

13:49.162 --> 13:50.162
Then l'll make you.

13:50.246 --> 13:51.747
Oh, really? How are
you going to do that?

13:51.831 --> 13:53.165
Through the use of force.

13:53.249 --> 13:54.500
That is very general

13:54.584 --> 13:56.001
and does not scare me
in the slightest.

13:56.085 --> 13:57.503
l will fight you.

13:57.587 --> 14:00.839
Nope.
Okay, fine. Good ! A duel.

14:00.924 --> 14:03.050
The winner gets Angela.
Fine!

14:03.134 --> 14:04.593
Fine!
This is nuts.

14:04.677 --> 14:06.094
What is your weapon?
Okay, you know what?

14:06.179 --> 14:07.221
That's enough
because. . .

14:07.305 --> 14:08.347
Hey, this is none
of your business.

14:08.431 --> 14:10.807
Hey, it is my business
what happens at work.

14:10.934 --> 14:13.268
Guess what?
Not happening at work.
Yes.

14:13.394 --> 14:15.145
We're gonna
do it outside.
Outside of work.

14:15.230 --> 14:18.524
None of your business.
None of your business, then.

14:18.608 --> 14:20.067
Good, so what weapon?

14:20.151 --> 14:21.193
My bare hands.

14:21.277 --> 14:24.196
That is stupid. l will use
a sword, and l will cut off
your bare hands.

14:24.280 --> 14:25.656
Then l'll get
something, too.

14:25.740 --> 14:28.367
l've had two men
fight over me before.

14:28.451 --> 14:30.994
Usually it's over
which one gets to
hold the camcorder.

14:31.079 --> 14:34.248
Angela, you have
to put a stop to
this right now.

14:38.002 --> 14:40.629
l will respect
the results
of the duel.

14:41.089 --> 14:43.423
Of course you will.
l call loser.

14:43.758 --> 14:48.470
l will be taking
my break at 4:00
in the parking lot.

14:49.347 --> 14:51.181
l will also be
taking my break

14:51.266 --> 14:54.142
at the exact same time
and in the same location.

14:55.562 --> 14:57.312
What a coincidence.
Hmm.

15:05.822 --> 15:09.449
So, l either
get more involved
or l take a sick day.

15:09.534 --> 15:10.951
(CHUCKLES)

15:11.619 --> 15:14.580
Leaving Dwight in charge.
Oh, God.

15:25.341 --> 15:27.175
How'd that get there?

15:31.681 --> 15:34.182
There's a star-shaped
thing taped under
the kitchen table.

15:34.267 --> 15:35.892
Thanks, Meredith.

15:36.769 --> 15:38.687
So l was in the office,

15:39.397 --> 15:44.526
and l look over to
our accounting division,
and there's Kevin Malone.

15:44.819 --> 15:48.447
Kevin is wearing
a jacket that l've
never seen before,

15:48.531 --> 15:51.116
and l call over
to Kevin,

15:51.200 --> 15:55.370
"Kevin, is that
a tweed jacket?"

15:56.039 --> 15:57.289
And he looks at me
and he says,

15:57.373 --> 15:59.625
"Michael, yes,
it is a tweed jacket."

15:59.709 --> 16:01.668
And l look back
at him and l say,

16:01.753 --> 16:06.256
"l feel the need,
the need for tweed."

16:08.551 --> 16:10.385
lt's hard to try
and evaluate yourself,
Michael,

16:10.470 --> 16:12.679
but l appreciate
you trying.

16:13.723 --> 16:15.432
And thanks for coming in.
Oh !

16:15.975 --> 16:17.309
Thank you.
Yes.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.144
l have to say,
l am so impressed

16:19.228 --> 16:21.688
with the potential
you see in me.

16:22.899 --> 16:24.733
Yeah.
Okay.

16:30.948 --> 16:32.574
Yeah, finish up.

16:41.793 --> 16:43.585
Come on !
Come on out!

16:44.837 --> 16:47.089
l can't believe
they're gonna
fight over me.

16:47.173 --> 16:50.425
l guess people
have fewer choices
as they get older.

16:50.635 --> 16:51.885
DWlGHT: Come on !

16:51.969 --> 16:53.845

he's gonna show.

16:56.516 --> 16:59.518
Oh, come on, man.
Believe in something.

16:59.602 --> 17:06.108
Come on, coward !
Where are you?
Where. . .

17:12.782 --> 17:14.366
"From the desk
of Andrew Bernard."

17:14.450 --> 17:15.784

you have received my note.

He's in his car.

17:38.474 --> 17:39.766

what is he doing?

17:39.851 --> 17:41.476
Why isn't Dwight
turning around?

17:41.561 --> 17:45.021
The Prius is silent
if he keeps it under
five miles per hour.
