00:13.228 --> 00:15.115
My God, it is cold!

00:15.371 --> 00:17.127
It must be 20 below
with the wind chill.

00:17.387 --> 00:19.526
This is no place for a Mexican.

00:19.979 --> 00:21.441
I thought you hated
night shift.

00:21.675 --> 00:23.585
I'm filling in for Haleh.

00:23.884 --> 00:25.793
We'll see plenty of
frostbite tonight.

00:26.060 --> 00:29.126
And bum-sicles.
I hate the smell when they thaw.

00:38.763 --> 00:40.324
Place looks dead.

00:41.835 --> 00:43.974
Well, this guy certainly is.

00:45.995 --> 00:47.818
Randi, you know we got
a DB in the hall?

00:48.107 --> 00:50.758
The morgue's slow. I put him
near the door to keep cool.

00:51.020 --> 00:52.449
- Good thinking.
- Is this right?

00:52.684 --> 00:54.145
Not a single patient.

00:54.412 --> 00:55.590
It's too cold to be sick.

00:55.851 --> 00:58.983
I guess I'm gonna have time to
work on my curriculum vitae.

00:59.244 --> 01:00.072
What's that?

01:00.331 --> 01:03.680
It's a fancy word for r Ásum Á.
I've got tenure review this week.

01:03.979 --> 01:05.889
- You wanna join the faculty?
- It'd be nice.

01:06.155 --> 01:09.865
Dr. Greene? Legal sent you
this letter and charts to be signed.

01:11.180 --> 01:13.002
They're writing me up for not
co-signing charts.

01:13.260 --> 01:14.820
Won't that hurt your chance?

01:15.083 --> 01:16.327
Won't help.

01:16.940 --> 01:18.827
Competition pretty stiff?

01:19.052 --> 01:21.637
About 5'4", red hair, with a limp.

01:28.460 --> 01:29.474
Lydia?

01:29.739 --> 01:31.561
How'd you like to make
an easy 50 bucks?

01:32.044 --> 01:32.774
How?

01:33.035 --> 01:35.752
I'm studying how exercise affects
the circadian rhythms...

01:36.011 --> 01:37.418
...of night shift workers.

01:37.708 --> 01:39.650
Is that why E-Ray's
doing jumping jacks?

01:39.884 --> 01:43.429
- Yes. But we need one more subject.
- My publishing deadline's in two days.

01:43.691 --> 01:45.284
So I'm kind of in a bind.

01:45.580 --> 01:46.986
Sorry. Not interested.

01:48.395 --> 01:50.850
All right. We'll keep looking.

01:51.115 --> 01:52.195
Wendy.

02:02.603 --> 02:06.116
<i>Very good!</i>
<i>How much are a dozen bananas?</i>

02:12.620 --> 02:14.725
- Very good!
- Thank you.

02:17.420 --> 02:19.973
I left the packing till now.
I'll be here all night.

02:20.267 --> 02:22.340
- That presents opportunities.
- I have to pack.

02:22.572 --> 02:25.255
- Please!
- Come back at 3:00.

02:30.571 --> 02:33.124
Have you seen Carter?
Someone said he's in here.

02:33.388 --> 02:34.817
Doesn't look like it.

02:35.115 --> 02:38.431
- Sorry. Have a safe trip.
- Thank you. Bye-bye.

02:42.443 --> 02:43.458
Carol?

02:43.755 --> 02:44.518
Mary, what's up?

02:44.779 --> 02:45.859
Budget just came out.

02:46.091 --> 02:48.328
We've got a crisis conference
tomorrow morning.

02:48.619 --> 02:51.816
- Crisis conference?
- ER nursing's $94,000 over.

02:52.043 --> 02:52.872
Can't we add to it?

02:53.131 --> 02:55.335
You're gonna have
to let two nurses go.

02:55.627 --> 02:57.220
But I'm understaffed as it is.

02:57.484 --> 02:59.272
Name me a department that isn't.

02:59.499 --> 03:01.158
The county's out of money.

03:01.419 --> 03:03.307
You've got three junior RNs:
Maylik...

03:03.563 --> 03:06.181
- Malik.
- Malik McGrath, Chuny Marquez and Conni...

03:06.443 --> 03:07.817
Oligario.

03:08.075 --> 03:09.504
You can keep one.

03:09.772 --> 03:10.852
Which two get the ax?

03:11.755 --> 03:12.737
That's your decision.

03:13.004 --> 03:15.208
I don't know.
I've never done this before.

03:15.499 --> 03:18.947
I gotta have an answer by tomorrow.
Are you on tonight?

03:21.195 --> 03:22.122
Leave it on my e-mail.

03:22.379 --> 03:24.681
Make sure I get it by
8 in the morning.

04:17.195 --> 04:19.617
If you could choose how to die,
how would you do it?

04:19.915 --> 04:21.159
That's morbid.

04:21.387 --> 04:23.656
If I could choose how to die,
I'd go by OD.

04:23.915 --> 04:26.850
- A stroke is better.
- Lf you survive, you're an end table.

04:27.115 --> 04:29.636
- Still no patients?
- Nope, but we got takeout.

04:29.900 --> 04:31.329
We ordered you your usual.

04:31.627 --> 04:32.641
What do I owe you, Chuny?

04:32.875 --> 04:34.468
- Put it away.
- Come on. Conni?

04:34.731 --> 04:36.225
- We got you covered.
- Thanks.

04:36.491 --> 04:38.662
- My hands cold?
- Oh, God! Sadist!

04:38.923 --> 04:41.476
I'm sorry about that
surprise Christmas morning.

04:41.739 --> 04:42.600
Santa didn't come?

04:42.859 --> 04:45.445
I opened my door to
a homeless street urchin.

04:45.707 --> 04:48.096
- You opened my door.
- Right. I opened her door.

04:48.396 --> 04:50.632
- She stole Mom's silverware.
- I'll pay for it.

04:50.859 --> 04:53.478
- She won't take your money.
- I won't offer again.

04:53.739 --> 04:57.035
My New Year's resolution is to
resist charitable impulses.

04:57.323 --> 05:00.073
Risk Management said we're
overdue for a safety check.

05:00.331 --> 05:01.062
Why tell me?

05:01.323 --> 05:04.226
You're the safety officer.
They want it done tonight.

05:04.460 --> 05:07.078
- I got 50 charts to do...
- Carol and I will take it.

05:07.340 --> 05:09.282
What happened to resisting
charitable impulses?

05:09.547 --> 05:12.581
Speaking of, anyone wanna
sign up for a night shift study?

05:15.371 --> 05:16.997
Boy, it is dead!

05:17.259 --> 05:19.234
Finished my charts.
It's not even 9:00.

05:19.499 --> 05:21.604
- Want some action?
- What do you got in mind?

05:21.867 --> 05:25.413
Edson's sick, you can take
his place on the code team.

05:25.675 --> 05:26.471
Absolutely.

05:26.763 --> 05:27.810
Hey, John.

05:28.075 --> 05:29.187
He boned me, man!

05:30.827 --> 05:31.755
Benton wouldn't let you off?

05:32.107 --> 05:34.474
Two days is all I asked for.
Son of a bitch!

05:35.115 --> 05:36.839
You know, Dennis...

05:37.099 --> 05:40.416
...if Monique's with this other guy,
there's nothing you can do...

05:40.683 --> 05:42.342
...even if you did fly down there.

05:42.603 --> 05:44.970
I'd sure as hell like
the chance to try.

05:48.683 --> 05:51.334
You wanna go to that place
and get some fries with gravy?

05:51.595 --> 05:53.962
I wish I could.
I got all these charts to do.

05:54.571 --> 05:56.098
Okay. I hear you.

05:56.907 --> 05:59.296
If Benton asks, I'll be
back in an hour.

06:03.627 --> 06:05.515
I thought you finished the charts.

06:05.739 --> 06:08.936
I've listened to him moan about
that girlfriend for two weeks.

06:09.227 --> 06:10.405
Tonight is slow enough.

06:11.275 --> 06:12.584
Who's our first lucky customer?

06:12.843 --> 06:15.363
Lady fell asleep at McGoo's.
Waitress brought her in.

06:15.595 --> 06:18.378
She's kind of loopy. No I.D.
Says her name's Shelly.

06:19.435 --> 06:21.890
No needles!
I just wanna sleep.

06:22.155 --> 06:24.773
Temp's 103, and look at this.

06:25.643 --> 06:26.374
Photophobia.

06:26.924 --> 06:29.029
I'm Dr. Greene.
I need to examine you.

06:29.323 --> 06:30.184
Leave me alone!

06:31.243 --> 06:34.178
You have symptoms of meningitis,
which is really serious.

06:34.571 --> 06:37.320
We need to do a spinal tap
just to be sure.

06:38.731 --> 06:40.706
Let me give you
a shot of antibiotics.

06:40.972 --> 06:42.182
No needles, I said!

06:45.739 --> 06:48.903
If you do have meningitis and we
don't treat you, you could die.

06:49.163 --> 06:50.985
Die, cry, let me fry.

06:57.131 --> 06:58.342
Do you know where you are?

06:58.603 --> 07:02.433
In the hospital, talking to Dr. Greene
with a head like a bean.

07:04.139 --> 07:05.416
Do you know what day it is?

07:05.707 --> 07:09.056
Thursday, January 16th.
Bing! Correct!

07:09.291 --> 07:13.382
Alex Trebek, next:
Stupid Questions for $ 200.

07:14.923 --> 07:18.786
I'm 90o/o sure it's meningitis, which
is probably causing her mental status.

07:19.051 --> 07:20.229
She won't let me take blood.

07:20.491 --> 07:21.952
She can't make her own decisions.

07:22.219 --> 07:24.586
- I need a consent override.
- Run it by Risk Management.

07:24.843 --> 07:26.119
- No, I don't.
- Yeah, you do.

07:26.379 --> 07:28.201
All consent overrides
go through Legal.

07:28.747 --> 07:31.081
Fine. Tell them
I'm doing a spinal tap...

07:31.307 --> 07:33.958
...on a demented woman
without her consent.

07:36.395 --> 07:40.105
Well, we've got some loose tile here.
And some crumbling grout.

07:40.395 --> 07:42.020
Faulty tile and grout.

07:42.283 --> 07:44.072
This could be trouble
in an open wound.

07:44.331 --> 07:45.738
Trouble indeed! Good catch.

07:45.995 --> 07:47.751
Did you note
the wobbly IV stands?

07:47.979 --> 07:49.801
Roger that.
You got a flair for this.

07:50.091 --> 07:51.618
Thank you.

07:52.235 --> 07:53.413
You know...

07:54.123 --> 07:56.360
...this clock could fall
right off the wall.

07:56.619 --> 07:58.626
I don't know how you do it.

07:59.403 --> 08:02.436
It's established that night work
disrupts circadian rhythms.

08:02.699 --> 08:03.462
I've heard that.

08:03.723 --> 08:05.895
I hope to prove
moderate physical exertion...

08:06.187 --> 08:08.707
...can switch circadian rhythms
back into phase.

08:09.547 --> 08:11.205
When you say
"moderate physical exertion"...

08:11.467 --> 08:14.980
A few minute's exercise.
Jog around the block. Not strenuous.

08:15.243 --> 08:16.323
It's all set up.

08:16.619 --> 08:18.594
I don't know, I'm not in good shape.

08:18.827 --> 08:20.616
You look plenty healthy to me.

08:27.691 --> 08:28.705
Oh, my God!

08:29.003 --> 08:30.693
- Are you okay?
- What were you doing?

08:30.955 --> 08:32.417
Safety check. You okay?

08:32.650 --> 08:34.374
- I'm bleeding.
- I can stitch it up.

08:34.635 --> 08:36.642
I would prefer Jeanie.

08:39.371 --> 08:41.672
And you were doing so well.

08:50.091 --> 08:52.131
Maggie, you got anything good?

08:52.363 --> 08:54.502
Carol Hathaway dropped
a clock on Weaver's head.

08:54.731 --> 08:57.284
- Deliberately?
- I'm foggy on the details.

08:57.579 --> 08:59.303
We got paramedics pulling up.

08:59.563 --> 09:00.425
Now we're talking!

09:00.715 --> 09:03.879
- Nobody called for a surgical consult.
- I'm saving you the trouble.

09:04.139 --> 09:06.179
Found him on the floor
in acute distress.

09:06.475 --> 09:08.482
Chest and belly pain.
Vitals, normal.

09:08.715 --> 09:09.794
Wouldn't let us start an IV.

09:10.059 --> 09:10.920
Does this hurt?

09:11.563 --> 09:12.424
Looks like a surgical abdomen.

09:12.683 --> 09:14.920
- I haven't made that assessment.
- You don't have to.

09:15.211 --> 09:17.098
Should I call for an Attending?

09:18.315 --> 09:20.551
Up and over!

09:21.675 --> 09:23.431
Let's get an IV started.

09:24.779 --> 09:25.827
I think I hear a rub.

09:26.091 --> 09:27.368
I may have a pulsatile mass.

09:27.627 --> 09:28.837
Give me a 12-lead and a chest film.

09:29.099 --> 09:29.960
Get me a cross-table abdomen.

09:30.219 --> 09:31.080
- Which first?
- Chest.

09:31.371 --> 09:33.542
Abdomen.
He could have an aneurysm.

09:33.803 --> 09:35.942
- I don't want to miss an acute MI.
- I don't want to miss a triple-A.

09:36.235 --> 09:37.380
If it's an MI, he needs TPA.

09:37.611 --> 09:39.204
If it's an aneurysm,
he goes to O.R.

09:39.467 --> 09:40.677
Time is heart muscle.

09:40.971 --> 09:42.596
Ever have an aneurysm
blow up in your face?

09:42.859 --> 09:44.266
Hey, guys.

09:45.259 --> 09:46.404
I'm feeling much better.

09:46.699 --> 09:48.161
- You need to lie down.
- You need x-rays.

09:48.395 --> 09:49.322
No. I'm fine...

09:49.611 --> 09:52.393
...except for a stuffy nose.
Could I have a flu shot?

09:52.651 --> 09:53.796
I remember this dude.

09:54.059 --> 09:57.158
To get a ride to the hospital,
he calls 911 and plays possum.

09:57.387 --> 10:00.616
But I'm on Social Security.
I can't afford a cab.

10:00.875 --> 10:02.882
And it's too cold for the bus.

10:03.147 --> 10:04.074
You want a flu shot?

10:04.331 --> 10:05.957
If it wouldn't be too much trouble?

10:06.219 --> 10:07.233
It's all yours.

10:07.499 --> 10:09.222
Gee, thanks!

10:09.483 --> 10:12.778
I'm just saying, there's no point
in me going back to general surgery.

10:13.034 --> 10:13.983
You learned all there is?

10:14.251 --> 10:15.974
I want another Pediatric rotation.

10:16.235 --> 10:17.795
- Why?
- I want to be a pediatric surgeon.

10:23.659 --> 10:25.601
She said that my technique
was excellent.

10:27.723 --> 10:31.106
You're in luck. He's doing
a jejunal atresia tonight.

10:31.403 --> 10:34.305
If he'll take you,
you're back in Pediatric.

10:34.795 --> 10:36.705
Could I cover Pedes Sick-U?

10:41.547 --> 10:42.724
Anything else?

10:43.787 --> 10:45.314
No, thank you.

10:49.131 --> 10:51.880
- Chuny, you got that LP tray?
- By the door.

10:52.491 --> 10:54.379
Can you give us a hand?
We may need you.

10:54.635 --> 10:55.366
There's someone...

10:55.626 --> 10:57.634
Why won't you tell me your address?

10:57.931 --> 10:59.338
Excuse me. Who are you?

10:59.563 --> 11:00.676
Dr. Greene?

11:00.939 --> 11:04.419
Pat Guinet, Hospital Counsel. You
want to do a spinal tap on this patient?

11:04.683 --> 11:06.657
- That's right.
- She's not keen on the idea.

11:06.923 --> 11:08.930
I've assessed her
as mentally incompetent.

11:09.227 --> 11:11.114
We just had a fairly
coherent conversation.

11:11.339 --> 11:12.648
Is that a medical diagnosis?

11:13.547 --> 11:16.394
Look, doctor, she's clearly
a borderline case.

11:16.650 --> 11:18.658
We have been sued
by these patients in the past.

11:18.955 --> 11:21.475
I'm saving her life,
and you're talking legal exposure.

11:22.091 --> 11:23.040
That's why I'm paid.

11:23.307 --> 11:24.834
I'm paid to help sick people.

11:25.099 --> 11:27.106
I'm not gonna wrestle
with you, doctor.

11:27.403 --> 11:28.930
I'm writing on the chart:

11:29.707 --> 11:33.504
"You're advised against treating
this woman without her consent."

11:33.739 --> 11:34.502
And you and anyone...

11:34.763 --> 11:38.341
...who assists you, will be
putting your jobs in jeopardy.

11:39.883 --> 11:41.345
Get a psych consult.

11:41.579 --> 11:45.223
If they agree she's incompetent,
put her on a hold and proceed.

11:45.931 --> 11:47.753
Until then, don't touch her.

11:56.683 --> 11:58.243
Just one more stitch.

11:58.538 --> 12:01.605
Have you given any more thought
to participating in my study?

12:01.835 --> 12:03.361
I've got paperwork I need to do.

12:03.595 --> 12:06.562
It won't take much time.
Just 15 minutes every couple hours.

12:06.859 --> 12:09.729
- Lf we get busy, it'll be a problem.
- It's been slow so far.

12:12.107 --> 12:14.016
My being HIV-positive
won't skew the results?

12:14.283 --> 12:15.876
Won't make a bit of difference.

12:16.266 --> 12:18.852
Tonight's my last night to
collect data. And if l...

12:19.146 --> 12:21.830
My findings will be incom...
well, worthless, really.

12:22.091 --> 12:24.840
But see, if you're too busy,
I respect your decision.

12:25.674 --> 12:29.351
Just as I've always respected
and supported your decisions.

12:31.947 --> 12:33.889
What would I have to do?

12:34.154 --> 12:35.845
He scores!

12:40.395 --> 12:43.046
- We finally get a bonafide patient?
- But we can't touch her.

12:43.306 --> 12:45.510
She asked for another blanket
and a snack.

12:45.771 --> 12:48.138
So we're not a hospital,
we're a bed-and-breakfast?

12:48.395 --> 12:49.126
Psych come down?

12:49.387 --> 12:52.038
- No, not yet.
- Try again. I'll be in the lounge.

12:52.298 --> 12:55.594
- Call Missing Persons?
- Yeah, but no one's missed her.

12:56.011 --> 12:58.499
We got a wheelchair with no brakes...

12:58.762 --> 13:01.097
...and three IV stands
I think are wobbly.

13:01.355 --> 13:02.762
What do we do with them?

13:03.306 --> 13:04.037
Ugly!

13:04.299 --> 13:06.208
If it isn't my favorite thief.

13:06.442 --> 13:07.686
You got your wallet back.

13:07.914 --> 13:09.191
My mother's silverware?

13:09.482 --> 13:10.628
I didn't take it. I swear.

13:10.859 --> 13:13.248
Do I call Security,
or will you leave by yourself?

13:13.547 --> 13:16.394
No, listen, man.
I need some bread.

13:16.683 --> 13:17.544
No, serious.

13:17.962 --> 13:20.231
There's this dude trying to pimp me.
And I don't wanna...

13:20.523 --> 13:23.273
He says I gotta pay him
100 bucks, or he'll kill me.

13:23.530 --> 13:25.123
Maybe we should tell the cops.

13:25.386 --> 13:26.597
I don't deal with cops.

13:26.827 --> 13:30.656
And I don't deal with liars who take
advantage of people who help them.

13:31.019 --> 13:32.393
You're a creep. You know that?

13:32.747 --> 13:34.089
A creep and a pervert!

13:34.859 --> 13:37.030
That's right! This doctor
made me go down on him!

13:37.322 --> 13:38.751
He gave me VD.
He got me pregnant!

13:38.986 --> 13:41.442
And now he wants me
to pay for the abortion!

13:41.706 --> 13:43.015
Child molester!

13:44.779 --> 13:46.339
Lovely girl.

13:50.154 --> 13:52.543
I wanted to ask you about
a Pediatric surgical rotation.

13:55.179 --> 13:56.608
This isn't a good time.

13:56.843 --> 13:59.560
I'll be in Pedes Sick-U all night.

14:05.354 --> 14:08.071
- You were looking for me?
- You're on Sick-U with me.

14:08.331 --> 14:09.313
Isn't Zeidenberg on?

14:09.610 --> 14:12.993
Order everyone's labs
and advance the drain on Bed 3.

14:17.386 --> 14:18.401
Here's one for you.

14:18.667 --> 14:20.096
"Longing for your embrace.

14:20.362 --> 14:24.072
Financial officer seeks life
of adventure with very special lady."

14:24.362 --> 14:26.370
- Forget it.
- Sounds like money, honey.

14:26.634 --> 14:28.457
What are we gonna talk about?
Dow averages?

14:29.995 --> 14:32.166
"Sensual M.D., 35.

14:32.459 --> 14:33.604
- 6' 1 ".
- I like tall.

14:33.866 --> 14:36.866
Makes up in passion what
he lacks in hair."

14:39.339 --> 14:40.287
Not me.

14:41.738 --> 14:43.462
I'm not so desperate to use personals.

14:43.691 --> 14:44.738
You calling me desperate?

14:45.515 --> 14:46.977
No. That's not what I meant.

14:47.242 --> 14:48.803
So where do you find all your dates?

14:49.066 --> 14:51.303
- I haven't had one in a while.
- See?

14:51.563 --> 14:53.188
Don't knock it till you try it.

14:54.026 --> 14:55.969
Dr. Greene,
psych's here on that lady.

14:56.715 --> 14:57.663
Who is it? McDonald?

14:57.931 --> 14:59.011
No, some intern.

15:06.923 --> 15:08.613
I didn't realize we were
coming down this hallway.

15:08.907 --> 15:10.794
Neither did I.

15:11.050 --> 15:12.992
Which room was it, anyway?

15:13.707 --> 15:14.754
I don't know.

15:15.082 --> 15:17.952
It was either this door or this one.

15:18.218 --> 15:20.455
No, Doug. It's this one.

15:20.715 --> 15:22.984
Right. Lots of stolen
moments in there, huh?

15:23.274 --> 15:24.867
Yes, there were.

15:25.483 --> 15:26.825
So should we?

15:27.722 --> 15:29.097
- What?
- Open the door.

15:29.355 --> 15:30.599
Oh, yeah, sure.
Why not?

15:30.858 --> 15:33.411
Come on. You got it?

15:36.202 --> 15:38.919
- Did it always smell like this?
- I think it did.

15:39.179 --> 15:40.870
Now, if I remember...

15:41.131 --> 15:44.447
...I bet we still got some candles.

15:45.387 --> 15:47.721
- What?
- Yep! Look at this.

15:48.234 --> 15:49.445
Got a match?

15:49.739 --> 15:51.462
Oh, my God!

15:52.266 --> 15:55.048
Shelly, I'm gonna ask you to commit
three things to memory:

15:55.339 --> 15:58.951
A fire engine, a mobile home
and a pen.

15:59.211 --> 15:59.941
Why?

16:00.202 --> 16:01.380
Just try to remember them.

16:01.674 --> 16:03.103
Can you tell me the date?

16:03.338 --> 16:04.266
Get away!

16:04.554 --> 16:05.896
Temp's up to 103.5.

16:06.122 --> 16:08.227
Look, we're running out of time.

16:08.523 --> 16:10.083
Shelly? The date?

16:10.347 --> 16:12.616
I already told Dr. Greene-bean.

16:13.483 --> 16:14.890
Was she oriented to time?

16:15.147 --> 16:16.608
More or less.

16:16.842 --> 16:18.598
Oriented to time.

16:19.050 --> 16:22.847
Shelly, can you spell "world"
backwards?

16:23.946 --> 16:28.256
U-O-Y
W-E-R-C-S.

16:30.507 --> 16:31.455
Screw you.

16:32.011 --> 16:32.741
Backwards.

16:33.162 --> 16:34.340
Right.

16:34.635 --> 16:36.457
Good concentration.

16:36.971 --> 16:39.753
Can you remember the things
I told you earlier?

16:40.043 --> 16:41.220
Yes.

16:41.802 --> 16:42.948
What are they?

16:43.402 --> 16:45.857
A fire engine, a pen, a mobile home.

16:46.123 --> 16:48.578
Now leave me alone, cornpone.

16:49.482 --> 16:51.173
She's oriented to person,
time and place.

16:51.402 --> 16:53.442
Her mental status exam is normal.

16:53.739 --> 16:55.910
She's uncooperative,
she speaks in rhyme...

16:56.171 --> 16:58.822
...and doesn't care that she
could die without treatment.

16:59.082 --> 17:01.984
There are criteria for competence.
She doesn't meet them.

17:02.250 --> 17:05.545
She's a woman with no I.D.,
found passed out in a restaurant.

17:05.801 --> 17:07.144
She doesn't meet the criteria.

17:07.402 --> 17:09.671
Do you realize your
decision could kill her?

17:10.185 --> 17:12.390
That kind of hyperbole
isn't very helpful.

17:12.683 --> 17:14.656
Patients have a right
to make bad decisions.

17:14.923 --> 17:18.338
- Not when they're demented.
- That's where we disagree.

17:20.171 --> 17:23.204
Get McDonald down here.
Tell him it's life or death.

17:29.290 --> 17:30.119
Dr. Benton?

17:30.379 --> 17:32.484
The Serena kid's in
second-degree heart block.

17:32.778 --> 17:33.891
Where's his chart?

17:34.123 --> 17:36.905
- Kenner's patient?
- Yeah, but Kenner's back in surgery.

17:39.211 --> 17:40.138
Where are the labs?

17:40.427 --> 17:42.215
- On the chart.
- The calcium's not here.

17:42.474 --> 17:43.587
It wasn't picked up.

17:43.819 --> 17:48.161
Give him 30 of Lasix, IV push, and run
a liter of saline to diurese him.

17:48.459 --> 17:49.320
Where's Gant?

17:49.579 --> 17:50.855
I don't know.

17:51.114 --> 17:53.765
Dr. Fogg at Cambridge did
a similar study with rodents...

17:53.994 --> 17:57.704
...and could double serum cortisol
with five minutes on the treadmill.

17:57.994 --> 18:00.449
- How many more minutes do I have?
- Fifteen.

18:00.714 --> 18:03.103
Dr. Weaver, I'm getting
a reading of 500 lux.

18:03.371 --> 18:05.738
- Put the goggles on her.
- Goggles?

18:05.995 --> 18:07.369
The lights approximate daylight.

18:07.626 --> 18:10.277
We wanna make sure your body
thinks it's night.

18:11.946 --> 18:12.994
What else do I have to do?

18:13.290 --> 18:16.454
One more exertion test, heart
and lung readings, and that's it.

18:16.971 --> 18:20.680
Wendy, let's take
the RPMs up to 90.

18:29.131 --> 18:30.854
I met the guy once last summer.

18:31.115 --> 18:33.384
Some type of mortgage broker.

18:34.699 --> 18:36.128
I don't know when
she started seeing him.

18:36.394 --> 18:39.264
Why are you here when a kid
is dying of hypercalcemia?

18:39.818 --> 18:41.640
You're supposed to monitor
his calcium.

18:41.962 --> 18:44.418
- I sent the labs in.
- Why, if you don't check them?

18:44.682 --> 18:45.544
It takes an hour.

18:45.834 --> 18:47.776
Look at this. 13.5!

18:48.010 --> 18:50.912
- He went into a bradyarrhythmia.
- I was going to get them.

18:51.179 --> 18:53.568
Gant, that kind of excuse
kills patients.

18:54.059 --> 18:56.993
If you can't do the job,
then you don't need to be here.

18:58.187 --> 19:00.904
Make another stupid
mistake like that, you won't be.

19:11.275 --> 19:13.314
Hey, you okay?

19:15.946 --> 19:18.150
It's a code.
I'm on the code team.

19:18.442 --> 19:21.410
Listen, we'll talk, all right?
We'll talk when I get back?

19:25.770 --> 19:27.876
It's weird, being down here again.

19:28.170 --> 19:29.893
Makes me realize how unhappy I was.

19:30.123 --> 19:31.366
When you were with me?

19:31.595 --> 19:35.042
It wasn't your fault.
I just didn't think much of myself.

19:35.339 --> 19:38.917
- I'm sure I didn't help.
- A lot of stuff didn't help.

19:39.179 --> 19:42.823
But it's just different now, you know?
I actually feel good.

19:43.082 --> 19:45.221
What's different besides us not
being together?

19:45.483 --> 19:47.719
I used to think I couldn't do things.

19:48.011 --> 19:49.352
Now I'm taking a pre-med course.

19:50.474 --> 19:52.962
I trust you did well
on your midterms.

19:53.226 --> 19:54.371
B plus.

19:54.635 --> 19:56.260
Clearly, you're not trying
hard enough.

19:58.571 --> 20:00.513
I guess it's about feeling in control.

20:00.778 --> 20:01.706
I guess.

20:01.963 --> 20:04.745
Of course,
there's things you can't control.

20:04.970 --> 20:06.214
Such as?

20:06.474 --> 20:09.027
Administration's making me
fire two nurses.

20:09.899 --> 20:11.808
- Really?
- But don't tell anyone.

20:12.074 --> 20:14.114
They don't know, and I
don't know who it'll be.

20:14.378 --> 20:16.418
I'm not gonna say a thing.

20:16.682 --> 20:18.438
You know what's really depressing?

20:18.731 --> 20:20.324
Being here right now...

20:20.586 --> 20:23.336
...makes me realize how much
happier I was back then.

20:24.970 --> 20:28.582
- God, you're pathetic.
- Yes.

20:34.122 --> 20:36.010
- You on the code team?
- I was gonna ask you.

20:36.267 --> 20:38.722
- Where the hell is A-360?
- I was gonna ask that too.

20:38.986 --> 20:41.256
Do you know where A-360 is?
Somebody's having a heart attack.

20:41.514 --> 20:44.417
Sorry. Have you seen the men's
room? A toilet overflowed.

20:44.682 --> 20:46.504
Nope. Can't help you.

20:47.787 --> 20:49.380
"290, 310.

20:50.571 --> 20:51.498
320.

20:51.754 --> 20:53.664
- 330."
- It must be this way.

20:58.442 --> 20:59.904
- I'll do the central line.
- I will.

21:00.171 --> 21:02.953
- Have you run a code before?
- More than you have.

21:07.210 --> 21:08.704
Well, here's the toilet.

21:10.538 --> 21:11.912
Code team? You're late.

21:12.170 --> 21:13.348
Oh, no!

21:18.890 --> 21:20.581
- I'll take over.
- I got it.

21:22.634 --> 21:23.779
He's got a rhythm.

21:24.074 --> 21:25.568
- I got a good pulse.
- Thank God!

21:25.835 --> 21:29.697
CPR course finally paid off.
Now, if I could just find that john!

21:29.962 --> 21:31.271
Dr. Carter will show you.

21:33.962 --> 21:36.232
- Know why I hate going to a shrink?
- Why?

21:36.490 --> 21:38.498
Because you have to
talk about yourself.

21:39.370 --> 21:40.614
That's the point, Doug.

21:40.874 --> 21:43.263
It's embarrassing.
I tell her about my patients.

21:43.530 --> 21:44.391
She lets you?

21:44.683 --> 21:48.709
She says I prefer talking about them
because solving their problems...

21:48.970 --> 21:50.280
...is easier than solving my own.

21:51.370 --> 21:52.482
It's probably true.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.883
Sometimes, yeah. Sometimes, no.

21:59.658 --> 22:02.047
You thinking about Charlie?

22:02.315 --> 22:04.137
I was tough on her today.

22:04.426 --> 22:06.663
Well, you know,
you gave her a chance.

22:06.890 --> 22:11.145
Several. There's a certain point
you just gotta say, "No. It's over."

22:13.098 --> 22:15.432
Why do those words
sound familiar to me?

22:26.923 --> 22:29.476
Conni and I wrote
a personal ad for you. Wanna hear?

22:29.738 --> 22:30.666
Sure.

22:30.922 --> 22:33.126
"Sensitive doctor.
Tall, white and handsome."

22:33.386 --> 22:35.175
- Handsome? Really?
- Sure. Why not?

22:35.722 --> 22:37.347
"Loves the Cubs and Kawasakis."

22:37.610 --> 22:40.512
Hold on. I own a bike,
I don't know if I love it.

22:40.810 --> 22:42.120
Chicks love guys with bikes.

22:42.314 --> 22:43.743
I got mine in the garage.

22:44.042 --> 22:44.806
Your bike?

22:45.066 --> 22:47.935
They let me keep it here.
But I haven't run it.

22:48.202 --> 22:50.438
- Your battery's gonna die.
- I gotta start it up.

22:51.658 --> 22:55.335
Don't mention the bike. I don't
wanna attract motorcycle chicks.

22:56.522 --> 22:57.667
Someone like me?

22:58.251 --> 22:59.745
No. I didn't mean...

23:00.042 --> 23:02.082
Shelly's gone
and so are her clothes.

23:02.314 --> 23:05.216
- Check the restrooms.
- I did that already.

23:05.482 --> 23:07.489
Did you see a female
patient leave here?

23:07.786 --> 23:08.899
Brown hair and red hat?

23:09.130 --> 23:10.210
She just left.

23:10.506 --> 23:11.367
I'll get Security.

23:11.626 --> 23:13.448
Could you grab my coat?

23:22.730 --> 23:25.512
Shelly? Shelly?

23:25.802 --> 23:28.136
Shelly, you need to come back inside.

23:28.362 --> 23:29.704
I want the bus.

23:29.962 --> 23:30.977
Listen to me.

23:31.242 --> 23:33.893
You're very sick.
We need to treat you.

23:34.154 --> 23:35.878
- Right away.
- Go away.

23:36.138 --> 23:37.764
Shelly, come on.

23:39.338 --> 23:42.120
Put me down!
I wanna go on the bus!

23:44.170 --> 23:45.381
Put me down!

23:45.610 --> 23:48.392
Help! Help!

23:53.290 --> 23:54.664
Why are you hurting me?

23:54.922 --> 23:57.224
Grab her legs.
Chuny, take her shoulders.

23:57.546 --> 23:59.968
Malik, bring her knees
up to her chest.

24:00.266 --> 24:01.924
What are you doing?

24:02.346 --> 24:04.288
I'm gonna give you
a shot to numb the skin.

24:04.522 --> 24:06.278
No! No needles, please!

24:09.258 --> 24:10.534
I don't see a psych hold.

24:10.794 --> 24:12.966
- Help me.
- I got tired of waiting.

24:16.619 --> 24:17.731
Hold still.

24:18.698 --> 24:20.007
I want everyone's names.

24:20.234 --> 24:21.794
- Chuny Marquez.
- Lydia Wright.

24:22.090 --> 24:22.853
Malik McGrath.

24:23.082 --> 24:24.326
No, please!

24:31.434 --> 24:32.961
I got fluid.

24:33.962 --> 24:37.410
There I was, baring my soul
in a way I never really had before.

24:37.674 --> 24:41.384
- All of a sudden, I hear snoring.
- I'm sorry. I'm so tired.

24:41.642 --> 24:45.090
Oh, God! I've got 51/2 hours
to make my big staff decision.

24:45.354 --> 24:47.012
- What am I gonna do?
- Sorry, what?

24:47.274 --> 24:48.518
You're hilarious.

24:48.778 --> 24:50.501
Oh, my God!

24:51.338 --> 24:52.450
Charlie?

24:52.714 --> 24:53.924
Get a gurney! Let's go!

24:54.186 --> 24:55.015
What happened?

24:55.274 --> 24:57.761
- He found me.
- The pimp? Hang on.

24:58.026 --> 24:59.782
Get the gurney, Conni!

25:01.770 --> 25:02.850
Benton was out of line.

25:03.114 --> 25:04.707
- Was he?
- Way out of line.

25:05.066 --> 25:09.256
- I feel like punching out the bastard.
- Well, that would be unwise.

25:09.546 --> 25:11.488
I suppose I could tell Anspaugh...

25:11.722 --> 25:14.756
...but then again, I don't know.
I think Benton's right.

25:15.050 --> 25:18.847
Lately, I've been one step behind,
five minutes too late.

25:19.114 --> 25:20.325
See you.

25:21.802 --> 25:23.590
- Aren't you covering the ER?
- It's dead.

25:23.850 --> 25:26.501
What I wouldn't give
for a good five-car pileup.

25:28.202 --> 25:29.729
It's 3:00.

25:31.978 --> 25:34.312
Time for the
<i>Charlie Chan Mystery Movie.</i>

25:38.186 --> 25:39.647
What's the point of this exactly?

25:39.882 --> 25:42.817
To compare your cortisol
after indoor and outdoor exertion.

25:43.114 --> 25:45.503
- That's it?
- No more sweating after this.

25:45.770 --> 25:47.712
Get your knees up, like a drum major.

25:47.978 --> 25:49.538
That's it. There you go.

25:49.802 --> 25:51.624
Go! Go! Go!

25:53.610 --> 25:55.683
Okay, sweetheart.
Squeeze this hand.

25:55.946 --> 25:58.728
Good. All right.
Now squeeze this hand.

25:59.690 --> 26:01.632
That's okay. That's all right.

26:01.898 --> 26:05.313
- I think she's got a broken right ulna.
- Ears are clear.

26:05.578 --> 26:07.683
Can you move your jaw for me?
Side to side.

26:07.946 --> 26:08.742
It hurts.

26:09.002 --> 26:11.457
That's okay.
You're gonna be fine.

26:11.754 --> 26:13.925
Let's get a panorex.
She's got a broken jaw.

26:14.154 --> 26:18.180
Let's get a film of the chest,
right arm, orbits.

26:23.945 --> 26:27.294
She has bruising around her groin.
She may have been raped.

26:31.402 --> 26:32.776
All right, kiddo.

26:34.474 --> 26:35.783
It's okay.

26:38.794 --> 26:40.867
Your idea's gonna
make you a millionaire?

26:41.130 --> 26:42.656
- Money in the bank.
- Let's hear it.

26:42.922 --> 26:44.100
Flypaper in a can.

26:44.394 --> 26:47.329
Like aerosol. You spray it on
your car so bugs stick to it.

26:47.562 --> 26:49.864
You peel off one big sheet.
Then boom!

26:50.154 --> 26:52.259
- Your car is clean.
- You're kidding, right?

26:52.490 --> 26:55.338
- I'll call it "Bug Off."
- That's the dumbest idea ever.

26:55.594 --> 26:57.252
Why not just clean it off
with a hose?

26:57.514 --> 27:00.863
Okay, I got another one.
Stethoscope condoms.

27:01.130 --> 27:02.178
I don't even want to know.

27:02.442 --> 27:04.384
Take my advice.
Don't quit your day job.

27:11.914 --> 27:13.059
How's it going?

27:13.322 --> 27:14.467
Dr. Kenner.

27:14.730 --> 27:17.151
We had a scare.
His calcium went up to 13.5...

27:17.418 --> 27:19.141
...which sent him into heart block.

27:19.402 --> 27:22.882
I had to diurese him.
I got him back to a normal sinus.

27:29.098 --> 27:31.170
Well, it looks fine now.

27:31.434 --> 27:33.768
- Good work.
- Thank you.

27:38.282 --> 27:41.348
I'd like to do another
Pediatric rotation...

27:41.609 --> 27:43.365
...and I'd like to do it with you.

27:44.618 --> 27:46.341
Correct me if I'm wrong.

27:46.602 --> 27:49.384
I understood that Dr. Keaton
isn't recommending you.

27:50.186 --> 27:51.593
She told you that?

27:51.850 --> 27:55.233
Well, it is a pretty small club.
We do talk occasionally.

27:55.530 --> 27:59.240
Dr. Kenner, I learned a lot
from Dr. Keaton...

27:59.497 --> 28:03.688
...but our styles were very different.
We didn't quite mesh.

28:05.930 --> 28:09.858
Why don't you talk to her
and tell her your perspective...

28:10.122 --> 28:12.675
...about not meshing and so on.

28:13.641 --> 28:16.129
- Maybe she'll reconsider.
- And if she did?

28:17.034 --> 28:18.211
Then we could talk.

28:20.426 --> 28:22.979
Without a recommendation,
I really can't help you.

28:29.322 --> 28:30.304
Where am I going?

28:30.954 --> 28:32.710
To Radiology to take x-rays.

28:32.970 --> 28:36.767
We'll use a machine called a CAT scan
to make sure your head's okay.

28:37.738 --> 28:38.567
I'm scared.

28:39.530 --> 28:41.188
It's okay.
I'll come with you.

28:46.985 --> 28:48.098
Hang on.

28:49.322 --> 28:50.783
Want me to get a rape kit?

28:51.050 --> 28:53.417
I'm gonna talk to her
and see what happened.

29:03.434 --> 29:05.889
- Which bone would you choose?
- Maybe a finger.

29:06.122 --> 29:09.089
If I had to choose a bone to
break, I'd choose a clavicle.

29:09.354 --> 29:11.045
That's good.
No surgical intervention.

29:11.306 --> 29:14.721
- I'd go with a skull fracture.
- Oh, you would!

29:14.985 --> 29:16.033
Crazy!

29:16.297 --> 29:17.988
"Venture to Karachi on the rugged...

29:18.250 --> 29:21.097
...Grand Trunk Road which,
while breathtaking...

29:21.353 --> 29:23.972
...is prone to landslides
and firefights...

29:24.233 --> 29:26.819
...by warring sectarian factions."

29:28.938 --> 29:29.985
Abby, don't go.

29:30.282 --> 29:32.289
Put the book down.

29:33.802 --> 29:34.663
Dr. Keaton?

29:34.954 --> 29:37.157
- Did you lock the door?
- I thought you did.

29:37.417 --> 29:38.345
Dr. Keaton, l...

29:43.338 --> 29:45.410
Peter, could you wait
outside, please?

29:55.786 --> 29:59.135
- Anything?
- Just doing the ink stain now.

29:59.401 --> 30:01.768
I admire you, Dr. Greene.
That took guts.

30:02.058 --> 30:03.684
Thank you for your support.

30:03.945 --> 30:07.840
Don't worry about that lawyer.
I'm going to take full responsibility.

30:08.106 --> 30:09.928
They can't fire all of us.

30:12.106 --> 30:16.448
Sorry if I offended you earlier
with that motorcycle crack.

30:16.746 --> 30:17.956
It takes a lot to offend me.

30:18.218 --> 30:22.887
But seriously, I'd be lucky
to find someone like you.

30:24.713 --> 30:26.274
Wanna get the lights?

30:36.937 --> 30:38.498
Is it meningitis?

30:39.721 --> 30:41.827
Cryptococcus.

30:42.058 --> 30:43.716
You were right.

30:55.466 --> 30:57.059
Randi, have you seen
a black binder?

30:57.290 --> 30:59.112
The nursing budget?

30:59.402 --> 31:01.704
It fell out of the cubby,
so I looked at it.

31:01.930 --> 31:03.140
Well, where is it?

31:04.298 --> 31:05.956
Bad news for some people, huh?

31:06.218 --> 31:08.192
- You shouldn't have looked.
- I was curious.

31:08.458 --> 31:10.280
I took an accounting course.

31:10.537 --> 31:12.642
Well, that's no excuse.

31:15.626 --> 31:18.692
- It's the overtime that's killing you.
- What?

31:18.954 --> 31:22.249
ER nurses work 12-hour shifts.
After eight hours, they get overtime.

31:22.505 --> 31:25.734
- It's screwing with your budget.
- I don't know what else we can do.

31:25.993 --> 31:30.150
Put everybody on 8-hour shifts.
You'll save a hundred grand a year.

31:37.706 --> 31:41.667
I know teacher/intern relationships
can undermine reputations.

31:41.930 --> 31:44.068
The innuendo and rumors.

31:45.066 --> 31:47.749
I need to know if you'll be
discreet about this.

31:48.010 --> 31:51.206
I came by to see if you'd reconsider
writing me a recommendation.

31:53.514 --> 31:56.929
You've always complimented
my surgical skills...

31:57.194 --> 32:01.154
...and with a recommendation, I could
get another Pediatric rotation.

32:01.417 --> 32:02.432
And if I don't?

32:05.098 --> 32:06.472
What do you mean, if you don't?

32:07.210 --> 32:10.145
Will you report my relationship
with Dr. Carter?

32:12.329 --> 32:13.638
You think I'm threatening you?

32:14.730 --> 32:15.657
Are you?

32:19.561 --> 32:23.936
If your recommendation isn't based
on my abilities as a doctor...

32:24.809 --> 32:26.238
...I don't want it.

32:30.473 --> 32:32.197
I can't do that, Peter.

32:33.001 --> 32:36.482
You've got the makings
of an excellent surgeon...

32:36.745 --> 32:39.112
...but not a pediatric surgeon.

32:54.602 --> 32:57.471
Dr. Greene, another letter from Legal.

32:57.738 --> 33:00.356
What do you know?
I've been written up again.

33:00.618 --> 33:01.862
Twice in one night.

33:02.153 --> 33:04.390
They cc'd Anspaugh.
That was very thoughtful.

33:04.618 --> 33:05.381
Jerks.

33:05.641 --> 33:09.351
Why don't I just get some frames
and put these up on the wall?

33:09.610 --> 33:11.039
You should do it.

33:11.722 --> 33:14.591
- This is George Dunleavy.
- What can I do for you?

33:14.858 --> 33:17.891
The police said that you
may have found my sister, Shelly.

33:19.402 --> 33:21.638
A couple of days ago,
she said she was sick.

33:21.865 --> 33:23.294
I told her to see a doctor.

33:24.425 --> 33:26.432
I haven't heard from her since.

33:26.698 --> 33:29.153
Does your sister have any
psychiatric problems?

33:31.401 --> 33:33.474
She was pretty incoherent.

33:33.770 --> 33:36.258
Meningitis can cause
temporary dementia.

33:36.490 --> 33:37.919
Will she be all right?

33:38.185 --> 33:41.349
Take a day or two,
but she should be fine.

33:42.346 --> 33:44.517
- Thank you, doctor.
- Sure.

33:54.857 --> 33:58.370
I want you to know, Dr. Keaton
and I never talked about you.

33:58.633 --> 34:01.862
We never said anything about you
remotely negative, ever.

34:02.121 --> 34:05.187
Carter, it never occurred
to me that you had.

34:07.722 --> 34:09.630
We were just talking about you.

34:09.898 --> 34:13.760
Dr. Gant feels that you've treated
him inappropriately in public.

34:14.056 --> 34:16.958
Calling him lazy and stupid,
I understand?

34:17.225 --> 34:19.047
I said what he did
was lazy and stupid.

34:19.304 --> 34:22.567
It wasn't inappropriate.
His inattention almost killed a child.

34:22.857 --> 34:23.588
That's not true.

34:23.849 --> 34:24.797
You neglected your duties.

34:25.065 --> 34:27.847
If you feel that way, speak
to me. Don't yell at me in public.

34:28.105 --> 34:29.382
All right, settle down.

34:31.114 --> 34:32.543
You were there, weren't you?

34:33.578 --> 34:36.360
Do you feel Dr. Benton's reaction
was inappropriate?

34:40.618 --> 34:44.262
His language was strong, and I can
understand how Dennis feels.

34:46.185 --> 34:47.974
But given the circumstances...

34:49.161 --> 34:51.364
...I'm not sure
I'd call it inappropriate.

34:52.617 --> 34:56.033
Sounds like you have to
develop thicker skin, Dr. Gant.

34:56.297 --> 34:58.469
And if similar issues arise
in the future...

34:58.698 --> 35:01.862
...I suggest you take them up
with Dr. Benton directly...

35:02.153 --> 35:03.713
...before you come crying to me.

35:19.978 --> 35:23.971
The hard truth is, there's no money.
They want me to let people go.

35:24.266 --> 35:25.891
- So who gets fired?
- Nobody.

35:26.153 --> 35:29.797
I sent up a proposal that solves
our problems without losing jobs.

35:30.026 --> 35:32.098
- You cutting back hours?
- No.

35:32.361 --> 35:35.973
Instead of three 12-hour shifts,
everyone will work five 8-hour shifts.

35:36.234 --> 35:37.859
For the same money?

35:38.121 --> 35:39.233
A little less.

35:40.234 --> 35:43.103
But we have to work
four hours more a week.

35:43.370 --> 35:44.318
That sucks.

35:45.130 --> 35:46.788
Or two of you are history.

35:47.050 --> 35:48.806
- I don't buy that.
- They got the money.

35:49.066 --> 35:50.953
I'm not giving up my OT.

35:51.209 --> 35:54.176
None of us are. We got a contract
negotiation coming up.

35:54.409 --> 35:56.231
Management pulls this, we walk.

35:56.489 --> 35:57.984
That's right.

36:15.817 --> 36:18.053
I didn't think you'd
really go to Anspaugh.

36:18.857 --> 36:20.286
Look, I'm sorry.

36:20.521 --> 36:21.568
Don't worry about it.

36:22.218 --> 36:25.152
I didn't know what to say.
And with Benton standing there...

36:25.450 --> 36:28.003
John, it's okay. I didn't mean
to put you on the spot.

36:30.985 --> 36:32.098
So we're cool?

36:32.874 --> 36:34.400
Yeah, we're cool.

36:36.425 --> 36:39.043
I'd better get back to the ER.
I'll see you later.

36:54.825 --> 36:59.495
It's like an x-ray of your head.
There's nothing to be afraid of.

37:00.874 --> 37:03.721
- Will you stay with me?
- I'm gonna be in the next room.

37:07.913 --> 37:09.604
Charlie, were you raped?

37:13.865 --> 37:15.687
Promise you won't tell the cops?

37:15.978 --> 37:17.800
I'm not gonna tell anybody.

37:27.913 --> 37:28.774
You'll be okay.

37:30.057 --> 37:31.137
Here we go.

37:36.073 --> 37:37.502
Okay, let's see.

37:42.825 --> 37:44.897
Hey, Mark! Mark!

37:47.017 --> 37:48.926
You forgot your curriculum vitae.

37:49.226 --> 37:50.655
Thanks!

37:50.921 --> 37:54.085
After tonight, I figure my chances
for making tenure are about nil.

37:54.345 --> 37:56.767
But I did my job,
and I can do my job somewhere.

37:57.033 --> 37:58.724
- Tenure or no tenure.
- Same here.

37:58.985 --> 38:01.603
They're messing with our overtime.
I'll go someplace else.

38:01.865 --> 38:03.872
- That's the spirit!
- I gotta go.

38:04.169 --> 38:07.104
Chuny, you hungry?
Wanna grab some breakfast with me?

38:07.561 --> 38:08.292
Sure.

38:08.553 --> 38:12.230
First I gotta take the bike for
a spin just to charge the battery.

38:12.457 --> 38:14.083
Why don't I charge it up with you?

38:14.345 --> 38:15.970
Sure. Hop on!

38:26.601 --> 38:27.878
You want me to get in this box?

38:28.169 --> 38:30.111
"This box" is a body plethysmograph.

38:30.377 --> 38:33.639
- It accurately measures lung capacity.
- Why is that important?

38:33.898 --> 38:37.159
I need accurate specifications,
or I can't correlate the data.

38:37.385 --> 38:38.629
I'm sorry.
I get claustrophobic.

38:38.921 --> 38:40.743
Look at all the windows.
You can look out.

38:40.970 --> 38:42.213
I'm sorry. I can't.

38:42.441 --> 38:45.507
If you don't, I have to
throw out two months' work.

38:45.801 --> 38:47.459
- I'm not getting in.
- You're getting $50.

38:47.721 --> 38:48.736
- Shut up.
- Please?

38:49.002 --> 38:50.758
I'm sorry. It's final.
I can't.

38:51.945 --> 38:53.374
How about that?

38:53.641 --> 38:54.721
- Wendy.
- What?

38:55.018 --> 38:56.228
- Get in the box.
- Me?

38:56.457 --> 38:58.846
We'll test lung volume.
Then get on the bike.

38:59.113 --> 39:00.454
But it's almost daylight.

39:00.745 --> 39:03.745
Here, wear the goggles.
You won't know the difference.

39:09.705 --> 39:10.949
How is she?

39:12.809 --> 39:16.486
She's got a broken arm,
a lot of bruises.

39:17.225 --> 39:19.527
A concussion. She was raped.

39:19.785 --> 39:21.410
I'll get a kit
and call the police.

39:21.673 --> 39:23.266
When does the social worker
get here?

39:23.529 --> 39:26.049
They should be on now.
You want me to call?

39:29.865 --> 39:31.491
No. I'll do it.

39:49.482 --> 39:51.270
The eggs are burning.

39:52.137 --> 39:55.749
Oh, well. We'll just have
to make some more.

40:00.137 --> 40:01.185
I didn't call a surgeon.

40:01.449 --> 40:04.962
We finally got a good one.
Some guy got hit by the EI.

40:06.857 --> 40:09.378
- What you got?
- You got a mess. Take a look.

40:10.921 --> 40:12.382
Yuck! Which end is up?

40:12.617 --> 40:14.243
Jumped or fell in front of a train.

40:14.505 --> 40:17.636
Open skull fracture, multiple
extremity fractures, flailed chest.

40:17.897 --> 40:20.068
- Any signs of life?
- He's got a weak pulse.

40:20.329 --> 40:22.216
Now all he needs is a face.

40:23.785 --> 40:26.174
He's 60/40.
He ain't gonna last.

40:26.441 --> 40:28.830
Everybody, grab hold
on my count. 1, 2, 3!

40:29.098 --> 40:31.464
- What is this?
- Man versus moving El train.

40:31.721 --> 40:32.649
Suicide?

40:32.938 --> 40:34.498
He either jumped or tripped.

40:34.761 --> 40:35.524
Lost the pulse.

40:35.785 --> 40:38.119
Put O-neg on the rapid infuser.
Set up a central line.

40:38.345 --> 40:40.450
Page Gant. He's supposed to be
covering the ER.

40:40.745 --> 40:42.632
- I'll do it.
- How are his eyes?

40:42.889 --> 40:44.712
He's lost one,
and the other's swollen shut.

40:44.937 --> 40:46.311
Gray matter in the hair.

40:46.601 --> 40:47.681
Increased breath sounds.

40:47.913 --> 40:48.742
I'll put in a tube.

40:49.001 --> 40:50.311
It's a surgical procedure.

40:50.569 --> 40:51.998
- 32 French.
- Whose beeper?

40:52.265 --> 40:53.247
It's coming from him.

40:53.513 --> 40:55.553
- 10 blade.
- What number did you page Gant to?

40:55.817 --> 40:57.312
This room, 3376.

40:57.577 --> 40:59.170
That's the number on this pager.

41:01.257 --> 41:03.199
Oh, my God! The patient.

41:03.625 --> 41:05.119
It's Gant.

41:06.793 --> 41:07.905
Dennis?

41:09.769 --> 41:11.111
Oh, sweet Jesus!

41:11.401 --> 41:12.710
Carter, put the tube in!

41:13.481 --> 41:14.659
Seal him with thoraseal!
Move!

41:16.361 --> 41:18.695
- Flat line.
- Give me an amp of epi...

41:18.953 --> 41:21.026
...and atropine.
Let's go, Carter!

41:21.257 --> 41:22.205
I'm trying!

41:22.441 --> 41:24.099
Get it in! Get it in!

41:24.393 --> 41:25.440
It's in.

41:28.969 --> 41:30.082
Come on.

41:31.305 --> 41:37.306
