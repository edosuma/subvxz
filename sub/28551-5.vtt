ULANA KHOMYUK: I found this
in the state archive.

00:16.426 --> 00:17.426
I need your help.

00:17.635 --> 00:20.051
Can you confirm
that the reactor exploded

00:20.134 --> 00:22.217
after they attempted
to shut it down?

00:22.301 --> 00:23.509
What, you think
the right question

00:23.593 --> 00:24.801
will get you the truth?

VALERY LEGASOV: They're going
to put Dyatlov on trial.

00:28.092 --> 00:31.051
We're going to be asked
to give expert testimony.

00:31.259 --> 00:32.718
KHOMYUK:
I've analyzed the data.

00:32.926 --> 00:35.760
They shut the reactor down,
and then it exploded.

00:36.760 --> 00:37.885
You've seen this before.

00:37.967 --> 00:40.051
I had no idea it could cause
an explosion.

-BORIS SHCHERBINA:
So, it is their fault?
-LEGASOV: Yes.

00:42.051 --> 00:43.176
KHOMYUK:
But not only their fault.

00:43.259 --> 00:44.885
SHCHERBINA:
We can make a deal with the KGB.

00:44.967 --> 00:46.843
You'll leave this information
out in Vienna.

00:46.926 --> 00:49.676
They quietly let us
fix the remaining reactors.

00:49.760 --> 00:51.926
KHOMYUK: You have a chance
to talk to the world.

00:52.426 --> 00:54.259
Someone has to start
telling the truth.

This little problem we have
with the safety test...

03:36.343 --> 03:40.092

03:40.176 --> 03:43.926
yes, I think promotion's
very likely.

03:44.009 --> 03:46.176
Who knows, maybe Moscow.

03:48.009 --> 03:50.384
Naturally, they'll put me
in charge once he's gone,

03:50.468 --> 03:53.509
and then I'll need someone
to take my old job.

03:55.301 --> 03:57.593
I could pick Sitnikov.

04:06.301 --> 04:08.468
I would like to be considered.

04:11.593 --> 04:13.176
I'll keep that in mind.

Viktor Petrovich,

04:16.635 --> 04:18.885
preparations for the test
have gone smoothly.

04:18.967 --> 04:22.217
Comrade Dyatlov's been
working per my instructions,

04:22.301 --> 04:26.551
and Reactor 4 output's been
reduced to 1600 megawatts.

04:26.635 --> 04:30.134
With your approval,
we're ready to continue
lowering power to--

04:30.217 --> 04:32.009
We have to wait.

04:33.092 --> 04:34.426

there's a problem, Nikolai?

04:37.509 --> 04:39.760
You can't read
a fucking face?

04:39.843 --> 04:42.384
Three years,
I've tried to finish this test.

04:42.468 --> 04:44.009
Three years.

04:50.843 --> 04:53.092
I've just had a call from
the grid controller in Kiev.

04:53.176 --> 04:55.426
He says we can't
lower power any further,

04:55.509 --> 04:56.676
not for another
ten hours.

04:56.760 --> 04:58.551
The grid controller?
Where does he get off--

04:58.635 --> 05:02.551
It's not the grid
controller's decision,
Dyatlov.

05:02.635 --> 05:04.676
It's the end of the month.

05:04.760 --> 05:07.384
All the productivity quotas.

05:07.468 --> 05:10.217
Everyone's working overtime,
the factories need power.

05:10.301 --> 05:12.176
Someone's pushing
down from above.

05:12.259 --> 05:14.843
Although,
we'll never know who.

05:22.384 --> 05:24.676
So, do we have to scrap it
or what?

05:24.760 --> 05:27.134
No, I don't think so.

05:27.217 --> 05:29.134
If we need to wait
ten hours,

05:29.217 --> 05:30.843
-we wait
-Running at half power,

05:30.926 --> 05:33.217
we're not going to have
stability issues?

05:33.301 --> 05:36.551
-No, I-I should think--
-I'm not asking you.

05:39.176 --> 05:40.509
Dyatlov:
It's safe.

05:40.593 --> 05:42.134
We'll maintain at 1600.

05:42.217 --> 05:44.801
I'll go home, get some sleep,
come back tonight.

05:44.885 --> 05:46.843
We'll proceed then.

05:46.926 --> 05:49.217
I'll personally
supervise the test.

05:49.301 --> 05:51.801
And it will be completed.

05:55.468 --> 05:58.217
Well, I'm not waiting
around then.

05:58.301 --> 05:59.801
Call me when it's done.

You went

07:42.217 --> 07:44.343
How is your health?

07:44.426 --> 07:46.635
You don't know?

07:47.760 --> 07:49.301
From Vienna.

07:49.384 --> 07:50.926
Do you read German?

07:52.426 --> 07:57.926
It says, "At last a Soviet
scientist who tells the truth."

07:58.009 --> 07:59.843
Obviously, I resent
the insinuation,

07:59.926 --> 08:03.551
but I think it's fair to say,
you made an excellent
impression at the conference.

08:03.635 --> 08:06.635
Turns out,
you're quite good at this.

08:06.718 --> 08:08.593
At what? Lying?

08:08.676 --> 08:11.676
Statecraft, Legasov.
Statecraft.

08:11.760 --> 08:14.176
The West is now satisfied

08:14.259 --> 08:17.217
that Chernobyl was solely
the result of operator error,

08:17.301 --> 08:19.301
which it essentially was.

08:19.384 --> 08:21.301
We have you
to thank for that,

08:21.384 --> 08:23.051
and we intend to.

08:27.092 --> 08:29.551
"Hero of the Soviet Union."

08:29.635 --> 08:31.676
Our highest honor.

08:31.760 --> 08:34.509
They haven't even
given it to me.

08:34.593 --> 08:38.593
"Promotion to Director
of the Kurchatov Institute."

08:41.051 --> 08:42.635
I'm humbled.

08:42.718 --> 08:47.259
I don't think there's
anything humble about you,
Valery Alexeyevich.

08:47.343 --> 08:49.801
These rewards are
not yours yet.

08:49.885 --> 08:51.635
First, your testimony
at the trial.

08:51.718 --> 08:56.885
Comrade Charkov,
I understand my duty
to the State.

08:56.967 --> 08:59.635
But you gave us
assurances.

08:59.718 --> 09:02.134
The reactors
would be made safe.

09:02.217 --> 09:04.635
It's been months,
no changes have been made.

09:04.718 --> 09:08.384
-No changes even discussed.
-First, the trial.

09:09.593 --> 09:11.926
Once it's over,
we will have our villains,

09:12.009 --> 09:16.051
we will have our hero,
we will have our truth.

09:16.134 --> 09:19.676
After that, we can deal
with the reactors.

09:41.801 --> 09:43.926
(clock ticking)

10:28.092 --> 10:30.176
(loud knocking)

10:30.259 --> 10:32.176
(sighs)

10:44.176 --> 10:46.092
Did you take a train?

10:46.176 --> 10:48.926
Yes, I took a train.

10:49.009 --> 10:51.843
Now let's talk about Vienna.

10:51.926 --> 10:53.967
I'm not here to scold you.

10:54.051 --> 10:57.718
I know how the world works
despite what Shcherbina says.

10:58.926 --> 11:02.301
So... why are you here?

11:02.384 --> 11:05.301
Because I'm
brutally stubborn.

11:05.384 --> 11:07.593
Which you were
hoping for.

11:11.384 --> 11:15.801
Charkov is saying
they're going to fix
the reactors after the trial.

11:17.426 --> 11:18.926
Do you believe him?

11:19.009 --> 11:20.301
(scoffs)

11:21.967 --> 11:24.009
The State will never
willingly fix the reactors,

11:24.092 --> 11:27.718
because acknowledging
the problem means
admitting that they lied.

11:27.801 --> 11:29.718
They will have to be forced.

11:36.718 --> 11:40.426
At the trial,
you're going to tell the truth.

11:41.760 --> 11:43.885
You're going
to convince the jury.

11:43.967 --> 11:46.217
(scoffing):
It's a show trial.

11:46.301 --> 11:50.426
-The jury's already
been handed their verdict.
-I'm not talking about them.

11:52.092 --> 11:53.801
The Central Committee
have invited

11:53.885 --> 11:57.509
members of
the scientific community
to observe the trial.

11:57.593 --> 12:01.259
Our colleagues,
from Kurchatov,

12:01.343 --> 12:03.384
from Sredmash,
from Minenergo,

12:03.468 --> 12:07.176
they will be sitting
in the crowd listening
to every word you say.

12:07.259 --> 12:09.343
A jury that only
we know is there.

12:09.426 --> 12:13.509
And when your testimony arrives
at the moment of the explosion?

12:15.134 --> 12:18.635
That is when our jury will
finally hear the truth.

12:18.718 --> 12:21.509
-And do what with it?
-Insist on reform.

12:21.593 --> 12:23.092
(scoffs)

12:23.176 --> 12:26.718
-Not just to the RBMK,
but the entire industry.
-No, no, no, no, no.

12:26.801 --> 12:29.217
-They can't function
without us.
-No, no, no.

12:29.301 --> 12:31.509
Do you know
what happened to Volkov

12:31.593 --> 12:34.051
the man whose
report you found?

12:34.134 --> 12:38.843
They just removed him from
his position at the Institute.

12:38.926 --> 12:42.051
Sacked for the crime
of knowing.

12:42.134 --> 12:44.426
And you think that
these scientists,

12:44.509 --> 12:47.259
handpicked to witness
a show trial,

12:47.343 --> 12:50.967
will somehow be stirred
into action by me?

12:51.051 --> 12:55.092
Because of some heroic stance
I take in defiance of the State?

12:55.176 --> 12:57.051
-Yes.
-Why?

12:57.134 --> 13:01.092
Because you're Valery Legasov,
and you mean something.

13:02.051 --> 13:05.843
-(scoffs)
-I'd like to think that if I
spoke out, it would be enough.

13:07.009 --> 13:09.509
But I know
how the world works.

13:12.217 --> 13:15.468
They will shoot me, Khomyuk.

13:18.343 --> 13:21.551
You told me
to find out what happened.

13:21.635 --> 13:23.760
I spoke to dozens of people.

13:23.843 --> 13:28.384
Every word they said,
I wrote down.

13:28.468 --> 13:30.801
All in these books.

13:30.885 --> 13:32.551
These are the ones
who are still alive.

13:32.635 --> 13:34.301
These are the ones
who are dead.

13:34.384 --> 13:35.967
They died rescuing each other.

13:36.051 --> 13:39.259
Putting out fires,
tending to the wounded.

13:39.343 --> 13:41.134
They didn't hesitate,
they didn't waiver.

13:41.217 --> 13:43.384
They simply did
what had to be done.

13:43.468 --> 13:45.718
So have I.

13:45.801 --> 13:47.635
So have I.

13:47.718 --> 13:50.635
I went willingly
to an open reactor.

13:50.718 --> 13:54.009
So I've already
given my life.

13:54.092 --> 13:56.217
Isn't that enough?

13:57.718 --> 14:00.885
No, I'm sorry,
but it is not.

15:09.343 --> 15:12.259
The Central Committee
of the Communist Party
of the Soviet Union

15:12.343 --> 15:15.343
and the Presidium of the
Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.

15:15.426 --> 15:17.343
has determined that
justice be carried out

15:17.426 --> 15:18.843
on behalf of the People

15:18.926 --> 15:21.426
in accordance with
the general goal of our Party

15:21.509 --> 15:25.217
as determined by its 20th,
21st, and 22nd Congresses,

15:25.301 --> 15:27.217
which is a Leninist goal.

15:27.301 --> 15:28.509
It was, is, and will be

15:28.593 --> 15:31.259
the only immutable goal
in the Soviet state.

15:31.343 --> 15:32.635
The path of Leninist principles

15:32.718 --> 15:35.426
shall be consistently
and undeviatingly followed

15:35.509 --> 15:38.760
as it expresses the vital
interests of the Soviet People,

15:38.843 --> 15:40.092
its hopes and aspirations

15:40.176 --> 15:42.343
as we guide the life
of the Party and the State.

15:42.426 --> 15:44.635
This session of court
is now open,

15:44.718 --> 15:47.843
Comrade Judge Milan
Kadnikov presiding.

15:49.343 --> 15:50.509
Indictments:

15:50.593 --> 15:52.635
Viktor Bryukhanov,

15:52.718 --> 15:54.926
Anatoly Dyatlov,

15:55.009 --> 15:56.926
Nikolai Fomin...

15:57.009 --> 15:59.967
are accused of violating
Article 220 Section 2

16:00.051 --> 16:02.092
of the Criminal Code
of the Soviet Union,

16:02.176 --> 16:07.217
resulting in a nuclear disaster
on April 26, 1986.

16:07.301 --> 16:09.801
The State calls witnesses
Comrade Khomyuk

16:09.885 --> 16:12.259
of the Byelorussian
Nuclear Institute,

16:12.343 --> 16:16.426
Comrade Legasov of the Kurchatov
Institute of Atomic Energy,

16:16.509 --> 16:21.092
and Comrade Boris
Evdokimovich Shcherbina,

16:21.176 --> 16:23.593
Deputy Chairman of
the Council of Ministers

16:23.676 --> 16:27.217
and head of the Bureau
for Fuel and Energy.

17:01.092 --> 17:06.676
It began with, of all things,
a safety test.

17:06.760 --> 17:09.676
Why was there need
for a safety test at all?

17:09.760 --> 17:14.009
Reactor Number 4 was not new
when the accident occurred.

17:14.092 --> 17:19.635
In fact, it went into operation
on December 20th, 1983.

17:19.718 --> 17:23.676
Eleven days later,
on the last day of the year,

17:23.760 --> 17:28.509
Plant Director Viktor Bryukhanov
signed this document--

17:28.593 --> 17:34.926
certifying the completion of
the construction of the reactor.

17:36.593 --> 17:40.967
As a result of finishing
the work before
the end of the year,

17:41.051 --> 17:44.801
Comrade Bryukhanov was awarded
Hero of Socialist Labor.

17:44.885 --> 17:49.551
Comrade Fomin was awarded
for Valorous Labor.

17:49.635 --> 17:54.301
Comrade Dyatlov was given
an Order of the Red Banner.

17:56.217 --> 17:58.843
But their work was not finished.

18:00.384 --> 18:04.593
And this document was a lie.

18:04.676 --> 18:07.551
In order to sign
this certificate,

18:07.635 --> 18:12.009
all safety tests had to have
been successfully completed,

18:12.092 --> 18:15.217
and yet, one remained.

18:17.259 --> 18:22.426
A nuclear reactor generates
heat in the core here.

18:22.509 --> 18:24.718
A series of pumps,
here and here,

18:24.801 --> 18:28.259
send a constant flow
of cooling water
through the core.

18:28.343 --> 18:30.801
The core's heat turns
the water to steam,

18:30.885 --> 18:33.259
and the steam spins
the turbine here,

18:33.343 --> 18:35.635
and the result is electricity.

18:35.718 --> 18:39.468
But what if a power plant
has no power?

18:40.343 --> 18:43.926
What if the power feeding
the plant itself is disrupted?

18:44.009 --> 18:46.551
A blackout, equipment failure,

18:46.635 --> 18:49.426
or an attack
by a foreign enemy?

18:49.509 --> 18:51.301
If there's no power,

18:51.384 --> 18:54.259
the pumps cannot move
water through the core.

18:54.343 --> 18:57.134
And without water,
the core overheats,

18:57.217 --> 18:58.718
the fuel melts down.

18:58.801 --> 19:01.217
In short, a nuclear disaster.

19:01.301 --> 19:02.967
The solution?

19:03.051 --> 19:06.967
Three diesel fuel
backup generators here.

19:07.051 --> 19:09.301
So, problem solved?

19:09.384 --> 19:11.009
No.

19:11.092 --> 19:13.635
Bryukhanov knew that the problem
was not solved at all.

19:13.718 --> 19:17.134
The backup generators took
approximately one minute

19:17.217 --> 19:19.509
to reach the speed required

19:19.593 --> 19:21.635
to power the pumps
and prevent a meltdown,

19:21.718 --> 19:26.259
and by that time,
it would be too late.

19:26.343 --> 19:28.718
So we arrive
at the safety test.

19:30.426 --> 19:34.051
The theory was this:
If the facility lost power,

19:34.134 --> 19:35.967
the turbine,
which had been spinning,

19:36.051 --> 19:38.760
would take some time
to slow down and stop.

19:38.843 --> 19:41.217
What if you could take
the electricity

19:41.301 --> 19:44.509
it was still generating
and transfer it to the pumps?

19:44.593 --> 19:46.176
What if the dying turbine

19:46.259 --> 19:48.384
could keep the pumps
working long enough

19:48.468 --> 19:52.926
to bridge the 60-second gap
until the generators came on?

19:53.843 --> 19:57.718
(coughing)

19:57.801 --> 19:59.259
Any questions?

20:00.718 --> 20:04.134
Kadnikov:
No. Continue, please.

20:05.760 --> 20:07.967
To test this theory,

20:08.051 --> 20:11.009
the reactor is placed
in a reduced power mode--

20:11.092 --> 20:12.676
700 megawatts--

20:12.760 --> 20:15.343
to simulate
a blackout condition.

20:15.426 --> 20:17.343
Then the turbines
are turned off,

20:17.426 --> 20:19.426
and as they slowly spin down,

20:19.509 --> 20:21.301
their electrical output is
measured

20:21.384 --> 20:25.051
to see if it's enough
to power the pumps.

20:25.134 --> 20:27.384
The science is strong,

20:27.468 --> 20:32.509
but a test is only as good
as the men carrying it out.

20:33.801 --> 20:37.217
Now, the first time they tried,
they failed.

20:37.301 --> 20:40.051
The second time they tried,
they failed.

20:40.134 --> 20:42.801
The third time they tried,
they failed.

20:42.885 --> 20:45.885
The fourth time they tried

20:45.967 --> 20:50.134
was April 26th, 1986.

21:01.843 --> 21:03.843
Stepashin:
Comrade Khomyuk.

21:25.426 --> 21:27.426
(breathes deeply)

21:27.509 --> 21:29.259
To understand
what happened that night,

21:29.343 --> 21:31.343
we have to go back
ten hours earlier--

21:31.426 --> 21:34.926
April 25th, the day the test
was meant to take place.

21:35.009 --> 21:36.259
By two in the afternoon,

21:36.343 --> 21:38.384
the reactor has been
lowered by half

21:38.468 --> 21:41.635
from its normal output level
of 3200 megawatts

21:41.718 --> 21:43.926
to 1600 megawatts
and is stable

21:44.009 --> 21:47.134
and ready to be reduced to its
final output level for the test:

21:47.217 --> 21:49.134
700 megawatts.

21:49.217 --> 21:53.176
But before they can proceed,
there is a phone call.

21:54.217 --> 21:57.217
Power grid officials in Kiev
say that they cannot afford

21:57.301 --> 22:00.676
a further reduction
in the electricity
until after midnight.

22:00.760 --> 22:03.384
They are asking
for a ten-hour delay.

22:04.426 --> 22:06.301
This is the first
critical moment,

22:06.384 --> 22:08.843
the first link
in the chain of disaster.

22:08.926 --> 22:13.509
Competent management would have
insisted on canceling the test.

22:13.593 --> 22:16.593
These three men
allowed it to proceed.

22:18.301 --> 22:20.301
Why was this delay
so dangerous?

22:20.384 --> 22:23.051
It created two problems:

22:23.134 --> 22:26.092
One of them is
scientific in nature...

22:27.217 --> 22:29.843
and the other is very human.

22:29.926 --> 22:32.051
This is the one
we will consider first.

22:32.967 --> 22:37.092
At midnight,
there is a shift change.

22:48.760 --> 22:51.343
-(men chattering)
-Hey.

22:52.092 --> 22:54.676
-Khodemchuk--
-Forget it.
Find another fool.

22:54.760 --> 22:57.718
Toptunov, want to buy
a motorcycle?

22:57.801 --> 23:00.176
Brazhnik:
Toptunov?
He's just a little boy.

23:00.259 --> 23:02.176
He's got more hair on his face
than on his balls.

23:02.259 --> 23:04.551
Hair? Is that
what's on his lip?

23:04.635 --> 23:06.635
(men chuckling)

23:06.718 --> 23:08.217
Leonid Fedorovych.

23:08.301 --> 23:10.885
Akimov says to come
to the control room
as soon as you can.

23:10.967 --> 23:12.718
-Is he already here?
-He came in early.

23:12.801 --> 23:14.801
Something about a test.

23:15.967 --> 23:19.967
-You see? Desperate.
-(indistinct chatter)

23:27.760 --> 23:29.468
Toptunov:
Sasha?

23:30.509 --> 23:34.217
Ah. You know the test
they were supposed to run?

23:34.301 --> 23:36.885
The turbine rundown,
they tried it last year.

23:36.967 --> 23:40.384
They couldn't do it
on the day shift,
so they've given it to us.

23:40.468 --> 23:41.509
To us?

23:41.593 --> 23:43.176
-We don't know what--
-Akimov: Shh.

23:44.801 --> 23:46.885
-(whispering):
We don't know what it is.
-It's fine.

23:46.967 --> 23:49.092
We take it down to 700,
hold it there,

23:49.176 --> 23:51.926
the rest is Stolyarchuk
and Kirschenbaum, but...

23:52.009 --> 23:54.259
Dyatlov is gonna be supervising.

23:54.343 --> 23:56.843
I have to do something
I've never done before

23:56.926 --> 23:58.217
with Dyatlov looking
over my shoulder?

23:58.301 --> 24:01.176
Yeah, well, don't worry,
we'll do it together.

24:01.259 --> 24:03.843
I'm looking at
the instructions now.

24:03.926 --> 24:07.468
Are we supposed to do
those or not?

24:15.384 --> 24:17.926
Yes, this is Akimov in 4.

24:18.009 --> 24:21.593
I have the manual
for the rundown test.

24:21.676 --> 24:24.509
You did it last year.

24:24.593 --> 24:26.967
Yes, in the program there's
instructions of what to do,

24:27.051 --> 24:29.509
and then, well, there's
a lot of things crossed out.

24:29.593 --> 24:31.051
What should I--?

24:32.843 --> 24:34.718
Well, what should I--?

24:36.551 --> 24:38.092
Are you sure?

24:38.176 --> 24:40.885
Right. Thank you.

24:42.259 --> 24:45.051
He says to follow
the crossed-out instructions.

24:45.134 --> 24:47.343
So then why are
they crossed out?

24:47.426 --> 24:49.009
(door opens)

24:53.926 --> 24:56.468
We've been cleared
to run the test.

24:56.551 --> 24:58.301
1600. Good.

24:58.384 --> 25:01.551
Now, is it too much to ask that
you all know what you're doing?

25:01.635 --> 25:03.676
-Well--
-Yes. Absolutely.

25:05.051 --> 25:06.468
-Stolyarchuk?
-Yes.

25:06.551 --> 25:09.593
-Kirschenbaum?
-Uh, I haven't reviewed.

25:09.676 --> 25:11.551
We only just
found out really--

25:11.635 --> 25:12.926
There, review it.

25:13.009 --> 25:14.843
Or you can just
do what I tell you.

25:14.926 --> 25:17.967
I think even you,
stupid as you are,
can manage that.

25:18.885 --> 25:20.551
Well, let's go.

25:23.593 --> 25:26.051
I'm supposed to switch
the turbine off while
the reactor's still running?

25:26.134 --> 25:30.426
-This is not good--
-Shut the fuck up
and do your job!

25:31.259 --> 25:34.301
Toptunov, reduce power to 700.

25:36.384 --> 25:38.551
(whispering):
I've never done this with
the power so low before.

25:38.635 --> 25:40.885
(whispers):
It's okay. I'm with you.

25:45.926 --> 25:47.718
Reducing power to 700.

25:48.926 --> 25:51.468
Khomyuk:
I want you to think
of Yuri Gagarin.

25:53.384 --> 25:55.885
I want you to imagine that
he has been told nothing

25:55.967 --> 25:59.718
of his mission into space
until the moment that
he is on the launch pad.

25:59.801 --> 26:01.885
I want you to imagine
that all he has

26:01.967 --> 26:04.676
is a list of instructions
that he has never seen before,

26:04.760 --> 26:07.217
some of which
have been crossed out.

26:07.301 --> 26:09.217
This is exactly
what was happening

26:09.301 --> 26:10.926
in the control room
of Reactor 4.

26:11.009 --> 26:14.384
The night shift had not
been trained to perform
the experiment.

26:14.468 --> 26:17.217
They hadn't even been
warned it was happening.

26:17.301 --> 26:19.092
Leonid Toptunov,

26:19.176 --> 26:22.718
the operator responsible
for controlling and stabilizing

26:22.801 --> 26:27.967
the reactor that night was...
all of 25 years old.

26:29.217 --> 26:32.343
And his total experience
on the job?

26:32.426 --> 26:34.134
Four months.

26:35.217 --> 26:38.176
This is the human problem
created by the delay.

26:39.092 --> 26:41.885
But inside the reactor core,

26:41.967 --> 26:44.092
in the space between
the atoms themselves,

26:44.176 --> 26:47.426
something far more
dangerous is forming.

26:47.509 --> 26:48.967
A poison.

26:50.635 --> 26:52.843
The time is 28 past midnight.

27:11.009 --> 27:13.343
Comrade Legasov.

27:22.301 --> 27:25.176
(breathes deeply)

27:33.217 --> 27:35.718
(pushcart rolling)

27:50.384 --> 27:52.801
I'm pleased to see some
of my colleagues here

27:52.885 --> 27:56.635
from the Kurchatov Institute
and Minenergo.

27:56.718 --> 27:59.092
But you don't need
to be a nuclear scientist

27:59.176 --> 28:02.217
to understand what
happened at Chernobyl.

28:02.301 --> 28:04.301
You only need to know this:

28:04.384 --> 28:06.967
there are essentially
two things that happen

28:07.051 --> 28:09.676
inside a nuclear reactor.

28:09.760 --> 28:12.301
The reactivity
which generates power

28:12.384 --> 28:16.259
either goes up,
or it goes down.

28:16.343 --> 28:17.760
That's it.

28:17.843 --> 28:22.092
All the operators do
is maintain balance.

28:24.009 --> 28:25.885
Uranium fuel.

28:27.718 --> 28:30.760
As uranium atoms
split apart and collide,

28:30.843 --> 28:32.384
reactivity goes up.

28:32.468 --> 28:34.676
But if you don't
balance the reactivity,

28:34.760 --> 28:36.967
it never stops rising. So...

28:38.885 --> 28:41.217
Boron control rods.

28:41.301 --> 28:45.926
They reduce reactivity
like brakes on a car.

28:47.468 --> 28:51.468
But there's a third factor
to consider: water.

28:52.843 --> 28:55.343
Cool water takes heat
out of the system.

28:55.426 --> 28:58.760
As it does, it turns to steam,
or what we call a "void."

28:58.843 --> 29:02.259
In an RBMK reactor of
the type used at Chernobyl,

29:02.343 --> 29:06.384
there's something called
a "positive void coefficient."

29:06.468 --> 29:08.217
What does that mean?

29:08.301 --> 29:12.760
It means that the more steam
present within the system,

29:12.843 --> 29:14.843
the higher the reactivity,

29:14.926 --> 29:17.967
which means more heat,
which means more steam,

29:18.051 --> 29:19.593
which means...

29:19.676 --> 29:23.593
It would appear we have
a vicious cycle on our hands.

29:23.676 --> 29:26.551
And we would,
were it not for this--

29:26.635 --> 29:28.343
(clatters)

29:32.176 --> 29:37.967
And we would,
were it not for this:

29:38.051 --> 29:41.468
the negative temperature
coefficient.

29:41.551 --> 29:47.551
When nuclear fuel gets hotter,
it gets less reactive, so...

29:48.801 --> 29:51.176
fuel increases reactivity.

29:51.259 --> 29:54.217
Control rods and water
reduce it.

29:54.301 --> 29:56.593
Steam increases it,

29:56.676 --> 29:59.967
and the rise in
temperature reduces it.

30:00.051 --> 30:03.676
This is the invisible dance

30:03.760 --> 30:07.593
that powers entire cities
without smoke or flame.

30:07.676 --> 30:10.967
And it is beautiful

30:11.051 --> 30:13.051
when things are normal.

30:14.343 --> 30:17.217
As uranium splits apart
to release energy,

30:17.301 --> 30:20.801
it breaks down
into a new element, xenon.

30:20.885 --> 30:23.760
Xenon reduces reactivity.

30:23.843 --> 30:27.259
This is the poison
Comrade Khomyuk mentioned.

30:27.343 --> 30:29.301
When the core is
running at full power,

30:29.384 --> 30:32.384
it burns the xenon away
before it can cause a problem.

30:32.468 --> 30:34.593
But because of the delay,

30:34.676 --> 30:38.551
Chernobyl Reactor 4 has
been held at half power

30:38.635 --> 30:40.217
for ten hours.

30:40.301 --> 30:43.051
The xenon did not burn away.

30:44.384 --> 30:48.760
It built up, poisoning the core.

30:48.843 --> 30:50.509
We're starting to lose balance.

30:50.593 --> 30:54.676
-(coughing)
-At 28 minutes past midnight,

30:54.760 --> 30:58.176
the reactor is now
primed to slow down.

30:58.259 --> 31:01.760
And yet, in less than an hour,
it will explode.

31:01.843 --> 31:05.635
If you can't understand
how a stalled nuclear reactor

31:05.718 --> 31:08.426
could lead to an explosion,
I don't blame you.

31:08.509 --> 31:10.551
After all, you don't work
in the control room

31:10.635 --> 31:12.384
of a nuclear power plant.

31:12.468 --> 31:17.885
But as it turned out,
the men who did

31:17.967 --> 31:20.176
didn't understand it either.

31:20.259 --> 31:22.426
(computers humming)

31:26.176 --> 31:27.635
Easy now.

31:27.718 --> 31:29.718
Take it down.

31:29.801 --> 31:31.885
Good. Like that.

31:31.967 --> 31:33.426
Dyatlov:
You should have
finished by now.

31:33.509 --> 31:35.551
We're following protocol
for reduction rate.

31:35.635 --> 31:37.259
You're procrastinating.

31:37.343 --> 31:39.885
There are ten other men
in this plant who would've
done it already.

31:39.967 --> 31:42.635
(whispers):
Keep working.
You're doing fine.

31:51.635 --> 31:55.343
Kirschenbaum, come get me
when these old women are ready.

31:55.426 --> 31:56.843
Yes, Comrade Dyatlov.

32:15.967 --> 32:17.718
Okay, very slow now.

32:17.801 --> 32:20.718
Let's ease it down to 700.

32:23.760 --> 32:27.676
-Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow.
-I-I didn't move any rods there.

32:36.718 --> 32:40.384
-What is this?
-I'm not even touching it.

33:05.092 --> 33:07.760
We did everything right.
I think that maybe
the core is poisoned.

33:07.843 --> 33:09.301
Well, if you thought
the core was poisoned,

33:09.384 --> 33:10.551
then you didn't
do everything right,

33:10.635 --> 33:12.009
because you're
choking my reactor!

33:12.092 --> 33:12.967
Get it back up!

33:13.051 --> 33:15.343
Uh, I think
if we turn off LAC,

33:15.426 --> 33:17.259
it may be possible
to get more control.

33:17.343 --> 33:20.176
-Do it. Go.
-Switch off local
automatic control.

33:20.259 --> 33:23.051
Go to global.
Leonid.

33:23.134 --> 33:25.843
LAC disabled.
Global control activated.

33:31.926 --> 33:33.426
What did you do?

33:34.176 --> 33:37.092
-I-I did what you said.
I switched--
-Dyatlov: Look at it!

33:38.176 --> 33:40.551
-Akimov: I don't understand.
-Dyatlov: Fucking amateurs.

33:40.635 --> 33:42.426
You stalled the reactor.

33:42.509 --> 33:44.343
How the fuck did
you get this job?

33:44.426 --> 33:47.051
-Comrade Dyatlov--
-You're gonna tell me you
did everything right again,

33:47.134 --> 33:48.635
you incompetent asshole?

33:48.718 --> 33:52.092
I apologize for this
unsatisfactory result.

33:56.885 --> 34:00.593
-What are you doing?
-We have to shut
all the way down.

34:00.676 --> 34:03.134
-No.
-We could be
in a xenon pit.

34:03.217 --> 34:04.593
We have to shut down
and wait for 24 hours.

34:04.676 --> 34:06.801
No. We're doing the test
tonight. Raise power to 700.

34:06.885 --> 34:08.176
We can't raise
the power from here.

34:08.259 --> 34:09.843
-The rules--
-Don't talk to me
about rules.

34:09.926 --> 34:12.092
-If we fall from 80%--
-No, no. We fell from 50%.

34:12.176 --> 34:14.468
-Akimov: Fifty percent is worse!
-The rules don't say 50!

34:14.551 --> 34:17.718
-There is no rule!
-Comrade Dyatlov,

34:17.801 --> 34:19.843
I apologize, but what you're
saying makes no sense.

34:19.926 --> 34:22.551
-Raise the power.
-No.

34:22.635 --> 34:25.593
I won't do it.
It isn't safe.

34:34.426 --> 34:37.301
Safety first. Always.

34:37.384 --> 34:40.384
I've been saying that
for 25 years.

34:40.468 --> 34:42.509
That's how long I've
done this job, 25 years.

34:42.593 --> 34:44.051
Is that longer
than you, Akimov?

34:44.134 --> 34:45.051
Yes.

34:45.134 --> 34:47.217
-Is it much longer?
-Yes.

34:47.301 --> 34:50.426
And you with your mother's
tit barely out of your mouth?

34:52.551 --> 34:54.718
So if I say it's safe,
it's safe.

34:54.801 --> 34:56.134
And if the two
of you disagree,

34:56.217 --> 34:58.134
then you don't have to work
here and you won't.

34:58.217 --> 35:00.092
But not just here.
You won't work at Kursk

35:00.176 --> 35:02.760
or Ignalina or Leningrad
or Novo-Voronezh.

35:02.843 --> 35:06.217
You won't work
anywhere ever again.
I'll see to it.

35:06.301 --> 35:09.051
I think you know
I will see to it.

35:10.509 --> 35:12.009
Raise the power.

35:15.259 --> 35:17.176
I would like you
to record your command.

35:18.343 --> 35:19.676
Raise the power.

35:30.635 --> 35:32.676
(breathing shakily)

35:35.259 --> 35:36.635
Together, then.

35:40.217 --> 35:41.885
Dyatlov:
I wasn't even there.

35:41.967 --> 35:44.217
-(voices murmuring)
-Legasov: What?

35:46.092 --> 35:48.593
I wasn't in the room
when they raised the power.

35:48.676 --> 35:50.635
If you weren't there,
then where were you?

35:50.718 --> 35:53.718
Comrade Legasov,
you are a witness,
not a prosecutor.

35:53.801 --> 35:56.301
I will ask the questions here.

35:56.384 --> 35:59.551
If you weren't in the room,
then where were you?

36:01.760 --> 36:03.051
The toilet.

36:03.134 --> 36:04.801
(voices murmuring)

36:04.885 --> 36:06.760
Stepashin:
The toilet?

36:07.718 --> 36:09.509
Comrade Khomyuk
interviewed everyone

36:09.593 --> 36:11.051
who was in the control
room that night.

36:11.134 --> 36:13.092
They all told the same story.

36:16.426 --> 36:19.176
"I knew what Dyatlov
ordered was wrong,

36:19.259 --> 36:22.134
but if I didn't do what
he said, I would be fired."

36:22.217 --> 36:24.259
Leonid Toptunov.

36:25.384 --> 36:27.843
One day before he died.

36:27.926 --> 36:29.843
No, Comrade Dyatlov,
you were in the room.

36:29.926 --> 36:31.676
You ordered them
to raise the power.

36:31.760 --> 36:34.301
-This is a fact.
-(Shcherbina coughing)

36:34.384 --> 36:36.551
(coughing continues)

36:43.051 --> 36:44.718
Court is now in recess.

36:44.801 --> 36:46.301
Thirty minutes.

36:46.384 --> 36:48.468
(coughing)

37:29.509 --> 37:32.635
Do you know anything
about this town, Chernobyl?

37:34.092 --> 37:35.635
Not really, no.

37:36.801 --> 37:39.468
It was mostly Jews and Poles.

37:40.801 --> 37:42.593
The Jews were
killed in pogroms,

37:42.676 --> 37:45.176
and Stalin forced
the Poles out.

37:45.259 --> 37:48.760
And then the Nazis came
and killed whoever was left.

37:48.843 --> 37:50.885
But after the war...

37:52.134 --> 37:54.343
people came to live
here anyway.

37:55.384 --> 37:59.092
They knew the ground under
their feet was soaked in blood,

37:59.176 --> 38:00.885
but they didn't care.

38:02.217 --> 38:05.343
Dead Jews, dead Poles.

38:05.426 --> 38:07.009
But not them.

38:10.009 --> 38:13.176
No one ever thinks it's going
to happen to them.

38:14.551 --> 38:16.009
And here we are.

38:25.551 --> 38:27.593
How much time?

38:27.676 --> 38:29.051
Maybe a year.

38:29.134 --> 38:32.468
They call it a...
(coughs)

38:32.551 --> 38:34.760
They call it a "long illness."

38:34.843 --> 38:37.635
It doesn't seem very long to me.

38:37.718 --> 38:40.259
I know you told me,
and I believed you.

38:41.343 --> 38:43.134
But time passed,
and I thought,

38:43.217 --> 38:45.843
it wouldn't happen to me.

38:46.760 --> 38:48.718
I wasted it.

38:48.801 --> 38:51.593
I wasted it all for nothing.

38:53.217 --> 38:54.885
For nothing?

38:55.760 --> 38:58.718
Do you remember that morning
when I first called you,

38:58.801 --> 39:00.593
how unconcerned I was?

39:00.676 --> 39:02.551
I don't believe much that
comes out of the Kremlin,

39:02.635 --> 39:04.593
but when they told me
they were putting me

39:04.676 --> 39:07.843
in charge of the cleanup

39:07.926 --> 39:10.885
and they said it wasn't serious,
I believed them.

39:12.468 --> 39:14.217
You know why?

39:15.259 --> 39:17.509
Because they put
you in charge.

39:17.593 --> 39:19.092
Yeah.

39:22.051 --> 39:25.134
I'm an inconsequential man,
Valera.

39:25.217 --> 39:27.092
That's all I've ever been.

39:28.259 --> 39:31.384
I hoped that one day
I would matter, but I didn't.

39:33.301 --> 39:36.635
I just stood
next to people who did.

39:38.718 --> 39:41.092
There are other
scientists like me.

39:41.176 --> 39:43.676
Any one of them could
have done what I did.

39:43.760 --> 39:45.092
But you...

39:46.009 --> 39:49.926
Everything we asked for,
everything we needed.

39:51.343 --> 39:55.134
Men, material, lunar rovers.

39:57.468 --> 39:59.635
Who else could have
done these things?

40:01.718 --> 40:05.051
They heard me,
but they listened to you.

40:05.134 --> 40:09.092
Of all the ministers
and all the deputies--

40:09.176 --> 40:13.718
entire congregation
of obedient fools--

40:13.801 --> 40:17.843
they mistakenly sent
the one good man.

40:17.926 --> 40:19.926
For god's sake, Boris,

40:20.009 --> 40:23.468
you were the one
who mattered most.

40:46.509 --> 40:48.343
Ah, it's beautiful.

41:02.051 --> 41:04.176
(crowd murmuring)

41:04.926 --> 41:07.009
(sighs)

41:30.009 --> 41:32.217
Stepashin:
Comrade Legasov.

41:44.551 --> 41:47.551
Legasov:
The time is 38 past midnight.

41:47.635 --> 41:49.635
The reactor is nearly shut down.

41:49.718 --> 41:52.343
The operators of Reactor 4
are locked on a path

41:52.426 --> 41:54.384
that leads directly to disaster.

41:54.468 --> 41:56.676
There's no way to turn back.

41:56.760 --> 41:59.426
They do not yet know it,
but the die is cast.

41:59.509 --> 42:03.760
At 30 megawatts,
xenon is still being created,

42:03.843 --> 42:06.092
but none of it is burning away.

42:07.801 --> 42:09.676
The reactor is
drowning in poison.

42:09.760 --> 42:14.176
To make matters worse,
the reactor isn't hot enough

42:14.259 --> 42:17.051
to produce sufficient steam.

42:18.676 --> 42:21.509
The only way to safely raise
power from this state

42:21.593 --> 42:23.885
is to do it very, very slowly

42:23.967 --> 42:26.760
over the course of 24 hours.

42:26.843 --> 42:29.384
But Dyatlov wants it done now.

42:29.468 --> 42:33.843
Akimov and Toptunov have
only one course of action.

42:33.967 --> 42:36.718
They begin pulling
control rods out.

42:36.801 --> 42:37.926
Dozens at a time.

42:38.009 --> 42:41.051
Halfway out,
three-quarters of the way out,

42:41.134 --> 42:43.885
still, the power does not budge.

42:43.967 --> 42:46.676
So they begin pulling
them all the way out.

42:46.760 --> 42:50.551
There were 211 control rods
in Reactor 4.

42:50.635 --> 42:55.259
Akimov and Toptunov
completely withdrew 205.

42:55.343 --> 43:00.009
Remember-- control rods are
the brakes on this car.

43:00.092 --> 43:06.843
Of 211 rods, only six
now remain in the reactor.

43:08.259 --> 43:10.885
As for the fuel,
it's gone cold,

43:10.967 --> 43:13.051
so the negative
temperature coefficient

43:13.134 --> 43:15.593
is no longer weighing
down the reactivity.

43:15.676 --> 43:19.593
But even still, the xenon
poisoning is so strong,

43:19.676 --> 43:23.843
the best they can do is raise
the power to 200 megawatts.

43:23.926 --> 43:26.885
The control rods are out.

43:26.967 --> 43:29.426
The emergency system
has been disconnected.

43:29.509 --> 43:31.760
The only thing keeping
the reactor in check

43:31.843 --> 43:34.301
is water and xenon.

43:34.384 --> 43:38.635
It's one in the morning.
The test is minutes away.

43:44.967 --> 43:46.509
(buttons clicking)

44:05.092 --> 44:07.217
(buttons clicking)

44:12.926 --> 44:15.384
I'm sorry, this is
all we can get.

44:15.468 --> 44:18.426
It's 200 megawatts.
We've pulled almost
everything out.

44:18.509 --> 44:20.009
If that's all we have,
that's all we have.

44:20.092 --> 44:23.967
-But the test requires 700.
-Stolyarchuk, let's get ready.

44:24.051 --> 44:25.635
-Switch on pump 4.
-Akimov: No, wait a second.

44:25.718 --> 44:27.509
-Dyatlov: Stolyarchuk--
-We have barely enough
steam as it is.

44:27.593 --> 44:30.134
The turbine is going
too slow for the test
to deliver any valid results.

44:30.217 --> 44:32.092
-It's enough.
-And if we add more water,
there will be even less--

44:32.176 --> 44:34.134
I said it's enough.
I know what I'm doing.

44:34.217 --> 44:35.676
Stolyarchuk.

44:41.217 --> 44:42.760
Main Pump 4,
connected.

44:42.843 --> 44:44.635
We should warn Khodemchuk.
The pipes are gonna be--

44:44.718 --> 44:46.426
Never mind him.
Kirschenbaum?

44:47.134 --> 44:49.343
(alarm sounding)

44:49.426 --> 44:52.176
The steam in the separator drum
is too low-- five atmospheres.

44:52.259 --> 44:55.092
All right, let's all help him.
Get it up as best you can.

44:55.176 --> 44:57.551
(alarm continuing)

44:59.134 --> 45:01.009
We should stop.

45:01.092 --> 45:02.760
Dyatlov:
Turn that fucking
thing off.

45:02.843 --> 45:05.760
-(alarm stops)
-You have 15 minutes.

45:07.593 --> 45:09.718
Legasov:
Fifteen minutes.

45:09.801 --> 45:12.468
They may as well
have had 15 days.

45:12.551 --> 45:15.384
The problem they were facing
was not solvable.

45:15.468 --> 45:18.176
The power was too low,
the water was too high.

45:18.259 --> 45:19.843
The test was already ruined.

45:19.926 --> 45:21.551
The results would
have been useless,

45:21.635 --> 45:23.134
but Dyatlov didn't care.

45:23.217 --> 45:26.593
All he wanted to do was
report a completed test.

45:27.509 --> 45:29.551
1:22 a.m.

45:29.635 --> 45:32.593
Less than two minutes remain.

45:32.676 --> 45:38.176
Yuvchenko, a mechanical
engineer, is in his office.

45:41.509 --> 45:43.885
Perevozchenko,
reactor section foreman,

45:43.967 --> 45:45.593
is in the refueling hall,

45:45.676 --> 45:50.301
high above the 1,000-ton
steel reactor cover.

45:50.384 --> 45:53.676
-(rumbling)
- Degtaryenko and Khodemchuk,

45:53.760 --> 45:56.843
circulation operators,
are in the pump room.

45:58.967 --> 46:00.718
None of them have been told

46:00.801 --> 46:02.092
about the test.

46:02.176 --> 46:04.134
None of them know
what is about to happen.

46:04.217 --> 46:08.509
At 1:22 and 30 seconds,

46:08.593 --> 46:10.635
Toptunov sees a report

46:10.718 --> 46:14.676
from the reactor's
SKALA computer system.

46:14.760 --> 46:18.051
Based on the absence
of sufficient control rods,

46:18.134 --> 46:21.676
the computer is recommending
that the reactor be shut down.

46:26.885 --> 46:28.551
Well, of course
it's saying that.

46:28.635 --> 46:30.635
It doesn't know
we're running a test.

46:32.009 --> 46:33.301
All right, comrades.

46:34.843 --> 46:37.426
Another few minutes,
it will all be over.

46:37.509 --> 46:39.051
Kirschenbaum, when you're ready.

46:40.217 --> 46:41.635
We did everything right.

46:43.801 --> 46:46.176
Kirschenbaum:
Oscillograph on.

46:47.426 --> 46:49.967
Closing Number 8
throttle valve.

46:50.051 --> 46:51.676
Stolyarchuk:
Generator rotor
beginning rundown.

46:51.760 --> 46:55.635
Legasov:
1:23 and four seconds.

46:55.718 --> 46:57.051
With every decision,

46:57.134 --> 46:59.551
they have pulled this reactor
back like a slingshot,

46:59.635 --> 47:01.885
further than anyone
has ever pulled,

47:01.967 --> 47:04.301
now the test begins.

47:04.384 --> 47:08.051
The pumps are shut down,
and they've let go.

47:10.509 --> 47:13.760
The pumps stop moving water
through the reactor.

47:13.843 --> 47:17.009
Uranium fuel is now
unchecked by fresh coolant,

47:17.092 --> 47:18.926
unchecked by control rods.

47:19.009 --> 47:22.134
The balance immediately swings
in the opposite direction.

47:22.217 --> 47:23.635
In less than a second,

47:23.718 --> 47:25.551
reactivity increases.

47:26.760 --> 47:28.009
Inside the core,

47:28.092 --> 47:30.551
the remaining water is
quickly converting to steam.

47:30.635 --> 47:32.718
A void is being created.

47:32.801 --> 47:35.426
There is no fresh water
to replace it.

47:35.509 --> 47:38.426
Steam increases reactivity,

47:38.509 --> 47:41.843
increases heat, increases steam,

47:41.926 --> 47:44.676
increases reactivity.

47:44.760 --> 47:48.051
The remaining xenon decays away.

47:49.384 --> 47:51.468
The power is rising.

47:53.051 --> 47:54.885
There's nothing left to stop it.

47:54.967 --> 47:59.551
1:23 and 35 seconds.

48:02.760 --> 48:05.092
We have a power surge! Sasha!

48:10.343 --> 48:11.468
What did you do?!

48:11.551 --> 48:16.301
1:23 and 40 seconds.

48:23.301 --> 48:25.843
In every control room of every
nuclear reactor in the world,

48:25.926 --> 48:29.092
there is a button
with one single purpose--

48:29.176 --> 48:32.551
to "scram," or instantly
shut down, the reaction.

48:32.635 --> 48:36.176
In Soviet reactors,
that button is called AZ-5.

48:36.259 --> 48:41.217
You press AZ-5,
all of the control rods
insert at once,

48:41.301 --> 48:45.384
and the reaction
is stopped dead.

48:45.468 --> 48:47.301
But...

48:48.843 --> 48:50.801
(sighs)

48:53.176 --> 48:56.843
-What are you waiting for,
Legasov? Tell your lies.
-(gavel pounding)

48:56.926 --> 48:59.217
Kadnikov:
Comrade Dyatlov, you will
not be warned again.

48:59.301 --> 49:01.551
-Dyatlov: Or what?
-For god's sake, Dyatlov.

49:01.635 --> 49:03.509
Legasov's already
given it away.

49:03.593 --> 49:06.635
-He said before, there was no
way to avoid what was coming.
-Comrade Dyatlov.

49:06.718 --> 49:09.718
-He knows something.
She knows something.
-Comrade Dyatlov.

49:09.801 --> 49:13.426
-(gavel pounding)
-Dyatlov: I know what you are,
Valery Alexeyevich.

49:13.509 --> 49:16.468
-You're a liar.
-We've heard enough for today.

49:16.551 --> 49:20.426
-(murmuring)
-The defendants will be
remanded in custody.

49:20.509 --> 49:23.509
-Court will--
-I... I haven't finished.

49:23.593 --> 49:25.635
I still have more
evidence to give.

49:25.718 --> 49:29.092
It's not necessary.
Your testimony is concluded.

49:29.176 --> 49:32.301
-Your Honor.
-Court is now adjourned.

49:32.384 --> 49:34.718
-We will resume tomorrow with--
-Shcherbina: Let him finish.

49:34.801 --> 49:36.176
(chair clatters)

49:37.384 --> 49:39.384
Kadnikov:
Comrade Shcherbina...

49:41.551 --> 49:43.885
Let him finish.

50:07.760 --> 50:10.176
Dyatlov broke
every rule we have.

50:10.259 --> 50:12.343
(sighs)

50:14.009 --> 50:17.426
He pushed a reactor
to the brink of destruction.

50:21.593 --> 50:24.217
He did these things believing
there was a failsafe.

50:24.301 --> 50:27.551
AZ-5, a simple button
to shut it all down.

50:27.635 --> 50:32.217
But in the circumstances
he created, there wasn't.

50:32.301 --> 50:35.760
The shutdown system
had a fatal flaw.

50:37.760 --> 50:43.259
At 1:23:40, Akimov engages AZ-5.

50:45.635 --> 50:48.259
(alarm buzzes)

50:50.718 --> 50:52.468
The fully-withdrawn
control rods

50:52.551 --> 50:54.676
begin moving back
into the reactor.

50:54.760 --> 50:57.635
These rods are made of boron,
which reduces reactivity,

50:57.718 --> 50:59.384
but not their tips.

50:59.468 --> 51:04.426
The tips are made of graphite,
which accelerates reactivity.

51:04.509 --> 51:06.301
Kadnikov:
Why?

51:10.176 --> 51:12.134
Legasov:
Why?

51:13.509 --> 51:16.009
For the same reason
our reactors

51:16.092 --> 51:19.176
do not have containment
buildings around them,

51:19.259 --> 51:20.301
like those in the West.

51:20.384 --> 51:22.718
For the same reason
we don't use

51:22.801 --> 51:25.343
properly enriched fuel
in our cores.

51:25.426 --> 51:27.718
For the same reason
we are the only nation

51:27.801 --> 51:32.092
that builds water-cooled,
graphite-moderated reactors

51:32.176 --> 51:35.301
with a positive
void coefficient.

51:36.676 --> 51:37.760
It's cheaper.

51:37.843 --> 51:41.343
(crowd murmuring)

51:44.134 --> 51:46.967
(clears throat)
The first part of the rods
that enter the core

51:47.051 --> 51:48.301
are the graphite tips.

51:48.384 --> 51:50.760
And when they do,
the reaction in the core,

51:50.843 --> 51:53.509
which had been rising,
skyrockets.

51:53.593 --> 51:57.009
Every last molecule
of liquid water

51:57.092 --> 51:58.718
instantly converts to steam,

51:58.801 --> 52:02.092
which expands and ruptures
a series of fuel rod channels.

52:02.176 --> 52:06.301
The control rods in those
channels can move no further.

52:06.384 --> 52:08.926
The graphite tips are
fixed in position,

52:09.009 --> 52:11.801
endlessly accelerating
the reaction.

52:11.885 --> 52:15.885
Chernobyl Reactor 4
is now a nuclear bomb.

52:15.967 --> 52:18.509
1:23:42.

52:18.593 --> 52:20.343
Perevozchenko looks down

52:20.426 --> 52:22.967
- on the enormous steel lid
of the reactor...
-(loud rumbling)

52:23.051 --> 52:24.967
...and sees the impossible.

52:25.051 --> 52:26.926
The control rod
and fuel channel caps,

52:27.009 --> 52:29.092
which each weigh 350 kilograms,

52:29.176 --> 52:30.760
are jumping up and down.

52:30.843 --> 52:33.426
He runs to warn
the control room.

52:33.509 --> 52:36.967
But there's nothing he can do
to stop what is coming.

52:37.051 --> 52:39.468
1:23 and 44 seconds.

52:39.551 --> 52:43.635
-(alarms buzzing)
- The steam blows more
fuel channels apart.

52:43.718 --> 52:45.801
We do not know
how high the power went.

52:45.885 --> 52:48.176
We only know the final reading.

52:49.760 --> 52:50.801
Reactor 4,

52:50.885 --> 52:54.967
designed to operate
at 3200 megawatts,

52:55.051 --> 52:58.718
went beyond 33,000.

53:03.217 --> 53:07.009
The pressure inside the core
can no longer be held back.

53:07.092 --> 53:14.801
At long last, we have arrived.
1:23:45, explosion.

53:14.885 --> 53:19.051
In the instant the lid
is thrown off the reactor,
oxygen rushes in.

53:19.134 --> 53:23.593
It combines with hydrogen
and super-heated graphite.

53:25.343 --> 53:28.426
The chain of disaster
is now complete.

53:50.384 --> 53:52.509
Akimov (muffled):
Comrade Dyatlov!

53:57.301 --> 53:59.134
Comrade Dyatlov!

54:01.468 --> 54:06.801
(no audible dialogue)

54:09.801 --> 54:12.718
Legasov:
No one in the room
that night knew

54:12.801 --> 54:16.259
the shutdown button
could act as a detonator.

54:17.801 --> 54:19.551
They didn't know it,

54:19.635 --> 54:22.551
because it was kept from them.

54:22.635 --> 54:25.092
Kadnikov:
Comrade Legasov,
you're contradicting

54:25.176 --> 54:27.509
your own testimony in Vienna.

54:27.593 --> 54:30.301
My testimony in Vienna
was a lie.

54:30.384 --> 54:34.384
-(crowd murmuring)
-I lied to the world.

54:34.468 --> 54:36.801
I'm not the only one
who kept this secret.

54:36.885 --> 54:39.092
There are many.

54:39.176 --> 54:41.885
We were following orders,

54:41.967 --> 54:43.551
from the KGB,
from the Central Committee.

54:43.635 --> 54:46.301
And right now, there are 16
reactors in the Soviet Union

54:46.384 --> 54:48.843
with the same fatal flaw.

54:48.926 --> 54:50.760
Three of them are still running

54:50.843 --> 54:53.134
less than 20 kilometers
away at Chernobyl.

54:53.217 --> 54:57.259
Professor Legasov, if you mean
to suggest the Soviet State

54:57.343 --> 54:59.092
is somehow responsible
for what happened,

54:59.176 --> 55:01.926
then I must warn you, you are
treading on dangerous ground.

55:02.009 --> 55:04.343
I've already trod
on dangerous ground.

55:04.426 --> 55:06.468
We're on dangerous
ground right now,

55:06.551 --> 55:09.301
because of our secrets
and our lies.

55:09.384 --> 55:12.468
They're practically
what define us.

55:12.551 --> 55:15.676
When the truth offends,
we lie and lie

55:15.760 --> 55:18.134
until we can no longer
remember it is even there.

55:18.217 --> 55:21.217
But it is still there.

55:23.384 --> 55:27.718
Every lie we tell incurs
a debt to the truth.

55:29.843 --> 55:32.718
Sooner or later,
that debt is paid.

55:36.885 --> 55:42.426
That is how an RBMK
reactor core explodes.

55:46.092 --> 55:47.635
Lies.

57:51.593 --> 57:54.635
Valery Alexeyevich Legasov,

57:54.718 --> 57:57.760
son of Alexei Legasov,

57:57.843 --> 58:01.301
Head of Ideological Compliance,
Central Committee.

58:01.384 --> 58:03.384
Do you know what
your father did there?

58:03.468 --> 58:04.926
Yes.

58:05.009 --> 58:08.967
As a student, you had a
leadership position in Komsomol.

58:09.051 --> 58:11.384
Communist Youth, correct?

58:12.384 --> 58:14.801
-You already know.
-Answer the question.

58:14.885 --> 58:16.051
Yes.

58:17.843 --> 58:19.967
At the Kuchartov Institute,

58:20.051 --> 58:22.676
you were the Communist
Party secretary.

58:22.760 --> 58:24.176
In the position,
you limited

58:24.259 --> 58:27.176
the promotion
of Jewish scientists.

58:31.635 --> 58:33.009
Yes.

58:33.092 --> 58:36.760
To curry favor
with Kremlin officials.

58:41.426 --> 58:43.718
You're one of us, Legasov.

58:45.134 --> 58:47.551
I can do anything
I want with you.

58:48.760 --> 58:52.843
But what I want most is
for you to know that I know.

58:52.926 --> 58:55.301
You're not brave.

58:55.384 --> 58:57.593
You're not heroic.

58:59.092 --> 59:02.343
You're just a dying man
who forgot himself.

59:02.426 --> 59:06.134
I know who I am,
and I know what I've done.

59:08.718 --> 59:11.092
In a just world,
I'd be shot for my lies,

59:11.176 --> 59:14.343
but not for this,
not for the truth.

59:14.426 --> 59:16.551
Scientists...

59:16.635 --> 59:20.384
and your idiot obsessions
with reasons.

59:20.468 --> 59:22.718
When the bullet
hits your skull,

59:22.801 --> 59:25.343
what will it matter why?

59:32.593 --> 59:35.134
No one's getting shot,
Legasov.

59:36.635 --> 59:38.967
The whole world
saw you in Vienna.

59:39.051 --> 59:41.217
It would be embarrassing
to kill you now.

59:41.301 --> 59:42.760
And for what?

59:42.843 --> 59:46.635
Your testimony today
will not be accepted
by the State.

59:46.718 --> 59:49.760
It will not be
disseminated in the press.

59:49.843 --> 59:51.801
It never happened.

59:53.092 --> 59:56.051
No, you will live,

59:56.134 --> 59:57.926
however long you have,

59:58.009 --> 1:00:01.718
but not as a scientist,
not anymore.

1:00:01.801 --> 1:00:06.343
You'll keep your title
and your office,

1:00:06.426 --> 1:00:11.343
but no duties,
no authority,
no friends.

1:00:11.426 --> 1:00:13.509
No one will
talk to you.

1:00:13.593 --> 1:00:15.509
No one will
listen to you.

1:00:17.468 --> 1:00:21.760
Other men,
lesser men,

1:00:21.843 --> 1:00:25.509
will receive credit for
the things you have done.

1:00:25.593 --> 1:00:27.885
Your legacy is
now their legacy.

1:00:27.967 --> 1:00:30.718
You'll live long enough
to see that.

1:00:34.134 --> 1:00:36.551
What role did
Shcherbina play in this?

1:00:36.635 --> 1:00:37.760
None.

1:00:37.843 --> 1:00:40.384
He didn't know
what I was gonna say.

1:00:41.676 --> 1:00:44.760
What role did
Khomyuk play in this?

1:00:44.843 --> 1:00:46.301
None.

1:00:46.384 --> 1:00:48.885
She didn't know either.

1:00:50.259 --> 1:00:52.635
After all you've said
and done today,

1:00:52.718 --> 1:00:58.676
it would be curious
if you chose this moment to lie.

1:01:01.593 --> 1:01:03.468
I would think a man
of your experience

1:01:03.551 --> 1:01:05.885
would know a lie
when he hears one.

1:01:10.051 --> 1:01:11.343
You will not meet
or communicate

1:01:11.426 --> 1:01:13.593
with either one
of them ever again.

1:01:13.676 --> 1:01:16.176
You will not communicate
with anyone

1:01:16.259 --> 1:01:18.384
about Chernobyl ever again.

1:01:19.426 --> 1:01:21.843
You will remain so immaterial
to the world around you

1:01:21.926 --> 1:01:23.718
that when you
finally do die,

1:01:23.801 --> 1:01:28.092
it will be exceedingly hard
to know that you ever lived
at all.

1:01:32.426 --> 1:01:34.259
What if I refuse?

1:01:37.426 --> 1:01:40.509
Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?

1:01:40.593 --> 1:01:41.843
(scoffs)

1:01:41.926 --> 1:01:45.926
"Why worry about something
that isn't going to happen?"

1:01:46.009 --> 1:01:48.259
Oh, that's perfect.

1:01:48.343 --> 1:01:51.426
They should put that
on our money.

1:02:20.426 --> 1:02:22.468
(car engine starting)

1:03:00.509 --> 1:03:04.593
Legasov (on tape):
To be a scientist
is to be naive.

1:03:04.676 --> 1:03:06.926
We are so focused on
our search for truth,

1:03:07.009 --> 1:03:11.635
we fail to consider how few
actually want us to find it.

1:03:11.718 --> 1:03:16.092
But it is always there,
whether we see it or not,

1:03:16.176 --> 1:03:18.009
whether we choose to or not.

1:03:18.092 --> 1:03:20.843
The truth doesn't care
about our needs or wants.

1:03:20.926 --> 1:03:22.635
It doesn't care
about our governments,

1:03:22.718 --> 1:03:26.426
our ideologies,
our religions.

1:03:26.509 --> 1:03:30.134
It will lie in wait
for all time.

1:03:30.217 --> 1:03:34.134
And this, at last,
is the gift of Chernobyl.

1:03:34.217 --> 1:03:36.843
Where I once would fear
the cost of truth,

1:03:36.926 --> 1:03:39.718
now I only ask:

1:03:40.718 --> 1:03:43.551
What is the cost of lies?

1:03:49.760 --> 1:03:52.217
(no audible dialogue)
