MRS. PINCIOTTI, CAN YOU
PLEASE TELL DONNA I'M RIGHT?

13:54.083 --> 13:55.834
ISN'T IT COOL WHEN MEN
ACT LIKE THEY OWN YOU?

13:56.001 --> 13:58.837
OH, YEAH.

13:59.004 --> 14:01.381
MOM, WHAT ABOUT ALL THOSE
FEMINIST CLASSES YOU TOOK?

14:01.549 --> 14:02.799
OH, RIGHT.

14:02.967 --> 14:05.635
NO!

14:09.598 --> 14:10.932
HEY, MR. PINCIOTTI.
HEY, DAD.

14:11.100 --> 14:12.183
HEY, THERE, ERIC.

14:12.351 --> 14:13.518
HEY, DAD, UH...

14:13.686 --> 14:14.936
I WAS WONDERING IF
YOU'D SHOW ME, LIKE,

14:15.104 --> 14:17.856
A FEW FIGHTING MOVES.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.148
WHO YOU PLANNING
TO FIGHT?

14:19.316 --> 14:20.984
DAVID MILBANK.

14:21.151 --> 14:26.656
DAVID MILBANK?
HE'S GOT SCOLIOSIS AND ASTHMA.

14:26.824 --> 14:29.117
YOU COULD TAKE HIM.

14:29.285 --> 14:30.368
COME ON NOW, ERIC.

14:30.536 --> 14:31.744
WHY DON'T YOU, UH...

14:31.912 --> 14:35.123
BEAT UP KELSO?
I DON'T WORK FOR HIS DAD.

14:35.291 --> 14:36.708
HE'S MAKING A MOVE ON DONNA.

14:36.876 --> 14:39.085
OH, NO, NO, NO.

14:39.253 --> 14:44.549
DONNA'S NOT GOING NEAR
THAT PRETZEL BOY.

14:44.717 --> 14:47.927
NO, NO, YOU GOTTA
NIP THIS IN THE BUD, ERIC.

14:48.095 --> 14:50.263
ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT.

14:50.431 --> 14:52.932
THE BRIDGE OF THE NOSE
IS VERY VULNERABLE.

14:53.100 --> 14:56.269
OH, OH, AND HIT HIM
WITH A BANJO.

15:02.735 --> 15:04.402
A BANJO, BOB?

15:04.570 --> 15:06.779
WHAT?
I'M HELPING.

15:06.947 --> 15:09.115
WHERE IS HE GONNA
GET A BANJO?

15:09.283 --> 15:10.700
I DON'T KNOW.

15:10.868 --> 15:13.077
BUT I SAW A GUY
GET HIT WITH A BANJO ONCE.

15:13.245 --> 15:16.998
AND HE WENT DOWN.

15:21.170 --> 15:25.715
HITTING A GUY
WITH A BANJO IS DIRTY.

15:25.883 --> 15:29.218
YOU WANT TO KNEE HIM
IN THE GROIN.

15:29.386 --> 15:33.723
YOU CAN HIT HIM IN
THE GROIN WITH A BANJO.

15:36.101 --> 15:37.852
SO WHAT DO YOU WANT
TO DO TONIGHT?

15:38.020 --> 15:42.065
OH, AND I YOU SAY SEE
STAR WARS AGAIN, I'M LEAVING.

15:44.234 --> 15:47.946
YOU DON'T WANT TO LEAVE.

15:48.781 --> 15:51.282
YOU WANT TO SEE STAR WARS.

15:51.450 --> 15:53.534
STOP IT!
I HAVE HAD IT WITH YOU.

15:53.702 --> 15:56.287
YOU ARE WEIRD,
AND I'M GOING HOME.

15:57.247 --> 15:59.248
JACKIE.

16:02.169 --> 16:03.503
OH, BOY.

16:03.671 --> 16:05.296
THAT'S TERRIBLE
THE WAY SHE TREATS YOU.

16:05.464 --> 16:08.383
RIGHT?

16:08.550 --> 16:11.970
YOU KNOW, I SAW STAR WARS,
AND I'M NOT A MOVIE EXPERT,

16:12.137 --> 16:13.304
BUT I THINK IT'S SAFE TO SAY,

16:13.472 --> 16:15.932
IT WAS THE GREATEST FILM
OF ALL TIME.

16:16.100 --> 16:17.892
FINALLY!

16:18.060 --> 16:20.687
SOMEONE WHO UNDERSTANDS.

16:20.854 --> 16:22.814
YEAH.

16:23.774 --> 16:25.149
YOU KNOW, KELSO,
I ALWAYS THOUGHT

16:25.317 --> 16:27.902
YOU WERE KIND OF DUMB.

16:29.321 --> 16:32.073
UH-HUH.

16:32.241 --> 16:34.575
BUT I DON'T CARE.

16:38.122 --> 16:40.248
YOU KNOW,
I DON'T EITHER.

16:40.416 --> 16:42.667
IT'S...

16:46.964 --> 16:49.132
WHERE'S ERIC?

16:49.299 --> 16:54.137
UM, I DON'T KNOW.

17:01.854 --> 17:04.147
I THINK YOU DO KNOW, RED.

17:05.190 --> 17:06.482
ALL RIGHT, KITTY.

17:06.650 --> 17:07.608
SOME KID'S BEEN
HITTING ON DONNA,

17:07.776 --> 17:09.527
SO HE WENT TO FIGHT HIM,
BUT IT'S NO BIG DEAL.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.653
NO BIG DEAL?

17:10.821 --> 17:13.531
YOU MEN ARE
SUCH NEANDERTHALS.

17:13.699 --> 17:16.367
FIGHTING OVER A WOMAN.
IT'S RIDICULOUS.

17:16.535 --> 17:17.827
IT'S LIKE THAT TIME
AT THAT BEACH

17:17.995 --> 17:19.871
WHEN THAT LIFEGUARD
PINCHED MY FANNY.

17:20.039 --> 17:23.583
YOU JUST HAD TO LAY HIM OUT,
DIDN'T YOU?

17:23.751 --> 17:26.044
WELL, YEAH!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.881
WELL, HOW DO YOU THINK
I FELT, RED?

17:30.049 --> 17:31.883
WATCHING YOU STAND OVER
THAT POOR MAN,

17:32.051 --> 17:35.136
YOUR... YOUR EYES
BURNING WITH INTENSITY,

17:35.304 --> 17:38.514
YOUR... YOUR SUNTANNED
MUSCLES GLEAMING

17:38.682 --> 17:41.267
LIKE A... LIKE A BRONZE GOD.

18:01.371 --> 18:04.082
OKAY, YOU AND ME,
RIGHT NOW!

18:04.249 --> 18:05.500
ERIC, WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

18:05.667 --> 18:06.667
THIS ISN'T ABOUT YOU, DONNA.

18:06.835 --> 18:07.877
ERIC, STOP IT!

18:08.045 --> 18:08.920
YEAH, GO AHEAD,
HOLD ME BACK.

18:09.088 --> 18:12.090
STOP IT!

18:12.257 --> 18:15.093
ERIC, FOR THE LAST TIME,

18:15.260 --> 18:18.721
DAVID HAS NO INTEREST
IN ME WHATSOEVER.

18:19.306 --> 18:21.099
YEAH, I DO.

18:22.601 --> 18:23.267
WHAT?

18:23.435 --> 18:24.727
WELL, WHY DO YOU THINK
WE'VE BEEN SPENDING

18:24.895 --> 18:27.980
SO MUCH TIME TOGETHER?

18:28.607 --> 18:29.816
'CAUSE WE'RE FRIENDS?

18:29.983 --> 18:32.318
OH, COME ON, DONNA!

18:32.486 --> 18:34.612
I MEAN, I'VE TALKED TO YOU,
I'VE LISTENED TO YOU,

18:34.780 --> 18:37.365
I'VE SHARED IDEAS
WITH YOU.

18:37.533 --> 18:39.283
WHAT'S THAT ABOUT?

18:39.451 --> 18:40.993
SHE'S HAVING A LITTLE
PROBLEM WITH...

18:41.161 --> 18:44.372
WHAT?!

18:44.540 --> 18:45.790
I DON'T KNOW WHAT
IT TAKES WITH WOMEN.

18:45.958 --> 18:47.542
I MEAN, YOU PUT IN ALL
THIS TIME AND EFFORT,

18:47.709 --> 18:48.835
AND THEY WANT TO BE...

18:49.002 --> 18:50.211
[TOGETHER]
JUST FRIENDS!

18:50.379 --> 18:52.296
I KNOW.
I HATE THAT.

18:52.464 --> 18:54.465
MAN, AND TO THINK I WAS
GONNA KICK YOUR ASS.

18:54.633 --> 18:56.300
HEY, YOU HAD
EVERY REASON.

18:56.468 --> 18:59.262
DO YOU HEAR THAT, DONNA?
"EVERY REASON."

18:59.429 --> 19:01.013
YOU KNOW WHAT, ERIC?

19:01.181 --> 19:05.351
YOU DON'T TRUST ME,
AND YOU DON'T RESPECT ME.

19:07.688 --> 19:10.523
NO, NO, DONNA,
I WAS JUST TRYING...

19:10.691 --> 19:12.942
(DONNA)
GET AWAY FROM ME!

19:16.822 --> 19:18.656
WELL, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE WORKED OUT

19:18.824 --> 19:20.158
WITH HER AND ME ANYWAY.

19:20.325 --> 19:21.576
I MEAN, I'M NOT SUPPOSED
TO SAY ANYTHING,

19:21.743 --> 19:22.827
BUT WE'RE JUST HERE
UNTIL MY DAD

19:22.995 --> 19:24.954
CLOSES DOWN THE PLANT.

19:26.123 --> 19:27.582
WAIT.
CLOSE?

19:27.749 --> 19:29.834
I... YOUR DAD WAS
OPENING THE PLANT FULL-TIME.

19:30.002 --> 19:31.419
YEAH, WELL, THEY'RE
BURNING OFF THE INVENTORY,

19:31.587 --> 19:33.838
AND THEN THAT'S
ALL SHE WROTE.

19:34.006 --> 19:36.966
MY DAD'S DEPENDING
ON THAT JOB.

19:37.134 --> 19:39.093
YEAH, WELL, I GUESS HE
SHOULD HAVE THOUGHT AHEAD,

19:39.261 --> 19:40.553
LIKE MY DAD.

19:40.721 --> 19:42.680
HEY...

19:50.981 --> 19:54.317
YOU BASTARD!
YOU BROKE MY NOSE!

19:54.484 --> 19:56.527
GOOD!

19:57.905 --> 20:02.658
[HEAVY BREATHING
LIKE DARTH VADER]

20:02.826 --> 20:06.871
[IMITATES DARTH VADER]
YOU'LL PAY FOR THIS,
FORMAN.

20:07.039 --> 20:11.542
BEFORE I LEAVE,
DONNA WILL BE MINE.

20:24.264 --> 20:26.515
HEY, DAD.

20:26.683 --> 20:28.184
HEY, DAD,
CAN I TALK TO YOU?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.269
ABSOLUTELY.

20:30.437 --> 20:34.065
ERIC, I AM VERY, VERY
DISAPPOINTED IN YOU

20:34.233 --> 20:35.858
FOR FIGHTING.

20:36.026 --> 20:38.069
I'M SORRY.

20:38.237 --> 20:40.696
IT'S OKAY.

20:44.576 --> 20:47.286
SEE YOU IN THE CAR.

20:51.667 --> 20:52.959
WHERE YOU GUYS GOING?

20:53.126 --> 20:56.754
OH, TAKING YOUR MOTHER OUT
FOR DINNER AND A MOVIE.

20:56.922 --> 20:59.465
A LITTLE CELEBRATION.

21:00.300 --> 21:02.593
YOU KNOW, SON,
SOMETIMES LIFE GIVES YOU

21:02.761 --> 21:04.428
A GOOD BOUNCE.

21:04.596 --> 21:07.390
SO WHAT DID YOU
WANT TO TALK ABOUT?

21:07.557 --> 21:11.102
UM... HAVE A GOOD TIME.

21:11.979 --> 21:14.272
OH, YEAH.

21:21.280 --> 21:26.117
HEY, LITTLE BROTHER.
I MADE OUT WITH KELSO.

21:26.285 --> 21:28.995
SHUT UP!

21:30.080 --> 21:31.289
WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

21:31.456 --> 21:33.040
EVERYTHING'S WRONG.

21:33.208 --> 21:37.003
DONNA'S MAD AT ME.
AND THE PLANT'S CLOSING.

21:37.170 --> 21:38.587
DAD'S OUT OF A JOB.

21:38.755 --> 21:40.756
OH, WOW.

21:40.924 --> 21:42.466
GUESS THIS IS A BAD TIME
TO TELL HIM

21:42.634 --> 21:46.637
I FLUNKED OUT OF COLLEGE.

21:46.805 --> 21:47.930
YOU KNOW WHAT, LAURIE?

21:48.098 --> 21:50.975
I CANNOT BELIEVE
THAT YOU'RE THE FAVORITE.

21:53.228 --> 21:54.603
YEAH.

21:54.771 --> 21:57.523
DOESN'T IT KICK ASS?

21:59.818 --> 22:02.111
OH, THAT VADER'S GOT 'EM.

22:02.279 --> 22:04.822
THERE'S NO WAY OUT OF THIS.

22:04.990 --> 22:07.825
IS THIS A TRUE STORY?

22:07.993 --> 22:10.494
YEAH.

22:12.748 --> 22:15.916
THAT VOICE... OH.

22:16.084 --> 22:19.420
JAMES EARL JONES.

22:19.588 --> 22:21.714
ERIC ACTUALLY LIKE THIS?

22:21.882 --> 22:23.591
THAT KID'S ON DOPE.
