<i>Steven: This is it, folks.</i>

00:04.835 --> 00:08.028
Rookie sensation Steven
Universe readies his

00:08.029 --> 00:11.221
last spoonful of Kernel's
classic creamed corn.

00:11.222 --> 00:16.270
As the crowd waits with bated
breath, one bite between him

00:16.338 --> 00:20.574
and destiny.
[chomp!] [gulp!]

00:20.675 --> 00:25.246
And he's done it! He's eaten
four cans of creamed corn!

00:25.313 --> 00:28.349
- Pearl: Good afternoon, Steven.
- Steven: Guys, check this out!

00:28.416 --> 00:31.218
Amethyst: Stu-man in the house.
Whatcha got? Whatcha got?

00:31.286 --> 00:35.489
Steven: I got four empty cans of
Colonel Kernel's classic creamed corn.

00:35.557 --> 00:39.226
- Garnet: Cool.
- Steven: Yeah. And on the back are $5 coupons

00:39.294 --> 00:42.530
for mini golf. I ate four cans
so that we could all go together.

00:42.597 --> 00:46.400
Pearl: That's so thoughtful, Steven.
Unfortunately, though, uh...

00:46.468 --> 00:49.737
- Amethyst: We got to go on a mission.
- Steven: What?

00:49.838 --> 00:52.773
Not again! But you guys
promised we'd hang out.

00:52.841 --> 00:55.676
Garnet: A dangerous artifact has
appeared in the Northern hemisphere.

00:55.744 --> 00:59.113
- We need to go retrieve it.
- Steven: But mini golf is so much fun!

00:59.180 --> 01:02.403
There's castles and windmills
and I like it and ...

01:02.404 --> 01:04.552
Oh, look! Look what I brought.

01:04.619 --> 01:09.690
I pulled out my Dad's old clubs and
also found a pair of his old golf pants.

01:09.758 --> 01:15.052
They're a little big on me, but you
can wear them, Garnet. [both chuckle]

01:16.464 --> 01:19.633
- Amethyst: See you, buddy.
- Pearl: We'll bring you something back.

01:22.304 --> 01:26.540
Steven: Well, you're not the only ones
with a dangerous adventure to tackle.

01:26.808 --> 01:30.478
<i>Oh, yeah! You received
the mythril putter.</i>

01:30.479 --> 01:34.148
<i>Doo-doo-doot-doot
doot-doo!</i>

01:34.215 --> 01:39.708
<i>"Don't worry, professor, we're
gonna sink 'em all!" [chuckles]</i>

01:40.155 --> 01:41.347
<i>Uh-oh!</i>

01:44.721 --> 01:48.475
<i>Oh, windmill, why must we always fight?</i>

01:51.666 --> 01:56.203
- Par!
- Steven: Man, it would have been just like this.

01:56.271 --> 01:59.473
[beeping]
[beeping continues]

02:01.376 --> 02:08.414
<i>Steven: "I can't lose! I am the
greatest golfer in the universe!"</i>

02:08.483 --> 02:12.553
[mimics explosions] [laughs]
All right!

02:12.621 --> 02:17.658
- Secret ending!
- Pearl: Hey, Steven. We're back.

02:17.726 --> 02:23.830
<i>- Steven: Hey.
- Project F.L.O.G.? That's "golf" backwards.</i>

02:24.700 --> 02:26.867
- What is this?
- Amethyst: Hey, Steven.

02:26.868 --> 02:31.338
- Want to hear about where we've been?
- Steven: Uh, oh ... wait! Wait! Hold on.

02:31.406 --> 02:36.410
<i>June 9, 2014?
But that was the day he disappeared...</i>

02:36.478 --> 02:38.799
- Steven: Hey!
- Garnet: Steven, look at this.

02:38.800 --> 02:43.350
- Amethyst: It's the wailing stone we found.
- Garnet: The wailing stone I found.

02:43.418 --> 02:46.253
Pearl: Isn't it neat?
It uses high-frequency sound waves...

02:46.321 --> 02:48.389
- Steven: Guys...
- Pearl: ...with a message relay between

02:48.490 --> 02:51.058
- two fixed points...
- Amethyst: You just have to push this!

02:51.126 --> 02:57.113
[whir!, screech!]
[pop!]

02:57.148 --> 02:59.266
Pearl: Amethyst, I told you

02:59.334 --> 03:02.169
- not to turn it on in the house.
- Amethyst: [laughs] Chill out, P.

03:02.237 --> 03:07.574
It's not like anyone got hurt,
and Steven loved it. Steven?

03:07.642 --> 03:11.111
Steven: That was the secret ending!
Now I have to replay the final

03:11.179 --> 03:15.850
dungeon all over again. It's not fair!
I can't go mini golfing, I can't play

03:15.851 --> 03:20.521
my game, I can't stop going to the
bathroom 'cause I ate all that creamed corn.

03:20.588 --> 03:26.260
So much corn. [sighs]
I just wish I had a place for myself.

03:26.327 --> 03:27.761
[humming]

03:27.762 --> 03:30.631
Huh? My gem!

03:30.699 --> 03:32.100
[humming intensifies]

03:32.101 --> 03:37.892
Pearl: Rose's door. Steven, your
gem is opening your mother's room.

03:39.754 --> 03:42.309
- Steven: Whoa.
- Pearl: Steven, wait!

03:42.377 --> 03:46.207
- Garnet: Steven, don't go in there!
- Steven: It's never about what I want to do, is it?

03:46.242 --> 03:51.385
Well, now I have a place where
I'm going, and you can't come!

03:51.453 --> 03:56.297
- All: Steven!
- Steven: [panting] Yes!

03:56.491 --> 04:02.542
<i>Whoa.
So, this is my Mom's room?</i>

04:02.577 --> 04:04.198
She must have liked clouds a lot.

04:04.299 --> 04:06.834
But what kind of room
doesn't even have a bed?

04:06.901 --> 04:10.370
Aah!
Cool. Hmm.

04:10.438 --> 04:14.568
This bed is pretty nice, but you
know what would be really nice?

04:14.843 --> 04:19.245
Quadruple bunk beds!

04:19.314 --> 04:22.576
[gasps] With a slide.

04:22.577 --> 04:24.752
Whoo-hoo!

04:24.819 --> 04:29.023
A parachute! [laughs]

04:30.427 --> 04:35.095
What next? Hmm. Um...
A tiny floating whale?

04:35.163 --> 04:37.431
[whale sings]

04:37.432 --> 04:39.700
Steven: [giggles] Wow.

04:39.768 --> 04:43.671
Here I get anything I ask for.
But you know what I really want?

04:43.672 --> 04:48.075
I want to see the end of my game
without being interrupted.

04:54.282 --> 04:59.186
<i>It's me, your father. After decades
of cryo-stasis, I'm finally free.</i>

04:59.254 --> 05:02.656
<i>Saving the day is
just par for the course.</i>

05:03.124 --> 05:09.563
Steven: Awesome. [yawns]
Hmm. Kind of hungry now.

05:09.631 --> 05:12.533
[laughs]
All right. Wha...?

05:12.600 --> 05:16.753
Hey! I want a real doughnut.

05:16.754 --> 05:18.138
What?!

05:18.206 --> 05:20.267
Can you believe this?
[whale sings]

05:20.268 --> 05:23.410
Now I have to go out  for doughnuts.

05:25.313 --> 05:30.317
Steven: Don't get excited, guys.
I'm only back for a second.

05:30.385 --> 05:33.987
Well... good. I didn't
want to see you anyway.

05:35.723 --> 05:39.660
Steven: Hey! How's my
favorite fine-foods franchise?

05:39.727 --> 05:42.436
So, I'm thinking double-chocolate
cinnamon twist with

05:42.437 --> 05:46.890
sprinkles on the side.
You know I like to dip.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.340
Uh... Steven to Sadie and Lars.

05:53.408 --> 05:56.310
- Is this, like, a joke or something?
- Together: Hello, Steven.

05:56.377 --> 05:59.713
- What kind of doughnut would you like?
- Steven: Uh, I just said ...

05:59.781 --> 06:02.282
- Together: It's very nice to see you, Steven.
- Steven: Well, it's very nice

06:02.350 --> 06:04.218
- to see you, too.
- Together: Here are your doughnuts.

06:04.285 --> 06:06.787
- Steven: Wait. You guys, I only ordered ...
- Together: Okay.

06:06.855 --> 06:10.324
- We love you, Steven. Bye-bye now.
- Steven: Wait!

06:10.425 --> 06:14.152
Where are you guys going?
I still haven't paid for these.

06:14.153 --> 06:17.915
You guys, hold on a ... sec.

06:18.385 --> 06:20.500
Huh? Hey, Onion!

06:20.568 --> 06:25.317
Have you seen Lars and Sadie?
They should have just been out here.

06:26.708 --> 06:31.211
Hey, if you see them, let me know, okay?
Here. Have a doughnut.

06:35.149 --> 06:38.051
I'll leave it here for you.
See you later.

06:39.654 --> 06:43.866
All the lights are
on, but no one's here.

06:44.809 --> 06:48.055
Pee dee?

06:48.463 --> 06:51.832
Oh. Fry bits.
Usually I'm all about the bits,

06:51.900 --> 06:55.779
but I'm feeling kind
of spooked right now.

06:58.565 --> 06:59.740
Gah!

06:59.841 --> 07:02.776
Uh, you know what? I think I'm
gonna go look around some more.

07:02.844 --> 07:04.411
See you later, Frybo.

07:17.058 --> 07:20.091
Aah!
[breathing heavily]

07:21.078 --> 07:23.196
Connie!

07:23.264 --> 07:28.413
I can't believe it's you.
When did you get back in town? Huh?

07:28.536 --> 07:30.092
Aah! The water!

07:30.093 --> 07:33.206
Connie, what's happening?
Where is everyone?

07:33.274 --> 07:35.896
- He was incredible!
- Steven: Uh?

07:35.897 --> 07:38.945
<i>He was incredible!
He was incredible!</i>

07:38.946 --> 07:41.856
- Steven: Wh-wh-what?
- He was incredible!

07:41.891 --> 07:45.403
Steven: Get me out of here!
What's wrong with your faces?

07:45.438 --> 07:48.110
Lion, you too?!

07:49.983 --> 07:51.194
[gasps]

07:51.195 --> 07:54.828
Can someone please explain this?!

07:54.896 --> 07:58.747
Huh!
[exclaims] [thud!]

08:00.138 --> 08:03.770
- Steven!
- Steven: Dad? Is that you?

08:03.838 --> 08:06.199
What? Of course. Are
you doing all right?

08:06.200 --> 08:09.745
You look like you saw a ghost.
Either that or you stayed

08:09.780 --> 08:12.768
-  up all night playing a video game.
- Steven: Dad, I'm freaking out.

08:12.803 --> 08:15.382
I feel like I'm stuck
inside of some crazy dream.

08:15.483 --> 08:17.417
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

08:17.418 --> 08:19.496
Why don't we share
some of those doughnuts

08:19.575 --> 08:23.352
and you can tell me about this
crazy night you're having? [chomp!]

08:25.226 --> 08:28.395
Steven: The gems were trying to
tell me something about Mom's room.

08:28.463 --> 08:30.447
But I was so mad I didn't listen.

08:30.448 --> 08:33.821
They're always leaving me behind, and ...

08:33.856 --> 08:37.169
- I guess I wanted to do it to them, too.
- That's not so bad.

08:37.238 --> 08:41.140
Everyone needs some alone time
now and then. [mimics guitar riff]

08:41.208 --> 08:44.711
[chomp!]
Steven: [chuckles] Yeah, it was really fun

08:44.812 --> 08:49.383
for a while. But now, the whole city ...
everyone and everything is

08:49.450 --> 08:54.321
- acting really weird.
- Well, the important thing is you told the truth.

08:54.389 --> 08:57.258
Yeah... I... guess I did.

08:57.259 --> 09:00.127
[mimics guitar riff]
[chomp!]

09:00.194 --> 09:04.598
Steven: Uh, Dad? Your advice
is making less sense than usual.

09:04.699 --> 09:07.641
Well, the important thing
is family and friendship,

09:07.642 --> 09:09.603
honesty, values, and
no one got arrested.

09:09.670 --> 09:13.073
[mimics guitar riff]
[chomp!]

09:19.113 --> 09:22.716
Steven: Aah! I'm still in the room!
All of this ...

09:22.784 --> 09:26.219
it's all a fake-a-roo!
[mimics guitar riff] [gasps]

09:26.287 --> 09:27.329
Aah!

09:27.330 --> 09:30.457
This is all wrong! Huh?

09:30.558 --> 09:35.046
Aah!
[breathing heavily]

09:39.789 --> 09:47.332
[exclaims]

09:49.110 --> 09:53.345
[breathing heavily]
Aaaaah!

09:54.861 --> 09:58.584
- I don't want this.
- What do you want, Steven?

09:58.619 --> 10:01.726
Steven: I want to be back
with the gems.

10:04.047 --> 10:05.486
[grunts]

10:05.487 --> 10:09.128
[gasps] Garnet!
[chomp!]

10:09.163 --> 10:11.406
- Garnet: Ow.
- Steven: You're not clouds!

10:11.441 --> 10:14.912
- Amethyst: All right, Steven! [chomps!]
- Pearl: [exclaims]

10:14.947 --> 10:18.538
Steven: Guys, it was awful. I was trapped
in a messed-up version of Beach City.

10:18.606 --> 10:21.842
- Everyone was acting super weird and ...
- Amethyst: You had Rose's room

10:21.909 --> 10:25.278
- build the whole town?!
- Pearl: It can't handle a task like that.

10:25.346 --> 10:31.418
- Thank goodness you're okay.
- Steven: [sighs] I'm sorry I got mad, guys.

10:31.486 --> 10:35.222
I get it now. Things can't
always go exactly how I want.

10:35.289 --> 10:38.810
- Pearl: Oh, Steven, we're sorry, too.
- Amethyst: Mm-hmm.

10:38.845 --> 10:42.650
Garnet: But guess what.
We have time to hang out now. [gasps]

10:43.989 --> 10:47.660
Steven: I always get what I want!

10:49.972 --> 10:53.202
