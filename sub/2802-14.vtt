00:07.466 --> 00:11.178
As you're aware,
Matthew Keller pled down to manslaughter

00:11.261 --> 00:12.804
after you two brought him in for murder.

00:12.888 --> 00:15.390
-Yeah?
-His sentencing was this week.

00:15.474 --> 00:16.934
Yeah, he got 20 years at Barksdale.

00:17.017 --> 00:20.479
Yesterday, he contacted
the Department of Justice.

00:20.562 --> 00:24.024
He says he has information
critical to national security.

00:24.107 --> 00:26.527
His sentencing didn't go well,
now he wants a deal.

00:26.610 --> 00:27.819
HUGHES: Probably.

00:27.903 --> 00:29.905
But we do that sometimes, Caffrey.

00:29.988 --> 00:32.282
We make deals with con men.

00:32.366 --> 00:33.742
What did Homeland Security say?

00:33.825 --> 00:36.537
Keller wouldn't talk to them.
He insisted he would only talk to you.

00:36.620 --> 00:39.873
Neal's right. I seriously doubt
he has any real information.

00:39.957 --> 00:42.668
There's no harm checking it out.
Go talk to him.

00:45.295 --> 00:46.630
Who is this guy?

00:46.713 --> 00:50.801
He's an old rival of Neal's.
They were baccarat partners in Morocco.

00:50.884 --> 00:54.930
Backgammon in Monaco. Close.
And we were never partners.

00:55.013 --> 00:57.933
Hmm, a contemporary of Neal's.
This I gotta see.

00:58.016 --> 01:01.770
No. He's not what you'd expect.
A little more Ratso Rizzo than Cary Grant.

01:03.272 --> 01:06.191
-I'm Cary Grant?
-Only by comparison to Ratso Rizzo.

01:06.275 --> 01:08.193
(BUZZER SOUNDS)

01:09.987 --> 01:11.655
MAN: Boys, ready.

01:24.126 --> 01:26.461
Agent Burke and Mr. Neal Caffrey.

01:27.588 --> 01:29.756
Thanks for coming, gents. I appreciate it.

01:30.382 --> 01:31.967
Thank you, O'Donnell.

01:33.177 --> 01:35.053
Doing all right for yourself, Keller.

01:35.137 --> 01:37.306
Eh, meager touches, but I get by.

01:38.891 --> 01:40.267
Dominican-rolled.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.188
The, uh, tobacco was infused
with Louis XIII Cognac.

01:44.271 --> 01:45.689
They're delicious. Please.

01:51.403 --> 01:53.155
You have information for us?

01:55.324 --> 01:58.118
I understand. You're on the job.

01:58.202 --> 01:59.786
What about you, Neal, huh?

02:00.954 --> 02:02.664
Is this business or pleasure?

02:02.748 --> 02:04.583
It's always a pleasure
seeing you behind bars.

02:04.666 --> 02:07.211
Well, we're all
in prison of sorts, aren't we?

02:07.294 --> 02:09.004
It's the life we make out of it
that matters.

02:09.087 --> 02:11.340
I mean, you've made the most
out of your prison sentence

02:11.423 --> 02:12.758
working for the feds.

02:13.926 --> 02:15.594
I think I'd like to do the same.

02:15.677 --> 02:17.054
What do you want, Keller?

02:18.555 --> 02:20.140
A game, Caffrey?

02:22.935 --> 02:24.228
There it is.

02:30.734 --> 02:34.571
I feel like I've made a home
for myself here, you know?

02:34.655 --> 02:36.156
I've nested.

02:36.240 --> 02:38.325
And now they wanna move me
somewhere less welcoming.

02:38.408 --> 02:43.080
Yeah. Barksdale supermax.
Don't think they chill the port there.

02:43.163 --> 02:44.581
Yeah, you're right.

02:44.665 --> 02:48.919
The inmates don't realize
why port should be lightly chilled.

02:49.002 --> 02:52.089
You're a skilled people person.
I'm sure you'll be fine.

02:52.172 --> 02:55.217
I don't know.
A lot of Russian mob at Barksdale.

02:55.300 --> 02:56.969
That's right.
You have a problem with them.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.554
Seven-figure debt as I recall.

02:58.637 --> 03:00.722
There's another reason
why I wanna stay here.

03:01.890 --> 03:04.726
Which brings me to my proposal.

03:04.810 --> 03:07.271
You familiar with the term <i>"pis aller"?</i>

03:08.480 --> 03:10.107
My French is a little rusty.

03:10.899 --> 03:12.234
It's a move of last resort.

03:13.527 --> 03:15.237
Something you do
when you're out of options.

03:15.320 --> 03:20.492
Well, now if I had information
of a maker of forged passports,

03:20.576 --> 03:22.911
I imagine that would be of value.

03:22.995 --> 03:25.080
What are you looking for in exchange?

03:26.164 --> 03:27.291
I'd like to stay here.

03:27.374 --> 03:28.584
-No.
-(KELLER CHUCKLES)

03:29.626 --> 03:31.920
Relax, Neal. All right?

03:32.004 --> 03:35.174
It's not like I'm asking to be let loose
on the streets of New York

03:35.257 --> 03:37.676
with only an anklet
to control my compulsions.

03:38.927 --> 03:42.014
And I am hoping, Agent Burke,
that this could lead

03:42.097 --> 03:44.683
to an ongoing relationship between you,
me, and the Bureau.

03:44.766 --> 03:47.603
You're already scheduled
to be transferred, Keller.

03:47.686 --> 03:49.313
We're pretty late in the process.

03:49.396 --> 03:51.231
That's why I asked for you.

03:52.566 --> 03:55.652
These are perfect passports.
Caffrey quality.

03:55.736 --> 03:57.821
Just the thing
for terrorists and smugglers.

03:59.281 --> 04:02.075
No promises,
but if your information pans out,

04:02.159 --> 04:03.994
I'll see what I can do.

04:05.704 --> 04:07.623
I appreciate your candor.

04:07.706 --> 04:09.833
I can see why Neal trusts you.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.710
The guy's name is Jason Lang.

04:13.337 --> 04:14.421
Look him up.

04:17.716 --> 04:20.177
Okay, Neal, time to go.

04:21.845 --> 04:23.138
NEAL: <i>Pis aller…</i>

04:24.556 --> 04:26.725
can also mean the worst thing
that can happen.

04:26.808 --> 04:28.644
(CELL DOOR OPENS)

04:30.395 --> 04:32.814
We're both running
out of options, Caffrey.

04:37.528 --> 04:38.904
It's your move.

04:40.948 --> 04:42.950
(THEME MUSIC PLAYING)

04:55.045 --> 04:57.923
Hey. See you later, Satchmo.

05:03.971 --> 05:07.724
El, have you seen my jacket?
The blue pinstripe.

05:08.809 --> 05:10.811
-ELIZABETH: Yeah. I've got it.
-Okay.

05:12.646 --> 05:13.897
Is it this one?

05:13.981 --> 05:16.149
Yeah. Oh.

05:17.442 --> 05:18.944
You have a meeting today.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.363
I was supposed to pick up
the dry cleaning last night.

05:21.446 --> 05:22.948
I am so sorry.

05:23.031 --> 05:24.950
Honey, it's okay. I got it.

05:26.034 --> 05:27.327
Ugh.

05:29.079 --> 05:30.664
Wait… Wait a minute.

05:30.747 --> 05:33.834
You never called to remind me.
Did you assume I'd forget?

05:33.917 --> 05:35.335
I know you had a lot on your mind.

05:35.419 --> 05:38.714
Yeah, but I don't wanna be the husband
that forgets to pick up the dry cleaning.

05:38.797 --> 05:41.175
-That's sweet.
-But I am.

05:41.258 --> 05:43.051
Ugh. Relax, okay?

05:43.135 --> 05:44.303
I'm not mad.

05:44.386 --> 05:46.638
Yes, you are
and you're gonna hold on to it all day.

05:46.722 --> 05:49.683
Really? Would I really do that?

05:50.559 --> 05:51.852
No, never.

05:51.935 --> 05:54.188
Okay, you're the one
who forgot the dry cleaning.

05:54.271 --> 05:55.689
-See?
-(WHIMPERS)

05:57.399 --> 05:58.817
Now you scared the dog.

05:58.901 --> 06:01.945
(GROANS) Add that
to my list of imperfections.

06:02.029 --> 06:06.825
Okay, look. I don't wanna be the wife
that has to call and nag you to do things.

06:06.909 --> 06:09.286
Plus it's a lot more effort
to try and remind you,

06:09.369 --> 06:10.996
and I don't even know if
you're gonna remember.

06:11.079 --> 06:13.624
I'm sorry. I didn't realize
I was such a foregone conclusion.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.459
Neither did I. Can we stop this?

06:15.542 --> 06:17.044
Yes. Please.

06:17.127 --> 06:19.463
-Okay. I've gotta go to work.
-Me, too.

06:23.967 --> 06:25.677
Have a wonderful day.

06:28.555 --> 06:29.556
You, too.

06:40.442 --> 06:42.778

06:42.861 --> 06:44.655

-(SATCHMO GROANS)

06:49.701 --> 06:51.870
MOZZIE: So, what do you
think Keller wants?

06:51.954 --> 06:53.872
NEAL: Well, he's set up like a king
in Hawthorne Fed.

06:53.956 --> 06:56.667
Smoking Gurkhas, sipping port,
reading the <i>Times.</i>

06:56.750 --> 06:58.710
As much as I loathe schadenfreude,

06:58.794 --> 07:01.046
it would be nice to know
that Keller is suffering.

07:01.129 --> 07:03.632
Well, if they send him to Barksdale,
the Russians will take care of that.

07:03.715 --> 07:06.969
Can you trust the suit
to not keep him at Hawthorne?

07:07.052 --> 07:08.512
His transfer is later today.

07:08.595 --> 07:13.100
And you're heading to the office
to check out what Keller told you?

07:13.183 --> 07:14.893
He's desperate. This is his last play.

07:14.977 --> 07:17.104
What about Kate?

07:17.187 --> 07:18.397
What about her?

07:18.480 --> 07:20.566
Well, Keller's used her
to provoke you before.

07:20.649 --> 07:21.650
He may do it again.

07:21.733 --> 07:23.110
Keller can bring up Kate.

07:23.193 --> 07:25.487
He can offer Peter deals.
He can even beat me at chess.

07:25.571 --> 07:26.989
-He's winning the chess game?
-No.

07:27.072 --> 07:30.409
But my point,
forged passports won't stop the transfer

07:30.492 --> 07:31.827
and I've moved past Kate.

07:33.287 --> 07:34.830
I have, Mozz.

07:35.622 --> 07:36.748
Clearly.

07:37.791 --> 07:41.336
Look, she'll always be a part of me,
but I have to move on.

07:41.420 --> 07:42.504
Okay.

07:49.344 --> 07:50.846
-Hey. What's going on?
-Hey.

07:50.929 --> 07:52.556
I've figured out Keller's game.

07:52.639 --> 07:54.933
He wants us to investigate
this Jason Lang.

07:55.017 --> 07:57.186
Forger-turned-photographer
in the Lower East Side.

07:57.269 --> 07:59.354
-So he said.
-Yeah, but here's where it gets good.

07:59.438 --> 08:01.815
Keller and Lang were suspected
of working together

08:01.899 --> 08:04.193
on the Belmont bond forgeries
three years ago.

08:04.276 --> 08:06.528
-They were partners?
-Yeah. But it went south

08:06.612 --> 08:08.197
and Keller took two bullets.

08:10.199 --> 08:11.909
From Lang's gun.

08:11.992 --> 08:13.452
I spoke to the case agent.

08:13.535 --> 08:16.997
He said that the partnership dissolved
and Lang destroyed the bonds.

08:17.080 --> 08:19.124
Keller is going for a trifecta.

08:19.208 --> 08:22.085
Take out the man who shot him,
secure his stay in a federal hotel room

08:22.169 --> 08:24.171
and tweak me in the process. Next case.

08:24.254 --> 08:25.672
Yeah, not so fast.

08:25.756 --> 08:28.884
Hughes still wants us to find out
if Lang is making phony passports.

08:28.967 --> 08:31.053
Oh, don't tell me
we have to make a deal with Keller.

08:31.136 --> 08:34.723
Relax. We're not gonna release
Keller on an anklet.

08:34.806 --> 08:36.558
Unless June has a spare bedroom.

08:36.642 --> 08:38.060
-That's not funny.
-You're right.

08:38.143 --> 08:40.062
-You're nothing like Keller.
-Because he's a killer.

08:40.145 --> 08:42.397
Well, there's that.
And he had cigars in his cell.

08:42.481 --> 08:44.816
I remember your prison cell. No cigars.

08:44.900 --> 08:46.693
When you're done,
I'd like to go visit Lang's studio.

08:46.777 --> 08:49.238
All right. I'm just saying,
you know, he had a Tiffany lamp.

08:49.321 --> 08:50.531
So did my mom.

08:54.076 --> 08:56.787
NEAL: What's wrong?
PETER: Nothing.

08:56.870 --> 08:57.871
Aw, come on.

08:57.955 --> 09:00.040
Your sarcasm goes up in direct proportion
to your stress level.

09:00.123 --> 09:02.751
It's Elizabeth.
I forgot to pick up the dry cleaning.

09:02.835 --> 09:05.504
-Well, it happens.
-Apparently, all the time.

09:05.587 --> 09:07.673
I've become the guy
who forgets to do it so often

09:07.756 --> 09:10.342
that she had to pick it up
without even asking me if I got it.

09:10.425 --> 09:12.427
-She was angry?
-No.

09:12.511 --> 09:14.263
-And that's bad?
-Yes.

09:14.346 --> 09:15.931
I'm a constant disappointment.

09:16.014 --> 09:18.350
-Did she say that?
-Implied.

09:18.433 --> 09:20.727
Maybe she finds
your forgetfulness endearing.

09:20.811 --> 09:22.771
I don't want her to find
my forgetfulness endearing.

09:22.855 --> 09:25.232
The worst part
is when she left this morning,

09:25.315 --> 09:26.692
I didn't call her "hon."

09:26.775 --> 09:30.362
Hmm. Have you ever seen
an actual fight? Because…

09:30.445 --> 09:33.532
It's our own little abbreviation
for saying "I love you."

09:34.575 --> 09:37.703
When we first got married,
I used to say, "I love you, honey."

09:37.786 --> 09:40.706
Then it became, "Love you, honey."
Then, "Honey."

09:40.789 --> 09:43.792
Now all we need to say is "hon."

09:44.710 --> 09:46.003
Very efficient.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.839
Point is, I didn't say it.

09:49.923 --> 09:54.261
Look, call her, leave her a voicemail,
and say "hon" before you hang up.

09:54.344 --> 09:55.721
Did I miss anything?

09:57.222 --> 09:59.516
No. I'll call her
as soon as we're done here.

10:00.642 --> 10:01.768
Okay.

you know?

10:50.067 --> 10:52.361
Just take a look at my price list.
I think you'll see that

for an illegal side business.

-Oh, come on. Take a break.

-Will you excuse me?
-Certainly.

10:59.743 --> 11:00.827
This is Jason.

11:10.128 --> 11:12.631
I don't like this guy. What do you think?

11:12.714 --> 11:14.758
Truesdale color-shifting printer.

11:14.842 --> 11:16.593
Hmm. That would be an important tool

11:16.677 --> 11:19.054
in making color-shifting images
in the US passport.

11:19.137 --> 11:22.140
So would the Metrolux 5200,
which is only used for one purpose.

11:22.224 --> 11:25.477
-Making holographic images.
-Also found in US passports.

11:25.561 --> 11:26.979
It's a nice cover.

11:28.355 --> 11:31.233
He integrates holograms into his artwork.

11:32.317 --> 11:33.861
Is this enough to bring him in?

11:33.944 --> 11:36.196
It's enough for us to get a warrant.

11:36.280 --> 11:37.656
Hey.

11:37.739 --> 11:40.242
Lang, I need to talk to you
about your equipment here.

11:40.325 --> 11:41.493
Lang. Hey, Lang.

11:41.577 --> 11:43.620
-I'll follow. Stay here.
-Okay.

11:52.004 --> 11:53.213
Lang?

12:01.096 --> 12:02.306
This was a setup.

12:04.892 --> 12:07.978
Drop your weapon and your cell
and get in the van.

12:08.979 --> 12:10.022
Peter.

12:15.611 --> 12:17.112

(RINGING)

12:34.004 --> 12:35.088
Hello?

12:35.172 --> 12:37.591
You lost a key piece, Caffrey.

12:37.674 --> 12:39.676
God damn it, Keller. This is isn't a game.

12:39.760 --> 12:41.553
Of course it is. Life is a game.

12:42.554 --> 12:45.349
If you stop playing, Peter Burke will die.

13:01.573 --> 13:03.867
LANG: Hey, check the doors upstairs.

13:09.289 --> 13:11.333
You're working with Keller.

13:11.416 --> 13:12.876
What makes you say that?

13:12.960 --> 13:16.463
Keller turned us on to you.
So obviously you made a deal with him.

13:16.547 --> 13:18.507
He's gonna betray you.

13:18.590 --> 13:21.176
Well, why don't you
let me deal with Keller

13:21.260 --> 13:22.761
and you worry about yourself?

13:22.845 --> 13:24.638
-I'm not worried.
-Hmm, you should be.

13:24.721 --> 13:26.431
-No, you should be.
-(SCOFFS)

13:26.515 --> 13:28.100
You kidnapped a federal agent.

13:28.183 --> 13:30.185
You're gonna have the full might
of the US government

13:30.269 --> 13:32.437
-closing around your neck.
-Time to shut up.

13:32.521 --> 13:34.731
Here's what I already know.

13:34.815 --> 13:36.441
We made a left on Houston

13:36.525 --> 13:38.735
then made a wide right
about a minute later

13:38.819 --> 13:41.446
driving straight
for about eight minutes or so

13:41.530 --> 13:43.240
in stop-and-go traffic.

13:43.323 --> 13:48.245
We're in the Garment District,
8th or 9th Avenue, and about 38th Street.

13:49.913 --> 13:52.374
You're not wearing a mask
and I'm not dead.

13:52.457 --> 13:54.209
So you still need me for something.

13:54.293 --> 13:58.755
Before this goes any further,
let's work something out.

13:58.839 --> 14:04.511
You know, I've gone down that road before,
and I trust you less than I trust Keller.

14:04.595 --> 14:06.930
I don't know
who you've dealt with in the past,

14:07.014 --> 14:08.390
but I keep my word.

14:08.473 --> 14:09.850
(CHUCKLES)

14:11.435 --> 14:13.604
You know, every few months

14:13.687 --> 14:17.065
a different agent comes by
investigating a different crime

14:17.149 --> 14:21.445
and he tells me that if I don't cooperate,
he's gonna make my life a living hell.

14:21.528 --> 14:22.696
And he does.

14:22.779 --> 14:24.990
-I can help you with that.
-How?

14:25.073 --> 14:27.659
I mean, you can't stop the Bureau
from playing politics.

14:27.743 --> 14:28.952
It just never ends.

14:29.036 --> 14:33.081
Look, whatever you're planning,
Keller has something else in mind.

14:33.165 --> 14:37.628
You are gonna wind up dead or in prison
unless we work something out.

14:37.711 --> 14:39.338
(GUNSHOT)

14:40.130 --> 14:41.507
No more deals.

14:42.132 --> 14:43.258
Okay?

14:48.222 --> 14:50.224
KELLER: You'd better protect your king.

14:52.684 --> 14:53.894
Where's Peter?

14:55.646 --> 14:57.940
It's stuffy in here.

14:58.023 --> 14:59.608
Let's go for a walk.

14:59.691 --> 15:01.777
NEAL: I know you won't think twice
about killing him,

15:01.860 --> 15:03.529
so I haven't told the FBI.

15:03.612 --> 15:07.199
It's best not to discuss
personal matters with everybody, Neal.

15:07.282 --> 15:09.618
Yeah. But they're gonna
find out soon enough.

15:10.827 --> 15:13.664
You seem upset, Caffrey. You know?

15:13.747 --> 15:16.917
I mean, clearly you're dealing
with a big problem here.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.503
And I wish I could help,
but I got problems, too.

15:19.586 --> 15:22.673
See, since Burke didn't stop my transfer,

15:22.756 --> 15:25.092
they're shipping me off
to Barksdale later today.

15:25.175 --> 15:29.346
Now, my sources tell me that I, too,
face dire circumstances

15:29.429 --> 15:31.640
unless my debts
with the Russians gets paid.

15:31.723 --> 15:33.809
-How much do you owe them?
-$2.5 million.

15:35.018 --> 15:37.563
And once my problem goes away, then…

15:37.646 --> 15:40.732
Maybe then I can help you with yours.

15:40.816 --> 15:42.734
I don't have $2.5 million.

15:43.861 --> 15:45.863
Neal, how long have we known each other?

15:45.946 --> 15:48.448
Everything is gone, Keller.

15:48.532 --> 15:50.284
I've had to use my resources

15:50.367 --> 15:52.077
since my current activities
are a little limited.

15:52.160 --> 15:54.788
That's true. You do have expensive tastes.

15:54.872 --> 15:56.832
But I recall a night in Scotland

15:56.915 --> 15:58.917
when you acquired something
worth that amount.

15:59.001 --> 16:00.294
That was six years ago.

16:01.086 --> 16:03.005
I'm fairly certain you held on to it.

16:03.088 --> 16:05.674
I didn't. I didn't have any use for it.

16:05.757 --> 16:08.051
Well, I do. So find it.

16:09.219 --> 16:11.930
You got three hours till my transfer.

16:12.014 --> 16:13.390
I'll be in touch.

16:16.768 --> 16:18.478
You're gonna lose, Keller.

16:21.064 --> 16:22.065
Again.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.943

16:35.787 --> 16:38.123
Hey, Neal. If you're looking for Peter,
he's not here.

16:38.207 --> 16:40.542
Yeah, I know. Diana, we got a problem.

16:40.626 --> 16:42.878
Keller and Lang
worked out some kind of deal.

16:42.961 --> 16:44.046
Peter's been taken.

16:47.132 --> 16:49.968
HUGHES: <i>Listen up.</i>
<i>One of our own's been kidnapped.</i>

Now, Graham, I want you to coordinate
eastern and southern districts.

16:52.804 --> 16:55.641
Jones, I want you
with Keller's transfer convoy.

16:55.724 --> 16:58.685
Campanelli, I want wiretaps
within the next two hours

16:58.769 --> 17:03.023
on every cell, home, prison, and business
linked to Keller and Lang.

17:03.106 --> 17:06.109
Under no circumstances
does anyone talk to the press.

17:06.193 --> 17:08.820
This is 24/7 until we find him.
All right, let's do it.

17:08.904 --> 17:10.239
(CHATTERING)

17:12.991 --> 17:15.994
What did Keller tell you at the prison?

17:16.078 --> 17:18.497
He wants $2.5 million
in exchange for Peter.

17:18.580 --> 17:20.958
But Keller doesn't have Peter.
Keller is behind bars.

17:21.041 --> 17:22.793
He's running this.
He called me on Peter's cell

17:22.876 --> 17:24.294
right when Lang drove away with him.

17:24.378 --> 17:27.256
ERT is analyzing the phone.
We put out an APB on the van.

17:27.339 --> 17:30.092
Why does Keller want that kind of money?
He's doing 20 years.

17:30.175 --> 17:31.635
He needs it to pay off the Russian mob

17:31.718 --> 17:33.136
so they don't kill him
when he arrives at Barksdale.

17:33.220 --> 17:35.514
The FBI doesn't negotiate, period.

17:35.597 --> 17:37.140
Particularly with someone
who's already locked up

17:37.224 --> 17:38.267
and fearing for his life.

17:38.350 --> 17:39.977
Sir, all due respect,
Keller doesn't bluff.

17:40.060 --> 17:41.687
He will kill Peter if I don't engage him.

17:41.770 --> 17:45.023
The reason no one takes our men
is because we make it clear

17:45.107 --> 17:46.942
all hell will rain down on them
if they do.

17:47.025 --> 17:50.153
You also have to be willing to sacrifice
a few of your agents to prove your point.

17:50.237 --> 17:54.658
This isn't a one-man con, Neal.
This is the US government.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.493
We will catch Lang.

17:56.577 --> 18:00.038
And we will string Keller up by his thumbs
until he cries for forgiveness.

18:00.122 --> 18:03.000
Protocol dictates
we lock Keller down till this is over.

18:03.083 --> 18:06.170
But that gives him exactly what he wants,
to stay at Hawthorne indefinitely.

18:06.253 --> 18:07.796
You've already contacted the prison?

18:07.880 --> 18:10.507

to Barksdale supermax.

with a seven-foot Russian named Ivan.

Let us do our job.
We'll bring Peter home safely.

Neal, what's going on?

Wait. Wha… What?

19:11.735 --> 19:12.903
Elizabeth.

19:14.404 --> 19:17.366
Every agent in the Bureau
has one goal right now:

19:17.449 --> 19:18.534
To find your husband.

19:18.617 --> 19:20.452
I know. Thank you, Reese.

19:20.536 --> 19:23.705
We're going to post a team at your home
in case he makes contact.

19:23.789 --> 19:27.084
Just, uh, give us a few minutes
and I'll have them take you back.

19:27.167 --> 19:28.293
Okay.

19:32.339 --> 19:33.465
They, um…

19:33.549 --> 19:37.761
They say this is the biggest manhunt
the FBI has run in a decade.

19:37.845 --> 19:40.222
Even I've never seen anything like this.

19:41.807 --> 19:43.642
What do you know about Keller?

19:43.725 --> 19:47.688
He's a chess player.
He thinks ten, twelve moves ahead.

19:47.771 --> 19:50.315
So everything they're doing,
all the helicopters

19:50.399 --> 19:51.900
and the agents knocking on doors…

19:51.984 --> 19:53.777
He would have foreseen that.

19:53.861 --> 19:56.113
-They don't know his endgame.
-No.

19:56.196 --> 19:57.739
What are you doing?

19:59.992 --> 20:02.578
Well, they want me to go home.

20:03.745 --> 20:04.872
Sit tight.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.833
But is that what you're gonna do?

20:09.001 --> 20:10.377
What do you want me to do?

20:11.628 --> 20:13.755
Whatever it takes to bring him home.

20:14.673 --> 20:16.717
DIANA: I'm supposed to be
escorting you home.

20:16.800 --> 20:18.177
I need to meet up with a friend first.

20:18.260 --> 20:20.220
I hope you're not planning
on making a side deal with Keller.

20:20.304 --> 20:22.097
Look, Diana, if this were
any other kidnapper…

20:22.181 --> 20:25.100
Rule one: Never let someone
emotionally involved do the negotiating.

20:25.184 --> 20:26.768
Yeah. If you're willing
to lose your hostage.

20:26.852 --> 20:28.729
I've read the FBI playbook. So has Keller.

20:28.812 --> 20:30.856
Well, why do you think he's so different?

20:32.357 --> 20:34.902
Early in his career,
Keller pulled a three-man job.

20:34.985 --> 20:37.654
The game was pretty straightforward,
nobody got hurt.

20:37.738 --> 20:39.448
While they're walking away from the site,

20:39.531 --> 20:42.409
the third man says he thinks
he left his passport behind.

20:42.492 --> 20:45.454
While he's checking his pockets,
Keller put a bullet in his head.

20:45.537 --> 20:48.290
The guy's passport
was in his back pocket the whole time.

20:48.373 --> 20:50.167
Keller didn't wait to find out.

20:50.250 --> 20:51.835
You were the second man.

20:54.004 --> 20:55.047
If I can engage him,

20:55.130 --> 20:57.466
I can make sure Peter is alive
and figure out a lead.

20:59.218 --> 21:01.220
I can't endorse what you're doing.

21:01.303 --> 21:03.305
What do you think Peter would let me do?

21:06.433 --> 21:08.435
All right, I'm gonna
go get a cup of coffee.

21:08.519 --> 21:09.937
-I'll meet you here in…
-One hour.

21:10.020 --> 21:11.355
-Here.
-Here.

21:15.192 --> 21:16.276
Hey.

21:17.110 --> 21:19.404
-So you ditched Big Brother?
-Brother?

21:19.488 --> 21:22.282
-Big Sister.
-Yeah. She's not gonna follow us.

21:22.366 --> 21:24.284
What's with the second hammer?
I said bring one.

21:24.368 --> 21:25.994
You said to surprise you.

21:26.078 --> 21:28.539
Mozz, you're worried about Peter.

21:28.622 --> 21:30.624
I happen to have an arsenal of hammers.

21:30.707 --> 21:32.960
Look, you've got half an hour
before the exchange.

21:33.043 --> 21:35.379
Unless Keller has developed
a hammer fetish,

21:35.462 --> 21:37.339
I imagine we're smashing something.

21:37.422 --> 21:39.716
You recognize this spot?

21:39.800 --> 21:42.427
I once met a man in this park
who claimed to be John Lennon,

21:42.511 --> 21:43.887
and I believed him.

21:43.971 --> 21:46.932
-The year was 1991.
-Hmm.

21:47.015 --> 21:48.767
NEAL: This is where Kate and I
used to come.

21:51.144 --> 21:53.730
I used to think one day our kids
would play in that playground.

21:54.773 --> 21:56.817
I didn't know you thought about kids.

21:56.900 --> 21:57.985
Yeah.

21:59.278 --> 22:00.863
Thought we'd grow old here.

22:02.072 --> 22:03.323
You were gonna propose?

22:03.407 --> 22:06.994
I had the whole thing worked out, Mozz.
Remember that street violinist?

22:07.077 --> 22:08.120
Caesar.

22:08.203 --> 22:10.247
I had him learn <i>Everybody Loves Somebody.</i>

22:10.330 --> 22:13.584
He was gonna spontaneously
break into it when we passed.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.294
Why didn't you tell me?

22:15.377 --> 22:16.920
Would you have approved?

22:17.004 --> 22:18.964
Perhaps not.

22:19.047 --> 22:23.427
But the name "Uncle Mozzie"
does have a certain je ne sais quoi.

22:23.510 --> 22:25.804
I assume you acquired a ring.

22:25.888 --> 22:26.889
Yeah.

22:33.353 --> 22:36.023
Figured it was safer to leave it here
than in a safety deposit box

36:52.421 --> 36:54.381
Thanks for sticking up for me in there.

36:54.464 --> 36:56.508
I'll let you know
as soon as I hear something, okay?

36:56.592 --> 36:58.218
-(PHONE RINGS)
-This is Jones.

37:00.137 --> 37:01.555
I've got Peter on the line!

37:02.890 --> 37:06.685
Peter, I'm gonna put you on speaker,
start a trace.

37:06.768 --> 37:08.437
HUGHES: Burke.

37:08.520 --> 37:11.064
Burke, it's Hughes. Tell us your location.

37:11.148 --> 37:12.608
PETER: I need to talk to Neal.

37:12.691 --> 37:15.110
-HUGHES: <i>Where are you?</i>
-Reese, put Neal on the phone.

37:15.194 --> 37:17.404
-I'm here, Peter.
-Listen carefully.

37:17.487 --> 37:19.072
I'm in a locked cell.

37:19.156 --> 37:22.242
Lang is three feet away from me
knocked out next to his gun.

37:22.326 --> 37:23.994
Keller is en route.

37:24.077 --> 37:25.454
You need me
to talk you through a jailbreak.

37:25.537 --> 37:26.788
<i>Yeah.</i>

37:28.832 --> 37:31.585
That's… That's my husband.
Put him on speaker.

37:31.668 --> 37:33.045
I'm sorry, ma'am. I'm not authorized.

37:33.128 --> 37:35.756
You have my husband on the line.
Put him on speaker.

37:37.299 --> 37:39.635
The cell is roughly 8-by-12.

37:39.718 --> 37:41.678
It's made of cement and metal bars.

37:41.762 --> 37:43.138
There's a locked hinged door.

37:43.222 --> 37:45.265
Clear a space, 8-by-12 perimeter.

37:45.349 --> 37:47.142
HUGHES: Let's do it.

37:49.394 --> 37:50.479
AGENT: Tape.

37:59.905 --> 38:02.658
The cell is in the middle
of a schmatte-shop basement.

38:02.741 --> 38:05.994
There are cardboard boxes,
an old metal chair,

38:06.078 --> 38:08.038
a can of soda, which was a gift,

38:08.121 --> 38:12.251
<i>two lamps, light bulb, thread, fabric,</i>

38:13.252 --> 38:15.003
and some really creepy mannequins.

38:15.087 --> 38:16.129
NEAL: Okay, tell me about the door.

38:16.922 --> 38:19.007
The cell door has an electronic keypad.

38:19.091 --> 38:21.218
"Fossbender ES320."

38:21.301 --> 38:25.347
Uh, Fossbender chips are hardwired
to a power source plus a backup battery.

38:25.430 --> 38:27.724
Can we disable it with anything here?

38:27.808 --> 38:29.351
NEAL: Uh…
PETER: <i>Neal.</i>

38:29.434 --> 38:32.271
-I'm thinking, Peter.
-Think faster.

38:33.105 --> 38:35.274
All right, look for the hardwire
connection to the lock.

38:36.525 --> 38:39.319
Okay, got it. Feels like a thin gauge.

38:39.403 --> 38:40.737
I'm guessing if I cut it…

38:40.821 --> 38:42.865
You'll activate the lock's
redundancy mechanism.

38:42.948 --> 38:45.534
No. We need… We need to short the backup
before cutting the electricity.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.579
There's a conduit
that runs alongside the cell.

38:48.662 --> 38:50.747
Follow that conduit to the fuse box.

38:50.831 --> 38:52.165
I got it.

38:52.249 --> 38:54.960
<i>It's right in the back wall.</i>
<i>I'm putting you on speaker.</i>

38:58.380 --> 39:00.048
Okay. All right. Uh…

39:00.132 --> 39:01.675
Here's where
it gets a little tricky, Peter.

39:01.758 --> 39:03.177
<i>Pull back the inside panel.</i>

39:03.260 --> 39:05.596
You'll see two hot wires and a neutral.
Strip the neutral.

39:05.679 --> 39:07.347
Hang on.

39:07.431 --> 39:09.808
I gotta make a quick wire stripper
out of the soda can.

39:09.892 --> 39:12.186
Look at you, improvising without me.

39:15.480 --> 39:16.523
PETER: <i>Done.</i>

39:16.607 --> 39:18.609
Okay. Uh…

39:18.692 --> 39:20.068
All right. Break the light bulb

39:20.152 --> 39:22.321
and attach the filament
to the battery of your cell phone.

39:22.404 --> 39:24.281
The filament conducts a charge.

39:24.364 --> 39:27.492
Which creates surge, shorts the power,
and the locking mechanism should release.

39:31.622 --> 39:32.623
Should?

39:32.706 --> 39:34.374
It will.

39:34.458 --> 39:36.919
Has it occurred to you that in order
to use my cell phone battery…

39:37.002 --> 39:39.713
We're gonna have to disconnect.
Final step, Peter.

39:41.215 --> 39:42.466
LANG: Hey.

39:42.549 --> 39:43.675
Oh, God.

39:43.759 --> 39:46.970
We've got a lock on his location.
Textile shop off of 9th and 39th.

39:47.054 --> 39:49.848
HUGHES: <i>Burke, stay on the line.</i>
<i>There's a team on their way.</i>

39:51.642 --> 39:52.893
PETER: <i>There's no time.</i>

39:58.148 --> 40:00.692

-A few seconds.

40:15.582 --> 40:17.709
Hang tight, Peter. We're on our way.

40:17.793 --> 40:20.212
I've got Lang at gunpoint.

40:20.295 --> 40:21.713
All right. Let's go.

40:23.882 --> 40:26.176
You better hurry.
Keller is on his way, too.

40:32.266 --> 40:33.684
JONES: FBI. Don't move.

40:33.767 --> 40:35.686
PETER: Jones, it's me.
JONES: Peter?

40:37.145 --> 40:38.856
AGENT: Okay. Clear around back.

40:39.565 --> 40:41.316
-There he is.
-(CHUCKLES)

40:41.400 --> 40:43.193
Escape artist extraordinaire, Peter Burke.

40:43.277 --> 40:44.528
What happened with Keller?

40:44.611 --> 40:45.946
He hasn't shown.

40:46.029 --> 40:47.823
He won't. He's smarter than that.

40:47.906 --> 40:50.534
Who knows?
Maybe he never planned on showing.

40:50.617 --> 40:52.619
Seeing as how he didn't trust Lang.

40:52.703 --> 40:55.873
Which would've left Lang with the ring,
the debts and you.

40:55.956 --> 40:58.208
Uh, speaking of which.

40:59.418 --> 41:01.211
Oh, right, yeah. Thanks. It's…

41:01.295 --> 41:03.922
Before I hand that back to you,
is it stolen?

41:04.006 --> 41:06.967
Well, it's never been reported as stolen.

41:07.050 --> 41:11.180
Listen, if it's legitimately yours,
the FBI can't hold on to it.

41:11.263 --> 41:14.433
Well, it's been missing
for a couple hundred years, but, uh…

41:15.726 --> 41:17.019
It doesn't belong to me.

41:18.478 --> 41:21.231
So you may wanna contact
the Scotland Royal Museum.

41:22.649 --> 41:23.901
What?

41:33.493 --> 41:34.745

41:39.291 --> 41:40.375

you set up for me.

41:51.970 --> 41:54.348
It's very kind.
I'm sorry I couldn't make it.

41:54.431 --> 41:55.933
Yeah. Me, too.

41:56.016 --> 41:58.185
I couldn't have escaped without you, Neal.

41:59.394 --> 42:01.271
But I guess we both got
what we wanted, right?

42:01.355 --> 42:02.856
I wouldn't say that.

42:02.940 --> 42:04.942
How about we call this one a draw?

42:05.943 --> 42:07.694
Take a break for a while. What do you say?

42:07.778 --> 42:09.988
I'm gonna find you, Keller.

42:10.072 --> 42:11.657
That might be tough.

42:11.740 --> 42:13.408
I'm already outside your radius.
