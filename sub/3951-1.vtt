01:04.113 --> 01:05.823
What the fuck is that?

01:06.533 --> 01:07.700
Jimmy?

01:07.992 --> 01:09.827
- What's up?
- Did I hit something?

01:09.911 --> 01:11.578
What the fuck is that?

01:12.622 --> 01:14.249
Maybe you got a flat?

01:16.000 --> 01:17.085
No.

01:19.003 --> 01:20.964
What the fuck?
You better pull over and see.

01:48.116 --> 01:50.451
He's still alive. You fucking piece of shit!

01:50.535 --> 01:53.371
Die, you motherfucker! Look at me!

02:02.839 --> 02:06.801
<i>As far back as I can remember,</i>
<i>I always wanted to be a gangster.</i>

02:46.758 --> 02:47.884
<i>To me...</i>

02:47.967 --> 02:52.388
<i>being a gangster was better than</i>
<i>being president of the United States.</i>

02:55.558 --> 02:59.145
<i>Even before I first wandered</i>
<i>into the cabstand for an after-school job...</i>

02:59.229 --> 03:01.397
<i>I knew I wanted to be a part of them.</i>

03:01.481 --> 03:03.983
<i>It was there that I knew I belonged.</i>

03:04.067 --> 03:08.655
<i>To me, it meant being somebody</i>
<i>in a neighborhood full of nobodies.</i>

03:08.738 --> 03:11.866
<i>They weren't like anybody else.</i>
<i>They did whatever they wanted.</i>

03:11.950 --> 03:15.662
<i>They double-parked in front of a hydrant,</i>
<i>nobody ever gave them a ticket.</i>

03:15.745 --> 03:18.164
<i>In the summer,</i>
<i>when they played cards all night...</i>

03:18.248 --> 03:20.375
<i>nobody ever called the cops.</i>

03:32.387 --> 03:34.430
Tony Stacks. How are you?

03:35.723 --> 03:37.267
<i>Tuddy Cicero.</i>

03:37.350 --> 03:39.644
Could this be the Canarsie Kid?

03:40.270 --> 03:41.813
- How are you?
- Good.

03:43.106 --> 03:44.274
<i>Tuddy.</i>

03:45.233 --> 03:48.319
<i>Tuddy ran the cabstand</i>
<i>and the Bella Vista Pizzeria...</i>

03:48.403 --> 03:53.074
<i>and other places for his brother, Paul,</i>
<i>who was the boss of the neighborhood.</i>

03:57.662 --> 03:59.956
<i>Paulie might have moved slow...</i>

04:02.417 --> 04:06.421
<i>but it was only because Paulie</i>
<i>didn't have to move for anybody.</i>

04:11.092 --> 04:12.760
- It's your fault.
- You started it.

04:12.844 --> 04:14.929
I started it? It's your fault.

04:15.013 --> 04:19.475
<i>At first my parents loved that I found</i>
<i>a job across the street from the house.</i>

04:20.601 --> 04:24.355
<i>My father, who was Irish,</i>
<i>was sent to work at the age of 11.</i>

04:24.647 --> 04:26.524
<i>He liked that I got myself a job.</i>

04:26.608 --> 04:30.153
<i>He always used to say</i>
<i>that American kids were spoiled lazy.</i>

04:31.946 --> 04:33.615
- Bye, Dad.
- Bye.

04:34.073 --> 04:35.450
See you, Mikey.

04:35.533 --> 04:36.826
Bye, Henry.

04:36.910 --> 04:38.995
Henry! Watch how you cross!

04:39.078 --> 04:40.580
Bring back milk!

04:40.663 --> 04:43.875
<i>My mother was happy after</i>
<i>she found out that the Ciceros...</i>

04:43.958 --> 04:47.587
<i>came from the same part of Sicily</i>
<i>as she did. To my mother...</i>

04:47.670 --> 04:50.465
<i>that was the answer to all her prayers.</i>

04:51.966 --> 04:54.469
<i>I was the luckiest kid in the world.</i>

04:54.552 --> 04:57.472
<i>I could go anywhere, I could do anything.</i>

04:57.555 --> 05:00.225
<i>I knew everybody,</i>
<i>and everybody knew me.</i>

05:00.642 --> 05:03.520
<i>Wiseguys would pull up</i>
<i>and Tuddy would toss me their keys...</i>

05:03.603 --> 05:05.438
<i>and let me park their Cadillacs.</i>

05:05.522 --> 05:09.192
<i>Here I am, this little kid,</i>
<i>I can't even see over the steering wheel...</i>

05:09.275 --> 05:11.486
<i>and I'm parking Cadillacs.</i>

05:14.697 --> 05:16.824
<i>But it wasn't too long...</i>

05:16.908 --> 05:20.828
<i>before my parents changed</i>
<i>their minds about my job at the cabstand.</i>

05:20.912 --> 05:22.497
For your mother and sister.

05:22.580 --> 05:26.167
<i>For them, the cabstand was supposed</i>
<i>to be a part-time job. But for me...</i>

05:26.251 --> 05:28.336
<i>it was definitely full-time.</i>

05:28.419 --> 05:30.421
<i>That's all I wanted to do.</i>

05:30.505 --> 05:34.759
<i>People like my father could never</i>
<i>understand, but I was a part of something.</i>

05:34.843 --> 05:37.679
<i>I belonged. I was treated like a grown-up.</i>

05:38.513 --> 05:39.973
Tell him 519.

05:40.223 --> 05:42.225
<i>Every day I was learning to score.</i>

05:42.308 --> 05:44.853
<i>A dollar here, a dollar there.</i>

05:44.936 --> 05:46.896
<i>I was living in a fantasy.</i>

05:49.440 --> 05:51.025
Did you have a good day at school?

05:51.109 --> 05:53.027
<i>My father was always pissed off.</i>

05:53.111 --> 05:55.321
<i>Pissed that he made such lousy money...</i>

05:55.405 --> 05:58.408
<i>pissed that my kid brother Michael</i>
<i>was in a wheelchair.</i>

05:58.491 --> 06:02.745
<i>He was pissed that there were seven of us</i>
<i>living in such a tiny house.</i>

06:03.162 --> 06:04.873
Tell me about this.

06:05.290 --> 06:07.333
It's a letter from school.

06:07.876 --> 06:10.670
It says you haven't been there in months.

06:11.921 --> 06:13.256
In months!

06:15.049 --> 06:16.509
You're a bum!

06:16.676 --> 06:18.803
Want to grow up to be a bum?

06:20.346 --> 06:24.559
<i>After a while, he was mostly pissed</i>
<i>because I hung around the cabstand.</i>

06:24.642 --> 06:26.644
<i>He knew what went on at that cabstand.</i>

06:26.728 --> 06:31.399
<i>Every once in a while, I'd have to take</i>
<i>a beating. But by then, I didn't care.</i>

06:31.691 --> 06:33.401
<i>The way I saw it...</i>

06:33.735 --> 06:36.404
<i>everybody takes a beating sometime.</i>

06:37.572 --> 06:41.409
- I can't make any more deliveries.
- What? You'll fuck everything up.

06:41.492 --> 06:43.620
My dad says he'll kill me. Look.

06:43.703 --> 06:45.163
Come on with me.

06:45.413 --> 06:47.332
- Is that him, kid?
- No.

06:47.999 --> 06:49.751
- How about him?
- No.

06:51.753 --> 06:53.755
- That's the guy.
- Get him.

06:55.590 --> 06:56.925
Excuse me.

06:58.051 --> 07:00.762
- Scumbag.
- Come here, you piece of shit.

07:08.520 --> 07:10.730
- Know this kid?
- Yeah.

07:10.813 --> 07:12.440
- Know where he lives?
- Yeah.

07:12.524 --> 07:14.859
- You deliver mail to his house?
- Yeah.

07:14.943 --> 07:18.780
From now on, any letter from that school
to his house comes directly here.

07:18.863 --> 07:20.073
- Understand?
- Yeah.

07:20.156 --> 07:22.951
Another letter from that school
goes to that kid's house...

07:23.034 --> 07:25.620
in the fucking oven you'll go, head first.

07:25.703 --> 07:30.083
<i>That was it. No more letters from</i>
<i>truant officers. No letters from school.</i>

07:30.166 --> 07:32.293
<i>In fact, no more letters from anybody.</i>

07:32.377 --> 07:36.089
<i>Finally after a few weeks, my mother</i>
<i>went to the post office to complain.</i>

07:36.548 --> 07:38.258
<i>How could I go to school after that...</i>

07:38.341 --> 07:42.512
<i>and pledge allegiance to the flag</i>
<i>and sit through good government bullshit?</i>

07:45.598 --> 07:48.810
<i>Paulie hated phones.</i>
<i>He wouldn't have one in his house.</i>

07:48.893 --> 07:51.604
Mickey called. Want me to call him back?

07:51.980 --> 07:53.648
All right, make the call.

07:53.731 --> 07:57.443
<i>He got all his calls second hand.</i>
<i>Then you'd have to call the people back...</i>

07:57.527 --> 07:58.611
<i>from an outside phone.</i>

07:58.695 --> 08:01.197
Got a nickel? Get him on the phone.

08:01.948 --> 08:06.703
<i>There were guys, that's all they did</i>
<i>all day, was take care of Paulie's calls.</i>

08:16.337 --> 08:20.717
<i>For a guy who moved all day long,</i>
<i>Paulie didn't talk to six people.</i>

08:20.800 --> 08:23.887
<i>If there was a union problem</i>
<i>or, say, a beef in the numbers...</i>

08:23.970 --> 08:27.515
<i>only the top guys could meet</i>
<i>with Paulie to discuss the problem.</i>

08:27.599 --> 08:30.894
<i>Everything was one-on-one.</i>
<i>Paulie hated conferences.</i>

08:31.644 --> 08:34.147
<i>He didn't want anybody</i>
<i>hearing what he said...</i>

08:34.230 --> 08:37.650
<i>and he didn't want anybody listening</i>
<i>to what he was being told.</i>

08:37.734 --> 08:42.030
<i>Hundreds of guys depended on Paulie,</i>
<i>he got a piece of everything they made.</i>

08:42.113 --> 08:46.534
<i>It was a tribute, like in the old country,</i>
<i>except they were doing it in America.</i>

08:46.618 --> 08:51.164
<i>All they got from Paulie was protection</i>
<i>from other guys looking to rip them off.</i>

08:51.247 --> 08:55.210
<i>That's what it's all about. That's what</i>
<i>the FBI could never understand.</i>

08:55.668 --> 08:57.879
<i>What Paulie and the Organization does...</i>

08:57.962 --> 09:01.925
<i>is offer protection for people</i>
<i>who can't go to the cops. That's it.</i>

09:02.509 --> 09:06.638
<i>That's all it is. They're like</i>
<i>the police department for wiseguys.</i>

09:16.439 --> 09:20.568
<i>People looked at me differently,</i>
<i>and they knew I was with somebody.</i>

09:20.693 --> 09:24.906
<i>I didn't have to wait in line at the bakery</i>
<i>on Sunday mornings for fresh bread.</i>

09:24.989 --> 09:26.449
<i>The owner knew who I was with...</i>

09:26.533 --> 09:30.203
<i>and he'd come from around the counter.</i>
<i>No matter how many were waiting...</i>

09:30.286 --> 09:32.288
<i>I was taken care of first.</i>

09:32.455 --> 09:34.958
<i>Our neighbors didn't park</i>
<i>in our driveway anymore...</i>

09:35.041 --> 09:37.710
<i>even though we didn't have a car. At 13...</i>

09:37.794 --> 09:40.755
<i>I was making more money than most</i>
<i>of the grown-ups around.</i>

09:40.839 --> 09:44.008
<i>I had more money than I could spend.</i>
<i>I had it all.</i>

09:54.143 --> 09:58.898
<i>One day, some neighborhood kids carried</i>
<i>my mother's groceries all the way home.</i>

09:58.982 --> 10:00.400
<i>You know why?</i>

10:01.234 --> 10:03.069
<i>It was out of respect.</i>

10:04.821 --> 10:06.906
Hi, Mom, what do you think?

10:08.533 --> 10:11.244
- Look at my shoes, aren't they great?
- My God.

10:11.786 --> 10:13.413
You look like a gangster.

10:13.496 --> 10:15.248
They shot me. Help!

10:17.750 --> 10:19.586
Henry, shut the door.

10:20.587 --> 10:23.882
<i>That was the first time</i>
<i>I had ever seen anyone shot.</i>

10:24.632 --> 10:26.885
Can't have that in here. Jesus Christ!

10:26.968 --> 10:28.970
I can't have that in this joint.

10:29.053 --> 10:30.847
<i>I remember feeling bad about the guy...</i>

10:30.930 --> 10:34.100
<i>but I also remember feeling</i>
<i>that maybe Tuddy was right.</i>

10:34.392 --> 10:37.103
<i>I knew Paulie didn't want</i>
<i>anybody dying in the building.</i>

10:37.187 --> 10:41.065
You're a real jerk. You wasted
eight fucking aprons on this guy.

10:41.149 --> 10:44.444
What the hell's wrong with you?
I got to toughen this kid up.

11:04.130 --> 11:06.007
<i>It was a glorious time.</i>

11:06.966 --> 11:09.552
<i>And wiseguys were all over the place.</i>

11:10.470 --> 11:13.515
<i>It was before Apalachin</i>
<i>and before Crazy Joe...</i>

11:13.598 --> 11:16.518
<i>decided to take on a boss and start a war.</i>

11:17.185 --> 11:19.312
<i>It was when I met the world.</i>

11:19.395 --> 11:22.148
<i>And it was when I first met</i>
<i>Jimmy Conway.</i>

11:23.358 --> 11:26.819
<i>He couldn't have been more than 28 or 29</i>
<i>at the time...</i>

11:26.903 --> 11:28.905
<i>but he was already a legend.</i>

11:28.988 --> 11:33.076
<i>He'd walk in the door and everybody</i>
<i>who worked the room just went wild.</i>

11:33.159 --> 11:35.828
<i>He'd give the doorman $100</i>
<i>just for opening the door.</i>

11:35.912 --> 11:39.916
<i>He'd give hundreds to the dealers</i>
<i>and the guys who ran the games.</i>

11:39.999 --> 11:43.044
<i>The bartender got $100</i>
<i>just for keeping the ice cubes cold.</i>

11:43.127 --> 11:46.214
The Irishman is here
to take all you guineas' money.

11:49.467 --> 11:52.178
- Want a drink?
- Give me a 7 and 7.

11:59.352 --> 12:02.689
- I'd like you to meet the kid Henry.
- How you doing?

12:05.108 --> 12:07.861
- Thank you.
- Keep them coming.

12:07.944 --> 12:11.030
<i>Jimmy was one of the most</i>
<i>feared guys in the city.</i>

12:11.114 --> 12:12.824
<i>He was first locked up at 11...</i>

12:12.907 --> 12:16.077
<i>and he was doing hits</i>
<i>for mob bosses when he was 16.</i>

12:16.160 --> 12:18.997
<i>See, hits never bothered Jimmy.</i>
<i>It was business.</i>

12:19.414 --> 12:21.583
<i>But what Jimmy really loved to do...</i>

12:21.666 --> 12:23.751
<i>what he really loved to do was steal.</i>

12:23.835 --> 12:26.129
<i>He actually enjoyed it.</i>

12:26.212 --> 12:30.175
<i>Jimmy was the kind of guy who rooted</i>
<i>for the bad guys in the movies.</i>

12:30.884 --> 12:32.635
Give me your wallet.

12:35.638 --> 12:38.808
You might know who we are,
but we know who you are. Understand?

12:38.892 --> 12:41.394
<i>He was one of</i>
<i>the city's biggest hijackers...</i>

12:41.477 --> 12:45.148
<i>of booze, cigarettes, razor blades,</i>
<i>shrimp and lobsters.</i>

12:45.231 --> 12:48.234
<i>Shrimp and lobsters were best.</i>
<i>They went really fast.</i>

12:48.318 --> 12:52.280
<i>Almost all of them were gimmies.</i>
<i>They just gave it up, no problem.</i>

12:52.363 --> 12:54.115
<i>They called him Jimmy the Gent.</i>

12:54.199 --> 12:55.408
Help the lady.

12:55.491 --> 12:57.619
<i>Drivers loved him.</i>
<i>They used to tip him off...</i>

12:57.702 --> 13:01.372
<i>about the really good loads.</i>
<i>Of course, everybody got a piece.</i>

13:01.456 --> 13:03.625
Thanks, I'll be back for the rest later.

13:03.708 --> 13:05.251
Okay, see you later.

13:07.712 --> 13:09.339
Henry, come here.

13:10.256 --> 13:12.342
- Say hello to Tommy.
- How're you doing, Henry?

13:12.425 --> 13:14.511
You're gonna be working together, okay?

13:14.594 --> 13:16.346
Help him. Go ahead.

13:16.721 --> 13:18.890
Jimmy, you got anything good?

13:18.973 --> 13:23.228
<i>And when the cops assigned a whole</i>
<i>army to stop Jimmy, what did he do?</i>

13:23.311 --> 13:24.437
How're you doing?

13:24.521 --> 13:26.356
<i>He made them partners.</i>

13:26.439 --> 13:28.066
I'd complain, but who'd listen?

13:28.525 --> 13:30.068
- One Pall Mall.
- There you go.

13:30.151 --> 13:32.362
- What do you need?
- Two Luckies.

13:32.445 --> 13:34.405
- Here you go, Henry.
- Thanks a lot.

13:34.489 --> 13:35.615
What do you need?

13:35.698 --> 13:38.451
- One Pall Mall.
- One Pall Mall, here you go.

13:38.535 --> 13:40.245
- What are you doing?
- It's all right.

13:40.328 --> 13:43.581
- You have permission from your mother?
- How many cartons you need?

13:43.665 --> 13:46.626
- Where'd you get the cigarettes?
- Get him out of here.

13:46.709 --> 13:48.545
- It's okay.
- It's not okay.

13:48.628 --> 13:51.923
- You don't understand.
- You don't understand. Store's closed.

13:56.761 --> 13:58.638
- Henry got pinched.
- Where?

13:58.721 --> 14:00.598
By the factory, selling cigarettes.

14:00.682 --> 14:04.561
Henry Hill. <i>The People of</i>
<i>the State of New York vs. Henry Hill.</i>

14:04.811 --> 14:07.647
Docket number 704162.

14:09.232 --> 14:10.984
Yes, sir. That's me.

14:13.820 --> 14:16.573
Just stand there. Now stay there.

14:22.996 --> 14:24.706
Counselor, proceed.

14:27.917 --> 14:29.502
Congratulations.

14:29.836 --> 14:31.796
Here's your graduation present.

14:31.880 --> 14:34.924
- What for? I got pinched.
- Everyone does, but you did it right.

14:35.008 --> 14:37.177
You told them nothing,
and they got nothing.

14:37.260 --> 14:40.471
- I thought you'd be mad.
- I'm not mad, I'm proud of you.

14:40.555 --> 14:44.934
You took your first pinch like a man
and learned the two greatest things in life.

14:45.018 --> 14:47.353
- What?
- Look at me.

14:48.104 --> 14:50.231
Never rat on your friends...

14:50.356 --> 14:52.692
and always keep your mouth shut.

14:55.820 --> 14:57.197
Here he is.

14:57.697 --> 14:59.574
You broke your cherry.

15:06.664 --> 15:08.333
Congratulations!

15:42.951 --> 15:46.287
<i>By the time I grew up,</i>
<i>there was $30 billion a year in cargo...</i>

15:46.371 --> 15:48.206
<i>moving through Idlewild Airport...</i>

15:48.289 --> 15:51.417
<i>and believe me,</i>
<i>we tried to steal every bit of it.</i>

15:51.751 --> 15:54.379
<i>See, you gotta understand,</i>
<i>we grew up near the airport.</i>

15:54.462 --> 15:56.089
<i>It belonged to Paulie.</i>

15:56.172 --> 15:58.967
<i>We had friends and relatives</i>
<i>who worked all over the place.</i>

15:59.050 --> 16:02.846
<i>They would tip us off about</i>
<i>what was coming in and moving out.</i>

16:03.263 --> 16:06.140
<i>If any truckers or airlines gave us trouble...</i>

16:06.224 --> 16:10.395
<i>Paulie had the union people scare them</i>
<i>with a strike. It was beautiful.</i>

16:10.478 --> 16:14.357
<i>It was a bigger moneymaker than numbers</i>
<i>and Jimmy was in charge of it all.</i>

16:14.440 --> 16:17.318
<i>Whenever we needed money,</i>
<i>we'd rob the airport.</i>

16:17.402 --> 16:19.904
<i>To us, it was better than Citibank.</i>

16:30.957 --> 16:33.418
You got a phone? Come on!

16:33.501 --> 16:37.255
Two niggers just stole my truck.
Can you believe that shit?

16:42.177 --> 16:43.928
<i>There was Jimmy...</i>

16:44.262 --> 16:45.805
<i>and Tommy and me.</i>

16:45.889 --> 16:47.807
<i>And there was Anthony Stabile.</i>

16:47.891 --> 16:49.475
How're you doing?

16:49.601 --> 16:51.186
<i>Frankie Carbone.</i>

16:53.271 --> 16:56.357
<i>And then there was Mo Black's brother,</i>
<i>Fat Andy.</i>

16:57.442 --> 16:59.444
<i>And his guys, Frankie the Wop.</i>

17:01.446 --> 17:03.281
<i>Freddy No Nose.</i>

17:04.781 --> 17:08.786
<i>And then there was Pete the Killer,</i>
<i>who was Sally Balls'brother.</i>

17:10.954 --> 17:13.040
<i>Then you had Nickey Eyes...</i>

17:14.250 --> 17:16.127
<i>and Mikey Franzese.</i>

17:16.211 --> 17:17.712
That guy, I wanna see him.

17:17.795 --> 17:21.508
<i>Jimmy Two Times, who got that nickname</i>
<i>because he said everything twice.</i>

17:21.590 --> 17:24.219
I'm gonna go get the papers,
get the papers.

17:36.231 --> 17:40.026
What is this? Coats?
Henry, I need suits, not coats.

17:40.527 --> 17:42.070
Suits are coming Thursday.

17:42.153 --> 17:45.156
But it's the middle of summer.
What'll I do with fur coats?

17:45.240 --> 17:47.450
You don't want furs? I'll take them away.

17:47.534 --> 17:51.996
No, I want them. We'll hang them
in the freezer with the meat. How's that?

17:52.080 --> 17:54.749
<i>For us, to live any other way was nuts.</i>

17:55.333 --> 17:59.254
<i>To us, those goody-good people who</i>
<i>worked shitty jobs for bum paychecks...</i>

17:59.337 --> 18:03.424
<i>and took the subway to work every day</i>
<i>and worried about bills, were dead.</i>

18:03.758 --> 18:06.344
<i>They were suckers. They had no balls.</i>

18:06.719 --> 18:09.097
<i>If we wanted something, we just took it.</i>

18:09.180 --> 18:13.726
<i>If anyone complained twice, they got hit</i>
<i>so bad they never complained again.</i>

18:13.810 --> 18:17.355
<i>It was just all routine.</i>
<i>You didn't even think about it.</i>

18:20.108 --> 18:23.027
Frankie, what the fuck does 520
have to do with 469?

18:23.111 --> 18:24.571
I can't believe this guy.

18:24.654 --> 18:28.658
520 ain't even close to 469.
What's that got to do with anything?

18:32.203 --> 18:33.705
Piece of cake. It's all there.

18:33.788 --> 18:37.166
Don't worry about the alarms.
I just gotta find a way to get the key.

18:37.250 --> 18:39.794
- No problem, right?
- I'll take care of it.

18:47.135 --> 18:50.722
- Tell him what you were telling me.
- Too good to be true.

18:51.723 --> 18:55.393
Big score coming from Air France.
Bags of money coming in.

18:56.561 --> 18:59.105
Tourists and American servicemen
change their money...

18:59.189 --> 19:01.232
into French money and send it back here.

19:01.316 --> 19:03.401
- Calm down.
- It's beautiful.

19:03.902 --> 19:07.113
It's totally untraceable. Okay?

19:07.197 --> 19:09.949
The only problem is getting a key,
but I've got a plan.

19:10.033 --> 19:13.494
- Me and Frenchy and this citizen.
- Yeah, he's a piece of work.

19:13.578 --> 19:17.457
If I'm right, there could be
$500,000 coming in, all cash.

19:18.458 --> 19:22.337
The best time is probably over a weekend.
So maybe Saturday night.

19:22.420 --> 19:24.506
There's a Jewish holiday on Monday.

19:24.589 --> 19:27.008
They won't find out until Tuesday.
Beautiful.

19:27.091 --> 19:29.010
What about the security?

19:29.093 --> 19:30.345
Security?

19:30.678 --> 19:33.806
You're looking at it. It's a joke.
I'm the midnight-to-eight man.

19:33.890 --> 19:35.433
I'm the commandant.

19:35.517 --> 19:38.436
He just comes in
like he's picking up lost baggage.

19:38.520 --> 19:41.105
- It's beautiful.
- It won't be a problem at all.

19:41.189 --> 19:42.690
- Good.
- We're on.

19:43.942 --> 19:47.487
What's really funny is
that fucking bank job in Secaucus.

19:47.570 --> 19:49.614
I'm in the middle of the weeds,
lying down.

19:49.697 --> 19:52.158
He says, "What are you doing?"
I said, "I'm resting."

19:52.242 --> 19:55.620
"Here? This ain't no beach or park."
I said, "I'm resting."

19:55.703 --> 19:57.205
I know I'm resting.

19:57.288 --> 20:00.667
He pulls me in, starts asking questions.
You know, this and that.

20:00.750 --> 20:03.795
"What are you going to tell us?"
I said, "My usual. Nothing.

20:03.878 --> 20:08.258
"Why tell you?" The fuck. He says,
"No, you'll tell me something today."

20:08.550 --> 20:10.885
I said, "Okay, go fuck your mother."

20:15.056 --> 20:18.476
You saw the paper, Anthony.
My head was out like this.

20:19.310 --> 20:22.730
Now I'm coming around,
and who do I see in front of me?

20:22.814 --> 20:26.568
This prick again. He says,
"What do you want to tell me now?"

20:26.651 --> 20:30.655
I said, "What are you doing here?
I told you to go fuck your mother."

20:31.614 --> 20:33.783
I thought he was gonna shit.

20:36.160 --> 20:38.913
The fuckers. I wish I was big just once.

20:43.168 --> 20:45.253
Funny. You're really funny.

20:46.462 --> 20:48.506
What do you mean, I'm funny?

20:48.590 --> 20:51.885
It's funny, you know. It's a good story.

20:51.968 --> 20:53.678
You're a funny guy.

20:54.679 --> 20:56.931
You mean the way I talk? What?

20:57.765 --> 21:00.476
It's just, you know. You're just funny.

21:01.561 --> 21:03.980
You know, the way
you tell the story and everything.

21:04.063 --> 21:06.441
Funny how? What's funny about it?

21:07.358 --> 21:09.903
- Tommy, you got it all wrong.
- Anthony.

21:09.986 --> 21:12.655
He's a big boy. He knows what he said.
What did you say?

21:12.739 --> 21:14.032
Funny, how?

21:16.534 --> 21:18.745
Just, you know. You're funny.

21:19.204 --> 21:21.080
Let me understand this.

21:21.331 --> 21:23.374
Maybe I'm a little fucked up.

21:23.458 --> 21:26.836
But, I'm funny, how? Funny like a clown?
I amuse you?

21:27.587 --> 21:30.215
I make you laugh?
I'm here to fucking amuse you?

21:30.298 --> 21:33.009
What do you mean, funny?
How am I funny?

21:36.471 --> 21:38.765
You know, how you tell a story.

21:39.015 --> 21:42.769
No, I don't know. You said it.
How do I know? You said I'm funny.

21:42.977 --> 21:46.397
How the fuck am I funny?
What the fuck is so funny about me?

21:46.523 --> 21:48.316
Tell me what's funny.

21:53.988 --> 21:55.907
Get the fuck out of here, Tommy.

21:55.990 --> 21:59.160
Motherfucker! I almost had him!

22:00.286 --> 22:02.330
You stuttering prick, you!

22:02.413 --> 22:04.374
Frankie, was he shaking?

22:05.416 --> 22:09.254
I wonder about you sometimes, Henry.
You may fold under questioning.

22:13.883 --> 22:14.968
Jesus Christ.

22:15.051 --> 22:18.763
What the fuck is it with you?
I thought I was getting pinched already.

22:18.847 --> 22:22.267
He's hanging on my fucking neck
like a vulture. What do you want?

22:22.350 --> 22:25.603
This guy didn't want to come
and give you the check.

22:26.145 --> 22:27.772
Could you take care of this?

22:27.856 --> 22:30.775
No problem. Tell him to put it
on my tab. Of course.

22:30.859 --> 22:32.819
That's what I want to talk to you about.

22:32.902 --> 22:36.364
It ain't just this one.
It's seven big ones you owe me.

22:36.781 --> 22:40.410
$7,000, that ain't peanuts.
I don't mean to be out of order...

22:40.493 --> 22:42.620
Don't mean to be out of order?

22:42.704 --> 22:44.873
It's good you don't mean
to be out of order.

22:44.956 --> 22:48.668
Embarrassing me in front of my friends,
like I'm a deadbeat.

22:49.043 --> 22:50.795
You know, Sonny, you're a fucking mutt.

22:50.879 --> 22:52.922
You know the money
we spend in this fucking...

22:53.006 --> 22:55.383
- Don't be like that.
- What do you mean?

23:01.931 --> 23:05.226
Do you believe this prick?
You think this is funny?

23:07.812 --> 23:11.900
What the fuck are you looking at?
You fucking moron!

23:12.192 --> 23:14.652
You don't want to bring the check?

23:16.279 --> 23:18.323
Do you believe this prick?

23:21.159 --> 23:23.953
You're supposed
to be doing this stuff, too.

23:24.037 --> 23:25.747
You're a funny guy.

23:26.664 --> 23:28.791
- That's it, Henry.
- No, go back.

23:30.627 --> 23:34.631
You want to laugh? This prick last week
asked me to christen his kid.

23:35.256 --> 23:37.509
I charged him $7,000.

23:40.512 --> 23:42.597
You really are a funny guy.

23:46.351 --> 23:49.646
I'm worried. I'm hearing all kinds
of fucking bad things.

23:49.854 --> 23:51.773
He's treating me like I'm a fucking fag.

23:51.856 --> 23:55.485
I got to go on the lam
in order to get away from this guy.

23:55.568 --> 23:58.655
This ain't right. I can't go here,
I can't go there.

23:58.738 --> 24:02.158
You think you're the only one?
I talk to them, they don't listen.

24:02.242 --> 24:06.246
If you tell him, he'll stop.
I'll wind up being declared an MIA.

24:06.329 --> 24:09.374
They'll find me in the back of a car
somewhere in the weeds.

24:09.457 --> 24:12.126
You've known this Tommy all your life.
Who knows better?

24:12.210 --> 24:13.795
This cocksucker's an arch criminal.

24:13.878 --> 24:17.590
When I leave my house, before I get
to the car I look over both shoulders.

24:17.674 --> 24:20.134
This is no way to live. I'm no fence jumper.

24:20.218 --> 24:22.679
I'm around you all my life,
tell me what I gotta do.

24:22.762 --> 24:25.640
- Whatever I got to do, I'm gonna do.
- What could I do?

24:25.723 --> 24:29.853
If there was something I could do, I would.
I would like to help you out.

24:30.186 --> 24:32.689
Sonny, tell him what we talked about.

24:33.022 --> 24:35.066
- You think it's all right?
- Yeah.

24:37.735 --> 24:41.531
Maybe you could come in with me,
take a piece of this joint. It'd be good.

24:41.614 --> 24:44.659
What are you talking about?
You mean the restaurant?

24:44.742 --> 24:47.579
It's a classy place. Look at the layout.

24:47.662 --> 24:50.790
You've been in there a million times.
You know how it looks.

24:50.874 --> 24:54.711
Tommy taking over this joint
is like putting a silk hat on a pig.

24:54.794 --> 24:57.881
I don't mean no disrespect,
but that's the way it is.

24:57.964 --> 25:01.384
I know you're his friend.
I'm begging you. What can I say?

25:02.093 --> 25:05.054
What am I gonna do?
What do you want from me?

25:05.388 --> 25:08.933
I don't know anything
about the restaurant business. Nothing.

25:09.017 --> 25:12.645
All I know is to sit down and order a meal,
not how to make a restaurant.

25:12.729 --> 25:15.064
Not for you. It's just a place to hang.

25:15.148 --> 25:18.818
The chef is great. The shows are good.
There's a lot of whores coming in.

25:18.902 --> 25:22.071
I'd love to help you, but what do you want
from me? What'll I do?

25:22.155 --> 25:25.491
Tommy's a bad kid, a bad seed.
What am I supposed to do? Shoot him?

25:25.575 --> 25:27.577
That wouldn't be a bad idea.

25:32.582 --> 25:36.961
I'm sorry I said that. I didn't mean it.
I just mean that he's scaring me.

25:37.212 --> 25:39.631
I just need help. Help me, please.

25:40.465 --> 25:42.926
You know anything about
this restaurant business?

25:43.009 --> 25:45.929
He knows everything.
He's there 24 hours a day.

25:46.012 --> 25:48.765
Another fucking few minutes,
he could be a stool.

25:48.848 --> 25:50.475
That's how often he's in there.

25:50.558 --> 25:54.395
You want me to be your partner?
Is that what you're telling me?

25:54.479 --> 25:58.024
What the fuck you think I'm talking about?
Paulie, please. Come on.

25:58.107 --> 26:00.109
It's not even fair.

26:00.401 --> 26:01.945
You don't understand.

26:02.028 --> 26:05.573
You run the joint.
Maybe I'll try to help you, all right.

26:05.657 --> 26:09.827
God bless you, Paulie. I appreciate it.
You've always been fair with me.

26:09.911 --> 26:13.873
<i>Now the guy's got Paulie as a partner.</i>
<i>Any problems, he goes to Paulie.</i>

26:13.957 --> 26:16.125
<i>Trouble with a bill, he can go to Paulie.</i>

26:16.209 --> 26:18.461
<i>Trouble with the cops,</i>
<i>deliveries, Tommy...</i>

26:18.545 --> 26:19.838
<i>he can call Paulie.</i>

26:19.921 --> 26:22.882
<i>Now the guy's gotta come up</i>
<i>with Paulie's money every week...</i>

26:22.966 --> 26:24.133
<i>no matter what.</i>

26:24.217 --> 26:28.346
<i>"Business is bad? Fuck you, pay me.</i>
<i>Had a fire? Fuck you, pay me.</i>

26:28.429 --> 26:31.307
<i>"The place got hit by lightning?</i>
<i>Fuck you, pay me. "</i>

26:31.391 --> 26:33.643
Can I get one of those TVs?

26:33.726 --> 26:35.478
<i>Also, Paulie could do anything.</i>

26:35.562 --> 26:38.690
<i>Especially run up bills on the joint's credit.</i>
<i>And why not?</i>

26:38.773 --> 26:40.817
<i>Nobody's gonna pay for it anyway.</i>

26:40.900 --> 26:42.986
<i>When deliveries are made</i>
<i>at the front door...</i>

26:43.069 --> 26:45.822
<i>you move the stuff out the back</i>
<i>and sell it at a discount.</i>

26:45.905 --> 26:49.200
<i>You take a $200 case of booze</i>
<i>and sell it for $100.</i>

26:49.450 --> 26:51.953
<i>It doesn't matter. It's all profit.</i>

26:53.788 --> 26:56.332
<i>Then finally, when there's nothing left...</i>

26:56.416 --> 26:57.500
Fucking shame.

26:57.584 --> 27:01.796
<i>... when you can't borrow another buck</i>
<i>or buy another case of booze...</i>

27:01.880 --> 27:04.674
<i>you bust the joint out. You light a match.</i>

27:04.757 --> 27:06.342
Do you need help reaching anything?

27:06.426 --> 27:08.845
You look like
you're decorating a Christmas tree.

27:08.928 --> 27:11.181
You don't know what you're doing.

27:13.892 --> 27:15.935
She's from the Five Towns.

27:16.644 --> 27:17.729
Who?

27:18.313 --> 27:21.649
The Jew broad, Diane,
I was telling you I'm going to shag.

27:22.150 --> 27:24.819
I've been trying to bang her
for a fucking month now.

27:24.903 --> 27:27.197
She won't go out with me alone.

27:27.780 --> 27:29.365
- No.
- No, what?

27:30.366 --> 27:32.702
No, what? Who the fuck
asked you anything?

27:32.785 --> 27:34.829
I didn't ask you.
Hear what I'm going to say.

27:34.913 --> 27:36.498
All right, what?

27:37.040 --> 27:38.208
Okay, what.

27:38.416 --> 27:41.085
She don't want to go out
with Italians alone.

27:41.169 --> 27:43.463
She's prejudiced against Italians.

27:43.546 --> 27:46.049
You fucking believe that?
In this day and age?

27:46.132 --> 27:48.718
What the fuck is this world coming to?

27:49.719 --> 27:53.556
I can't believe this. A Jew broad,
prejudiced against Italians.

27:53.640 --> 27:56.935
She won't go out with me alone
unless her girlfriend comes with us.

27:57.018 --> 27:59.145
So you come along,
go out with her girlfriend.

27:59.229 --> 28:01.147
See? I knew it.

28:01.231 --> 28:03.650
You knew what?
What the fuck is wrong with that?

28:03.733 --> 28:05.818
- When is this?
- Tomorrow night.

28:05.902 --> 28:07.529
I can't, I gotta meet Tuddy.

28:07.612 --> 28:10.406
You could meet Tuddy.
You can come early and then still go.

28:10.490 --> 28:12.951
- Why do you always do this?
- Don't give me that shit.

28:13.034 --> 28:15.578
What did I ask you for?
I'm asking you for a favor.

28:15.662 --> 28:17.539
I do a lot of fucking favors for you.

28:17.622 --> 28:20.625
I'm trying to bang this fucking broad.
Help me out.

28:22.377 --> 28:24.796
I don't understand you. She's beautiful!

28:24.879 --> 28:28.049
Her fucking family lives in the Five Towns.
These Jews got money.

28:28.132 --> 28:32.512
Maybe the family owns the whole block.
You may wind up with a big score.

28:33.596 --> 28:35.723
You with your fucking mouth.

28:40.103 --> 28:44.566
<i>I had a meeting with Tuddy at 11:00,</i>
<i>and here I am, a backup guy for Tommy.</i>

28:44.941 --> 28:47.360
How about it?
Did you have enough to eat?

28:47.443 --> 28:50.071
It was delicious. I'm just watching my diet.

28:50.154 --> 28:51.573
Let me watch your figure.

28:51.656 --> 28:53.283
<i>I couldn't wait to get away.</i>

28:53.366 --> 28:55.994
<i>I was ordering the dessert</i>
<i>when they were eating dinner.</i>

28:56.077 --> 28:58.663
<i>When they were having coffee,</i>
<i>I was asking for a check.</i>

28:58.746 --> 28:59.998
<i>I had business.</i>

29:00.081 --> 29:02.625
Have some coffee. It'll wake you up.

29:04.919 --> 29:06.963
- Can we have the check?
- What are you doing?

29:07.046 --> 29:09.257
- I got to go.
- We just got here.

29:09.340 --> 29:11.342
I got that thing. I gotta go.

29:11.551 --> 29:13.720
Wait a couple of minutes.
We'll leave together.

29:13.803 --> 29:17.640
This way we don't go out
like a bunch of hobos, one at a time.

29:18.224 --> 29:20.018
<i>I couldn't stand him.</i>

29:20.310 --> 29:22.604
<i>I thought he was really obnoxious.</i>

29:22.687 --> 29:24.731
<i>He kept fidgeting around.</i>

29:25.732 --> 29:28.651
You don't mind, do you?
That's very annoying.

29:31.196 --> 29:35.450
Good? You might prefer Manischewitz,
but it'd look funny on my table.

29:38.369 --> 29:39.829
- Ready?
- Henry, lighten up.

29:39.913 --> 29:42.165
We just got here. What are you doing?

29:43.166 --> 29:46.628
<i>Before it was time to go home,</i>
<i>he was pushing me into the car...</i>

29:46.711 --> 29:50.048
<i>then pulling me out. It was ridiculous.</i>

29:50.798 --> 29:53.009
<i>Diane and Tommy made us promise...</i>

29:53.092 --> 29:55.094
<i>to meet them again on Friday night.</i>

29:55.178 --> 29:56.387
<i>We agreed.</i>

29:56.471 --> 30:00.225
<i>Of course, when Friday night came around,</i>
<i>Henry stood me up.</i>

30:00.308 --> 30:03.144
I feel terrible. I don't know where he is.

30:03.728 --> 30:06.731
He really liked you, too.
All he did was talk about her.

30:06.814 --> 30:09.359
<i>We were a trio</i>
<i>instead of a double date that night.</i>

30:09.442 --> 30:12.362
He would have called.
I hope it's nothing serious.

30:12.445 --> 30:15.198
<i>But I made Tommy take me</i>
<i>looking for him.</i>

30:19.619 --> 30:21.371
Tommy, what the fuck?

30:21.454 --> 30:24.332
You got some nerve standing me up.

30:24.415 --> 30:25.875
Nobody does that to me.

30:25.959 --> 30:29.671
Who do you think you are,
Frankie Valli or some kind of big shot?

30:30.713 --> 30:33.758
Slow down, I forgot.
I thought it was next week.

30:33.842 --> 30:37.136
It was this Friday and you agreed,
so you're a liar!

30:38.179 --> 30:40.139
We can talk about this. Take it easy.

30:40.223 --> 30:41.724
Talk about it?

30:41.808 --> 30:44.894
Talk to you after what
you just did to me? Forget it.

30:45.478 --> 30:49.190
I thought you would stand me up.
You looked bored. You didn't say anything.

30:49.274 --> 30:50.775
What do you expect?

30:52.569 --> 30:54.571
Let me make it up to you.

30:54.821 --> 30:56.072
I'll think about it.

30:56.155 --> 30:59.784
<i>I remember, she was screaming</i>
<i>on the street, and I mean loud.</i>

30:59.868 --> 31:01.202
<i>But she looked good.</i>

31:01.286 --> 31:04.581
I'll think about it.
But it'll cost you, Hill. A lot.

31:04.664 --> 31:07.375
<i>She had these great eyes</i>
<i>just like Liz Taylor's.</i>

31:07.458 --> 31:09.544
<i>At least that's what I thought.</i>

31:10.920 --> 31:12.088
Hello, Henry.

31:12.172 --> 31:13.590
- You're ready?
- Yeah.

31:13.673 --> 31:14.757
Come on.

31:14.841 --> 31:16.593
- No, wait a minute.
- What?

31:16.843 --> 31:19.721
Quick, you have to cover that cross.
My mother sees that...

31:19.804 --> 31:21.055
Karen.

31:21.598 --> 31:22.682
Mom.

31:22.891 --> 31:25.768
- I'd like you to meet my friend, Henry Hill.
- How do you do?

31:25.852 --> 31:29.355
- Nice to meet you.
- My daughter says that you're half Jewish.

31:30.356 --> 31:32.233
It's just the good half.

31:33.067 --> 31:35.153
- Thank you, sir.
- Bye, see you later, thanks.

31:35.236 --> 31:37.572
What're you doing?
You're leaving your car?

31:37.655 --> 31:39.407
He watches the car for me.

31:39.490 --> 31:42.327
It's easier than leaving it at a garage
and waiting.

31:42.410 --> 31:45.330
It's a lot quicker that way,
you know what I mean?

31:52.086 --> 31:55.798
I like going in this way.
It's better than waiting in line.

32:00.261 --> 32:03.848
How are you doing? What's up?
Here you go.

32:10.146 --> 32:12.190
- How are you doing?
- I'm doing all right.

32:12.273 --> 32:13.483
Good.

32:16.903 --> 32:21.491
Every time I come here,
every time, you two. Don't you work?

33:11.541 --> 33:14.669
Henry, nice to see you. Hi, how are you?

33:14.752 --> 33:16.880
Anthony, right in the front.

33:16.963 --> 33:19.257
Anything you need, just let me know.

33:37.609 --> 33:40.278
Tony, thanks a lot. I appreciate it.

33:40.361 --> 33:42.697
- How are you guys doing?
- How are you?

33:48.286 --> 33:50.914
- You gave them $20 each.
- It's all right.

33:50.997 --> 33:53.500
Henry, this is with Mr. Tony, over there.

33:53.583 --> 33:54.959
- Where?
- Over there.

33:55.043 --> 33:57.045
Thanks a lot, Tony.

34:00.381 --> 34:02.717
- What do you do?
- What?

34:02.800 --> 34:05.386
- What do you do?
- I'm in construction.

34:07.347 --> 34:09.766
They don't feel like you're in construction.

34:09.849 --> 34:11.643
I'm a union delegate.

34:13.061 --> 34:14.646
<i>Now, ladies and gentlemen...</i>

34:14.728 --> 34:19.400
<i>the Copacabana is proud to present</i>
<i>the king of one-liners...</i>

34:19.484 --> 34:21.444
<i>Henny Youngman.</i>

34:27.574 --> 34:31.371
How are you all? I'm glad to be here.
Take my wife, please.

34:33.456 --> 34:35.833
I take my wife everywhere
but she finds her way home.

34:38.503 --> 34:40.922
<i>I said, "Where do you wanna go</i>
<i>for our anniversary?"</i>

34:41.005 --> 34:43.049
<i>She said,</i>
<i>"Somewhere I've never been before."</i>

34:43.132 --> 34:45.426
<i>I said, "Try the kitchen."</i>

34:46.511 --> 34:47.719
<i>Dr. Wellsler is here.</i>

34:47.804 --> 34:50.931
<i>Gave a guy six months to live.</i>
<i>Couldn't pay his bill.</i>

34:51.014 --> 34:53.101
<i>Gave him another six months.</i>

34:55.103 --> 34:56.980
<i>I love this crowd.</i>

35:11.411 --> 35:13.413
<i>Air France made me.</i>

35:13.496 --> 35:17.333
<i>We walked out with $420,000</i>
<i>without using a gun.</i>

35:17.417 --> 35:21.004
<i>And we did the right thing.</i>
<i>We gave Paulie his tribute.</i>

35:25.550 --> 35:27.302
$60,000.

35:27.385 --> 35:29.554
It's going to be a good summer.

35:32.640 --> 35:36.352
I'm proud of you.
That is a lot of money for a kid like you.

35:36.436 --> 35:40.481
Anybody asks you where you got it,
you got it in Vegas playing craps, all right?

35:40.565 --> 35:41.941
All right.

35:43.568 --> 35:44.986
Check, sir.

35:47.113 --> 35:49.908
No. You have to sign for it here.

35:51.618 --> 35:53.244
Should I tip him?

36:01.419 --> 36:03.880
- How are you doing?
- Okay. How are you?

36:05.173 --> 36:08.051
Henry, this is Bruce. Bruce, this is Henry.

36:08.676 --> 36:10.762
Good to meet you.

36:11.679 --> 36:13.723
I'll see you around later.

36:18.436 --> 36:20.396
- Do you know him?
- Yeah.

36:20.480 --> 36:22.315
He lives across the street.

36:47.674 --> 36:52.220
<i>One night, Bobby Vinton sent us</i>
<i>champagne. There was nothing like it.</i>

36:52.512 --> 36:56.391
<i>I didn't think there was</i>
<i>anything strange in any of this.</i>

36:56.474 --> 36:59.435
<i>A 21-year-old kid with such connections.</i>

37:01.729 --> 37:03.648
<i>He was an exciting guy.</i>

37:04.274 --> 37:08.278
<i>He was really nice.</i>
<i>He introduced me to everybody.</i>

37:08.903 --> 37:11.406
<i>Everybody wanted to be nice to him.</i>

37:12.073 --> 37:14.158
<i>He knew how to handle it.</i>

37:22.000 --> 37:24.460
<i>Don't buy wigs that come off</i>
<i>at the wrong time.</i>

37:24.544 --> 37:27.255
<i>Morrie's wigs don't come off!</i>

37:27.338 --> 37:28.631
<i>Even underwater.</i>

37:28.715 --> 37:33.136
<i>And remember, Morrie's wigs</i>
<i>are tested against hurricane winds.</i>

37:33.219 --> 37:37.015
<i>Forget about money. You can afford</i>
<i>a Morrie wig. Priced to fit every budget.</i>

37:37.098 --> 37:38.474
<i>Call me now!</i>

37:39.851 --> 37:42.812
<i>Come in for a personalized fitting.</i>

37:46.191 --> 37:49.194
Come on, Morrie. Jimmy's waiting.
You're past due.

37:49.277 --> 37:51.821
You're a good kid.
We've been good to each other.

37:51.905 --> 37:54.449
But there's something
unreasonable going on here.

37:54.532 --> 37:56.826
Jimmy's being a ball-breaker.

37:56.910 --> 37:58.953
Give him 8-to-5 on Cleveland.

37:59.037 --> 38:02.665
I never had to pay the vigorish
he demands. Am I something special?

38:02.749 --> 38:04.501
What am I, a schmuck on wheels?

38:04.584 --> 38:07.128
You know Jimmy.
You borrowed his money. Pay him.

38:07.212 --> 38:09.464
I didn't agree to three points
above the vig.

38:09.547 --> 38:12.133
What are you going to do?
Fight with Jimmy Conway?

38:12.217 --> 38:14.636
He wants his money.
Give him his money and we'll go.

38:14.719 --> 38:15.803
Fuck him!

38:15.887 --> 38:19.307
Fuck him in the ear!
Fuck him in the other ear!

38:19.390 --> 38:21.184
Did I ever bust his balls? Did I?

38:21.267 --> 38:24.020
I could've dropped a dime a million times.

38:24.103 --> 38:27.357
You're talking crazy. Stop it now, will you?

38:27.440 --> 38:30.735
You got money
for that fucking commercial.

38:30.818 --> 38:33.279
You don't got my money?

38:33.363 --> 38:35.323
Jimmy, he's gonna pay you.

38:35.406 --> 38:38.952
I'll fucking kill you.
Give me the money, cocksucker.

38:39.035 --> 38:40.703
Pay me my money.

38:40.787 --> 38:42.413
He'll pay.

38:43.081 --> 38:46.292
Morrie's. Who's this? He's here.

38:47.252 --> 38:49.379
- Jimmy, I'm sorry.
- You should be sorry.

38:49.462 --> 38:52.757
Don't do it again.
Give me the fucking money!

38:52.841 --> 38:55.885
You hear me? Give me the fucking money.

38:55.969 --> 38:59.681
I'll give you. You've got it, kid.
You've got it, believe me.

38:59.764 --> 39:01.933
Karen, slow down.

39:03.017 --> 39:05.270
Where? Stay there. Don't move.

39:06.229 --> 39:08.565
- What happened?
- It's Karen, Jimmy.

39:08.648 --> 39:11.109
- Money today.
- I'll pay.

39:20.869 --> 39:23.204
What happened?

39:23.872 --> 39:25.665
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

39:25.748 --> 39:27.250
Who did it?

39:27.333 --> 39:31.754
This guy who lives across the street
from me that I've known all my life.

39:36.926 --> 39:39.846
He started to touch me.
He started to grab me.

39:40.054 --> 39:42.724
I told him to stop. He didn't stop.

39:42.807 --> 39:46.686
I hit him back.
And then he got really angry.

39:48.897 --> 39:51.024
He pushed me out of the car.

39:58.740 --> 40:00.783
You sure you're all right?

40:03.828 --> 40:07.540
Why don't you go inside
and get yourself together. Clean up.

40:28.436 --> 40:31.064
What do you want, fucko?
You want something?

40:37.695 --> 40:41.783
I swear on my fucking mother,
if you touch her again, you're dead.

40:43.576 --> 40:44.911
Don't shoot.

41:04.097 --> 41:08.059
- Hide this. Are you all right?
- Yeah.

41:12.188 --> 41:15.108
<i>I know there are women,</i>
<i>like my best friends...</i>

41:15.191 --> 41:17.902
<i>who would have gotten out</i>
<i>the minute their boyfriend...</i>

41:17.986 --> 41:20.905
<i>gave them a gun to hide. But I didn't.</i>

41:21.823 --> 41:24.742
<i>I've got to admit the truth.</i>
<i>It turned me on.</i>

41:31.249 --> 41:32.500
<i>Mazel tov!</i>

42:05.033 --> 42:08.995
Why don't you be like your friend Henry?
He's got a nice girl.

42:09.204 --> 42:12.332
He's settling down now. He's married.

42:12.415 --> 42:14.834
Pretty soon he'll have a nice family.

42:14.918 --> 42:18.505
And you're still bouncing around
from girl to girl.

42:26.429 --> 42:28.765
<i>It was like he had two families.</i>

42:28.973 --> 42:33.186
<i>The first time I was introduced</i>
<i>to all of them at once, it was crazy.</i>

42:33.436 --> 42:36.814
<i>Paulie and his brothers had lots</i>
<i>of sons and nephews.</i>

42:37.190 --> 42:40.109
<i>Almost all of them</i>
<i>were named Peter or Paul.</i>

42:41.569 --> 42:43.154
<i>It was unbelievable.</i>

42:43.238 --> 42:46.616
Meet Paulie Jr., my nephew.
And this is Petey.

42:46.908 --> 42:49.994
<i>There must have been two dozen</i>
<i>Peters and Pauls at the wedding.</i>

42:50.078 --> 42:51.246
This is Marie.

42:51.329 --> 42:54.207
<i>Plus, they were all married</i>
<i>to girls named Marie.</i>

42:54.541 --> 42:57.377
- She looks Italian.
- She is Italian, you're right.

42:57.460 --> 43:00.213
<i>And they named all their daughters Marie.</i>

43:01.047 --> 43:04.843
And this is Pete. No, I mean Paulie.
I get confused myself.

43:05.176 --> 43:09.055
<i>By the time I finished meeting everybody,</i>
<i>I thought I was drunk.</i>

43:13.893 --> 43:15.728
Paulie, you shouldn't have.

43:18.773 --> 43:20.483
Welcome to the family.

43:20.900 --> 43:22.068
Sunday dinner?

43:22.151 --> 43:24.821
So beautiful. I want to cry.

43:25.238 --> 43:28.241
Here's something to help you get started.

43:45.008 --> 43:48.636
- The bag. The bag.
- What? What bag?

43:48.720 --> 43:51.639
The bag with the envelopes in it,
all the money.

43:52.640 --> 43:55.977
Don't worry about that.
Nobody's going to steal that here.

44:26.466 --> 44:27.967
He didn't call?

44:28.468 --> 44:32.138
- He's with his friends.
- What kind of person doesn't call?

44:32.222 --> 44:35.475
He's a grown-up. He doesn't have to call
every five minutes.

44:35.558 --> 44:39.145
If he was such a grown-up
why doesn't he get you two an apartment?

44:39.229 --> 44:42.649
Don't start. Mom, you're the one
who wanted us here.

44:42.774 --> 44:46.402
You're here a month and sometimes
I know he doesn't come home at all.

44:46.486 --> 44:48.404
What kind of people are these?

44:48.488 --> 44:51.407
- What do you want me to do?
- Do? What can you do?

44:51.491 --> 44:54.369
He's not Jewish.
Did you know how these people live?

44:54.452 --> 44:56.162
Did you know what they were like?

44:56.246 --> 44:59.332
Your father never stayed out all night
without calling.

44:59.415 --> 45:02.961
Stay out? Daddy never
went out at all, Ma! Keep out of it.

45:03.044 --> 45:04.963
You don't know how I feel!

45:05.046 --> 45:09.008
How do you feel now? You don't know
where he is or who he's with.

45:09.092 --> 45:11.678
He's with his friends! Dad!

45:11.761 --> 45:13.805
Leave him out of this.
He's suffered enough.

45:13.888 --> 45:16.850
He hasn't digested a decent meal
in six weeks.

45:27.527 --> 45:29.779
Where were you? Why didn't you call?

45:29.863 --> 45:34.534
We were worried to death.
A married man does not stay out like this.

45:36.536 --> 45:39.205
Normal people don't act like this!

45:40.665 --> 45:42.417
What's wrong with you?

45:42.876 --> 45:46.754
You're not normal. She's right.
What's wrong with you?

45:46.838 --> 45:50.133
What kind of person are you?
What is the matter with you?

45:50.633 --> 45:52.844
What kind of people are they?

45:55.555 --> 45:58.266
<i>We weren't married to nine-to-five guys.</i>

45:58.349 --> 46:01.227
<i>But the first time I realized how different...</i>

46:01.311 --> 46:03.688
<i>was when Mickey had a hostess party.</i>

46:04.397 --> 46:07.066
- Karen, where you from?
- Lawrence.

46:07.150 --> 46:11.446
On the Island. It's nice.
I'm from Miami. You ever been there?

46:11.905 --> 46:15.325
It's okay, but it's like you died
and woke up in Jew heaven.

46:15.867 --> 46:18.244
Angie, stop picking at that thing.

46:18.369 --> 46:19.746
I'd like to smack his face.

46:19.829 --> 46:21.664
The red-haired guy, looks like a farmer?

46:21.748 --> 46:23.791
The guy's hands are all over me.

46:23.875 --> 46:28.254
So I told him, "Keep your fucking hands
off me, or I'll cut them off."

46:29.881 --> 46:31.341
She means it.

46:31.424 --> 46:35.094
You don't know how lucky he is.
I just mention this to Vinnie...

46:35.261 --> 46:38.473
How can you mention it?
Vinnie would kill him.

46:38.556 --> 46:42.519
If I don't, he'll kill the miserable bastard,
then Vinnie will be there for life.

46:42.602 --> 46:45.313
You think you got problems.
What about Jeannie's kid?

46:45.396 --> 46:49.234
He was in an argument. A $10 card game.
He pulls out a gun.

46:49.317 --> 46:53.029
The gun goes off. Some kid gets killed.
When the grandmother hears it...

46:53.112 --> 46:57.283
and finds out he's jailed, she has a heart
attack and drops dead right on the spot.

46:57.367 --> 47:01.788
Now Jeannie has a husband and son
in jail and a mother in the funeral parlor.

47:02.622 --> 47:05.458
- Jeannie drinks.
- Maybe she's depressed.

47:05.542 --> 47:07.752
Give me a break. She's drunk.

47:09.212 --> 47:12.632
As soon as something happens,
you make them out to be saints.

47:12.715 --> 47:17.637
<i>They had bad skin and wore too much</i>
<i>makeup. They didn't look very good.</i>

47:17.971 --> 47:20.682
<i>They looked beat-up.</i>
<i>And the stuff they wore...</i>

47:20.765 --> 47:22.725
<i>was thrown together and cheap.</i>

47:22.809 --> 47:25.478
<i>A lot of pantsuits and double-knits.</i>

47:27.397 --> 47:29.190
She spends her life in a nightgown.

47:29.274 --> 47:31.651
The woman is no angel, believe me.

47:31.734 --> 47:34.320
<i>They talked about their rotten kids...</i>

47:34.404 --> 47:37.073
<i>and about beating them</i>
<i>with broom handles and belts.</i>

47:37.157 --> 47:40.160
<i>And that the kids</i>
<i>still didn't pay any attention.</i>

47:40.243 --> 47:42.245
<i>When Henry picked me up, I was dizzy.</i>

47:42.328 --> 47:44.998
I don't know if I could live like that.

47:46.207 --> 47:49.711
God forbid, what would happen
if you had to go to prison?

47:49.919 --> 47:51.254
Karen.

47:51.921 --> 47:54.007
Mickey said that Jeannie's husband...

47:54.090 --> 47:56.426
Do you know why Jeannie's husband
went to the can?

47:56.509 --> 47:59.971
Because of Jeannie.
He wanted to get away from her.

48:00.054 --> 48:04.809
Let me tell you something.
Nobody goes to jail unless they want to.

48:05.143 --> 48:07.145
Unless they make themselves get caught.

48:07.228 --> 48:09.063
They don't have things organized.

48:09.147 --> 48:12.525
I know what I'm doing.
I've got things organized with these guys.

48:12.609 --> 48:17.071
You know who goes to jail? Nigger
stickup men. Know why they get caught?

48:17.155 --> 48:20.158
Because they fall asleep
in the getaway car, Karen.

48:20.492 --> 48:24.120
Come on, don't worry so much, sweetie.
Come here.

48:30.710 --> 48:33.421
<i>After a while, it got to be all normal.</i>

48:34.214 --> 48:36.674
<i>None of it seemed like crime.</i>

48:36.758 --> 48:39.135
<i>It was more like Henry was enterprising...</i>

48:39.219 --> 48:43.014
<i>and that he and the guys made bucks</i>
<i>hustling while other guys...</i>

48:43.097 --> 48:46.100
<i>were sitting on their asses</i>
<i>waiting for handouts.</i>

48:46.893 --> 48:50.939
<i>Our husbands weren't brain surgeons,</i>
<i>they were blue-collar guys.</i>

48:51.022 --> 48:55.610
<i>The only way they could make real extra</i>
<i>money was to go out and cut corners.</i>

48:56.027 --> 48:58.655
Where's the strong box, you varmint?

49:05.036 --> 49:07.413
Don't fucking move! Don't move.

49:16.756 --> 49:19.592
- See you at the diner.
- I'm riding shotgun.

49:19.676 --> 49:22.428
Did you see him give it right over?

49:22.512 --> 49:25.223
Back to the hideout to split up the loot.

49:29.143 --> 49:31.521
<i>We were all so very close.</i>

49:31.604 --> 49:35.483
<i>There were never any outsiders around.</i>
<i>Absolutely never.</i>

49:35.650 --> 49:40.405
<i>Being together all the time made</i>
<i>everything seem all the more normal.</i>

49:40.488 --> 49:41.906
Hello, Mrs. Hill. Police.

49:41.990 --> 49:46.369
I'm Detective Deacy. This is Detective
Silvestri. We have a search warrant.

49:46.452 --> 49:48.538
Would you read and sign it?

49:48.746 --> 49:50.248
- Anywhere?
- Yeah, anywhere.

49:50.331 --> 49:52.959
This'll take a while,
we have to go through everything.

49:53.042 --> 49:56.129
- You boys want some coffee?
- No coffee now, thanks.

49:57.172 --> 50:00.383
- Be careful.
- We'll just go about our business.

50:00.466 --> 50:02.927
<i>There was always a little harassment.</i>

50:03.011 --> 50:05.889
<i>They wanted to talk to Henry</i>
<i>about this or that.</i>

50:05.972 --> 50:09.309
<i>They'd make me sign</i>
<i>their subpoenas or warrants.</i>

50:09.392 --> 50:11.811
<i>But mostly they just wanted a handout.</i>

50:11.895 --> 50:15.315
<i>A few bucks to keep things quiet</i>
<i>no matter what they found.</i>

50:20.570 --> 50:25.492
<i>I always asked if they wanted coffee.</i>
<i>Some wives, like Mickey Conway...</i>

50:25.700 --> 50:28.620
<i>used to curse at them</i>
<i>and spit on the floor.</i>

50:28.703 --> 50:32.373
<i>She used to spit on her own floor.</i>
<i>That never made any sense to me.</i>

50:32.457 --> 50:35.502
<i>It was better to be polite</i>
<i>and call the lawyer.</i>

50:44.636 --> 50:49.182
<i>We always did everything together,</i>
<i>and we always were in the same crowd.</i>

50:49.265 --> 50:53.269
<i>Anniversaries, christenings.</i>
<i>We only went to each other's houses.</i>

50:55.396 --> 50:56.814
<i>The women played cards.</i>

50:56.898 --> 51:01.027
<i>When kids were born, Mickey and Jimmy</i>
<i>were the first at the hospital.</i>

51:01.110 --> 51:04.280
<i>When we went to the Islands</i>
<i>or Vegas for vacation...</i>

51:04.364 --> 51:05.698
<i>we went together.</i>

51:05.782 --> 51:08.868
<i>No outsiders ever. It got to be normal.</i>

51:08.993 --> 51:12.121
<i>It got to where I was proud</i>
<i>that I had the kind of husband...</i>

51:12.205 --> 51:15.959
<i>who was willing to risk his neck</i>
<i>just to get us the little extras.</i>

51:16.835 --> 51:20.129
But I got Mom to watch the babies
tomorrow night.

51:20.213 --> 51:22.131
- Can't do it, Karen.
- Why not?

51:22.215 --> 51:24.884
I just can't. I got something lined up.

51:25.343 --> 51:28.596
But tomorrow's the only night
she can do it.

51:28.680 --> 51:32.267
- Pretty please?
- I can't. What do you want me to do?

51:33.685 --> 51:35.854
- I got to go.
- Wait a minute.

51:37.021 --> 51:39.357
I wanted to go shopping.
Can I get some money?

51:39.440 --> 51:41.192
How much do you need?

51:43.027 --> 51:44.863
- How much?
- That much.

51:49.701 --> 51:52.537
This much. Give me a kiss.

51:56.124 --> 51:57.750
See you later.

52:02.839 --> 52:04.007
All right.

52:36.247 --> 52:38.124
Welcome home, Batts.

52:39.751 --> 52:41.628
Hi, how are you?

52:42.128 --> 52:45.423
Sit down. Have a drink.
Give them all a drink.

52:46.090 --> 52:48.635
And give those Irish hoodlums a drink.

52:48.718 --> 52:50.595
There's only one Irishman here.

52:50.678 --> 52:52.764
It's a celebration, fellas.

52:52.847 --> 52:55.975
- Top of the morning to you.
- It's good to be home.

53:00.271 --> 53:01.940
This is my friend Jimmy.

53:02.023 --> 53:04.692
Henry. It's his joint. This is Lisa.

53:06.069 --> 53:07.779
Tommy. All dressed up.

53:07.862 --> 53:10.907
All grown up and doing the town.
Look at this.

53:10.990 --> 53:13.785
Forgot you were having a party
for this mug.

53:14.494 --> 53:16.120
Come here.

53:16.204 --> 53:18.581
I'll say hello. Billy, how are you?

53:18.665 --> 53:21.543
Get over here.
I haven't seen you in six years.

53:21.626 --> 53:24.754
Jesus Christ Almighty. You look terrific.

53:25.421 --> 53:26.798
Watch the suit.

53:27.298 --> 53:30.468
You little prick. I've known you all my life.

53:30.969 --> 53:34.889
- Don't get too big on me.
- Just don't bust my balls.

53:34.973 --> 53:39.018
If I was gonna break your balls,
I'd say, "Go get your shine box."

53:40.728 --> 53:43.022
This kid was great.

53:43.106 --> 53:45.316
They used to call him "Spitshine Tommy."

53:45.400 --> 53:49.529
He'd make your shoes look like
fucking mirrors. Excuse my language.

53:49.612 --> 53:53.616
He was terrific. He was the best.
He made a lot of money, too.

53:54.951 --> 53:56.578
No more shines, Billy.

53:57.162 --> 53:58.663
- What?
- I said no more shines.

53:58.746 --> 54:01.624
You've been away a long time.
They didn't tell you.

54:01.708 --> 54:03.835
I don't shine shoes anymore.

54:04.252 --> 54:08.339
Relax. What's got into you?
I'm breaking your balls a little, that's all.

54:08.423 --> 54:09.841
I'm only kidding with you.

54:09.924 --> 54:13.344
Sometimes you don't sound like it.
There's a lot of people around.

54:13.428 --> 54:15.638
I'm only kidding. We're having a party.

54:15.722 --> 54:19.517
I haven't seen you in a long time
and you get fucking fresh.

54:19.601 --> 54:21.644
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to offend you.

54:21.728 --> 54:24.105
I'm sorry, too. It's okay. No problem.

54:28.693 --> 54:30.862
Now go home and get your fucking
shine box.

54:30.945 --> 54:32.572
Motherfucking mutt!

54:32.655 --> 54:35.074
You fucking piece of shit!

54:35.700 --> 54:37.535
Come on, come on!

54:38.661 --> 54:41.498
He bought his fucking button!
That fake old tough guy!

54:41.581 --> 54:43.958
You bought your fucking button!

54:44.042 --> 54:46.419
- Don't get nervous.
- You motherfucker!

54:46.503 --> 54:49.297
Keep that motherfucker here!
Keep him here.

54:50.840 --> 54:53.051
Come on, you fucking feel strong?

54:53.134 --> 54:56.346
Sorry. Tommy gets a little loaded.
He doesn't mean any disrespect.

54:56.429 --> 54:58.973
He doesn't mean any disrespect?
Are you nuts?

54:59.057 --> 55:02.602
Teach this kid a little fucking manners.
What's right is right.

55:02.685 --> 55:05.230
- You understand what I'm saying?
- It's all right.

55:05.313 --> 55:09.734
We're hugging and kissing over here
and then he acts like a fucking jerk.

55:11.653 --> 55:14.572
You insulted him a little bit.
You got a little out of order.

55:14.656 --> 55:17.033
- I didn't.
- You insulted him a little.

55:17.116 --> 55:20.411
- I didn't insult anybody. Give us a drink.
- Okay.

55:20.829 --> 55:23.122
Let's have some drinks.
Drinks on the house.

55:23.206 --> 55:25.291
No, have the drink with me.

55:26.501 --> 55:28.461
The drinks are on the house.

55:30.213 --> 55:33.258
I fucked kids like that in the can.
In the ass.

55:33.591 --> 55:35.593
Fucking break up my party.

55:42.767 --> 55:45.687
You've been away for six years.
It's different now.

55:45.770 --> 55:48.106
I did my fucking time, Jimmy.

55:48.940 --> 55:53.194
I came home and I want what I got to get.
I got mouths to feed.

55:53.278 --> 55:55.947
- You're gonna get it.
- You understand?

55:58.700 --> 56:00.451
Get the door!

56:15.300 --> 56:17.760
Let me shoot him
in his big, fucking mouth!

56:17.844 --> 56:19.429
Let's shoot him.

56:37.322 --> 56:39.365
Fucking mutt dented my shoes.

56:39.449 --> 56:42.160
His whole crew is going to be
looking for him.

56:44.078 --> 56:48.875
This is bad. What do we do with him?
We can't just dump him on the street.

56:48.958 --> 56:52.670
I know a place upstate.
They'll never find him. More tablecloths.

56:52.754 --> 56:55.381
I didn't want to get blood on your floor.

56:59.177 --> 57:00.929
Go open your trunk.

57:05.225 --> 57:06.976
We'll get a shovel at my mother's house.

57:16.361 --> 57:20.365
She has a shovel here somewhere.
Quiet, I don't want to wake her up.

57:22.158 --> 57:24.744
Look who's here.

57:25.995 --> 57:27.997
What did you do? What happened?

57:28.081 --> 57:30.708
I hit something on the road.
Jimmy will tell you.

57:30.792 --> 57:33.002
What happened to him?

57:34.045 --> 57:37.966
I haven't seen you in so long.
What happened to him?

57:38.049 --> 57:40.009
You, too. How are you?

57:40.093 --> 57:41.386
Why are you up so late?

57:41.469 --> 57:45.890
He came in. You came in.
I'm so happy to see him.

57:45.974 --> 57:49.894
Go inside. Make yourselves comfortable.
I'll make you something to eat.

57:49.978 --> 57:52.814
- Go to sleep. We're leaving.
- I can't. Not while he's home.

57:52.897 --> 57:55.275
I haven't seen him in so long.
I want to see him.

57:55.358 --> 57:56.693
You go inside.

57:56.776 --> 57:58.153
This stuff is like lead.

57:58.236 --> 58:01.406
Tell me, where you been?
I haven't seen you.

58:01.489 --> 58:04.284
You haven't called. Where have you been?

58:04.367 --> 58:07.370
- I been working nights.
- And?

58:07.453 --> 58:09.330
And tonight we were out late.

58:09.414 --> 58:12.917
We took a ride out to the country
and hit a deer.

58:13.001 --> 58:16.045
That's where all the blood is from.
Jimmy told you.

58:16.671 --> 58:19.924
It reminds me, I need this knife.
I'm taking this, okay?

58:20.008 --> 58:21.926
- Okay.
- Just for a while.

58:22.010 --> 58:23.511
The poor thing.

58:23.595 --> 58:27.432
We hit the deer and his paw...
What do you call it?

58:27.515 --> 58:29.225
The paw.

58:29.309 --> 58:31.811
- The hoof.
- Got caught in the grill.

58:31.895 --> 58:33.813
I got to hack it off.

58:33.897 --> 58:36.274
Ma, it's a sin to leave it there.

58:36.357 --> 58:38.234
I'll bring the knife back.

58:38.693 --> 58:40.570
- Delicious.
- Thank you.

58:40.778 --> 58:43.031
Why don't you get yourself a nice girl?

58:43.114 --> 58:45.033
I do, almost every night.

58:45.116 --> 58:47.744
But get yourself a girl
so you could settle down.

58:47.827 --> 58:52.790
I do, every night. Then I'm free.
I love you, I want to be with you.

58:52.874 --> 58:54.292
Settle down.

58:56.169 --> 58:57.879
How's your friend Henry?

58:57.962 --> 59:00.423
What's the matter? You don't talk much.

59:00.507 --> 59:02.342
Talk. What are you quiet for?

59:02.425 --> 59:04.969
You don't eat much, you don't talk much.

59:05.053 --> 59:07.597
- I'm just listening.
- Something wrong?

59:07.680 --> 59:11.267
When we were kids,
the <i>compares</i> used to visit each other.

59:11.476 --> 59:16.231
There was this man. He would never talk.
He'd just sit there all night, not a word.

59:16.648 --> 59:20.944
They say to him, "What's the matter?
Don't you say anything?"

59:21.528 --> 59:25.240
He says, "What am I going to say,
that my wife two-times me?"

59:25.782 --> 59:29.118
So she says, "Shut up!
You're always talking."

59:30.995 --> 59:33.581
But in Italian, it sounds much nicer.

59:33.665 --> 59:35.291
<i>- Cornuto contento.</i>
- That's it.

59:35.375 --> 59:39.003
- What does that mean?
- It means he's content to be a jerk.

59:39.587 --> 59:42.131
He doesn't care who knows it.

59:42.465 --> 59:45.093
- Did Tommy tell you about my painting?
- No.

59:46.094 --> 59:47.595
Look at this.

59:47.887 --> 59:49.180
It's beautiful.

59:49.264 --> 59:52.392
I like it. One dog goes one way
and the other goes the other.

59:52.475 --> 59:54.978
One's facing east, the other west.
So what?

59:55.061 --> 59:58.565
He's saying, "What do you want from me?"
The guy's got nice white hair.

59:58.648 --> 01:00:00.900
Beautiful. The dog looks the same.

01:00:00.984 --> 01:00:02.986
Looks like somebody we know.

01:00:04.737 --> 01:00:06.865
Without the beard. It's him.

01:00:09.450 --> 01:00:10.702
It's him.

01:00:20.211 --> 01:00:21.629
What the fuck is that?

01:00:21.713 --> 01:00:24.382
<i>For most of the guys,</i>
<i>killings were accepted.</i>

01:00:24.465 --> 01:00:27.260
<i>Murder was the only way</i>
<i>everybody stayed in line.</i>

01:00:27.343 --> 01:00:30.680
<i>You got out of line, you got whacked.</i>
<i>Everybody knew the rules.</i>

01:00:30.763 --> 01:00:34.309
<i>Sometimes, even if people didn't</i>
<i>get out of line, they got whacked.</i>

01:00:34.392 --> 01:00:38.897
<i>Hits became a habit. Guys would get</i>
<i>into arguments over nothing.</i>

01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:41.274
<i>Before you knew it, one was dead.</i>

01:00:41.357 --> 01:00:43.651
<i>They were shooting each other</i>
<i>all the time.</i>

01:00:43.735 --> 01:00:47.322
<i>Shooting people was a normal thing.</i>
<i>It was no big deal.</i>

01:00:48.865 --> 01:00:51.826
<i>We had a serious problem with Billy Batts.</i>

01:00:51.910 --> 01:00:56.080
<i>This was really a touchy thing.</i>
<i>Tommy killed a made guy.</i>

01:00:56.164 --> 01:00:59.918
<i>Batts was part of the Gambino crew</i>
<i>and was considered untouchable.</i>

01:01:00.502 --> 01:01:04.047
<i>Before you touched a made guy,</i>
<i>you had to have a good reason.</i>

01:01:04.130 --> 01:01:06.966
<i>You had to have a sit-down</i>
<i>and you'd better get an okay...</i>

01:01:07.050 --> 01:01:09.385
<i>or you'd be the one who got whacked.</i>

01:01:21.606 --> 01:01:23.525
<i>Saturday night was for wives...</i>

01:01:23.608 --> 01:01:26.778
<i>but Friday night at the Copa</i>
<i>was for the girlfriends.</i>

01:01:28.571 --> 01:01:30.907
Last week, we saw Sammy Davis, Jr.

01:01:30.990 --> 01:01:33.993
You got to see this show.
What a performer.

01:01:34.077 --> 01:01:37.664
He does these impersonations.
You'd think it was the real people.

01:01:37.747 --> 01:01:41.876
It's unbelievable. You could see
how a white girl could fall for him.

01:01:42.210 --> 01:01:43.294
What?

01:01:43.920 --> 01:01:48.424
Not me. But you could see how
some girls could. Like that Swedish girl.

01:01:48.842 --> 01:01:50.802
So you condone that stuff.

01:01:50.885 --> 01:01:52.262
Take it easy.

01:01:53.930 --> 01:01:56.891
I don't want to be kissing
Nat King Cole over here.

01:01:56.975 --> 01:01:58.935
No, I'm not talking about me.

01:02:00.311 --> 01:02:02.272
But, you know, he's got personality.

01:02:02.355 --> 01:02:03.857
Personality?

01:02:05.275 --> 01:02:08.361
He's talented.
I understand what you're saying.

01:02:08.444 --> 01:02:11.906
But watch what you say.
People get the wrong impression.

01:02:11.990 --> 01:02:14.450
I just said he was talented,
you're unbelievable.

01:02:14.534 --> 01:02:17.120
Just leave it alone now,
I understand what you said.

01:02:17.203 --> 01:02:19.289
He's talented. Leave it at that.

01:03:57.887 --> 01:04:00.139
No? Not even Uncle Paulie?

01:04:16.739 --> 01:04:19.075
What did you hear about that thing?

01:04:19.742 --> 01:04:22.745
- The Brooklyn thing?
- No, the guy from downtown.

01:04:23.413 --> 01:04:26.583
- The guy from where Christie lived?
- No.

01:04:27.750 --> 01:04:30.962
The guy who disappeared,
the one they made the beef on.

01:04:31.713 --> 01:04:33.715
- Know the guy I mean?
- Yeah.

01:04:33.798 --> 01:04:37.927
His name was Batts. His people
are driving everyone crazy looking for him.

01:04:38.011 --> 01:04:39.804
Nobody knows what happened to him.

01:04:39.888 --> 01:04:43.975
He came into the joint that night
and then just disappeared. That was it.

01:04:45.810 --> 01:04:49.939
All right. Keep your eyes open.
They're busting my balls over it.

01:04:50.440 --> 01:04:52.442
- All right?
- Yeah.

01:04:54.944 --> 01:04:57.071
Okay, everybody, let's eat.

01:05:03.286 --> 01:05:04.913
I want my money.

01:05:05.997 --> 01:05:07.373
He owes it.

01:05:16.257 --> 01:05:19.135
You know that thing
we took care of upstate?

01:05:19.219 --> 01:05:22.680
- Paulie was talking about that.
- Got to get it out of there.

01:05:23.223 --> 01:05:25.892
They just sold the property
to make condominiums.

01:05:25.975 --> 01:05:29.646
- It's been six months.
- We got to get it out of there right away.

01:05:42.116 --> 01:05:46.496
Henry, hurry up. My mother's making
fried peppers and sausage for us.

01:05:50.083 --> 01:05:52.377
- Here's an arm.
- Very funny, guys.

01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:53.962
Here's a leg.

01:05:54.045 --> 01:05:55.505
Here's a wing.

01:05:56.256 --> 01:06:00.760
What do you like, the leg or the wing?
Or you still go for the hearts and lungs?

01:06:01.970 --> 01:06:03.680
Oh, that's so bad.

01:06:10.520 --> 01:06:12.355
What happened to the car?

01:06:12.856 --> 01:06:14.566
I hit a skunk, all right?

01:06:14.649 --> 01:06:16.401
Go with your mother.

01:06:17.443 --> 01:06:19.279
It's disgusting, Henry.

01:06:23.199 --> 01:06:26.286
<i>I set up Janice in an apartment</i>
<i>around the corner from The Suite.</i>

01:06:26.369 --> 01:06:29.205
<i>That way I was able to stay over</i>
<i>a couple of nights a week.</i>

01:06:29.289 --> 01:06:30.582
This is my new antique lamp.

01:06:30.665 --> 01:06:33.835
<i>Karen was home with the kids.</i>
<i>She never asked questions.</i>

01:06:33.918 --> 01:06:35.837
The furniture's all Maurice Valencia.

01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:37.589
Looks like Roma.

01:06:37.672 --> 01:06:39.966
This is all silk. This is from Siam.

01:06:41.968 --> 01:06:43.720
Come see my bedroom.

01:06:44.470 --> 01:06:48.308
- Tommy, will you take him?
- I'll eat this fucking dog tonight.

01:06:52.270 --> 01:06:54.397
Love that crystal ball or what?

01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:58.902
This is where we spend most of our time.

01:07:00.695 --> 01:07:02.989
I love the floral arrangements.

01:07:04.991 --> 01:07:06.075
French.

01:07:06.159 --> 01:07:10.163
<i>Janice and I were having so much fun,</i>
<i>she started screwing up at work.</i>

01:07:10.246 --> 01:07:12.790
<i>I had to straighten out her boss a little bit.</i>

01:07:12.874 --> 01:07:16.544
Janice can do what she wants to do.
Got it?

01:07:16.628 --> 01:07:21.007
Just try to run. Hang up once more,
and you'll deal with me.

01:07:26.596 --> 01:07:28.806
Come on, get off of her.

01:07:29.140 --> 01:07:30.850
You're an animal.

01:07:43.780 --> 01:07:47.575
Spider, on your way over here,
bring me a Cutty and water.

01:07:49.994 --> 01:07:52.330
- Did you guys eat?
- I'm starving.

01:07:53.790 --> 01:07:56.125
- I'll play these.
- You'll play those?

01:07:56.209 --> 01:07:58.294
Do I stutter? I play those.

01:08:02.131 --> 01:08:04.092
What am I? A mirage?

01:08:04.342 --> 01:08:07.053
Where's my fucking drink?
I asked you for a drink.

01:08:07.136 --> 01:08:09.889
- You wanted a drink?
- I asked you for one.

01:08:09.973 --> 01:08:12.892
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

01:08:13.685 --> 01:08:15.687
Am I on a pay-no-mind list?

01:08:15.770 --> 01:08:20.066
No, I heard someone say "Spider, Spider."

01:08:20.149 --> 01:08:23.528
- I thought it was Henry.
- You're a mumbling, stuttering little fuck.

01:08:23.611 --> 01:08:25.779
I thought you said, "I'm all right, Spider."

01:08:25.863 --> 01:08:27.615
You ain't all right.

01:08:27.698 --> 01:08:29.951
No, I thought you said you were all right.

01:08:30.033 --> 01:08:32.953
I am all right! You ain't, you prick.

01:08:35.081 --> 01:08:38.251
You've been doing this all fucking night
to me, you motherfucker!

01:08:38.334 --> 01:08:40.587
He wants a drink now? I'll bring it.

01:08:40.670 --> 01:08:43.381
Go get me a fucking drink!
Move it, you little prick.

01:08:43.464 --> 01:08:46.050
You walk like fucking Stepin Fetchit.

01:08:46.301 --> 01:08:48.136
For everybody else you run.

01:08:48.219 --> 01:08:51.890
Run for me, you prick!
Dance, dance the fucking drink back here!

01:08:52.140 --> 01:08:53.975
What's that movie that Bogart made?

01:08:54.058 --> 01:08:56.769
- Where he played a cowboy.
<i>- The Oklahoma Kid.</i>

01:08:56.853 --> 01:09:00.982
<i>- Shane?</i>
- Oklahoma Kid, that's me!

01:09:01.064 --> 01:09:03.734
You fucking varmint. Dance!

01:09:03.818 --> 01:09:05.819
Yahoo, you motherfucker!

01:09:06.321 --> 01:09:08.490
Round up those fucking wagons.

01:09:14.578 --> 01:09:16.206
Now he's moving.

01:09:17.165 --> 01:09:19.834
- Henry, what happened?
- You shot him in the foot, Tommy.

01:09:19.917 --> 01:09:24.255
He's fucking fine. So he got shot
in the foot. What is it? A big fucking deal?

01:09:24.339 --> 01:09:26.883
- Get a towel.
- Nice fucking game.

01:09:28.384 --> 01:09:33.139
Take him to Ben Casey, the little prick.
Let him crawl like he crawls for the drinks.

01:09:33.680 --> 01:09:36.350
Take him to the doctor down the street.

01:09:36.768 --> 01:09:38.560
Bones are all shattered.

01:09:38.685 --> 01:09:40.522
Don't get me upset, now.

01:09:40.604 --> 01:09:44.274
Don't make a big fucking thing out of it,
Spider, you little prick.

01:09:44.359 --> 01:09:47.111
You trying to make me think
what the fuck I did here.

01:09:47.194 --> 01:09:49.072
It was an accident.

01:09:49.404 --> 01:09:51.698
- Little fucking actor.
- I got a great hand here.

01:09:51.783 --> 01:09:53.243
- You in or out?
- Yeah, I'm in.

01:09:53.326 --> 01:09:55.245
- $800.
- $800?

01:09:55.995 --> 01:09:59.624
You haven't been home in two weeks.
You're not going out tonight!

01:10:00.124 --> 01:10:03.294
Karen, will you grow up! Stop!
I'm still gonna go out!

01:10:03.378 --> 01:10:05.380
Not without your car keys, you're not.

01:10:05.463 --> 01:10:07.549
Are you nuts? What's your problem?

01:10:07.632 --> 01:10:09.843
Yes, I'm nuts. Something's going on.

01:10:10.051 --> 01:10:12.971
- Stop with that. Enough! Stop with that.
- No!

01:10:13.096 --> 01:10:16.808
I'm telling you, I look in your face
and I know that you're lying!

01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:21.271
- Get out! Get out!
- Shut up.

01:10:21.396 --> 01:10:22.605
Get out of my life!

01:10:22.689 --> 01:10:25.733
You're fucked in the head, Karen.
This is all in your mind.

01:10:25.817 --> 01:10:28.236
- You're a lousy bastard!
- You got a problem.

01:10:28.319 --> 01:10:32.157
Go ahead, go to your ready-made whores.
That's all you're good for!

01:10:32.407 --> 01:10:35.869
Get out of my life! I can't stand you!

01:10:46.629 --> 01:10:48.423
Spider, what's your rush?

01:10:51.009 --> 01:10:53.136
- Here you go.
- Thank you, Spider.

01:10:53.219 --> 01:10:57.432
Spider, that fucking bandage on your foot
is bigger than your fucking head.

01:10:59.434 --> 01:11:03.271
Next thing you know, he's gonna be
coming in one of these fucking walkers.

01:11:03.354 --> 01:11:05.231
Even though you got that, you can dance?

01:11:05.315 --> 01:11:09.903
Give us a couple of fucking steps, Spider.
You fucking bullshitter, you.

01:11:10.153 --> 01:11:12.447
Tell the truth.
You're looking for sympathy?

01:11:12.530 --> 01:11:14.908
Why don't you go fuck yourself, Tommy?

01:11:19.454 --> 01:11:22.081
I didn't fucking hear right.
Can't believe what I heard.

01:11:22.165 --> 01:11:24.667
Spider, here. This is for you. Attaboy.

01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:28.505
I got respect for this kid.
He's got a lot of fucking balls.

01:11:28.588 --> 01:11:31.216
Good for you.
Don't take no shit off nobody.

01:11:31.466 --> 01:11:35.094
He shoots him in the foot,
he tells him to go fuck himself.

01:11:36.638 --> 01:11:40.016
Are you gonna let this fucking punk
get away with that?

01:11:40.099 --> 01:11:42.810
What's the matter?
What's the world coming to?

01:11:46.356 --> 01:11:49.484
That's what the fucking world
is coming to. How do you like that?

01:11:49.567 --> 01:11:52.904
- How's that, all right?
- What's the fucking matter with you?

01:11:52.987 --> 01:11:54.989
What are you, stupid or what?

01:11:55.073 --> 01:11:58.243
Tommy, I'm kidding with you.
Are you a fucking sick maniac?

01:11:58.326 --> 01:12:01.496
How do I know if you're kidding?
You're breaking my fucking balls?

01:12:01.579 --> 01:12:04.249
I'm fucking kidding with you,
you fucking shoot the guy?

01:12:04.332 --> 01:12:05.542
He's dead.

01:12:07.168 --> 01:12:09.587
Good shot. I'm a lucky man. Good shot.

01:12:09.671 --> 01:12:11.089
You can't miss at this distance.

01:12:11.172 --> 01:12:13.132
You got a problem
with what I did, Anthony?

01:12:13.216 --> 01:12:14.342
No.

01:12:14.425 --> 01:12:18.221
Fucking rat. His whole family's all rats.
He would've grown up to be a rat.

01:12:18.304 --> 01:12:20.557
Stupid bastard! I can't fucking believe you.

01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:24.519
Now you're going to dig the hole.
I got no fucking lime.

01:12:25.186 --> 01:12:28.982
I'll dig the hole. I don't give a fuck.
Is it the first hole I dug?

01:12:29.190 --> 01:12:31.901
I'll dig the fucking hole.
Where are the shovels?

01:12:32.986 --> 01:12:34.529
<i>- Hello.</i>
- Hello?

01:12:34.737 --> 01:12:37.282
This is Karen Hill. I wanna talk to you.

01:12:38.366 --> 01:12:41.202
Hello? Don't hang up on me!

01:12:41.286 --> 01:12:43.163
<i>I want to talk to you!</i>

01:12:43.413 --> 01:12:46.249
<i>You keep away from my husband,</i>
<i>you hear me?</i>

01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:50.003
<i>Hello? Open the door!</i>

01:12:51.880 --> 01:12:53.298
Answer me!

01:12:53.756 --> 01:12:56.301
I'm gonna tell everyone
who walks in this building...

01:12:56.384 --> 01:12:59.179
that in 2R, Rossi,
you are nothing but a whore!

01:12:59.262 --> 01:13:00.972
Is this the superintendent?

01:13:01.055 --> 01:13:03.600
Yes, I want you to know, sir,
that you have a whore...

01:13:03.683 --> 01:13:05.226
<i>living in 2R!</i>

01:13:05.351 --> 01:13:08.438
Rossi, Janice Rossi. Do you hear me?

01:13:08.897 --> 01:13:10.482
<i>He's my husband!</i>

01:13:10.565 --> 01:13:13.276
<i>Get your own goddamn man!</i>

01:13:14.527 --> 01:13:16.070
Wake up, Henry.

01:13:29.459 --> 01:13:31.211
What are you doing?

01:13:33.796 --> 01:13:36.758
- Karen, are you crazy?
- I am crazy.

01:13:38.051 --> 01:13:40.637
I'm crazy enough to kill both of you.

01:13:43.556 --> 01:13:45.308
Karen, take it easy.

01:13:48.812 --> 01:13:50.772
- Okay?
- Do you love her?

01:13:52.357 --> 01:13:53.566
Do you?

01:13:54.609 --> 01:13:56.653
- Do you?
- Karen...

01:13:58.947 --> 01:14:01.366
I love you. You know I love you.

01:14:02.534 --> 01:14:04.285
You don't.

01:14:05.787 --> 01:14:07.497
No, you don't.

01:14:08.122 --> 01:14:10.834
Please, be careful. Baby, don't.

01:14:11.626 --> 01:14:15.004
<i>But still I couldn't hurt him.</i>
<i>How could I hurt him?</i>

01:14:15.088 --> 01:14:17.799
<i>I couldn't even bring myself to leave him.</i>

01:14:17.966 --> 01:14:19.467
<i>The truth was...</i>

01:14:19.551 --> 01:14:21.845
<i>that no matter how bad I felt...</i>

01:14:22.595 --> 01:14:25.056
<i>I was still very attracted to him.</i>

01:14:26.266 --> 01:14:28.643
<i>Why should I give him to someone else?</i>

01:14:28.726 --> 01:14:30.603
<i>Why should she win?</i>

01:14:34.315 --> 01:14:36.151
Just put it down.

01:14:37.318 --> 01:14:39.779
You know I love you, don't you?

01:14:39.988 --> 01:14:42.073
You're all I want, Karen.

01:14:43.491 --> 01:14:45.702
Please put the gun down, Karen.

01:14:46.619 --> 01:14:49.247
Baby, come on.

01:15:03.178 --> 01:15:05.555
What are you, fucking crazy, Karen?

01:15:06.931 --> 01:15:09.809
I got enough to worry about
getting whacked on the street!

01:15:09.893 --> 01:15:13.563
I got to fucking come home for this?

01:15:14.105 --> 01:15:16.149
I should fucking kill you!

01:15:17.400 --> 01:15:19.235
How does it feel?

01:15:20.278 --> 01:15:22.238
How does it feel, Karen?

01:15:38.880 --> 01:15:40.798
I'm sorry!

01:15:47.764 --> 01:15:49.766
Hi, Jimmy! How are you?

01:15:50.642 --> 01:15:53.728
- Looking good.
- Thank you. Good to see you.

01:15:53.812 --> 01:15:56.356
- Hi, Paulie!
- Hi, honey. How are you?

01:15:56.439 --> 01:15:57.524
Good.

01:15:57.607 --> 01:16:00.318
- Why don't you go get cigarettes, okay?
- Sure.

01:16:01.152 --> 01:16:03.696
- Any of you need anything?
- I'm all right.

01:16:03.988 --> 01:16:06.908
- Want anything to drink? A beer?
- No.

01:16:06.991 --> 01:16:09.577
- Chinese food?
- No, come on, sit down.

01:16:16.376 --> 01:16:18.336
Karen came to the house.

01:16:19.045 --> 01:16:19.712
She's very upset.

01:16:20.213 --> 01:16:22.632
This is no good.
You gotta straighten this thing out.

01:16:22.715 --> 01:16:26.010
We got to have calm now. We don't know
what the hell she's gonna do.

01:16:26.094 --> 01:16:28.513
She's getting all hysterical.
She gets very excited.

01:16:28.596 --> 01:16:32.517
She's wild. And you got to take it easy.
You got children.

01:16:33.268 --> 01:16:36.813
I'm not saying you gotta go back to her
this minute, but you gotta go back.

01:16:36.896 --> 01:16:39.440
It's the only way.
You gotta keep up appearances.

01:16:39.524 --> 01:16:42.068
The two of them come over every day,
commiserating.

01:16:42.152 --> 01:16:44.112
I can't have it.

01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:47.699
I can't do it, Henry.

01:16:47.782 --> 01:16:50.910
Nobody says that you can't do
what you wanna do.

01:16:50.994 --> 01:16:53.746
We all know that. I mean, this is what it is.

01:16:53.830 --> 01:16:56.666
We know what it is.
You have to do the right thing.

01:16:56.749 --> 01:16:59.169
You have to go home to the family,
you understand?

01:16:59.252 --> 01:17:01.880
You got to go home, okay? Look at me.

01:17:02.172 --> 01:17:04.424
You gotta go home. Smarten up.

01:17:05.091 --> 01:17:06.676
- All right?
- All right.

01:17:06.801 --> 01:17:08.428
I'm gonna talk to Karen.

01:17:08.511 --> 01:17:12.056
I'll straighten this out.
I know just what to say to her.

01:17:12.557 --> 01:17:14.601
I'm gonna tell her you'll go back to her...

01:17:14.684 --> 01:17:17.729
and it'll be just the way
it was when you were first married...

01:17:17.812 --> 01:17:19.689
your romance, it's gonna be beautiful.

01:17:19.772 --> 01:17:21.816
I know how to talk to her,
especially to her.

01:17:21.900 --> 01:17:24.527
Jimmy and Tommy are going down
to Tampa this weekend...

01:17:24.611 --> 01:17:25.904
to pick up something for me.

01:17:25.987 --> 01:17:27.572
Instead, you go with Jimmy.

01:17:27.655 --> 01:17:29.157
You come with me, we'll go down.

01:17:29.240 --> 01:17:31.826
Have a good time.
Take some time for yourself. Relax.

01:17:31.910 --> 01:17:33.786
Sit in the sun. Take a couple days off.

01:17:33.870 --> 01:17:35.830
- We'll have a good time.
- Enjoy yourselves.

01:17:35.914 --> 01:17:38.583
And when you come back,
you go back to Karen.

01:17:39.209 --> 01:17:40.960
Please, there's no other way.

01:17:41.044 --> 01:17:43.755
You're not gonna get a divorce.
We're not <i>animali.</i>

01:17:43.838 --> 01:17:46.424
No divorce. She'll never divorce him.

01:17:48.218 --> 01:17:51.137
She'll kill him, but she won't divorce him.

01:17:55.433 --> 01:17:57.101
You gonna pay us?

01:18:03.483 --> 01:18:06.486
- You gonna pay?
- Give us the fucking money!

01:18:07.028 --> 01:18:09.072
I can't, I swear.

01:18:10.657 --> 01:18:11.908
Let's go.

01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:23.211
- We'll throw the bastard to the lions.
- No!

01:18:23.294 --> 01:18:26.089
What fucking lions?
I ain't going near any lions, Jimmy!

01:18:26.172 --> 01:18:28.591
- Let's throw him over the moat.
- All right.

01:18:28.675 --> 01:18:30.051
I'll get the money!

01:18:30.134 --> 01:18:32.929
<i>They must really feed each other</i>
<i>to the lions down there...</i>

01:18:33.012 --> 01:18:34.848
<i>because the guy gave the money right up.</i>

01:18:34.931 --> 01:18:36.641
I swear to Christ, I'll get the money.

01:18:36.724 --> 01:18:38.810
<i>We got to spend the rest of the weekend</i>
<i>at the track.</i>

01:18:39.269 --> 01:18:40.687
Yeah. They mean business.

01:18:40.770 --> 01:18:43.398
<i>Then, I couldn't believe what happened.</i>

01:18:43.815 --> 01:18:46.401
<i>When we got home,</i>
<i>we were all over the newspaper.</i>

01:18:46.484 --> 01:18:49.779
<i>At first, I didn't even know</i>
<i>why we got picked up.</i>

01:18:49.863 --> 01:18:52.073
<i>Then I found out</i>
<i>that the guy we roughed up...</i>

01:18:52.157 --> 01:18:55.618
<i>turned out to have a sister</i>
<i>working as a typist for the FBI.</i>

01:18:55.702 --> 01:18:58.538
<i>Who could believe it?</i>
<i>Of all the fucking people.</i>

01:18:58.621 --> 01:19:01.958
<i>She gave up everybody:</i>
<i>Jimmy, me, even her brother.</i>

01:19:03.376 --> 01:19:06.254
<i>It took the jury six hours</i>
<i>to bring us in guilty.</i>

01:19:06.379 --> 01:19:09.716
<i>The judge gave Jimmy and me 10 years</i>
<i>like he was giving away candy.</i>

01:19:09.799 --> 01:19:12.468
...ten years in a federal penitentiary.

01:19:12.677 --> 01:19:16.764
You will now be turned over
to the U.S. Attorney General's office.

01:19:21.019 --> 01:19:22.729
Toast, guys.

01:19:22.812 --> 01:19:25.231
Good trip, good life, get out soon.

01:19:25.315 --> 01:19:27.192
Good trip, sweetheart.

01:19:30.111 --> 01:19:32.238
We'll watch the home front.

01:19:33.698 --> 01:19:36.159
Say hello to those blow-job hacks.

01:19:37.202 --> 01:19:40.413
Yeah, motherfuck them
every chance you get.

01:19:46.252 --> 01:19:48.755
I'll call you when I get a chance.

01:20:01.142 --> 01:20:02.393
Now take me to jail.

01:20:07.106 --> 01:20:09.943
<i>In prison, dinner was always a big thing.</i>

01:20:10.276 --> 01:20:13.780
<i>We had a pasta course,</i>
<i>and then we had a meat or a fish.</i>

01:20:14.405 --> 01:20:17.367
<i>Paulie did the prep work.</i>
<i>He was doing a year for contempt...</i>

01:20:17.450 --> 01:20:19.869
<i>and had this wonderful system</i>
<i>for doing the garlic.</i>

01:20:19.953 --> 01:20:23.081
<i>He used a razor,</i>
<i>and he used to slice it so thin...</i>

01:20:23.164 --> 01:20:26.000
<i>that it used to liquefy in the pan</i>
<i>with just a little oil.</i>

01:20:26.084 --> 01:20:28.127
<i>It was a very good system.</i>

01:20:28.336 --> 01:20:30.922
<i>Vinnie was in charge of the tomato sauce.</i>

01:20:31.005 --> 01:20:32.465
Get the smell?

01:20:32.549 --> 01:20:35.385
Three kinds of meat in the meatballs:

01:20:35.468 --> 01:20:37.512
Veal, beef, and pork.

01:20:37.887 --> 01:20:40.056
Good, but you gotta have the pork.

01:20:40.139 --> 01:20:41.766
That's the flavor.

01:20:41.850 --> 01:20:45.395
<i>I felt he used too many onions,</i>
<i>but it was still a very good sauce.</i>

01:20:45.478 --> 01:20:48.314
Vinnie, don't put too many onions
in the sauce.

01:20:48.398 --> 01:20:51.025
I didn't put too much onions in, Paul.

01:20:51.317 --> 01:20:53.194
Put three small onions, that's all I did.

01:20:53.278 --> 01:20:56.030
Three onions? How many cans
of tomatoes you put in there?

01:20:56.114 --> 01:20:58.825
- I put two big cans.
- You don't need three onions.

01:20:58.908 --> 01:21:00.994
<i>Johnny Dio did the meat.</i>

01:21:01.077 --> 01:21:03.746
<i>We had no broiler,</i>
<i>so Johnny did everything in pans.</i>

01:21:03.830 --> 01:21:06.040
<i>It used to smell up the joint</i>
<i>something awful...</i>

01:21:06.124 --> 01:21:09.169
<i>and the hacks used to die,</i>
<i>but he still cooked a great steak.</i>

01:21:09.252 --> 01:21:11.796
- How do you like yours?
- Medium rare.

01:21:12.380 --> 01:21:14.507
Medium rare. An aristocrat.

01:21:14.924 --> 01:21:18.761
<i>You know, when you think of prison</i>
<i>you get pictures in your mind...</i>

01:21:18.845 --> 01:21:22.557
<i>of all those old movies</i>
<i>with rows of guys behind bars.</i>

01:21:22.640 --> 01:21:24.559
<i>It wasn't like that for wiseguys.</i>

01:21:24.642 --> 01:21:27.479
<i>It really wasn't that bad,</i>
<i>excepting that I missed Jimmy...</i>

01:21:27.562 --> 01:21:29.063
<i>who was doing his time in Atlanta.</i>

01:21:29.147 --> 01:21:32.192
Give me two steaks
while you're in there, all right?

01:21:33.026 --> 01:21:37.489
<i>Everyone else in the joint was doing</i>
<i>real time, mixed together, living like pigs.</i>

01:21:37.614 --> 01:21:40.700
<i>But we lived alone. We owned the joint.</i>

01:21:40.783 --> 01:21:44.245
We batted them sons of bitches.
You couldn't recognize them.

01:21:44.329 --> 01:21:45.747
Good, they deserved it.

01:21:45.830 --> 01:21:49.250
<i>Even the hacks we couldn't bribe</i>
<i>would never rat on the guys we did.</i>

01:21:49.334 --> 01:21:51.252
...had respect. People loved one another.

01:21:51.336 --> 01:21:52.504
They left their doors open.

01:21:52.587 --> 01:21:53.713
Sorry it took so long.

01:21:53.796 --> 01:21:56.466
The skinny guard's getting to be
a real pain in the ass.

01:21:56.549 --> 01:21:59.761
- We're gonna have to do something.
- I took care of him.

01:21:59.844 --> 01:22:01.638
What'd you bring?

01:22:01.721 --> 01:22:03.223
- Bread.
- Good.

01:22:03.556 --> 01:22:05.892
- Fresh.
- Vinnie, I got your peppers and onions.

01:22:05.975 --> 01:22:08.353
Salami, prosciutto, a lot of cheese.

01:22:08.436 --> 01:22:10.021
Come on, what else?

01:22:10.104 --> 01:22:11.606
- Scotch.
- Nice.

01:22:12.607 --> 01:22:14.442
- Some red wine.
- Okay.

01:22:14.776 --> 01:22:16.736
- Now we can eat.
- I got some white, too.

01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:18.655
Give me the white, too. Beautiful.

01:22:18.738 --> 01:22:21.741
Okay, boys, let's eat.
Come on, it's ready, Vinnie.

01:22:22.325 --> 01:22:23.493
Some more bread.

01:22:23.576 --> 01:22:26.454
Tomorrow we eat sandwiches.
You got to go on a diet, Vinnie.

01:22:26.538 --> 01:22:28.706
- You must be kidding.
- Believe me.

01:22:37.757 --> 01:22:39.425
What are you doing?

01:22:44.514 --> 01:22:46.391
I'll take that.

01:22:48.768 --> 01:22:51.312
- All right, I'll catch you guys later.
- Yeah.

01:22:51.396 --> 01:22:53.731
You going for a walk in the park?

01:22:55.275 --> 01:22:58.403
- Okay, I'll catch you next week. Thanks.
- Okay.

01:23:01.239 --> 01:23:03.950
- Is there any more?
- No, that's it. Have a good weekend.

01:23:04.033 --> 01:23:04.909
- Thanks.
- You too, Henry.

01:23:13.668 --> 01:23:14.878
Mrs. Hill, come here.

01:23:14.961 --> 01:23:16.129
Come on.

01:23:19.507 --> 01:23:21.593
You girls stay right here.

01:23:21.968 --> 01:23:25.346
- I want you to hold hands.
- Okay, go right up to the front.

01:23:25.555 --> 01:23:27.557
- Let's go.
- How you doing?

01:23:27.640 --> 01:23:30.185
- Good, how are you?
- Very well, thank you.

01:23:42.030 --> 01:23:44.782
- What you talking about?
- I saw her name in the register.

01:23:44.866 --> 01:23:46.993
- Jesus Christ.
- You want her to visit you?

01:23:47.076 --> 01:23:50.997
Let her stay up all night crying
and writing letters to the parole board.

01:23:51.080 --> 01:23:54.042
What am I doing here?
Where am I? I'm in jail.

01:23:54.292 --> 01:23:56.544
I can't stop people from coming to see me.

01:23:56.628 --> 01:24:00.006
Good, let her sneak this stuff in
for you every week.

01:24:00.089 --> 01:24:04.719
- Let her fight these bastards every week!
- Look what you're doing! Stop it!

01:24:06.179 --> 01:24:07.430
I'm sorry.

01:24:07.931 --> 01:24:10.391
Let her sneak this shit in for you.

01:24:11.434 --> 01:24:13.311
Will you stop it, Karen?

01:24:13.728 --> 01:24:16.314
- Let her do it!
- Stop it!

01:24:24.489 --> 01:24:27.867
Nobody's helping me. I'm all alone.

01:24:28.785 --> 01:24:30.829
Belle and Morrie are broke.

01:24:31.204 --> 01:24:34.499
I asked your friend Remo
for the money that he owes you.

01:24:34.582 --> 01:24:36.042
You know what he told me?

01:24:36.125 --> 01:24:39.796
He told me to take my kids down
to the police station and get on welfare.

01:24:39.879 --> 01:24:41.881
It's gonna be okay.

01:24:42.048 --> 01:24:46.219
Even Paulie, since he got out, I've never
seen him. I never see anybody anymore.

01:24:46.302 --> 01:24:49.180
It's only you and me.
That's what happens when you go away.

01:24:49.264 --> 01:24:53.268
I told you that we're on our own.
Forget everybody else. Forget Paulie.

01:24:54.269 --> 01:24:58.273
As long as he's on parole,
he doesn't want anybody doing anything.

01:25:00.733 --> 01:25:03.069
- I can't do it.
- Yes, you can. Listen to me.

01:25:03.153 --> 01:25:05.822
All I need for you
is to keep bringing me the stuff.

01:25:05.905 --> 01:25:08.700
I got a guy in here from Pittsburgh
who'll help me move it.

01:25:08.783 --> 01:25:10.368
In a month we're gonna be fine.

01:25:10.451 --> 01:25:12.954
- We won't need anybody.
- I'm afraid.

01:25:13.037 --> 01:25:15.081
I'm afraid if Paulie finds out...

01:25:15.165 --> 01:25:16.541
Don't worry about him.

01:25:16.624 --> 01:25:20.211
He is not helping us out.
Is he putting any food on the table?

01:25:21.337 --> 01:25:22.881
We've gotta help each other.

01:25:22.964 --> 01:25:26.634
We've just gotta be really careful
while we do it.

01:25:31.306 --> 01:25:33.558
I don't want to hear a word
about her anymore.

01:25:33.641 --> 01:25:34.726
Never.

01:26:00.084 --> 01:26:01.753
Daddy!

01:26:03.379 --> 01:26:05.715
- We missed you.
- Are you here to stay?

01:26:05.798 --> 01:26:09.427
Did you see our pictures?
I did the one with the house and rainbow.

01:26:09.511 --> 01:26:11.012
I did the sun.

01:26:11.137 --> 01:26:15.058
My chorus concert is in two weeks.
Are you coming?

01:26:15.892 --> 01:26:17.769
Do you like the house?

01:26:19.020 --> 01:26:21.105
Karen, get packed.
We're moving out of here.

01:26:21.189 --> 01:26:22.273
With what?

01:26:22.482 --> 01:26:25.485
Don't worry with what.
Just start looking for a new house.

01:26:25.568 --> 01:26:29.239
I got to go to Pittsburgh in the morning.
Those guys there owe me $15,000.

01:26:29.322 --> 01:26:31.324
We'll be all right. I got things lined up.

01:26:31.407 --> 01:26:34.285
Pittsburgh? You have to go see
your parole officer tomorrow.

01:26:34.369 --> 01:26:37.288
Don't worry about it.
Everything's gonna be fine.

01:26:37.872 --> 01:26:40.250
- Who wants to go to Uncle Paulie's?
- Me!

01:26:50.552 --> 01:26:52.136
What do you want?

01:26:52.387 --> 01:26:54.430
Sweetheart, let Mommy eat.

01:26:57.892 --> 01:27:00.770
You look good.
Did you eat this good in the joint?

01:27:02.897 --> 01:27:04.774
I don't want any more of that shit.

01:27:04.858 --> 01:27:05.984
What shit?

01:27:06.067 --> 01:27:08.778
- Just stay away from the garbage.
- Look, Paulie...

01:27:08.862 --> 01:27:12.282
I'm not talking about what you did inside.
You did what you had to do.

01:27:12.365 --> 01:27:15.076
I'm talking about now. From now.
Here and now.

01:27:15.827 --> 01:27:18.663
- Why would I get into that?
- Don't make a jerk out of me.

01:27:18.746 --> 01:27:20.331
Just don't do it.

01:27:24.043 --> 01:27:27.088
I want to talk to you about Jimmy.
You gotta watch out for him.

01:27:27.172 --> 01:27:30.008
He's a good earner, but he's wild,
takes too many chances.

01:27:30.091 --> 01:27:32.635
I know Jimmy. You think
I would take chances like him?

01:27:32.719 --> 01:27:34.470
Tommy's a good kid, but he's crazy.

01:27:34.554 --> 01:27:36.389
He's a cowboy.
He's got too much to prove.

01:27:36.473 --> 01:27:38.224
You gotta watch out for kids like this.

01:27:38.308 --> 01:27:41.019
I know what they are.
I only use them for certain things.

01:27:41.102 --> 01:27:43.730
I ain't gonna get fucked like Gribbs,
you understand?

01:27:43.813 --> 01:27:48.318
Gribbs is 70 years old. The fucking guy's
gonna die in prison. I don't need that.

01:27:48.526 --> 01:27:52.530
So I'm warning everybody. Everybody.
Could be my son, could be anybody.

01:27:52.780 --> 01:27:55.533
Gribbs got 20 years just
for saying hello to some fuck...

01:27:55.617 --> 01:27:57.702
who was sneaking behind his back,
selling junk.

01:27:57.785 --> 01:28:00.371
I don't need that.
That won't happen to me, understand?

01:28:00.455 --> 01:28:02.749
You know you're out early
because I got you a job.

01:28:02.832 --> 01:28:04.876
I don't need this heat,
you understand that?

01:28:04.959 --> 01:28:08.922
You see anybody fucking around
with this shit you're gonna tell me, right?

01:28:09.005 --> 01:28:10.215
That means anybody.

01:28:10.298 --> 01:28:11.382
- All right.
- Yeah?

01:28:11.466 --> 01:28:13.051
Yeah. Of course.

01:28:20.391 --> 01:28:24.562
<i>Took me about a week of sneaking around</i>
<i>before I could unload the Pittsburgh stuff.</i>

01:28:24.646 --> 01:28:27.232
<i>But when I did, it was a real score.</i>

01:28:27.315 --> 01:28:29.901
<i>I started using Sandy's place</i>
<i>to mix the stuff.</i>

01:28:29.984 --> 01:28:32.529
<i>And even with Sandy snorting</i>
<i>more than she mixed...</i>

01:28:32.612 --> 01:28:35.323
<i>I could see that</i>
<i>this was a really good business.</i>

01:28:35.406 --> 01:28:37.826
<i>I made $12,000 in my second week.</i>

01:28:38.409 --> 01:28:41.579
<i>I had a down payment on my house</i>
<i>and things were really rolling.</i>

01:28:41.663 --> 01:28:45.917
<i>All I had to do was every once in a while</i>
<i>tell Sandy that I loved her.</i>

01:28:49.504 --> 01:28:51.548
<i>But it was perfect, I'm telling you.</i>

01:28:51.631 --> 01:28:54.217
<i>As long as I kept getting</i>
<i>the stuff from Pittsburgh...</i>

01:28:54.300 --> 01:28:56.052
<i>I knew Paulie would never find out.</i>

01:28:56.135 --> 01:29:00.056
<i>Within a couple of weeks,</i>
<i>it got so big I needed some help.</i>

01:29:00.390 --> 01:29:03.184
<i>So I got Jimmy and Tommy</i>
<i>to come in with me.</i>

01:29:03.560 --> 01:29:05.186
It's fucking great.

01:29:05.270 --> 01:29:06.521
Mr. Conway.

01:29:12.360 --> 01:29:14.279
- Bring your pay slips?
- Yeah.

01:29:17.323 --> 01:29:19.659
Four and a half months of dirt.

01:29:20.827 --> 01:29:22.787
- It's so good.
- I did it.

01:29:23.955 --> 01:29:26.583
- Do you love it?
- It's wonderful.

01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:30.879
And this we just had to have made special.
Go ahead, sit in it, Belle.

01:29:30.962 --> 01:29:33.464
The others you couldn't even sit in.

01:29:33.673 --> 01:29:35.258
Okay, you ready?

01:29:35.341 --> 01:29:37.510
Watch the wall with the rock.

01:29:45.143 --> 01:29:47.979
The electricians did it special. Come on.

01:29:49.147 --> 01:29:50.982
Come on. All right.

01:29:51.065 --> 01:29:54.736
This was imported. It came in two pieces.
Do you believe what they can do?

01:29:54.819 --> 01:29:56.237
It's nice, huh?

01:29:56.321 --> 01:29:58.448
Henry, come over here.
Did you and Jimmy talk?

01:29:58.531 --> 01:30:01.075
I talked to him,
and he's looking into everything.

01:30:01.159 --> 01:30:04.454
This'll make the Air France haul
look like goddamn peanuts.

01:30:04.537 --> 01:30:06.873
- Come on.
- He's gonna do it, right?

01:30:06.956 --> 01:30:08.833
I told you. He'll check everything out.

01:30:08.917 --> 01:30:11.669
He's looking into it.
We'll see what happens. No promises.

01:30:11.753 --> 01:30:15.965
I know. Do you understand?
There's millions in there. And I've been...

01:30:16.049 --> 01:30:19.802
bleeding for this caper, been cultivating
this son of a bitch for two years.

01:30:19.886 --> 01:30:23.014
He owes me $20,000. Once in a lifetime.
I could retire.

01:30:23.097 --> 01:30:27.060
No more nut every week.
No more bullshit. My dream comes true.

01:30:27.143 --> 01:30:29.145
Morrie, let's get a drink.

01:30:29.646 --> 01:30:32.732
<i>These are the guys that Jimmy</i>
<i>put together for what turned out to be...</i>

01:30:32.816 --> 01:30:36.694
<i>the biggest heist in American history:</i>
<i>The Lufthansa heist.</i>

01:30:37.987 --> 01:30:40.740
<i>Tommy and Carbone were gonna grab</i>
<i>the outside guard...</i>

01:30:40.824 --> 01:30:43.368
<i>and make him get us in the front door.</i>

01:30:44.619 --> 01:30:47.872
<i>Frenchy and Joe Buddha</i>
<i>had to round up the workers.</i>

01:30:48.456 --> 01:30:52.585
<i>Johnny Roastbeef had to keep them</i>
<i>all tied up and away from the alarms.</i>

01:30:53.211 --> 01:30:55.505
<i>Even Stacks Edwards got in on it.</i>

01:30:55.588 --> 01:30:59.217
<i>He used to hang around the lounge</i>
<i>and play guitar. Everybody loved Stacks.</i>

01:30:59.300 --> 01:31:01.886
<i>What he was supposed to do</i>
<i>was steal the panel truck...</i>

01:31:01.970 --> 01:31:05.098
<i>and afterwards compact it</i>
<i>by a friend of ours out in Jersey.</i>

01:31:05.181 --> 01:31:07.642
<i>Only Morrie was driving us nuts.</i>

01:31:07.725 --> 01:31:09.727
Morrie, have a drink and shut up.

01:31:09.811 --> 01:31:13.064
<i>Just because he set this up,</i>
<i>he felt he could bust Jimmy's balls...</i>

01:31:13.148 --> 01:31:15.733
<i>for an advance on the money</i>
<i>we were going to steal.</i>

01:31:15.817 --> 01:31:19.445
<i>He didn't mean anything by it.</i>
<i>That's just the way he was.</i>

01:31:26.286 --> 01:31:30.415
<i>I had everybody working for me.</i>
<i>Even our old baby-sitter, Lois Byrd.</i>

01:31:33.418 --> 01:31:34.878
Did you have a good flight?

01:31:34.961 --> 01:31:37.630
I hate Pittsburgh.
Where did you find such creeps?

01:31:37.714 --> 01:31:39.716
Come on, they're not that bad.

01:31:40.842 --> 01:31:42.719
And it's worth it, isn't it?

01:31:43.011 --> 01:31:45.513
Is this the same baby you used last week?

01:31:45.597 --> 01:31:48.725
No, that one was my sister's.
This is Deirdra's.

01:31:49.684 --> 01:31:50.935
Big yawn.

01:31:51.019 --> 01:31:52.770
She looks just like you.

01:31:53.438 --> 01:31:55.773
That's what the stewardess said.

01:32:08.411 --> 01:32:10.413
Take it easy, Sandy.

01:32:10.497 --> 01:32:13.291
Come on, give me a break.
You got enough here to go around.

01:32:13.374 --> 01:32:16.836
You got all day. Just make it last,
all right? Take it easy.

01:32:17.212 --> 01:32:19.088
- I got to go.
- Where are you going?

01:32:19.172 --> 01:32:23.301
Don't start. You know I gotta go
do this thing. Fuck, where are my keys?

01:32:24.594 --> 01:32:26.012
Over there.

01:32:26.095 --> 01:32:27.764
It's a mess. It's like a pig pen.

01:32:27.847 --> 01:32:29.974
What do you think
I got you the dishwasher for?

01:32:30.058 --> 01:32:32.018
I hate doing the dishes. Fucks up my nails.

01:32:32.101 --> 01:32:33.978
How could you hate it?
You got to be smart.

01:32:34.062 --> 01:32:37.357
Look at all this powder around here.
That could put us away forever.

01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:39.692
- Loosen up.
- What are you doing?

01:32:40.693 --> 01:32:44.072
- You know, I gotta...
- You don't have to go anywhere.

01:32:45.198 --> 01:32:46.741
Make them wait.

01:32:56.042 --> 01:32:59.838
<i>Nobody knows for sure just how much</i>
<i>was taken in the daring pre-dawn raid...</i>

01:32:59.921 --> 01:33:02.632
<i>at the Lufthansa cargo terminal</i>
<i>at Kennedy Airport.</i>

01:33:02.715 --> 01:33:06.469
<i>The FBI says $2 million,</i>
<i>Port Authority Police say $4 million...</i>

01:33:09.806 --> 01:33:11.933
Jimmy!

01:33:12.016 --> 01:33:13.935
Those sons of bitches!

01:33:14.018 --> 01:33:16.437
<i>... from the scene of the heist at JFK.</i>

01:33:16.521 --> 01:33:20.191
<i>It looks like a big one. Maybe the biggest</i>
<i>this town has ever seen.</i>

01:33:22.068 --> 01:33:24.237
Come here, you! Come here!

01:33:25.321 --> 01:33:28.032
Look at this genius. This genius!

01:33:32.453 --> 01:33:34.372
Merry Christmas.

01:33:39.210 --> 01:33:41.588
- Hello, who's this?
- That's my wife.

01:33:42.213 --> 01:33:45.550
Come here.
I want to show you something, Jimmy.

01:33:48.219 --> 01:33:49.679
Isn't she gorgeous?

01:33:49.762 --> 01:33:52.974
I bought it for my wife.
It's a coupe. I love that car.

01:33:55.768 --> 01:33:58.688
What did I tell you?
I talked to you before, didn't I?

01:33:58.771 --> 01:34:00.190
Didn't I say what was going on?

01:34:00.273 --> 01:34:02.484
Didn't I say not to go buy anything
for a while?

01:34:02.567 --> 01:34:05.612
- The fucking car?
- It's a wedding gift from my mother.

01:34:05.695 --> 01:34:07.906
It's under her name. I just got married.

01:34:07.989 --> 01:34:10.867
- I love that car.
- Excuse me, darling, for just a second.

01:34:10.950 --> 01:34:13.328
- I just got married.
- Are you nuts?

01:34:13.411 --> 01:34:15.914
- What are you getting excited for?
- Are you stupid?

01:34:15.997 --> 01:34:18.791
We got a million bulls out there.
Everybody's watching us.

01:34:18.875 --> 01:34:20.752
And you get a fucking car. I'm excited?

01:34:20.835 --> 01:34:23.129
It's under my mother's name.
It's a wedding gift.

01:34:23.213 --> 01:34:25.131
I don't give a fuck. Are you stupid?

01:34:25.215 --> 01:34:27.467
Didn't you hear what I said?
Don't buy anything.

01:34:27.550 --> 01:34:31.304
Don't get anything. Nothing big.
What's the matter with you?

01:34:31.471 --> 01:34:33.014
What are you getting excited for?

01:34:33.097 --> 01:34:36.643
Because you're going to get us all
fucking pinched. What are you, stupid?

01:34:36.726 --> 01:34:39.479
- What's the matter with you?
- I apologize.

01:34:40.855 --> 01:34:44.067
- I'm sorry.
- What the fuck is the matter with you?

01:34:46.361 --> 01:34:47.695
I'm sorry.

01:34:50.323 --> 01:34:53.827
I'm sorry, Jimmy.
It's under my mother's name.

01:34:54.494 --> 01:34:57.247
What'd you say? You being
a fucking wise guy with me?

01:34:57.330 --> 01:35:00.250
- I'm sorry. I apologize.
- What did I tell you?

01:35:00.667 --> 01:35:03.753
What did I tell you?
You don't buy anything, you hear me?

01:35:03.837 --> 01:35:05.547
Don't buy anything!

01:35:05.630 --> 01:35:07.257
I'm sorry, Jimmy.

01:35:10.468 --> 01:35:12.929
The fat fuck, he ought to wear a sign.

01:35:20.353 --> 01:35:22.772
I can't believe this.
Are you stupid or what?

01:35:22.856 --> 01:35:24.190
Excuse me.

01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:26.192
- What's the matter?
- Take it off.

01:35:26.276 --> 01:35:29.279
- Why? What's the matter?
- Take it off!

01:35:31.447 --> 01:35:35.034
Didn't I tell you not to get anything big
and not to attract attention?

01:35:35.118 --> 01:35:38.288
In two days, one guy gets a Caddy
and one gets a $20,000 mink.

01:35:38.371 --> 01:35:40.331
- Bring it fucking back.
- I'll bring it back.

01:35:40.415 --> 01:35:44.002
I don't care what you do.
Bring it where you got it before.

01:35:44.085 --> 01:35:46.963
- Get it out of here!
- All right. Let's go, honey.

01:35:51.092 --> 01:35:53.219
Shut the fuck up and let's go.

01:35:56.264 --> 01:35:58.808
This drink here is better than sex, babe.

01:36:00.768 --> 01:36:04.981
I'm gonna go see Stacks. Don't you look
at anybody or I'll fucking kill you.

01:36:05.064 --> 01:36:09.319
He's so jealous. If I even look
at anyone else, he'll kill me.

01:36:09.527 --> 01:36:11.029
That's great.

01:36:11.154 --> 01:36:14.240
Tell them all to relax.
Don't attract attention.

01:36:17.327 --> 01:36:19.245
I've been looking all over for you.

01:36:19.329 --> 01:36:20.997
How are you? Merry Christmas.

01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:23.124
Listen, I need the money.

01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:27.045
- Morrie, relax, okay? It's Christmas.
- Jimmy, I need the money.

01:36:27.128 --> 01:36:29.380
I'm relaxing. I need the money.

01:36:29.464 --> 01:36:32.550
- I did what I had to do. I need the money.
- Not tonight, Morrie.

01:36:32.634 --> 01:36:36.638
Listen, I did my caper. He owes me.
Everybody's flashing their stuff.

01:36:36.721 --> 01:36:39.557
Evidently, they got their money.
I'm wearing the same shit.

01:36:39.641 --> 01:36:43.102
- Just not tonight.
- They're wearing it. I gotta talk to him.

01:36:45.438 --> 01:36:48.066
I got $500,000 coming to me.

01:36:48.149 --> 01:36:50.693
The biggest fucking bundle
he ever made in his life.

01:36:50.777 --> 01:36:53.488
Morrie, I'll go talk to him.
Go have a drink, all right?

01:36:53.571 --> 01:36:55.740
- I'll talk to him.
- It's poison in my eyes.

01:36:55.824 --> 01:36:58.743
- Morris, baby, are you all right?
- No, I'm not.

01:37:04.499 --> 01:37:07.877
Christmas. Your share. Just a little taste.

01:37:11.047 --> 01:37:12.382
We did it!

01:37:15.385 --> 01:37:17.095
- Jimmy.
- Yeah.

01:37:17.720 --> 01:37:19.722
- Yeah, who is it?
- It's me.

01:37:19.806 --> 01:37:21.432
Pete? One second.

01:37:22.016 --> 01:37:25.395
Don't do what Frankie and Johnny did.
Don't be a moron with the money.

01:37:25.478 --> 01:37:27.313
- Do what's right, you understand?
- Yeah.

01:37:28.064 --> 01:37:30.650
Karen, Judy, Ruth, come here!

01:37:31.192 --> 01:37:33.903
I got the most expensive tree they had.

01:37:35.363 --> 01:37:38.992
- What do you think, Mommy?
- I love them all.

01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.827
I love the gold outfit.

01:37:40.910 --> 01:37:42.745
- Merry Christmas.
- Thank you.

01:37:42.829 --> 01:37:44.289
- What?
- Merry Christmas.

01:37:44.372 --> 01:37:45.707
And?

01:37:46.082 --> 01:37:47.625
Happy Hanukkah.

01:37:48.501 --> 01:37:51.754
- Very funny.
- Go get yourself something nice, okay?

01:38:00.096 --> 01:38:04.434
<i>Lufthansa should have been</i>
<i>our ultimate score. The heist of a lifetime.</i>

01:38:05.018 --> 01:38:08.271
<i>$6 million in cash.</i>
<i>More than enough to go around.</i>

01:38:18.281 --> 01:38:19.741
Yo, Stacks!

01:38:20.116 --> 01:38:22.744
Open up! What's up? What're you doing?

01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:32.837
What's with you? He ain't ready.
I knew you wouldn't be ready.

01:38:32.921 --> 01:38:36.382
- You didn't bring any coffee?
- What do I look like, a fucking caterer?

01:38:36.466 --> 01:38:39.761
Frankie will make coffee.
Go ahead, Frankie, make coffee.

01:38:42.472 --> 01:38:44.641
Thought you had
one of your bitches in here.

01:38:44.724 --> 01:38:47.143
Yeah, I did. Where the fuck is she?

01:38:48.144 --> 01:38:51.189
Always got these hot books around,
or a bitch, or something.

01:38:51.272 --> 01:38:52.565
What time is it?

01:38:52.649 --> 01:38:56.694
- It's 11:30. We had to be there by 9:00.
- I'll be ready in a minute.

01:38:56.778 --> 01:39:00.782
You're always fucking late.
You'd be late for your own fucking funeral.

01:39:05.662 --> 01:39:09.582
What the fuck you looking at?
Make that coffee to go. Let's go.

01:39:12.710 --> 01:39:14.671
What the fuck you doing? It's a joke.

01:39:14.754 --> 01:39:17.799
Put the fucking pot down.
You gonna take the coffee?

01:39:37.443 --> 01:39:39.404
<i>Stacks was always crazy.</i>

01:39:39.737 --> 01:39:43.491
<i>Instead of getting rid of the truck</i>
<i>as he was supposed to, he got stoned...</i>

01:39:43.575 --> 01:39:48.204
<i>went to his girlfriend's, and by the time</i>
<i>he woke up, the cops had found the truck.</i>

01:39:48.288 --> 01:39:50.456
<i>It was all over the television.</i>

01:39:50.540 --> 01:39:53.668
<i>They even said they came up</i>
<i>with prints off the wheel.</i>

01:39:54.252 --> 01:39:57.714
<i>It was just a matter of time</i>
<i>before they got to Stacks.</i>

01:40:09.476 --> 01:40:11.269
I gotta talk to you.

01:40:11.519 --> 01:40:14.105
- Have a drink.
- Have a drink. Come on.

01:40:14.606 --> 01:40:18.401
Have a drink. What you doing?
It's an occasion. Have a drink.

01:40:19.736 --> 01:40:21.779
I still gotta talk to you.

01:40:22.113 --> 01:40:23.198
What?

01:40:23.281 --> 01:40:25.867
- What happened with Stacks?
- Don't worry about that.

01:40:25.950 --> 01:40:29.746
- There's feds all over the place.
- So what? Where are they gonna go?

01:40:30.246 --> 01:40:32.790
- It's in the papers.
- He's worried.

01:40:33.291 --> 01:40:35.126
What are you worried about?

01:40:35.210 --> 01:40:38.713
The television and the newspapers.
All the shit's out there.

01:40:38.796 --> 01:40:42.050
- What are you worried about?
- You worry too much.

01:40:42.342 --> 01:40:45.053
Everything is beautiful.
There's nothing to worry about.

01:40:45.136 --> 01:40:47.597
- Didn't you tell him?
- I didn't tell him yet.

01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.140
- What?
- Guess what?

01:40:50.725 --> 01:40:52.435
They're gonna make him.

01:40:54.062 --> 01:40:55.980
Paulie's going to make you?

01:40:56.773 --> 01:40:57.982
Tommy.

01:40:58.066 --> 01:41:00.693
They opened up the books.
Paulie got the okay.

01:41:00.777 --> 01:41:03.530
You believe that?
This little guinea bastard.

01:41:04.447 --> 01:41:08.952
He's gonna get made. We're gonna work
for this guy one day. He's gonna be a boss.

01:41:09.953 --> 01:41:11.621
I can't believe it.

01:41:11.704 --> 01:41:13.957
I'm really happy for you.
Great. Congratulations.

01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:16.042
Motherfuckers, we got them now.

01:41:16.835 --> 01:41:21.130
Jimmy, I've been looking all over for you.
Can I talk to you a second?

01:41:21.881 --> 01:41:24.300
I mastermind the goddamn thing,
I'm left with dick.

01:41:24.384 --> 01:41:27.929
They'd be up a creek if not for me.
Fuck him! I want my money.

01:41:28.138 --> 01:41:30.306
I want my money! I've had it up to here!

01:41:30.390 --> 01:41:32.767
That cheap cigarette hijacker.

01:41:32.892 --> 01:41:35.687
- Fuck him! I want my money!
- Good. Go tell him.

01:41:38.439 --> 01:41:41.234
You're gonna keep your mouth shut,
or what?

01:41:42.861 --> 01:41:44.821
Morrie, you're gonna get your money.

01:41:44.904 --> 01:41:47.365
You just got to stop busting balls.

01:41:47.782 --> 01:41:50.743
All right? Look at me. You hear me?
Look at me, okay?

01:41:50.827 --> 01:41:52.996
Everything's going to be fine.

01:41:59.127 --> 01:42:00.211
Henry.

01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:09.721
Sweetheart, half mick, half guinea?
I'll sing with an Italian accent.

01:42:51.596 --> 01:42:54.974
<i>I could see for the first time</i>
<i>that Jimmy was a nervous wreck.</i>

01:42:55.058 --> 01:42:58.353
<i>His mind was going in</i>
<i>eight different directions at once.</i>

01:43:00.522 --> 01:43:03.024
Think Morrie tells his wife everything?

01:43:03.274 --> 01:43:04.692
Morrie? Him?

01:43:05.235 --> 01:43:08.196
<i>That's when I knew</i>
<i>Jimmy was going to whack Morrie.</i>

01:43:08.279 --> 01:43:12.617
<i>That's how it happens. That's how fast</i>
<i>it takes for a guy to get whacked.</i>

01:43:13.284 --> 01:43:15.745
He's a nut job. He talks to everybody.

01:43:15.829 --> 01:43:19.374
Acts like a jerk in his commercials.
Nobody listens to what he says.

01:43:19.457 --> 01:43:22.669
Nobody fucking cares what he says,
he talks so much.

01:43:22.877 --> 01:43:25.547
Make sure you bring him here tonight.

01:43:25.672 --> 01:43:27.298
- Okay?
- All right.

01:43:29.717 --> 01:43:32.679
Start like this. Sorry.
Did I get you in the eye?

01:43:32.762 --> 01:43:34.806
Stop breaking my balls, all right?

01:43:34.889 --> 01:43:36.850
<i>I was just stalling for time.</i>

01:43:37.517 --> 01:43:41.604
<i>I knew I still had till 8:00 or 9:00</i>
<i>to talk Jimmy out of killing Morrie.</i>

01:43:41.813 --> 01:43:45.900
<i>But meanwhile, as far as Jimmy knew,</i>
<i>I was going along with the program.</i>

01:43:45.984 --> 01:43:49.779
I pulled his hair out of his fucking head.
I bit him. He's out cold.

01:43:51.906 --> 01:43:54.242
I'm enraged.
I wanted to kill this little fuck.

01:43:54.325 --> 01:43:57.245
I walk away.
We start to go in the fucking joint.

01:43:57.620 --> 01:44:00.999
I don't want to turn around.
Jimmy's going like this to me.

01:44:01.374 --> 01:44:03.251
I don't want to fucking turn around.

01:44:03.334 --> 01:44:07.297
I don't want to turn around. He picks up
his fucking head, he says...

01:44:08.214 --> 01:44:10.091
I said, "Don't say it."

01:44:14.971 --> 01:44:16.306
"Jerkoff!"

01:44:19.058 --> 01:44:22.645
What are you going to do? What?
I fucking fly at him.

01:44:22.729 --> 01:44:25.773
I got him and I'm banging his head,
banging his fucking face.

01:44:25.857 --> 01:44:27.692
I'm pulling his hair out of his head.

01:44:27.775 --> 01:44:30.862
I beat him to a pulp. To a pulp I beat him.

01:44:30.945 --> 01:44:33.948
He's laying there full of fucking blood.
I'm out of breath.

01:44:34.032 --> 01:44:36.659
Forget about tonight. Forget about it.

01:44:37.494 --> 01:44:39.537
<i>It was a load off my mind.</i>

01:44:40.622 --> 01:44:41.915
<i>Poor bastard.</i>

01:44:41.998 --> 01:44:44.417
<i>He never knew how close he'd come</i>
<i>to getting killed.</i>

01:44:44.501 --> 01:44:47.545
<i>Even if I told him,</i>
<i>he would have never believed me.</i>

01:44:49.047 --> 01:44:53.051
- Jimmy, could I talk to you now?
- You're a pisser. A real pisser.

01:44:53.635 --> 01:44:56.971
Want to talk now? Okay, let's talk.
Let's get it over with.

01:44:57.055 --> 01:45:00.099
I've never met a ball buster like you,
my whole life.

01:45:00.183 --> 01:45:02.310
Who loves you more than I do?

01:45:02.393 --> 01:45:05.730
- I'd do anything for you.
- Except to stop busting my balls.

01:45:06.648 --> 01:45:09.108
- Let's go have coffee.
- Want to go to the diner?

01:45:09.192 --> 01:45:11.611
We'll go to the diner on the boulevard.

01:45:12.153 --> 01:45:15.156
- Which diner?
- Rockaway Boulevard. It's open 24 hours.

01:45:15.240 --> 01:45:17.450
- They got Danishes?
- They got everything.

01:45:17.534 --> 01:45:19.911
Let's pick up some Danishes for Belle.

01:45:20.495 --> 01:45:24.666
Hear about the points we were shaving
up in Boston? It's terrific. Nunzio...

01:45:32.882 --> 01:45:34.509
I thought he'd never shut up.

01:45:34.592 --> 01:45:36.344
What a pain in the ass.

01:45:36.427 --> 01:45:39.347
- What'll we do with him?
- Chop him up and get rid of the car.

01:45:39.430 --> 01:45:41.432
Call me when you're through.

01:45:41.516 --> 01:45:44.018
- Frank, let's chop him up.
- All right.

01:45:44.102 --> 01:45:46.729
Where you going,
you dizzy motherfucker, you?

01:45:46.813 --> 01:45:47.897
You said chop him up.

01:45:47.981 --> 01:45:51.401
At Charlie's, not here!
Where are you gonna chop him here?

01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:55.071
Come on, what are you doing?
Get out of here.

01:45:55.155 --> 01:45:57.323
I got a better shot letting him drive.

01:45:57.407 --> 01:45:59.242
The car's cold.

01:45:59.325 --> 01:46:02.912
Get the fuck out of here!
What, warm it up? Get out of here!

01:46:03.746 --> 01:46:06.291
- Who is it?
- It's Belle. Open up.

01:46:06.374 --> 01:46:08.084
It's Belle. Let me in.

01:46:08.960 --> 01:46:12.839
Morris didn't come home. He's missing.
I know something's happened.

01:46:12.922 --> 01:46:14.257
Calm down.

01:46:14.549 --> 01:46:17.051
He's missing! I know something happened.

01:46:17.135 --> 01:46:19.429
He's probably drunk
and fell asleep somewhere.

01:46:19.512 --> 01:46:23.266
In 27 years, he's never been away all night
without calling.

01:46:23.349 --> 01:46:26.227
I know something's happened.
I know you know.

01:46:26.311 --> 01:46:29.939
Let me get changed.
I'll take you home, then look for him.

01:46:30.106 --> 01:46:33.401
- I've been home! I've been on the phone...
- He's playing cards.

01:46:36.779 --> 01:46:39.324
- What'll I tell Belle?
- Who gives a fuck?

01:46:40.200 --> 01:46:43.703
Tell her he ran off with some broad.
What do you care?

01:46:43.786 --> 01:46:45.914
- Watch this.
- Don't fuck with them.

01:46:45.997 --> 01:46:48.041
I do it all the time. I'll bust their balls.

01:46:48.124 --> 01:46:51.002
Don't give them the satisfaction,
the fucks.

01:46:53.463 --> 01:46:55.799
Come on, fuckos. Let's go for a ride.

01:46:57.091 --> 01:46:58.843
Keep them up all night.

01:46:59.761 --> 01:47:01.346
I'll see you later.

01:47:50.979 --> 01:47:54.232
<i>Jimmy was cutting every link</i>
<i>between himself and the robbery...</i>

01:47:54.315 --> 01:47:56.734
<i>but it had nothing to do with me.</i>

01:48:07.245 --> 01:48:10.540
<i>I gave Jimmy the tip and he gave me</i>
<i>some Christmas money.</i>

01:48:12.333 --> 01:48:14.752
<i>From then on, I kept my mouth shut.</i>

01:48:14.836 --> 01:48:18.798
<i>I knew Jimmy. He had the cash. It was his.</i>

01:48:18.882 --> 01:48:22.218
<i>He kicked some money upstairs to Paulie,</i>
<i>but that was it.</i>

01:48:23.344 --> 01:48:26.848
<i>It made him sick to turn the money over</i>
<i>to the guys who stole it.</i>

01:48:26.931 --> 01:48:29.851
<i>He'd rather whack them.</i>
<i>Anyway, what did I care?</i>

01:48:29.934 --> 01:48:31.853
<i>I wasn't asking for anything.</i>

01:48:31.936 --> 01:48:35.690
<i>And Jimmy was making nice money</i>
<i>through my Pittsburgh connections.</i>

01:48:36.149 --> 01:48:40.195
<i>Still, months after the robbery</i>
<i>they were finding bodies all over.</i>

01:49:02.217 --> 01:49:05.053
<i>When they found Carbone</i>
<i>in the meat truck...</i>

01:49:05.136 --> 01:49:06.846
<i>he was frozen so stiff...</i>

01:49:06.930 --> 01:49:10.058
<i>it took them two days</i>
<i>to thaw him out for the autopsy.</i>

01:49:14.896 --> 01:49:17.065
<i>Still, I never saw Jimmy so happy.</i>

01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:21.110
<i>He was like a kid. We had money</i>
<i>coming in through my Pittsburgh people...</i>

01:49:21.194 --> 01:49:24.739
<i>and even after a while,</i>
<i>the Lufthansa thing began to calm down.</i>

01:49:24.906 --> 01:49:27.158
<i>What made Jimmy so happy</i>
<i>that morning...</i>

01:49:27.242 --> 01:49:30.286
<i>was that this was the day</i>
<i>that Tommy was being made.</i>

01:49:30.620 --> 01:49:33.665
<i>Jimmy was so excited,</i>
<i>you'd think he was being made.</i>

01:49:34.249 --> 01:49:36.918
<i>He must have made four calls</i>
<i>to Tommy's house.</i>

01:49:37.085 --> 01:49:41.131
<i>They had a signal set up, so he'd know</i>
<i>the minute the ceremony was over.</i>

01:49:41.923 --> 01:49:44.134
- Ma, where are you?
- Here I am.

01:49:44.759 --> 01:49:47.345
- You're home.
- Home? I'm leaving.

01:49:47.762 --> 01:49:50.390
- You look lovely.
- I look good, huh?

01:49:50.473 --> 01:49:53.893
You look wonderful. Be careful.
Congratulations.

01:49:54.561 --> 01:49:57.939
I love you. Don't paint
any more religious pictures, please.

01:49:58.022 --> 01:49:59.732
- God be with you.
- Bye, Ma.

01:49:59.816 --> 01:50:02.235
<i>We always called each other goodfellas.</i>

01:50:02.318 --> 01:50:04.028
<i>You'd say to somebody:</i>

01:50:04.112 --> 01:50:08.324
<i>"You'll like this guy. He's all right.</i>
<i>He's a goodfella, one of us. "</i>

01:50:08.700 --> 01:50:10.076
<i>You understand?</i>

01:50:10.743 --> 01:50:13.079
<i>We were goodfellas. Wiseguys.</i>

01:50:15.540 --> 01:50:18.960
<i>But Jimmy and I could never be made</i>
<i>because we had Irish blood.</i>

01:50:19.043 --> 01:50:21.546
<i>It didn't matter my mother was Sicilian.</i>

01:50:21.796 --> 01:50:25.800
<i>To become a member of a crew,</i>
<i>you've got to be 100% Italian...</i>

01:50:25.884 --> 01:50:29.179
<i>so they can trace your relatives</i>
<i>back to the old country.</i>

01:50:36.227 --> 01:50:38.646
<i>It's the highest honor they can give you.</i>

01:50:38.730 --> 01:50:41.316
<i>It means you belong</i>
<i>to a family and a crew.</i>

01:50:41.608 --> 01:50:44.152
<i>It means nobody can fuck around</i>
<i>with you.</i>

01:50:44.652 --> 01:50:47.155
<i>It also means you could</i>
<i>fuck around with anybody...</i>

01:50:47.238 --> 01:50:49.741
<i>just as long as they aren't also a member.</i>

01:50:49.824 --> 01:50:53.286
<i>It's like a license to steal.</i>
<i>A license to do anything.</i>

01:50:55.455 --> 01:50:57.499
How many years ago
since you were made?

01:50:57.582 --> 01:51:00.418
- I'm an old-timer. 30 years ago.
- Thirty years?

01:51:00.502 --> 01:51:04.798
Brings back a lot of memories.
Pike's Peak was a pimple then, wasn't it?

01:51:08.051 --> 01:51:11.095
<i>As far as Jimmy was concerned,</i>
<i>with Tommy being made...</i>

01:51:11.179 --> 01:51:13.598
<i>it was like we were all being made.</i>

01:51:14.474 --> 01:51:17.143
<i>We would now have</i>
<i>one of our own as a member.</i>

01:51:32.992 --> 01:51:34.661
- Who's this?
<i>- This is Vinnie.</i>

01:51:34.744 --> 01:51:37.664
Vinnie. What happened?
Did we get straightened out?

01:51:37.747 --> 01:51:40.834
<i>No, we had a problem.</i>
<i>We tried to do everything we could.</i>

01:51:40.917 --> 01:51:42.001
What do you mean?

01:51:42.085 --> 01:51:46.256
<i>You know what I mean. He's gone,</i>
<i>and we couldn't do nothing about it.</i>

01:51:48.174 --> 01:51:50.093
<i>- That's it.</i>
- What do you mean?

01:51:50.176 --> 01:51:51.553
<i>He's gone.</i>

01:51:53.513 --> 01:51:54.639
<i>That's it.</i>

01:51:59.477 --> 01:52:02.272
I knew it! I can't fucking believe it.

01:52:12.699 --> 01:52:14.868
- What happened?
- They fucking whacked him.

01:52:14.951 --> 01:52:16.119
Fuck.

01:52:31.968 --> 01:52:33.636
Are you all right?

01:52:40.727 --> 01:52:43.271
<i>It was revenge for Billy Batts...</i>

01:52:43.354 --> 01:52:45.231
<i>and a lot of other things.</i>

01:52:45.315 --> 01:52:46.399
And that's that.

01:52:46.483 --> 01:52:48.985
<i>There was nothing we could do about it.</i>

01:52:49.152 --> 01:52:51.779
<i>Batts was a made man</i>
<i>and Tommy wasn't.</i>

01:52:52.405 --> 01:52:54.407
<i>We had to sit still and take it.</i>

01:52:54.491 --> 01:52:57.911
<i>It was among the Italians.</i>
<i>It was real greaseball shit.</i>

01:53:10.590 --> 01:53:12.467
<i>They even shot Tommy in the face...</i>

01:53:12.550 --> 01:53:16.054
<i>so his mother couldn't give him</i>
<i>an open coffin at the funeral.</i>

01:54:03.393 --> 01:54:06.896
<i>I was gonna be busy all day.</i>
<i>I had to drop off some guns at Jimmy's...</i>

01:54:06.980 --> 01:54:08.815
<i>to match some silencers he had.</i>

01:54:08.898 --> 01:54:11.985
<i>I had to pick up my brother at the hospital</i>
<i>and drive him home.</i>

01:54:12.068 --> 01:54:14.654
<i>I had to pick up</i>
<i>some new Pittsburgh stuff for Lois...</i>

01:54:14.737 --> 01:54:17.949
<i>to fly down to some customers</i>
<i>I had near Atlanta.</i>

01:54:29.210 --> 01:54:32.755
<i>Right away, I knew he didn't want them,</i>
<i>and I'd be stuck for the money.</i>

01:54:32.839 --> 01:54:36.551
<i>I only bought them because</i>
<i>he wanted them, and now he didn't.</i>

01:54:37.302 --> 01:54:40.847
What good are these? None of them fit.
What's the matter with you?

01:54:40.930 --> 01:54:42.223
I'm not paying for it.

01:54:42.307 --> 01:54:45.977
<i>I didn't say a thing. Jimmy was</i>
<i>so pissed off, he didn't even say goodbye.</i>

01:54:46.060 --> 01:54:48.396
Stop the drugs. They're making
your mind into mush!

01:54:48.480 --> 01:54:49.981
- You hear me?
- I'll take them back.

01:55:03.703 --> 01:55:05.705
<i>My Pittsburgh guys always wanted guns.</i>

01:55:05.788 --> 01:55:09.501
<i>Since I would see them in the afternoon</i>
<i>to pick up a delivery...</i>

01:55:09.584 --> 01:55:12.128
<i>I was pretty sure I'd get my money back.</i>

01:55:31.147 --> 01:55:32.315
Oh, my God.

01:55:34.067 --> 01:55:38.154
<i>When I finally got to the hospital,</i>
<i>Michael's doctor wanted to put me in bed.</i>

01:55:38.238 --> 01:55:40.448
Jesus Christ, what happened to you?

01:55:41.407 --> 01:55:43.827
I almost got into an accident
on the way here.

01:55:43.910 --> 01:55:46.913
<i>And I told him I was partying all night.</i>

01:55:46.996 --> 01:55:48.873
- I'm fine.
- Come on. Get over here.

01:55:48.957 --> 01:55:51.292
- Doc, I'm fine.
- Let me check you out.

01:55:51.584 --> 01:55:52.752
Come on.

01:55:55.755 --> 01:55:58.508
<i>He took mercy on me,</i>
<i>gave me 10 milligrams of Valium...</i>

01:55:58.591 --> 01:56:00.009
<i>and sent me home.</i>

01:56:00.426 --> 01:56:04.139
<i>My plan was to drop off my brother</i>
<i>at the house and pick up Karen.</i>

01:56:06.182 --> 01:56:09.352
There it is.
You see that helicopter right there?

01:56:09.435 --> 01:56:12.981
Right in front of us, there.
I think it's been following me all morning.

01:56:13.064 --> 01:56:15.984
- Get the fuck out. What are you, nuts?
- I'm telling you.

01:56:16.067 --> 01:56:17.360
I don't know what's going on.

01:56:17.443 --> 01:56:20.572
It's the third time I've seen it.
At the hospital I saw it.

01:56:20.655 --> 01:56:23.116
I had to make some stops.
I've seen it every time.

01:56:23.199 --> 01:56:26.077
I've been all over town
and I've seen it all day.

01:56:32.625 --> 01:56:34.210
<i>I was cooking dinner that night.</i>

01:56:35.462 --> 01:56:39.424
<i>I had to start braising the beef</i>
<i>and veal shanks for the tomato sauce.</i>

01:56:41.676 --> 01:56:44.846
<i>It was Michael's favorite.</i>
<i>I was making ziti with meat gravy...</i>

01:56:44.929 --> 01:56:47.640
<i>and I'm planning to roast some peppers</i>
<i>over the flames...</i>

01:56:47.724 --> 01:56:51.769
<i>put on some string beans with olive oil.</i>
<i>I had some beautiful cutlets...</i>

01:56:51.853 --> 01:56:52.979
<i>that were cut just right...</i>

01:56:53.062 --> 01:56:56.107
<i>that I was going to fry up as an appetizer.</i>

01:56:56.316 --> 01:56:58.401
<i>So, I was home for about an hour.</i>

01:56:58.485 --> 01:57:00.487
<i>My plan was to start the dinner early...</i>

01:57:00.570 --> 01:57:03.239
<i>so Karen and I could unload the guns</i>
<i>Jimmy didn't want...</i>

01:57:03.323 --> 01:57:04.782
<i>then get the package for Lois...</i>

01:57:04.866 --> 01:57:07.744
<i>to take to Atlanta for her trip</i>
<i>later that night.</i>

01:57:08.328 --> 01:57:12.290
<i>I kept looking out the window,</i>
<i>and I saw that the helicopter was gone.</i>

01:57:12.707 --> 01:57:16.628
Michael, keep an eye on the sauce.
Stay here with your Uncle Michael.

01:57:17.337 --> 01:57:21.299
<i>So I asked my brother to watch the sauce,</i>
<i>and Karen and I started out.</i>

01:57:24.010 --> 01:57:26.095
Oh, God. I see it.

01:57:26.346 --> 01:57:28.848
- I see it. Look, it's right there.
- Damn!

01:57:30.058 --> 01:57:31.559
- That's it.
- There it is.

01:57:31.643 --> 01:57:33.686
We got to get to your mother's.

01:57:33.895 --> 01:57:35.271
See, I told you.

01:57:35.355 --> 01:57:36.731
It's funny.

01:57:37.148 --> 01:57:40.693
- It's not the end of the world.
- We're going to your mother's.

01:58:08.429 --> 01:58:12.308
Go inside, tell your mother not to touch
anything outside the house. Nothing.

01:58:12.392 --> 01:58:15.270
We couldn't go to your mother's house?
You had to come here.

01:58:20.817 --> 01:58:22.527
Let's go shopping.

01:58:24.612 --> 01:58:26.823
I'm not nuts,
it's been following me all morning.

01:58:28.116 --> 01:58:29.492
I'm telling you.

01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:33.413
Fine. Fine. He thinks I'm paranoid!

01:58:34.497 --> 01:58:38.334
I should bring him the helicopter,
then we'll see how paranoid I am.

01:58:39.919 --> 01:58:41.754
Come on, let's go inside.

01:58:45.842 --> 01:58:47.719
- Yeah, it's gone.
- I don't hear anything.

01:58:47.802 --> 01:58:49.220
Let's go back to your mother's.

01:59:03.151 --> 01:59:05.737
- They all right?
- Beautiful. They're great.

01:59:06.571 --> 01:59:09.282
Didn't I tell you, you were paranoid?
Didn't I tell him?

01:59:09.365 --> 01:59:10.909
Yeah. I need a hit.

01:59:11.451 --> 01:59:14.913
Want to see helicopters?
Come on, I'll show you helicopters.

01:59:15.121 --> 01:59:18.166
I've seen enough helicopters for one day,
thank you.

01:59:18.625 --> 01:59:23.004
<i>I had to get home and get the package</i>
<i>ready for Lois to take on her trip.</i>

01:59:23.087 --> 01:59:27.091
<i>Also, I had to get to Sandy's to give</i>
<i>the package a whack with quinine.</i>

01:59:27.300 --> 01:59:29.636
<i>Plus, I knew Sandy would get on my ass.</i>

01:59:29.719 --> 01:59:33.515
<i>I had the cooking to finish,</i>
<i>and I had to get Lois ready for her trip.</i>

01:59:33.598 --> 01:59:36.643
- It's Sandy. What is this?
- She's a pain in the ass.

01:59:37.894 --> 01:59:39.646
<i>- When are you coming over?</i>
- In an hour.

01:59:39.729 --> 01:59:43.024
<i>- You staying tonight, right?</i>
- I can't. I got my brother tonight.

01:59:43.107 --> 01:59:47.153
Come on, stop.
We'll talk about it later, okay? Goodbye.

01:59:54.786 --> 01:59:56.788
- Hello?
<i>- It's me. You ready?</i>

01:59:57.789 --> 02:00:01.126
Tell Michael not to let the sauce stick.
Keep stirring it.

02:00:01.209 --> 02:00:05.130
- Henry says don't let the sauce stick.
- I'm stirring it.

02:00:05.213 --> 02:00:07.132
<i>- Listen, you know what to do?</i>
- Yeah, yeah.

02:00:07.215 --> 02:00:09.509
Don't "yeah, yeah" me, Lois.
This is important.

02:00:09.592 --> 02:00:12.137
Make sure you leave the house
when you make the call.

02:00:12.220 --> 02:00:15.473
Understand me?
Call from an outside line. I mean it.

02:00:15.557 --> 02:00:19.310
Jesus, you must think I'm dumb. Why
are you bugging me? I know what to do.

02:00:19.394 --> 02:00:22.105
You little hick, just make sure you do it.

02:00:22.188 --> 02:00:23.273
<i>You can be such a pain.</i>

02:00:23.356 --> 02:00:27.277
<i>- Hey! Just do it!</i>
- Okay.

02:00:28.027 --> 02:00:32.574
Un-fucking-believable. All of them.
Every fucking girl in my life.

02:00:33.908 --> 02:00:36.119
- What did he say?
- Nothing.

02:00:36.202 --> 02:00:38.580
<i>What does she do</i>
<i>after she hangs up with me?</i>

02:00:38.663 --> 02:00:42.250
<i>After everything I told her?</i>
<i>After all her "yeah, yeah"bullshit?</i>

02:00:42.333 --> 02:00:45.044
<i>She picks up the phone</i>
<i>and calls from the house.</i>

02:00:45.128 --> 02:00:47.505
<i>If anybody was listening,</i>
<i>they'd know everything.</i>

02:00:47.589 --> 02:00:49.632
<i>They'd know a package</i>
<i>was leaving my house...</i>

02:00:49.716 --> 02:00:53.303
<i>and they'd even have the time and</i>
<i>flight number, thanks to her.</i>

02:00:54.929 --> 02:00:56.890
<i>As soon as I got home, I started cooking.</i>

02:00:56.973 --> 02:00:59.142
<i>I had a few hours until Lois' flight.</i>

02:00:59.225 --> 02:01:01.394
<i>I told my brother to watch the stove.</i>

02:01:01.478 --> 02:01:05.231
<i>All day long the guy's been watching</i>
<i>helicopters and tomato sauce.</i>

02:01:06.065 --> 02:01:10.695
<i>I had to drive over to Sandy's,</i>
<i>mix the stuff, then get back to the gravy.</i>

02:01:21.873 --> 02:01:25.001
Do you think you can come over here,
fuck me, and leave?

02:01:25.084 --> 02:01:27.212
- Come on.
- You got someplace better to go?

02:01:27.295 --> 02:01:29.839
Don't talk like that. Come on.

02:01:30.215 --> 02:01:32.050
- You all right?
- Yeah, sure.

02:01:32.133 --> 02:01:33.426
You believe me?

02:01:34.594 --> 02:01:36.054
Do you believe me?

02:01:36.304 --> 02:01:37.764
Do you believe me?

02:01:39.724 --> 02:01:41.476
- That the last one?
- Yeah.

02:01:51.069 --> 02:01:53.404
You lying son of a bitch. I hate you!

02:02:00.119 --> 02:02:03.998
Please stop feeding the dog
from the table...

02:02:04.082 --> 02:02:06.417
from the plate on top of it. Stop it.

02:02:06.501 --> 02:02:08.920
- I have to.
- You don't have to.

02:02:13.842 --> 02:02:15.301
I got to go home.

02:02:17.345 --> 02:02:19.347
What do you mean, you got to go home?

02:02:19.430 --> 02:02:20.807
I've been carrying this all day.

02:02:20.890 --> 02:02:23.601
We got to start taping it to your leg.
We got to go soon.

02:02:23.685 --> 02:02:25.770
I got to go home and get my hat.

02:02:26.521 --> 02:02:29.149
Forget your fucking hat.
Are you kidding me?

02:02:29.315 --> 02:02:32.152
So I need a trip to Rockaway
because you want your hat?

02:02:32.235 --> 02:02:36.239
I need it, I got to have it.
It's my lucky hat. I never fly without it.

02:02:36.406 --> 02:02:40.410
Lois, do you understand
what we are involved in here?

02:02:40.869 --> 02:02:43.913
I don't care. I need my hat.
I won't fly without it.

02:02:48.835 --> 02:02:52.422
<i>What could I do if she insisted</i>
<i>I drive her home for her goddamn hat?</i>

02:02:52.505 --> 02:02:55.383
<i>I hid the package in the kitchen</i>
<i>and went to take her home.</i>

02:02:55.467 --> 02:02:56.593
A hat?

02:03:05.685 --> 02:03:07.312
What the fuck is this?

02:03:07.479 --> 02:03:10.106
Police! Freeze! Don't you move,
you motherfucker...

02:03:10.190 --> 02:03:13.318
or I'll blow your brains out.
Shut the car off slowly.

02:03:17.238 --> 02:03:19.324
<i>For a second, I thought I was dead.</i>

02:03:19.407 --> 02:03:21.993
<i>But when I heard all the noise,</i>
<i>I knew they were cops.</i>

02:03:22.076 --> 02:03:23.786
<i>Only cops talk that way.</i>

02:03:23.995 --> 02:03:25.205
Don't fucking move.

02:03:25.288 --> 02:03:28.792
<i>If they had been wiseguys,</i>
<i>I wouldn't have heard a thing.</i>

02:03:29.667 --> 02:03:31.377
<i>I would have been dead.</i>

02:03:32.337 --> 02:03:34.047
Michael, lock the door!

02:03:58.279 --> 02:04:01.282
Talk to me. When was the last time
you took a collar?

02:04:01.366 --> 02:04:03.034
Fuckhead, I'm talking to you.

02:04:03.117 --> 02:04:06.871
You don't want to say a fucking word,
don't. I don't really give a fuck.

02:04:06.955 --> 02:04:11.167
You'll do 25 years. See how much
of a good guy you'll be then.

02:04:11.251 --> 02:04:13.378
<i>All day I thought the guys</i>
<i>in the helicopter...</i>

02:04:13.461 --> 02:04:18.091
<i>were local cops busting my balls over</i>
<i>Lufthansa. They turned out to be narcs.</i>

02:04:18.174 --> 02:04:19.300
Just get the lawyer.

02:04:19.384 --> 02:04:23.054
<i>They'd been on me a month.</i>
<i>Phone taps, surveillance, everything.</i>

02:04:23.138 --> 02:04:25.890
You know the boys. All the pals are here.

02:04:25.974 --> 02:04:29.519
You don't want to talk to me,
you'll have a problem all night.

02:04:29.727 --> 02:04:33.690
Each one of these counts holds
25-to-life in New York State.

02:04:33.773 --> 02:04:38.361
Twenty-five fucking years, pal.
I'll slap your fucking head inside out.

02:04:39.112 --> 02:04:41.406
What, were you guys grocery shopping?

02:04:42.782 --> 02:04:46.619
Are we going to make a cake?
You going to make a fucking cake?

02:04:46.870 --> 02:04:49.038
You got anything good in there?

02:04:50.748 --> 02:04:51.916
Is it good?

02:04:56.921 --> 02:04:58.465
Bye-bye, dickhead.

02:05:01.593 --> 02:05:03.052
See you in Attica, dick.

02:05:03.636 --> 02:05:06.848
I spoke to Jimmy.
He offered to give me some money.

02:05:07.307 --> 02:05:10.727
He just wants to know what's happening.
He just wants to talk to you.

02:05:10.810 --> 02:05:12.312
Fuck Jimmy and his money.

02:05:12.395 --> 02:05:15.773
I got to straighten out everything
with Paulie or I'm dead.

02:05:16.399 --> 02:05:18.234
Then you're better off staying in here.

02:05:18.318 --> 02:05:21.946
They could whack me in here as easy
as outside, maybe even easier.

02:05:22.030 --> 02:05:23.781
They're afraid I'll rat them out.

02:05:23.865 --> 02:05:28.203
People are already walking away from me.
I'm dead in here. You got to get me out.

02:05:28.286 --> 02:05:32.957
<i>Karen finally got her mother to put</i>
<i>her house up for my bail and I was out.</i>

02:05:33.041 --> 02:05:37.170
<i>I remember I had this feeling</i>
<i>I would be killed right outside the jail.</i>

02:05:37.587 --> 02:05:40.840
<i>I knew Paulie was still pissed at me,</i>
<i>and he's such a hothead.</i>

02:05:40.924 --> 02:05:42.759
<i>And I was worried about Jimmy.</i>

02:05:42.842 --> 02:05:47.138
<i>See, Jimmy knew if Paulie found out</i>
<i>he was into drug deals with me...</i>

02:05:47.847 --> 02:05:50.892
<i>Paulie would have Jimmy whacked</i>
<i>even before me.</i>

02:05:52.602 --> 02:05:54.229
<i>This is the bad time.</i>

02:05:55.104 --> 02:05:57.357
<i>I didn't feel safe until I got home.</i>

02:05:59.192 --> 02:06:03.029
<i>Now my plan was to stay alive</i>
<i>long enough to sell off the dope...</i>

02:06:03.112 --> 02:06:07.700
<i>the cops never found, then disappear</i>
<i>until I can get things straightened out.</i>

02:06:09.285 --> 02:06:10.411
Fuck!

02:06:10.495 --> 02:06:14.249
- Where's the stuff I left, Karen?
- I flushed it down the toilet.

02:06:16.000 --> 02:06:17.085
You what?

02:06:17.544 --> 02:06:20.213
What was I supposed to do?
They were all over the house.

02:06:20.296 --> 02:06:24.467
That was worth $60,000!
I need that money! That's all we got!

02:06:24.551 --> 02:06:27.303
What was I supposed to do?
They had a search warrant!

02:06:27.387 --> 02:06:31.850
That's all the money we had! I was
depending on that! Why did you do that?

02:06:32.350 --> 02:06:35.228
I had to. They were going to find it!

02:06:35.311 --> 02:06:39.315
- They would have never found it!
- They would have, I swear to you!

02:06:40.733 --> 02:06:42.402
They would've found it!

02:06:43.862 --> 02:06:45.363
Why did you do that?

02:06:45.446 --> 02:06:49.033
- They would have found it.
- Why did you do that, Karen?

02:06:50.243 --> 02:06:52.203
Oh, my God!

02:06:52.662 --> 02:06:55.582
- I had to do it.
- Oh, my God.

02:07:31.743 --> 02:07:33.661
<i>Paulie, I'm really sorry.</i>

02:07:36.331 --> 02:07:39.167
I don't know what else to say.
I know I fucked up.

02:07:39.250 --> 02:07:40.919
Yeah, you fucked up.

02:07:44.589 --> 02:07:46.508
But I'm all right now.

02:07:48.092 --> 02:07:52.514
I can be trusted now. I'm clean.
On my kids, I'm clean.

02:07:52.597 --> 02:07:54.933
You looked in my eyes and lied to me.

02:07:56.100 --> 02:07:58.269
You treated me like a fucking jerk.

02:07:58.853 --> 02:08:00.438
Like I was never nothing to you.

02:08:00.522 --> 02:08:03.399
After what you said,
I couldn't come to you.

02:08:04.526 --> 02:08:06.903
You know, I was ashamed.

02:08:09.948 --> 02:08:11.908
I'm ashamed now.

02:08:15.245 --> 02:08:17.580
But I got nowhere else to go, Paulie.

02:08:20.625 --> 02:08:24.963
You're all I've got.
And I really need your help. I really do.

02:08:31.136 --> 02:08:32.220
Take this.

02:08:47.277 --> 02:08:49.779
And now I've got to turn my back on you.

02:08:59.789 --> 02:09:01.458
<i>$3,200.</i>

02:09:02.041 --> 02:09:06.045
<i>That's what he gave me.</i>
<i>$3,200 for a lifetime.</i>

02:09:06.963 --> 02:09:09.299
<i>It wasn't even enough to pay for the coffin.</i>

02:09:09.382 --> 02:09:11.468
<i>- We got to get out.</i>
<i>- I don't want to run.</i>

02:09:11.551 --> 02:09:15.972
I don't want to. Am I supposed to pick up
and leave everything? Go hiding?

02:09:16.389 --> 02:09:18.975
I don't want to do that.
Is that what you want?

02:09:19.058 --> 02:09:21.227
If we stay around here, we're dead.

02:09:21.978 --> 02:09:23.813
You got it? We're dead.

02:09:24.481 --> 02:09:25.732
They're right.

02:09:26.065 --> 02:09:29.319
You took too much of that stuff.
You're totally paranoid.

02:09:32.530 --> 02:09:34.491
How's he doing? Busting his balls or what?

02:09:34.574 --> 02:09:35.700
He's okay.

02:09:36.826 --> 02:09:38.369
They sobered him up.

02:09:38.578 --> 02:09:40.747
Good. Very good. Glad to hear it.

02:09:44.542 --> 02:09:47.003
You know what kind of questions
they're asking him?

02:09:47.086 --> 02:09:48.713
Jimmy, I don't know.

02:09:49.798 --> 02:09:53.343
I got my mind on so many other things.
I got no money...

02:09:53.885 --> 02:09:56.554
The girls are old enough
to read the newspapers.

02:09:56.638 --> 02:09:58.848
Tell him he's got to call me. Okay?

02:09:59.557 --> 02:10:03.186
As soon as you talk to him,
he's got to call me. It's important.

02:10:03.520 --> 02:10:07.190
He doesn't know I came here to see you.
It's like he's crazy.

02:10:07.273 --> 02:10:10.443
- Take this. It's a couple of thousands.
- Thanks, Jimmy.

02:10:10.610 --> 02:10:12.612
Don't worry, everything will be all right.

02:10:12.695 --> 02:10:16.032
I got some beautiful Dior dresses.
You want to have them?

02:10:16.282 --> 02:10:18.159
Pick out a few for yourself.

02:10:18.952 --> 02:10:20.870
- For my mom.
- Yeah, whatever.

02:10:21.037 --> 02:10:23.790
No. It's over here.
In the store on the corner.

02:10:23.873 --> 02:10:26.459
It's swag, so I got it down on the corner.

02:10:32.257 --> 02:10:34.134
Go ahead, sweetheart, I'll see you.

02:10:34.217 --> 02:10:36.052
- Thanks, Jimmy.
- Don't worry.

02:10:36.136 --> 02:10:38.847
- I'll try.
- Don't forget, he's got to call me.

02:10:41.349 --> 02:10:43.560
- Over here?
- Right down there.

02:10:58.575 --> 02:11:00.618
It's over there, on the corner.

02:11:00.910 --> 02:11:02.203
Right there.

02:11:36.404 --> 02:11:38.615
No, go ahead. It's right in there.

02:11:38.698 --> 02:11:40.783
No, Jimmy. I'm in a hurry!

02:11:41.117 --> 02:11:43.995
My mom's watching the kids!
I got to get home!

02:11:44.078 --> 02:11:45.622
I'll come back later!

02:12:08.061 --> 02:12:09.687
Karen!

02:12:14.192 --> 02:12:15.443
What happened?

02:12:16.653 --> 02:12:17.779
Nothing.

02:12:18.279 --> 02:12:20.448
- What happened?
- I just got scared.

02:12:23.660 --> 02:12:24.911
Got the keys?

02:12:26.579 --> 02:12:30.291
- What happened, Karen?
- I just got scared. It's okay.

02:12:30.375 --> 02:12:32.127
- Are you all right?
- Yeah.

02:12:38.883 --> 02:12:43.471
<i>If you're part of a crew, nobody ever</i>
<i>tells you they're going to kill you.</i>

02:12:44.013 --> 02:12:45.849
<i>It doesn't happen that way.</i>

02:12:45.932 --> 02:12:49.435
<i>There aren't any arguments</i>
<i>or curses like in the movies.</i>

02:12:49.519 --> 02:12:53.690
<i>Your murderers come with smiles.</i>
<i>They come as your friends.</i>

02:12:53.773 --> 02:12:55.859
<i>People who cared for you all your life.</i>

02:12:55.942 --> 02:13:00.363
<i>They always seem to come when you're</i>
<i>weakest and most in need of their help.</i>

02:13:00.697 --> 02:13:03.950
<i>So I met Jimmy in a crowded place</i>
<i>we both knew.</i>

02:13:04.325 --> 02:13:08.329
<i>I got there 15 minutes early,</i>
<i>and Jimmy was already there.</i>

02:13:08.746 --> 02:13:13.168
<i>He took the booth near the window</i>
<i>so he could see everyone who drove up.</i>

02:13:13.501 --> 02:13:15.879
<i>He wanted to make sure I wasn't tailed.</i>

02:13:16.296 --> 02:13:19.174
<i>He was jumpy. He hadn't touched a thing.</i>

02:13:20.216 --> 02:13:23.303
<i>On the surface,</i>
<i>everything was supposed to be fine.</i>

02:13:23.386 --> 02:13:25.805
<i>We were supposed to be discussing</i>
<i>my case.</i>

02:13:25.889 --> 02:13:30.852
<i>But I had a feeling Jimmy was trying</i>
<i>to sense if I'd rat on him to save my neck.</i>

02:13:32.520 --> 02:13:36.232
I been telling you your whole life,
don't talk on the phone.

02:13:36.441 --> 02:13:38.234
Now you understand?

02:13:40.904 --> 02:13:44.449
It's going to be okay.
You got a good chance to beat the case.

02:13:47.410 --> 02:13:51.664
You know that kid from the city
we were talking about? You know?

02:13:54.083 --> 02:13:58.630
The kid turned out to be a rat. As soon as
he got pinched, he ratted on everybody.

02:14:01.090 --> 02:14:03.343
I know where he is. He's hiding now.

02:14:04.928 --> 02:14:06.513
Know what I'm saying?

02:14:11.267 --> 02:14:14.938
Would you have a problem going
with Anthony to take care of that?

02:14:17.524 --> 02:14:18.775
No, not at all.

02:14:20.401 --> 02:14:22.195
That way they got nothing.

02:14:30.829 --> 02:14:33.748
<i>Jimmy had never asked me</i>
<i>to whack somebody before.</i>

02:14:34.040 --> 02:14:37.794
<i>But now he's asking me to go to Florida</i>
<i>and do a hit with Anthony.</i>

02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:49.055
<i>That's when I knew I would never</i>
<i>have come back from Florida alive.</i>

02:15:02.986 --> 02:15:06.322
Whenever you move me,
I asked once and I'll tell you again...

02:15:06.406 --> 02:15:08.575
I don't want to go any place cold.

02:15:09.284 --> 02:15:11.703
You don't have a choice in that matter.

02:15:11.828 --> 02:15:14.372
Come on. Whoever fucking controls it...

02:15:15.165 --> 02:15:17.876
just no place cold. Do that for me.
I'm trying to...

02:15:17.959 --> 02:15:19.794
He's bronchial, that's why.

02:15:19.878 --> 02:15:22.505
If he's legitimately bronchial,
we'll consider that.

02:15:22.589 --> 02:15:24.883
I'd like to go someplace not cold.

02:15:24.966 --> 02:15:28.720
Can I ask you some questions?
What about my parents?

02:15:29.721 --> 02:15:30.889
What about them?

02:15:30.972 --> 02:15:33.975
Am I going to see them?
Am I going to talk to them?

02:15:34.726 --> 02:15:37.353
Don't I have some kind of contact
with them?

02:15:37.812 --> 02:15:38.897
No.

02:15:39.981 --> 02:15:43.318
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.
You mean to tell me that...

02:15:43.693 --> 02:15:47.780
God forbid something happens to my
parents, they get sick, I can't see them?

02:15:47.864 --> 02:15:50.867
Maybe something can be worked out
if they're sick...

02:15:51.367 --> 02:15:53.578
if there's extraordinary circumstances...

02:15:53.661 --> 02:15:56.539
I can't do this. I can't do this, Henry.

02:15:57.665 --> 02:15:59.417
I can't leave my parents.

02:16:00.668 --> 02:16:02.879
Excuse me, Karen, I told you before.

02:16:04.130 --> 02:16:07.675
I'm not going to do this
unless you and the kids come with me.

02:16:09.469 --> 02:16:11.262
I can't do it without you.

02:16:11.554 --> 02:16:15.642
So, you do whatever, but... that's it.

02:16:17.185 --> 02:16:19.896
- You need Henry, not me, right?
- That's right.

02:16:20.063 --> 02:16:22.690
Frankly, I don't care
whether you go or not.

02:16:22.816 --> 02:16:26.152
If it'll make him a better witness,
I'd like you to be with him.

02:16:26.236 --> 02:16:28.029
They want Henry, not me.

02:16:28.112 --> 02:16:31.616
Henry'll be in the protection program.
They can't get to him.

02:16:32.116 --> 02:16:35.620
They can only get to him
by getting to you or your kids.

02:16:35.702 --> 02:16:38.206
If he goes into the program,
you're in danger...

02:16:38.289 --> 02:16:40.791
- I don't know anything.
- Don't give me...

02:16:40.875 --> 02:16:42.334
the babe-in-the-woods routine.

02:16:42.418 --> 02:16:47.090
I've listened to those wiretaps,
and I've heard you talk about cocaine.

02:16:47.173 --> 02:16:50.843
<i>Conversation after conversation</i>
<i>you talked to Henry on the phone.</i>

02:16:55.639 --> 02:16:57.767
It doesn't matter.
Whether he goes to jail...

02:16:57.851 --> 02:17:01.312
or stays on the streets and beats the case,
he's a dead man.

02:17:01.896 --> 02:17:03.815
He knows it and you know it.

02:17:05.275 --> 02:17:07.026
What about the kids and school?

02:17:07.110 --> 02:17:09.654
<i>Will they get left back?</i>
<i>I mean, what goes on?</i>

02:17:09.736 --> 02:17:12.198
Go to Wall Street and get real crooks.

02:17:12.323 --> 02:17:14.784
Whoever sold you those suits
had a sense of humor.

02:17:14.993 --> 02:17:18.037
What it comes down to is
we're your only salvation.

02:17:18.871 --> 02:17:22.625
We'll save your life and his life,
and we'll keep you out of jail.

02:17:26.546 --> 02:17:29.257
<i>This morning you told the jury</i>
<i>about your background.</i>

02:17:29.340 --> 02:17:31.425
<i>It was easy for us to disappear.</i>

02:17:31.718 --> 02:17:33.928
<i>My house</i>
<i>was in my mother-in-law's name.</i>

02:17:34.012 --> 02:17:36.055
<i>My cars were registered to my wife.</i>

02:17:36.138 --> 02:17:39.642
<i>My Social Security cards</i>
<i>and driver's licenses were phonies.</i>

02:17:39.767 --> 02:17:42.102
<i>I never voted or paid taxes.</i>

02:17:42.687 --> 02:17:47.233
<i>My birth certificate and arrest sheet was</i>
<i>all you'd ever have to know I was alive.</i>

02:17:47.316 --> 02:17:49.986
- Do you see him here in this courtroom?
- Yes.

02:17:50.278 --> 02:17:52.906
Will you please point him out for the jury?

02:17:55.282 --> 02:17:59.913
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, James Conway.

02:18:01.039 --> 02:18:04.125
Do you also know a man
named Paul Cicero?

02:18:04.459 --> 02:18:06.835
- Do you see him in the courtroom?
- Yes.

02:18:07.045 --> 02:18:09.254
Can you point him out for the jury?

02:18:10.924 --> 02:18:15.136
Let the record reflect that Mr. Hill
identified the defendant, Paul Cicero.

02:18:16.346 --> 02:18:18.138
Your Honor, I have a document...

02:18:18.223 --> 02:18:20.642
<i>The hardest thing was leaving the life.</i>

02:18:21.392 --> 02:18:23.019
<i>I still love the life.</i>

02:18:23.311 --> 02:18:25.480
<i>We were treated like movie stars</i>
<i>with muscle.</i>

02:18:25.563 --> 02:18:27.732
<i>We had it all, just for the asking.</i>

02:18:27.816 --> 02:18:31.152
<i>Our wives, mothers, kids,</i>
<i>everybody rode along.</i>

02:18:31.486 --> 02:18:34.697
<i>I had paper bags filled with jewelry</i>
<i>stashed in the kitchen.</i>

02:18:34.781 --> 02:18:37.157
<i>I had a sugar bowl full of coke</i>
<i>next to the bed.</i>

02:18:37.242 --> 02:18:41.120
People call them rats because rats do
anything to survive. Isn't that right?

02:18:41.204 --> 02:18:43.331
- Objection!
- Objection sustained.

02:18:43.414 --> 02:18:46.584
- I know nothing about being a rat.
- You know everything about it.

02:18:47.418 --> 02:18:49.003
Objection, Your Honor.
In view of the violence...

02:18:49.087 --> 02:18:51.380
<i>Anything I wanted was a phone call away.</i>

02:18:51.464 --> 02:18:55.009
<i>Free cars. Keys to a dozen hideout flats</i>
<i>all over the city.</i>

02:18:55.093 --> 02:18:57.679
<i>I'd bet $20,000, $30,000 over a weekend...</i>

02:18:57.762 --> 02:19:01.933
<i>then blow the winnings in a week</i>
<i>or go to the sharks to pay the bookies.</i>

02:19:02.100 --> 02:19:03.518
It didn't matter.

02:19:03.852 --> 02:19:08.731
It didn't mean anything. When I was broke
I would go out and rob some more.

02:19:09.148 --> 02:19:10.608
We ran everything.

02:19:11.066 --> 02:19:15.362
We paid off cops. We paid off lawyers.
We paid off judges.

02:19:15.612 --> 02:19:19.117
Everybody had their hands out.
Everything was for the taking.

02:19:21.161 --> 02:19:22.787
And now it's all over.

02:19:23.580 --> 02:19:25.290
<i>That's the hardest part.</i>

02:19:26.040 --> 02:19:27.709
<i>Today everything is different.</i>

02:19:27.791 --> 02:19:32.004
<i>There's no action.</i>
<i>I have to wait around like everyone else.</i>

02:19:32.379 --> 02:19:34.174
<i>Can't even get decent food.</i>

02:19:34.924 --> 02:19:38.136
<i>After I got here I ordered spaghetti</i>
<i>with marinara sauce...</i>

02:19:38.218 --> 02:19:40.388
<i>and I got egg noodles and ketchup.</i>

02:19:40.888 --> 02:19:42.514
<i>I'm an average nobody.</i>

02:19:43.766 --> 02:19:46.644
<i>I get to live the rest of my life</i>
<i>like a schnook.</i>
