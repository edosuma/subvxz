00:02.602 --> 00:04.673
<i> Previously on</i> this is us...
My water just broke.
Yep.

00:04.672 --> 00:06.471
First male is out.
You hear that, babe?

00:06.474 --> 00:07.944
We got a boy.
Something's... not right...

00:07.942 --> 00:09.812
Your wife is in distress, Jack.

00:09.810 --> 00:11.040
I found him.
I found him.

00:11.045 --> 00:12.005
Randall peasing.

00:12.013 --> 00:13.653
I'm your biological son.

00:13.647 --> 00:14.977
Toby.
Kate.

00:14.982 --> 00:16.122
So, you want to be fat friends?

00:17.318 --> 00:19.148
This show is so bad!

00:19.153 --> 00:20.493
Everything's fake!

00:20.488 --> 00:21.948
I quit.

00:21.956 --> 00:23.186
We lost the third baby, Jack.

00:23.190 --> 00:24.560
I'm very sorry.

00:24.558 --> 00:27.058
<i> I like to think that you took</i>

00:27.061 --> 00:28.961
<i> the sourest lemon</i>
<i> that life has to offer</i>

00:28.963 --> 00:31.563

00:48.916 --> 00:50.346
guys, breakfast!

00:50.351 --> 00:52.051
Let's go!

00:54.989 --> 00:56.719
Mom, Webster told me
to shut up.

00:56.724 --> 00:58.694
Shut up!
- Do not call him that.

00:58.692 --> 01:00.192
Everyone else always does.

01:00.194 --> 01:02.194
I don't care
what everybody else does.

01:02.196 --> 01:04.355
Randall is your little brother;
You have to have his back.

01:04.364 --> 01:05.595
No, sweetheart.
No, no, no.

01:05.599 --> 01:07.029
Your breakfast
is over there, Kate.

01:07.034 --> 01:08.734
Thank you.

01:09.703 --> 01:11.903
Baby, we talked about this.

01:11.906 --> 01:13.666
Morning.

01:13.674 --> 01:14.974
Good morning.

01:17.011 --> 01:18.311
Yuck.

01:20.448 --> 01:21.708
Jack!

01:21.715 --> 01:23.575
It's fine.
It's fine.

01:23.584 --> 01:25.184
Did you get fruit?

01:25.186 --> 01:26.686
Yes.

01:27.688 --> 01:29.148
Hey.

01:30.624 --> 01:32.094
Do you need me to show you
where the coffee is?

01:32.093 --> 01:33.733
Oh, I know where the coffee is.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.357
Okay.

01:35.362 --> 01:36.602
Good.

01:36.597 --> 01:38.097
Just give me...

01:38.099 --> 01:39.359
Okay.

01:39.366 --> 01:41.026
Dad's off.
Deep breaths.

01:41.035 --> 01:42.795
And...

01:42.803 --> 01:45.043
First came...
Me!

01:45.039 --> 01:46.939
And dad said...
Gee!

01:46.941 --> 01:47.941
And then came...
Me!

01:47.942 --> 01:48.942
And mom said...
Whee!

01:48.943 --> 01:50.443
And then came...
Me.

01:50.444 --> 01:52.144
And we said...
That's three.

01:52.146 --> 01:54.876
Big three?
- Big three!

02:00.054 --> 02:02.254
Do you need me to show you
where my mouth is?

02:02.256 --> 02:03.786
No.

02:03.791 --> 02:05.321
I know where it is.

02:05.326 --> 02:07.156
Oh.

02:07.161 --> 02:08.491
Good.

02:12.600 --> 02:13.900
Bye.
Bye.

02:15.970 --> 02:17.240
Kate,

02:17.238 --> 02:18.468
all the fruit,
please.

02:18.472 --> 02:21.512
* Both dirty, both mean *

02:21.509 --> 02:24.279
* yes, and the dream
was just the same *

02:24.278 --> 02:26.278
* and I dreamed
your dream for you *

02:26.280 --> 02:29.480
* and now your dream is real *

02:29.483 --> 02:31.453
* how can you look at me *
good job.

02:31.452 --> 02:33.292
* As if I was just another one
of your deals? *

02:33.287 --> 02:36.117
* when you can fall for... *

02:36.123 --> 02:39.423
you know, I just did bi's, tri's
and left testicle.

02:39.426 --> 02:42.586
I'm really starting to get
some definition on that guy.

02:42.596 --> 02:44.156
Not funny.
It's fun...

02:44.165 --> 02:45.425
It's not funny.
Come on.
Come on, can we go?

02:45.432 --> 02:46.502
We've been here
long enough.

02:46.500 --> 02:48.300
No...
Kate. Come on, Kate...

02:48.302 --> 02:49.602
Come on.

02:52.673 --> 02:55.213
How are you losing weight
and I'm not?

02:57.478 --> 02:58.708
Can I be honest with you?

02:58.712 --> 03:00.482
Yeah, please.

03:00.481 --> 03:02.111
I think I'm just taking this

03:02.116 --> 03:04.046
more seriously than you are.

03:06.387 --> 03:08.517
Come on. Let's go.

03:09.390 --> 03:11.560
Worst place in the world!

03:24.505 --> 03:25.965
baby?

03:25.973 --> 03:27.273
Yeah.

03:28.709 --> 03:31.139
I want to ask you
something, but...

03:31.145 --> 03:33.805
I'm not sure how to say it.

03:33.814 --> 03:36.014
Since when do we censor
ourselves with each other?

03:36.016 --> 03:37.716
No, I know, it's...

03:37.718 --> 03:40.388
You know, Beth, we've been
together for 17 years.

03:40.387 --> 03:42.387
That's almost
half our lives.

03:42.389 --> 03:44.489
I know your face,

03:44.491 --> 03:47.261
your hands, your soul

03:47.261 --> 03:49.561
better than I know my own.

03:49.563 --> 03:51.763
You don't have
to censor yourself.

03:51.765 --> 03:53.695
Ever. Not with me.

03:53.701 --> 03:55.401
What was your question?

03:55.402 --> 03:58.942
How long is your crack-addict
biological daddy

03:58.939 --> 04:01.269
gonna be sleeping in our
six-year-old daughter's bedroom?

04:02.509 --> 04:04.279
Damn.
I know, right?

04:04.278 --> 04:05.578
You need to censor yourself,
woman.

04:05.579 --> 04:07.249
It's just got real.

04:08.849 --> 04:11.679
But Randall, he's been here
for three days.

04:11.685 --> 04:14.585
And the girls still think
he's your 70-year-old co-worker

04:14.588 --> 04:16.788
who likes sleepovers.

04:16.790 --> 04:18.860
What's our endgame here?

04:18.858 --> 04:22.529
Beth, the man has
stage 4 stomach cancer.

04:22.529 --> 04:25.459
I'm just trying to get him to
his first doctor's appointment,

04:25.466 --> 04:27.396
make sure he's gonna
make it past Thursday.

04:27.401 --> 04:30.401
Then we can take
the rest from there.

04:30.404 --> 04:32.604
Okay?

04:32.606 --> 04:33.866
Yeah.

04:33.874 --> 04:35.274
Okay.

04:41.382 --> 04:43.952
And he's a <i> former</i>
crack addict, by the way.

04:43.951 --> 04:45.951
Oh, well, then
he can stay forever.

04:45.953 --> 04:47.993
See? You didn't even
think about that.

04:50.824 --> 04:52.494
* *
so now Rebecca's all worked up

04:52.493 --> 04:53.963
because the kids at school

04:53.961 --> 04:56.431
are calling him "Webster."

04:56.430 --> 04:57.900
You know, the black kid

04:57.898 --> 04:59.298
the white family
adopts on that show?

04:59.300 --> 05:01.000
I love that show.
Yeah.

05:03.337 --> 05:05.097
I don't know.

05:05.105 --> 05:07.065
I don't know, Miguel,
it's just...

05:07.074 --> 05:10.644
It's hard to see the woman
i married sometimes, you know?

05:19.153 --> 05:20.823
what?

05:20.821 --> 05:22.991
Nothing.
Nothing.

05:22.990 --> 05:24.490
Nothing. You...
I'm your, I'm your best friend.

05:24.491 --> 05:26.161
You're venting.

05:26.160 --> 05:28.960
Best friends let best friends
vent without judgment.

05:28.962 --> 05:31.302
I'm not even gonna say anything
about it being 5:03

05:31.298 --> 05:32.958
and that being
your second bourbon.

05:32.966 --> 05:34.496
I appreciate that.

05:34.501 --> 05:36.841
The thing is...

05:36.837 --> 05:39.337
Your wife is, like,
the gold standard of wives.

05:39.340 --> 05:41.470
I know, Miguel.
I mean, she's smart,

05:41.475 --> 05:44.105
funny, beautiful,

05:44.111 --> 05:46.711
great personality,
greater ass...
Easy.

05:46.714 --> 05:50.184
She's raising not one, not two,
but three eight-year-olds

05:50.184 --> 05:53.124
while you sit here
drinking not one, not two,

05:53.120 --> 05:56.150
but soon to be three bourbons
by 5:05.

05:56.156 --> 05:57.516
I know all this, Miguel.

05:57.524 --> 05:59.364
Yeah?
Yeah.

05:59.360 --> 06:01.160
Because as your
loyal best friend,

06:01.161 --> 06:02.691
it is my duty to remind you

06:02.696 --> 06:03.956
of what you've
got there.

06:03.964 --> 06:05.534
You married way,

06:05.532 --> 06:08.702
<i> way</i> above your station.

06:08.702 --> 06:12.402
I'd be careful not to give her
a reason to notice.

06:15.743 --> 06:17.813
Oh, my father, he wasn't
a very nice man.

06:17.811 --> 06:19.211
He wasn't like your father.

06:19.213 --> 06:20.483
Why not?

06:20.481 --> 06:23.651
Well, your father,
he's good.

06:23.650 --> 06:25.180
He doesn't have vices.

06:25.185 --> 06:26.745
You know what a vice is?

06:28.055 --> 06:29.885
A vice is like a bad habit,

06:29.890 --> 06:32.320
like bitin' your nails,
but worse.

06:32.326 --> 06:34.486
Like drugs?
Yeah, that's right.

06:34.495 --> 06:36.325
That was my vice.

06:36.330 --> 06:37.900
Where would you get drugs?

06:37.898 --> 06:40.368
Well, that's an interesting
question, Tess.

06:40.367 --> 06:42.527
Let's see...

06:42.536 --> 06:44.836
Well, the cocaine
i used to...
That's good.
Okay, kids.

06:44.838 --> 06:45.838
Let's get ready
for school, okay?

06:45.839 --> 06:47.069
Come on.

06:47.074 --> 06:48.844
Hey, so I got
good news.

06:48.842 --> 06:50.282
I got you an appointment

06:50.277 --> 06:51.907
with an immunotherapy
specialist.

06:51.912 --> 06:54.052
Oh, that's not necessary.
No, it was nothing.

06:54.047 --> 06:55.777
Guy at my firm had an in.

06:55.783 --> 06:58.353
This guy is doing some
really ground-breaking stuff.

06:58.352 --> 06:59.752
Thank you; That's very kind.

06:59.753 --> 07:01.423
You got it.

07:01.422 --> 07:03.562
Oh, hey, come on, baby.

07:03.557 --> 07:05.557
I need you to take one big,
deep breath for me, okay?

07:07.528 --> 07:08.888
Oh, that's good.

07:08.896 --> 07:10.596
All right.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.127
My vice is asthma.

07:13.133 --> 07:14.573
His is cocaine.

07:14.568 --> 07:15.868
All right,
so let's get our jackets.

07:15.869 --> 07:17.369
Okay.
Go and get your coat.

07:17.371 --> 07:19.441
Honey, here,
take your lunch. Okay.

07:19.440 --> 07:22.110
Here you go.

07:22.109 --> 07:23.639
Hey, I'm sorry.

07:23.644 --> 07:25.144
I know they're too young
to talk about cocaine.

07:25.145 --> 07:26.605
I just...

07:26.613 --> 07:28.383
I feel like six is a hair young
for cocaine...

07:28.382 --> 07:30.322
Yeah, but seven...
We let them try it at seven.

07:30.317 --> 07:32.247
Um, so...

07:32.252 --> 07:33.822
What are you up to
today, William?

07:33.821 --> 07:36.791
Oh, nothing much.
The usual.

07:36.790 --> 07:40.590
I've really enjoyed being here.

07:40.594 --> 07:43.464
Being around those girls--
it fills me in a way...

07:43.464 --> 07:46.164
In a way I surely
don't deserve, so...

07:46.166 --> 07:48.766
I hope you'll let me know
when I've overstayed my welcome.

07:48.769 --> 07:50.169
You know,
don't be silly.

07:50.170 --> 07:52.570
We're happy to have you.

07:52.573 --> 07:54.973
Uh...

07:54.975 --> 07:57.135
I was wondering
if I could be so forward

07:57.144 --> 07:59.984
as to ask you for a few dollars
for the bus.

07:59.980 --> 08:02.480
Oh, sure. Sure.

08:05.419 --> 08:07.789
Where you going?

08:07.788 --> 08:10.258
Oh, you know,
just around.

08:18.832 --> 08:21.032
* Now because I'm so fly,
they just get to know why *

08:21.034 --> 08:23.544
* got to stick to what
i do best, I'm like "oh, hi" *

08:23.537 --> 08:26.537
* we've been trying to do
soft tens with aloha, aloha... *

08:30.377 --> 08:32.376
Victor. My man.

08:32.379 --> 08:33.708
How you been?

08:33.714 --> 08:35.884
I've been Hector.
Right on. Yeah.

08:35.883 --> 08:37.653
Yeah, and I'm sorry.
I got a lot on my mind.

08:37.650 --> 08:39.821
I don't know if you heard
the news. I left the show.

08:39.820 --> 08:41.650
Yeah. I'm gonna meet
with the team today.

08:41.655 --> 08:43.855
You know, we're gonna
strategize, talk next steps.

08:43.857 --> 08:45.687
Lots to figure out,
lots to talk about.

08:45.692 --> 08:48.292
It's exciting. Exciting times
for everyone involved.

08:52.332 --> 08:54.702
Kevin,

08:54.701 --> 08:56.801
do you remember where
you were when I found you?

08:56.803 --> 08:59.343
Yeah, sure. I was, uh,
in an improv comedy troupe.

08:59.339 --> 09:00.709
That's right.

09:00.707 --> 09:03.007
And when I saw your first show,

09:03.010 --> 09:05.310
do you know what I thought
to myself, Kevin?

09:05.312 --> 09:07.852
No, i-i...
I thought

09:07.848 --> 09:10.748
to myself... I've done it.

09:10.751 --> 09:12.521
I have found

09:12.519 --> 09:16.249
the least funny person
on the entire planet.

09:16.256 --> 09:17.686
Okay.

09:17.691 --> 09:19.931
But I saw
something there,

09:19.927 --> 09:21.887
so I took you on.

09:21.895 --> 09:23.895
And I got you the commercials,

09:23.897 --> 09:25.197
got you the soaps,

09:25.198 --> 09:27.368
eventually got you
a job paying you

09:27.367 --> 09:29.827
almost three million dollars
a year,

09:29.836 --> 09:33.766
making you so famous
that you could wear a ski cap

09:33.774 --> 09:35.914
when it is 80 degrees outside,

09:35.909 --> 09:38.239
and no one would say
a damn thing.

09:38.245 --> 09:39.675
Okay, lanie...

09:39.680 --> 09:41.250
Take off that hat.

09:42.416 --> 09:45.246
Okay.

09:45.252 --> 09:47.552
What's done is done, right?

09:47.554 --> 09:50.024
I mean, you know,
can't we just...

09:50.023 --> 09:52.193
Move on?

09:52.192 --> 09:54.632
Brian... speak.

09:56.530 --> 09:59.300
You're contractually bound to
the show for another two years.

09:59.299 --> 10:01.099
Okay.

10:01.101 --> 10:03.471
All right, and if I refuse?

10:07.474 --> 10:09.614
Listen to me very
carefully, Kevin.

10:09.610 --> 10:11.610
The network owns you.

10:11.612 --> 10:13.552
They can sue you for damages.

10:13.547 --> 10:15.047
They could bankrupt you.

10:15.048 --> 10:17.118
And even if someone
slipped a chill pill

10:17.117 --> 10:18.647
into their collective drink,

10:18.652 --> 10:20.892
you would still be
legally unable to work

10:20.887 --> 10:23.557
for the next two years.

10:23.557 --> 10:26.587
That's for any
studio, any network.

10:26.593 --> 10:28.563
Television or film.

10:28.562 --> 10:30.962
So...

10:30.964 --> 10:33.904
That's the good news.

10:33.900 --> 10:36.370
Now here's the part
you're not gonna like.

10:37.971 --> 10:40.411
<i> She's throwing this big...</i>

10:40.407 --> 10:41.937
Hollywood party
at her house tonight, right?

10:41.942 --> 10:43.812
The network president's
gonna be there, everyone.

10:43.810 --> 10:46.180
I'm supposed to show up,
get down on my hands and knees

10:46.179 --> 10:47.609
and beg to be the Manny again.

10:47.614 --> 10:49.584
Yeah.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.153
They own me, sis.

10:52.152 --> 10:53.492
I don't know what I'm gonna do.

10:53.487 --> 10:56.487
Well, I do, and
you did it already.

10:56.490 --> 10:58.660
Do you need me to show you
the video on YouTube?

10:58.659 --> 11:00.489
No.

11:00.494 --> 11:04.934
Kevin, I've known you
your whole life.

11:04.931 --> 11:08.801
Well, except for those two
minutes at the beginning.

11:08.802 --> 11:11.872
You've succeed at
everything you've ever tried.

11:11.872 --> 11:14.012
So here's what's
gonna happen.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.707
Okay? You're gonna
go to that party,

11:16.710 --> 11:18.640
and you're gonna march up
to that network guy,

11:18.645 --> 11:21.145
and you're gonna
tell him, "Manny out!"

11:21.148 --> 11:22.808
Mm-hmm.
Manny out?

11:22.816 --> 11:24.446
Manny out. Manny out!

11:24.451 --> 11:26.991
Well, you're not supposed
to say the... okay.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.517
Manny out!
That's good.

11:32.659 --> 11:34.629
Let me ask you
a question.
Mm.

11:34.628 --> 11:37.998
What did I ever do those first
two minutes without you?

11:37.998 --> 11:40.898
Oh, you cried, and
you crapped a lot.

11:40.901 --> 11:44.741
Sounds about right. Yeah.

11:44.738 --> 11:46.868
So you're coming to the party,
though, tonight with me, right?

11:46.873 --> 11:48.813
The fancy Hollywood party?
Yeah. Yeah.

11:48.809 --> 11:50.209
No, I'm not.
Yeah.

11:50.210 --> 11:51.910
Kevin, I... okay, f...

11:51.912 --> 11:53.882
I don't even have
anything to wear.
Kate.

11:53.880 --> 11:58.650
I need you there, okay?

11:58.652 --> 12:00.652
It's gonna be fun.

12:00.654 --> 12:02.324
Is it? Is-is...?
It's gonna be a blast.

12:02.322 --> 12:03.822
Yes, it's gonna be
a blast. Manny out.

12:03.824 --> 12:05.524
Kevin, here... here's the...
Manny out.

12:05.525 --> 12:06.925
Or maybe Manny <i> out!</i>

12:06.927 --> 12:08.657
Whatever... whatever works.

12:19.339 --> 12:22.339
But water, scarce though it is,
has also, like the wind,

12:22.342 --> 12:23.742
shaped the land itself.

12:23.744 --> 12:25.684
Nothing can live...

12:25.679 --> 12:28.679
All right, little mamas,
five-minute warning

12:28.682 --> 12:30.082
till teeth brushing.
But...

12:30.083 --> 12:32.923
It's not open
for discussion.

12:32.919 --> 12:35.289
Rain, the source of all...

12:35.288 --> 12:37.018
Hey, William
William!

12:37.023 --> 12:38.563
Hi, everybody.

12:38.558 --> 12:40.058
You're home late.

12:40.060 --> 12:42.090
Everything okay?

12:42.095 --> 12:44.225
Yeah, yes. I'm fine.

12:44.231 --> 12:46.401
Just a long day.

12:46.399 --> 12:48.629
I think I may just go
lay myself down

12:48.635 --> 12:50.095
for the night.

12:50.103 --> 12:52.743
Well... night.

12:52.739 --> 12:53.969
Night.

12:55.776 --> 12:58.436
From the ashes rises
the Phoenix...

12:58.445 --> 13:00.745
Okay, monsters, these teeth
aren't gonna brush themselves.

13:02.315 --> 13:05.145
Oh, God. Hey, girl,
what you been eating?
Ice cream.

13:05.152 --> 13:07.552
You scream?
I'm gonna scream

13:07.554 --> 13:09.994
if I got to carry you
up these stairs.

13:11.458 --> 13:14.128
You're too heavy.

13:14.127 --> 13:16.587
<i> Guess the thing I really need</i>

13:16.596 --> 13:19.496
to say out loud
to everyone is, well...

13:19.499 --> 13:22.069
I'm down three pounds
in one week.

13:23.804 --> 13:27.144
Oh, guys, come on.
Stop. Stop. You don't...

13:27.140 --> 13:28.670
Well, okay, fine, keep going.

13:28.675 --> 13:32.435
I'm-I'm so happy.
I'm...

13:32.445 --> 13:35.345
Well, I had a crap day at work,
so I stopped at Wendy's.

13:35.348 --> 13:37.678
And I was about
to eat in the car,

13:37.684 --> 13:39.654
which is... all you know
is my thing.

13:39.653 --> 13:43.293
The second I left
the drive-through, I threw

13:43.290 --> 13:46.830
ten dollars' worth of Wendy's
out of my moving car,

13:46.827 --> 13:48.957
and I went home,
and I had a salad.

13:50.764 --> 13:53.804
I know I'm ridiculous.
I know

13:53.800 --> 13:55.830
I'm a joke to you guys.

13:55.836 --> 13:57.836
I know I have body

13:57.838 --> 14:00.438
distortion issues
or whatever it's called,

14:00.440 --> 14:02.270
but it's real.

14:02.275 --> 14:03.675
It's brutal.

14:03.677 --> 14:05.307
I wish I could
show you guys

14:05.312 --> 14:07.382
what I see when I look
in the mirror...

14:07.380 --> 14:09.050
Oh, for God's sake.

14:09.049 --> 14:12.179
Madison, you weigh 105 pounds.

14:12.185 --> 14:13.985
If you feel like a fat girl
when you look in the mirror,

14:13.987 --> 14:15.947
why don't you
step a damn scale?

14:15.956 --> 14:18.656
And when the scale reads
"one, zero, five,"

14:18.658 --> 14:19.958
you know that you're not fat.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.030
And Laurie,

14:21.027 --> 14:23.557
that Wendy's story, okay.

14:23.563 --> 14:25.033
I'm sorry, but
you're just a litterer.

14:25.031 --> 14:27.401
You're just a littering
damn litterer.

14:29.703 --> 14:32.073
Uh...

14:32.072 --> 14:34.812
Well, that feels like
a good place for a break.

14:43.884 --> 14:46.924
You hulked out
on a bunch of fatties.

14:46.920 --> 14:49.820
You're not going to
make me laugh, Toby.

14:49.823 --> 14:52.463
What's up, kid?

14:54.995 --> 14:58.925
My brother is making me go to
this nightmare Hollywood party

14:58.932 --> 15:01.502
at his agent's house tonight.
Yeah, I went to buy a dress,

15:01.501 --> 15:03.571
and nothing fit,
literally nothing.

15:03.570 --> 15:05.370
Everything looks terrible.

15:05.372 --> 15:06.602
I'm not losing weight.

15:06.606 --> 15:08.366
I'm starving.

15:08.375 --> 15:10.235
I don't know.

15:10.243 --> 15:13.613
That's what's up, I guess.

15:13.613 --> 15:15.583
Okay.

15:15.582 --> 15:18.882
Hey, your brother's agent is
lanie Shultz, right?

15:18.885 --> 15:20.515
Yeah.

15:20.520 --> 15:23.290
Kate, lanie Shultz

15:23.290 --> 15:25.560
is one of the most
powerful agents

15:25.558 --> 15:28.388
in what I like to call...
Show business.

15:28.395 --> 15:29.925
I heard

15:29.930 --> 15:32.430
that <i> deadpool</i> was her idea.

15:32.432 --> 15:33.902
Or maybe it was <i> Hamilton.</i>

15:33.900 --> 15:35.600
I get those two confused.
Anyway,

15:35.602 --> 15:39.802
Kate, you are so taking me
to that party.

15:39.806 --> 15:41.236
Uh-uh.
Mm-hmm.

15:41.241 --> 15:43.041
No. I don't want you
to see me there.

15:43.043 --> 15:44.913
Like, I am at my worst
at those things.

15:44.911 --> 15:47.611
Kate, you are
at your worst

15:47.614 --> 15:50.384
when you are eviscerating
the anorexic lady,

15:50.383 --> 15:52.823
and I am still
standing here.

15:52.819 --> 15:54.619
Look,

15:54.621 --> 15:58.061
we have had three lunches
and four dinner dates.

15:58.058 --> 16:01.928
We have made out seven times
and heavy-petted twice.

16:01.928 --> 16:04.298
Our plane is rapidly approaching

16:04.297 --> 16:05.827
the boyfriend-girlfriend zone,

16:05.832 --> 16:08.272
and, I, for one,
am preparing myself for landing.

16:08.268 --> 16:09.768
But I need to know
that everything

16:09.769 --> 16:11.839
isn't gonna always be
about our weight.

16:11.838 --> 16:14.138
All right? We need to be
able to cut loose at parties.

16:14.140 --> 16:16.740
We need to get really dressed
up, we need to have sex.

16:16.743 --> 16:18.743
I just slipped that in there
very casually

16:18.745 --> 16:20.135
because I think that's something

16:20.146 --> 16:21.776
that we should start doing
very soon.

16:21.781 --> 16:25.251
So, Kate, I am asking you,
please, for the love of God,

16:25.251 --> 16:27.921
can we spend one fat-free night

16:27.921 --> 16:30.291
at the house of the lady
who came up with the idea

16:30.290 --> 16:31.990
for <i> deadpool</i> and/or <i> Hamilton?</i>

16:33.126 --> 16:35.926
Is that a...
Is that a smile?

16:35.929 --> 16:38.699
Is that...?
Yes, that's a yes and a smile.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.868
All right, hey, guys,
Bruce banner's back.

16:41.868 --> 16:43.938
Everything's fine.
The hulk is gone.

16:43.937 --> 16:46.397
Let the healing continue.
Sorry about that.

16:52.345 --> 16:54.345
Are you comfy?

16:54.347 --> 16:56.177
Okay, sweetness.

16:56.182 --> 16:57.782
Good night.
I love you so much.

16:57.784 --> 17:00.354
I love you, too.

17:00.353 --> 17:01.853
Mom?

17:01.855 --> 17:04.315
Yeah, babe?

17:04.324 --> 17:06.964
I only ate fruit today.

17:12.965 --> 17:15.896
You know I just want you
to be healthy, right?

17:15.902 --> 17:18.372
And I want you to be happy.

17:18.371 --> 17:20.741
Are you happy?

17:20.740 --> 17:22.569
For the most part.

17:24.144 --> 17:26.614
Well, then, I'm happy, too.

17:28.248 --> 17:29.678
Tell you what. How about

17:29.682 --> 17:31.752
you and I find a healthy balance
together?

17:31.751 --> 17:33.521
How does that sound?

17:33.520 --> 17:35.320
All right.
- Shut up!

17:35.321 --> 17:36.851
- You shut up, Webster.
- Stop calling me names!

17:36.856 --> 17:39.316
Goodnight.
Boys?

17:39.325 --> 17:41.155
Uh-uh.
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey!

17:41.161 --> 17:42.391
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

17:42.395 --> 17:44.525
No, stop.
To your beds right now.

17:44.531 --> 17:46.931
Now.

17:46.933 --> 17:48.733
Okay, who am I yelling at first?

17:53.106 --> 17:54.506
Kev, bud, what is the deal?

17:54.507 --> 17:56.237
Why are you always
so hard on him?

17:56.242 --> 17:59.142
Everybody thinks it's
weird that we're brothers.

18:00.847 --> 18:03.847
You know it doesn't matter
what people think.

18:03.850 --> 18:05.280
He is your little brother,
Kevin.

18:05.285 --> 18:06.915
You have to be there
for one another.

18:06.920 --> 18:08.190
Do you hear me?

18:09.923 --> 18:11.423
Yes.

18:13.760 --> 18:15.090
I love you.

18:23.203 --> 18:25.943
Can you force him be nice?

18:25.939 --> 18:28.739
I'll see what I can do.

18:28.741 --> 18:30.611
Hey.

18:30.610 --> 18:32.940
Promise me you'll
always be good.

18:34.481 --> 18:36.311
I'll see what I can do.

18:39.085 --> 18:41.615
I love you.

18:41.621 --> 18:43.421
Now get some sleep, please.

18:43.423 --> 18:44.923
No more fighting.

18:44.924 --> 18:47.464
Don't make me come back in here.

18:47.460 --> 18:49.260
Good night, I love you.

19:05.678 --> 19:07.308
Hi, baby.

19:07.313 --> 19:09.883
Hi, baby.

19:11.951 --> 19:13.481
Did I miss putting them down?

19:13.486 --> 19:15.886
Just by an hour.

19:18.124 --> 19:20.534
Well, I was...

19:20.527 --> 19:22.857
I was-- oh, shopping.

19:22.862 --> 19:24.532
I was shopping.

19:27.167 --> 19:30.127
I know...

19:31.804 --> 19:35.944
I know we haven't been
on the same page lately.

19:35.942 --> 19:39.612
That we just got to
get back on track, baby.

19:39.612 --> 19:42.112
So...

19:42.115 --> 19:45.675
Consider this a...
Way-too-expensive

19:45.685 --> 19:47.185
peace offering.

19:47.187 --> 19:49.887
I think we've been
more than off track.

19:55.628 --> 19:59.298
Hey, how do you think
we're doing so far?

19:59.299 --> 20:00.999
At parenting?

20:01.000 --> 20:04.170
I...
'Cause I think we're at a six.

20:04.170 --> 20:07.070
On a sliding scale,
one through ten,

20:07.073 --> 20:10.643
I think we're at a six
and I think I'm being generous.

20:10.643 --> 20:13.513
Bec...
Seven, fine,

20:13.513 --> 20:15.913
but only because
there are three of them.

20:15.915 --> 20:17.715
Baby, I...
And the thing is,

20:17.717 --> 20:21.247
I'm trying really hard
to get us to a nine.

20:21.254 --> 20:24.194
Because they are cute kids,
and they deserve nine-parents.

20:24.190 --> 20:29.090
And, the thing is,
i feel like I'm there, Jack.

20:30.563 --> 20:34.333
I feel like
I'm operating at a nine.

20:34.334 --> 20:38.704
Because I do
individualized lunches

20:38.705 --> 20:41.035
and I do individualized tuck-ins
for each kid

20:41.040 --> 20:42.770
so nobody feels gypped.

20:42.775 --> 20:44.335
And...

20:48.548 --> 20:53.018
When you're home,
and you're you,

20:53.019 --> 20:56.049
you're way better than I am.

20:56.055 --> 21:00.555
You're a ten when
you're you, Jack.

21:00.560 --> 21:03.590
But you're getting home
later and later

21:03.596 --> 21:05.426
and when you do come home,
you're...
Bec, what are you saying?

21:05.431 --> 21:07.331
The drinking has to stop.

21:10.603 --> 21:12.043
You have to reign it in, baby,

21:12.038 --> 21:15.308
because I won't have it
in my house.

21:15.308 --> 21:19.078
You won't have it
in your house.
I won't.

21:19.078 --> 21:21.308
So if it's a problem, fix it.

21:21.314 --> 21:24.284
Be a man, and fix it.

21:24.284 --> 21:27.824
Because I'm done letting you
lower our score.

21:41.968 --> 21:43.228
Damn.

21:43.236 --> 21:45.236
Yeah?
- Yeah.

21:45.238 --> 21:46.738
Hell to the yeah.

21:46.739 --> 21:48.509
Thanks.

21:48.508 --> 21:49.768
You look dapper.

21:49.776 --> 21:51.336
Ah, show business.

21:51.344 --> 21:52.914
Oh, great, you're, uh--

21:52.912 --> 21:54.312
we got to go, you know?

21:54.314 --> 21:56.084
'Cause we're gonna be late.
Okay.

21:56.082 --> 21:57.282
You're wearing that?

21:57.283 --> 21:58.323
Yeah.

21:58.318 --> 22:00.448
That's great.

22:00.453 --> 22:02.523
You look awesome.
Oh, is the hat too much?

22:02.522 --> 22:04.122
The hat is everything.

22:04.123 --> 22:06.363
Yeah, that's a real
peacock feather.

22:06.359 --> 22:08.759
Come on, show business!

22:14.100 --> 22:15.770
* Stuck to the wall *

22:15.768 --> 22:18.268
* you think you really know
where we wanna go *

22:18.271 --> 22:20.771
hey, go, okay? And I'm
right here if you need me.

22:20.773 --> 22:22.843
Okay?

22:22.842 --> 22:25.412
Manny out.
- Go get 'em.

22:27.447 --> 22:30.607
You and I are crushing
that dance floor.

22:30.616 --> 22:32.476
Let's go.
Come on, let's go.

22:32.485 --> 22:34.015
* Groovin' *

22:34.020 --> 22:36.550
* my record's spinning
with the dj *

22:36.556 --> 22:38.516
* he lets my song play *

22:38.524 --> 22:40.964
* from night until day *

22:43.663 --> 22:45.403
Oh, no!

22:45.398 --> 22:47.698
Come on!
Come on.

23:06.085 --> 23:08.685
<i> Kate.</i>

23:08.688 --> 23:09.988
Kate.

23:09.989 --> 23:11.219
Kate.

23:13.326 --> 23:15.486
All right, come on, come on,
we're getting you drunk.

23:15.495 --> 23:17.925
Come on, yup.
Time to get drunk.
Let's just go.

23:17.930 --> 23:20.360
Jack,

23:20.366 --> 23:22.196
it's Miguel.

23:22.201 --> 23:23.901
It's late, so I'm leaving you
a message at the office

23:23.903 --> 23:25.743
in case I miss you
in the morning.

23:25.738 --> 23:30.238
Feel like I overstepped before.

23:30.243 --> 23:31.783
Um, you know I love you,

23:31.778 --> 23:33.108
you know I love you guys.

23:33.112 --> 23:34.912
Hell...

23:34.914 --> 23:37.554
<i> I'm jealous of your</i>
<i> relationship, if anything.</i>

23:37.550 --> 23:40.280
Uh, I shouldn't have
said anything at the bar.

23:40.286 --> 23:41.616
Now I'm just overdoing it.

23:41.621 --> 23:43.221
Uh...

23:43.222 --> 23:45.662
Okay. Bye.

23:51.297 --> 23:52.957
Hey.

23:52.965 --> 23:54.925
You need to get
some sleep, it's late.

23:54.934 --> 23:56.534
You've been up since,
like, 4:00 this morning.

23:56.536 --> 23:57.766
No, I know.

23:57.770 --> 24:00.370
Just five more minutes.

24:03.042 --> 24:05.642
Hey.

24:05.645 --> 24:06.905
Shower.

24:06.913 --> 24:08.253
Sleep.

24:08.247 --> 24:10.577
Now.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.983
You shower quick, you can work
off that last five minutes

24:12.985 --> 24:14.485
a different way.

24:21.461 --> 24:24.561
I am so happy that
we could all get together.

24:24.564 --> 24:26.664
You know, work through, and...

24:26.666 --> 24:28.596
And...
Kevin just feels awful...

24:28.601 --> 24:32.071
I'm so sorry, this is whole
thing, lanie, is ridiculous.

24:32.071 --> 24:34.571
I mean...

24:34.574 --> 24:37.144
Mr. Manning.

24:37.143 --> 24:38.783
I'm truly grateful
for everything

24:38.778 --> 24:41.348
that your network
has done for me, I am.

24:41.347 --> 24:44.147
But please let me
go with God, sir.

24:44.150 --> 24:46.420
The way I handled myself,

24:46.419 --> 24:48.849
I mean, that was wrong, I'll be
the first one to admit that.

24:48.855 --> 24:51.815
That-that was wrong.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.664
But can't we all, at this point,
just, sort of, you know...

24:55.661 --> 24:57.931
Sort of move on, right?

25:00.199 --> 25:02.629
You're a good kid, Kevin.

25:02.635 --> 25:03.965
I appreciate your honesty.

25:03.970 --> 25:05.200
Thank you.

25:05.204 --> 25:07.714
The show, it's a
solid performer,

25:07.707 --> 25:10.307
but it's not the
biggest thing on my network.

25:10.309 --> 25:12.309
Without lanie telling me,

25:12.311 --> 25:15.311
would I have known you
from one of these waiters

25:15.314 --> 25:18.024
passing around
the chicken skewers?

25:18.017 --> 25:20.847
Probably not.
Really?

25:20.853 --> 25:22.953
I really don't care what
happens behind the scenes

25:22.955 --> 25:25.985
on my third-rated sitcom.

25:25.992 --> 25:27.732
You know what I do care about?

25:27.727 --> 25:29.327
Mm-mm.

25:29.328 --> 25:30.788
St. maarten, Kevin.

25:30.796 --> 25:34.196
I'm building a home
in St. maarten

25:34.200 --> 25:37.200
and in two years
I'm going to retire,

25:37.203 --> 25:40.473
and my favorite wife and i
are going to move there.

25:40.473 --> 25:42.713
Until then,

25:42.708 --> 25:45.478
I plan on just drifting
through these two years

25:45.478 --> 25:49.548
as painlessly and drama-free
as possible.

25:49.549 --> 25:51.849
Like I'm on morphine, Kevin,

25:51.851 --> 25:55.891
that's how I'll be drifting
through those years.

25:58.991 --> 26:01.491
Okay.

26:01.494 --> 26:05.264
That's... great, you know?

26:05.264 --> 26:06.764
Go with God.

26:09.835 --> 26:13.235
You know, the thing is--
excuse me darling.

26:13.239 --> 26:17.269
Recasting the lead
on a hit sitcom,

26:17.276 --> 26:21.546
isn't exactly drifting on
morphine, now is it, Kevin?

26:21.547 --> 26:24.347
So unfortunately, my boy,

26:24.350 --> 26:27.380
you're not gonna be
leaving the show.

26:27.386 --> 26:32.356
If you do, I'll be forced to
Nagasaki your life and career.

26:32.358 --> 26:36.558
Hey, have you ever heard of
the actor, uh, Taylor Jennings?

26:36.562 --> 26:38.032
I'm not familiar with the name.

26:38.030 --> 26:39.600
I Nagasaki'd him.

26:41.434 --> 26:44.034
So take the money, kid.

26:44.036 --> 26:47.266
Ride out the next
couple years, all right?

26:47.273 --> 26:49.473
Otherwise, I'll make you
a bigger laughingstock

26:49.475 --> 26:51.475
than you already are.

26:53.212 --> 26:56.312
Deal?

26:56.315 --> 26:59.215
I'm sorry, I'm j--
I'm gonna go, uh...

26:59.218 --> 27:00.448
My sister's here,

27:00.453 --> 27:01.793
I'm gonna go check on her.

27:04.991 --> 27:08.391
It's his twin sister.

27:08.394 --> 27:09.994
Big girl.

27:09.996 --> 27:11.656
* Yeah, we're all about
a good time *

27:11.664 --> 27:12.964
* yeah, we're all about
a good life *

27:15.635 --> 27:18.265
You love drunk Kate.
I love drunk Kate.

27:18.270 --> 27:19.800
Wait, what?

27:19.805 --> 27:21.065
Woo!
Hey.

27:21.073 --> 27:22.313
Hey!

27:22.308 --> 27:24.338
How'd it go?
I'm wasted.

27:24.343 --> 27:25.683
Not good.

27:25.678 --> 27:27.408
Good?
Oh, my God, that's great.

27:27.413 --> 27:29.113
No, no, no, no,<i> not</i> good.

27:29.115 --> 27:30.575
It did not-- I don't know
what I'm gonna do.

27:30.583 --> 27:32.583
Uh-oh!

27:32.585 --> 27:34.445
Gone fishing.
You caught a whopper!

27:34.453 --> 27:37.023
Uh-oh.

27:37.023 --> 27:39.263
Come reel me in,
got to reel me in.

27:39.258 --> 27:41.658
It's my first time fishing.

27:41.661 --> 27:43.961
Won't be his last.
Well...

27:43.963 --> 27:46.163
* Yeah, we're all about
a good time *

27:46.165 --> 27:47.995
* yeah, we're all about
a good life. *
kev!

27:52.371 --> 27:56.671
Which little monster's
standing at my door?

27:56.676 --> 28:00.376
It's okay, I'm way too old
to be scared of monsters.

28:04.483 --> 28:07.383
I think it's time
you and I had a talk.

28:40.186 --> 28:42.316
I can't wait until the next day
of school starts.

28:42.321 --> 28:44.591
Hey, everyone, it's Webster!

28:50.496 --> 28:51.726
Kev,

28:51.731 --> 28:53.031
come on, Kevin,
ditch Webster.

28:53.032 --> 28:54.502
Let's go.

28:54.500 --> 28:57.100
Come on.

29:07.513 --> 29:08.753
Hey.

29:08.748 --> 29:10.078
Hey.

29:10.082 --> 29:11.852
Hey, uh... is it too late
out there?

29:11.851 --> 29:13.281
I know you're usually up late,
right?

29:13.285 --> 29:15.445
No, I was just, uh...

29:15.454 --> 29:17.094
Catching up on some paperwork.

29:17.089 --> 29:18.759
Sweet, uh...

29:18.758 --> 29:20.588
Hey, listen, i-i know
I've owed you a phone call

29:20.593 --> 29:22.193
since everything went down,

29:22.194 --> 29:23.694
it's been crazy out here,
just... you know.

29:23.696 --> 29:25.096
No, it's all good.

29:25.097 --> 29:27.057
Kate's kept me up to speed.

29:27.066 --> 29:29.126
Good.

29:34.874 --> 29:37.374
They said they're not gonna
let me out of the show, man.

29:37.376 --> 29:39.206
And I...

29:39.211 --> 29:41.211
I don't know what I'm gonna do,
like...

29:41.213 --> 29:43.783
They locked me in
for two more years, maybe more.

29:43.783 --> 29:45.723
Damn.

29:45.718 --> 29:47.118
Well, what are you gonna do?

29:47.119 --> 29:49.649
I was kind of hoping
you'd tell me.

29:49.655 --> 29:53.155
Oh, because you care
what I think?

29:53.159 --> 29:55.959
Because I care
what everyone thinks, man.

29:55.961 --> 29:57.561
You know that.

29:59.665 --> 30:03.725
I was not a very good
brother to you, was I?

30:03.736 --> 30:05.136
No, you weren't.

30:06.939 --> 30:09.009
But you've still got time.

30:09.008 --> 30:11.308
Hey!

30:11.310 --> 30:13.140
Yeah, uh...

30:13.145 --> 30:15.345
Anyway, look, it's getting
late, man, I, you know...

30:15.347 --> 30:16.607
I probably should go.

30:16.615 --> 30:18.245
It's, uh...

30:18.250 --> 30:19.850
Kate's here, it's Randall.

30:19.852 --> 30:21.952
Oh, hey, Randall!
Hey.

30:21.954 --> 30:24.454
Anyway, yeah,
i-i should probably, uh...

30:24.456 --> 30:26.086
I got to go back inside
and sell my soul to the network,

30:26.091 --> 30:27.321
like the whore that I am.

30:27.326 --> 30:28.686
Hey, kev.

30:32.164 --> 30:33.504
Deep breath, okay?

30:36.435 --> 30:38.835
Come on, man.
First came...

30:40.339 --> 30:41.609
Me.

30:41.607 --> 30:43.107
And dad said...

30:43.108 --> 30:44.578
"Gee."

30:47.880 --> 30:49.280
And then came...
Me!

30:49.281 --> 30:50.511
And mom said...

30:50.516 --> 30:52.146
"Whee!"
And then came...

30:52.151 --> 30:53.481
Me.
And they said...

30:53.485 --> 30:54.515
"That's three."

30:54.520 --> 30:57.120
Big three!
- Big three!

30:57.122 --> 30:59.392
Yeah.

31:05.464 --> 31:07.164
You good?

31:07.166 --> 31:09.666
Uh... yeah.

31:09.668 --> 31:12.738
Yeah, I'm good, I'm good.

31:12.738 --> 31:15.038
Kevin?
Yeah?

31:15.040 --> 31:18.340
Mom and dad didn't raise
no whores.

31:18.344 --> 31:21.554
Except briefly,
during Kate's eyeliner phase.

31:23.749 --> 31:26.449
Yeah.

31:29.088 --> 31:31.858
Night, little brother.

31:31.857 --> 31:34.557
Night, big brother.

31:43.002 --> 31:44.902
Hon?

31:44.904 --> 31:46.344
There you go.
Thank you.

31:46.338 --> 31:48.168
Mm-hmm.

31:48.173 --> 31:51.713
Can I cut to the chase?

31:51.710 --> 31:53.210
It's your meeting.

31:56.949 --> 32:00.779
Eight years ago, I was, um,
pregnant for the first time.

32:00.786 --> 32:04.416
And Randall was vying
for partner at his firm.

32:04.423 --> 32:07.523
We'd just bought this house
on faith,

32:07.526 --> 32:09.956
even though it needed
a lot of work,

32:09.962 --> 32:14.062
even though we couldn't
afford it whatsoever.

32:14.066 --> 32:16.226
Then Randall made partner.

32:16.235 --> 32:18.695
He did all the work
on the house himself,

32:18.704 --> 32:20.604
so we didn't have
to spend a penny.

32:20.606 --> 32:23.036
And he made sure
i didn't lift a finger

32:23.042 --> 32:24.782
during my pregnancy.

32:24.777 --> 32:26.037
He's a good man.

32:26.045 --> 32:28.245
No, he's not good.

32:28.247 --> 32:30.907
He's perfect.

32:30.916 --> 32:33.546
Problem is, he stopped sleeping.

32:33.552 --> 32:36.892
And then one morning,
i was in the bathroom,

32:36.889 --> 32:40.259
and he called out to me.

32:40.259 --> 32:41.959
And he was confused, you know?

32:43.896 --> 32:45.726
He was confused because he...

32:46.732 --> 32:48.802
Couldn't see anything.

32:50.736 --> 32:55.636
My husband--
my Mountain of a man--

32:55.641 --> 33:00.641
could literally no longer
see things through his eyes.

33:00.646 --> 33:03.106
It was as if 28 years
of being that perfect

33:03.115 --> 33:05.475
had all caught up to him
that morning.

33:06.452 --> 33:09.822
And he, um...

33:09.822 --> 33:12.792
He pulled himself out of it.

33:12.791 --> 33:16.331
He self-corrected,

33:16.328 --> 33:18.398
'cause that's what my man does.

33:21.133 --> 33:25.943
Randall is not free of vice,
William.

33:25.938 --> 33:29.138
His vice is his goodness.

33:29.141 --> 33:31.641
It's his compulsive drive

33:31.643 --> 33:34.643
to be perfect.

33:34.646 --> 33:38.716
It's why I love him...

33:38.717 --> 33:43.117
But it's also why I have to
protect him sometimes, you know?

33:43.122 --> 33:46.792
So now, I'm gonna have to
ask you a couple questions,

33:46.792 --> 33:51.962
questions he would probably be
too polite to ask himself.

33:52.965 --> 33:55.325
Ask away.

33:55.334 --> 33:57.974
The money you borrow.

33:57.970 --> 34:00.640
You use it for the bus?

34:00.639 --> 34:02.569
Yes.

34:02.574 --> 34:05.484
Where do you go?

34:05.477 --> 34:09.007
You're gone all day, every day.

34:09.014 --> 34:13.024
My place in Philadelphia,
it's a long ride.

34:13.018 --> 34:14.888
Why?

34:14.887 --> 34:16.487
Are you using drugs?

34:16.487 --> 34:18.388
Are you getting drugs?
Mm-mm. No.

34:19.358 --> 34:21.088
Are you really sick?

34:22.061 --> 34:24.591
Yes, I am.

34:26.398 --> 34:30.098
Beth, I said it before,
and I really meant it:

34:30.101 --> 34:32.042
If I'm overstaying my welcome,

34:32.036 --> 34:33.637
I wish you would just say it.

34:34.606 --> 34:37.866
William, you are overstaying...

34:37.876 --> 34:39.606
Beth.

34:39.610 --> 34:41.241
What are you doing?

34:41.246 --> 34:43.206
Somebody has to ask
the questions here, baby...

34:43.215 --> 34:45.275
It's a cat.

34:46.685 --> 34:48.945
I have a cat.

34:48.954 --> 34:52.123
It's all I really have.

34:52.123 --> 34:54.864
His name's Clooney.

34:54.860 --> 34:59.230
One of those ironic names,
'cause he's a pretty ugly cat.

34:59.231 --> 35:01.801
I go back and forth to feed him.

35:01.800 --> 35:04.400
Three hours on the bus each day.

35:04.403 --> 35:07.143
Why wouldn't you just
tell us you had a cat?

35:07.139 --> 35:08.439
Nah.

35:08.440 --> 35:09.970
The little one has asthma

35:09.975 --> 35:11.405
and I knew if
i brought up the cat,

35:11.410 --> 35:12.540
you'd tell me to bring it,

35:12.544 --> 35:13.914
that would cause problems.

35:13.912 --> 35:15.612
And I don't want
to cause any problems,

35:15.614 --> 35:17.154
'cause if I cause problems,
I'd have to leave.

35:17.149 --> 35:18.419
And...

35:18.417 --> 35:21.217
And I don't want to leave.

35:21.220 --> 35:24.750
Six months ago, some doctor
told me I had three to live.

35:24.756 --> 35:27.916
But for some reason,
i don't feel so bad lately.

35:27.926 --> 35:30.426
Maybe to do with this house.

35:30.429 --> 35:33.059
I don't know.

35:33.065 --> 35:34.495
Truth is, I'd never thought

35:34.500 --> 35:36.100
I'd have anything
to care about again

35:36.101 --> 35:38.371
besides an ugly cat, so...

35:43.108 --> 35:45.438
Well, now I feel like a bitch.

35:47.980 --> 35:49.080
It's not funny.

35:49.081 --> 35:50.251
It's not.

35:50.249 --> 35:51.979
It's not funny.

35:58.090 --> 36:02.290
I'm about two hours away
from throwing up violently.

36:02.294 --> 36:03.694
Mm.

36:03.695 --> 36:05.495
Are you gonna hold my hair
for me, Toby?

36:05.497 --> 36:07.627
No. I-I'm still gonna be
at this party,

36:07.633 --> 36:09.273
trying to bang
a gilmore girl.

36:11.036 --> 36:13.036
Well, go for both.

36:13.038 --> 36:15.438
Gil-more the gil-merrier.

36:21.113 --> 36:25.453
It's always gonna be
about the weight for me, Toby.

36:28.053 --> 36:30.523
It's been my story ever since
i was a little girl.

36:33.292 --> 36:35.662
And every moment that
I'm not thinking about it,

36:35.661 --> 36:37.561
I'm thinking about it.

36:37.563 --> 36:39.333
Like...

36:39.331 --> 36:41.201
Will this chair hold me?

36:41.200 --> 36:44.170
Will this dress fit me?

36:44.169 --> 36:47.339
And if I ever get pregnant,
would...

36:47.339 --> 36:49.609
Will anyone ever notice?

36:54.546 --> 36:57.076
It's just at the core of
who I am, it's just deep inside,

36:57.082 --> 36:59.922
and eight Tequila shots can only
mask that for a couple hours.

36:59.918 --> 37:01.818
So...
I know.

37:04.389 --> 37:05.659
And it was ten Tequila shots,

37:05.657 --> 37:09.387
but I... I get it.
I know.

37:11.763 --> 37:13.403
And just for the record,

37:13.398 --> 37:18.438
um, this dress is fitting you
in all the right places.

37:19.438 --> 37:21.868
This old thing?
Uh-huh.

37:21.873 --> 37:23.113
I mean, i-i just threw it on.

37:23.108 --> 37:24.408
Oh, you just threw it on?
Mm-hmm.

37:24.409 --> 37:25.679
I didn't even
think about it.

37:31.917 --> 37:33.317
There he is.

37:35.887 --> 37:37.887
I told 'em to go
screw themselves.

37:37.889 --> 37:40.259
And what'd they say?

37:41.226 --> 37:43.586
A lot of mean, scary things.

37:48.233 --> 37:50.973
I'm gonna do theater.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.669
You know?

37:53.605 --> 37:56.005
I'm moving
to New York.

38:00.379 --> 38:02.809
Show business.

38:12.591 --> 38:15.131
What are you doing out here?

38:18.263 --> 38:21.203
I don't like sleeping
far away from you.

38:23.935 --> 38:25.735
No more drinking.

38:25.737 --> 38:26.967
You can't just stop...

38:26.972 --> 38:28.242
I can.

38:28.240 --> 38:30.310
For you, I can.

38:31.677 --> 38:33.407
I will.

38:37.849 --> 38:39.579
You know, when I was
a little boy,

38:39.584 --> 38:43.354
I didn't know what I wanted
to be when I grew up.

38:47.292 --> 38:51.162
Adults always ask
little kids that.

38:53.365 --> 38:55.125
You know?

38:55.133 --> 38:57.703
I never had a good answer.

38:57.703 --> 39:00.543
Not until... not until I was 28.

39:02.007 --> 39:04.167
Till the day that I met you.

39:06.144 --> 39:10.354
That's when I knew exactly what
i wanted to be when I grew up:

39:12.317 --> 39:14.777
I wanted to be the man
that made you happy.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.857
You make me happy.

39:20.859 --> 39:22.789
Not always.

39:22.794 --> 39:25.634
Not lately.

39:29.534 --> 39:34.244
From here on out, I'm gonna be
an 11 for you, baby.

39:36.208 --> 39:38.678
No...

39:38.677 --> 39:41.337
Screw that.

39:41.346 --> 39:45.846
I'm gonna be a 12 for you,
from here out.

39:45.851 --> 39:49.191
I'll be an 11
for the kids,

39:49.187 --> 39:50.717
but you get a 12.

39:56.595 --> 39:58.625
Do you forgive me?

40:00.599 --> 40:04.299
You slept outside our bedroom
door like a labrador.

40:06.571 --> 40:08.771
Of course I forgive you.

40:15.080 --> 40:16.910
Can I still give you my gift?

40:17.883 --> 40:19.953
If you insist.

40:29.728 --> 40:31.958
* Come down off your throne *

40:31.963 --> 40:33.603
do you like it?

40:33.598 --> 40:35.368
* And leave your body alone *

40:35.367 --> 40:37.027
I got a moon because of...
Our song.

40:37.035 --> 40:38.595
Yeah.

40:38.603 --> 40:41.043
* Somebody must change *

40:41.039 --> 40:42.739
I'm never gonna take it off.

40:42.741 --> 40:48.141
* You are reason
I've been waiting so long *

40:48.146 --> 40:50.046
* somebody holds the key *

40:50.048 --> 40:51.978
do you like it?

40:51.983 --> 40:53.953
Does it look good?

40:53.952 --> 40:55.752
* But I'm near the end *
it's beautiful.

40:55.754 --> 40:57.124
Thank you.

40:57.122 --> 41:00.822
* I just ain't got the time *

41:00.826 --> 41:01.956
mm.

41:01.960 --> 41:05.260
* And I'm wasted *

41:05.263 --> 41:07.163
* and I can't find my way home *
how much time we have
till the kids get up?

41:07.165 --> 41:09.665
I don't care about the kids.

41:12.404 --> 41:15.414
Pile drive!

41:19.644 --> 41:24.514
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh *

41:24.516 --> 41:26.646
* ooh ooh ooh *

41:26.651 --> 41:30.521
* ooh ooh-ooh ooh *

41:30.522 --> 41:34.022
* come down on your own *

41:34.025 --> 41:37.485
* and leave your body alone *

41:37.496 --> 41:40.626
* somebody must change *

41:40.632 --> 41:43.102
Daddy, stop! Daddy, stop!

41:43.101 --> 41:46.141
If you want to sleep in,
you have to pay the tickle tax!

41:46.137 --> 41:47.637
Tickle tax.

41:49.140 --> 41:50.810
Oh. All right, come on, honey.

41:50.809 --> 41:51.809
It's time to take care of...

41:51.810 --> 41:52.880
Here you go.

41:52.878 --> 41:55.448
* But I'm near the end *

41:55.447 --> 41:56.607
Good.

41:56.615 --> 41:58.545
Big breath.

41:58.550 --> 42:00.280
Good.

42:00.285 --> 42:02.115
You expecting somebody?

42:02.120 --> 42:04.690
* And I'm wasted *
no.

42:04.689 --> 42:07.159
* And I can't find my way home *

42:07.158 --> 42:09.258
Grandma and grandpa are here!

42:10.228 --> 42:12.528
I'll be in my room.

42:17.235 --> 42:22.665
* Ooh ooh ooh ooh *

42:22.674 --> 42:25.144
* but I can't find my way home *
hey, mom.

42:25.143 --> 42:26.743
Hey, Miguel.

42:26.745 --> 42:28.335
* But I can't find
my way home. *

42:28.346 --> 42:30.076
hey.

42:31.483 --> 42:32.953
and Toyota.
