♪ Men. ♪

00:04.852 --> 00:09.022
No... No, Charlie.

00:09.023 --> 00:10.457
It's mine.

00:10.458 --> 00:12.025
What?

00:12.026 --> 00:13.627
Give it back.

00:13.628 --> 00:14.962
Ow!

00:14.963 --> 00:17.998
Mom! Charlie hit me!

00:17.999 --> 00:20.767
Oh, okay.

00:20.768 --> 00:22.903
Consuela, Charlie hit me.

00:22.904 --> 00:25.005
Ow!

00:25.006 --> 00:28.041
Mom, Consuela hit me.

00:28.042 --> 00:31.244
God. Here we go again.

00:31.245 --> 00:34.781
I'll run away,
then you'll be sorry.

00:34.782 --> 00:37.751
Ow! Mom, Charlie's making me
hit myself.

00:40.722 --> 00:42.556
Hey. What are
you doing up?

00:42.557 --> 00:44.891
Your brother's talking
in his sleep again.

00:44.892 --> 00:46.360
No kidding.
what about?

00:46.361 --> 00:49.062
Some childhood dream about
you making him hit himself.

00:49.063 --> 00:51.999
What childhood?
That was last week.

00:53.134 --> 00:54.634
<i>Sports Center?</i>

00:54.635 --> 00:57.537
Yeah. I'm making my picks
for tomorrow's games.

00:57.538 --> 00:59.106
Really, Charlie?

00:59.107 --> 01:00.807
Taking the points
against Georgetown?

01:00.808 --> 01:02.142
No.

01:02.143 --> 01:03.877
If you want to throw
your money away,

01:03.878 --> 01:06.179
why don't you just get married
without a prenup.

01:07.215 --> 01:09.416
You know something I don't?

01:09.417 --> 01:11.852
So far this year, Georgetown's
covered the spread

01:11.853 --> 01:13.086
eight times out of ten.

01:13.087 --> 01:15.822
Wow, you bet
college basketball?

01:15.823 --> 01:17.791
Only idiots bet
college basketball.

01:19.093 --> 01:20.060
No offense.

01:20.061 --> 01:22.029
Then how do you know
all this stuff?

01:22.030 --> 01:23.597
I worked for a
sports book in Vegas.

01:23.598 --> 01:25.065
Then I opened my own
little business

01:25.066 --> 01:27.134
in the back of a candle shop
in Sherman Oaks.

01:27.135 --> 01:30.237
I always wondered how those
places stayed in business.

01:30.238 --> 01:33.306
Yeah, so did the IRS.

01:33.307 --> 01:35.776
So they nailed you
for running a book?

01:35.777 --> 01:37.811
No. They nailed me
for running a candle store

01:37.812 --> 01:39.946
that made a quarter of a million
dollars a year

01:39.947 --> 01:41.882
without selling
one freakin' candle.

01:43.518 --> 01:45.919
Okay, so no on Georgetown.

01:45.920 --> 01:48.555
Does Alan know
about this?

01:48.556 --> 01:49.956
He knows about the candle store.

01:49.957 --> 01:51.691
Let's just keep
the other part between us.

01:51.692 --> 01:55.562
Yeah, he's kind of prissy
about moral stuff like gambling.

01:55.563 --> 01:56.563
Yeah, he is.

01:56.564 --> 01:57.731
And drinking.

01:57.732 --> 01:59.466
Well, that's only because
when he drinks,

01:59.467 --> 02:01.701
he gets all weepy
and then he pukes.

02:01.702 --> 02:02.936
And whoring.

02:02.937 --> 02:05.138
No, he doesn't have
a moral problem with that.

02:05.139 --> 02:07.541
He's just cheap
and he likes to cuddle.

02:07.542 --> 02:11.545
Well, don't worry-- your sordid
gambling past will be our secret.

02:11.546 --> 02:14.214
I'm glad to know I can trust you.
Well, of course you can.

02:14.215 --> 02:16.817
Hey, I never told him about your
little soft-core film career.

02:16.818 --> 02:18.718
Oh, God.

02:18.719 --> 02:21.088
You saw <i>Cinnamon's Buns?</i>

02:21.089 --> 02:24.524
Not all the way through.

02:26.561 --> 02:28.462
Although I am
very familiar with

02:28.463 --> 02:30.964
the bakery shop scene
in the middle.

02:31.899 --> 02:34.067
You know, with
the frosting gun?

02:34.068 --> 02:36.470
I was 19, I needed the money.

02:36.471 --> 02:38.805
They promised me
it would be tasteful.

02:38.806 --> 02:40.707
It looked very tasteful.

02:40.708 --> 02:43.009
And delicious.

02:43.010 --> 02:45.579
Yum, yum.

02:45.580 --> 02:47.581
Glad to hear you enjoyed it.

02:47.582 --> 02:49.583
Oh, yeah. Although I don't
think you were well-served

02:49.584 --> 02:50.684
by the screenplay.

02:50.685 --> 02:52.018
What screenplay?

02:52.019 --> 02:54.254
There was just a greasy
little guy behind the camera

02:54.255 --> 02:56.223
saying, "Do this, do that.
More frosting."

02:57.024 --> 03:00.127
It's kind of weird.
In some way,

03:00.128 --> 03:03.196
you and I have more in common
than you and my brother.

03:03.197 --> 03:06.867
All right, let's take something
off the table right away.

03:06.868 --> 03:08.602
What's that?
My ass.

03:08.603 --> 03:10.770
That's not what
I was getting at...

03:10.771 --> 03:12.873
Seriously, Charlie,
in spite of my past,

03:12.874 --> 03:15.275
I'm just a nice
little Valley soccer mom now.

03:15.276 --> 03:17.544
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
soccer mom?

03:17.545 --> 03:19.913
Your kid's a
babbling pothead.

03:19.914 --> 03:21.414
He played soccer
when he was ten.

03:21.415 --> 03:22.682
He scored two goals.

03:22.683 --> 03:23.717
In one game?

03:23.718 --> 03:24.818
In one season. Shut up.

03:24.819 --> 03:26.920
The point is,

03:26.921 --> 03:28.488
I am way past guys like you.

03:28.489 --> 03:30.590
What do you mean
guys like me?

03:30.591 --> 03:32.826
I mean guys that I have
to dip in ammonia

03:32.827 --> 03:34.427
before I'd let them
anywhere near me.

03:34.428 --> 03:36.796
Oh. Those guys.

03:38.232 --> 03:40.066
Well, as long as
we're being honest,

03:40.067 --> 03:42.369
I'm perfectly happy with the
way things are between us.

03:42.370 --> 03:44.437
Besides, you're
really good for Alan.

03:44.438 --> 03:45.972
Thank you.
Yeah, yeah, no,

03:45.973 --> 03:48.475
y-you're, you're smart,
you're strong,

03:48.476 --> 03:52.646
you're self-sufficient,
and he's, well... not.

03:52.647 --> 03:54.548
I think
you underestimate your brother.

03:54.549 --> 03:57.150
It's not an estimate.
I already got the bill.

03:57.151 --> 04:00.086
You'll see, one of these days
he's gonna surprise you.

04:00.087 --> 04:02.689
And one of these days I'm
gonna die of liver failure.

04:02.690 --> 04:04.758
Want to lay odds
which happens first?

04:05.993 --> 04:09.062
Good night, Charlie.
Good night.

No reason. Just trying to keep

Don't worry,

Oh. I'll call you
after work.

05:36.953 --> 05:38.153
See ya, Charlie.

05:38.154 --> 05:40.122
Hey, Lynds, has your son
picked a college yet?

05:40.123 --> 05:41.790
Uh, no. Why?

05:42.492 --> 05:44.126
Well, I was
just wondering

05:44.127 --> 05:46.695
if he were to choose
between say...

05:48.030 --> 05:50.465
North Carolina and Kentucky...

05:51.934 --> 05:54.136
...which one would you encourage
him to pick?

05:54.137 --> 05:55.837
Keeping in mind that as
an out-of-state resident,

05:55.838 --> 05:57.906
Kentucky is two-and-a-half times
more expensive.

05:59.342 --> 06:03.011
I'd still go with Kentucky.
It's a better school.

06:03.012 --> 06:04.513
Interesting.

06:04.514 --> 06:06.882
Well, I hope he gets in.

06:06.883 --> 06:08.583
Thanks. Bye.

06:08.584 --> 06:10.419
Bye.

06:10.420 --> 06:12.788
What was that all about?
Hmm?

06:12.789 --> 06:15.424
Since when do you care
about her kid's education?

06:15.425 --> 06:16.758
Young people are our future,
Alan.

06:16.759 --> 06:17.993
I care about them all.

06:17.994 --> 06:20.929
Oh, please. The only young
people you care about

06:20.930 --> 06:24.132
are sliding down a pole to grab
dollar bills out of your mouth.

06:24.133 --> 06:28.069
Those aren't dollar bills--
those are 20s.

06:29.338 --> 06:30.739
And when did you become
such a cynic?

06:30.740 --> 06:32.207
And when did you become
so interested

06:32.208 --> 06:33.942
in the comings and goings
of my girlfriend--

06:33.943 --> 06:35.410
or what her kid's up to?

06:35.411 --> 06:36.778
Whoa, whoa, chill.

06:36.779 --> 06:38.079
No, no, I will not chill.

06:38.080 --> 06:40.315
And what was all that about
liking having her around?

06:40.316 --> 06:42.083
Nothing.
I like having her around.

06:42.084 --> 06:44.286
Yeah, but around what?

06:44.287 --> 06:45.487
Excuse me?

06:45.488 --> 06:48.623
I think when you say "around,"
you mean under.

06:48.624 --> 06:50.859
Don't go down that road, Alan.

06:50.860 --> 06:52.794
Oh, oh, why shouldn't
I go down that road?

06:52.795 --> 06:55.197
Is it slippery when wet?

06:55.198 --> 06:57.799
Are you out of your mind?
What's gotten into you?

06:57.800 --> 07:00.602
Oh, I think a better question
would be what's gotten into you?

07:00.603 --> 07:03.271
I mean, who have you
gotten into?

07:03.272 --> 07:05.807
Alan, Alan, listen to me
very carefully.

07:05.808 --> 07:08.009
I have not had sex
with your girlfriend.

07:08.010 --> 07:09.344
Oh, so it's still
in the planning stages.

07:09.345 --> 07:10.745
No.
But you do want her?

07:10.746 --> 07:12.614
No.
Why not? What's wrong with her?

07:12.615 --> 07:15.116
Nothing. She's terrific.

07:15.117 --> 07:16.718
So you do want her!

07:16.719 --> 07:18.854
Alan, believe me,
when it comes to Lyndsey,

07:18.855 --> 07:21.089
you have absolutely nothing
to worry about.

07:21.090 --> 07:23.692
Uh-huh, uh-huh. That's what
you said about Wendy Freidman

07:23.693 --> 07:25.694
and Kathy Bell
and Amy Driskell.

07:25.695 --> 07:26.862
Who?

07:26.863 --> 07:28.964
They're all girls that
you stole from me.

07:28.965 --> 07:30.031
What are you talking about?

07:30.032 --> 07:31.032
I never stole anybody from you.

07:31.033 --> 07:32.801
Wendy Freidman.

07:32.802 --> 07:34.503
Sixth grade,
Halloween party.

07:34.504 --> 07:35.737
I went to get her punch.
When I came back,

07:35.738 --> 07:37.506
you were bobbing
for her apples.

07:37.507 --> 07:39.741
Innocent fun.

07:39.742 --> 07:41.877
Oh... Kathy Bell,
ninth grade.

07:41.878 --> 07:43.178
I brought her home to work
on our science project.

07:43.179 --> 07:44.379
I went to the bathroom.

07:44.380 --> 07:46.515
When I came back, you
were teaching her French.

07:46.516 --> 07:48.750
Harmless horseplay.

07:48.751 --> 07:50.986
Amy Driskell,
sophomore year.

07:50.987 --> 07:52.687
First girl who let me
get to second base.

07:52.688 --> 07:54.556
All right, her I nailed.

07:54.557 --> 07:57.359
Wait, wait, wait.
You nailed her?

07:57.360 --> 07:59.928
Everybody nailed her.
That was her thing.

07:59.929 --> 08:01.997
It took me six months

08:01.998 --> 08:03.265
just to touch her right boob!

08:03.266 --> 08:06.167
Wow, you really missed
the signals, didn't you?

08:06.168 --> 08:07.168
What signals?

08:07.169 --> 08:08.270
Well, in my case,

08:08.271 --> 08:09.571
it was her
taking off her sweater

08:09.572 --> 08:11.206
and saying, "Quick, do me
before Alan gets back

08:11.207 --> 08:12.474
from his trumpet lesson."

08:17.079 --> 08:19.614
Clarinet. I didn't have
the lip for trumpet.

08:19.615 --> 08:21.850
Apparently, you didn't have the
lip for Amy Driskell, either.

08:23.886 --> 08:26.421
But all that
was a long time ago.

08:26.422 --> 08:28.490
You're with Lyndsey now,
and what's important

08:28.491 --> 08:30.926
is that I wish you both
a long and happy life together.

08:30.927 --> 08:33.061
Really?
From the bottom of my heart.

08:33.062 --> 08:35.764
Okay.

08:35.765 --> 08:37.097
Thank you.

08:37.099 --> 08:39.534
You're welcome.

08:41.136 --> 08:42.837
Though I'd still like you
to move out.

08:42.837 --> 08:45.507
Got it.

08:47.510 --> 08:48.910
Soon.

08:48.911 --> 08:50.178
Right.

08:53.549 --> 08:55.884
No, I guess that's about it.

08:57.987 --> 08:59.354
Amy Driskell.

08:59.355 --> 09:02.791

♪ Men. ♪

09:07.063 --> 09:09.164
Come on in.

09:09.165 --> 09:10.432
Hey.

09:10.433 --> 09:12.667
Wow, the place looks great.

09:12.668 --> 09:14.536
Doesn't it?

09:15.371 --> 09:17.272
Even better than
before I accidentally

09:17.273 --> 09:19.274
almost burned it
to the ground.

09:19.275 --> 09:21.409
Yeah.

09:21.410 --> 09:22.944
You're welcome.

09:22.945 --> 09:24.512
Come here.

09:24.513 --> 09:26.214
I want to give
you something.

09:26.215 --> 09:27.649
Oh. Fooling around?

09:27.650 --> 09:29.184
On the new couch?

09:29.185 --> 09:30.685
Get your mind
out of the gutter.

09:30.686 --> 09:31.886
I haven't Scotchgarded yet.

09:31.887 --> 09:33.688
Oh.

09:33.689 --> 09:34.889
Here.

09:34.890 --> 09:36.324
A house key?

09:36.325 --> 09:38.593
Uh-huh.
For this house?

09:38.594 --> 09:41.329
Maybe we're not ready
to move in together,

09:41.330 --> 09:43.264
but I want you to feel
like you can come and go

09:43.265 --> 09:44.332
without checking in with me.

09:44.333 --> 09:46.534
Wow. Wow. Thank you.

09:46.535 --> 09:50.005
In a lot of ways, this isn't
just the key to your house,

09:50.006 --> 09:52.240
it's the key to your heart.

09:52.241 --> 09:54.976
Don't gay it up.

09:56.879 --> 09:58.947
Now listen,
I'm thinking of having

09:58.948 --> 10:00.315
a housewarming party
next Saturday.

10:00.316 --> 10:01.483
Great. What can I do?

10:01.484 --> 10:02.717
You can help me
with the guest list.

10:02.718 --> 10:03.885
Okay.

10:03.886 --> 10:05.487
What would you say
about inviting

10:05.488 --> 10:07.455
Judith and Herb?
My ex-wife?

10:07.456 --> 10:08.823
They live right
across the street,

10:08.824 --> 10:10.358
and Herb is always
so sweet to me.

10:10.359 --> 10:12.060
That's because every time
Herb looks at you,

10:12.061 --> 10:14.229
he's pretending
you're wet and naked.

10:14.230 --> 10:16.231
All right. Fine.
I won't invite him.

10:16.232 --> 10:18.066
It would probably just
upset Judith anyway.

10:18.067 --> 10:19.267
Yeah, you're right.

10:19.268 --> 10:21.503
You know what?
Let's invite them.

10:22.238 --> 10:23.672
Take the high road.

10:23.673 --> 10:25.707
All right.
What about Berta?

10:25.708 --> 10:27.342
Oh, no. I don't think so.

10:27.343 --> 10:29.244
Why not?
She's kind of mean to me.

10:29.245 --> 10:30.545
Oh, honey.

10:30.546 --> 10:32.447
That's just 'cause
she doesn't like you.

10:32.448 --> 10:34.783
Fine. Berta.

10:34.784 --> 10:36.384
And Jake.

10:36.385 --> 10:38.420
Oh, of course. Great.
And Charlie.

10:38.421 --> 10:40.355
There it is.

10:40.356 --> 10:41.322
There what is?

10:41.323 --> 10:42.924
Charlie. Why do
you want Charlie

10:42.925 --> 10:44.125
to come to your party?

10:44.126 --> 10:45.360
Why wouldn't I?
When this place burned down,

10:45.361 --> 10:46.528
he took us in.

10:46.529 --> 10:47.862
He took me in seven years ago,

10:47.863 --> 10:50.031
and I don't feel a need
to invite him.

10:50.032 --> 10:51.599
Oh, come on.

10:51.600 --> 10:53.568
He's a great guy.
I really like him.

10:53.569 --> 10:55.503
Of course you do.
All the women like Charlie.

10:55.504 --> 10:56.638
"All the women"?

Who?

11:00.643 --> 11:02.944
And now Lyndsey MacElroy.

11:02.945 --> 11:03.978
Oh, please.

11:03.979 --> 11:05.346
Charlie and I are just friends.

11:05.347 --> 11:07.549
Oh, no, no, no, my brother
does not befriend women,

11:07.550 --> 11:08.550
he befouls them.

11:08.551 --> 11:11.853
Are you saying
you don't trust me?

11:11.854 --> 11:13.722
Oh, no, no, no,
I don't trust Charlie.

11:13.723 --> 11:15.290
For him,
you're unexplored territory.

11:15.291 --> 11:18.193
At some point, he's gonna try
and plant his flag in you.

11:19.195 --> 11:21.529
And when I say "flag,"
I mean his...

11:23.365 --> 11:24.733
...flag.

11:24.734 --> 11:28.236
Okay, you're out of your mind.

11:28.237 --> 11:29.370
Yeah, well, be that as it may,

11:29.371 --> 11:31.039
I do not want you hanging out
with my brother.

11:31.040 --> 11:33.208
I mean, you know, you
can be courteous to him.

11:33.209 --> 11:34.209
You know, like, "Hey, Charlie,

11:34.210 --> 11:35.710
you got some vomit
on your shoe,"

11:35.711 --> 11:38.379
or, you know, "Hey, Charlie,
do you need me to move my car

11:38.380 --> 11:40.615
so your hooker can park
her pink Camaro?"

11:40.616 --> 11:43.084
Do you realize
how insulting this is?

11:43.085 --> 11:46.121
You don't get to tell me who I
can and can't be friends with.

11:46.122 --> 11:48.223
Hey, it's just Charlie.
I gave you Herb and Berta.

11:48.224 --> 11:50.925
You know what, I made a mistake.

11:50.926 --> 11:53.094
Well, I forgive you.

11:53.095 --> 11:55.230
Give me my key back.

11:55.231 --> 11:56.965
What?
Give it to me.

11:56.966 --> 11:58.199
Then how can I
come and go?

11:58.200 --> 12:00.502
You can forget coming,
you're just gonna be going.

12:00.503 --> 12:01.770
But I-I don't
understand.

12:01.771 --> 12:03.004
We were doing so good.

12:03.005 --> 12:05.740
We were, then you started
talking and spoiled it.

12:05.741 --> 12:08.243
Okay, okay,
ju-just to clarify--

12:08.244 --> 12:09.611
you're not as angry with me now

12:09.612 --> 12:11.880
as you were when I
burned down your house?

12:13.649 --> 12:17.118
Okay, we'll talk after
you've gained some perspective.

12:33.004 --> 12:34.004
Why not?

12:34.005 --> 12:35.439

I will never speak to you again.

12:45.783 --> 12:47.250
Oh, really?

12:47.251 --> 12:48.885

12:50.421 --> 12:52.255
You know what I'm talking about.

12:52.256 --> 12:54.057
All right, all right,

12:54.058 --> 12:56.493
I'm gonna run this down for you
one last time.

12:56.494 --> 12:58.595
I have no interest in Lyndsey
other than as a friend,

12:58.596 --> 13:00.130
and she has even less
interest in me.

13:00.131 --> 13:01.498
I don't believe you.

13:01.499 --> 13:02.732
Okay, fine, you're right.

13:02.733 --> 13:03.934
I'm going over
to your girlfriend's house,

13:03.935 --> 13:05.268
and I'm gonna do her
right on the couch!

13:05.269 --> 13:07.504
No, you won't.
Why not?

13:07.505 --> 13:09.573
Couch isn't Scotchgarded yet.

13:11.609 --> 13:13.910
Hey, Charlie, did you remember
to get the housewarming gift?

13:13.911 --> 13:15.579
Jake's got it. Jake!

13:21.285 --> 13:22.219
Very funny.

13:22.220 --> 13:23.920
We thought so.

13:24.989 --> 13:26.189
How come you
aren't dressed?

13:26.190 --> 13:27.491
He and Lyndsey had a fight.

13:27.492 --> 13:28.959
Oh. That sucks.

13:28.960 --> 13:30.460
See ya.

13:31.362 --> 13:32.362
So you're just gonna

13:32.363 --> 13:33.430
sit here all night?

13:33.431 --> 13:34.698
Oh, I'll be fine.

13:34.699 --> 13:36.166
Oh, I'm sure you will.

13:36.167 --> 13:39.269
But if you get bored, there's
a load of laundry in the dryer

13:39.270 --> 13:40.837
you could fluff and fold.

13:40.838 --> 13:43.073
So you want me to do your job?

13:43.074 --> 13:45.475
Somebody has to.

13:46.444 --> 13:48.879
Well, I guess there's nothing

13:48.880 --> 13:52.782
left to say except
you're an idiot.

13:54.585 --> 13:57.420
I may be an idiot,
but at least I'm home by myself

13:57.421 --> 14:00.924
reading <i>Moby Dick.</i>

14:00.925 --> 14:03.126
Upside down.

14:08.466 --> 14:10.667
Might as well.

she's giving Wanda?

15:00.551 --> 15:01.785
Oh.

an opening.

15:03.854 --> 15:05.522

15:05.523 --> 15:07.390

I see an opening.

so you can look down my dress
and see my boobies?"

15:24.275 --> 15:27.844
"Why, thank you,
I believe I will."

15:27.845 --> 15:32.215

or wait until after the party""

16:01.545 --> 16:05.782
Uh, there's, there's certainly
no reason to feel threatened.

16:06.684 --> 16:08.184
Good skunk.

16:08.185 --> 16:09.619

16:42.153 --> 16:43.720

And by "migraine,"
I mean "bitch fit."

16:53.497 --> 16:55.298
Got it.

16:55.299 --> 16:56.466
How about you?

16:56.467 --> 16:57.834
Oh, Lyndsey and I

16:57.835 --> 16:59.302
had kind of a falling-out.

16:59.303 --> 17:02.205
'Cause you showed up
smelling like a skunk?

17:02.206 --> 17:04.340
No, no. Long story.

17:04.342 --> 17:06.175
I got time.

17:06.176 --> 17:08.178

17:28.232 --> 17:30.266

for getting rid of skunk smell?

17:41.879 --> 17:43.046
Tomato juice.

17:43.047 --> 17:44.180
Great. You got any?

17:44.181 --> 17:45.582
No.

Think that'll work?

17:48.853 --> 17:50.220
Well, it sure doesn't taste

17:50.221 --> 17:51.421
like tomato juice,

17:51.422 --> 17:53.423
but you couldn't possibly
smell any worse.

17:53.424 --> 17:54.691
Hang on.

17:54.692 --> 17:56.025
Oh!

17:56.026 --> 17:58.762
What else could go wrong?

17:58.763 --> 18:00.897
Of course.

I'm standing in dog crap.

back together.

18:13.444 --> 18:15.678

Not really.

better than this.

18:35.132 --> 18:37.734

I was hoping.

Where is he?

18:47.344 --> 18:48.711
Where is who?

18:48.712 --> 18:50.013
What is that smell?

18:50.014 --> 18:53.149
Skunk, dog crap and ketchup.
Oh.

20 minutes ago with two women.

Really?

19:01.959 --> 19:03.560
Really.

telling you, you smelly fool!

You don't scare me.

19:33.858 --> 19:35.658
You already shot your load.

you could be a different skunk.

Alan's paranoia is not
completely uncalled for.

19:57.006 --> 19:58.306
No, no, this wasn't paranoia.

19:58.307 --> 19:59.641
This was insanity.

I know, I know, but...
The man was covered in ketchup.

20:02.578 --> 20:05.513
Well, to be fair,
there was a time in your life

20:05.514 --> 20:07.282
when you were covered
in frosting.

20:07.283 --> 20:09.017
It's not the same thing.

20:09.018 --> 20:11.519

Now, if you ever repeat this,
I will deny it,

20:17.693 --> 20:20.628
but my brother is about the
most decent human being I know.

Can't you just give
him one more chance?

20:22.865 --> 20:24.566
Well, I suppose.
