00:02.700 --> 00:05.433
[tv announcer
speaking indistinctly]

00:05.433 --> 00:06.967
- THE GAME STARTED ALREADY?

00:06.967 --> 00:08.667
- NO, THEY'RE WAITING FOR YOU.

00:11.233 --> 00:13.233
- HI, GUYS.

00:13.233 --> 00:14.700
- HEY, BLUBBERHEAD.

00:14.700 --> 00:16.600

00:16.600 --> 00:18.333
DON'T FILL UP
ON TOO MUCH JUNK FOOD

00:18.333 --> 00:20.600
'CAUSE I'M
COOKING US DINNER.

00:20.600 --> 00:22.633
- YOU CALL HER BLUBBERHEAD
AND GET A KISS?

00:22.633 --> 00:24.100
- HA. YEAH.

00:24.100 --> 00:26.367
YEAH, IT'S FUNNY, I COULD

00:26.367 --> 00:28.933
AS LONG AS I GIVE IT THAT,

00:28.933 --> 00:32.200
"HEY, BLUBBERHEAD."

00:32.200 --> 00:33.500
- HEY, WAIT A MINUTE,
WAIT A MINUTE.

00:33.500 --> 00:34.600
YOU COULDN'T
JUST CALL HER ANYTHING.

00:34.600 --> 00:36.033
- YEAH, YEAH.
NO, I COULD.

00:36.033 --> 00:38.267
SHE JUST HEARS
THE CUTE TONE, YOU KNOW?

00:38.267 --> 00:40.267
SHE DOESN'T REALLY
HEAR THE WORD.

00:44.200 --> 00:48.600
- HOW ABOUT "FAT LEGS"?

00:48.600 --> 00:49.667
- WHAT?

00:49.667 --> 00:51.800
- YOU COULDN'T CALL HER
"FAT LEGS."

00:51.800 --> 00:55.400
- YEAH, I COULD,
AS LONG AS I CUTESY IT UP.

00:55.400 --> 00:56.900
- NO WAY.

00:56.900 --> 00:58.633
- HEY, I THINK WE--

00:58.633 --> 01:01.733

THE CHOCOLATE MILK, FAT LEGS.

01:05.200 --> 01:07.100
- OKAY, I'LL PICK UP
SOME MORE TOMORROW.

01:07.967 --> 01:08.967
- [chuckling]
- WOW.

01:08.967 --> 01:10.733
- THAT'S UNBELIEVABLE!

01:10.733 --> 01:12.200
- LET'S TRY ANOTHER ONE.

01:12.200 --> 01:13.933
- YEAH, LET'S SEE HOW FAR
YOU CAN PUSH IT.

01:13.933 --> 01:16.233
- ALL RIGHT, WHAT HAVE YOU GOT?
I'M TELLING YOU, IT'S FOOLPROOF.

01:16.233 --> 01:18.067
- HEY, COME ON, RAY.
SHE'S GONNA GET MAD.

01:18.067 --> 01:19.433
- SMELLY.
HOW ABOUT SMELLY?

01:19.433 --> 01:21.000
- ALL RIGHT, ALL RIGHT,
I'LL TRY SMELLY.

01:21.000 --> 01:23.767
- NO, NO.
IT'S TOO EASY.

01:23.767 --> 01:25.633
TRAMPY.

01:25.633 --> 01:26.633
TRY TRAMPY.

01:26.633 --> 01:28.200
- GUYS, GUYS, COME ON.

01:28.200 --> 01:29.567
- I GOT IT, I GOT IT.

01:29.567 --> 01:31.667
"SMELLY TRAMP."

01:31.667 --> 01:34.833
- OH, BOY.
- NO, NO, IT CAN HAPPEN.

01:34.833 --> 01:36.367
- RAY, DID YOU PICK UP THE MAIL?

01:36.367 --> 01:38.500
- YEAH, IT'S OVER THERE.

01:42.033 --> 01:44.267
NOTHING BUT BILLS TODAY,
SMELLY TRAMP.

01:45.300 --> 01:47.700
- I KNOW.
WE ALWAYS GET SO MUCH--

02:00.967 --> 02:02.100
- ROBERT MADE ME DO IT.

02:07.467 --> 02:09.900
I WASN'T TRYING
TO HUMILIATE YOU.

02:09.900 --> 02:11.200
- OH, SO I SHOULD BE FLATTERED

02:11.200 --> 02:15.400
THAT MY HUSBAND CALLS ME
A "SMELLY TRAMP"?

02:15.400 --> 02:19.233
- FIRST OF ALL,
I DIDN'T CALL YOU THAT.

02:19.233 --> 02:22.200
I CALLED YOU
"THMELLY TRAMP"!

02:25.233 --> 02:26.900
COME ON.
I'M SORRY, ALL RIGHT?

02:26.900 --> 02:29.633
- IT'S JUST THAT YOU'RE
SO IMMATURE ALL THE TIME.

02:29.633 --> 02:32.500
- THAT'S NOT TRUE, ALL RIGHT?
IT ISN'T.

02:32.500 --> 02:33.533
- OH, NO?

02:33.533 --> 02:35.233
WHO MADE GEOFFREY CRY
AT CHRISTMAS

02:35.233 --> 02:37.267
BECAUSE DADDY HAD TO TRY
THE TOY AIRPLANE

02:37.267 --> 02:40.600
BEFORE ANYBODY ELSE?

02:40.600 --> 02:43.333
- HEY, IT TOOK TWO HOURS
TO PUT THE DAMN THING TOGETHER.

02:43.333 --> 02:45.933
I CAN'T GET ONE THROW?

02:45.933 --> 02:49.500
- AND WHO DOES THE HYSTERICAL
NURSERY RHYMES FOR THE KIDS?

02:49.500 --> 02:51.433
"LITTLE JACK HORNER
SAT IN THE CORNER,

02:51.433 --> 02:54.300
SOMETHING, SOMETHING,
POOP AND PEE."

02:56.067 --> 02:59.667
- YOU GOT TO GIVE THE PEOPLE
WHAT THEY WANT.

03:01.067 --> 03:03.533
- HOW ABOUT SETTING
AN EXAMPLE FOR THEM?

03:03.533 --> 03:05.367
- I'M A GREAT EXAMPLE, OKAY?

03:05.367 --> 03:06.800
YEAH, I KID AROUND,

03:06.800 --> 03:09.233
BUT WHEN IT'S CRUNCH TIME,
I'M RIGHT THERE.

03:09.233 --> 03:10.633
- OH, YEAH,
LIKE THE OTHER DAY

03:10.633 --> 03:13.067
WHEN ALLY WAS ASKING YOU
HOW BABIES GET HERE,

03:13.067 --> 03:14.767
AND YOU SUDDENLY
HAD A SNEEZE ATTACK

03:14.767 --> 03:17.600
AND RAN OUT OF THE ROOM?

03:17.600 --> 03:21.133
- SO I SHOULD JUST SNEEZE
ON MY DAUGHTER?

03:21.133 --> 03:23.333
- WHATEVER.
GOOD NIGHT.

03:25.867 --> 03:28.667
- WHAT, YOU WANT ME TO HAVE
THE SEX TALK WITH HER?

03:28.667 --> 03:30.433
- YEAH, RIGHT.

03:30.433 --> 03:31.833
- WHAT, YOU DON'T THINK
I CAN DO IT?

03:31.833 --> 03:34.167
I CAN DO IT;
I'LL HAVE THE SEX TALK WITH HER.

03:34.167 --> 03:35.833
- YOU KNOW WHAT, RAY,
YOU CAN BE THERE,

03:35.833 --> 03:38.033
AND I'LL EXPLAIN IT
TO THE BOTH OF YOU.

03:46.467 --> 03:48.900
- YOU KNOW WHAT?
I'M GONNA DO IT.

03:48.900 --> 03:52.467
- RAY, THIS IS NOT SOMETHING
TO BE COMPETITIVE ABOUT,

03:52.467 --> 03:53.433
SO STOP IT.

03:53.433 --> 03:55.033
- NO. NO!
YOU STOP IT, ALL RIGHT?

03:55.033 --> 03:56.700
YOU SAY THAT
I'M AN IMMATURE PARENT,

03:56.700 --> 03:58.767
AND NOW I WANT TO DO
SOMETHING FOR MY CHILD

03:58.767 --> 04:00.967
THAT'S IMPORTANT
AND IT'S RESPONSIBLE,

04:00.967 --> 04:02.300
AND YOU WON'T LET ME?

04:12.400 --> 04:13.367
- HERE.

04:13.367 --> 04:14.767
- WHAT?
WHAT'S THIS?

04:14.767 --> 04:16.900
- IT'S A BOOK I WAS READING
ABOUT THIS.

04:16.900 --> 04:19.300
- REALLY? A BOOK?

04:19.300 --> 04:21.600
- UH, YEAH.
YOU HAVE TO PREPARE.

04:21.600 --> 04:24.567
YOU CAN'T JUST GO IN THERE
AND DO A PUPPET SHOW.

04:28.700 --> 04:31.433
- ALL RIGHT.

04:31.433 --> 04:37.533
YEAH, YEAH, THIS ALL
LOOKS FAMILIAR...

04:37.533 --> 04:41.033
ALTHOUGH
IT'S BEEN A WHILE.

04:42.400 --> 04:44.967
HEY, HOW DO YOU
PRONOUNCE THAT AGAIN?

04:44.967 --> 04:49.967
- FALLOPIAN.

04:49.967 --> 04:53.233
- NOT "FALL-AH-PIAN"?

04:53.233 --> 04:55.033
RIGHT, RIGHT.
FALLOPIAN, YEAH.

04:59.800 --> 05:01.833
[knocking]

05:01.833 --> 05:03.867
ALLY?

05:03.867 --> 05:04.967
- HI, DADDY.

05:04.967 --> 05:06.800
- HI.
WHATCHA DOIN'?

05:06.800 --> 05:08.467
- JUST PLAYING WITH MY DOLLS.

05:08.467 --> 05:10.133
- OH, GOOD.

05:10.133 --> 05:12.833
GOOD.

05:12.833 --> 05:14.467
LISTEN, UM,

05:14.467 --> 05:16.733
THE OTHER DAY
YOU ASKED QUESTIONS

05:16.733 --> 05:18.800
ABOUT BABIES AND STUFF.

05:18.800 --> 05:20.967
- WHEN YOU STARTED SNEEZING?

05:20.967 --> 05:22.800
- YEAH.

05:22.800 --> 05:24.467
YES, YEAH.

05:24.467 --> 05:26.300
UM, ANYWAY,

05:26.300 --> 05:28.700
I WAS WONDERING IF YOU WANTED
TO TALK ABOUT THAT NOW.

05:28.700 --> 05:30.167
- OKAY.

05:30.167 --> 05:31.600
- [sighs]

05:31.600 --> 05:33.633
GOOD, GOOD.

05:33.633 --> 05:37.300
LET ME TRY TO EXPLAIN
A FEW THINGS.

05:43.200 --> 05:48.867
ALL RIGHT.

05:48.867 --> 05:51.033
OKAY.

05:51.033 --> 05:52.900
HERE'S WHAT HAPPENS.

05:52.900 --> 05:56.833
WHEN A MAN AND A WOMAN
LOVE EACH OTHER VERY MUCH,

05:56.833 --> 05:58.267
THEY GET MARRIED,

05:58.267 --> 06:03.000
AND THEN SOMETIMES
THEY DECIDE TO MAKE A BABY.

06:03.000 --> 06:04.133
- WHY ARE THERE BABIES?

06:04.133 --> 06:05.367
- RIGHT, RIGHT.

06:05.367 --> 06:08.467
OKAY, I'M GONNA GET TO THAT.

06:08.467 --> 06:10.200
OKAY.

06:10.200 --> 06:12.233
WHAT A MAN
AND A WOMAN DO IS--

06:12.233 --> 06:15.133
- NO, I MEAN, I KNOW THAT
THE MAN AND THE WOMAN

06:15.133 --> 06:17.567
HAVE TO DO SOMETHING, BUT...

06:17.567 --> 06:19.100
WHY ARE WE BORN?

06:19.100 --> 06:21.767
WHY HAS GOD PUT US HERE?

06:36.200 --> 06:38.067
- BECAUSE...

06:38.067 --> 06:40.533
THAT'S...

06:40.533 --> 06:43.033
WHAT?

06:46.533 --> 06:49.200
- IF WE ALL GO TO HEAVEN
WHEN WE DIE,

06:49.200 --> 06:52.100
THEN WHY DOES GOD
WANT US HERE FIRST?

06:58.800 --> 07:02.467
- UM...

07:02.467 --> 07:05.633
WHY DOES GOD WANT US HERE?

07:05.633 --> 07:07.533
- YEAH, WHY?

07:19.600 --> 07:20.600
WHY ARE WE HERE, DADDY?

07:20.600 --> 07:23.167
- YEAH, I HEARD YOU,
I HEARD YOU.

07:25.733 --> 07:29.333
YOU DON'T WANT TO TALK
ABOUT SEX?

07:31.767 --> 07:33.000
- NO.

07:33.000 --> 07:38.267
- YOU EVER HEAR
THE WORD "FALLOPIAN"?

07:38.267 --> 07:41.833
OKAY.
ALL RIGHT.

07:41.833 --> 07:43.500
OKAY,
YOU REALLY WANT TO KNOW

07:43.500 --> 07:45.600
WHY GOD WANTS US HERE FIRST.

07:46.667 --> 07:49.333
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION.

07:49.333 --> 07:52.233
YOU SEE,
GOD IS UP IN HEAVEN,

07:52.233 --> 07:55.900
AND, WELL, HONEY...

07:55.900 --> 07:58.233
IT'S VERY CROWDED UP THERE.

08:03.033 --> 08:05.100
- IT IS?

08:05.100 --> 08:07.000
- YEAH. YEAH.

08:07.000 --> 08:08.400
AND YOU DON'T WANT
TO BE IN HEAVEN

08:08.400 --> 08:10.333
IF IT'S CROWDED, RIGHT?

08:10.333 --> 08:11.967
REMEMBER WHEN WE
WENT TO DISNEY WORLD,

08:11.967 --> 08:14.633
HOW CROWDED THAT WAS?

08:14.633 --> 08:17.833
I MEAN, IT WAS FUN,
BUT IT WAS TOO CROWDED, RIGHT?

08:17.833 --> 08:24.000
SO GOD, HE SENDS US DOWN TO
EARTH FOR A LITTLE WHILE TO...

08:24.000 --> 08:28.067
EASE THE HEAVENLY CONGESTION.

08:36.933 --> 08:39.033
- WHAT?

08:43.200 --> 08:44.300
- [feigns sneezing]

08:44.300 --> 08:46.600
OH, HERE WE GO AGAIN!
AH-CHOO!

08:46.600 --> 08:48.500
I DON'T WANT TO--
AH-CHOO!

08:48.500 --> 08:49.900
I DON'T WANT YOU
TO CATCH THIS.

08:49.900 --> 08:52.400
I DON'T WANT YOU TO--
AH-CHOO!

08:52.400 --> 08:55.067
I'LL BE BACK IN A MINUTE.
AH-CHOO!

09:00.433 --> 09:02.967
AH-CHOO!

09:02.967 --> 09:04.467
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

09:04.467 --> 09:07.267
YOU WERE ONLY UP THERE LIKE--
- I GOT BLINDSIDED!

09:07.267 --> 09:08.600
- WHAT?
WHAT DO YOU MEAN?

09:08.600 --> 09:10.333
- ALLY DIDN'T WANT
TO TALK ABOUT SEX.

09:10.333 --> 09:12.233
SHE STARTED ASKING
QUESTIONS ABOUT LIFE,

09:12.233 --> 09:15.933
WHY DID GOD PUT US HERE,
CRAZY STUFF LIKE THAT.

09:15.933 --> 09:17.667
- WOW!
SO WHAT DID YOU SAY?

09:17.667 --> 09:21.000
- I TOLD HER WE'RE HERE
BECAUSE HEAVEN IS CROWDED.

09:23.200 --> 09:24.600
- YOU SAID
HEAVEN IS CROWDED?

09:24.600 --> 09:27.400
- I GOT AMBUSHED!

09:27.400 --> 09:28.867
- OH, MY GOD, RAY,
YOU'VE GOT TO GET BACK UP THERE!

09:28.867 --> 09:30.500
- NO, YOU GO!
YOU GO UP THERE!

09:30.500 --> 09:32.433
- YOU'RE THE ONE THAT WANTED
TO PROVE HE'S MATURE.

09:32.433 --> 09:34.600
WHY CAN'T YOU HAVE THIS
DISCUSSION WITH YOUR DAUGHTER?

09:34.600 --> 09:37.400
- BECAUSE I STUDIED
FOR THE SEX ONE!

09:37.400 --> 09:38.967
I WASN'T READY FOR THIS!

09:38.967 --> 09:41.133
I DON'T JUST HAVE A SWITCH
THAT CAN MAKE ME SMART!

09:41.133 --> 09:42.833
- NO KIDDING.

09:42.833 --> 09:45.167
COME ON, YOU COULDN'T COME UP
WITH ANYTHING?

09:45.167 --> 09:47.667
JUST TELL HER
WE'RE PUT ON EARTH TO...

09:47.667 --> 09:49.633
YOU KNOW, BECAUSE...

09:49.633 --> 09:51.367
- WELL, LOOKY HERE!

09:51.367 --> 09:52.900
YEAH,
LITTLE MISS SMARTY-PANTS!

09:52.900 --> 09:54.733
MAYBE IT IS "FALL-AH-PIAN"!

09:57.700 --> 09:58.500
- HEY.

09:58.500 --> 10:00.067
- GAME'S ON SATELLITE.

10:00.067 --> 10:02.467
- AND I MADE CANNOLIS.

10:02.467 --> 10:04.100
- ACTUALLY, YOU KNOW WHAT,

10:04.100 --> 10:06.067
WE'RE KIND OF IN THE MIDDLE
OF SOMETHING, RIGHT, RAY?

10:06.067 --> 10:07.133
- WHAT,
YOU ONLY MADE FOUR?

10:07.133 --> 10:08.800
- RAY!

10:08.800 --> 10:10.600
- I'M SORRY, IT'S JUST THAT
THERE'S FIVE OF US HERE.

10:10.600 --> 10:12.133
- I MADE SIX,
BUT YOUR FATHER GOT AT 'EM.

10:12.133 --> 10:13.133
- NO.

10:13.133 --> 10:14.500
NO, I DIDN'T.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.067
WELL, THEN,
I GUESS TWO OF THEM HAD WINGS,

10:16.067 --> 10:18.833
'CAUSE THEY JUST FLEW AWAY.

10:18.833 --> 10:22.200
- YEAH, WELL, MAKE ANOTHER
ONE OF THOSE AND CLIMB ABOARD.

10:24.600 --> 10:26.000
- YOU KNOW, YOU KNOW,
YOU KNOW WHAT?

10:26.000 --> 10:27.367
THIS REALLY
IS NOT A GOOD TIME.

10:27.367 --> 10:28.933
- WHY, WHAT'S GOING ON?
WHAT'S WRONG?

10:28.933 --> 10:32.267
- YOU TWO ABOUT TO SHACK IT UP?

10:32.267 --> 10:33.733
- NO, WE'RE NOT SHACKING IT UP.

10:33.733 --> 10:35.133
ALLY JUST STARTED
ASKING SOME QUESTIONS

10:35.133 --> 10:36.500
ABOUT WHERE BABIES COME FROM,

10:36.500 --> 10:38.100
AND RAY WAS GOING TO
TALK TO HER ABOUT IT--

10:38.100 --> 10:43.133
- WAIT A MINUTE, YOU WERE GONNA
TALK TO A CHILD ABOUT S-E-X?

10:43.133 --> 10:44.767
- MARIE,
IF SHE'S ASKING QUESTIONS,

10:44.767 --> 10:45.800
WE HAVE TO ANSWER HER.

10:45.800 --> 10:48.267
- NO, YOU DON'T.

10:48.267 --> 10:50.167
MY BOYS HAD
ALL SORTS OF QUESTIONS,

10:50.167 --> 10:52.200
BUT I HAD FRANK WAIT
UNTIL THEY WERE TEENAGERS

10:52.200 --> 10:53.200
TO TALK TO THEM.

10:53.200 --> 10:56.367
- NOBODY TALKED TO ME.

10:56.367 --> 10:58.567
- YEAH, WHAT?
ME NEITHER.

10:58.567 --> 11:00.967
- FRANK, YOU TOLD ME
YOU'D TALK TO THEM.

11:00.967 --> 11:03.667
- WHY?
WHAT DID THEY NEED TO HEAR?

11:03.667 --> 11:06.833
NO ONE NEEDS TO TELL A BEE
WHERE TO GO TO GET THE HONEY.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.967
AM I RIGHT, RAY?

11:07.967 --> 11:12.133
- ALL RIGHT, DAD,
ALL RIGHT.

11:12.133 --> 11:14.567
- THIS IS TERRIBLE.

11:14.567 --> 11:16.900
YOU KNOW, ROBERT,
THIS MIGHT EXPLAIN

11:16.900 --> 11:18.900
WHY YOU'RE STILL SINGLE.

11:18.900 --> 11:22.467
- WHAT?

11:22.467 --> 11:26.200
- SEXUAL RELATIONS
CAN BE VERY CONFUSING.

11:26.200 --> 11:29.067
I SHOULD HAVE NEVER
LEFT IT UP TO YOUR FATHER.

11:29.067 --> 11:30.400
DO YOU WANT TO TALK?

11:33.800 --> 11:35.433
- YOU KNOW, I WOULD,

11:35.433 --> 11:38.867
BUT I DON'T KNOW WHAT WE'D DO
WITH ALL THE VOMIT.

11:38.867 --> 11:41.733
- YOU KNOW, NO,

11:41.733 --> 11:43.133
CAN WE PLEASE STOP?

11:43.133 --> 11:44.467
LOOK, IT TURNS OUT ALLY
DOESN'T WANT TO KNOW

11:44.467 --> 11:45.500
HOW WE GET HERE.

11:45.500 --> 11:47.367
SHE WANTS TO KNOW
WHY WE'RE HERE,

11:47.367 --> 11:48.767
WHY GOD PUT US ON EARTH,

11:48.767 --> 11:51.067
AND SHE'S WAITING FOR RAY
TO ANSWER HER.

11:51.067 --> 11:52.067
- WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU?

11:52.067 --> 11:53.167
IT'S SIMPLE.

11:53.167 --> 11:54.533
- OH, OKAY.
YEAH.

11:54.533 --> 11:56.167
WE'RE GONNA LEARN
THE MEANING OF LIFE

11:56.167 --> 11:59.400
FROM A GUY WHO ONCE
THREW HIS SHOE AT A SWAN.

11:59.400 --> 12:01.667
- THAT'S CALLED
PROTECTING YOUR SANDWICH.

12:03.133 --> 12:04.167
LISTEN TO ME.

12:04.167 --> 12:05.767
HERE'S WHAT LIFE IS:

12:05.767 --> 12:08.600
YOU'RE BORN, YOU GO TO SCHOOL,
YOU GO TO WORK, YOU DIE.

12:08.600 --> 12:10.700
THAT'S IT.
THAT'S ALL.

12:10.700 --> 12:13.100
CANNOLI, MARIE.

12:15.567 --> 12:17.233
- LISTEN, WE'RE NOT
TALKING ABOUT

12:17.233 --> 12:19.867
WAT WE DO WHILE WE'RE HERE,
DAD.

12:19.867 --> 12:23.467
- YEAH, THE BIG QUESTION IS WHY
WE'RE HERE IN THE FIRST PLACE.

12:23.467 --> 12:25.567
YOU KNOW, I'VE SPENT MANY
A NIGHT LYING IN BED

12:25.567 --> 12:27.733
THINKING ABOUT
THIS KIND OF STUFF,

12:27.733 --> 12:31.967
LIFE'S...IMPONDERABLES.

12:31.967 --> 12:35.100
- YOU NEED TO FIND YOURSELF
A BROAD, AND PRONTO.

12:37.900 --> 12:39.233
- WHERE ARE WE?

12:39.233 --> 12:41.667
WHERE ARE WE
IN THE BIG SCHEME OF THINGS?

12:41.667 --> 12:45.233
- DON'T GOT TO BE A PRETTY ONE,
JUST GRAB SOMETHING.

12:47.200 --> 12:49.867
- I THINK ALLY'S TOO YOUNG TO BE
WORRYING ABOUT THINGS LIKE THIS.

12:49.867 --> 12:51.367
- NO, I'M PROUD OF HER.

12:51.367 --> 12:53.367
I LOVE IT THAT SHE'S SUCH
AN INDEPENDENT THINKER.

12:53.367 --> 12:54.667
- IF SHE'S SO INDEPENDENT,

12:54.667 --> 12:57.400
WHY CAN'T SHE
FIGURE THIS OUT HERSELF?

12:57.400 --> 12:59.500
- RAY, LISTEN, JUST GET UP THERE
AND TELL HER

12:59.500 --> 13:01.133
THAT GOD PUT US ON EARTH
TO HELP EACH OTHER.

13:01.133 --> 13:02.500
IT'S SIMPLE.
IT'S DIRECT.

13:02.500 --> 13:04.367
IT'S A GOOD WAY FOR HER
TO LIVE HER LIFE.

13:04.367 --> 13:05.467
- WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT?

13:05.467 --> 13:07.000
THAT DOESN'T ANSWER ANYTHING!

13:07.000 --> 13:08.733
WHAT, ARE YOU TELLING ME
THAT GOD SAID,

13:08.733 --> 13:10.000
"HMM, EARTH. LET'S SEE.

13:10.000 --> 13:12.200
WHAT SHOULD I PUT THERE?"

13:12.200 --> 13:16.667
- THAT'S YOUR GOD?

13:16.667 --> 13:17.667
- YEAH.

13:17.667 --> 13:18.800
- NO WAY!

13:18.800 --> 13:20.800
IT'S GOT TO BE DEEPER...

13:20.800 --> 13:22.233
AND COOL.

13:22.233 --> 13:24.633
[deep and cool]
"HELLO. I'M GOD."

13:32.333 --> 13:33.900
- KEEP GOING, RAYMOND.

13:33.900 --> 13:36.900
I THINK YOU'RE
A WONDERFUL GOD.

13:36.900 --> 13:37.900
- THANK YOU.

13:37.900 --> 13:39.333
SO WHAT DID GOD SAY?

13:39.333 --> 13:41.100
"HEY, I'M GOING TO PUT
SOME HUMANS ON EARTH

13:41.100 --> 13:42.500
"SO THEY CAN
HELP EACH OTHER.

13:42.500 --> 13:45.133
"OR I COULD JUST
SKIP HUMANS ALTOGETHER

13:45.133 --> 13:47.267
AND GO HIT
A BUCKET OF BALLS."

13:48.700 --> 13:49.733
- OH, I KNOW!

13:49.733 --> 13:53.900
IT'S ALL IN THE BIBLE!

13:53.900 --> 13:56.900
- YOU EVER THINK ABOUT SPACE?

13:56.900 --> 13:58.000
WHAT IS IT?

13:58.000 --> 13:59.333
IS IT REALLY ENDLESS?

13:59.333 --> 14:00.867
I MEAN, IF YOU HAD A SPACESHIP,

14:00.867 --> 14:03.500
COULD YOU GO FLYING AND FLYING
THROUGH SPACE FOREVER?

14:03.500 --> 14:06.200
- WHY DON'T YOU GIVE IT A SHOT?

14:10.733 --> 14:12.033
- NO!

14:12.033 --> 14:13.433
I'M NOT KIDDING AROUND HERE.

14:13.433 --> 14:15.033
I MEAN, HOW CAN SPACE
GO ON FOREVER,

14:15.033 --> 14:16.467
AND IF IT DOESN'T,

14:16.467 --> 14:18.000
THEN WHAT'S AT THE END, HUH?

14:18.000 --> 14:19.300
- STOP IT, ROBERT.

14:19.300 --> 14:22.200
YOU'LL GIVE YOURSELF
A TUMMY ACHE.

14:22.200 --> 14:24.667
- WHAT ABOUT
THE BEGINNING OF TIME?

14:24.667 --> 14:27.100
WHAT WAS THERE BEFORE THAT,
BEFORE TIME?

14:27.100 --> 14:28.500
NOTHING?
I MEAN, WHAT IS NOTHING?

14:28.500 --> 14:29.800
HOW COULD THERE BE NOTHING?

14:29.800 --> 14:32.900
THIS DOESN'T BOTHER
ANYBODY ELSE?

14:32.900 --> 14:34.600
- OKAY, EVERYBODY LISTEN TO ME.

14:34.600 --> 14:37.067
SIT DOWN.

14:37.067 --> 14:38.233
LISTEN.

14:38.233 --> 14:39.467
"IN THE BEGINNING,

14:39.467 --> 14:41.833
GOD CREATED THE HEAVEN
AND THE EARTH."

14:41.833 --> 14:43.433
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:44.900 --> 14:47.100
"LET THERE BE LIGHT."

14:48.233 --> 14:52.133
OKAY, OKAY, OKAY, OKAY.

14:52.133 --> 14:54.967
IT MIGHT TAKE ME
A MINUTE MORE.

14:54.967 --> 14:56.867
- A MINUTE MORE?

14:56.867 --> 14:58.500
MARIE, RELIGIOUS SCHOLARS SPEND
THEIR ENTIRE LIVES

14:58.500 --> 14:59.967
TRYING TO ANSWER THIS QUESTION.

14:59.967 --> 15:01.533
YOU'RE NOT JUST GONNA
FLIP THROUGH THE BIBLE

15:01.533 --> 15:02.733
AND FIND THE MEANING OF LIFE.

15:02.733 --> 15:05.000
- OH, YE OF LITTLE FAITH.

15:05.000 --> 15:07.033
THAT'S IN HERE SOMEWHERE, TOO.

15:08.467 --> 15:09.833
- LOOK, IF YOU WANT TO KNOW
WHAT'S IN THE BIBLE,

15:09.833 --> 15:12.067
WHY DON'T YOU TALK
TO FATHER HUBLEY?

15:12.067 --> 15:13.633
- HEY, THAT'S RIGHT!

15:13.633 --> 15:15.533
YOU KNOW WHAT, IT'S HIS JOB
TO KNOW THESE THINGS.

15:15.533 --> 15:17.633
- WHAT, ARE YOU GONNA CALL HIM?
- YEAH.

15:17.633 --> 15:20.100
WHAT ARE WE PUTTING THE MONEY
IN THAT BASKET FOR?

15:24.800 --> 15:25.800
OH.

15:25.800 --> 15:27.233
AH, IT'S HIS MACHINE.

15:27.233 --> 15:30.000
HEY, FATHER HUBLEY,
HI, IT'S RAYMOND BARONE.

15:30.000 --> 15:31.433
- ASK HIM ABOUT SPACE.

15:31.433 --> 15:32.833
WHAT'S AT THE END?
WHAT'S OUT THERE?

15:32.833 --> 15:34.667
- WILL YOU STOP IT?
- WHAT'S OUT THERE?

15:34.667 --> 15:35.933
- ANYWAY,

15:35.933 --> 15:38.133
ME AND THE FAMILY
WERE JUST SITTIN' AROUND,

15:38.133 --> 15:40.900
AND WE HAD
A QUICK QUESTION FOR YOU.

15:40.900 --> 15:43.000
WHAT IS THE MEANING OF LIFE?

15:44.933 --> 15:47.267
SO IF YOU COULD GET BACK TO US
AS SOON AS POSSIBLE,

15:47.267 --> 15:49.467
WE'D APPRECIATE IT,
ALL RIGHT?

15:49.467 --> 15:51.367
WE'RE KIND OF WAITING.

15:51.367 --> 15:52.967
OKAY.
THANK YOU.

15:52.967 --> 15:53.967
GOOD-BYE.

15:53.967 --> 15:55.800
GOD BLESS YOU.

15:55.800 --> 15:57.600
AND US.

15:57.600 --> 16:00.800
AND THE MEEK.

16:00.800 --> 16:02.767
- HERE IT IS. HERE IT IS.

16:02.767 --> 16:07.200
"WHERE THERE ARE NO OXEN,
THE CRIB REMAINS EMPTY,

16:07.200 --> 16:08.967
"BUT LARGE CROPS COME

16:08.967 --> 16:11.467
THROUGH THE STRENGTH
OF THE BULL."

16:15.667 --> 16:18.367
- THAT'S GOT NOTHING
TO DO WITH THIS.

16:18.367 --> 16:20.133
- NO?

16:21.533 --> 16:23.767
- NO!

16:23.767 --> 16:25.600
- OKAY.

16:29.500 --> 16:35.433
- DO YOU KNOW THE FRUIT FLY
ONLY LIVES ONE DAY?

16:35.433 --> 16:37.733
- HUH? WHAT?
ARE YOU OKAY THERE?

16:37.733 --> 16:40.700
- ONE DAY.

16:40.700 --> 16:43.500
WHAT'S HIS
MEANING OF LIFE, HUH?

16:43.500 --> 16:46.533
MAYBE THERE'S NO MEANING OF LIFE
FOR ANY ONE OF US.

16:46.533 --> 16:48.033
I MEAN, REALLY,

16:48.033 --> 16:52.400
AM I ANY DIFFERENT
THAN THE FRUIT FLY?

16:52.400 --> 16:56.100
- THE FRUIT PART'S THE SAME.

16:59.333 --> 17:01.167
- ROBERT, THE FRUIT FLY DOESN'T
QUESTION WHY HE'S HERE.

17:01.167 --> 17:02.900
THAT'S WHAT
MAKES US DIFFERENT.

17:02.900 --> 17:05.033
I DON'T KNOW, MAYBE THAT'S
KIND OF THE MEANING OF LIFE:

17:05.033 --> 17:07.900
NEVER KNOWING THE ANSWER,
BUT ALWAYS WONDERING ABOUT IT.

17:07.900 --> 17:11.067
- SO GOD MADE US SMART ENOUGH
TO KNOW THAT THERE'S AN ANSWER,

17:11.067 --> 17:13.800
BUT NOT SMART ENOUGH
TO FIGURE IT OUT?

17:13.800 --> 17:16.533
- COME ON!

17:26.700 --> 17:28.667
- ALL RIGHT, LOOK,
WHAT AM I GOING TO TELL ALLY?

17:28.667 --> 17:29.500
SHE'S WAITING NOW.

17:29.500 --> 17:30.833
- TELL HER TO COME DOWN HERE.

17:30.833 --> 17:32.000
I'LL SET HER STRAIGHT.

17:32.000 --> 17:33.500
NO MORE OF THIS NONSENSE.

17:33.500 --> 17:35.367
- IT'S NOT NONSENSE, FRANK!

17:35.367 --> 17:37.267
HAVEN'T YOU EVER HEARD
THAT THE UNEXAMINED LIFE

17:37.267 --> 17:38.800
IS NOT WORTH LIVING?

17:38.800 --> 17:40.633
- HEY, YOU KNOW WHAT?

17:40.633 --> 17:42.700
[feigns snoring]

17:44.167 --> 17:46.167
- THAT'S YOUR PROBLEM, FRANK.

17:46.167 --> 17:47.600
YOU'RE SO CLOSED-MINDED.

17:47.600 --> 17:51.200
- NO, THE PROBLEM IS,
YOU'RE SO OPEN-MOUTHED.

17:51.200 --> 17:52.833
- NO, SHE'S RIGHT, FRANK.

17:52.833 --> 17:55.300
MAYBE IF YOU LET YOURSELF
BE A LITTLE MORE OPEN-MINDED

17:55.300 --> 17:56.600
AND LET YOURSELF THINK
ABOUT SOME OF THESE THINGS,

17:56.600 --> 17:58.533
LIFE MIGHT BE BETTER
FOR ALL OF US.

17:58.533 --> 18:00.367
- OKAY, GREAT, YOU'VE GOT
ANSWERS FOR EVERYBODY

18:00.367 --> 18:01.367
EXCEPT YOUR OWN DAUGHTER.

18:01.367 --> 18:02.767
- WHAT?
- YOU HEARD HIM.

18:02.767 --> 18:04.733
IT'S ME AND HIM
AGAINST ALL THREE OF YOU.

18:04.733 --> 18:07.067
- NO, IT'S NOT, DAD.

18:11.767 --> 18:14.500
I'M JUST SAYING
WE SHOULD BE FOCUSING

18:14.500 --> 18:15.800
ON WHAT TO TELL ALLY RIGHT NOW.

18:15.800 --> 18:17.267
- OH, WE.

18:17.267 --> 18:19.800
YEAH, WE, BECAUSE
WE SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS

18:19.800 --> 18:20.900
AROUND THIS HOUSE, RIGHT?

18:20.900 --> 18:22.367
LET'S FACE IT, RAY.

18:22.367 --> 18:25.567
WHEN YOU SAY "WE," YOU MEAN ME,
THE "SMELLY TRAMP."

18:34.767 --> 18:37.233
- WHAT?

18:37.233 --> 18:38.800
- SMELLY TRAMP.

18:38.800 --> 18:41.400
THAT'S THE NICKNAME
YOUR SON CAME UP WITH FOR ME.

18:41.400 --> 18:43.733
- I DIDN'T SAY THAT
AND YOU KNOW IT.

18:43.733 --> 18:47.733
IT'S "THMELLY TRAMP"!

18:47.733 --> 18:50.500
- OH, WELL, THAT'S CUTE.

18:51.867 --> 18:54.400
- HEY, MARIE, WHILE YOU'RE
HOLDING THAT BIBLE,

18:54.400 --> 18:56.233
I'VE GOT A QUESTION FOR YOU.

18:56.233 --> 18:58.700
DID YOU EAT
THE TWO MISSING CANNOLIS?

19:00.367 --> 19:03.467
- FRANK, I'M NOT GONNA LET YOU
USE THE BIBLE LIKE THAT.

19:03.467 --> 19:05.200
- ANSWER ME,
YES OR NO?

19:05.200 --> 19:07.033
- THIS IS RIDICULOUS!

19:07.033 --> 19:10.933
NO, I DIDN'T EAT
THOSE TWO CANNOLIS.

19:10.933 --> 19:12.867
- DID YOU SEE WHAT SHE DID?

19:12.867 --> 19:14.367
PICK IT UP!

19:14.367 --> 19:16.500
PICK IT UP AND TELL US
WHAT HAPPENED TO THOSE CANNOLIS!

19:16.500 --> 19:17.400
- OH, SHUT UP!

19:17.400 --> 19:21.200
- THOU SHALT NOT
EAT THE CANNOLI!

19:21.200 --> 19:23.000
- NEVER MIND THE CANNOLIS, MA!

19:23.000 --> 19:25.467
TAKE THIS BIBLE AND TELL ME
THAT YOU DON'T SPEND MORE MONEY

19:25.467 --> 19:28.767
ON RAYMOND'S CHRISTMAS GIFTS
THAN MINE!

19:28.767 --> 19:30.833
- THAT'S RIDICULOUS!

19:30.833 --> 19:31.900
- FIFTH GRADE.

19:31.900 --> 19:34.433
BIKE, SLIPPERS.
TELL THE TRUTH!

19:34.433 --> 19:37.067
- THOSE SLIPPERS
WERE VERY EXPENSIVE, ROBBIE!

19:37.067 --> 19:39.767
- TAKE THE BOOK!

19:39.767 --> 19:41.367
- ALL RIGHT!

19:41.367 --> 19:44.267
ALL RIGHT, THANK YOU FOR
ALL THE ENLIGHTENMENT!

19:44.267 --> 19:45.900
- WAIT A MINUTE,
WHAT ARE YOU GONNA TELL ALLY?

19:45.900 --> 19:48.033
- I DON'T KNOW, BUT THE ANSWER
CAN'T BE DOWN HERE!

19:48.033 --> 19:50.200
- WELL, NEITHER CAN I!

19:52.067 --> 19:53.900
- LOOK, I DON'T KNOW WHAT
I'M GONNA SAY EXACTLY,

19:53.900 --> 19:55.333
BUT HELP ME, ALL RIGHT?

19:55.333 --> 19:56.833
DON'T JUST STAND THERE
AND MAKE YOUR FACES.

19:56.833 --> 19:59.800
- CAN WE JUST DO THIS?
SHE'S WAITING.

19:59.800 --> 20:02.200
- AH, AH, AH, AH!

20:02.200 --> 20:04.367
LEAVE THAT FACE
IN THE HALL.

20:06.133 --> 20:07.133
[knocks on door]

20:07.133 --> 20:08.767
ALLY.

20:08.767 --> 20:10.333
HEY, SHE'S NOT IN HERE.

20:10.333 --> 20:12.100
- WHAT?

20:12.100 --> 20:15.233
[children laughing
and playing]

20:17.767 --> 20:18.867
- ALLY.

20:18.867 --> 20:20.233
[Ally laughing]

20:20.233 --> 20:22.867
ALLY.
- WHAT?

20:22.867 --> 20:26.000
- LISTEN, WE WANTED TO TALK TO
YOU ABOUT YOUR QUESTION, OKAY?

20:26.000 --> 20:28.667
- WHAT QUESTION?

20:28.667 --> 20:30.300
- ALLY, HONEY, COME ON.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.900
- [laughing]
GET OFF ME.

20:33.900 --> 20:37.033
[children laughing
and playing]

20:50.467 --> 20:53.133
- [laughing]
GET OFF ME!

20:57.033 --> 20:58.267
[glass shattering]

20:58.267 --> 21:01.000
- HEY, GUYS!
- WHAT ARE YOU DOING?
