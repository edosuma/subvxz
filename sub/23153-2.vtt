WEBVTT

00:05.006 --> 00:07.633
<i>Jo!</i>

00:07.800 --> 00:09.385
<i>Jo!</i>

00:11.178 --> 00:12.930
Jo, have you got
the curling papers?

00:13.097 --> 00:14.056
Ugh!

00:14.223 --> 00:15.474
There was a whole box

00:15.641 --> 00:17.059
full in the dresser
on the landing!

00:17.226 --> 00:20.062
Marmee left them
and said we were to share them.

00:20.229 --> 00:21.480
Amy, what use
do you suppose I have

00:21.647 --> 00:23.149
for curling papers?

00:23.315 --> 00:25.526
Sorry.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.486
I forgot.

00:31.782 --> 00:33.576
<i>Beth? Beth!</i>

00:33.743 --> 00:35.745
<i>"Marmee, I wish
you could see how well</i>

00:35.911 --> 00:38.080
<i>"your troop of 'little women'
have marshalled themselves.</i>

00:38.247 --> 00:39.415
<i>"It would do Father more good</i>

00:39.582 --> 00:41.625
<i>"than all the medicine
in Washington.</i>

00:44.253 --> 00:45.838
<i>"Mr. Brooke was a hero
to telegraph</i>

00:46.005 --> 00:47.131
<i>"as soon as your arrived.</i>

00:47.298 --> 00:50.176
<i>"Just to know that
the news was not the worst</i>

00:50.342 --> 00:53.054
<i>"was enough to send us wild
with happiness</i>

00:53.220 --> 00:55.598
<i>and back to our posts
in the house like soldiers."</i>

00:55.765 --> 00:58.350
Beth? Beth!

00:58.517 --> 01:00.227
Have you seen
the curling papers?

01:00.394 --> 01:02.313
Marmee said I was
to start doing my own hair.

01:02.480 --> 01:03.689
No, and Marmee also said

01:03.856 --> 01:05.191
you shouldn't put papers in
on weekdays.

01:05.357 --> 01:07.401
Marmee isn't here.

01:13.574 --> 01:17.536
<i>"You wouldn't find a single
fault in us, I promise."</i>

01:48.984 --> 01:50.736
Curling papers!

01:50.903 --> 01:53.405
I knew someone
had taken them!

01:53.572 --> 01:55.241
Where are you going?

01:55.407 --> 01:56.534
On Thursday, I'm going to stay

01:56.700 --> 01:58.285
at Annie Moffat's.

01:58.452 --> 01:59.620
You didn't say!

01:59.787 --> 02:02.748
I only just got permission
from Mr. Laurence.

02:02.915 --> 02:05.000
Marmee entrusted him
with all such matters.

02:05.167 --> 02:07.128
Marmee also told us all to be
indigent about our work.

02:07.294 --> 02:08.629
How can you be indigent

02:08.796 --> 02:10.089
when you abandon
your poor pupils

02:10.256 --> 02:12.591
to go gallivanting off
at somebody's mansion?

02:12.758 --> 02:14.510
The word is diligent,
not indigent.

02:14.677 --> 02:16.220
And my poor pupils
are going to the ocean

02:16.387 --> 02:17.596
with their parents,

02:17.763 --> 02:20.558
because there's
scarlet fever in town.

02:22.977 --> 02:24.895
There's going to be a ball.

02:25.062 --> 02:27.273
Annie's sister Belle
just got engaged!

02:27.439 --> 02:28.691
A ball
at the Moffats'?

02:28.858 --> 02:31.026
It's all going to be
so elegant!

02:31.193 --> 02:32.653
Would you like to be engaged?

02:32.820 --> 02:35.239
Oh, I'd like
to be married one day.

02:35.406 --> 02:37.867
Well, you won't
catch many husbands

02:38.033 --> 02:39.535
in this shabby
old tarlatan.

02:39.702 --> 02:41.078
Marmee always said
the first one of us

02:41.245 --> 02:43.539
to get to go to a ball would
wear that violet silk dress.

02:43.706 --> 02:45.875
The one she keeps wrapped up
in the special paper.

02:46.041 --> 02:48.294
There isn't time
to make it over.

02:48.460 --> 02:51.172
This shabby old tarlatan
will have to do.

02:51.338 --> 02:53.966
Hmm.

02:54.133 --> 02:56.135
Well, you might
ruin it anyway.

02:56.302 --> 02:57.678
Like when you turned the sleeves
on my old dress,

02:57.845 --> 03:00.347
and they came out bluer
than the bodice.

03:00.514 --> 03:02.141
Oh, I was a figure of fun

03:02.308 --> 03:04.059
at school for days.

03:04.226 --> 03:07.438
And it's bad enough that I owe
at least a dozen pickled limes.

03:07.605 --> 03:08.731
Pickled lime's
still the fashion?

03:08.898 --> 03:12.318
Yes, even though Mr. Davis
has forbidden them.

03:12.484 --> 03:13.819
And I am dreadfully
in debt,

03:13.986 --> 03:16.697
because I can't return them.

03:16.864 --> 03:19.491
You know what it's like to be
socially disadvantaged.

03:22.536 --> 03:23.996
Will twenty five cents
buy enough pickled limes

03:24.163 --> 03:25.414
to restore your dignity?

03:33.297 --> 03:35.466
Mrs. March?

03:37.426 --> 03:39.094
I asked the landlady
of the boarding house

03:39.261 --> 03:41.055
to make up a jug of beef tea.

03:41.222 --> 03:44.600
She packed it up with some
toast, and a little fruit.

03:44.767 --> 03:47.811
Mr. March isn't able
to eat anything...

03:47.978 --> 03:49.813
But you are.

03:49.980 --> 03:51.857
And you must.

04:11.961 --> 04:13.629
Good morning, Mary.

04:13.796 --> 04:15.464
I came in early this morning
for extra algebra.

04:15.631 --> 04:17.216
Oh, pickled limes.

04:17.383 --> 04:19.009
You're brave.

04:19.176 --> 04:20.427
Mr. Davis took his coffee

04:20.594 --> 04:22.221
way too strong
this morning.

04:22.388 --> 04:23.555
He's as nervous
as a witch

04:23.722 --> 04:26.058
and as cross
as a bear.

04:26.225 --> 04:27.559
Amy March has pickled limes.

04:27.726 --> 04:29.061
I might have known
you'd smell them

04:29.228 --> 04:30.437
from across the yard.

04:30.604 --> 04:32.022
You could always smell mine.

04:32.189 --> 04:33.482
Flat nose or no flat nose.

04:36.402 --> 04:38.237
I wanted to wear white tonight,

04:38.404 --> 04:40.948
but Mother said that was
for debutantes and brides--

04:41.115 --> 04:43.826
I've been a debutante already,

04:43.993 --> 04:46.120
and we're already planning
my wedding gown.

04:46.287 --> 04:48.497
Oh these flowers you've brought
from the Laurences',

04:48.664 --> 04:49.540
they're delicious, Meg!

04:49.707 --> 04:51.250
The young man of the house

04:51.417 --> 04:53.210
is clearly out to spoil you.

04:53.377 --> 04:54.753
Sallie,
I think you'll find

04:54.920 --> 04:57.631
it was the old man
of the house.

04:57.798 --> 05:00.175
Mr. Laurence knows
I like to share.

05:00.342 --> 05:01.635
And that is just one

05:01.802 --> 05:04.638
of the many very
delightful things about you.

05:04.805 --> 05:06.265
And although we all think
that there really

05:06.432 --> 05:07.683
couldn't be a much prettier
version of you...

05:07.850 --> 05:10.978
You have the loveliest arms
of all us,

05:11.145 --> 05:13.480
and almost
the smallest waist.

05:13.647 --> 05:14.857
I only have
that half-inch less

05:15.024 --> 05:16.650
because of my new corset.

05:16.817 --> 05:18.819
You would look so adorable
in a brand-new gown,

05:18.986 --> 05:20.571
with French heels
to match it,

05:20.738 --> 05:23.324
and maybe one of these flowers
in a little silver holder.

05:23.490 --> 05:27.619
But I don't have
any of those things.

05:27.786 --> 05:29.747
And I can't complain
or apologize,

05:29.913 --> 05:33.250
because that's
just the way things are.

05:33.417 --> 05:36.920
Well, not necessarily.

05:39.214 --> 05:40.716
<i>Did you see Meg's face</i>

05:40.883 --> 05:42.801
<i>when we left her
at the Moffats'?</i>

05:46.764 --> 05:48.057
It's odd knowing your sister's
at somebody else's house

05:48.223 --> 05:50.184
surrounded by things
she'd love to have,

05:50.351 --> 05:51.268
but can't afford
to buy.

05:51.435 --> 05:53.562
Can't afford to buy now.

05:53.729 --> 05:55.773
She may marry a man
who'll make her very happy.

05:55.939 --> 05:58.275
Ned Moffat
and the Gardiner boys

05:58.442 --> 05:59.902
are going to that ball.

06:00.069 --> 06:01.362
That isn't funny,
Teddy.

06:01.528 --> 06:03.238
I've felt so rumpled
in my mind

06:03.405 --> 06:05.407
ever since you told me that
Brooke had taken Meg's glove.

06:05.574 --> 06:07.409
And kept it
in his pocket.

06:07.576 --> 06:08.827
Ned Moffat
and the Gardiner boys

06:08.994 --> 06:10.204
aren't all bad.

06:10.371 --> 06:12.247
They just like
a harmless lark

06:12.414 --> 06:13.707
now and then.

06:13.874 --> 06:15.209
And so do I.

06:15.376 --> 06:17.503
Going to town
and playing billiards

06:17.669 --> 06:19.671
and drinking whiskey
aren't harmless.

06:19.838 --> 06:21.465
Because if you run wild,
Marmee will put a stop

06:21.632 --> 06:22.758
to all of
our good times.

06:22.925 --> 06:24.051
I see.

06:24.218 --> 06:25.344
In which case I'd better be

06:25.511 --> 06:26.553
a double-distilled saint.

06:26.720 --> 06:27.930
Why can't you
just be grateful

06:28.097 --> 06:29.890
for all the chances
that you have?

06:30.057 --> 06:32.351
The chance to study,
the chance to go to college,

06:32.518 --> 06:34.228
The chance to spend
years of your life

06:34.395 --> 06:36.563
with books and ideas.

06:36.730 --> 06:37.940
You say it as though
I might enjoy it.

06:38.107 --> 06:39.400
I'd enjoy it.

06:39.566 --> 06:42.694
Are you going to deliver
lectures all the way home?

06:42.861 --> 06:44.696
Because if you are,

06:44.863 --> 06:46.365
I'm going to walk someplace
where I can take a bus.

06:46.532 --> 06:47.825
I just worry
about you, Laurie,

06:47.991 --> 06:49.118
because you've got
such a strong will

06:49.284 --> 06:50.411
that if you ever
go the wrong way,

06:50.577 --> 06:51.870
it won't be possible
to stop you.

06:53.414 --> 06:54.706
Whilst you, of course,

06:54.873 --> 06:56.333
are always entirely
open to reason

06:56.500 --> 06:59.628
and never afraid
to admit you're in the wrong.

06:59.795 --> 07:01.296
I meant what I said.

07:01.463 --> 07:02.881
I'll take the bus.

07:03.048 --> 07:05.134
No,
I'll take the bus.

07:58.312 --> 08:00.189
Young ladies,
my eye is upon you.

08:00.355 --> 08:01.982
If you will
be good enough

08:02.149 --> 08:05.486
to return your attention
to the front of the class,

08:05.652 --> 08:08.030
I'd like you all
to direct your attention

08:08.197 --> 08:10.782
to this map
of the Dutch East Indies.

08:12.701 --> 08:14.661
Miss Kingsley, what is the
object of your interest?

08:14.828 --> 08:16.705
The map of
the Dutch East Indies, sir.

08:20.250 --> 08:22.002
I think the object
of her interest

08:22.169 --> 08:24.087
is the parcel
in Miss March's desk.

08:26.840 --> 08:28.509
And would Miss March
like to enlighten us

08:28.675 --> 08:32.387
as to the contents
of that parcel?

08:32.554 --> 08:33.722
No, sir.

08:33.889 --> 08:35.891
I would not.

08:43.357 --> 08:44.691
Pickled limes.

08:47.444 --> 08:48.570
Yes.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.155
Pick them up.

09:03.544 --> 09:05.003
Out the window.

09:06.255 --> 09:07.464
What?

09:07.631 --> 09:10.259
Out the window, now!
Two at a time!

09:52.551 --> 09:56.221
And you'll remain there
until recess.

10:03.979 --> 10:06.023
I'm never going back there.

10:06.189 --> 10:07.316
And I'm not going
to make you.

10:07.482 --> 10:09.234
If I had my way,

10:09.401 --> 10:11.069
that vicious animal
would be arrested.

10:11.236 --> 10:13.739
Jail would be
too good for him.

10:13.905 --> 10:14.906
He made me throw two dozen

10:15.073 --> 10:16.325
perfectly good limes
out the window.

10:16.491 --> 10:18.785
That's not why
he should be punished, Amy.

10:18.952 --> 10:20.329
And if he had to punish you,

10:20.495 --> 10:22.706
he shouldn't have done it
this way!

10:22.873 --> 10:26.752
All I could think about
was Marmee's face.

10:26.918 --> 10:30.714
And how disappointed she would
be when she finds out.

10:30.881 --> 10:32.049
Beth.

10:32.215 --> 10:34.051
Would you please go
and play some piano?

10:35.510 --> 10:37.262
Music might set us
back to rights.

10:49.232 --> 10:50.692
Why in the name
of Christopher Columbus

10:50.859 --> 10:52.152
are you playing
"Land of the Leal," Beth?

10:52.319 --> 10:54.988
Because it's Father
and Marmee's favorite!

11:14.091 --> 11:15.300
May I take you into supper,
Miss March?

11:15.467 --> 11:18.512
Oh, <i>quelle dommage.</i>

11:18.679 --> 11:21.890
I already have someone
on my card for that.

11:22.057 --> 11:24.142
I thought so--
Reuben Gardiner.

11:24.309 --> 11:25.936
I'm not
so easily rebuffed,

11:26.103 --> 11:27.396
you bewitching
little minx.

11:27.562 --> 11:29.773
May I put my name down

11:29.940 --> 11:31.733
for Lancers?

11:31.900 --> 11:33.694
If you are very,
very good,

11:33.860 --> 11:36.613
I might just accept you
for the Quadrille.

11:36.780 --> 11:38.657
It really is
the last one left.

11:45.080 --> 11:46.707
I-I'm going
to be very naughty

11:46.873 --> 11:48.583
and ask you
to excuse me.

11:48.750 --> 11:50.544
A family friend
has just arrived

11:50.711 --> 11:52.045
and will expect
my company.

11:52.212 --> 11:53.964
I don't care
to disappoint him.

11:56.049 --> 11:57.217
Oh.

11:58.969 --> 12:00.387
That family friend.

12:00.554 --> 12:03.682
So it's true,
what everyone says then.

12:03.849 --> 12:05.767
Everyone?

12:05.934 --> 12:07.644
Including my mother.

12:07.811 --> 12:10.772
"Mrs. March has made
her plans," she said.

12:14.735 --> 12:16.194
Made what plans?

12:29.207 --> 12:32.836
Stop fanning yourself,
it isn't even hot.

12:33.003 --> 12:35.338
I brought you a glass of
champagne and an ice cream.

12:35.505 --> 12:37.090
I've had
so much champagne

12:37.257 --> 12:38.717
I've already started the
headache I'll wake up with

12:38.884 --> 12:41.261
in the morning.

12:41.428 --> 12:45.974
How dare people even think
that Marmee "has plans"?

12:46.141 --> 12:48.560
That she's plotting for us
to make a match?

12:48.727 --> 12:50.353
She's not
that sort of woman.

12:50.520 --> 12:52.355
And I'll make my own match,
thank you very much.

12:52.522 --> 12:56.151
I daresay I will,
one day.

12:56.318 --> 12:59.404
But I'm certainly not going
to plan, and scheme,

12:59.571 --> 13:02.032
and have Marmee's integrity
called into question.

13:02.199 --> 13:04.701
Meg, why don't you just
eat your ice cream?

13:04.868 --> 13:08.747
Because my feet burn so
in these borrowed shoes,

13:08.914 --> 13:13.335
that I would rather
just stick them right in it.

13:13.502 --> 13:15.295
Oh.

13:15.462 --> 13:17.964
Don't tell Jo
I let them dress me up.

13:20.050 --> 13:22.552
She doesn't like
anything to do with romance

13:22.719 --> 13:26.097
or flirting.

13:26.264 --> 13:29.059
I know.

13:29.226 --> 13:30.519
She might change her mind.

13:36.900 --> 13:39.653
Mmm.

13:48.662 --> 13:50.038
Are you coming in
with me?

13:55.710 --> 13:58.129
Oh!

14:06.555 --> 14:08.932
I hereby serve notice
of the withdrawal of my sister

14:09.099 --> 14:10.350
from your school.

14:13.395 --> 14:16.356
Fees until the end of this week
are enclosed.

14:16.523 --> 14:20.277
Miss March was rather
a favorite of mine.

14:20.443 --> 14:22.529
Had she once apologized,

14:22.696 --> 14:26.449
or beseeched, or begged me,
I would have desisted.

14:26.616 --> 14:28.952
She should have
apologized.

14:29.119 --> 14:31.121
But if she was too proud to
beseech, or beg, I commend her.

14:48.430 --> 14:52.851
It says here that the Union Army
lost heavily at Ball's Bluff.

14:53.018 --> 14:54.561
They advanced into four
Confederate regiments,

14:54.728 --> 14:57.355
and in the confusion, many men
tried to swim the river

14:57.522 --> 14:58.857
and drowned.

14:59.024 --> 15:00.108
It's definitely setting.

15:00.275 --> 15:01.151
I'm glad I put
less water in

15:01.318 --> 15:03.904
than the
instructions said.

15:04.070 --> 15:06.573
I hope they don't
introduce conscription.

15:06.740 --> 15:08.074
Marmee needs Mr. Brooke
to stay in Washington,

15:08.241 --> 15:10.577
and I wouldn't
want him called away.

15:10.744 --> 15:12.037
I can send them
an artistic model of my foot

15:12.203 --> 15:14.164
when I've completed
this casting.

15:14.331 --> 15:17.292
They can put it where Father
can see it from his bed.

15:19.711 --> 15:21.254
Hannah, may I take this loaf
to the Hummels'?

15:21.421 --> 15:22.714
You can take it if
you've a wish to

15:22.881 --> 15:24.215
and no desire
for any bread yourself.

15:24.382 --> 15:26.468
It's the last morsel
we have,

15:26.635 --> 15:28.637
and seeing as it's a wash day,
there'll be no more

15:28.803 --> 15:30.847
till one of your sisters
rolls up her sleeves

15:31.014 --> 15:33.808
and sets to it with the yeast
and the proving pans.

15:33.975 --> 15:35.352
I've enough to do

15:35.518 --> 15:37.020
with that cat
having kittens again,

15:37.187 --> 15:40.190
in the necessary house.

15:45.278 --> 15:46.404
It won't come out!

15:48.114 --> 15:49.783
It won't come out!

15:49.950 --> 15:51.368
It won't come out!

15:51.534 --> 15:53.161
Shouldn't you have greased
your foot first?

15:53.328 --> 15:54.496
I don't know.

15:54.663 --> 15:59.501
We need a mallet.

16:06.925 --> 16:08.718
Will one of you come
with me to the Hummels'?

16:08.885 --> 16:10.762
Oh I have letters
to write,

16:10.929 --> 16:12.847
including one
to Marmee.

16:13.014 --> 16:15.183
And can't you see
I am being incommoded by my art?

16:18.687 --> 16:20.522
You've been to the Hummels'
every day this week, Beth.

16:20.689 --> 16:21.773
Mrs. Hummel has

16:21.940 --> 16:23.274
some scrubbing work,

16:23.441 --> 16:25.026
but she's leaving Lottchen in
charge of all the little ones.

16:25.193 --> 16:26.945
I have a cold, Beth.

16:27.112 --> 16:28.363
I'd be at Aunt March's,

16:28.530 --> 16:29.739
but she can't stand
to hear me read

16:29.906 --> 16:31.491
when my nose is blocked.

16:56.182 --> 16:59.394
Lottchen.

16:59.561 --> 17:00.687
Where's the baby?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.481
Lottchen?

17:06.026 --> 17:09.612
Lottchen,
where's the baby?

17:09.779 --> 17:11.990
Mommy!

17:12.157 --> 17:13.950
Oh, please wake up, baby.

17:16.953 --> 17:18.705
I brought bread with me,

17:18.872 --> 17:21.499
and milk.

17:21.666 --> 17:24.252
I'm going to make you all sorts
of good things to eat.

17:24.419 --> 17:25.837
Please wake up, baby.

17:26.004 --> 17:28.590
Please wake up.

17:28.757 --> 17:29.883
Please wake up.

17:30.050 --> 17:32.177
Mommy!

17:32.343 --> 17:33.970
Please wake up.

17:54.282 --> 17:56.826
I need to see
Doctor Bangs.

17:56.993 --> 18:00.580
How long have
the family been ill?

18:00.747 --> 18:03.583
A little bit sick
for a week or so.

18:03.750 --> 18:06.586
I only saw the rash
on them today.

18:06.753 --> 18:08.129
His mother has
gone out scrubbing,

18:08.296 --> 18:09.923
so she can pay you.

18:15.637 --> 18:17.305
There will be no bill.

18:20.391 --> 18:22.310
And now
I need to examine you.

18:32.654 --> 18:34.739
Beth?

18:40.495 --> 18:42.122
Is the doctor absolutely sure
it's scarlet fever?

18:42.288 --> 18:44.457
He's seen a dozen children die
in the past two weeks.

18:44.624 --> 18:46.084
I would have noticed

18:46.251 --> 18:47.377
if I hadn't been
so obsessed

18:47.544 --> 18:48.628
with scribbling
all that rubbish!

18:48.795 --> 18:50.046
I knew there was an epidemic
in town.

18:50.213 --> 18:51.673
I should have made her
stay at home.

18:53.800 --> 18:56.302
Dried lavender.

18:56.469 --> 18:58.763
Marmee must have put it there.

18:58.930 --> 19:01.766
You have to telegraph her.

19:01.933 --> 19:04.144
She has to come home
from Washington.

19:06.104 --> 19:07.188
You can't manage this alone.

19:07.355 --> 19:10.984
Father might be dying,
Laurie.

19:11.151 --> 19:12.652
Marmee can't leave him.

19:16.739 --> 19:19.784
We have to spare her
what anxiety we can.

19:22.954 --> 19:24.247
I'm not going!

19:24.414 --> 19:26.082
I tell you, I'm not going!

19:26.249 --> 19:28.168
I already told Meg,
and I told Jo.

19:28.334 --> 19:30.253
They still think
the change of air

19:30.420 --> 19:32.005
will stop you
getting scarlet fever.

19:32.172 --> 19:34.007
I'd rather get scarlet fever

19:34.174 --> 19:36.217
than go to stay
at Aunt March's house.

19:36.384 --> 19:38.386
Scarlet fever
isn't a joke, Amy.

19:38.553 --> 19:40.180
Neither is spending weeks
on end

19:40.346 --> 19:42.765
in a dull house
with a cross old woman,

19:42.932 --> 19:45.143
a poodle, and a parrot.

19:49.731 --> 19:52.358
How about I come
and visit you

19:52.525 --> 19:54.903
at Aunt March's
every day

19:55.069 --> 19:57.780
and take you out
for a drive?

20:02.535 --> 20:04.329
In the carriage or the Phaeton?

20:04.495 --> 20:07.582
The carriage and the Phaeton
on alternate afternoons,

20:07.749 --> 20:10.627
if you'll only go tell Meg and
Jo you've changed your mind.

20:20.720 --> 20:22.847
Very well.

20:23.014 --> 20:25.516
As long as everyone remembers
I'm making a great sacrifice.

20:33.149 --> 20:35.026
I brought
the hot water bottle.

20:38.071 --> 20:41.282
Oh, I thought
I'd be warmer by now.

20:41.449 --> 20:43.326
It's a long time
since I came in

20:43.493 --> 20:45.912
out of the rain.

20:54.087 --> 20:56.130
Scarlet fever?

20:56.297 --> 20:57.924
Huh, it's inevitable,

20:58.091 --> 20:59.550
if you're all encouraged

20:59.717 --> 21:01.386
to go poking about
among poor folks.

21:01.552 --> 21:03.972
Are you expected to succumb?

21:04.138 --> 21:05.974
They sent me here
in the hope that I wouldn't.

21:07.392 --> 21:08.685
Don't sniff.

21:08.851 --> 21:10.937
I can't abide it
when people sniff.

21:12.730 --> 21:15.233
Do they pet you at home
and make much of you?

21:15.400 --> 21:19.070
Are you lavished
with affection and kind words?

21:19.237 --> 21:20.446
Yes.

21:20.613 --> 21:23.366
The female animal
should not be indulged,

21:23.533 --> 21:25.702
for hers is a thorny path.

21:25.868 --> 21:29.080
She must learn to tread it
in a spirit of self-governance.

21:29.247 --> 21:31.332
Yes, Aunt March.

21:31.499 --> 21:34.711
Your countenance
is not unpleasant,

21:34.877 --> 21:38.089
and I dare to hope
you may prove less intractable

21:38.256 --> 21:39.882
and more rewarding

21:40.049 --> 21:41.801
than your sister.

21:43.678 --> 21:45.888
May I put the parrot down now,
Aunt March?

21:46.055 --> 21:47.765
Oh, if you so desire.

21:47.932 --> 21:50.518
But if he suspects
that you not admire him,

21:50.685 --> 21:53.354
he will devise
a method of revenge.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.531
Can I see her?

22:03.698 --> 22:05.116
She wouldn't know you,
sir.

22:05.283 --> 22:06.409
And the doctor bade us

22:06.576 --> 22:08.953
keep her quiet,
with the curtains drawn,

22:09.120 --> 22:10.455
lest the fever
settle on her eyes.

22:10.621 --> 22:13.207
And blind her?

22:13.374 --> 22:16.544
Mr. March has suffered

22:16.711 --> 22:19.756
a relapse of his encephalitis.

22:19.922 --> 22:22.383
So it's not pneumonia,
then?

22:22.550 --> 22:25.553
No, it never was.

22:25.720 --> 22:27.638
He has a fever
of the brain.

22:30.850 --> 22:33.144
I'm not partial to falsehoods,

22:33.311 --> 22:34.812
but I daresay
there are times

22:34.979 --> 22:37.940
when they're more honorable
than the truth.

22:39.359 --> 22:40.485
Green birds.

22:40.651 --> 22:41.986
No.

22:42.153 --> 22:43.488
There are no
green birds.

22:46.366 --> 22:48.951
It's just the pattern
of the ivy on the wallpaper.

22:49.118 --> 22:50.953
You're safe here in bed.

22:51.120 --> 22:52.872
They're moving.

22:53.039 --> 22:55.583
They're not moving,
I promise you.

22:57.502 --> 22:59.879
You have to come back,
Beth.

23:00.046 --> 23:02.673
Too many people
miss you.

23:07.011 --> 23:11.349
I miss you.

23:57.228 --> 23:59.647
Estelle lets me come in here
when Aunt March is napping.

24:04.777 --> 24:06.737
The string of pearls Aunt
March's father gave her,

24:06.904 --> 24:09.073
when she turned 18.

24:09.240 --> 24:10.867
Estelle says

24:11.033 --> 24:13.202
the first one of us to be
engaged will get it.

24:15.246 --> 24:16.747
And look,

24:16.914 --> 24:18.416
it's the silver bracelet

24:18.583 --> 24:20.585
the only baby
she ever had wore.

24:20.751 --> 24:22.378
Until it died.

24:24.005 --> 24:25.256
Look!

24:25.423 --> 24:27.717
Her wedding ring.

24:27.884 --> 24:30.178
She's too fat to wear it now.

24:32.054 --> 24:33.431
Oh!

24:33.598 --> 24:35.224
I am a venerable butterfingers.

24:41.063 --> 24:43.191
Thank you.

24:43.357 --> 24:45.401
Laurie.

24:45.568 --> 24:49.238
I want you to witness my will.

24:52.742 --> 24:54.243
"I, Amy Curtis March,

24:54.410 --> 24:57.622
"do give and bequeath
all my earthly things, viz.,

24:57.788 --> 24:59.457
"and to wit.

24:59.624 --> 25:01.292
"Namely, to Jo,

25:01.459 --> 25:03.044
"my most precious
plaster rabbit,

25:03.211 --> 25:05.046
"because I'm sorry
I burnt her book.

25:05.213 --> 25:07.340
"To Theodore Laurence,
who has been my friend

25:07.507 --> 25:09.884
"in my hour
of darkest affliction,

25:10.051 --> 25:13.721
"my papier mâché
model of a horse,

25:13.888 --> 25:15.473
"with apologies
for shouting at him

25:15.640 --> 25:17.558
when he said it
hadn't any neck..."

25:17.725 --> 25:19.519
It hadn't any neck.

25:19.685 --> 25:20.937
You were right.

25:21.103 --> 25:22.188
"And to Beth,

25:22.355 --> 25:24.482
if she lives after me..."

25:24.649 --> 25:27.485
I'm not reading
any more of this.

25:27.652 --> 25:29.570
It's one apology
after another.

25:29.737 --> 25:31.364
You aren't even sick, Amy.

25:31.531 --> 25:33.074
You are not going to die.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.408
I will someday.

25:35.618 --> 25:38.246
Everybody does.

25:38.412 --> 25:40.540
And I don't want to depart
this earth ashamed of myself.

25:43.834 --> 25:47.213
I could be a better person,
Laurie.

25:47.380 --> 25:48.839
I've known that for a while now.

25:51.050 --> 25:52.301
I think that too.

25:53.970 --> 25:55.846
About me?

25:57.473 --> 25:59.433
About myself.

26:05.731 --> 26:07.316
Wait.

26:07.483 --> 26:10.903
Laurie, can you add
that I'd like all my curls

26:11.070 --> 26:12.321
cut off and given away

26:12.488 --> 26:13.864
to the people
who have loved me?

26:14.031 --> 26:17.827
If you want to look revolting
in your coffin,

26:17.994 --> 26:20.454
that is entirely
up to you.

26:46.105 --> 26:47.648
If I didn't see
the sweetness

26:47.815 --> 26:49.775
and the beauty
of your nature before,

26:49.942 --> 26:52.445
I see it now.

26:52.612 --> 26:54.947
If I didn't know
what a deep and tender place

26:55.114 --> 26:58.409
you held in my heart,
I know it now.

26:58.576 --> 27:01.245
And I know that living
for others has worth,

27:01.412 --> 27:03.873
because it's what
you were doing all along.

27:04.040 --> 27:07.877
And I want to say
thank you.

27:08.044 --> 27:10.463
Do you hear me?

27:10.630 --> 27:15.384
Do you hear me?

27:49.919 --> 27:52.546
If you can send
for your mother,

27:52.713 --> 27:54.006
then you should.

28:01.555 --> 28:04.058
Wh-Where are you going,
Jo?

28:04.225 --> 28:07.019
To send for Marmee.

28:07.186 --> 28:09.438
We held out and held out,
and now Beth might be dead

28:09.605 --> 28:11.023
before she
can get here.

28:11.190 --> 28:12.316
Jo.

28:12.483 --> 28:16.487
I telegraphed her
yesterday.

28:16.654 --> 28:18.739
But she can't leave Father--
I told you that.

28:18.906 --> 28:21.283
Why do you never listen
to anything I say, Laurie?

28:21.450 --> 28:22.952
Because I want
what's best for you.

28:25.121 --> 28:28.874
She's already
on the train.

28:35.131 --> 28:37.633
I keep looking at the clock.

28:37.800 --> 28:41.011
I don't know how the hands
can move so slowly.

28:41.178 --> 28:42.680
The minute
it chimes midnight,

28:42.847 --> 28:44.932
I'm leaving to fetch your mother
from the station.

28:45.099 --> 28:47.268
I have to go
back up.

28:47.435 --> 28:48.602
It's Meg's turn
to have a rest.

28:48.769 --> 28:51.313
Will you take
some of the claret up

28:51.480 --> 28:52.982
for Beth?

28:53.149 --> 28:54.233
Grandfather sent it for her.

28:54.400 --> 28:55.609
He thought
it would be fortifying.

28:55.776 --> 29:00.114
Beth can't swallow anything,
Laurie.

29:00.281 --> 29:02.658
Does nobody
understand that?

29:02.825 --> 29:04.827
She doesn't even look
like my Beth anymore.

29:04.994 --> 29:06.287
It's like she's already gone,

29:06.454 --> 29:08.706
and she's taken
half my soul with her,

29:08.873 --> 29:13.169
and I can't find God
in any of this.

29:13.335 --> 29:15.629
We have no mother
and no father

29:15.796 --> 29:18.048
to help us to endure it.

29:18.215 --> 29:19.467
Can you imagine
how that feels?

29:19.633 --> 29:20.926
Yes.

29:21.093 --> 29:25.514
I can.

29:25.681 --> 29:28.392
Forgive me, Teddy.

29:43.449 --> 29:45.618
I'll help you to endure it.

29:47.995 --> 29:51.999
Marmee used to do that.

29:52.166 --> 29:54.293
She'll be doing it again
by daybreak.

29:54.460 --> 29:55.920
Thanks to you.

29:56.086 --> 29:57.755
I was afraid you might
let fly at me.

29:57.922 --> 29:59.632
Not this time.

29:59.799 --> 30:02.927
I quite like it
when you let fly.

30:04.512 --> 30:07.097
And you're always sorry
afterwards.

30:07.264 --> 30:08.724
Did I say I was sorry
for letting fly

30:08.891 --> 30:12.686
that day we drove Meg
to the Moffats'?

30:12.853 --> 30:14.104
No.

30:14.271 --> 30:15.731
Well, I was.

30:15.898 --> 30:18.359
And I am.

30:18.526 --> 30:20.986
I just get mad, and wild,

30:21.153 --> 30:22.780
at the thought of someone

30:22.947 --> 30:25.658
coming to carry
my sister off.

30:25.825 --> 30:27.159
Somebody will come

30:27.326 --> 30:29.078
and carry you off
one day.

30:29.245 --> 30:30.830
I don't want them to.

30:46.178 --> 30:47.346
Teddy?

30:49.640 --> 30:51.141
Please.

30:53.769 --> 30:56.355
Please just be
my comfortable friend.

31:00.693 --> 31:03.112
That's better.

31:45.863 --> 31:47.823
This won't survive
another night,

31:47.990 --> 31:49.450
in that cold wind.

31:52.119 --> 31:56.874
I thought that
if I put it here,

31:57.041 --> 31:58.667
it will be
the first thing she sees

31:58.834 --> 32:00.085
when she opens her eyes.

32:00.252 --> 32:01.378
And the second thing
she'll see

32:01.545 --> 32:04.214
will be
our mother's face.

32:06.175 --> 32:09.845
If God spares her,
I will never complain again.

32:10.012 --> 32:11.513
If God spares her,

32:11.680 --> 32:13.223
I will love Him
all my days.

32:13.390 --> 32:16.644
But if this
is what life is--

32:16.810 --> 32:18.896
if it's going to be
as hard as this--

32:19.063 --> 32:21.148
I don't know
how we'll ever get through it.

32:23.525 --> 32:26.028
Beth?

32:27.321 --> 32:29.740
Her hands are colder.

32:40.668 --> 32:41.835
It's Marmee.

32:42.002 --> 32:43.796
She's home.

32:55.683 --> 32:58.394
Marmee!

32:58.560 --> 33:01.814
The fever's turned,
and she's breathing natural.

33:01.981 --> 33:03.273
Praise be given.

33:08.779 --> 33:09.989
Beth.

33:10.155 --> 33:12.700
Oh, Beth,
my darling girl.

33:19.039 --> 33:20.874
Did Father come
with you?

33:21.041 --> 33:22.167
No.

33:22.334 --> 33:24.128
But he is getting better.

33:24.294 --> 33:27.881
So much better.

33:28.048 --> 33:31.719
I need to sleep now,
Marmee.

33:41.395 --> 33:44.273

outside any longer.

34:43.248 --> 34:45.042
I thought I'd smuggle them in
while Hannah's out at church.

34:45.209 --> 34:47.711
I will deny all knowledge of
them being brought indoors.

34:47.878 --> 34:50.005
Besides, I'm in
Hannah's good books

34:50.172 --> 34:52.925
for sitting and watching
the pudding while it steams.

34:58.138 --> 34:59.640
Do you want to tell me
anything?

34:59.807 --> 35:00.891
Yes.

35:01.058 --> 35:04.228
But it's about Meg,
not me.

35:04.394 --> 35:06.647
She told me all about
her visit to the Moffats'.

35:06.814 --> 35:09.858
She came to me
a day or so ago.

35:10.025 --> 35:14.780
I had hoped you would come to
me, in your own chosen time.

35:17.324 --> 35:18.450
Marmee.

35:21.161 --> 35:27.584
In the summer, Mr. Brooke
stole Meg's glove,

35:27.751 --> 35:31.547
and he keeps it
in his pocket.

35:31.713 --> 35:36.385
Laurie saw.

35:36.552 --> 35:38.053
In his pocket,
Marmee.

35:38.220 --> 35:40.639
Isn't that a dreadful
state of things?

35:45.227 --> 35:48.605
Do you think
Meg cares for John?

35:48.772 --> 35:50.983
John?

35:51.150 --> 35:52.317
While we were
in Washington,

35:52.484 --> 35:54.903
your father and I started
to call Mr. Brooke

35:55.070 --> 35:56.905
by his Christian name.

35:57.072 --> 36:00.868
As he has no family,
I think he likes it.

36:01.034 --> 36:04.288
And we like him.

36:04.454 --> 36:08.208
He spoke to us very sincerely
about Meg.

36:08.375 --> 36:11.170
But he stole her glove.

36:11.336 --> 36:14.298
And never said a word
about it to her face.

36:14.464 --> 36:16.049
Why are you so angry, Jo?

36:16.216 --> 36:19.928
Because they'll go lovering
all over the house,

36:20.095 --> 36:21.763
and we'll have
to dodge them.

36:21.930 --> 36:23.182
Because he'll scratch up
some sort of fortune

36:23.348 --> 36:24.516
and drag her away

36:24.683 --> 36:26.018
and tear a great hole
in the family,

36:26.185 --> 36:27.811
and it will be the end
of the way things are.

36:27.978 --> 36:29.354
Why do you object
so much?

36:29.521 --> 36:31.398
It's natural,
and right,

36:31.565 --> 36:33.275
that you should all
go to homes

36:33.442 --> 36:34.443
of your own,
in time.

36:34.610 --> 36:37.404
I'd marry Meg myself,
if I could.

36:37.571 --> 36:39.740
If it would keep her
safe and close.

36:39.907 --> 36:41.992
I think that would be
a very odd arrangement.

36:44.411 --> 36:46.371
Your father and I
have told Meg

36:46.538 --> 36:48.165
all about John's interest.

36:48.332 --> 36:50.000
And that we insist

36:50.167 --> 36:52.628
on a three-year courtship
before marriage.

36:52.794 --> 36:54.630
Three years, Marmee?

36:54.796 --> 36:56.340
That's no time at all.

36:56.506 --> 36:58.342
Well, I would like to keep
all of my girls

36:58.508 --> 36:59.760
for as long as I can.

36:59.927 --> 37:02.429
But I also want
real love,

37:02.596 --> 37:07.017
for all of you,
from good men.

37:07.184 --> 37:09.770
The former
takes time to flourish,

37:09.937 --> 37:13.690
and the latter
are not lightly found.

37:14.775 --> 37:16.526
Meg doesn't love John yet.

37:16.693 --> 37:18.403
But she will.

37:18.570 --> 37:21.323
And everyone
will have to bear it.

I don't come downstairs
until much later usually.

39:04.509 --> 39:07.637
Today isn't
a usual sort of day, Beth.

39:20.359 --> 39:22.194
I bought you
a bag of oranges.

39:22.361 --> 39:24.571
Is that the wrong thing?

39:24.738 --> 39:25.781
I thought
it would be better than nuts,

39:25.947 --> 39:27.074
in the circumstances.

39:27.240 --> 39:28.909
What circumstances?

39:29.076 --> 39:30.410
Weren't you
at the dentist?

39:32.120 --> 39:33.538
No.

39:35.665 --> 39:37.959
I just had a story accepted
by a publisher.

39:39.294 --> 39:41.213
"The Ashes of the Peacock."

39:41.380 --> 39:42.547
Is that the one
where the Duke goes mad

39:42.714 --> 39:43.799
after he wins a haunted mirror
in a card game?

39:43.965 --> 39:45.133
No, it's the one
with the chase

39:45.300 --> 39:46.676
in the catacombs
of Paris.

39:46.843 --> 39:48.595
There's a duel,
two people drink hemlock.

39:48.762 --> 39:50.472
Oh, Jo!
Oh no, Laurie--

39:50.639 --> 39:53.016
don't you dare try any
of that kissing lark again.

39:53.183 --> 39:54.434
We haven't been drinking
any claret,

39:54.601 --> 39:56.269
so there's really
no excuse.

39:56.436 --> 39:58.772
I shall content myself
with a cry of

39:58.939 --> 40:00.065
"All Hail Josephine March,

40:00.232 --> 40:03.360
celebrated
American authoress!"

40:06.446 --> 40:09.241
This time last year
I was a bad-tempered girl

40:09.408 --> 40:10.492
complaining that
she wasn't getting

40:10.659 --> 40:11.743
any Christmas presents.

40:11.910 --> 40:13.995
I was the loneliest boy
on earth.

40:14.162 --> 40:17.791
I don't know
who that girl is anymore.

40:17.958 --> 40:19.251
I want to be her again,

40:19.418 --> 40:22.003
because she didn't
know anything.

40:22.170 --> 40:24.297
She didn't know
what would be savaged

40:24.464 --> 40:26.466
and almost lost.

40:26.633 --> 40:28.510
And yet I don't want
to be her,

40:28.677 --> 40:30.887
because of all
that I've gained.

40:31.054 --> 40:33.849
It's a happy Christmas
this year, isn't it?

40:34.015 --> 40:35.767
Happier.

40:35.934 --> 40:39.104
Jo, I came to find you
for a reason.

40:39.271 --> 40:41.106
You didn't tell anyone
where you were going.

40:41.273 --> 40:42.941
You're needed at home.

41:00.083 --> 41:02.335
Mr. Laurence, your piano.

41:08.383 --> 41:10.177
Jo.

41:12.888 --> 41:14.181
You're home.

41:18.935 --> 41:22.022
You're home,
and you're truly well again?

41:22.189 --> 41:26.568
I am as whole
as ever I shall be.

41:58.433 --> 41:59.976
- Yes?
- Dearest.

42:00.143 --> 42:01.645
There's someone here
to see you.

42:01.811 --> 42:03.104
Ah.

42:06.399 --> 42:07.526
Oh.

42:09.319 --> 42:11.154
I thank you, John,

42:11.321 --> 42:13.657
for the loyalty
you've shown us,

42:13.823 --> 42:15.867
and the service
you are about to give

42:16.034 --> 42:17.911
to our country.

42:18.078 --> 42:19.996
It is my honor
and my privilege, sir.

42:20.163 --> 42:21.706
Sit?

42:21.873 --> 42:24.167
Dearest,
he's here to see Meg.

42:27.546 --> 42:28.797
Ah!

42:34.761 --> 42:36.096
I polished your
silver toilette set

42:36.263 --> 42:38.431
and put it back
in your bedroom.

42:38.598 --> 42:40.684
Hmm, then get your tippet.

42:40.850 --> 42:42.227
I wish to address your parents
about your future,

42:42.394 --> 42:45.063
and that
of your sister Josephine.

42:45.230 --> 42:48.650
Great ungainly
windmill of a girl.

42:48.817 --> 42:51.486
I need a poised
and punctilious companion,

42:51.653 --> 42:53.738
and a refined one.

42:53.905 --> 42:57.200
I am resolved that
you shall replace her.

43:03.248 --> 43:05.000
You enlisted.

43:05.166 --> 43:06.459
I said I would.

43:06.626 --> 43:08.211
And I'm a man
of my word.

43:08.378 --> 43:11.548
Jo, would you grant me
a private interview with Meg?

43:11.715 --> 43:12.966
I'll tell him
to go away,

43:13.133 --> 43:14.509
if you don't care
to talk to him.

43:14.676 --> 43:15.760
Don't.

43:15.927 --> 43:19.681
Because I do.

43:41.703 --> 43:43.830
Your hands
are trembling.

43:47.584 --> 43:48.918
Please don't tell me
you're afraid of me.

43:49.085 --> 43:50.545
How could I
be afraid of you,

43:50.712 --> 43:52.672
when you've been
so kind to my father?

43:52.839 --> 43:54.257
I still don't like
to make you tremble.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.929
I won't take your hand again
if you don't wish it.

44:00.096 --> 44:04.684
I shall only
ask you this:

44:04.851 --> 44:08.563
do you, or could you,
care for me, even a little?

44:08.730 --> 44:10.940
I...

44:12.942 --> 44:14.152
don't know.

44:16.446 --> 44:20.575
I shall wait,
and I shall fight,

44:20.742 --> 44:24.454
and if I'm spared,
I shall come home and work.

44:24.621 --> 44:27.374
And even if
you can't promise me your love

44:27.540 --> 44:29.167
as a reward
at the end of my endeavors,

44:29.334 --> 44:32.712
I shall not falter,

44:32.879 --> 44:35.215
but only pray that my efforts
are not in vain.

44:35.382 --> 44:37.759
And that you'll choose
to love me,

44:37.926 --> 44:41.805
as much as I love you.

44:44.974 --> 44:48.061
And what if I don't choose?

44:48.228 --> 44:50.021
I will have to try
to bear it.

44:51.272 --> 44:52.774
Ah!

44:52.941 --> 44:54.776
I've come to see my nephew.

44:54.943 --> 44:56.361
As the door to the street
was ajar,

44:56.528 --> 44:58.571
and neither hide nor hair
of a maid in evidence,

44:58.738 --> 45:02.367
I thought I would show myself
into the parlor.

45:04.577 --> 45:07.664
Would you remove
this fancywork, thank you.

45:12.043 --> 45:15.463
Then explain the presence of
this military gentleman,

45:15.630 --> 45:18.174
and the reason why your cheeks
are peony pink.

45:18.341 --> 45:21.886
I daresay the two circumstances
are connected.

45:22.053 --> 45:23.638
This is Mr. Brooke,
Aunt March.

45:23.805 --> 45:24.931
My father's
friend.

45:25.098 --> 45:26.182
Rook?

45:26.349 --> 45:28.435
Hmm, not a name
I've ever heard

45:28.601 --> 45:30.729
in connection
with the better families

45:30.895 --> 45:32.272
of Massachusetts.

45:32.439 --> 45:34.399
His name is Brooke,
Aunt March.

45:34.566 --> 45:36.359
And until he enlisted,

45:36.526 --> 45:38.403
he was tutor
to Mr. Laurence's grandson.

45:38.570 --> 45:40.822
Oh, of course, the tutor.

45:40.989 --> 45:43.783
A head full of notions,
and coffers full of air.

45:43.950 --> 45:46.828
If you harbor thoughts
of mischief

45:46.995 --> 45:48.580
towards my great-niece,

45:48.747 --> 45:50.915
I insist
that you divulge them.

45:51.082 --> 45:53.293
There is no mischief in me,
ma'am.

45:53.460 --> 45:56.296
But I have just made
a proposal of marriage.

45:56.463 --> 45:58.882
And did you accept him,
Margaret?

45:59.048 --> 46:01.634
No,
she did not.

46:01.801 --> 46:02.927
Good.

46:03.094 --> 46:06.139
Because if you do,
you will never see

46:06.306 --> 46:07.682
one penny of my money.

46:07.849 --> 46:09.350
I will marry whom I please,
Aunt March.

46:09.517 --> 46:11.519
And you can leave your money
to anyone you like.

46:11.686 --> 46:13.354
Hmm.

46:13.521 --> 46:15.899
There is a defect of character
one encounters in the young,

46:16.065 --> 46:17.901
when they
are engulfed

46:18.067 --> 46:20.153
by intimations
of romance.

46:20.320 --> 46:22.822
I call it the spice
of perversity,

46:22.989 --> 46:27.035
and it leads to hot heads
and bitter reflection.

46:27.202 --> 46:30.455
And if you don't believe me,
pray consult your parents.

46:31.998 --> 46:34.417
They had no more worldly wisdom
than a pair of babies either.

46:34.584 --> 46:36.002
And I'm very glad
of it!

46:36.169 --> 46:38.797
For they made
as beautiful a match

46:38.963 --> 46:40.298
as I have ever seen,

46:40.465 --> 46:41.883
and they care for nothing
but my happiness.

46:42.050 --> 46:44.594
I wish they cared
to teach you your duty.

46:44.761 --> 46:48.014
Which is to respect your elders,

46:48.181 --> 46:50.058
marry well, and provide
for your family.

46:50.225 --> 46:51.518
I will marry well,

46:51.684 --> 46:54.062
because John loves me.

46:55.313 --> 46:56.815
And I love him.

46:59.901 --> 47:02.028
Well if that
is your conviction,

47:02.195 --> 47:04.572
I wash my hands
of the entire affair.

47:07.242 --> 47:10.370
Expect nothing from me
when you marry,

47:10.537 --> 47:12.372
or when I am laid
in earth.

47:12.539 --> 47:16.167
For I say this, and I say it
plainly: I am done with you.

47:23.132 --> 47:24.342
You just told her
you love me.

47:24.509 --> 47:25.969
I...

47:26.135 --> 47:28.763
I didn't know I did,
until she abused you.

47:28.930 --> 47:31.099
But I know it now.

Father...

50:49.505 --> 50:51.174
May I speak with you?

50:51.340 --> 50:54.093
Is it about
Meg's wedding?

50:54.260 --> 50:56.137
No, Father, it is not.

50:56.304 --> 50:57.972
In which case,
you may speak with me

50:58.139 --> 50:59.432
to your heart's content.

50:59.599 --> 51:03.352
I have spent
the last several weeks

51:03.519 --> 51:08.024
stretched to my utmost
on topics as far-reaching

51:08.191 --> 51:09.484
and as strange to me

51:09.650 --> 51:13.654
as veils versus bonnets,
cake versus pie,

51:13.821 --> 51:16.866
and the minimum number
of scuttles and dusters

51:17.033 --> 51:19.410
required
when setting up home.

51:19.577 --> 51:21.996
To converse
on any other subject

51:22.163 --> 51:25.458
can only be a joy to me.

51:27.627 --> 51:30.505
Well, an offer-- in writing--

51:30.671 --> 51:32.006
to publish your novel

51:32.173 --> 51:34.258
is not
an inconsiderable thing, Jo.

51:34.425 --> 51:35.843
That's why
I'm showing it to you.

51:36.010 --> 51:37.303
And I have to say,

51:37.470 --> 51:39.972
$300 is not
an inconsiderable thing, either.

51:40.139 --> 51:42.016
You must not let
the size

51:42.183 --> 51:44.644
of the sum
they offer sway you.

51:44.811 --> 51:45.978
They say here

51:46.145 --> 51:49.482
they want
"significant amendments."

51:52.193 --> 51:54.153
Money isn't everything.

51:54.320 --> 51:55.863
No, but we need more of it
in this house.

51:56.030 --> 52:00.034
I'm blessed to have found
a position as minister.

52:00.201 --> 52:01.994
If my parish is a small one,

52:02.161 --> 52:04.664
and the living lean,
I'm no less grateful.

52:04.831 --> 52:07.125
Father, I only earn five
or six dollars apiece

52:07.291 --> 52:08.501
from my
<i>Spread Eagle</i> stories,

52:08.668 --> 52:11.129
but it paid
for the rug to be mended,

52:11.295 --> 52:13.131
and for you to have
new galoshes last winter.

52:13.297 --> 52:15.925
It pays for beef,
so that Beth can have broth

52:16.092 --> 52:17.677
to try to build her up.

52:17.844 --> 52:20.138
She has never been well since
she had the scarlet fever.

52:20.304 --> 52:22.098
And the care
you take of her

52:22.265 --> 52:23.850
does you
every credit.

52:24.016 --> 52:26.644
But you must also
nurture yourself.

52:26.811 --> 52:28.521
And that means
to nurture your writing.

52:28.688 --> 52:29.856
It's more sacred

52:30.022 --> 52:32.024
than you allow
yourself to think.

52:32.191 --> 52:33.609
It isn't sacred.

52:33.776 --> 52:36.070
It's essential to me,
but it isn't sacred.

52:36.237 --> 52:37.738
There are too many things

52:37.905 --> 52:39.532
I have to achieve by it,
Father!

52:39.699 --> 52:43.202
Don't spoil your book
for the sake of $300, Jo!

52:43.369 --> 52:45.746
You have more talent
than you know,

52:45.913 --> 52:48.082
and you should
let your work ripen.

52:48.249 --> 52:49.876
Like you do?

52:50.042 --> 52:54.255
I've been working
on my book for 20 years.

52:54.422 --> 52:58.551
And, yes, it is starting
to bear fruit.

52:58.718 --> 53:02.013
That is a wonderful
accomplishment, Father.

53:02.180 --> 53:03.931
And a luxury
I'm not convinced I have.

53:09.687 --> 53:10.855
She won't wait.

53:11.022 --> 53:12.690
I'm telling you now,
she won't wait.

53:12.857 --> 53:15.484
And she will profit more
from the trial

53:15.651 --> 53:18.905
than by feeling
she's been thwarted.

53:19.071 --> 53:20.406
Do you think
it will be a trial?

53:20.573 --> 53:22.575
Well, we can't save Jo
from criticism,

53:22.742 --> 53:24.493
if it comes her way.

53:24.660 --> 53:28.623
She has to send her book
into the world,

53:28.789 --> 53:30.249
just as we have
to send our children.

53:32.793 --> 53:35.671
Well, Meg isn't
going far.

53:35.838 --> 53:38.341
That little house
isn't ten minutes' walk away.

53:38.507 --> 53:40.885
Even if they don't
have a cellar for the coal,

53:41.052 --> 53:44.347
or room for a dining table.

53:47.058 --> 53:50.436
I'm not sure
about this bonnet now.

53:50.603 --> 53:53.356
And I can't rest for thinking
that the cats will get the ham.

53:57.151 --> 53:59.528
Are all the weddings going
to be as bad as this?

54:04.700 --> 54:06.661
Shhh--
come on, come on.

54:35.564 --> 54:38.359
I found more hairpins.

54:38.526 --> 54:40.653
I want to be sure
the veil's fixed on.

54:40.820 --> 54:42.113
<i>Just a minute!</i>

55:13.352 --> 55:14.520
I want to kiss
you all so much.

55:14.687 --> 55:16.981
But I'm afraid
that kisses

55:17.148 --> 55:19.859
would turn into me throwing my
arms around you and...

55:21.527 --> 55:25.823
All this perfection
will be utterly undone.

55:27.533 --> 55:31.704
Here are the hairpins,
in case you need them.

55:31.871 --> 55:33.372
See you all downstairs.

55:55.061 --> 55:55.978
Get off you!

55:59.940 --> 56:02.193
May the Lord look
with favor upon you

56:02.360 --> 56:05.321
and so fill you with grace,

56:05.488 --> 56:08.616
that you may live together
in this life,

56:08.783 --> 56:12.536
and in the world to come
have life everlasting.

56:12.703 --> 56:15.206
Amen.

56:15.373 --> 56:16.916
Amen.

56:21.170 --> 56:24.048
You may kiss the bride.

56:24.215 --> 56:25.383
Oh, I'm sorry, John.

56:25.549 --> 56:27.802
But the first kiss
is for Marmee.

56:39.855 --> 56:41.190
I always said

56:41.357 --> 56:44.276
that my pearls would go

56:44.443 --> 56:47.905
to the first of my great-nieces
to become engaged.

56:53.953 --> 56:55.830
And if I must present them
to a bride,

56:55.996 --> 56:57.706
and not to a fiancée

56:57.873 --> 56:59.917
with a new ring
sparkling on her hand,

57:00.084 --> 57:03.129
that is no one's doing
but my own,

57:03.295 --> 57:08.217
and though I do not care to,
I entreat your pardon.

57:08.384 --> 57:11.971
Thank you,
Aunt March.

57:15.099 --> 57:16.559
Thank you.

57:42.877 --> 57:43.961
Here, sit.

57:46.672 --> 57:48.841
I thought you'd be treading
on my feet more.

57:49.008 --> 57:50.217
I'm counting
like crazy.

57:50.384 --> 57:53.429
You just can't see
my lips move.

58:00.186 --> 58:02.897
Beth's fading, Laurie.

58:03.063 --> 58:04.815
She'll be all right.

58:06.192 --> 58:07.568
Everything will be all right.

58:07.735 --> 58:09.236
Beth will dance
at your wedding too.

58:09.403 --> 58:12.031
My wedding?
Oh, no Laurie.

58:12.198 --> 58:14.325
There should always be at least
one old maid in a family,

58:14.492 --> 58:17.036
and I've made up my mind
that it's going to be me.

58:17.203 --> 58:19.622
Jo.

58:19.788 --> 58:21.540
I miss you all the time
when I'm away at college.

58:21.707 --> 58:23.125
No, you don't!

58:23.292 --> 58:25.878
You fall in love with a
different girl every fortnight.

58:26.045 --> 58:29.465
Can we change
the subject, please?

58:29.632 --> 58:32.510
We can,
but it won't go away.

58:32.676 --> 58:35.554
Time won't stand still,
Jo.

58:35.721 --> 58:37.598
I wish it would.

58:40.976 --> 58:42.770
And I don't want any more
talk of love.

59:08.087 --> 59:09.838
I need to not live
out my entire life

59:10.005 --> 59:12.800
in the tiny town
where I was born.

59:12.967 --> 59:15.427
<i>You never let people
see your soft side,</i>

59:15.594 --> 59:17.096
but everyone who cares
knows it's there.

59:17.263 --> 59:18.389
You know so much more
than I do.

59:18.556 --> 59:21.225
<i>That only makes me learned.</i>

59:21.392 --> 59:22.851
<i>It does not make me wise.</i>

59:23.018 --> 59:24.895
<i>Can we go back to being happy</i>

59:25.062 --> 59:26.021
like we were before?

59:26.188 --> 59:27.189
Not quite.

59:27.356 --> 59:29.149
<i>We were children before</i>

59:29.316 --> 59:30.901
<i>and we aren't any longer.</i>

59:31.068 --> 59:33.571
<i>You're going to have
to go on a journey.</i>

59:33.737 --> 59:36.240
<i>And you mustn't be afraid.</i>

59:36.407 --> 59:39.702
<i>You were always braver
than you know.</i>
