WEBVTT

00:02.630 --> 00:03.800
Damn it.
Agendas?

00:03.850 --> 00:05.760
You left them in the printer.
Thank you.

00:05.800 --> 00:07.370
This is your Sunday look?

00:07.410 --> 00:08.890
Elegance has no schedule.

00:08.940 --> 00:10.420
Cookie?
Oh, yes.

00:10.460 --> 00:12.990
I'll take a cookie.
Mike?

00:13.030 --> 00:14.860
No.
 How about in a circle?

00:14.900 --> 00:15.990
Yeah. Excuse me.

00:16.030 --> 00:17.340
Sorry. Uh, yeah.

00:17.380 --> 00:18.926
Uh, right there next to the secretary.
Yeah.

00:18.950 --> 00:20.080
I got you.

00:20.120 --> 00:21.250
Who put their bag there?

00:21.300 --> 00:22.820
It's Mike B's.

00:22.860 --> 00:24.820
Next time you got to pee
on the chair.

00:26.610 --> 00:28.000
Hey, Jeff.

00:28.040 --> 00:29.520
Yeah, okay, I'll let her in.

00:29.570 --> 00:32.140
No, no, no, no. I'll let her in.

00:32.180 --> 00:33.570
You have to go upstairs.

00:33.610 --> 00:35.090
Oh, that's right. Stevie.

00:35.140 --> 00:36.620
Come on.
Yes. I'm right here.

00:36.660 --> 00:37.920
Time to go into exile.

00:37.970 --> 00:39.840
I didn't make up
the rules about...

00:39.880 --> 00:41.646
White House employees
staying out of campaigns.

00:41.670 --> 00:43.906
And the two of you, shoo.
Guys, did neither of you hear the timer?

00:43.930 --> 00:46.126
Oh, shoot, sorry. You
put me on cleanup duty. Hey, guys,

00:46.150 --> 00:47.850
Ah.A presidential campaign

00:47.890 --> 00:49.126
is about to kick off
in our living room.Ah.

00:49.150 --> 00:50.670
A little excitement. I'm very excited.

00:51.850 --> 00:53.086
Ooh, there we go.
Great British Baking Show?

00:53.110 --> 00:55.810
You kidding?
It's Shark Week.

00:55.850 --> 00:57.030
Okay! People!

00:57.070 --> 00:58.940
Now that everybody's here...
That's my seat.

00:58.990 --> 01:00.510
I would like to call to order

01:00.550 --> 01:03.820
the first official Elizabeth
McCord kitchen cabinet. Yeah!

01:03.860 --> 01:04.910
I like it.

01:04.950 --> 01:06.560
And just as a reminder,

01:06.600 --> 01:08.666
you're all here voluntarily
outside your government duties.

01:08.690 --> 01:10.910
That means that nothing
we talk about tonight,

01:10.960 --> 01:13.000
by law, can be discussed
at the State Department.

01:13.050 --> 01:14.740
No accidental

01:14.790 --> 01:16.140
breakroom check-ins.

01:16.180 --> 01:17.480
No e-mails from State.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.100
And now

01:19.140 --> 01:20.726
I will turn this meeting over
to the next president

01:20.750 --> 01:23.580
of the United States,
Elizabeth McCord.Aw.

01:25.140 --> 01:27.580
Thank you, everyone.

01:27.630 --> 01:30.020
Oh! And I have to thank Stevie,

01:30.060 --> 01:32.280
especially for those cookies.

01:32.330 --> 01:33.696
Yes, thank you, Stevie. Thank you, Stevie.

01:33.720 --> 01:34.980
I made them, too.

01:35.020 --> 01:36.346
Can we have an oven
on the tour bus?

01:36.370 --> 01:38.510
No.Not really. But sort of.

01:38.550 --> 01:40.460
That would be...
Okay, forget it.

01:40.510 --> 01:43.990
Number one topic tonight
is the launch of the campaign,

01:44.030 --> 01:45.690
which we think will be
in two weeks.

01:45.730 --> 01:46.910
Ten days.
So...

01:46.950 --> 01:49.430
Ten days. Ten days.

01:49.470 --> 01:51.870
Are we, uh, sure
the speech is ready?

01:51.910 --> 01:54.170
It's a masterpiece.
I made a few tweaks.

01:54.220 --> 01:55.780
That brings me
to our next topic,

01:55.830 --> 01:57.156
defining everyone's role
in the campaign.

01:57.180 --> 01:58.870
Most of us will have
the same title

01:58.920 --> 02:00.440
we now have at State.

02:00.480 --> 02:02.010
With a much higher level
of intensity.

02:02.050 --> 02:04.206
This isn't gonna be some cushy
conference in Geneva, people.

02:04.230 --> 02:06.930
This is the longest marathon

02:06.970 --> 02:08.710
of your lives,
running uphill the whole way

02:08.750 --> 02:10.580
with this woman's
campaign agenda

02:10.620 --> 02:12.280
carved into your foreheads.

02:12.320 --> 02:14.020
You got me? Are we joining a cult?

02:14.060 --> 02:15.670
It sounds like a cult. Right?

02:15.720 --> 02:17.940
It's a team, and we're
all in it together,

02:17.980 --> 02:20.500
so for now rest up, get
your annual checkups

02:20.550 --> 02:22.380
and dentist appointments
out of the way,

02:22.420 --> 02:24.460
and try and enjoy the
calm before the storm.

02:24.510 --> 02:25.600
The fight of our lives.

02:25.640 --> 02:27.990
Uh, excuse me. Mom,

02:28.030 --> 02:29.486
security said
that Russell Jackson's here.

02:29.510 --> 02:31.780
Oh. We've got room for him
if he wants in.

02:31.820 --> 02:33.080
We-we do?

02:33.130 --> 02:34.780
Let's take five.

02:34.820 --> 02:36.106
Yeah, hey, there's-there's
more cookies in the kitchen.

02:36.130 --> 02:37.410
Oh, there's cookies?
Yeah.

02:38.220 --> 02:39.910
Hey, Russell.

02:39.960 --> 02:42.920
Didn't realize
I was crashing a party.

02:42.960 --> 02:44.480
You're always on the guest list.

02:45.490 --> 02:47.230
An article's

02:47.270 --> 02:48.620
coming out in the next few days

02:48.660 --> 02:50.060
in the Washington Chronicle

02:50.100 --> 02:52.410
alleging
an intimate relationship

02:52.450 --> 02:55.840
between Elizabeth and Conrad

02:55.890 --> 02:57.110
during their days at CIA.

02:57.150 --> 02:58.630
What?
Okay.

02:58.670 --> 03:00.046
Who's the source?
No, who's the reporter?

03:00.070 --> 03:01.940
Some stringer
named Terrence Robinson.

03:01.980 --> 03:03.916
We don't know where
he's getting his info. Well, that is

03:03.940 --> 03:05.590
straight-up defamation.

03:05.640 --> 03:07.120
No, this is good.

03:07.160 --> 03:08.446
That means they have
nothing in their oppo file

03:08.470 --> 03:09.836
if they're making
stuff up this early.

03:09.860 --> 03:11.250
Unless they're not making it up,

03:11.290 --> 03:12.876
which we'll talk later.
They're making it up, Mike.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.446
All right, well, the Chronicle
called the White House

03:14.470 --> 03:15.820
for comment, and we declined.

03:15.860 --> 03:18.260
Most likely they'll be
reaching out to you next.

03:18.300 --> 03:21.000
Well, I absolutely want
to comment.

03:21.040 --> 03:22.610
Well, that's up to
you and your team.

03:22.650 --> 03:25.310
Obviously you've got more at
stake with your campaign coming.

03:25.350 --> 03:26.830
That's why we're not giving this

03:26.870 --> 03:28.530
any oxygen.

03:28.570 --> 03:30.620
But it's a complete load
of crap.

03:30.660 --> 03:32.620
Ignore it, it's one
news cycle. Answer it,

03:32.660 --> 03:34.530
it follows us the
rest of the campaign.

03:34.580 --> 03:36.750
What if we do some digging
into the reporter?

03:36.800 --> 03:38.606
Discredit the article
as blatantly biased. MIKE: Sure,

03:38.630 --> 03:40.126
wage war on the press
ten days before we announce.

03:40.150 --> 03:41.720
It's a brilliant strategy.

03:41.760 --> 03:44.080
Not answering makes it look
like we have something to hide.

03:47.330 --> 03:49.250
Okay, we push the
announcement three days

03:49.290 --> 03:50.770
until the air is clear.

03:50.810 --> 03:52.160
In the meantime the only thing

03:52.200 --> 03:54.250
you talk about is policy, okay?

03:54.290 --> 03:55.950
Let's get back to the meeting.

03:55.990 --> 03:57.300
Let's go, people!

03:57.340 --> 03:58.780
"She's not likable."

03:58.820 --> 04:01.170
"I don't want to have a beer
with her."

04:02.650 --> 04:04.740
"I hate her voice."
I mean, these are the things

04:04.780 --> 04:06.170
that I was ready for,

04:06.220 --> 04:09.220
but "she slept her
way to the top"?

04:09.270 --> 04:11.700
What century are we in?

04:11.750 --> 04:13.440
It just means they're terrified.

04:13.490 --> 04:15.840
No. This works, Henry.

04:15.880 --> 04:19.230
This taps right
into America's id.

04:19.279 --> 04:23.320
And it works with women
just as well as men.

04:23.370 --> 04:25.460
Well, can you find out
where it's coming from

04:25.500 --> 04:27.540
and shut it down?

04:27.590 --> 04:29.550
I mean,

04:29.590 --> 04:32.900
there were always
these stupid jokes

04:32.940 --> 04:35.160
at CIA about Conrad and me.

04:35.200 --> 04:38.510
Isabelle and I used
to laugh about 'em.

04:40.560 --> 04:44.080
We have to tell the kids.

04:47.090 --> 04:49.090
Yeah, we do.

04:53.790 --> 04:55.090
Morning, ma'am.

04:55.140 --> 04:56.270
Morning.

04:56.310 --> 04:58.400
Hey. I saw your draft

04:58.440 --> 05:01.670
of the Global Climate
Migration Agreement.

05:01.710 --> 05:03.670
You must have been up
half the night.

05:03.710 --> 05:06.020
I'm all right.

05:06.060 --> 05:11.280
You don't seem lit up by the
thrill of negotiating shelter

05:11.330 --> 05:14.550
for the displaced people
of the next hundred years.

05:14.590 --> 05:16.240
Thrill got dampened by this.

05:16.290 --> 05:19.380
From East Asia
and Pacific Affairs.

05:19.420 --> 05:21.250
Oh, what the hell?

05:21.290 --> 05:22.746
We knew China was
trying to break into

05:22.770 --> 05:23.950
the private jet industry.

05:23.990 --> 05:27.650
A custom jet for
General Bo Htun?

05:27.690 --> 05:29.170
Hey, what's going on?

05:29.210 --> 05:32.090
China just violated economic
sanctions against Myanmar.

05:32.130 --> 05:34.920
By selling a private jet
to the military leader

05:34.960 --> 05:37.790
of one of the poorest
countries in Asia.

05:37.830 --> 05:38.986
You know,
why hide the corruption?

05:39.010 --> 05:40.790
It's so much easier this way.

05:40.830 --> 05:43.116
A total slap in the face right
when we're negotiating the deal.

05:43.140 --> 05:45.580
It's China. They're doing it
because they know we need them

05:45.620 --> 05:46.970
on the Climate Migration deal.

05:47.010 --> 05:48.776
One jet sale is worth it
to threaten the whole deal?

05:48.800 --> 05:51.280
I want to put out
a statement. Strong.

05:51.320 --> 05:53.590
Don't hold back. On it.

05:53.630 --> 05:55.280
There is the larger issue.

05:55.330 --> 05:56.940
Yeah, I know.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.420
Myanmar is all but getting away

05:58.460 --> 06:00.420
with the Rohingya massacre.

06:00.460 --> 06:02.600
They've met none of the demands
of repatriation,

06:02.640 --> 06:04.730
hundreds of thousands
of Rohingya people still stuck

06:04.770 --> 06:06.470
in camps in Bangladesh.

06:06.510 --> 06:11.300
And the world is moving on,
playing politics, selling jets.

06:11.340 --> 06:13.690
It's Rwanda all over again.

06:16.870 --> 06:20.310
Nina, get me
our U.N. ambassador.

06:20.350 --> 06:21.310
Of course, ma'am.

06:21.350 --> 06:22.830
I share your outrage.

06:22.880 --> 06:26.180
The Rohingya massacre is one
of the worst human atrocities

06:26.230 --> 06:29.010
in the last 20 years.

06:29.060 --> 06:31.230
And President U Khaing?

06:31.280 --> 06:33.280
Might as well be back
under house arrest.

06:33.320 --> 06:35.450
He's completely under
the thumb of the generals.

06:35.500 --> 06:39.070
Who are getting away
with murder... in a private jet.

06:39.110 --> 06:40.720
Thanks, Jen.

06:40.760 --> 06:42.640
We can step up the sanctions.

06:42.680 --> 06:45.550
Because it worked so well
the first time?

06:47.250 --> 06:49.510
If you really want to go rogue,

06:49.560 --> 06:51.056
we can call an
international criminal tribunal

06:51.080 --> 06:52.820
at the U.N.

06:52.860 --> 06:54.300
Prosecute Bo Htun

06:54.340 --> 06:58.350
and his cronies for violations
to the Geneva Convention

06:58.390 --> 06:59.830
and crimes against humanity.

06:59.870 --> 07:01.650
Well, I like the sound of that.

07:01.700 --> 07:04.530
It's only been done
once before, with Bosnia.

07:04.570 --> 07:06.050
Milo. evic weaponized
mob violence

07:06.090 --> 07:08.206
against a Muslim
ethnic minority. So there's precedent.

07:08.230 --> 07:09.490
We can point up the parallels.

07:09.530 --> 07:11.010
Does this pass at the U.N.?

07:11.060 --> 07:12.840
It could take years.

07:12.880 --> 07:14.280
And even if we get
some convictions,

07:14.320 --> 07:15.816
we'll have no way
to enforce the sentences.

07:15.840 --> 07:17.320
It would put the
regime on notice.

07:17.370 --> 07:20.980
Show 'em that the rest
of the world hasn't looked away.

07:21.020 --> 07:23.680
If the resolution passes,
and for that we need China.

07:23.720 --> 07:25.850
You get the other members.
I'll work on China.

07:25.900 --> 07:27.850
Thank you, Peter. JAY:
So, Nina,

07:27.900 --> 07:30.250
I'm sure you're aware
the State Department

07:30.290 --> 07:32.560
is about to undergo
some changes.

07:32.600 --> 07:34.770
You mean the secretary's
about to announce

07:34.820 --> 07:36.560
her presidential run,
which is so exciting.

07:36.600 --> 07:39.560
I can't discuss that,
but, yes, it's very exciting.

07:39.610 --> 07:42.260
The secretary would like
the incoming team to have

07:42.300 --> 07:43.910
some continuity
for the transition.

07:43.960 --> 07:46.310
We were hoping that you
would be willing to stay.

07:46.350 --> 07:47.740
Of course. I'd be honored.

07:47.790 --> 07:49.880
Deputy Secretary Cushing, right?

07:49.920 --> 07:52.360
Actually, the deputy secretary
has chosen to retire,

07:52.400 --> 07:54.530
and Deputy Secretary Bailey
will step in

07:54.580 --> 07:56.246
for the remainder of
the Dalton administration.

07:56.270 --> 07:58.890
Oh. You'd report to him
in your current capacity.

07:58.930 --> 08:01.086
He's already agreed based on
the secretary's recommendation.

08:01.110 --> 08:03.370
Wonderful.

08:03.410 --> 08:05.980
Uh, thanks, so I'll fill you in
more in the coming days,

08:06.020 --> 08:07.500
but if you'll excuse... Sure.

08:08.900 --> 08:10.850
Uh, Daisy?

08:10.900 --> 08:12.250
Can I grab a moment? Is it me,

08:12.290 --> 08:14.680
or did this coffee take
a serious nosedive?

08:14.730 --> 08:16.860
Blake abdicated coffee duties.

08:16.900 --> 08:18.950
Can he take over
for the campaign?

08:18.990 --> 08:21.600
Uh, sorry.
I forgot about the rule.

08:21.650 --> 08:24.960
We're expecting a call from the
Chronicleasking for comment

08:25.000 --> 08:26.626
on an article alleging
the secretary had a previous

08:26.650 --> 08:28.350
intimate relationship
with the president.

08:28.390 --> 08:30.610
Uh... say that again?

08:30.660 --> 08:32.789
Before he was the president.

08:32.830 --> 08:35.400
Our answer is "no comment."

08:37.450 --> 08:40.010
You realize it's gonna
sound like she did have

08:40.059 --> 08:42.100
an intimate relationship
with the president.

08:42.150 --> 08:43.760
I do.

08:43.799 --> 08:45.800
Talk to Mike B.

08:45.850 --> 08:47.890
Wait, so did she?

08:52.030 --> 08:53.200
Elizabeth.

08:53.240 --> 08:55.590
I'm gonna miss
these conversations.

08:55.640 --> 08:58.470
I'm calling to discuss
your troubled neighbor.

08:58.510 --> 09:01.120
You'll have to be more specific.

09:01.170 --> 09:02.820
Myanmar, the Rohingya people.

09:02.860 --> 09:06.040
Tanks are still torching
whole villages,

09:06.080 --> 09:08.130
soldiers killing mothers
in front of their children,

09:08.170 --> 09:11.480
more than 700,000
forced from their homes.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.480
The economic sanctions
are clearly failing.Mm.

09:14.530 --> 09:15.480
We believe the time has come

09:15.530 --> 09:17.270
to step up our efforts,

09:17.310 --> 09:20.180
and I hope President Li
will join the United States

09:20.230 --> 09:23.320
in calling for
a U.N. special tribunal

09:23.360 --> 09:27.410
to charge General Bo Htun
and his regime with violations

09:27.450 --> 09:30.110
of the Geneva Convention
and crimes against humanity.

09:30.150 --> 09:33.330
As troubling as Myanmar's
actions have been,

09:33.370 --> 09:35.070
China sees this
as a domestic response

09:35.110 --> 09:36.420
to a dissident uprising.

09:36.460 --> 09:37.590
It's not our concern.

09:39.550 --> 09:41.990
Can I speak frankly, Ming?

09:42.030 --> 09:44.950
I think your regime

09:44.990 --> 09:48.170
is afraid that joining
a call for a U.N. tribunal

09:48.210 --> 09:50.170
to prosecute the violation

09:50.210 --> 09:53.650
of human rights might bring
a little too much attention

09:53.700 --> 09:57.480
to China's mistreatment of its
own minority Uyghur population.

09:57.530 --> 09:59.830
That is frank.

09:59.880 --> 10:03.970
Right now the United States
sees a difference

10:04.010 --> 10:05.970
between your unlawful detention

10:06.010 --> 10:09.970
of a persecuted minority
and Myanmar opening fire

10:10.020 --> 10:12.020
on women and children.

10:12.060 --> 10:15.460
But if China continues to
violate the economic sanctions

10:15.500 --> 10:20.680
by selling private jets
to generals in Myanmar,

10:20.720 --> 10:22.330
then we may become
more concerned

10:22.380 --> 10:24.810
about the human rights abuses
in China.

10:24.860 --> 10:27.006
It's always impressive, the
amount of strength leaders wield

10:27.030 --> 10:29.560
when they're about
to leave office.

10:29.600 --> 10:32.340
I'll have plenty of strength
in my next office.

10:32.390 --> 10:35.650
But I'd much prefer
to work with you, Ming.

10:37.220 --> 10:40.700
I can discuss the idea
of a tribunal.

10:40.740 --> 10:43.570
But I suggest you take
a less threatening approach

10:43.620 --> 10:44.400
in your new office.

10:44.440 --> 10:47.180
Whatever that might be.

10:48.320 --> 10:50.400
Damn. Way to sweeten
the moral authority

10:50.450 --> 10:52.100
with a little raw power.

10:52.150 --> 10:54.410
Felt like
it was getting through.

10:54.450 --> 10:55.606
Sorry to interrupt, ma'am. What's up?

10:55.630 --> 10:56.826
We knew you'd want to see this.

10:56.850 --> 10:58.540
Callister's
announcing his campaign.

10:58.590 --> 11:00.980
America, America,
your soul is on the line.

11:01.020 --> 11:04.070
While Washington plays
world cop,

11:04.110 --> 11:07.640
pouring our nation's blood
and treasure into

11:07.680 --> 11:10.470
every broken-down,
lawless country in the world,

11:10.510 --> 11:13.650
the American dream
at home is dying.

11:15.170 --> 11:17.910
Uh, taxed... taxed to death,

11:17.950 --> 11:21.740
invaded by every criminal,
every drug dealer,

11:21.780 --> 11:23.676
every gang member flooding
over our nation's borders.

11:23.700 --> 11:25.270
Kick them out!

11:25.310 --> 11:27.310
People who don't speak
our language, people who

11:27.350 --> 11:28.790
don't respect our flag,

11:28.830 --> 11:31.010
people who don't respect
our god.

11:31.050 --> 11:32.930
What is that?

11:32.970 --> 11:35.670
Is that a campaign announcement
or a call to revolt?

11:35.710 --> 11:37.670
That they don't know
who they are messing with.

11:37.710 --> 11:40.320
We, the people, will rise

11:40.370 --> 11:42.460
to show them
who the real Americans are.

11:42.500 --> 11:44.680
We will rise! We will rise!

11:44.720 --> 11:47.810
When Owen Callister
is president,

11:47.850 --> 11:49.940
there will be no more surrender.

11:49.990 --> 11:51.380
We will rise.

11:51.420 --> 11:55.030
He raised over a million dollars
in less than an hour.

11:55.080 --> 11:56.780
I say, bring it.

11:56.820 --> 11:58.260
We can fight that.

11:58.300 --> 12:02.090
Yeah, except I just finished
begging China

12:02.130 --> 12:05.260
to help us fight nationalism
around the world.

12:05.310 --> 12:07.440
We will rise! We will rise!

12:07.480 --> 12:09.180
And now it's running
for president.

12:09.220 --> 12:10.700
We will rise!

12:10.750 --> 12:14.270
We will rise! We will rise!

12:16.000 --> 12:22.074

contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

12:32.990 --> 12:34.940
Hey.

12:34.990 --> 12:36.290
Hey, Mom.

12:36.340 --> 12:37.860
Is it game night, or...?

12:37.900 --> 12:39.730
No. Uh, Dad said
that you wanted

12:39.780 --> 12:41.650
to talk to us about something.

12:41.690 --> 12:44.210
Yes. Um...

12:44.260 --> 12:45.820
Oh, God.

12:45.870 --> 12:47.480
Uh, right. Hold...

12:47.520 --> 12:48.830
There you are.
Perfect timing.

12:48.870 --> 12:50.390
Kids are all here. I-I'm sorry.

12:50.440 --> 12:52.220
I-I can't...

12:52.270 --> 12:54.050
I can't do this tonight.

12:54.090 --> 12:56.230
You heard Callister's
announcement.

12:56.270 --> 12:57.750
Callister,

12:57.790 --> 13:02.280
this stupid article... it's just
all so ugly, and I'm...

13:02.320 --> 13:03.670
Is something, uh... wrong?

13:03.710 --> 13:04.906
What's, uh, going on? Oh, hi, guys.

13:04.930 --> 13:06.280
Uh, Mom's just really tired.

13:06.320 --> 13:08.240
Let's just do this
some other time, okay?

13:08.280 --> 13:10.150
Oh, sure.
Yeah, that won't leave us

13:10.200 --> 13:13.160
lying awake in bed all night,
wondering if she has cancer.

13:14.810 --> 13:17.460
Okay. Um...

13:17.510 --> 13:19.470
there's this article

13:19.510 --> 13:22.730
coming out
in the next few days, and

13:22.770 --> 13:25.210
it's going to imply that
when I was at the CIA...

13:25.260 --> 13:27.430
It's a hit piece accusing Mom
and President Dalton

13:27.470 --> 13:29.650
of having an affair
20 years ago.

13:29.690 --> 13:31.106
It's not true,
no, it's not true. It is not true.

13:31.130 --> 13:32.350
What?! Who's
behind it?

13:32.390 --> 13:33.570
W-We don't know.

13:33.610 --> 13:35.180
How can they just say that

13:35.220 --> 13:36.740
with no proof? Isn't that slander?

13:36.790 --> 13:39.570
Libel if they publish it.
Look, we just want you guys

13:39.620 --> 13:41.580
to know
that it's gonna be out there

13:41.620 --> 13:43.750
for a few days. That's disgusting.

13:43.800 --> 13:45.800
We're not responding, so it just

13:45.840 --> 13:50.190
goes away with the next crisis,
and... I am so sorry.

13:50.240 --> 13:52.670
You do nothave
to apologize to us.

13:52.720 --> 13:54.720
Wait, wait. So you're just gonna
let them say that?

13:55.760 --> 13:58.640
I'm gonna get attacked a lot.

14:00.420 --> 14:03.900
Just means
they're nervous about me.

14:03.950 --> 14:06.640
Callister's speech will

14:06.690 --> 14:08.300
probably dominate the news
anyway.

14:08.340 --> 14:10.300
Yeah, well,
that's the real scandal.

14:10.340 --> 14:11.650
Thank you.

14:11.690 --> 14:13.520
If it makes you feel

14:13.560 --> 14:16.310
any better, no one
at my school follows the news.

14:19.830 --> 14:22.790
So, um, Kat,
you know how the secretary

14:22.830 --> 14:25.490
was asking us to propose ideas

14:25.530 --> 14:28.880
for workplace improvements
at State

14:28.930 --> 14:31.500
before things,
you know, change over?

14:31.540 --> 14:32.890
I do.

14:32.930 --> 14:35.150
Well, I was doing some research

14:35.190 --> 14:37.850
into the so-called
"potty parity initiative,"

14:37.890 --> 14:40.460
the move to create
an equal number of bathrooms

14:40.500 --> 14:42.900
for men and women
in all federal buildings.

14:42.940 --> 14:45.380
Mm-hmm. It died in
committee. I'm familiar.

14:45.420 --> 14:47.550
Once again, gender
neutral bathrooms,

14:47.600 --> 14:49.340
and we'd never
have this problem.

14:49.380 --> 14:50.860
Oh, well, one day.

14:50.910 --> 14:52.430
You were saying?

14:52.470 --> 14:54.690
So I was thinking, uh,
maybe a half-step would be

14:54.740 --> 14:58.220
to get tampon dispensers
in all the women's bathrooms.

14:58.260 --> 15:00.130
Oh.Um, not free tampons,

15:00.180 --> 15:02.000
although that would
be good, too.

15:02.050 --> 15:03.790
Yeah. No,
that's doable.

15:03.830 --> 15:07.050
I'll, uh... I'll take it
to the secretary. Thank you.

15:08.100 --> 15:10.360
Oh, and also, um...

15:10.400 --> 15:12.800
Jay mentioned I
would be staying on

15:12.840 --> 15:15.020
with the transition team
for Acting Secretary Bailey?

15:15.060 --> 15:16.710
Yup, yup, yup. I'm super grateful

15:16.760 --> 15:18.736
for the opportunity, and please
pass that on to the secretary.

15:18.760 --> 15:20.256
Okay. But I'd like to
request a transfer.

15:20.280 --> 15:23.370
Oh. Can I ask why?

15:23.420 --> 15:27.160
I know it's only hearsay,

15:27.200 --> 15:28.770
but I've heard...

15:28.810 --> 15:30.820
I've heard some
things from women

15:30.860 --> 15:32.226
who have worked
for Deputy Secretary,

15:32.250 --> 15:34.300
and I'd rather not
put myself in a position

15:34.340 --> 15:36.910
where I'd be reporting
directly to him.

15:38.910 --> 15:41.220
Thank you for letting me know.

15:41.260 --> 15:43.440
I will take it from here.

15:48.010 --> 15:50.050
So China's a no-go
for the U.N. tribunal.

15:50.100 --> 15:51.920
I just spoke to Chen yesterday.

15:51.970 --> 15:53.060
He seemed open to it.

15:53.100 --> 15:54.400
That was before

15:54.450 --> 15:55.986
Owen Callister made his
campaign announcement.

15:56.010 --> 15:57.946
They're waiting for
the dust to settle. What speech?

15:57.970 --> 16:00.320
How much dust could it
have kicked up?

16:00.370 --> 16:03.020
I guess you haven't seen
his poll numbers this morning.

16:03.070 --> 16:06.200
Look, maybe he appeals
to a fringe group,

16:06.240 --> 16:08.770
but he can't possibly
get a majority.

16:08.810 --> 16:11.160
Poland, Hungary, Russia.
Why not here?

16:11.200 --> 16:12.550
He convinces just enough voters

16:12.600 --> 16:14.470
that he's the savior
of the working class.

16:14.510 --> 16:17.910
So Callister comes out as
the dark knight, and that's it?

16:17.950 --> 16:20.340
We let Myanmar go unpunished?

16:22.000 --> 16:23.960
Well, there are other ways

16:24.000 --> 16:25.780
of getting
the world's attention.

16:26.830 --> 16:28.870
I'm listening.

16:28.920 --> 16:32.570
So far, our reports have talked

16:32.620 --> 16:35.750
about killings and atrocities.

16:36.750 --> 16:38.540
Let's call it what it is.

16:38.580 --> 16:40.490
Genocide.

16:42.890 --> 16:46.110
We couldn't even call Rwanda
genocide

16:46.150 --> 16:48.240
at the time. Yeah, but that's been
revised now.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.110
That could help us.

16:53.420 --> 16:56.860
And it sends a message
to Callister, too.

16:56.900 --> 16:59.380
We don't target minorities here,

16:59.430 --> 17:01.446
and we don't tolerate
other countries murdering them.

17:01.470 --> 17:03.210
Exactly.

17:03.260 --> 17:05.170
I'm gonna bring it
to the president.

17:05.210 --> 17:06.560
Thank you, Peter.

17:06.609 --> 17:08.609
I really... appreciate it.
Thank you, ma'am.

17:09.869 --> 17:12.260
I waited in a stupidly long line

17:12.310 --> 17:14.660
for what's supposed
to be the next Cronut.

17:14.700 --> 17:15.660
Uh, Mike Barnow, ma'am.

17:15.700 --> 17:16.700
Thanks, Blake.

17:16.750 --> 17:18.400
This is to keep you

17:18.440 --> 17:21.010
off-line for the next two
days, possibly the week.

17:21.060 --> 17:22.670
The article came out?

17:22.710 --> 17:24.020
Drops within the hour.

17:24.060 --> 17:26.099
Stay inside, don't look
at any memes or tweets,

17:26.150 --> 17:27.319
and for God's sake,

17:27.369 --> 17:28.540
don't read it.

17:28.590 --> 17:30.540
Why would I do that?

17:39.770 --> 17:42.290
Hey, Richard, can you reschedule
my lunch today?

17:42.340 --> 17:43.510
Something came up.

17:43.560 --> 17:44.860
Sure thing, Dr. McCord.

17:44.910 --> 17:46.910
Thanks.

17:53.480 --> 17:55.870
Henry.
Isabelle.

17:55.920 --> 17:58.050
So good to see you. You, too.

17:58.090 --> 17:59.700
How long has it been?

17:59.750 --> 18:01.140
Oh, gosh, uh,

18:01.180 --> 18:04.140
Elizabeth's last birthday dinner?
Oh.

18:04.190 --> 18:05.580
God, I'm the worst.

18:05.620 --> 18:06.940
No, I think we hold that honor...

18:06.970 --> 18:08.296
I mean, we keep talking
about seeing you

18:08.320 --> 18:10.840
and then there's always... Oh, I-I know.

18:10.890 --> 18:13.110
Work is so crazy.
I've been buying this house

18:13.150 --> 18:15.330
up in Maryland.
Oh, uh, well, that's great.

18:15.370 --> 18:17.460
Yeah, it's no horse farm
in Virginia.

18:17.500 --> 18:18.850
But you got to retire somewhere.

18:18.900 --> 18:20.550
Listen, by the time
we get all three kids

18:20.590 --> 18:22.876
through college, I don't know
if we're retiring with a farm.

18:22.900 --> 18:24.510
Oh, you know what?

18:24.550 --> 18:26.560
Just coffee, thank you.

18:27.950 --> 18:30.040
Somehow I think you two

18:30.080 --> 18:32.300
are on to bigger things
before you're done.

18:32.340 --> 18:34.430
Well, we're hoping
to stay in government.

18:34.480 --> 18:36.480
Mm-hmm.
But, um...

18:36.520 --> 18:38.350
articles like the one
that came out today

18:38.390 --> 18:39.610
don't exactly help.

18:41.700 --> 18:43.270
Thank you.

18:46.920 --> 18:50.360
I almost called Bess
as soon as I read it.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.760
She doesn't know I'm here. Oh.

18:54.980 --> 18:56.370
Listen, I've got to ask you.

18:56.410 --> 18:58.126
Do you know anyone from
your time together at CIA

18:58.150 --> 18:59.370
who would have done this?

18:59.420 --> 19:01.900
Someone who wants to
take Elizabeth down?

19:01.940 --> 19:04.070
You know, people knew
Bess was my friend.

19:04.120 --> 19:06.640
They didn't talk about
this stuff around me.

19:07.680 --> 19:10.250
You never heard rumors?

19:10.300 --> 19:11.990
Personally? No.

19:12.040 --> 19:13.950
Sometimes the Company

19:13.990 --> 19:17.040
is like high school
with encryption.

19:17.080 --> 19:20.310
Somebody wanted to look
important to a reporter,

19:20.350 --> 19:22.130
at some dinner party,
Elizabeth is right

19:22.180 --> 19:23.960
to let it evaporate.

19:24.000 --> 19:26.750
Yeah.

19:26.790 --> 19:29.010
Our kids read about this.

19:30.970 --> 19:33.190
Henry, you know
there's nothing to it, right?

19:33.230 --> 19:35.190
People used to call them
"the Honor Twins."

19:36.230 --> 19:38.110
Elizabeth and Conrad.

19:38.150 --> 19:39.460
Yeah, not a great reflection

19:39.500 --> 19:41.850
on the rest of us,
but, yeah, there it is.

19:43.290 --> 19:45.240
Hmm.

19:47.330 --> 19:48.940
So...

19:48.990 --> 19:52.030
I think I know the
source of the story.

19:53.080 --> 19:55.990
The one we're not talking about?

19:56.040 --> 19:58.040
I reached out to Isabelle

19:58.080 --> 19:59.130
this afternoon.Henry.

19:59.170 --> 20:00.570
I just wanted to get
her take on it.

20:02.520 --> 20:04.130
How is that ignoring it?

20:04.180 --> 20:07.050
She completely denied
ever hearing the rumors.

20:07.090 --> 20:09.220
You told me that you two
used to joke about it.

20:10.620 --> 20:13.010
So you think
Isabelle's the source?

20:13.050 --> 20:15.230
Why would she lie
about the rumors? I...

20:15.270 --> 20:16.800
I-I don't even know
what to say, I...

20:16.840 --> 20:18.800
Look, I don't want to
be right, but if she

20:18.840 --> 20:21.150
had something to do with it,
maybe we could, I don't know,

20:21.190 --> 20:23.240
could ask her to... She's not gonna
admit to it

20:23.280 --> 20:25.590
if she did do it.

20:26.940 --> 20:29.290
It doesn't make any sense.

20:29.330 --> 20:32.550
I think she's resentful
of your success.

20:32.600 --> 20:35.120
You never know how
that's gonna affect people.

20:38.080 --> 20:40.210
Look, I know we were
supposed to ignore it.

20:40.260 --> 20:41.690
But...

20:41.730 --> 20:42.690
after I read the article...

20:42.740 --> 20:44.610
Is it bad?

20:44.650 --> 20:47.000
Uh, it's all...
"alleged"

20:47.040 --> 20:49.740
and...
"rumored."

20:49.790 --> 20:53.530
So, as long as there's
no evidence to back it up...

20:53.570 --> 20:56.230
Are you-you asking me

20:56.270 --> 20:58.230
if I had an affair with Conrad? No.

20:58.270 --> 20:59.930
Of course not.

21:04.100 --> 21:06.460
See, this-this is how it works.

21:06.500 --> 21:08.020
This is the poison.

21:08.070 --> 21:10.550
I don't doubt you.

21:10.590 --> 21:12.006
But you were halfway
around the world,

21:12.030 --> 21:13.330
i-it was a rough time for us...

21:13.380 --> 21:15.510
Nothing happened!
I know.

21:15.550 --> 21:17.470
Ever. I...
I know.

21:20.860 --> 21:22.780
Yeah.

21:22.820 --> 21:24.730
Um...

21:24.780 --> 21:26.560
well, that's odd.

21:26.610 --> 21:29.000
Let him in, Matt, thank you.

21:30.520 --> 21:33.050
Governor of
Massachusetts is here.

21:34.610 --> 21:36.050
Governor Hayes.

21:36.090 --> 21:38.050
U-Uh, please come in.

21:38.100 --> 21:39.440
Thank you.

21:39.490 --> 21:41.620
I'm sorry to stop
in unannounced.

21:41.660 --> 21:43.750
Oh, it's... yeah, hi.

21:43.800 --> 21:45.100
I, um...

21:45.150 --> 21:48.540
was hoping to discuss
your future plans.

21:49.590 --> 21:51.590
Off the record.

21:59.730 --> 22:01.046
As a conservative governor
of a progressive state,

22:01.070 --> 22:03.250
I've come to appreciate
the values of my party

22:03.290 --> 22:04.730
that bring people together:

22:04.770 --> 22:08.390
an equal love of liberty
and the rule of law,

22:08.430 --> 22:11.390
patriotism, personal
responsibility,

22:11.430 --> 22:13.300
merit, and honor.

22:13.350 --> 22:17.220
Those are admirable values.

22:17.260 --> 22:20.920
I don't believe Owen Callister
represents those values.

22:20.960 --> 22:23.100
I'm not the only member
of the party

22:23.140 --> 22:24.970
who found his remarks
yesterday hateful,

22:25.010 --> 22:26.970
divisive, fearmongering.

22:27.010 --> 22:29.630
Well, he is polling pretty well.

22:29.670 --> 22:32.760
Well, with a certain section
of the American people.

22:32.800 --> 22:35.240
We believe another candidate

22:35.280 --> 22:38.420
can bring those people
back to the center.

22:38.460 --> 22:40.940
Elizabeth,

22:40.980 --> 22:43.940
I'm here tonight to ask you
to seek the nomination

22:43.990 --> 22:47.380
of the Republican Party
for president.

22:50.390 --> 22:53.210
Wow. That's...

22:57.350 --> 23:00.960
Can I-I speak frankly, John?

23:01.000 --> 23:03.010
Please.

23:06.010 --> 23:08.970
I-I work for a president

23:09.010 --> 23:10.800
who turned his back
on both parties.

23:10.840 --> 23:12.020
Why come to me?

23:12.060 --> 23:14.450
Because you're a
worthy candidate.

23:14.500 --> 23:16.110
Well, I appreciate that.

23:16.150 --> 23:19.110
I do. But...

23:19.150 --> 23:21.240
I got to tell you,

23:21.290 --> 23:24.550
when I look at your party's
current platform,

23:24.590 --> 23:27.200
I-I...

23:27.250 --> 23:29.770
I mean, I-I'm about to host

23:29.820 --> 23:31.990
a global conference
on climate change,

23:32.040 --> 23:36.080
and your party can't even agree
that climate is changing.

23:37.130 --> 23:39.090
We need to evolve.

23:39.130 --> 23:42.090
We'd see your candidacy
as an opportunity to do that

23:42.130 --> 23:44.480
and, at the same time,
come back to the party

23:44.530 --> 23:47.050
of Teddy Roosevelt
and Dwight Eisenhower.

23:47.090 --> 23:51.580
A square deal and a
strong national defense.

23:51.620 --> 23:54.360
I think you fit that platform.

23:54.410 --> 23:56.150
And it's a platform we believe

23:56.190 --> 23:59.150
the majority of Americans
will vote for.

23:59.190 --> 24:01.540
Well, that's inspiring.

24:01.590 --> 24:03.980
And... flattering.

24:05.020 --> 24:07.420
But if you're so alarmed by

24:07.460 --> 24:09.420
Owen Callister,
why not denounce him?

24:09.460 --> 24:11.250
Where are the public statements?

24:11.290 --> 24:14.430
We don't want to alienate the
people Callister's talking to.

24:14.470 --> 24:16.430
We want to reach them.

24:16.470 --> 24:20.040
We think we can do that
with you.

24:21.080 --> 24:22.910
Well, Governor,

24:22.960 --> 24:24.260
you, uh...

24:24.300 --> 24:27.310
you have given me
a lot to think about.

24:29.310 --> 24:30.570
Thank you.

24:30.620 --> 24:31.920
My pleasure.

24:31.960 --> 24:33.580
Hope you'll say yes.

24:33.620 --> 24:35.450
What is there to think about?!

24:35.490 --> 24:38.100
For starters, the fact that
she's aligned with a president

24:38.140 --> 24:39.280
who won as an Independent.

24:39.320 --> 24:40.890
For the first time in history.

24:40.930 --> 24:43.800
The chances of that happening
a second time are about the same

24:43.850 --> 24:45.386
as my son's chances
of getting into Harvard.

24:45.410 --> 24:47.550
Well, the governor
makes one good point:

24:47.590 --> 24:50.460
if I join the GOP ticket now,

24:50.510 --> 24:52.616
we have a better chance
of knocking Callister out early.

24:52.640 --> 24:55.160
What if the governor represents
a small faction of the party

24:55.210 --> 24:56.860
and you don't win broad support?

24:56.900 --> 24:58.096
And then we're dead
in New Hampshire.

24:58.120 --> 24:59.406
Have you forgotten
who you're working for?

24:59.430 --> 25:01.990
Um, Elizabeth schooled
America about nationalism,

25:02.040 --> 25:04.780
and her, and her popularity
went up five points.

25:04.820 --> 25:07.300
This country's totally ready
to be spanked by Hot Mom.

25:10.000 --> 25:11.530
What do youthink?

25:13.830 --> 25:18.320
I think that I do line up
with some GOP policy positions.

25:18.360 --> 25:22.230
I think privatization

25:22.280 --> 25:24.840
is sometimes more efficient

25:24.890 --> 25:26.190
than government bureaucracy,

25:26.240 --> 25:28.930
and I'm all for
a strong military.

25:28.980 --> 25:31.460
And I think...

25:31.500 --> 25:34.160
we do all win when
the government steps back

25:34.200 --> 25:35.590
and allows responsible

25:35.640 --> 25:36.990
businesses to thrive.

25:37.030 --> 25:38.640
But I don't think that

25:38.680 --> 25:40.900
that means that corporations
should pay a lower tax rate

25:40.950 --> 25:42.030
than schoolteachers.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.446
Of course not.
You can... There's always

25:43.470 --> 25:44.650
a way to frame it.

25:44.690 --> 25:48.350
What happens when
I make wealth disparity

25:48.390 --> 25:49.480
my key issue?

25:49.520 --> 25:50.780
Or...

25:50.830 --> 25:55.180
declare that the days
of undermining democracy

25:55.220 --> 25:57.350
by gerrymandering are over?

25:57.400 --> 25:59.490
You will trade horses
like every other politician.

25:59.530 --> 26:00.920
She's not every
other politician.

26:00.970 --> 26:04.620
One bonus: I make this call
tomorrow, I am pretty sure

26:04.670 --> 26:06.710
this whole affair story
goes away a lot faster.

26:06.760 --> 26:08.630
Okay, that...

26:08.670 --> 26:12.200
is exactly the kind of political
gamesmanship that I hate.

26:12.240 --> 26:15.420
I know that both parties do it.

26:15.460 --> 26:18.070
But the GOP has
a much darker history

26:18.110 --> 26:21.550
of playing up wedge issues
like same-sex marriage

26:21.600 --> 26:23.030
just to fire up voters.

26:23.080 --> 26:25.770
When I went to Camp David
to think about the candidate

26:25.820 --> 26:29.390
I want to be, none of that
was on the list.

26:29.430 --> 26:31.106
Seems like you know your way
forward on this, ma'am.

26:31.130 --> 26:32.690
Let's not make any
decisions tonight.

26:32.740 --> 26:34.740
Yeah.

26:37.000 --> 26:39.310
Let me, let me just,
let me just say this:

26:39.350 --> 26:43.100
no one... gets to
shape this country

26:43.140 --> 26:46.140
by being the noble
candidate who lost.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.140
We get past the primary

26:48.190 --> 26:51.280
and get the GOP
machine behind us?

26:51.320 --> 26:53.800
Guarantee we win this thing.

27:02.640 --> 27:04.420
Hey, is anyone gonna
say anything?

27:04.460 --> 27:06.926
Like what? "Congratulations on
your affair with the president"?

27:06.950 --> 27:08.820
Wait. We don't really
think it happened, do we?

27:08.860 --> 27:10.560
I think it's none
of our business, and, no,

27:10.600 --> 27:12.470
I don't think it happened.

27:14.650 --> 27:16.390
Did you see Carrot Top's tweet?

27:16.430 --> 27:17.560
You follow Carrot Top?

27:17.610 --> 27:19.870
Good morning. Good morning.
Ma'am.

27:19.920 --> 27:22.740
Morning. Good morning.

27:22.790 --> 27:25.140
Here's your schedule,
and muffin's on your desk.

27:25.180 --> 27:26.880
Okay.

27:26.920 --> 27:30.100
Can I see you
in my office, Nina?

27:30.140 --> 27:31.270
Thank you.

27:33.150 --> 27:37.890
Listen, Kat shared with me
your concerns about working

27:37.930 --> 27:39.460
with Deputy Secretary Bailey.

27:39.500 --> 27:41.760
Oh, gosh, it's really not
that big of a deal.

27:41.810 --> 27:43.030
It-it is,

27:43.070 --> 27:47.030
and-and I'm grateful
that you brought it to me.

27:47.070 --> 27:50.860
Um... look, I'm, I'm happy
to transfer you

27:50.900 --> 27:53.380
wherever you want to go,

27:53.430 --> 27:56.390
but for the sake
of everyone else working

27:56.430 --> 28:01.350
with the deputy secretary,
I wonder if you would tell me

28:01.390 --> 28:03.000
a little bit more
about what you know.

28:05.260 --> 28:07.456
Well, I don't, I don't really
want to get anybody in trouble

28:07.480 --> 28:08.490
just based on gossip.

28:08.530 --> 28:10.310
Oh.

28:10.360 --> 28:12.840
Well, trust me,
I can appreciate that.

28:14.010 --> 28:15.620
But I'm trying to gather

28:15.670 --> 28:18.760
any information I can to pass it

28:18.800 --> 28:20.800
to the Office of Civil Rights
for review.

28:20.850 --> 28:24.630
Well, from what I've read,
um, most of those incidents

28:24.680 --> 28:26.550
have already gone to OCR.

28:27.550 --> 28:30.900
Can I ask where,
where you read this?

28:31.940 --> 28:34.160
Uh...

28:34.210 --> 28:35.470
oh, gosh.

28:35.510 --> 28:36.990
Um, okay.

28:37.040 --> 28:40.210
There's... a document

28:40.260 --> 28:42.610
that goes around between
women federal employees.

28:42.650 --> 28:45.090
Mostly lower level.

28:45.130 --> 28:49.530
Just a private thing,
warning each other of

28:49.570 --> 28:52.790
which men to avoid
being alone with.

28:52.830 --> 28:56.620
And the deputy secretary
is in it?

28:56.660 --> 28:57.800
Yeah, um,

28:57.840 --> 28:59.840
mostly...

28:59.880 --> 29:02.500
groping and lunging

29:02.540 --> 29:04.540
and some weird comments.

29:07.980 --> 29:11.200
If I assure you that
I will protect the identities

29:11.240 --> 29:15.420
of the accusers,
would you be willing

29:15.470 --> 29:17.600
to share that document with me?

29:22.470 --> 29:24.430
Thank you.

29:30.440 --> 29:34.400
For what it's worth,
the president isn't in it.

29:34.440 --> 29:36.140
And I'm really sorry

29:36.180 --> 29:38.270
about that article, ma'am.

29:48.150 --> 29:49.410
Isabelle.

29:51.200 --> 29:53.070
Bess, oh, my God.

29:53.110 --> 29:55.770
How good to see you.

29:55.810 --> 29:57.720
How have you been?

29:57.770 --> 30:00.210
A little rocky lately.

30:00.250 --> 30:03.730
Did you repeat any of the rumors
about Conrad and me?

30:03.770 --> 30:05.080
What, you think I'mthe source?

30:05.120 --> 30:06.650
Henry said he talked to you.

30:06.690 --> 30:09.480
Why, why would you say
you hadn't heard anything?

30:09.520 --> 30:10.610
He showed up, he...

30:10.650 --> 30:13.570
You know what, can
we get in the car?

30:13.610 --> 30:16.050
I-I'm freezing.Sure.

30:17.270 --> 30:20.790
Henry...

30:20.840 --> 30:22.270
he showed up out of nowhere.

30:22.310 --> 30:23.750
He's obviously

30:23.790 --> 30:26.230
stirred up from reading about

30:26.280 --> 30:28.490
his wife sleeping with her boss.

30:28.540 --> 30:31.630
When your friend's husband

30:31.670 --> 30:35.680
asks you if it's true,
you don't feed the fire.

30:39.070 --> 30:42.120
This whole thing... Yeah.

30:42.160 --> 30:46.640
Do you have any idea
who it could've been?

30:46.690 --> 30:49.600
I mean, it could've been
a lot of people, Bess.

30:49.650 --> 30:52.690
Weren't thatmany
people out to get me.

30:52.740 --> 30:53.960
Maybe not out to get you,

30:54.000 --> 30:56.780
but if they were asked?
They all had eyes.

30:56.830 --> 30:58.026
Whether anything
happened or not,

30:58.050 --> 30:59.740
he clearly favored you.

30:59.790 --> 31:01.140
Wait...

31:01.180 --> 31:03.090
Look, I know you
didn't cross any lines.

31:03.140 --> 31:04.986
I-I mean, I don't even think
there's anything wrong

31:05.010 --> 31:06.270
with how you benefited from it.

31:06.320 --> 31:08.670
Uh... Wow.

31:08.710 --> 31:11.490
So you think that I... No. I'm-I'm not...

31:11.540 --> 31:13.710
used Conrad... No, I'm not saying
you didn't earn

31:13.760 --> 31:16.850
everything that you've achieved,
and believe me, I will be

31:16.890 --> 31:18.150
first in line to vote for you.

31:18.200 --> 31:20.070
I know it's totally
unfair to you, but

31:20.110 --> 31:22.370
it's not hard for people who
saw your dynamic with Conrad

31:22.420 --> 31:25.730
to think there could have been
something to those rumors.

31:42.660 --> 31:44.960
The foreign aid bill
before the Senate

31:45.010 --> 31:47.230
this morning
generated heated debate.

31:47.270 --> 31:50.050
I am absolutely opposed to
increasing our foreign spending,

31:50.100 --> 31:53.060
particularly at a time
when the chief diplomat

31:53.100 --> 31:55.410
representing the United States
to the rest of the world,

31:55.450 --> 31:57.280
Elizabeth McCord, brings such

31:57.320 --> 31:59.280
a shameful example
of moral turpitude

31:59.320 --> 32:01.370
and corruption...

32:04.500 --> 32:06.330
Hey, Jace.

32:08.030 --> 32:12.690
I was hoping for a sit-down
with Secretary McCord

32:12.730 --> 32:14.300
sooner than later.

32:14.340 --> 32:16.226
There are a few initiatives
I'd like to go over with her.

32:16.250 --> 32:17.520
Well, there's another matter

32:17.560 --> 32:20.560
we need to discuss
first, Deputy Secretary.

32:20.610 --> 32:22.830
Hey. Let's keep
it Steven,

32:22.870 --> 32:25.000
at least until I'm out
of the bullpen.

32:27.350 --> 32:29.310
Uh, if you could take
a look at this.

32:29.350 --> 32:30.920
Mm-hmm.

32:30.970 --> 32:32.970
What...?

32:34.660 --> 32:36.620
You want to tell me
what this is?

32:36.670 --> 32:38.190
It's an anonymous document

32:38.230 --> 32:40.166
maintained by female employees
of the federal government

32:40.190 --> 32:43.110
warning each other of
other employees who have

32:43.150 --> 32:45.200
made them feel unsafe.

32:52.640 --> 32:54.600
Here we go.

32:54.640 --> 32:58.080
Deputy Secretary, you should
know that Secretary McCord and I

32:58.120 --> 33:01.000
take these allegations
very seriously.

33:01.040 --> 33:02.820
I suggest you do so as well.

33:02.870 --> 33:05.700
And, uh, you want to hear
my side of the story,

33:05.740 --> 33:08.520
or have you done away
with due process?

33:08.570 --> 33:11.700
Oh, all of these allegations
will be investigated fully

33:11.740 --> 33:14.360
if you decide to
take this position.

33:14.400 --> 33:16.710
What are you implying?

33:16.750 --> 33:18.930
I am openly informing you

33:18.970 --> 33:21.280
that if an investigation
confirms any of the actions

33:21.320 --> 33:23.280
as described in this document,

33:23.320 --> 33:25.980
then you will not become
Acting Secretary of State.

33:26.020 --> 33:28.370
Furthermore,
those determinations

33:28.410 --> 33:31.070
will most likely follow you

33:31.110 --> 33:34.590
in your next career, so...

33:34.640 --> 33:38.250
you may want to think carefully
about your next move.

33:40.640 --> 33:43.910
You know, I get
that the rules have changed.

33:43.950 --> 33:47.390
But you need
to look at my record.

33:47.430 --> 33:49.390
No one has been
a bigger champion of women

33:49.430 --> 33:50.570
in this department.

33:50.610 --> 33:52.480
And I have taken bullets

33:52.520 --> 33:54.660
for this country,
and now you're telling me

33:54.700 --> 33:57.440
that you're gonna run me
out of town on... at dawn

33:57.490 --> 33:59.970
because a few women have
no sense of humor?

34:00.010 --> 34:01.790
It's a shocking
violation, isn't it?

34:01.840 --> 34:06.450
To be confronted
by something so unwelcome

34:06.500 --> 34:09.409
and disempowering at work?

34:09.449 --> 34:11.800
I'm pretty sure

34:11.850 --> 34:15.290
every woman in this document
knows exactly how you feel.

34:18.330 --> 34:21.290
Sir, I'd like to ask
if we can turn up the heat

34:21.340 --> 34:24.600
and call the Myanmar attack
against the Rohingya people

34:24.639 --> 34:26.600
what it is: genocide.

34:26.650 --> 34:29.469
I think I know the answer
to this, but why now?

34:29.520 --> 34:32.260
Because Myanmar getting away
with turning tanks

34:32.300 --> 34:34.480
on its own people
makes it a lot easier

34:34.520 --> 34:38.350
for the next regime
to give it a try.

34:38.400 --> 34:39.699
Because we should have

34:39.750 --> 34:43.489
moved on it
when we had the chance.

34:43.530 --> 34:45.659
All good points.

34:45.710 --> 34:50.500
But genocide, once proven,

34:50.540 --> 34:54.850
brings a legal obligation
to prevent and punish.

34:54.889 --> 34:56.500
If we intervene
in one situation,

34:56.550 --> 34:58.850
there are dozens of others
all over the world

34:58.900 --> 35:01.160
that clamor
for the same recognition. I know.

35:01.200 --> 35:03.040
Yeah, it's the same thinking
that made us avoid

35:03.070 --> 35:04.290
intervening in Rwanda.

35:04.340 --> 35:06.340
There are other terms
you can use

35:06.380 --> 35:09.120
that don't bring the same burden
of intervention

35:09.170 --> 35:11.820
but would still shame
the Chinese for sitting it out.

35:11.860 --> 35:14.220
That saves you from starting
a mess with China

35:14.260 --> 35:17.220
that I would rather
you didn't inherit from me.

35:17.260 --> 35:19.000
It's no guarantee

35:19.050 --> 35:23.490
that I'm gonna inherit
anything from you, sir.

35:23.530 --> 35:25.010
Don't tell me you're letting

35:25.050 --> 35:27.010
that ridiculous article
get to you.

35:29.360 --> 35:31.840
It's my family
I'm worried about.

35:33.890 --> 35:35.540
Well, I'm willing
to make a statement

35:35.580 --> 35:37.760
about the damn thing
if it'll help. No,

35:37.800 --> 35:38.940
thank you, sir.

35:38.980 --> 35:40.460
But you decided
to stay out of it,

35:40.500 --> 35:42.200
and I'm gonna follow your lead.

35:42.240 --> 35:45.250
I hope Lydia isn't too upset?

35:47.810 --> 35:50.080
One thing we learned
about this job is that you need

35:50.120 --> 35:51.760
to keep yourself separate
from the office.

35:52.600 --> 35:55.390
They are two different things.

35:55.430 --> 35:57.350
Conrad, do you think...?

35:58.910 --> 36:02.520
When we were at CIA,
did you favor me?

36:04.480 --> 36:06.140
Of course.

36:08.360 --> 36:11.230
You were smart, diligent,

36:11.270 --> 36:13.400
and you knew how to
think for yourself.

36:13.450 --> 36:17.840
What kind of boss would I be
if I didn't favor that?

36:20.110 --> 36:22.110
Perfect. Thanks, Kayla.

36:22.150 --> 36:23.980
I'll circle back ASAP.

36:24.020 --> 36:26.086
If that's a masseuse, can you
see if she'll do campaign stops?

36:26.110 --> 36:27.486
What makes you think
I'm booking a masseuse?

36:27.510 --> 36:28.990
You said her name was Kayla.

36:29.030 --> 36:30.160
Hey.

36:30.200 --> 36:31.470
Sorry I'm late.

36:31.510 --> 36:32.820
Hey, you want my beer?

36:32.860 --> 36:34.470
Suck-up. Uh, no, um, I'm fine.

36:34.510 --> 36:36.820
Look, I've been thinking
about the GOP offer...

36:36.860 --> 36:39.016
Before you finish that thought,
I just got off the phone

36:39.040 --> 36:41.130
with the Democratic Party
chairman's office.

36:41.170 --> 36:42.560
They want to talk. What?

36:42.610 --> 36:44.410
So we can hear what
the other side has to say.

36:44.440 --> 36:45.700
You greenhorn idiot.

36:45.740 --> 36:47.440
Mike. You just gave
Callister every reason

36:47.480 --> 36:49.376
to call her a superficial
party hopper. I just gave a candidate

36:49.400 --> 36:51.570
the opportunity to
consider her options. Guys, enough.

36:51.620 --> 36:53.970
Enough.

36:54.010 --> 36:57.360
This whole routine
between the two of you,

36:57.410 --> 37:00.280
undercutting,
the jockeying for position,

37:00.320 --> 37:02.280
this has got to stop.

37:02.320 --> 37:04.410
This is exactly what
George Washington hated

37:04.460 --> 37:05.760
about a two-party system.

37:05.800 --> 37:07.680
Two sides trying
to dominate each other.

37:07.720 --> 37:09.136
What does he know?
He had wooden teeth.

37:09.160 --> 37:10.460
He was right.

37:10.510 --> 37:12.120
And so is Jay, by the way.

37:12.160 --> 37:15.770
My political identity
is tied to Conrad's.

37:15.810 --> 37:17.770
I'm an independent.

37:17.820 --> 37:20.210
It's who I am,
and it's how I'm gonna run.

37:20.250 --> 37:22.910
I'm gonna call Governor Hayes,

37:22.950 --> 37:25.130
tell him we're
declining his offer.

37:25.170 --> 37:27.610
Either of you have
a problem with that?

37:27.650 --> 37:29.920
No, ma'am.
Good.

37:29.960 --> 37:31.806
I've also accepted
an interview tomorrow morning

37:31.830 --> 37:35.270
where I'm gonna put
these affair rumors to rest,

37:35.310 --> 37:36.570
among other things.

37:36.620 --> 37:38.296
Love it. Can we go
over some talking points?

37:38.320 --> 37:40.320
I don't need talking points.

37:40.360 --> 37:42.060
I was there.

37:45.840 --> 37:48.590
Guys, this is gonna be
a long, hard road,

37:48.630 --> 37:50.810
but it's the road
I want to be on.

37:50.850 --> 37:52.720
So you either

37:52.760 --> 37:57.160
get on it with me
or get out of the way. Okay?

37:58.200 --> 37:59.640
Great.

37:59.680 --> 38:01.730
Thank you.

38:11.220 --> 38:12.830
Oh, my God.

38:14.220 --> 38:15.870
Hey, did you see
Bailey's resignation?

38:15.920 --> 38:18.376
Are you kidding? I killed trees
and printed it out for everyone.

38:18.400 --> 38:19.660
Hey, it's pretty decent, right?

38:19.700 --> 38:21.296
Wait, are we talking
Bailey's resignation?

38:21.320 --> 38:22.580
So, you think he wrote it?

38:22.620 --> 38:25.670
"I regret the part
I played in a system

38:25.710 --> 38:28.840
designed to silence and dominate
half the world's population."

38:28.890 --> 38:30.086
He didn't write it.[laughs]: No.

38:30.110 --> 38:31.590
But I love whoever
got him to sign it.

38:31.630 --> 38:32.850
I know. Uh, good morning.

38:32.890 --> 38:33.956
Hey, Nina,
can I see you for a minute?

38:33.980 --> 38:36.070
Sure.

38:36.110 --> 38:38.030
And, uh, the secretary's
interview might go long.

38:38.070 --> 38:40.226
You were able to move the meet
and greet with the new FSOs?

38:40.250 --> 38:41.680
Yes, to Thursday.Good.

38:41.730 --> 38:45.250
So, do we know
who wrote that memo?

38:45.300 --> 38:49.430
I think the deputy secretary
saw the error of his ways.

38:49.470 --> 38:52.220
What? It could happen.

38:53.430 --> 38:55.870
Undersecretary Thompson.

38:55.910 --> 38:57.870
Yes. This is Nina Cummings.

38:57.920 --> 38:59.700
She'll be your new
administrative assistant.

38:59.740 --> 39:02.180
And, Nina, Undersecretary
Thompson will be stepping in

39:02.230 --> 39:05.490
as acting secretary
once we begin the transition.

39:05.530 --> 39:08.670
It's an honor.
I-I so admire your work

39:08.710 --> 39:10.736
with the Bureau
of African Affairs. Thank you, Nina.

39:10.760 --> 39:12.580
I look forward
to working with you. Me, too.

39:12.630 --> 39:15.330
Oh, that reminds me, um,
OMB approved a line item

39:15.370 --> 39:17.410
for tampons in the bathrooms.

39:17.460 --> 39:18.590
Nina's idea.Hey.

39:18.630 --> 39:20.330
Look at that.Oh.

39:20.370 --> 39:21.810
Policy in action.

39:21.850 --> 39:23.160
Yes. That's right.

39:23.200 --> 39:24.470
What else can we get?

39:24.510 --> 39:26.420
Um, equal pay.Yes.

39:27.730 --> 39:31.080
In five, four, three...

39:33.340 --> 39:36.960
Secretary McCord,
I'm gonna get right to it.

39:37.000 --> 39:39.000
Are you running for president

39:39.040 --> 39:40.480
in the next election?

39:40.520 --> 39:42.400
Well, right now I'm pretty busy

39:42.440 --> 39:45.220
representing our country
to the rest of the world.

39:45.270 --> 39:47.970
I want to get to your work
as Secretary of State,

39:48.010 --> 39:50.320
but first
let's go back to your time

39:50.360 --> 39:52.100
at the CIA.

39:52.140 --> 39:54.800
Uh, you were
an intelligence analyst

39:54.840 --> 39:57.450
working with
Conrad Dalton in Iraq?

39:57.500 --> 39:58.760
Yes, that's right.

39:58.800 --> 40:03.030
You worked closely
with President Dalton.

40:03.070 --> 40:04.370
I was a member

40:04.420 --> 40:06.160
of an incredible team.

40:06.200 --> 40:09.860
There was a great deal
of mutual respect.

40:09.900 --> 40:12.470
There have been
rumors lately, uh,

40:12.510 --> 40:15.120
that your relationship
with President Dalton

40:15.170 --> 40:18.480
was a more intimate one
during those years?

40:18.520 --> 40:20.390
Those rumors are not true,

40:20.430 --> 40:22.870
and the people spreading them
are the same people

40:22.910 --> 40:24.660
who are trying
to distract Americans

40:24.700 --> 40:27.310
from the real threats we face.

40:27.350 --> 40:31.050
Like the rise of hatred
and intolerance.

40:31.100 --> 40:33.710
These people want us to
be scared and suspicious

40:33.750 --> 40:37.100
of anyone who looks, speaks,

40:37.150 --> 40:40.760
prays differently
than people we know.

40:40.800 --> 40:44.810
Because when we're scared,
that's when they take power.

40:44.850 --> 40:48.510
This is happening
all over the world.

40:48.550 --> 40:52.120
Last year, Myanmar unleashed
a campaign of ethnic cleansing

40:52.160 --> 40:56.080
on an entire population
of Muslim citizens

40:56.120 --> 40:59.430
in retaliation against a
handful of Muslim dissidents.

40:59.470 --> 41:02.210
And right now
they're getting away with it.

41:02.260 --> 41:06.310
It's the same hate and fear
that drove extremists

41:06.350 --> 41:09.790
to attack the White House
over an immigration policy.

41:09.830 --> 41:13.530
And it's the same hate
infecting every line

41:13.570 --> 41:16.530
of Senator Callister's
campaign announcement.

41:16.580 --> 41:18.060
You made a speech

41:18.100 --> 41:19.930
several months ago, uh,

41:19.970 --> 41:25.150
calling nationalism the greatest
threat to humankind.

41:25.190 --> 41:27.150
I did,

41:27.200 --> 41:31.420
but what's happening now
is even more scary.

41:31.460 --> 41:36.210
Extremists aren't just attacking
the White House from outside,

41:36.250 --> 41:38.990
they're trying to move into it.

41:39.030 --> 41:42.170
If we vote hatred
into our highest office,

41:42.210 --> 41:44.780
I don't think we survive that.
Not intact.

41:44.820 --> 41:45.950
What would you say

41:46.000 --> 41:47.300
to the many Americans

41:47.350 --> 41:51.310
who support
Senator Callister's message?

41:51.350 --> 41:54.790
De Tocqueville called
our early democracy

41:54.830 --> 41:57.620
"the great experiment."

41:57.660 --> 42:03.150
And I love that because it
reminds me how fragile we are.

42:03.190 --> 42:05.320
Every generation

42:05.360 --> 42:09.630
gets to choose whether or not
this experiment continues.

42:09.670 --> 42:13.290
That means not giving in
to the weaknesses

42:13.330 --> 42:16.160
that make us fragile as people
and as a country,

42:16.200 --> 42:19.120
not listening
to those who tell us

42:19.160 --> 42:22.160
to blame others
when we feel shut out.

42:22.210 --> 42:26.040
And that can be
such a tempting message,

42:26.080 --> 42:28.390
especially when you're down,

42:28.430 --> 42:30.870
but it's a false one
and a dark one.

42:30.910 --> 42:33.570
All I can say is,

42:33.610 --> 42:36.570
however I continue
to serve our country,

42:36.610 --> 42:40.270
I will never stop fighting
to save this great experiment.
