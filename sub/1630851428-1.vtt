WEBVTT

00:37.737 --> 00:41.274
Nam etsi ambulavero
in medio umbrae mortis,

00:41.374 --> 00:45.578
non timebo mala,
quoniam tu mecum es.

00:45.678 --> 00:51.051
Virga tua et baculus tuus
ipsa me consolata sunt.

00:51.117 --> 00:54.120
She was furious with me,
because if I had my law degree,

00:54.220 --> 00:56.523
I could have represented us.

00:56.589 --> 00:58.358
The jury ruled against me.

00:58.425 --> 01:01.027
I told my lawyer
I considered suicide.

01:01.094 --> 01:04.030
I drove home from Nyack,
and guess what?

01:04.097 --> 01:05.365
She had left me.

01:05.432 --> 01:07.567
I recall almost
a sigh of relief...

01:07.634 --> 01:10.070
Somehow it made a lasting
impression on her life.

01:10.136 --> 01:12.572
My first child
came easy enough.

01:12.639 --> 01:18.111
But with Patricia,
they had to open me up
under anesthesia.

01:18.211 --> 01:21.147
I've often thought that
perhaps the reason...

01:21.247 --> 01:23.316
I told them
when I got here,

01:23.416 --> 01:26.152
"Okay, I explored
the criminal lifestyle."

01:26.252 --> 01:28.988
But I was an altar boy,
for Christ's sake.

01:29.089 --> 01:34.160
Moltisanti is a religious name.
And still I'm fucked.

01:34.260 --> 01:38.998
I met death on Route 23,
not too far from here.

01:39.099 --> 01:42.235
But that was much later.

01:42.302 --> 01:47.173
Back in 1967,
the man wearing the hat
was my father.

01:47.273 --> 01:49.442
In those days,
he didn't have a son.

01:49.509 --> 01:51.744
Five dollars says
I spot him first.

01:51.811 --> 01:53.580
I don't got five dollars.

01:53.646 --> 01:55.915
Then you better win,
gagootz.  Huh?

01:57.150 --> 01:58.751
Uncle Dick, think fast.

01:58.818 --> 02:00.753
Oh, you want to fight, huh?

02:00.820 --> 02:04.624
The little fat kid
is my uncle, Tony. Soprano.

02:04.691 --> 02:05.658
You got nothing.

02:07.360 --> 02:10.997
Well, we call him
my uncle, by marriage.

02:12.665 --> 02:14.000
He choked me to death.

02:20.006 --> 02:22.142
There! Pay up.

02:22.208 --> 02:24.277
We have a winner,
ladies and gents.

02:24.344 --> 02:26.479
Huh?

02:26.546 --> 02:28.014
My grandfather
and his brother were with

02:28.114 --> 02:30.617
the DiMeo crime family
in Newark.

02:30.683 --> 02:32.485
My grandfather
was an associate,

02:32.552 --> 02:33.786
-but he stacked more  scharol...
-Pop!

02:33.853 --> 02:35.522
...than any of the made guys.

02:35.622 --> 02:37.557
Hey, there he is!

02:37.657 --> 02:40.160
Including
a Cadillac dealership.

02:42.896 --> 02:47.734
Cara mia, fammi presentare
mio figlio,  Richard Moltisanti.

02:47.834 --> 02:50.403
Everybody calls me Dickie.

02:52.906 --> 02:54.674
Welcome to America.

02:54.741 --> 02:56.009
Benvenuta.

03:01.080 --> 03:04.484
Most guys 65
go to Europe on vacation,
they come back with the gout.

03:04.551 --> 03:08.154
You come back with the winner,
Miss Provolone, 1967.

03:11.357 --> 03:14.761
Oh. Antonio Soprano.

03:16.429 --> 03:17.897
U picceri.

03:19.532 --> 03:21.768
After he murdered me,

03:21.868 --> 03:25.505
Tony gave my wife and baby
his pocket change.

03:25.572 --> 03:27.407
But that was much  later.

03:35.048 --> 03:37.617
E squisita.

03:37.717 --> 03:41.955
I'm embarrassed.
You're all such
great cooks over there.

03:43.756 --> 03:45.225
Can you translate for me?

03:45.291 --> 03:47.293
Forget it.
She understands enough.

04:01.140 --> 04:06.312
Giuseppina,
what does your family
do over there?

04:07.981 --> 04:09.082
Mio padre--

04:09.148 --> 04:11.150
The fascists killed
her old man.

04:11.251 --> 04:13.052
Her mother never recovered.

04:13.119 --> 04:14.721
Fuckin' Mussolini.

04:14.787 --> 04:17.090
I don't get it.
When I was a kid,
you and Vito Genovese

04:17.156 --> 04:18.424
always praised Mussolini.

04:18.491 --> 04:20.660
Let's not talk politics
at the table.

04:21.794 --> 04:23.730
But I'll tell you, Dick,

04:23.796 --> 04:26.266
it's paradise over there.

04:26.332 --> 04:29.168
On the one hand,
you can't believe the beauty.

04:29.269 --> 04:32.672
On the other hand,
they don't even have toilets.

04:32.772 --> 04:38.511
I told Giuseppina that
"you're gonna live the life
of a proud American lady.

04:38.611 --> 04:42.582
And I'm gonna have
my second set of children
with you."

04:42.649 --> 04:44.450
And they'll be deluged
with a life

04:44.517 --> 04:47.186
that they could never even
imagine over there.

04:47.287 --> 04:50.923
Like you were, Dick,
as a kid.

04:52.191 --> 04:54.294
These'll be your
brothers and sisters.

04:55.662 --> 04:59.799
So... Giuseppina
is your stepmother, Dickie.

05:04.370 --> 05:06.306
Yeah.

05:06.372 --> 05:08.508
-

05:40.640 --> 05:42.575
It wasn't me
who ripped you off!

05:42.675 --> 05:44.344
Oh, yeah? Oh, yeah?

05:44.410 --> 05:45.812
-Come on!
-

05:57.890 --> 05:59.058
Shit!
-Harold.

06:00.193 --> 06:01.594
All right, already.

06:01.694 --> 06:03.029
This punk ass snapper.

06:03.096 --> 06:05.865
Japped one of our runners,
took 600 bucks.

06:08.201 --> 06:09.669
I want a full bag tomorrow.

06:09.736 --> 06:11.671
Who the fuck are you?

06:11.738 --> 06:14.907
The guy who one time
put out somebody's eye
for talkin' to him like that.

06:19.178 --> 06:21.614
-You winded there,
Jesse Owens?
-

06:21.714 --> 06:23.449
I gotta quit smoking.

06:24.183 --> 06:26.252
I agree.

06:26.352 --> 06:28.554
Can't I get you
to switch to Newports?

06:53.913 --> 06:55.415
Hey, Harold.
My son here say

06:55.481 --> 06:57.483
he gonna be Hank Aaron
when he grown up.

06:57.583 --> 06:59.419
I'm gonna hit
318 like him.

06:59.485 --> 07:02.555
Hmm. 318,
your lucky number, boy,
play it.

07:02.622 --> 07:04.290
Yeah. Numbers
is the only chance

07:04.390 --> 07:05.992
Black folks got
to get out of
this sinkhole city.

07:06.092 --> 07:07.560
How does that work, anyway?

07:07.627 --> 07:09.495
Well, you pick out
three numbers,

07:09.595 --> 07:10.963
like for you, 3-1-8.

07:11.063 --> 07:12.331
You bet a quarter,

07:12.432 --> 07:13.833
and if your numbers
come on at the racetrack,

07:13.933 --> 07:17.336
then you win
$125 for a quarter.

07:17.437 --> 07:18.571
-For a quarter?
-Mmm.

07:18.638 --> 07:21.007
Bet a dollar, you get $500.

07:21.107 --> 07:23.109
-You shitting me, Harold?
-Uh!

07:23.176 --> 07:24.911
What if my numbers
don't come out?

07:24.977 --> 07:26.746
Well, if your
numbers don't hit,
you don't get nothing.

07:26.813 --> 07:29.015
Harold collects
everybody's bets
and gives it to the Man.

07:29.115 --> 07:31.684
How you think the Italians
drive those long, fancy cars

07:31.784 --> 07:34.120
and wear those diamond
Swiss watches on their wrists?

07:43.863 --> 07:46.999
Thank you. Thank you,
everybody, welcome.

07:47.099 --> 07:48.501
-Uh...

07:48.601 --> 07:52.772
Well, mostly, I...
I just want to say how pr...

07:54.040 --> 07:54.974
Knock it off, Anthony.

07:57.977 --> 08:01.547
I want to say how proud I am
of my big girl, Janice...

08:01.647 --> 08:03.483
who is today...

08:04.550 --> 08:05.718
a woman.

08:05.818 --> 08:08.554
Cheers!
-

08:08.654 --> 08:10.723
You know, Janice, she, uh...

08:10.823 --> 08:12.992
She went to her catechism.

08:13.059 --> 08:14.994
She practiced her Latin.

08:15.061 --> 08:17.897
She even stopped
watching those two  stunods,
Sonny and Cher,

08:17.997 --> 08:19.398
long enough to think
about God, huh?

08:19.499 --> 08:21.067
Too much fucking
salt on this.

08:21.167 --> 08:24.070
At least for a minute or two,
but... boy, did she cost me.

08:24.170 --> 08:25.838
You know,
I made a bet that, uh,

08:25.905 --> 08:28.307
Janice would not do
her religious duties.

08:28.374 --> 08:32.011
But if Janice did,
you know, got confirmed...

08:32.078 --> 08:34.213
I'd shave off my mustache.

08:35.314 --> 08:37.984
Ooh...

08:38.050 --> 08:39.919
Enjoy.
-His  comare  told him

08:40.019 --> 08:42.421
it makes him
look like Robert Goulet.

08:49.729 --> 08:51.230
This stuff ain't so authentic.

08:51.330 --> 08:52.365
Ow!

08:53.533 --> 08:55.234
Just use your fork.

08:55.334 --> 08:56.769
But, you know,
the gravy's good.

08:56.869 --> 08:59.739
Oh. Come here.
-Your daughter's confirmation.

08:59.839 --> 09:01.040
Congrats, skip.

09:01.107 --> 09:03.075
I'm here, too, Mr. Handsome.

09:03.175 --> 09:05.244
Yeah, and looking like
a million dollars.

09:05.344 --> 09:07.446
And not
Mexican dollars, either.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.782
-What are you talking about?
-

09:13.019 --> 09:17.123
Same fucking gang.
Colored kids hit
one of my colored runners.

09:17.223 --> 09:19.358
Threw him a beating.

09:19.425 --> 09:21.961
You believe this?
How these people
prey on their own?

09:22.061 --> 09:24.964
Hey, Boot DiMeo's gonna
rag on me when he sees this.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.133
It looks bad too,
perception-wise.

09:27.233 --> 09:30.636
Even the papers say
the numbers is the biggest
percentage of our cash flow.

09:32.071 --> 09:34.307
Junior's right, you gotta get
your arms around this.

09:39.211 --> 09:40.947
You got big ears there,
gagootz?

09:41.047 --> 09:45.151
Big brother,
go and get yourself
some Pez.

09:50.456 --> 09:52.892
Silvio, Puss, come here.

09:53.960 --> 09:55.962
-Marone!
-Oh!

09:56.062 --> 09:57.663
Ah? The second
Mrs. Hollywood Dick.

09:57.763 --> 09:59.899
I was just explaining
to His Holiness, here.

09:59.966 --> 10:01.834
I think I went to school
with your father.

10:01.934 --> 10:03.069
Calogero Dante.

10:04.070 --> 10:05.171
"Butch."

10:05.271 --> 10:07.306
He said you were a bully.

10:07.406 --> 10:12.244
Whoa, what do we got here?
The Italian actress,
Sophia Lotsa-Pizza.

10:12.311 --> 10:14.580
Get out of here,
you fucking mutt!

10:15.848 --> 10:17.249
Uh... Sorry.

10:17.316 --> 10:20.186
Buddha. It's Joe D.
He's up at the Boot's Mansion.

10:21.253 --> 10:23.522
Mr. DiMaggio.  Come stai?

10:23.623 --> 10:26.959
Your saints name
you took in church today,
Apollonia?

10:27.026 --> 10:29.996
She's the patron saint
of dentists.

10:38.004 --> 10:41.774
Take it from me,
chains are more effective
than snow tires.

10:41.841 --> 10:43.676
Why didn't you bring
the missus, Dick?

10:43.776 --> 10:46.545
I tried, but the poor kid's
self-conscious about
her English.

10:46.646 --> 10:48.781
She's making progress, though.

10:48.848 --> 10:50.383
I didn't catch the name.

10:50.483 --> 10:52.118
Pussy.

10:52.184 --> 10:54.820
Don't worry, Father,
it's not what you think it is.

10:58.190 --> 11:00.393
This is my dog.

11:00.493 --> 11:04.296
This is my dog.

11:04.363 --> 11:07.333
This is your dog.

11:07.400 --> 11:10.403
This is your dog.

11:11.504 --> 11:12.738
Your dog.

11:14.707 --> 11:17.143
Buddy Durham
in the light trunks...

11:17.209 --> 11:18.744
the white trunks.

11:18.844 --> 11:20.913
Durham has always been known
as a counter-puncher...

11:21.013 --> 11:23.849
-Huh...
-

11:23.916 --> 11:26.085
He gets
a great hook in there.

11:26.686 --> 11:27.687
Hey.

11:32.024 --> 11:33.659
What did you learn to say?

11:35.861 --> 11:39.832
This... is... his... ball.

11:43.235 --> 11:44.670
Whose ball?

11:46.539 --> 11:47.440
Spot.

11:50.543 --> 11:55.047
Oh, I think this is
a waste of money.

11:55.114 --> 11:57.583
We hear from Hoboken's
own Chairman of the Board.

11:57.683 --> 12:00.553
Hi, there, my name
is Francis Albert Sinatra

12:00.619 --> 12:02.021
and I got news for you.

12:02.088 --> 12:04.223
Here's your host,
William B. Williams.

12:04.290 --> 12:07.226
My mother met
his mother once. Frank.

12:07.293 --> 12:12.131
Frank? He grabbed me
to go to some party once.

12:12.231 --> 12:15.534
It was on the Upper East Side,
it was a penthouse.

12:15.601 --> 12:18.237
Some celebrity,
I don't know who.

12:18.304 --> 12:24.243
So... he and Dean, they have
this donkey brought downstairs
to the basement.

12:24.310 --> 12:26.979
And the donkey's just stuffed
full of laxatives, right?

12:27.079 --> 12:28.948
So they put it in
the private elevator.

12:29.048 --> 12:31.817
They send
the private elevator up,
the door opens,

12:31.917 --> 12:36.922
and the donkey starts kicking
and shitting over everybody
in the party!

12:41.727 --> 12:43.462
Oh!

12:43.562 --> 12:45.831
Ah, your sister's cunt!

12:45.931 --> 12:48.834
Junior,
it's the Summer of Love.

12:51.170 --> 12:53.339
It's just a line to you

12:53.439 --> 12:58.077
And never seemed
so right before...

13:02.414 --> 13:03.349
Nice car.

13:04.483 --> 13:06.352
You a friend of Dickie's?

13:06.452 --> 13:07.820
No English.

13:13.259 --> 13:14.593
Oh!

13:14.660 --> 13:16.662
Hopalong  Che Si Dice!

13:18.831 --> 13:20.466
It's fucking light again?

13:20.533 --> 13:23.435
Picked up from
most of the runners,
but this kid, Overall...

13:23.502 --> 13:25.004
Who the fuck is Overall?

13:25.104 --> 13:27.106
He's a crazy young motherfucker
that runs the Saints.

13:27.173 --> 13:28.040
Leon Overall.

13:28.140 --> 13:29.875
He's from East Orange.

13:29.975 --> 13:32.545
My cousin's, uh,
the placekicker over
at the high school over there.

13:32.645 --> 13:35.681
Yeah, well me and Harold
played East Orange
Thanksgiving game.

13:35.781 --> 13:37.550
We used to beat 'em
every fucking year.

13:37.650 --> 13:39.051
You should have
seen this man run.

13:39.151 --> 13:40.886
Are you sure you don't
got no Black blood?

13:40.986 --> 13:43.556
That's Sicilians.
I'm Napoletano.

13:43.656 --> 13:46.025
Oh! I'm Siciliano.

13:48.694 --> 13:50.362
Come on. Come over here.

13:55.401 --> 13:58.704
The big picture, you told me
this thing was over
with the Black Saints.

13:58.804 --> 14:00.539
I know, I...

14:00.639 --> 14:02.842
thought I schooled the kid,
Overall, when I whupped him,
but...

14:04.143 --> 14:06.378
He's got a wild hair
across his ass.

14:07.580 --> 14:09.682
I gotta know, Harold...

14:09.748 --> 14:12.518
aren't you humiliated
by what you just said?

14:13.252 --> 14:14.687
I know I would be.

14:15.721 --> 14:17.423
You're a grown man.

14:17.523 --> 14:20.092
Fucking punk street gang?

14:50.556 --> 14:52.358
Come on in, son. Have a seat.

15:01.901 --> 15:03.936
I think we lost him.

15:05.271 --> 15:08.440
Hold up. Hold up. Turn around.

15:08.540 --> 15:12.111
Would I for sure
be going to Vietnam?
Like my dream?

15:12.211 --> 15:13.812
You heard about the G.I. Bill?

15:13.913 --> 15:16.615
Yeah, college. Sure.

15:16.715 --> 15:18.083
Thinking about being a...

15:18.150 --> 15:20.052
-scientist.
-Hmm.

15:21.420 --> 15:22.554
Wait over there.

15:25.157 --> 15:26.926
No, this... this war
wasn't my idea!

15:47.012 --> 15:50.082
Isola, turn that light out.
I'm trying to sleep.

15:50.149 --> 15:52.284
That's why I brought you
a 7 and 7, baby.

15:56.455 --> 15:57.756
What's the matter with you?

15:59.425 --> 16:02.795
Goddamn Gentleman
Dickie Moltisanti.

16:04.129 --> 16:06.498
Always comes to me
to handle his nasty work.

16:07.800 --> 16:09.935
Done made you
his house nigga.

16:20.679 --> 16:21.947
Put it away.

16:31.824 --> 16:34.059
The army won't take me now.

16:35.995 --> 16:39.064
I always wanted
to join up, but I...

16:39.164 --> 16:41.667
I had two felony convictions.

16:41.734 --> 16:42.901
Take you?

16:44.737 --> 16:48.073
Happened to stop by
a recruiting office today,
and it made me remember.

16:48.173 --> 16:51.710
Brothers doing
all the dying over there.
We don't need no more.

16:51.810 --> 16:53.512
Well, somebody's gonna to win
the Medal of Honor.

16:55.080 --> 16:56.248
Not a Black man.

16:57.049 --> 16:57.916
Please.

16:59.184 --> 17:01.553
Ooh, baby, you are
a riot tonight.

17:20.406 --> 17:21.607
Make a right here.

17:21.707 --> 17:22.775
It's a one-way.

17:22.875 --> 17:24.376
Fuck it, make the right.

17:41.627 --> 17:42.594
Fuck.

17:55.441 --> 17:57.276
Step out of the car.

17:57.376 --> 17:59.311
I know what I did, Officer.

18:09.088 --> 18:13.725
with your sigh

18:28.240 --> 18:29.341
Oh!

18:36.782 --> 18:39.518
Hey, why aren't they home,
sleeping till noon?

18:39.618 --> 18:43.856
Two officers picked up
some colored taxi driver,
had to rough him up a little.

18:43.956 --> 18:45.357
These morons think
we killed him.

18:45.457 --> 18:47.659
It spread around
the Central Ward that way.

18:47.759 --> 18:49.528
They broke windows
up and down Belmont Avenue.

18:49.628 --> 18:51.130
They're throwing bricks
and bottles at us.

18:51.196 --> 18:52.865
We got two officers
had to go to the hospital.

18:52.965 --> 18:54.466
- No shit.

18:56.201 --> 18:58.203
You ain't nothin'
without that badge!

18:59.138 --> 19:00.672
You think this is funny?

19:11.817 --> 19:16.455
for a day...

19:23.562 --> 19:25.230
Get the fuck away
from the car!

19:41.747 --> 19:44.750
and she kissed me

19:50.088 --> 19:52.424
Ladies and gentlemen,
let's hear it for
our host tonight.

19:52.524 --> 19:54.893
They call him
Gentleman Dick Moltisanti.

19:59.865 --> 20:01.066
Ahh!

20:06.171 --> 20:07.072
Paulie.

20:07.773 --> 20:08.874
This?

20:12.511 --> 20:16.348
It's about time.
Pinto the Butcher
sent over some capuzzelle.

20:16.415 --> 20:18.050
The fuck happen to you?

20:20.852 --> 20:22.854
There's something
you gotta see.

20:37.402 --> 20:38.904
What the fuck?

20:39.771 --> 20:41.640
That's Belmont Avenue.

21:39.798 --> 21:41.767
You wanna get smart now?

21:42.501 --> 21:43.769
Ma vaffanculo!

22:20.172 --> 22:22.007
Why don't you go after
the  ditsoon,  huh?

22:22.074 --> 22:23.742
They almost
burned the city down.

22:23.842 --> 22:25.377
Oh, you'll hold
the door, huh.

22:25.477 --> 22:26.978
Daddy!

22:27.045 --> 22:28.747
Janice, go home!
- Daddy!

22:28.847 --> 22:30.215
Go home!
Take the bus.

22:36.021 --> 22:38.390
Hey, stop! Stop!

22:38.490 --> 22:39.991
-Agh!

22:40.058 --> 22:41.593
- Anthony!

22:43.028 --> 22:45.430
Anthony! What are
you doing here?

22:54.206 --> 22:56.108
My God!

22:57.242 --> 22:58.677
What did they do?

22:58.744 --> 23:00.545
We raided a card game,
but we got lucky.

23:00.612 --> 23:02.781
Picked up your husband
on an outstanding warrant.

23:02.881 --> 23:03.782
Had to take 'em somewhere.

23:03.882 --> 23:05.117
Warrant? For what?

23:05.217 --> 23:07.252
Assault with a deadly weapon.

23:07.352 --> 23:08.587
The Lobster Trap Restaurant?

23:08.687 --> 23:10.222
That wasn't him.
He didn't do that.

23:10.288 --> 23:11.256
Where is he?

23:11.356 --> 23:12.758
Downtown.

23:12.858 --> 23:14.459
He's downtown,
where he might get
burned to death?

23:14.559 --> 23:16.395
-What are you people thinking?
-

23:16.461 --> 23:18.296
Janice, shut up with that!

23:18.397 --> 23:21.032
What were the two of you doing
at that card game?

23:21.099 --> 23:23.435
Dad took Janice
to ride the rides
while he played cards.

23:23.535 --> 23:27.639
But he wouldn't take me
because I passed gas
while he was eating lunch.

23:27.739 --> 23:30.709
Get inside, both of you!

23:33.111 --> 23:33.979
Anthony!

23:50.762 --> 23:55.801
Standing in the ruins
Of another Black man's life

23:55.901 --> 24:00.939
Or flying through the valley
Separating day and night

24:01.006 --> 24:04.609
"I am death," cried the vulture

24:04.676 --> 24:07.412
"For the people of the night"

24:13.452 --> 24:17.689
In a wilderness of heartbreak
And a desert of despair

24:19.458 --> 24:22.761
Evil's clarion of justice
Shrieks a cry of naked terror

24:22.828 --> 24:27.866
Taking babies from their mommas
Leaving grief beyond compare

24:27.966 --> 24:30.702
Please help me! Help me!
Please, help me!

24:30.802 --> 24:35.373
So if you see
the vulture coming
Flying circles in your mind

24:35.474 --> 24:38.543
-Remember,
there is no escaping

24:38.643 --> 24:42.113
For he will follow
close behind

24:42.180 --> 24:44.649
Only promise me a battle

24:44.716 --> 24:48.186
Battle for your soul
and mine

24:49.221 --> 24:50.856
And mine

24:50.956 --> 24:53.191
Talk to young Negro men
on the street

24:53.291 --> 24:55.627
and they will
tell you, they say,

24:55.694 --> 24:59.064
they're supposed to go away
and die for this country
that isn't really theirs?

24:59.164 --> 25:02.234
This tells you
right there that for
understandable reasons,

25:02.334 --> 25:05.237
they don't consider themselves
complete Americans.

25:05.337 --> 25:07.405
And I don't say this
comprises all of them,

25:07.506 --> 25:10.542
but it's obvious the reason
they can burn their
own homes...

25:11.376 --> 25:12.544
Huge fire.

25:14.179 --> 25:15.347
Ashes.

25:29.427 --> 25:31.396
Thought I heard
somebody fall.

25:32.831 --> 25:34.499
You fall this morning?

25:36.034 --> 25:37.903
I tripped in the bathtub.

25:38.537 --> 25:40.338
Oh.

25:40.405 --> 25:43.875
You shouldn't
wear your sunglasses
in the tub, you know?

25:51.283 --> 25:52.617
He's got a temper.

25:52.717 --> 25:54.853
È arrabbiato,  my father.

25:57.422 --> 25:59.291
He start to yell.

25:59.391 --> 26:02.193
Yeah, he wasn't like this
back in Ariano?

26:02.260 --> 26:06.298
'Cause he used to...
me, as a kid.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.567
Every day.

26:10.602 --> 26:13.038
I should have stayed there.

26:13.104 --> 26:14.406
No.

26:17.909 --> 26:20.745
Maybe I come to America
for America money.

26:21.813 --> 26:22.914
But...

26:25.083 --> 26:28.420
But here,
in America, he become...

26:29.888 --> 26:30.922
Uno stronzo!

26:37.762 --> 26:40.231
I think maybe
you still love him.

26:50.275 --> 26:52.143
What's the matter with you?

26:53.678 --> 26:55.413
My wife's right inside.

26:59.150 --> 27:00.919
You're my father's wife.

28:00.178 --> 28:01.212
Oh.

28:03.381 --> 28:04.916
Where are you going?

28:05.016 --> 28:08.920
I'm going down to Rexall.
The doc switched
my blood thinner.

28:09.020 --> 28:10.422
I'll ride with you.

28:22.534 --> 28:23.535
What?

28:24.369 --> 28:25.670
How high did she bounce?

28:25.737 --> 28:27.172
What are you talking about?

28:27.238 --> 28:28.940
When you threw her
down the stairs.

28:29.040 --> 28:31.076
Got two left feet.

28:31.176 --> 28:32.744
'Cause you used to throw
my mother down the stairs.

28:32.844 --> 28:34.446
I didn't like it then,
I don't like it now.

28:34.546 --> 28:37.515
Well, some women
like the rough stuff.
Don't ask me why.

28:37.582 --> 28:41.853
Yeah, it's funny how
they're all attracted to
Hollywood Dick Moltisanti.

28:41.920 --> 28:44.055
You wanted to get
into her fucking pants

28:44.122 --> 28:45.957
since the day
I brought her over.

28:46.057 --> 28:49.127
I give you permission
to picture her while
you're jerking off.

28:49.227 --> 28:52.197
I promise you,
you hurt her again,
you're going down the stairs.

28:52.263 --> 28:54.299
-Who the fuck do you think
you're fucking talking to?
-You got away with it

28:54.399 --> 28:55.900
once with Mom.
But I was a little kid.

28:55.967 --> 28:57.235
You're not getting away
with it again.

28:57.302 --> 29:01.473
Oh, I marry sluts.
What do I know?

29:01.573 --> 29:06.111
Ow! Hey! Get...
Get your fucking...
Get off me!

29:06.211 --> 29:07.145
Hey! Hey!

29:15.253 --> 29:16.154
Dick...

29:34.339 --> 29:35.607
Pop.

29:48.353 --> 29:49.454
Pop?

30:49.747 --> 30:52.150
Uncle Dickie.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.686
Anthony, what the fuck
are you doing?

30:54.752 --> 30:56.254
The city's burning down.

30:56.354 --> 30:57.522
Over on Springfield Avenue.

30:57.589 --> 30:59.591
Dickie? Who blew the horn?

30:59.691 --> 31:01.559
I'm working
on the car.

31:01.659 --> 31:03.394
You want pork chops tonight?

31:03.494 --> 31:04.729
Yeah, that's fine.

31:04.829 --> 31:06.164
Can I watch you
work on the car?

31:06.231 --> 31:07.498
With the applesauce?

31:07.565 --> 31:09.667
I don't know what sauce!

31:09.734 --> 31:11.336
I gotta go out for a while.

31:11.402 --> 31:12.570
Can I?

31:13.504 --> 31:14.505
Can you what?

31:14.572 --> 31:16.174
Watch.

31:16.241 --> 31:17.742
What the fuck did I
just say, God damn it?
Now, go home!

31:28.686 --> 31:30.855
...from the newsroom.

31:30.922 --> 31:34.292
American warplanes
have expanded the air war
over North Vietnam

31:34.392 --> 31:37.395
with the bombing of five
previously untouched targets

31:37.462 --> 31:40.198
near the heart of
the port city of Haiphong.

31:40.265 --> 31:44.302
Four of the new targets,
one of them only a mile
and a half from Haiphong...

32:00.652 --> 32:02.654
Democratic Majority Leader
Mike Mansfield

32:02.754 --> 32:04.455
-sounded a warning tonight...
-Go ahead, sir.

32:05.623 --> 32:06.624
He's white.

33:52.196 --> 34:00.671
a love-in there

34:00.738 --> 34:07.912
of San Francisco...

34:08.012 --> 34:10.081
Three guesses
who they blame this on.

34:10.181 --> 34:11.349
The Harlem Globetrotters.

34:15.086 --> 34:16.187
Shh.

34:28.966 --> 34:34.305
They called him Hollywood Dick.
Imagine what he looks like now.

34:34.405 --> 34:36.808
Tell Ma what you told me,
about the bird.

34:36.908 --> 34:39.043
There was a bird
in the garage.

34:39.110 --> 34:40.078
So?

34:40.144 --> 34:41.412
It means
somebody's gonna die.

34:41.479 --> 34:44.215
You're talking
through your hat.

34:44.282 --> 34:47.985
A bird would never
fly into a garage
to announce a death.

34:48.085 --> 34:49.754
A house is another matter.

34:52.824 --> 34:54.325
Poor Dickie.

34:55.960 --> 34:57.495
I still can't believe it.

35:09.273 --> 35:12.844
I gotta talk to Johnny Soprano,
the putrescible trash routes.

35:12.944 --> 35:14.679
The Sposato Brothers
are making a grab.

35:14.779 --> 35:17.281
You didn't hear?
Johnny's gonna be
a guest of the government.

35:17.348 --> 35:18.850
He couldn't make bail.

35:18.950 --> 35:21.119
When my brother's away,
everything goes through me.

35:21.185 --> 35:22.453
You got diarrhea?

35:23.921 --> 35:25.123
Comedian.

35:31.662 --> 35:33.030
The three C's I owe you.

35:33.131 --> 35:35.500
What the fuck is this?
It's supposed to be cash.

35:35.600 --> 35:36.934
That's an RCA.

35:41.172 --> 35:42.507
What am I gonna do with this?

35:53.284 --> 35:55.153
What a blow.

35:55.219 --> 35:57.822
Yeah, well,
at least you still got
your brother. I'm...

35:59.490 --> 36:03.060
Yeah. I got nobody.

36:03.161 --> 36:06.831
Dickie, consider me your
brother from now on, huh?

36:14.138 --> 36:16.007
Where's your brother?

36:16.073 --> 36:19.177
He went to see if he could
sneak into the room
where they do the bodies.

36:21.746 --> 36:23.414
In Newark tonight,

36:23.514 --> 36:26.017
state troopers
and the National Guard
ceased...

36:26.083 --> 36:27.318
You son of a bitch.

36:27.385 --> 36:29.587
You can't watch
television in here.

36:29.687 --> 36:31.822
Vincent, it's the news.

36:31.889 --> 36:33.324
...President Johnson,
we've been told,

36:33.391 --> 36:35.226
has been following
the situation...

36:35.326 --> 36:40.164
Ah, they're never gonna
catch those bastards.
I told the cops.

36:40.231 --> 36:45.436
In the dull
and commonplace occurrences
of day-to-day living,

36:45.536 --> 36:52.243
one thing stands out
as a completely unique
experience: Colt .45.

36:54.946 --> 36:56.280
Jesus Christ.

36:56.380 --> 36:58.416
The fuck's
the matter with you?

36:58.516 --> 37:01.752
You have
no respect for my father,
you fucking animals!

37:01.852 --> 37:03.588
He's dead!

37:03.688 --> 37:05.456
Looks like the riots
are ending though, Dick,
that's good news.

37:05.556 --> 37:08.059
I wish that
the shooter killed you!

37:08.125 --> 37:09.727
All of you!

37:21.405 --> 37:23.140
John Francis Soprano.

37:23.241 --> 37:25.743
On the charge of assault
with a deadly weapon,

37:25.810 --> 37:29.146
I hereby sentence you
to no more than five

37:29.247 --> 37:33.317
and no less than two years
in Rahway State Prison.

37:54.805 --> 37:57.008
-

38:10.488 --> 38:12.023
Uncle Sally.

38:13.457 --> 38:15.593
I'm Dickie,
your brother Dick's boy.

38:24.969 --> 38:26.370
How are you?

38:28.272 --> 38:32.343
You know, I'm sorry,
I know I never came
to visit you before.

38:32.443 --> 38:34.011
My father wouldn't allow it.

38:41.719 --> 38:43.354
I came to tell you...

38:44.889 --> 38:48.893
your brother, my dad...
he passed.

38:48.993 --> 38:51.195
They burned him up
in the riots.

38:52.863 --> 38:55.566
I brought you
some sfogliatelle.

38:56.701 --> 38:58.469
I don't eat dairy.

38:59.136 --> 38:59.970
Oh.

39:04.008 --> 39:06.310
Well, you being
out here isolated,

39:06.377 --> 39:07.845
out of contact
with the family,

39:07.912 --> 39:09.480
my old man said
you deserved it,

39:09.547 --> 39:12.583
but I want to do whatever I can
to help you from now.

39:12.683 --> 39:14.685
It wasn't right
how they treated you.

39:16.020 --> 39:17.555
I was 25.

39:17.655 --> 39:21.425
I murdered a made guy
in our own family.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.829
I'm here for a good reason.
You don't need to help me.

39:25.830 --> 39:27.098
But...

39:27.198 --> 39:28.733
What do you want, Richard?

39:35.206 --> 39:36.841
I'll be honest with you.

39:39.377 --> 39:41.112
I want to do a good deed.

39:41.212 --> 39:42.446
Huh!

39:42.546 --> 39:43.881
A what?

39:45.383 --> 39:46.751
A good deed.

39:52.890 --> 39:54.859
Miles.

39:54.925 --> 39:57.027
Birth of the Cool.

39:58.462 --> 39:59.463
What?

39:59.563 --> 40:00.564
It's a record.

40:00.631 --> 40:02.900
I'm a jazz nut.

40:02.967 --> 40:05.536
Bring me a copy
next time you come.

40:06.237 --> 40:07.438
If you come.

40:12.543 --> 40:13.978
-

40:23.387 --> 40:25.289
-Quant'e bella!
-Sì?

40:26.056 --> 40:28.259
It's so beautiful.

40:29.927 --> 40:31.962
We're gonna go down
to Bamberger's.

40:32.062 --> 40:34.465
We're gonna fill
the place with furniture.

40:35.933 --> 40:37.435
Madonna mia.

40:39.437 --> 40:40.504
Mmm.

40:42.773 --> 40:44.809
Could you give us
a few minutes?

40:44.909 --> 40:46.243
You got it.

40:58.022 --> 41:00.524
Aunt Concetta says
you've been looking for a job.

41:00.624 --> 41:04.195
At, uh, DiLorenzo Brothers
Beauty Parlor.

41:04.295 --> 41:06.197
I cut hair back in Ariano.

41:06.297 --> 41:08.365
You don't need to do that.

41:08.466 --> 41:10.468
I want to keep
taking care of you.

41:10.534 --> 41:14.805
But I like to work, Dickie.
And America has so many work.

41:14.872 --> 41:18.209
Un giorno,  I want to have
my own beauty parlor.

41:18.309 --> 41:20.711
Well, you're not gonna work
for those two  fanooks.

41:21.779 --> 41:23.481
The DiLorenzos?

41:46.737 --> 41:48.305
Motherfucker.

41:48.372 --> 41:51.141
-I like that word.

41:51.208 --> 41:52.743
Motherfucker.

42:01.085 --> 42:02.419
Eighteen. Paul's birthday.

42:02.520 --> 42:04.188
We don't take
Beatle birthdays.

42:04.255 --> 42:06.090
We'd go broke.

42:06.190 --> 42:09.593
Fuck it. Make it eight.
Micky Dolenz.

42:09.693 --> 42:13.931
I dreamed about
Whitey Ford last night.
He wears number 16.

42:16.333 --> 42:18.202
The boys
basketball team is playing
St. Stephen's this afternoon.

42:18.269 --> 42:21.405
The high temperature today
will be 53 degrees.

42:21.505 --> 42:25.509
Faculty advisory,
absentees: 16.

42:25.576 --> 42:27.711
Sixteen, I hit the number!

42:29.580 --> 42:31.582
You gotta talk to him.

42:31.682 --> 42:33.584
Johnny should do it.
- You're the only one
he listens to.

42:33.684 --> 42:35.219
Johnny should do it.
You're gonna see him
visiting day.

42:35.286 --> 42:36.620
- Side door's open.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.122
Johnny's just gonna
want to hit him,

42:38.222 --> 42:40.257
and he can't because of
the glass partition

42:40.357 --> 42:42.293
and he's just gonna
get frustrated.

42:44.061 --> 42:47.131
Hey, Jun'.
-I got some
Lady Schick blow dryers.

42:47.231 --> 42:49.600
Livia, take one for yourself.
One for Janice.

42:49.700 --> 42:51.435
I got bigger problems
than blow dryers.

42:51.535 --> 42:53.470
Anthony got kicked
out of school.

42:53.571 --> 42:55.272
Let me go talk to him.

42:55.372 --> 42:57.474
I promised Johnny
I'd take care of Tony
while he was in jail.

42:57.575 --> 43:00.144
The way you talk,
you just confuse him.

43:00.244 --> 43:01.946
He only listens to Dickie.

43:02.046 --> 43:03.981
Ma vaffanculo.

43:04.081 --> 43:06.750
Jun', leave me
a blower for Joanne.

43:11.622 --> 43:12.923
What are you reading?

43:15.392 --> 43:18.596
Oh, can't you read
a regular comic?

43:18.662 --> 43:20.631
You know,
Superman, Jughead.

43:20.731 --> 43:23.133
It's about some
Jewish girl and a knight.

43:23.233 --> 43:24.735
And Robin Hood's in it.

43:24.802 --> 43:28.172
I didn't know they had Jews
back in the Middle Ages.

43:28.272 --> 43:30.307
Well... the Bible.

43:30.407 --> 43:33.510
Anyway, your mother
asked me to talk to you, so...

43:33.611 --> 43:36.280
What, about getting
suspended from school?

43:36.347 --> 43:38.349
Hey, put that down, huh?

43:38.449 --> 43:39.683
Sorry.

43:46.657 --> 43:49.860
You know I don't like to
lean on you about stuff.

43:49.960 --> 43:53.430
But you can't start
a gambling operation
at school.

43:53.497 --> 43:54.932
I know that...

43:54.999 --> 43:56.266
now.

43:56.333 --> 43:58.535
Hey, don't bullshit me.
You always knew it.

43:58.636 --> 44:00.704
And it's not
just the gambling.
It's everything.

44:00.804 --> 44:04.108
The cherry bombs at the YMCA,
letting the air out of
Mrs. Russo's tires...

44:04.174 --> 44:05.843
-I apologized to her!
-You talk big about

44:05.943 --> 44:07.511
wanting to be
on the football team
in high school

44:07.611 --> 44:09.446
and you're smoking
already? Oh!

44:09.513 --> 44:12.149
You gotta have
a better attitude.

44:12.216 --> 44:14.852
With your father gone,
your mother's got
a lot on her plate.

44:14.952 --> 44:16.854
You gotta be good.

44:16.954 --> 44:19.390
I don't want to go
through this again.

44:19.490 --> 44:21.058
I try to be good.

44:21.158 --> 44:24.561
I don't think so.
Try harder.

44:28.899 --> 44:30.067
Pinky swear?

44:30.167 --> 44:31.468
Jesus.

44:31.535 --> 44:33.570
Hey, you don't talk
to me like that.

44:33.671 --> 44:36.240
See, you're not listening.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.176
Fine. Pinky swear.

44:47.017 --> 44:48.652
All right.

44:51.055 --> 44:53.057
One time I went to Playland...

44:53.157 --> 44:56.393
I saw the cops shoot a friend
of my dad's right in the back.

44:56.493 --> 45:00.831
Yeah, Chickie Sasso.
He still can't move
his bowels like normal.

45:04.234 --> 45:06.036
I don't want that
to happen to me.

45:06.103 --> 45:09.273
And it won't,  gagootz.
Not while I'm around.

45:09.373 --> 45:11.909
We're gonna see
that it don't.

45:30.794 --> 45:34.765
Junior. Junior.
Where's Candy tonight?

45:34.865 --> 45:36.133
Migraine.

45:36.233 --> 45:37.935
Again with the migraine.

45:38.035 --> 45:40.070
Keep a close eye
on that one.

45:40.137 --> 45:42.906
She keeps disappearing,
she's probably fucking some
Tom, Dick and Harry.

45:42.973 --> 45:44.641
-Found a new gravy train.
-

45:44.742 --> 45:46.710
A guy checks into a hotel,
calls up the front desk,

45:46.777 --> 45:49.913
"I got a leak in the sink."
Clerk says, "Go ahead.

45:49.980 --> 45:52.416
-Customer's always right."
-

45:52.483 --> 45:55.085
Yeah, that was funnier when
Henny Youngman told it.

45:55.152 --> 45:57.154
No, no, don't... Don't.
Just leave it the way it is.

45:57.254 --> 46:01.125
I wonder what the origin
of the sobriquet
"gravy train" is.

46:01.225 --> 46:03.327
They named it after
the dog food.

46:03.427 --> 46:04.995
I don't know
about you, Junior.

46:05.095 --> 46:07.331
Guy tells you your girlfriend's
banging somebody else,

46:07.431 --> 46:09.833
you're worried about
the origin of "gravy train"?

46:09.933 --> 46:12.069
Oh!
-

46:12.136 --> 46:13.971
Oh, smile, my brother.

46:18.442 --> 46:19.843
White flight.

46:19.943 --> 46:22.579
Oh!
It's Hopalong  Che Si Dice.

46:22.646 --> 46:23.847
Whatever the fuck
that means.

46:23.947 --> 46:27.584
Hey! Language.
There's ladies here.

46:27.651 --> 46:29.186
What can I get you?

46:29.286 --> 46:32.156
Bartender's special tonight,
for the ladies: Pink Squirrel.

46:32.256 --> 46:34.525
Courvoisier and Coke.
Water back.

46:34.625 --> 46:37.694
That what they
drink on the plantation?

46:39.496 --> 46:42.933
Oh, you didn't hear?
We're off the plantation.

46:43.000 --> 46:45.769
We got wops digging ditches
since they come over.

46:45.836 --> 46:47.437
Hey, come on.

47:00.150 --> 47:02.486
It's Dickie's business.
Let it go, Paulie.

47:02.553 --> 47:04.655
What the fuck's
the matter with you?

47:04.721 --> 47:06.523
You got a murder warrant
over your head.

47:06.623 --> 47:09.026
I'm heading down south.
North Carolina.

47:09.126 --> 47:11.061
So where's your mule?
Get going.

47:11.161 --> 47:13.030
Thing is, I need to
borrow some money.

47:13.130 --> 47:15.899
-How much?
-A grand.

47:15.999 --> 47:19.369
All right, I'll tell you what.

47:21.071 --> 47:24.208
I'm gonna give you
five C's. Yeah?

47:24.308 --> 47:26.677
It's my gift to you.
You don't gotta give it back.

47:26.743 --> 47:28.579
No, I want to pay you back.

47:28.679 --> 47:30.581
Ah, it's better this way.
You don't gotta be afraid
to say hello to me,

47:30.681 --> 47:33.917
I don't gotta chase you down.
Won't come between us.

47:34.017 --> 47:36.053
So I guess this is goodbye.

47:42.426 --> 47:44.862
Yeah, you said your goodbye,
so go.

48:02.045 --> 48:06.850
You don't stare
at those people.
They don't like it.

48:15.559 --> 48:17.127
Brought you that
record you wanted.

48:17.227 --> 48:20.030
Plus, a couple others
I picked out.

48:20.097 --> 48:21.798
What's this?

48:21.899 --> 48:25.969
Al Hirt. Trumpet.
He's on Carson all the time.

48:26.069 --> 48:28.939
It's not jazz. Take it back.

48:30.307 --> 48:32.075
These, too.

48:40.651 --> 48:42.319
So...

48:42.419 --> 48:44.154
you did your good deed.

48:44.254 --> 48:46.089
Well, don't put it like that.

48:47.157 --> 48:49.126
I plan to do a lot more.

48:51.161 --> 48:54.131
Your poor father, huh?

48:54.231 --> 48:59.436
He goes down to board up
that Atta Boy business
that he had...

48:59.503 --> 49:03.173
and he dies
in that horrible way.

49:03.273 --> 49:05.008
It's just weird, though.

49:05.108 --> 49:06.576
What, weird?

49:06.643 --> 49:11.515
My brother's hands were soft.
Like a baby's  pishadeel.

49:11.615 --> 49:14.751
Always with the manicures,
your father.

49:14.818 --> 49:16.486
Yeah, what's your point?

49:16.586 --> 49:21.124
He never touched a hammer
or a board in his life.

49:29.866 --> 49:31.768
What's your problem?

49:36.306 --> 49:38.642
Well, for one thing...

49:38.709 --> 49:41.511
my wife, she can't
get pregnant.

49:41.611 --> 49:45.048
You know, it takes a toll.
I want a son so bad.

49:45.148 --> 49:46.650
What would you do?

49:47.317 --> 49:49.152
It's the wanting.

49:49.886 --> 49:51.221
Huh?

49:51.321 --> 49:54.558
The Buddhist will tell you:
"All life is pain."

49:55.959 --> 49:59.062
Pain comes from
always wanting things.

50:00.330 --> 50:02.132
A son is not a thing.

50:03.734 --> 50:05.402
It's the wanting.

50:10.874 --> 50:13.810
You know, Tone, we could
still run that numbers game
down at the fucking CYO.

50:13.877 --> 50:16.146
I got fucking suspended,
I can't get in fucking
trouble again.

50:16.213 --> 50:18.482
No. Fucking school
will never know.

50:18.548 --> 50:20.083
I want to make it to
the NFL someday.

50:20.183 --> 50:21.685
For that, I gotta
go to college.

50:21.752 --> 50:23.854
So I gotta watch
my fucking ass.

50:23.920 --> 50:26.723
My old man
told me I gotta run his fucking
restaurant when I grow up.

50:26.823 --> 50:28.658
What does your old man say?

50:28.725 --> 50:30.594
He says
I gotta fucking rob
your old man's restaurant.

50:32.429 --> 50:35.665
Do you know who I'd wanna be?
Your Uncle Dickie.

50:35.732 --> 50:37.434
How he fucking dresses.

50:37.534 --> 50:40.937
He said he'd give me $500
if I graduate from
fucking high school.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.439
Fuck, man.

50:46.043 --> 50:52.582
of circular time?

50:52.682 --> 50:59.389
has got you in its sway

50:59.456 --> 51:05.195
has got you in its sway

51:07.431 --> 51:09.299
The '60s ended.

51:09.399 --> 51:12.469
Neil Young gave that
speech from the moon.

51:12.569 --> 51:16.106
Then came the RICO statutes
around when I was born.

51:18.075 --> 51:20.210
I wish I had come before that.

51:22.979 --> 51:24.481
Hey, Uncle Dick.

51:24.581 --> 51:27.150
They're gonna be here soon.
We gotta get inside and hide.

51:27.250 --> 51:30.554
Hey, Anthony,
you go see
Dirty Harry  like I told you?

51:30.620 --> 51:33.990
"You gotta ask yourself,
do you feel lucky?"

51:34.091 --> 51:35.792
"Well, do you, punk?"

51:39.930 --> 51:41.298
Madonna.

51:42.999 --> 51:46.169
It's that old fig tree,
in 'Lino's backyard.

51:46.269 --> 51:47.838
-Nothing changes.
-Yeah.

51:52.476 --> 51:53.944
Nothing changes?

51:54.010 --> 51:56.746
That's... that's
Poupette's house.

51:59.850 --> 52:01.685
-What are you mad at me for?
-Ah, you...

52:01.785 --> 52:03.520
Mother...

52:03.620 --> 52:05.956
How did you let this happen?

52:06.022 --> 52:08.158
Oh, what do you want
from me, Johnny?

52:08.258 --> 52:10.527
I had plenty on my shoulders
taking care of things
while you were in the joint.

52:10.627 --> 52:12.129
Yeah.

52:12.195 --> 52:14.264
Raising Anthony. The disaster
with the Electricians Union.

52:14.331 --> 52:15.799
-Ah!
-Your wife with the cramps.

52:15.866 --> 52:18.468
Boo-hoo-hoo!
Look at Dickie Moltisanti.

52:18.535 --> 52:21.037
His father gets whacked,
he steps up.

52:21.138 --> 52:23.440
Takes care of his family,
takes care of all the business.

52:23.507 --> 52:26.643
Not a peep out of him.
He's younger than you.

52:27.978 --> 52:29.112
Yeah.

52:29.179 --> 52:31.114
- Surprise!

52:31.181 --> 52:32.883
Jesus Christ.
- There he is.

52:32.983 --> 52:35.118
All I want to do is
bang my  goomar,
go to sleep.

52:35.185 --> 52:37.053
-Hey.
-Good to see you.

52:37.154 --> 52:40.724
Hey, Paulie,
how's your ma, huh?
- Much better.

52:40.824 --> 52:41.958
Johnny.

52:42.025 --> 52:44.528
Hey, baby, how are you?
Come here.

52:44.628 --> 52:47.397
Did the surprise work?

52:47.497 --> 52:49.499
You know, I'll tell you
what surprised me.

52:49.566 --> 52:51.067
You got shiners on
the block, huh?

52:51.168 --> 52:53.336
Oh, look at you.
Not a pound.

52:53.403 --> 52:55.739
He's just a regular
Charlton Heston.

52:55.839 --> 52:57.908
You come,
you visit...

52:58.008 --> 53:01.011
But you don't tell me
they moved in.
On my street.

53:01.077 --> 53:02.245
He's a doctor.

53:02.345 --> 53:03.747
-A doctor.
-He's not operating on me.

53:03.847 --> 53:05.682
You gotta berate me
in front of everybody?

53:05.749 --> 53:06.650
Ah, Jesus.

53:06.716 --> 53:07.551
You know, just like always.

53:07.651 --> 53:08.585
Ah,  va' a Napoli.

53:08.685 --> 53:09.853
Come on.

53:11.688 --> 53:13.757
Hi, Dad.

53:13.857 --> 53:15.325
What do you got on?

53:15.392 --> 53:17.661
Go upstairs, right now,
put on some decent clothes.

53:17.727 --> 53:20.597
Johnny, it's what
they're wearing nowadays.

53:20.697 --> 53:22.399
Go do what I said, Janice.

53:24.568 --> 53:27.370
Sweetie. You recognize
your daddy, pumpkin?

53:27.437 --> 53:31.208
Yeah. That's it. Yeah.

53:31.274 --> 53:34.678
What's the matter with you?
Go give your father
a proper hello.  Stunod!

53:34.744 --> 53:38.415
Come here.

53:41.685 --> 53:43.086
I missed you, Dad.

53:43.186 --> 53:45.522
I missed
you too, kid.

53:45.589 --> 53:47.857
You know, I made your
favorite pizza gain.

53:47.924 --> 53:49.893
Even though it's not Easter.

53:49.960 --> 53:52.762
I got everybody together.
I dressed up.

53:52.862 --> 53:55.699
And you spit on
it all, on me!

53:55.765 --> 53:58.068
I didn't invite the coloreds
onto the block!

53:58.134 --> 53:59.736
Here we go.

53:59.803 --> 54:01.871
Livia,
give him a break.
He just did four years.

54:01.938 --> 54:03.440
I did four years!

54:14.618 --> 54:16.386
I missed
your baked ziti, baby.

54:16.453 --> 54:19.389
I put extra veal bones in
with the sausage.

54:21.157 --> 54:23.994
How about you,  chooch?
You gonna be a linebacker, huh?

54:24.094 --> 54:27.664
Coach says
I'm gonna be starting.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.833
-He don't have the makings
of a varsity athlete.
-

54:29.933 --> 54:33.003
It was up to me,
you wouldn't be
playing at all,

54:33.103 --> 54:35.171
but you went ahead
and you forged
my signature.

54:35.272 --> 54:37.340
Nah, relax.

54:37.440 --> 54:38.675
He's not gonna get hurt.

54:38.775 --> 54:41.611
Here he is.
Fresh from his nap.

54:41.678 --> 54:42.846
Joanne, Joanne...
- Yeah?

54:42.946 --> 54:44.147
He hasn't met Johnny.

54:44.247 --> 54:45.515
Aw.

54:45.615 --> 54:46.650
Wow.

54:46.750 --> 54:49.185
Johnny, this is
our Christopher.

54:52.155 --> 54:56.159
Hello,
Christopher Moltisanti.
It's your Uncle Johnny.

54:56.259 --> 54:57.761
I'm back from England.

54:59.129 --> 55:00.764
-Go with your daddy.
-Come here.

55:00.830 --> 55:03.600
Oh!  Bambolino!

55:03.667 --> 55:07.937
Finally, huh?
Corrado, right?
Got myself a son.

55:08.004 --> 55:08.972
Hi.

55:09.039 --> 55:11.141
I hear he's slow
with the talking.

55:11.207 --> 55:12.809
Hi, Christopher, hello!

55:12.876 --> 55:14.177
-Oh!

55:14.277 --> 55:16.279
What's the matter?
Don't cry. It's only me,

55:16.346 --> 55:17.847
-your Uncle Tony.
- Oh!

55:17.947 --> 55:19.215
-What's wrong.
Cootchie-coo!
- Oh! Oh!

55:19.316 --> 55:20.984
Okay. All right. All right.

55:21.051 --> 55:24.020
You know, every time
you're near him
he cries like this.

55:24.120 --> 55:25.722
I didn't do anything.

55:27.891 --> 55:29.959
What happened?
-

55:30.026 --> 55:31.161
It's okay.

55:31.227 --> 55:32.862
Look at that.

55:32.962 --> 55:35.632
I don't know what it is,
it's like I scare him
or something.

55:35.699 --> 55:39.569
Some babies, when they
come into the world,

55:39.669 --> 55:43.173
know all kinds of things
from the other side.

55:54.718 --> 55:59.723
Night descends
As the sun's light ends

55:59.823 --> 56:03.059
And Black comes back,
to blend again

56:03.159 --> 56:05.228
-Wake up, nigga
- Yes!

56:05.328 --> 56:07.030
And with the death of the sun

56:07.097 --> 56:07.997
Wake up

56:08.064 --> 56:09.899
Night and blackness become one

56:09.999 --> 56:11.267
Wake up

56:11.368 --> 56:13.002
-Blackness being you
- Wake up, nigga

56:13.069 --> 56:16.039
Peeping through the red
The white, and the blue

56:16.106 --> 56:18.108
Dreaming of bars,
Black civilizations

56:18.208 --> 56:19.776
That once flourished and grew

56:19.876 --> 56:20.944
-Wake up, nigga
-Hey!

56:21.044 --> 56:22.879
Wake up, niggas,
or y'all through!

56:22.946 --> 56:25.215
He's right. He's right.

56:25.281 --> 56:27.717
Drowning in the puddles
Of the white man's spit

56:27.784 --> 56:28.952
Wake up

56:29.052 --> 56:30.286
As you
pause for some drawers

56:30.387 --> 56:31.921
-In the midst of shit
- Wake up

56:32.021 --> 56:35.024
And ain't got nothing
to save your funky-ass with

56:35.091 --> 56:37.394
-Wake up, nigga
-You cool, fool

56:37.460 --> 56:39.796
Sipping on a menthol cigarette
'round midnight

56:39.896 --> 56:42.732
Wake up
- Rapping about how
the Big Apple is outta sight

56:42.799 --> 56:44.901
Wake up
- When you
ain't never had a bite

56:44.968 --> 56:45.935
Wake up

56:46.035 --> 56:48.605
Who are you fooling?
Me, you?

56:48.705 --> 56:51.307
Wake up, niggas,
or we're all through!

56:51.408 --> 56:54.144
- Yeah! Yeah!

57:04.120 --> 57:07.424
That's some inspirational shit.
Even the speeches.

57:09.492 --> 57:11.728
This decides me.

57:11.795 --> 57:14.497
Know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna start my own book.

57:14.597 --> 57:15.665
You're gonna do what?

57:15.765 --> 57:17.267
We're gonna start...

57:18.635 --> 57:21.905
first Black numbers bank
in the Central Ward.

57:25.608 --> 57:30.346
Nigga, you talking
about facing down
the motherfucking mafia.

57:30.447 --> 57:32.248
Frank Lucas will be my backer.

57:32.315 --> 57:35.018
He's got money
up his ass from the skag.

57:35.118 --> 57:36.352
You know the Dope King?

57:36.453 --> 57:38.087
Down home.

57:38.154 --> 57:40.457
Country boys.

57:40.523 --> 57:43.693
This ain't Greensboro,
North Cackalacky.

57:43.793 --> 57:46.529
The Italians got
soldiers over there.

57:46.629 --> 57:48.131
Okay?
That's what they call 'em.

57:48.198 --> 57:51.201
What... what's the matter,
you ain't no soldier?

57:51.301 --> 57:53.136
Never thought about
myself that way, no.

57:53.203 --> 57:54.304
Well, think about it.

57:56.773 --> 58:00.009
Right. "He's got a gun,"
you think, "and I haven't."

58:00.109 --> 58:01.444
You figure it's the gun.

58:02.512 --> 58:04.481
Well, listen, soldier.

58:04.547 --> 58:07.884
Thousands of guys got guns,
but there's only one
Johnny Rocco!

58:07.984 --> 58:09.953
How do you
account for it?

58:10.019 --> 58:12.021
Well,
he knows what he wants.
Don't you, Rocco?

58:12.121 --> 58:13.957
-Sure.
-  What's that?

58:14.023 --> 58:15.992
Tell him, Rocco.

58:16.059 --> 58:17.393
Well, I want, uh...

58:17.494 --> 58:20.063
He wants more.
Don't you, Rocco?

58:20.163 --> 58:21.898
Yeah, that's it. More.

58:21.998 --> 58:23.733
That's right, I want more.

58:23.833 --> 58:27.904
Here. Why don't you buy
you and your friends
some of those...

58:28.004 --> 58:29.739
McDonald's.

58:29.839 --> 58:31.574
-The burgers?
-Yeah.

58:31.674 --> 58:33.309
-  You,
do you know what you want?

58:33.376 --> 58:35.178
Yes, and I
had hopes once, but...

58:35.245 --> 58:37.247
Hopes for what?

58:37.347 --> 58:40.483
A world in which
there's no place
for Johnny Rocco.

58:40.550 --> 58:43.553
Okay, soldier, you can
make your hopes come true.

58:44.521 --> 58:46.422
But you gotta die for it.

58:46.523 --> 58:48.525
See where I'm aiming?
Right at your belly.

58:49.559 --> 58:51.094
Go ahead, shoot.

58:54.264 --> 58:57.033
-Your turn, Daddy.
- All right.

59:05.441 --> 59:08.578
Hey, Hopalong  Che Si Dice.

59:10.213 --> 59:12.248
Oh, fuck.

59:16.719 --> 59:18.288
How's it going, Harold?

59:18.388 --> 59:20.623
Cyril, how's your ass?

59:21.925 --> 59:23.092
How you doing, son?

59:24.561 --> 59:26.362
I'm taking my nephew
to the Yankees game.

59:28.398 --> 59:30.867
Is something funny
back there?

59:30.934 --> 59:32.569
Sorry, Uncle Dick.

59:32.635 --> 59:34.704
No, really, I'm sorry!

59:34.771 --> 59:36.139
You fuckstick.

59:36.239 --> 59:37.974
I heard your ass
was back in Jersey.

59:38.074 --> 59:39.943
You still got that warrant
over your head?

59:40.043 --> 59:43.246
Lead detective died.
Nobody gives a shit.

59:43.313 --> 59:44.914
Leon Overall
had been a white boy,

59:44.981 --> 59:47.150
it'd be a whole
different story.

59:47.250 --> 59:50.954
Hey, Harold,
how 'bout you come around,
talk to me over here.

59:58.761 --> 1:00:00.964
When are you gonna come back
and work for me again?

1:00:02.298 --> 1:00:06.002
Got stuff of
my own percolating.

1:00:06.102 --> 1:00:08.671
While you're waiting for
that Maxwell House to boil...

1:00:29.792 --> 1:00:31.828
Hey, how much he give you?

1:00:34.430 --> 1:00:36.833
Like I'm a fucking
Pullman porter.

1:00:36.933 --> 1:00:38.668
Man, it's $100.

1:00:44.140 --> 1:00:46.943
I need to see the lease.

1:00:47.977 --> 1:00:48.878
Here you go.

1:00:48.978 --> 1:00:50.013
Thank you.

1:00:51.814 --> 1:00:54.217
Due per cento
increase every year.

1:00:54.317 --> 1:00:56.386
Six and a half years still.

1:00:56.486 --> 1:00:57.520
Right?

1:00:57.620 --> 1:00:58.821
-I like.
-Yeah.

1:01:00.490 --> 1:01:01.724
It's Dionne Warwick.

1:01:01.824 --> 1:01:03.960
Comes from right over here
in South Orange.

1:01:04.027 --> 1:01:05.495
I love Dionne Warwick.

1:01:05.561 --> 1:01:07.030
Me, too.

1:01:07.130 --> 1:01:10.033
I wonder where she
gets her hair done.

1:01:10.133 --> 1:01:12.869
Probably some fancy place
in Beverly Hills.

1:01:12.969 --> 1:01:16.372
I bet she pays $100.
Oof!  Marone!

1:01:16.472 --> 1:01:18.708
I should move
to Beverly's Hill.

1:01:19.676 --> 1:01:21.811
Where'd you learn to do hair?

1:01:21.878 --> 1:01:23.746
I learned from  mia mamma.

1:01:23.846 --> 1:01:25.515
-Mmm.
-My...

1:01:25.581 --> 1:01:28.985
She had a chair
in the front room.

1:01:29.052 --> 1:01:33.222
Women would come,
and I sweep up.

1:01:33.322 --> 1:01:34.257
And I watch.

1:01:34.357 --> 1:01:35.758
Oh, how wonderful.

1:01:35.858 --> 1:01:38.061
But that's not the life
I want for me.

1:01:38.161 --> 1:01:39.662
-Mmm.
-Over there,

1:01:39.729 --> 1:01:41.831
you get old so fast.

1:01:41.898 --> 1:01:45.001
Ten children and a big,
black dress.

1:01:45.068 --> 1:01:46.703
You know, over there,

1:01:46.769 --> 1:01:48.938
I wanted to be a priest.

1:01:49.038 --> 1:01:51.941
-You mean "nun."
-No, no, priest.

1:01:52.041 --> 1:01:54.510
Nuns have to do
what they told.

1:01:54.577 --> 1:01:58.081
The priest is the boss.  Capo.

1:02:00.750 --> 1:02:03.252
So you never tried
the convent, huh?

1:02:03.352 --> 1:02:05.221
Not for me.

1:02:05.288 --> 1:02:08.891
I could not stand the silence.
No male.

1:02:08.958 --> 1:02:10.293
No, yeah.

1:02:10.393 --> 1:02:15.098
You wind up doing... push-ups
in the asparagus garden.

1:02:15.198 --> 1:02:16.299
You know?

1:02:21.804 --> 1:02:22.705
What's so funny?

1:02:22.772 --> 1:02:24.574
Nuns.

1:02:24.640 --> 1:02:27.110
Yeah. They weren't so funny
when they were hitting me
with a ruler.

1:02:29.078 --> 1:02:31.714
First thing you gotta do
is look at the lease.
Is that, uh, the lease?

1:02:31.781 --> 1:02:33.316
We already look at the lease.

1:02:33.416 --> 1:02:34.784
It's good.

1:02:34.884 --> 1:02:37.053
Oh, yeah? I'm gonna
look it over.

1:02:42.825 --> 1:02:46.596
Two percent increase a year,
six years still remaining.

1:02:46.662 --> 1:02:49.398
There's just one thing
I want to make better.

1:02:50.066 --> 1:02:50.933
Oh, yeah?

1:02:51.000 --> 1:02:52.602
-New sinks.
-Hmm.

1:02:53.436 --> 1:02:55.004
Those are disgust.

1:02:55.104 --> 1:02:58.674
We can do that, sure.

1:02:58.775 --> 1:03:00.576
This is some
fantastic salsicce.

1:03:00.643 --> 1:03:02.078
Guarda basso.

1:03:04.981 --> 1:03:07.517
I am worried about
the fucking boiler, though.

1:03:07.617 --> 1:03:09.418
Looked like shit.

1:03:09.485 --> 1:03:10.920
Inspector says it's fine.

1:03:10.987 --> 1:03:13.456
Okay, okay. But the thing
about remodeling is,

1:03:13.523 --> 1:03:15.258
you start with the sinks
and then you go,

1:03:15.324 --> 1:03:16.359
"We might as well
do this other thing
while we're at it."

1:03:16.459 --> 1:03:17.326
It spins out of control.

1:03:17.426 --> 1:03:18.294
Ah.

1:03:20.096 --> 1:03:22.532
We don't want to be pouring
good money after bad.

1:03:24.267 --> 1:03:26.469
Can you stop eating
for one minute?

1:03:28.137 --> 1:03:31.607
Finisci di mangiare
poi stammi a sentire.

1:03:31.674 --> 1:03:35.311
No  capisce,
but I'm all fuckin' ears.

1:03:35.378 --> 1:03:37.847
So we're not going to buy it
for me, the beauty parlor?

1:03:37.947 --> 1:03:41.217
All I'm saying,
I don't want us walking
into a stupid situation.

1:03:41.317 --> 1:03:42.618
You think I'm stupid?

1:03:42.685 --> 1:03:44.554
Oh, let me ask you,
what are you, on the rag?

1:03:44.654 --> 1:03:48.057
Every time I say
something you don't like,
you ask me if I'm...

1:03:48.157 --> 1:03:49.859
il marchese.

1:03:49.959 --> 1:03:53.296
First you tell me
to find a store I can turn
into beauty parlor.

1:03:53.362 --> 1:03:55.398
I do that.
You say it looks good.

1:03:55.498 --> 1:03:59.168
Then you say,
"No, let's buy a place
already a beauty parlor."

1:03:59.235 --> 1:04:01.704
I find this place.
Now the boiler!

1:04:01.804 --> 1:04:03.973
Sweetheart, why are we arguing
about fucking plumbing?

1:04:04.040 --> 1:04:06.576
I always want to do
right by you!

1:04:06.676 --> 1:04:08.744
You know, I love you!

1:04:08.845 --> 1:04:10.179
Io ti voglio piu bene
di quanto tu ne vuoi a me,
lo vuoi capire o no?

1:04:10.246 --> 1:04:11.547
You know
I don't speak Italian!

1:04:11.647 --> 1:04:13.316
Maybe you should learn!

1:04:13.382 --> 1:04:14.584
Oh, where you going?

1:04:14.684 --> 1:04:17.019
To put on a robe.
I'm cold.

1:04:38.574 --> 1:04:40.710
Better hurry up.
Pot roast night.

1:04:40.776 --> 1:04:42.545
Right. You know Wednesdays
I gotta go home.

1:04:42.612 --> 1:04:44.013
And what are you
getting so pissy about?

1:04:44.080 --> 1:04:45.948
Why did I make the sausage?

1:04:47.283 --> 1:04:48.584
To make me happy?

1:04:49.585 --> 1:04:51.053
Because I love it?

1:04:51.120 --> 1:04:53.356
But it's not as good as
Joanne's fucking pot roast.

1:04:53.422 --> 1:04:55.391
Oh, you're digging
at Joanne again.

1:04:55.458 --> 1:04:56.559
I hate her.

1:04:56.626 --> 1:05:00.229
Of course you do.
It's only natural.

1:05:00.296 --> 1:05:03.032
Go home and eat.
I don't want the beauty salon.

1:05:03.099 --> 1:05:04.300
No,  vaffanculo.

1:05:04.400 --> 1:05:05.735
Motherfucker!

1:05:07.637 --> 1:05:09.438
You think you know everything!

1:05:32.628 --> 1:05:34.330
Jackie, you drive stick?

1:05:34.430 --> 1:05:35.898
-Fuck no.
-I do!

1:05:35.965 --> 1:05:36.832
You drive.

1:05:36.933 --> 1:05:38.801
Grab his arm, hold him down.

1:05:39.635 --> 1:05:41.137
Fucking punks!

1:05:47.443 --> 1:05:49.412
We're gonna get in
so much fucking trouble!

1:05:49.478 --> 1:05:51.747
My father's gonna
use the belt on me!

1:05:51.814 --> 1:05:53.482
You little shit!

1:05:53.582 --> 1:05:57.987
If anybody tells
anybody about this,
next time we use the belt.

1:05:58.087 --> 1:06:01.691
stand back,

1:06:01.791 --> 1:06:07.530
Ah, don't worry
'bout me, babe

1:06:07.630 --> 1:06:10.533
Oh! Come here!
Free ice cream!

1:06:16.839 --> 1:06:18.541
Here, here.

1:06:21.310 --> 1:06:22.712
Get more of it.

1:06:27.149 --> 1:06:30.052
Here, here.
Here you go.
Here you go.

1:06:30.152 --> 1:06:33.489
How 'bout this one?
There you go, sweetheart.

1:06:36.492 --> 1:06:38.461
That manicott
at Vesuvio's is so rich.

1:06:38.527 --> 1:06:40.830
How'd you hear
about them throwing
Mister Softee a beating?

1:06:40.896 --> 1:06:43.065
His cousin
Tony Blundetto
told Janice.

1:06:43.165 --> 1:06:45.301
I was down in the islands
when he pulled that shit.

1:06:45.368 --> 1:06:48.237
If I was home, I'd have
given him a  schiaffo
he'd never forget.

1:06:48.337 --> 1:06:50.006
What's he want to be
when he gets older?

1:06:50.072 --> 1:06:52.408
Thinks he's gonna be
a football player.

1:06:52.508 --> 1:06:55.845
He's good.
I don't think
he's pro material.

1:06:55.911 --> 1:06:57.546
What do you think, Dick?

1:06:57.646 --> 1:07:00.549
Probably not. But who knows,
he puts on a few pounds,

1:07:00.649 --> 1:07:02.351
four years of college ball...

1:07:02.418 --> 1:07:04.320
He should go to work
for my cousin Frank

1:07:04.387 --> 1:07:06.088
in the patio
furniture business.

1:07:06.188 --> 1:07:07.390
Here we go with that tune.

1:07:07.490 --> 1:07:08.858
So maybe he's not
a ball player, but Li,

1:07:08.924 --> 1:07:10.159
you don't wanna step
on the kid's dream.

1:07:10.226 --> 1:07:11.560
You always
take his side.

1:07:11.660 --> 1:07:13.929
Look, you give him
the best advice you can,

1:07:14.030 --> 1:07:16.732
you lead by example,
he'll make the right decision.

1:07:16.832 --> 1:07:19.101
This kid's got what it takes.
That's what I'm saying.

1:07:19.201 --> 1:07:21.937
We all do things like that
when we're kids, right?

1:07:22.038 --> 1:07:23.773
Beat up the Mister Softee man.

1:07:23.873 --> 1:07:27.076
If my Christopher
grew up to be like Tony,
I'd be goddamn proud of him.

1:07:27.176 --> 1:07:28.844
I told him the other day,
I said,

1:07:28.911 --> 1:07:31.247
"You play football
for a career,
it doesn't last long.

1:07:31.347 --> 1:07:34.250
You wind up
an old crippled man
by the time you're 32."

1:07:34.350 --> 1:07:37.887
Bobby Piocosta, he's a junior,
on Anthony's team.

1:07:37.953 --> 1:07:40.289
He fractured
his shoulder last week.

1:07:40.389 --> 1:07:41.924
The mother was hysterical.

1:07:42.024 --> 1:07:44.126
They had to take him to
a specialist at St. Barnabas.

1:07:44.226 --> 1:07:45.861
You think the school's
gonna pay for that?

1:07:45.928 --> 1:07:47.797
That's some
Christmas present, huh?

1:07:47.897 --> 1:07:51.367
Having your kid laid up.
He can't help outside,
hang the decorations.

1:07:51.434 --> 1:07:53.135
He can't help
shovel the walk...

1:08:05.414 --> 1:08:06.949
Don't give me that look.

1:08:31.774 --> 1:08:33.943
I though it will be different.

1:08:35.911 --> 1:08:36.846
What?

1:08:38.647 --> 1:08:40.649
Make love with a Black man.

1:08:41.951 --> 1:08:42.918
Is it?

1:08:45.254 --> 1:08:46.122
No.

1:08:49.291 --> 1:08:52.361
It's all about
Italian men, huh?

1:08:52.461 --> 1:08:55.197
There's stories
about Dean Martin
and Rossano Brazzi,

1:08:55.297 --> 1:08:56.799
how they're great lovers.

1:08:58.467 --> 1:08:59.702
If you feed them.

1:09:02.538 --> 1:09:04.206
Oh!

1:09:04.306 --> 1:09:07.877
You gotta give Dickie his
meatballs and his noodles.

1:09:07.977 --> 1:09:10.012
I'm Dickie's  comare.

1:09:13.616 --> 1:09:17.386
Dickie and his friends,
they like their women
to stay at home.

1:09:17.486 --> 1:09:19.388
Don't go out.

1:09:19.488 --> 1:09:21.524
Wait on them, hand and feet.

1:09:24.727 --> 1:09:26.996
I'd stack my bread
if you were my girl.

1:09:28.697 --> 1:09:30.232
You want to have
your own beauty parlor?

1:09:30.332 --> 1:09:32.902
Knock yourself out.
I'd even back it.

1:09:33.002 --> 1:09:34.970
You want your woman to work?

1:09:35.037 --> 1:09:37.239
No, but I'd be
real proud of her.

1:09:38.374 --> 1:09:40.509
Owning a business.

1:09:40.576 --> 1:09:43.012
My mama used to
take in the washing.

1:09:44.680 --> 1:09:46.815
I always respected her
for that.

1:09:54.056 --> 1:09:58.260
Dickie says colored men
don't have no head
for making money.

1:10:11.407 --> 1:10:13.676
Well, that's what
we're gonna find out.

1:10:27.590 --> 1:10:30.926
You will not be able
to stay home brother!

1:10:31.026 --> 1:10:33.229
Four, two, seven.

1:10:33.295 --> 1:10:34.697
Box it for me?

1:10:34.763 --> 1:10:36.632
You know, another nurse
hit the number last night.

1:10:36.732 --> 1:10:37.933
Big time.

1:10:38.033 --> 1:10:39.802
Damn. Who was it?

1:10:39.902 --> 1:10:41.904
What do I know, it was
up in the First Ward.

1:10:41.971 --> 1:10:43.639
It was, uh...
It was St. Michaels.

1:10:43.739 --> 1:10:46.642
That jinxes it for me.

1:10:46.742 --> 1:10:48.377
The revolution will not
be brought to you

1:10:48.444 --> 1:10:50.546
by the  Schaefer Award Theatre.

1:10:50.613 --> 1:10:54.116
And will not star Natalie Woods
and Steve McQueen
or Bullwinkle and Julia.

1:10:56.252 --> 1:10:58.954
See, the law of averages say
you got the same chance
of hitting

1:10:59.054 --> 1:11:00.322
as any two random people.

1:11:00.422 --> 1:11:02.258
Yeah, but two people
at the same time

1:11:02.324 --> 1:11:04.059
don't have
the same chance of winning.

1:11:04.126 --> 1:11:05.561
That's the law of averages.

1:11:05.628 --> 1:11:08.130
That's a fallacy,
Ms. Johnson.
It's all random.

1:11:08.230 --> 1:11:09.765
You don't understand fate.

1:11:13.335 --> 1:11:15.137
What do you got
for me, professor?

1:11:17.473 --> 1:11:18.474
See you tomorrow.

1:11:25.914 --> 1:11:28.117
Tomorrow there'll be
a brother here for the pickup.

1:11:30.352 --> 1:11:32.288
No more whitey's cut.

1:11:40.362 --> 1:11:41.830
What the fuck, man?

1:11:45.367 --> 1:11:47.836
The revolution will be live.

1:11:55.978 --> 1:12:01.116
And this Black guy,
Harold McBrayer,
popped one of my guys.

1:12:01.183 --> 1:12:03.052
He used to be a runner
of mine.

1:12:03.152 --> 1:12:05.454
We don't know who ordered it.
We can't find McBrayer.

1:12:06.655 --> 1:12:08.791
So what do you
want from me?

1:12:08.857 --> 1:12:11.860
I was thinking maybe
you could ask in here.

1:12:11.960 --> 1:12:13.962
Nation of Islam,
talk to Alonzo Turner,

1:12:14.029 --> 1:12:15.564
see if any of them
knows anything.

1:12:15.664 --> 1:12:18.067
I don't talk
to people in here.

1:12:19.535 --> 1:12:21.170
I mostly read all day.

1:12:25.240 --> 1:12:27.676
How you doing
on your merit badges?

1:12:30.479 --> 1:12:33.082
I'm coaching
a beep baseball team.

1:12:33.182 --> 1:12:34.683
A who?

1:12:34.750 --> 1:12:37.886
It's baseball. For blind kids.

1:12:39.555 --> 1:12:41.023
Get the fuck outta here.

1:12:41.090 --> 1:12:42.591
No, for real.

1:12:52.701 --> 1:12:54.403
Run, run, run, come on!

1:12:54.503 --> 1:12:55.904
Shortstop, left!

1:12:57.339 --> 1:12:59.274
-Attaboy!

1:12:59.375 --> 1:13:02.578
Way to go, Coach.
Our boys looked
sterling out there today.

1:13:02.678 --> 1:13:06.081
Two, four, six, eight,
who do we appreciate?

1:13:06.181 --> 1:13:10.052
Coach Moltisanti!
Coach Moltisanti!

1:13:10.119 --> 1:13:11.620
You're a saint!

1:14:01.437 --> 1:14:03.739
Oh, shit!
- Gun!

1:14:06.642 --> 1:14:08.677
Where's Harold?

1:14:08.777 --> 1:14:11.013
In your mother's
fat guinea ass.

1:14:11.113 --> 1:14:12.681
You take that back!

1:14:12.781 --> 1:14:14.983
Who put him up to it,
Angelo Salerno?

1:14:15.684 --> 1:14:17.186
Anthony Bello?

1:14:17.286 --> 1:14:18.787
Chef Boyardee.

1:14:20.255 --> 1:14:22.024
-Come.
-

1:14:23.759 --> 1:14:25.027
Put him on the table!

1:14:26.929 --> 1:14:28.764
Pussy, grab his legs.

1:14:31.500 --> 1:14:34.203
What are you gonna do,
rotate my tires?

1:14:37.473 --> 1:14:39.208
Dick, I just got this jacket.

1:14:42.978 --> 1:14:43.879
You...

1:14:45.981 --> 1:14:47.449
Open!

1:14:47.516 --> 1:14:48.383
What about it?

1:14:48.484 --> 1:14:49.551
Fuck you!

1:14:55.123 --> 1:14:56.058
Stop for a minute!

1:14:56.158 --> 1:14:58.193
God damn it!

1:14:58.293 --> 1:15:00.729
Oh! I don't fucking...

1:15:01.663 --> 1:15:03.232
-So?
-

1:15:05.234 --> 1:15:07.736
Harold! Harold McBrayer!

1:15:07.836 --> 1:15:09.304
I asked you
whose idea it was!

1:15:09.371 --> 1:15:12.641
I told you! It was Harold!
Nobody put him up to it!

1:15:12.708 --> 1:15:13.842
Oh.

1:15:33.228 --> 1:15:35.163
The fucker
acted on his own?

1:15:36.865 --> 1:15:37.933
All right, Dickie.

1:15:38.033 --> 1:15:39.902
- Go get it.

1:15:42.538 --> 1:15:46.608
That fall,
Johnny moved to the suburbs,
the Black thing.

1:15:46.708 --> 1:15:49.945
And he was seriously earning.

1:15:50.045 --> 1:15:53.115
This move made
Tony half a pussy,
in my estimation.

1:15:55.217 --> 1:15:58.020
What made you think
it was a good idea

1:15:58.086 --> 1:16:00.455
to steal the answers
to the geometry test?

1:16:02.391 --> 1:16:05.761
I didn't study,
and, uh, I needed to pass,

1:16:05.861 --> 1:16:08.430
so I could stay
on the football team.

1:16:08.530 --> 1:16:09.865
You know,

1:16:09.932 --> 1:16:11.867
you got Charlie Nodzak
in trouble, too,

1:16:11.934 --> 1:16:14.903
when you paid him
for the answers.

1:16:14.970 --> 1:16:17.372
Well, he was the only kid
I knew on the mimeo squad.

1:16:17.439 --> 1:16:20.242
Well, Charlie was
on the honor roll.

1:16:20.309 --> 1:16:22.411
And you're missing the point.

1:16:22.477 --> 1:16:24.613
You know stealing
the tests was wrong.

1:16:26.882 --> 1:16:28.717
Yeah, I guess so.

1:16:28.784 --> 1:16:30.552
But if you're gonna
kick me out of school,

1:16:30.619 --> 1:16:33.221
I mean, you should just do it,
instead of us talking about it.

1:16:35.591 --> 1:16:37.593
You talk a lot at home?

1:16:39.828 --> 1:16:41.096
I don't know.

1:16:43.298 --> 1:16:47.502
Well, your dad, for example,
what does he talk to you about?

1:16:50.772 --> 1:16:51.807
The lawn.

1:16:52.774 --> 1:16:54.109
What about the lawn?

1:16:55.344 --> 1:16:57.179
I don't know,

1:16:57.279 --> 1:17:01.249
he goes to Yankee Stadium
and he comes home and says
our lawn looks crummy.

1:17:01.316 --> 1:17:05.420
What about your mother?
Is she someone
who likes to talk a lot?

1:17:07.289 --> 1:17:08.357
I guess so.

1:17:10.959 --> 1:17:11.827
Well...

1:17:12.995 --> 1:17:14.796
what makes her happy?

1:17:15.530 --> 1:17:16.632
Happy?

1:17:16.698 --> 1:17:17.933
My mother?

1:17:23.438 --> 1:17:25.440
Let's go, Anthony.

1:17:25.507 --> 1:17:28.810
I wonder if I
could talk to you for a moment
alone, Mrs. Soprano?

1:17:29.811 --> 1:17:31.279
Well, it's gonna
have to be fast,

1:17:31.346 --> 1:17:32.981
'cause I'm parked
at the hydrant.

1:17:38.487 --> 1:17:40.622
On the basis of
the Stanford-Binet,

1:17:40.689 --> 1:17:43.225
he's high IQ,
but you know that.

1:17:43.325 --> 1:17:47.129
You can't prove it by me.
He's got a D-plus average.

1:17:47.195 --> 1:17:51.667
Well, that's because
he doesn't apply himself,
but he is smart.

1:17:51.733 --> 1:17:58.507
There's a big difference
between a smart person
and a smart aleck.

1:17:58.573 --> 1:18:03.745
I also administered
the Briggs-Myer personality
inventory just now,

1:18:03.845 --> 1:18:06.181
and the results tell us,
he's a leader.

1:18:07.482 --> 1:18:11.086
"Enthusiastic,
insightful, playful."

1:18:11.186 --> 1:18:13.822
Ah, you're talking
through your hat.

1:18:16.992 --> 1:18:19.594
He did tell me one thing
I'd like to share with you.

1:18:19.695 --> 1:18:22.230
But it's gotta be fast,
because I'm still
at the hydrant.

1:18:22.330 --> 1:18:23.932
Do you remember
a children's book called

1:18:24.032 --> 1:18:25.400
-Sutter's Mill?
-No.

1:18:25.500 --> 1:18:28.070
About the gold rush
in California?

1:18:28.170 --> 1:18:30.839
Yeah, maybe I do. Yeah?

1:18:30.906 --> 1:18:35.043
He told me about a night
your husband was... away.

1:18:37.212 --> 1:18:39.414
And you got in the bed
with Anthony and hugged him.

1:18:46.888 --> 1:18:48.123
He said that?

1:18:48.223 --> 1:18:51.860
No, his exact words were
you "snuggled up close."

1:19:00.235 --> 1:19:03.638
Yeah. Yeah,
I remember that now.

1:19:03.739 --> 1:19:06.141
You read to him
from that book.

1:19:06.241 --> 1:19:08.076
Long into the night,
apparently.

1:19:08.143 --> 1:19:10.412
He remembered details.

1:19:10.479 --> 1:19:12.147
He didn't know
the word "ingot,"

1:19:12.247 --> 1:19:14.549
and you explained it to him.

1:19:19.888 --> 1:19:22.791
He said it was one of his
best memories of his life.

1:19:34.669 --> 1:19:36.605
Is that a hotel Bible?

1:19:38.440 --> 1:19:40.275
I forget where I got it.

1:19:41.276 --> 1:19:44.479
Baby, Cousin Cyril is dead.

1:20:01.363 --> 1:20:02.831
You're supposed
to do an hour.

1:20:02.931 --> 1:20:04.966
It's an hour on,
ten minutes off.

1:20:05.033 --> 1:20:07.869
All of a sudden youse
two are only on 40 minutes
and then disappear.

1:20:07.969 --> 1:20:10.105
We don't know
where the fuck you are.

1:20:10.172 --> 1:20:12.774
We're off somewhere thinking,
"What more can we do for
Gentleman Dick and Johnny?"

1:20:12.841 --> 1:20:14.376
Don't get cute.

1:20:14.476 --> 1:20:16.378
Where's Giuseppina tonight?

1:20:17.512 --> 1:20:19.548
The movies
with her girlfriend.

1:20:19.648 --> 1:20:21.183
I would eat her shit.

1:20:21.283 --> 1:20:22.384
Oh!

1:20:26.121 --> 1:20:28.156
You don't talk
about her that way.

1:20:28.223 --> 1:20:30.392
In fact, you don't
talk about her at all.

1:20:30.492 --> 1:20:31.726
Hey, take it easy!

1:20:31.827 --> 1:20:33.728
-I love her. I love her!
-

1:20:33.829 --> 1:20:35.697
Get down!
-

1:20:38.500 --> 1:20:40.335
Hey, asshole!
- Dickie!

1:20:41.303 --> 1:20:42.170
Motherfucker!

1:20:49.578 --> 1:20:51.246
Come on, you fucker.
Come here.

1:20:51.346 --> 1:20:52.914
-You like that, huh?
-

1:20:53.014 --> 1:20:54.716
-How 'bout that?
- Come on,
you motherfuckers.

1:20:57.252 --> 1:20:58.587
Fuck!

1:21:10.232 --> 1:21:13.501
No, no, no! Frankie,
Frankie, Frankie! Frankie!

1:21:14.369 --> 1:21:15.270
No!

1:21:16.605 --> 1:21:17.606
You mother...

1:21:21.710 --> 1:21:22.611
Shit!

1:22:55.303 --> 1:22:56.938
Anthony, come eat!

1:23:02.310 --> 1:23:03.712
There's my big boy.

1:23:03.812 --> 1:23:05.880
Oh, cool, man, a hamburger.

1:23:05.981 --> 1:23:08.550
I thought you'd like a change
from a mortadella sandwich.

1:23:08.650 --> 1:23:10.385
I made it special for you.

1:23:13.154 --> 1:23:14.689
You look nice.

1:23:14.789 --> 1:23:16.458
Aw.

1:23:16.524 --> 1:23:20.028
Me and Aunt Mary
are going to the city
to see  No, No, Nanette.

1:23:20.996 --> 1:23:22.063
What's that?

1:23:22.163 --> 1:23:23.832
Broadway. A play.

1:23:23.898 --> 1:23:26.568
Shoes are killing my bunions.

1:23:26.668 --> 1:23:29.137
You should go see
Dr. Cuomo.

1:23:29.204 --> 1:23:31.539
We don't go to him anymore.

1:23:32.407 --> 1:23:33.842
We don't?

1:23:33.908 --> 1:23:36.911
He said some
very rude things to me.

1:23:37.012 --> 1:23:38.146
Like what?

1:23:38.213 --> 1:23:41.916
He wants me to take pills
for my sleeping.

1:23:42.017 --> 1:23:43.918
And... and other things.

1:23:45.520 --> 1:23:47.355
I'm not some lunatic.

1:23:48.757 --> 1:23:51.092
No, but maybe some
medicine would be good.

1:23:51.192 --> 1:23:54.095
Ah, you and your father.
Why don't you get in line
to blame me?

1:23:54.195 --> 1:23:56.264
I wasn't blaming you,
I was just saying...

1:23:56.364 --> 1:24:00.001
This new thing...
called Elavil.

1:24:00.068 --> 1:24:01.903
For people who are sick
in the head.

1:24:06.374 --> 1:24:12.113
Of a mother's little helper

1:24:12.213 --> 1:24:13.048
What?

1:24:14.049 --> 1:24:15.617
It's a song.

1:24:15.717 --> 1:24:16.718
It's by the Stones.

1:24:16.785 --> 1:24:18.686
Exactly what I'm talking about.

1:24:18.753 --> 1:24:21.289
They're drug addicts.
I don't take drugs.

1:24:21.389 --> 1:24:25.026
The song's not saying
that you take drugs, it's...

1:24:28.530 --> 1:24:30.732
You smoking marijuana,
I suppose?

1:24:31.699 --> 1:24:33.468
Mom, I'm on the team.

1:24:33.568 --> 1:24:36.471
Your sister is.
I'm almost sure of it.

1:24:36.571 --> 1:24:38.807
-This hamburger's great, Mom.
It's really good.
-Agh!

1:24:38.907 --> 1:24:41.142
Go on.

1:24:41.242 --> 1:24:43.078
I went to all that trouble

1:24:43.144 --> 1:24:45.647
just so we could have
a nice conversation for once,
and for what?

1:24:45.747 --> 1:24:48.550
How am I supposed to enjoy
a Broadway show

1:24:48.616 --> 1:24:50.051
with my children
and their pot?

1:24:50.118 --> 1:24:51.619
Ma, I don't smoke pot!

1:24:51.719 --> 1:24:53.488
Well, your sister comes in here
smelling like a gypsy.

1:24:53.588 --> 1:24:56.091
Well, I'm not my sister.
I'm always being accused.

1:24:56.157 --> 1:24:59.327
Oh! Poor you!

1:25:21.082 --> 1:25:23.318
Sempre, sì,
sempre problemi al cuore.

1:25:26.287 --> 1:25:27.589
Don't look so blue, kid.

1:25:27.655 --> 1:25:30.692
You and me'll cut out,
go play catch.

1:25:30.792 --> 1:25:32.193
It's raining.

1:25:32.293 --> 1:25:33.661
...sa benedica,
gets put in the ground,

1:25:33.761 --> 1:25:34.462
all they want to do
is eat my food.

1:25:36.131 --> 1:25:38.766
It's not an Irish wake,
right, no food.

1:25:38.833 --> 1:25:39.834
You get carried to your car.

1:25:39.934 --> 1:25:41.669
Watch your step there, boss.

1:25:46.341 --> 1:25:48.209
-How you doing?
- How you been?

1:25:53.815 --> 1:25:55.150
Eckley,
how's the boy?

1:25:55.216 --> 1:25:57.485
Wonder what they
talk about in there.

1:26:06.661 --> 1:26:09.464
Uncle Dick, can I talk
to you for a minute?

1:26:09.531 --> 1:26:10.965
What's up, Joe Cocker?

1:26:11.032 --> 1:26:13.368
All right, I'm gonna
wait in the car.

1:26:13.468 --> 1:26:15.236
You help her? Help her.

1:26:15.336 --> 1:26:16.304
Well, spit it out.

1:26:18.473 --> 1:26:20.508
You ever heard of this?

1:26:21.843 --> 1:26:23.511
Yeah, so, what about it?

1:26:23.578 --> 1:26:25.580
Well, my mom's been
in a bad mood lately.

1:26:27.682 --> 1:26:31.152
The doctor said that
this medicine could help her,
but she won't take it.

1:26:31.219 --> 1:26:32.687
So what do you want from me?

1:26:32.754 --> 1:26:35.924
So I was thinking maybe
you could talk to her.

1:26:36.024 --> 1:26:37.392
What about your old man?

1:26:37.492 --> 1:26:39.694
Nah, she's not speaking to him.
He did something.

1:26:39.761 --> 1:26:41.596
I see the way
she looks at you.

1:26:41.696 --> 1:26:43.865
Always sits
next to you at dinners.

1:26:43.932 --> 1:26:46.000
She bought you that
fur hat for Christmas.

1:26:46.067 --> 1:26:47.769
I never wear it.

1:26:47.869 --> 1:26:50.905
I mean... she looks up to you.

1:26:51.005 --> 1:26:53.107
And maybe you could
get her some.

1:26:53.208 --> 1:26:54.275
You need a prescription.

1:26:54.375 --> 1:26:55.577
I can't get it
in my own name.

1:26:55.677 --> 1:26:57.078
I know you can get anything.

1:26:57.178 --> 1:26:58.446
Don't be a wise-ass.

1:26:58.546 --> 1:27:01.449
I'm not, I'm just saying
it could make her happy.

1:27:01.549 --> 1:27:02.750
Even Janice says.

1:27:02.850 --> 1:27:04.118
Janice.

1:27:04.219 --> 1:27:05.753
There's somebody we all
want to take advice from.

1:27:08.022 --> 1:27:09.023
Anthony!

1:27:10.091 --> 1:27:11.926
The pros play in the rain.

1:27:13.962 --> 1:27:15.463
Ah,
what are you doing, Jun'?
-Uncle Jun'!

1:27:19.234 --> 1:27:20.969
Oh,  Madonna mia!

1:27:21.069 --> 1:27:22.237
Stay down. Don't move him!

1:27:22.303 --> 1:27:23.471
Uncle Jun'!

1:27:23.571 --> 1:27:24.739
I just said
don't move him!

1:27:26.274 --> 1:27:27.942
Your sister's cunt!

1:27:28.042 --> 1:27:29.310
Corrado!

1:27:29.410 --> 1:27:31.546
I'm calling an ambulance.
God damn it.

1:27:31.613 --> 1:27:33.481
Here you go. Here you go.

1:27:33.581 --> 1:27:35.250
-Take my hand.
-Cocksucker!

1:27:38.753 --> 1:27:41.456
-

1:27:43.258 --> 1:27:49.264
or understand me

1:27:49.330 --> 1:27:54.836
they all hand me

1:27:54.936 --> 1:27:58.506
These are Frank Sinatra, Jr.
tickets for your uncle.

1:27:58.606 --> 1:28:01.843
I gotta fly down
to the dog track.

1:28:01.943 --> 1:28:05.013
They boast a string of hits
that seems to have no end,

1:28:05.113 --> 1:28:06.848
out of Philadelphia,
Pennsylvania,

1:28:06.948 --> 1:28:09.617
the mighty Delfonics.

1:28:10.685 --> 1:28:14.355
Hey, kid.
How's your rash?

1:28:14.455 --> 1:28:15.923
Uncle Dickie around?

1:28:20.662 --> 1:28:21.629
Hey.

1:28:28.803 --> 1:28:29.771
Mezzanine?

1:28:30.505 --> 1:28:31.706
What the fuck.

1:28:32.440 --> 1:28:33.374
What?

1:28:34.175 --> 1:28:35.510
That medicine.

1:28:35.610 --> 1:28:36.778
Oh...

1:28:36.844 --> 1:28:38.780
You nervous Nellie,
I got stuff to do.

1:28:43.651 --> 1:28:45.386
Hey, hey, come here.

1:28:45.486 --> 1:28:47.188
I want to show you something.

1:28:55.063 --> 1:28:57.498
Holy shit. JBLs.

1:28:59.867 --> 1:29:02.203
A pair of them are yours
to take home.

1:29:03.071 --> 1:29:05.239
Yeah, well, they're hot.

1:29:05.340 --> 1:29:06.708
Eh, fell off a truck.

1:29:07.508 --> 1:29:08.910
Far out, man.

1:29:11.212 --> 1:29:13.014
Oh!

1:29:13.081 --> 1:29:14.148
Ten-inch woofers.

1:29:17.185 --> 1:29:18.519
I want to go to college.

1:29:18.586 --> 1:29:20.254
I can't get caught
with shit like this.

1:29:20.355 --> 1:29:22.090
Okay, my friend Hesh...

1:29:22.190 --> 1:29:25.259
says only goys
and children pay retail.

1:29:25.360 --> 1:29:28.262
This isn't wholesale,
it's totally on the arm.

1:29:31.532 --> 1:29:33.201
Look...

1:29:33.267 --> 1:29:36.938
You want to be a civilian,
I appreciate that.
I'm all for it.

1:29:37.038 --> 1:29:39.207
But pay attention to me
for once, okay?

1:29:39.273 --> 1:29:41.008
You take the speakers, right?

1:29:41.075 --> 1:29:44.579
At the same time,
you promise yourself
these speakers are it.

1:29:44.679 --> 1:29:46.247
Now, you say to yourself,

1:29:46.347 --> 1:29:48.583
"This is the last time
I'm ever gonna
steal something."

1:29:48.683 --> 1:29:50.017
And you stick to it.

1:29:52.754 --> 1:29:54.088
It's that simple.

1:30:13.074 --> 1:30:14.942
-

1:30:17.979 --> 1:30:20.715
Maybe... Maybe
I should get on top.

1:30:35.163 --> 1:30:36.164
Agh!

1:30:36.264 --> 1:30:39.834
Fucking Dickie Moltisanti!

1:30:44.105 --> 1:30:45.907
It's more than a month now!

1:30:45.973 --> 1:30:47.575
For God's sake, Corrado.

1:30:47.642 --> 1:30:50.511
He didn't push you
down the stairs,
you slipped.

1:30:50.611 --> 1:30:52.580
He got a good laugh
out of it, though.

1:30:57.819 --> 1:30:59.854
Any excuse not to fuck.

1:31:04.625 --> 1:31:06.360
They don't vote
the motherfucker
out of the White House,

1:31:06.461 --> 1:31:09.030
somebody gonna
assassinate his lying ass.

1:31:09.130 --> 1:31:11.165
Azalea, you got it!

1:31:12.967 --> 1:31:14.769
Say, hey!

1:31:14.836 --> 1:31:17.472
There's my farm boy
from the Garden State.

1:31:17.538 --> 1:31:19.040
-Where's my tomatoes?

1:31:19.140 --> 1:31:20.541
Brought you collard greens.

1:31:20.641 --> 1:31:23.010
Ah, now you talkin'.

1:31:24.879 --> 1:31:25.947
Sit down.

1:31:26.013 --> 1:31:28.616
Have a hot chocolate
and Baileys.

1:31:28.683 --> 1:31:29.817
So, we square?

1:31:29.884 --> 1:31:31.819
Ooh, Chanel.

1:31:37.124 --> 1:31:37.892
Small bills.

1:31:37.992 --> 1:31:39.293
You're doing good.

1:31:39.360 --> 1:31:40.895
Soon I'll be in
the stratosphere with you.

1:31:40.995 --> 1:31:42.363
Call me Buzz Aldrin.

1:31:42.463 --> 1:31:45.132
Well, Buzz,
gonna hype you again.

1:31:45.199 --> 1:31:46.868
State lottery's coming.

1:31:46.968 --> 1:31:49.904
Your woman's not gonna be
wearing French footwear
very long.

1:31:50.004 --> 1:31:51.539
Now, with smack,

1:31:51.639 --> 1:31:54.809
you got white kids coming in
from Long Island, New Jersey,

1:31:54.876 --> 1:31:56.978
Westchester
to the East Village,

1:31:57.044 --> 1:32:00.348
paying 30 bucks to
stick their arm in a hole.

1:32:00.414 --> 1:32:04.218
Invisible person
on the other side
finds a vein,

1:32:04.318 --> 1:32:05.553
shoots 'em up...

1:32:07.421 --> 1:32:09.223
Should tell you something
about the future.

1:32:09.323 --> 1:32:11.726
You make a good point.
We'll talk.

1:32:11.826 --> 1:32:12.660
Thanks.

1:32:15.663 --> 1:32:17.331
This week I gotta...

1:32:17.398 --> 1:32:21.202
gotta do something about
this guinea motherfucker
or he'll do me.

1:32:21.269 --> 1:32:23.037
Ah, DiMeo?

1:32:23.104 --> 1:32:25.072
Nah, Dickie Moltisanti.

1:32:26.607 --> 1:32:29.076
Controls the numbers,
whole rest of Newark.

1:32:29.176 --> 1:32:31.445
You maybe need
an assist on the play?

1:32:34.248 --> 1:32:36.784
Why would you want
to do that for me?

1:32:36.884 --> 1:32:40.021
I got my own issues
with the Five Families.

1:32:40.087 --> 1:32:41.889
I appreciate it, Frank, but...

1:32:42.957 --> 1:32:45.126
Terms of the community.

1:32:45.226 --> 1:32:47.028
I'd better do this myself.

1:32:48.763 --> 1:32:50.097
Darryl.

1:32:56.804 --> 1:32:58.539
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1:33:14.655 --> 1:33:19.327
in the slipstream

1:33:19.427 --> 1:33:22.763
of your dream

1:33:24.832 --> 1:33:28.436
steel rims crack

1:33:28.502 --> 1:33:32.340
in the back roads stop

1:34:03.504 --> 1:34:05.373
I'm so hungry.

1:34:07.642 --> 1:34:10.011
I got news.

1:34:10.111 --> 1:34:13.481
That beauty parlor?
I took it over.

1:34:15.616 --> 1:34:17.018
For me?

1:34:17.118 --> 1:34:19.020
We'll be partners.

1:34:19.120 --> 1:34:20.788
It'll be in my name,
but you'll run it.

1:34:20.855 --> 1:34:23.391
Exactly how you want it.
I'll be hands off.

1:34:35.503 --> 1:34:38.806
in the slipstream

1:34:40.875 --> 1:34:44.211
of your dream

1:34:44.311 --> 1:34:47.381
in the back roads stop

1:35:23.384 --> 1:35:26.353
Hey,
what did the bartender say
when the horse came in?

1:35:26.420 --> 1:35:27.755
"Why the long face?"

1:35:29.356 --> 1:35:30.725
You told me that
a million times.

1:35:30.791 --> 1:35:33.728
Yeah, so?
Why the long face?

1:35:35.362 --> 1:35:37.031
I'm all, uh...

1:35:37.765 --> 1:35:39.433
intronata.

1:35:39.533 --> 1:35:42.103
You're mixed up? Well,
what are you mixed up about?

1:35:43.804 --> 1:35:45.473
So many things.

1:35:45.573 --> 1:35:48.109
Ten minutes ago, you were
laughing like an idiot.
What did I do?

1:35:49.577 --> 1:35:51.412
The beauty parlor.

1:35:51.479 --> 1:35:52.480
The beaut--

1:35:52.580 --> 1:35:54.381
I thought that's
what you wanted.

1:35:54.448 --> 1:35:56.817
More than anything.

1:35:56.917 --> 1:35:59.420
But now we partners
in business.

1:35:59.487 --> 1:36:01.322
It's like a marriage.

1:36:04.425 --> 1:36:07.128
I'm alone so much.

1:36:09.563 --> 1:36:11.065
I get lonely.

1:36:13.167 --> 1:36:15.169
Maybe you didn't
love me anymore.

1:36:15.269 --> 1:36:17.271
Hey, if I don't
love you anymore,

1:36:17.338 --> 1:36:19.073
you won't mistake it
for a maybe.

1:36:22.977 --> 1:36:25.112
Someone else came along.

1:36:30.651 --> 1:36:32.653
I said yes.

1:36:35.289 --> 1:36:36.290
Who?

1:36:38.125 --> 1:36:39.794
Don't make me say.

1:36:41.529 --> 1:36:44.465
What, you said,
"Yes, come fuck me?"

1:36:44.532 --> 1:36:46.801
Is that what
you're trying to say?
What else, yes?

1:36:46.867 --> 1:36:49.537
It didn't mean
anything, Dickie.

1:36:49.637 --> 1:36:51.305
-I love you!
-How many times?

1:36:51.372 --> 1:36:52.473
I don't know.

1:36:52.540 --> 1:36:54.008
You don't know?

1:36:54.108 --> 1:36:55.843
So many times
you can't remember?
Who was he?

1:36:55.943 --> 1:36:57.711
-I doesn't matter, it's over!
-Who was he?

1:36:57.812 --> 1:37:00.014
-I can't!
-Tell me! Fucking tell me.

1:37:00.114 --> 1:37:01.282
Promise you won't hurt him!

1:37:01.348 --> 1:37:02.650
I don't promise anything,

1:37:02.716 --> 1:37:03.984
but you don't tell me,
it's gonna be worse.

1:37:06.120 --> 1:37:07.154
Harold.

1:37:26.340 --> 1:37:28.242
You fucked that
murdering nigger?

1:37:28.342 --> 1:37:30.511
But I don't
love him, Dickie!

1:37:30.578 --> 1:37:33.347
I love you! Please! Don't!

1:37:34.148 --> 1:37:37.084
No, please! No! No!

1:38:12.953 --> 1:38:13.921
Ah!

1:39:06.440 --> 1:39:09.576
a girl like you

1:39:19.286 --> 1:39:22.856
a girl like you

1:39:28.862 --> 1:39:32.299
One thing
I still miss at Christmas...

1:39:32.366 --> 1:39:35.836
The Seven Fishes.
My wife used to make it.

1:39:35.936 --> 1:39:38.138
And tripe, too.

1:39:38.205 --> 1:39:42.776
She could make
those two things,
out of this world.

1:39:42.843 --> 1:39:47.114
You celebrate Christmas
with your  goomar,
or you stick around home?

1:39:48.315 --> 1:39:50.050
What makes you ask?

1:39:50.150 --> 1:39:53.387
I just remember,
with my girlfriend,
it was always a big argument.

1:39:56.957 --> 1:39:58.158
She died.

1:40:01.328 --> 1:40:02.830
So young.

1:40:04.898 --> 1:40:06.533
What happened?

1:40:07.401 --> 1:40:08.702
Pneumonia.

1:40:09.336 --> 1:40:10.971
Pneumonia?

1:40:11.038 --> 1:40:15.242
She had weak lungs,
from growing up
on the other side.

1:40:16.677 --> 1:40:18.379
Fucked up doctors...

1:40:20.848 --> 1:40:23.150
So much tragedy
in your life.

1:40:24.351 --> 1:40:27.021
Your father, your mistress...

1:40:28.422 --> 1:40:30.257
I don't even have
a picture of her.

1:40:36.063 --> 1:40:37.931
You know, I... I try so hard.

1:40:40.701 --> 1:40:42.669
What kind of God, huh?

1:40:46.707 --> 1:40:49.376
I go to church
when Joanne wants.

1:40:49.443 --> 1:40:51.678
I try to set an example
for my nephew,

1:40:51.745 --> 1:40:52.713
I come see you...

1:40:52.780 --> 1:40:54.515
I do all kinds of good things.

1:40:56.550 --> 1:40:58.919
You know the Christmas song,
"My Favorite Things"?

1:40:59.787 --> 1:41:00.721
Yeah.

1:41:02.022 --> 1:41:05.292
Maybe some of the things
you choose to do...

1:41:06.193 --> 1:41:07.761
aren't God's favorite.

1:41:10.531 --> 1:41:12.599
What are you trying to say?

1:41:14.068 --> 1:41:17.538
What do I know?
I'm a murderer.

1:41:23.077 --> 1:41:25.479
As far as your nephew goes...

1:41:25.579 --> 1:41:29.883
may I make a brief suggestion
for a nice Christmas present
you could give him?

1:41:33.754 --> 1:41:35.055
I'm listening.

1:41:36.924 --> 1:41:38.792
Stay out of his life.

1:41:50.504 --> 1:41:51.672
It's damaged.

1:41:51.772 --> 1:41:53.440
And you're out of line
with your prices.

1:42:23.470 --> 1:42:24.805
Who is this?

1:42:24.872 --> 1:42:27.674
Hey, Uncle Dick, it's Tony.
How's it going?

1:42:29.510 --> 1:42:31.044
There's a party tonight,
and I was wondering

1:42:31.145 --> 1:42:33.447
if we could get
a couple cases
of Rolling Rock?

1:42:34.715 --> 1:42:35.883
Uncle Dick?

1:42:38.886 --> 1:42:39.987
Uncle Dick?

1:42:41.054 --> 1:42:41.889
Hello?

1:42:44.825 --> 1:42:46.727
There's something wrong
with his phone.

1:42:46.827 --> 1:42:48.996
Your ass. Same as last time.

1:42:50.564 --> 1:42:52.399
It doesn't have to be
Rolling Rock.

1:42:52.499 --> 1:42:53.834
Does he know that?

1:42:53.901 --> 1:42:56.303
It's not about
the fucking name brand.

1:42:57.204 --> 1:42:58.639
Carmela, you got a dime?

1:43:14.087 --> 1:43:14.988
Hello?

1:43:15.055 --> 1:43:17.391
Hey, Aunt Jo. It's Tony.

1:43:17.491 --> 1:43:18.892
Can I speak to Uncle Dick?

1:43:20.527 --> 1:43:22.196
I haven't seen him today.

1:43:22.262 --> 1:43:23.330
Yeah?

1:43:25.666 --> 1:43:27.201
Well, how's Christopher?

1:43:29.269 --> 1:43:31.205
You know, the colic?

1:43:31.271 --> 1:43:33.707
For my money,
you kids shouldn't be
drinking at your age.

1:43:33.774 --> 1:43:35.909
Give me
the goddamn phone.

1:43:44.117 --> 1:43:47.354
Fuck. Hey, Joe Jerk-off.

1:43:51.592 --> 1:43:53.026
What'd you say?

1:43:53.093 --> 1:43:54.728
I said, hey, Joe Jerk...

1:43:54.795 --> 1:43:55.762
Your sister's twat!

1:43:55.862 --> 1:43:56.797
What?

1:43:58.398 --> 1:43:59.266
Stop it!

1:44:01.068 --> 1:44:01.935
Stop it!

1:44:16.450 --> 1:44:17.818
What do you got for us?

1:44:17.918 --> 1:44:20.153
It's what I told you,
furniture. Ethan Allen.

1:44:20.254 --> 1:44:23.056
Dinette sets
and, uh, TV trays.

1:44:23.991 --> 1:44:25.459
TV trays?

1:44:25.559 --> 1:44:26.893
I didn't argue.

1:44:26.960 --> 1:44:29.830
-Mmm.
-Fucking truck's
not gonna unload itself.

1:44:33.267 --> 1:44:34.568
I'll let him know.

1:44:45.612 --> 1:44:47.748
Hey, Sil, I need to talk
to my Uncle Dickie.

1:44:48.915 --> 1:44:51.118
He's not here.

1:44:51.184 --> 1:44:52.286
His car's here.

1:44:53.020 --> 1:44:54.354
Battery's dead.

1:44:56.790 --> 1:44:58.792
You know where he is?

1:44:58.859 --> 1:45:00.694
Who am I, Rand McNally?

1:45:06.033 --> 1:45:07.801
Okay, well...

1:45:07.868 --> 1:45:09.303
Merry Christmas, Sil.

1:45:11.938 --> 1:45:13.140
You too, kid.

1:45:24.484 --> 1:45:29.856
Carmine spotted Harold,
Rockhaven Motel,
down on 46th.

1:45:33.160 --> 1:45:34.494
Well,
we'll do it tomorrow.

1:45:35.996 --> 1:45:38.165
I'll pick you up at 10:00
at the Pork Store.

1:45:42.402 --> 1:45:45.305
It's the kid again.
I told him you're not here.

1:45:48.041 --> 1:45:49.543
Turn the lights out.

1:45:51.178 --> 1:45:53.146
But the guys,
they're still unloading.

1:46:39.459 --> 1:46:40.727
You know...

1:47:28.275 --> 1:47:29.476
The fuck are you doing?

1:47:29.576 --> 1:47:31.178
I don't want these!

1:47:37.317 --> 1:47:40.153
Oh! That was a gift!

1:47:40.253 --> 1:47:41.254
You take 'em!

1:47:41.321 --> 1:47:43.123
I don't want
any part of this!

1:47:43.190 --> 1:47:45.158
None of it! I don't
want any part of this!

1:47:45.258 --> 1:47:47.994
Huh?
What "this"?

1:47:50.530 --> 1:47:51.865
What "this"?

1:47:58.605 --> 1:48:00.040
Night, Dick.

1:48:09.015 --> 1:48:10.383
Dick...

1:48:10.484 --> 1:48:13.520
The kid. I don't know
what happened with you two.

1:48:14.488 --> 1:48:16.223
But he worships you.

1:48:16.323 --> 1:48:17.958
He's got so much potential.

1:48:18.024 --> 1:48:21.294
Anthony, with that
loony tune of a mother.

1:48:21.361 --> 1:48:24.231
Johnny, who's in line
for a personality transplant--

1:48:24.331 --> 1:48:26.032
-What, I'm some kind
of example?
-What can I tell you?

1:48:26.132 --> 1:48:27.400
You're his best shot.

1:48:27.501 --> 1:48:29.669
Ah, I should never
have let this happen.

1:48:31.137 --> 1:48:32.239
Get in close.

1:48:32.339 --> 1:48:34.307
Dick, he misses you.

1:48:37.177 --> 1:48:38.011
What?

1:48:40.881 --> 1:48:41.748
Nothing.

1:48:45.886 --> 1:48:46.887
Actually...

1:48:48.355 --> 1:48:49.489
that's it.

1:48:56.029 --> 1:48:57.063
Nothing.

1:48:59.499 --> 1:49:01.034
I'm not sure I follow.

1:49:02.536 --> 1:49:03.837
Yeah, well.

1:49:04.437 --> 1:49:05.372
Okay.

1:49:07.040 --> 1:49:09.709
I know I shouldn't
say this, but...

1:49:09.776 --> 1:49:12.112
Anthony, he could
end up somewhere.

1:49:12.212 --> 1:49:13.747
Be on this thing of ours, even.

1:49:25.725 --> 1:49:27.694
Tell him Holsten's, tomorrow.

1:49:27.761 --> 1:49:30.263
-There you go.
-Let me finish,
for Christ's sake!

1:49:33.300 --> 1:49:35.368
9:00 a.m. No later.

1:49:36.403 --> 1:49:37.470
This is good.

1:49:37.571 --> 1:49:38.605
Okay.

1:49:38.705 --> 1:49:40.373
-It's all right, but it--
-Okay!

1:49:40.440 --> 1:49:41.775
It's over, go home.

1:49:43.743 --> 1:49:45.078
The fuck am I doing?

1:49:46.112 --> 1:49:47.414
This one's yours.

1:50:52.178 --> 1:50:53.313
Help!

1:50:54.447 --> 1:50:55.515
My God!

1:50:56.349 --> 1:50:58.718
Mrs. Moltisanti!

1:51:18.672 --> 1:51:20.006
Yeah?

1:51:20.073 --> 1:51:21.241
It's done.

1:52:10.757 --> 1:52:16.296
to Christmas?

1:52:16.396 --> 1:52:21.534
way of living?

1:52:23.603 --> 1:52:28.441
to the giving

1:52:35.482 --> 1:52:36.783
Jun'.

1:52:36.883 --> 1:52:39.986
to Christmas?

1:52:41.488 --> 1:52:48.161
and left no traces...

1:52:48.261 --> 1:52:54.267
You know, they found
a couple bottles of that Elavil
in his coat pocket.

1:52:54.334 --> 1:52:55.635
Oh.

1:52:57.771 --> 1:53:00.907
I used to think
Dickie was so strong.

1:53:00.974 --> 1:53:03.743
It shows you never
know about people.

1:53:12.285 --> 1:53:14.954
God, he was
my favorite uncle.

1:53:17.323 --> 1:53:20.360
Remember when he used
to take us to the movies?

1:53:20.460 --> 1:53:22.629
Ones Mom
wouldn't let us go to.

1:53:54.994 --> 1:53:58.198
That's the guy,
my uncle Tony.

1:53:58.298 --> 1:54:00.567
The guy I went to hell for.

1:54:05.505 --> 1:54:10.210
you'd be the chosen one

1:54:10.310 --> 1:54:14.080
"you're one in a million,
you got to burn to shine"

1:54:14.180 --> 1:54:17.250
Kevin, quit bouncing
that ball.

1:54:17.350 --> 1:54:19.085
Go do something useful, man.

1:54:25.225 --> 1:54:27.060
Morning.

1:54:27.160 --> 1:54:31.764
about right and wrong

1:54:31.865 --> 1:54:34.901
but you're looking good, baby

1:54:35.001 --> 1:54:36.903
you're a-feelin' fine

1:54:38.605 --> 1:54:42.175
with a blue moon in your eyes

1:54:45.612 --> 1:54:49.749
-
in your eyes

1:54:53.219 --> 1:54:56.422
you woke up this mornin'

1:54:56.522 --> 1:54:58.524
upside down

1:54:58.591 --> 1:55:00.960
things ain't been the same

1:55:01.060 --> 1:55:03.963
walked into town

1:55:04.063 --> 1:55:06.466
but you're one in a million

1:55:06.566 --> 1:55:09.269
shotgun shine

1:55:10.970 --> 1:55:14.540
with a blue moon in your eyes

1:55:28.488 --> 1:55:32.725
you wanna be the chosen one

1:55:34.761 --> 1:55:37.230
help yourself, yeah

1:56:01.788 --> 1:56:05.625
Santa Susannah

1:56:05.692 --> 1:56:09.529
Santa Copelia

1:56:09.629 --> 1:56:13.433
Mary Angelica

1:56:13.499 --> 1:56:17.203
Frater Pietro

1:56:21.140 --> 1:56:27.814
Vladimir and all the rest

1:56:31.651 --> 1:56:39.058
is placed upon the steps
and a baby cries

1:56:39.158 --> 1:56:44.030
the church bells
start to ring

1:56:48.167 --> 1:56:54.140
the body settles in

1:56:54.207 --> 1:56:58.311
a mother sing

1:57:00.813 --> 1:57:08.154
then the other
as you step out on the road

1:57:13.393 --> 1:57:17.096
How much?

1:57:17.196 --> 1:57:23.736
and how far
and how many times

1:57:31.711 --> 1:57:39.352
Calling all angels

1:57:39.419 --> 1:57:46.426
Don't leave me alone

1:58:07.113 --> 1:58:11.818
you gaze upon the sunset

1:58:11.918 --> 1:58:16.055
and intensity

1:58:23.396 --> 1:58:26.065
crack the code

1:58:26.132 --> 1:58:29.669
finally understand

1:58:37.276 --> 1:58:41.347
trade in all

1:58:41.447 --> 1:58:47.520
and suffering?

1:59:21.487 --> 1:59:25.525
Calling all angels

1:59:25.625 --> 1:59:29.562
Calling all angels
