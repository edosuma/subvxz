00:04.640 --> 00:07.559
I don't know why your mum wouldn't
like me. I'm your best friend.

00:07.560 --> 00:09.399
- You trashed her house.
- I didn't do it.

00:09.400 --> 00:11.479
I was just there when it happened.

00:11.856 --> 00:13.639
I didn't get you in too
much trouble, did I?

00:13.683 --> 00:15.842
Well, I'm too old to be
grounded, but she's not happy.

00:16.396 --> 00:17.586
- Should I make her a present?
- No, no, no.

00:17.611 --> 00:19.890
If you want to get back in her good
books, and mine, actually,

00:19.915 --> 00:21.554
start being more professional.

00:21.579 --> 00:23.218
Em!

00:23.929 --> 00:25.801
Sorry. Professional. Got it.

00:26.834 --> 00:28.798
What if I made you guys one of
those jars with the coloured sand?

00:28.823 --> 00:30.812
No, no, no. Em, work stuff.

00:32.646 --> 00:35.265
There's still nothing. How
long till they move out?

00:37.265 --> 00:39.066
The tenants.

00:39.098 --> 00:40.577
Ridge Point Road.

00:40.578 --> 00:41.634
Oh, sorry.

00:41.659 --> 00:43.794
I was thinking about whether painted
wooden spoons might be a good gift.

00:43.819 --> 00:46.333
No, it's a terrible gift. You
can't use them as spoons anymore.

00:46.358 --> 00:48.691
Um, eight days till they move out.

00:48.853 --> 00:50.333
Right.

00:51.454 --> 00:55.454
Mrs Marsh, have we had any enquiries
about Ridge Point Road yet?

00:56.991 --> 00:58.233
Oh, shit.

00:58.258 --> 01:00.555
Can't it just be empty for a bit?

01:01.111 --> 01:03.573
If it wasn't Mum's property,
yes, but we need the rent money.

01:03.574 --> 01:06.653
Well, someone will turn up.
Eight days is ages.

01:06.654 --> 01:09.533
Yeah. I was hoping Jim and Ryan
would stay in there forever.

01:09.534 --> 01:11.573
They're polite, tidy,
pay their rent on time.

01:11.574 --> 01:13.373
- Why don't you marry them?
- I will.

01:13.374 --> 01:14.853
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

01:14.854 --> 01:16.333
- When's the wedding?
- Tomorrow.

01:16.334 --> 01:18.533
Emma, there's someone here to see you.

01:18.534 --> 01:20.173
Really?

01:20.174 --> 01:23.093
Probably a sweet new tenant,
here to sign a long-term lease

01:23.094 --> 01:25.253
and give me a thousand dollars
for being a hot piece of ass.

01:25.254 --> 01:26.102
Probably.

01:26.127 --> 01:27.607
He says he's your husband.

01:32.614 --> 01:33.666
Fuck.

01:35.000 --> 01:41.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

02:14.924 --> 02:16.403
- Is he still out there?
- Yeah.

02:16.404 --> 02:18.683
You just said, "Daniel, my
chambers", and pulled me in here.

02:18.684 --> 02:20.803
Why today? Why can't he just live
in a cave and never come out?

02:20.804 --> 02:22.283
Well, isn't this what you wanted?

02:22.284 --> 02:23.763
For him to come and beg for you back?

02:23.764 --> 02:25.603
No, I'm supposed to be looking
beautiful and prepared

02:25.604 --> 02:27.083
and together and tall when he turns up.

02:27.084 --> 02:28.563
- But I left my script at home.
- Your script?

02:28.564 --> 02:30.123
You know, it's just a
few dot points, ideas,

02:30.124 --> 02:31.683
things that I might say
if he ever turns up.

02:31.684 --> 02:34.403
And I can't remember any of it.
I think "You wish" was in there.

02:34.404 --> 02:36.203
But I can't remember what
that was an answer to.

02:36.204 --> 02:38.923
I almost hugged him. When I saw him,
I had an urge to hug him.

02:38.924 --> 02:40.763
- What do I do?
- Well...

02:40.764 --> 02:42.963
do you want me to get rid of him?

02:42.964 --> 02:44.283
No.

02:44.284 --> 02:46.163
Good, because I don't know
how I was going to do that.

02:46.164 --> 02:48.563
How do I look? Not that it matters.

02:48.564 --> 02:51.563
- No, it doesn't matter.
- But?

02:51.564 --> 02:53.839
- Oh, uh, fine.
- You're terrible at this.

02:53.864 --> 02:54.990
Sorry.

03:00.884 --> 03:03.404
Emma. Hello.

03:05.524 --> 03:06.926
Hello.

03:08.884 --> 03:09.989
Hi.

03:12.524 --> 03:15.163
Is there somewhere we can
talk in, uh, private?

03:15.164 --> 03:16.483
What for?

03:16.484 --> 03:19.403
Well, obviously, we need to
talk about what happened.

03:20.107 --> 03:22.329
- Hi. Phil.
- Hello.

03:22.354 --> 03:24.913
You've refused to answer my calls.
You left me no choice.

03:24.914 --> 03:27.073
Not work calls. They're
talking about something else.

03:27.074 --> 03:29.113
Yeah, that's all right.
I can come back at a different time.

03:29.114 --> 03:31.673
You know why I'm here...
When we were married...

03:31.674 --> 03:34.755
I'm interested in buying
the house at 64 Hurtnall Road.

03:34.780 --> 03:36.419
Okay, sorry, what was the address?

03:36.420 --> 03:38.299
- 64 Hurtnall Road...
- We always had our problems...

03:38.300 --> 03:40.539
- Hurtnall Road. Got it.
- Josh? Do you take Josh?

03:40.540 --> 03:42.699
Oh, see, it's difficult
to recognise your face

03:42.700 --> 03:44.499
because last time I saw you
it was the back of your head

03:44.500 --> 03:46.499
walking away from our
honeymoon without me.

03:46.500 --> 03:48.219
Em, please, do you know what
it took for me to come here?

03:48.220 --> 03:50.139
- Phil, I can't seem to find it...
- An hour and a half flight?

03:50.140 --> 03:51.939
Would it be better if I
came back at another time?

03:51.940 --> 03:54.179
- I came here to talk about...
- No, no, no. I can help you.

03:54.180 --> 03:56.139
Guys, you obviously
have a lot to discuss,

03:56.140 --> 03:58.107
so can you take it outside, please?

04:13.940 --> 04:16.459
- When are you going to do it?
- Do what?

04:16.459 --> 04:17.845
- Yell.
- Yell?

04:17.877 --> 04:20.397
Why would I yell? And in public?
That'd be very immature.

04:21.716 --> 04:23.316
This isn't really that public.

04:23.317 --> 04:25.597
What, do five people
and a duck live here?

04:28.037 --> 04:30.996
Just yell. You know you want to.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.676
So what can I do for you?

04:34.447 --> 04:35.495
Okay.

04:39.197 --> 04:41.596
- I don't know where to start.
- Yes.

04:42.628 --> 04:46.028
- Now I've thought about this a lot.
- Yes.

04:46.197 --> 04:49.356
I had to come find you. We
couldn't leave it like that.

04:50.207 --> 04:52.713
- Now, I know now I did the right...
- You made a mistake.

04:54.136 --> 04:55.237
Oh.

04:56.797 --> 04:59.117
Oh, no, I don't think we
should get back together.

05:03.156 --> 05:04.396
Right, um...

05:04.397 --> 05:08.836
Sorry about that, Phil.
Hurtnall... Hurtnall Road.

05:08.837 --> 05:12.276
I can't actually seem to find it listed.

05:12.277 --> 05:15.556
- It might not be for sale.
- I'm sorry?

05:15.557 --> 05:19.156
Yeah, I drive past it quite a
bit and I like the look of it.

05:19.157 --> 05:23.396
Okay. Phil, I can't sell you
a house that's not for sale.

05:23.397 --> 05:26.796
Well, doesn't everything have a price?

05:26.797 --> 05:28.876
Well...

05:29.036 --> 05:32.555
I mean, um, I can make an
enquiry for you, or...?

05:32.999 --> 05:35.454
I know who lives there, if that'd help.

05:35.479 --> 05:36.690
But you haven't asked them?

05:37.598 --> 05:40.076
Rather leave it to the professionals.

05:40.077 --> 05:42.836
Just so I have this straight,
you're not here to win me back.

05:42.837 --> 05:44.876
It's time to be honest.
This is hard for me.

05:44.877 --> 05:46.996
- You can be intimidating.
- Hard for you?

05:46.997 --> 05:49.596
Intimidating? I am a smile with hair.

05:49.597 --> 05:52.236
Sorry, I'm just confused because
I thought you were embarrassed

05:52.237 --> 05:54.236
because I was pathetic
and stole a lobster.

05:54.237 --> 05:56.036
- I was angry.
- I was there.

05:56.037 --> 05:58.156
Look, the good news is, we're
through the worst part.

05:58.157 --> 06:00.796
You are not allowed to come here and
say things like, "The good news is".

06:00.797 --> 06:03.476
- What are you even doing here?
- I need you to forgive me.

06:03.477 --> 06:05.436
That's why I'm here. I need closure.

06:05.437 --> 06:07.676
- What?
- After what happened.

06:07.677 --> 06:10.196
Stop saying "what happened" like it
was some kind of natural disaster

06:10.197 --> 06:11.876
and not something that you did.

06:11.877 --> 06:13.916
- Okay, okay, after what I did...
- Yes.

06:13.917 --> 06:17.676
I just needed to make sense of it all.
In couples therapy.

06:17.677 --> 06:20.316
- In... what?
- For us.

06:20.317 --> 06:22.756
What do you mean, for us?
Did you go without me?

06:22.757 --> 06:24.956
Yeah, I played your part, too.
You had a voice.

06:24.957 --> 06:26.276
Oh!

06:26.712 --> 06:29.952
No, no, Frank, I'm not trying to
sell your house out from under you.

06:30.757 --> 06:33.076
Well, I don't think that
language is necessary.

06:33.526 --> 06:36.076
- He hung up.
- He was pretty mad, eh.

06:36.077 --> 06:38.436
Yeah, he was furious.
He doesn't want to sell.

06:38.437 --> 06:40.676
Phil, I do have some properties
in that price range.

06:40.677 --> 06:42.156
Nah, don't worry about it.

06:42.157 --> 06:44.236
I wasn't really interested
in that one, tell the truth.

06:44.237 --> 06:46.236
I just knew it'd piss
Frank off to ask him.

06:46.609 --> 06:48.516
- What?
- It's a joke.

06:48.517 --> 06:50.876
He's paranoid the whole town's
trying to get rid of him.

06:50.877 --> 06:53.277
I just like to stir the
pot every now and then.

06:54.597 --> 06:56.716
Do your own prank calls, Phil.

06:56.717 --> 06:58.756
- I need you to be adult about this!
- That's the problem, is it?

06:58.757 --> 06:59.917
Needing me to be an adult?

06:59.918 --> 07:01.916
Heaps of people don't know
what superannuation is, Josh.

07:01.917 --> 07:03.716
- It's planning for your future.
- 'Cause you know what?

07:03.717 --> 07:05.516
Actually, I've changed,
and you don't know me

07:05.517 --> 07:07.436
and I have a new job here
and I am professional

07:07.437 --> 07:09.299
and actually, I have to get back.

07:09.324 --> 07:10.436
Em. Em!

07:10.437 --> 07:13.317
I'm sorry for what happened, but you
have to realise it was for the best.

07:15.037 --> 07:17.556
Please. Just forgive me.

07:18.431 --> 07:20.248
It's important, for both of us.

07:21.915 --> 07:24.156
And I'm not leaving until you do.

07:25.585 --> 07:27.168
Well, then I guess you're not leaving.

07:35.192 --> 07:36.780
I need a watch.

07:36.805 --> 07:38.359
Did he do a good apology?

07:38.384 --> 07:39.867
Terrible. I need a watch.

07:39.899 --> 07:42.019
- Do you want to talk about it?
- No.

07:43.259 --> 07:45.138
Why aren't there any watches in here?

07:45.139 --> 07:47.338
Well, you've got a phone. Em, do
you want the rest of the day off?

07:47.339 --> 07:48.818
No, I want to do work.

07:48.819 --> 07:50.738
That tenancy, that...
Let's work on that.

07:50.739 --> 07:52.898
Well, we have. No one wants a
three-bedroom house right now.

07:52.899 --> 07:55.018
Well, let's... What if
these ones didn't move?

07:55.019 --> 07:57.858
Let's convince them to stay. No need
to find new tenants. Problem solved.

07:57.859 --> 07:59.898
- Well, yeah, but how?
- Well, can I meet them?

07:59.899 --> 08:01.218
Are we allowed to go see them?

08:01.219 --> 08:02.778
Well, it's a bit weird
to just pop round there.

08:02.779 --> 08:04.538
I mean, they're so clean,
they'd probably like....

08:04.539 --> 08:05.995
Okay, let's go. I'll drive.

08:22.819 --> 08:24.738
It's beautiful.

08:24.739 --> 08:27.343
Well, you'd think four years in a
place would leave more of a mark.

08:27.368 --> 08:29.859
These windows are so clean,
it's like they're not there.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.176
Huh!

08:32.318 --> 08:35.424
I bet you're going to miss this
place, unless you stay on.

08:35.448 --> 08:36.448
Subtle.

08:36.472 --> 08:38.422
Can I ask why you're moving?
Is it for work?

08:38.438 --> 08:41.518
No, our stuff's all online.
We can live anywhere.

08:41.519 --> 08:44.598
We'll be sad to leave, but
just time for a change.

08:44.599 --> 08:46.718
Yeah, a change is as good as a holiday.

08:46.719 --> 08:49.558
Well, not necessarily. I mean, you
might change into a werewolf.

08:49.559 --> 08:51.758
- Attack someone.
- Have you found somewhere else yet?

08:51.759 --> 08:55.358
Short answer is city. We'll figure
it out when we get there.

08:55.359 --> 08:57.638
Oh, I guess if you like
pollution or being mugged,

08:57.639 --> 08:59.198
then that is the place to go.

08:59.199 --> 09:01.159
Do you know, I was googling
heroin this morning...

09:07.840 --> 09:09.879
- I had them.
- Oh, the werewolf stuff? Perfect.

09:09.880 --> 09:11.879
Being unique and original is
still being professional.

09:11.880 --> 09:13.359
Yeah, as a personal challenge,

09:13.360 --> 09:15.879
let's not mention fictional monsters
anymore when talking to clients.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.679
If I think a longma is
going to close a deal...

09:17.680 --> 09:19.479
- A what?
- A longma.

09:19.480 --> 09:20.640
What's that?

09:20.665 --> 09:22.704
It's a horse with wings
that's covered in dragon scales.

09:22.729 --> 09:25.135
- So it's a dragon.
- No, it's a horse with dragon scales.

09:25.160 --> 09:27.519
If it can fly and it's got
dragon scales, it's a dragon.

09:27.520 --> 09:29.239
- It's got a horse's head.
- Why?

09:29.240 --> 09:30.720
Because it's a longma.

09:32.668 --> 09:33.640
Hey.

09:35.360 --> 09:36.959
- Josh, hi.
- Hey.

09:36.960 --> 09:38.880
- Still... still here?
- Yep.

09:40.040 --> 09:42.479
- Did you want to come in or...?
- Yeah.

09:42.480 --> 09:46.199
We'd love that, but it wouldn't be
conducive to the office environment.

09:46.200 --> 09:48.199
- Oh, I understand.
- But you can leave whenever you want.

09:48.200 --> 09:50.399
- You're really good at that.
- I'll stay. I'm not kidding, Em.

09:50.400 --> 09:53.440
Oh, sorry, I've gotta go to a meeting.

09:56.928 --> 09:58.679
How are you, Daniel?

09:58.680 --> 10:01.359
Yeah, yeah, yeah, pretty good.

10:01.360 --> 10:03.960
- You?
- Yeah, I'm okay.

10:05.320 --> 10:08.039
You, um, seen the trailer for...

10:08.364 --> 10:10.204
- Daniel!
- All the best.

10:17.080 --> 10:19.519
- He won't leave.
- I noticed.

10:19.520 --> 10:21.159
He won't leave until I forgive him.

10:21.160 --> 10:23.959
So I guess he's moved here.
Do not give him a job.

10:23.960 --> 10:26.239
- Don't you want to sort things out?
- Why should I?

10:26.240 --> 10:28.639
He doesn't want me back, and
he wants to be guilt-free as well.

10:28.640 --> 10:32.719
No. Now, we're busy. I'm busy.
These tenants.

10:32.720 --> 10:35.679
I want them to stay too, but they
already said it's time for a change.

10:35.680 --> 10:37.679
Their mouths said that,
but their eyes said,

10:37.680 --> 10:40.222
"Change is only one of several options."

10:40.317 --> 10:42.919
Okay, fine. Let's think about this.

10:42.920 --> 10:44.479
Why should they stay?

10:44.480 --> 10:46.999
Everyone has three main
sections, work, life, love.

10:47.000 --> 10:48.479
They've got love sorted.

10:48.480 --> 10:50.879
- Good for them.
- Work's not keeping them here.

10:50.880 --> 10:53.319
So it's life, which is
all the other stuff.

10:53.550 --> 10:57.018
We just remind them how great
living in Rosehaven is.

10:57.043 --> 10:59.362
I mean, they've loved it once,
they can love it again.

10:59.363 --> 11:01.602
- That's true. Sorry.
- They will love it again.

11:01.603 --> 11:03.083
You ruined that.

11:11.423 --> 11:14.222
- How far is it?
- It's just at the end of the street.

11:14.223 --> 11:15.703
I think, Em...

11:16.745 --> 11:20.424
if you really think about it, you'll
realise you're not mad at me.

11:20.449 --> 11:22.089
I'm not mad, I'm busy.

11:29.050 --> 11:30.770
Official real estate business.

11:32.703 --> 11:33.936
Sorry.

11:45.143 --> 11:47.120
Oh, hi.

11:47.866 --> 11:49.422
- Stacey?
- Hi.

11:49.423 --> 11:51.982
Hi. What are some cool
places to visit around here?

11:51.983 --> 11:54.822
Cool? Good luck. Everything's
pretty terrible.

11:54.823 --> 11:56.465
- Hm?
- Are you allowed to say that?

11:56.481 --> 11:59.116
Are you from Trip Advisor?

12:00.695 --> 12:02.346
That's everything.

12:05.163 --> 12:07.800
Um, do you have any recommendations?

12:07.801 --> 12:09.920
Well, are you into old prisons or places

12:09.921 --> 12:12.469
where we did really horrible
things to Aboriginal people?

12:12.652 --> 12:13.920
- No.
- No.

12:13.921 --> 12:16.440
Then it's pretty much craft or plants.

12:16.441 --> 12:18.600
Well, what about the rock
formation right outside of town?

12:18.601 --> 12:21.320
- That's over four million years old.
- It's no Great Barrier Reef.

12:21.321 --> 12:23.240
- What?
- Can you tell us more about it?

12:23.241 --> 12:24.281
Absolutely.

12:24.282 --> 12:25.920
It has an array of marine creatures

12:25.921 --> 12:28.320
that includes 600 types
of soft and hard coral

12:28.321 --> 12:29.960
- and more than 100 species of...
- No, no.

12:29.961 --> 12:31.800
Sorry, she meant the rock
formation, not the reef.

12:31.801 --> 12:34.400
I used to work there. It's so beautiful.

12:34.401 --> 12:36.280
Well, Tasmania's pretty
beautiful too, so...

12:36.281 --> 12:38.680
- Did you... Why would you leave?
- I followed a guy here.

12:38.705 --> 12:39.840
Yeah? No way. Me too.

12:39.841 --> 12:41.440
He just sits at home
getting workers' comp

12:41.441 --> 12:44.212
while I'm stuck here
peddling a lavender farm.

12:44.237 --> 12:45.914
Which is actually an excellent day out.

12:45.923 --> 12:47.562
You can't see it from outer space.

12:47.563 --> 12:49.089
There are a lot of cool things
you can't see from outer space.

12:49.114 --> 12:50.513
- Disneyland...
- This your boyfriend?

12:50.550 --> 12:52.710
Oh, no, we're just friends.
My husband's outside.

12:56.112 --> 12:58.229
- Right.
- Can I take some of those?

12:58.230 --> 13:00.830
- Go nuts.
- This is going to be perfect!

13:03.520 --> 13:05.320
You don't deserve to sit there.

13:18.445 --> 13:22.324
I finished that rainforest
puzzle you gave me. Two days.

13:22.325 --> 13:24.924
Mum treats relaxation as a competition.

13:24.925 --> 13:28.204
Can you get me another one?
Not as easy this time.

13:28.205 --> 13:31.404
I'll get you a 10,000-piece
one that's just sky.

13:31.405 --> 13:33.779
Emma, no craft at the table.

13:33.796 --> 13:36.595
- Oh, it's not craft, it's...
- Oh, and Gez from the Op Shop rang.

13:36.596 --> 13:38.595
She says you may have a stalker.

13:38.596 --> 13:40.155
That's my husband.

13:40.156 --> 13:41.875
Come to win you back?

13:41.876 --> 13:43.160
Not exactly.

13:44.002 --> 13:45.795
Let me give you some advice.

13:46.486 --> 13:48.836
You're responsible for
your own happiness.

13:51.780 --> 13:55.556
And never fight in my office
in front of a customer again.

14:01.396 --> 14:02.876
Is that from the Bible?

14:17.636 --> 14:19.995
Ah, here they are, the guests of honour.

14:19.996 --> 14:21.635
Oh, this is really kind of you.

14:21.636 --> 14:24.155
I don't think I've heard
of a real estate agent

14:24.156 --> 14:26.595
throwing a going away party
for their tenants before.

14:26.596 --> 14:28.795
- Oh, don't mention it.
- Nice banner.

14:28.796 --> 14:31.451
Thank you. Why don't you grab a drink?
We're going to start soon.

14:33.916 --> 14:36.675
This is going to be so great.
They're on the edge of staying.

14:36.676 --> 14:38.275
- I can feel it.
- Yeah.

14:38.276 --> 14:39.995
- Oh, good, Stacey's here.
- What?

14:39.996 --> 14:41.755
- Why?
- To talk about the town.

14:41.756 --> 14:43.355
She doesn't even like it here.

14:43.356 --> 14:44.835
- Hey.
- You made it!

14:44.836 --> 14:47.675
So I'm going to introduce you and
Daniel will work the PowerPoint.

14:47.676 --> 14:50.035
Feel free to throw in
your own knowledge.

14:50.036 --> 14:52.555
Anything you think could help.
Just keep it positive, remember?

14:52.556 --> 14:54.115
She can't be positive.

14:54.116 --> 14:55.915
Nestled in the picturesque
Tasmanian south,

14:55.916 --> 14:59.756
Rosehaven is a beautiful and welcoming
town with a fascinating history.

15:00.733 --> 15:03.412
I know the drill. Always
up for free beer.

15:03.413 --> 15:04.854
Daniel, get her a pint.

15:06.584 --> 15:08.373
I'm getting the cheapest one.

15:13.533 --> 15:16.332
Hello. Sorry. Can I have
everyone's attention?

15:16.333 --> 15:20.292
We are going to start now because
obviously we are here tonight

15:20.293 --> 15:23.332
to say goodbye to Jim and Ryan,

15:23.333 --> 15:27.253
and they will be saying goodbye
to Rosehaven, if they want.

15:28.773 --> 15:34.252
Anyway, um, a lot of people are
really going to miss Jim and Ryan,

15:34.253 --> 15:37.412
not least of all their
neighbours, like Tess.

15:37.413 --> 15:40.762
Tess, would you like to say
something to the guys?

15:41.756 --> 15:43.972
I saw you pick a plum off my tree once.

15:43.973 --> 15:45.533
I didn't mind.

15:47.173 --> 15:48.892
What community spirit!

15:48.893 --> 15:52.572
Thank you, Tess. And, uh, Tony.

15:52.573 --> 15:56.932
Oh, I mean, I bet you'll
miss old Tone, right, guys?

15:56.933 --> 16:00.292
Um, I don't think we ever formally met.

16:00.293 --> 16:03.612
Our houses are pretty far apart.

16:03.613 --> 16:06.692
Oh, I wave sometimes. You get home late.

16:07.430 --> 16:08.572
Okay!

16:08.573 --> 16:10.412
Thanks, Tone! What about Nancy?

16:10.413 --> 16:12.292
Where's Nancy? She's got some stories.

16:12.293 --> 16:13.772
CNN labelled the Great Barrier Reef

16:13.773 --> 16:15.732
one of the seven natural
wonders of the world.

16:15.733 --> 16:17.652
It has 1,500 different species of fish.

16:17.653 --> 16:19.452
Well, I hope climate
change kills them all.

16:19.453 --> 16:21.012
You take that back.

16:21.013 --> 16:22.932
Look, that big rock is
Gerald's Formation,

16:22.933 --> 16:24.412
and it's a slice of Earth's history.

16:24.413 --> 16:26.132
It'll still be there
long after we're gone.

16:26.133 --> 16:28.252
So I guess there'll be no one
around who gives a shit about it.

16:28.253 --> 16:30.812
- Just like now.
- You know what? Give me the script.

16:30.813 --> 16:32.052
Be my guest.

16:32.053 --> 16:33.173
Magical place.

16:33.174 --> 16:36.892
Please welcome your favourite
info booth Rosehaven expert,

16:36.893 --> 16:38.812
Stacey Walsh!

16:38.813 --> 16:40.652
Daniel McCallum!

16:43.773 --> 16:45.332
Hi. Thank you.

16:45.333 --> 16:49.012
I came back to
Rosehaven from the mainland

16:49.013 --> 16:51.332
- because...
- Couldn't hack it!

16:51.333 --> 16:53.773
this town holds a special
place in my heart.

16:57.693 --> 17:02.293
Rosehaven was founded in 1810, when
one settler, Frederick Rose...

17:03.693 --> 17:07.332
got separated from the main group
after a gust of wind took his hat.

17:07.333 --> 17:09.372
Yeah, I'm not sure how it works.

17:09.373 --> 17:11.571
- It dries slipperier, I guess.
- Hey.

17:11.573 --> 17:13.372
Damien, what are you doing here?

17:13.373 --> 17:15.132
Oh, Dave lost his keys
to the cellar, so...

17:15.133 --> 17:17.412
Oh, right. Well, hi.

17:17.413 --> 17:19.692
This is nice, isn't it? You've met.

17:19.693 --> 17:23.212
Yes, Damien was just talking
to me about anti-climb paint.

17:23.213 --> 17:24.732
Yeah.

17:24.733 --> 17:27.212
Well, I'm home tomorrow, Emma.

17:27.213 --> 17:29.572
Okay. That's nice.

17:29.573 --> 17:31.133
See ya, bro.

17:33.013 --> 17:34.572
He seems nice.

17:34.573 --> 17:36.732
- Yeah.
- Odd.

17:36.733 --> 17:38.693
- He's a hoarder.
- Mm.

17:40.373 --> 17:42.492
- Are you two seeing each other...
- I can do what I want.

17:42.493 --> 17:44.812
Yeah, I know you can, but I
should be able to as well.

17:44.813 --> 17:47.492
- I mean, clearly you've moved on.
- No, I haven't.

17:47.493 --> 17:49.372
And even if I had, it doesn't
make any difference.

17:49.373 --> 17:50.852
- Yes, it does.
- No, it doesn't.

17:50.853 --> 17:52.972
Do you know what, actually,
I've got to get... I've got work.

17:52.973 --> 17:55.692
Pretending to be mature is the most
immature thing you've ever done.

17:55.693 --> 17:58.452
Well, I'm not pretending,
so you can eat shit!

17:58.453 --> 18:00.212
Rosehaven's incredible rock formation,

18:00.213 --> 18:03.252
Gerald's Formation, just at
the outskirts of our town,

18:03.253 --> 18:05.252
is over four million years old.

18:05.253 --> 18:07.573
- It's no reef!
- Yeah, the reef can eat shit!

18:10.528 --> 18:14.412
Anyway, that is why I, Daniel
McCallum of McCallum Real Estate,

18:14.413 --> 18:18.733
open 9am to 5pm Monday to
Saturday, love Rosehaven.

18:22.493 --> 18:24.292
Thank you, Daniel.

18:24.293 --> 18:25.772
I'd just like to say,

18:25.773 --> 18:27.852
to me, Rosehaven is great
because of the people.

18:27.853 --> 18:30.852
So welcoming to new visitors
like me and my husband.

18:30.853 --> 18:33.652
You might not have met Josh yet,
but he lives here indefinitely.

18:33.653 --> 18:35.412
You won't let me go!

18:35.413 --> 18:37.732
Well, why don't we end it
there so you guys can talk?

18:37.733 --> 18:39.212
No, you're a part of this too, Daniel.

18:39.213 --> 18:40.892
- Here we go!
- I'm not.

18:40.893 --> 18:43.412
I could never get
between the two of you.

18:43.413 --> 18:45.932
- Em and I were never that close.
- We got married!

18:45.933 --> 18:47.412
We can have this conversation off stage.

18:47.413 --> 18:49.572
- And you ran off!
- Yeah, I know what I did was wrong!

18:49.573 --> 18:51.533
What am I supposed to do? Stay married?

18:54.035 --> 18:56.452
Hey, what you're doing
now is wrong too, mate.

18:56.453 --> 18:59.013
Em will forgive you when she's
ready, not when you are.

19:06.933 --> 19:09.332
Uh, that concludes the
presentation, everyone.

19:09.333 --> 19:11.772
That last part was... a sketch.

19:11.773 --> 19:13.652
Would Jim and Ryan like
to say a few words?

19:13.653 --> 19:15.613
- Let's wrap it up.
- Jim and Ryan.

19:19.502 --> 19:22.421
Uh, wow, that was very... passionate.

19:22.422 --> 19:24.901
Um, thank you very much.

19:24.902 --> 19:27.781
We've been overwhelmed by all the
love and support from the community,

19:27.782 --> 19:31.821
and Rosehaven's certainly a
very special place to live.

19:32.780 --> 19:33.802
And...

19:34.026 --> 19:35.946
We'll miss it very much.

19:43.417 --> 19:46.256
Well, thanks again. I should get going.

19:46.281 --> 19:48.080
Oh, did Ryan already leave?

19:48.081 --> 19:49.920
Yeah, yeah. He wasn't feeling too well.

19:49.921 --> 19:52.321
- Oh, no, that's no good.
- No, no, no, he's fine.

19:59.051 --> 20:00.636
Are you okay?

20:03.121 --> 20:05.664
I hate that he's here, but
I don't want him to go.

20:05.750 --> 20:07.230
Yeah.

20:08.041 --> 20:10.553
Socialising after a break-up is hard.

20:11.681 --> 20:13.600
Honestly, that's why Ryan left.

20:14.457 --> 20:15.708
What?

20:15.733 --> 20:18.372
- Yeah, we broke up.
- Tonight?

20:18.397 --> 20:22.596
No, no. No, a month-ish ago. That's
why we're moving out, you know.

20:22.669 --> 20:24.788
We just wanted to keep it private.

20:24.789 --> 20:28.188
I am so sorry. We've been
trying to get you to stay.

20:28.189 --> 20:30.068
Yeah, the banner clued us in.

20:30.069 --> 20:32.828
You should leave as quickly as possible.

20:32.829 --> 20:34.708
I don't know how you've
been able to live together

20:34.709 --> 20:36.268
when you've been broken
up this whole time.

20:36.293 --> 20:38.346
It's okay. There's still
a lot of love there.

20:38.423 --> 20:40.602
I mean, yeah, I'm sure there
is, but what kind of love?

20:40.603 --> 20:43.362
I mean, it changes when you
break up and you know,

20:43.363 --> 20:45.002
people break up for a reason.

20:45.003 --> 20:47.482
Yeah, a stupid reason, most of the time.

20:47.483 --> 20:50.522
No. It's important reasons.
You can't settle.

20:50.523 --> 20:53.242
- If there's something wrong...
- We should work it through, I know.

20:53.243 --> 20:55.482
- No, I mean...
- He's a great guy.

20:55.483 --> 20:57.642
- But there'll be someone else.
- Yeah, who's not him.

20:57.643 --> 20:58.723
Exactly!

20:59.262 --> 21:01.322
You're right. I'm going
to go talk to him.

21:01.648 --> 21:02.968
What? No.

21:28.533 --> 21:29.562
Hey.

21:30.477 --> 21:31.563
Hey.

21:34.523 --> 21:37.899
Em, I'm sorry for coming down
here and demanding anything.

21:38.906 --> 21:40.962
- I'll leave first thing tomorrow.
- No.

21:41.478 --> 21:43.122
You want me to stay?

21:43.123 --> 21:44.367
I don't know.

21:44.683 --> 21:46.642
If I forgive you and you go,

21:46.643 --> 21:49.219
then I'm just a woman in
a town for no reason.

21:51.083 --> 21:52.465
You have a reason.

21:53.083 --> 21:56.842
- It's one of the oldest rocks...
- We're just friends.

21:56.843 --> 21:58.522
- You know...
- I know, I know.

21:58.523 --> 22:01.042
But watching you today, you had purpose.

22:01.645 --> 22:02.843
You looked happy.

22:06.963 --> 22:08.763
What do we do?

22:11.563 --> 22:13.991
- Do you want to come back with me?
- What?

22:14.523 --> 22:17.042
Do you want to get back together?
Go back to Melbourne?

22:17.538 --> 22:21.322
Uh, I don't know. Um,
it's really sudden.

22:21.323 --> 22:22.842
You're going to make me say it.

22:22.843 --> 22:24.443
I thought you'd let
me not say it, but...

22:26.843 --> 22:29.083
I don't think you were
ever in love with me.

22:30.203 --> 22:32.779
It's okay. I know you
really wanted to be.

22:36.523 --> 22:38.653
And I'm sorry for the way it ended.

22:44.742 --> 22:45.963
I forgive you.

23:04.496 --> 23:06.122
- I'm proud of you.
- Mm.

23:06.123 --> 23:08.082
- I got you something.
- What?

23:08.083 --> 23:11.203
Well, I got it out of my bedroom, but
it should do for the time being.

23:17.163 --> 23:18.962
Is this crazy?

23:19.377 --> 23:20.976
I don't want him to die,

23:20.977 --> 23:24.178
but I never want to see or hear
anything about him ever again.

23:24.203 --> 23:25.202
No.

23:25.226 --> 23:28.305
Like, I don't want him to
die, just out of existence.

23:28.306 --> 23:30.665
- Okay, well, that's death.
- No, not death.

23:31.124 --> 23:33.964
Like, if someone teleports in
a movie, they're not dead.

23:33.989 --> 23:35.828
Yeah, but they reappear somewhere else.

23:35.829 --> 23:37.988
Well, that's... I want
him to go somewhere.

23:38.275 --> 23:40.465
Hey, how's it going?

23:40.474 --> 23:42.267
Good.

23:42.296 --> 23:44.415
Sorry to make more
paperwork for you guys,

23:44.415 --> 23:46.575
but we'd like to renew our lease.

23:48.215 --> 23:51.134
Yes. Great. Uh, no problem.

23:51.135 --> 23:54.134
Um, I will organise
that and be in touch.

23:54.135 --> 23:55.447
- Great.
- Great.

23:55.472 --> 23:56.812
- Cheers.
- Brilliant.

24:03.655 --> 24:07.134
- That is bull... shit.
- Em, it's great news.

24:07.135 --> 24:09.334
It has to work out for
everyone else, doesn't it?

24:09.335 --> 24:10.975
Yeah, and us in this scenario.

24:12.895 --> 24:15.094
So I guess we're celebrating
tonight, are we?

24:15.095 --> 24:20.162
- Uh... actually I was going to... um...
- What?

24:20.479 --> 24:23.294
- Nothing, I can cancel.
- What?

24:23.295 --> 24:25.948
I was going to, um, catch
up with Grace tonight.

24:30.935 --> 24:33.070
That's not a great look for customers.

24:33.379 --> 24:35.254
Yeah, why don't you just let me...

24:35.255 --> 24:38.174
Who still puts corks in wine? No!

24:38.175 --> 24:39.774
Come on!

24:39.775 --> 24:41.292
Ooh!

24:48.629 --> 24:52.294
- I heard what you did. Good job.
- Oh, thanks.

24:52.295 --> 24:53.796
I mean, they're good tenants.

25:03.095 --> 25:05.415
I wasn't talking about the tenants.

25:18.255 --> 25:20.655
Can I have some more?

25:27.655 --> 25:30.574
I am assuming you're here because
McCallum Real Estate is...

25:31.895 --> 25:33.100
We're gonna have to make some cuts.

25:33.115 --> 25:35.674
His mum is the reason you
guys are able to practice.

25:35.675 --> 25:39.634
McCallum Real Estate will no longer
sponsor the Rosehaven Ravens.

25:39.635 --> 25:41.114
- You did the right thing.
- Really?

25:41.115 --> 25:42.634
Because I thought I
just made 20 kids cry.

25:42.635 --> 25:47.075
Daniel, there's some people outside
who might want to talk to you.

25:54.575 --> 25:56.374
It's amazing, isn't it?

25:56.375 --> 25:57.935
It's very nice.

26:00.162 --> 26:01.614
Maybe if it had some
coral attached to it...

26:01.615 --> 26:02.805
I give up.
