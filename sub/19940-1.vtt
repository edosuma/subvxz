WEBVTT

00:08.960 --> 00:10.190
Shh!

00:11.360 --> 00:14.300
Woman: Who gives a toast
at her own wedding?

00:15.800 --> 00:16.970
I mean, who does that?

00:17.030 --> 00:18.200
Who stands in the middle
of a ballroom

00:18.270 --> 00:19.970
after three glasses
of champagne

00:20.040 --> 00:21.440
on a completely
empty stomach...

00:21.510 --> 00:23.040
and I mean completely empty

00:23.110 --> 00:24.510
because fitting
into this dress

00:24.570 --> 00:27.480
required no solid food
for three straight weeks.

00:27.540 --> 00:28.780
Who does that?

00:29.880 --> 00:30.810
I do.

00:36.750 --> 00:38.960
This day is perfect.

00:39.020 --> 00:40.320
It's like a dream...

00:40.390 --> 00:42.290
or a nightmare
if you're my father.

00:42.360 --> 00:43.860
"How much for the flowers?"

00:43.930 --> 00:45.160
"Who eats mushroom caps?"

00:45.230 --> 00:46.660
"Do the caterers have any idea

00:46.730 --> 00:48.600
what the Jews just went
through a few years ago?"

00:48.670 --> 00:50.400
Two cakes,
one for eating.

00:50.470 --> 00:52.240
We're very happy.

00:52.300 --> 00:54.900
This day has been
long in planning.

00:54.970 --> 00:56.570
Anyone who knows me
knows I plan.

00:56.640 --> 00:59.880
At 6 I decided
Russian literature
would be my major.

00:59.940 --> 01:02.150
At 12 I found
my signature haircut.

01:02.210 --> 01:03.610
At 13 I announced

01:03.680 --> 01:05.580
I was going
to Bryn Mawr College.

01:05.650 --> 01:07.780
In Katharine Hepburn's
old room.

01:07.850 --> 01:09.390
From Day 1 I knew

01:09.450 --> 01:11.050
that decision
was a charmed one.

01:11.120 --> 01:13.220
♪ Did you say ♪

01:13.290 --> 01:16.860
♪ I've got a lot to learn? ♪

01:16.930 --> 01:19.330
First of all, my roommate
Petra was friendly and fat,

01:19.400 --> 01:21.370
which was perfect. I'll
have someone to eat with

01:21.430 --> 01:22.600
who won't steal my boyfriend.

01:22.670 --> 01:24.600
It smells so good.

01:24.670 --> 01:27.670
The campus
was old and elegant,

01:27.740 --> 01:31.640
with ivy-covered buildings
and stained glass windows

01:31.710 --> 01:32.810
and...

01:32.880 --> 01:35.040
Monogrammed butter pats.

01:35.110 --> 01:36.710
What? Oh.

01:36.780 --> 01:38.380
This was a magical place

01:38.450 --> 01:39.850
where butter was beautiful

01:39.920 --> 01:41.820
and I would solve
the mysteries of the universe

01:41.890 --> 01:44.490
and meet brilliant women,
kindred spirits

01:44.550 --> 01:47.460
who would explore this
brave new world with me.

01:47.520 --> 01:49.230
Ooh! My God,
it's burning.

01:49.290 --> 01:50.560
It's supposed to.
It's bleach.

01:50.630 --> 01:52.260
It's awful.
I hate you for this.

01:52.330 --> 01:53.860
- It was your idea.
- Never listen to me.

01:53.930 --> 01:55.000
I'm nuts.

01:55.060 --> 01:56.570
Why aren't you in pain?

01:56.630 --> 01:57.830
I'm from Kansas.

01:57.900 --> 01:59.240
I don't know
what that means.

01:59.300 --> 02:00.940
- How much longer?
- Ten minutes.

02:01.000 --> 02:02.140
Oh, Jiminy Crickets.

02:02.210 --> 02:04.910
Where are you going?
Where is she going?

02:04.970 --> 02:06.740
I don't know.

02:06.810 --> 02:09.680
Midge. Midge?

02:09.750 --> 02:10.780
Midge!

02:10.850 --> 02:13.280
- How much longer?
- Nine minutes!

02:13.350 --> 02:16.420
Holy fucking Christ balls!

02:16.490 --> 02:17.790
But all of these
marvelous adventures

02:17.850 --> 02:20.560
were simply the preamble
to my ultimate destiny.

02:20.620 --> 02:23.030
I was going to meet a man...

02:23.090 --> 02:24.860
a perfect man.

02:24.930 --> 02:27.700
He would be 6'4" and blond,

02:27.760 --> 02:30.900
and his name would be
Dashiell or Stafford or...

02:30.970 --> 02:33.540
Joel. Joel Maisel.

02:37.240 --> 02:38.710
Best buildup
since Iceman Cometh.

02:38.780 --> 02:43.710
Joel Maisel was my knight
in shining armor,

02:43.780 --> 02:45.080
a gift from God,

02:45.150 --> 02:46.450
and he thought
I was brilliant.

02:46.520 --> 02:49.850
He took me to galleries
and poetry readings

02:49.920 --> 02:51.560
and Greek dramas.

02:53.000 --> 02:59.074
Advertise your product or brand here

03:03.200 --> 03:05.240
Uh, excuse me.
Excuse me, Miss.

03:05.300 --> 03:06.670
Thanks, toots.

03:06.740 --> 03:09.210
Man:
Honey, don't go away.

03:09.270 --> 03:10.840
She's going
to need that.

03:12.480 --> 03:16.910
That was Misty Dream,
ladies and gentlemen.

03:16.980 --> 03:19.720
You know, she's only 18...

03:19.780 --> 03:21.490
in dog years.

03:21.550 --> 03:25.320
Anyway, I'll leave the jokes
to our next performer.

03:25.390 --> 03:28.330
He's fresh out
of the Merchant Marines

03:28.390 --> 03:32.130
or some patriotic
shit like that.

03:32.200 --> 03:34.800
And, uh,
let's hear it for him...

03:34.860 --> 03:36.170
Lenny Bruce.

03:36.230 --> 03:38.130
This is the guy
I wanted you to see.

03:38.200 --> 03:40.240
No way he's funnier
than Misty.

03:40.300 --> 03:41.740
Thank you.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.570
And so I was
reading the paper,

03:43.640 --> 03:45.280
and, uh, there was a story.

03:45.340 --> 03:48.010
These kids... uh,
8- and 9-year-old...

03:48.080 --> 03:52.050
were sniffing airplane glue
to get high on.

03:52.120 --> 03:54.580
These kids are responsible
for turning musicians on

03:54.650 --> 03:56.650
to a lot of things they
never knew about, actually.

03:56.720 --> 03:59.390
Then I had a fantasy
of how it happened.

03:59.460 --> 04:01.330
The kid is alone in his room.

04:01.390 --> 04:02.690
It's Saturday.

04:02.760 --> 04:05.560
The kid is played
by George Macready.

04:07.860 --> 04:09.470
Well, let's see now.

04:09.530 --> 04:11.300
I'm all alone in a room,
and it's Saturday.

04:11.370 --> 04:13.300
I'll make an airplane.
That's what I'll do.

04:13.370 --> 04:14.900
I'll make a Lancaster.

04:14.970 --> 04:16.310
Good structural design.

04:16.370 --> 04:17.810
I'll get the balsa wood here.

04:17.870 --> 04:20.240
I'll cut it out.
I'll sand it down.

04:20.310 --> 04:21.750
Add a little airplane glue.

04:21.810 --> 04:23.980
I'll rub it
on a rag and, uh...

04:26.220 --> 04:29.020
Hey now.

04:29.090 --> 04:30.790
I'm getting loaded.

04:31.820 --> 04:34.360
Midge: Oh, the things
Joel taught me.

04:34.420 --> 04:36.330
You know what I want?

04:36.390 --> 04:38.160
Please don't say a virgin.

04:38.230 --> 04:40.100
I want
to make you laugh

04:40.160 --> 04:41.500
every day
of your life.

04:41.570 --> 04:43.300
Oh, great,
but not now, though.

04:43.370 --> 04:45.470
- No, no, not now.
- Mm-mm.

04:47.000 --> 04:48.970
I have been very lucky.

04:49.040 --> 04:50.840
I have wonderful parents.

04:50.910 --> 04:52.610
I've had a very
comfortable life,

04:52.680 --> 04:54.310
and though I knew
that love would be great,

04:54.380 --> 04:56.010
I had no idea
it would be anything

04:56.080 --> 04:57.980
that could justify what I
paid for this dress.

04:58.050 --> 05:01.050
What I paid for that
dress. We're very happy.

05:01.120 --> 05:02.790
And because it's better

05:02.850 --> 05:04.390
than anything
I could have imagined,

05:04.450 --> 05:05.890
I thought I should
get up here today

05:05.960 --> 05:09.190
and tell all of you
that I love this man.

05:10.630 --> 05:13.260
And yes, there is shrimp
in the egg rolls.

05:14.830 --> 05:16.500
Miriam.

05:17.730 --> 05:20.100
Excuse me.
We have a problem.

05:20.170 --> 05:21.410
Rabbi, she's kidding.

05:22.610 --> 05:23.910
You show me in the Bible

05:23.970 --> 05:25.610
where God says
you can't eat shrimp.

05:25.680 --> 05:28.010
Leviticus. Whatever does
not have fins or scales,

05:28.080 --> 05:30.050
- you shall not eat.
- But did He say shrimp?

Hmm? How? When?

06:04.650 --> 06:05.920
We heard today.
My mother fainted,

06:05.980 --> 06:07.750
then called four people,
then fainted again.

06:07.820 --> 06:09.050
This year, on Yom Kippur,

06:09.120 --> 06:10.790
Rabbi Krinsky
will be breaking fast

06:10.850 --> 06:12.460
- at our house.
- You're gonna need some lamb.

06:12.520 --> 06:13.890
Rabbi loves his lamb.

06:13.960 --> 06:16.060
Excuse me.
I'm in the middle

06:16.130 --> 06:18.330

What were you getting?
- Pork chops.

06:18.390 --> 06:19.430
Put her pork chops
on my tab.

06:19.500 --> 06:20.900
Oh, I can't believe it.

06:20.960 --> 06:22.400
The rabbi's been mad
at us since the wedding.

06:22.470 --> 06:23.830
It only took four years
of apologies

06:23.900 --> 06:25.600
and a dreidel signed
by Sammy Davis Jr.,

06:25.670 --> 06:27.700
but we finally
got the bastard.

06:27.770 --> 06:30.370
- Disgraceful.
- You like your
free pork chops?

06:30.440 --> 06:32.040
- Zip it, then.
- Delivery Thursday?

06:32.110 --> 06:33.340

Hello.

07:33.740 --> 07:35.470
You tell everyone
about the rabbi?

07:35.540 --> 07:37.970
What am I, a braggart?
Please. How's work?

07:38.040 --> 07:39.710
I believe something
got sold today.

07:39.780 --> 07:40.980
- Hmm.
- How's the brisket?

07:41.040 --> 07:43.050
I'm buying it a sash
and a crown.

07:43.110 --> 07:44.480
Good. We'll need it.

07:44.550 --> 07:46.550
I got a terrible stage time
for tonight: 1:45.

07:46.620 --> 07:48.420
- Yikes.
- I bowed out of
my lunch meeting

07:48.480 --> 07:49.920
and got downtown
as quickly as I could.

07:49.990 --> 07:51.660
But that guy who runs
the Gaslight...

07:51.720 --> 07:52.990
Baz. You must
learn his name.

07:53.060 --> 07:55.660
Fine. Baz still gave me
the crappiest time.

07:55.730 --> 07:57.860
- He hates me.
- Don't worry. We'll fix it.

07:57.930 --> 07:59.700
He doesn't see me
as a real comedian.

07:59.760 --> 08:01.260
I mean, I'm not
a real comedian yet,

08:01.330 --> 08:03.070
but if he'd just
give me a better time...

08:03.130 --> 08:04.870
- We will fix it.
- 1:45.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.440
No one is there at 1:45.

08:06.500 --> 08:07.840
They're not?
Well, then we'll fix it.

08:07.900 --> 08:09.410
I don't know what I'd
do without you.

08:09.470 --> 08:11.910
- Go on at 1:45.
- Bye.

08:11.980 --> 08:13.710
So the waiter says,
"Fine. I'll try it."

08:13.780 --> 08:14.910
He looks at the bowl

08:14.980 --> 08:16.410
and says "Where the hell
is the spoon?"

08:16.480 --> 08:18.620
And the customer
says "Aha."

08:18.680 --> 08:20.280
So he didn't
bring him a spoon.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.190
And that's why he
didn't eat the soup.

08:23.250 --> 08:24.490
No spoon.

08:24.550 --> 08:26.420
Well, you can't eat
a soup with no spoon.

08:26.490 --> 08:28.460
Oh, boy. That's
a good joke there.

08:28.520 --> 08:32.159
Uh-huh. Penny,
can you walk Mitchell
down to Al's office?

08:32.230 --> 08:34.260
- Of course.
- Al can take you
through the specs.

08:34.330 --> 08:37.900
Okay. Boy, I'll be laughing
about that spoon for a week.

08:43.010 --> 08:44.169
Oi.

08:57.590 --> 08:59.090
I saw Funt
heading down the hall.

08:59.160 --> 09:01.660
I sent him over to Al's
office. He's fine.

09:01.730 --> 09:03.130
You heading down
to the Village tonight?

09:03.190 --> 09:04.890
Midge will be here
any minute.

09:04.960 --> 09:06.760
Joel Maisel,
king of comedy.

09:06.830 --> 09:08.030
All right, all right.

09:08.100 --> 09:09.630
You know, Imogene's dying
to see your act.

09:09.700 --> 09:10.870
I told her
I don't know why.

09:10.930 --> 09:12.570
I see you acting
ridiculous all day long.

09:12.640 --> 09:14.240
Very amusing.
Can I use that?

09:14.300 --> 09:15.670
Seriously,
when can we come?

09:15.740 --> 09:17.340
I have a cab
waiting downstairs.

09:17.410 --> 09:19.040
- Hi, Archie.
- Why'd you have him wait?

09:19.110 --> 09:20.810
We could have taken
another cab.

09:20.880 --> 09:22.480
I know, but the driver's having
trouble with his marriage,

09:22.550 --> 09:24.350
and I hated to send him
off like that.

09:24.410 --> 09:25.620
So I'll come next week?

09:25.680 --> 09:28.050
Next week. Why not?

09:28.120 --> 09:30.050
Bye, Archie.

09:30.120 --> 09:31.050
Good night, Penny.

09:31.120 --> 09:32.190
Good night.

What? Gaslight. What?

11:24.430 --> 11:25.900
Yes. We're open.

11:25.970 --> 11:28.140
Don't know.
When everyone's gone.

11:28.200 --> 11:31.240
Dr. Salk should find
a vaccine for morons.

11:31.310 --> 11:31.940
Yes?

11:32.010 --> 11:33.710
I'm looking for Baz.

11:33.780 --> 11:35.310
Shitter,
back on the right.

11:35.380 --> 11:36.850
I'll wait till he's done.

11:38.380 --> 11:39.480
That the brisket?

11:39.550 --> 11:40.720
It's for Baz.

11:40.780 --> 11:41.990
We pay
the coffee guy?

11:42.050 --> 11:43.720
- Yes.
- Where in here
does it say that?

11:43.790 --> 11:45.760
Jesus Christ, Baz.

11:45.820 --> 11:47.420
Hello, Midge. Is that...

11:47.490 --> 11:48.830
I made my brisket.

11:48.890 --> 11:50.630
So I'm guessing
your husband doesn't like

11:50.690 --> 11:51.830
his time slot tonight.

11:51.900 --> 11:53.330
No, he loves his time slot.

11:53.400 --> 11:54.560
He loves any time slot.

11:54.630 --> 11:55.770
There's just a tiny problem.

11:55.830 --> 11:57.000
Our daughter is sick.

11:57.070 --> 11:58.770
Earache,
And 1:45 is just so late.

11:58.840 --> 12:00.240
I didn't know what to do.
I thought...

12:00.300 --> 12:02.040
Didn't your son have
the measles last week?

12:02.110 --> 12:04.170
What? Uh, yes. Yes, he did.

12:04.240 --> 12:06.210
And the week before that,
your mother had rickets?

12:06.280 --> 12:08.440
Yes. So painful.

12:08.510 --> 12:09.680
And last month,

12:09.750 --> 12:10.880
your sister-in-law
broke her toe.

12:10.950 --> 12:12.120
Your brother
threw out his back.

12:12.180 --> 12:13.450
That's a lot of
health issues.

12:13.520 --> 12:15.080
Your family might want
to eat some fruit.

12:15.150 --> 12:16.820
I'll take that
into consideration.

12:16.890 --> 12:18.890
Okay. 10:30.

12:18.960 --> 12:21.220
Next time,
I'd like some latkes.

12:21.290 --> 12:23.430
I make great latkes,
genius latkes.

12:23.490 --> 12:24.760

Mm-hmm. Where's my kiss?

12:34.770 --> 12:37.210
I should be kissing
the brisket.

12:38.310 --> 12:40.240

12:40.310 --> 12:41.740
The next act up

12:41.810 --> 12:44.510
is a nice clean-cut
young man,

12:44.580 --> 12:45.820
somebody
your mother would love.

12:45.880 --> 12:47.150
He's a comedian.

12:47.220 --> 12:50.150
Give a big hand
for Joel Maisel.

12:55.490 --> 12:56.890
Thanks a lot.

12:56.960 --> 13:00.100
So many of you
may have read the book

13:00.160 --> 13:01.700
The Hidden Persuaders.

13:01.760 --> 13:03.830
It's about Madison Avenue's
marketing men

13:03.900 --> 13:06.070
and how they create
the public personas

13:06.140 --> 13:09.940
we all learn to know
and trust and vote for.

13:11.410 --> 13:12.480
Well, what if,

13:12.540 --> 13:14.480
during the Civil War,

13:14.540 --> 13:16.810
there was no Lincoln?

13:16.880 --> 13:18.610
What if they
had to create him?

13:19.920 --> 13:21.820
This is a telephone
conversation

13:21.890 --> 13:23.990
between Abe Lincoln
and his press agent

13:24.050 --> 13:25.590
just before Gettysburg.

13:28.490 --> 13:30.390
Hi, Abe, sweetheart.
How are you, kid?

13:31.530 --> 13:33.500
How's Gettysburg?

13:33.560 --> 13:34.630
Sort of a drag, huh?

13:34.700 --> 13:36.000
Well, Abe, you know

13:36.070 --> 13:37.430
them small
Pennsylvania towns...

13:37.500 --> 13:39.840
you seen one,
you seen them all.

13:39.900 --> 13:41.540
What's the problem?

13:42.870 --> 13:44.440
You're thinking
of shaving it off?

13:44.510 --> 13:45.940
Uh, Abe,

13:46.010 --> 13:47.840
don't you see
that's part of the image?

13:47.910 --> 13:50.580
Right, with the shawl
and the stove pipe hat

13:50.650 --> 13:52.180
and the string tie.

13:53.320 --> 13:54.980
You don't have the shawl?

13:56.520 --> 13:57.650
Where's the shawl, Abe?

13:57.720 --> 13:59.790
You left it in Washington?

13:59.860 --> 14:01.760
What are you wearing, Abe?

14:01.820 --> 14:03.990
A sort of cardigan?

14:04.060 --> 14:05.690
Abe, don't you see
that doesn't go

14:05.760 --> 14:07.330
with the string tie and beard?

14:08.300 --> 14:10.030
Abe, would you
leave the beard on

14:10.100 --> 14:12.670
and get the shawl, huh?

14:12.740 --> 14:14.940
All right, now, Abe,
you got your speech, right?

14:15.000 --> 14:17.770
Abe, you haven't changed
the speech, have you?

14:17.840 --> 14:19.940
$3.30
and one subway token.

14:20.010 --> 14:21.110
I'll take that token.

14:21.180 --> 14:22.880
Tonight was great.
I killed.

14:22.950 --> 14:24.510
I had a good time,
so I killed.

14:24.580 --> 14:27.320
I need an audience.
I feed off an audience.

14:27.380 --> 14:29.420
I finished, people
started to leave.
Did you see that?

14:29.490 --> 14:30.690
I almost left myself.

14:30.750 --> 14:32.090
10:30. Perfect slot.

14:32.160 --> 14:33.690
Give me that slot
again next time.

14:33.760 --> 14:35.660
Hey. here.

14:37.760 --> 14:39.130
Saw your act.

14:43.100 --> 14:44.630
Don't forget the latkes.

14:46.640 --> 14:47.870
Who's that guy?

14:47.940 --> 14:49.010
She works there.

14:49.070 --> 14:51.770
Heh heh.
Only in the Village.

14:51.840 --> 14:53.110
Taxi!

14:53.180 --> 14:54.710
You got three
more laughs tonight

14:54.780 --> 14:55.950
than you did last time,

14:56.010 --> 14:58.480
and a couple of extra,
like, laughlets.

14:58.550 --> 15:00.550
But what you were
shaking your head for?

15:00.620 --> 15:03.720
- Hmm?
- Nothing. You were great.

15:03.790 --> 15:05.520
I was great.

15:06.820 --> 15:08.090
You know,

15:08.160 --> 15:11.430
you don't really say
hello to the audience.

15:11.490 --> 15:13.030
Maybe you should
write a beginning,

15:13.100 --> 15:15.530
something that says
who you are or something.

15:15.600 --> 15:16.570
What do you think?

15:22.940 --> 15:25.470
Good evening. What a nice...

15:25.540 --> 15:27.210
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

15:27.280 --> 15:29.080
Thank you for the nice...
nice...

15:29.150 --> 15:31.250
"Nice" is a bad, bad word.

15:32.850 --> 15:34.380
All that applause for me?

15:34.450 --> 15:37.020
What am I,
putting out after?

15:37.090 --> 15:39.990
One standing ovation,
everyone goes home pregnant.

15:44.130 --> 15:46.000
Maybe you could do
impressions to start.

15:46.060 --> 15:47.860
You do a great one
of my aunt Bertha

15:47.930 --> 15:49.170
ordering dinner.

15:49.230 --> 15:51.700
"A garnish can be
festive but deadly."

15:51.770 --> 15:52.900
Good night, Gracie.

15:52.970 --> 15:54.270
Good night, Gracie.

17:50.590 --> 17:51.590
Hey.

17:52.790 --> 17:53.920
Good morning.

17:55.320 --> 17:56.960
Did the alarm go off?

17:57.030 --> 17:58.190
It sure did.

17:58.260 --> 18:00.160
Wow. I didn't hear it
at all.

18:00.230 --> 18:01.800
You never do.

18:41.570 --> 18:43.610
Oh, yes, Zelda, please.

18:43.670 --> 18:45.640
- Good morning, Papa.

18:51.610 --> 18:52.580
E... Never mind.

18:52.650 --> 18:54.280
- Here you are.
- Did you get coffee?

18:54.350 --> 18:56.080
Yes, and a great welcome
from my son.

18:56.150 --> 18:58.550
- Men.
- Thanks for taking
the kids last night.

18:58.620 --> 18:59.420
Were they okay?

18:59.490 --> 19:00.790
We need to talk
about the baby.

19:00.860 --> 19:02.430
Why? What's
the matter with her?

19:04.560 --> 19:06.530
That forehead
is not improving.

19:06.600 --> 19:08.460
- What? Are you sure?
- It's getting bigger.

19:08.530 --> 19:10.300
The whole face will be
out of proportion.

19:10.370 --> 19:11.900
Look at the nose.
It's elongating now.

19:11.970 --> 19:14.840
The nose is not the problem.
The nose you can fix.

19:14.900 --> 19:16.140
But this gigantic forehead.

19:16.210 --> 19:17.570
Ma, there's always
bangs.

19:17.640 --> 19:19.380
I'm just afraid she's
not a very pretty girl.

19:19.440 --> 19:21.710
- Mama, she's a baby.
- I just want her to be happy.

19:21.780 --> 19:23.750
It's easier to be happy
when you're pretty.

19:24.980 --> 19:26.180
You're right.
Bangs will help.

19:26.250 --> 19:27.380
Mm-hmm.

19:33.860 --> 19:37.030
Zelda, don't clean in here.
It's fine just the way it is.

19:37.090 --> 19:38.860
How did Joel's
little show go?

19:38.930 --> 19:40.160
It went very well.

19:40.230 --> 19:42.030
I still don't understand
this whole thing.

19:42.100 --> 19:43.500
Whom is he performing for?

19:43.570 --> 19:45.600
- Anyone who shows up.
- And they pay you?

19:45.670 --> 19:47.500
They pass around a basket
at the end of your set,

19:47.570 --> 19:49.140
and whatever's in it
you get to take home.

19:49.200 --> 19:50.470
If you need money,
we can give you money.

19:50.540 --> 19:51.770
No, we don't need money.

19:51.840 --> 19:53.780
Joel is funny, and he
likes to do his comedy.

19:53.840 --> 19:55.410
How long are you going
to be doing this,

19:55.480 --> 19:56.780
running around at night,

19:56.850 --> 19:58.750
taking money from strangers
like a schnorrer?

19:58.810 --> 19:59.950
As long as it's fun.

20:00.020 --> 20:02.080
Six to nine more months
left on those arms.

20:02.150 --> 20:03.820
Really? I've been
doing those exercises

20:03.890 --> 20:04.950
with the soup cans.

20:05.020 --> 20:06.260
Forget the cans.
Buy a bolero.

20:06.320 --> 20:07.520
How did you get in here?

20:07.590 --> 20:09.020
Zelda: I came through
the other door.

20:09.090 --> 20:10.330
Just because there is a door

20:10.390 --> 20:11.830
does not mean you use it.

20:11.890 --> 20:13.660
A door does not represent
infinite possibilities.

20:13.730 --> 20:15.000
Is everything
ordered for next week?

20:15.060 --> 20:16.700
Yes, all done. Ethan,
put your coat on.

20:16.770 --> 20:18.500
You have a whole
apartment to clean.

20:18.570 --> 20:20.240
Just leave this room
the way it is.

20:20.300 --> 20:21.670
I thought we'd do
dinner at your place.

20:21.740 --> 20:23.140
Your dining room's
bigger than ours.

20:23.210 --> 20:24.440
Our dining room is fine.

20:24.510 --> 20:26.010
If you don't
entertain, it's fine.

20:26.070 --> 20:27.410
I'll call you later.
Bye, Papa.

20:27.480 --> 20:28.880
Clean the bathroom.
Clean the bathroom.

20:28.940 --> 20:30.650
- Say goodbye, Ethan.
- You love bathrooms.

20:30.710 --> 20:32.150
Ethan. Ethan.

20:32.210 --> 20:33.350
- Clean them again.
- Ethan. E...

20:33.420 --> 20:34.550
Never mind.

20:35.780 --> 20:38.050
♪ For fun it's
the premium one ♪

20:38.120 --> 20:40.560
She's going on and on
about this miracle treatment

20:40.620 --> 20:41.820
she had done in Mexico.

20:41.890 --> 20:43.360
It involved goat's milk
and avocadoes.

20:43.430 --> 20:45.290
Right ankle 8,
left ankle 8.

20:45.360 --> 20:46.730
They smear it
on your face,

20:46.800 --> 20:48.300
wrap a hot towel
around your head,

20:48.360 --> 20:49.700
and stick two straws
up your nose.

20:49.770 --> 20:51.200
Right calf 11,
left calf 11.

20:51.270 --> 20:52.600
So you can breathe
through the straws.

20:52.670 --> 20:54.440
Then they put you on a boat
and row you out to sea...

20:54.500 --> 20:55.900
Right thigh 18.

20:55.970 --> 20:57.140
And they
drop the anchor,

20:57.210 --> 20:58.510
and you sit there
for four hours.

20:58.570 --> 20:59.840
Right thigh 18 1/2.

20:59.910 --> 21:01.340
- Then they row you back in...
- Hips 34.

21:01.410 --> 21:03.280
- And they scrape you down...
- Waist 25.

21:03.350 --> 21:04.680
...slap you in the face
with old banana skins...

21:04.750 --> 21:07.020
- Bust 32.
- ...charge you $75,
and send you home.

21:07.080 --> 21:09.220
She thinks she looks 20.
I think she looks the same.

21:09.280 --> 21:10.490
Mm.

21:10.550 --> 21:12.120
God, you are
so proportional.

21:12.190 --> 21:14.220
How long have you been
measuring yourself like this?

21:14.290 --> 21:15.720
Every day for ten years.

21:15.790 --> 21:17.290
- Even when you were pregnant?
- Mm.

21:17.360 --> 21:19.260
There's not enough
Daiquiris in the world.

21:19.330 --> 21:20.330
...Chicago, one of
the great comedy...

21:21.630 --> 21:22.830
...recording stars
in the country...

21:22.900 --> 21:24.670
Bob Newhart.
So let's hear it...

21:24.730 --> 21:27.240
There you are.
Are you hungry?
I made curry,

21:27.300 --> 21:28.840
and I ordered Chinese
in case it's awful.

21:28.900 --> 21:31.010
I'm sure it's fine.
Did we have children?

21:31.070 --> 21:32.110
They're upstairs.

21:32.170 --> 21:33.710
- Hi, Imogene.
- Hey, Joel.

21:33.780 --> 21:35.110
Did you hear
we're coming downtown

21:35.180 --> 21:36.480
to see you
tomorrow night?

21:36.550 --> 21:38.080
We haven't been
below 14th in months.

21:38.150 --> 21:39.080
We're very excited.

21:39.150 --> 21:40.250
Don't except too much.

21:40.320 --> 21:41.280
Oh, you'd better
be great.

21:41.350 --> 21:42.650
I'm going to wear a beret.

21:42.720 --> 21:43.790
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

21:43.850 --> 21:46.420
- Mwah. Goodbye, Joel.
- Bye.

21:46.490 --> 21:49.060
Ah, the curry's terrible. We'll
have the takeout.

21:49.120 --> 21:51.390
Bob Newhart:
You've seen one,
you've seen them all.

21:53.100 --> 21:54.430
Right. Uh, listen, Abe,

21:54.500 --> 21:56.830
I got...
What's the problem?

21:56.900 --> 22:00.140
Y-You're thinking
of shaving it off?

22:01.740 --> 22:02.970
Uh, Abe,

22:03.040 --> 22:04.870
don't you see that's
part of the image?

22:04.940 --> 22:07.610
Right, with the shawl
and the stove pipe hat

22:07.680 --> 22:08.810
and the string tie.

22:08.880 --> 22:10.880
You don't have the shawl?

22:11.950 --> 22:13.250
Uh, where's
the shawl, Abe?

22:13.320 --> 22:14.250
Joel?

22:14.320 --> 22:16.390
Joel.

22:16.450 --> 22:18.350
You're not gonna believe this.

22:18.420 --> 22:20.320
Bob Newhart
is doing your act.

22:20.390 --> 22:22.120
- What?
- Bob Newhart.

22:22.190 --> 22:24.130
He's on "Ed Sullivan."
He's doing your act.

22:24.190 --> 22:26.130
He must have come
to the club one night

22:26.190 --> 22:27.330
and seen you perform,

22:27.400 --> 22:28.500
and now
he's on television

22:28.560 --> 22:29.770
doing it
just like you do.

22:29.830 --> 22:31.300
Well, different because
he does it faster,

22:31.370 --> 22:32.470
which is better,
actually,

22:32.540 --> 22:33.600
but that's
besides the point.

22:33.670 --> 22:35.040
I'm mad. Aren't you mad?

22:35.100 --> 22:36.370
Midge, relax.

22:36.440 --> 22:37.710
You're not mad.

22:37.770 --> 22:38.740
No.

22:38.810 --> 22:40.140
Or stunned.

22:40.210 --> 22:41.940
Not even mildly bemused?

22:42.010 --> 22:43.380
It's his act.

22:44.410 --> 22:45.680
What?

22:45.750 --> 22:47.550
Are you gonna put the rest
of this on a platter?

22:47.620 --> 22:49.590
How is it his act?
How do you know his act?

22:49.650 --> 22:51.150
I've got his record.

22:51.220 --> 22:53.320
So you stole
Bob Newhart's act.

22:53.390 --> 22:55.120
It's fine.
Everybody does it.

22:55.190 --> 22:56.760
Everybody steals his act?

22:56.830 --> 22:57.430
Yes.

22:57.490 --> 22:59.330
No. Not steals.

22:59.390 --> 23:01.300
Borrows.
It's no big deal.

23:01.360 --> 23:02.800
It's not? When I found out

23:02.870 --> 23:04.370
June Freedman
used my meatloaf recipe,

23:04.430 --> 23:06.230
I almost stabbed her
in the eye with a fork.

23:06.300 --> 23:07.700
Everybody in comedy
steals...

23:07.770 --> 23:08.640
Borrows.

23:08.700 --> 23:10.310
Borrows everybody
else's jokes,

23:10.370 --> 23:11.870
especially
at the beginning.

23:11.940 --> 23:13.940
Bob Newhart probably used
Henny Youngman's stuff

23:14.010 --> 23:15.140
when he started.

23:15.210 --> 23:17.410
- It's how it's done.
- Oh.

23:17.480 --> 23:19.050
Well, if that's
how it's done.

23:19.110 --> 23:20.080
It is.

23:22.250 --> 23:24.090
I thought
you'd written it...

23:24.150 --> 23:25.120
that act.

23:27.760 --> 23:29.590
I feel a little silly now.

23:29.660 --> 23:32.030
Well, I did
put my spin on it.

23:32.090 --> 23:32.900
Yes. You slowed it down.

23:32.960 --> 23:34.500
And my inflection
is different.

23:34.560 --> 23:36.400
Right.
I'm new to this, so...

23:36.470 --> 23:38.000
You'll learn.

23:38.070 --> 23:39.370
I guess I will.

23:39.430 --> 23:40.670
You want a drink?

23:40.740 --> 23:41.700
Sure.

23:44.810 --> 23:47.740
Guess I'd better go apologize
to June Freedman now.

24:02.690 --> 24:04.090
- Hello.
- How's the brisket?

24:04.160 --> 24:05.760
-Is it okay?
-Do you know something I don't?

24:05.830 --> 24:07.230
Just answer
the question, Midge.

24:07.300 --> 24:08.560
Yes. It's fine.
What's the matter?

24:08.630 --> 24:10.030
I had to work
straight through lunch,

24:10.100 --> 24:12.640
so I couldn't go downtown
to get a time for tonight.

24:12.700 --> 24:14.640
Tonight, you understand?
- Tonight. Yes, I understand.

24:14.700 --> 24:16.100
Archie and Imogene
are coming, remember?

24:16.170 --> 24:17.270
Of course I remember.

24:17.340 --> 24:18.410
They're coming tonight,

24:18.470 --> 24:19.840
and I don't have a time.

24:19.910 --> 24:21.840
You know what?
Cancel them.
Tell them I'm sick.

24:21.910 --> 24:23.410
They've got a babysitter.
It's all arranged.

24:23.480 --> 24:24.950
I should have changed
that lunch, damn it.

24:25.010 --> 24:26.550
Joel, come on.
I promise you'll get on.

24:26.620 --> 24:28.280
I'll bring the brisket.
I'll do my thing.

24:28.350 --> 24:29.520
Everything will be fine, okay?

24:29.590 --> 24:31.790
- Okay.
- Hey.

24:31.850 --> 24:33.260
Remember
this whole comedy thing,

24:33.320 --> 24:34.390
it's supposed to be fun.

24:34.460 --> 24:35.860
That's why we do it, right?

24:35.920 --> 24:37.630
Right. Well,
you'll have to bring me

24:37.690 --> 24:39.090
my show sweater.
I left it at home.

24:39.160 --> 24:41.160
- I can do that.
- And you have to be
here right at 8.

24:41.230 --> 24:42.670
I will be on time.

24:42.730 --> 24:44.130
Okay. I should go.

24:47.400 --> 24:48.670
Huh.

24:48.740 --> 24:51.170
Your daddy is crazy.

24:52.410 --> 24:54.210
Now let's measure
that forehead.

24:57.410 --> 24:58.880
Pull over here.
I'll just be a minute.

25:00.020 --> 25:00.780
Oh, geez.

25:00.850 --> 25:02.020
Where the hell have you been?

25:02.080 --> 25:03.320
- It's 8:30.
- I know. I'm sorry.

25:03.390 --> 25:04.720
Go. Go, go.

25:10.130 --> 25:11.660
- Do you have my sweater?
- Yes.

25:11.730 --> 25:13.230
You didn't have
to stand out there.

25:13.300 --> 25:14.500
I would have come up.

25:14.560 --> 25:16.100
You get here at 8,
you come up.

25:16.160 --> 25:17.300
Are you kidding me?

25:17.370 --> 25:18.770
- What?
- Holes.

25:18.830 --> 25:20.040
- Holes everywhere.
- What?

25:20.100 --> 25:21.200
I can't believe
you didn't look at it

25:21.270 --> 25:22.640
before you left
the house.

25:22.710 --> 25:24.270
I was in a hurry to meet you.
You can hardly see them.

25:24.340 --> 25:25.610
Hardly see? Look, look.

25:25.670 --> 25:28.610
A hole here, a hole here,
two holes here.

25:28.680 --> 25:29.780
I mean,
how does this happen?

25:29.850 --> 25:31.410
It was probably a moth.

25:31.480 --> 25:33.120
- A moth?
- Yes.

25:33.180 --> 25:34.350
What moth?

25:34.420 --> 25:35.750
Ted. Ted the Moth.

25:35.820 --> 25:37.420
Dime-sized holes,
that's his signature.

25:37.490 --> 25:39.220
- You think this is funny?
- I think it doesn't matter.

25:39.290 --> 25:41.360
Going on stage with holes
in my shirt like a bum.

25:41.420 --> 25:44.630
It's downtown. If you
have underwear on,
you're overdressed.

25:46.830 --> 25:48.760
Hey, why don't you
talk about it?

25:48.830 --> 25:50.070
- About what?
- About your sweater.

25:50.130 --> 25:51.570
You know, joke about it
in your act.

25:51.630 --> 25:53.540
It'll be fun,
personal, yours.

25:53.600 --> 25:54.700
I don't know.

25:54.770 --> 25:56.070
Oh, great. They're here.

25:56.140 --> 25:57.610
Okay, why don't you
go join them,

25:57.670 --> 25:59.310
have a cup of coffee,
calm down?

25:59.370 --> 26:00.580
I'll go deal
with this, okay?

26:00.640 --> 26:02.280
Yeah, fine. Hurry.

26:02.340 --> 26:03.650
Mm-hmm.

26:07.550 --> 26:09.020
Excuse me.
Is Baz around?

26:09.080 --> 26:10.350
Nope.

26:14.390 --> 26:15.720
Excuse me.

26:15.790 --> 26:19.800
Um, do you see my husband
Joel Maisel over there?

26:20.860 --> 26:22.300
Okay. He couldn't
get away from work

26:22.360 --> 26:25.270
to come down here earlier
for a time to perform.

26:25.330 --> 26:27.100
He's a comedian.

26:27.170 --> 26:28.870
Anyhow, it was
a crazy day at work,

26:28.940 --> 26:30.770
and, see, tonight
our best friends are here...

26:30.840 --> 26:32.310
- the Clearys, and...
- Wait a minute.

26:32.370 --> 26:34.210
The Clearys are here?

26:34.280 --> 26:35.480
You're kidding me.
Where?

26:35.540 --> 26:36.710
Over there.

26:37.980 --> 26:40.020
Well, I will be damned.

26:40.080 --> 26:43.420
Well, that is exciting.
The Clearys are here.

26:43.490 --> 26:44.790
Wow.

26:47.520 --> 26:48.960
Anyhow,

26:49.020 --> 26:50.990
I was wondering
if you could find a way

26:51.060 --> 26:52.760
to give my husband
a better time...

26:52.830 --> 26:54.560
preferably before 11:30.

26:54.630 --> 26:55.760
Why isn't he over here?

26:55.830 --> 26:57.100
- What?
- Mr. Saturday Night.

26:57.170 --> 26:58.670
Why isn't he
asking for the time?

26:58.730 --> 27:00.470
Why are you asking
for the time?

27:00.540 --> 27:02.070
Well, I have the brisket.

27:05.140 --> 27:06.170
So...

27:06.240 --> 27:08.310
anything you can do
would be great.

27:08.380 --> 27:10.380
So thanks.

27:12.680 --> 27:14.850
That looks
like Allen Ginsberg.

27:14.920 --> 27:16.820
Imogene, doesn't that look
like Allen Ginsberg?

27:16.890 --> 27:18.620
Everyone here looks
like Allen Ginsberg.

27:18.690 --> 27:19.960
- Hey, there, kitten.
- Hi.

27:20.020 --> 27:21.520
This place
is perfectly filthy.

27:21.590 --> 27:22.660
You should see
the bathroom.

27:22.730 --> 27:24.030
Don't go in the bathroom.

27:24.090 --> 27:25.830
Well, now I'm definitely
going in the bathroom.

27:27.160 --> 27:29.030
- Oh.
- Archie: No, no. I got this.

27:29.100 --> 27:30.400
A starving artist
never pays.

27:30.470 --> 27:31.870
I'm not
a starving artist.

27:31.930 --> 27:33.300
Your sweater
tells another story.

27:33.370 --> 27:34.570
Here you go.

27:34.640 --> 27:36.670
So? What did he say?

27:36.740 --> 27:37.940
Uh, he wasn't there,

27:38.010 --> 27:39.670
but the lady said
she'd work it out.

27:45.810 --> 27:48.020
Man: Now who here
likes hillbilly polka?

27:49.450 --> 27:51.120
All right, next up, a lady

27:51.190 --> 27:53.390
fresh off some boat
from somewhere.

27:53.460 --> 27:54.790
When the hell
am I going on?

27:54.860 --> 27:56.120
I don't know. Soon.

27:56.190 --> 27:57.690
Janet Shaw.

28:01.700 --> 28:03.030
Woman: All right.

28:03.100 --> 28:05.600
This poem is about...

28:05.670 --> 28:07.240
Spokane.

28:10.870 --> 28:12.470
Spokane...

28:13.780 --> 28:15.210
Spokane.

28:16.780 --> 28:18.180
Spokane.

28:20.180 --> 28:21.720
Man.

28:23.720 --> 28:24.950
I'll be right back.

28:25.020 --> 28:28.420
Rumble of lumber trucks.

28:28.490 --> 28:29.460
Spokane.

28:29.520 --> 28:31.060
- Where is she?
- Who?

28:31.130 --> 28:32.560
The one who looks like
she lives under a bridge.

28:32.630 --> 28:34.530
Oh. Susie. She went out.

28:34.600 --> 28:35.730
Do you know where?

28:35.800 --> 28:37.170
God, no. Who would ask?

28:37.230 --> 28:39.840
Poet:
Robbers of the indigenous.

28:39.900 --> 28:41.340
- Any minute now.
- Spokane.

28:41.400 --> 28:43.010
Kitten, we're
going to have to
take a rain check.

28:43.070 --> 28:44.310
Oh, it was a blast, though.

28:44.370 --> 28:46.040
Oh, no, wait... wait
just a few minutes.

28:46.110 --> 28:47.580
We got to head
home, too.

28:47.640 --> 28:49.510
- We can't leave.
- I have an early
morning meeting.

28:49.580 --> 28:51.880
I say
we just tell everybody
it was Allen Ginsberg.

28:51.950 --> 28:54.320
You're up.

28:54.380 --> 28:55.680
What? What did he say?

28:55.750 --> 28:56.990
I think she said you're up.

28:57.050 --> 28:58.190
Imogene: Oh, goodie.

29:00.220 --> 29:01.220
Man.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.960
Emcee:
Thank you, Janet Shaw.

29:07.030 --> 29:08.830
Don't need to go
to Spokane now.

29:08.900 --> 29:11.800
All right, up next,
we have a comedian.

29:11.870 --> 29:14.040
That's you. Go. Be funny.

29:14.100 --> 29:16.340
Joel Maisel.

29:18.270 --> 29:19.410
Whoo!

29:20.840 --> 29:22.080
Thank you. Thanks a lot.

29:22.140 --> 29:23.910
So exciting.

29:25.650 --> 29:26.880
So...

29:26.950 --> 29:28.180
my sweater...

29:29.520 --> 29:31.250
It's a new sweater,

29:31.320 --> 29:33.160
but I asked my wife
to bring it to me

29:33.220 --> 29:34.760
because I work during the day,

29:34.820 --> 29:37.130
so she does, and I put it on.

29:37.190 --> 29:39.030
Holes.

29:39.090 --> 29:41.260
Holes in my sweater.

29:49.040 --> 29:50.510
So I asked,
"How did this happen?"

29:50.570 --> 29:51.810
And she says "Moths."

29:51.870 --> 29:53.710
And I'm like,
"Moths? What moths?"

29:53.780 --> 29:55.380
And she says "Ted."

29:57.880 --> 29:59.350
"Ted the Moth."

30:01.920 --> 30:04.090
He's very avant garde.

30:04.150 --> 30:06.020
Th-That was just...
That was just something

30:06.090 --> 30:08.590
that, uh...happened.

30:10.660 --> 30:13.100
Okay. So, uh, uh...

30:13.160 --> 30:14.400
anyhow, this is, uh,

30:14.460 --> 30:17.430
a press agent talking
to Abe Lincoln.

30:17.500 --> 30:19.830
Hi, Abe, sweetheart.
How's Gettys...

30:19.900 --> 30:22.000
Sorry. Did... Did any
of you read the book

30:22.070 --> 30:23.170
The Hidden Persuaders?

30:23.240 --> 30:24.440
It's about marketing agents,

30:24.510 --> 30:25.670
and they had to
create Abe Lincoln.

30:26.980 --> 30:28.980
I mean, if they had
to create Abe Lincoln.

30:29.040 --> 30:30.450
The book's not about that.

30:30.510 --> 30:33.550
Uh...this... this bit...

30:33.620 --> 30:34.850
Anyhow...

30:36.990 --> 30:39.090
Hi, Abe, sweetheart.
How's Gettysburg?

30:39.150 --> 30:40.590
Kind of a drag, huh?

30:40.660 --> 30:43.090
Well, Abe, you know them
small Pennsylvania towns...

30:43.160 --> 30:44.660
you seen one,
you seem them all.

30:44.730 --> 30:46.360
What's the problem?

30:46.430 --> 30:48.360
You're thinking
of shaving it off?

30:49.860 --> 30:51.870
Uh, Abe, don't you see?

30:51.930 --> 30:54.270
That's, uh... That doesn't go
with the string tie and b...

30:54.340 --> 30:56.140
Don't you see that's
part of the image?

30:56.200 --> 30:59.310
Right, with the shawl
and the stove pipe hat
and the string tie.

31:08.520 --> 31:11.450
You told me to talk
about my sweater.

31:11.520 --> 31:12.550
I know.

31:14.290 --> 31:15.520
I just thought
you'd put it

31:15.590 --> 31:17.960
into some sort of
joke form or something.

31:19.360 --> 31:20.460
Sorry.

31:28.640 --> 31:29.900
Don't.

31:48.990 --> 31:50.630
Can I get you anything?

32:20.060 --> 32:21.390
What are you doing?

32:22.760 --> 32:25.090
I have to go.

32:25.160 --> 32:26.630
I have to leave.

32:28.100 --> 32:31.000
You.
I have to leave you.

32:32.230 --> 32:33.940
That's my suitcase.

32:34.000 --> 32:35.340
It is?

32:35.400 --> 32:38.070
You going to leave me
with my suitcase?

32:39.040 --> 32:40.780
Joel,
tomorrow's Yom Kippur.

32:40.840 --> 32:42.240
I'm... I'm...
I'm not happy.

32:42.310 --> 32:44.350
Nobody's happy.
It's Yom Kippur.

32:44.410 --> 32:45.810
I don't know
how to do this.

32:45.880 --> 32:47.080
I'm not good
at things like this.

32:47.150 --> 32:48.450
Things like what?
Like leaving me?

32:48.520 --> 32:50.620
- Yes.
- So don't. Practice a little.

32:50.690 --> 32:52.350
Try it again when you feel
more confident about the moves.

32:52.420 --> 32:53.990
- Midge...
- Joel, the rabbi is coming.

32:54.060 --> 32:55.360
Yeah. I know he is.

32:55.420 --> 32:57.060
Five years we've been
trying to get the rabbi,

32:57.130 --> 32:58.660
and this year we got him.
We got the rabbi.

32:58.730 --> 32:59.860
I should go.

32:59.930 --> 33:01.330
No. P-Please.
I don't understand.

33:01.400 --> 33:03.600
I thought my life was going
to be something different.

33:03.670 --> 33:06.170
I thought I was going
to be someone different,

33:06.230 --> 33:07.700
but tonight was
just so terrible.

33:07.770 --> 33:09.870
I mean, a whole room
full of people
just watching me bomb.

33:09.940 --> 33:10.970
It was one stupid night.

33:11.040 --> 33:12.110
And I'm up there dying,

33:12.170 --> 33:13.340
and I'm thinking
about last week.

33:13.410 --> 33:14.840
We're in temple,
and the rabbi tells

33:14.910 --> 33:16.310
that stupid Sodom
and Gomorrah joke,

33:16.380 --> 33:17.810
and suddenly the whole
synagogue goes nuts.

33:17.880 --> 33:19.980
- So?
- He got more laughs
in five minutes

33:20.050 --> 33:21.350
than I did in five months.

33:21.420 --> 33:22.880
You're jealous of the rabbi?

33:22.950 --> 33:24.620
He was in Buchenwald.
Throw him a bone.

33:24.690 --> 33:26.620
Did you ever think you were
supposed to be something,

33:26.690 --> 33:29.620
and, uh, and you suddenly
realize you're not?

33:29.690 --> 33:31.190
Yes. Married.

33:31.260 --> 33:32.860
- That's good. You're good.
- Joel, please.

33:32.930 --> 33:35.700
I'm never going
to be a professional
comedian, Midge. Never.

33:35.760 --> 33:37.130
No, of course not.

33:38.070 --> 33:39.430
What do you mean,
of course not?

33:39.500 --> 33:40.900
What do you mean,
what do I mean?

33:40.970 --> 33:43.000
What did you think
all those nights
at the club were?

33:43.070 --> 33:44.410
I thought they were fun.

33:44.470 --> 33:45.940
I thought they were
our fun couples thing,

33:46.010 --> 33:47.240
like how the Morgensterns
play golf

33:47.310 --> 33:48.880
or how the Meyers
ballroom dance

33:48.940 --> 33:50.580
or how the Levins
pretend they're from
Warsaw once a week

33:50.650 --> 33:52.380
to get 10% off
of that Polish restaurant

33:52.450 --> 33:54.380
- that does Kielbasa Night.
- I can't believe this.

33:54.450 --> 33:55.850
I never knew you were
serious about it.

33:55.920 --> 33:57.450
Of course I was serious,
Miriam.

33:57.520 --> 33:59.420
What the hell ever made you
think I wasn't serious?

33:59.490 --> 34:01.660
Well, for starters, you were
doing someone else's act.

34:01.720 --> 34:04.360
I told you, everybody
does that when they start.

34:04.430 --> 34:05.690
If you wanted
to be a comedian,

34:05.760 --> 34:07.400
you should have
at least written a joke.

34:07.460 --> 34:09.030
I tried
with the Ted thing.

34:09.100 --> 34:10.570
- I wrote the Ted thing.
- And it bombed.

34:10.630 --> 34:12.429
- Because you killed it.
- Oh, forget it.

34:12.500 --> 34:14.239
Joel, come on.
You have a job.

34:14.300 --> 34:16.199
Yet the comedy
was a dream.

34:16.270 --> 34:18.210
Do you know
what a dream is?

34:18.270 --> 34:20.010
A dream is what
keeps you going

34:20.070 --> 34:21.239
in a job you hate.

34:21.310 --> 34:22.540
Since when do you
hate your job?

34:22.610 --> 34:24.280
Do you know what I do,
Midge?

34:24.350 --> 34:25.710
You're
the vice president of...

34:25.780 --> 34:26.710
No, no, no, no.

34:26.780 --> 34:28.679
Do you know what I do
every day?

34:28.750 --> 34:29.780
Day in and day out,

34:29.850 --> 34:31.520
what the actual
physical machinations

34:31.590 --> 34:32.320
of my job are?

34:32.389 --> 34:33.560
- No.
- Neither do I!

34:33.620 --> 34:36.320
I take meetings.
I take phone calls.

34:36.389 --> 34:37.659
I shuffle paper around,

34:37.730 --> 34:38.489
and I have no idea

34:38.560 --> 34:39.960
of what the hell
I actually do.

34:40.030 --> 34:41.600
Maybe if you did,
you'd like it more.

34:42.730 --> 34:43.600
I just thought,

34:43.670 --> 34:45.730
with the brisket
and the notebook,

34:45.800 --> 34:47.540
I thought you understood.

34:48.969 --> 34:50.739
I'm sorry.

34:51.810 --> 34:54.110
Yeah. Me, too.

34:54.179 --> 34:56.810
But, Joel,
you can't just leave.

34:56.880 --> 34:58.250
I love you.

34:58.310 --> 35:00.550
We have a home.
We have children.

35:00.620 --> 35:02.120
- They're going to notice.
- I have to go.

35:02.180 --> 35:03.650
No, no, no. Wait.
I will be better.

35:03.720 --> 35:06.350
I will do better. I... I'll...
I'll pay more attention.

35:06.420 --> 35:07.590
You can quit your job.

35:07.660 --> 35:09.060
We can go to the club
every single night,

35:09.120 --> 35:10.160
and I'll buy more notebooks.

35:10.230 --> 35:11.530
I've been having an affair.

35:14.000 --> 35:15.230
It's been
going on for months.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.760
I thought it was
a phase, but now...

35:16.830 --> 35:17.770
Who?

35:19.430 --> 35:20.400
Penny.

35:22.800 --> 35:23.740
Your secretary.

35:25.470 --> 35:26.740
You're leaving me for a girl

35:26.810 --> 35:28.340
who can't figure out
how to sharpen pencils?

35:28.410 --> 35:30.110
It's not about her,
and it was a new sharpener.

35:30.180 --> 35:32.210
It was electric.
All she had to do was push.

35:32.280 --> 35:34.120
Don't you understand?
I need to start over.

35:34.180 --> 35:35.850
With her? She wins?

35:35.920 --> 35:37.120
It's not a contest.

35:37.190 --> 35:38.420
I just don't want
this life,

35:38.490 --> 35:40.420
this whole
upper West Side,

35:40.490 --> 35:42.860
classic six,
best seats in temple.

35:42.920 --> 35:44.630
Wife, two kids.

35:44.690 --> 35:46.730
I just don't...

35:48.030 --> 35:49.460
want it.

35:54.540 --> 35:56.740
So you'll tell
your parents for me?

36:02.010 --> 36:04.750
Oh, that might be
the funniest thing
you've ever said.

36:04.810 --> 36:06.210
- Honey...
- Tomorrow is Yom Kippur.

36:06.280 --> 36:07.550
I have 30 people
and a rabbi

36:07.620 --> 36:08.950
coming over
for break fast,

36:09.020 --> 36:10.420
and this is the moment
you decide

36:10.490 --> 36:12.520
to tell me you're going
to ride off into the sunset

36:12.590 --> 36:14.590
with your half-wit secretary.

36:14.660 --> 36:15.690
Can I just say

36:15.760 --> 36:20.500
that you have
the worst timing ever?

36:20.560 --> 36:22.000
I'm sorry.

36:22.060 --> 36:24.630
Go on. Get out.

36:24.700 --> 36:26.200
Grab some pens
on your way out.

36:26.270 --> 36:27.570
You're going to need them.

36:43.450 --> 36:45.850
♪♪

36:52.490 --> 36:54.300
Jerry: Good evening,
Mr. Maisel.

36:54.360 --> 36:55.860
Going on a trip?

37:20.050 --> 37:21.990
Papa.

37:22.060 --> 37:23.860
Rose.

37:23.930 --> 37:25.560
Papa.

37:25.630 --> 37:26.890
Rose.

37:26.960 --> 37:28.200
Papa, wait.
I... I just...

37:28.260 --> 37:30.000
- Rose!
- I'm here. My God.

37:30.060 --> 37:32.470
What are you wearing?
It's not thinning.

37:32.530 --> 37:33.940
I have something to tell you.

37:34.000 --> 37:36.340
You should both sit.

37:40.680 --> 37:41.710
Joel left.

37:42.610 --> 37:44.180
He packed up my suitcase,

37:44.250 --> 37:45.810
and he left.

37:45.880 --> 37:47.210
He's gone.

37:47.280 --> 37:48.920
Joel left you?

37:48.980 --> 37:50.590
Yes.

37:50.650 --> 37:53.090
Why? What did you do?

37:53.150 --> 37:55.390
Nothing. I didn't do anything.

37:55.460 --> 37:57.830
He's... He's in love
with his secretary.

37:57.890 --> 37:59.830
Did you know this?
Did you know he was
having an affair?

37:59.890 --> 38:01.530
Of course I didn't know.

38:01.600 --> 38:02.660
- God.
- The girl, is she...

38:02.730 --> 38:04.100
Oh, my God.
Is she pregnant?

38:04.170 --> 38:05.330
Shit.

38:05.400 --> 38:06.530
Did you talk like that
around him?

38:06.600 --> 38:07.640
Did you
use sailor talk?

38:07.700 --> 38:08.870
No, I didn't use
sailor talk.

38:08.940 --> 38:10.410
A man doesn't leave

38:10.470 --> 38:11.610
unless the girlfriend
is pregnant.

38:11.670 --> 38:12.970
What the hell
is he doing in there?

38:13.040 --> 38:14.210
- He's mad.
- At me?

38:14.280 --> 38:15.340
- Shh. They'll hear.
- Who'll hear?

38:15.410 --> 38:17.280
- Them. Them.
- Who is them?

38:17.350 --> 38:18.650
Oh, God, Mama.

38:18.710 --> 38:20.420
- ♪♪
- Papa.

38:21.750 --> 38:22.880
Papa.

38:22.950 --> 38:25.190
Why are you mad?
I didn't do anything wrong.

38:25.250 --> 38:26.690
When I agreed to send you

38:26.750 --> 38:28.420
to that fancy
goyische college,

38:28.490 --> 38:30.430
what was the one
thing I told you?

38:30.490 --> 38:31.660
They'll
have terrible deli?

38:31.730 --> 38:33.090
The important thing
I told you.

38:33.160 --> 38:34.260
That was about deli, too.

38:34.330 --> 38:36.530
The other important
thing I told you!

38:36.600 --> 38:38.530
Don't pick a weak man.

38:38.600 --> 38:39.830
Ah.

38:40.900 --> 38:42.170
This isn't my fault!

38:42.240 --> 38:43.510
Of course
it's your fault.

38:43.570 --> 38:45.310
Rose: Oh, shit!

38:45.370 --> 38:46.840
Mama,
please stop crying.

38:46.910 --> 38:49.380
Everything we
bring on ourselves
is our own fault.

38:49.440 --> 38:51.680
He was a good husband.
He was a good provider.

38:51.750 --> 38:52.980
What are you
going to do now?

38:53.050 --> 38:54.680
What are your children
going to do?

38:54.750 --> 38:56.250
Mama, for the love of God,

38:56.320 --> 38:58.090
please stop crying
in that bedroom!

38:58.150 --> 38:59.620
This isn't fair.

38:59.690 --> 39:01.520
Oh, no!

39:01.590 --> 39:03.190
Much better. Thanks.

39:03.260 --> 39:06.830
Life isn't fair.
It's hard and cruel.

39:06.890 --> 39:10.430
You have to pick your friends
as if there's a war going on.

39:10.500 --> 39:13.170
You want a husband
who'll take a bullet for you,

39:13.230 --> 39:14.540
not one who points
to the attic

39:14.600 --> 39:15.740
and says
"They're up there."

39:15.800 --> 39:17.070
How can you say that
about Joel?

39:17.140 --> 39:18.840
- You liked him.
- I knew what he was.

39:18.910 --> 39:20.310
Why didn't you
tell me, then?

39:20.370 --> 39:22.140
- I did tell you!
- When did you tell me?

39:22.210 --> 39:23.510
When you first
came home with him.

39:23.580 --> 39:25.250
That night.
I looked at you.

39:25.310 --> 39:27.920
I asked, "Is this the choice?"

39:27.980 --> 39:29.250
And you said yes.

39:29.320 --> 39:30.620
That was telling me?

39:30.690 --> 39:32.090
I have to spell it out
for you?

39:32.150 --> 39:33.420
Joel's sick.
Everything's fine.

39:33.490 --> 39:35.120
Not a word of this
to the rabbi.

39:35.190 --> 39:36.660
I'm going to take a bath.

39:38.230 --> 39:39.590
You listen to me, Miriam.

39:39.660 --> 39:42.560
You are a child.
You cannot survive this.

39:42.630 --> 39:45.370
Now, I am no fan of Joel's,
but you need a husband.

39:45.430 --> 39:46.970
And those children
need a father.

39:47.030 --> 39:49.000
What am I supposed to do,
go buy one at Zaybar's?

39:49.070 --> 39:51.540
You fix your face.
Put on his favorite dress.

39:51.610 --> 39:55.140
Then you go out, find him,
and make him come back home.

40:39.450 --> 40:40.960
Mrs. Maisel,
you all right?

40:41.020 --> 40:42.660
- Do you need a cab?
- Nope.

40:42.720 --> 40:44.130
Gonna take the subway.

40:44.190 --> 40:45.630
It's miserable out here.

40:45.690 --> 40:47.730
It's miserable
in there, too.

41:05.580 --> 41:10.990
Man: See,
the eternal war is here.

41:11.050 --> 41:15.820
O victory,
forget your underwear.

41:15.890 --> 41:18.290
We're free.

41:18.360 --> 41:19.730
I'm...

41:19.790 --> 41:21.960
I left my Pyrex here.
I'd like it back.

41:22.030 --> 41:24.830
- Your what?
- Pyrex. My Pyrex.

41:24.900 --> 41:26.800
- Nope.
- It's a Pyrex.

41:26.870 --> 41:28.500
- Yeah, you keep saying that.
- Pyrex.

41:28.570 --> 41:30.670
It's a glass baking dish,
very durable.

41:30.740 --> 41:32.410
It can go from hot to cold
without cracking.

41:32.470 --> 41:33.440
We don't serve food here.

41:33.510 --> 41:34.610
I know. It's not yours.

41:34.680 --> 41:36.010
It's mine. I brought it here.

41:36.080 --> 41:37.880
- Why?
- I made a brisket f...

41:37.950 --> 41:39.380
Is that really
important right now?

41:39.450 --> 41:40.780
My dish is here.
I'd like it back.

41:40.850 --> 41:42.050
Can you make that happen?

41:42.120 --> 41:43.790
This place
gets so weird late.

41:43.850 --> 41:45.590
Emcee: That was deep,

41:45.650 --> 41:47.620
Christian, I think.
Who knows?

41:47.690 --> 41:50.690
Okay, next up. Uh...

41:52.090 --> 41:54.960
folks, just sit tight.
I'll be right back.

41:55.030 --> 41:58.300
Bonnie, where's my set list?

42:11.610 --> 42:13.680
So this is it, huh?

42:13.750 --> 42:16.780
This is the dream...
standing up here

42:16.850 --> 42:20.620
on this filthy,
sticky stage all alone.

42:20.690 --> 42:22.360
Couldn't have that,
you didn't want me.

42:22.420 --> 42:23.990
Was that it, Joel?

42:24.060 --> 42:25.660
Woman: Who's Joel?

42:27.090 --> 42:28.030
What?

42:28.100 --> 42:30.100
Who's Joel?

42:30.160 --> 42:31.170
My husband.

42:31.230 --> 42:32.370
Man: we can't hear you.

42:32.430 --> 42:33.570
Woman: Oh. Shh, shh, shh.

42:33.640 --> 42:34.740
Sorry.

42:34.800 --> 42:37.610
Joel is my husband
of four years,

42:37.670 --> 42:39.040
and tonight he left.

42:39.110 --> 42:39.870
Man: Whoo!

42:39.940 --> 42:41.380
Thank you.
Thank you very much.

42:41.440 --> 42:43.880
Yep. He left... Joel.

42:43.950 --> 42:47.380
Left. He packed up
my suitcase and left.

42:47.450 --> 42:49.450
Oh, I'm going to have
to lie to the rabbi

42:49.520 --> 42:50.950
about
why Joel's not there.

42:51.020 --> 42:52.790
Lying to the rabbi
on Yom Kippur.

42:52.850 --> 42:54.660
I couldn't
get a clean slate
for one fucking day.

42:54.720 --> 42:56.520
I don't understand
what's going on.

42:56.590 --> 42:58.860
Me, either, sister,
me, either.

42:58.930 --> 43:03.100
There are so many questions
spinning around in my head.

43:03.160 --> 43:04.700
Why did he leave?

43:04.770 --> 43:07.100
Why wasn't I enough?

43:07.170 --> 43:10.100
And why didn't they
put the stage over there

43:10.170 --> 43:12.240
against that wall
instead of over here
by the bathroom

43:12.310 --> 43:14.840
so you wouldn't have to listen
to every giant bowel movement

43:14.910 --> 43:16.440
that takes place in there?

43:17.540 --> 43:19.480
Oh, yeah. Clear as a bell.

43:19.550 --> 43:21.050
I'm sorry. I'm a little drunk.

43:21.120 --> 43:22.880
It's all gone.

43:22.950 --> 43:24.950
Everything
I've counted on is gone.

43:25.020 --> 43:27.250
You feeling better now?

43:31.190 --> 43:33.630
So my life completely
fell apart today.

43:33.700 --> 43:35.700
Did I mention
that my husband left me?

43:35.760 --> 43:37.060
Man: Whoo-hoo!

43:37.130 --> 43:39.170
All right. All right.
But did I mention

43:39.230 --> 43:41.670
that he left me
for his secretary?

43:41.740 --> 43:43.200
Mm-hmm.

43:43.270 --> 43:45.610
She's 21 and dumb
as a Brillo pad.

43:45.670 --> 43:49.310
And I'm not naive. I know
that men like stupid girls.

43:49.380 --> 43:50.540
- Right?
- Uh...

43:50.610 --> 43:51.810
But I thought Joel
wanted more than stupid.

43:51.880 --> 43:53.350
I thought he wanted
spontaneity

43:53.410 --> 43:54.650
and wit.

43:54.720 --> 43:56.050
I thought he wanted
to be challenged.

43:56.120 --> 43:57.280
- You know what I mean?
- Uh...

43:57.350 --> 43:59.150
You two are going to be
together forever.

43:59.220 --> 44:01.290
I'll tell you this much.

44:01.360 --> 44:02.660
I was a great wife.

44:02.720 --> 44:04.990
I was fun.
I planned theme nights.

44:05.060 --> 44:08.160
I dressed in costumes.
I gave him kids...

44:08.230 --> 44:09.700
a boy and a girl.

44:09.760 --> 44:11.170
And yes, our little girl
is looking

44:11.230 --> 44:12.830
more and more
like Winston Churchill

44:12.900 --> 44:14.940
every day, you know,
with that big Yalta head.

44:15.000 --> 44:16.840
But that's not a reason
to leave, right?

44:16.900 --> 44:20.410
Really? Really?
After what I just said
about the bathroom?

44:20.470 --> 44:22.710
Walk of shame.

44:22.780 --> 44:26.450
Walk of shame!

44:26.510 --> 44:28.050
I loved him.

44:29.180 --> 44:32.450
And I showed him
I loved him.

44:32.520 --> 44:33.490
Whoo!

44:33.550 --> 44:34.920
All that shit they say

44:34.990 --> 44:36.960
about Jewish girls
in the bedroom?

44:37.020 --> 44:39.730
Not true.
There are French whores

44:39.790 --> 44:41.260
standing around
the Marais District

44:41.330 --> 44:43.700
saying
"Did you hear what Midge did

44:43.770 --> 44:45.770
to Joel's balls
the other night?"

44:48.940 --> 44:50.640
I can't believe
this is happening.

44:50.700 --> 44:54.610
I can't believe I'm
losing him to Penny Pan.

44:54.680 --> 44:56.840
That's her name.
Terrible, right?

44:56.910 --> 44:59.810
Penny Pan. Penny Pan.

44:59.880 --> 45:02.150
Penny Pan.

45:02.220 --> 45:04.220
And I'm officially
losing my mind,

45:04.290 --> 45:05.420
which is perfect.

45:05.490 --> 45:07.290
Now I will be alone and crazy,

45:07.350 --> 45:11.260
the famous mad divorcée
of the upper West Side.

45:12.660 --> 45:14.660
Upper West Side?
Really? Where?

45:14.730 --> 45:15.660
72nd and Amsterdam.

45:15.730 --> 45:16.930
That place on the corner

45:17.000 --> 45:18.230
- with the courtyard?
- That's the one.

45:18.300 --> 45:19.770
Oh, that's nice.
We looked there.

45:19.830 --> 45:21.070
But the closets were so small,

45:21.140 --> 45:23.040
and I wanted a powder room.

45:23.100 --> 45:24.640
Do you know
I've seen her twice

45:24.710 --> 45:26.170
with her shirt on inside out?

45:26.240 --> 45:27.510
Penny. Twice.

45:27.570 --> 45:30.010
Once, fine. You were
rushed in the morning.

45:30.080 --> 45:31.880
Trusted, you can
only be trusted

45:31.950 --> 45:33.920
to butter people's corn
at the county fair.

45:33.980 --> 45:36.020
And here's the worst thing.

45:36.080 --> 45:40.750
And I know this is shallow
and petty and small,

45:40.820 --> 45:42.790
but she's not
even that pretty.

45:42.860 --> 45:43.960
Man: Huh.

45:44.030 --> 45:45.660
Her ankles and her calves

45:45.730 --> 45:47.490
are the same width.

45:47.560 --> 45:49.260
And I'm sorry, but look at me.

45:49.330 --> 45:52.900
I am the same size now
that I was at my wedding.

45:52.970 --> 45:54.640
And come on, who wouldn't
want to come home

45:54.700 --> 45:56.300
to this every night?

45:56.370 --> 45:57.940
Okay. All right.

45:58.010 --> 45:59.570
Maybe today's not
the best day to judge.

45:59.640 --> 46:01.840
I've been crying,
and my face is all puffy,

46:01.910 --> 46:03.810
and just... just...

46:03.880 --> 46:06.050
Ignore my head.
Now, from here down,

46:06.110 --> 46:09.080
who wouldn't want
to come home to this?

46:09.150 --> 46:10.720
Actually, I'm a little
bloated right now.

46:10.780 --> 46:13.490
I drank a lot of wine,
and my stomach is sort of...

46:13.550 --> 46:14.890
Oh, can... can I borrow that?

46:14.960 --> 46:16.820
Thank you.

46:16.890 --> 46:19.360
Okay. Ignore this,
ignore this.

46:19.430 --> 46:23.300
But imagine coming home
to these every night.

46:23.360 --> 46:24.500
Whoo!

46:24.570 --> 46:25.800
Yeah.

46:25.870 --> 46:28.070
Yeah, they're
pretty good, right?

46:28.140 --> 46:31.410
Plus they're standing up
on their own.

46:34.910 --> 46:35.940
- Shit.
- Seriously,

46:36.010 --> 46:38.150
there's no fucking way

46:38.210 --> 46:42.450
that Penny Pan can
compete with these tits!

46:42.520 --> 46:44.850
So what if you're never going
to be a stand-up comedian.

46:44.920 --> 46:46.250
Look at what
greets you at the door.

46:46.320 --> 46:48.060
- Shit.
- Get down from
there right now.

46:48.120 --> 46:50.390
You think Bob Newhart's
got a set of these at home?

46:50.460 --> 46:52.190
Rickles, maybe.

46:52.260 --> 46:53.790
Aah! Hey!

46:53.860 --> 46:54.930
Let's go.

46:56.060 --> 46:58.400
- Hey, fuck Penny Pan!
- Bravo!

46:59.730 --> 47:01.140
This is not what you think.

47:01.200 --> 47:03.470
She's a housewife.
She doesn't know the rules.

47:03.540 --> 47:05.240
Yeah, yeah. We can discuss
it at the station.

47:05.310 --> 47:06.870
- Station? What station?
- Come on.

47:06.940 --> 47:08.380
Come back next week!

47:08.440 --> 47:09.840
I don't understand
what's going on.

47:09.910 --> 47:10.980
You're under arrest.

47:11.050 --> 47:13.050
- What? Why?
- Public indecency

47:13.110 --> 47:14.520
and performing without
a cabaret license.

47:14.580 --> 47:16.380
You need a license
to do that? Seriously?

47:16.450 --> 47:18.020

bitch all about it

47:18.090 --> 47:19.590
to your friend
in the back seat there.

47:19.650 --> 47:20.690
- Go ahead.
- Get in there.

47:20.750 --> 47:22.590
Hey! Hey! Hey!

47:26.190 --> 47:27.560
Hey.

47:27.630 --> 47:28.900
Hi.

47:36.000 --> 47:37.500
Here you go.

47:37.570 --> 47:39.610
Thanks, Judy.

47:39.670 --> 47:40.980
You bailed me out?

47:41.040 --> 47:42.810
My good deed for the year.

47:42.880 --> 47:44.410
You get chick raped?

47:44.480 --> 47:45.850
I don't think so.

47:45.910 --> 47:47.680
- Here.
- It's still night out.

47:47.750 --> 47:48.850
Yep.

47:48.920 --> 47:50.150
I feel different.

47:50.220 --> 47:51.720
You were in there
for 20 minutes.

47:51.790 --> 47:53.190
20 minutes
can change you.

47:53.250 --> 47:54.760
- Not really.
- I'm a con now.

47:54.820 --> 47:56.690
- Not quite.
- I've got a rap sheet.

47:56.760 --> 47:58.430
- No, you don't.
- I'm hard.

47:58.490 --> 48:01.730
I'm a hard, used woman.
Is my hair gray?

48:01.800 --> 48:03.300
- No, it's not.
- It feels gray.

48:03.360 --> 48:04.400

48:04.470 --> 48:05.370

48:05.430 --> 48:07.170

upset about your husband,

48:44.670 --> 48:46.610
don't be. The guy was
a fraud and a loser.

48:46.670 --> 48:49.540
- You don't know him.
- I know he was doing
Bob Newhart's act.

48:49.610 --> 48:51.410
Everybody steals, right?

48:51.480 --> 48:52.710
You didn't.

48:52.780 --> 48:54.520

48:54.580 --> 48:55.980

48:56.050 --> 48:57.180
Steal. You didn't steal.

48:57.250 --> 48:58.450
Your shit
was totally original.

48:58.520 --> 49:00.250
Don't get me wrong.
It was rough,

49:00.320 --> 49:02.390
but I'm telling you,
there is definitely
something there.

49:02.460 --> 49:04.090
I'm thinking maybe
we can meet somewhere,

49:04.160 --> 49:05.560
bigger club, if I could
just get Baz to die.

49:05.630 --> 49:08.030
- What are you talking about?
- About your act.

49:08.100 --> 49:09.160
I don't have an act.

49:09.230 --> 49:11.200
You will when we're done.

49:11.270 --> 49:12.630
I don't understand.

49:12.700 --> 49:16.470
You should do standup,
and I can help you.

49:16.540 --> 49:18.840
- Oh, come on.
- I'm serious.

49:18.910 --> 49:21.040
- I am a mother.
- Great. We'll use that.

49:21.110 --> 49:22.310
One of your kids
do something weird?

49:22.380 --> 49:24.080
Tonight was
an isolated incident.

49:24.150 --> 49:25.550
There are medications
I can take

49:25.610 --> 49:27.480
to make sure that never
happens again.

49:28.620 --> 49:29.750
Look, 15 years

49:29.820 --> 49:31.290
I've been working
in clubs, okay?

49:31.350 --> 49:33.250
15 years watching
every kind of loser

49:33.320 --> 49:34.590
get up there
thinking he's Jack Benny.

49:34.660 --> 49:37.190
Twice have I seen someone
deliver the goods.

49:37.260 --> 49:38.660
First time, guy walks in...

49:38.730 --> 49:42.130
West Coast, suntanned,
arrogant pain in the ass.

49:42.200 --> 49:44.230
Three words into his act,
I fucking knew it.

49:44.300 --> 49:46.770
I turned to Baz, and I said,
"That guy's gonna be famous."

49:46.830 --> 49:48.300
- Who was he?
- Mort SAHL.

49:48.370 --> 49:50.970
Oh, he's good. We saw him
at Grossinger's last year.

49:51.040 --> 49:53.310
Yeah, well, the second
time was tonight.

49:53.370 --> 49:55.010
Stop it.

49:55.080 --> 49:57.380
I know I'm right about this,

49:57.440 --> 49:59.610
just like I know that unless
I somehow get rich enough

49:59.680 --> 50:02.050
to hire some German broad
to walk me around the park

50:02.120 --> 50:03.280
twice a day in my old age,

50:03.350 --> 50:04.920
I'm gonna spend
my entire life alone.

50:04.990 --> 50:06.190
That's not true.

50:06.250 --> 50:09.490
It's fine. I don't mind
being alone.

50:09.560 --> 50:12.960
I just do not want
to be insignificant.

50:13.030 --> 50:14.200
Do you?

50:15.630 --> 50:17.500
Don't you want to do
something no one else can do?

50:17.560 --> 50:19.730
Be remembered as something
other than a mother

50:19.800 --> 50:22.270
or a housewife or member
of the Communist Party?

50:22.340 --> 50:24.510
When did I become a member
of the Communist Party?

50:24.570 --> 50:25.940
The minute
you took that flyer.

50:26.010 --> 50:28.640
What? Shit.

50:28.710 --> 50:30.010
Oh, no.

50:30.080 --> 50:31.710
No, no, no, no, no.

50:31.780 --> 50:34.220
It's Yom Kippur. I'm
supposed to be fasting,

50:34.280 --> 50:36.080
atoning for my sins
in the eyes of God.
