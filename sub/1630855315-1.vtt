00:35.035 --> 00:40.123
[***]

00:46.838 --> 00:50.800
[***]

01:05.940 --> 01:09.361
[***]

01:11.237 --> 01:12.238
Is this
where you try to stab me?

01:12.989 --> 01:14.074
[laughs]

01:14.115 --> 01:15.575
Just help me up.

01:17.619 --> 01:18.661
Good job.

01:18.703 --> 01:19.788
Professor Lindo?

01:19.829 --> 01:21.956
Please continue, Miss Teagarden.

01:21.998 --> 01:23.083
Okay.

01:23.124 --> 01:24.876
So, the murderer told police

01:24.918 --> 01:26.252
that his victim, Barbara Evans,

01:26.294 --> 01:27.754
tried to stab him
with a pair of scissors

01:27.796 --> 01:29.422
while hiding under a desk,

01:29.464 --> 01:31.174
and his lawyers
claimed self-defense,

01:31.216 --> 01:32.759
but who can tell me

01:32.801 --> 01:33.677
why that doesn't match up

01:33.718 --> 01:34.844
with the facts

01:34.886 --> 01:36.471
the author presents
in this book?

01:36.513 --> 01:38.848
Yes!

01:38.890 --> 01:40.183
Great job today.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.143
[student] Thank you so much.

01:44.688 --> 01:46.523
Well done, Miss Teagarden.

01:46.564 --> 01:47.732
You really had them
paying attention

01:47.774 --> 01:48.817
with that re-enactment.

01:48.858 --> 01:50.443
I certainly picked
the right person

01:50.485 --> 01:51.653
to be my teaching assistant.

01:51.695 --> 01:53.238
Well, thanks.

01:53.279 --> 01:54.489
I really try
to picture the scene

01:54.531 --> 01:56.449
when I read true crime,
you know,

01:56.491 --> 01:57.826
like trying to figure out
what really happened

01:57.867 --> 01:59.285
is kinda like therapy to me.

01:59.327 --> 02:00.412
Hmm.

02:00.453 --> 02:02.706
Yeah, that makes sense to me.

02:02.747 --> 02:04.290
You know, I am very curious

02:04.332 --> 02:07.210
to see what topic you settle on
for your master's thesis.

02:07.252 --> 02:09.796
You know, your deadline
to turn that in to me

02:09.838 --> 02:11.464
is next Friday.

02:11.506 --> 02:13.299
Well, after reading your book
on the Laci Peterson case,

02:13.341 --> 02:15.510
and all that stuff

02:15.552 --> 02:16.720
about how the prosecutor
would test out his theories

02:16.761 --> 02:17.887
on Internet message boards,

02:17.929 --> 02:19.723
I was thinking something like,

02:19.764 --> 02:21.766
"The impact of amateur sleuths
on the justice system."

02:21.808 --> 02:24.310
Hmm, that's a good start.

02:24.352 --> 02:26.271
I know, I need to do
more research,

02:26.312 --> 02:27.731
but I can't this week,

02:27.772 --> 02:29.607
not with starting that new job
at the diner,

02:29.649 --> 02:31.151
and trying to keep
my friend, Sally, sane

02:31.192 --> 02:32.193
before her wedding.

02:33.653 --> 02:35.363
Speaking of which,
I should get going.

02:35.405 --> 02:37.032
Uh, burgers or bride?

02:37.073 --> 02:38.658
Burgers.

02:38.700 --> 02:39.868
Great.

02:42.620 --> 02:46.708
[***]

02:50.045 --> 02:51.963
Do we have steamed broccoli?

02:53.465 --> 02:54.549
Uh, yeah.

02:56.051 --> 02:57.010
You must be the new server.

02:57.052 --> 02:58.219
I'm Daniel.

02:59.220 --> 03:01.639
Oh!
Hey, um, I'm Roe.

03:01.681 --> 03:06.227
Um, is there some abbreviation
I should use?

03:06.269 --> 03:09.647
Officially, it's B-R-O-C,
but "BR" works, too.

03:09.689 --> 03:10.899
After 12 years here,

03:10.940 --> 03:13.026
I've got abbreviations
for the abbreviations.

03:13.068 --> 03:15.195
12 years. Wow.

03:15.236 --> 03:16.905
Yeah, the owner is kinda like
a dad to me,

03:16.946 --> 03:18.031
and it's a pretty good gig.

03:18.073 --> 03:18.823
[dings order bell]

03:23.787 --> 03:24.996
[man] Roe Teagarden?

03:25.038 --> 03:26.498
Oh!

03:28.041 --> 03:29.793
Arthur!

03:29.834 --> 03:31.002
Hey!

03:31.044 --> 03:32.754
Here, let me help you out here.

03:34.923 --> 03:35.757
Um, this is for you.

03:36.883 --> 03:38.385
Enjoy.

03:38.426 --> 03:39.427
[Arthur] I knew you'd be
back in town

03:39.469 --> 03:40.637
for Sally's wedding,

03:40.679 --> 03:42.597
I just didn't expect
to run into you here.

03:42.639 --> 03:43.390
I thought you were living
in Seattle

03:43.431 --> 03:44.557
working on your Master's.

03:44.599 --> 03:46.351
Well, I was.
I did my first year there,

03:46.393 --> 03:47.686
but then I found out

03:47.727 --> 03:49.020
that the Library Science program
at Lawrenceton U

03:49.062 --> 03:51.773
offers a specialization
in true-crime literature,

03:51.815 --> 03:52.941
so here I am,

03:52.982 --> 03:54.651
working two jobs
for tuition money.

03:54.693 --> 03:56.444
Mondays and Wednesdays as a TA,

03:56.486 --> 03:57.821
and then another
three days a week here.

03:57.862 --> 03:58.905
True Crime, huh?

03:58.947 --> 04:00.699
Classic Roe.

04:00.740 --> 04:03.410
I remember you carrying around
true-crime books in high school,

04:03.451 --> 04:04.536
reading them between classes.

04:05.412 --> 04:06.996
Still my M.O..

04:07.038 --> 04:08.248
Just finished this one.

04:08.289 --> 04:11.251
Assigned reading
for the undergrads I teach.

04:11.292 --> 04:12.836
"Quest for Justice:
The Killing of Barbara Evans."

04:12.877 --> 04:14.212
Interesting.

04:14.254 --> 04:15.964
-Take it.
-Yeah?

04:16.006 --> 04:17.257
Yeah, I think you'd like it,

04:17.298 --> 04:18.633
and, obviously,

04:18.675 --> 04:20.343
you're in the crime-solving
business these days.

04:21.803 --> 04:23.722
The uniform
looks good on you, Arthur.

04:23.763 --> 04:24.889
Oh, thanks.

04:24.931 --> 04:26.391
I, uh...

04:26.433 --> 04:28.476
Yeah, if you're going to be
working here, um...

04:28.518 --> 04:31.271
you'll be seeing me in it a lot.

04:31.312 --> 04:32.689
Yeah, me and my compadres,

04:32.731 --> 04:35.191
we like to eat here
after our shift is over, so...

04:35.233 --> 04:36.776
[order bell dings]

04:36.818 --> 04:37.819
I've got food up,

04:37.861 --> 04:38.862
but will I see you

04:38.903 --> 04:40.405
at Sally's wedding
kick-off party?

04:40.447 --> 04:41.489
I'll be there.

04:41.531 --> 04:43.366
Okay.

04:47.579 --> 04:49.330
[whispering] "Compadres..."

04:51.416 --> 04:53.460
[***]

05:07.349 --> 05:08.725
[Aida] Aurora?

05:08.767 --> 05:11.311
Oh, thank goodness you're here.

05:11.353 --> 05:13.146
You know, we have to leave
for Sally's party

05:13.188 --> 05:14.064
in less than an hour,

05:14.105 --> 05:14.856
so you--

05:16.024 --> 05:17.067
Honey, um...

05:17.108 --> 05:18.068
please don't sit
on the couch

05:18.109 --> 05:20.695
with those soiled diner clothes.

05:20.737 --> 05:21.780
I can smell the grease
from here.

05:21.821 --> 05:23.365
Yes, Mother.

05:23.406 --> 05:24.908
You know, I barely had time
to stop at the gym

05:24.949 --> 05:26.493
after the office,

05:26.534 --> 05:28.453
and then, I had to bring home
insurance audits

05:28.495 --> 05:29.913
to work on after the party.

05:29.954 --> 05:31.247
You brought work home again?

05:31.289 --> 05:32.332
Mm-hmm.

05:32.374 --> 05:33.500
You know, I took this temp job

05:33.541 --> 05:35.293
because I wanted to keep
the lights on

05:35.335 --> 05:36.252
at the real-estate office,

05:36.294 --> 05:37.712
but at this point,

05:37.754 --> 05:40.006
I have sold more boat insurance
than I have houses.

05:40.048 --> 05:42.008
I'm sure
that'll turn around soon.

05:42.050 --> 05:44.010
Maybe I should just...

05:44.052 --> 05:45.303
close the office
and admit defeat.

05:45.345 --> 05:46.805
Mother, no.

05:46.846 --> 05:48.807
You have worked years
to start your own agency.

05:48.848 --> 05:50.392
You can't just give up
on your dream.

05:50.433 --> 05:53.478
Yeah, well, I call it
being more realistic.

05:53.520 --> 05:55.522
[doorbell rings]

05:57.607 --> 05:58.942
-Hey, Sally.
-Hi.

05:58.983 --> 06:00.151
I know we're early,

06:00.193 --> 06:01.152
but Matt has some things
he needs to do

06:01.194 --> 06:02.153
before the party, so...

06:02.195 --> 06:03.405
Hey, Aurora.

06:03.446 --> 06:04.447
Thanks for giving her
a ride today.

06:04.489 --> 06:05.615
[Roe] Of course.

06:05.657 --> 06:06.449
What else
is a Maid of Honor for?

06:06.491 --> 06:07.867
See you there?

06:07.909 --> 06:08.910
Hello, Aida!

06:08.952 --> 06:10.286
Oh, hello, Matt!

06:10.328 --> 06:11.496
-See you.
-Bye.

06:11.538 --> 06:13.289
[Sally]
I don't know why I thought

06:13.331 --> 06:14.457
throwing a party
three days before the wedding

06:14.499 --> 06:15.750
was a good idea.

06:15.792 --> 06:17.836
[Aida]
It was a great idea, Sally.

06:17.877 --> 06:18.878
[Sally] Oh, no.

06:18.920 --> 06:20.714
I forgot to tell Matt

06:20.755 --> 06:22.632
that Aunt Gladys doesn't want
to be picked up till 7:30!

06:22.674 --> 06:24.801
It's okay, I'll go tell him.

06:25.927 --> 06:27.554
Matt?

06:29.639 --> 06:30.557
Matt!

06:34.853 --> 06:38.940
[***]

06:44.446 --> 06:46.823
[car engine starting]

06:57.250 --> 06:58.418
Sally, I'm sorry.

06:58.460 --> 06:59.627
I couldn't catch Matt.

06:59.669 --> 07:01.755
He was gone
by the time I got outside.

07:01.796 --> 07:04.132
Oh, not to worry,
I can go pick up Gladys.

07:04.174 --> 07:05.550
I mean, she and I haven't
seen each other for a while,

07:05.592 --> 07:06.760
so it'll be fun to catch up.

07:06.801 --> 07:08.178
Thank you, Aida.

07:08.219 --> 07:09.429
I'll send Matt a text.

07:09.471 --> 07:10.555
[Aida] Okay.

07:10.597 --> 07:12.182
So this is very eye-catching.

07:12.223 --> 07:13.892
I mean, really, Sally,

07:13.933 --> 07:16.895
your interior-design blog
is very impressive.

07:16.936 --> 07:18.021
Yeah, you know,
Matt could make one of these

07:18.063 --> 07:19.939
for your real-estate office.

07:19.981 --> 07:21.775
Yeah, maybe.

07:21.816 --> 07:22.609
You know, this isn't
how I thought I would use

07:22.650 --> 07:23.777
my journalism degree,

07:23.818 --> 07:25.570
but Matt's been so encouraging,

07:25.612 --> 07:26.946
and my email list
is growing, so...

07:26.988 --> 07:28.948
So you actually
finished your degree?

07:28.990 --> 07:30.784
Well, not technically.

07:30.825 --> 07:33.536
I still have six credits to go.

07:33.578 --> 07:34.537
Did I tell you guys?

07:34.579 --> 07:36.206
Matt and Carson
got a huge offer

07:36.247 --> 07:37.040
to buy their company.

07:37.082 --> 07:38.291
Wow!

07:38.333 --> 07:40.251
For their web-platform thing?

07:40.293 --> 07:41.169
Megablog?

07:41.211 --> 07:42.462
It's Giggoblog,

07:42.504 --> 07:43.797
and, yeah,
it's a big money offer

07:43.838 --> 07:44.964
that's supposed to go through
next week.

07:45.006 --> 07:46.424
Oh, congratulations!

07:46.466 --> 07:47.676
Thank you.

07:47.717 --> 07:49.094
Now, um,

07:49.135 --> 07:51.221
I'd better go look for something
to wear to the party.

07:51.262 --> 07:52.263
You too.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.724
[sighs]

07:55.850 --> 07:56.768
[chuckles]

07:59.354 --> 08:01.147
Wanna see my blog?

08:01.189 --> 08:03.149
Over here.

08:03.191 --> 08:04.984
Just don't tell my mother
I'm sitting on the couch.

08:05.026 --> 08:05.985
Deal.

08:06.027 --> 08:07.487
I love her,

08:07.529 --> 08:08.655
and I am lucky to have
a rent-free place to live,

08:08.697 --> 08:09.739
but it is not so easy

08:09.781 --> 08:10.990
moving back in with your mom

08:11.032 --> 08:13.993
after being on your own
for eight years.

08:14.035 --> 08:15.078
She still treats me

08:15.120 --> 08:16.079
like I'm barely
out of high school.

08:16.121 --> 08:17.038
At my bridal shower,

08:17.080 --> 08:18.248
she kept asking me

08:18.289 --> 08:20.000
why I was "rushing"
to the altar,

08:20.041 --> 08:22.002
but then again, a lot of people
have been asking me that.

08:22.043 --> 08:25.255
Well, I mean,
it did happen kinda fast.

08:25.296 --> 08:26.339
I mean, that concert
where you met

08:26.381 --> 08:27.549
was, like, what,
seven months ago?

08:27.590 --> 08:29.259
Please tell me
my Maid of Honor

08:29.300 --> 08:30.343
is not a doubter, too?

08:30.385 --> 08:32.178
No, no, not a doubter.

08:32.220 --> 08:33.555
I am definitely Team Matt.

08:33.596 --> 08:35.056
I've never seen you this happy.

08:35.098 --> 08:36.975
I am so happy,

08:37.017 --> 08:39.769
and you moving home

08:39.811 --> 08:41.813
is the cherry on top.

08:41.855 --> 08:43.565
All right, show me
the wonders of your blog.

08:46.735 --> 08:47.902
I just have to ask you,

08:47.944 --> 08:49.237
is that
what you're going to wear?

08:49.279 --> 08:50.947
[groans]
Okay, I'm changing.

08:50.989 --> 08:52.032
She said it--

08:52.073 --> 08:53.533
Sally, Mother,
everyone in this house--

08:53.575 --> 08:54.826
I'm changing!

08:54.868 --> 09:00.957
* This heart has waited... *

09:03.001 --> 09:05.003
[Sally]
Well, what do you think, Roe?

09:05.045 --> 09:06.046
Wow, Sally,

09:06.087 --> 09:08.381
this place really is
quite the venue.

09:08.423 --> 09:09.799
When I was little,

09:09.841 --> 09:11.468
my Grammy and I
used to come here for tea

09:11.509 --> 09:12.385
every month.

09:12.427 --> 09:13.553
Aw...

09:13.595 --> 09:15.263
I knew when I was nine

09:15.305 --> 09:17.557
this would be the perfect place
to have my wedding.

09:17.599 --> 09:18.767
[Roe] Well, it's beautiful,

09:18.808 --> 09:20.518
and you did
an incredible job decorating.

09:20.560 --> 09:21.936
I hope you took
lots of pictures for the blog.

09:21.978 --> 09:23.313
[Sally] Oh, yeah,
Matt already did,

09:23.355 --> 09:24.981
and he already
uploaded everything.

09:25.023 --> 09:26.399
I honestly think

09:26.441 --> 09:27.692
he could do anything
with the Internet.

09:27.734 --> 09:29.402
Yeah, you gotta watch out
for my brother.

09:29.444 --> 09:30.737
He once hacked into
the college website

09:30.779 --> 09:32.530
just to prove to the professor
that he could.

09:32.572 --> 09:33.865
[laughing]

09:33.907 --> 09:34.991
Hey, Kara, you want
to help me with these?

09:35.033 --> 09:35.950
Yeah, I'd love to.

09:35.992 --> 09:37.285
-Oops!
-Thanks.

09:37.327 --> 09:38.870
-I'll take some.
-Thank you.

09:38.912 --> 09:40.372
I wish there could be
a placecard for my mom.

09:40.413 --> 09:41.748
She just...

09:41.790 --> 09:43.416
she would have loved to see
Matt get married.

09:43.458 --> 09:44.459
Oh!

09:44.501 --> 09:45.919
Your mom died?

09:45.960 --> 09:47.545
-I'm so sorry, I had no idea.
-Oh, no, no, no...

09:47.587 --> 09:49.756
I mean, I know your dad passed
when you guys were young, but...

09:49.798 --> 09:52.300
Yeah, Matt was only 15
when she passed,

09:52.342 --> 09:54.928
but, Sally, I can't tell you
how much it means to me

09:54.969 --> 09:57.847
that we get to be part
of the beautiful Allison clan,

09:57.889 --> 09:59.099
and I just love you so much!

09:59.140 --> 10:00.100
Oh...

10:00.141 --> 10:01.267
-Hey!
-Roe!

10:01.309 --> 10:02.602
I gotta thank you
for lending me that book,

10:02.644 --> 10:04.187
the one on the Evans' murder.

10:04.229 --> 10:05.814
I'm two chapters in already.
It's great.

10:05.855 --> 10:07.399
Right?
I couldn't put it down.

10:07.440 --> 10:09.317
Yeah, no, that lead detective
is quite a character.

10:09.359 --> 10:10.735
I think that's
what I want to do,

10:10.777 --> 10:12.320
make my way up to detective.

10:12.362 --> 10:13.530
I'm actually already assigned

10:13.571 --> 10:14.864
to our homicide detective's
detail.

10:14.906 --> 10:16.533
Arthur!
That's amazing!

10:16.574 --> 10:19.160
Oh, I can't wait
to hear your stories.

10:19.202 --> 10:20.203
[Arthur] Ladies!
Lovely to see you both.

10:20.245 --> 10:21.454
Hi.

10:21.496 --> 10:23.081
There you are, darling girl.

10:23.123 --> 10:24.207
You're home.

10:24.249 --> 10:25.166
[Arthur] Can I offer you
some champagne?

10:25.208 --> 10:26.793
-I'd love some.
-Yes.

10:26.835 --> 10:29.045
Oh, your mother must be
over the moon.

10:29.087 --> 10:29.921
Are you kidding?

10:29.963 --> 10:31.131
Her mother is thrilled.

10:31.172 --> 10:32.799
I missed her so much.

10:32.841 --> 10:34.134
[Roe] Yes, it's like
I never left.

10:34.175 --> 10:35.176
Oh...

10:35.218 --> 10:36.094
[laughing]

10:36.136 --> 10:38.096
Aurora! Hey.

10:38.138 --> 10:39.347
I want to introduce you
to someone.

10:39.389 --> 10:42.017
Maid of honor, the best man.

10:42.058 --> 10:43.685
Aurora Teagarden,
Carson Hayford.

10:43.727 --> 10:44.978
Nice to meet you.
I've heard a lot about you.

10:45.020 --> 10:46.396
You as well.

10:46.438 --> 10:47.439
I'm glad we're finally getting
this show on the road.

10:47.480 --> 10:48.815
Mm-hmm!

10:48.857 --> 10:49.816
Oh, yeah, nothing's
going to keep these two

10:49.858 --> 10:50.942
from getting together.
[chuckles]

10:50.984 --> 10:52.986
Mind if I steal Matt
for a second?

10:53.028 --> 10:54.696
Duty calls.

10:58.867 --> 11:00.201
Hi!

11:04.998 --> 11:06.291
[Arthur]
Well, it's great to see you,

11:06.332 --> 11:07.459
it really is.

11:07.500 --> 11:08.877
So I keep hearing

11:08.918 --> 11:10.337
that Matt and Carson
are about to be millionaires?

11:10.378 --> 11:11.755
Mm-hmm.

11:11.796 --> 11:14.716
Sally's found love
and also enviable security.

11:14.758 --> 11:16.259
And so quickly.

11:16.301 --> 11:17.719
Well, maybe you can find them
an enviable home to buy,

11:17.761 --> 11:18.762
and quickly.

11:18.803 --> 11:19.971
And quickly.

11:20.013 --> 11:21.681
[man shouting]
Where's Matt Walker?

11:21.723 --> 11:24.434
Walker, you owe me,

11:24.476 --> 11:25.852
and I'm gonna make sure you pay!

11:25.894 --> 11:27.437
[Matt] Take it easy.
Take it easy.

11:27.479 --> 11:29.022
Hey, can we do something
about that?

11:29.064 --> 11:30.357
-[Matt] Get off me!
-Hey, what's going on?

11:30.398 --> 11:31.691
[man] I'm going!

11:31.733 --> 11:32.692
[Matt] Nothing's happening,
it's all right.

11:32.734 --> 11:33.860
I'm coming after you.

11:41.993 --> 11:43.411
-Who was that?
-I don't know.

11:43.453 --> 11:45.372
I've never seen him before.

11:45.413 --> 11:46.623
[Roe] What?

11:46.664 --> 11:48.083
That doesn't make sense

11:48.124 --> 11:49.959
for a stranger
to confront you like that?

11:50.001 --> 11:51.628
Yeah, and what did he mean
he's coming after you?

11:51.670 --> 11:54.047
I have no idea.

11:54.089 --> 11:56.299
Honestly, that was
the weirdest thing

11:56.341 --> 11:57.342
that's ever happened to me,

11:57.384 --> 11:58.885
aside from that stray dog

11:58.927 --> 12:00.595
jumping in my car that one time?

12:00.637 --> 12:01.888
He was trying
to come home with me.

12:01.930 --> 12:02.931
It was probably his owner.
[giggling]

12:02.972 --> 12:04.265
Yes, it probably was.

12:12.232 --> 12:13.525
Everyone's staring.

12:15.777 --> 12:17.737
Everyone, attention?

12:17.779 --> 12:18.905
If you haven't found
a glass of champagne,

12:18.947 --> 12:20.448
it's time to pick one up.

12:23.743 --> 12:24.911
Thank you.

12:27.163 --> 12:28.206
[Roe] To Sally,

12:28.248 --> 12:30.583
my best friend
and my chosen sister.

12:30.625 --> 12:33.044
I remember in freshman English

12:33.086 --> 12:34.921
when all the stories you wrote

12:34.963 --> 12:36.589
always had some kind of
love story in them.

12:36.631 --> 12:38.591
[everyone chuckling]

12:38.633 --> 12:39.926
So it's pretty surreal

12:39.968 --> 12:42.178
to see you live out
your own love story now

12:42.220 --> 12:44.347
with someone
who not only gets you,

12:44.389 --> 12:45.306
but also supports your work.

12:46.599 --> 12:48.935
You okay?

12:48.977 --> 12:50.186
Yeah.
Yeah, I'm great.

12:54.983 --> 12:56.901
To the bride and groom,

12:56.943 --> 12:58.695
and their happily ever after!

12:58.737 --> 13:00.447
[everyone repeating]
To the bride and groom!

13:00.488 --> 13:02.449
[glasses clinking]

13:11.499 --> 13:13.209
[chuckling]

13:13.251 --> 13:14.753
And I expect
a phone call from you

13:14.794 --> 13:16.880
if you plan on
staying out late, okay?

13:16.921 --> 13:20.091
Mother, how about we pretend
I'm actually an adult now?

13:20.133 --> 13:21.426
Or how about we pretend

13:21.468 --> 13:23.636
that you actually like
my fussing over you

13:23.678 --> 13:25.305
because you know
how much I've missed it.

13:25.347 --> 13:27.557
Yes, I love you.

13:27.599 --> 13:29.225
I love you, too.

13:29.267 --> 13:30.518
Have fun.
Don't stay out too late.

13:30.560 --> 13:31.644
Yeah, yeah.

13:31.686 --> 13:33.355
I love you, Mother.

13:35.440 --> 13:37.359
Are you kidding?

13:37.400 --> 13:38.485
Hey!

13:38.526 --> 13:39.819
Who is that woman?

13:39.861 --> 13:42.238
I saw her
outside my house earlier.

13:43.698 --> 13:45.617
That is Matt's ex-girlfriend.

13:46.701 --> 13:48.495
Dawn Palmer.

13:48.536 --> 13:49.537
She's gone stalker on him.

13:49.579 --> 13:50.663
Crashed his bachelor party,

13:50.705 --> 13:52.374
and I had to run interference.

13:52.415 --> 13:53.375
Does Sally know about her?

13:53.416 --> 13:54.668
I don't know.

13:54.709 --> 13:57.170
Dawn's a pain,
but basically harmless.

13:57.212 --> 13:59.005
Matt thinks once he's married,
she'll knock it off.

13:59.047 --> 14:00.423
Stalking is a crime.

14:00.465 --> 14:02.133
Why doesn't he just report her
to the police?

14:03.510 --> 14:05.512
Not my circus, not my monkeys.

14:14.104 --> 14:15.980
I thought you were going
to drive me home.

14:16.022 --> 14:18.358
I know, I just, I had
a little too much to drink,

14:18.400 --> 14:19.984
so I...

14:20.026 --> 14:21.736
I'm gonna take a cab,
sleep it off.

14:21.778 --> 14:24.364
I'll call you in the morning?

14:24.406 --> 14:25.573
I'm sorry.

14:28.118 --> 14:28.993
Okay.

14:29.035 --> 14:30.495
Good night, Matt.

14:31.871 --> 14:34.374
Hey, how you doing?

14:34.416 --> 14:36.209
Matt hasn't been himself
all evening.

14:36.251 --> 14:38.545
[laughs]
Oh, don't worry about it.

14:38.586 --> 14:40.463
He always gets a little nervous
before big events,

14:40.505 --> 14:41.715
and getting married

14:41.756 --> 14:43.008
is about as big an event
as it gets, so...

14:43.049 --> 14:44.050
it's gonna be fine.

14:44.092 --> 14:45.593
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

14:45.635 --> 14:46.761
[woman] Miss Allison,
do you have a minute, please?

14:46.803 --> 14:47.971
Oh, I...

14:48.013 --> 14:49.597
Yeah, no, you go do you.

14:50.682 --> 14:52.100
Hey...

14:52.142 --> 14:54.644
were you just saying that
to make her feel better,

14:54.686 --> 14:55.812
or do you actually think

14:55.854 --> 14:57.188
there's nothing
to be worried about?

14:57.230 --> 14:58.732
Maybe a little of both.

14:58.773 --> 14:59.733
I'm gonna take off.

14:59.774 --> 15:01.067
Hey, Sally!

15:01.109 --> 15:02.110
I'll see you
at the dress fitting.

15:02.152 --> 15:03.403
-[Sally] Bye, Kara.
-Love you.

15:03.445 --> 15:04.195
Bye.
Have a good one.

15:09.451 --> 15:12.078
Hi, friend.

15:12.120 --> 15:13.455
Do you remember
when you'd get super stressed

15:13.496 --> 15:14.706
before finals,

15:14.748 --> 15:15.749
so we'd have a sleepover,

15:15.790 --> 15:17.000
and you'd come over,

15:17.042 --> 15:19.044
and we'd study,
and then watch a movie?

15:19.085 --> 15:20.837
Want to spend the night?

15:20.879 --> 15:23.757
There's a new true-crime doc
I'm dying to see.

15:23.798 --> 15:24.758
True crime?

15:24.799 --> 15:27.093
Thank you, but no thank you.

15:27.135 --> 15:29.637
Anyways, I'm tired.

15:29.679 --> 15:30.638
I'll just see you
tomorrow, okay?

15:30.680 --> 15:32.140
I'll pick you up at the diner?

15:32.182 --> 15:33.099
Yeah.

15:33.141 --> 15:34.392
Dress fitting tomorrow.

15:34.434 --> 15:35.894
You got it.

15:35.935 --> 15:37.437
'Night, Sally.

15:37.479 --> 15:38.480
Good night.

15:41.816 --> 15:43.985
[***]

15:51.826 --> 15:53.161
What are you doing here?

15:53.203 --> 15:54.245
Oh, hey.

15:54.287 --> 15:55.455
I'm just meeting
a couple of friends.

15:56.790 --> 15:58.124
Is that a frittata?

15:58.166 --> 15:59.209
I didn't know we had that
on the menu.

15:59.250 --> 16:00.543
We don't.

16:00.585 --> 16:02.545
I just made it for me to eat
before we clock in.

16:02.587 --> 16:04.464
Want a taste?

16:04.506 --> 16:05.382
Sure.

16:09.844 --> 16:11.054
Wow.

16:11.096 --> 16:12.097
That is delicious.

16:12.138 --> 16:13.431
It should be.

16:13.473 --> 16:14.683
You're looking at
a culinary-school graduate.

16:15.850 --> 16:17.143
You're a chef?

16:17.185 --> 16:18.812
Then why are you...?

16:18.853 --> 16:21.189
Working in a diner?

16:21.231 --> 16:24.192
Emilio is the one
who paid for my training, so...

16:24.234 --> 16:26.486
how ungrateful would I be
to go work somewhere else?

16:28.822 --> 16:30.532
Okay, so my friend
is getting married on Saturday,

16:30.573 --> 16:32.033
and I promised

16:32.075 --> 16:33.993
I would make her and the other
bridesmaid breakfast,

16:34.035 --> 16:35.370
but maybe
I could bring them here

16:35.412 --> 16:37.664
and you could make
some of that instead?

16:37.706 --> 16:38.998
Yeah!

16:39.040 --> 16:40.417
Yeah, I'd love to cook
for your friends.

16:40.458 --> 16:41.209
Oh, thank you.

16:41.251 --> 16:42.836
You just made my day.

16:42.877 --> 16:44.295
-Arthur! Hi.
-Hey.

16:44.337 --> 16:45.839
Kinda early
for you to be in here.

16:45.880 --> 16:48.049
Ah, just grabbing
a quick coffee to go.

16:48.091 --> 16:50.218
Hey, uh, did you--

16:50.260 --> 16:52.387
did you think that party
was a bit weird last night?

16:52.429 --> 16:54.264
You mean
with the party crashers,

16:54.305 --> 16:55.682
stalkers,

16:55.724 --> 16:57.642
and the groom ditching the bride
at the end of the night?

16:57.684 --> 16:58.852
No, not weird at all.

16:58.893 --> 17:00.812
Wait, stalkers?
What stalkers?

17:00.854 --> 17:03.940
Dawn Palmer, Matt's ex.

17:03.982 --> 17:06.192
According to Carson,
she's basically harmless.

17:06.234 --> 17:07.610
Oh.

17:07.652 --> 17:09.904
Hey! What happened?

17:09.946 --> 17:11.156
Matt was supposed
to call me this morning,

17:11.197 --> 17:12.198
and he didn't.

17:12.240 --> 17:13.241
He's not answering the phone,

17:13.283 --> 17:14.284
and when I went to his condo,

17:14.325 --> 17:16.077
he didn't answer when I knocked,

17:16.119 --> 17:18.955
and I don't know
the door combination this month.

17:18.997 --> 17:20.206
It changes every month.

17:20.248 --> 17:22.208
And he's not replying
to my texts either.

17:22.250 --> 17:24.085
[Sally] I'm so worried.

17:24.127 --> 17:26.087
Do you think I should file
a missing person's report?

17:26.129 --> 17:27.797
Can't do that until
he's been missing 24 hours,

17:27.839 --> 17:29.090
but try not to worry too much.

17:29.132 --> 17:30.550
Every year,

17:30.592 --> 17:32.218
the department gets one or two
missing groom cases.

17:32.260 --> 17:35.096
They always turn up, Sal.

17:35.138 --> 17:37.349
Yeah, I'm sure Matt's
just off working on his vows.

17:37.390 --> 17:39.100
Let's go
to your dress fitting, and--

17:39.142 --> 17:40.393
I think Kara
should just go with me.

17:40.435 --> 17:42.771
I want you to try to find Matt.

17:42.812 --> 17:44.064
Do you remember

17:44.105 --> 17:45.565
when you found my lost cat
in 10th grade?

17:45.607 --> 17:48.193
Or the time that you found
my finals paper

17:48.234 --> 17:49.694
for U.S. History?

17:49.736 --> 17:51.780
You're really good at
finding things, Roe.

17:51.821 --> 17:54.532
You always have been.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.242
Okay, I'll try.

17:56.284 --> 17:57.619
[Arthur] I can help.

17:57.660 --> 17:59.454
I don't start my shift
for another hour, so...

17:59.496 --> 18:01.164
[Kara] Thank you, both of you.

18:01.206 --> 18:02.832
Thank you so much.

18:02.874 --> 18:06.503
Sally, let's go get you
into your beautiful dress.

18:06.544 --> 18:07.420
Thank you.

18:07.462 --> 18:08.713
[Kara] It's going to be okay.

18:10.340 --> 18:12.050
Not sure
where to start, though.

18:12.092 --> 18:14.344
We should go to Matt's,
see if we can get in.

18:14.386 --> 18:16.262
How are we going to get in
if Sally can't get in?

18:17.889 --> 18:19.140
I don't know,

18:19.182 --> 18:21.726
but it's worth
taking a look, right?

18:24.479 --> 18:26.481
[Roe] So, Sally already
knocked and called.

18:26.523 --> 18:28.108
[Arthur] How do we even know
if he's home or not?

18:28.149 --> 18:29.567
[Roe] We don't,
we're winging it.

18:29.609 --> 18:30.860
Now come on.

18:33.822 --> 18:35.615
So, Matt's got this
combination lock on his door.

18:35.657 --> 18:36.950
Sally says

18:36.991 --> 18:38.284
he has a bunch of expensive
computer equipment,

18:38.326 --> 18:39.619
and keys can be copied,

18:39.661 --> 18:41.037
so this is more secure,

18:41.079 --> 18:43.039
but Sally doesn't even
have the code.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.249
What's he gonna do
after they're married?

18:44.290 --> 18:45.750
Still make her knock?

18:45.792 --> 18:47.752
We have to get in there.

18:47.794 --> 18:48.837
Roe, with or without the code,

18:48.878 --> 18:50.213
it's breaking and entering.

18:50.255 --> 18:52.173
Let me call in
a wellness check,

18:52.215 --> 18:53.758
get permission
to call a locksmith--

18:53.800 --> 18:56.302
Arthur, what if Matt's in there
and needs medical attention?

18:56.344 --> 18:58.138
Come on! Kick it in.

18:58.179 --> 18:59.222
Breaking and entering
is a crime.

18:59.264 --> 19:00.932
I could get suspended.

19:02.934 --> 19:04.310
Okay, fine, turn around.

19:04.352 --> 19:05.353
-You mean--
-Arthur, just--

19:07.105 --> 19:09.482
Turn around, okay?

19:09.524 --> 19:10.775
-I think that this is--
-Shh, shh, shh!

19:10.817 --> 19:11.860
Okay?

19:11.901 --> 19:13.528
No breaking, just entering.

19:27.292 --> 19:30.670
[***]

19:38.303 --> 19:41.723
[***]

19:51.441 --> 19:52.359
Oh, my--

19:52.400 --> 19:53.693
[glass breaking inside]

19:53.735 --> 19:54.611
Roe!
[banging on door]

19:54.652 --> 19:55.570
Roe!

20:00.408 --> 20:01.493
Okay, a little breaking.

20:01.534 --> 20:02.410
[exhaling]

20:02.452 --> 20:03.578
Come in.

20:03.620 --> 20:05.413
Don't be worried about it,
come on!

20:05.455 --> 20:06.456
Yeah.

20:10.085 --> 20:12.629
[Roe] There are no signs of Matt
in the bedrooms or bathrooms.

20:19.177 --> 20:21.137
Wow, look at this set-up.

20:21.179 --> 20:23.682
Must take a lot
to run a web platform.

20:23.723 --> 20:25.141
Matt left his phone.

20:25.183 --> 20:26.393
No phone, no car?

20:26.434 --> 20:27.394
That can't be good.

20:27.435 --> 20:28.478
Maybe there's a text

20:28.520 --> 20:30.105
and it'll tell us
where he is.

20:30.146 --> 20:31.564
What is that?

20:31.606 --> 20:32.941
Ceramic?

20:32.982 --> 20:34.275
A piece of a mug?

20:37.696 --> 20:39.280
Arthur, look.

20:39.322 --> 20:40.615
Looks like blood.

20:42.617 --> 20:43.993
[Arthur]
It definitely could be...

20:44.035 --> 20:45.328
There...

20:45.370 --> 20:47.497
more drops...

20:51.960 --> 20:54.004
...leading to the balcony.

20:59.300 --> 21:00.635
[Roe]
I didn't notice this before.

21:37.005 --> 21:39.382
We found him.

21:39.424 --> 21:40.925
We found Matt.

21:46.598 --> 21:47.432
[***]

21:53.271 --> 21:54.856
If Matt had too much to drink,

21:54.898 --> 21:58.401
maybe he got dizzy,
fell off the balcony?

21:58.443 --> 22:00.236
Not if those drops
on the floor of his condo

22:00.278 --> 22:02.072
were blood.

22:02.113 --> 22:03.198
Okay, let's turn him over.

22:06.951 --> 22:08.745
It's not Matt.

22:08.787 --> 22:10.288
[Arthur] Not Matt,
but he looks familiar.

22:11.998 --> 22:13.583
That's the guy
that confronted Matt last night

22:13.625 --> 22:14.584
at the party.

22:14.626 --> 22:15.835
Did you get a name?

22:15.877 --> 22:17.337
No. Matt said
he had no idea who he was.

22:18.546 --> 22:20.840
Let's hope Mr. Mysterious
has some ID on him.

22:20.882 --> 22:22.926
Smith, why don't you take
Miss Teagarden

22:22.967 --> 22:23.968
off my crime scene?

22:24.010 --> 22:25.011
Yes, Detective Cook.

22:25.053 --> 22:26.304
Let's go, Roe.

22:41.569 --> 22:42.946
Hey. It's not Matt.

22:42.987 --> 22:45.365
[Sally] Oh, thank god!

22:45.407 --> 22:47.409
Wait, so there was a body
under Matt's balcony,

22:47.450 --> 22:48.410
but it wasn't Matt?

22:48.451 --> 22:50.453
No.

22:50.495 --> 22:51.955
Then who was it?

22:51.996 --> 22:53.123
It was the guy who crashed
your party last night,

22:53.164 --> 22:55.083
the one who was yelling at Matt.

22:55.125 --> 22:56.126
You know who he is?

22:56.167 --> 22:57.252
No.

22:57.293 --> 23:00.255
Wait, so do we know
where Matt is?

23:04.092 --> 23:07.262
Um, sorry, I'll be right back.

23:12.142 --> 23:14.853
Hey, you're Dawn?

23:14.894 --> 23:16.813
You're Dawn Palmer, right?

23:16.855 --> 23:18.398
You've been following Matt.

23:18.440 --> 23:19.357
Did you follow him home
from the party last night?

23:19.399 --> 23:20.567
Yes.

23:20.608 --> 23:21.943
I knew he'd want to see me,

23:21.985 --> 23:24.029
and I was right.

23:24.070 --> 23:26.239
He said that he was glad
to finally talk to me.

23:26.281 --> 23:28.199
Well, did he mention
anything else?

23:28.241 --> 23:30.160
Did he say he had plans
to go somewhere, or--?

23:30.201 --> 23:32.912
My conversations with Matt
are none of your business.

23:32.954 --> 23:33.872
Dawn, look, I just need
a couple of answer--

23:33.913 --> 23:35.498
Dawn!

23:35.540 --> 23:37.500
Dawn, the police are going
to want to talk to you!

23:37.542 --> 23:39.753
Dawn!

23:39.794 --> 23:41.379
[groans]

23:44.924 --> 23:46.593
Do you have any updates?

23:46.634 --> 23:48.011
So that was Dawn Palmer,

23:48.053 --> 23:49.512
Matt's stalker?

23:49.554 --> 23:50.889
She said she spoke to Matt
last night.

23:50.930 --> 23:51.723
That was Dawn?

23:52.932 --> 23:53.892
So he spoke to her last night?

23:53.933 --> 23:55.185
What did he say?

23:55.226 --> 23:56.811
She wouldn't tell me.

23:56.853 --> 23:57.854
She doesn't like
to stick around.

23:57.896 --> 23:58.897
[Arthur] We'll track her down,

23:58.938 --> 24:00.190
but right now,

24:00.231 --> 24:01.066
we have a name
to go with the body.

24:01.107 --> 24:02.484
His driver's license says

24:02.525 --> 24:05.195
he's Brody Kresser
from Walnut Creek, California.

24:05.236 --> 24:06.196
That name ring a bell
with any of you?

24:06.237 --> 24:07.364
No.

24:07.405 --> 24:10.325
And Matt claimed
not to know him?

24:10.367 --> 24:12.786
What do you mean claimed?

24:12.827 --> 24:14.204
If Matt said
that he didn't know him,

24:14.245 --> 24:16.122
then he didn't know him, okay?

24:21.002 --> 24:22.837
Maybe you should give her
a ride home,

24:22.879 --> 24:23.922
let her catch her breath.

24:23.963 --> 24:25.465
Well, could you?

24:25.507 --> 24:26.341
Yeah, no, I--

24:26.383 --> 24:27.425
Yeah, Kara can take her home.

24:27.467 --> 24:28.718
I mean, I'd like to
stick around

24:28.760 --> 24:29.844
and see what else you find--

24:29.886 --> 24:31.471
Kara needs to answer
a few questions

24:31.513 --> 24:33.682
from Detective Cook
regarding her brother.

24:33.723 --> 24:34.849
Basic background information.

24:34.891 --> 24:36.351
-Okay?
-Okay.

24:39.896 --> 24:41.314
[sighs]

24:41.356 --> 24:44.943
Well, I can tell you this...

24:44.984 --> 24:47.153
The medical examiner
just found a huge gash

24:47.195 --> 24:49.489
on the side
of Brody Kresser's head...

24:49.531 --> 24:50.907
Well, if he fell off
that balcony--

24:50.949 --> 24:53.576
...with a shard
of ceramic in it.

24:53.618 --> 24:55.620
Ceramic like the one
we found inside Matt's condo?

24:55.662 --> 24:57.288
Yeah.

24:57.330 --> 24:59.916
It's not looking like
an accidental fall.

24:59.958 --> 25:01.793
It's looking like a homicide.

25:01.835 --> 25:04.254
So the blood
inside the condo...

25:04.295 --> 25:06.089
Matt could be the one
who killed him.

25:06.131 --> 25:08.049
It would explain
why he's missing.

25:08.091 --> 25:09.342
He's on the run.

25:09.384 --> 25:10.927
[exhales]

25:10.969 --> 25:12.303
Someone has to break it
to Sally,

25:12.345 --> 25:14.097
and I think it'd be better
coming from you

25:14.139 --> 25:16.224
than Detective Cook.

25:18.810 --> 25:21.688
[exhales] Yeah, all right.

25:21.730 --> 25:22.522
Wish me luck.

25:24.357 --> 25:25.483
Oh...

25:30.321 --> 25:31.865
[Roe] Sally, you're not
listening to me.

25:31.906 --> 25:33.199
This is serious.

25:33.241 --> 25:34.200
It's something
you need to be prepared for.

25:34.242 --> 25:35.535
Right, but I think

25:35.577 --> 25:37.037
that you might be
overreacting a little bit.

25:37.078 --> 25:38.121
-Aida?
-What?

25:38.163 --> 25:39.414
Will you please tell Roe

25:39.456 --> 25:42.542
that studying true crime
is warping her mind?

25:42.584 --> 25:44.127
She thinks
that we can't find Matt

25:44.169 --> 25:45.920
because he's involved
in killing someone.

25:45.962 --> 25:47.297
It's a possibility,

25:47.339 --> 25:49.007
one of many
the police are considering.

25:49.049 --> 25:50.091
But it's absurd.

25:50.133 --> 25:52.135
Roe, my Matt?

25:52.177 --> 25:55.180
He volunteers
at an animal shelter.

25:56.639 --> 25:59.267
It is crazy to think
that he could kill someone.

26:03.188 --> 26:05.523
I have to go call my parents.

26:08.360 --> 26:10.820
What in the world is going on?

26:10.862 --> 26:12.447
It's been a long day.

26:12.489 --> 26:14.407
Let's make some tea,
and I'll fill you in.

26:14.449 --> 26:15.909
Please.

26:24.459 --> 26:25.710
Carson.

26:25.752 --> 26:28.004
Just the person
we've been wanting to talk to.

26:28.046 --> 26:30.173
Hey, what-what's going on?

26:30.215 --> 26:31.383
You know
Matt's missing, right?

26:31.424 --> 26:32.592
What?

26:32.634 --> 26:34.803
Well, I know he didn't show up
at the shop

26:34.844 --> 26:36.179
to pick up the tuxedos
that he was supposed to

26:36.221 --> 26:37.347
this morning.

26:37.389 --> 26:39.683
No. You're telling me
he's missing?

26:39.724 --> 26:41.226
Neither Sally nor his sister
have heard from him

26:41.267 --> 26:42.018
since last night.

26:42.060 --> 26:43.436
Oh.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.813
Do you have any idea
where he is?

26:44.854 --> 26:46.022
Wh-- No.

26:46.064 --> 26:47.357
No...

26:48.733 --> 26:50.610
Is that why all the patrol cars
are out front?

26:50.652 --> 26:51.736
No, those are here

26:51.778 --> 26:53.697
because we found a body
on the premises.

26:53.738 --> 26:55.407
A body?

26:55.448 --> 26:56.616
Oh...

26:56.658 --> 26:57.826
but it's not Matt.

26:57.867 --> 26:58.702
It's the guy he had
that altercation with

26:58.743 --> 26:59.828
last night.

26:59.869 --> 27:01.329
A guy named Brody Kresser.

27:01.371 --> 27:02.747
Did you know him?

27:02.789 --> 27:03.832
No.

27:03.873 --> 27:05.417
No, I'm sure that was...

27:05.458 --> 27:06.543
I've never seen him
before last night.

27:06.584 --> 27:07.836
No, that's crazy.
That's awful.

27:07.877 --> 27:10.588
So if the body isn't Matt,

27:10.630 --> 27:13.216
um, why are you guys
searching his place?

27:13.258 --> 27:14.259
Shouldn't you be out
looking for him?

27:14.300 --> 27:15.677
Well, we're hoping
to find something

27:15.719 --> 27:17.971
that might tell us where
he's disappeared to, for one.

27:18.013 --> 27:19.472
Right.

27:19.514 --> 27:21.641
You really
have no ideas on that?

27:22.892 --> 27:24.394
No.
No, zero ideas.

27:24.436 --> 27:26.396
I wish I could help, you know.

27:26.438 --> 27:28.982
Um, you know,
the computers in there,

27:29.024 --> 27:29.941
they don't belong to Matt,

27:29.983 --> 27:31.860
they belong to our company.

27:31.901 --> 27:33.153
If it's okay with you,

27:33.194 --> 27:35.321
I'd like to pack them up
and take them with me.

27:35.363 --> 27:36.781
Yeah, that's--
that's not going to happen.

27:36.823 --> 27:38.700
Right, I understand,

27:38.742 --> 27:42.037
but if you are thinking
of taking them,

27:42.078 --> 27:43.538
I expect to see a warrant

27:43.580 --> 27:46.082
specific to Giggoblog property,
of course.

27:46.124 --> 27:46.958
Well, I don't think
Detective Cook

27:47.000 --> 27:48.209
was considering that before,

27:48.251 --> 27:50.587
but, uh,
I'm guessing he will now.

27:50.628 --> 27:52.088
Right...

27:52.130 --> 27:53.381
Right.

27:55.008 --> 27:57.927
Well, um, I'll leave you be,

27:57.969 --> 27:59.137
and keep me posted.

27:59.179 --> 28:01.014
You bet.

28:01.056 --> 28:03.391
See you.

28:14.152 --> 28:15.987
Hmm...

28:16.029 --> 28:18.573
So it appears Brody Kresser's
only address his entire life

28:18.615 --> 28:21.826
was his parents' house
in Walnut Creek, California.

28:21.868 --> 28:24.245
Although it's probably
his house now.

28:24.287 --> 28:25.955
There's an obituary here
for his mother, Alice,

28:25.997 --> 28:26.956
from three years ago.

28:26.998 --> 28:28.875
She died just one month

28:28.917 --> 28:30.585
after her husband was killed
in a car accident.

28:30.627 --> 28:31.795
Oh, my gosh,

28:31.836 --> 28:33.296
how tragic to lose
both of your parents

28:33.338 --> 28:34.964
so close together.

28:35.006 --> 28:37.133
Aurora, please promise me

28:37.175 --> 28:38.176
you'll always
take care of yourself,

28:38.218 --> 28:39.761
and you will stay
out of trouble.

28:39.803 --> 28:41.346
Mother, do not worry.

28:41.388 --> 28:43.264
I do not plan on making a habit
out of this sort of thing.

28:43.306 --> 28:44.182
That's good.

28:46.351 --> 28:47.560
[Sally sighs]

28:47.602 --> 28:49.854
Okay, so my parents want me
to stay with them

28:49.896 --> 28:51.648
until Matt shows up.

28:51.690 --> 28:53.024
They promised they'd help me

28:53.066 --> 28:54.484
finish setting everything up
for the wedding.

28:54.526 --> 28:57.112
The wedding?

28:57.153 --> 28:58.780
Sally, how are you going
to have a wedding

28:58.822 --> 29:00.031
without a groom?

29:00.073 --> 29:01.074
You heard what Arthur said?

29:01.116 --> 29:02.867
Missing grooms always show up.

29:02.909 --> 29:05.161
I'm sure that Matt

29:05.203 --> 29:06.204
is going to come
bursting through the door

29:06.246 --> 29:07.163
any second,

29:07.205 --> 29:08.915
and explain
everything to you.

29:08.957 --> 29:10.625
Of course he will.

29:12.377 --> 29:13.378
Mm-hmm.

29:14.963 --> 29:17.298
All right, well, you call me
if you need anything.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.591
What if what I need

29:18.633 --> 29:20.802
is for you to believe
that Matt will show up?

29:20.844 --> 29:22.178
I'm so sorry
this is happening.

29:22.220 --> 29:23.054
Oh.

29:25.265 --> 29:26.349
Carson!

29:26.391 --> 29:28.101
You've heard from Matt?

29:28.143 --> 29:29.853
No.

29:29.894 --> 29:31.604
No, I'm here to find out
if you have.

29:33.023 --> 29:34.983
No, we still don't know
where he is.

29:35.025 --> 29:36.901
I mean, you're his fiancée.

29:36.943 --> 29:38.862
Surely, you must have some idea
where he went,

29:38.903 --> 29:40.822
some special place
he likes to go.

29:40.864 --> 29:41.823
Don't you think
we'd have looked there

29:41.865 --> 29:42.866
if she knew?

29:42.907 --> 29:43.950
I'm sorry, you're right.

29:43.992 --> 29:46.286
I'm just worried
out of my mind.

29:48.038 --> 29:49.497
[car horn honks]

29:49.539 --> 29:50.957
That's my dad.
I gotta go.

29:50.999 --> 29:52.083
Okay.
Keep me posted?

29:52.125 --> 29:53.585
Yeah.

29:53.626 --> 29:55.503
-Bye.
-Bye.

29:56.755 --> 29:58.381
Sorry to bother.

29:58.423 --> 30:00.008
Hey, Carson,

30:00.050 --> 30:01.968
if you don't mind me asking,

30:02.010 --> 30:05.013
how did you and Matt meet?

30:05.055 --> 30:07.557
We were in the same
web-coding class in college.

30:07.599 --> 30:09.059
He was way better than me,

30:09.100 --> 30:10.894
so I glommed onto him
when it came to team projects.

30:10.935 --> 30:12.645
That's where he told me
about the idea

30:12.687 --> 30:13.897
for a blogging platform,

30:13.938 --> 30:15.398
and a business dream was born.

30:16.524 --> 30:17.734
So why do you think

30:17.776 --> 30:19.486
Brody Kresser confronted him
like that?

30:19.527 --> 30:21.738
I mean, was it, like,
some kind of rivalry?

30:21.780 --> 30:22.989
Did they know each other--

30:23.031 --> 30:24.407
You know what, I already had
your cop friend

30:24.449 --> 30:25.700
grill me about this.

30:25.742 --> 30:27.285
I don't know
what you're getting at,

30:27.327 --> 30:29.245
but I never heard of the guy.

30:29.287 --> 30:32.957
If he knew Matt, it wasn't
through Giggoblog, okay?

30:33.708 --> 30:34.584
Okay.

30:34.626 --> 30:37.045
I'll see you.

30:39.839 --> 30:42.550
[***]

30:55.563 --> 30:58.274
Roe Teagarden,
what are you still doing here?

30:58.316 --> 31:00.318
Well, I was hoping to do
some research, but...

31:00.360 --> 31:03.029
Researching your thesis topic?

31:03.071 --> 31:06.157
My friend's fiancé, Matt,
went missing,

31:06.199 --> 31:08.952
and while we were
looking for him,

31:08.993 --> 31:10.745
we found a body
under his balcony.

31:10.787 --> 31:13.623
Wait, you found a body?

31:13.665 --> 31:14.958
A dead body?

31:15.000 --> 31:16.751
The police think it's murder,

31:16.793 --> 31:17.711
and I'm afraid
Matt may have killed him

31:17.752 --> 31:18.837
and taken off,

31:18.878 --> 31:20.964
and that's why
no one can find him.

31:21.006 --> 31:23.967
So, what exactly
had you planned to research?

31:24.009 --> 31:27.053
Well, I thought I'd start
with the victim,

31:27.095 --> 31:29.723
maybe look into
Matt's company, or...

31:29.764 --> 31:32.183
Honestly, I'm not really sure.

31:32.225 --> 31:33.685
You're in your second year

31:33.727 --> 31:35.145
of library
and information science,

31:35.186 --> 31:37.939
and you're still
not sure where to start?

31:37.981 --> 31:41.192
Okay, let's...
let's try this.

31:41.234 --> 31:42.694
Um...

31:42.736 --> 31:46.031
what is the seventh principle
of Information Science?

31:46.072 --> 31:47.991
Information can be converted
to knowledge

31:48.033 --> 31:49.617
through
the "knowledge instinct".

31:49.659 --> 31:52.537
So then, where did
your instinct tell you to begin?

31:52.579 --> 31:54.039
With the victim.

31:54.080 --> 31:56.332
I thought I should learn
everything I could about him.

31:56.374 --> 31:59.210
Did you know that
these computers are connected

31:59.252 --> 32:02.297
to all the university databases?

32:07.844 --> 32:10.013
Okay, so,

32:10.055 --> 32:11.681
now you need
a plan of attack.

32:11.723 --> 32:14.184
Tell me the eighth principle
of information science.

32:14.225 --> 32:17.562
That's the one
on knowledge ecologies, right?

32:18.772 --> 32:20.023
No information stands alone.

32:20.065 --> 32:21.483
All information is produced

32:21.524 --> 32:24.652
within the context
of social relationships, so...

32:24.694 --> 32:25.987
I could start

32:26.029 --> 32:26.738
with Brody Kresser's
family and friends.

32:28.239 --> 32:31.409
Thank you for your help.

32:36.039 --> 32:38.041
We still haven't located
any family for Kresser.

32:38.083 --> 32:39.459
His parents are dead,
no siblings.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.211
I'm working on tracking down
an aunt in New England.

32:41.252 --> 32:42.796
What about work history?

32:42.837 --> 32:44.089
Coming up empty on that, too.

32:44.130 --> 32:45.632
He's never been employed
that I can tell.

32:45.674 --> 32:47.425
Although his parents
seemed pretty well-to-do.

32:47.467 --> 32:49.594
He inherited their house
in Walnut Creek.

32:51.429 --> 32:52.305
Sorry.

32:52.347 --> 32:54.182
So what's he doing up here?

32:54.224 --> 32:56.643
Looking for Matt Walker,
apparently.

32:56.685 --> 32:58.645
Well, the preliminary search
on Walker's condo

32:58.687 --> 32:59.771
came up with nothing.

32:59.813 --> 33:00.939
Nothing
on his cell phone either,

33:00.980 --> 33:02.357
no mysterious calls or texts.

33:02.399 --> 33:04.192
However, the ceramic shard

33:04.234 --> 33:05.485
they found
under the coffee table

33:05.527 --> 33:08.071
is a match to the shard
we found

33:08.113 --> 33:09.531
in the wound
in Kresser's head,

33:09.572 --> 33:11.991
but there's nothing else
matching it in the condo.

33:12.033 --> 33:13.743
So the killer
picked up the pieces?

33:13.785 --> 33:15.412
Yeah...

33:15.453 --> 33:17.747
and hopefully threw them
in a dumpster nearby.

33:19.165 --> 33:21.001
It's too bad the condo
association was too cheap

33:21.042 --> 33:22.627
to spring for security cameras.

33:22.669 --> 33:24.462
And how long

33:24.504 --> 33:26.047
before we get DNA blood results
from the condo?

33:26.089 --> 33:27.674
About 10 days,

33:27.716 --> 33:29.467
but I think it's pretty clear
what happened.

33:29.509 --> 33:31.636
Matt Walker lied
about knowing Kresser.

33:31.678 --> 33:33.096
After the altercation
at the party,

33:33.138 --> 33:34.431
Kresser shows up at his place,

33:34.472 --> 33:35.765
they get into another fight,

33:35.807 --> 33:37.017
Walker kills him,

33:37.058 --> 33:38.309
and in a panic,
throws him off the balcony,

33:38.351 --> 33:40.437
then makes himself scarce.

33:40.478 --> 33:42.355
Um, but don't we need
to establish motive first?

33:43.898 --> 33:46.109
Thank you, Smith,
I almost forgot.

33:46.151 --> 33:48.111
After we get
another warrant signed,

33:48.153 --> 33:49.404
we'll bring in
Walker's computers.

33:49.446 --> 33:51.031
I'm sure we'll find
the why there.

33:51.072 --> 33:52.282
I'm not worried,
the evidence is solid.

33:52.323 --> 33:53.992
What we really need to do

33:54.034 --> 33:56.119
is talk to the woman
who was stalking Walker,

33:56.161 --> 33:57.996
the one who said she saw him

33:58.038 --> 33:59.456
standing at his place
last night.

33:59.497 --> 34:00.623
Dawn Palmer.

34:00.665 --> 34:01.791
Yeah.

34:01.833 --> 34:03.960
She's a possible
material witness.

34:04.002 --> 34:06.296
Find her, bring her to me,

34:06.338 --> 34:07.505
and clean up your desk.

34:18.475 --> 34:20.352
[clicking]

34:24.981 --> 34:27.525
No way.

34:27.567 --> 34:29.402
Find something?

34:29.444 --> 34:31.154
An archived
social-media account

34:31.196 --> 34:33.281
belonging to Alice Kresser,

34:33.323 --> 34:34.366
Brody's mother.

34:36.368 --> 34:38.661
Turns out Matt was lying
about not knowing Brody.

34:40.538 --> 34:42.957
I just found
a photo of them together.

35:00.809 --> 35:03.019
So Matt knew the dead guy.

35:03.061 --> 35:05.355
And his parents.

35:05.397 --> 35:06.648
This was posted five years ago.

35:06.690 --> 35:07.857
The caption said

35:07.899 --> 35:10.443
it was Brody's father's
birthday party.

35:10.485 --> 35:12.612
Look, I'm really sorry,

35:12.654 --> 35:15.448
but I have to give this
to the police.

35:15.490 --> 35:17.617
No. Please, you can't do that.

35:17.659 --> 35:18.910
Please, you can't.

35:18.952 --> 35:20.120
They might think that Matt

35:20.161 --> 35:21.621
had something to do
with this guy's death,

35:21.663 --> 35:22.956
and he did not.

35:22.997 --> 35:24.124
There's absolutely no world

35:24.165 --> 35:26.376
in which Matt
would hurt anybody ever.

35:26.418 --> 35:27.711
I hope that's true,

35:27.752 --> 35:29.838
for your sake, for Sally's sake.

35:32.882 --> 35:34.718
Ever since I saw Dawn
yesterday,

35:34.759 --> 35:36.177
I've had this terrible feeling

35:36.219 --> 35:37.971
that maybe she was so upset
about Matt marrying Sally

35:38.013 --> 35:39.347
that she did something to him.

35:39.389 --> 35:41.182
Like, if she can't have him,
then nobody can,

35:41.224 --> 35:43.560
and this Brody guy
got in the way, or...

35:43.601 --> 35:44.978
Hi.

35:46.271 --> 35:47.647
He's here for the photo,

35:47.689 --> 35:51.192
but you should tell him
what you told me about Dawn.

35:51.234 --> 35:52.485
If you're talking about
Dawn Palmer,

35:52.527 --> 35:54.446
we have an APB out on her
right now,

35:54.487 --> 35:57.115
but until then...

36:01.202 --> 36:02.787
...this is not a good look
for your brother.

36:10.754 --> 36:11.963
I've always loved
the tradition

36:12.005 --> 36:13.214
of giving out wedding favors,

36:13.256 --> 36:15.592
you know, so your guests
have a memento

36:15.633 --> 36:17.260
of your special day.

36:17.302 --> 36:21.014
Well, I'm glad your divorce
didn't sour you on marriage.

36:21.056 --> 36:23.141
Oh, no, quite the contrary.

36:23.183 --> 36:26.311
I'm a bigger proponent
than ever.

36:26.353 --> 36:27.604
I took for granted

36:27.645 --> 36:28.980
how much marriage grounds you,
you know.

36:29.022 --> 36:31.775
Everything seems
so much more precarious

36:31.816 --> 36:33.360
when you go it alone.

36:33.401 --> 36:34.277
Do you miss Charles?

36:36.112 --> 36:38.823
Every day,

36:38.865 --> 36:42.869
but he and I made
the logical decision for us,

36:42.911 --> 36:45.580
and so I see no reason
to be maudlin about it.

36:45.622 --> 36:47.290
[door opens and closes]

36:47.332 --> 36:48.958
-[Roe] Hey.
-Hey.

36:55.215 --> 36:56.925
Whatever
Sally needs help with,

36:56.966 --> 36:58.426
I'm willing to help her.

37:00.303 --> 37:01.805
[Sally] I want to be ready
for the wedding.

37:01.846 --> 37:03.098
The rehearsal dinner is tonight,

37:03.139 --> 37:05.392
and I know Matt will be there.

37:05.433 --> 37:07.060
I don't want him to think
I lost faith in him,

37:07.102 --> 37:09.229
'cause I know that he would
never lose faith in me.

37:10.814 --> 37:12.273
Um, Sally?

37:12.315 --> 37:13.900
Hmm?

37:20.532 --> 37:22.200
There's something
you need to see.

37:26.705 --> 37:29.040
Turns out
Matt did know the victim.

37:34.045 --> 37:35.797
This will all make sense

37:35.839 --> 37:38.383
when he comes back
and explains himself.

37:38.425 --> 37:40.552
You'll see.

37:40.593 --> 37:44.222
If you don't mind,
I have to take these to the car.

37:51.312 --> 37:54.899
[slow hold music playing
over phone]

37:57.861 --> 37:58.987
[Detective Cook clearing throat]

38:02.741 --> 38:06.202
Uh... what is it?

38:06.244 --> 38:07.746
The medical examiner
just gave me a preview

38:07.787 --> 38:09.873
of Kresser's autopsy results.

38:09.914 --> 38:10.749
He's narrowed down
the time of death

38:10.790 --> 38:11.916
between 10:00 PM and midnight

38:11.958 --> 38:13.043
the night of the party.

38:13.084 --> 38:15.420
Pretty much
what we figured, right?

38:15.462 --> 38:16.838
Right.

38:16.880 --> 38:17.881
He also said the gash
on the victim's head

38:17.922 --> 38:19.299
was not fatal.

38:19.341 --> 38:21.134
Broke the skin,
but not the skull.

38:21.176 --> 38:22.802
The cause of death
was internal bleeding

38:22.844 --> 38:24.346
from injuries sustained
during the fall.

38:24.387 --> 38:27.682
So, this might not be
a homicide after all,

38:27.724 --> 38:29.726
not if Kresser fell on his own.

38:29.768 --> 38:31.603
Maybe he was pushed.

38:31.644 --> 38:33.938
Yeah, maybe.

38:33.980 --> 38:36.941
On the bright side,
we did find Ms. Palmer.

38:36.983 --> 38:39.235
She was at the Cedarbridge Inn,

38:39.277 --> 38:41.446
parked in the lot
right next to Matt Walker's car,

38:41.488 --> 38:45.575
which had been there
since the other night.

38:45.617 --> 38:48.078
Let's see what she has to say.

38:49.954 --> 38:51.039
You were seen outside
Matt Walker's condo

38:51.081 --> 38:52.499
the other night.

38:52.540 --> 38:53.958
-We've been looking for--
-I don't know what you mean.

38:54.000 --> 38:55.168
We have a witness who--

38:58.505 --> 39:01.841
We have a witness
who said she spoke to you,

39:01.883 --> 39:03.301
and you told her
you followed Matt home

39:03.343 --> 39:04.844
from his wedding kick-off party.

39:04.886 --> 39:05.762
Well, she was lying.

39:05.804 --> 39:07.430
I wasn't there.

39:07.472 --> 39:08.431
[Detective Cook] Miss Palmer,
you're the one that's lying,

39:08.473 --> 39:09.933
and I'd like to know why.

39:09.974 --> 39:11.101
Because
it's none of your business

39:11.142 --> 39:13.645
if I saw Matt or didn't see him.

39:13.687 --> 39:16.773
I would never reveal anything
that he told me in confidence,

39:16.815 --> 39:19.150
not to you, not to anyone.

39:19.192 --> 39:20.276
[Cook] This is not a game.

39:20.318 --> 39:22.112
This is a murder investigation,

39:22.153 --> 39:23.238
and if you're
withholding information--

39:23.279 --> 39:24.698
I'll never betray Matt.

39:24.739 --> 39:26.491
Never.

39:29.869 --> 39:31.955
Well, then, Miss Palmer,

39:31.996 --> 39:33.415
you can just sit here

39:33.456 --> 39:35.375
and think about
what it's going to feel like

39:35.417 --> 39:38.503
when we charge you
with accessory to murder.

39:40.463 --> 39:42.132
[chair banging]

39:48.013 --> 39:49.889
I'm thirsty.

39:49.931 --> 39:52.142
You have a soda machine
around here?

39:53.268 --> 39:54.144
Really?

39:56.021 --> 39:57.272
You know, I am impressed

39:57.313 --> 39:59.149
that you haven't
given up on your search.

39:59.190 --> 40:00.859
You know, 'cause
information science prescribes

40:00.900 --> 40:02.110
that you stay on the same track

40:02.152 --> 40:03.862
until you're sure
you've exhausted it,

40:03.903 --> 40:05.030
which...

40:05.071 --> 40:06.322
can be exhausting.

40:06.364 --> 40:07.907
Well,

40:07.949 --> 40:09.367
I went into
the court-system database

40:09.409 --> 40:10.785
for Walnut Creek,

40:10.827 --> 40:13.580
and look, Brody Kresser's
parents filed for bankruptcy

40:13.621 --> 40:15.665
just weeks before
Brody's father's car crash.

40:15.707 --> 40:17.125
That's an intriguing find.

40:17.167 --> 40:18.626
A strange find,

40:18.668 --> 40:20.587
because I also found
an archived social media post

40:20.628 --> 40:22.005
from Brody Kresser's mother

40:22.047 --> 40:23.006
where she talks about
her husband

40:23.048 --> 40:24.549
quitting a Silicon Valley job

40:24.591 --> 40:25.675
for, quote, a new venture.

40:26.885 --> 40:28.303
Here, I'll show you.

40:32.682 --> 40:34.017
I-I don't understand.

40:34.059 --> 40:36.186
Her account is gone.

40:36.227 --> 40:37.228
It was here, like,
20 minutes ago.

40:37.270 --> 40:39.064
How could it be deleted?

40:39.105 --> 40:40.523
Um, well, someone
with override access

40:40.565 --> 40:41.608
in the archive?

40:41.649 --> 40:43.360
I do know someone

40:43.401 --> 40:45.695
who can supposedly do anything
on the Internet.

40:56.581 --> 40:58.667
[groans] I knew it.

40:59.918 --> 41:01.878
"Matt, I gave him the cash,

41:01.920 --> 41:04.839
and he swears
he won't ask for more."

41:09.969 --> 41:10.887
What?

41:10.929 --> 41:11.846
[yelps] Oh!

41:14.599 --> 41:15.517
[stamping]

41:15.558 --> 41:18.353
[man grunts]

41:20.897 --> 41:21.815
Aurora?

41:21.856 --> 41:23.191
Matt?

41:27.737 --> 41:30.365
I'm sorry. I...

41:30.407 --> 41:32.784
I thought you were Dawn, okay?

41:32.826 --> 41:33.827
She's the only one
I thought would be crazy enough

41:33.868 --> 41:35.620
to break in here.

41:35.662 --> 41:36.788
What is wrong with you?

41:36.830 --> 41:37.914
Do you know how worried
Sally's been?

41:37.956 --> 41:40.291
I didn't mean to worry her.

41:40.333 --> 41:43.545
I just had some things
I had to take care of,

41:43.586 --> 41:45.463
and I didn't have my phone.

41:45.505 --> 41:47.048
I'm guessing
you left it behind

41:47.090 --> 41:48.717
so the police couldn't use
cell phone towers to ping you

41:48.758 --> 41:51.386
and track you down.

41:51.428 --> 41:53.805
What are you talking about?

41:53.847 --> 41:54.639
Are you calling Sally?

41:54.681 --> 41:56.391
Shh! Hey!

41:56.433 --> 41:57.559
Arthur?

41:57.600 --> 41:59.227
Yeah, I, um, I found Matt.

41:59.269 --> 42:01.021
Mm-hmm.

42:01.062 --> 42:02.689
Yeah, I'm at his condo.

42:02.731 --> 42:04.190
Okay.

42:04.232 --> 42:05.942
Okay, thanks.

42:05.984 --> 42:07.902
I'm supposed to inform you

42:07.944 --> 42:09.070
that you need to wait here

42:09.112 --> 42:10.363
for Detective Cook and Arthur
to arrive.

42:11.740 --> 42:14.034
Why would I leave?

42:14.075 --> 42:14.993
I get married tomorrow.

42:15.035 --> 42:16.786
Really?

42:16.828 --> 42:18.580
That's why you came back?

42:18.621 --> 42:19.706
For your wedding?

42:19.748 --> 42:21.082
Yes.

42:21.124 --> 42:22.417
Not to get to your computer

42:22.459 --> 42:24.961
and delete that email
I just saw on your screen?

42:25.003 --> 42:26.921
Matt, I found a photo
of you and Brody together

42:26.963 --> 42:28.256
at his father's birthday party.

42:28.298 --> 42:31.134
I gave a copy to the police,
and I showed Sally.

42:31.176 --> 42:31.843
You showed Sally?

42:31.885 --> 42:33.762
Of course I did.

42:33.803 --> 42:35.930
Now I'm calling Sally.

42:35.972 --> 42:38.183
She deserves to know
where you've been.

42:39.517 --> 42:40.393
Your sister, too.

42:42.896 --> 42:44.647
[Arthur] You jumped
the balcony again?

42:44.689 --> 42:46.900
Yeah, and when I got in there,

42:46.941 --> 42:48.777
Matt was deleting stuff
off his computer.

42:48.818 --> 42:49.611
How'd you even get in there?

42:49.652 --> 42:50.779
I read a manual

42:50.820 --> 42:52.197
on how to pick a lock
this morning.

42:52.238 --> 42:53.323
Of course.

42:56.034 --> 42:57.577
Sorry.

42:57.619 --> 42:58.870
Aurora.

42:58.912 --> 42:59.788
Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

42:59.829 --> 43:01.623
Where is he?
Where's...

43:01.664 --> 43:03.583
Oh, thank goodness, you're okay.

43:03.625 --> 43:05.210
I'm sorry, Sally.

43:07.253 --> 43:08.505
Are you guys arresting him?

43:08.546 --> 43:10.256
We're just taking him in
to answer some questions.

43:10.298 --> 43:13.343
Roe, if you get any more ideas
about this case,

43:13.385 --> 43:15.220
call me first.

43:21.267 --> 43:23.687
They're just going
to question him, right?

43:23.728 --> 43:25.105
Um...

43:25.146 --> 43:26.439
yeah.

43:41.830 --> 43:43.039
You're free to go.

43:43.081 --> 43:44.249
Matt!

44:04.227 --> 44:05.145
I had nothing to do with that.

44:07.230 --> 44:08.314
You had an altercation
with this guy

44:08.356 --> 44:09.691
just hours before
this happened to him.

44:09.733 --> 44:11.234
You lied about knowing him.

44:11.276 --> 44:13.194
You disappeared
after his murder,

44:13.236 --> 44:15.447
left your fiancée and friends
and family in the dark.

44:15.488 --> 44:17.198
I think you had
everything to do with this.

44:17.240 --> 44:19.284
Look, I know how bad this looks,
but I...

44:24.914 --> 44:26.499
I don't think I should answer
any more questions

44:26.541 --> 44:27.751
until I've spoken to a lawyer.

44:27.792 --> 44:29.627
If you're not
charging me with anything...

44:29.669 --> 44:30.670
You want to have formal charges?

44:32.422 --> 44:33.465
Fine.

44:33.506 --> 44:35.592
Let's see what the D.A.
has to say.

44:43.141 --> 44:44.684
Sally deserves better.

44:47.437 --> 44:50.690
I know she does...

44:50.732 --> 44:51.524
but I do love her.

44:53.985 --> 44:56.321
Yeah, I understand.

44:57.447 --> 44:59.032
Well?

44:59.074 --> 45:01.868
The D.A. won't support
formal charges against Walker.

45:01.910 --> 45:03.828
Says we don't have enough.

45:03.870 --> 45:04.621
But the victim's blood
is in the condo.

45:04.662 --> 45:05.413
It's solid evidence.

45:05.455 --> 45:06.456
Circumstantial.

45:06.498 --> 45:07.999
The hit on the head
didn't kill him,

45:08.041 --> 45:09.834
the fall off the balcony did.

45:09.876 --> 45:11.336
We have no evidence
that Walker pushed him,

45:11.378 --> 45:13.171
there's no DNA
on Kresser's clothing,

45:13.213 --> 45:15.090
nothing under his fingernails.

45:15.131 --> 45:16.925
We can't even place Walker
at the condo

45:16.966 --> 45:18.259
at the time of death.

45:18.301 --> 45:19.427
We got no security footage,
no taxi receipts.

45:19.469 --> 45:21.262
We got nothing.

45:21.304 --> 45:22.764
Well, if we could get Dawn
to talk to us,

45:22.806 --> 45:23.890
she could place him
at the condo.

45:23.932 --> 45:25.308
Good luck with that.

45:26.393 --> 45:28.770
For now,
we got to cut Walker loose,

45:28.812 --> 45:30.271
but I want you to tail him.

45:30.313 --> 45:31.940
No more disappearing suspects.

45:31.981 --> 45:33.316
You got it.

45:37.570 --> 45:38.822
[Arthur] Like Cook told you,

45:38.863 --> 45:41.324
do not under any circumstances
leave town.

45:45.829 --> 45:47.497
Hi.

45:49.874 --> 45:52.585
[Kara] Welcome back,
little brother.

45:56.548 --> 45:58.967
Uh, it's almost time
for the wedding rehearsal.

45:59.009 --> 46:00.760
We should head
straight to the church.

46:00.802 --> 46:02.178
[Roe] Um, I'm sorry.

46:02.220 --> 46:03.888
You've been gone for days,

46:03.930 --> 46:06.141
we found a body
under your balcony,

46:06.182 --> 46:07.684
and you want to go on
as if nothing has happened?

46:07.726 --> 46:09.144
I had nothing to do
with Brody Kresser's death,

46:09.185 --> 46:11.646
but if you're asking
if I still want to marry Sally,

46:11.688 --> 46:13.648
the answer is yes,

46:13.690 --> 46:15.650
of course I do.

46:15.692 --> 46:18.403
Sally, is that what you want?

46:18.445 --> 46:19.904
For all of us
to go to the rehearsal?

46:19.946 --> 46:21.239
Just-just...

46:21.281 --> 46:23.950
ride to the church
with me, okay?

46:23.992 --> 46:24.701
I'll explain everything.

46:27.537 --> 46:29.456
Roe and Kara have been
helping me keep it together

46:29.497 --> 46:30.540
for two days.

46:30.582 --> 46:32.917
They deserve
an explanation as well.

46:32.959 --> 46:34.044
You're right...

46:34.085 --> 46:36.421
they do...

46:37.672 --> 46:39.257
...but not here.

46:42.177 --> 46:45.847
[Sally] Okay.

46:45.889 --> 46:47.557
[Roe] Why don't we start with
why you lied about knowing Brody

46:47.599 --> 46:48.725
that night at the party?

46:48.767 --> 46:50.143
[Matt] I didn't lie.

46:50.185 --> 46:52.270
I didn't realize it was him
until after he left.

46:52.312 --> 46:54.564
The son of a friend
I was close to once.

46:54.606 --> 46:56.024
John Kresser.

46:56.066 --> 46:57.192
John was a guest speaker

46:57.233 --> 46:59.027
in one of
my computer science classes.

46:59.069 --> 47:01.154
He became sort of
a mentor to me.

47:01.196 --> 47:02.697
I only met Brody once
at a party.

47:02.739 --> 47:04.199
I barely spoke to the guy.

47:04.240 --> 47:08.078
John was the one
I was actually friends with...

47:08.119 --> 47:09.621
until I came up with
the idea for Giggoblog.

47:09.662 --> 47:11.164
He didn't think it was
a very good idea,

47:11.206 --> 47:13.917
gave it
some pretty heavy criticism.

47:13.958 --> 47:15.919
I didn't take it well,

47:15.960 --> 47:17.337
said some things I regret,

47:17.379 --> 47:19.381
and we weren't friends
after that.

47:19.422 --> 47:21.883
Brody was yelling at you
that you owed him.

47:21.925 --> 47:23.259
What did he think you owe him?

47:23.301 --> 47:25.345
[Matt] An apology, I guess.

47:25.387 --> 47:27.722
The apology
I should have gave John.

47:27.764 --> 47:29.391
He, um...

47:29.432 --> 47:31.810
died in that car accident
before I had the chance.

47:31.851 --> 47:33.770
Matt, that's awful.
I'm so sorry.

47:33.812 --> 47:36.064
What happened with Brody
at the party really threw me,

47:36.106 --> 47:38.692
so I took a cab
to a bar downtown.

47:38.733 --> 47:40.068
Dawn Palmer said

47:40.110 --> 47:42.654
she followed you home
to your condo that night.

47:42.696 --> 47:43.863
She said she spoke with you.

47:43.905 --> 47:45.532
Dawn...

47:45.573 --> 47:48.076
Dawn will say anything.
That didn't happen.

47:48.118 --> 47:49.536
I didn't get home
until the middle of the night.

47:49.577 --> 47:50.745
Some guy from the bar
dropped me off.

47:50.787 --> 47:53.415
A guy?
What was his name?

47:53.456 --> 47:54.958
I don't know, Fred something.

47:55.000 --> 47:57.669
Fred Baskin, or Haskins.

47:57.711 --> 47:59.587
When I got home,
I was still in my head,

47:59.629 --> 48:01.214
so I went for a walk.

48:01.256 --> 48:03.800
I ended up at that motel,
the Great 8, near the mall.

48:03.842 --> 48:06.219
I didn't have my phone,
I didn't have my car.

48:06.261 --> 48:08.221
I just sat in that room
thinking.

48:08.263 --> 48:11.474
Thinking about
the Kresser thing,

48:11.516 --> 48:12.642
about us.

48:12.684 --> 48:15.270
Worrying I wasn't
good enough for you.

48:15.311 --> 48:16.813
So you sat in the room
for two days

48:16.855 --> 48:17.647
and never called me?

48:19.607 --> 48:20.734
That first morning,

48:20.775 --> 48:22.694
I turned on the TV,
and I saw the news.

48:22.736 --> 48:24.946
Brody Kresser's body
found outside my building?

48:24.988 --> 48:25.989
I got scared.

48:26.031 --> 48:28.283
I didn't know what to do.

48:28.324 --> 48:29.117
This morning, I shook it off.

48:29.159 --> 48:30.118
I walked home and I--

48:30.160 --> 48:31.703
And used your web skills

48:31.745 --> 48:34.247
to find Alice Kresser's
archived social-media account

48:34.289 --> 48:36.374
and delete it.

48:36.416 --> 48:38.626
Okay, yes,
I deleted some things.

48:38.668 --> 48:41.254
I remembered seeing
that picture of me and Brody,

48:41.296 --> 48:43.131
and I was worried that
it wasn't going to look good,

48:43.173 --> 48:44.090
and guess what?

48:44.132 --> 48:46.092
I was right,

48:46.134 --> 48:48.678
but I swear
I didn't do anything to him.

48:54.142 --> 48:56.811
Sally...

48:56.853 --> 48:58.229
I'm so sorry.

48:58.271 --> 48:59.481
I'm an idiot.

48:59.522 --> 49:01.691
I should have never
put you through that,

49:01.733 --> 49:03.318
but this whole thing,

49:03.360 --> 49:05.987
it taught me one thing.

49:06.029 --> 49:06.988
I love you,

49:07.030 --> 49:09.449
like crazy,

49:09.491 --> 49:10.533
and I still want to marry you

49:10.575 --> 49:12.744
and prove
for the rest of my life

49:12.786 --> 49:14.454
that I deserve you.

49:22.545 --> 49:24.339
Okay.

49:24.381 --> 49:27.175
Why don't we just
go to the wedding rehearsal,

49:27.217 --> 49:29.469
and we can talk about it later?

49:29.511 --> 49:30.136
Okay?

49:30.178 --> 49:30.970
Yeah.

49:41.815 --> 49:44.693
See, I told you
he'd have an explanation.

49:53.493 --> 49:54.786
Matt must have told Sally
some story

49:54.828 --> 49:56.538
to explain himself.

49:56.579 --> 49:58.373
Oh, yeah, he had quite the story
all right.

49:58.415 --> 50:00.583
Wouldn't be surprised
if every word of it was a lie.

50:00.625 --> 50:02.335
Well, Cook wants me
tailing him,

50:02.377 --> 50:04.421
so maybe
we'll know something soon.

50:04.462 --> 50:06.006
Is this wedding
really still on?

50:06.047 --> 50:07.549
I guess so.

50:07.590 --> 50:08.842
We don't have a lot of time
to prove who did this--

50:08.883 --> 50:10.218
No, not "we."

50:10.260 --> 50:11.636
You don't
have to prove anything.

50:11.678 --> 50:12.929
Detective Cook and the
Lawrenceton Police Department

50:12.971 --> 50:13.847
have to prove it.

50:13.888 --> 50:15.432
Fine,

50:15.473 --> 50:17.559
then you all need to prove this
by 5:00 p.m. tomorrow,

50:17.600 --> 50:20.520
or we might have to watch
our friend marry a murderer.

50:21.980 --> 50:23.273
Good point.

50:30.071 --> 50:31.656
Cook!

50:31.698 --> 50:32.866
Smith.

50:32.907 --> 50:34.701
What are you doing here?

50:34.743 --> 50:35.869
I thought I put you on Walker.

50:35.910 --> 50:37.203
I got Timms to tail him.

50:37.245 --> 50:38.538
I thought
you'd want to hear the story

50:38.580 --> 50:39.539
Walker told his fiancée.

50:39.581 --> 50:40.832
Did you?

50:40.874 --> 50:42.792
Yeah, so he was
drinking at a bar

50:42.834 --> 50:45.086
with some guy who dropped him
at his condo

50:45.128 --> 50:46.838
before he walked
to the Great 8 Motel.

50:46.880 --> 50:48.173
Did he spit out a name
for the ride,

50:48.214 --> 50:50.008
or did he just call him
"some guy"?

50:50.050 --> 50:52.177
Uh, he said the guy's name
was Fred Baskin

50:52.218 --> 50:53.345
or maybe Haskins.

50:53.386 --> 50:56.598
So Walker gets dropped off
at his condo,

50:56.639 --> 50:57.724
and then for some reason,

50:57.766 --> 50:58.600
heads over to the Great 8 Motel?

50:58.641 --> 50:59.684
Yeah.

50:59.726 --> 51:01.394
Huh.

51:01.436 --> 51:03.146
Okay, so at least
Walker admits

51:03.188 --> 51:05.023
to being at his condo
that night.

51:05.065 --> 51:06.983
Maybe he did cross paths
with Brody Kresser.

51:07.025 --> 51:08.860
We gotta find this Fred guy.

51:08.902 --> 51:10.570
He's a witness that places
Walker at the crime scene.

51:10.612 --> 51:12.739
You find him,

51:12.781 --> 51:13.907
I'll head over
to the Great 8 Motel,

51:13.948 --> 51:15.241
make sure that he actually
stayed there.

51:15.283 --> 51:16.868
Maybe he left
over some evidence,

51:16.910 --> 51:19.037
perhaps a shard of ceramic.

51:20.080 --> 51:21.581
Looks like the case
against Walker's

51:21.623 --> 51:22.749
coming together.

51:22.791 --> 51:24.459
You should smile, Smith.

51:39.724 --> 51:40.892
Aurora, hey.

51:40.934 --> 51:42.143
-[gasps]
-I didn't mean to scare you.

51:42.185 --> 51:43.395
Just...

51:43.436 --> 51:44.979
did that rehearsal dinner

51:45.021 --> 51:46.690
feel like some weird
alternate reality or what?

51:46.731 --> 51:48.274
Uh, yeah.

51:48.316 --> 51:49.776
I mean, it was a little strange
that they're going on

51:49.818 --> 51:51.152
as if nothing
has happened, but--

51:51.194 --> 51:53.238
I'm curious
what he said to Sally

51:53.279 --> 51:56.241
to make her forget that
he went missing for two days.

51:56.282 --> 51:57.701
Uh, I don't know,

51:57.742 --> 52:00.662
something about wrestling
with self-doubt in a motel room.

52:00.704 --> 52:02.956
Did he say anything else?

52:02.997 --> 52:06.543
Anything about Brody Kresser?

52:06.584 --> 52:08.920
Just that he knew his father.

52:08.962 --> 52:11.131
Did he say how he knew him?

52:11.172 --> 52:13.341
He said he was like
some kind of mentor,

52:13.383 --> 52:14.551
and they had a falling out

52:14.592 --> 52:15.552
over you guys
starting the blog platform.

52:15.593 --> 52:17.053
What?

52:17.095 --> 52:17.971
That...

52:18.013 --> 52:20.223
Wait, is he going around

52:20.265 --> 52:22.058
saying that I knew
this John Kresser?

52:22.100 --> 52:23.518
Did he tell the police that?

52:23.560 --> 52:25.228
I don't know
anything about him.

52:25.270 --> 52:26.646
I don't know
what Matt's got himself into,

52:26.688 --> 52:27.814
but that's on him.

52:27.856 --> 52:30.150
He's not
dragging me down with him.

52:30.191 --> 52:31.359
I've got to make some calls.

52:31.401 --> 52:32.235
Good night.

52:38.074 --> 52:38.992
What?

52:39.034 --> 52:42.704
[bar blues music playing]

52:42.746 --> 52:45.373
[***]

52:58.803 --> 53:02.015
Bartender's out back
signing for a delivery.

53:03.350 --> 53:05.894
You a regular here?

53:05.935 --> 53:07.437
What's it to you?

53:07.479 --> 53:08.563
I'm looking for a guy

53:08.605 --> 53:10.148
who might have been here
two nights ago.

53:10.190 --> 53:11.983
Were you here Wednesday night?

53:14.152 --> 53:15.904
I'll say it again,
what's it to you?

53:17.906 --> 53:19.491
The guy I'm looking for,

53:19.532 --> 53:20.450
his name's Fred Baskin,

53:20.492 --> 53:23.036
or maybe Fred Haskins.

53:23.078 --> 53:24.788
He supposedly hung out
with this guy,

53:24.829 --> 53:25.747
and they closed the place down.

53:25.789 --> 53:26.831
Matty!

53:26.873 --> 53:27.874
Matty the Saddy.

53:27.916 --> 53:29.793
That's what I called him.

53:29.834 --> 53:30.877
Crying in his beer.

53:30.919 --> 53:32.921
Dude owes me 50 bucks.

53:32.962 --> 53:34.756
Wait, you're Fred--

53:34.798 --> 53:35.674
Haskins.

53:38.593 --> 53:40.053
Can I get you a beer?

53:41.221 --> 53:42.597
Sure.

53:44.933 --> 53:46.601
[***]

53:54.109 --> 53:55.694
[Aida calling] Aurora!

53:57.070 --> 53:58.947
Aurora, Arthur's here!

53:58.988 --> 54:00.073
[knocking on door]

54:01.366 --> 54:02.158
Hey.

54:02.200 --> 54:03.952
Do you mind if I, uh--

54:05.787 --> 54:08.289
Wow, pretty retro.

54:08.331 --> 54:09.290
No judging.

54:09.332 --> 54:11.001
I haven't had time
to redecorate.

54:11.042 --> 54:12.711
I'm trying to organize
everything I know

54:12.752 --> 54:14.045
about the Kresser case.

54:14.087 --> 54:15.380
I thought we agreed

54:15.422 --> 54:16.423
you weren't going to get
involved in this case,

54:16.464 --> 54:18.091
or put yourself
in danger anymore.

54:18.133 --> 54:19.300
Arthur, how is me
writing things down

54:19.342 --> 54:20.301
in my own bedroom

54:20.343 --> 54:22.053
getting involved?

54:22.095 --> 54:24.180
It's just me
writing things down.

54:24.222 --> 54:26.433
Now, tell me everything
you know that I don't. Hmm?

54:26.474 --> 54:27.767
Okay, I know this,

54:27.809 --> 54:28.935
Cook confirmed

54:28.977 --> 54:30.395
Matt did stay
at the Great 8 Motel

54:30.437 --> 54:31.646
for two days.

54:31.688 --> 54:34.107
I found this Fred Haskins
Matt told you about.

54:34.149 --> 54:35.900
He was there that night
drinking with Matt,

54:35.942 --> 54:38.111
from 9:30 until
they shut the place down.

54:38.153 --> 54:41.281
Haskins then gave Matt
a ride home at 2:30 a.m.,

54:41.322 --> 54:44.367
way past Brody Kresser's
estimated time of death.

54:44.409 --> 54:46.369
So it seems
Matt does have an alibi.

54:46.411 --> 54:48.371
Okay.

54:48.413 --> 54:50.832
So...

54:50.874 --> 54:52.167
So good.

54:52.208 --> 54:53.877
So Sally's not about
to marry a murderer.

54:53.918 --> 54:56.463
Wait, where did this photo
come from?

54:59.507 --> 55:01.301
The same party
this photo was taken--

55:01.343 --> 55:03.887
John Kresser's birthday
four years ago.

55:03.928 --> 55:05.388
That's John.

55:05.430 --> 55:07.223
Caption said that guy's name
is Albert Paulson.

55:07.265 --> 55:08.683
It didn't say who that guy is.

55:08.725 --> 55:09.809
I know who he is.

55:09.851 --> 55:11.686
I just talked to him
for an hour.

55:11.728 --> 55:14.522
That's Fred Haskins.

55:14.564 --> 55:16.149
Matt and Haskins
didn't meet at the bar.

55:16.191 --> 55:17.692
They knew each other
through John Kresser.

55:20.278 --> 55:21.613
So Matt's alibi is fake.

55:25.116 --> 55:27.702
[groans] We are right back
where we started.

55:27.744 --> 55:31.247
Arthur, what am I
supposed to do?

55:31.289 --> 55:33.625
I'm supposed to meet
Sally and Kara in the morning,

55:33.667 --> 55:35.752
and I'm not sure I'm expected
to just waltz down the aisle

55:35.794 --> 55:37.671
when Sally is probably
going to marry a murderer...

55:39.506 --> 55:41.383
...or if it's not him,
it's his best man,

55:41.424 --> 55:42.842
who was very paranoid
about John Kresser's death.

55:42.884 --> 55:44.177
Oh, really?

55:44.219 --> 55:45.345
Then there's creepy Dawn

55:45.387 --> 55:46.846
who just keeps
showing up everywhere.

55:46.888 --> 55:48.640
I mean, if we can't prove
who this is before the wedding,

55:48.682 --> 55:50.350
it's going to feel like a bomb
is sitting under the church.

55:50.392 --> 55:51.476
First off,

55:51.518 --> 55:52.769
we'll have a tail on Matt
the whole day.

55:52.811 --> 55:55.188
That means Carson will be
under surveillance, too.

55:55.230 --> 55:56.815
That's great, but wouldn't
solving the case be better?

55:56.856 --> 55:58.692
-Roe!
-Let me help.

55:58.733 --> 56:00.610
Come on, think about it.

56:00.652 --> 56:03.154
You wouldn't know that Matt
faked his alibi

56:03.196 --> 56:04.572
if I hadn't found that photo.

56:04.614 --> 56:05.532
Hmm?

56:06.866 --> 56:08.368
[chuckles]

56:08.410 --> 56:09.619
Fine,

56:09.661 --> 56:10.745
but promise me

56:10.787 --> 56:11.996
that if you come up with
any leads,

56:12.038 --> 56:14.749
you won't go chasing after them
on your own.

56:14.791 --> 56:17.669
Fine, I promise.

56:17.711 --> 56:18.837
Okay.

56:20.463 --> 56:22.090
You know...

56:22.132 --> 56:24.092
life was starting to seem
nice and predictable,

56:24.134 --> 56:26.177
even a bit boring...

56:28.763 --> 56:30.223
...then you came back to town.

56:32.684 --> 56:33.727
You're welcome.

56:33.768 --> 56:34.602
[chuckles]

56:36.521 --> 56:38.231
[***]

56:47.991 --> 56:50.785
Okay, Albert Paulson,

56:50.827 --> 56:53.038
let's find out who you are.

56:53.079 --> 56:55.623
[***]

56:56.750 --> 56:58.084
It's cold today.

56:58.126 --> 56:59.961
I'm glad it's not
an outdoor wedding.

57:00.003 --> 57:01.588
You're a little early,
aren't you?

57:01.629 --> 57:03.256
Well, I didn't want you
to have to do all the work.

57:03.298 --> 57:05.258
I thought I could help chop
or stir or something.

57:05.300 --> 57:06.843
Ah, don't worry about it.

57:06.885 --> 57:08.636
I'm making a prosciutto quiche
with spinach and feta cheese.

57:08.678 --> 57:09.763
Wow.

57:09.804 --> 57:11.306
That sounds incredible.

57:11.348 --> 57:13.058
I really didn't mean for you
to go through that much trouble.

57:13.099 --> 57:14.517
It's your best friend's
wedding.

57:14.559 --> 57:16.394
Plus, I'm a sucker for romance.

57:17.395 --> 57:18.438
Hmm.

57:18.480 --> 57:20.440
I don't have time for romance.

57:20.482 --> 57:22.734
Between writing a thesis
and having two jobs,

57:22.776 --> 57:23.485
I have no time to date.

57:24.569 --> 57:27.322
You're going
to a wedding tonight.

57:27.364 --> 57:29.741
Feels like a perfect occasion
for a date.

57:31.326 --> 57:34.829
Are you trying to get me
to bring you as my date?

57:34.871 --> 57:36.164
Is it working?

57:37.374 --> 57:38.291
Maybe.

57:38.333 --> 57:39.376
[cell phone ringing]

57:39.417 --> 57:41.336
Oh, um...

57:41.378 --> 57:43.296
Hi, this is Roe Teagarden.

57:43.338 --> 57:44.464
Is this Albert Paulson?

57:44.506 --> 57:46.633
As if he'd be here
on a Saturday!

57:46.675 --> 57:48.385
No, I'm his paralegal.

57:48.426 --> 57:50.679
I screen emails
from our contact inbox.

57:50.720 --> 57:52.222
You said
you're researching a story

57:52.263 --> 57:53.682
about John Kresser?

57:53.723 --> 57:55.308
So to speak.

57:55.350 --> 57:56.726
I know that John Kresser
and your boss

57:56.768 --> 57:57.936
were very close friends.

57:57.977 --> 57:59.437
Like brothers.

57:59.479 --> 58:00.939
Ah, such a sweetheart.

58:00.980 --> 58:03.650
I don't think I'll ever
get over him dying like he did.

58:03.692 --> 58:04.859
So sad,

58:04.901 --> 58:06.027
and so weird

58:06.069 --> 58:07.237
and out of nowhere.

58:07.278 --> 58:08.905
Um, are you saying

58:08.947 --> 58:09.948
that John Kresser's death

58:09.989 --> 58:11.366
was suspicious?

58:11.408 --> 58:13.618
He dies in an accident

58:13.660 --> 58:16.121
three days before he was
about to file his lawsuit?

58:16.162 --> 58:18.748
Why the police chose
not to investigate it,

58:18.790 --> 58:19.624
I'll never know.

58:19.666 --> 58:20.792
Wait, wait,

58:20.834 --> 58:23.670
John Kresser
was going to file a lawsuit?

58:23.712 --> 58:26.840
[***]

58:26.881 --> 58:28.341
[giggling]

58:30.051 --> 58:31.052
[Sally] Hey, Roe!

58:31.094 --> 58:32.178
It's your wedding day!

58:32.220 --> 58:34.347
I'm so nervous.

58:34.389 --> 58:35.890
Okay, so I had this dream
last night

58:35.932 --> 58:38.226
that I put on my wedding dress,
and it turned black.

58:38.268 --> 58:39.728
Do you think that's a bad omen?

58:41.062 --> 58:42.397
I hope you're hungry,

58:42.439 --> 58:43.857
'cause my friend, Daniel,
is making us a feast.

58:43.898 --> 58:45.650
Oh, I forgot.

58:45.692 --> 58:46.985
I have to grab my bridesmaids'
presents out of my car--

58:47.027 --> 58:48.319
That's okay, I'll go grab them.

58:48.361 --> 58:50.196
You are the best.

58:50.238 --> 58:52.907
Oh, you know what,
why don't you take this?

58:52.949 --> 58:54.075
It's really cold.

58:54.117 --> 58:55.285
Keys are in the pocket.

58:55.326 --> 58:57.203
Presents are in the trunk.

58:57.245 --> 58:58.580
-Thank you!
-[cell phone ringing]

58:58.621 --> 58:59.873
Okay. Oh!

58:59.914 --> 59:00.749
Look at all this!

59:00.790 --> 59:02.375
Arthur, hey.

59:02.417 --> 59:04.085
Please tell me
you have the evidence you need

59:04.127 --> 59:05.170
to make an arrest today.

59:05.211 --> 59:06.379
[Arthur] Not yet,

59:06.421 --> 59:08.006
but I found
a report for the crash

59:08.048 --> 59:09.716
that killed John Kresser.

59:09.758 --> 59:11.134
His car broke through
the guard rail,

59:11.176 --> 59:13.803
went off into a ravine.

59:13.845 --> 59:15.555
Also, I spoke with Carson
this morning,

59:15.597 --> 59:18.141
asked him about that
and about Haskins.

59:18.183 --> 59:19.601
He didn't respond well.

59:19.642 --> 59:21.144
Refused to talk to us
without his lawyer present.

59:21.186 --> 59:22.937
Then there's Dawn.

59:22.979 --> 59:25.106
What about her?

59:25.148 --> 59:26.983
Well, Cook has me
tailing her today,

59:27.025 --> 59:29.527
and she has decided
to tail Sally.

59:29.569 --> 59:30.945
She's outside the diner

59:30.987 --> 59:32.447
you guys are
having breakfast at right now,

59:32.489 --> 59:34.824
sitting in her car
in the parking lot.

59:34.866 --> 59:36.326
If she makes a move
on the diner,

59:36.368 --> 59:39.287
I'll arrest her for harassment.

59:39.329 --> 59:42.123
Good to know
Officer Smith is on the job.

59:42.165 --> 59:43.833
You getting out of here?

59:43.875 --> 59:44.876
Oh, no, I'll be right back!

59:44.918 --> 59:46.795
Oh, don't let me forget.

59:46.836 --> 59:47.837
After breakfast,

59:47.879 --> 59:49.214
I have to tell you
about a lawsuit

59:49.255 --> 59:51.091
John Kresser was about to file
before he died.

59:51.132 --> 59:52.258
I convinced
his lawyer's paralegal

59:52.300 --> 59:53.301
to fax me over a draft copy.

59:53.343 --> 59:54.260
I'll call you after.

59:54.302 --> 59:55.261
A lawsuit?

59:55.303 --> 59:57.514
After breakfast.

01:00:03.937 --> 01:00:05.689
[engine revving, tires skidding]

01:00:07.148 --> 01:00:07.816
[Arthur's voice echoing] Roe!

01:00:14.197 --> 01:00:15.448
[tires skidding]

01:00:20.245 --> 01:00:22.831
Roe! Roe!

01:00:22.872 --> 01:00:24.082
Are you okay?

01:00:24.124 --> 01:00:25.166
-Yeah, I'm okay. Are you okay?
-Yeah.

01:00:25.208 --> 01:00:26.334
Roe, you okay?

01:00:26.376 --> 01:00:27.460
Yeah, I'm fine.

01:00:31.006 --> 01:00:32.173
You okay?

01:00:32.215 --> 01:00:33.633
Are you okay?

01:00:33.675 --> 01:00:34.467
I want you
to get out of the vehicle,

01:00:34.509 --> 01:00:36.803
slowly raise your hands.

01:00:36.845 --> 01:00:39.014
There you go.
Are you carrying a weapon?

01:00:41.850 --> 01:00:44.102
You may have just helped
catch a killer.

01:00:56.781 --> 01:00:57.907
I wasn't trying to get her.

01:00:57.949 --> 01:00:59.325
I thought it was Sally.

01:00:59.367 --> 01:01:00.869
I had to stop her
from trying to marry my Matt!

01:01:06.166 --> 01:01:07.334
[Sally] You were almost killed

01:01:07.375 --> 01:01:08.626
because she thought you were me.

01:01:08.668 --> 01:01:10.420
Sally, I'm okay.

01:01:10.462 --> 01:01:11.671
[Arthur]
You sure you're okay, Roe?

01:01:11.713 --> 01:01:12.714
Yeah.

01:01:12.756 --> 01:01:13.840
Just cold.

01:01:13.882 --> 01:01:15.175
Here, you can borrow this.

01:01:15.216 --> 01:01:16.718
No, it's okay, Arthur, really.

01:01:19.512 --> 01:01:20.472
Thank you.

01:01:20.513 --> 01:01:21.348
Of course.

01:01:25.143 --> 01:01:26.269
[Arthur] I told you

01:01:26.311 --> 01:01:27.604
getting involved
in this case was trouble.

01:01:27.645 --> 01:01:30.190
Arthur, I was just
getting presents out of the car.

01:01:30.231 --> 01:01:31.483
[Kara] But clearly,
Dawn is violent

01:01:31.524 --> 01:01:33.401
and not as harmless
as Matt thought.

01:01:33.443 --> 01:01:35.695
I mean, she must be the one
who killed Brody, right?

01:01:35.737 --> 01:01:38.365
Maybe she thought
she was protecting him?

01:01:38.406 --> 01:01:40.617
It's a possibility,
but we're still investigating.

01:01:40.658 --> 01:01:42.577
How am I
supposed to get married

01:01:42.619 --> 01:01:44.537
when my best friend
was nearly run over?

01:01:44.579 --> 01:01:45.622
[Arthur] Postponing the wedding

01:01:45.663 --> 01:01:46.915
until we find out
who killed Kresser

01:01:46.956 --> 01:01:48.541
might not be a bad idea, Sal.

01:01:48.583 --> 01:01:50.627
Yeah, I mean, maybe
just for a week or two?

01:01:53.546 --> 01:01:54.714
Maybe that's what's best.

01:01:56.049 --> 01:01:56.883
[Kara] What are you guys
talking about?

01:01:56.925 --> 01:01:58.927
How is that what's best?

01:01:58.968 --> 01:02:00.178
Dawn wanted
to stop the wedding,

01:02:00.220 --> 01:02:02.347
and now you're going
to let her have her way?

01:02:06.893 --> 01:02:08.978
You're right.

01:02:09.020 --> 01:02:13.191
I'm not going to let Dawn
take mine and Matt's happiness.

01:02:13.233 --> 01:02:14.401
[sniffles]

01:02:14.442 --> 01:02:16.569
Let's go back inside.

01:02:16.611 --> 01:02:17.612
Okay?

01:02:26.121 --> 01:02:27.664
I gotta say thanks

01:02:27.706 --> 01:02:28.665
for pulling Roe out of the way
of that car.

01:02:31.209 --> 01:02:34.421
I wasn't sure
if I was about to watch her...

01:02:37.632 --> 01:02:39.509
Anyway, uh, Roe,

01:02:39.551 --> 01:02:41.428
I'll let you know
what happens with Dawn,

01:02:41.469 --> 01:02:44.305
and then I'd like
to see that lawsuit.

01:02:51.062 --> 01:02:52.647
[Daniel]
I'd say that guy's into you.

01:02:52.689 --> 01:02:54.482
Arthur?

01:02:54.524 --> 01:02:57.318
No, for as long
as we've been friends?

01:02:57.360 --> 01:02:59.362
Hey, you want to keep him
in the friend zone,

01:02:59.404 --> 01:03:01.031
I'm not gonna argue.

01:03:02.782 --> 01:03:04.451
I've got to get
that quiche out of the oven.

01:03:22.302 --> 01:03:25.138
[Dawn] Oh, my god,
you're totally overreacting.

01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:28.433
Yeah, I tried to hit Sally,
but I wasn't trying to kill her.

01:03:28.475 --> 01:03:29.768
I just wanted to maybe
break her leg a little bit

01:03:29.809 --> 01:03:31.353
so she couldn't
walk down the aisle.

01:03:34.022 --> 01:03:35.732
You think I'm crazy.

01:03:35.774 --> 01:03:37.817
Well, I'm not.

01:03:37.859 --> 01:03:41.654
Sally isn't the goody-two-shoes
that you think.

01:03:41.696 --> 01:03:44.449
She somehow tricked Matt
into marrying her,

01:03:44.491 --> 01:03:47.827
when I know that I'm the one
that he really loves.

01:03:47.869 --> 01:03:50.789
Okay, so you tried
to break Sally's legs

01:03:50.830 --> 01:03:51.706
to help Matt.

01:03:53.625 --> 01:03:55.752
Did you try breaking
Brody Kresser's head

01:03:55.794 --> 01:03:56.628
to help Matt, too?

01:03:57.754 --> 01:03:58.588
Brody who?

01:04:01.257 --> 01:04:03.218
Is this your handiwork?

01:04:03.259 --> 01:04:05.095
Did you attack this man
in Matt's condo,

01:04:05.136 --> 01:04:06.513
then push him off the balcony?

01:04:06.554 --> 01:04:08.390
No, I did not do that.

01:04:08.431 --> 01:04:09.683
[Arthur] But you were
at his condo that night,

01:04:09.724 --> 01:04:10.850
the night of the party?

01:04:10.892 --> 01:04:13.770
You told my friend
that you saw Matt.

01:04:13.812 --> 01:04:15.772
What time
did you see him there?

01:04:15.814 --> 01:04:18.274
If I saw Matt,
I wouldn't tell you.

01:04:18.316 --> 01:04:21.986
I will never betray Matt.

01:04:22.028 --> 01:04:24.489
Never.

01:04:35.375 --> 01:04:37.043
Oh!

01:04:37.085 --> 01:04:39.754
I'm just going to place this
on the bridal table.

01:04:41.006 --> 01:04:44.634
Oh, Sally did
such a fantastic job decorating.

01:04:44.676 --> 01:04:47.178
Ah, yes, she's quite talented.

01:04:47.220 --> 01:04:48.805
I have a friend

01:04:48.847 --> 01:04:50.932
who is, uh, interested
in selling her home,

01:04:50.974 --> 01:04:53.560
and I recommended you
as a listing agent.

01:04:53.601 --> 01:04:55.562
She's expecting eight figures

01:04:55.603 --> 01:04:58.106
and is very particular.

01:04:58.148 --> 01:05:00.608
Well, thank you
for the recommendation, Gladys,

01:05:00.650 --> 01:05:03.403
but you know, my office hasn't
been very productive lately,

01:05:03.445 --> 01:05:05.071
so maybe after I get
a few more listings,

01:05:05.113 --> 01:05:06.364
I could call her--

01:05:06.406 --> 01:05:08.199
I told her that you were
a very skilled woman

01:05:08.241 --> 01:05:09.743
with rare gumption,

01:05:09.784 --> 01:05:12.912
and you'd be very enthusiastic
about helping her out.

01:05:12.954 --> 01:05:14.581
Was I mistaken?

01:05:14.622 --> 01:05:15.915
No.

01:05:15.957 --> 01:05:19.169
I... I just may have mislaid
my gumption lately.

01:05:19.210 --> 01:05:21.379
Well, I suggest
that you find it

01:05:21.421 --> 01:05:23.131
before you give her a call.

01:05:23.173 --> 01:05:25.008
I've got her card right here.

01:05:25.050 --> 01:05:26.051
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

01:05:27.677 --> 01:05:29.471
Morning, Aida.
Aunt Gladys.

01:05:29.512 --> 01:05:31.097
-Hello.
-Hi!

01:05:31.139 --> 01:05:31.931
Just dropping off
the champagne.

01:05:31.973 --> 01:05:32.974
Splendid.

01:05:34.684 --> 01:05:35.810
Matthew!

01:05:36.853 --> 01:05:37.937
Carson.

01:05:37.979 --> 01:05:39.773
Where you been, buddy?

01:05:39.814 --> 01:05:41.441
You're ducking
your best-man duties.

01:05:41.483 --> 01:05:42.734
What's with this text
you sent me?

01:05:42.776 --> 01:05:45.111
You grabbing screenshots
of our emails?

01:05:45.153 --> 01:05:46.279
I want that flash drive--

01:05:46.321 --> 01:05:48.073
Shh!

01:05:50.784 --> 01:05:53.286
I told you,
I'm not gonna use it.

01:05:53.328 --> 01:05:54.746
I just wanted some insurance

01:05:54.788 --> 01:05:58.249
to make sure you don't do to me
what you did to John.

01:05:58.291 --> 01:05:59.542
Look, I will give you the drive

01:05:59.584 --> 01:06:01.503
after the sale goes through,

01:06:01.544 --> 01:06:02.837
and I get my half of the money.

01:06:02.879 --> 01:06:04.005
You don't want to play
that game with me,

01:06:04.047 --> 01:06:05.548
especially not
when Sally's cop friend

01:06:05.590 --> 01:06:06.675
is asking me about Fred Haskins.

01:06:08.343 --> 01:06:10.095
Haskins, Matt!

01:06:10.136 --> 01:06:10.970
You pulled him into this?

01:06:11.012 --> 01:06:11.846
You're an idiot.

01:06:11.888 --> 01:06:12.931
[Matt] Why?

01:06:12.972 --> 01:06:14.015
Because I don't want
to take the blame

01:06:14.057 --> 01:06:15.183
for something I didn't do?

01:06:15.225 --> 01:06:17.644
Always playing innocent,
but I know better.

01:06:17.686 --> 01:06:19.813
There's no way I'm going
to let you use Haskins

01:06:19.854 --> 01:06:21.106
to set me up to take the fall
for what you did.

01:06:25.402 --> 01:06:27.821
Matt, is everything okay?

01:06:27.862 --> 01:06:29.489
Uh...

01:06:29.531 --> 01:06:30.990
yeah, yeah, everything's great.

01:06:31.032 --> 01:06:34.077
We're just a little on edge
about the big event.

01:06:34.119 --> 01:06:35.912
-Weddings.
-Yeah.

01:06:35.954 --> 01:06:37.997
You know what,
there's another box outside.

01:06:38.039 --> 01:06:39.374
I'm gonna go grab it.

01:06:39.416 --> 01:06:40.542
Okay.

01:06:48.341 --> 01:06:50.552
[cell phone ringing]

01:06:51.553 --> 01:06:52.804
Hey, Arthur.

01:06:52.846 --> 01:06:53.805
I'm just on my way
to meet Sally and Kara.

01:06:53.847 --> 01:06:54.723
What's up?

01:06:54.764 --> 01:06:55.807
Well, despite Dawn Palmer

01:06:55.849 --> 01:06:57.517
trying to run down
her ex's bride,

01:06:57.559 --> 01:06:59.686
she didn't kill Brody Kresser.

01:06:59.728 --> 01:07:00.603
In fact, she was nowhere near
Matt's condo building

01:07:00.645 --> 01:07:02.564
that night.

01:07:02.605 --> 01:07:04.566
Her father showed us proof
that she was with him,

01:07:04.607 --> 01:07:06.818
and the restaurant
they were at confirmed.

01:07:06.860 --> 01:07:08.486
Well, I guess
that's good for her,

01:07:08.528 --> 01:07:10.030
but bad for Sally.

01:07:10.071 --> 01:07:11.197
I mean, that means Matt

01:07:11.239 --> 01:07:12.240
is still most likely
the one who did it.

01:07:12.282 --> 01:07:13.491
Maybe, maybe not.

01:07:13.533 --> 01:07:15.285
We just got access
to security footage

01:07:15.326 --> 01:07:16.911
taken from the Cedarbridge Inn
the night of the party.

01:07:16.953 --> 01:07:18.371
And?

01:07:18.413 --> 01:07:19.622
Well, it seems

01:07:19.664 --> 01:07:22.250
Carson confronted Brody
after they left,

01:07:22.292 --> 01:07:23.668
and it clearly got physical.

01:07:23.710 --> 01:07:25.003
I don't know.

01:07:25.045 --> 01:07:26.504
Something's missing.

01:07:26.546 --> 01:07:28.131
So why don't you tell me

01:07:28.173 --> 01:07:29.466
what's in that lawsuit
you've been talking about?

01:07:29.507 --> 01:07:32.218
Well, I don't really know
what's in it yet.

01:07:32.260 --> 01:07:33.511
I mean, I had it faxed

01:07:33.553 --> 01:07:35.138
to the only place I know
with a fax machine--

01:07:35.180 --> 01:07:36.222
my professor's office,

01:07:36.264 --> 01:07:38.266
but look,

01:07:38.308 --> 01:07:39.726
I'm supposed to meet
Sally and Kara at the salon,

01:07:39.768 --> 01:07:41.561
but I'll go pick up
the lawsuit document

01:07:41.603 --> 01:07:42.479
and call you back from there?

01:07:42.520 --> 01:07:43.271
Sounds good.

01:07:44.939 --> 01:07:46.107
[groans]

01:07:50.111 --> 01:07:52.405
[sighs]

01:07:52.447 --> 01:07:54.824
You look beautiful, Sally.

01:07:54.866 --> 01:07:56.409
I just...

01:07:56.451 --> 01:07:58.536
Oh, I needed to try it on
one last time.

01:07:58.578 --> 01:07:59.621
With everything
that's happened,

01:07:59.662 --> 01:08:00.413
I was just really nervous.
[chuckles]

01:08:00.455 --> 01:08:02.165
Yeah.

01:08:02.207 --> 01:08:03.416
Well, it's going to be okay.

01:08:03.458 --> 01:08:05.126
Okay? I promise personally.

01:08:07.462 --> 01:08:09.964
Let me get your veil
and my bubbles.

01:08:10.006 --> 01:08:11.466
[laughing]

01:08:11.508 --> 01:08:12.425
We have so much to do
before the ceremony.

01:08:12.467 --> 01:08:13.593
I love you.

01:08:13.635 --> 01:08:14.552
-Love you.
-See you soon.

01:08:14.594 --> 01:08:16.388
Hey.

01:08:16.429 --> 01:08:18.098
Carson!

01:08:18.139 --> 01:08:19.849
[giggling]

01:08:19.891 --> 01:08:21.559
I'm sorry to do this, Sally,

01:08:21.601 --> 01:08:22.894
I really am--

01:08:22.936 --> 01:08:25.730
Okay, Sally,
I really need to talk to you!

01:08:25.772 --> 01:08:27.315
Roe, your hair,
why haven't you--

01:08:27.357 --> 01:08:28.441
Okay, forget about my hair,

01:08:28.483 --> 01:08:29.317
there is something
really important

01:08:29.359 --> 01:08:30.360
I need to tell you--

01:08:30.402 --> 01:08:31.986
What you both need to do

01:08:32.028 --> 01:08:34.197
is stop talking

01:08:34.239 --> 01:08:35.657
and listen to me.

01:08:48.294 --> 01:08:49.838
[Carson] No need
to fall apart on me, Sally.

01:08:49.879 --> 01:08:51.214
I'm not going to hurt you.

01:08:51.256 --> 01:08:53.633
I just need to get
Matt's attention,

01:08:53.675 --> 01:08:55.260
and get him to hand me
a flash drive

01:08:55.301 --> 01:08:56.886
that he's using to threaten me.

01:08:56.928 --> 01:08:58.763
Why would Matt
want to threaten you?

01:08:58.805 --> 01:09:00.348
You're his best friend.

01:09:00.390 --> 01:09:02.058
Well, that
may have been true once,

01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:03.768
but not anymore.

01:09:03.810 --> 01:09:05.854
That's what happens
when you commit crimes together.

01:09:05.895 --> 01:09:06.938
What?

01:09:06.980 --> 01:09:09.107
What crimes?

01:09:09.149 --> 01:09:10.608
Well, first,

01:09:10.650 --> 01:09:12.819
Matt and Carson stole the idea
for Giggoblog

01:09:12.861 --> 01:09:14.029
from Brody Kresser's father.

01:09:14.070 --> 01:09:15.989
No. No.

01:09:16.031 --> 01:09:17.949
Giggoblog was Matt's idea,
and mine.

01:09:17.991 --> 01:09:19.242
We came up with it.

01:09:19.284 --> 01:09:21.411
But John Kresser
wrote the code for it.

01:09:22.829 --> 01:09:24.456
Okay, yeah.

01:09:24.497 --> 01:09:27.042
Matt's first pass
at writing the code

01:09:27.083 --> 01:09:28.001
didn't work well.

01:09:28.043 --> 01:09:29.627
John revised it,

01:09:29.669 --> 01:09:30.628
added a few things,

01:09:30.670 --> 01:09:32.714
but then he got greedy.

01:09:32.756 --> 01:09:34.591
Demanded half a stake
in the company,

01:09:34.632 --> 01:09:36.968
when I was the one
who wrote the business plan,

01:09:37.010 --> 01:09:38.303
found the investors.

01:09:38.345 --> 01:09:39.971
We did months of work.

01:09:40.013 --> 01:09:42.557
He writes code for a week
and wants half?

01:09:42.599 --> 01:09:44.517
No...

01:09:44.559 --> 01:09:45.935
No way.

01:09:45.977 --> 01:09:47.437
[Roe] Is that really
what you believe?

01:09:48.897 --> 01:09:50.523
This is a draft of the lawsuit

01:09:50.565 --> 01:09:51.983
that John Kresser
was going to file

01:09:52.025 --> 01:09:53.818
against Giggoblog.

01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.320
He did expect a 50% share.

01:09:55.362 --> 01:09:56.654
He was promised it

01:09:56.696 --> 01:09:59.324
when he did more than 90%
of the platform's code.

01:09:59.366 --> 01:10:00.200
There's a list
of exhibits in here

01:10:00.241 --> 01:10:01.659
that support his claim.

01:10:01.701 --> 01:10:02.827
Is this true?

01:10:02.869 --> 01:10:04.996
Did you and Matt
steal someone else's work?

01:10:05.038 --> 01:10:07.040
There's also a copy
of an affidavit

01:10:07.082 --> 01:10:08.458
signed by Fred Haskins

01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.584
who claimed
he wrote some of the code,

01:10:09.626 --> 01:10:12.045
but Fred Haskins
doesn't write code.

01:10:12.087 --> 01:10:13.672
He's a licensed plumber,

01:10:13.713 --> 01:10:14.964
currently unemployed.

01:10:15.006 --> 01:10:16.174
Unless, of course,

01:10:16.216 --> 01:10:18.009
you count providing
fake alibis and evidence

01:10:18.051 --> 01:10:19.010
as employment.

01:10:19.052 --> 01:10:20.387
Okay, all right, all right,

01:10:20.428 --> 01:10:22.472
that's enough, Aurora.

01:10:22.514 --> 01:10:24.474
I mean it.

01:10:24.516 --> 01:10:26.601
Either you stop talking

01:10:26.643 --> 01:10:28.395
about stuff
you don't know about, or--

01:10:28.436 --> 01:10:29.688
Or what?

01:10:29.729 --> 01:10:31.564
You're gonna hire Haskins
to run me off the road

01:10:31.606 --> 01:10:33.191
the same way you hired him
to do to John Kresser?

01:10:33.233 --> 01:10:36.277
Roe, what are you saying?

01:10:38.571 --> 01:10:40.907
John was conveniently killed
in a car crash

01:10:40.949 --> 01:10:44.577
three days before this lawsuit
was supposed to be filed,

01:10:44.619 --> 01:10:48.373
and I saw Matt deleting an email
between him and Carson

01:10:48.415 --> 01:10:50.083
saying someone had been paid,

01:10:50.125 --> 01:10:52.711
and wouldn't be asking for more.

01:10:52.752 --> 01:10:55.714
Carson, is that email
on the flash drive you want?

01:10:55.755 --> 01:10:57.966
The proof that you and Matt
paid to have someone killed?

01:11:00.719 --> 01:11:01.511
Sally, call Matt,

01:11:01.553 --> 01:11:03.054
tell him to get himself here

01:11:03.096 --> 01:11:05.223
and hand me that flash drive

01:11:05.265 --> 01:11:06.474
if he ever
wants to see you again.

01:11:11.062 --> 01:11:11.938
Do it now!

01:11:13.064 --> 01:11:14.941
Okay...

01:11:19.404 --> 01:11:23.033
Hey, you know what?
I'll do it.

01:11:28.955 --> 01:11:30.707
Hey, Matt, it's Roe.

01:11:30.749 --> 01:11:34.127
Yeah, I know, just, uh,
listen carefully, okay?

01:11:34.169 --> 01:11:36.296
Carson has taken
Sally and me hostage

01:11:36.338 --> 01:11:37.380
at the Cedarbridge Inn.

01:11:37.422 --> 01:11:39.090
He has a gun.

01:11:39.132 --> 01:11:40.175
He wants the flash drive--

01:11:40.216 --> 01:11:42.844
Tell him no police,

01:11:42.886 --> 01:11:43.928
or Sally dies.

01:11:43.970 --> 01:11:45.930
He heard you.

01:11:45.972 --> 01:11:48.099
He understands.

01:11:48.141 --> 01:11:49.809
Please hurry.

01:11:51.061 --> 01:11:52.312
It's okay, all right?

01:11:52.354 --> 01:11:53.938
Help is on the way.

01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:54.898
Matt's on the way.

01:11:54.939 --> 01:11:56.107
Good.

01:11:56.149 --> 01:11:57.442
I'll get my flash drive,

01:11:57.484 --> 01:11:59.778
and I'll be on my way.

01:11:59.819 --> 01:12:00.987
[Roe] You really think

01:12:01.029 --> 01:12:02.322
the police
are just going to let you walk?

01:12:03.323 --> 01:12:05.367
Carson, you paid for a murder.

01:12:05.408 --> 01:12:06.534
Probably two.

01:12:06.576 --> 01:12:08.286
Oh, I did not kill
Brody Kresser.

01:12:08.328 --> 01:12:09.287
No, that...

01:12:09.329 --> 01:12:10.455
that's all Matt.

01:12:10.497 --> 01:12:12.874
That's not true!

01:12:12.916 --> 01:12:14.209
He would never...

01:12:14.250 --> 01:12:16.211
I didn't think
he had it in him either,

01:12:16.252 --> 01:12:17.754
but what do you know,
when push came to shove,

01:12:17.796 --> 01:12:18.963
Matt got it together

01:12:19.005 --> 01:12:23.093
and shoved John's greedy kid
off his balcony.

01:12:26.554 --> 01:12:28.139
[rattling door handle]

01:12:28.181 --> 01:12:30.433
[chuckling] Um... hey, Sally?

01:12:30.475 --> 01:12:31.309
I think somehow the door locked.

01:12:31.351 --> 01:12:33.186
[knocking] Hey, Sally?

01:12:33.228 --> 01:12:35.021
Um... hey, Kara!

01:12:35.063 --> 01:12:36.856
Uh, Sally's fine.

01:12:36.898 --> 01:12:38.858
She's just got, um...

01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:40.402
pre-wedding jitters.

01:12:40.443 --> 01:12:42.821
Um, why don't you go across
to the church,

01:12:42.862 --> 01:12:44.823
and you can be ready to help her
when we get there?

01:12:44.864 --> 01:12:46.199
[Kara] Uh, no, um...

01:12:46.241 --> 01:12:47.492
the bridesmaids aren't
supposed to leave the bride.

01:12:47.534 --> 01:12:51.454
I think I'll just, uh,
I'll just wait out here.

01:12:58.628 --> 01:12:59.587
Carson...

01:13:01.256 --> 01:13:03.008
...you actually believe
Matt killed Brody.

01:13:03.049 --> 01:13:05.593
You're not just saying that
to throw the blame off yourself.

01:13:05.635 --> 01:13:06.928
Well, how could I do it?

01:13:06.970 --> 01:13:09.014
With the combination
on that lock on his door,

01:13:09.055 --> 01:13:10.515
I have no way to get in.

01:13:11.891 --> 01:13:14.894
Him and his stupid system
of changing the combinations...

01:13:14.936 --> 01:13:16.229
Wait, he has a system?

01:13:16.271 --> 01:13:17.522
Based on what?

01:13:17.564 --> 01:13:18.815
Stuff from before we met.

01:13:18.857 --> 01:13:20.108
Childhood pets,

01:13:20.150 --> 01:13:22.193
dogs, cats, lizards, whatever...

01:13:22.235 --> 01:13:23.570
The point is

01:13:23.611 --> 01:13:25.864
we all know
Kresser was hit on the head

01:13:25.905 --> 01:13:28.283
inside the condo, hmm?

01:13:28.324 --> 01:13:31.453
And Matt is the only person
who can get in,

01:13:31.494 --> 01:13:33.788
so put two and two together.

01:13:33.830 --> 01:13:35.040
He did it.

01:13:35.081 --> 01:13:36.916
No, Matt is a gentle soul!

01:13:38.835 --> 01:13:40.503
Love is blind.

01:13:40.545 --> 01:13:42.464
Speaking of, where is Matt?

01:13:43.423 --> 01:13:45.008
Huh? Where is he?

01:13:46.926 --> 01:13:47.761
Call him again.

01:13:49.429 --> 01:13:50.221
I need to talk to him
this time.

01:13:50.263 --> 01:13:53.391
Sally, no.

01:13:53.433 --> 01:13:55.810
Trust me, okay?

01:14:00.690 --> 01:14:02.901
-Hey!
-Kara, where's Sally?

01:14:02.942 --> 01:14:04.110
In there.

01:14:04.152 --> 01:14:05.528
-Back up, back up.
-What's going on, Matt?

01:14:05.570 --> 01:14:06.363
[knocking urgently]
Sally, hey!

01:14:06.404 --> 01:14:07.322
Hey, it's me.

01:14:07.364 --> 01:14:08.698
Matt, be careful!

01:14:12.619 --> 01:14:13.703
We're gonna go out that door...

01:14:15.872 --> 01:14:17.916
...and he's going to hand me
the flash drive.

01:14:17.957 --> 01:14:20.627
You hear that, Matty?

01:14:20.669 --> 01:14:21.836
Yeah.

01:14:21.878 --> 01:14:22.796
Yeah, I heard you.

01:14:22.837 --> 01:14:23.963
I have the drive.

01:14:26.341 --> 01:14:27.801
[Carson] Open the door.

01:14:31.346 --> 01:14:32.639
Sally, it's going to be okay.

01:14:34.391 --> 01:14:35.600
Carson, come on,
she has nothing to do with this.

01:14:36.643 --> 01:14:39.187
Give me the drive.

01:14:39.229 --> 01:14:42.065
Sorry, Sally.

01:14:43.400 --> 01:14:45.443
[sobbing]

01:14:45.485 --> 01:14:48.488
[Carson] Now...

01:14:48.530 --> 01:14:49.280
you're gonna let me
through the front door,

01:14:49.322 --> 01:14:50.448
so I can get outta here,

01:14:50.490 --> 01:14:53.410
then you can have
your little wedding.

01:14:53.451 --> 01:14:54.244
Carson, whatever it is
you're trying to do,

01:14:54.285 --> 01:14:55.286
you need to stop--

01:14:55.328 --> 01:14:57.288
Stop talking, Kara!

01:14:57.330 --> 01:14:58.456
Stop it right now.

01:14:58.498 --> 01:14:59.791
Hey, hey, hey, look.
Look at me.

01:14:59.833 --> 01:15:03.211
I should have never
made the drive, okay?

01:15:03.253 --> 01:15:04.462
When Haskins called me,

01:15:04.504 --> 01:15:05.964
he said that you had
already contacted him.

01:15:06.006 --> 01:15:07.048
How was I supposed to know
I wasn't next?

01:15:07.090 --> 01:15:10.343
Shut up
and let me get out of here!

01:15:10.385 --> 01:15:11.761
Drop it, Carson!
Let her go.

01:15:11.803 --> 01:15:13.179
Hey, come here, come here.

01:15:13.221 --> 01:15:15.390
You're okay, you're okay,
you're okay, you're okay...

01:15:15.432 --> 01:15:16.516
[sobbing]

01:15:19.519 --> 01:15:20.979
Anything you say

01:15:21.021 --> 01:15:23.231
can and will be used against you
in a court of law.

01:15:23.273 --> 01:15:24.482
You have the right
to an attorney.

01:15:24.524 --> 01:15:25.483
If you choose not to have one,

01:15:25.525 --> 01:15:27.277
one will be appointed to you.

01:15:27.318 --> 01:15:28.695
[Arthur] Nice ruse,

01:15:28.737 --> 01:15:30.113
calling me when he thought
you were calling Matt.

01:15:30.155 --> 01:15:32.407
This reminds me of the end
of that true-crime book

01:15:32.449 --> 01:15:33.783
you gave me on the Evans' case.

01:15:33.825 --> 01:15:35.785
The wrong guy arrested,

01:15:35.827 --> 01:15:37.037
and it was a whole year

01:15:37.078 --> 01:15:38.288
before the new detective
on the case realized

01:15:38.329 --> 01:15:40.331
the pieces didn't add up.

01:15:40.373 --> 01:15:41.958
The floor
where the murder happened

01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.044
was locked tight.

01:15:45.879 --> 01:15:47.756
Do you remember
how the detective figured out

01:15:47.797 --> 01:15:49.591
who the real killer had to be?

01:15:49.632 --> 01:15:50.633
He realized the janitor
was only the one

01:15:50.675 --> 01:15:51.718
with the keys to that floor.

01:15:51.760 --> 01:15:52.719
Exactly.

01:15:52.761 --> 01:15:54.596
The one with the keys did it,

01:15:54.637 --> 01:15:56.056
or in this case,

01:15:56.097 --> 01:15:59.184
the one
with the combinations did it.

01:15:59.225 --> 01:16:02.687
Arthur, I don't think
Carson killed Brody Kresser.

01:16:02.729 --> 01:16:05.106
So it was Matt after all then.

01:16:05.148 --> 01:16:07.859
Maybe, but I don't know,
it doesn't feel right.

01:16:07.901 --> 01:16:08.777
It seems like
we're missing something.

01:16:10.070 --> 01:16:15.533
Well, if it wasn't Matt,
Carson or Dawn,

01:16:15.575 --> 01:16:18.495
who killed Brody Kresser?

01:16:18.536 --> 01:16:20.121
[Cook] Smith!

01:16:20.163 --> 01:16:22.123
Get over here.

01:16:34.719 --> 01:16:36.054
[***]

01:16:36.096 --> 01:16:37.555
[Arthur's voice echoing]
Who killed Brody Kresser?

01:16:39.265 --> 01:16:40.642
[Roe's voice echoing]
I don't know,

01:16:40.684 --> 01:16:41.810
it doesn't feel right.

01:16:41.851 --> 01:16:43.478
It seems like
we're missing something.

01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:44.229
[Prof. Lindo's voice echoing]
Tell me the Eighth Principle

01:16:44.270 --> 01:16:45.438
of Information Science.

01:16:45.480 --> 01:16:47.440
[Roe] No information
stands alone.

01:16:47.482 --> 01:16:51.861
All information exists
in the context of...

01:16:54.406 --> 01:16:57.409
...existing relationships.

01:17:06.042 --> 01:17:07.085
Kara!

01:17:07.127 --> 01:17:09.170
Kara, what are you doing?

01:17:09.212 --> 01:17:10.547
Matt told the police
it was Carson,

01:17:10.588 --> 01:17:12.674
and Carson's going to tell
the police it was Matt.

01:17:12.716 --> 01:17:13.508
It was not Matt.

01:17:13.550 --> 01:17:14.634
No, it wasn't.

01:17:14.676 --> 01:17:16.469
It was you.

01:17:17.387 --> 01:17:18.513
The night of the party,

01:17:18.555 --> 01:17:20.348
you were concerned about Matt.

01:17:20.390 --> 01:17:22.017
You went to his condo
to wait for him to come home,

01:17:22.058 --> 01:17:23.184
but he didn't.

01:17:23.226 --> 01:17:25.562
Instead,
an angry Brody Kresser did,

01:17:25.603 --> 01:17:26.896
and he found you,

01:17:26.938 --> 01:17:28.648
Matt's protective older sister,

01:17:28.690 --> 01:17:30.191
and the only other person
in the world

01:17:30.233 --> 01:17:31.776
who knows the names
of the childhood pets

01:17:31.818 --> 01:17:33.111
that Matt uses
to reset the combination lock

01:17:33.153 --> 01:17:34.154
on his door.

01:17:34.195 --> 01:17:35.947
Kara, look around.

01:17:35.989 --> 01:17:37.991
You can't run from this.

01:17:40.535 --> 01:17:43.038
He was threatening
to ruin Matt's life.

01:17:43.079 --> 01:17:44.622
So you hit him on the head
with a vase,

01:17:44.664 --> 01:17:45.915
but it didn't knock him out,
did it?

01:17:47.167 --> 01:17:49.210
He chased you onto the balcony,

01:17:49.252 --> 01:17:51.671
and somehow, you managed
to push him over the edge.

01:17:51.713 --> 01:17:54.215
You picked up the pieces
and locked the door behind you.

01:17:54.257 --> 01:17:56.259
My mom made me swear
on her deathbed

01:17:56.301 --> 01:17:57.761
that I would protect
my little brother,

01:17:57.802 --> 01:17:59.471
and that is the only reason
that I did this.

01:17:59.512 --> 01:18:03.141
How was letting suspicion
fall on Matt protecting him?

01:18:03.183 --> 01:18:04.476
I would never
have let him be arrested.

01:18:04.517 --> 01:18:05.685
There was just
so little evidence,

01:18:05.727 --> 01:18:07.395
I thought this would all
blow over, and...

01:18:10.398 --> 01:18:11.775
I thought he'd marry Sally,

01:18:11.816 --> 01:18:13.568
and then... [crying]

01:18:13.610 --> 01:18:16.571
he'd finally get the family
that he deserved.

01:18:16.613 --> 01:18:18.198
She's gonna leave him
after all this.

01:18:18.239 --> 01:18:19.407
It's all ruined.

01:18:19.449 --> 01:18:21.409
I ruined everything.

01:18:46.643 --> 01:18:49.521
Hey...

01:18:51.815 --> 01:18:53.024
Would you think I'm crazy

01:18:53.066 --> 01:18:54.734
if I said I still
wanted to get married today?

01:18:54.776 --> 01:18:55.902
[chuckling]

01:18:55.944 --> 01:18:57.445
I still have the tux.

01:18:58.738 --> 01:19:03.076
Look, whatever
Carson told you I did,

01:19:03.118 --> 01:19:04.369
it was all him.

01:19:04.411 --> 01:19:07.205
I didn't do anything wrong,

01:19:07.247 --> 01:19:09.207
except stay quiet.

01:19:09.249 --> 01:19:10.458
[sighs]

01:19:10.500 --> 01:19:12.711
But I am not that man anymore.

01:19:12.752 --> 01:19:14.295
You...

01:19:14.337 --> 01:19:17.132
you made me a better person.

01:19:17.173 --> 01:19:19.300
So please, just...

01:19:19.342 --> 01:19:21.344
just give me one more chance.

01:19:25.140 --> 01:19:28.018
Matt...

01:19:28.059 --> 01:19:29.602
my faith in you
stretched farther

01:19:29.644 --> 01:19:33.606
than I ever could've imagined,

01:19:33.648 --> 01:19:35.525
but...

01:19:35.567 --> 01:19:38.445
it won't stretch any more.

01:19:44.868 --> 01:19:45.702
I'm sorry.

01:19:48.079 --> 01:19:49.497
[police officer] Well, I guess
take her into custody

01:19:49.539 --> 01:19:51.041
and then we'll see what happens.

01:19:52.876 --> 01:19:54.627
I'm going to have to take her
to the station.

01:20:01.384 --> 01:20:02.886
What's going on?

01:20:04.346 --> 01:20:07.015
I'm sorry.

01:20:07.057 --> 01:20:08.016
It was Kara.

01:20:09.976 --> 01:20:11.061
[Matt calling] Kara!

01:20:11.102 --> 01:20:12.437
No.

01:20:20.987 --> 01:20:22.197
[chuckling ruefully]

01:20:22.238 --> 01:20:23.740
I'm not getting married
today, Roe.

01:20:23.782 --> 01:20:25.575
I know.

01:20:28.912 --> 01:20:30.830
But hey,

01:20:30.872 --> 01:20:33.291
you won't have a sister-in-law
who's a murderer.

01:20:33.333 --> 01:20:34.376
Too soon?

01:20:34.417 --> 01:20:35.418
Okay, sorry.

01:20:35.460 --> 01:20:36.544

Ta-dah!

01:20:41.383 --> 01:20:42.801
My thesis topic.

01:20:42.842 --> 01:20:44.010
Hmm...

01:20:44.052 --> 01:20:46.304
"How the Knowledge
of True-crime Literature

01:20:46.346 --> 01:20:48.390
Can Help Law Enforcement

01:20:48.431 --> 01:20:50.225
Huh, okay.

01:20:50.266 --> 01:20:51.893
Well, you got my attention.

01:20:51.935 --> 01:20:53.144
Now come sit down

01:20:53.186 --> 01:20:54.437
and take me through
your approach.

01:20:54.479 --> 01:20:55.689
Okay, so here's
what I'm thinking...

01:20:59.651 --> 01:21:01.569
I'm glad you learned to listen
to your instincts, Sally.

01:21:01.611 --> 01:21:03.488
Better a bad announcement,
than a bad marriage.

01:21:03.530 --> 01:21:04.989
Thank you, Aida.

01:21:05.031 --> 01:21:06.408
I'm going to go call

01:21:06.449 --> 01:21:08.201
a potential
new real-estate client,

01:21:08.243 --> 01:21:09.411
see if
she'll list her house with me.

01:21:09.452 --> 01:21:12.205
I've heard
she's very particular.

01:21:12.247 --> 01:21:14.833
Then you will be
her ideal agent, Mother.

01:21:14.874 --> 01:21:16.501
Aw...

01:21:16.543 --> 01:21:18.169
How lucky am I to have
such a cheerleader?

01:21:18.211 --> 01:21:19.462
You are.

01:21:21.381 --> 01:21:22.132
-Bye-bye.
-Bye.

01:21:26.261 --> 01:21:29.222
Daniel said he made this
special for you.

01:21:29.264 --> 01:21:31.099
That will go a long way

01:21:31.141 --> 01:21:32.892
in curing what ails me,

01:21:32.934 --> 01:21:36.062
and so will never, ever
mentioning Matt's name again.

01:21:37.647 --> 01:21:39.441
I cannot believe
I was hours away

01:21:39.482 --> 01:21:41.776
from marrying a criminal.

01:21:41.818 --> 01:21:43.653
Promise me it will never, ever,
ever come up.

01:21:43.695 --> 01:21:44.612
Promise.

01:21:46.281 --> 01:21:47.073
I promise.

01:21:48.158 --> 01:21:49.117
You promise.

01:21:49.159 --> 01:21:50.035
Oh, be right back.

01:21:50.076 --> 01:21:51.119
Hey.

01:21:51.161 --> 01:21:52.120
-Hey.
-Arthur.

01:21:52.162 --> 01:21:53.455
Any news?

01:21:53.496 --> 01:21:55.331
Well, charges have been filed
against Kara

01:21:55.373 --> 01:21:56.958
for the murder of Brody Kresser,

01:21:57.000 --> 01:21:59.711
and both Matt and Carson
have agreed to plead guilty

01:21:59.753 --> 01:22:01.713
to conspiracy
to murder his father.

01:22:01.755 --> 01:22:02.964
Thought I'd let Sally know.

01:22:03.006 --> 01:22:05.175
Ooh, um,

01:22:05.216 --> 01:22:07.218
she actually
just made me promise

01:22:07.260 --> 01:22:10.347
that we would never bring up
Matt's name, like, ever again,

01:22:10.388 --> 01:22:12.182
so maybe
she doesn't want to know.

01:22:12.223 --> 01:22:13.600
Yeah, fair.

01:22:13.641 --> 01:22:14.601
Oh, I almost forgot.

01:22:21.316 --> 01:22:23.151
Thank you for the loan.

01:22:23.193 --> 01:22:24.778
Of course.

01:22:25.862 --> 01:22:27.405
So...

01:22:27.447 --> 01:22:29.532
you and the cook,

01:22:29.574 --> 01:22:30.575
you guys, uh...

01:22:30.617 --> 01:22:32.911
dating, or...?

01:22:32.952 --> 01:22:35.538
I mean, I wouldn't say
we're dating.

01:22:35.580 --> 01:22:37.207
I mean, we're going
on a date tonight.

01:22:37.248 --> 01:22:39.501
Although, um...

01:22:39.542 --> 01:22:43.546
he has this crazy idea
that you want to date me?

01:22:45.799 --> 01:22:47.676
Oh, uh...

01:22:47.717 --> 01:22:49.636
I mean, for as long
as we've been friends?

01:22:49.678 --> 01:22:51.429
How weird would that be?

01:22:51.471 --> 01:22:53.765
[laughing awkwardly]
Yeah, so weird.

01:22:53.807 --> 01:22:54.724
Yeah...

01:22:54.766 --> 01:22:56.685
Yeah.

01:22:58.478 --> 01:23:00.897
Anyways, I should, uh,
say a quick hi to Sally.

01:23:11.908 --> 01:23:13.660
Ah, I think I'm okay...

01:23:13.702 --> 01:23:15.078
All right, scoot in.

01:23:15.120 --> 01:23:17.497
It's my break,
and I always read on my break--

01:23:17.539 --> 01:23:18.540
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

01:23:18.581 --> 01:23:20.625
-We said no more true crime!
-What!

01:23:20.667 --> 01:23:21.543
I did not agree to that.

01:23:21.584 --> 01:23:22.544
What's this one about?

01:23:22.585 --> 01:23:23.837
After everything
that's happened?

01:23:23.878 --> 01:23:24.754
Oh, it's so good, Arthur,
you're going to love it.

01:23:24.796 --> 01:23:26.548
Okay, so this woman,

01:23:26.589 --> 01:23:28.216
she goes missing
in Portland, Oregon,

01:23:28.258 --> 01:23:30.885
she's found in Washington State
a month later.

01:23:30.927 --> 01:23:32.512
It's this crazy journey
of how she got there...

01:23:32.554 --> 01:23:34.097
[***]

01:23:38.226 --> 01:23:42.105
[***]
