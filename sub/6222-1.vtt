and a time of magic,

00:05.131 --> 00:09.886

going after them?

You are such a girl's petticoat.

00:55.640 --> 00:58.517

going to lose in this quest?

00:58.601 --> 00:59.769
As many as it takes.

01:01.437 --> 01:05.191
-I need to speak to you as a friend.
- I have no time for friends.

Yes. It's not as fat as yours.

-It's idiomatic.

01:44.438 --> 01:45.481
It's what?

01:45.564 --> 01:47.817
You need to be more in touch with
the people.

01:47.900 --> 01:50.361

-Yeah.

06:52.955 --> 06:54.540
No, she doesn't. No one does.

06:54.623 --> 06:56.917
Good. Because if Uther finds out...

06:57.001 --> 06:58.836
She knows I tried to poison her.
She knows that.

06:58.919 --> 07:02.172
You had no choice. Camelot was dying.

07:03.007 --> 07:05.134
Morgana was the source
of the enchantment.

07:05.217 --> 07:07.344
Either you poisoned her
or the kingdom fell.

07:07.428 --> 07:09.680
But Uther won't know that.
All she'll say is I tried to kill her.

We can't be sure, Merlin.

24:22.045 --> 24:23.171
I'll prepare myself for bed.

24:23.546 --> 24:25.840
-Are you sure?
-That will be all, Gwen.

25:11.886 --> 25:14.055
To what do I owe this pleasure?

25:14.389 --> 25:16.766
If you will not leave your castle
then I must come to you.

25:16.849 --> 25:19.769
(SMIRKS) I see that you've lost
none of your audacity.

25:20.687 --> 25:21.938
| wish I could say the same.

25:22.814 --> 25:26.150
But I find the great King Cenred

25:26.234 --> 25:29.278
cowering in his chambers when he
should have met me at the border.

25:32.782 --> 25:35.034
Perhaps he has lost his nerve.

25:35.952 --> 25:37.787
Perhaps he is a coward.

25:49.632 --> 25:52.051
You are very beautiful
when you're angry.

25:52.260 --> 25:54.095
Is that why you continue to defy me?

25:54.429 --> 25:56.472
You wouldn't like it
if I made it easy for you.

25:57.473 --> 25:58.975
(CHUCKLES)

26:05.857 --> 26:08.818
I'm certain you've not come all
this way just to drink, Morgause.

26:08.901 --> 26:11.738
-You know me well.
-Extremely well.

26:12.113 --> 26:14.490
And yet somehow we're still close.

26:16.200 --> 26:18.619
I've come to talk to you about
our old friend.

26:18.995 --> 26:20.204
Uther Pendragon.

26:20.288 --> 26:22.665
Yes, I've heard the sad news.

26:23.332 --> 26:24.876
He's finally lost his mind.

26:24.959 --> 26:28.254
Camelot is weak.
Weaker than it's been for years.

26:28.337 --> 26:30.673
The kingdom is vulnerable,
just as I promised.

26:31.007 --> 26:34.302
Yet it doesn't change the fact
the citadel is still impregnable.

26:35.845 --> 26:40.516
So, even without his wits,
Uther is too strong for you.

26:42.310 --> 26:44.228
You're a woman of great courage,
Morgause,

26:44.312 --> 26:46.314
but I don't think with my sword.

26:47.398 --> 26:50.151
An assault on Camelot
cannot be undertaken lightly.

26:50.526 --> 26:54.113
You forget,
we have an ally in the court.

26:54.197 --> 26:56.032
That is no guarantee.

26:58.284 --> 26:59.827
Traitors blow like the wind.

26:59.911 --> 27:01.370
Not this one.

27:01.871 --> 27:05.583
She can be relied upon until the end.
You can be certain of that.

27:10.838 --> 27:12.006
ARTHUR: We've had reports that

27:12.089 --> 27:13.800
mercenaries are streaming
into Cenred's kingdom.

27:14.467 --> 27:15.635
Do we know why?

27:15.885 --> 27:17.929
There is rumor that Cenred is amassing
an army.

27:18.012 --> 27:21.057
| think we should send a patrol
out to assess the situation.

27:26.145 --> 27:27.355
Father?

27:53.172 --> 27:54.715
Leave me alone.

27:59.929 --> 28:01.055
Get out of here.

28:15.778 --> 28:17.655
-Father, we...
- Isaid get out!

28:19.615 --> 28:20.867
Get out!

28:21.200 --> 28:22.577
I'll have you hanged!

28:22.660 --> 28:26.956
You... You... You...

28:30.167 --> 28:32.795
(GRUNTING)

28:37.758 --> 28:39.719
There must be some explanation.

28:41.804 --> 28:46.642
During the Great Purge, Uther drowned
many he suspected of sorcery.

28:47.810 --> 28:50.313
And some, God help them, were children.

28:51.397 --> 28:53.816
Killed for the magic
they were born with.

28:56.652 --> 28:59.363
Maybe his conscience
is playing tricks with him.

28:59.822 --> 29:03.659
Whatever it is,
we can no longer hide this.

29:05.328 --> 29:08.497
A king's hold on his people's
a very fragile thing, Merlin.

29:10.666 --> 29:12.501
If they start to lose faith in him,

29:15.296 --> 29:16.839
| fear for Camelot.

29:18.090 --> 29:21.552
(CHURCH BELLS RINGING)

29:25.222 --> 29:27.016
GAIUS: Take this man to my chambers.

29:27.099 --> 29:29.268
| need to speak to Arthur
as a matter of urgency.

29:32.647 --> 29:35.608
The sentry must have been attacked
at some point during the night.

29:35.691 --> 29:39.528
-Who could've done this?
-That is the sigil of the Bloodguard.

29:41.948 --> 29:43.282
The Bloodguard?

29:43.366 --> 29:47.411
Warrior priests sworn to protect the
High Priestesses of the Old Religion.

29:47.495 --> 29:49.330
Surely they were wiped out
during the Great Purge?

29:49.413 --> 29:50.539
Not all of them.

29:51.457 --> 29:53.376
So you believe there's a traitor
in Camelot?

29:53.751 --> 29:55.294
It is possible, sire.

29:56.045 --> 29:58.130
The sentry will be able to tell us
soon enough.

29:58.464 --> 30:00.174
-He's still alive?
-Indeed.

30:13.896 --> 30:15.064
Gaius?

30:18.901 --> 30:20.236
Merlin?

31:17.043 --> 31:18.210
Gaius.

31:33.851 --> 31:35.728
You said he was recovering.

31:35.811 --> 31:37.938
-I thought he was.
-Then what happened?

31:40.691 --> 31:41.859
You don't think it's strange?

31:44.028 --> 31:45.154
Very.

31:47.031 --> 31:49.992
(THUNDER RUMBLING)

34:22.143 --> 34:25.272
Sorry you had to wait.
There was much to discuss.

34:25.356 --> 34:26.774
But your visit was successful?

34:26.857 --> 34:29.235
Cenred's army ride for Camelot
on my command.

34:29.777 --> 34:31.152
There is nothing you cannot do.

34:32.154 --> 34:34.281
It is you that gives me
strength, sister.

34:35.491 --> 34:37.576
How goes the battle for Uther's mind?

34:37.659 --> 34:42.498
When Cenred marches on Camelot,
he will find a kingdom without a leader.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.632
Then finally we are ready.

34:54.677 --> 34:56.011
Not quite.

34:57.805 --> 34:59.515
Merlin suspects me.

35:01.267 --> 35:02.268
Has he told Arthur?

35:02.518 --> 35:05.938
-Not yet, but he will.
-Well, then we must stop him.

35:07.189 --> 35:09.942
-That will not be difficult.
-Why?

35:11.485 --> 35:12.861
Because he's already here.

35:20.369 --> 35:22.788
Did you really think I was
that stupid, Merlin?

35:46.228 --> 35:47.563
How are you, sire?

35:47.646 --> 35:49.565
It's not me who's sick.

35:50.357 --> 35:52.651
It can't be easy to see your
father this way.

35:53.360 --> 35:54.403
No.

35:57.948 --> 35:59.408
He's always been so strong.

36:01.493 --> 36:03.412
He lifted this kingdom
from its knees, Gaius.

36:05.456 --> 36:07.082
To see him now...

36:08.584 --> 36:11.420
I'm sure that, over time,
he will recover.

36:14.548 --> 36:17.092
But until then, we have
to make plans, Arthur.

36:18.927 --> 36:21.180
We need you to assume control.

36:23.974 --> 36:26.352
-That's ridiculous.
-Camelot needs a leader.

36:27.269 --> 36:29.021
It falls to you.

36:29.104 --> 36:31.690
You must fulfill your role as regent.

36:32.483 --> 36:36.320
This is not just me talking.
Members of the court have spoken.

36:40.491 --> 36:42.659
So now you've taken to
whispering behind my back?

36:43.494 --> 36:46.121
-What kind of treason is this?
-It is for the good of the kingdom.

36:46.789 --> 36:48.874
I'm not going to usurp my father.

36:49.541 --> 36:52.544
The palace is awash with rumors.
The people are restless.

36:54.046 --> 36:56.924

body it is my duty to uphold that.

37:01.220 --> 37:02.346
Arthur, please.

37:02.429 --> 37:06.100
You're giving up on my father.
That is something I will never do.

37:22.658 --> 37:24.618
You intrigue me, Merlin.

37:25.619 --> 37:27.746
Why does a lowly servant continue

37:27.830 --> 37:30.207
to risk everything for Arthur
and for Camelot?

37:35.379 --> 37:37.506

but you're not telling me. Why?

37:41.176 --> 37:44.638
Come on, time and again
you put your life on the line.

37:47.182 --> 37:48.350
There must be a reason.

37:50.269 --> 37:52.771
| believe in a fair and just land.

37:52.855 --> 37:54.273
And you think Arthur will give you that?

37:54.523 --> 37:55.816
| know it.

37:57.359 --> 38:01.864
And then what? You think you'll be
recognized, Merlin? Is that it?

38:02.823 --> 38:05.659
All this so one day you can
be a serving boy to the king?

38:08.996 --> 38:12.374
No, there's something more.

38:14.835 --> 38:16.462
Something you're not telling me,
isn't there?

38:19.756 --> 38:20.883
