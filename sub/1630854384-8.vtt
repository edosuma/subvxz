07:26.717 --> 07:29.019
No no, you have your breakfast,
you know you're not leaving here

07:29.019 --> 07:30.855

you.

07:37.762 --> 07:39.029
What did the doctor say?

07:39.029 --> 07:42.199
Can I just go
for a couple hours?

07:42.199 --> 07:44.101
-Thirty minutes.
-[Karen] A hour.

07:44.902 --> 07:47.138
-Thirty minutes.
-Forty-five minutes.

-You wanna compromise?
-[Karen] Yeah.

07:51.575 --> 07:52.643
Twenty-five minutes.

07:53.210 --> 07:54.712

stop there, okay? Stop.

08:01.752 --> 08:03.454
Alright, so, eat.

08:03.788 --> 08:05.222
Okay.

08:06.724 --> 08:08.926
So...

08:09.627 --> 08:10.561
Yes mama?

08:11.796 --> 08:14.799
Um, you know what?
Never, nevermind.

08:15.266 --> 08:18.836
-Okay.
-Well there was this one thing

08:18.836 --> 08:22.440
-that Fatima brought up.
-[Karen] Oh, okay.

08:22.440 --> 08:24.975
It had to do with if you know
that thirteen days

08:25.476 --> 08:28.312
or eleven days before
and then you, you step back

08:28.312 --> 08:32.082
and then that there's--
and the ultrasound, you know,

08:32.082 --> 08:34.084
I don't know,
maybe she's onto something.

08:35.085 --> 08:36.720
-About?
-It was about

08:36.720 --> 08:41.692
whether or not you could tell
when you actually conceived.

08:42.593 --> 08:46.964
-Oh, yeah.
-[Lisa] So you know about this?

08:46.964 --> 08:51.702
-Yeah, I read about it.
-And?

08:52.002 --> 08:54.638
-And, I did it.
-When?

08:54.872 --> 08:57.041
When I first found out mama.

08:57.508 --> 08:59.143
It's the first thing
I looked up.

08:59.510 --> 09:02.713
It's another reason I know
it's Zac's baby.

09:03.247 --> 09:04.381
Well did you check with the
doctor,

09:04.381 --> 09:06.684
I mean between the ultrasound
and all--

09:06.684 --> 09:10.821
No mama, I know, okay?
-[Lisa] Well how do you know?

09:10.821 --> 09:12.790
I do, so I didn't check.

09:13.424 --> 09:15.426
And you don't wanna check with
the doctor?

09:15.426 --> 09:17.094
-[Karen] No.
-Well don't you think maybe

09:17.094 --> 09:18.229
you should check with the
doctor?

09:18.229 --> 09:19.597
I mean, the guys don't know
and--

09:19.597 --> 09:22.833
Okay mama can I eat the food
that you asked me to eat

09:22.833 --> 09:24.435
and then go to the salon?

09:24.835 --> 09:26.804
-Okay.
-For 29 minutes, 25,

09:26.804 --> 09:28.038
whatever you said.

09:28.939 --> 09:30.674
And then we'll go
to the doctor after?

09:30.674 --> 09:35.012
-Okay, [laughs] really?
-Alright, fine.

09:35.012 --> 09:36.814
-Please.
-Fine, fine, fine, fine.

09:36.814 --> 09:37.982
It's a beautiful day.

09:38.949 --> 09:41.719
I'll just call the doctor later
myself.

09:49.285 --> 09:55.091

and you got right back in it

10:07.070 --> 10:09.138

out of the bathroom?

10:09.439 --> 10:13.876
Yeah, uh...
Where you going?

10:14.410 --> 10:17.680
I told you I had to get up early
and leave this morning.

10:17.680 --> 10:22.819
-Come on, that's not fair.
-[Andi] I have to go.

10:23.152 --> 10:26.189
Okay, where are you going?

10:26.189 --> 10:28.624
I have to help a friend.

10:30.026 --> 10:34.030
-Oh, okay, cool.
-So um...

10:35.465 --> 10:40.269
You know you could, you
could, you can leave with me.

10:41.137 --> 10:43.306
-Wait what?
-[Andi] Yeah.

10:43.940 --> 10:46.042
-Andi.
-What?

10:46.876 --> 10:48.311
We used to live together.

10:48.845 --> 10:53.483
Well used to is the operative
phrase, right?

10:53.483 --> 10:56.919
-Are you serious right now?
-Yeah.

10:57.520 --> 11:00.590
-You want me to leave?
-Yes.

11:00.590 --> 11:02.291
You want me to leave the house
that I bought?

11:02.291 --> 11:04.460
-Wait don't--
-For you, because you thought

11:04.460 --> 11:09.499
that I was gonna say that I
bought but then I said for you.

11:09.499 --> 11:15.405
-For, okay, watch it, that was
close, you saved yourself.

11:15.405 --> 11:18.941
[laughs] Yes, I would like you
to leave the house

11:18.941 --> 11:23.079
that you bought for me,
my house.

11:23.079 --> 11:25.648
-Is there something you're
trying to hide?

11:29.085 --> 11:33.990
And if I was? [laughs]

11:33.990 --> 11:36.993
-Okay, we've been over it.
-[Andi] We have been over that.

11:36.993 --> 11:42.398
-I'm gonna let it go.
-Oh, growth, looks good on you.

11:42.765 --> 11:46.836
-Okay, so uh...

11:46.836 --> 11:50.506
Just gonna go to the bathroom.

11:51.340 --> 11:55.445
-To put on the same clothes?
-Well you know,

11:55.445 --> 11:58.414
it'd be a lot easier if I could
leave some stuff here.

11:58.414 --> 12:03.653
[laughs] No, no, no, no, no no
no no.

12:03.653 --> 12:04.654
Why not?

12:05.288 --> 12:08.558
Because that's how it starts and
we're not together.

12:09.325 --> 12:10.526
Then what are we doing?

12:11.294 --> 12:13.329
Well I'm just, you know,

12:13.763 --> 12:17.300
taking it slow and seeing
where you are with all of this.

12:18.568 --> 12:21.838
-I told you I'm better.
-[Andi] You did.

12:22.205 --> 12:23.573
Am I not?

12:24.907 --> 12:26.676
You are trying, yeah.

12:28.010 --> 12:31.714
-Thank you.
-You've tried before.

12:31.714 --> 12:32.982
-I'm sorry?
-Hmmm?

12:33.349 --> 12:36.752
Can I get like a little bit of
credit, like?

12:37.320 --> 12:39.589
Yes, you get a
little bit of credit

12:39.589 --> 12:41.924
but that's why we spent
the night together.

12:42.658 --> 12:46.162
-It was nice.
-So I'll go shower then.

12:46.162 --> 12:48.231
-Quickly!
-Why are you rushing me?

12:48.231 --> 12:51.000
Because I have to go,
I have things to do!

12:51.400 --> 12:52.635
put your clothes on.

12:59.509 --> 13:03.346
Andi, you know, while you're in
a rush like this--

13:03.346 --> 13:05.581
-[Andi] Uh-huh.
-I could stay and lock up.

13:05.581 --> 13:08.784
No, I don't need you to stay and

13:08.784 --> 13:12.522
with me, expeditiously.
-Oh my god.

13:13.489 --> 13:16.325
You don't have to cover up
around me, you shy now?

13:16.926 --> 13:20.196
[laughs] Uh-huh.

13:20.196 --> 13:23.232
Oh, good morning kisses.

13:24.667 --> 13:27.770
No, get out of here!
-No, no!

13:27.770 --> 13:31.574
-[laughs]
-Love you.

13:31.874 --> 13:34.377
Love you too.

13:34.377 --> 13:37.947
Hurry up, geez.

13:39.649 --> 13:41.817
I'm gonna check some messages.

13:48.791 --> 13:53.095
Hi, this is Andi Barns and I was
wondering if you could help me?

13:53.729 --> 13:55.932
Marilyn told me to give you
a call,

13:56.799 --> 14:00.436
so Judge Ross, if you could
please call me back

14:01.003 --> 14:02.371
I would greatly appreciate it.

14:02.371 --> 14:04.974
I also sent you a text message
with all my information.

14:05.908 --> 14:09.245
I have a friend in jail and I
could really use some help.

14:10.012 --> 14:11.847
Thank you, in advance.

14:14.617 --> 14:15.551
Okay.

14:20.523 --> 14:23.426

hear from Judge Ross

14:24.160 --> 14:26.929

-Still mad?
-No.

16:39.128 --> 16:42.998
Let me guess,
you meditated and you prayed.

16:42.998 --> 16:45.134
Mm-hmm, and I am centered
for the day.

16:45.568 --> 16:49.672
-Right.
-What is it Zac?

16:50.740 --> 16:53.843
Come on 'Tima, you don't wanna
talk about Karen?

16:54.510 --> 16:57.880
-No, I don't.
-So can we talk about me?

16:59.682 --> 17:02.852
No, I don't wanna look into
those puppy dog eyes of yours.

17:03.719 --> 17:06.789
What you talkin' bout?
These is tiger eyes, look.

17:07.590 --> 17:11.293
Yeah, it's very much giving
crazy eye and no, no,

17:11.293 --> 17:12.461
it's not working for me.

17:12.461 --> 17:14.864
-Come on, Fatima.
-Zac I don't, okay?

17:15.865 --> 17:17.600
You're telling me you don't
wanna look into my eyes?

17:18.167 --> 17:19.869
No, I don't.

17:21.971 --> 17:22.938
Alright.

17:23.606 --> 17:25.674
-Alright, I gotta go.
-So you gonna leave me here

17:25.674 --> 17:26.942
with all this breakfast?

17:27.610 --> 17:29.745
Well maybe you can feed it to
your tenant

17:29.745 --> 17:32.014
since you like to let in strays.

17:33.015 --> 17:34.083
We gotta go there?

17:34.083 --> 17:37.686
I'm going so I don't kill
anybody, okay?

17:37.686 --> 17:40.856
Right, with you
and your gangster cousin?

17:41.223 --> 17:45.161
That's right, yeah, okay.

17:46.529 --> 17:48.130
Come on, man.

17:49.565 --> 17:51.033
What Zac?

17:51.700 --> 17:54.770
-You don't wanna talk to me?
-No, I don't.

17:54.770 --> 17:56.338
Stop running!
Like you just running

17:56.338 --> 17:57.840
from everything all the time.

17:57.840 --> 18:00.142
-I'm not running.
-Yes you are, you always run.

18:00.876 --> 18:03.445
-I wanna talk.
-Okay, you wanna talk?

18:03.445 --> 18:04.814
-Yes.
-Talk.

18:05.948 --> 18:09.118
Don't start the conversation
with a attitude.

18:12.188 --> 18:14.890
-Talk.
-Better.

18:16.058 --> 18:20.629
Look, I thought about everything
Karen said last night and

18:21.730 --> 18:23.999
I know it makes me
look like a asshole.

18:24.600 --> 18:28.637
-But you're not.
-Thank you for saying that.

18:29.605 --> 18:32.141
But I, I just want you to be
comfortable.

18:33.108 --> 18:35.945
-Zac, I am comfortable.
-Even more comfortable.

18:37.046 --> 18:39.515
-Okay.
-So I was thinking like

18:40.583 --> 18:42.284
let me take you out
on a date tonight.

18:43.452 --> 18:47.423
-Why?
-What you mean, why?

18:48.190 --> 18:50.259
I just feel like you trying to
make up for something.

18:50.259 --> 18:52.494
I'm your man, I can't just take
you out on a date,

18:52.494 --> 18:53.829
what I got to make up for?

18:54.830 --> 18:56.432
Okay well if you don't know
then we have--

18:56.432 --> 19:02.471
Okay, okay, okay, okay, alright
alright, okay, my bad, okay?

19:02.905 --> 19:07.543
I just, gosh, look I just want
you to be comfortable, okay?

19:07.543 --> 19:08.477
That's it.

19:09.578 --> 19:13.816
So I want to take you on a date
and I want to ask you something.

19:14.617 --> 19:16.385
-What do you wanna ask me?
-Can you just let me

19:16.385 --> 19:17.887
take you on a date?

19:17.887 --> 19:20.189
-What do you want to ask me?
-Oh so now you wanna talk.

19:20.189 --> 19:22.725
Two minutes ago you was like I

19:22.725 --> 19:24.093
-but now you all--
-I still gotta go,

19:24.093 --> 19:26.462
-but I wanna know.
-So how about you just wait

19:26.462 --> 19:28.330
and tonight you get dressed up
in that thing that I like

19:28.330 --> 19:32.034
and let me take you out?
Oh I see a smirk, oh!

19:32.301 --> 19:34.136
-Come on.
-Alright.

19:34.737 --> 19:36.605
Alright, I'll wait 'til tonight.

19:36.605 --> 19:40.276
-Alright, I love you.
-I love you too.

19:40.276 --> 19:43.946
-Not as much as I love you.
-Yeah, okay.

-Bye.

Yeah.

21:26.582 --> 21:28.017
I think you got that wrong.

21:29.818 --> 21:32.254
Well the IP address was traced
back to you.

21:33.188 --> 21:34.690
-I don't know what you're
talking about.

21:36.325 --> 21:39.061

21:44.833 --> 21:46.001
It's not mine.

21:51.473 --> 21:52.741
This look familiar?

21:59.882 --> 22:02.151
Well this, this isn't--

22:02.151 --> 22:05.487
That was one call to my contact
at the CIA.

22:06.789 --> 22:09.358
I'm very well connected, that
was traced right back to you.

22:10.793 --> 22:12.227
-Well--
-I'm getting really sick

22:12.227 --> 22:15.431
of your bullshit Hayden,
just tell me what your game is.

22:18.600 --> 22:19.835
What do you mean, Robin?

22:21.503 --> 22:25.541
Why did you send me this email
about Andi and the janitor?

22:26.175 --> 22:30.279
Oh, well, I just thought you
should know.

22:32.014 --> 22:33.148
-[Robin] Why is that?

22:34.183 --> 22:36.652
Well you're new here and, you
know,

22:36.652 --> 22:38.087
I didn't want you getting
caught up.

22:42.925 --> 22:46.295
-Is this true?
-[Hayden] Oh, it's true.

22:47.663 --> 22:51.834
-How do you know?
-Trust me, it's true.

22:54.770 --> 22:58.941
If it's not true,
she could sue you.

22:59.675 --> 23:01.110
-[Hayden] Well--
-And the firm.

23:01.110 --> 23:03.045
Well that wasn't my intention.

23:08.584 --> 23:09.852
We done, or?

23:11.954 --> 23:14.089
-You can leave.
-Okay.

23:15.958 --> 23:20.229
Just know... It's your third
strike.

23:20.662 --> 23:23.165
Oh.

23:23.165 --> 23:25.501
You're really starting to make
me wonder why you're here.

23:26.535 --> 23:32.207
Interesting, you've seen my
client list, right?

23:32.207 --> 23:33.142
I have.

23:34.009 --> 23:36.044
-[Hayden] Including the client
you met with yesterday?

23:37.079 --> 23:37.779
Yes.

23:38.680 --> 23:42.184
So you're well aware that I'm
responsible for 34%

23:42.184 --> 23:43.785
of the revenue around here.

23:43.785 --> 23:47.156
-[Robin] Last year,
it was 12 before that.

23:47.156 --> 23:50.292
It don't matter.
Only thing that does matter,

23:51.126 --> 23:55.831
-I'm valuable around here.
-I really hope you think so.

23:55.831 --> 23:57.166
-[Hayden] Oh, I know so.
-Hmmm.

23:57.799 --> 23:59.134
You know so too.

24:02.671 --> 24:04.640
What you need to know

24:04.640 --> 24:07.543
is that everything
loses its value eventually.

24:07.543 --> 24:09.011
-Not everything.
-No?

24:10.145 --> 24:14.283
You do something like this again
your value will not matter,

24:14.283 --> 24:15.984
you will be fired,
am I clear?

24:16.818 --> 24:20.389
Wow, hey, whatever you say
Mr. Boss man.

24:22.524 --> 24:25.027
-Go.
-Gotcha.

[door opens]

24:40.175 --> 24:45.948

24:47.983 --> 24:51.053
-And it gets worse.
-Excuse me?

24:51.053 --> 24:54.523
-Have a good day, Andi.
-I plan on it.

25:13.242 --> 25:16.678
-Hey.
-Good morning, Sir.

25:17.746 --> 25:23.118
-I need to talk to you.
-Oh, is it about business?

25:23.819 --> 25:26.054
-Andi?
-Yes, Sir?

25:27.723 --> 25:32.761
-I need to talk to you.
-Is it regarding business, Sir?

25:32.761 --> 25:33.629
-[Robin] No, it's not.

25:34.863 --> 25:38.433
Well then I don't think we have
anything to say to each other.

25:40.569 --> 25:44.072
Andi, I found out what happened.
Can I tell you--

25:44.072 --> 25:48.677
-Concerning the business?
-Okay.

25:49.044 --> 25:50.379
Have a good day, Sir.

25:55.083 --> 25:57.486
-Good morning.
-Good morning, you look nice.

25:57.486 --> 26:01.023
-Thank you, have your coffee.
-Oh, thank you, oh my gosh.

26:03.959 --> 26:05.427
Okay, alright, thank you.

26:05.427 --> 26:09.231
Um, have you heard from Danni,
has she called?

26:09.598 --> 26:12.267
No, no she hasn't.

26:12.267 --> 26:13.568
I'm trying to get in touch with
her,

26:13.568 --> 26:15.304
um, could you call her
for me please?

26:15.304 --> 26:16.838
-[Fatima] Of course,
yeah I'll call her.

26:16.838 --> 26:19.207
-Okay.
-Um, what was that about?

26:19.875 --> 26:21.610
-[Andi] What?
-Robin.

26:21.610 --> 26:24.780
Oh, girl, nothing I'm gonna
concern myself with.

26:25.580 --> 26:29.518
Okay, you sure you don't wanna
talk to him?

26:31.053 --> 26:33.288
I mean I know, I know what just
happened.

26:33.288 --> 26:36.291
He completely disrespected me,
so yeah he's not someone

26:36.291 --> 26:37.626
I wanna talk to right now.

26:37.993 --> 26:39.661
Okay, alright.

26:40.562 --> 26:43.565
Um, I am ready to have a
productive day, however...

26:45.200 --> 26:48.570
-[Fatima] What?
-The contact your cousin gave me

26:49.071 --> 26:50.372
hasn't called me back yet.

26:51.006 --> 26:53.875
-Wait a minute, what?
-No.

26:53.875 --> 26:57.312
Okay, hold on one second, that
don't even sound right.

26:57.312 --> 27:00.749
No it's, it's fine if she can't
do it, I just, I was--

27:01.083 --> 27:02.351
Andi she definitely can do it,

27:02.351 --> 27:04.686
give me one sec,
I'm shooting this text.

27:06.855 --> 27:07.956
Stay by your phone.

27:08.290 --> 27:09.624
-[Andi] Are you sure she can
help?

27:09.624 --> 27:12.260
-Mm-hmm, absolutely.
-I've been calling the contact

27:12.260 --> 27:14.763
and leaving messages
and getting nothing.

27:15.497 --> 27:21.269
-Just wait for it.
-Okay, I guess I'll wait.

27:21.737 --> 27:22.738
How was your night?

27:23.171 --> 27:27.509
It was, it was good.

27:27.509 --> 27:31.213
I may have
gone over Karen's house.

27:31.213 --> 27:34.649
-You didn't.
-Yeah, I did.

27:35.250 --> 27:38.887
Okay well... Spill the tea,

27:38.887 --> 27:39.821
How was it?

27:40.522 --> 27:42.391

out who the baby daddy is.

28:07.816 --> 28:10.952
You can find out a baby daddy
from an ultrasound?

28:11.286 --> 28:14.556
Look, we gonna see.
[chuckles] I don't know.

28:14.556 --> 28:16.124

What did she say?

28:50.258 --> 28:51.760
She said I could see her.

28:52.360 --> 28:54.796
See, that's how we do business,

29:03.805 --> 29:04.706
That's good.

29:05.707 --> 29:09.678
Oh right, remember we have the
deposition today so if we could

29:10.645 --> 29:12.581
get that done beforehand,
that would be great.

29:12.581 --> 29:14.483
Already on it,

29:30.232 --> 29:31.867

29:32.100 --> 29:33.435
I heard back from the judge

29:33.435 --> 29:34.970
and she said

29:35.537 --> 29:37.305

30:02.998 --> 30:06.568
-What are you talking about?
-Robin just threatened me.

30:07.435 --> 30:08.937
-[Gary]<i> How was that?</i>

30:10.372 --> 30:12.207
He found out
that I sent that email.

30:15.143 --> 30:16.211
How the hell did he do that?

30:16.912 --> 30:19.748
[Hayden]<i> I don't know,
he said he got CIA connections.</i>

30:20.115 --> 30:21.449
No, there's no way.

30:21.449 --> 30:23.251
I mean how else would he figure
this out?

30:23.251 --> 30:25.086
-[Gary]<i> Is this --
connected like that?</i>

30:25.086 --> 30:26.488
I don't know,
that's what he says.

30:27.889 --> 30:29.824
Well you better be careful on
this phone then.

30:30.425 --> 30:31.726
Yeah well I'm on the cellphone.

30:31.726 --> 30:33.428
[Gary]<i> You better be careful

30:39.267 --> 30:40.535

Listen, I just got in, alright,

30:44.105 --> 30:46.841
at the hedge fund and I'll see
what they're saying.

30:46.841 --> 30:48.843
I don't understand why they
can't just get rid of him.

30:48.843 --> 30:50.512
-[Gary] Like I said,
I will talk to them.

30:50.512 --> 30:51.980

-Well come sit down.
-Oh, Pam.

31:51.999 --> 31:55.369
Girl, can you just let me take

32:31.004 --> 32:34.508
-What is she doing?
-Oh god, she won't let me

32:34.508 --> 32:38.045
get out of bed, she won't
let me do nothing for myself.

32:38.045 --> 32:41.448
Girl, wish I could lay in the
bed all day and do nothing.

32:41.949 --> 32:45.385
Pam, we know you don't use no
bed for nothing, okay?

32:45.385 --> 32:47.488
-Oh, don't you say it.
-I'm just sayin'.

32:48.288 --> 32:51.892
You sit at that desk right there
and do nothing all day.

32:51.892 --> 32:55.229
You tried it, as nice as I've
been to you.

32:55.229 --> 32:57.164
-Sorry.
-Okay fine,

32:57.164 --> 32:59.099

You gotta help me get a break,
please!

33:02.169 --> 33:03.604
Now how we supposed to do that?

33:03.604 --> 33:05.506
I don't know Pam, you are very
creative.

33:05.973 --> 33:09.209
Okay, well let me see
what Ms. Pam can do.

33:09.209 --> 33:10.410
Okay, thank you.

-I'm fine, really, I am.
-Okay, Ms. Thing.

33:21.989 --> 33:24.691
I am, as a matter of fact
I think you should

33:24.691 --> 33:26.193
call the doctor, see if I can
get in today

33:26.193 --> 33:28.762
and they can tell my mama I'm
fine and she can go home.

33:29.429 --> 33:30.898
She really is
driving you crazy.

33:30.898 --> 33:33.066
Just do it Pam, please,

I'm so happy you're here.
Nevermind Pam.

33:45.746 --> 33:47.981
-That makes me feel special.
-Nope, we got it.

33:49.082 --> 33:50.684
Hi, hi Pam.

33:51.184 --> 33:53.854
You've literally never hugged me
like that before.

33:53.854 --> 33:56.089
Okay, yeah,

33:56.590 --> 33:58.559
Um, Sabrina couldn't make it

33:59.059 --> 34:01.828
and Danni's
not answering her phone, so.

34:02.195 --> 34:04.631
-She still mad?
-No, she's not, she's not.

34:05.332 --> 34:06.567
Okay.

34:07.467 --> 34:09.469
Um, are you sure you should be
at work today?

34:09.469 --> 34:13.774
-Yeah, can you talk to my mama?
-Karen.

34:13.774 --> 34:15.976
-Please, just talk to my mama,

34:16.843 --> 34:18.612
-Okay, she's not gonna listen to
us, huh?

34:18.979 --> 34:21.782
-That's what I said.
-Okay, I told y'all

34:21.782 --> 34:24.651
I will take a break, okay?
I will, but I can't just

34:24.651 --> 34:27.287
sit in one spot and not do
nothing I can't do it.

34:27.287 --> 34:29.823
Okay, as long as you promise.
- I do, now you tell her that--

34:29.823 --> 34:33.093
-Okay, I will talk to her.
-Okay, Pam, go get her.

34:33.927 --> 34:37.297
Shame on you for trying to get
rid of your own mama.

34:37.297 --> 34:40.367
Go on.
[laughter]

34:40.367 --> 34:43.470

34:43.770 --> 34:46.607
Oh my god, Andi you better be
good.

34:47.341 --> 34:48.542
What is that supposed to mean?

34:48.842 --> 34:50.877
It means I wish
'Brina was here.

34:51.745 --> 34:53.914
Well I'm here, I can do this.

34:53.914 --> 34:56.049
Yes, but 'Brina
knows how to look sad.

34:56.783 --> 35:00.120
-I too, know how to look sad.
-Andi look at you.

35:01.188 --> 35:03.890
Ain't nothing about this dress
screaming, you know, sad.

35:03.890 --> 35:05.225
-That's valid. [laughs]
-You look good, though.

35:05.225 --> 35:06.793

38:46.480 --> 38:48.315
-Danni?
-Yeah, yeah.

38:48.315 --> 38:53.687
-Um, did she ask for me?
-No, she asked for Andi but--

38:54.188 --> 38:55.756
<i>-[Fatima] Okay well tell her
that she's not here.</i>

38:55.756 --> 38:58.225
Yeah, you should probably come
up here.

38:58.659 --> 39:02.296
-Linda, what's going on?
-Yeah, just, you should come up.

39:02.296 --> 39:03.597
Did she ask for me?

39:04.031 --> 39:07.968
Yeah, after I told her Andi
wasn't here, so.

39:09.236 --> 39:11.805
-Okay, um, I'm on my way.
-Alright.

39:11.805 --> 39:12.940
Bye-bye.

39:15.409 --> 39:16.343
Okay.

39:18.345 --> 39:20.147
-She'll be right down.
-Thank you.

39:20.147 --> 39:22.449

39:27.387 --> 39:29.356
-Danni?
-Hi.

39:29.356 --> 39:35.395
-Hey.
-Um, do you know where Andi is?

39:36.029 --> 39:40.267
-Um, she had to step out.
-Okay well I um--

39:41.001 --> 39:45.138
-Danni, are you okay?
-I just need to talk to her--

39:45.138 --> 39:47.241
No, come on, let's not talk up
here, come on.

39:59.019 --> 40:03.023
Have a seat right here.

40:04.358 --> 40:06.693
Do you need anything?

40:06.693 --> 40:08.328
I just need to talk to Andi.

40:11.064 --> 40:12.833
Danni, but are you okay?

40:15.302 --> 40:17.371
-No. [crying]
-Okay, okay, alright, alright

40:17.371 --> 40:21.475
-I'm gonna go call her now.
-Thank you.

40:27.114 --> 40:32.252
Andi, hey, Danni's here.

40:32.252 --> 40:34.855
I'm here too, what's going on?

40:34.855 --> 40:37.224
-She's in your office.
-Why?

40:37.224 --> 40:39.226
I don't--
Andi, it's not good.

40:39.226 --> 40:40.127
What the--

40:44.031 --> 40:46.199
What the hell?
Are you okay?

40:46.199 --> 40:47.834
Can you, can you please
get her some water?

40:47.834 --> 40:49.069
Yes, yes, yes.

40:49.069 --> 40:51.238
Danni, Danni look.
It's gonna be fine.

40:51.605 --> 40:53.206
Listen, I don't want you
stressing about this,

40:53.206 --> 40:55.942
Sabrina is gonna be fine,
we get to see her today.

40:55.942 --> 40:57.377
The judge got back with me,
I've been trying

40:57.377 --> 40:59.279
to get in touch with
you all day, are you okay?

40:59.279 --> 41:00.981
-Andi.
-What, what's wrong?

41:00.981 --> 41:02.115
I need a lawyer.

41:04.885 --> 41:06.153
Why?

41:09.156 --> 41:14.428
I killed him,
I killed someone, so...

41:14.428 --> 41:16.496
I need a lawyer.

41:19.099 --> 41:21.068
Who did you kill?

41:27.083 --> 41:28.551
[Narrator]<i> Next on Sistas.</i>

41:28.551 --> 41:31.454
Once you went outside and ran
him over with your car,

41:31.454 --> 41:33.289
makes things a
little complicated.

41:33.289 --> 41:36.258
-I know Fatima is crazy as hell.
-You know that now.

41:36.258 --> 41:38.260
You need to be careful.

41:38.260 --> 41:39.895
What do I need
to be careful for?

41:39.895 --> 41:42.031
She's cousins with Madam.

41:42.031 --> 41:43.399
Heather, what are you
doing here?

41:43.399 --> 41:45.568
-I came here to see my lawyer.
-What lawyer?

41:45.568 --> 41:47.403
-Why do you need to know?
-What's the passcode?

41:47.403 --> 41:48.804
-9833.
-[Karen] You learn a lot about

41:48.804 --> 41:50.940
a person by going
through their phone.

41:50.940 --> 41:55.177
She's staying here
for a very long time.
