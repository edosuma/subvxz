00:09.718 --> 00:12.846
Help me! I need a doctor!

00:12.846 --> 00:14.348
And I lost my nipple!

00:14.848 --> 00:17.559
- You can't come back here.
- Here! Help me! I saved it!

00:17.559 --> 00:20.229
- Sir, you can't come back here.
- I have it! I--

00:25.442 --> 00:27.319
I need an orderly over here!

00:55.013 --> 00:57.474
What? I'm just taking a nap.

00:58.892 --> 00:59.977
Okay.

01:01.562 --> 01:04.105
What are you looking at?
Get the fuck outta here.

01:07.109 --> 01:08.110
Fuck.

01:12.197 --> 01:13.866
Okay.

02:10.005 --> 02:11.548
As you can see, it's a great neighborhood.

02:11.548 --> 02:13.425
- It's a great park at the market.
- The house has great bones.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.468
It's charming.

02:14.468 --> 02:17.054
- Charming. Really authentic to the desert.
- Yeah.

02:17.054 --> 02:18.222
I really love it.

02:31.902 --> 02:32.903
Come on.

02:35.822 --> 02:36.698
Shit.

02:37.324 --> 02:39.117
I'm sorry, would you excuse me
for a second?

02:39.117 --> 02:40.202
Oh, yeah, sure.

02:41.620 --> 02:43.580
What the hell happened? Are you okay?

02:43.580 --> 02:46.124
What are you doing here?
And who's your spiffy little friend?

02:47.334 --> 02:48.627
What happened to your car?

02:48.627 --> 02:51.839
Hit-and-run.
I'm never going to that Walmart again.

02:51.839 --> 02:54.550
- Were you in it when it happened?
- Course not.

02:54.550 --> 02:57.094
A black box
couldn't have survived that thing.

02:58.345 --> 02:59.638
Who are you?

03:00.264 --> 03:02.099
- Chris Cooly, Gallantry Realty.
- This is Chris.

03:02.099 --> 03:04.810
- How are you?
- This is Chris.

03:04.810 --> 03:06.562
- We're not selling.
- Really?

03:06.562 --> 03:08.564
- Take your comps and go.
- Peg-- You cannot afford the mortgage.

03:08.564 --> 03:11.692
- Let's at least get it appraised.
- Go. Get out! Get out of here!

03:11.692 --> 03:13.402
- Okay.
- Stewart and I will call you.

03:13.402 --> 03:15.237
- Thank you. Nice to meet you.
- We will not call you.

03:15.237 --> 03:18.031
- Don't wait for the call.
- I am so sorry, Chris.

03:18.031 --> 03:19.700
- At the right time.
- Never.

03:19.700 --> 03:20.868
Damn it.

03:20.868 --> 03:22.953
Tell me you at least have insurance.

03:22.953 --> 03:26.415
I have liability only.
They're vultures, these companies.

03:26.415 --> 03:28.584
They charge you a hundred bucks
just to fart in the car.

03:31.295 --> 03:33.839
Are you gonna answer it?
Why do you never answer your phone?

03:33.839 --> 03:36.091
- Telemarketers!
- You're driving me crazy.

03:36.091 --> 03:38.677
Some boiler room
in New Delhi's been trying to get

03:38.677 --> 03:41.763
into my bank account all week.
I'm onto 'em.

03:41.763 --> 03:42.848
Great.

03:50.522 --> 03:52.983
Look at that crema. That's a work of art.

03:53.525 --> 03:55.194
Next time, I'll make you a flower.

03:56.320 --> 03:58.780
Hey, you want some steaks?

03:59.406 --> 04:01.742
No. And why do you have all those steaks?

04:02.659 --> 04:04.161
I know a guy.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.247
Hey...

04:07.247 --> 04:12.377
I need a little down payment for a car
because obviously that thing's unsafe.

04:13.045 --> 04:14.463
And I'm working up a case.

04:14.463 --> 04:15.714
I'll pay you back.

04:15.714 --> 04:18.841
At this point, maybe a chauffeured
limousine would be cheaper.

04:18.841 --> 04:20.302
Is that what Stewart said?

04:20.302 --> 04:21.803
Are you quoting him?

04:21.803 --> 04:23.305
We both say it.

04:25.682 --> 04:29.353
- Dianne, don't be tofu.
- Oh, come on.

04:29.353 --> 04:32.272
Don't take on the season
of whatever's in the pot with you.

04:32.272 --> 04:34.024
I can think for myself, okay?

04:34.024 --> 04:36.777
- This is a gigantic case. Believe me.
- Okay.

04:36.777 --> 04:38.695
Right. This is the "PI thing?"

04:38.695 --> 04:41.323
It's real. It's not an "air quotes thing."

04:41.323 --> 04:44.535
Where do you think I was last night? Huh?

04:45.744 --> 04:50.499
I was working. Big-time stakeout.
You'll read about it soon.

04:51.166 --> 04:53.961
And don't you show this house again
when I'm gone.

04:55.379 --> 04:56.380
All right.

04:56.880 --> 04:58.715
I'll deposit some money for a new car.

04:58.715 --> 04:59.675
Thank you.

04:59.675 --> 05:02.970
But this is a family house, Peggy.
This is my house too.

05:03.720 --> 05:05.180
Of course, honey.

05:09.852 --> 05:11.645
It's like a knife in the back.

05:11.645 --> 05:14.064
I could live in a refrigerator box
for all they care.

05:14.898 --> 05:16.024
I know.

05:16.024 --> 05:18.652
And you know what? Guess what?
The joke's on them.

05:18.652 --> 05:20.529
I'm about to make some serious bank.

05:20.529 --> 05:23.949
<i>Yes, you are. And you know why?
Cooper and I--</i>

05:23.949 --> 05:28.662
Well, mostly Cooper, scoured the Internet
and found some goods on this guru guy.

05:28.662 --> 05:33.584
Fuck him. What did he do?
Is he a felon? A crook? I knew it.

05:33.584 --> 05:36.962
Check this out. His wife went missing.

05:37.546 --> 05:38.672
<i>Wife murderer.</i>

05:41.383 --> 05:42.926
Donatella's dead.

05:42.926 --> 05:44.636
Well, she won't be needing these.

05:44.636 --> 05:47.681
<i>He claimed that she left him
and went to Mexico.</i>

05:47.681 --> 05:49.433
<i>My money's on she's dead.</i>

05:49.433 --> 05:50.434
Never been deader.

05:50.434 --> 05:54.563
Right? And the family never bought it.
There was a $70,000 reward.

05:55.147 --> 05:57.983
Well, there still might be.
We need to find that out.

05:57.983 --> 06:00.986
<i>Oh, shit. We gotta get that money.
That's our money.</i>

06:00.986 --> 06:05.115
Yes! We need that chaos.
We need some noise, Peg.

06:05.115 --> 06:06.992
- I'm your girl.
- Yas!

06:06.992 --> 06:07.910
<i>Excuse me.</i>

06:07.910 --> 06:10.245
How much to put locks on the windows, huh?

06:13.916 --> 06:15.709
<i>Bring awareness to your left foot.</i>

06:16.376 --> 06:20.547
<i>Now starting with the big toe,
breathe into each toe one by one.</i>

06:21.340 --> 06:25.677
<i>As sensation in your toes increases,
you trust that you are safe,</i>

06:25.677 --> 06:28.722
<i>you are good and you are whole.</i>

06:32.100 --> 06:33.185
Fuck.

06:38.732 --> 06:40.651
Hey!

06:40.651 --> 06:44.112
Get that thing out of here.
Go. I have a client coming.

06:44.112 --> 06:47.199
Hey, I wanna talk to you
about this Guru Bob bastard.

06:47.199 --> 06:49.535
Aren't you supposed to be in class?

06:49.535 --> 06:52.621
Yeah, he's starting late today.
It's going great, by the way.

06:52.621 --> 06:54.206
I need to see your notes.

06:54.206 --> 06:56.792
Good luck with that. They're in my head.

06:56.792 --> 06:59.962
Listen, I set up the meeting for you
at Pioneertown.

06:59.962 --> 07:03.215
All you gotta do is go in
and seal the deal.

07:03.215 --> 07:05.133
What did you do today?

07:05.801 --> 07:07.427
You know what I've done today?

07:07.427 --> 07:10.305
I cleaned the bathroom
in case my last big client

07:10.305 --> 07:11.765
needs to take a piss.

07:11.765 --> 07:15.644
- The shit you should be doing.
- That's not what I was hired for.

07:15.644 --> 07:18.897
Because I get no help
from my sole employee,

07:18.897 --> 07:21.859
who's driving around in something
out of <i>The Banana Splits</i>.

07:21.859 --> 07:25.571
Hey, this guru's
got stolen paintings everywhere.

07:25.571 --> 07:30.742
Plus, his wife went missing,
which means, hello, reward.

07:30.742 --> 07:35.122
You're not gonna get the 70 grand.
She doesn't wanna be found.

07:35.122 --> 07:36.290
You knew about this?

07:36.290 --> 07:37.708
You haven't heard about this?

07:37.708 --> 07:41.587
Where am I gonna hear about it,
the cancan line at Pioneertown?

07:41.587 --> 07:45.257
Look, she left a note.
She drained the bank account.

07:45.257 --> 07:47.885
They found her car in Mexico.

07:47.885 --> 07:49.970
The family, they wanted answers.

07:49.970 --> 07:53.891
So yeah, I'm sure.
There was a reward. Was.

07:53.891 --> 07:55.601
This is huge.

07:55.601 --> 07:59.855
No, I just told you it's not.
Now get that thing outta here.

07:59.855 --> 08:01.982
I got a client coming in any minute.

08:01.982 --> 08:04.484
Okay, look. Ready?

08:08.363 --> 08:10.699
Eat the Frito pie. And you're welcome.

08:10.699 --> 08:11.783
Okay, go!

08:31.428 --> 08:35.765
Hey, Carol. Check it out. My new car.

08:36.433 --> 08:38.684
They wanted me to get something sensible.

08:38.684 --> 08:41.145
<i>Peggy, your mother is getting on the bus.</i>

08:41.145 --> 08:43.023
The mother I told you about?

08:43.023 --> 08:44.441
<i>I think so.</i>

08:44.441 --> 08:46.276
Please follow her.

08:46.276 --> 08:48.737
Send me the coordinates.
I'll be right there!

09:00.791 --> 09:02.209
- I gotta go.
- Okay.

09:36.618 --> 09:39.121
Hey!

09:39.121 --> 09:41.540
Wait. Thank you.

09:42.666 --> 09:44.209
Thank you.

09:48.338 --> 09:51.175
- I got your car!
- The keys are in it!

09:51.175 --> 09:52.593
Yeah.

10:12.821 --> 10:14.656
There are empty seats.

10:16.325 --> 10:17.326
Pretty day, huh?

10:18.368 --> 10:20.204
Palm Springs. They're all the same.

10:21.788 --> 10:22.915
Where are you from?

10:23.999 --> 10:25.792
Once upon a time, New York.

10:26.418 --> 10:27.419
Syosset.

10:28.670 --> 10:31.882
You look so much like someone
I used to know.

10:32.966 --> 10:35.177
She was gorgeous, by the way.

10:37.262 --> 10:39.389
You're not trying to pick me up, are ya?

10:39.389 --> 10:42.226
No way. I got too much on my plate.

10:46.480 --> 10:49.316
I suppose I'm from the City of Angels too.

10:49.316 --> 10:50.651
Yeah?

10:50.651 --> 10:51.985
I was an actress.

10:53.070 --> 10:55.113
You seem like you'd be very good.

10:55.113 --> 10:56.865
I was.

10:56.865 --> 10:59.493
I was a day player on every show

10:59.493 --> 11:02.454
from <i>Gunsmoke</i> to B.J. and the Bear.

11:03.372 --> 11:04.831
Was that last one a porno?

11:06.583 --> 11:10.796
No. It was about a monkey on the road.
It was very big.

11:10.796 --> 11:13.590
I get it. Monkeys are hypnotic.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.425
This is my stop up here.

11:15.425 --> 11:17.636
No. I need your number first.

11:17.636 --> 11:19.847
I know a shitload of people in theater.

11:19.847 --> 11:21.765
I think I can make something happen
for you.

11:21.765 --> 11:23.892
You're not done yet. Not by a long shot.

11:49.042 --> 11:50.210
<i>She's an actress, right?</i>

11:51.170 --> 11:52.171
Yeah.

11:53.172 --> 11:57.968
This might sound crazy,
Peg, but you should make a play.

12:00.095 --> 12:03.849
She could portray Roslyn,
and you could work all your shit out.

12:05.350 --> 12:10.480
Honey, this is perfect.
It's like Roslyn put her here.

12:12.107 --> 12:13.358
Oh, my God.

12:13.358 --> 12:14.610
Gimme your phone.

12:15.402 --> 12:19.781
I'm putting in an alert for every hour
to remind you to write this play.

12:19.781 --> 12:21.992
A little structure will be good for you.

12:21.992 --> 12:24.203
Look, your phone's ringing.
It looks important.

12:24.203 --> 12:26.079
It's those Mumbai scammers.

12:27.497 --> 12:28.498
Okay.

12:28.498 --> 12:29.833
Peggy Newman.

12:29.833 --> 12:33.754
<i>This is Palm Desert Hospital
and Medical Center. Please don't hang up.</i>

12:33.754 --> 12:36.507
<i>We have a patient here
named Bob Scarborough.</i>

12:36.507 --> 12:38.133
- Hey.
- <i>Your number was on his forearm...</i>

12:38.133 --> 12:39.510
- Scarborough.
- <i>...and he's been reluctant</i>

12:39.510 --> 12:41.595
<i>to give us any other contact numbers.</i>

12:41.595 --> 12:43.263
- You're here for Bob Scarborough?
- Yes.

12:43.263 --> 12:46.266
We couldn't save the nipple.
He's pretty bummed about it.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.060
It's a mistake of nature anyway.

12:48.060 --> 12:50.771
- He'll need to be on pain meds.
- Don't be shy with those.

12:51.355 --> 12:52.940
Sir, your friend's here.

12:53.607 --> 12:55.025
Hi. I'll take it.

12:55.025 --> 12:56.235
Not my friend.

12:56.235 --> 12:58.028
What are you doing here?

12:58.028 --> 13:00.447
They said you were calling my name out
on the floor.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.699
Well, I don't know your name.

13:03.575 --> 13:05.077
Let's go get your pain meds.

13:07.162 --> 13:09.248
You know,
you could have helped me last night.

13:09.248 --> 13:11.124
They were clearly threatening me.

13:12.417 --> 13:14.169
What am I, your big brother?

13:14.169 --> 13:15.420
I gave you wide eyes.

13:15.420 --> 13:20.133
I gave you hostage video eyes,
and I am deformed now.

13:20.133 --> 13:21.301
Look, I'm sorry.

13:21.301 --> 13:24.012
Anyway, here.

13:24.596 --> 13:25.973
Stay ahead of the pain.

13:25.973 --> 13:28.767
It's the key to life. You take two.

13:37.067 --> 13:39.736
So why were your friends
at the driveway so upset with you?

13:44.116 --> 13:46.159
Can I have my Tater Tots, please?

13:46.159 --> 13:48.120
This ride isn't free, by the by.

13:48.120 --> 13:51.123
It's going to cost you three G's,
made out to Pioneertown.

13:51.123 --> 13:55.794
Your girlfriend, Tammy?
She got a boob job for you.

13:56.295 --> 13:58.005
And she stole the money to do it.

13:58.005 --> 14:00.299
I never asked her to do that.

14:01.884 --> 14:03.802
How do they look? The--

14:04.469 --> 14:05.804
Some guru.

14:06.889 --> 14:09.808
Could I have my Tater Tots, please?

14:11.935 --> 14:14.479
I want the money, capisce?

14:16.064 --> 14:18.275
Tots for tits.

14:23.363 --> 14:25.157
So what is this anyway?

14:25.157 --> 14:28.327
"Investigative Series: Death at a Spa."

14:28.911 --> 14:29.995
Is this for real?

14:30.662 --> 14:33.498
It's a Newsey.
You've heard of Newseys, right?

14:33.498 --> 14:35.083
I heard of a Pulitzer.

14:35.083 --> 14:38.921
Newseys are just
for television news exclusively.

14:38.921 --> 14:41.381
Never heard of it. An Emmy I've heard of.

14:42.049 --> 14:44.218
They got two wings.
Yours has only got one.

14:45.219 --> 14:47.012
It's a lot more specific.

14:47.596 --> 14:49.181
It's more like a door prize.

14:49.181 --> 14:50.682
It's very prestigious.

14:51.642 --> 14:54.144
So, this is the real deal, huh?

14:54.144 --> 14:56.939
You know somebody. An art buyer.

14:56.939 --> 14:58.732
I know lots of people, hon.

14:59.566 --> 15:03.362
So, how does a local news anchor
afford a Picasso?

15:05.030 --> 15:06.240
My wife.

15:06.240 --> 15:07.824
You have a wife, huh?

15:09.368 --> 15:10.911
Where is she?

15:10.911 --> 15:14.373
She's gone. I have to go to sleep.
I'm very tired.

15:14.373 --> 15:17.000
We'll talk about your art guy tomorrow.

15:17.000 --> 15:19.044
Where's your checkbook, Bobby?

15:19.044 --> 15:21.463
In the drawer in the kitchen.
It's just Bob.

15:44.570 --> 15:46.822
Oh, my God. Okay.

15:47.364 --> 15:49.533
Hey. Come on.

15:49.533 --> 15:53.328
You look like an escaped mental patient.

15:55.038 --> 15:57.583
Okay. Oh, sh-- What now?

16:01.086 --> 16:02.379
Are we gonna have sex?

16:03.088 --> 16:05.048
I gotta write a play.

16:05.048 --> 16:08.093
You said you have a buyer.
You know somebody.

16:09.136 --> 16:11.680
Of course. Here. Okay.

16:12.764 --> 16:16.393
Here. Sign this. Four grand.

16:18.187 --> 16:19.188
Good boy.

16:20.772 --> 16:21.815
Okay.

16:21.815 --> 16:23.400
Hush.

16:24.943 --> 16:26.069
Sleep tight.

16:26.069 --> 16:27.571
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

16:31.783 --> 16:36.121
"Peggy enters center stage,
totally radiant." Peggy.

16:36.121 --> 16:40.250
"This is a play about love and regret."

16:43.504 --> 16:45.005
"Much like <i>Hamilton</i>."

16:47.049 --> 16:48.050
Good.

17:02.648 --> 17:04.107
What the fuck does he know?

17:04.608 --> 17:06.818
All right there.
Put the feed in your hand.

17:06.818 --> 17:08.194
Flat, just like that.

17:12.616 --> 17:16.662
Wow. This is for $4,000.

17:17.162 --> 17:19.122
He wanted to take care of it,

17:19.122 --> 17:21.208
but he'd like you
to handle something also.

17:21.959 --> 17:25.546
He wants Pioneertown to move on,
no questions asked.

17:26.505 --> 17:28.507
Investigations can be hostile.

17:28.507 --> 17:30.926
- It was Tammy.
- Not confirming, not denying.

17:30.926 --> 17:33.178
The point is, forget about it.

17:36.390 --> 17:38.600
- You changed the combo?
- Yes, I did.

17:38.600 --> 17:40.602
And no, I'm not gonna tell you what it is.

17:40.602 --> 17:41.645
So we're covered,

17:41.645 --> 17:43.605
especially since
you have a security team now.

17:43.605 --> 17:45.148
What security team?

17:45.774 --> 17:47.609
We talked about this, Owen.

17:47.609 --> 17:52.197
What did we talk about right here
in this room? Bruce Harvey Investigations.

17:54.992 --> 17:56.201
I have to talk to Mother.

17:56.201 --> 17:58.036
When? When she's changing your diaper?

17:58.036 --> 18:00.372
You're the leader of this outfit, Owen.

18:00.372 --> 18:01.832
You gotta lead.

18:01.832 --> 18:03.584
How much does it cost?

18:04.209 --> 18:05.627
And what does he even do?

18:05.627 --> 18:09.464
What don't we do? I'll set up a sit-down.
I'm late for a rehearsal.

18:11.091 --> 18:12.467
What are you rehearsing?

18:19.975 --> 18:21.393
I can't even read this.

18:22.811 --> 18:23.812
Are you legally blind?

18:23.812 --> 18:26.899
No, it's chicken scratch. It's illegible.

18:28.192 --> 18:30.235
This is the last day of your life.

18:30.235 --> 18:33.030
You say, "I'm going to Long Island."

18:33.030 --> 18:35.365
You're dying. You're in and out.

18:35.991 --> 18:38.785
And I go,
"We don't live on Long Island anymore."

18:39.620 --> 18:41.288
And then you say,

18:41.288 --> 18:43.874
"I'm going to see my parents in Germany."

18:45.459 --> 18:48.003
And my line is,
"What the fuck you talking about?"

18:48.003 --> 18:49.254
It's all right there.

18:49.254 --> 18:51.798
Well, will we get typed pages?

18:56.762 --> 18:57.596
Take five.

18:59.848 --> 19:00.724
Roger.

19:01.433 --> 19:02.476
Peggy.

19:03.101 --> 19:04.561
Is that Axe body spray?

19:04.561 --> 19:06.021
It's Shalimar.

19:06.021 --> 19:08.941
No perfume in Pioneertown,
even in accounting.

19:09.942 --> 19:12.903
Also,
the saloon area is a closed set today.

19:12.903 --> 19:15.280
I'll have to ask you both to turn around.

19:17.699 --> 19:18.700
Good day.

19:23.539 --> 19:25.123
Is this word "Nazis?"

19:26.959 --> 19:28.919
Germany is still full of Nazis.

19:29.419 --> 19:31.880
Isn't this the 1870s?

19:31.880 --> 19:32.965
Peggy?

19:34.007 --> 19:37.803
Peggy? What is that? What is that sign?

19:37.803 --> 19:40.430
You didn't say anything to me
about any play.

19:42.224 --> 19:43.350
Take another five.

19:43.350 --> 19:45.644
I told you we were in rehearsals.

19:45.644 --> 19:47.688
Hey, Slide City has the surf.

19:47.688 --> 19:48.772
We've got the turf.

19:48.772 --> 19:51.942
We're offering an alternate
to fast-moving water.

19:51.942 --> 19:54.987
And that, my friend,
is heart-wrenching drama.

19:54.987 --> 19:56.488
Look, I don't wanna jinx it,

19:56.488 --> 20:00.534
but I think that this is going to be
like <i>Hamilton</i> in terms of word of mouth.

20:00.534 --> 20:02.160
It's gonna be a frenzy.

20:02.160 --> 20:03.287
What is?

20:03.787 --> 20:06.081
You haven't-- I don't know what it is.

20:06.081 --> 20:07.165
What is it?

20:07.165 --> 20:12.963
Perhaps the greatest tale ever told,
wrapped in a full professional production.

20:15.757 --> 20:17.217
Hey, you see that lady?

20:18.385 --> 20:19.511
She look familiar?

20:21.680 --> 20:22.806
Yes-- Maybe. I--

20:24.766 --> 20:26.518
Okay, yeah. Where have I seen her before?

20:26.518 --> 20:27.686
Everywhere.

20:28.562 --> 20:32.983
She brings pedigree, Owen.
We need that. She's been in everything.

20:32.983 --> 20:34.359
Tremendous following.

20:34.359 --> 20:38.155
Crowds are gonna flock in to see her,
and it's not going to cost you a dime.

20:43.911 --> 20:46.914
Yeah, I've seen her.
I have. Definitely, for sure.

20:46.914 --> 20:48.540
You've seen <i>Designing Women</i>?

20:50.250 --> 20:51.793
Oh, my God.

20:53.003 --> 20:56.215
- <i>The Wire</i>?
- Yes. Wait, she was on <i>The Wire</i>?

20:56.215 --> 20:57.799
Everything but.

20:58.342 --> 21:00.802
Slide City cannot compete with this.

21:02.054 --> 21:05.974
Okay, fine. All right. Go practice.

21:05.974 --> 21:08.185
Do your rehearsing. Act away.

21:08.185 --> 21:10.646
All right. We're back.
Ginger, from the top.

21:10.646 --> 21:12.105
Here. Write this down.

21:12.731 --> 21:15.359
Mommy says, "Get me a kreplach."

21:15.359 --> 21:17.653
No. Make it a cheese Danish.

21:23.784 --> 21:26.995
- Did you seriously change the locks?
- I told you the money is on the way.

21:26.995 --> 21:29.748
- I'm a PI now.
- Oh, really? You don't look like a PI.

21:29.748 --> 21:31.667
I'm working a murder case.

21:34.670 --> 21:37.589
Oh, my God.
Peggy, that looks just like Mommy.

21:37.589 --> 21:42.469
Right? I'm making a play with her
for the catharsis Aristotle talked about.

21:42.469 --> 21:46.098
I'm purging all my mommy shit
so it doesn't give me cancer.

21:46.098 --> 21:48.559
I could write a scene for you.
It's like therapy.

21:48.559 --> 21:51.103
No, I'd rather just take a key
to the house instead.

21:51.103 --> 21:52.396
I don't have a spare.

21:52.396 --> 21:55.691
Really? You made one key?
That's just great, Peggy. Real great.

21:55.691 --> 21:58.277
- Thank you, as always.
- Let's go. Come on, Ginger. Let's go.

21:58.277 --> 21:59.736
Come. Ignore her.

22:05.868 --> 22:08.161
I just gotta get that reward.

22:08.161 --> 22:11.331
Mommy would be so proud of me
if I pull in 70K.

22:11.331 --> 22:14.751
Hey, did you learn anything in that class
about missing persons?

22:14.751 --> 22:19.381
Yes. In fact, I researched
what happened before she disappeared.

22:19.381 --> 22:21.758
You've gotta see it.
I got it off of YouTube.

22:21.758 --> 22:23.468
It's when he lost his job.

22:23.468 --> 22:26.221
I guess I'll go look at that
because I know him now.

22:27.097 --> 22:29.266
Hey! Jus-- Hey!

22:29.266 --> 22:31.143
She just took all your wine.

22:31.143 --> 22:32.269
The whole bottle.

22:33.395 --> 22:36.190
It's a cheap bottle of sauv blanc.
She'll enjoy it.

22:36.899 --> 22:40.027
Wait, are you attracted to this guy?

22:40.027 --> 22:43.614
Who, the guru bastard? No.

22:43.614 --> 22:44.781
Am I?

22:46.700 --> 22:48.827
Maybe in the past, but no more.

22:48.827 --> 22:51.580
I choose not to be attracted to him,
so I'm not.

22:51.580 --> 22:53.248
Okay, good.

22:54.208 --> 22:56.293
It's pirated, 'cause they took it down.

22:56.293 --> 22:58.629
<i>Let's take you to Palm Canyon Drive.</i>

22:59.796 --> 23:03.300
<i>We are hearing that a massive sinkhole
has collapsed there, swallowing a tourist.</i>

23:03.300 --> 23:06.428
<i>Alicia Herrera's on the ground.
She has all of the late-breaking details.</i>

23:06.428 --> 23:08.180
<i>Alicia,
what can you tell us about this tragedy?</i>

23:08.180 --> 23:10.974
<i>Hold on. Hold. Hold on a second.</i>

23:10.974 --> 23:12.851
<i>Is this a tragedy?</i>

23:12.851 --> 23:14.728
<i>It doesn't even really matter.</i>

23:15.354 --> 23:17.606
<i>It's just death</i>. <i>I mean--</i>

23:17.606 --> 23:19.691
<i>That's where we're all headed.</i>

23:19.691 --> 23:21.860
<i>Today, a tourist joined the cosmic beach.</i>

23:21.860 --> 23:24.112
<i>Who cares? 'Cause everything else--</i>

23:24.112 --> 23:28.992
<i>All of this is stupid.
It doesn't matter, you know?</i>

23:28.992 --> 23:31.537
<i>You and your problems,</i>

23:31.537 --> 23:33.747
- <i>her cheating-ass husband--</i>
- <i>The hell, Bob?</i>

23:33.747 --> 23:37.918
<i>All of it is stupid. Everything is stupid.</i>

23:37.918 --> 23:39.878
- <i>Everything is stupid.</i>
- Well, he's not wrong.

23:39.878 --> 23:42.673
<i>Death is fucking coming for all of us,</i>

23:42.673 --> 23:45.843
- <i>and it will blow your fucking mind.</i>
- <i>I am so sorry. Bob.</i>

23:45.843 --> 23:47.845
<i>Barb, shut the fuck up.</i>

23:47.845 --> 23:49.429
- <i>Everybody fucking hates you.</i>
- <i>Bob!</i>

23:49.429 --> 23:51.974
- <i>Bob.</i>
- <i>And you should not wear red. Ever!</i>

23:53.892 --> 23:57.896
A lot of people think like that.
Why do you think they call him Guru Bob?

23:58.814 --> 23:59.940
What the fuck is that?

24:00.983 --> 24:03.151
What's that?
The fuck is that? Is that the cops?

24:03.151 --> 24:05.863
- Is that you, Bezos?
- It's Cooper.

24:05.863 --> 24:07.197
Chad bought it for her.

24:07.197 --> 24:10.993
Jesus! So she's back there,
just drinking your sauvignon blanc?

24:10.993 --> 24:13.412
There's so much more in the garage.

24:13.412 --> 24:17.958
This is just insane.
It was not a stolen check.

24:17.958 --> 24:20.878
I got the check from Peggy Newman.

24:20.878 --> 24:22.921
- It was Peggy's check!
- There.

24:22.921 --> 24:24.923
Well, Peggy didn't try and cash it.

24:25.424 --> 24:26.592
Thumb, please.

24:26.592 --> 24:29.052
- People are such disappointments.
- Hey.

24:33.724 --> 24:35.434
You can't smoke in here.

24:36.476 --> 24:37.477
I don't smoke.

24:39.563 --> 24:41.106
Hey. While I'm waiting,

24:41.106 --> 24:43.692
I'd like to request
a missing person's report.

24:43.692 --> 24:44.860
Name?

24:44.860 --> 24:46.278
Donatella Scarborough.

24:48.697 --> 24:50.115
There he is.

24:51.575 --> 24:52.576
Hey.

24:53.535 --> 24:56.496
Thank you for getting me out.

24:56.496 --> 24:57.831
You're fired.

24:57.831 --> 25:03.212
Hey. You're okay now.
Take it easy. I'm taking care of it.

25:03.212 --> 25:05.923
No. What you can take care of, Peggy,

25:05.923 --> 25:08.175
is cleaning out your locker
because you're fired.

25:08.175 --> 25:10.636
I don't even have my own locker.
I share with Jeannie,

25:10.636 --> 25:13.013
which, considering my seniority,
is a travesty.

25:14.014 --> 25:15.599
Look, I'll get you the money.

25:15.599 --> 25:21.688
No. You are out of time.
And plus, I don't trust you anymore.

25:21.688 --> 25:24.191
Trust is just a construct. So is time.

25:24.191 --> 25:26.860
And speaking of which,
I'll get it by tonight.

25:26.860 --> 25:28.278
Tomorrow, the latest,

25:28.278 --> 25:31.156
- by midnight, plus interest.
- No. No more deals.

25:31.156 --> 25:32.449
I'll get the charges dropped.

25:33.575 --> 25:35.410
The charges have to be dropped
within an hour.

25:35.410 --> 25:37.079
Give me five.

25:37.079 --> 25:38.997
- Your mom's on board.
- What?

25:40.040 --> 25:42.209
Look, I had a little talk
with her, woman to woman.

25:42.209 --> 25:44.044
I knew you were scared to.

25:45.045 --> 25:46.922
Who do you think put up the bail?

25:47.756 --> 25:50.092
God. Bitch.

25:52.636 --> 25:54.179
Owen, don't worry.

25:54.179 --> 25:56.849
Hey, the show
that I'm doing is gonna grab people

25:56.849 --> 26:00.185
by their throats and rip their hearts out
through their eyeballs.

26:00.185 --> 26:01.270
Wh--

26:10.904 --> 26:12.739
Open up, you bastard!

26:14.324 --> 26:16.285
My boss spent the day in the cooler.

26:16.285 --> 26:18.453
You're paying me
and dropping those charges.

26:18.453 --> 26:19.371
I want the money.

26:19.371 --> 26:21.206
Let's discuss it at dinner.

26:22.040 --> 26:23.041
Dinner?

26:25.335 --> 26:27.171
- When?
- Right now.

26:29.548 --> 26:30.549
Where are we talking?

26:30.549 --> 26:32.259
Cheesecake Factory.

26:33.218 --> 26:34.219
Ruth's Chris.

26:34.219 --> 26:35.137
Outback.

26:35.137 --> 26:36.263
Geraldo of Rome.

26:38.891 --> 26:39.892
Fine.

26:44.563 --> 26:45.606
You're paying.

26:49.902 --> 26:51.945
So, this art guy--

26:51.945 --> 26:56.533
Is he still in the game?
Is he still an art dealer?

26:56.533 --> 26:57.993
Yeah.

26:57.993 --> 27:00.579
And weapons and dope.
And kidneys, probably.

27:02.289 --> 27:03.999
So, what's your business with him?

27:05.375 --> 27:09.671
So, I want to sell something
from my collection.

27:10.214 --> 27:13.008
- A Picasso?
- No, a Cézanne.

27:13.509 --> 27:14.510
Uh-huh.

27:15.511 --> 27:17.513
My buyer fell through.

27:17.513 --> 27:18.597
What about Sotheby's?

27:19.181 --> 27:20.891
Their commissions are horrible.

27:20.891 --> 27:23.227
Uh-huh. What's it called?

27:23.227 --> 27:24.561
It is called

27:24.561 --> 27:28.148
<i>View of Auvers de</i>-- something.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.859
A <i>View of Auvers-sur-Oise</i>?

27:32.778 --> 27:33.612
Yes.

27:33.612 --> 27:37.616
'Cause that painting was stolen in '99.

27:43.830 --> 27:44.748
Yeah, I can help you.

27:46.124 --> 27:47.209
For a commission.

27:48.085 --> 27:49.461
How much do you want for it?

27:49.461 --> 27:52.339
I could let you have it
for a million, three.

27:52.339 --> 27:57.344
I need 20 grand as a finder's fee
and four grand up front for Tammy's jugs,

27:57.344 --> 28:00.556
plus for you to drop the bogus charges
against Owen.

28:00.556 --> 28:03.976
And if that check doesn't clear,
I'm taking the other nipple.

28:16.905 --> 28:19.366
You are a huntress.

28:19.867 --> 28:21.785
Is this part of your guru act?

28:22.286 --> 28:24.288
No. Just an observation.

28:27.457 --> 28:30.752
I saw your prophet bit on the news.

28:32.004 --> 28:34.381
By the way,
most people can't handle the truth.

28:34.381 --> 28:35.841
That's what I always say.

28:38.302 --> 28:39.511
There's your friend.

28:41.054 --> 28:42.472
Yeah, you're leaking a little.

28:42.472 --> 28:43.932
She's following me.

28:43.932 --> 28:45.225
What's her beef?

28:45.225 --> 28:47.019
How soon can you reach your guy?

28:47.019 --> 28:48.103
Who, Kachel?

28:48.103 --> 28:50.314
I can reach him tonight. Tomorrow.

28:50.314 --> 28:51.857
Wednesday, the latest.

28:51.857 --> 28:55.027
I don't know if he'll come personally,
but he's got people, you know?

28:57.070 --> 29:01.283
I need you
to give me Tammy's money tonight.

29:01.283 --> 29:03.118
And I need you to drop those charges.

29:03.118 --> 29:05.579
Yeah, I don't carry a checkbook on me.

29:10.626 --> 29:12.169
You stole one of my checks?

29:12.169 --> 29:14.213
Why didn't you just go ahead
and sign it too?

29:14.213 --> 29:16.882
That would be illegal and trashy.

29:16.882 --> 29:18.050
Fine.

29:19.676 --> 29:21.678
And Dianne is calling again.

29:23.180 --> 29:25.057
That's my sister. Just give me a minute.

29:25.807 --> 29:27.226
Guess where I am right now.

29:27.226 --> 29:29.645
Well, you're not home
because I am at the house,

29:29.645 --> 29:32.105
- and Denny is trying to get in here.
- Hey, Dianne, open the door.

29:32.105 --> 29:34.066
- Guess he's out of jail now, huh?
- Hey, you know,

29:34.066 --> 29:35.859
- this is really still my house,
- She's not here, Denny!

29:35.859 --> 29:36.902
I'm not getting any bars here.

29:36.902 --> 29:38.153
- Could you call the police?
- Open up!

29:38.153 --> 29:39.696
How did you get in my house?

29:39.696 --> 29:41.240
<i>I can call a locksmith too, you know.</i>

29:41.240 --> 29:42.741
<i>It is a family house.</i>

29:42.741 --> 29:46.286
But it's not your residence,
it's my residence. It's where I reside.

29:46.286 --> 29:49.248
This is nice.

29:49.248 --> 29:51.250
Yeah. Can we just talk about this?

29:51.250 --> 29:55.420
Honey, do you think this place
is a little expensive for a guy

29:55.420 --> 29:57.381
- that owes people money?
- No, that's why--

29:57.381 --> 29:58.757
Tell Denny he can take a flying fuck.

29:58.757 --> 29:59.925
- You tell Denny...
- Excuse me.

29:59.925 --> 30:02.302
...to take his rap sheet
and his shitty choices,

30:02.302 --> 30:04.930
and shove them up his criminal ass.

30:04.930 --> 30:06.765
- I'm done.
- <i>No, I am done.</i>

30:06.765 --> 30:09.810
Tell him we're gonna be divorced
by default in 11 days,

30:09.810 --> 30:11.311
and I'm counting them.

30:11.895 --> 30:12.980
And you too, Dianne.

30:12.980 --> 30:15.858
Get out of my house!
Get out of my residence.

30:15.858 --> 30:17.317
Ma'am, there are children here,

30:17.317 --> 30:20.946
- and I'm gonna need you to tone it down.
- I'm done! Take it down a notch!

30:20.946 --> 30:23.532
Christ on a truck.

30:23.532 --> 30:24.700
I gotta go.

30:25.826 --> 30:26.827
Who's Denny?

30:29.329 --> 30:30.664
My fucking husband.

30:33.709 --> 30:35.210
When did that happen?

30:38.255 --> 30:39.381
Is that your car?

30:44.678 --> 30:45.762
Nice friends.

30:47.264 --> 30:49.224
At least they left you the other nipple.

31:07.326 --> 31:09.745
Wow. There she is.

31:09.745 --> 31:11.371
Are you fucking kidding me?

31:12.039 --> 31:13.373
Early release.
