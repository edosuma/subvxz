- <i>Something in life,
you're always Worried</i>

00:13.680 --> 00:16.286
<i>about car bombs, shootings.</i>

00:16.315 --> 00:19.263
<i>- This is the most resilient
community in the world.</i>

00:19.285 --> 00:22.129
<i>People survive.
People don't break down.</i>

00:22.155 --> 00:24.362
<i>People are exposed
to awful things here.</i>

00:24.391 --> 00:26.029
<i>- You walk around the corner</i>

00:26.059 --> 00:28.266
<i>and possibly</i> a <i>bomb will go off
or</i> a <i>shooting.</i>

00:28.294 --> 00:29.602
<i>It's just part of life, really.</i>

00:29.629 --> 00:31.438
- <i>There's no point
in being bitter.</i>

00:31.464 --> 00:34.240
<i>All it does in the end
is intensify the situation,</i>

00:34.267 --> 00:36.304
<i>and it widens the whole wound
in Northern Ireland.</i>

00:36.336 --> 00:37.542
<i>- We actually are surviving.</i>

00:37.570 --> 00:39.345
<i>That's the whole story
of Belfast.</i>

00:39.372 --> 00:41.113
<i>- It's really only</i>
a <i>tit-for-tat thing.</i>

00:41.141 --> 00:42.518
<i>Kill</i> a <i>Catholic,
kill</i> a <i>Protestant,</i>

00:42.542 --> 00:43.680
<i>and it's returned.</i>

02:37.824 --> 02:39.428
- Harry.
- Prime Minister.

02:40.527 --> 02:41.528
Ah, kippers.

02:43.463 --> 02:46.501
- What am I doing about Ian's
golden wedding anniversary?

02:46.533 --> 02:47.739
- You got him
a leather photo album.

02:47.767 --> 02:49.747
- Couldn't we do better
than that?

02:49.769 --> 02:50.770
What are the Irish getting him?

02:50.803 --> 02:53.647
- Well, Bertie's got him a bowl
carved from a tree

02:53.673 --> 02:56.916
recovered from the site of
the Battle of the Boyne, 1690.

02:56.943 --> 02:58.718
- Bloody hell.

02:58.745 --> 03:00.224
Can't we steal it?

03:01.648 --> 03:03.924
Well, we do have form.

03:06.953 --> 03:08.728
- So how are you doing?

03:08.755 --> 03:11.235
Do you feel the hand of history
on your shoulder?

03:11.257 --> 03:14.204
Around my throat, more like.

03:14.227 --> 03:15.570
- It's like looking
at the Promised Land

03:15.595 --> 03:17.597
through the wrong end
of a telescope.

03:17.630 --> 03:21.578
- Prime Minister,
I've been at this since 1972.

03:21.601 --> 03:23.547
I've retired three times.

03:23.570 --> 03:25.345
I have more comebacks
than Sinatra.

03:26.306 --> 03:30.311
Every time there is a chink
of light, they drag me back

03:30.343 --> 03:32.823
simply because I know them
better than anyone.

03:32.845 --> 03:38.295
But this time is
the first time I really felt...

03:39.819 --> 03:41.628
Yes, there's a chance.

03:41.654 --> 03:42.860
We can do this.

03:45.425 --> 03:47.268
- Do you say this
to all the prime ministers?

03:48.561 --> 03:49.904
- Of course.

03:50.763 --> 03:52.367
Only this time, I mean it.

03:53.466 --> 03:54.740
- Why now?

03:54.767 --> 03:56.576
- Well, because...

03:56.603 --> 03:59.675
young men fight
for the hell of it,

03:59.706 --> 04:03.552
but old men
care about their legacy.

04:03.576 --> 04:05.886
Now, I think
this is the right time.

04:06.980 --> 04:08.425
- Well, I hope you're right.

04:17.490 --> 04:20.494
Speaking of old men,
Ian disappearing like this

04:20.526 --> 04:21.732
isn't gonna help matters.

04:21.761 --> 04:23.263
- It'll keep him sweet.

04:24.430 --> 04:26.410
50 years of marriage.

04:27.467 --> 04:30.414
It's rumored it's the last time
he said yes to anything.

05:36.002 --> 05:39.381
<i>- Mrs. Thatcher tells us</i>

05:39.405 --> 05:41.646
<i>that that republic</i>

05:41.674 --> 05:46.384
<i>must have some say
in our province.</i>

05:46.412 --> 05:49.086
<i>We say never!</i>

05:49.115 --> 05:52.119
<i>Never! Never!</i>

05:52.352 --> 05:53.797
Never.

05:58.591 --> 06:01.868
Bernie, Bernie, you need
to go easy on the garlic.

06:01.894 --> 06:04.033
- <i>Even though the pressure is on
to make</i> a <i>deal...</i>

06:04.063 --> 06:06.509
- I'm telling-I'm serious.

06:07.967 --> 06:10.072
The last-
the last time I cooked,

06:10.103 --> 06:12.049
the girls said
I nearly poisoned them.

06:13.506 --> 06:15.383
- <i>In the north,
over civil' rights.</i>

06:15.408 --> 06:16.978
<i>In brief,
because the Catholics wanted...</i>

06:17.009 --> 06:18.113
- Ah.

06:18.144 --> 06:20.522
Well, don't blame me.
Blame Delia.

06:20.546 --> 06:22.116
- <i>And the Protestants
Wanted to remain</i>

06:22.148 --> 06:24.059
<i>part of the United Kingdom,</i>

06:24.083 --> 06:25.426
<i>and they've been at it
ever since.</i>

06:25.451 --> 06:26.452
- Right.

06:26.486 --> 06:27.760
- <i>The main players
on the Republican side...</i>

06:27.787 --> 06:30.461
- All right, all right.
Meatballs it is, then. Mm-hmm.

06:30.490 --> 06:33.437
Well, it's not luck we need.

06:33.459 --> 06:35.530
It's divine intervention. Hmm.

06:35.561 --> 06:36.562
Bye.

06:36.596 --> 06:38.576
- <i>The long history
of acrimony and distrust</i>

06:38.598 --> 06:40.077
<i>that comes
with Northern Ireland.</i>

06:40.099 --> 06:43.808
<i>Such an outcome is very much
par for the course.</i>

06:43.836 --> 06:46.476
- <i>But if We're talking about
public perception,</i>

06:46.506 --> 06:48.452
<i>we can go back even further:</i>

06:48.474 --> 06:51.011
<i>the Remembrance Day
bombing in 1987</i>

06:51.043 --> 06:53.080
<i>and that moving
and memorable interview</i>

06:53.112 --> 06:54.682
<i>given by Gordon Wilson</i>

06:54.714 --> 06:57.661
<i>whose daughter, Marie,
died in the explosion.</i>

06:57.683 --> 06:59.083
- <i>I asked her
three or four times...</i>

07:00.119 --> 07:02.429
- <i>She assured</i> me
<i>she was all right.</i>

07:02.455 --> 07:03.729
<i>She screamed every time.</i>

07:05.658 --> 07:07.069
<i>The fifth time I asked her,</i>

07:07.093 --> 07:09.505
<i>she said,
"Daddy, I love you very much."</i>

07:11.531 --> 07:12.942
<i>That's what her last words were.</i>

07:13.966 --> 07:16.879
<i>- What is your reaction now
10-10 the bombers,</i>

07:16.903 --> 07:18.439
<i>the people who did this?</i>

07:19.605 --> 07:21.125
- <i>I prayed for the bombers
fast nigh t.</i>

07:22.608 --> 07:23.951
<i>That God would forgive them.</i>

07:25.711 --> 07:27.156
- Bertie.
- Tony.

07:27.180 --> 07:29.182
- Come through.
Did you have a good journey?

07:29.215 --> 07:31.195
- I did, yes. We came up...

08:35.748 --> 08:37.250
- Divide and conquer.

08:37.283 --> 08:39.229
- Divide and rule.

08:51.230 --> 08:55.178
- To trust them, to acknowledge
their political mandate?

08:55.201 --> 08:57.181
I mean, how can you have
a discussion with someone

08:57.203 --> 08:59.205
who might murder you
if you don't agree with them?

09:03.609 --> 09:05.282
- Policing,
then we're nearly there,

09:05.311 --> 09:07.431
but with the marching,
we're gonna have to fudge that.

09:07.547 --> 09:09.584
Make a new body.
Buy us some time.

09:09.615 --> 09:10.855
Yes? Oh, right.

09:11.717 --> 09:13.219
Just wait a minute.
I'll be back.

09:15.988 --> 09:17.626
- If we're going
with your police,

09:17.657 --> 09:20.297
and that's revolutionary,

09:20.326 --> 09:22.272
and you don't give ground
on parades?

09:34.206 --> 09:35.981
Is there a problem?

09:36.008 --> 09:37.988
- You know
it's his big night tonight.

09:38.010 --> 09:39.011
They've guests coming in

09:39.045 --> 09:40.683
from all over the world
for the celebrations.

09:40.713 --> 09:43.125
- Well, we agreed
it would be fine.

09:43.149 --> 09:45.186
- The storm has closed
Glasgow Airport.

09:45.217 --> 09:47.163
- Ah.

09:47.186 --> 09:48.790
- He'll be devastated.

09:49.855 --> 09:51.300
Is there anything you can do?

09:53.726 --> 09:55.137
- We need a clear
commitment from...

09:55.161 --> 09:56.902
- Hello.

09:56.929 --> 09:59.034
Hi. Hello.

09:59.065 --> 10:02.842
Uh, Gerry, Martin,
bit of a situation.

10:02.868 --> 10:05.644
Um, as you know,

10:05.671 --> 10:07.150
Dr. Paisley is due to attend

10:07.173 --> 10:09.084
his golden wedding
anniversary celebration

10:09.108 --> 10:11.110
in Belfast this evening.

10:11.143 --> 10:15.649
Unfortunately, the weather
has shut Glasgow Airport.

10:15.681 --> 10:19.185
Now, uh, obviously,
this is very important to him.

10:19.218 --> 10:22.222
- Tony and I both agree
that it'd be a nice gesture

10:22.254 --> 10:25.201
and beneficial to the talks
if we could find a way

10:25.224 --> 10:27.670
to get Dr. Paisley
to his celebrations.

10:27.693 --> 10:29.297
- Now, as it happens,
we may be able

10:29.328 --> 10:31.308
to fly him out
of Edinburgh Airport.

10:31.330 --> 10:33.867
Private business jet, bankers.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.207
We've been able
to pull a few strings

10:35.234 --> 10:36.872
and we can get him on board.

10:36.902 --> 10:39.405
And there's a very small
window of opportunity

10:39.639 --> 10:40.640
before the storm shifts.

10:40.673 --> 10:43.051
However...

10:43.075 --> 10:45.021
Before we propose this,

10:45.044 --> 10:46.921
we need to clear it with you.

10:46.946 --> 10:49.790
You know,
favoritism and all that.

10:51.751 --> 10:53.389
- That's absolutely
not a problem.

10:55.788 --> 10:58.826
- Great. Marvelous.

10:58.858 --> 10:59.859
Thank you.

11:01.127 --> 11:02.902
- As long as I fly with him.

11:06.732 --> 11:07.733
- I'm sorry?

11:07.767 --> 11:10.043
- Well, as you well know...

11:11.103 --> 11:13.379
Our protocols dictate

11:13.406 --> 11:15.750
that senior figures
in opposing parties

11:15.775 --> 11:17.015
must fly together.

11:18.110 --> 11:20.454
It lessens the chance
of either side

11:20.680 --> 11:23.126
firing a ground-to-air
missile or...

11:23.149 --> 11:26.824
- Well, surely,
we're beyond the point of...

11:26.852 --> 11:28.195
- Nevertheless.

11:30.256 --> 11:32.031
It would also
give me the opportunity

11:32.058 --> 11:33.731
to consult
with the Army Council.

11:36.362 --> 11:38.364
- Couldn't you just phone them?

11:48.474 --> 11:50.044
- Bertie, we need to talk.

11:58.417 --> 11:59.794
- What are you doing?

12:01.253 --> 12:03.358
- Look, he's going home
into his heartland,

12:03.389 --> 12:04.766
but this time...

12:05.925 --> 12:09.395
If they get a hold of him
before he's said yes,

12:09.428 --> 12:11.339
they will change his mind.

12:11.363 --> 12:13.400
But if Big Ian
doesn't say yes now,

12:13.432 --> 12:15.309
we are just pissing in the wind.

12:17.770 --> 12:19.181
He has to be convinced.

12:19.205 --> 12:20.912
- How?

12:20.940 --> 12:23.750
He hasn't ever spoken
a single word to any of us.

12:23.776 --> 12:24.777
He hates us.

12:24.810 --> 12:27.120
And what if
it's a wild-goose chase?

12:28.080 --> 12:29.957
What if he doesn't speak?

12:29.982 --> 12:33.452
Or what if he does speak
and it all goes to hell?

12:33.486 --> 12:34.897
Martin, we can't take
the risk of-

12:34.920 --> 12:37.230
- We have always
taken the risk, Gerry.

12:38.858 --> 12:40.860
I'd rather it was me and him
going 12 rounds

12:40.893 --> 12:43.999
than that shower of sycophants
that follows him around.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.108
He's 81.

12:48.901 --> 12:51.905
If we don't get to him now,
we will never get to him.

13:00.980 --> 13:02.186
- Don't do this.

13:03.949 --> 13:05.929
Don't cut a deal
with that old bastard.

13:07.887 --> 13:09.867
- I'm not cutting anything,
Rory.

13:11.023 --> 13:12.195
We're just bringing it home.

13:12.224 --> 13:13.999
It's no time for cold feet.

13:16.829 --> 13:19.400
- We announce a ceasefire.
We give up our guns.

13:19.431 --> 13:21.968
We negotiate with the Unionists.

13:22.001 --> 13:23.480
We recognize we're part
of the United Kingdom,

13:23.502 --> 13:25.914
so the Queen is our queen.

13:25.938 --> 13:27.576
We put all
of those things together

13:27.807 --> 13:29.480
and we call it a victory.

13:29.508 --> 13:31.078
Hows that a victory?

13:31.110 --> 13:34.922
- We were fighting for 30 years.
It didn't work.

13:34.947 --> 13:37.553
<i>They could never have beaten us,</i>

13:37.583 --> 13:39.324
<i>but we could never
have beaten them either.</i>

13:39.351 --> 13:41.524
- You should be ashamed
of yourself.

13:41.554 --> 13:42.555
We're soldiers.

13:42.588 --> 13:45.535
<i>There's no shame in losing,
but stand up and admit it.</i>

13:45.558 --> 13:47.902
<i>Don't dress it up
like somehow we've triumphed.</i>

13:49.128 --> 13:51.904
- <i>Politics is</i> a <i>long game, Rory.</i>

13:52.998 --> 13:54.978
<i>You have to stay the course.</i>

13:56.101 --> 13:58.081
<i>Everything we want, we will get.</i>

13:58.103 --> 13:59.446
<i>Maybe not today or tomorrow.</i>

13:59.471 --> 14:01.917
<i>It may take another 30 years.</i>

14:01.941 --> 14:04.945
- Jesus,
I invite you to be with us,

14:04.977 --> 14:07.457
watching over us
and keeping us safe.

14:07.479 --> 14:10.119
- But believe you me,
I would not be talking

14:10.149 --> 14:11.856
to that auld bastard...

14:12.918 --> 14:14.955
If I didn't think
we were gonna get there.

14:14.987 --> 14:17.263
- I pray for an alert mind
whilst traveling.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.394
I pray you keep
this vehicle we're in safe

14:19.425 --> 14:21.098
from mechanical failure.

14:21.126 --> 14:23.970
<i>Thank you for the commitment
you made to me at the cross.</i>

14:23.996 --> 14:25.498
<i>Amen.</i>

14:27.533 --> 14:30.514
- Uh, there's...
well, there's good news

14:30.536 --> 14:32.277
and there's bad news.

14:32.304 --> 14:33.544
- Yes, son?

14:33.572 --> 14:35.882
- Well, the good news is,

14:35.908 --> 14:37.649
they'll get you
to the airport on time.

14:38.544 --> 14:40.490
The bad news...

14:44.617 --> 14:46.426
I'm sorry, Daddy.
We'd no choice.

14:47.987 --> 14:49.967
- It's no skin off my nose.

14:49.989 --> 14:52.469
- You'll be at the airport
in 60 minutes; just say nothing.

14:52.491 --> 14:56.064
- I haven't spoken to him
in 30 years.

14:56.095 --> 14:58.974
Another hour
isn't gonna be any trouble.

15:00.299 --> 15:02.540
- Just enjoy your night.
I wish I could be there.

15:02.568 --> 15:04.377
Don't worry,
I'll hold the fort here.

15:07.606 --> 15:08.914
. Okay

15:13.946 --> 15:16.119
- The jet touches down at 7:00;
the weather's closing in,

15:16.148 --> 15:18.219
so if you're not there,
they won't hang around.

15:18.250 --> 15:20.560
You'll be cleared straight onto
the tarmac, but 7:00, okay?

15:20.586 --> 15:22.566
That's your end game.
- I'll be there by 6:00.

15:47.579 --> 15:49.320
- So far, so good.

16:20.212 --> 16:22.123
- Do I recognize you
from somewhere?

16:22.147 --> 16:23.592
<i>'</i> Hmm?

16:23.615 --> 16:26.323
- I do, don't I?

16:26.352 --> 16:27.763
Are you on TV?

16:27.987 --> 16:30.695
- We're politicians.

16:30.723 --> 16:33.704
- Guess who I had
in the back of the car once.

16:33.726 --> 16:35.706
Samuel L. Jackson.

16:35.728 --> 16:37.605
Oh, I know.
He was playing golf.

16:37.629 --> 16:39.472
Well, not right there
in the back.

16:39.498 --> 16:40.738
At St. Andrews.

16:42.434 --> 16:43.572
Do you follow the golf?

16:45.004 --> 16:48.144
- I'm more of a cricket man
myself, so I am.

16:48.173 --> 16:49.584
- You and me both, pal.

16:51.577 --> 16:54.217
But aren't you, like, Irish
or something?

16:54.246 --> 16:55.966
I just didn't think
the Irish liked cricket.

16:56.015 --> 16:57.426
- There's a lot
would surprise you

16:57.449 --> 16:59.258
about the Irish, so there is.

16:59.284 --> 17:01.059
- And what about you, sir?

17:01.086 --> 17:04.226
- I do not have time
for cricket.

17:04.256 --> 17:07.601
- Ah. Okay, I do know your face.

17:07.626 --> 17:09.263
Who are you really?

17:10.695 --> 17:13.369
- This is Dr. Ian Paisley,

17:13.398 --> 17:16.311
leader of
the Democratic Unionist Party,

17:16.335 --> 17:20.750
founder and moderator
of the Free Presbyterian Church.

17:20.772 --> 17:22.047
- Cool.

17:23.541 --> 17:25.078
And you, sir?

17:25.109 --> 17:27.420
- This is Martin McGuinness,

17:27.445 --> 17:31.622
former chief of staff
of the Irish Republican Army.

17:31.650 --> 17:33.152
- Allegedly.

17:40.359 --> 17:41.770
It's Wild, huh?

17:44.263 --> 17:45.401
The rain.

17:46.432 --> 17:49.208
- "I establish my covenant
with you,

17:49.234 --> 17:51.771
"and all flesh shall
never again be cut off

17:51.804 --> 17:53.715
by the waters of the flood."

17:54.706 --> 17:57.550
- You must have a verse
for every occasion, eh?

17:59.845 --> 18:03.486
How about one
for two auld enemies

18:03.515 --> 18:05.495
in the back of a car,

18:05.517 --> 18:08.225
neither one knowing
how to make the first move?

18:08.253 --> 18:11.530
- I have no interest in moves,

18:11.557 --> 18:12.729
Mr. McGuinness.

18:34.713 --> 18:36.522
- <i>Looks like
the rain's stopping.</i>

18:44.690 --> 18:46.761
You know, I...

18:46.792 --> 18:49.170
I didn't mean to be
disrespectful,

18:49.194 --> 18:50.798
or anything,
not recognizing you.

18:50.829 --> 18:53.469
I just always thought
the IRA was led by that guy

18:53.499 --> 18:55.672
with the beard and the pipe,
you know?

18:57.603 --> 18:59.241
So where do you fit in?

19:01.840 --> 19:05.845
- You might call me
the acceptable public face.

19:12.718 --> 19:14.595
- Forecast is not good.

19:15.621 --> 19:18.693
There will be
a lot of unhappy golfers.

19:19.625 --> 19:21.764
Oh, but then
you're into the old cricket.

19:21.793 --> 19:23.329
- Nicely played.

19:24.530 --> 19:27.443
<i>They should feel free
to speak in front of you.</i>

19:27.466 --> 19:29.639
There's an opportunity here
to see how

19:29.668 --> 19:32.205
<i>they really get on
when no one is watching.</i>

19:32.237 --> 19:35.582
<i>You see, we're hoping
that what they have in common</i>

19:35.607 --> 19:37.678
<i>will be enough
to break down the barriers.</i>

19:39.311 --> 19:41.552
<i>That just the two of them
stripped of all this</i>

19:41.580 --> 19:44.356
<i>bureaucracy and scrutiny</i>

19:44.383 --> 19:46.454
will work this out.

19:46.485 --> 19:50.456
Bring a real and lasting peace.

19:51.423 --> 19:54.404
<i>You're young, aren't you?
25? 26?</i>

19:55.360 --> 19:59.399
<i>Still, old enough that you
should know who these men are.</i>

19:59.431 --> 20:01.741
They are The Troubles.

20:02.768 --> 20:04.645
<i>They are civil war.</i>

20:05.737 --> 20:07.842
They are anarchy.

20:18.817 --> 20:21.229
- I prayed for the bombers
last night.

20:21.253 --> 20:23.358
That God would forgive them.

20:56.588 --> 20:57.623
What?

20:58.490 --> 21:00.902
- Shut his eyes
as soon as he got in.

21:00.926 --> 21:03.600
Been like that
for the last ten minutes.

21:04.696 --> 21:05.970
- Oh, bloody hell.

21:05.998 --> 21:09.468
- He's 81,
and he hasn't been well.

21:09.501 --> 21:10.912
- Thatcher operated
on four hours' sleep

21:10.936 --> 21:11.937
and a pact with the devil.

21:11.970 --> 21:14.610
Paisley has the energy of
ten men half his age.

21:14.640 --> 21:17.348
This is just his way
of not engaging.

21:19.378 --> 21:21.324
Wake him up.
- Hold on.

21:21.346 --> 21:23.053
You know what they say
about sleeping dogs.

21:23.282 --> 21:25.353
- It still needs to be done.

21:25.384 --> 21:27.455
At the end of this,
either we hold the peace

21:27.486 --> 21:28.556
or we go back to war.

21:29.988 --> 21:32.798
You do have a flair
for the dramatic.

21:36.561 --> 21:37.699
- God, sorry!

21:39.831 --> 21:42.311
Oh. I am sorry. Sorry.

21:52.711 --> 21:54.588
- Ay-yi-yi.

22:01.420 --> 22:03.457
So 50 years married, huh?

22:03.488 --> 22:06.799
Oh.
You'd get less time for murder.

22:10.062 --> 22:11.871
I shouldn't have said that.

22:13.065 --> 22:15.807
There's only one possible
comeback...

22:17.069 --> 22:19.709
That I would know
all about murder.

22:21.373 --> 22:22.681
I walked right into it.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.348
Like stepping on a land mine.

22:25.377 --> 22:27.482
Oh, God. There I go again.

22:27.512 --> 22:28.957
- Do you think any of this

22:28.980 --> 22:32.086
is a laughing matter,
Mr. McGuinness?

22:32.117 --> 22:35.496
- No, no, no, absolutely not.

22:38.490 --> 22:40.094
I'm just trying
to break the ice.

22:40.125 --> 22:42.469
- I'm just trying to get home.

22:43.495 --> 22:45.702
- We're all just trying
to get home.

22:48.700 --> 22:50.543
Isn't that profound?

22:59.644 --> 23:00.952
Do you have a signal?

23:06.118 --> 23:09.156
Dr. Paisley, do you have
a mobile phone signal?

23:10.122 --> 23:11.863
- I've absolutely no idea.

23:11.890 --> 23:13.028
- Well, would you check?

23:14.426 --> 23:15.427
- Why?

23:17.796 --> 23:21.608
Do you think I'm gonna lend you
my phone, Mr. McGuinness?

23:21.633 --> 23:24.443
- No, no, of course not.
No, I...

23:24.469 --> 23:25.812
It's just the signal.

23:31.977 --> 23:34.685
So this party of yours
tonight, hmm?

23:34.713 --> 23:36.784
Pints of Guinness
and a bit of boogie, eh?

23:38.617 --> 23:39.618
Oh.

23:39.651 --> 23:40.925
Sorry, I forgot.

23:40.952 --> 23:44.126
Alcohol is the devil's
buttermilk, that right?

23:45.624 --> 23:48.628
And what was it
you said about dancing?

23:48.660 --> 23:51.539
Oh, no, no, no,
not just dancing.

23:51.563 --> 23:53.474
Line dancing.

23:53.498 --> 23:55.500
Poor, inoffensive line dancing.

23:55.534 --> 23:58.538
- Mr. McGuinness,
my party is not your affair.

23:59.604 --> 24:01.982
But for your information,
line dancing is as sinful

24:02.007 --> 24:04.078
as any other type of dancing.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.555
With its sexual gestures
and touching,

24:06.578 --> 24:09.024
it's an incitement to lust.

24:09.047 --> 24:10.720
- Not the way I do it, it isn't.

24:12.617 --> 24:14.028
I'm only winding you up.

24:15.120 --> 24:18.590
- No, Mr. McGuinness,
you're not.

24:29.534 --> 24:33.710
- So what's your position on
the great Samuel L. Jackson,

24:33.738 --> 24:35.081
hmm?

24:35.106 --> 24:37.643
Would you shake his hand
if we stopped to pick him up?

24:39.177 --> 24:43.592
- Andrew Jackson was the seventh
president of the United States.

24:44.683 --> 24:46.890
He was a Presbyterian
of good Ulster stock.

24:46.918 --> 24:48.124
I'd shake his hand.

24:49.221 --> 24:53.260
I've absolutely no idea
who Samuel L. Jackson is.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.029
- Oh. He's a movie star.

24:58.029 --> 25:00.805
<i>Pulp Fiction, Jackie Brown.</i>

25:02.934 --> 25:04.572
<i>Snakes on a Plane.</i>

25:04.603 --> 25:05.707
That's still playing

25:05.737 --> 25:07.216
in the pictures,
if you wanted to go.

25:07.239 --> 25:09.685
- Mr. McGuinness,
I haven't been to the pictures

25:09.708 --> 25:11.915
since 1973.

25:12.978 --> 25:14.048
- Seriously?

25:17.549 --> 25:18.789
Well, what did you go to see?

25:18.817 --> 25:21.161
- I didn't go to see anything.

25:21.186 --> 25:24.065
I was protesting outside.

25:24.089 --> 25:26.831
- 1973...

25:26.858 --> 25:30.032
What would have got your goat
in 1973'?

25:30.061 --> 25:32.735
Uh, 19...

25:32.764 --> 25:36.541
Oh.
Was it The Sting, huh?

25:36.568 --> 25:39.913
All that gambling
offended your sensibilities?

25:40.739 --> 25:41.774
No.

25:43.308 --> 25:45.618
What about you? 1973.

25:45.644 --> 25:47.783
- '73'? Uh...

25:47.812 --> 25:49.883
Hold on.
I'll just phone my granddad.

25:51.716 --> 25:54.754
- Enter the Dragon.
That-that would have been 1973.

25:54.786 --> 25:56.663
Well, too much violence, eh?

25:58.089 --> 25:59.625
No.

25:59.658 --> 26:01.604
No, it wasn't that.

26:01.626 --> 26:04.732
I know what it was. Of course.

26:04.763 --> 26:07.744
<i>The Exorcist. Mm-hmm.</i>

26:09.067 --> 26:11.843
"Your mother sucks"...

26:11.870 --> 26:15.079
- We protested peacefully
outside.

26:15.106 --> 26:17.814
Your lot set incendiary bombs

26:17.842 --> 26:19.719
and burned them down.

26:48.807 --> 26:50.047
Hello, dear.

26:51.343 --> 26:53.345
No, no, everything is fine.

26:55.313 --> 26:57.623
Have our guests
started arriving?

26:59.818 --> 27:02.025
Oh, no, I'll be there on time.

27:03.254 --> 27:05.860
I wouldn't miss it
for the world.

27:08.059 --> 27:10.130
Yes, I have company.

27:12.063 --> 27:15.704
No, no, nobody important.

27:18.203 --> 27:21.184
All right, dear, yes.
Yes, all right, yes.

27:28.313 --> 27:29.986
- So you have a signal.

27:35.286 --> 27:37.926
Could I borrow
your phone, please?

27:37.956 --> 27:39.799
Just-just for
a couple of minutes to-

27:39.824 --> 27:41.735
- No, you may not.

27:41.760 --> 27:44.764
My phone is not
for the likes of you.

27:46.097 --> 27:47.872
- All right, okay.

27:48.967 --> 27:51.811
It's your phone. Absolutely.

27:56.808 --> 27:58.448
Look, if I could
just even send a text to-

27:58.677 --> 27:59.678
- No.

28:01.713 --> 28:04.751
A text is not gonna kill you.

28:04.783 --> 28:09.892
Oh, unless, of course,
it's a-it's an order.

28:11.289 --> 28:12.825
Oh, come on.

28:17.062 --> 28:19.975
Jesus Christ, how are we
supposed to get anything done-

28:19.998 --> 28:22.035
- You watch your language
with me, boy!

28:22.067 --> 28:23.068
- Don't "boy" me!

28:23.101 --> 28:25.047
- Well, do not take
the Lord's name in vain.

28:25.070 --> 28:27.846
- Oh, all right, all right,
okay, okay.

28:35.480 --> 28:37.790
That's always been the problem
with you.

28:39.284 --> 28:41.321
- You have no give in you.
- Really?

28:41.352 --> 28:44.890
That's why we're all
sitting up the road then, is it?

28:44.923 --> 28:45.993
- Just give me the phone,
will you?

28:46.024 --> 28:47.298
Extend the olive branch.

28:47.325 --> 28:49.362
- Well, I'd imagine
you'd be more familiar

28:49.394 --> 28:51.101
with Special Branch.

28:57.335 --> 28:59.042
- That's good.

29:01.506 --> 29:02.917
That's funny.

29:09.214 --> 29:11.888
You've been like this
your whole life, haven't you?

29:14.385 --> 29:16.092
My way or the highway.

29:16.121 --> 29:21.366
- It isn't a question of it
being my way, Mr. McGuinness.

29:21.392 --> 29:24.839
It's a question of it being
the right way, of God's way.

29:24.863 --> 29:27.537
- Oh, because God is always
whispering in your ear.

29:27.766 --> 29:29.768
- Well, perhaps if you
listened a little bit harder,

29:29.801 --> 29:32.441
you might hear him
whispering in your ear too.

29:32.470 --> 29:35.041
- I hear him whispering, okay?
Oh, yeah.

29:36.207 --> 29:38.050
Jesus we pt.

29:42.347 --> 29:45.794
- Are you a married man,
Mr. McGuinness?

29:45.817 --> 29:47.797
- Yes, I am.

29:47.819 --> 29:50.356
- So what does she make
of your, um...

29:51.790 --> 29:53.827
Your career choices?

29:54.492 --> 29:56.369
Of the blood on your hands?

29:56.394 --> 29:59.898
- She's in my corner,
good times and bad.

30:01.099 --> 30:02.237
As I'm sure yours accepts-

30:02.267 --> 30:06.443
- There's no blood on my hands,
Mr. McGuinness.

30:06.471 --> 30:08.348
- Please, stop.

30:09.841 --> 30:11.377
We were at war, never at peace.

30:11.409 --> 30:13.389
- Yes, a peace
that allows your lot

30:13.411 --> 30:16.255
to rob and kill and use that-

30:16.281 --> 30:18.261
- It's not perfect.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.058
But that's why we're here,
isn't it'?

30:20.084 --> 30:21.392
To sort it out.

30:21.419 --> 30:22.955
The final solution.

30:24.355 --> 30:27.393
L-I don't mean
the "final solution."

30:27.425 --> 30:31.134
I mean-
I mean, a final solution.

30:37.368 --> 30:38.403
One way or the other...

30:41.339 --> 30:44.377
I just want to say,
I hope you have a good night.

30:44.409 --> 30:46.286
And a good party.

30:46.311 --> 30:48.257
50 years, hmm.

30:49.547 --> 30:51.925
If you don't mind me asking,

30:51.950 --> 30:57.161
you don't dance,
and you don't drink,

30:57.188 --> 30:58.963
so how did you meet her?

31:05.096 --> 31:06.939
- It was the Titanic.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.011
- How old are you?

31:10.034 --> 31:12.036
- Her father owned
a grocery shop,

31:12.070 --> 31:15.108
bottom of the Nevvtownards Road
right near the shipyard

31:15.139 --> 31:17.983
where the Titanic was built.

31:18.009 --> 31:21.513
I was, uh... I was preaching
on some waste ground opposite.

31:21.546 --> 31:23.150
It was a big crowd.

31:24.148 --> 31:28.153
I could see her standin'
in the shop doorway, apron on,

31:28.186 --> 31:31.463
listening, and my eye
kept coming back to her.

31:31.489 --> 31:35.437
I said, um, "How proud
we should be of the Titanic.

31:35.460 --> 31:37.064
It's such an immense
achievement."

31:37.095 --> 31:40.076
And someone shouted,
"The bloody thing sank!"

31:40.098 --> 31:41.600
And I Said, "Well, it...

31:41.633 --> 31:43.237
it was all right
when it left here."

31:44.636 --> 31:46.946
She was the only one
who laughed.

31:48.006 --> 31:51.419
So when I'd done, I followed her
into the-into the shop.

31:51.442 --> 31:53.149
- To chat her up?

31:53.177 --> 31:55.555
Hmm. I'd like to have seen that.

31:55.580 --> 31:58.220
Ian Paisley chatting someone up?

31:58.249 --> 32:02.425
- Oh, believe it or not, I was
quiet and shy in those days.

32:02.453 --> 32:05.662
- Dr. Paisley,
you were never quiet.

32:08.927 --> 32:10.099
- Quieter.

32:12.397 --> 32:16.004
She was up a ladder
stocking shelves.

32:18.369 --> 32:21.373
She glanced around at me,
and her cheeks went all pink.

32:21.406 --> 32:23.716
She asked me if she could
help me, and I said...

32:25.410 --> 32:28.118
"Do you have
any aeroplane biscuits?"

32:28.146 --> 32:30.183
And she said, "What are those?
I've never heard of them."

32:30.214 --> 32:34.026
And I said, "You know,
they're the wee plain ones."

32:35.086 --> 32:36.724
She started giggling.

32:43.127 --> 32:44.367
And that was that.

32:44.395 --> 32:46.636
- Ian Paisley,
the stand-up comic, huh?

32:49.534 --> 32:51.411
Tell me somethin'.

32:51.436 --> 32:54.178
After all these years,

32:54.205 --> 32:57.186
does she still enjoy
all the grandstanding?

32:57.208 --> 32:59.654
- The grand...
- Yeah, like she never says,

32:59.677 --> 33:03.215
"Ian, would you
wind your neck in?"

33:03.247 --> 33:07.696
I mean, you stood in the middle
of the European Parliament

33:07.719 --> 33:10.393
and called the Pope
the Antichrist.

33:11.689 --> 33:14.761
I mean, did she not tell you
to catch yourself on?

33:14.993 --> 33:16.438
She-she thought
that was a good idea?

33:16.461 --> 33:18.304
- She did,
and it had to be said.

33:18.329 --> 33:19.740
- You mugged the Pope.

33:19.764 --> 33:23.075
- Mr. McGuinness,
I am not a man of violence-

33:23.101 --> 33:26.742
- Do you or do you not believe

33:26.771 --> 33:30.082
that the European Union
is part of a conspiracy

33:30.108 --> 33:32.611
to create
a Roman Catholic super state

33:32.643 --> 33:33.747
controlled by the Vatican?

33:33.778 --> 33:36.088
- I do and it is.
- Brilliant.

33:36.781 --> 33:41.787
And did you or did you not
write that seat number 666

33:42.020 --> 33:46.298
in the European Parliament
is reserved for the Antichrist?

33:47.492 --> 33:49.563
Oh, fabulous.

33:49.594 --> 33:53.269
Do you really, really,
really believe all this?

33:53.297 --> 33:54.640
You know, I'm not mocking you.

33:54.665 --> 33:57.077
You're entitled
to your opinions.

33:57.769 --> 34:00.773
I'm mocking the poor blind fools
that swallow it all

34:00.805 --> 34:02.284
hook, line and sinker.

34:03.374 --> 34:06.617
They elect you
again and again and again.

34:06.644 --> 34:10.524
The most popular politician
in Europe and the most extreme.

34:10.547 --> 34:14.052
- All I do is follow
the teachings of the scriptures.

34:15.386 --> 34:18.161
And I challenge any man
to find different.

34:18.188 --> 34:19.565
- And scriptures told you

34:19.590 --> 34:21.030
to burn Catholics
out of their homes?

34:21.059 --> 34:23.596
- I didn't.
- You incited people to do it.

34:23.628 --> 34:25.232
- I preach the Lord's words.

34:25.263 --> 34:29.370
- You said priests and nuns were
handing out sub machine guns.

34:29.400 --> 34:31.710
- And they were.
- Oh, for God's sake.

34:31.735 --> 34:34.114
Do you know why,
in nearly 30 years,

34:34.138 --> 34:37.277
the IRA has never,
never once tried to kill you?

34:38.109 --> 34:40.521
Because you,
with all your bigotry,

34:40.545 --> 34:44.186
all your "Save Ulster
from Sodomy" campaigning,

34:44.215 --> 34:46.525
seein' Antichrists
around every corner,

34:46.551 --> 34:50.590
you have done more damage
to your own lot

34:50.621 --> 34:54.626
than the IRA could have ever
done with a thousand bombs.

34:54.659 --> 34:57.196
- That's a matter of opinion,
and you're wrong!

34:58.196 --> 35:01.769
Your lot have made at least
three attempts at my life.

35:01.799 --> 35:02.800
- Nope.

35:04.235 --> 35:05.805
At least our side hasn't.

35:11.109 --> 35:13.749
- <i>You can almost taste it,
can't you?</i>

35:13.778 --> 35:16.452
<i>The hatred. Thick as blood.</i>

35:17.715 --> 35:19.888
<i>It congeals in the same way too.</i>

35:20.118 --> 35:22.655
Forms a scab
that keeps the poison in.

35:22.687 --> 35:26.191
But every once in a while,
a little just leaks out.

35:26.224 --> 35:29.603
Just enough to pollute
everything it touches.

35:29.627 --> 35:32.471
Imagine the Twin Towers falling.

35:32.497 --> 35:33.703
Falling twice.

35:34.565 --> 35:37.512
That's the kind of violence
we're talking about.

35:37.535 --> 35:42.245
And all caused
by children bickering.

35:42.273 --> 35:47.552
<i>And yet these are our bright
and shining beacons of hope.</i>

35:47.578 --> 35:49.353
You see, a beating...

35:51.215 --> 35:53.695
Or a murder or a bomb

35:53.718 --> 35:56.927
<i>that kills two or three people
isn't enough anymore.</i>

35:57.155 --> 35:59.726
<i>Not since 9/11.
It means nothing.</i>

35:59.757 --> 36:03.728
For terror to be effective,
it now has to be massive.

36:05.463 --> 36:08.239
Has to be
a Hollywood spectacular.

36:08.866 --> 36:11.312
<i>And these men
haven't the stomach for it.</i>

36:11.335 --> 36:12.575
<i>Not anymore.</i>

36:13.504 --> 36:14.881
But...

36:14.906 --> 36:17.284
there's always
a new generation coming up

36:17.308 --> 36:20.346
more ambitious, more outrageous.

36:23.281 --> 36:24.419
<i>These men and these women,</i>

36:24.448 --> 36:26.928
<i>they need
to be nipped in the bud.</i>

36:29.554 --> 36:32.865
<i>And your passengers can do that</i>

36:32.890 --> 36:37.464
<i>if they can just get over
their own poisonous past.</i>

36:48.706 --> 36:50.310
How are we doing for time?

36:50.341 --> 36:52.617
- We're on schedule.
In fact, we're a little ahead.

36:52.643 --> 36:54.645
- Let's lose the security car.

37:19.637 --> 37:22.015
- Where is the security car?

37:22.240 --> 37:23.514
<i>-</i> Sir?

37:23.541 --> 37:24.952
- The security car?

37:24.976 --> 37:25.977
It was there a minute ago
and then-

37:26.010 --> 37:27.853
- To tell you the truth,
I wasn't even aware

37:27.878 --> 37:29.824
there was a security car.

37:30.581 --> 37:31.685
- Of course, there was.

37:32.984 --> 37:34.622
It was right behind us.

37:34.652 --> 37:36.723
- Oh, the irony.

37:36.754 --> 37:40.327
The great Republican
Martin McGuinness

37:40.358 --> 37:41.860
getting nervous

37:41.892 --> 37:44.964
because the Queen's men
aren't here to protect him.

37:44.996 --> 37:46.669
- It's not that. It's...

37:46.697 --> 37:48.608
- Do you think
someone's gonna take you out?

37:48.633 --> 37:52.843
This might be Scotland,
but it-it is Calvin country.

37:52.870 --> 37:54.816
There's no love lost
for the likes of you,

37:54.839 --> 37:56.409
so you might have a point.

37:57.575 --> 38:00.351
Or is it your own side
you're worried about?

38:00.378 --> 38:02.551
- Don't be ridiculous.

38:02.580 --> 38:05.959
Well, we should have protection.
We're... politicians.

38:05.983 --> 38:07.724
- Oh, really? Oh!

38:07.752 --> 38:10.392
Oh, yeah,
that's what you are, is it?

38:10.421 --> 38:12.594
Ah, well, you've come a long way

38:12.623 --> 38:14.000
from the wee guttersnipe

38:14.025 --> 38:16.528
hurling rocks
at British soldiers.

38:16.560 --> 38:20.940
Or did the, uh... the balaclava
get a bit too scratchy?

38:20.965 --> 38:24.003
Now you've a nice suit
and shiny shoes.

38:24.035 --> 38:27.676
You're quite the respectable
little democrat.

38:27.705 --> 38:29.082
- At least I aspire to it.

38:29.307 --> 38:31.378
Can I please borrow
your bloody phone?

38:31.409 --> 38:32.786
- No.

38:33.811 --> 38:36.348
- <i>You're 35 miles
from Edinburgh Airport,</i>

38:36.380 --> 38:37.916
<i>and that is not very far.</i>

38:37.948 --> 38:41.657
We've diverted you to
the Lomond Hills Regional Park

38:41.686 --> 38:44.030
to give them a bit more time.

38:44.055 --> 38:47.366
So just drive around
for as long as you can.

38:47.391 --> 38:49.598
Try not to be obvious.

38:49.627 --> 38:50.867
By the time you leave that park,

38:50.895 --> 38:53.808
we want them singing off
the same hymn sheet.

39:00.404 --> 39:01.849
- Hey, where are we goin'?

39:02.907 --> 39:04.614
- Sorry,
there's a diversion ahead.

39:04.642 --> 39:06.849
The roads flooded
with all the rain.

39:06.877 --> 39:08.618
It's just a wee bit of a detour.

39:08.646 --> 39:10.057
Shouldn't slow us down at all.

39:55.593 --> 39:57.869
- Hey, what are we doing
in the middle of a forest?

39:57.895 --> 39:59.602
<i>- Shortcut, sir.</i>

40:00.731 --> 40:03.143
<i>We'll be joining the M90
on the other side.</i>

40:03.167 --> 40:04.908
- <i>Shortcut?</i>

40:06.036 --> 40:07.481
- Shortcut?

40:15.112 --> 40:17.422
Jesus!

40:17.448 --> 40:18.483
- What's going on?

40:18.516 --> 40:20.120
- Sir, they-they appear
to have crashed.

40:20.151 --> 40:22.654
- I told you to buy time,
not bloody-

40:22.686 --> 40:24.131
<i>- Sorry. Sorry, sorry, sorry.</i>

40:24.155 --> 40:25.828
- Look, can you hear me?

40:25.856 --> 40:27.893
What the hell is going on?

40:36.634 --> 40:38.011
Are you all right, sir?

40:38.035 --> 40:39.605
Are you okay?

40:39.637 --> 40:41.639
- Yes, I am. I'm grand.

40:41.672 --> 40:43.948
Yes, uh, what was that?
- Sorry, a deer.

40:43.974 --> 40:46.750
A deer, it just ran
right out in front.

40:46.777 --> 40:48.984
I did hit the brakes,
but we slid.

40:49.013 --> 40:51.118
Are you okay?
- I'm fine.

40:51.148 --> 40:53.094
- Okay, so just stay inside

40:53.117 --> 40:55.188
while I check on the damage,

40:55.219 --> 40:57.199
and we'll be back on the road
in no time.

40:58.122 --> 40:59.931
- They're getting out.

41:01.225 --> 41:03.933
For God's sake,
don't let them get out.

41:05.496 --> 41:07.840
We need to keep <i>them in</i> the car.

41:07.865 --> 41:10.025
<i>What are they saying? I can't
hear what they're saying.</i>

41:25.683 --> 41:28.527
- There goes your party.
- No, don't even say that.

41:28.552 --> 41:31.692
Okay. This is...
This is no problem.

41:31.722 --> 41:33.793
Okay. This is no problem at all.
Now...

41:35.826 --> 41:39.273
Just, uh, I'm gonna just go
and fix the, uh...

41:39.497 --> 41:41.238
Fucking hell.

41:41.265 --> 41:42.801
<i>Just wait.</i>

41:49.006 --> 41:50.952
- About bloody time.

41:50.975 --> 41:52.852
Did you deliberately prang it?

41:52.877 --> 41:54.083
<i>- No. Okay, no.</i>

41:54.111 --> 41:56.284
What am I supposed to do now?

41:56.514 --> 41:58.187
- There was no blood or fur...

41:59.950 --> 42:02.260
On the headlight or the tire.

42:02.286 --> 42:03.993
- <i>We have</i> a <i>puncture, yes.</i>

42:04.021 --> 42:05.728
<i>I haven't changed</i> a <i>tire</i> in...

42:05.756 --> 42:07.793
I've never changed a tire.

42:07.825 --> 42:09.634
<i>We don't even know
if it's fixable.</i>

42:09.660 --> 42:11.071
- Well, first...

42:12.062 --> 42:14.099
We lose the security car.

42:14.131 --> 42:15.735
- Hmm.

42:15.766 --> 42:17.268
- Then we make
a mysterious detour

42:17.301 --> 42:19.247
that nobody else
seems to be makin'.

42:20.237 --> 42:23.309
Then we-we crash
for no obvious reason.

42:23.541 --> 42:26.715
- <i>You need to get the spare tire
out of the boot.</i>

42:26.744 --> 42:28.553
You need to get the jack,

42:28.579 --> 42:31.924
and above all, you need to hear
what they're saying.

42:31.949 --> 42:35.761
- You'd nearly think
they want us marooned out here.

42:36.720 --> 42:38.791
- You might think that.

42:38.822 --> 42:40.824
I suppose, in your line of work,

42:40.858 --> 42:44.738
you have to live with
a certain amount of paranoia.

42:44.762 --> 42:46.605
It was an accident.
It will be fixed.

42:46.630 --> 42:48.132
We will make our flight.

42:48.165 --> 42:50.076
- Yeah, you sure about that,
hmm?

42:50.100 --> 42:52.137
You get a wee Whisper
from up above, huh?

42:54.271 --> 42:57.775
Maybe he doesn't want us
to leave the talks.

42:58.676 --> 43:01.247
Maybe he thinks
your golden wedding party

43:01.278 --> 43:04.122
is an extravagance
we can't afford.

43:04.148 --> 43:05.991
- Gents,

43:06.016 --> 43:08.895
the good news is that
the engine is fine.

43:08.919 --> 43:12.162
So if you just want
to get back in the car,

43:12.189 --> 43:15.227
I'll change the tire, and we'll
soon be back on our way.

43:16.827 --> 43:19.831
- Have you ever changed
a tire before, young man?

43:20.965 --> 43:22.205
<i>-</i> Sir?

43:22.232 --> 43:24.212
- You have to jack it up, boy.

43:24.234 --> 43:26.612
That means we can't
be in the back, no!

43:31.609 --> 43:33.350
- I'm with Bertie now.

43:33.377 --> 43:35.857
Policing.
We're going round in circles.

43:38.015 --> 43:40.154
I, uh, hope you don't mind.

43:40.184 --> 43:43.028
I thought it only right
to invite Bertie to, uh...

43:43.053 --> 43:44.088
- on.

43:46.156 --> 43:48.898
- What's-what's going on?
- We had an incident.

43:48.926 --> 43:51.805
Uh, our driver
managed to crash the car.

43:51.829 --> 43:53.206
- Are they...

43:53.230 --> 43:56.700
- No, no, no. No injuries
that we're aware of.

43:57.201 --> 43:59.306
Uh, nothing too serious
with the vehicle.

43:59.336 --> 44:01.009
Uh...
- Where are they?

44:02.773 --> 44:04.252
In a forest.

44:05.709 --> 44:07.017
- What are they doing
in a forest?

44:07.044 --> 44:08.352
- Walking.

44:08.379 --> 44:11.189
- They should be near
the airport by now.

44:11.215 --> 44:12.922
- I'm afraid our grand plan
to get them talking

44:12.950 --> 44:14.861
was, uh, rather misfiring,

44:14.885 --> 44:17.058
so the situation
had to be managed.

44:17.087 --> 44:18.361
- Where's their security?

44:19.156 --> 44:20.760
- It was withdrawn.

44:22.326 --> 44:24.306
- On whose authority?

44:24.328 --> 44:27.434
- Uh, well, they needed time
and a little pressure.

44:28.432 --> 44:32.073
- So you withdrew their security

44:32.102 --> 44:35.709
and allowed a child
to crash the car.

44:36.674 --> 44:39.086
And now they're...
- Yes, Prime Minister.

44:39.109 --> 44:41.350
- Do you think
that's satisfactory?

44:42.880 --> 44:45.451
The two men upon whom this
entire peace agreement depends

44:45.683 --> 44:48.789
wandering by themselves
in a fucking wood!

44:51.789 --> 44:53.234
- And your children?

44:55.025 --> 44:58.029
What do you tell them
about the murders

44:58.062 --> 45:00.338
and the bombs and the...

45:00.364 --> 45:02.935
- You don't understand us
at all, do you?

45:03.801 --> 45:05.940
You insist on seeing it
in terms of murder...

45:05.969 --> 45:07.107
- And genocide.

45:07.137 --> 45:09.276
- Instead of people
fighting for their rights,

45:09.306 --> 45:10.785
for their country,
for their freedom-

45:10.808 --> 45:14.381
- I only judge it by
the amount of funerals I go to

45:14.411 --> 45:15.981
of ordinary, decent people.

45:16.013 --> 45:19.187
- American independence, hmm?
Terrorists?

45:19.216 --> 45:21.218
French resistance, terrorists?

45:21.251 --> 45:22.491
Horses for courses.

45:22.720 --> 45:25.200
- Do you have nothing

45:25.222 --> 45:27.133
on your conscience at all?

45:35.499 --> 45:37.445
- Sir. Sir, sir, please.

45:40.137 --> 45:41.445
- Look, I...

45:42.372 --> 45:44.352
- Tony.
- Not now.

45:44.374 --> 45:45.478
- Prime Minister.

45:48.312 --> 45:51.384
- Oh, God! Gerry!
Gerry, I can explain.

45:51.415 --> 45:53.895
- Gerry,
it was a shock to me too.

45:53.917 --> 45:56.295
But he's very good at making
something categorically wrong

45:56.320 --> 45:57.924
sound categorically right.

45:57.955 --> 45:59.161
- Bertie, that is not fair.

46:03.761 --> 46:05.001
- Where are they?

46:05.796 --> 46:07.469
- They're wandering in a forest.

46:07.498 --> 46:09.375
- But they're fine.
They're fine.

46:09.399 --> 46:10.469
Gerry, this isn't about you.

46:10.501 --> 46:12.981
It's not about Martin
or these-these images.

46:13.003 --> 46:15.313
You know that.
Bigger picture.

46:21.912 --> 46:25.223
If Bloody Sunday
hadn't happened,

46:25.249 --> 46:27.490
then we would have
just faded away.

46:28.418 --> 46:30.989
13 people
on a civil rights march

46:31.021 --> 46:33.092
shot dead by your Brits.

46:33.123 --> 46:36.366
- Oh, people in glass houses
shouldn't throw stones,

46:36.393 --> 46:38.464
as I believe you did
on that day.

46:38.495 --> 46:41.874
- Oh, piss off, you smug...

46:51.375 --> 46:54.481
13 innocent people
shot in the back, most of 'em.

46:54.511 --> 46:57.219
The next day, we'd so many
volunteers, we couldn't cope.

46:57.247 --> 46:59.523
They were-they were queuing
round the block to join us.

46:59.550 --> 47:01.552
- And you had
your license to kill.

47:01.585 --> 47:03.462
- We were fighting a civil war.

47:03.487 --> 47:04.966
- And you lost.

47:07.124 --> 47:10.003
Isn't-isn't that
what this is all about, huh?

47:11.428 --> 47:14.875
Your precious army
is so riddled with informers,

47:14.898 --> 47:17.139
you can barely
mount an operation.

47:17.167 --> 47:21.172
- I have a political mandate,
just like you.

47:21.205 --> 47:24.049
- You are nothing like me.

48:25.469 --> 48:28.177
I grew up working on farms.

48:29.273 --> 48:30.445
They're vermin.

48:31.508 --> 48:33.044
<i>-</i> It's dying-

48:33.076 --> 48:35.147
- You need to put it
out of its misery.

48:38.148 --> 48:41.220
It shouldn't be a problem
to a soldier like you.

48:57.601 --> 48:59.080
Just do it.

49:56.460 --> 49:58.371
- I'd say the car's
back that way.

50:11.508 --> 50:13.613
- And I'm telling you,
I don't see them.

50:13.643 --> 50:16.283
- Okay, okay,
about 300 meters on your right,

50:16.313 --> 50:17.724
there's a church.

50:22.052 --> 50:23.554
- I don't recognize them.

50:25.155 --> 50:27.032
They must be your lot.

50:34.331 --> 50:38.802
- Ah, these are all
illustrations from the...

50:40.137 --> 50:41.172
<i>From the Book of Martyrs.</i>

50:41.204 --> 50:43.150
- Oh, if it's not
by John Grisham,

50:43.173 --> 50:44.516
I probably haven't read it.

50:45.575 --> 50:48.215
- Back then, the common people

50:48.245 --> 50:51.055
had almost
no other reading matter

50:51.081 --> 50:54.290
except the Bible

50:54.317 --> 50:56.558
<i>and Foxe's Book of Martyrs.</i>

50:56.586 --> 51:00.500
Those who could read
could learn of the full horror

51:00.524 --> 51:04.495
of the atrocities performed
on the Protestant reformers.

51:04.528 --> 51:06.235
The illiterate

51:06.263 --> 51:08.436
could see for themselves

51:08.465 --> 51:12.106
these illustrations.

51:12.135 --> 51:15.548
The book is more
than a record of persecution.

51:15.572 --> 51:18.576
It's a living force

51:18.608 --> 51:21.418
and my inspiration.

51:22.813 --> 51:24.087
- Well...

51:25.782 --> 51:28.388
<i>We Know a thing or two
about martyrs as we“.</i>

51:29.586 --> 51:32.089
- I'm talking about
men of faith.

51:33.256 --> 51:34.394
- So am I.

51:35.592 --> 51:38.471
Ten men
starved themselves to death

51:38.495 --> 51:39.633
for what they believed in.

51:39.663 --> 51:42.234
- Murderers and bombers.

51:43.567 --> 51:47.344
- Bobby Sands was a member of
your blessed British Parliament.

51:47.370 --> 51:48.849
- He was a terrorist.

51:50.474 --> 51:53.318
- 100,000 people
attended his funeral.

51:54.344 --> 51:56.153
You think
they were all terrorists?

51:57.514 --> 51:59.357
- Your hunger strikers

51:59.382 --> 52:01.419
chose to take their own lives.

52:01.451 --> 52:05.456
That was a choice
their many victims didn't have.

52:05.489 --> 52:08.527
And you could have stopped it.

52:08.558 --> 52:11.402
- I could have?
- Yes.

52:11.428 --> 52:14.773
You, Adams...

52:14.798 --> 52:18.644
All you lot with
your ballot paper in one hand

52:18.668 --> 52:21.740
and your Armalite in the other.

52:21.771 --> 52:25.150
The government was willing
to make a deal with you,

52:25.175 --> 52:27.553
but you thought
that the publicity was worth

52:27.577 --> 52:30.786
its weight in gold,
so you wouldn't let them stop.

52:32.782 --> 52:35.422
Until one after the other,

52:35.452 --> 52:38.558
one after the other,

52:38.588 --> 52:41.262
ten men lay dead.

52:42.559 --> 52:44.505
- You know nothing about it.

52:46.196 --> 52:47.675
- I know enough.

52:47.697 --> 52:50.303
- If it wasn't for them,

52:50.333 --> 52:52.677
we wouldn't be
sittin' round a table now.

52:54.604 --> 52:57.210
- There's no deal done yet.

53:04.447 --> 53:06.620
- Bloody hell.
Whose idea was this?

53:06.650 --> 53:09.392
- It was my idea,

53:09.419 --> 53:11.399
and I take
full responsibility for it.

53:11.421 --> 53:12.866
- No, no, no, no.

53:12.889 --> 53:15.392
Well, actually, yes,

53:15.425 --> 53:17.928
but the buck stops with me.

53:19.763 --> 53:21.470
Or does it?

53:21.498 --> 53:24.411
Look, we're-we're all at it.

53:24.434 --> 53:25.970
We're in each other's
pockets on this.

53:26.203 --> 53:28.274
I mean, it goes with
the territory, doesn't it?

53:29.206 --> 53:31.914
Gerry, Martin didn't need
to make that flight.

53:31.942 --> 53:33.888
He volunteered.

53:33.910 --> 53:36.390
- The IRA Army Council ordered-
- Gerry, Gerry, come on.

53:36.413 --> 53:37.551
We know.

53:39.683 --> 53:42.220
Look, I'm on your side.

53:42.919 --> 53:44.227
Okay?

53:45.355 --> 53:47.961
Long term,
I fully support your objectives.

53:47.991 --> 53:49.971
Absolutely, a united Ireland.

53:49.993 --> 53:53.270
And, Ian Kyle Jr.,
in the short term, which,

53:53.296 --> 53:55.469
yeah, might actually
turn out to be quite long,

53:55.498 --> 53:56.738
I fully support yours too.

53:56.766 --> 53:58.473
You remain
part of the United Kingdom.

53:58.501 --> 54:01.380
I mean, my grandfather
was an Orangeman in Donegal,

54:01.404 --> 54:02.474
for goodness sake.

54:03.707 --> 54:06.347
And the moment
that you agreed to your father

54:06.376 --> 54:08.617
traveling with Martin,
you knew what this was about.

54:08.645 --> 54:10.818
So, gentlemen,

54:10.847 --> 54:12.690
I have a foot
in both graves-camps.

54:13.617 --> 54:15.460
But I favor neither.

54:15.485 --> 54:18.694
I favor... peace.

54:20.957 --> 54:24.734
Now I know
it will take a miracle

54:24.761 --> 54:26.798
for these two
to work things out.

54:27.764 --> 54:30.540
And if listening in
can make that happen,

54:30.567 --> 54:33.411
if, as a result,
we can divert traffic

54:33.436 --> 54:36.610
or switch a signal
to improve their chances,

54:36.640 --> 54:38.381
then I fully support
what Harry has done

54:38.408 --> 54:39.580
completely of his own accord.

54:41.611 --> 54:44.558
So I'm asking you, gentlemen,
who may be rightly aggrieved,

54:44.581 --> 54:46.458
to stand with me in this moment

54:46.483 --> 54:48.053
where we are perched
so precariously

54:48.285 --> 54:49.389
on the razor's edge

54:49.419 --> 54:52.832
to see this through
and walk out of this hotel

54:52.856 --> 54:54.858
and straight
into the history books.

54:54.891 --> 54:56.336
- Ditto.

54:59.562 --> 55:01.599
- Come on, big man.
We've a plane to catch.

55:09.806 --> 55:12.946
I've never been one for
talking in public, so I haven't.

55:14.010 --> 55:17.822
Well, no problem
with a small paramilitary unit.

55:19.549 --> 55:20.994
Not like you.

55:21.985 --> 55:24.795
Tens of thousands
roaring you on.

55:27.090 --> 55:28.797
It was your finest hour.

55:34.664 --> 55:36.575
Can we hear a bit of it?

55:40.704 --> 55:43.480
- I don't have the power
I used to have.

55:46.543 --> 55:48.523
I haven't been well.

55:49.779 --> 55:51.417
- Go on, you can do it.

55:51.448 --> 55:53.655
Knock it out of the park, huh?

55:54.884 --> 55:58.593
"Never, never, never!"

55:58.621 --> 56:01.830
<i>- Some say in our province!</i>

56:01.858 --> 56:05.362
<i>We say never!</i>

56:05.395 --> 56:08.968
<i>Never! Never! Never!</i>

56:08.998 --> 56:11.706
I'm not here
for your entertainment.

56:11.735 --> 56:13.646
- Then what are you here for?

56:24.614 --> 56:25.991
- I don't know.

56:26.015 --> 56:27.722
- I'll tell you why we're here

56:27.751 --> 56:29.924
in this godforsaken church.

56:30.987 --> 56:33.126
And it's nothing
you don't already know.

56:35.992 --> 56:38.700
We're here because
we are on the verge of something

56:38.728 --> 56:41.641
the wider world will applaud

56:41.664 --> 56:43.666
but our own people will hate.

56:46.569 --> 56:49.880
You are being asked
to betray your tribe.

56:50.940 --> 56:53.443
And I'm being asked
to betray mine.

56:54.744 --> 56:55.814
That's all.

57:02.819 --> 57:05.959
- How can we even contemplate

57:05.989 --> 57:07.866
doing this?

57:07.891 --> 57:09.564
Hmm?

57:15.432 --> 57:16.467
- What?

57:20.203 --> 57:23.616
- That's the first time
you've said "we."

57:30.914 --> 57:32.518
- Well.

57:32.549 --> 57:33.550
- What?

57:35.985 --> 57:39.558
You are so defensive.

57:51.134 --> 57:54.081
We've spent too much time
in graveyards.

57:54.103 --> 57:55.548
- Aye.

58:03.112 --> 58:05.524
- You know, it's not that...

58:05.548 --> 58:07.255
I don't have any regrets.
It's...

58:07.484 --> 58:09.157
- Walking on the dead there.
Use the path.

58:09.185 --> 58:10.721
Show some respect.

58:18.962 --> 58:20.737
- Do you remember Enniskillen?

58:20.763 --> 58:22.037
- Do I remember it?

58:22.065 --> 58:23.510
- No, I... I don't mean that.

58:23.533 --> 58:25.535
Of course, you remember it.
It's just-

58:25.568 --> 58:29.675
- The IRA planted a bomb
at a Remembrance Day parade,

58:29.706 --> 58:33.017
a parade to remember
Protestant and Catholic soldiers

58:33.042 --> 58:35.750
who fought on the same side
against great evil

58:35.778 --> 58:37.951
in two World Wars

58:37.981 --> 58:42.020
and murdered 11-
no, 12 innocent people.

58:42.051 --> 58:44.088
- I know what happened.

58:44.120 --> 58:45.758
But what I'm trying to say is-

58:45.788 --> 58:47.768
- Wesley and Bertha Armstrong.

58:47.790 --> 58:49.997
Kitchener and Jessie Johnston.

58:50.026 --> 58:52.666
William and Agnes Mullan.

58:52.695 --> 58:55.107
John Megaw, Georgina Quinton,

58:55.131 --> 58:58.977
Marie Wilson, Samuel Gault,
and Edward Armstrong.

58:59.002 --> 59:03.109
Ronnie Hill died after being
in a coma for 13 years.

59:03.139 --> 59:07.144
Yes, I remember Enniskillen.

59:07.176 --> 59:08.849
- Will you listen to me?

59:09.612 --> 59:11.114
It was a mistake, okay?

59:13.583 --> 59:16.086
It did irreparable damage
to our cause.

59:18.054 --> 59:19.727
When it was on the news...

59:21.724 --> 59:23.226
They were showing the video.

59:26.062 --> 59:29.600
They were showing...
Gordon Wilson talking

59:29.632 --> 59:32.943
about his... his poor daughter
under the rubble.

59:36.172 --> 59:37.742
And he was saying...

59:39.075 --> 59:40.884
That he bore us no ill will.

59:42.145 --> 59:43.317
He forgave us.

59:45.248 --> 59:49.890
My daughter...
she was only a wee tot.

59:52.622 --> 59:54.295
She came to me and asked

59:54.324 --> 59:57.965
why people
had to kill each other.

59:59.996 --> 01:00:01.304
And I said...

01:00:04.033 --> 01:00:05.876
"It's not good to kill anyone,

01:00:05.902 --> 01:00:09.782
but sometimes, if you believe
something so strongly"...

01:00:14.711 --> 01:00:16.213
And I heard myself sayin' it.

01:00:19.949 --> 01:00:23.829
And I could see in her eyes,
she was just...

01:00:23.853 --> 01:00:25.264
horrified...

01:00:27.757 --> 01:00:30.738
That I was trying to justify it.

01:00:33.930 --> 01:00:36.911
And I realized, uh...

01:00:36.933 --> 01:00:39.209
I was talking to her

01:00:39.235 --> 01:00:41.237
as a freedom fighter, not as...

01:00:42.805 --> 01:00:44.250
Not as a father.

01:00:47.710 --> 01:00:50.122
And I started to think,

01:00:50.146 --> 01:00:54.026
how would I feel

01:00:54.050 --> 01:00:55.859
if she was under that rubble?

01:00:59.155 --> 01:01:03.103
If she was the one I had to hold

01:01:03.126 --> 01:01:05.766
while her life ebbed away?

01:01:05.795 --> 01:01:06.933
- Martin.

01:01:08.097 --> 01:01:11.738
- And that's when
I finally understood...

01:01:13.169 --> 01:01:16.241
That things had to change.

01:01:16.272 --> 01:01:19.185
We...
that the killing had to stop.

01:01:19.208 --> 01:01:20.414
- Martin.

01:01:26.015 --> 01:01:29.121
Save me your crocodile tears.

01:01:31.020 --> 01:01:33.057
12 people were murdered.

01:01:34.190 --> 01:01:36.431
63 injured, including

01:01:36.459 --> 01:01:38.700
13 of your precious children,

01:01:38.728 --> 01:01:41.834
yet you've managed
to turn it into a tragedy

01:01:41.864 --> 01:01:44.470
about your daughter's
loss of innocence?

01:01:44.701 --> 01:01:47.204
Really? Really?

01:01:48.905 --> 01:01:51.909
Why don't you go
to those 12 grim houses

01:01:51.941 --> 01:01:55.753
and tell them your sob story?

01:01:55.778 --> 01:01:58.816
Tell them that you suffered too.

01:01:58.848 --> 01:02:02.352
That it caused your side
irreparable damage.

01:02:03.419 --> 01:02:05.262
Unbelievable.

01:02:07.957 --> 01:02:11.063
- All right, you walk away.

01:02:11.094 --> 01:02:12.732
That's what you do.

01:02:13.396 --> 01:02:15.034
You're like
the Grand Old Duke of York.

01:02:15.064 --> 01:02:16.475
You march 'em up
to the top of the hill

01:02:16.499 --> 01:02:18.740
and you march 'em down again.

01:02:18.768 --> 01:02:20.406
That's what you do with hope,

01:02:20.436 --> 01:02:23.076
you big-headed auld bigot!

01:02:48.264 --> 01:02:50.266
We need to get to the airport.

01:02:50.299 --> 01:02:52.006
- You need to get there.

01:02:54.237 --> 01:02:56.148
I'll be all right here.

01:02:57.774 --> 01:03:01.017
- Sometimes my bark
is worse than my bite.

01:03:01.043 --> 01:03:03.023
- Sometimes?

01:03:07.416 --> 01:03:11.057
- Somebody once said that
the past is a foreign country.

01:03:11.087 --> 01:03:15.058
That they-they do things
differently there.

01:03:16.125 --> 01:03:21.268
Maybe we have to learn
to do things differently.

01:03:30.840 --> 01:03:32.114
- What are you saying?

01:04:12.081 --> 01:04:13.583
- Is he sulking?

01:04:13.616 --> 01:04:15.493
It looks like he's sulking.

01:04:17.153 --> 01:04:18.564
- He feels cornered.

01:04:39.508 --> 01:04:41.488
- We're still okay
for the flight, so we are.

01:04:45.147 --> 01:04:47.457
Aren't we?
- Oh, yes, sir.

01:05:09.505 --> 01:05:11.507
- Quick as you can, all right?
- Yes.

01:05:17.246 --> 01:05:18.520
- Invalid card.

01:05:18.547 --> 01:05:21.289
- Just give me one minute.
I think I...

01:05:34.196 --> 01:05:35.698
- You'd be First Minister.

01:05:37.133 --> 01:05:38.544
I'd be Deputy.

01:05:40.069 --> 01:05:41.571
First Minister.

01:05:42.571 --> 01:05:44.175
Caesar.

01:05:44.206 --> 01:05:45.412
Kaiser.

01:05:55.284 --> 01:05:58.128
What now?
- They won't take my card.

01:05:58.154 --> 01:05:59.656
You know, the wallet
in my back pocket got bent

01:05:59.689 --> 01:06:01.464
while I was changing
the tire, so...

01:06:01.490 --> 01:06:02.696
- I'm sure if you explained
the situation-

01:06:02.725 --> 01:06:05.535
- No, he says he's not allowed.

01:06:05.561 --> 01:06:08.599
I do hate to ask,
but could I borrow your...

01:06:11.434 --> 01:06:13.414
Do you really think
any bank would trust me

01:06:13.436 --> 01:06:15.609
with a credit card, hmm?

01:06:15.638 --> 01:06:18.585
I get so far
with the application,

01:06:18.607 --> 01:06:20.280
and then it all goes bad

01:06:20.309 --> 01:06:22.653
when they see
"international terrorist."

01:06:24.213 --> 01:06:26.625
How about you, big man?
You step up?

01:06:26.649 --> 01:06:29.391
- I don't use credit cards.

01:06:29.418 --> 01:06:32.126
- Oh, right, I forgot.

01:06:32.154 --> 01:06:34.361
Moneylenders.

01:06:34.390 --> 01:06:35.767
Well, I've no cash on me.

01:06:36.993 --> 01:06:39.030
- I have a plane to catch.

01:06:41.163 --> 01:06:43.666
- This should be interesting.

01:06:47.737 --> 01:06:50.183
Do you know who I am?

01:06:50.206 --> 01:06:52.152
- Hey, Donald!

01:06:52.174 --> 01:06:54.450
There's a gentleman here
who doesn't know who he is.

01:06:54.477 --> 01:06:57.481
I'm sorry, I've been waiting
my whole life to...

01:06:58.447 --> 01:07:02.122
- Today, I have been married
for exactly 50 years

01:07:02.151 --> 01:07:04.563
to the most wonderful woman.

01:07:04.587 --> 01:07:08.626
Tonight, I'm celebrating
with her in Belfast.

01:07:08.657 --> 01:07:12.366
There's a plane waitin' for me
at Edinburgh Airport.

01:07:12.395 --> 01:07:15.501
To get that plane,
my car requires petrol.

01:07:16.565 --> 01:07:19.603
This driver's credit card
is perfectly good and valid,

01:07:19.635 --> 01:07:21.774
yet has been rejected
by your machine.

01:07:21.804 --> 01:07:25.479
You have the power
to overrule that machine

01:07:25.508 --> 01:07:27.181
and process his payment.

01:07:27.209 --> 01:07:30.156
I would like you to do that.

01:07:30.179 --> 01:07:32.750
- I-I'm-I'm afraid I can't
without authorization from-

01:07:32.782 --> 01:07:36.252
- "And Jesus went
into the temple of God

01:07:36.285 --> 01:07:38.731
"and cast out them that sold

01:07:38.754 --> 01:07:41.360
"and bought in the temple.

01:07:41.390 --> 01:07:44.633
"He overthrew the tables
of the money changers

01:07:44.660 --> 01:07:47.334
"and the seats of them
who sold doves

01:07:47.363 --> 01:07:49.639
"and said unto them,
'It is written

01:07:49.665 --> 01:07:52.646
"'my house shall be called
the house of prayer,

01:07:52.668 --> 01:07:55.410
"yet ye have made it
a den of thieves.'

01:07:55.438 --> 01:07:59.682
"And the blind and lame
came to him in the temple

01:07:59.708 --> 01:08:01.085
"and he healed them.

01:08:01.110 --> 01:08:04.353
"And when the chief priests
and scribes

01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:06.621
"saw the wonderful things
that he did

01:08:06.649 --> 01:08:09.459
"and the children crying
in the temple,

01:08:09.485 --> 01:08:12.694
“Hosanna to the son of David, '

01:08:12.721 --> 01:08:15.497
they were sore displeased!"

01:08:21.831 --> 01:08:23.537
- Maybe if I try
keyin' in the number,

01:08:23.566 --> 01:08:25.102
it might go through this time.

01:08:25.134 --> 01:08:27.410
- That would be appreciated.

01:08:35.310 --> 01:08:36.517
- Thank you.

01:08:39.615 --> 01:08:41.720
Sir, do you mind
if I ask you a question?

01:08:44.386 --> 01:08:47.299
Did you ever actually
ever kill anyone yourself?

01:08:48.457 --> 01:08:51.301
You know, pull the trigger?

01:08:51.327 --> 01:08:52.738
- No.

01:08:53.729 --> 01:08:54.867
It was a war.

01:08:56.599 --> 01:08:59.443
People die in wars,
on both sides.

01:09:00.836 --> 01:09:02.837
- I just wondered how it felt
to have people's deaths

01:09:02.872 --> 01:09:04.578
on your conscience.

01:09:05.508 --> 01:09:07.680
- Do you mean,
can I sleep at night?

01:09:09.778 --> 01:09:12.657
Yes, I sleep at night.

01:09:14.450 --> 01:09:16.361
I'm sure you do too.

01:09:16.385 --> 01:09:18.763
- Yes, I do.

01:09:18.787 --> 01:09:21.290
My conscience is clear.

01:09:22.758 --> 01:09:24.169
- Is it really?

01:09:24.894 --> 01:09:27.430
- Never even touched a gun.

01:09:27.462 --> 01:09:28.908
- Well, that may be.

01:09:30.733 --> 01:09:31.837
But the fact of the matter is,

01:09:31.867 --> 01:09:35.474
you actually started it all
in the first place.

01:09:37.273 --> 01:09:39.252
I mean, if you had joined

01:09:39.274 --> 01:09:41.255
the civil rights marchers
instead of attacking them-

01:09:41.277 --> 01:09:43.518
- It wasn't about civil rights.

01:09:44.779 --> 01:09:47.818
- Catholics were denied jobs,
houses, votes.

01:09:47.850 --> 01:09:50.330
- And I would have supported
every man jack of them

01:09:50.352 --> 01:09:51.921
if that was all it was about.

01:09:53.189 --> 01:09:55.362
Do you not think I, uh-

01:09:55.391 --> 01:09:58.964
I looked across the Atlantic
and saw Martin Luther King

01:09:59.195 --> 01:10:01.835
preaching about civil rights,

01:10:01.864 --> 01:10:03.673
fearless and brave
and determined?

01:10:03.699 --> 01:10:05.337
- You, sir, are no Doctor-

01:10:05.367 --> 01:10:07.813
- But they shot that great man.

01:10:07.836 --> 01:10:10.715
And I'd have been happy for them
to shoot me in that cause.

01:10:10.739 --> 01:10:11.979
- Well, that's bollocks.

01:10:13.475 --> 01:10:14.579
And what about Mandela?

01:10:14.610 --> 01:10:15.987
- He was another terrorist!

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:19.489
- Who embraced the peace
having been a bomber.

01:10:21.450 --> 01:10:23.691
Would you refuse
to shake his hand as well?

01:10:25.721 --> 01:10:27.530
Didn't he make a giant leap?

01:10:29.291 --> 01:10:33.706
Didn't everyone say
it was impossible?

01:10:33.729 --> 01:10:34.901
And look at him now.

01:10:35.864 --> 01:10:37.241
The world loves him.

01:10:41.337 --> 01:10:45.251
- The difference is, he had
his people behind him.

01:10:45.274 --> 01:10:47.811
- If you're the leader
I think you are...

01:10:48.944 --> 01:10:50.821
Your people will follow you too.

01:10:52.715 --> 01:10:55.355
And if you don't give a damn
what I think...

01:10:56.418 --> 01:10:57.920
Let me put it another way.

01:11:00.022 --> 01:11:02.764
If you're the leader
you think you are...

01:11:04.526 --> 01:11:06.563
Your people will follow you,
no matter what.

01:11:22.645 --> 01:11:25.353
- Oh, sorry. Mandela, eh?

01:11:25.381 --> 01:11:26.917
He was the man.

01:11:27.883 --> 01:11:29.487
Or maybe
you're more Che Guevara.

01:11:33.022 --> 01:11:35.366
- Jesus Christ.

01:11:35.391 --> 01:11:36.802
- I can explain, okay?

01:11:36.825 --> 01:11:38.736
- What the fuck is this, eh?

01:11:38.761 --> 01:11:39.967
- Nothing, nothing.
I swear, sir.

01:11:39.995 --> 01:11:41.668
- Are you supposed to-
are you supposed to kill us?

01:11:41.697 --> 01:11:43.404
Is that it, huh'?
- No, no, no, no. God, no.

01:11:43.432 --> 01:11:44.638
- Is that what this
bloody pantomime is all about?

01:11:44.667 --> 01:11:46.305
- No, no!
It's the opposite, okay?

01:11:46.335 --> 01:11:48.440
Look, look.
- Easy.

01:11:56.779 --> 01:11:58.588
- I'm here to protect you.

01:12:04.820 --> 01:12:06.527
- Then why are you
masquerading-

01:12:06.555 --> 01:12:08.091
- There is nothing sinister,
honestly.

01:12:08.324 --> 01:12:09.928
They just thought
that you might talk more freely

01:12:09.958 --> 01:12:11.335
if I wasn't a government driver.

01:12:11.360 --> 01:12:14.068
But they just put me
in this bloody Scottish patter.

01:12:14.096 --> 01:12:15.803
You think
I want to be wearing this?

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:20.812
- You Brits,
you are so fucking useless.

01:12:23.372 --> 01:12:25.409
Do you see this, big man?

01:12:26.742 --> 01:12:28.449
- Honest to God,
we-we should just get on

01:12:28.477 --> 01:12:29.979
with this peace deal ourselves

01:12:30.012 --> 01:12:33.118
and-and cut these jokers
out of it altogether!

01:12:34.550 --> 01:12:35.824
Dr. Paisley?

01:12:36.952 --> 01:12:38.556
Jesus Christ.

01:12:38.587 --> 01:12:40.863
Hey, come on, come on.
Are you okay?

01:12:40.889 --> 01:12:43.062
What happened?
Are you all right?

01:12:44.827 --> 01:12:46.738
- Ian, can you hear me?

01:12:46.762 --> 01:12:48.673
Can you hear me, Ian?

01:12:54.136 --> 01:12:56.412
Uh, pills, I forgot...

01:12:56.438 --> 01:12:57.883
- Pills?
- Pills.

01:12:57.906 --> 01:12:59.613
- Pills.
Where-where are they?

01:13:03.479 --> 01:13:04.651
Is that them?

01:13:05.981 --> 01:13:07.460
Yeah?
- That's it.

01:13:07.483 --> 01:13:08.962
- Okay, okay,
I got it, I got it.

01:13:08.984 --> 01:13:11.624
Come on.
How many do you need?

01:13:11.653 --> 01:13:12.654
- Just one.
- Just one?

01:13:12.688 --> 01:13:13.928
- One tablet.

01:13:15.591 --> 01:13:17.901
- <i>Get some water, will you?
Quick, water.</i>

01:13:19.061 --> 01:13:20.597
- He'll be okay.

01:13:22.064 --> 01:13:23.509
- What if he dies?

01:13:24.867 --> 01:13:26.813
Sorry, but what if he-

01:13:26.835 --> 01:13:28.508
- He won't.

01:13:29.571 --> 01:13:30.811
. Okay

01:13:32.975 --> 01:13:36.013
You all right now?
All right. All right.

01:13:36.044 --> 01:13:37.921
We'll get you to a hospital.

01:13:37.946 --> 01:13:39.687
- No, no. No.

01:13:41.717 --> 01:13:44.095
I'm going home.

01:13:44.119 --> 01:13:48.659
- What'?
Listen, will you wise up?

01:13:48.690 --> 01:13:51.603
- I-I'm going home.
- No, look, look!

01:13:51.627 --> 01:13:53.436
You keeled over.

01:13:53.462 --> 01:13:57.535
What-what if it happens again,
or-or somethin' worse?

01:13:58.801 --> 01:14:02.180
Who do you think will get
the blame for that, eh?

01:14:02.204 --> 01:14:04.206
I'll be lynched.

01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:07.080
- Chance would be a fine thing.

01:14:10.679 --> 01:14:12.181
I'm grand.

01:14:12.214 --> 01:14:14.455
- Okay, let's see.

01:14:17.453 --> 01:14:19.490
How far out are they?
- Just over 10 miles.

01:14:19.521 --> 01:14:21.057
About 15 minutes
in current traffic.

01:14:21.089 --> 01:14:22.830
- And what about the plane?

01:14:22.858 --> 01:14:24.098
- Well, it's been on the ground
for 40 minutes

01:14:24.126 --> 01:14:25.469
and getting to the end
of its window.

01:14:25.494 --> 01:14:26.802
The weather's closing in again.

01:14:45.781 --> 01:14:47.488
<i>- Can I ask you something?</i>

01:14:48.550 --> 01:14:50.723
What is all this, uh...

01:14:50.752 --> 01:14:56.100
"so you do,"
uh, "so it is," "so I did"?

01:14:56.124 --> 01:14:58.161
- What do you mean?

01:14:58.193 --> 01:15:00.935
- Well, you know,
the-the words.

01:15:00.963 --> 01:15:02.033
"So you do, so it is."

01:15:02.064 --> 01:15:04.066
You add them at the end
of a sentence.

01:15:04.099 --> 01:15:07.740
- It's just the way we talk
at home, so it is.

01:15:07.769 --> 01:15:11.546
- It-it's an involuntary
thing, so it is.

01:15:13.709 --> 01:15:17.179
- It's almost like we don't
expect to be believed, huh?

01:15:17.212 --> 01:15:19.852
I had lunch today, so I did.

01:15:21.884 --> 01:15:25.263
I have lunch every day.
It's not unusual, so it isn't.

01:15:30.659 --> 01:15:32.104
- What?

01:15:32.127 --> 01:15:34.698
- Well, nothing, I was, uh...

01:15:34.730 --> 01:15:37.904
I was-
I-| was just thinking

01:15:37.933 --> 01:15:40.880
about if, um, you imagine

01:15:40.903 --> 01:15:44.077
some of the most famous men
in history

01:15:44.106 --> 01:15:46.609
had been from Northern Ireland.

01:15:46.642 --> 01:15:49.088
Neil Armstrong.

01:15:49.111 --> 01:15:54.083
"That's one small step
for a man, so it is."

01:15:58.820 --> 01:15:59.924
- Right.

01:16:03.659 --> 01:16:07.732
"We will fight them
on the beaches, so we will."

01:16:07.763 --> 01:16:12.769
- "I had a dream, so I had."

01:16:23.345 --> 01:16:25.621
<i>- First Minister.</i>

01:16:25.647 --> 01:16:26.921
Caesar.

01:16:26.949 --> 01:16:28.087
<i>Kaiser.</i>

01:16:30.018 --> 01:16:33.090
<i>- We say never!</i>

01:16:33.121 --> 01:16:36.000
<i>Never! Never!</i>

01:16:37.926 --> 01:16:39.872
Pull off the road.

01:16:39.895 --> 01:16:40.965
<i>-</i> Sir?

01:16:41.797 --> 01:16:43.834
- Pull off the road.
- Stop the car.

01:16:43.865 --> 01:16:46.106
- Cutting it pretty fine
as it is, but...

01:16:46.134 --> 01:16:47.238
- Are you okay?

01:16:47.269 --> 01:16:50.011
- Just stop the car when you can

01:16:50.038 --> 01:16:51.745
as soon as you can, please!

01:16:53.041 --> 01:16:54.042
If you can.

01:16:56.211 --> 01:16:59.090
- What are they-what are
they doing? What are they-

01:17:12.995 --> 01:17:14.702
- I'd better go with him.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:22.407
- Stained glass martyrs.
I saw them when I passed out.

01:17:22.638 --> 01:17:26.108
They've shaped my life.
They've guided me in everything.

01:17:26.141 --> 01:17:31.090
I stood in defense of Ulster
and against the papish plots.

01:17:31.113 --> 01:17:33.115
I put myself in the firing line,

01:17:33.148 --> 01:17:35.822
and I thought that
that was my sacrifice,

01:17:35.851 --> 01:17:38.297
that that would be my martyrdom.

01:17:38.320 --> 01:17:41.426
And yet, I was never touched,
never harmed.

01:17:41.657 --> 01:17:43.330
No hand was laid upon me.

01:17:43.358 --> 01:17:45.998
No assassin's bullet
sought me out.

01:17:46.028 --> 01:17:49.271
I've lain in a hospital bed
at death's door

01:17:49.297 --> 01:17:51.038
and yet he would not let me go.

01:17:51.066 --> 01:17:54.138
And now, now...

01:17:54.169 --> 01:17:58.982
history contrives
to put me here with you!

01:18:00.175 --> 01:18:01.984
My mortal enemy!

01:18:02.010 --> 01:18:04.957
And I have to ask myself
if-if he has a reason.

01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:06.288
Why here?

01:18:07.249 --> 01:18:09.320
<i>Why you'? Why now?</i>

01:18:09.351 --> 01:18:12.025
Why would he ask me
to shake hands

01:18:12.054 --> 01:18:14.330
with a man like you

01:18:14.356 --> 01:18:17.394
when there has been
such incredible violence?

01:18:19.127 --> 01:18:22.108
- Because that man has changed.

01:18:22.130 --> 01:18:25.270
- How could I ever know
that it's not an act?

01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.904
A Charade?

01:18:26.935 --> 01:18:30.246
A bluff? A ploy? A...
- Listen to me!

01:18:30.272 --> 01:18:33.185
You've no reason to trust me,
and I've no reason to trust you,

01:18:33.208 --> 01:18:35.745
but we need a leap of faith,

01:18:35.777 --> 01:18:38.417
and you are all about faith.

01:18:38.447 --> 01:18:39.983
If you follow your logic,

01:18:40.015 --> 01:18:43.986
if-if God has
put you here with me,

01:18:44.019 --> 01:18:45.862
then he either means you
to kiss me or kill me,

01:18:45.887 --> 01:18:47.298
and, "Thou shalt not kill."

01:18:47.322 --> 01:18:49.461
- Don't quote scriptures at me!

01:18:53.161 --> 01:18:55.505
What's to say
you're not his final test?

01:18:57.232 --> 01:19:01.271
You're Satan
in the Judean desert

01:19:01.303 --> 01:19:03.340
tempting me with power!

01:19:03.371 --> 01:19:05.817
- Well, I am tempting you
with power.

01:19:06.875 --> 01:19:10.345
Ian, you like to be the big man
in the big picture,

01:19:10.378 --> 01:19:12.016
and don't deny it.

01:19:12.047 --> 01:19:16.325
And you will be that man
and for the right reasons.

01:19:17.152 --> 01:19:19.428
It is all about your martyrs,

01:19:19.454 --> 01:19:20.865
but you-you just
have 'em all wrong.

01:19:20.889 --> 01:19:22.835
- What do you know about...

01:19:22.858 --> 01:19:25.236
- You have been all about
protecting your past,

01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:27.763
your-your precious culture.

01:19:29.197 --> 01:19:30.870
That's not what they were doing.

01:19:31.500 --> 01:19:34.242
They weren't interested
in the past.

01:19:34.269 --> 01:19:36.044
They were interested
in the future.

01:19:37.372 --> 01:19:39.978
They were going
against the grain, not with it.

01:19:41.543 --> 01:19:45.047
Ian, the true sacrifice

01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:47.321
is in doing exactly the opposite

01:19:47.349 --> 01:19:49.795
of what you have promised
your people.

01:19:49.818 --> 01:19:52.799
Accepting
that you may burn for it.

01:19:54.322 --> 01:19:57.064
That's your blessed martyrdom.

01:20:05.167 --> 01:20:07.113
- You are the devil.

01:21:32.120 --> 01:21:33.997
- Would you like me
to give you a minute?

01:21:37.125 --> 01:21:38.331
- Thank you.

01:21:45.133 --> 01:21:47.545
- When did you realize
what he was?

01:21:47.569 --> 01:21:50.049
- From the moment
he opened his mouth.

01:21:53.241 --> 01:21:54.618
- How did you know?

01:21:56.211 --> 01:21:58.623
- Because I'm not naive.

01:21:58.647 --> 01:22:01.924
And also because he claimed
never to have heard of me.

01:22:04.252 --> 01:22:06.095
Everyone's heard of me.

01:22:10.358 --> 01:22:13.202
- Aye, that's a fact.

01:22:15.330 --> 01:22:16.331
So...

01:22:19.034 --> 01:22:20.274
Here we are.

01:22:21.336 --> 01:22:22.576
- You are right...

01:22:24.306 --> 01:22:25.546
About the martyrs.

01:22:28.176 --> 01:22:30.053
I'm an old man now.

01:22:31.479 --> 01:22:33.288
Old men can afford to be bold.

01:22:34.416 --> 01:22:38.193
Oh, what a joy it would be
to walk up those steps,

01:22:38.219 --> 01:22:43.430
to see a true man of God
sworn in as First Minister.

01:22:44.726 --> 01:22:48.606
<i>But the caveat is,
I have to do it</i>

01:22:48.630 --> 01:22:51.509
<i>with you at my side.</i>

01:22:53.268 --> 01:22:54.611
<i>And we could do this now.</i>

01:22:54.636 --> 01:22:58.243
I could offer my hand
and we could seal the peace.

01:22:58.273 --> 01:23:02.619
But first, I have to ask you
to do something.

01:23:02.644 --> 01:23:05.250
I know that you would
never do this in public.

01:23:06.481 --> 01:23:09.519
But here, in private...

01:23:13.021 --> 01:23:15.058
I would like you to apologize.

01:23:15.090 --> 01:23:17.297
<i>'</i> Apologize?

01:23:17.325 --> 01:23:20.602
- I would like you
to apologize...

01:23:20.628 --> 01:23:24.542
for all the deaths
your people have caused,

01:23:24.566 --> 01:23:28.104
for the ethnic cleansing
you've inspired,

01:23:28.136 --> 01:23:32.107
for the innocents
your people have murdered,

01:23:32.140 --> 01:23:36.486
for the bombs
that have devastated families,

01:23:36.511 --> 01:23:38.513
for the bullets that have killed

01:23:38.546 --> 01:23:43.120
sons and daughters,
fathers and mothers.

01:23:45.620 --> 01:23:47.759
I want you to say sorry.

01:23:50.458 --> 01:23:53.564
For that, we get peace.

01:24:00.468 --> 01:24:04.507
- Just... say it.

01:24:07.809 --> 01:24:11.382
- Ian Paisley, you have
run me round in circles today.

01:24:12.814 --> 01:24:15.294
And maybe that's what
this is all about.

01:24:17.452 --> 01:24:21.264
You always intended to go
one way or the other.

01:24:21.289 --> 01:24:23.166
But you just wanted your moment.

01:24:24.092 --> 01:24:26.766
The moment where
you had me in a corner,

01:24:26.795 --> 01:24:29.469
knowing that if I went down
on bended knee,

01:24:29.497 --> 01:24:31.499
I would always be
on bended knee.

01:24:33.301 --> 01:24:35.679
You just wanted
the satisfaction of that.

01:24:39.107 --> 01:24:40.609
And I could do it.

01:24:43.511 --> 01:24:45.252
But what would it really mean?

01:24:46.714 --> 01:24:49.388
Because you know

01:24:49.417 --> 01:24:51.363
<i>I</i> play a long game.

01:24:52.287 --> 01:24:54.358
And no matter
what we agree here today...

01:24:55.523 --> 01:24:57.525
It will change.

01:24:57.559 --> 01:25:01.530
It will have to change,
because we are Ireland.

01:25:02.464 --> 01:25:03.807
We are inevitable.

01:25:06.134 --> 01:25:08.307
So it should be
no skin off my nose

01:25:08.336 --> 01:25:12.546
if here, in private, I say sorry

01:25:12.574 --> 01:25:14.850
for all that's gone before,

01:25:14.876 --> 01:25:18.551
and then I get
exactly what I came for.

01:25:23.485 --> 01:25:25.431
But I will not do it.

01:25:27.856 --> 01:25:31.201
It would be a betrayal
of everything I stand for.

01:25:33.361 --> 01:25:35.500
We had a civil war.

01:25:37.799 --> 01:25:42.544
And this is our only opportunity
for both sides

01:25:42.570 --> 01:25:46.518
to walk away
with heads held high,

01:25:46.541 --> 01:25:49.488
to build something
that will last

01:25:49.511 --> 01:25:51.218
at least for our lifetimes.

01:25:54.215 --> 01:25:57.196
So...

01:25:57.218 --> 01:25:59.858
I apologize for nothing.

01:26:10.398 --> 01:26:12.742
- That's a true politician.

01:26:14.702 --> 01:26:16.579
Never apologize.

01:26:23.178 --> 01:26:28.423
I despise everything
you have done, so I do.

01:26:39.961 --> 01:26:43.431
- I despise everything
you stand for, so I do.

01:26:49.904 --> 01:26:51.747
- Bloody hell.

01:26:53.308 --> 01:26:54.480
They've done it.

01:26:55.710 --> 01:26:57.451
They've bloody done it!

01:26:59.280 --> 01:27:00.554
- Well done, sir.

01:27:16.798 --> 01:27:18.334
- Oh, that, uh...

01:27:19.367 --> 01:27:20.641
That deer.

01:27:22.003 --> 01:27:23.607
That was an accident, right?

01:27:23.638 --> 01:27:24.912
- No.

01:27:24.939 --> 01:27:26.646
We have highly trained wildlife.

01:27:29.811 --> 01:27:30.812
- Hmm.

01:27:44.792 --> 01:27:46.669
- Sir, would you care
for a biscuit?

01:27:51.432 --> 01:27:53.742
- Do you have
any wee plain ones?

01:28:53.895 --> 01:28:55.738
