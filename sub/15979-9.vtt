WEBVTT

00:06.107 --> 00:08.142
(off-key):
* Leave me alone, big bully

00:08.176 --> 00:10.311
* Leave me alone

00:10.344 --> 00:13.247
* I moan the whole day long

00:13.281 --> 00:16.350
CAROL:
She's just awful.

00:16.384 --> 00:18.252
Thank God she didn't also

00:18.286 --> 00:20.554
get Debbie's red hair.

00:20.588 --> 00:22.256
NATHAN:
Why do I come here?

00:22.290 --> 00:24.392
I have my own home.

00:24.425 --> 00:26.327
KIP:
Can a person go to jail

00:26.360 --> 00:30.298
for murdering... a song?

00:30.331 --> 00:31.699
TOM:
Wish I wore a hearing aid

00:31.732 --> 00:34.435
so I could turn it off.

00:34.468 --> 00:38.272
* Big bully,
won't you leave me alone? *

00:39.307 --> 00:41.275
Ah, that was
wonderful, Mikayla.

00:41.309 --> 00:43.644
And it only took you 16 times

00:43.677 --> 00:46.180
to almost get it right.

00:46.214 --> 00:47.815
Sure, it's still a little rough,

00:47.848 --> 00:49.717
but, uh, we needed something
for the assembly

00:49.750 --> 00:51.385
for Anti-Bullying Week.

00:51.419 --> 00:52.586
You're doing great work here.

00:52.620 --> 00:54.288
Nothing stops a kid
from getting bullied

00:54.322 --> 00:56.824
more than a bowler hat
and a cane.

00:56.857 --> 00:58.259
All right, come on, Mikayla.

00:58.292 --> 00:59.327
Let's clean up
those dance steps.

00:59.360 --> 01:00.361
You want some help?

01:00.394 --> 01:01.395
Uh, that's okay.

01:01.429 --> 01:02.296
I think we're close.

01:02.330 --> 01:03.831
His loss.

01:03.864 --> 01:06.367
I spent four years
studying dance.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.535
Oh, yeah? Where?

01:07.568 --> 01:09.103
My couch.

01:09.137 --> 01:10.771
I watched all four seasons
of Dance Moms.

01:10.804 --> 01:14.442
Plus a week-long marathon
of Dances with Wolves.

01:15.676 --> 01:18.779
So, I can teach her to dance
or kill a buffalo.

01:20.348 --> 01:23.417
So, my Aunt Louise is going
to be visiting next week.

01:23.451 --> 01:25.486
Aunt Louise, remember?

01:25.519 --> 01:27.421
She came to our family reunion.

01:27.455 --> 01:29.423
She drove a convertible...

01:29.457 --> 01:30.691
through the tug-of-war?

01:30.724 --> 01:32.760
Oh, right, yes.

01:32.793 --> 01:34.595
She dragged Cousin Tim
and his six kids

01:34.628 --> 01:37.298
all the way to the lake.

01:37.331 --> 01:39.333
They just wouldn't let go.

01:41.435 --> 01:43.204
Well, she's coming up here
for a funeral,

01:43.237 --> 01:46.574
and she has decided to make a
whole week-long trip out of it.

01:46.607 --> 01:48.409
I want you each

01:48.442 --> 01:50.778
to spend a day looking after
her so Kip and I don't have

01:50.811 --> 01:52.446
to shoulder the burden alone.

01:52.480 --> 01:54.582
What-- a whole day? Why?
I barely know her.

01:54.615 --> 01:56.817
Because it's essential that
you get to know your relatives

01:56.850 --> 01:59.287
while you're still blessed
with their presence.

01:59.320 --> 02:02.790
Plus, old people gross me out.

02:02.823 --> 02:05.359
Present company excluded, Tom.

02:06.560 --> 02:08.229
And Carol.

02:08.262 --> 02:09.330
And Nathan.

02:11.632 --> 02:14.235
It's a shame we have to spend
a whole week doing this.

02:14.268 --> 02:15.569
I mean, she's
foggy-headed enough.

02:15.603 --> 02:17.471
We could probably just
meet her at the airport,

02:17.505 --> 02:19.173
spin her around three times

02:19.207 --> 02:22.210
and put her back
on the plane.

02:22.243 --> 02:23.511
It would work.
I've always said,

02:23.544 --> 02:25.546
"Kids, please shoot me
if ever get

02:25.579 --> 02:28.882
as foggy and senile
as old Tom."

02:28.916 --> 02:31.519
I mean Louise.
Did I say "Tom"?

02:31.552 --> 02:33.421
You had a good run, Tom.

02:33.454 --> 02:35.856
Should they shoot you now
or take you in your sleep?

02:35.889 --> 02:39.560
Okay, Mikayla's gonna practice
the song a few more times.

02:39.593 --> 02:41.595
Shoot me now.

03:08.922 --> 03:10.324
I'm sorry we're so late.

03:10.358 --> 03:11.692
Somebody wouldn't let me drive

03:11.725 --> 03:12.926
under anything that might

03:12.960 --> 03:14.995
interrupt her AM radio signal.

03:15.028 --> 03:17.631
That woman sounds
like a real bitch.

03:19.867 --> 03:22.603
Yeah, why don't you have
a seat, Aunt Louise?

03:22.636 --> 03:25.639
Yeah, we were really sorry
to hear about your friend.

03:25.673 --> 03:26.974
Uh, how was the funeral?

03:27.007 --> 03:28.942
Oh, it was a big downer.

03:28.976 --> 03:30.911
Every speaker
just went on and on and on

03:30.944 --> 03:33.747
about the great things Jack did.

03:33.781 --> 03:37.351
Did you know he got
a Purple Heart in Vietnam?

03:38.886 --> 03:40.988
Turned that color
from eating too many grapes.

03:43.657 --> 03:45.726
It got me thinking.
I haven't done anything

03:45.759 --> 03:48.462
worth talking about
at my own funeral!

03:48.496 --> 03:49.763
Well, that's not
true, Aunt Louise.

03:49.797 --> 03:52.800
You've done plenty of wonderful
things that we can talk about.

03:52.833 --> 03:55.303
Oh, you think so?
Well, fine.

03:55.336 --> 03:57.305
Let's give it a whirl.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.839
I'm dead.

03:58.872 --> 04:00.007
Talk.

04:00.040 --> 04:03.711
Aunt Louise, I don't
know if we should...

04:03.744 --> 04:05.879
Start talking.

04:05.913 --> 04:07.014
Open casket.

04:07.047 --> 04:08.616
The flies are gonna come.

04:09.917 --> 04:11.819
Okay. Okay.

04:11.852 --> 04:13.321
Uh...

04:14.455 --> 04:17.925
...uh, my aunt lived her life

04:17.958 --> 04:19.627
to the fullest.

04:21.829 --> 04:23.397
Uh...

04:23.431 --> 04:26.033
she lived a very full life.

04:26.066 --> 04:27.935
Two sentences in
and you're repeating

04:27.968 --> 04:29.503
(stammers)
the generic crap

04:29.537 --> 04:31.405
you've already said.

04:31.439 --> 04:33.374
Let's hear some specifics.

04:33.407 --> 04:34.475
Who's next?

04:34.508 --> 04:35.843
Well, come on,
Aunt Louise,

04:35.876 --> 04:38.446
this isn't fair.
You can't just die like that

04:38.479 --> 04:40.948
without warning.
We weren't ready.

04:40.981 --> 04:42.983
Dead body.

04:44.685 --> 04:45.719
I'll handle the girl.

04:45.753 --> 04:47.321
Put plastic under the body.

04:47.355 --> 04:48.922
Sometimes things leak out.

04:54.795 --> 04:55.963
I'm sorry, Louise.

04:55.996 --> 04:57.898
We just don't know
anything because...

04:57.931 --> 05:00.033
Because there isn't anything.

05:00.067 --> 05:01.869
I haven't done
a single thing in my life

05:01.902 --> 05:04.071
that's worth talking about.
Excuse me.

05:04.104 --> 05:06.674
I'm going to the bathroom...

05:06.707 --> 05:08.609
where I will likely
once again fail

05:08.642 --> 05:11.078
to accomplish
anything meaningful.

05:15.616 --> 05:17.451
I feel terrible.

05:17.485 --> 05:19.853
My Aunt Louise taught me
how to ride a bike.

05:19.887 --> 05:21.689
What kind of niece am I?

05:21.722 --> 05:23.424
I hardly know the woman.

05:23.457 --> 05:24.858
You know what?

05:24.892 --> 05:26.894
This week,
I'm gonna help her achieve

05:26.927 --> 05:29.797
something worth talking about
at her funeral.

05:29.830 --> 05:31.465
You know what?
That's a great idea, Mom.

05:31.499 --> 05:33.133
Yeah, yeah, and I-I-I took
some time off work

05:33.166 --> 05:35.503
so I could spend the day
with her and-and, uh,

05:35.536 --> 05:36.637
I'll try something, too.

05:36.670 --> 05:38.071
I was halfway down the hall

05:38.105 --> 05:40.974
and forgot where I was.

05:42.075 --> 05:43.544
Carol's house, right?

05:43.577 --> 05:46.079
Oh! Oh! And my suitcase
is packed.

05:46.113 --> 05:48.081
Oh.

05:48.115 --> 05:50.784
I must've had a fun visit.

05:50.818 --> 05:53.554
This week flew by.

05:53.587 --> 05:56.457
Well, I got to get

05:56.490 --> 05:58.492
to the airport.

06:00.160 --> 06:04.164
I wouldn't want
to miss my plane.

06:04.197 --> 06:06.467
(door closes)

06:06.500 --> 06:08.035
I love her, but, God,

06:08.068 --> 06:11.038
this is tempting.

06:13.073 --> 06:14.975
So, we got
the whole day together.

06:15.008 --> 06:16.510
But only four hours if we count

06:16.544 --> 06:19.079
for your naps, snacks
and rants about immigrants.

06:19.112 --> 06:21.014
So, let's...

06:21.048 --> 06:23.150
let's figure out something
that people can remember you by.

06:23.183 --> 06:25.586
Is there something
that you've always dreamed about

06:25.619 --> 06:26.987
but never had a chance to try?

06:27.020 --> 06:29.490
I always wanted to sing

06:29.523 --> 06:31.124
in front of a crowd.

06:31.158 --> 06:33.594
The problem is
I only know one song.

06:35.596 --> 06:38.766
* Oh, say can you see

06:38.799 --> 06:42.169
* By the dawn's early light?

06:42.202 --> 06:44.538
The song is the national anthem.

06:46.139 --> 06:47.007
In case you...
No, I...

06:47.040 --> 06:49.009
I pieced it together.
So, uh, well...

06:49.042 --> 06:52.179
what-what if you sang
at a sporting event?

06:52.212 --> 06:54.181
What, like, at the Super Bowl?

06:54.214 --> 06:55.949
I could flash a nipple.

06:58.952 --> 07:00.120
Obviously, can't do that.

07:00.153 --> 07:01.154
But you know, um,
(clears throat)

07:01.188 --> 07:03.023
Leesburg does have
a minor league hockey team.

07:03.056 --> 07:04.825
The Fightin' Titans, right?

07:04.858 --> 07:06.660
And-and, uh,
we have a connection.

07:06.694 --> 07:08.729
Their star player Igor Yasin

07:08.762 --> 07:10.764
works out at Ray's gym.

07:10.798 --> 07:12.099
Oh, I can't just walk up on him
and bother him

07:12.132 --> 07:13.901
while he's working out.

07:13.934 --> 07:15.869
I mean, that guy...
I don't want to get him mad.

07:15.903 --> 07:17.170
I've seen Rocky IV.

07:17.204 --> 07:20.140
I know what happens
to the black friend.

07:20.173 --> 07:22.543
Of course, you can't go talk
to him, but I can.

07:22.576 --> 07:23.977
We're both celebrities.

07:25.546 --> 07:27.147
Local celebrities.
I mean, you know?

07:27.180 --> 07:28.782
Come on, minor league athletes,

07:28.816 --> 07:31.051
local newscasters,
bus bench Realtors.

07:31.084 --> 07:33.621
Basically anybody
who's ever been told,

07:33.654 --> 07:36.690
"Hey, you're that guy
from that thing."

07:36.724 --> 07:38.025
I've always been curious,

07:38.058 --> 07:40.227
uh, about hockey.

07:40.260 --> 07:41.729
I never played it.

07:41.762 --> 07:43.664
But, uh, we did play a fun game,

07:43.697 --> 07:46.033
uh, on a tuna boat
that I worked on.

07:46.066 --> 07:47.901
You, uh, you worked
on a tuna boat?

07:47.935 --> 07:49.570
Well, I was a cook.

07:49.603 --> 07:53.541
The skipper had a nephew
with no legs.

07:53.574 --> 07:55.643
Tough little guy.

07:55.676 --> 07:58.712
He'd slide around the deck
every time it got icy.

08:01.048 --> 08:02.950
Five of us would stand
on each side of the boat,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.185
and we'd use our mops
to try to make sure

08:05.218 --> 08:08.121
that he didn't slide
under the rail.

08:10.190 --> 08:12.826
That's, uh, that actually
sounds a lot like hockey.

08:12.860 --> 08:14.194
I guess you're right.

08:14.227 --> 08:16.964
Uh, un-unfortunately,
somewhere off the coast

08:16.997 --> 08:20.834
of Nova Scotia,
my team lost one to nothing.

08:22.703 --> 08:25.272
The skipper was not pleased.

08:31.879 --> 08:33.781
Hey.
Oh.

08:33.814 --> 08:36.316
There's Igor over there doing
his weird pregame ritual.

08:36.349 --> 08:39.086
He only counts in
Police Academy movies.

08:39.119 --> 08:40.921
(Russian accent):
Police Academy 1.

08:40.954 --> 08:43.891
Police Academy 2:
Their First Assignment.

08:43.924 --> 08:46.994
Police Academy 3:
Back in Training.

08:47.027 --> 08:49.229
Police Academy 4:
Citizens on Patrol.

08:49.262 --> 08:51.264
Oh, man.

08:53.266 --> 08:55.168
Exercise, huh?

08:55.202 --> 08:56.704
Tell me about it.
Hey, listen.

08:56.737 --> 08:58.572
My great aunt would love
to sing the national anthem

08:58.606 --> 08:59.973
at one of your games
and I was thinking

09:00.007 --> 09:01.609
that maybe you could talk
to your owner?

09:01.642 --> 09:03.143
Please, don't bother Igor.

09:03.176 --> 09:05.713
I get it-- fans wanting
to talk to you is a drag.

09:05.746 --> 09:08.181
But I figured since I'm also
a local celebrity...

09:08.215 --> 09:11.118
"A local celebrity" how?

09:11.151 --> 09:13.587
You are popular dentist
with billboard?

09:13.621 --> 09:15.255
No.

09:15.288 --> 09:18.058
Nathan Miller, news reporter?

09:18.091 --> 09:19.893
WXDN?

09:19.927 --> 09:21.762
I-I walk your streets?

09:21.795 --> 09:23.731
Oh, you did report

09:23.764 --> 09:26.767
where you're bitten
by Easter Bunny!

09:28.401 --> 09:30.203
Right, right. Yeah.

09:30.237 --> 09:32.172
You scream, scare rabbit.

09:32.205 --> 09:34.207
Almost cry.

09:34.241 --> 09:36.309
Well, I was... I was playing it
up for the kids, man.

09:36.343 --> 09:37.978
The-the point is

09:38.011 --> 09:40.113
we're both in the same
local celebrity club.

09:40.147 --> 09:43.183
No. I am B-level
local celebrity.

09:43.216 --> 09:46.754
You are C minus, maybe not even.

09:48.656 --> 09:50.891
You are just Leesburg famous.

09:50.924 --> 09:54.227
I get free carwash from here
to Mount Vernon.

09:54.261 --> 09:56.196
Hey, listen, man.
I've got voice mails saved

09:56.229 --> 09:59.800
on this phone from Jane Pauley
and Andre 3000's mother.

09:59.833 --> 10:01.301
And you can hear Andre
in the background.

10:01.334 --> 10:03.003
I think they're on a bus.

10:03.036 --> 10:04.204
Here, I'm gonna play it
for you right now.

10:04.237 --> 10:06.273
CAROL: Nathan, it's Mom.
No, no...

10:06.306 --> 10:08.108
What did the doctor say
about your mole?

10:08.141 --> 10:09.743
Hold on, wrong one...

10:09.777 --> 10:11.211
Excuse me, I must finish

10:11.244 --> 10:14.314
pregame routine
with naked shower.

10:20.187 --> 10:21.221
How'd it go, big baller?

10:21.254 --> 10:24.157
Just a little, little hiccup,
but I'll be fine.

10:24.191 --> 10:26.293
I won't take nyet for an answer.

10:30.430 --> 10:33.133
* Put right foot in

10:33.166 --> 10:35.135
* Put right foot out

10:35.168 --> 10:37.137
* Put right foot in

10:37.170 --> 10:39.139
* Shake it all about

10:39.172 --> 10:42.810
* Do the Hockey Puckey
and turn self around *

10:42.843 --> 10:45.212
That is what is all about.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.080
* Put left foot in

10:47.114 --> 10:48.348
* Put the left...

10:48.381 --> 10:50.017
* Oh, say, can you see

10:50.050 --> 10:54.254
* By... the dawn's
early light *

10:54.287 --> 10:55.155
She promised
to cover her eyes.

10:55.188 --> 10:57.390
I just wanted you to see
how great she was.

10:57.424 --> 11:00.060
You ruin pregame routine.

11:00.093 --> 11:03.230
Now I must start Hockey Puckey
all over again.

11:03.263 --> 11:06.266
Ooh, I'd like to
hammer that sickle.

11:14.441 --> 11:17.277
What were you
thinking, Nathan?

11:17.310 --> 11:19.446
Trying to get her to sing
at a pro hockey game?

11:19.479 --> 11:22.315
People need to reach
for attainable goals.

11:22.349 --> 11:23.383
Exactly.

11:23.416 --> 11:26.954
That's why my celebrity crush
is Paul Giamatti.

11:26.987 --> 11:29.790
Mom, you don't know anything
about attainable goals.

11:29.823 --> 11:31.792
You're the one
who told me to ask out

11:31.825 --> 11:33.794
that hot bank manager
with the hook hand.

11:33.827 --> 11:37.430
And she gave me
what I think was the finger.

11:37.464 --> 11:38.766
Could have been a thumbs up.

11:38.799 --> 11:40.433
Oh, my God, you're right.

11:40.467 --> 11:41.769
Hang on, I'll be right back.

11:45.005 --> 11:47.274
We're gonna do
something easy.

11:47.307 --> 11:49.176
Oh.

11:49.209 --> 11:52.112
Aunt Louise, we're gonna shoot
a video and make you famous.

11:52.145 --> 11:55.115
(chuckling):
Okay.

11:55.148 --> 11:57.450
I guess I'd be up
for a sex tape.

12:01.021 --> 12:03.023
It's not a sex tape.

12:03.056 --> 12:05.025
Oh, no, it's in my head.

12:05.058 --> 12:07.060
The damage has been done.

12:08.996 --> 12:11.298
Aunt Louise, we're gonna make
an instructional video

12:11.331 --> 12:12.432
for the Internet.

12:12.465 --> 12:14.134
They're very popular.

12:14.167 --> 12:16.303
I was very popular.

12:16.336 --> 12:18.505
I was the most popular
woman in Arizona.

12:18.538 --> 12:21.741
Till that other
bitch moved in.

12:23.310 --> 12:25.112
I'm telling you--
you can make a video

12:25.145 --> 12:27.280
that millions
of people could watch

12:27.314 --> 12:29.416
and that would be something
for people to remember you by.

12:29.449 --> 12:32.485
It just has to be
interesting and exciting.

12:32.519 --> 12:35.488
I could teach people how
to make a pill organizer

12:35.522 --> 12:37.390
out of an
ice cube tray.

12:42.963 --> 12:45.432
Well, then film me having
sex with that black guy.

12:49.970 --> 12:52.105
The ice cube tray
is great.

12:52.139 --> 12:53.841
Yeah.

12:55.008 --> 12:56.443
Hi, I'm Louise.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.311
And I'm going to teach you...

12:58.345 --> 12:59.312
CAROL:
No, Aunt Louise,

12:59.346 --> 13:00.447
point at the camera,
not at Kip.

13:00.480 --> 13:02.149
And I'm going to teach you...

13:02.182 --> 13:03.516
Cut!

13:03.550 --> 13:05.518
And then the Cambodians moved in

13:05.552 --> 13:07.487
and made every porch look
like a shoe store.

13:07.520 --> 13:09.389
Cut.

13:09.422 --> 13:11.524
In today's video,
you're gonna learn

13:11.558 --> 13:14.427
how to take a simple
ice tray like this...

13:14.461 --> 13:16.429
And turn it into this.

13:16.463 --> 13:17.430
Oh.

13:17.464 --> 13:18.365
Cut.

13:18.398 --> 13:20.934
And once you've labeled
the plastic wrap,

13:20.968 --> 13:23.270
you wrap it
over the ice cube tray,

13:23.303 --> 13:25.405
with the days corresponding
to the correct molds,

13:25.438 --> 13:27.274
and voilà!

13:27.307 --> 13:29.409
No more accidental overdoses

13:29.442 --> 13:31.411
or unpredictable erections.

13:31.444 --> 13:34.214
Are we done, yet?

13:39.586 --> 13:41.421
I like a little
honey in my tea.

13:41.454 --> 13:42.489
You got any?

13:42.522 --> 13:43.924
Let me check.

13:43.957 --> 13:46.126
Hey, quick question
for you.

13:46.159 --> 13:49.062
What age did you start
getting foggy-headed?

13:49.096 --> 13:52.565
I'll tell you
when it happens.

13:52.599 --> 13:54.601
I'm still sharp
as a tack.

13:58.038 --> 14:00.007
Mmm.

14:00.040 --> 14:02.042
I like a little
honey in my tea.

14:03.610 --> 14:04.511
You got any?

14:04.544 --> 14:06.379
Let me check.

14:06.413 --> 14:07.514
Hey, quick question for you.

14:09.182 --> 14:12.452
What age did you start
getting foggy-headed?

14:13.486 --> 14:14.587
Where is she?

14:14.621 --> 14:16.389
Aunt Louise, get out
here, great news!

14:16.423 --> 14:17.657
Did you get a thumbs up
from hook-hand?

14:17.690 --> 14:19.559
No, I was right,
it was the finger.

14:20.227 --> 14:21.628
Hey, congratulations!

14:21.661 --> 14:22.963
You're singing
the national anthem

14:22.996 --> 14:24.297
at tomorrow's
Fightin' Titans game!

14:24.331 --> 14:26.033
Oh!

14:26.066 --> 14:27.901
The night Louise sang
to him in the shower,

14:27.935 --> 14:29.402
Igor had the game of his life.

14:29.436 --> 14:30.904
Now he thinks Louise
is good luck.

14:30.938 --> 14:32.639
Can she even sing?

14:32.672 --> 14:33.606
Oh, she's great.

14:33.640 --> 14:35.608
Yeah, yeah, show
her, Louise.

14:35.642 --> 14:38.478
* Oh, say,
can you see *

14:38.511 --> 14:41.614
* By the dawn's
early light *

14:41.648 --> 14:44.651
* The rockets
we light... *

14:47.520 --> 14:48.922
Wait, that's wrong.
Yeah.

14:48.956 --> 14:50.190
Uh, * What so
proud... *

14:50.223 --> 14:51.191
I got it, I got it.

14:51.224 --> 14:54.227
* What so proudly
we sing... *

14:55.695 --> 14:57.897
* What the hell
are the words? *

14:59.599 --> 15:02.269
Uh, listen, uh, y-you got
to sing tomorrow night.

15:02.302 --> 15:04.437
D-Do you think you can
remember the words by then?

15:04.471 --> 15:06.606
(chuckling):
Of course I could.

15:06.639 --> 15:08.675
Remember the words
to what?

15:08.708 --> 15:11.411
Good Lord, the national anthem.

15:11.444 --> 15:13.947
Maybe we should make her
cue cards.

15:13.981 --> 15:15.949
Oh, uh, they'd
have to be huge.

15:15.983 --> 15:18.118
My eyes aren't what
they used to be.

15:18.151 --> 15:19.586
I've been in this house
for three days,

15:19.619 --> 15:22.589
I still can't find
the bathroom.

15:22.622 --> 15:24.591
You're gonna want
to buy a new hamper.

15:29.162 --> 15:30.697
Ladies and gentlemen.

15:30.730 --> 15:32.699
I can no longer sit
on the sidelines

15:32.732 --> 15:34.601
and watch poor Mikayla suffer
through her dance routine.

15:34.634 --> 15:35.602
So we got together...

15:35.635 --> 15:37.670
Kip, Kip, Kip.

15:37.704 --> 15:39.106
W-We're kind of in the
middle of something.

15:39.139 --> 15:42.109
Yeah, me, too.

15:42.142 --> 15:44.277
You think I enjoy
spending my free time

15:44.311 --> 15:46.379
helping a little girl learn
how to sing and dance?

15:46.413 --> 15:48.448
ALL:
Yes.

15:48.481 --> 15:50.450
Exactly.

15:50.483 --> 15:52.519
So shut up
and let me enjoy it.

15:55.355 --> 15:57.357
(piano plays "(Won't You
Come Home) Bill Bailey")

15:59.492 --> 16:02.629
* Leave me alone, big bully

16:02.662 --> 16:04.564
* Leave me alone...

16:04.597 --> 16:07.100
Wow, she's
really good.

16:07.134 --> 16:10.403
I'm gonna put her picture
back in my wallet.

16:10.437 --> 16:12.072
* Take all my lunch money

16:12.105 --> 16:13.773
* You call me names

16:13.806 --> 16:17.744
* I'm here to tell
you that is wrong *

16:19.112 --> 16:20.713
* Remember people's
feelings *

16:20.747 --> 16:22.749
* They can get hurt

16:22.782 --> 16:24.084
* When nothing...

16:24.117 --> 16:25.752
Mikayla, stop, stop, stop, stop.

16:25.785 --> 16:27.420
You guys, don't look at me.

16:27.454 --> 16:29.422
I'm only helping her because
she couldn't remember anything,

16:29.456 --> 16:30.990
so I'm acting out the cues.

16:42.169 --> 16:43.703
Do you think it would work?

16:43.736 --> 16:45.705
We've got 24 hours to practice.

16:45.738 --> 16:47.507
It's worth a shot.

16:47.540 --> 16:49.676
Debbie, get my arts
and crafts supplies.

16:49.709 --> 16:51.511
Mikayla, grab all your toys.

16:51.544 --> 16:54.214
Adam, go steal
the flag from the bank.

16:55.448 --> 16:59.186
We're gonna help an old lady
remember a song.

16:59.219 --> 17:02.355
* Whose broad stripes
and bright stars *

17:02.389 --> 17:05.192
* Through the perilous fight

17:05.225 --> 17:08.195
* O'er the ramparts we watched

17:08.228 --> 17:12.365
* Were so gallantly streaming?

17:12.399 --> 17:15.368
* And the rockets' red glare

17:15.402 --> 17:18.205
* The bombs bursting in air

17:18.238 --> 17:20.673
* Gave proof through the night

17:20.707 --> 17:24.377
* That our flag was
still there *

17:24.411 --> 17:29.516
* Oh, say does
that star-spangled *

17:29.549 --> 17:33.553
* Banner yet wave

17:33.586 --> 17:38.558
* O'er the land of the free...

17:38.591 --> 17:41.561
* And the home

17:41.594 --> 17:45.565
* Of the brave...?

17:45.598 --> 17:47.567
That was amazing.

17:47.600 --> 17:50.603
I am proud to be an American.

17:54.807 --> 17:57.777
CAROL:
Okay, everyone, in your places.

17:57.810 --> 18:01.181
Do you all have
your stuff?

18:01.214 --> 18:02.682
This is so exciting.

18:02.715 --> 18:04.817
Louise is finally gonna get
to sing in front of thousands.

18:04.851 --> 18:06.553
Hundreds.

18:07.720 --> 18:09.822
Good few dozen people.

18:09.856 --> 18:11.858
ANNOUNCER:
And now please rise

18:11.891 --> 18:13.860
for the singing
of our national anthem

18:13.893 --> 18:16.863
by 86-year-old Louise Ferber.

18:16.896 --> 18:19.732
(cheering enthusiastically)

18:19.766 --> 18:23.102
I don't know when
I've seen her this happy.

18:23.903 --> 18:26.273
Break a leg, Aunt Louise!

18:28.841 --> 18:30.443
(screams)

18:33.380 --> 18:35.515
* And the home

18:35.548 --> 18:39.519
* Of the...

18:39.552 --> 18:40.687
* Bra...

18:40.720 --> 18:42.722
Call an ambulance.

18:49.596 --> 18:51.898
Aunt Louise,
that was amazing.

18:51.931 --> 18:54.867
The way you sang the whole song
without missing a word.

18:54.901 --> 18:57.570
And that standing ovation.

18:57.604 --> 18:59.572
Nice try.

18:59.606 --> 19:02.242
But I remember everything.

19:02.275 --> 19:04.411
Right down to them bringing
that dog out on the ice

19:04.444 --> 19:07.380
to bark the national anthem
in my place.

19:10.417 --> 19:11.718
I'm surprised she fell.

19:11.751 --> 19:13.853
She spent two months
working on an icy tuna boat.

19:13.886 --> 19:15.822
Maybe that's why she
moved to Arizona.

19:15.855 --> 19:19.692
Apparently, she was
the first woman to live there.

19:19.726 --> 19:21.828
I-I didn't know
any of that stuff,

19:21.861 --> 19:23.830
but she told me
she once won the lottery.

19:23.863 --> 19:26.366
But she left the check
on the roof of her car,

19:26.399 --> 19:27.834
and they wouldn't
reissue it.

19:27.867 --> 19:32.839
She told me she once drove a car
through a family reunion.

19:32.872 --> 19:34.541
Dad, that was ours.

19:34.574 --> 19:36.709
You were one
of the people she hit.

19:37.877 --> 19:39.846
Oh, man.

19:39.879 --> 19:43.250
Time to schedule
the MRI.

19:43.283 --> 19:46.853
Did you know she got lost in
the Grand Canyon for two days?

19:46.886 --> 19:48.888
Something about
eating bad mushrooms.

19:52.625 --> 19:56.229
I didn't quite
understand it.

19:56.263 --> 19:58.565
You know that
famous picture

19:58.598 --> 20:01.401
of the sailor kissing that
woman in Times Square?

20:01.434 --> 20:03.903
She told me that she
kissed that same woman.

20:06.038 --> 20:08.275
Now, this is a funeral.

20:08.308 --> 20:12.279
Four days ago, you couldn't come
up with one specific about me.

20:12.312 --> 20:15.448
Now you're all
talking up a storm.

20:15.482 --> 20:17.484
They're psychedelic
mushrooms.

20:23.990 --> 20:25.858
Google it.

20:30.397 --> 20:32.365
Yeah, but these are things
you've already done.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.401
We thought you wanted
to achieve something special.

20:34.434 --> 20:35.868
Who's to say
what's special?

20:35.902 --> 20:38.738
Your family learning
who you are,

20:38.771 --> 20:41.874
and knowing they'll
remember you forever.

20:41.908 --> 20:44.411
That's special
enough for me.

20:44.444 --> 20:47.046
We'll sure remember you,
Aunt Louise.

20:47.079 --> 20:48.581
And we'll make sure

20:48.615 --> 20:50.550
that everyone else knows
who you were, too.

20:50.583 --> 20:52.785
I love it!

20:52.819 --> 20:55.955
Gonna be the best funeral
Tempe, Arizona, ever had.

20:57.857 --> 20:58.958
Tempe?

20:58.991 --> 21:01.961
That's a... that's
a pricy plane ticket.

21:01.994 --> 21:04.497
Do we... do we
all have to go?

21:04.531 --> 21:07.767
One-one person could
tell her stories, right?

21:07.800 --> 21:10.803
CAROL: Let's draw straws.
NATE: Yeah.
