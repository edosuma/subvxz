[acoustic guitar playing]

00:17.970 --> 00:23.306
Sometimes I don ’t know where
777/5 dirty road /3' tak/hg me

00:24.890 --> 00:29.566
Sometimes .7 don ’1‘ even know
The reason why

00:30.280 --> 00:32.737
I guess I keep on gamb/ln’

00:32.820 --> 00:35.857
Lots of booze and lots of ramb/l'n ’

00:38.120 --> 00:42.659
Well, it’s easier than just
A-waitin ’ ’rouno’ to die

00:46.330 --> 00:51.791
One-time, friends, I had a ma
I even had a pa

00:53.090 --> 00:57.254
He beat her with a belt once
’Cause she cried

00:58.260 --> 01:03.550
She told mm to take care of me
She headed down to Tennessee

01:06.520 --> 01:09.808
Well, it’s easier than just
A-waitin ’ ’round to die

01:12.570 --> 01:13.980
You work for Mercer Lumber?

01:14.070 --> 01:16.061
-[driver] That's what it says.
-[man] Out of the truck.

01:16.150 --> 01:17.447
[driver] I can hear you.

01:17.530 --> 01:19.066
[man] I said, "Out of the truck."

01:21.280 --> 01:22.827
In front of the truck. On the ground.

01:24.830 --> 01:26.400
On the ground. Face down.

01:29.080 --> 01:31.958
-Give Mercer a message for me.
-What is it?

01:34.170 --> 01:35.250
[screams]

01:35.340 --> 01:38.298
. . . we ’re gonna wait around and die

01:39.590 --> 01:43.629
Yeah, together we ’re gonna wait around
And die

01:47.600 --> 01:49.591
[indistinct chatter on TV]

01:52.610 --> 01:54.521
[Marty] I don't understand.
I thought we had a deal.

01:57.150 --> 02:00.199
Well, what's it gonna take
for the other offer to disappear?

02:01.740 --> 02:03.446
I can do 50 more. That's it.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.743
Okay, great. I'll drive there today
with the down payment.

02:08.960 --> 02:11.838
Yes, in cash.
Just no more surprises, okay?

02:12.340 --> 02:13.955
Yup, thank you.

02:14.800 --> 02:18.292
It's so hard doing business
when you can't trust anyone.

02:19.430 --> 02:20.294
Hello.

02:21.260 --> 02:22.887
Sorry, I didn't sleep well.

02:22.970 --> 02:25.712
We are now the proud owners
of the
Missouri Bel/e.

02:26.680 --> 02:27.806
You bought a boat?

02:28.390 --> 02:32.850
It's a paddle wheeler. It's cheaper
and faster than building an actual casino.

02:33.440 --> 02:36.523
-The casino's gonna be on a boat.
-[Marty] It's gotta be on the river.

02:36.860 --> 02:39.442
-Slots.
-What's that?

02:39.530 --> 02:41.816
88% of casino revenue is slots.

02:41.910 --> 02:44.026
It's kind of boring,
but it's where the money is.

02:45.620 --> 02:47.497
Okay, good to know. Thank you.

02:48.000 --> 02:50.241
You know, the bill hasn't even passed yet.

02:50.920 --> 02:52.490
I'm counting on you and Wilkes for that.

02:53.250 --> 02:54.239
We should wait.

02:54.340 --> 02:56.160
Maybe not gamble away that money
on a boat.

02:56.420 --> 02:58.797
There's no more maybes.
This bill's gotta pass.

02:59.170 --> 03:00.501
[man on TV]
Missouri needs many things.

03:00.590 --> 03:04.424
-What's for breakfast?
-I've gotta get going. Ask your father.

03:05.720 --> 03:08.883
[man]
What Missouri doesn ’1' need
/5 another cas/no.

03:08.980 --> 03:10.129
[Marty] God damn it.

03:10.480 --> 03:11.936
They've been running this for weeks.

03:12.400 --> 03:15.608
-[Wendy] That's what we're up against.
-And when is the vote?

03:16.110 --> 03:19.147
Forty-eight hours. There's food
in the fridge,but you'll have to nuke it.

03:19.240 --> 03:20.810
I'll be in Jeff City late.

03:21.320 --> 03:24.448
I have swim practice after school.
Who's gonna pick me up?

03:24.530 --> 03:26.612
-[Wendy] Ask your father.
-[Charlotte] Dad?

03:26.700 --> 03:29.612
Take Buddy's car.
Just bring it back in one piece.

03:29.700 --> 03:31.361
Without an adult? You sure?

03:31.460 --> 03:32.666
I'm not.

03:32.750 --> 03:35.036
Charlotte, I gotta be
in Cape Girardeau,

03:35.130 --> 03:40.250
and I gotta get to the office now.
So, take Buddy's car to school and back.

03:40.880 --> 03:41.710
No detours.

03:42.220 --> 03:44.506
-[Jonah] What's for breakfast?
-[Marty] Ask your sister.

03:44.640 --> 03:47.598
No. No.

03:55.400 --> 03:58.062
[Three] Injuns say that they got
their markings

03:58.150 --> 04:01.734
from falling ash, like, from a bonfire.

04:02.650 --> 04:05.699
-Think it's true?
-I don't know. Where'd you hear it?

04:05.780 --> 04:06.940
Wyatt read it in a book.

04:07.740 --> 04:09.401
Wyatt's still sleeping up there?

04:09.490 --> 04:12.573
He's been doing it since Dad died.
You going somewhere special?

04:13.330 --> 04:14.240
[Ruth] The office.

04:14.330 --> 04:15.661
[man sighs]

04:16.580 --> 04:17.706
[Ruth] Can I help you?

04:19.550 --> 04:21.256
I'm looking for Cade Langmore.

04:21.840 --> 04:23.330
What's your business with him?

04:24.090 --> 04:27.298
I'm his parole ofﬁcer. Ronald Swale.

04:28.010 --> 04:28.840
Ruth.

04:28.930 --> 04:32.263
Hey, good morning. Sorry. I was sleepin'.
-[Swale] I thought we said seven am.
-I gotta get myself an alarm clock.

04:37.110 --> 04:39.601
I'm checking on you
to see how you're adjusting.

04:39.690 --> 04:44.559
Yeah, it's good to sleep in a real bed.
And my family has been a blessing.

04:46.240 --> 04:47.559
This your daughter?

04:47.660 --> 04:49.321
You've seen the resemblance?

04:50.160 --> 04:52.902
Should we get it over with? You got a cup?

04:59.630 --> 05:02.007
Uh, sorry, but I gotta watch.

05:03.840 --> 05:05.330
'Course you do.

05:10.260 --> 05:11.306
So...

05:12.890 --> 05:14.221
How you doing getting employment?

05:14.930 --> 05:17.307
Well... [sighs] I'm workin' on it.

05:17.400 --> 05:19.891
The job market, it's a tight one.

05:20.480 --> 05:22.641
My boss might have an opening
at the Blue Cat Lodge.

05:25.070 --> 05:26.276
[urinating]

05:26.360 --> 05:30.649
All right, well, you do need to get a job
by the next time I'm here.

05:32.370 --> 05:33.906
Yes, sir, Swale.

05:34.660 --> 05:35.786
You bet.

05:36.710 --> 05:38.610
[urinating continues]

05:38.710 --> 05:39.699
[Swale grunts]

05:39.790 --> 05:42.088
[urinating continues]

05:48.050 --> 05:49.426
Okay. Four.

05:49.890 --> 05:51.505
You need to turn four.

05:51.600 --> 05:54.421
If I have to do all the heaw lifting,
then why do I need you?

05:54.520 --> 05:56.010
I'll be delivering the rest.

05:56.100 --> 05:57.761
Of all the guys who don't hate your guts?

05:57.850 --> 06:01.354
[chuckles] You think I'm an evil
right-wing capitalist,

06:01.440 --> 06:02.896
but I believe in the causes I back.

06:03.730 --> 06:06.483
If you were in Chicago,
I would fight you tooth and nail.

06:06.990 --> 06:08.730
And you'd lose. [chuckles]

06:08.820 --> 06:11.061
-[Wendy] I'd wipe the floor with you.
-[chuckling] Yeah.

06:12.530 --> 06:13.519
[Wilkes sighs]

06:14.580 --> 06:17.151
I assume you have oppo research
on these guys.

06:19.920 --> 06:20.739
Jim.

06:22.380 --> 06:24.587
-Yeah.
-[Wilkes] Bring in the files.

06:25.460 --> 06:26.415
[Jim] You sure?

06:26.590 --> 06:28.046
[Wilkes] Yeah, I'm sure.

06:30.260 --> 06:31.966
He's very protective of me.

06:32.050 --> 06:33.540
What you're about to see

06:33.640 --> 06:35.926
is what we have on the undecideds and nos.

06:36.520 --> 06:40.092
It's thorough, detailed,
and, obviously, highly confidential.

06:41.560 --> 06:42.390
Thanks, Jim.

06:47.780 --> 06:50.408
-[Wilkes] I know. It's a lot.
-Please.

06:51.240 --> 06:53.401
-In Chicago, this would be baby steps.
-[Wilkes chuckles]

06:53.990 --> 06:55.901
They're all gonna be
at the prayer luncheon today.

07:02.540 --> 07:05.031
[Marty] I don't understand
what you want me to do.

07:06.050 --> 07:08.621
[He/en on phone]
You need
to get the h/l/h/llies under control

07:08.710 --> 07:11.508
I'm an investment adviser.
I don't strong-arm people.

07:11.590 --> 07:15.549
I don't care how you do it.
But they're jamming up the transfer.

07:15.640 --> 07:19.383
Okay, I got it. I 7/ head down there,
and I 7/ see what the holdup is.

07:19.480 --> 07:20.799
Do better than that.

07:20.890 --> 07:22.551
If we don't get this working,

07:22.650 --> 07:26.142
my client might decide this whole
operation just isn't worth the trouble.

07:26.230 --> 07:27.219
Okay, goodbye.

07:30.320 --> 07:31.355
We'll see.

07:38.870 --> 07:40.076
-Ruth.
-Yeah?

07:40.160 --> 07:41.149
Come here for a second?

07:41.710 --> 07:44.122
Go to Cape Girardeau
and finalize a deal for us.

07:44.210 --> 07:45.325
We just bought a paddle wheeler.

07:45.420 --> 07:47.331
[Ruth] I don't know fuck all
about paddle wheelers.

07:47.420 --> 07:49.627
It's a boat. If it floats, it's fine.

07:49.710 --> 07:52.008
Get it upriver and clock it
at Bagnell, okay?

07:52.090 --> 07:53.921
How am I supposed to do that?

07:54.010 --> 07:55.045
I don't know. I don't care.

07:55.140 --> 07:56.846
You said you wanted
some more responsibility,

07:56.930 --> 07:59.171
and this is what responsibility
looks like.

07:59.270 --> 08:04.094
The fellow's name is Devereaux,
I think, and give him this.

08:05.480 --> 08:08.222
Tell him I'm gonna wire the rest.
You understand?

08:09.980 --> 08:11.390
-Say yes or no.
-Yeah.

08:38.800 --> 08:40.768
[in Spanish] Hello... Hello, friend.

08:41.430 --> 08:42.727
Helen sent me.

08:42.810 --> 08:44.801
[in English] Um. Just... [in Spanish] Please wait.

08:48.560 --> 08:51.028
[in English] These people have
no fucking manners.

08:51.780 --> 08:53.816
Yeah. Just hang on one second.

09:01.290 --> 09:02.188
Hi, there.

09:05.620 --> 09:06.780
What's the problem?

09:09.040 --> 09:10.450
[Jacob] We ain't got no problem.

09:10.550 --> 09:13.963
Then, what's their problem?
The product is not being loaded.

09:15.130 --> 09:16.540
Maybe they're lazy.

09:19.100 --> 09:21.500
Look, um, you have a product.

09:21.600 --> 09:24.672
You have no means of distribution.
They have demand, but no product.

09:24.770 --> 09:28.649
That's... That's market equilibrium.
Yin yang. Ebony and ivory.

09:29.150 --> 09:30.970
Tell me what the fucking problem is.

09:31.690 --> 09:32.645
[Jacob] Trust.

09:33.650 --> 09:35.311
-Trust?
-Trust.

09:37.320 --> 09:39.618
We told them the heroin was pure.

09:40.280 --> 09:44.034
That wasn't good enough for them. Trust.

09:44.620 --> 09:49.785
Right, well... they brought you the money,
right? Did you count it?

09:50.630 --> 09:51.995
My men did.

09:52.500 --> 09:53.956
[Marty] Did they take offense to that?

09:54.550 --> 09:56.290
Trust is a two-way street, Jacob.

09:56.380 --> 09:59.133
This goes forward,
you guys stand to make millions.

09:59.220 --> 10:02.348
But everything you do
is making it harder. Everything.

10:04.180 --> 10:05.590
You want the casino or not?

10:07.020 --> 10:11.013
[pastor] And welcome to our
55th Annual Governor's Prayer Luncheon.

10:11.110 --> 10:14.932
It's so good to see
so many familiar faces this afternoon.

10:15.030 --> 10:18.488
We are here to honor some
of our dIstIngUIshed leaders,

10:18.570 --> 10:21.482
but we are also here _
to remember our redemption.

10:21.570 --> 10:25.654
And we are redeemed,
but not through corruptible things

10:25.750 --> 10:27.820
such as silver and gold,

10:27.910 --> 10:31.038
but through the precious blood of Jesus.

10:31.130 --> 10:32.449
Do I hear an amen?

10:32.540 --> 10:34.792
-[a|l] Amen.
-[pastor] Please have a seat.

10:47.140 --> 10:49.301
We are betraying who we are.

10:59.650 --> 11:00.560
We're good.

11:16.840 --> 11:20.719
-The business with Ash... You understand.
-[cell phone chimes]

11:21.510 --> 11:22.386
Yeah.

11:24.180 --> 11:26.808
Shit. I gotta go, okay? Damn it!

11:32.190 --> 11:36.638
-Another casino? Really?
-Look at this as a jobs bill, Senator.

11:36.730 --> 11:39.437
Our research shows that we will create
hundreds of jobs

11:39.530 --> 11:42.146
-in the hospitality sector.
-Minimum-wage shit jobs.

11:42.240 --> 11:44.902
Gambling's just a regressive tax
on the poor.

11:44.990 --> 11:48.903
Senator Blake, I'm sure you recognize
that casinos provide millions of dollars

11:48.990 --> 11:52.824
-in tax revenue for education--
-Is this the Charles Wilkes-backed bill?

11:52.920 --> 11:57.038
Uh. Well, yes, he recognizes the benefits
that could come--

11:57.130 --> 12:02.250
He recognizes only money, his money,
and it's destroyed Missouri politics.

12:04.640 --> 12:07.427
[Wendy] Our studies show this casino
will create hundreds of jobs--

12:07.510 --> 12:09.887
Frankly, I couldn't give two shits
for your bill.

12:10.430 --> 12:14.093
-But it will create tax revenues that--
-How much we talking about?

12:14.190 --> 12:17.102
It could be hundreds of thousands
of dollars for education.

12:17.190 --> 12:18.726
Okay, don't be naive.

12:20.110 --> 12:22.146
Twenty-five to your re-election campaign.

12:22.860 --> 12:25.602
-Untraceable.
-No need. Just cut me a check.

12:32.870 --> 12:35.111
[Ma/1y] ,
Senator Mercer. Hi.

12:35.620 --> 12:37.497
I got here as quick as I could.

12:38.090 --> 12:41.127
-You're wasting your time.
-Just tell me what happened.

12:41.210 --> 12:44.213
One of my drivers was run off the road.
They blew his hand off.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.130
Um...

12:49.510 --> 12:53.298
Who's "they"? And why do you think
this has to do with the casino bill?

12:53.390 --> 12:55.187
They made it crystal clear
what they wanted.

12:55.900 --> 12:58.300
-Again, who's "they"?
-Kansas City mob.

12:58.400 --> 13:02.279
They're heavy in the casino business.
You do the math. I'm pulling the bill.

13:04.530 --> 13:08.443
Wait. Hang on. Let me pay
for your man's medical bills

13:08.530 --> 13:11.442
and give me some time
to work this thing out,like a day or two.

13:11.700 --> 13:14.282
I can't take the risk. I got a family.

13:15.080 --> 13:16.741
You'd do the same for yours.

13:36.270 --> 13:37.430
[laughs]

13:48.610 --> 13:50.237
[boy laughs]

13:51.990 --> 13:54.242
-Don't be rude, Kaiden.
-[woman] Darlene Snell.

13:55.040 --> 13:56.246
Right back this way.

14:00.710 --> 14:01.836
Mom!

14:10.930 --> 14:16.015
My husband and me,
we know it's late to be startin' a family.

14:16.930 --> 14:18.841
But we just lost someone close to us,

14:18.940 --> 14:22.353
and I just can't rid myself
of this feeling that something's missing.

14:22.940 --> 14:24.726
And you think that's a child?

14:24.820 --> 14:26.139
We already have a dog.

14:28.610 --> 14:32.114
You missed this question,
how old you and your husband are.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.196
Oh. Does that matter?

14:37.160 --> 14:40.493
Children need love,
and we got some to spare.

14:41.630 --> 14:44.872
In general, the agency doesn't like
to place children with parents

14:44.960 --> 14:46.587
who are more than
40 years older than them.

14:46.670 --> 14:48.376
Well, that is a stupid rule.

14:49.010 --> 14:51.501
-You may not agree with it--
-I don't.

14:55.060 --> 14:57.631
Do you know what it takes to run a farm?

14:58.770 --> 15:01.978
We're both strong.
We are respected community members.

15:02.060 --> 15:03.357
I'm sure.

15:03.440 --> 15:07.524
A child needs space to run.
And we've got hundreds of acres.

15:08.030 --> 15:10.646
Mrs. Snell, it's not impossible.

15:11.700 --> 15:13.065
But it is unlikely.

15:13.700 --> 15:16.237
Now, you can start off
by taking in a foster child.

15:16.330 --> 15:19.572
Then the state can come in
and evaluate your fitness.

15:21.170 --> 15:23.240
[typing]

15:25.290 --> 15:26.791
[scoffs]

15:27.670 --> 15:28.659
Fitness.

15:48.650 --> 15:50.390
[Mason]
Where does evilcome from?

15:51.070 --> 15:53.402
We know it's there,
but we can't see it, right?

15:53.490 --> 15:55.697
Then where does it come from?
No one knows.

15:55.780 --> 15:57.020
It's unanswered.

15:58.330 --> 15:59.194
Thank you.

15:59.290 --> 16:02.362
The serpent was in the garden
before Adam and Eve showed up.

16:03.790 --> 16:06.953
The bite of the apple
was not the original sin.

16:07.040 --> 16:08.541
Lucifer's fall was.

16:10.090 --> 16:15.039
In Job 41, God said,
"Everything under Heaven belongs to me."

16:15.140 --> 16:17.756
He takes responsibility here.
He's omnipotent.

16:20.470 --> 16:23.553
And then He gives us free will
to choose, right, sir?

16:25.770 --> 16:27.761
[continues indistinctly] [Marty] Jonah, I just heard Mom pull up.

16:40.160 --> 16:42.492
Better get to bed
or bad things are gonna happen.

16:43.000 --> 16:44.285
[Jonah] I'm almost done.

16:44.370 --> 16:47.248
You've been at it since dinner.
Too late. There she is.

16:47.880 --> 16:49.120
You said this school was easy.

16:50.170 --> 16:51.296
[door closes]

16:51.380 --> 16:54.258
-It's extra credit. _
-[Wendy] Why am I hearing Jonah's v0|ce?

16:54.340 --> 16:55.329
[Marty] I told him.

16:55.430 --> 16:58.388
-[groans] You let him stay up?
'[Marty] Come on. Get to bed.

16:58.470 --> 16:59.926
You're an easy touch.

17:00.430 --> 17:02.216
[Marty] He's a good student, I guess.

17:02.310 --> 17:03.550
Um...

17:06.060 --> 17:08.517
What did Wilkes say
about the truck driver?

17:09.610 --> 17:12.682
Well, he'll push Mercer,
but it's a problem.

17:14.860 --> 17:16.157
If the mob's pressuring him,

17:16.240 --> 17:18.447
who knows how many other senators
they're working on.

17:19.280 --> 17:22.158
-And how many votes do we need now?
-Two.

17:22.240 --> 17:24.492
But a lot can happen in 24 hours.

17:24.580 --> 17:26.457
I told you there was dinner in the fridge.

17:27.210 --> 17:29.121
I had other things on my mind.

17:30.750 --> 17:31.796
[Wendy sighs]

17:32.460 --> 17:34.371
I saw Mason Young today.

17:35.630 --> 17:39.293
He was preaching on a street corner.
His baby was with him.

17:39.390 --> 17:40.209
[Marty] Mm-hmm.

17:41.560 --> 17:42.925
Isn't there something we can do?

17:43.560 --> 17:46.768
-I don't think that's a good idea.
-What happened wouldn't have happened

17:46.850 --> 17:48.511
-if we didn't gotten involved--
-We talked about this, Wendy.

17:48.600 --> 17:50.010
-People make choices...
-He's on the street...

17:50.110 --> 17:51.259
-...with a baby.
-...and people have to live by them.

17:51.360 --> 17:53.180
Listen, there's nothing that we can do,
okay?

17:53.280 --> 17:56.943
What about our kids? Let's keep our eye
on the ball, all right?

17:57.030 --> 17:58.315
-[door opens]
-Charlotte?

17:58.410 --> 17:59.445
[Charlotte] Hi.

17:59.530 --> 18:02.237
I had a bad day, okay? Sorry.

18:02.330 --> 18:03.820
-Hey.
-[Marty] Hi.

18:03.910 --> 18:05.070
I'm really tired.

18:05.580 --> 18:07.536
-[Wendy] Finish your homework?
-Yeah.

18:09.960 --> 18:11.166
I'm gonna go to bed.

18:14.760 --> 18:15.579
Night.

18:17.930 --> 18:18.828
Was she high?

18:19.720 --> 18:20.835
Hmm.

18:21.800 --> 18:23.006
Not much else to do here.

18:23.600 --> 18:25.056
I don't mind a little weed.

18:25.140 --> 18:27.222
I just worry about what she's gonna say
when she smokes it.

18:27.730 --> 18:29.129
-I'll do that. You go to bed.
-You sure?

18:29.230 --> 18:30.049
Yeah.

18:30.770 --> 18:32.260
[Wendy sighs] Thank you.

18:47.000 --> 18:48.240
[Ma/1y]
Sure is a nice boat.

18:49.370 --> 18:51.031
[W/lkes]
Yeah, I hire to go fast.

18:53.040 --> 18:55.918
I talked to Senator Mercer
late last night.

18:56.420 --> 18:57.546
Oh, yeah?

18:57.630 --> 19:00.793
Yeah, he'll give us a day,
but he's pretty spooked.

19:01.220 --> 19:02.585
[Marty] Huh.

19:03.600 --> 19:05.556
You pretty sure that the mob
is behind the trucker?

19:06.270 --> 19:07.714
Yeah, it makes sense.

19:08.310 --> 19:09.880
Frank Cosgrove plays rough.

19:11.350 --> 19:13.261
Tell me what you know about that guy.

19:13.360 --> 19:16.318
His mob outfit controlled
the Detroit Teamsters for years.

19:16.900 --> 19:20.063
He moved down here when they invested
in a couple casinos.

19:20.570 --> 19:22.151
They probably don't want the competition.

19:22.870 --> 19:24.314
Can we get him to back off?

19:24.990 --> 19:26.981
We? Come on. There's no we.

19:27.080 --> 19:29.116
I've done what I can.
This is in your court.

19:29.620 --> 19:32.202
If you can't get it done by tonight,
Mercer pulls the bill.

19:35.250 --> 19:37.047
-Hey.
-[Wendy] Hi.

19:38.340 --> 19:40.001
Your wife's a major talent.

19:41.090 --> 19:43.172
She could have a big political career here
if she wants.

19:43.760 --> 19:45.546
She's got a job. Thank you, though.

19:45.640 --> 19:48.552
[chuckles] When you said you'd pick me up,
I assumed it'd be a car.

19:48.640 --> 19:50.301
Well, this way's faster.

19:50.390 --> 19:52.096
We can work out of my house. Come on.

19:52.190 --> 19:54.146
-[cell phone chimes]
-[Marty] Hold on. I gotta take this.

19:54.230 --> 19:56.050
-See you later. Have fun.
-[Wendy] Okay.

19:56.150 --> 19:57.060
[Marty] Bye.

19:57.520 --> 20:00.739
Hey. I thought I was gonna hear
from you last night.What's going on?

20:00.820 --> 20:03.402
Yeah, well, we hit a little bit of a snag.

20:03.490 --> 20:05.697
Your boat doesn't have a fucking engine.

20:05.780 --> 20:06.610
What?

20:07.330 --> 20:08.945
What's Devereaux say?

20:10.000 --> 20:12.150
Devereaux says what a piece of shit says.

20:12.710 --> 20:14.325
Well, just get it upriver.

20:14.420 --> 20:16.581
Tow it if you have to.
I 7/ co yer the cost.

20:16.670 --> 20:18.626
Okay. Bye.

20:19.380 --> 20:22.508
[Devereaux] Well, sugar lips,
we got a deal or what?

20:22.590 --> 20:24.546
[Ruth] Not for a boat without an engine.

20:25.050 --> 20:28.213
[Devereaux] There wasn't no contingencies
on the deal I made.

20:29.010 --> 20:31.137
How am I supposed
to get this boat to Bagnell?

20:31.640 --> 20:34.052
That's really doesn't concern me.

20:34.140 --> 20:38.930
As I told your boss,
there's another offer waiting on deck.

20:39.520 --> 20:42.182
Then take it.
No one's gonna pay a red nickel for a paddle wheeler
that doesn't even paddle.

20:45.660 --> 20:46.775
[Devereaux] Hold up now.

20:47.910 --> 20:50.868
I might drop the price a few hundred...

20:51.830 --> 20:56.620
if you'd care to sit on my lap
for an hour or two. [chuckles]

21:04.130 --> 21:05.119
[chuckles]

21:06.010 --> 21:06.920
Ah.

21:07.510 --> 21:09.546
So, we're negotiating now?

21:09.640 --> 21:11.961
[Devereaux] Yes, we are.
You got a counter?

21:12.060 --> 21:13.766
[both chuckle]

21:15.230 --> 21:16.720
[Ruth] Let's just make something clear.

21:18.270 --> 21:21.478
I wouldn't fuck you
if your dick were made out of gold.

21:21.570 --> 21:23.231
[exclaims and laughs]

21:29.530 --> 21:30.690
[yells]

21:31.290 --> 21:33.110
-This cunt likes to kick!
-Yo.

21:33.200 --> 21:36.249
-What the fuck is wrong with--
-Get some, skinny bitch!

21:36.330 --> 21:38.207
[Devereaux groans] Cody,
get your ass over here!

21:38.290 --> 21:41.339
Holy goddamn concrete! What the fuck?

21:41.420 --> 21:45.459
Get this fucking chair up, Cody.
What's the matter with you? Ugh! Shit!

21:45.550 --> 21:46.960
[groans] Oh, God!

21:47.050 --> 21:50.292
[coughs, gasps]

21:50.800 --> 21:55.260
If you was my daughter,
I'd tar the living shit outta you.

21:55.350 --> 21:58.433
And if I was your daughter,
I'd slit my throat first.

22:00.310 --> 22:04.019
We both know that
there is no fucking backup offer.

22:04.110 --> 22:07.102
Drop 50K and let me
get the fuck out of here.

22:08.660 --> 22:09.729
We got a deal?

22:10.820 --> 22:12.276
[Cody panting]

22:17.710 --> 22:18.825
Get the fuck outta here.

22:25.420 --> 22:28.833
[announcer on TV]
Welcome, America,
to another edition 0/5..

22:28.930 --> 22:30.921
-Fact or Fiction!
-[door opens]

22:31.970 --> 22:34.131
[Marty] Hey, Buddy,
can I talk to you for a second?

22:35.430 --> 22:36.306
[TV switches off]

22:36.390 --> 22:41.089
These shows... greatest ads ever
for capitalism.

22:41.190 --> 22:44.432
Any problem would be solved
with a new toaster oven.

22:48.200 --> 22:49.519
Why do you watch them?

22:50.490 --> 22:52.902
-So I feel superior.
-Hmm.

22:52.990 --> 22:57.029
Like I'm not sitting in a basement,
watching daytime TV.

22:58.790 --> 23:02.908
So, what's your problem?
You need a new toaster oven?

23:03.420 --> 23:06.412
You know Frank Cosgrove
from your days in Detroit?

23:06.510 --> 23:07.875
He used to be involved with the Teamsters.

23:09.130 --> 23:10.540
He's a mobster.

23:12.050 --> 23:13.426
Yeah, I knew him.

23:14.760 --> 23:16.091
We did some business.

23:17.020 --> 23:20.808
He's in Kansas City, and I need to get
to him. I could use your help.

23:26.230 --> 23:28.733
Well, one thing you better know
walkin' in.

23:30.280 --> 23:31.850
Cosgrove's a psycho.

23:33.320 --> 23:36.949
You look at him wrong, he'll gut you.

23:39.910 --> 23:40.740
Hmm.

23:42.580 --> 23:44.286
[applause on TV]

23:49.010 --> 23:50.625
I was thinking about today.

23:53.840 --> 23:55.592
[Wilkes] You wanna take the helm?

23:55.680 --> 23:57.307
-[Wendy] Sure.
-[Wilkes] Come on.

23:58.640 --> 24:02.553
Just keep the wheel steady.
Pull this back if you want to slow down

24:02.640 --> 24:04.551
-and forward for faster.
-[Wendy] Okay.

24:06.900 --> 24:07.889
[Wilkes] There you go.

24:10.780 --> 24:13.908
So, tell me. Why does this casino
mean so much to you?

24:14.910 --> 24:19.529
[Wendy] Marty's an entrepreneur,
kinda like yourself. He saw a need.

24:20.200 --> 24:22.111
[Wilkes] No one needs another casino.

24:22.830 --> 24:24.741
[Wendy] Our investors would disagree.

24:24.830 --> 24:27.207
[Wilkes] Yeah? And who are they?

24:28.340 --> 24:30.831
[Wendy] They wanna remain
silent investors.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.753
[Wilkes] Oh, that's a non-answer answer.

24:34.260 --> 24:36.171
[Wendy] You have oppo research.

24:36.850 --> 24:38.590
Pretty sure you know who they are.

24:39.350 --> 24:41.887
The gambling commission's
gonna investigate.

24:42.430 --> 24:44.637
We're prepared. It's all legal.

24:45.400 --> 24:47.550
What we don't have are the votes.

24:49.320 --> 24:50.605
Do you have any ideas?

24:51.440 --> 24:53.067
Did you take a look at Foreman's file?

24:54.490 --> 24:56.310
I'm not comfortable with that.

24:57.070 --> 24:58.480
It's a dirty business.

24:59.450 --> 25:01.077
But if you really believe
in what you're doing,

25:01.160 --> 25:03.537
sometimes the ends justify the means.

25:04.210 --> 25:06.417
Just depends how important it is to you.

25:07.420 --> 25:09.911
But I have some ideas.
We'll talk 'em through.

25:10.420 --> 25:12.376
We're getting close. Let me take over.

25:36.820 --> 25:37.696
[Marty] Hi, there.

25:40.450 --> 25:41.269
[man] Help you?

25:41.870 --> 25:43.861
We're here to see Frank Cosgrove.

25:43.950 --> 25:45.247
[man] Got an appointment?

25:45.330 --> 25:46.991
No, but this is important.

25:48.420 --> 25:50.661
Mr. Cosgrove don't see people
without appointments.

25:51.170 --> 25:51.989
[Buddy] Hey.

25:52.960 --> 25:54.837
Tell him Jimmy Small is here.

25:57.130 --> 25:58.085
Go on.

26:03.100 --> 26:04.465
You don't need to know.

26:07.640 --> 26:09.301
One thing you should know,

26:10.270 --> 26:12.977
Cosgrove always thought I fucked his wife.

26:14.610 --> 26:16.066
Great. Good.

26:17.360 --> 26:18.770
-[exhales]
-[chuckles]

26:18.860 --> 26:19.736
Dynamite.

26:22.280 --> 26:25.249
[Ruth] Thanks, Daddy.
I didn't know who else to call.

26:26.250 --> 26:27.865
[Cade] It's what we do for blood.

26:28.750 --> 26:30.741
So, tell me, firecracker.

26:31.500 --> 26:35.618
How much your boss pay
for this heap of shit? [laughs]

26:37.090 --> 26:38.751
[Ruth] A million or so.

26:38.840 --> 26:41.331
[Cade] A million? A mill--

26:41.430 --> 26:44.092
You gotta be shittin' me.
A million in cash?

26:44.180 --> 26:45.590
[Ruth] Something like that.

26:46.180 --> 26:48.808
You carried all that cash down here?

26:48.890 --> 26:50.938
You skim a little for yourself?

26:51.020 --> 26:52.260
[chuckles]

26:55.980 --> 26:57.732
I got something else working.

27:04.200 --> 27:05.690
I saw a house yesterday.

27:07.370 --> 27:08.359
A house?

27:09.290 --> 27:10.826
-[Ruth] For sale.
-Wow.

27:11.330 --> 27:14.993
Yeah. It was really nice, you know?

27:15.500 --> 27:21.507
There's enough rooms for everybody
and a baclqard with flowers.

27:21.590 --> 27:23.467
It was real nice.

27:24.050 --> 27:24.960
Nice.

27:25.060 --> 27:27.551
You know, once the casino gets rollin',

27:27.640 --> 27:30.939
there's gonna be a lot more money
comin' in. Marty's promised.

27:31.020 --> 27:33.853
You know, I can help Wyatt out
with college

27:33.940 --> 27:35.760
and maybe get you a new pickup.

27:36.780 --> 27:39.271
And I bet Marty'd get me
a mortgage, if I asked.

27:39.780 --> 27:41.099
So, you...

27:41.700 --> 27:43.986
You in good with him, huh?

28:02.300 --> 28:04.291
[rock music playing]

28:11.020 --> 28:11.839
[Wendy] Hi.

28:12.520 --> 28:16.012
-Is Ruth Langmore around?
-[woman] Is she in some kind of trouble?

28:16.400 --> 28:17.719
No, no.

28:19.650 --> 28:21.641
-Can I get you a drink?
-No. [chuckles]

28:22.360 --> 28:24.100
No, it's a little too early for that.

28:28.120 --> 28:29.735
She's very talented. What's her name?

28:30.870 --> 28:31.746
[woman] Lulu.

28:37.420 --> 28:39.797
You know what? Get me a shot of tequila.

28:53.640 --> 28:54.846
Hi, Lulu.

28:55.900 --> 28:56.719
Hi.

29:00.780 --> 29:01.769
I'm Wendy.

29:13.330 --> 29:15.707
There's a lot more where that came from.

29:29.720 --> 29:30.675
Jimmy Small.

29:35.390 --> 29:37.517
[chuckles]

29:41.190 --> 29:45.194
-I thought you were fucking dead.
-You don't have long to wait.

29:45.280 --> 29:46.315
[Cosgrove] You sick?

29:46.950 --> 29:48.156
Bum ticker.

29:48.240 --> 29:49.309
[Cosgrove] That's tough, man.

29:49.410 --> 29:52.618
[chuckles] But we had some times.

29:53.240 --> 29:54.616
[Buddy laughs]

29:54.870 --> 29:57.168
That scuffle down in Flint...

29:57.250 --> 29:58.319
[laughs]

29:58.420 --> 29:59.990
That was more like a riot.

30:01.340 --> 30:03.752
-We got the contract we wanted, didn't we?
-Yeah.

30:06.510 --> 30:07.875
[chuckles]

30:07.970 --> 30:10.962
-What brings you my way?
-He does.

30:13.140 --> 30:14.846
Hi, Marty Byrde.

30:15.730 --> 30:21.009
My firm is backing the casino bill
that I know you're familiar with.

30:21.520 --> 30:23.932
That bill is dead. [sighs]

30:24.030 --> 30:26.681
Well, not... not quite yet, um...

30:27.860 --> 30:32.229
Sir, I have a special expertise
in finding...

30:33.370 --> 30:35.440
creative approaches to moving money.

30:35.830 --> 30:37.149
And this avoids taxes.

30:37.870 --> 30:41.749
This avoids interest from, you know,
shall we say, other parties.

30:43.250 --> 30:46.708
And I think that you might be willing to--

30:46.800 --> 30:48.461
WE have DUI“ DWI"! accountants.

30:50.930 --> 30:53.751
-I'm sure you do, but none--
-We're done here.

30:54.720 --> 30:55.846
The bill's dead.

30:56.220 --> 30:58.302
[Buddy] Oh, cut the shit, Frank.

30:58.390 --> 31:00.130
You got problems.

31:00.230 --> 31:01.299
You know it.

31:02.980 --> 31:04.936
You're on thin ice with the brethren.

31:05.320 --> 31:08.278
And this right-to-work shit
is gonna get worse.

31:08.360 --> 31:09.440
We're doing just fine.

31:09.530 --> 31:12.158
Your Teamsters' pension is suffering.

31:12.240 --> 31:14.868
That means your skim is going down.

31:17.000 --> 31:19.036
Your management can't be happy.

31:19.120 --> 31:21.873
[chuckles] Am I getting warm?

31:22.790 --> 31:25.418
[Marty] Sir, what if we made
the casino a union shop,

31:25.500 --> 31:29.618
where every construction truck,
every food delivery, every limo,

31:29.720 --> 31:30.584
all Teamsters.

31:30.680 --> 31:33.217
You deliver for the union,
you get your cut.

31:33.300 --> 31:34.255
It's a win-win.

31:35.180 --> 31:36.499
Do you want me to trust you? -Yeah.
-[Cosgrove] Why?

31:39.270 --> 31:42.342
Why? Well-- [coughs]

31:42.440 --> 31:45.147
Because I'm here, on oxygen,

31:46.570 --> 31:47.810
vouching for him.

31:48.860 --> 31:49.986
That's fucking why.

31:51.740 --> 31:53.446
Fucking mick bastard.

31:53.990 --> 31:55.776
[coughs]

31:56.780 --> 31:58.532
-[Buddy exhales]
-Careful.

31:59.040 --> 32:01.247
I could end your suffering right now.

32:01.330 --> 32:05.209
[laughs] You'd be doing me a favor.

32:08.420 --> 32:09.500
Hey, Frank. How's your wife?

32:15.970 --> 32:18.768
[sighs]

32:21.060 --> 32:22.049
[chuckles]

32:25.150 --> 32:28.688
[both laugh]

32:35.910 --> 32:39.619
You always were a tough motherfucker.

32:39.700 --> 32:41.440
[both laugh]

32:46.170 --> 32:47.125
Hmm.

32:49.630 --> 32:51.086
Let's talk, Marty Byrde.

32:51.590 --> 32:54.081
[chattering]

33:17.070 --> 33:18.776
Can I have a Jack and Coke?

33:45.390 --> 33:46.345
Hi.

33:47.770 --> 33:49.476
I was wondering ifI could join you,

33:49.560 --> 33:53.929
and since I saw you come in alone,
I hope that's a yes.

33:55.110 --> 33:55.986
Sure.

33:57.950 --> 33:59.440
Okay if I buy you that drink?

34:00.910 --> 34:01.774
Sure.

34:03.490 --> 34:04.320
I'm Terry.

34:05.080 --> 34:05.990
Lulu.

34:06.910 --> 34:08.070
Of course you are.

34:08.580 --> 34:10.070
You look like a Lulu.

34:15.510 --> 34:16.625
[whispers]

34:23.260 --> 34:24.466
[chuckles]

34:25.180 --> 34:26.420
Iam.

34:26.520 --> 34:27.885
Let's go upstairs.

34:44.290 --> 34:45.780
[Marty] Can I ask a question?

34:46.870 --> 34:49.031
[Buddy] You wanna know
ifI fucked his wife?

34:51.420 --> 34:52.409
I'm a gentleman.

34:53.750 --> 34:55.456
So all's I'm gonna say is

34:55.960 --> 34:59.123
she had a tattoo
on the inside of her thigh.

35:00.380 --> 35:01.586
What did it say?

35:05.010 --> 35:06.090
[Marty] "Keep on truckin'"?

35:35.210 --> 35:37.041
-Who the fuck are you?
-[camera shutter clicking]

35:37.170 --> 35:38.580
Untie me, you fuckin' bitch.

35:41.180 --> 35:42.886
[Wendy] Hello, Mr. Foreman.

35:47.560 --> 35:49.721
You can get dressed and go now, Lulu.

35:49.810 --> 35:51.937
I'm gonna leave this for you in your bag.

35:54.150 --> 35:55.856
[Wendy] I'm so sorry, Mr. Foreman.

35:57.280 --> 36:00.272
This is as uncomfortable for me
as It IS for you.

36:02.530 --> 36:03.656
Well, maybe not.

36:06.240 --> 36:08.071
Now, who can we get to untie you?

36:13.250 --> 36:16.993
[Ruth] Two, three, four, five.

36:18.960 --> 36:20.871
This is for the first two months.

36:21.840 --> 36:23.296
Good night. Thank you.

36:38.860 --> 36:40.270
Thousand sounds about right?

36:41.240 --> 36:42.889
It'll do. [chuckles]

36:43.740 --> 36:45.355
This is just the beginning, Daddy.

36:46.160 --> 36:50.654
Ijust hung up with Marty,
and he's agreed to give you a job.

36:52.080 --> 36:53.866
I'll be working for you now.

36:53.960 --> 36:54.995
[chuckles]

36:56.750 --> 36:57.705
It's not like that.

36:59.420 --> 37:01.547
Come on. Get in the truck.

37:01.630 --> 37:02.961
Let's get out of here.

37:05.840 --> 37:07.467
[car engine starts]

37:23.780 --> 37:25.850
[Wendy] Thank you for seeing me
so late, Senator Foreman.

37:25.950 --> 37:27.235
Just show me the video.

37:27.320 --> 37:29.368
-You don't have to look at it.
-Give it to me.

37:36.580 --> 37:38.036
[Terry]
Who the fuck are you?

37:39.710 --> 37:41.371
Untie me, you fuck/n ’ hitch.

37:46.130 --> 37:47.256
That bastard.

37:51.260 --> 37:52.261
I'm sorry.

37:54.140 --> 37:56.517
I should call the state police.
This is extortion.

37:58.480 --> 37:59.799
Yes, it is. [chuckles]

37:59.900 --> 38:02.607
But if you call the authorities,
it just goes public.

38:03.530 --> 38:06.397
This way, no one's the wiser.
No one gets hurt.

38:08.700 --> 38:11.988
If I vote for this bill, how do I know
this won't surface later?

38:12.080 --> 38:13.229
I give you my word.

38:17.120 --> 38:19.827
Your word? You're disgusting.

38:24.090 --> 38:25.296
Good night, Senator.

38:35.470 --> 38:36.471
[Marty] Charlotte?

38:37.100 --> 38:37.930
[Charlotte] Hi.

38:38.020 --> 38:40.511
Hi. I haven't seen you all day.
Get in here.

38:43.190 --> 38:48.059
Um... I would like to talk to you
about yesterday.

38:48.740 --> 38:49.729
Okay.

38:53.280 --> 38:54.827
Anything you want to tell me?

38:59.250 --> 39:01.286
I know we talked about being honest.

39:01.790 --> 39:03.166
And I haven't been.

39:03.840 --> 39:05.046
I'm sorry.

39:05.130 --> 39:06.199
You lied to us?

39:07.880 --> 39:10.371
I told Mom I was studying
for a test yesterday.

39:10.800 --> 39:11.710
Ah.

39:11.800 --> 39:13.176
And I wasn't.

39:13.260 --> 39:15.637
You weren't shopping for Visine, either.

39:16.850 --> 39:18.090
What do you mean?

39:19.600 --> 39:21.556
The first rule of smoking weed?

39:22.060 --> 39:22.890
You knew?

39:23.690 --> 39:25.476
Why didn't you say anything?

39:27.280 --> 39:28.736
Who were you with?

39:29.530 --> 39:33.193
I was with Wyatt.
He's been really sad since his dad died.

39:33.280 --> 39:34.326
Mm-hmm.

39:35.870 --> 39:36.780
Are you guys...

39:36.870 --> 39:38.531
[chuckles] No, we're just friends.

39:38.620 --> 39:40.497
He's not like the rest of them.

39:40.580 --> 39:42.662
He's not what you think he is.

39:43.960 --> 39:48.249
Listen, you understand that you might
say the wrong thing when you're high.

39:48.340 --> 39:49.216
I know.

39:50.420 --> 39:53.924
I'm sorry. I'll be careful. I promise.
[kisses]

39:57.680 --> 40:00.057
I can't believe I used to
carry you like a football.

40:01.310 --> 40:02.265
Charlotte...

40:04.310 --> 40:06.562
I never wanted this to land
on you and your brother.

40:08.030 --> 40:11.568
-I know. It's okay.
-[cell phone chiming]

40:12.450 --> 40:13.519
I gotta study now.

40:13.610 --> 40:15.362
-Okay, good night.
-For real.

40:15.450 --> 40:16.326
Hi.

40:16.410 --> 40:18.401
[Wendy]
Hi How’d it go in Kansas City?

40:18.490 --> 40:21.402
Well, we worked it out. Or Buddy did.

40:21.500 --> 40:24.958
-But we had to cut a deal with the mob.
-Of course we did

40:25.040 --> 40:25.870
Mm-hmm.

40:27.000 --> 40:29.082
God, I feel like I need
to takea shower after tonight.

40:29.590 --> 40:33.082
-Well, we're doing what we need to do.
-I know.

40:33.180 --> 40:34.420
Did we get the votes?

40:37.300 --> 40:39.097
We are still one vote short.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.143
I'm gonna go see Wilkes,
see what he can do.

40:45.650 --> 40:47.186
I won't be home till late.

40:47.820 --> 40:50.106
Okay. All r/ght; bye.

40:50.190 --> 40:51.566
Okay. Bye.

41:25.140 --> 41:27.142
[pop music playing] [chattering]

41:54.090 --> 41:56.718
Hey, what are you doing in there?
You're missing the party.

41:57.590 --> 41:59.217
[Rachel] You can start without me.

41:59.850 --> 42:02.808
-You sure? 'Cause this is rocket fuel.
-[Rachel] I'm sure.

42:08.100 --> 42:09.931
[sniffing]

42:12.820 --> 42:14.356
[man] So, where are you from anyway?

42:16.530 --> 42:17.770
Rachel, you all right in there?

42:23.330 --> 42:24.536
[Wilkes laughing]

42:24.620 --> 42:28.283
Man, I'd loved to have seen the look on
that holy roller's face when she saw this.

42:28.370 --> 42:30.326
-[Wendy] Hmm.
-[Wilkes] Good work!

42:31.250 --> 42:33.411
-You said you wanted ice?
-Mm-hmm.

42:34.880 --> 42:37.121
-We're still one vote short.
-[WI|kes] Well...

42:37.220 --> 42:39.120
it's impressive that you got this far.

42:39.220 --> 42:40.960
Frankly, I expected to lose.

42:41.680 --> 42:43.500
Then why did you stay involved?

42:44.810 --> 42:46.801
I wanted to see what you could do.

42:47.350 --> 42:50.148
There are gonna be other votes,
other campaigns,

42:50.650 --> 42:52.606
and I'd like you to consider
working on them.

42:52.690 --> 42:54.772
Oh. Oh, Charlie.

42:55.530 --> 42:57.486
[chuckling] I'm really flattered.

42:57.570 --> 42:59.401
No, I am, but right now, I...

43:00.030 --> 43:01.986
I need to make this happen.

43:02.070 --> 43:03.230
So...

43:03.620 --> 43:05.156
how do we get that one last vote?

43:05.450 --> 43:07.702
Yeah, Blake's gonna be a tough vote.

43:10.540 --> 43:11.916
But there may be a play.

43:12.000 --> 43:14.491
I've read his file.
He's a crusader. He's clean.

43:14.590 --> 43:17.377
[sighs] You look close enough,
there's always dirt.

43:17.880 --> 43:21.338
-He won't vote for anything you back.
-He doesn't have to.

43:21.930 --> 43:23.215
He just has to not show up.

43:23.720 --> 43:25.096
And they'll be a vote short.

43:26.850 --> 43:30.559
If you already had something on him,
why didn't you tell me?

43:31.060 --> 43:33.551
Because I didn't want to waste it
on a lost cause.

43:34.440 --> 43:37.273
-Oh. Huh.
-[chuckles]

43:38.820 --> 43:41.527
I'm sure this all feels like
some kind of game to you.

43:42.240 --> 43:43.980
-It's not to me.
-Oh.

43:49.540 --> 43:52.202
[clicks tongue] You told me that was
your mother's.

43:54.290 --> 43:56.588
[both chuckle]

43:57.500 --> 43:59.411
But it wasn't, was it?

44:01.050 --> 44:02.039
Hmm?

44:08.100 --> 44:09.761
All right, let me see this thing.

44:10.770 --> 44:12.726
[sighs deeply]

44:13.850 --> 44:14.930
There it is.

44:16.270 --> 44:17.180
Yeah.

44:18.570 --> 44:20.640
You just used this to get to me.

44:22.280 --> 44:25.943
_Sister Alice called me
the minute you left the orphanage.

44:26.990 --> 44:29.868
She told me you were there,
asking about my past.

44:33.210 --> 44:34.450
I didn't mind.

44:35.170 --> 44:37.661
I appreciated your ingenuity.

44:42.800 --> 44:44.290
It is a game, Wendy.

44:45.720 --> 44:47.961
-We both play it.
-Yeah.

44:50.350 --> 44:52.762
Is that what this is?

44:53.980 --> 44:58.144
A little quid pro quo?

44:58.940 --> 45:00.680
I don't know what you're talking about.

45:02.860 --> 45:05.237
I sleep with you, you deliver Blake.

45:07.320 --> 45:09.652
No, one thing has nothing
to do with the other.

45:09.740 --> 45:12.573
-[laughs]
-Oh, Charlie.

45:13.540 --> 45:15.201
Oh, come on. Be direct.

45:16.460 --> 45:18.997
I just want to know what the terms
of the deal are.

45:19.250 --> 45:22.549
-Now you're insulting me.
-It's just a game, right?

45:23.760 --> 45:26.752
-The ends always justify the means.
-Yeah.

45:28.050 --> 45:29.847
They did with Senator Foreman.

45:29.930 --> 45:32.558
-Right. Right?
-Yeah. Yeah.

45:32.640 --> 45:34.972
[chuckles]

45:38.110 --> 45:39.475
Good night, Charlie.

45:53.540 --> 45:55.531
[rock music playing on stereo]

46:03.050 --> 46:04.870
[Cade] I need some smokes.
You want anything?

46:07.130 --> 46:08.176
[Ruth] Just a Coke.

46:19.650 --> 46:20.799
[music stops]

46:26.110 --> 46:27.099
[woman shrieks]

46:45.670 --> 46:48.924
[Cade] Daddy forgot your Coke,
but he got this.

47:11.870 --> 47:14.077
Why the fuck did you do that, Daddy?

47:16.950 --> 47:18.406
You're on parole.

47:19.830 --> 47:21.661
You got a grand in your pocket.

47:23.540 --> 47:24.666
You got a job.

47:24.750 --> 47:26.160
Because I felt like it.

47:28.380 --> 47:29.369
[chuckles]

47:30.010 --> 47:31.466
I don't understand you.

47:32.590 --> 47:34.000
You don't understand me?

47:34.600 --> 47:36.591
[laughing] Yeah?

47:37.470 --> 47:40.382
Well, let me explain some shit for you,
little girl.

47:41.480 --> 47:43.971
You ain't buying no picket fuckin' house.

47:45.150 --> 47:49.109
And you ain't spending your life working
for no Marty fucking Byrde.

47:50.400 --> 47:51.731
You're a Langmore.

47:52.950 --> 47:55.441
This is who you are.

48:01.080 --> 48:02.320
-[Cade grunts]
-Stop! Stop!

48:02.420 --> 48:04.911
If Byrde's got a million bucks
to toss around,

48:05.000 --> 48:08.083
there's more where that came from,
and you're gonna find it.

48:08.170 --> 48:09.717
Does that clear shit up for you?

48:11.340 --> 48:14.047
-You say, "Yes, Daddy, it does."
-Yes!

48:14.550 --> 48:16.006
-What?
-Yes!

48:42.620 --> 48:45.248
-[Marty] Hey.
-I'm sorry. I didn't mean to wake you.

48:45.330 --> 48:47.036
[Marty] It's okay. I was already up.

48:55.090 --> 48:56.136
How'd it go?

48:58.510 --> 48:59.716
We're gonna lose tomorrow.

49:05.560 --> 49:06.549
What happened?

49:07.400 --> 49:08.264
Wilkes.

49:10.190 --> 49:12.397
He could've helped,
but the price was too high.

49:12.990 --> 49:14.275
What do you mean?
What'd he want?

49:15.860 --> 49:16.736
Me.

49:17.740 --> 49:19.651
[scoffs] He wanted me.

49:33.970 --> 49:35.039
Was that a no?

49:35.130 --> 49:37.007
[shower running]

50:00.080 --> 50:00.899
[horn honking]

50:29.480 --> 50:30.936
[car engine starting]

50:51.540 --> 50:53.542
[chattering]

51:15.650 --> 51:17.060
Hello, Senator.

51:18.280 --> 51:21.067
I've got nothing to say to you
or your boss.

51:21.740 --> 51:22.559
Just curious.

51:22.660 --> 51:25.197
You ever get off that high horse
or you sleep on it?

51:25.290 --> 51:26.939
-What do you want?
-[urinating]

51:27.830 --> 51:30.412
We want you to go on a little trip today.

51:30.500 --> 51:32.320
I'm busy. Big vote.

51:33.750 --> 51:37.914
Wait till you hear what I have to say.
It might change your mood.

51:56.190 --> 51:58.818
[doorbell rings]

52:01.740 --> 52:02.650
[Wilkes] Hey.

52:04.370 --> 52:05.189
Hi.

52:06.700 --> 52:07.780
[Wilkes] Want some coffee?

52:08.830 --> 52:09.649
Yeah.

52:12.330 --> 52:13.911
I didn't sleep well last night.

52:16.210 --> 52:17.666
I never sleep well.

52:18.210 --> 52:20.087
I need to get that bill passed.

52:20.590 --> 52:21.716
I understand.

52:22.220 --> 52:24.506
No, I don't think you do, Charlie.

52:25.680 --> 52:26.840
It's got to pass.

52:30.100 --> 52:31.055
It's done.

52:35.480 --> 52:36.640
We lost?

52:38.730 --> 52:40.311
I thought you said the vote
was this afternoon.

52:41.070 --> 52:43.026
Blake had a sudden family emergency.

52:43.110 --> 52:45.908
He has to go out of town.
He won't be voting today.

52:46.740 --> 52:47.900
You've got your bill.

52:50.620 --> 52:51.575
Really?

52:51.660 --> 52:52.786
[both chuckle]

52:52.870 --> 52:53.825
[Wilkes] Really.

52:59.420 --> 53:01.206
Uh, I don't even know what to say.

53:03.510 --> 53:05.967
Can you tell me what you had on him?

53:06.050 --> 53:08.462
No, don't. Don't. I don't wanna know.

53:08.560 --> 53:10.266
And, Wendy, just so we're clear...

53:11.270 --> 53:13.090
there was never a quid pro quo.

53:14.600 --> 53:17.012
I told you I only support the things
I believe in.

53:19.230 --> 53:21.437
-You don't bel|i\leve in a casino.
- o.

53:22.860 --> 53:24.100
But I believe in you.

53:38.040 --> 53:40.292
-[cel| door buzzing]
-[chattering]

53:46.840 --> 53:49.923
[guard] Garrison, you got a visitor.

53:51.350 --> 53:52.385
A visitor?

53:54.230 --> 53:55.629
Who is it? A lawyer?

53:56.310 --> 53:58.141
[guard] I don't think he's a lawyer.

54:17.290 --> 54:18.370
I know you.

54:19.880 --> 54:22.667
[Petty] Not really. ButI know you.

54:25.300 --> 54:27.086
You hung around the Blue Cat.

54:27.880 --> 54:29.586
[Petty] I've been looking for you.

54:33.600 --> 54:35.511
You disappeared off the grid.

54:36.940 --> 54:40.228
No phone records, no credit card receipts.

54:40.900 --> 54:43.107
So, we put out a flag on you.

54:48.910 --> 54:52.198
Why, Agent Petty?

54:53.330 --> 54:54.649
[Petty] Marty Byrde.

54:56.830 --> 55:01.494
We found over a hundred grand in cash
in a plastic bag in the trunk of your car.

55:03.420 --> 55:05.047
Tell me how it got there.

55:05.130 --> 55:08.714
-I got lucky. I made it gambling.
-You're the opposite of lucky, Rachel.

55:09.220 --> 55:10.630
You know what I think?

55:13.390 --> 55:16.462
I think you stole it from Marty Byrde,
and it's cartel money.

55:21.270 --> 55:25.434
-I think I need to call my lavwer.
-Hmm, sure. Be my guest.

55:26.110 --> 55:28.772
But right now,
you're facing a triple felony.

55:29.900 --> 55:32.983
DUI, possession of a controlled substance,

55:33.070 --> 55:34.981
and reckless endangerment, so...

55:36.370 --> 55:39.828
If you're found guilty, the judge can
apply the three strike law, and...

55:40.960 --> 55:43.030
you could go away for life.

55:49.050 --> 55:50.369
Yeah, but that was an accident.

55:50.470 --> 55:51.880
Even worse.

55:54.390 --> 55:56.346
Word gets out on the street...

55:57.520 --> 56:01.058
[sighs] that you stole cartel money...

56:02.900 --> 56:04.686
how long you think you'd last?

56:07.980 --> 56:09.561
So, you're trying to scare me.

56:15.580 --> 56:16.820
How am I doin'?

56:18.540 --> 56:19.859
Door number three.

56:20.830 --> 56:22.286
We help each other.

56:23.710 --> 56:27.623
We know Marty Byrde launders millions
of dollars a year for the Navarro cartel.

56:27.710 --> 56:30.463
What we need to know are the details
of how he does it.

56:31.670 --> 56:37.757
His books, computer files,
a flow chart, whatever.

56:46.690 --> 56:50.399
But if he knows I stole from him,
then he will never take me back.

56:51.190 --> 56:52.771
Let me take care of that.

56:55.030 --> 56:58.989
Even then, how am I supposed to get
that kind of information from him?

57:03.670 --> 57:04.864
I don't care.

57:06.460 --> 57:08.837
I don't give a shit in what you do,

57:09.420 --> 57:12.878
who you betray, who you hurt,
who you fuck.

57:14.340 --> 57:17.423
But if you don't give me
what I want, Rachel,

57:18.430 --> 57:22.719
you are going to prison
for a very, very long time.
