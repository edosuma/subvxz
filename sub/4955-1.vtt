WEBVTT

02:05.542 --> 02:07.709
Hey, Rod, do they have
nude beaches in Florida?

02:07.794 --> 02:10.419
Where are my magazines?
l'm sure l left them here somewhere.

02:10.505 --> 02:12.172
Leslie!

02:12.257 --> 02:15.551
Leslie, what'd you do
with my gol-darn golf balls?

02:15.635 --> 02:17.302
Fifteen and a half sun block.

02:17.887 --> 02:18.929
Father, could l get
a string bikini in Florida?

02:19.013 --> 02:20.806
Make sure you pack your beach towel.

02:20.890 --> 02:24.184
-Nobody can order pizza in this house.
-Where are my golf balls?

02:24.269 --> 02:27.646
-You know why? 'Cause l'm the only guy...
-Check in your pockets.

02:27.730 --> 02:29.940
All right, has anybody seen my sun block?

02:30.024 --> 02:33.318
What's the point of going to Florida
if you're gonna put on sun block?

02:33.403 --> 02:36.363
l don't care if l age like an old suitcase.
l'm getting toasted.

02:36.447 --> 02:40.284
Great. Now you can be a skag
with a slightly darker shade of skin.

02:40.368 --> 02:44.454
He's just jealous 'cause he can't tan.
His freckles just connect.

02:44.956 --> 02:48.792
Hey, hey, easy on the fluids, pal.
The rubber sheets are packed.

02:49.002 --> 02:53.046
Vicky says she wants to go with "Ding."
Behind "Ding" is 200 points.

02:53.131 --> 02:55.215
All right. Good for you.

02:57.552 --> 03:00.012
Two hundred points. All right.

03:02.932 --> 03:05.184
-Honey, are you packed yet?
-Yes.

03:06.603 --> 03:08.061
Yes

03:09.856 --> 03:13.025
-Everything l put out for you?
-Yes.

03:14.319 --> 03:15.611
Yes

03:16.362 --> 03:18.739
Did you see what Grandma Penelope
sent you for the trip?

03:18.823 --> 03:21.408
Let me guess. Donald Duck slippers?

03:22.452 --> 03:25.954
Close. An inflatable clown
to play with in the pool.

03:26.706 --> 03:28.415
How exciting.

03:29.334 --> 03:32.878
Why do we have to go to Florida?
There's no Christmas trees in Florida.

03:32.962 --> 03:35.047
Kevin, what is it with you
and Christmas trees?

03:35.131 --> 03:38.050
How could you have Christmas
without a Christmas tree, Mom?

03:38.134 --> 03:42.095
We'll find a nice, fake silver one
or decorate a palm tree.

03:43.139 --> 03:44.973
Goodbye, everybody.

03:45.433 --> 03:47.684
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

03:47.769 --> 03:50.562
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

03:50.647 --> 03:53.232
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

03:53.316 --> 03:57.819
For reservations, call toll-free 1-800-759...

03:57.904 --> 04:00.489
Honey, do you know where the batteries
for this camcorder are?

04:00.573 --> 04:02.908
Yeah, l put it in the charger.

04:14.754 --> 04:16.922
-How's this?
-Much better.

04:18.132 --> 04:20.091
Hey, Kevin, you better go put your tie on.

04:20.176 --> 04:22.052
We don't want to be late
for the Christmas pageant.

04:22.136 --> 04:24.304
My tie's in the bathroom.
l can't go in there,

04:24.389 --> 04:26.348
'cause Uncle Frank's taking a shower.

04:26.432 --> 04:28.934
He says if l walked in there
and saw him naked,

04:29.018 --> 04:31.937
l'd grow up never feeling like a real man.

04:32.605 --> 04:34.439
Whatever that means.

04:36.192 --> 04:37.484
l'm sure he was kidding.

04:37.568 --> 04:42.447
Just run in there and get your tie,
get out, and don't look at anything.

04:44.659 --> 04:48.453
Well, this cat they're talking about

04:48.538 --> 04:51.290
l wonder who could it be

04:51.374 --> 04:54.293
'Cause they know l'm the heaviest cat

04:54.377 --> 04:57.713
The heaviest cat you ever did see

04:57.797 --> 05:00.632
When they see me
walking down the street

05:00.717 --> 05:03.427
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey

05:03.511 --> 05:05.554
On their faces they wear a silly smirk

05:05.638 --> 05:11.143
'Cause they know l'm the king
of the cool jerk

05:13.646 --> 05:17.899
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or l'm gonna slap you silly!

05:19.861 --> 05:22.404
You're cooking, Frankie!

05:30.371 --> 05:33.832
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree

05:33.916 --> 05:37.669
Lit up like a star

05:37.754 --> 05:41.089
When l see my Christmas tree

05:41.174 --> 05:44.968
Can loved ones be far?

05:45.053 --> 05:48.388
Christmas tree, I'm certain

05:48.473 --> 05:51.933
Wherever l roam..

05:52.018 --> 05:54.770
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Leslie.

05:54.854 --> 05:57.439
Kevin's solo's coming up. Tell Frank.

05:57.523 --> 06:00.525
Okay. Frank... Frank!

06:05.990 --> 06:09.409
Christmastime means laughter

06:09.494 --> 06:13.205
Toboggans in the snow

06:13.289 --> 06:16.208
Caroling to children

06:16.292 --> 06:18.293
With faces aglow

06:20.213 --> 06:23.673
Stockings on the mantel

06:23.758 --> 06:27.177
A wreath on the door

06:27.261 --> 06:30.722
And my merriest Christmas

06:30.807 --> 06:31.848
Stop it!

06:31.933 --> 06:34.684
Needs just one thing more

06:34.769 --> 06:38.063
Christmas tree, my Christmas tree

06:38.147 --> 06:40.190
Lit up like...

06:54.539 --> 06:55.831
Kevin!

07:03.256 --> 07:06.049
Ladies and gentlemen of the jury,

07:11.764 --> 07:14.099
l'd like to apologize to my family

07:14.183 --> 07:16.393
for whatever displeasure
l might have caused you.

07:16.477 --> 07:17.602
What?

07:17.687 --> 07:20.355
My prank was immature and ill-timed.

07:20.857 --> 07:24.693
lmmature or not,
it was pretty gol-darn hilarious.

07:26.446 --> 07:29.364
l'd also like to apologize to my brother.

07:30.158 --> 07:32.617
Kevin, l'm sorry.

07:34.620 --> 07:37.497
Buzz, that was very nice.

07:42.712 --> 07:46.006
Kevin, do you have something to say?

08:03.316 --> 08:05.942
Beat that, you little trout sniffer.

08:10.531 --> 08:13.783
l'm not sorry!
l did what l did 'cause Buzz humiliated me.

08:13.868 --> 08:16.495
And since he gets away with everything,
l let him have it.

08:16.579 --> 08:18.997
And since you're all so stupid
to believe his lies,

08:19.081 --> 08:22.042
l don't care if your idiotic Florida trip
gets wrecked or not.

08:22.126 --> 08:26.004
Who wants to spend Christmas
in a tropical climate anyway?

08:26.088 --> 08:27.172
Kevin!

08:27.256 --> 08:29.799
Kevin, you walk out of here,
you sleep on the third floor.

08:29.884 --> 08:33.345
-Yeah, with me.
-So what else is new?

08:33.429 --> 08:35.931
You'd better not wreck my trip,
you little sourpuss.

08:36.015 --> 08:38.015
Your dad's paying good money for it.

08:38.100 --> 08:41.436
l wouldn't want to spoil your fun,
Mr. Cheapskate.

08:46.192 --> 08:48.443
What a troubled young man.

08:52.865 --> 08:55.242
They're all a bunch ofjerks.

08:56.619 --> 08:57.744
Hi.

08:59.914 --> 09:01.873
You know, Kevin,
last time we all tried to take a trip

09:01.958 --> 09:04.751
we had a problem
that started just like this.

09:04.835 --> 09:07.003
Yeah, with me getting crapped on.

09:07.088 --> 09:08.713
l don't care for your choice of words.

09:08.798 --> 09:11.508
That's not what happened last time,
that's not what's happening this time.

09:11.592 --> 09:13.718
Buzz apologized to you.

09:13.803 --> 09:16.429
Yeah, then he called me a trout sniffer.

09:16.514 --> 09:19.641
He didn't mean what he said.
He was just sucking up to you.

09:19.725 --> 09:23.687
Okay. Why don't you just sit up here
for a while and think things over?

09:23.771 --> 09:26.481
When you're ready to apologize
to Buzz and to the rest of the family,

09:26.566 --> 09:27.607
you can come down.

09:27.692 --> 09:31.903
l'm not apologizing to Buzz.
l'd rather kiss a toilet seat.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.114
Then you can stay up here
the rest of the night.

09:34.198 --> 09:38.410
Fine. l don't wanna be down there anyway.
l can't trust anybody in this family.

09:38.494 --> 09:40.704
And d'you know what?
lf l had my own money,

09:40.788 --> 09:44.749
l'd go on my own vacation,
alone, without any of you guys.

09:44.834 --> 09:47.627
And l'd have the most fun in my whole life.

09:47.712 --> 09:50.755
Well, you got your wish last year.
Maybe you'll get it again this year.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.424
l hope so.

10:41.223 --> 10:43.725
-We did it again!
-We did it again!

10:53.861 --> 10:56.821
Okay, our McCallisters in the first van,
the other McCallisters in the second van.

10:56.906 --> 10:58.323
l know l shouldn't complain
about a free trip,

10:58.407 --> 11:00.825
but, jeez, you guys give
the worst gol-darn wake-up calls.

11:00.910 --> 11:02.619
-Frank, do you have the tickets?
-l've got them.

11:02.703 --> 11:06.247
-Here's your family's. l've got my family's.
-How many do you have?

11:06.332 --> 11:07.499
-Seven.
-Seven.

11:07.583 --> 11:09.417
-Fourteen.
-Fourteen.

11:12.546 --> 11:17.175
Seven, eight, nine, ten...

11:17.259 --> 11:18.426
How come none of us are sitting together?

11:18.511 --> 11:20.512
At this time of the year,
we're lucky to get on the same plane.

11:20.596 --> 11:23.598
Eleven, twelve, thirteen...

11:25.893 --> 11:27.477
Where's Kevin?

11:28.354 --> 11:29.729
Fourteen.

11:29.814 --> 11:34.693
lt's a good thing l have my own ticket,
just in case you guys try to ditch me.

11:44.662 --> 11:46.579
-Come on, Kevin.
-Dad, l need batteries.

11:46.664 --> 11:49.207
l got some batteries in my bag.
l'll give them to you on the plane.

11:49.291 --> 11:51.418
-Here's two more.
-Why can't l get them now? l can get them.

11:51.502 --> 11:55.922
-Not now, Kevin. What's the gate number?
-H1 7, sir.

11:56.006 --> 11:57.132
-Here you go.
-Thank you.

11:57.216 --> 11:59.300
Hey, you better hurry up. lt's the last gate.

11:59.385 --> 12:00.552
-All the way down.
-Wow.

12:00.636 --> 12:03.471
-Dad, what gate is it?
-H1 7, Buzz. Come on, Kevin.

12:03.556 --> 12:07.600
Kevin, you gonna take my bag?
You take my bag? Come on. Come on.

12:31.625 --> 12:33.960
Watch it, watch it, watch it.

12:34.628 --> 12:39.674
American Airlines flight 226 to New York
is now in the final boarding process.

12:43.596 --> 12:45.346
Come on, come on.

12:47.641 --> 12:55.774
Dad, wait up!

12:56.734 --> 12:58.109
Wait up!

12:59.278 --> 13:00.361
Wait!

13:00.654 --> 13:03.865
-Look out! Look out!
-Come on, come on, come on!

13:09.163 --> 13:10.830
Dad, wait!

13:16.086 --> 13:17.921
Here we are. Here.

13:21.675 --> 13:25.303
-We made it all.
-Everybody here? We made it? All right.

13:25.387 --> 13:27.597
Please, ma'am, you have to board.
The plane is ready to leave.

13:27.681 --> 13:29.265
-Let me just make sure everyone gets on.
-Come on.

13:29.350 --> 13:31.851
Don't worry, ma'am,
we'll get everybody on the flight.

13:31.936 --> 13:34.145
-Merry Christmas. Have a nice flight.
-Merry Christmas.

13:34.230 --> 13:35.897
-Bye.
-Bye-bye.

13:38.776 --> 13:41.945
Hey, wait up! Hey, guys, wait for me!

13:43.906 --> 13:45.615
-Cutting it kind of close.
-Yeah, sorry.

13:45.699 --> 13:47.867
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you.

13:47.952 --> 13:49.452
Dad, wait up!

13:50.496 --> 13:51.663
Wait!

13:53.165 --> 13:54.290
l'm sorry.

13:54.375 --> 13:57.794
-That's all right. Are you on this flight?
-Yeah, so is my family.

13:57.878 --> 14:00.338
They're already on the plane,
and l don't want to be left behind.

14:00.422 --> 14:03.007
-Do you have a boarding pass?
-lt's somewhere.

14:03.092 --> 14:04.551
We have to close up here.
They're ready to go.

14:04.635 --> 14:07.178
-He dropped his boarding pass.
-This plane can't leave.

14:07.263 --> 14:09.931
This happened to me last year
and almost wrecked my Christmas.

14:10.015 --> 14:11.683
Are you sure your family's on this flight?

14:11.767 --> 14:15.311
Yeah. My dad ran in here
right before l bumped into this lady.

14:15.396 --> 14:19.482
Okay, board him, but make sure he locates
his family before you leave him.

14:19.567 --> 14:21.192
Okay. Come on.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.906
Do you see your family?

14:26.991 --> 14:30.702
-There's my dad over there.
-Okay. Well, go find an empty seat.

14:30.786 --> 14:31.911
-Have a merry Christmas.
-You, too.

14:31.996 --> 14:34.581
Ladies and gentlemen, in order
for the captain to push back from the gate,

14:34.665 --> 14:37.625
we need all passengers to be seated
with their seat belts securely fastened.

15:06.196 --> 15:08.823
So, have you ever been to Florida?

15:33.349 --> 15:38.186
Welcome aboard American Airlines
flight 1 76 nonstop to New York...

15:48.864 --> 15:51.908
Boy, l didn't think
we were going to make it.

15:54.078 --> 15:56.412
Something wrong? Honey?

15:57.247 --> 15:59.165
l have that feeling.

15:59.917 --> 16:01.793
We forgot something?

16:02.670 --> 16:06.756
No, l don't think we did, but l...
l just have that feeling.

16:06.840 --> 16:08.466
Bad memories, that's all.

16:08.550 --> 16:12.553
We did everything, we brought everything,
we have everybody.

16:13.180 --> 16:15.598
There's nothing to worry about.

16:17.059 --> 16:21.270
Yeah. Yeah, you're right.
You're right. We're fine.

16:21.897 --> 16:24.148
Nothing to worry about.

16:43.627 --> 16:45.003
Mom?

16:46.422 --> 16:47.839
Dad?

16:48.924 --> 16:50.425
Uncle Frank?

16:52.011 --> 16:53.386
Buzz?

17:01.520 --> 17:04.856
-We're the last ones off the plane.
-Okay, thanks.

17:08.527 --> 17:10.403
Where are those guys?

17:16.577 --> 17:17.743
-Whose is this?
-That's Brooke's.

17:17.828 --> 17:20.329
This is Megan's. Brooke.
Give this to Brooke.

17:20.414 --> 17:24.291
-This to Kevin. Give this to Kevin.
-Give this... Give this to Kevin.

17:24.376 --> 17:26.377
-Give this to Kevin.
-Give this to Kevin.

17:26.462 --> 17:27.878
-Kevin.
-Give this to Kevin.

17:27.963 --> 17:32.508
-Give this to Kevin.
-Give this to Kevin.

17:32.593 --> 17:35.553
-Give this to Kevin.
-Here you go, Kevin.

17:42.311 --> 17:56.657
-Kevin's not here.
-Kevin's not here.

17:57.659 --> 17:58.993
What?

18:02.706 --> 18:04.040
Kevin!

18:32.402 --> 18:35.029
Excuse me, but this is an emergency.

18:36.198 --> 18:39.075
-Yes, sir?
-What city is that over there?

18:41.203 --> 18:45.289
-That's New York, sir.
-Yikes, l did it again.

18:50.379 --> 18:52.380
Something wrong, sir?

18:54.967 --> 18:56.551
l'll be fine.

19:05.894 --> 19:10.064
Oh, no.
My family's in Florida and l'm in New York.

19:11.817 --> 19:14.235
My family's in Florida.

19:15.237 --> 19:18.197
l'm in New York.

19:53.317 --> 19:55.067
Thanks! Bye!

20:28.644 --> 20:30.061
Wow

21:04.846 --> 21:06.555
What's the child's name?

21:06.640 --> 21:09.433
-Kevin. K-E-V-l-N.
-Kevin.

21:09.518 --> 21:12.853
-When did you see him last?
-Curbside check-in?

21:12.938 --> 21:16.732
No, l saw him at the door.
He was with us in the terminal.

21:17.359 --> 21:20.653
Most people get separated
at security checkpoints.

21:20.737 --> 21:23.781
-Did everyone get through security?
-l don't know. Peter?

21:23.865 --> 21:27.702
We were in a hurry. We were in a hurry.
We had to run all the way to the gate.

21:27.786 --> 21:30.413
When did you notice he was missing?

21:31.373 --> 21:34.083
When we picked up our baggage here.

21:35.043 --> 21:36.627
Has the boy ever run away from home?

21:36.712 --> 21:38.129
-No.
-No.

21:38.213 --> 21:42.091
Has he ever been in a situation
where he's been on his own?

21:46.054 --> 21:49.432
As a matter of fact,
this has happened before.

21:49.516 --> 21:53.644
lt's becoming sort of
a McCallister family travel tradition.

21:53.729 --> 21:56.897
Funnily enough, we never lose our luggage.

22:08.785 --> 22:11.912
He was left at home by accident last year.

22:12.748 --> 22:14.248
Yeah, that's what my wife meant

22:14.333 --> 22:18.419
when she said it's becoming
a McCallister family travel tradition.

22:19.838 --> 22:24.300
We'll call Chicago
and notify them of the situation.

22:24.384 --> 22:28.346
-The odds are that's where he is.
-Thanks.

22:28.430 --> 22:31.390
lt's very unlikely he'd be anywhere else.

22:46.823 --> 22:48.783
Watch out, kid!

23:01.171 --> 23:03.297
Yo, where's your manifest?

23:08.387 --> 23:12.306
Here we are, Marv.
New York City, the land of opportunity.

23:13.809 --> 23:16.811
-Smell that?
-Yeah.

23:16.895 --> 23:18.521
-You know what that is?
-Fish.

23:19.856 --> 23:22.733
-lt's freedom.
-No, it's fish.

23:23.402 --> 23:27.738
-lt's freedom, and it's money.
-Okay, okay. lt's freedom.

23:27.823 --> 23:30.574
Come on, let's get out of here
before somebody sees us.

23:30.659 --> 23:32.326
And it's fish.

23:38.291 --> 23:43.421
Yup, one quick score. We get ourselves
a couple of phony passports

23:43.505 --> 23:46.924
and we hightail it to some foreign country.

23:47.008 --> 23:48.509
Arizona?

23:53.682 --> 23:59.270
That's very smart, Marv. You bust out of
jail to rob 14 cents from a Santa Claus?

23:59.354 --> 24:03.441
Every little bit helps.
Besides, now we got our new nickname.

24:04.109 --> 24:06.193
We're the Sticky Bandits.

24:06.862 --> 24:09.864
Real cute. Very cute.

24:26.923 --> 24:30.843
"The Plaza Hotel, New York's
most exciting hotel experience."

24:44.065 --> 24:45.399
Sick.

25:42.832 --> 25:46.293
-What's the matter?
-Thought l saw something.

26:02.185 --> 26:04.895
Serves you right. Come on, let's go!

26:04.980 --> 26:07.064
l think she likes me.

26:44.019 --> 26:45.853
Excuse me. Where's the lobby?

26:45.937 --> 26:48.897
-Down the hall and to the left.
-Thanks.

27:02.621 --> 27:03.912
Wow!

27:12.631 --> 27:15.007
Guests of the new
Celebrity Ding Dang Dong

27:15.091 --> 27:17.843
stay at the world-renowned Plaza Hotel,

27:17.927 --> 27:20.512
New York's most exciting
hotel experience.

27:20.597 --> 27:26.602
For reservations,
call toll-free 1-800-759-3000

27:28.104 --> 27:29.855
l'll do just that.

27:30.982 --> 27:33.817
Howdy-do.
This is Peter McCallister, the father.

27:33.902 --> 27:38.489
l'd like a hotel room, please,
with an extra-large bed, a TV,

27:38.573 --> 27:42.117
and one of those little refrigerators
you have to open with a key.

27:42.202 --> 27:43.952
Credit card? You got it.

27:48.041 --> 27:50.250
Plaza Hotel reservations. May l help you?

27:50.335 --> 27:51.502
Howdy-do.

27:51.586 --> 27:54.922
-This is Peter McCaIIister, the father
-Yes, sir.

27:55.006 --> 27:57.216
-l'd like a hotel room, please...
-Yes.

27:57.300 --> 28:02.429
...with an extra-large bed, a TV,
and one of those little refrigerators

28:02.514 --> 28:04.765
you have to open with a key.

28:04.849 --> 28:06.809
Yes, sir, you'll need
a major credit card upon check-in.

28:07.435 --> 28:09.770
Credit card? You got it.

28:10.605 --> 28:12.940
Thank you. Enjoy your stay.

28:16.277 --> 28:19.446
Yes, two at 8:00, Henri, Mr. Yamamoto.

28:20.323 --> 28:22.199
Hold on a second.

28:26.162 --> 28:28.288
l'll call you back, Henri.

28:30.834 --> 28:32.000
Hi.

28:36.464 --> 28:39.842
-Can l help you?
-Reservation for McCallister?

28:41.845 --> 28:44.054
A reservation for yourself?

28:44.139 --> 28:46.640
Ma'am, my feet are
hardly touching the ground.

28:46.725 --> 28:48.892
l'm barely able to look over this counter.

28:48.977 --> 28:51.562
How could l make a reservation
for a hotel room?

28:51.646 --> 28:57.484
Think about it, a kid going into a hotel,
making a reservation? l don't think so.

28:59.112 --> 29:00.946
l'm confused.

29:01.030 --> 29:04.950
l'm traveling with my dad.
He's on business. He's at a meeting.

29:05.034 --> 29:07.911
l hate meetings,
plus l'm not allowed to go in.

29:07.996 --> 29:12.666
l can only sit in the lobby. That's boring.
So my dad dropped me off here.

29:13.752 --> 29:17.045
He gave me his credit card
and said whoever was checking people in

29:17.130 --> 29:20.591
to let me in the hotel room
so l won't get into mischief,

29:20.675 --> 29:23.677
and, ma'am,
sometimes l do get into mischief.

29:24.971 --> 29:26.430
We all do.

29:29.017 --> 29:30.768
Merry Christmas.

29:32.145 --> 29:33.854
No sign of him.

29:34.481 --> 29:36.356
We're gonna have to be able
to get a hold of you.

29:36.441 --> 29:38.567
-You have hotel arrangements?
-Yeah.

29:38.651 --> 29:41.445
Do you have a recent photo of the boy?

29:43.031 --> 29:45.115
l have one in my wallet.

29:46.159 --> 29:48.202
l don't have my wallet.

29:48.912 --> 29:50.829
My wallet's in my bag.

29:51.414 --> 29:52.998
Kevin was looking in my bag at the airport.

29:53.082 --> 29:55.292
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.

29:55.376 --> 29:58.462
-Did you have credit cards in the wallet?
-Credit cards, money.

29:58.546 --> 30:02.216
We'll notify the credit card companies
immediately. lf your son has the cards,

30:02.300 --> 30:05.844
we can get a location on him
when and if he uses them.

30:05.929 --> 30:08.806
No, l don't think Kevin even knows
how to use a credit card.

30:11.684 --> 30:13.352
Wow! lt worked.

30:17.232 --> 30:18.816
-Cedric.
-Yes?

30:19.234 --> 30:22.402
-Don't count your tips in public.
-l'm sorry.

30:22.946 --> 30:27.074
And find out everything you can
about that young fellow.

30:28.284 --> 30:29.910
Front, please.

30:34.624 --> 30:36.500
Enjoy your stay with us.

30:36.584 --> 30:40.128
And don't forget to remind your dad
when he arrives

30:40.213 --> 30:42.589
that he has to come down
and sign a couple of things.

30:42.674 --> 30:44.883
Thank you. You've been most helpful.

30:44.968 --> 30:47.010
May l take your bag, sir?

30:51.182 --> 30:53.058
Up here to your left.

30:53.560 --> 30:56.353
You know, Herbert Hoover
once stayed here on this floor.

30:56.437 --> 30:59.773
-The vacuum guy?
-No, the president.

31:05.154 --> 31:07.906
This is one of our finest suites, sir.

31:15.999 --> 31:17.708
This is great!

31:23.131 --> 31:26.049
Wow! A huge bed just for me!

31:33.391 --> 31:35.809
Luxurious and spacious.

31:42.483 --> 31:44.151
How convenient!

31:47.488 --> 31:48.655
Hey!

31:51.159 --> 31:54.912
Did you want me to put the key in the bag
or did you just want to hang on to it?

31:54.996 --> 31:56.830
l'll hang on to it.

31:59.918 --> 32:01.585
ls everything all right, sir?

32:01.669 --> 32:04.171
-ls the temperature in the room okay?
-lt's okay.

32:04.255 --> 32:08.300
-Do you know how the TV works?
-l'm 1 0 years old. TV's my life.

32:09.218 --> 32:10.510
Well...

32:14.515 --> 32:16.016
l'm sorry.

32:20.855 --> 32:23.941
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

32:25.902 --> 32:27.361
Thank you.

32:54.806 --> 32:57.975
Would it bother anyone
if l worked on my cannonballs?

32:58.059 --> 32:59.226
No.

33:00.103 --> 33:01.478
Thanks.

33:14.367 --> 33:15.575
Yikes!

33:37.473 --> 33:39.516
This is a vacation.

33:40.685 --> 33:42.978
Hold it right there.

33:43.062 --> 33:44.855
lt's me, Johnny.

33:44.939 --> 33:49.234
l knew it was you.
l could smell you getting off the elevator.

33:50.737 --> 33:54.531
-Two scoops, sir?
-Two? Make it three. l'm not driving.

33:54.615 --> 33:57.075
lt's gardenias, Johnny, your favorite.

33:57.952 --> 33:58.994
Thank you.

33:59.078 --> 34:02.205
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

34:02.290 --> 34:04.708
l was singin' at the Blue Monkey last night.

34:04.792 --> 34:07.544
She was not!
She was smooching with your brother.

34:07.628 --> 34:11.214
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

34:11.299 --> 34:13.175
-That's a dirty, rotten lie, Johnny.
-See?

34:13.259 --> 34:16.386
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

34:16.471 --> 34:21.099
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

34:21.184 --> 34:25.771
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff,
l could go on forever, baby.

34:25.855 --> 34:30.358
-You got me all wrong.
-All right. l believe you,

34:30.443 --> 34:32.360
but my Tommy gun don't!

34:33.196 --> 34:34.487
Johnny!

34:35.114 --> 34:37.032
You're the only duck in my pond!

34:37.116 --> 34:39.868
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

34:39.952 --> 34:42.913
Baby! l'm over the moon for you!

34:42.996 --> 34:45.623
You got to do better than that!

34:45.708 --> 34:47.417
lf my love was an ocean,

34:47.502 --> 34:50.879
Lindy'd have to take
two airplanes to get across it!

34:52.047 --> 34:55.217
Maybe l'm off my hinges, but l believe you.

34:55.967 --> 34:58.220
That's why l'm gonna let you go.

34:58.304 --> 35:00.972
l'm going to give you to the count of three

35:01.057 --> 35:07.687
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

35:08.314 --> 35:10.148
She's rat bait.

35:10.233 --> 35:11.399
One

35:12.485 --> 35:13.819
two,

35:22.745 --> 35:23.912
three!

35:23.996 --> 35:26.540
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

35:28.876 --> 35:30.836
And a happy New Year.

36:03.911 --> 36:05.370
Housekeeping.

36:45.786 --> 36:55.587
We know a cat
who can really do the cool jerk

36:55.671 --> 36:59.633
Well, this cat they talkin' about

36:59.717 --> 37:02.385
l wonder who could it be

37:02.470 --> 37:05.513
'Cause l know l'm the heaviest cat

37:05.598 --> 37:08.183
The heaviest cat you ever did see

37:08.976 --> 37:11.770
When they see me walkin' down the street

37:11.854 --> 37:14.648
When the fellas want to speak
Hey, hey

37:14.732 --> 37:16.858
On their faces, they wear a silly smirk

37:16.943 --> 37:22.322
'Cause they know l'm the king
of the cool jerk

37:26.118 --> 37:30.497
Get out of here, you nosy little pervert,
or l'm gonna slap you silly!

37:33.501 --> 37:36.253
You're cooking, Frankie!

38:12.707 --> 38:15.500
Didn't look this bad on our honeymoon.

38:32.059 --> 38:34.311
Hey! Uncle Rob lives here.

38:34.395 --> 38:37.647
lf they're back from Paris,
l'll drop in on them.

38:37.732 --> 38:40.650
They usually give pretty good presents.

39:39.794 --> 39:41.461
Good night, Mom.

39:46.884 --> 39:48.676
Good night, Kevin.

40:15.621 --> 40:17.414
Your drawers, sir.

40:17.498 --> 40:20.458
Jeez! Don't flash these babies
around here!

40:20.543 --> 40:24.504
-There could be girls on this floor!
-l was very careful, sir.

40:24.588 --> 40:27.257
You can't be too careful
when it involves underwear.

40:27.341 --> 40:31.136
-l understand.
-l'm sorry. You wanted a tip.

40:32.221 --> 40:36.224
That won't be necessary, sir.
l still have some tip left over.

40:37.935 --> 40:40.145
No tip? Okay.

40:41.772 --> 40:43.690
No, no, no! Wait, wait, wait!

40:45.151 --> 40:47.110
Excuse me, how do l get
to Columbus Circle?

40:47.194 --> 40:50.321
The doorman will be happy
to find you a taxi, sir.

40:50.406 --> 40:52.157
Mr. McCallister!

40:55.286 --> 40:57.454
-Excuse me.
-Sure.

41:00.833 --> 41:02.917
And how are we this morning?

41:03.002 --> 41:06.296
-Fine. ls my transportation here?
-Out in front, sir.

41:06.380 --> 41:11.259
A limousine and a pizza,
compliments of the Plaza Hotel.

41:11.343 --> 41:16.139
l do hope your father understands that
last night l was simply checking the room

41:16.223 --> 41:18.308
to make sure everything was in order.

41:18.392 --> 41:20.852
-He was pretty mad.
-He was?

41:20.936 --> 41:22.645
He said he didn't come
all the way to New York

41:22.730 --> 41:27.275
-to get his naked rear end spied on.
-Of course not.

41:27.359 --> 41:30.570
-Will he be down soon?
-He already left.

41:33.574 --> 41:36.993
l would have liked
to have offered my personal apology.

41:37.077 --> 41:41.039
lf some guy looked at you in the shower,
would you ever want to see him again?

41:41.123 --> 41:42.665
l suppose not.

41:42.750 --> 41:45.793
l don't think you'll see him
for the rest of our trip.

41:45.878 --> 41:47.420
l understand.

41:48.422 --> 41:49.589
Bye.

41:52.176 --> 41:53.968
Have a lovely day.

42:03.437 --> 42:05.396
McCallister.

42:18.327 --> 42:21.246
-Morning, Mr. McCallister.
-Good morning.

42:28.295 --> 42:32.674
Mr. McCallister,
here's your very own cheese pizza.

42:55.322 --> 42:57.574
-Hello?
-Hello.

42:57.658 --> 43:00.535
-Know any good toy stores?
-Yes, sir!

43:19.179 --> 43:20.805
Bingo!

43:35.738 --> 43:39.073
Get out of here! Go on, get out!
Get out of here! Go on. Get out of here!

43:39.158 --> 43:41.534
Beat it, beat it, beat it! Get out of here!

43:41.619 --> 43:44.954
Hey, Marv! Get over here!
l got to talk to you!

43:55.424 --> 43:57.050
Whoa! Whoa!

43:59.553 --> 44:02.180
-Would you like a scarf?
-You wanna forget about the scarf, Marv?

44:02.264 --> 44:03.890
We got to talk.

44:04.433 --> 44:06.934
We don't have the equipment
to pull off anything big,

44:07.019 --> 44:09.187
you know, your banks,
yourjewelry stores.

44:09.271 --> 44:12.732
We don't want goods.
We need cash, and we need it now.

44:13.484 --> 44:18.154
How about hotels?
Tourists carry lots of cash.

44:18.238 --> 44:20.865
There's no guarantees. l got a better idea.

44:20.949 --> 44:23.576
Stores ain't gonna deposit cash
on Christmas Eve.

44:23.661 --> 44:25.995
The only stores that are
gonna have cash on hand

44:26.080 --> 44:28.790
are the ones that deal
in moderate-priced goods.

44:28.874 --> 44:30.291
Right, right.

44:30.376 --> 44:34.170
Ergo, what store's gonna make
the most cash on Christmas Eve

44:34.254 --> 44:36.964
that nobody's going to think to rob?

44:37.049 --> 44:38.591
Candy stores.

44:39.426 --> 44:44.681
Nine-year-olds rob candy stores, Marv.
This is what l had in mind.

44:46.475 --> 44:49.102
That's brilliant, Harry. Brilliant!

44:50.771 --> 44:55.400
Yep. There's nobody dumb enough
to knock off a toy store on Christmas Eve.

44:55.484 --> 44:57.151
Yes, there is.

45:15.462 --> 45:18.297
Here we are, sir, Duncan's Toy Chest.

45:19.967 --> 45:22.051
Merry Christmas, Kevin.

46:04.720 --> 46:07.597
This is the greatest accident of my life.

46:25.908 --> 46:27.575
Marv. Marv!

46:28.202 --> 46:30.703
Hey, nice house,
but there's no bathroom in it.

46:33.999 --> 46:37.960
-All right, so what's the plan?
-Everybody leaves for a nice holiday off.

46:38.045 --> 46:40.588
We come out of our little houses...

46:43.550 --> 46:45.843
-Yeah, then what?
-We empty the registers

46:45.928 --> 46:49.555
-and walk out like we own the joint.
-Great plan, Harry!

46:50.390 --> 46:51.432
Shake his hand.

46:51.517 --> 46:53.893
Well, now, thank you
and merry Christmas.

46:53.977 --> 46:56.145
Say hello to the family.

46:57.940 --> 46:59.857
Yes. Let me see.

47:02.319 --> 47:03.986
You shopping alone?

47:04.071 --> 47:07.532
ln New York?
Sir, l'm afraid of my own shadow.

47:07.616 --> 47:10.827
-Now, l was just checking.
-That's very responsible of you.

47:10.911 --> 47:13.579
-Well, thank you.
-My pleasure.

47:14.373 --> 47:18.042
That'll be $23.75.

47:20.379 --> 47:23.422
My, my, my!
Where did you get all that money?

47:25.259 --> 47:27.552
l have a lot of grandmothers.

47:28.136 --> 47:30.179
Well, that explains it.

47:31.974 --> 47:36.352
This is a really nice store, one of the finer
toy dealerships l've ever visited in my life.

47:36.436 --> 47:39.856
-Well, thank you.
-This Mr. Duncan must be a pretty nice guy

47:39.940 --> 47:43.192
letting all the kids come into his store
and play with all his toys.

47:43.277 --> 47:45.278
Most toy stores prohibit that, you know.

47:45.362 --> 47:46.696
-ls that so?
-Yep.

47:46.780 --> 47:53.119
Well, he loves kids. As a matter of fact,
all the money the store takes in today,

47:53.662 --> 47:57.123
Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the children's hospital.

47:57.207 --> 48:02.670
And the day after Christmas, we empty
out all the money in the cash register

48:02.754 --> 48:06.215
and Mr. Duncan just takes it
right down to the hospital.

48:06.300 --> 48:10.636
-That's very generous of him.
-Well, children bring him a lot ofjoy.

48:11.471 --> 48:14.390
As they do to everyone
who appreciates them.

48:20.355 --> 48:24.066
l'm not supposed to spend this money,
but l have $20 from shoveling snow

48:24.151 --> 48:27.570
in a jar in our garage
where my older brother can't find it.

48:27.654 --> 48:29.739
So l can pay my mother back with that.

48:29.823 --> 48:33.993
So you can give this to Mr. Duncan.
The hospital needs it more than l do.

48:34.077 --> 48:38.998
Besides, l'm probably gonna spend it
on stuff that'll rot my teeth and my mind.

48:41.501 --> 48:44.170
That's very sweet of you.

48:45.672 --> 48:47.882
You see that tree there?

48:47.966 --> 48:51.594
Well, to show our appreciation
for your generosity,

48:51.678 --> 48:56.265
l'm going to let you select an object from
that tree that you can take home with you.

48:56.350 --> 48:58.851
-For free?
-Yeah.

48:58.936 --> 49:02.021
-May l make a suggestion?
-Okay.

49:02.105 --> 49:04.357
Take the turtledoves.

49:04.900 --> 49:08.235
-l could have two?
-Well, two turtledoves.

49:08.779 --> 49:12.990
And l'll tell you what you do.
You keep one,

49:13.075 --> 49:16.869
and you give the other one
to a very special person.

49:17.371 --> 49:22.083
You see, turtledoves are a symbol
of friendship and love.

49:23.210 --> 49:26.879
Now, as long as each of you
have your turtledove,

49:26.964 --> 49:29.757
you'll be friends forever.

49:29.841 --> 49:34.011
Wow! l never knew that.
l thought they were just part of a song.

49:34.096 --> 49:38.432
They are, and for that very special reason.

49:38.517 --> 49:41.394
Wow! Thanks.

49:41.478 --> 49:45.147
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas to you, too.

49:45.232 --> 49:49.068
Be sure to bundle up if you go outside.
lt's a little nippy.

49:49.152 --> 49:51.278
Thank you, l'll do that.

50:28.316 --> 50:29.942
Well, where to?

50:30.485 --> 50:34.280
Well, you promised you'd take me
to the Central Park Zoo.

50:41.788 --> 50:44.457
Hey! Look who it is, Marv.

50:48.086 --> 50:50.171
Come on. Let's get him.

50:52.466 --> 50:53.591
Hey!

50:55.552 --> 50:57.053
Hiya, pal.

51:16.198 --> 51:17.573
Come on!

51:32.839 --> 51:34.090
Hey!

51:39.346 --> 51:41.180
Hey! Watch it, man!

51:43.225 --> 51:45.267
Buy now and avoid the Christmas rush.

51:45.352 --> 51:48.979
Two for $5, two for $5. Four for 1 0.

51:49.064 --> 51:51.774
-All right, kiddo.
-There he is!

51:51.858 --> 51:53.692
All right, kiddo!

51:53.777 --> 51:55.319
-Thanks.
-Merry Christmas.

51:55.403 --> 51:57.071
-Hey, hey!
-Whoa!

51:57.989 --> 51:59.323
Excuse me!

52:32.440 --> 52:33.649
Yes!

52:34.276 --> 52:36.735
-Thank you for your suggestion.
-My duty, my pleasure.

52:36.820 --> 52:38.154
Bye now.

52:49.457 --> 52:52.168
You got to help me!
There's two guys after me!

52:52.252 --> 52:53.586
What's the matter?

52:53.670 --> 52:58.507
Store wouldn't take
your stolen credit card?

52:59.342 --> 53:02.595
Let's see what the police
have to say about this.

53:08.018 --> 53:09.810
Get up! Get up!

53:11.146 --> 53:13.230
Come on! Let's go get him!

53:14.774 --> 53:17.610
Get back here, you little thief!

53:20.322 --> 53:22.114
Stop that child!

53:25.285 --> 53:26.619
Grab him!

53:41.134 --> 53:42.801
You little...

53:45.263 --> 53:47.640
l've committed credit card fraud.

53:47.724 --> 53:49.433
Get me security!

53:50.018 --> 53:52.811
We've got to stop that delinquent!

53:53.146 --> 53:55.439
Come along, Cedric.

54:14.626 --> 54:17.670
l've had enough of this vacation.
l'm going home.

54:29.140 --> 54:31.016
Hold it right there.

54:32.394 --> 54:34.603
This is the concierge, sir.

54:35.397 --> 54:39.775
l knew it was you.
l could smell you getting off the elevator.

54:42.070 --> 54:45.030
You was here last night, too, wasn't you?

54:46.491 --> 54:49.493
Yes, sir, l was.

54:50.245 --> 54:53.831
You was here,
and you was smooching with my brother!

54:55.917 --> 54:59.628
l'm... l'm afraid you're mistaken, sir.

54:59.713 --> 55:02.965
Don't give me that.
You been smooching with everybody!

55:03.049 --> 55:07.636
Snuffy, Al, Leo,
Little Mo with the gimpy leg,

55:07.721 --> 55:09.972
Cheeks, Bony Bob, Cliff...

55:14.144 --> 55:15.269
No!

55:16.396 --> 55:17.980
lt's a lie!

55:18.064 --> 55:20.774
l could go on forever, baby.

55:20.859 --> 55:25.779
l'm terribly sorry, sir,
but l'm afraid you're mistaken.

55:25.864 --> 55:27.823
We're looking for a young man.

55:27.907 --> 55:30.617
All right. l believe you,

55:30.702 --> 55:32.619
but my Tommy gun don't!

55:33.580 --> 55:36.749
Get down on your knees
and tell me you love me.

55:39.461 --> 55:41.253
On your knees.

55:49.763 --> 55:51.764
l love you.

55:55.393 --> 55:57.811
You got to do better than that!

55:58.855 --> 56:00.939
-l love you!
-l love you!

56:02.609 --> 56:05.986
Maybe l'm off my hinges, but l believe you.

56:06.071 --> 56:08.489
That's why l'm gonna let you go.

56:09.282 --> 56:11.992
l'm going to give you to the count of three

56:12.077 --> 56:18.749
to get your lousy, lying, lowdown,
four-flushing carcass out my door!

56:20.460 --> 56:22.086
-One...
-Open up the door!

56:22.170 --> 56:23.587
two,

56:37.560 --> 56:38.852
three!

56:39.354 --> 56:42.064
Merry Christmas, you filthy animal.

56:44.901 --> 56:46.985
And a happy New Year.

56:49.489 --> 56:52.908
Stay in your rooms! This is an emergency!

56:52.992 --> 56:55.953
There's an insane guest with a gun!

57:06.798 --> 57:09.341
No!

57:11.511 --> 57:13.303
Come to Papa!

57:15.515 --> 57:19.268
Round trip to Miami. What's the matter,
get on the wrong plane, squirt?

57:19.352 --> 57:20.894
Looks like you won't be needing this, kid.

57:21.396 --> 57:24.231
American don't fly
to the promised land, little buddy.

57:24.315 --> 57:25.607
Come on!

57:27.569 --> 57:31.905
We spent nine months in jail thinking
we had the worst luck in the universe.

57:31.990 --> 57:33.490
We were wrong, little buddy.

57:33.575 --> 57:35.951
We're busted out of the clink,
and we're doing fine.

57:36.035 --> 57:39.329
We're gonna be doing even better because
we're not robbing houses anymore.

57:39.414 --> 57:40.998
Now we're robbing toy stores.

57:41.082 --> 57:44.168
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

57:44.252 --> 57:46.170
Five floors of cash.

57:46.254 --> 57:48.422
Then after that, we grab
a couple of phony passports...

57:48.506 --> 57:52.050
-Marv! Marv, you want to shut up?
-What's the difference?

57:52.135 --> 57:57.556
He's not going to talk to anybody
except maybe a fish. Or the undertaker.

57:57.640 --> 58:02.936
Let's just get him to the subway tunnel.
l'll feel a lot better once we get him on ice.

58:04.606 --> 58:06.148
l've got a gun in my pocket.

58:06.232 --> 58:10.777
You open your mouth, and you'll be
spitting gum out through your forehead.

58:30.798 --> 58:32.424
Well, hello.

58:35.553 --> 58:38.347
-He did it!
-Did what?

58:41.351 --> 58:42.684
Thanks!

58:45.772 --> 58:48.190
-Get him, will you!
-He went in the park.

58:48.274 --> 58:51.068
What are you doing flirting? Get him.

59:25.144 --> 59:26.687
Over there!

59:31.192 --> 59:33.193
-Quit it! Hey!
-Creep!

59:34.279 --> 59:36.655
-Give me that!
-What are you doing?

59:36.739 --> 59:38.240
-Hey, Harry.
-What?

59:38.324 --> 59:39.700
-l got him.
-Wait, let me see.

59:39.784 --> 59:43.287
That ain't him. Get down. Put him down.
Put him down. That ain't him.

59:43.371 --> 59:45.414
We should've shot him
when we had the chance.

59:45.498 --> 59:47.833
l hate pulling a job,
knowing that little creep is on the loose.

59:47.917 --> 59:50.586
What can he do? He's a kid.
Kids are helpless.

59:50.670 --> 59:53.046
-Not this kid.
-Yeah, but this time he doesn't have

59:53.131 --> 59:56.216
a house full of dangerous goodies
to get us with.

59:56.301 --> 01:00:00.345
He's in the Park. He's alone.
Kids are scared of the Park.

01:00:00.430 --> 01:00:03.599
Yeah. Grown men come in the Park
and don't leave alive.

01:00:03.683 --> 01:00:04.850
Yeah.

01:00:05.518 --> 01:00:07.686
Good luck, little fella.

01:00:18.364 --> 01:00:22.326
l want to go home. Mom, where are you?

01:00:52.607 --> 01:00:54.232
Turn that down!

01:00:56.069 --> 01:00:57.319
-Hello?
-Kate McCallister, please.

01:00:57.403 --> 01:00:59.154
-This is she.
-Ma'am, we found your son.

01:00:59.238 --> 01:01:00.822
-Oh, my God!
-What?

01:01:00.907 --> 01:01:02.532
-lt's the police. They know where Kevin is.
-What?

01:01:02.617 --> 01:01:04.493
-Where?
-He's in New York City.

01:01:04.577 --> 01:01:06.703
-He's in New York!
-New York?

01:01:08.122 --> 01:01:09.915
-...your husband's credit cards...
-What?

01:01:09.999 --> 01:01:11.416
Well, l'm sure he was scared.
He's not a troublemaker.

01:01:12.126 --> 01:01:13.543
-What? What?
-Ma'am, the New York police...

01:01:13.628 --> 01:01:15.671
-Just a second. Please hold.
-Yes, I'll hold...

01:01:15.755 --> 01:01:18.382
He used your credit card
to check into the Plaza Hotel.

01:01:18.466 --> 01:01:20.342
-Do they still have him?
-Do they have him?

01:01:20.426 --> 01:01:22.803
-No, the police are still looking for him.
-Damn it!

01:01:22.887 --> 01:01:24.262
Get to New York
as soon as possible, ma'am.

01:01:24.347 --> 01:01:26.431
Yeah, okay, we're on the next flight out.
Thank you.

01:01:26.516 --> 01:01:27.974
We're going to New York, move it!

01:01:28.059 --> 01:01:30.477
-Yes!
-Party time!

01:01:30.561 --> 01:01:33.188
He ran away from the hotel
when they questioned him about the card.

01:01:33.272 --> 01:01:35.023
He must be so scared, Peter!

01:01:35.108 --> 01:01:37.109
l wonder if he'd know enough
to go to my brother's place?

01:01:37.193 --> 01:01:39.903
-Aren't they in Paris?
-Maybe they have a house sitter.

01:01:39.987 --> 01:01:41.780
l thought you said they were renovating?

01:02:21.821 --> 01:02:28.660
Hello? Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!
Anybody home?

01:02:29.996 --> 01:02:32.914
Hello! Anybody home?

01:02:33.374 --> 01:02:36.001
lt's me, your favorite nephew, Kevin!

01:02:36.919 --> 01:02:40.338
Uncle Rob! Aunt Georgette!

01:03:23.966 --> 01:03:25.801
Watch it, kid!

01:03:31.766 --> 01:03:36.061
Hey, you looking for somebody
to read you a bedtime story?

01:03:41.859 --> 01:03:43.276
Taxi!

01:03:56.207 --> 01:03:58.750
Boy, it's scary out there.

01:04:00.086 --> 01:04:02.420
Ain't much better in here, kid.

01:04:29.115 --> 01:04:32.492
l don't want to ever take a vacation
like this again.

01:05:02.648 --> 01:05:04.524
Where did all you guys come from?

01:05:04.609 --> 01:05:06.568
l don't know if l have
enough for everybody.

01:05:06.652 --> 01:05:08.778
How hungry are you guys?

01:05:10.489 --> 01:05:12.699
You guys ate all my food.

01:06:11.759 --> 01:06:17.013
Look, l'm sorry l screamed in your face.
You were just trying to help me, right?

01:06:20.393 --> 01:06:22.394
l'm Kevin McCallister.

01:06:23.145 --> 01:06:25.230
Your birds are real nice.

01:06:25.898 --> 01:06:29.776
l've seen you before.
You had pigeons all over you.

01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:34.322
At first, you look kind of scary,
but when l think about it, it's not so bad.

01:06:34.407 --> 01:06:37.951
They must be all over you
'cause they like you.

01:06:38.786 --> 01:06:42.414
lf l'm bothering you, l can leave.
Am l bothering you?

01:06:44.291 --> 01:06:45.458
No.

01:06:46.502 --> 01:06:49.087
Good. l'm not a pain in the butt?

01:06:51.132 --> 01:06:52.298
No.

01:06:56.929 --> 01:07:01.391
Will those pigeons come back
on their own or do you have to call them?

01:07:11.444 --> 01:07:13.361
Give me your hand.

01:07:16.824 --> 01:07:18.658
They can hear it.

01:07:35.760 --> 01:07:37.635
This is great!

01:07:41.307 --> 01:07:42.849
lt's pretty cold out.

01:07:42.933 --> 01:07:48.063
l could sure go for a cup of hot chocolate.
How about you? My treat.

01:07:52.735 --> 01:07:55.487
l'd hate to spend Christmas Eve
in such a park.

01:07:55.571 --> 01:07:57.739
Can we go someplace warm?

01:07:57.823 --> 01:08:00.158
Yes. l know a place.

01:08:47.581 --> 01:08:49.499
Nice music.

01:08:51.001 --> 01:08:53.336
This place is great.

01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:56.631
l've heard the world's
great music from here.

01:08:58.008 --> 01:09:03.720
Ella Fitzgerald. Count Basie.
Frank Sinatra. Luciano Pavarotti.

01:09:09.895 --> 01:09:12.729
So, do you bring your friends up here?

01:09:13.858 --> 01:09:16.859
-l haven't got many friends.
-Sorry.

01:09:18.487 --> 01:09:20.822
l'm like the birds l care for.

01:09:21.698 --> 01:09:25.827
People pass me in the street.
They see me but they try to ignore me.

01:09:25.911 --> 01:09:28.537
They prefer l wasn't part of their city.

01:09:28.622 --> 01:09:33.751
Yeah. lt's sort of like that with my family.
l'm kind of the pigeon of the house

01:09:33.836 --> 01:09:36.129
just because l'm the youngest.

01:09:36.212 --> 01:09:38.590
Everyone fights for position.

01:09:38.674 --> 01:09:41.426
Everybody wants to be seen and heard.

01:09:42.051 --> 01:09:45.388
l guess so.
l'm seen and heard pretty much.

01:09:45.471 --> 01:09:48.433
But then l get sent to my room a lot, too.

01:09:50.810 --> 01:09:53.062
l wasn't always like this, you know.

01:09:53.147 --> 01:09:55.315
What were you like before?

01:09:56.275 --> 01:10:00.278
l had a job. l had a home. l had a family.

01:10:00.946 --> 01:10:06.409
-Did you have any kids?
-No. Oh, l wanted them.

01:10:07.620 --> 01:10:10.872
But the man l loved
fell out of love with me.

01:10:11.957 --> 01:10:13.750
That broke my heart.

01:10:14.251 --> 01:10:19.047
And whenever the chance to be loved
came along again, l ran away from it.

01:10:20.424 --> 01:10:22.508
l stopped trusting people.

01:10:22.593 --> 01:10:26.888
No offense, but that seems like
sort of a dumb thing to do.

01:10:26.972 --> 01:10:30.225
l was afraid of getting
my heart broken again.

01:10:30.309 --> 01:10:32.936
You see, sometimes
you can trust a person,

01:10:33.020 --> 01:10:36.564
and then, when things are down,
they forget about you.

01:10:37.775 --> 01:10:39.567
Maybe they're just too busy.

01:10:39.652 --> 01:10:43.571
Maybe they don't forget about you,
but they forget to remember you.

01:10:43.656 --> 01:10:47.659
l don't think people mean to forget.
l think it just happens.

01:10:47.743 --> 01:10:52.538
My grandfather says if my head wasn't
screwed on, l'd leave it on the school bus.

01:10:52.623 --> 01:10:56.626
l'm just afraid if l do trust someone,
l'll get my heart broken again.

01:10:56.710 --> 01:10:58.211
l understand that.

01:10:58.295 --> 01:11:00.755
l used to have this
really nice pair of rollerblades.

01:11:00.839 --> 01:11:05.093
l was afraid if l wore them, l'd wreck them.
So l kept them in a box.

01:11:05.177 --> 01:11:06.886
-Do you know what happened?
-No.

01:11:06.971 --> 01:11:10.181
l outgrew them.
l never wore them once outside.

01:11:10.266 --> 01:11:13.434
l just wore them in my room
a couple times.

01:11:13.519 --> 01:11:18.189
A person's heart and a person's feelings
are very different than skates.

01:11:18.274 --> 01:11:20.400
Well, they're kind of the same thing.

01:11:20.484 --> 01:11:24.112
lf you aren't going to use your heart, then
what's the difference if it gets broken?

01:11:24.196 --> 01:11:27.865
lf you just keep it to yourself,
maybe it'll be like my rollerblades.

01:11:27.950 --> 01:11:31.452
When you do decide to try it,
it won't be any good.

01:11:31.537 --> 01:11:34.872
You should take a chance.
Got nothing to lose.

01:11:35.874 --> 01:11:38.042
A bit of truth in there somewhere.

01:11:38.127 --> 01:11:42.797
l think so. Your heart might
still be broken, but it isn't gone.

01:11:42.881 --> 01:11:45.800
lf it was gone, you wouldn't be this nice.

01:11:46.385 --> 01:11:48.428
Thank you.

01:11:50.014 --> 01:11:55.351
Do you know that it's been a couple
of years since l've talked to anybody?

01:11:56.228 --> 01:11:58.187
That's okay. You're really good at it.

01:11:58.272 --> 01:12:01.232
You're not boring.
You don't mumble or spit when you talk.

01:12:01.317 --> 01:12:03.276
You should do it more often.

01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:07.989
l think you just have to wear an outfit
that doesn't have pigeon poop on it.

01:12:09.908 --> 01:12:13.453
l have been working very hard
at keeping people away, haven't l?

01:12:13.537 --> 01:12:16.247
l always think l'll have
a lot of fun if l'm alone,

01:12:16.332 --> 01:12:19.167
but when l'm alone,
it isn't that much fun at all.

01:12:19.251 --> 01:12:21.961
l don't care how much
people bug me sometimes,

01:12:22.046 --> 01:12:25.465
l'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.

01:12:25.549 --> 01:12:29.010
So what are you doing running around the
streets on Christmas Eve on your own?

01:12:29.094 --> 01:12:31.220
Did you get into trouble?

01:12:31.555 --> 01:12:34.140
-Yeah.
-You've done something wrong?

01:12:34.224 --> 01:12:37.143
A lot of things.

01:12:38.228 --> 01:12:42.065
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

01:12:42.149 --> 01:12:45.068
lt's getting pretty late.
l don't know if l'll have enough time

01:12:45.152 --> 01:12:48.321
to do all the good deeds l need
to erase all the bad ones l did.

01:12:48.405 --> 01:12:51.866
Well, it's Christmas Eve.
Good deeds count for extra tonight.

01:12:51.950 --> 01:12:54.702
-They do?
-Of course they do.

01:12:54.787 --> 01:12:57.538
So what you must do now is you must
think of the most important thing

01:12:57.623 --> 01:13:00.875
that you can do for others
and go and do it.

01:13:00.959 --> 01:13:04.045
Just follow the star in your own heart.

01:13:05.589 --> 01:13:06.839
Okay.

01:13:07.800 --> 01:13:11.469
lt's getting pretty late. l'd better get going.

01:13:17.768 --> 01:13:21.312
lf l don't see you again,
l hope everything turns out okay.

01:13:21.397 --> 01:13:23.439
Thank you.

01:13:23.524 --> 01:13:26.609
-Say goodbye to your birds for me.
-l will.

01:13:35.035 --> 01:13:37.995
-Merry Christmas.
-Merry Christmas.

01:13:38.080 --> 01:13:41.416
lf you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:44.419
l won't forget to remember you.

01:13:44.503 --> 01:13:47.130
Don't make promises you can't keep.

01:14:45.856 --> 01:14:47.940
All the money in the cash registers,

01:14:48.025 --> 01:14:52.153
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.

01:14:52.237 --> 01:14:55.865
At midnight tonight,
we're hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

01:14:55.949 --> 01:15:00.620
You can mess with a lot of things, but
you can't mess with kids on Christmas.

01:17:21.678 --> 01:17:25.473
We'd like to offer you
a complimentary suite while you're here.

01:17:25.557 --> 01:17:29.143
lt's a penthouse with a view of the Park.
l think you'll find it satisfactory.

01:17:29.227 --> 01:17:33.147
lt was recently vacated
by the Countess of Worcestershire.

01:17:33.231 --> 01:17:36.275
What kind of hotel allows
a child to check in alone?

01:17:36.360 --> 01:17:38.819
The boy had a very convincing story.

01:17:38.904 --> 01:17:41.781
What kind of idiots
do you have working here?

01:17:41.865 --> 01:17:43.824
The finest in New York.

01:17:44.743 --> 01:17:47.370
Well, l mean, when you discovered
that the credit card was stolen...

01:17:47.454 --> 01:17:49.330
l made the discovery.

01:17:49.414 --> 01:17:51.832
Why did you let him leave?

01:17:51.917 --> 01:17:55.378
-We attempted to confront him, he ran.
-You scared him away.

01:17:55.462 --> 01:17:58.381
lt's Christmas Eve, and because of you,
our child is lost

01:17:58.465 --> 01:18:01.342
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

01:18:03.261 --> 01:18:06.222
Now could you take our family
and our luggage up to the room, please.

01:18:06.306 --> 01:18:09.350
-Yes, sir!
-Run along, Cedric.

01:18:09.434 --> 01:18:11.060
l'm going to go down to
the police station and make sure

01:18:11.144 --> 01:18:12.853
that they're doing everything
in their power to find Kevin.

01:18:12.938 --> 01:18:14.689
l want you to stay here
with Frank, Leslie and the kids.

01:18:14.773 --> 01:18:17.233
-No, l'm going out to look for him.
-What?

01:18:17.317 --> 01:18:19.944
With all due respect, madam,
your son is lost

01:18:20.028 --> 01:18:22.863
in one of the biggest cities in the world.

01:18:22.948 --> 01:18:25.282
Could you stay out of this please?

01:18:25.367 --> 01:18:27.451
-As you wish.
-Thank you.

01:18:27.536 --> 01:18:29.787
l don't think it's a good idea
for you to start running around

01:18:29.871 --> 01:18:33.624
-all over New York City all by yourself.
-l think if our son can do it, l can do it.

01:18:33.709 --> 01:18:34.875
-Kate...
-Peter, l'll be fine.

01:18:34.960 --> 01:18:39.463
The way l'm feeling right now, no mugger
or murderer would dare mess with me.

01:18:39.548 --> 01:18:43.759
Madam, there are hundreds of parasites
out there armed to the teeth!

01:18:45.595 --> 01:18:48.639
Do bundle up. lt's awfully cold outside.

01:19:23.216 --> 01:19:25.593
Marv. Marv. Come on, let's go.

01:19:46.907 --> 01:19:49.408
Marv. Crowbars up!

01:19:55.916 --> 01:19:58.042
Merry Christmas, Harry!

01:20:02.047 --> 01:20:04.423
Happy Hanukkah, Marv!

01:20:14.059 --> 01:20:16.977
Oh, this is more money
than l can even count!

01:20:17.062 --> 01:20:21.273
lt makes you wonder why we spent
so much time robbing private homes.

01:20:34.913 --> 01:20:37.998
The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law,

01:20:38.083 --> 01:20:42.753
we're up to our elbows in cash and
there's nobody that even knows about it.

01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:48.300
He's back!

01:20:49.594 --> 01:20:52.721
-He took our picture!
-How did my hair look?

01:20:59.145 --> 01:21:01.605
This is it. No turning back.

01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:05.109
Another Christmas in the trenches.

01:21:06.319 --> 01:21:08.320
No!

01:21:13.785 --> 01:21:14.994
Wow

01:21:15.078 --> 01:21:19.456
That's it! Get the money! Get the money!
l'll kill him! That little...

01:21:27.257 --> 01:21:30.843
-l'm coming, Harry!
-Marv!

01:21:38.476 --> 01:21:39.894
Harry?

01:21:42.480 --> 01:21:45.524
Harry! That was incredible.

01:21:49.404 --> 01:21:52.031
-l twisted my ankle on that board there.
-Where is he?

01:21:52.115 --> 01:21:54.325
Hey, guys! Smile!

01:21:57.120 --> 01:21:58.787
Come on! Come on!

01:21:58.872 --> 01:22:01.707
-Help me.
-l got you. l got you.

01:22:29.611 --> 01:22:30.903
Taxi!

01:22:36.701 --> 01:22:38.369
Times Square.

01:22:59.933 --> 01:23:01.892
Where'd he go?

01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:04.728
l'm up here! Come and get me!

01:23:06.773 --> 01:23:09.858
-Let's kill!
-Hold on, pea-brain.

01:23:09.943 --> 01:23:12.277
We got busted last time
because we underestimated

01:23:12.362 --> 01:23:13.946
that little bundle of misery.

01:23:14.030 --> 01:23:16.573
This ain't like the last time.
This ain't his house.

01:23:16.658 --> 01:23:19.702
The kid's running scared.
He ain't got a plan.

01:23:20.453 --> 01:23:22.705
May l do the thinking, please?

01:23:24.290 --> 01:23:25.916
Thank you.

01:23:27.877 --> 01:23:30.504
-Sonny!
-Yes?

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:34.717
Nothing would thrill me
more greatly than to shoot you.

01:23:34.801 --> 01:23:39.888
Knocking off a youngster ain't going
to mean all that much to me. Understand?

01:23:39.973 --> 01:23:43.684
But since we're in a hurry,
l'll make a deal with you.

01:23:43.768 --> 01:23:48.397
You throw down your camera
and we won't hurt you.

01:23:48.481 --> 01:23:52.401
You'll never hear from us again. Okay?

01:23:52.777 --> 01:23:57.948
-You promise?
-l cross my heart and hope to die.

01:23:58.783 --> 01:24:00.576
Okay!

01:24:05.874 --> 01:24:08.459
Okay, kid, give it to me.

01:24:17.469 --> 01:24:18.969
Direct hit!

01:24:24.517 --> 01:24:27.311
How many fingers am l holding up, Marv?

01:24:29.272 --> 01:24:30.647
Eight?

01:24:33.902 --> 01:24:37.571
Okay, kid. You want to throw bricks?
Go ahead, throw another one.

01:24:37.655 --> 01:24:39.239
Don't do that!

01:24:43.495 --> 01:24:47.539
lf you can't do any better than that, kid,
you're going to lose.

01:24:48.708 --> 01:24:51.168
Harry, no.

01:24:57.842 --> 01:24:59.927
You got any more?

01:25:02.514 --> 01:25:05.182
Come on, Marv. Get up. He don't have
any more bricks. He's out of them.

01:25:12.065 --> 01:25:19.696
What?

01:25:22.575 --> 01:25:25.369
That did it! Nobody throws bricks
at me and gets away with it.

01:25:25.453 --> 01:25:29.456
Come on, Marv. Get up.
You go this way. l'm going round the back.

01:25:33.545 --> 01:25:41.009
Harry?

01:28:06.864 --> 01:28:09.866
Harry! l've reached the top!

01:29:03.129 --> 01:29:05.797
You gotta do better than this, kid.

01:29:30.156 --> 01:29:32.783
Wow! What a hole.

01:29:55.139 --> 01:29:56.473
Whoa!

01:33:41.324 --> 01:33:42.866
Harry.

01:34:03.763 --> 01:34:05.472
l'm coming up!

01:34:20.321 --> 01:34:22.614
l'm going to murder that kid!

01:34:40.716 --> 01:34:41.925
Yes!

01:34:48.808 --> 01:34:50.100
Whoa.

01:34:58.818 --> 01:35:01.069
Whoa, whoa!

01:35:11.622 --> 01:35:12.872
Hey!

01:35:13.249 --> 01:35:16.292
Don't you know a kid always wins
against two idiots?

01:35:16.377 --> 01:35:19.003
Harry! He's in the living room!

01:35:20.172 --> 01:35:22.090
He went up the ladder!

01:35:39.483 --> 01:35:42.569
l'm coming, Harry. l'm coming.

01:35:47.992 --> 01:35:49.784
Harry! Harry!

01:35:51.245 --> 01:35:55.331
You didn't lose any teeth!
Come on, he went to the second floor.

01:35:55.791 --> 01:35:58.501
Hey! Why don't you guys try the stairs?

01:35:59.003 --> 01:36:00.462
Right.

01:36:03.007 --> 01:36:05.216
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

01:36:05.301 --> 01:36:08.261
Don't you remember
what happened last year?

01:36:08.345 --> 01:36:10.472
-No.
-Watch this.

01:36:11.849 --> 01:36:13.850
Let's get him!

01:36:18.814 --> 01:36:21.566
He busted me right in my mouth, Marv!

01:36:22.610 --> 01:36:24.110
That's one.

01:36:24.195 --> 01:36:28.114
Don't worry, Harry. l'll get him.

01:36:35.456 --> 01:36:37.540
Right in the schnoz.

01:36:38.626 --> 01:36:41.211
That's two. Come on, let's get him.

01:36:53.390 --> 01:36:55.725
That's three.

01:37:02.024 --> 01:37:03.107
No.

01:37:05.402 --> 01:37:06.986
That's four.

01:37:12.201 --> 01:37:14.786
-Come on, Harry.
-Marv, are you sure this is safe?

01:37:14.870 --> 01:37:20.208
Oh yeah. Yep, l've worked all the kinks out.
lt's solid as a rock.

01:37:37.685 --> 01:37:41.187
-Like a rock, huh, Marv?
-Hey? Do you guys give up?

01:37:41.272 --> 01:37:44.023
-Have you had enough pain?
-Never!

01:37:55.870 --> 01:37:58.621
You better say every prayer
you ever heard before, kid!

01:37:58.706 --> 01:38:02.292
l hope your parents got you
a tombstone for Christmas.

01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:08.047
-Where'd he go?
-l'm up here and l'm really scared.

01:38:18.183 --> 01:38:20.143
What's that sound?

01:38:40.080 --> 01:38:44.626
That was the sound of a tool chest
falling down the stairs.

01:38:51.467 --> 01:38:52.842
Yes!

01:39:27.711 --> 01:39:29.504
Over there!

01:39:29.588 --> 01:39:33.049
l don't care if l get the chair,
l'm killing that kid!

01:39:35.010 --> 01:39:36.970
Surrender, kid!

01:39:37.471 --> 01:39:40.765
-He vanished.
-l'm down here, you big horse's ass!

01:39:44.520 --> 01:39:47.146
-Whoa.
-Nice night for a neck injury!

01:39:48.649 --> 01:39:50.984
Suck brick, kid!

01:39:56.949 --> 01:39:59.784
-Come on, Marv.
-Oh, l don't know.

01:40:00.285 --> 01:40:02.245
l said, come on.

01:40:04.039 --> 01:40:06.416
Come on, you big sissy.

01:40:20.180 --> 01:40:23.016
Harry? You wearing aftershave?

01:40:23.100 --> 01:40:27.228
That's not aftershave. That's kerosene.
The rope is soaked in it.

01:40:28.188 --> 01:40:31.274
Now, why would anybody
soak a rope in kerosene?

01:40:35.612 --> 01:40:37.363
Merry Christmas.

01:40:38.073 --> 01:40:39.407
Go up!

01:41:14.359 --> 01:41:15.985
Get off me!

01:41:39.259 --> 01:41:40.802
Get the bag!

01:41:41.553 --> 01:41:44.680
Hello, the two guys who robbed
Duncan's Toy Chest are in the park.

01:41:44.765 --> 01:41:49.310
Central Park West, 95th Street.
Look for fireworks. Hurry, they got a gun.

01:41:56.110 --> 01:42:00.321
Hey, l'm down here. Better come
and get me before l call the cops.

01:42:15.462 --> 01:42:18.506
My, how the tables have turned.

01:42:18.590 --> 01:42:20.925
How do you like the ice, kid?

01:42:25.722 --> 01:42:28.516
Let's go for a little stroll in the park.

01:42:45.993 --> 01:42:48.327
Give me that bag. Give me it!

01:42:52.958 --> 01:42:55.918
Hey, these'll look great in the photo album.

01:42:56.670 --> 01:43:00.715
You may've won the battle, little dude,
but you lost the war.

01:43:01.258 --> 01:43:05.011
You ought not have messed with us, pal.
We're dangerous.

01:43:11.018 --> 01:43:13.060
-Harry?
-Shut up!

01:43:17.566 --> 01:43:21.235
-Harry.
-Shut up! l want to enjoy this.

01:43:21.862 --> 01:43:26.282
-Something's wrong. Let's get out of here!
-Shut up, l said!

01:43:28.535 --> 01:43:31.370
l never made it to the 6th grade, kid,

01:43:31.455 --> 01:43:34.957
and it doesn't look like
you're going to, either.

01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.251
Let him go!

01:43:37.336 --> 01:43:39.086
Kevin, run!

01:43:40.631 --> 01:43:44.759
Shoot her! Shoot her! Shoot her!

01:43:44.843 --> 01:43:47.136
l'm trying to shoot her!

01:44:02.736 --> 01:44:04.070
Run, Marv!

01:44:26.343 --> 01:44:28.261
Bye! Thanks.

01:44:53.996 --> 01:44:56.539
Jesus, looks like the 4th of July!

01:44:56.623 --> 01:44:58.207
-Okay, let's go.
-We'll take the bridge.

01:44:58.292 --> 01:45:01.377
You guys get the tunnel.
Let's go. Come on!

01:45:08.885 --> 01:45:10.720
Oh, my God!

01:45:21.064 --> 01:45:22.398
All right, guys, let's go, huh?

01:45:22.482 --> 01:45:25.735
-Come on, on your feet.
-Take it easy.

01:45:26.611 --> 01:45:27.653
What is this stuff?

01:45:29.072 --> 01:45:31.490
You guys should've started earlier.

01:45:31.575 --> 01:45:33.993
The prisoners have
already exchanged gifts.

01:45:34.077 --> 01:45:35.911
We missed the presents?

01:45:35.996 --> 01:45:39.749
He made us hide out in the store so we
could steal all the kiddies' charity money.

01:45:39.833 --> 01:45:42.168
Shut up, Marv.

01:45:43.086 --> 01:45:46.047
Got the right to remain silent, you know.

01:45:46.131 --> 01:45:49.050
He's a little cranky. We just broke out
of prison a few days ago.

01:45:49.134 --> 01:45:51.761
Shut up, Marv! Jeez.

01:45:52.179 --> 01:45:54.096
-Get them out of here!
-All right, let's go.

01:45:54.181 --> 01:45:55.765
Remember, if this makes the papers,

01:45:55.849 --> 01:45:58.601
we're no longer the Wet Bandits,
we're the Sticky Bandits.

01:45:58.685 --> 01:46:00.353
We're not Sticky Bandits, shut up!

01:46:00.437 --> 01:46:02.772
-That's Sticky. That's S...
-Shut it.

01:46:02.856 --> 01:46:04.315
...T...

01:46:04.775 --> 01:46:06.275
-l.
-...l...

01:46:18.622 --> 01:46:20.039
Well, Mr. Duncan, it's all over with.

01:46:20.123 --> 01:46:22.166
We apprehended the thieves
and we recovered your money.

01:46:22.250 --> 01:46:25.836
Good, l want to get that money over to the
Children's Hospital as soon as possible.

01:46:25.921 --> 01:46:29.382
-l'll handle it personally. My pleasure.
-Thank you very much.

01:46:29.466 --> 01:46:31.008
-Excuse me, Mr. Duncan.
-Yes.

01:46:31.093 --> 01:46:34.553
l found this note.
Looks like a kid broke your window.

01:46:51.488 --> 01:46:53.280
Turtledoves.

01:47:02.666 --> 01:47:06.460
Excuse me. l'm looking for my son.
He's this boy right here.

01:47:08.422 --> 01:47:10.589
Excuse me. Please help me.
This boy right here. Have you seen him?

01:47:10.674 --> 01:47:12.967
This one, he's... Please.

01:47:21.393 --> 01:47:23.269
l'm looking for my son.
Have you seen my son? He's...

01:47:23.353 --> 01:47:25.104
There. He's been missing for two days.

01:47:25.188 --> 01:47:29.108
-Well, have you filed a report, ma'am?
-Yes, of course we have.

01:47:30.068 --> 01:47:32.611
Then trust us. We'll handle it.

01:47:37.701 --> 01:47:39.535
But l'm his mother.

01:47:40.412 --> 01:47:44.540
l realize that, ma'am, but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

01:47:44.624 --> 01:47:48.043
-Do you have kids?
-Yes, ma'am.

01:47:48.128 --> 01:47:51.380
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?

01:47:52.382 --> 01:47:55.718
l'd probably be doing the same thing
you're doing.

01:47:56.261 --> 01:47:57.761
Thank you.

01:48:00.223 --> 01:48:04.393
Look, put yourself in your kid's shoes.
Where would you go? What would you do?

01:48:04.478 --> 01:48:08.063
Me? l'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

01:48:09.441 --> 01:48:14.153
Oh, but not Kevin. No. Kevin is
so much stronger and braver than l am.

01:48:15.655 --> 01:48:18.532
l know Kevin's fine. l'm sure he is. Fine.

01:48:19.826 --> 01:48:24.747
But he's still all by himself in a big city.
And he doesn't deserve that.

01:48:25.415 --> 01:48:29.919
He deserves to be at home with
his own family around his Christmas tree.

01:48:33.423 --> 01:48:36.759
Oh, dear God, l know where he is.

01:48:38.220 --> 01:48:40.763
l need to get to Rockefeller Center.

01:48:40.847 --> 01:48:43.015
-Hop in.
-Thank you.

01:48:47.437 --> 01:48:51.690
l know l don't deserve a Christmas
even if l did do a good deed.

01:48:52.609 --> 01:48:54.360
l don't want any presents.

01:48:54.444 --> 01:48:58.697
lnstead, l want to take back
every mean thing l ever said to my family,

01:48:58.782 --> 01:49:01.534
even if they don't take back
the things that they said.

01:49:01.618 --> 01:49:05.454
l don't care. l love all of them.
lncluding Buzz.

01:49:06.581 --> 01:49:10.626
lf it isn't possible l can see all of them,
could l just see my mother?

01:49:10.710 --> 01:49:15.381
l'll never want another thing
as long as l live. l just want my mother.

01:49:15.465 --> 01:49:19.426
l know l won't see her tonight,
but promise me l can see her again.

01:49:19.511 --> 01:49:21.470
Sometime. Anytime.

01:49:22.264 --> 01:49:25.849
Even if it's just once
and only for a couple of minutes.

01:49:25.934 --> 01:49:28.852
l just need to tell her l'm sorry.

01:49:36.570 --> 01:49:38.362
Kevin?

01:49:44.077 --> 01:49:45.494
Mom?

01:49:47.664 --> 01:49:49.999
Wow! That worked fast!

01:50:00.343 --> 01:50:02.011
Oh, Kevin.

01:50:03.430 --> 01:50:05.180
Mom, l'm sorry.

01:50:06.933 --> 01:50:09.018
l'm sorry, too.

01:50:21.156 --> 01:50:23.240
Merry Christmas, Mom.

01:50:25.160 --> 01:50:27.328
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

01:50:28.705 --> 01:50:31.373
Thank you. Let's go.

01:50:32.876 --> 01:50:34.293
How'd you know l was here?

01:50:34.377 --> 01:50:37.254
Well, l know you and Christmas trees,
and this is the biggest one around.

01:50:37.339 --> 01:50:39.632
-Where's everybody else?
-They're at the hotel.

01:50:39.716 --> 01:50:42.217
They didn't like palm trees either.

01:51:26.012 --> 01:51:28.472
Holy smokes, it's morning!

01:51:29.766 --> 01:51:31.975
lt's Christmas morning, man.

01:51:33.353 --> 01:51:35.813
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

01:51:36.815 --> 01:51:39.024
l don't think Santa Claus visits hotels.

01:51:39.109 --> 01:51:42.695
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.
He goes everywhere.

01:51:44.823 --> 01:51:47.491
Hey, guys, wake up, it's Christmas!

01:51:51.162 --> 01:51:53.330
-Mom! Dad! lt's Christmas!
-What?

01:52:05.969 --> 01:52:07.469
-Wow
-Wow

01:52:07.929 --> 01:52:11.932
-Where'd it all come from?
-Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

01:52:15.895 --> 01:52:17.896
-My gosh!
-Peter!

01:52:17.981 --> 01:52:20.649
Are you sure we're in the right room?

01:52:25.530 --> 01:52:27.448
Don't open any of mine. l mean it.

01:52:27.532 --> 01:52:30.826
-Who's Mr. Duncan?
-Duncan? l don't know.

01:52:30.910 --> 01:52:34.580
All right, everyone, just calm down.
Calm down! Hey! Hey!

01:52:35.373 --> 01:52:40.627
All right. Now, if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place, again,

01:52:41.838 --> 01:52:45.674
then we wouldn't be in this
most perfect and huge hotel room

01:52:45.759 --> 01:52:48.177
with a truckload of all this free stuff.

01:52:48.261 --> 01:52:52.723
So, l think it only fair that Kevin
get to open up the first present.

01:52:54.184 --> 01:52:57.352
Then l'll go and the rest of you and so on.

01:53:01.483 --> 01:53:05.194
-Merry Christmas, Kev.
-Merry Christmas, Buzz.

01:53:07.989 --> 01:53:13.660
-Merry Christmas, Kevin.
-Okay, Kevin! All right! Merry Christmas!

01:53:15.371 --> 01:53:20.167
Enough of this gooey... Show of emotion.
Everyone, let's dig in!

01:53:20.251 --> 01:53:22.127
All right!

01:53:22.212 --> 01:53:25.464
Everybody, now, wait, save the paper.
We can use it next year. And the bows.

01:53:25.548 --> 01:53:27.382
Give me the bows...

01:54:02.919 --> 01:54:04.628
Merry Christmas.

01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:09.424
Kevin! Merry Christmas!

01:54:10.760 --> 01:54:13.011
l got something for you.

01:54:20.478 --> 01:54:24.857
-What's this?
-lt's a turtledove. l have one. You have one.

01:54:24.941 --> 01:54:28.986
As long as we each have a turtledove,
we'll be friends forever.

01:54:32.949 --> 01:54:34.992
Oh, Kevin.

01:54:38.162 --> 01:54:39.913
Thank you.

01:54:41.249 --> 01:54:43.625
l won't forget you. Trust me.

01:55:11.821 --> 01:55:14.823
Mr. McCallister's room service bill, sir.

01:55:16.159 --> 01:55:18.160
Merry Christmas, sir.

01:55:24.250 --> 01:55:26.293
Nice family. Really.

01:55:36.304 --> 01:55:38.347
Merry Christmas indeed.

01:55:39.307 --> 01:55:40.974
Oh, Dad!

01:55:41.559 --> 01:55:46.104
Kevin! You spent $967 on room service?

01:59:59.233 --> 02:00:00.000
English - US
