00:01.335 --> 00:04.238
Previously on
Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:04.238 --> 00:06.407
I am your new pastor,
Joseph Falade.

00:06.407 --> 00:08.776
And I wanted
to sit with you to show you

00:08.776 --> 00:10.178
that I am not a prophet.

00:10.178 --> 00:12.180
I am just a man.

00:12.180 --> 00:14.548
A man with a theology degree
from Harvard

00:14.548 --> 00:16.850
and this wonderful
handmade suit.

00:17.551 --> 00:19.720
It seems the pastor
has taken a liking

00:19.720 --> 00:23.191
to a certain married member
of his flock.

00:23.191 --> 00:24.225
Who?

00:24.225 --> 00:26.794
Mummy, is that a new dress?

00:26.794 --> 00:28.162
It is.

00:28.162 --> 00:30.164
I like to look my best...

00:30.164 --> 00:32.400
for God.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.570
We're all set.

00:36.570 --> 00:38.772
The rest of the team's
ready to meet you.

00:38.772 --> 00:40.841
I appreciate you getting me
this interview.

00:40.841 --> 00:43.977
Oh, are you kidding?
They are gonna love you.

00:43.977 --> 00:45.979
This is the right move, Goodwin.

00:45.979 --> 00:47.615
Yes, it is.

00:49.817 --> 00:51.852
(laughing)

00:52.986 --> 00:55.989
I have never heard your
mother giggle before.

00:55.989 --> 00:57.258
Me, neither.

00:57.258 --> 00:59.059
I was 15 the first time

00:59.059 --> 01:00.628
I saw her smile with teeth.

01:00.628 --> 01:03.897
And now the pastor
has probably seen

01:03.897 --> 01:05.933
every molar in her mouth.

01:05.933 --> 01:08.035
Can you blame her?
He's a charming guy.

01:08.035 --> 01:10.638
Every time he talked, I felt
like he was looking right at me.

01:10.638 --> 01:12.873
I also felt like his
eyes were following me.

01:12.873 --> 01:14.308
Like the Mona Lisa.

01:14.308 --> 01:16.744
Or those cat clocks.

01:16.744 --> 01:18.612
Your mother is drooling
over the pastor

01:18.612 --> 01:20.381
like a plate
of chin chin.

01:20.381 --> 01:21.749
If this gets out,

01:21.749 --> 01:23.551
we will be forced
to find a new church.

01:23.551 --> 01:26.320
I should've known something was
up when Ebun showed cleavage.

01:26.320 --> 01:28.389
That is my thing.

01:28.389 --> 01:30.258
It is our thing.

01:30.258 --> 01:33.026
(both laugh)

01:33.026 --> 01:35.163
You giggle
like your sister.

01:35.163 --> 01:37.398
Hello, Ogechi.

01:37.398 --> 01:39.433
The pastor
and a married woman.

01:39.433 --> 01:41.502
What will people say?

01:41.502 --> 01:44.372
Perhaps we should keep
this to ourselves.

01:44.372 --> 01:46.039
Perhaps.

01:46.039 --> 01:48.542
Or perhaps not.

01:50.544 --> 01:52.746
("Ifanla" by Sola Akingbola
playing)

02:16.770 --> 02:19.473
E kaale, Mumm.
Kaale.

02:19.473 --> 02:20.508
You are going out?

02:20.508 --> 02:21.542
Yes.

02:21.542 --> 02:23.010
Bible study.

02:23.010 --> 02:24.478
You are taking wine?

02:25.479 --> 02:27.815
It is the blood of Christ.

02:27.815 --> 02:30.584
His blood is a sparkling rosÃ©?

02:30.584 --> 02:32.853
Why are you questioning me?

02:32.853 --> 02:34.555
I am just worried, Mummy.

02:34.555 --> 02:35.923
Worried about what?

02:35.923 --> 02:38.792
You are a married woman.
People are talking.

02:38.792 --> 02:41.595
Are you one of these
"talking" people?

02:41.595 --> 02:42.596
Of course not.

02:42.596 --> 02:43.897
Good.

02:43.897 --> 02:45.566
Because it is none
of your business.

02:47.401 --> 02:49.437
(sighs)

02:50.538 --> 02:52.506
E kaale, Mummy.
Granny.

02:52.506 --> 02:53.607
Where have you been?

02:53.607 --> 02:55.175
I was studying at Jason's house.

02:55.175 --> 02:58.212
What do you even know
about this Jason?

02:58.979 --> 03:00.814
We're in class together.

03:00.814 --> 03:03.584
And his mom's a dentist.

03:03.584 --> 03:06.654
You cannot just rush
into studying with somebody.

03:06.654 --> 03:09.022
Have you even thought
about your old study partner

03:09.022 --> 03:10.991
and how he would feel

03:10.991 --> 03:13.394
if he knew you were
studying with Jason?

03:14.362 --> 03:15.796
No.

03:15.796 --> 03:18.966
Exactly.
You cannot just go out all night

03:18.966 --> 03:23.003
studying and carrying on.

03:23.771 --> 03:25.906
It's 5:30.

03:25.906 --> 03:27.741
How dare you talk back to me.

03:27.741 --> 03:29.142
Go to your room.

03:29.142 --> 03:30.744
And think about
what you are doing

03:30.744 --> 03:32.446
to this family.

03:32.446 --> 03:34.248
Yes, Mum.

03:35.182 --> 03:37.751
You let that boy get away
with far too much.

03:45.326 --> 03:47.160
Where do you go to church?

03:47.160 --> 03:49.263
First Lutheran.
Every Sunday.

03:49.263 --> 03:50.564
Do you enjoy the services?

03:50.564 --> 03:54.034
Oh, yes, the best
four hours of my week.

03:54.034 --> 03:55.769
Four hours?

03:55.769 --> 03:58.005
I'll take my chances in hell.

03:58.005 --> 04:00.073
I need your signature
for payroll.

04:00.073 --> 04:02.042
I hope you remembered
to pay yourself.

04:02.042 --> 04:04.745
Amusing every time.

04:05.446 --> 04:07.915
And one more for your records.
What's this?

04:07.915 --> 04:09.249
My resignation.

04:09.249 --> 04:10.784
Thank you
for the last 30 years.

04:10.784 --> 04:12.586
(laughs)

04:12.586 --> 04:14.322
Wait, you're serious?

04:14.322 --> 04:16.590
Yes, Mr. Wheeler.
I wish you continued success.

04:16.590 --> 04:18.191
No, huh-uh, no.

04:18.191 --> 04:20.994
I have thought about this
decision for quite some time,

04:20.994 --> 04:23.364
and it is not one
I take lightly.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.032
Please, Goodwin, don't do this.

04:25.032 --> 04:28.135
Mr. Wheeler, do not make
this harder than it is.

04:28.135 --> 04:31.004
You can't go. We're a team.
Like Lennon and McCartney,

04:31.004 --> 04:32.373
Hall and Oates, Wheeler and...

04:32.373 --> 04:33.974
How do you say your last name?

04:33.974 --> 04:34.975
Olayiwola.

04:34.975 --> 04:36.610
Yeah, that.

04:36.610 --> 04:37.945
Goodbye, Mr. Wheeler.

04:37.945 --> 04:39.880
Aw, just sit down,
let's talk about this.

04:39.880 --> 04:41.482
It is too late.

04:41.482 --> 04:44.585
I have already accepted
another job at Toesey Woesies.

04:44.585 --> 04:46.454
My sister stole you?

04:46.454 --> 04:48.922
If you call offering me
a higher-paying job

04:48.922 --> 04:52.292
with better prospects stealing,
then yes.

04:52.292 --> 04:54.462
How could you do this to me?
Sir...

04:54.462 --> 04:57.164
as long as you are here,
I can never be promoted.

04:57.164 --> 04:58.599
I knew I had to leave

04:58.599 --> 05:00.734
when I found myself
wishing for your death.

05:00.734 --> 05:04.037
That's okay. I wish
for my death all the time.

05:04.037 --> 05:05.906
I am sorry, Mr. Wheeler.

05:05.906 --> 05:07.841
Oh, don't be sorry,
just stay.

05:07.841 --> 05:09.109
Wheeler and Olayiwola.

05:09.109 --> 05:11.579
See, I said it. I can change!

05:19.987 --> 05:21.922
The tea is delicious, thank you.

05:21.922 --> 05:23.524
Y-You are welcome.

05:24.692 --> 05:26.460
What is it, oolong?

05:26.460 --> 05:27.528
Yes.

05:27.528 --> 05:29.029
It is funny.

05:29.029 --> 05:30.898
I prefer a breakfast tea.

05:30.898 --> 05:32.165
Even at dinnertime.

05:32.165 --> 05:35.068
Oh, just get on with it, Ogechi!

05:35.068 --> 05:37.538
I would rather
take things slow.

05:37.538 --> 05:40.541
Unlike your
loose-moraled sister.

05:40.541 --> 05:42.510
I do not know
what you are talking about.

05:42.510 --> 05:45.045
Ebun is a respectable,
pious woman.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.214
Oh, yes, I have no doubt
she has been touched

05:47.214 --> 05:49.483
by a holy hand.

05:49.483 --> 05:51.752
What is it you want, Ogechi?

05:51.752 --> 05:55.222
I want to help you keep this
from becoming a scandal.

05:55.222 --> 05:57.257
You are the only
other person who knows.

05:57.257 --> 05:59.793
So just don't tell anyone.

05:59.793 --> 06:02.262
That is not going to happen.

06:02.996 --> 06:04.798
Unless...

06:04.798 --> 06:06.600
Unless?

06:06.600 --> 06:10.037
I have always wanted
to run the potluck.

06:10.037 --> 06:11.539
Olu runs the potluck.

06:11.539 --> 06:14.475
I have always wanted
to run the potluck.

06:14.475 --> 06:16.977
Done.
And I want my son,

06:16.977 --> 06:19.212
Chukwuemeka,
on the deacon board.

06:19.212 --> 06:22.015
But he is just a boy!
Tunde.

06:22.015 --> 06:24.084
Do not fight her.
It's all right.

06:24.084 --> 06:26.987
I like knowing it upsets him.

06:26.987 --> 06:28.922
(sighs)
Fine.

06:28.922 --> 06:30.524
I will put him
on the deacon board.

06:30.524 --> 06:33.226
And let that be the end of it.

06:33.226 --> 06:35.996
Of course,
thank you.

06:35.996 --> 06:39.199
Now, let's talk
Christmas seating.

06:40.133 --> 06:43.103
Great, yes.
That's the new campaign.

06:43.103 --> 06:44.905
With every pair of socks
we sell,

06:44.905 --> 06:47.975
Toesey Woesies will donate
a pair to a homeless person.

06:47.975 --> 06:49.610
So we get a tax break

06:49.610 --> 06:53.080
and free advertising
whenever people drive

06:53.080 --> 06:55.248
through an underpass.

06:55.248 --> 06:57.384
Call you back.

06:57.384 --> 06:59.887
Hey, big brother,
what's up?

06:59.887 --> 07:02.055
Ah, you remember
we're related.

07:02.055 --> 07:03.891
That's encouraging.
Okay, look.

07:03.891 --> 07:05.459
Before you say anything,

07:05.459 --> 07:07.528
you need to know,
Goodwin came to me.

07:07.528 --> 07:09.096
And you didn't come to me.

07:09.096 --> 07:11.298
Mm... no.

07:11.298 --> 07:13.667
What the hell?
I've always supported you.

07:13.667 --> 07:15.769
Even when you went
to work for a competitor.

07:15.769 --> 07:18.872
I know.
Mom wanted to have you
institutionalized.

07:18.872 --> 07:20.841
Bob, this isn't personal.

07:20.841 --> 07:23.443
A talented executive asked
to join my company.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.713
It'd be bad business
to turn him away.

07:25.713 --> 07:27.414
Oh, so this is
just business to you?

07:27.414 --> 07:29.416
Our family means nothing.

07:30.518 --> 07:33.286
Can I tell you a secret?
Yeah.

07:33.286 --> 07:36.924
Less than nothing.

07:37.691 --> 07:39.326
What happened to you?
What happened

07:39.326 --> 07:41.629
to the sweet little girl
I used to take for ice cream?

07:41.629 --> 07:43.897
Oh, she gets
her own ice cream now,

07:43.897 --> 07:45.933
'cause she's the boss bitch.

07:46.934 --> 07:48.502
Oh, you know who you sound like?

07:48.502 --> 07:51.605
The boss bitch?
No.

07:51.605 --> 07:55.876
The boss bitch
from whence we came.

07:55.876 --> 07:58.245
Don't you dare.

07:58.245 --> 08:01.615
Oh, yeah, it's like I'm looking
at you, but I'm talking to Mom.

08:01.615 --> 08:04.451
You shut up.
I'm not anything like her!

08:04.451 --> 08:05.953
Listen to yourself.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.454
Get out of here, Bobby!

08:07.454 --> 08:09.923
Oh, my God. Get out!

08:09.923 --> 08:11.058
Bye, Mom.

08:11.058 --> 08:13.293
(exhales)

08:16.396 --> 08:18.966
What have I become?

08:22.570 --> 08:24.972
I could book my mother
a Caribbean cruise.

08:24.972 --> 08:27.641
She'd be away from the pastor
for two weeks.

08:27.641 --> 08:29.509
So she can meet
another lover?

08:29.509 --> 08:32.079
You know what women of her
age do in the Caribbean.

08:32.079 --> 08:34.414
They get their groove back.

08:34.414 --> 08:37.217
I say let
your mom have some fun.

08:37.217 --> 08:38.586
Sounds like a harmless flirt.

08:38.586 --> 08:40.621
"Harmless" would have
been getting herself

08:40.621 --> 08:42.522
somebody from outside
of the church.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.325
Do not poop where you pray.

08:45.325 --> 08:46.794
She's a married woman.

08:46.794 --> 08:48.729
She should not
be pooping at all.

08:48.729 --> 08:51.832
You said it was
a loveless marriage.
Yes.

08:51.832 --> 08:53.834
That's why I told her
she could stay in America.

08:53.834 --> 08:56.236
So you just wanted her
to sit in your guest room

08:56.236 --> 08:58.071
alone and miserable forever?

08:58.071 --> 09:01.374
No, I was hoping eventually she
would get a place of her own.

09:01.374 --> 09:03.744
Ladies, please.

09:03.744 --> 09:06.046
We all agree this is
Abishola's fault.

09:06.046 --> 09:08.148
Huh?
But the question is,

09:08.148 --> 09:10.450
what are we going
to do about it?

09:10.450 --> 09:12.352
You could let her be happy.

09:12.352 --> 09:14.354
Or... we could

09:14.354 --> 09:16.790
burn their forbidden love
to the ground.

09:17.490 --> 09:19.793
I like Kemi's idea.

09:19.793 --> 09:22.730
If we cannot keep your mother
away from the pastor,

09:22.730 --> 09:26.333
we will take the pastor
away from her.

09:26.333 --> 09:29.336
How?
Hmm. Leave that to me.

09:29.336 --> 09:32.005
All right, that's my cue.
Where are you going?

09:32.005 --> 09:34.474
I don't want to have
to testify against you.

09:41.815 --> 09:43.984
(sighs)

09:43.984 --> 09:46.086
Don't set a place
for my mom.

09:46.086 --> 09:48.188
She's still at the office
looking for a way

09:48.188 --> 09:50.123
to screw Goodwin out
of his last paycheck.

09:50.123 --> 09:53.126
Oh, she is
so dedicated.

09:53.126 --> 09:55.663
Did she drink
all the wine, too?

09:55.663 --> 09:57.330
That was my mother.

09:57.330 --> 09:59.867
Apparently, she and the pastor
get very...

09:59.867 --> 10:02.435
thirsty during bible study.

10:02.435 --> 10:05.773
Well, at least your
mom's capable of love.

10:05.773 --> 10:08.208
You say that
like it's a good thing.

10:09.843 --> 10:12.045
Let me ask you something.

10:12.045 --> 10:13.747
Do you think
I'm an honest guy?

10:13.747 --> 10:15.082
Do you trust me?

10:15.082 --> 10:17.885
What have you done?

10:18.852 --> 10:21.621
I promised Goodwin my job
to keep him working at MaxDot,

10:21.621 --> 10:25.092
but deep down I don't think
I ever intended to quit.

10:25.092 --> 10:27.027
What is wrong with that?

10:27.027 --> 10:28.862
It's dishonest.

10:28.862 --> 10:30.731
Sounds like good business.

10:30.731 --> 10:32.365
You motivated a worker.

10:32.365 --> 10:34.835
He's not just a worker--
he's my friend.

10:34.835 --> 10:37.270
Some friend you are.
You lied to him.

10:38.038 --> 10:40.273
I didn't mean to.

10:40.273 --> 10:41.675
I know.

10:41.675 --> 10:45.245
I guess I'm just afraid that
if I'm not running things

10:45.245 --> 10:47.647
then, you know,
what-what good am I?

10:48.581 --> 10:51.151
That is a fair question.

10:56.256 --> 10:59.192
Okay, before we get in there,
let me hear it again.

10:59.192 --> 11:03.396
I am so happy that you and
my mother have found each other.

11:03.396 --> 11:05.933
That is terrible. I don't
believe a word of that.

11:05.933 --> 11:07.200
Because it is not true.

11:07.200 --> 11:09.336
I don't want the pastor
dating my mother.

11:09.336 --> 11:11.705
He needs to feel
we are on his side

11:11.705 --> 11:12.973
so he lets his guard down.

11:12.973 --> 11:15.242
Then I will seduce
him and prove

11:15.242 --> 11:16.944
that he's just
another dirty dog.

11:16.944 --> 11:18.245
How?
(scoffs)

11:19.112 --> 11:21.749
By offering him
these fresh biscuits.

11:22.682 --> 11:23.683
FALADE:
Come in.

11:23.683 --> 11:25.218
Those are fresh?

11:27.187 --> 11:29.656
Ah. Hello,
Kemi, Abishola.

11:29.656 --> 11:30.724
Hello, Pastor.

11:30.724 --> 11:33.660
Can we... speak to you?

11:33.660 --> 11:35.462
(door closes)
Of course.

11:35.462 --> 11:36.529
Sit down.

11:37.564 --> 11:40.033
(exhales, grunts)

11:40.033 --> 11:41.935
What can I do for you?

11:41.935 --> 11:44.872
Well, Abishola has
something to say.

11:44.872 --> 11:46.039
How could you,

11:46.039 --> 11:47.240
a man of God,

11:47.240 --> 11:48.876
be carrying on
with a married woman?

11:48.876 --> 11:50.010
(exhales)

11:50.010 --> 11:52.813
She's also very
happy for you.

11:52.813 --> 11:54.314
I understand
your concern,

11:54.314 --> 11:57.150
but, I assure you, nothing
inappropriate has occurred.

11:57.150 --> 11:58.886
You spend
the whole church service

11:58.886 --> 12:00.120
making eyes at my mother.

12:00.120 --> 12:01.688
(sighs)
I cannot deny

12:01.688 --> 12:03.590
that I have feelings for Ebun.

12:03.590 --> 12:04.591
KEMI:
And why deny

12:04.591 --> 12:05.859
your feelings?

12:05.859 --> 12:08.161
If you see something you want...

12:08.161 --> 12:10.630
(whispers):
you take it.

12:11.631 --> 12:12.699
Abishola,

12:12.699 --> 12:14.267
I am sorry.

12:14.267 --> 12:17.104
I never expected this to happen.

12:17.104 --> 12:18.738
But your
mother is...

12:18.738 --> 12:20.573
(chuckles)
a remarkable woman.

12:20.573 --> 12:23.210
Smart, funny, kind.

12:25.645 --> 12:26.713
My mother?

12:27.480 --> 12:29.850
Ebunoluwa
Adebisi Odegbami?

12:29.850 --> 12:32.652
I-I was hoping, on some level,

12:32.652 --> 12:35.856
that you, of all people,
might understand.

12:35.856 --> 12:37.590
What is that
supposed to mean?

12:37.590 --> 12:40.928
(sighs) You also were in
an unhappy marriage

12:40.928 --> 12:42.863
and fell in love with another.

12:42.863 --> 12:44.397
What do you know about it?

12:44.397 --> 12:47.334
Your mother told me
all about you and Bob.

12:48.568 --> 12:50.070
You have never been afraid
to take risks

12:50.070 --> 12:52.372
in order to be happy.

12:53.073 --> 12:54.875
She admires your courage.

12:54.875 --> 12:56.343
Really?

12:56.343 --> 12:59.146
(chuckles) She may not speak
those words to you,

12:59.146 --> 13:02.115
but, believe me,
they are in her heart.

13:02.115 --> 13:03.851
KEMI:
Yes.

13:03.851 --> 13:05.853
The big, beating,

13:05.853 --> 13:07.654
bouncy heart.

13:09.589 --> 13:10.590
Anything?

13:10.590 --> 13:12.625
No?

13:12.625 --> 13:13.693
Okay, we are leaving.

13:20.868 --> 13:21.869
Goodwin.

13:21.869 --> 13:22.802
Yes, my dear.

13:22.802 --> 13:24.337
Mr. Wheeler is here.

13:24.337 --> 13:25.505
Hi!

13:26.406 --> 13:27.908
Mr. Wheeler,
what are you doing here?

13:27.908 --> 13:29.309
I just wanted
to talk.

13:29.309 --> 13:31.644
You know I've never been
to your house before?

13:31.644 --> 13:33.680
Yes, we are aware.

13:35.782 --> 13:37.317
Please, come in.

13:38.151 --> 13:39.719
Nice space here.

13:39.719 --> 13:40.820
Thank you.

13:41.821 --> 13:43.623
From Lagos with Love

13:43.623 --> 13:44.691
by Goodwin O.?

13:44.691 --> 13:46.259
It is a fast-paced thriller

13:46.259 --> 13:48.795
about a man who works
in a sock factory by day

13:48.795 --> 13:50.530
and fights injustice by night.

13:50.530 --> 13:53.066
"All while learning to love."

13:53.066 --> 13:55.635
I didn't know you were
an aspiring author.

13:55.635 --> 13:57.804
Oh, there is much you do not
know about me, Mr. Wheeler.

13:57.804 --> 13:59.172
Mm.
I am also

13:59.172 --> 14:00.307
a notary public

14:00.307 --> 14:02.342
and a beekeeper.
No kidding.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.277
I will give you some honey
on your way out.

14:04.277 --> 14:07.280
Thanks. Listen,
I-I just stopped by to say...

14:07.280 --> 14:09.482
I know why you quit.

14:09.482 --> 14:10.483
I get it.

14:10.483 --> 14:11.351
You do?

14:11.351 --> 14:12.819
I was never gonna leave.

14:12.819 --> 14:15.355
I was lying to myself
and I was lying to you.

14:15.355 --> 14:17.124
Yes. You were being...

14:17.124 --> 14:18.725
(speaks foreign language)

14:18.725 --> 14:21.962
What's that?
I believe the English
translation is

14:21.962 --> 14:24.631
"liar, liar, pants on fire."

14:25.765 --> 14:27.700
I just want you to know
that I wish you the best

14:27.700 --> 14:30.003
and I hope we can stay friends.
(sighs)

14:30.003 --> 14:31.338
I hope so, too.

14:31.338 --> 14:33.706
It is unlikely,
but I still hope.

14:33.706 --> 14:34.874
(chuckles)
Come here.

14:37.144 --> 14:38.811
You're gonna do great
at that new job.

14:38.811 --> 14:40.113
I know.

14:40.113 --> 14:42.049
And you are going to
be lost without me.

14:42.049 --> 14:43.716
I know.

14:43.716 --> 14:46.486
Maybe you can promote
your brother, Douglas.

14:47.820 --> 14:49.889
Just give me some honey
and I'll get out of here.

14:53.293 --> 14:55.295
Have a teaspoon
every morning

14:55.295 --> 14:56.729
and your colon will thank you.

14:56.729 --> 14:58.765
(footsteps approaching)
TIWA:
Goodwin,

14:58.765 --> 15:00.900
will you and Mr. Wheeler
be needing some refreshments?

15:00.900 --> 15:02.102
Oh, no, I was just leaving.

15:02.102 --> 15:03.770
Good.

15:07.975 --> 15:09.676
Oh.
(chuckles)

15:09.676 --> 15:11.711
(chuckling)

15:11.711 --> 15:13.947
He really does
seem to like her.

15:13.947 --> 15:15.482
Mm-hmm.

15:15.482 --> 15:17.650
Maybe this is a good thing
for the both of them.

15:17.650 --> 15:20.954
Maybe. But I'm still going
to try and seduce him.

15:20.954 --> 15:22.322
What? N-No.

15:22.322 --> 15:23.856
I don't need you
to do that anymore.

15:23.856 --> 15:25.192
Oh, it's not for you.

15:25.192 --> 15:26.726
It's for me.

15:27.660 --> 15:29.362
Hello, Pastor!

15:31.598 --> 15:32.832
Oh, thank you.

15:34.134 --> 15:37.204
Look at her, putting cookies
next to the meat.

15:37.204 --> 15:39.339
(clicks tongue)
This is chaos.

15:39.339 --> 15:40.673
That would have never happened

15:40.673 --> 15:42.775
when you were
refreshment coordinator.

15:42.775 --> 15:44.211
She's a terrible woman,

15:44.211 --> 15:45.912
blackmailing us like that.

15:45.912 --> 15:48.248
She is despicable.

15:48.248 --> 15:49.482
Tunde.

15:49.482 --> 15:50.750
Olu.

15:50.750 --> 15:53.253
Ogechi.
Ogechi.

15:53.253 --> 15:55.755
Tunde, now that my son
is on the deacon board,

15:55.755 --> 15:59.226
it looks like there are enough
votes to make you head deacon.

15:59.226 --> 16:00.160
Me?

16:00.160 --> 16:01.961
If you are interested.

16:01.961 --> 16:03.930
(chuckling)
Boy, yes!

16:03.930 --> 16:06.699
Come, let's walk
and discuss.

16:07.434 --> 16:08.701
Ah! What are you doing?

16:08.701 --> 16:10.303
I'm making a deal
with the devil.

16:10.303 --> 16:11.571
I'll see you at home.

16:13.940 --> 16:16.009
(indistinct chatter)

16:40.800 --> 16:42.702
I'm just gonna say it.

16:42.702 --> 16:44.937
It's weird without Goodwin here.

16:44.937 --> 16:47.074
I had breakfast with him
this morning.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.808
I cannot believe
it will be eight hours

16:48.808 --> 16:50.843
until I see him again.

16:50.843 --> 16:53.646
Did you guys know
he was a beekeeper?

16:53.646 --> 16:54.981
Of course.
Sure.
Of course.

16:54.981 --> 16:57.217
I sell his honey
at the farmers market.

16:57.217 --> 16:59.486
At least I'll see him
on Saturday.

17:00.220 --> 17:02.289
I didn't deserve him.

17:02.289 --> 17:03.756
All right,
quit your crying.

17:03.756 --> 17:05.125
We got work to do.

17:05.125 --> 17:06.726
Speaking of which,

17:06.726 --> 17:09.862
thought about promoting someone
to fill the vacancy?

17:09.862 --> 17:11.198
No.

17:11.198 --> 17:13.066
DOTTIE:
We don't need anybody else.

17:13.066 --> 17:15.034
We got Bob.
He'll pick up the slack,

17:15.034 --> 17:16.369
like he always does.

17:16.369 --> 17:18.004
We believe in you, Mr. Wheeler.

17:18.004 --> 17:19.038
Of course you do.

17:19.038 --> 17:20.907
He's never let us down.

17:20.907 --> 17:23.110
When his father, Max, died,

17:23.110 --> 17:25.612
he quit school and
swooped in to save us.

17:25.612 --> 17:26.979
Isn't that right, honey?

17:26.979 --> 17:28.515
I gave up my dream
of being a sportscaster

17:28.515 --> 17:29.649
to come here.

17:29.649 --> 17:30.817
And when your first marriage
was falling apart,

17:30.817 --> 17:32.085
where were you?

17:33.320 --> 17:34.287
Here.

17:34.287 --> 17:36.055
And four days
after your heart attack,

17:36.055 --> 17:37.824
which this job gave you,

17:37.824 --> 17:39.392
where were you?

17:40.227 --> 17:41.994
Right back here,
working up another one.

17:41.994 --> 17:43.029
Exactly.

17:43.029 --> 17:44.697
My Bobby doesn't need friends.

17:44.697 --> 17:46.032
He doesn't need hobbies.

17:46.032 --> 17:47.434
He's got MaxDot.

17:47.434 --> 17:50.570
The whole country could
be hit by an atomic bomb

17:50.570 --> 17:53.306
and our little cockroach would
still be here selling socks.

17:53.306 --> 17:54.774
Hey, Bobby,
where you going?

17:55.708 --> 17:58.111
Bob? Bobby!

18:00.012 --> 18:03.116
If he's gonna leave,
maybe I should run the meeting.

18:03.883 --> 18:05.252
No.

18:06.085 --> 18:09.256
* Don't stop talking
'bout freedom *

18:09.256 --> 18:11.424
* Get going,
lots to be learned *

18:11.424 --> 18:13.260
* And lots to be knowing
'bout people *

18:13.260 --> 18:15.762
(phone rings)
* Got to reach 'em

18:15.762 --> 18:17.797
Yes?
DOTTIE:
Where did you go?

18:17.797 --> 18:19.299
Out.

18:19.299 --> 18:21.401
We're in the middle
of a meeting.
I know.

18:21.401 --> 18:23.570
You can't just leave
in the middle of a meeting.

18:23.570 --> 18:24.937
I know.

18:24.937 --> 18:27.006
Well, get back here!

18:27.006 --> 18:29.809
No. I don't think I will.

18:29.809 --> 18:31.311
What do you mean?

18:31.311 --> 18:33.112
What the hell is going on?!

18:33.112 --> 18:35.148
* Go away

18:35.148 --> 18:42.289
* 'Cause freedom

18:42.289 --> 18:47.560
* Just might come your way.
