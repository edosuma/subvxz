00:01.284 --> 00:02.718
<i>* Men. *</i>

00:02.718 --> 00:05.751
* Oh, the weather outside
is frightful *

00:05.751 --> 00:08.384
* But the fire is
so delightful *

00:08.384 --> 00:11.917
* And since we've
no place to go *

00:11.917 --> 00:15.217
* Let it snow, let it
snow, let it snow. *

00:16.184 --> 00:18.184
Snow, sleet, rain, sun,

00:18.184 --> 00:21.417
you've still got
no place to go.

00:21.417 --> 00:24.050
(in Dickensian accent):
Which is why I'm grateful

00:24.050 --> 00:26.250
for your generosity,
Mr. Scrooge.

00:28.117 --> 00:29.751
Speaking of generosity,

00:29.751 --> 00:31.684
check out what
I got Chelsea.

00:31.684 --> 00:33.351
Diamond earrings.
Nice.

00:33.351 --> 00:35.451
Yeah. She dropped
a couple of hints

00:35.451 --> 00:36.917
about stuff she wanted.

00:36.917 --> 00:39.284
But I wasn't really listening,
so I got her these.

00:39.284 --> 00:41.384
How romantic. Will she be
joining us for dinner?

00:41.384 --> 00:42.850
I think so.

00:42.850 --> 00:44.883
She's out doing some
last minute shopping.

00:44.883 --> 00:48.117
Or something with work, again,
I wasn't really listening.

00:48.983 --> 00:50.983
Why did you mail me
a letter?

00:50.983 --> 00:53.983
Oh, I decided to send out a
Harper Christmas Newsletter.

00:53.983 --> 00:56.584
You know, keep everybody
updated on all things Harper.

00:56.584 --> 00:58.017
You're kidding.

00:58.017 --> 00:59.451
(in Dickensian accent):
Don't worry, governor,

00:59.451 --> 01:01.317
I didn't mention your
ongoing battle

01:01.317 --> 01:04.184
with the demon rum.

01:06.017 --> 01:08.217
(sighs)

01:09.317 --> 01:12.150
"As this wonderful year
draws to an end,

01:12.150 --> 01:14.718
"I send this note
to family and friend.

01:14.718 --> 01:17.351
"So thankful are we
for blessings galore.

01:17.351 --> 01:19.384
"Like Charlie's fiancÃ©e--

01:19.384 --> 01:22.417
a lady, not a whore."

01:22.417 --> 01:24.150
Keep reading.

01:24.150 --> 01:26.017
(sighs)

01:26.017 --> 01:28.718
"And young master Jake is
growing like a weed.

01:28.718 --> 01:31.983
He makes us all proud,
not a waste of my seed."

01:33.084 --> 01:35.017
Keep going, keep going.

01:35.017 --> 01:37.017
"He tried his darnedest
in every class.

01:37.017 --> 01:39.850
And made tenth grade
by the skin of his ass."

01:39.850 --> 01:41.617
And, see, I put in
a little drawing

01:41.617 --> 01:43.117
of an elf with
his pants down.

01:43.117 --> 01:45.150
What the hell's
the matter with you?

01:45.150 --> 01:46.384
You're a grown man.

01:46.384 --> 01:47.883
Oh, come on, people
love this stuff.

01:47.883 --> 01:48.883
Read, read.

01:48.883 --> 01:50.217
(sighs)

01:50.217 --> 01:53.184
"And our sweet mother Evelyn
had a small operation.

01:53.184 --> 01:56.551
Her secret garden needed
rejuvenation."

01:56.551 --> 01:58.584
Secret garden?

01:58.584 --> 02:00.718
Find a rhyme for vulva.

02:01.818 --> 02:03.883
I dare you.

02:03.883 --> 02:05.117
(sighs)

02:05.117 --> 02:07.017
"And what about the author
of this Christmas poem?

02:07.017 --> 02:09.850
"He's healthy and happy
in his beautiful home.

02:09.850 --> 02:12.351
"And while some might argue
that he's just a leech,

02:12.351 --> 02:14.950
it bothers him not,
he lives at the beach."

02:16.950 --> 02:19.751
"Happy Holidays
from the Happy Harpers."

02:19.751 --> 02:21.751
What do you think?

02:21.751 --> 02:24.684
You're sad, pathetic,
lonely and blue.

02:24.684 --> 02:27.784
If I gave a rat's ass,
I'd worry about you.

(with pirate voice):
Expecting rough
weather, Captain?

02:42.484 --> 02:44.584
What?

02:46.050 --> 02:47.617
(normal voice):
What you looking at?

02:47.617 --> 02:48.983
Uh, nothing.

02:48.983 --> 02:50.351
Really?

02:50.351 --> 02:51.983
So the beautiful girls
playing volleyball

02:51.983 --> 02:54.084
completely escaped
your eye?

02:54.084 --> 02:56.117
I see 'em, you perv.

02:56.117 --> 03:00.351
The little hottie
in the tank top is
checking you out.

03:00.351 --> 03:01.818
I know.

03:01.818 --> 03:04.150
Now please go away.

03:04.150 --> 03:06.950
Why don't you go
down there and
talk to her?

03:06.950 --> 03:08.150
I can't.

03:08.150 --> 03:09.351
Why not?

03:09.351 --> 03:10.917
I got a girlfriend.

03:10.917 --> 03:13.983
Oh, buddy, you can't
call the posters in
your room girlfriends.

03:13.983 --> 03:16.284
No, I'm talking
about Celeste.

03:16.284 --> 03:17.818
I'm in a committed
relationship.

03:17.818 --> 03:20.150
What are you talking
about? You're 13.

03:20.150 --> 03:21.351
I'm 15.

03:21.351 --> 03:23.551
Who cares?

03:23.551 --> 03:25.883
You're too young for
a committed relationship.

03:25.883 --> 03:27.850
I'm 40 and I'm
barely ready.

03:27.850 --> 03:29.017
You're 42.

03:29.017 --> 03:32.084
What is it with you
and numbers?

03:32.084 --> 03:34.017
Let me ask you something--

03:34.017 --> 03:35.551
where is Celeste
right now?

03:35.551 --> 03:37.950
She's spending Christmas
with her mom in Brentwood.

03:37.950 --> 03:40.551
So what, your life
just stops when she's gone?

03:40.551 --> 03:41.850
That's the deal we made.

03:41.850 --> 03:46.184
Listen to me, if you want
to go talk to the beach girl,

03:46.184 --> 03:48.551
you've got every
right to do so.

03:48.551 --> 03:49.818
Are you sure?

03:49.818 --> 03:52.950
I don't think so.

03:52.950 --> 03:54.017
Don't worry about it.

03:54.017 --> 03:55.084
Just go talk to her.

03:55.084 --> 03:56.584
Can I borrow ten bucks?

03:56.584 --> 03:57.584
Why?

03:57.584 --> 03:58.617
If she shoots me down,

03:58.617 --> 04:00.584
then I can go buy a
couple corn dogs.

04:00.584 --> 04:02.617
She's not going
to shoot you down.

04:02.617 --> 04:04.850
Yeah, but now I got
a taste for corn dogs.

04:04.850 --> 04:06.250
Just go.

04:06.250 --> 04:08.551
What if she wants
a corn dog?
She's about to meet one.

04:08.551 --> 04:09.784
Now get out of here.

04:12.351 --> 04:13.317
Do I look okay?

04:13.317 --> 04:16.651
Jake, she waved
at you. She smiled.

04:16.651 --> 04:19.216
Clearly her standards
aren't that high.

04:20.084 --> 04:21.882
Right. Thanks.

04:25.751 --> 04:28.751
When did I turn 42?

04:30.317 --> 04:33.451
Son of a bitch.

04:33.451 --> 04:36.517
Hey, I'm an organ donor.
Good for me.

04:36.517 --> 04:39.384
* Men, men, men, men, manly men,
men, men *

04:39.384 --> 04:42.617
* Men, men, men, men,
manly men, men, men *
* Ooh

04:42.617 --> 04:45.784
* Men, men, men, men,
manly men *
* Ooh
* Ooh

04:45.784 --> 04:48.384
* Ooh-ooh-ooh,
ooh-ohh, ooh-ooh... *

04:48.384 --> 04:50.818

05:06.184 --> 05:08.883
Hey, Berta, merry Christmas.

05:08.883 --> 05:10.784
Thank you, Charlie.

05:10.784 --> 05:12.351
You're very generous.

05:12.351 --> 05:13.718
Well, I just want you to know

05:13.718 --> 05:15.184
that I appreciate
all your hard work.

05:15.184 --> 05:18.551
And I appreciate you pretending
I work hard.

05:18.551 --> 05:21.584
Hey, you feeling lucky?

05:21.584 --> 05:23.084
What do you got in mind?

05:23.084 --> 05:24.484
My Christmas bonus--

05:24.484 --> 05:27.184
double or nothing that Zrbnck
makes the field goal.

05:27.184 --> 05:28.484
Are you crazy?

05:28.484 --> 05:29.751
That's 52 yards.

05:29.751 --> 05:31.584
He hasn't made one
that long all year.

05:31.584 --> 05:32.684
I got a hunch.

05:32.684 --> 05:33.950
You got a bet.

05:33.950 --> 05:35.150
ANNOUNCER:
There's the snap.

05:35.150 --> 05:36.117
The kick is up.

05:36.117 --> 05:37.718
It's long enough,
but wide.

05:37.718 --> 05:39.217
It's no good.

05:39.217 --> 05:41.818
Zrbnck's missed another one.

05:41.818 --> 05:44.284
Well, happy birthday, Jesus.

05:47.250 --> 05:49.384
Told ya.

05:49.384 --> 05:50.718
No biggie.

05:50.718 --> 05:52.818
Easy come, easy go.

05:52.818 --> 05:54.184
Sorry.

05:54.184 --> 05:56.250
Looks like the grandkids
are getting

05:56.250 --> 05:58.551
beef jerky and Lotto scratchers
this year.

06:00.784 --> 06:03.451
Here.

06:03.451 --> 06:04.850
You're too kind.

06:04.850 --> 06:05.883
Don't mention it.

06:05.883 --> 06:07.217
You got a big heart.

06:07.217 --> 06:08.784
Thank you.

06:08.784 --> 06:12.250
Double or nothing
they don't make
the first down.

06:12.250 --> 06:14.317
Hey.

06:14.317 --> 06:15.451
Oh, hey. Where you been?

06:15.451 --> 06:17.117
Out on the beach.

06:17.117 --> 06:18.150
So, how'd it go?

06:18.150 --> 06:19.451
Fine. I'm getting
her a grape soda.

06:19.451 --> 06:20.584
No, no, no, no, no.

06:20.584 --> 06:22.584
You don't bring the grape soda
to her.

06:22.584 --> 06:24.250
You bring her
to the grape soda.

06:24.250 --> 06:25.250
Her who?

06:25.250 --> 06:26.217
Hang on.

06:26.217 --> 06:27.284
You bring her here.

06:27.284 --> 06:28.517
She sees your beautiful house.

06:28.517 --> 06:30.451
She thinks you've got
it going on,

06:30.451 --> 06:32.150
and then you've got a shot at...

06:34.117 --> 06:36.850
Well, I don't know what you got
a shot at, but you got a shot.

06:36.850 --> 06:38.983
Whoa, whoa, catch me up.

06:38.983 --> 06:40.317
Do you see what I'm saying?

06:40.317 --> 06:41.751
So I should bring her here?

06:41.751 --> 06:43.217
Absolutely.

06:43.217 --> 06:44.651
Women love this house.

06:44.651 --> 06:45.751
It's an aphrodisiac.

06:45.751 --> 06:48.184
I don't think
she's afro anything.

06:49.983 --> 06:51.818
She's more like Chinese.

06:51.818 --> 06:53.950
Wait, who's Chinese?
What's going on?

06:53.950 --> 06:56.150
He met a girl on the beach
and I'm helping him out.

06:56.150 --> 06:57.950
What about Celeste?

06:57.950 --> 07:00.417
Uncle Charlie said my life
shouldn't stop just 'cause
she's not around.

07:00.417 --> 07:03.517
So you're encouraging my son
to cheat on his girlfriend?

07:03.517 --> 07:05.150
Oh, come on, there's
no cheating going on.

07:05.150 --> 07:06.818
Are you cheating?
I'm not sure.

07:06.818 --> 07:07.818
You're not cheating.

07:07.818 --> 07:09.117
Yes, he is.

07:09.117 --> 07:10.883
How would you feel if Celeste
was somewhere right now

07:10.883 --> 07:12.050
flirting with
some other guy?

07:12.050 --> 07:13.451
How do you know she's not?

07:13.451 --> 07:14.484
She's with her mom.

07:14.484 --> 07:16.150
And you're with your dad,

07:16.150 --> 07:18.150
but that's not stopping
you, is it?

07:18.150 --> 07:19.517
Good point.

07:19.517 --> 07:21.517
No, no, it's a lousy point.

07:21.517 --> 07:24.150
Relationships are built on
trust and mutual respect.

07:24.150 --> 07:25.684
Oh, grow up.

07:25.684 --> 07:28.751
Relationships are built on
diamond earrings and Viagra.

07:30.150 --> 07:32.451
Now go take the young lady
her grape soda.

07:32.451 --> 07:33.651
I still think it would help

07:33.651 --> 07:35.784
if I had some corn dog money
to flash around.

07:35.784 --> 07:37.451
Go.

07:39.651 --> 07:40.917
Shame on you.

07:40.917 --> 07:42.451
What's the big deal?

07:42.451 --> 07:44.617
It's not like he and
this Celeste girl are
sleeping together.

07:44.617 --> 07:47.651
No, no, but I think that
once a relationship reaches
any physical level,

07:47.651 --> 07:48.983
there's an implied
commitment.

07:48.983 --> 07:51.484
Yeah, that's because
you married the first girl

07:51.484 --> 07:53.551
who touched your wiener.

07:53.551 --> 07:55.317
Not true.

07:55.317 --> 07:58.617
The first girl who touched my
wiener was Maxine Chernakoff.

07:58.617 --> 08:00.917
And she refused to marry me.

08:02.284 --> 08:07.284
As did the blind girl
at camp, the school nurse

08:07.284 --> 08:11.451
and crazy cousin Wendy.

08:11.451 --> 08:13.784
* Men.

08:15.684 --> 08:17.983
I hope you're
proud of yourself.

08:17.983 --> 08:20.184
I'm more proud of him.

08:20.184 --> 08:22.084
I mean, he actually
got her back here

08:22.084 --> 08:23.451
without hitting
her over the head

08:23.451 --> 08:25.150
and stuffing her
in a burlap sack.

08:26.651 --> 08:28.217
Pretty girl.

08:28.217 --> 08:29.417
Yep.

08:29.417 --> 08:31.551
You'd think she'd have
more self-esteem.

08:32.650 --> 08:35.217
Hey, Jake may be dull-witted,
but he does have

08:35.217 --> 08:37.517
a certain je ne sais quoi
with the ladies.

08:37.517 --> 08:41.049
Well, maybe six years of picking
his underwear up with a rake

08:41.049 --> 08:43.250
has made me immune
to his charms.

08:44.883 --> 08:46.517
Hey.

08:46.517 --> 08:49.651
Hey. Nice work talking her
into coming back here.

08:49.651 --> 08:51.317
I didn't really talk
her into it.

08:51.317 --> 08:52.718
She had to pee.

08:52.718 --> 08:55.983
Yeah, but you gave her the
grape soda that made it happen.

08:56.818 --> 08:58.818
Now, Jake, you're
just hanging out

08:58.818 --> 09:00.517
with this girl, right--
as friends?

09:00.517 --> 09:02.250
So far.
What does that mean?

09:02.250 --> 09:04.150
It means I haven't
made my move yet.

09:04.150 --> 09:05.917
What move?

09:05.917 --> 09:07.017
I'm not sure.

09:07.017 --> 09:08.384
That's why I haven't
made it yet.

09:09.584 --> 09:11.317
Anyways, I don't think
it's going to get serious.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.417
She doesn't even live here.

09:12.417 --> 09:13.751
She doesn't?

09:13.751 --> 09:15.950
No, she's just in town
for the holidays
visiting her aunt.

09:15.950 --> 09:18.850
She pronounced it "awnt,"
but I figured it out.

09:18.850 --> 09:23.250
Oh, dude, you have
hit the jackpot here.
I have?

09:23.250 --> 09:26.718
This girl is most likely
looking for a hot story

09:26.718 --> 09:28.284
to tell her friends
back home,

09:28.284 --> 09:30.351
and you, you cute, little,
clueless bastard,

09:30.351 --> 09:32.150
can be the star
of that story.

09:32.150 --> 09:33.217
Really?

09:33.217 --> 09:34.751
Yes, so stop
wasting time.

09:34.751 --> 09:36.351
What are you even
doing in here?

09:36.351 --> 09:38.917
I had to fart, and I didn't want
to do it in front of her.

09:38.917 --> 09:42.818
Attaboy. Good thinking.

09:42.818 --> 09:45.417
I thought it was you.
I thought it was you.

09:45.417 --> 09:46.651
(doorbell ringing)

09:46.651 --> 09:48.584
Oh, that must be Mom.

09:48.584 --> 09:50.617
Mom? What's Mom doing here?

09:50.617 --> 09:51.983
Well, it's Christmas Eve,
Charlie.

09:51.983 --> 09:55.384
I know. Why isn't she out
stealing toys in Whoville?

09:58.017 --> 10:01.384
Merry Christmas,
one and all.

10:01.384 --> 10:02.384
Hello.
Hi, Mom.

10:02.384 --> 10:05.484
Boys, this is the
legendary TV producer

10:05.484 --> 10:07.084
Mr. Marty Pepper.

10:07.084 --> 10:08.384
Hi.
Hello.

10:08.384 --> 10:10.484
(loudly):
Marty, these
are my sons,

10:10.484 --> 10:12.150
Charlie and Alan.

10:12.150 --> 10:15.117
Is it important
which is which?

10:15.117 --> 10:17.718
Not really.

10:17.718 --> 10:20.250
Would you help me
with the wheelchair?

10:20.250 --> 10:22.451
I'll call you Scooter.

10:22.451 --> 10:26.317
And you, uh, Dutch.

10:26.317 --> 10:29.050
Uh, Mom...

10:29.050 --> 10:31.284
are, uh, are you
and he, um...?

10:31.284 --> 10:32.784
Oh, good Lord, no.

10:32.784 --> 10:34.584
The man is 1,000 years old.

10:34.584 --> 10:37.818
It's a wonder his scrotum
doesn't get tangled up
in the wheels.

10:37.818 --> 10:40.617
So he's just a friend?

10:40.617 --> 10:42.050
Yes.

10:42.050 --> 10:45.084
And I just couldn't let him
spend Christmas Eve alone--

10:45.084 --> 10:47.617
rattling around his
25,000 square foot

10:47.617 --> 10:50.217
Beverly Hills mansion,
with adjoining guest house,

10:50.217 --> 10:52.883
Olympic size saltwater pool
and home theater.

10:52.883 --> 10:55.017
There it is.

10:55.017 --> 10:57.117
Are you really this
hard up for a listing?

10:57.117 --> 11:00.718
Alan, it's a $60-million home.

11:00.718 --> 11:02.983
My commission will be
almost $2 million.

11:02.983 --> 11:05.317
How much did you make last year?

11:06.684 --> 11:09.417
Welcome to our home,
Mr. Pepper!

11:09.417 --> 11:11.184
What are you shouting for?

11:11.184 --> 11:13.684
I'm incontinent, not deaf.

11:13.684 --> 11:14.818
Sorry.

11:14.818 --> 11:16.351
What?

11:17.818 --> 11:20.351
Have an Abba Zaba, Marty.

11:20.351 --> 11:21.718
Thank you.

11:21.718 --> 11:25.050
Did I ever tell you
I knew Lucille Ball?

11:25.050 --> 11:26.451
Yes, you did, dear.

11:26.451 --> 11:29.084
You know, she wasn't
a real redhead.

11:29.084 --> 11:31.084
Ask me how I know.

11:31.084 --> 11:33.250
Warning: it's dirty.

11:33.250 --> 11:34.617
(clicks tongue)

11:34.617 --> 11:38.484
Uncle Charlie, I think Celeste
knows I'm seeing another woman.

11:38.484 --> 11:39.617
What? Why?

11:39.617 --> 11:40.818
She's texting me.

11:40.818 --> 11:41.917
What are you talking about?

11:41.917 --> 11:43.184
Nothing, nothing.

11:43.184 --> 11:45.317
Jake has a shot
at some out-of-town strange.

11:45.317 --> 11:47.417
You see how he is
corrupting your grandson?

11:47.417 --> 11:49.084
Come on, Alan.

11:49.084 --> 11:50.883
It's out-of-town strange.

11:52.084 --> 11:54.184
Do you really have a shot?

11:54.184 --> 11:55.150
I don't know.

11:55.150 --> 11:56.351
Uncle Charlie seems
to think so.

11:56.351 --> 11:59.317
Tell her you wanna get her
her own sitcom.

11:59.317 --> 12:00.917
Never fails.

12:00.917 --> 12:01.883
(text alert plays)

12:01.883 --> 12:03.983
There she is again.
What do I do?

12:03.983 --> 12:06.117
Just text her back,
"Thinking of you."

12:06.117 --> 12:07.950
Which you are,
so you're not lying.

12:07.950 --> 12:09.284
Good, that's good.

12:09.284 --> 12:11.317
Okay, this may be your house,
but this is my son.

12:11.317 --> 12:13.284
Yeah, and you've been living
here seven years,

12:13.284 --> 12:16.917
<i>which makes us a common-law
couple, which makes him our son.</i>

12:17.718 --> 12:19.684
Homos with a kid.

12:19.684 --> 12:22.050
A great idea for a sitcom.

12:22.050 --> 12:23.883
(text alert plays)

12:23.883 --> 12:25.217
It worked.
She wrote back,

12:25.217 --> 12:26.451
"Merry Christmas,
I miz you."

12:26.451 --> 12:28.983
Then write back,
"I miz you, too."

12:28.983 --> 12:31.250
<i>Man, you are good.</i>

12:33.150 --> 12:34.551
Look at that.

12:34.551 --> 12:36.983
Our little boy is growing up.

12:36.983 --> 12:39.983
How would you feel about us
having another child?

12:44.751 --> 12:46.983
(piano playing
"Jingle Bell Rock")

12:46.983 --> 12:49.917
* Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock *

12:49.917 --> 12:53.484
* Jingle bells swing
and jingle bell ring *

12:53.484 --> 12:57.751
* Snowing and blowing up
bushels of fun *

12:57.751 --> 13:00.917
* Now the jingle hop
has begun *

13:00.917 --> 13:04.050
* Jingle bell, jingle bell,
jingle bell rock *

13:04.050 --> 13:07.983
* Jingle bells chime
in jingle bell time *

13:07.983 --> 13:11.751
* Dancing and prancing
in jingle bell square *

13:11.751 --> 13:14.617
* In the frosty air

13:14.617 --> 13:18.784
* What a bright time,
it's the right time *

13:18.784 --> 13:22.651
* To rock
the night away *

13:22.651 --> 13:25.917
* Jingle bell time is
a swell time *

13:25.917 --> 13:29.451
* To go glidin' in
a one-horse sleigh *

13:29.451 --> 13:32.718
* Giddy-up, jingle horse,
pick up your feet *

13:32.718 --> 13:35.250
* Jingle around the clock...

13:35.250 --> 13:37.050
Alan?

13:37.050 --> 13:39.584
* Mix and mingle
with the jinglin' feet *

13:39.584 --> 13:40.917
Alan?

13:40.917 --> 13:44.017
* That's the jingle bell,
that's the jingle bell... *

13:44.017 --> 13:46.317
Alan?!

13:55.718 --> 13:59.417
40 years ago you asked for a
little brother for Christmas.

13:59.417 --> 14:02.751
Happy?

14:02.751 --> 14:06.917
* That's the
jingle bell rock! *

14:11.917 --> 14:13.718
Could somebody move me?

14:13.718 --> 14:17.451
My chestnuts are roasting
by this open fire.

14:18.651 --> 14:19.818
Is that you?

14:19.818 --> 14:23.017
I thought Alan
burned the ham.

14:26.150 --> 14:29.250
Berta, don't you wanna spend
Christmas with your family?

14:29.250 --> 14:31.784
Do you wanna spend Christmas
with yours?

14:31.784 --> 14:34.317
Let me freshen your drink.

14:36.284 --> 14:39.651
What is that fragrance
you're wearing, my dear?

14:39.651 --> 14:42.284
Ben Gay and foot powder.

14:43.784 --> 14:47.184
Whatever it is,
it's making me hot.

14:47.184 --> 14:49.617
Turkey's almost done.

14:49.617 --> 14:51.417
Aren't you gonna put on
some nice clothes?

14:51.417 --> 14:53.417
Why? It's just
gonna be you, me,

14:53.417 --> 14:54.983
Chelsea, Berta, Mom

14:54.983 --> 14:57.451
and the ghost of showbiz past.

14:57.451 --> 14:58.684
And Jake.

14:58.684 --> 15:00.017
No, Jake split.

15:00.017 --> 15:01.017
What?

15:01.017 --> 15:02.684
He's hangin'
with his new girlfriend.

15:02.684 --> 15:03.818
Where?

15:03.818 --> 15:05.517
Her aunt's house.

15:05.517 --> 15:07.351
I think they got
the place to themselves,

15:07.351 --> 15:09.250
so he might get
a little, you know,

15:09.250 --> 15:10.517
peace on Earth tonight.

15:10.517 --> 15:13.584
How do you make everything
sound dirty?

15:13.584 --> 15:15.451
Hey, I took
the high road.

15:15.451 --> 15:18.150
I coulda gone with
"Come, all ye faithful."

15:18.150 --> 15:19.950
(sighs)

15:19.950 --> 15:21.883
He needs to be home.

15:21.883 --> 15:22.850
Oh, come on, Alan.

15:22.850 --> 15:24.284
He's got a real shot
with that girl.

15:24.284 --> 15:26.384
I don't care.
It's Christmas Eve.
So?

15:26.384 --> 15:28.751
So if I can't get laid,
nobody gets laid.

15:28.751 --> 15:30.150
Yeah, Jake,
this is your father.

15:30.150 --> 15:31.184
Whatever you're doing,

15:31.184 --> 15:33.584
I want you to stop it
and get your ass home.

15:33.584 --> 15:35.050
What's he doing?
Is he decking her hall?

15:35.050 --> 15:38.484
Shut up!

15:38.484 --> 15:40.551
Right now, mister!

15:40.551 --> 15:43.917
Fine, bring her back here
if you want.

15:43.917 --> 15:46.084
Yes, there's
still pie left.

15:46.084 --> 15:47.917
(doorbell rings)

15:49.551 --> 15:51.883
What are you lookin' at?

15:57.017 --> 16:00.451
How would you like
to have your own sitcom?

16:00.451 --> 16:03.150
Hi. Is Jake home?

16:03.150 --> 16:04.584
Um, I don't know.

16:04.584 --> 16:06.417
Sorry to intrude,
but Celeste wanted

16:06.417 --> 16:08.417
to give Jake
his Christmas present.

16:08.417 --> 16:09.484
Please come in.

16:09.484 --> 16:11.117
Aw, crap.

16:12.517 --> 16:13.617
Wow, check out the mom.

16:13.617 --> 16:14.818
Forget the mom.

16:14.818 --> 16:16.417
We gotta get
rid of 'em

16:16.417 --> 16:18.417
before Jake walks in here
with another girl.

16:18.417 --> 16:19.751
Yeah, yeah, good idea.

16:19.751 --> 16:23.017
Uh, hi, hi. I'm, uh, Alan,
Jake's divorced father.

16:23.017 --> 16:25.484
Keisha,
Celeste's mother.

16:25.484 --> 16:26.983
Her mother?

16:26.983 --> 16:28.617
Oh, please, you look
like her sister.

16:28.617 --> 16:29.784
You're sweet.

16:29.784 --> 16:31.484
And single.

16:31.484 --> 16:33.084
Where's Jake?

16:33.084 --> 16:36.250
Uh, um, uh, uh...

16:36.250 --> 16:40.084
Actually, he's, uh,
distributing corn dogs

16:40.084 --> 16:42.117
to the homeless tonight,

16:43.050 --> 16:44.850
But we'll make sure
he gets your gift.

16:44.850 --> 16:45.883
Thanks for stopping by.

16:45.883 --> 16:47.117
Merry Christmas.

16:48.917 --> 16:50.484
Jake?

16:50.484 --> 16:52.784
Oh, hi.

16:52.784 --> 16:54.250
Who's this?

16:54.250 --> 16:57.250
Um... I don't know.

17:00.751 --> 17:01.850
Who's she?

17:01.850 --> 17:03.684
Uh... Uncle Charlie?

17:03.684 --> 17:06.983
I don't know what
to tell ya, pal.

17:06.983 --> 17:09.217
It happens.

17:09.217 --> 17:11.517
You said you didn't have
a girlfriend!

17:11.517 --> 17:12.718
He doesn't!

17:12.718 --> 17:14.117
Would you like
some eggnog?

17:14.117 --> 17:16.150
You've got to be kidding.

17:17.718 --> 17:19.250
You want some pie?

17:19.250 --> 17:20.751
You are such a liar!

17:20.751 --> 17:22.384
Why all the yelling?

17:22.384 --> 17:23.451
What's going on?

17:23.451 --> 17:25.217
Uncle Charlie
just ruined my life.

17:25.217 --> 17:26.017
What?

17:26.017 --> 17:27.483
He said it was okay

17:27.483 --> 17:29.517
to see other girls as long as
my girlfriend wasn't around.

17:29.517 --> 17:31.117
Really?

17:31.117 --> 17:32.451
Is that what you believe?

17:32.451 --> 17:35.217
No, no, not at all.

17:35.217 --> 17:37.017
He completely misunderstood me.

17:37.017 --> 17:38.384
Merry Christmas!

17:38.384 --> 17:40.517
Yeah, right.

17:41.551 --> 17:43.551
Nice going.

17:46.517 --> 17:49.084
Would you like a lick?

17:49.751 --> 17:51.417
Not of that.

17:51.417 --> 17:53.317
* Men.

18:04.884 --> 18:07.183
You want to take
your hand off my leg?

18:07.183 --> 18:09.117
I certainly do not.

18:16.984 --> 18:18.717
Love you.

18:18.717 --> 18:20.951
Yeah. Who do you love
when I'm not around?

18:23.050 --> 18:24.450
Hey, Uncle Charlie?

18:24.450 --> 18:27.083
You really suck,
you know that?

18:27.083 --> 18:29.384
Yeah, I've been told.

18:29.384 --> 18:32.584
Listen, Jake, would it
be creepy for you

18:32.584 --> 18:35.217
if I called Celeste's mom?

18:35.217 --> 18:37.450
Are you insane?

18:37.450 --> 18:39.918
Think about it.

18:41.751 --> 18:45.250
Here you go, sweetie,
bite-size, easy to chew.

18:48.183 --> 18:50.717
Marty?

18:50.717 --> 18:51.951
Oh, God! Marty?

18:52.784 --> 18:55.784
Ha, just messin'
with you, ya vulture!

18:55.784 --> 18:58.817
She thinks she's gonna sell
my house when I'm dead,

18:58.817 --> 19:00.417
but I ain't goin'.

19:00.417 --> 19:03.183
Oops.

19:03.183 --> 19:06.384
<i>Actually, I am goin'.</i>

19:08.018 --> 19:11.150
Merry Christmas, everybody!
