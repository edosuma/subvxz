NEWSMAN: Belfast was in shock
this morning as the impact

07:55.562 --> 07:58.303
of last night's rioting
was all too clear.

07:58.478 --> 08:00.305
Small numbers of Catholics
still peacefully living

08:00.480 --> 08:02.612
in Protestant areas
were targeted.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.396
Their houses were attacked
and marked,

08:04.571 --> 08:05.920
and intimidation may force them

08:06.094 --> 08:07.791
to leave their homes
completely.

08:07.965 --> 08:10.011
Can these tightly-knit
neighborhoods ever return

08:10.185 --> 08:13.144

together only 24 hours ago?

to bring troops into Belfast

further clashes

10:02.210 --> 10:04.081

widely mentioned.

11:57.455 --> 11:59.327
-and talk to your granny?
-Hi, Pop.

11:59.501 --> 12:01.111
Hiya, Buddy.

12:03.026 --> 12:05.507

want to see you again?

12:05.681 --> 12:07.901
He's given me a letter
for the hospital.

12:08.075 --> 12:10.120
-PA: And did you go?
-There's no point.

12:13.471 --> 12:16.997
I think you've a few
big decisions to make, son.

12:19.956 --> 12:21.784

They weren't friends last night.

12:41.108 --> 12:42.631
They weren't
friends last night, though.

12:42.805 --> 12:45.242
BUDDY: Paddy Kavanagh told me
as long as Catholics

12:45.416 --> 12:48.158
keep confessing everything bad
that they do to a priest,

12:48.332 --> 12:49.812
then they can do
whatever they want

12:49.986 --> 12:51.596
and God will forgive them
all the time.

12:51.771 --> 12:53.381
Well, Paddy Kavanagh's
family's not gonna be living

12:53.555 --> 12:55.035
in this street for much longer,
so you'd better check

12:55.209 --> 12:56.906
he's not taking
the hand out of you.

23:51.081 --> 23:52.082
Good boys.

23:53.170 --> 23:56.043
MINISTER:
A fork in the road.

23:56.217 --> 24:01.004
In one direction,
a straight and narrow highway.

24:02.789 --> 24:05.313
Which road will you take?!

24:09.273 --> 24:10.666
MA:
You're running round here

24:10.840 --> 24:12.189
like the man
in the big picture,

24:12.363 --> 24:13.626
not paying your taxes

24:13.800 --> 24:14.844
and spending all our money
on horses.

24:15.018 --> 24:16.411
It's the building trade.

24:16.585 --> 24:18.152
I told you it doesn't work
the normal way.

24:18.326 --> 24:19.545
I told you I had it covered.

24:19.719 --> 24:21.068
I was the one
who had it covered.

24:21.242 --> 24:22.417
No, you had us paying
three years of back tax.

24:22.591 --> 24:24.027
To keep you out of bloody jail.

24:24.201 --> 24:26.334
We're drowning in debt.

24:26.508 --> 24:28.336
PA: We're near done
with the back tax.

24:28.510 --> 24:30.512
Ten pound a month
for three bloody years.

24:30.686 --> 24:32.819
This is the time to think
about making a new start.

24:32.993 --> 24:35.517
I know nothing else
but Belfast.

24:35.691 --> 24:37.040
Exactly.

24:37.214 --> 24:39.260
There's a whole world out there.

24:39.434 --> 24:41.523
We can give these boys a
better chance than we ever had.

24:41.697 --> 24:44.657
There's Commonwealth countries
needing tradesmen.

24:44.831 --> 24:47.050
The government will give you
assisted passage.

24:47.224 --> 24:49.183
We can get the whole family
to the other side of the world

24:49.357 --> 24:51.011
for ten pound.

24:51.185 --> 24:52.926
We're living in a civil war,

24:53.100 --> 24:56.190
and I'm not here
to protect my family.

24:58.975 --> 25:00.934
MA:
What are those supposed to be?

25:01.108 --> 25:03.153
PA:
An escape route.

25:10.160 --> 25:12.467
SOLDIER:
Get this street locked down.

25:12.641 --> 25:14.817
GIRL: Come on, get a move on.
We're gonna be late again.

25:14.991 --> 25:16.427
-Come on!
-

25:16.602 --> 25:17.994
:
Throughout the night,

25:18.168 --> 25:20.127
sniping became
the tactic of the rioters.

25:20.301 --> 25:21.824
As we drove past a side street,

25:21.998 --> 25:24.435
three men on the corner
dived for cover.

25:24.610 --> 25:25.915
-It's not bad, though, is it?
-A young man with a revolver

25:26.089 --> 25:27.613
asked us for a lift.

25:27.787 --> 25:29.745
At 4:00 this morning,
RUC turned us back

25:29.919 --> 25:31.791
-from the Falls area.
-Yeah.

25:31.965 --> 25:33.880
NEWSMAN: Snipers, they said,
were still at work,

25:34.054 --> 25:36.056
and in the distance,
one heard the ominous burst

25:36.230 --> 25:37.623
of machine-gun fire.

25:37.797 --> 25:39.668
The scene terrified me,

25:39.842 --> 25:42.192
but it reminded an
American colleague of Harlem,

25:42.366 --> 25:44.151
but, he added, it seems easier
to get guns here.

25:44.325 --> 25:46.109
MA:
One more left.

25:46.283 --> 25:48.459
NEWSMAN: Dawn over Belfast
today showed a grim scene,

25:48.634 --> 25:50.418
buildings scarred by fire,

25:50.592 --> 25:52.594
thousands of pounds' worth
of damage caused,

25:52.768 --> 25:54.683
and, of course,
the tragic loss of life.

25:54.857 --> 25:57.860
It's been a night of shame for
Belfast, one that will live on

25:58.034 --> 25:59.209
in the memories
of its people...

25:59.383 --> 26:00.776
MA:
Come on, you two. School.

26:06.521 --> 26:08.044
MISS LEWIS:
Walking, please. No running.

26:08.218 --> 26:10.481
-BOY: Morning, miss.

26:10.656 --> 26:13.484
STUDENTS:
Twelve elevens are 132.

26:13.659 --> 26:17.401
Twelve twelves are 144.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.316
MISS LEWIS: Well, I'm pleased
to say your times tables

26:19.490 --> 26:20.840
were a lot more impressive
to hear

26:21.014 --> 26:22.363
than your test scores
were to read.

26:22.537 --> 26:23.625
The whole point
of these weekly tests

26:23.799 --> 26:25.584
is to monitor your progress.

26:25.758 --> 26:29.109
The best will sit directly by
my desk, the seat of learning,

26:29.283 --> 26:31.328
and the rest of you will view
your Sisyphean struggles

26:31.502 --> 26:33.504
from the distance
you have imposed upon yourself

26:33.679 --> 26:34.636
by a lack of application.

26:34.810 --> 26:37.291
Billy Clanton Junior, 17%.

26:37.465 --> 26:39.119
Bottom row, seat 12.

26:39.293 --> 26:41.121
Rachel, seat 11.

26:41.295 --> 26:42.513
Martin to seat ten.

26:42.688 --> 26:43.776
Freddie, seat eight.

26:43.950 --> 26:45.734
Karen to seat four.

26:45.908 --> 26:50.173
And in the medal positions
this week, with 72%, in bronze,

26:50.347 --> 26:52.393
is Buddy, seat three.

26:54.090 --> 26:55.962
And, of course, in silver
again, we have Ron,

26:56.136 --> 26:58.791
and Catherine with
the gold yet again this week.

26:58.965 --> 27:01.228
Congratulations, Catherine.
Very well done.

27:07.147 --> 27:10.672
The wee girl still showing
some interest, yeah?

27:10.846 --> 27:13.588
She looks at me sometimes,
but we're not allowed to talk

27:13.762 --> 27:16.330
in the class,
so I can't say anything.

27:16.504 --> 27:17.984
And then when we go out
to the playground,

27:18.158 --> 27:20.464
she always goes off
with the other girls.

27:21.770 --> 27:23.554
Anyways, I think
she loves that other fella.

27:23.729 --> 27:25.992
Ah, you don't know that
for sure.

27:26.166 --> 27:28.385
Women are very mysterious.

27:28.559 --> 27:30.866
And women can smash
your face in, too, mister.

27:31.040 --> 27:33.913
Your granny's become
less mysterious over the years.

27:34.087 --> 27:35.697
So, you really like her?

27:35.871 --> 27:38.613
When I grow up,
I want to marry her.

27:38.787 --> 27:41.007
Yeah, sounds like
you really like her.

27:41.181 --> 27:43.792
You know,
she's not only at school.

27:43.966 --> 27:46.839
You could see
where she lives maybe.

27:47.013 --> 27:49.058
It's Reynolds Drive,
four houses in from the right,

27:49.232 --> 27:50.451
the one with the wonky eight.

27:50.625 --> 27:52.453
Oh, you've done your research.

27:52.627 --> 27:55.108
I pass it every day
on my way home.

27:55.282 --> 27:58.154
I try to look in,
but she never sees me.

27:58.328 --> 28:00.417
She's always doing
her bloody homework.

28:00.591 --> 28:02.637
If she were a wee bit
more stupid like me,

28:02.811 --> 28:04.595
we'd be sitting together
by now.

28:04.770 --> 28:08.687
Ah, "a pity beyond all telling
is hid in the heart of love."

28:08.861 --> 28:10.689
Oh, he's full of
pretty answers, that one.

28:10.863 --> 28:12.168
Come on, it's time to go.

28:12.342 --> 28:13.604
I don't want your mommy
shouting at me

28:13.779 --> 28:14.823
because you're late.

28:14.997 --> 28:16.999
-Cheerio, son.
-Cheerio.

28:20.481 --> 28:22.875
GRANNY:
Here, take this threepenny bit.

28:23.049 --> 28:24.790
Get yourself a wee sweetie.

28:24.964 --> 28:26.487
I'm not allowed, Granny.

28:26.661 --> 28:28.619
My da says you can't afford it.

28:28.794 --> 28:30.230
I'm always saying
to your man there

28:30.404 --> 28:32.232
what's yours is mine
and what's mine's me own.

28:32.406 --> 28:34.147
Thanks, Granny.

28:34.321 --> 28:37.324
Try and find out
how that wee girl thinks.

28:37.498 --> 28:38.934

33:50.289 --> 33:53.074
God. This takes ages.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.120
No wonder they call it
long division.

33:55.294 --> 33:57.644
Patience.
Patience with the sums.

33:57.818 --> 34:00.038
Patience with the girl.

34:00.212 --> 34:01.996
Is it 27?

34:03.215 --> 34:05.260
That's close enough.

34:05.434 --> 34:06.957
And now just make sure
y-your numbers

34:07.132 --> 34:08.829
aren't very clear to read.

34:09.003 --> 34:10.700
She might give you
the benefit of the doubt

34:10.874 --> 34:15.444
if your seven looks like a one
with a fancy tail, right?

34:15.618 --> 34:18.317
The same with a two and a six.

34:18.491 --> 34:20.188
Right? Keep her guessing.

34:20.362 --> 34:22.799
That means you'll have two
or three horses in every race.

34:22.973 --> 34:24.671
Isn't that cheating?

34:24.845 --> 34:27.500
No, well, I'd call it
spread betting.

34:27.674 --> 34:31.156
And if it gets you moved up by
one seat to bask in the light

34:31.330 --> 34:33.549
of her glory,
then you're off to the races.

34:33.723 --> 34:36.030
But sure there's only one
right answer.

34:36.204 --> 34:37.771
If that were true, son,
people wouldn't be

34:37.945 --> 34:40.208
blowing themselves up
all over this town.

34:44.430 --> 34:47.346
I think my da wants us
to leave Belfast.

34:52.090 --> 34:54.222
What do you want?

34:54.396 --> 34:58.879
Every night, before I go to
sleep, when I say my prayers,

34:59.053 --> 35:01.664
I ask God if he'd fix it
so that when I wake up

35:01.838 --> 35:04.885
in the morning, I'm the best
footballer in the world.

35:05.059 --> 35:07.453
And then I also ask him as well

35:07.627 --> 35:10.238
that when I grow up,
can I marry Catherine.

35:10.412 --> 35:12.153
Even if she loves Ronnie Boyd.

35:12.327 --> 35:14.808
But she could still see him,
but she'd marry me.

35:14.982 --> 35:16.679
That's what I want.

35:24.644 --> 35:26.428
LIBERTY VALANCE: You looking
for trouble, Doniphon?

35:26.602 --> 35:28.778
DONIPHON:
You aim to help me find some?

35:30.258 --> 35:31.564
What's the matter?

35:31.738 --> 35:33.392
Everybody in this country
kill crazy?!

35:33.566 --> 35:34.567
Here!

35:35.611 --> 35:37.657
VALANCE:
Show's over for now.

35:39.485 --> 35:41.269
DONIPHON:
Try it, Liberty.

35:42.140 --> 35:43.663
Just try it.

35:43.837 --> 35:45.317
STODDARD: What right
do you have to interfere?

35:45.491 --> 35:46.970
It was me he tripped.

35:47.145 --> 35:48.842
I have to keep those boys
where I can see 'em.

35:49.016 --> 35:50.670
PA: Well, I can't come home
every weekend, for God's sake.

35:50.844 --> 35:52.541
Well, if you can't be bothered,
well, then don't blame me

35:52.715 --> 35:54.195
-for what them boys get up to.
-That's not what I'm saying.

35:54.369 --> 35:56.154
-You can't just throw
that one... -

35:59.026 --> 35:59.983
MAN:
Right, that's 6:00 a.m., fellas.

36:00.158 --> 36:02.029
That's youse done.

36:03.161 --> 36:04.901

Housewives, it's thanks to

36:05.075 --> 36:06.990
Sparkle biological
washing powder

36:07.165 --> 36:08.601
that their whites
are whiter than ever.

36:08.775 --> 36:10.255
They've discovered
for themselves...

36:10.429 --> 36:11.778
MA:
What have I done?

36:15.695 --> 36:17.914
BUDDY:
All right, Mummy?

36:18.088 --> 36:20.700
Why do you always get sad
when a letter comes?

36:21.875 --> 36:24.573
WOMAN: Remember, our
washing powder is biological.

36:26.532 --> 36:28.490
MISS LEWIS:
Come on, Mr. Slowpoke.

36:28.664 --> 36:30.666
Get inside now.

36:30.840 --> 36:33.191
And finally a switch in
the medal positions this week.

36:33.365 --> 36:34.931
Well, Mr. Buddy,
you may not have improved

36:35.105 --> 36:37.456
your handwriting in maths,
for which this once,

36:37.630 --> 36:39.632
in lieu of your intensified
efforts, we will be willing

36:39.806 --> 36:41.111
to give you
the benefit of the doubt,

36:41.286 --> 36:43.766
but you have
improved your score.

36:43.940 --> 36:47.509
So, in second position
is Buddy.

at the wee mission says.

37:50.006 --> 37:51.573
When is your next chance?

37:51.747 --> 37:54.620
We have to do a project
about the moon landing.

37:54.794 --> 37:56.883
What, did those boys
not come back from that?

37:57.057 --> 37:59.842
They did, and now we have to
cut things out of the papers

38:00.016 --> 38:01.844
and explain how they got there.

38:02.018 --> 38:03.803
If they did get there,
if they did get to the moon.

38:03.977 --> 38:05.370
It's not what it says here.

38:05.544 --> 38:07.676
God doesn't like it.

38:07.850 --> 38:10.418
And I watched every night, too,
that they were up there,

38:10.592 --> 38:12.246
and how did I never see
Mike Collins

38:12.420 --> 38:14.814
in the mother ship
doing his orbit?

38:14.988 --> 38:16.598
Sure you would have seen
the shape of Columbus

38:16.772 --> 38:18.121
against the light of the moon.

38:18.296 --> 38:19.993
No, that's 'cause mostly
he was on the dark side.

38:20.167 --> 38:22.474
Exactly. It's the side that
Lucifer hangs his shillelagh.

38:22.648 --> 38:25.041
What? No, look, he was
on the dark side of the moon

38:25.215 --> 38:27.174
most of the time where
we couldn't see him, you know,

38:27.348 --> 38:29.481
while he was doing his orbit,
and then maybe, you know,

38:29.655 --> 38:31.526
just before he was due
to come round the corner,

38:31.700 --> 38:33.267
you had to go in for your tea.

38:33.441 --> 38:35.748
If I could come up with
something smart about that,

38:35.922 --> 38:37.706
maybe I could
stay up at the top desk

38:37.880 --> 38:39.534
and wait till
she gets back there.

38:39.708 --> 38:41.493
Or you could say the moon's
made of green cheese

38:41.667 --> 38:43.103
and drop down a place,
if you wanted.

38:43.277 --> 38:44.496
Or you could do
the project together,

38:44.670 --> 38:46.193
you and the young lady.

38:46.367 --> 38:47.673
You'd get the same marks

38:47.847 --> 38:49.762
and maybe end up
on the same seat together.

38:49.936 --> 38:51.633

39:59.788 --> 40:01.094

40:02.138 --> 40:03.792
Well done on your maths.

40:03.966 --> 40:05.620
Thanks.

Do you want to, with me?

40:12.410 --> 40:15.108
It'll save you getting cold
waiting outside our house.

MOIRA:
Hey, Romeo, come on!

40:20.983 --> 40:23.072
We have work to do.

40:23.246 --> 40:25.205
Operation Steal The Chocolate.

40:25.379 --> 40:27.120
It's simple.
We go into the shop

40:27.294 --> 40:28.904
and keep Mr. Singh talking
down by the fridge.

40:29.078 --> 40:30.819
He has to move the boxes
round at the bottom

40:30.993 --> 40:32.299
to get me a Lemon Mivvi.

40:32.473 --> 40:34.170
His head'll be down
part of the time.

40:34.344 --> 40:36.129
You stay at the front
of the shop,

40:36.303 --> 40:39.437
and when you see he's not
looking, you make a sweep.

40:39.611 --> 40:41.830
-What's a sweep? -A big grab
for all the chocolate bars

40:42.004 --> 40:43.702
on that low shelf
near the till.

40:43.876 --> 40:45.878
Sure he'll know they've been
nicked if there's a big gap.

40:46.052 --> 40:47.793
I thought you said
we'd just do a couple,

40:47.967 --> 40:49.490
so he'd never even notice.

40:49.664 --> 40:51.013
I don't want lifted
by the police.

40:51.187 --> 40:52.275
All right, all right.

40:52.450 --> 40:53.668
-GIRL: All clear.
-No sweep.

40:53.842 --> 40:55.322
Just a small grab, okay?

40:55.496 --> 40:57.106
I might be able to swipe you
a chocolate mousse

40:57.280 --> 40:58.804
-at the same time.
-Okay.

41:03.461 --> 41:05.114
-MOIRA: Hello, Mr. Singh.
-Hello, Moira. Hello, Buddy.

41:05.288 --> 41:06.638
-BUDDY: Hello, Mr. Singh.
-MR. SINGH: Good to see youse.

41:06.812 --> 41:08.117
MOIRA: Please may I have
a Lemon Mivvi?

41:08.291 --> 41:09.554
MR. SINGH:
Lemon Mivvi coming right up.

41:09.728 --> 41:11.643
Just need to move
a few wee boxes.

41:11.817 --> 41:13.209
-Hey!
-

41:13.383 --> 41:14.776
-He's seen us!
-Come here, you wee buggers!

41:14.950 --> 41:17.039
-I know who you are!
-MOIRA: No, he doesn't!

41:17.213 --> 41:20.260
BUDDY: Well, your woman
will tell him anyway!

41:20.434 --> 41:21.696
-You proud of yourself?
-It was Moira.

41:21.870 --> 41:23.481
Get in there.

41:23.655 --> 41:25.308
MAN: Get off that blinking road
or you'll kill somebody!

41:25.483 --> 41:27.093
She's gonna tell on us!

41:27.267 --> 41:29.269
She says anything,
she's done for!

41:29.443 --> 41:30.792
WOMAN:
I know who youse are!

41:36.319 --> 41:38.365
What have you got?

41:38.539 --> 41:41.020
You're joking me.

41:41.194 --> 41:42.500
It's all I could see.

41:42.674 --> 41:44.066
Turkish Delight?

41:44.240 --> 41:45.981
Who the hell
eats Turkish Delight?

41:46.155 --> 41:48.201
-Do you eat Turkish Delight?
-No.

41:48.375 --> 41:49.550
I don't like it.

41:49.724 --> 41:52.379
Nobody likes it.

41:52.553 --> 41:54.555
-It's all they had.
-Are you blind?

41:54.729 --> 41:56.035
I had to think quickly.

41:56.209 --> 41:57.558
Not quickly enough.

41:57.732 --> 42:00.343
There was Flakes and Crunchies.

42:00.518 --> 42:02.824
All you need is an in and out
with a fast hand,

42:02.998 --> 42:05.131
and then the Milky Bars
are on me.

42:05.305 --> 42:06.915
I'm not sure
you're cut out for this.

42:07.089 --> 42:09.570
-Hey, Buddy, your da's home.

42:09.744 --> 42:12.530
-Sure it's only Wednesday.
-He came in a taxi.

42:13.705 --> 42:15.576
-And you, too!
-What?

42:15.750 --> 42:17.752
Keep your mouth shut.

42:23.192 --> 42:25.020
PA:
When did you write to them?

42:25.194 --> 42:26.674
MA:
None of your business.

42:26.848 --> 42:28.241
PA: Just tell me.
When did you write to them?

42:28.415 --> 42:29.634
-It's a simple question.
-None of your business.

42:29.808 --> 42:31.505
PA:
Just give me a simple answer.

42:31.679 --> 42:33.681
-I'm not getting interrogated.
-When did you write to them?

42:33.855 --> 42:35.509
MA: When the last receipt
came through.

42:35.683 --> 42:37.250
I knew it was the last one
'cause for three bloody years

42:37.424 --> 42:38.817
I've been counting
them envelopes

42:38.991 --> 42:40.209
coming through that door,
and there wasn't

42:40.383 --> 42:41.602
so much as a thank-you
with this one.

42:41.776 --> 42:43.299
PA: It's the taxman,
for God's sake.

42:43.473 --> 42:44.736
Who do you expect,
Father Christmas?

42:44.910 --> 42:46.564
MA: We've been
scrimping and saving,

42:46.738 --> 42:49.001
and they hadn't the good grace
as to say, "That's it.

42:49.175 --> 42:50.524
You're done.
You're in the clear."

42:50.698 --> 42:52.526
So what'd you say to them
in your letter?

42:52.700 --> 42:55.485
I said I wanted
a full official declaration

42:55.660 --> 42:57.836
that my husband was
in the clear a hundred percent

42:58.010 --> 43:00.534
on all back taxes,
and that they acknowledged

43:00.708 --> 43:03.145
that everything was shipshape
and above board,

43:03.319 --> 43:04.494
and that my family's good name

43:04.669 --> 43:06.540
wasn't on
some credit risk list.

43:06.714 --> 43:09.151
-Christ. Christ the night.
-What?

43:13.242 --> 43:14.635
No.

43:14.809 --> 43:16.768
-No.
-Yes, yes, oh, yes.

43:16.942 --> 43:19.118
They've decided-- thanks
to acting on your request--

43:19.292 --> 43:21.773
they've decided to go back
further into my accounts

43:21.947 --> 43:24.036
and say that I owe
another 572 pound,

43:24.210 --> 43:25.646
which based on
current earnings,

43:25.820 --> 43:27.474
should take another
five years to pay off.

43:27.648 --> 43:29.389
So it's a handy wee letter
you sent, wasn't it?

43:29.563 --> 43:30.999
You bugger!

43:31.173 --> 43:32.958
-Oh, you're a lying bugger!
-

43:33.132 --> 43:35.351
Aye, that's right, believe the
taxman before you believe me!

43:39.704 --> 43:41.270
Your work won't be too pleased

43:41.444 --> 43:43.882
with you skipping off
in the week.

43:44.056 --> 43:45.274
I'll work the weekend.

43:45.448 --> 43:47.320
Ah, when's that job finish?

43:47.494 --> 43:49.017
This one's nearly done.

43:49.191 --> 43:51.585
What, there's another one
over there, is there?

43:51.759 --> 43:53.282
Aye. Big one.

43:53.456 --> 43:55.154
A long one.

43:55.328 --> 43:57.243
They're asking some of the boys
to move over permanent.

43:57.417 --> 43:59.680
Offering accommodation
because of the time involved.

43:59.854 --> 44:01.160
Couple of years.

44:01.334 --> 44:03.118
Building a hospital.

44:03.292 --> 44:05.251
Your father has to go
to the hospital.

44:05.425 --> 44:06.687
You talk to him about it.

44:06.861 --> 44:08.515
Won't talk to me about doctors.

44:08.689 --> 44:09.734
Is that right?

44:09.908 --> 44:11.736
Ah, it's just a couple of days.

44:11.910 --> 44:14.042
A wee test for the lungs.

44:14.216 --> 44:16.218
It's all that bloody time
over in Leicester.

44:16.392 --> 44:18.438
-Where's that?
-In England.

44:18.612 --> 44:20.266
Is that near where Daddy works?

44:20.440 --> 44:22.703
Nah, your daddy works near,
uh, London, the Big Smoke.

44:22.877 --> 44:25.053
This was in the countryside.

44:25.227 --> 44:26.533
What were you doing?

44:26.707 --> 44:28.143
I was a coal miner.

44:28.317 --> 44:29.928
You've done a lot
of different jobs, Pop.

44:30.102 --> 44:31.538
You can say that again.

44:31.712 --> 44:34.062
Yeah, none of them lasted
more than a week.

44:35.455 --> 44:37.413
My mother's worried about you.

44:37.587 --> 44:39.502
Your mother's worried about you.

44:41.069 --> 44:44.029
Well, Granny's always worried
about something, isn't she?

44:44.203 --> 44:46.901
Ah, well, your granny's
a very caring person.

44:47.075 --> 44:49.077
Sometimes it affects her nerves.

44:49.251 --> 44:50.426
Like your mommy.

44:50.600 --> 44:53.168
Mommy's worried, too, isn't she?

44:56.432 --> 44:59.914
Daddy, are we gonna
have to leave Belfast?

45:02.569 --> 45:05.006
PA: All right, Buddy,
that's me away, then.

45:05.180 --> 45:06.660
I'll see you
when I get back next week.

45:06.834 --> 45:08.444
MISS LEWIS: In you come, girls.
Catherine. Quinn.

45:08.618 --> 45:10.229
Come on in, girls. You can help
put the pencils out.

45:10.403 --> 45:12.100
PA:
Be good, son.

45:12.274 --> 45:13.493
If you can't be good?

45:13.667 --> 45:15.669
BOTH:
Be careful.

45:16.801 --> 45:18.411
BILLY:
Seems like only yesterday

45:18.585 --> 45:21.022
you and me were
in school together.

45:21.196 --> 45:23.982
You're gonna need to stay
away from my family.

45:24.156 --> 45:26.245
BILLY: That's big talk
for a fella who's never here.

45:26.419 --> 45:28.595
PA: You can rely on me
to be here when it matters.

45:28.769 --> 45:30.336
BILLY:
I hope your timing's good.

45:30.510 --> 45:33.165
Things get out of hand
pretty quick round these parts.

45:35.341 --> 45:38.300
Do you know the problem
with men like you?

45:38.474 --> 45:40.650
You think you're better
than the rest of us.

45:40.825 --> 45:43.915
And the problem with men like
you is you know you're not.

45:46.482 --> 45:48.093
We'll keep it simple.

45:49.572 --> 45:51.749
You're with us
or you're against us.

45:51.923 --> 45:52.924
Clock's ticking.

45:53.098 --> 45:54.403
You're a soft touch!

45:54.577 --> 45:56.405
Time for real Protestants
to step up!

45:56.579 --> 45:58.059
PA:
Ach, you're no real Protestant.

45:58.233 --> 46:00.801
You're a jumped-up gangster
and always were.

46:17.949 --> 46:19.646
MAN: There's peelers about.
Hey, watch it, youse two.

46:19.820 --> 46:21.300
WOMAN:
Quick.

46:29.569 --> 46:32.137
MA: Ah, look.
There you are now, son.

46:37.620 --> 46:39.318
Hello, son.

46:39.492 --> 46:41.624
The police officer here
just wants a wee word with you.

46:41.799 --> 46:43.452
There seems to be
a-a wee bit of confusion

46:43.626 --> 46:45.672
about something that happened
at Mr. Singh's.

46:45.846 --> 46:47.892
Go on, sit down there, now.

46:53.288 --> 46:55.856
POLICEMAN:
Do you know why I'm here, son?

46:56.030 --> 46:58.424
Don't lie to me.

46:58.598 --> 47:00.252
A very serious crime
has been committed

47:00.426 --> 47:01.819
down in Mr. Singh's shop.

47:01.993 --> 47:04.082
Do you know
what I'm talking about?

47:07.476 --> 47:09.827
All the best, now,
and give my regards to Josie.

47:10.001 --> 47:12.220
-POLICEMAN: I will do.
-I do like a man in a uniform.

47:12.394 --> 47:14.875
Was he in there long?

47:15.049 --> 47:17.530
Apples'll grow again, should
they grow on a gooseberry tree!

47:17.704 --> 47:19.532
I didn't even
eat the chocolate!

47:19.706 --> 47:22.840
: No, I won't
be here when it's over.

47:23.014 --> 47:24.711
You're asking me
to wait an hour to find out

47:24.885 --> 47:26.713
if I'm going to be
a wife or a widow.

47:26.887 --> 47:28.410
I say it's too long to wait.

47:28.584 --> 47:30.108
-I won't do it.
-WILL KANE: Amy...

47:30.282 --> 47:32.458
I mean it.
If you won't go with me now,

47:32.632 --> 47:34.939
I'll be on that train
when it leaves here.

47:36.157 --> 47:37.811
I've got to stay.

47:37.985 --> 47:39.857
No, you're not listening to me.

47:40.031 --> 47:42.033
:
I am listening. I am listening.

47:42.207 --> 47:43.556
Would you, would you listen
to me for a change?

47:43.730 --> 47:45.514
I'm trying to be practical
about this.

47:45.688 --> 47:47.299
MA: Look, the police were here
today but their father wasn't,

47:47.473 --> 47:48.822
so, no, I'll not be
having any lectures

47:48.996 --> 47:50.215
-from you, mister.
-Don't be like that.

48:59.762 --> 49:01.416

49:01.590 --> 49:03.941

49:04.115 --> 49:05.420
MR. STEWART:
Ah, just the fella.

49:05.594 --> 49:07.118
Have you got a horse
for the 2:30 race?

49:07.292 --> 49:08.728
I have, but if I tell you,
the odds'll come down.

49:08.902 --> 49:11.209
Christ, I'm not gonna
bet the house.

49:11.383 --> 49:13.211
Fancy Man, each way.
She'll get you a pint.

49:13.385 --> 49:16.083
-Is that Paddy moving out?
-Poor Catholics have no choice.

-It's a mad world.
-Well, get used to it.

49:17.867 --> 49:19.434
We all live there now.

49:20.479 --> 49:21.871
NEWSMAN:
Prize capture was a tanker

49:22.046 --> 49:24.744
laden with
2,500 gallons of petrol.

49:24.918 --> 49:27.138
They'd also taken dozens
of crates of milk bottles

49:27.312 --> 49:29.575
from a passing truck and
dubbed the whole enterprise

49:29.749 --> 49:31.316
the Petrol Bomb Factory.

49:31.490 --> 49:33.448
MA: Sure all the kids in
the street are going mad.

49:33.622 --> 49:35.146
PA:
What do you want me to do?

49:35.320 --> 49:37.539
MA:
You need to talk to them boys.

49:43.850 --> 49:45.634
How many was there?

49:45.808 --> 49:47.854
About ten of them.

49:48.028 --> 49:50.465
And what did your mate do?

49:50.639 --> 49:54.121
He said he wasn't joining
anything they belonged to.

49:54.295 --> 49:57.429
Then he gave the big one a dig
in the gob and ran like hell.

49:57.603 --> 49:59.344
So did I.

49:59.518 --> 50:01.346
Did they chase you?

50:01.520 --> 50:03.435
Aye, but we got
a street ahead of them.

50:03.609 --> 50:05.741
Then we ran into me Uncle
Tony's and turned the corner

50:05.915 --> 50:07.700
before they could see us.

50:07.874 --> 50:09.876
We put the heart across
me Uncle Tony.

50:10.050 --> 50:11.921
He was on the toilet,
doing his horses,

50:12.096 --> 50:14.576
and then he dropped his pencil
down the loo.

50:15.882 --> 50:18.276
You've delivered
for these boys before, aye?

50:18.450 --> 50:20.278
Mm-hmm.

50:20.452 --> 50:22.106
And you know it's not milk
they're putting

50:22.280 --> 50:24.543
back in them empty bottles?

50:24.717 --> 50:26.371
I do now, Daddy.

50:28.590 --> 50:30.636
You were right to tell me.

50:33.421 --> 50:35.380
Come here and hold this, son.

50:36.685 --> 50:38.078
Hold that there.

50:42.474 --> 50:44.432
-You got that?
-Mm-hmm.

50:44.606 --> 50:47.435
REPORTER: And amid more
citywide violence overnight,

50:47.609 --> 50:49.916
government figures issued today
reveal that Northern Ireland

50:50.090 --> 50:52.962
now has the highest rate
of unemployment in the UK.

50:53.137 --> 50:55.095
PA:
Here it is. Planet Earth.

50:55.269 --> 50:56.792
And do you know where that is?

50:56.966 --> 50:58.707
-Sydney.
-Australia?

50:58.881 --> 51:00.361
Aye, that's right.

51:00.535 --> 51:02.059
-Do you know about it?
-Aye.

51:02.233 --> 51:03.930
They've got surfing
and weird football.

51:04.104 --> 51:05.671
And they have kangaroos
on the barbecue.

51:05.845 --> 51:07.151
And the weather's good.

51:07.325 --> 51:08.848
Young Joe Turner's
down there, too.

51:09.022 --> 51:10.284
That's right.

51:10.458 --> 51:12.156
How do you fancy that?

51:12.330 --> 51:13.548
What?

51:13.722 --> 51:15.550
Moving over there
for a wee while.

51:15.724 --> 51:17.074
You're joking.

51:17.248 --> 51:18.901
No. It's just down the side
a wee bit.

51:19.076 --> 51:20.468
It's ten and a half
thousand miles.

51:20.642 --> 51:22.905
Right, school, you two-- now.

51:27.649 --> 51:30.304
We might as well be going to
the moon if we went down there.

51:30.478 --> 51:31.871
Sure, you've already
family there.

51:32.045 --> 51:33.133
One second cousin.

51:33.307 --> 51:34.569
And you've the phone.

51:34.743 --> 51:37.355
And a millionaire
to pay the bills?

51:37.529 --> 51:39.052
We could take trips back.

51:39.226 --> 51:41.228
And pay for it with what,
Scotch mist?

51:41.402 --> 51:43.361
Family could come over
for holidays.

51:43.535 --> 51:45.058
I didn't come up the loch
in a bubble.

51:45.232 --> 51:46.538
There's no one from round here

51:46.712 --> 51:48.148
can afford the fare
to go down there.

51:48.322 --> 51:50.368
Or the time off work,
if they had any work.

51:50.542 --> 51:51.978
You just heard the bloody news.

51:52.152 --> 51:53.762
We have to do something.

Otherwise, the rest of

58:10.182 --> 58:12.967

a wee garden for them boys?

58:15.100 --> 58:19.757

and everybody looks after them.

58:29.593 --> 58:32.900
them people's not gonna
understand a word we say.

58:34.336 --> 58:37.035

they'll take the hand out of us

58:37.209 --> 58:39.646
for sounding different.

58:39.820 --> 58:43.607
And the other half,
they'll hate us

'cause men here are killing
their young sons on our streets.

58:46.914 --> 58:49.743

we don't give a shite.

58:49.917 --> 58:52.398
And you think they're gonna
welcome us with open arms?

58:52.572 --> 58:55.444
What, and say, "Come on in.

58:55.619 --> 58:58.317
Well done for stealing
the house off of us"?

58:59.666 --> 59:01.668
Things change.

59:04.410 --> 59:06.891
Aye. They do.

59:10.503 --> 59:12.549

You need to decide by Christmas.

59:23.560 --> 59:25.953

59:26.127 --> 59:28.347
Be good. If you can't be good...

be careful."

1:01:26.421 --> 1:01:28.075
Ach, don't worry.

1:01:28.249 --> 1:01:30.948
Your mammy will persuade Santa
to bring some presents.

1:01:31.122 --> 1:01:33.341
Ach. Don't think so, Pop.

1:01:33.515 --> 1:01:34.908

1:01:36.736 --> 1:01:38.390
-It's the rent man.
-BUDDY: I'll get it, Mam.

1:01:38.564 --> 1:01:40.087
Shut your mouth.

1:01:40.261 --> 1:01:42.742
Is your mum in there, wee man?

1:01:42.916 --> 1:01:44.135
Nobody's here.

1:01:44.309 --> 1:01:45.745
-

1:01:45.919 --> 1:01:48.313
Oh, that puts me in mind
of a great wee system

1:01:48.487 --> 1:01:50.881
we had in the old days
for paying the rent.

1:01:51.055 --> 1:01:53.971
The rent man would come round
and collect the money

1:01:54.145 --> 1:01:56.147
for every house
in the whole street,

1:01:56.321 --> 1:01:58.279
and once he had done

1:01:58.453 --> 1:02:01.543
and all the rent books
were marked up to date,

1:02:01.718 --> 1:02:03.807
one of the boys would
hold him up at gunpoint

1:02:03.981 --> 1:02:05.547
in the back entry

1:02:05.722 --> 1:02:07.767
and take all the money
back off him,

1:02:07.941 --> 1:02:10.291
and then he'd hand it
straight back

1:02:10.465 --> 1:02:12.380
to all the residents
in the street,

1:02:12.554 --> 1:02:14.948
with a little commission
for the service.

1:02:15.122 --> 1:02:18.647
Yeah, it was
a very effective system.

1:02:18.822 --> 1:02:21.215
And the rent man was
so good about it in the end

1:02:21.389 --> 1:02:23.783
that eventually they cut him in
for a wee bit, too,

1:02:23.957 --> 1:02:26.307
and everybody was happy.

1:02:26.481 --> 1:02:29.136
Except for the council,
I suppose.

1:02:29.310 --> 1:02:32.052
His work's giving my da a house
in England now if he wants one.

1:02:32.226 --> 1:02:34.402
It's got a garden
and everything,

1:02:34.576 --> 1:02:37.275
and two toilets, and they're
both inside the house.

1:02:37.449 --> 1:02:39.581
There's nothing wrong
with an outside toilet,

1:02:39.756 --> 1:02:41.366
except on an aeroplane.

1:02:43.368 --> 1:02:46.023
My ma says,
if we went across the water,

1:02:46.197 --> 1:02:48.329
they wouldn't understand
the way we talk.

1:02:48.503 --> 1:02:49.983
That shouldn't be
a problem, son.

1:02:50.157 --> 1:02:51.898
I've been married
to your granny for 50 years.

1:02:52.072 --> 1:02:54.988
I've never understood
a word she's said.

1:02:55.162 --> 1:02:57.425
And if they can't
understand you,

1:02:57.599 --> 1:03:00.951
then they're not listening,
and that's their problem.

1:03:01.125 --> 1:03:02.604
You know, when I was
in Leicester,

1:03:02.779 --> 1:03:04.432
they said the same thing
about me.

1:03:04.606 --> 1:03:07.871
You know, so I put on
a different bloody accent

1:03:08.045 --> 1:03:09.655
every day just to annoy them.

1:03:09.829 --> 1:03:11.483
They never knew who I was.

1:03:11.657 --> 1:03:13.093
But I did,

1:03:13.267 --> 1:03:16.618
and that's the only one
who needs to know.

1:03:18.011 --> 1:03:19.534
You know who you are, don't you?

1:03:19.708 --> 1:03:21.232
Yes, Pop.

1:03:21.406 --> 1:03:25.714
You're Buddy from Belfast 15,

1:03:25.889 --> 1:03:27.716
where everybody knows you

1:03:27.891 --> 1:03:30.371
and your pop looks out for you

1:03:30.545 --> 1:03:32.373
and your mummy looks out
for you,

1:03:32.547 --> 1:03:34.898
your daddy looks out for you,
your granny looks out for you,

1:03:35.072 --> 1:03:36.421
your brother looks out for you,

1:03:36.595 --> 1:03:39.946
and the whole family
looks out for you.

1:03:40.120 --> 1:03:44.821
And wherever you go
and whatever you become,

1:03:44.995 --> 1:03:47.562
that'll always be the truth.

1:03:47.736 --> 1:03:50.435
And that thought
will keep you safe.

1:03:50.609 --> 1:03:53.046
It'll keep you happy.

1:03:53.220 --> 1:03:54.656
Will you remember that for me?

1:03:54.831 --> 1:03:57.137
-Yes, Pop.
-Aye.

1:03:57.311 --> 1:03:59.574
Fine man you are.

1:03:59.748 --> 1:04:02.099
Now, forget about

1:04:02.273 --> 1:04:05.058
what your father
and your mother want.

1:04:05.232 --> 1:04:07.017
What do you want?

1:04:08.148 --> 1:04:10.890
I want you
and my granny to come, too.

1:04:27.776 --> 1:04:29.735
-

1:04:29.909 --> 1:04:31.780
:
Hear me.

1:04:32.738 --> 1:04:35.436
Hear me.

1:04:35.610 --> 1:04:38.309
I am here tonight to warn you

1:04:38.483 --> 1:04:42.052
that you have yet
a chance and hope

1:04:42.226 --> 1:04:44.054
of escaping my fate.

1:04:44.228 --> 1:04:46.665
Who wears chains that size?

1:04:46.839 --> 1:04:49.102
: Granny, you're not
allowed to talk in the theater.

1:04:49.276 --> 1:04:50.843
It makes one heck of a necklace.

1:04:51.017 --> 1:04:53.541
You were always
a good friend to me.

1:04:53.715 --> 1:04:55.587
Thank you.

1:04:55.761 --> 1:04:59.156
You will be haunted.

1:05:01.593 --> 1:05:05.640
Is this the chance and hope
you mentioned, Jacob?

1:05:05.814 --> 1:05:07.599
It is.

1:05:07.773 --> 1:05:09.862
I think I'd rather not.

1:05:10.036 --> 1:05:11.951
Oh, I'm bloody well sure
you wouldn't.

1:05:27.358 --> 1:05:30.056
When will Pop get out
of the hospital?

1:05:30.230 --> 1:05:33.581
When the doctors say
his lungs are fine.

1:05:33.755 --> 1:05:35.932
When Pop went to England
to be a coal miner,

1:05:36.106 --> 1:05:37.759
did you go with him?

1:05:40.153 --> 1:05:42.025
Did you want to?

1:05:45.637 --> 1:05:47.639
Neither do I.

1:05:50.163 --> 1:05:52.470
Has your father said
what he's doing?

1:05:54.254 --> 1:05:57.475
He says it has to get decided
by Christmas.

1:05:57.649 --> 1:05:58.911
When's he coming back?

1:05:59.085 --> 1:06:00.173
At the weekend.

1:06:00.347 --> 1:06:01.827
We're going to the pictures.

1:06:02.001 --> 1:06:04.221
He's taking us to
Chitty Chitty Bang Bang.

1:06:04.395 --> 1:06:05.918
What in the name of God is that?

1:06:06.092 --> 1:06:07.006
It's a flying car.

1:06:07.180 --> 1:06:08.965
Oh, God, I've heard it all.

1:06:09.139 --> 1:06:11.489
It goes over a cliff, and you
nearly fall out of your seat.

1:06:11.663 --> 1:06:13.012
Do you want to come?

1:06:13.186 --> 1:06:15.319
It'll be company for you
till my pop's home.

1:06:15.493 --> 1:06:17.408
If God had wanted me
to see flying cars,

1:06:17.582 --> 1:06:19.453
I'd have been born
with blinking wings.

1:06:21.368 --> 1:06:23.196
You love your films, don't you?

1:06:24.545 --> 1:06:28.985
I was a great one for the
pictures when I was your age.

1:06:29.159 --> 1:06:31.596
I used to think you could
climb right inside the screen

1:06:31.770 --> 1:06:34.599
and visit all those
strange places you saw.

1:06:34.773 --> 1:06:36.818
Like that one in that film.

1:06:36.993 --> 1:06:38.516
What was that, uh...?

1:06:38.690 --> 1:06:39.908
Uh, Lost Horizons.

1:06:40.083 --> 1:06:41.649
-Did you ever see that?
-No.

1:06:41.823 --> 1:06:43.564
What was the name
of the place, Granny?

1:06:45.523 --> 1:06:47.003
Shangri-La.

1:06:47.177 --> 1:06:48.874
That's what they called it.

1:06:49.048 --> 1:06:51.050
Did you ever go there?

1:06:56.360 --> 1:06:58.188
There were no roads
to Shangri-La

1:06:58.362 --> 1:07:00.668
from our part of Belfast.

1:07:02.888 --> 1:07:04.803
So, will you go one day?

1:07:18.947 --> 1:07:20.819
-

1:07:20.993 --> 1:07:23.256
What? Where do they think
they're going?

1:07:23.430 --> 1:07:25.084
Look out!

1:07:34.441 --> 1:07:35.921
:
What's happening?

1:07:36.095 --> 1:07:37.749

1:07:37.923 --> 1:07:39.229

1:08:54.782 --> 1:08:57.002
We've a wee word
to have with you.

1:08:59.700 --> 1:09:03.443
Buddy, uh, Mum and I want
to talk to you about something,

1:09:03.617 --> 1:09:06.316
something that we might
have to do as a family.

1:09:07.708 --> 1:09:10.146
You know the way your dad's
over in England

1:09:10.320 --> 1:09:12.974
and he's been working
over there for quite a while?

1:09:13.149 --> 1:09:16.064
Well, we were thinking that,
uh, you know,

1:09:16.239 --> 1:09:18.850
maybe we'd all go as a family
and go live there.

1:09:20.852 --> 1:09:24.377
And, um, your dad's seen
a really nice wee house,

1:09:24.551 --> 1:09:27.206
and it's got
a lovely garden and...

1:09:27.380 --> 1:09:28.816
Play football, Buddy.

1:09:28.990 --> 1:09:30.818
-Aye.
-There's loads of room there.

1:09:30.992 --> 1:09:32.733
-More room than we have here.
-

1:09:32.907 --> 1:09:34.779
-I don't want to go to England!
-Could you switch that off?

1:09:34.953 --> 1:09:36.215
I don't want to go to England!

1:09:36.389 --> 1:09:37.434
It's all right, darling.

1:09:37.608 --> 1:09:38.783
-Hey, it's okay.
-It's all right.

1:09:38.957 --> 1:09:40.915
I'll have no friends
and no cousins,

1:09:41.089 --> 1:09:43.309
and I won't be able
to see Catherine at school!

1:09:43.483 --> 1:09:45.093
Hey, listen, you'll make new
friends, and you're gonna have

1:09:45.268 --> 1:09:46.573
a big garden
to play football in.

1:09:46.747 --> 1:09:48.096
I don't care about the garden!

1:09:48.271 --> 1:09:49.837
I want my granny and my pop,

1:09:50.011 --> 1:09:52.057
and I want to do my project
on going to the moon

1:09:52.231 --> 1:09:54.059
and get on the first desk,
and I don't want to

1:09:54.233 --> 1:09:55.669
-have to talk funny.
-Hey, hey, Buddy.

1:09:55.843 --> 1:09:57.367
And I don't want to forget
what road I have to

1:09:57.541 --> 1:09:58.672
-go down when I'm dead.
-That's enough now, darling.

1:09:58.846 --> 1:10:00.544
No one's asking you
to talk funny.

1:10:00.718 --> 1:10:02.415
-No decision's been made yet.
-It's all right. Exactly.

1:10:02.589 --> 1:10:03.721
No, we were just trying to see
what everyone thought first.

1:10:03.895 --> 1:10:05.331
-You're just overtired.
-Exactly. Yeah.

1:10:05.505 --> 1:10:08.116
I don't want to leave Belfast!

1:10:33.838 --> 1:10:36.188
Let's just leave it
till Easter.

1:10:36.362 --> 1:10:39.060
-See where we are then.
-: Aye.

1:10:39.235 --> 1:10:41.237
These boys are suffering.

1:10:43.195 --> 1:10:45.328
I don't think we've got
till Easter.

1:10:48.592 --> 1:10:51.203
I don't think you and me
have got till Easter, either.

1:10:56.643 --> 1:10:59.211
Well, come home.

1:10:59.385 --> 1:11:01.387
We'll fight this together.

1:11:02.519 --> 1:11:04.390
Kids the same age as ours

1:11:04.564 --> 1:11:06.566
are getting killed
around the corner.

1:11:08.699 --> 1:11:10.918
Well, we'll be careful.

1:11:12.790 --> 1:11:15.445
You can't be with them
24 hours a day.

1:11:16.750 --> 1:11:18.970
You can't take away
their childhood, either.

1:11:28.675 --> 1:11:32.418
You know, whatever happens...

1:11:35.116 --> 1:11:37.902
...what you've done
with these two,

1:11:38.076 --> 1:11:39.947
it's phenomenal.

1:11:42.472 --> 1:11:45.083
What are you talking about?

1:11:46.998 --> 1:11:48.913
You raised them.

1:11:50.567 --> 1:11:52.133
Not me.

1:11:53.091 --> 1:11:55.049
Not us.

You.

1:11:59.271 --> 1:12:01.055

We'll see what happens
by Easter.

1:12:06.974 --> 1:12:09.020

Oh, Mammy!

1:15:54.985 --> 1:15:56.377
We're looting the supermarket.

1:15:56.552 --> 1:15:57.944
Where did you get that?

1:15:58.118 --> 1:15:59.729
I told you, we're looting
the supermarket.

1:15:59.903 --> 1:16:01.295
You're what?

1:16:01.469 --> 1:16:03.210
You wait right there, young man.

1:16:07.475 --> 1:16:09.782
Why did you take
that washing powder?

1:16:09.956 --> 1:16:11.784
It's biological.

I will kill you.

Do you hear me?
And you, young madam,

1:16:40.857 --> 1:16:42.989

1:16:43.163 --> 1:16:46.210
I will beat you black and blue

1:16:46.384 --> 1:16:47.907

1:17:13.237 --> 1:17:15.413
We're clearing this area!
Move out the way now!

1:17:19.112 --> 1:17:20.418

If you try to run,

1:17:22.072 --> 1:17:23.334
I'll put a bullet

I can see your kind needs
a little discipline.

1:17:38.218 --> 1:17:40.090
You let them go now.

1:17:41.178 --> 1:17:42.658
No, I think if I do,

1:17:42.832 --> 1:17:45.051
one of them soldiers
is gonna take my head off.

1:17:46.052 --> 1:17:48.272
If they don't, I will.

1:17:49.273 --> 1:17:52.015
Over their dead bodies.

1:17:59.370 --> 1:18:01.720
Folks always have
a problem with change.

1:18:01.894 --> 1:18:04.244
But you'd better get
used to it, mister.

1:18:04.418 --> 1:18:08.031

There'll be no more bother.

1:20:39.486 --> 1:20:43.577
I caught sight of my face
in that shop window

1:20:43.751 --> 1:20:45.623
when I was running
down the street

1:20:45.797 --> 1:20:47.886
and dragging them poor kids
behind me.

1:20:51.759 --> 1:20:54.414
And I was looking
in the mirror just now...

1:20:56.242 --> 1:20:58.244
...at that same face.

1:21:01.421 --> 1:21:03.815
And I asked myself...

1:21:06.078 --> 1:21:08.341
"What the hell am I doing?"

1:21:16.219 --> 1:21:19.526
And then I was sick.

1:21:21.920 --> 1:21:24.662
Like I am every morning now.

1:21:33.540 --> 1:21:35.542
And I realized...

1:21:40.286 --> 1:21:42.723
...I don't think

1:21:42.898 --> 1:21:45.161
it really matters anymore.

1:21:48.904 --> 1:21:50.949
So, tomorrow...

1:21:54.083 --> 1:21:57.086
...when Uncle Mack
and Auntie Violet come round...

1:22:01.829 --> 1:22:04.093
...we're going to start
packing.

1:22:19.847 --> 1:22:22.589

You have no choice.

1:22:22.763 --> 1:22:26.376
You know they're gonna come

1:22:26.550 --> 1:22:30.380
And this time,
they'll send somebody serious.

1:22:32.425 --> 1:22:34.819
Get yourselves to the moon.

1:22:38.170 --> 1:22:43.480
London's only
one small step for a man.

1:22:43.654 --> 1:22:47.005

1:23:22.736 --> 1:23:24.347

He was very popular.
