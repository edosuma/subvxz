00:57.734 --> 00:58.964
There's another one out back!

00:58.979 --> 01:00.713
I threw a garbage can in front of her,

01:00.728 --> 01:03.015
but it only made her more cheerful!

01:05.318 --> 01:07.335
Earl, what happened
out there? Is she gone?

Don't worry. Everything's okay.

North American honey bee.

Oh, no, they got to Earl!

Everybody run.

01:20.734 --> 01:23.155
Or just walk at a moderately fast pace.

No, you see, the American honey

10:21.009 --> 10:23.196
And I will say, seeing you and Tyler

10:23.211 --> 10:25.127
make out in a public
place was kind of a...

10:25.227 --> 10:26.633
- Turn on?
- No.

10:26.648 --> 10:28.208
- Erotic awakening?
- No, it had nothing

10:28.246 --> 10:30.270
to do with you.

10:30.285 --> 10:33.021
It made me realize I haven't
actually laid lips on Randy

10:33.121 --> 10:35.271
since we decided to be
in a relationship again.

10:35.371 --> 10:36.810
So tell him to fly here.

10:36.825 --> 10:38.292
Maybe you can stay at a hotel.

10:38.307 --> 10:39.813
'Cause I may need your bed.

10:39.828 --> 10:41.251
If I put too much pressure on mine,

10:41.266 --> 10:42.630
it flips back into the wall.

10:42.645 --> 10:44.851
Yeah. I do miss him.

10:44.866 --> 10:46.834
And I'm kind of sick of licking my iPad.

10:46.849 --> 10:48.855
Know what I mean?

10:48.870 --> 10:51.571
No. That's how long it's been.

10:54.008 --> 10:55.875
Hey, everybody!

11:00.499 --> 11:03.850
Ah. Baby Barbara loves that.

11:06.855 --> 11:09.175
Oh, we got good news.

11:09.190 --> 11:12.241
And it's not just 'cause the guy
selling the VHS pornos outside

11:12.341 --> 11:15.148
asked if we were sisters.

11:15.163 --> 11:17.064
I have some good news, too.

11:17.079 --> 11:18.999
I'm gonna have sex tonight.

11:19.014 --> 11:21.568
If you know what I mean.

11:21.583 --> 11:23.490
Oh, no.

11:23.505 --> 11:25.605
I lost the pool.

11:26.840 --> 11:28.595
Yeah, I said ten years.

11:28.610 --> 11:32.194
And that's only 'cause
"never" was already taken.

11:32.294 --> 11:35.650
Sophie, I haven't been
able to sell the Yaris.

11:35.750 --> 11:37.800
Looks like we're gonna
have to keep it forever.

11:37.900 --> 11:39.620
I tried, for only, like an hour.

11:39.635 --> 11:41.041
But I tried.

11:41.056 --> 11:43.910
Oh, Oleg. Yeah, well, the good news is,

11:43.925 --> 11:45.975
you don't have to
worry about selling it.

11:46.075 --> 11:47.714
Good, I didn't try.

11:47.729 --> 11:49.730
Ah, 'cause I already sold it!

11:49.745 --> 11:51.051
What?

11:51.066 --> 11:52.933
Oh, no. It's like you've just

11:52.948 --> 11:55.021
taken my manhood from me.

11:55.036 --> 11:57.137
Okay, I can't hold this in any longer.

11:57.152 --> 11:59.239
Who had "never"?

11:59.254 --> 12:01.561
I did.

12:01.576 --> 12:03.577
Hey, Sophie, at least tell me

12:03.592 --> 12:08.016
you sold it to a stud who
will carry on my sexual legacy.

12:08.116 --> 12:10.650
Guess who's the owner of a 2008 Yaris?

12:12.419 --> 12:17.859
Oh, this is tougher to take than
the success of a close friend.

12:17.959 --> 12:21.744
Luckily we have my sexcapades
to lift everyone's spirits.

12:21.844 --> 12:25.681
I'm gonna go stick my
Garfield to the back window.

12:25.781 --> 12:28.121
Oh, that car was magic.

12:28.136 --> 12:31.153
And now, the only tail my
Yaris will ever see again

12:31.353 --> 12:34.373
belongs to a lasagna-eating cat!

12:37.077 --> 12:38.579
What did Randy say? Did you tell him

12:38.594 --> 12:40.948
I'm gonna have a horizontal hoedown?

12:40.963 --> 12:43.103
He was on your email blast.

12:43.118 --> 12:44.838
He's coming tomorrow night.

12:44.853 --> 12:47.013
But don't worry, I'll get
out of the apartment tonight.

12:47.051 --> 12:50.172
I'll find a pick-up stick
ball game or something.

12:50.272 --> 12:54.095
Okay, now who do I give
my $5 to for the pool?

12:54.295 --> 12:57.832
You know what? I think
I'm gonna hold onto it

He can't leave L.A.
'cause of "work stuff."

13:57.091 --> 13:59.842
And now my phone died, so I
can't Google ways to kill him.

14:00.042 --> 14:02.229

He's sort of my boss.

And he doesn't know it yet,
but he's my Secret Santa.

- Is there a bathroom here?

could go with you two.

Kinda.

Max, please don't hit
him in his sex parts,

correctly, is in his winkle.

I'm just saying, what do you expect

16:19.416 --> 16:21.089
from a long-distance relationship?

16:21.104 --> 16:23.368
If he's not moving here
and you're not moving there,

16:23.391 --> 16:25.093
what's the point?

16:25.108 --> 16:27.895
The point is that anything can happen.

16:27.910 --> 16:30.413
And maybe Randy will move
here. And even if he doesn't,

16:30.513 --> 16:32.193
we're gonna have
jetpacks in, like, a year.

16:32.229 --> 16:33.415

16:38.654 --> 16:40.408
- Gimme that phone.
- Max, no!

16:40.423 --> 16:42.704
I wanna remember what it's
like to be touched on the boob.

16:42.739 --> 16:44.759
And not by a guy at LensCrafters

16:44.774 --> 16:47.796
who didn't even work there.

16:47.811 --> 16:49.450
Hello, Randy.

16:49.465 --> 16:51.548
It's the person that,
uh, chose her business

16:51.748 --> 16:54.217
over seeing where things...
what was that, Tyler?

16:54.317 --> 16:57.454
This is exactly how my
parents got divorced.

16:57.554 --> 16:59.473
He wants to talk to you.

17:03.178 --> 17:05.415
- Hey, buddy.
- Hey, Randy, can't hear you.

17:05.515 --> 17:06.948
I'm going through a tunnel.

17:06.963 --> 17:10.204
I wish.

17:10.219 --> 17:12.540
Are you ever gonna move to New York?

17:12.555 --> 17:13.954
Are you ever gonna move to L.A.?

17:13.970 --> 17:15.877
I asked you first.

17:15.892 --> 17:17.626
Max, do you really wanna do this now?

17:17.641 --> 17:19.560
Yeah, now's not great for me.

17:19.576 --> 17:21.983
Yeah, I do. If I'm not moving there,

17:21.998 --> 17:24.414
and you're not moving
here, what's the point?

17:24.614 --> 17:27.421
So, I guess this is it.

17:27.435 --> 17:29.070
I want a boyfriend I'm not afraid of

17:29.085 --> 17:30.939
dropping in the toilet.

17:30.954 --> 17:33.594
- Oh.
- Yeah.

17:33.609 --> 17:35.377
So this is good-bye.

17:35.392 --> 17:37.345
I guess so. Good-bye.

17:40.215 --> 17:42.904
Why?

17:42.919 --> 17:45.206
Why me?

17:45.221 --> 17:48.176
- Should I go?
- No, I will.

17:48.191 --> 17:49.958
Max, you and Randy just broke up.

17:49.973 --> 17:51.679
You can't go.

17:51.694 --> 17:54.796
Unless you really, really want to.

17:54.811 --> 17:56.584
I need to be alone.

17:56.599 --> 17:59.299
Maybe I'll go to a
taping of Carson Daly.

18:03.605 --> 18:05.555
Maybe we should have
done this at my place.

18:05.655 --> 18:07.662
I live with my ex, but she's a lesbian.

18:07.677 --> 18:09.077
Not because of anything I did.

18:09.092 --> 18:10.798
I'm still talking!

18:10.813 --> 18:13.180
Let's let our bodies do it for us.

18:18.254 --> 18:22.009
See, she loves it.

18:22.337 --> 18:23.775
Ah, can you believe
that Oleg still won't

18:23.799 --> 18:25.221
buy the minivan?

18:25.369 --> 18:26.952
Sophie, I'm telling you.

18:26.992 --> 18:29.912
A van with windows? What's the point?

18:31.633 --> 18:34.284
Never had such a hard
time closing the deal.

18:34.484 --> 18:36.657
Yeah, me neither.

18:36.672 --> 18:40.741
Wow, you put out your lunch cheese.

18:42.010 --> 18:43.945
I like this guy for you, Caroline.

18:43.960 --> 18:46.467
You should have sex with him.

18:46.482 --> 18:48.002
Don't love his outfit,

18:48.017 --> 18:49.857
but he's only gonna be
wearing the belt, right?

18:49.895 --> 18:52.873
Did you tell him how long it's been?

18:52.888 --> 18:55.055
I got five bucks riding on this.

18:58.059 --> 19:00.815
Max, you're really upset about Randy.

19:00.830 --> 19:05.168
Usually you high-five me when
we pass a "Rear Entry Only" sign.

19:05.368 --> 19:09.019
After last night, I'm too
upset for sophisticated humor.

19:09.180 --> 19:10.358
I feel like it's my fault.

19:10.373 --> 19:12.989
If you hadn't set me up, none
of this would've happened.

19:13.024 --> 19:15.844
It's not your fault, it's your date...

19:16.288 --> 19:18.647
I wanna say his name is Triscuit.

19:19.105 --> 19:20.219
It was Tyler.

19:20.266 --> 19:21.312
Well, I'm sorry you didn't

19:21.346 --> 19:22.764
get in the bone zone with him.

19:22.864 --> 19:24.853
It's okay. He was a talker.

19:24.868 --> 19:27.341
And if I'm saying that...

19:27.356 --> 19:29.494
And I'm surprised you're
taking this so hard.

19:29.554 --> 19:31.492
You and Randy are more on and off

19:31.551 --> 19:33.714
than a jacket in early fall.

19:34.080 --> 19:35.730
I must be feeling a little better.

19:35.945 --> 19:37.563
"Heavy Load."

19:43.738 --> 19:45.393
Hey, girls.

19:45.832 --> 19:49.412
Guess who just hit a guy
in her brand new minivan?

19:49.913 --> 19:53.049
This thing is so smooth,
we barely even felt it.

19:53.609 --> 19:55.635
Oleg, I thought you said
you'd only get a minivan

19:55.695 --> 19:56.771
over your dead body.

19:56.786 --> 19:59.485
And no offense, but we
all kind of got excited.

19:59.545 --> 20:01.145
Jose failed to mention
that you could fit

20:01.271 --> 20:04.547
a full-size mattress back there.

20:04.607 --> 20:07.013
Not a great salesman.

20:07.073 --> 20:10.113
Let's park this thing so
I can show you the inside.

20:17.065 --> 20:18.896
What the hell, man?

20:21.076 --> 20:23.645
We have lit candles in here.

20:23.660 --> 20:25.680
Han's with a girl?

20:25.695 --> 20:29.103
Oh, ho, that is one magic car.

20:29.521 --> 20:31.186
You know what that means.

20:31.607 --> 20:35.109
Even Han got sex before Caroline.

20:38.383 --> 20:41.162
Who had 32 years for Han in the pool?
