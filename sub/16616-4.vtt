WEBVTT

00:04.922 --> 00:07.674
<i>We now return to</i> Doctor Who Farted.

00:11.303 --> 00:13.430
Doctor, the alien attack has begun!

00:13.514 --> 00:15.891
We've got to return to the 21st century.

00:15.974 --> 00:19.061
Uh, we can't go into the time machine
right now.

00:19.144 --> 00:20.604
But they're going to kill us all!

00:20.687 --> 00:22.898
All right, all right. Just one second.

00:24.024 --> 00:25.859
So, how was your weekend?

00:29.112 --> 00:30.781
Is it your line?

00:30.864 --> 00:32.866
I don't... Uh, no, I don't think so.

00:32.950 --> 00:34.952
-I'm sorry. Whose line is it?
- Cut!

00:36.828 --> 00:38.789
That was Peter's line. Where's Peter?

00:39.414 --> 00:42.543
Sorry, I was in my trailer
eatin' fancy nuts and smokin'.

00:42.626 --> 00:45.003
All right, everybody, take five.

00:45.087 --> 00:49.174
Okay. I'll be in my dressing room,
playing online poker.

00:49.258 --> 00:51.134
That's me asking for help.

00:52.177 --> 00:53.887
Hi, I'm James Woods.

00:53.971 --> 00:55.681
You might know me from
banging your niece

00:55.764 --> 00:57.391
on the pile of your
brother's pool equipment.

00:57.474 --> 00:58.809
Or from <i>Salvador.</i>

00:58.892 --> 01:00.519
But tonight, I'm here to take you

01:00.602 --> 01:03.730
behind the scenes on the set
of <i>Family Guy.</i>

01:03.814 --> 01:07.067
For the first time ever, you'll see
what a typical production week is like

01:07.150 --> 01:09.570
for TV's 11th favorite family.

01:09.653 --> 01:13.448
So, please join me
as we go <i>Inside Family Guy.</i>

01:38.765 --> 01:40.726
Well, it's certainly not easy
being a family

01:40.809 --> 01:43.478
that also happens to star
in a sitcom together.

01:43.562 --> 01:46.064
Especially last year,
when I discovered those naked pictures

01:46.148 --> 01:48.942
of that 18-year-old intern
on Peter's phone.

01:49.026 --> 01:51.195
But he explained that his phone number

01:51.278 --> 01:55.449
was the old number of...
Of her ex-boyfriend, so...

01:55.532 --> 01:58.327
What was it again?
Oh, the cloud. That's right.

01:58.410 --> 02:03.624
So, the photos were on the cloud
and that the cloud pulled the pictures.

02:03.707 --> 02:06.668
I mean, even if the pictures
had not been sent directly to him

02:06.752 --> 02:09.004
and that's why he has them,

02:09.087 --> 02:12.132
and we both called the Apple Store
and they said they can't disprove

02:12.216 --> 02:14.718
that it doesn't happen, so, here we are.

02:14.801 --> 02:16.803
Still married. Still on the show.

02:16.887 --> 02:19.598
And it's happened
five times since then,

02:19.681 --> 02:22.976
and some of the pictures had
both Peter and the girl in them.

02:23.060 --> 02:27.147
Being on this show reminds me
of one of my favorite quotes from <i>Macbeth.</i>

02:27.231 --> 02:29.149
- What's the quote?
-Whoa.

02:29.233 --> 02:32.819
I didn't realize this was a trial.
Objection, Your Honor.

02:32.903 --> 02:35.322
Oh, yeah, it's great. You know,
doing a show with your family.

02:35.405 --> 02:38.325
'Cause what guy doesn't wanna go
to his office and have his family there?

02:38.408 --> 02:41.703
You know, and then you go home after work
and catch up with the family.

02:41.787 --> 02:44.122
And then, uh, next day, same thing.

02:44.623 --> 02:46.291
Just trying to make it to the weekend,

02:46.375 --> 02:49.419
so you can, uh,
spend some time with the family.

02:50.254 --> 02:51.672
Isn't that the dream?

02:52.256 --> 02:53.423
Now, I, I understand

02:53.507 --> 02:55.425
the show was quite different
when it started.

02:55.509 --> 02:59.179
Yeah, in the original pilot,
I was actually the star.

02:59.263 --> 03:01.890
It was called Chris Griffin, Teen Doctor.

03:02.432 --> 03:05.143
- Sir, I'm afraid I've got some bad news.

03:06.103 --> 03:08.897
Well, it can't be any worse
than what's in here.

03:11.066 --> 03:13.861
I ad-libbed that line.
I wasn't even supposed to talk.

03:13.944 --> 03:15.028
What they didn't know is that

03:15.112 --> 03:18.198
I'd been privately doing jokes
about the newspaper for years.

03:18.282 --> 03:20.450
But, you know, it's not just
the Griffins who work hard

03:20.534 --> 03:22.536
to make <i>Family Guy</i> what it is.

03:22.619 --> 03:23.996
Here in the props department,

03:24.079 --> 03:26.415
some sweaty guy is working
on the Petercopter.

03:26.498 --> 03:29.042
That's right. You know,
a lot of people don't realize

03:29.126 --> 03:32.421
SEAL Team Six actually
completed their mission in this puppy.

03:33.839 --> 03:37.384
Oh, cool! <i>Family Guy!</i>
Over here! I'm down here!

03:39.178 --> 03:40.470
Knock-knock.

03:40.554 --> 03:41.805
- Yeah?
- Hi, Stewie.

03:41.889 --> 03:44.433
I was just showing the viewers
around <i>Family Guy,</i>

03:44.516 --> 03:47.603
and we thought we'd drop in
and talk to you about the show.

03:47.686 --> 03:48.812
You wanna talk about the show?

03:48.896 --> 03:50.981
I'll talk about the show. The show sucks.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.442
The only reason I stay here
is to maintain my profile

03:53.525 --> 03:56.737
for my start-up business,
Discreetcrepe.com.

03:56.820 --> 03:59.573
Hi, are you a straight adult male
who likes to eat crepes

03:59.656 --> 04:02.659
without people making unwanted
assumptions about your private life?

04:02.743 --> 04:04.494
Go to Discreetcrepe.com.

04:04.578 --> 04:06.788
Place your order, and within 30 minutes...

04:09.750 --> 04:13.086
Very masculine pizza delivery
for Stewie Griffin.

04:13.170 --> 04:14.171
Oh, thank you.

04:14.963 --> 04:18.467
Mmm, strawberry-banana Nutella
with raspberry drizzle.

04:18.550 --> 04:22.346
Now I just need a guy's butt to eat
this off of, and I got myself a night.

04:22.429 --> 04:25.974
But of course, every episode
of <i>Family Guy</i> starts with the writing.

04:26.058 --> 04:29.186
And here we are,
the <i>Family Guy</i> writers' room.

04:31.063 --> 04:34.733
Where the writers are hard at work
with the show's talented cast.

04:34.816 --> 04:36.944
Look don't get me wrong, guys,
I, I think it's hilarious,

04:37.027 --> 04:40.656
and I totally get that the sex thing
is what made me popular, but...

04:40.739 --> 04:44.535
Would it kill us to just once
tell a joke that brings glory to God?

04:44.618 --> 04:46.662
Eight years ago, Glenn opened a restaurant

04:46.745 --> 04:49.206
where he was spying on ladies
peeing in the bathroom.

04:49.289 --> 04:51.708
As part of the class-action settlement,

04:51.792 --> 04:54.962
he entered rehab
and that's where he found Jesus.

04:55.045 --> 04:58.507
The restaurant was called Sprinklers.
That should have been a tip off.

04:58.590 --> 05:01.677
He still runs Dumpies,
but I'm pretty sure that one's legit.

05:02.386 --> 05:03.804
<i>As the star of the show,</i>

05:03.887 --> 05:06.640
<i>Peter likes to stay involved</i>
<i>in the writing process.</i>

05:07.558 --> 05:10.602
All right, butthorns.
Which one of you idiots wrote this script?

05:10.686 --> 05:12.104
Uh, I did.

05:12.187 --> 05:14.147
Oh, what'd you write it, like,
on a computer?

05:14.231 --> 05:15.232
Yeah.

05:15.315 --> 05:18.068
- So, you know a lot about computers?
-Yeah.

05:18.151 --> 05:20.487
Can you show me how to turn off
the flashlight on my phone?

05:20.571 --> 05:22.322
- Don't touch my phone!

05:22.406 --> 05:25.117
And another thing,
I read this piece of garbage script.

05:25.200 --> 05:27.494
It's only one page.
That's never gonna cut it!

05:27.578 --> 05:31.456
Uh, that's just the cover.
You can turn the page, like this.

05:31.540 --> 05:34.293
Well, why are you hiding all these pages
behind the first page?

05:34.376 --> 05:35.377
What's wrong with them?

05:35.460 --> 05:38.755
Stand by your work or get out!
Now, spit in each other's mouths.

05:40.007 --> 05:42.926
You know I'm only tough on you
'cause I hate you, right?

05:43.260 --> 05:46.388
Yeah, over the years,
Peter's become just a total nightmare.

05:46.471 --> 05:48.015
I mean, you know, he's not Jim Belushi.

05:48.098 --> 05:52.186
He's not peeing in Snapple bottles on set,
which is, like, a totally real thing.

05:52.269 --> 05:53.854
But he's pretty bad.

05:53.937 --> 05:56.523
Dad refuses to interact
with any actors on set.

05:56.607 --> 06:00.235
He'll only rehearse with helium balloons
with crudely drawn faces on them.

06:00.611 --> 06:02.112
I'm sorry, Meg, but you're grounded.

06:02.196 --> 06:04.990
<i>But, Dad, the prom is tonight. Over.</i>

06:05.073 --> 06:07.159
- <i>You heard your father, Meg. Over.</i>

06:09.494 --> 06:11.830
<i>Peter, are you ready to hit</i>
<i>The Drunken Clam?</i>

06:11.914 --> 06:12.915
<i>- Over.</i>

06:12.998 --> 06:16.210
It's difficult having to give up
my chair for the balloon.

06:16.293 --> 06:19.004
Well, that's the business we call show.

06:19.087 --> 06:20.422
Excuse me, Joe.

06:21.423 --> 06:24.885
The fat man's behavior has been
deteriorating for quite some time,

06:24.968 --> 06:27.221
and I think someone may have placed

06:27.304 --> 06:29.890
an anonymous phone call
to the network about it.

06:44.655 --> 06:47.449
Word around the stage is,
they've decided to finally fire Peter

06:47.533 --> 06:49.076
and replace him with another actor.

06:49.159 --> 06:50.744
And this time, it's permanent.

06:50.827 --> 06:53.121
Not like when we killed off
Brian for a few episodes,

06:53.205 --> 06:55.958
so he could shoot that crappy movie.
What was it?

06:56.041 --> 06:57.543
It was a remake of <i>Old Yeller,</i>

06:57.626 --> 07:00.128
where the dog gets the drop on him
and kills him first.

07:01.004 --> 07:02.130
I'm sorry.

07:02.923 --> 07:04.842
No. I'm sorry.

07:09.054 --> 07:12.599
They miscalculated the number of dogs
who buy movie tickets.

07:12.683 --> 07:14.268
It's actually pretty awkward.

07:14.351 --> 07:16.520
I mean, Dad's the only one
in the whole production

07:16.603 --> 07:18.146
who doesn't know he's being fired.

07:18.230 --> 07:20.774
But he'll find out tomorrow
at the table read.

07:24.862 --> 07:28.156
This is how we did that.
Bet you didn't know.

07:37.541 --> 07:40.752
The table read is where
the <i>Family Guy</i> cast reads aloud

07:40.836 --> 07:44.298
that week's script, to see how
the story and the jokes are working.

07:44.381 --> 07:47.593
And where Peter will learn
he's being written off the show.

07:48.177 --> 07:51.680
Okay, everybody, welcome to the table read
for this week's episode

07:51.763 --> 07:54.474
entitled, "Peter Dies,
We're Really Serious,

07:54.558 --> 07:57.227
"No Joke,
He's Dead and Never Coming Back."

07:57.311 --> 07:59.146
Oh, and there's other pages,
you gotta turn them.

07:59.229 --> 08:00.522
Here, let me show you.

08:00.606 --> 08:05.152
Griffin's living room.
Day. Brian, Meg and Chris watch TV.

08:05.235 --> 08:06.778
"Lois enters upset."

08:06.862 --> 08:10.616
"You guys, I have terrible news.
Your father is dead.

08:10.699 --> 08:13.160
"He was shot in the head
while killing himself.

08:13.243 --> 08:16.580
"I suppose he had his demons
and his enemies."

08:16.663 --> 08:18.665
Wait, I'm... I'm what?

08:18.749 --> 08:22.002
Oh, oh, I know. Stewie's gonna fire up
his time machine and undo this.

08:22.085 --> 08:24.463
- "Stewie enters."
-"Brian, bad news.

08:24.546 --> 08:28.425
"My time machine got a virus that causes
Dad to die again if it's ever used."

08:28.926 --> 08:30.052
Oh, well, you know what,

08:30.135 --> 08:33.889
- I bet this is all Chris' dream.
-"Wow, I am wide awake."

08:34.306 --> 08:36.183
Okay, but there's no way this is real.

08:36.266 --> 08:38.018
They'd have to bring in someone
to replace me.

08:38.101 --> 08:42.022
"Uncle Ricky, played by
sitcom buzzard David Spade, enters."

08:42.105 --> 08:45.067
-"Hi, everybody."
- "Uncle Ricky!"

08:45.150 --> 08:48.654
"Hey, guys. The time period called,
they want an object back."

08:50.572 --> 08:53.116
"Aw, do we have to go to Dad's funeral?

08:53.200 --> 08:55.619
"Let's just play with Uncle Ricky
instead."

08:55.786 --> 08:58.789
"The family cheers.
They do not miss Peter."

09:03.210 --> 09:04.628
I'm sorry, Peter,

09:04.711 --> 09:07.631
but the production just can't deal
with all your nonsense anymore.

09:07.756 --> 09:10.092
- We're letting you go.
- Oh, please don't do this.

09:10.175 --> 09:12.302
I'm begging you,
just give me one more chance.

09:12.386 --> 09:14.721
Okay, fine.

09:14.805 --> 09:18.016
- All right. That's it. You're fired!

09:18.100 --> 09:19.977
And you guys are all okay with this?

09:20.102 --> 09:21.728
I'm sorry, sweetheart.

09:21.812 --> 09:25.566
This is painful for all of us,
but we just don't see another option.

09:25.649 --> 09:29.027
Yeah, Peter, we love you
and you're still part of the family.

09:29.111 --> 09:30.529
Just not part of the show.

09:30.654 --> 09:33.407
Look, I don't know who brought this on,
but maybe it's for the best.

09:33.490 --> 09:37.619
All right, fine! You bastards can fire me,
but at least I'm leaving with my dignity.

09:55.053 --> 09:57.723
Have a good life, Mr. G.
Your penis is out.

10:00.726 --> 10:03.145
Welcome back to <i>Inside Family Guy.</i>

10:03.228 --> 10:07.024
I'm your host and angel investor
to The Fappening, James Woods.

10:07.107 --> 10:11.111
Boy, we picked quite a week to document
the production of a <i>Family Guy</i> episode.

10:11.195 --> 10:14.114
Yesterday, Peter Griffin
was fired from the show

10:14.198 --> 10:16.450
and replaced by David Spade.

10:16.533 --> 10:20.287
Given the surprising development,
we decided to follow Peter

10:20.370 --> 10:23.749
and see if our cameras
could capture his story as well.

10:24.291 --> 10:27.628
<i>We caught up with Peter at Hollywood's</i>
<i>legendary Chateau Marmont Hotel,</i>

10:27.711 --> 10:31.632
<i>where I once engaged in the consensual</i>
<i>murder of an underage prostitute.</i>

10:32.090 --> 10:34.885
So, what's your plan? Are you going
to be staying here for a while?

10:34.968 --> 10:37.137
Yeah, well, I figured if my family
doesn't want me on the show,

10:37.221 --> 10:39.473
there's no reason
I should keep living with them.

10:39.556 --> 10:43.519
I... I mean, there's no hard feelings.
Um, I just feel like this is best for me

10:43.602 --> 10:45.896
and this is best for those cancerous
dicks.

10:45.979 --> 10:47.981
And what's next
for Peter Griffin?

10:48.065 --> 10:50.317
Well, starting tomorrow,
I'm getting back out there.

10:50.400 --> 10:53.987
I already got an audition to be
the caring dad for a Cheerios commercial.

10:54.738 --> 10:56.490
- Hey, Dad?
- Yeah, bud?

10:56.573 --> 10:59.535
When you were a kid, what did you
want to be when you grew up?

10:59.618 --> 11:01.411
Well, I wanted to be a rockstar.

11:01.495 --> 11:03.038
Why didn't you become one?

11:03.121 --> 11:04.331
'Cause of you, bud.

11:04.414 --> 11:06.792
I smiled at one girl in a cell phone store

11:06.875 --> 11:09.837
and now, here I am,
stuck eating cereal for dinner with a kid.

11:09.920 --> 11:12.840
You'll always be a rockstar to me, Dad.

11:12.923 --> 11:14.258
You ruined my life.

11:16.718 --> 11:18.095
I'm going to bed.

11:23.892 --> 11:26.645
Wednesdays are rehearsal days
here at <i>Family Guy.</i>

11:26.728 --> 11:30.566
And the first rehearsal with David Spade
appears to be going very well.

11:33.360 --> 11:36.947
"Uncle Ricky, what are all these
strippers doing in our house?"

11:37.406 --> 11:39.032
"Uh, each other."

11:39.992 --> 11:41.243
Hmm?

11:43.287 --> 11:46.874
Oh, my God! I'm sorry, I just...

11:46.957 --> 11:51.461
Did you see the way he smirked?
He's like a naughty 53-year-old boy!

11:51.837 --> 11:54.131
Who is this guy?
I'm not familiar with him.

11:54.214 --> 11:57.676
- That's David Spade from <i>Just Shoot Me.</i>
- I don't know that one.

11:57.759 --> 12:00.846
He was in <i>Grown Ups, Joe Dirt,</i>
<i>Saturday Night Live.</i>

12:00.929 --> 12:01.930
- Saturday what how?

12:02.014 --> 12:04.224
He was also in some movie
called <i>Senseless.</i>

12:04.308 --> 12:07.936
With Marlon Wayans? Oh, yeah!
He played Scott Thorpe!

12:08.020 --> 12:11.607
- Donna, I'm here with Scott Thorpe!

12:11.690 --> 12:13.400
That's right! From <i>Senseless.</i>

12:17.654 --> 12:19.740
Yeah, I gotta be honest.
I'm having a blast.

12:19.823 --> 12:22.075
You know, now that
I'm not tied down by the show,

12:22.159 --> 12:24.912
it's given me more time
to pursue my true passion.

12:24.995 --> 12:28.457
Weaving sexually explicit tapestries
featuring the Minions.

12:33.670 --> 12:36.089
Did you have any questions
about the artist?

12:40.427 --> 12:43.847
Thursdays at <i>Family Guy</i> are reserved
for shooting all those flashbacks

12:43.931 --> 12:46.016
and cutaway gags we love so much.

12:46.099 --> 12:47.518
And what most people don't know

12:47.601 --> 12:50.979
is that all these gags
are directed by James Cameron.

12:51.563 --> 12:53.440
What's that? I'm sorry.

12:53.524 --> 12:55.484
Apparently, I misread the cue card.

12:55.567 --> 12:58.529
They're directed by James, the cameraman.

12:58.612 --> 13:00.405
Tell us, how did you get the gig?

13:00.489 --> 13:03.575
I sold Vicodin to some of the producers.

13:03.659 --> 13:05.994
What a wonderful Hollywood story.

13:06.078 --> 13:09.623
You know, many viewers think
our cutaways are just whipped together,

13:09.706 --> 13:13.710
but they actually go through
a rigorous testing process before filming.

13:14.294 --> 13:17.631
This is the planet Jew-piter
and he could say,

13:17.714 --> 13:20.133
"Next year is my star mitzvah."

13:21.593 --> 13:24.304
They love it. Tell the director.
Where is he?

13:24.388 --> 13:28.767
It says don't take it with alcohol.
But you should take it with alcohol.

13:28.851 --> 13:32.521
Yeah, duh. I also need a couple
for the girl I'm babysitting.

13:32.604 --> 13:36.650
<i>Meanwhile, David Spade</i>
<i>is making lots of friends on set.</i>

13:36.733 --> 13:38.777
Yeah, I'll definitely talk to the writers.

13:38.861 --> 13:41.905
I agree, there's a lot about
your character that's still untapped.

13:41.989 --> 13:46.994
Okay, thank you. Because like, yes,
I'm greased up and, yes, I'm deaf.

13:47.077 --> 13:49.246
- But what else am I?
- Totally.

13:49.329 --> 13:51.498
- Thanks, man.
- Okay, we're ready for you.

13:51.582 --> 13:53.542
I'll be right there.

13:54.209 --> 13:55.669
Who's the new kid?

13:55.752 --> 13:57.588
Hot chihuahua!

13:57.963 --> 14:01.341
Unfortunately, things aren't going
quite so well for Peter.

14:03.677 --> 14:08.223
Yeah, it's an '09, fully loaded,
extra cool AC. Great.

14:08.307 --> 14:10.976
I just made 500 flippin' a Honda.

14:11.059 --> 14:13.770
All I did was Armor All the dash. Boom.

14:17.774 --> 14:18.984
Hey, any mail for me?

14:19.067 --> 14:22.196
Yes, your death threats to Grimace
have all been returned.

14:22.279 --> 14:24.656
Well, has the Shamrock Shake
period been extended?

14:24.740 --> 14:26.241
I believe that's still seasonal,

14:26.325 --> 14:28.744
but while I have you,
your bill remains unpaid.

14:28.827 --> 14:31.038
And we saw you selling our robes on eBay.

14:31.121 --> 14:33.415
I'm afraid we're evicting you
from the hotel.

14:33.498 --> 14:35.042
What's your home address?

14:35.125 --> 14:37.920
I'm sorry, sir. Now, do you
wanna leave the regular way

14:38.003 --> 14:40.130
or do you want our Uncle Phil
to throw you out?

14:40.214 --> 14:42.466
I think you know what I want.

14:53.352 --> 14:55.729
Door was unlocked. I'm sure that's fine.

14:57.814 --> 15:00.734
Well, this seems like
a really cheery place, and...

15:00.817 --> 15:02.653
Looks like some guy
named Brooks was here

15:02.736 --> 15:04.947
and I think this is gonna
work out just great.

15:05.030 --> 15:07.366
You don't miss your show
or your family at all?

15:07.449 --> 15:09.159
Of course I miss my family.

15:09.243 --> 15:12.579
But everything comes to an end eventually,
and you just...

15:12.663 --> 15:14.331
You just gotta keep moving forward.

15:14.414 --> 15:17.125
- Are you gonna be all right?
- Oh, yeah, yeah.

15:17.209 --> 15:19.545
In fact, I was just about to melt
some cheese on chips

15:19.628 --> 15:22.381
if you wanna stay for a sad,
single guy dinner.

15:22.464 --> 15:23.841
You're going oven or microwave?

15:23.924 --> 15:26.844
Uh, microwave. I don't know
how to turn on the oven.

15:28.095 --> 15:30.597
Those, uh, chips are gonna
be chewy, Peter.

15:37.604 --> 15:40.315
Friday night is tape night here
at <i>Family Guy.</i>

15:40.399 --> 15:44.278
But tonight, they'll be filming
the show without Peter Griffin.

15:44.361 --> 15:48.240
I have to admit, it's a little strange
taping a show without Peter.

15:48.323 --> 15:50.117
It, it just doesn't feel right.

15:50.200 --> 15:52.786
I'm especially going to miss
the fat man's bit with the audience,

15:52.870 --> 15:55.414
where he fires the T-shirt cannon
at his own head.

15:55.497 --> 15:58.166
You know he once tried to hold up
a store with that thing?

15:59.376 --> 16:01.295
All right, everybody on the floor.
Empty the register!

16:01.378 --> 16:04.214
- Please don't do this.
- Oh, yeah? You wanna be a hero?

16:04.298 --> 16:05.924
Here's what happens to heroes.

16:06.341 --> 16:07.968
Anybody else want to be a hero?

16:08.051 --> 16:10.554
Ooh, me, me, me! Over here! Over here!

16:10.888 --> 16:13.015
And with regard to Peter's replacement,

16:13.098 --> 16:15.642
well, as his parents
and previous co-stars have learned,

16:15.726 --> 16:19.062
a little of David Spade goes a long way.

16:19.146 --> 16:22.232
David, the line is,
"What's for dinner?" Go again.

16:23.400 --> 16:25.777
What's for dinner? Hmm?

16:26.403 --> 16:28.822
Okay, we can trim that in editing.

16:28.906 --> 16:30.574
He's getting on people's nerves.

16:30.657 --> 16:33.660
I mean, there's only so many jars
I can open for one man.

16:33.744 --> 16:35.829
Lois, I want pickles!

16:35.913 --> 16:37.164
Coming!

16:37.247 --> 16:39.041
He has tiny hands.

16:39.124 --> 16:42.336
But when one of my rings went
down the drain, he got it right out.

16:42.419 --> 16:45.797
<i>Meanwhile, Peter has</i>
<i>wound up here at the Chinese theater</i>

16:45.881 --> 16:48.926
<i>where panhandlers dress up</i>
<i>like iconic movie characters</i>

16:49.009 --> 16:50.761
<i>and charge tourists for photos.</i>

16:50.844 --> 16:53.138
<i>It's even seedier than it sounds.</i>

16:53.222 --> 16:56.433
Step right up, get your picture taken
with beloved comic icon,

16:56.517 --> 16:58.268
Little Lotta, just two dollars.

16:58.352 --> 17:00.395
- Who are you?
- Uh, Little Lotta.

17:00.479 --> 17:03.607
- She was friends with Audrey and Dot.
- Never heard of her.

17:10.739 --> 17:12.199
That's it. Screw this.

17:12.282 --> 17:15.452
I am taking back my TV show
and my family.

17:17.621 --> 17:19.164
Ah, we just missed her.

17:23.544 --> 17:26.296
Hey, Smitty. I'm here to get my show back.

17:26.380 --> 17:28.715
I'm sorry, Mr. Griffin,
but we have specific orders

17:28.799 --> 17:31.176
- not to let you onto the lot.
- Seriously?

17:31.260 --> 17:34.429
Well, I suppose you could come inside
if you had an idea for a show

17:34.513 --> 17:36.682
the heads of the network wanted to buy.

17:37.474 --> 17:39.226
<i>Bumbler with a Tumblr.</i>

17:39.309 --> 17:42.271
So, you see, he's got a Tumblr account
and he's clumsy.

17:42.354 --> 17:44.565
We really like the idea
that the words rhyme.

17:44.648 --> 17:47.234
Absolutely, but just a thought.

17:47.317 --> 17:49.444
What if he doesn't bumble?

17:49.987 --> 17:52.281
Um, I... I guess so.

17:52.364 --> 17:55.033
And are we married to the Tumblr account?

17:55.117 --> 17:58.245
The bought the pitch,
but, um, after a series of network notes,

17:58.328 --> 18:01.999
Bumbler with a Tumblr eventually
aired as <i>Bamblr with a Famblr.</i>

18:02.082 --> 18:05.085
Which made sense to nobody
and is now in its third season.

18:05.169 --> 18:07.337
It did also get me on the lot.

18:07.421 --> 18:09.256
All right, stop the show!

18:09.339 --> 18:11.550
- Dad!
- That's right, I'm back.

18:11.633 --> 18:13.093
And, Chris, I brought you a T-shirt

18:13.177 --> 18:15.387
of Kermit the Frog acting like
a hip-hop guy.

18:15.470 --> 18:16.930
That's so dope.

18:17.014 --> 18:18.473
Don't put it on. It'll fall apart.

18:18.557 --> 18:21.393
But listen, everybody,
I realized something.

18:21.476 --> 18:23.228
I've been a real jerk.

18:23.312 --> 18:25.439
To you guys and to all the union fat asses

18:25.522 --> 18:27.649
that I assume do something
to keep this thing going.

18:27.733 --> 18:30.986
The fact is, I got too big
for my britches.

18:31.069 --> 18:34.239
But I know now
that I'm nothing without all of you.

18:34.323 --> 18:36.033
Oh, that's nice of you to say.

18:36.116 --> 18:38.285
Thank you, Stewie, who I can understand.

18:38.368 --> 18:41.830
And if you guys can find it
in your hearts to take me back,

18:41.914 --> 18:45.417
well, then I promise that every day,
I'll prove to you how much the show

18:45.501 --> 18:47.961
and how much my family means to me.

18:48.045 --> 18:51.048
Aw, Peter. Of course we'll take you back.

18:52.090 --> 18:54.801
- Oh, welcome back, buddy.
- We missed you so much.

18:54.885 --> 18:58.430
My online poker problem
is burning like a wildfire.

18:59.223 --> 19:01.433
- Well, there's only one problem.
- What's that?

19:01.517 --> 19:03.519
What are we gonna do about David Spade?

19:03.602 --> 19:05.395
Don't worry, I already took care of that.

19:05.479 --> 19:07.523
I got Sofia Vergara deported.

19:07.981 --> 19:10.651
- Hey, everyone, cuchi, cuchi.

19:10.734 --> 19:12.069
I'm your mother now.

19:12.611 --> 19:14.446
So, all right. Let's do a show.

19:14.530 --> 19:16.406
Oh, wait, if my character's still alive,

19:16.490 --> 19:18.200
that means we don't have
a script to shoot.

19:18.283 --> 19:19.576
Oh, look at this.

19:19.660 --> 19:23.121
We just happen to have
a whole extra script right here.

19:23.205 --> 19:24.665
"Pete, Don't Fail Me Now."

19:24.748 --> 19:27.251
Sounds like I might be a teacher.

19:27.835 --> 19:29.336
Oh, I have a goatee up till

19:29.419 --> 19:31.588
the first commercial, and then
I'm a teacher.

19:31.755 --> 19:33.674
Every week Peter becomes a diva.

19:33.757 --> 19:36.677
So, the writers
write a fake script killing him off.

19:36.760 --> 19:39.179
He storms out, then by Friday's taping

19:39.263 --> 19:42.349
comes crawling back
and we shoot the real script.

19:42.432 --> 19:43.934
Of course, he always forgets by Monday

19:44.017 --> 19:46.311
and then he becomes
a pain in the ass again.

19:46.395 --> 19:48.689
Does it bother me
that he does this every week?

19:48.772 --> 19:51.608
Uh, why don't you ask my Camaro?

19:53.527 --> 19:55.988
<i>So, I guess this actually</i>
<i>was a very typical week</i>

19:56.071 --> 19:57.656
<i>on the set of</i> Family Guy.

19:57.739 --> 19:58.991
<i>Thanks for joining us.</i>

19:59.074 --> 20:00.367
<i>I'm James Woods,</i>

20:00.450 --> 20:04.162
<i>and we'll close tonight with a supercut</i>
<i>of every time in the show's history</i>

20:04.246 --> 20:06.832
<i>that Peter got hit in the crotch</i>
<i>with a bag of nickels.</i>

20:07.332 --> 20:08.375
Ow!

20:10.711 --> 20:11.712
Damn it!

20:11.795 --> 20:12.796
Oh!

20:14.339 --> 20:15.340
Why?

20:15.424 --> 20:17.718
Hey, Lois, you should do that thing
that I like...

20:17.801 --> 20:19.887
Hey, kids, have you seen my wallet?
Oh, nickels!

20:20.470 --> 20:21.805
Son of a bitch!

20:21.889 --> 20:23.891
<i>Uh, ladies and gentlemen,</i>
<i>we have now reached our cruising...</i>

20:23.974 --> 20:25.225
<i>- Ah, damn it!</i>

20:25.309 --> 20:28.437
Boy, can't beat this weather...
Who is that kid?

20:30.105 --> 20:32.316
Hello? Uh, hang on, I'll check.

20:32.399 --> 20:34.902
Phone call for a bag of nickels...

20:36.737 --> 20:39.531
At least he was alone.
They usually travel in threes.

20:39.615 --> 20:40.991
Ow! Crap!

20:43.327 --> 20:44.328
Ah, nickels!

20:48.081 --> 20:49.082
Oh, damn it!

20:49.166 --> 20:51.168
Do you think I'm ever gonna be
able to have...

20:53.253 --> 20:54.254
Ow!
