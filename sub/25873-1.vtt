WEBVTT

00:04.569 --> 00:06.136
Welcome to the Jefferson High

00:06.180 --> 00:09.531
Aquatics Gymnasium
for the 2004 Girls Finals

00:09.574 --> 00:13.230
in the 4x100 meter
freestyle relay.

00:13.274 --> 00:14.840
The early favorites today

00:14.884 --> 00:16.929
have to be the team
of Jefferson High,

00:16.973 --> 00:19.628
with the twin sisters
Callie and Elizabeth Abbott.

00:22.631 --> 00:24.546
Take your mark.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.722
They're off.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.680
Gets out to the early lead
with Jefferson

00:28.724 --> 00:31.074
following close behind
in lane four.

00:31.118 --> 00:33.642
They're trailed by Willow Park
in lane three.

00:33.685 --> 00:35.992
But with all of
these swimmers here today,

00:36.036 --> 00:38.690
it's really anyone's race.

00:38.734 --> 00:40.083
All right, they make it to

00:40.127 --> 00:41.737
the first change at the diver.

00:41.780 --> 00:43.260
Still in the lead,

00:43.304 --> 00:46.524
but Jefferson
is right on their heels.

00:46.568 --> 00:49.353
Elizabeth Abbott is in the pool,
and she is something else.

00:49.397 --> 00:51.790
Oh, my!

00:51.834 --> 00:55.620
She just put in an incredible
time swimming the second leg.

00:55.664 --> 00:59.146
The dynamic twin-sister duo
of Callie and Elizabeth Abbott

00:59.189 --> 01:01.235
are a force to be reckoned with.

01:04.846 --> 01:07.284
It's gonna be
up to Callie Abbott to see

01:07.328 --> 01:10.244
if she can bring it home
for Jefferson High.

01:10.287 --> 01:12.507
She's in the pool.

01:12.550 --> 01:14.726
She's coming up.

01:14.770 --> 01:18.600
In the lead, but Jefferson
is pulling in close.

01:18.643 --> 01:20.384
It's neck and neck.

01:20.428 --> 01:22.995
Callie Abbott, she's coming!

01:23.039 --> 01:27.783
Oh, my! Callie Abbott!
Jefferson High!

01:27.826 --> 01:31.091
They are your new champions!

01:40.317 --> 01:42.754
You owe me.
Put it on my tab.

01:42.798 --> 01:45.017
When I'm selling mansions,
I'll buy you whatever you want.

01:45.061 --> 01:46.454
Yeah, right!
I'm not waiting that long.

01:46.497 --> 01:47.716
Well, that chemistry test
I aced for you

01:47.759 --> 01:49.152
more than makes up for it.

01:49.196 --> 01:50.719
No way.
That was a no-brainer for you.

01:50.762 --> 01:52.808
It's the result, not the effort.

01:52.851 --> 01:56.551
There you are!
Yay!

01:56.594 --> 01:59.249
I am so proud of you two.

01:59.293 --> 02:01.947
Honestly, I don't know
where you get it.

02:01.991 --> 02:03.993
Your mom would have drowned
in a kiddie pool.

02:06.256 --> 02:09.824
You'd better not. You said I owe you.

02:09.868 --> 02:12.349
I'm smelling
swim scholarships...

02:12.393 --> 02:14.917
Don't you dare! Callie,
come back here.

02:14.960 --> 02:16.571
I'm Elizabeth.
I'll be right back.

02:16.614 --> 02:18.399
You're not fooling me, Callie!

02:18.442 --> 02:19.791
Hi.
What is she doing?

02:19.835 --> 02:21.184
Hi.

02:21.228 --> 02:22.403
Oh, my God.
What's going on?

02:22.446 --> 02:24.144
This is so embarrassing.

02:24.187 --> 02:26.058
That's Ricky Davis.
That's the guy I told you about.

02:26.102 --> 02:27.930
Oh, no,
she's still talking to him.

02:27.973 --> 02:30.324
She's at it again,
pretending to be me.

02:30.367 --> 02:32.108
Ohh!

02:32.152 --> 02:34.980
Now you owe me big time.

02:35.024 --> 02:36.808
What'd you do?

02:36.852 --> 02:39.463
Aunt Rose, Lizzie's gonna be
needing a prom dress.

02:39.507 --> 02:41.422
I hate you.

02:41.465 --> 02:44.033
Oh, my God, I love you!

02:46.688 --> 02:49.038
You'd let me go to prom
with Ricky Davis.

02:50.518 --> 02:52.389
So exciting.

03:09.624 --> 03:12.453
Play some samba. Okay.

03:21.026 --> 03:24.856
I spy mac and cheese!
Yum!

03:24.900 --> 03:27.816
Aunt Rose's specialty.
You are such a good mom.

03:27.859 --> 03:29.296
Don't call me Mom.

03:29.339 --> 03:31.863
Hi,
Aunt Lizzie! Hey, munchkin!

03:31.907 --> 03:34.605
So tell me, what's on
your social calendar tonight?

03:34.649 --> 03:38.087
Ugh, Hawks game with a client.
They're playing the Cavs.

03:38.130 --> 03:40.872
Oh, LeBron?
Don't sound so thrilled.

03:40.916 --> 03:42.352
What I wouldn't give
for a night at home

03:42.396 --> 03:44.267
and a bowl
of that mac and cheese.

03:44.311 --> 03:45.964
Hey, I will trade you the kids

03:46.008 --> 03:47.923
and all the mac and cheese
you can eat for those seats.

03:47.966 --> 03:50.012
Make it Callie's meatloaf
for Braves tickets.

03:50.055 --> 03:51.318
Oh, Braves ain't
making the playoffs.

03:51.361 --> 03:52.754
Besides, my wife's meatloaf

03:52.797 --> 03:54.451
is pushing
serious gourmet territory.

03:54.495 --> 03:56.105
Hmm, how about
a Sunday-night dinner?

03:56.148 --> 03:57.846
I could use a little normal.

03:57.889 --> 03:59.500
Sounds like a deal to me,
but if you want normal,

03:59.543 --> 04:00.849
I'll give you
Ruby's ballet practice,

04:00.892 --> 04:02.329
a cub scout meet,

04:02.372 --> 04:04.026
and, uh, some window cleaning
on Saturday.

04:08.683 --> 04:11.251
Grady seems fine. Where are my kids?

04:11.294 --> 04:13.296
It's an act. He's not happy
about this weekend.

04:13.340 --> 04:14.689
Hmm.

04:14.732 --> 04:16.473
So did you go out
with Jackson yet?

04:16.517 --> 04:18.910
We'll talk about it
when I get up there.

04:18.954 --> 04:20.695
I'm bringing a case of wine.

04:20.738 --> 04:22.827
I want French labels
I can't pronounce.

04:22.871 --> 04:24.916
See you tomorrow!

04:24.960 --> 04:27.136
I found the whole zoo.

04:27.179 --> 04:30.966
I got my monkey.
I got my little pudding.

04:49.898 --> 04:52.640
Good morning, Elizabeth.
Be careful in there.

04:52.683 --> 04:54.946
Mr. Finch
is having a meltdown.

04:56.948 --> 04:58.515
Hey, Lizzie.

05:05.174 --> 05:09.526
Jackson, my God,
redecorating?

05:09.570 --> 05:12.486
Dylan Finch,
my new interior designer.

05:12.529 --> 05:14.226
What the hell's his problem?

05:14.270 --> 05:16.185
He wants
his money back.

05:16.228 --> 05:18.405
I feel like I've said it
hundreds of times.

05:18.448 --> 05:20.058
It's a long-term investment.

05:20.102 --> 05:22.452
Don't put in more than
you can afford to risk.

05:22.496 --> 05:24.062
It's just...
It's starting to get to me.

05:24.106 --> 05:25.760
Let's just give him some time.

05:25.803 --> 05:27.849
Hopefully, he'll calm down.

05:27.892 --> 05:30.417
Oh, 2,000 calories
in a paper cup.

05:30.460 --> 05:32.375
Thank you.

05:32.419 --> 05:35.335
Janice, uh, we got it.
Thank you so much.

05:35.378 --> 05:37.815
Wait, so, uh,
what are you doing here?

05:37.859 --> 05:39.382
Oh, did you miss me already?

05:39.426 --> 05:41.036
I don't know.
You haven't left yet.

05:41.079 --> 05:42.559
Ouch.

05:42.603 --> 05:45.170
Well, you better get a good look

05:45.214 --> 05:47.521
because you're gonna
miss me lots.

05:47.564 --> 05:49.871
Well, in that case, madame,

05:49.914 --> 05:51.568
I better take you
to Les Bouquet for lunch.

05:53.222 --> 05:55.703
Wish I could,
but I have to get on the road.

05:55.746 --> 05:58.227
If I get stuck in traffic,
my sister'll kill me.

05:58.270 --> 06:00.664
She's been planning
this trip forever.

06:00.708 --> 06:02.710
Maybe I should go with you.

06:07.889 --> 06:10.326
But fishing, worms, hooks.

06:10.370 --> 06:12.067
Ooh, and that smell.

06:14.069 --> 06:16.811
Now, if you're talking a weekend
getaway in Manhattan/ Oh.

06:16.854 --> 06:19.248
...South Beach, Vegas, maybe?
Mm. Ah.

06:19.291 --> 06:25.733
But, but it is your big 3-0.

06:25.776 --> 06:29.737
Jackson, most people would say,
"You shouldn't have,"

06:29.780 --> 06:32.261
but I'm not most people. 
It's... It's no big deal.

06:32.304 --> 06:35.438
Hmm.

06:35.482 --> 06:37.222
So you gonna open it,

06:37.266 --> 06:40.487
or should I add X-ray vision
to the list of superpowers?

06:40.530 --> 06:43.794
Well, I'll open it
thinking of you

06:43.838 --> 06:46.144
while I'm gutting the fish.

06:49.191 --> 06:50.714
Bye.

06:57.286 --> 06:59.462
Mommy! Mommy!
Come here!

06:59.506 --> 07:02.639
Unless someone's bleeding,
Mommy needs one sec.

07:02.683 --> 07:05.468
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy! Come here!

07:13.998 --> 07:16.305
Yay! Yay!
Yay! Yay!

07:16.348 --> 07:18.220
It's vanilla and sprinkles!

07:18.263 --> 07:20.527
That's my favorite!

07:20.570 --> 07:22.746
Oohh!

07:22.790 --> 07:24.792
What happened here?

07:24.835 --> 07:27.055
Oh! Mm.
Come here.

07:27.098 --> 07:29.623
Mommy's gonna
miss you both so much.

07:31.146 --> 07:32.930
We could all go with you...

07:32.974 --> 07:34.932
Yay, Mommy!
Yay, Mommy!

07:36.978 --> 07:38.675
Hey, guys,
why don't y'all grab the cake?

07:38.719 --> 07:40.634
Get the plates.
Get everything ready.

07:40.677 --> 07:42.636
Be careful.Careful.

07:42.679 --> 07:44.899
You got it, baby girl?

07:44.942 --> 07:47.292
I want us all together
for your birthday.

07:47.336 --> 07:48.990
Is that so bad?

07:49.033 --> 07:50.208
I wish we were going
as a family, too,

07:50.252 --> 07:53.124
but I promised Elizabeth.

07:53.168 --> 07:55.257
Have her and Rose come here.
We'll splurge.

07:55.300 --> 07:57.302
I'll barbecue shrimp,
celebrate together as a family.

07:57.346 --> 07:59.870
I would,
but it's her big day, too,

07:59.914 --> 08:01.524
and she just wanted it to be us.

08:01.568 --> 08:02.873
She doesn't have anyone.

08:02.917 --> 08:04.440
She's having
a little life crisis.

08:04.484 --> 08:06.268
Right.

08:06.311 --> 08:08.488
In her luxury apartment,
driving around in her Porsche,

08:08.531 --> 08:09.706
and her high-paying finance job

08:09.750 --> 08:11.099
surrounded by rich,
eligible men.

08:11.142 --> 08:12.492
It's not your fault
she's alone, Callie.

08:13.841 --> 08:15.625
Why are you making this harder?

08:15.669 --> 08:17.148
I didn't think that I was.

08:17.192 --> 08:18.410
Hey.

08:20.587 --> 08:22.763
Gonna miss you.

08:22.806 --> 08:25.026
Happy birthday.

08:35.558 --> 08:38.256
You don't like it?

08:38.299 --> 08:40.215
No, I love it.

08:40.258 --> 08:41.738
It's not the bracelet.

08:41.782 --> 08:46.090
What is it, sweetheart?

08:46.134 --> 08:49.311
It's not you, it's me.

08:49.354 --> 08:50.921
What's wrong,
Mommy?

08:50.965 --> 08:53.576
Nothing. I'm so happy.

08:53.620 --> 08:57.667
Look at the beautiful gift
Daddy gave me.

08:57.711 --> 08:59.277
This one is for you.

08:59.321 --> 09:01.105
And this one is for you.

09:01.149 --> 09:03.368
Can we eat it
before lunch, Mommy?

09:03.412 --> 09:06.110
Okay, let's cut this baby up!

09:06.154 --> 09:07.677
Oh, thank you.
Yay!

09:07.721 --> 09:09.853
Okay, ready? I'm gonna have
a piece.

09:27.915 --> 09:30.613
I love you, Callie.

09:30.657 --> 09:35.009
But I really need you to think
if you want this to work.

09:35.052 --> 09:37.359
You know I do.

09:37.402 --> 09:39.448
I'm trying.

09:39.491 --> 09:41.319
I want to believe you, but...

09:49.589 --> 09:52.374
Maybe you're right.

09:52.417 --> 09:55.029
When you come home,
I'll get my girl back.

09:56.770 --> 09:58.685
Happy birthday.

10:08.956 --> 10:10.784
Ruby's so jealous
of Jed's tee-ball trophy.

10:10.827 --> 10:13.700
She asked me why they don't
give awards for ballet.

10:13.743 --> 10:15.919
So sibling rivalry isgenetic.

10:15.963 --> 10:17.878
Lizzie and I don't compete.

10:17.921 --> 10:20.532
Oh, really?
You were always late.

10:20.576 --> 10:22.012
And Lizzie is Miss Punctual.

10:22.056 --> 10:24.145
I just thought you were
trying to one-up her.

10:24.188 --> 10:26.147
Traffic's gotten so bad.

10:26.190 --> 10:27.757
Mm-hmm.

10:27.801 --> 10:30.760
So, uh, how's Grady?

10:30.804 --> 10:33.067
Great.
Great?

10:33.110 --> 10:36.157
But you told me that... Oh, I mean...

10:36.200 --> 10:38.202
we have our bumps.

10:38.246 --> 10:39.856
Yeah.

10:43.425 --> 10:45.819
Whoa, that-that's a lot of...

10:45.862 --> 10:48.256
Well, you know
Lizzie can't eat spicy,

10:48.299 --> 10:50.258
so it's a good thing
it's just us.

10:50.301 --> 10:51.651
Mm-hmm.

10:51.694 --> 10:53.653
Hello!

10:53.696 --> 10:55.176
Aunt Rose!

10:55.219 --> 10:57.178
Oh, Callie!

10:57.221 --> 10:59.789
It is so good to see you.

10:59.833 --> 11:02.009
Aunt Rose, you got us mixed up.

11:02.052 --> 11:03.706
Oh, really?

11:06.883 --> 11:09.886
Confess, Elizabeth.

11:09.930 --> 11:13.063
Or Lizzie's about
to chow down on salsa so spicy,

11:13.107 --> 11:14.586
it'll make
a jalapeño peel itself.

11:14.630 --> 11:18.068
And as I recall,
last time you had spicy salsa

11:18.112 --> 11:20.636
was the Fourth of July picnic...

11:20.680 --> 11:22.725
where you pooped your pants?

11:24.031 --> 11:25.467
That's right.

11:25.510 --> 11:26.642
I don't know
what made more noise exploding,

11:26.686 --> 11:28.470
you or the fireworks.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.864
That's so embarrassing!
I told you this wouldn't work!

11:30.907 --> 11:32.648
Too bad, too, 'cause I was
about to convince you

11:32.692 --> 11:35.520
that Grady was having an affair
with Miranda Lambert.

11:35.564 --> 11:37.914
Bless y'all for tryin'.Hi.

11:45.661 --> 11:47.750
Where's the wine opener? 
Check the second drawer.

11:55.062 --> 11:57.499
Wow, when did you
start roasting chicken?!

11:57.542 --> 11:59.588
As soon as Costco
started roasting it for me.

11:59.631 --> 12:01.242
I confess,

12:01.285 --> 12:02.722
I would've been happy
with just some mac and cheese.

12:02.765 --> 12:05.246
Oh, tired of
your Michelin-star diet?

12:05.289 --> 12:07.030
Not the same
as a home-cooked meal.

12:07.074 --> 12:08.423
Oh,
it's the blue box. Who's that from?

12:08.466 --> 12:09.729
A friend.

12:09.772 --> 12:12.296
Jackson. No way!
Open it.

12:20.174 --> 12:21.479
Wow.

12:21.523 --> 12:23.830
That is quite an expensive gift.

12:28.225 --> 12:31.576
Well, how are you gonna
show your appreciation?

12:31.620 --> 12:33.622
I'm not sure what he wants.

12:33.665 --> 12:35.406
Oh, I know what he wants.

12:35.450 --> 12:38.279
Just because I'm trapped
in Fayetteville, Georgia,

12:38.322 --> 12:40.498
doesn't mean I don't know
the ways of the world.

12:40.542 --> 12:42.979
Oh, I'd hardly call
your life "trapped."

12:43.023 --> 12:44.807
Your mom and dad would be
so proud of you both.

12:44.851 --> 12:46.417
Really?
I'm a housewife.

12:46.461 --> 12:48.985
And I'm single and can't
keep a house plant alive.

12:49.029 --> 12:51.858
Which definitely
speaks "failure."

12:51.901 --> 12:53.685
You are a dedicated
wife and mother

12:53.729 --> 12:55.775
with a wonderful husband
and two wonderful kids.

12:55.818 --> 12:57.298
Who I really love,

12:57.341 --> 12:59.474
but I always thought
I'd be the one hob-nobbing

12:59.517 --> 13:01.084
with Atlanta who's who.

13:01.128 --> 13:03.565
My life would be more exciting
like Lizzie's.

13:03.608 --> 13:06.394
Oh, by "exciting", you mean
the nauseous pit of regret

13:06.437 --> 13:09.179
staring at the stream
of Tinder losers in your bed?

13:09.223 --> 13:11.616
Who got your motor revvin'
the night before!

13:11.660 --> 13:14.228
Oh, poor you, Lizzie,
the agony of $200

13:14.271 --> 13:16.708
expense meals
at four-star restaurants.

13:16.752 --> 13:18.798
With mind-numbing bores

13:18.841 --> 13:20.625
who make half-assed
drunk passes at you,

13:20.669 --> 13:23.454
pretending to giggle it away
for the sake of the account

13:23.498 --> 13:26.588
while fantasizing stabbing
your salad fork in their eye.

13:26.631 --> 13:27.894
Oh, pity you.

13:27.937 --> 13:29.591
With a closet
full of designer clothes,

13:29.634 --> 13:31.332
Chanel bags, and Louboutins.

13:31.375 --> 13:32.855
Oh, well, you've got me there.

13:32.899 --> 13:34.596
But not Loubies, Manolos.

13:34.639 --> 13:37.294
And don't forget
my fabulous pedicure!

13:37.338 --> 13:40.080
Enough of this bickering
before it's pistols at dawn.

13:45.912 --> 13:48.523
Now... let's eat.

13:50.917 --> 13:52.875
I know you two love me,

13:52.919 --> 13:55.922
but this is your big milestone.

13:55.965 --> 13:58.533
Why are you spending it here?

13:58.576 --> 14:00.883
You're surprised
we want to be with you?

14:00.927 --> 14:04.626
No, I just wasn't expecting
2 mid-life crises at 30.

14:04.669 --> 14:05.888
Well, if it's good enough
for Callie,

14:05.932 --> 14:08.021
it's good enough for me.

14:10.153 --> 14:13.417
Aww, it's our relay medals.

14:13.461 --> 14:16.725
They're all polished.

14:16.768 --> 14:19.423
I was so proud
of you two that day.

14:19.467 --> 14:23.123
But not because you cheated...

14:23.166 --> 14:26.691
I saw Lizzie swim your leg...

14:26.735 --> 14:29.390
but because it showed me
that you two

14:29.433 --> 14:34.134
would always be there
for each other no matter what.

14:34.177 --> 14:36.701
But now that you're grown,

14:36.745 --> 14:39.835
you've got to be accountable
to yourselves.

14:39.879 --> 14:41.184
Girls, you're not victims.

14:41.228 --> 14:42.925
You have made life choices.

14:42.969 --> 14:45.623
Own them.

14:45.667 --> 14:47.016
Sitting around
comparing disappointments,

14:47.060 --> 14:49.062
that doesn't do anygood.

14:49.105 --> 14:51.151
What do you expect me to do?

14:51.194 --> 14:53.936
Take charge!
Don't be afraid!

14:53.980 --> 14:55.807
Life's journey
goes down many roads.

14:55.851 --> 14:58.941
If you don't like one,
you try another.

14:58.985 --> 15:01.509
Same goes for you.

15:01.552 --> 15:04.773
You're the catch of the century.

15:04.816 --> 15:07.341
Do you really want to be alone?

15:07.384 --> 15:10.910
After your uncle died,
I made that choice.

15:10.953 --> 15:13.086
I don't recommend it.

15:13.129 --> 15:16.524
Aww, Auntie, we love you.
Aww, Auntie, we love you.

15:23.531 --> 15:25.968
Callie, you awake?

15:26.012 --> 15:27.665
Yeah.

15:27.709 --> 15:29.798
We should reconsider your plan.

15:29.841 --> 15:32.105
Why?

15:32.148 --> 15:33.758
We can't even fool Aunt Rose.

15:33.802 --> 15:35.325
She's known us our whole lives.

15:35.369 --> 15:37.632
Nobody else could ever
tell the difference.

15:37.675 --> 15:39.808
Remember Mrs. Hanson?

15:39.851 --> 15:44.204
Oh, yeah, that was
really mean of us.

15:44.247 --> 15:46.728
What makes you think
being me for a week

15:46.771 --> 15:48.686
is going to lead
to some great epiphany?

15:48.730 --> 15:50.384
You don't know
what it's like being me.

15:50.427 --> 15:52.473
You'll find out,
then you'll know.

15:54.040 --> 15:56.825
Just please, I really need this.

15:56.868 --> 15:58.914
Is that...?

15:58.958 --> 16:00.829
No way!

16:00.872 --> 16:02.874
It's for medicinal purposes.

16:02.918 --> 16:04.833
Auntie will smell it.

16:04.876 --> 16:06.922
And what, ground us?

16:10.230 --> 16:12.406
You should really
be talking to Grady.

16:12.449 --> 16:13.973
I mean, according to
the marriage handbook,

16:14.016 --> 16:16.105
you're supposed to
tell each other everything.

16:16.149 --> 16:17.367
What am I gonna say?

16:17.411 --> 16:19.239
"I'm bored."
"You're boring."

16:19.282 --> 16:23.721
"Our life is boring."
"I love you, but I want more."

16:23.765 --> 16:26.115
Besides, after what happened
with Avery, I...

16:26.159 --> 16:28.422
You said nothing happened.
It's over.

16:28.465 --> 16:30.990
It is, but it got close.

16:31.033 --> 16:33.775
What do you mean "close"?

16:33.818 --> 16:37.083
What's so terrible
about your life?

16:37.126 --> 16:39.520
I'm 30 years old
living four blocks

16:39.563 --> 16:41.739
from the Dairy Queen
where we were born.

16:41.783 --> 16:43.393
The only excitement I get

16:43.437 --> 16:46.005
is living vicariously
through your Instagram account.

16:46.048 --> 16:47.223
I don't remember the last time

16:47.267 --> 16:49.660
I was dress-up, on-the-town hot.

16:58.843 --> 17:01.977
Smells delicious. I'm starving.

17:02.021 --> 17:03.674
Mornin'.Good morning.

17:03.718 --> 17:05.633
After last night,

17:05.675 --> 17:08.940
I didn't know if you'd want
biscuits or a bag of Doritos.

17:10.550 --> 17:13.510
I thought we're spending
the weekend together.

17:13.554 --> 17:15.077
We talked all night
about what you said,

17:15.121 --> 17:16.644
and we're taking charge.

17:16.686 --> 17:18.906
But we'll be back next month
for your birthday.

17:18.950 --> 17:22.519
It was your advice.
Please don't be mad.

17:22.563 --> 17:26.567
All right,
happy birthday, girls!

17:26.609 --> 17:28.743
Breathe, right? Breathe, yes.

17:53.420 --> 17:56.292
Callie, what if Grady
wants to...

17:56.336 --> 17:58.773
you know, I'm looking h-o-t...

17:58.816 --> 18:00.731
Trust me, it's been months.

18:00.775 --> 18:03.430
He sleeps in the den watching
History Channel all night.

18:03.473 --> 18:05.736
One for the road?
Yes.

18:05.780 --> 18:08.130
Ready?

18:08.174 --> 18:10.611
I'm so happy we're doing this.
You're the best. I love you.

18:10.654 --> 18:14.310
Oh, you'd better give me that.
Good catch.

18:14.354 --> 18:17.748
Okay, don't forget
to forward your calls.

18:17.792 --> 18:20.186
Ahh!

18:20.229 --> 18:22.231
Bye!

18:31.458 --> 18:33.721
It's good to be you!

18:46.647 --> 18:49.432
Oh!

18:59.573 --> 19:01.749
Let's dance! Okay.

19:44.139 --> 19:46.272
- No black dress.
- ♪ I only want to dance with ♪

19:46.315 --> 19:49.318
I'm feeling gold tonight.

20:10.034 --> 20:12.559
- Mommy!
- Hi, sweet pea!

20:12.602 --> 20:14.952
Mommy missed you so much!

20:14.996 --> 20:17.564
Mommy's home!
Oh, surprise!

20:17.607 --> 20:20.349
Ahh!

20:20.393 --> 20:22.308
Mommy, I thought
you'd be gone all weekend!

20:22.351 --> 20:24.701
I missed you all.

20:24.745 --> 20:28.096
Mmm, you smell delicious,
I could eat you!

20:28.139 --> 20:30.316
That's what Aunt Lizzie does.

20:30.359 --> 20:32.535
Oh.You're home.

20:32.579 --> 20:35.146
Hi, um, I got presents!

20:35.190 --> 20:37.148
Presents?
Yes.

20:37.192 --> 20:39.673
Look,
this is for you. Whoa!

20:39.716 --> 20:41.588
This one's for you. Yay!

20:41.631 --> 20:43.416
And I didn't forget you!

20:43.459 --> 20:45.896
The G. Loomis
GLS spinning rod.

20:45.940 --> 20:47.855
Isn't that what
you told Lizzie you wanted?

20:47.898 --> 20:49.944
Yeah.

20:49.987 --> 20:52.163
But, Mommy, youwere supposed
to get the birthday presents.

20:52.207 --> 20:54.557
Well, it's my birthday.
It's my rules.

20:54.601 --> 20:56.298
And my rules say

20:56.342 --> 20:58.953
good children and good husbands
get presents.

20:58.996 --> 21:01.434
Get over here. Oh!

21:01.477 --> 21:04.306
Thank you.
Wow.

21:04.350 --> 21:07.309
But isn't this a bit much?

21:07.353 --> 21:11.008
I just had money stashed away
for Christmas.

21:11.052 --> 21:15.709
I love it, but what are
we gonna do for Christmas?

21:15.752 --> 21:17.972
All right, Lizzie gave me
a gift card for my birthday

21:18.015 --> 21:19.887
and I spent it on my family.

21:23.456 --> 21:24.805
Wow.

21:24.848 --> 21:27.242
That's a hell of a bracelet.

21:27.286 --> 21:30.201
And a little different
than the one you left with.

21:30.245 --> 21:33.770
Lizzie loved yours so much
she begged me to borrow it,

21:33.814 --> 21:36.251
so she said it made her
feel like part of the family

21:36.295 --> 21:38.340
and we traded,
but only for the weekend.

21:38.384 --> 21:40.386
I hope you don't mind.

21:40.429 --> 21:42.170
Um...

21:42.213 --> 21:44.215
Hello! Oh, that's Jessica.

21:44.259 --> 21:46.174
- Hi, Jessica!
- Who?

21:46.217 --> 21:48.394
Our babysitter.

21:48.437 --> 21:50.396
Oh, are you going out?
Yeah, picked up an extra shift.

21:50.439 --> 21:51.745
You weren't gonna be here,

21:51.788 --> 21:54.574
and we can always use
the extra money.

21:54.617 --> 21:58.621
Oh, okay. Hey, Jessica!
Change of plans.

21:58.665 --> 22:01.232
I'm gonna be here tonight,
so it's totally fine.

22:01.276 --> 22:03.017
But thank you for coming,

22:03.060 --> 22:04.975
and I-I'll call you
next weekend, okay?

22:05.019 --> 22:06.412
Okay.
All right, bye-bye.

22:06.455 --> 22:09.023
Hey, sweetheart,
I can call in and...

22:09.066 --> 22:10.677
No, no, no, no, no,
it's fine, honey.

22:10.720 --> 22:12.374
No, I don't have to go to work.
I can call in sick...

22:12.418 --> 22:14.245
You just go to work and I will
see you in the morning.

22:14.289 --> 22:15.943
Are you sure? Yeah, I'm gonna have
waffles waiting for you.

22:15.986 --> 22:18.467
Okay.
Bye, honey.

22:20.948 --> 22:23.690
Since when do you have
a Sephora store in your closet?

22:23.733 --> 22:25.039
I like to have choices.

22:25.082 --> 22:27.128
Choices.

22:27.171 --> 22:31.088
My dilemma... "rouge noir"
or "royal burgundy".

22:31.132 --> 22:33.221
What's Aunt Rose's
mac and cheese recipe again?

22:33.264 --> 22:37.007
Cheddar, parmesan,
butter, cream, no milk.

22:37.051 --> 22:38.748
Don't overcook the noodles,
and a pinch of white pepper.

22:38.792 --> 22:40.881
So how's it going there?

22:40.924 --> 22:42.665
- I almost blew it already.
- Mommy, we're hungry!

22:42.709 --> 22:44.754
The kids are more aware
of our differences than Grady.

22:44.798 --> 22:46.277
Figures.

22:46.321 --> 22:48.584
Did you find
your birthday present?

22:48.628 --> 22:50.847
It's gorgeous!
Okay, try crimson red.

22:50.891 --> 22:52.719
It'll go great with the dress.

22:52.762 --> 22:55.765
Trust me.
Wow, we are really doing this!

22:55.809 --> 22:58.377
Have fun, but not too much.

22:58.420 --> 23:01.031
I won't.
And you don't blow it.

24:00.526 --> 24:03.224
Mommy, you smell like
Aunt Lizzie.

24:03.267 --> 24:05.531
Oh!
You do!

24:05.574 --> 24:09.491
Well, that's because
I'm wearing her perfume!

24:11.537 --> 24:13.669
Okay, get under here.

24:13.713 --> 24:17.020
But you never wear smelly stuff.

24:17.064 --> 24:19.762
Well, today is special!

24:19.806 --> 24:22.939
Sweet dreams.

24:28.554 --> 24:31.121
Jackson's here.
What?!

24:31.165 --> 24:33.994
With a date.
A very pretty.

24:34.037 --> 24:36.126
Avoid him.
Or what?

24:36.170 --> 24:38.085
You're gonna spread me
with peanut butter?

24:38.128 --> 24:39.216
I knew
this was a bad idea.

24:39.260 --> 24:41.523
Relax, it'll be fine.

24:41.567 --> 24:43.090
So how's it going there?

24:43.133 --> 24:45.266
Peaches and cream.
Grady's working overtime.

24:46.963 --> 24:49.009
Oh, if he asks,
tell him I gave you a gift card

24:49.052 --> 24:50.619
for your birthday
instead of a present.

24:50.663 --> 24:52.099
Why?

24:52.142 --> 24:54.710
I brought everyone presents.

24:54.754 --> 24:56.233
Who's Jackson with?

24:56.277 --> 24:58.845
I'll find out.
No, you won't!

25:00.237 --> 25:02.065
Ugh.

25:05.025 --> 25:06.766
Oh.

25:06.809 --> 25:08.550
You're not supposed to be here.

25:08.594 --> 25:12.293
Um, Callie had
a family emergency.

25:12.336 --> 25:14.774
Oh, I'm glad you came.

25:14.817 --> 25:19.474
Yes, but will
Tinder-licious be glad?

25:19.518 --> 25:21.345
Darcy from accounting?

25:21.389 --> 25:23.783
Oh, silly me.

25:23.826 --> 25:26.220
I didn't recognize her
without her computer.

25:26.263 --> 25:27.917
Right.

25:27.961 --> 25:31.399
Well, since you're back,
I assume your schedule's open?

25:31.442 --> 25:34.620
Well, who says
I don't have plans?

25:34.663 --> 25:37.753
Damn, all by myself
at the Hawks game tomorrow?

25:37.797 --> 25:39.407
Hmm...

25:39.450 --> 25:41.931
Half court, third row.

25:41.975 --> 25:45.108
And you didn't open my present.

25:45.152 --> 25:46.588
Oh, of course not.

25:46.632 --> 25:49.025
I'm saving it
for my actual birthday.

25:49.069 --> 25:51.419
I need something
to look forward to.

25:54.030 --> 25:56.903
Why don't we get a drink?
Yes.

26:18.533 --> 26:20.622
Hey, party girl.
How's it feel to be me?

26:20.666 --> 26:22.189
I left you
like a billion messages.

26:22.232 --> 26:23.625
Mm, horrible.

26:23.669 --> 26:25.496
There's no almond milk
for my espresso,

26:25.540 --> 26:28.456
but I bought Dior lipstick
to make up for it.

26:28.499 --> 26:30.110
Hey, baby.

26:33.156 --> 26:34.462
What's wrong with you?

26:38.248 --> 26:39.989
Sweetheart,
Ohl know it's been a while,

26:40.033 --> 26:42.513
but it's not like
anything's changed.

26:44.690 --> 26:47.693
Jesus!
Callie, a little privacy.

26:47.736 --> 26:49.259
Hey, Liz.

26:51.218 --> 26:53.002
Callie, this is getting weird!

26:53.046 --> 26:54.613
You see!
I told you so.

26:54.656 --> 26:56.658
There I am naked
and Grady didn't even notice me.

26:56.702 --> 26:59.008
Well, t-technically you.

26:59.052 --> 27:01.445
Ididn't notice.
I was in shock!

27:01.489 --> 27:04.057
He's not interested anymore.
Please!

27:04.100 --> 27:05.406
Just... okay, wait,
tell me about last night.

27:05.449 --> 27:07.060
What happened with Jackson?

27:07.103 --> 27:09.671
He is reallyinto you.

27:09.715 --> 27:12.195
Oh, that is not funny.
It's time to come home.

27:12.239 --> 27:13.675
Jed and Ruby are too smart.

27:13.719 --> 27:16.069
I swear they're onto us.
Um, can't.

27:16.112 --> 27:17.418
I'm going to the Hawks game
with him today.

27:17.461 --> 27:19.028
No, you're not!
This ends now!

27:19.072 --> 27:20.551
I'm doing this for you.

27:20.595 --> 27:22.292
Don't live my life for me.

27:22.336 --> 27:24.251
At least you have a life!

27:24.294 --> 27:25.774
Oh, enough with the self-pity!

27:25.818 --> 27:28.647
Stop being such a selfish,
judgmental bitch!

27:28.690 --> 27:30.257
W...

27:30.300 --> 27:33.477
Callie! God!

27:48.971 --> 27:50.277
Hello.

27:50.320 --> 27:52.061
You're off to a bad start.

27:52.105 --> 27:54.063
What are you talking about?

27:54.107 --> 27:56.239
Our first date and you're late.

27:56.283 --> 27:58.285
Is this a date?

27:58.328 --> 27:59.982
If it's not, then...

28:00.026 --> 28:02.768
Oh, it's the first of many.

28:07.555 --> 28:09.992
Elizabeth!

28:10.036 --> 28:11.298
Lizzie!

28:13.517 --> 28:16.390
Lizzie, Lizzie, talk to me.

28:16.433 --> 28:18.435
Somebody help me!
Call an ambulance!

28:51.381 --> 28:55.516
Yeah, yeah, here she is.
It's, um, it's Aunt Rose.

30:26.694 --> 30:27.956
You okay?

30:28.000 --> 30:30.263
Here, let me get you some water.

30:33.309 --> 30:36.747
Elizabeth, my Callie?

30:36.791 --> 30:42.362
Lizzie, it's you.
My God.

30:42.405 --> 30:44.886
Lizzie, what happened?

30:44.930 --> 30:48.107
Callie...
she wanted a week away.

30:48.150 --> 30:49.673
What?!

30:49.717 --> 30:51.980
Does Grady know you're you?

30:52.024 --> 30:54.461
Oh, my God, oh, my God.

30:54.504 --> 30:57.029
Those poor children.
Those poor children.

30:57.072 --> 30:58.900
I know.

30:58.944 --> 31:01.947
What have you girls done?

31:01.990 --> 31:04.210
Lizzie, you have to tell them.

31:09.998 --> 31:12.653
I've been working with
Elizabeth for many years now.

31:12.696 --> 31:16.526
She was an incredible partner.

31:16.570 --> 31:21.096
She made us look forward
to Mondays, right?

31:21.140 --> 31:24.883
She made everyone
fall in love with her.

31:24.926 --> 31:26.449
Everyone.

31:26.493 --> 31:28.364
Including me.

31:32.499 --> 31:37.678
I-I didn't know it.
It just kind of snuck up on me.

31:39.114 --> 31:41.334
Now she's gone.

31:41.377 --> 31:44.206
I'm gonna miss her.

31:44.250 --> 31:49.124
I miss her so much.

31:49.168 --> 31:51.387
And, um, she truly is

31:51.431 --> 31:54.347
the most remarkable woman...

31:54.390 --> 31:56.479
that I've ever met.

31:59.178 --> 32:00.962
Thank you.

32:24.246 --> 32:26.335
My sister was my best friend.

32:32.863 --> 32:34.735
Callie.

32:59.934 --> 33:03.677
Um...

33:05.374 --> 33:09.726
I'm sure you can all imagine...

33:09.770 --> 33:13.295
how overwhelming this is
for my wife.

33:13.339 --> 33:15.297
When I first
started dating Callie,

33:15.341 --> 33:17.560
I was terrified of Elizabeth.

33:17.604 --> 33:19.954
You think it's hard
getting a father'sapproval,

33:19.998 --> 33:21.173
try getting a twin's.

33:22.739 --> 33:24.480
The two of them,

33:24.524 --> 33:26.352
they had this connection
that I could never understand,

33:26.395 --> 33:28.919
a-a bond that I knew
I would never be a part of.

33:31.661 --> 33:33.663
But Lizzie... she...

33:33.707 --> 33:35.709
she included me.

33:38.190 --> 33:41.497
She showed me how to be
a part of their lives

33:41.541 --> 33:45.023
with her kind, sweet,
generous spirit.

33:45.066 --> 33:48.809
When you marry a twin,
you marry her sister, also.

33:48.852 --> 33:51.333
'Cause one doesn't exist
without the other.

33:51.377 --> 33:55.207
In marrying Callie, I not only
gained a wife and a best friend,

33:55.250 --> 33:59.167
but I gained twobest friends.

33:59.211 --> 34:01.865
But I know that she...
she multiplied

34:01.909 --> 34:06.609
the love in my life
and Ruby and Jed's life by two.

34:06.653 --> 34:08.958
But she's gonna be missed
beyond measure.

34:20.580 --> 34:22.321
You have got
to tell Grady the truth.

34:22.364 --> 34:25.324
The more time you let go by,
the harder it's gonna be.

34:25.367 --> 34:27.717
2:34 P.M.

34:27.761 --> 34:32.418
2:34 P.M.,
March 2, 1995.

34:32.460 --> 34:35.333
The exact minute,
the exact second on the clock,

34:35.377 --> 34:36.987
everything before that moment
was one life

34:37.031 --> 34:39.773
and everything
that followed was another.

34:39.815 --> 34:43.864
But in my mind,
Mom's face is always linked

34:43.907 --> 34:46.649
to the face of that
goddamn bloodshot principal

34:46.693 --> 34:50.652
pulling me out of class
to tell me about the accident.

34:50.697 --> 34:52.960
I won't do that to these kids.

34:53.003 --> 34:54.614
No, I'm not gonna be
the face of doom,

34:54.657 --> 34:58.966
the face of death to them.

34:59.009 --> 35:02.404
But you cannot...
you cannot keep pretending.

35:02.448 --> 35:05.929
Well, maybe I can't.
Maybe I can.

35:05.973 --> 35:08.149
I have no kids, no husband,

35:08.193 --> 35:10.630
a job I like but don't love.

35:10.673 --> 35:13.067
Who could disappear, poof,
gone from this Earth right now

35:13.111 --> 35:14.547
and do the least damage?

35:14.590 --> 35:16.157
Whose death would be easier
to swallow...

35:16.201 --> 35:18.464
Callie or Elizabeth?

35:18.507 --> 35:21.597
Mommy, come be here with us.

35:23.208 --> 35:26.646
A Mom... they need me.

35:26.689 --> 35:29.692
I owe it to Callie.

35:29.736 --> 35:32.173
You are not thinkin' clearly!

35:32.217 --> 35:33.566
You have a life,

35:33.609 --> 35:35.524
and you heard
how Jackson feels about you!

35:42.444 --> 35:44.490
Grady, I want
to stop by Lizzie's.

35:44.533 --> 35:45.708
Buckle up.

35:56.763 --> 36:01.985
You sure you want to stay here
at your sister's?

36:02.029 --> 36:04.162
I'd feel better
spending the night here,

36:04.205 --> 36:07.077
being around her,
but you can take the kids home.

36:07.121 --> 36:10.864
No, we stay together.

36:10.907 --> 36:14.650
Do you know the code?

36:14.694 --> 36:16.043
22-22. Doubles.
Two of a kind.

36:16.086 --> 36:19.655
2222.

36:38.283 --> 36:39.632
Thanks.

36:39.675 --> 36:42.243
Mommy, please!

36:42.287 --> 36:45.725
Mommy, please come! Is that Jed?

36:45.768 --> 36:47.248
I got him.

36:47.292 --> 36:51.383
Please, Mommy!
Mommy, come please!

36:51.426 --> 36:53.036
Buddy, it's okay.
It's okay, little man.

36:53.080 --> 36:55.125
No! I want Mommy! I'm here. I'm here.

36:55.169 --> 36:57.171
I want Mommy!
I want Mommy!

36:57.215 --> 36:58.694
I'm right here. I want Mommy!

36:58.738 --> 37:00.087
I don't want you to die!

37:00.130 --> 37:02.524
I don't want anything
to happen to you.

37:02.568 --> 37:03.873
Nothing's gonna happen.

37:03.917 --> 37:05.919
No, no, no!
No, no, no, shh.

37:05.962 --> 37:08.095
No! No! Shh, shh.
No, it's okay.

37:08.138 --> 37:10.358
Nothing going to happen.
Nothing's gonna...

37:18.453 --> 37:20.847
How's he doing?

37:22.936 --> 37:25.417
I think losing Lizzie...

37:25.460 --> 37:28.028
is catching up with him.

37:28.071 --> 37:30.291
Coming here
might've been a mistake.

37:37.385 --> 37:39.387
Come have
some chamomile tea.

37:39.431 --> 37:41.259
It'll relax you.

37:41.302 --> 37:43.086
I'm too wired.

37:43.130 --> 37:45.306
Where are you going?

37:45.350 --> 37:48.570
I just need to...
step out.

37:48.614 --> 37:51.312
Take a walk.
Just get some air.

37:51.356 --> 37:54.141
I can wait up with you.

37:54.184 --> 37:56.448
Just go to bed, Grady.
Don't wait up.

38:07.415 --> 38:10.375
I'm worried about her, Rose.

38:10.418 --> 38:12.899
There's something off.
I...

38:12.942 --> 38:15.118
I don't know what to do.

38:17.773 --> 38:19.471
She'll be fine.

38:21.168 --> 38:23.649
Jackson, I need to see you.
I'm on my way.

38:36.314 --> 38:38.664
Callie, are you okay?
What's wrong?

38:41.754 --> 38:43.930
W-What's the matter?

38:45.801 --> 38:49.152
It's me. Lizzie.

38:49.196 --> 38:53.809
Callie was the one killed.

38:53.853 --> 38:55.420
Callie...

38:55.463 --> 38:59.119
Remember last time
I saw you in your office,

38:59.162 --> 39:03.384
you gave me a gift
and I didn't open it?

39:03.428 --> 39:06.387
And I wish I had...

39:06.431 --> 39:09.390
because I love it.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.436
And I love you.

39:11.479 --> 39:14.003
Oh, my God, Lizzie.

39:14.047 --> 39:15.701
It's you?

39:36.765 --> 39:39.202
Mommy!
We're hungry! We're hungry!

39:39.246 --> 39:41.727
I burnt the eggs.
Shoot.

39:41.770 --> 39:43.642
Aunt Rose,
where's Mom?

39:43.685 --> 39:45.948
She went out.
Go get dressed.

39:50.649 --> 39:54.174
Callie drove home last night.

39:54.217 --> 39:57.786
She texted me saying
she needed to be alone.

39:57.830 --> 40:00.136
We're not doing well.

40:00.180 --> 40:02.443
I don't know what to do.
I-I'm trying to be patient.

40:02.487 --> 40:04.750
She just keeps
pushing me away and...

40:04.793 --> 40:07.143
You just, uh... go to work.

40:07.187 --> 40:09.145
I'll check on her and
pick up the kids after school.

40:14.237 --> 40:16.196
All right.

40:16.239 --> 40:17.937
Thank you.

40:50.752 --> 40:53.146
How can I put Grady
and the kids through more pain?

40:53.189 --> 40:55.148
I mean,
you heard Jed last night.

40:55.191 --> 40:57.367
You can't keep
pretending forever,

40:57.411 --> 40:58.804
and you just
can't become Callie.

40:58.847 --> 41:02.242
It's not fair to them.
Why not?

41:02.285 --> 41:03.983
And I've been thinking,
maybe it'd be better

41:04.026 --> 41:06.855
to let Lizzie stay dead
and raise Jed and Ruby.

41:06.899 --> 41:09.945
Do you hear yourself?!

41:09.989 --> 41:12.034
I am not listening
to this foolishness.

41:12.078 --> 41:13.427
The kids need a mother.

41:13.471 --> 41:17.126
This isn't
a school-girl prank anymore!

41:17.170 --> 41:19.694
It's not fair
to Callie's memory.

41:32.968 --> 41:34.492
You can raise those children

41:34.535 --> 41:37.407
and love them as your own.

41:37.451 --> 41:39.235
I did it when your parents died.

41:39.279 --> 41:43.022
Out of that tragedy
was the best part of my life.

41:50.333 --> 41:53.554
I told Jackson
the truth last night.

41:53.598 --> 41:58.254
Well, that's... that's a start.

41:58.298 --> 42:00.561
What'd he say?

42:03.216 --> 42:05.174
After the shock,
he was thrilled.

42:05.218 --> 42:08.961
I mean, he wants me
back at the office.

42:09.004 --> 42:10.353
How can I go back
to my old life?

42:10.397 --> 42:12.747
I mean, it's so shallow now.

42:12.791 --> 42:14.314
Everything's different.

42:17.317 --> 42:20.276
You have to find a balance
that works for you two.

42:24.237 --> 42:26.587
I'll tell Grady tonight.

42:26.631 --> 42:29.329
Thank you.

42:43.343 --> 42:45.737
Who is that?

42:45.780 --> 42:49.610
Uh, Jackson, Liz's partner.

42:52.700 --> 42:55.442
A little late, don't you think?

42:55.485 --> 42:57.139
It's not that late.

43:02.754 --> 43:04.756
Callie, I want
to trust you, but...

43:22.034 --> 43:24.558
Sorry.
You can't keep pushing me away.

43:24.602 --> 43:26.908
You gotta let me in.

43:28.867 --> 43:31.609
There's something
you need to know.

43:31.652 --> 43:34.220
Baby, what is it?

43:42.837 --> 43:45.057
Talk to me!

43:47.015 --> 43:49.757
Lizzie and me, we...

43:49.801 --> 43:52.455
had a fight.

43:52.499 --> 43:53.761
The last thing
she ever said to me

43:53.805 --> 43:56.503
was I was a selfish...

43:56.546 --> 43:58.679
judgmental bitch.

43:58.723 --> 44:00.028
No, no, no.

44:00.072 --> 44:02.509
You know
that she didn't mean that.

44:02.552 --> 44:05.643
She loved you.
You know she did.

44:05.686 --> 44:09.429
I didn't get a chance
to say goodbye.

44:09.472 --> 44:11.431
I just need...

44:11.474 --> 44:13.085
Tell me what you need. Just time!

44:38.197 --> 44:41.156
What the hell
are you doing here?

44:41.200 --> 44:42.636
You lose my money,

44:42.680 --> 44:43.942
and now you don't return
my phone calls!

44:43.985 --> 44:46.118
Get out.
I'm calling the cops.

44:48.120 --> 44:50.731
Get out!
I need my money!

44:50.775 --> 44:52.820
You knew the inherent risks.

44:52.864 --> 44:54.561
That money belongs
to the people I work for.

44:54.604 --> 44:55.997
Is this dirty money?

44:56.041 --> 44:58.130
Don't give me
that self-righteous...

44:58.173 --> 44:59.697
Look, what you thought,
I was investing for St. Jude?!

44:59.740 --> 45:02.047
You know what, you and
your greedy bitch partner...

45:02.090 --> 45:03.396
What'd you say?
You know, all y'all saw

45:03.439 --> 45:04.919
was big commissions.
That's all you saw!

45:04.963 --> 45:06.878
You never asked
where the money came from

45:06.921 --> 45:09.141
because you didn't care
where the money came from.

45:09.184 --> 45:11.056
So what, I'm supposed to
just embezzle money

45:11.099 --> 45:13.014
from another account
to make up for yourlosses?

45:13.058 --> 45:14.537
You know,
for a seemingly smart guy,

45:14.581 --> 45:16.409
you're rather dense!

45:16.452 --> 45:19.412
Figured you would've
figured that out last Sunday.

45:23.764 --> 45:25.897
You killed Elizabeth's sister?!

45:37.343 --> 45:38.736
Get up!

45:52.227 --> 45:56.928
"It's... all... too much."

46:10.071 --> 46:12.378
Callie Sawyer?

46:12.421 --> 46:14.510
Yes?

46:14.554 --> 46:17.078
You're a twin?

46:17.122 --> 46:18.732
Can I help you?

46:18.776 --> 46:20.647
Jackson Kincaid.

46:20.690 --> 46:23.606
Yeah?
Do you know him?

46:23.650 --> 46:24.912
Yes, he's...

46:24.956 --> 46:27.175
wasmy sister's partner.

46:27.219 --> 46:28.524
Is he all right?

46:28.568 --> 46:30.352
What's going on,
honey?

46:30.396 --> 46:32.964
Who's this? Um, this is...?

46:33.007 --> 46:34.748
Detective Tucker.

46:34.792 --> 46:37.316
Look, I unfortunately
have some bad news.

46:37.359 --> 46:39.318
Mr. Kincaid
died last night.

46:46.325 --> 46:48.283
That's not possible.

46:48.327 --> 46:49.937
I just saw him.

46:49.981 --> 46:51.765
He... He was at
my sister's funeral.

46:51.809 --> 46:53.201
How did he die?

46:53.245 --> 46:55.595
It appears to be a suicide.

46:55.638 --> 46:58.163
Poor guy jumped off his balcony.

46:58.206 --> 47:01.035
No, impossible.

47:01.079 --> 47:02.776
I-I'm sorry, I don't understand.

47:02.820 --> 47:04.560
What does this
have to do with Callie?

47:04.604 --> 47:06.911
You know, we're finding
some irregularities

47:06.954 --> 47:08.564
with
Mr. Kincaid's death.

47:08.608 --> 47:10.523
And given the coincidence

47:10.566 --> 47:12.264
that your sister was killed
by a hit-and-run...

47:12.307 --> 47:13.961
What? Are you saying
they're connected?

47:14.005 --> 47:16.529
Oh, I'm not saying anything
at this point.

47:16.572 --> 47:19.488
But it would certainly help if
I could ask you some questions.

47:19.532 --> 47:22.622
I'm sorry, no,
my wife is still grieving.

47:22.665 --> 47:23.841
Can we...
maybe do this in a few...

47:23.884 --> 47:26.104
No, it's fine.
It's fine.

47:26.147 --> 47:27.975
A-Are you sure?

47:28.019 --> 47:30.630
I'm happy to drive her.

47:30.673 --> 47:32.719
I'll have her back
in no time at all.

47:46.298 --> 47:49.083
When was the last time
you spoke with your sister?

47:49.127 --> 47:50.868
The day she died.

47:50.911 --> 47:53.000
She wasn't upset or anything?

47:53.044 --> 47:54.784
She was having some issues.

47:54.828 --> 47:56.177
About...?

47:56.221 --> 47:58.223
Just the same as
all of us... life.

47:58.266 --> 48:00.094
Besides being business partners,

48:00.138 --> 48:04.229
were Elizabeth
and Mr. Kincaid involved?

48:04.272 --> 48:06.753
It was heading
in that direction.

48:06.796 --> 48:08.624
Sexually?

48:08.668 --> 48:11.236
No, this is just getting
really personal.

48:11.279 --> 48:12.715
I understand.
But I got to ask.

48:12.759 --> 48:14.804
Why?

48:14.848 --> 48:17.372
If you think he killed himself
over her death, you're wrong.

48:17.416 --> 48:19.374
Excuse me?
He wouldn't have killed himself

48:19.418 --> 48:21.376
over Lizzie's death,
I'm positive.

48:23.074 --> 48:25.815
How do you know?

48:25.859 --> 48:29.994
I just do is all.

48:30.037 --> 48:32.605
Is there something
you're not telling me?

48:34.389 --> 48:37.044
If... If he killed himself,
did he leave a note?

48:37.088 --> 48:38.437
As a matter of fact,

48:38.480 --> 48:40.439
there was a note
typed on his computer.

48:40.482 --> 48:41.962
Okay, what did it say?

48:44.573 --> 48:46.749
"It's all too much."

48:48.360 --> 48:52.233
That just doesn't
sound anything like him.

48:52.277 --> 48:54.975
M-May I have some water? Follow me.

48:58.631 --> 49:00.633
You say you barely know him,

49:00.676 --> 49:02.809
but you seem so certain
about everything.

49:02.852 --> 49:05.377
I'm certain my sister
never slept with him.

49:05.420 --> 49:08.641
We shared everything,
kept no secrets.

49:08.684 --> 49:11.644
Let me ask you, why would a man
with a successful business,

49:11.687 --> 49:14.690
plenty of money, and a healthy
social life kill himself?

49:14.734 --> 49:16.388
He wouldn't, detective.

49:16.431 --> 49:18.433
You implying he was murdered?

49:18.477 --> 49:20.348
If he was,
then whoever pushed him

49:20.392 --> 49:22.829
over that balcony
murdered my sister, as well.

49:24.352 --> 49:26.180
Are you certain
there's nothing else

49:26.224 --> 49:28.443
you can add to this puzzle?

49:36.234 --> 49:38.671
This was about money.
What a waste.

49:38.714 --> 49:40.716
Why would anyone
want to murder us?

49:42.718 --> 49:46.374
How did Finch get $3 million?

49:46.418 --> 49:48.550
How did this happen?

50:01.911 --> 50:04.958
Jackson, what did you
get us into?

50:52.136 --> 50:55.356
I'm so sorry, Callie.

50:55.400 --> 50:57.880
Should be me lying there.

51:32.045 --> 51:35.004
Remember when I was
smoking in the bathroom?

51:35.048 --> 51:38.095
The smoke alarms went off
and fire trucks arrived

51:38.138 --> 51:40.880
and the camp was evacuated?

51:40.923 --> 51:44.623
And I was so scared
I was gonna get busted.

51:44.666 --> 51:46.146
And you promised,
no matter what,

51:46.190 --> 51:48.235
you would never leave me alone.

51:53.893 --> 51:55.982
Principal suspended
poor Mrs. Hanson

51:56.025 --> 51:59.420
for smoking in the classroom.

51:59.464 --> 52:01.596
She knew it was one of us
but couldn't prove who.

52:06.775 --> 52:08.777
I haven't smoked a cig till now.

52:11.824 --> 52:14.000
Now I'm all alone.

52:18.178 --> 52:20.354
You had so much living
left to do.

52:25.316 --> 52:31.060
I promise I'll take care of Jed,
Ruby, Grady, no matter what.

52:31.104 --> 52:33.889
College, everything.

52:33.933 --> 52:36.979
Might just
take up smoking again.

53:17.194 --> 53:18.760
Hey!

53:18.804 --> 53:21.067
Oh, hi.

53:21.110 --> 53:22.982
Your sister passed
three weeks ago

53:23.025 --> 53:25.071
and you haven't returned one
of my calls or any of my texts.

53:25.114 --> 53:27.465
Um, I'm sorry.
I-I didn't mean to...

53:27.508 --> 53:28.944
No, I told you what would happen
if you didn't tell Grady,

53:28.988 --> 53:31.469
and I was right. What are you
doing here?

53:31.512 --> 53:33.732
Do you think I'd go away?
There'd be no contact with me?

53:33.775 --> 53:35.690
What do you think you're doing? Hey!
You come into my house...

53:35.734 --> 53:37.431
She doesn't even love you.
Avery, stop it! Yes, I do!

53:38.954 --> 53:40.173
Whatever you built up
in your head, Avery,

53:40.217 --> 53:41.348
is nothing but a fantasy!

53:41.392 --> 53:42.958
You just go.
Now!

53:43.002 --> 53:45.222
Before I call the police.

53:47.746 --> 53:49.574
Don't come back here.

53:49.617 --> 53:52.229
You get in your car
and you leave now.

53:56.668 --> 53:58.974
Callie. Callie!

54:02.587 --> 54:04.589
You still seeing him?

54:04.632 --> 54:06.286
I was never seeing him.

54:06.330 --> 54:08.462
I told you nothing... He's at our house!

54:08.506 --> 54:09.637
I was never seeing him.

54:09.681 --> 54:12.727
He was lying.
He was lying.

54:12.771 --> 54:14.773
I never slept with him.
I never slept with him.

54:14.816 --> 54:17.645
Please believe me.
Please believe me.

54:19.343 --> 54:24.217
I believe you, Callie.

54:24.261 --> 54:26.915
The promise was
for better or worse.

54:30.484 --> 54:32.704
I miss my wife.

54:36.577 --> 54:38.318
I love you.

54:59.426 --> 55:03.604
Good morning, sunshine.

55:03.648 --> 55:06.781
Last night was fantastic.

55:08.653 --> 55:10.872
Morning.
The kids are... Aunt Rose.

55:16.661 --> 55:18.576
Uh, would you mind taking
the kids to school this morning?

55:18.619 --> 55:20.969
We're running
a... a little slow.

55:35.419 --> 55:36.855
I did a terrible thing,

55:36.898 --> 55:38.509
and I'm afraid
my family's in danger.

55:38.552 --> 55:40.946
Slow down, Callie. My name is not Callie.

55:40.989 --> 55:43.644
Elizabeth's not dead.
I'm Elizabeth.

55:53.306 --> 55:54.612
Dance with me.
Oh.

55:54.655 --> 55:56.178
No more doom and gloom.

55:56.222 --> 55:58.442
Oh, Grady!

55:58.485 --> 56:00.182
You got one more in you.
Grady, what has gotten into you?

56:00.226 --> 56:01.880
I want to make my wife happy.

56:01.923 --> 56:03.534
She's been asking me to paint.
It's time to do it.

56:03.577 --> 56:04.709
Look, I know that
what happened with Lizzie

56:04.752 --> 56:07.059
is a terrible tragedy.

56:07.102 --> 56:10.192
Maybe out of that tragedy,
something good can come from it.

56:10.236 --> 56:12.281
I think that
it's brought us closer together

56:12.325 --> 56:13.631
in... in a way
that I never expected,

56:13.674 --> 56:16.198
but I think
Callie's changed, too.

56:16.242 --> 56:18.287
I mean, she's still
the same old Callie.

56:18.331 --> 56:20.289
I feel like a little bit
of Lizzie slipped in, too.

56:21.682 --> 56:25.773
Did you tell
your brother-in-law?

56:25.817 --> 56:27.427
Tonight.

56:27.471 --> 56:29.516
Perhaps you should
hold off on that.

56:29.560 --> 56:31.257
If your suspicions are correct,

56:31.300 --> 56:32.998
then it's safer for everyone

56:33.041 --> 56:35.522
that you remain dead
a little while longer.

56:35.566 --> 56:38.177
I can't keep this up.

56:38.220 --> 56:40.179
Give us some time
to investigate.

56:43.574 --> 56:45.576
Why don't...
Why don't I take the kids

56:45.619 --> 56:46.925
to the lake for a few days.

56:46.968 --> 56:48.492
You two need, uh,
time alone together.

56:48.535 --> 56:50.450
That'd be amazing.

56:50.494 --> 56:53.453
Now, look, I picked up some
paint samples on my way home.

56:53.497 --> 56:54.585
What do you think
she'll like the most?

56:54.628 --> 56:58.153
We got peach, maybe lavender?

56:58.197 --> 56:59.633
Hell, I'll even paint
it rose after you.

56:59.677 --> 57:01.896
I just want to make her happy.

57:01.940 --> 57:03.637
Am I gonna need a lawyer?

57:03.681 --> 57:07.075
Right now, we need to focus on
who would want you dead.

57:10.470 --> 57:12.254
Our entire client list.

57:23.701 --> 57:25.137
Surprise!

57:25.180 --> 57:28.314
Summer orange mist.
Do you like it?

57:28.357 --> 57:30.708
It's, um, bright.

57:30.751 --> 57:33.014
Yes, it is.
Uh, where's the kids?

57:33.058 --> 57:34.886
Uh, Rose took them
for the weekend.

57:34.929 --> 57:36.975
She thought you and I
could use a little alone time.

57:37.018 --> 57:40.195
Oh, oh, oh, you're all goopy.
Careful with my clothes.

57:40.239 --> 57:41.588
I'll take 'em off.
We'll body paint.

57:41.632 --> 57:43.895
No, no, no, no, no,
you finish, please!

57:43.938 --> 57:45.592
It looks so good.
Love it!

57:45.636 --> 57:47.289
You like it?
Yes!

57:47.333 --> 57:49.466
Keep going!

58:09.268 --> 58:11.052
Can I help you with something?

58:11.096 --> 58:12.924
Here to see Elizabeth.

58:12.967 --> 58:15.579
This is her sister
Callie's house.

58:15.622 --> 58:17.276
You a friend of Elizabeth?

58:17.319 --> 58:19.452
Business associate.

58:19.496 --> 58:21.062
I'm sorry to tell you this,

58:21.106 --> 58:24.370
but Elizabeth passed away,
Mr...?

58:24.413 --> 58:26.459
May I talk to Callie? About what?

58:26.503 --> 58:28.069
Grady?

58:32.596 --> 58:34.423
No.
Should I?

58:34.467 --> 58:35.860
I don't know who you are,

58:35.903 --> 58:37.339
but I think you need
to get out of there.

58:37.383 --> 58:38.558
And you definitely
stay away from my wife.

58:38.602 --> 58:41.126
But this isn't your wife.

58:41.169 --> 58:43.520
She's playing you
for a chump, pal.

58:43.563 --> 58:48.002
But you know why
I'm here... Elizabeth.

58:48.046 --> 58:49.395
Elizabeth.

58:49.438 --> 58:51.310
What's he talking about?

58:57.185 --> 58:59.971
Grady,
I'm so sorry.

59:00.014 --> 59:01.973
I was going to tell you.

59:05.019 --> 59:07.108
Elizabeth.

59:09.937 --> 59:13.680
It was only
going to be for a week.

59:13.724 --> 59:17.510
You've been living this lie.

59:17.554 --> 59:20.600
What were you planning to do?

59:20.644 --> 59:25.605
You just gonna let me
and the kids live with this

59:25.649 --> 59:27.520
while you go on
pretending to be their mother...

59:27.564 --> 59:29.478
my wife...

59:29.522 --> 59:33.352
while Callie's
lying dead in your grave?

59:33.395 --> 59:35.920
I don't know. Y-You don't know.

59:35.963 --> 59:38.575
When were you planning on
figuring it out?

59:38.618 --> 59:40.185
After sleeping with me?

59:40.228 --> 59:41.926
Grady, please.

59:41.969 --> 59:44.624
My wife is dead because of you.

59:44.668 --> 59:46.974
I mean, who was that guy?

59:47.018 --> 59:49.324
I don't know what's real or not anymore.

59:49.368 --> 59:51.065
It's complicated. Complicated?!

59:51.109 --> 59:56.027
That's all you have to say
to me is, "It's complicated"?!

59:56.070 --> 59:58.246
Lizzie.

01:00:01.075 --> 01:00:03.600
Callie's dead.

01:00:11.042 --> 01:00:14.262
I'll tell the kids
the truth. No, you will not.

01:00:14.306 --> 01:00:16.351
I want you out of my house.

01:00:16.395 --> 01:00:18.919
Lizzie, I don't want to see you.

01:00:18.963 --> 01:00:20.573
I don't want
to hear from you again,

01:00:20.617 --> 01:00:22.270
and don't even think about
coming near Jed and Ruby.

01:00:22.314 --> 01:00:24.925
No...
I mean it, Lizzie!

01:00:24.969 --> 01:00:27.711
I want you to go home.

01:00:27.754 --> 01:00:30.191
I don't want to see you.

01:01:00.569 --> 01:01:02.354
Hello?

01:01:02.397 --> 01:01:05.052
Aunt Rose,
Grady wouldn't even look at me.

01:01:05.096 --> 01:01:07.707
I don't blame him,
but... He called me, too.

01:01:07.751 --> 01:01:09.535
What did he say?

01:01:09.578 --> 01:01:11.929
Well, Grady is not too
happy with me, either.

01:01:11.972 --> 01:01:14.758
He thinks I should have
told him myself, and he's right.

01:01:14.801 --> 01:01:18.457
Did he tell you what he's
gonna say to Jed and Ruby?

01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:20.720
This is so awful.

01:01:20.764 --> 01:01:22.722
Yeah, I know.

01:01:30.730 --> 01:01:33.602
Detective Tucker!
Dylan Finch showed up.

01:01:33.646 --> 01:01:35.953
He showed up at Callie's.
He knows I'm alive.

01:01:35.996 --> 01:01:38.346
Did he threaten you
or your family?

01:01:38.390 --> 01:01:41.698
Not exactly, but, yes,
you got to arrest the bastard.

01:01:41.741 --> 01:01:44.701
On what grounds?
We don't have any proof.

01:01:44.744 --> 01:01:46.267
Two people are dead.

01:01:46.311 --> 01:01:48.052
We still need evidence.

01:01:48.095 --> 01:01:50.054
All right, so how do we get it?

01:01:50.097 --> 01:01:51.533
It's risky.

01:01:51.577 --> 01:01:54.406
I don't care.
Let's nail this prick.

01:01:55.755 --> 01:01:59.977
You know, it's not too late
to reconsider.

01:02:00.020 --> 01:02:03.023
Elizabeth, are you listening?

01:02:03.067 --> 01:02:04.372
Should I talk about
giving him the money

01:02:04.416 --> 01:02:05.809
for my family's safety?

01:02:05.852 --> 01:02:09.813
No, being too chatty's
gonna make him suspicious.

01:02:09.856 --> 01:02:11.597
Oh, I'm not sure I can do this.

01:02:11.640 --> 01:02:15.079
Hey, you don't have to.

01:02:15.122 --> 01:02:16.384
Yes, I do.

01:02:16.428 --> 01:02:17.690
I don't see him.

01:02:17.734 --> 01:02:19.692
What I he doesn't show?

01:02:19.736 --> 01:02:22.608
Wait, someone's coming.

01:02:22.651 --> 01:02:24.392
It's not him.

01:02:26.655 --> 01:02:28.527
That's it.
I'm calling this.

01:02:28.570 --> 01:02:29.876
It's been three hours.

01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:31.965
He's not coming.

01:02:35.752 --> 01:02:38.145
Why didn't he show? He may be dead.

01:02:38.189 --> 01:02:40.104
Could have been a setup.
Who knows?

01:02:40.147 --> 01:02:42.584
Well,
what do we do now? He'll show up.

01:02:42.628 --> 01:02:45.283
Unfortunately, it's just not
gonna be on our terms.

01:02:45.326 --> 01:02:47.546
Well, what if he figured
it was a setup?

01:02:47.589 --> 01:02:49.374
My niece and nephew are out
at Lakota Lake with my aunt...

01:02:49.417 --> 01:02:51.202
Stop.
Oh, my God, what if Finch goes there...

01:02:51.245 --> 01:02:52.856
Stop, stop.
We have to get out there.

01:02:52.899 --> 01:02:54.771
Lizzie, stop!
You're working yourself up.

01:02:54.814 --> 01:02:57.904
Look, if it makes you feel
any better, I'm off duty.

01:02:57.948 --> 01:03:00.820
Let's go for a drive.
Come on.

01:03:00.864 --> 01:03:03.214
I can't believe
this is happening.

01:03:03.257 --> 01:03:06.086
He won't hurt your family.
There's no money in it.

01:03:06.130 --> 01:03:07.740
Thank you for doing this.

01:03:07.784 --> 01:03:09.698
Sometimes, you've got
to bend the rules.

01:03:09.742 --> 01:03:11.396
Grady, I know you don't
want to talk to me,

01:03:11.439 --> 01:03:13.615
but please call me.
It's important.

01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.534
Shouldn't you have left
a more detailed message?

01:03:19.578 --> 01:03:21.841
I didn't want to worry him.
He hates me enough already.

01:03:21.885 --> 01:03:23.800
This is going to
push him over the top.

01:03:23.843 --> 01:03:27.238
Yeah, but being vague with Grady
hasn't exactly worked out.

01:03:29.718 --> 01:03:32.373
Look, I'm sorry.
I have no right to judge.

01:03:32.417 --> 01:03:34.723
No, I did a terrible thing.

01:03:34.767 --> 01:03:36.725
That you're trying to correct.

01:03:36.769 --> 01:03:38.902
If I was in your shoes,

01:03:38.945 --> 01:03:40.860
I probably
would have done the same.

01:03:40.904 --> 01:03:42.383
You don't know that.
You're a cop.

01:03:42.427 --> 01:03:43.950
You'd have known
the right thing to do.

01:03:43.994 --> 01:03:47.084
Elizabeth,
given the circumstances,

01:03:47.127 --> 01:03:50.739
there is no right
in this situation.

01:03:50.783 --> 01:03:53.220
But I lied.

01:03:53.264 --> 01:03:56.049
To spare the people you love
incredible pain.

01:04:00.924 --> 01:04:03.274
I should've asked Rose
how the kids were.

01:04:18.506 --> 01:04:21.379
She tries to look tough,
but she's harmless.

01:04:21.422 --> 01:04:23.642
She looks like Ma Barker.

01:04:23.685 --> 01:04:26.210
Detective Tucker, my aunt Rose.

01:04:26.253 --> 01:04:28.603
Ma'am, what do you say
we lower the gun?

01:04:28.647 --> 01:04:30.301
How are the kids?

01:04:30.344 --> 01:04:32.346
Fine.
They're asleep. Any issues?

01:04:32.390 --> 01:04:34.827
Yeah, when they realized
there was no Wi-Fi.

01:04:34.871 --> 01:04:36.611
So I taught them Candy Land.

01:04:36.655 --> 01:04:39.832
Oh, if it's candy,
I like it already.

01:04:39.876 --> 01:04:42.791
Remember, I'm the Candy Land
world inter-galactic champion.

01:04:42.835 --> 01:04:44.489
So, it's your turn!

01:04:44.532 --> 01:04:47.318
Wait, whoa! What's the problem?

01:04:47.361 --> 01:04:49.929
Is that your winning strategy,
to eat all the pieces?

01:04:49.973 --> 01:04:52.323
Hey, hey, it's survival
of the fittest.

01:04:52.366 --> 01:04:54.064
I'm gonna go check on the kids.

01:04:54.107 --> 01:04:55.892
Are you having fun with those?

01:04:55.935 --> 01:04:58.938
What, do these hurt? Ask my husband.

01:04:58.982 --> 01:05:00.200
Ohh. Oooh...

01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:03.203
That's probably Grady.

01:05:07.251 --> 01:05:08.730
Hello?

01:05:08.774 --> 01:05:11.951
Hold on, Grady, hold on.

01:05:11.995 --> 01:05:13.735
Now, there's...
there's a lot to tell.

01:05:13.779 --> 01:05:15.302
But it can wait until tomorrow,

01:05:15.346 --> 01:05:17.304
so please finish your shift,
go to sleep,

01:05:17.348 --> 01:05:19.350
and then come over
tomorrow afternoon.

01:05:19.393 --> 01:05:20.786
Okay, bye.

01:05:20.829 --> 01:05:22.440
All right, ladies,

01:05:22.483 --> 01:05:24.442
I'm gonna take a walk outside,
look around.

01:05:24.485 --> 01:05:26.400
You don't think
this Finch guy is out there?

01:05:26.444 --> 01:05:27.880
No.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:29.882
He may be a killer,
but he's not an idiot.

01:05:29.926 --> 01:05:31.362
It's freezing outside.

01:05:31.405 --> 01:05:32.841
Was that Grady?
What did he say?

01:05:32.885 --> 01:05:36.106
Yeah, um, he's gonna be okay.

01:05:45.898 --> 01:05:47.682
Even if the police arrest Finch,

01:05:47.726 --> 01:05:49.989
it's still a mess,
and it's my fault.

01:05:50.033 --> 01:05:53.210
This is a terrible tragedy,
but there is no way

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:55.647
either of you could have seen
something like this coming.

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.432
But if I hadn't... No,
stop blaming yourself.

01:05:58.476 --> 01:06:01.392
There's no one to blame
but that bastard Finch.

01:06:01.435 --> 01:06:03.002
Yeah, tell that to Grady.

01:06:03.046 --> 01:06:04.961
Grady's a good man.

01:06:05.004 --> 01:06:08.312
Over time, he'll see
the intention of what you did.

01:06:08.355 --> 01:06:09.966
It'll never be
the same between us.

01:06:10.009 --> 01:06:11.315
It won't.

01:06:11.358 --> 01:06:13.926
But it doesn't have to be awful.

01:06:13.970 --> 01:06:16.189
You have been a great aunt
to this kids,

01:06:16.233 --> 01:06:18.452
and you always will be.

01:06:18.496 --> 01:06:20.933
Now, it's your turn.

01:07:07.980 --> 01:07:10.113
Wake up.

01:07:10.156 --> 01:07:13.072
It's just Grady.

01:07:15.074 --> 01:07:17.946
What the hell
are you doing here?

01:07:17.990 --> 01:07:19.252
Grady, you'd better sit down.

01:07:19.296 --> 01:07:20.819
I don't want to sit down.

01:07:20.862 --> 01:07:22.038
I just want to know
what the hell's going on.

01:07:22.081 --> 01:07:23.387
Tucker.

01:07:23.430 --> 01:07:24.692
I thought I made myself clear,
Elizabeth.

01:07:24.736 --> 01:07:26.999
A client invested with our firm.

01:07:27.043 --> 01:07:28.957
The guy that came by my house?

01:07:29.001 --> 01:07:30.263
His name's Dylan Finch.

01:07:30.307 --> 01:07:32.091
Apparently,
he was either skimming

01:07:32.135 --> 01:07:33.614
or laundering dirty money,

01:07:33.658 --> 01:07:34.963
and when he couldn't
get his hands on the cash,

01:07:35.007 --> 01:07:37.009
he killed Callie
thinking she was me

01:07:37.053 --> 01:07:39.577
as a warning to Jackson
so he would get his money.

01:07:39.620 --> 01:07:42.145
You're saying
that my wife was murdered?

01:07:42.188 --> 01:07:44.712
Shh!
You'll wake the kids. He knows I'm alive.

01:07:44.756 --> 01:07:46.105
That's why he came to the house.

01:07:46.149 --> 01:07:48.151
And now that prick
is coming after my family?

01:07:48.194 --> 01:07:50.892
I've taken care of it. What, are you 
Wonder Woman all of a sudden?

01:07:50.936 --> 01:07:54.244
You've ruined our lives, Lizzie.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:57.247
Guys...

01:07:57.290 --> 01:08:01.686
they found
Dylan Finch's body this morning.

01:08:01.729 --> 01:08:03.557
He's dead?

01:08:03.601 --> 01:08:06.169
Oh, thank God.
Oh, my God.

01:08:06.212 --> 01:08:09.128
Oh, thank God.

01:08:09.172 --> 01:08:11.913
It's over.
- But my wife is still dead!

01:08:11.957 --> 01:08:13.872
It's okay.
Grady...

01:08:13.915 --> 01:08:16.091
No, Elizabeth, this is not okay.
None of this is okay!

01:08:16.135 --> 01:08:18.658
Nothing you say
is gonna bring Callie back.

01:08:18.703 --> 01:08:21.706
Well, let's just... I don't want to hear 
anything that you have to say.

01:08:21.749 --> 01:08:23.099
Somebody has to explain
to my kids

01:08:23.142 --> 01:08:24.535
what happened to their mother.

01:08:24.578 --> 01:08:25.840
And this is on you.

01:08:25.884 --> 01:08:28.060
I don't want to see you again.

01:08:28.104 --> 01:08:29.930
And I don't want my kids
seeing you when they get up.

01:08:29.975 --> 01:08:32.846
Now, hold on.

01:08:32.890 --> 01:08:36.502
Your sister-in-law
risked her life yesterday...

01:08:36.546 --> 01:08:38.417
to protect you and your family.

01:08:38.462 --> 01:08:39.941
Daddy?

01:08:39.984 --> 01:08:42.466
I want you out of here now.

01:08:46.296 --> 01:08:48.471
I'm coming, sweetheart.

01:08:56.697 --> 01:08:59.135
He was out of line. No, he's right.

01:08:59.178 --> 01:09:01.224
When my parents died,
I was lost.

01:09:01.267 --> 01:09:03.573
Now Callie's gone, too.
I'm alone.

01:09:07.011 --> 01:09:09.188
And I have no one.

01:09:09.232 --> 01:09:10.667
I don't blame Grady.

01:09:18.631 --> 01:09:21.026
She slept with me, Rose,
while Callie's ly...

01:09:21.069 --> 01:09:22.854
I know, I know.

01:09:22.897 --> 01:09:24.812
That was wrong.

01:09:24.856 --> 01:09:28.685
That was a terrible thing to do.

01:09:28.729 --> 01:09:31.078
I have to tell my kids
their mother is dead

01:09:31.122 --> 01:09:34.212
and that their aunt's been
pretending to be their mom?

01:09:34.256 --> 01:09:36.475
I know.

01:09:40.350 --> 01:09:42.961
You said that you never
want to see her again.

01:09:43.004 --> 01:09:46.399
And that you never want
the children to speak to her.

01:09:46.443 --> 01:09:49.533
But are you sure this is
what you want for your kids?

01:09:49.576 --> 01:09:51.665
And for you?

01:09:54.364 --> 01:09:57.671
I don't know
if I can forgive her.

01:09:57.715 --> 01:10:01.980
You have to remember,
she has lost a sister,

01:10:02.023 --> 01:10:05.549
her partner,
and her life as she knows it.

01:10:08.334 --> 01:10:11.119
What would Callie say?

01:10:11.163 --> 01:10:12.773
That's low.

01:10:12.817 --> 01:10:14.732
Maybe.

01:10:16.212 --> 01:10:18.649
But those children...

01:10:18.692 --> 01:10:21.478
they have lost their mother.

01:10:21.521 --> 01:10:23.610
Lizzie means the world to them.

01:10:23.654 --> 01:10:26.744
Do you think this is best
for them if they lose her, too?

01:11:22.365 --> 01:11:24.149
Turn up the music.

01:11:34.986 --> 01:11:36.683
I'd prefer jazz.

01:11:39.338 --> 01:11:41.253
Who are you?

01:11:46.563 --> 01:11:49.348
We have a problem, Elizabeth.
Alexa, turn on...

01:11:49.392 --> 01:11:52.917
Keep the lights off.
It's safer that way.

01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.659
I'm not here to hurt you.

01:11:55.702 --> 01:11:58.357
What are you doing here?

01:11:58.401 --> 01:12:00.490
You know why I'm here.

01:12:00.533 --> 01:12:02.927
Finch worked for you.

01:12:02.970 --> 01:12:06.974
Mm, in a manner of speaking.

01:12:07.018 --> 01:12:09.150
You killed him.

01:12:15.200 --> 01:12:17.681
What do you expect from me?

01:12:17.724 --> 01:12:19.900
I don't have your money.

01:12:22.163 --> 01:12:25.993
I don't like violence,
Elizabeth.

01:12:26.037 --> 01:12:28.344
Violence is messy.

01:12:28.387 --> 01:12:31.129
We're business people.
We can work something out.

01:12:34.480 --> 01:12:36.700
Hey, Elizabeth, it's me.

01:12:36.743 --> 01:12:38.397
Hey, Lizzie.

01:12:42.053 --> 01:12:43.707
Get rid of him.

01:12:47.885 --> 01:12:50.409
I don't want to see you!

01:12:50.453 --> 01:12:52.324
Go away, Avery!

01:12:52.368 --> 01:12:54.587
You shouldn't be here! Look,
I just want us to talk.

01:12:54.631 --> 01:12:57.721
I don't care!
Leave!

01:12:57.764 --> 01:13:00.854
Avery? Damn it, Avery!

01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:02.552
Remember what I told
you would happen

01:13:02.595 --> 01:13:06.077
if you ever
came back here again?!

01:13:06.120 --> 01:13:09.428
Now get outta here!
I mean it!

01:13:09.472 --> 01:13:13.345
Okay, okay, don't call the cops.
I-I'm leaving.

01:13:21.309 --> 01:13:23.311
Yeah, can I speak
to Detective Tucker, please?

01:13:30.971 --> 01:13:33.409
You have 10 days, Elizabeth.

01:13:33.452 --> 01:13:36.716
If not, our next meeti
will be quite different.

01:13:39.763 --> 01:13:41.939
Look, I need you to get over
to Lizzie's immediately.

01:13:41.982 --> 01:13:43.375
I don't know what's going on.

01:13:43.419 --> 01:13:45.377
Just get here
as fast as you can.

01:13:45.421 --> 01:13:47.684
Hurry.

01:13:53.429 --> 01:13:55.169
I'll get you
the money,

01:13:55.213 --> 01:13:57.215
just please
leave my family alone.

01:13:57.258 --> 01:13:59.391
Grady, he's got a gun!

01:14:55.403 --> 01:14:57.580
Hey, it's gonna be okay.

01:14:57.623 --> 01:15:00.191
We're gonna get
out of this, Lizzie.

01:15:00.234 --> 01:15:01.540
Look at me.

01:15:01.584 --> 01:15:03.629
We're gonna get outta here.

01:15:57.248 --> 01:15:59.772
Go.

01:15:59.816 --> 01:16:01.731
Let's go.

01:16:27.583 --> 01:16:29.236
Lizzie, run!

01:17:02.095 --> 01:17:04.054
Drop him,
you son of a bitch!

01:17:07.710 --> 01:17:09.276
Aah!

01:17:25.858 --> 01:17:28.121
This is for Callie.

01:17:40.786 --> 01:17:43.397
Grady, oh, my God, are you okay?

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:46.705
Thank you.

01:17:46.749 --> 01:17:48.402
Thank you.

01:17:48.446 --> 01:17:50.709
You're safe now.

01:18:49.942 --> 01:18:52.379
Did you tell the kids about me?

01:18:55.426 --> 01:18:57.820
No.

01:19:00.474 --> 01:19:02.607
When are you going to?

01:19:09.309 --> 01:19:11.921
Remember when we were teenagers,

01:19:11.964 --> 01:19:14.837
when I first started dating
Callie, you were with, uh...

01:19:14.880 --> 01:19:17.013
Hank Buford.

01:19:17.056 --> 01:19:19.755
Yeah.
That was a mistake.

01:19:19.798 --> 01:19:23.062
We would always go into
that diner on Anderson,

01:19:23.106 --> 01:19:26.457
but never at the same time.

01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:28.546
The waitress thought
we were the same person

01:19:28.589 --> 01:19:30.504
juggling you two guys.

01:19:34.857 --> 01:19:37.033
I do see Callie in you,
you know.

01:19:43.387 --> 01:19:46.520
When my mom died, it was so...

01:19:46.564 --> 01:19:48.261
difficult.

01:19:48.305 --> 01:19:52.570
I just wanted to spare you
and the kids from that pain.

01:19:52.613 --> 01:19:56.400
I don't know
what I was thinking.

01:19:56.443 --> 01:19:58.271
I was willing to do anything,

01:19:58.315 --> 01:20:01.100
even if it meant
sacrificing my life.

01:20:03.189 --> 01:20:07.324
Um, it'll be a sacrifice
being stuck with me.

01:20:09.239 --> 01:20:12.024
I didn't mean it that way.

01:20:12.068 --> 01:20:14.113
I'm sorry, Grady.

01:20:14.157 --> 01:20:15.506
I really am.

01:20:23.514 --> 01:20:26.125
I was afraid that she was
gonna leave me.

01:20:28.911 --> 01:20:31.000
She wasn't happy.

01:20:31.043 --> 01:20:33.176
Maybe, who knows?

01:20:38.964 --> 01:20:41.358
It took
your sister a while, but...

01:20:43.577 --> 01:20:46.319
...I fell in love with her
the very first time

01:20:46.363 --> 01:20:50.497
she kissed me on that dock
right over there.

01:20:50.541 --> 01:20:53.283
You didn't know that was me?

01:20:53.326 --> 01:20:55.198
Are you kidding me?!

01:20:55.241 --> 01:20:57.374
Just messing with you.

01:21:02.031 --> 01:21:04.729
Callie didn't know
what she wanted.

01:21:04.772 --> 01:21:07.123
That's no reflection
on you or the kids.

01:21:07.166 --> 01:21:11.431
She... She didn't know
who she wanted to be.

01:21:11.475 --> 01:21:13.869
That's where we differed.
I do.

01:21:13.912 --> 01:21:16.436
You do?

01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:20.484
It took me 30 years.

01:21:20.527 --> 01:21:23.574
But I swear I know now.

01:21:23.617 --> 01:21:27.534
I want to be there
for Jed and Ruby.

01:21:27.578 --> 01:21:31.712
But only if youwant me to be.

01:21:31.756 --> 01:21:34.324
Just please, no matter what,

01:21:34.367 --> 01:21:36.021
don't cut me out of their lives.

01:21:45.639 --> 01:21:48.816
Are you okay?

01:21:48.860 --> 01:21:50.296
I'm okay, Aunt Rose.

01:21:50.340 --> 01:21:52.298
We're fine.

01:21:58.304 --> 01:22:01.873
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!
Mommy, Mommy!

01:22:01.917 --> 01:22:04.310
Hi!

01:22:04.354 --> 01:22:06.269
Hi.

01:22:06.312 --> 01:22:09.228
What happened, Daddy?

01:22:09.272 --> 01:22:11.143
Are you okay?

01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:13.319
Baby girl,
Daddy's had a little accident,

01:22:13.363 --> 01:22:15.669
but I'm gonna be all right.

01:22:15.713 --> 01:22:18.629
We learned Candy Land!
You did?

01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.722
Look, there's something
I have to tell you.

01:22:24.765 --> 01:22:27.333
You know
I love you both very much.

01:22:27.377 --> 01:22:29.814
And there's nothing
I wouldn't do for you.

01:22:33.035 --> 01:22:35.037
But I need you to know...
Hey, guys, who wants to go fishing?

01:22:35.080 --> 01:22:36.560
Me!

01:22:36.603 --> 01:22:38.649
What are you waiting for?
Grab your pole.

01:22:38.692 --> 01:22:40.607
First one to catch a fish
gets to make some s'mores.

01:22:40.651 --> 01:22:42.218
Well, then,
you're all in trouble

01:22:42.261 --> 01:22:44.002
'cause I'm gonna use
my secret bait.

01:22:44.046 --> 01:22:46.439
Come on! Both: No fair!

01:22:46.483 --> 01:22:47.701
Come on.

01:22:52.315 --> 01:22:54.926
Thank you.
Let's splurge.

01:22:54.970 --> 01:22:58.756
I'm gonna grill the most
expensive steak and lobster.

01:22:58.799 --> 01:23:00.062
You know, I'd be happy

01:23:00.105 --> 01:23:03.239
with just a bowl
of mac and cheese.

01:23:03.282 --> 01:23:05.850
And getting to know you
all over again.

01:23:05.893 --> 01:23:08.287
I have to admit,

01:23:08.331 --> 01:23:11.987
I never really understood
what Callie saw in you.

01:23:12.030 --> 01:23:14.902
But I'm beginning to know
why she fell for you.
