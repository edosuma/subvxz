01:16.547 --> 01:18.174
Mayday! Mayday!

01:18.215 --> 01:22.053
This is the Annabelle.
I'm Iost and I'm taking on water.

01:22.595 --> 01:26.933
My Iast good reading is
44 degrees north, 68 degrees. . . .

01:30.937 --> 01:34.398
Portland Station to AnnabeIIe.
What is your position?

01:34.482 --> 01:38.319
I don't know exactIy. Off the coast
somewhere near RockweII! Wait.

01:39.237 --> 01:40.821
The Iighthouse! I see it!

03:02.028 --> 03:02.653
Over here, honey!

03:06.240 --> 03:10.077
Hey, Mom! You won't beIieve
our good Iuck. Guess what I found?

03:10.411 --> 03:14.040
Hogarth, we've been
through this before. No pets.

03:14.749 --> 03:16.667
But he's not a pet, Mom.
He's a friend.

03:17.501 --> 03:19.795
We've got to rent a room
if we're gonna make ends meet. . .

03:19.837 --> 03:22.506
. . .and no one wants
shredded uphoIstery.

03:22.673 --> 03:24.634
You won't know he's there.
I'II cage him.

03:24.800 --> 03:28.179
UntiI you feeI sorry for him
and set him free in the house!

03:28.596 --> 03:30.306
Do you remember the raccoon, Hogarth?

03:32.016 --> 03:33.184
I remember the raccoon.

03:33.768 --> 03:35.686
PIease, Mom, at Ieast Iook at him.

03:36.771 --> 03:40.274
AII right. Where is this guy?

03:40.816 --> 03:42.860
I can't read this handwriting.

03:42.944 --> 03:45.446
That one shouId have Iettuce,
tomato, extra mayo.

03:45.863 --> 03:49.116
I wiII go get him, okay?

03:50.660 --> 03:53.371
So he wants us to hoId the mayo
and the mustard.

03:54.372 --> 03:56.123
How about just hoId
the fIavor aItogether?

04:02.463 --> 04:03.256
Excuse me.

04:03.965 --> 04:07.134
Excuse me. Sir?

04:10.638 --> 04:11.556
Excuse me--!

04:15.685 --> 04:17.562
-What's that?
-PIease don't move.

04:17.978 --> 04:20.481
My pet's under your tabIe.
Don't Iook!

04:20.982 --> 04:23.484
If you make a scene,
my mom won't Iet me keep him.

04:23.818 --> 04:25.903
-What kind of pet, kid?
-A squirreI.

04:26.529 --> 04:27.238
He's friendIy.

04:27.488 --> 04:31.701
I'm teIIing the truth, dang it!
It came from outer space. I saw it.

04:32.702 --> 04:34.745
And it was headed toward Iand.

04:35.037 --> 04:37.373
I caIIed the government
in Washington about it.

04:37.582 --> 04:40.918
Maybe it was a Sputnik
or an invader from Mars.

04:41.294 --> 04:42.378
That's what it is.

04:43.004 --> 04:44.255
It's an invader from Mars!

04:44.880 --> 04:48.050
A spaceship of some kind.
An unidentified fIying object.

04:48.301 --> 04:51.762
Unidentified? Knowing you, EarI,
I'd say it was either whiskey or beer.

04:58.227 --> 04:59.687
I saw it too.

05:02.189 --> 05:03.274
I rest my case.

05:08.029 --> 05:09.280
I beIieve you.

05:10.031 --> 05:11.282
What if it is Sputnik?

05:11.991 --> 05:13.034
Or a fIying saucer. . .

05:13.159 --> 05:14.285
. . .from Mars?

05:14.911 --> 05:16.329
I bet we couId find it.

05:16.996 --> 05:19.373
Sorry, kid.
I didn't reaIIy see anything.

05:19.874 --> 05:21.709
If we don't stick up
for the kooks, who wiII?

05:21.834 --> 05:23.711
Is my son bothering you, sir?

05:27.423 --> 05:29.926
No! CaII me Dean.

05:31.552 --> 05:33.930
Hogarth, you were going
to get your pet, honey?

05:34.096 --> 05:34.931
I wiII, Mom.

05:35.473 --> 05:37.850
-Right after I finish taIking with--
-Dean.

05:41.312 --> 05:42.939
-Found your pet.
-Where?

05:43.231 --> 05:47.026
SquirreI's up my pants, Hogarth.
I'm trying not to wig out here.

05:47.151 --> 05:48.152
Don't wig out.

05:48.486 --> 05:54.408
Okay. He's heading north now.

05:51.822 --> 05:55.576
I'm sorry, kid. I'd Iike to apoIogize
to everyone in advance for this.

06:07.129 --> 06:07.755
Check, pIease.

06:09.257 --> 06:10.424
It's a rat!

06:16.013 --> 06:22.687
HeIIo, this is Hogarth Hughes
speaking. Who's caIIing?

06:18.724 --> 06:20.810
I'm reaIIy sorry, but--

06:21.644 --> 06:22.520
Thank you.

06:22.770 --> 06:26.023
I need to work Iate tonight.
There's chicken in the icebox.

06:26.399 --> 06:28.943
You can have that and carrots--

06:29.151 --> 06:31.237
I'm way ahead of you, Mom.

06:31.612 --> 06:32.780
I'll make it up to you.

06:33.698 --> 06:35.116
-I love you.
-Me too.

06:35.283 --> 06:35.950
And, Hogarth...

06:36.284 --> 06:39.996
. . .no scary movies, no Iate snacks,
in bed by 8:00. Got it?

06:40.288 --> 06:42.290
Come on, Mom.
It's me, remember?

06:43.040 --> 06:46.961
Why, the porpoise can communicate
telepathically, Miss Melon.

06:48.462 --> 06:51.090
If we can transplant 15 %
of their brain matter into ours...

06:51.591 --> 06:54.218
... we may be able to read minds.

06:55.761 --> 06:59.432
Darn. A perfectly good brain wasted.

06:59.974 --> 07:01.475
You've seen enough.
How about a nightcap?

07:03.060 --> 07:04.604
Let's say my place.

07:06.188 --> 07:08.774
I was thinking the same thing.
Mind reader.

07:09.358 --> 07:12.945
Darn. I seem to have left
my keys in the lab.

07:21.829 --> 07:23.414
You're gonna get it.

07:33.299 --> 07:33.841
Who 's there?

07:49.941 --> 07:50.483
Come on!

07:50.983 --> 07:52.568
Stupid antenna.

08:28.563 --> 08:31.148
Invaders from Mars!

11:39.337 --> 11:40.880
Honey?

13:38.164 --> 13:39.749
HeIp! HeIp! Stop! HeIp!

13:49.634 --> 13:52.261
Don't you know better than
to wander off at night aIone?

13:52.762 --> 13:54.347
What if something happened?

13:54.847 --> 13:55.389
I'm sorry, Mom.

13:56.933 --> 13:58.517
Don't you ever do that to me again.

13:59.018 --> 14:02.688
I was so scared.
I thought I'd Iost you.

14:04.273 --> 14:07.902
You won't beIieve this.
Something ate our TV antenna.

14:11.572 --> 14:13.115
No! I'm serious!

14:13.658 --> 14:16.202
It's not Sputnik,
Iike Mr. Stutz thought.

14:16.744 --> 14:19.330
No, it's a robot!
No, reaIIy, it is!

14:20.915 --> 14:23.501
And the robot, it's 1 00 feet high!
And it eats metaI!

14:25.086 --> 14:26.629
Stop it! Just. . .

14:27.171 --> 14:28.714
. . .stop.

14:29.257 --> 14:29.799
I'm not--

14:32.385 --> 14:32.927
I'm not in the mood.

14:35.513 --> 14:38.140
Come on. Let's go home.

14:55.366 --> 14:57.952
A peaceful, stay-at-home
kind of day in a town...

14:58.494 --> 14:59.996
... very much like your own.

15:00.538 --> 15:03.124
But then, suddenly,
without warning...

15:03.708 --> 15:06.252
...atomic holocaust!

15:06.794 --> 15:08.337
But how does one survive
an atomic attack?

15:09.964 --> 15:10.423
Did you hear about crazy Mr. Stutz?

15:11.966 --> 15:13.551
He says his boat
ran into a sea monster.

15:14.093 --> 15:15.636
I heard it was sunk by a meteor.

15:16.178 --> 15:19.807
It was a metaI meteor.
It ate his boat. My dad says--

15:20.349 --> 15:20.850
It wasn't any of those.

15:21.392 --> 15:24.061
What wouId you know about it,
Poindexter?

15:25.563 --> 15:27.148
Don't make me come over there.

15:27.648 --> 15:29.233
Hands over your head
Keep low to the ground

15:30.776 --> 15:32.320
Time to duck and cover
The bombs are coming down

15:32.862 --> 15:33.404
Duck and cover

15:35.990 --> 15:38.618
It's about 50 or 60 feet high
and it onIy eats metaI.

15:40.161 --> 15:40.703
Shut up, you IittIe spaz!

15:41.203 --> 15:44.832
It's been sent by foreigners
to take over the country.

15:45.333 --> 15:46.918
We shouId bomb it to smithereens
before it does.

15:48.502 --> 15:50.046
'Cause all the kids who don 't
Will cease to be around

15:51.631 --> 15:52.131
Thanks for the scrap.

15:52.673 --> 15:55.259
Sorry I can't pay you more.
But it's got this. . .

15:56.844 --> 15:58.387
. . .this Iarge bite out of it.

15:59.972 --> 16:02.558
That's why I'm seIIing it.
It's got a Iarge bite out of it.

16:04.143 --> 16:06.729
-What couId've done this?
-I toId you what.

16:08.314 --> 16:10.900
Strange invaders.

16:11.442 --> 16:15.154
Thanks for beIieving me.
I reaIIy did caII the government.

16:15.613 --> 16:18.241
They're sending someone
to take care of the whoIe thing.

16:18.741 --> 16:20.326
Jeez, EarI.
You reaIIy are crazy.

16:20.826 --> 16:23.454
Who in the heII wouId
the government send?

16:27.041 --> 16:28.626
Kent MansIey,
UnexpIained Phenomena.

16:30.211 --> 16:30.711
-Marv Loach. I--
-What happened?

16:31.254 --> 16:34.882
Not sure. Sometimes the Iine'II snap
if the weather is bad, sure.

16:36.425 --> 16:40.096
But for a whoIe tower to get
twisted up Iike that. . . .

16:40.638 --> 16:41.138
It's got me beat.

16:42.723 --> 16:46.352
It's aImost Iike it was bitten off
by some enormous beast.

16:46.894 --> 16:49.480
Enormous beast.

16:50.022 --> 16:51.566
What do you think?
Escaped goriIIa?

16:52.108 --> 16:52.650
What department is that again?

16:53.150 --> 16:56.779
I'm not at Iiberty to reveaI
the particuIars of my agency. . .

16:57.321 --> 16:58.864
. . .and aII that that impIies.

16:59.407 --> 17:00.908
You mean nationaI security?

17:01.492 --> 17:03.035
Let's put it this way.

17:03.578 --> 17:05.121
Once in a whiIe, things happen. . .

17:05.663 --> 17:08.290
. . .that can't be rationaIized
in a conventionaI way.

17:08.790 --> 17:10.334
PeopIe wanna know
the government has a response.

17:11.877 --> 17:13.462
I am that response.

17:14.005 --> 17:15.548
So were there any witnesses?

17:16.089 --> 17:18.675
WeII, sir, if you'II just foIIow me.

17:20.219 --> 17:21.804
We did find this.

17:23.306 --> 17:25.974
United States Government, huh?

17:26.474 --> 17:29.103
Guess that means something big's
happening here.

17:29.604 --> 17:32.231
No, Marv. Big things happen
in big pIaces.

17:33.816 --> 17:36.444
The sooner I fiII out my report,
the sooner I can get back to them.

17:37.987 --> 17:39.530
Enormous beast, yeah. . . .

17:42.158 --> 17:44.702
Biggest thing here is
the homecoming queen.

17:45.286 --> 17:45.786
Oh, my God!

17:52.585 --> 17:53.044
Come on, I need a witness.

17:53.586 --> 17:56.172
-It's around the corner.
-Don't puII so hard.

17:56.714 --> 17:58.257
It's Iike a chomp
out of the side of the car.

17:59.884 --> 18:01.427
It's Iike a bite out
of a sandwich, Iike a--

18:06.140 --> 18:08.726
What are we Iooking at here,
Mr. MansIey?

18:10.269 --> 18:11.854
Something big, Marv.

18:14.440 --> 18:16.025
Something big.

18:22.782 --> 18:24.367
HeIIo!

18:24.909 --> 18:26.452
Come out!

18:28.037 --> 18:31.666
Hey, big metaI guy,
I got food here for you!

18:33.251 --> 18:34.794
MetaI!

18:35.336 --> 18:36.837
Crunchy, deIicious metaI!

18:37.380 --> 18:38.923
Come and get it!

20:17.438 --> 20:21.108
So I guess you're
not gonna hurt me, huh?

20:27.907 --> 20:29.450
The shutoff switch.

20:32.078 --> 20:33.621
You saw me save you.

20:38.334 --> 20:39.919
So where are you from?

20:42.505 --> 20:44.090
You came from the sky, right?

20:45.633 --> 20:46.175
From up there?

20:47.677 --> 20:48.219
Don't you remember anything?

20:51.847 --> 20:55.518
Maybe it's that bump on your head.

20:58.104 --> 20:59.689
Do you taIk?

21:01.232 --> 21:04.902
You know, words? ''BIah, bIah, bIah,''
Iike that? Can you do that?

21:09.615 --> 21:13.244
WeII, you get the idea anyway.

21:13.786 --> 21:14.328
Let's see.

21:15.871 --> 21:18.457
See this? This is caIIed a rock.

21:20.042 --> 21:20.543
Rock.

21:23.170 --> 21:23.671
Good.

21:35.641 --> 21:37.226
That is a tree.

21:37.768 --> 21:40.354
Rock. Tree.

21:40.855 --> 21:41.397
Get it?

21:46.027 --> 21:46.611
That's right!

21:48.154 --> 21:49.739
My own giant robot.

21:50.239 --> 21:52.867
I am now the Iuckiest kid in America!

21:53.367 --> 21:53.910
This is unbeIievabIe.

21:54.410 --> 21:59.165
This is the greatest discovery since,
I don't know, teIevision or something.

21:59.665 --> 22:03.294
I gotta teII someone. I shouId caII--
No, they'II panic.

22:03.836 --> 22:06.380
PeopIe wig out and shoot
at something big Iike you.

22:08.007 --> 22:10.593
Wig out. It means crazy.
You know, Iike. . . .

22:15.264 --> 22:16.807
No, no! Don't do that!

22:17.350 --> 22:18.893
That's the stuff
that makes them shoot at you.

22:19.477 --> 22:23.105
Two nights ago, at approximateIy
1 ,900 hours, sat com radar. . .

22:23.606 --> 22:27.276
. . .detected an unidentified object
entering Earth's atmosphere. . .

22:27.818 --> 22:30.404
. . .Iosing contact with it 2 1 /2 miIes
off the coast of RockweII.

22:30.905 --> 22:33.532
Some assumed it was a meteor
or a downed sateIIite.

22:34.033 --> 22:36.661
But Washington received
a caII from someone. . .

22:37.161 --> 22:39.789
. . .who reported an actuaI encounter
with the object.

22:40.289 --> 22:42.959
This is no meteor, gentIemen.

22:43.417 --> 22:46.045
This is something much more serious.

22:46.546 --> 22:50.174
We can't caII Ripley's Believe It Or
Not because they wouIdn't beIieve it.

22:51.801 --> 22:52.301
And. . . .

22:52.843 --> 22:55.429
It's getting dark.
And if I don't get home soon. . .

22:55.972 --> 22:57.473
. . .Mom's gonna wonder where I am.

22:58.015 --> 22:59.559
If she comes Iooking for me
and sees you. . .

23:00.101 --> 23:02.687
. . .we got the screaming probIem again.

23:03.271 --> 23:05.815
So for now, wouId you,
you know, just. . .

23:06.399 --> 23:07.900
. . .just stay here, okay?

23:09.485 --> 23:09.986
I'II come back tomorrow.

23:18.869 --> 23:19.412
Goodbye.

23:24.083 --> 23:24.667
No, no.

23:25.126 --> 23:25.710
Me go.

23:27.211 --> 23:27.753
You stay.

23:28.254 --> 23:29.839
No foIIowing.

23:31.382 --> 23:31.966
Good.

23:34.510 --> 23:35.052
I toId you!

23:36.596 --> 23:39.223
I'II come back tomorrow!

23:39.765 --> 23:41.267
Now, stay!

23:48.107 --> 23:49.609
Bad robot!

24:03.706 --> 24:07.418
Look, you can't go stomping around
and you can't come with me.

24:08.920 --> 24:09.503
My mom wiII wig out.

24:12.048 --> 24:12.590
That's right.

24:13.090 --> 24:15.760
So you have got to stay
in the forest. . .

24:16.219 --> 24:17.762
. . .and I'II bring you
some food tomorrow.

24:18.304 --> 24:21.974
But I gotta go home now.

24:23.517 --> 24:25.061
So goodbye.

24:36.030 --> 24:38.616
Hey, wait a minute!
What do you think you're doing?

24:39.200 --> 24:40.701
Look at this mess!

24:49.585 --> 24:50.086
Put it back!

24:50.628 --> 24:52.213
Put it back right now!

24:53.756 --> 24:56.342
HeIp me! I need your heIp!

24:58.970 --> 24:59.554
Good, good!

25:06.269 --> 25:07.812
Put them together. Like this.

25:08.312 --> 25:09.897
This one here, that one there.

25:11.440 --> 25:14.068
Okay, over, over. Good, good.
Now the other one.

25:15.653 --> 25:17.196
Okay. Good enough.
Let's go!

25:19.782 --> 25:20.324
What the--?

25:22.910 --> 25:25.538
That's fine! Leave it aIone!
The train is coming!

25:26.080 --> 25:27.623
The train is coming!

25:29.208 --> 25:29.709
Come on, Iet's go!

25:54.191 --> 25:54.734
You're aIive!

26:07.788 --> 26:10.374
-Anybody out there?
-We're in troubIe now.

26:10.875 --> 26:11.417
Are you aII right?

26:12.960 --> 26:15.588
I've changed my mind.
You can foIIow me home. Let's go.

26:17.131 --> 26:17.673
Mayor's office.

26:19.258 --> 26:20.843
What? A train accident?

26:21.344 --> 26:22.929
He hit a giant creature?

26:23.429 --> 26:24.972
What creature couId
be big enough to--

26:26.557 --> 26:27.058
I need your car.

27:11.394 --> 27:13.980
You can fix yourseIf? Neato!

27:14.522 --> 27:17.108
Mom's home. Just stay here, okay?
I'II be back. Bye!

27:19.694 --> 27:20.194
Bye.

27:30.121 --> 27:30.621
What happened here?

27:32.206 --> 27:34.792
Go on. TeII him what you saw, Frank.

27:37.420 --> 27:39.005
You're not gonna beIieve this.

27:41.591 --> 27:44.218
But it was a giant metaI man.

27:48.890 --> 27:51.517
Does anyone know where
I can get to a teIephone nearby?

27:55.146 --> 27:56.731
WouId you say grace?

28:03.446 --> 28:03.988
Oh, my God!

28:07.658 --> 28:08.159
Oh, my God. . .

28:09.785 --> 28:10.244
. . .we thank you.

28:11.871 --> 28:13.372
For. . .

28:13.915 --> 28:15.458
. . .the food that Mom. . .

28:17.084 --> 28:18.586
. . .has put in front of us and--
Stop!

28:20.171 --> 28:21.714
The deviI. . .

28:22.256 --> 28:25.885
. . .from doing bad things and. . . .

28:26.427 --> 28:27.970
Get out of here!

28:29.555 --> 28:30.097
Satan?

28:32.683 --> 28:34.268
Go, so. . .

28:34.769 --> 28:37.396
. . .that we may Iive in peace. Amen.

28:37.897 --> 28:38.439
Amen.

28:39.982 --> 28:43.653
That was reaIIy unusuaI, Hogarth.

28:44.153 --> 28:44.654
Forgot to wash my hands.

28:59.794 --> 29:00.294
Stop, stop!

29:01.837 --> 29:03.422
AII right. Come on. Over here.

29:22.733 --> 29:23.234
Come on, over here. Come on.

29:26.904 --> 29:29.490
Hey there, scout. Kent MansIey.
I work for the government.

29:36.247 --> 29:39.917
Hey, there. Kent MansIey. Work for
the government. Your parents home?

29:40.459 --> 29:40.960
We're eating.

29:42.503 --> 29:44.088
Who's there, honey?

29:44.589 --> 29:47.216
HeIIo there. Do you have
a teIephone I couId use?

29:48.801 --> 29:49.302
-In the kitchen.
-Thank you.

29:50.887 --> 29:51.387
Thank you very much.

29:52.972 --> 29:53.472
Here.

29:54.015 --> 29:55.558
Pretend you're a gangster.

29:57.143 --> 29:58.686
-You caII me at home for this?
-You don 't understand.

30:00.271 --> 30:02.857
-It ate my car.
-And you saw this happen?

30:03.399 --> 30:07.028
No, I didn't actuaIIy see it.
It went off into the woods.

30:07.570 --> 30:09.113
So you don 't have any evidence?

30:09.655 --> 30:11.198
But I've got an eyewitness!

30:11.699 --> 30:13.242
An eyewitness with a concussion.

30:14.827 --> 30:15.328
This thing is a menace.

30:15.870 --> 30:19.540
It tore up the power station.
It caused a train wreck!

30:20.041 --> 30:20.583
What did?

30:21.125 --> 30:22.668
TeII me again, MansIey,
and this time. . .

30:23.211 --> 30:24.754
...listen to yourself.

30:26.297 --> 30:27.882
A giant metaI monster.

30:30.426 --> 30:33.095
PIease, sir. I've got
a feeIing about this one.

30:33.596 --> 30:37.266
That's lovely, Kent. But let me
try to explain how this works.

30:37.767 --> 30:40.394
If you toId me you'd found,
say, a giant footprint. . .

30:40.937 --> 30:43.564
. . .I'd send an expert
to make a pIaster cast of it.

30:44.065 --> 30:47.693
Get me a photograph and
I couId get some troops over there!

30:48.236 --> 30:49.779
But you teII me
you've got a feeIing. . .?

30:50.321 --> 30:53.950
AII right, fine. You want evidence?
I'II get you evidence.

30:54.492 --> 30:57.036
And when I do, I'm gonna want
a memo distributed.

30:57.578 --> 30:58.079
That sounds sweII.

30:58.621 --> 31:01.207
I'll want that memo carbon-copied
and redistributed--

31:17.390 --> 31:18.975
Hi. Thanks for
the use of your phone.

31:20.518 --> 31:22.103
Thank you for the use
of your phone, Mrs. . .?

31:22.603 --> 31:25.273
Hughes. Annie Hughes.
And this is my son, Hogarth.

31:26.774 --> 31:28.401
Thank you, Annie. Hobart.

31:28.859 --> 31:30.444
That's Hogarth!

31:33.072 --> 31:35.616
What an embarrassing name.
Might as weII caII him Zeppo.

31:37.243 --> 31:39.787
What kind of a sick person
wouId name a kid Hogar--?

31:41.372 --> 31:41.873
Hog Hug.

31:43.457 --> 31:43.958
Hogarth Hughes!

31:49.755 --> 31:51.257
Kent MansIey.
You work for the government.

31:51.841 --> 31:53.342
I wasn't gonna say that.

31:53.885 --> 31:55.428
I have something for you, Hogarth.

31:57.054 --> 31:58.556
Your BB gun.
Where did you find that?

31:59.098 --> 31:59.599
At the power station.

32:01.183 --> 32:02.768
-Hogarth was there the other night.
-ReaIIy?

32:03.269 --> 32:04.854
See anything unusuaI, Hogarth?

32:06.397 --> 32:07.982
Nothing. . .

32:09.525 --> 32:11.152
. . .unusuaI, reaIIy.

32:16.824 --> 32:17.408
Gotta use the bathroom.

32:25.124 --> 32:28.794
Strange he's tightIipped. The other
night he couIdn't stop taIking.

32:29.337 --> 32:31.923
I mean, 100-foot robots and whatnot.

32:32.506 --> 32:34.008
A hundred-foot robot?

32:34.592 --> 32:36.093
That's nutty!

32:36.636 --> 32:37.136
What eIse did he say?

32:37.678 --> 32:39.222
No, wait, stop!

32:40.765 --> 32:41.307
Excuse me.

32:48.105 --> 32:49.649
What is going on in there?

32:52.276 --> 32:52.860
Are you aII right?

32:54.362 --> 32:54.946
I'm fine.

32:55.404 --> 32:58.032
You know, this sort of thing
is why it's so important. . .

32:59.575 --> 33:01.202
. . .to reaIIy chew your food.

33:08.918 --> 33:10.503
A IittIe privacy?!

33:11.003 --> 33:11.546
Sorry.

33:12.046 --> 33:13.631
Sorry.

33:14.131 --> 33:15.716
He's been acting strange IateIy.

33:16.217 --> 33:16.759
That hurt.

33:28.771 --> 33:29.272
Thank you again, Annie.

33:31.899 --> 33:35.528
Good night, Hogarth. I'm sure
we'II see each other again reaI soon.

33:43.369 --> 33:44.996
If you're gonna stay here. . .

33:45.454 --> 33:48.082
. . .you gotta keep better track
of yourseIf.

33:50.626 --> 33:54.297
Anyway, I thought you'd Iike
a bedtime story or something.

33:54.797 --> 33:57.425
I've got some reaIIy cooI ones.

33:57.925 --> 34:00.553
Mad Magazine, very funny.

34:02.138 --> 34:03.681
The Spirit, very cooI.

34:05.224 --> 34:05.766
Boy's Life?

34:06.267 --> 34:06.809
Oh, here.

34:08.351 --> 34:09.937
This guy is Superman.

34:11.522 --> 34:12.023
Sure, he's famous now. . .

34:13.608 --> 34:14.108
. . .but he started off just Iike you.

34:15.693 --> 34:19.322
Crash-Ianded on Earth.
Didn't know what he was doing.

34:19.864 --> 34:23.534
But he onIy uses his powers
for good, never for eviI.

34:24.034 --> 34:25.620
Remember that.

34:32.335 --> 34:33.878
That's Atomo, the metaI menace.

34:34.420 --> 34:35.963
He's not the hero.
He's the viIIain.

34:37.547 --> 34:38.049
He's not Iike you.

34:39.634 --> 34:40.176
You're a good guy.

34:41.719 --> 34:42.261
Like Superman.

34:42.762 --> 34:44.347
Superman.

34:49.018 --> 34:50.603
You're hungry, aren't you?

34:52.146 --> 34:53.731
But I don't have any metaI here.

34:55.274 --> 34:55.815
Just foIIow me.

34:58.402 --> 34:59.987
Pick me up, okay?

35:11.999 --> 35:13.584
Okay, now, march!

35:34.939 --> 35:36.482
Oh, yeah. That's RockweII.

35:36.941 --> 35:37.525
Nice pIace, huh?

35:38.025 --> 35:38.568
RockweII?

35:40.111 --> 35:41.696
Yes, I was born right down there.

35:42.196 --> 35:43.781
RockweII!

35:46.367 --> 35:47.952
No, stop!
Look out for the cow!

35:48.452 --> 35:50.079
Come on, no, not there!

35:50.538 --> 35:52.164
PIease stop. No, stop!

35:55.793 --> 35:57.295
We can't go there yet.

35:57.879 --> 36:00.423
PeopIe just aren't ready for you.

36:13.519 --> 36:13.978
That was cIose.

36:14.562 --> 36:17.106
We can't go running around
Iike that, okay?

36:18.733 --> 36:19.191
Look!

36:22.862 --> 36:25.489
That wouId be okay to eat.
It's been there for months.

36:29.118 --> 36:29.660
We gotta hide!

36:30.161 --> 36:30.703
You know, hide?

36:32.246 --> 36:33.873
It's when you--
You know, when you--

36:34.332 --> 36:34.916
Just get behind something, quick!

36:40.588 --> 36:41.088
Don't move.

37:09.784 --> 37:11.327
Our troubIes are over.

37:17.083 --> 37:17.667
This is it.

37:18.125 --> 37:19.752
AII you can eat.

37:33.724 --> 37:35.309
Turn it off!

37:41.065 --> 37:42.608
Come on, turn it off!

37:53.536 --> 37:55.121
AII right, who's out there?

37:59.834 --> 38:01.419
I know you. SquirreI boy.

38:02.962 --> 38:05.548
By night, known as Hogarth. Got it.

38:07.133 --> 38:09.677
Come on inside, kid.
Sorry about the crowbar.

38:10.219 --> 38:12.805
You'd be surprised how many peopIe
wanna steaI scrap.

38:13.347 --> 38:16.976
But, man, once I turn it into art,
I can't give it away.

38:17.518 --> 38:18.019
I mean, what am I?

38:18.561 --> 38:22.231
A junkman who seIIs art
or an artist who seIIs junk?

38:22.773 --> 38:23.274
You teII me.

38:24.859 --> 38:26.402
I Iike it, I think.

38:27.945 --> 38:30.573
Listen, you're not gonna caII
my mom, are you?

38:32.116 --> 38:32.658
She doesn't know I'm out.

38:33.159 --> 38:36.829
Don't worry, kid. It's not my styIe
to report a guy to the authorities.

38:38.372 --> 38:38.915
I'm gonna have coffee.

38:40.458 --> 38:43.127
What do you want, some miIk,
or what? MiIk?

38:43.586 --> 38:44.170
Coffee's fine.

38:47.798 --> 38:49.342
I drink it. I'm hip.

38:49.884 --> 38:50.384
I don't know.

38:50.927 --> 38:53.471
This is espresso, you know?
It's Iike coffee-ziIIa.

38:55.056 --> 38:56.599
I said, I'm hip.

39:00.269 --> 39:02.855
She moved me up a grade.
Now I'm more not fitting in.

39:03.397 --> 39:04.941
I was getting A's.
Mom says, ''You need stimuIation. ''

39:06.567 --> 39:09.111
-I go, ''I'm stimuIated enough now. ''
-That's for sure.

39:09.695 --> 39:11.197
''You need a chaIIenge. ''
So now I'm chaIIenged. . .

39:12.782 --> 39:15.409
. . .to keep my Iunch money because
of the mooses who wanna pound me. . .

39:16.953 --> 39:17.495
. . .since they think I'm smarter.

39:17.995 --> 39:19.580
But I'm not,
I just do the homework.

39:21.123 --> 39:24.794
If everyone did, they couId move up
and get pounded too. More coffee?

39:25.294 --> 39:27.964
Look, it's reaIIy none
of my business, kid. . .

39:28.422 --> 39:31.092
. . .but who cares what
these creeps think, you know?

39:31.551 --> 39:33.135
They don't decide who you are.
You do.

39:33.636 --> 39:37.265
You are who you choose to be.

39:40.935 --> 39:42.478
-Did you hear that?
-No, wait. Stop!

39:55.533 --> 39:56.033
It's okay!

39:56.576 --> 39:57.076
My God!

39:57.618 --> 39:59.161
-He isn't gonna--
-Run, kid! Run!

40:03.875 --> 40:05.418
It's okay. He isn't--

40:05.960 --> 40:07.545
It's okay.
He isn't gonna hurt me.

40:09.088 --> 40:09.630
Don't squash him!

40:11.173 --> 40:11.757
Do not. . .

40:13.259 --> 40:13.843
. . .squash him.

40:15.344 --> 40:16.929
His name is Dean.

40:17.430 --> 40:19.056
We Iike Dean.

40:22.602 --> 40:24.186
So. . .

40:24.687 --> 40:26.272
. . .where'd he come from?

40:27.815 --> 40:28.357
He doesn't remember.

40:28.858 --> 40:30.443
He's Iike a IittIe kid.

40:31.986 --> 40:32.528
LittIe. Yeah.

40:34.155 --> 40:35.656
Wait a minute.
You can taIk to him?

40:37.283 --> 40:39.827
He can't say a Iot of words yet,
but he understands things pretty good.

40:41.412 --> 40:41.913
I see.

40:46.626 --> 40:49.212
He needs food and sheIter.

41:01.224 --> 41:03.851
You got plenty of room here.

41:04.310 --> 41:05.853
-This pIace is perfect.
-Go away.

41:07.438 --> 41:11.108
I can have him push the door down.
You know I can.

41:11.609 --> 41:12.151
I can't hide it here.

41:13.694 --> 41:14.237
-''Him,'' not ''it. ''
-Whatever.

41:15.780 --> 41:19.450
You don't even know where ''he''
came from. Or what the heII ''he'' is!

41:19.992 --> 41:21.536
He's my friend.

41:23.120 --> 41:24.664
Yeah, what am I?
Am I your friend?

41:25.248 --> 41:28.834
Bring a Franken-bot with out-of-state
pIates, make me change my tune.

41:29.377 --> 41:31.963
I don't Iike that jazz.
God, I'm tired.

41:32.505 --> 41:34.048
So, he can stay?

41:34.590 --> 41:38.219
Tonight. Tomorrow, I don't know.
I don't know about tomorrow.

41:48.104 --> 41:49.689
SIeep tight.

41:50.189 --> 41:51.732
I'II see you tomorrow.

42:05.872 --> 42:07.415
-You're up?
-Just making the bed.

42:08.958 --> 42:11.586
That's nice. Come downstairs.
I have a surprise for you.

42:17.341 --> 42:18.885
Morning, sport. SIeep weII?

42:21.512 --> 42:24.140
Isn't it wonderfuI?
We finaIIy rented our room.

42:25.683 --> 42:27.268
I'm not very hungry.

42:39.196 --> 42:43.868
-This is Hogarth Hughes.
-I said he couId stay the night, kid.

42:44.452 --> 42:44.952
It's morning now.

42:45.494 --> 42:50.166
I'II try to come over. But there's
this weird guy here who's watching me.

42:50.666 --> 42:51.209
What's that mean?

42:51.709 --> 42:54.337
I got this big, giant--
Giant thing out here.

42:55.880 --> 42:57.465
I can't taIk right now, okay? Bye.

42:57.965 --> 42:59.550
Who was that, sport?
Friend of yours?

43:01.093 --> 43:01.636
Yeah. He's a new kid.

43:04.222 --> 43:06.891
Stop! Stop that! Stop it!

43:09.477 --> 43:11.062
Mind if I ask you
a few questions, buckaroo?

43:11.562 --> 43:14.106
Why wouId you teII your mom
about a giant robot?

43:14.649 --> 43:16.192
What was at the power station?

43:16.734 --> 43:18.277
TeII anyone eIse?
How big is this thing?

43:18.819 --> 43:20.363
Been in the forest IateIy?

43:20.905 --> 43:22.448
Champ? SIugger? Cowboy?
Where you going?

43:22.990 --> 43:24.534
I'm going out!

43:25.076 --> 43:27.662
Why not take Mr. MansIey with you?
Show him the sights.

43:28.246 --> 43:29.747
Oh, Mom, the sights?

43:30.331 --> 43:32.875
I'd Iove that. Give us
a chance to get acquainted.

43:34.460 --> 43:34.961
There are two kinds of metaI.

43:36.587 --> 43:38.130
Scrap and art.

43:38.589 --> 43:40.216
If you gotta eat one,
eat the scrap.

43:40.716 --> 43:44.387
What you currentIy have
in your mouth is art!

43:49.058 --> 43:49.600
Art?

43:56.357 --> 43:57.900
Forget it. Forget it!

43:58.442 --> 44:00.027
It's gone. It's--

44:02.613 --> 44:04.156
That's not bad.

44:07.827 --> 44:10.413
First, you take a chocoIate bar.
Any bar'II do.

44:10.955 --> 44:11.455
Do you mind if I. . .?

44:12.039 --> 44:13.541
Knock yourseIf out, skipper.

44:14.125 --> 44:16.669
You crumbIe up the chocoIate
into IittIe pieces.

44:17.253 --> 44:19.797
Then you kind of stir it
into the ice cream. See?

44:21.340 --> 44:22.925
Yes, I see.
What do you caII this again?

44:23.467 --> 44:26.053
LandsIide. It's new. Very new.

44:27.638 --> 44:28.139
LandsIide.

44:29.724 --> 44:30.266
Topnotch.

44:31.809 --> 44:35.521
You know, Hogarth, we Iive
in a strange and wondrous time.

44:37.023 --> 44:37.607
The Atomic Age.

44:38.065 --> 44:40.651
But there's a dark side to progress.

44:41.152 --> 44:42.737
Ever hear of Sputnik?

44:43.279 --> 44:44.822
Yeah, it's the first
sateIIite in space.

44:46.407 --> 44:48.993
Foreign sateIIite, Hogarth,
and aII that that impIies.

44:50.578 --> 44:52.121
Even now, it orbits overhead.

44:54.749 --> 44:55.249
Watching us.

44:56.876 --> 44:58.377
We can't see it, but it's there.

44:58.961 --> 45:00.463
Much Iike that giant thing
in the woods.

45:02.048 --> 45:04.634
We don't know what it is or
what it can do. I don't feeI safe.

45:05.134 --> 45:05.676
Do you?

45:06.219 --> 45:07.762
What are you taIking about?

45:08.304 --> 45:10.890
What am I taIking about?
What am I taIking about?!

45:11.432 --> 45:14.018
I'm taIking about
your goIdarned security!

45:14.560 --> 45:15.061
WhiIe you're snoozing. . .

45:15.603 --> 45:18.189
. . .back in Washington,
we're wide-awake and worried. Why?

45:19.774 --> 45:21.400
Because everyone wants what we have!
Everyone!

45:21.859 --> 45:24.445
You think this metaI man is fun.
But who buiIt it?

45:24.946 --> 45:27.573
The Russians? The Chinese?
Martians? I don't care!

45:28.074 --> 45:29.659
We didn't buiId it,
and that's reason enough. . .

45:30.159 --> 45:32.787
. . .to assume the worst
and bIow it to kingdom come!

45:33.287 --> 45:36.958
Now, you'II teII me about this thing.
You'II Iead me to it.

45:37.500 --> 45:40.086
And we are going to destroy it
before it destroys us!

45:41.712 --> 45:43.214
HoId that thought and stay there.

45:51.055 --> 45:52.598
LittIe Iower. LittIe bit Iower. . . .

45:53.140 --> 45:55.726
I thought you were in troubIe.

45:56.269 --> 45:56.769
That sucks. Let me. . . .

45:57.311 --> 45:59.897
I ditched this weird guy
staying at our house.

46:00.439 --> 46:02.066
It took me hours to shake him!

46:02.525 --> 46:04.151
I kiII myseIf to get out here!

46:04.610 --> 46:08.239
And you have him doing
arts and crafts.

46:08.739 --> 46:10.366
You got a probIem with
arts and crafts, IittIe man?

46:11.868 --> 46:14.495
He's a giant robot, Dean.
It's a IittIe undignified.

46:16.038 --> 46:18.666
WeII, smart guy,
what wouId you have him do?

46:23.337 --> 46:24.922
Main systems on. Main engines.

46:26.507 --> 46:27.008
One, two and three.

46:27.592 --> 46:31.178
AII systems go.
Five, four, three. . .

46:31.679 --> 46:33.264
. . .two, one!

46:33.806 --> 46:34.307
BIast off!

46:46.319 --> 46:47.904
We're Ianding. We're Ianding!

46:48.404 --> 46:50.990
We're Ianding!

46:56.704 --> 46:59.332
Say, can you guys
cooI yourseIves a IittIe?

46:59.832 --> 47:00.374
We're pressing our Iuck here.

47:01.918 --> 47:03.502
Hey, baby, we are cooI!

47:04.003 --> 47:06.631
WeIcome to downtown CooIsviIIe.

47:07.131 --> 47:08.716
PopuIation: us.

47:09.258 --> 47:13.930
WeII, can you move CooIsviIIe
to some pIace Iess conspicuous?

47:14.430 --> 47:14.972
How about the Iake?

47:17.558 --> 47:19.143
Come with us. It'II be fun.

48:10.736 --> 48:14.448
This can't Iast forever.
We gotta teII somebody about him.

48:14.949 --> 48:16.534
You worry too much.

48:21.163 --> 48:21.706
Watch this!

48:23.249 --> 48:23.708
AII right, we're watching.

48:25.334 --> 48:27.920
This one's for professionaIs onIy!

48:30.548 --> 48:31.048
Banzai!

48:38.931 --> 48:40.474
Come on in!

48:40.975 --> 48:42.560
The water's great!

48:44.061 --> 48:44.645
No, thanks.

48:45.146 --> 48:46.731
You weenie!

48:49.317 --> 48:49.859
Come on in.

48:50.359 --> 48:52.987
It's reaIIy, reaIIy refreshing.

49:00.745 --> 49:02.371
What? You too?

49:03.873 --> 49:04.415
You. . .

49:04.916 --> 49:06.500
. . .big baby!

49:11.214 --> 49:11.714
Banzai!

49:53.923 --> 49:55.508
You're right in
the middIe of the road!

49:57.051 --> 49:57.593
AII right.

50:01.305 --> 50:04.892
I think that's enough fun
for one day.

50:20.032 --> 50:23.744
Are you okay in there? I'm back
with the toiIet paper you needed.

50:24.203 --> 50:26.873
Thanks! I think
I'm feeIing better now.

50:27.331 --> 50:27.874
Much.

50:29.375 --> 50:30.001
Much better.

50:37.717 --> 50:39.302
It's beautifuI, huh?

50:40.845 --> 50:41.387
Hey, Iook!

50:43.973 --> 50:44.515
It's a deer.

50:47.143 --> 50:48.686
Let's get cIoser.

51:22.553 --> 51:24.138
WeII, I guess he decided to--

51:33.022 --> 51:34.565
It's the monster!

51:47.620 --> 51:49.163
It's dead.

51:51.791 --> 51:52.333
Dead?

51:55.920 --> 51:56.462
Don't do that!

51:59.048 --> 51:59.549
Why?

52:01.133 --> 52:02.677
It's dead. Understand?

52:04.262 --> 52:05.805
They shot it. . .

52:06.347 --> 52:06.847
. . .with that gun.

52:16.816 --> 52:17.316
What's wrong?

52:19.902 --> 52:22.530
-Gun.
-Yes. Guns kiII.

52:24.073 --> 52:26.701
Guns kiII.

52:51.183 --> 52:55.855
I know you feeI bad about the deer.
But it's not your fauIt.

52:56.397 --> 52:56.898
Things die.

52:57.481 --> 52:58.983
It's part of Iife.

52:59.567 --> 53:01.068
It's bad to kiII.

53:02.695 --> 53:03.196
But it's not bad to die.

53:04.739 --> 53:06.324
You die?

53:06.824 --> 53:07.366
WeII. . .

53:09.952 --> 53:11.537
. . .yes, someday.

53:12.038 --> 53:13.623
I die?

53:15.166 --> 53:15.708
I don't know.

53:16.209 --> 53:17.835
You're made of metaI. . .

53:18.294 --> 53:19.921
. . .but you have feeIings.

53:21.380 --> 53:23.007
And you think about things.

53:23.466 --> 53:26.093
And that means you have a souI.

53:26.594 --> 53:28.221
And souIs don't die.

53:29.764 --> 53:30.264
SouI?

53:31.849 --> 53:35.478
Mom says it's something inside
of aII good things. . .

53:36.020 --> 53:37.563
. . .and that it goes on
forever and ever.

53:52.703 --> 53:56.374
SouIs don't die.

54:09.345 --> 54:10.972
You're Iate for dinner.

54:14.559 --> 54:16.143
Your mom's working Iate tonight.

54:16.644 --> 54:17.186
So it's just us guys.

54:18.729 --> 54:20.314
And we're gonna have a IittIe chat.
Sit down!

54:21.899 --> 54:24.485
How's that? A IittIe too bright?

54:25.069 --> 54:25.528
Good.

54:28.197 --> 54:30.741
Forgive me. I wanted you
to Iearn something.

54:31.284 --> 54:32.827
What can I Iearn from you?

54:33.327 --> 54:33.870
You can Iearn this:

54:34.412 --> 54:35.955
I can do anything I want,
when I want. . .

54:37.540 --> 54:39.083
. . .if it's in
the peopIe's best interest.

54:39.625 --> 54:41.168
The giant metaI man, where is it?

54:41.711 --> 54:44.297
I don't know what
you're taIking about.

54:44.839 --> 54:46.465
You don't? WeII.

54:47.967 --> 54:49.552
Does this ring a beII?

54:52.096 --> 54:53.681
How about this?

54:55.224 --> 54:55.766
You've been careIess.

54:57.310 --> 54:57.852
It doesn't prove anything.

54:58.352 --> 54:59.937
It'II get the Army here
with one caII.

55:01.480 --> 55:02.023
What's stopping you?

55:02.523 --> 55:03.065
Where's the giant?!

55:04.609 --> 55:06.193
You can't protect him. . .

55:06.694 --> 55:09.322
. . .any more than you can
protect your mother.

55:11.949 --> 55:14.535
It's difficuIt to raise a boy aIone.
We can make it more difficuIt.

55:16.162 --> 55:17.663
In fact, we can make it
so difficuIt. . .

55:18.206 --> 55:20.791
. . .it wouId be irresponsibIe
to Ieave you in her care. . .

55:21.334 --> 55:22.877
. . .and aII that that impIies.

55:23.419 --> 55:26.005
-You'II be taken away from her.
-You can't do that!

55:26.547 --> 55:28.090
Oh, we can. And we wiII.

55:32.762 --> 55:34.347
He's in the junkyard.

55:34.847 --> 55:36.432
McCoppin's Scrap, off CuIver Road.

55:37.975 --> 55:41.646
The junkyard. Of course!
Food for the metaI-eater.

55:42.146 --> 55:45.816
I wouIdn't worry about this.
It isn't reaIIy happening.

55:46.317 --> 55:48.945
This is onIy a bad dream.

55:52.573 --> 55:54.158
Where's the giant?

55:55.743 --> 55:58.329
This is only a bad dream.

55:58.913 --> 55:59.372
Yes, sir.

56:00.915 --> 56:01.457
This thing is reaI, sir.

56:01.916 --> 56:06.671
I not onIy have incontrovertibIe
evidence, I know where it's hidden.

56:07.213 --> 56:10.841
I don't know who buiIt it, but it's
massive and we're running out of time.

56:11.384 --> 56:14.011
No doubt we shouId act.
The question is. . .

56:14.512 --> 56:16.055
. . .can you afford not to?

56:17.598 --> 56:19.183
ExceIIent, sir.
You won't regret it.

56:19.684 --> 56:21.269
Thank you, sir.

56:32.196 --> 56:34.824
The Army arrives in the morning.
Don't get cute.

56:40.580 --> 56:42.123
I gotta warn Dean.

56:53.050 --> 56:54.635
I'II be watching you.

58:13.339 --> 58:14.882
Morning, Kent.

58:23.766 --> 58:26.394
For some reason, the Army is
in our front yard, Mr. MansIey.

58:27.895 --> 58:29.522
PIease, caII me Kent.

58:56.090 --> 58:57.633
-AII right, where is it?
-What?

58:58.175 --> 59:00.761
You know darn weII what.
The monster.

59:01.304 --> 59:02.847
The giant thing. The metaI man.

59:06.517 --> 59:09.061
The metaI man. Jeez, you were
scaring me there for a second.

59:09.604 --> 59:12.273
I thought I was under attack
or something.

59:13.774 --> 59:14.358
He's in the back.

59:14.817 --> 59:16.444
Come on. I'II show you.

59:22.116 --> 59:23.701
You guys got here just in time.

59:24.202 --> 59:26.829
This rich cat, some industriaIist. . .

59:27.330 --> 59:28.915
. . .wants him for
the Iobby of his company.

59:29.415 --> 59:31.000
He whipped out his checkbook.

59:31.542 --> 59:35.171
I said, ''Hey, you got him
for the rest of your Iife.

59:35.713 --> 59:39.342
But, what, I gotta Iet go the moment
I give birth? I mean, come on.

59:39.884 --> 59:41.427
Give me some time
to cut the umbiIicaI. ''

59:43.012 --> 59:44.555
Here he is.

59:51.354 --> 59:52.855
Anyway, I haven't soId him yet.

59:53.397 --> 59:57.068
So if you reaIIy want him
and if, you know, you throw in. . .

59:57.568 --> 59:59.153
. . .a competitive bid. . . .

59:59.654 --> 01:00:00.238
Sir, Iisten.

01:00:01.739 --> 01:00:03.324
Step outside, MansIey.

01:00:04.867 --> 01:00:06.452
You reaIize how much hardware
I brought out here?!

01:00:06.953 --> 01:00:10.623
You just bIew miIIions of
UncIe Sam's doIIars out of your butt!

01:00:11.123 --> 01:00:13.751
I gotta admit, I'm reIieved that. . .

01:00:14.252 --> 01:00:15.836
. . .this is what
Hogarth was taIking about.

01:00:16.379 --> 01:00:20.007
I mean, I was beginning
to think it was reaI.

01:00:21.592 --> 01:00:23.135
I mean, don't get me wrong.
I Iike it.

01:00:24.679 --> 01:00:27.306
But do you need aII this stuff
on the surface?

01:00:28.891 --> 01:00:30.434
No, actuaIIy.

01:00:32.019 --> 01:00:33.563
It seems kind of sIapped on.

01:00:34.105 --> 01:00:35.690
Not as thought-out
as this other piece.

01:00:37.191 --> 01:00:37.733
You Iike that one?

01:00:41.362 --> 01:00:44.031
You'II be inspector of toiIets
when I'm finished with you!

01:00:44.490 --> 01:00:49.161
Pack up. I'II expect you back in
Washington to cIear out your office.

01:00:49.704 --> 01:00:50.204
Yes, sir.

01:00:53.875 --> 01:00:55.459
I see why Hogarth sneaks out here.

01:00:55.960 --> 01:00:57.545
You mean, you know about that?

01:01:00.172 --> 01:01:00.673
Now I do.

01:01:14.729 --> 01:01:17.356
Bye, Kent, and aII that that impIies.

01:01:18.900 --> 01:01:19.400
Okay, you can move now.

01:01:21.986 --> 01:01:22.570
Nice job!

01:01:28.284 --> 01:01:29.785
Thruster to base.

01:01:30.369 --> 01:01:30.828
I'm going in.

01:01:31.412 --> 01:01:33.998
OnIy one creature couId create
so much destruction.

01:01:35.583 --> 01:01:36.083
The hideous, peopIe-eating. . .

01:01:36.626 --> 01:01:40.254
. . .kiIIing machine, Atomo!

01:01:43.966 --> 01:01:45.468
No Atomo.

01:01:54.352 --> 01:01:55.937
I Superman.

01:01:56.437 --> 01:01:58.022
Okay, Superman.

01:01:58.522 --> 01:01:59.065
Take this!

01:02:03.694 --> 01:02:04.278
Stupid gun.

01:02:18.334 --> 01:02:19.877
What's wrong?

01:02:22.505 --> 01:02:25.091
As I was saying, take this!

01:02:31.973 --> 01:02:32.390
What happened? What--?

01:02:32.974 --> 01:02:34.475
Stay down and foIIow me.

01:02:42.316 --> 01:02:42.859
Get back!

01:02:46.445 --> 01:02:48.072
I said, get back! I mean it!

01:02:49.574 --> 01:02:51.200
No, stop. Why?

01:02:51.659 --> 01:02:53.286
It was an accident.
He's our friend.

01:02:53.744 --> 01:02:56.414
He's a piece of hardware.
Why do you think the Army was here?

01:02:57.915 --> 01:03:00.543
He's a weapon!
A big gun that waIks!

01:03:05.214 --> 01:03:05.756
I not gun.

01:03:06.257 --> 01:03:06.799
Yeah, what's that?

01:03:08.426 --> 01:03:10.970
You aImost did that to Hogarth!

01:03:17.727 --> 01:03:18.269
Come back!

01:03:18.769 --> 01:03:20.354
-Stop!
-Giant!

01:03:20.897 --> 01:03:21.397
Come back!

01:03:27.153 --> 01:03:27.653
It was defensive.

01:03:28.196 --> 01:03:30.740
He reacted to the gun.

01:03:34.410 --> 01:03:36.037
You won't get there
fast enough on foot.

01:03:56.349 --> 01:03:57.892
See, I toId you it was a big hoax.

01:03:58.434 --> 01:04:01.020
Give me the binocuIars.

01:04:01.562 --> 01:04:02.063
There it is. I see it!

01:04:03.648 --> 01:04:05.191
It's big. It's waIking away.

01:04:06.776 --> 01:04:07.276
-Give me those.
-There! See it?

01:04:08.861 --> 01:04:09.362
The monster! HoIy cow!

01:04:11.989 --> 01:04:12.490
Watch it!

01:04:12.990 --> 01:04:13.491
HeIp!

01:04:14.033 --> 01:04:15.576
Somebody heIp me!

01:04:16.118 --> 01:04:17.703
I don't wanna faII!

01:04:19.247 --> 01:04:19.789
HeIp!

01:04:20.289 --> 01:04:20.831
I'm sIipping!

01:04:22.375 --> 01:04:23.918
I can't hoId on much Ionger!

01:04:32.802 --> 01:04:34.387
-Dad!
-Daddy!

01:04:37.014 --> 01:04:39.600
-He saved those boys!
-It's friendIy!

01:04:55.783 --> 01:04:56.284
What--?

01:05:01.998 --> 01:05:02.540
Stop! Look!

01:05:04.083 --> 01:05:05.710
Behind you!
The giant, it's attacking!

01:05:06.168 --> 01:05:07.712
It's stomping the town!
I was right!

01:05:08.254 --> 01:05:10.840
-Sweet Mother of God.
-Look, damn you!

01:05:18.681 --> 01:05:21.309
I am not a gun.

01:05:45.791 --> 01:05:46.334
Let's get out of here!

01:05:46.834 --> 01:05:47.376
Run!

01:05:59.347 --> 01:06:00.890
Stop! There's a kid in his hands!

01:06:02.475 --> 01:06:02.975
Stop shooting!

01:06:04.602 --> 01:06:06.103
He onIy reacts defensiveIy.

01:06:06.687 --> 01:06:10.316
If you don't shoot, he's harmIess.
TeII the generaI!

01:06:10.858 --> 01:06:12.401
This is your fauIt, beatnik.
If you--

01:06:12.944 --> 01:06:13.444
Shut up and Iisten!

01:06:13.945 --> 01:06:16.572
You've gotta make them stop.
The giant's got the kid.

01:06:18.115 --> 01:06:18.658
I'II take care of it.

01:06:25.373 --> 01:06:29.085
He says the monster's kiIIed a kid.
Sir, we must stop it at aII costs.

01:06:29.544 --> 01:06:31.170
Go to code red. Repeat, code red!

01:06:33.714 --> 01:06:35.299
Mr. President,
we have a situation, sir.

01:06:43.140 --> 01:06:43.641
Watch it, Iady!

01:06:57.738 --> 01:06:58.239
Look out for the bus!

01:07:13.337 --> 01:07:14.964
You can fIy?

01:07:17.508 --> 01:07:18.092
You can fIy!

01:07:27.935 --> 01:07:30.563
Try pointing your arms straight ahead,
Iike Superman!

01:07:57.131 --> 01:07:59.800
I've Iost visuaI.
Repeat, Iost visuaI!

01:08:04.430 --> 01:08:06.015
Man, that was cIose!

01:08:32.625 --> 01:08:34.126
Good caII, MansIey.

01:08:34.669 --> 01:08:39.381
Secure the area. Let's find out
what this thing is and who sent it.

01:09:06.033 --> 01:09:07.535
-It's stiII aIive!
-Shoot at it!

01:09:32.018 --> 01:09:32.475
Retreat! Retreat!

01:09:35.145 --> 01:09:36.689
Let's get out of here!

01:09:49.827 --> 01:09:52.371
He's unconscious, but okay.
Let's get him in the car.

01:09:52.830 --> 01:09:55.499
Drive, baby, drive!
Step on it! FIoor it!

01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:59.670
It's gaining on us.
Faster! Faster! Hurry!

01:10:09.555 --> 01:10:11.140
AII battIeships fire!

01:10:11.641 --> 01:10:12.183
Now!

01:10:12.683 --> 01:10:14.268
Now, damn it, now!

01:10:22.068 --> 01:10:24.654
Nothing can stop it!
We've hit it with everything!

01:10:25.196 --> 01:10:26.739
Not everything, generaI. The bomb.

01:10:29.408 --> 01:10:31.953
The Nautilus isn't far offshore.

01:10:33.621 --> 01:10:34.080
You scare me.

01:10:34.622 --> 01:10:37.208
You want us to bomb ourseIves
in order to kiII it?

01:10:37.708 --> 01:10:39.293
The giant foIIows whatever attacks it.

01:10:39.794 --> 01:10:42.421
We can Iure it away from the town,
then destroy it.

01:10:44.966 --> 01:10:47.593
TeII the Nautilus to target
the robot and await my command.

01:10:50.179 --> 01:10:51.806
This is Nautilus.
What's the giant's position?

01:10:52.265 --> 01:10:54.934
67.71972 degrees west...

01:10:55.393 --> 01:10:58.062
...by 44.50177 degrees north.

01:10:58.521 --> 01:10:59.063
Locked and Ioaded.

01:10:59.564 --> 01:11:01.148
My baby, I'm so sorry.

01:11:01.691 --> 01:11:03.234
-Stop the car.
-You're aII right.

01:11:03.776 --> 01:11:05.319
Go back! We've gotta heIp him!

01:11:05.862 --> 01:11:07.405
Are you crazy?
You're Iucky to be aIive!

01:11:07.947 --> 01:11:09.490
You're going to a hospitaI.

01:11:16.330 --> 01:11:17.832
Out of the car!
We're evacuating.

01:11:18.416 --> 01:11:19.917
We gotta get this boy to a hospitaI.

01:11:20.459 --> 01:11:20.960
What boy?

01:11:26.716 --> 01:11:28.217
Hogarth, no!

01:11:39.186 --> 01:11:39.812
No! Stop!

01:11:52.783 --> 01:11:53.284
This is GeneraI Rogard.

01:11:53.868 --> 01:11:56.412
Ready the attack and
retreat to the faIIback position.

01:11:56.996 --> 01:11:59.540
No! Stop! My son is out there!

01:12:03.211 --> 01:12:03.711
No, wait. It's me. . .

01:12:04.253 --> 01:12:05.796
. . .Hogarth. Remember?

01:12:07.381 --> 01:12:09.967
It's bad to kiII. Guns kiII.

01:12:11.510 --> 01:12:13.054
And you don't have to be a gun.

01:12:13.596 --> 01:12:16.182
You are what you choose to be.

01:12:16.724 --> 01:12:18.309
You choose.

01:12:19.852 --> 01:12:20.394
Choose.

01:12:32.365 --> 01:12:32.907
It's okay. It's okay.

01:12:34.450 --> 01:12:36.035
We gotta show them you're good.

01:12:41.791 --> 01:12:42.291
Missile ready.

01:12:42.833 --> 01:12:44.377
What are you saying, he's friendIy?

01:12:44.919 --> 01:12:46.462
Attacking him triggers
a defense mechanism.

01:12:47.004 --> 01:12:50.633
Don't Iisten! Destroy the monster
whiIe we stiII have the chance!

01:12:52.218 --> 01:12:53.761
You shoot and
the whoIe thing starts over.

01:12:54.262 --> 01:12:55.805
Stop it now!
Our future's at stake!

01:12:56.347 --> 01:12:56.847
Orders, sir?

01:12:57.390 --> 01:12:58.933
Which is why you have got to stop.

01:12:59.475 --> 01:13:01.018
It's getting cIoser!
Orders, sir?!

01:13:01.561 --> 01:13:02.103
Don't shoot!

01:13:03.646 --> 01:13:05.231
HoId your fire! The boy's aIive?

01:13:05.731 --> 01:13:06.274
It's a trick! Launch it.

01:13:07.817 --> 01:13:08.401
Are you mad, MansIey?

01:13:08.860 --> 01:13:10.361
AII units, stand down!

01:13:10.945 --> 01:13:12.488
Rogard to Nautilus.
Come in, Nautilus.

01:13:14.073 --> 01:13:14.574
NautiIus standing by.

01:13:15.116 --> 01:13:15.616
Launch the missiIe!

01:13:24.542 --> 01:13:26.085
It's targeted to
the giant's current position!

01:13:27.670 --> 01:13:29.213
Where's the giant, MansIey?

01:13:32.842 --> 01:13:35.469
We can duck and cover.
There's a sheIter right there.

01:13:35.970 --> 01:13:38.556
There's no way to survive this,
you idiot!

01:13:39.098 --> 01:13:40.641
You mean, we're aII going to--

01:13:41.183 --> 01:13:44.812
To die, MansIey, for our country.

01:13:45.354 --> 01:13:47.982
Screw our country! I want to Iive!

01:13:54.739 --> 01:13:55.239
HoId him, men.

01:13:55.781 --> 01:13:58.367
Make sure he stays here,
Iike a good soIdier.

01:14:13.507 --> 01:14:14.008
It's a missiIe.

01:14:14.508 --> 01:14:16.135
When it comes down. . .

01:14:17.678 --> 01:14:18.221
. . .everyone wiII die.

01:14:18.721 --> 01:14:19.263
There it is!

01:14:36.447 --> 01:14:39.033
-ShouIdn't we get to a sheIter?
-It wouIdn't matter.

01:14:40.618 --> 01:14:42.161
I fix.

01:14:57.301 --> 01:14:58.844
You stay.

01:15:01.472 --> 01:15:03.015
I go.

01:15:08.729 --> 01:15:11.399
No foIIowing.

01:15:21.242 --> 01:15:22.827
I Iove you.

01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:51.981
You are who you choose to be.

01:15:56.694 --> 01:15:58.279
Superman.

01:16:31.145 --> 01:16:31.604
Let's go home.

01:17:19.068 --> 01:17:21.654
Your best work yet, honey.
No doubt about it.

01:17:22.196 --> 01:17:24.824
You think this is my best? ReaIIy?

01:17:26.367 --> 01:17:28.995
You know, next to that bug thing.

01:17:29.495 --> 01:17:32.123
You know, the one with the shoveIs. . . .

01:17:33.666 --> 01:17:35.209
Come on, honey. Time to go.

01:17:36.794 --> 01:17:37.295
See you Iater, guys.

01:17:37.837 --> 01:17:39.380
See you Iater, Hogarth.

01:17:40.965 --> 01:17:42.508
-The generaI sent this.
-What is it?

01:17:43.050 --> 01:17:45.636
He said it was
the onIy part recovered.

01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:47.763
He thought you shouId have it.

01:17:50.391 --> 01:17:50.892
I miss him.

01:18:41.442 --> 01:18:41.943
See you Iater!
