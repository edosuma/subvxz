00:02.536 --> 00:03.437
<i>Previously on</i> East New York...

00:03.537 --> 00:04.805
This is Adam Lustig.

00:04.905 --> 00:06.774
Adam's the major
developer in East New York.

00:06.874 --> 00:07.975
Do me a favor,

00:08.076 --> 00:09.443
play Sherlock Holmes
on your own time.

00:09.543 --> 00:11.412
When people suddenly
become uncooperative,

00:11.512 --> 00:13.214
they usually have
something to hide.

00:13.314 --> 00:14.915
I count three.
No, please.

00:15.015 --> 00:17.218
Please...
One...

00:17.318 --> 00:19.153
Nothing my lawyer
can't handle, Ray.

00:19.253 --> 00:20.454
Nothing my lawyer
can't handle.

00:20.554 --> 00:21.722
Alison Cha is

00:21.822 --> 00:22.990
a very important
addition to our team.

00:23.091 --> 00:24.525
We could have dinner together.

00:24.625 --> 00:26.927
As long as it's not al fresco.

00:27.027 --> 00:28.296
It won't be.

00:28.396 --> 00:29.597
What are you doing here?
You can't force your way

00:29.697 --> 00:31.732
onto church property, Chief.

00:31.832 --> 00:33.301
Make a plate for your brother.

00:33.401 --> 00:35.169
What do I always say?
Family first.

00:35.269 --> 00:36.537
Family last.

00:36.637 --> 00:37.905
I went out to the car

00:38.005 --> 00:39.840
<i>to get my phone,
and I stayed out there,</i>

00:39.940 --> 00:41.509
<i>hoping that if anybody
had to get shot,</i>

00:41.609 --> 00:43.010
it wouldn't be me.

00:43.111 --> 00:44.845
What can I do?

00:44.945 --> 00:46.180
Nothing.

00:46.280 --> 00:48.316
Okay.

00:56.324 --> 00:58.058
<i>If you're training me
to be like you,</i>

00:58.159 --> 00:59.827
<i>why don't you let me drive
every once in a while?</i>

00:59.927 --> 01:01.295
<i>Think fast.</i>

01:02.963 --> 01:04.532
<i>Who's got it better than us?</i>

01:04.632 --> 01:05.999
<i>What's up, man?</i>

01:12.506 --> 01:13.907
<i>Bentley!</i>

01:53.514 --> 01:55.949
Seven-five indoors.

01:56.049 --> 01:57.351
Now, that

01:57.451 --> 01:59.987
is gonna beat anyone that
you go against on Saturday.

02:00.087 --> 02:00.988
How'd I do?

02:01.088 --> 02:02.256
You did good.

02:02.356 --> 02:04.225
That was... That was incredible.

02:04.325 --> 02:05.693
How do you feel?

02:05.793 --> 02:07.027
I feel good. I could definitely

02:07.127 --> 02:08.662
do another event
on Saturday, though.

02:08.762 --> 02:10.798
You're doing the hundred
and the four-by-one.

02:10.898 --> 02:12.466
That's enough
for one meet, Georgia.

02:12.566 --> 02:13.834
Even though she just killed it
in the hundred-meter hurdle?

02:13.934 --> 02:15.669
No, no, no.
No hurdles.

02:15.769 --> 02:17.605
Tanya's been practicing
her hand-off.

02:17.705 --> 02:18.872
She could
definitely run

02:18.972 --> 02:20.574
the third leg
in the four-by-one.

02:20.674 --> 02:22.410
Uh, let us decide
who the top four runners are.

02:22.510 --> 02:23.677
In the meantime,

02:23.777 --> 02:25.246
you girls go
hit the showers.

02:25.346 --> 02:26.814
Nice work.

02:28.282 --> 02:29.617
Is she in the top four?

02:29.717 --> 02:31.952
Not even on her best day.

02:32.052 --> 02:33.153
That settles that.

02:33.254 --> 02:34.522
But I'm just
so glad that I was

02:34.622 --> 02:35.723
able to convince you
to help coach.

02:35.823 --> 02:37.525
Well, my mom used
to help coach me.

02:37.625 --> 02:38.692
I figured it was

02:38.792 --> 02:40.494
a full circle
type thing, you know?

02:40.594 --> 02:42.263
Hey.

02:42.363 --> 02:43.431
What was
my time?

02:43.531 --> 02:45.566
I wasn't timing you.

02:45.666 --> 02:48.402
I was only timing
Georgia, Andre.
No. No.

02:49.737 --> 02:50.838
You did good, man.

02:50.938 --> 02:52.640
Thanks for helping us out.

02:53.574 --> 02:55.676
He single?
Sabrina.

02:56.610 --> 02:57.678
What?

03:33.614 --> 03:34.982
Who is it?

03:35.082 --> 03:36.517
It's me.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.621
Did you
hear that?
Yeah, I called it in.

03:40.721 --> 03:42.256
What, you had to come
check up on me?

03:42.356 --> 03:43.557
If there's
a situation,

03:43.657 --> 03:45.092
there needs to be two
of us responding.

03:45.192 --> 03:46.594
Shots fired at Ruskin Gardens.
Two off-duty members

03:46.694 --> 03:47.695
of the service
wearing rain jackets.

03:47.795 --> 03:48.729

It's 10:30, Cody.

04:19.360 --> 04:20.528
Party time is over.

04:20.628 --> 04:23.030
Okay. Come on, man.

04:23.130 --> 04:24.532
Just come have a
drink or something.

04:24.632 --> 04:25.566
I don't want
nothing to drink, man.

hear the gunshots?

04:47.621 --> 04:49.723
You got no
consideration, Cody.

04:49.823 --> 04:51.224
You got hard-working
people out here

04:51.325 --> 04:52.460
who can't get to sleep.

04:52.560 --> 04:54.462
You got your grandmother
in the room

04:54.562 --> 04:56.229

04:57.831 --> 05:00.368
Yo, my grandma

05:00.468 --> 05:01.969
She sleep
through anything.

05:02.069 --> 05:03.537
I'm gonna tell you
this right now, man.

05:03.637 --> 05:05.839
I got to come out
my apartment one more time,

05:05.939 --> 05:08.742
I'm shutting it down myself.

05:12.846 --> 05:14.715
"Shut it down myself."

Here you go.

05:30.564 --> 05:31.799
It's been cleared.

05:31.899 --> 05:33.401
Young genius thought
it would be funny

05:33.501 --> 05:36.437
to leave the party
and shoot out a streetlight.

05:36.537 --> 05:37.471
Party central was apartment 1-C.

05:37.571 --> 05:38.706
Let's check to see

05:38.806 --> 05:40.173
if anybody there was involved.

05:40.273 --> 05:41.375
Meantime, run him in.

05:46.880 --> 05:48.616
Who is it that lives
in this apartment?

05:48.716 --> 05:50.651
I do.

05:50.751 --> 05:51.785
And you are?

05:51.885 --> 05:53.020
I'm her grandniece.

05:53.120 --> 05:54.622
I live over in building H.

05:54.722 --> 05:56.123
Who was having the party?

05:56.223 --> 05:57.991
That would be
my cousin.

05:58.091 --> 06:00.628
Cody. He's been living here.

06:00.728 --> 06:01.862
Where is he now?

06:01.962 --> 06:04.465
He's probably around
here somewhere.

06:04.565 --> 06:05.599
He can't be

06:05.699 --> 06:07.668
keeping folks up at night.

06:07.768 --> 06:09.870
I already
told him that.

06:09.970 --> 06:13.140
It might be that a police
officer has to tell him that.

06:13.240 --> 06:14.475
There ain't no
need for that,

06:14.575 --> 06:16.009
ma'am. Most times,

06:16.109 --> 06:18.178
when I tell him to do
something, he does it.

06:18.278 --> 06:20.548
All right.

06:20.648 --> 06:22.616
We'll let you get back to sleep.

06:22.716 --> 06:24.418
I get you back in bed,
Aunt Lillie?

06:24.518 --> 06:28.489
Well, didn't turn out to be
much of anything, boss.

06:28.589 --> 06:29.823
Sorry to get you over here.

06:29.923 --> 06:31.024
No, no,
don't be sorry.

06:31.124 --> 06:32.726
When there are
gunshots fired,

06:32.826 --> 06:34.995
and two of my officers
are living there,

06:35.095 --> 06:36.997
I need to know
about it, okay?

06:37.097 --> 06:38.932
Mm-hmm.
All right.

06:39.032 --> 06:41.101
How're you holding up?

06:41.201 --> 06:42.736
Okay. I soaked in
some Epsom salts.

06:42.836 --> 06:44.104
Well, make sure
you get some rest.

06:44.204 --> 06:45.906
Yeah. She's got me running
with these youngsters

06:46.006 --> 06:47.541
at this track club. Oh.

06:47.641 --> 06:48.776
What do you think about Georgia?

06:48.876 --> 06:50.277
She's fast.

06:50.377 --> 06:51.344
Who's this?

06:51.445 --> 06:52.713
Uh, their top sprinter.

06:52.813 --> 06:53.981
Yeah, she ran
an 11.5 hundred

06:54.081 --> 06:56.416
at her last meet.
Just into the wind.

06:56.517 --> 06:57.685
It was...
You know...

07:04.925 --> 07:06.093
Oh, my God...

07:06.193 --> 07:07.427
Excuse me, sir.
Please stand back.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.942
Any idea who this is?

07:23.410 --> 07:26.747
It's my cousin. Cody.

07:26.847 --> 07:28.048
Tiffany?

07:28.148 --> 07:29.282
It's all right,
Aunt Lillie.

07:29.382 --> 07:30.518
Who was
that screaming?

07:30.618 --> 07:32.920
Just some girl.

07:33.020 --> 07:34.655
Radio Crime Scene
that we have a homicide.

07:34.755 --> 07:36.323
Seal off the apartment.

07:36.423 --> 07:37.457
Okay.

08:00.814 --> 08:02.249
Yeah?

08:02.349 --> 08:03.617
Ma?

08:03.717 --> 08:05.185
They don't make it easy
to get in here.

08:06.554 --> 08:07.555
...let me you know were coming?

08:07.655 --> 08:09.590
I decided last-minute

08:09.690 --> 08:10.724
that what I got to say

08:10.824 --> 08:12.593
is better to say it in person.

08:12.693 --> 08:15.162
Ma, what is it?

08:15.262 --> 08:19.166
Your brother's church
is being sold.

08:20.968 --> 08:21.969
Uh...

08:22.069 --> 08:23.837
Sold? To-to who?

08:23.937 --> 08:27.007
To... I don't know, somebody
who wants the property.

08:27.107 --> 08:28.208
I don't know who.

08:28.308 --> 08:29.743
Yeah, well,
there's a lot of that

08:29.843 --> 08:31.178
happening in East New York, Ma.

08:31.278 --> 08:32.445
That's all you got to say?

08:32.546 --> 08:33.681
"There's a lot
of that happening"?

08:33.781 --> 08:34.982
It's the Brooklyn Diocese,

08:35.082 --> 08:36.149
sometimes they decide
to consolidate...

08:40.520 --> 08:42.122
That church is his whole life.

08:42.222 --> 08:46.459
Uh, I don't think that there's
a lot that I could do, Ma.

08:46.560 --> 08:47.895
You can call your brother

08:47.995 --> 08:49.229
and ask him
how he is.

08:49.329 --> 08:50.864
Not for nothing,
but he could call me also.

08:50.964 --> 08:53.200
Okay, you don't call him
and he doesn't call you?

08:53.300 --> 08:55.569
So you're
strangers now?

08:55.669 --> 08:57.004
All right, I will call him.

08:57.104 --> 08:58.171
Good.

09:00.107 --> 09:03.243
Forget about it.
Forget call. Go see him.

09:03.343 --> 09:05.613
All right. I'll go see him.

09:05.713 --> 09:07.915
Okay. Well...

09:08.015 --> 09:10.050
Love you, too.

09:11.484 --> 09:13.053
How do I get out of here?

09:13.153 --> 09:14.054
Okay, come on.

09:14.154 --> 09:15.623
Apparently,

09:15.723 --> 09:16.957
neither Quinlan nor Bentley

09:17.057 --> 09:18.992
had any
interactions with Cody.

09:19.092 --> 09:21.929
He lived in a different
building from them.

09:22.029 --> 09:23.296
And he has half a dozen collars.

09:23.396 --> 09:25.565
Possession, disorderly conduct,

09:25.666 --> 09:27.000
plus eight
outstanding warrants.

09:27.100 --> 09:29.136
I think we should talk
to the grandmother again.

09:29.236 --> 09:30.604
Her niece said she had
to give her a sedative.

09:30.704 --> 09:33.040
Head over there.
Maybe it's worn off.

09:36.576 --> 09:39.713
Oh. Well, lookee here.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.581
Old Carl Lewis

09:41.682 --> 09:43.283
done pulled a hammy.
No, I did not.

09:43.383 --> 09:44.918
Just preventative
measures, my man.

09:45.018 --> 09:46.854
Who you trying
to impress, Andre?

09:48.055 --> 09:49.089
Nobody.

09:49.189 --> 09:50.724
So you out there
running sprints

09:50.824 --> 09:52.960
with our CO just for fun?

09:53.060 --> 09:54.327
I'm out there because
she asked me to be out there,

09:54.427 --> 09:55.929
And you know what?
Hmm?

09:56.029 --> 09:57.865
I'm still capable of respectable
times in the hundred.

09:57.965 --> 09:59.599
You're out there
trying to show her

09:59.700 --> 10:01.301
that your head is on straight.

10:01.401 --> 10:03.704
Now, uh,
would you kindly

10:03.804 --> 10:06.239
move your capable feet
so I can get to my locker?

10:06.339 --> 10:07.574
Please.
Thank you.

10:07.675 --> 10:09.409
So kind of you.

10:14.147 --> 10:16.950
Did your grandson
have an argument with anyone?

10:18.752 --> 10:20.688
Not that I know of.

10:20.788 --> 10:22.723
The music was
so loud,

10:22.823 --> 10:24.858
and she was in her room
with the door closed.

10:24.958 --> 10:27.060
She wouldn't have heard it
if he was.

10:27.160 --> 10:28.896
I think I would've
heard it.

10:28.996 --> 10:30.964
Okay,
Aunt Lillie.

10:31.064 --> 10:33.066
What time did you
get here, Ms. Edwards?

10:33.166 --> 10:35.402
After
the cops arrived.

10:35.502 --> 10:37.404
The sirens woke me up.

10:37.504 --> 10:40.941
I saw the police cars lined
up and down the street, so...

10:41.041 --> 10:43.410
I decided to see
what was going on.

10:43.510 --> 10:46.046
You didn't want to come over
to hang out beforehand?

10:47.014 --> 10:50.017
Cody asked me all the time,

10:50.117 --> 10:52.820
"Come on, cuz.
Come chill with us."

10:52.920 --> 10:54.554
I was dead
on my feet last night.

10:54.654 --> 10:55.689
I wasn't going nowhere.

10:55.789 --> 10:57.657
I had two

10:57.758 --> 11:00.227
doctor's appointments yesterday.

11:00.327 --> 11:01.594
You did.

11:01.695 --> 11:03.563
She takes me.

11:03.663 --> 11:04.965
She waits for me.

11:05.065 --> 11:06.466
All right,
Aunt Lillie.

11:06.566 --> 11:10.170
They're not interested in
who takes you to the doctor.

11:10.270 --> 11:11.671
Would you happen
to know the names

11:11.772 --> 11:13.807
of some of the people
who were here?

11:13.907 --> 11:16.309
I know Renaldo was here.

11:16.409 --> 11:18.578
Would you happen to
know his last name?

11:18.678 --> 11:21.782
Briggs. Renaldo Briggs.

11:21.882 --> 11:25.318
All right, is there,
um, anyone else?

11:25.418 --> 11:29.189
Probably that boy
Draymon was there.

11:29.289 --> 11:32.425
What's his last name?

11:32.525 --> 11:34.427
I wouldn't know that.

11:34.527 --> 11:36.229
Straw.

11:46.473 --> 11:49.242
Let's get you something
to eat, Aunt Lillie.

11:49.342 --> 11:51.211
You haven't had
anything yet today.

11:52.880 --> 11:55.048
I don't want nothing.

11:56.016 --> 11:57.918
She just needs to eat.

11:59.286 --> 12:00.854
Okay.

12:00.954 --> 12:02.455
Thank you for your time.

12:08.361 --> 12:10.163
Okay, okay.

12:10.263 --> 12:11.765
Okay.

12:13.633 --> 12:16.069
You know what?
Huh?

12:16.169 --> 12:17.938
I'll never get used
to these kind of shoes.

12:18.038 --> 12:19.572
Why not?
They look good on you.

12:19.672 --> 12:20.740
But they don't
take a shine.

12:20.841 --> 12:21.708
You gonna be wearing
hard-soled shoes

12:21.809 --> 12:23.243
walking a foot post?

12:23.343 --> 12:24.978
I'm not saying that
they're not more comfortable.

12:25.078 --> 12:27.047
What I'm saying
is when you look good,

12:27.147 --> 12:28.481
you do better at your job.

12:29.582 --> 12:30.683
Guys.
Hey.

12:30.784 --> 12:32.719
Hey, Brandy.

12:32.820 --> 12:34.521
How you doing?
Good.

12:40.627 --> 12:41.895
Are you sore
from working out

12:41.995 --> 12:43.931
with the girls'
track club yesterday?

12:44.631 --> 12:46.666
Okay, everybody got jokes today.

12:46.766 --> 12:48.768
I'll see you out front.
All right.

12:49.569 --> 12:50.537
I'm feeling all right.

12:50.637 --> 12:51.805
Good.

12:51.905 --> 12:53.340
You know, this is

12:53.440 --> 12:54.875
the track club that Haywood's
helping out with, right?

12:54.975 --> 12:56.376
Yeah. Yeah, I know.

12:56.476 --> 12:58.879
I know that you're
helping her help out.

12:58.979 --> 13:00.513
Brandy?

13:00.613 --> 13:01.581
Andre?

13:01.681 --> 13:03.016
I ran some sprints.

13:03.116 --> 13:04.818
It actually feels really good.

13:05.819 --> 13:07.420
Great.

13:14.161 --> 13:16.629
Mom told me
they're selling the church.

13:16.729 --> 13:17.797
Looks like it.

13:17.898 --> 13:19.199
They say why?

13:19.299 --> 13:20.500
The land the church
is sitting on

13:20.600 --> 13:22.302
is a lot more valuable
to developers

13:22.402 --> 13:24.771
than it's worth as a place
where a few aging Filipinos

13:24.872 --> 13:27.240
and Puerto Ricans
come for Mass.

13:28.475 --> 13:29.576
So, it's a done deal?

13:29.676 --> 13:30.810
Afraid so.

13:30.911 --> 13:32.345
Bishop called me himself.

13:32.445 --> 13:35.382
Wow. Well,
I'm sorry, Frank.

13:36.416 --> 13:38.785
Matthew tells us Jesus
entered the temple

13:38.886 --> 13:40.687
and drove out all
who sold and bought

13:40.787 --> 13:42.389
in the temple.

13:42.489 --> 13:43.456
He said "My house

13:43.556 --> 13:44.858
"shall be called
a house of prayer,

13:44.958 --> 13:47.760
but you have made it
a den of thieves."

13:47.861 --> 13:51.098
Why would I imagine
it could be otherwise?

14:02.876 --> 14:05.545
<i>Renaldo, what can you
tell us about Cody's death?</i>

14:05.645 --> 14:07.280
Man, I'm sick
about it.

14:07.380 --> 14:09.649
You see him having an
argument with anyone?

14:09.749 --> 14:13.020
That was the thing about Cody.
He was fickle as hell.

14:13.120 --> 14:14.654
What do you
mean by that?

14:14.754 --> 14:17.724
What do you
mean by that?
If you were his friend,

14:17.824 --> 14:19.526
you were his friend.

14:19.626 --> 14:21.028
<i>You start cracking
the wrong jokes about Cody,</i>

14:21.128 --> 14:22.162
all of a sudden
he'd be like,

14:22.262 --> 14:23.430
"That's my liquor
you're drinking,

14:23.530 --> 14:25.999
my weed you're smoking.
Give me $20."

14:26.099 --> 14:27.734
<i>You say you ain't got it,</i>

14:27.834 --> 14:29.002
he get ugly.

14:29.102 --> 14:30.337
And he get ugly
last night?

14:30.437 --> 14:31.972
Last night,
he was chilled out.

14:32.072 --> 14:33.606
He had his girl.

14:34.674 --> 14:35.909
He was hanging.

14:36.009 --> 14:37.210
Draymon, you know
his girl's name?

14:37.310 --> 14:38.478
Yeah.

14:38.578 --> 14:39.947
Savannah Obie.

14:40.047 --> 14:41.714
Savannah Obie.

14:41.814 --> 14:43.416
Savannah Obie.

14:43.516 --> 14:45.652
It's the police.
We'd like to talk to you.

14:48.588 --> 14:50.457
Savannah Obie?

14:56.196 --> 14:58.331
Savannah Obie?

14:59.666 --> 15:01.101
Police. Stop.

15:06.974 --> 15:08.341
Yo, bros, police after me.

15:08.441 --> 15:10.577
Please, I need your bike,
I need your bike.

15:12.679 --> 15:14.214
Hey, chill!

15:22.255 --> 15:25.325
You're gonna have to wait
on the bike ride, Savannah.

15:25.425 --> 15:26.459
Now stand up.

15:27.327 --> 15:28.161
All right.

15:28.261 --> 15:30.097
Come on, let's go.

15:36.569 --> 15:38.071
What was the relationship
between you and Cody?

15:38.171 --> 15:39.339
He did his thing and I did mine.

15:39.439 --> 15:40.640
If we were both
in the same place

15:40.740 --> 15:42.109
at the same time,
we'd hook up,

15:42.209 --> 15:44.711
but I don't know
who else he was into,

15:44.811 --> 15:46.546
and I don't know
what he was into.

15:46.646 --> 15:47.780
Yeah, but you were
with him last night.

15:47.880 --> 15:49.349
Until I left.

15:50.750 --> 15:52.219
Then why'd you leave?

15:52.319 --> 15:54.021
'Cause I was meeting
somebody else, okay?

15:54.121 --> 15:55.322
Who?

15:55.422 --> 15:57.157
I ain't gonna say his name.

15:57.257 --> 15:58.491
This isn't a social visit, Savannah.

15:58.591 --> 16:00.593
It's a homicide investigation.

16:00.693 --> 16:03.663
That means you're gonna give us
names, times and places,

16:03.763 --> 16:05.465
and we're gonna have
to verify them.

16:05.565 --> 16:07.334
Unless I say I want to talk
to Johnnie Cochran, right?

16:07.434 --> 16:08.635
Johnnie Cochran's dead.

16:08.735 --> 16:11.704
Well, somebody
like Johnnie Cochran.

16:11.804 --> 16:13.473
So you're not
interested in

16:13.573 --> 16:15.975
helping us find
who killed your friend,

16:16.076 --> 16:17.377
is that right?

16:17.477 --> 16:19.012
It wasn't me,
I could tell you that much.

16:19.112 --> 16:20.547
Well, no one's
accusing you.

16:24.284 --> 16:26.419
I'd be looking at
that fool Draymon.

16:26.519 --> 16:28.355
Yeah? Why's that?

16:28.455 --> 16:32.025
He was seeing
Cody's cousin, Tiffany,

16:32.125 --> 16:33.660
who Cody couldn't stand.

16:33.760 --> 16:35.862
Cody could
have got up

16:35.962 --> 16:37.264
in Draymon's business,

16:37.364 --> 16:39.599
Draymon could have snapped.

16:39.699 --> 16:41.834
That's who I'd be looking at.

16:43.036 --> 16:44.771
You're welcome.

16:51.911 --> 16:53.446
Ah.

16:56.083 --> 16:58.751
Chief. Sorry I'm late.

17:00.520 --> 17:02.455
You know, they told me
a representative of the LLC

17:02.555 --> 17:04.457
buying the church would
be meeting with me.

17:04.557 --> 17:06.693
I had no idea it would be you.

17:06.793 --> 17:08.561
Well, it's always
best not to

17:08.661 --> 17:10.197
trumpet your
personal identity

17:10.297 --> 17:12.332
in real estate
transactions, Chief.

17:12.432 --> 17:13.866
It just gives the rabble
an opportunity

17:13.966 --> 17:15.268
to score some points,

17:15.368 --> 17:17.637
not to mention
to threaten my personal safety.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.974
I don't know how you managed to
stay out of prison, Mr. Lustig.

17:22.075 --> 17:24.177
That shouldn't
be a surprise to you.

17:24.277 --> 17:26.579
I mean, all that drama
stemmed from

17:26.679 --> 17:28.848
that crazy real estate broker
Brenda Sykes.

17:28.948 --> 17:30.350
What, you think
I'm clumsy enough

17:30.450 --> 17:32.519
to have some Slavic
steroid monster

17:32.619 --> 17:34.654
shoot up a van
in broad daylight?

17:34.754 --> 17:35.955
Or lucky enough to have someone

17:36.055 --> 17:38.225
like Regina Haywood
save your life.

17:38.325 --> 17:39.859
Yeah.

17:39.959 --> 17:42.362
I am forever grateful
to her for that.

17:43.496 --> 17:46.499
So, not only
aren't you in prison,

17:46.599 --> 17:49.202
you're the principal
partner in this LLC.

17:49.302 --> 17:50.837
It is an incredibly
exciting time

17:50.937 --> 17:53.440
to be a real estate
developer in New York.

17:53.540 --> 17:55.007
You're looking to
acquire the land

17:55.108 --> 17:56.343
under St. Abigail's?

17:56.443 --> 17:59.279
St. Abigail's.

17:59.379 --> 18:01.013
Oh, you don't know.

18:02.349 --> 18:03.983
Across from the park
on Knickerbocker.

18:04.083 --> 18:06.819
Oh, right, yes. Absolutely.

18:06.919 --> 18:08.721
60 units, state-of-the-art
environmentally,

18:08.821 --> 18:09.756
which means

18:09.856 --> 18:12.058
green roof, in-unit composting,

18:12.159 --> 18:13.326
geothermal heating and cooling.

18:13.426 --> 18:14.827
Hmm. You set on that location?

18:14.927 --> 18:17.297
Well, it all starts
with the location, Chief.

18:17.397 --> 18:18.731
It's the first rule
of real estate.

18:18.831 --> 18:21.334
I'm just wondering
if there might be, uh,

18:21.434 --> 18:23.670
some other alternatives
around there.

18:23.770 --> 18:27.174
Okay,
what, are you... looking for

18:27.274 --> 18:29.142
a finder's fee
from someone?

18:29.242 --> 18:32.078
The church means a lot
to the people in the parish.

18:32.179 --> 18:34.647
Well, there are plenty
of churches in Brooklyn.

18:35.482 --> 18:36.683
People get attached to the ones

18:36.783 --> 18:39.552
they've spent
their lives going to.

18:40.753 --> 18:43.656
You get attached,
you get unattached.

18:43.756 --> 18:45.825
It's the life
of the city, Chief.

18:47.827 --> 18:50.062
I'm in the mood for a burger.
They got good burgers?

18:50.163 --> 18:51.598
It says "Goody's Hotspot."

18:51.698 --> 18:54.634
I could make this into
a fortune, let me tell you.

18:56.736 --> 18:58.037
All right, I'll see you later.

18:58.137 --> 18:59.706
All right,
I'll see you there.

19:02.442 --> 19:04.311
Oh, hey, Andre.
How you doing, Coach?

19:04.411 --> 19:06.646
Good. Oh, can
I just let you know

19:06.746 --> 19:08.315
that the girls
really appreciate

19:08.415 --> 19:09.582
you coming
to practice?

19:09.682 --> 19:12.084
Oh. Well,
I appreciate them. Mmm.

19:12.185 --> 19:14.053
For one thing,
you're closer to them in age

19:14.153 --> 19:15.255
than me or Regina.

19:15.355 --> 19:16.556
I never thought
about that

19:16.656 --> 19:17.690
but, yeah, I guess you're right.

19:17.790 --> 19:18.891
Hey.
Hey.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.960
You heading home?

19:21.060 --> 19:22.829
Yeah, I'm just gonna swing
by the track on the way.

19:22.929 --> 19:24.331
Okay.

19:24.431 --> 19:26.666
I'll see you soon.
All right.

19:27.934 --> 19:29.469
I meant to
tell you, too,

19:29.569 --> 19:30.570
that you're not a bad
runner yourself.

19:30.670 --> 19:32.104
Thank you.
Yeah, I mean,

19:32.205 --> 19:33.573
you've got
good form.

19:33.673 --> 19:35.141
You could work on that
breath control, though.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.210
Well, I'll work on my breath
control for next practice, then.

19:37.310 --> 19:38.578
All right.
All right.

19:38.678 --> 19:40.480
See you later.
I'll see you.

19:46.686 --> 19:48.688
So, I'm gonna go handle
some business, all right?

19:48.788 --> 19:50.089
But you roll in
and you do your thing.

19:50.189 --> 19:51.458
I'm gonna do my thing,
but you just got to

19:51.558 --> 19:53.025
remember to come
pick me up.

19:53.125 --> 19:54.427
On time.
That was one...

19:57.930 --> 19:59.632
Hey, Coach.

19:59.732 --> 20:01.000
Fool, just answer the question.

20:01.100 --> 20:03.603
Nobody else seems to have
a problem with it.

20:03.703 --> 20:04.804
If you're not already
on the track,

20:04.904 --> 20:07.907
you two are
running late.

20:09.108 --> 20:11.544
Y'all moving like
you want extra laps.

20:11.644 --> 20:12.679
My bad, mama.

20:12.779 --> 20:14.447
Watch your mouth, Georgia.

20:14.547 --> 20:15.682
Sorry, Coach.

20:15.782 --> 20:18.084
Go inside and get warmed up.

20:22.289 --> 20:23.556
Hey, who is that guy?

20:23.656 --> 20:25.057
I don't know.

20:36.035 --> 20:37.970
Okay, I'll go this way. Hey.

20:38.070 --> 20:40.740
What, you guys get a call
about something else here?

20:40.840 --> 20:43.510
Yeah, we're looking for
this guy, Draymon Straw.

20:43.610 --> 20:46.012
If it's who I think
it is, he's in 1-W.

20:46.112 --> 20:48.615
You doing your own
recon now, Brandy?

20:48.715 --> 20:50.883
Wouldn't you,
if you lived here?

20:50.983 --> 20:52.952
I wouldn't live here,
for starters.

20:53.920 --> 20:55.087
Let me just
take you to him.

21:04.664 --> 21:06.198
Oh, laundry day.

21:06.299 --> 21:07.467
Oh.

21:07.567 --> 21:08.535
Why?

21:08.635 --> 21:10.036
You got more questions for me?

21:10.136 --> 21:11.504
Just making sure we
didn't miss anything.

21:11.604 --> 21:13.540
Somebody told us
you've been, uh,

21:13.640 --> 21:15.575
going out with
Cody's cousin, Tiffany.

21:15.675 --> 21:17.377
What's that got to
do with anything?

21:17.477 --> 21:18.445
Mmm, a lot.

21:18.545 --> 21:19.846
Like not upsetting Cody

21:19.946 --> 21:20.847
that you were
kicking it with Tiffany.

21:20.947 --> 21:23.350
Cody's my boy.

21:23.450 --> 21:24.584
He's the one who introduced us.

21:24.684 --> 21:26.419
You said you left
at what time?

21:26.519 --> 21:27.954
Around, like, 11:30?

21:28.054 --> 21:29.121
And by that point,

21:29.221 --> 21:30.757
had Cody gotten into
a beef with anyone?

21:30.857 --> 21:33.493
I'm not obligated
to answer anything

21:33.593 --> 21:34.627
'cause I did nothing.

21:34.727 --> 21:36.563
Excuse me.

21:39.632 --> 21:42.201
Looks like we're gonna have
to knock on every door in here.

21:42.301 --> 21:43.970
It's gonna be a real drag
when people start asking

21:44.070 --> 21:46.606
why two detectives are
hanging around Ruskin Gardens.

21:46.706 --> 21:48.107
Folks start talking,

21:48.207 --> 21:49.175
one person tells the next

21:49.275 --> 21:50.176
how we got to them.

21:50.276 --> 21:51.277
Not only that,

21:51.378 --> 21:52.579
they play
detective themselves.

21:52.679 --> 21:53.713
Ah.
They start
tracking who said what

21:53.813 --> 21:54.914
that leads all the way...

21:55.014 --> 21:57.617
Back to 1-W.

21:57.717 --> 21:59.185
It's...

22:02.989 --> 22:04.824
Words get really twisted
when you're not the one

22:04.924 --> 22:05.892
telling the whole story, Draymon.

22:05.992 --> 22:07.960
All right, all right.

22:08.060 --> 22:09.362
I don't want nobody
to know this was me

22:09.462 --> 22:10.830
who told you this.

22:10.930 --> 22:12.231
All right, we'll try to
keep your name out of it.

22:12.331 --> 22:14.867
There's a guy named Lorenzo
who lives in 1-P.

22:14.967 --> 22:16.102
Big dude.

22:16.202 --> 22:17.570
He was pissed off
the noise woke him up,

22:17.670 --> 22:19.305
told Cody if he didn't
shut it down,

22:19.406 --> 22:21.908
Lorenzo'd come back
and shut it down himself.

22:22.008 --> 22:23.075
Okay.

22:24.076 --> 22:25.177
Thanks.

22:26.112 --> 22:27.380
Took notes?
Yeah.

22:27.480 --> 22:28.448
Where's 1-P?

22:28.548 --> 22:30.683
Why you got so many earrings?

22:30.783 --> 22:32.452
Why she always got so
many questions, Georgia?

22:33.553 --> 22:35.622
Okay, break's over.

22:35.722 --> 22:36.656
Hey, Coach. Yo.

22:36.756 --> 22:38.257
That mean you finally gonna

22:38.357 --> 22:39.659
run with us today?

22:39.759 --> 22:40.893
Only if you could keep up.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.862
Yeah, we'll see
about that.

22:42.962 --> 22:46.032
Oh, all right,
we'll see about that. Yeah.

22:46.132 --> 22:47.634
For real, though,
who is this guy

22:47.734 --> 22:48.835
over here?

22:48.935 --> 22:50.503
You plan on finding out?

22:50.603 --> 22:52.338
I'm gonna
be over here.

22:53.806 --> 22:56.075
Hi. Can I help you?

22:56.175 --> 22:59.646
Just gonna watch my friends
Georgia and Tanya work it out.

22:59.746 --> 23:01.380
This is
a closed practice.

23:01.481 --> 23:02.715
Since when?

23:02.815 --> 23:04.350
I want to keep
the athletes

23:04.451 --> 23:06.218
focused and not distracted.

23:06.318 --> 23:09.355
Nobody else seems to have
a problem with it.

23:09.456 --> 23:11.257
I didn't catch your name.

23:11.357 --> 23:13.325
'Cause I didn't throw it.

23:34.714 --> 23:36.716
Connect Four?
Mm-hmm.

23:36.816 --> 23:37.817
Yeah.

23:37.917 --> 23:40.587
How about some Spades
or some bones?

23:40.687 --> 23:41.988
I don't know how to play
either of those.

23:42.088 --> 23:43.355
Then let me teach you.

23:43.456 --> 23:44.824
See, the worst thing
you could have at the table

23:44.924 --> 23:46.425
is a partner who don't know
what the hell they doing.

23:46.526 --> 23:48.094
Hey, Lorenzo.
How you doing,
Sandeford?

23:48.194 --> 23:49.762
All good. Lorenzo.

23:49.862 --> 23:52.331
We heard that you
paid Cody Toliver

23:52.431 --> 23:53.900
a visit the
other night.

23:54.000 --> 23:55.367
Who are you?

23:55.468 --> 23:58.104
This is Officer Brandy
Quinlan, also from 7-4.

23:58.204 --> 23:59.706
Look, I'm a working man.

23:59.806 --> 24:02.942
Most days, my feet hit the floor
at 5:00 in the morning.

24:03.042 --> 24:04.744
I asked him to keep
the noise down

24:04.844 --> 24:06.045
out of consideration.

24:06.145 --> 24:07.947
Yeah, that's-that's
not too much to ask.

24:08.047 --> 24:09.549
A detective put
a business card under my door,

24:09.649 --> 24:11.083
said they wanted to talk to me.

24:11.183 --> 24:13.553
Well, I live in Ruskin Gardens,

24:13.653 --> 24:14.987
and I don't have
a business card.

24:15.087 --> 24:16.255
I just figured

24:16.355 --> 24:17.657
I'd walk up and
try and catch you.

24:17.757 --> 24:20.059
I didn't kill Cody.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

24:20.159 --> 24:21.460
Nobody said you killed nobody,

24:21.561 --> 24:23.930
and I ain't asking you
to snitch on nobody.

24:24.030 --> 24:26.866
But Cody got murdered,
and that ain't going away.

24:26.966 --> 24:28.034
You her boss?

24:28.134 --> 24:29.969
No,

24:30.069 --> 24:32.605
but she's somebody you might
want to take seriously.

24:34.240 --> 24:36.943
A half a dozen people saw me
go back into my apartment.

24:37.043 --> 24:40.046
And if that's not enough,
I was on the phone

24:40.146 --> 24:41.413
with my ex-wife
and I bought a pair

24:41.514 --> 24:43.583
of bedroom slippers
for my mother on Amazon.

24:43.683 --> 24:45.918
Okay.

24:46.018 --> 24:48.454
Any idea who did kill him?

24:48.555 --> 24:50.122
Tiffany did
the heavy lifting,

24:50.222 --> 24:51.591
Cody burned through
Grandma's money.

24:51.691 --> 24:53.492
By rights, should've been her.

24:53.593 --> 24:55.595
That was her grandson, though.

24:56.729 --> 24:59.365
You never wanted to kill
anyone in your family?

25:02.268 --> 25:03.836
Have a nice night.

25:12.311 --> 25:13.479
Did you run
that license plate?

25:13.580 --> 25:16.182
Car was registered
to a Dexter Harper,

25:16.282 --> 25:18.150
who was recently collared
for credit card,

25:18.250 --> 25:19.485
Paycheck Protection
Program fraud,

25:19.586 --> 25:21.721
among other things.

25:21.821 --> 25:23.790
But who you probably saw
was Terrence Harper,

25:23.890 --> 25:24.891
that's Dexter's son.

25:24.991 --> 25:27.426
Dexter ain't getting
out for a while.

25:27.526 --> 25:29.195
Terrence was arrested
for car theft

25:29.295 --> 25:30.196
last year.

25:30.296 --> 25:31.731
Thanks, Stan.

25:31.831 --> 25:33.432
Is this something you want me
keep an eye out for?

25:33.532 --> 25:35.602
No, I can handle it. Thank you.

25:36.502 --> 25:37.937
All right.

25:42.108 --> 25:43.710
Rough night of bouncing?

25:45.645 --> 25:46.545
One of the members of some

25:46.646 --> 25:48.648
Korean boy
band came in

25:48.748 --> 25:50.449
to the bar
with his whole entourage.

25:50.549 --> 25:52.719
I had to make sure
nobody approached him.

25:52.819 --> 25:55.454
Didn't get out of
there till 2:00 a.m.

25:55.554 --> 25:57.356
You can't keep this
going indefinitely.

25:57.456 --> 25:58.691
You know that, right?

25:58.791 --> 26:00.492
Yeah, well, Corinne
was counting on me

26:00.593 --> 26:01.794
to come up
with the money

26:01.894 --> 26:03.395
to keep the lights
on in that joint.

26:03.495 --> 26:04.864
She still has to be
able to count on me.

26:04.964 --> 26:06.966
'Cause that way she'll see
what a big mistake she made

26:07.066 --> 26:08.367
dumping you. Yeah.

26:08.467 --> 26:09.636
Something like that.

26:09.736 --> 26:11.403
What, you gonna tell me
I'm stupid

26:11.503 --> 26:12.538
for wanting that?
No, you're stupid

26:12.639 --> 26:13.940
for a lot of reasons,

26:14.040 --> 26:15.842
and that's why I love you. Yeah.

26:15.942 --> 26:17.343
Can we get to work now?

26:17.443 --> 26:19.211
Yes, please.

26:19.311 --> 26:21.513
As always, we start
with the finances.

26:23.082 --> 26:24.717
These are the grandmother's
credit card statements...

26:24.817 --> 26:27.419
Wow, $600 sneakers.

26:28.387 --> 26:29.989
Hmm, dinners at Mr. Chow's.

26:30.089 --> 26:31.791
Wow, somebody's living
their best life.

26:31.891 --> 26:34.894
Grandma Toliver didn't strike me
as a sneaker head, either.

26:36.195 --> 26:38.064
Safe to say...

26:38.164 --> 26:40.199
...it's not Lillie Toliver.

26:40.299 --> 26:41.433
So, I guess the trade-off was

26:41.533 --> 26:43.369
Cody taking care
of his grandmother.

26:44.470 --> 26:46.172
I'm sorry for interrupting.

26:46.272 --> 26:48.875
Um... could I possibly give you
my take on this?

26:48.975 --> 26:50.576
Go ahead.

26:50.677 --> 26:53.045
So, Cody wasn't
taking care of her.

26:53.145 --> 26:55.414
Her niece
Tiffany was.

26:55.514 --> 26:57.383
And according
to this guy Lorenzo,

26:57.483 --> 26:58.851
Tiffany does everything.

26:58.951 --> 27:01.387
Oh, so you're conducting
interviews now?

27:01.487 --> 27:04.190
Well, I've gotten to know people
that live in Ruskin Gardens,

27:04.290 --> 27:05.825
which, I thought that was
the whole idea behind

27:05.925 --> 27:07.359
having members of
the service move in there.

27:07.459 --> 27:09.461
I mean, since
I see them every day

27:09.561 --> 27:12.364
in the elevators, lobby,
laundry room,

27:12.464 --> 27:14.533
my face has become
familiar enough to them,

27:14.633 --> 27:15.601
that they open up to me.

27:15.702 --> 27:17.436
Did Lorenzo share any insight

27:17.536 --> 27:19.205
into who might've done
the murder, then?

27:20.172 --> 27:22.074
He didn't want
to point any fingers.

27:22.174 --> 27:23.375
But...

27:23.475 --> 27:25.511
I have seen Tiffany

27:25.611 --> 27:27.346
get her aunt from a wheelchair

27:27.446 --> 27:29.515
into a taxi cab to go to church,

27:29.615 --> 27:31.483
and I remember thinking that...

27:31.583 --> 27:33.519
this was her whole life.

27:35.087 --> 27:37.957
I think we ought
to talk to Tiffany.

27:45.331 --> 27:47.466
Pastrami on rye

27:47.566 --> 27:48.968
from Gottlieb's.

27:49.068 --> 27:50.102
You interested?

27:50.202 --> 27:52.038
You could twist my arm.

27:56.042 --> 27:58.144
Gottlieb's, huh?

27:58.945 --> 28:02.148
I did not expect that you
would know about Gottlieb's.

28:02.248 --> 28:03.682
Well, being constantly

28:03.783 --> 28:05.752
on the move
with politicians

28:05.852 --> 28:08.387
works up quite an appetite. Mm.

28:08.487 --> 28:10.990
Something I should,
uh, remember, huh?

28:11.958 --> 28:14.060
Have a seat.

28:14.160 --> 28:15.361
Okay.

28:15.461 --> 28:17.764
So, uh,

28:17.864 --> 28:20.099
you met with Adam Lustig.

28:20.199 --> 28:21.467
I did.

28:21.567 --> 28:22.969
Adam needs

28:23.069 --> 28:25.471
frequent reassurance
that he is as important

28:25.571 --> 28:27.573
as he thinks he is,

28:27.673 --> 28:29.608
but he does
come through

28:29.708 --> 28:32.644
with campaign contributions
when we need him to.

28:32.745 --> 28:34.580
So, apparently
he told you that I, uh,

28:34.680 --> 28:35.882
reached out to him.
Did he tell you why?

28:35.982 --> 28:38.684
Well, whether or not he did...

28:39.518 --> 28:41.453
...you could assume that

28:41.553 --> 28:43.455
I would find out.

28:44.690 --> 28:47.794
I took a shot
that he might be open

28:47.894 --> 28:48.761
to leaving

28:48.861 --> 28:50.930
my brother's church intact.

28:51.030 --> 28:52.331
Well, intact or not,

28:52.431 --> 28:54.566
your brother's problem is with

28:54.666 --> 28:56.335
the Brooklyn Diocese,

28:56.435 --> 28:58.204
not Lustig.

28:58.304 --> 29:00.072
And my brother's problem becomes

29:00.172 --> 29:02.741
my problem,
something I can't ignore.

29:03.910 --> 29:07.479
Do you know Bishop McAllister?

29:08.580 --> 29:10.716
Um... I think we marched

29:10.817 --> 29:13.319
in the St. Paddy's
Day Parade together,

29:13.419 --> 29:14.753
been to a couple
of cop funerals.

29:14.854 --> 29:15.988
I don't really know him, but...

29:16.088 --> 29:19.058
You know that he is
on the shortlist

29:19.158 --> 29:20.359
to make cardinal?

29:20.459 --> 29:23.029
Okay, I did not know that.

29:24.630 --> 29:27.599
If this world
is going to make

29:27.699 --> 29:30.336
any kind of sense
to you at all,

29:30.436 --> 29:32.805
that is something
you should know.

29:36.408 --> 29:38.077
Bon appétit.

29:42.982 --> 29:44.250
Hey, Georgia.

29:44.350 --> 29:46.218
Can I talk
to you a minute?
What's up, Regina?

29:46.318 --> 29:47.854
Hey-yo.
You don't want
to talk to me?

29:47.954 --> 29:49.021
No, I don't want
to talk to you,

29:49.121 --> 29:50.489
I want you to do
your drills, girl.

29:50.589 --> 29:52.024
Oh, a'ight.

29:52.124 --> 29:53.392
A'ight.

29:53.492 --> 29:54.560
She crazy, isn't she?

29:56.863 --> 29:59.832
Hey, how much do you know
about Terrence Harper?

29:59.932 --> 30:02.701
I know he's Tanya's boyfriend.

30:02.801 --> 30:04.803
Is there something
I should know?

30:04.904 --> 30:06.705
Would it surprise
you to know

30:06.805 --> 30:08.274
that he's got
a criminal record?

30:08.374 --> 30:09.708
Not really.

30:09.808 --> 30:11.810
We've known lots of guys
with a criminal record.

30:11.911 --> 30:13.079
Yeah.

30:13.179 --> 30:15.414
His father, he's serving
a 15-year sentence

30:15.514 --> 30:18.117
in a federal prison,
so there's that.

30:18.217 --> 30:19.751
How is it you
know all this?

30:19.852 --> 30:22.488
Oh, I'm a cop.
It's my business to know.

30:22.588 --> 30:23.990
Okay.

30:24.090 --> 30:25.791
Why you telling
me this?

30:28.227 --> 30:32.932
You could run track
for a Division One school.

30:34.000 --> 30:35.534
Get a first-rate
college education

30:35.634 --> 30:37.636
on a full ride.

30:37.736 --> 30:40.839
And you continue
to be disciplined,

30:40.940 --> 30:43.943
you stay focused,
you stay healthy.

30:45.111 --> 30:46.078
Georgia,

30:46.178 --> 30:48.714
you don't want
to look back five

30:48.814 --> 30:51.083
or ten years
or 15 years from now

30:51.183 --> 30:53.920
with nothing but regret
about what you didn't do.

30:54.020 --> 30:55.321
I've had a
lot of people

30:55.421 --> 30:56.655
tell me this before,

30:56.755 --> 30:58.590
mostly people
who don't know me.

30:58.690 --> 31:00.259
They think they do,
but they don't.

31:00.359 --> 31:02.594
And what about the people
who do know you?
Like Tanya?

31:02.694 --> 31:04.763
She know me.

31:05.831 --> 31:07.033
I'm not talking about Tanya.

31:07.133 --> 31:08.500
No, I know
you're not.

31:08.600 --> 31:10.369
She don't
count, do she?

31:12.338 --> 31:13.739
I didn't say that.

31:13.839 --> 31:15.874
Look, I don't
need nobody

31:15.975 --> 31:17.977
to tell me how to
live my life, Miss.

31:18.077 --> 31:20.212
I'm sure you got all
the best intentions,

31:20.312 --> 31:23.315
but I don't need
nobody to do that.

31:37.163 --> 31:38.697
<i>Come on in.</i>

31:42.868 --> 31:44.703
You have good news for us?

31:44.803 --> 31:46.572
We're actually

31:46.672 --> 31:47.839
kind of stuck right now.

31:47.940 --> 31:49.741
The only word
we have is that

31:49.841 --> 31:51.710
your grandson
succumbed to

31:51.810 --> 31:53.345
a stab wound
through the abdomen,

31:53.445 --> 31:55.847
and no murder weapon
has been recovered,

31:55.948 --> 31:57.916
though the ME thinks
it was scissors.

31:58.017 --> 31:59.751
I don't
understand how this

31:59.851 --> 32:01.620
could happen with people around.

32:01.720 --> 32:03.522
No one saw anything?

32:03.622 --> 32:04.590
We don't

32:04.690 --> 32:05.924
understand it, either.

32:06.025 --> 32:07.059
Tiffany,

32:07.159 --> 32:08.360
you mind taking

32:08.460 --> 32:10.329
a ride with us?
We won't keep you long.

32:11.330 --> 32:12.498
You want me?

32:13.465 --> 32:15.467
We were just about to go
pick up a prescription.

32:15.567 --> 32:16.702
No, we'll get it picked up.

32:16.802 --> 32:18.570
I still need to cook dinner.

32:18.670 --> 32:19.838
Well, you can get
something delivered.

32:19.938 --> 32:21.840
She doesn't like take-out,

32:21.940 --> 32:23.475
she's not gonna eat it.

32:23.575 --> 32:24.943
It's all
right, honey.

32:25.044 --> 32:27.246
You don't have to worry
about me, I-I'll be fine.

32:27.346 --> 32:29.315
Oh, okay.

32:29.415 --> 32:32.151
Um... I'll be back.

32:51.870 --> 32:55.174
The frescos were salvaged
from a church in Sienna.

32:55.274 --> 32:58.110
The brick work was done
by immigrant Italian masons,

32:58.210 --> 33:00.512
one of them related
to Nicola Sacco.

33:00.612 --> 33:01.647
They used
this church

33:01.747 --> 33:03.215
to raise money
for his defense.

33:03.315 --> 33:06.252
I don't think she knows
who Nicola Sacco was, Frank.

33:06.352 --> 33:08.354
Sacco and Vanzetti.

33:08.454 --> 33:11.623
Italian anarchists
executed for murder.

33:11.723 --> 33:13.692
You continue to
underestimate me, don't you?

33:14.960 --> 33:15.994
Your Excellency.

33:16.995 --> 33:18.530
Chief.

33:18.630 --> 33:20.132
How are you,
Allison?

33:20.232 --> 33:21.667
Been well, Your Excellency.

33:21.767 --> 33:24.336
Frank, because
Allison asked me

33:24.436 --> 33:26.405
to look into this
situation personally,

33:26.505 --> 33:27.773
because we've known each
other for a long time,

33:27.873 --> 33:29.475
I wanted to come
and tell you myself

33:29.575 --> 33:31.543
there doesn't appear
to be any way

33:31.643 --> 33:33.712
not to go through with the sale.

33:37.583 --> 33:39.151
Much as we believe in miracles,

33:39.251 --> 33:41.187
we don't necessarily
expect them.

33:41.287 --> 33:42.921
If we could save
the place, we would.

33:43.021 --> 33:44.523
I understand.

33:44.623 --> 33:46.158
Even if we were willing to
spend the million-and-a-half

33:46.258 --> 33:47.659
necessary to repoint
the masonry,

33:47.759 --> 33:49.628
the fact remains that
the Brooklyn Diocese

33:49.728 --> 33:51.230
is in contract
to sell the building.

33:51.330 --> 33:53.199
Has the buyer been approached?

33:53.299 --> 33:54.766
I spoke to their representative

33:54.866 --> 33:56.735
after I got the call from
Allison, and, in that they

33:56.835 --> 33:58.204
made the payment
needed to seal the deal,

33:58.304 --> 34:00.072
they're expecting
us to honor

34:00.172 --> 34:01.807
our end of the bargain.

34:01.907 --> 34:04.376
There's no getting
out of it. I...

34:04.476 --> 34:05.944
I'm sorry.

34:09.615 --> 34:11.983
I'll tell the parishioners.

34:15.754 --> 34:17.523
<i>From everything we've heard,</i>

34:17.623 --> 34:20.392
you take very good
care of your aunt.

34:20.492 --> 34:21.993
I do what has to be done.

34:22.094 --> 34:23.295
You do it.

34:23.395 --> 34:25.131
Yes, I do it. So what?

34:25.231 --> 34:27.699
I imagine that takes up
a lot of your time.

34:27.799 --> 34:30.402
I'm not complaining, am I?

34:32.204 --> 34:34.206
You have a particularly close
relationship with your aunt.

34:34.306 --> 34:35.974
I don't know if it's

34:36.074 --> 34:37.809
particularly close.

34:37.909 --> 34:39.911
She did stuff with me
when I was little

34:40.011 --> 34:44.150
that my own mother
couldn't or... didn't.

34:44.250 --> 34:47.018
Aunt Lillie took me out
to the botanical gardens,

34:47.119 --> 34:48.954
she took me out
on one of those boats

34:49.054 --> 34:50.756
they have down
at Sheepshead Bay,

34:50.856 --> 34:52.191
even though she was terrified

34:52.291 --> 34:53.225
of getting out on the water.

34:53.325 --> 34:54.260
Which is why you're

34:54.360 --> 34:56.362
so devoted to her now.

34:56.462 --> 34:59.030
There doesn't
have to be a reason.

34:59.131 --> 35:01.967
When I needed her to,
she took care of me.

35:02.067 --> 35:03.869
When she needs me,
I take care of her.

35:03.969 --> 35:05.904
That's what people
do for each other.

35:06.004 --> 35:06.905
Not all people.

35:07.005 --> 35:08.874
Right.

35:08.974 --> 35:10.476
Not all people.

35:10.576 --> 35:13.312
It usually falls on
one person, doesn't it?

35:13.412 --> 35:15.247
Where my mother
was concerned,

35:15.347 --> 35:17.082
that one person was me.

35:17.183 --> 35:20.152
So tell me, how-how was
your cousin as far as

35:20.252 --> 35:21.487
pitching in?

35:22.454 --> 35:23.689
He helped out sometimes.

35:23.789 --> 35:26.392
He was living
there, though.

35:26.492 --> 35:28.427
Yeah, he was living there.

35:28.527 --> 35:29.628
Did it get
any easier

35:29.728 --> 35:31.363
on you once he moved in?

35:31.463 --> 35:35.133
<i>You run yourself ragged,
and there's...</i>

35:35.234 --> 35:36.702
there's never enough you can do.

35:36.802 --> 35:39.037
Is your mom still with us?

35:39.137 --> 35:41.039
No.

35:41.139 --> 35:42.441
Been two years now.

35:42.541 --> 35:43.675
We know your cousin

35:43.775 --> 35:44.776
was going through
your aunt's money,

35:44.876 --> 35:46.512
Tiffany.

35:46.612 --> 35:49.147
Yeah... he was.

35:49.248 --> 35:50.949
Yeah, running up her
credit card bills,

35:51.049 --> 35:52.718
cashing her Social
Security checks...

35:52.818 --> 35:55.587
In her eyes,
he could do no wrong.

35:55.687 --> 35:58.557
Let me tell you something
about long-term caregivers.

35:58.657 --> 36:00.759
They start thinking
crazy things.

36:00.859 --> 36:02.828
Did you ever confront
your cousin?

36:02.928 --> 36:03.862
I tried to have

36:03.962 --> 36:06.532
calm conversations with him.

36:06.632 --> 36:08.099
What about the night
he was killed?

36:08.200 --> 36:10.836
I asked him if he could
contribute something.

36:10.936 --> 36:12.304
I told him that
I wanted to

36:12.404 --> 36:13.772
hire a home
health aide

36:13.872 --> 36:17.943
just so I could find
a different job, maybe,

36:18.043 --> 36:20.612
or have a little bit
more of a life.

36:20.712 --> 36:22.314
She's about to go for it.

36:22.414 --> 36:24.816
Did it get physical?

36:25.851 --> 36:28.119
Yeah, now is the time
you set the foundation

36:28.220 --> 36:29.321
for self-defense. Now.

36:29.421 --> 36:30.989
I'm going in there
for a second.

36:31.089 --> 36:32.458
You said it got physical.

36:32.558 --> 36:33.792
Why don't you
talk us through it?

36:33.892 --> 36:37.128
Excuse me. Ms. Edwards?
Captain Yenko.

36:37.929 --> 36:39.431
We don't want to put words
in your mouth,

36:39.531 --> 36:41.099
nor do we want you
to say anything

36:41.199 --> 36:43.134
that isn't 100% truthful.

36:44.135 --> 36:45.371
But if you did

36:45.471 --> 36:46.638
confront your cousin,

36:46.738 --> 36:48.874
and if that confrontation
became violent,

36:48.974 --> 36:51.377
if you were concerned
for your life,

36:51.477 --> 36:52.911
and that caused you

36:53.011 --> 36:55.647
to grab the scissors
out of self-defense,

36:55.747 --> 36:57.383
I think we agree

36:57.483 --> 36:58.584
that now is the time

36:58.684 --> 37:00.819
to say that.

37:11.697 --> 37:13.832
I thought he was gonna kill me.

37:14.933 --> 37:17.569
I had to
defend myself.

37:22.641 --> 37:24.510
Hey.
Hey.

37:24.610 --> 37:26.077
Heard they took Tiffany away.

37:26.177 --> 37:28.514
Yeah, I heard they wanted
to ask her a couple questions.

37:28.614 --> 37:31.016
Be a damn shame
if they charge her.

37:31.116 --> 37:32.518
Well, they'll only do
that if there's evidence

37:32.618 --> 37:33.719
that she committed a crime.

37:33.819 --> 37:34.820
It was up to
the people who live here,

37:34.920 --> 37:35.754
they wouldn't
do it regardless.

37:35.854 --> 37:36.988
Well, they got to do

37:37.088 --> 37:39.024
what they got to do.
Come to think of it,

37:39.124 --> 37:41.126
you're one of those
people who live here.

37:41.226 --> 37:42.461
Yeah, that's right.

37:42.561 --> 37:45.130
Maybe sometime you'll
tell me just how

37:45.230 --> 37:46.765
that came to pass.

37:47.866 --> 37:49.234
It's actually pretty straightforward.

37:50.436 --> 37:51.737
I doubt it.
No, really, I...

37:53.472 --> 37:54.973
Hey.
I was looking for you.

37:55.073 --> 37:56.775
I thought we could've
rode back together.

37:56.875 --> 37:58.777
I just... The bus was right
there, so I just hopped on.

37:58.877 --> 38:01.079
You the other cop
that moved in here?

38:01.179 --> 38:02.213
Yeah.

38:02.314 --> 38:03.248
Um, this is Lorenzo.

38:03.349 --> 38:04.583
What's up?

38:04.683 --> 38:05.684
What's up?

38:05.784 --> 38:07.419
Well, I'm gonna
take a shower.

38:07.519 --> 38:09.087
Do you want to do dinner?

38:09.187 --> 38:10.956
Not tonight.

38:11.056 --> 38:13.124
I'll see you
soon, Lorenzo. Later.

38:22.934 --> 38:24.135
Nice to meet you, Lorenzo.

38:24.235 --> 38:25.571
Yeah, you, too.

38:26.905 --> 38:28.340
Now, I've extended
you the courtesy

38:28.440 --> 38:29.941
of meeting you in a bar
and coming to your office,

38:30.041 --> 38:32.478
when I generally like
to conduct business

38:32.578 --> 38:33.679
out of my office.

38:33.779 --> 38:35.180
I appreciate.

38:35.280 --> 38:37.683
Yeah, well,
you are a two-star chief,

38:37.783 --> 38:39.017
and word out of Puzzle Palace

38:39.117 --> 38:41.353
has you being
appointed commissioner

38:41.453 --> 38:42.854
if Sharpe gets elected mayor,

38:42.954 --> 38:46.958
so it'd be silly not
to act somewhat deferential.

38:49.227 --> 38:53.765
Having attempted negotiation
with you and the diocese,

38:53.865 --> 38:56.267
I'm left with
the inescapable conclusion

38:56.368 --> 38:59.104
that I need to be
a little more direct.

39:00.906 --> 39:03.341
I want the contract of sale

39:03.442 --> 39:05.010
for St. Abigail's ripped up.

39:05.110 --> 39:07.879
I want that building
to remain a church,

39:07.979 --> 39:10.916
and any repairs
that are necessary...

39:12.518 --> 39:15.387
...they're gonna be paid for
by you. Personally.

39:16.488 --> 39:18.924
Okay.

39:19.958 --> 39:22.761
Uh, what, did you dream this up

39:22.861 --> 39:24.195
in fantasy
cops and robbers camp?

39:24.295 --> 39:26.732
Compel the sale of
that church to go forward,

39:26.832 --> 39:28.900
and you're gonna
have detectives

39:29.000 --> 39:31.737
from Brooklyn North to Manhattan
watching your every move.

39:31.837 --> 39:33.905
So you can
roll the dice,

39:34.005 --> 39:36.642
see if you'll dodge
prison a second time,

39:36.742 --> 39:38.376
but, uh,

39:38.477 --> 39:40.779
Vegas odds,

39:40.879 --> 39:42.748
they aren't in your favor.

39:47.886 --> 39:50.456
All right, Chief.

39:50.556 --> 39:52.724
I'll err on the
side of caution.

39:55.594 --> 39:57.863
This time.

40:08.474 --> 40:09.908
Yeah?

40:11.109 --> 40:13.344
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

40:13.445 --> 40:14.580
Georgia reminds me of

40:14.680 --> 40:16.214
Allyson Felix,
the way she comes

40:16.314 --> 40:17.783
out of
the blocks. Regina...

40:17.883 --> 40:19.117
And also,
before I forget,

40:19.217 --> 40:20.418
I also think that
we ought to let her

40:20.519 --> 40:21.687
give hurdling a shot.

40:21.787 --> 40:23.388
I mean, if that's
what she wants,

40:23.489 --> 40:24.556
it might be good for her.

40:24.656 --> 40:26.357
Regina.
Yeah?

40:26.458 --> 40:28.259
Georgia quit.

40:29.127 --> 40:30.629
She said she was quitting

40:30.729 --> 40:32.097
or she already quit?

40:32.197 --> 40:33.331
Well, she left me a voice mail

40:33.431 --> 40:34.466
saying that
she's quitting the club.

40:34.566 --> 40:36.502
Well, let me talk to her.

40:36.602 --> 40:38.269
I got personal with her,

40:38.369 --> 40:39.938
and this is her way
of telling me off.

40:40.038 --> 40:41.372
I don't think so.

40:41.473 --> 40:42.741
She wants
to crush that meet

40:42.841 --> 40:44.142
on Saturday, Sabrina.

40:44.242 --> 40:45.777
She's not gonna give up
on that so easily.

40:45.877 --> 40:48.379
She asked that neither
one of us contact her.

40:48.480 --> 40:51.416
It's better if we
just leave her alone.

40:51.517 --> 40:53.351
For now.

40:53.451 --> 40:54.686
Look, I got to go,
but we'll talk.

40:54.786 --> 40:56.154
Okay.
