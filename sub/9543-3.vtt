00:33.930 --> 00:35.923
All right. Here he comes.

00:35.958 --> 00:38.390
Mr. Hammond! Mr. Hammond!

00:38.425 --> 00:42.614
Mr. Hammond, the SEC Is saying
you purposely misled your investors.

00:42.649 --> 00:45.776
I can't comment on anything
the SEC says or does.

00:45.811 --> 00:48.227
As you know, I'm meeting
with the board of directors.

00:48.262 --> 00:50.686
I'll be able to tell you more about it
in the morning. Thank you.

00:50.721 --> 00:55.663
Mr. Hammond, is there a possibility
that charges will be filed? Mr. Hammond?

01:00.162 --> 01:03.133
I told you life with me
would be interesting.

01:03.168 --> 01:05.905
That one reporter was talking
about criminal charges.

01:05.940 --> 01:10.218
Don't worry about that.
I'll let you know when to worry.

01:11.923 --> 01:17.268
Skyline Hills.

01:17.303 --> 01:22.125
Skyline Hills Resort.
Estimated driving time: 32 minutes.

01:25.353 --> 01:29.840
Turn right onto Larkin Street.
Get in the right lane now.

01:32.179 --> 01:35.411
Scott Gregorio steps up to the plate,
You and your damn baseball.

01:35.446 --> 01:38.241
And the whole world knows
Gregorio is within four home runs...

01:38.276 --> 01:41.216
of breaking Darryl Grant's
all-time single season record.

01:41.251 --> 01:44.721
- Please. I'm trying to think.
- I just want to hear the score.

01:44.756 --> 01:46.832
He has six games to go.
We could very well...

01:46.867 --> 01:49.584
Continue on Grace Street for two miles.

01:57.256 --> 02:00.228
Here's the pitch. Gregorio swings,
and there it goes! He got all of that one!

02:00.263 --> 02:03.433
And it's gone! Home run number 71!

02:03.468 --> 02:07.784
Scott Gregorio's within three home runs
of the all-time record!

02:07.819 --> 02:11.794
Your destination is within three miles.

02:13.396 --> 02:15.606
- Where are we?
- It's a GPS system.

02:15.641 --> 02:17.668
It's programmed
to find the shortest route.

02:17.703 --> 02:20.565
Well, isn't it supposed to be on a lake?

02:24.864 --> 02:26.953
Right turn into driveway.

02:29.640 --> 02:32.707
Where the hell are we?

02:33.951 --> 02:37.252
You have arrived
at Skyline Hills Resort.

02:37.287 --> 02:39.431
The hell I have.

02:42.443 --> 02:45.707
Thank you for using
the Safe Voyage system.

02:46.553 --> 02:49.092
MONK Season 2 Epi. 03
Mr. Monk Goes to the Ballgame

03:49.952 --> 03:53.621
Come on! Come on, Jared!
Right over the plate!

03:54.880 --> 03:57.917
Come on, Benjy!
You can do it!

03:57.952 --> 04:01.309
Oh, my God. Oh, my God. I can't watch.
Adrian, tell me what's happening.

04:01.344 --> 04:03.714
- The three is crooked.
- What three?

04:03.749 --> 04:06.147
On the scoreboard.
Why doesn't he fix it?

04:06.182 --> 04:09.464
Adrian, I need you to watch the game.
How's he doing?

04:09.499 --> 04:13.511
- The one is upside down.
- You can't tell the one is upside down.

04:13.546 --> 04:18.736
I can tell. The whole scoreboard...
It's like some surreal, abstract art thing.

04:18.771 --> 04:21.378
Come on, Benjy! Grab a piece of it!

04:21.413 --> 04:25.361
Come on, Jared!
Right down the middle. He's no hitter.

04:25.396 --> 04:27.752
- He's not eligible.
- Who?

04:27.787 --> 04:30.075
Stottlemeyer's son, Jared.
I think he's 13.

04:30.110 --> 04:34.858
- He doesn't look 12, does he?
- Knock it out of the park, Benjy!

04:36.932 --> 04:39.291
- Come on!
- The numbers are crooked!

04:39.326 --> 04:43.972
Somebody fix the scoreboard!

04:44.007 --> 04:47.643
No wonder attendance is down.

04:47.678 --> 04:51.011
- Strike three! You're out!
- Yeah!

04:51.046 --> 04:53.663
Yes! Yeah!

04:56.933 --> 04:59.190
- Adrian, why don't you go talk to him?
- Me?

04:59.225 --> 05:01.835
Yeah. Give him a pep talk.
He respects you.

05:01.870 --> 05:05.862
- He does? Why?
- 'Cause he doesn't work for you.

05:06.917 --> 05:09.457
Good game. Good game. Good game.

05:09.492 --> 05:12.215
Good one.
Next time.

05:16.335 --> 05:19.721
- Is there a problem?
- Didn't your son repeat the third grade?

05:19.756 --> 05:23.692
- Yeah. So what if he did?
- How old is he?

05:23.956 --> 05:27.388
- He's 12.
- Jared, what year were you born?

05:27.423 --> 05:29.231
Don't answer that, son.

05:29.266 --> 05:30.265
All right. We're gonna huddle in the

05:30.266 --> 05:31.570
outfield, and then we're
goin' out for pizza!

05:31.605 --> 05:34.050
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

05:35.383 --> 05:37.364
All right. He's 13. But I have a special

05:37.365 --> 05:39.643
dispensation from the
league. He's eligible.

05:39.678 --> 05:41.686
How many parking tickets
did you have to fix for that?

05:41.721 --> 05:44.738
He is eligible, Sharona.
End of discussion.

05:44.773 --> 05:49.164
Excuse me.
This is Stottlemeyer.

05:53.041 --> 05:55.289
Hey! Hey, you looked good out there.

05:55.324 --> 05:58.456
What game were you watching?
I sucked.

05:59.243 --> 06:04.242
Yeah. You did, kind of.
Listen, Benjy, do me a favor,

06:04.277 --> 06:08.297
and, uh, just...your mom thinks
I'm givin' you a pep talk.

06:08.332 --> 06:13.143
Why? - I don't know. I don't know. Because
I'm a guy. You're... we're... two guys.

06:13.178 --> 06:17.018
I don't know. I don't know.
Look, just kind of nod your head

06:17.053 --> 06:20.104
and pretend I'm giving you
some good advice.

06:20.139 --> 06:23.721
- Okay.
- Great. Okay, so, um...

06:23.756 --> 06:25.932
- Oh, um... hands together.
- Like this?

06:25.967 --> 06:29.019
- Yeah. Uh-huh.
- Yeah. That's good. Nod your head.

06:29.054 --> 06:32.823
Smile. - Adrian. Adrian.
We've gotta go. We've got a job.

06:32.858 --> 06:35.836
- Lawrence Hammond was killed last night.
- The Lawrence Hammond?

06:35.871 --> 06:39.291
- And his wife.
- Okay. Um, listen, Benjy.

06:39.326 --> 06:41.275
Just keep practicin' that swing

06:41.310 --> 06:44.213
like we talked about, and we'll have
another lesson tomorrow. - Okay

06:44.248 --> 06:46.339
- Be careful.
- Okay, Mr. Monk.

06:46.374 --> 06:47.979
Thanks for everything. - Okay, pal.

06:48.014 --> 06:50.792
Honey, go home with Mrs. Cargill,
and I'll pick you up later, okay? - Okay

06:50.827 --> 06:54.401
- I love you. You did so good today, huh?
- Yeah. Right.

06:54.436 --> 06:57.299
He's gonna be okay.
He's gonna be fine.

06:59.063 --> 07:02.151
Hang on. Hang on. Hang on.
Back up.

07:03.522 --> 07:05.842
His sister just I. D.'d the body.
It's him.

07:05.877 --> 07:09.440
This is gonna be a circus.

07:09.475 --> 07:12.991
Give me your tie.
Give me your tie.

07:13.026 --> 07:16.459
How'd the game go?
Randy, this is a double homicide.

07:16.494 --> 07:20.681
- Sorry.
- I can't talk about the game.

07:20.716 --> 07:23.541
We beat 'em 3-1.

07:23.576 --> 07:25.286
Jared pitched the whole game.

07:25.321 --> 07:28.047
- He gave up two hits.
- Really? - - Yeah.

07:28.082 --> 07:30.469
Eight strikeouts.

07:30.504 --> 07:31.648
Bring them up to speed, all right?

07:31.683 --> 07:35.180
Walk 'em through it.
I gotta go do my dog and pony show.

07:35.215 --> 07:38.643
- Monk. Sharona.
- Lieutenant.

07:38.678 --> 07:41.985
- Is it really Lawrence Hammond?
- Yes, it is.

07:42.020 --> 07:46.016
- What was he doing here?
- We're just kicking that around now.

07:46.051 --> 07:50.448
We think he got lost or maybe
he was meeting someone.

07:50.483 --> 07:55.202
It doesn't make any sense.
Isn't that a... what do you call it?

07:55.237 --> 07:59.197
Global positioning system.
It was on, but it wasn't working.

07:59.232 --> 08:01.073
There was no disk in the computer.

08:01.108 --> 08:05.410
- Maybe somebody took it.
- Maybe.

08:11.045 --> 08:14.802
The shooter was here...
waiting.

08:14.837 --> 08:18.465
- Hammond drives up...
- Yeah. Right. We found the casings.

08:18.500 --> 08:20.983
The shooter comes in here...
pop, pop, pop, pop...

08:21.018 --> 08:22.944
- four rounds into the wife.
- Oh, my God.

08:22.979 --> 08:25.144
- He shot the wife first?
- Then Hammond.

08:25.179 --> 08:27.603
Hammond was shot once,
but it wasn't fatal.

08:27.638 --> 08:29.477
- He tried to get away.
- Oh, my God.

08:29.512 --> 08:31.307
He gets out, runs.

08:31.342 --> 08:35.582
The shooter gets back into his car,
runs him down. - Oh, my God.

08:35.618 --> 08:37.659
- Hammond still wasn't dead.
- Oh, my God.

08:37.695 --> 08:40.101
- In the morning, he crawled away.
- Oh, my God!

08:40.135 --> 08:42.969
He crawled for two and a half miles.

08:44.356 --> 08:47.295
Truck driver found him.
9:00 a. m. Near Route 12.

08:47.330 --> 08:50.788
- I'd like to talk to him.
- I'll get him.

08:52.012 --> 08:56.555
Captain,
he shot the wife first.

08:56.590 --> 08:58.483
Why would he do that?

08:58.518 --> 09:01.060
I would've done the husband first,
wouldn't you?

09:01.095 --> 09:04.168
I don't know, Monk.
It's never come up.

09:04.203 --> 09:07.569
He didn't even stick around
to make sure Hammond was dead.

09:07.604 --> 09:10.141
Maybe he got interrupted.

09:10.176 --> 09:15.055
He lured them here somehow...
to kill her.

09:15.090 --> 09:17.987
Who? The wife?
She's a nobody.

09:18.022 --> 09:21.863
Lawrence Hammond's worth a billion dollars.
He had at least 100 enemies.

09:21.898 --> 09:25.053
No. No, no, no, no.
Lawrence Hammond is an afterthought.

09:25.088 --> 09:27.994
- She was the primary.
- This is Norm Mosely

09:28.029 --> 09:29.931
He was the truck driver
who found Lawrence Hammond.

09:29.966 --> 09:32.516
Was Mr. Hammond dead
when you found him?

09:32.551 --> 09:36.634
He was barely hangin' on.
He died before the paramedics showed up.

09:36.669 --> 09:39.147
- Did he say anything?
- Yes, sir.

09:39.182 --> 09:41.549
He said, "Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

09:41.584 --> 09:45.923
- Come again?
- "Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

09:45.958 --> 09:47.223
- Is that it?
- Yes, sir.

09:47.258 --> 09:51.325
- You sure? - He said it, like,
five times. Then he died.

09:51.360 --> 09:53.249
"Girls can't eat 15 pizzas"?

09:53.284 --> 09:55.863
- What the hell does that mean?
- Well, it's true. They can't.

09:55.898 --> 09:57.630
It depends.
How many girls are we talkin' about?

09:57.665 --> 10:00.602
Hang on. Were there any girls nearby
eating pizza?

10:00.637 --> 10:05.836
No, sir. I figured he was delirious,
but he kept saying it.

10:06.208 --> 10:10.796
"Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

10:10.831 --> 10:16.069
Nah. No, no. Forget it. No.
Never mind. Never mind.

10:20.721 --> 10:22.691
Not too shabby, huh?

10:24.852 --> 10:27.886
Walk this way, please.

10:27.921 --> 10:33.265
- Trudy and I almost bought this house.
- Really?

10:33.300 --> 10:38.935
Adrian, you made a joke.
You were joking. You feeling okay?

10:40.997 --> 10:46.978
Hello. I'm Robin Jenkins.
I'm their...well, I was their housekeeper.

10:47.013 --> 10:50.762
Hello, Mrs. Jenkins.
I'm so sorry to bother you.

10:50.797 --> 10:53.558
Um, I'm Sharona Fleming,
and this is my boss, Adrian Monk.

10:53.593 --> 10:55.258
You're with the police?

10:55.293 --> 10:57.214
- Not really.
- Yes, I'm with the police.

10:57.249 --> 10:59.177
Used to be on the force. I was discharged.

10:59.178 --> 11:01.381
We help the police.
We're private consultants.

11:01.416 --> 11:05.267
- It's a long story.
- How long did you work for the Hammonds?

11:05.302 --> 11:10.802
Three years. I started a few weeks
before they were married.

11:11.524 --> 11:15.496
Oh, I am so sorry.
I know this is a really bad time...

11:15.531 --> 11:18.028
I don't know what I'm going to do.

11:18.063 --> 11:19.698
Can I have one of those?

11:19.733 --> 11:23.530
I'm sorry.
I only have four left.

11:23.565 --> 11:27.534
Um, we were hoping
we could look around a little.

11:27.569 --> 11:31.509
Oh, uh, certainly.

11:31.544 --> 11:37.081
There's nothing left to see.
The police were here all day yesterday.

11:37.116 --> 11:40.391
They took Mr. Hammond's computer
and boxes of papers.

11:40.426 --> 11:43.135
His office and his bedroom are a mess.

11:43.170 --> 11:45.552
His bedroom?
They had separate bedrooms?

11:45.587 --> 11:51.468
Yes. For the last year, Mr. Hammond slept
in the east wing. Follow me.

11:51.503 --> 11:55.595
Actually, I'd like to see her bedroom.

11:59.514 --> 12:04.406
You know, separate bedrooms
might've saved my marriage.

12:05.271 --> 12:09.240
- Was Mrs. Hammond a sports fan?
- Just baseball.

12:09.275 --> 12:11.537
She never missed a game.

12:11.572 --> 12:13.906
You know, it's not true
what the papers say.

12:13.941 --> 12:15.878
- What's that?
- About Mr. Hammond.

12:15.913 --> 12:19.538
They make him out to be greedy
and selfish, like a monster.

12:19.573 --> 12:22.233
But he wasn't like that at all.

12:22.268 --> 12:24.327
He was so kind.

12:24.362 --> 12:29.431
He never forgot your name or
your kid's name or your birthday.

12:29.466 --> 12:32.627
- What about her?
- Mrs. H?

12:32.662 --> 12:38.230
She liked to keep busy. She had
hobbies... horseback riding, painting.

12:38.265 --> 12:40.926
She painted that.

12:46.943 --> 12:51.409
"Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

12:51.444 --> 12:54.766
- Pardon me?
- Those were Mr. Hammond's last words.

12:54.801 --> 12:56.537
Does it mean anything to you?

12:56.572 --> 13:00.958
- "Girls..."
- "Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

13:00.993 --> 13:04.125
- What girls?
- We don't know.

13:04.160 --> 13:07.636
Maybe they've got stomachache...

13:07.671 --> 13:12.457
from the pizza. - No.

13:13.300 --> 13:15.890
All eyes on Scott Gregorio tonight
as he attempts to create history.

13:15.925 --> 13:18.099
No baseball fan could ever
forget this moment.

13:18.134 --> 13:19.195
It was three years ago.

13:19.230 --> 13:23.825
This is Darryl Grant hitting
his historic 73rd home run.

13:28.584 --> 13:30.854
The question now is how long
will that record stand?

13:30.889 --> 13:32.823
Scott Gregorio's within three home runs

13:32.858 --> 13:34.885
- with four games left to play.
- Scotty!

13:34.920 --> 13:37.633
If last night is any indication,
he's gonna be in trouble.

13:37.668 --> 13:40.171
Gregorio went 0 for 3 in Philly.

13:40.206 --> 13:41.558
He looked pretty shaky at the plate.

13:41.593 --> 13:43.170
He's choking.

13:43.205 --> 13:46.227
I was at the stadium Tuesday night.
He was on fire.

13:46.262 --> 13:49.651
Some guys just can't handle
the pressure, my friend.

13:49.686 --> 13:51.442
Not like you and me.

13:51.477 --> 13:52.697
Randy,

13:52.732 --> 13:55.910
where is that list of people who might
have had a grudge against Lawrence Hammond?

13:55.945 --> 13:58.233
Still workin' on it, sir.

13:58.268 --> 13:59.129
It's like a phone book.

13:59.164 --> 14:01.815
Everybody who had stock in the company
had a reason to hate the guy.

14:01.850 --> 14:04.670
Captain, do you have a minute?
I think we're onto something.

14:04.705 --> 14:08.944
- Erin Hammond was having an affair.
- Oh, again with the wife.

14:08.979 --> 14:11.918
There were four shampoo bottles
in her bedroom from the Newport Inn.

14:11.953 --> 14:14.066
Which is just two miles
away from her house.

14:14.101 --> 14:17.013
The concierge said that she's been there
two or three times a month with some guy,

14:17.048 --> 14:19.317
- but they never got a good look at him.
- Congratulations.

14:19.352 --> 14:22.508
Mrs. Hammond was having an affair.

14:23.602 --> 14:25.886
Yeah, all right.
Yeah. I can't ignore that.

14:25.921 --> 14:27.687
Um, go down to the Newport Inn.

14:27.722 --> 14:31.312
I want you to interview the staff
and bring a sketch artist. - Yes, sir.

14:32.421 --> 14:37.613
- Who's this?
- Scott Gregorio.

14:37.648 --> 14:43.202
He's a baseball player trying to break
the single-season home run record.

14:43.237 --> 14:47.940
Yeah. Monk, can we keep our eye
on the prize here? - Is he an artist?

14:47.975 --> 14:52.549
Yeah. He likes to do some painting
in his spare time.

14:54.080 --> 14:56.173
Adrian, you're wrong.
It is not the same artist.

14:56.208 --> 14:59.845
I know it's not the same artist,
but look at the window and the drapes

14:59.880 --> 15:02.118
and the church in the background.

15:02.153 --> 15:05.256
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.
You're right. It is the same church.

15:05.291 --> 15:08.768
So at some point, they were
both in the same room.

15:08.803 --> 15:11.140
W-Wait. So you're saying
Lawrence Hammond's wife...

15:11.175 --> 15:13.104
- His murdered wife.
- And Scott Gregorio...

15:13.139 --> 15:16.514
- Future Hall of Famer.
- Are connected?

15:16.549 --> 15:18.645
Bet on it.

15:26.321 --> 15:28.503
Adrian.. Adrian, you were right.

15:28.538 --> 15:31.609
This is the room.
Look at the drapes and the church outside.

15:31.644 --> 15:36.129
- They both must have taken this class.
- Oh, yes.

15:36.164 --> 15:40.419
Oh, no! Okay.
Sharona, I can't do this.

15:40.454 --> 15:42.461
Why? 'Cause he's naked?

15:42.496 --> 15:46.881
You've never seen a naked man
before? - No.

15:46.916 --> 15:50.502
Well, you've seen yourself naked, right?

15:51.835 --> 15:57.763
- Just once.
- All right. Let me do the talking.

16:00.594 --> 16:02.558
- Mr. Henley?
- Yes. I'm Frank Henley.

16:02.593 --> 16:05.517
Excuse me if I don't get up.
My regular model called in sick.

16:05.552 --> 16:07.687
Oh, that's okay.
We spoke earlier.

16:07.722 --> 16:09.358
I'm Sharona Fleming,

16:09.393 --> 16:12.002
and... Adrian... this is Adrian Monk.

16:12.037 --> 16:15.113
Hi. - Is this a bad time?

16:15.148 --> 16:18.302
Oh, no, no. Not at all. Please.
Make yourself comfortable. I am.

16:18.337 --> 16:20.718
Okay. That's it.
Sharona, let's go. Come on.

16:20.753 --> 16:23.289
- I can't. I just can't.
- What about the case?

16:23.324 --> 16:24.921
Forget about the case.
We can't win 'em all.

16:24.956 --> 16:26.382
So you're gonna let a murderer go

16:26.417 --> 16:30.055
because you can't talk
to a naked man?

16:30.090 --> 16:33.356
- Yes.
- Oh, come on.

16:33.391 --> 16:36.770
Mr. Henley, this is
only gonna take a minute.

16:36.805 --> 16:39.509
Um, Erin Hammond was a student
of yours last year, right?

16:39.544 --> 16:42.054
That's right. For one semester.

16:42.089 --> 16:44.598
God rest her soul.

16:44.633 --> 16:46.384
Do you draw, Ms Fleming?

16:46.419 --> 16:49.860
No, but my son, Benjy,
really has the gift.

16:49.895 --> 16:52.507
Didn't get it from me, though.

16:53.064 --> 16:56.598
- Mr. Monk, please don't touch anything.
- Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

16:56.633 --> 17:01.632
I understand Scott Gregorio, the baseball
player, was also a student of yours.

17:01.667 --> 17:06.415
- Did they know each other? - Look,
I don't wanna get anyone in trouble.

17:06.450 --> 17:09.222
Maybe they left together once or twice.

17:09.257 --> 17:11.563
They were both consenting adults.
Who am I to judge?

17:11.598 --> 17:14.848
That's a good point. Thank you.
Interview's over. Thank you.

17:14.883 --> 17:17.650
- Well, I guess that's it.
- That's it.

17:17.685 --> 17:18.804
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

17:18.839 --> 17:20.840
Anytime. Here. Wait. Wait.
Let me see you out.

17:20.876 --> 17:24.626
No. I can't... No. No. That's it.
We can see ourselves out. Just stay there.

17:24.661 --> 17:28.405
What is your problem?
The human body is a beautiful thing.

17:28.440 --> 17:32.480
No. It's not.
Did you hear what he said?

17:32.515 --> 17:35.137
Erin Hammond and Scott Gregorio
left together.

17:35.172 --> 17:36.152
So what does that mean?

17:36.187 --> 17:40.120
I don't know yet,
but I think it meant something to somebody.

17:40.155 --> 17:42.343
We haven't seen any home runs
for the last three games.

17:42.378 --> 17:43.721
What are you tellin' yourself?

17:43.756 --> 17:45.631
I've been in a slump before, Danny.

17:45.666 --> 17:47.451
I've been workin' with the coaches.

17:47.486 --> 17:50.431
All it takes is one good swing of the bat,
and I'm right back in this.

17:50.466 --> 17:53.412
- He's Benjy's hero. - I'm just
gonna take it one game at a time.

17:53.447 --> 17:54.781
I thought I was Benjy's hero.

17:54.816 --> 17:58.192
I've noticed last few games, you had
a little trouble with breaking pitches.

17:58.227 --> 17:59.736
What are you doing about that?

17:59.771 --> 18:04.391
Well, I took a little longer on B. P.
today, and I think I've worked it out.

18:04.426 --> 18:09.609
- He loved her.
- How do you know?

18:10.596 --> 18:13.142
Three more home runs.
Four games to go.

18:13.177 --> 18:15.292
Do you still think
you can catch Darryl Grant?

18:15.327 --> 18:17.864
I'm just trying to help
my team win ball games.

18:17.899 --> 18:19.563
That's all I'm focusing on right now.

18:19.598 --> 18:21.736
I appreciate you taking the time
to talk to us on your day off, Scott.

18:21.771 --> 18:23.602
Best of luck tomorrow.

18:23.637 --> 18:25.277
- I'm gonna get him.
- Scott.! Scott.!

18:25.312 --> 18:27.327
Hi. How are ya?
Thanks for comin' out.

18:27.362 --> 18:29.718
- Here you go. Here you go.
- Scott?

18:29.753 --> 18:35.518
Scott? No. No, no, no.
It's a note from my friend.

18:36.172 --> 18:38.511
I think you should read it.

18:46.443 --> 18:51.678
We think Erin was the real target
of the attack, not her husband.

18:51.713 --> 18:55.067
- Why would you say that?
- Think about it.

18:55.102 --> 18:59.655
Think about how you were
affected by her death.

18:59.690 --> 19:01.107
Your hitting streak.

19:01.142 --> 19:03.036
Maybe somebody's trying to distract you.

19:03.071 --> 19:05.229
I can't believe you said that.

19:05.264 --> 19:07.090
I know this sounds paranoid,

19:07.125 --> 19:08.971
but I was thinking the exact same thing.

19:09.006 --> 19:12.137
Maybe it was the same guy who
attacked you a couple of weeks ago.

19:12.172 --> 19:13.409
You heard about that, huh?

19:13.444 --> 19:15.894
Yeah. I was outside the stadium.
It was after a game.

19:15.929 --> 19:17.881
Some creep came at me
with a baseball bat.

19:17.916 --> 19:20.271
I fought him off.
He disappeared.

19:20.306 --> 19:22.929
- Did you get a good look at him?
- Nah. It happened too fast.

19:22.964 --> 19:25.768
It's when the team hired Hekyll
and Jekyll here to babysit me.

19:25.803 --> 19:27.967
What about the police?
What are they doing?

19:28.002 --> 19:31.686
Well, sometimes it takes them a day
or two to catch up with us.

19:31.721 --> 19:36.632
Meanwhile, I'm workin' on it
round the clock.

19:37.488 --> 19:42.321
I'm gonna get that other one
out in the bleachers. - Thank you.

19:42.356 --> 19:47.060
If there's anything I can do to help...
anything at all.

19:49.362 --> 19:50.958
Really?

19:52.831 --> 19:55.383
- Oh, good swing!
- Really?

19:55.418 --> 19:58.048
Yeah, you're a natural.
Just remember:

19:58.083 --> 19:59.793
Keep your weight on your back foot.

19:59.828 --> 20:02.684
Don't be afraid of the ball.

20:02.969 --> 20:06.264
- Yes!
- Good hit, Benjy!

20:06.299 --> 20:10.442
That is a double in any ballpark
in this country.

20:10.477 --> 20:12.857
Thank you, Adrian.

20:14.117 --> 20:17.312
I thought I'd thank you now,
'cause in a half an hour,

20:17.347 --> 20:20.364
you're probably gonna piss me off again.

20:20.399 --> 20:22.202
You're welcome.

20:28.657 --> 20:31.456
- Keep your eye on the ball.
- I miss her so much.

20:31.491 --> 20:35.679
They say when people lose a leg,
they can still feel it.

20:35.714 --> 20:36.997
That was better.

20:37.032 --> 20:40.280
- That's what it feels like.
- Keep your eye on the ball.

20:40.315 --> 20:41.792
I know.

20:43.858 --> 20:48.392
- Better. That was better.
- How do you just keep going?

20:48.427 --> 20:52.020
How do you keep working?

20:52.055 --> 20:56.723
When Trudy fell in love with me,
I was a detective.

20:56.758 --> 21:04.000
I was on the street breaking cases.

21:04.035 --> 21:06.126
So I keep working.

21:06.161 --> 21:12.791
I keep trying...
to be the man she loved.

21:12.826 --> 21:16.239
That's all you can do.

21:16.274 --> 21:20.554
Be the man she loved.

21:22.921 --> 21:26.631
Hey, Benjy.
Don't forget help.

21:26.666 --> 21:29.052
- What's help?
- H-E-L-P.

21:29.087 --> 21:33.725
Hands together. Elbows up.
Level swing. Patience.

21:33.760 --> 21:37.120
H-E-L-P. - Yeah.
It helps to remember it. It's...

21:37.155 --> 21:42.824
- What do you call it?
- Mnemonic device.

21:42.859 --> 21:46.787
Sharona, call the captain!

21:49.690 --> 21:54.676
G-C-E-1-5-P.
"Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."

21:54.711 --> 21:55.581
It was a mnemonic device.

21:55.616 --> 21:57.033
I understand.
That's good work, Monk.

21:57.068 --> 22:00.877
I remembered how the housekeeper said
Lawrence Hammond never forgot a birthday.

22:00.912 --> 22:04.018
A lot of successful people use little
tricks to memorize information.

22:04.053 --> 22:05.834
- I said I understand.
- Obviously,

22:05.869 --> 22:07.484
Hammond made up
the phrase to help him

22:07.519 --> 22:10.272
remember the license plate
of the car that ran him down.

22:10.307 --> 22:14.176
- "G" stands for "girl."
- Adrian. Adrian.

22:15.053 --> 22:18.478
He gets it, okay?
We all get it.

22:18.513 --> 22:22.494
- "Girls can't eat 15 pizzas."
- Captain, the car's hot.

22:22.529 --> 22:24.494
It was stolen from
the Presidio Sunday night.

22:24.529 --> 22:27.812
- Is this blood on the bumper?
- Yes, sir.

22:27.847 --> 22:30.643
We have a positive match.
It's Lawrence Hammond's.

22:30.678 --> 22:33.326
You ready for this?

22:33.361 --> 22:36.704
Ready for what?
Just say it, Randy. What?

22:36.739 --> 22:39.491
We found this underneath
the rear seat cushion.

22:39.526 --> 22:42.430
It's for one of those global positioning
systems. It's homemade.

22:42.465 --> 22:44.430
The guy programmed it himself.

22:46.837 --> 22:50.803
This is what he used to lure Hammond and
his wife to that industrial park. - Right.

22:50.838 --> 22:54.716
Start putting together a list of computer
geeks that can do that sort of thing.

22:54.751 --> 22:58.530
Yes, sir. There's more.

22:59.591 --> 23:01.661
And would you like to
share it with us, Randy?

23:01.696 --> 23:03.639
The shooter abandoned the car
in a parking lot.

23:03.674 --> 23:06.071
There was a security camera.

23:06.106 --> 23:08.442
We got a picture of him.

23:10.484 --> 23:13.823
That's it?
They can't clean that up?

23:13.858 --> 23:17.398
It is cleaned up.
I mean, he was 50 feet away.

23:17.433 --> 23:19.652
- Should I release it to the press?
- What's the point?

23:19.687 --> 23:21.961
I've seen better pictures of Bigfoot.

23:23.518 --> 23:25.397
Captain, I've seen this guy before.

23:25.432 --> 23:29.458
Who is he? - I can't remember,
but I know that face.

23:29.493 --> 23:34.623
I've seen him before.. somewhere.

23:41.143 --> 23:43.387
I know that face.

23:43.422 --> 23:48.155
I just cannot remember where I've seen it.

23:48.819 --> 23:55.409
Adrian.. Adrian, let's put the face aside
for a minute.

23:55.444 --> 23:58.537
Let's put the case aside for a while,

23:58.572 --> 23:59.909
and we're gonna talk about your life.

23:59.944 --> 24:04.282
I mean, after all, Adrian, that is
what you're paying me for, okay?

24:04.317 --> 24:08.112
So, I understand you've been
spending a lot of time with Benjy.

24:08.147 --> 24:12.466
- Now, how does that feel?
- Oh, he's a great kid.

24:12.501 --> 24:17.684
Yes, I know that.
I'm asking how does that feel?

24:17.719 --> 24:23.949
It hurts.
It hurts to be with him.

24:23.984 --> 24:29.120
Why? You and Trudy ever talk about
having kids?

24:29.155 --> 24:32.168
Trudy used to bring it up.

24:32.203 --> 24:35.319
I said there was no rush.

24:35.354 --> 24:38.209
We had all the time in the world.

24:38.244 --> 24:41.085
Could've, should've, would've.

24:41.120 --> 24:45.943
Okay. Well, I hate to end the session
on that note, but the hour is up.

24:45.978 --> 24:48.995
No, it's not. It's only been 57 minutes.

24:51.442 --> 24:54.985
How'd you do that?
You're wearing a watch? - No.

24:55.020 --> 24:57.596
- You could see my watch, right?
- No.

24:58.846 --> 25:03.233
- It's a gift. - And a curse.
- And a curse.

25:03.268 --> 25:06.311
Okay. Okay. So, uh,
we have a few more minutes left.

25:06.346 --> 25:08.740
What would you like to talk about?

25:11.728 --> 25:15.697
That face!
I have seen him before. I know it.

25:15.732 --> 25:17.655
I have seen that guy before.

25:17.690 --> 25:20.463
That guy... I have seen
him before; I know it.

25:20.498 --> 25:24.574
I have seen that guy before.

25:24.609 --> 25:26.375
So, Adrian, do you think
you've seen that guy before?

25:26.410 --> 25:28.201
I know I have.

25:28.236 --> 25:31.894
Mr. Monk, Mr. Turrow will see you now.

25:32.823 --> 25:34.855
For the best price and best quality,

25:34.890 --> 25:38.121
come into one...
of our many Bay Area locations today.

25:38.754 --> 25:41.847
Baseball's Darryl Grant can break
the single-season record...

25:41.882 --> 25:46.345
for home runs, but one thing he can't break
is any storm window made by Parson's.

25:46.380 --> 25:49.862
Swiss-tempered, double-laminated
safety glass to protect your home,

25:49.897 --> 25:51.787
you and your family.

25:51.822 --> 25:55.897
With Parson's storm windows, the only
break you'll be seeing is in the price.

25:55.932 --> 26:00.825
Darryl, I'm watchin' it right now.
I've seen it 20 times. Will you relax?

26:00.860 --> 26:05.158
No. The lighting's perfect.
You look great.

26:05.193 --> 26:07.891
Darryl, I'm gonna have
to call you back, all right?

26:07.926 --> 26:09.754
Who loves you? Right.
Well, who else loves you?

26:09.789 --> 26:11.761
Me! Why do you tease me like that?

26:11.796 --> 26:13.842
Excuse me. Excuse me.
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

26:13.877 --> 26:15.116
What are you doing?

26:15.151 --> 26:18.313
There was a bit of a smudge,
like an ink stain.

26:18.348 --> 26:19.424
I think I got most of it.

26:19.459 --> 26:22.796
No, no, no.
It's an autograph. - Oh?

26:22.831 --> 26:27.194
Yeah. It's a 1988 All-Star game ball
signed by Michael Jordan.

26:31.631 --> 26:34.142
Well, maybe he could sign it again.

26:34.177 --> 26:36.692
Sure. I'll just call Michael,
ask him to stop by.

26:36.727 --> 26:39.448
Thank God.
I'm so relieved.

26:41.035 --> 26:44.813
He's being sarcastic.

26:44.848 --> 26:46.709
Give it to me.

26:46.744 --> 26:50.460
So, what can I do for you, Mr. Monk?

26:50.495 --> 26:51.931
You represent Darryl Grant.

26:51.966 --> 26:54.001
I have that honor.
That was just him on the phone.

26:54.036 --> 26:54.873
Well, as you know,

26:54.908 --> 27:00.079
Scott Gregorio is very close to breaking
Mr. Grant's home run record.

27:00.114 --> 27:01.646
Not if he keeps having games
like he had last night.

27:01.681 --> 27:03.421
What was he? Like, 0 for 3?

27:03.456 --> 27:05.979
Well, we think somebody's trying
to get to Scott Gregorio

27:06.014 --> 27:08.481
either directly or indirectly.

27:08.516 --> 27:09.477
Get to him? What?

27:09.512 --> 27:11.573
Are you talking about that lunatic
with the baseball bat two weeks ago?

27:11.608 --> 27:14.346
We're talking about a murder
Friday night...

27:14.381 --> 27:17.564
of someone very close
to Scott Gregorio.

27:17.599 --> 27:20.341
Wait, wait, wait, wait. Hold it.
You're not saying...

27:20.376 --> 27:23.074
You can't be saying
you think Darryl Grant is involved?

27:23.109 --> 27:25.257
You can't deny he had a motive.

27:25.292 --> 27:27.992
It's his record Gregorio
is trying to break.

27:28.027 --> 27:30.209
Where was your client Friday night?

27:30.244 --> 27:32.325
Darryl Grant is a sportscaster now.

27:32.360 --> 27:34.265
He was in Chicago covering a doubleheader.
There was, like,

27:34.300 --> 27:37.101
two million people watching.
You want their names?

27:37.136 --> 27:38.636
He could've hired somebody.

27:38.671 --> 27:42.880
No, no, no. No.
Not Darryl Grant. Look.

27:42.915 --> 27:44.338
This was taken last year.

27:44.373 --> 27:47.672
This is Jerry Grierson breaking Darryl
Grant's single-season R. B. I. Record.

27:47.707 --> 27:50.412
Now, Darryl Grant was more proud of
that record than the home runs.

27:50.447 --> 27:52.076
But look at this.

27:52.111 --> 27:57.166
Darryl is the first guy
on the field to congratulate him.

27:57.201 --> 27:58.377
Darryl Grant's a mensch.

27:58.412 --> 28:01.572
He's a stand-up guy who realizes
that records are made to be broken.

28:01.607 --> 28:04.192
So I'm sorry to disappoint you, Mr. Monk.

28:04.227 --> 28:05.791
Do I owe you any money for cleaning up?

28:05.826 --> 28:10.863
- No, no. I don't want any money.
- He's joking again.

28:13.047 --> 28:16.817
I was joking... back.

28:17.669 --> 28:20.706
- Thank you.
- Right. Keep in touch.

28:21.502 --> 28:25.860
Come on, Jared! Big inning, son!
Big inning! Come on!

28:25.895 --> 28:28.392
- Crack that outfield, boy.
- Come on.!

28:28.427 --> 28:32.440
- Ball!
- Good eye! Good eye!

28:32.475 --> 28:37.267
I can't... I remember...
I know I have seen that guy before.

28:37.302 --> 28:39.319
Go Cyclones!

28:39.354 --> 28:42.112
Come on, Jared! Come on, boy!

28:42.147 --> 28:45.098
- Strike three! You're out!
- What?

28:45.133 --> 28:49.373
No, no, no, no, no. Walter. Walter,
he checked his swing.

28:49.408 --> 28:52.849
- Leland, he broke his wrists.
- He did not. I was standing right there.

28:52.884 --> 28:55.118
He didn't go around.
Jared, did you go around?

28:55.153 --> 28:57.471
Wait a minute.
You can't ask him.

28:57.506 --> 28:59.254
Yes, I can. Why not?
Why? Don't you trust him?

28:59.289 --> 29:02.504
Leland, sit down. I mean it.
You're out of line. - Oh, no, no.

29:02.539 --> 29:04.859
- You're out of line!
- Back in the dugout, Leland!

29:04.894 --> 29:08.113
Get your finger out of my face, Walter.

29:08.148 --> 29:11.210
What? You want the health department
to come visit your restaurant?

29:11.245 --> 29:16.976
I don't have to take this...
not for $20 a game. I quit!

29:20.667 --> 29:24.565
Walter... Walter, I'm sorry.

29:27.446 --> 29:29.852
He didn't go around.

29:31.165 --> 29:32.152
- He has some nerve.
- Excuse me.

29:32.187 --> 29:34.508
Someone said you don't have
a kid in this game.

29:34.543 --> 29:36.221
Okay. I'll leave.

29:36.256 --> 29:39.447
No. You don't have to leave.
It means you can be the umpire.

29:39.482 --> 29:43.006
- Oh, uh, no, I don't think so.
- Well, here's the thing.

29:43.041 --> 29:47.408
If we can't find an ump,
we gotta call this game.

29:50.219 --> 29:52.305
Benjy.

29:52.340 --> 29:57.905
Okay. We have a new umpire.
We'll pick it up where we left off.

30:04.195 --> 30:05.991
Monk?

30:17.625 --> 30:20.655
Let's go! Gonna play or what?

30:25.006 --> 30:28.718
All right, kids! Be alert!
You want the ball!

30:31.810 --> 30:37.529
Play ball!
Time... Time-out! Time-out.

30:45.060 --> 30:47.128
Play ball!

30:49.698 --> 30:54.282
Time-out. Time... Time...
Time-out. Time-out.

31:06.923 --> 31:10.344
Come on! Let's start!
Play ball!

31:10.379 --> 31:16.069
Adrian. Adrian!
It's okay. It's clean enough.

31:21.140 --> 31:23.678
Okay, guys.
We're gonna be here a while,

31:23.713 --> 31:25.954
so if anybody's got any homework
they need to do,

31:25.989 --> 31:29.027
they might as well get it out now.

31:29.741 --> 31:32.558
Come on! Come on!

31:40.708 --> 31:42.963
Play ball!

31:46.997 --> 31:49.255
Strike!

31:49.290 --> 31:53.131
Strike one. Ball... Ball one.
That was a ball.

31:53.166 --> 31:56.197
That was ball one. Ball one.

31:56.232 --> 32:00.160
No. No.
It was a strike. Strike.

32:01.396 --> 32:03.828
- Ball. Ball.
- Come on!

32:03.863 --> 32:07.328
Time! Time-out!

32:21.630 --> 32:23.350
Play ball!

32:38.338 --> 32:42.577
This is where you're gonna
have to carry. - Strike!

32:42.612 --> 32:45.399
Ball! Ball. Ball. Strike.

32:45.434 --> 32:51.077
Strike! Ball. Ball.

32:52.069 --> 32:55.034
Do over.

33:00.116 --> 33:02.280
Come on, Benjy!
You can do it!

33:02.315 --> 33:04.617
Eye on the ball!
Eye on the ball!

33:04.652 --> 33:09.338
H-E-L-P.

33:09.373 --> 33:12.544
Hands together.
Elbows up.

33:24.188 --> 33:30.745
- Good job, Benjy!
- Safe! He's safe!

33:36.253 --> 33:38.915
He's natural!
He's na.. I mean...

33:38.950 --> 33:42.736
Good job, Benjy!

33:42.771 --> 33:45.552
- That was a nice hit.
- Thanks, Mr. Stottlemeyer.

33:45.587 --> 33:46.752
Don't lose that.

33:46.787 --> 33:51.137
When you make it to the majors,
that's gonna be worth a fortune.

33:56.310 --> 33:58.396
Are you okay?

34:01.596 --> 34:06.012
You know who killed the Hammonds,
don't you?

34:06.490 --> 34:09.196
Adrian, you are a great detective.

34:09.231 --> 34:13.094
A terrible umpire, but a great detective.

34:14.013 --> 34:16.407
Captain, I've got that list
of computer programmers

34:16.442 --> 34:19.498
who worked on global positioning systems
in the Bay Area.

34:19.534 --> 34:22.271
Yeah? - And I checked them against
applications for gun permits.

34:22.306 --> 34:23.777
- And?
- Nothing.

34:23.813 --> 34:27.219
Captain.. Captain, I know
where I saw him. - Saw who?

34:27.255 --> 34:31.127
Him. He's on TV.
I've seen him a dozen times.

34:31.161 --> 34:33.746
- So have you. He is in a commercial.
- A TV commercial?

34:33.782 --> 34:35.976
For storm windows.
We made a copy of it.

34:36.011 --> 34:38.402
Your TV has a video player, right?

34:38.437 --> 34:42.467
What? - Your little TV...
the one you're always watching.

34:42.766 --> 34:48.331
- I don't have a TV.
- It's all right, Randy. Let's have a look.

34:51.650 --> 34:54.145
Can I make a prediction here?

34:54.179 --> 34:57.741
You're each going to say
"Oh, my God" twice.

34:57.776 --> 35:01.069
- Okay, okay. Here it is.
- Don't blink.

35:01.104 --> 35:04.297
Baseball's Darryl Grant can break
the single-season record for home runs,

35:04.332 --> 35:07.046
but one thing he can't break is
any storm window made by...

35:07.081 --> 35:08.873
- Oh, my God.
- Oh, my God.

35:08.908 --> 35:12.261
- Oh, my...
- Oh, my God.

35:12.877 --> 35:15.743
My God.

35:25.583 --> 35:30.220
Okay. Back door,
eyes open, armed and dangerous.

35:33.473 --> 35:36.730
- I knew I'd seen that guy before.
- Adrian, please.

35:49.744 --> 35:53.893
- Walker Browning?
- Toby! Toby, quiet!

35:53.928 --> 35:57.214
I'm Captain Leland Stottlemeyer,
San Francisco Police Department.

35:57.249 --> 36:00.819
This is Lieutenant Disher,
Adrian Monk, Sharona Fleming.

36:00.854 --> 36:04.685
- What's goin' on?
- May we come in, Mr. Browning?

36:04.720 --> 36:08.650
- What if I say no?
- Don't say no.

36:11.731 --> 36:15.989
Toby, no. Stay. Quiet.

36:17.932 --> 36:22.647
- Excuse me. Is that dog dangerous?
- Not to me.

36:22.682 --> 36:26.186
Mr. Browning, you worked for
Springbook Electronics in Palo Alto?

36:26.221 --> 36:28.947
Not anymore.
I got laid off in October.

36:28.982 --> 36:31.031
And you worked for their
global satellite division, though?

36:31.066 --> 36:32.823
Uh, that's right.

36:32.858 --> 36:35.179
Can I ask what this is all about?

36:35.214 --> 36:38.746
Whoa. Hey. Is that 73?

36:38.781 --> 36:44.021
Uh, yes, it is. Please don't...
don't touch it. - I won't.

36:44.056 --> 36:46.520
Must have been quite a day for you,
huh, catching that ball?

36:46.555 --> 36:49.613
Yeah. - That's a piece of
history right there.

36:49.648 --> 36:54.021
Yeah. I wasn't even planning on
going to the ballpark that day.

36:54.056 --> 36:57.855
Friend of mine had an extra ticket.
It's funny, huh?

36:57.890 --> 37:01.903
Just... Your whole life can change.

37:01.938 --> 37:04.888
- Just like that.
- Just like that.

37:05.489 --> 37:09.060
I understand you've been in touch with
an auction house in New York.

37:09.095 --> 37:10.929
- You sellin' the ball?
- That's right.

37:10.964 --> 37:13.748
Yeah. Toby and I are having
a little bit of a cash flow problem,

37:13.783 --> 37:16.570
so I figure the 500 grand could
come in handy.

37:16.605 --> 37:19.619
Five hund... No. That ball's worth,
like, three million dollars.

37:19.654 --> 37:22.714
- Ah, nah.
- What would happen, I wonder,

37:22.749 --> 37:26.965
if Scott Gregorio broke
Darryl Grant's record.

37:27.000 --> 37:29.291
- I don't know.
- I'll tell you what would happen.

37:29.326 --> 37:33.803
That three million dollar baseball would
suddenly be worth roughly... nothing.

37:33.838 --> 37:35.989
Yeah, but it doesn't matter, 'cause, uh...

37:36.024 --> 37:39.107
Well, the slump Gregorio's in,
he's not gonna be breakin' any records.

37:39.142 --> 37:42.372
You made sure of that,
didn't you, Walker?

37:42.407 --> 37:45.914
when you murdered the woman he loved.

37:46.030 --> 37:50.536
Catching that ball must have been
the best day of your life.

37:50.571 --> 37:53.414
A few weeks ago, you decided to sell it,

37:53.449 --> 37:55.958
but you discovered there
were no buyers...

37:55.993 --> 37:59.349
Because the record was about to be broken.

37:59.384 --> 38:01.977
So you panicked.
You had to protect your investment.

38:02.012 --> 38:04.568
You went after Gregorio
outside the stadium.

38:04.603 --> 38:06.969
You were trying to break a leg
or an arm or anything

38:07.004 --> 38:10.414
to keep him out of the lineup.
But that didn't work.

38:10.449 --> 38:13.159
After that, he was surrounded
by bodyguards 24/7.

38:13.194 --> 38:15.479
You knew you'd never have another chance.

38:15.514 --> 38:17.807
But he was vulnerable in another way.

38:17.842 --> 38:22.111
He was in love with Lawrence
Hammond's wife, and you knew it.

38:22.501 --> 38:25.863
Okay, has that dog been fed recently?

38:25.898 --> 38:29.677
Hammond the millionaire?
This is insane.

38:29.712 --> 38:32.029
You knew Hammond's schedule.

38:32.064 --> 38:34.426
The board of directors meeting
was well publicized.

38:34.461 --> 38:35.629
The night before,

38:35.664 --> 38:39.202
you broke into his garage
and replaced his global positioning disk...

38:39.237 --> 38:42.257
with one you programmed yourself.

38:43.717 --> 38:49.221
Hammond followed the directions,
and all you had to do was wait.

38:51.979 --> 38:54.689
And all because you wanted
to sell a baseball.

38:54.724 --> 38:57.702
No, no. No.
You can't prove any of this.

38:57.737 --> 39:00.982
Here's a little tip for you, Walker.
Next time you wipe down a stolen car,

39:01.017 --> 39:04.502
make sure that you get the adjustment bar
under the driver's side seat,

39:04.537 --> 39:08.489
because we lifted a thumbprint,
and I'm betting it's yours.

39:08.755 --> 39:10.990
- Toby! Achtung.!
- I'm done, right?

39:11.025 --> 39:13.004
- I think I'm done. Am I done?
- Stop. Stop. Monk, stop!

39:13.039 --> 39:16.004
- I'm just gonna leave.
- Get it!

39:18.629 --> 39:21.677
- Here we go.
- Toby. Good dog.

39:21.712 --> 39:25.211
Good boy. Good boy.
Give me the ball. Ball!

39:25.246 --> 39:28.717
- Toby, give the ball to the captain.
- Give me the ball.

39:28.752 --> 39:30.898
Good boy, Toby.

39:30.933 --> 39:34.423
Toby... Toby, release!

39:34.458 --> 39:37.484
- Okay. Just give me the ball.
- Monk?

39:37.519 --> 39:40.156
Toby, sit.

39:44.163 --> 39:46.105
Uh, I've never been good with animals.

39:46.140 --> 39:49.949
Go! Go! Fetch! Get the ball!
Get the ball! - Toby?

39:49.984 --> 39:52.118
Toby, heel. Toby, freeze.

39:52.153 --> 39:55.268
Heel! Heel! Heel! Get the dog!

39:58.913 --> 40:01.701
Scott, you were on pace to break
the all-time home run record.

40:01.736 --> 40:03.710
You fell three short.
Are you disappointed?

40:03.745 --> 40:05.696
Of course I am.
I'd be lying if I said I wasn't.

40:05.731 --> 40:08.334
Do you have any comment
about the arrest of Walker Browning?

40:08.369 --> 40:10.300
According to the district
attorney's office,

40:10.335 --> 40:12.817
you were the reason he killed
Mr. And Mrs. Hammond.

40:12.852 --> 40:16.595
Please. That's my private life.
I'd like to keep it that way.

40:16.630 --> 40:22.732
But I would like to say
I met a man recently.

40:22.767 --> 40:24.830
He's become a good friend.

40:24.865 --> 40:29.027
He reminded me there are a lot more
important things in life than baseball.

40:29.062 --> 40:32.569
What matters most are
the people you love.

40:32.604 --> 40:37.623
Being true to them or their memory...
that's the real ball game.

40:37.658 --> 40:42.803
My friend isn't giving up on that,
and neither am I.

40:42.838 --> 40:45.428
I'll see you all in spring training.

40:51.248 --> 40:55.025
I wish you were at the game yesterday.
Benjy hit two singles and a double.

40:55.060 --> 40:58.047
- I'm so proud of him.
- You should be.

40:58.082 --> 41:01.161
Next time, he's gonna bat cleanup.

41:01.196 --> 41:04.705
Sounds like something you would do.
Cleanup. Get it?

41:04.740 --> 41:06.962
Yeah, I get it.

41:10.404 --> 41:13.148
Is that Browning's dog?

41:13.183 --> 41:16.025
I think that's the baseball.

41:16.060 --> 41:22.218
Oh, my God. Toby! Toby!
Drop the ball. Drop it.

41:25.047 --> 41:28.338
Oh... God.

41:28.373 --> 41:30.686
- It's all chewed up.
- Ohh.

41:30.721 --> 41:35.920
- It's a pretty expensive chew toy.
- It sure is.

41:35.955 --> 41:38.348
Well, it's kind of fitting,
though, don't you think?

41:38.383 --> 41:42.980
What? - Nobody ends up with the money.
A dog chews it all up.

41:43.015 --> 41:46.226
This dog just chewed up
three million dollars,

41:46.261 --> 41:49.244
and I can't even afford a tank of gas.

41:49.279 --> 41:52.561
So you're holding, what,
about $20,000 right there.

41:52.596 --> 41:57.113
You could put three, four tanks of
premium in your car with that.

41:57.148 --> 42:00.061
You know what?
Consider that a Christmas bonus.

42:00.096 --> 42:02.009
Like you would ever give me
a Christmas bonus.

42:02.044 --> 42:05.261
I want you to go out...
and buy yourself something pretty.

42:05.296 --> 42:07.705
Yeah. Right.

42:07.740 --> 42:11.715
Don't save it.
You don't have to save the money.
