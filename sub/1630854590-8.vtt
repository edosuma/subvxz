* MTV...

00:12.910 --> 00:14.830
Stabbed them both?

00:15.030 --> 00:17.350
Beat and choked Sister Mary.

00:18.710 --> 00:20.450
- May I see the child's
bedroom, please?

00:25.490 --> 00:26.490
[sniffs]

00:30.860 --> 00:32.610
She took all her belongings?

00:32.810 --> 00:34.430
- They don't have
any belongings.

00:37.000 --> 00:38.420
- Did another girl
leave with her?

00:38.620 --> 00:39.540
She was alone.

00:40.670 --> 00:41.670
Where's that girl?

00:44.310 --> 00:46.560
That girl passed.

00:46.760 --> 00:48.530
Passed how?

00:48.730 --> 00:51.850
[music]

00:58.790 --> 01:01.010
Children die, Marshal.

01:01.210 --> 01:02.980
These Indians are like wolves.

01:03.180 --> 01:05.240
Few thrive in captivity.

01:05.450 --> 01:07.150
- How many die a year,
would you say?

01:07.350 --> 01:09.270
Enough to warrant a graveyard.

01:13.500 --> 01:14.990
You sent men after her?

01:15.190 --> 01:17.940
- Three.
A week ago.

01:19.240 --> 01:20.580
- Which way?
- East.

01:22.480 --> 01:23.830
They followed her tracks.

01:24.030 --> 01:26.770
And they haven't returned?

01:26.970 --> 01:28.530
This is no land
to wander aimlessly.

01:28.730 --> 01:30.440
You must travel water to water.

01:30.640 --> 01:32.100
They are capable men.

01:32.310 --> 01:35.510
- If they were capable men
they would have returned.

01:35.710 --> 01:37.240
I'll come back with deputies,
we will set off from here.

01:37.440 --> 01:38.740
I trust you can ride?

01:38.940 --> 01:40.710
You wish me with you?

01:40.910 --> 01:42.450
I require it.

01:42.650 --> 01:44.620
We don't know what
she looks like.

Jake: Pretty smart, huh?

05:31.980 --> 05:33.680
Damn things is everywhere now.

05:33.880 --> 05:36.300
- Everyone sure is in
a hurry to change the world.

05:41.140 --> 05:44.190
- Hey!
Where's the hitching rails?

05:44.390 --> 05:45.710
- Took 'em out for
the parking spaces.

05:48.410 --> 05:49.580
Hup.

05:53.280 --> 05:54.280
Whoa.

05:56.720 --> 05:58.770
Hey, what are you doing?

05:58.970 --> 06:01.270
- They took away
my parking spot.

06:01.470 --> 06:02.730
I'm gonna make another one.

06:09.600 --> 06:12.380
- He got lawyered up
pretty quick.

06:12.590 --> 06:14.620
I don't recognize 'em, though.

06:14.820 --> 06:17.760
- Firm out of Helena.
The Governor's firm.

06:17.960 --> 06:19.610
Whitfield Mining's firm, too.

06:23.010 --> 06:24.010
All rise.

06:29.550 --> 06:30.590
Be seated.

06:34.860 --> 06:37.640
Judge: Banner Creighton...

06:37.840 --> 06:39.850
you have been charged with two
counts of murder, and...

06:40.050 --> 06:41.510
four counts of attempted murder.

06:41.710 --> 06:43.080
Do you wish to enter a plea?

06:43.280 --> 06:44.980
Not guilty, your honor.

06:45.180 --> 06:46.950
- I will set
a bail hearing for...

06:47.150 --> 06:48.940
- If council could approach,
your honor.

06:53.640 --> 06:57.230
Your Honor, the prosecutor
is unaware

06:57.430 --> 06:59.730
of the allegations
against Commissioner Dutton

06:59.930 --> 07:03.100
that agents of his commission
hanged four men

07:03.300 --> 07:05.040
without benefit
of trial by jury,

07:05.240 --> 07:07.340
one of whom was
the defendant himself.

07:07.540 --> 07:09.410
Our claim is self defense.

07:09.610 --> 07:11.180
Mister Creighton
is heavily invested

07:11.380 --> 07:13.310
in business dealings
in this community,

07:13.510 --> 07:14.480
and poses no flight risk.

07:14.680 --> 07:16.110
- You have proof
of these allegations?

07:16.320 --> 07:19.620
- I have rope burns around
the defendant's neck

07:19.820 --> 07:21.990
and letters from deceased
mens' widows wondering

07:22.190 --> 07:24.620
why money is no longer
sent back to Scotland.

07:24.820 --> 07:28.090
My client being held without
bail for multiple murder charges

07:28.290 --> 07:32.160
when no such charges exist
against Commissioner Dutton,

07:32.360 --> 07:36.600
creates a contradiction
worthy of scrutiny.

07:36.800 --> 07:41.240
I feel confident in asking
for a dismissal, your honor,

07:41.440 --> 07:44.410
much less release with
no bail until trial.

07:44.610 --> 07:46.410
What's your position?

07:46.610 --> 07:49.420
- Commissioner Dutton has
a reputation for being harsh,

07:49.620 --> 07:51.880
but none have ever
questioned the man's word.

07:52.080 --> 07:55.220
A conviction is warranted
on that alone.

07:55.420 --> 07:57.320
I ask he be held
without bail, your honor.

07:57.520 --> 07:59.290
- I have an arrest warrant
issued on the testimony

07:59.490 --> 08:02.090
of numerous witnesses,
but no physical evidence,

08:02.290 --> 08:04.530
This warrant was
prematurely issued.

08:04.730 --> 08:07.500
But I'll give your office
the opportunity to find evidence

08:07.700 --> 08:08.780
to support the charge.

08:09.890 --> 08:10.970
Your client is
released without bail.

08:11.170 --> 08:12.350
[pounds gavel]

08:16.160 --> 08:19.260
- Don't look back.
Don't speak. Let's go.

08:22.060 --> 08:24.050
- Know what I'm looking at?
Lawyer: Don't speak.

08:24.250 --> 08:25.820
- I know exactly
what you're looking at.

08:26.020 --> 08:28.650
- I'm looking at a ghost.
You fucking coward.

08:28.850 --> 08:30.390
Tryin' to settle this in court?

08:30.590 --> 08:32.590
- I'll show you coward.
- Hey!

08:32.790 --> 08:34.210
- I'm guessing the blonde
didn't make it.

08:36.410 --> 08:37.760
- There will be no fighting
in this courtroom!

08:37.960 --> 08:39.400
I will hold you all in contempt

08:39.600 --> 08:41.100
and you can fight it
out in a jail cell.

08:41.300 --> 08:43.600
- You keep sending boys
to do a men's work, Dutton.

08:43.800 --> 08:47.140
I guess if was as old as
you, I'd send boys, too.

08:47.340 --> 08:48.340
This don't end in a court.

08:48.540 --> 08:51.480
It ends in a field in front
of your fucking house.

08:51.680 --> 08:54.250
- If that's where you want to
die, I'm more than happy

08:54.450 --> 08:55.700
to help you out.

08:57.400 --> 08:59.030
[music]

09:08.440 --> 09:10.450
[indistinct chatter]

09:23.290 --> 09:24.530
Welcome aboard, ma'am.

09:29.430 --> 09:31.480
Alex: I dread seeing London.

09:31.680 --> 09:32.670
Spencer: You won't see it long.

09:34.740 --> 09:36.340
- I miss Africa.
Do you miss it?

09:38.640 --> 09:40.510
- Got my favorite thing
about Africa right here.

09:45.310 --> 09:46.310
My God.

09:50.690 --> 09:52.800
Alex: Any chance we can
take another ship?

09:53.010 --> 09:56.010
- There's five thousand
people on this boat.

09:56.210 --> 09:58.110
If you don't wanna see
'em you don't have to.

09:58.310 --> 10:00.800
- That's not how life works.
They'll be around every corner.

10:02.970 --> 10:05.220
We'll just hide in our
room for three weeks.

10:05.420 --> 10:06.840
Plannin' on doing that anyway.

10:09.710 --> 10:12.370
[music]

10:21.450 --> 10:23.470
Where do we go?

10:23.670 --> 10:25.740
Not sure.

10:25.940 --> 10:27.290
Thinking south.

10:28.360 --> 10:29.710
How far south?

10:29.910 --> 10:32.610
- I know some Comanche
on the Washita River.

10:32.810 --> 10:34.800
It'd be easy to
disappear there.

10:40.700 --> 10:42.100
Thank you.

10:46.170 --> 10:48.730
- Hey.
None of that.

10:48.930 --> 10:50.830
No goo-goo eyes,
no holding hands.

10:51.030 --> 10:52.580
No falling in love.

10:59.490 --> 11:01.560
If they find us,
they will kill us.

11:04.660 --> 11:09.600
Hang us from a tree
and bury our bodies face down.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.380
All your focus should
be on surviving.

11:13.590 --> 11:15.040
Fall in love later.

11:21.540 --> 11:24.150
- They've been trying to
kill me since they took me.

11:25.380 --> 11:26.920
I don't believe in later.

11:28.620 --> 11:31.150
I believe in right now.

11:35.020 --> 11:36.020
Ach...

11:38.260 --> 11:39.430
Women.

11:41.960 --> 11:46.580
[music]

11:46.790 --> 11:48.300
Is he gonna beat me up?

11:50.240 --> 11:51.470
- Maybe.
[sniffs]

11:52.670 --> 11:54.830
What are you going to do?

11:55.030 --> 11:56.110
You gonna let go?

12:06.150 --> 12:07.890
- I've had my
fair share of beatings.

12:09.930 --> 12:11.060
What's one more?

12:25.040 --> 12:26.840
We leave before the sun wakes.

12:30.810 --> 12:33.980

[sobbing continues]

13:25.330 --> 13:27.420
Creighton: I want him
fucking dead!

13:27.620 --> 13:31.260
I want his fucking wife dead,
that smug fucking boy...

13:31.460 --> 13:32.990
the whole fucking clan.

13:33.190 --> 13:35.160
Is that really what you want?

13:35.360 --> 13:37.000
- You bet your fucking ass
it's what I want.

13:37.200 --> 13:39.000
Wouldn't you rather be rich?

13:39.200 --> 13:40.370
I'm already rich.

13:40.570 --> 13:42.370
You have <i>some</i> money.

13:42.570 --> 13:44.450
That doesn't make you rich.

13:45.890 --> 13:48.770
The Yellowstone
will make you rich.

13:48.970 --> 13:50.340
True wealth is generational.

13:50.540 --> 13:53.140
I could never spend all
the money I've made.

13:53.350 --> 13:54.810
What I do now ensures

13:55.010 --> 13:58.650
that my great-grandchildren
can't either.

13:58.850 --> 14:02.850
If you think about it,
generational wealth

14:03.060 --> 14:08.460
is the closest thing a man
can have to immortality.

14:08.660 --> 14:12.160
When a building
has your name on it,

14:12.360 --> 14:13.770
that's immortality.

14:13.970 --> 14:17.370
And you don't achieve
that from prison.

14:17.570 --> 14:20.670
If you wrangle some posse
to descend upon his home,

14:20.870 --> 14:22.470
prison is where
they'll send you.

14:22.670 --> 14:25.110
Vengeance will never
make you money.

14:25.310 --> 14:29.160
You must set a goal, then
formulate a plan to achieve it.

14:30.330 --> 14:34.350
Then you execute it
without mercy.

14:34.550 --> 14:37.890
Emotion fuels every
decision Dutton makes.

14:38.090 --> 14:39.310
He loves his land.

14:43.210 --> 14:44.750
He loves it.

14:46.110 --> 14:47.770
And we will take it from him.

14:47.970 --> 14:50.740
You won't need a gun, Banner.

14:50.940 --> 14:53.240
We can kill him with this.

14:53.440 --> 14:56.060
[footsteps]

15:01.200 --> 15:02.780
She's awake.

15:02.980 --> 15:04.270
Oh, splendid.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.770
Feel like some sport?

15:08.040 --> 15:09.790
My wife came to town.

15:09.990 --> 15:11.570
Well, no fun for you then.

15:13.710 --> 15:17.380
- I've procured some
new toys for you, Lindy.

15:18.580 --> 15:20.420
I'm sure you'll like them.

15:21.750 --> 15:23.490
[music]

15:26.590 --> 15:27.860
Whitfield: Lindy.

15:51.110 --> 15:52.950
[whimpers]

15:54.320 --> 15:56.500
No more...

15:56.700 --> 15:57.620
Please.

15:59.490 --> 16:01.060
Lindy...

16:02.220 --> 16:03.390
Come here, sit down.

16:14.370 --> 16:18.310
You think I take pleasure
from her pain, don't you?

16:23.480 --> 16:25.480
Her pain means nothing to me.

16:27.520 --> 16:29.950
I don't care if it hurts.

16:32.650 --> 16:34.820
I don't get
my pleasure from her.

16:36.220 --> 16:38.260
I get it from you.

16:39.430 --> 16:40.750
From me?

16:40.950 --> 16:42.550
- Mm-hm.

16:42.750 --> 16:45.980
And it could be pleasurable
for both of us.

16:46.190 --> 16:49.090
But you can't focus
on the pain,

16:49.290 --> 16:51.610
just the pleasure
it gives you.

16:53.740 --> 16:55.180
- [voice breaking]
- I don't...

16:56.740 --> 16:58.310
See the pleasure in it.

17:02.480 --> 17:03.920
The pleasure's in the power.

17:05.990 --> 17:09.110
Try it again...

17:09.310 --> 17:12.280
and think
of the power you have.

17:12.480 --> 17:15.530
Mmm? Mm?

17:21.770 --> 17:23.210

Yes.

[exhales]

17:56.150 --> 17:57.410
Yes, Lindy.

17:59.340 --> 18:00.780
You see what I mean?

18:03.210 --> 18:05.080
Christy, stand up.

18:07.010 --> 18:07.900
It's your turn.

18:12.570 --> 18:13.790
Lay down.

18:17.130 --> 18:18.330
Lay down.

18:27.340 --> 18:28.540
Let me have the belt.

18:35.080 --> 18:40.150
Now remember, not a sound.

18:41.850 --> 18:44.320
I bet I don't have
to tell you twice.

18:54.160 --> 18:55.560

19:24.210 --> 19:26.440
They're gonna trample
more then they eat.

19:26.650 --> 19:28.550
Snow came early this year.

19:28.750 --> 19:29.910
Winter ain't here to stay yet.

19:30.110 --> 19:31.350
Better not be...

19:31.550 --> 19:33.950
We don't have enough hay to
start feeding in November.

19:34.150 --> 19:36.320
Zane: We ain't got enough hay
no matter when it snows.

19:36.520 --> 19:38.110
What do we do if it runs out?

19:39.340 --> 19:41.040
[music]

19:53.460 --> 19:54.810
- Hey, Jake, how long
you gonna be?

19:55.010 --> 19:57.380
- Only thing that happens
fast at a bank

19:57.580 --> 19:59.380
is deposits and robberies.

19:59.580 --> 20:01.010
- Thinking about slipping over
and seeing the family.

20:01.210 --> 20:02.810
Always time for that.

20:03.010 --> 20:04.320
- Meet you back here
in a few hours?

20:04.520 --> 20:06.780
- Yeah, we can pitch hay to
cattle without you
for a little bit.

20:06.990 --> 20:08.590
Spend some time
with the family.

20:08.790 --> 20:10.290
- Ain't the cattle
I'm worried about, sir.

20:10.490 --> 20:11.460
But I'll take the night
if you're alright with it.

20:11.660 --> 20:13.060
I'm alright with that, Zane.

20:13.260 --> 20:14.740
See you boys tomorrow.

20:20.280 --> 20:24.150
[music]

20:47.310 --> 20:48.810
[sighs]

20:49.980 --> 20:51.860
- I can't do another
loan on the cattle

20:52.060 --> 20:54.500
because there's no way
to lock in a value.

20:54.700 --> 20:57.770
If you had easy access to
the rail with them, then maybe,

20:57.970 --> 20:59.670
but you won't until April,

20:59.870 --> 21:01.690
and who's to say what
they're worth in April.

21:04.030 --> 21:07.650
- Well, they're worth more than
the loan, I can tell you that.

21:07.850 --> 21:09.850
All I need is enough hay
to get to spring.

21:10.050 --> 21:12.650
And when is that, Jake?

21:12.850 --> 21:14.690
April, June?

21:14.890 --> 21:16.590
We don't know.

21:16.790 --> 21:18.520
Where you going to
get the hay from,

21:18.720 --> 21:20.230
and how are you going
to transport it?

21:20.430 --> 21:22.030
Your road is snowed in
till spring as well.

21:22.230 --> 21:24.230
We'll haul it in wagons.

21:24.430 --> 21:27.160
- We have gotten killed on
these cattle loans, Jake.

21:27.370 --> 21:28.600
We're at a twenty percent
default rate.

21:28.800 --> 21:31.070
Not by me.

21:31.270 --> 21:33.440
I paid off my loan.

21:33.640 --> 21:35.910
When others walked away,
I paid mine off.

21:36.110 --> 21:39.010
- It's a bad investment for us,
and a big risk for you.

21:39.210 --> 21:40.510
With no upside.

21:40.710 --> 21:43.160
You're losing money this year
whether you buy feed or not.

21:46.970 --> 21:51.060
Let me propose something that
makes more sense for both of us.

21:51.260 --> 21:52.420
Take out a mortgage.

21:52.620 --> 21:54.560
Interest rates are below
six percent,

21:54.760 --> 21:56.190
you have thirty years
to pay it back.

21:56.390 --> 21:59.230
- I don't don't thirty years
for anything, Kyle.

21:59.430 --> 22:01.070
I'm seventy-eight years old.

22:01.270 --> 22:02.930
I'm not going to give
my family debt.

22:03.130 --> 22:05.170
- You're giving them
debt either way:

22:05.370 --> 22:08.410
you can't sell the calves
for what the hay costs.

22:08.610 --> 22:10.440
Money is my business.

22:10.640 --> 22:14.110
A mortgage is smart,
it's safe, and it gives you

22:14.310 --> 22:18.450
or your family
the luxury of time.

22:18.650 --> 22:21.940
- Only a banker would consider
a mortgage a luxury.

22:25.010 --> 22:26.870
We used to do this
with a handshake.

22:28.440 --> 22:31.760
- Sadly, enough handshakes
weren't worth the grip, Jake.

22:31.960 --> 22:34.080
Now none of them are.

22:35.550 --> 22:37.620
[music]

22:42.990 --> 22:45.390
[indistinct chatter]

23:04.550 --> 23:07.100
- Either you made a deposit
or you robbed them.

23:07.300 --> 23:09.320
- Saying no don't
take much time, either.

23:11.690 --> 23:13.190
[clicks tongue]
Ya!

23:17.060 --> 23:18.330
Ho!

23:19.330 --> 23:24.770
[music]

23:52.630 --> 23:54.580
Daddy!

23:54.780 --> 23:57.280
- What are you doing
barefoot in the snow? Come here.

23:57.480 --> 23:58.580
I didn't know I needed shoes

23:58.780 --> 24:00.150
'cause I didn't know
I was going outside.

24:00.350 --> 24:02.720
- Well, you're outside now.
- 'Cause I heard you outside.

24:02.920 --> 24:05.560
- How 'bout we go inside
and we solve this problem?

24:05.760 --> 24:07.480
Hello, anybody home?

24:08.710 --> 24:10.500
- Montana State's building
a radio station.

24:10.700 --> 24:12.260
- A radio station?
- Mm-hmm.

24:12.460 --> 24:13.630
I don't know what they're gonna
do with it when it's built,

24:13.830 --> 24:15.570
but they're building it.

24:15.770 --> 24:18.570
- You can hear the news instead
of reading it, I guess.

24:18.770 --> 24:20.000
I don't care to read it

24:20.200 --> 24:21.870
and I sure don't need someone
to read it to me.

24:22.070 --> 24:24.070
- They could play music
through it.

24:24.280 --> 24:25.780
Music would be nice.

24:25.980 --> 24:27.080
What's a radio?

24:27.280 --> 24:29.250
Well, a radio...

24:29.450 --> 24:31.530
See it's a big box that...

24:33.940 --> 24:35.420
How do I explain this?

24:35.620 --> 24:38.020
- It lets you listen to people
from other parts of the world.

24:38.220 --> 24:39.360
- Yeah.
- Like a phone?

24:39.560 --> 24:40.790
Mmm...

24:40.990 --> 24:44.160
With a phone you talk back,
with a radio you just listen.

24:44.360 --> 24:46.530
How do they work?

24:46.730 --> 24:48.080
Well...

24:50.120 --> 24:52.370
I don't have the foggiest
idea how they work.

24:52.570 --> 24:54.140
Radio waves.

24:54.340 --> 24:56.010
What's a radio wave?

24:56.210 --> 24:58.080
- Well, you're asking the wrong
side of the family

24:58.280 --> 25:01.010
the hard questions, son.
Go ahead and ask your mother.

25:01.210 --> 25:02.330
[chuckles]

25:04.570 --> 25:07.500
[music]

25:30.660 --> 25:31.730
Mama?

25:33.760 --> 25:34.880
Why are you out of bed?

25:35.080 --> 25:36.110
Can't sleep.

25:36.310 --> 25:37.850
Why can't you sleep?

25:38.050 --> 25:39.520
There's a monster.

25:39.720 --> 25:42.520
- Ah...
Where's the monster?

25:42.720 --> 25:44.090
Outside my window.

25:44.290 --> 25:46.090
He's gone now but
I thought you should know.

25:46.290 --> 25:47.660
Thank you.

25:47.860 --> 25:49.440
Daddy's not in your room.

25:50.680 --> 25:52.460
- He's in the shower
with me, baby.

25:52.660 --> 25:54.570
- Why's he in the
shower with you?

25:54.770 --> 25:55.970
We're saving water.

25:56.170 --> 25:57.080
Oh.

25:58.050 --> 25:59.090
Go back to bed.

26:03.090 --> 26:04.230
[laughing]

26:06.930 --> 26:09.400
[music]

26:54.580 --> 26:58.780
[music]

27:19.500 --> 27:21.790
[sighs]

27:21.990 --> 27:23.290
It's worse in here.

27:23.490 --> 27:24.290
We need to go you
up on the deck

27:24.490 --> 27:25.190
and get your eyes
on the horizon.

27:25.390 --> 27:26.620
[groans]

27:26.830 --> 27:28.860
Of all the ships,
they have to choose this one.

27:29.060 --> 27:30.130
After what we've been through,

27:30.330 --> 27:32.630
running into your ex is
the least of your concerns.

27:32.830 --> 27:35.100
- Let's go.
- Okay.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.220
Come on.

27:44.230 --> 27:45.940
- He can turn into it now,
it'll smooth out.

27:46.140 --> 27:48.260
- North Atlantic
wasn't this rough.

27:49.530 --> 27:50.920
It's just a swell.

27:51.120 --> 27:53.070
It'll be over soon.

27:56.170 --> 27:57.860
See?

27:58.060 --> 27:59.090
Thank the Heavens.

27:59.290 --> 28:00.880
Jennifer: Alexandra.

28:05.450 --> 28:09.100
You're mad, absolutely mad.

28:09.300 --> 28:12.270
Completely understandable,
but mad nonetheless.

28:12.470 --> 28:13.870
How angry are my parents?

28:14.070 --> 28:15.170
- Angry enough
to leave that day.

28:15.370 --> 28:17.610
- For London?
- And all your bridesmaids.

28:17.810 --> 28:19.210
All but one.

28:19.410 --> 28:20.780
- I didn't see how me
missing safari

28:20.980 --> 28:22.510
would help
Arthur's broken heart.

28:22.710 --> 28:25.100
- His heart isn't broken,
only his pride.

28:26.600 --> 28:28.490
I'd say all of him is broken.

28:28.690 --> 28:29.950
Didn't leave camp once.

28:30.150 --> 28:31.840
Barely left his tent.

28:33.310 --> 28:35.210
May we have a
moment alone, sir?

28:39.510 --> 28:42.470
The boy is destroyed.
His family is furious.

28:42.670 --> 28:44.690
I don't love him.

28:50.190 --> 28:51.680
That's love.

28:51.880 --> 28:53.910
That's lust.

28:54.110 --> 28:56.550
He's a hunter, Alexandra.

28:56.750 --> 28:58.250
And when the chase is done,

28:58.450 --> 28:59.630
he will find something
else to hunt.

29:01.640 --> 29:03.420
The chase is done.

29:03.620 --> 29:05.490
Oh, Alexandra...

29:05.690 --> 29:08.690
You must think of your family
and their standing.

29:08.890 --> 29:12.700
- The only family I'm thinking
of is the one I'm starting.

29:12.900 --> 29:15.470
- All of London will turn
its back to you, Alexandra.

29:15.670 --> 29:17.280
They won't get the chance.

29:19.850 --> 29:20.990
Anything else?

29:23.390 --> 29:26.310
- I hold no judgment,
Alexandra.

29:26.510 --> 29:28.530
My only wish for you
is happiness.

29:31.530 --> 29:32.930
Your wish came true.

29:37.500 --> 29:38.640
Then I'm happy for you.

29:39.910 --> 29:41.180
Me too.

29:54.890 --> 29:56.670
- Tonight we dine
in the grand hall.

29:56.870 --> 29:58.540
You sure?

29:58.740 --> 29:59.980
That's asking for it.

30:00.180 --> 30:02.160
I'm done hiding.

30:04.030 --> 30:04.980
You need a suit.

30:05.180 --> 30:07.450
- I ain't wasting
money on a suit.

30:07.650 --> 30:09.350
- This liner is in
the British fleet.

30:09.550 --> 30:11.310
We don't need money.
We have credit.

30:16.580 --> 30:17.910
The things you do for love.

30:20.680 --> 30:22.220
I need some help with this.

30:23.480 --> 30:27.390
[music]

30:46.410 --> 30:48.440
- I need some help.
- Mm-hmm.

30:53.810 --> 30:56.700
If you think about it,
we never had a reception.

30:56.900 --> 30:58.000
Sure, we did.

30:58.200 --> 31:00.670
- That wasn't a reception,
that was a consummation.

31:00.870 --> 31:04.240
One could argue we've
consummated enough

31:04.440 --> 31:07.180
that the English-speaking world
is now relieved of the burden.

31:07.380 --> 31:09.050
That a fact?

31:09.250 --> 31:10.660
It is.

31:12.370 --> 31:15.620
Though...

31:15.820 --> 31:20.960
To be safe, we should probably
consummate again after dinner.

31:21.160 --> 31:24.490
- Or we could just
skip dinner altogether.

31:24.700 --> 31:26.860
Approve of the dress, I see.

31:27.070 --> 31:28.630
- It's going to look great
draped over that chair.

31:28.830 --> 31:31.020
[chuckles]

31:42.960 --> 31:45.500
Most people long their
whole lives for this.

31:48.700 --> 31:50.140
And never feel it.

31:52.740 --> 31:53.870
No.

31:55.980 --> 31:57.440
What a tragedy.

32:04.150 --> 32:06.820
[chamber music playing]

32:15.930 --> 32:18.230
[indistinct chatter]

32:46.860 --> 32:49.350
- The audacity
to bring him here.

32:49.550 --> 32:51.650
She is entitled to dine, son.

32:51.850 --> 32:54.180
- That is not dining.
That is parading.

32:54.390 --> 32:57.040
That is celebrating
at my expense.

33:05.080 --> 33:07.200
- You've just avoided
marrying a woman

33:07.400 --> 33:09.170
who obviously
does not love you.

33:09.370 --> 33:11.790
I'd say that's cause
for celebration as well. Hm?

33:13.350 --> 33:15.720
[applause]

33:20.290 --> 33:22.050
We could dance.

33:22.250 --> 33:23.450
Would you care to dance?

33:23.650 --> 33:25.170
I would not.

33:28.540 --> 33:30.620
The girl is lost, son.

33:30.820 --> 33:33.170
Don't lose your
dignity with her. Hm?

33:43.020 --> 33:44.020
I'd be honored.

33:52.760 --> 33:54.010
You waltz?

33:54.210 --> 33:57.050
- My aunt was determined for us
to have a little bit of culture.

33:57.250 --> 33:59.250
Taught us in the living room.

33:59.450 --> 34:02.190
Didn't think it would ever come
in handy, but here we are.

34:02.390 --> 34:04.020
- I'm sure you danced your
share of star-struck maidens

34:04.220 --> 34:06.420
in the ballroom
at the Norfolk.

34:06.620 --> 34:08.780
I'm suddenly wild with jealousy.

34:10.180 --> 34:11.750
Wild with it, huh?

34:12.580 --> 34:15.370
- Mad.
Livid, actually.

34:15.570 --> 34:17.270
You're a cad.

34:17.470 --> 34:18.700
A libertine is
what you are, sir.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.490
- I don't know
what that means.

34:22.090 --> 34:24.160
- Well, I can assure you
it's quite the insult.

34:28.460 --> 34:29.750
Mind yourself, sir.

34:29.950 --> 34:31.180
It means watch
where you're going.

34:31.380 --> 34:32.580
It's my fault, apologies.

34:32.780 --> 34:34.000
It is certainly your fault.

34:38.570 --> 34:40.540
- You will not turn
your back to me, sir.

34:48.180 --> 34:50.900
- You've got about thirty
seconds of this bullshittin' me.

34:51.100 --> 34:53.450
Then I'm gonna mop
the fucking floor with you.

34:57.920 --> 34:59.180
We should go.

34:59.380 --> 35:01.210
- I will not allow him to shape
the course of our evening.

35:01.410 --> 35:02.880
- What happened to hiding
in our room for three weeks?

35:03.080 --> 35:04.710
That was the girl in me.

35:04.920 --> 35:06.130
This is the woman.

35:07.500 --> 35:08.520
- Oh... I'm dealing
with the woman now.

35:08.720 --> 35:10.100
You certainly are.

35:24.450 --> 35:28.640
* Now I got
the crazy blues *

35:28.840 --> 35:32.760
* Since my baby went away

35:33.990 --> 35:37.550
* I ain't got no time to lose

35:37.750 --> 35:42.490
* I must find him today

35:42.690 --> 35:47.890
* Now the doctor's gonna
do all that he can *

35:48.090 --> 35:49.530
* But what you're gonna
need is *

35:49.730 --> 35:52.460
* An undertaker man

35:52.660 --> 35:56.770
* I ain't got nothing
but bad news *

35:56.970 --> 36:00.570
* Now I got the crazy blues

36:00.770 --> 36:03.310
* Now I can read his letters

36:03.510 --> 36:07.190
* I just can't read his mind

36:10.600 --> 36:12.750
* I thought he's loving me

36:12.950 --> 36:16.220
* He's leavin' all the time

36:16.420 --> 36:17.570
Arthur?

36:18.970 --> 36:19.890
Arthur!

36:20.090 --> 36:22.590
- I challenge you--

36:22.790 --> 36:24.560
Arthur, enough.

36:24.760 --> 36:25.960
This is not the place for it!

36:26.160 --> 36:27.230
You have no wits about you?

36:27.430 --> 36:29.330
He knew of my engagement.

36:29.530 --> 36:31.170
He has defiled my honor.

36:31.370 --> 36:33.970
You are challenged, sir.

36:34.170 --> 36:36.870
Choose your weapon.

36:37.070 --> 36:38.580
This your son?

36:38.780 --> 36:39.540
He is.

36:39.740 --> 36:41.900
I kill for a living.

36:43.260 --> 36:44.510
You do not want
him to fight me.

36:44.720 --> 36:45.720
No, I do not.

36:45.920 --> 36:46.930
Then control him.

36:52.110 --> 36:53.190
Arthur!

36:53.390 --> 36:55.430
- You defile my honor
and then you abandon yours?

36:55.630 --> 36:57.660
You are no gentleman, sir.

36:57.860 --> 37:00.300
You are no gentleman!

37:00.500 --> 37:03.230
Go, go run away
with your whore.

37:03.430 --> 37:06.390
Run away with
your fucking whore!

37:09.860 --> 37:10.860
Please don't...

37:19.730 --> 37:21.540
[grunts, coughs]

37:23.700 --> 37:24.710
Challenge accepted.

37:28.410 --> 37:30.130
Choose your weapon.

37:30.330 --> 37:31.380
You choose.

37:33.350 --> 37:35.330
I couldn't care less.

37:35.530 --> 37:36.850
To the deck.

37:40.450 --> 37:42.140
- Arthur.
Arthur, no.

37:42.340 --> 37:43.260
Arthur!

37:47.490 --> 37:51.000
- Now, what a lovely mess
you've made of my family.

37:52.600 --> 37:55.740
And what an embarrassment
you've become to yours.

38:07.680 --> 38:09.050
[pounding]

38:10.720 --> 38:11.800
There's a duel on the bow.

38:12.000 --> 38:13.240
Between who?

38:13.440 --> 38:17.410
- Some American and...
the Earl of Sussex.

38:17.610 --> 38:19.360
Notify the first mate.

38:31.840 --> 38:33.520
- Have you experience
with a sword?

38:33.720 --> 38:34.990
Never held one.

38:35.190 --> 38:36.490
Arthur is an expert swordsman.

38:36.690 --> 38:39.650
Spencer, his words
mean nothing.

38:40.910 --> 38:43.030
There is no dishonor
in refusing to fight.

38:43.230 --> 38:44.400
- If he's doing this shit
on day one.

38:44.600 --> 38:46.920
How do you think he's
going to be on day fifteen?

38:48.390 --> 38:49.790
Might as well get it over with.

39:15.220 --> 39:16.100
Spencer!

39:16.300 --> 39:17.480
[grunts]

39:26.930 --> 39:28.460
[grunting]

39:48.820 --> 39:50.600
Enough, son!

39:50.800 --> 39:52.790
I did not yield.

39:54.390 --> 39:55.970
I do not yield to you!

39:56.170 --> 39:57.940
I do not yield,
you Yankee scum.

39:58.140 --> 40:01.650
- Arthur!
- [shrieking]

40:01.850 --> 40:03.180
- Arthur!
- Man overboard!

40:03.380 --> 40:05.350
- Arthur!
- Come about!

40:05.550 --> 40:07.430
Arthur! Arthur!

40:09.800 --> 40:11.820
Take this man to the brig.

40:12.020 --> 40:15.220
- To duel is illegal, sir.
- I didn't choose it.

40:15.430 --> 40:16.860
Alex: Arthur pulled a pistol.

40:17.060 --> 40:19.060
They saw.
They all saw.

40:19.260 --> 40:20.580
Who will speak on his behalf?

40:30.590 --> 40:31.630
To the brig with you, sir.

40:32.890 --> 40:35.010
Sailor: Let's go.
Spencer: No.

40:35.210 --> 40:36.500
Alex: No, no...
Spencer: No!

40:39.130 --> 40:41.180
- My husband threw
down his sword.

40:41.380 --> 40:45.050
Arthur pulled a pistol
on an unarmed man.

40:45.260 --> 40:46.090
Says you.

40:46.290 --> 40:47.920
Yes, says me.

40:48.130 --> 40:49.890
On my honor, I say it.

40:50.090 --> 40:52.160
Honor?

40:52.360 --> 40:54.730
You dare to speak that
word in front of me?

40:54.930 --> 40:56.500
What honor do you have...

40:56.700 --> 40:59.670
Where is the honor
in your actions?

40:59.870 --> 41:02.710
- Captain, I demand
this woman be remanded

41:02.910 --> 41:06.140
to her quarters until the ship
reaches port in London.

41:06.340 --> 41:09.150
[Alex panting]

41:09.350 --> 41:11.920
- You say you are my
friend, prove it now.

41:12.120 --> 41:13.880
Tell them the truth.

41:14.080 --> 41:15.940
[whispering]
Tell them what you saw.

41:16.700 --> 41:18.300
Please, please...

41:21.980 --> 41:23.480
She speaks the truth.

41:25.350 --> 41:28.570
Arthur refused to yield even
after Spencer had withdrawn.

41:28.770 --> 41:30.670
- Stop speaking,
I will not hear it!

41:30.870 --> 41:33.170
Remand her to her
quarters, sir.

41:33.370 --> 41:34.990
Or do you forget my title?

41:36.860 --> 41:38.690
Take the lady to her quarters.

41:46.570 --> 41:48.200
[music]

42:10.520 --> 42:12.340
You okay?

42:12.540 --> 42:13.730
Belly hurts.

42:15.100 --> 42:16.980
Can I get you something?

42:17.180 --> 42:18.900
Soda water maybe.

42:26.640 --> 42:27.940
[groans]

42:30.110 --> 42:31.810
[music]

42:47.290 --> 42:48.510
She feeling better?

42:48.710 --> 42:50.510
Asked for some soda water.

42:50.710 --> 42:52.550
No, no, that won't help.

42:52.750 --> 42:54.270
Peppermint tea. Yes.

42:59.570 --> 43:00.610
Elizabeth: Jack!

43:09.380 --> 43:11.450
[music]

43:23.160 --> 43:25.530
- She's stable now.
The bleeding has stopped.

43:27.300 --> 43:29.040
She flushed the baby though.

43:30.040 --> 43:31.240
I'm sorry.

43:32.840 --> 43:34.170
I'll check on her
in the evening.

43:51.290 --> 43:52.960
How you feeling?

43:55.530 --> 43:57.130
Like a failure.

44:11.710 --> 44:16.270
- It's just nature
looking out for you.

44:16.470 --> 44:18.650
Things weren't right
and nature took care of it.

44:20.620 --> 44:21.940
It happens to horses.

44:22.140 --> 44:23.260
It happens to cattle.

44:27.790 --> 44:29.830
- It happens to cattle,
you sell them.

44:31.160 --> 44:32.450
Well, you ain't getting sold,

44:32.650 --> 44:34.430
if that's what
you're worried about.

44:36.000 --> 44:38.370
- It's my one purpose
on this planet.

44:43.080 --> 44:45.980
If I can't do it, then what
the hell am I here for?

44:56.990 --> 44:58.830
- Well, my aunt
never had children.

45:01.160 --> 45:03.460
You saying she got no purpose?

45:07.870 --> 45:09.140
She raised me.

45:10.800 --> 45:12.920
Raised my father.

45:13.120 --> 45:15.710
Nursed my uncle back to life.

45:16.510 --> 45:17.510
You, too.

45:19.750 --> 45:21.260
No telling how many lives

45:21.460 --> 45:22.880
she nursed away from
death during the war.

45:24.750 --> 45:27.220
I look at my aunt
and all I see is purpose.

45:29.160 --> 45:30.790
Maybe that's
your purpose, too.

45:35.530 --> 45:37.500
Be a mother to those
who ain't got one.

45:39.930 --> 45:42.320
A teacher to those
who need lessons.

45:42.520 --> 45:44.070
We choose our purpose.

45:46.170 --> 45:50.660
The word you're looking
for is destiny.

45:50.860 --> 45:52.560
And if you wanna give God
a good laugh,

45:52.760 --> 45:55.260
tell him what you
think your destiny is.

45:55.470 --> 45:57.580
- And if I can't
ever have children?

46:00.520 --> 46:02.160
- Then you can't
have children.

46:03.820 --> 46:06.030
- Then you'll
never be a father.

46:08.590 --> 46:10.300
I guess it ain't my destiny.

46:11.800 --> 46:13.520
You're my destiny.

46:13.720 --> 46:16.200
- You just said you
can't choose destiny.

46:18.840 --> 46:20.140
You chose me.

46:22.540 --> 46:25.010
- One look at you
and I had no choice at all.

46:27.050 --> 46:28.510
Destiny...

46:32.120 --> 46:34.170
And think of all the things
God had to give you

46:34.370 --> 46:36.240
to make you choose me.

46:36.440 --> 46:41.430
Like poor judgment, bad vision,
terrible taste in men.

46:43.200 --> 46:44.930
[music]

46:51.870 --> 46:53.840
We take what life gives us.

46:56.410 --> 46:58.110
It's all we can do.

47:02.520 --> 47:08.450
[music]

47:27.240 --> 47:28.470
[pounding]

47:34.250 --> 47:35.200
Can I help you?

47:35.400 --> 47:36.370
Alice Chow?

47:36.570 --> 47:37.400
That's right.

47:37.600 --> 47:38.570
- You're under arrest
for violating

47:38.770 --> 47:40.200
the Montana statute
against miscegenation.

47:40.400 --> 47:41.400
Against what?

47:41.600 --> 47:43.670
- Don't play dumb.
You married a white man.

47:43.870 --> 47:45.330
And these are
his mongrel kids.

47:47.290 --> 47:49.010
Hey!

47:49.210 --> 47:50.010
Alice: No, no!

47:50.210 --> 47:51.380
No!

47:51.580 --> 47:52.450
[children screaming]

47:52.650 --> 47:53.570
Daddy!

47:55.040 --> 47:57.220
Alice: No!

47:57.420 --> 47:58.340
[sobbing]

48:03.510 --> 48:06.630
- I ought to arrest you
for assaulting a peace officer,

48:06.830 --> 48:09.250
but I don't want those filthy
fucking kids in my squad car.

48:15.760 --> 48:16.870
Daddy?

48:17.070 --> 48:18.820
Help him!

48:21.190 --> 48:22.730
No, no, no!

48:24.430 --> 48:29.200
[music]

48:58.300 --> 48:59.380
Whatcha got there?

48:59.580 --> 49:01.100
Where?

49:03.100 --> 49:04.900
There, beside ya.

49:07.040 --> 49:08.560
[sighs]

49:08.760 --> 49:10.960
It's a towel.

49:11.160 --> 49:12.080
Ah...

49:13.880 --> 49:15.760
Whatcha doing with it?

49:15.970 --> 49:16.980
Nothin'.

49:19.990 --> 49:22.440
- I've noticed a pattern
in our fifty years together.

49:22.640 --> 49:24.070
When you hide something from me,

49:24.270 --> 49:26.160
it's because you
fear the thing.

49:27.290 --> 49:28.810
So what's got you scared now?

49:29.010 --> 49:31.750
I can't feel my fingers.

49:31.950 --> 49:33.620
I'm squeezing the
towel thinking maybe

49:33.820 --> 49:36.700
it'll make 'em stronger
and get some feeling back.

49:40.440 --> 49:42.580
You're lucky I love you so much.

49:43.840 --> 49:46.230
If I didn't I'd ride
into those mountains

49:46.430 --> 49:47.860
with a bottle of whiskey,

49:48.060 --> 49:50.450
and I'd sit under a tree
and I would not come down.

49:51.580 --> 49:55.670
That's how much
I hate getting old

49:55.870 --> 49:57.590
and watching my body betray me.

50:04.030 --> 50:05.700
[car approaching]

50:15.380 --> 50:16.730
It's the miner.

50:16.930 --> 50:17.730
Miner?

50:17.930 --> 50:19.410
- Who bought
the Strafford Ranch.

50:31.120 --> 50:32.290
Get up here on the porch.

50:34.130 --> 50:37.150
- You're going to let that
man up on our porch?

50:37.350 --> 50:38.610
- I'd prefer to
shoot down on him,

50:38.820 --> 50:41.650
and I prefer you not to be in
the way when I do it.

50:41.850 --> 50:42.650
[car door shuts]

50:42.850 --> 50:45.220
What a structure.

50:45.420 --> 50:48.620
Inspired by the lodge
in the park, I presume.

50:48.830 --> 50:50.190
Other way around.

50:50.390 --> 50:52.160
Is that a fact?

50:52.360 --> 50:53.400
Same builder?

50:53.600 --> 50:54.810
Don't know.

50:58.720 --> 50:59.940
Put 'em down!

51:00.140 --> 51:01.440
[clamoring]

51:01.640 --> 51:02.910
Put down your weapons!

51:03.110 --> 51:04.710
Hey!

51:04.910 --> 51:07.540
Put 'em down!
[Whitfield laughing]

51:07.740 --> 51:09.600
You will stop!

51:11.130 --> 51:12.220
Jake: Cara!

51:12.420 --> 51:14.750
- There will be no
violence here, sir.

51:14.950 --> 51:17.090
This is our home!
Our home!

51:17.290 --> 51:20.190
Have you no
decency whatsoever?

51:20.390 --> 51:21.590
- Well, I suppose that would
depend on what

51:21.790 --> 51:22.910
you consider decent.

51:25.150 --> 51:27.560
Well, we've shown all
our toys, Stuart.

51:27.760 --> 51:29.650
We can put them away now.

51:31.480 --> 51:35.040
I trust you will offer
us the same courtesy.

51:35.240 --> 51:36.260
Lower 'em, boys.

51:39.360 --> 51:41.180
- Your line of work appears
to focus your attention

51:41.380 --> 51:42.350
on the season.

51:42.550 --> 51:44.810
Calving in the spring,
branding in the summer,

51:45.010 --> 51:46.850
selling in the fall, and then...

51:47.050 --> 51:48.920
Surviving the winter.

51:49.120 --> 51:51.190
The future receives
all my focus.

51:51.390 --> 51:53.790
Once a mine is producing,
I think no more of it...

51:53.990 --> 51:55.590
I seek the next.

51:55.790 --> 51:59.660
Back east, every home
has electricity.

51:59.860 --> 52:01.700
and running water.

52:01.900 --> 52:05.330
One in ten Americans
owns an automobile.

52:05.540 --> 52:08.940
By the end of the decade
it will be one in four.

52:09.140 --> 52:13.110
The world will be mobile.

52:13.310 --> 52:15.840
You know, they expect
130,000 visitors

52:16.050 --> 52:18.710
in the park this year.
Can you imagine?

52:18.920 --> 52:20.350
In thirty years cattle
will not be

52:20.550 --> 52:22.050
the largest industry
in Montana.

52:22.250 --> 52:23.920
Neither will mining.

52:24.120 --> 52:25.720
Can you guess
what it will be?

52:25.920 --> 52:27.320
I don't care what it will be.

52:27.520 --> 52:31.460
- You should. It will have a
profound affect on your family.

52:31.660 --> 52:33.130
Tourism.

52:33.330 --> 52:35.930
More Americans live in cities
than the country

52:36.130 --> 52:38.800
for the first time
in this nation's existence.

52:39.000 --> 52:40.970
And they will come by
the millions to experience

52:41.170 --> 52:45.370
this majestic place,
and they won't want to leave.

52:45.580 --> 52:49.310
Texas has its oil boom.
Our boom will be land.

52:49.510 --> 52:50.780
And as the two
largest landowners

52:50.980 --> 52:54.320
in the state, we stand
to benefit handsomely.

52:54.520 --> 52:57.590
I was looking over
the public records.

52:57.790 --> 53:01.290
You're one of very few ranches
who owns his land with no loan.

53:01.490 --> 53:03.690
Impressive, especially
with the collapse

53:03.890 --> 53:06.130
of the market since
the war ended.

53:06.330 --> 53:08.660
I commend you, sir.

53:08.870 --> 53:11.700
You were, however, behind
on your property taxes.

53:11.900 --> 53:12.800
Were you aware?

53:13.000 --> 53:15.200
- The end of the year
is not here yet.

53:15.410 --> 53:17.310
- The payments are biannual,
as you know.

53:17.510 --> 53:20.240
- That's not a requirement,
that's an option.

53:20.440 --> 53:22.040
We argue semantics.

53:22.240 --> 53:24.250
And not much of an option
for a rancher

53:24.450 --> 53:26.780
who only gets paid
in the fall.

53:26.980 --> 53:34.220
The point is, that first
payment has not been made, so...

53:34.420 --> 53:36.380
I took the liberty
of making it for you.

53:40.110 --> 53:41.910
Hefty penny you owed.

53:45.950 --> 53:48.070
As I'm sure you're aware,

53:48.270 --> 53:51.840
if I'm not repaid
by the end of the year,

53:52.040 --> 53:53.890
the deed reverts to me.

53:55.090 --> 53:56.660
We have done no harm to you.

53:57.930 --> 53:59.980
Why would you do this to us?

54:00.180 --> 54:03.650
- Because I can.
I'm a businessman.

54:03.850 --> 54:06.670
The word "decent"
doesn't apply to me.

54:11.780 --> 54:13.250
He can do this?

54:15.550 --> 54:17.220
Can he do this, Jacob?

54:20.350 --> 54:22.190
[car engine starts]

54:41.610 --> 54:43.940
[music]

55:12.770 --> 55:14.390
This way.

55:14.590 --> 55:17.530
- We must bury him.
Give Last Rites.

55:17.730 --> 55:19.400
He was a child of God.

55:19.600 --> 55:21.530
- If he's a child of God and
there's such thing as Heaven,

55:21.730 --> 55:23.550
then I'm sure God
already let him in.

55:26.390 --> 55:27.800
But if you're saying it
takes your prayers

55:28.000 --> 55:30.760
and us digging a hole then
there ain't no fucking Heaven.

55:32.060 --> 55:33.730
[music]

55:52.850 --> 55:55.420
[sheep bleating]

56:11.460 --> 56:14.080
You sure it's your girl?

56:14.280 --> 56:15.470
I'm sure.

56:19.740 --> 56:21.090
Only one of 'em?

56:21.290 --> 56:22.530
Ain't just one anymore.

56:22.730 --> 56:24.760
There's three sets of tracks
heading out the canyon.

56:24.960 --> 56:27.480
Won't be any tracks
out on the plains, though.

56:29.380 --> 56:31.530
Where would they go?

56:31.730 --> 56:33.770
Can't go back to the rez.
Can't go to town.

56:33.970 --> 56:34.640
Where would they go?

56:34.840 --> 56:37.040
Canada.

56:37.240 --> 56:38.570
One would think.

56:38.780 --> 56:40.060
It's a day's ride.

56:41.190 --> 56:42.850
But your girl...
She thinks like a coyote.

56:43.050 --> 56:44.560
She does the opposite
of what makes sense.

56:46.670 --> 56:47.650
What would you do?

56:47.850 --> 56:49.990
Don't know.

56:50.190 --> 56:51.570
Tough it out
in the mountains maybe.

56:52.640 --> 56:54.860
Can't tough out winter.

56:55.060 --> 56:57.210
No, they're gonna go somewhere
they can fit in.

56:59.010 --> 57:01.600
Another reservation,
somewhere south with no law.

57:01.800 --> 57:03.670
- That Comanche reservation
is about as wild

57:03.870 --> 57:05.870
- as anything there is.
- Yep.

57:06.070 --> 57:08.170
- That's gonna be
a hell of a ride.

57:08.370 --> 57:10.610
Well, we ain't gonna ride it.

57:10.810 --> 57:12.940
We're gonna take the train.

57:13.140 --> 57:14.290
When they get there,
we'll be waiting.

57:16.130 --> 57:18.100
[music]

57:25.400 --> 57:27.640
[music]

57:34.450 --> 57:35.450
[horse snorting]

57:42.990 --> 57:44.090
[speaking Crow]

58:04.780 --> 58:07.030
[clicks tongue]

58:07.230 --> 58:10.950
[music]

58:24.460 --> 58:26.070
[music]

58:47.850 --> 58:49.050
Where's the man's things?

58:51.260 --> 58:52.860
The man needs his things.

59:12.380 --> 59:13.780
Wait.

59:17.850 --> 59:19.430
[door locks]

59:19.640 --> 59:21.340
What are you doing?

59:21.540 --> 59:23.820
Where are you taking him?

59:33.070 --> 59:34.330
Let's go.

59:38.200 --> 59:39.290
Where?

59:39.490 --> 59:41.860
- Captain's quarters.
Turn around.

59:42.060 --> 59:44.080
[music]

59:45.880 --> 59:46.980
[handcuffs clasping]

1:00:20.980 --> 1:00:24.570
- It seems your claim
of self defense has merit.

1:00:24.770 --> 1:00:27.240
I didn't want to fight him.

1:00:27.440 --> 1:00:28.450
I damn sure didn't
want to kill him.

1:00:30.790 --> 1:00:32.110
He gave me no other choice.

1:00:32.310 --> 1:00:33.810
That's been made clear.

1:00:34.010 --> 1:00:36.110
I'll not notify authorities
at your port of call

1:00:36.310 --> 1:00:39.180
but this ship sails
under a British flag.

1:00:39.380 --> 1:00:41.420
And the Prince in
succession has ordered you

1:00:41.620 --> 1:00:42.920
removed from the vessel.

1:00:43.120 --> 1:00:45.390
That's fine by me.

1:00:45.590 --> 1:00:47.460
We will dinghy you to port.

1:00:47.660 --> 1:00:49.390
I need my wife.

1:00:49.590 --> 1:00:50.540
Your wife?

1:00:51.780 --> 1:00:53.150
You mean the
Countess of Sussex?

1:00:55.250 --> 1:00:57.200
Yes, that's who you mean.

1:00:57.400 --> 1:00:58.930
- Do you have any proof
of this marriage?

1:00:59.140 --> 1:01:01.540
- I have a ring
and I have my word.

1:01:01.740 --> 1:01:03.810
- The Earl of Sussex
has called into question

1:01:04.010 --> 1:01:06.240
the legality of the marriage.

1:01:06.440 --> 1:01:08.880
- We were married on a ship
in international waters.

1:01:09.080 --> 1:01:10.330
By the ship's Captain.

1:01:13.170 --> 1:01:15.820
Do you question your authority
to oversee marriages?

1:01:16.020 --> 1:01:17.320
I do not.

1:01:17.520 --> 1:01:20.220
But the limits
of my authority are met

1:01:20.420 --> 1:01:22.260
when a member of the
Royal family commands me

1:01:22.460 --> 1:01:24.830
to remove a passenger
from one of the King's ships

1:01:25.030 --> 1:01:26.700
and detain another.

1:01:26.900 --> 1:01:28.900
I suggest you send
for her in London.

1:01:29.100 --> 1:01:31.400
I'm not leaving without her.

1:01:31.600 --> 1:01:33.390
- It's not your
decision to make.

1:01:38.090 --> 1:01:40.530
- If you'll excuse me.
- Of course.

1:01:41.530 --> 1:01:43.600
[music]

1:01:52.640 --> 1:01:53.860
Alexandra.

1:01:54.060 --> 1:01:55.260
[knocking]

1:01:55.460 --> 1:01:57.430
- Alexandra.
- Jennifer?

1:01:57.630 --> 1:01:59.730
- I've convinced them to pursue
no charges against him.

1:01:59.930 --> 1:02:00.960
But they are removing
him from the ship.

1:02:01.160 --> 1:02:02.850
- When?
- Now.

1:02:10.520 --> 1:02:11.820
You must get me out of here.

1:02:16.160 --> 1:02:17.430
- A porter's coming.
Hide yourself.

1:02:18.630 --> 1:02:20.650
- Sir, my husband
locked the door.

1:02:20.850 --> 1:02:22.180
Do you have a pass key?

1:02:22.380 --> 1:02:23.840
But of course, miss.

1:02:28.010 --> 1:02:30.080
- For your troubles, sir.
- Many thanks, miss.

1:02:42.120 --> 1:02:43.840
The Earl said you must remain.

1:02:44.040 --> 1:02:46.270
He questions the validity
of your marriage.

1:02:46.480 --> 1:02:48.510
- He can't keep me on
this ship if I want off.

1:02:48.710 --> 1:02:50.330
- He can.
And he did.

1:02:52.500 --> 1:02:54.350
We'll see about that at port.

1:02:54.550 --> 1:02:55.770
We aren't going to port.

1:02:58.200 --> 1:02:59.420
They're taking him by dinghy.

1:02:59.620 --> 1:03:00.970
Oh...

1:03:02.540 --> 1:03:05.110
[music]

1:03:55.590 --> 1:03:56.660
Spencer!

1:03:57.660 --> 1:03:58.700
Spencer!

1:03:59.260 --> 1:04:01.050
Alex...Alex!

1:04:01.250 --> 1:04:03.190
I will come to you!

1:04:03.390 --> 1:04:04.950
Where do I go?

1:04:05.150 --> 1:04:06.350
- You have to take me back.
That's my wife.

1:04:06.560 --> 1:04:09.420
You have no right!
You have no right!

1:04:09.630 --> 1:04:12.210
- [crying]
- Where do I go?
- I love you, Alex!

1:04:14.610 --> 1:04:16.970
- Why did you do this to me?
- [grunts]

1:04:17.170 --> 1:04:18.770
Why? Why?

1:04:18.970 --> 1:04:23.070
[Alex sobbing]

1:04:23.270 --> 1:04:24.560
No!

1:04:26.190 --> 1:04:27.330
No!

1:04:30.760 --> 1:04:31.800
Stay there!

1:04:40.640 --> 1:04:41.810
Bozeman!

1:04:44.110 --> 1:04:47.310
I will meet you
in Bozeman, Montana!

1:04:48.510 --> 1:04:51.600
- I love you!
- I love you, Alex!

1:04:51.800 --> 1:04:53.820
- [distant]
- I love you!

1:05:08.400 --> 1:05:10.540
- You may question
the marriage, sir.

1:05:12.800 --> 1:05:15.370
But difficult to
question their sincerity.

1:05:17.940 --> 1:05:20.210
[music]

1:05:31.960 --> 1:05:34.380
Cara: <i>Spencer.</i>

1:05:34.580 --> 1:05:36.740
<i>I fear everything your</i>
<i>parents fought so hard</i>

1:05:36.950 --> 1:05:39.950

1:05:40.150 --> 1:05:42.430
<i>You are its only hope.</i>

1:05:44.240 --> 1:05:48.490
<i>You are our only hope.</i>

1:05:48.690 --> 1:05:50.210
<i>You must hurry, Spencer.</i>

1:05:51.410 --> 1:05:52.610
<i>You must hurry.</i>

1:05:54.680 --> 1:05:58.800
<i>Or there will be nothing</i>
<i>left to fight for.</i>

1:05:59.000 --> 1:06:00.890
[music]
