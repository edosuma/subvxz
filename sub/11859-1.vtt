WEBVTT

00:30.000 --> 00:33.000
- 'Are you Warriors?'
- 'Yes, we are.'

00:33.083 --> 00:33.959
Warriors!

00:34.041 --> 00:35.125
- We are..
- Warriors!

00:35.208 --> 00:36.500
- We are..
- Warriors!

00:36.583 --> 00:38.250
- We are..
- Warriors!

00:49.709 --> 00:50.875
Let's go!

00:51.792 --> 00:53.417
Warriors!

00:55.709 --> 00:56.959
- Bring it in. Come on.
- Now!

00:57.041 --> 00:59.291
Bring it in!
What the hell did I tell
you?

01:00.834 --> 01:03.875
Pay attention. Red right, 34.
Send it in the middle..

01:03.959 --> 01:05.792
[man on speaker]
'Now, folks, the biggest game
of the season'

01:05.875 --> 01:07.125
'comes down to one play.'

01:07.208 --> 01:08.917
'Oh, boy, this is a dandy..'

01:09.000 --> 01:10.291
Red right, 34.

01:10.375 --> 01:11.959
- You ready, Moon?
- Let's go.

01:12.041 --> 01:14.458
'Down by four with 14 seconds
left, the most important..'

01:14.542 --> 01:16.041
- Let's go!
- Let's go!

01:16.125 --> 01:17.417
Let's take care
of business, huh?

01:17.500 --> 01:18.667
Alright, ready?

01:18.750 --> 01:20.583
(all)
Break!

01:20.667 --> 01:23.583
(man on speaker)
'Here we go. Buckle up,
Irene.'

01:23.667 --> 01:26.333
'The Warriors line up to try
and make one more play.'

01:26.417 --> 01:28.709
'No time-outs left.
The clock is running.'

01:30.417 --> 01:31.875
Hut! Hut! Hut!

01:52.375 --> 01:53.625
(male commentator)
'Touchdown!'

01:53.709 --> 01:55.834
'Bad Moon McShane
has done it again.'

01:55.917 --> 01:57.792
'How sweet the wine.'

01:57.875 --> 01:59.333
'That's Warrior football.'

01:59.417 --> 02:00.917
'No guts, no glory.'

02:01.000 --> 02:02.041
Took you long enough.

02:02.125 --> 02:03.667
I took the scenic route.

02:46.625 --> 02:49.417
(male commentator on TV)
'First attempt to thirty,
Perano..'

02:49.500 --> 02:51.250
'...looks for his tight
end,
he has a..'

02:51.333 --> 02:54.542
(Jeffries)
Al's Bar,
college football paradise.

02:54.625 --> 02:56.417
You played high school ball
with Al?

02:56.500 --> 02:59.834
Yeah, he was the
fastest
halfback in Philly in
1967.

02:59.917 --> 03:01.917
Ran the 40 in four three.

03:02.000 --> 03:04.417
[chuckles]
I take it that's good.

03:04.500 --> 03:06.375
The record still stands.

03:06.458 --> 03:07.583
There he is.

03:07.667 --> 03:09.417
- 'What do you say,
Lightner?'
- Hi.

03:09.500 --> 03:11.417
[chuckles]
Tombstone!

03:11.500 --> 03:13.667
[laughs]
Good to see you, man.

03:13.750 --> 03:14.625
Tombstone?

03:14.709 --> 03:16.333
The guy played linebacker.

03:16.417 --> 03:18.083
Used to bury halfbacks.

03:18.166 --> 03:19.542
Detective Rush.

03:19.625 --> 03:21.542
I like your place, Al.

03:21.625 --> 03:23.875
So what's up?
You said it was
important.

03:23.959 --> 03:26.375
You remember Bad Moon McShane?

03:26.458 --> 03:28.667
(Jeffries)
'Well, hell yeah.
Warrior football star.'

03:28.750 --> 03:31.000
Murdered the night
before the '73 championship.

03:31.083 --> 03:33.875
No one knew until he was
a no-show for the game.

03:33.959 --> 03:35.291
Check this out.

03:35.375 --> 03:38.500
I'm always searching
eBay
for Warrior stuff.

03:39.875 --> 03:41.750
Found this..

03:41.834 --> 03:43.000
...tucked inside a program.

03:43.083 --> 03:44.583
(Rush)
'A ticket sign-out sheet.'

03:44.667 --> 03:47.083
The way players got
tickets
to family and friends.

03:47.166 --> 03:49.750
Now, I-I know
you only played defense

03:49.834 --> 03:52.000
but, uh, try and keep up.

03:52.083 --> 03:53.333
'Look at the signature.'

03:55.041 --> 03:59.041
McShane signed out tickets
to R. Boreki at 9 a.m.

03:59.125 --> 04:00.583
Day of the game.

04:00.667 --> 04:02.000
But the cops said
he was murdered

04:02.083 --> 04:03.625
10 p.m. the night before.

04:03.709 --> 04:06.000
They thought he ran
into some drunk State fans.

04:06.083 --> 04:07.917
Big rivalry game.
Emotions running high.

04:08.000 --> 04:09.625
Right, except according
to this.

04:09.709 --> 04:12.166
Mike was alive on Saturday.

04:12.250 --> 04:14.458
That's an entire morning
unaccounted for.

04:14.542 --> 04:15.792
(Al)
'His mom..'

04:16.875 --> 04:18.250
She still comes in.

04:18.333 --> 04:19.834
Once a year.

04:19.917 --> 04:21.208
Look at the pictures of him.

04:22.250 --> 04:23.625
Sure would mean a lot to her.

04:25.083 --> 04:26.250
Hell, all of us.

04:28.041 --> 04:30.000
Find the person
who murdered that young man.

05:17.625 --> 05:18.959
Son of a..

05:19.792 --> 05:21.834
Ah, leaky pipes.

05:21.917 --> 05:24.041
Nothing but the best
upkeep
for the cold ones.

05:24.125 --> 05:26.083
Yeah, this will look great
in court.

05:27.792 --> 05:30.041
"Michael Bad Moon McShane.

05:30.125 --> 05:32.583
"Came to the U in
'70
on a full ride.

05:32.667 --> 05:34.834
Recruited from
Latrobe High
School."

05:34.917 --> 05:36.458
Oh, small town kid.

05:36.542 --> 05:39.375
An only child, raised
by his English teacher
mom.

05:39.458 --> 05:42.250
Sends her boy out to school.
He never comes home.

05:42.333 --> 05:43.959
'"Body's found near a dumpster'

05:44.041 --> 05:47.000
"between the players' dorm
and the stadium parking lot

05:47.083 --> 05:48.500
near section G-68."

05:48.583 --> 05:50.959
"A group of students
leaving the game found him.

05:51.041 --> 05:52.834
'"Blunt force trauma
to the head'

05:52.917 --> 05:54.166
and weapon never found."

05:54.250 --> 05:57.083
Coroner Inskeep
stated time of death

05:57.166 --> 05:58.583
was 10 p.m. Friday night.

05:58.667 --> 06:00.750
The same numbskull coroner
who mucked up every job

06:00.834 --> 06:02.458
'he touched in the 70s.'

06:02.542 --> 06:05.750
A message taped on Mike's door
Friday night.

06:05.834 --> 06:06.917
"Pez called ."

06:07.000 --> 06:09.417
Pez?
It's a drug dealer nickname?

06:09.500 --> 06:11.208
Or the nickname for R. Boreki.

06:11.291 --> 06:12.959
'The guy he signed out
the tickets to.'

06:13.041 --> 06:16.291
Mike's trading player tickets
for drugs. Deal goes down
wrong.

06:16.375 --> 06:18.792
Questioned documents looked
at the sign-out sheet.

06:18.875 --> 06:20.208
It's Mike's signature.

06:20.291 --> 06:22.458
Mmm.

06:22.542 --> 06:24.542
(Valens)
'It's proof he was there
that morning.'

06:24.625 --> 06:27.583
So the call from Pez
was a set-up to meet?

06:27.667 --> 06:29.583
Well, section G-68 was isolated.

06:29.667 --> 06:31.917
'Original report said a lot
of drug deals went down
there.'

06:32.000 --> 06:33.500
Well, fullback's a big guy.

06:33.583 --> 06:36.208
Yet no one saw him Friday night
or Saturday morning?

06:36.291 --> 06:38.709
Not his best bud,
Tom The Breeze Bernard.

06:38.792 --> 06:41.083
No one on the team,
campus.

06:41.166 --> 06:43.291
New timeline might
jog
some memory.

06:43.375 --> 06:44.834
Go visit the U?

06:44.917 --> 06:46.625
See what the team was doing
the morning Moon was killed.

06:46.709 --> 06:50.917
I'll grab some yearbooks, see
if we can find this R. Boreki.

06:51.000 --> 06:52.083
What do you say?

06:52.166 --> 06:53.375
Tombstone?

06:55.959 --> 06:58.834
I have so many photos
of Mike playing football

06:58.917 --> 07:00.458
but this is my favorite.

07:02.250 --> 07:03.500
(Stillman)
'Oh, Mike liked to read.'

07:03.583 --> 07:04.875
(Mrs. McShane)
'When he was younger, oh, yes.'

07:04.959 --> 07:06.792
'Before the sports took over.'

07:06.875 --> 07:07.959
Well, sounds like
there was a lot more

07:08.041 --> 07:09.542
to Mike than just football.

07:09.625 --> 07:12.583
Mrs. McShane, we're
looking
for a friend of his.

07:12.667 --> 07:13.709
R. Boreki.

07:13.792 --> 07:15.667
Mike ever mentioned him?

07:15.750 --> 07:16.917
I'm sorry.

07:18.500 --> 07:20.291
You know, Mike had
so many friends.

07:21.542 --> 07:23.125
That's why
I could never understand

07:23.208 --> 07:24.834
why anybody would want
to harm him.

07:27.917 --> 07:29.166
Excuse me.

07:31.583 --> 07:33.750
(Vera)
Talked to the stadium
ticket clerk.

07:33.834 --> 07:35.000
Guy never saw McShane.

07:35.083 --> 07:36.750
Well, what about R. Boreki?

07:36.834 --> 07:38.667
Nope, but I did get us
a tailgater.

07:38.750 --> 07:40.125
Guys were camped out
at the parking lot

07:40.208 --> 07:41.250
before the sun's up?

07:41.333 --> 07:42.959
Gotta have a game day permit.

07:43.041 --> 07:46.250
Oh, Rusty Jenkins.
Section G-68.

07:46.333 --> 07:49.041
Guy saw a car hightailing it
out of there around 9:30 a.m.

07:49.125 --> 07:51.750
(Saccardo)
There's no crying
allowed
in slinging rock.

07:53.667 --> 07:55.166
- Uh, hi.
- Hey.

07:55.250 --> 07:57.417
- Good to see you.
- Yeah, I mean..

07:57.500 --> 07:59.125
Right.

07:59.208 --> 08:00.625
- Well..
- Well..

08:02.959 --> 08:04.875
Speak English much?

08:04.959 --> 08:05.875
What?

08:05.959 --> 08:07.041
Right.

08:18.375 --> 08:20.208
Which way to the mud bath?

08:20.291 --> 08:22.709
Warrior football
brings in 45 mil a
year.

08:22.792 --> 08:24.083
I'm sure they got one.

08:24.166 --> 08:25.792
Gotta love amateur sports.

08:27.834 --> 08:29.250
(male #1)
'Gentlemen.'

08:32.667 --> 08:33.792
Head Coach Walters.

08:33.875 --> 08:36.917
Detectives Jeffries, Valens.

08:37.000 --> 08:38.750
Not a bad-looking
team
you got this year.

08:38.834 --> 08:40.333
Season's still young.

08:40.417 --> 08:42.667
Uh, you were an assistant
when Mike McShane played?

08:42.750 --> 08:43.750
Yes, sir.

08:43.834 --> 08:45.041
I'll tell you what.

08:45.125 --> 08:47.417
Mike was, what Warriors
football
was all about.

08:47.500 --> 08:48.792
Together We Stand?

08:48.875 --> 08:50.291
You better believe it.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.291
His death
was a hell of a shock.

08:52.375 --> 08:54.250
Took the program
years to recover.

08:54.333 --> 08:56.250
You know anyone named R. Boreki?

08:56.333 --> 08:58.083
'Maybe he went by Pez?'

08:58.166 --> 09:01.667
Sorry, I don't.
What's up, fellas?

09:01.750 --> 09:05.000
Got new information, says the
kid was alive Saturday
morning.

09:05.083 --> 09:06.875
Wondering if you saw
him
that day.

09:06.959 --> 09:09.000
I wish I could help out.

09:09.083 --> 09:10.917
All I know is
Mike never showed up

09:11.000 --> 09:13.291
for the mandatory
pre-game breakfast at 9:00.

09:13.375 --> 09:15.417
We hear Tom Bernard
works here.

09:15.500 --> 09:17.792
Breeze?
Should be out on the field.

09:17.875 --> 09:19.125
Jimmy.

09:21.375 --> 09:23.458
You get these men
whatever they need.

09:23.542 --> 09:24.875
<i>Mi casa es su casa.</i>

09:26.875 --> 09:28.291
Yeah.

09:39.542 --> 09:43.375
Say, uh, Mike was still
alive
Saturday morning?

09:43.458 --> 09:46.458
You're good
friends,
teammates.

09:46.542 --> 09:47.834
Figured you'd know
if he was mixed up

09:47.917 --> 09:49.333
in some kind
of trouble.

09:49.417 --> 09:51.500
[chuckles]
No way. No way.

09:51.583 --> 09:53.166
Mike would never do anything
to embarrass

09:53.250 --> 09:55.000
the program,
I'm telling you.

09:55.083 --> 09:57.166
Twenty hours
leading up to the game.

09:57.250 --> 09:58.500
Players must have had
their rituals.

09:58.583 --> 10:00.041
Oh, sure, you know,
some of the guys

10:00.125 --> 10:01.750
hit the bars,
blow off steam.

10:01.834 --> 10:03.000
Mike with you that night?

10:03.083 --> 10:05.166
No, but I didn't think
anything of it.

10:05.250 --> 10:07.000
Why is that?

10:07.083 --> 10:08.333
He'd read in his room.

10:08.417 --> 10:09.750
He'd try to hide it.

10:09.834 --> 10:11.792
But you didn't play
in that same game
either.

10:13.750 --> 10:15.750
Something keep you
from the field?

10:15.834 --> 10:18.125
Yeah, I blew my knee out
the week before.

10:19.125 --> 10:20.375
Never played again.

10:21.875 --> 10:25.083
Couple of names coming up.
Uh, Pez, R. Boreki.

10:25.166 --> 10:27.834
- Ever hear of 'em?
- That don't sound familiar.

10:27.917 --> 10:30.542
You think of anyone else
might have had it in for Mike?

10:30.625 --> 10:32.333
Man, Mike was a stand-up guy.

10:33.417 --> 10:34.750
Everybody loved him.

10:41.166 --> 10:42.750
Oh, hey, man.

10:44.000 --> 10:45.250
Thanks, Stace.

10:45.333 --> 10:48.000
Warrior win and cold
beer.
Life is good.

10:48.083 --> 10:50.583
Which way
to the Watergate
Hotel?

10:50.667 --> 10:52.166
Take that stupid thing off.

10:53.500 --> 10:55.542
Selling these everywhere.

10:55.625 --> 10:57.542
Oh man, that guy's going down.

10:57.625 --> 10:59.166
If the President
of United States says

10:59.250 --> 11:00.500
he didn't do it,
he didn't.

11:00.583 --> 11:01.834
How would you know?

11:01.917 --> 11:03.500
He wouldn't lie
to the whole country, man.

11:03.583 --> 11:05.000
Well, everybody's saying
he's guilty.

11:05.083 --> 11:06.542
Well, I believe him.

11:06.625 --> 11:08.333
People gotta stay loyal.

11:08.417 --> 11:10.041
Like, Together We Stand.

11:10.125 --> 11:12.917
[chuckles]
You're the last boy scout,
Moon.

11:13.000 --> 11:15.125
[laughs]
Hey, how about a doob?

11:15.208 --> 11:16.792
I gotta split.

11:16.875 --> 11:19.208
- See you at weights tomorrow?
- Yeah, you'll see me.

11:19.291 --> 11:22.250
I'll be the guy, urgh,
out-benching you.

11:23.500 --> 11:25.083
[chuckles]
In your dreams.

11:29.166 --> 11:31.875
Oh, groove on, baby.

11:32.959 --> 11:34.750
Groove on.

11:34.834 --> 11:36.333
Gotta love the 70s.

11:36.417 --> 11:38.125
Instant replay and the pill.

11:38.208 --> 11:39.625
Two greatest inventions ever.

11:41.083 --> 11:43.250
So, who hosted this party,
someone's parents?

11:43.333 --> 11:44.834
Steve Pratt.

11:44.917 --> 11:46.000
Booster with big bucks.

11:46.083 --> 11:48.125
- They just opened up his
house?
- Sure.

11:48.208 --> 11:50.959
He recruited Moon.
Was real close with
him.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.875
Same Pratt who paid
for half the new stadium?

11:53.959 --> 11:55.417
Still comes to every game.

11:56.667 --> 11:57.583
Um, thanks, Breeze.

11:57.667 --> 11:59.333
We'll let you get back to it.

11:59.417 --> 12:00.875
Alright.

12:00.959 --> 12:02.083
See you.

12:03.375 --> 12:05.208
I remember two-a-day practices.

12:06.709 --> 12:07.834
Never been in such pain.

12:09.583 --> 12:10.875
Man, if I could go back.

12:13.750 --> 12:14.917
You ever play?

12:18.959 --> 12:20.208
Little bit.

12:31.000 --> 12:33.667
Heard Mike McShane spent
a lot of time here, Mr.
Pratt.

12:33.750 --> 12:38.041
Oh, hosted a few Warrior
parties
back in the day.

12:38.125 --> 12:39.500
They get kind of wild?

12:40.667 --> 12:42.417
[chuckles]
It was a different
time.

12:45.417 --> 12:47.667
Mike ever come to you
with any problems?

12:47.750 --> 12:49.041
Drugs or money?

12:49.125 --> 12:51.458
Mike was just a fun-loving kid

12:51.542 --> 12:55.375
who believed in God,
country and Warrior
football.

12:55.458 --> 12:56.750
You two close?

12:56.834 --> 12:59.875
Both small-town kids
who played big-time
ball.

12:59.959 --> 13:02.166
You knew that Mike grew
up
without a dad.

13:02.250 --> 13:04.333
Well, come rain or
shine,
I took him out

13:04.417 --> 13:06.333
for a good
dinner
once a week.

13:06.417 --> 13:08.166
That boy
needed a father
figure.

13:08.250 --> 13:11.417
Mr. Pratt, you never answered
my question about drug use.

13:13.458 --> 13:18.208
Mike worked two jobs, and
he
still couldn't make ends
meet.

13:21.208 --> 13:22.500
Thanks, honey.

13:23.542 --> 13:24.959
To you, Mike.

13:25.041 --> 13:26.917
Hell of a season so far.

13:27.000 --> 13:29.125
- Thanks, Mr. Pratt.
- Damn it, son.

13:29.208 --> 13:31.166
It's been three years.
Call me Steve.

13:31.250 --> 13:32.875
Sorry, Steve.

13:38.542 --> 13:40.792
I have never profited,
never profited..

13:40.875 --> 13:43.500
Can you believe this? The way
they're treating the
president?

13:44.458 --> 13:45.709
- Hey, Joe.
- Yeah.

13:45.792 --> 13:47.542
- Could you turn that thing
off?
- You got it.

13:48.625 --> 13:50.125
You seem a little preoccupied.

13:50.208 --> 13:51.875
Well, Mr. Pratt,
I hate to ask--

13:51.959 --> 13:53.166
Are you low on cash?

13:53.250 --> 13:56.083
- Just till the end of the
week.
- Say no more.

13:56.166 --> 13:58.333
Hope it's for a girl.

13:58.417 --> 13:59.792
Textbooks.

13:59.875 --> 14:01.625
Good one.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.375
Now, you remember..

14:03.458 --> 14:06.083
...you can always come to me,
okay?

14:06.166 --> 14:08.959
Warrior football
is about sticking together.

14:10.333 --> 14:12.166
And that ain't bull.

14:12.250 --> 14:13.583
No, sir.

14:16.500 --> 14:18.291
(Rush)
'You think the money
was for drugs?'

14:18.375 --> 14:20.166
Back then,
I would have said
no.

14:20.250 --> 14:21.959
Not a kid like Mike.

14:22.041 --> 14:25.625
But now, I've seen it
happen
to too many players.

14:25.709 --> 14:29.417
Someone named Pez
out with you that night?

14:29.500 --> 14:31.125
I don't think
I ever heard that
name.

14:31.208 --> 14:33.250
[whistles]
Hey!

14:33.333 --> 14:35.083
Careful of the pool.

14:35.166 --> 14:37.875
I've done everything I
can
to brainwash that boy

14:37.959 --> 14:39.458
into loving football.

14:39.542 --> 14:41.250
[chuckles]
But he likes soccer.

14:41.333 --> 14:43.792
The things you live
to see, detective.

14:45.375 --> 14:48.041
Well, I haven't been here
since the '04 playoffs.

14:48.125 --> 14:49.417
McNabb lit it up.

14:49.500 --> 14:51.250
[sighs]
Then the Super Bowl happened.

14:51.333 --> 14:52.667
Yeah, how much you lose
on that game?

14:52.750 --> 14:54.834
That's not the point.

14:54.917 --> 14:56.709
- 'Rusty Jenkins?'
- Yeah?

14:58.792 --> 15:01.291
You're the detectives here
about, uh, Bad Moon?

15:01.375 --> 15:03.208
You were parked
at Warrior Stadium that
morning?

15:03.291 --> 15:04.709
Yeah, firing up
the old barrel.

15:04.792 --> 15:06.083
You know, you got
to get that pork falling

15:06.166 --> 15:07.792
right off the bone
by game time.

15:07.875 --> 15:10.041
You ain't lived
till you've had my pork.

15:10.125 --> 15:12.041
Sounds delicious.
Now, about that
morning?

15:12.125 --> 15:14.750
- You said, you saw a car.
- Yeah, a red one.

15:14.834 --> 15:17.625
He busted out of there
like he robbed a bank.

15:22.625 --> 15:24.083
You get a good look
at the driver?

15:24.166 --> 15:25.417
Nah, it was too far away.

15:25.500 --> 15:26.667
Was the car a two-door?

15:26.750 --> 15:28.917
Yeah, it was like
one of them muscle cars.

15:29.000 --> 15:32.333
Uh, like a stock car
with a white stripe on the
side?

15:32.417 --> 15:33.917
Yeah, I think there was.

15:34.000 --> 15:36.166
That's a Plymouth Duster.
It's got to be.

15:37.750 --> 15:39.000
Well, thanks, Rusty.

15:41.417 --> 15:43.500
You should do repo work.

15:43.583 --> 15:45.834
Busted out of here
like a bank robber.

15:45.917 --> 15:48.000
Or a killer
fleeing
a crime scene.

15:48.083 --> 15:49.792
Well, missed out
on Rusty's pork.

15:54.250 --> 15:55.583
(Miller)
What are all these files?

15:55.667 --> 15:57.291
Records from the DMV.

15:58.625 --> 15:59.750
November '73.

16:01.083 --> 16:03.458
We're looking
for anything
suspicious..

16:03.542 --> 16:04.792
...in a red Plymouth Duster.

16:06.792 --> 16:08.542
[sighs]
You're evil.

16:15.458 --> 16:18.959
(Valens)
'Found your name in the
yearbook, Professor Boreki.'

16:20.291 --> 16:22.041
Mike McShane, a good friend
of yours?

16:22.125 --> 16:23.125
I was his tutor.

16:23.208 --> 16:25.125
So, why did he leave tickets
for you?

16:27.625 --> 16:31.125
Well, one of the supposed perks
of the job.

16:31.208 --> 16:33.583
- Guess I was next in line.
- Big fan, huh?

16:34.375 --> 16:36.250
[chuckles
]
No.

16:36.333 --> 16:37.875
Almost un-American, isn't it?

16:37.959 --> 16:41.000
- So why tutor those guys?
- I needed the money.

16:41.083 --> 16:42.917
Students who couldn't
throw
an inflated ball

16:43.000 --> 16:44.500
actually had to
pay
their own way.

16:45.792 --> 16:47.750
(McShane)
Whitney Fellowship?
What's that?

16:47.834 --> 16:51.166
It's an academic scholarship.
Gonna pay for my grad school.

16:51.250 --> 16:52.792
Free ride, just like me.

16:52.875 --> 16:54.417
What are you gonna study?

16:54.500 --> 16:56.792
You got a "Beowulf"
paper
due in two weeks.

16:56.875 --> 16:58.917
I can write that for
you
next weekend.

16:59.000 --> 17:01.333
Shouldn't you help me with it?

17:01.417 --> 17:03.458
You read "Beowulf?"

17:03.542 --> 17:04.625
Just started it.

17:04.709 --> 17:05.959
You should stick
to your playbook.

17:06.041 --> 17:08.250
I'll handle the paper, T-Bone.

17:08.333 --> 17:09.834
It's Bad Moon.

17:09.917 --> 17:12.458
You know, you guys sound
like a Ponderosa menu?

17:12.542 --> 17:14.917
T-Bone, Chunk, Rib Eye.

17:21.000 --> 17:23.917
You never had a nickname.
That's your problem.

17:27.834 --> 17:30.208
Don't worry.
I'll think of one for you.

17:30.291 --> 17:31.458
(female #1)
'Hey, Mike.'

17:31.542 --> 17:33.083
How you doing, Cynthia?

17:41.875 --> 17:44.000
These players needed guys
like me.

17:44.083 --> 17:47.458
They'd lose their eligibility
if their GPA fell below a 2.0.

17:47.542 --> 17:50.000
Uh, what about the pills
he was taking?

17:50.083 --> 17:51.625
I tutored a lot of players.

17:51.709 --> 17:53.625
They were always jacked
up
on something.

17:53.709 --> 17:56.250
- Painkillers or uppers.
- Where did they get the
drugs?

17:56.333 --> 17:59.125
They had some quack
supplying the whole team.

17:59.208 --> 18:02.834
Now this, uh, quack doctor,
uh, ever hear his name?

18:02.917 --> 18:06.250
No, I'm sorry, I really
wouldn't know about that.

18:06.333 --> 18:07.583
Name Pez ring any bells?

18:07.667 --> 18:11.500
No. You'd have to ask
someone on the team.

18:11.583 --> 18:12.792
Right, uh..

18:13.959 --> 18:16.166
You were just a...tutor.

18:20.375 --> 18:22.375
Uh, if you think
of anything else..

18:22.458 --> 18:24.542
...professor, let me know.

18:29.583 --> 18:31.000
(Mrs. McShane)
I don't understand.

18:31.083 --> 18:33.542
Mike was never sick
a day in his life.

18:33.625 --> 18:35.542
Your son never mentioned
taking any pills?

18:35.625 --> 18:36.709
Pills for what?

18:36.792 --> 18:38.875
Maybe to help recover
from a game?

18:38.959 --> 18:41.834
- Injury or pain?
- No.

18:41.917 --> 18:44.959
The-the team was
on a vitamin
program.

18:45.041 --> 18:46.041
A vitamin program?

18:46.125 --> 18:47.959
Yeah.
Mike never liked
it.

18:48.041 --> 18:51.875
He always hated needles from
the time he was a little boy.

18:51.959 --> 18:55.875
These vitamin shots, do you
know
who gave them to your son?

18:55.959 --> 18:58.625
No, he just told me
the whole team took
them.

19:02.959 --> 19:04.542
You wouldn't believe
all the trainers

19:04.625 --> 19:07.083
and doctors they have now.

19:07.166 --> 19:09.500
I used to have
to tape my own
ankles.

19:11.208 --> 19:13.125
What was the doctor's name
you saw back in the day?

19:14.291 --> 19:16.291
Uh, you mean the team doctor?

19:16.375 --> 19:17.875
No, the other one, uh..

19:17.959 --> 19:19.709
'...the guy off campus,
the local guy.'

19:19.792 --> 19:21.667
- Had a crazy nickname.
- Pez?

19:23.291 --> 19:24.542
What about him?

19:24.625 --> 19:27.125
Hooked you up with
painkillers,
cortisone, right?

19:27.208 --> 19:29.750
Whatever it took to get
the body back on the field.

19:31.291 --> 19:32.834
What about vitamin shots?

19:34.333 --> 19:35.542
Vitamin shots?

19:36.500 --> 19:37.750
What are you talking about?

19:40.166 --> 19:41.834
Do you remember
the doc's real name?

19:43.041 --> 19:44.542
What's he got to do..

19:45.834 --> 19:47.583
...with Bad Moon's murder?

19:47.667 --> 19:49.166
I don't know. We'll see.

19:50.667 --> 19:52.500
Long time ago, Will.

19:52.583 --> 19:54.750
Come on, Al,
you kicked up the dust

19:54.834 --> 19:56.750
on this case,
brought it to me.

19:56.834 --> 19:58.500
Where you going with this?

20:00.500 --> 20:02.375
Thinking steroids.

20:02.458 --> 20:05.208
Back then?
I never saw it.

20:05.291 --> 20:08.000
No, the Warriors
ran a clean program.

20:08.083 --> 20:10.625
Then why go under the table
for shots?

20:10.709 --> 20:13.417
'Except to break NCAA rules,
not to mention the law.'

20:14.875 --> 20:16.291
I don't believe it.

20:16.375 --> 20:18.041
'Then tell me
the doctor's name.'

20:21.375 --> 20:23.291
If you're right..

20:23.375 --> 20:25.125
'...and this gets out..'

20:25.208 --> 20:27.542
...the whole program,
even now..

20:27.625 --> 20:29.083
...people will get hurt.

20:29.166 --> 20:30.834
Screw the Warriors program, Al.

20:30.917 --> 20:32.208
A kid got murdered.

20:33.542 --> 20:34.875
'We gotta see this through.'

20:36.542 --> 20:37.917
Just give me a name.

20:40.542 --> 20:43.000
(Valens)
'Nice digs you got here,
Dr. Lason.'

20:43.083 --> 20:44.667
'I understand you did some work'

20:44.750 --> 20:46.500
'with the Warriors
back in the day.'

20:46.583 --> 20:49.083
(Rush)
Former players are
starting to talk.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.500
Your name keeps coming up, Pez.

20:52.917 --> 20:54.667
I run a sports medicine clinic.

20:54.750 --> 20:56.083
I make my money
on player
referrals.

20:56.166 --> 20:58.166
Did you have a red Duster
back in the 70s?

20:58.250 --> 21:01.208
No, and I don't think I
like
the tone of this
conversation.

21:01.291 --> 21:03.417
You called Mike the night
before he was killed.

21:03.500 --> 21:04.542
Wanted to meet.

21:04.625 --> 21:06.333
That just a bad coincidence,
doc?

21:09.625 --> 21:10.542
My attorney's number.

21:10.625 --> 21:11.625
You were involved in a drug ring

21:11.709 --> 21:12.917
where a kid ended up dead.

21:13.000 --> 21:14.500
Now, thanks for your time,
Dr. Lason.

21:14.583 --> 21:16.917
If we have any more questions,
we'll give you a call.

21:19.792 --> 21:20.959
What's up?

21:22.625 --> 21:24.667
Check out Dr.
Lason's
golf buddy.

21:26.000 --> 21:27.250
(Valens)
'Son of a bitch.'

21:28.083 --> 21:30.375
Yeah, popular guy, this Pratt.

21:34.417 --> 21:36.333
A big game tomorrow.

21:36.417 --> 21:39.583
Oh, playing
Michigan
for the 75th time.

21:39.667 --> 21:41.709
You gotta love
college
tradition.

21:41.792 --> 21:44.250
Mmm, tradition
like doping the players?

21:47.959 --> 21:49.083
I don't understand.

21:49.166 --> 21:52.333
Dr. Lason, steroids,
your money.

21:53.250 --> 21:55.291
Understand?

21:55.375 --> 21:57.417
Mike was just like
the rest of the
boys.

21:57.500 --> 21:59.500
He would do
anything
to play ball.

21:59.583 --> 22:01.083
Including taking steroids?

22:03.792 --> 22:06.542
[chuckles]
Nobody knew the side
effects.

22:06.625 --> 22:09.834
Hell, nobody even knew
what they were back
then.

22:09.917 --> 22:11.709
Not that you bothered
to find out.

22:11.792 --> 22:13.583
We thought
we were helping
him.

22:13.667 --> 22:15.625
It had nothing to
do
with Mike's death.

22:15.709 --> 22:18.083
So why was he calling Dr. Lason?

22:18.166 --> 22:19.625
It was about Breeze.

22:26.000 --> 22:27.125
You okay, man?

22:29.333 --> 22:31.792
I'm okay. I'm okay.

22:32.917 --> 22:34.166
'Are you sure?'

22:34.250 --> 22:36.125
Uh, just don't say
anything
to coach.

22:36.208 --> 22:37.917
Come on, Breeze.
Something's wrong here.

22:38.000 --> 22:39.208
I'm begging you, Mike.

22:39.291 --> 22:41.291
'Don't tell them, please.'

22:45.875 --> 22:48.000
'Don't, don't.'

22:48.083 --> 22:49.250
Mr. Pratt.

22:54.083 --> 22:55.583
What did you do?

22:55.667 --> 22:58.792
My advice was for
him
to tell the coach.

22:58.875 --> 23:01.709
Turns out that
Breeze had a bad kidney

23:01.792 --> 23:03.917
which he didn't want
the team to know
about.

23:04.000 --> 23:07.583
- A life-threatening
condition.
- And when was this?

23:07.667 --> 23:09.834
Couple of days
before Mike
died.

23:09.917 --> 23:13.583
Mike must have called Dr. Lason
to take a look at Breeze.

23:13.667 --> 23:15.208
That when the coach
let Breeze go?

23:16.458 --> 23:17.917
Yes.

23:18.000 --> 23:20.041
And Breeze blamed Mike for it.

23:21.583 --> 23:23.166
Well, I sure hope not.

23:26.542 --> 23:28.667
(Valens)
It's not looking good
for the Breezeman.

23:28.750 --> 23:31.083
Being kicked off the team,
lying about Pez.

23:31.166 --> 23:33.834
Hmm, a little 'roid
rage.
Bad stuff happens.

23:33.917 --> 23:36.542
Hmm, I'm pulling him
in tomorrow morning.

23:36.625 --> 23:38.875
Thinks he's gonna look
at mug shots.

23:39.000 --> 23:40.166
It's kinda sad.

23:40.250 --> 23:42.417
'These guys
still so stuck in it.'

23:42.500 --> 23:44.083
(Miller)
'The glory days.'

23:44.166 --> 23:46.041
'I keep waiting
for mine to start.'

23:46.125 --> 23:47.750
(Valens)
'I'm outtie.'

23:48.625 --> 23:50.750
Outtie? What are you 16?

23:50.834 --> 23:52.792
Oh, sorry,
granny,
I must depart.

23:55.208 --> 23:56.792
I'll see you guys tomorrow.

23:56.875 --> 23:58.166
(Valens)
'Yep.'

24:00.917 --> 24:02.500
Two of whatever
this guy's
having.

24:04.583 --> 24:05.792
Detective Rush.

24:07.166 --> 24:10.166
I'd say you were lookin'
smokin' hot but..

24:10.250 --> 24:12.333
...it'd be an inappropriation
to my co-worker.

24:12.417 --> 24:13.959
I wouldn't want that.

24:16.250 --> 24:18.500
Inappropriation a word?

24:18.583 --> 24:20.625
Should be.

24:20.709 --> 24:23.208
I came over
'cause I got a
question.

24:23.291 --> 24:25.333
Question away.

24:25.417 --> 24:27.875
You were talking to that
addict
on the last job.

24:27.959 --> 24:30.041
How it is
when you start using.

24:30.125 --> 24:31.500
You're free.

24:31.583 --> 24:33.375
You're flyin'.

24:33.458 --> 24:34.959
Sounds like you've been there.

24:35.041 --> 24:38.208
So you're thinkin' what's a
guy
in NA doin' in a bar?

24:38.291 --> 24:41.125
That, or you're a better
liar
than I am.

24:41.208 --> 24:43.041
Oh, liar?

24:44.625 --> 24:47.709
I consider us storytellers.

24:47.792 --> 24:50.041
You know, like I came over
'cause I got a question.

24:50.125 --> 24:52.709
[chuckles]
That was no
story.

24:52.792 --> 24:54.291
There you go again.

24:55.917 --> 24:57.041
You're a tricky guy.

24:57.125 --> 24:58.291
I got you, detective.

25:05.500 --> 25:07.166
That's what you're having?

25:07.250 --> 25:09.208
Appletini. Problem?

25:10.250 --> 25:12.083
What sorority you pledge in?

25:12.166 --> 25:14.083
[chuckles]
It's good.

25:14.166 --> 25:15.417
Don't knock good.

25:20.000 --> 25:22.208
Hmm, don't knock good.

25:22.291 --> 25:23.709
(Saccardo)
'Check this out.'

25:27.083 --> 25:28.417
Ta-da!

25:28.500 --> 25:31.083
Oh, you got talent. Gotta say.

25:31.166 --> 25:32.417
I could teach ya.

25:32.500 --> 25:33.625
The bar trick?

25:33.709 --> 25:36.083
Yeah, but then you have
to join my sorority.

25:36.166 --> 25:37.834
Are you making
an inappropriation?

25:47.667 --> 25:49.542
Thanks for comin' in.

25:49.625 --> 25:51.250
Sorry.

25:51.333 --> 25:52.709
That smile for me?

25:54.041 --> 25:55.917
The hoagie.

25:56.000 --> 25:57.375
He in there?

25:57.458 --> 25:58.750
Got him waitin'.

26:04.625 --> 26:05.750
- Morning.
- Morning.

26:05.834 --> 26:07.417
(Valens)
'This is Detective Rush.'

26:07.500 --> 26:09.291
Nice to meet you.

26:09.375 --> 26:10.792
Said you might have a suspect.

26:10.875 --> 26:12.625
Yeah, you.

26:12.709 --> 26:15.875
Let's count the
lies.
Pez, steroid use.

26:15.959 --> 26:18.000
How they booted you
off
the team.

26:18.083 --> 26:19.542
- I miss anything?
- Oh, yeah.

26:19.625 --> 26:21.250
The one where he had nothing
to do with Mike's death.

26:21.333 --> 26:22.542
I didn't. I swear.

26:22.625 --> 26:24.125
They didn't just kick
you
off the team.

26:24.208 --> 26:25.500
They took away your scholarship.

26:25.583 --> 26:26.959
(Valens)
'Now you didn't keep up
your grades'

26:27.041 --> 26:29.000
so they sent you packing.

26:29.083 --> 26:30.709
And it was all Mike's fault.

26:30.792 --> 26:32.250
Your best friend betrayed you.

26:32.333 --> 26:34.500
No way he did that.
He stood up for me.

26:34.583 --> 26:37.500
The thing with Mike is that
he thought with his heart.

26:37.583 --> 26:39.583
Told the truth,
and that can get you

26:39.667 --> 26:41.000
into trouble with some people.

26:45.291 --> 26:46.709
Hey, hold on.

26:48.417 --> 26:50.208
Taking away my scholarship too.

26:51.959 --> 26:53.959
Together We Stand, my ass.

26:54.041 --> 26:56.417
I'm sorry, Breeze.

26:56.500 --> 26:59.291
- I didn't mean to--
- It's not your fault, man.

26:59.375 --> 27:02.291
It's just, just bad luck.

27:02.375 --> 27:03.834
- 'There you are.'
- Not now.

27:03.917 --> 27:05.375
I'm trying to save your ass
from flunking.

27:05.458 --> 27:06.917
Your "Beowulf" paper
was due this morning.

27:07.041 --> 27:08.291
I turned it in.

27:08.375 --> 27:09.667
You were supposed
to give it to me.

27:09.750 --> 27:11.166
You know,
it's half your grade.

27:11.250 --> 27:12.542
You get an F, I'm the one
who takes the heat.

27:12.625 --> 27:14.041
I got a team meeting.

27:14.125 --> 27:15.875
The same team who just took away
the halfback scholarship?

27:15.959 --> 27:17.375
'He gets sick, all of a
sudden,
they got a problem'

27:17.458 --> 27:18.375
'with his GPA?'

27:18.458 --> 27:20.583
That's a mistake I'm gonna fix.

27:20.667 --> 27:21.875
I'll get Breeze
back
on the team.

27:21.959 --> 27:24.542
A mistake?
Come on, Mad Dog.

27:24.625 --> 27:25.875
Those 'roids
are clouding your head.

27:25.959 --> 27:27.208
I'm not on
steroids,
you little
maggot.

27:27.291 --> 27:28.500
So you become a Warrior,
and suddenly

27:28.583 --> 27:29.875
you're benching 400 pounds?

27:29.959 --> 27:31.375
You don't know what
you're talking
about.

27:31.458 --> 27:32.959
No, it's simple, Mike.

27:33.041 --> 27:34.375
You pass, you play.

27:34.458 --> 27:35.834
Team wins,
school makes money.

27:35.917 --> 27:37.458
Everybody's happy.

27:37.542 --> 27:38.709
That's how it works.

27:38.792 --> 27:39.875
You're a dollar bill to them.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.458
You're the one
getting paid
here.

27:41.542 --> 27:43.959
And if I
flunk,
you're done.

27:44.041 --> 27:45.542
I'm a dollar bill to you.

27:45.625 --> 27:47.834
Don't worry about me.
I got a life after college.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.750
Wonder what would happen
to your stupid fellowship

27:49.834 --> 27:51.875
if they knew you cheated
for football players.

27:58.500 --> 28:00.166
That kid was pissed off.

28:00.250 --> 28:03.041
Are you saying the nerd
bashed
the fullback's head in?

28:03.125 --> 28:04.750
Doesn't take much
to sneak up on somebody.

28:04.834 --> 28:06.208
That takes a coward,
right, Breeze?

28:06.291 --> 28:07.917
And it is about you.

28:08.000 --> 28:10.000
Moon took away
your football
career.

28:10.083 --> 28:12.875
I was in the emergency room
all day that Saturday.

28:12.959 --> 28:15.041
The doctors were trying
to save my kidney.

28:15.125 --> 28:16.250
The same kidney made worse

28:16.333 --> 28:17.792
by the steroids they fed you.

28:17.875 --> 28:18.750
Yeah.

28:18.834 --> 28:20.166
The way they treated you..

28:21.417 --> 28:22.875
How could you work there?

28:24.750 --> 28:26.041
It's the only thing I got.

28:28.667 --> 28:29.834
I tell you what.

28:31.500 --> 28:33.792
In that backfield with Moon..

28:33.875 --> 28:36.417
[chuckles]
Still the best days of my
life.

28:40.208 --> 28:42.542
Quit shoving me,
man.
I got rights.

28:42.625 --> 28:44.291
Can it or I
tighten
the bracelets.

28:51.959 --> 28:53.291
Who's she?

28:53.375 --> 28:55.375
Detective
Rush.
She's cool.

28:55.458 --> 28:57.458
Well, then get these damn
things
off me, man.

28:59.208 --> 29:01.166
That glorious stench?

29:01.250 --> 29:02.709
Chanel dumpster No. 5.

29:02.792 --> 29:04.208
That's alight, captain says
you're gonna remember

29:04.291 --> 29:06.125
what it's like
to stink real soon.

29:06.208 --> 29:07.458
You going someplace,
Saccardo?

29:07.542 --> 29:09.875
Joint operation with the
feds
coming down.

29:09.959 --> 29:11.208
Just waiting to hear.

29:12.458 --> 29:14.083
Oh, send me a postcard.

29:21.125 --> 29:22.792
Uh, yeah, no, I'm not kidding.

29:22.875 --> 29:26.583
Uh, it's about the hit-and-run
report you filed 30 years ago.

29:26.667 --> 29:29.959
Yeah, a red Duster hit your
car
near the university

29:30.041 --> 29:32.166
around 10:00 a.m.

29:32.250 --> 29:33.375
Yeah.

29:34.875 --> 29:37.291
Uh, did you get a look
at the driver?

29:41.083 --> 29:44.500
Uh, it says in the report the,
the Duster that hit your car

29:44.583 --> 29:46.333
had no plates.

29:46.417 --> 29:48.417
Uh, dealer
plates
or no plates?

29:49.583 --> 29:51.458
Um, my assistant wants to know

29:51.542 --> 29:52.834
if they were, uh, dealer plates.

29:54.291 --> 29:55.417
Yeah.

29:56.667 --> 29:58.333
Thanks, pal.

29:58.417 --> 30:00.041
Dealer plates.

30:00.125 --> 30:03.625
Suspect was fleeing the scene
in a brand-spanking-new car.

30:03.709 --> 30:04.917
Let's find us a Duster.

30:05.000 --> 30:06.125
Um-hmm.

30:07.959 --> 30:10.375
So how did you afford
grad school with no
loans?

30:10.458 --> 30:12.667
Well, what does this have to
do
with Mike McShane?

30:12.750 --> 30:15.458
Mike was gonna tell
those fancy scholarship
guys

30:15.542 --> 30:17.208
that you were a cheat.

30:17.291 --> 30:18.583
You knew after Mike
left
the tickets

30:18.667 --> 30:20.709
he'd take the
shortcut
back to the dorm.

30:20.792 --> 30:22.709
- 'You wait for him,
professor?'
- If you think--

30:22.792 --> 30:23.917
We think..

30:25.041 --> 30:26.208
...you saw Mike again.

30:26.291 --> 30:27.875
Bashed the guy's head in.

30:27.959 --> 30:29.750
Alright, I was mad at him.

30:39.166 --> 30:40.375
Maybe it was my fault.

30:41.667 --> 30:44.917
- Your fault?
- If I just hadn't..

30:45.000 --> 30:46.917
I don't know,
shined the light..

30:49.834 --> 30:51.875
...maybe he'd be alive.

30:59.667 --> 31:01.250
I just met with a
doctor
in town.

31:02.875 --> 31:04.500
He said I had
signs
of liver damage.

31:05.500 --> 31:06.750
Side effect of steroids.

31:10.542 --> 31:11.917
I can't believe
they did this to
me.

31:14.125 --> 31:15.583
To all of us.

31:18.000 --> 31:19.458
I should have listened to you..

31:19.542 --> 31:20.917
...about a lot of things.

31:21.000 --> 31:22.166
I don't know anything.

31:24.375 --> 31:27.125
I stopped by your English
prof's office.

31:27.208 --> 31:28.458
Just graded
your "Beowulf" paper.

31:28.542 --> 31:29.500
How bad was it?

31:29.583 --> 31:31.208
Got a B plus

31:31.291 --> 31:32.458
all on your own.

31:33.375 --> 31:34.792
No way.

31:34.875 --> 31:37.291
Maybe I should
have listened to you.

31:37.375 --> 31:40.125
Now don't get all sappy on
me,
you little twerp.

31:40.208 --> 31:42.500
- You still gonna play
tomorrow?
- Why?

31:42.583 --> 31:43.917
Just figured maybe
you weren't gonna be

31:44.000 --> 31:45.083
playing for those idiots
anymore.

31:45.166 --> 31:46.500
Fall football.

31:48.375 --> 31:49.625
Chill in the air

31:49.709 --> 31:52.625
pads crackin',
fans screamin'

31:52.709 --> 31:54.500
going so hard
you think you might
die

31:54.583 --> 31:55.917
but then you don't.

31:57.291 --> 31:58.583
They can't take that away.

32:00.750 --> 32:03.250
"Let him who may win glory
before death, for that is
best."

32:03.333 --> 32:06.417
"At last
for the departed
warrior."

32:08.583 --> 32:09.709
You really did read it.

32:09.792 --> 32:11.417
I'll leave you
tickets
for the game.

32:14.750 --> 32:16.625
Hey.

32:16.709 --> 32:18.000
I thought of a nickname for you.

32:19.583 --> 32:20.875
I was gonna go with Bones

32:20.959 --> 32:22.834
'but then it hit me.'

32:22.917 --> 32:24.166
Wiglaf.

32:25.875 --> 32:27.166
Thanks, Bad Moon.

32:32.417 --> 32:33.709
(Stillman)
'Wiglaf.'

32:33.792 --> 32:35.792
That's from "Beowulf."

32:35.875 --> 32:39.542
Yeah, the only warrior
who stood by Beowulf at the
end.

32:41.625 --> 32:43.625
Helped him slay the dragon.

32:43.709 --> 32:46.208
- Mike's way of saying thanks.
- I guess so.

32:46.291 --> 32:48.125
Did Mike tell you
what he was gonna do?

32:48.208 --> 32:52.875
Uh, he said he was gonna talk
to Coach Walters about Breeze.

32:52.959 --> 32:54.750
Thought he never had
the chance, but now, uh..

32:54.834 --> 32:57.000
You think,
Mike stood up to
Walters.

32:57.083 --> 32:59.041
It would have been the first,
that's for sure.

33:12.291 --> 33:14.834
You got a lot
to answer for, coach.

33:14.917 --> 33:18.041
Treating those players
like disposable meat.

33:18.125 --> 33:20.041
They were treated like kings.

33:20.125 --> 33:22.041
[chuckles]
'Oh, yeah?'

33:22.125 --> 33:23.417
'Breeze too?'

33:24.917 --> 33:25.959
Breeze got sick.

33:26.041 --> 33:27.834
Because of your steroid program.

33:29.291 --> 33:31.500
'Mike ever come to you
to talk about it?'

33:32.834 --> 33:35.250
Yeah, he came to me.
Friday night.

33:35.333 --> 33:36.417
Not Saturday morning.

33:36.500 --> 33:38.458
That's convenient for you.

33:38.542 --> 33:41.625
I was with the coaching staff
all Saturday morning.

33:41.709 --> 33:44.750
Then about 70,000 witnesses
saw me on the sidelines.

33:44.834 --> 33:45.875
Why don't you call one?

33:45.959 --> 33:47.750
You like that, don't you?

33:47.834 --> 33:49.583
'Fans cheering.'

33:49.667 --> 33:51.625
'All that glory
on Saturdays.'

33:51.709 --> 33:53.583
Bet you'd do anything
to keep it.

33:53.667 --> 33:56.417
- Anything to shut Mike up.
- I didn't kill Mike.

33:56.500 --> 33:58.750
Then what did you say to him?

33:58.834 --> 34:00.083
Not a hell of a lot.

34:03.250 --> 34:05.750
But with Breeze off the team,
he loses his scholarship.

34:05.834 --> 34:07.625
If he can't keep his grades up--

34:07.709 --> 34:09.625
But that was never a problem
when he was starting, was it?

34:13.834 --> 34:15.458
He's given everything
to the team.

34:17.208 --> 34:19.333
I mean, Together We Stand,
right, coach?

34:19.417 --> 34:20.458
Finished?

34:20.542 --> 34:21.625
I-I just think
that we need to--

34:21.709 --> 34:23.291
Get the hell out of my office.

34:26.542 --> 34:27.875
You don't give a rat's ass
about us, do you?

34:27.959 --> 34:29.166
Now watch yourself, boy.

34:31.959 --> 34:34.750
Walk away before you lose
your own damn scholarship.

34:35.709 --> 34:36.709
You'd do that, wouldn't you?

34:36.792 --> 34:38.250
Just put your pads on tomorrow

34:38.333 --> 34:39.583
and be a Warrior.

34:43.834 --> 34:46.000
I will never put on
a Warrior jersey again

34:46.083 --> 34:47.333
you son of a bitch.

34:56.166 --> 34:57.709
(Jeffries)
'And you let that stand?'

34:57.792 --> 34:59.333
He would have played.

34:59.417 --> 35:00.667
'They always do.'

35:00.750 --> 35:02.875
Besides..

35:02.959 --> 35:06.083
...not my job
to mollycoddle players.

35:06.166 --> 35:08.625
Now, that's what
the boosters are for, right?

35:08.709 --> 35:11.083
Take 'em to dinner,
slip the players cash.

35:11.166 --> 35:12.417
'Handle a mess like Mike.'

35:12.500 --> 35:14.000
Your point?

35:15.125 --> 35:17.500
Steve Pratt did the dirty work.

35:17.583 --> 35:19.125
You called him, right?

35:23.583 --> 35:26.959
After all these years,
still beholden to Steve Pratt.

35:28.458 --> 35:30.542
You needed your new stadium,
right?

35:35.125 --> 35:36.625
This used to be a game, coach.

35:37.959 --> 35:39.458
You ever miss that?

35:51.291 --> 35:52.458
(Vera)
'George.'

35:52.542 --> 35:54.166
You folks being helped?

35:54.250 --> 35:55.500
Steve Pratt sent us.

35:55.583 --> 35:57.709
[chuckles]
Why didn't you say so?

35:57.792 --> 35:59.125
You affiliated with the program?

35:59.208 --> 36:00.583
Class of '92.

36:00.667 --> 36:02.417
'Looking for a Duster.'

36:02.500 --> 36:04.792
They stopped making those
in the 70s.

36:04.875 --> 36:06.500
We used to sell a ton of 'em.

36:06.583 --> 36:09.583
Well, Steve said he
test-drove
one once. That true?

36:09.667 --> 36:11.542
Sure, the players loved them.

36:13.333 --> 36:14.667
Tell us more.

36:17.750 --> 36:20.709
(Valens)
'Looked you up in some old
Warrior programs, Steve.'

36:20.792 --> 36:23.041
Can't seem
to find your game stats.

36:23.125 --> 36:25.333
Well, I was on the team.

36:25.417 --> 36:27.166
We went to the Orange Bowl.

36:27.250 --> 36:30.375
But you never played.
Does that even count?

36:31.667 --> 36:33.583
It counts.

36:33.667 --> 36:35.125
Well, you've been pretending
you're somebody else

36:35.208 --> 36:39.083
for a long time 'cause
you were nothing like Bad Moon.

36:39.166 --> 36:40.583
(Valens)
'Well, you're..'

36:40.667 --> 36:42.291
'...warming the bench.'

36:42.375 --> 36:45.166
Together we...sit.

36:45.250 --> 36:48.709
You two, I don't know what
the hell you're talking
about.

36:48.792 --> 36:50.834
Mike was like a son to you.

36:50.917 --> 36:52.917
Must have stung when he said
he was leaving the team.

36:53.000 --> 36:56.291
- He was his own man.
- You try and talk to him?

36:56.375 --> 36:58.375
I mean, he must have
come to you if it
was..

36:59.667 --> 37:02.458
...just a talking-to
that we can
understand.

37:06.625 --> 37:08.041
I had a chat with your buddy

37:08.125 --> 37:10.709
at the Dodge
Dealership
over in Roxborough.

37:10.792 --> 37:12.917
He lent you a red Duster
the morning Mike was
killed.

37:13.000 --> 37:15.041
Same one you returned
after the hit-and-run.

37:17.083 --> 37:19.458
You know, there's gotta
be some mistake.

37:19.542 --> 37:20.625
No mistake.

37:20.709 --> 37:22.000
Got a tailgater who ID'd you

37:22.083 --> 37:24.917
driving away
from the crime scene at 9:30.

37:27.166 --> 37:30.083
Well, I can go get
our witness right now

37:30.166 --> 37:33.709
and put you through a line-up,
lie detector.

37:33.792 --> 37:34.959
Up to you.

37:41.625 --> 37:46.000
You took him for a drive
just to talk, right?

37:46.083 --> 37:47.667
To work it out.

37:47.750 --> 37:51.000
You always had a way
with those kids, didn't
you?

37:51.083 --> 37:54.375
Just went for a drive
to talk.

37:54.458 --> 37:57.000
You were the
father
he never had.

37:57.083 --> 37:59.083
Always tried
to be there for him.

37:59.166 --> 38:02.333
Well, you gave everything
to Mike.

38:02.417 --> 38:04.166
You rescued him
from his small
town.

38:04.250 --> 38:05.375
Yeah, you threw parties.

38:05.458 --> 38:07.792
You took him
to fancy
restaurants.

38:07.875 --> 38:09.125
You made that kid.

38:10.125 --> 38:11.834
I treated him like a son.

38:11.917 --> 38:13.792
(Valens)
And how does Mike thank you?

38:13.875 --> 38:15.542
Stirring up trouble.

38:15.625 --> 38:16.625
Going behind your back.

38:16.709 --> 38:18.208
The coach calls you to fix it.

38:18.291 --> 38:20.667
'That's your job.
To take care of it.'

38:20.750 --> 38:22.959
When Mike starts
talking,
you lose everything.

38:23.041 --> 38:24.709
And the games, the parties.

38:24.792 --> 38:26.000
A son.

38:27.250 --> 38:29.208
I tried.

38:29.291 --> 38:32.917
I tried to tell him
not to do it.

38:33.000 --> 38:34.333
Not to do what, Steve?

38:36.041 --> 38:37.750
(Rush)
'Tell us what happened,
Steve.'

38:37.834 --> 38:40.000
Tell us so you don't have
to live with this anymore.

38:41.291 --> 38:42.667
God help me.

38:51.959 --> 38:53.542
[sighs]
Well..

38:53.625 --> 38:55.750
'I was gonna wait
till after the game, but..'

38:57.166 --> 38:59.458
[laughs]
That's all yours,
son.

38:59.542 --> 39:00.959
You deserve it.

39:01.041 --> 39:03.542
Imagine driving through campus
in this baby.

39:03.625 --> 39:05.583
Pretty blonde riding shotgun.

39:05.667 --> 39:07.417
You think this is about a car?

39:13.417 --> 39:16.208
- What, Mike?
- Don't you get it?

39:16.291 --> 39:17.583
You-you're ruining the game
I love.

39:17.667 --> 39:18.792
You're thinking too much, Mike.

39:18.875 --> 39:20.500
You don't want me to think,
you pump us

39:20.583 --> 39:21.792
full of steroids
without telling us.

39:21.875 --> 39:23.917
- Those things help you.
- Uh, it's cheating.

39:25.041 --> 39:26.750
It isn't right.

39:26.834 --> 39:28.750
Look, I came here to play
ball
and get a degree.

39:28.834 --> 39:31.000
Well, guess what? You
don't
play, you don't get a
degree.

39:31.083 --> 39:33.083
- 'Okay? So buck up.'
- Now, my grades are good.

39:33.166 --> 39:34.834
I can get a scholarship
anywhere in the country.

39:34.917 --> 39:36.250
Mike, come on, okay?

39:36.333 --> 39:37.917
Nobody's talking about
you
leaving here.

39:38.041 --> 39:40.208
I'm not staying
unless Breeze does.

39:40.291 --> 39:42.125
- Unless certain things
change.
- Oh, my God.

39:42.208 --> 39:43.458
What the hell
is wrong with
you?

39:43.542 --> 39:47.000
Do you have any idea
how lucky you are?

39:47.083 --> 39:48.500
How stupid you're
being
right now?

39:48.583 --> 39:50.291
I trusted you.

39:50.375 --> 39:51.834
You know, I-I actually..

39:54.583 --> 39:56.375
I was wrong.

39:56.458 --> 39:58.709
Oh, what, about me?
Is that what you're
saying?

39:58.792 --> 40:00.458
I discovered you, okay?

40:00.542 --> 40:02.000
I made you everything you are.

40:02.083 --> 40:03.750
You'd still be pumping gas
back in Latrobe.

40:03.834 --> 40:05.625
- That's not true.
- 'You've eaten at my table.'

40:05.709 --> 40:07.458
You never said no to a
freebie,
did ya?

40:07.542 --> 40:09.750
- Fifty here, fifty there.
- That was for books.

40:09.834 --> 40:11.125
You think this is easy?

40:11.208 --> 40:13.125
Everything I do for
you?
For all my boys?

40:14.333 --> 40:15.667
- Your boys?
- Yeah.

40:16.792 --> 40:18.166
Your boys think you're a joke.

40:18.250 --> 40:20.333
- What did you say?
- You're a benchwarmer.

40:20.417 --> 40:22.000
You're trying to relive
glory
you never had in the--

40:22.083 --> 40:23.792
- You shut your mouth.
- No.

40:23.875 --> 40:26.041
If you're what
being a Warrior is..

40:26.125 --> 40:27.291
...forget it.
