WEBVTT

00:05.840 --> 00:07.132
Whose ghosts are they?

00:07.215 --> 00:08.467
Why are they haunting Pac-Man?

00:08.550 --> 00:09.802
What did he do to them?

00:09.885 --> 00:11.720
Mm-hmm, and Kimmy Time is up.

00:11.804 --> 00:12.906
But we didn't even get to talk about

00:12.930 --> 00:14.389
why the guy in <i>Operation </i> is awake.

00:14.556 --> 00:15.891
His eyes are open,

00:15.975 --> 00:17.601
and he's having, like, nine surgeries.

00:17.768 --> 00:19.227
Please, Kimbrella.

00:19.394 --> 00:21.229
This is why we have
the Kimmy Time system...

00:21.396 --> 00:22.998
so we can talk about
more important things,

00:23.022 --> 00:24.023
like Titus.

00:24.107 --> 00:25.609
I hear he has news.

00:25.693 --> 00:27.361
Now that I'm no longer legally dead,

00:27.444 --> 00:29.005
the restaurant is actually able to pay me.

00:29.029 --> 00:30.572
Wait, you haven't been getting paid?

00:30.739 --> 00:32.133
I'm used to getting paid under the table.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.969
People drop some really cool stuff
under there.

00:33.993 --> 00:35.202
Ooh.

00:35.369 --> 00:36.930
I just don't know what to spend
all this money on.

00:36.954 --> 00:39.206
How about rent, utilities?

00:39.289 --> 00:40.624
Unicorns, leprechauns.

00:40.791 --> 00:42.584
Let's get real.

00:42.751 --> 00:44.837
I'm gonna use this money
for something for myself.

00:44.920 --> 00:47.255
Fine, I'll keep covering
the rent and the tapes,

00:47.339 --> 00:49.800
but you have to use this money
for something that matters,

00:49.884 --> 00:51.635
like... that.

00:52.803 --> 00:53.637
DJs?

00:53.804 --> 00:55.263
Ew. No.

00:55.347 --> 00:56.473
Their poor parents.

00:56.557 --> 00:57.557
No.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.601
I want you to put on a show.

01:00.895 --> 01:02.021
Yes.

01:02.103 --> 01:04.355
I am in the midst
of a personal renaissance...

01:04.438 --> 01:06.483
my finances, my love life,

01:06.650 --> 01:07.776
my eyebrow game.

01:07.860 --> 01:09.403
And now your art.

01:09.486 --> 01:11.780
Maybe it's a play about aliens
who come to Earth,

01:11.864 --> 01:13.741
and if they're gonna save that rec center,

01:13.824 --> 01:15.659
they're gonna need to start dancing.

01:15.826 --> 01:19.287
No, I'm gonna do what
every actor's friends love most...

01:19.371 --> 01:20.455
a one-man show,

01:20.622 --> 01:23.584
about the most scintillating subject
on God's gray earth.

01:23.751 --> 01:25.669
- You?
- No, baby girl.

01:25.753 --> 01:27.629
- Me.
- Great.

01:27.796 --> 01:29.088
A performance space?

01:30.591 --> 01:32.133
Cool kick, Lillian.

01:32.217 --> 01:34.344
This neighborhood is changing,

01:34.428 --> 01:37.096
and none of us are gonna
be able to live here.

01:37.264 --> 01:41.894
And they painted over
the neighborhood mural of Biggie.

01:42.061 --> 01:44.229
Now how are we supposed
to remember he's dead?

01:44.312 --> 01:46.899
Why would anyone bother
to paint a wall in this neighborhood?

01:46.982 --> 01:48.108
It's just gonna get tagged.

01:48.275 --> 01:49.526
But it hasn't.

01:49.693 --> 01:51.862
Yesterday, this happened.

01:51.946 --> 01:55.156
Twenty-four hours and not one graffito.

01:55.323 --> 01:56.324
What a disgrace.

01:57.952 --> 01:58.786
Sorry, guys.

01:58.869 --> 02:01.288
Jacqueline needs me
to "get the duck over here,"

02:01.371 --> 02:03.665
so I've got to figure out
where to get one.

02:03.749 --> 02:04.833
Central Park.

02:08.294 --> 02:09.463
So young.

02:09.630 --> 02:11.506
So talented.

02:11.590 --> 02:13.341
So fat.

02:13.425 --> 02:14.509
Mm.

02:47.542 --> 02:49.544
but then some sort of duck policeman...

02:50.295 --> 02:52.464
Whoa. Look at this place.

02:52.547 --> 02:55.676
Yes. Well, I can only afford to stay here
until Christmas.

02:55.759 --> 02:57.094
The clock is ticking, Kimmy.

02:57.260 --> 02:59.387
Like the <i>60 Minutes </i> theme song.

03:00.639 --> 03:02.265
Here, I'll help unpack.

03:04.225 --> 03:05.225
Whoa!

03:07.938 --> 03:09.481
Are those empty?

03:09.564 --> 03:11.399
Or was one of the spiders that bit me...

03:11.566 --> 03:12.567
They're empty.

03:12.651 --> 03:13.735
Thanks to the divorce,

03:13.819 --> 03:15.362
I don't actually own anything.

03:15.529 --> 03:16.655
But for a few months,

03:16.822 --> 03:19.158
I could pretend to be dealing
with the decorator

03:19.324 --> 03:21.785
or waiting for the wall hangings
to get out of Syria.

03:21.869 --> 03:23.328
These sanctions are killing me.

03:23.495 --> 03:24.746
But you're doing construction?

03:24.913 --> 03:25.998
No.

03:26.165 --> 03:29.710
That's to make it look like this...

03:29.877 --> 03:31.837
goes on for another 5,000 square feet.

03:31.920 --> 03:34.548
Whoa. Is that an air mattress?

03:34.631 --> 03:36.133
To complete the illusion,

03:36.299 --> 03:37.467
the Mondrian,

03:37.634 --> 03:39.803
those Philippe Starck ghost chairs...

03:41.221 --> 03:42.848
This antique Savonnerie.

03:43.015 --> 03:45.184
No. Bad dog!

03:45.266 --> 03:46.434
Look what you've done!

03:46.601 --> 03:48.395
Bad dog!

03:49.021 --> 03:50.064
Oh, it's okay.

03:50.189 --> 03:51.429
It's just a little bit of dirt.

03:51.481 --> 03:53.108
This rug cost $30,000.

03:53.274 --> 03:55.736
Oh! I'm sorry, rug.

03:56.737 --> 03:58.279
Speaking of money, Ms. White,

03:58.446 --> 04:00.615
do you think maybe you could
start paying me again?

04:00.782 --> 04:02.910
Pay you? No, Kimmy.

04:03.077 --> 04:04.953
We're just friends helping each other.

04:05.037 --> 04:06.080
I'll go first.

04:06.163 --> 04:07.831
Stop sleeping on that side of your face.

04:07.998 --> 04:09.208
Now you go.

04:10.458 --> 04:12.753
Well, I picked up all your old mail.

04:12.836 --> 04:15.380
I missed a shift at the Christmas store
waiting in line.

04:15.547 --> 04:18.091
Did you know the post office
is only open 40 minutes a week?

04:18.257 --> 04:19.466
Mm.

04:19.634 --> 04:21.762
<i>Blimp Aficionado.</i>

04:21.928 --> 04:24.098
Oh, how nice.

04:24.181 --> 04:27.184
A wedding invitation
from the Van Rensselaer twins.

04:27.350 --> 04:29.110
Oh, are they getting married
on the same day?

04:29.269 --> 04:30.789
Actually, they're marrying each other.

04:30.938 --> 04:33.815
It's disgusting,
but it keeps the money in the family,

04:33.899 --> 04:35.859
and they're so in love.

04:37.360 --> 04:39.738
Oh, it's tomorrow?

04:39.821 --> 04:40.948
Send my regrets.

04:41.031 --> 04:42.383
I can't go to that without a date.

04:42.407 --> 04:44.659
Yeah, you're gonna be dating again.

04:44.743 --> 04:46.221
And we'll get to have breakfast lunches

04:46.245 --> 04:49.330
where we talk about boys,
'cause that's what friends do.

04:49.414 --> 04:50.665
Can we get table fries?

04:50.832 --> 04:51.875
That reminds me.

04:51.959 --> 04:53.919
Kimmy, can you be a friend
and run back home?

04:54.002 --> 04:56.046
I think I left my fake eyelashes
in your bathroom.

04:56.213 --> 04:57.839
Wait. So those weren't spiders?

04:57.923 --> 04:59.549
Then what was biting me?

05:00.634 --> 05:02.343
All the other bugs.

05:08.850 --> 05:10.351
How's the one-man show coming?

05:10.435 --> 05:11.955
Are you up to the part
where you meet me?

05:11.979 --> 05:12.813

05:12.896 --> 05:15.482
<i>♪ Who's that Kimmy

05:15.565 --> 05:17.901
<i>♪ Eatin' pickle chicken

05:18.068 --> 05:19.987
No, I'm not doing that show anymore.

05:20.070 --> 05:21.947
What? You're giving up already?

05:22.114 --> 05:24.658
I realized the one-man show
about my life has been done.

05:24.825 --> 05:26.493
Small-town boy moves to the big city

05:26.660 --> 05:28.380
to come out of the closet
and become a star?

05:28.453 --> 05:30.705
That describes literally everyone I know:

05:30.872 --> 05:33.416
Rick from work, my old trick Fabian,

05:33.500 --> 05:35.210
even the man
whose name I will not mention,

05:35.294 --> 05:36.295
Coriolanus Burt.

05:36.377 --> 05:37.378
Damn it.

05:39.089 --> 05:40.548
Touchdown!

05:40.632 --> 05:42.050
Ha-ha!

05:42.717 --> 05:45.304
But the only score I really cared about

05:45.386 --> 05:47.014
was the score...

So what? Yours will be better.

06:04.572 --> 06:05.572
It certainly will,

06:05.615 --> 06:07.534
because I'm still doing a show
about myself,

06:07.617 --> 06:09.911
just not this myself.

06:10.078 --> 06:14.166
Oh... now I'm confused.

06:14.333 --> 06:17.961
As you know, I vividly remember
all my past lives.

06:18.128 --> 06:20.964
There's Cyrus, the first openly gay slave.

06:21.131 --> 06:24.051
Alphonse, who almost invented the raisin.

06:24.218 --> 06:27.762
And Napoleon, a very sick parrot.

06:27.929 --> 06:30.431
- No pug dogs?
- For the last time, no!

06:31.725 --> 06:33.227
But none of my past selves

06:33.310 --> 06:35.812
were more talented or more troubled

06:35.896 --> 06:38.815
than the Japanese geisha Murasaki.

06:38.982 --> 06:41.235
You're playing a Japanese woman?

06:41.400 --> 06:43.778
Playing? I <i>was </i> a Japanese woman.

06:43.945 --> 06:47.991
Well, if Aisha Tyler
can play a white woman on <i>Friends,</i>

06:48.075 --> 06:49.159
then I guess it's okay.

06:49.284 --> 06:52.037
Ooh, can you come tomorrow night?

06:52.120 --> 06:53.388
I'm gonna start workshopping it.

06:53.412 --> 06:55.374
Wow, I'll be in the front row.

06:55.456 --> 06:57.042
Should I bring a tarp? Will I get wet?

06:57.209 --> 06:58.543
Probably. I'm a sweater.

06:59.836 --> 07:02.672
Now I just need to get posters printed
and buy a new kimono.

07:02.839 --> 07:04.275
What's wrong with all your other kimonos?

07:04.299 --> 07:06.277
A person can outgrow a kimono.
It happens all the time.

07:06.301 --> 07:08.387
They don't fit anymore.
You happy now?

07:13.350 --> 07:15.060
Bad dog. Bad!

07:16.603 --> 07:19.898
Can you schedule Abattoir
a massage for tomorrow?

07:20.065 --> 07:22.150
Really? So you can spend money
on stuff like that?

07:22.317 --> 07:25.612
I told you.
It's all about appearances right now.

07:25.695 --> 07:28.156
If I walk around the city
with a stressed-out dog,

07:28.240 --> 07:29.283
people are gonna talk.

07:29.449 --> 07:32.577
I mean, look at him. He's a wreck.

07:36.706 --> 07:38.499
It's a disaster!

07:38.666 --> 07:42.170
Mimi Kanassis, no shoes on the rug!

07:42.337 --> 07:43.713
How did you get in here?

07:43.797 --> 07:45.077
Who told you where I was living?

07:45.132 --> 07:47.217
My Adderall dealer
goes to school with Buckley.

07:47.384 --> 07:48.504
Then I showed up downstairs,

07:48.593 --> 07:50.262
flashed my pearly whites at the doorman,

07:50.345 --> 07:52.847
and here I am because of the news.

07:53.890 --> 07:55.767
That son of a bitch.

07:55.934 --> 07:56.934
How could Julian do this?

07:56.977 --> 07:59.146
I know. Going public so soon?

07:59.229 --> 08:01.648
This is exactly what Stanley did to me.

08:01.815 --> 08:03.817
Jacqueline, we're the same.

08:03.900 --> 08:05.402
Closer than sisters.

08:05.568 --> 08:06.861
Is he just trying to hurt me?

08:07.028 --> 08:08.822
- Ms. White, I'm sorry.
- Oh!

08:08.905 --> 08:10.466
Oh, I thought you were
a Jeff Koons sculpture

08:10.490 --> 08:11.950
of Ronald McDonald.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.619
This is so humiliating.

08:14.702 --> 08:16.496
Oh, I know. You'll get used to it.

08:16.579 --> 08:17.914
- I did.
- No.

08:17.998 --> 08:20.334
I'm gonna find a date
and go to that wedding tomorrow,

08:20.417 --> 08:22.877
show everyone how great I'm doing.

08:22.961 --> 08:24.754
And it'll be someone
even richer than Julian.

08:24.921 --> 08:27.548
Well, maybe this new guy
has a weird brother for me.

08:27.632 --> 08:30.260
Wait, so you just want to go back
to being arm candy

08:30.344 --> 08:32.179
for some old Richie Rich?

08:32.261 --> 08:35.849
Ms. White, you worked so hard
to get away from all that.

08:36.015 --> 08:37.225
I'm not letting you do this.

08:37.392 --> 08:38.558
Try and stop us!

08:38.643 --> 08:40.602
No, please don't. I need this so bad.

08:40.687 --> 08:42.313
Pull yourself together, Kanassis.

08:42.397 --> 08:44.316
We're going out tonight,
and you're my wingman.

08:44.483 --> 08:46.360
Yes! Turtle gets his!

08:54.075 --> 08:55.743
Hey, hey!

08:55.910 --> 08:58.913
Yo, B, who's F-10-5?

08:59.080 --> 09:00.332
Never heard of them.

09:00.415 --> 09:02.135
They one of those Tejano gangs
or something?

09:02.292 --> 09:03.584
Of course!

09:03.668 --> 09:05.462
Effé-ten-cinco.

09:05.545 --> 09:07.172
Oh, I think I heard of them.

09:07.339 --> 09:08.798
Hey...

09:08.965 --> 09:11.968
maybe there'll be a gang war.

09:12.052 --> 09:13.512
Someone gets shot.

09:13.594 --> 09:15.763
We paint them on the wall.

09:15.847 --> 09:18.433
But maybe they're not really dead.

09:18.517 --> 09:21.186
We keep releasing albums...

09:22.187 --> 09:24.814
One step at a time, Lillian.

09:24.898 --> 09:26.441
One step at a time.

09:34.115 --> 09:35.283
Time to get more Ds

09:35.367 --> 09:37.869
than a kid with undiagnosed dyslexia.

09:40.663 --> 09:42.874
Mm, everyone's looking at me.

09:45.335 --> 09:47.212
Tucker Cobblepot,

09:47.295 --> 09:49.256
how do you keep getting younger?

09:49.339 --> 09:51.425
Oh, I did that thing Trump did,

09:51.591 --> 09:53.009
where they gather your head skin up

09:53.093 --> 09:55.595
and tie it in a knot
on the top of your skull

09:55.678 --> 09:58.557
and then cut new face holes
in what used to be your neck.

09:58.723 --> 10:01.184
It's working.

10:04.062 --> 10:05.688
Ah-ha-ha-ha!

10:05.855 --> 10:08.442
I see you met my grandmother.

10:08.608 --> 10:10.860
Oh. Mmm.

10:10.944 --> 10:12.446
Mmm...

10:12.529 --> 10:15.449
Mmm. Onion.

10:17.658 --> 10:19.077
What are you doing here?

10:19.160 --> 10:20.495
I hid in the trunk of your taxi,

10:20.579 --> 10:21.859
and I'm not letting you do this.

10:21.913 --> 10:23.457
Where were we?

10:23.623 --> 10:25.041
Oh-ho-ho, right.

10:25.208 --> 10:27.461
You were about to kiss me
with your dental slit.

10:27.627 --> 10:30.027
No, no, no, believe me, Jacqueline,
I'd love to, but I can't.

10:30.130 --> 10:31.881
I don't understand.

10:32.048 --> 10:34.884
Julian and I are partners in a deal
to frack in Central Park.

10:35.051 --> 10:37.929
And it's not just me.
We all do business with Julian Voorhees.

10:38.096 --> 10:41.141
You are strictly off-limits.

10:44.311 --> 10:46.191
Well, then how am I supposed
to get back at him?

10:46.354 --> 10:48.106
I don't know.
Kill yourself in his office?

10:48.189 --> 10:49.441
I always hate that.

10:53.570 --> 10:56.197
I didn't even know I was into this.

10:56.364 --> 10:57.532
Ugh!

11:01.578 --> 11:02.662
Sloppy thirds.

11:04.205 --> 11:05.706
Ms. White.

11:06.833 --> 11:07.875
I'm sorry,

11:07.959 --> 11:10.086
but maybe this isn't such a bad thing.

11:10.253 --> 11:11.630
Are you kidding?

11:11.712 --> 11:13.214
I've been cut off.

11:13.381 --> 11:16.551
My only options now
are tech nerds or Bobby Flay.

11:16.717 --> 11:18.052
Don't ever say that.

11:18.219 --> 11:20.138
Gosh, just forget about money.

11:20.305 --> 11:23.517
You should be looking for the opposite
of Mr. Voorhees...

11:23.682 --> 11:27.395
A good guy who's faithful and honest

11:27.479 --> 11:29.439
and has blond hair

11:29.523 --> 11:32.400
and his hands
are where his feet should be.

11:32.484 --> 11:35.362
Kimmy, you know what would
cheer me up right now?

11:36.446 --> 11:38.031
If you looked ugly.

11:41.201 --> 11:42.410
Thank you.

11:54.881 --> 11:57.162
Now to find someplace
to buy a proper costume for tonight.

11:57.258 --> 12:00.387
"Kimono. New York.

12:00.554 --> 12:02.013
Costume.

12:02.180 --> 12:04.349
Husky."

12:04.516 --> 12:06.601
My show is on the Internet,

12:06.767 --> 12:09.437
where Beyoncé
and the president live.

12:09.521 --> 12:11.439
That poster at the poster store was right,

12:11.523 --> 12:13.400
nothing's more effective than a poster.

12:13.567 --> 12:14.775
Shh.

12:17.904 --> 12:20.114
I wonder what computer owners
are saying about me.

12:22.367 --> 12:24.160
"A forum to advocate

12:24.244 --> 12:26.829
Respectful Asian Portrayals
in Entertainment."

12:26.996 --> 12:29.666
- Shh!
- Fine.

12:29.748 --> 12:31.251
I will take a silent face journey

12:31.334 --> 12:34.045
as I scroll through this comments section.

12:54.982 --> 12:56.067
Good morning.

12:56.234 --> 12:58.653
Welcome to Yappy Endings Dog Spa.

12:58.819 --> 12:59.904
What happened to Savannah?

13:00.071 --> 13:01.197
Oh, no one knows.

13:01.364 --> 13:02.449
I'm Douglas,

13:02.532 --> 13:03.991
and I know exactly who you are.

13:04.158 --> 13:06.703
May I say,
you look even younger than you did

13:06.785 --> 13:08.955
on the cover of
<i>HAMPTONS </i> magazine last year.

13:09.122 --> 13:12.208
I do that skin therapy
where you put on a helmet full of bees.

13:12.375 --> 13:14.711
It's working.

13:16.421 --> 13:19.966
Anyway, this is my dog-a-poo, Abattoir.

13:20.133 --> 13:22.051
This is Abattoir?

13:22.135 --> 13:23.637
I thought you two were sisters.

13:25.972 --> 13:28.224
- Stop.
- Oh...

13:33.104 --> 13:34.355
Ooh.

13:37.525 --> 13:39.152
They called you a Hitler?

13:39.319 --> 13:41.655
They named me one of their
top five Hitlers of all time.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.740
Real Hitler wasn't even on the list!

13:43.906 --> 13:45.908
Why am I not allowed to be Murasaki?

13:45.992 --> 13:47.744
I-she am-was me-her.

13:47.910 --> 13:49.996
Titus, those guys are a bunch of hosers.

13:50.079 --> 13:52.373
How can they criticize something
they haven't even seen?

13:52.540 --> 13:54.041
'Cause that's what the Internet is...

13:54.125 --> 13:56.586
just anonymous hosers
criticizing geniuses.

13:56.670 --> 13:59.005
This is all your fault!
You made me do this!

13:59.172 --> 14:01.567
Well, I'm gonna talk to the Internet
and make it apologize, okay?

14:01.591 --> 14:03.593
Anonymous insults like that
are never cool...

14:03.760 --> 14:06.680
except when you write "wash me"
on a dirty car.

14:06.763 --> 14:10.266
That's just funny,
'cause, like, is it the car saying it?

14:15.313 --> 14:16.439
Hey.

14:19.984 --> 14:22.821
Hey. You see that?

14:22.903 --> 14:27.200
This is Effé-ten-cinco territory, <i>putas!</i>

14:27.283 --> 14:28.451
Yeah!

14:30.537 --> 14:33.456
Oh, yeah, you... You better keep drivin'.

14:33.540 --> 14:36.000
Effé-ten-cinco, bacon!

14:37.669 --> 14:39.212
Run, Lillian!

14:39.838 --> 14:41.255
Oh, goodness.

14:42.298 --> 14:44.843
Oh, Kimmy, I'm glad you're here.

14:44.925 --> 14:46.594
See? I took your advice.

14:46.761 --> 14:49.055
I went out and found
the opposite of Julian,

14:49.222 --> 14:50.724
just like you said.

14:50.890 --> 14:53.017
Look at how young and poor he is.

14:53.184 --> 14:56.020
His name is Douglas,
and he's coasting on looks.

14:56.103 --> 14:57.146
YOLO!

14:57.230 --> 14:59.399
How is this what I told you to do?

14:59.566 --> 15:01.693
I'm a sugar mommy,
and he's my trophy boy.

15:01.776 --> 15:02.902
Opposite.

15:05.279 --> 15:07.907
You were so smart.

15:07.990 --> 15:10.785
Another rich guy would've made it look
like I needed money.

15:10.951 --> 15:14.080
With Doug on my arm,
I'm the rich and powerful one.

15:14.163 --> 15:16.123
Imagine how mad Julian will be.

15:16.290 --> 15:18.167
That's not the opposite of Julian.

15:18.334 --> 15:19.711
You just switched places with him.

15:19.878 --> 15:20.920
You're Julian now.

15:21.087 --> 15:22.797
That's ridiculous.

15:22.881 --> 15:25.884
I'm helping him with his...
What was it?

15:26.050 --> 15:27.093
Uh, DJ career.

15:28.094 --> 15:29.345
Uh-huh.

15:29.512 --> 15:31.723
Like how Julian helped you
publish that cookbook?

15:31.806 --> 15:35.017
Hey, I'm the one who found the cookbook
mine was based on.

15:35.184 --> 15:36.394
I can't believe you.

15:36.561 --> 15:40.774
Your ex-husband treated you like a thing,
not a person.

15:40.857 --> 15:42.400
You might as well have been his dog.

15:42.567 --> 15:45.612
And now you're doing the same thing
with this poor guy.

15:45.779 --> 15:48.322
Lookit, I've been working my tail off
for you for free

15:48.489 --> 15:52.786
while you've been off buying tuxedos
and invisible chairs.

15:52.869 --> 15:54.328
But you don't deserve my help.

16:00.543 --> 16:02.503
I thought you two were sisters.

16:07.717 --> 16:08.760
What's happening?

16:08.843 --> 16:09.886
I don't know!

16:09.969 --> 16:12.049
I'm just really excited
'cause I did something great.

16:12.096 --> 16:13.431
Look.

16:13.514 --> 16:15.391
Oh, my sweet, fancy Jesus.

16:15.558 --> 16:17.602
I'm a star. You're all dead to me.

16:17.769 --> 16:19.089
And guess who's coming to see it.

16:19.145 --> 16:21.105
Patti LuPone? Patti LaBelle?

16:21.188 --> 16:22.315
I'm out of Pattis.

16:22.398 --> 16:24.000
Does it have to be a Patti,
or did I do that?

16:24.024 --> 16:26.264
Even better. Remember the people
who called you a Hitler?

16:26.319 --> 16:28.362
Well, I mentioned your workshop to them...

16:28.529 --> 16:31.073
No, no, no, it's great.
They apologized.

16:31.157 --> 16:32.450
I told them all about you,

16:32.533 --> 16:36.704
and the webchat moderator himself,
Masuta69, typed,

16:36.788 --> 16:37.872
"I'm so sorry.

16:37.956 --> 16:39.540
We really care that he's your friend.

16:39.624 --> 16:41.041
Could you guys be any cooler?"

16:41.876 --> 16:43.419
Oh, no, Kimmy.

16:43.503 --> 16:45.588
The Internet doesn't talk like that.

16:45.672 --> 16:47.423
The Internet talks like Chandler.

16:47.507 --> 16:49.300
What? No.

16:49.383 --> 16:51.260
"I'm <i>so </i> sorry.

16:51.344 --> 16:53.429
We <i>really </i> care that he's your friend.

16:53.513 --> 16:55.890
Could you guys <i>be </i> any cooler?"

16:55.974 --> 16:58.034
You can't tell when someone's
being sarcastic on the Internet!

16:59.268 --> 17:00.353
There he is!

17:01.896 --> 17:02.981
Masuta69?

17:03.815 --> 17:04.858
What is this?

17:04.941 --> 17:06.776
I mean, do you think
I'm an Einstein or not?

17:06.943 --> 17:08.694
You must be KimmysRadScreenName.

17:08.862 --> 17:10.069
I didn't think you were real.

17:10.154 --> 17:11.364
I assumed you were just him

17:11.446 --> 17:13.090
pretending to be a white girl
who couldn't spell.

17:13.115 --> 17:15.409
Oh, God, this is my audience.

17:15.576 --> 17:17.203
This show is an abomination.

17:17.369 --> 17:19.890
We're gonna boo you so loud,
you won't be able to hear yourself talk.

17:19.914 --> 17:21.875
Yeah, the whole portrayal is offensive.

17:21.958 --> 17:24.002
A geisha? Seriously?

17:24.167 --> 17:25.502
But Murasaki really <i>was </i> a geisha.

17:25.586 --> 17:26.628
Typical.

17:26.796 --> 17:28.565
Why couldn't she be
a successful businesswoman

17:28.589 --> 17:29.632
or a college professor

17:29.716 --> 17:31.300
or a stay-at-home dad?

17:31.467 --> 17:33.427
But if you actually watch the whole show...

17:33.594 --> 17:35.972
I don't want to hear the end
of anything anyone has to say.

17:36.138 --> 17:38.766
But this is about a past life
that I actually lived.

17:38.850 --> 17:40.142
I was Murasaki.

17:40.309 --> 17:42.562
Past lives? That's idiotic.

17:42.645 --> 17:44.898
Oh, so past lives are idiotic?

17:45.023 --> 17:47.859
Hindus are just as much
a part of this organization as anyone,

17:48.026 --> 17:49.819
probably more than this white guy!

17:49.903 --> 17:51.988
I'm transracial, you dumb dick.

17:52.154 --> 17:54.198
- Wow.
- Oh, God!

17:54.365 --> 17:56.534
They drew
a Michael Jordan mustache on me.

17:56.701 --> 17:58.536
Why?

18:03.791 --> 18:05.793
Hey, we should talk, <i>esé.</i>

18:05.960 --> 18:09.923
Maybe I could broker a truce
with the Banana Boys.

18:10.089 --> 18:12.717
Or maybe I set them up.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.719
You know, "Come to this thing,"

18:14.802 --> 18:16.429
but you're there waiting.

18:16.596 --> 18:18.472
Kapowy, kapowy, kapowy.

18:18.556 --> 18:19.807
I work for you.

18:19.891 --> 18:22.226
Lady, I just work for the phone company.

18:22.393 --> 18:24.353
But what about your tag?

18:24.437 --> 18:26.022
Effé-ten-cinco.

18:26.188 --> 18:28.441
This says "FiOS."

18:28.524 --> 18:29.734
It's high-speed Internet.

18:29.901 --> 18:33.029
We're wiring this whole neighborhood
before they put up the new development.

18:33.195 --> 18:35.031
What?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.532
No.

18:36.616 --> 18:39.035
You can't do this to my home.

18:39.118 --> 18:42.872
Hey, hey, <i>Sesame Street</i>
was based on this neighborhood.

18:43.039 --> 18:45.917
'Cause there's a guy
who lives in a garbage can,

18:46.084 --> 18:49.253
and there's a gigantic furry monster

18:49.336 --> 18:51.297
that only I can see.

18:51.380 --> 18:52.580
I don't know what to tell you.

18:52.632 --> 18:54.801
That's progress.

19:03.768 --> 19:05.478
Well, why didn't you eat him?

19:07.605 --> 19:10.149
Doug, what do you think?

19:10.316 --> 19:12.693
Conflict or no conflict?

19:12.860 --> 19:15.237
Whatever, baby.
You always look wicky-wicky amazing...

19:15.404 --> 19:17.573
No!

19:17.740 --> 19:19.241
Look what you did!

19:20.910 --> 19:22.244
Bad Doug!

19:22.411 --> 19:24.122
I can't return it now.

19:24.288 --> 19:25.581
Sorry, but you're so rich.

19:25.748 --> 19:28.334
No. Bad Doug.

19:28.501 --> 19:31.045
No! Bad dog!

19:31.129 --> 19:32.546
Bad Doug!

19:33.464 --> 19:35.257
Oh, God.

19:37.760 --> 19:39.804
Kimmy was right.

19:39.887 --> 19:42.222
I'm no better than Julian.

19:42.306 --> 19:44.433
You're not a dog, Douglas.

19:44.600 --> 19:45.977
I'm whatever you want me to be.

19:46.144 --> 19:47.687
That's the deal, right?

19:48.813 --> 19:51.858
Everything the Power does,
it does in a circle.

19:55.153 --> 19:56.236
I was like you once,

19:56.320 --> 19:58.031
and I wish I had been treated better.

19:58.197 --> 19:59.907
You're a human being

19:59.991 --> 20:03.077
with a dream of being a stand-up comedian.

20:03.243 --> 20:05.287
- DJ.
- Ugh. Still?

20:06.288 --> 20:09.500
The point is, you deserve more than this.

20:09.667 --> 20:11.127
Go follow your dream.

20:11.210 --> 20:14.047
Go hold your hands just above a laptop

20:14.130 --> 20:15.255
while people dance.

20:15.422 --> 20:16.841
But what about the wedding?

20:21.387 --> 20:23.764
Do you know
what the real opposite of Julian is?

20:23.931 --> 20:25.408
I don't know... like, a guy with feet

20:25.432 --> 20:26.517
where his hands should be?

20:26.684 --> 20:30.270
It's respecting people, including myself.

20:31.522 --> 20:35.943
The opposite of Julian is me
going to that wedding on my own.

20:36.110 --> 20:37.528
Wow.

20:37.611 --> 20:38.779
I'm proud of you, Jacqueline.

20:38.946 --> 20:40.823
'Cause the dopest beat...

20:42.449 --> 20:43.617
is in here.

20:43.784 --> 20:45.369
Get out of my home.

20:50.917 --> 20:52.877
I'm so sorry, Titus.

20:52.960 --> 20:54.336
This is my fault.

20:54.503 --> 20:56.732
I understand if you don't want
to go through with the show.

20:56.756 --> 20:58.632
All that walking here for nothing.

20:58.799 --> 21:00.134
Ugh!

21:00.218 --> 21:02.636
The Internet is ruining everything.

21:02.803 --> 21:04.781
- Tell me about it.
- It's just a bunch of Chandlers.

21:04.805 --> 21:06.557
What's the point of any of it?

21:06.724 --> 21:08.976
I mean, there's no fighting the man.

21:09.060 --> 21:10.477
We should just give up.

21:10.644 --> 21:13.355
You're right. I should just give up.

21:15.691 --> 21:18.152
You are talented, Murasaki,

21:18.236 --> 21:21.363
but you will never fit in here.

21:21.530 --> 21:23.116
You're right.

21:24.658 --> 21:27.286
I should just give up.

21:28.788 --> 21:31.331
Look, Cyrus, you got to cool it
with the gay rights stuff.

21:31.498 --> 21:33.709
We got way bigger problems
down here, man.

21:33.876 --> 21:35.169
You're right.

21:35.253 --> 21:37.379
I should just give up.

21:37.463 --> 21:38.923
Alphonse...

21:39.090 --> 21:42.260
your grapes are getting ruined
out there in the sun!

21:42.426 --> 21:44.137
You're right.

21:44.220 --> 21:46.388
I should just give up.

21:48.182 --> 21:49.683
You? Ride after fox?!

21:49.850 --> 21:51.602
Don't be ridiculous, Argos!

21:51.769 --> 21:53.980
You're right. I should just give up.

21:56.023 --> 21:57.108
No.

21:58.358 --> 21:59.986
I'm done listening to haters.

22:02.071 --> 22:04.231
I've been giving up on my dreams
for hundreds of years.

22:04.364 --> 22:06.159
It ends now.

22:09.620 --> 22:10.740
Mega Hitler! Mega...

22:10.871 --> 22:12.331
Oh, you're gonna boo?

22:12.414 --> 22:13.457
Well, I boo you!

22:13.540 --> 22:16.794
Boo! Boo!

22:16.961 --> 22:19.379
Dear, you're just adding to the booing.

22:20.923 --> 22:24.302
My first memory is the willow tree.

but they look right through me.

23:18.605 --> 23:20.358
You said you'd take me with you.

23:21.525 --> 23:23.319
I cannot stay here.

23:23.401 --> 23:24.444
I'm pregnant.

23:28.241 --> 23:29.783
So I packed my kimono...

23:32.953 --> 23:34.788
My precious books.

23:34.955 --> 23:36.916
And I returned to my village

23:36.999 --> 23:40.044
to sing... no more.

Bravo!

24:20.000 --> 24:21.168
Titus.

24:24.171 --> 24:25.631
You inspired me.

24:25.798 --> 24:27.300
I'm not giving up.

24:27.465 --> 24:29.969
They're gonna make this neighborhood nicer

24:30.052 --> 24:32.179
over my dead body!

24:32.346 --> 24:36.100
Or at least a body
that sure looks a lot like me

24:36.183 --> 24:38.644
but is burned beyond recognition.

24:40.020 --> 24:43.816
Titus, if anything deserves a high five,
it's this.

24:43.983 --> 24:45.025
And yet nothing does.

24:46.526 --> 24:47.987
That was beautiful.

24:49.655 --> 24:51.657
I haven't heard that song
since I was a little boy.

24:51.824 --> 24:55.119
Corbin, what do we do
now that we're not offended?

24:55.286 --> 24:56.329
Yeah, I feel weird.

24:56.494 --> 24:59.415
It's like... I can't breathe.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.792
Wait, I'm not allowed to say that.

25:02.709 --> 25:05.545
I offended myself.

25:08.506 --> 25:09.633
Yo, yo, yo, bitches,

25:09.716 --> 25:10.884
where my table at?

25:11.051 --> 25:12.094
What are you doing here?

25:12.178 --> 25:13.405
Why aren't you with Jacqueline?

25:13.429 --> 25:14.721
She set me free.

25:14.805 --> 25:17.016
She said I could be
so much more than a trophy boy,

25:17.099 --> 25:18.184
and she was right.

25:18.351 --> 25:20.602
So say goodbye to Douglas,

25:20.769 --> 25:23.105
and say hello to DJ FingaBlazt.

25:27.026 --> 25:29.111
Jacqueline listened to me.

25:38.204 --> 25:39.288
Oh, Jacqueline.

25:39.455 --> 25:42.916
Don't tell me you're making your debut
sans peen.

25:44.251 --> 25:45.711
Mimi, darling.

25:45.794 --> 25:49.423
How did that sad woman guess my name?

25:49.589 --> 25:52.718
Away, gypsy. No babies for you here.

25:55.553 --> 25:56.638
You know what?

25:57.806 --> 26:00.476
I don't care what any of you think.

26:00.558 --> 26:02.353
I know who I am.

26:02.436 --> 26:03.729
I don't need a man.

26:03.896 --> 26:05.231
Scoff.

26:08.484 --> 26:10.277
- Kimmy attack!
- What's happening?

26:10.444 --> 26:12.238
Oh, good. It's you this time.

26:12.405 --> 26:14.365
There's a lot of fancy blond ladies here.

26:15.573 --> 26:17.326
I saw Douglas. I know what you did.

26:17.493 --> 26:20.162
I just had to come down here
and give you a high five.

26:20.329 --> 26:22.748
Absolutely not. But thank you, Kimmy.

26:22.831 --> 26:23.957
I just...

26:24.041 --> 26:25.435
I don't think I can go through with this.

26:25.459 --> 26:26.668
They all think I'm a joke.

26:26.835 --> 26:28.421
So let them laugh

26:28.586 --> 26:30.297
and laugh and laugh

26:30.381 --> 26:32.132
and dance and laugh,

26:32.216 --> 26:35.761
'cause we don't care
what everyone you know thinks.

26:38.222 --> 26:40.766
Nope. Titus almost gave in
to the haters today.

26:40.849 --> 26:41.934
And I almost let him.

26:42.017 --> 26:43.245
But I'm not making that mistake again.

26:43.269 --> 26:45.438
Well, what have we here?

26:45.603 --> 26:47.022
Don't need a man, indeed.

26:47.106 --> 26:50.317
Jacqueline, why,
don't tell me this is your date.

26:51.693 --> 26:53.237
Date? Mr. Splode...

26:53.320 --> 26:56.323
Yes, well, it's nothing serious.

26:56.490 --> 26:59.826
I just had to take a break from men
after Julian.

26:59.910 --> 27:02.246
I guess some people
might find that fascinating.

27:02.413 --> 27:04.622
<i>Le freak c'est chic.</i>

27:04.706 --> 27:07.293
And such a nasty little butch boy.

27:07.460 --> 27:10.129
She's a model for L.L.Bean's
performance fleeces.

27:10.212 --> 27:11.338
Scrumptious!

27:11.505 --> 27:12.965
You're the belle of the ball.

27:13.048 --> 27:14.383
Julian will be furious

27:14.467 --> 27:16.385
when he hears about this
from someone who is me.

27:16.552 --> 27:18.636
Jacqueline's my best friend.

27:20.180 --> 27:21.765
Congratulations!

27:23.767 --> 27:26.353
A chocolate fountain?

27:26.437 --> 27:28.772
How much drinks can you drink from it?

27:36.280 --> 27:37.573
We miss you, Biggie.

27:37.739 --> 27:40.200
Your name described your spirit

27:40.367 --> 27:43.412
as well as your morbid obesity.

27:43.579 --> 27:45.331
It looks just like him.

27:45.498 --> 27:47.333
You know, B,

27:47.500 --> 27:50.252
I also do nudes.

27:52.879 --> 27:54.079
- Run, Lillian!
- Run, Lillian!

29:07.204 --> 29:09.164
- Good night, everybody!
- Good night!
