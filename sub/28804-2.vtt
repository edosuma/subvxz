27:40.873 --> 27:44.456
Every month, 12 amateurs,
big shot wannabes,

27:44.539 --> 27:47.164
play poker upstairs
in his back room.

27:47.247 --> 27:48.665
What kind of score
we talking about?

27:48.748 --> 27:51.997
Anywhere between 250
and 300 grand in the safe.

27:52.081 --> 27:54.414
-What kind of security?
-There's a doorman,

27:54.498 --> 27:57.498
three guys on the floor,
cameras, local alarm company.

27:57.581 --> 27:58.997
You know if they call
first to check in?

27:59.081 --> 28:01.831
Verified response. They call
Joe to make sure it's real,

28:01.915 --> 28:04.122
and then it takes them about
five minutes to get there,

28:04.206 --> 28:05.498
then they call
in the cops.

28:05.581 --> 28:06.997
-How many exits?
-Two.

28:07.081 --> 28:08.414
How many patrons in the club?

28:08.498 --> 28:11.748
Anywhere between 80 to 100,
between 11:00 to midnight.

28:12.997 --> 28:14.414
I don't like it.

28:16.997 --> 28:18.581
Let's take a break.

28:22.414 --> 28:23.581

28:28.289 --> 28:31.456
Miljan Bestic isn't
asking for your opinion.

28:31.539 --> 28:33.414
He needs this done.

28:34.247 --> 28:36.581
Lynnville is 40 minutes
from my house.

28:36.665 --> 28:38.164
So what?

28:38.247 --> 28:40.456
I don't do any job
that close to home.

28:41.289 --> 28:45.122
Look. I realize we got off
on the wrong foot here,

28:45.206 --> 28:46.956
but I'm not interested
in your rules.

28:47.039 --> 28:48.373
I'm interested
in your leadership.

28:48.456 --> 28:50.915

and a driver in there.

28:50.997 --> 28:52.706
We need you
to come up with the plan.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.831
You got a week
to set it up.

28:54.915 --> 28:57.623
You expect me to believe
we're doing this for 250?

28:57.706 --> 28:59.873
I don't give a shit
what you believe.

28:59.956 --> 29:02.122
Now, you walk back in there,

29:02.206 --> 29:04.456

a plan together.

-Bit of a loner.
-What's he into?
Golf, guns, what?

29:19.289 --> 29:21.665
He likes girls.

29:23.456 --> 29:25.623
What are you thinking?

29:26.498 --> 29:28.331
Since we need to handle
the alarm company,

29:28.414 --> 29:30.414
on top of the club,
we have no time to dick around

29:30.498 --> 29:32.956
with the safe, so we'll
need inside assistance.

29:33.039 --> 29:34.539
Let's get a girl
to distract him.

29:34.623 --> 29:37.206
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing.

29:37.289 --> 29:39.539
You look like a pretty
good distraction to me,

29:39.623 --> 29:41.247
or am I outta line?

we'll get a girl

30:08.623 --> 30:11.373
Here is the Earth Day
Jubilee drawing.

30:14.414 --> 30:17.831
In your note, you said you
had some concerns about Alice?

30:17.915 --> 30:19.289
Not concerns, exactly.

30:19.373 --> 30:21.289
Just we like to get in
touch with the parents

30:21.373 --> 30:23.623
when the children
show signs.

30:23.706 --> 30:24.831
She's very
precocious, Alice.

30:24.915 --> 30:27.373
-Yes.
-And inquisitive.

30:27.456 --> 30:28.790
And she's been
getting into fights

30:28.873 --> 30:30.456
with the other kids
about God.

30:30.539 --> 30:33.790
She says that he punishes
people unfairly.

30:36.081 --> 30:38.039
Alice talks about
Maria being sick?

30:38.122 --> 30:39.665
She's very upset.

30:39.748 --> 30:41.831
Is Maria Alice's other mom?

30:41.915 --> 30:44.498
-No.
-But she raises
Alice with you.

30:44.581 --> 30:48.665
We live with her.
Her terminal condition was
in remission, but it came back.

30:48.748 --> 30:51.247
Oh my God. I-I'm...

30:51.331 --> 30:53.081
That's awful.

30:54.915 --> 30:56.206
This is obviously sensitive,

30:56.289 --> 30:58.081
but does Alice know her father?

30:58.164 --> 30:59.915
No, he died.

31:01.873 --> 31:03.539
Oh, um...

31:04.456 --> 31:06.790
I didn't know, um...

31:06.873 --> 31:09.539
-How?
-Suddenly.

31:13.748 --> 31:15.122
I'll talk to her.

31:15.206 --> 31:18.289
You know, we have a really
good psychologist on staff.

31:18.665 --> 31:20.456
I don't need someone to talk to.

31:20.539 --> 31:22.831
I meant for Alice.

31:23.706 --> 31:24.790
Ah.

31:25.539 --> 31:27.790
She's really special.

31:28.289 --> 31:29.915
I agree.

31:32.456 --> 31:34.623
(rain pattering)

31:54.373 --> 31:56.831
I misunderstood.
Thought it was just you and me.

31:56.956 --> 31:58.831
She's my partner.

31:59.706 --> 32:00.748
What's your problem?

32:00.831 --> 32:02.414
I've seen men
trust women before.

32:02.498 --> 32:03.665
Stop it.

32:05.331 --> 32:07.831
Charlie's going to war
with Jacinto Salas.

32:09.247 --> 32:10.706
Who is he?

32:11.456 --> 32:13.915
Connected
to the Matices cartel.

32:13.997 --> 32:16.665
Been stepping on a lot of
toes since he moved here.

32:16.748 --> 32:17.997
Jett:
Drugs, what?

32:18.081 --> 32:19.873
Import export:
drugs, people.

32:21.081 --> 32:23.873
He killed a judge
on Charlie's payroll.

32:23.956 --> 32:25.665
That would
be Prosky.

32:26.748 --> 32:28.456
It's a fucking mess.

32:29.122 --> 32:30.915
What's he after?

32:31.956 --> 32:34.956
Charlie doesn't carry as much
weight as he did 20 years ago,

32:35.039 --> 32:37.247
but keeps a finger
in a lot of different pies.

32:37.331 --> 32:40.581
The Russians still love him,
and they bring in
a lot of money.

32:40.665 --> 32:42.956
I'd say Salas is out to prove
he can do a better job

32:43.039 --> 32:44.665
at protecting
their interests.

32:44.748 --> 32:48.164
Dumb question. Why don't
you just kill Junior?

32:48.915 --> 32:50.456
What kinda cop is she?

32:50.539 --> 32:52.206
I mean, if it's
strictly revenge,

32:52.289 --> 32:53.706
I don't understand
your play.

32:56.039 --> 32:57.122
Let's do this.

32:57.206 --> 32:59.623
I feed you
information on Junior,

32:59.706 --> 33:01.039
and you put him away.

33:01.122 --> 33:03.373
In return, you don't ask
me anymore dumb questions.

33:03.456 --> 33:05.289
In return,
you play detective,

33:05.373 --> 33:07.039
going after what
you're really after,

33:07.122 --> 33:08.498
keeping us in the dark,

33:08.581 --> 33:10.706
putting us in danger.

33:11.164 --> 33:12.790
You can't expect
us to protect you--

33:12.873 --> 33:14.748
I don't want your protection.

33:14.831 --> 33:16.247
In fact, I ever see,

33:16.331 --> 33:19.164
or even imagine I see,
a car keeping tabs on me,

33:19.247 --> 33:20.498
deal's over.

33:20.581 --> 33:23.498
I can't afford you
putting my kid in danger.

a gun to my head

-Everything go all right?
-Why wouldn't it?

59:29.873 --> 59:31.539
SEBASTIAN GUTIERREZ: Junior
is Charlie Baudelaire's son.

59:31.623 --> 59:36.414
As such, he has grown entitled
and impulsive and unpredictable.

59:36.623 --> 59:38.790
-I don't follow.
-Something happens to me,

59:38.873 --> 59:40.581
a new judge is assigned
to your dad's case

59:40.665 --> 59:42.956
-and he nails him.
-What just happened?

59:43.331 --> 59:44.289
Did something spook you?

59:44.623 --> 59:47.289
Well, I think Jett functions
very much on instinct.

59:47.373 --> 59:50.122
And she's never had
a great impression of Junior.

59:50.206 --> 59:52.331
I think she's always known
he's a wildcard.

59:52.665 --> 59:54.665
-And he's unraveling.
-(ENGINE CHURNS)

59:54.915 --> 59:57.164
-(PHONE BEEPS)
-(EXPLOSION)

59:57.706 --> 1:00:00.247
In episode two, really, Jett
is just trying to get

1:00:00.331 --> 1:00:01.997
as much information as she can.

1:00:02.331 --> 1:00:03.665
Which Baudelaire are you after?

1:00:03.748 --> 1:00:04.831
MAN:
One comes with the other,

1:00:04.915 --> 1:00:06.247
but it's Junior
we're concentrating on.

1:00:06.331 --> 1:00:08.247
GUTIERREZ: It is because of tha
that she does something

1:00:08.331 --> 1:00:10.706
very out of character.
She forms an alliance.

1:00:10.790 --> 1:00:12.956
Charlie's going to war
with Jacinto Salas.

1:00:13.164 --> 1:00:13.997
Who is he?

1:00:14.373 --> 1:00:16.956
While letting him think
she's giving him information,

1:00:17.331 --> 1:00:19.873
she can also have a way
to get information about Junior.

1:00:20.081 --> 1:00:23.665
I ever see or even imagine
I see a car keeping tabs on me,

1:00:23.956 --> 1:00:24.831
deal's over.

1:00:25.331 --> 1:00:27.748
GUTIERREZ: Jett, like most
smart women that I know,

1:00:27.831 --> 1:00:29.498
is a very practical person.

1:00:29.581 --> 1:00:32.665
If she prepares
and rehearses things

1:00:32.748 --> 1:00:34.956
and picks the right people,
she can get the job done.

1:00:35.039 --> 1:00:36.831
But I'm not interested
in your rules.

1:00:36.915 --> 1:00:38.247
I'm interested
in your leadership.

1:00:38.331 --> 1:00:39.706
We need you to come up
with a plan.

1:00:39.873 --> 1:00:41.456
She's never been in a position

1:00:41.539 --> 1:00:43.081
where she's working
for someone else.

1:00:43.456 --> 1:00:45.247
So, I think,
straight off the bat,

1:00:45.539 --> 1:00:47.498
this is very unfamiliar terrain.

1:00:47.706 --> 1:00:50.039
JETT: We're gonna do
without firing any bullets.

1:00:50.122 --> 1:00:51.623
CARLA GUGINO: It's not
that she's a control freak.

1:00:51.706 --> 1:00:54.289
It's really that the outcome
is so much better

1:00:54.373 --> 1:00:57.164
if she can control more of
the steps towards the outcome.

1:00:57.247 --> 1:00:59.456
There's something very fishy
about this job,

1:00:59.539 --> 1:01:01.581
but I think when she finds out
the gold bricks are there,

1:01:01.665 --> 1:01:03.581
it opens a can of worms
in which she did not have

1:01:03.665 --> 1:01:05.956
information about, which is
the part that drives her crazy.

1:01:06.039 --> 1:01:07.039
(GUNSHOT)

1:01:09.498 --> 1:01:11.206
-Sorry, Jett.
-(GUNSHOT)
