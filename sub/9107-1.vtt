I'm exactly what the game needs.
I'm an entertainer.

01:22.600 --> 01:25.319
I'm always conscious of the man
in the street who pays a fiver,

01:25.320 --> 01:28.479

01:28.480 --> 01:30.839
If I can help someone escape that dreary,

Excuse me, Mr Higgins. Mr Higgins!
It's just we do have a dress code.

02:22.440 --> 02:24.479
I know you do, Ted, and
I'd love to wear that,

02:24.480 --> 02:26.879

account of my neck disease.

You do know I have a
neck disease, don't you?

02:29.520 --> 02:33.679
It's the same one that afflicts the
violinists. I have a doctor's note.

02:33.680 --> 02:35.800
Come on in, you can read it for yourself.

I bet he gets sunburnt

05:48.120 --> 05:49.799

He's like Marcel Marceau in a library.

06:00.320 --> 06:03.320
Parlez-vous the English, senorita?

06:06.040 --> 06:09.639
Sorry, Mr Hearn. I did find
your jokes very funny,

06:09.640 --> 06:13.199
but I like to concentrate
when I'm practising.

06:13.200 --> 06:17.199
- Do you want a drink, Davis? It is Steve Davis, isn't it?
- Yes.

06:17.200 --> 06:19.679
Yes, it is, Mr Hearn. That's very kind.
Milk, please.

06:19.680 --> 06:22.520
- Cold milk is fine.
- What, you don't drink?

06:24.040 --> 06:25.479
I like an eggnog.

No, actually, I don't like it.

Now, the trick is, keep
the bottom one still

pinch the food together.

07:46.400 --> 07:47.640

19:22.560 --> 19:27.559

- Good.

Yeah. Look, you're there, all right?

you to make the shot.

20:16.000 --> 20:17.879

you've seen a lot of trauma.

warm milk before bedtime.

20:53.760 --> 20:55.399

- OK.

21:10.360 --> 21:12.279

put it back down again.

- Why?
- I don't know.

21:24.080 --> 21:25.520

just think I'm a wally?

21:29.880 --> 21:32.199
No, Davis, they won't.

21:32.200 --> 21:35.439
They'll think you're a total arsehole.

21:35.440 --> 21:38.519

out, loads of diagrams.

29:12.280 --> 29:15.079
Barry, shouldn't I write my autobiography?

29:15.080 --> 29:16.919
Davis, don't be a wally.

Even your biggest fan won't want
to wade through an entire chapter

29:20.280 --> 29:21.399

29:40.320 --> 29:43.839
Yeah. I know I said ten, but
that was two minutes ago.

29:43.840 --> 29:45.920

No. No, I'm not.

30:51.360 --> 30:55.399
There is only one word to
describe Alex Higgins.

30:55.400 --> 30:57.999
- Obnoxious.
- I think there's a few more than that,

30:58.000 --> 31:01.319
- but that's the one Brian'll put in the autobiography.
- All right.

31:01.320 --> 31:04.679
But if he touches me again, then I'm
not responsible for what I might do.

31:04.680 --> 31:06.959
Well, what will you do?

31:06.960 --> 31:08.480
Probably go home.

31:09.640 --> 31:11.560
All right, I'll sort it.

that is all too commonly forgotten.

31:44.640 --> 31:47.719
Just because snooker players
don't chase a football,

31:47.720 --> 31:51.759
it doesn't mean that we don't need
to be in a prime physical condition.

31:51.760 --> 31:54.799

- Jesus, Brian. It's been a week.

31:56.880 --> 31:59.439
Steve Davis is boring - the end.

31:59.440 --> 32:03.519

One, two, three...

you a little better,

32:24.400 --> 32:27.759

Davis the man even more.

32:27.760 --> 32:31.199
Yeah. Well, you're... you're drunk.

32:31.200 --> 32:32.400
Yes, I am.

32:33.480 --> 32:36.279
But in the morning, I shall be sober,

32:36.280 --> 32:38.159
and you'll still be boring.

32:38.160 --> 32:40.320
Alex, it is the morning.

32:42.480 --> 32:45.319
All right, then, Davis. Are you all set?

32:45.320 --> 32:48.079
I don't suppose you've got
room in the car for one more?

32:48.080 --> 32:50.679
I do, as it happens. Brian, snap to it.

32:50.680 --> 32:52.519

32:52.520 --> 32:55.359

Don't be like that.

32:55.360 --> 32:58.319
I think there's something you need
to talk to your own manager about,

32:58.320 --> 33:00.399
whoever that currently is.

33:00.400 --> 33:03.799
- I intend to.
- Room number, sir?

33:03.800 --> 33:05.280
I'm not staying here.

33:06.360 --> 33:07.520
I can't afford to.

33:09.560 --> 33:12.559
- Right...
- Let me see that.

33:12.560 --> 33:14.879
That is very generous of you, Alex.
Thank you.

33:14.880 --> 33:17.519
Well, you must have got
a good deal for Davis.

33:17.520 --> 33:20.999
- Just imagine what I earn for this trip.
- I don't have to. I know.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.919
Two grand. I got more than that.

33:23.920 --> 33:26.159
Thank you. Most enjoyable.

33:26.160 --> 33:29.079
Well, I wouldn't sign for
you, even if you asked me.

33:29.080 --> 33:31.119
That's good, cos I'm not asking.

33:31.120 --> 33:34.359
Pride, Barry, it's a terrible thing.

33:34.360 --> 33:36.479
You'd snap my hand off.

33:36.480 --> 33:38.599
Where is he? Where's Beadle?

33:38.600 --> 33:43.159
I don't need anyone to hold my hand
and put my suitcase in the car,

33:43.160 --> 33:46.759
but I know you're a bit of a whizz
on the old pocket calculator.

33:46.760 --> 33:51.079
Wait a minute - are you asking me?
No chance!

33:51.080 --> 33:53.719
I'll always be the biggest
draw in the game.

33:53.720 --> 33:56.200

33:58.840 --> 34:00.759

34:00.760 --> 34:04.079
that has no place in what
I'm trying to build here

34:04.080 --> 34:07.439

- Fuck you!

34:07.440 --> 34:11.039
- I don't want to join.
- ..and politeness at all times.

34:11.040 --> 34:14.760

someone as rude as you to IBM?

34:15.880 --> 34:18.839
That is a disgraceful slur

- Yes.
- OK.

52:17.840 --> 52:21.039
- I'm sorry, Barry, this isn't really me, is it?
- Granted, granted,

52:21.040 --> 52:24.999
but then that's not really you,
either, is it, when you're playing?

52:25.000 --> 52:27.479
That's more like tournament Steve.

52:27.480 --> 52:30.919
You see, what we're after here
is a sort of third Steve,

52:30.920 --> 52:33.039

- But I'm boring.

52:33.040 --> 52:34.319
I know you are.

52:34.320 --> 52:37.999
We just need to make you boring
in a really fun way, you know?

52:38.000 --> 52:40.479
- Get you to tell a few jokes.
- I don't know any jokes.

52:40.480 --> 52:41.919
Which is good.

52:48.520 --> 52:50.439

52:50.440 --> 52:52.880
Have a read of some of them, all right?

52:54.280 --> 52:56.879
"I'm so boring my nickname is Steve Davis."

was such a disaster,

make it into the charts.

54:40.480 --> 54:42.079
It's hard for me, too, you know.

54:42.080 --> 54:45.359
- Would it kill you to be just a little bit supportive?
- Alex, I'm pregnant!

54:45.360 --> 54:48.679
- I can't do everything by myself.
- Well, I'm world champion.

54:48.680 --> 54:51.199
- I can do anything I like.
- Pardon?

54:51.200 --> 54:53.839
Look, love, it will just be a couple
of days, no more than a week,

Look, I know I'm not a model husband, OK?
I admit that. But...

01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:10.399
I love you. Right, if you want
me to change, I'll change.

01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:11.919
No, I...

01:00:11.920 --> 01:00:15.199
Listen, I want you to, I really
do, but you will never change.

01:00:15.200 --> 01:00:17.199
I'll never give up my family.

01:00:17.200 --> 01:00:19.119
The Hurricane never gives up.

01:00:19.120 --> 01:00:23.200
- Come home, Lynn.
- I can't do it, I'm sorry.
- Come...
- Alex, I said no.

01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.120
Come on, mate. You can sort this.

01:00:34.040 --> 01:00:35.839
My Maureen gets like this.

01:00:35.840 --> 01:00:37.160
A bit antsy.

01:00:38.880 --> 01:00:41.079
Then she calms down and, you know,

01:00:41.080 --> 01:00:42.920
we just carry on like it never happened.

01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.559
Until the next time.

01:00:45.560 --> 01:00:47.039
HE CHUCKLES

01:00:47.040 --> 01:00:49.080
That's what marriage is.

01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:56.160
Come on, follow me, I'll give you the tour.

01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:01.479
Kitchen, portable colour TV.

01:01:01.480 --> 01:01:03.679
Dishwasher.

01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:05.639
Microwave.

01:01:05.640 --> 01:01:10.480
All you have to do all day is just...
sit around and push buttons.

01:01:11.520 --> 01:01:15.839
Do you really think this is going
to solve all of our problems?

01:01:15.840 --> 01:01:18.320
I know, we'll get an au pair, but...

01:01:19.520 --> 01:01:24.039
..you have to admit, it's a
good place for a fresh start.

01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:27.359
Alex, how many fresh starts can I give you?

01:01:27.360 --> 01:01:28.680
I know.

01:01:29.880 --> 01:01:32.600
I know, it's my final last chance, but...

01:01:35.440 --> 01:01:38.719
You know the Hurricane is never better

01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:41.839
then when his back is against the wall.

01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:43.239
It's too big.

01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:45.279
I'll be lonely when you're not here.

01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:48.720
Oh, and the piece de resistance...

01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:54.759
- My sn...
- Snooker room.

01:01:54.760 --> 01:01:58.760
I can practise here. No more
going away for days on end.

01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:04.039
- And I'm getting a new manager.
- I don't know.
- You don't know?

01:02:04.040 --> 01:02:07.679
What, you don't think we
can afford it? We can.

01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:10.319
Snooker has never been bigger
and I'm back to my best.

01:02:10.320 --> 01:02:12.519
I meant I don't know if I'm ready, Alex.

01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:14.799
I'll win 60 grand for
the Embassy next year.

01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:17.599
- I'll build us a swimming pool.
- Can't even swim.

01:02:17.600 --> 01:02:18.760
For you and the kids.

01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:26.000
Imagine, little Lauren and Jordan,
playing out there, raising hell.

01:02:28.600 --> 01:02:30.880
Be like a real family again.

01:02:33.560 --> 01:02:35.119
I know that's what you want.

01:02:35.120 --> 01:02:36.240
Really.

01:02:41.720 --> 01:02:43.320
Please say yes, because...

01:02:44.800 --> 01:02:46.879
..the truth is,

01:02:46.880 --> 01:02:48.480
I've already bought it.

01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:53.679
It is Monopoly meets KerPlunk.

01:02:53.680 --> 01:02:57.559
- You think people are actually going to buy this?
- Course they will.

01:02:57.560 --> 01:03:00.999
Especially... when I throw
in a pair of these.

01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:03.439
- What have they got to do with snooker?
- Nothing.

01:03:03.440 --> 01:03:05.439
That's the genius bit. PHONE RINGS

01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:09.839
That phone is red-hot. It
will not stop ringing.

01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.559
Buzby's working overtime and I
think I need a new fax machine.

01:03:13.560 --> 01:03:15.919
Barry Hearn.

01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:19.360
No, I do not know if the World
Champion drinks coffee.

01:03:20.640 --> 01:03:22.840
Well, how much are we talking?

01:03:24.200 --> 01:03:28.399
He loves the stuff. He can't get
enough of it, especially...

01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.479
What brand did you say it was again?

01:03:30.480 --> 01:03:32.200
Thank you very much.

01:03:35.280 --> 01:03:37.239
Honestly...

01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:40.320
Would you not rather have my
face on an advert than that?

01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:44.839
Would you not say I'm a much sexier man?

01:03:44.840 --> 01:03:46.880
Oh, yeah, much sexier.

01:03:50.200 --> 01:03:53.359
Have you seen this one?

01:03:53.360 --> 01:03:55.199
I don't read Women's Realm.

01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:59.439
"If I had to choose between sex
and snooker, I'd choose snooker."

01:03:59.440 --> 01:04:01.280
So would she!

01:04:02.360 --> 01:04:05.039
Can you imagine that in bed?

01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:08.840
Spend three minutes walking round
her lining up the fucking shot.

01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:12.039
Probably chalks his bell-end.

01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:13.919
He did win Rear Of The Year.

01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:16.680
- What the fuck are you talking about?
- When it was Sue Pollard.

01:04:18.440 --> 01:04:20.840
Listen, Alex, I can get you deals.

01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.880
Just got Tony Knowles
in with Vidal Sassoon.

01:04:26.080 --> 01:04:28.279
Right.

01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.519
Well... Tony can walk into
any Vidal Sassoon salon,

01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:34.519
anywhere in the country and
get himself a free haircut.

01:04:34.520 --> 01:04:39.680
I'm talking about getting me a TV
advert, not a free fucking haircut.

01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:43.479
Do you have any idea how
much this place cost me?

01:04:43.480 --> 01:04:45.759
I pay you 10%.

01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:49.239
And you just draw a blank.
A Blankety Blank.

01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:52.519
Why can't you even get me
on Blankety fucking Blank?

01:04:52.520 --> 01:04:53.760
People like winners.

01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:58.239
Alex, darling, can I get some money

01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:00.360
cos Caterina wants to
take Lauren into town?

01:05:02.560 --> 01:05:06.400
How am I meant to practise with all
these constant interruptions?!

01:05:12.600 --> 01:05:16.959
MUSIC: The Four Seasons by Antonio Vivaldi

01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.759
Excuse me.

01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:20.159
GENERAL CHATTER

01:05:20.160 --> 01:05:22.080
HE THUMPS DOOR

01:05:27.680 --> 01:05:29.160
What the fuck?

01:05:30.240 --> 01:05:32.679
Are you sure this is a snooker tournament?

01:05:32.680 --> 01:05:36.319
- This place is bigger than your house.
- Don't mention that money pit.

01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:38.720
I have to win this just
to pay the gas bill.

01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:45.879
What the fuck are you doing?

01:05:45.880 --> 01:05:47.600
It's the Goya Matchroom scent.

01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:52.079
It's the international fragrance
for the men who play to win.

01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.919
You wanna be a winner, you've
got to smell like a winner.

01:05:54.920 --> 01:05:59.159
It's a mix of fern needles, tarragon,
pimento, nutmeg, patchouli,

01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:01.159
musk, sandalwood and tonka beans.

01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:03.559
Hey, Grinder, what's all this shit?

01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.720
Beats me, thought we were
here to play goddamn snooker.

01:06:17.200 --> 01:06:22.039
I may be the People's Champion,
but not these fucking people.

01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:24.159
Fucking Romford lot.

01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:25.600
It's all just fake, innit?

01:06:28.080 --> 01:06:29.599
Barry, Barry!

01:06:29.600 --> 01:06:33.319
Can you get us a pint
of that Goya Matchroom?

01:06:33.320 --> 01:06:35.479
I think you've had enough, Alex, don't you?

01:06:35.480 --> 01:06:38.720
Fuck you, Barry. You don't
tell me what to do.

01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:45.360
Jesus, they take it all so seriously now.

01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:49.159
Who is it that made all this possible?

01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:53.639
Got millions to watch so Davis
could line his fucking pockets.

01:06:53.640 --> 01:06:55.519
Barry Hearn.

01:06:55.520 --> 01:06:56.879
Me!

01:06:56.880 --> 01:06:58.759
The Hurricane.

01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:03.440
Before me it was just old farts
taking it in turns to miss.

01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:07.239
HE SNIFFS

01:07:07.240 --> 01:07:08.639
Barry!

01:07:08.640 --> 01:07:11.839
Can we open a window?
Fucking stinks in here.

01:07:11.840 --> 01:07:15.599
Tell you what, Alex, I'll open a door
and you can walk straight out of it.

01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:17.839
As you offering me out, Barry?

01:07:17.840 --> 01:07:20.679
I'll fucking come outside
with you, just give me...

01:07:20.680 --> 01:07:22.799
- I'll fucking kill you!
- Alex! Just have a drink.

01:07:22.800 --> 01:07:24.799
- Come on!
- What are you talking about?!

01:07:24.800 --> 01:07:27.599
Listen to me. Play the game,
you've just got to play snooker

01:07:27.600 --> 01:07:28.999
and take his money, yeah?

01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:31.040
Yeah, that's all he cares about.

01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:34.960
Fuck all this shit.

01:07:37.400 --> 01:07:39.159
Get outta my way!

01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:43.399
This is... This is MY bandwagon.
You know that, Tintin. All right?

01:07:43.400 --> 01:07:45.759

01:07:45.760 --> 01:07:47.839

01:12:08.480 --> 01:12:10.720
- Who is it?
- It's me, it's Jimmy.

01:12:16.200 --> 01:12:19.040
- Come in, then.
- You all right, mate?
- Mm-hm.

01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:23.639
Sorry for all these fucking...

01:12:23.640 --> 01:12:25.199
Um...

01:12:25.200 --> 01:12:26.799
Come in.

01:12:26.800 --> 01:12:28.319
Tried phoning.

01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:31.640
There's a... problem with the phone.

01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:42.200
- Lynn's still not come round, then?
- No.

01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.399
She's, uh...

01:12:47.400 --> 01:12:49.999
She's got a court ruling.

01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:52.960
If I try to see her or the kids then, um...

01:12:54.880 --> 01:12:56.720
..they'll put me in prison.

01:12:58.600 --> 01:12:59.960
I'm sorry, mate.

01:13:02.320 --> 01:13:04.000
It's no-one's fault.

01:13:10.160 --> 01:13:12.199
Have you, uh...

01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:13.600
had breakfast?

01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:17.119
No, no, ta. Can't stop.

01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:19.679
Oh, come on, James.

01:13:19.680 --> 01:13:21.520
I've got a corporate.

01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.160
Haven't seen you for days.

01:13:27.840 --> 01:13:29.000
Cheers.

01:13:32.520 --> 01:13:34.160
Listen, uh...

01:13:36.680 --> 01:13:39.240
I just wanted to be the one to tell you.

01:13:40.880 --> 01:13:42.440
I've signed.

01:13:47.880 --> 01:13:49.720
Barry fucking Hearn.

01:13:51.800 --> 01:13:54.040
Yeah, Barry fucking Hearn.

01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:00.959
He says I can be the Matchroom bad boy.

01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.919
I can still do whatever I want

01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:06.800
as long as I check with him first.

01:14:10.520 --> 01:14:12.040
That's, uh...

01:14:14.840 --> 01:14:16.320
That's great.

01:14:19.360 --> 01:14:21.680
That's the best decision you ever made.

01:14:26.120 --> 01:14:28.720
That's funny cos I thought
you was going to punch me.

01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:35.279
No, but I will if you turn into
one of them Matchroom arseholes.

01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:36.960
You know I won't.

01:14:44.520 --> 01:14:46.919
Me and you, James...

01:14:46.920 --> 01:14:50.280
we're the only two that
ever played for love.

01:14:58.600 --> 01:15:00.320
CAR HORN TOOTS

01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:04.800
I better go.

01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:08.640
Robbo's waiting outside.

01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:14.119
You know, it's funny, I was...

01:15:14.120 --> 01:15:17.000
I was thinking of going
to see Barry myself.

01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.240
He called the other day.

01:15:24.280 --> 01:15:26.399
No.

01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.000
No, definitely, you should.

01:15:29.040 --> 01:15:30.839
Maybe.

01:15:30.840 --> 01:15:32.559
CAR TOOTS AGAIN

01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:34.240
Right, I'll see you, mate.

01:15:36.200 --> 01:15:38.079
Yeah.

01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:39.720
Be lucky, baby.

01:15:41.560 --> 01:15:42.680
DOOR CLOSES

01:15:44.480 --> 01:15:46.399
Don't worry, Frank, he'll pay.

01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:49.280
- HE CHUCKLES
- I'll make him pay.

01:15:50.880 --> 01:15:52.279
I gotta go, Frank.

01:15:52.280 --> 01:15:53.919
KNOCK ON DOOR

01:15:53.920 --> 01:15:57.759
Come in. Yeah, all right,
Frank, I gotta go. Yeah.

01:15:57.760 --> 01:16:00.480
I do know what you mean. OK. Bye.

01:16:01.840 --> 01:16:03.279
Alex.

01:16:03.280 --> 01:16:06.439
Always a pleasure. What do you want?

01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:09.199
I have a bone to pick with you, Baz.

01:16:09.200 --> 01:16:11.679
You've nicked Jimmy.

01:16:11.680 --> 01:16:14.119
I want my practice partner back.

01:16:14.120 --> 01:16:16.399
Drinking partner?

01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:19.879
Well, the amount we drink,
it takes a lot of practice.

01:16:19.880 --> 01:16:22.239
HE CHUCKLES

01:16:22.240 --> 01:16:24.400
So, you're worried about Jimmy?

01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:32.319
I'm a lot of things, Barry,
but I don't hold a grudge.

01:16:32.320 --> 01:16:35.879
You were too proud to ask me in '82.

01:16:35.880 --> 01:16:39.639
I'm sure you had reasons and
you probably regret those now

01:16:39.640 --> 01:16:43.079
since I won the Embassy that year but...

01:16:43.080 --> 01:16:47.559
I'm here to offer you a
chance to put that right...

01:16:47.560 --> 01:16:50.719
and sign the People's Champion.

01:16:50.720 --> 01:16:54.040
So long as the terms of the
contract are right for me.

01:16:57.000 --> 01:17:02.399
"Lean, square-jawed, his good
looks and clean-cut behaviour

01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:05.960
"have made Steve Davis
the hero of Britain."

01:17:07.600 --> 01:17:10.799
This is what I'm building here, Alex.

01:17:10.800 --> 01:17:14.359
Courage Brewery have just
bought Steve Davis for a year.

01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.999
An exclusive contract - £1 million.

01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:21.919
So, unless I accidentally have a lobotomy,

01:17:21.920 --> 01:17:24.879
I'm not going to risk it all on you. Am I?

01:17:24.880 --> 01:17:27.119
Snooker needs me, Barry.

01:17:27.120 --> 01:17:31.640
Do you think people tune in hoping
to watch Davis play Tony Meo?

01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:36.079
I'm the box office - me.

01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:37.560
I know.

01:17:39.040 --> 01:17:41.399
You admit it, you bastard.

01:17:41.400 --> 01:17:43.159
You're right.

01:17:43.160 --> 01:17:45.279
We need you.

01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.679
The millions out there, they don't
tune in to watch the snooker,

01:17:48.680 --> 01:17:51.399
they watch for the soap opera.

01:17:51.400 --> 01:17:53.919
It's Dallas with balls.

01:17:53.920 --> 01:17:57.560
And you're JR and Bobby
Ewing rolled into one.

01:17:58.960 --> 01:18:02.159
You're destroying yourself.
And it's a fact of life

01:18:02.160 --> 01:18:05.159
that millions of people
enjoy watching the process,

01:18:05.160 --> 01:18:08.359
so, yeah, snooker needs you.

01:18:08.360 --> 01:18:10.080
But I don't need you.

01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:16.759
Barry, please.

01:18:16.760 --> 01:18:18.600
Please, I'm begging you.

01:18:20.360 --> 01:18:22.680
I need you to manage me.

01:18:24.800 --> 01:18:26.560
I can't manage on my own.

01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:32.719
I said I'd never change, well...

01:18:32.720 --> 01:18:35.519
I'll change.

01:18:35.520 --> 01:18:37.520
I'll do anything, Barry.

01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:41.360
I'm on my fucking knees here.

01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.840
I can't, Alex.

01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:49.959
I've lost everyone.

01:18:49.960 --> 01:18:52.679
And I've lost my house...

01:18:52.680 --> 01:18:54.280
all the money.

01:18:55.800 --> 01:18:59.480
Fucking Inland Revenue are after me.
You know?

01:19:03.560 --> 01:19:06.319
I'll even give up the drink, Barry.

01:19:06.320 --> 01:19:07.919
I promise.

01:19:07.920 --> 01:19:11.480
You wouldn't last a day, Alex. I-I'm sorry.

01:19:13.960 --> 01:19:16.199
We can do this.

01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:20.359
You know? I could change and...

01:19:20.360 --> 01:19:22.840
You're the only one who can help me.

01:19:26.800 --> 01:19:28.800
I've lost my family.

01:19:32.480 --> 01:19:35.159
Alex, you're a mess.

01:19:35.160 --> 01:19:36.560
Look, um...

01:19:37.920 --> 01:19:41.759
Look, where you headed to? I'll get
Robbo to give you a lift somewhere.

01:19:41.760 --> 01:19:43.600
I've nowhere to go.

01:19:45.440 --> 01:19:46.880
It's...

01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:51.400
I'm sure you know a boozer
open somewhere near here.

01:19:53.400 --> 01:19:54.880
Take it, Alex.

01:20:04.040 --> 01:20:05.680
Take care, Alex.

01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:14.759
COMMENTATOR: Alex Higgins concedes.

01:20:14.760 --> 01:20:18.959
Steve James has played exceptionally well.

01:20:18.960 --> 01:20:22.679
From 5-5 he won five frames in succession

01:20:22.680 --> 01:20:24.920
to win by 10 frames to 5.

01:20:27.880 --> 01:20:30.399
I actually owe Higgins my life.

01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:34.439
True story, right? I was getting
beaten up by three blokes

01:20:34.440 --> 01:20:37.039
and Alex walks round the corner and says,

01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:38.639
"That's probably enough now, lads."

01:20:38.640 --> 01:20:41.920
THEY LAUGH

01:21:00.760 --> 01:21:02.679
Alex.

01:21:02.680 --> 01:21:04.959
Hey, Alex.

01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:08.399
- Why are you even over? I ain't coming to your...
- Just saying, mate.

01:21:08.400 --> 01:21:10.720
- Get the fuck off.
- OK, man.

01:21:14.160 --> 01:21:15.960
Give me another drink, someone.

01:21:49.480 --> 01:21:51.280
How many's he had now?

01:21:53.240 --> 01:21:54.839
Maybe I should go down.

01:21:54.840 --> 01:21:57.519
No, Jimmy. Leave him.

01:21:57.520 --> 01:21:59.400
He won't thank you.

01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:24.360
One more.

01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:48.040
Alex.

01:22:50.800 --> 01:22:52.160
(Fuck off.)

01:22:53.640 --> 01:22:55.480
What are you doing down here?

01:22:56.840 --> 01:22:59.759
- Come to get you, Alex, come on.
- Fuck off.

01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:03.560
- They're turning the lights off, Alex.
- Don't need you to help me.

01:23:04.720 --> 01:23:06.440
I don't need anyone.

01:23:10.520 --> 01:23:14.360
I...fucking... quit.

01:23:18.720 --> 01:23:20.839
You can relax, we'll call it a draw.

01:23:20.840 --> 01:23:24.279
- I'm very sorry to hear that, Alex.
- No, you're not.

01:23:24.280 --> 01:23:26.639
You've got what you always wanted.

01:23:26.640 --> 01:23:29.679
You got rid of the Hurricane.

01:23:29.680 --> 01:23:33.119
You'll find out what it's like soon enough.

01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:36.879
Stephen Hendry will come along
and knock you off your perch

01:23:36.880 --> 01:23:38.920
and then you'll know what it's like.

01:23:40.880 --> 01:23:42.640
Why do you hate me?

01:23:44.080 --> 01:23:47.120
Come on, I don't hate you.
I've never hated you.

01:23:48.480 --> 01:23:49.920
I idolised you.

01:23:51.680 --> 01:23:54.839
When I watched you play I
thought it was genius.

01:23:54.840 --> 01:23:58.640
I wanted to be just like
Alex Higgins. Once.

01:24:01.560 --> 01:24:04.719
That's... That's... No.

01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:07.839
No, that's not true. We've...

01:24:07.840 --> 01:24:10.600
We've always been... enemies.

01:24:12.160 --> 01:24:13.879
I'm not your enemy, Alex.

01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:15.959
You are. And the drink.

01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.080
That's right, blame me. Everyone else does.

01:24:21.440 --> 01:24:23.120
You look after yourself.

01:24:24.560 --> 01:24:26.759
Remember this -

01:24:26.760 --> 01:24:30.559
I'll get the romantic
obituaries when I die.

01:24:30.560 --> 01:24:32.920
And you can keep the fucking money.

01:24:38.560 --> 01:24:40.080
Goodnight!
