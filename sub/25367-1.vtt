00:04.885 --> 00:07.064
Previously on The Affair...

00:07.065 --> 00:08.899
Do you remember
the first time you saw her?

00:08.900 --> 00:10.132
Like it was yesterday.

00:11.833 --> 00:13.087
I have to leave.

00:13.088 --> 00:15.458
We've lived together for half our lives.

00:15.459 --> 00:17.016
I'm in love with someone else.

00:17.017 --> 00:18.976
I want you to get the
fuck out of my house.

00:18.977 --> 00:20.420
What if I moved to Montauk?

00:20.421 --> 00:22.750
- Why?
- To be with you.

00:22.751 --> 00:25.205
Look, I know I was a jerk, but I...

00:25.206 --> 00:27.109
I just got out of three years in prison.

00:27.110 --> 00:29.324
I don't want what I used to.

00:29.325 --> 00:30.580
I just want a simple life.

00:30.581 --> 00:32.240
I just want to get back into teaching.

00:32.241 --> 00:33.583
I want to live with someone I love.

00:33.584 --> 00:35.243
You were the best thing
that ever happened to me.

00:35.244 --> 00:38.041
No, I, uh... I
want a divorce, Noah.

00:38.042 --> 00:39.239
How's Vik?

00:40.187 --> 00:41.645
He's good.

00:42.417 --> 00:44.999
He just got a major job offer in L.A.

00:45.000 --> 00:46.671
The children's hospital there.

00:46.672 --> 00:48.583
This fella's quite a catch.

00:48.584 --> 00:51.008
Handsome, polite, a doctor.

00:51.009 --> 00:54.666
Anyone would be an improvement
after your first husband.

00:54.667 --> 00:56.332
Noah's not doing well, huh?

00:56.333 --> 00:57.999
Well, he's downstairs.

00:58.000 --> 00:59.892
I'll tell him to leave right now.

00:59.893 --> 01:01.561
You do what you want, Helen.

01:01.562 --> 01:03.145
Because I get how this goes.

01:03.146 --> 01:04.172
He leaves now.

01:04.173 --> 01:05.541
Whenever he shows up with his bullshit,

01:05.542 --> 01:07.207
you let him right back fucking in.

01:07.208 --> 01:09.026
Why can't you just let him go?

01:09.027 --> 01:10.317
Thing is, for my whole life,

01:10.318 --> 01:12.664
I've had this idea that
I'm a good person,

01:12.665 --> 01:14.583
and, uh, it's not true.

01:14.584 --> 01:15.875
No, it's not.

01:15.876 --> 01:17.207
Good-bye.

01:17.208 --> 01:19.249
I killed Scott Lockhart.

01:19.250 --> 01:21.041
It wasn't Noah.

01:21.042 --> 01:24.066
That is why I let Noah back in.

01:24.067 --> 01:25.871
Because I felt like I owed him

01:25.872 --> 01:27.774
and I was trying to fix what I did.

01:27.775 --> 01:30.281
It was not because I loved him.

01:30.282 --> 01:31.925
I'll find you after work.

01:33.356 --> 01:35.049
Being a parent is hard.

01:35.050 --> 01:36.534
And I know we haven't done it perfectly,

01:36.535 --> 01:39.015
but I learned from my parents' mistakes,

01:39.016 --> 01:41.583
and your mother learned from hers,

01:41.584 --> 01:43.728
just as you'll learn from our mistakes.

01:43.729 --> 01:46.666
Until someone someday

01:46.667 --> 01:49.551
finally has a perfect childhood.

01:51.804 --> 01:53.391
Where we going, buddy?

03:37.251 --> 03:39.578
It's been 72 hours. No one's seen her.

03:40.500 --> 03:42.709
She hasn't called to check in on Joanie.

03:45.933 --> 03:48.219
The police have declared
her a missing person.

04:01.814 --> 04:04.814
_

04:05.995 --> 04:08.995
_

04:32.375 --> 04:34.041
I just think it's important

04:34.042 --> 04:36.041
for you to get settled in first.

04:36.042 --> 04:37.902
I am settled, Helen.

04:37.903 --> 04:39.356
I'm in a three-bedroom house.

04:39.357 --> 04:40.499
I got a room for each of them.

04:40.500 --> 04:43.416
I got board games, trampoline.

04:43.417 --> 04:45.833
Are we still litigating custody here?

04:45.834 --> 04:48.125
No, Noah, it's just that weekends

04:48.126 --> 04:49.777
are really important to them right now.

04:49.778 --> 04:51.631
They're making all sorts
of new friends out here.

04:51.632 --> 04:54.203
Okay, but the fact remains
that I moved all the way

04:54.204 --> 04:56.809
out here to Los Angeles just
to be close to my children,

04:56.810 --> 04:58.135
and I'm not seeing them.

04:58.136 --> 04:59.929
Look, Noah, I really don't want

04:59.930 --> 05:01.282
to get into this right now, okay?

05:01.283 --> 05:03.001
We're running late, and I
have to get them to school.

05:03.701 --> 05:06.767
Okay, will you just tell Trevor
I'll be at his thing tonight?

05:06.768 --> 05:09.291
Please. Helen? Helen?

05:12.111 --> 05:13.861
Asshole.

05:45.166 --> 05:46.458
Hey, Victor.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.041
Did you get any sleep last night?

05:49.042 --> 05:51.331
The baby was up like every half hour.

05:51.332 --> 05:53.124
Believe it or not, you'll miss it.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.950
Yeah? You want to trade?

05:54.951 --> 05:56.249
I don't miss it that much.

05:57.781 --> 06:00.218
So, come on, somebody tell me, why...

06:00.886 --> 06:03.013
why do none of the other animals

06:03.580 --> 06:05.899
stand up to the tyrant Napoleon

06:05.900 --> 06:07.611
or his mouthpiece, Squealer?

06:07.612 --> 06:08.817
These pigs?

06:09.671 --> 06:10.837
Anybody?

06:11.748 --> 06:13.607
Come on. You're teenagers.

06:13.608 --> 06:17.695
Don't you ever feel
oppressed or misunderstood?

06:19.542 --> 06:21.173
Yes, great. Martina.

06:21.174 --> 06:24.455
So, like, Mr. Solloway,
I've been wondering,

06:24.456 --> 06:25.620
are you married?

06:25.621 --> 06:27.624
'Cause, like, I don't see no ring.

06:27.625 --> 06:29.958
Actually, I'm divorced. Twice.

06:29.959 --> 06:32.708
Ooh! I
like a man with a past.

06:32.709 --> 06:34.151
Okay, okay.

06:34.152 --> 06:36.416
Who'd like to read? Somebody?

06:36.417 --> 06:38.632
Anybody?

06:40.709 --> 06:42.708
Yes, Martina, go on.

06:43.429 --> 06:46.068
Oh. If I read, Mr. Solloway,

06:46.591 --> 06:48.166
- can I be number three?
- Ooh!

06:48.167 --> 06:51.789
Martina, I have much loftier
aspirations for you than that.

06:51.790 --> 06:54.833
But yes, you can read. Page, uh, 53.

06:54.834 --> 06:59.169
Um, Squealer's speech,
starting, "No one believes..."

07:00.114 --> 07:03.227
"No one believes more firmly
than Comrade Napoleon

07:03.228 --> 07:05.875
that all animals are equal."

07:05.876 --> 07:07.541
Come on, guys. Who is that?

07:07.542 --> 07:09.041
Can you silence it, please?

07:09.042 --> 07:11.499
Go on, Martina.

07:11.500 --> 07:14.374
Um... "And then where should we be?

07:14.375 --> 07:16.916
Suppose you had decided to
follow Snowball, with his

07:16.917 --> 07:18.806
moonshine of windmills.

07:18.807 --> 07:20.772
- Snowball, who, as we know..."
- Wh...? Hang on, Martina.

07:20.773 --> 07:22.299
Just wait. What...?

07:23.000 --> 07:24.040
- Give that to me.
- No, mister, please.

07:24.041 --> 07:25.904
- Give me the phone.
- It's just my brother.

07:25.905 --> 07:27.744
He's giving me a ride
to my job after school.

07:27.745 --> 07:29.185
I-I work at KFC.

07:29.186 --> 07:31.526
Jaime, I'm-I'm teaching
an allegory on tyranny,

07:31.527 --> 07:32.692
and you'll know the meaning of that

07:32.693 --> 07:34.419
if you don't put that away right now.

07:34.420 --> 07:35.875
- Okay.
- Now, put it on silent.

07:36.520 --> 07:37.678
All right.

07:37.679 --> 07:39.459
Okay, thank you, Martina.

07:43.029 --> 07:44.176
Anton.

07:44.177 --> 07:46.136
The passage Martina just read,

07:46.137 --> 07:48.056
where Squealer is basically saying,

07:48.057 --> 07:50.082
"We'd love to let you
make your own decisions,

07:50.083 --> 07:52.625
but we can't because you might
make the wrong decisions,"

07:53.125 --> 07:54.854
you want to tell us
what you make of that?

07:56.267 --> 07:57.335
No.

07:57.839 --> 07:59.441
Come on. We'd all love to hear.

08:01.565 --> 08:02.799
Sorry for y'all.

08:06.177 --> 08:08.346
Okay, I get it. It's a tough passage.

08:08.347 --> 08:10.416
So let's, um... let's break it down.

08:10.417 --> 08:12.097
I said I don't feel like it.

08:12.098 --> 08:13.230
I know you don't feel like it,

08:13.231 --> 08:16.147
but I want you to participate
in the class, okay?

08:16.148 --> 08:18.249
So I'd like you to read it.

08:18.250 --> 08:19.946
And you might understand it better.

08:20.553 --> 08:21.673
Come on, read the passage.

08:21.674 --> 08:22.832
I want you to do it.

08:22.833 --> 08:24.358
You need to participate.

08:24.359 --> 08:25.880
I mean it. Anton...

08:25.881 --> 08:28.624
I said no.

08:34.440 --> 08:37.495
Principal Wilson, how can we help you?

08:37.496 --> 08:39.125
Don't mind me.

08:42.365 --> 08:43.485
Okay.

08:47.667 --> 08:51.458
Okay, so, uh, we were looking
at, uh, Squealer's quote.

08:51.459 --> 08:53.708
Well, he's trying to
come across as benign,

08:53.709 --> 08:55.318
but he isn't, is he?

08:55.751 --> 08:56.870
What is he?

08:59.748 --> 09:02.041
No problem. It's a tough question.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.082
When we get a tough question,

09:03.083 --> 09:04.958
we go back to the book for the answers.

09:08.083 --> 09:09.291
Jaime.

09:15.765 --> 09:17.058
But Mr. Solloway said it was okay.

09:17.059 --> 09:18.558
- No, I did not say that.
- Yes, you did.

09:18.559 --> 09:19.812
- Come on, man.
- No, I didn't.

09:19.813 --> 09:21.207
No, it was a pedagogical...

09:21.208 --> 09:23.250
It was a... a teaching thing. It was...

09:24.959 --> 09:27.983
Mr. Ramos, you can retrieve it at
the end of the day from my office.

09:27.984 --> 09:30.278
Oh, come on, Mr. Solloway.
I thought we were friends.

09:30.279 --> 09:32.291
Jaime is trying to contact his brother

09:32.292 --> 09:34.326
who is giving him a ride
to work after school.

09:35.025 --> 09:37.124
Jaime is an only child.

09:39.000 --> 09:40.593
Brother from another mother?

09:40.594 --> 09:41.997
I think you and your phone

09:41.998 --> 09:45.083
can spend the rest of the
day with me. Let's go.

09:49.384 --> 09:52.291
Mr. Gatewood, take down that hood.

09:58.602 --> 09:59.734
Thank you.

10:12.687 --> 10:14.724
Janelle does that to
my classes, too, man.

10:15.277 --> 10:16.916
Always sitting in.

10:16.917 --> 10:18.935
And I've been at this charter
since the beginning.

10:19.743 --> 10:21.222
Sorry. I'm lost again.

10:21.223 --> 10:22.332
What are you trying to do?

10:22.333 --> 10:23.948
Trying to record the
grades from this quiz.

10:23.949 --> 10:25.450
Oh, go back to your home page.

10:25.451 --> 10:26.901
Click on that tab.

10:27.751 --> 10:30.103
That'll take you to your
grading landing page.

10:30.104 --> 10:31.249
Oh, thank you.

10:31.250 --> 10:33.495
Sorry. We didn't really have any of this

10:33.496 --> 10:34.489
last time I was teaching.

10:34.490 --> 10:35.916
I'll bet. You're a lot older

10:35.917 --> 10:37.351
than the last guy I
shared this room with.

10:40.818 --> 10:42.942
So, should I be worried about Janelle?

10:44.658 --> 10:49.266
To be honest, I think
she's overcompensating.

10:49.267 --> 10:50.583
Because she knows her hiring's

10:50.584 --> 10:52.458
an act of affirmative action.

10:53.633 --> 10:55.916
Look, never mind. My wife
says I'm not allowed

10:55.917 --> 11:00.331
to say things like that anymore,
so just, uh, forget it.

11:01.212 --> 11:02.833
Let me ask you another writing question.

11:02.834 --> 11:03.875
Mm-hmm.

11:05.218 --> 11:08.251
When you finished your first manuscript,

11:09.250 --> 11:12.624
- how'd you get it out there?
- Uh...

11:12.625 --> 11:15.012
well, you make a lot of
contacts in grad school.

11:15.752 --> 11:16.801
Oh.

11:17.744 --> 11:19.233
Joel, what does "RD" mean?

11:19.234 --> 11:20.875
It means the kid's retaking the class.

11:21.402 --> 11:24.112
I thought AP English was
only available to seniors.

11:24.706 --> 11:25.731
Oh.

11:25.732 --> 11:27.291
Anton Gatewood?

11:28.498 --> 11:31.349
He was supposed to graduate last spring.

11:31.350 --> 11:33.015
Plagiarized in the second semester,

11:33.016 --> 11:35.634
so Janelle made your
predecessor fail him.

11:35.635 --> 11:38.198
Now the kid's gotta take
the whole year again.

11:42.127 --> 11:43.853
So let me ask you a question.

11:45.236 --> 11:46.928
Do you still have an agent?

11:46.929 --> 11:48.624
Uh, hope so.

11:48.625 --> 11:51.458
Sent him a manuscript a
couple of months ago.

12:01.091 --> 12:03.375
You think there's any
way you could, uh...

12:14.146 --> 12:16.146
Go, go, go!

12:24.500 --> 12:26.332
Hi. It's Helen. Leave a message.

12:26.333 --> 12:27.666
Hey, it's me.

12:27.667 --> 12:28.875
I'm completely stuck in traffic.

12:28.876 --> 12:30.416
It says I'm a half mile away

12:30.417 --> 12:31.916
but it's gonna take 40 fucking minutes,

12:31.917 --> 12:33.298
so just tell...

12:33.299 --> 12:35.232
just tell Trevor I'll be there, okay?

12:41.000 --> 12:43.151
Sir. Can I ask where you're going?

12:43.152 --> 12:44.337
Uh, yeah. Sorry I'm late.

12:44.338 --> 12:45.883
My, uh, son is a student here.

12:45.884 --> 12:47.000
Trevor Solloway.

12:49.296 --> 12:50.296
Name?

12:51.595 --> 12:52.795
What, my name?

12:52.796 --> 12:54.655
I'm his father, Noah Solloway.

12:57.679 --> 12:58.708
Nope.

12:58.709 --> 13:00.332
"Nope"? What do you mean, "nope"?

13:00.333 --> 13:01.958
Nope, you're not on the list.

13:01.959 --> 13:03.510
Do you have a school I.D.?

13:04.920 --> 13:07.588
Uh, how do... how do I get one?

13:07.589 --> 13:08.715
It's online, sir.

13:08.716 --> 13:11.426
Any parent wanting access to
the grounds needs to register.

13:11.427 --> 13:13.143
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Garrison.

13:13.144 --> 13:14.316
How are you?

13:14.317 --> 13:15.878
How's it going? Come on in.

13:16.399 --> 13:19.082
Okay, look, I can't do that,
so can I get a temporary one?

13:19.083 --> 13:20.791
- Can I take one of these?
- Nope.

13:20.792 --> 13:21.875
Look, my son is in there.

13:21.876 --> 13:25.291
Sir, I cannot let you
through without a pass.

13:25.292 --> 13:27.041
Can you imagine if I let you in

13:27.042 --> 13:29.750
and your ex has a restraining
order out against you

13:29.751 --> 13:31.583
and it's her night with the kids?

13:31.584 --> 13:32.687
Hmm?

13:34.038 --> 13:35.458
How'd you know I'm divorced?

13:35.459 --> 13:36.899
Wild guess.

13:39.959 --> 13:41.238
Helen.

13:41.239 --> 13:42.889
Helen, pick up.

13:43.813 --> 13:46.332
Helen, I'm out... I'm at the entrance,

13:46.333 --> 13:48.124
and, um, he won't let me in.

13:48.125 --> 13:49.916
You didn't put my name
on the list, so, um,

13:49.917 --> 13:52.207
can you come vouch for me or whatever?

13:52.208 --> 13:53.833
And, uh...

13:55.084 --> 13:56.959
just call me, please.

14:07.038 --> 14:09.164
You're an asshole. You know that?

14:24.792 --> 14:26.166
Hey, Trevor.

14:26.167 --> 14:27.349
Stacey.

14:28.329 --> 14:29.791
Hey. Hey.

14:32.959 --> 14:34.835
Noah, I didn't think you could make it.

14:35.584 --> 14:37.264
No, we talked about this, Helen.

14:38.110 --> 14:39.545
What are you doing here?

14:40.670 --> 14:42.610
You didn't tell Trevor I was coming?

14:43.051 --> 14:44.796
Let's not do this in front of the kids.

14:44.797 --> 14:45.978
Sorry, do what?

14:45.979 --> 14:47.564
We talked about this this morning.

14:47.565 --> 14:48.856
We talked over the weekend.

14:48.857 --> 14:50.917
- This was in my calendar.
- Okay, well, sorry.

14:50.918 --> 14:53.287
I made a mistake. I got confused.

14:53.288 --> 14:54.904
We just have... we have
a lot going on, so...

14:54.905 --> 14:56.458
No, I'm not... I'm not
making a thing of it.

14:56.459 --> 14:57.893
It's just that I was stuck out here.

14:57.894 --> 14:59.213
My name wasn't on the list.

14:59.214 --> 15:00.896
Looks like it was an honest mistake.

15:01.643 --> 15:03.603
I'm not saying it wasn't. I'm just...

15:09.333 --> 15:11.967
I know. I just wanted to show
the kids that I was here.

15:13.042 --> 15:14.899
That I am here.

15:15.439 --> 15:16.916
Message received, Dad.

15:26.166 --> 15:28.086
Look, come to dinner.

15:29.406 --> 15:30.641
We're going to Mexican.

15:31.921 --> 15:32.933
You should come.

15:33.414 --> 15:34.460
Yeah, Dad.

15:34.876 --> 15:36.227
You should come with us.

15:55.377 --> 15:56.395
Hey.

15:56.396 --> 15:58.124
Sorry I'm late.

15:58.125 --> 15:59.166
Hey, Dad.

16:00.792 --> 16:02.002
Should I sit there?

16:02.003 --> 16:03.875
Is this taken?

16:03.876 --> 16:05.082
Thanks.

16:05.083 --> 16:07.916
Uh, I put, uh, Los Angeles into the GPS

16:07.917 --> 16:09.416
instead of Santa Monica, so...

16:09.417 --> 16:11.416
Ah. Yeah.

16:11.417 --> 16:13.249
Santa Monica's a whole different city.

16:13.250 --> 16:15.083
You'll figure it out.
It just takes time.

16:16.210 --> 16:19.251
Uh, can I get a margarita,
please, no salt?

16:19.252 --> 16:20.586
All right, thanks.

16:23.291 --> 16:27.501
So, kids, guess what I spent
last weekend setting up.

16:27.502 --> 16:28.914
- What?
- Trampoline.

16:28.915 --> 16:30.481
- Trampoline?
- Yeah.

16:30.482 --> 16:32.499
Plus, I got some furniture
for your rooms,

16:32.500 --> 16:35.124
so hopefully you can come for
a sleepover sometime soon.

16:35.125 --> 16:37.762
Um, I'll come over for a day,

16:37.763 --> 16:39.958
but I don't think I'm gonna sleep over.

16:39.959 --> 16:41.583
Why not?

16:41.584 --> 16:44.003
Topanga Canyon's creepy.

16:45.834 --> 16:47.714
What's creepy about Topanga?

16:47.715 --> 16:49.374
Mom told her Charles Manson

16:49.375 --> 16:50.785
lived there once.

16:53.248 --> 16:54.411
He did.

16:58.121 --> 17:01.165
How do you even know
who Charles Manson is?

17:01.166 --> 17:03.625
I didn't, and then I YouTubed it.

17:04.666 --> 17:05.666
Thanks a lot.

17:10.307 --> 17:13.153
How about you, Trev?
Sleepover, just you and me?

17:15.000 --> 17:17.833
Um, his weekends are kind of packed.

17:18.890 --> 17:20.750
He can speak for himself.

17:20.751 --> 17:22.415
Well, I mean,

17:22.416 --> 17:25.332
yeah, we can try and get
something on the calendar, Dad.

17:26.030 --> 17:27.624
Okay, something on the calendar.

17:27.625 --> 17:29.686
Oh, Mom, Vik, I wanted to talk

17:29.687 --> 17:31.458
to you guys about drivers' ed.

17:31.459 --> 17:32.505
- Okay, but...
- So...

17:32.506 --> 17:34.541
Maybe we'll wait six months?

17:34.542 --> 17:37.166
No, no, no, I'm gonna be
15 so soon, and, you know,

17:37.167 --> 17:38.875
it's good to get a head start.

17:38.876 --> 17:40.666
Can I get that margarita, please?

17:40.667 --> 17:41.958
So, what happened...

17:41.959 --> 17:43.425
what happened with teacher night?

17:43.426 --> 17:44.652
Curriculum night?

17:44.653 --> 17:46.166
It went really, really
well, right, Trev?

17:46.167 --> 17:47.374
Yeah.

17:47.375 --> 17:48.791
I really wish I had been there.

17:48.792 --> 17:50.071
I wanted to see what you were doing.

17:50.072 --> 17:52.004
He was just telling
us more about the project

17:52.005 --> 17:54.249
he's working on in the
unit they're studying.

17:54.250 --> 17:55.443
What's the project?

17:55.444 --> 17:57.166
Oh, yeah, so there's this girl,

17:57.167 --> 17:59.541
and she lives in a funeral home.

17:59.542 --> 18:00.986
Is it a book or...

18:00.987 --> 18:02.451
It's a graphic novel.

18:02.452 --> 18:04.466
And the girl thinks that she

18:04.467 --> 18:06.504
- might be...
- Yeah.

18:06.505 --> 18:08.315
Gay. But not just thinks.

18:08.316 --> 18:09.546
She is gay.

18:09.547 --> 18:10.875
And as she grows up,

18:10.876 --> 18:13.423
she begins to realize that
her dad was gay, too,

18:13.424 --> 18:14.750
but closeted.

18:15.583 --> 18:17.675
And your partner on this is Brooklyn?

18:17.676 --> 18:19.541
Sorry, what's Brooklyn? Is that a...

18:19.542 --> 18:20.935
Is that a person or...

18:20.936 --> 18:22.602
Brooklyn's a boy.

18:24.128 --> 18:27.548
Okay, so... so Brooklyn's your friend.

18:28.382 --> 18:30.458
I-I don't understand what's going on.

18:30.459 --> 18:33.012
Curriculum night was
definitely interesting.

18:34.917 --> 18:37.969
- And so, uh...
- Yeah, so, um,

18:37.970 --> 18:38.999
in the special unit,

18:39.000 --> 18:40.935
we then take our chosen graphic novel

18:40.936 --> 18:42.801
and study the social issues

18:42.802 --> 18:44.541
and history that make up its worldview.

18:44.542 --> 18:45.753
Mm-hmm.

18:45.754 --> 18:48.730
And in this case, it
would be gay rights?

18:49.587 --> 18:50.750
Exactly.

18:50.751 --> 18:52.916
What-what is this graphic novel?

18:52.917 --> 18:53.959
Fun Home.

18:55.366 --> 18:56.875
Oh, Fun... Wasn't that a musical?

18:56.876 --> 18:58.862
Yes, on Broadway, actually.

18:58.863 --> 19:01.633
Anyway, it's a really cool way to learn.

19:01.634 --> 19:04.791
Yeah. Okay, what
I was wondering, Trev,

19:04.792 --> 19:07.750
is, um... I was wondering,
is there anything

19:07.751 --> 19:11.063
you're trying to express

19:11.064 --> 19:14.263
or communicate to us,

19:14.264 --> 19:16.849
um, with your choice of material?

19:16.850 --> 19:20.903
Because I hope that you know we love

19:20.904 --> 19:23.953
and accept everything about you,

19:23.954 --> 19:26.332
whatever you are.

19:26.983 --> 19:29.068
Yeah. I know.

19:30.778 --> 19:32.291
Every part of you.

19:32.292 --> 19:33.791
- Yeah, I know.
- Hey.

19:33.792 --> 19:35.675
Helen, can I get a word, please?

19:36.000 --> 19:37.375
Sure.

19:40.355 --> 19:41.875
I'm sorry.

19:41.876 --> 19:43.084
What's going on out there?

19:43.085 --> 19:45.704
He's been inseparable from this boy.

19:45.705 --> 19:47.185
- Brooklyn?
- Brooklyn, yes.

19:47.186 --> 19:48.951
And it's something I've
suspected for a long time,

19:48.952 --> 19:50.750
- and now finally...
- Suspected? What...?

19:50.751 --> 19:52.413
He's gay, Noah.

19:53.127 --> 19:54.393
Wait. So...

19:54.394 --> 19:57.708
So, what I was seeing out
there was some kind of...

19:57.709 --> 20:00.124
some kind of attempt
to make him say that?

20:00.125 --> 20:02.624
Ugh, I really, really wish

20:02.625 --> 20:04.416
you had been to curriculum night.

20:04.417 --> 20:06.249
Yeah, I-I really tried.

20:06.250 --> 20:07.791
Look, I don't know.

20:07.792 --> 20:09.937
It just seems to me very obvious.

20:09.938 --> 20:11.559
You should see his art.

20:11.560 --> 20:13.497
And then this boy, Brooklyn.

20:13.498 --> 20:15.833
And even his choice of... of material.

20:15.834 --> 20:17.666
It's-it's just plain as day.

20:17.667 --> 20:20.624
Okay, okay, first of
all, he's 14, Helen.

20:20.625 --> 20:23.166
Maybe... maybe he's exploring things,

20:23.167 --> 20:25.124
but it's way too early

20:25.125 --> 20:26.906
to try to get him to confess to some...

20:26.907 --> 20:29.166
Look, it was on the tip of his tongue.

20:29.167 --> 20:31.624
I swear to you, he was about to say it.

20:31.625 --> 20:33.166
Was he? Really, was he?

20:33.167 --> 20:34.352
Or were you leading him?

20:34.353 --> 20:36.861
'Cause what I saw was you
were definitely leading him.

20:37.762 --> 20:39.275
This is ridiculous.

20:40.876 --> 20:43.035
More ridiculous than
trying to out your son

20:43.036 --> 20:44.958
in a Mexican restaurant, when
he might not even be gay?

20:44.959 --> 20:46.485
He is gay. And hey, guess what.

20:46.486 --> 20:47.818
I have an idea, why don't you just

20:47.819 --> 20:49.583
admit you have a problem with it?

20:49.584 --> 20:51.467
I don't have a problem
with it, if he is.

20:51.468 --> 20:53.060
- He is.
- Okay, fine.

20:53.061 --> 20:54.708
But shouldn't it still be his choice

20:54.709 --> 20:56.833
as to when and where
he wants to come out?

20:56.834 --> 20:58.110
- That's what I'm saying.
- He was about to,

20:58.111 --> 20:59.114
until you walked in.

20:59.115 --> 21:00.451
You intimidate him.

21:02.000 --> 21:03.708
Helen, why are you doing this?

21:03.709 --> 21:05.041
Doing what?

21:05.042 --> 21:06.875
I move all the way out here...

21:06.876 --> 21:08.058
Yeah, to be with the kids, right?

21:09.307 --> 21:11.290
I don't intimidate him or Stacey.

21:11.291 --> 21:12.746
I just don't know them anymore.

21:12.747 --> 21:14.212
That's why I'm here.

21:14.213 --> 21:16.442
And you're doing
everything in your power

21:16.443 --> 21:18.484
to box me out of their lives.

21:18.485 --> 21:20.166
You know what I'm not doing anymore?

21:20.167 --> 21:21.208
This.

21:27.270 --> 21:28.495
I'm sorry.

22:49.164 --> 22:51.075
Hey, Alison, it's Noah.

22:51.076 --> 22:52.958
Uh, sorry to call so late.

22:52.959 --> 22:55.276
Um, just checking in.

22:56.229 --> 22:57.542
Okay, bye.

23:12.625 --> 23:14.602
Hey, Max, uh...

23:15.449 --> 23:16.587
it's Noah.

23:17.505 --> 23:18.547
Believe it or not.

23:19.667 --> 23:20.883
I'm, uh...

23:22.090 --> 23:23.269
just reaching out.

23:23.944 --> 23:25.055
Hope you're well.

23:25.056 --> 23:26.305
Bye.

23:39.989 --> 23:41.921
Anton Gatewood.

24:19.927 --> 24:23.045
Beginning Wednesday, get
ready for The Waste Land.

24:24.869 --> 24:26.082
Anton.

24:26.083 --> 24:27.564
Hold back, please.

24:27.565 --> 24:29.124
Uh, I gotta meet my ride.

24:29.125 --> 24:30.803
Your ride can wait a minute.

24:40.333 --> 24:41.809
I want to talk about your essay.

24:42.250 --> 24:43.562
What about it?

24:49.291 --> 24:50.697
It's, uh...

24:51.891 --> 24:53.923
it's very, very, very well done.

24:54.785 --> 24:55.837
Is that right?

24:56.477 --> 25:00.015
Yeah. Your analysis of
propaganda in the novel

25:00.016 --> 25:04.294
and showing how language
can be manipulated to...

25:05.061 --> 25:06.820
wield power, it's-it's not just good.

25:06.821 --> 25:09.617
It's... it's brilliant.

25:13.308 --> 25:14.346
Okay.

25:15.164 --> 25:16.874
So, is that what you
wanted to talk about?

25:18.608 --> 25:19.624
Yeah.

25:19.625 --> 25:21.437
It's really, really good.

25:22.042 --> 25:25.357
So, what I want to know
is... who wrote it?

25:27.713 --> 25:28.837
What do you mean?

25:29.452 --> 25:30.763
Just what I said.

25:32.264 --> 25:34.575
Who wrote this brilliant essay?

25:35.399 --> 25:36.794
'Cause I don't think it was you.

25:40.016 --> 25:41.130
Why not?

25:42.177 --> 25:43.499
Well, let's look at the evidence.

25:43.500 --> 25:45.295
You refuse to participate in class.

25:45.296 --> 25:48.379
You just sit there with your head
on the desk and your hoodie up.

25:48.380 --> 25:50.507
Yeah, maybe 'cause your
class fucking sucks.

25:51.905 --> 25:53.969
We both know your history of plagiarism.

25:55.237 --> 25:57.139
What do you think would happen
if you got caught again?

25:57.140 --> 25:58.630
If I went straight to Principal Wilson

25:58.631 --> 25:59.869
with this right now?

25:59.870 --> 26:01.009
You think that's funny?

26:01.010 --> 26:02.563
You think your future is funny?

26:02.564 --> 26:04.374
No, man. You funny to me.

26:04.375 --> 26:05.811
Why is that?

26:10.959 --> 26:12.196
Okay.

26:12.888 --> 26:14.056
How about this quote?

26:14.807 --> 26:17.792
"The others said that Squealer
could turn black into white."

26:19.749 --> 26:20.813
Okay.

26:21.167 --> 26:22.831
Explain to me what that means.

26:31.411 --> 26:34.082
So, in the novel, Squealer represents

26:34.083 --> 26:36.332
the propaganda machinery
that despotic states develop

26:36.333 --> 26:38.709
in order to control their populace.

26:38.710 --> 26:41.041
Under Stalin, it was Dmitri Shepilov.

26:41.042 --> 26:42.833
Under Hitler, it was Goebbels.

26:42.834 --> 26:44.124
And the quote,

26:44.125 --> 26:45.368
"turning black into white,"

26:45.369 --> 26:47.173
is just a simplistic
way of Squealer saying

26:47.174 --> 26:48.968
that he can make evil
sound like it was good.

26:49.822 --> 26:52.892
Orwell expanded on this idea
in Nineteen Eighty-Four

26:52.893 --> 26:54.554
with Oceania's Ministry of the Truth,

26:54.555 --> 26:58.408
the irony being that all
Ministry does is lie.

26:59.663 --> 27:00.663
Anything else?

27:08.860 --> 27:10.041
Anton.

27:15.166 --> 27:16.166
Anton.

27:18.257 --> 27:19.834
Anton, come on.

27:21.667 --> 27:23.257
I owe you an apology.

27:23.258 --> 27:24.750
Fuck you.

28:13.460 --> 28:16.604
_

28:39.429 --> 28:41.720
How the fuck do they stay up there?

29:00.954 --> 29:02.226
What are you doing?

29:03.166 --> 29:04.166
Nothing.

29:15.792 --> 29:17.906
- Are you obsessing?
- No.

29:46.208 --> 29:48.021
Stacey, breakfast.

29:48.022 --> 29:49.658
I'm finishing my math homework.

29:49.659 --> 29:53.048
Well, you can finish it while you eat.

29:53.996 --> 29:55.281
Just a minute.

29:55.282 --> 29:57.498
Trevor, can you please turn that down?

29:58.393 --> 29:59.403
Sure, Mom.

29:59.856 --> 30:02.655
- Who's texting you, anyway?
- Brooklyn.

30:02.656 --> 30:05.458
Brooklyn, as in our former borough?

30:05.459 --> 30:06.714
No, Mom.

30:06.715 --> 30:08.458
Brooklyn's my friend.

30:08.459 --> 30:09.750
Oh.

30:09.751 --> 30:12.041
Well, that's a lot of texts.

30:12.042 --> 30:13.454
What, does she have a crush on you?

30:13.455 --> 30:15.750
Wrong gender. Brooklyn's a boy.

30:16.983 --> 30:18.959
Oh. Okay.

30:20.799 --> 30:21.881
- Hey.
- Hey.

30:21.882 --> 30:22.925
Look.

30:24.409 --> 30:26.636
I think I've lost like eight pounds.

30:26.637 --> 30:29.228
Maybe you should lay
off the green juices.

30:30.083 --> 30:31.797
Thought you were going to relax today.

30:31.798 --> 30:33.569
Um, I am relaxed.

30:33.570 --> 30:36.249
- Stacey!
- Just a minute!

30:36.250 --> 30:38.562
I told you I'd get them to school.

30:38.563 --> 30:40.458
You could've slept in, gone to yoga.

30:40.459 --> 30:41.916
Well, I'll relax right after this.

30:41.917 --> 30:43.024
- I promise.
- Babe.

30:43.025 --> 30:44.443
- Yeah?
- Come here.

30:44.444 --> 30:45.615
- No.
- Come here.

30:45.616 --> 30:47.332
Oh, shit.

30:47.333 --> 30:49.166
I have mayonnaise all over my fingers.

30:49.167 --> 30:51.079
What are you so worried about?

30:51.080 --> 30:53.018
- Staining your clothes.
- Helen.

30:56.800 --> 30:58.423
I'm not worried about anything.

30:59.880 --> 31:01.818
We have an amazing house.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.958
We're down to just two kids.

31:03.959 --> 31:05.756
They're happy at school.

31:05.757 --> 31:07.657
We're finally all unpacked.

31:08.170 --> 31:10.826
You promised me, when we got
out here, you'd take it easy.

31:10.827 --> 31:12.471
And I seriously am...

31:13.683 --> 31:14.999
going to.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.249
- When?
- Today.

31:16.692 --> 31:18.344
Chief Surgeon Ullah.

31:18.846 --> 31:19.886
Mmm.

31:21.500 --> 31:22.756
Say that again.

31:23.459 --> 31:25.666
Chief Surgeon Ullah.

31:25.667 --> 31:27.708
Ooh. Oh.

31:27.709 --> 31:28.875
Guys.

31:28.876 --> 31:30.166
Gross.

31:30.167 --> 31:31.291
Buzzkill.

31:58.059 --> 31:59.351
Helen.

31:59.352 --> 32:00.585
Huh?

32:01.500 --> 32:02.545
You okay?

32:03.366 --> 32:04.416
Yeah.

32:04.417 --> 32:05.458
Fine.

32:07.757 --> 32:08.757
Okay.

32:10.167 --> 32:12.483
Sollomanders, let's rock and roll!

32:14.417 --> 32:16.101
Yeah, Stacey, come on.

32:16.102 --> 32:17.561
Coming.

32:40.605 --> 32:42.249
Have you figured out
who her mother is yet?

32:42.250 --> 32:44.306
Think she looks a little like
Michelle Pfeiffer, you think?

32:45.375 --> 32:46.417
Not really.

32:51.928 --> 32:54.499
- Geena Davis?
- Why don't you just ask her?

32:54.500 --> 32:56.671
Why don't you? You spend so
much time looking at her.

32:57.673 --> 33:00.417
No, that would be you, Helen.

33:07.230 --> 33:10.316
Do you think she even realizes
these cans are hers, not ours?

33:10.317 --> 33:13.490
No, I don't. And she's not going
to if you keep moving 'em for her.

33:16.261 --> 33:17.374
Hey there.

33:17.375 --> 33:18.622
Good morning.

33:19.461 --> 33:20.790
Morning.

33:21.713 --> 33:23.027
Are those mine?

33:23.028 --> 33:25.163
Yeah, but don't worry
about it. I got it.

33:28.083 --> 33:29.750
So, tell me,

33:29.751 --> 33:32.030
what are you going to do to relax today?

33:32.031 --> 33:33.342
Go to therapy.

33:33.343 --> 33:34.742
That just makes you hate your mother.

33:34.743 --> 33:35.810
I already hate my mother.

33:35.811 --> 33:37.833
And besides, this is different.
It's West Coast therapy.

33:37.834 --> 33:39.291
Very chill.

33:43.417 --> 33:44.709
- Bye.
- Bye.

33:45.276 --> 33:46.557
- You guys ready?
- Yep.

34:01.690 --> 34:03.150
I've got a negative balance.

34:03.717 --> 34:06.777
I'm sorry. Uh, can you say
that again? I didn't hear you.

34:06.778 --> 34:09.641
I said I'm standing here in
checkout at the school cafeteria,

34:09.643 --> 34:11.541
and I've got a negative
balance on my food card.

34:11.542 --> 34:15.362
Um, okay, well, it-it's
your father's month to pay.

34:15.362 --> 34:16.949
Did you try to call him?

34:16.949 --> 34:18.998
So you want me to hang
up, try to call him,

34:19.000 --> 34:20.603
then wait around for
him to call me back?

34:20.603 --> 34:22.563
I'm trying to get breakfast
so I can get to class.

34:22.563 --> 34:24.077
Okay, sweetheart, I'm sorry.

34:24.078 --> 34:26.545
I'll-I'll take care of it.
Give me three minutes, okay?

34:26.547 --> 34:27.583
Thanks, Mom.

34:27.583 --> 34:30.375
Oh, God, Noah. I swear to fucking God.

34:32.239 --> 34:33.846
So, um,

34:34.431 --> 34:36.433
let's try scanning your body, huh?

34:37.612 --> 34:39.226
Take a deep breath.

34:40.150 --> 34:41.614
Scan your body.

34:42.126 --> 34:44.081
And tell me where
you're feeling tension.

34:56.123 --> 34:57.243
Nothing?

35:01.112 --> 35:02.217
I'm fine.

35:03.831 --> 35:05.207
But this morning,

35:05.208 --> 35:07.208
you thought you felt an earthquake?

35:09.833 --> 35:10.872
That's right.

35:11.352 --> 35:12.594
A big one.

35:13.979 --> 35:17.041
Why don't we try that
body scan one more time?

35:17.042 --> 35:18.875
Dr. Kaplan, I'm sorry, I'm just really

35:18.876 --> 35:20.642
not used to doing therapy this way.

35:20.643 --> 35:23.413
In New York, we-we
talked. We didn't scan.

35:25.531 --> 35:27.033
You still miss New York?

35:29.198 --> 35:30.403
Getting easier?

35:31.709 --> 35:32.740
Um, yeah, I guess.

35:32.741 --> 35:34.132
I guess so. I guess it is.

35:36.333 --> 35:38.370
I don't know. I just feel, um...

35:40.497 --> 35:42.744
...um, uncomfortable here.

35:42.745 --> 35:45.352
This town, it makes me feel unsafe.

35:46.239 --> 35:47.337
Okay.

35:47.779 --> 35:48.980
Unsafe how?

35:49.548 --> 35:51.925
Well, like, for example, when's
the earthquake gonna hit?

35:53.751 --> 35:54.970
Which particular earthquake?

35:54.971 --> 35:57.316
The big one. The one that's
gonna kill all of us.

35:57.317 --> 35:59.014
I mean, why are we all existing here

35:59.015 --> 36:01.131
on a fucking fault line
just waiting to die?

36:01.132 --> 36:03.154
Doesn't that seem insane to you?

36:03.875 --> 36:06.093
Okay, so what I'm hearing is...

36:07.161 --> 36:08.673
this town, this place,

36:08.674 --> 36:11.549
it really makes you feel unsafe.

36:14.548 --> 36:16.032
Yes, I just said that.

36:16.950 --> 36:18.922
Yes, but now I feel

36:18.923 --> 36:21.881
I understand the magnitude
of your concern.

36:23.838 --> 36:25.255
Was that an earthquake joke?

36:25.655 --> 36:27.568
Why don't we try scanning your body

36:27.569 --> 36:30.404
- one more time just to see if we...
- I think my son might be gay.

36:33.431 --> 36:35.151
Oh, okay.

36:35.760 --> 36:38.847
Perhaps there's your earthquake.

36:39.424 --> 36:40.674
What?

36:40.675 --> 36:42.643
The earthquake in your life

36:42.644 --> 36:44.492
that you so greatly fear.

36:44.493 --> 36:45.653
I'm fine with it.

36:46.746 --> 36:47.839
I am.

36:47.840 --> 36:49.964
I am 100% fine with it.

36:49.965 --> 36:51.172
I'm thrilled, actually.

36:51.173 --> 36:52.631
I always wanted a gay son.

36:52.632 --> 36:54.715
My other son is like Gary Cooper.

36:54.716 --> 36:56.256
It's awful.

36:57.699 --> 36:59.047
It's awful because...?

36:59.048 --> 37:00.685
It's his father I'm worried about.

37:01.745 --> 37:03.972
Your son's father, your ex?

37:04.664 --> 37:06.673
Uh, yeah. He's not very, uh...

37:07.709 --> 37:08.839
tolerant.

37:08.840 --> 37:09.919
Ah.

37:11.671 --> 37:14.506
And I'm afraid he's gonna
think it... it's his fault.

37:14.507 --> 37:15.549
His fault?

37:17.632 --> 37:19.298
For not being around
when Trevor was young.

37:19.299 --> 37:20.349
For leaving us.

37:20.350 --> 37:22.006
You're afraid your ex-husband

37:22.007 --> 37:23.506
will consider your son's sexuality

37:23.507 --> 37:25.839
a result of his poor choices?

37:25.840 --> 37:27.257
Yeah.

37:29.386 --> 37:32.177
You know, of course, that's
not how sexuality works.

37:33.881 --> 37:35.920
Well, I didn't say I thought that.

37:36.780 --> 37:38.907
I said I was afraid he might think it.

37:41.236 --> 37:44.797
Um, how are you and Noah doing?

37:45.538 --> 37:47.310
Uh, last session, you were having

37:47.311 --> 37:50.131
mixed feelings about his
being out here at all.

37:50.132 --> 37:52.000
It's fine. We're fine.

37:52.001 --> 37:54.095
Uh, it's-it's good for
the kids to see him.

37:54.096 --> 37:56.258
I don't have any problems
with Noah anymore.

37:56.259 --> 37:59.319
It's just, uh... uh...

37:59.716 --> 38:01.821
- What?
- He annoys me.

38:06.590 --> 38:07.590
Huh.

38:10.469 --> 38:13.356
You seem uncomfortable
talking about Noah.

38:13.357 --> 38:16.018
Physically uncomfortable.

38:16.019 --> 38:17.212
Do you notice that?

38:20.005 --> 38:21.615
Helen, if I may.

38:22.082 --> 38:26.089
I see you relying on your head a lot

38:26.846 --> 38:30.506
to rationalize or even
deny certain feelings.

38:31.275 --> 38:33.770
You don't seem incredibly aware,

38:34.229 --> 38:38.125
appreciative of the intelligence,

38:38.865 --> 38:40.568
the experience,

38:41.136 --> 38:42.262
the trauma

38:43.132 --> 38:45.724
that is hiding in your body.

38:47.765 --> 38:49.110
What trauma?

38:52.757 --> 38:54.965
Uh, your husband left you abruptly

38:54.966 --> 38:57.433
after 25 years of marriage,

38:57.434 --> 39:01.732
then hit his new wife's
brother-in-law with a car,

39:01.733 --> 39:03.132
fled the scene

39:03.133 --> 39:06.381
and ended up going to
prison for three years.

39:06.382 --> 39:07.441
Meanwhile,

39:07.442 --> 39:10.631
your older son failed out
of two high schools,

39:10.632 --> 39:12.131
barely graduated,

39:12.132 --> 39:14.445
and your daughter dropped out

39:14.446 --> 39:16.629
of college to run off to Paris

39:16.630 --> 39:19.816
with a man twice her
age, who abused her.

39:22.719 --> 39:24.674
I mean, well, when you
put it like that...

39:29.257 --> 39:32.464
I left all of that behind me
when I came to California.

39:32.465 --> 39:35.565
I have literally nothing
to worry about right now.

39:37.757 --> 39:38.881
Whitney's back in school.

39:38.882 --> 39:41.172
She has an age-appropriate
boyfriend who she likes.

39:41.173 --> 39:42.673
And I like him, too.

39:42.674 --> 39:45.381
And Martin seems happy
at William and Mary.

39:45.382 --> 39:47.964
And the younger kids
really like school here.

39:47.965 --> 39:50.995
And Vik has an amazing job.

39:50.996 --> 39:52.643
And we live in a gorgeous house.

39:52.644 --> 39:55.180
Oh, and my parents are 3,000 miles away.

39:55.181 --> 39:57.506
I don't have to work right
now if I don't want to,

39:57.507 --> 40:00.006
and it's sunny every
day. Every goddamn day.

40:00.007 --> 40:02.673
Every goddamn day is sunny... perfect.

40:02.674 --> 40:05.048
But you know what, sometimes
the sun gives me a headache.

40:05.049 --> 40:06.950
And I fucking hate this ocean.

40:07.481 --> 40:09.438
- You hate the Pacific?
- Yeah.

40:10.003 --> 40:12.061
There's nothing you can do

40:13.258 --> 40:15.381
when you're around it except look at it.

40:15.382 --> 40:17.735
It's so huge and blue and obvious.

40:17.736 --> 40:19.443
It's like an attention whore.

40:19.444 --> 40:21.964
The ocean is... is an attention whore?

40:21.965 --> 40:24.172
Okay, no, when you say it like
that, it makes me sound crazy.

40:24.173 --> 40:25.474
That's not what I was trying to...

40:25.475 --> 40:26.506
I know, but never mind. It's all right.

40:26.507 --> 40:28.117
Just, you don't get it. Never mind.

40:35.433 --> 40:37.893
You know, I think this would
be a really good time

40:37.894 --> 40:41.146
to just try closing your eyes

40:41.147 --> 40:43.382
- and holding your breath...
- Fuck you, Ezra.

40:53.267 --> 40:54.465
Priya?

40:55.787 --> 40:57.622
I'm almost done.

40:59.056 --> 41:01.798
Vik didn't tell me that
you were coming over.

41:01.799 --> 41:03.800
He told me his pants are falling down,

41:03.801 --> 41:05.257
so I'm taking them in.

41:07.623 --> 41:11.631
Um, well, I could have
taken care of that.

41:11.632 --> 41:13.131
Do you know how to sew?

41:13.843 --> 41:16.214
No, but I could've, um...

41:16.215 --> 41:18.256
you know, dropped 'em off somewhere.

41:18.257 --> 41:19.848
At a tailor's?

41:20.788 --> 41:21.921
Yeah.

41:22.965 --> 41:24.480
I am a tailor.

41:26.094 --> 41:28.590
I know. I just... I didn't
want to bother you, so...

41:28.591 --> 41:32.089
Why would it bother me to do
something nice for my son?

41:32.090 --> 41:35.326
Does it bother you to care
for your children, Helen?

41:37.865 --> 41:39.423
Can I get you something?

41:39.424 --> 41:40.964
Uh...

41:40.965 --> 41:43.131
we have, um, water, juice.

41:43.132 --> 41:45.553
I think we have some club soda.

41:46.362 --> 41:47.381
Wow.

41:48.757 --> 41:50.054
His favorites.

41:50.055 --> 41:51.464
Baingan bharta,

41:51.465 --> 41:54.037
chicken tikka, chole bhature.

41:54.625 --> 41:57.423
I've even brought Indian bread... naan.

41:57.424 --> 41:59.081
It's in your freezer.

41:59.082 --> 42:00.289
Don't put it in the oven.

42:00.290 --> 42:01.831
It'll get crusty.

42:01.832 --> 42:03.539
Put it in the microwave

42:03.540 --> 42:05.908
and heat it in a frying pan.

42:05.909 --> 42:07.288
He can take the leftovers

42:07.289 --> 42:09.027
for lunch to work.

42:09.660 --> 42:11.831
I really don't know what to say.

42:12.555 --> 42:15.283
There's plenty for you
and your children, too.

42:15.975 --> 42:18.581
You really didn't have to do this.

42:18.582 --> 42:21.501
I mean, there's enough
food in there for a week.

42:21.502 --> 42:23.415
I don't mind doing it every Sunday.

42:23.416 --> 42:25.503
- I know you're busy.
- Well, I'm not that busy.

42:25.504 --> 42:26.957
I have time to cook.

42:30.177 --> 42:31.455
What?

42:31.456 --> 42:33.473
Vikram is very skinny.

42:33.474 --> 42:34.694
I know.

42:34.695 --> 42:36.377
I think he's stressed out.

42:36.378 --> 42:38.431
Um, about his new job.

42:38.432 --> 42:39.808
Perhaps.

42:39.809 --> 42:41.908
Or perhaps he's simply not

42:42.477 --> 42:44.942
accustomed to the food you cook.

42:45.895 --> 42:48.020
A husband should be fat.

42:48.021 --> 42:50.151
It shows he's happy.

42:53.279 --> 42:56.330
Oh, I think Vik's happy, Priya.

42:56.331 --> 42:57.700
I mean, I...

42:58.957 --> 43:00.497
I think I make him happy.

43:01.129 --> 43:03.039
That's what he tells me.

43:03.681 --> 43:05.555
Of course, no man is truly happy

43:05.556 --> 43:07.860
until he has children of his own.

43:13.686 --> 43:15.143
Um...

43:15.144 --> 43:16.512
Okay, will you excuse me?

43:16.513 --> 43:18.388
I have to do something.

44:40.950 --> 44:42.042
Oh, hi.

44:42.043 --> 44:44.998
- Helen?
- Hi. Yes. Sierra, right?

44:44.999 --> 44:46.933
- Yeah, that's right.
- How's it going?

44:46.934 --> 44:48.936
Great, actually. I, uh...

44:48.937 --> 44:51.463
I have been picking these
literally all morning,

44:51.464 --> 44:53.691
and I just realized that I-I never

44:53.692 --> 44:55.310
really welcomed you guys, so...

44:55.311 --> 44:56.527
Well, thank you.

44:56.969 --> 44:59.318
Wow, this room is great, by the way.

44:59.319 --> 45:02.247
Thanks. Uh, just... come in.

45:02.248 --> 45:03.652
Who's your, uh...

45:03.653 --> 45:05.056
who's your interior person?

45:05.057 --> 45:06.897
Oh, I'm my interior person.

45:06.898 --> 45:09.071
Wow, this is a lot of avocados.

45:09.072 --> 45:10.608
Oh. Yeah.

45:10.609 --> 45:12.205
I, uh... I mean, I was never gonna

45:12.206 --> 45:13.512
eat all of those on my own.

45:13.513 --> 45:15.581
But my mom actually has
this amazing guac recipe

45:15.582 --> 45:16.789
- on her blog.
- Oh, right, your mom.

45:16.790 --> 45:18.363
What is the name of her blog again?

45:18.364 --> 45:21.455
I'll send it to you.
You have amazing skin.

45:21.456 --> 45:23.831
- Oh.
- No, seriously.

45:23.832 --> 45:25.789
Like, I was just gonna
tell you about this mask

45:25.790 --> 45:27.414
that you can make with the avocado

45:27.415 --> 45:28.849
that, like, literally sucks the toxins

45:28.850 --> 45:30.922
out of your skin, but I
feel like maybe you already

45:30.923 --> 45:32.747
- do something like that.
- No.

45:32.748 --> 45:34.361
- No, you're glowing.
- Oh.

45:34.362 --> 45:36.609
Well, thank you.

45:39.251 --> 45:41.831
Okay, well, um, I'll go.

45:41.832 --> 45:43.794
- Okay.
- I-I did just want to say

45:43.795 --> 45:46.998
that if you ever wanted, like,
you know, a workout buddy

45:46.999 --> 45:49.716
or a drinking buddy, I do both a lot.

45:50.124 --> 45:51.593
Great. Thank you.

45:51.594 --> 45:54.017
Have you ever tried goat yoga?

45:54.018 --> 45:55.956
Goat yoga? No.

45:55.957 --> 45:58.414
Oh, my God, it's yoga
but with baby goats.

45:58.415 --> 45:59.724
- Really?
- Yeah.

45:59.725 --> 46:02.210
They, like, massage you
with their little hooves.

46:02.211 --> 46:04.553
So it might be fun if we
wanted to do it together.

46:05.211 --> 46:06.586
Well, thank you.

46:06.587 --> 46:07.932
That would be nice. Thanks.

46:08.569 --> 46:10.726
I'm so glad that you guys moved in here.

46:11.253 --> 46:14.005
Really, because the last people

46:14.006 --> 46:17.211
were really... cold, you know.

46:17.212 --> 46:19.597
They had a very stagnant energy.

46:19.598 --> 46:21.154
They were Scandinavian.

46:21.155 --> 46:22.697
Oh.

46:23.431 --> 46:24.532
But you...

46:27.276 --> 46:29.361
Your being is, like...

46:31.082 --> 46:32.170
it's a little...

46:35.540 --> 46:36.836
It is?

46:38.284 --> 46:40.128
Yeah, I don't know. I-I
guess we'll find out.

46:43.496 --> 46:44.702
Okay.

46:51.581 --> 46:52.581
Bye.

47:07.894 --> 47:08.894
Nice school.

47:09.921 --> 47:11.329
Apparently.

47:12.373 --> 47:14.402
I am disappointed there's
no particle accelerator.

47:15.550 --> 47:19.498
I'm sure they'll have a...
capital campaign to buy one.

47:23.873 --> 47:25.579
Maybe he's just running late.

47:25.580 --> 47:27.607
Maybe he found something better to do.

47:28.885 --> 47:31.165
Why do you still let him get to you?

47:34.092 --> 47:35.378
I don't know.

47:42.457 --> 47:44.304
- There's Trevor.
- Mmm.

47:51.383 --> 47:52.565
Hi.

47:53.167 --> 47:55.347
You're Trevor's parents, aren't you?

47:55.348 --> 47:56.487
Uh, well, I'm...

47:56.488 --> 47:58.622
You guys have such a wonderful son.

47:58.623 --> 48:01.581
Oh. Did you hear that, Vik?
We have a wonderful son.

48:01.582 --> 48:02.784
Thank you.

48:02.785 --> 48:05.205
Yeah, we really think so, too.

48:05.206 --> 48:07.394
And you guys, of course, know Brooklyn.

48:07.395 --> 48:09.594
Um, we know about Brooklyn

48:09.595 --> 48:11.834
more than we know him,
but yes, of course.

48:11.835 --> 48:13.619
They're joined at the hip, those two.

48:13.620 --> 48:15.036
Totally inseparable.

48:15.037 --> 48:16.831
- Mm-hmm.
- Which...

48:16.832 --> 48:18.259
I want you guys to know,

48:18.260 --> 48:20.073
we totally support here in every way.

48:20.074 --> 48:21.360
This is a safe environment

48:21.361 --> 48:23.567
in which Trevor can
fully express himself.

48:24.636 --> 48:26.594
Anyway, great to see you,

48:26.595 --> 48:27.831
and great to have Trevor with us.

48:27.832 --> 48:29.323
He's truly special.

48:30.082 --> 48:31.200
Thanks.

48:40.068 --> 48:41.817
So he's gay, right?

48:41.818 --> 48:43.379
As the day is long.

48:44.249 --> 48:46.232
Do you think that kid made that robot

48:46.233 --> 48:48.671
by himself really, or did
his parents help him?

48:48.672 --> 48:51.205
- What the fuck, Helen?
- Noah, where were you?

48:51.206 --> 48:53.164
I don't know what kind
of sick game you're

48:53.165 --> 48:54.914
fucking playing here, but
those are my kids, too,

48:54.915 --> 48:56.873
and if you ever try to box me
out of their lives again...

48:56.874 --> 48:58.747
Box you out of their
lives? You didn't show up,

48:58.748 --> 49:00.121
- and suddenly that's my fault?
- You didn't put my name

49:00.122 --> 49:01.307
on the fucking list.

49:01.308 --> 49:02.393
What list? I don't even know...

49:02.394 --> 49:05.039
Okay, stop. That's enough.
Your kids are coming, guys,

49:05.040 --> 49:06.398
so what do you want to do?

49:06.399 --> 49:07.862
How do we want to play this?

49:14.317 --> 49:17.330
You're saying you
actually think the producers

49:17.331 --> 49:19.570
of Fun Home would give you the rights

49:19.571 --> 49:21.137
to direct a student production?

49:21.138 --> 49:23.349
Yeah. Me and Brooklyn.

49:23.350 --> 49:24.873
You think I can't do it?

49:24.874 --> 49:26.669
I know you can do it.

49:26.670 --> 49:30.122
It's just a matter of your
convincing the producers.

49:30.123 --> 49:31.664
Because, really, who are you?

49:31.665 --> 49:32.956
You're just some kid.

49:32.957 --> 49:34.728
I have good ideas.

49:34.729 --> 49:37.081
So practice your pitch on me first.

49:37.082 --> 49:38.984
You only get one chance
with these people.

49:38.985 --> 49:40.706
I can tell you the parts that need work.

49:40.707 --> 49:42.125
You would do that?

49:42.126 --> 49:43.539
You have to make an appointment first.

49:43.540 --> 49:45.392
- I'm a very busy person.
- Okay, okay.

49:45.393 --> 49:47.497
I'll have Brooklyn's mom call your mom.

49:47.498 --> 49:49.283
- That'll be fine.
- Yeah.

49:50.463 --> 49:52.873
You know, I, um...

49:52.874 --> 49:55.951
I really like Brooklyn a lot.

49:59.082 --> 50:00.748
Yeah, I know you do.

50:04.889 --> 50:06.347
And I'm really glad.

50:07.667 --> 50:10.007
And I think Vik is glad about that, too.

50:12.984 --> 50:14.091
You know...

50:14.915 --> 50:18.332
if I can be honest with you guys,

50:18.333 --> 50:21.747
sometimes I think I might be...

50:21.748 --> 50:22.870
Oh, God.

50:22.871 --> 50:24.083
So sorry I'm late.

50:24.084 --> 50:26.506
This fucking traffic. Jesus.

50:26.507 --> 50:28.691
Oh, can I take that?
Put that on our tab.

50:28.692 --> 50:30.065
Thanks.

50:30.066 --> 50:32.247
Hey, little man. You okay?

50:32.248 --> 50:33.659
What were you talking about?

50:33.660 --> 50:35.127
Nothing.

50:35.128 --> 50:37.331
- Hi, Dad.
- Hi.

50:39.123 --> 50:41.082
Can I talk to you?

50:55.882 --> 50:58.122
- What the hell's going on?
- Martin called me today.

50:58.123 --> 50:59.863
You forgot to fill his food card.

51:00.529 --> 51:01.810
Is it my month?

51:01.811 --> 51:03.414
- I'm sorry.
- You know, I am really trying,

51:03.415 --> 51:06.330
but you are not the center of
the fucking universe, Noah.

51:06.331 --> 51:08.122
Oh, for fuck's sake,
Helen, not this again.

51:08.123 --> 51:09.289
Do you know what you just
blundered into out there

51:09.290 --> 51:12.029
like a... like a bull in a china shop?

51:12.616 --> 51:16.915
Trevor was about to tell us he's gay.

51:17.998 --> 51:19.358
- What?
- Yes.

51:19.359 --> 51:21.611
I-I-I'm... I'm pretty sure

51:21.612 --> 51:24.622
he was about to tell Vik and
me that he thinks he's gay.

51:25.644 --> 51:27.382
Well, okay.

51:27.383 --> 51:28.522
Good for him.

51:28.523 --> 51:29.619
We're happy for him, right?

51:29.620 --> 51:30.747
Yes, of course we're happy for him.

51:30.748 --> 51:32.998
I just wanted him to be able to tell us.

51:32.999 --> 51:35.164
Which he was trying to do,
and then you showed up.

51:35.165 --> 51:36.658
Okay, well, I didn't know.

51:36.659 --> 51:38.518
So let's go back out
there, and maybe he'll...

51:38.519 --> 51:39.914
No, don't you see what happened?

51:39.915 --> 51:41.759
You walk in, and he just shuts down.

51:41.760 --> 51:43.562
And you come in, and you're
angry, and you're swearing,

51:43.563 --> 51:45.202
and you're grabbing beers,
you're eating chips and...

51:45.203 --> 51:46.766
It's a Mexican restaurant.

51:47.413 --> 51:49.081
He is intimidated by you.

51:49.082 --> 51:51.122
- That's ridiculous.
- He's afraid to tell you.

51:51.123 --> 51:52.818
Well, maybe if he spent
more time with me...

51:52.819 --> 51:54.466
He's afraid you're gonna
think it's your fault.

51:54.467 --> 51:55.618
Why would I think it's my fault?

51:55.619 --> 51:58.179
- Because it is.
- What?

51:58.180 --> 52:00.330
- Trevor being gay is my fault?
- No. Shut up.

52:00.331 --> 52:02.039
- That's not what I said.
- It is what you said.

52:02.040 --> 52:03.330
Well, it's not what I meant.

52:03.331 --> 52:04.912
Well, what the fuck did you mean, Helen?

52:04.913 --> 52:06.578
I...

52:06.579 --> 52:07.685
Is that what you think?

52:07.686 --> 52:08.946
If that's what you really think,

52:08.947 --> 52:10.873
then you've got really weird ideas

52:10.874 --> 52:12.360
about how people become gay.

52:13.582 --> 52:15.285
Oh, my God, it's you.

52:18.082 --> 52:19.610
You're the earthquake.

52:19.611 --> 52:20.869
I'm the what?

52:20.870 --> 52:22.765
You're the other fucking shoe.

52:23.932 --> 52:26.438
You're the reason why I
can never ever relax.

52:26.439 --> 52:28.051
Because every time I see you,

52:28.438 --> 52:31.247
I am just waiting for the
next disaster to happen.

52:33.299 --> 52:35.027
Jesus Christ, Helen.

52:37.247 --> 52:39.390
That's a little unfair
to me, don't you think?

52:42.999 --> 52:44.603
No, I don't.

52:49.414 --> 52:52.221
You know, years ago, you
broke our family apart,

52:52.222 --> 52:55.966
and now I finally have a
new life in a new place.

52:55.967 --> 52:58.867
The only problem is you're still in it.

53:01.998 --> 53:03.921
Well, what do you want me to do, Helen?

53:04.834 --> 53:06.487
Not see my kids?

53:06.488 --> 53:08.188
'Cause that's not gonna happen.

53:08.189 --> 53:09.436
No, I understand.

53:14.237 --> 53:15.518
I...

53:18.129 --> 53:20.629
I think we should just try
to stay away from each other

53:20.630 --> 53:22.255
as much as possible.

53:28.111 --> 53:29.351
Okay.

53:32.873 --> 53:33.970
Okay.

54:27.096 --> 54:28.129
Hey.

54:29.895 --> 54:32.169
Five more minutes. It's
pretty late, okay?

54:32.170 --> 54:33.782
- Okay, Mom.
- Okay, good night.

54:33.783 --> 54:35.206
Good night.

54:42.540 --> 54:44.406
- Hi.
- Hey.

54:46.309 --> 54:49.374
I was thinking maybe we could
take a few days and...

54:49.974 --> 54:51.387
go up to Big Sur.

54:52.059 --> 54:53.547
I've never been there.

54:53.548 --> 54:55.608
It's supposed to be,
like, God's country.

54:55.609 --> 54:57.711
Huh. Sounds awful.

54:59.507 --> 55:00.627
Yeah.

55:01.054 --> 55:03.419
I'll switch some things around,
try to clear a weekend.

55:03.993 --> 55:06.624
I'd love to have you to
myself for a few days.

55:10.502 --> 55:15.638
You know, I think I'm actually
starting to understand

55:15.639 --> 55:17.632
why people like L.A.

55:21.434 --> 55:23.445
What do you think about that?

55:25.498 --> 55:26.498
Vik.

55:27.450 --> 55:28.450
Vik!
