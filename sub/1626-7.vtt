carrying an iPad Mini.

00:05.093 --> 00:07.962
Or is it an iPad
carrying a mini Han?

Han has a mini iPad?

I am so upset.
I'm stuck in a lie.

00:19.810 --> 00:23.104
Well, it's better than the time
you got stuck in that backpack.

00:23.105 --> 00:25.774
Seriously, you guys.
I'm in trouble.

00:25.775 --> 00:29.477
I just opened this email, and
my mother is coming to visit.

00:29.478 --> 00:32.380
You have a mother?

00:32.381 --> 00:36.851

a kid in a toy store made a wish.

Han, your mother's coming all
the way from Korea to see you.

00:51.212 --> 00:55.028
- Isn't that great news?
- Is this the face of great news?

00:56.851 --> 00:59.520
See, my mother thinks
I have a girlfriend.

00:59.521 --> 01:01.889
My father still thinks
I wasn't in the car

01:01.890 --> 01:05.025
when my friend hit
that grifter in the Hamptons.

01:05.025 --> 01:09.363
She thinks I have a girlfriend
because I might have told her I did.

my mother pictures of someone

the woman I'm dating.

Han, you might have
catfished your mom?

I might have.

01:29.250 --> 01:30.851
Catfishing...
Right.

01:30.852 --> 01:32.419
That's when you pick up
a woman in a bar,

she has whiskers.

P.S....
Doesn't bother me.

01:41.262 --> 01:43.664
No, catfishing is
when you pretend

to be someone you're not
on the Internet.

01:45.533 --> 01:47.401
You know, like everyone

She's not a prostitute.
She has a website.

to relax your rectum.

02:20.902 --> 02:24.872
It says she's an exotic dancer
at this gentlemen's club in Manhattan.

02:24.873 --> 02:28.142
So just go there and hire the hooker
to pretend to be your girlfriend.

to wait in the alley

Oh, I understand.

03:05.090 --> 03:06.424
Just one question...

03:06.425 --> 03:10.428
Did I or did I not let you have
the cupcake window rent-free?

03:10.429 --> 03:13.564
Wow, Han.
That's a cheap shot.

03:13.565 --> 03:16.634
Low, bitchy...
I respect that.

03:17.833 --> 03:19.236
We'll go to the strip club,

I am leaving, leaving, leaving.

who wants to ride?

will be riding, <i>per se</i>.

someone or my bosses will fire me.

And then it's back
to waiting tables.

that low again.

so he sent his mother pictures of you
and said you were his girlfriend.

I think it's her turn.

06:38.734 --> 06:40.769

he's willing to pay you
to pretend to be his girlfriend.

06:43.639 --> 06:48.376

how to do that with my hips.

a great stripper.

no package, so that sounds perfect.

was unrealistic

didn't need an air pump.

How are you ever going to pull this off?

of my two best friends?

it's gonna be brief.

take it off now.
