00:18.185 --> 00:20.085
- You know,
Dad is set in his ways.

00:20.187 --> 00:21.954
He's a Landry.

00:22.056 --> 00:25.858
Whatever he thinks
is the way he wants it to go.

00:25.960 --> 00:27.826
He knows most of what
he's talking about,

00:27.928 --> 00:32.865
but sometimes
we might know something.

00:32.967 --> 00:34.967
Me and Chase, you know,
we younger.

00:35.069 --> 00:36.368
We do things differently.

00:36.470 --> 00:38.937
We try to work smarter
instead of harder

00:39.040 --> 00:42.408
and try to, you know, make
things easy on ourselves.

00:42.510 --> 00:44.376
Dad's still stuck
in them old ways.

00:44.478 --> 00:46.945
And I'm sure my son
will be sitting right here

00:47.048 --> 00:48.347
saying the same thing
about me.

00:48.449 --> 00:50.682
And, hopefully,
one day that tradition

00:50.785 --> 00:52.084
and this whole Landry deal

00:52.186 --> 00:55.320
will be carried on
for 20 to 30 years from now.

01:03.931 --> 01:07.599

¶ Born on the bayou ¶

01:37.465 --> 01:40.866
- As dawn breaks
in southern Louisiana,

01:40.968 --> 01:46.638
only one week remains
in the gator hunting sean.so

01:46.740 --> 01:48.574
In Myette Point,

01:48.676 --> 01:52.177
after his boys only bagged
one gator yestdaery

01:52.279 --> 01:53.712
while he was helping
Mr. Roy,

01:53.814 --> 01:56.849
Troy needs
to kick it into high gear

01:56.951 --> 02:00.219
to fill his remaining
118 tags.

02:00.321 --> 02:03.188
- Yesterday, Mr. Roy
called me for help,

02:03.290 --> 02:05.958
and there's no way on earth
I could turn him down.

02:06.060 --> 02:09.026
Now we are way behind.

02:09.130 --> 02:12.464
- But the King of the Swamp
has a plan.

02:12.566 --> 02:14.133
He's counting on
a secret spot

02:14.235 --> 02:15.934
to pull in big numbers.

02:16.036 --> 02:18.070
- This honey hole

02:18.172 --> 02:20.706
could get us back on track,
hopefully.

02:22.676 --> 02:24.710
- Pole's straight up.

02:27.281 --> 02:28.514
- Oh, the pole's moving.

02:28.616 --> 02:30.282
I just saw the pole move.

02:37.558 --> 02:39.691
- Oh, oh.

02:39.793 --> 02:41.059
No, Pa, slack.

02:41.162 --> 02:42.161
- The pole move?

02:42.263 --> 02:44.129
- Oh, yeah, the pole moved.

02:53.140 --> 02:55.874
- Be careful.

02:55.976 --> 02:58.577
First line, babyWh! oo!

02:58.679 --> 03:01.280
- A nice little alligator.
- Yeah, hell, yeah.

03:01.382 --> 03:04.016
Oh, yes, indeed!

03:09.456 --> 03:11.390
- Ooh! I don't know
if I'm ready.

03:22.603 --> 03:24.469
[ gunshot ]

03:29.009 --> 03:30.175
What the hell?

03:30.277 --> 03:31.343
We're off to a good start,
buddy.

03:31.445 --> 03:32.811
First line,
we got a alligator.

03:32.913 --> 03:35.013
What the hell we want
better than that?

03:35.115 --> 03:39.751
- But Troy's excitement
quickly turns to concern.

03:39.853 --> 03:42.387
- Oh! [ whistles ]

03:42.489 --> 03:44.489
- Look how wide that is.

03:46.927 --> 03:50.028
- This gator has been mauled
by a monster.

03:50.130 --> 03:52.764
- Big alligators
are real territorial,

03:52.866 --> 03:53.966
and it happens often

03:54.068 --> 03:55.834
when you have a big alligator
in the area,

03:55.936 --> 03:57.603
he'll eat smaller gators.

03:57.705 --> 04:02.040
But we just picked up
a alligator that was big,

04:02.142 --> 04:03.609
and he had teeth marks.

04:03.711 --> 04:05.143
I could stick my finger
in 'em.

04:05.246 --> 04:07.346
- Yeah, look, we can put
several fingers in there.

04:07.448 --> 04:10.482
- Them big alligators
are just like cannibals.

04:10.584 --> 04:12.084
I mean,
they'll eat their own.

04:12.186 --> 04:14.419
If he can kill them,
he's gonna eat tm.he

04:14.521 --> 04:15.887
- We gotta
get him out of here.

04:15.990 --> 04:17.755
Pull up right here.
I'm gonna go toss a line.

04:17.858 --> 04:20.358
Make this happen.

04:23.063 --> 04:25.464
- Man, I wanna
catch him bad.

04:27.067 --> 04:31.336
- As the King of the Swamp
hunts down his cannibal gar.to..

04:37.077 --> 04:41.280
To the east
in the marsh near Houma,

04:41.382 --> 04:46.718
the Molineres begin their day
with a sense of urgency.

04:46.820 --> 04:50.656
- Right now, we're probably
a couple of days behind.

04:50.758 --> 04:54.459
- After RJ spent a few rough
days fishing on his own

04:54.561 --> 04:56.328
and didn't catch much...

04:58.866 --> 05:03.135
This season,
RJ finds himself

05:03.237 --> 05:05.971
more reliant on his son
than ever before.

05:06.073 --> 05:07.306
- When I was younger

05:07.408 --> 05:10.275
and I was out there
by myself, it was great.

05:10.377 --> 05:13.945
But now, thank God
I have Jay Paul.

05:17.518 --> 05:18.917
- Yeah, the line's down.

05:19.019 --> 05:21.653
The line's down,
but I don't see nothing.

05:25.159 --> 05:27.392
- Oh, yeah, man.
We got one.

05:27.494 --> 05:30.262
- Oh, yeah,
he went up on land.

05:30.364 --> 05:31.563
He's not the boss,

05:31.665 --> 05:35.867
but I give him the reins
because he became a man

05:35.969 --> 05:38.403
and he can take care
of things.

05:40.307 --> 05:41.473
- I feel like
in the last couple of years,

05:41.575 --> 05:42.541
I've had to take the reins.

05:42.643 --> 05:45.344
Dad's slowly
passing the torch over.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.318
- Oh, yeah, I see it.

05:54.988 --> 05:57.389
- Oh, dude. Come on, boy.
Come on, boy.

05:57.491 --> 05:58.924
- I'm a little sharper,
a little keener.

05:59.026 --> 06:00.125
Don't get me wrong.

06:00.227 --> 06:02.027
He's still strong as hell,
but guess what?

06:02.129 --> 06:03.662
He will slip up
a little bit.

06:13.173 --> 06:16.375
- With the gator hidden
in the thick gssra,

06:16.477 --> 06:18.043
Jay Paul and his dad

06:18.145 --> 06:20.579
use a gaff to try
and dig out the line

06:20.681 --> 06:23.815
and stir the beast
out of its lair.

06:30.290 --> 06:31.723
- Be careful.

06:40.434 --> 06:43.502
- Come on, dude.
Come on, boy.

06:43.604 --> 06:45.003
There he goes.
There he is, there he is.

06:46.206 --> 06:47.739
- Watch out, man.
Watch your hand!

06:58.385 --> 06:59.551
- Watch out!

07:00.821 --> 07:02.521
[ gunshot ]

07:07.628 --> 07:09.694
- It's a tag filled,

07:09.797 --> 07:11.163
but a six-foot gator

07:11.265 --> 07:14.366
will only bring in $120
at the buyers,

07:14.468 --> 07:16.301
hardly worth their time.

07:16.403 --> 07:18.437
- All right, go!

07:18.539 --> 07:23.508
- As the Molineres push hard
to turn things aroun..d.

07:26.814 --> 07:30.682
30 miles east in Amelia,

07:30.784 --> 07:33.618
Jacob and Chase
are desperate to make up

07:33.720 --> 07:36.788
for yesterday's disaster
after Chase overslept

07:36.890 --> 07:40.158
and the boys only filled
a single tag.

07:44.631 --> 07:47.165
- Where you was at
this morning?

07:47.267 --> 07:49.768
- Oh, my God.
- That's Chase.

07:49.870 --> 07:51.903
You know, he's single, he's
young, he's not responsible.

07:52.005 --> 07:54.606
I'm really, really,
you know, pissed off.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.942
I never hesitate
to give him any crap

07:57.044 --> 07:59.711
because, believe me,
if he has the opportunity,

07:59.813 --> 08:02.180
he gives it
right back to me.

08:02.282 --> 08:04.749
- Missed.

08:04.852 --> 08:05.917
- Whatcha doin dg,ude,

08:06.019 --> 08:07.652
swinging that thing
right by me like that?

08:07.754 --> 08:09.621
What if I'd have moved right
before you'd a done that?

08:09.723 --> 08:11.456
- I know you wouldn't of.
I was watching you.

08:11.558 --> 08:13.225
You was only starting out
your knot.

08:13.327 --> 08:15.360
If you'd have been finishing
your knot, I would've waited.

08:15.462 --> 08:17.796
- It's inevitable
every year.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.398
Jacob is mad at me
over something silly.

08:20.501 --> 08:22.200
Sometimes when I'll sleep
through the alarm.

08:22.302 --> 08:27.105
I think to waste time
fighting or, you know, being mad

08:27.207 --> 08:29.107
when it ultimately
gets done,

08:29.209 --> 08:30.208
then it shouldn't matter.

08:31.912 --> 08:34.011
Over there in the water.

08:34.114 --> 08:35.480
Is that one?

08:35.582 --> 08:37.616
- Mm-hmm.

08:37.717 --> 08:40.751
- Knowing they need to bag
a big loadod tay,

08:40.854 --> 08:44.022
Chase decides the best
strategy to fill the boat

08:44.124 --> 08:46.858
and get back
on his brother's good side

08:46.960 --> 08:49.794
is to snipe gators.

08:49.897 --> 08:52.030
- Given the circumstances

08:52.132 --> 08:54.766
that Jacob and I haven't caught
all the gators we ne,ed

08:54.868 --> 08:57.435
I suggested that
we gonna start riding around

08:57.538 --> 08:59.971
and looking for gators in
open water with the rifle.

09:00.073 --> 09:02.240
- Sniping is a quicker way
to hunt,

09:02.342 --> 09:06.077
avoiding the time it takes
to travel, set lesin,

09:06.179 --> 09:08.413
and wait for the gators
to take the bait.

09:08.515 --> 09:10.982
But it's also a lot riskier.

09:11.084 --> 09:12.517
- Chase
has got to get a shot.

09:12.619 --> 09:13.985
You know, here we are
running behind,

09:14.087 --> 09:15.387
and we have tags to fill.

09:26.867 --> 09:30.368
- The boys race
to retrieve the beast...

09:32.005 --> 09:34.005
- Before it sinks
to the bottom.

09:34.107 --> 09:35.273
- Right there.

09:37.711 --> 09:40.478
No, right here.

09:40.581 --> 09:42.180
- What the [ bleep ]?

09:42.282 --> 09:43.882
- I don't see it.
You see it?

09:43.984 --> 09:46.151
All rit.gh

09:49.289 --> 09:51.456
I started worrying, and
it starts making you think

09:51.558 --> 09:53.558
in the back of your mind,
did he miss it?

10:02.268 --> 10:04.869
- In Amelia, Louisiana,

10:04.971 --> 10:07.905
far behind
in their tag count,

10:08.008 --> 10:11.309
Chase is frantically
trying to snag the beast

10:11.378 --> 10:13.478
he shot at moments ago.

10:13.546 --> 10:15.646
- I don't see it.
You see it?

10:25.291 --> 10:27.091
- Pretty bad.

10:28.628 --> 10:30.928
- I don't see it.

10:32.932 --> 10:35.033
- You know, I took a shot
when I shouldn't have

10:35.101 --> 10:40.872
and I ended up missing
a big alligator.

10:40.940 --> 10:43.207
and anytime I miss
or, you know, a bad shot

10:43.309 --> 10:45.243
or I lose one,
it  just sticks with me.

10:45.345 --> 10:47.178
It felt good
when I shot him.

10:47.280 --> 10:49.013
I mean,
I thought I smoked him.

10:53.086 --> 10:56.854
- Frustrated, Chase continues
to search for the gator.

10:56.956 --> 10:58.122
- Over there.

11:01.861 --> 11:05.029
- Oh, God,
we lost the treble hook.

11:05.131 --> 11:06.798
- Oh, my God.

11:06.866 --> 11:10.635
- But to make matters worse,
the knot's come undone

11:10.737 --> 11:13.337
and the treble hook
has slipped off the rope.

11:13.406 --> 11:15.239
- We didn't have another
treble hook in our boat,

11:15.308 --> 11:16.307
and we needed one.

11:16.409 --> 11:17.475
- [ bleep ]

11:17.577 --> 11:18.743
If we're going to shoot
a big alligator

11:18.845 --> 11:20.545
with the rifle,
we need a treble hook.

11:20.647 --> 11:22.914
That is a key
to the success of it.

11:23.016 --> 11:24.549
It's gotta be somewhere
right there, though.

11:24.651 --> 11:26.317
I can get out
and feel for it.

11:29.856 --> 11:32.457
We started feeling around
with that pole,

11:32.559 --> 11:35.760
because any time metal hits
metal, it's gonna make noise.

11:38.131 --> 11:39.964
[ clank ]

11:40.066 --> 11:42.467
- Hey, right here.
Reach down there.

11:50.743 --> 11:53.177
- I got my hand in the water
trying to find this treble hook,

11:53.246 --> 11:56.481
and we kinda forgot all about
the nine or ten-foot alligator.

11:59.619 --> 12:00.885
Sticking your hand
in the water

12:00.987 --> 12:02.887
not knowing where it's at
is pretty dangerous,

12:02.989 --> 12:04.989
and that alligator
could be ready to bite.

12:17.337 --> 12:18.769
- Yes.
- Bingo.

12:18.872 --> 12:19.904
- Awesome.

12:19.973 --> 12:21.172
- Yeah, buddy.

12:21.241 --> 12:24.041
Luckily we wasn't
in that deep of water,

12:24.144 --> 12:25.877
so I was able
to feel and find it.

12:25.979 --> 12:28.446
And then after that, we put
a good knot on the hook.

12:28.548 --> 12:30.815
- Kind of like finding
a needle in a haystack.

12:30.884 --> 12:32.783
- Chase does a lot of things
before thinkg.in

12:32.886 --> 12:36.220
I think before I do,
he do before he think.

12:36.322 --> 12:38.956
I want him to redeem himself
for strolling in late,

12:39.058 --> 12:40.691
losing the treble hook,
and whatnot.

12:45.098 --> 12:49.000
- As Chase and Jacob
try to get back on track...

12:54.607 --> 13:00.178
53 miles north in Gonzales,

13:00.280 --> 13:03.948
Glenn Guist
is also on shaky ground.

13:04.017 --> 13:06.617
- Well, this old house,
it's been here,

13:06.719 --> 13:10.254
man, as long, longer
than when I was born.

13:10.356 --> 13:14.625
And Daddy built this maybe,
60, 70 years, I guess now.

13:19.732 --> 13:21.766
I was sitting in my chair
watching TV

13:21.834 --> 13:24.302
with my feet in the water.
[ laughs ]

13:24.370 --> 13:26.804
About ankle deep.

13:26.906 --> 13:29.640
- This is my first time
doing this, Glenn.

13:29.742 --> 13:31.242
I can't lie to you.

13:31.344 --> 13:33.811
I think I understand
the concept of it.

13:33.913 --> 13:36.180
- With help
from his friend Todd,

13:36.282 --> 13:39.483
Glenn plans to prop up
and level out his sinking hoeus

13:39.586 --> 13:42.019
using cement pillars
and shims.

13:48.828 --> 13:50.628
For the foundation,
like the piers,

13:50.730 --> 13:51.729
they'll start sinking.

13:51.831 --> 13:53.598
Man, they got
a couple of them

13:53.666 --> 13:55.666
is almost
sunk out of sight.

13:55.768 --> 13:57.868
- You want me
to spot you? No?

13:57.937 --> 14:00.037
- I got it.
[ groans ]

14:08.181 --> 14:09.213
I was like thihes re

14:09.315 --> 14:11.315
sitting
trying to watch TV, man.

14:11.417 --> 14:13.784
[ laughs ]

14:13.853 --> 14:15.920
First thing,
you gotta get you a shovel

14:16.022 --> 14:17.622
'cause you're gonna have
a little bit of digging to do.

14:17.690 --> 14:19.490
Kinda level the ground out.

14:19.592 --> 14:21.359
Then you get you some pads.

14:21.461 --> 14:22.760
Then you get you
some bcklos.

14:22.862 --> 14:25.263
Then you find you
some jacks.

14:25.331 --> 14:26.697
Man, that's about it.

14:26.766 --> 14:28.499
And you just
go from there, man.

14:30.470 --> 14:34.438
- Easy, old house.
Easy, gal.

14:34.507 --> 14:37.408
- Jacking up this old house,
it could fall ov.er

14:37.510 --> 14:39.343
- You know what the word
precarious means?

14:39.412 --> 14:40.444
- No, what that mean?

14:40.513 --> 14:42.079
- It means hanging on by a--

14:42.148 --> 14:43.614
- Thread?
- Yeah.

14:43.683 --> 14:45.416
- Okay.
[ chuckles ]

14:45.518 --> 14:50.254
- Out of some old scrap wood
he found lying arod,un

14:50.323 --> 14:54.325
Glenn's cutting the shims
swamp style.

15:19.952 --> 15:24.355
- As Glenn and Todd attempt
to stay in one piece...

15:27.093 --> 15:28.926
Back on Myette Point,

15:28.995 --> 15:32.897
needing to pull in
a big load today,

15:32.999 --> 15:36.701
Troy and Guy are trying to
fend off a cannibal gator

15:36.803 --> 15:38.736
that's ruining their haul.

15:38.805 --> 15:40.805
- Hey, it's down,
but it's slack, brother.

15:54.620 --> 15:56.687
- Ho!

15:58.257 --> 16:00.558
- He was eaten alive.

16:00.626 --> 16:04.628
- Once again, the vicious
monster has struck.

16:04.731 --> 16:06.964
- When you catch an alligator
on a line,

16:07.066 --> 16:08.432
the other big ones
in the area,

16:08.534 --> 16:10.701
they hear him making
splashes in the water

16:10.803 --> 16:12.269
and they think
he caught food.

16:12.372 --> 16:15.039
So they rush over to take
the food away from him,

16:15.108 --> 16:17.375
but he's hooked on a line,
so they'll kill him.

16:17.443 --> 16:20.010
That might be him
right there swimmi.ng

16:21.481 --> 16:22.913
This cannibal gator

16:23.015 --> 16:24.548
is just trying
to put us out of business.

16:24.650 --> 16:26.851
Every alligator
that he inrus

16:26.919 --> 16:28.486
is hitting me in my wallet.

16:28.554 --> 16:29.887
It's costing me money now.

16:29.989 --> 16:33.991
- Although this gator won't
earn a cent at the buyers,

16:34.093 --> 16:37.094
by law they must tag
every gator they catch.

16:37.196 --> 16:38.729
- This gator
was eaten in hf.al

16:38.831 --> 16:40.064
- It's unbelievable.

16:40.166 --> 16:41.832
That has to be a monster.

16:41.934 --> 16:43.401
- Oh, yeah.
I tell you what.

16:43.469 --> 16:45.002
We need to catch
that rascal.

16:45.104 --> 16:46.637
- To lure in the canbanil,

16:46.739 --> 16:49.407
the King of the Swamp
has an idea.

16:53.946 --> 16:55.179
- Okay.

16:55.281 --> 16:58.616
- Rubbing our bait all over
the ones he's chewed on

16:58.718 --> 17:02.119
and putting that smell
on our bait...

17:07.660 --> 17:09.059
All right, you hung her up?

17:09.127 --> 17:10.227
- Yep.

17:10.329 --> 17:13.631
- The Landry trap is s.et

17:13.733 --> 17:18.702
Meanwhile, back in the marsh
near Houma,

17:18.771 --> 17:26.810
knowing they need to make up
a lot of ground today,

17:26.878 --> 17:28.846
- Do you see the line
orha wt?

17:28.948 --> 17:30.314
- I don't see it.

17:30.416 --> 17:32.450
I'm 50-plus years old now.
You know what I'm saying?

17:32.518 --> 17:35.085
So I think I've slowed down
a little bit.

17:35.154 --> 17:36.854
But with Jay Paul's help,

17:36.956 --> 17:38.622
he's not gonna
let me slow do.wn

17:38.691 --> 17:41.392
But he's scared
that I'll give up

17:41.494 --> 17:43.727
and say I don't wanna
do this no more.

17:43.796 --> 17:47.264
- I see the line going
in the grass on that side.

17:47.333 --> 17:48.666
- That's good.

17:50.203 --> 17:51.735
- It's hard to see my dad
slow down

17:51.838 --> 17:53.237
because I know
how much he has done

17:53.339 --> 17:54.839
and what he's capable
of doing.

17:54.941 --> 17:56.006
I'm not counting him out,

17:56.075 --> 17:57.608
but at the same time,
he is getting older.

17:57.710 --> 17:58.709
He's slowing down.

18:18.764 --> 18:20.030
- Watch out, bro. Look o!ut

18:28.183 --> 18:32.319
- RJ and Jay Paul
are battling an angry bet.as

18:39.228 --> 18:41.395
- Watch out, bro. Look out!

18:50.739 --> 18:51.805
[ gunshot ]

18:59.181 --> 19:01.715
- This six-footer
brings the day's total

19:01.817 --> 19:04.551
to eight small gators
so far.

19:04.653 --> 19:06.920
And judging by his dad's
energy level,

19:07.022 --> 19:10.490
Jay Paul knows they need
to pick up the pace.

19:10.592 --> 19:13.560
- Every year it seems like I'm
pushing him harder and harder.

19:13.662 --> 19:15.595
He's getting older,
and sometimes I feel bad

19:15.698 --> 19:17.864
because I might get
a little amped up on him.

19:17.967 --> 19:18.966
Come on, Dad, what the hell
you doing?

19:19.068 --> 19:20.133
Come on, man,
what're you doing?

19:30.746 --> 19:36.216
- 30 miles west in Amelia,

19:36.318 --> 19:38.585
trying to make up
for lost time,

19:38.687 --> 19:40.320
Jacob and Chase

19:40.422 --> 19:43.724
are on the hunt for gators
in the open water.

19:43.826 --> 19:47.060
But so far, Chase missed
his one clear shot

19:47.162 --> 19:48.829
at sniping a monster.

19:48.931 --> 19:50.397
- We got one here, Jacob.

19:50.499 --> 19:53.266
Oh, big alligator.
Big, big gator.

20:06.815 --> 20:09.449
- Typicay llif the boat's still
and the motor's off,

20:09.551 --> 20:12.185
any little movement in the boat
can make the boat rock,

20:12.287 --> 20:14.354
and that makes your crosshairs
just go all over the place

20:14.456 --> 20:16.056
so you can't get steady
on an alligator.

20:16.158 --> 20:20.027
But if Jacob stays idling
with the motor in forward

20:20.129 --> 20:22.162
but just barely gives it
enough gas

20:22.264 --> 20:24.131
to take the vibration
out of the boat,

20:24.233 --> 20:25.932
then my shot
will be as still

20:26.035 --> 20:28.201
as if I was standing
on dry ground.

20:32.674 --> 20:34.674
There's an extreme amount
of pressure

20:34.777 --> 20:36.910
whether, you know,
I hit it or I miss it

20:37.012 --> 20:38.779
because
I lost our opportunity

20:38.881 --> 20:40.313
to put a big alligator
in the boat.

20:42.418 --> 20:44.051
[ gunshot ]

21:02.905 --> 21:03.804
- Get the gun. Hurry up.

21:03.906 --> 21:05.806
- With the gator hooked,

21:05.908 --> 21:08.075
it's up to Jacob
to finish the job.

21:08.177 --> 21:09.409
- Damn!

21:09.511 --> 21:11.278
Oh, he's mad.
Jumping  iatt.

21:12.881 --> 21:14.214
Watch that tail.

21:19.188 --> 21:21.254
[ gunshot ]

21:24.159 --> 21:27.194
- As Chase
hauls in their pri..ze.

21:27.296 --> 21:28.195
- What the [ bleep ]?

21:28.297 --> 21:30.430
- He makes a startling
discovery.

21:30.532 --> 21:32.132
Hu- h?

21:32.234 --> 21:33.767
- I didn't hit
this alligator.

21:33.869 --> 21:35.168
Look at m.hi

21:42.177 --> 21:43.977
[ both laugh ]

21:44.079 --> 21:45.512
- We got two in one!

21:45.614 --> 21:47.881
- Today we had something
I've never seen before.

21:47.983 --> 21:50.617
We shot one,
and we started getting close,

21:50.719 --> 21:52.052
so we treble hooked it
and we shot him.

21:52.154 --> 21:53.687
Got him in the boat
and realediz

21:53.789 --> 21:55.755
that it's not even
the alligator that we shot.

21:55.858 --> 21:57.157
He was just trying
to get away.

21:57.259 --> 21:58.792
- Yeah, this is him.

21:58.894 --> 22:00.293
- Then we look around

22:00.395 --> 22:02.596
ad here's the alligator
that I had just shot floating.

22:04.967 --> 22:06.566
- That's what you call
being productive.

22:06.668 --> 22:08.802
I did a lot
of two for one deals,

22:08.904 --> 22:10.470
but never two alligators
like that.

22:10.572 --> 22:12.806
[ both laugh ]

22:12.908 --> 22:14.674
We've seen
a lot of crazy things,

22:14.776 --> 22:17.010
but that's never happened
once before ever.

22:17.112 --> 22:19.012
Several times a year
I think to myself,

22:19.114 --> 22:21.281
you know what, I'd probably
be a lot better off

22:21.383 --> 22:23.083
if I had somebody else
in the boat with me.

22:23.185 --> 22:25.986
And then, you know, we shoot
a big alligator on open water

22:26.088 --> 22:28.188
that I know I wouldn't do
with somebody else

22:28.290 --> 22:30.624
so, you know, and we
forget all about that.

22:30.726 --> 22:33.627
- You can check in, but
you ain't gonna check t.ou

22:38.967 --> 22:43.436
- 54 miles north
in Gonzales...

22:48.010 --> 22:50.744
As Glenn
and his friend Todd

22:50.846 --> 22:53.547
raise the Guist house
to level it out,

22:53.649 --> 22:56.249
they find some
archaeological relics.

22:56.351 --> 22:57.984
- When you're jacking up
a house,

22:58.086 --> 22:59.152
you find a lot of stuff

22:59.254 --> 23:00.620
you didn't know
they had up under there.

23:00.722 --> 23:01.621
- What is that, Glenn,

23:01.723 --> 23:03.757
an old part
of your time machine?

23:06.695 --> 23:11.131
- It look like a big Jolly
Green Giant dryer vent, huh?

23:11.233 --> 23:12.899
- [ chuckles ]

23:17.973 --> 23:20.273
- Look, bro, this might be
like a piece of pottery

23:20.375 --> 23:22.309
maybe from
the Choctaw Indians.

23:22.411 --> 23:23.677
Y'all didn't build
y'all house

23:23.779 --> 23:26.146
on some type of burial ground
or something, huh?

23:42.998 --> 23:44.231
- [ chuceskl ]

23:44.333 --> 23:45.932
I found an old gas tank

23:46.034 --> 23:48.501
I guess floated up
under there from the flood.

23:48.604 --> 23:50.937
A few pieces that looked
like windowpane glasses.

23:51.039 --> 23:52.439
I don't know how that
got under there.

23:52.541 --> 23:54.307
Aw, look at that
little snake, dude.

23:54.409 --> 23:55.442
- I see him.

23:55.544 --> 23:57.210
- What is it,
a copperhead or something?

23:57.312 --> 24:00.547
- A snake, dude.
He wasn't very big.

24:00.649 --> 24:02.882
I don't know what kind he was.
He was bro.wn

24:09.658 --> 24:12.826
I ain't killing.
Go find you another house.

24:17.432 --> 24:20.400
- As the boys continue
to dig up swamp history

24:20.502 --> 24:23.203
one small piece at a time...

24:25.440 --> 24:27.374
Back in Myette Point...

24:30.879 --> 24:33.013
Troy and Guy have stepped up
their efforts

24:33.115 --> 24:36.616
to catch the cannibal
that's destroying their gators.

24:36.718 --> 24:38.585
- Guy and I,
we figured out a way

24:38.687 --> 24:40.553
that we think
we can catch this gator.

24:40.656 --> 24:42.555
We took our bait
and we rubbed it

24:42.658 --> 24:44.791
all over the alligators
that was chewed up.

24:44.893 --> 24:47.160
Them gators
got a smell of their own.

24:51.300 --> 24:52.832
- It's tight, brother.

24:52.934 --> 24:54.100
- Tight?

24:59.341 --> 25:01.741
- Got something, Guy Landry.

25:07.182 --> 25:10.817
Ooh! Ooh!

25:11.953 --> 25:14.354
Whoo!

25:15.691 --> 25:17.457
Pop him, pop h!im

25:24.000 --> 25:26.200
- In Myette Point...

25:26.302 --> 25:28.102
Troy and Guy

25:28.204 --> 25:31.605
think they have their
cannibal monster on the line.

25:32.742 --> 25:33.874
- Ooh!

25:39.248 --> 25:41.649
Now! Shoot him!

25:46.956 --> 25:48.889
- Whoo! Yeah, ba.by

25:48.958 --> 25:50.524
Yeah, baby.
One, two, three.

25:51.961 --> 25:55.129
Oh, man. Not again.

25:55.231 --> 25:57.197
Look at the teeth mark.
Look at that.

25:57.300 --> 25:58.265
- Where he's at?

25:58.334 --> 26:00.067
I need the big gun
and I need it now.

26:00.169 --> 26:04.405
- As they pull the mutilated
gator into the boat,

26:04.507 --> 26:06.307
it's a familiar scene.

26:06.409 --> 26:09.443
The savage beast
has struck again.

26:09.512 --> 26:10.844
- I don't know
what's the dl.ea

26:10.947 --> 26:14.114
We got the smell of the gators
he's killed on our bait,

26:14.216 --> 26:16.550
and I thought sure
we was gonna catch him.

26:16.619 --> 26:18.252
But he's not falling
for our trick.

26:18.354 --> 26:20.387
He's way smarter
than we thought he was.

26:20.489 --> 26:23.857
- He's here, he's close,
and it's a big one.

26:23.960 --> 26:26.393
- Yeah. This cannibal gator,
I mean,

26:26.495 --> 26:28.295
it's at the point where
I don't know what  dtoo.

26:28.397 --> 26:29.730
I'm about
to pick up my lines

26:29.799 --> 26:31.065
and move to another area.

26:31.167 --> 26:33.567
But if I don't catch him,

26:33.669 --> 26:35.703
that means I gotta deal
with him again nexyet ar

26:35.805 --> 26:36.971
when I come to this area.

26:37.073 --> 26:39.373
All we can do is just
keep doing what we doing,

26:39.442 --> 26:42.376
rubbing our bait all over
the ones he's chewed on,

26:42.445 --> 26:44.545
and, hopefully, he'll fall
for it sooner or later.

26:44.613 --> 26:48.916
You just never know
with that [ bleep ]

26:48.985 --> 26:51.719
- As Troy and Guy presons

26:51.821 --> 26:55.589
with their boatload of
chewed up, worthless gators...

26:59.729 --> 27:04.098
Over in the marsh
near Houma,

27:04.200 --> 27:06.467
Jay Paul
is leading the charge

27:06.535 --> 27:08.802
as he and RJ race

27:08.904 --> 27:11.705
to make up for several
slow days on the water.

27:11.807 --> 27:14.108
- Jay Paul is upset
because I'm getting older,

27:14.176 --> 27:16.310
and, you know,
he's trying to keep me

27:16.379 --> 27:18.579
doing the things
that I love to do.

27:18.647 --> 27:22.549
And he knows once I stop,
I probably won't go back.

27:22.651 --> 27:25.819
- After a slow start
this morning,

27:25.921 --> 27:29.490
the Molineres now have 14 gators
in their boat.

27:29.558 --> 27:31.625
- He's by that big pile
of tall layered asgrs.

27:31.727 --> 27:35.729
- And with another line down,
they're looking for more.

27:37.633 --> 27:38.866
- He's a good one.
- Huh?

27:38.934 --> 27:40.034
- He's a good one.

27:40.102 --> 27:41.702
- Well, let him go.
Give him to me.

27:41.804 --> 27:44.271
I'll pull him to the boat.

27:51.113 --> 27:52.413
But it gets pretty tricky,

27:52.481 --> 27:53.580
'cause you never know
what it's gonna do.

27:55.117 --> 27:58.085
- What the...
Whoa, whoa, whoa!

27:58.187 --> 28:00.087
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

28:01.924 --> 28:04.591
Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
That's not good.

28:10.032 --> 28:12.299
- If they wait much longer,

28:12.401 --> 28:14.435
the gator
might pop the line,

28:14.503 --> 28:17.438
So RJ
instinctively takes over,

28:17.506 --> 28:21.408
stepping off the safety of
the boat to bag the beast.

28:31.487 --> 28:32.553
Okay, get ready, get ready.

28:37.493 --> 28:39.860
- Okay, he's looking
straight up, straight up.

28:39.962 --> 28:41.428
Get ready, get ready,
get ready.

28:49.738 --> 28:51.105
- Real dangerous.

28:51.207 --> 28:53.540
- He's 10.
- Oh, he's a good 10.

28:53.609 --> 28:55.509
I feel no different now

28:55.611 --> 28:57.878
than I felt
when I was 20 years old.

28:57.980 --> 28:59.213
Go   .

28:59.315 --> 29:02.182
- That's it, huh?

29:02.251 --> 29:05.452
I taught my son
to be a leader,

29:05.521 --> 29:07.254
and he's a hard worker.

29:07.323 --> 29:08.589
But he knows
down deep inside

29:08.691 --> 29:11.125
that as long as his dad
is alive,

29:11.227 --> 29:12.926
his dad's
still on that boat,

29:13.028 --> 29:14.161
I'm the shot caller.

29:17.166 --> 29:20.501
Until I say he takes over,
then he takes over.

29:27.076 --> 29:32.779
- Meanwhile, back in Amelia,

29:32.882 --> 29:36.116
the Landry boys are trying
to rake in a big haul

29:36.218 --> 29:38.352
by sniping in open water.

29:43.092 --> 29:44.791
- Big Boy McCoy.

29:44.894 --> 29:46.727
- Serious?
- Yeah.

29:46.829 --> 29:48.996
- Stop. Stop.
Let me get everything ready.

29:50.866 --> 29:52.432
Shooting off of the boat,

29:52.535 --> 29:54.368
you don't have much
of a target as it is.

29:54.470 --> 29:57.404
A gator's eyes and head only
sticks out maybe that much.

29:57.473 --> 29:59.239
But with the angle
of the shot

29:59.341 --> 30:01.408
is where it really
becomes tough.

30:01.510 --> 30:03.177
- Rey?ad

30:12.021 --> 30:13.520
[ gunshot ]

30:19.028 --> 30:20.861
[ gunshot ]

30:26.268 --> 30:27.634
- Slow down.

30:33.008 --> 30:34.641
I think he's up here.

30:36.278 --> 30:37.377
- That's it, Craig.

30:37.479 --> 30:39.646
- [ laug ]hs

30:45.287 --> 30:48.455
- Still alive, the beast
needs one more shot.

30:48.557 --> 30:50.290
[ gunshot ]

30:52.928 --> 30:54.194
- Got him, homie.

30:54.296 --> 30:57.731
- This nine-footer is their
biggest catch of the day,

30:57.833 --> 30:59.833
worth $250,

30:59.935 --> 31:03.403
and for Chase,
it's sweet redemption.

31:03.505 --> 31:05.606
- You know, me and Chase
have a lot of conflict.

31:05.674 --> 31:07.107
We got on a few,
tried to shoot.

31:07.209 --> 31:08.642
Chase just kept missing.

31:08.744 --> 31:10.611
He said his excuses
like normal,

31:10.679 --> 31:12.045
but he didn't give up,

31:12.114 --> 31:14.414
and that's really
what makes the difference.

31:14.483 --> 31:16.450
If you don't shoot at them
and try to catchhe tm,

31:16.552 --> 31:18.218
you'll never have them
in the boat.

31:26.262 --> 31:29.830
- In Amelia, Louiaisna,

31:29.932 --> 31:32.666
Jacob and Chase have their
biggest catch of the day

31:32.735 --> 31:34.535
in the palm of their hands.

31:48.551 --> 31:50.884
- Chase's quick reflexes

31:50.986 --> 31:57.257
just saved them a nine-foot,
300-pound, $250 gator.

31:57.359 --> 31:59.059
- I did not want to lose
this alligator.

31:59.161 --> 32:00.260
I couldn't lose him.

32:00.362 --> 32:02.496
So the only thing
I could think of

32:02.565 --> 32:03.797
to for sure get a hold on it

32:03.899 --> 32:05.832
was to pretty much
just grab it

32:05.935 --> 32:07.401
and bear hug it
to the side of the boat

32:07.469 --> 32:09.403
while Jacob got himself
in a situation

32:09.471 --> 32:10.737
where he could help.

32:10.839 --> 32:12.439
But I was not gonna lose
that alligator.

32:12.541 --> 32:14.641
- [ chuckles ]

32:14.743 --> 32:15.742
I seen
the look ihin s eyes

32:15.844 --> 32:17.444
like, holy crap,
this thing's so heavy.

32:20.182 --> 32:21.915
He just did it
out of pure instinct,

32:22.017 --> 32:23.584
'cause he didn't want
to lose this alligator

32:23.686 --> 32:24.885
no more than what I did.

32:24.954 --> 32:26.086
- What you got
over there, Dude?

32:26.188 --> 32:30.257
- A scooby snack.
- Great.

32:30.359 --> 32:32.159
- Celebratory M&Ms.

32:32.228 --> 32:33.894
Jacob and I
being brothers,

32:33.996 --> 32:35.329
we may not like each other
during the day

32:35.397 --> 32:36.763
while we're fishing
alligators,

32:36.865 --> 32:38.932
but when all is said and done,
we love each other to death

32:39.034 --> 32:41.768
and I'd take a bullet
for my brother any day.

32:50.145 --> 32:52.512
- Back in Gonzal..es.

32:59.321 --> 33:00.687
[ whines ]

33:02.925 --> 33:05.692
- Trying to raise his
leaning house of Louisiana

33:05.794 --> 33:10.030
to avoid flooding,
Glenn's still not satisfied.

33:10.132 --> 33:11.431
- I ain't the pickiest guy
in t wheorld,

33:11.500 --> 33:14.334
but sometimes, man, I like
to have it just right, dude.

33:14.436 --> 33:17.738
Well, look like it needs to come
up a little bit mo, rebrah.

33:17.840 --> 33:19.940
'Cause it ain't quite
up to the line yet.

33:20.042 --> 33:21.541
- You're nitpicking, man.

33:21.610 --> 33:23.277
You're gonna make a fuss
about what,

33:23.345 --> 33:25.579
a sixteenth, eighth of an inch
or something, man?

33:25.681 --> 33:27.981
Man, that's good, Glenn.
- No, brah.

33:29.418 --> 33:30.984
- Aye-yi-yi.

33:32.221 --> 33:35.155
- We not professionals,
but we did a good job.

33:41.330 --> 33:43.030
We need just to get it up
just a little bit

33:43.132 --> 33:45.132
where I can put one more
little shim under it.

33:55.511 --> 33:57.377
I needed to raise it up
a little bit.

33:57.446 --> 33:59.880
The jack is jacked up
all it can go.

33:59.982 --> 34:02.816
I got an idea how we might
get the rest of it.

34:04.887 --> 34:05.986
- Old school?

34:06.088 --> 34:08.722
- Yeah. You don't know
the old school way?

34:10.458 --> 34:12.458
- All right. I'll show you.

34:14.096 --> 34:16.596
Look, this piece of pipe
right here ought to work.

34:17.900 --> 34:18.799
- I'm gonna show you, brah.

34:18.900 --> 34:20.067
Just have
a little patience, man.

34:20.168 --> 34:21.368
- All right.

34:21.469 --> 34:23.402
- We're gonna stick it
under here like this.

34:23.505 --> 34:25.371
Me and you get on the end.

34:25.474 --> 34:26.739
Pry this down a little bit,

34:26.809 --> 34:28.875
see if we can't
pick it up a little bit.

34:30.446 --> 34:31.511
- Come on, Glenn.

34:31.612 --> 34:32.913
- How you gonna know
if you don't try?

34:33.014 --> 34:34.147
- All right. If you say try,
we can try.

34:34.248 --> 34:36.083
- Yep, let's try. Ready?

34:36.185 --> 34:38.217
All right, here we go.

34:38.286 --> 34:40.053
Oh, it's moving some, brah.

34:40.155 --> 34:41.388
- Is it moving at all?

34:41.456 --> 34:42.656
- Yeah, it's moving
a little bit.

34:44.025 --> 34:46.226
We need a little bit more
manpow, erbrah.

34:46.295 --> 34:49.362
- Well, this is all the manpower
we got, me and you.

34:49.465 --> 34:52.532
- Yeah, but we'll gather a few
of our other friends up, brah.

34:52.634 --> 34:54.333
See if they'll come help us.

34:54.436 --> 34:55.402
- Yeah, you tell them
to come over here

34:55.471 --> 34:56.536
and help us
level your house,

34:56.638 --> 34:58.672
ain't nobody
gonna come over here, man.

35:00.843 --> 35:02.309
- Ahh.

35:02.378 --> 35:04.745
- That's all we need, just
three or four more other people.

35:07.483 --> 35:11.084
- That's what we'll do.
Yeah, boy.

35:11.186 --> 35:13.153
- While Glenn devises a plan

35:13.222 --> 35:17.324
to con his friends
into some free labor,

35:17.393 --> 35:20.660
over in Myette Point,

35:20.763 --> 35:24.698
Troy and Guy
continue the hirunt

35:24.767 --> 35:26.166
for the elusive cannibal

35:26.268 --> 35:29.136
that's destroyed
much of today's catch.

35:29.204 --> 35:32.205
- This cannibal gator, I mean,
he's playing hardball right now.

35:32.307 --> 35:35.108
He's way, way smarter
than we gave him credit for.

35:40.783 --> 35:42.783
Oh, that was a good one.

35:42.851 --> 35:44.785
That was a good alligator.

35:47.189 --> 35:49.055
Gol.
- Where is it, Guy?

35:49.124 --> 35:50.524
- Brother,
it don't look tight?

35:50.592 --> 35:52.826
- Oh, look, the whole tree
is shaking!

35:52.928 --> 35:54.094
- That's a big one,
brother.

35:54.196 --> 35:56.329
Ooh.

35:58.233 --> 36:00.634
- There's no way
it's not a big one.

36:00.736 --> 36:03.136
Sure enough, we come
to one of the lines

36:03.238 --> 36:06.006
where we had put
alligator blood on our bait.

36:06.108 --> 36:08.475
And I hope we have him.

36:08.577 --> 36:10.811
- Damn right,
that's a big one.

36:10.879 --> 36:12.479
Ooh, look, brother.

36:12.581 --> 36:15.015
Look how they wore
that tree out, dude.

36:15.117 --> 36:17.517
Oh, he h'seavy.

36:17.619 --> 36:19.419
- Huh?
- He ihes avy.

36:24.026 --> 36:26.526
If he start fighting, he's gonna
pop the line like nothing.

36:28.297 --> 36:30.197
This is for real.

36:30.299 --> 36:31.965
Did you load it?

36:32.067 --> 36:33.366
- Yeah.

36:33.435 --> 36:36.002
- Dude, he feels
like a giant.

36:36.071 --> 36:39.940
He ain't coming up,
and I can't bring him up.

36:43.178 --> 36:46.313
- Now we got a problem
because this is a big rascal

36:46.381 --> 36:48.982
and we can't
get his head up.

36:53.522 --> 36:55.822
Shoot, shoot, shoot.
Huy rrup!

37:01.330 --> 37:02.829
- In Myette Point...

37:02.931 --> 37:04.764
- This is for real.

37:04.867 --> 37:08.101
- Troy and Guy
think they may finally have

37:08.203 --> 37:12.539
the savage cannibal they've been
chasing all day on their line.

37:22.184 --> 37:23.183
- Watch him.

37:28.724 --> 37:30.957
- Shoot!
- Get him up the.re

37:31.059 --> 37:33.059
- Shoot! Shoot him!

37:35.531 --> 37:36.796
- Shoot!
- Aah!

37:39.968 --> 37:42.269
- Shoot him, shoot him,
shoot.

37:43.438 --> 37:44.538
Shoot, shoot.

37:48.076 --> 37:49.376
Shoohit m!

37:49.478 --> 37:51.311
[ gunsho]t

37:56.285 --> 37:58.818
[ laughs ]

37:58.921 --> 38:00.754
- He's gonna be
11-foot, easy.

38:00.856 --> 38:02.422
- 11-foot.

38:02.524 --> 38:05.258
That's gonna be our
record breaker right there.

38:05.360 --> 38:07.794
One, two, three.

38:07.896 --> 38:10.096
On three. Ready?
One, two, three.

38:12.501 --> 38:14.634
- That's a big old
alligator, huh?

38:14.736 --> 38:18.438
His head is out of proportion
with the size of his body,

38:18.540 --> 38:20.740
he's got teeth that's
bigger than my fingers,

38:20.842 --> 38:22.242
and I know this isim h.

38:23.645 --> 38:26.446
Whoo. I don't know if it
was our guardianng ael

38:26.548 --> 38:28.348
that was watching over us,

38:28.450 --> 38:30.717
but everything
fell into place

38:30.819 --> 38:31.785
and we have him.

38:34.289 --> 38:37.157
- Although some
of their haul was ruined,

38:37.259 --> 38:42.028
this 12-foot monster
is worth almost $350...

38:42.130 --> 38:44.064
- Oh, yeah,
he was pulling, baby.

38:44.166 --> 38:48.568
- Bringing the Landry's
total to $2,200.

38:48.670 --> 38:51.137
Not such a bad day
after all.

38:51.240 --> 38:52.973
- We got a big one!

38:53.075 --> 38:55.442
This is the gator that's
been costing us a fortune

38:55.544 --> 38:57.944
eating alligators
on our lines.

38:58.046 --> 38:59.312
We was really struggling.

38:59.414 --> 39:01.514
But at the end of the day,
it's a big relief.

39:01.617 --> 39:04.184
We don't have to worry about
coming back here next year

39:04.286 --> 39:06.186
and putting up
with all this again.

39:06.288 --> 39:08.488
Hold on, brother.

39:17.266 --> 39:19.299
- Back in Gonzales...

39:23.605 --> 39:25.405
- Glenn has spent all day

39:25.507 --> 39:28.708
raising his house
to protect it from flooding.

39:28.810 --> 39:30.310
Just a quarter inch short,

39:30.412 --> 39:32.812
he needs some help
for the final push.

39:36.485 --> 39:39.052
- Oh, yeah, it's gonna
be good enough to eat.

39:39.154 --> 39:41.321
- So he's throwing
a jambalaya party

39:41.423 --> 39:43.657
to convince his friends
to lend a hand.

39:46.128 --> 39:48.762
- When somebody finds out
that you're cooking jambala,ay

39:48.864 --> 39:49.996
they gonna come, brah.
