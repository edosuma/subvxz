00:07.100 --> 00:10.600
Al? Hey, Allison?

00:11.866 --> 00:13.799
Are you hearing this?

00:21.800 --> 00:23.501
Ariel?

00:24.800 --> 00:26.501
What the...?!

00:27.400 --> 00:28.700
Whose baby is that?

00:29.000 --> 00:30.300
And where's Ariel?

00:30.300 --> 00:31.600
Joe, keep your voice down.

00:31.600 --> 00:33.401
Where's our daughter?

00:34.000 --> 00:36.599
She's right here.

00:36.600 --> 00:38.468
Ariel's right here.

00:44.300 --> 00:45.799
Oh, Joe.

00:45.800 --> 00:48.767
My God, Joe, it's Bridgette and Marie.

00:48.833 --> 00:50.799
It can't be.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.833
How is that possible?

00:53.200 --> 00:54.599
Allison.

00:54.600 --> 00:58.000
Come on, Al, help me make sense of this.

00:59.400 --> 01:02.066
I think maybe it's my fault.

01:02.300 --> 01:05.266
I've been wishing for it secretly.

01:11.700 --> 01:13.734
Okay. I get it.

01:14.100 --> 01:17.000
You're upset. But don't you think you're being a little bit immature?

So, listen...

01:35.900 --> 01:37.900
What do you think about having another baby?

02:33.700 --> 02:34.899
Bridgette!

02:38.800 --> 02:39.900
That's nice.

02:40.300 --> 02:41.533
She's practicing.

02:42.000 --> 02:44.000
Make it stop!

02:44.000 --> 02:46.099
I'm begging you to make it stop.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.799
Hey, she's your sister,

02:48.100 --> 02:50.099
she's been at this all of two weeks,

02:50.100 --> 02:51.633
and this is important to her.

02:51.699 --> 02:54.133
What she really needs is your encouragement.

02:54.200 --> 02:55.499
And she's got it.

02:55.500 --> 02:58.000
I'm encouraging her to stop.

03:00.000 --> 03:00.499
Great.

03:00.500 --> 03:03.433
I was just getting the hang of it, and the reed breaks.

03:04.700 --> 03:06.299
Bridge, okay, come over here.

03:06.300 --> 03:07.599
We'll get you another one.

03:08.200 --> 03:10.099
Have some breakfast.

03:10.100 --> 03:12.900
That really stinks. I wanted Mommy to hear me play.

03:12.900 --> 03:14.700
Don't worry about it. Mommy isn't even here.

03:14.767 --> 03:16.833
She got a ride with Detective Scanlon this morning.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.167
Do me a favor. Go get dressed.

03:18.234 --> 03:20.099
I'll make you something to eat in the car.

03:20.100 --> 03:22.400
And you promise that we'll go down to the music shop

03:22.400 --> 03:24.700
and get me a new reed right after school?

03:24.700 --> 03:26.999
Absolutely, I promise.

03:27.000 --> 03:28.634
Oh, Lee,

03:28.699 --> 03:30.800
she's so beautiful.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.034
Thanks.

03:34.900 --> 03:36.199
So, how's Lynn adjusting?

03:36.200 --> 03:37.899
There was no adjusting. It was instant.

03:37.900 --> 03:41.234
The second little Lee came into the world, bam, she was a mom.

03:41.401 --> 03:43.500
What is it with you women and kids? It's like a drug.

03:44.467 --> 03:46.100
It is pretty amazing.

03:46.600 --> 03:49.934
I woke up this morning convinced that I had to have another one.

03:50.201 --> 03:52.234
Oh, I don't know what came over mere.

03:53.400 --> 03:55.333
What did Joe have to say about that?

03:55.400 --> 03:57.700
Nothing. He pretended he was asleep.

03:57.700 --> 03:59.667
Yeah. Well, it's different for guys.

04:00.500 --> 04:01.699
It's an adjustment.

04:01.700 --> 04:03.834
A great adjustment; a fantastic adjustment;

04:03.901 --> 04:05.300
but an adjustment.

04:07.367 --> 04:08.834
Tomorrow night's date night.

04:09.001 --> 04:11.166
I finally convinced her to get a sitter,

04:11.233 --> 04:13.033
leave little Lee for a couple hours.

04:13.100 --> 04:14.667
Ooh! Big step.

04:14.734 --> 04:15.834
Are you excited?

04:15.901 --> 04:17.534
I'm excited. She's terrified.

04:17.600 --> 04:18.798
Detective, advise your 20.

04:18.800 --> 04:21.434
I've got a Code Two in Fountain Hills.

04:21.500 --> 04:24.499
So you woke up... uh, what time?

04:24.500 --> 04:26.300
6:45, give or take?

04:26.300 --> 04:27.734
The baby's just gone?

04:28.101 --> 04:30.967
Housekeeper's just vanished?

04:31.700 --> 04:33.799
He's not in the nursery, she's not in her room.

04:33.800 --> 04:35.000
Her room? She has a room?

04:35.066 --> 04:37.800
She stays here five nights a week

04:37.800 --> 04:41.200
in case the baby fusses or wakes up during the night.

04:41.700 --> 04:42.799
And his name is Bryce?

04:42.800 --> 04:44.166
Bryce, yes.

04:44.200 --> 04:47.499
And, uh, that's a very recent photo- last weekend.

04:47.500 --> 04:49.500
Here's a picture of Elizabeth.

04:50.700 --> 04:51.599
The housekeeper.

04:51.600 --> 04:54.200
You said her last name was, uh, Torres.

04:54.300 --> 04:55.300
Yes.

04:55.300 --> 04:56.801
And during the night, you didn't hear anything?

04:56.801 --> 04:58.800
Uh, the baby didn't cry or anything, so,

04:59.400 --> 05:01.733
you have no idea what time this happened?

05:02.000 --> 05:02.799
No.

05:02.800 --> 05:04.932
How about your wife? Did she hear anything?

05:04.999 --> 05:06.566
Obviously, no.

05:08.300 --> 05:09.299
So, is this it?

05:09.300 --> 05:10.933
Is it just you two?

05:12.000 --> 05:15.000
A forensic team and some more detectives are on their way.

05:15.000 --> 05:17.500
We'll get these to every media outlet in the area.

05:17.566 --> 05:20.267
We'll get a description of the car up on Amber Alert.

05:20.900 --> 05:22.299
Can I speak with Mrs. Carlo?

05:22.800 --> 05:23.599
Uh, of course.

05:23.600 --> 05:25.300
She was just... putting on some clothes.

05:25.300 --> 05:27.101
She'll be, uh... She'll be down in a minute.

05:27.300 --> 05:29.300
Is the nursery upstairs?

05:29.300 --> 05:29.699
Yes.

05:29.700 --> 05:31.234
Do you mind if I take a look?

05:32.500 --> 05:34.199
I'll be up in a bit.

05:34.200 --> 05:37.500
I'm gonna talk to the mother, and I want to be here when the rest of the cavalry shows up.

06:14.201 --> 06:17.201
Should I not be in here?

06:17.900 --> 06:20.500
I see you're wearing gloves.

06:20.601 --> 06:21.800
I shouldn't be in here, right?

06:21.800 --> 06:25.234
I might ruin some clues or something?

06:25.901 --> 06:27.299
Mrs. Carlo?

06:27.300 --> 06:29.200
Dana.

06:29.500 --> 06:31.034
You're with the police?

06:31.300 --> 06:32.599
My name is Allison.

06:32.600 --> 06:35.634
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

06:35.700 --> 06:37.699
We're gonna find him.

06:37.700 --> 06:39.499
Wherever she went, wherever she took him,

06:39.500 --> 06:40.767
w- we're gonna find him.

06:41.833 --> 06:43.799
I'm not worried.

06:43.800 --> 06:46.199
I mean, of course I'm worried, but...

06:46.200 --> 06:48.499
I also know that there's no one on the planet

06:48.500 --> 06:51.732
that loves Bryce as much as I do, except Elizabeth.

06:52.400 --> 06:53.500
She worships him.

06:53.501 --> 06:55.933
She lives for him, and that's how I know.

06:56.000 --> 06:57.534
That's how I know he's okay.

06:58.501 --> 07:01.334
But you do believe that she took him?

07:01.501 --> 07:05.100
Well, maybe she did, and maybe she didn't.

07:06.300 --> 07:09.066
I mean, maybe this is all a dream,

07:09.440 --> 07:11.439
a nightmare.

07:11.440 --> 07:12.799
In a little while, I'll wake up,

07:12.800 --> 07:15.400
and Elizabeth will be downstairs holding Bryce,

07:15.400 --> 07:18.300
and we'll sing songs and play games,

07:18.300 --> 07:20.567
and it'll just be another day.

07:23.400 --> 07:27.500
What do you think the chances are that this address for Elizabeth Torres is good?

07:28.000 --> 07:31.566
That we knock on the door, she opens it?

07:31.600 --> 07:35.933
That the baby's there, asleep peacefully in a laundry basket?

07:40.300 --> 07:41.833
Ms. Torres, it's the police.

07:42.200 --> 07:45.134
If you don't open up on the count of three, we're coming in.

07:45.200 --> 07:47.399
One...

07:47.400 --> 07:51.600
two... three.

08:56.000 --> 08:57.699
Okay, home before lunch.

08:57.700 --> 08:59.700
Nice work if you can get it.

09:02.466 --> 09:04.533
Allison, you okay?

09:04.600 --> 09:06.333
Yeah.

09:06.400 --> 09:08.733
No, I'm fine.

09:08.800 --> 09:10.199
Are you sure?

09:11.500 --> 09:14.534
It's that little baby. I can't get it out of my head.

09:14.901 --> 09:15.999
Don't worry.

09:16.000 --> 09:17.899
You know, something's got to give.

09:17.900 --> 09:19.734
There's got to be a ransom demand.

09:20.000 --> 09:21.200
Someone will spot this Elizabeth.

09:21.200 --> 09:23.333
Something will break. It always does.

09:54.300 --> 09:55.399
Hello.

09:55.400 --> 09:56.633
Hi. You're at home?

09:57.200 --> 09:59.733
I- I called your office, I called your cell.

10:00.100 --> 10:01.599
It's a long story.

10:01.600 --> 10:03.400
Are you okay? You sound upset.

10:07.500 --> 10:08.800
Do you hear that?

10:09.000 --> 10:11.000
Hear what?

10:12.300 --> 10:14.800
Nothing. I- I don't hear it now.

10:14.800 --> 10:16.200
Hey, listen, um,

10:16.266 --> 10:18.800
what music store did you rent Bridgette's clarinet from?

10:18.800 --> 10:22.200
I promised her that I'd get her a new reed on the way home from school.

10:22.633 --> 10:24.800
Marshall's. I got it at Marshall's.

10:27.167 --> 10:28.499
There it is again. Do you hear it?

10:28.500 --> 10:30.199
No.

10:30.200 --> 10:32.333
Marshall's, huh?

10:33.000 --> 10:36.400
Allison, are you all right?

10:37.900 --> 10:39.534
Allison?

10:39.900 --> 10:42.500
Yeah. Honey, I'm fine.

10:42.500 --> 10:44.601
I'll see you when you get home.

10:55.750 --> 10:57.750
Baby?

11:16.700 --> 11:18.767
Shh, I'm here now, honey.

11:19.000 --> 11:20.499
What do you want, honey?

11:25.600 --> 11:28.000
Something you want in the garage?

11:38.500 --> 11:39.734
It's the car.

11:45.300 --> 11:46.299
It's the car.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.300
You wanted to be in the car?

11:49.100 --> 11:53.367
Oh, my God, I'm talking to a picture.

11:58.600 --> 12:00.700
You want to go for a ride, don't you?

12:01.800 --> 12:02.899
Okay.

12:02.900 --> 12:05.700
Wait right here, I'm gonna get my purse and my keys.

12:10.400 --> 12:11.599
Bridge, what are you doing?

12:11.600 --> 12:12.399
Put that back!

12:12.400 --> 12:13.299
Don't play with that.

12:13.300 --> 12:14.933
- That's not yours.
- Okay.

12:16.700 --> 12:18.933
Come on, help me find a reed.

12:21.000 --> 12:22.099
Okay, what size are we looking for?

12:22.100 --> 12:24.434
One, one and a half?

12:38.868 --> 12:40.568
She with you two?

12:43.200 --> 12:45.199
How long has she been playing?

12:45.200 --> 12:46.734
What are you talking about?

12:46.800 --> 12:48.767
She can't play.

12:49.900 --> 12:53.800
Which house is it?

12:55.400 --> 12:56.400
What, did I pass it?

13:21.333 --> 13:24.500
Hello?

13:26.000 --> 13:28.066
Hello, is anybody home?

13:41.900 --> 13:44.700
I hope you know what you're getting us into.

13:46.700 --> 13:48.300
Hello?

13:50.200 --> 13:52.400
Is anybody home?

13:52.567 --> 13:55.399
I'm with the District Attorney's Office.

13:55.400 --> 13:58.699
I'd like to ask you some questions about a missing baby.

14:04.100 --> 14:06.399
What is it now?

14:06.400 --> 14:08.599
Baby?

14:08.600 --> 14:10.500
Baby?

14:10.567 --> 14:13.500
Keep crying, I'm gonna find you, I'm here!

14:25.000 --> 14:27.301
It's you, Bryce, isn't it?

14:33.600 --> 14:36.101
Come on, you gotta tell me how you did that.

14:36.168 --> 14:37.399
I don't know how I did it.

14:37.400 --> 14:39.299
Just leave me alone.

14:39.300 --> 14:42.899
Okay, one half hour of TV then homework, okay?

14:42.900 --> 14:43.899
Hi, I gotta talk to you.

14:43.900 --> 14:45.300
I need to talk to you, too.

14:45.300 --> 14:46.300
Okay, you first.

14:46.300 --> 14:48.399
No, no, no. You go. What's going on?

14:48.400 --> 14:51.299
Okay, I took the kids to an early dinner, like you suggested,

14:51.400 --> 14:53.367
but something happened in the music store.

14:53.400 --> 14:55.867
Something that makes absolutely no sense whatsoever.

14:59.900 --> 15:02.967
Now I'm thinking maybe you should go first.

15:06.600 --> 15:07.499
What is that?

15:07.500 --> 15:08.799
It's a baby!

15:08.800 --> 15:11.000
Yeah, no, I sussed that part out.

15:11.001 --> 15:12.001
What is it doing here?

15:12.400 --> 15:14.599
Come on, little sweetie.

15:14.600 --> 15:18.467
Oh, I don't even know how to start explaining this.

15:18.533 --> 15:22.299
Okay, well, any effort you make will be much appreciated.

15:22.300 --> 15:25.467
Right, well, the short version is his name is Bryce Carlo.

15:25.900 --> 15:30.201
His housekeeper kidnapped him this morning and I found him.

15:30.800 --> 15:32.999
Okay, and what?

15:33.000 --> 15:36.333
We're, like, waiting for the police to come get him?

15:37.100 --> 15:38.999
Allison?

15:39.000 --> 15:40.933
I haven't called the police.

15:41.000 --> 15:42.899
Because...?

15:42.900 --> 15:44.967
Because I'm not sure I'm supposed to.

15:45.800 --> 15:47.600
Oh, okay, yeah, I can help you with this.

15:47.600 --> 15:48.299
You're supposed to.

15:48.300 --> 15:50.134
No, you don't understand.

15:50.300 --> 15:52.699
There's something about this little boy.

15:52.700 --> 15:55.234
From the moment I heard that he was gone.

15:55.501 --> 15:57.299
From the moment I saw his picture,

15:57.300 --> 15:59.599
I knew I was supposed to look for him.

15:59.600 --> 16:01.100
I was supposed to find him.

16:01.167 --> 16:03.167
And now I think I'm supposed to keep him.

16:04.234 --> 16:06.099
Allison, he has parents.

16:06.100 --> 16:07.700
Yeah, I know, I met them.

16:07.700 --> 16:09.434
But they're probably frantic.

16:09.501 --> 16:13.200
Well, his father is concerned but his mother is oddly calm.

16:13.267 --> 16:15.833
What are you talking about, oddly calm?

16:15.900 --> 16:17.700
She's probably in shock.

16:17.766 --> 16:19.367
And what difference does that make?

16:19.400 --> 16:20.599
<i>It's her baby.</i>

16:20.666 --> 16:22.799
Just because you took him from a kidnapper

16:22.800 --> 16:24.799
doesn't make you any less of a kidnapper.

16:24.800 --> 16:26.600
No, you're wrong! You don't understand.

16:26.600 --> 16:28.633
He's supposed to be here; he's supposed to be with me.

16:29.800 --> 16:30.600
Oh, look!

16:30.600 --> 16:34.099
He's smiling! He knows I'm right!

16:34.100 --> 16:36.200
He's smiling, that's your proof?

16:36.200 --> 16:38.300
That's your answer, he's smiling?

16:38.300 --> 16:40.866
He's a baby! They all smile.

16:41.000 --> 16:44.666
That's standard equipment on a baby- that's what they do.

16:44.800 --> 16:48.599
Allison, people go to jail for this for a very long time.

16:48.600 --> 16:49.299
What are you doing?

16:49.300 --> 16:50.600
I'm trying to protect you from yourself.

16:50.800 --> 16:51.900
I'm gonna try and reach somebody-

16:51.966 --> 16:53.567
a friend on the phone- Scanlon or Devalos.

16:54.100 --> 16:56.034
Somebody who can take this baby

16:56.400 --> 16:57.599
back to its rightful parents.

16:57.600 --> 16:58.600
- No!
- Hey, yes!

16:58.800 --> 17:00.566
You already have children.

17:00.800 --> 17:05.000
And they don't want to only see you on visitor's day.

17:09.500 --> 17:11.400
- Hey.
- Hi.

17:11.900 --> 17:15.299
Sorry. I know I'm late, but it was so hard to leave her.

17:15.300 --> 17:17.499
She kept looking at me like I was abandoning her.

17:17.500 --> 17:19.300
I know it's tough,

17:19.800 --> 17:21.934
but it's good practice for next week, when you go back to work.

17:22.000 --> 17:24.098
Okay, and I don't want to think about that tonight.

17:24.099 --> 17:25.200
A drink for madam?

17:25.267 --> 17:26.965
Yeah. She will have a martini with...

17:27.599 --> 17:29.533
No, no, no. Breastfeeding, breastfeeding, breastfeeding.

17:29.600 --> 17:30.599
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

17:30.600 --> 17:33.400
We will have a bottle of your finest water.

17:33.400 --> 17:34.500
Thank you.

17:35.000 --> 17:36.599
So how'd she check out?

17:36.600 --> 17:37.699
Sorry. Who?

17:37.700 --> 17:38.599
The baby-sitter.

17:38.600 --> 17:39.699
You were gonna run her license.

17:39.700 --> 17:42.500
Lynn, she's 17. She's, uh, clean as a whistle.

17:42.500 --> 17:44.600
- What are you doing?
- I'm texting her.

17:44.900 --> 17:48.800
Baby's not used to getting milk from a bottle from a stranger.

17:49.900 --> 17:52.099
I just need to make sure everything's going okay.

17:52.100 --> 17:54.666
And would we like to hear the specials for tonight?

17:54.732 --> 17:57.233
Not me. I can't really eat anything.

17:57.300 --> 17:58.099
What?

17:58.100 --> 18:00.132
Well, I've got to get this baby weight off.

18:00.199 --> 18:02.033
Nothing fits me.

18:02.700 --> 18:03.999
I hate the way I look.

18:04.000 --> 18:06.099
You look fantastic, and you have to eat something.

18:06.100 --> 18:07.401
Could you give us a few minutes?

18:09.501 --> 18:10.599
What are you doing?

18:10.600 --> 18:12.466
She hasn't texted back.

18:12.800 --> 18:14.067
You just texted her.

18:14.700 --> 18:15.866
<i>You just texted her.</i>

18:16.200 --> 18:17.799
Besides, maybe she's taking care of the baby.

18:17.800 --> 18:20.332
She can't text you if she's taking care of the baby.

18:20.600 --> 18:24.500
And I also know that the whole idea of tonight is for the two of us to have a good time,

18:25.300 --> 18:28.733
to get your mind off the baby and relax.

18:29.300 --> 18:30.800
All right?

18:33.300 --> 18:34.499
What's going on? Are you all right?

18:34.500 --> 18:36.967
Yeah, I think I had my phone on, uh, vibrate.

18:37.300 --> 18:39.166
Scanlon here.

18:40.400 --> 18:43.599
Well, I'm just kind of in the middle of something.

18:44.400 --> 18:45.999
Yes, sir.

18:46.000 --> 18:48.000
You got it.

18:50.500 --> 18:51.799
I know that look.

18:51.800 --> 18:55.201
The Carlo case- there's, uh, been a breakthrough.

18:57.368 --> 18:58.500
I'll see you at home?

18:58.567 --> 19:00.101
Yeah, I'll see you at home.

19:02.900 --> 19:05.900
Obviously, the most important thing is that Bryce is home safely.

19:05.900 --> 19:09.300
We'll let you know more as it develops, but that's all for now. Thank you.

19:13.000 --> 19:14.799
It's okay. You did the right thing.

19:14.800 --> 19:17.667
You know you did the right thing.

19:18.500 --> 19:21.099
Okay, mission accomplished.

19:21.100 --> 19:23.199
As far as the Carlos are concerned,

19:23.200 --> 19:25.567
Allison led Lee to their son.

19:25.634 --> 19:26.499
- Thanks.
- Thanks.

19:26.500 --> 19:27.901
I don't understand.

19:28.300 --> 19:31.334
What was Bryce doing in that strange house all alone?

19:32.000 --> 19:33.499
We don't know yet.

19:33.500 --> 19:36.400
Yeah, the house is owned by a woman named Maribella Gomez.

19:36.400 --> 19:39.600
She freely admits that she's friends with the housekeeper, Elizabeth Torres,

19:39.600 --> 19:41.367
but has no idea what's going on.

19:41.800 --> 19:44.500
She wasn't home when Elizabeth came by to stash the baby.

19:45.200 --> 19:47.099
Has no idea why she would have broken into her house,

19:47.100 --> 19:48.267
no idea where she is now.

19:48.800 --> 19:51.199
Listen, Allison, if you're up to it,

19:51.266 --> 19:53.533
the Carlos would like to thank you personally.

19:54.800 --> 19:56.899
I know it sounds crazy,

19:56.900 --> 20:00.868
but if I can't hold him, protect him...

20:01.300 --> 20:03.667
Maybe some other time.

20:16.100 --> 20:17.267
Allison...

20:18.500 --> 20:19.867
Oh, geez.

20:21.300 --> 20:23.799
It's Bryce's.

20:23.800 --> 20:26.366
I guess somehow we missed it.

20:27.000 --> 20:28.899
Come on.

20:28.900 --> 20:30.900
Give it to me.

20:31.400 --> 20:33.667
Come on, I got to get rid of it.

20:34.700 --> 20:36.199
And Allison, I'm not trying to be mean,

20:36.200 --> 20:38.599
but that blanket is- it's evidence

20:38.600 --> 20:41.067
that Bryce was here, that he was in our house, so...

20:41.600 --> 20:42.699
come on, I gotta have it.

20:42.700 --> 20:44.233
I gotta burn it or something.

20:45.200 --> 20:47.300
It's okay. I'll do it.

20:47.366 --> 20:48.899
I will; I'll do it.

20:48.900 --> 20:51.034
In the morning.

21:08.400 --> 21:09.699
Oh, my goodness.

21:09.700 --> 21:11.700
I am so thrilled that you stopped by.

21:11.700 --> 21:15.568
I was so worried I wouldn't get a chance to thank you.

21:16.800 --> 21:19.234
I know I must have seemed a little crazy yesterday,

21:19.501 --> 21:21.799
talking about how much I trusted Elizabeth,

21:21.800 --> 21:23.933
even though she took my baby.

21:24.200 --> 21:26.634
It's just, sometimes things are so awful,

21:26.701 --> 21:28.800
it's like your brain can't take them in.

21:28.800 --> 21:29.901
No, I completely understand.

21:29.967 --> 21:31.499
I can't imagine what I would do

21:31.500 --> 21:34.368
if I woke up and one of my babies was gone.

21:34.500 --> 21:38.100
Well, speaking of which, where's Bryce?

21:38.201 --> 21:39.499
I'd really love to see him.

21:39.500 --> 21:40.899
I kind of miss that little guy.

21:40.900 --> 21:42.099
Well, actually, you just missed him.

21:42.100 --> 21:45.600
My husband Scott took him over to his grandparents for a little while.

21:46.934 --> 21:48.934
Oh, well, that's nice.

21:51.100 --> 21:53.399
Maybe I could just hang out

21:53.400 --> 21:55.500
till they get back.

21:57.800 --> 21:59.800
well, that's probably Scott now.

22:00.200 --> 22:02.866
Let me just see when he plans on heading back.

22:27.600 --> 22:30.367
Are you the lady who brought my brother back?

22:32.500 --> 22:34.433
I wish you hadn't done that.

22:34.900 --> 22:36.799
He's not safe here.

22:36.800 --> 22:41.000
I'm afraid Scott and Bryce will be gone all... day.

22:43.700 --> 22:45.700
it caught my eye.

22:49.200 --> 22:51.133
That's Lucy.

22:51.600 --> 22:53.833
She would've been six.

22:55.600 --> 22:57.034
She fell ill last year

22:57.201 --> 22:59.301
and, uh, died very suddenly.

23:00.600 --> 23:03.299
I'm so sorry.

23:03.300 --> 23:06.433
Be a year at Christmas.

23:06.600 --> 23:08.799
I don't know if you heard me, Scott and Bryce...

23:08.800 --> 23:10.001
Uh, they'll be gone all day.

23:11.800 --> 23:14.735
Well, give Bryce a- a hug for me.

23:15.200 --> 23:17.199
And thank you for the tea.

23:17.200 --> 23:19.133
No, thank you.

23:19.300 --> 23:21.500
Thank you for everything.

23:22.500 --> 23:25.600
Um, actually, Mrs. Lovett, I wasn't calling about Bridgette.

23:25.600 --> 23:29.200
Um, I was calling about our six-year-old.

23:29.700 --> 23:33.800
Um, I was wondering if-if, uh, she could get music lessons, too, you know?

23:33.800 --> 23:35.733
Maybe, uh, we could- we could do them, uh,

23:35.800 --> 23:38.033
back-to-back or...?

23:38.800 --> 23:41.099
You don't have any openings?

23:41.100 --> 23:43.067
Oh, wow, that's too bad.

23:44.000 --> 23:44.999
Could we, uh-

23:45.000 --> 23:47.933
could we maybe get on a wait list or...?

23:48.200 --> 23:49.866
She can have mine!

23:49.933 --> 23:51.033
Sorry, hold on one second.

23:51.100 --> 23:51.899
What's that, Bridge?

23:51.900 --> 23:52.599
My lesson.

23:52.600 --> 23:53.700
She can have it.

23:53.800 --> 23:55.399
It's at 4:00 tomorrow.

23:55.400 --> 23:56.499
I don't want it.

23:56.500 --> 23:58.900
But that's your lesson, Bridge.

23:58.900 --> 24:01.000
I... don't... want it.

24:01.000 --> 24:02.667
She can have it!

24:05.300 --> 24:07.300
Go away. I'm busy.

24:07.300 --> 24:10.233
Sorry, coming in anyway.

24:10.400 --> 24:11.832
Hi.

24:14.000 --> 24:15.899
Look, I know you got homework,

24:15.900 --> 24:18.267
but you have to clear something up for me.

24:18.300 --> 24:21.199
I thought I heard you say you wanted to quit clarinet.

24:21.200 --> 24:22.399
Yeah, so, what's the difference?

24:22.400 --> 24:24.200
I stink at it, anyways.

24:24.300 --> 24:24.999
What are you talking about?

24:25.000 --> 24:26.600
You've only been at it for two weeks.

24:26.800 --> 24:29.999
Yeah, and Marie's been playing for, like, two minutes.

24:30.000 --> 24:31.799
And she's already great.

24:31.800 --> 24:33.434
Come on, you can't do that.

24:33.700 --> 24:35.499
You can't compare yourself to Marie.

24:35.500 --> 24:37.599
I mean, I don't know what is going on there,

24:37.600 --> 24:41.100
but that girl clearly has a special aptitude for the clarinet.

24:41.100 --> 24:42.400
But I don't.

24:42.400 --> 24:46.900
Bridgette, you are already one of the most special people in the whole wide world.

24:46.900 --> 24:50.000
Really. Now, anybody who knows you would say that.

24:50.000 --> 24:51.500
No, you're wrong.

24:51.500 --> 24:53.267
Nobody's ever said that.

24:53.400 --> 24:54.799
Except you.

24:54.800 --> 24:55.699
Just now.

24:55.700 --> 24:57.700
And only because you're my Dad.

24:57.700 --> 24:59.267
I don't believe that.

24:59.500 --> 25:00.899
Yeah, well, it's true.

25:00.900 --> 25:02.867
You know who I am?

25:02.900 --> 25:04.866
I'm everybody's sister.

25:05.100 --> 25:06.466
That's not true.

25:06.700 --> 25:08.900
Yeah? Well, I'm Ariel's sister,

25:08.900 --> 25:11.300
because she's smart and she's pretty,

25:11.300 --> 25:13.233
and everybody likes her.

25:13.500 --> 25:16.899
And she knows about clothes and-and boys and dancing.

25:16.900 --> 25:19.867
And... now, I guess I'm Marie's sister, too.

25:20.100 --> 25:23.599
'Cause she can play clarinet without even trying.

25:25.300 --> 25:26.734
Come here.

25:29.100 --> 25:31.000
No, it absolutely it just broke my heart, you know.

25:31.000 --> 25:33.000
She just seemed so defeated by it.

25:37.700 --> 25:39.633
Do you hear me?

25:39.700 --> 25:41.700
Allison?

25:42.700 --> 25:44.635
Hey, Allison?

25:45.100 --> 25:47.299
I'm sorry, were you talking to me?

25:47.300 --> 25:48.199
Where are you?

25:48.200 --> 25:49.433
What are you so busy thinking about?

25:51.300 --> 25:53.233
Look, don't be mad.

25:54.000 --> 25:56.500
I went to see him today. I brought him his blanket.

25:56.500 --> 25:58.399
I can't believe I'm hearing this.

25:58.400 --> 26:00.999
I'm trying to talk to you about your own child.

26:02.266 --> 26:03.599
He had a sister.

26:03.600 --> 26:04.499
Had.

26:04.500 --> 26:06.934
She died a few months ago.

26:08.000 --> 26:10.099
She said that Bryce wasn't safe in that house.

26:10.100 --> 26:11.667
That I shouldn't have brought him back there.

26:11.900 --> 26:13.967
What, the dead sister told you this?

26:14.034 --> 26:15.934
Look, I checked her death records.

26:16.100 --> 26:18.799
It said "unexplained illnesses, natural causes. "

26:18.800 --> 26:21.000
Apparently, they took her to expert after expert.

26:21.000 --> 26:23.200
No one could really put their finger on it.

26:23.200 --> 26:24.099
What are you saying?

26:24.100 --> 26:27.300
Well, I'm saying something's wrong in that house.

26:27.800 --> 26:30.733
The sister said that Bryce wasn't safe there.

26:30.800 --> 26:33.499
The mother said the housekeeper lived for him.

26:33.500 --> 26:36.399
So, I'm starting to think maybe she didn't kidnap him at all,

26:36.400 --> 26:38.500
maybe she was trying to protect him.

26:38.800 --> 26:42.567
Maybe someone or something in that house killed the sister,

26:42.900 --> 26:45.100
and now it's trying to harm Bryce.

26:46.600 --> 26:47.900
What are you doing?

26:47.900 --> 26:49.399
I can't do this.

26:49.400 --> 26:52.333
I can't spend another ounce of energy on this thing.

26:52.500 --> 26:54.799
I spent last night running all over hell's half acre.

26:54.866 --> 26:57.166
- Hey, you asked me what was in my head.
- The little boy is home safe

26:57.200 --> 26:58.666
- I'm telling you what's in my head.
- with his parents.

26:58.800 --> 27:01.800
Our little girl is beside herself in her room.

27:08.400 --> 27:11.100
- Joe?
- Huh? Yeah? What?

27:11.400 --> 27:14.200
You have a dream? What's going on, Allison?

27:16.400 --> 27:17.299
That, do you hear that?

27:17.300 --> 27:19.068
What? Hear what?

27:19.300 --> 27:21.200
I listened for- Oh, Allison,

27:21.200 --> 27:22.766
look, it's almost 1:30 in the morning.

27:23.300 --> 27:25.200
No, that, that. That baby crying. 

27:25.300 --> 27:27.099
What are you -  there's no baby crying.

27:27.100 --> 27:28.499
What are you talking about?

27:28.700 --> 27:31.167
We don't have a baby.

27:31.300 --> 27:32.800
It's him. It's Bryce.

27:32.900 --> 27:34.933
He needs me. I'm going over there.

27:35.300 --> 27:36.099
Going where?

27:36.100 --> 27:37.499
To the Carlos'.

27:37.500 --> 27:39.000
I need to make sure he's okay.

27:39.200 --> 27:40.999
Hey! Are you listening to yourself?

27:41.000 --> 27:42.600
It's-it's the middle of the night.

27:42.600 --> 27:43.899
I don't care! He's in trouble.

27:43.900 --> 27:45.400
He needs me.

27:45.500 --> 27:47.433
For crap's sake.

27:55.100 --> 27:55.999
Help you?

27:56.000 --> 27:57.901
Mr. Carlo, I-I...

27:58.100 --> 27:59.899
We met the other day. I was with Detective Scanlon.

27:59.900 --> 28:01.067
This is my husband Joe.

28:01.600 --> 28:03.599
Look, I know it's the middle of the night;

28:03.600 --> 28:05.899
I- I know this is really unusual, but I was wondering

28:05.900 --> 28:07.834
if I could just look in on Bryce.

28:08.100 --> 28:09.499
Allison.

28:09.500 --> 28:11.800
What-what's going on? What are you doing here?

28:11.800 --> 28:13.599
This...

28:13.600 --> 28:15.399
this... hard to explain.

28:15.400 --> 28:17.999
I just- I need to see Bryce.

28:18.166 --> 28:19.999
I just- I need to know that he's okay.

28:20.000 --> 28:21.600
Why wouldn't he be okay?

28:23.000 --> 28:24.199
Oh, no, no.

28:24.200 --> 28:25.700
Did we do that? The doorbell?

28:26.000 --> 28:28.599
No, no, this is pretty much par for the course.

28:28.600 --> 28:30.300
Well, as long as that's the case.

28:30.300 --> 28:32.066
I mean, if he's up,

28:32.133 --> 28:35.266
is there any way that I can just see him?

28:36.800 --> 28:39.733
Oh, he's such a beautiful boy.

28:42.500 --> 28:45.500
Your little girl never got to meet him, did she?

28:46.900 --> 28:51.766
I got pregnant just before she passed.

28:52.000 --> 28:55.400
I know Scott was worried that I was so filled with grief

28:55.400 --> 28:57.967
that I might lose him.

28:58.700 --> 29:02.100
I can't imagine what it would be like to go through that.

29:02.400 --> 29:06.099
Well, the hardest part was never getting any answers.

29:06.100 --> 29:09.033
Never knowing what was wrong.

29:09.600 --> 29:11.199
I mean, the only thing

29:11.200 --> 29:14.467
everyone seemed to agree on was that she was dying.

29:14.600 --> 29:17.633
Did you ever consider getting an autopsy, so you would know why?

29:18.800 --> 29:20.234
Allison.

29:21.267 --> 29:23.200
Uh, no.

29:23.600 --> 29:26.567
Lucy suffered too much.

29:26.900 --> 29:29.900
We couldn't put her through that, too.

29:30.300 --> 29:34.567
And, ultimately, an autopsy would've just been for our benefit, not hers.

29:35.300 --> 29:37.599
We just wanted her to rest in peace.

29:37.600 --> 29:39.600
I just don't understand why they wouldn't get an autopsy.

29:39.800 --> 29:41.099
I mean, if one of our girls died...?

29:41.100 --> 29:43.634
Allison, you have to stop.

29:44.300 --> 29:48.000
That family opened their door to us at 3:00 in the morning.

29:48.000 --> 29:49.267
They're not evil.

29:49.300 --> 29:50.633
If anything, they're saints.

29:50.700 --> 29:52.099
Okay, I'm not saying they're not nice,

29:52.100 --> 29:53.499
I just - I think it's strange... Strange?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.600
Strange? You want to talk about strange?

29:55.800 --> 29:57.100
Look, I hate to break it to you,

29:57.100 --> 29:59.300
but the only thing strange about that house tonight

29:59.300 --> 30:00.899
was the fact that we were in it.

30:00.900 --> 30:03.500
Now, you have to leave that family alone.

30:03.600 --> 30:05.166
I mean it.

30:13.101 --> 30:14.699
Go away. I'm tired.

30:14.700 --> 30:16.267
Yeah, well, too bad.

30:16.334 --> 30:18.267
It's time to get up.

30:18.334 --> 30:20.400
Well, I haven't even been to sleep yet.

30:20.467 --> 30:22.234
What are you talking about? It's morning.

30:22.300 --> 30:23.933
You've been asleep all night.

30:24.000 --> 30:26.134
Uh-uh. Not really. I've been dreaming.

30:26.200 --> 30:28.367
Dreaming about that stupid song.

30:29.434 --> 30:31.999
What are you talking about?

30:32.000 --> 30:33.999
You dream that song?

30:34.000 --> 30:36.499
There's this old man and he has a clarinet.

30:36.500 --> 30:40.300
And all he does is play that song over and over again.

30:40.300 --> 30:41.934
Showed me how to do it.

30:42.001 --> 30:43.600
I hate it.

30:43.601 --> 30:45.534
Well, I don't know what to tell you.

30:45.601 --> 30:47.701
Why are you even telling me all this?

30:47.766 --> 30:50.400
Because you're my big sister.

30:56.901 --> 30:58.899
Allison.

30:58.900 --> 31:02.100
Sir, I-I was wanting to ask you about Bryce Carlo.

31:02.167 --> 31:03.400
When you brought him in,

31:03.401 --> 31:04.999
did anyone run any blood work,

31:05.000 --> 31:07.600
anything that could test for toxins in his system?

31:07.600 --> 31:08.999
Sure.

31:09.000 --> 31:11.300
Blood tests are fairly routine in child abduction cases.

31:11.300 --> 31:13.399
We look for sedatives, tranquilizers.

31:13.400 --> 31:15.334
The good news is, in Bryce's case,

31:15.600 --> 31:17.600
everything came back completely normal.

31:20.100 --> 31:21.800
Devalos.

31:22.200 --> 31:23.799
Yeah.

31:23.800 --> 31:25.566
Okay.

31:25.900 --> 31:27.467
I'll be right there.

31:27.534 --> 31:28.501
That was the morgue.

31:29.400 --> 31:31.600
Seems a sanitation worker found a

31:31.600 --> 31:36.400
corpse stuffed in an abandoned refrigerator in one of our municipal landfills early this morning.

31:36.600 --> 31:40.100
Matches the description of our missing kidnapper, Elizabeth Torres.

31:45.600 --> 31:47.499
Yes.

31:47.500 --> 31:49.799
That's her.

31:49.800 --> 31:51.166
That's my cousin.

31:54.400 --> 31:57.333
Thank you for coming down and making the identification.

31:58.800 --> 32:02.100
I may have a few more questions. If want to just wait outside?

32:12.600 --> 32:15.066
M.E.'s calling cause of death blunt-force trauma.

32:15.100 --> 32:17.399
Looks like she took a couple of hard blows to the head.

32:17.400 --> 32:18.601
Hard enough to kill her.

32:19.000 --> 32:21.934
Doesn't make a lot of sense.

32:22.000 --> 32:23.899
This woman takes a baby boy,

32:23.900 --> 32:25.000
you find the baby boy,

32:25.067 --> 32:27.000
<i>then someone kills the kidnapper?</i>

32:27.700 --> 32:28.999
Something's missing.

32:29.000 --> 32:29.799
Like what?

32:29.800 --> 32:32.800
To begin with, I still can't figure out why this woman took that child,

32:32.800 --> 32:35.500
only to abandon him at the house where Allison found him.

32:36.000 --> 32:38.000
Might make sense to have forensics go back,

32:38.000 --> 32:39.933
see if they can find any of this woman's blood.

32:40.100 --> 32:40.899
<i>All right, girls.</i>

32:40.900 --> 32:42.500
Hey, girls, come on.

32:42.600 --> 32:44.400
It's time to leave for Marie's music lesson.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.599
Hey, Dad?

32:45.600 --> 32:46.533
Yeah.

32:47.000 --> 32:50.700
Marie wanted me to tell you that she doesn't want to go to her lesson.

32:51.200 --> 32:52.600
What?! Why?

32:58.900 --> 33:00.499
All right, sweetheart.

33:00.500 --> 33:01.767
All good?

33:01.834 --> 33:03.834
Okay, come on.

33:10.100 --> 33:11.299
She okay?

33:13.200 --> 33:15.133
Well, not yet, but eventually.

33:15.400 --> 33:17.900
<i>This is one of those things, isn't it?</i>

33:17.967 --> 33:19.099
Uh, yes, yes.

33:19.100 --> 33:22.234
This definitely appears to be one of those things.

33:23.100 --> 33:24.799
So, how do we fix it?

33:24.800 --> 33:26.767
How do we make her stop hearing that song?

33:27.100 --> 33:27.999
I don't know, Bridge.

33:28.000 --> 33:29.933
I honestly- I don't know.

33:30.100 --> 33:31.700
From my experience with mom

33:31.766 --> 33:34.299
and with Ariel and even with you,

33:34.300 --> 33:37.633
it's best to just let these things run their course.

33:54.200 --> 33:54.899
Hello?

33:54.900 --> 33:56.900
Allison, I, uh, I hope I didn't wake you.

33:57.167 --> 33:58.299
I just called to let you know

33:58.300 --> 34:01.400
that the police went back out to that house where you found the Carlo boy.

34:01.400 --> 34:05.400
They actually found a small spot of blood on the underside of a doorknob.

34:05.633 --> 34:08.800
The blood matched some blood that we found on Elizabeth Torres's body-

34:08.800 --> 34:10.400
blood that wasn't hers.

34:10.900 --> 34:12.199
So, while we don't yet have a suspect,

34:12.199 --> 34:13.899
the good news is, once we do,

34:13.900 --> 34:16.367
we have enough forensic evidence to nail him for murder.

34:17.300 --> 34:19.399
Anyway, I'm, uh...

34:19.400 --> 34:21.801
I'm going to go home, go to bed.

34:22.199 --> 34:24.199
You do that, sir.

34:47.500 --> 34:48.498
Allison.

34:48.500 --> 34:49.599
It's 1:00 a. m.

34:49.600 --> 34:50.600
I know, I know.

34:50.601 --> 34:51.967
I'm sorry to have wake you and Scott.

34:52.699 --> 34:53.498
Scott's not here.

34:53.500 --> 34:54.800
He's out of town on business.

34:54.800 --> 34:56.299
Look, I'm sorry, Dana.

34:56.300 --> 34:57.800
I'm sorry! I'm sorry!

34:57.800 --> 34:59.100
You're a nice person.

34:59.101 --> 35:01.401
I need you to understand everything that I am doing,

35:01.607 --> 35:03.374
I am doing for Bryce.

35:03.700 --> 35:04.799
What-what are you talking about?

35:04.800 --> 35:05.799
What are you doing for Bryce?

35:05.800 --> 35:07.699
I hope you're not going to ask to see him again.

35:07.700 --> 35:09.299
No, I don't need to just see him.

35:09.300 --> 35:10.733
I need to take him.

35:11.200 --> 35:12.699
Bryce needs to be with me!

35:12.700 --> 35:14.300
Okay, Allison, you need to leave.

35:14.367 --> 35:15.299
I'm serious.

35:15.300 --> 35:16.267
You're not welcome here.

35:16.334 --> 35:17.700
Bryce isn't going to be with you.

35:17.700 --> 35:19.367
That's just never going to happen.

35:31.200 --> 35:32.199
Hi. Hello.

35:32.200 --> 35:33.633
Hey, it's me. I'm fine.

35:33.800 --> 35:35.399
You're fine? You're fine?

35:35.400 --> 35:39.200
Allison, I'm calling you, like, 35 times.

35:39.600 --> 35:40.799
Did you turn off your cell phone?

35:40.800 --> 35:41.999
I had to throw it away.

35:42.000 --> 35:44.833
I knew they were going to use it to try to track me down.

35:44.900 --> 35:47.301
Look, I just want you to know that I'm safe.

35:47.500 --> 35:49.500
I can't tell you where we are, but we're safe.

35:49.600 --> 35:50.699
But you're not.

35:50.700 --> 35:53.500
The whole state of Arizona is looking for you.

35:53.500 --> 35:55.699
They got AMBER alerts and APBs.

35:55.700 --> 35:56.900
I beg you, turn yourself in.

35:57.100 --> 35:58.299
Now!

35:58.300 --> 36:00.900
If we're lucky, all they're charge you with is assault.

36:00.900 --> 36:02.199
I can't.

36:02.200 --> 36:03.699
I can't explain it.

36:03.700 --> 36:05.633
It's just... I know.

36:05.800 --> 36:07.932
For now he's supposed to be with me.

36:07.999 --> 36:09.299
But he's not.

36:09.300 --> 36:11.267
Allison, please, tell me where you are.

36:11.600 --> 36:13.567
Tell me at least you have a plan.

36:13.634 --> 36:15.434
There's no plan.

36:15.500 --> 36:17.600
He had to sleep, eat.

36:18.100 --> 36:21.000
I need to sleep. Honey, I have to get off the phone.

36:21.000 --> 36:23.799
I know that they're probably tracing our home number.

36:24.000 --> 36:26.100
I love you. I love the girls.

36:26.800 --> 36:28.333
I'll see you soon.

36:31.032 --> 36:32.800
Mirabella!

36:32.867 --> 36:34.800
It's Elizabeth.

36:35.600 --> 36:38.700
Please. I'm in trouble.

36:38.700 --> 36:40.700
I need help.

36:50.300 --> 36:53.400
Mirabella? ¿Estas en casa?

36:56.600 --> 36:58.300
<i>¿Hola?</i>

37:02.300 --> 37:04.399
Elizabeth?

37:04.400 --> 37:06.400
I know you're here!

37:08.600 --> 37:10.533
- Elizabeth?
- Primo!

37:11.500 --> 37:14.000
<i>Primo, what are you doing here?</i>

37:14.000 --> 37:15.799
What am I doing here?

37:15.800 --> 37:17.599
You know exactly what I'm doing here.

37:17.600 --> 37:19.499
You think you could just cut me out of my own plan?

37:19.500 --> 37:20.434
No.

37:20.600 --> 37:23.200
No, you're wrong. I... I would never...

37:23.200 --> 37:26.400
You would never what? What, you never what?

37:28.600 --> 37:31.599
No, no, I did everything you asked.

37:31.600 --> 37:33.634
I gave you the alarm code.

37:34.200 --> 37:35.299
I took pictures.

37:35.300 --> 37:37.799
Yes, you were a good cousin.

37:37.800 --> 37:39.699
You did everything you were supposed to.

37:40.100 --> 37:41.134
Maybe too much.

37:41.600 --> 37:42.599
No.

37:42.600 --> 37:43.599
- Yes.
- No.

37:43.600 --> 37:45.433
Yes. How else do you explain it?

37:46.000 --> 37:48.200
This morning when Martin and I were supposed to kidnap the baby,

37:48.200 --> 37:49.799
we find out he's already gone.

37:49.800 --> 37:51.867
- Alberto...
- And then the TV.

37:51.934 --> 37:54.200
They're saying the person who took it was you.

37:54.200 --> 37:55.567
I want that baby!

37:58.300 --> 38:00.700
I'm sorry, Alberto, he's not here.

38:01.700 --> 38:03.599
I don't have him anymore.

38:03.600 --> 38:06.567
I gave him to Mirabella. She's gone to the police.

38:06.633 --> 38:08.400
She's going to tell them everything.

38:09.200 --> 38:10.299
You're lying!

38:10.300 --> 38:11.400
No!

38:11.700 --> 38:13.299
It's the truth.

38:13.300 --> 38:14.901
I don't lie.

38:15.400 --> 38:17.534
Not like you lied to me.

38:17.901 --> 38:19.100
Martin told me

38:19.100 --> 38:21.566
he told me you were never going to give that baby back,

38:21.567 --> 38:23.100
even if they paid the ransom.

38:23.200 --> 38:27.433
That you were going to sell him for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

38:28.300 --> 38:31.300
I could never be a part of that.

38:32.000 --> 38:34.000
You cannot really be my cousin.

38:34.700 --> 38:36.433
You are not even human.

38:51.000 --> 38:53.266
Ma'am, you're under arrest.

38:53.300 --> 38:56.500
I'm gonna need you to put your hands on your head and surrender the child.

39:11.366 --> 39:14.767
I'm so sorry that I sprayed you in the eyes.

39:18.200 --> 39:20.999
I just had a conversation with the man you work for-

39:21.000 --> 39:23.200
the district attorney.

39:23.200 --> 39:26.000
He explained to me that I have every right to prosecute you

39:26.000 --> 39:29.433
for kidnapping Bryce, assaulting me.

39:30.000 --> 39:33.633
Every right to send you to prison for a very long time.

39:35.600 --> 39:37.300
But, uh...

39:38.600 --> 39:41.299
...he also confessed

39:41.300 --> 39:44.799
that he thought that would be a huge mistake.

39:44.800 --> 39:47.700
And then he talked to me about you and your dreams.

39:47.700 --> 39:53.100
He told me it was a dream of yours that led police to the man who killed our nanny.

39:53.601 --> 39:57.199
That once they brought him in, he confessed.

39:57.200 --> 40:02.233
He told them that after you had brought Bryce back to me and Scott,

40:02.300 --> 40:05.500
Alberto and his partner realized they still had the alarm code.

40:05.501 --> 40:09.234
They still had everything they needed to go through with the kidnapping.

40:09.400 --> 40:11.799
They even had my husband's travel schedule,

40:11.800 --> 40:13.001
which is why last night,

40:13.067 --> 40:17.034
shortly after you assaulted me and took my son,

40:17.700 --> 40:19.366
they came to my house.

40:19.433 --> 40:20.566
Oh, my God.

40:20.633 --> 40:22.099
If you hadn't taken Bryce,

40:22.100 --> 40:25.899
it appears they would have.

40:25.900 --> 40:27.399
They-They pulled up to our house

40:27.400 --> 40:29.300
and found police cars in our driveway.

40:29.300 --> 40:31.800
Police cars that were there because of you, Mrs. Dubois;

40:31.800 --> 40:33.800
because you'd taken my little boy.

40:34.800 --> 40:38.299
Now maybe it was just a coincidence,

40:38.300 --> 40:44.500
but I prefer to believe this...

40:45.800 --> 40:48.299
this thing you have,

40:48.300 --> 40:55.068
this gift... it forced you to keep Bryce safe.

40:56.900 --> 40:58.900
And that's what I prefer to believe.

41:00.400 --> 41:03.801
You're not going to prosecute me?

41:04.600 --> 41:06.899
I told your boss that my memory of last night is faulty.

41:06.900 --> 41:10.700
I'm not comfortable testifying about what happened.

41:10.700 --> 41:12.299
Oh, thank you.

41:12.300 --> 41:15.600
Stay away from my house, Allison.

41:16.100 --> 41:18.266
Stay away from my family.

41:18.333 --> 41:19.299
If-If I ever see you again,

41:19.300 --> 41:22.800
my memory may very well improve, do you understand?

41:23.801 --> 41:26.599
I understand.

41:26.600 --> 41:29.799
But it's not going to be a problem.

41:29.800 --> 41:32.934
I was there when Bryce needed me.

41:33.000 --> 41:38.200
But I think for the rest of his life, one mother is plenty.

42:05.000 --> 42:06.467
Excuse me.

42:06.534 --> 42:09.234
Can u tell me the name of that song?

42:13.900 --> 42:16.599
It doesn't have a name, actually.

42:16.600 --> 42:18.299
I wrote it.

42:18.300 --> 42:20.401
Well, me and my dad anyway.

42:20.800 --> 42:22.600
I'm Mr. Bronson, by the way.

42:23.500 --> 42:24.699
And who are you?

42:24.700 --> 42:25.834
Bridgette Dubois.

42:26.301 --> 42:29.067
Nice to meet you, Bridgette Dubois.

42:29.100 --> 42:31.367
Yeah, this song doesn't have a name-

42:31.400 --> 42:33.133
'cause it doesn't have an ending.

42:33.600 --> 42:34.899
We never finished it.

42:34.900 --> 42:37.699
I was working on it with my father when he, uh...

42:37.700 --> 42:39.034
he passed away suddenly.

42:41.200 --> 42:42.499
Wait right here.

42:42.500 --> 42:45.667
I think I know someone you're gonna want to meet.
