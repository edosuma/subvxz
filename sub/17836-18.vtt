01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
You pulled this off

01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
one of the bodies

01:05.566 --> 01:07.401
in the woods?

01:08.443 --> 01:09.444
Malia did.

01:10.237 --> 01:11.405
Yeah, there were

01:10.237 --> 01:11.405
six dead bodies,

01:11.446 --> 01:12.698
and one of them

01:11.446 --> 01:12.698
had no face.

01:13.281 --> 01:15.492
Okay, so the one

01:13.281 --> 01:15.492
with no face,

01:15.534 --> 01:16.785
you think that's

01:15.534 --> 01:16.785
the woman on the phone?

01:17.995 --> 01:19.038
Maybe.

01:19.371 --> 01:20.789
It's the same thing

01:19.371 --> 01:20.789
that happened to Aaron.

01:21.874 --> 01:23.042
It took over his body,

01:23.709 --> 01:26.503
basically stole

01:23.709 --> 01:26.503
his face and his DNA.

01:26.545 --> 01:28.881
So that means

01:26.545 --> 01:28.881
whoever this woman is,

01:29.840 --> 01:31.967
she could be

01:29.840 --> 01:31.967
the other half

01:29.840 --> 01:31.967
of the Anuk-ite.

01:32.885 --> 01:35.012
Which means she's just

01:32.885 --> 01:35.012
half of the problem.

01:35.554 --> 01:37.056
The other half

01:35.554 --> 01:37.056
we already know about, Aaron.

01:37.305 --> 01:38.682
We don't know

01:37.305 --> 01:38.682
where he is, though.

01:38.724 --> 01:39.725
THEO: Okay, hold on.

01:40.183 --> 01:42.185
Aren't we supposed to keep

01:40.183 --> 01:42.185
both halves apart?

01:42.895 --> 01:46.065
If we know about one half,

01:42.895 --> 01:46.065
let's just go for that one,

01:42.895 --> 01:46.065
that's Aaron.

01:46.565 --> 01:48.483
I'm not agreeing with Theo,

01:48.525 --> 01:51.737

01:48.525 --> 01:51.737
to track down Aaron

01:48.525 --> 01:51.737
over a voice on a phone.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.197
That's agreeing with Theo.

01:52.279 --> 01:54.197
MASON: Yeah.

01:54.239 --> 01:57.158
But I thought I'd try

01:54.239 --> 01:57.158

01:58.953 --> 02:01.080
Is everyone completely shocked

01:58.953 --> 02:01.080

02:01.121 --> 02:02.831
No, we just don't like it.

02:03.331 --> 02:05.793
maybe we should be

02:03.331 --> 02:05.793

02:05.834 --> 02:07.419
Aaron and the woman

02:05.834 --> 02:07.419
on the phone.

02:08.378 --> 02:09.755
I mean,

02:08.378 --> 02:09.755
since you guys agree...

02:10.589 --> 02:13.216
Wait, you mean, me and...

02:10.589 --> 02:13.216
Him?

02:13.258 --> 02:16.929
Yeah. You two find Aaron.

02:17.512 --> 02:19.473

02:17.512 --> 02:19.473

02:17.512 --> 02:19.473
is on the phone.

02:19.723 --> 02:21.100
If we find either half,

02:21.850 --> 02:23.978
maybe we don't have to

02:21.850 --> 02:23.978
fight at all.

02:24.686 --> 02:26.105

02:33.821 --> 02:34.947
supposed to do?

02:36.073 --> 02:37.866
Figure out how a Hellhound

02:36.073 --> 02:37.866

02:37.908 --> 02:40.410

02:42.955 --> 02:43.998

02:44.372 --> 02:45.666

02:45.707 --> 02:47.250

20:02.035 --> 20:03.285
That means the bullet

20:02.035 --> 20:03.285
is ferromagnetic,

20:02.035 --> 20:03.285
probably steel.

20:03.327 --> 20:04.662

We'll increase

20:05.454 --> 20:06.747
the magnet's power

20:06.789 --> 20:08.290
and the machine will pull

20:06.789 --> 20:08.290
the bullet right out.

20:09.000 --> 20:11.002

It's not just steel.

20:30.063 --> 20:31.605
See those fragments around it?

20:31.647 --> 20:32.690
That's silver.

20:33.066 --> 20:34.192
The bullet was coated with it.

20:35.068 --> 20:36.527
Silver won't react in the MRI.

20:37.111 --> 20:39.864
We pull that bullet out

20:37.111 --> 20:39.864
and he'll start to heal.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.991
Healing is good.

20:39.906 --> 20:41.991
But he's a Hellhound.

20:42.033 --> 20:43.034
He'll heat up.

20:44.827 --> 20:46.537
When he does,

20:44.827 --> 20:46.537
that silver is going to melt

20:44.827 --> 20:46.537
and seep right into his brain.

20:47.329 --> 20:48.622

20:48.956 --> 20:51.375
Argyria. Silver poisoning.

20:51.709 --> 20:53.377
of getting it out.
