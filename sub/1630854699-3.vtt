WEBVTT

00:37.370 --> 00:39.956
Your clothes are there by the fire.

00:51.926 --> 00:53.762
You could have died out there.

00:59.059 --> 01:00.185
How did I get here?

01:00.852 --> 01:02.437
I had you brought inside.

01:29.255 --> 01:33.218
Next time you want to kill yourself
with lightning, use this.

01:34.552 --> 01:37.889
It'll do a better job of attracting
a bolt than your head.

01:38.473 --> 01:40.141
I wasn't trying to kill myself.

01:40.225 --> 01:42.310
I was looking for…

01:45.188 --> 01:46.523
You don't have to explain.

01:48.066 --> 01:48.900
Good.

01:50.443 --> 01:52.362
Because I may not be able to.

02:00.161 --> 02:01.287
Is that a book?

02:03.665 --> 02:05.208
I've never seen one before.

02:06.668 --> 02:07.877
You must be wealthy.

02:11.005 --> 02:12.340
It goes the other way.

02:15.426 --> 02:17.887
You can, uh… read it?

02:17.971 --> 02:21.141
Yes. It is a book of ideas.

02:21.808 --> 02:23.643
-Whose?
-Mine.

02:24.227 --> 02:25.353
I wrote it.

02:25.937 --> 02:27.021
Where are you from?

02:27.605 --> 02:31.234
I was born in Aleppo, a city in the south.

02:31.317 --> 02:34.696
And one of the great seats of knowledge.

02:34.779 --> 02:37.866
It has been my life journey
to travel to the others.

02:38.575 --> 02:45.165
Preslav, Alexandria, and of course,
the greatest of them all, Constantinople.

02:53.256 --> 02:55.675
-A rock that falls from the sky?
-Yes.

02:56.259 --> 02:57.635
A meteorite.

03:00.847 --> 03:01.931
You're unwell.

03:02.682 --> 03:03.641
Just cold.

03:04.934 --> 03:08.479
In Greenland
that cough has a name. <i>Gastkramning.</i>

03:10.106 --> 03:11.524
To be squeezed by a ghost.

03:18.072 --> 03:20.783
It was my wish
to return to Constantinople.

03:22.619 --> 03:24.204
There are good doctors there.

03:25.872 --> 03:30.627
But at least here,
I have the skies and my books.

03:40.970 --> 03:45.391
Thank you for, uh,
bringing me in from the cold.

03:46.017 --> 03:48.353
I didn't know
if it was a good thing or not.

03:50.563 --> 03:51.439
It was.

04:55.628 --> 04:57.297
The boats are loaded.

04:57.380 --> 05:00.800
With your blessing,
the raid is certain to be a success.

05:05.471 --> 05:07.307
You never come inside the temple.

05:08.224 --> 05:10.518
It is only for those
who speak with the gods.

05:12.270 --> 05:13.563
The temple must stay pure.

05:15.064 --> 05:15.898
Pure?

05:16.649 --> 05:18.568
No one can own the gods.

05:19.235 --> 05:22.572
In Uppsala, all are invited to the temple.

05:26.075 --> 05:27.577
This is not Uppsala.

05:51.017 --> 05:53.394
Take it. Go quickly.

06:02.195 --> 06:03.946
Move it! There's more! Get more!

06:23.674 --> 06:26.803
You two, go on with the others.
We need help loading the boats.

06:54.455 --> 06:57.583
I'm told you are with child.

06:59.961 --> 07:01.170
I am.

07:05.007 --> 07:05.883
Friends!

07:08.010 --> 07:12.473
Freydis, our Gudija, is with child.

07:15.768 --> 07:17.770
It is an honor to us.

07:17.854 --> 07:20.022
A gift from the Gods.

07:20.106 --> 07:23.192
A promise for our future!

07:30.867 --> 07:32.285
We're both happy for you.

07:33.119 --> 07:35.413
-Thank you.
-Gudrid will take care of you.

07:35.955 --> 07:38.040
And I've left Jorundr in case of trouble.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.172
Trouble?

08:14.285 --> 08:15.411
How much for the boat?

08:16.662 --> 08:17.788
It's not for sale.

08:17.872 --> 08:18.998
I'll pay double.

08:20.166 --> 08:22.418
I have cargo to shift to Constantinople.

08:26.380 --> 08:27.423
So do I.

08:28.466 --> 08:31.969
But there's Pecheneg camps now
on both sides of the river.

08:32.053 --> 08:34.388
Which is why
anybody that can make it through

08:35.056 --> 08:37.350
can command twice the price for its cargo.

08:39.644 --> 08:43.189
So you have other Vikings like yourself
to guard your cargo?

08:44.524 --> 08:45.399
Only the best.

08:48.861 --> 08:52.240
My name is Gestr.
There are two cargo lockers on board.

08:52.323 --> 08:54.825
If you can get me to Constantinople,

08:55.743 --> 08:57.078
I could give you one.

09:00.498 --> 09:03.417
I'm Harald. What is your cargo?

09:05.002 --> 09:06.170
Slaves.

09:16.681 --> 09:17.765
Watch. Watch.

09:27.108 --> 09:29.026
She never uses a defensive strike.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.739
Even in guard position.

09:45.001 --> 09:47.253
That was good.

09:49.255 --> 09:51.757
Girl with the stick. Come here.

09:57.305 --> 09:58.472
What is your name?

09:59.140 --> 10:01.017
-Hrefna.
-Hrefna.

10:02.059 --> 10:03.477
You move well.

10:03.561 --> 10:06.230
Hrefna is just a silly girl
playing with sticks.

10:06.314 --> 10:09.525
That's… That's not what I saw.

10:10.651 --> 10:13.404
-Where did you learn to fight like that?
-My father.

10:13.946 --> 10:15.781
He was a great Viking warrior.

10:18.034 --> 10:21.746
-Let's see what you can do.
-No, it is not allowed.

10:25.082 --> 10:25.916
Why?

10:27.460 --> 10:30.671
Only the descendants from Skuld
are allowed to carry weapons.

10:30.755 --> 10:33.758
The Norns wove all of our fates together,

10:33.841 --> 10:35.760
binding each of us to our ancestors.

10:37.219 --> 10:38.929
We must each perform the ritual.

10:40.222 --> 10:41.390
What is this ritual?

10:44.310 --> 10:45.227
A journey.

10:47.313 --> 10:49.315
To the boneyard of our ancestors.

10:49.398 --> 10:51.692
It is a spiritual
as well as physical challenge

10:51.776 --> 10:54.737
that every Jomsviking warrior takes
to prove their worth.

10:56.155 --> 10:57.865
It should be open for all.

10:57.948 --> 10:59.825
The girl has no ancestors here.

10:59.909 --> 11:02.953
Neither do I. Yet, you welcomed me.

11:05.164 --> 11:06.624
We are all Vikings.

11:07.875 --> 11:13.673
So I claim the ancestors of Jomsborg
as my own and all others who come here.

11:15.341 --> 11:16.842
Including this girl.

11:18.719 --> 11:20.096
I will allow it.

11:20.680 --> 11:21.806
Come on.

11:25.226 --> 11:26.686
Show them what you can do.

11:31.899 --> 11:32.775
Attack!

11:47.790 --> 11:50.292
Hrefna, you are good, so good.

11:51.252 --> 11:53.796
-Keep practicing.
-Thank you, Freydis.

11:59.009 --> 12:00.219
That is enough.

12:00.970 --> 12:03.973
You can go now. Go on.

12:13.607 --> 12:16.444
I hope you didn't spend
all of your money on this whale.

12:17.987 --> 12:19.238
Don't insult my boat.

12:20.823 --> 12:22.199
I've grown attached to it.

12:23.284 --> 12:24.660
I can't lie about boats.

12:27.163 --> 12:29.290
And I have no patience for pessimists.

12:29.373 --> 12:30.666
What about the Pechenegs?

12:31.584 --> 12:33.085
Why do you care?

12:33.169 --> 12:35.463
Changed your mind
about what you said to me?

12:35.546 --> 12:36.881
No.

12:38.174 --> 12:40.468
I've changed my mind about going with you.

12:42.344 --> 12:44.096
If I'm going to captain your boat,

12:45.556 --> 12:47.725
I need to know
what your plan is to avoid them.

12:48.726 --> 12:50.352
By starting now.

12:52.062 --> 12:54.148
Now? A boat over ice?

12:55.649 --> 12:56.525
On a sled.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.946
If we can make it to the Rus
before the thaw,

13:01.030 --> 13:03.282
we can use the high water
from the ice melt

13:03.365 --> 13:05.451
to carry us through the shallower rapids,

13:06.160 --> 13:09.997
avoiding the need to portage,
and the Pechenegs.

13:14.251 --> 13:15.544
So what about the crew?

13:17.004 --> 13:19.131
You know anyone desperate
enough to join us?

13:20.424 --> 13:21.258
I might.

13:23.260 --> 13:25.429
Too dangerous
in Novgorod for you?

13:29.600 --> 13:32.853
If you're here for your money,
I don't have it.

13:33.437 --> 13:35.022
I didn't come for my money.

13:36.732 --> 13:38.859
I came to offer you both a job.

13:39.610 --> 13:40.444
Doing what?

13:40.945 --> 13:42.947
I'm taking a boat to Constantinople.

13:44.281 --> 13:45.825
I need men who can fight.

13:45.908 --> 13:48.118
That is not an easy journey.

13:48.202 --> 13:50.120
No one said it would be easy.

13:51.247 --> 13:53.123
But you'll be well paid when we get there.

13:53.207 --> 13:55.334
And what about the Pechenegs?

13:55.417 --> 13:57.962
We were lucky to get past them once.

13:58.045 --> 13:59.880
I don't want to trust luck again.

14:03.801 --> 14:06.011
Then I suggest you go back to Novgorod

14:07.096 --> 14:10.599
where your odds of success
are much better.

14:14.645 --> 14:15.479
Wait.

14:19.775 --> 14:20.776
We'll join you.

14:26.574 --> 14:29.034
-What are your names?
-I'm Kaysan.

14:30.035 --> 14:31.620
That is Batu.

14:31.704 --> 14:34.832
-I'm Leif.
-Do you have a guide?

14:34.915 --> 14:38.002
-Someone who knows the rivers?
-No. Do you know of one?

14:38.586 --> 14:40.212
There is such a man in Novgorod.

14:41.005 --> 14:43.883
Supposedly he knows the Dnieper
better than anyone.

14:43.966 --> 14:45.384
Where do we find him?

14:57.104 --> 14:59.481
I'm looking for a guide to the Dnieper.

15:01.108 --> 15:02.192
One called Kurya.

15:03.110 --> 15:04.361
Stop this!

15:06.280 --> 15:07.823
You prison filth!

15:09.074 --> 15:10.242
Would that be you?

15:11.076 --> 15:14.246
-Why would you want to know?

15:17.708 --> 15:19.877
I'm taking cargo to Constantinople.

15:21.003 --> 15:22.838
I need someone who can get me there.

15:24.757 --> 15:26.592
Someone who knows the river well.

15:26.675 --> 15:28.135
I know the Dnieper.

15:28.969 --> 15:30.429
I've run it a hundred times.

15:30.512 --> 15:32.139
I'm Harald Sigurdsson.

15:33.098 --> 15:37.436
If you agree,
I can secure your release from here.

15:38.020 --> 15:41.857
So I would be trading a prison
sentence for a death sentence.

15:41.941 --> 15:45.277
If you mean the Pechenegs,
I have a plan to avoid them.

15:45.861 --> 15:46.695
Really?

15:47.821 --> 15:50.282
I intend to ride the high water
over the rapids,

15:50.991 --> 15:53.160
and so avoid the portages
where they attack.

15:53.243 --> 15:54.620
It is a bold plan,

15:55.454 --> 15:58.999
but unfortunately, you cannot avoid
meeting a Pecheneg on this journey.

15:59.083 --> 16:01.085
And why do you say that?

16:04.171 --> 16:05.381
Because I am one.

16:09.176 --> 16:11.595
-You're blind.
-I am.

16:14.181 --> 16:16.058
So how do you see the river?

16:16.141 --> 16:17.393
It is all here.

16:18.936 --> 16:23.691
Every turn and village,
sound and color from beginning to end.

16:24.608 --> 16:27.861
I was on it this morning
and the morning before that.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.029
Every morning.

16:41.875 --> 16:44.003
What would it take
for you to run it again?

16:45.713 --> 16:46.630
In person?

16:52.344 --> 16:53.512
A coat.

16:59.393 --> 17:02.021
-For me?
-For my betrothed.

17:04.189 --> 17:06.692
Is it a family design from Sussex?

17:08.068 --> 17:08.902
No.

17:10.446 --> 17:12.740
No, you will never see something
from that period.

17:12.823 --> 17:16.076
Sussex was stripped away
as punishment for my father's deeds.

17:17.119 --> 17:18.078
Everything?

17:18.162 --> 17:20.289
Almost everything.

17:21.749 --> 17:24.251
The king spared me my father's ring.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.004
I've never seen you wear it.

17:27.880 --> 17:28.881
And you never will.

17:30.340 --> 17:33.135
It was given to me
only as a reminder of my father's crime.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.054
I disposed of it when I left Sussex.

17:35.137 --> 17:39.099
This symbolizes our beginning.

17:41.435 --> 17:42.561
Not my past.

18:02.081 --> 18:03.665
Freydis!

18:06.251 --> 18:07.377
Freydis!

18:10.881 --> 18:11.924
Freydis!

18:18.180 --> 18:19.640
What is wrong?

18:20.933 --> 18:23.435
It is my daughter, Hrefna.

18:23.519 --> 18:27.147
They talked to her and now
she has disappeared into the woods.

18:27.231 --> 18:29.483
Something terrible has happened.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.946
You must help her. Please help her.

18:39.034 --> 18:40.494
What did you say to the girl?

18:42.079 --> 18:45.040
She wished to go to the boneyard.
I simply told her the way.

18:45.124 --> 18:49.002
You knew it was a dangerous journey
and you did nothing to stop her.

18:49.086 --> 18:50.546
It was you who encouraged her.

18:50.629 --> 18:53.298
Without your support
she wouldn't have known about it.

18:54.258 --> 18:56.677
Which way is this boneyard?

18:59.054 --> 19:00.097
Tell me.

19:01.390 --> 19:04.434
Were you ever a believer
in the old gods

19:05.269 --> 19:07.354
or simply a believer in Harekr?

19:26.456 --> 19:27.332
Your Highness.

19:29.877 --> 19:32.045
Is hanging an assassin
meant to be a warning

19:32.129 --> 19:34.339
to someone capable
of moving freely among us?

19:34.840 --> 19:36.925
It reminds them
that we've not stopped our search.

19:38.886 --> 19:41.138
What have your
alehouse informants told you?

19:42.431 --> 19:44.641
We're focusing
on the assassin's accomplices.

19:44.725 --> 19:45.809
How did he gain access?

19:46.602 --> 19:47.853
Have you made any progress?

19:48.437 --> 19:52.524
We will. Money is an excellent motivator
of the truth, Your Highness.

19:52.608 --> 19:54.902
And whoever is behind this
will make a mistake.

19:58.822 --> 19:59.907
Honestly, Gytha,

19:59.990 --> 20:03.327
it may be one of the worst things
that you could have an interest in them.

20:14.963 --> 20:15.797
No!

20:16.590 --> 20:18.842
Aelfwynn! Aelfwynn!

20:25.098 --> 20:28.268
-It's called an astrolabe.
-What does it do?

20:29.061 --> 20:30.312
Everything.

20:30.395 --> 20:32.689
It can tell you the time of day,

20:32.773 --> 20:36.860
measures the height of the Sun,
the Moon, the stars.

20:36.944 --> 20:40.864
Those are scales to calculate angles.

20:41.990 --> 20:43.367
Show me how to use it.

20:43.951 --> 20:45.744
You need to understand the diagrams.

20:49.581 --> 20:55.337
This tells you to align
this marking here with the polestar.

20:56.088 --> 20:58.131
Then using the other markings,

20:58.215 --> 21:01.426
you can measure the angle
and calculate your position.

21:02.261 --> 21:04.221
And know exactly where you are.

21:05.097 --> 21:06.223
Always.

21:08.725 --> 21:11.687
Can you teach me
how to understand these runes?

21:12.688 --> 21:14.898
Not runes. Letters.

21:14.982 --> 21:18.068
Letters make up an alphabet
used to spell words.

21:18.151 --> 21:21.363
And what about these? The, uh…

21:21.905 --> 21:23.532
Ah. That is different.

21:24.241 --> 21:25.409
That is mathematics.

21:26.034 --> 21:30.622
-Another language?
-The most beautiful language of all.

21:30.706 --> 21:36.420
When you understand mathematics,
you learn the secret to the world.

21:38.213 --> 21:39.589
Can you teach me all this?

21:41.091 --> 21:42.259
It would take years.

21:43.677 --> 21:45.971
It is three or four months
to Constantinople

21:46.054 --> 21:47.889
and I'm a willing student.

21:50.726 --> 21:52.352
I found a way to get you there.

21:54.646 --> 21:56.315
Now, it will not be easy,

21:57.107 --> 22:01.153
but I'll make sure you reach the south.

22:05.907 --> 22:06.783
Thank you.

22:09.578 --> 22:11.663
-He's a Pecheneg!
-He knows the river.

22:11.747 --> 22:14.124
It means he knows where to stop
and have us killed.

22:14.207 --> 22:16.209
Or where not to stop.

22:17.127 --> 22:18.754
The Pechenegs did this to me.

22:19.880 --> 22:23.258
I am sure whatever "this" is, is bad,

22:24.134 --> 22:29.222
but I cannot see how bad it is
because the Pechenegs did this to me.

22:35.020 --> 22:36.063
I am not your enemy.

22:37.147 --> 22:40.108
That I know my people well
is a good thing.

22:51.661 --> 22:53.622
You said nothing
of bringing a servant.

22:53.705 --> 22:55.123
Send him home.

22:55.207 --> 22:57.918
Need I remind you who paid for your furs?

23:00.212 --> 23:02.631
We will take a seat. Stow that.

23:14.434 --> 23:15.394
Yeah. I'll have it.

23:21.483 --> 23:23.318
A mighty fancy box you got there.

23:24.528 --> 23:27.906
Do not speak to my servant again
without my permission.

23:39.251 --> 23:40.377
Who's she?

23:40.460 --> 23:43.296
-She's Mariam. Mariam, this is Harald.
-Hello, Harald.

23:43.880 --> 23:45.215
After you.

23:48.009 --> 23:50.345
This is the reason
you're going to Constantinople?

23:50.429 --> 23:52.973
-It is. It is a good one.
-Huh, it better be.

23:53.723 --> 23:55.725
We need a strong crew
if we're going to make it.

23:55.809 --> 23:58.145
Not frail women and their belongings.

23:58.228 --> 23:59.187
I disagree.

23:59.771 --> 24:01.648
That is exactly what we need.

24:05.777 --> 24:07.821
-We're cold.
-Silence!

24:07.904 --> 24:09.489
We're all cold!

24:19.374 --> 24:21.376
I've taken your advice, Uncle.

24:22.669 --> 24:24.421
I'm reinventing myself.

24:24.504 --> 24:26.756
Yes, I see. As what?

24:28.091 --> 24:30.844
When I return,
I will be a rich and powerful man,

24:31.511 --> 24:33.305
with my own army and a purpose.

24:34.222 --> 24:35.474
You'll see.

24:36.308 --> 24:38.477
I am excited for that day.

24:38.560 --> 24:41.438
What do you want me to tell your brother
when he comes for you?

24:41.521 --> 24:44.900
Tell Olaf he should sleep
with an axe by his bed.

24:46.568 --> 24:49.821
Do not reinvent your confidence, nephew.
It is your great gift.

24:50.572 --> 24:51.656
May God be with you.

25:03.585 --> 25:10.300
A prince, a slaver,
a blind Pecheneg, a woman scholar,

25:10.383 --> 25:14.262
two con men and a noble,
on a boat on a sled.

25:15.222 --> 25:16.348
What could go wrong?

25:34.449 --> 25:35.700
Let's go.

25:39.538 --> 25:41.581
Go on!

26:20.495 --> 26:21.746
Let's go!

26:39.472 --> 26:41.308
I do not wish to tax you.

26:42.892 --> 26:45.854
Until the threat is over,
you're my only trusted helpers.

26:46.563 --> 26:48.523
Of course. You must not be alone.

26:49.608 --> 26:51.192
We are happy to be of service.

26:54.154 --> 26:57.616
Gytha, would you prepare my clothes?
Aelfwynn looks tired.

26:58.533 --> 26:59.701
Yes, Your Highness.

27:03.413 --> 27:07.042
I am sorry, Your Highness.
I've been distracted.

27:07.125 --> 27:10.378
Your eyes are red, Aelfwynn.
Are you unwell?

27:10.962 --> 27:12.922
I would not bring sickness to my queen.

27:14.299 --> 27:15.508
Then you've been crying.

27:16.217 --> 27:19.763
No. I'm very happy here.

27:21.806 --> 27:23.975
Your Highness has been very good to me.

27:32.525 --> 27:33.693
I'm glad you feel that way.

27:35.028 --> 27:36.154
I care about you.

27:37.614 --> 27:39.783
Which is why I've noticed a change in you.

27:43.495 --> 27:45.288
Is there something worrying you?

27:47.123 --> 27:49.125
Something you would like to share?

27:59.636 --> 28:02.055
I promise I will not allow this
to happen again.

28:06.810 --> 28:08.728
Your clothes are prepared,
my lady.

28:21.032 --> 28:22.742
I'm sorry, my love.

28:25.537 --> 28:26.746
It's just us.

28:28.206 --> 28:29.624
Are you all right?

28:29.708 --> 28:32.961
-Yes, just startled.
-Are you sure?

28:35.714 --> 28:37.632
You know you can tell me anything.

28:37.716 --> 28:40.176
I'm fine. I promise.

29:59.088 --> 30:00.381
Hrefna!

30:01.257 --> 30:02.258
In here.

30:24.572 --> 30:25.782
You're hurt.

30:26.783 --> 30:27.867
I'm all right.

30:28.952 --> 30:33.289
-What happened?
-There was a boar. But I drove it away.

30:37.961 --> 30:38.837
Freydis…

30:42.590 --> 30:43.758
A piece of Skuld.

30:46.177 --> 30:47.095
You did it.

30:48.263 --> 30:49.597
Will they let me keep it?

30:50.181 --> 30:53.184
Of course. You have earned it.

31:00.441 --> 31:01.776
I'll let you go.

31:11.452 --> 31:12.370
Run!

31:45.278 --> 31:46.112
Come.

31:47.405 --> 31:48.656
Let's get you home.

32:18.811 --> 32:19.646
Out.

32:31.032 --> 32:31.866
Out!

32:37.789 --> 32:40.583
His cargo. Not mine.

32:42.210 --> 32:43.461
Out!

32:45.964 --> 32:47.131
Out!

32:58.309 --> 32:59.727
No!

32:59.811 --> 33:02.438
No! Orlaith! No!

33:02.522 --> 33:04.232
No! Orlaith!

33:05.608 --> 33:08.486
Orlaith! Orlaith!

33:09.278 --> 33:10.947
Orlaith! No!

33:11.864 --> 33:12.782
No!

33:13.616 --> 33:17.829
No! Orlaith!

33:20.248 --> 33:23.251
Break my nose, lose more money on me.

34:34.906 --> 34:35.740
It's a pity.

34:36.574 --> 34:39.035
Two sisters
would have fetched a lot of money.

34:44.999 --> 34:46.250
We should say a prayer.

34:49.837 --> 34:51.339
It is a proper suggestion.

34:58.054 --> 34:59.430
You should offer it.

35:06.854 --> 35:08.106
Oh, Father in heaven.

35:09.315 --> 35:12.485
Be with your daughter, Orlaith,
as she journeys to your holy land.

35:14.153 --> 35:17.323
And be with her sister, Brigtoc,
in her grief.

35:18.741 --> 35:21.202
-Amen.
<i>-Āmīn.</i>

35:21.285 --> 35:22.620
-Amen
-Amen.

35:23.121 --> 35:23.955
Amen.

35:25.665 --> 35:27.750
-Amen.
-Amen.

35:30.419 --> 35:31.462
Amen.

35:35.007 --> 35:35.883
Amen.

35:45.143 --> 35:46.352
That's where I live.

35:50.314 --> 35:53.067
Hrefna, I'm so proud of you.

36:05.079 --> 36:05.997
Hrefna!

36:07.623 --> 36:08.708
Come.

36:16.549 --> 36:18.217
Inside. Come.

36:20.136 --> 36:21.721
What happened to your leg?

36:21.804 --> 36:23.389
It will heal. It's nothing.

37:20.655 --> 37:22.073
You must tell me the truth.

37:23.115 --> 37:24.158
You know this man.

37:26.369 --> 37:27.203
No.

37:28.829 --> 37:30.039
You're lying.

37:31.249 --> 37:34.126
I watched you collapse in the courtyard
when you saw the body.

37:35.253 --> 37:37.296
When I pressed you for answers
you evaded me.

37:37.380 --> 37:40.216
Please, don't ask me.

37:40.299 --> 37:41.300
I will.

37:43.261 --> 37:45.471
That man tried to kill me.

37:45.554 --> 37:47.014
How do you know him?

37:48.808 --> 37:50.184
Tell me.

37:53.521 --> 37:56.107
If I do, you must promise
not to tell Earl Godwin.

37:57.024 --> 37:59.819
Godwin? Why?

37:59.902 --> 38:02.488
He has proposed marriage to me, my lady.

38:03.823 --> 38:06.325
If he should find out
what I'm about to tell you,

38:07.785 --> 38:08.786
he will leave me.

38:09.453 --> 38:10.371
I'm sure.

38:13.582 --> 38:16.585
Marriage? I've scarce seen you together.

38:16.669 --> 38:21.882
We kept it a secret
until he received your husband's blessing.

38:24.760 --> 38:27.555
To be his wife, Your Highness,

38:28.681 --> 38:31.767
is more than I could hope.

38:35.396 --> 38:36.480
He loves me

38:38.190 --> 38:39.608
and I love him.

38:42.445 --> 38:47.366
Is there a connection
between this man and Earl Godwin?

38:48.784 --> 38:49.702
No.

38:55.041 --> 38:56.250
With me.

38:58.085 --> 38:59.295
He's my brother.

39:01.881 --> 39:03.132
I have not seen him in years.

39:03.215 --> 39:06.635
I did not know he was in London until
I saw him in that courtyard yesterday--

39:06.719 --> 39:10.514
Lies, you were in the chapel
when he tried to poison me.

39:10.598 --> 39:14.060
My head was bowed, my lady, as was yours.

39:14.143 --> 39:18.272
If I had seen him,
I would have reacted as I did yesterday.

39:18.898 --> 39:21.776
I swear!

39:22.610 --> 39:24.987
So you have not spoken
a word of this to Godwin?

39:25.071 --> 39:25.905
No.

39:30.993 --> 39:36.832
Please… Please do not tell him.

39:38.459 --> 39:40.002
If he finds out,

39:40.586 --> 39:45.424
he will abandon me
and I will lose everything.

41:23.647 --> 41:27.234
All-Father.
Thank you for guiding me here.
