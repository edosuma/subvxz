00:09.250 --> 00:10.416
<i>Palermo...</i>

00:10.500 --> 00:11.791
<i>this is war.</i>

00:12.291 --> 00:13.625
<i>Act accordingly.</i>

00:18.500 --> 00:19.583
Doors!

00:21.666 --> 00:22.958
Fire!

00:58.833 --> 01:01.458
<i>Everything can go to shit</i>
<i>in a split second.</i>

01:03.708 --> 01:06.583
<i>The moment you feel</i>
<i>death creeping in,</i>

01:07.375 --> 01:10.250
<i>you know nothing will ever be the same...</i>

01:12.916 --> 01:15.583
<i>and that you need to try your best</i>
<i>to survive.</i>

01:15.750 --> 01:17.708
<i>Nairobi, hang in there!</i>

01:21.666 --> 01:24.583
Hang in there. Hang in there, Nairobi.

01:25.666 --> 01:27.208
Come on.

01:27.708 --> 01:28.791
Let's go!

01:29.541 --> 01:32.625
<i>We all have snipers aiming at our hearts.</i>

01:33.791 --> 01:36.166
<i>But the true terror arrives</i>

01:36.250 --> 01:40.166
<i>when that bullet doesn't hit you...</i>
<i>but takes out someone you love.</i>

01:40.250 --> 01:41.083
Hurry up!

01:47.208 --> 01:48.250
Saline, Rio.

01:59.500 --> 02:00.500
Almost done.

02:06.125 --> 02:08.666
<i>The Professor was feeling</i>
<i>that terror the most.</i>

02:09.708 --> 02:14.500
<i>Two words that should never go together</i>
<i>collided in his heart: "love" and "death."</i>

02:15.541 --> 02:17.250
<i>That made him freeze up.</i>

02:18.000 --> 02:19.958
<i>As he ran through the woods...</i>

02:24.166 --> 02:26.125
<i>he couldn't stop thinking,</i>

02:27.125 --> 02:29.375
<i>"They've killed the woman I love."</i>

02:38.291 --> 02:39.666
<i>But Lisbon was there.</i>

02:40.875 --> 02:42.291
<i>She wasn't gone.</i>

02:43.250 --> 02:48.625
<i>The shots of her fake execution</i>
<i>had sounded real enough to the Professor.</i>

02:49.708 --> 02:52.666
<i>Our mastermind was losing his head</i>
<i>like never before.</i>

02:53.333 --> 02:54.583
<i>And along with him,</i>

02:55.916 --> 02:57.291
<i>we were losing ours.</i>

03:21.375 --> 03:23.375
Pulse: 155 and rising.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.750
Blood pressure: 85/40. It's dropping.

03:25.833 --> 03:29.291
-We need two units of blood and saline.
-Nairobi.

03:29.375 --> 03:30.958
Stay strong. I'm here.

03:38.208 --> 03:41.958
<i>In the tent,</i> <i>Tamayo felt what I felt.</i>

03:43.125 --> 03:45.250
<i>We were staring death in the face.</i>

03:49.041 --> 03:51.916
<i>A dry mouth.</i> <i>The taste of metal.</i>

03:52.541 --> 03:55.291
<i>Tightness in the chest</i>
<i>and pain in the temples.</i>

03:55.416 --> 03:59.208
<i>But until it was game over,</i>
<i>we still had everything to play for.</i>

04:07.000 --> 04:09.500
Blood at 30ºC, ready for transfusion.

04:26.875 --> 04:27.791
It's here.

04:28.375 --> 04:31.208
The bullet. Behind the seventh rib.

04:31.291 --> 04:33.458
It's in the lower part of the lung.

04:33.666 --> 04:35.958
That's good news, honey.

04:39.208 --> 04:41.458
She can't breathe. It's a collapsed lung.

04:41.541 --> 04:45.208
-We have to release air.
-Tokyo, surgical kit six.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.750
OK, surgical kit six.

04:46.833 --> 04:49.291
There's air between the lung
and chest wall.

04:49.375 --> 04:50.458
Hurry, Helsinki.

04:51.333 --> 04:53.125
-She can't breathe!
-Hurry up!

04:59.458 --> 05:00.416
There we go.

05:06.041 --> 05:07.166
Get me out of here.

05:09.791 --> 05:13.458
I'd rather be in prison alive.
I don't want to die.

05:15.750 --> 05:16.583
Tokyo...

05:18.500 --> 05:20.916
hand me over to the police, please.

05:23.000 --> 05:24.291
Please.

05:26.625 --> 05:27.833
Hand me over.

06:45.833 --> 06:48.500
STAGE 3

06:49.833 --> 06:51.458
RESISTANCE

06:53.666 --> 06:57.333
Once they hand over Rio,
we'll begin stage three of the plan:

06:58.375 --> 06:59.250
resistance.

07:03.916 --> 07:06.291
You can't get out
of the Bank of Spain alive.

07:08.250 --> 07:09.208
It's impossible.

07:10.916 --> 07:13.000
But I will get you out of there.

07:13.083 --> 07:15.916
Once we begin stage three,

07:16.500 --> 07:18.875
there'll only be one countdown:
the gold.

07:18.958 --> 07:21.458
And our only goal will be to melt it.

07:22.416 --> 07:24.916
Because the gold is the key.

07:25.333 --> 07:27.916
Without it,
I won't be able to get you out.

07:29.375 --> 07:30.500
The police...

07:31.750 --> 07:34.375
will react harshly, but it doesn't matter.

07:37.708 --> 07:38.833
Whatever happens,

07:39.916 --> 07:41.125
whatever they do...

07:43.541 --> 07:46.916
we need to be able to keep control.

07:49.916 --> 07:52.333
Otherwise, our lives will be in danger.

08:03.416 --> 08:05.208
Did we kill any officers?

08:05.666 --> 08:08.125
I don't know, but they were on fire.

08:08.208 --> 08:11.833
They'll come back all guns blazing.
We can't defend ourselves.

08:13.250 --> 08:15.083
And Nairobi needs a surgeon.

08:16.333 --> 08:19.083
We used an antitank gun.
They won't send one.

08:19.166 --> 08:21.375
She's got a bullet in her lung.

08:21.458 --> 08:24.750
<i>We can't do it ourselves.</i>
<i>You've got to try.</i>

08:25.791 --> 08:27.833
<i>We need the Pakistani surgeon.</i>

08:29.916 --> 08:32.166
-How much time do I have?
-She's dying.

08:33.291 --> 08:36.583
He has crampons, dog deterrent,
and camouflage clothes.

08:37.291 --> 08:41.625
He may be hiding among the branches.
Shoot up into the treetops.

08:57.125 --> 09:00.416
Raquel, don't let them get you alone.
Tell them I'll surrender.

09:01.250 --> 09:02.500
<i>Raquel!</i>

09:03.416 --> 09:04.750
<i>Get out of there!</i>

09:05.458 --> 09:06.625
<i>Get out of there!</i>

09:07.625 --> 09:08.791
Get out of there!

09:13.166 --> 09:14.416
I'm going to try.

09:52.500 --> 09:55.958
Easy.

09:57.375 --> 09:58.625
Easy.

10:00.666 --> 10:02.083
Good little bull.

10:04.125 --> 10:05.500
Easy.

10:06.666 --> 10:08.708
Easy.

10:09.083 --> 10:09.916
Eas...

10:21.541 --> 10:26.208
<i>The Professor is attacking the police,</i>
<i>but nobody is leaving the Bank of Spain.</i>

10:26.291 --> 10:28.958
<i>Demonstrators are in a state of shock.</i>

10:29.041 --> 10:32.166
<i>Will this affect public support</i>
<i>for the Dalís?</i>

10:32.250 --> 10:34.375
<i>For the moment, nobody can say.</i>

10:34.458 --> 10:38.458
<i>But we may be witnessing</i>
<i>the Professor's first big problem.</i>

10:39.291 --> 10:41.791
That was unreal,
the best we could hope for.

10:41.875 --> 10:44.750
Those men have
second- and third-degree burns.

10:44.833 --> 10:45.833
As expected.

10:45.916 --> 10:49.208
-We need another armored van.
-Don't you care about anything?

10:50.833 --> 10:54.250
I won't send more men
to be permanently disfigured!

10:54.333 --> 10:57.041
They fired rockets at us,
and everyone in Spain saw it.

10:57.125 --> 10:59.541
I'm not starting a war
in the center of Madrid.

10:59.625 --> 11:00.833
It's already started.

11:02.500 --> 11:03.583
Tamayo.

11:04.041 --> 11:06.625
Don't make
the biggest mistake of your life.

11:09.958 --> 11:12.250
My mistake was sending you
to torture that kid.

11:17.125 --> 11:19.791
If we'd taken him to court,
we wouldn't be here.

11:19.875 --> 11:22.750
We gave them strength and ammunition.
I won't do it again.

11:24.083 --> 11:24.916
You're scared.

11:31.333 --> 11:32.666
You're like Prieto.

11:33.333 --> 11:36.750
You've got pills on your nightstand
and erectile dysfunction.

11:37.000 --> 11:39.125
And you think the law will save you.

11:40.250 --> 11:41.791
The law can't help us now.

11:43.875 --> 11:45.166
I am the law.

11:46.000 --> 11:47.958
And erectile dysfunction, my ass!

11:49.666 --> 11:50.875
Maintain composure.

11:52.958 --> 11:58.333
Let's de-escalate the situation, OK?
Dialogue and truce. Truce and dialogue.

11:59.375 --> 12:00.291
Is that clear?

12:01.291 --> 12:03.041
Crystal clear, boss.

12:08.333 --> 12:11.958
Antoñanzas.

12:12.500 --> 12:13.625
Yes, Inspector?

12:13.708 --> 12:17.500
You heard that, right?
He is the law, like John Wayne.

12:19.750 --> 12:22.416
I want an ambulance and a surgeon.

12:23.291 --> 12:24.291
Now!

12:27.791 --> 12:30.458
Let's get them
to hand over their wounded.

12:36.958 --> 12:40.791
The governor studied medicine in the army.
He's going to help us.

12:40.875 --> 12:44.541
I didn't complete the course
or practice, obviously, but...

12:44.791 --> 12:46.458
I still know a few things.

12:46.666 --> 12:48.916
-Put on some scrubs.
-I'll go get them.

12:49.291 --> 12:50.791
Where's the damn surgeon?

12:50.875 --> 12:53.833
I'm trying to reach him,
but they have to give me access.

12:53.916 --> 12:55.250
Bogotá, anesthetic.

12:55.333 --> 12:59.791
-Nairobi, we're going to put you under.
-You're not putting me under. Tokyo.

13:01.333 --> 13:02.166
Tokyo...

13:02.958 --> 13:04.458
tell him it's my life...

13:05.083 --> 13:06.333
and I decide.

13:08.458 --> 13:11.583
That's exactly why
we're going to operate on you here.

13:11.666 --> 13:12.916
Tokyo, please.

13:13.791 --> 13:14.791
Please.

13:19.541 --> 13:20.375
She decides.

13:22.208 --> 13:23.375
Period.

13:26.041 --> 13:29.000
Helsinki, put her under.
That's a fucking order.

13:31.416 --> 13:34.541
You don't give me orders.
You're not my boss, asshole.

13:35.125 --> 13:36.583
You let the phone in.

13:37.375 --> 13:39.166
You're supposed to protect us.

13:39.666 --> 13:41.916
She can make mistakes, but you can't!

13:42.000 --> 13:44.666
Shut up, big man,
or I'll fucking kill you!

13:44.750 --> 13:45.750
Shut the fuck up.

13:46.333 --> 13:48.416
You're my little whore, not my mom.

13:48.500 --> 13:51.500
It's her fault she's in this state.
She's an idiot.

13:52.708 --> 13:55.791
If she says she's leaving,
I'll walk her to the door.

13:56.833 --> 14:00.208
And you'll keep your mouth shut,
you piece of shit,

14:00.291 --> 14:03.166
because from now on,
you're no longer my boss.

14:03.625 --> 14:04.750
Put the gun down.

14:04.833 --> 14:05.666
Denver.

14:06.000 --> 14:09.750
If she talks, they'll kill us all.
We're treating her in here.

14:12.875 --> 14:15.291
How are <i>you</i> going to treat her, dumbass?

14:15.375 --> 14:17.125
Nairobi needs a surgeon.

14:17.250 --> 14:19.083
Have you all gone nuts or what?

14:19.833 --> 14:23.625
I swear on my son's life...
I won't tell them anything.

14:23.708 --> 14:27.083
You think you won't,
but when they torture you, things change.

14:27.708 --> 14:28.916
I don't give a shit!

14:29.750 --> 14:31.000
She's leaving.

14:33.666 --> 14:34.666
I don't think so.

14:39.291 --> 14:42.333
Do you think
this is a good time for a rebellion?

14:42.416 --> 14:45.375
One of the gang is dying.
Stop fucking around!

14:47.833 --> 14:51.208
-Another one of the gang.
-What do you mean, another one?

14:55.958 --> 14:58.291
They killed Lisbon half an hour ago.

15:02.333 --> 15:04.833
I could show you my democratic side.

15:04.916 --> 15:08.125
We could vote and send her out,
but I'd be killing her.

15:08.208 --> 15:10.708
Lisbon was killed
on her knees and unarmed.

15:10.791 --> 15:12.333
They brought Nairobi's son

15:12.416 --> 15:15.416
with a teddy bear
to shoot her in the head.

15:15.500 --> 15:20.291
Do you think the Red Cross is outside?
You've got to be fucking kidding!

15:26.166 --> 15:27.333
Palermo is right.

15:29.458 --> 15:31.291
You'll have to open me up...

15:33.708 --> 15:35.083
and remove the bullet.

15:37.916 --> 15:38.791
Maybe...

15:39.750 --> 15:41.708
remove part of my lung.

15:42.500 --> 15:44.833
All that,
without me bleeding to death.

15:46.083 --> 15:47.541
You're going to kill me.

15:49.041 --> 15:50.458
You're going to kill me.

15:52.166 --> 15:53.250
Helsinki.

15:55.291 --> 15:56.583
It's too complicated.

15:57.791 --> 15:59.791
It's too complicated for you guys.

16:00.500 --> 16:01.708
Take me to the door.

16:01.791 --> 16:03.500
-Take me to the door.
-Relax.

16:04.083 --> 16:06.125
-Take me to the door.
-Calm down.

16:06.625 --> 16:08.625
-Calm down.
-Take me to the door.

16:08.708 --> 16:10.666
-I'm going.
-What are you doing?

16:12.000 --> 16:12.833
I'm going.

16:12.916 --> 16:15.375
No!

16:15.458 --> 16:16.916
No!

16:18.416 --> 16:20.625
No...

16:20.708 --> 16:23.541
No!

16:25.916 --> 16:27.916
No...

16:44.708 --> 16:48.291
Sorry, Professor. We had an argument.

16:49.583 --> 16:51.458
I was going to sleep in Tokyo's room.

16:59.000 --> 17:02.625
Are you sure you don't mind me sleeping
here with you?

17:04.333 --> 17:05.333
It's all right.

17:14.833 --> 17:18.166
But having someone in my bed
turns me on.

17:18.250 --> 17:19.291
Do you mind?

17:20.500 --> 17:22.083
Mind what?

17:22.166 --> 17:23.541
Releasing some stress.

17:24.583 --> 17:26.041
Rubbing our lamps.

17:31.541 --> 17:33.000
I knew you were joking.

17:35.708 --> 17:39.708
Can someone please tell me
why Palermo is in charge of the heist?

17:39.791 --> 17:41.500
Because it was his idea.

17:43.291 --> 17:45.291
-He's the mastermind.
-Mastermind?

17:45.416 --> 17:49.500
The guy who was grabbing his junk
in the hallway like an ape?

17:49.583 --> 17:51.125
Come on! Are you serious?

17:51.541 --> 17:53.625
You know who should be in charge?

17:56.041 --> 17:58.583
You. Yes, you.

17:59.500 --> 18:03.833
I agree. If anyone has a lot invested
in this going well, it's you.

18:05.916 --> 18:10.083
Don't egg me on.

18:10.708 --> 18:11.958
I'm going to sleep.

18:12.416 --> 18:13.458
Good night.

18:22.541 --> 18:26.041
I'm going to talk with the Professor.
You'll see.

18:30.416 --> 18:35.458
Professor, I want to be in charge...
of the heist. I'm better than Palermo.

18:35.541 --> 18:37.458
Can we talk about it tomorrow--

18:37.541 --> 18:39.416
No, not tomorrow, now.

18:40.125 --> 18:42.166
-Why's he in charge?
-Let's see.

18:42.250 --> 18:47.416
He... is in charge because this heist
has been in development for a long time.

18:47.500 --> 18:50.791
He's been involved since the start.
The plan's in his head.

18:50.875 --> 18:51.708
And?

18:53.375 --> 18:57.791
I can learn it. I'm a quick learner.
"Platero's a small, soft, hairy donkey,

18:57.875 --> 19:00.541
so soft you could say he's all cotton,
no bones."

19:03.916 --> 19:07.458
<i>-Platero and I. </i>By Juan Ramón Jiménez.
-We know.

19:07.708 --> 19:11.750
I don't know if you realize,
but you're spoiling an intimate moment.

19:18.458 --> 19:19.416
What is it?

19:20.916 --> 19:21.916
Are you horny?

19:22.000 --> 19:23.625
I was. Yes, I was.

19:24.208 --> 19:25.083
Oh, were you?

19:26.208 --> 19:28.416
I can't really imagine you two at it.

19:28.500 --> 19:30.000
You'd be quite surprised.

19:30.083 --> 19:31.250
Please...

19:31.333 --> 19:32.625
Wow, really?

19:36.458 --> 19:37.708
Want me to stay?

19:38.916 --> 19:39.750
No.

19:40.833 --> 19:41.750
What about you?

19:41.833 --> 19:43.750
Why are we talking about this?

19:43.833 --> 19:46.041
Because I'm proposing a threesome.

19:47.333 --> 19:48.916
Palermo, you, and me.

19:50.250 --> 19:54.166
He can do the numbers and calculations,
you can do the strategy.

19:54.750 --> 19:58.041
But I'm the best captain
you could have in there.

19:58.541 --> 20:01.791
Because when the going gets tough,
I react.

20:02.583 --> 20:05.833
That's not something you can study.
You're born with it.

20:12.416 --> 20:15.833
Ladies and gentlemen...
I'm taking command.

20:19.041 --> 20:20.083
Let's operate.

20:22.041 --> 20:26.250
She's taking charge, the mastermind,
the intelligent, level-headed one.

20:26.333 --> 20:30.625
The crazy bitch who brought us here
and cost some of us our lives. Great.

20:30.708 --> 20:33.125
I'll leave you all playing doctors.

20:34.041 --> 20:36.791
I'm going to think about my next move.
Careful.

20:48.958 --> 20:50.958
<i>It was our darkest half hour.</i>

20:52.041 --> 20:53.333
<i>In 30 minutes,</i>

20:53.625 --> 20:56.458
<i>the police had come back</i>
<i>with guns blazing,</i>

20:56.541 --> 20:58.666
<i>and they had us on the ropes.</i>

20:59.708 --> 21:04.666
<i>The Professor, under the trough,</i>
<i>was only thinking of those 30 minutes.</i>

21:06.000 --> 21:08.583
<i>If he could've called</i>
<i>half an hour earlier,</i>

21:09.291 --> 21:10.791
<i>Lisbon would be alive.</i>

21:31.291 --> 21:33.916
-Launch stage two of Hamelin.
-<i>All right.</i>

21:50.000 --> 21:51.500
PRIVATE NUMBER

21:54.000 --> 21:57.250
Alicia, empathy, dialogue, and truce.

22:01.291 --> 22:02.208
Professor.

22:02.291 --> 22:05.333
Five minutes as a widower,
and you're calling other women.

22:06.583 --> 22:09.083
Naughty boy. You're a ladies' man.

22:09.416 --> 22:13.416
-Did you order her execution?
-I didn't have time. She did it herself.

22:14.583 --> 22:16.875
<i>Murillo violently resisted arrest,</i>

22:16.958 --> 22:20.083
opening fire on her former colleagues,
like a traitor.

22:20.583 --> 22:21.416
Colonel.

22:24.333 --> 22:26.250
The cell tower isn't in Madrid.

22:33.416 --> 22:35.625
It's a national highway.

22:36.166 --> 22:37.208
In Huelva.

22:42.416 --> 22:44.583
<i>He's gotten through the cordon.</i>

22:44.666 --> 22:48.291
That bastard's on the move.
42 kilometers from your position.

22:48.375 --> 22:50.333
You sure? It may be another trap.

22:50.416 --> 22:53.375
I'm sure.
The signal bounced off three cell towers.

22:53.458 --> 22:56.416
Highway 435, northbound. Go get him.

22:56.500 --> 22:57.333
OK.

22:58.916 --> 23:01.500
Inspector Rubio to all units.
We're leaving.

23:01.583 --> 23:05.208
The target is escaping
on highway 435, northbound.

23:14.208 --> 23:15.541
Listen, Sierra.

23:16.750 --> 23:19.250
Before we're out of the Bank of Spain,

23:20.000 --> 23:21.833
we'll destroy you.

23:23.666 --> 23:24.666
So boring.

23:25.541 --> 23:27.791
You're not an ethics professor, right?

23:27.916 --> 23:30.833
No, you fired two rockets
in the center of Madrid,

23:30.916 --> 23:33.000
and now you're on Al-Qaeda's team.

23:33.083 --> 23:34.750
Bada bing, bada boom.

23:35.583 --> 23:40.041
I'll fix my mistakes. I'm offering you
the chance to do the same with yours.

23:40.208 --> 23:43.958
-Nairobi--
-No way! I won't send a surgeon in.

23:45.208 --> 23:48.625
But I can offer access to medical care.
Bring Nairobi out.

23:48.708 --> 23:50.916
I've got an ambulance waiting.

23:51.000 --> 23:54.875
I won't put her in the hands
of a torturer who tried to kill her.

23:56.291 --> 23:59.416
-Face the consequences.
-I'm trembling with fear.

24:02.333 --> 24:05.708
As a gesture of goodwill,
I'm offering you a truce.

24:05.791 --> 24:07.166
For the next 48 hours.

24:07.250 --> 24:10.875
That way, you can assess
how serious the wound is.

24:12.000 --> 24:13.208
Or let her die there.

24:13.291 --> 24:16.208
I accept the truce,
but let me tell you something.

24:17.041 --> 24:18.666
Nairobi will survive...

24:19.916 --> 24:21.458
with or without your help.

24:25.625 --> 24:26.791
Good.

24:29.083 --> 24:30.708
Let's catch that bastard.

25:25.833 --> 25:28.250
<i>And how will we get out of the epicenter?</i>

25:30.333 --> 25:32.041
Following the Hamelin plan.

25:35.875 --> 25:36.791
Tell me more.

25:40.625 --> 25:45.083
Marseille will play the pipe,
and all the rats will run after him.

25:48.250 --> 25:51.041
<i>We'll make them believe we've escaped.</i>

25:52.708 --> 25:53.875
Exactly.

25:53.958 --> 25:59.833
<i>We'll leave a false trail, but...</i>
<i>a believable one, backed up with evidence,</i>

25:59.916 --> 26:03.625
and they'll leave the place
where we're hiding.

26:03.708 --> 26:08.125
Then, when the predators have gone,
we'll climb down the trees like monkeys.

26:15.750 --> 26:18.583
Don't you think
it'll be the most beautiful reunion?

26:59.791 --> 27:01.541
Why'd you call me Mr. Potato Head?

27:02.666 --> 27:04.166
I don't know. Your gait.

27:04.250 --> 27:05.666
My gait? What gait?

27:05.750 --> 27:08.041
Because you're... sweet.

27:08.125 --> 27:10.541
Are you calling me sweet or fat?

27:10.625 --> 27:13.208
Don't answer.
I'd rather think I'm sweet.

27:14.416 --> 27:16.958
You really messed things up
calling me that.

27:17.041 --> 27:21.875
Word got around. Now Homicide,
Internal Affairs, and the court all know.

27:21.958 --> 27:24.875
I didn't know about memes
until I saw the Mr. Potato Head ones.

27:24.958 --> 27:26.625
I'm really sorry.

27:37.416 --> 27:41.000
Aren't you going to ask me...
why I got involved in this?

27:46.166 --> 27:47.083
No.

27:48.541 --> 27:50.458
I know you did it for love.

27:53.416 --> 27:56.916
When we get to Madrid,
they'll offer you a cooperation deal.

27:57.333 --> 27:58.166
I know.

28:00.291 --> 28:03.541
Armed robbery, breach of the peace,

28:03.625 --> 28:06.333
assaulting an officer,
possession of weapons,

28:06.416 --> 28:09.458
disclosure of secrets,
belonging to an armed group,

28:09.541 --> 28:10.625
and abduction.

28:11.416 --> 28:14.458
Abduction of the hostages
and of my own daughter.

28:18.833 --> 28:21.125
So, no matter what deal they offer me,

28:22.041 --> 28:25.250
even with the most
anti-establishment prosecutor,

28:25.333 --> 28:27.583
I'll do at least 30 years.

28:30.208 --> 28:32.291
So, I'm fucked,

28:33.250 --> 28:34.416
Mr. Potato Head.

28:38.750 --> 28:42.125
The instructions you give
must be clear and concise, OK?

28:42.208 --> 28:44.166
How many blood units do we need?

28:44.666 --> 28:46.875
Have three ready at room temperature.

28:47.291 --> 28:48.625
How many are there?

28:51.416 --> 28:53.250
-Three.
-OK, go and get more.

28:53.333 --> 28:54.875
O negative and A negative.

28:54.958 --> 28:58.375
Draw enough for three operations.
Ask if anyone's a doctor.

28:58.458 --> 28:59.875
Bogotá, go downstairs.

28:59.958 --> 29:02.500
It's our only way out of here.
Get melting.

29:09.083 --> 29:11.000
Being in charge suits you well.

29:11.083 --> 29:12.625
You lost the team's trust.

29:12.708 --> 29:16.250
Do you know what your only way out will be
once I'm not here?

29:18.958 --> 29:21.291
Walking out with your hands up, praying

29:21.375 --> 29:25.375
that there are so many cameras outside
that they won't shoot you.

29:25.458 --> 29:28.958
<i>Messieurs... au revoir.</i>

29:29.416 --> 29:30.250
Bye.

29:35.458 --> 29:36.583
Go ahead, Doctor.

29:37.125 --> 29:42.041
<i>A 15-centimeter incision</i>
<i>between the sixth and seventh ribs.</i>

29:42.125 --> 29:43.041
Scalpel.

29:45.708 --> 29:50.416
This time, if anyone gets injured,
we'll be ready to save their life.

29:51.125 --> 29:55.166
We'll learn the protocols
for the most common gunshot wound cases.

29:55.250 --> 29:58.333
In the truck,
apart from what we need for the heist,

29:59.833 --> 30:03.791
we'll also carry medical supplies
to carry out any kind of surgery.

30:05.500 --> 30:08.833
<i>Dr. Ahmed will be the brains,</i>
<i>but he'll be 7,000 km away.</i>

30:08.916 --> 30:10.166
<i>You'll be the hands.</i>

30:11.000 --> 30:12.291
<i>And it won't be easy.</i>

30:13.541 --> 30:15.000
You can't hesitate.

30:16.458 --> 30:17.416
You can't fail.

30:18.666 --> 30:21.208
Because it won't be
a dead pig on the table.

30:26.000 --> 30:27.375
It'll be one of you.

30:28.708 --> 30:31.916
<i>-Suction. I can't see.</i>
-Bring the camera closer.

30:32.000 --> 30:35.416
Always keep the surgical area clean.

30:35.833 --> 30:37.250
-I can see.
-Next step?

30:37.666 --> 30:39.458
<i>We need to separate the ribs.</i>

30:40.000 --> 30:43.250
<i>You may have to remove part of the lung.</i>

30:43.333 --> 30:45.000
Separate the ribs? Fuck me.

30:46.125 --> 30:47.666
The rib spreader.

30:54.333 --> 30:56.333
-Is this it?
-Yes, bring it here.

31:04.500 --> 31:08.916
Those with blood types O negative or
A negative, raise your hands.

31:14.000 --> 31:17.333
Are you going to make us
check your medical records?

31:21.416 --> 31:24.958
Paquita.
You were a nurse's aide, weren't you?

31:25.041 --> 31:26.625
Yes, sir. And a midwife.

31:26.708 --> 31:28.000
Come with me.

31:28.083 --> 31:31.500
Everyone with their hand raised,
come with me now!

32:01.458 --> 32:02.458
Hello.

32:03.000 --> 32:04.208
Professor.

32:04.291 --> 32:06.541
-Marseille!
-Yes, it's me. Don't worry.

32:10.666 --> 32:12.833
-The cops aren't here.
-Where's the bull?

32:13.416 --> 32:16.000
-What bull?
-Help me up. I'm stiff.

32:26.291 --> 32:27.583
That bull?

32:28.500 --> 32:29.583
That bull.

32:31.250 --> 32:34.000
Start walking backwards
very slowly, Marseille,

32:34.958 --> 32:37.166
and don't break eye contact.

32:38.708 --> 32:40.708
Does this remind you of something?

32:41.041 --> 32:42.041
San Fermín?

32:44.291 --> 32:45.166
Italy.

32:45.250 --> 32:47.833
When I met you, at the wedding.

32:47.916 --> 32:49.625
Come on, farther back.

32:50.791 --> 32:53.458
Isn't the bouquet thing for single women?

32:53.875 --> 32:56.041
Do you see any single women here?

32:56.125 --> 32:58.166
You're the closest thing we have.

32:58.875 --> 33:01.208
Tradition says the bride has to throw it,

33:01.291 --> 33:03.666
and that's what I'm doing.
Farther back.

33:03.750 --> 33:04.875
Come on, move.

33:05.625 --> 33:07.625
A welder, a gay guy,

33:08.208 --> 33:09.875
a mute, and a librarian.

33:10.833 --> 33:13.041
Fucking hell, this Italian wedding...

33:13.458 --> 33:15.666
I'm not a mute. I'm just quiet.

33:15.750 --> 33:17.958
I told you, I'm not a librarian.

33:18.041 --> 33:20.125
Please just call me Sergio.

33:20.208 --> 33:23.125
Ladies, the bride's throwing the bouquet.
Focus!

33:23.208 --> 33:26.208
Come on, farther back, girls!
Just a bit more.

33:26.958 --> 33:28.041
Farther back!

33:48.708 --> 33:49.541
<i>Ready?</i>

33:54.958 --> 33:56.625
My little brother!

33:56.708 --> 33:59.500
<i>-Bravissimo,</i> little brother.
-Congratulations.

34:00.625 --> 34:03.500
Mrs. Fonollosa,
it's time for the first dance.

34:03.583 --> 34:07.041
-But first... a little surprise.
-What is it?

35:41.041 --> 35:43.833
That's what I call a choir!

35:47.583 --> 35:50.250
<i>Like anyone with no sense of rhythm,</i>

35:50.333 --> 35:52.250
<i>the Professor sat at the table.</i>

35:52.583 --> 35:53.916
<i>There he wondered,</i>

35:54.541 --> 35:58.208
<i>which carries more weight: love or death?</i>

35:58.666 --> 36:00.500
<i>Life carries the most weight.</i>

36:01.583 --> 36:02.541
Life.

36:04.000 --> 36:06.833
Then there's me.
Dying but still getting married.

36:09.541 --> 36:11.708
Isn't it a beautiful contradiction?

36:16.125 --> 36:17.708
Does she know you're sick?

36:18.041 --> 36:19.750
Of course she does.

36:22.500 --> 36:23.625
She's very smart.

36:26.125 --> 36:28.916
And if you look on the bright side,
we're lucky.

36:30.333 --> 36:32.791
Most people don't know
when their time will come.

36:33.500 --> 36:36.500
We get to stay
in the honeymoon period forever.

36:39.416 --> 36:42.875
People buy a bottle of champagne
for a special occasion

36:42.958 --> 36:44.458
and go back to their routines.

36:44.541 --> 36:49.000
Tatiana and I will live life to the limit
with a barrel of French champagne.

36:57.125 --> 37:00.375
Death can be
the best opportunity of your life, Sergio.

37:19.083 --> 37:20.291
Sad, Professor?

37:24.208 --> 37:27.416
If you want,
you can talk to me about feelings.

37:28.375 --> 37:30.000
Should I put some music on?

37:31.125 --> 37:33.125
Music cheers you up.

37:43.708 --> 37:45.875
The car's stolen. The music isn't mine.

37:45.958 --> 37:48.625
It doesn't matter, Marseille.
Keep driving.

38:07.958 --> 38:09.000
Excuse me.

38:10.166 --> 38:11.708
Who is the blood for?

38:12.500 --> 38:14.458
Why the fuck do you care?

38:14.541 --> 38:18.500
Two of you went upstairs with the bear,
but only one of you is here.

38:18.583 --> 38:20.791
Then you already know who it's for.

38:21.416 --> 38:22.666
Now let's stay quiet.

38:31.250 --> 38:32.583
-Denver.
-What?

38:35.166 --> 38:36.000
Thank you.

38:37.041 --> 38:40.708
-What for?
-I came in just to tell you in person.

38:42.916 --> 38:45.833
I know we didn't start off
on the right foot,

38:45.916 --> 38:49.875
but what matters
is that you've raised my son.

38:49.958 --> 38:53.000
-Thank you.
-What are you talking about, jerk?

38:57.416 --> 38:59.708
That'll do, Paquita. Thank you.

39:02.250 --> 39:04.916
At your age and with all that money...

39:07.000 --> 39:09.958
changing diapers
probably wasn't part of your plan.

39:10.041 --> 39:11.291
That does you credit.

39:11.375 --> 39:13.333
Because it takes a real man

39:13.416 --> 39:17.583
to look after a kid who was born
from another man's sperm.

39:17.666 --> 39:19.166
Look, freak.

39:20.000 --> 39:21.625
Be quiet. Don't rile me up,

39:21.708 --> 39:23.875
or you'll be eating my fist
till Christmas.

39:24.833 --> 39:27.708
He isn't. He's not A negative.

39:27.791 --> 39:29.291
Arturo is A positive.

39:30.500 --> 39:31.750
What were you doing?

39:33.000 --> 39:35.208
What were you doing?
I tested them by chance.

39:35.291 --> 39:36.750
We could've killed her.

39:39.416 --> 39:40.458
I'm sorry.

39:40.541 --> 39:43.583
Sorry. Shit, I was wrong.
I didn't do it on purpose.

39:43.666 --> 39:47.458
I know I'm A something. I didn't know
if it was positive or negative.

39:47.541 --> 39:49.958
It's not something you use every day.
I'm sorry.

39:50.041 --> 39:52.166
You're confused now, is that it?

39:56.791 --> 39:59.291
-What are you doing?
-What do you mean?

39:59.625 --> 40:01.541
Maybe he really was confused.

40:03.333 --> 40:06.875
-Help him, for Christ's sake!
-Get up. He's OK. Get up.

40:07.333 --> 40:10.291
You can't go around
punching people like that.

40:10.375 --> 40:15.166
-It's enough that they're trapped here.
-It's over. He's OK. I'm sorry.

40:15.875 --> 40:18.416
It's OK.

40:19.583 --> 40:20.416
Besides...

40:23.708 --> 40:26.166
I know exactly why you're so pissed off.

40:26.250 --> 40:28.458
-Why?
-I get it.

40:28.541 --> 40:31.166
Mónica told you about the bathroom,
right?

40:31.250 --> 40:32.333
What bathroom?

40:33.541 --> 40:35.916
What bathroom is he talking about?

40:36.000 --> 40:39.000
I apologize. For Christ's sake, I'm sorry.

40:39.083 --> 40:41.250
I don't know what I was thinking.

40:41.333 --> 40:44.750
I hadn't seen her or had her close
for such a long time...

40:44.833 --> 40:46.875
I don't know, I misread the signs.

40:46.958 --> 40:48.875
And she told me...

40:49.375 --> 40:52.500
that we could meet somewhere
so I could see my kid.

40:52.583 --> 40:55.333
One thing led to another,
and I went for it.

40:55.416 --> 40:56.625
He went for what?

40:57.208 --> 41:00.041
-What did he go for?
-Denver, nothing happened.

41:00.125 --> 41:02.458
Let it go.

41:03.458 --> 41:06.791
Were you going to meet this jerk
to show him our son?

41:06.875 --> 41:10.166
He confused me, saying he was his father.
He was upset--

41:10.250 --> 41:13.500
OK, but... what did he go for?
I don't get it.

41:13.583 --> 41:17.333
It wasn't her fault.
Leave her out of it. I'm the one to blame.

41:17.416 --> 41:20.125
We hugged... I got aroused...

41:20.208 --> 41:21.666
-I held her--
-Shut up!

41:22.666 --> 41:23.583
Is that true?

41:25.833 --> 41:30.333
Did this son of a bitch
rub himself against you...<i> </i>with a hard-on?

41:30.416 --> 41:33.625
I pushed him off right away with the gun.

41:34.750 --> 41:37.166
Listen to me. I fought back, Denver.

41:38.166 --> 41:39.416
So it's true.

41:45.916 --> 41:47.750
Stop, Denver!

41:50.250 --> 41:53.916
Stop, you're going to kill him,
Denver! Stop!

42:14.291 --> 42:15.833
What the fuck is this?

42:18.416 --> 42:21.083
What the fuck do you have inside of you?

42:21.833 --> 42:23.291
All that rage...

42:25.416 --> 42:27.583
All that violence...

42:27.666 --> 42:30.375
You shot a hostage.

42:31.708 --> 42:33.291
And now you beat him up...

42:34.916 --> 42:36.000
like a maniac.

42:37.000 --> 42:37.958
I can't...

42:39.458 --> 42:44.500
I don't know what your trauma is
or where it came from,

42:44.583 --> 42:46.416
but I can't, Denver.

42:49.125 --> 42:51.083
I can't, and I don't want...

42:52.250 --> 42:55.500
I don't want my son...

42:56.166 --> 42:59.375
to feel that rage you carry inside.

43:01.208 --> 43:02.458
I don't want that.

43:20.333 --> 43:21.791
Correct. Continue.

43:29.666 --> 43:31.333
-Good morning.
-Good morning.

43:31.791 --> 43:34.333
-Is it him?
-The car rolled several times.

43:34.416 --> 43:37.666
There are traces of blood and no driver.
It must be him.

43:37.750 --> 43:39.750
Or a dealer, or someone undocumented...

43:39.833 --> 43:42.166
The car was stolen just hours ago
in Salvatierra,

43:42.250 --> 43:45.208
the town closest
to where we found Murillo.

43:45.708 --> 43:47.041
And they climb trees.

43:48.250 --> 43:49.083
I see.

43:50.583 --> 43:51.791
Excuse me.

43:58.125 --> 43:59.875
-Yes, Colonel?
-<i>Was it him?</i>

44:00.458 --> 44:03.791
I think so. He can't be far.
He's lost a lot of blood.

44:03.875 --> 44:07.208
Let Suárez deal with it.
I need you here with Murillo.

44:07.291 --> 44:10.125
Bring her to Madrid.
That's more important. OK?

44:10.208 --> 44:12.500
-Understood.
-<i>Get Suárez to send units</i>

44:12.583 --> 44:14.583
to all the hospitals in the area,

44:14.666 --> 44:17.833
to every vet,
to every nun with a first aid kit.

44:18.750 --> 44:23.250
I want everyone alert. If we lose him,
it'd better be because he's dead.

44:29.833 --> 44:30.958
Pamuk.

44:36.125 --> 44:36.958
What?

44:37.500 --> 44:39.041
My dog was called Pamuk.

44:39.875 --> 44:43.875
Pamuk was with me during the war.
I know how you feel.

44:43.958 --> 44:49.208
Are you making some kind of metaphor
with your dead dog and my partner?

44:49.291 --> 44:50.541
She was a female dog.

44:52.708 --> 44:57.083
After the war, all my friends were dead.

44:58.000 --> 45:02.000
And I... spent my nights in a bar.

45:02.500 --> 45:04.708
One day, another day...

45:05.750 --> 45:08.916
Pamuk was always outside waiting.

45:10.916 --> 45:14.291
Did you also fall in love
only to have her killed in front of you?

45:17.083 --> 45:17.916
Yes.

45:23.750 --> 45:25.208
What happened to Pamuk?

45:29.333 --> 45:33.125
The boys from the village...
liked to play war.

45:34.750 --> 45:36.625
After a while,

45:37.208 --> 45:41.458
without an enemy,
they got bored of playing war.

45:42.458 --> 45:45.583
One day... they found some stones.

45:47.458 --> 45:49.458
They broke bottles.

45:51.875 --> 45:55.125
And they said Pamuk was the enemy.

45:59.916 --> 46:00.833
I'm sorry.

46:05.250 --> 46:06.916
She was a good dog.

46:13.875 --> 46:17.083
Marseille, can you stop a minute?
I need to... urinate.

47:45.500 --> 47:46.541
Good piss?

47:51.125 --> 47:53.250
Peeing is a relief sometimes.

48:03.750 --> 48:08.125
<i>However great the pain,</i>
<i>we could not lose sight of one thing.</i>

48:09.000 --> 48:13.666
<i>Our lives depended on what was happening</i>
<i>48 meters below the ground.</i>

48:13.875 --> 48:15.958
<i>The plan had a very simple rule:</i>

48:17.000 --> 48:20.791
<i>either we got all the gold out of there,</i>
<i>or we were all dead.</i>

48:22.250 --> 48:25.916
<i>No matter what was going on above,</i>
<i>we had to get the gold out.</i>

48:26.166 --> 48:30.000
<i>No matter what was going on above,</i>
<i>we had to get the gold out.</i>

48:34.625 --> 48:37.416
<i>Move the lung.</i>
<i>I want to see the lower part.</i>

48:37.500 --> 48:38.458
Okay.

48:39.250 --> 48:40.541
<i>Use your hand.</i>

48:44.625 --> 48:45.458
Colonel!

48:48.208 --> 48:50.916
There's an increased flow
of electromagnetic signals

48:51.000 --> 48:52.750
going in and out of the bank.

48:52.833 --> 48:57.250
-Martínez, in layman's terms.
-They're communicating with the outside.

49:02.625 --> 49:05.208
<i>Move the image closer. OK.</i>

49:05.666 --> 49:08.541
OK, we need to remove
the lower part of the lung.

49:08.666 --> 49:10.791
<i>Risk of infection and necrosis.</i>

49:10.875 --> 49:12.000
<i>It could kill her.</i>

49:12.083 --> 49:14.666
How are we gonna cut
part of her lung out?

49:15.041 --> 49:17.083
<i>-Do you have an electric scalpel?</i>
-Yes.

49:17.166 --> 49:20.791
-From its size, I'd say it's a video call.
-Can we watch it?

49:21.125 --> 49:25.916
The signal is encrypted. I'd say
it's going through a Kazakh satellite...

49:27.833 --> 49:31.500
then probably through the deep web.
It's impossible to be sure.

49:34.125 --> 49:35.666
Let's take it down, then.

49:38.166 --> 49:40.375
<i>Let's do it. No time to waste.</i>

49:40.458 --> 49:43.166
<i>Listen and follow my instructions closely.</i>

49:44.125 --> 49:47.083
<i>-We'll go slowly. Understood?</i>
-Understood.

49:47.166 --> 49:51.416
Colonel... if it were
a Spanish phone company satellite,

49:51.500 --> 49:55.166
-we'd request a jam--
-Don't tell me what we can't do.

49:55.250 --> 49:57.416
I told you to cut off the damn call.

49:57.500 --> 50:00.750
<i>If you cut a vein, we stop the scalpel</i>

50:00.833 --> 50:04.000
<i>-and close it with Kocher forceps.</i>
-Understood.

50:04.083 --> 50:06.625
We'd have to jam the signals in the area,

50:06.708 --> 50:09.833
take down the Internet
and anything using satellite.

50:09.916 --> 50:13.208
Like in Egypt in 2011. Do it.

50:14.500 --> 50:16.583
<i>Let's make the first incision.</i>

50:16.666 --> 50:18.833
<i>-See the lingula?</i>
-What's that?

50:18.916 --> 50:20.416
<i>Lower part--</i>

50:22.875 --> 50:24.750
-What?
-You've gotta be kidding.

50:28.958 --> 50:29.791
What's wrong?

50:33.000 --> 50:34.750
-There's no return signal.
-What?

50:34.833 --> 50:35.916
Fuck!

50:38.791 --> 50:41.208
There's no signal. Everything is down.

50:42.083 --> 50:43.083
What do we do?

50:43.166 --> 50:45.958
Blood pressure is dropping.
We're losing her.

50:46.041 --> 50:47.083
No.

50:47.750 --> 50:49.625
No, fuck!
