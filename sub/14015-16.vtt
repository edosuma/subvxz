00:01.068 --> 00:02.808
NARRATOR:
In the criminal justice system

00:02.870 --> 00:06.720
the people are represented by two
separate yet equally important groups,

00:06.773 --> 00:08.653
the police
who investigate crime

00:08.709 --> 00:11.489
and the district attorneys
who prosecute the offenders.

00:11.545 --> 00:13.315
These are their stories.

00:14.147 --> 00:18.427
Honestly, they're still not
answering at the bakery, Dad.

00:18.485 --> 00:21.295
I bet they've gone home and completely
forgotten about Carrie's cake.

00:21.355 --> 00:22.765
(CHATTERING ON TV)
Probably stuck in traffic.

00:22.823 --> 00:24.603
Well, they were supposed
to be here an hour ago.

00:24.658 --> 00:27.638
How long can it possibly take
to drive 15 blocks?

00:27.694 --> 00:29.574
Mom, it's just a cake.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.601
I'll call Bill
on his car phone.

00:32.665 --> 00:34.666
He can stop by and pick up
the cake on his way home.

00:34.735 --> 00:36.505
(GUN FIRING) Sally.

00:36.870 --> 00:38.370
What was that?

00:42.042 --> 00:43.212
Someone's lying
on the sidewalk.

00:43.277 --> 00:46.587
Dad, for God's sake...
Stay inside. And call 911.

00:47.514 --> 00:49.464
(nos BARKING)

00:51.652 --> 00:53.032
Oh. My God!

00:55.355 --> 00:58.625
Sally! It's Bill.

00:59.793 --> 01:00.833
(SIREN WAILING)

01:00.894 --> 01:03.974
The guy's name is William Prescott.
His father-in-law found him.

01:04.031 --> 01:05.171
Where's the father-in-law?

01:05.232 --> 01:07.942
He's inside with Prescott's wife.
Couple of kids in there, too.

01:08.001 --> 01:09.881
I'll catch you up there.

01:09.937 --> 01:13.977
Two in the back. No exit wounds.
Any witnesses?

01:14.041 --> 01:17.051
Everybody had something better to do.
I bet.

01:17.978 --> 01:19.418
(SIGHING) Okay.

01:19.980 --> 01:23.220
Well, grab a couple of guys,
ring some doorbells.

01:23.283 --> 01:25.133
Tell the patrol sergeant
I want him

01:25.185 --> 01:28.255
to get people looking for that
weapon and shell casings.

01:30.891 --> 01:33.001
That his bag?
Yeah. Birthday present.

01:33.060 --> 01:36.370
Guy with his hands full,
easy pickings for a mugger.

01:41.268 --> 01:43.908
Looks like
he didn't pick hard enough.

02:35.956 --> 02:39.366
There was no one out there.
It was freezing.

02:39.426 --> 02:40.926
I can't believe this!

02:40.994 --> 02:44.464
BRISCOE: He was coming
home from work? Yes.

02:44.531 --> 02:47.641
He's with Latham Morris
in Rockefeller Center.

02:47.701 --> 02:49.541
They're an accounting firm.

02:49.603 --> 02:54.353
What, does he usually take a cab home?
No. A private car service.

02:54.408 --> 02:58.948
He always has the same driver.
Eugene. His name's Eugene.

02:59.012 --> 03:01.322
I told Bill he shouldn't
be living in Manhattan.

03:01.381 --> 03:05.521
Especially not this far up. Why is that?
Is it too far from work?

03:06.186 --> 03:08.826
Too close
to where those animals live.

03:09.489 --> 03:12.869
They don't care who they kill.
(CRYING) Oh, God.

03:14.261 --> 03:16.941
It's Carrie's 10th birthday.

03:16.997 --> 03:19.197
How could they do this to us?

03:24.204 --> 03:27.744
I picked him up 7:30 every
night in front of 15 Rock.

03:27.808 --> 03:30.018
A town car every night?

03:30.277 --> 03:32.347
Not too shabby for a CPA.

03:32.412 --> 03:34.982
No. He wasn't just
some storefront tax wonk.

03:35.048 --> 03:38.858
Mr. Prescott had a black belt in accounting.
He played with the big boys.

03:38.919 --> 03:40.489
Well, when you dropped him off,

03:40.554 --> 03:44.634
did you notice any suspicious-looking
urban youths hanging around?

03:44.691 --> 03:46.361
No. He had me drop him
on the corner.

03:46.426 --> 03:49.866
And traffic was bad, and he didn't want
me to have to drive around the block.

03:49.930 --> 03:51.240
He was a nice guy like that.

03:51.298 --> 03:54.838
So last night, business as usual?
That's right.

03:54.901 --> 03:57.041
Nobody was after us.
Nobody was following us.

03:57.104 --> 03:59.354
I checked the rearview mirror,
it's part of my job.

03:59.406 --> 04:01.646
Checking the rearview,
is that Prescott's idea?

04:01.708 --> 04:05.548
No. It's company policy. Our
clients are worth a lot of money.

04:06.113 --> 04:10.083
The ME pulled two .32 H&R mags
out of Prescott's body.

04:10.150 --> 04:11.420
One's still perfect.

04:11.485 --> 04:14.725
Ballistics tagged the piece as a
Charter Arms Police Undercover.

04:14.788 --> 04:17.168
Not your average
Saturday night special.

04:17.224 --> 04:19.863
Have Ballistics run a
comparison with old cases.

04:19.926 --> 04:23.666
You said Mr. Prescott kept a schedule?
Yeah. He sure did.

04:24.931 --> 04:27.881
Picked up at 7:30 p.m.,
home by 8:00 p.m.

04:27.934 --> 04:29.814
Every night
for the past six years.

04:29.870 --> 04:31.440
Any pro could set
his watch by him.

04:31.505 --> 04:35.645
BRISCOE: And why a pro? Maybe Prescott
ran into a junkie with a cash problem.

04:35.709 --> 04:37.849
And left the solution
in Prescott's wallet?

04:37.911 --> 04:40.321
All right, Prescott throws him
a few bucks out of his pocket,

04:40.380 --> 04:42.220
and the perp
wasn't happy with the count.

04:42.282 --> 04:43.892
Prescott was shot from behind.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.450
You think he turned his back
on a mugger with a gun?

04:46.520 --> 04:48.830
No one's that brave
at 8:00 at night.

04:48.889 --> 04:50.329
He did what for a living?

04:50.390 --> 04:53.200
Very dangerous work.
He was an accountant.

04:53.994 --> 04:57.704
Maybe somebody didn't like where
he put his decimal points.

05:01.468 --> 05:04.108
It's a terrible blow
to the firm.

05:04.171 --> 05:09.121
Mr. Prescott was our white knight,
our turnaround specialist.

05:09.476 --> 05:11.386
Well, you lost me on that.

05:11.444 --> 05:14.584
He put companies back on their
feet by trimming the fat.

05:14.648 --> 05:17.628
You know, with personnel,
factories, assets.

05:17.684 --> 05:21.194
And since I've been with him, I watched him
pull six companies back from the brink.

05:21.254 --> 05:24.334
As of Tuesday, what company did
he have on the operating table?

05:24.391 --> 05:25.731
Colony Air.

05:25.792 --> 05:29.502
He was shifting Colony's hub from
Newark to a right-to-work state.

05:29.563 --> 05:32.913
So he told the unions that they'd
either have to move and take a pay cut,

05:32.966 --> 05:34.966
or find themselves out of work.

05:35.435 --> 05:36.875
What a wonderful choice.

05:36.937 --> 05:40.207
Colony Air was on its way
to corporate boot hill.

05:40.273 --> 05:43.053
All unions care about
are sick days and overtime.

05:43.109 --> 05:45.349
Careful. We belong to a union.

05:46.580 --> 05:48.990
You ever burn anyone in effigy?

05:49.583 --> 05:52.833
That's what the baggage handlers
did last week to Mr. Prescott.

05:52.886 --> 05:56.026
Were there ever any threats
of a less symbolic nature?

05:56.089 --> 05:58.069
Yeah. The usual phone calls.

05:58.124 --> 05:59.434
They even had
their filthy-mouth kids

05:59.492 --> 06:01.132
call and leave
a message for Mr. Prescott.

06:01.194 --> 06:04.074
And I quote,
"You're dead, you bastard."

06:04.130 --> 06:06.410
I don't suppose
anybody ever left a number?

06:06.466 --> 06:09.566
As a matter of fact,
one of them left his name.

06:09.636 --> 06:13.706
He called here a few times.
He was very agitated.

06:14.908 --> 06:18.358
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Here it is. Harrigan.

06:18.411 --> 06:20.021
Very rough-sounding
individual.

06:20.080 --> 06:23.030
Claimed that he had to talk to
Mr. Prescott and said it was personal.

06:23.083 --> 06:26.263
Well, some people take losing
their jobs very personally.

06:27.621 --> 06:30.831
That bag of slime, Prescott,
he provoked us plenty.

06:30.891 --> 06:33.931
Not only is he screwing us, but he
won't even tell it to our face.

06:33.994 --> 06:37.744
Last week, he cancels a meeting
with us for some personal business,

06:37.797 --> 06:40.567
like getting
his tennis racket re-strung.

06:40.634 --> 06:42.744
My guys are still pissed.

06:42.802 --> 06:46.082
So what, they barbecued a
dummy in front of his office?

06:46.139 --> 06:49.949
Now that's called an exercise of free speech.
It is not a crime.

06:50.477 --> 06:52.457
(PAGER BEEPING)

06:53.813 --> 06:56.923
Mind if I use your phone? Yeah.
Out in the back, on the desk.

06:56.983 --> 06:59.363
And have you got a member
named Harrigan?

06:59.419 --> 07:01.129
Harrigan? No.

07:01.187 --> 07:04.657
Maybe you'd like to check your files
before you trip and hurt yourself.

07:04.724 --> 07:07.434
Look, what is the point of
killing a guy like Prescott?

07:07.494 --> 07:08.504
He'll be gone a minute,

07:08.561 --> 07:10.631
and another suit will pick up
where he left off.

07:11.298 --> 07:12.708
Hey, Lennie.

07:14.501 --> 07:17.541
So that was Ballistics.
They got a match on the slug.

07:17.604 --> 07:19.644
The same gun
that killed Prescott

07:19.706 --> 07:22.516
put three bullets in a
liquor store clerk last May.

07:22.575 --> 07:24.315
They know who worked the case?

07:24.377 --> 07:26.357
Detective Styles, in the fifth.

07:27.847 --> 07:30.087
Madison Street Liquors?
No. That one never went down.

07:30.150 --> 07:33.530
You never found the guy? No,
we collared him. Jimmy Rose.

07:33.587 --> 07:35.087
Shot the clerk
without even a "hands up."

07:35.155 --> 07:38.525
Our eyewitness got cold feet
on the stand. Jury acquitted.

07:38.591 --> 07:41.401
Hey, guys, give me
a couple of seconds, okay?

07:41.461 --> 07:43.961
Five stores on the block have
been hit in the past two weeks.

07:44.030 --> 07:46.670
That Madison Street job, did
you find the murder weapon?

07:46.733 --> 07:49.743
Charter Arms Undercover.
Never found it. Why?

07:50.203 --> 07:53.553
It was used two nights ago.
Homicide on East 91st Street.

07:53.607 --> 07:56.817
This guy Rose,
he ever freelance his talents?

07:56.876 --> 08:00.256
Work for hire? Yeah, that's possible. He's
always looking for new opportunities.

08:00.313 --> 08:01.353
You've kept in touch?

08:01.414 --> 08:03.924
Hey, perpetrator walks, you know
sooner or later he's gonna slip.

08:03.984 --> 08:06.904
Rose swings a mop at the
Ogden Hotel, 9:00 to 5:00.

08:09.856 --> 08:11.956
What's this about?
I'm an honest working man.

08:12.025 --> 08:14.835
Yeah, we saw pictures of your work
at the Madison Street liquor store.

08:14.894 --> 08:17.774
It's very skillful how you put
three bullets in that guy's face.

08:17.831 --> 08:20.331
You can't touch me on that.
I'm innocent by the courts.

08:20.400 --> 08:21.710
You never hear
about double jeopardy?

08:21.768 --> 08:24.338
Hey, that only covers you for the
first guy you killed, Jimmy.

08:24.404 --> 08:27.154
The guy you shot Tuesday night's
a whole new ballgame, James.

08:27.207 --> 08:31.177
What guy? I was at a party with 50 people.
I didn't do no guy.

08:31.244 --> 08:33.024
That's funny, he was shot

08:33.078 --> 08:34.789
with the exact same gun
you used on the clerk.

08:34.847 --> 08:38.727
That's bull. I don't even got that gun anymore.
I mean, I never did...

08:38.784 --> 08:39.914
(GROANING)

08:40.486 --> 08:43.486
Listen, I am not messing around.
You keep jerking us around,

08:43.556 --> 08:46.366
I'm gonna stick my hand right
down your miserable throat,

08:46.426 --> 08:49.306
and turn your whole
miserable life around!

08:50.730 --> 08:55.110
CLERK: Hey! What are you doing? Hey,
this is official police business.

08:56.669 --> 09:00.809
When we get done with you, your
life is not gonna be worth living.

09:00.874 --> 09:05.124
Okay. There's nothing you can do to me,
anyway, on account of double jeopardy.

09:06.579 --> 09:10.759
The Madison Street thing,
after I ran from the store,

09:10.817 --> 09:14.417
I hopped on the Seven train at
the Brooklyn Bridge Station.

09:14.487 --> 09:18.367
I dropped the gun in the
subway, between the trains.

09:18.425 --> 09:21.625
Where on the subway? Between
Brooklyn Bridge and Essex.

09:21.695 --> 09:24.065
Thanks for the tip.
Cuff him, Mike.

09:24.164 --> 09:26.614
Hey, what are you doing?
Take that off.

09:26.666 --> 09:29.166
I told you, man, I'm covered
by double jeopardy here!

09:29.235 --> 09:30.805
Better go back
to law school, Jimmy.

09:30.870 --> 09:35.880
You disposed of a firearm used in a crime.
You're under arrest.

09:36.509 --> 09:40.459
LOGAN: We tossed Rose's crib. There is no gun.
BRISCOE: Yeah. And his alibi holds up.

09:40.747 --> 09:42.487
Assume he's telling the truth.

09:42.549 --> 09:45.759
His gun could've been picked up on
the tracks and sold on the street.

09:45.819 --> 09:47.959
Or used by whoever found it.

09:49.823 --> 09:53.243
You had a name you were working on?
Harrigan.

09:53.293 --> 09:55.473
He called Prescott
about some personal thing.

09:55.528 --> 09:56.558
LOGAN: Yeah. That's right.

09:56.629 --> 09:58.009
And Prescott canceled a meeting

09:58.064 --> 10:00.374
with the union over a personal thing.
So maybe...

10:00.433 --> 10:03.443
The reason he was killed
was a personal thing.

10:03.937 --> 10:05.577
Talk to the wife.

10:05.872 --> 10:08.082
Bill never talked about work.

10:08.141 --> 10:12.111
He just didn't bring his problems home.
That's the way we lived.

10:13.313 --> 10:15.883
Well, what did you talk about?

10:17.150 --> 10:19.490
I don't know.
We talked about...

10:21.087 --> 10:23.897
our children, our friends.

10:24.424 --> 10:27.034
So you and your husband
were getting along all right?

10:27.093 --> 10:29.103
Yes. Everything was fine.

10:30.196 --> 10:34.336
What are you insinuating? Nothing.
It's just a routine question.

10:35.168 --> 10:38.738
My daughter is afraid to leave this house.
I can't sleep anymore.

10:38.805 --> 10:41.475
And now you're implying my
husband was having an affair?

10:41.541 --> 10:44.751
LOGAN: There's a reason we
have to ask, Mrs. Prescott.

10:44.811 --> 10:47.991
We were told your husband canceled
a very important business meeting

10:48.047 --> 10:50.487
last week
for a personal matter.

10:50.550 --> 10:52.590
Do you know what that was?

10:53.753 --> 10:57.503
Bill is on the Board
of Directors

10:57.557 --> 11:01.597
of the Luther C. Chase
Academy, our son's school.

11:02.896 --> 11:04.666
They had some kind of
a last-minute meeting.

11:04.731 --> 11:06.071
I don't know what it was about.

11:06.132 --> 11:08.872
Did your husband ever mention
a man named Harrigan?

11:08.935 --> 11:10.205
Harrigan?

11:11.271 --> 11:15.011
Yes, I know that name. It's
one of our son's schoolmates.

11:18.478 --> 11:19.548
(BELL RINGING)

11:19.612 --> 11:21.252
Here.

11:21.314 --> 11:24.524
I'm sorry, I can't release
the Harrigan's address.

11:24.584 --> 11:26.194
You'll have to see
the headmaster.

11:26.252 --> 11:27.662
Fine.
We'll see the headmaster.

11:27.720 --> 11:29.760
Do you want to
make the introductions?

11:29.823 --> 11:32.433
Oh, Dr. Penton's not on the
premises at the moment.

11:32.492 --> 11:34.562
If you leave your name
and phone number...

11:34.627 --> 11:38.577
Miss, we're not asking for the
answers to next week's algebra exam.

11:38.631 --> 11:42.581
LCC protects the privacy of its
students and their parents.

11:42.635 --> 11:45.665
It has done so for 130 years.

11:45.738 --> 11:48.578
It's not up to me
to change school policy.

11:48.641 --> 11:51.951
Well, our organization goes
back even farther than that.

11:52.011 --> 11:55.321
And our policy includes such
things as search warrants.

11:55.381 --> 11:58.291
Now, if you like,
we can come back with one.

11:58.851 --> 12:00.351
Just a moment.

12:10.196 --> 12:14.466
Mr. Harrigan's home address. I
doubt you'll find him there now.

12:14.534 --> 12:16.914
You might try the New
York Transit Authority.

12:16.970 --> 12:19.450
Oh, yeah? What is he,
the commissioner?

12:19.505 --> 12:23.915
Oh, hardly. He works in the
subway, down on the tracks.

12:27.113 --> 12:29.353
Tom Harrigan's a track walker.

12:29.883 --> 12:32.093
He inspects three to four
miles of track every day,

12:32.151 --> 12:36.931
looking for loose bolts, track sleepers,
anything that falls off a train.

12:36.990 --> 12:39.160
You can't imagine
what they find down there.

12:39.225 --> 12:42.395
I bet we can.
Where's Harrigan now?

12:45.565 --> 12:47.265
He's here.

12:47.333 --> 12:51.613
He walks this whole length, between
here and here, every two days.

12:51.671 --> 12:55.851
I hate to ask you this, but can you
tell us where was he walking last May?

12:56.976 --> 12:58.746
Last May.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.000
The J line.

13:14.827 --> 13:17.537
Two blocks
from Madison Street Liquors.

13:25.271 --> 13:28.011
We find a gun.
We're supposed to turn it in.

13:28.074 --> 13:31.114
Well, we're looking for a pistol that
was dropped on the I line last May.

13:31.177 --> 13:32.747
And you were working there,
right?

13:32.812 --> 13:34.262
Yeah.
I didn't find no pistol.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.824
There's a lot of homeless down there.
Maybe one of them did. Is it important?

13:37.884 --> 13:39.424
We think it is.

13:39.485 --> 13:42.485
That's the gun that shot
William Prescott last Tuesday.

13:42.555 --> 13:46.555
Yeah. I read that he got shot. That's terrible.
People aren't safe anymore.

13:46.626 --> 13:48.606
Yeah. You're right.

13:48.661 --> 13:52.401
By the way, what were you doing last Tuesday
night, if you don't mind my asking?

13:52.465 --> 13:55.965
Me? I was home with my kid,
watching the Knicks.

13:56.836 --> 13:58.176
What's this got to do with me?

13:58.237 --> 14:00.617
You were calling Prescott
every couple of days.

14:00.673 --> 14:03.093
And you two don't exactly
look like drinking buddies.

14:03.142 --> 14:06.682
It was about my kid, Colin.
He got kicked out of school.

14:07.280 --> 14:08.280
Prescott's got some pull,

14:08.347 --> 14:10.327
I figured maybe he could
help me get Colin back in.

14:10.383 --> 14:12.733
He have anything to do
with getting him kicked out?

14:12.785 --> 14:16.455
Look, that's between me, my kid
and the school, all right?

14:16.522 --> 14:19.632
That's the way they want it.
They? Meaning the school?

14:19.692 --> 14:22.102
Yeah. That's the way
they do things.

14:22.161 --> 14:24.641
I worked hard to get Colin
into Luther Chase.

14:24.697 --> 14:26.507
If he's got a prayer
of getting back in,

14:26.566 --> 14:29.266
I don't wanna blow it
by talking out of turn.

14:29.335 --> 14:33.505
I gotta get back to work.
Am I arrested? Not yet.

14:38.745 --> 14:40.215
(BELL RINGING)

14:41.147 --> 14:43.417
We were terribly shocked
by Bill's death.

14:43.483 --> 14:46.693
He was an outstanding parent and a
great contribution to the school.

14:46.753 --> 14:51.263
How much of a contribution did he make
in getting Colin Harrigan expelled?

14:51.324 --> 14:52.674
What do you mean?

14:52.725 --> 14:55.135
Well, Colin's father
called Prescott several times.

14:55.194 --> 14:57.734
We'd like to find out
what was going on.

14:57.797 --> 14:59.567
Well, Bill was
on the Board of Governors.

14:59.632 --> 15:02.582
As such, he had some input in
the decision to expel Colin.

15:02.635 --> 15:06.775
A guy like Tom Harrigan must've saved
every penny to pay the tuition here.

15:06.839 --> 15:09.339
He had to be a little upset
when you gave his son the boot.

15:09.409 --> 15:11.449
Colin was on
a partial scholarship.

15:11.511 --> 15:15.861
But, yes, Mr. Harrigan had a difficult
time accepting the Board's decision.

15:15.915 --> 15:18.115
But I can't imagine
he'd turn violent.

15:18.184 --> 15:21.434
What exactly did Colin do
to get himself kicked out?

15:21.487 --> 15:22.687
Well, outside of being

15:22.755 --> 15:26.125
an outstanding hockey player
and a diligent student,

15:26.492 --> 15:29.342
Colin simply didn't fit into
the LCC family.

15:29.395 --> 15:31.765
Beyond that,
I can't discuss specifics.

15:31.831 --> 15:35.141
Well, we'd like
to discuss the specifics.

15:36.969 --> 15:40.849
Minor children are involved, Detective.
Their parents could sue us.

15:40.907 --> 15:42.507
Until I talk to legal counsel,

15:42.575 --> 15:47.015
I'm afraid I can't discuss any more
of your questions. Forgive me.

15:48.314 --> 15:51.304
Even if we tie Harrigan to the
gun, I don't see a motive here.

15:51.350 --> 15:54.130
Look, getting his kid into that
prep school was a big deal.

15:54.187 --> 15:56.497
And having him thrown out's
a bigger deal.

15:56.556 --> 15:58.466
Why focus his anger
on Prescott?

15:58.524 --> 16:00.874
Maybe he was working his way
through the Board of Governors.

16:00.927 --> 16:02.997
We don't know.
The school isn't saying.

16:03.062 --> 16:06.072
I mean, they've got a 130-year-old
tradition of clamming up.

16:06.132 --> 16:08.482
They must keep files. You tried
getting a search warrant?

16:08.534 --> 16:11.884
Judge Moser turned them down. The
application was too general.

16:11.938 --> 16:14.108
I'll talk to McCoy
about convening a grand jury.

16:14.173 --> 16:17.153
Then we can issue a subpoena duces
tecum for the school files.

16:17.210 --> 16:19.450
You'll have it by tomorrow.
VAN BUREN: Thanks, Claire.

16:19.512 --> 16:22.322
In the meantime,
check Harrigan's alibi.

16:26.519 --> 16:31.059
I was out shopping with my sister,
but Tom was home here with Colin.

16:31.123 --> 16:35.073
How can you be so sure? 'Cause
I called home just about 8:00.

16:35.127 --> 16:38.897
Colin had been out skating at Wolman. I
told Tom to heat up some soup for him.

16:38.965 --> 16:41.205
Look, you got the wrong idea
about my husband.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.107
Oh, he wasn't upset
about your son?

16:43.169 --> 16:45.209
Of course he was.
He had it all planned.

16:45.271 --> 16:49.551
The right prep school, hockey
scholarship to Dartmouth or Cornell.

16:49.609 --> 16:53.079
Look, he was doing everything he could
to work things out with the LCC.

16:53.145 --> 16:55.625
Did he ever say anything about
talking to William Prescott?

16:55.681 --> 16:58.991
No. He just said that he was
talking to all the right people.

16:59.051 --> 17:02.691
Did Prescott have a lot to do
with Colin getting expelled?

17:03.256 --> 17:04.556
I don't know.

17:04.624 --> 17:06.834
Well, maybe if you told us
what it was your son did.

17:06.893 --> 17:10.713
Look, it doesn't matter what he did.
They didn't want him around.

17:10.762 --> 17:13.713
He was a better athlete than
their kids, and he was smarter.

17:13.766 --> 17:15.965
They were just looking for
an excuse to get rid of him.

17:16.035 --> 17:17.905
Oh, what excuse
did they come up with?

17:17.970 --> 17:20.609
Look, I don't have to
tell you anything.

17:20.673 --> 17:23.022
I guess it's not just the rich
who look down on us.

17:23.075 --> 17:26.885
One of them gets killed, it's
gotta be the dirty mick, right?

17:28.481 --> 17:31.861
The way these people keep secrets, they
ought to be giving lessons to the CIA.

17:31.918 --> 17:34.988
I mean, what did the kid do, stage
a circle jerk in the locker room?

17:35.054 --> 17:37.804
Worse. He probably brought some
of Mom's corned beef and cabbage

17:37.857 --> 17:39.727
to the school tea party.

17:39.792 --> 17:42.972
Well, they live 15 minutes
from the Prescott's.

17:43.029 --> 17:45.409
They might as well
be on a different planet.

17:45.464 --> 17:47.034
What? Yeah.

17:47.967 --> 17:49.807
Yeah, tell them we'll be there.

17:49.869 --> 17:53.579
Speaking of different planets,
we're going back to LCC.

17:53.840 --> 17:57.550
Dr. Penton informed me of the subpoena.
As legal counsel to the school,

17:57.610 --> 18:01.150
and as the parent of a
student, I was very concerned.

18:01.214 --> 18:03.724
Oh, we're very concerned,
too, Mr. Barclay.

18:03.783 --> 18:06.493
I spoke to a Mr. McCoy at the
District Attorney's office,

18:06.552 --> 18:10.472
and I assured him that we would
give you any information you want.

18:10.523 --> 18:13.403
But because of the privacy
issue, you understand,

18:13.459 --> 18:16.529
we can't just
hand over the school's files.

18:16.596 --> 18:20.006
Well, you do understand, we expect
you to be completely candid.

18:20.066 --> 18:21.836
Goes without saying.

18:21.901 --> 18:23.281
Dr. Penton?

18:24.070 --> 18:26.450
Colin had a terrible temper.

18:26.505 --> 18:29.575
He fought with other students. He
talked back to the instructors...

18:29.642 --> 18:32.492
So did I.
Never got me expelled.

18:34.413 --> 18:37.833
Three weeks ago, he brought
a firearm to school.

18:37.884 --> 18:41.964
Apparently, it belonged to his father.
LOGAN: What kind of firearm?

18:42.021 --> 18:46.331
Well, we never actually saw it, but
it was described as a small pistol.

18:46.392 --> 18:47.702
Did anybody see it?

18:47.760 --> 18:50.240
The student Colin threatened
with the gun,

18:50.296 --> 18:52.996
Vaughn Prescott, Bill's son.

18:54.133 --> 18:55.173
Bill was incensed.

18:55.234 --> 18:58.584
He asked me, in my capacity as
Chairman of the Board of Governors,

18:58.638 --> 19:02.448
to do whatever it took to have
Colin removed from the school.

19:03.709 --> 19:05.249
I had to agree.

19:06.379 --> 19:10.759
How many Park Avenue homes have
you torn apart over this thing?

19:10.816 --> 19:14.556
We couldn't get a search warrant
for those, Mrs. Harrigan.

19:17.056 --> 19:19.396
Whose coat is this?
It belongs to my son.

19:19.458 --> 19:21.368
The kid's room's clean.
The parents' room's clean,

19:21.427 --> 19:22.997
and there's nothing
in the kitchen.

19:23.062 --> 19:24.302
The kid's gloves.

19:24.363 --> 19:28.283
It was cold as hell the night of
the shooting, let's keep them.

19:29.101 --> 19:32.951
Hey, what's going on here? We
have a warrant, Mr. Harrigan.

19:33.005 --> 19:35.035
Warrant or no, I want you
the hell out of here!

19:35.107 --> 19:38.047
Yeah. We were just leaving. We'd
like to take your son along with us.

19:38.110 --> 19:42.460
We want to talk to him. You want
to talk to Colin? I go with him.

19:43.649 --> 19:45.959
Look. I don't know what the
hell gun you're talking about.

19:46.018 --> 19:48.618
I'm talking about the piece
you flashed around.

19:48.688 --> 19:50.528
The one that got you
into all the trouble.

19:50.589 --> 19:52.359
I didn't bring
any gun to school.

19:52.425 --> 19:55.125
What'd you do? Threaten the
Prescott kid with your finger?

19:55.194 --> 19:56.644
Look, the school
wanted me out of there,

19:56.696 --> 19:59.576
so they made up that crap
about the gun, all right?

20:00.099 --> 20:04.099
I know where you're coming from,
Colin, a lot more than you think.

20:04.170 --> 20:06.740
Bunch of country club kids
dissed you, right?

20:06.806 --> 20:09.616
Made you feel like you were
trespassing on their turf.

20:09.675 --> 20:12.655
So you go to visit Prescott,
get a little respect.

20:12.712 --> 20:15.422
But then things
get out of hand, right?

20:15.581 --> 20:17.821
I was home, all night.

20:18.751 --> 20:22.531
Your mother said you went skating.
That was before, around 7:00.

20:22.588 --> 20:24.088
I got home in time
for the Knicks game.

20:24.156 --> 20:27.796
Anybody see you at the rink? I don't know.
I didn't look, all right?

20:27.860 --> 20:31.870
That's enough. He's just a kid.
He needs to go home now.

20:33.265 --> 20:35.935
Yeah, right. Just a kid.

20:36.602 --> 20:38.812
A kid with an attitude
and a half.

20:38.871 --> 20:40.411
Grow up on the Upper East Side,

20:40.473 --> 20:42.893
you get a Tiffany spoon
in your mouth.

20:42.975 --> 20:44.545
Grow up in Inwood,
you get that.

20:44.610 --> 20:48.620
Kid with a short fuse and a gun.
Bad luck for Mr. Prescott.

20:48.981 --> 20:52.051
Maybe bad luck for us.
No gun, no eyewitness.

20:52.118 --> 20:53.648
And his parents say
he was home.

20:53.719 --> 20:56.789
Right. And they've got to be
telling the truth.

20:56.856 --> 20:58.226
(PHONE RINGING)

20:58.324 --> 20:59.434
Yeah.

21:01.827 --> 21:03.067
Thanks.

21:04.397 --> 21:08.137
Forensics found gunpowder residue
on the kid's right glove.

21:11.737 --> 21:15.447
Colin Harrigan, you're under arrest
for the murder of William Prescott.

21:15.508 --> 21:16.538
What?

21:16.609 --> 21:17.989
You have the right
to remain silent.

21:18.044 --> 21:19.084
Anything you do say

21:19.145 --> 21:21.815
can and will be used against
you in a court of law.

21:23.949 --> 21:27.159
I doubt Mr. McCoy's stormtroopers even
bothered to read the search warrant.

21:27.219 --> 21:29.289
It specified a gun,
not a pair of gloves.

21:29.355 --> 21:32.295
Mr. Dwyer should keep up
with his own reading.

21:32.358 --> 21:34.698
The courts allow the seizure
of any relevant evidence.

21:34.760 --> 21:37.570
In what universe?
People v. Baker, Your Honor.

21:37.630 --> 21:38.970
The police
were looking for a knife.

21:39.031 --> 21:41.711
They took a blood-stained sweater instead.
The court suppressed it.

21:41.767 --> 21:44.437
And 16 years later,
under People v. Watson,

21:44.503 --> 21:46.353
that same sweater
would've been allowed.

21:46.405 --> 21:50.005
Watson covers obviously incriminating
evidence found in plain view.

21:50.076 --> 21:52.716
The gloves were neither. JACK:
In his opinion, Your Honor.

21:52.778 --> 21:54.918
Your Honor, what makes this
search especially odious

21:54.980 --> 21:57.620
is the fact the warrant was
predicated on false information.

21:57.683 --> 22:02.133
Weren't the officers told your client
threatened a schoolmate with a gun?

22:02.188 --> 22:03.428
It was a lie.

22:03.489 --> 22:06.939
The officers had a subpoena duces
tecum to search the school files.

22:06.992 --> 22:09.632
If they'd gotten off their duffs
and actually looked at the files,

22:09.695 --> 22:12.535
they would've found
a copy of this letter.

22:12.765 --> 22:15.635
It was sent three weeks ago by the
headmaster to Colin's father.

22:15.701 --> 22:17.841
It states that it was
an unnamed student,

22:17.970 --> 22:19.970
and not my client,
who had the gun.

22:20.039 --> 22:21.709
Well, we're splitting
hairs here, Your Honor.

22:21.774 --> 22:25.814
According to this, the student said
he got the gun from Colin Harrigan.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.218
What matters is what the
headmaster told the police.

22:28.280 --> 22:31.320
They had no reason to doubt his word.
They acted in good faith.

22:31.383 --> 22:34.923
Mr. McCoy, my cat coughs up
sweeter smelling goop

22:34.987 --> 22:36.687
than this search warrant.

22:37.823 --> 22:41.793
Motion to suppress granted. They
have no other evidence, Your Honor.

22:43.295 --> 22:46.995
You're two for two, Mr. Dwyer.
Motion to dismiss granted.

22:47.967 --> 22:51.137
I had no idea
Vaughn had been threatened.

22:51.904 --> 22:54.544
My husband never said
a word about it.

22:54.607 --> 22:56.777
Dad didn't want you to worry.

22:59.145 --> 23:01.385
Why didn't you tell the police?

23:01.447 --> 23:03.827
I was afraid.
CLAIRE: Afraid of who?

23:04.950 --> 23:08.160
Isn't that obvious?
He's afraid of Colin Harrigan.

23:08.654 --> 23:11.164
We know that Colin didn't
threaten you with a gun.

23:11.223 --> 23:13.003
It was another boy.

23:13.759 --> 23:15.709
We wanna know his name.

23:17.696 --> 23:20.536
Dr. Penton told me not to
discuss it with anybody.

23:20.599 --> 23:22.039
Especially outsiders.

23:22.101 --> 23:25.311
Vaughn, tell Mr. McCoy
who it was.

23:30.509 --> 23:33.419
It was Barclay.
Stewart Barclay.

23:35.447 --> 23:37.317
Nathan Barclay's boy?

23:38.150 --> 23:39.150
Oh, my God.

23:39.218 --> 23:41.888
He roughed me up
a couple of times.

23:41.954 --> 23:44.304
I told our third-form master.

23:44.657 --> 23:47.257
And after that, Stewart
threatened you with the gun?

23:47.326 --> 23:50.166
Yeah. I was afraid
to go back to school.

23:50.563 --> 23:54.913
He and Harrigan have this gang, five
or six boys, from the hockey team.

23:55.201 --> 23:56.611
We call them wannabes.

23:56.669 --> 24:00.339
They want to be like Colin,
because he walks the walk.

24:00.406 --> 24:03.876
They think he's so cool,
especially Stewart.

24:04.510 --> 24:07.490
Stewart will do anything
to impress Harrigan.

24:08.647 --> 24:10.517
NATHAN:
It was Harrigan's gun.

24:11.150 --> 24:13.890
The fact that it passed through
my son's hands is irrelevant.

24:13.953 --> 24:17.733
He was the last person seen in possession
of a murder weapon, Mr. Barclay.

24:17.790 --> 24:19.930
That strikes me as relevant.

24:22.728 --> 24:25.328
When you were finished waving
it in Vaughn Prescott's face,

24:25.397 --> 24:26.837
what did you do with it?

24:26.899 --> 24:28.939
Colin ditched it.
Where?

24:29.535 --> 24:31.135
I don't know.
He didn't tell me.

24:31.203 --> 24:33.113
After he was expelled,

24:33.172 --> 24:36.952
did you have any conversation with him
about Vaughn Prescott or his father?

24:37.009 --> 24:39.849
No. I'm not allowed
to talk to him at all.

24:41.313 --> 24:44.093
Stewart, once you leave here, if
I find out you've lied to me...

24:44.149 --> 24:45.559
Don't you threaten my son.

24:45.617 --> 24:50.587
No one, and that includes your father and
your school, will be able to protect you.

24:51.223 --> 24:53.133
Do you understand that?

24:57.963 --> 25:01.743
Come on, Stewart. Mr. McCoy
is finished with you.

25:03.335 --> 25:05.405
CLAIRE: Stewart Barclay's
not just any other student.

25:05.471 --> 25:07.971
His father's the Chairman of the
school's Board of Governors.

25:08.040 --> 25:11.320
Not coincidentally,
he's also their legal advisor.

25:11.377 --> 25:14.317
When we served the school
with the subpoena,

25:14.380 --> 25:17.190
he's the one who assured us
of their full cooperation.

25:17.249 --> 25:20.629
Instead, the school circled the limos
to keep the Barclay name out of it.

25:20.686 --> 25:21.756
I'm shocked.

25:21.820 --> 25:24.530
This isn't stink bombs
in the boys' room, Adam.

25:24.590 --> 25:27.370
They hindered prosecution
of an A felony.

25:27.426 --> 25:28.666
Now I'm very shocked.

25:28.727 --> 25:30.897
It doesn't bother you they
might be protecting a felon?

25:30.963 --> 25:34.413
Do you have evidence that
the Barclay kid's involved?

25:35.267 --> 25:36.867
Didn't think so.

25:37.736 --> 25:39.936
Harrigan's your shooter.

25:40.005 --> 25:44.145
Don't invent conspiracies just because
these people rub you the wrong way.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.709
If we dig into this
Harrigan-Barclay relationship,

25:46.779 --> 25:49.119
maybe we'll find
the smoking gun.

25:50.082 --> 25:52.392
There was no deliberate
deception, Mr. McCoy.

25:52.451 --> 25:55.061
No one placed themselves
above the law.

25:55.120 --> 25:57.830
What do you call
lying to the police?

25:57.890 --> 26:00.840
But surely you don't suspect
Stewart Barclay of murder.

26:00.893 --> 26:04.103
LCC has molded four
generations of Barclay boys.

26:04.463 --> 26:06.473
Our students don't grow up
to be criminals.

26:06.532 --> 26:10.242
Carrying a concealed weapon,
menacing, assault.

26:10.669 --> 26:13.739
Some of your students
already are criminals.

26:13.806 --> 26:16.836
Harrigan was a negative
influence on the student body,

26:16.909 --> 26:19.149
and on Stewart in particular.

26:19.211 --> 26:22.091
We thought expelling him
would solve the problem.

26:22.147 --> 26:24.587
It didn't? Some parents
received phone calls,

26:24.650 --> 26:26.790
threatening their sons
if he wasn't readmitted.

26:26.852 --> 26:30.132
And it didn't occur to you
to report those phone calls?

26:30.189 --> 26:34.299
I honestly believed we could take
care of it within the LCC family.

26:34.360 --> 26:36.170
Who made these calls?

26:41.066 --> 26:44.476
Well, we weren't able
to nail it down,

26:44.536 --> 26:48.506
but someone thought they recognized
Stewart Barclay's voice.

26:48.574 --> 26:53.524
It sounds like you expelled the wrong boy.
I take exception to that.

26:53.579 --> 26:56.619
Harrigan's a social
experiment that failed.

26:56.849 --> 26:59.849
His gutter values contaminated
the other students.

26:59.918 --> 27:01.228
We had to weed him out.

27:01.286 --> 27:05.526
You hear that, Claire? We've stumbled
on a nest of Social Darwinists.

27:06.859 --> 27:08.999
Is this what you teach them
in Civics class?

27:09.061 --> 27:13.241
It may not be fashionable,
Mr. McCoy, but it is tried and true.

27:13.298 --> 27:17.008
I want the names of the people
who got called, all of them.

27:21.373 --> 27:24.293
I spoke with five parents
who got phone calls.

27:24.343 --> 27:26.723
One of them had their son
listen in on an extension.

27:26.779 --> 27:29.619
He recognized
Stewart Barclay's voice.

27:29.681 --> 27:31.351
He's sure it was him?
Yes.

27:31.416 --> 27:34.686
According to the police report,
two days before he was shot,

27:34.753 --> 27:38.633
Prescott got a threatening phone
call at work from a young boy.

27:38.690 --> 27:42.540
I wonder what else Stewart was doing to
prove what a tough little homeboy he is.

27:42.594 --> 27:46.014
Well, helping his buddy shoot
someone would certainly qualify.

27:46.565 --> 27:50.335
Mrs. Harrigan said her son was
skating at Wolman that night.

27:50.402 --> 27:52.812
Find out
if he was skating pairs.

27:55.974 --> 27:58.554
Most people, they skate the circle.
Kids like these,

27:58.610 --> 28:00.850
they cut ice like they're on
a breakaway with Messier.

28:01.446 --> 28:04.546
Well, I want to know
about these kids, Mr. Sosa.

28:06.285 --> 28:08.485
Yeah. Yeah, I remember them.

28:08.954 --> 28:12.204
They accidentally clipped one of
our young citizens from uptown.

28:12.257 --> 28:14.827
I figured him and his three whaddups
were gonna cream these two.

28:14.893 --> 28:16.603
But the black kids
just took off.

28:16.662 --> 28:19.402
Maybe they had homework to do.
Right.

28:19.598 --> 28:20.698
I figured they were coming back

28:20.766 --> 28:21.796
with about 10 of their buddies.

28:21.867 --> 28:24.347
So I told these two
to get lost.

28:24.403 --> 28:28.013
This one here starts mouthing off at me.
Up mine, up my mother's.

28:28.073 --> 28:31.653
Nothing you haven't heard before.
Except for emphasis.

28:31.710 --> 28:33.690
This little butt-wipe,
he lifts up his jersey.

28:33.745 --> 28:36.445
He's got this gun sticking out
of his hockey pants.

28:36.515 --> 28:37.885
That's what scared
the black kids.

28:37.950 --> 28:39.690
What time was this?

28:40.752 --> 28:42.662
Around 7:30. Gotta go.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.461
BOY: Let go, man! Let go!

28:44.523 --> 28:47.533
They're all full of it.
I didn't call anybody.

28:47.593 --> 28:49.103
You know what?

28:49.962 --> 28:52.272
We can pull your phone records.

28:52.765 --> 28:54.745
We can prove
you made those calls, Stewart.

28:54.800 --> 28:57.140
Even if he did make a few
crank calls, it hardly...

28:57.202 --> 28:59.342
Crank calls?
He made threats, Mr. Barclay.

28:59.404 --> 29:03.014
According to you. But I guarantee it
was Harrigan who put him up to it.

29:03.075 --> 29:04.645
He and his father,
they're all alike.

29:04.710 --> 29:06.420
With their Irish temper,
they lose control,

29:06.478 --> 29:07.978
and the next thing you know,
we have a murder...

29:08.046 --> 29:11.616
So Harrigan did it because he's a mick?
Detective Logan is a mick.

29:11.683 --> 29:13.163
I'm a mick, sir.

29:13.218 --> 29:17.598
And if you don't shut up, I'll lose
control and throw you out of the room!

29:19.057 --> 29:23.057
Take that cap off. Your tough-guy
act is not going to save you.

29:23.128 --> 29:25.838
Our witness puts you in the
park with Colin and the gun

29:25.897 --> 29:28.377
a half an hour
before Mr. Prescott was shot.

29:28.433 --> 29:31.113
We didn't have a gun. I swear.

29:31.169 --> 29:33.509
LOGAN: Where did you go
after you left Wolman rink?

29:33.572 --> 29:37.112
We went home. Where
exactly did you walk to?

29:38.210 --> 29:41.920
I walked Colin to Columbus
Circle, then he took a subway.

29:43.181 --> 29:45.561
The skate geek is lying.
I didn't have any gun.

29:45.784 --> 29:49.164
And what about those black kids? You
just said, "Boo," and they took off?

29:49.221 --> 29:50.431
I just lifted my jersey

29:50.489 --> 29:53.699
and showed them the corner of my hip
pad, you know, on my hockey pants.

29:53.759 --> 29:54.829
It looks like a gun butt.

29:54.893 --> 29:58.033
That's what they saw, and
that's what the other guy saw.

29:58.630 --> 30:01.740
Tell me exactly how you
went home from the rink.

30:03.068 --> 30:06.348
We walked over to Columbus Circle and
then I hopped the A train to Dyckman.

30:06.405 --> 30:08.845
That's it?
You went straight home?

30:09.908 --> 30:11.748
Well, you had your chance.

30:11.810 --> 30:16.050
I just finished talking to Stewart Barclay.
He has a different story.

30:16.114 --> 30:19.824
He doesn't skip the part about
going to the Prescott house.

30:22.287 --> 30:25.127
What specifically did he tell you?
Everything I need to know.

30:25.190 --> 30:27.970
Stew wouldn't tell you squat.
We didn't do anything.

30:28.026 --> 30:30.696
His statement's being
typed up as we speak.

30:30.762 --> 30:33.242
After he signs it, you can
read it on your way to Rikers.

30:33.298 --> 30:34.828
TOM: Wait a minute.

30:35.968 --> 30:38.778
We wanna talk to our lawyer
in private.

30:45.611 --> 30:48.791
You got a confession from Barclay?
JACK: Did I say that?

30:48.847 --> 30:50.487
You certainly implied it.

30:50.549 --> 30:52.719
There's no law
against lying to a suspect.

30:52.784 --> 30:55.534
And you probably miss the
good old days before Miranda.

30:55.587 --> 30:57.397
Hey, if anybody
wants to hear some of this,

30:57.456 --> 30:59.596
I could accidentally
hit the intercom button.

30:59.658 --> 31:02.138
That's what my old man
would've done

31:02.194 --> 31:04.944
in the good old days
before Miranda.

31:05.364 --> 31:06.904
(KNOCKING ON DOOR)

31:12.838 --> 31:16.378
Mr. Harrigan wants to make a statement.
He's aware of his rights.

31:16.441 --> 31:19.511
I've advised him against it,
but this is what he wants.

31:21.446 --> 31:24.086
I did it. I shot Prescott.

31:24.149 --> 31:25.749
Mr. Harrigan,
I know what you're trying...

31:25.817 --> 31:28.127
I don't care
what Stewart Barclay said.

31:28.186 --> 31:31.626
I shot Prescott. He ruined
everything I worked for.

31:31.690 --> 31:35.260
That's all fine, except for the
gunpowder on your son's gloves.

31:35.327 --> 31:38.497
Those are my gloves.
Colin wears them sometimes.

31:39.898 --> 31:42.608
Prescott's secretary told me
what time he gets home.

31:42.667 --> 31:45.237
I wanted to talk to him
about Colin.

31:46.038 --> 31:47.808
He didn't give a crap.

31:47.873 --> 31:50.323
He said
Colin had his one chance.

31:50.375 --> 31:53.475
He said that's the only chance
people like us deserve.

31:54.980 --> 31:56.390
I shot him.

31:57.649 --> 32:00.959
You don't believe me?
I'll take you to the gun.

32:17.135 --> 32:18.875
MAN: Yeah. It's over here.

32:22.941 --> 32:25.081
I put it in there, in a bag.

32:35.520 --> 32:38.330
.32 Charter Arms Undercover.
That's it.

32:40.592 --> 32:42.372
Read him his rights.

32:42.728 --> 32:46.768
Thomas Harrigan, you're under arrest
for the murder of William Prescott.

32:46.832 --> 32:48.712
You have the right
to remain silent.

32:48.767 --> 32:51.507
Anything you say can and
will be used against...

32:54.439 --> 32:58.409
Harrigan pled guilty at his
arraignment and waived indictment.

32:58.477 --> 33:00.457
It's all over
except for the cheering.

33:00.512 --> 33:03.292
Look, I don't believe it. The
man's dedicated to his son.

33:03.348 --> 33:04.948
He has every reason
to take the rap.

33:05.016 --> 33:08.826
And every reason to shoot the man he
blames for ruining his son's future.

33:08.887 --> 33:11.087
ADAM: Police find
a fingerprint on the gun?

33:11.156 --> 33:13.896
A partial of Harrigan's
thumb-print on the pistol butt.

33:13.959 --> 33:14.989
You're ignoring the possibility

33:15.060 --> 33:17.100
that he just helped his son
get rid of the weapon.

33:17.162 --> 33:20.232
Yes, I am, Claire,
because I'm not his attorney.

33:21.266 --> 33:24.706
We say he's guilty. He says he's guilty.
He's guilty.

33:24.769 --> 33:27.549
How contrite was he
at the plea negotiation?

33:27.606 --> 33:30.776
Enough to get his sentence
reduced to 15-to-life.

33:31.109 --> 33:32.379
The allocution's tomorrow.

33:32.444 --> 33:34.864
Be happy, Miss Kincaid,

33:34.913 --> 33:38.423
we're saving the taxpayers
a quarter of a million bucks.

33:43.188 --> 33:46.598
I waited for Mr. Prescott across
the street from his house.

33:46.658 --> 33:49.368
I wanted to talk to him
about my son.

33:49.427 --> 33:52.697
I had a gun with me that I
carry for my protection.

33:53.098 --> 33:57.978
Mr. Prescott drove up in a town car.
I waited for the car to drive away.

33:58.036 --> 34:00.916
Then I crossed the street
to talk to him.

34:00.972 --> 34:02.542
We had an argument.

34:02.607 --> 34:05.917
He insulted me.
He insulted my family.

34:05.977 --> 34:09.147
He turned his back on me
like I was a panhandler.

34:09.947 --> 34:14.588
At that moment, I got angry.
I shot him twice in the back.

34:14.652 --> 34:16.433
And then I ran away.

34:17.755 --> 34:20.356
JUDGE BARRY: Is that
satisfactory to the People?

34:22.627 --> 34:24.766
Just one moment, Your Honor.

34:28.099 --> 34:29.768
What's going on?

34:33.905 --> 34:37.844
Your Honor, we find
the allocution unsatisfactory.

34:37.909 --> 34:41.018
My client just described, in
detail, how he shot the victim.

34:41.079 --> 34:42.579
What else does Mr. McCoy want?

34:42.647 --> 34:45.487
Mr. McCoy, do you wish to inquire?
Not at this moment, Your Honor.

34:45.550 --> 34:46.719
We move for a continuance.

34:46.784 --> 34:49.525
Your Honor, we have a deal in place.
We agreed to 15 years.

34:49.588 --> 34:51.328
If Mr. McCoy is just trying
to up the ante...

34:51.389 --> 34:54.728
I'm not, Your Honor.
I simply request 24 hours.

34:54.793 --> 34:56.743
But if the defense
can't consent to this,

34:56.795 --> 34:59.365
I will withdraw
the sentence agreement.

34:59.898 --> 35:02.878
All right, Your Honor,
then I withdraw my objection.

35:02.934 --> 35:05.684
Court will reconvene
at 9:00 a.m. tomorrow.

35:06.004 --> 35:09.014
He said he waited for
Prescott's car to drive away.

35:09.074 --> 35:10.784
Prescott's driver
told the police

35:10.842 --> 35:13.882
he dropped him at the corner,
more than half a block away.

35:13.945 --> 35:17.975
Harrigan couldn't have seen the car.
You were right. He didn't do it.

35:18.049 --> 35:19.489
I would've rather been wrong.

35:19.551 --> 35:22.731
Our case against the boys
is still at square one.

35:23.088 --> 35:25.498
They had a little gang
at school?

35:25.557 --> 35:28.627
Get their names and bring
'em in for show-and-tell.

35:45.610 --> 35:47.590
I'm Jack McCoy.

35:48.046 --> 35:51.256
I'm the Assistant District
Attorney for New York County.

35:52.551 --> 35:57.001
You were invited here to talk to me
about the murder of William Prescott.

35:58.857 --> 36:02.427
And make no mistake,
you will talk to me.

36:05.664 --> 36:07.514
You're going to tell me
everything you know

36:07.565 --> 36:11.565
about Colin Harrigan and Stewart
Barclay's roles in that killing.

36:13.271 --> 36:14.811
If you don't,

36:15.840 --> 36:17.320
if you lie,

36:18.810 --> 36:21.550
I'll add a new word
to your vocabulary.

36:22.080 --> 36:25.320
Conspiracy to commit murder.

36:27.185 --> 36:32.125
You could serve as many years in prison as
you have candles on your birthday cake.

36:33.592 --> 36:35.592
Who wants to speak first?

36:43.635 --> 36:46.235
Detective Morel.
Start with this one.

36:57.616 --> 37:01.356
The longer this takes, the harder
these gentlemen will push.

37:02.020 --> 37:05.400
They don't scare me.
They can't lay a hand on us.

37:05.457 --> 37:08.437
I don't see anybody
around here to stop them.

37:09.294 --> 37:12.544
This isn't a rock-music video,
son. This is reality.

37:12.597 --> 37:15.737
A man is dead, and our
patience is wearing thin.

37:15.800 --> 37:19.370
Detective Logan? Let's you
and me have a conversation.

37:26.177 --> 37:29.387
I give your friend 15 minutes
with Detective Logan.

37:29.848 --> 37:33.298
He will not only implicate
Harrigan and Barclay,

37:33.852 --> 37:36.862
he might even point the finger
at some of you.

37:39.758 --> 37:43.498
There's... You have
something to say to me?

37:46.564 --> 37:47.804
Kelly.

37:52.370 --> 37:54.210
Andrew Jameson.

37:56.040 --> 37:58.580
What do you want to tell me,
Andrew?

38:02.580 --> 38:04.620
It was all Stewart's idea.

38:05.116 --> 38:07.426
He told Colin to bring a gun.

38:10.021 --> 38:14.991
Three of us were gonna wear ski masks and
scare the hell out of Prescott's old man.

38:15.493 --> 38:17.633
So you went?
No.

38:20.231 --> 38:21.711
I was scared.

38:23.435 --> 38:25.875
Stewart gets pretty extreme
around Colin.

38:25.937 --> 38:29.247
Any of your other friends know
about this plan?

38:29.307 --> 38:30.507
No.

38:31.476 --> 38:33.506
Just the three of us.

38:33.578 --> 38:37.358
Did Stewart or Colin tell you
what happened at the Prescott's?

38:37.415 --> 38:38.515
No.

38:41.219 --> 38:43.929
But Stewart told me
we had to stick together.

38:45.590 --> 38:47.570
And not to say anything.

38:48.693 --> 38:52.733
JACK: It's over, Stewart,
even your father realizes it.

38:53.598 --> 38:56.078
I've got you for conspiracy,
and if I eat my Wheaties,

38:56.134 --> 38:57.944
I can get you
for second-degree murder,

38:58.002 --> 39:00.742
and I won't care that Colin
actually pulled the trigger.

39:00.805 --> 39:02.875
But I...
NATHAN: Stewart, be quiet.

39:02.941 --> 39:04.281
Mr. McCoy,

39:05.510 --> 39:10.220
what if my son testified that he saw
Colin Harrigan shoot William Prescott,

39:10.281 --> 39:12.351
what could he expect from you?

39:14.519 --> 39:16.559
Would he testify to that?

39:23.428 --> 39:25.908
I'd let him plead to conspiracy
and recommend a minimum...

39:25.964 --> 39:27.534
No, no, no. Not good enough.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.669
He was party to the murder
of an innocent man.

39:29.734 --> 39:31.014
What do you think is fair?

39:31.069 --> 39:33.739
I don't have to be concerned
with that, Mr. McCoy.

39:33.805 --> 39:35.935
Stewart will not be charged.

39:36.474 --> 39:40.514
He will testify in closed court.
His testimony will be sealed.

39:41.546 --> 39:45.316
And nothing will stain his record.
That's our offer.

39:49.053 --> 39:51.763
Barclay has you by your shorts.

39:51.823 --> 39:55.933
You can't get the Harrigan kid
without his son's testimony.

39:55.994 --> 40:00.204
It was his son's idea to go there.
It was his idea to bring the gun.

40:00.965 --> 40:04.135
He's got as much blood on his
hands as Colin Harrigan.

40:04.202 --> 40:06.712
And now he gets to go home
and wash up.

40:07.172 --> 40:10.312
And that's the prize
for blinking first.

40:11.376 --> 40:12.716
It's not right, Adam.

40:12.777 --> 40:16.087
Barclay thinks he can bully us,
'cause he's got money and privilege.

40:16.147 --> 40:19.857
Not to mention that he's the
father of the only eyewitness.

40:20.385 --> 40:23.485
Whether it's fair or not,
this time, money walks.

40:23.555 --> 40:27.365
Well, as of now, everyone's
walking except Tom Harrigan.

40:27.425 --> 40:30.235
That man's ready to burn
at the stake for his son.

40:30.295 --> 40:31.395
Yep.

40:31.763 --> 40:34.843
I'd do the same for my kid.
You'd do the same for yours.

40:34.899 --> 40:38.749
Give Barclay what he wants. Not
unless I absolutely have to.

40:42.640 --> 40:45.310
Even if what Stewart Barclay
says is true,

40:45.376 --> 40:47.906
it's still uncorroborated
accomplice testimony.

40:47.979 --> 40:50.319
It's meaningless. Colin has
nothing to worry about.

40:50.381 --> 40:52.621
JACK: Don't believe it,
Mr. Harrigan.

40:52.684 --> 40:57.294
If I don't hear from your son, I'll be in
front of a grand jury tomorrow morning.

40:57.355 --> 41:00.925
By noon, Colin will be indicted for murder.
You're all talk.

41:00.992 --> 41:03.132
Tomorrow morning, I'm gonna
finish what I started.

41:03.194 --> 41:05.704
If you go ahead
with the allocution,

41:05.764 --> 41:07.444
you do it without
the sentence agreement.

41:07.498 --> 41:08.668
So what?

41:08.733 --> 41:12.813
Then I do 25-to-life
instead of 15. I don't care.

41:13.504 --> 41:15.514
Prescott had it coming.

41:15.573 --> 41:17.853
The whole time Colin
was growing up,

41:17.909 --> 41:20.519
I'd see these prep school kids
on my way to work.

41:20.578 --> 41:23.418
They had their blazers,
their gray pants,

41:23.481 --> 41:28.021
and this look that comes from knowing the
whole world is laid out at their feet.

41:28.086 --> 41:31.496
That's what I wanted for him,
to be like them.

41:31.556 --> 41:33.866
And that bastard Prescott
took it away from him.

41:33.925 --> 41:36.125
This is so wrong,
Mr. Harrigan.

41:36.194 --> 41:38.904
I'll make any sacrifice
for Colin.

41:45.003 --> 41:48.283
I sent Colin away to live
with my sister in Pittsburgh.

41:48.339 --> 41:50.839
He's going to get
a second chance.

41:51.543 --> 41:53.453
(GATE BUZZING)

41:54.579 --> 41:57.059
JACK: As long as his father
says he did it,

41:57.115 --> 42:00.525
Colin can always present a plausible
alternative theory for the crime.

42:00.585 --> 42:01.825
We'd never convict him.

42:01.886 --> 42:03.156
So, because you
can't get Colin,

42:03.221 --> 42:05.601
you won't withdraw the charges
against his father?

42:05.657 --> 42:07.027
Some consolation prize.

42:07.091 --> 42:10.661
I'm not about to let go
of the only leverage I have.

42:11.095 --> 42:14.535
Leverage against whom? Tom Harrigan?
Against Colin.

42:14.599 --> 42:16.409
His father sent him
out of the jurisdiction.

42:16.467 --> 42:19.467
I don't believe that it was to
give him a new lease on life.

42:19.537 --> 42:23.487
He wants to keep us away from him.
Or him away from us.

42:24.242 --> 42:27.782
Maybe Colin's on the fence
about his father's martyrdom.

42:28.713 --> 42:31.563
Call Judge Barry
at home about a subpoena.

42:32.016 --> 42:33.716
I want Colin in my office
tomorrow morning.

42:33.785 --> 42:37.055
And tell Nathan Barclay
I want his son there, too.

42:41.259 --> 42:43.029
What's he doing here?

42:45.330 --> 42:49.180
I wanted him to get a good look at
you before you go away for life.

42:49.634 --> 42:51.444
Colin, you and your mother
go home right now.

42:51.502 --> 42:53.412
JACK:
Be quiet, Mr. Harrigan.

43:02.080 --> 43:04.820
There's no plea bargain
anymore, Colin.

43:06.250 --> 43:09.200
Your father will do 25 years,
minimum.

43:10.555 --> 43:14.025
Mr. Prescott's family will make
sure he never gets parole.

43:14.092 --> 43:17.402
Don't listen to him!
It's a death sentence, Colin.

43:19.197 --> 43:21.767
Do you really want
your father to die

43:21.833 --> 43:25.013
in prison
for something you did?

43:29.741 --> 43:33.591
I know what it's like where you grew up.
I know what they say.

43:34.112 --> 43:37.252
You do your own time
for your own crime.

43:41.919 --> 43:44.799
It's time to be
a standup guy, Colin.

43:46.424 --> 43:49.464
It's time to say
who shot William Prescott.

43:49.527 --> 43:50.667
Colin.

43:52.597 --> 43:53.767
Dad...

43:56.100 --> 43:58.380
I'm sorry.
Don't do this.

44:05.743 --> 44:08.783
I shot him.
Oh, my God.

44:13.451 --> 44:15.121
He recognized me.

44:16.621 --> 44:20.591
Said I wasn't good enough to be
in the same school with his kid.

44:22.493 --> 44:25.303
Said I belonged in the dirt
and the tunnels...

44:27.131 --> 44:28.581
with my dad.

44:30.201 --> 44:33.481
Look, manslaughter one, Jack.
We send it to family court.

44:33.538 --> 44:35.978
He shot a man
in the back twice.

44:37.942 --> 44:41.862
He left a widow and two kids.
This doesn't go to family court.

44:41.913 --> 44:43.653
Jack, he's 13.

44:47.785 --> 44:50.095
I'll consider a lesser plea.

44:50.154 --> 44:52.364
But only if he tells me
who was with him.

44:52.423 --> 44:55.673
Nobody. I did it myself.
No!

44:56.427 --> 44:58.667
He told me everything
that happened, Mr. McCoy.

44:58.730 --> 45:02.910
Stewart Barclay was there! Colin,
tell him what he said to you.

45:05.837 --> 45:09.217
He said he shouldn't take it from Prescott.
He told Colin to shoot!

45:09.273 --> 45:13.483
Unless your son testifies to it in
court, it's hearsay. It's inadmissible.

45:13.544 --> 45:16.354
I'm not saying anything.
Stew wasn't there.

45:16.414 --> 45:19.624
Colin, for God's sake...
I'm not a snitch, Dad.

45:19.684 --> 45:22.674
I don't squeal on my friends.
Your friends?

45:24.122 --> 45:29.002
Stewart Barclay is waiting down the
hall right now, ready to sell you out.

45:29.060 --> 45:32.340
I don't care what he does.
I do what I do.

45:35.032 --> 45:36.842
Like you, Dad.

45:36.901 --> 45:38.401
Not like them.

45:42.206 --> 45:46.746
Colin, for the last time.
Don't do this!

45:54.886 --> 45:57.826
Have an officer take him
to Central Booking.

46:11.636 --> 46:16.306
We won't be needing your son's
testimony, Mr. Barclay. Colin confessed.

46:18.376 --> 46:20.446
You can take Stewart home.

46:21.445 --> 46:23.045
He's free to go.
