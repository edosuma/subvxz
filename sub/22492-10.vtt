00:18.979 --> 00:20.879
It's alive!

00:39.233 --> 00:43.169
And despite his elfin size,
Hermey had bigger dreams.

00:43.237 --> 00:46.138
I want to be a dentist!

00:49.710 --> 00:50.677
You moron!

00:50.744 --> 00:53.076
You know nothing about
dentistry!

00:53.146 --> 00:54.170
I want to be a baker.

00:57.284 --> 00:58.478
Yecch! You idiot!

00:58.552 --> 01:00.713
This doughnut's filled with
tinsel!

01:00.787 --> 01:02.482
You know nothing about baking.

01:02.556 --> 01:04.614
I-I-I want to be a
millionaire.

01:06.226 --> 01:09.457
I'd have to say...
"D. nutcracker."

01:09.529 --> 01:10.757
Final answer.

01:10.831 --> 01:13.356
A woman's reproductive organ
is a nutcracker?!

01:13.433 --> 01:16.334
You know nothing about
genitalia!

01:22.976 --> 01:25.410
C-can I please come back,
Santa?

01:25.479 --> 01:26.844
This is all I know.

01:26.913 --> 01:29.905
You're always welcome here,
Hermey.

01:39.493 --> 01:40.824
The point being,

01:40.894 --> 01:43.454
you are more than welcome to
pursue outside interests.

01:43.530 --> 01:45.020
The choice is yours.

01:45.098 --> 01:46.156
# Do-do-do-do #

01:46.233 --> 01:48.428
# I saw mommy kissing
Santa Claus #

01:48.502 --> 01:49.526
I knew it!

01:49.603 --> 01:50.934
That fucking whore!

01:54.675 --> 01:55.801
Where is he?!

01:55.876 --> 01:57.400
Where's that motherfucker
Santa Claus?

01:57.477 --> 01:58.569
What the hell, man?

01:58.645 --> 01:59.942
He's not real.

02:00.013 --> 02:02.675
Do you know how long it takes
to carve an ice door?

02:02.749 --> 02:03.909
Ohh!

02:03.984 --> 02:04.814
Aaaah!

02:04.885 --> 02:07.877
Ohh! Oh, my brothers!

02:07.954 --> 02:11.412
Now... where's Santa Claus?

02:11.491 --> 02:13.152
Oh, no!

02:13.226 --> 02:14.250
Ow! Ow! Ow!

02:14.328 --> 02:15.590
Okay, okay, okay!

02:15.662 --> 02:17.630
He's... he's, uh, delivering
gifts, you know.

02:17.698 --> 02:18.528
That's what he does.

02:18.598 --> 02:20.657
So he's not gonna be back for
quite some time.

02:23.970 --> 02:24.994
Oh, no, wait.

02:25.072 --> 02:26.300
H-he just walked in.

02:26.373 --> 02:27.499
Where have you been?

02:27.574 --> 02:28.404
<i>I know.</i>

02:28.475 --> 02:29.442
Know what?

02:29.509 --> 02:32.569
Suzy saw you kissing
Santa Claus!

02:32.646 --> 02:34.580
That's just a song, silly.

02:39.019 --> 02:40.111
Oh!

02:40.187 --> 02:41.984
That makes sense.

02:42.055 --> 02:44.353
Man, I got to start listening to
more music.

02:44.424 --> 02:46.016
I am fucking the neighbor,
though.

02:46.093 --> 02:47.856
Mike?
How's he doing?

02:47.928 --> 02:50.658
Joseph, why couldn't
you get us a room?

02:50.731 --> 02:52.790
There weren't any rooms left,
Mary.

02:52.866 --> 02:55.858
Oh, my vagina's about to
splat out an entire human being,

02:55.936 --> 02:57.699
and they couldn't find me a
bed?!

02:57.771 --> 02:58.703
It's okay, honey.

02:58.772 --> 02:59.636
This will be fine.

03:00.674 --> 03:02.107
Ohh!

03:02.175 --> 03:03.506
Ew!

03:03.577 --> 03:05.010
Oh, Joseph!

03:05.078 --> 03:07.046
Uhh!

03:07.114 --> 03:08.138
Oh, god!

03:08.215 --> 03:10.513
Whew!
No more falafel for you.

03:10.584 --> 03:11.414
Sorry.

03:11.485 --> 03:12.383
Aaaah!

03:12.452 --> 03:14.010
Okay, okay, now push.

03:14.087 --> 03:15.452
Push.

03:17.190 --> 03:18.817
Okay, that was good, honey.

03:18.892 --> 03:20.086
You're doing great.

03:20.160 --> 03:22.458
I'll go get you some water.

03:22.529 --> 03:23.587
Joseph!

03:26.199 --> 03:27.097
Ew!

03:29.002 --> 03:31.766
Oh!
Oh, here it comes!

03:31.838 --> 03:34.329
Aaaaah!

03:35.709 --> 03:37.301
Aaaaaaah!

03:37.377 --> 03:38.674
Okay, baby, keep breathing.

03:38.745 --> 03:39.575
This is it, now!

03:39.646 --> 03:40.613
Oh, honey, that's it!

03:40.680 --> 03:42.705
I can see it!
I can see the head! Now push!

03:42.783 --> 03:44.512
Aaah!

03:47.287 --> 03:48.413
Our baby!

03:48.488 --> 03:51.389
Little Jesus... he's so
beautiful.

03:52.826 --> 03:54.691
Hello?
Is everything okay?

03:54.761 --> 03:55.887
I heard yelling.

03:55.962 --> 03:57.725
Oh, it's very dark in here.

03:57.798 --> 04:00.926
No-o-o-o-o!

04:01.001 --> 04:03.765
That must be the sign we're
looking for!

04:03.837 --> 04:06.806
The lord Jesus Christ is
born!

04:08.542 --> 04:09.600
Wow! Awesome!

04:09.676 --> 04:10.506
Go, dad!

04:10.577 --> 04:12.306
Oh, my goodness, dear!

04:14.915 --> 04:19.450
Oh, my god!

04:19.519 --> 04:21.146
Oh, my god!
Oh, my god!

04:21.221 --> 04:22.381
Oh-ho!

04:22.456 --> 04:23.650
Oh, no!

04:26.860 --> 04:29.795
Aaaaah!

04:29.863 --> 04:31.160
I'm on fire!

04:34.234 --> 04:36.896
And that's why I converted to
Judaism.

04:36.970 --> 04:37.800
Uh, dad,
that's a great story,

04:37.871 --> 04:40.863
but I think you forgot to
blow out the menorah.

04:40.941 --> 04:42.465
Damn it!

04:43.610 --> 04:44.474
Blam!

04:44.544 --> 04:46.444
My studies!

04:46.513 --> 04:48.538
Oh! These are brand-new.

04:48.615 --> 04:49.809
Slam! Ha!

04:49.883 --> 04:53.546
That's for... uh...
Ah, nerd!

04:57.090 --> 04:58.853
Whoa...

04:58.925 --> 04:59.983
Oomph!

05:00.060 --> 05:01.288
My goodness!

05:01.361 --> 05:04.262
I've fallen into a strange and
magical land.

05:04.331 --> 05:08.563
Well, you're no Excalibur, but
then again, I'm no King Arthur.

05:08.635 --> 05:10.193
Hello, there, stranger.

05:10.270 --> 05:11.134
I'm Mr....

05:11.204 --> 05:12.501
Aah!

05:12.572 --> 05:18.067
M-m-m-monster!

05:18.144 --> 05:20.772
Monster!

05:20.847 --> 05:22.610
Monster, die!

05:24.384 --> 05:25.715
Wow...

05:25.785 --> 05:27.878
I killed that creature.

05:27.954 --> 05:29.854
I'm a hero!

05:29.923 --> 05:31.857
Good job, Excalibur II!

05:31.925 --> 05:34.655
But I'm freezing.

05:34.728 --> 05:37.424
I, the White Witch, have
sensed a new...

05:37.497 --> 05:38.759
Holy shit!

05:38.832 --> 05:40.663
My queen!

05:40.734 --> 05:42.133
Oh, uh...

05:42.202 --> 05:45.968
care to come to my castle and
enjoy some Turkish delight?

05:46.573 --> 05:47.403
Oh, boy!

05:47.474 --> 05:50.136
My first sexual experience
without a computer!

05:50.210 --> 05:52.770
<i>Turkish delight is a candy.</i>

05:52.846 --> 05:54.905
Oh, boy! Candy!

05:54.981 --> 05:58.678
And now, my champion, we will
defeat my enemy,

05:58.752 --> 05:59.582
the talking lion!

05:59.653 --> 06:01.280
What?!
A talking lion?

06:01.354 --> 06:02.651
Pbht!

06:02.722 --> 06:05.589
You mean there's no dragons or
balrogs or ringwraiths?

06:05.659 --> 06:07.456
No, just a talking lion...

06:07.527 --> 06:09.392
Who's an allegory for Jesus.

06:09.462 --> 06:10.986
Well, I don't know.

06:11.064 --> 06:14.556
Even a talking lion is pretty
scary, and I'm not all that...

06:15.735 --> 06:18.260
Your wish is my command.

06:18.338 --> 06:19.737
Whoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!

06:19.806 --> 06:22.206
This is the best larp ever!

06:22.275 --> 06:26.541
Later, I'll show you how to
cross swords!

06:26.613 --> 06:28.137
And now, young children,

06:28.214 --> 06:30.512
may these guide you through your
journeys.

06:30.584 --> 06:33.382
Why is Santa Claus giving us
lethal weapons?

06:33.453 --> 06:35.250
There he is, children!

06:35.322 --> 06:36.152
Kill him!

06:36.222 --> 06:37.985
Whee!

06:47.734 --> 06:50.794
Eat your heart out,
"Worlds of Warcraft"!

06:52.339 --> 06:54.773
<i>This is why kids should read
good Christian fantasy</i>

06:54.841 --> 06:56.103
instead of "Harry Potter."

06:56.176 --> 06:58.736
You see that play with
Daniel Radcliffe's penis?

06:58.812 --> 07:03.977
What kind of question is that
to ask the Jesus-allegory lion?

07:04.050 --> 07:05.017
But, yes.

07:05.085 --> 07:07.178
Whoo-hoo! Hoo-hoo!

07:07.253 --> 07:10.222
300 experience points for me!

07:10.290 --> 07:12.554
Great job, Excalibur III!

07:12.626 --> 07:14.753
I'm bored.
Where'd I leave that nerd?

07:15.729 --> 07:16.821
Oh, thank you, sir.

07:16.896 --> 07:18.261
It's very tight in there.

07:18.331 --> 07:19.525
<i>Oh, not that nerd!</i>

07:20.800 --> 07:21.767
What the...

07:21.835 --> 07:23.132
Yeah! Hoo-hoo!

07:25.071 --> 07:27.335
You're both in big trouble!

07:27.407 --> 07:28.840
It was worth it, my queen.

07:28.908 --> 07:31.399
I hope you know that
this will go down

07:31.478 --> 07:32.410
on your permanent records!

07:32.479 --> 07:33.912
You can't tell my parents.

07:33.980 --> 07:35.811
<i>Do you even go to this
school?!</i>

07:35.882 --> 07:37.509
<i>Do you?</i>

07:37.584 --> 07:38.676
Whoo!

07:38.752 --> 07:40.686
I love office Christmas parties!

07:41.788 --> 07:43.517
Oh, Dave is a riot at these
things!

07:43.590 --> 07:44.488
<i>But I'm Dave.</i>

07:44.557 --> 07:45.455
Then who's...

07:45.525 --> 07:47.459
Dude, we are falling way
behind.

07:47.527 --> 07:49.085
Let's get out of here.

07:54.234 --> 07:55.326
Aaaah!

07:55.402 --> 07:56.596
Oomph!

07:56.670 --> 07:57.830
Oh, no!

07:57.904 --> 07:59.462
We're late for Christmas play
rehearsal.

07:59.539 --> 08:00.369
Don't worry.

08:00.440 --> 08:01.771
Charlie Brown's in charge.

08:01.841 --> 08:04.241
We can just ignore him and dance
repetitively.

08:04.310 --> 08:06.005
I love dancing repetitively.

08:13.687 --> 08:15.746
Linus!
You're awake!

08:15.822 --> 08:18.188
Uh... why am I tied up?

08:18.258 --> 08:20.351
Because you're going to write
me the love letter

08:20.427 --> 08:21.553
I always wanted!

08:21.628 --> 08:22.617
Love letter?

08:22.696 --> 08:24.288
I need to go to a hospital.

08:24.364 --> 08:26.389
I always wanted to be a
nurse.

08:26.466 --> 08:28.900
They have such pretty white
shoes.

08:28.968 --> 08:32.369
Things look bad for ol'
Linus.

08:32.438 --> 08:34.270
Snoopy, have you seen Linus?

08:34.340 --> 08:37.173
He was supposed to walk me to
chemo.

08:37.243 --> 08:39.609
Can you help me find him?

08:53.827 --> 08:55.021
Good grief.

08:55.095 --> 08:56.494
I made snowflake soup!

08:56.563 --> 08:57.894
I know how much you like

08:57.964 --> 08:59.989
catching snowflakes on your
tongue!

09:00.066 --> 09:02.864
So, basically, you made me a
bowl of hot water?

09:04.104 --> 09:05.002
Aaah!

09:05.071 --> 09:07.164
Val Kilmer?

09:07.240 --> 09:08.798
Hey!

09:08.875 --> 09:11.309
You're my brother's dog!

09:18.585 --> 09:21.281
I should've known you'd figure
it out.

09:21.354 --> 09:22.981
You're always so Snoopy!

09:23.056 --> 09:24.318
Oh, hey!

09:24.390 --> 09:26.585
<i>Snoopy... that's your name!</i>

09:26.659 --> 09:28.490
It all makes sense now!

09:33.733 --> 09:35.291
Aah!

09:45.912 --> 09:46.844
Oh, my god!

09:46.913 --> 09:48.642
She just murdered Val Kilmer!

09:48.715 --> 09:52.515
Where's my love letter,
sweet baboo?

09:52.585 --> 09:54.314
This isn't a love letter.

09:54.387 --> 09:56.378
It's a cry for help.

09:56.456 --> 09:58.424
Did you think I'd let you mail
it?!

09:58.491 --> 10:00.482
But, Sally, it's Christmas.

10:00.560 --> 10:01.686
You're right.

10:01.761 --> 10:03.422
I almost forgot.

10:03.496 --> 10:05.794
Does this tree look sturdy
enough?

10:05.865 --> 10:07.833
Uh... f-for what?

10:07.901 --> 10:08.731
Ah!

10:08.802 --> 10:11.134
Sch-u-u-u-ultz!

10:15.341 --> 10:16.535
It... it's done.

10:16.609 --> 10:17.507
Really?!

10:17.577 --> 10:18.635
Can I read it?

10:18.711 --> 10:21.578
"Dear Sally,
see the words on this page?

10:21.648 --> 10:24.640
Please keep your eyes on them so
you don't notice

10:24.717 --> 10:26.412
the thing I'm about to do."

10:26.486 --> 10:27.953
Wow, I'm hook...

10:36.896 --> 10:38.523
Shh. Shh.

10:38.598 --> 10:41.328
It's almost over. Shh.

10:42.802 --> 10:44.326
Linus, thank goodness!

10:44.404 --> 10:46.201
I've looked everywhere for you.

10:46.272 --> 10:48.832
<i>I was in your house,
you blockhead!</i>

10:48.908 --> 10:49.897
Good grief...

10:49.976 --> 10:51.466
I can't do anything right.

10:51.544 --> 10:53.774
Even my sister's a psycho.

10:53.847 --> 10:55.337
I never thought she
was that bad.

10:55.415 --> 10:57.576
She wasn't that bad at all,
really.

10:57.650 --> 10:59.845
Maybe she just needed
a little love.

11:01.988 --> 11:04.752
By the way,
Val Kilmer's dead.
