WEBVTT

00:25.731 --> 00:27.315
(boom)

00:46.929 --> 00:48.932
(panting)

01:00.200 --> 01:02.203
(sluggish) Come on!

01:09.200 --> 01:11.203
(sluggish) It's right on top of us!

01:11.280 --> 01:13.950
(sluggish) Dial home, Captain!
That's an order!

01:31.963 --> 01:34.926
(sluggish) We're not gonna make it, sir!

01:34.963 --> 01:38.009
(sluggish) We'll make it! Dial now!

01:49.885 --> 01:55.311
Look, I know I should know this by now.
I swear, it'll be the last time I ask.

01:56.365 --> 01:58.787
But these wormholes we go through,...

01:58.847 --> 02:01.141
..they're not always there, right?

02:01.207 --> 02:04.837
No, sir. They can only form
between two open gates.

02:04.849 --> 02:07.352
What's with the worm part?

02:07.408 --> 02:09.578
The worm thing - I don't get that.

02:09.646 --> 02:12.860
Uh... That's just a metaphor.

02:12.889 --> 02:15.475
Right. I knew that.

02:19.169 --> 02:21.631
Imagine the galaxy is an apple.

02:21.689 --> 02:24.652
We burrow our way
through the apple like a worm,...

02:24.691 --> 02:29.156
..crossing from one side to the other,
instead of going around the outside.

02:30.931 --> 02:32.099
OK.

02:33.329 --> 02:38.045
Now, the diameter of the apple is just
a 2-D representation of space-time.

02:38.012 --> 02:40.598
Well, the hole isn't really a hole,
per se...

02:40.651 --> 02:42.780
..but an inter-dimensional conduit...

02:42.852 --> 02:43.812
Colonel?

02:44.812 --> 02:46.397
OK.

02:49.332 --> 02:50.918
I'll be all right.

02:51.013 --> 02:52.848
OK.

02:52.933 --> 02:55.062
(Stargate alarm)

02:56.373 --> 02:58.877
We've got an unscheduled
incoming traveller.

03:02.294 --> 03:03.881
Closing iris.

03:08.935 --> 03:10.937
We're getting a signal.

03:12.094 --> 03:15.641
- Who've we got out there?
- SG teams four, six and ten...

03:15.657 --> 03:18.453
..are the only units presently off world, sir.

03:18.497 --> 03:22.753
- Daniel's with six, isn't he?
- Yeah, he's on a dig on PX3-808.

03:22.736 --> 03:26.575
The computer can't identify the signal.
It's not a GDO transmission.

03:26.578 --> 03:28.330
Let me hear it, Lieutenant.

03:32.257 --> 03:33.925
(low booming)

03:35.418 --> 03:38.713
Intermittent RF pulses, low frequency.

03:39.740 --> 03:44.329
- What have we got?
- Don't know, sir. Some kind of signal.

03:44.300 --> 03:49.348
There's a repeating pattern. Play it
through the computer again, a lot faster.

03:49.300 --> 03:51.137
I'm trying 200%.

03:52.740 --> 03:54.743
(high booming)

03:54.820 --> 03:56.531
Go six.

03:56.621 --> 03:59.082
(beeping and screeching)

04:00.420 --> 04:04.760
The computer now recognises the signal.
It's SG-10's iris code.

04:04.742 --> 04:06.704
That's Henry Boyd's team.

04:08.703 --> 04:11.373
Why would their code
be coming through so slowly?

04:11.383 --> 04:14.346
I have no idea, sir,
but if we don't open the iris...

04:14.383 --> 04:18.055
The next thud we hear...
will be Henry Boyd's team.

04:18.064 --> 04:19.608
Do it.

04:32.784 --> 04:35.204
Come on, Hank, the door's open.

04:42.947 --> 04:44.658
What happened?

04:44.745 --> 04:46.750
I don't know, sir.

04:46.826 --> 04:50.290
General, SG-1 would like
the rescue mission.

04:50.307 --> 04:53.396
- Not yet, Colonel.
- Hank would do the same for us.

04:53.428 --> 04:55.891
I know he would -
if and when I gave the order.

04:55.949 --> 04:59.829
In the meantime, I want a probe
on the ramp and ready to go a.s.a.p.

04:59.829 --> 05:03.709
Colonel, have units SG-1 and 3
geared up and standing by.

06:16.918 --> 06:20.591
(Hammond) SG-10 was on a routine
exploratory mission of P3W-451 .

06:20.598 --> 06:23.560
(Carter) It's a binary system.
We just discovered it.

06:23.598 --> 06:26.394
- Any indications of enemy attack?
- None.

06:26.439 --> 06:28.567
The one thing Boyd reported was that...

06:28.639 --> 06:33.189
..whatever indigenous life there may have
been on 451 recently became extinct.

06:33.159 --> 06:35.663
They were trying to determine the cause.

06:35.720 --> 06:38.391
In the event I authorise this mission,...

06:38.399 --> 06:40.403
..SG-3 will back you up.

06:42.362 --> 06:45.574
- In the event, sir?
- Chevron three encoded.

06:45.601 --> 06:48.439
Let's see what pictures
the probe sends back.

06:48.480 --> 06:52.779
Make a proper threat determination.
You could gate into an ambush...

06:52.762 --> 06:57.435
I recommended Major Boyd for this.
If he's in trouble, I want to go in.

06:57.403 --> 06:59.156
I'm aware of that, Colonel.

06:59.244 --> 07:01.247
(lieutenant) Chevron four encoded.

07:01.322 --> 07:03.033
Yes, sir.

07:08.324 --> 07:09.658
Chevron five encoded.

07:09.764 --> 07:13.769
Major Boyd is a capable warrior, O'Neill.
You trained him well.

07:16.245 --> 07:17.622
Yeah.

07:20.805 --> 07:22.809
Chevron six encoded.

07:29.528 --> 07:31.656
Chevron seven locked.

07:35.927 --> 07:37.930
OK for MALP transports.

07:48.209 --> 07:51.630
Probe should reach
the Stargate ofP3W-451...

07:51.649 --> 07:55.029
..in five seconds... four... three,...

07:55.050 --> 07:56.343
..two,...

07:56.449 --> 07:57.619
..now.

08:02.492 --> 08:04.577
I don't understand. It's just...

08:05.531 --> 08:07.033
Red, sir.

08:07.132 --> 08:09.134
Are we receiving telemetry?

08:09.211 --> 08:12.675
Yes, sir, but
at an even slower rate than before.

08:12.692 --> 08:14.278
There is an image here.

08:14.372 --> 08:18.920
Input the video feed into the computer but
compensate for a longer light wavelength.

08:18.893 --> 08:22.064
- Step it up in 20 millimicron increments.
- Captain?

08:22.091 --> 08:26.057
Sir, it's possible that the image
from the probe has red shifted,...

08:26.053 --> 08:29.016
..distorted toward
the infrared end of the spectrum.

08:29.055 --> 08:30.348
Why?

08:30.454 --> 08:32.833
The same reason
their codes were so slow.

08:32.894 --> 08:34.647
(Carter) Yeah.

08:34.734 --> 08:36.278
Whatever that is.

08:38.014 --> 08:39.643
It's working.

08:50.336 --> 08:52.338
What the hell's goin' on, Hank?

08:53.937 --> 08:58.360
- Is something pursuing them?
- Try playing back the video in real time.

08:58.336 --> 09:02.092
- We need to find out...
- This is all we've received so far, sir.

09:02.097 --> 09:05.436
Eleven frames of digital picture
in the last six minutes.

09:05.457 --> 09:09.715
- That represents a fraction of a second.
- Perhaps a malfunction.

09:09.697 --> 09:13.412
No, the picture tells us
everything we need to know.

09:13.419 --> 09:16.799
That team is in trouble.
Probably under attack.

09:16.821 --> 09:19.073
- Permission to go in, sir?
- Negative, sir.

09:19.942 --> 09:21.653
What do you mean, negative?

09:23.581 --> 09:28.297
I'm sorry, Colonel. With all due respect.
But if I'm right, we can't help them.

09:29.381 --> 09:34.264
The camera may respond to commands.
See if you can tilt up for a wider image.

09:34.221 --> 09:37.851
I think I know what
Major Boyd seems so afraid of.

09:45.543 --> 09:48.630
There! Isolate that area
and digitally enhance.

09:57.423 --> 10:00.846
- What am I looking at?
- That's a black hole, sir.

10:00.865 --> 10:03.534
(Carter) A newly formed one,
by the looks of it.

10:03.546 --> 10:08.761
P3W-451 was orbiting its companion star.
The orbit's probably pulling them closer.

10:08.706 --> 10:11.586
Why don't they just gate out of there?

10:11.625 --> 10:14.547
They're trying to,
but the closer you get to a black hole...

10:14.586 --> 10:16.505
Time slows down.

10:18.787 --> 10:20.956
It almost appears to stand still.

10:21.027 --> 10:22.696
From our perspective, yes.

10:22.787 --> 10:26.125
But time is relative.
As far as SG-10 is concerned...

10:26.147 --> 10:30.153
..only a few seconds have passed.
They're still trying to save themselves.

10:30.149 --> 10:31.860
What will happen to them?

10:31.950 --> 10:36.624
Time dilation is a result of the intense
gravity, which is directly proportional...

10:36.588 --> 10:38.591
Captain!

10:39.750 --> 10:41.001
Sorry, sir.

10:44.270 --> 10:47.692
Their bodies will be pulled apart
by increasing tidal forces.

10:50.831 --> 10:53.961
They did manage
to activate the Stargate once.

10:53.993 --> 10:57.248
But to them, it can't have been open
for more than a second.

10:57.272 --> 11:00.192
There's nothing we can do to save them?

11:00.231 --> 11:02.192
They've had it, sir.

11:02.273 --> 11:05.735
- You know that for a fact, Colonel?
- No, sir, I don't.

11:05.753 --> 11:09.008
But look at Major Boyd's face.
What does that say to you?

11:14.313 --> 11:17.485
Very well. Disengage the Stargate.

11:17.514 --> 11:19.434
Sir...

11:19.514 --> 11:21.518
By some fluke of technology,...

11:21.595 --> 11:25.517
..we are witnessing something
that the laws of physics say we can't.

11:25.514 --> 11:29.437
We are witnessing good men
dying in slow motion, Captain.

11:33.596 --> 11:35.097
You're right, sir.

11:37.355 --> 11:38.732
Shut it down.

11:46.837 --> 11:48.006
Sir,...

11:48.118 --> 11:50.120
..it won't disengage.

11:50.198 --> 11:52.076
- Try again.
- I already have, sir.

11:52.158 --> 11:53.326
Twice.

11:53.438 --> 11:55.317
It won't shut down.

12:07.121 --> 12:09.918
Let's go! Let's go! Move! Move!

12:24.081 --> 12:27.671
Sergeant, how long have you been
out of contact with this facility?

12:27.682 --> 12:30.062
Coming up four hours ago, sir.

12:30.124 --> 12:32.586
But it was funky for a while before that.

12:32.644 --> 12:36.899
Is that proper military terminology?
What does "funky" mean, Sergeant?

12:36.884 --> 12:41.932
Everyone was talkin' real slow, like when
the battery's down on your Walkman.

12:41.884 --> 12:43.636
Uh-huh.

12:44.565 --> 12:47.736
Will that shaft take me
directly to sub-level 28?

12:47.764 --> 12:50.561
Yes, sir, but I don't know
how you're gonna get down.

12:50.605 --> 12:52.149
Not to worry.

12:52.246 --> 12:55.835
We brought our own transportation.
Gentlemen, hook 'em up!

13:01.246 --> 13:02.832
Rig it!

13:04.126 --> 13:05.712
Clear!

13:09.568 --> 13:11.572
This is Major General Hammond.

13:11.648 --> 13:15.070
I have an urgent matter
to discuss with the president.

13:24.009 --> 13:27.347
Sergeant, try disconnecting
the superconductive interface.

13:27.370 --> 13:29.789
Already tried that, Captain. It's stuck.

13:29.850 --> 13:32.897
- Teal'c, Siler could use a hand.
- I will assist.

13:39.890 --> 13:43.230
- Captain Carter.
- I was just on my way to report, sir.

13:43.253 --> 13:47.842
The capacitor should have discharged,
but the gate is drawing power directly.

13:47.812 --> 13:51.775
Isn't there a time limit to how long
a wormhole can be maintained?

13:51.773 --> 13:53.775
Yes, sir, we just passed it.

13:53.852 --> 13:55.855
Then how is this possible?

13:55.933 --> 14:00.774
I'd guess that since time is passing more
slowly on P3W-451 relative to Earth,...

14:00.732 --> 14:05.282
..we're experiencing a paradox
the Stargate was never designed for.

14:09.655 --> 14:12.076
Why in God's name is it doing that?

14:13.975 --> 14:16.062
I've no idea, sir.

14:16.135 --> 14:19.265
It started after you got on line
with the president, sir.

14:19.296 --> 14:22.717
- I never got through to him.
- (lieutenant) Beg your pardon, sir.

14:22.736 --> 14:25.991
It seems we've lost communication
below sub-level 24.

14:26.015 --> 14:29.270
- Nearest secure phone above that?
- NORAD, sir. Main level.

14:29.297 --> 14:33.010
- I won't be long. Meantime, Colonel...
- Understood, sir.

14:35.538 --> 14:37.124
Carter...

14:38.139 --> 14:41.309
What would happen
if we just... pulled the plug?

14:51.620 --> 14:54.832
OK, Carter. We've reached
the main power vault.

14:54.861 --> 14:57.198
We'll isolate the capacitors first.

14:58.182 --> 14:59.642
Panel six.

14:59.740 --> 15:03.831
Colonel, pull breakers
90 through 94 on panel 6.

15:04.822 --> 15:07.033
Roger that. Stand by.

15:10.981 --> 15:12.567
Stand clear, people.

15:12.662 --> 15:14.874
I have no idea what this is gonna do.

15:15.864 --> 15:18.283
We must vacate this area.

15:23.224 --> 15:25.309
We're kinda shortin' out up here.

15:25.384 --> 15:27.428
- Main breaker?
- It'll overload.

15:27.504 --> 15:28.588
We gotta do it.

15:28.705 --> 15:30.707
Colonel, pull the main breaker.

15:33.985 --> 15:35.153
On...

15:35.265 --> 15:37.018
..three, two, one!

15:53.668 --> 15:55.879
Colonel, are you all right?

15:55.947 --> 15:57.951
Medical emergency in the gate room!

15:59.667 --> 16:02.004
(Carter) Colonel, are you all right?

16:08.029 --> 16:10.826
Siler's hurt. Did it work?

16:10.870 --> 16:13.581
No. Even with the power cut,
it won't shut down.

16:13.629 --> 16:15.966
How's that possible?

16:16.030 --> 16:18.743
It must be deriving its energy
from the black hole.

16:18.789 --> 16:24.006
- Get a med team to the main power vault.
- Med team to the main power vault!

16:23.951 --> 16:26.746
The MALP is now
on emergency internal power.

16:32.834 --> 16:34.836
Help's on the way.

16:36.993 --> 16:39.455
Do not concern yourself with my injury.

16:39.514 --> 16:42.518
You're badly burned, Teal'c. Even for you.

16:47.432 --> 16:49.061
The Stargate...

17:06.517 --> 17:08.519
Lieutenant, close the iris!

17:08.596 --> 17:11.768
It's an outgoing wormhole.
Nothing can come through.

17:11.796 --> 17:14.842
Except for the black hole's gravity!
Now, close it!

17:14.876 --> 17:17.047
Close the iris.

17:22.919 --> 17:24.922
(beeping)

17:29.680 --> 17:32.808
- Hold fire! It's the general!
- What's going on? Who are you?

17:32.839 --> 17:35.802
Major Davis, sir.
Office of the Joint Chiefs. Come with me.

17:35.839 --> 17:39.052
- Why are these men here?
- We were under the impression...

17:39.078 --> 17:41.082
..there had been an alien incursion.

17:41.160 --> 17:44.332
Special Forces were sent
before we knew what was going on.

17:44.363 --> 17:47.951
I'll brief you on the way to your aircraft.
Time is of the essence.

17:47.961 --> 17:52.425
We've got an emergency situation!
I'm not leaving until I talk to the president.

17:52.402 --> 17:54.780
He wants to see you personally, sir.

17:54.842 --> 17:59.557
Your aircraft is standing by on the tarmac.
It is urgent that we leave immediately.

17:59.521 --> 18:01.776
Lead the way.

18:09.244 --> 18:11.789
Freeze! Up against the wall! Move! Move!

18:13.005 --> 18:14.589
Tags!

18:17.724 --> 18:20.770
- Dr Fraiser.
- Who the hell are you? Put that down!

18:20.806 --> 18:23.769
Colonel Frank Cromwell -
Air Force Special Operations.

18:23.805 --> 18:28.436
Five hours ago, all contact was lost with
this facility. I am here to find out why.

18:28.405 --> 18:29.365
Colonel,...

18:29.487 --> 18:31.490
..there's a medical emergency!

18:31.567 --> 18:34.948
My superiors believe the SGC
has been overrun by alien hostiles.

18:34.968 --> 18:37.180
Well, they've been misinformed.

18:37.247 --> 18:42.171
From what I have read about this place,
Dr Fraiser, hell, you could be one of 'em!

18:42.127 --> 18:44.089
Move out!

18:44.167 --> 18:45.753
Sector six!

18:56.250 --> 18:59.588
We hoped that someone like you
would confirm our hypothesis.

18:59.611 --> 19:02.031
- Which is?
- We now know...

19:02.090 --> 19:05.304
..the SGC is experiencing
what is called "time dilation".

19:05.330 --> 19:09.170
Time is literally passing slower
within the facility than it is topside.

19:09.171 --> 19:11.633
Hence the communications problems.

19:11.691 --> 19:15.446
Yes, sir. We also know that
only two things could cause this effect.

19:15.451 --> 19:18.748
Velocities near the speed of light,
or extreme gravity.

19:18.772 --> 19:23.990
Approximately ten minutes ago
we established a wormhole to a planet...

19:23.932 --> 19:27.105
..at or very near
the event horizon of a black hole.

19:27.133 --> 19:30.555
Since time is nearly at a standstill
on the other side,...

19:30.575 --> 19:33.453
..you've been unable
to disengage the Stargate.

19:33.493 --> 19:38.835
That was our hypothesis. Keep in mind
we've had more time to think about it.

19:38.733 --> 19:42.322
They'll be conferencing you
with the president on the aircraft.

19:42.336 --> 19:43.505
Thank you, Major.

19:43.615 --> 19:45.035
Good luck, sir.

20:08.219 --> 20:10.221
Siler took a pretty good hit.

20:10.299 --> 20:12.010
How're you doing, Teal'c?

20:12.098 --> 20:16.230
I suffered simple electrical burns,
O'Neill. Nothing more.

20:16.220 --> 20:19.557
He'll be out of commission for a few days.

20:22.380 --> 20:23.548
Carter?

20:23.661 --> 20:27.333
Gravity waves. I assumed
the wormhole would insulate us...

20:27.339 --> 20:30.260
..from the black hole's gravitational field.

20:30.300 --> 20:33.472
But our space-time has begun to warp,
just like on P3W-451 .

20:33.501 --> 20:35.003
Will you stop that!

20:36.621 --> 20:39.750
- We're in trouble, sir.
- Thank you.

20:42.383 --> 20:44.635
Think of something.

20:45.462 --> 20:47.048
Yes, sir.

20:52.344 --> 20:54.346
(Dr Fraiser) Colonel!

20:54.423 --> 20:56.427
(Cromwell) Clear!

20:59.465 --> 21:02.511
- Cromwell?
- You know this guy, sir?

21:02.546 --> 21:04.548
Oh, yeah.

21:04.625 --> 21:05.960
Go. Go on.

21:11.786 --> 21:13.580
Been a while.

21:13.665 --> 21:15.085
Yeah.

21:15.186 --> 21:16.564
Five hours.

21:16.665 --> 21:20.253
You've got everybody worried upstairs.
Where's the general?

21:20.268 --> 21:22.563
What's the five hours?

21:22.626 --> 21:25.798
That's how long this facility
has been out of contact.

21:25.827 --> 21:28.289
The Pentagon suspects alien hostiles.

21:30.308 --> 21:32.019
And they sent you?

21:40.429 --> 21:42.432
(whistles)

21:44.030 --> 21:46.367
(Cromwell) So, this is the Stargate?

21:48.550 --> 21:51.471
- What's the problem?
- We gated to a planet...

21:51.510 --> 21:53.847
..that's being sucked up by a black hole.

21:55.951 --> 21:57.954
Very bad. Very dangerous.

21:58.031 --> 22:00.035
Why is that?

22:01.471 --> 22:03.473
Things tend to get sucked in.

22:06.833 --> 22:11.840
- I took the liberty of closing the iris, sir.
- Captain Carter, Colonel Cromwell.

22:12.555 --> 22:14.473
He's come to rescue us.

22:15.633 --> 22:17.219
But don't count on it.

22:17.314 --> 22:21.028
The Pentagon thought you were
under alien attack when they lost contact.

22:21.035 --> 22:23.913
- How long ago?
- A little over five hours ago. Why?

22:24.913 --> 22:27.750
My watch reads 1 330 hours.
What does yours say?

22:27.795 --> 22:30.715
Running slow, Captain. It's almost 1900.

22:30.756 --> 22:32.884
Damn it! I have to get off this level.

22:32.955 --> 22:36.127
(sluggish) Captain Carter?

22:36.237 --> 22:38.365
What have you got, Lieutenant?

22:38.435 --> 22:41.566
(sluggish) The field is expanding.

22:43.436 --> 22:47.067
(sluggish) I'm reading
over seven G's at the iris.

22:47.077 --> 22:48.622
Keep your distance.

22:49.037 --> 22:50.413
Sir...

22:50.518 --> 22:55.317
The warping of our space-time seems to
be in advance of the gravitational field...

22:55.278 --> 22:57.281
..rather than as a result of it.

22:57.359 --> 23:00.823
It's probably a lensing effect
generated by the Stargate.

23:03.398 --> 23:07.739
- Don't even pretend you understood that.
- The point is, sirs,...

23:07.720 --> 23:10.682
..time is passing more slowly
down here than it is outside.

23:10.721 --> 23:13.767
- Time is time.
- No, sir, not according to relativity.

23:13.799 --> 23:17.597
With the intense gravity field
of a black hole, time slows down.

23:17.601 --> 23:21.273
- We are not in a black hole.
- Not yet.

23:21.282 --> 23:25.372
But we are connected to
its gravitational field through the Stargate.

23:25.362 --> 23:27.365
It's expanding in this direction...

23:27.442 --> 23:31.615
..like a bubble slowly extending outward.
That's why I have to leave, sir.

23:31.603 --> 23:36.736
I have to contact the Pentagon before the
gravity field extends past the gate room.

23:36.683 --> 23:41.106
I just came from there myself, Captain.
Colonel Cromwell, I believe.

23:41.084 --> 23:42.920
General Hammond.

23:43.003 --> 23:46.343
- You came from Washington, sir?
- There and back again.

23:46.365 --> 23:50.204
After someone upstairs managed
to explain what was going on to me...

23:50.204 --> 23:55.253
..we called an all-night session with the
president. I've been gone nearly 18 hours.

23:56.486 --> 23:58.990
I thought you were on the phone.

23:59.047 --> 24:02.009
The time dilation is getting worse
as the field expands.

24:02.046 --> 24:05.092
That's the consensus.
We've set up a command post...

24:05.125 --> 24:08.423
..right on top of the mountain
to monitor the expansion.

24:08.448 --> 24:12.578
- I have to get up there.
- The experts we consulted believe...

24:12.568 --> 24:16.157
..we have to begin an autodestruct
sequence to destroy the Stargate.

24:16.167 --> 24:17.920
Sweet.

24:18.008 --> 24:20.261
They assure me that the gravity field...

24:20.328 --> 24:24.460
..now present around the gate will contain
the blast within the mountain...

24:24.450 --> 24:27.371
..and pose no threat to civilians.

24:27.410 --> 24:30.623
- With respect, sir, I don't think so.
- If we don't try,...

24:30.648 --> 24:33.903
..we lose the planet, right through that.

24:33.931 --> 24:38.896
We may succeed in destroying the base,
but leave the gate and wormhole intact.

24:38.851 --> 24:40.854
What happens to the planet then?

24:40.932 --> 24:45.313
Orders have been given, Captain.
It is our duty to carry out those orders.

24:45.291 --> 24:47.671
- But, sir...
- The decision has been made.

24:47.732 --> 24:51.404
Those people up there have been working
on this longer than you have.

24:51.412 --> 24:54.165
- It's what they came up with.
- Yes, sir.

24:54.211 --> 24:57.843
I'm ordering the evacuation of the SGC,
effective as of right now.

24:57.855 --> 25:03.404
I'll need two volunteers to stay behind in
order to give our personnel a head start.

25:03.334 --> 25:06.003
- I'll stay, sir.
- Me too, sir.

25:08.855 --> 25:10.858
Anyone else?

25:13.096 --> 25:15.516
Looks like you're stuck with me, Jack.

25:16.294 --> 25:19.799
Done! It takes two officers
to initiate the countdown.

25:21.617 --> 25:23.953
Attention! This is General Hammond.

25:24.896 --> 25:29.320
All personnel are ordered to
evacuate this facility immediately.

25:29.297 --> 25:30.423
Repeat!

25:30.537 --> 25:34.084
All personnel report to
the main level immediately.

25:34.856 --> 25:36.859
That is all.

25:36.938 --> 25:38.941
Let's move it. On my count.

25:39.017 --> 25:41.186
Three, two, one.

25:41.258 --> 25:43.260
Easy. Watch his chest.

25:44.138 --> 25:46.142
Move him out. Let's go.

25:49.380 --> 25:51.675
Wait five minutes,
then start the countdown.

25:51.740 --> 25:53.242
- Good luck.
- Thanks, sir.

25:53.339 --> 25:56.970
Make sure you give yourself
enough time to get out, sir.

25:56.980 --> 25:58.567
Time...

25:58.661 --> 25:59.788
Right.

26:19.023 --> 26:21.193
General, we were getting worried.

26:21.263 --> 26:23.727
- How long have I been gone?
- 22 hours, sir.

26:23.784 --> 26:26.955
- General Cohen's waiting for you.
- Thank you, Sergeant.

26:26.982 --> 26:32.074
- I reckon I was gone 20 minutes.
- Well, sir, accounting for travelling time...

26:32.025 --> 26:37.407
..I'd guess time within the SGC facility
has slowed to about 600% below normal.

26:37.346 --> 26:42.394
You ordered O'Neill to wait five minutes -
that's really six hours, maybe more.

26:42.346 --> 26:45.017
Captain, relativity gives me a headache.

26:52.865 --> 26:56.038
- Who's this?
- Henry Boyd.

26:56.068 --> 26:58.197
Good officer.

26:58.268 --> 26:59.854
Smart.

27:02.749 --> 27:05.294
And he reminds me of Carter a little bit.

27:07.509 --> 27:10.012
This was their first mission as a team.

27:10.069 --> 27:12.198
He looks scared to death.

27:12.269 --> 27:16.025
He's on a planet that's about to be
swallowed up by a black hole.

27:16.028 --> 27:18.031
And he knows it.

27:29.832 --> 27:31.417
Thank you.

27:35.352 --> 27:37.771
Uh... No. Thank you.

27:48.194 --> 27:50.656
Perhaps with rest the answers will come.

27:50.714 --> 27:52.509
Hey, Teal'c.

27:53.355 --> 27:56.025
You know anything
about quantum gravity?

27:59.395 --> 28:01.273
Nothing.

28:01.355 --> 28:03.358
Apparently, neither do I.

28:04.394 --> 28:08.192
- What do these equations represent?
- Probably a life's work.

28:09.596 --> 28:12.393
I don't have that much time,
unfortunately.

28:19.116 --> 28:21.119
How may I be of assistance?

28:23.759 --> 28:28.932
We're experiencing a time dilation,
in a radius wider than the gate room itself.

28:28.877 --> 28:31.339
Most of the SGC, in fact,
and it's expanding.

28:31.398 --> 28:35.322
But it's all happening in advance
of the gravity field that's causing it.

28:35.319 --> 28:39.826
According to everything I thought I knew
about relativity, that is not possible.

28:39.800 --> 28:41.552
- Yet it is so.
- Right.

28:41.640 --> 28:44.310
If it wasn't,
we'd all be pulled apart by now.

28:46.161 --> 28:50.584
They're proceeding with a plan
that makes assumptions about gravity...

28:50.561 --> 28:55.569
..and space-time, with no regard for the
fact that it contradicts our observations.

28:55.520 --> 28:57.731
I see.

28:57.801 --> 29:01.223
In other words, they don't know
what the hell is going on,...

29:01.242 --> 29:03.288
..so they're just gonna blow it up.

29:05.202 --> 29:07.915
There doesn't seem to be
a damn thing we can do.

29:16.284 --> 29:18.578
Let's get set up.

29:20.204 --> 29:25.547
The computer needs your code before it'll
accept the command. Go on and enter it.

29:37.727 --> 29:40.397
Maybe now you know how it feels.

29:40.406 --> 29:41.992
You done?

29:43.847 --> 29:45.224
Roger that.

29:45.327 --> 29:48.583
When the time comes,
hit the enter key on my mark...

29:50.730 --> 29:52.732
..and then run like hell.

29:54.288 --> 29:56.291
Got it.

30:01.369 --> 30:03.163
Two minutes.

30:15.530 --> 30:20.455
The gravity field reaches the blast doors
of the control room now. That's not good.

30:20.413 --> 30:23.291
I take it you still believe
our plan won't work.

30:24.932 --> 30:29.272
I'm afraid the gravity field
will dampen the effects of the explosion.

30:29.252 --> 30:32.173
We'll lose the SGC,
but the wormhole will be intact.

30:32.212 --> 30:36.176
The mountain will collapse into it.
Six months later, all of Colorado.

30:36.174 --> 30:37.551
Six months after that...

30:40.453 --> 30:42.708
At least Daniel will live out there.

30:42.776 --> 30:45.363
If you're wrong,
and for once I hope you are,...

30:45.415 --> 30:49.130
..we can restart the SGC with
the second Stargate at Nellis. In time...

30:49.135 --> 30:50.387
Wait a minute.

30:50.497 --> 30:53.209
Sir, that's it.

30:53.256 --> 30:57.011
We do use a bomb, but we focus
the energy of the blast.

30:57.016 --> 30:59.936
Colonel O'Neill and I
were sent to the Antarctic gate...

30:59.978 --> 31:02.147
..because we were under enemy fire.

31:02.219 --> 31:04.055
It caused an energy surge.

31:04.137 --> 31:09.520
Yes, and that surge caused the wormhole
to jump from one destination to another.

31:09.458 --> 31:13.588
If we can channel enough energy
in the direction of our Stargate,...

31:13.578 --> 31:18.086
..it should cut us off from the black hole,
causing the matter stream to jump...

31:18.057 --> 31:21.814
- ..to another gate.
- Leaving ours linked to some other world.

31:21.820 --> 31:24.074
Yes, but all we have to do is shut it down.

31:24.141 --> 31:26.979
Sir, we have to stop Colonel O'Neill.

31:38.142 --> 31:39.727
One minute.

31:44.781 --> 31:46.785
Maybe the last one.

31:57.384 --> 31:59.177
We used to be friends, Jack.

32:01.224 --> 32:02.685
Yep.

32:02.785 --> 32:06.582
I was sick to my stomach
when I found out you were still alive.

32:06.585 --> 32:08.421
I wanted to go back for you.

32:10.705 --> 32:13.794
Why don't we just do this
and get the hell out of here?

32:13.826 --> 32:17.583
Somebody dropped a dime on us!
You got hit! You went down!

32:17.586 --> 32:20.173
I made a judgement call to save the team!

32:20.227 --> 32:22.689
And I saw you take off!

32:22.747 --> 32:26.836
And then I spent four months of my life
in some stinking Iraqi prison!

32:26.826 --> 32:29.707
- I thought you were dead!
- You thought wrong!

32:32.387 --> 32:36.519
What do you want? You want me
to forgive you? Is that it?

32:39.549 --> 32:41.134
Yeah.

32:41.709 --> 32:43.711
I guess I do.

32:43.788 --> 32:46.084
Well, that's tough.

32:46.150 --> 32:48.988
What happened to
"Nobody gets left behind"?

32:49.029 --> 32:50.490
Well, what about him?

32:52.150 --> 32:54.361
That is a totally different scenario.

32:54.430 --> 32:57.769
That is the same damn thing, Jack!

33:10.633 --> 33:13.679
Don't activate the autodestruct!
It won't work.

33:13.712 --> 33:15.715
I have another idea.

33:33.115 --> 33:37.497
The G-suits should help you withstand
the higher gravity on the way down.

33:37.476 --> 33:40.146
- What's this bomb?
- It's a shaped charge.

33:40.155 --> 33:43.869
To focus the explosive force
toward the wormhole so that it jumps.

33:43.875 --> 33:45.878
Like in Antarctica.

33:45.957 --> 33:47.334
Right.

33:47.438 --> 33:50.401
- Where is it?
- They're modifying the warhead yield.

33:50.438 --> 33:53.567
- It's being flown in from Travis.
- How long will it take?

33:53.597 --> 33:56.519
Well, sir, with any luck,
about five more minutes.

33:56.557 --> 33:59.645
- Relatively...
- Relatively speaking.

33:59.679 --> 34:01.263
..speaking.

34:04.038 --> 34:06.166
Any time you're ready, sirs.

34:06.239 --> 34:10.538
- I don't know how long that iris will hold.
- We have to wait for the bomb.

34:22.041 --> 34:26.047
- You got better quick.
- It has, in fact, been several days.

34:26.041 --> 34:28.045
Yeah, I knew that.

34:28.123 --> 34:30.835
Those who don't have to be here
should go topside.

34:32.963 --> 34:34.340
(O'Neill) Cromwell.

34:40.764 --> 34:43.016
Cannot the bomb
be detonated by remote?

34:43.083 --> 34:46.797
It has to be set a certain distance
from the gate and at an exact angle.

34:46.804 --> 34:50.476
The timer can't be set in advance
due to the variance in time dilation.

34:50.485 --> 34:54.239
- Man, she is...
- Way smarter than we are. I know.

35:40.610 --> 35:42.905
Just like old times, huh, Jack?

35:42.971 --> 35:44.347
Oh, yeah.

35:44.449 --> 35:46.452
Black holes, wormholes,...

35:47.213 --> 35:48.798
..old times.

35:54.373 --> 35:56.208
Sir?

35:56.293 --> 35:58.378
Thank you, Lieutenant.

35:58.452 --> 36:01.708
Do you think they'll be able
to shut it down, sir?

36:01.733 --> 36:03.945
We'll know sometime tomorrow.

36:30.135 --> 36:34.141
(O'Neill) Oh, yeah, yeah.
We're pulling some G's now.

36:34.135 --> 36:37.099
I feel like I've put on
a coupla hundred pounds!

36:37.137 --> 36:39.224
I wasn't gonna say anything.

36:44.619 --> 36:47.039
They appear to be moving very slowly.

36:47.099 --> 36:49.644
Only from our perspective.

36:49.699 --> 36:51.702
Uh, Captain...

36:58.021 --> 37:00.231
Colonel, look out! Colonel!

37:01.221 --> 37:04.391
(echoes) Colonel, look out! Colonel!

37:04.420 --> 37:06.423
Did you hear that?

37:08.780 --> 37:09.865
Look out!

37:17.742 --> 37:19.369
Are you all right?

37:19.461 --> 37:23.217
This is close enough!
Set the timer! 20 seconds!

37:23.224 --> 37:25.768
- You won't make it out.
- 20 seconds!

37:42.905 --> 37:45.492
- It's set!
- Do it!

38:00.628 --> 38:03.925
- I've got you!
- Get up there and arm that damn bomb!

38:03.949 --> 38:06.202
- I've got you! Climb!
- Arm the bomb!

38:06.266 --> 38:08.436
Climb!

39:04.476 --> 39:06.603
(Carter) Teal'c, pull him up!

40:01.922 --> 40:03.925
Hey, Jack, did I miss anything?

40:06.081 --> 40:08.085
I made it.

40:08.163 --> 40:11.001
We all made it,
thanks to you and Captain Carter.

40:13.563 --> 40:14.942
How?

40:15.043 --> 40:19.635
Teal'c managed to pull you far enough
away from the bomb before it went off.

40:20.525 --> 40:22.027
Thanks.

40:22.126 --> 40:24.797
You are welcome.

40:24.806 --> 40:27.351
Most of the blast went
where it was meant to.

40:27.405 --> 40:32.289
The wormhole jumped to P2A-870
and, once it did that, we just shut it off.

40:32.246 --> 40:34.958
Good thinking, Captain.

40:35.005 --> 40:36.717
Thank you, sir.

40:36.806 --> 40:40.521
A new trinium-strengthened iris
is being installed right now.

40:40.527 --> 40:42.947
We should be back in business in no time.

40:43.807 --> 40:45.811
What day is it?

40:48.688 --> 40:54.070
This might be a little difficult to accept but
since you reported for duty yesterday...

40:54.009 --> 40:56.512
..two weeks have actually gone by.

40:57.327 --> 40:59.331
Two weeks?

41:03.251 --> 41:05.253
Think I'll sleep in.

41:06.449 --> 41:08.619
You do that.
