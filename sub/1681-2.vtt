<i>Kids...When I first moved to New York,
it was dingy, disgusting,</i>

00:06.165 --> 00:08.929
<i>dirty, ugly, flea-ridden, stinky</i>

00:09.049 --> 00:11.130
<i>and altogether terrifying,</i>

00:11.544 --> 00:13.149
<i>but then, sadly.</i>

00:13.465 --> 00:16.378
<i>The whole city started to go uphill.</i>

00:17.127 --> 00:18.632
<i>The streets got a little cleaner,</i>

00:18.752 --> 00:21.152
<i>the rents got a little higher,
and one by one,</i>

00:21.272 --> 00:24.126
<i>the crappy old places we loved
began to disappear.</i>

00:24.752 --> 00:27.138
<i>The Elbow Room,
an old punk rock club,</i>

00:27.258 --> 00:28.784
<i>became a drugstore.</i>

00:29.396 --> 00:31.761
<i>McHale's,
a working-class watering hole,</i>

00:31.881 --> 00:33.290
<i>became a fast-food place.</i>

00:33.938 --> 00:36.690
<i>And Fez, a Moroccan-themed lounge,</i>

00:36.969 --> 00:38.212
<i>became a bank.</i>

00:38.515 --> 00:39.790
<i>And not just any bank.</i>

00:39.950 --> 00:41.955
Goliath National Bank.

00:42.114 --> 00:44.121
The world leader
in credit and banking.

00:44.499 --> 00:46.872
God, I love Goliath National Bank!

00:47.816 --> 00:50.287
Okay, first of all, you look like
the last pick in the draft.

00:50.616 --> 00:53.078
And, second, why are you so excited
about some bank?

00:53.369 --> 00:56.293
Our company just bought them
out in a ruthless takeover.

00:56.452 --> 00:59.379
Took two months.
Cost 2,000 jobs.

01:00.410 --> 01:01.841
It was brutal.

01:02.384 --> 01:03.583
Who wants a T-shirt?

01:04.855 --> 01:07.414
Hey, Marshall, they're hiring
in the legal department.

01:07.661 --> 01:08.922
I could get you a job.

01:09.042 --> 01:12.137
Barney, Marshall didn't quit his
last soul-sucking corporate job

01:12.257 --> 01:13.581
just to go work at a bank.

01:13.960 --> 01:16.079
He's gonna be
an environmental lawyer.

01:16.479 --> 01:18.085
<i>That was the plan, anyway.</i>

01:18.204 --> 01:21.036
<i>Over the next few weeks, Marshall
went on a lot of interviews.</i>

01:21.156 --> 01:22.286
You are confident,

01:22.558 --> 01:24.079
you are energetic,

01:24.199 --> 01:25.603
you are focused!

01:25.860 --> 01:27.330
<i>A lot of interviews.</i>

01:27.587 --> 01:29.498
You are flexible on salary,

01:29.877 --> 01:31.409
you're willing to compromise,

01:32.080 --> 01:34.112
you're not gonna cry this time.

01:34.826 --> 01:36.097
<i>Too many interviews.</i>

01:36.217 --> 01:37.426
You are sad,

01:38.097 --> 01:39.491
you are beaten down,

01:39.927 --> 01:42.449
you will get through this,
come home,

01:42.866 --> 01:45.804
get in your big underpants
and take a nap.

01:47.232 --> 01:49.409
<i>Which brings us to September 29,</i>

01:49.822 --> 01:51.604
<i>the night of the burger.</i>

01:51.723 --> 01:53.769
So, what do you guys
want to do for dinner?

01:53.889 --> 01:55.279
Oh, we just got a new cook.

01:55.399 --> 01:57.278
You have to try the burger,
it's amazing.

01:57.438 --> 01:59.903
- Great, we'll take five of those.
- Five burgers.

02:00.735 --> 02:03.357
- Really? You want to eat here?
- Yeah, I'm freaking starving.

02:03.476 --> 02:06.568
- I just finished a seven-day cleanse.
- I thought you started that yesterday.

02:06.728 --> 02:07.901
I finished early, OK?

02:08.722 --> 02:10.321
- Five of those.
- Five burgers.

02:10.735 --> 02:11.524
Wait.

02:11.684 --> 02:13.593
- What about sushi?
- We had sushi last night.

02:13.713 --> 02:15.315
- Italian.
- I had Italian for lunch.

02:15.475 --> 02:17.434
- I can come back.
- No. We always do this.

02:17.554 --> 02:19.398
We spend an hour arguing about
where to eat,

02:19.557 --> 02:20.898
and we end up here anyway.

02:21.057 --> 02:22.723
I haven't eaten for two days.

02:22.842 --> 02:26.473
Can we please, for the love of God,
just order something now?

02:29.056 --> 02:29.964
Chinese?

02:30.506 --> 02:32.394
- I don't like Chinese.
- Indian?

02:32.554 --> 02:34.436
I just said I don't like Chinese.

02:34.595 --> 02:35.724
Indian isn't Chinese.

02:35.973 --> 02:37.879
Weird meats, funny music,
side of rice.

02:37.998 --> 02:39.600
Why are we splitting hairs?

02:40.094 --> 02:40.893
Mexican?

02:41.393 --> 02:43.482
I just said I don't like Chinese.

02:43.865 --> 02:44.710
God.

02:58.669 --> 03:00.540
Robin, yours will be right out.

03:01.602 --> 03:03.136
Of course, mine comes last.

03:06.301 --> 03:07.720
Go ahead, start without me.

03:07.880 --> 03:10.219
Sweet! You shouldn't have.
That's so kind of you.

03:15.165 --> 03:16.050
My God.

03:16.458 --> 03:18.282
This burger is so good.

03:18.568 --> 03:20.432
It's like Christmas in my mouth,

03:20.552 --> 03:21.892
meat Christmas.

03:22.865 --> 03:24.731
It's like an angel from heaven

03:24.851 --> 03:27.067
landed in the kitchen at MacLaren's.

03:27.381 --> 03:30.380
Where the chef killed it and ran
it through the meat grinder.

03:30.777 --> 03:32.799
I love this burger so much,

03:32.919 --> 03:34.874
I want to sew my ass shut.

03:36.967 --> 03:37.795
It's okay.

03:37.955 --> 03:39.448
Are you kidding me?

03:39.568 --> 03:40.670
Guys, guys, guys.

03:40.830 --> 03:43.712
When you've had the best burger
in NY, every other burger

03:43.872 --> 03:45.461
tastes like my grandpa's feet.

03:45.812 --> 03:48.741
But you guys eat up,
enjoy my grandpa's feet.

03:49.162 --> 03:51.168
And you've had the
best burger in New York.

03:52.831 --> 03:56.219
It was eight years ago,
my first week in New York,

03:56.506 --> 03:59.958
and for a kid from Minnesota,
the big city was a scary place.

04:05.870 --> 04:07.330
Oh, thank God it's just you.

04:07.490 --> 04:09.373
You are being ridiculous.

04:09.532 --> 04:11.872
- {\Tell me}You left the apartment today?
- Why would I have to leave?

04:12.031 --> 04:14.996
I can have anything I want delivered,
and New York City cable is awesome.

04:15.156 --> 04:17.968
Have you seen this public access show
with the old Jewish lady in a bikini?

04:18.088 --> 04:19.273
It's disgusting.

04:19.392 --> 04:21.670
Marshall, you have to
get over this paranoia.

04:21.790 --> 04:24.306
- You are not gonna get mugged.
- What if I do, Ted

04:24.426 --> 04:27.293
I don't have a switchblade.
I don't know how to break-dance

04:27.412 --> 04:29.367
and win the begrudging respect
of a street gang.

04:29.526 --> 04:31.408
That's it, you're taking a walk.
Come on, go.

04:31.658 --> 04:33.503
No. Look, the old lady
in a bikini is back on.

04:33.624 --> 04:35.429
I'm just gonna lie back
and get comfortable.

04:35.549 --> 04:38.437
- Go outside, go, go.
- Okay.

04:42.313 --> 04:43.428
Leave the bat.

04:43.965 --> 04:44.772
Fine.

04:45.783 --> 04:48.379
So I went for a walk
in the big, scary city.

04:48.645 --> 04:51.976
And I discovered something amazing:
it wasn't scary at all.

04:52.096 --> 04:52.947
All right.

04:53.980 --> 04:55.278
What's the word?

04:56.483 --> 04:58.027
Your search is over!

04:58.296 --> 05:01.184
<i>And then, right when I started
to get a little hungry,</i>

05:01.480 --> 05:02.856
<i>I turned a corner...</i>

05:05.350 --> 05:06.756
And there it was.

05:07.081 --> 05:09.644
The tiniest little
burger joint you ever saw,

05:09.764 --> 05:12.524
tucked between a taxidermist
and a triple-X bookstore.

05:12.780 --> 05:15.107
Name two places
where things get stuffed.

05:17.033 --> 05:19.013
So, I went inside.

05:19.897 --> 05:22.160
And I ordered the burger.

05:23.342 --> 05:24.322
Thank you.

06:06.565 --> 06:08.137
Ted, you got to wake up.
Wake...

06:10.729 --> 06:11.761
Oh, my God.

06:11.881 --> 06:13.418
I'm so sorry. Are you okay?

06:13.538 --> 06:14.543
I'm all right.

06:16.666 --> 06:19.453
Ted, I've just had the most
amazing burger of my life!

06:19.572 --> 06:21.924
It's this awesome little place,
Regis Philbin eats there,

06:22.083 --> 06:24.631
so it's sort of like
a celebrity hot spot. But the burger,

06:25.294 --> 06:26.607
- The burger.
- Dude.

06:26.836 --> 06:28.631
I want one of those
burgers right now!

06:28.790 --> 06:30.768
- Do you think they're still open?
- I don't know.

06:30.888 --> 06:33.171
Does stuff in New York
stay open past... 9:30?

06:34.205 --> 06:35.920
So we went out
to get another burger.

06:36.181 --> 06:37.818
But after hours of searching...

06:37.938 --> 06:38.792
Damn it!

06:38.911 --> 06:40.087
Where is this place?

06:40.458 --> 06:42.597
- You couldn't find it?
- We didn't know our way around.

06:42.717 --> 06:44.909
Just getting back to the apartment
took us three hours

06:45.029 --> 06:48.217
- and one very helpful drag queen.
- Wait, Penny Noir was a drag queen?

06:50.114 --> 06:53.214
- Where do you think it was?
- Probably tucked between her legs.

06:55.157 --> 06:56.452
You know what's not a drag?

06:56.572 --> 06:58.739
Getting a home equity loan
at Goliath National Bank.

06:58.858 --> 06:59.826
I'm just saying.

07:00.122 --> 07:02.409
Anyways, we never found the place.

07:02.916 --> 07:04.968
Now, eight years
have passed, still...

07:06.392 --> 07:07.766
No burger.

07:09.667 --> 07:11.150
I couldn't help but overhear.

07:11.270 --> 07:12.911
Okay, here we go.

07:13.130 --> 07:15.337
- I know the place you're talking about.
- No, you don't.

07:15.764 --> 07:17.840
It's a place
called the Corner Bistro.

07:17.960 --> 07:19.383
Greatburger.

07:20.577 --> 07:22.571
Oh, the Corner Bistro!

07:23.370 --> 07:25.334
It's amazing, I spent
a quarter of my life

07:25.494 --> 07:28.333
searching for the best burger
in New York City, but silly me,

07:28.453 --> 07:30.288
it never occurred to me to check

07:30.409 --> 07:32.425
the highest-rated burger
in the Zagat guide.

07:32.635 --> 07:34.355
Wow, thanks a lot, guy.

07:34.475 --> 07:36.082
Let me return the favor.

07:36.289 --> 07:37.831
Great cup of coffee:

07:38.721 --> 07:39.732
Starbucks.

07:43.784 --> 07:46.162
So I take it you've
tried the Corner Bistro.

07:47.711 --> 07:49.928
I've tried every
so-called best burger

07:50.048 --> 07:52.137
in New York City
trying to find that burger.

07:53.556 --> 07:55.535
Or at least forget about her.

08:12.851 --> 08:14.092
We're going.

08:15.306 --> 08:17.288
But none of those places
even came close.

08:17.408 --> 08:20.333
There was that one time we thought
we had a break in the case, remember?

08:20.899 --> 08:21.771
Get this.

08:21.891 --> 08:24.770
- You know who works out at my gym?
- Regis Philbin.

08:25.016 --> 08:26.674
The autographed picture.

08:27.146 --> 08:28.570
Of course I remember the place.

08:28.854 --> 08:30.918
It was the best burger I ever had.

08:31.038 --> 08:33.501
I still have dreams
about this burger.

08:33.621 --> 08:35.652
Beautiful, haunting dreams!

08:36.118 --> 08:37.777
I wake up at night screaming,

08:37.937 --> 08:40.400
"Get out of my head, burger!
Get out!"

08:40.558 --> 08:41.900
That's the one, Mr. Philbin.

08:42.059 --> 08:44.691
- Do you rember where it is?
- No! I never wrote it down.

08:45.136 --> 08:48.523
But not a day goes by
that I don't regret it.

08:49.160 --> 08:50.773
Why? Why? Do you know where it is?

08:50.933 --> 08:52.217
- No.
- And if you tell me

08:52.336 --> 08:54.813
it's at the Corner Bistro, I'm gonna
smack you right in the face!

08:54.973 --> 08:57.034
- We don't know where it is.
- Listen, Blondie!

08:57.154 --> 08:58.745
Don't mess with me!

08:59.014 --> 09:00.771
Daddy needs his meat.

09:00.931 --> 09:03.449
I don't know where it is,
Regis, I swear!

09:04.138 --> 09:06.026
What about you, Lurch?

09:06.471 --> 09:08.590
And what about you, satchel-mouth?

09:09.720 --> 09:10.809
This is my cell.

09:11.350 --> 09:14.184
You find that burger,
you call me day or night.

09:14.344 --> 09:16.017
OK, Regis, we will, we will.

09:16.177 --> 09:18.267
What are you waiting for?
Get out and find the burger!

09:18.426 --> 09:20.449
- All right.
- Let's go, all of you!

09:21.834 --> 09:23.223
That's where my story ends.

09:23.809 --> 09:25.527
Now I'm doomed to walk the earth

09:25.647 --> 09:27.713
forever searching
for that green door

09:28.099 --> 09:30.722
and that red neon sign
that says "Burger."

09:30.881 --> 09:33.305
Green door, red neon sign
that says "Burger?"

09:33.464 --> 09:34.780
I know that place.

09:34.900 --> 09:38.124
I've walked by it a million times.
It's on West 12th, right off of 7th.

09:38.679 --> 09:40.720
I knew it was on a numbered street!

09:41.648 --> 09:43.524
- Finally.
- No! Robin!

09:43.644 --> 09:45.543
If any of us is gonna
eat a burger tonight,

09:45.663 --> 09:47.566
it's gonna be
the best burger in New York.

09:47.795 --> 09:49.468
We're going downtown!

09:49.998 --> 09:50.800
No...

09:56.639 --> 09:58.998
I cannot believe we're finally
gonna have this burger

09:59.360 --> 10:01.402
Honey, I'm so excited for you.

10:01.621 --> 10:04.456
After all these interviews,
after all these disappointments,

10:04.615 --> 10:07.288
you deserve a triumphant
mouth full of meat.

10:07.637 --> 10:09.408
You know what else is a mouthful?

10:09.947 --> 10:12.661
All that double-talk other banks
give you. At Goliath,

10:12.821 --> 10:15.411
customer satisfaction
is our most important investment.

10:15.571 --> 10:19.244
I hate to break this to you,
but working for a bank's kind of lame.

10:20.421 --> 10:23.071
How lame
is free automatic bill pay?

10:23.191 --> 10:26.144
How lame is 3.3% APY
online savings?

10:27.027 --> 10:30.057
That's right. Hate to make you
look stupid in front of your friends,

10:30.177 --> 10:31.844
but you left me no choice.

10:33.899 --> 10:35.961
- We should probably call Regis.
- Reg...

10:36.524 --> 10:39.529
That guy scares me.
I think I'll leave him a text.

10:39.689 --> 10:42.197
Now, Kathy,
your last flip was heads.

10:42.356 --> 10:45.028
The one before that was tails.
You polled the audience,

10:45.189 --> 10:48.368
they came out split, 50/50.
No help at all there.

10:48.896 --> 10:52.819
So, for $258,000...

10:54.145 --> 10:57.318
I have to ask you, Kathy,
what's it gonna be: heads...

10:58.518 --> 10:59.526
or...

11:00.759 --> 11:01.691
Excuse me.

11:02.809 --> 11:04.482
Oh, boy. I've got to go.

11:04.779 --> 11:06.105
I've got to go!

11:08.338 --> 11:10.583
Green door,
red neon sign. Guys,

11:11.420 --> 11:13.604
this is the place.
I've actually,

11:13.765 --> 11:16.062
- I prepared a few words.
- I will eat your hand.

11:16.223 --> 11:18.454
Let's just go inside then.
Shall we?

11:19.223 --> 11:21.851
- Thank you.
- Yours will be right out.

11:24.712 --> 11:26.269
Please, go ahead, start.

11:27.678 --> 11:30.060
- Just shut up and eat.
- All right.

11:32.942 --> 11:33.893
Oh, my God.

11:34.335 --> 11:36.397
I'm never brushing my teeth again

11:36.517 --> 11:38.849
unless it's with a toothbrush
made from this burger.

11:39.887 --> 11:42.467
I think I just had
my first burg-asm.

11:43.687 --> 11:44.719
I want...

11:45.439 --> 11:47.526
to take this burger out to dinner,

11:47.984 --> 11:49.432
then maybe a movie,

11:50.028 --> 11:51.726
then take it back to my place,

11:51.846 --> 11:53.646
put on a little
Terence Trent D'arby,

11:53.766 --> 11:55.428
and then I would just...

11:56.029 --> 11:57.516
fool around a little bit.

11:57.636 --> 11:59.803
Nothing serious,
just take it slow, you know?

12:00.919 --> 12:02.580
- This isn't it.
- What?

12:02.700 --> 12:04.052
It's not it.

12:04.212 --> 12:06.467
Marshall, you might not
want to hear this, but...

12:06.860 --> 12:09.828
is it at all possible this is the same
burger you had eight years ago,

12:09.948 --> 12:12.399
only it could never live up
to your ridiculously high expectations?

12:12.519 --> 12:15.317
- I mean, it is just a burger.
- Just a burger?

12:19.493 --> 12:22.097
It's so much more
than just a burger.

12:22.760 --> 12:23.768
I mean,

12:24.457 --> 12:25.746
that first bite...

12:26.356 --> 12:28.935
Oh, what heaven
that first bite is.

12:29.325 --> 12:31.712
The bun, like a sesame-freckled

12:32.084 --> 12:34.668
breast of an angel, resting gently

12:34.787 --> 12:36.979
on the ketchup
and mustard below. Flavors

12:37.099 --> 12:39.461
<i>mingling in a seductive pas de deux.</i>

12:40.216 --> 12:41.252
And then...

12:43.095 --> 12:44.101
a pickle

12:44.520 --> 12:45.611
the most...

12:45.952 --> 12:48.043
playful... little pickle,

12:48.364 --> 12:51.824
and then a slice of tomato,
a leaf of lettuce, and a...

12:52.247 --> 12:54.808
a patty... of ground beef, so...

12:56.098 --> 12:57.206
exquisite...

12:57.835 --> 12:59.331
swirling in your mouth,

12:59.491 --> 13:02.080
breaking apart
and combining again in a fugue

13:02.240 --> 13:04.313
of sweets and savories so...

13:05.698 --> 13:06.705
delightful.

13:07.464 --> 13:10.242
This is no mere sandwich
of grilled meat

13:10.536 --> 13:12.963
and toasted bread.
This is God...

13:14.085 --> 13:16.054
speaking to us through food.

13:18.611 --> 13:21.409
And you got our wedding vows
off the Internet.

13:23.159 --> 13:26.199
Okay, look, so, so this,
this isn't the place.

13:26.359 --> 13:29.638
All right, it's no big deal.
It's another place with a green door

13:29.758 --> 13:31.887
and a red neon sign
that says "Burger. "

13:32.007 --> 13:34.417
I'll just... I'll call
every restaurant in Manhattan

13:34.537 --> 13:36.717
and ask 'em
what color their door is.

13:37.524 --> 13:39.835
No big deal, right?
Let's do this.

13:44.526 --> 13:48.069
I'm going to go out on a limb here
and say this isn't just about a burger.

13:48.229 --> 13:50.306
Marshall's not doing
so well, guys.

13:50.426 --> 13:52.193
He really needs to get a job.

13:52.353 --> 13:55.359
- Tell them about the underpants.
- What about the underpants?

13:57.042 --> 13:58.942
It started a couple
of weeks ago.

13:59.804 --> 14:02.091
Heads!
It's going to be heads.

14:02.384 --> 14:04.108
It's almost usually heads.

14:05.161 --> 14:06.803
- Hey, baby.
- Hey!

14:08.177 --> 14:09.867
Did you put on pants today?

14:10.230 --> 14:11.232
Nope.

14:12.974 --> 14:16.521
It was funny at first,
but then it became a daily thing.

14:16.882 --> 14:19.812
I thought, "Okay, well, at least
he's not leaving the house like that. "

14:20.847 --> 14:23.687
Then, one day, he opened
the door to get the paper.

14:24.794 --> 14:27.925
Day after that,
went downstairs to get the mail.

14:28.955 --> 14:31.182
Everyone's got
an underpants radius.

14:31.614 --> 14:34.391
For most of us, it's the distance
from the bedroom to the bathroom,

14:35.142 --> 14:37.370
but as your self-esteem
gets smaller,

14:37.804 --> 14:39.889
your underpants radius gets bigger.

14:40.468 --> 14:43.016
How big is
Marshall's underpants radius?

14:44.523 --> 14:45.626
We're going.

14:51.796 --> 14:53.971
Come on, Lily,
he'll find a job eventually.

14:54.608 --> 14:56.496
You know, Lil,
when times are tough,

14:56.754 --> 14:59.298
I like to remember the uplifting words
of my favorite song.

14:59.984 --> 15:03.492
"We'll be on your side
when you need a friend

15:03.794 --> 15:07.631
"Through thick and thin
You can always depend

15:07.987 --> 15:13.002
"On the world leaders
In credit and banking

15:13.355 --> 15:17.036
"Goliath National Bank."

15:17.411 --> 15:18.525
Member FDIC.

15:20.005 --> 15:22.005
We've got to find
Marshall that burger.

15:22.165 --> 15:25.170
- I think we're all eating that burger.
- I'm not eating that burger.

15:25.330 --> 15:27.357
No, if Marshall says
this isn't the burger,

15:27.477 --> 15:28.586
this isn't it.

15:28.746 --> 15:30.375
- Finally.
- Excuse me.

15:30.495 --> 15:32.628
Did you guys change
cooks or something?

15:32.788 --> 15:36.669
Because my husband was here 5 years ago,
he's sure he had a different burger.

15:36.829 --> 15:38.986
Yeah, we get this a lot.
This place is modeled

15:39.106 --> 15:41.875
after this other place uptown with
the same green door and "Burger" sign.

15:42.034 --> 15:45.333
- What? Uptown? Where?
- 106th and Manhattan Avenue.

15:50.606 --> 15:51.615
Damn it.

15:52.322 --> 15:55.386
106. A numbered street. Of course.

15:58.323 --> 16:00.288
Barney, where the hell are you?

16:00.735 --> 16:02.579
I'm sorry, this is...?

16:02.739 --> 16:04.442
Regis. I'm at the place.

16:05.711 --> 16:09.555
Of course. I'm sorry, I forgot
to call you. That's not the place.

16:09.674 --> 16:11.650
The real place is on 106th
and Manhattan Avenue.

16:11.770 --> 16:14.782
- We're headed there right now.
- What? Uptown?

16:18.834 --> 16:21.058
Fine, fine, I'll be there in 20.

16:21.278 --> 16:22.789
If you get there first,

16:23.066 --> 16:24.764
- medium rare.
- Onions?

16:24.924 --> 16:27.263
- Onions?
- Okay, no onions.

16:27.423 --> 16:28.595
Stop the cab!

16:33.173 --> 16:34.183
Wait.

16:34.582 --> 16:35.661
This is it.

16:36.151 --> 16:37.634
Your search is over.

16:37.969 --> 16:40.315
We got girls taking
off their clothes.

16:40.435 --> 16:41.540
This is it.

16:51.705 --> 16:54.191
One of 9,000 convenient locations.

16:59.554 --> 17:02.061
It was ri...
it was right here. It was...

17:02.748 --> 17:04.208
it was right on this very spot.

17:04.435 --> 17:06.727
I don't understand.
Where is the burger place?

17:06.847 --> 17:09.816
It's not a burger place anymore,
it's a Goliath National Bank ATM.

17:09.977 --> 17:11.775
That's fine. Let's just eat here.

17:12.051 --> 17:14.233
We can't eat here. It's an ATM.

17:14.683 --> 17:16.113
But... food.

17:18.078 --> 17:19.726
What the...
This is your fault,

17:19.846 --> 17:21.397
you and your stupid bank.

17:21.518 --> 17:23.949
- You did this.
- It's not my... Stop, okay.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.241
Stop that, Lily.

17:25.515 --> 17:28.480
I will never use
a Goliath ATM ever again.

17:28.639 --> 17:30.889
Goliath National Bank sucks.

17:31.009 --> 17:33.644
It's the worst bank
on the face of the earth.

17:33.804 --> 17:36.906
Attention, New Yorkers,
this bank sucks!

17:37.025 --> 17:38.437
- They suck!
- Geez.

17:38.595 --> 17:41.318
- They suck, suck!
- Will you just tell her already?

17:41.553 --> 17:42.795
Tell me what?

17:44.574 --> 17:45.767
Tell me what?

17:46.349 --> 17:47.474
I got a job.

17:47.925 --> 17:49.142
What? Where?

17:50.306 --> 17:51.766
Goliath National Bank.

17:52.379 --> 17:55.001
That's why Barney's been going on
and on about how, how great Goliath is.

17:55.121 --> 17:58.306
He wanted you to be excited for me
since we will to working together.

17:58.466 --> 18:02.347
Well, technically not together.
You won't have access to my floor.

18:04.264 --> 18:06.679
But you want to be
an environmental lawyer.

18:06.839 --> 18:10.387
Yeah and I also want to be a Harlem
Globetrotter and get paid in candy, but

18:10.810 --> 18:12.079
in the meantime,

18:12.197 --> 18:15.102
I need a job, and this is,
this is a really good one.

18:15.384 --> 18:17.969
It's great pay and
there's good benefits,

18:18.859 --> 18:20.144
and to be honest,

18:20.941 --> 18:23.427
it gives me a reason to put
on pants in the morning.

18:23.686 --> 18:26.280
You know, I have my whole life
to save the planet, but right now

18:26.400 --> 18:28.842
I'm kind of really excited
to wear pants again.

18:29.409 --> 18:30.756
You've got great pants.

18:32.074 --> 18:34.032
- I love you.
- I love you.

18:36.414 --> 18:38.046
- They're unopened.
- Give it.

18:38.205 --> 18:39.839
- They're barbecue.
- Give it!

18:40.224 --> 18:42.255
I'm sorry you didn't get
your burger.

18:42.841 --> 18:45.605
It's stupid. I think about that
first week in New York.

18:45.725 --> 18:47.794
You know?
I was 22 years old.

18:48.363 --> 18:50.393
I had my whole future ahead of me.

18:50.849 --> 18:54.322
I guess I just kind of thought that if
I could have that burger one more time

18:55.214 --> 18:57.288
and feel that way
for one more night,

18:57.408 --> 18:59.455
that I might be able to
check that off the list,

18:59.575 --> 19:00.701
and grow up,

19:01.361 --> 19:04.362
go work for the stupid bank,
and just... be happy.

19:05.312 --> 19:08.539
You know, that burger place isn't gone.
It just moved to a new location.

19:09.991 --> 19:12.158
And I can tell you where that is
for a hundred bucks.

19:12.278 --> 19:14.328
A hundred bucks?
That's crazy.

19:16.394 --> 19:18.829
- Let's pay the man.
- I paid for the cab.

19:18.989 --> 19:21.286
- I have any cash.
- I haven't worked since March.

19:22.273 --> 19:24.814
If only there were an easy,
convenient way

19:24.934 --> 19:26.856
to get some cash right now.

19:36.172 --> 19:37.380
Member FDIC.

19:39.051 --> 19:41.599
<i>So we paid the guy,
and 20 minutes later...</i>

19:42.050 --> 19:43.141
Thank you.

19:43.399 --> 19:46.405
All right, Marshall, remember.
It might not taste as good.

19:46.565 --> 19:49.405
This place has changed,
you've changed, New York has changed.

19:49.564 --> 19:52.166
Just... don't get
your hopes up too high, okay?

20:02.747 --> 20:04.433
- This is it.
- Yes!

20:05.277 --> 20:06.837
It's exactly the same.

20:07.060 --> 20:08.900
It's the best burger in New York.

20:09.060 --> 20:10.705
Go ahead, eat up, eat up.

20:11.392 --> 20:14.482
<i>And so, after finally tasting again
the burger he'd craved</i>

20:14.642 --> 20:16.149
<i>for so many years,</i>

20:16.309 --> 20:19.272
<i>Marshall got up the next morning,
put on some pants,</i>

20:19.432 --> 20:20.686
<i>and went to work,</i>

20:21.151 --> 20:22.817
<i>and he never looked back.</i>

20:27.523 --> 20:30.723
I want to get tiny fitted sheets
for this burger, and just...

20:31.004 --> 20:32.773
crawl into this bun,

20:32.893 --> 20:35.040
get all cozy, and die there.

20:35.485 --> 20:36.862
Oh, my God.

20:36.982 --> 20:39.409
I just want you inside of me.

20:40.515 --> 20:42.181
This feels so good.

20:42.993 --> 20:45.447
I'm worried I'm gonna get
this burger pregnant.

20:45.860 --> 20:47.889
If he does get
that burger pregnant,

20:48.182 --> 20:50.661
I have dibs
on the delicious burger babies.

20:52.957 --> 20:54.733
- This isn't it.
- What?

20:55.494 --> 20:56.525
Come on.

20:56.645 --> 20:59.362
- That's outrageous.
- That is unbelievable.

21:00.804 --> 21:01.645
Wait.

21:01.764 --> 21:02.855
This is it!

21:04.665 --> 21:08.109
- You were just freakin' teasing us.
- No, really.
