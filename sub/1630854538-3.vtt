<i>Remind me
of the new kids' names.</i>

12:48.893 --> 12:50.394
Pretty young lady is Susan.

12:50.394 --> 12:52.438
<i>She's from George's
first marriage.</i>

12:52.438 --> 12:54.607
<i>The boys are Bryan and Jeff.
- His kids with Shirley?</i>

12:54.607 --> 12:55.775
George wanted them to meet

12:55.775 --> 12:57.610
<i>their new baby sister
before we leave.</i>

12:57.610 --> 12:59.403
<i>He surprised me with them
last night.</i>

12:59.403 --> 13:00.446
<i>That's a lot.</i>

13:02.072 --> 13:03.824
<i>You think, uh, you and Richey</i>

13:03.824 --> 13:05.201
<i>can handle all that
when we're gone?</i>

13:05.201 --> 13:07.328
<i>Course.</i>

13:07.328 --> 13:08.788
<i>Play the slots for me.</i>

13:10.623 --> 13:12.625
<i>Baby, I hit the jackpot
with you.</i>

13:12.625 --> 13:14.543
<i>Thank you.</i>

13:14.543 --> 13:17.797
<i>His blessed
face may be seen</i>

13:17.797 --> 13:20.049
<i>Nobody thought
he'd stay dry this long.</i>

13:20.049 --> 13:22.092
<i>I've never seen him happier.</i>

13:22.092 --> 13:23.636
<i>You're magic.</i>

13:23.636 --> 13:25.429
<i>No, there's no magic there.</i>

13:25.429 --> 13:27.973
<i>It's just, uh,
he's got a tell, see?</i>

13:27.973 --> 13:29.642
<i>Whenever he's fixing
to pull a drunk,</i>

13:29.642 --> 13:32.311
<i>he sucks on his teeth.</i>

13:32.311 --> 13:34.396
<i>So when I see that,</i>

13:34.396 --> 13:37.566
<i>well, I know
he needs a distraction.</i>

13:37.566 --> 13:40.402
<i>So I say, "Hey, Jones,
mow the lawn."</i>

13:40.402 --> 13:43.989
<i>"Come over here,
give me a kiss."</i>

13:43.989 --> 13:46.784
Must not my heart

13:46.784 --> 13:48.369
<i>From Him ever sever</i>

13:48.369 --> 13:50.621
<i>Beautiful.</i>

13:50.621 --> 13:53.290
He is my all

13:53.290 --> 13:57.127
<i>There's nothing between</i>

13:57.127 --> 13:59.839
Nothing between

13:59.839 --> 14:01.173
<i>My soul...</i>

14:02.967 --> 14:05.010
<i>My cat sings
better than you, boy.</i>

14:05.010 --> 14:06.595
<i>You must be the mailman's.</i>

14:06.595 --> 14:08.639
<i>He's teasing you.
You don't--you--</i>

14:08.639 --> 14:10.516
<i>baby, baby,
don't listen to him.</i>

14:10.516 --> 14:12.184
<i>He's teasing you.</i>

14:12.184 --> 14:15.354
<i>I'm not a singer. Is that okay?</i>

14:15.354 --> 14:17.731
<i>Yeah, yeah, that's okay.</i>

14:23.487 --> 14:26.782
<i>My daddy, he used
to come home so drunk.</i>

14:26.782 --> 14:28.826
<i>He'd drag me out of bed
and beat me</i>

14:28.826 --> 14:30.870
<i>until I sang for him.</i>

14:30.870 --> 14:32.121
<i>I'd be crying,</i>

14:32.121 --> 14:33.998
<i>and he was crying
for what he did to me,</i>

14:33.998 --> 14:38.210
<i>but my singing...</i>

14:38.210 --> 14:39.879
<i>made it better.</i>

14:41.422 --> 14:43.257
<i>At least for him.</i>

14:45.009 --> 14:46.427
<i>I'm sorry.</i>

14:49.555 --> 14:51.849
<i>He tore up the house
something awful.</i>

14:51.849 --> 14:54.351
<i>And I decided
I wasn't gonna sing for him,</i>

14:54.351 --> 14:56.520
<i>no matter how hard he cried.</i>

14:56.520 --> 14:57.897
<i>contemplative music</i>

14:57.897 --> 14:59.440
<i>I ran away.</i>

14:59.440 --> 15:02.902
<i>Lived for a spell
with my sister Helen</i>

15:02.902 --> 15:05.029
<i>and her husband, Dub.</i>

15:05.029 --> 15:08.324
<i>He was a cotton farmer.</i>

15:08.324 --> 15:11.994
<i>And he got me to helping them
pick the cotton.</i>

15:11.994 --> 15:15.039
<i>And that summer,
these grasshoppers came</i>

15:15.039 --> 15:17.708
<i>and they started eating
all the crops.</i>

15:17.708 --> 15:20.836
<i>Dub said, "Glenn,</i>

15:20.836 --> 15:23.547
<i>you're gonna go out there
and spread that poison."</i>

15:25.299 --> 15:29.595
<i>And I had this cart</i>

15:29.595 --> 15:31.931
<i>hooked up to a mule.</i>

15:31.931 --> 15:35.434
<i>I started fooling around,
and that mule bolted.</i>

15:35.434 --> 15:36.769
<i>No.
- Yeah.</i>

15:38.395 --> 15:40.272
<i>He was spilling
the poison everywhere</i>

15:40.272 --> 15:41.941
<i>and he was trampling
over the crops</i>

15:41.941 --> 15:45.194
<i>that hadn't been eaten yet, and...</i>

15:45.194 --> 15:47.446
<i>I just--</i>

15:47.446 --> 15:48.948
<i>I couldn't believe it.</i>

15:48.948 --> 15:53.452
<i>This whole beautiful field
was ruined because of me.</i>

15:55.454 --> 15:56.789
<i>I panic.</i>

15:56.789 --> 15:58.832
<i>I start running,
'cause I hear Dub hollering.</i>

15:58.832 --> 16:00.334
<i>I figure he's coming
to whoop me.</i>

16:00.334 --> 16:02.836
<i>And he caught up
to me real quick.</i>

16:02.836 --> 16:04.838
<i>And he comes right up to me.</i>

16:06.298 --> 16:08.884
<i>And he hug--</i>

16:08.884 --> 16:10.260
<i>hugged me.</i>

16:12.429 --> 16:14.974
<i>And he said, "It's okay, Glenn.</i>

16:14.974 --> 16:16.517
<i>It's okay."</i>

16:19.311 --> 16:20.938
<i>I like that story.</i>

16:20.938 --> 16:22.147
<i>Hmm.</i>

16:27.361 --> 16:29.488
<i>You make me feel like that.</i>

17:03.439 --> 17:04.773
<i>All right.</i>

17:07.109 --> 17:08.777
<i>Come here.</i>

17:15.909 --> 17:17.244
<i>Yeah?
- Yeah, don't stop.</i>

17:17.244 --> 17:18.871
<i>Okay.</i>

17:27.046 --> 17:28.839
<i>Whoa, whoa, whoa.</i>

17:28.839 --> 17:30.632
<i>Hold on, honey. What's wrong?</i>

17:30.632 --> 17:32.009
<i>No, I'm okay. I'm just gonna--</i>

17:32.009 --> 17:34.428
No, no, I just need a--

17:34.428 --> 17:36.055
<i>I'll be right back.</i>

17:41.852 --> 17:43.395
I'll be right out.

17:43.395 --> 17:44.938
<i>Honey, I'm sorry.</i>

17:46.940 --> 17:48.650
<i>What's going on?</i>

17:50.277 --> 17:52.446


17:54.406 --> 17:56.658
<i>I'm sorry, baby.
I'm sorry.</i>

17:56.658 --> 17:59.078
<i>I didn't want to worry you,
but, uh,</i>

17:59.078 --> 18:00.913
<i>the doctor says
that there's a problem.</i>

18:00.913 --> 18:01.997
<i>Problem?</i>

18:01.997 --> 18:04.041
<i>I didn't, um...</i>

18:04.041 --> 18:07.086
<i>I didn't take enough time off
after Georgette was born</i>

18:07.086 --> 18:09.129
<i>to heal, and I--</i>

18:09.129 --> 18:12.007
<i>God damn it, this damn business
is gonna kill us.</i>

18:12.007 --> 18:14.009
Nothing's gonna kill us.

18:14.009 --> 18:16.678
<i>Nothing's gonna kill us, honey. Nothing.</i>

18:16.678 --> 18:17.930
<i>Listen,
if it doesn't get better,</i>

18:17.930 --> 18:19.723
<i>I can have surgery.</i>

18:19.723 --> 18:23.811
<i>But that's what got me in
this mess in the first place.</i>

18:23.811 --> 18:25.229
<i>Plus, we have
all these commitments.</i>

18:25.229 --> 18:26.396
<i>And there's no time.
- Hey.</i>

18:26.396 --> 18:27.731
<i>Don't worry
about no commitments.</i>

18:29.608 --> 18:30.943
<i>The doctor's got me
on medicine.</i>

18:30.943 --> 18:32.361
<i>I'm already feeling better.</i>

18:32.361 --> 18:34.613
<i>Look, look, I'm good.</i>

18:40.285 --> 18:42.037
<i>Ah, sweet baby.</i>

18:42.037 --> 18:44.331
<i>Oh.</i>

18:50.504 --> 18:52.548
<i>The idea of anybody
cutting you up</i>

18:52.548 --> 18:54.299
<i>is more than I can handle.</i>

18:54.299 --> 18:55.509
<i>Mm.</i>

19:09.231 --> 19:11.650
<i>Jones isn't coming.</i>

19:15.988 --> 19:18.740
<i>Tammy's selling.</i>

19:18.740 --> 19:21.702
<i>Duets are selling.</i>

19:21.702 --> 19:23.954
<i>Jones' solo stuff
is flatlining.</i>

19:25.414 --> 19:27.332
<i>Nothing I've tried's
working on him.</i>

19:29.126 --> 19:31.962
<i>That is, when he actually
shows up to the studio.</i>

19:31.962 --> 19:33.463
<i>At least he's happy.</i>

19:34.840 --> 19:36.675
<i>Happy is the problem.</i>

19:37.968 --> 19:40.637
<i>Musically speaking.</i>

19:40.637 --> 19:44.516
<i>Fans prefer George drunk,
singing, "I'm Sorry."</i>

19:44.516 --> 19:47.352
<i>Happy at home
doesn't make hits.</i>

19:47.352 --> 19:50.147
<i>You want to call it?</i>

20:08.415 --> 20:10.542
<i>It looks nice, George.</i>

20:10.542 --> 20:13.378
<i>Can you see
the diamond pattern?</i>

20:13.378 --> 20:15.047
<i>I do not.</i>

20:15.047 --> 20:18.342
<i>Step back and get a better
overview, 'cause it's there.</i>

20:18.342 --> 20:19.718
<i>It is, yeah.</i>

20:19.718 --> 20:21.220
<i>You owe the label money</i>

20:21.220 --> 20:23.555
<i>for the musicians
you stood up today.</i>

20:23.555 --> 20:25.557
<i>And the studio time.</i>

20:25.557 --> 20:28.018
<i>A pretty big bill you're
running up with your no-shows.</i>

20:28.018 --> 20:29.853
<i>Yeah, it's fine.</i>

20:29.853 --> 20:33.232
Just gonna let Tammy pay, huh?

20:33.232 --> 20:35.901
<i>"Stand By Your Man"
paid for your lawn mower,</i>

20:35.901 --> 20:38.237
<i>'cause George Jones hasn't
had a solo number one...</i>

20:38.237 --> 20:40.739
<i>Since I started
listening to you.</i>

20:40.739 --> 20:42.532
Tammy's a rocket, Jones.

20:42.532 --> 20:44.409
<i>See, you're just along
for the ride.</i>

20:44.409 --> 20:46.787
<i>That's money left on the table.</i>

20:48.956 --> 20:51.208
<i>Well, the way I see it,
I've been shitting green</i>

20:51.208 --> 20:52.918
<i>for you people
my whole damn life,</i>

20:52.918 --> 20:56.380
<i>so, you know...</i>

20:56.380 --> 20:58.257
<i>I might have other priorities.</i>

20:59.967 --> 21:01.551
<i>You're taking the momentum
for granted.</i>

21:01.551 --> 21:03.428
<i>And you and I both know,
in this business,</i>

21:03.428 --> 21:04.763
<i>there's always someone
in your rearview mirror</i>

21:04.763 --> 21:06.640
<i>nipping at your tires.</i>

21:07.891 --> 21:10.269
<i>Keep your foot on the gas.</i>

21:11.937 --> 21:14.231
<i>Your feet are messing up
my diamond.</i>

21:16.942 --> 21:19.945
<i>mellow country music</i>

21:31.331 --> 21:33.625
<i>Oh, that's so pretty.</i>

21:40.966 --> 21:43.135
<i>Oh, look. It's real high.</i>

21:43.135 --> 21:45.679
<i>We could tease it there.
- I know.</i>

21:45.679 --> 21:48.265
<i>Well, it's always good
to have a nice base.</i>

21:48.265 --> 21:52.978


21:52.978 --> 21:55.188
<i>Well, yeah. I know.</i>

21:57.816 --> 22:00.527
<i>Sugar, what's--
what's wrong, baby?</i>

22:00.527 --> 22:03.572
<i>The fabric in this blazer
don't match the trousers.</i>

22:03.572 --> 22:05.574
<i>It's the same, sir.
- What?</i>

22:05.574 --> 22:07.659
<i>I think you look very handsome.</i>

22:10.537 --> 22:12.122
<i>Everything to your liking, Miss Wynette?</i>

22:12.122 --> 22:13.498
<i>Oh, it's perfect.</i>

22:13.498 --> 22:15.292
<i>Really. Everything's perfect.</i>

22:15.292 --> 22:16.668
<i>Right, honey?</i>

22:16.668 --> 22:18.670
<i>You can't pull a fast one
on me, son.</i>

22:18.670 --> 22:20.172
<i>This jacket's silk.</i>

22:20.172 --> 22:21.798
<i>The trousers are polyester.</i>

22:21.798 --> 22:23.258
<i>One's natural. The other isn't.</i>

22:23.258 --> 22:25.177
<i>The Possum knows
his fabrics, now.</i>

22:25.177 --> 22:27.637
<i>You can't play Vegas
if your fabrics don't match.</i>

22:27.637 --> 22:29.431
<i>That's right.
Thank you, Peanutt.</i>

22:29.431 --> 22:30.932
<i>Hell, everybody knows that, George.</i>

22:30.932 --> 22:32.851
<i>See? You need to get
your facts straight.</i>

22:35.479 --> 22:36.855
<i>And don't think I didn't notice</i>

22:36.855 --> 22:39.191
<i>that this lapel is silk,
but the binding's polyester.</i>

22:39.191 --> 22:40.567
<i>Honey...
- The binding is--</i>

22:40.567 --> 22:41.693
<i>Oh, look at this!</i>

22:41.693 --> 22:42.861
<i>He don't even know
what binding is.</i>

22:42.861 --> 22:44.321
<i>Let me tell you
what binding is.</i>

22:44.321 --> 22:45.697
<i>You know what kind
of tailor you are?</i>

22:45.697 --> 22:47.032
<i>You're the kind of tailor
that thinks</i>

22:47.032 --> 22:50.077
<i>you can mix unnatural fabrics
with the natural!</i>

22:52.913 --> 22:55.749
<i>Son of a bitch.
All right, all right.</i>

22:55.749 --> 22:59.419
<i>How can a man with hair
like that be a tailor?</i>

22:59.419 --> 23:01.296
<i>I gotta get into my coat.</i>

23:01.296 --> 23:02.631
<i>There's no need
to be nervous.</i>

23:02.631 --> 23:04.966
<i>I don't want to go.
They're gonna laugh at us.</i>

23:04.966 --> 23:06.426
<i>They're not gonna
laugh at us.</i>

23:06.426 --> 23:09.805
<i>$750,000 advance would be
a very expensive joke</i>

23:09.805 --> 23:11.098
<i>for them to play.</i>

23:11.098 --> 23:13.058
<i>They can put us
in front of an orchestra,</i>

23:13.058 --> 23:15.143
<i>but at the end of the day,
they're still just gonna think</i>

23:15.143 --> 23:17.229
<i>we're a couple of hillbillies.</i>

23:17.229 --> 23:18.897
<i>That's just your pride talking.</i>

23:20.774 --> 23:24.236
<i>Baby.
- I look like a damn √©clair.</i>

23:24.236 --> 23:25.904
<i>I'm not wearing these clothes.</i>

23:27.531 --> 23:29.408
<i>Then you don't
have to wear 'em.</i>

23:29.408 --> 23:31.034
<i>Okay?
- All right.</i>

23:31.034 --> 23:34.329
<i>Okay, we'll get you
something you like.</i>

23:34.329 --> 23:36.081
<i>All right.
- All right.</i>

23:37.541 --> 23:40.877
<i>You hang on me,
and I'll hang on to you.</i>

23:42.254 --> 23:43.672
<i>There you go.</i>

23:43.672 --> 23:45.924
<i>We'll get
through this together.</i>

23:45.924 --> 23:48.468
<i>We just got to hold on.</i>

23:48.468 --> 23:50.595
<i>That's right.
- Mm-hmm.</i>

23:50.595 --> 23:52.264
<i>You big baby.</i>

23:52.264 --> 23:54.307
Hold on.

24:01.440 --> 24:03.567
<i>Now...</i>

24:03.567 --> 24:05.652
<i>this is me.</i>

24:05.652 --> 24:08.113
<i>Positively a work of art, Manny.</i>

24:08.113 --> 24:09.948
<i>Damn, Jones,
you got more rhinestones on</i>

24:09.948 --> 24:12.451
<i>than Liberace.
- Hey, don't laugh.</i>

24:12.451 --> 24:14.494
<i>Wait till you see the jacket.
- Oh, yeah.</i>

24:14.494 --> 24:17.080
<i>Now, we got a plane to catch,
now, Manuel.</i>

24:17.080 --> 24:18.623
<i>You can't rush an artist.</i>

24:18.623 --> 24:20.417
<i>I love Las Vegas.</i>

24:20.417 --> 24:23.628

<i>Mm. Leave 'em.</i>

38:36.022 --> 38:40.109
<i>The lights are putting on
a show just for me.</i>

38:45.072 --> 38:48.075
<i>Isn't that nice of them?</i>

38:48.075 --> 38:49.368
<i>Yeah.</i>

39:16.687 --> 39:18.064
<i>Hey.
- Huh?</i>

39:18.064 --> 39:19.940
<i>Think you can
behave yourself now?</i>

39:27.615 --> 39:28.824
<i>Let's go.</i>

39:49.053 --> 39:51.680
<i>You like your flowers?</i>

39:51.680 --> 39:53.391
<i>None of these are from you.</i>

39:53.391 --> 39:55.351
<i>They sure are.
- Mm-mm.</i>

39:55.351 --> 39:57.186
<i>Those are from
the Nevada State senator.</i>

39:57.186 --> 39:58.854
<i>Those are from the label.</i>

39:58.854 --> 40:01.065
<i>Those right there
are from Mr. Sammy Davis Jr.</i>

40:01.065 --> 40:02.233
<i>That man's a talent.</i>

40:02.233 --> 40:04.568
<i>Mm-hmm. Wait a minute.</i>

40:04.568 --> 40:07.238
<i>One of these are from me.</i>

40:07.238 --> 40:08.656
<i>Which one, huh?</i>

40:10.199 --> 40:11.909
<i>Which one?
- The roses.</i>

40:11.909 --> 40:13.411
<i>The roses?
- Mm-hmm.</i>

40:16.080 --> 40:18.249
<i>All right, these?</i>

40:18.249 --> 40:19.917
<i>Yeah.
- Yeah.</i>

40:19.917 --> 40:21.502
<i>The roses.</i>

40:21.502 --> 40:23.587
<i>"Simply smashing.
Your fan, Burt Reynolds."</i>

40:24.588 --> 40:26.006
<i>Hmm.</i>

40:28.592 --> 40:30.302
<i>You gotta do my hair first.</i>

40:30.302 --> 40:34.306
<i>You do your own hair,
you son of a bitch.</i>

40:34.306 --> 40:36.392
<i>I told you
I didn't want to come.</i>

40:36.392 --> 40:37.935
<i>You promised me.</i>

40:37.935 --> 40:39.437
<i>But you knew I didn't want to--</i>

40:39.437 --> 40:41.272
<i>Are you listening to yourself?</i>

40:41.272 --> 40:42.898
<i>I got seven kids
at home counting on me.</i>

40:42.898 --> 40:44.275
<i>I don't need an eighth.</i>

40:45.651 --> 40:47.570
<i>I couldn't face it,
standing out there</i>

40:47.570 --> 40:49.113
<i>in some dumb monkey suit.</i>

40:49.113 --> 40:51.282
<i>I got you the suit you wanted.</i>

40:51.282 --> 40:53.909
<i>You're wearing it.
I got it for you.</i>

40:53.909 --> 40:55.911
<i>And look at you now,</i>

40:55.911 --> 40:58.122
<i>rolling in here
looking like hell.</i>

41:00.624 --> 41:03.752
<i>This thing that's just ours,</i>

41:03.752 --> 41:06.881
<i>it shouldn't be
for everybody else.</i>

41:06.881 --> 41:08.424
<i>When you're standing up there</i>

41:08.424 --> 41:10.426
<i>with everybody's eyes
crawling all over you,</i>

41:10.426 --> 41:11.886
<i>don't you feel it</i>

41:11.886 --> 41:14.930
<i>just eating away at everything
that's true?</i>

41:14.930 --> 41:17.057
<i>Mm-mm.</i>

41:17.057 --> 41:18.476
<i>No.</i>

41:20.019 --> 41:22.229
<i>All I felt was alone.</i>

41:25.524 --> 41:27.943
<i>You talk about how all those
people out there are dangerous</i>

41:27.943 --> 41:29.653
<i>and how all those people
out there,</i>

41:29.653 --> 41:31.739
<i>they're trying to cut us
into pieces.</i>

41:33.991 --> 41:36.202
<i>And if you believe that,
and I know you do,</i>

41:36.202 --> 41:37.995
<i>you leaving the way that--</i>

41:37.995 --> 41:39.747
<i>that you did...</i>

41:41.165 --> 41:43.417
<i>...you fed me to them.</i>

41:49.381 --> 41:52.343
<i>I just needed off the ride...</i>

41:52.343 --> 41:54.220
<i>for a minute.</i>

41:54.220 --> 41:57.181
<i>You can't bear happiness.</i>

42:00.309 --> 42:02.520
<i>Nobody wants me happy.</i>

42:04.980 --> 42:06.357
<i>I do.</i>

42:14.198 --> 42:16.408
<i>You look like hell.</i>

42:27.503 --> 42:29.797
<i>If you want me
to go out there with you,</i>

42:29.797 --> 42:32.258
<i>I'm gonna need
a few nips, okay?</i>

42:35.761 --> 42:37.388
<i>I understand.</i>

42:40.266 --> 42:42.184
<i>I ruined my suit.</i>

42:42.184 --> 42:43.936
<i>We'll figure it out.</i>

42:45.354 --> 42:47.106
<i>Who is it?</i>

42:47.106 --> 42:48.691
It's, uh--it's Peanutt.

42:48.691 --> 42:50.276
<i>I got something
I wanna play for y'all.</i>

42:50.276 --> 42:52.194
<i>No, it's not a good time.</i>

42:52.194 --> 42:53.654
<i>I'll be right there.</i>

42:55.739 --> 42:57.575
<i>Hey.
- Hey.</i>

42:57.575 --> 42:58.784
<i>I ain't disturbing anything,
am I?</i>

42:58.784 --> 42:59.910
<i>No.</i>

42:59.910 --> 43:01.579
Oh, we're just fighting.

43:01.579 --> 43:03.080
<i>Yeah?</i>

43:03.080 --> 43:05.416
<i>Well, if you fighting,
it means you still talking.</i>

43:09.503 --> 43:12.756
<i>It's a little rough, but...</i>

43:12.756 --> 43:15.926
<i>I think you'll get the--
the idea.</i>

43:17.511 --> 43:18.929
<i>Um...</i>

43:21.307 --> 43:23.934
<i>Something you said back home,
George, really inspired me.</i>

43:23.934 --> 43:25.352
<i>Okay.</i>

43:33.152 --> 43:38.115
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

43:39.783 --> 43:45.289
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

43:46.582 --> 43:52.421
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

43:52.421 --> 43:57.635
<i>To each other</i>

43:57.635 --> 44:00.971
<i>Life can be rough</i>

44:00.971 --> 44:04.308
<i>Sometimes it's kind</i>

44:04.308 --> 44:07.645
<i>A real good life</i>

44:07.645 --> 44:10.898
<i>Is hard to find</i>

44:10.898 --> 44:13.692
<i>But the best love</i>

44:13.692 --> 44:18.113
<i>Is the one we've known</i>

44:18.113 --> 44:20.866
<i>And the faith we have
between us</i>

44:20.866 --> 44:24.286
<i>Makes it grow</i>

44:24.286 --> 44:27.581
<i>Some love lives</i>

44:27.581 --> 44:30.626
<i>And some love don't</i>

44:30.626 --> 44:33.504
<i>But we've got the kind</i>

44:33.504 --> 44:36.632
<i>Of love we want</i>

44:36.632 --> 44:40.010
<i>It brings us happiness</i>

44:40.010 --> 44:42.513
<i>All through the day</i>

44:44.682 --> 44:48.811
<i>And nothing can ever
make it go away</i>

44:50.312 --> 44:55.192
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

44:56.694 --> 45:01.907
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

45:03.200 --> 45:08.747
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

45:08.747 --> 45:13.544
<i>To each other</i>

45:17.798 --> 45:20.592
<i>Time will tell</i>

45:20.592 --> 45:22.511
<i>If we're right or wrong</i>

45:23.929 --> 45:27.099
<i>We know we're right</i>

45:27.099 --> 45:29.393
<i>By holding on</i>

45:30.853 --> 45:33.647
<i>And the future is set</i>

45:33.647 --> 45:35.733
<i>For you and me</i>

45:37.276 --> 45:38.986
<i>Filled with love</i>

45:38.986 --> 45:42.030
<i>The way we both
want it to be</i>

45:43.866 --> 45:48.746
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

45:50.372 --> 45:55.085
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

<i>To each other</i>

46:08.015 --> 46:12.895
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

46:14.688 --> 46:19.568
<i>We're gonna hold on</i>

46:22.029 --> 46:24.156
<i>I brought you something
from home.</i>

46:24.156 --> 46:26.742
<i>Hold on</i>

46:26.742 --> 46:30.412
<i>To each other</i>

46:39.129 --> 46:41.965
<i>soft country music</i>

47:25.050 --> 47:26.802
<i>MTV</i>
