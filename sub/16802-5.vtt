WEBVTT

00:03.003 --> 00:04.879
AMY: Previously on "Heartland."

00:05.005 --> 00:06.256
 [groans]

00:06.381 --> 00:09.009
 What the-- [gasps]
Who was that guy?

00:09.134 --> 00:10.719
 You're actually a bronc rider?

00:10.844 --> 00:12.345
 That's right.

00:12.470 --> 00:14.389
And I am after buckles,
just not ones that belong

00:14.514 --> 00:16.265
to some two-bit cowboy wannabe.

00:16.391 --> 00:18.810
 Ty and I have something
that we want to tell you.

00:18.935 --> 00:23.481
 I've been seriously
considering going to Mongolia.

00:23.606 --> 00:24.607
 Mongolia?

00:24.733 --> 00:25.734
 Mongolia?

00:25.859 --> 00:27.110
 I fully intend to
come back and take

00:27.235 --> 00:28.653
my position in the clinic.

00:28.778 --> 00:29.946
 Your job and your partnership
will be here waiting

00:30.071 --> 00:32.031
for you when you get back.

00:32.156 --> 00:33.074
 Thanks, Scott.

00:33.199 --> 00:36.703
[music playing]

00:36.828 --> 00:37.746
ADAM: Georgie, hold up!

00:37.871 --> 00:38.705
GEORGIE: Fine!

00:42.334 --> 00:46.254
 [breathing heavily]

00:46.379 --> 00:49.132
 OK, turns out it's
not true what they say.

00:49.257 --> 00:50.550
Slow and steady
doesn't win the race.

00:50.675 --> 00:52.302
 Come on.
You were doing great.

00:52.427 --> 00:53.428
 I'm pretty sure
your five-year-old

00:53.553 --> 00:54.637
sister can run laps around me.

00:54.763 --> 00:56.097
 You just need a
little more practice.

00:56.222 --> 00:57.307
Come on.
I'll race you back.

00:57.432 --> 00:58.141
 Maybe you can let
me win just once?

00:58.266 --> 01:00.518
 [chuckles]

01:00.643 --> 01:01.436
 Guess not.

01:06.983 --> 01:08.443
 Hm, yeah.

01:08.568 --> 01:09.861
How long's your
layover in Beijing?

01:09.986 --> 01:10.987
 Hey, hey!

01:11.112 --> 01:12.364
They're going in the pie!

01:12.489 --> 01:14.115
 [chuckles] They're good.

01:14.240 --> 01:15.492
Lisa's aunt's
coming over tonight,

01:15.617 --> 01:17.202
so she's making a
whole lot of pie.

01:17.327 --> 01:20.455
 [chuckles] Looks like she's
going to open a bakery, Ty.

01:20.580 --> 01:21.498
 Ha, ha.

01:21.623 --> 01:22.582
 Here, how about
you guys say hi.

01:22.707 --> 01:23.458
 Hey, honey.

01:23.583 --> 01:24.542
 Now don't do anything stupid.

01:24.668 --> 01:25.418
 Travel safely.

01:25.543 --> 01:27.337
We miss you!

01:27.462 --> 01:29.089
 Did you get that?

01:29.214 --> 01:31.466
Aw, I love you too.

01:31.591 --> 01:33.593
I never thought I'd
say this, but call me

01:33.718 --> 01:35.637
as soon as you get to Mongolia.

01:35.762 --> 01:37.055
 Mongolia?

01:37.180 --> 01:38.264
What about Ty's clients?

01:38.390 --> 01:40.475
SCOTT: We'll figure it out.

01:40.600 --> 01:42.602
He's only gone for four months.

01:42.727 --> 01:44.229
 Four months!

01:44.354 --> 01:46.147
 Look on the bright side.

01:46.272 --> 01:50.735
It's a good excuse to
finally hire a new assistant.

01:50.860 --> 01:52.070
Here.

01:52.195 --> 01:53.738
Go through these resumes.

01:53.863 --> 01:56.157
Pick out four or five
that seem qualified

01:56.282 --> 01:59.411
and we'll go from there.

01:59.536 --> 02:01.329
OK, uh, Amy called.

02:01.454 --> 02:03.790
She has a horse she
wants you to look at.

02:03.915 --> 02:07.252
[music playing]

02:08.586 --> 02:09.920
 Hey, did you guys
have a good ride?

02:10.045 --> 02:11.506
 Everything hurts.

02:11.631 --> 02:13.508
Is it normal to be this sore?

02:13.633 --> 02:15.051
 Your muscles will
get used to that.

02:15.176 --> 02:16.177
 We're headed to
Maggie's later.

02:16.302 --> 02:17.429
Do you want to join us?

02:17.554 --> 02:18.972
 Uh, you know,
I should probably

02:19.097 --> 02:20.849
start working with a new
client horse that just came in.

02:20.974 --> 02:21.850
 This one here?

02:21.975 --> 02:23.601
 Yeah, his name's Lex.

02:23.727 --> 02:26.021
His owners say that he's
spooky and unpredictable.

02:26.146 --> 02:28.189
But they all say that.

02:28.314 --> 02:29.482
 Do you want me to
stay and help out?

02:29.607 --> 02:30.608
 That's OK.

02:30.734 --> 02:31.484
It's a pretty
standard game plan.

02:31.609 --> 02:32.986
I'm just going to lunge him.

02:33.111 --> 02:34.529
See if he responds to my
cues, that sort of thing.

02:34.654 --> 02:35.321
Thanks though.

02:35.447 --> 02:37.157
 You guys have fun.

02:37.282 --> 02:38.658
Come on.

02:38.783 --> 02:42.787
 So how come I've never
met your Aunt Evelyn?

02:42.912 --> 02:47.083
 Well, I actually haven't
seen her in a long time.

02:47.208 --> 02:48.877
She travels a lot.

02:49.002 --> 02:50.337
We used to be closer.

02:50.462 --> 02:53.340
She's sort of more of a
sister to me than an aunt.

02:53.465 --> 02:56.593
At times, I mean,
during my divorce

02:56.718 --> 03:00.138
I cried on her shoulder,
she fed me wine.

03:00.263 --> 03:04.184
I honestly don't know what I
would have done without her.

03:04.309 --> 03:06.978
I'm actually kind of excited
for you to meet her finally.

03:07.103 --> 03:08.396
 Me, too.

03:08.521 --> 03:09.898
 She's quite something.

03:10.023 --> 03:12.859
JACK: [chuckles]

03:12.984 --> 03:14.694
 Speaking of, there she is!

03:14.819 --> 03:17.655
JACK: For crying out loud,
she's three hours early!

03:17.781 --> 03:19.199
 Yes, she is.

03:19.324 --> 03:21.826
All right, let's go!

03:21.951 --> 03:22.911
 Oh, Lisa!

03:23.036 --> 03:23.870
[laughs]

03:23.995 --> 03:24.746
 Hi

03:24.871 --> 03:26.331
 Oh, oh!

03:26.456 --> 03:27.332
Oh, look at you.

03:27.457 --> 03:28.541
You're still so beautiful.

03:28.667 --> 03:29.668
You haven't changed one bit.

03:29.793 --> 03:30.835
 No, nor have you.

03:30.960 --> 03:31.670
 Oh, yes I have!

03:31.795 --> 03:33.713
LISA: No.

03:33.838 --> 03:34.589
 Ah!

03:34.714 --> 03:35.674
 Yes.

03:35.799 --> 03:36.966
 You must be Jack.

03:37.092 --> 03:38.468
[chuckling]

03:38.593 --> 03:40.512
Well, I've been dying to
meet the man who stole

03:40.637 --> 03:42.389
my favorite niece's heart.

03:42.514 --> 03:46.059
 Well, it is my pleasure
and welcome to Heartland.

03:46.184 --> 03:47.435
 Thank you.

03:47.560 --> 03:49.437
You know, it's
perfectly charming here.

03:49.562 --> 03:51.272
It's, you know, it's--

03:51.398 --> 03:53.441
smaller than I expected.

03:53.566 --> 03:54.651
Smaller than Fairfield.

03:54.776 --> 03:55.568
LISA: Well.

03:55.694 --> 03:57.028
 It is-- it is quite charming.

03:57.153 --> 03:59.114
And who might you be?

03:59.239 --> 04:00.073
 Katie!

04:00.198 --> 04:01.574
[chuckling]

04:01.700 --> 04:02.742
 Now that is a lovely name.

04:02.867 --> 04:04.285
You know something?

04:04.411 --> 04:07.455
Katie, I think I might have
something for you in the car.

04:07.580 --> 04:08.623
 You do?

04:08.748 --> 04:09.582
 I do.

04:09.708 --> 04:10.625
It's a kite.

04:10.750 --> 04:12.043
Thanks.

04:12.168 --> 04:15.672
I was just in Gujarat
and every year they

04:15.797 --> 04:17.966
celebrate the
festival of Uttarayan,

04:18.091 --> 04:20.301
where millions of people
gather to fly kites

04:20.427 --> 04:22.137
to celebrate the end of winter.

04:22.262 --> 04:25.515
It's one of the most magical
things I've ever seen.

04:25.640 --> 04:28.018
 [giggles] Can
we fly right now?

04:28.143 --> 04:30.437
 Well, let's just let Aunt
Evelyn settle in for a moment,

04:30.562 --> 04:31.855
shall we?
- But what do you say?

04:31.980 --> 04:33.023
 Thank you.

04:33.148 --> 04:35.275
 Oh, you are very,
very welcome, dear.

04:35.400 --> 04:36.234
 All right.

04:36.359 --> 04:37.569
You have to come inside.

04:37.694 --> 04:38.570
I have your favorite
cocktail brewing.

04:38.695 --> 04:40.113
- Ah, yes!
- Right now.

04:40.238 --> 04:41.823
 Can you help me, please, miss?

04:41.948 --> 04:43.408
Jack, be a dear and help the
driver bring in all the gifts

04:43.533 --> 04:44.325
that I brought, would you?

04:44.451 --> 04:45.744
Nothing is very heavy.

04:45.869 --> 04:48.329
So hopefully it won't
strain you too much.

04:48.455 --> 04:49.497
Thank you.

04:52.959 --> 04:56.463
[music playing]

05:03.261 --> 05:04.721
 That's it.

05:04.846 --> 05:07.098
Easy, whoa.

05:07.223 --> 05:08.600
Good boy, Lex.

05:08.725 --> 05:09.684
Good boy.

05:15.440 --> 05:16.149
[horse snorts and whinnies]

05:16.274 --> 05:17.776
Whoa, whoa!

05:17.901 --> 05:22.155
[grunts] Ah!

05:22.280 --> 05:23.365
Ah!

05:29.162 --> 05:32.999
[theme - jenn grant, "dreamer"]

05:43.885 --> 05:51.476
(SINGING) And at the break of
day, you sank into your dream.

05:51.601 --> 05:52.686
You dreamer.

05:55.480 --> 05:56.564
You dreamer.

05:59.442 --> 06:00.527
Dreamer.

06:09.661 --> 06:12.914
 [moans] Hey, Cass.

06:13.039 --> 06:13.873
 Hey.

06:18.545 --> 06:20.380
Scott said you had a horse you
wanted me to take a look at.

06:20.505 --> 06:21.423
 Yeah, Lex.

06:21.548 --> 06:22.716
He's in the back stalls here.

06:22.841 --> 06:24.009
Ow!

06:24.134 --> 06:24.926
 You're all right.

06:25.051 --> 06:26.094
 Yeah, I'm fine.

06:26.219 --> 06:27.762
 What happened?

06:27.887 --> 06:30.223
 Uh, Lex was so excited
to get out of the round pen

06:30.348 --> 06:31.891
he nearly ran me over.

06:32.017 --> 06:33.268
 Did you fall down?

06:33.393 --> 06:34.185
 Yeah.

06:34.310 --> 06:35.103
 How hard?

06:35.228 --> 06:36.479
 Not that hard.

06:36.604 --> 06:38.064
 Do you have any
cramping or bleeding?

06:38.189 --> 06:39.190
 Um, no.

06:39.315 --> 06:40.191
Why?

06:40.316 --> 06:41.651
Should I be concerned?

06:41.776 --> 06:43.278
 Well, the baby's well
protected in the womb,

06:43.403 --> 06:45.363
for the most part.

06:45.488 --> 06:46.281
I wouldn't worry about it.

06:46.406 --> 06:47.198
 [sighs] Too late.

06:47.323 --> 06:48.408
I'm worried.

06:48.533 --> 06:49.242
I'm going to call
my obstetrician.

06:49.367 --> 06:50.368
 I'm sorry.

06:50.493 --> 06:51.661
I didn't mean to freak you out.

06:51.786 --> 06:53.580
I mean, if I were
you, I'd be way more

06:53.705 --> 06:54.873
worried about your husband.

06:54.998 --> 06:57.375
I mean, Mongolia,
are you kidding me?

06:57.500 --> 06:58.418
 Yeah, hi.

06:58.543 --> 06:59.419
This is Amy Fleming.

06:59.544 --> 07:02.088
Is Dr. Adler there?

07:02.213 --> 07:03.965
 There's a hidden
marker in each circle.

07:04.090 --> 07:06.593
The teams use a series of clues
and a compass to find them.

07:06.718 --> 07:08.261
 So people actually
do this for fun?

07:08.386 --> 07:09.763
 Yeah.

07:09.888 --> 07:11.431
It's called competitive
mounted orienteering.

07:11.556 --> 07:12.474
There's a club
right here in Hudson

07:12.599 --> 07:13.975
that puts on events every month.

07:14.100 --> 07:16.436
I already signed us up.

07:16.561 --> 07:17.812
 Marion dragged me
to one of these things

07:17.937 --> 07:19.606
when we first started dating.

07:19.731 --> 07:21.149
Actually, it was kind of fun.

07:21.274 --> 07:22.734
 You see.

07:22.859 --> 07:25.904
 Yeah, well, we weren't
speaking by the end of it.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.822
 Georgie, can you take these
plates those guys in the back?

07:27.947 --> 07:29.282
 Oh, I'm not working
a shift today.

07:29.407 --> 07:30.825
 No, but Clay's
over there and I'd

07:30.950 --> 07:33.203
rather eat glass than
pretend to be civil to him.

07:33.328 --> 07:36.039
 Your job is to deliver
food to the customers.

07:36.164 --> 07:38.166
You and Clay are
competitors in the arena.

07:38.291 --> 07:39.250
This is a diner.

07:39.376 --> 07:42.295
Deliver food to the customers.

07:42.420 --> 07:46.508
 [sighs] All right.

07:46.633 --> 07:51.346
Three rib platters,
all the fixings.

07:51.471 --> 07:53.682
[sighs] Is there anything
else I can get you?

07:53.807 --> 07:54.474
 Nope.

07:54.599 --> 07:55.642
[chortling]

07:55.767 --> 07:57.060
 Is something funny?

07:57.185 --> 07:58.645
 Oh, we were just
admiring your outfit.

07:58.770 --> 08:00.146
It looks real nice.

08:00.271 --> 08:01.690
You should wear it
to practice sometime.

08:01.815 --> 08:02.941
 Yeah.

08:03.066 --> 08:03.858
 You could ride the
bronc sidesaddle.

08:03.983 --> 08:05.026
[laughing]

08:05.151 --> 08:06.403
Give us a twirl.

08:06.528 --> 08:07.362
 Don't choke on
your ribs, boys.

08:07.487 --> 08:08.363
[laughter]

08:08.488 --> 08:09.489
CLAY: Oh, hey, hold up.

08:09.614 --> 08:11.533
Can we get another
round of waters?

08:11.658 --> 08:12.909
We're out of ketchup.

08:13.034 --> 08:14.536
 There's plenty of
ketchup on the table.

08:14.661 --> 08:16.246
 Hm, it's empty.

08:16.371 --> 08:17.831
 Mm, no, it's not.

08:17.956 --> 08:20.959
 What happened to the
customer always being right?

08:21.084 --> 08:22.335
 You know what?

08:22.460 --> 08:25.005
Obviously, I'm mistaken.

08:25.130 --> 08:25.880
 Oh!

08:26.006 --> 08:29.217
What the-- ah!

08:29.342 --> 08:30.343
 You are right.

08:30.468 --> 08:31.845
It is empty.

08:31.970 --> 08:33.221
 Hey, you better come back
here and clean this up.

08:33.346 --> 08:34.222
 Clean it up yourself!

08:34.347 --> 08:35.472
 What's going on here?

08:35.597 --> 08:36.515
 I was just trying
to eat and Jade

08:36.640 --> 08:37.726
came over and lost it on me.

08:37.851 --> 08:39.184
 Oh, you know that's not true.

08:39.309 --> 08:42.397
 This is a diner, it's not
a high school, sit down.

08:42.522 --> 08:45.191
You get back to work.

08:45.316 --> 08:46.985
 [huffs]

08:47.110 --> 08:48.445
 What was that?

08:48.570 --> 08:51.740
 Clay's ego was
burning out of control.

08:51.865 --> 08:54.909
So I put it out with ketchup.

08:55.035 --> 08:56.995
 Do you ever think that
maybe your personality isn't

08:57.120 --> 08:58.747
suited to the service industry?

08:58.872 --> 09:01.041
 It's not my personality
that's the problem.

09:07.839 --> 09:10.800
 Well, what did
your doctor say?

09:10.925 --> 09:13.178
 Exactly what you did,
that I shouldn't worry.

09:13.303 --> 09:15.055
Only she was a little
bit more reassuring.

09:15.180 --> 09:17.807
 Better safe than sorry, right?

09:17.932 --> 09:19.893
And I'm sure Ty would
say the exact same thing

09:20.018 --> 09:23.646
if he were here and not
off saving gummy bears.

09:23.772 --> 09:24.939
 Gobi bears.

09:25.065 --> 09:26.232
 Yeah, I got it.

09:26.358 --> 09:27.776
Ty's saving the world.

09:27.901 --> 09:29.527
He's always had sort
of a Messiah complex.

09:29.652 --> 09:31.112
 A what?

09:31.237 --> 09:34.157
 He's just really into
helping people and animals.

09:34.282 --> 09:35.200
 Aren't you?

09:35.325 --> 09:36.868
 I'm a vet because
of the surgery.

09:36.993 --> 09:38.578
That's what I get off on.

09:38.703 --> 09:42.374
Helping pets and their owners
is more of a fringe benefit.

09:42.499 --> 09:44.417
Well, that's it for today.

09:44.542 --> 09:47.003
From what I can tell, it doesn't
look like Lex is suffering

09:47.128 --> 09:48.380
from any type of ailment.

09:48.505 --> 09:50.090
But I'll do a full blood
count and chemistry

09:50.215 --> 09:51.883
profile just to be sure.
- OK.

09:52.008 --> 09:53.134
 I'll call you when
I get the results.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.594
 Thanks.

09:54.719 --> 09:57.222
Cassandra, I hope
that you can at least

09:57.347 --> 09:59.057
try to be happy for Ty.

09:59.182 --> 10:01.768
I know that this Mongolia
thing came out of the blue,

10:01.893 --> 10:04.020
but it's really
important to him.

10:04.145 --> 10:07.315
 Look, if Ty has found
his bliss or whatever,

10:07.440 --> 10:08.733
then I am happy for him.

10:08.858 --> 10:09.984
I'm just not going to
pretend to be happy

10:10.110 --> 10:11.778
that my workload has doubled.

10:11.903 --> 10:14.781
Not that I'm complaining
or anything, but--

10:14.906 --> 10:16.658
well, I mean, I guess
I am complaining.

10:19.911 --> 10:21.454
EVELYN: I have traveled
all over the world,

10:21.579 --> 10:24.249
but nothing captured my
heart the way India did.

10:24.374 --> 10:27.752
The Ajanta caves and
the Khajuraho temples.

10:27.877 --> 10:32.132
And, of course,
oh, the Taj Mahal!

10:32.257 --> 10:35.301
 Aw, sounds like
an amazing trip.

10:35.427 --> 10:36.803
 What about you, Jack?

10:36.928 --> 10:38.304
Where do you like to travel?

10:38.430 --> 10:40.640
 The backfield, that's
about as far as Jack gets.

10:40.765 --> 10:42.726
 Wait, hey, that's--
that's not true.

10:42.851 --> 10:46.354
I've spent a few
winters in Arizona and--

10:46.479 --> 10:48.356
 And he's been to France once.

10:48.481 --> 10:50.692
Katie, will you please
finish your carrots.

10:50.817 --> 10:51.818
 Jack, you went to France?

10:51.943 --> 10:53.194
 Is was a while back.

10:53.319 --> 10:55.864
I prefer to stay close
to home these days.

10:55.989 --> 10:57.907
 You know, Lisa
loves to travel.

10:58.033 --> 10:59.951
I hope you're not keeping
my little bird in a cage.

11:00.076 --> 11:01.995
 No, I still travel plenty.

11:02.120 --> 11:04.873
Just not with Jack that often.

11:04.998 --> 11:09.085
 So not only do you
live in separate homes,

11:09.210 --> 11:11.338
you take separate
vacations as well?

11:11.463 --> 11:13.340
 Yeah, I guess it
sounds a little unusual,

11:13.465 --> 11:16.051
but it works for us.

11:16.176 --> 11:19.637
 So not spending any
time together at all,

11:19.763 --> 11:21.264
that-- that works for you?

11:21.389 --> 11:22.807
 I wouldn't say that we
don't spend any time together.

11:22.932 --> 11:24.517
 Lisa and I spend
plenty of quality--

11:24.642 --> 11:25.935
- Right
- --time--

11:26.061 --> 11:26.936
 Actually, I think
it's healthy to spend

11:27.062 --> 11:28.313
time apart from your spouse.

11:28.438 --> 11:29.731
Life takes us in
different directions

11:29.856 --> 11:31.274
and that's a good thing.

11:31.399 --> 11:32.233
Because then when you get
brought back together,

11:32.359 --> 11:33.193
you're that much closer.

11:36.780 --> 11:37.739
That's my opinion.

11:43.161 --> 11:45.455
LISA: Aunt Evelyn, this
is all too generous.

11:45.580 --> 11:46.915
 Nonsense.

11:47.040 --> 11:48.875
My passion for
traveling is second only

11:49.000 --> 11:51.044
to my passion for shopping.

11:51.169 --> 11:56.633
[laughs] And Jack, I have
something very special for you

11:56.758 --> 11:59.469
too.

11:59.594 --> 12:02.055
I picked it up in a little
market in New Delhi.

12:04.974 --> 12:08.269
 Well, I'll be!

12:08.395 --> 12:09.771
If it isn't a--

12:12.399 --> 12:13.692
uh, what is it?

12:13.817 --> 12:16.069
It's a traditional kurta!

12:16.194 --> 12:19.531
You know, there are so
many men in India that

12:19.656 --> 12:21.241
wear these all the time now.

12:21.366 --> 12:25.203
I know, a rancher
such as yourself

12:25.328 --> 12:26.955
would have much use
for it during the day.

12:27.080 --> 12:30.625
But it makes for a
lovely nightdress.

12:30.750 --> 12:32.210
 Mm-mm.

12:32.335 --> 12:34.713
Perfect for Jack.

12:34.838 --> 12:36.089
 All right.

12:36.214 --> 12:37.215
I'm going to make a
fresh pot of coffee.

12:37.340 --> 12:38.425
 Oh, well, why
don't I help you.

12:38.550 --> 12:39.342
 All right.

12:39.467 --> 12:40.760
 All right.

12:40.885 --> 12:41.720
 Thank you.

12:41.845 --> 12:43.513
 You're so welcome.

12:43.638 --> 12:47.142
[chuckling]

12:48.977 --> 12:51.271
 Adam, I gave
that place a call.

12:51.396 --> 12:53.106
The-- the one you were
talking about that

12:53.231 --> 12:54.566
offers orienteering courses.

12:54.691 --> 12:55.442
 You did?

12:55.567 --> 12:57.277
 Yeah.

12:57.402 --> 12:59.154
And it turns out that they have
of course built in Bear Creek

12:59.279 --> 13:01.865
that they're going to let my
rodeo school use tomorrow.

13:01.990 --> 13:04.242
 Why the sudden interest
in mounted orienteering?

13:04.367 --> 13:05.827
 Because I have some
students that could learn

13:05.952 --> 13:07.537
a thing or two about teamwork.

13:07.662 --> 13:09.414
 I know we're not in your
team, but do you think Georgie

13:09.539 --> 13:10.665
and I could enter?

13:10.790 --> 13:11.666
 Sure.

13:11.791 --> 13:12.834
Yeah, why not?

13:12.959 --> 13:14.210
 I don't know.

13:14.336 --> 13:15.420
I don't-- I'm OK with
the mounted part,

13:15.545 --> 13:16.963
but not orienteering.

13:17.088 --> 13:18.048
 That's why we're
the perfect team.

13:18.173 --> 13:19.049
 Come on, Georgie.

13:19.174 --> 13:20.467
You should totally do it.

13:20.592 --> 13:23.136
If I could ride, I'd be
there in a heartbeat.

13:23.261 --> 13:24.095
 OK.

13:24.220 --> 13:26.139
I guess it could be fun.

13:26.264 --> 13:27.974
 What about you, Jack?

13:28.099 --> 13:29.434
You want to come and
help out with the horses

13:29.559 --> 13:31.686
or do you want to
stay home and dance

13:31.811 --> 13:33.229
around in your new nightdress?

13:33.355 --> 13:36.232
 Yeah, your hilarious, Tim.

13:36.358 --> 13:38.485
 Do you know, I'm really
looking forward to having lunch

13:38.610 --> 13:39.903
tomorrow with you and Jack.

13:40.028 --> 13:43.114
 So are we.

13:43.239 --> 13:47.452
 Such a man of mystery isn't
he, that husband of yours.

13:47.577 --> 13:48.953
So stoic.

13:49.079 --> 13:54.167
 [chuckles] I guess
he's stoic at times.

13:54.292 --> 13:58.004
He's not much of a mystery
once you get to know him.

13:58.129 --> 13:59.339
 Oh.

13:59.464 --> 14:03.134
I can tell that Jack's
a man of principle--

14:03.259 --> 14:05.053
principle and great pride.

14:05.178 --> 14:07.972
Sort of explains your living
situation, doesn't it?

14:08.098 --> 14:09.933
 What do you mean?

14:10.058 --> 14:16.898
 Well-- you know,
like you, I had more

14:17.023 --> 14:18.858
money than my second husband.

14:18.983 --> 14:21.277
And he was very proud.

14:21.403 --> 14:22.946
You know he always
took it as an affront

14:23.071 --> 14:24.406
if I picked up a
check in a restaurant

14:24.531 --> 14:25.573
or paid for a vacation.

14:25.699 --> 14:29.494
Eventually, the love
turned into resentment.

14:29.619 --> 14:31.454
Of course, that was a
long, long time ago.

14:31.579 --> 14:35.250
We never even dreamed of
living in separate houses.

14:35.375 --> 14:37.335
Well, maybe that would have
saved the marriage or at least

14:37.460 --> 14:39.295
prolonged it giving
us the illusion

14:39.421 --> 14:40.463
that nothing had changed.

14:40.588 --> 14:46.678
That-- that money
wasn't an issue.

14:46.803 --> 14:49.723
 But Aunt Ev, that's not
why we don't live together.

14:49.848 --> 14:54.185
We-- we're just set in our ways.

14:54.310 --> 14:56.396
My money has never
been an issue for us.

14:56.521 --> 14:59.399
 After three failed
marriages of my own

14:59.524 --> 15:05.071
I can say with some authority
money is always an issue.

15:05.196 --> 15:09.784
You know, love's a
wonderful thing, Lisa.

15:09.909 --> 15:11.202
But Jack's not your equal.

15:11.327 --> 15:13.872
Not the way Dan was.

15:13.997 --> 15:15.457
I see trouble down the road.

15:18.335 --> 15:20.295
 Hey.

15:20.420 --> 15:23.423
 Just checking to see how
that coffee's coming along.

15:23.548 --> 15:25.258
 Coming along.

15:25.383 --> 15:26.593
Want me to bring you a cup?

15:26.718 --> 15:27.552
 Sure.

15:36.770 --> 15:39.564
[music playing]

15:39.689 --> 15:41.941
ADAM: Align the edge of the
compass with the starting

15:42.067 --> 15:43.651
and finishing point.

15:43.777 --> 15:47.155
And then just rotate the
compass until the arrow

15:47.280 --> 15:48.406
points north on the map.

15:48.531 --> 15:49.366
See?

15:49.491 --> 15:50.116
It's easy.

15:50.241 --> 15:51.576
 Easy for you.

15:51.701 --> 15:53.745
 Don't worry, you'll
get the hang of it.

15:53.870 --> 15:56.873
 [sighs] We really need to
get rid of that fanny pack.

15:56.998 --> 15:58.375
I get that need it
for your insulin,

15:58.500 --> 16:00.835
but it's really
inconvenient for riding.

16:00.960 --> 16:02.545
 Who's going to notice?

16:02.671 --> 16:03.505
 Hey, Adam?

16:03.630 --> 16:04.422
Your mom called.

16:04.547 --> 16:05.674
She wants a fanny pack back.

16:08.468 --> 16:10.011
TIM: All right, gather round.

16:12.681 --> 16:14.724
Jack, you want to
explain the rules?

16:14.849 --> 16:16.810
 No, thanks, Tim.

16:16.935 --> 16:19.270
 OK, I'll explain the rules.

16:19.396 --> 16:21.815
You will be divided
into teams of two.

16:21.940 --> 16:24.192
The object of the
game is to find

16:24.317 --> 16:26.528
the circled areas on the map.

16:26.653 --> 16:30.031
Using your compass and the
clues on the back of a map

16:30.156 --> 16:31.658
you'll find the hidden markers.

16:31.783 --> 16:33.326
 I have a question.

16:33.451 --> 16:36.496
 Wait till I'm finished and
then you can ask questions.

16:36.621 --> 16:37.372
Where was I?

16:37.497 --> 16:38.289
 Marker.

16:38.415 --> 16:39.541
 Markers.

16:39.666 --> 16:41.876
When you have
located the marker,

16:42.002 --> 16:43.670
it will have letters
written on it.

16:43.795 --> 16:46.214
Write the letters
down and then move on

16:46.339 --> 16:48.842
to the next circled
area on the map.

16:48.967 --> 16:50.218
You can do it in any order.

16:50.343 --> 16:51.302
Once you have located--

16:51.428 --> 16:52.387
 Can I just ask one thing?

16:52.512 --> 16:54.639
 Did you not hear what I said?

16:54.764 --> 16:58.601
Once you have located
all five markers,

16:58.727 --> 17:01.271
you race back to base
camp as fast as you can.

17:01.396 --> 17:04.566
The team with the
best time wins.

17:04.691 --> 17:06.358
Any questions?

17:06.483 --> 17:07.234
Anyone?

17:07.359 --> 17:07.986
 Yeah.

17:08.111 --> 17:09.570
Hello, over here.

17:09.695 --> 17:10.989
 Jade.

17:11.114 --> 17:12.281
 What does this have
to do with rodeo?

17:12.406 --> 17:14.284
 It has everything
to do with rodeo.

17:14.409 --> 17:16.536
The whole point of
the day is to learn

17:16.661 --> 17:20.623
how to combine horsemanship
with strategy and teamwork.

17:20.749 --> 17:23.877
Any more questions?

17:24.002 --> 17:25.795
OK, no more questions.

17:25.920 --> 17:27.088
Here are the teams.

17:27.213 --> 17:28.214
Chris and Evan.

17:28.339 --> 17:29.674
Mike and Daniel.

17:29.799 --> 17:31.009
Georgie and Adam.

17:31.134 --> 17:33.470
And Jade and Clay.

17:33.595 --> 17:34.429
 Uh, no way.

17:34.554 --> 17:35.138
JACK: Way!

17:35.263 --> 17:36.097
Mount up.

17:36.222 --> 17:37.599
Clock starts now.

17:37.724 --> 17:40.018
 Tim, there is no way
I'm working with him.

17:40.143 --> 17:40.852
 Clock's ticking.

17:40.977 --> 17:41.936
 But, Tim!

17:42.062 --> 17:43.480
 No, I don't want to hear it.

17:43.605 --> 17:46.649
You and Clay are partners.

17:46.775 --> 17:50.612
Tick, tick, tick--

17:50.737 --> 17:51.613
 Hey, partner.

17:51.738 --> 17:54.949
[music playing]

17:55.075 --> 17:58.453
[incoming call alert]

18:00.497 --> 18:01.373
 Ty, hey.

18:01.498 --> 18:03.291
 Hey, Amy, how are you?

18:03.416 --> 18:04.250
 Better than you.

18:04.376 --> 18:05.752
You look exhausted.

18:05.877 --> 18:08.588
 Yeah, well, it's
been a long trip.

18:08.713 --> 18:11.758
But, hey, listen, um, I got
a crazy message from Scott.

18:11.883 --> 18:13.885
Cass gave him an ultimatum
about the clinic.

18:14.010 --> 18:15.136
 What do you mean?

18:15.261 --> 18:16.304
 She's trying to get me fired.

18:22.352 --> 18:23.603
TY (ON VIDEO CALL):
Cass threatened

18:23.728 --> 18:25.522
to walk if Scott doesn't
make her a full partner.

18:25.647 --> 18:27.232
 I can't believe that
Scott would agree to that.

18:27.357 --> 18:28.274
TY (ON VIDEO CALL):
Yeah, well, we're

18:28.400 --> 18:29.693
short-staffed at the clinic.

18:29.818 --> 18:31.569
He can't afford to lose
her and she knows that.

18:31.695 --> 18:34.614
 OK, but can't he just offer
her an equal partnership?

18:34.739 --> 18:36.366
 We're not big enough to
have three partners, Amy.

18:36.491 --> 18:38.326
It makes more financial
sense for Scott

18:38.451 --> 18:40.620
to let me go and pick up Cass.

18:40.745 --> 18:42.664
 I can't believe that she
would do something like this.

18:42.789 --> 18:45.417
 Yeah, well, Cass has got to
do what she's got to do, right?

18:45.542 --> 18:46.668
 So what are you going to do?

18:46.793 --> 18:47.585
 I don't know.

18:47.711 --> 18:48.670
[hooting]

18:48.795 --> 18:50.505
Uh, Amy, I got to go.

18:50.630 --> 18:52.924
Rob and the driver
are waiting for me.

18:53.049 --> 18:54.676
I love you.

18:54.801 --> 18:55.593
 I love you too.

19:00.015 --> 19:02.142
CLAY: Who cares about
mounted orienteering.

19:02.267 --> 19:03.351
It's a beautiful day.

19:03.476 --> 19:05.478
We're out in the countryside.

19:05.603 --> 19:06.521
Let's take the
time to get to know

19:06.646 --> 19:07.939
each other a little bit better.

19:08.064 --> 19:09.441
 I know you think
you're pretty charming,

19:09.566 --> 19:11.109
but I got news for you.

19:11.234 --> 19:13.611
You have zero game.

19:13.737 --> 19:14.571
 I get it.

19:14.696 --> 19:16.239
You think you're
too good for me.

19:16.364 --> 19:19.743
Well, I got news for you, I've
dated plenty of college girls

19:19.868 --> 19:20.994
in my day.

19:21.119 --> 19:22.620
 Wow, what an accomplishment.

19:22.746 --> 19:24.330
ADAM: Keep your eyes peeled
for a white birch tree.

19:24.456 --> 19:27.709
GEORGIE: OK, got it.

19:27.834 --> 19:28.835
 Wait here for a second.

19:28.960 --> 19:29.711
I'll be right back.

19:35.592 --> 19:37.385
 Jade, what are you doing?

19:37.510 --> 19:38.762
 We need to have a girl talk.

19:38.887 --> 19:41.389
 You do realize this is
the timed event, right?

19:41.514 --> 19:42.974
 Yeah, it's really important.

19:43.099 --> 19:44.559
Please, Georgie?

19:44.684 --> 19:45.894
 Can you just give us a second?

19:49.356 --> 19:51.983
 Make it quick.

19:52.108 --> 19:53.276
 OK, what's going on?

19:53.401 --> 19:54.444
 There's no way I
can work with Clay.

19:54.569 --> 19:55.820
You have to switch
partners with me.

19:55.945 --> 19:56.821
 But why?

19:56.946 --> 19:58.490
 Because he's impossible.

19:58.615 --> 20:00.408
He's always hitting
on me and saying

20:00.533 --> 20:02.494
these gross sexist things.

20:02.619 --> 20:04.579
 Well, Tim's not just going
to let us switch partners.

20:04.704 --> 20:06.581
Don't you think he put you and
Clay together for a reason?

20:06.706 --> 20:08.541
 Yeah, he wants us to
declare a truce or whatever,

20:08.667 --> 20:11.294
but why should I be the one
to extend the olive branch?

20:11.419 --> 20:13.755
I'd rather stick that
bridge in my eye.

20:13.880 --> 20:14.714
You know, scratch that.

20:14.839 --> 20:16.424
I'd rather stick
it in Clay's eye.

20:16.549 --> 20:18.385
 Well, why don't you
and I just team up then.

20:18.510 --> 20:21.054
 Because if Clay partners with
Adam, they'll win for sure.

20:21.179 --> 20:22.681
Adam's a walking GPS.

20:22.806 --> 20:24.808
The whole point is
for me to beat Clay.

20:24.933 --> 20:27.018
 Well, if Clay and I team
up and you and Adam win,

20:27.143 --> 20:28.853
that means I lose.

20:28.978 --> 20:30.522
 So what?

20:30.647 --> 20:31.898
It's not like you're on
the rodeo team or anything.

20:32.023 --> 20:35.860
You have nothing to prove
to these guys, but I do.

20:35.985 --> 20:37.320
Please, Georgie?

20:37.445 --> 20:39.072
It's not like I ask you
for favors all the time.

20:39.197 --> 20:40.281
Please?

20:44.369 --> 20:46.454
 I think the first
marker is just up ahead.

20:46.579 --> 20:49.457
 Actually-- there's
been a change of plans.

20:51.876 --> 20:53.461
 All right, I can
handle the rest of this

20:53.586 --> 20:54.504
if you want to take off.

20:54.629 --> 20:57.340
 I'll stick around.

20:57.465 --> 20:59.718
 I thought you had to meet
Lisa and Aunt Evelyn for lunch?

20:59.843 --> 21:02.887
 Well, I did, but I
think you need me here.

21:03.013 --> 21:04.305
 No, I don't.

21:04.431 --> 21:05.890
 Well, too bad
because I'm staying.

21:06.016 --> 21:07.434
I already texted Lisa.

21:07.559 --> 21:09.352
 Well, text her back.

21:09.477 --> 21:10.478
You're free to go.

21:15.150 --> 21:17.068
Unless you're trying to
get out of it because

21:17.193 --> 21:20.405
of a certain Aunt Evelyn?

21:20.530 --> 21:23.033
[chuckles] Huh?

21:23.158 --> 21:24.659
Oh, what's the matter, Jack?

21:24.784 --> 21:27.662
Don't you want to hear some
more stories about India?

21:27.787 --> 21:30.123
Or was it her constant criticism
about your marriage to Lisa

21:30.248 --> 21:31.708
that turned you off?

21:31.833 --> 21:33.793
 I said I'm not going, and
that's all there is to it.

21:33.918 --> 21:35.253
 And how's Lisa going
to feel about you

21:35.378 --> 21:36.338
canceling at the last minute?

21:36.463 --> 21:37.297
 I don't know.

21:37.422 --> 21:38.715
She didn't respond.

21:38.840 --> 21:41.593
 Well, sometimes silence
is louder than words.

21:41.718 --> 21:44.471
 Trust me, it's for the best.

21:44.596 --> 21:48.016
[music playing]

21:52.520 --> 21:55.190
 Good boy.

21:55.315 --> 21:56.816
[clicks tongue]

21:56.941 --> 22:00.153
[horse snorting]

22:00.278 --> 22:02.113
[clicks tongue]

22:02.238 --> 22:03.031
Lex--

22:03.156 --> 22:03.990
[horse whinnies]

22:04.115 --> 22:04.824
settle.

22:04.949 --> 22:05.825
Hey!

22:05.950 --> 22:06.826
Lex!

22:09.579 --> 22:12.999
[horse whinnies shrilly]

22:13.750 --> 22:14.542
CASS: Amy?

22:17.379 --> 22:19.881
Amy?

22:20.006 --> 22:23.009
Amy, are you all right?

22:23.134 --> 22:24.678
 [sighs] Yeah, I'm fine.

22:24.803 --> 22:25.637
 You don't look fine.

22:25.762 --> 22:27.555
Maybe you should sit down.

22:27.681 --> 22:29.724
 You know, you have some
nerve showing up here.

22:29.849 --> 22:30.975
 What?

22:31.101 --> 22:32.143
 [scoffs] Don't pretend
like you don't know

22:32.268 --> 22:33.520
what I'm talking about.

22:33.645 --> 22:35.605
Ty told me you're
trying to get him fired.

22:35.730 --> 22:37.691
 I'm just here because I
have the test results for Lex.

22:37.816 --> 22:39.359
 Oh, I'm surprised
you're not too

22:39.484 --> 22:42.028
busy stabbing my husband in
the back to do actual vet work.

22:45.156 --> 22:47.075
 [sighs] Well, I thought
you'd like to know

22:47.200 --> 22:49.703
Lex has a clean bill of health.

22:49.828 --> 22:50.495
 Great.

22:50.620 --> 22:52.080
Now you can go.

22:52.205 --> 22:55.750
[music playing]

23:00.714 --> 23:02.173
 I can't believe Jade
won't suck it up for one day

23:02.298 --> 23:03.299
to be my partner.

23:03.425 --> 23:04.884
What's her problem?

23:05.010 --> 23:06.511
 The only reason she
doesn't want you as a partner

23:06.636 --> 23:08.888
is because you're
an unbearable jerk.

23:09.014 --> 23:10.974
I'd much rather be spending time
with my boyfriend right now.

23:11.099 --> 23:12.392
But, instead, I'm
stuck here with you.

23:12.517 --> 23:13.601
So don't think
this is fun for me.

23:13.727 --> 23:14.477
 Well, just because--

23:14.602 --> 23:16.021
 I'm not finished!

23:16.146 --> 23:17.439
If you really want
to win this, you're

23:17.564 --> 23:19.024
going to need me to cooperate.

23:19.149 --> 23:20.608
And I'm not about to spend
the rest of my day listening

23:20.734 --> 23:22.068
to you diss my friend.

23:22.193 --> 23:23.945
So one more word about
Jade and I'm done.

23:24.070 --> 23:24.946
Got it?

23:27.657 --> 23:28.950
 I'll start looking
for the next landmark.

23:34.164 --> 23:35.707
JADE: I hope you're not
mad at Georgie for agreeing

23:35.832 --> 23:37.500
to switch partners.

23:37.625 --> 23:40.670
Because if you're going to be
mad at anyone, it should be me.

23:40.795 --> 23:42.297
ADAM: I'm not mad.

23:42.422 --> 23:45.383
I just wish everyone
would take this seriously.

23:45.508 --> 23:46.426
I know it's just a game.

23:46.551 --> 23:48.803
I'd rather not come in last.

23:48.928 --> 23:50.263
 There's no way
we're coming in last.

23:50.388 --> 23:51.765
I plan on winning today.

23:51.890 --> 23:54.934
 Not if we can't find
this first marker.

23:55.060 --> 23:56.227
I've checked the
coordinates twice.

23:56.353 --> 23:57.145
It should be right here.

23:59.939 --> 24:02.317
 You mean this?

24:02.442 --> 24:03.485
 Yeah, that's it.

24:03.610 --> 24:04.569
 Why didn't you say anything?

24:04.694 --> 24:07.447
I saw it like five minutes ago.

24:07.572 --> 24:08.656
What?

24:11.785 --> 24:13.036
 I thought I told you to leave?

24:13.161 --> 24:14.913
 I'm only asking
Scott for what's fair.

24:15.038 --> 24:16.122
It's not personal.

24:16.247 --> 24:17.499
 You're trying to
get my husband fired.

24:17.624 --> 24:18.792
Trust me, it's personal.

24:18.917 --> 24:20.960
 I'm not trying
to get him fired.

24:21.086 --> 24:23.296
But I'm the one at the clinic
every day putting in the hours,

24:23.421 --> 24:24.756
picking up the extra slack.

24:24.881 --> 24:26.800
I deserve to be a partner
just as much as Ty.

24:26.925 --> 24:28.968
It's not my fault Scott
can't afford two partners.

24:29.094 --> 24:30.804
 Ty spent years paying
his dues with Scott.

24:30.929 --> 24:32.889
He earned that partnership.

24:33.014 --> 24:36.476
You can't just come in here and
take over the minute he leaves.

24:36.601 --> 24:37.852
 Amy, what's wrong?

24:37.977 --> 24:38.770
 I don't know.

24:38.895 --> 24:40.438
[groans] It really hurts.

24:40.563 --> 24:41.398
Something's wrong.

24:41.523 --> 24:42.357
 OK.

24:42.482 --> 24:44.150
Just take a deep breath.

24:44.275 --> 24:46.903
 [breathes heavily] What if
I hurt the baby when I fell?

24:47.028 --> 24:50.865
 No, some cramping is
normal during pregnancy.

24:50.990 --> 24:53.827
 [groans] No, it really hurts.

24:53.952 --> 24:54.786
This is all my fault.

24:54.911 --> 24:57.831
CASS: OK, Amy, look at me?

24:57.956 --> 25:00.125
This is not your fault.
You're just having

25:00.250 --> 25:02.836
some cramping, that's all.

25:02.961 --> 25:04.421
Come on, I'm going to
take you to the hospital.

25:04.546 --> 25:05.630
OK?

25:14.097 --> 25:17.559
[music playing]

25:20.979 --> 25:23.314
 Whoa, I think
we should go left.

25:23.440 --> 25:25.358
 Look, it'll be way
faster to go right.

25:25.483 --> 25:27.152
 Yeah, but then we'll have
to backtrack at the end

25:27.277 --> 25:28.862
to get the last two markers.
- So what?

25:28.987 --> 25:29.904
We won't lose that much time.

25:30.030 --> 25:31.448
We'll just make it up to speed.

25:31.573 --> 25:33.533
That is if you can keep up.

25:33.658 --> 25:34.492
 Hold still.

25:34.617 --> 25:35.910
 Why, what is it?

25:36.036 --> 25:37.245
- You have a spider on you.
- Oh, my God!

25:37.370 --> 25:38.329
Just get it off!

25:38.455 --> 25:40.415
Get it off!

25:40.540 --> 25:42.751
 It's off, calm down!

25:42.876 --> 25:44.294
- You sure?
- Yes!

25:44.419 --> 25:45.837
You don't have to be
such a big baby about it.

25:45.962 --> 25:46.921
 I can's stand spiders.

25:47.047 --> 25:49.257
Just get it off.

25:49.382 --> 25:51.801
A lot of people are
scared of spiders, OK?

25:51.926 --> 25:54.387
 Yeah, including cowboys
with oversized egos who think

25:54.512 --> 25:56.181
they know everything.

25:56.306 --> 25:57.515
 OK, fine.

25:57.640 --> 25:58.391
We'll go your way.

25:58.516 --> 25:59.392
 OK.

25:59.517 --> 26:00.685
Now try to keep up.

26:00.810 --> 26:03.021
 [clicks tongue]

26:03.146 --> 26:05.231
 [sighs] It's a shame
that Jack couldn't join us.

26:05.357 --> 26:07.025
 Mm.

26:07.150 --> 26:09.903
 Now I was going to try and
talk him into letting you

26:10.028 --> 26:11.780
go on a little trip with me.

26:11.905 --> 26:13.073
 Where?

26:13.198 --> 26:14.783
 To Morocco.

26:14.908 --> 26:16.576
We could leave in a
few days if you like.

26:16.701 --> 26:18.119
 No, I can't on
such short notice.

26:18.244 --> 26:19.579
 What?

26:19.704 --> 26:21.414
An impromptu trip to Morocco
isn't the craziest idea

26:21.539 --> 26:22.290
in the world, is it?

26:22.415 --> 26:23.958
We've done it before.

26:24.084 --> 26:27.045
 I know, but I have
responsibilities now.

26:27.170 --> 26:30.090
I have a business
and Katie, I can't.

26:30.215 --> 26:31.925
 Katie is your husband's
great-granddaughter.

26:32.050 --> 26:36.221
She's hardly your
responsibility.

26:36.346 --> 26:41.935
Lisa-- I just keep thinking
there's so much more you could

26:42.060 --> 26:43.395
be doing with your
life instead of being

26:43.520 --> 26:45.146
a glorified babysitter.

26:45.271 --> 26:49.067
Is that really what you signed
up for when you married Jack?

26:49.192 --> 26:51.486
I just wonder are you happy?

26:51.611 --> 26:53.196
 I am.

26:53.321 --> 26:57.283
Auntie, I really am.

26:57.409 --> 26:59.744
And I'm hungry.

26:59.869 --> 27:03.331
Let's-- let's order
some lunch, shall we?

27:03.456 --> 27:06.835
[music playing]

27:08.545 --> 27:10.630
 Do you need anything
else before I go?

27:10.755 --> 27:11.589
 No, thanks.

27:11.715 --> 27:13.133
I should be good.

27:13.258 --> 27:16.261
I'm sorry I freaked out earlier.

27:16.386 --> 27:18.513
 You had every right
to be freaked out.

27:18.638 --> 27:21.266
 It used to be just me and
a horse in the round pen.

27:21.391 --> 27:22.475
But now--

27:22.600 --> 27:24.978
 You have a baby
to think about.

27:25.103 --> 27:28.023
 I've worked with hundreds
of horses just like Lex.

27:28.148 --> 27:30.817
So how come every time I
close my eyes all I can see

27:30.942 --> 27:32.569
is him charging me?

27:32.694 --> 27:34.821
 Well, you heard
what the doctor said.

27:34.946 --> 27:36.489
It was just Braxton
Hicks contractions,

27:36.614 --> 27:39.075
totally normal at this
stage in your pregnancy.

27:39.200 --> 27:41.036
It had nothing to
do with your fall.

27:41.161 --> 27:42.162
 I know.

27:42.287 --> 27:43.496
[sighs] I don't
know what I would

27:43.621 --> 27:46.332
have done if you weren't here.

27:46.458 --> 27:47.792
 Don't worry about it.

27:47.917 --> 27:49.044
But get some rest.

27:49.169 --> 27:50.545
Doctor's orders.

27:50.670 --> 27:52.714
 Cass?

27:52.839 --> 27:55.467
It is personal.

27:55.592 --> 27:57.302
 What?

27:57.427 --> 27:59.679
 What you're doing to Ty.

27:59.804 --> 28:01.139
I know you think
that there should

28:01.264 --> 28:03.183
be some kind of separation
between what's personal

28:03.308 --> 28:04.976
and what's business.

28:05.101 --> 28:06.770
I don't think it can
ever be like that.

28:06.895 --> 28:09.064
Not with us.

28:09.189 --> 28:10.940
I'm Ty's wife.

28:11.066 --> 28:15.153
And you're his
work-wife and my friend.

28:15.278 --> 28:19.491
It's just-- it's really messy.

28:19.616 --> 28:21.576
 I just want what's fair.

28:21.701 --> 28:24.079
I don't want to hurt you or Ty.

28:26.498 --> 28:27.415
 Then don't.

28:31.503 --> 28:34.881
[music playing]

28:35.006 --> 28:36.341
 OK.

28:36.466 --> 28:40.095
So the marker is 140 degrees
from this steel drum.

28:47.102 --> 28:48.770
 Yeah, 230 degrees
from this tripod.

28:53.066 --> 28:54.859
That makes it
somewhere over here.

28:58.029 --> 28:58.988
 Do you see it?

28:59.114 --> 29:00.699
 No.

29:00.824 --> 29:01.908
 Did you read
your compass right?

29:02.033 --> 29:03.034
 Of course, I read
my compass right.

29:03.159 --> 29:05.453
It's around here somewhere.

29:05.578 --> 29:07.831
 Look.

29:07.956 --> 29:09.874
 You see, I told
you it was over here.

29:10.000 --> 29:11.793
 We're making pretty good time.

29:11.918 --> 29:13.211
We've only got
three markers left.

29:13.336 --> 29:14.504
Why don't we go get
five and then get

29:14.629 --> 29:16.339
three and four on the way back?
- Sounds good.

29:16.464 --> 29:17.215
Let's do it.

29:17.340 --> 29:18.633
 We might actually win this.

29:18.758 --> 29:20.260
 Don't sound so surprised.

29:20.385 --> 29:23.888
[music playing]

29:32.772 --> 29:33.815
 It's that way.

29:46.327 --> 29:47.996
 You know, Jack, I got
some experience dealing

29:48.121 --> 29:49.914
with difficult relatives.

29:50.040 --> 29:52.667
In fact, I got an
ex-father-in-law, who

29:52.792 --> 29:54.002
can be a real pain in the butt.

29:59.049 --> 30:00.675
Would you lighten up?

30:00.800 --> 30:01.593
Come on.

30:01.718 --> 30:03.887
Evelyn's harmless.

30:04.012 --> 30:06.097
I-- I don't see why you
can't suffer through one

30:06.222 --> 30:07.307
more lunch with her.

30:07.432 --> 30:11.186
 Because-- I
overheard her saying

30:11.311 --> 30:13.021
something to Lisa last night.

30:13.146 --> 30:14.773
 What?

30:14.898 --> 30:18.276
 She was shooting her mouth
off about how Lisa's rich

30:18.401 --> 30:20.320
and I'm not and all
the trouble that's

30:20.445 --> 30:21.446
going to cause down the road.

30:21.571 --> 30:22.947
 So what?

30:23.073 --> 30:24.699
She's got some old-fashioned
ideas about money.

30:24.824 --> 30:25.950
It's not the end of the world.

30:26.076 --> 30:27.577
 If I show up there
today, believe me,

30:27.702 --> 30:30.163
I will not be able to
stop myself from telling

30:30.288 --> 30:31.873
Evelyn where she can go.

30:31.998 --> 30:33.708
 Well, if you
tell her off, yeah,

30:33.833 --> 30:37.170
that's definitely a bad idea.

30:37.295 --> 30:39.089
But you not showing up,
that might even be worse.

30:39.214 --> 30:40.382
 Well, what am
I supposed to do?

30:40.507 --> 30:41.800
Just sit there?

30:41.925 --> 30:45.720
Not say a word while she's
looking down her nose at me?

30:45.845 --> 30:48.473
 It's what I always did.

30:48.598 --> 30:53.228
Husbands have been doing that
with in-laws for centuries.

30:53.353 --> 30:56.398
You used to look
down your nose at me.

30:56.523 --> 30:58.024
But I always showed
up for those dinners.

30:58.149 --> 30:59.275
 It's not the same.

30:59.401 --> 31:03.446
 It's exactly the
same thing, Jack.

31:03.571 --> 31:05.865
That's how I gained
Marion's respect--

31:05.990 --> 31:09.536
always showing up
for the dinners.

31:09.661 --> 31:11.246
And more importantly,
it pissed you off.

31:15.125 --> 31:17.877
If you leave now, you'll
make it for dessert.

31:18.003 --> 31:21.506
[music playing]

31:39.482 --> 31:41.943
 [sighs]

31:59.377 --> 32:01.921
[sighs]

32:03.381 --> 32:04.966
OK.

32:05.091 --> 32:06.134
Let's start again.

32:11.514 --> 32:14.976
[music playing]

32:27.197 --> 32:28.281
 Thought you weren't
going to make it?

32:28.406 --> 32:31.659
 Oh, I pushed off
a little early.

32:31.785 --> 32:33.286
Good to see you, Evelyn.

32:33.411 --> 32:37.248
 Better late than
never I suppose.

32:37.374 --> 32:39.000
You know, I've been trying
to convince my niece

32:39.125 --> 32:40.502
to go on a little trip with me.

32:40.627 --> 32:42.587
 Hm, where to?

32:42.712 --> 32:44.464
 Morocco.

32:44.589 --> 32:46.174
There's so much
culture over there

32:46.299 --> 32:50.887
and architecture and
the food is to die for.

32:51.012 --> 32:54.099
Of course, you would absolutely
hate it over there Jack.

32:54.224 --> 32:55.183
Wouldn't he, Lisa?

32:59.312 --> 33:01.940
 So when would that be?

33:02.065 --> 33:06.236
 Well, I was hoping in a
few days, but, apparently--

33:06.361 --> 33:10.824
Lisa's too busy babysitting
Katie to come along.

33:10.949 --> 33:11.825
 I don't call it babysitting.

33:11.950 --> 33:13.243
EVELYN: Well, I do.

33:13.368 --> 33:15.036
Her parents seem to have
absolutely no interest

33:15.161 --> 33:16.371
in raising the child
and you have been left

33:16.496 --> 33:19.833
to pick up the parental slack.

33:19.958 --> 33:26.214
 Evelyn, what's-- this
is none of your business.

33:28.925 --> 33:30.135
 Excuse me?

33:32.762 --> 33:34.514
 I'm done.

33:34.639 --> 33:36.474
I can't sit here another
second and listen

33:36.599 --> 33:38.476
to you diminish the choices
I've made for myself.

33:41.021 --> 33:42.939
Heartland is my home.

33:43.064 --> 33:46.943
I don't drop in and buy a
gift at the souvenir shop

33:47.068 --> 33:48.737
like you do in
India and Morocco.

33:48.862 --> 33:49.738
 Huh.

33:49.863 --> 33:51.406
 I've chosen it.

33:51.531 --> 33:52.449
This is my life.

33:52.574 --> 33:54.451
 Yes, I know it's your life.

33:54.576 --> 33:58.455
 Why do you feel that you
have the right to judge it?

33:58.580 --> 34:02.375
How dare you call me a
glorified babysitter.

34:02.500 --> 34:03.877
Katie may not be
my flesh and blood,

34:04.002 --> 34:07.422
but she as much family
to me now as you are.

34:07.547 --> 34:10.759
You asked me before
if I'm happy.

34:10.884 --> 34:13.428
Let me be very clear.

34:13.553 --> 34:17.431
Yes, I'm happy.

34:17.556 --> 34:20.101
I think the bigger question
right now is, are you?

34:26.024 --> 34:28.650
I'm sorry, I need some air.

34:28.777 --> 34:29.610
Excuse us.

34:52.550 --> 34:56.429
 So what just
happened in there?

34:56.554 --> 34:58.807
 [sighs]

35:00.308 --> 35:01.393
I told my aunt off.

35:04.145 --> 35:05.271
And I'm really glad I did.

35:08.858 --> 35:12.529
I love our life together.

35:12.654 --> 35:13.947
I'm happy.

35:14.072 --> 35:15.156
 I love you.

35:20.453 --> 35:25.166
 [clicks tongue] Get up.

35:25.291 --> 35:29.629
[clicks tongue]

35:29.754 --> 35:30.588
Get up, come on.

35:34.259 --> 35:35.927
Come on, Lex.

35:36.052 --> 35:39.014
That's it.

35:39.139 --> 35:40.682
[clicks tongue]

35:40.807 --> 35:41.683
Good.

35:49.566 --> 35:54.904
[sighs] You're a
good boy, Lex, hey?

35:55.030 --> 35:57.157
That's a good boy.

35:57.282 --> 36:01.202
 Scott, for the record, I'm
not trying to get Ty fired.

36:01.327 --> 36:02.871
Well, at least it's
not my intention.

36:02.996 --> 36:04.414
 I can't afford two partners.

36:04.539 --> 36:06.916
So you're putting me in
a difficult position.

36:07.042 --> 36:10.962
 I know, but you can't expect
me to do Ty's share of the work

36:11.087 --> 36:13.214
without making some changes.

36:13.340 --> 36:17.344
 [sighs] I can't
make you a partner.

36:17.469 --> 36:19.220
 OK.

36:19.346 --> 36:22.766
Well, what can you do?

36:22.891 --> 36:24.809
 [sighs] OK.

36:27.729 --> 36:30.815
I will hire two assistants
instead of just one

36:30.940 --> 36:32.817
that'll help the workload.

36:32.942 --> 36:35.570
And, um, we can
talk about a raise.

36:37.989 --> 36:41.034
 25%

36:41.159 --> 36:42.452
 5%

36:42.577 --> 36:44.871
 20%

36:44.996 --> 36:47.248
 How about we discuss
this over coffee?

36:47.374 --> 36:50.960
 OK, but you're buying.

36:51.086 --> 36:54.214
 At this rate, I won't
be able to afford it.

36:54.339 --> 36:56.257
[chuckling]

36:56.383 --> 36:59.886
[music playing]

37:05.016 --> 37:08.311
GEORGIE: This way, this way.

37:08.436 --> 37:12.565
Hey, there it is,
the last marker.

37:12.691 --> 37:14.192
 OK, let's get back to camp.

37:14.317 --> 37:16.277
 Well, look who it is.

37:16.403 --> 37:18.238
 Took you long enough.

37:18.363 --> 37:21.032
This is our last marker, which
means I win and you lose.

37:21.157 --> 37:23.284
But you're probably getting
used to that by now.

37:23.410 --> 37:25.412
 Actually, it's
our last marker too.

37:25.537 --> 37:28.331
And I would have been here hours
ago if Adam wasn't so slow.

37:28.456 --> 37:29.499
 Hey, I'm the one
following the map

37:29.624 --> 37:31.042
and taking all the
compass readings.

37:31.167 --> 37:32.919
Without me, you'd be lost
somewhere in the Kananaskis

37:33.044 --> 37:34.379
by now.

37:34.504 --> 37:35.505
 Figures you'd make
Adam do all the work.

37:35.630 --> 37:37.007
 I'm so going to
beat you back to camp.

37:37.132 --> 37:39.217
 Do you even know what
direction camp is in?

37:39.342 --> 37:40.301
 Of course, I do.

37:40.427 --> 37:41.928
It's that way, right?

37:45.390 --> 37:46.349
I knew that.

37:46.474 --> 37:47.308
[chuckling]

37:47.434 --> 37:50.812
[music playing]

37:52.731 --> 37:54.232
 What are they doing?

37:54.357 --> 37:55.358

37:55.483 --> 37:56.818
CLAY: Yah!
Yah!

37:56.943 --> 37:57.819
CASS: Come on!

38:04.909 --> 38:05.744
Yah!

38:05.869 --> 38:06.661
CLAY: Yah!

38:06.786 --> 38:07.662
Come on!

Come on!

CASS: Yah!

38:13.209 --> 38:14.961
CLAY: Yup, yup, come on!

Yah!

Yah!
CASS: Come on!

38:17.714 --> 38:18.631
Come on!

38:21.509 --> 38:22.802
Too slow, McMurtry.

38:22.927 --> 38:23.678
I win.

38:23.803 --> 38:25.180
 Barely.

38:25.305 --> 38:26.973
 You're on the
same team, remember?

38:27.098 --> 38:29.351
It doesn't matter who
came in first here.

38:29.476 --> 38:30.727
Your time's pretty good.

38:30.852 --> 38:32.020
Let's see how you
did with the markers.

38:37.067 --> 38:39.402
Well, see what you can do
with a little teamwork.

38:39.527 --> 38:40.653
You're the winners.

38:44.491 --> 38:46.785
 They used us.

38:46.910 --> 38:47.786
 Yup.

38:52.832 --> 38:55.001
 I'm really sorry about today.

38:55.126 --> 38:58.338
I know you're really looking
forward to orienteering.

38:58.463 --> 39:00.090
 That's OK.

39:00.215 --> 39:03.385
We're already signed up for
the real event next month.

39:03.510 --> 39:05.970
 But this time no Jade or Clay.

39:06.096 --> 39:07.389
Just the two of us, right?

39:07.514 --> 39:08.723
 Yeah, promise.

39:15.772 --> 39:19.484
Hey, congratulations on winning.

39:19.609 --> 39:21.986
 Yeah, thank you.

39:22.112 --> 39:24.572
 So don't you think your
whole rivalry with Clay is

39:24.698 --> 39:26.408
getting a little out of hand?

39:26.533 --> 39:28.243
 [sighs] You don't
understand, Georgie.

39:28.368 --> 39:30.203
I was just starting to
get the respect of all

39:30.328 --> 39:31.871
the guys in the rodeo team.

39:31.996 --> 39:34.708
And then Clay comes along
and treats me like I'm

39:34.833 --> 39:37.043
just some tail to be chased.

39:37.168 --> 39:40.630
I worked too long and
too hard for that.

39:40.755 --> 39:44.342
 [sighs] He's
scared of spiders.

39:44.467 --> 39:45.760
 What?

39:45.885 --> 39:46.886
 He nearly fell off
his horse when I tried

39:47.012 --> 39:48.096
to brush one off his shoulder.

39:50.849 --> 39:53.059
 Not such a tough
cowboy after all.

39:53.184 --> 39:56.521
 No, not even close.

39:56.646 --> 39:57.772
 Well, I'll see you later.

40:04.195 --> 40:05.030
 I got them.

40:05.155 --> 40:05.989
 OK.

40:06.114 --> 40:06.948
 [chuckles]

40:07.073 --> 40:07.866
[knocking]

40:07.991 --> 40:08.992
 Come in!

40:09.117 --> 40:12.078
I'll get it.

40:12.203 --> 40:14.039
Hi--

40:14.164 --> 40:18.585
 I'll uh, I'll leave
you two alone to talk.

40:18.710 --> 40:20.378
 Please stay, I'd--

40:20.503 --> 40:21.796
I'd like you to hear this.

40:29.054 --> 40:36.019
I was a guest in your home
and I behaved dreadfully.

40:36.144 --> 40:39.439
And the worst part is I offended
someone very dear to me.

40:43.318 --> 40:50.450
I had no right to call into
question any of the choices

40:50.575 --> 40:51.826
that you have made.

40:54.788 --> 40:57.165
I don't know if you
could ever forgive me.

40:57.290 --> 41:00.126
 Of course, I can forgive you.

41:00.251 --> 41:01.127
 OK.

41:01.252 --> 41:02.462
 [chuckles]

41:02.587 --> 41:04.964
 Oh, I've--

41:05.090 --> 41:06.800
I've traveled all over
the world and I've

41:06.925 --> 41:10.845
seen things so beautiful
that make my heartache.

41:10.970 --> 41:13.014
But you know I
would be lying if I

41:13.139 --> 41:17.852
said I sometimes didn't wonder
what my life would be like--

41:21.606 --> 41:22.774
if I had made different choices.

41:26.778 --> 41:28.655
You're very brave, Lisa,
you always have been.

41:28.780 --> 41:32.075
And I wish you
nothing but happiness.

41:32.200 --> 41:34.327
KATIE: Auntie Evelyn, are you
going to fly the kite with me?

41:34.452 --> 41:35.286
 Oh, I'm so sorry, darling.

41:35.412 --> 41:36.329
I can't.

41:36.454 --> 41:38.248
I-- I have a plane to catch.

41:38.373 --> 41:39.833
And I-- I have to be going.

41:39.958 --> 41:41.835
 Well, why don't you
believe your flight?

41:41.960 --> 41:44.421
And that way you can spend
some more time with us.

41:44.546 --> 41:48.383
 You'd be welcome
to stay, Evelyn.

41:48.508 --> 41:50.051
You're family.

41:50.176 --> 41:53.555
[MUSIC - PHILLIP LARUE, "I'LL BE
 YOUR HOME"]

41:55.432 --> 41:57.058
 I don't know what to say.

41:57.183 --> 41:58.351
 I think you say yes.

41:58.476 --> 42:02.022
[chuckling]

42:05.025 --> 42:05.942
 Yes.

42:06.067 --> 42:07.819
 Ah, it comes with a hug.

42:07.944 --> 42:10.572
[laughter]

42:10.697 --> 42:14.367
 I-- I accept.

42:14.492 --> 42:17.662
You know, Katie, I think I
felt the wind picking up when

42:17.787 --> 42:19.164
I was walking up to the house.

42:19.289 --> 42:22.625
Today might be the perfect
day to fly this kite.

42:22.751 --> 42:23.752
[laughter]

42:23.877 --> 42:24.544
Come on.

42:24.669 --> 42:26.171
Off you go.

42:26.296 --> 42:27.172
Love you.

42:27.297 --> 42:28.089
 Love you too.

42:31.551 --> 42:34.137
Thank you.

42:34.262 --> 42:35.388
 [chuckles]

42:35.513 --> 42:36.806
 Sure this is safe?

42:36.931 --> 42:38.433
Didn't he nearly run
you over yesterday?

42:38.558 --> 42:42.729
 [chuckles] We've made a
lot of progress since then.

42:42.854 --> 42:44.606
 OK.

42:44.731 --> 42:45.774
All right.

42:49.444 --> 42:52.614
 OK, we'll just take
this nice and slow.

42:52.739 --> 42:54.115
Build up his confidence.

42:56.576 --> 42:59.037
Good boy, Lex.

42:59.162 --> 43:02.123
Good boy.

43:02.248 --> 43:03.708
 OK, up, up, up.

43:03.833 --> 43:06.628
 Get it up there.

43:06.753 --> 43:07.545
 There we go!

43:07.671 --> 43:08.713
Look at it!

43:08.838 --> 43:09.756
Katie, come here!

43:09.881 --> 43:10.632
Come here, sweetheart.

43:10.757 --> 43:13.218
Let it go.

43:13.343 --> 43:14.302
Let it go.

43:14.427 --> 43:15.512
Let it out just a little bit.

43:15.637 --> 43:17.055
Just a little bit.

43:17.180 --> 43:17.806
Run!

43:17.931 --> 43:19.391
Run with it, run!

43:19.516 --> 43:20.308
That's it, girl.

43:20.433 --> 43:22.435
Look at that.

43:22.560 --> 43:24.896
[interposing voices]

43:25.021 --> 43:25.772
 Ah!

43:25.897 --> 43:29.067
(SINGING) I'll be your home.

43:29.192 --> 43:29.943
Look at that!

43:30.068 --> 43:33.988
(SINGING) I'll be your home.

43:38.702 --> 43:41.496
I'll be your home.

43:41.621 --> 43:42.747
Yeah.

43:42.872 --> 43:44.332
I'll be your home.

43:47.210 --> 43:48.670
I'll be your home.

43:51.381 --> 43:52.841
I'll be your home.

43:55.552 --> 43:57.012
I'll be your home.

44:00.890 --> 44:03.768
I'll be your home.
