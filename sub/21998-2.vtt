I'm gonna Clooney the
hell out of this thing.

20:56.658 --> 20:58.025
All right, thank you.

21:00.691 --> 21:02.325
You know, I-I have a sister.

21:02.923 --> 21:04.820
Her and my mom... oof!

21:04.845 --> 21:06.212
- You know?
- Hmm.

21:10.469 --> 21:13.504
Only time I fell through
a coffee table, that-that time.

21:13.539 --> 21:14.872
(chuckles): That was not normal.

21:14.907 --> 21:16.547
- (laughs): Of course.
- For...

21:17.273 --> 21:19.110
Okay, I have to leave
and go to her show now.

21:19.144 --> 21:21.512
This is her first real gig,
and I can't miss it,

21:21.547 --> 21:22.914
so I hope you guys understand.

21:23.182 --> 21:24.351
I do.

21:27.586 --> 21:28.656
Ah, crap.

21:30.412 --> 21:31.914
It's okay. I'll stay with the girls.

21:31.939 --> 21:33.439
Thank you. Kevin will understand.

21:33.874 --> 21:35.341
All right, yup.

21:35.366 --> 21:36.398
Come on, come on.

21:42.093 --> 21:44.895
Hey, superstar, are you
excited about tonight?

21:46.601 --> 21:49.328
- I don't know.
- You don't know. What?!

21:49.353 --> 21:51.721
What are you talking about?
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

21:51.746 --> 21:54.117
You do know that you are

21:54.320 --> 21:56.054
the greatest singer
in this house, right?

21:56.079 --> 21:58.812
And on the planet, and maybe
in the entire universe?

22:00.119 --> 22:02.015
So I have a little surprise for you.

22:02.169 --> 22:04.929
I made this from the first dress

22:04.954 --> 22:07.258
that I wore the first time I performed

22:07.283 --> 22:08.595
in front of a whole bunch of people.

22:08.619 --> 22:10.992
And I was really nervous,
and I'm telling you,

22:11.017 --> 22:12.818
wearing this gave me confidence.

22:12.861 --> 22:15.547
So, I thought that you might
want to go upstairs

22:15.572 --> 22:17.328
and try it on, and
maybe wear it tonight?

22:17.353 --> 22:19.164
- Yeah.
- You do? Okay.

22:19.262 --> 22:20.929
Go upstairs.
I'm gonna pop in the shower,

22:20.954 --> 22:22.563
and then I'll come in your room
and I'll help you get ready.

22:22.587 --> 22:24.211
- Thanks, Mom.

turned out okay, didn't they?

23:17.400 --> 23:19.094

turn out anything?

23:19.230 --> 23:21.195
What if they were just
great to begin with?

23:21.290 --> 23:23.437
- Don't you ever think about that?
- Think about what?

23:23.462 --> 23:25.697
Maybe we didn't do that much, Beth.

23:26.187 --> 23:28.889
I mean, Tess self-soothed
from two weeks old.

23:29.221 --> 23:31.556
Annie was sleeping ten hours
a night from infancy.

23:31.664 --> 23:33.492
Remember how other
parents would talk about

23:33.517 --> 23:35.586
their sleepless nights
and their terrible babies?

23:35.611 --> 23:37.265
Remember how we used to have to fake it?

23:37.381 --> 23:40.140
What parents pretend to be tired, Beth?

23:40.742 --> 23:42.202

23:42.237 --> 23:44.219
introduce a kid
with these kind of issues

23:44.244 --> 23:46.375
- into our home.
- Randall, you're being ridiculous.

23:46.400 --> 23:47.992
And I think you're being reckless.

23:48.343 --> 23:50.875
Randall, you wanted to adopt.

23:51.079 --> 23:53.360
And now you're Randalling out
on me like this was my idea.

23:53.384 --> 23:54.918
Okay, stop making my name a thing!

23:55.020 --> 23:56.387
And yes, I wanted to adopt.

23:56.412 --> 23:57.874
Got my head around that months ago...

23:57.898 --> 24:00.484
adopting a newborn,
clean-slate baby, like I was

24:00.509 --> 24:03.320
when my parents found me,
but I'm worried, Beth.

24:03.345 --> 24:05.179
Because that's what you do, Randall.

24:05.473 --> 24:06.673
You worry, babe.

24:06.698 --> 24:08.836
But we have talked about this a lot,

24:08.861 --> 24:10.734
and we discussed
how difficult it could be,

24:10.759 --> 24:12.515
and we came to a decision.

24:12.687 --> 24:15.781
And now I'm jet-lagged,
you got me out here sweating,

24:15.806 --> 24:18.789
and I traveled across country
to miss the taping of a sitcom

24:18.814 --> 24:20.906
that I didn't want to come
see in the first place.

24:21.265 --> 24:26.250
So can we please just table
the convo until we get home?

24:26.787 --> 24:27.945
Please?

24:30.922 --> 24:32.823
I guess the part that concerns me, Beth,

24:32.849 --> 24:34.204
- is that we just...
- Oh, my God, you're driving me nuts.

24:34.228 --> 24:35.883

30:16.020 --> 30:17.515

30:17.540 --> 30:20.414
this... this one time his entire life.

30:20.568 --> 30:22.809
It was in college, and, you
know, this girl at a party...

badass, dreadlocked girl,

let's be honest...

30:28.509 --> 30:31.125
17 times out of his nerdy,
sweater-vested-wearing league.

30:31.150 --> 30:32.656

30:33.066 --> 30:34.836
- But he, uh...
- (Beth laughs)

30:34.861 --> 30:37.484
He asked her out anyway.
He called her on the phone.

30:37.509 --> 30:39.804
Good God, he was so nervous,
he made me sweat.

30:39.829 --> 30:40.906
Yeah, I bet.

30:41.516 --> 30:43.429
I still remember his
opening line, you know?

30:43.454 --> 30:45.094
- Mm.
- It was so cheesy.

30:45.119 --> 30:47.422
He was like, "You don't
know who I am, but..."

30:47.447 --> 30:48.648
"But you're about to."

30:50.237 --> 30:51.360
- Wait.
- I'm sorry, you thought

30:51.384 --> 30:53.531
Randall had that kind of game at 19?

30:54.074 --> 30:55.821
Who do you think was
Cyrano-ing the entire thing?

30:55.845 --> 30:57.212
Wait a minute. You?

30:57.237 --> 30:59.836
You... Beth, you fell
for the Manny's game.

30:59.861 --> 31:01.862
Now, you sit there,
and you just think about that

31:01.887 --> 31:04.101
- for a second, little bit.
- Oh, no. It hurts.

31:04.126 --> 31:05.593
- Yeah.
- Damn.

31:05.933 --> 31:06.976
I got got.

31:08.953 --> 31:10.554

31:10.579 --> 31:11.703
in my brother's entire life

31:11.728 --> 31:13.797
that he's actually risked failure.

31:15.404 --> 31:16.547
It's the only time.

31:18.853 --> 31:20.312
You know how hard that was for him?

31:20.845 --> 31:22.320
How scary that was for him?

31:22.345 --> 31:23.656
The man was terrified.

Sweetheart, you sang
incredibly beautifully.

32:41.361 --> 32:43.329
You should be so happy right now.

32:43.461 --> 32:45.461
- "Incredibly beautifully"?
- Mm-hmm.

32:46.207 --> 32:47.429
Why do you do that?

32:48.076 --> 32:50.851
Do what? I'm complimenting you.
I'm proud of you.

32:50.876 --> 32:52.687
No, you feel sorry for me.

32:53.104 --> 32:56.312
(chuckles) What on earth
would make you think that, Kate?

32:56.337 --> 32:58.578
You overcompensate for me, Mom,
and you always have.

32:58.694 --> 33:00.929
And here I am, a 37-year-old woman,

33:00.954 --> 33:03.195
and you still make me
feel like a stupid...

33:04.952 --> 33:06.281
fat, little kid.

33:07.205 --> 33:10.695
I'm sorry. What have I ever done
to make you feel like that?

33:10.788 --> 33:12.390
- I'm not gonna do this.
- Kate.

33:36.876 --> 33:14.906
- I want to know. What have I ever done?
- You existed.

33:18.941 --> 33:20.675
- It's everything about you, Mom.
- (sighs)

33:21.108 --> 33:24.375
It's not just that you're
beautiful or thin.

33:25.555 --> 33:28.281
Or that you have perfect pitch
even when you talk.

33:28.504 --> 33:30.008
It's everything.

33:31.251 --> 33:32.836
And you wanted a daughter like you,

33:32.861 --> 33:34.844
- and I was never gonna be you.
- No. No.

33:34.869 --> 33:36.259
I never wanted you to be like me, Kate.

33:36.283 --> 33:39.485
No! You wanted me to be the
you that you never became.

33:49.245 --> 33:50.429
Well, you did it, Ma.

33:50.744 --> 33:53.765
You got me to say
terrible, unfair things.

33:54.456 --> 33:56.416
Least you could do
is say something terrible back.

33:59.391 --> 34:02.008
I-I just can't think of anything
that would be...

34:02.720 --> 34:05.601
quite that terrible, is the thing.

34:07.586 --> 34:09.460
You're my entire life, Kate.

Maybe I... maybe I overdid it.

of my very first real gig.

This.
