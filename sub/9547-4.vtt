Hey, is the Captain around?
He forgot to sign these.

00:10.105 --> 00:12.314
Yeah, he's in his office
talking to Linda.

00:19.327 --> 00:21.311
Look who's here.
Monk and Natalie just walked in.

00:21.858 --> 00:23.091
Hi guys!

00:27.247 --> 00:30.435
- Linda, hi! You look great.
- Thanks, so do you.

00:32.429 --> 00:33.763
Is that your new place?

00:33.956 --> 00:35.556
As of last weekend.

00:35.618 --> 00:38.054
- I love those curtains.
- Thanks.

00:38.104 --> 00:41.734
It's like a television 
and a telephone.-Together?

00:41.784 --> 00:43.244
Brave new world, huh?

00:43.698 --> 00:46.031
I guess you can't call somebody
in your underwear.

00:46.098 --> 00:48.044
- Sure you can.
- Natalie, they would see you.

00:49.694 --> 00:53.008
We have a webcam date
at 6:30 every night.

00:53.168 --> 00:55.918
It's the only chance I get to see her
now that she's moved uptown.

00:55.968 --> 00:57.168
Well, don't worry, baby,

00:57.212 --> 01:00.685
you'll get to see plenty
of me in Hawai'i. Look. Wait.

01:00.924 --> 01:01.957
See what I bought?

01:04.525 --> 01:06.175
Now, hold on.
For the full effect...

01:10.246 --> 01:12.580
- I love it.
- Hawaii. Yeah.

01:12.581 --> 01:16.265
Yeah, we're leaving Friday. I haven't
had a vacation in over 10 years.

01:16.282 --> 01:19.369
- Oh, so jealous. Where are you staying?
- On Kauai.

01:19.721 --> 01:24.499
And look,
it's the North Shore right... there.

01:24.921 --> 01:26.229
And we may never come home.

01:26.404 --> 01:27.924
You're gonna have so much fun.

01:28.416 --> 01:30.583
I am counting the minutes.

01:30.847 --> 01:34.375
And, is that the correct time?
It's 7:00. I gotta go.

01:34.412 --> 01:36.892
I've got a closing tomorrow,
so I have to crunch some numbers.

01:36.908 --> 01:38.075
What happened to Sean?

01:38.212 --> 01:41.202
Well, uh, he's up in Marin County,
showing a house.

01:41.456 --> 01:43.540
Better him than me, right?

01:43.850 --> 01:46.885
So I love you,
and I will see you tomorrow!

01:47.191 --> 01:48.354
- Bye, all.
- Bye.

01:48.447 --> 01:49.502
Good-bye!

01:49.824 --> 01:50.871
I love you too.

01:51.000 --> 01:52.526
Good-bye. I mean, aloha.

01:55.844 --> 01:56.912
You're a lucky man.

01:58.229 --> 01:59.846
So Sean is her partner?

02:00.250 --> 02:02.766
Yeah, yeah, they've been
together for 17 years.

02:02.800 --> 02:04.998
Oh, God, that's longer
than most marriages.

02:05.717 --> 02:07.233
Longer than mine.

Hi, Sean Corcoran. Fusco Realty.
Come on in.

02:22.367 --> 02:24.411
Sorry we're late. We got a little lost.

02:24.544 --> 02:26.946
No problem, I was just
returning some phone calls.

02:28.019 --> 02:29.503
The owners are out of town.

02:29.568 --> 02:31.018
So we can take our time.

02:31.315 --> 02:32.648
I love the foyer.

02:32.686 --> 02:34.031
All original mahogany.

02:34.181 --> 02:36.186
And the fixtures are all custom made.

02:36.680 --> 02:37.943
Shall we start upstairs?

Could you hold on? Just a...

04:02.099 --> 04:03.999
Leland, what are you doing here?

04:04.105 --> 04:06.930
I'm taking you out to breakfast.
Charlie!

04:07.047 --> 04:08.131
Charlie, take a break.

04:08.540 --> 04:10.363
Well, what is going on?

04:10.952 --> 04:14.780
Well, this tree was dead. If it fell
down, it would take out half your roof,

04:14.813 --> 04:17.202
so I called a buddy of mine
at the Parks Department.

04:18.296 --> 04:21.738
You are really a full-service
boyfriend, aren't you?

04:25.350 --> 04:26.383
What's he doing?

04:26.512 --> 04:30.256
Some idiot parked in front of your
fire hydrant, so I made a phone call.

04:30.997 --> 04:33.266
You know,
I think you worry a little too much.

04:33.810 --> 04:35.477
It's my job to worry about you.

04:36.176 --> 04:37.176
That's sweet.

04:38.858 --> 04:39.875
Sorry.

04:40.512 --> 04:41.512
Linda Fusco.

04:43.166 --> 04:44.166
Yes?

04:47.162 --> 04:48.162
What?

04:49.719 --> 04:50.719
Oh, my God.

04:53.302 --> 04:54.302
When?

04:58.371 --> 04:59.991
No, I understand. Thank you.

05:02.518 --> 05:05.930
- Sweetie, what's wrong?
- t's Sean. He was killed last night.

05:06.128 --> 05:08.442
In the house that he was
showing. He was murdered.

05:08.737 --> 05:09.870
Sweetie, I'm sorry.

05:10.933 --> 05:12.460
That's Marin County, right?

05:13.182 --> 05:15.511
I know some guys up there.
We'll work this together.

05:15.676 --> 05:18.096
No, no, no, Leland. Don't leave me.

05:20.048 --> 05:24.050
Okay. Don't worry, I'm here.
I'm here. It's okay.

05:36.515 --> 05:37.517
Help you?

05:37.581 --> 05:40.294
Yes, I am Natalie Teeger,
and this is Adrian Monk.

05:40.561 --> 05:42.984
Ah, yeah, yeah, I talked to
Leland Stottlemeyer.

05:43.017 --> 05:44.284
He said you'd be dropping by.

05:44.842 --> 05:47.400
Guess he didn't think our little
department could handle

05:47.434 --> 05:49.380
- a grown-up homicide, huh?
- No no.

05:49.434 --> 05:51.694
Not the whole department.
It's just one guy.

05:51.815 --> 05:53.111
Stottlemeyer worked

05:53.193 --> 05:56.276
with a guy from here 20 years ago
in Malibu. Apparently, the guy

05:56.343 --> 05:57.975
was a real... What was the word?

05:58.440 --> 06:00.521
- Hammerhead.
- Hammerhead.  That's the word, like:

06:00.613 --> 06:02.038
Just one guy.

06:02.734 --> 06:05.021
20 years ago. Malibu.

06:07.034 --> 06:09.332
No, no.

06:09.366 --> 06:11.633
Not... no, did I say... not Malibu.

06:11.662 --> 06:13.179
- No, it wasn't you.
- It wasn't you.

06:13.212 --> 06:15.277
Yeah he never actually said who.. Never.

06:15.307 --> 06:16.898
But, uh, it wasn't you. Who are you?

06:16.924 --> 06:17.924
What is your name?

06:18.543 --> 06:21.560
- Hendrix.
- Hendrix. Nah, definitely wasn't you.

06:21.610 --> 06:23.526
Yeah,
that was the guy he said it wasn't.

06:23.560 --> 06:25.360
All right, all right. You can come in,

06:25.761 --> 06:27.918
but not one word. Do you understand?

06:28.007 --> 06:29.368
Observer status only.

06:30.440 --> 06:31.545
Keep your mouth shut.

06:40.923 --> 06:44.229
Mr. and Mrs. Young?
Just a couple more questions,

06:44.259 --> 06:45.293
if you don't mind.

06:45.478 --> 06:47.425
You said the killer was 5'7", right?

06:48.120 --> 06:51.268
He was hiding in the bathroom,
and he came out and he shot

06:51.407 --> 06:52.561
Sean Corcoran.

06:53.405 --> 06:55.161
- Then what?
- He just stood there.

06:55.292 --> 06:57.075
For a couple seconds.
Then we just ran away.

06:57.155 --> 06:58.367
He could've killed us.

06:59.167 --> 07:02.223
I don't know why he didn't.

07:02.452 --> 07:04.732
- Did he say anything?
- Excuse me?

07:04.949 --> 07:06.447
I've been thinking about it...

07:07.170 --> 07:09.187
I think it might've been a woman.

07:09.941 --> 07:14.545
Why do you say that? The lips.
They were sort of a coral peach.

07:14.869 --> 07:15.869
Lipstick?

07:16.057 --> 07:18.968
I'm a buyer for a cosmetics company.

07:19.487 --> 07:21.506
It's a pretty unusual shade.

07:22.234 --> 07:24.108
I think Runway makes one.

07:24.592 --> 07:25.934
I love Runway.

07:26.267 --> 07:28.900
- It's so expensive. I can't afford it.
- Why not?

07:29.833 --> 07:31.733
Oh, yeah.

07:32.245 --> 07:33.245
It was her.

07:33.295 --> 07:37.788
She said something.
I was just answering her. It wasn't you.

07:39.330 --> 07:40.347
Lieutenant.

07:40.830 --> 07:44.108
- We found the point of entry.
- Excuse me.

07:53.367 --> 07:55.353
Okay. All right. Well...

07:56.323 --> 07:57.557
Simple as pie, huh?

07:58.057 --> 08:00.007
He, or, she...

08:00.553 --> 08:03.980
breaks the glass, reaches in,
throws the lock, opens the door.

08:04.930 --> 08:06.838
- Permission to speak.
- Permission denied.

08:06.971 --> 08:09.144
- Permission denied?
- Permission to speak anyway.

08:09.280 --> 08:11.874
Just say one thing real quick,
and then I'll shut up.

08:14.337 --> 08:15.771
These shards of glass...

08:15.841 --> 08:17.074
they're still intact.

08:17.141 --> 08:19.671
If she came in this way,
she would've stepped on them.

08:20.514 --> 08:23.380
So... at least some of them
would be cracked.

08:24.296 --> 08:26.260
Or maybe she stepped over 'em, right?

08:26.882 --> 08:30.719
Like... this. Right?

08:30.819 --> 08:32.399
That makes sense, doesn't it?

08:33.307 --> 08:34.307
Maybe.

08:38.557 --> 08:39.924
Or she had a key.

08:45.538 --> 08:46.853
I still can't believe it.

08:48.471 --> 08:52.170
I feel like crying, but I can't.
Is that normal?

08:52.652 --> 08:56.583
- Anything you feel is normal.
- It's just such a shock.

08:57.644 --> 09:01.134
It is so heartbreaking.
I just talked to Keri...

09:01.168 --> 09:03.722
that's Sean's wife.
She's devastated. Well, we all are.

09:04.633 --> 09:06.193
They really think that it was a woman?

09:06.566 --> 09:07.776
Well, they're not sure.

09:09.167 --> 09:11.400
Who else had a key to that house?

09:11.872 --> 09:13.029
Well, let's see...

09:13.679 --> 09:15.587
The homeowners, obviously, and...

09:16.219 --> 09:19.288
probably some relatives.
Maybe some household help.

09:21.829 --> 09:23.096
Anybody here?

09:23.166 --> 09:24.166
Your sales staff?

09:24.414 --> 09:26.612
Yeah, there was a lock box
on the front door.

09:26.662 --> 09:30.211
Uh, yeah, that's true. Any one
of the agents ould've gotten in, but...

09:31.528 --> 09:33.466
it could not have been anyone here.

09:34.084 --> 09:35.084
We are a family.

09:36.146 --> 09:39.096
- Did Sean have any enemies?
- No.

09:41.012 --> 09:42.012
Wait.

09:42.134 --> 09:43.239
There was one client.

09:43.510 --> 09:44.528
A woman?

09:44.598 --> 09:46.841
Her name was Hubbert. Helen Hubbert.

09:47.707 --> 09:50.823
Sean sold her a property last year,
and she had been writing him letters.

09:50.840 --> 09:52.760
And it was pretty nasty stuff.

09:53.054 --> 09:54.803
I think the letters are in his office.

09:55.300 --> 09:57.074
Is this a picture of you
with your father?

09:57.124 --> 09:58.124
My grandfather.

09:58.360 --> 10:00.073
It's him just before he died.

10:01.042 --> 10:02.543
Sean's office is this way.

10:09.590 --> 10:10.740
Was he leaving?

10:10.963 --> 10:13.665
Well, it's no secret that he was
starting his own company.

10:14.208 --> 10:15.576
That happens all the time.

10:17.242 --> 10:18.267
Yes.

10:18.456 --> 10:20.745
Here it is. Helen Hubbert.

10:21.513 --> 10:23.665
I met her at a closing once.

10:24.015 --> 10:25.890
She didn't seem dangerous.

10:25.986 --> 10:27.603
Maybe a little tightly wound, but...

10:28.811 --> 10:32.794
- I guess you can never tell.
- No. You can't.

10:34.615 --> 10:36.381
Well, if you will excuse me.

10:36.922 --> 10:40.345
I am going to go home...
and have a nervous breakdown.

10:48.186 --> 10:49.403
You okay?

10:51.440 --> 10:53.790
- What is it?
- I'm afraid to say it out loud.

10:54.903 --> 10:56.786
She knows how to use a shotgun.

10:56.827 --> 10:59.360
She had a motive. You saw those boxes.

10:59.822 --> 11:02.337
He was taking a lot
of their clients with him.

11:02.398 --> 11:04.615
- Wait, are you talking about Linda?
- Shh!

11:07.701 --> 11:11.501
Natalie... she's the same height as the
killer, she had a key to the house.

11:11.555 --> 11:13.562
Mr. Monk,
that's the captain's girlfriend.

11:13.926 --> 11:16.187
I- I don't believe it.

11:16.363 --> 11:18.546
I mean, it could all
just be a coincidence, right?

11:21.475 --> 11:22.738
I found it in her purse.

11:23.160 --> 11:24.914
Coral Peach by Runway.

11:27.931 --> 11:32.741
Great, thank you. Yeah,
I'll see you there. Aloha to you too.

11:33.936 --> 11:37.055
I just booked the second best ukulele
band in San Francisco. I'm, uh, throwing

11:37.239 --> 11:41.385
the captain and Linda a little
going away party. It's a luau.

11:41.539 --> 11:44.006
- Grass skirts, limbo dancing.
- They're still going?

11:44.056 --> 11:45.837
Yeah, they pushed it back a week,

11:45.885 --> 11:48.283
until after the funeral,
but they're still gonna go.

11:48.684 --> 11:50.888
The captain says Linda
needs it now more than ever.

11:51.240 --> 11:54.686
- You know, plus any excuse for a luau.
- Is he here?

11:54.736 --> 11:56.919
No. He took Linda to lunch.
Can I get him on his cell?

11:57.351 --> 12:01.483
No, no. Actually, we wanted
to talk to you. It's kind of important.

12:01.499 --> 12:04.648
Randy, what we're about to tell
you is absolutely confidential.

12:04.681 --> 12:06.213
You can't repeat it to anyone.

12:07.340 --> 12:08.434
Are you in love with me?

12:08.513 --> 12:10.013
What? No!

12:10.462 --> 12:12.823
I think Linda Fusco
might have killed her partner.

12:13.284 --> 12:16.440
What? I don't believe that.
There's no way, Monk.

12:16.515 --> 12:19.032
- Am I in love with you?
- No, it's Linda. We know her.

12:19.106 --> 12:20.356
- Do we?
- Yeah.

12:20.822 --> 12:23.556
Besides, it... it's impossible.

12:23.732 --> 12:26.812
I mean, she was talking to the Captain
that night on the webcam

12:26.862 --> 12:28.722
from her house.
I mean, Monk, you were there.

12:28.755 --> 12:29.889
I know, but let's just...

12:29.939 --> 12:31.989
Okay, what?
It was about at 7:00?  Right?

12:32.389 --> 12:34.706
And she was...

12:35.128 --> 12:38.931
definitely here in Richmond at 7:00.
The guy was killed when?

12:39.008 --> 12:40.735
7:20. There were two witnesses.

12:40.790 --> 12:42.940
Okay, he was killed at 7:20...

12:43.345 --> 12:46.276
here in Novato... hmm...

12:46.374 --> 12:48.868
- It's, like, 30 miles.
- 32.2.

12:48.899 --> 12:51.463
Okay, 32.2 miles in 20 minutes?

12:51.579 --> 12:54.405
There's no way. That's 100 miles
an hour through traffic.

12:55.388 --> 12:56.598
It's just not possible.

12:57.152 --> 13:00.269
Maybe she had a jetpack.
Like in those James Bond movies.

13:00.302 --> 13:02.568
Yeah, well, there's no such thing
as a working jet pack.

13:03.128 --> 13:04.391
Don't ask me how I know.

13:04.623 --> 13:06.869
Randy, do you have any ideas?

13:06.941 --> 13:10.746
I mean, anything at all.
One of your crazy theories?

13:11.175 --> 13:12.275
My crazy theories.

13:13.354 --> 13:15.494
- Like what?
- Like me being in love with you?

13:15.521 --> 13:16.894
You think that's crazier

13:16.944 --> 13:19.715
than Linda Fusco flying across
San Francisco in a jet pack?

13:19.974 --> 13:20.974
Too close to call.

13:21.285 --> 13:23.501
Well, here they come.
Ask her for yourself.

13:25.590 --> 13:28.231
False alarm. I heard a motorcycle.
I thought it was them.

13:28.273 --> 13:29.963
I thought the captain
sold his motorcycle.

13:30.020 --> 13:31.668
Yeah, he did. Linda has one too.

13:51.987 --> 13:53.002
Pretty sweet, huh?

13:53.035 --> 13:54.044
Where did you get that?

13:54.120 --> 13:56.340
From a biker friend of mine.
I did him a favor once.

13:56.365 --> 13:58.215
- What kind of favor?
- You really wanna know?

13:59.474 --> 14:00.474
Okay, so I just...

14:00.563 --> 14:02.563
how exactly...

14:05.739 --> 14:08.272
Mr. Monk, why don't you just wait here?
I can do this.

14:08.489 --> 14:10.343
No! No, no, no.
When I talk to Leland, I...

14:10.539 --> 14:13.506
I have to tell him that
I checked it out myself.

14:13.586 --> 14:15.352
Okay, then let's do it.

14:15.436 --> 14:16.446
Yeah, I don't think so.

14:16.499 --> 14:19.170
Brand-new, straight from the factory,
nobody's even worn it.

14:22.568 --> 14:25.451
Mr. Monk, if you don't put it on,
bugs are going to fly into your mouth.

14:26.063 --> 14:28.245
- Can't you just avoid them?
- I can't avoid the bugs.

14:28.279 --> 14:31.312
Sure you can. You see a bug. Zigzag.

14:31.533 --> 14:32.950
See another bug. Zig. Zag.

14:32.982 --> 14:34.664
If you don't put it on, we're not going.

14:43.205 --> 14:44.238
What's so funny?

14:44.659 --> 14:47.176
Nothing, sorry. I was just thinking
about something else.

14:47.836 --> 14:49.003
You look great.

14:49.206 --> 14:50.885
Here you go. Hop on.

14:52.398 --> 14:54.052
Would you stop... stop laughing.

14:54.086 --> 14:55.459
Would you, please?

14:56.383 --> 14:57.383
All right.

14:57.705 --> 15:00.305
- Born to be mild.
- That's funny.

15:00.674 --> 15:03.841
Yeah, yeah, instead of wild, then you
said mild. That's...

15:04.291 --> 15:05.757
that's hilarious. Okay,

15:06.193 --> 15:08.210
we're here at Linda's house.

15:08.299 --> 15:12.566
She had 20 minutes to get there, so...
you're really gonna have to haul bottom.

15:12.782 --> 15:13.816
Haul bottom?

15:14.050 --> 15:16.950
It's biker talk. It just means
don't stop for anything.

15:17.244 --> 15:18.478
- All right?
- Got it.

15:19.111 --> 15:20.159
All right, hold on.

15:20.283 --> 15:22.181
- To what?
- To me.

15:24.695 --> 15:26.395
I'm... I... I'm okay.

15:26.699 --> 15:28.393
Mr. Monk,
you're gonna fall off the seat.

15:28.436 --> 15:30.675
I know what I'm doing, okay?
I'll just lean forward.

15:30.708 --> 15:32.059
It's called weight displacement.

15:32.060 --> 15:36.136
We're wasting valuable time.
Let's do it. Ready.

15:37.052 --> 15:39.219
And... go!

15:42.891 --> 15:44.058
Are you all right?

15:45.554 --> 15:47.421
Wipes! Wipes.

17:20.904 --> 17:21.904
Well?

17:21.953 --> 17:24.719
- Could she have done it?
- Done what?

17:24.769 --> 17:29.014
Mr. Monk, check the stopwatch!
An hour and five minutes.

17:29.388 --> 17:32.172
- Not even close.
- So... just remind me.

17:32.239 --> 17:34.948
The captain's girlfriend. She couldn't
have done it. We proved it.

17:35.031 --> 17:36.481
Right! Linda.

17:36.634 --> 17:38.418
Thank God.

17:38.534 --> 17:44.465
She couldn't have done it.
Oh, what a relief. She didn't do it.

17:44.531 --> 17:47.698
Natalie, I have never been
happier to be wrong.

18:26.208 --> 18:27.208
Captain!

18:27.308 --> 18:28.658
Hey, what are you guys doing here?

18:28.675 --> 18:30.481
Oh, we're waiting for you.
You got a minute?

18:30.915 --> 18:34.189
Not really, I'm supposed
to meet Linda in... five minutes ago.

18:34.844 --> 18:37.716
She's still working through what
happened. I hate to leave her alone.

18:38.777 --> 18:41.161
Yeah, we have some news, some good news.

18:41.202 --> 18:44.626
Yeah. We have good news. We think
we know who killed Sean Corcoran.

18:44.659 --> 18:45.726
That's great.

18:45.970 --> 18:47.104
That was fast.

18:47.154 --> 18:48.154
Yeah.

18:48.220 --> 18:50.687
This individual has a motive...

18:50.737 --> 18:52.914
- Good. Motive is good.
- Owns a shotgun,

18:53.654 --> 18:55.504
and had access to the house.

18:55.878 --> 18:57.799
Well, let's pick him up.
What's his name?

19:02.989 --> 19:04.922
Monk, the suspect has a name, right?

19:07.420 --> 19:08.648
And what is that name?

19:17.577 --> 19:18.610
Linda.

19:19.714 --> 19:20.860
Linda Fusco.

19:29.294 --> 19:30.511
That's hilarious.

19:30.702 --> 19:34.644
You got me. That's good.
Ha! That's rich.

19:34.753 --> 19:36.845
- See you guys ma~ana.
- Captain?

19:38.120 --> 19:39.120
He's not joking.

19:40.431 --> 19:41.431
He never jokes.

19:43.986 --> 19:44.986
That's true.

19:47.110 --> 19:48.110
She's the guy.

19:49.354 --> 19:52.768
No, no... wait. She... She was at home.
We talked to her.

19:52.818 --> 19:55.611
- She was 30 miles away from the thing.
- Captain, she made a point

19:55.628 --> 19:58.327
of mentioning the time.
It was 7:00, rember?

19:58.593 --> 20:00.393
We were her alibi.

20:02.084 --> 20:03.168
How?

20:03.262 --> 20:06.513
- I don't know how. But she's the guy.
- Captain...

20:07.699 --> 20:10.579
- we found this at the scene.
- Hibiscus.

20:10.787 --> 20:12.004
Linda was putting a flower

20:12.038 --> 20:15.105
just like it in her hair the night
Sean Corcoran was killed.

20:16.621 --> 20:17.621
A lot of people...

20:19.227 --> 20:21.238
I can't believe
we're having this discussion.

20:21.239 --> 20:22.974
- I can't either.
- What about the lunatic?

20:23.024 --> 20:24.862
The, uh,
the client that wrote those letters?

20:24.912 --> 20:27.658
- Have you even looked at her?
- Captain, this isn't easy for me.

20:27.675 --> 20:29.957
Oh, really? What is?

20:33.063 --> 20:34.841
You're talking about
the woman I love, Monk.

20:34.892 --> 20:37.142
I know. I know.

20:39.585 --> 20:41.644
I think I know what's going on here.

20:43.062 --> 20:45.062
You look at me, and you can't stand it.

20:45.831 --> 20:47.281
I have what you want.

20:48.003 --> 20:50.169
A badge, a woman,

20:50.819 --> 20:51.819
a life.

20:53.261 --> 20:55.094
- That's true.
- But... But nothing!

20:55.566 --> 20:59.900
This is not my problem, Monk.
This is your problem. You deal with it.

21:00.115 --> 21:03.049
All right, look. Why don't we...
Why don't we talk to a neutral party?

21:03.176 --> 21:04.730
We could call the Marin County D.A....

21:04.763 --> 21:06.855
I am done talking! I am done talking.

21:06.909 --> 21:08.851
But I'm gonna do you a favor, Monk.

21:09.042 --> 21:10.426
For old time's sake.

21:10.692 --> 21:13.092
I'm gonna forget that you said anything.

21:13.794 --> 21:15.027
This never happened.

21:18.585 --> 21:19.585
Okay?

21:21.489 --> 21:22.897
Now, if you'll excuse me,

21:23.108 --> 21:24.742
my girlfriend is very upset.

21:26.634 --> 21:28.765
Her partner has just been murdered.

21:50.403 --> 21:52.326
You don't mind if we record this, right?

21:52.377 --> 21:53.550
It's your party.

21:54.093 --> 21:56.165
For the record,
your name is Helen Hubbert.

21:56.232 --> 21:59.215
You teach physical education
at Edge Park Middle School.

22:00.296 --> 22:01.829
So you must be in pretty good shape.

22:02.389 --> 22:04.136
- I guess.
- How tall are you, Ms. Hubbert?

22:04.189 --> 22:05.857
- 5'8".
- 5'8".

22:07.632 --> 22:10.987
I understand you bought a house from
Sean Corcoran last year is that correct?

22:11.689 --> 22:13.479
You're asking about
those letters I sent.

22:14.122 --> 22:15.754
I meant every damn word.

22:15.923 --> 22:19.976
That man lied to me.
The roof leaks, the furnace is crap,

22:20.026 --> 22:22.176
and I've got carpenter
ants in both bathrooms.

22:22.218 --> 22:25.818
Sounds like you have very strong
feelings about Mr. Corcoran.

22:26.075 --> 22:27.209
I hated his guts.

22:27.485 --> 22:30.468
- I'm sorry about what happened, but...
- You hate his guts.

22:32.096 --> 22:36.822
You hate his guts.
I notice you're wearing lipstick.

22:36.871 --> 22:38.556
Do you wear lipstick every day?

22:38.709 --> 22:39.985
Is that a crime now?

22:40.018 --> 22:42.860
No, ma'am, no.
A lot of women wear lipstick.

22:43.328 --> 22:44.607
Doesn't mean anything.

22:45.200 --> 22:46.467
Anything at all.

22:48.841 --> 22:51.253
Where were ya Friday night around 7:30?

22:51.938 --> 22:53.121
- Friday night?
- Yeah.

22:53.433 --> 22:57.576
I was sick. I came home and took
a sleeping pill. That was about 5:00.

22:57.762 --> 22:58.762
So, uh...

22:58.862 --> 23:00.334
you didn't see anybody,

23:00.617 --> 23:04.491
- you didn't talk to anybody?
- No.I live alone. I just went to sleep.

23:04.554 --> 23:06.099
So you don't have an alibi...

23:06.290 --> 23:08.080
for Friday night, do you?

23:08.659 --> 23:11.106
I guess not. Do I need one?

23:13.216 --> 23:16.014
When we spoke on the phone,
you said your father was a locksmith.

23:16.088 --> 23:18.395
- That's right.
- And you used to work in his store.

23:18.583 --> 23:20.214
A couple of summers in high school.

23:20.938 --> 23:22.329
So you could pick a lock.

23:23.044 --> 23:24.811
If I had to, I guess.

23:25.320 --> 23:26.320
Excuse me.

23:26.820 --> 23:28.737
Could you fix the blinds, please?

23:30.241 --> 23:31.417
I don't feel like it.

23:31.491 --> 23:33.116
I wasn't talking to you. Ma'am?

23:33.300 --> 23:36.314
I'm gonna need you
to fix the blinds at this time.

23:36.929 --> 23:37.929
Who is that?

23:38.406 --> 23:40.056
I'm with the FBI.

23:40.985 --> 23:41.985
In Washington.

23:42.504 --> 23:43.687
- Stop it.
- D.C.

23:44.105 --> 23:45.851
Watching you on my computer.

23:47.651 --> 23:49.570
- Screen.
- Don't listen to him, ma'am.

23:49.621 --> 23:52.298
He is not... Ma'am,
I'm gonna need you to fix the blind.

23:52.395 --> 23:54.677
And while you're at it,
pick up the Styrofoam pieces

23:54.710 --> 23:57.151
- scattered about the room.
- He is not a federal agent.

23:57.192 --> 23:59.425
- Yes, he... I am.
- No, he's not.

23:59.475 --> 24:02.355
He's an ex-cop
who hates himself and hates his life

24:02.472 --> 24:05.712
and isn't happy unless
everybody else is as miserable as he is!

24:05.749 --> 24:07.969
I'm sure you wouldn't want
us to inform the school

24:08.019 --> 24:10.182
board about your little
drinking problem.

24:10.248 --> 24:13.022
- What? I mean, how...
- How? How?

24:13.072 --> 24:14.481
We're the FBI, that's how!

24:14.530 --> 24:16.624
God's sakes, he can see
the flask in your pocket.

24:16.691 --> 24:18.745
And Ms. Hubbert,
I'm sure you wouldn't want the IRS

24:18.811 --> 24:22.019
to know about your 2nd job. You've been
moonlighting as a waitress, haven't you?

24:22.048 --> 24:23.984
Have you been reporting
all of your tips?

24:24.000 --> 24:26.896
He's looking inside your purse.
He can see your wad of singles.

24:27.781 --> 24:29.927
Agent Nat Lee? Here,

24:30.024 --> 24:32.924
Here, what do you think of that?

24:32.955 --> 24:35.638
Leland, you can put this woman
away for the rest of her life.

24:35.915 --> 24:37.615
Linda Fusco will still be guilty.

24:41.661 --> 24:44.045
Hey, how'd the interrogation go?

24:44.838 --> 24:46.629
I got a roast pig for the party.

24:48.914 --> 24:49.981
37 pounds.

24:50.499 --> 24:51.604
That's big for a pig.

25:00.747 --> 25:02.797
Did you tell the Captain
your theory about Linda?

25:02.864 --> 25:04.682
Yes. We did.

25:07.562 --> 25:09.077
-- How'd that go over?
- Leland...

25:09.122 --> 25:11.757
It's not Linda. She was 30 miles away.

25:11.797 --> 25:14.131
It was this woman we're holding,
Helen Hubbert.

25:14.165 --> 25:16.577
Weren't you listening? She has no alibi!

25:16.617 --> 25:17.617
Then it can't be her.

25:18.050 --> 25:20.389
- What the hell are you talking about?
- Think about it.

25:20.574 --> 25:23.300
That night,
the killer was hiding in the bathroom.

25:23.489 --> 25:26.953
She could've shot Corcoran any time.
But she didn't. She waited. Why?

25:27.752 --> 25:28.919
She need a witness.

25:30.202 --> 25:31.419
I don't have to listen to this.

25:31.452 --> 25:33.298
Yes, you do! You're a cop.

25:33.389 --> 25:34.877
You're the best cop I know.

25:35.029 --> 25:36.096
Leland, the killer

25:36.130 --> 25:40.196
need a witness
to confirm the exact time of the murder.

25:40.246 --> 25:43.079
Why? There's only one possible reason.

25:43.453 --> 25:45.969
The killer had an
airtight alibi for 7:20.

25:47.221 --> 25:48.221
Now, wa...

25:48.655 --> 25:52.356
Because Helen Hubbert does not have
an alibi, it means it couldn't be her?

25:52.423 --> 25:53.461
That's right.

25:54.020 --> 25:57.247
- Her not having an alibi clears her?
- That's right.

25:57.656 --> 25:59.856
It's the best alibi of all.

26:01.213 --> 26:03.258
I am so glad we're not talking.

26:09.997 --> 26:11.597
I'm 51 years old.

26:13.177 --> 26:14.840
She's the last chance I have.

26:22.225 --> 26:23.225
She's the guy.

26:29.651 --> 26:31.101
So this is it.

26:34.020 --> 26:37.621
All new hardwood floors,
brand-new appliances.

26:39.414 --> 26:41.600
And the closets are great.

26:42.759 --> 26:45.650
It's... it's so... it's so homey.

26:46.916 --> 26:49.516
- And how much is it?
- Uh, it's 2,200.

26:49.584 --> 26:51.151
2,200? Yes.

26:51.879 --> 26:53.879
Well, you are paying for
the neighborhood, and...

26:53.880 --> 26:55.374
and for the schools, of course.

26:55.424 --> 26:59.221
- Of course.
- Will you excuse me?

27:03.098 --> 27:04.098
Oh, hi, honey.

27:04.421 --> 27:06.371
Yeah, back in the saddle.

27:06.885 --> 27:08.502
I'm showing Natalie an apartment.

27:09.909 --> 27:11.175
No, no, just Natalie.

27:13.644 --> 27:14.644
He what?

27:15.789 --> 27:16.973
You can't be serious.

27:19.293 --> 27:20.443
Can I call you back?

27:26.244 --> 27:29.803
- Is everything okay?
- Yes. I'm... I'm fine.

27:29.994 --> 27:33.084
Hey, where's Adrian?
I thought you two were always together.

27:33.174 --> 27:35.305
Oh, you know,
he does something every Wednesday.

27:35.983 --> 27:36.983
It's Thursday.

27:37.017 --> 27:38.051
And Thursday.

27:38.417 --> 27:42.755
You know Mr. Monk. He can't just do
something he has to go back the next day

27:42.805 --> 27:44.425
- and just check his work.
- Right.

27:45.483 --> 27:47.999
I'm sorry,
I forgot I'm showing an apartment

27:48.032 --> 27:49.949
to someone else downstairs, so...

27:50.340 --> 27:52.743
- I'll be right back.
- Okay. Thanks, Linda.

30:06.992 --> 30:07.992
What are you doing?

30:09.113 --> 30:10.481
I could have you arrested.

30:11.984 --> 30:12.984
But you won't.

30:15.167 --> 30:18.725
You don't have to snoop around Mr. Monk.
If you want to ask me a question,

30:18.763 --> 30:21.201
you could just call my office.
Are you afraid of me?

30:23.154 --> 30:24.154
Oh, yeah.

30:25.089 --> 30:26.382
Where's the shotgun?

30:27.584 --> 30:30.519
- What shotgun are we talking about?
- The one that was in there.

30:31.071 --> 30:33.721
You have a barrel cleaner and gun oil.

30:33.824 --> 30:37.290
My grandfather left me
his 12-gauge when he died.

30:37.694 --> 30:38.892
And it was stolen.

30:40.044 --> 30:42.194
- Did you report it?
- Of course I did.

30:42.371 --> 30:44.966
- It would be illegal not to.
- Do you have a copy

30:45.281 --> 30:47.298
- of that report?
- Of course I do.

30:48.115 --> 30:49.115
It's upstairs.

30:50.548 --> 30:51.548
In the bedroom.

30:56.863 --> 30:58.363
It's in here someplace.

31:00.781 --> 31:03.025
Is this where you talk to the captain?

31:03.215 --> 31:04.215
That's right.

31:04.713 --> 31:06.563
6:30 every night.

31:07.583 --> 31:10.227
Leland told me that you're
becoming obsessed with me.

31:11.204 --> 31:12.361
To tell you the truth,

31:12.451 --> 31:13.661
I'm a little flattered.

31:17.240 --> 31:18.528
I know about your wife.

31:21.124 --> 31:22.233
About what happened.

31:23.142 --> 31:24.209
You miss her.

31:25.242 --> 31:27.560
You are obviously in a lot of pain.

31:28.455 --> 31:31.614
And pain like that can make it difficult
to think... Well...

31:32.095 --> 31:33.295
to think clearly.

31:34.765 --> 31:36.782
I wish there was something
I could do to help.

31:37.173 --> 31:38.223
The report.

31:38.895 --> 31:41.901
Oh, I can't find it. I've misplaced it.
I'm... I'm very forgetful.

31:41.986 --> 31:44.086
Mm, no, you're not.

31:47.087 --> 31:48.120
What are you doing?

31:48.557 --> 31:51.358
- Negotiating.
- Well, you're a bad girlfriend.

31:51.408 --> 31:52.417
Maybe.

31:52.467 --> 31:57.440
But I am a very good negotiator.
I'm probably the best negotiator

31:57.477 --> 32:01.377
in Northern California. And I think
that it's time that we close this deal.

32:01.411 --> 32:05.081
Leland is my friend! My best friend,
my only friend, really.

32:05.157 --> 32:10.057
There was this guy last year...
Ke... no... Hal. Hal Tucker.

32:10.107 --> 32:12.624
You know, we went to a hockey game,
but he's in prison now.

32:12.641 --> 32:14.621
I think he was using me.
I'm pretty sure...

32:14.638 --> 32:16.724
Well,
what Leland doesn't know won't hurt him.

32:17.079 --> 32:18.476
That's not true.

32:18.957 --> 32:21.140
That is not true. This will kill him.

32:28.883 --> 32:30.298
Are you looking for something?

32:32.764 --> 32:35.064
Why don't you come
on over here and search me?

32:45.089 --> 32:47.979
- Sorry, she must've figured it out!
- Go, go, just go!

32:48.012 --> 32:50.005
Are you okay? What happened?
Did she have a gun?

32:50.122 --> 32:53.347
No, no. Are my eyes bleeding? Natalie...

32:53.482 --> 32:58.250
She did it. She definitely did it!
And I know how she did it. Go! Just go!

33:05.463 --> 33:06.613
See?

33:07.081 --> 33:08.238
It's all in the hands.

33:08.656 --> 33:11.056
Every movement tells a story.

33:11.641 --> 33:13.260
This means palm tree.

33:14.444 --> 33:17.379
This is shark. Shark.

33:18.625 --> 33:21.431
Rain. Rain.

33:21.475 --> 33:22.492
Hey, Randy!

33:22.620 --> 33:23.779
What does this mean?

33:24.287 --> 33:27.082
Yeah, well, we all know
what that means, Sergeant.

33:27.129 --> 33:28.379
How about this?

33:28.857 --> 33:30.107
What about this?

33:30.938 --> 33:34.257
Okay, you know what?
That's not in the hula spirit at all.

33:35.263 --> 33:38.045
If Hawaii looks anything like this,
I'm not getting off the plane.

33:38.593 --> 33:40.341
So how's the investigation going?

33:40.590 --> 33:43.226
So far, we've hit a dead end,
but we'll catch a break.

33:43.376 --> 33:46.418
We always do.
Say, this would look really cute on you.

33:53.006 --> 33:54.269
Have you talked to Monk?

33:56.317 --> 34:00.323
He's been leaving messages.
I'll call him back when I calm down.

34:00.994 --> 34:01.994
Maybe next year.

34:04.045 --> 34:06.145
Well, it's just that, uh,
something happened.

34:07.103 --> 34:09.918
Yesterday, when I came home,
he was there.

34:12.851 --> 34:17.070
And he was crazy. He was accusing
me of the most horrible things.

34:17.159 --> 34:18.717
I told him to leave you alone.

34:19.652 --> 34:22.257
I'll take care of it. I'll get
a restraining order if I have to.

34:24.331 --> 34:25.665
he was touching me.

34:28.949 --> 34:31.123
And he said that he would set me up

34:31.152 --> 34:33.731
and frame me for the murder
if I didn't sleep with him.

34:37.340 --> 34:39.496
Adrian Monk wanted to sleep with you?

34:41.007 --> 34:42.494
Is that so hard to believe?

34:50.194 --> 34:51.717
All right.

34:51.774 --> 34:55.801
Lower, lower, lower. All right, yeah,
yeah, yeah. Oh, yeah, oh, yeah.

34:55.936 --> 34:57.286
Oh, Natalie, uh...

34:57.494 --> 35:00.744
Sorry,
Captain said that Monk isn't invited.

35:01.410 --> 35:02.693
I feel terrible.

35:03.155 --> 35:04.272
It's like a divorce.

35:04.453 --> 35:05.887
It's always the kids who get hurt.

35:06.327 --> 35:08.303
- Who are the kids?
- Me and you.

35:08.513 --> 35:10.947
Well, Mr. Monk isn't here. It's just me.

35:11.512 --> 35:13.360
You don't have a problem
with me, do you?

35:16.043 --> 35:17.043
No.

35:23.379 --> 35:25.583
No, keep going, keep going.

35:36.063 --> 35:38.378
Excuse me?
Thank you...

35:39.276 --> 35:41.007
I have a little surprise

35:41.074 --> 35:42.324
for the two of you.

35:42.460 --> 35:44.351
If you would just come
with me for one minute.

35:45.579 --> 35:46.579
Come on, Captain.

35:48.635 --> 35:49.635
Come on.

35:49.728 --> 35:50.811
All right, everybody.

35:55.169 --> 35:56.402
Hello, can you see me?

35:56.497 --> 35:58.191
Yes, Mr. Monk, we can see you.

35:58.563 --> 36:00.437
Don't... don't touch anything.

36:00.637 --> 36:01.753
No, Mr. Monk, it's fine.

36:01.803 --> 36:05.270
- Look, here I am.
- Yeah, but don't... don't touch it,

36:05.287 --> 36:06.603
it's fine.

36:07.097 --> 36:11.078
Okay, so, everybody's here.
Including the captain.

36:11.111 --> 36:12.695
Yeah, and me. Hey, Monk!

36:13.221 --> 36:15.536
- Is that Randy? What are you wearing?
- Police tape.

36:15.718 --> 36:17.490
- Where are you?
- That's her bedroom.

36:17.557 --> 36:18.807
So it would appear

36:19.584 --> 36:22.134
Linda was playing some music, remember?

36:23.454 --> 36:26.575
You see? I told you. He was stalking me.
Now, can't you do anything?

36:26.617 --> 36:28.567
Leland! Leland.

36:28.820 --> 36:30.843
I've been trying to call you all day.

36:31.538 --> 36:33.222
Something I have to show you.

36:33.313 --> 36:34.741
I know how she did it.

36:36.233 --> 36:39.333
Leland. Please, just get me out of here.

36:39.847 --> 36:42.825
Please, I can't take this anymore.
Let's just go. Right now.

36:42.859 --> 36:44.117
Let's just go to the airport.

36:44.138 --> 36:47.068
- We've got reservations.
- Oh, forget Hawaii. Let's just...

36:48.176 --> 36:49.860
Let's just disappear.

36:49.946 --> 36:51.530
We can start over.

36:51.784 --> 36:54.707
Maybe South America. Maybe Venezuela.

36:55.428 --> 36:56.445
Listen...

37:00.685 --> 37:01.835
Do you hear that?

37:01.955 --> 37:03.518
I think it's coming from down there.

37:31.736 --> 37:33.065
You can turn that off.

37:37.960 --> 37:41.445
- That's your bedroom.
- It's not her bedroom. It's a replica.

37:41.642 --> 37:42.642
It's a duplicate.

37:43.826 --> 37:44.931
Here's what happened.

37:45.620 --> 37:47.237
You rented this truck

37:47.270 --> 37:48.437
under your maiden name

37:48.555 --> 37:49.805
and went to work.

37:50.169 --> 37:52.002
You duplicated everything.

37:52.189 --> 37:55.560
The furniture, the computer,
the curtains, even the pictures.

37:55.808 --> 37:57.929
You must've been planning it for months.

37:58.150 --> 38:00.605
You began talking
to the captain every night,

38:00.730 --> 38:02.614
from your bedroom at 6:30.

38:03.312 --> 38:05.029
Except for last Friday.

38:05.314 --> 38:07.912
Last Friday,
you were talking from a parking lot

38:08.070 --> 38:10.453
a couple of blocks
from that house in Novato,

38:10.730 --> 38:14.503
- from a robot... uh, satellite.
- Wireless internet.

38:14.532 --> 38:16.403
Whatever. That night,

38:16.576 --> 38:19.193
- you chatted
- with the captain like you always did.

38:19.449 --> 38:20.582
You fooled him.

38:21.196 --> 38:23.600
You fooled me. You fooled everybody.

38:25.016 --> 38:28.382
At 7:00, you signed off
and snuck into the house.

38:28.482 --> 38:31.626
You knew Sean Corcoran had
an appointment there at 7:15.

38:31.687 --> 38:33.237
All you had to do

38:33.303 --> 38:35.553
was hide and wait.

38:37.129 --> 38:38.529
It worked.

38:38.794 --> 38:41.440
Except for the part
about the truck getting towed.

38:41.664 --> 38:43.119
That was a tough break.

38:43.331 --> 38:45.031
When were you gonna go pick it up?

38:45.534 --> 38:47.231
The next time Leland left town?

38:48.343 --> 38:49.431
How did you know?

38:58.326 --> 39:00.000
- A pen?
- The night we talked,

39:00.697 --> 39:02.569
you put the pen down on the table.

39:02.629 --> 39:03.629
I remember.

39:04.629 --> 39:05.938
It rolled a little.

39:06.750 --> 39:10.606
Yesterday in your bedroom,
in your real bedroom,

39:11.273 --> 39:12.365
it didn't roll.

39:14.896 --> 39:16.216
It just stayed there.

39:16.608 --> 39:17.923
I couldn't figure it out.

39:19.229 --> 39:20.296
And then it hit me.

39:20.976 --> 39:22.397
On the night of the murder,

39:22.850 --> 39:24.165
your bedroom must've been

39:24.236 --> 39:25.719
on a slant.

39:27.854 --> 39:29.171
You parked on a hill.

39:31.234 --> 39:32.701
I parked on a hill.

39:37.700 --> 39:39.888
Leland... Sorry.

39:40.834 --> 39:42.267
Yeah, me too.

39:42.755 --> 39:44.405
I did this for us.

39:45.013 --> 39:46.380
We had something.

39:47.060 --> 39:48.488
We had something real.

39:50.106 --> 39:51.929
We could've made it all the way.

39:54.730 --> 39:56.097
Randy?

40:45.064 --> 40:46.714
Here's what I can't figure.

40:47.461 --> 40:51.209
Was it a setup from the beginning,
is that what it was all about?

40:54.293 --> 40:57.864
Did she figure a cop would make a better
alibi or was it for real?

40:59.899 --> 41:02.547
Man, it sure felt like it was for real.

41:04.374 --> 41:05.637
I guess I'll never know.

41:07.930 --> 41:09.805
Sorry, did you say something?

41:11.782 --> 41:12.898
No.

41:15.506 --> 41:17.107
You know, I think it worked out okay.

41:17.416 --> 41:18.994
I mean, all things considered.

41:19.537 --> 41:21.340
But here's what I can't
figure out, though.

41:21.626 --> 41:24.778
Did she really love you
or was it a setup from the beginning?

41:24.835 --> 41:27.630
I mean, maybe she figured a cop
would be the perfect alibi.

41:27.680 --> 41:28.971
Or maybe it was the real thing,

41:29.005 --> 41:32.270
and the plan came later.
Something to think about, though, huh?

41:33.663 --> 41:36.142
Yup. Something to think about.

41:40.183 --> 41:41.316
What was that?

41:42.480 --> 41:43.563
That was nothing.

41:44.710 --> 41:45.810
It was just a rock.
