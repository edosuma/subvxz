You fool!

Don't you see?

01:13.407 --> 01:14.533
Once a millennium,

01:14.616 --> 01:18.662
the planets of this galaxy align
over this very spot.

01:18.912 --> 01:19.955
And today,

01:20.289 --> 01:25.043
the one most worthy
to stand here is none other than I,

-Lord--
-WANDER: (SHOUTING) Hater, is that you?

01:28.630 --> 01:30.424
It's me, Wander.

01:30.674 --> 01:33.594
Are you here
to watch the planets align, too?

01:33.844 --> 01:34.887
Look!

At the precise moment
of the cosmic conjunction,

shall come forth--

WANDER: I traveled the galaxy,

01:58.452 --> 02:00.954
I'm about this tall, wear a hat,

02:01.038 --> 02:02.789
and sometimes I make this face.

02:04.124 --> 02:05.375
Or this one.

02:06.126 --> 02:07.419
Or this.

02:08.337 --> 02:11.423
Or sometimes if I'm feeling
really crazy...

02:11.507 --> 02:13.175
(BOILER HISSING)

02:13.759 --> 02:15.719
A star being of infinite power
will come forth

02:15.844 --> 02:18.430
and grants whoever stands here,
a single wish. (EXHALES)

02:18.514 --> 02:24.269

to control the entire uni--

02:24.436 --> 02:27.439

where my best pal Sylvia is, huh?

02:27.564 --> 02:28.732
No.

02:29.191 --> 02:30.609
Soon, a star being--

02:30.692 --> 02:33.111
You know, I said that--
(GROANS) Where was I?

02:33.695 --> 02:37.491
She wanted to come,
but she had to go to the bathroom.

02:37.699 --> 02:40.619
Zbornaks only go once every 5 months.

02:40.744 --> 02:41.787
Crazy, huh?

02:42.079 --> 02:45.290
She told me it takes a while,
and it's kind of embarrassing.

02:45.374 --> 02:48.126
And so she doesn't want
everybody knowing about it.

02:48.210 --> 02:52.506
So she said, (IMITATES SYLVIA) "Wander,
don't go blabbing like you always do."

02:53.048 --> 02:54.049
Oh.

02:54.508 --> 02:55.884
I don't care!

02:56.051 --> 02:57.094
Where?

02:57.177 --> 02:59.680
But I don't know
where she's going to the bathroom.

02:59.763 --> 03:01.306
Around here somewhere.

03:01.390 --> 03:03.058
Why do you want to know?

03:03.183 --> 03:04.434
(SOFTLY) Weird.

03:05.269 --> 03:08.981
It's okay, though,
'cause I promised her I take pictures.

12:58.570 --> 13:00.155
It gives me this feeling

13:00.239 --> 13:02.324
that starts down in my left toe,

13:02.449 --> 13:04.076
rises up through my gutty works,

13:04.159 --> 13:06.245
makes my heart all warm and toasty,

13:06.328 --> 13:08.705
floats up past the dangly thing
in my mouth...

13:08.789 --> 13:11.500
-Uvula.
-and ends at the top of my head!

13:11.708 --> 13:14.962
(IN SING-SONG VOICE)
It just feels so good.

13:20.843 --> 13:21.844
Phew.

13:21.969 --> 13:23.804
-(SLURPS)
-Ugh!

13:24.221 --> 13:26.807
Listen, I know helping folks is our thing,

13:26.932 --> 13:30.310
but unless you wanna help yourself
into Lord Hater's bony hands

13:30.394 --> 13:33.689
you gotta measure just how
important each good deed is.

13:33.939 --> 13:36.733
Keeping yourself and your buddy
out of an evil warlord's prison?

13:36.817 --> 13:38.235
Whoop. High!

13:38.527 --> 13:40.529
Helping some guy tie his shoe?

13:40.696 --> 13:42.447
(MAKES SOUND) Low.

13:42.573 --> 13:43.574
Way low.

13:44.199 --> 13:45.200
There they are!

13:57.421 --> 13:58.463
You see that ship?

13:59.798 --> 14:02.176
I'm gonna sneak over there
and hot wire it.

14:02.301 --> 14:03.677
And when I give the signal,

14:03.802 --> 14:05.387
(CROWING)

14:05.762 --> 14:09.141
You come running and we will
blast off of this rock to safety.

14:09.766 --> 14:12.311
Now just stay here
and don't call attention to yourself.

14:12.394 --> 14:14.188
This place is crawling with Watchdogs.

14:14.354 --> 14:15.772
-Got it?
-Yes'm.

14:15.898 --> 14:16.899
Good.

14:24.865 --> 14:25.866
(GASPS)

14:27.868 --> 14:29.578
(ENGINE STARTS)

14:29.745 --> 14:31.330

14:32.497 --> 14:34.374

14:35.876 --> 14:37.669
(CROWING ANGRILY)

14:40.172 --> 14:41.340
(YELPS)

14:41.423 --> 14:43.675
Ma'am! Wait!

14:53.477 --> 14:55.020
Flab crabbing hamsplangler.

14:57.147 --> 15:00.317
-A rock? You blew our escape for a rock?
-(EXHALES)

15:00.859 --> 15:02.945
Excuse me, ma'am? You dropped this.

15:03.695 --> 15:07.282
I can't believe you botched our escape
for something as unimportant as...

15:07.366 --> 15:09.326
My baby!

15:09.576 --> 15:10.577
Baby?

15:10.702 --> 15:11.995
Baby!

15:13.539 --> 15:14.540
(LAUGHS, COOS)

15:15.582 --> 15:17.251
(ALL LAUGH AND COO)

15:17.376 --> 15:20.921
Oh, thank you. Thank you!

15:21.129 --> 15:23.757
You're so (STRAINING) welcome.

15:34.309 --> 15:35.477
Okay, new plan.

15:35.561 --> 15:39.523
All we got to do is find
an interdimension... There.

15:40.148 --> 15:41.900
SYLVIA: Interdimensional door.

15:43.151 --> 15:45.737
Out of my way!
Wanted fugitives coming through.

15:45.821 --> 15:47.197
Move it, move it, move it!

15:49.283 --> 15:51.159
Watchdogs? Ha!

15:51.285 --> 15:53.287
They should call them
Watch-us-escape-dogs,

15:53.370 --> 15:54.371
huh, Wander?

15:54.872 --> 15:56.748
I love holding hands.

15:59.168 --> 16:00.419
Wait! Stop!

16:00.919 --> 16:01.920
Out of my way!

16:02.045 --> 16:04.131
This is a matter of life and death!

16:07.509 --> 16:09.261
Got it. Whew.

16:09.553 --> 16:13.307
Really? Really? You ruined
another perfect getaway for--

16:13.390 --> 16:15.642
(EXCLAIMS) Oh, my stars!

16:15.851 --> 16:17.269
I could have been killed!

16:18.437 --> 16:21.106
My dear boy, I owe you my life.

16:21.231 --> 16:22.983
How can I ever thank you?

16:32.409 --> 16:34.203
-Phew.
-(ANIMAL TRUMPETING)

16:38.207 --> 16:40.000
All right. New, new plan.

16:40.375 --> 16:41.710
Want to play dress up?

16:41.919 --> 16:43.045
When don't I?

16:46.757 --> 16:48.383
-Go!
-(ROCKET WHIRRING)

16:51.261 --> 16:53.889
Now, Wander, it's really important
that you stick to the plan.

16:54.014 --> 16:57.392
You've got to pretend to be my butt
long enough for us to escape.

16:57.559 --> 16:58.727
This is serious.

16:59.561 --> 17:01.980
Hang on. Here we go!

17:02.940 --> 17:04.816
Whoo-hoo!

17:06.360 --> 17:10.739
See you later, suckers!
Who looks stupid now?

17:14.701 --> 17:16.119
Flab crabbing hamsplangler.

17:24.545 --> 17:27.714
Stand back. Nothing to see here.
Everything is under control.

17:30.676 --> 17:32.094
(ANTS CHITTERING)

17:32.386 --> 17:34.263
Gentlemants, please.

17:34.346 --> 17:36.181
Might I propose a proposition

17:36.265 --> 17:38.809
to your perplexing
and ponderous peanut problem?

17:44.606 --> 17:45.899
There. And now you got--

17:46.108 --> 17:47.192
BOTH: Peace!

17:47.359 --> 17:50.362
Brothers and sisters, drop your weapons.

17:50.445 --> 17:52.197
The war is over!

17:52.447 --> 17:54.908
ALL: Oh, yay! Peace!

17:55.117 --> 17:57.578
ALL: Oh, yay! Peace!

18:02.124 --> 18:03.125
(CAMERA SHUTTERS CLICKING)

18:03.709 --> 18:05.002
Excuse me, Your Tinyness.

18:05.127 --> 18:08.088
May I borrow your national treasure
for just a moment? Thanks.

18:11.967 --> 18:14.511
You rescued a baby.
You saved a man's life.

18:14.636 --> 18:16.597
You stopped a thousand-year war.

18:16.680 --> 18:18.974
I get it. You're a helpful guy.

18:19.391 --> 18:22.519
Oh, Sylvia, you're making me blush.

18:22.936 --> 18:25.772
But you are going to helpful us to death.

18:26.148 --> 18:28.108
Please. No more helping.

18:28.192 --> 18:32.946
And if you must help someone,
then help me help us to get out of here.

18:33.113 --> 18:35.407
You're right, I totally get it.

18:35.824 --> 18:38.118
From now on, no more helping.

18:38.619 --> 18:40.120
Finally. Thank you.

18:40.704 --> 18:41.914
(SIGHS)

18:42.122 --> 18:46.710
So here is the new, new, new, new,
and may I add, last plan.

18:47.044 --> 18:49.338
(FLY BUZZES)

18:49.588 --> 18:51.840
Ugh. This plan--

18:51.965 --> 18:54.551
Stinks, I know,
but it's the best we've got.

18:55.802 --> 18:58.931
SYLVIA: Okay, so this sewage pipe
leads to that garbage barge,

18:59.556 --> 19:02.351
which will be leaving the planet
in precisely three minutes,

19:03.519 --> 19:06.063
and we'd better be on it when it does.

19:06.146 --> 19:07.231
Got it?

19:07.439 --> 19:08.607
No helping.

19:09.566 --> 19:13.445
Okay. One, two, (STRAINING) three.

19:16.949 --> 19:18.367
They could be anywhere, sir.

19:18.575 --> 19:20.994
It would be helpful if we had some idea
of how to find them.

19:21.161 --> 19:22.579
Helpful! That's it!

19:22.704 --> 19:25.082
(WHISPERING)

19:28.168 --> 19:29.169
Help!

19:33.590 --> 19:34.716

-Help!

19:51.775 --> 19:52.860
Help!

19:53.026 --> 19:54.152
Help!

-Help!
-(SCREAMS)

20:03.036 --> 20:05.622
(SIGHS IN RELIEF) That's better.

20:05.706 --> 20:08.041
-(METAL CLANKING)
-Here, you dropped this.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.251
(BLASTER CHARGING UP)

20:10.419 --> 20:12.880
What? Wait! Sylvia! Sylvia!

20:15.424 --> 20:16.967
Sylvia...

20:23.891 --> 20:28.228
Boy, apprehending you is really gonna help
my standing with Lord Hater, so, thanks!

20:28.395 --> 20:30.189
Well, I love to help.

20:30.606 --> 20:33.025
It's a feeling that starts
down in my left toe.

20:33.150 --> 20:35.235
rises up through my gutty works,

20:35.319 --> 20:37.946
makes my heart all warm and toasty,

20:38.155 --> 20:40.407
floats up past the dangly thing
in my mouth...

20:40.532 --> 20:43.035
-WATCHDOG: Uvula.
-and ends at the top of my--

20:43.911 --> 20:45.537
What's that smell?

20:46.330 --> 20:47.581
(SYLVIA ROARING)

20:50.918 --> 20:51.919
(SQUEALS)

21:00.135 --> 21:02.763
Sylvia, I'm so happy you came back.

21:02.930 --> 21:05.390
I hardly notice
that you smell like spoiled fish,

21:05.474 --> 21:07.518
rotten eggs and moldy sneakers.

21:07.726 --> 21:10.604
Well, while I was slooshing
through that pipe, (SHUDDERS)

21:11.063 --> 21:14.566
I got to thinking. Help myself escape?
(MAKES SOUND)

21:14.900 --> 21:17.110
Or help my best friend?

21:17.361 --> 21:18.904
(MAKES SOUND)

21:20.614 --> 21:22.908
Sylvia, you're glowing!

21:23.242 --> 21:25.786
This? I think that's from
the radioactive sewage.

21:29.122 --> 21:31.291
Oh, that's beautiful.

21:31.750 --> 21:33.043
Now march!

21:37.089 --> 21:40.008
So what's the new, new, new,
new, new plan?

21:40.467 --> 21:44.054
Aside from taking a bath,
I kinda don't have one

21:46.139 --> 21:48.559

Hmm?

22:09.538 --> 22:10.539
(FLY BUZZES)

22:11.206 --> 22:12.291
What just happened?

22:12.416 --> 22:15.502
See, that's the other nice thing
about helping folks.

22:15.627 --> 22:17.921
Sometimes they help you right back.

22:18.046 --> 22:19.214
But between you and me,

22:19.298 --> 22:21.717
this is the dirtiest
clean getaway we've ever made.

22:22.009 --> 22:23.635
Maybe we should help tidy up!
