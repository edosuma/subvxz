WEBVTT

00:19.062 --> 00:20.759
[Avery]
Previously on Swamp Thing...

00:20.846 --> 00:23.110
Alec Holland is alive.

00:23.197 --> 00:24.415
Bullshit!

00:24.502 --> 00:25.329
[Lucilia]  Matt saw him.

00:25.416 --> 00:26.678
Matt, don't shoot.

00:26.765 --> 00:28.680
If he gets to town
and starts talking,

00:28.767 --> 00:30.900
all three of us
are going down for
murder and conspiracy.

00:30.987 --> 00:32.858
[Abby]  Whatever's gotten
ahold of you,
it was born in the swamp.

00:32.945 --> 00:35.165
[Alec]
It's lashing out in anger.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.298
[Abby]  I need to
understand this "rot",
if I'm every gonna cure you.

00:37.385 --> 00:38.864
[screaming]

00:38.951 --> 00:41.171
-Where's Avery?
-Avery isn't here right now.

00:41.258 --> 00:43.391
Until he returns,
you'll be answering to me.

00:43.478 --> 00:44.479
-[gun cocks]
-Please, Avery.

00:46.002 --> 00:47.612
[both grunt]

00:47.699 --> 00:50.398
Mr. Ellery, I'm so sorry
that Avery has been delayed.

00:50.485 --> 00:53.009
I was promised data
regarding
a major breakthrough,

00:53.096 --> 00:56.447
and now, he can't be
bothered to show?

00:56.534 --> 00:58.362
I'm just wondering
if you could live

00:58.449 --> 01:00.843
with killing your own father.

01:00.930 --> 01:02.366
All these years,
you already knew.

01:02.453 --> 01:03.237
-Give me the shotgun.
-I wanna know the truth!

01:03.324 --> 01:04.151
[Matt screams]

01:05.587 --> 01:06.631
[Avery groans]

01:30.786 --> 01:31.830
[mumbles] I'm not gonna die.

01:35.878 --> 01:37.097
[groans]

01:37.184 --> 01:38.533
[winces] Ow-wee.

01:39.708 --> 01:42.102
[groans] Shit.

01:43.190 --> 01:44.408
[eerie indistinct voices]

01:51.328 --> 01:53.765
All right, then.

01:53.852 --> 01:54.940
[male voice]
What you waiting for?

02:00.990 --> 02:02.078
[breath trembling]

02:04.341 --> 02:05.299
[moans]

02:07.170 --> 02:08.171
[voices whispering
indistinctly]

02:16.962 --> 02:19.487
The moss... Moss grows
on the north side.

02:19.574 --> 02:22.925
That means Marais is southeast.

02:23.012 --> 02:25.057
[muttering] Southeast.

02:26.798 --> 02:28.017
Marais is southeast.

02:33.283 --> 02:34.371
[rustling]

02:37.026 --> 02:37.896
[Avery] What the hell?

02:42.205 --> 02:43.250
Somebody there?

02:44.555 --> 02:45.643
[breathing heavily]

02:47.123 --> 02:47.993
Who's there?

02:51.736 --> 02:52.737
[rustling]

02:56.132 --> 02:57.438
Oh, okay.

02:57.525 --> 02:59.091
I'm walking out
of this hell-hole,

02:59.179 --> 03:00.136
you understand me?

03:01.920 --> 03:03.400
Moss grows on the north side.

03:07.187 --> 03:08.405
You'll never get me.

03:10.451 --> 03:11.539
[softly] You'll never get me.

03:14.890 --> 03:16.457
[yells] You'll never get me!

03:21.418 --> 03:23.377
[theme music playing]

04:23.959 --> 04:25.482
Did you prep molecular biology?

04:25.569 --> 04:26.570
They're ready and waiting.

04:26.657 --> 04:28.050
You know they love a mystery.

04:29.138 --> 04:31.009
Not that it's any surprise,

04:31.096 --> 04:33.011
but you made it
from Marais to Atlanta
in record time.

04:33.098 --> 04:34.970
-Dr. Arcane...
-Hi.

04:35.057 --> 04:36.276
I need you to
rush this sample

04:36.363 --> 04:37.668
into sterilized isolation

04:37.755 --> 04:39.279
and start
preliminary labs.

04:39.366 --> 04:41.193
And, Caitlin,
full containment on this, okay?

04:41.281 --> 04:42.673
What the hell
are we dealing with, Abby?

04:42.760 --> 04:44.371
I don't know, but
it's all toxic and virulent,

04:44.458 --> 04:45.720
so please...

04:45.807 --> 04:46.808
watch yourself.

04:47.461 --> 04:48.462
On it.

04:56.731 --> 04:58.210
I need to assist.

04:58.298 --> 04:59.603
I need a decontamination suit,
and a work space.

04:59.690 --> 05:01.431
And maybe six cups less coffee.

05:01.518 --> 05:03.607
-This one is important.
-I get that.

05:03.694 --> 05:06.349
But even "the little engine
that could" needs a break
once in a while.

05:06.436 --> 05:08.090
I'm not that bad.

05:08.177 --> 05:10.397
But we both know
it's going to take hours
to run the labs.

05:10.484 --> 05:13.356
And you look like
you haven't slept in a week.

05:13.443 --> 05:14.618
Did I mention I missed you?

05:15.967 --> 05:17.708
Not yet, but I'll take that.

05:25.194 --> 05:28.284
Um... It's been a while.
There's some new faces.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.112
Not anyone I've seen
around the cafeteria,

05:30.199 --> 05:32.244
but the new assistant director
started while you were away.

05:32.332 --> 05:33.898
So you have that
to look forward to.

05:33.985 --> 05:35.335
How is she?

05:35.422 --> 05:36.771
She's right behind you.

05:36.858 --> 05:39.034
Dr. Arcane?

05:39.121 --> 05:40.427
I heard you were
on your way in.

05:40.514 --> 05:42.167
Dr. Palomer.

05:42.254 --> 05:43.734
I'm glad you're here.

05:43.821 --> 05:45.388
I've discovered
a dangerous new pathogen

05:45.475 --> 05:46.650
in the Marais swamp
and I'm--

05:46.737 --> 05:48.348
I know.

05:48.435 --> 05:50.001
Harlan forwarded your email.

05:50.567 --> 05:52.090
Oh.

05:52.177 --> 05:54.136
Which was the first word
the CDC has heard from you

05:54.223 --> 05:55.572
since you were left in Marais.

05:56.704 --> 05:58.706
What happened to daily reports?

05:58.793 --> 06:00.664
You must be aware
that I stayed on to monitor

06:00.751 --> 06:02.405
the green flu patients.

06:02.492 --> 06:04.712
All of whom have been released,
have they not?

06:06.148 --> 06:07.454
I understand.

06:07.541 --> 06:09.064
But... but I do have
reason to believe

06:09.151 --> 06:10.761
that this disease
is still active.

06:12.459 --> 06:13.634
Reason to believe?

06:14.678 --> 06:16.158
[Dr. Palomer sighs]

06:16.245 --> 06:19.770
I take a results-oriented
approach, Dr. Arcane.

06:19.857 --> 06:23.165
Have you observed
any new symptomatology?

06:23.252 --> 06:25.385
Can you show me
any fresh blood work,

06:25.472 --> 06:26.995
recent lab results?

06:29.084 --> 06:30.128
No, not yet.

06:30.215 --> 06:31.521
But the labs are coming back.

06:31.608 --> 06:33.001
Well...

06:33.088 --> 06:35.046
Then we'll have
a few things to discuss,

06:35.133 --> 06:37.135
especially given
what I've heard from Marais.

06:38.310 --> 06:39.834
Excuse me?

06:39.921 --> 06:41.401
I spoke with the hospital.

06:41.488 --> 06:43.751
They said
you've barely been there.

06:43.838 --> 06:46.057
You've been spending
days on end in the swamp.

06:47.015 --> 06:48.843
Look.

06:48.930 --> 06:50.453
We'll run the tests.

06:50.540 --> 06:51.889
But this is to be continued.

07:01.682 --> 07:02.987
[groans]

07:05.207 --> 07:06.991
[voices whispering]

07:13.128 --> 07:14.085
[groans]

07:15.826 --> 07:17.262
[breathing heavily]

07:17.349 --> 07:19.090
[Lucilia] I never thought
I would live to see

07:19.177 --> 07:22.224
the great Avery Sunderland
down on his knees.

07:23.617 --> 07:25.880
You know, I think
this ole swamp hates you

07:25.967 --> 07:27.316
even more than I do.

07:28.622 --> 07:30.319
Can't say that I blame it much.

07:30.406 --> 07:32.713
You have pissed
all over this place

07:32.800 --> 07:34.192
just to get what you want.

07:35.367 --> 07:37.674
You come to finish the job?

07:37.761 --> 07:40.416
Looks to me like
I don't have to.

07:40.503 --> 07:41.896
One hell of a trick
you pulled,

07:43.550 --> 07:44.942
telling my Matt
how you're his daddy,

07:45.029 --> 07:46.596
like you ever gave
a shit about him.

07:46.683 --> 07:48.685
You never gave me the chance.

07:48.772 --> 07:50.121
Because I was afraid.

07:51.166 --> 07:52.472
Of what?

07:52.559 --> 07:54.474
You would do
exactly what you did.

07:55.910 --> 07:59.087
That you would drag
him through the mud

07:59.174 --> 08:02.525
and turn him into a monster
just like you.

08:02.612 --> 08:04.135
How did it go so wrong
between us?

08:05.615 --> 08:06.834
I want you to know something.

08:07.922 --> 08:09.053
That no matter what happens,

08:11.403 --> 08:14.102
I'll always love you.

08:15.451 --> 08:17.801
It's a little late
for that now.

08:17.888 --> 08:19.542
It's never too late.

08:19.629 --> 08:20.630
We got the chance now,

08:20.717 --> 08:22.980
you and me... Lucilia, please!

08:23.067 --> 08:25.243
I'm just asking you
for a chance.

08:25.330 --> 08:26.854
[sobbing]

08:27.855 --> 08:29.857
Please. Lucilia, please.

08:31.162 --> 08:32.250
Goodbye, Avery.

08:32.337 --> 08:33.513
-[gun fires]
-[groans]

08:34.296 --> 08:35.253
[gun cocking]

08:36.603 --> 08:38.213
[panting]

08:42.739 --> 08:44.524
[rustling]

09:01.062 --> 09:02.411
[whimpering]

09:04.021 --> 09:04.979
Luce?

09:16.207 --> 09:18.427
[cell phone ringing]

09:26.174 --> 09:27.828
[sighs]

09:32.354 --> 09:33.398
[cell phone beeps]

09:47.717 --> 09:50.981
[Lucilia over voicemail]
Matt, where the hell are you?

09:51.068 --> 09:53.636
We talked about this.

09:53.723 --> 09:57.292
I know this hasn't been easy
on you, but I need you down
at the station today.

09:57.379 --> 09:58.467
Call me.

10:05.561 --> 10:06.823
[Abby] You didn't have
my back up there.

10:06.910 --> 10:08.303
You barely said a word.

10:08.390 --> 10:09.696
[Harlan] How am I
suppose to defend you

10:09.783 --> 10:11.741
when I have no idea
what's going on?

10:11.828 --> 10:14.222
It's not just no daily reports.

10:14.309 --> 10:16.224
It's not just paperwork.

10:16.311 --> 10:18.052
It's like you fell into
a black hole
over in that place.

10:18.139 --> 10:19.575
Okay, okay, I know
I should have called more.

10:19.662 --> 10:21.664
Okay, wait...
we've barely spoken in days.

10:23.057 --> 10:24.406
But swear to God,

10:24.493 --> 10:26.669
what little you did tell me,

10:26.756 --> 10:28.497
it didn't make much sense.

10:28.584 --> 10:30.151
So, so you agree with her now.

10:30.238 --> 10:32.153
I mean, she clearly thinks
I'm not doing my job--

10:32.240 --> 10:34.242
I didn't say that.

10:34.329 --> 10:36.244
But this radio silence
of yours...

10:38.550 --> 10:39.639
it's not like you.

10:41.684 --> 10:42.554
Or like us.

10:45.340 --> 10:46.733
What is it with you
and that town?

10:54.915 --> 10:56.133
Abby, stop.

10:56.220 --> 10:57.308
Where are you going?

10:58.962 --> 11:00.703
You're right,
the test will take hours.

11:00.790 --> 11:02.052
I, uh, I just need to think.

11:11.714 --> 11:13.977
[indistinct announcement]

11:18.286 --> 11:19.417
Dr. Woodrue.

11:20.854 --> 11:21.681
Ellery?

11:23.204 --> 11:26.424
I'm afraid I've no pecan pie
to offer you.

11:26.511 --> 11:28.862
I wanted to continue
our discussion of your work.

11:30.385 --> 11:31.255
Excuse me.

11:39.437 --> 11:42.876
Hardly ideal conditions
for research.

11:42.963 --> 11:45.400
It's like working
out of a high school cafeteria.

11:45.487 --> 11:47.707
And I'm not talking
about a magnet school.

11:48.795 --> 11:50.492
I assumed as much.

11:50.579 --> 11:52.320
It's why I've ordered
a fully equipped

11:52.407 --> 11:55.366
mobile biological lab
down from Chicago.

11:55.453 --> 11:57.542
And I've already spoken
with Mrs. Sunderland

11:57.629 --> 11:59.240
about which of their properties

11:59.327 --> 12:01.285
would be best suited
for continuing your research.

12:03.374 --> 12:08.815
There's an abandoned facility
on the outskirts of town.

12:08.902 --> 12:12.383
With your approval, we'll start
fitting it up immediately.

12:12.470 --> 12:14.603
I assumed your organization
would have

12:14.690 --> 12:18.346
dedicated laboratory facilities
already in place.

12:18.433 --> 12:24.395
A project of this...
delicate nature
requires... discretion.

12:25.614 --> 12:27.572
We prefer
to keep it off the books

12:27.659 --> 12:29.705
until we know exactly
what we're dealing with.

12:31.272 --> 12:32.360
[sighs]

12:32.447 --> 12:33.578
I'll take a look at it.

12:35.276 --> 12:36.973
I'm sure
you've missed something.

12:37.060 --> 12:40.542
Excellent. The conclave's
guiding principle, Dr. Woodrue,

12:40.629 --> 12:44.894
is to find the best
and then get out of their way.

12:44.981 --> 12:46.896
You'll have everything
you need ready

12:46.983 --> 12:48.419
when the specimen is located.

12:51.466 --> 12:52.772
How's that going, by the way?

12:56.253 --> 12:58.865
Well, I'm afraid
that the subject

12:58.952 --> 13:01.781
has been a challenge
to locate, but...

13:02.825 --> 13:04.348
it's only a matter of time.

13:05.219 --> 13:06.698
I agree.

13:06.786 --> 13:07.917
Only a matter of time.

13:20.538 --> 13:23.715
[panting]

13:34.944 --> 13:36.728
[voices whispering]

13:40.776 --> 13:41.603
Hey?

13:53.049 --> 13:54.181
Hey!

14:00.665 --> 14:01.971
[Burritt] Avery?

14:02.058 --> 14:03.581
You getting distracted again?

14:06.149 --> 14:07.194
No, Dad.

14:10.762 --> 14:11.720
I'm here.

14:13.200 --> 14:14.505
I'm, I'm here.

14:14.592 --> 14:16.507
Get 'er loaded, son.

14:16.594 --> 14:19.728
We make it to town
before the cafe closes,

14:19.815 --> 14:21.817
we'll get burgers to go.
[chuckles]

14:43.839 --> 14:45.406
What's going on, son?

14:45.493 --> 14:47.060
What's eating you?

14:47.147 --> 14:50.237
It's just this...
this particular tree.

14:50.324 --> 14:52.761
-People say it's got
special powers
-Special powers.

14:52.848 --> 14:53.805
[Avery]
Special powers.

14:53.893 --> 14:55.807
[chuckles]

14:55.895 --> 14:57.940
You know what's got
greater powers than a tree?

14:59.333 --> 15:00.290
An ax.

15:01.335 --> 15:02.292
No. Don't.

15:03.032 --> 15:05.208
[grunting]

15:05.295 --> 15:06.166
Be careful.

15:08.211 --> 15:09.169
Careful?

15:10.953 --> 15:12.302
Careful is for cowards.

15:14.087 --> 15:16.263
Yeah, I'm talking to you.

15:19.005 --> 15:23.139
[Burritt]  Thing is,
a man takes what he wants.

15:23.226 --> 15:25.054
A man looks out
for number one.

15:26.664 --> 15:27.622
Paying attention?

15:27.709 --> 15:28.623
[Avery] No, not again.

15:28.710 --> 15:30.320
Not again. Not again.

15:30.407 --> 15:31.365
No.

15:31.452 --> 15:32.366
Not again!

15:34.150 --> 15:35.021
Dad!

15:37.371 --> 15:38.415
[grunts]

15:38.502 --> 15:39.373
Dad?

15:40.200 --> 15:41.027
Dad!

15:41.114 --> 15:42.202
-Avery.
-Dad!

15:42.289 --> 15:44.247
-Avery.
-Dad!

15:44.334 --> 15:45.770
-Avery, Avery.
-Dad!

15:47.859 --> 15:49.122
Avery! Avery!

15:49.209 --> 15:51.254
Avery! [screaming]

15:51.341 --> 15:52.342
Avery!

15:52.429 --> 15:53.953
[screaming]

15:56.999 --> 16:00.350
[sobbing]

16:00.437 --> 16:01.961
[screaming continues]

16:24.548 --> 16:25.549
[sobs] Dad...

16:29.771 --> 16:32.992
-[sobbing]
-[wind blowing]

16:35.777 --> 16:36.865
[grunts]

16:39.999 --> 16:40.825
Oh, God.

16:56.232 --> 17:00.019
-[door opens]
-[sighs heavily]

17:49.111 --> 17:50.243
[knock on door]

17:55.378 --> 17:57.641
Veggie pizza and booze.

18:03.212 --> 18:05.084
[sighs] Only took
a deadly pathogen

18:05.171 --> 18:06.694
to bring
the band back together,

18:06.781 --> 18:09.740
but I won't take it personally.

18:09.827 --> 18:12.091
Where are they on that?

18:12.178 --> 18:13.918
They'll have a full analysis
by morning,

18:14.005 --> 18:15.616
just let 'em do their work.

18:17.357 --> 18:18.140
Yeah.

18:22.710 --> 18:23.537
So...

18:25.887 --> 18:27.149
this is different.

18:27.236 --> 18:28.194
[chuckles]

18:30.152 --> 18:32.850
Yeah. When I was little,

18:32.937 --> 18:35.984
I assumed that
the insides of the dolls
looked like the outsides.

18:36.071 --> 18:38.029
[chuckles]

18:38.117 --> 18:40.119
I know, so since they have
little hands and feet
and teeth,

18:40.206 --> 18:42.991
I thought that
if you looked inside
you'd find little organs...

18:43.078 --> 18:44.949
-Aww.
-...and a tiny blood stream.

18:45.036 --> 18:47.387
And little Dr. Arcane
just cut it open.

18:47.474 --> 18:49.302
I did. Yeah.
I was so disappointed.

18:49.389 --> 18:50.999
And yet you kept it around.

18:51.956 --> 18:52.827
Yeah.

18:54.089 --> 18:55.917
-To remember.
-Hmm.

18:56.004 --> 18:59.747
My mom, she didn't laugh much,
but she, she laughed that day.

19:01.749 --> 19:05.013
I've never heard you speak
about your mother.

19:05.100 --> 19:07.363
I always assumed it's because
you didn't remember her.

19:08.495 --> 19:10.410
Yeah, bits and pieces.

19:10.497 --> 19:11.976
You know, I was only eight
when she died.

19:14.022 --> 19:15.676
Earlier today you asked me

19:15.763 --> 19:17.504
what it was about Marais.

19:18.244 --> 19:19.288
Hmm.

19:19.375 --> 19:21.072
I'm beginning to wonder...

19:23.901 --> 19:26.426
whether or not
I came back for a reason.

19:30.517 --> 19:31.909
I have to tell you something.

19:34.303 --> 19:36.871
Okay.

19:36.958 --> 19:40.091
There is a man in the swamp
who is very, very sick.

19:41.005 --> 19:42.006
In the swamp?

19:42.093 --> 19:43.921
Yes.

19:44.008 --> 19:46.228
And I think it has something
to do with the green flu but...

19:47.273 --> 19:49.275
I've been protecting him,

19:49.362 --> 19:50.841
I've been trying
to find a cure,

19:50.928 --> 19:51.886
trying to find the answers,

19:51.973 --> 19:53.366
having no luck.

19:53.453 --> 19:54.280
So this...

19:56.369 --> 19:57.370
patient...

19:57.457 --> 19:59.807
Hmm.

19:59.894 --> 20:04.333
...is not in the hospital
or quarantine or included
in any of the reports because--

20:04.420 --> 20:07.075
Because he is more
than just a patient.

20:10.252 --> 20:11.906
I don't...
I don't know how to say this,

20:11.993 --> 20:12.994
but he's...

20:15.126 --> 20:17.433
he's been challenging
the way I look at the world.

20:19.087 --> 20:20.784
Does this miracle man
have a name?

20:22.699 --> 20:23.526
Yeah.

20:25.136 --> 20:26.573
Alec Holland.

20:36.974 --> 20:37.975
Ow!

20:52.033 --> 20:54.078
[breathing shakily]

20:54.688 --> 20:55.645
Oh, God.

20:59.606 --> 21:00.476
Ooh!

21:02.739 --> 21:03.610
Damn.

21:03.697 --> 21:06.177
[mumbles indistinctly]

21:08.267 --> 21:09.180
[Swamp Thing] Leave them.

21:10.138 --> 21:11.444
It's Spaghnum moss.

21:12.575 --> 21:14.185
It can help heal the wounds.

21:14.273 --> 21:15.274
Who's there?

21:19.103 --> 21:20.235
Who's there?

21:20.322 --> 21:21.149
What's happening?

21:21.236 --> 21:22.716
You told me once

21:22.803 --> 21:25.414
that if I kept spending
so much on boat gas

21:25.501 --> 21:27.286
you'd let me swim back
to the lab.

21:29.113 --> 21:30.245
[whispers] Holland.

21:32.856 --> 21:34.554
Is that you?

21:37.948 --> 21:39.210
What happened?

21:40.037 --> 21:41.212
I don't know.

21:43.127 --> 21:44.041
They said...

21:45.608 --> 21:47.218
They said that you died.
[stammers]

21:48.655 --> 21:51.353
Had some kind of an acc...
accident.

21:51.440 --> 21:53.137
You were shot.

21:53.224 --> 21:54.400
Who did this to you?

21:55.226 --> 21:56.837
People.

21:56.924 --> 21:58.578
People that I care about.

22:00.580 --> 22:03.060
And I thought cared about me.

22:03.147 --> 22:04.497
You're still not well.

22:05.933 --> 22:06.934
Well, you got that right.

22:07.021 --> 22:08.805
I'm pretty goddamn unwell.

22:09.850 --> 22:12.374
I been shot, nearly drowned

22:12.461 --> 22:16.683
and I've been having
these crazy visions.

22:16.770 --> 22:20.208
I... I think that
the swamp wants me dead.

22:20.295 --> 22:22.036
You hate this place.

22:22.123 --> 22:24.560
Oh, this place hates me,
this place is a killer.

22:24.647 --> 22:27.476
This place... It took my daddy
and it took...

22:28.912 --> 22:30.218
It took my little girl.

22:30.305 --> 22:33.264
But it's been damaged,
it's been abused.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.570
What are you talking about?

22:34.657 --> 22:36.093
The swamp is damaged
and abused?

22:36.180 --> 22:37.704
The swamp is a killer.

22:37.791 --> 22:40.315
The swamp is supposed
to be our livelihood.

22:40.402 --> 22:41.708
It's been put here for me.

22:41.795 --> 22:43.057
For Marais.

22:43.144 --> 22:46.277
It was, once.

22:46.365 --> 22:48.149
But after the abuse
it suffered,

22:48.236 --> 22:49.629
the balance here shifted,

22:49.716 --> 22:51.370
releasing a darkness.

22:53.807 --> 22:55.983
What are you talking about?

22:56.070 --> 22:58.464
What do you mean
by darkness?

22:58.551 --> 23:00.509
There's a force here, Avery.

23:00.596 --> 23:03.730
A "green" that connects me
to the plants and trees.

23:03.817 --> 23:05.688
It told me you were here.

23:06.950 --> 23:08.125
It told you?

23:08.212 --> 23:09.736
I think the green saved me,

23:11.085 --> 23:12.565
made me this way

23:12.652 --> 23:14.088
to restore the balance,

23:15.176 --> 23:16.786
and to protect the swamp

23:18.005 --> 23:20.050
from people just like you.

23:21.008 --> 23:22.488
No, no, no.

23:22.575 --> 23:24.751
Whoa! No, no, no.
Holland, no.
Holland.

23:24.838 --> 23:27.449
You know, I have you to thank
for what I've become, Avery.

23:27.536 --> 23:28.407
Me?

23:28.494 --> 23:29.582
You and the others.

23:29.669 --> 23:30.670
No!

23:30.757 --> 23:34.151
Taking and taking and taking.

23:34.238 --> 23:36.980
Help! Holland, No. No!

23:44.074 --> 23:45.032
You see this?

23:46.816 --> 23:49.340
Feeling all right, buddy?

23:49.428 --> 23:52.387
Just a little under
the weather, I'll be fine.

23:52.474 --> 23:53.736
I was wondering if you
had a chance
to sign off

23:53.823 --> 23:55.564
on that accident report
I gave you.

23:55.651 --> 23:57.479
The, uh, collision down
on County 9.

23:57.566 --> 24:00.003
Look, I haven't
gotten to it yet.

24:00.090 --> 24:02.353
All right. Well, the insurance
company called again,
they're just wanting to know--

24:02.441 --> 24:03.442
Look. I said I'll get to it.

24:03.529 --> 24:04.834
[Lucilia] Matt.

24:04.921 --> 24:05.835
May I see you
for a moment, please?

24:17.586 --> 24:19.240
What was that all about?

24:19.327 --> 24:20.459
That was a pain in the ass.

24:22.243 --> 24:23.723
I know that you're hurting,

24:23.810 --> 24:26.900
but right now
you need to keep it together.

24:26.987 --> 24:28.728
It won't be long
before people start to notice

24:28.815 --> 24:30.512
that Avery's gone AWOL.

24:30.599 --> 24:32.471
And?

24:32.558 --> 24:34.690
Maria Sunderland
can play dumb for a while,

24:34.777 --> 24:36.823
but sooner or later
there are gonna be questions.

24:36.910 --> 24:39.173
The last thing we need
is for you going off the rails

24:39.260 --> 24:41.262
the day after he disappeared.

24:41.349 --> 24:43.525
Well, lucky for us,
we got all the answers.

24:44.613 --> 24:45.875
Being with the police and all.

24:46.659 --> 24:47.486
Matt.

24:49.096 --> 24:51.359
We're gonna get through this,
okay?

24:51.446 --> 24:53.274
We're gonna get through it.

24:53.361 --> 24:54.667
You even still think about him?

24:55.972 --> 24:57.321
My father?

24:57.408 --> 24:59.585
[scoffs] Oh, Jesus.

24:59.672 --> 25:01.412
-After what Avery did to you--
-No, not Avery.

25:02.283 --> 25:04.459
My father.

25:04.546 --> 25:06.679
The man who actually raised me
until he left

25:06.766 --> 25:08.463
because you couldn't
let Sunderland go.

25:11.858 --> 25:13.686
Matt...

25:13.773 --> 25:16.732
I swear,
I never meant to hurt him...

25:17.733 --> 25:18.560
or you.

25:18.647 --> 25:19.518
[scoffs]

25:24.131 --> 25:25.524
I'd better get back to work.

25:27.351 --> 25:32.095
[door opens and shuts]

25:32.182 --> 25:35.490
[Harlan]
So you're saying Alec
is like, what?

25:35.577 --> 25:37.231
-Transformed?
-Mmm-hmm.

25:39.320 --> 25:42.802
[stammers]
It's hard to explain.
It's...

25:48.155 --> 25:49.678
He can control plants.

25:50.766 --> 25:52.028
He can make them grow,

25:52.115 --> 25:54.030
he can make them do
whatever he wants.

25:54.117 --> 25:56.598
He can access memories
from the past.

25:56.685 --> 25:58.687
He can bring up
memories of things

25:58.774 --> 26:00.123
that have happened
in the swamp.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.299
Okay, so this is Alec Holland.
Right?

26:02.386 --> 26:04.606
The guy we saw
when we first arrived.

26:04.693 --> 26:07.000
The, the guy who was blown up.

26:07.087 --> 26:09.350
I know. I know you're thinking

26:09.437 --> 26:11.395
professional help. I, I get it.

26:11.482 --> 26:13.441
I would too...

26:13.528 --> 26:15.269
-if I hadn't seen what
had happened myself.
-Hey, hey, hey.

26:16.487 --> 26:18.272
I was with you in Marais,
remember?

26:18.359 --> 26:20.230
Mmm-hmm.

26:20.317 --> 26:23.756
I mean, I saw a man with a tree
growing out of him, like...

26:23.843 --> 26:26.410
And if you recall it,
I had some pretty odd
symptoms myself.

26:28.456 --> 26:29.892
Does that mean you believe me?

26:31.067 --> 26:32.591
Always and forever.

26:35.506 --> 26:37.117
And the hell with Palomer.

26:37.204 --> 26:39.728
[both chuckling]

26:39.815 --> 26:41.034
She comes at you tomorrow,

26:41.121 --> 26:42.383
she'll have
to get through me first.

26:46.866 --> 26:48.041
Thanks, Harlan.

26:51.087 --> 26:53.394
And for whatever it's worth...
[sighs]

26:53.481 --> 26:54.613
I haven't seen you
so passionate

26:54.700 --> 26:56.484
about someone in a long time.

26:57.877 --> 26:58.878
He's worth it.

27:01.010 --> 27:02.185
It shows.

27:04.492 --> 27:06.320
I missed you.

27:06.407 --> 27:08.627
Oh, God, I missed you, too.

27:08.714 --> 27:10.541
[both chuckling]

27:11.934 --> 27:13.196
Good night, Harlan.

27:13.283 --> 27:15.024
Get some sleep.

27:15.111 --> 27:16.156
The lab results should be in
first thing in the morning.

27:27.558 --> 27:29.343
Dr. Edwards?

27:29.430 --> 27:31.780
It's 1:00 in the morning.
Who are you?

27:31.867 --> 27:33.782
I need you to get
in the car, sir.

27:33.869 --> 27:34.914
Man, bullshit.

27:35.001 --> 27:36.480
Get in the goddamn car.

27:49.450 --> 27:50.494
[tires screech]

27:56.718 --> 27:59.068
[Avery]
I've never took anything
from you, Holland.

28:00.243 --> 28:01.854
I helped you

28:01.941 --> 28:04.378
to resume you work.

28:04.465 --> 28:08.164
To regain your reputation,
you remember that.

28:08.251 --> 28:09.600
I've lost all that now.

28:11.254 --> 28:12.038
I've lost her.

28:12.952 --> 28:13.953
Her?

28:16.042 --> 28:16.999
What do you mean?

28:19.523 --> 28:21.003
Are you talking about

28:21.090 --> 28:23.484
Dr. Arcane?

28:23.571 --> 28:26.530
She's known about you
for quite a while, hasn't she?

28:26.617 --> 28:29.403
She brought that sample back
to study and I think that...

28:30.534 --> 28:32.362
that sample came from you.

28:33.233 --> 28:34.625
[growls]

28:35.757 --> 28:37.541
That's true, isn't it?

28:37.628 --> 28:38.760
[growls softly]

28:40.327 --> 28:43.069
She's been trying
to find a cure for you.

28:46.637 --> 28:49.118
She is a friend.

28:49.205 --> 28:51.730
And I'll bet
she's moving heaven and earth

28:51.817 --> 28:53.427
to make you better.

28:55.124 --> 28:57.126
Because she cares about you.

28:59.128 --> 29:00.521
And you care for her.

29:01.565 --> 29:02.741
Don't you?

29:05.004 --> 29:06.092
Listen to me, Holland.

29:07.658 --> 29:09.356
I want to...

29:09.443 --> 29:11.053
I want to tell you
something now.

29:11.140 --> 29:13.752
I know this must be hard
for you up here, but...

29:16.102 --> 29:18.191
my daddy always
used to say to me,

29:18.278 --> 29:21.542
"A man...
takes what he wants."

29:22.891 --> 29:24.458
Now I know

29:24.545 --> 29:26.634
that you don't want
to just hide out up in here

29:26.721 --> 29:29.158
in this green hell forever--

29:29.245 --> 29:32.031
[yells] Do you think
that I wanted this?

29:32.118 --> 29:34.860
No, I don't think
that you wanted it.

29:34.947 --> 29:38.777
I think that you want to be
Alec Holland again.

29:38.864 --> 29:42.258
And I think
that you want to be with Abby.

29:42.345 --> 29:43.694
And I think, Holland...

29:46.045 --> 29:47.220
I might be able to help you.

29:49.265 --> 29:51.485
What can you do?

29:51.572 --> 29:56.011
Not me. There's a scientist
who works for me
and his name is Jason Woodrue.

29:56.098 --> 29:57.665
He's a little bit odd,

29:57.752 --> 29:59.449
but he's brilliant.

29:59.536 --> 30:01.277
I've heard of him.

30:01.364 --> 30:04.498
Abby thinks
very highly of him, too.

30:04.585 --> 30:06.065
That's why
she brought the sample

30:06.152 --> 30:07.762
to him to study.

30:07.849 --> 30:09.938
You know,
he's extremely well respected,

30:10.025 --> 30:12.071
an expert in his field

30:12.158 --> 30:14.073
and that's why
I brought him down here

30:14.160 --> 30:18.077
to study what the hell
is going on here in the swamp.

30:18.164 --> 30:19.861
The mutagens.

30:19.948 --> 30:21.863
Mutagens, yes.

30:21.950 --> 30:23.604
And I know
what that word means.

30:23.691 --> 30:26.650
That's, that's how
things change, right?

30:26.737 --> 30:28.348
That's what he studies.

30:29.436 --> 30:31.090
How things change.

30:31.177 --> 30:34.093
And that means he studies
how to change things back.

30:35.224 --> 30:36.617
-[growls]
-[gasps]

30:36.704 --> 30:37.966
You need to go.

30:38.053 --> 30:40.273
What... [stammering]

30:40.360 --> 30:41.361
Go to the window.

30:42.492 --> 30:43.580
What for?

30:45.756 --> 30:46.757
A boat's coming.

30:48.629 --> 30:49.891
How the hell do you know that?

30:53.199 --> 30:54.591
The green told you

30:54.678 --> 30:55.636
the boat was coming?

30:55.723 --> 30:57.551
The green brought it here.

30:57.638 --> 30:59.640
Vines rose up,
blocked the channel,

30:59.727 --> 31:01.947
turned the boat
in this direction.

31:02.034 --> 31:03.862
You brought a boat?
[chuckles]

31:05.211 --> 31:06.777
The swamp
would have let you die...

31:09.302 --> 31:10.259
I couldn't.

31:14.089 --> 31:14.960
I don't see it.

31:16.396 --> 31:18.180
Yeah, well, look at that.

31:19.790 --> 31:23.403
You did... Here it come.
[laughs]

31:23.490 --> 31:24.404
I'll be...

31:25.318 --> 31:26.319
Hey!

31:28.103 --> 31:29.061
Holland.

31:30.889 --> 31:33.239
Listen, I'm going to come
back tomorrow, okay?

31:33.326 --> 31:35.806
And I'm going to bring Woodrue.

31:35.894 --> 31:37.852
And I want you to meet us.
There's a...

31:37.939 --> 31:40.333
There's... There's a clearing
just beyond the channel.

31:40.420 --> 31:41.769
You know where that is?

31:41.856 --> 31:43.292
And if you do this,

31:43.379 --> 31:44.685
there's a chance

31:44.772 --> 31:46.295
that you can be
a normal man again.

31:46.382 --> 31:48.210
That maybe you can
walk down the street again,

31:48.297 --> 31:50.169
and maybe you can sleep
in a bed again.

31:50.256 --> 31:52.780
And that you might even
be able to...

31:52.867 --> 31:54.956
when the right song
comes on,

31:55.043 --> 31:56.044
ask a woman

31:57.350 --> 31:58.786
for the next dance, you know.

32:00.135 --> 32:01.658
You saved my life, Holland.

32:02.833 --> 32:04.357
Let me save yours.

32:04.444 --> 32:06.011
[boat engine chugging]

32:07.577 --> 32:08.622
[chuckles nervously]

32:11.364 --> 32:12.147
Holland?

32:13.540 --> 32:15.324
-[digital beeps]
-[elevator dings]

32:24.507 --> 32:26.596
[Dr. Palomer clears throat]

32:26.683 --> 32:28.337
Well, what's going on?
Why isn't my card working?

32:28.424 --> 32:29.599
The sample you brought in,

32:29.686 --> 32:32.602
it's been placed
on full lockdown.

32:32.689 --> 32:34.082
I need to see
the results of the analysis.

32:34.169 --> 32:36.432
No, Dr. Arcane, you don't.

32:36.519 --> 32:37.433
Come with me.

32:39.044 --> 32:40.001
[elevator dings]

32:42.569 --> 32:43.700
Where's Harlan?

32:43.787 --> 32:45.006
Harlan's been reassigned.

32:45.920 --> 32:47.313
What?

32:47.400 --> 32:49.054
There's been an outbreak
of dengue in Bangladesh.

32:49.141 --> 32:50.664
His flight left at 5:00
this morning.

32:51.970 --> 32:53.623
It was out of my hands, Doctor.

32:55.190 --> 32:56.278
Where're we going?

33:01.631 --> 33:02.502
Hi.

33:05.026 --> 33:06.027
Dr. Palomer.

33:06.636 --> 33:07.637
[sighs]

33:09.596 --> 33:11.032
Well, what's going on?

33:11.119 --> 33:12.338
What the hell is this?

33:15.689 --> 33:18.953
Dr. Arcane,
please, take a seat.

33:19.040 --> 33:21.216
Uh, not until I know
what this is about.

33:21.303 --> 33:23.871
Of course, of course.

33:23.958 --> 33:26.308
We're here to discuss
one of your patients.

33:26.395 --> 33:27.179
Okay.

33:27.918 --> 33:30.095
An Alec Holland.

33:33.402 --> 33:35.578
I don't...
I don't have a patient
named Alec Holland.

33:35.665 --> 33:36.971
Before you interject,

33:38.016 --> 33:39.321
we know he's still alive

33:39.408 --> 33:42.759
and we're fully aware
of his condition.

33:42.846 --> 33:45.110
Dr. Edwards was very concerned

33:45.197 --> 33:47.895
after your conversation
last night and--

33:47.982 --> 33:49.940
What, how do you know...
Where is Harlan--

33:50.028 --> 33:54.423
Doctor, how we learned
about this man isn't important.

33:54.510 --> 33:56.512
The fact remains
that you've been treating

33:56.599 --> 34:00.951
a possibly infectious patient
totally off the medical radar.

34:01.039 --> 34:03.041
He needs to be brought in
for treatment

34:03.128 --> 34:05.565
for the safety
of the surrounding community.

34:05.652 --> 34:06.914
He is not a threat.

34:09.177 --> 34:12.050
That is not for you to decide.

34:13.312 --> 34:14.748
Or him, either.

34:14.835 --> 34:18.273
Where you can be useful,
Dr. Arcane,

34:18.360 --> 34:22.886
is in helping us defuse
a potentially harmful scenario.

34:24.323 --> 34:25.759
What do you mean?

34:25.846 --> 34:29.023
If Alec Holland,
or what he's become,

34:29.110 --> 34:33.245
has to be
brought in using force,
things could get violent.

34:34.115 --> 34:35.899
Now, he trusts you

34:35.986 --> 34:38.293
and you could make him see

34:38.380 --> 34:41.253
that this is all
for his own good.

34:43.472 --> 34:44.430
Who are you?

34:46.736 --> 34:50.175
Someone who values
your relationship
with Dr. Holland

34:50.262 --> 34:52.568
and believes that you can help

34:52.655 --> 34:56.442
both him and yourself
by cooperating.

34:58.531 --> 35:01.142
I've work to do in Marais.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.623
Well, no one's
stopping you, Dr. Arcane.

35:03.710 --> 35:05.277
I'm not asking for permission.

35:06.843 --> 35:08.236
Stay the fuck away from Alec.

35:09.455 --> 35:10.412
[door slams]

35:13.502 --> 35:14.808
Harlan.

35:14.895 --> 35:16.897
Please tell me
you're all right.

35:16.984 --> 35:18.203
I have to go back to Marais.

35:18.290 --> 35:20.640
Call me, please,
as soon as you get this.

35:23.686 --> 35:24.818
[knocking at door]

35:30.824 --> 35:31.738
Mr. Sunderland.

35:33.392 --> 35:35.350
You've been in some
sort of accident?

35:35.437 --> 35:37.657
I'm not in the mood
for questions, Woodrue.

35:37.744 --> 35:39.224
Got a medical bag in here?

35:39.311 --> 35:40.703
Some kind of antibiotics?

35:42.270 --> 35:43.619
What?

35:43.706 --> 35:46.448
I know that you don't practice,
but...

35:46.535 --> 35:50.583
-You must have MD
in there somewhere...
-In my bag.

35:50.670 --> 35:52.150
...with all
those fancy letters.

35:53.934 --> 35:56.066
Surely you can treat
a couple of simple wounds.

36:00.636 --> 36:02.116
I'll leave you two alone.

36:05.119 --> 36:06.512
Mrs. Woodrue?

36:08.470 --> 36:11.081
Shouldn't you be doing this
in your house?

36:11.169 --> 36:13.040
What did I say
about asking questions?

36:17.914 --> 36:19.786
I want you to look at this.

36:21.048 --> 36:22.354
I got shot.

36:28.098 --> 36:29.709
These wounds are very strange.

36:29.796 --> 36:31.189
Yeah...

36:34.061 --> 36:36.281
With apologies for
yet another query...

36:36.368 --> 36:37.369
um...

36:38.370 --> 36:39.458
where have you been?

36:41.416 --> 36:42.591
I've been in the swamp.

36:44.332 --> 36:46.247
Where I found the source

36:46.334 --> 36:48.858
of those cells
that make you so happy.

36:49.859 --> 36:51.426
Oh.

36:51.513 --> 36:53.428
Now you go ahead and you clean,
clean these good,

36:53.515 --> 36:55.387
'cause I don't care
if it hurts.

36:56.126 --> 36:57.650
The source.

36:57.737 --> 36:59.782
It's not an animal.

36:59.869 --> 37:01.349
It's a scientist
who worked here

37:01.436 --> 37:03.395
before you came.

37:03.482 --> 37:08.965
And he's completely covered
in some kind of
crazy plant skin.

37:09.966 --> 37:11.751
He's barely human.

37:11.838 --> 37:13.492
You know, I think that...

37:13.579 --> 37:15.537
I think that he somehow...

37:15.624 --> 37:17.322
miraculously healed me.

37:20.150 --> 37:22.283
You're right, Alec Holland

37:22.370 --> 37:25.373
did almost completely
heal you.

37:26.635 --> 37:28.202
I didn't say it was Holland.

37:30.030 --> 37:31.814
I didn't say anything
about Holland,
how did you--

37:31.901 --> 37:33.381
Nathan Ellery's
been following up.

37:36.341 --> 37:37.646
Your chief investor.

37:37.733 --> 37:40.170
My chief investor,
who I haven't met.

37:40.258 --> 37:45.263
Well, Maria took the meeting...
I, um... I assumed
that you knew.

37:47.308 --> 37:50.137
She showed them my work
while you were away

37:50.224 --> 37:53.096
and suggested that you...

37:53.183 --> 37:56.970
[chuckles] had left the project
in her able hands.

37:57.057 --> 38:01.104
She has always been
a smart one, my Maria.

38:02.454 --> 38:03.672
Well, regardless...

38:07.197 --> 38:11.027
They are eager to see more.

38:13.073 --> 38:16.206
Ellery set me up
with a brand-new facility.

38:16.294 --> 38:19.775
Assistants, I assume
are somewhat vaguely competent,

38:19.862 --> 38:24.824
and he's obtained an impressive
amount of information
on Holland already.

38:24.911 --> 38:27.087
Well,
thought of everything, huh?

38:27.174 --> 38:28.436
Yeah.

38:28.523 --> 38:33.049
He's, uh...
he's even offered...

38:33.136 --> 38:36.662
personnel to aid in bringing
the subject in for study, so...

38:36.749 --> 38:39.273
Let me ask you something,
Woodrue.

38:40.709 --> 38:45.540
Do you think it's possible
to cure Holland?

38:45.627 --> 38:48.717
To bring him back
to the man he once was?

38:50.676 --> 38:55.289
Do you want to cure the goose
of laying golden eggs?

38:55.376 --> 38:58.379
What? What the hell
are you talking about?

38:58.466 --> 38:59.989
Alec Holland...

39:01.426 --> 39:03.297
normal man...

39:06.039 --> 39:09.651
is very unlikely
to produce regenerative cells.

39:11.479 --> 39:12.915
[hesitantly] Yeah.

39:15.309 --> 39:20.706
Think of what we...
Think of what you
would accomplish.

39:23.186 --> 39:25.667
The secrets
of cell regeneration...

39:28.104 --> 39:29.367
Avery...

39:30.672 --> 39:33.327
you could cheat death.

39:33.414 --> 39:36.461
You could cure
all sorts of disease and...

39:38.724 --> 39:42.902
This wouldn't... This wouldn't
just make you
into a billionaire.

39:42.989 --> 39:46.209
I mean, there are
plenty of billionaires
that no one's ever heard of,

39:46.296 --> 39:50.475
but you, your name
would be everywhere.

39:52.215 --> 39:53.913
You could change the world.

39:57.264 --> 39:58.918
That man saved my life.

40:00.702 --> 40:01.834
Yes, indeed.

40:04.837 --> 40:05.707
Hmm.

40:09.363 --> 40:12.410
I suggest that we let him
save millions more.

40:24.900 --> 40:25.684
[Avery] Holland?

40:30.253 --> 40:31.254
You out here?

40:35.998 --> 40:36.999
Holland?

40:38.174 --> 40:39.828
[Jason] Alec Holland?

40:39.915 --> 40:41.308
It's Avery Sunderland.

40:45.094 --> 40:46.835
[Jason]
This is Jason Woodrue.

40:49.403 --> 40:52.624
Maybe you're familiar
with some of my work.

40:52.711 --> 40:53.842
[Swamp Thing]
I've read your work.

40:56.932 --> 40:58.456
[Avery] I didn't think
you were gonna show up.

40:59.761 --> 41:03.025
Any...
particular piece of mine?

41:04.636 --> 41:07.377
The  Journal
of Molecular Biology.

41:07.465 --> 41:09.379
The use of transgenic DNA to--

41:09.467 --> 41:11.773
Create new plant forms. Yes.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.038
The transformation...

41:17.475 --> 41:20.129
intrigues me.

41:20.216 --> 41:22.523
Cells dividing, growing, dying.

41:25.439 --> 41:27.223
It's the essence of truth.

41:27.310 --> 41:28.355
Yes.

41:28.442 --> 41:29.748
But can you go back?

41:29.835 --> 41:31.880
Can you make me
an ordinary man?

41:34.274 --> 41:36.624
It's a shame.

41:36.711 --> 41:39.975
There's so much ordinary
in the world already.

41:42.238 --> 41:43.196
But I...

41:44.284 --> 41:45.894
But I can try.

41:45.981 --> 41:49.115
But we'll have to
bring you back to my facility.

41:49.202 --> 41:50.725
No!

41:50.812 --> 41:52.335
No, I can't leave this place.

41:54.207 --> 41:56.514
We have great work to do,
Holland.

41:57.993 --> 42:00.126
Now don't turn away from it.

42:00.213 --> 42:01.780
It's the only way.

42:05.435 --> 42:06.611
Who else is here with you?

42:09.657 --> 42:11.877
Don't, just... hold on.

42:12.965 --> 42:14.053
Holland.

42:14.140 --> 42:16.055
[leaves rustling]

42:31.374 --> 42:33.638
[man 1] Jesus Christ.

42:33.725 --> 42:35.030
[man 2] Watch yourselves.

42:40.819 --> 42:41.907
[man 3 over radio]  Move in.

42:54.789 --> 42:55.703
Go away.

42:57.139 --> 42:59.881
Leave now while you can.

42:59.968 --> 43:01.796
-[man 1] Watch it. Watch it.
-[man 2] Hit him
with the nitro.

43:01.883 --> 43:02.754
Fire!

43:04.233 --> 43:07.236
-[Swamp Thing growls]
-[men screaming]

43:11.458 --> 43:14.156
[screaming continues]

43:14.243 --> 43:17.072
-[man 1] Look out!
-[screaming]

43:18.291 --> 43:19.118
[grunts loudly]

43:22.121 --> 43:23.122
[screaming]

43:25.298 --> 43:27.517
[groans loudly]

43:27.605 --> 43:29.868
-[woman] Where is he?
-[man 2] Where'd he go?

43:31.304 --> 43:32.914
Where are
the fucking trees?

43:35.525 --> 43:37.440
[man 4] Hold your fire.
Hold your fire.

43:38.920 --> 43:39.921
[Avery] Hey!

43:41.140 --> 43:42.271
What the hell?

43:44.534 --> 43:46.580
-I said no!
-[screaming]

43:48.147 --> 43:49.104
Holland!

43:52.804 --> 43:53.848
[growls]

43:57.373 --> 43:59.637
What are you waiting for?
That's just slowed him--

44:00.376 --> 44:01.334
Hose him!

44:19.221 --> 44:20.353
Okay.

44:21.397 --> 44:22.442
Okay.

44:25.793 --> 44:26.794
[Abby] Alec?

44:27.839 --> 44:28.709
Alec?

44:30.145 --> 44:31.103
Alec!

44:50.557 --> 44:51.558
[exhales]

44:54.169 --> 44:55.083
