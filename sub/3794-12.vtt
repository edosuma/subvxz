01:36.579 --> 01:38.647
- really?
- is it that unbelievable?

01:38.681 --> 01:40.315
No, i just thought

01:40.350 --> 01:43.185
He's over her.
guy got back on the horse
and performed like a man.

01:43.219 --> 01:45.120
- i'm impressed.
- how are things going
with you?

01:45.154 --> 01:47.189
Well, sloan agreed
to have lunch with me.

01:47.223 --> 01:49.257
Where evil will perform

01:49.292 --> 01:51.426

01:51.461 --> 01:53.428
I'm gonna tell her i want

01:53.463 --> 01:54.896
You've said that before,
haven't you?

01:54.931 --> 01:56.898
- you don't think it'll work?
- no.

01:56.933 --> 01:59.634
I don't really want
relationship advice from
you anyway, drama.

01:59.669 --> 02:01.670
I'm not really giving you
relationship advice, e,

02:01.671 --> 02:04.306
'cause you and sloan don't
really have a relationship.

02:04.340 --> 02:07.609
But embrace it,
because freedom is
a beautiful thing.

02:07.643 --> 02:10.245
- and now we all have it.
- yeah, well, i don't want it.

02:10.279 --> 02:12.180
I didn't want it either.
it was forced upon me.

02:12.215 --> 02:15.317
You guys are pathetic.

02:21.090 --> 02:24.126
Freedom, baby.

t-shirts made up.

02:24.160 --> 02:26.461

a little break.
- ( phone ringing )

02:26.496 --> 02:29.064
Oh, miss u.c.l.a.

You go, girl.

02:32.702 --> 02:33.969
<i>- hey.
- hey.</i>

02:34.003 --> 02:36.038
Look, this may be
a little direct,

02:36.072 --> 02:39.141
But i'm feeling really insecure
that you didn't even try
and kiss me last night.

02:39.175 --> 02:41.676
I didn't want
to be aggressive.

02:41.711 --> 02:43.912
<i>- i like aggressive, turtle.
- i can see that.</i>

02:43.946 --> 02:46.114

02:46.149 --> 02:47.916
<i>yeah, unless you're busy.</i>

02:47.950 --> 02:49.951
No, i'm not busy.
it's just...

02:49.986 --> 02:51.987
<i>- jamie?
- yeah.</i>

02:52.021 --> 02:55.157
I will help you get
over jamie, turtle.

02:55.191 --> 02:56.892
<i>- you think?
- i know.</i>

02:56.926 --> 02:58.660
Even if we just talk.

02:58.695 --> 03:00.762
All right.

03:00.797 --> 03:03.231
I'm just saying no amount
of ivy gimlets

03:03.299 --> 03:05.233

fall back in love with you.

03:05.268 --> 03:07.803

03:07.837 --> 03:10.138

03:10.173 --> 03:12.274
- learn from it.
- later, boys.

03:12.308 --> 03:13.642
- later.
- enjoy.

03:13.676 --> 03:15.110
Look, e,
i agree with johnny.

03:15.144 --> 03:16.445
What's a lunch
going to accomplish?

03:16.479 --> 03:18.246
I'm gonna make it special.

03:18.281 --> 03:19.881
How are you gonna
make lunch special?

03:19.916 --> 03:21.183
<i>i've got some ideas.</i>

03:21.217 --> 03:23.051
You're gonna need
some roofies, bro.

03:23.086 --> 03:24.519
( stifled laugh )

03:24.554 --> 03:26.088
So what are we here
to talk about?

03:26.155 --> 03:28.457
Well, this is
extremely secretive.

03:28.491 --> 03:30.025
Everything in here is.

03:31.260 --> 03:33.195
I'm buying
a very big company.

03:33.229 --> 03:35.263
Oh, congrats.

03:35.264 --> 03:36.865
Which he said wouldn't
cost us anything.

03:36.899 --> 03:39.401
This deal will make me
the head of the largest agency

03:39.435 --> 03:41.503
In the entire
entertainment business.

03:41.537 --> 03:43.305
You said it wouldn't
cost us anything.

03:43.339 --> 03:44.773
Well, i didn't think
that it would.

03:44.774 --> 03:46.708
He said the company
was gonna buy it.

03:46.743 --> 03:48.477
<i>i thought that
the company could.</i>

03:48.511 --> 03:50.245
But it's been a rough
year so, you know,

03:50.279 --> 03:51.947
We're a little
strapped for cash.

03:51.981 --> 03:54.649
But the bank has
asked me to personally
guarantee something.

03:54.684 --> 03:56.151
$12 million.

03:56.185 --> 03:57.686
I think it's great
that you two have

03:57.720 --> 03:59.654
Such open communication
about your money.

03:59.689 --> 04:01.023
It's not our money.

04:01.057 --> 04:03.291
- it's her money.
- oh.

04:03.359 --> 04:06.261
And i just put up
my money when we started
this new agency.

04:06.295 --> 04:07.696
And that was over
two years ago,

04:07.730 --> 04:09.731
And we still haven't gotten
all of that money back yet.

04:09.766 --> 04:11.400
And that doesn't
concern you, ari?

04:11.434 --> 04:13.769
No, because we're gonna
make it back 50 times

04:13.803 --> 04:15.237
- on this one.
- ( laughs )

04:15.271 --> 04:16.538
You don't see it this way?

04:16.572 --> 04:19.173
Even if i did, i don't see
this as just about business.

04:19.208 --> 04:21.309
Is it about ego, ari?

04:21.310 --> 04:23.145
Well, i've always dreamed
about ruling the world.

04:23.212 --> 04:26.114
But now that i'm getting
older i would settle for
ruling hollywood.

04:26.149 --> 04:29.084
It goes much deeper than that.
he's got enemies at this
company he wants to buy.

04:29.118 --> 04:31.620
<i>- i have enemies everywhere.
- who are these enemies?</i>

04:31.654 --> 04:34.056
These are very
personal conflicts.
he wants payback.

04:34.090 --> 04:36.525
- and i'm not sure
he's thinking clearly.
- what?

04:36.559 --> 04:38.093
<i>tell me about
these conflicts, ari.</i>

04:38.127 --> 04:40.996
- they don't matter.
- your wife seems
to think they do.

04:41.030 --> 04:43.065
My wife doesn't know
how i do my business.

04:43.099 --> 04:46.134
But you need her money
in order to buy this
business that you want.

04:46.169 --> 04:48.236
<i>- so why do you want it?
- for revenge.</i>

04:48.271 --> 04:50.806
- for a music department.
- for terrance.

04:50.840 --> 04:53.775
For a book department
that i can pair with
filmmakers.

04:53.810 --> 04:56.011
- and for lloyd.
- for spts stars.

04:56.045 --> 04:58.980
Is it possible that
these people are the reason
you want to buy the agency?

04:59.015 --> 05:00.682
Yes, he wants
to destroy them.

05:00.750 --> 05:02.150
Tell her.
tell her.

05:02.185 --> 05:05.020
Is it true?
do you want to destroy
these people, ari?

05:05.088 --> 05:05.620
Okay, yes!

05:06.823 --> 05:11.593
S!if i could gouge out
terrance mcquiewick's
eyeballs

05:11.627 --> 05:15.330
And eat them for what
he did to me, i would.

05:15.365 --> 05:18.400
And i would sell that
benedict arnold adam davies

05:18.401 --> 05:22.070
Into white slavery
if we lived in a place
that had a market for it.

05:22.105 --> 05:24.873
And lloyd,
that little queen

05:24.907 --> 05:27.642
Who i welcomed
into my home

05:27.677 --> 05:31.380
And allowed to
play with my children
and care for my dog,

05:31.414 --> 05:33.749
And who left me
for those two scumbags,

05:33.816 --> 05:35.917
I would tie him up
and allow the entire

05:35.952 --> 05:38.420
Screen actors guild
to anally rape him

05:38.488 --> 05:40.555
If not for the fact that
i know he would enjoy it.

05:40.590 --> 05:42.090
I hate 'em all.

05:42.125 --> 05:44.826
And yes, i want to see
them destroyed.

05:44.861 --> 05:47.496
But that is not why
i want this company.

05:47.530 --> 05:50.665
I want--
no no, i need

05:50.700 --> 05:54.336
This company because
it's good business.

05:54.370 --> 05:57.472
It's good
goddamn business.

05:57.507 --> 06:00.242
And if i don't buy it,
someone else will

06:00.276 --> 06:04.046
And that will be very
very bad for my business.

06:04.080 --> 06:07.516
And my wife, of all people,
should know

06:07.550 --> 06:11.186
That when it comes
to business, my judgment
is never clouded.

06:11.220 --> 06:13.455
So please please,

06:13.489 --> 06:15.524
Support me like you
always have

06:15.558 --> 06:17.926
And i will deliver for us

06:17.960 --> 06:21.096
Like i always have.

06:21.130 --> 06:23.498
<i>what do you think?</i>

06:23.533 --> 06:26.068
I think it was
a good speech.

06:26.102 --> 06:27.269
Yeah.

06:27.303 --> 06:29.304
Do what you need
to do, ari.

06:29.305 --> 06:31.707
Really?

06:31.741 --> 06:33.408
I love you.

06:36.312 --> 06:37.612
Can we fuck in here?

06:37.647 --> 06:40.782
Johnny, "melrose place"
will not stop calling me.

06:40.817 --> 06:44.152
They like you.
like sally field,
they really really like you.

06:44.220 --> 06:46.388
Well, i'm sorry you have
to deal with that, lloyd.

06:46.422 --> 06:48.090
But i told you,
i'm passing.

06:48.124 --> 06:49.658
Johnny, just go in
and read for them.

06:49.659 --> 06:51.626
10 minutes of your life.
what do you have to lose?

06:51.661 --> 06:53.295
What's left
of my soul, lloyd.

06:53.329 --> 06:56.064
<i>sorry, got to go.</i>

06:56.099 --> 06:57.933
Johnny, maybe you
should just test.

06:57.967 --> 07:00.068
If you get it you can
turn it down if you
really don't want it.

07:00.103 --> 07:01.937
I don't want it.
really.

07:01.971 --> 07:03.638
Look at me.

07:03.673 --> 07:06.041

It's at the house.
i haven't had a chance
to look at it.

07:26.029 --> 07:28.430
You haven't looked

08:24.053 --> 08:25.687
That's my fault.
i wasn't thinking.

08:25.722 --> 08:28.056
- but this is really important.
- what is?

08:28.091 --> 08:30.225
I can't tell you

08:33.830 --> 08:35.563
I can't tell you

Anyway, you can change
your appointment.

08:37.866 --> 08:40.034
( sighs )

08:40.068 --> 08:42.671
Is this really important?

08:42.705 --> 08:44.606
Yes it is.

08:44.640 --> 08:46.375
Okay.

08:46.409 --> 08:48.210
- thank you.
- you owe me.

08:48.244 --> 08:49.778
Always.

09:08.664 --> 09:11.033
- you're like kissing a corpse.
- i'm sorry.

09:11.067 --> 09:13.268
You're not
attracted to me?

09:13.302 --> 09:16.471
Are you kidding?
you're smoking.

09:16.506 --> 09:18.340
- yeah?
- yeah.

09:18.374 --> 09:20.742
Maybe you just need
to loosen up a little.

09:20.777 --> 09:22.477
Relax.

09:27.817 --> 09:29.751
Now you're
getting somewhere.

09:29.786 --> 09:31.987
- yeah?
you like that?
- uh-huh.

09:31.988 --> 09:34.289
You like that?

09:34.323 --> 09:36.258
Yeah.

09:40.763 --> 09:42.330
( sighs )

09:42.398 --> 09:45.167
I can't believe i can't
get you to stop thinking
about her.

09:45.234 --> 09:47.002
I'm sorry.

09:47.003 --> 09:49.171
She hasn't called me
back in three days.

09:49.205 --> 09:51.006
Maybe she doesn't
want to talk to you.

09:51.007 --> 09:53.909
No, i think she's pissed
i didn't try to stop her
from going.

09:53.943 --> 09:55.510
Or that i didn't go
with her, you know?

09:55.511 --> 09:57.345
I don't know her,
turtle.

09:57.380 --> 09:59.314
I should have
gone with her.

09:59.348 --> 10:01.950
Well, maybe you
should go now.

10:01.984 --> 10:04.286
I'm really sorry.

10:04.320 --> 10:06.621
I'll live.

10:06.656 --> 10:09.391
Yeah, but i got you
all worked up

10:09.425 --> 10:12.094
And now i'm just
abandoning you.
that's not fair.

10:12.128 --> 10:14.963
You want me to go down
on you or something?

10:14.997 --> 10:16.865
( scoffs )

10:16.866 --> 10:19.234
- lloyd. lloyd.
- yes?

10:19.268 --> 10:21.002
Ari gold's on his way
up here again.

10:21.037 --> 10:24.373
What?
why is this happening?

10:24.407 --> 10:27.442
Why does ari gold
keep coming up here?

10:28.811 --> 10:31.913
Adam, i gave up my life
to work with you.

10:31.948 --> 10:34.182
You two make
a cute couple.

10:36.252 --> 10:38.854
Adam, talk to me, please.

10:38.888 --> 10:42.157
I think we're merging
or ari's buying us.
i don't know.

10:42.191 --> 10:43.959
Oh my god.
what will that mean for me?

10:43.993 --> 10:46.828
I know what
it'll mean for me.

10:49.732 --> 10:51.967
You know what i'm looking
forward to, terrance?

10:52.001 --> 10:53.568
No, what's that?

10:53.603 --> 10:55.570
Walking through this place
terminator style

10:55.638 --> 10:58.073
And eradicating
all the dead weight.

10:58.074 --> 11:00.242
Unlike you,
i have a soft heart.

11:00.276 --> 11:01.943
( laughs )
soft as a diamond.

11:01.978 --> 11:04.212
Okay, can we dispense
with the pleasantries?

11:04.247 --> 11:07.149
You know, my business
hasn't done too badly
over the years.

11:07.183 --> 11:09.184
But it can be doing
so much better.

11:09.218 --> 11:11.720
And it will be doing better
once we're done here.
so let's move on.

11:11.754 --> 11:14.356
You were always so certain
that you knew better than i.

11:14.390 --> 11:16.058
Barbara's right,
seeing is believing.

11:16.092 --> 11:19.161
But when i trim
the fat off this shithole

11:19.195 --> 11:21.129
And put it all under
the miller gold banner,

11:21.164 --> 11:24.566
You will see what it
could have been if you
would have kept me around.

11:24.600 --> 11:26.935
Oh, i look forward to that.

11:26.969 --> 11:30.138
Except of course it won't be
under the miller gold banner.

11:30.173 --> 11:31.773
I don't follow.

11:31.808 --> 11:35.177
You obviously havet read
the addendum in the contract.

11:35.211 --> 11:37.746
- what addendum?
- it was added in
this morning.

11:37.780 --> 11:40.282
It's nothing really.
it's just i want assurances

11:40.316 --> 11:43.251
That the 40-year-old
terrance mcquiewick agency,

11:43.286 --> 11:46.221
Which i founded, doesn't
somehow lose its name.

11:46.255 --> 11:49.024
Well, that's not really
for you to decide.

11:49.058 --> 11:50.325
The addendum says it is.

11:50.360 --> 11:51.927
Are you joking?

11:51.961 --> 11:54.029
Ari, we've only had
our name for two years.

11:54.063 --> 11:56.498
- how attached
to it can you be?
- i like gold, okay?

11:56.532 --> 11:59.267
You can't pull this shit
last second.

11:59.302 --> 12:01.336
I wouldn't have
thought i needed it.

12:01.371 --> 12:03.338
My lawyers
didn't think i did.

12:03.373 --> 12:06.675
They said, "what idiwoud
of a brand name

12:06.709 --> 12:08.610
That is synonymous
with entertainment

12:08.644 --> 12:10.779
And has been for nearly
four decades?"

12:10.813 --> 12:14.082
But i woke up
in a terrible sweat
last night.

12:14.117 --> 12:15.884
And i thought,
"my god.

12:15.918 --> 12:19.554
I know what idiot
would want that-- him."

12:19.589 --> 12:22.024
You got your price,
you have no other say.

12:22.058 --> 12:23.658
- ari.
- i'm out of here.

12:23.693 --> 12:26.428
Come on, ari.
don't let your
unchecked ego

12:26.462 --> 12:28.797
Bring you
to your knees again.

12:28.831 --> 12:31.600
Ari, come back and sign
the fucking papers.

12:31.634 --> 12:34.336
Lloyd lee, you got
a new lease on life.

12:34.370 --> 12:36.138
You too, scumbag.

12:36.172 --> 12:38.573
<i>- drama: lloyd. lloyd.
- yeah, johnny?</i>

12:38.608 --> 12:41.743
I said it doesn't matter
because it isn't about
the money.

12:41.778 --> 12:44.679
Tell 'em i said thank you
but no thank you.

12:44.714 --> 12:47.416
<i>- okay.
- all right, i'll talk
to you later.</i>

12:47.450 --> 12:48.817
Okay.

12:48.851 --> 12:50.519
What happened?

12:50.553 --> 12:52.688
They're willing to push
my quote 10 gs.

12:52.722 --> 12:54.990
You're making 'em want you.
what are you thinking?

12:55.024 --> 12:57.325
I'm thinking about
you and me

12:57.360 --> 12:59.661
Scouring the italian
countryside.

12:59.662 --> 13:01.263
I can't think
of anything better.

13:01.297 --> 13:03.298
You know i'm gonna be
working most of the time?

13:03.332 --> 13:06.001
Yeah, you've still got to eat
and blow off some steam.

13:06.002 --> 13:07.969
True. i just want to make
sure you're gonna be okay.

13:08.004 --> 13:10.639
- i don't want you
to have any regrets.
- i'm great, bro. really.

13:10.673 --> 13:13.175
I might even take up
as a cobbler like daniel day.

13:13.209 --> 13:14.743
Now that would
be interesting.

13:14.777 --> 13:17.012
( phone rings )

13:17.013 --> 13:18.980
Ciao.
the chase residence.

13:19.015 --> 13:20.449
<i>hey, it's matt damon.</i>

13:20.483 --> 13:23.719
Hey, matt, it's johnny.
what can i do for you?

13:23.753 --> 13:26.421
You can write a big check
to the one by one foundation.

13:26.456 --> 13:29.091
I'd love to, but my future's
a little uncertain right now.

13:29.125 --> 13:31.360
- i'm out of the business.
- were you in the business?

13:31.394 --> 13:32.828
I was on a hit show
for three years.

13:32.829 --> 13:35.397
<i>- what happene  they fired ?
- no, i left by choice.</i>

13:35.431 --> 13:38.133
Well, listen, john,
there are millions
of helpless children

13:38.167 --> 13:39.601
With much much
bigger problems.

13:39.635 --> 13:40.902
Well, yeah,
of course.

13:40.937 --> 13:43.438
Is vince there?
did he look at
the materials yet?

13:43.473 --> 13:45.173
Hang on.
it's damon.

13:45.174 --> 13:47.542
He wants to know about
that charity thing.

13:47.577 --> 13:50.011
He must have slipped out.

13:50.012 --> 13:52.013
But i can see the brochures
opened up here on the table.

13:52.048 --> 13:53.882
Put him on the fucking
phone, john.

13:53.916 --> 13:56.018
Okay.

13:56.052 --> 13:57.753
Sorry, he jason bourned me.

13:59.422 --> 14:02.157
( sighs )
hey, matt.

14:02.191 --> 14:04.092
I was just looking
over the stuff.

14:04.127 --> 14:06.395
<i>- pretty moving shit,
isn't it?
- very.</i>

14:06.429 --> 14:07.996
Okay, so can i
count on you?

14:08.031 --> 14:09.931
Just let me know
what i can do.

14:09.966 --> 14:11.400
<i>i'll tell you
what you can do.</i>

14:11.434 --> 14:14.903
<i>we've got some trips coming
up to cleveland, ohio.</i>

14:14.937 --> 14:17.472
Feeding america, one of
our partners, is running
a food bank there.

14:17.507 --> 14:20.308
I need a other celebrity
to go with me to draw
attention to the fact

14:20.343 --> 14:22.711
That one out of six
american children--

14:22.745 --> 14:25.280
One out of six,
are food insecur

14:25.314 --> 14:26.982
Do you even know
what that means, vince?

14:27.016 --> 14:29.751
It means they don't
know where their next
meal is coming from.

14:29.786 --> 14:32.454
One out of six americans.
it's fucking shameful.

14:32.488 --> 14:34.990
Yeah, i'm leaving
for italy tomorrow.

14:35.024 --> 14:36.725
You know what?
fuck the american kids.

14:36.726 --> 14:38.627
Let them starve.
have a good time
on your vacation.

14:38.661 --> 14:41.196
No, it's not a vacation.
i'm working.

14:41.230 --> 14:44.166
- get off your arse, vince.
- that's bono, vince.

14:44.200 --> 14:46.535
Oh, hey, bono.

14:46.569 --> 14:50.405
You know, it doesntake muchg
effect here, vince.

14:50.473 --> 14:51.973
<i>- yeah.
- matt: i'll tell you what--</i>

14:52.008 --> 14:54.476
When you're done with
your frank darabont movie,

14:54.510 --> 14:57.379
- i'm gonna take you
on a trip, okay?
- yeah, for sure.

14:57.413 --> 14:59.514
<i>in the near term
i would like a check.</i>

14:59.549 --> 15:02.084
Okay.
for how much?

15:02.118 --> 15:04.920
- do what's right, vince.
- don't be a cheapskate, man.

15:04.921 --> 15:07.255
Do it today, okay?
don't make me wait.
i'm going to be waiting.

15:07.256 --> 15:09.257
-we'll both be waiting.
- see you, vince.

15:09.292 --> 15:10.759
<i>( door shuts )</i>

15:10.760 --> 15:12.594
Yo, what's up?

15:12.628 --> 15:14.896
I'm going to new zealand.

15:14.931 --> 15:16.498
Hey, what happened
with the coed?

15:16.532 --> 15:19.935
Nothing.
not today or last night.

15:19.969 --> 15:21.837
You lied?

15:21.871 --> 15:25.207
Sorry.  i love jamie.
i don't want to be with
anybody else.

15:25.241 --> 15:27.476
I got a 6:00 p.m. flight.

15:30.813 --> 15:33.248
Well...

15:33.282 --> 15:36.585
I guess freedom is ours
and ours alone, johnny.

15:36.619 --> 15:38.987
Yeah.

15:40.156 --> 15:42.357
What's wrong?

15:42.392 --> 15:45.394
I may have been lying
to myself too, bro.

15:45.428 --> 15:47.062
I'm an actor.

15:47.096 --> 15:49.231
I've got to get
to that meeting.

15:50.633 --> 15:54.269
Eric:
we got lucky today.
basically perfect weather.

15:54.303 --> 15:56.538
Yeah.

15:56.572 --> 15:59.808
God, it feels like forever
since we were last here.

15:59.876 --> 16:01.309
It was only
a couple years ago.

16:01.310 --> 16:02.778
More like three.

16:02.812 --> 16:05.080
We spent two
nights at shutters.
that was a good weekend.

16:05.114 --> 16:06.615
It was for me.

16:06.649 --> 16:09.584
You got so sunburned you
couldn't breathe without pain.

16:09.619 --> 16:12.120
Maybe i glorified it
a little bit.

16:12.155 --> 16:14.189
No, it was amazing.

16:14.223 --> 16:17.325
So what are we doing here?

16:17.360 --> 16:19.995
Is vince thinking about buying
this place or something?

16:19.996 --> 16:21.496
No.

16:21.531 --> 16:23.265
So what then?

16:23.299 --> 16:27.035
I just wanted to remind you
how good we could be together.

16:29.806 --> 16:31.440
Wow.

16:31.474 --> 16:33.508
You've got to be kidding me.

16:33.509 --> 16:36.144
- sloan.
- eric, i canceled
on someone.

16:36.179 --> 16:37.579
Was it really
that important?

16:37.613 --> 16:40.449
It's the guy i'm seeing
and yes, i like him.

16:40.483 --> 16:42.117
Well, i still love you.

16:43.486 --> 16:45.787
- i want to go home.
- sloan.

16:45.822 --> 16:48.256
Eric, we've been over this.

16:48.291 --> 16:50.492
I want to go home now.

16:55.998 --> 16:58.266
Hey, jame,
it's me.

16:58.301 --> 17:00.869
I just wanted to let you know
i'm on my way to see you.

17:00.937 --> 17:03.472
We need to talk
face to face.

17:03.506 --> 17:06.208
I'm taking off in a little,
so please call me if
you get this.

17:12.548 --> 17:15.117
- auckland. you traveling to?

17:15.151 --> 17:18.854
- how long is the flight?
- about 14 and a half hours.

17:18.887 --> 17:20.188
Sweet.

17:20.223 --> 17:23.425
This lying scumbag
piece of shit.

17:23.459 --> 17:24.792
What did you
expect from him?

17:24.827 --> 17:27.362
I expected him to honor
the deal that he agreed to.

17:27.396 --> 17:30.065
- he was never going to.
- he has never honored
anything.

17:30.099 --> 17:31.733
But you still want this.

17:31.768 --> 17:33.869
More than i want
my wife to crave pussy.

17:33.903 --> 17:37.606
But i will not be controlled
by that rotting old douchebag.

17:37.640 --> 17:40.675
<i>- i was for too long.
- it's a fair deal though, ari.</i>

17:40.710 --> 17:42.744
For whatever reason,
he's being more than fair.

17:42.779 --> 17:45.013
And you know that
if you drop this ball

17:45.048 --> 17:47.382
The whole town
is gonna dive for this.

17:47.417 --> 17:50.519
<i>- what the hell?
- he's weak.</i>

17:50.553 --> 17:53.155
I don't know why, but he is.
just get the deal done.

17:53.189 --> 17:55.223
- andrew.
- terrance.

17:55.258 --> 17:57.759
Nice to see you.
didn't realize you were
still in the business.

17:57.794 --> 17:59.761
- die.
- not for you.

17:59.796 --> 18:02.864
Not for any tv agents.
hello, ari.

18:02.899 --> 18:05.901
I should kick your ass
for wasting my time.

18:05.935 --> 18:09.504
Remember when you first
came to work for me?

18:09.539 --> 18:11.473
We used to go spar
at my gym.

18:11.507 --> 18:13.275
I'd kick your ass.

18:13.309 --> 18:15.577
You were my boss.
i let you win.

18:15.611 --> 18:17.713
I could still kick
your ass and you know it.

18:17.747 --> 18:20.716
Listen, you crawled
over here for a reason.
what is it?

18:20.750 --> 18:23.285
I want to make
this deal work.

18:23.319 --> 18:25.921
<i>well, then i suggest
that you go find a buyer</i>

18:25.955 --> 18:27.756
Who will let you
push them around.

18:27.790 --> 18:29.925
'cause it ain't
gonna be me.

18:29.959 --> 18:31.793
I want you to buy it.

18:31.794 --> 18:33.195
<i>why?</i>

18:33.229 --> 18:35.831
Because you miss having some
sort of control over me?

18:35.865 --> 18:38.734
Listen, i'm smart enough
to know that i never had
control over you.

18:38.768 --> 18:42.070
No.  not while
i was working for you.

18:42.105 --> 18:43.972
<i>or shall i say with you?</i>

18:43.973 --> 18:46.408
I was your number-one asset.

18:46.442 --> 18:49.077
We used to laugh at all
those other dickheads.

18:49.112 --> 18:51.146
But you became one
when you threw me out

18:51.214 --> 18:53.048
<i>of the company
that i built.</i>

18:53.082 --> 18:55.984
Look, let's put
the past behind us.

18:56.019 --> 18:59.654
The future is yours.
don't destroy my legacy
out of spite.

18:59.689 --> 19:02.157
Admit that you destroyed
me out of spite,

19:02.191 --> 19:05.027
Out of bitterness
and out of jealousy.

19:05.061 --> 19:07.329
Is that what
all this is about?
you want me to apologize?

19:07.330 --> 19:11.099
Poor hurt little boy
still pines for his
daddy's approval?

19:11.134 --> 19:13.969
I became too big for you
and you couldn't handle it.

19:14.003 --> 19:16.271
No, i couldn't handle
your rotten ego

19:16.305 --> 19:18.473
Or your extraordinary
salary demands.

19:18.508 --> 19:19.908
Bullshit.

19:19.942 --> 19:22.944
So this is why you won't
let me keep my name?

19:22.979 --> 19:25.514
If you don't like it,
you can go find someone else.

19:25.515 --> 19:27.582
No, i don't want
anyone else.

19:27.617 --> 19:31.186
You're the only one who
can take this company forward
for the next 50 years.

19:31.220 --> 19:34.456
- well, then apologize.
- i just did.

19:34.490 --> 19:36.858
It was a mistake

19:36.893 --> 19:39.061
That i kicked you out,
ari, all right?

19:39.095 --> 19:42.330
I was just
feeling unneeded.

19:43.733 --> 19:46.201
Well, you were needed.

19:46.235 --> 19:49.871
Well, you know you're
going to grow old
someday, ari.

19:49.906 --> 19:52.941
Hopefully
you'll find someone

19:52.975 --> 19:55.744
Who'll be able to help
you do it gracefully.

19:59.749 --> 20:01.383
I'll let you
keep your name.

20:06.889 --> 20:09.224
( chuckles )
make it last.

20:11.894 --> 20:14.296
You've got a roomful of people
that are very excited

20:14.330 --> 20:16.698
That you changed
your mind and decided
to come in, johnny.

20:16.733 --> 20:19.034
Well, i'm just glad you guys
are still willing to see me.

20:19.068 --> 20:22.270
Truth is, phil begged
us to see you again.

20:22.305 --> 20:24.172
And i'm--

20:26.209 --> 20:28.176
I'm questioning
the reluctance.

20:28.211 --> 20:30.078
<i>are you not
feeling this role?</i>

20:30.113 --> 20:32.547
- no no no.
- well, what then?

20:32.582 --> 20:36.284
Well, for a minute there
i didn't think i wanted
this anymore.

20:36.319 --> 20:38.020
But then it hit me.

20:38.054 --> 20:40.422
What i don't want anymore
is the rejection.

20:41.657 --> 20:44.092
<i>18 years of it
has taken its toll.</i>

20:44.127 --> 20:47.029
I was on this show
once before.

20:47.063 --> 20:50.866
And i was on another series
for the past 87 episodes.

20:50.900 --> 20:54.703
I've done over 140 guest
spots on tv and other movies,

20:54.737 --> 20:57.672
16 plays, 39 commercials--

20:57.707 --> 20:59.908
Yet still you haven't
seen enough

20:59.942 --> 21:02.010
To just offer me the part.

21:02.045 --> 21:05.447
Still you make me
sing for my supper.

21:05.448 --> 21:07.949
Hey, if you
don't want to...

21:07.984 --> 21:10.252
No, it doesn't matter
if i want to.

21:10.286 --> 21:12.454
I have to.

21:12.488 --> 21:14.523
There you go.
that's the spirit.

21:14.557 --> 21:16.258
Roll this.
do it, johnny.

21:19.062 --> 21:22.130
( shouts )
here we go!

21:22.165 --> 21:24.566
Yeah, they basically gave me
the part in the room, bro.

21:24.600 --> 21:27.803
- yeah?
- yeah, yagota said
i was pitch perfect.

21:27.837 --> 21:30.472
I even got a sincere thumbs up
from that jerkoff director.

21:30.506 --> 21:32.641
You should have stopped caring
a long time ago, johnny.

21:32.675 --> 21:34.209
<i>no shit.</i>

21:34.243 --> 21:36.378
So i guess this means
i'm going to italy alone
then, huh?

21:36.412 --> 21:39.047
Well, i don't have
an official offer and i don't
want to jinx it,

21:39.082 --> 21:41.850
But sorry, bro.
looks like you're solo.

21:41.884 --> 21:43.785
I'm proud of you, johnny.

21:43.820 --> 21:45.320
Thanks, vince.

21:45.355 --> 21:47.422
<i>- later.
- later.</i>

21:57.100 --> 21:58.834
I don't know why
you're so angry.

21:58.868 --> 22:00.769
I said i was sorry.

22:00.803 --> 22:02.938
You rejected me,
i feel bad enough.

22:02.972 --> 22:04.673
You should be
used to that by now.

22:04.741 --> 22:06.608
Look, i was wrong,
all right?

22:06.642 --> 22:09.077
The guys told me
you were over me
and i didn't believe them.

22:09.112 --> 22:12.147
<i>and you usually listen to
every word the guys say.</i>

22:12.181 --> 22:14.049
I know.

22:14.083 --> 22:16.218
It's just that even though
we've been apart for
the last three years,

22:16.252 --> 22:19.521
I always believed
that one day i'd have
you, a house, kids.

22:19.555 --> 22:22.357
- you mean we.
- i don't follow.

22:22.392 --> 22:25.260
We would have a house
and kids.

22:25.294 --> 22:28.597
You're a selfish prick.
you follow that?

22:30.933 --> 22:33.535
Why is it so selfish
because i'm trying to tell
you i want to be with you?

22:33.569 --> 22:36.238
Because last time you
convinced me it was forever

22:36.272 --> 22:38.206
And then took off with your
buddies five minutes later.

22:38.241 --> 22:41.076
I'm sorry.
i was trying to get
my business going.

22:41.110 --> 22:43.879
- you took me for granted.
- i know.

22:43.913 --> 22:46.748
Eric, why are you
doing this to me?

22:46.783 --> 22:48.050
Because i love you.

22:48.084 --> 22:50.419
I will not get lured
back into this.

22:50.453 --> 22:51.987
I can't trust you.

22:52.021 --> 22:55.490
You love to have a girlfriend,
but on your terms.

22:55.525 --> 22:58.260
You're never gonna
be able to commit,
not to anyone.

22:58.294 --> 23:00.395
That is not true.
i will commit to you
right now.

23:00.430 --> 23:02.831
- eric, stop.
- i swear to god.

23:02.865 --> 23:05.100
- i'll marry you.
- you'll marry me?

23:05.134 --> 23:07.669
Yes, i will get in that car
right now, drive to vegas

23:07.704 --> 23:09.404
And commit to you
for the rest of my life.

23:09.439 --> 23:13.008
Really?  have you even
thought about this?

23:13.042 --> 23:15.744
Yeah, i have.

23:15.778 --> 23:18.547
And this time
i swear on my life

23:18.581 --> 23:21.283
It'll be forever.

23:35.431 --> 23:37.566
Jesse.
how've you been?

23:37.600 --> 23:40.102
I've been--

23:40.103 --> 23:43.038
Great. i'm back
and you're fired.

23:43.072 --> 23:44.373
- ( paintballs shooting )
- hello all.

23:44.407 --> 23:47.709
No need to run.
your fates have already
been sealed.

23:47.744 --> 23:50.112
- you're safe.
- oh my god.

23:50.146 --> 23:51.947
You're safe,
for now.

23:51.981 --> 23:54.149
Hello, nice to see you.
who's your best client?

23:54.183 --> 23:56.284
Um...

23:56.319 --> 23:57.919
Jesus!

23:57.954 --> 24:00.922
I represent
"jon and kate plus 8."

24:03.626 --> 24:05.927
Where are you, davies?

24:08.131 --> 24:11.600
Ari, i'm already packing
to save myself the indignity.

24:11.634 --> 24:13.735
That's too bad.

24:13.770 --> 24:16.204
Ari, jesus christ!

24:16.239 --> 24:19.074
- have you lost
your mind, ari?
- ( laughing )

24:19.108 --> 24:21.243
Now where's lloyd lee?

24:21.277 --> 24:23.078
Mr. lee knewhat you
were coming, mr. gold.

24:23.112 --> 24:24.646
He decided not to wait
for your arrival.

24:24.680 --> 24:26.281
Now why don't
i believe you?

24:26.315 --> 24:27.716
( gun fires )

24:27.750 --> 24:29.785
Now, lloyd, maybe
you're not here.

24:29.819 --> 24:31.086
<i>maybe you are.</i>

24:31.120 --> 24:33.655
Either way, you have
nothing to fear

24:33.690 --> 24:36.692
Because i'm not
gonna kill you.
i love you.

24:36.726 --> 24:39.661
<i>you see, even though
you betrayed me,</i>

24:39.729 --> 24:42.230
<i>you were the best slave
that i ever had.</i>

24:42.265 --> 24:45.734
I mean, who could
possibly replace

24:45.768 --> 24:48.236
The way that you picked up
my dry-cleaning?

24:48.271 --> 24:50.005
No one.

24:50.039 --> 24:53.642
Who could better the way
you picked up my dog's shit?

24:53.676 --> 24:56.478
And if i liked
short, fat men

24:56.512 --> 24:57.946
Sucking on my dick,

24:57.980 --> 25:01.316
I'm sure that no one could
do it better than you either.

25:01.351 --> 25:03.985
So return to the king

25:04.020 --> 25:05.954
Or exile yourself

25:05.988 --> 25:07.989
From this town forever.

25:08.024 --> 25:10.592
You have until the end
of the day tomorrow

25:10.626 --> 25:13.862
To agree to be
rebranded mine.

25:13.896 --> 25:16.131
( gun firing )

25:18.701 --> 25:22.037
<i>woman:
welcome aboard,
ladies and gentlemen.</i>

25:23.406 --> 25:25.173
Excuse me, ma'am.

25:25.208 --> 25:27.175
If there's a seat left with
an open one next to it,

25:27.210 --> 25:29.378
- i'd love to grab that.
- as would i.

25:29.445 --> 25:31.813
I'm sorry, but i think
the flight is full.

25:31.848 --> 25:35.117
- awesome.
- ( phone rings )

25:38.788 --> 25:42.157
Jamie.  jesus, why
haven't you called me?

25:42.191 --> 25:44.993
<i>- turtle, where are you?
- i'm on my way to you.</i>

25:45.028 --> 25:46.628
I don't want you
to do that.

25:46.662 --> 25:48.463
<i>i don't want
to see other people.</i>

25:48.498 --> 25:50.766
<i>- i can't believe you'd
think that i would.
- turtle.</i>

25:50.800 --> 25:52.634
Excuse me, sir.i'm sorry, ya
have to get off your phone.

25:52.668 --> 25:54.669
- we're preparing
for takeoff, okay?
- just one minute.

25:54.704 --> 25:55.804
- sir.
- just one minute.

25:55.838 --> 25:57.939
<i>turtle, please
don't come here.</i>

25:57.974 --> 26:01.676
<i>i know i said you should
see other people because i
don't want you to resent me.</i>

26:01.711 --> 26:05.213
- but i was just being weak.
- weak? how?

26:05.248 --> 26:09.184
The truth is i don't want
to end up resenting you.

26:09.218 --> 26:11.353
Why would you resent me?

26:11.387 --> 26:13.488
Because i could be
gone for a year.

26:13.523 --> 26:16.558
And if the show is successful
i could be gone for five.

26:16.592 --> 26:18.427
So you want to see
other people?

26:18.494 --> 26:21.563
I don't know what i want.
but i've done the long-
distance thing before

26:21.597 --> 26:23.699
And i ended up getting
really really hurt.

26:23.733 --> 26:26.501
<i>and i would never want that
to happen to either of us.</i>

26:26.536 --> 26:28.770
It's not like
i won't come see you.

26:28.771 --> 26:31.373
<i>you've worked so hard this
year to get your life going.</i>

26:31.407 --> 26:33.909
You can't be flying
back and forth to new zealand.

26:33.943 --> 26:36.545
<i>- i can make it work.
- it wouldn't work.</i>

26:36.579 --> 26:39.614
And if we're ever gonna
have a chance in the future,

26:39.615 --> 26:41.883
We shouldn't try.

26:43.386 --> 26:46.288
Wow.
i didn't see this coming.

26:46.289 --> 26:49.091
I really do love you.

26:49.125 --> 26:51.960
Sir, you need to get off
the phone right now.

26:51.994 --> 26:54.963
Okay then.

26:54.997 --> 26:58.300
Turtle, i'm sorry.

26:58.334 --> 27:00.068
Yeah.

27:03.573 --> 27:06.341
<i>( engines powering up )</i>

27:06.376 --> 27:09.010
I've got to get
off this plane.

27:10.179 --> 27:11.613
I've got to get off
this plane.

27:11.647 --> 27:13.315
I'm sorry,
that's not possible.

27:13.349 --> 27:15.717
The door is closed
and we've already pulled
away from the gate.

27:15.752 --> 27:18.520
I can't go to new zealand.
i've got to get off
this plane now.

27:18.554 --> 27:20.956
Sit down.
put your seat belt on.

27:20.990 --> 27:22.624
What if i yell bomb?

27:22.658 --> 27:25.060
Then you can get off
the plane and you can
go straight to jail

27:25.094 --> 27:27.696
And pay a $250,000 fine.

27:27.730 --> 27:29.765
( sighs )

27:33.503 --> 27:35.604
Thank you.

27:39.475 --> 27:41.343
Hey, vince,
we got to roll.

27:41.377 --> 27:42.944
You're gonna
miss your flight.

27:42.979 --> 27:44.246
I'm flying private, johnny.

27:44.280 --> 27:45.881
They won't leave
till i get there.

27:45.915 --> 27:47.482
Oh yeah, i forgot.

27:47.517 --> 27:49.518
- no word from e?
- or turtle.

27:49.552 --> 27:52.120
( phone ringing )

27:52.155 --> 27:54.423
It's phil yagota.

27:54.457 --> 27:57.659
Hey, phil.
give me something
officially great.

27:57.694 --> 27:59.761
John, you blew us all
away at the audition.

27:59.796 --> 28:01.730
Yeah, i know.
you told me that yesterday.

28:01.764 --> 28:03.699
<i>i wanted to tell
you again.</i>

28:03.766 --> 28:05.500
So did i get it or not?

28:05.535 --> 28:07.402
In my mind you did.

28:07.437 --> 28:10.338
<i>- whose other mind is there?
- the network's.</i>

28:10.373 --> 28:12.941
<i>- they didn't like me?
- they did like you.</i>

28:12.975 --> 28:16.011
- but?
- they think you're
too old, john.

28:16.045 --> 28:18.413
<i>- but i'm not.
- well, they think you are.</i>

28:18.448 --> 28:20.982
I didn't shave yesterday.
i could cut my hair.

28:21.017 --> 28:22.751
They're going
younger, john.

28:25.521 --> 28:27.956
I guess they've got to do
what they've got to do.

28:27.990 --> 28:29.691
I've got to tell you,

28:29.726 --> 28:32.294
I thought you were gonna put
up a little more of a fight.

28:32.328 --> 28:34.596
I got no fight
left in me, phil.

28:34.630 --> 28:37.399
<i>- i left it all in that room.
- i know you did, john.</i>

28:37.433 --> 28:40.268
- and so does the network.  -.

28:40.303 --> 28:42.671
<i>in fact, they said
that they think</i>

28:42.705 --> 28:45.340
<i>that you are finally ready
to carry something.</i>

28:45.375 --> 28:47.175
Great.
let me know when
they got something.

28:47.210 --> 28:49.311
They want to start developing
something for you now.

28:49.345 --> 28:52.047
<i>they want to give you
a holding deal and they
want to make sure</i>

28:52.081 --> 28:54.416

29:18.374 --> 29:20.242
A holding deal.

29:22.945 --> 29:24.946
It sucks the guys

It sucks for them.

29:39.095 --> 29:41.463
You just flew in

29:41.497 --> 29:44.132
Oh yeah, i'm trying
to break the guinness record

29:44.167 --> 29:46.735
For most miles in 24 hours.
what's it to you?

30:01.451 --> 30:03.352
Wow, i didn't really
think you'd show.

30:03.386 --> 30:06.254
- i didn't come for work.
- what did you come for?

30:06.289 --> 30:07.656
I came to tell you
to go fuck yourself.

30:07.690 --> 30:10.392
- watch it, lloyd.
- don't tell me what to do.

30:10.426 --> 30:12.894
And don't you dare
let yourself be convinced

30:12.929 --> 30:14.463
That i betrayed you.

30:14.497 --> 30:17.966
You abused me.
and you won't ever again.

30:18.000 --> 30:20.335
But i will work myself
to the bone

30:20.370 --> 30:23.372
So that someday i will be
in a position to abuse you.

30:23.406 --> 30:26.241
You're not so smart.
how could you be

30:26.275 --> 30:28.310
If you actually believed
i would ever work for
you again?

30:28.344 --> 30:31.213
So you wouldn't work for me
if you were an agent?

30:31.247 --> 30:33.782
Oh, you think
i'll fall for this?

30:33.816 --> 30:36.051
- and then you'll
laugh in my face.
- i'm serious, lloyd.

30:36.085 --> 30:37.652
You just showed me balls
i didn't know you had.

30:37.687 --> 30:40.255
So that speech made you
believe i should be an agent?

30:40.289 --> 30:42.391
I believed it
before you got here.

30:43.393 --> 30:45.560
Terrance apologized to me.

30:45.595 --> 30:47.763
I...

30:48.998 --> 30:50.866
I'm sorry, lloyd.

30:51.968 --> 30:53.735
I still think
you're fucking with me.

30:53.770 --> 30:55.504
Go check your office.

31:05.548 --> 31:09.051
It's supposed to say agent.

31:09.085 --> 31:11.453
