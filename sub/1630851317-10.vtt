on</i> Bob Hearts Abishola...

00:06.354 --> 00:07.181
<i>E kasaan,</i> Mum.

00:07.224 --> 00:09.139
- Dele.
- Surprise!

00:09.183 --> 00:12.534
Oh, Dele, my baby boy.
I've missed you

00:12.577 --> 00:14.884
- so much.
- I've missed you, too.

00:14.927 --> 00:16.581
I don't understand.
How did you get here?

00:16.625 --> 00:17.887
- Abishola.
- Mummy.

00:17.930 --> 00:20.411
I see you have gained weight
since the wedding.

00:22.413 --> 00:24.546
Surprise.

00:24.589 --> 00:26.896
- Where's Bob?
- Still in bed.

00:26.939 --> 00:29.377
Hmm. I'm surprised
a company president

00:29.420 --> 00:30.987
can sleep in on a weekday.

00:31.031 --> 00:32.293
Bob works very hard, Mummy.

00:32.336 --> 00:33.424
Of course he does.

00:33.468 --> 00:35.383
Just not today, apparently.

00:37.385 --> 00:39.691
Bob does not deserve
to be spoken about this way.

00:39.735 --> 00:42.172
And I do not deserve this tone.

00:42.216 --> 00:43.304
Am I not

00:43.347 --> 00:44.348
still your mother?

00:44.392 --> 00:46.655
Yes, you are.

00:48.700 --> 00:50.311
You are also insulting

00:50.354 --> 00:51.703
my husband in our home,

00:51.747 --> 00:53.923
and I will not have it.

00:53.966 --> 00:56.317
How dare you speak to me
this way.

00:56.360 --> 00:58.536
I'm sure Abishola is sorry
for what she said.

00:58.580 --> 01:00.712
It is too late
for apologies.

01:00.756 --> 01:02.714
I will never speak to her again.

01:02.758 --> 01:04.716
I am just worried
that Abishola

01:04.760 --> 01:06.762
will not be able to see
how furious you are

01:06.805 --> 01:09.112
if you are staying here.

01:10.113 --> 01:12.898
♪ Oh, yeah, yeah

01:12.942 --> 01:14.900
♪ Oh, my gosh, oh

01:14.944 --> 01:16.250
♪ Oh, my gosh,
oh ♪

01:16.293 --> 01:18.295
♪ Oh, my gosh, oh...

01:18.339 --> 01:20.906
This is way better
than Benihana.

01:20.950 --> 01:23.039
You know, as someone
who can't cook or dance,

01:23.083 --> 01:25.215
you're kind of showing me up
right now.

01:25.259 --> 01:26.695
It's a new dance I
learned in Nigeria.

01:26.738 --> 01:27.870
Come on, try it.

01:27.913 --> 01:29.219
♪ Fine girls...

01:29.263 --> 01:31.091
- Ready?
- Okay.

01:31.134 --> 01:33.223
Step, step, back, back.

01:33.267 --> 01:35.921
Step, step, back, back.
There you go.

01:35.965 --> 01:38.141
Look, Ma, I'm dancing.

01:38.185 --> 01:40.274
For the record,
I'm dancing, too.

01:40.317 --> 01:42.754
- Ah, ah, yes, yes.
- Come on,

01:42.798 --> 01:44.756
let's see what you got.
Come on. Let me show you, let me show you.

01:44.800 --> 01:46.236
Oh, yeah?
I showed a lot to Dele.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.498
♪ Summer...

01:47.542 --> 01:50.110
- Ay! Ay!
- Ay!

01:51.154 --> 01:52.808
Something smells delicious.

01:52.851 --> 01:55.898
We've got jollof, egusi
and, of course, moi moi.

01:55.941 --> 01:57.943
You made moi moi
from scratch?

01:57.987 --> 01:59.162
Just like Great-Granny.

01:59.206 --> 02:01.338
Nobody can make it like her.

02:01.382 --> 02:03.558
♪ Love no dey them face...

02:03.601 --> 02:07.170
Mmm. You will make this
every day until you leave.

02:07.214 --> 02:09.172
Yes, Mum.

02:09.216 --> 02:11.131
The best part is we didn't
have to lift a finger.

02:11.174 --> 02:12.306
Came home, he was
already cooking.

02:12.349 --> 02:13.524
What do you mean?

02:13.568 --> 02:15.570
Your responsible young man

02:15.613 --> 02:18.138
went and got
all the ingredients by himself.

02:18.181 --> 02:20.183
How did you get to the store?

02:20.227 --> 02:21.532
I Ubered.

02:21.576 --> 02:23.099
Uber?

02:23.143 --> 02:24.535
Uh-oh.

02:24.579 --> 02:25.754
Who told you
you could Uber?

02:25.797 --> 02:27.277
I thought it would be okay.

02:27.321 --> 02:28.757
I do it all the time in Nigeria.

02:28.800 --> 02:30.759
And how did you pay
for all of this?

02:30.802 --> 02:32.717
With my credit card.

02:32.761 --> 02:34.110
I did not give you
a credit card.

02:34.154 --> 02:35.764
Dad did.

02:36.634 --> 02:39.507
Give me the card. Now.

02:39.550 --> 02:40.769
Yes, Mum.

02:40.812 --> 02:42.640
Hey, how did that go again?

02:42.684 --> 02:45.339
It was forward, for... Okay.

03:10.842 --> 03:13.018
Dele does not need
a credit card.

03:13.062 --> 03:15.020
He's a child.
Ah, ah.

03:15.064 --> 03:16.457
He is a young man.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.328
And a man works
for what he has in life.

03:18.372 --> 03:20.678
It's not handed to him
by his father.

03:20.722 --> 03:23.028
He earned the card
by getting good grades.

03:23.072 --> 03:24.682
I monitor his spending.

03:24.726 --> 03:26.597
This teaches him responsibility.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.251
<i>I</i> teach him responsibility.

03:28.295 --> 03:31.515
Not you. Not Uber.

03:31.559 --> 03:33.256
And what does he learn
taking the bus?

03:33.300 --> 03:35.737
That money is not everything.
Ah.

03:35.780 --> 03:37.042
And you believe that?

03:37.086 --> 03:40.350
Of course not,
but that is what we teach him.

03:40.394 --> 03:44.006
Abishola, I never questioned
your decisions

03:44.049 --> 03:45.399
when you were raising Dele.

03:45.442 --> 03:47.009
I am still raising him.

03:47.052 --> 03:49.054
And I know what is best.

03:49.098 --> 03:50.404
- And I don't?
- Not if you're

03:50.447 --> 03:52.362
only going to spoil him.
I am giving him

03:52.406 --> 03:53.885
the lifestyle that he deserves.

03:53.929 --> 03:55.539
No. You are buying his love

03:55.583 --> 03:59.239
because you were gone
for eight years.

04:01.241 --> 04:04.287
I am doing what I think is best
for my son.

04:04.331 --> 04:07.159
What is best for our son
is that we discuss

04:07.203 --> 04:09.988
how we're going
- to raise him together.
Fine.

04:10.032 --> 04:11.773
- Let's discuss it.
- Okay.

04:11.816 --> 04:14.254
No credit card.

04:27.223 --> 04:28.920
Ebun.

04:28.964 --> 04:30.008
I-I...

04:30.052 --> 04:31.619
I have noticed
that the thermostat

04:31.662 --> 04:34.535
again has been moved
above 85 degrees.

04:34.578 --> 04:38.103
Which, before today,
I did not know it could do.

04:39.104 --> 04:41.846
I had no choice. It is freezing.

04:41.890 --> 04:45.110
Uh, in the future,
if you're uncomfortable,

04:45.154 --> 04:49.027
you can simply move it
a degree or two instead of 20.

04:52.030 --> 04:53.205
What is this channel?

04:53.249 --> 04:55.338
I wanted to watch
my Nigerian movies,

04:55.382 --> 04:57.732
so I had to upgrade
your cable.

04:57.775 --> 05:00.474
Oh, thank you.

05:00.517 --> 05:02.563
I will await the charge.

05:05.827 --> 05:08.743
Don't you need my password
to do that?

05:08.786 --> 05:10.788
"Tunde123."

05:10.832 --> 05:13.443
You are so predictable.

05:13.487 --> 05:15.793
Yes, I am basic.

05:15.837 --> 05:18.840
Just like my cable was.

05:21.277 --> 05:23.148
I can no longer bear this.

05:23.192 --> 05:27.152
She has turned our home into a
rain forest with movie channels.

05:27.196 --> 05:28.328
Keep your voice down.

05:28.371 --> 05:30.330
She does not know I'm in here.

05:30.373 --> 05:32.375
I do not want to
point fingers,

05:32.419 --> 05:35.160
but this situation is
entirely your fault.

05:35.204 --> 05:37.424
Because she is my sister?

05:37.467 --> 05:38.990
And you refuse to
stand up to her.

05:39.034 --> 05:40.514
If she were my family,

05:40.557 --> 05:42.733
I would tell her she
was not welcome here.

05:42.777 --> 05:43.821
No, you wouldn't.

05:43.865 --> 05:45.257
I would.

05:45.301 --> 05:48.348
Well, you know
where she is. Go tell her.

05:53.048 --> 05:55.093
But she's your sister.

06:02.753 --> 06:04.712
That Dele's credit card?

06:04.755 --> 06:06.104
Not anymore.

06:06.148 --> 06:08.324
You talk to his dad?

06:08.368 --> 06:11.283
Yes. He is
deliberately undermining me.

06:11.327 --> 06:12.850
That's terrible.

06:12.894 --> 06:15.287
Can I say something?

06:15.331 --> 06:17.289
Never mind.

06:17.333 --> 06:19.857
No, I'm gonna say something.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.032
What?

06:21.076 --> 06:22.947
Well, put the scissors down.

06:24.035 --> 06:26.081
I'm not saying you're
wrong about this,

06:26.124 --> 06:29.606
but you're not exactly right.
Just about the credit card.

06:29.650 --> 06:32.740
Everywhere else, you're
batting a thousand.

06:32.783 --> 06:35.656
He is not your son. You do not
tell me how I should raise him.

06:35.699 --> 06:38.180
But he is my stepson.

06:38.223 --> 06:39.616
And while he's here
living with us,

06:39.660 --> 06:41.270
I feel like I should have a say.

06:41.313 --> 06:43.098
Let's call it a step-say.

06:43.141 --> 06:44.795
And what is your step-say?

06:44.839 --> 06:47.145
Dele used that credit card

06:47.189 --> 06:48.973
to go to the supermarket
to buy food,

06:49.017 --> 06:51.323
which he then cooked for us.

06:51.367 --> 06:53.108
Do you have any idea
what I would have done

06:53.151 --> 06:55.415
with a credit
- card at his age?
- What?

06:55.458 --> 06:57.112
I don't know.
Off the top of my head,

06:57.155 --> 06:58.592
I'm gonna say beer,
a little weed,

06:58.635 --> 07:02.073
maybe try to sneak
into a strip club in Canada.

07:02.117 --> 07:05.468
You must have been
a horrible boy.

07:05.512 --> 07:08.036
No. I was a normal boy.

07:08.079 --> 07:10.734
Your kid is a saint.

07:11.822 --> 07:14.042
He's only here for
a few more weeks,

07:14.085 --> 07:17.001
so maybe you could
lighten up on him.

07:17.045 --> 07:20.440
So he can go to a strip club
in Canada?

07:20.483 --> 07:23.399
No! So he can make us breakfast.

07:23.443 --> 07:25.488
I'm not talking
about this anymore.

07:25.532 --> 07:28.317
In fact, I'm not
talking to you at all.

07:28.360 --> 07:29.884
Come on, really?

07:29.927 --> 07:31.451
You know, we're partners!

07:31.494 --> 07:33.583
We're supposed
to talk these things out!

07:33.627 --> 07:36.934
I'm right. I'm so right.

07:36.978 --> 07:39.284
Talking to myself,
but I'm right.

07:43.506 --> 07:45.813
So, Dele,
what have you been doing

07:45.856 --> 07:47.118
since you came to visit?

07:47.162 --> 07:48.250
Mostly cooking.

07:48.293 --> 07:49.643
Oh, like a hobby?

07:49.686 --> 07:51.862
No, it's more like a job.

07:51.906 --> 07:52.950
To make extra money?

07:52.994 --> 07:55.083
I'm not allowed to have money.

07:57.302 --> 07:59.304
Sorry, we started eating.

07:59.348 --> 08:00.567
Some of us couldn't wait.

08:00.610 --> 08:02.482
It was you. You said "eat."

08:02.525 --> 08:04.353
What are you, a stenographer?

08:04.396 --> 08:05.789
That's okay.

08:05.833 --> 08:07.399
You didn't miss
anything. Just Christina

08:07.443 --> 08:09.184
making Dele uncomfortable.

08:10.011 --> 08:12.230
I'm sure it'll happen again.

08:12.274 --> 08:14.972
Sorry to keep you waiting.
Hey, who ate all the moi moi?

08:15.016 --> 08:17.018
Me, me.

08:17.061 --> 08:19.107
Honey, would you pass me
that last piece?

08:20.848 --> 08:22.284
Really? We're doing this?

08:23.372 --> 08:24.678
Is everything okay?

08:24.721 --> 08:26.114
Course it is. Dele's home,

08:26.157 --> 08:27.202
and we're celebrating.

08:27.245 --> 08:28.508
Right?

08:30.901 --> 08:34.383
It doesn't seem
like she's talking to you.

08:34.426 --> 08:35.515
I see that.

08:35.558 --> 08:37.995
- Did you mansplain something?
- What's that?

08:38.039 --> 08:40.824
If I explain it,
then I'm just as bad as you are.

08:40.868 --> 08:44.175
Did you run your mouth about
Dele's credit card situation?

08:44.219 --> 08:46.830
- Good guess.
- Hey, I win!

08:46.874 --> 08:49.529
Everybody stop talking
and just eat.

08:54.229 --> 08:56.666
So, Dele,

08:56.710 --> 08:59.626
you gonna do anything else fun
while you're here?

08:59.669 --> 09:00.975
No.

09:09.026 --> 09:12.116
- Telemarketer?
- Bob.

09:12.160 --> 09:14.510
- You want to talk about it?
- No.

09:14.554 --> 09:16.294
Okay.

09:16.338 --> 09:18.558
He's trying to tell me
how to raise Dele.

09:18.601 --> 09:21.038
Really? I thought he
was smarter than that.

09:21.082 --> 09:23.954
No. He's stupid.

09:25.956 --> 09:28.785
Tayo is stupid.

09:28.829 --> 09:31.266
Men are stupid.

09:32.223 --> 09:34.835
Yes, Auntie Ebun,
she's here.

09:34.878 --> 09:36.358
Would you like to speak to her?

09:37.185 --> 09:38.186
No, of course you don't.

09:38.229 --> 09:39.579
I agree

09:39.622 --> 09:42.494
with you,
she's a terrible daughter.

09:44.540 --> 09:45.846
Okay, Auntie.

09:45.889 --> 09:48.109
Lovely speaking to you. Bye-bye.

09:48.152 --> 09:51.373
Why are you doing this to me?
Call your mother.

09:51.416 --> 09:53.549
I tried to call,
and she refuses to answer.

09:53.593 --> 09:55.899
Huh. Interesting.

09:56.900 --> 09:58.162
What is?

09:58.206 --> 10:01.209
Nothing. Just noticing
some parallels.

10:01.252 --> 10:03.646
Nobody is paralleling.

10:03.690 --> 10:05.430
Well, your mom's
ignoring you

10:05.474 --> 10:07.650
just like you're
ignoring Bob.

10:07.694 --> 10:09.696
- It is different.
- How?

10:09.739 --> 10:12.394
Because I am right
and they are wrong.

10:12.437 --> 10:14.091
Huh.

10:14.135 --> 10:17.921
Is this a Nigerian thing
or an Abishola thing?

10:17.965 --> 10:19.793
It's a Nigerian thing.

10:26.538 --> 10:27.801
Come in.

10:27.844 --> 10:30.064
- Hey, what are you doing?
- Homework.

10:30.107 --> 10:31.935
Come on, I won't rat you out.
What're you really doing?

10:31.979 --> 10:33.458
Homework.

10:33.502 --> 10:35.939
Oh, what have they done to you?

10:37.375 --> 10:41.249
So, listen, I was thinking
about running over to Costco

10:41.292 --> 10:43.207
and buying
one of those new Xboxes

10:43.251 --> 10:45.645
and inviting some friends over
to mess around with it.

10:45.688 --> 10:46.733
You a gamer?

10:46.776 --> 10:48.473
No. Which means
I'll need somebody

10:48.517 --> 10:49.692
to teach me.

10:49.736 --> 10:51.868
Oh, I don't think
my mom would like that.

10:51.912 --> 10:53.783
Oh, she's gonna hate it.

10:53.827 --> 10:55.480
Let's go.

11:11.540 --> 11:13.150
Abishola!

11:13.194 --> 11:15.631
- Hello.
- Ah.

11:15.675 --> 11:17.633
Auntie, Uncle.
What are you doing here?

11:17.677 --> 11:20.549
Oh, we just came
to say hi. Hi.

11:21.681 --> 11:23.987
You have never visited
this hospital,

11:24.031 --> 11:26.686
and you have never said "hi"
in your life.

11:26.729 --> 11:28.470
Cut to the chase.

11:28.513 --> 11:30.690
You have to apologize
to your mother.

11:30.733 --> 11:32.343
So you can move on.

11:32.387 --> 11:34.824
And she can move out.

11:34.868 --> 11:36.086
Did Mummy send you?

11:36.130 --> 11:39.524
She did not. Unless
driving us out of our home

11:39.568 --> 11:41.831
is a form of sending.

11:41.875 --> 11:44.747
I've tried to talk to her.
She will not listen.

11:44.791 --> 11:47.010
I know that. She was
my horrible sister

11:47.054 --> 11:49.143
long before she was
your horrible mother.

11:49.186 --> 11:52.363
I am not saying your mother
is the reason we left Nigeria,

11:52.407 --> 11:55.845
but your mother
is the reason we left Nigeria.

11:55.889 --> 11:57.717
And now

11:57.760 --> 12:00.154
she is here, sucking
the life from us.

12:00.197 --> 12:01.851
While we grow weaker,

12:01.895 --> 12:03.418
her strength
only increases,

12:03.461 --> 12:06.726
like the temperature
in our apartment.

12:06.769 --> 12:08.466
I'm sorry, Auntie and Uncle.

12:08.510 --> 12:10.947
I had no idea
you were suffering like this.

12:10.991 --> 12:12.383
Well, now you do.

12:12.427 --> 12:14.211
Please, Abishola,

12:14.255 --> 12:15.735
we took you in.

12:15.778 --> 12:18.389
We gave you a home.
We were there for you.

12:18.433 --> 12:20.740
We are not saying
you owe us.

12:20.783 --> 12:23.830
But you owe us.

12:30.097 --> 12:31.576
You're very good at this.

12:31.620 --> 12:33.927
When you don't have kids,
you get to stay a kid.

12:33.970 --> 12:36.756
Little life advice
from your Funcle Doug.

12:36.799 --> 12:38.322
I am surprised

12:38.366 --> 12:40.585
his mother is okay
with him playing video games.

12:40.629 --> 12:41.761
She's not.

12:41.804 --> 12:43.675
So, are you trying
to get us all killed

12:43.719 --> 12:45.199
or just the boy?

12:45.242 --> 12:47.723
Dele's only here
for a couple of weeks.

12:47.767 --> 12:49.638
I don't want him locked
in his room doing homework.

12:49.681 --> 12:51.379
I want him
to have some fun.

12:51.422 --> 12:52.815
Good for you, Mr. Wheeler.

12:52.859 --> 12:55.252
Sometimes you just have
to stand your ground

12:55.296 --> 12:57.602
as a man.

12:57.646 --> 12:59.256
Why are you giggling?

12:59.300 --> 13:00.562
Because I live
in your house,

13:00.605 --> 13:02.085
and I hear how you
stand your ground.

13:02.129 --> 13:03.608
You do not understand.

13:03.652 --> 13:05.915
I play the long game.

13:05.959 --> 13:07.874
I pick my battles.

13:07.917 --> 13:10.790
You may pick them, but
you do not win them.

13:12.139 --> 13:14.794
- Hey, Bob, come play.
- Don't mind if I do.

13:15.751 --> 13:17.231
I just got the power sword.

13:17.274 --> 13:19.668
- Can you please not waste it?
- Just give it to me.

13:21.670 --> 13:23.977
You play video games
with your dad?

13:24.020 --> 13:26.675
No way.

13:26.718 --> 13:27.807
Then this'll be our thing.

13:36.946 --> 13:38.121
Who is it?

13:38.165 --> 13:39.906
Mummy, it's Abishola.

13:43.823 --> 13:45.215
Mummy?

13:53.963 --> 13:56.705
Don't get up. I have a key.

13:59.490 --> 14:00.883
<i>Ek'ale,</i> Mummy.

14:07.542 --> 14:09.413
I came to ask
for your forgiveness.

14:10.284 --> 14:13.200
I brought you dark
chocolate, your favorite.

14:24.037 --> 14:26.213
I should not have
challenged you.

14:27.257 --> 14:28.650
You are my mother,
and you deserve

14:28.693 --> 14:30.260
to be treated with respect.

14:31.261 --> 14:32.872
I am foolish

14:32.915 --> 14:34.177
and ungrateful.

14:34.221 --> 14:36.353
You have come very far
to spend time with me,

14:36.397 --> 14:37.964
and I have not
made you feel welcome.

14:43.230 --> 14:46.407
I really wish
you'd speak to me, Mummy.

14:46.450 --> 14:49.062
I could use your guidance
with my son.

14:50.237 --> 14:51.760
What is going on with Dele?

14:51.803 --> 14:54.197
Tayo gave him
a credit card.

14:54.241 --> 14:55.938
Take it away from him
and destroy it.

14:55.982 --> 14:57.200
- I did.
- Good.

14:57.244 --> 14:58.898
Tayo is very angry with me,

14:58.941 --> 15:01.596
but I did not want
him spoiling Dele.

15:01.639 --> 15:03.641
These parents
who want to be friends

15:03.685 --> 15:05.382
and have fun
with their children.

15:05.426 --> 15:07.471
That is not
how you were raised.

15:07.515 --> 15:09.038
- No, it was not, Mummy.
- Mm.

15:09.082 --> 15:10.170
But do not worry.

15:10.213 --> 15:12.563
I have seen you with Dele.

15:12.607 --> 15:13.956
You are not his friend.

15:14.000 --> 15:15.784
He does not have fun
with you.

15:16.785 --> 15:18.700
He's a good boy.

15:18.743 --> 15:20.049
Because you have
denied him everything,

15:20.093 --> 15:22.660
just as I have denied you.

15:22.704 --> 15:24.488
Bob thinks I'm
- overreacting.
- Oh,

15:24.532 --> 15:26.969
what does Bob know?
He is stupid like all men.

15:27.013 --> 15:28.753
- Yes, Mummy.
- Mm.

15:29.754 --> 15:32.453
Get my bags.
I am coming home.

15:32.496 --> 15:34.846
My grandson needs me.

15:34.890 --> 15:36.805
What a coincidence.

15:36.848 --> 15:39.068
Your bags are right here.

15:46.815 --> 15:48.295
Get him! Get him!

15:48.338 --> 15:49.949
Kill the zombie!

15:49.992 --> 15:51.733
- Stop yelling at me!
- I got your back.

15:51.776 --> 15:53.474
- Reload.
- Thank you.

15:53.517 --> 15:55.563
- What is going on here?
- My homework is done.

15:55.606 --> 15:57.565
He made me do this.

15:57.608 --> 15:59.654
I thought you had my back.

15:59.697 --> 16:01.395
- Go to your room, boy.
- Yes, Granny.

16:05.616 --> 16:08.532
I can understand you, you fools.

16:09.533 --> 16:10.795
Okay, we should go.

16:10.839 --> 16:12.580
Good night, everyone.

16:13.537 --> 16:14.974
You bought him this video game?

16:15.017 --> 16:16.410
Oh, good, you're talking to me.

16:16.453 --> 16:17.846
How dare you go behind my back?

16:17.889 --> 16:20.240
Hang on. I flew Dele 6,000 miles

16:20.283 --> 16:22.198
to surprise you
because you missed him.

16:22.242 --> 16:24.635
And I know if he
goes back to Nigeria

16:24.679 --> 16:26.246
after a couple
of miserable weeks here,

16:26.289 --> 16:27.377
he'll never want to come back,

16:27.421 --> 16:28.813
and you'll
never forgive yourself.

16:28.857 --> 16:31.207
You speak
to my daughter this way?

16:31.251 --> 16:33.601
As it turns out, I do.

16:33.644 --> 16:34.994
I see.

16:35.037 --> 16:37.997
Abishola,
listen to your husband.

16:39.302 --> 16:40.564
Excuse me, I had next game.

16:40.608 --> 16:42.305
- Go home, Douglas.
- You done with the pizza?

16:42.349 --> 16:44.568
- Go home!
- You're done.

16:45.613 --> 16:48.050
I love you more than life,

16:48.094 --> 16:49.486
and I know he's your son.

16:49.530 --> 16:51.488
But I love him, too.

16:51.532 --> 16:52.837
There's got to be a way

16:52.881 --> 16:54.404
we work together.

16:57.929 --> 17:00.671
You're right.

17:00.715 --> 17:03.326
We'll find a way.

17:03.370 --> 17:04.893
Thank you.

17:04.936 --> 17:08.070
So, silent treatment's over?

17:08.114 --> 17:09.376
It is over.

17:09.419 --> 17:10.681
Can I get a hug?

17:10.725 --> 17:11.769
Not yet.

17:14.250 --> 17:15.817
I now understand

17:15.860 --> 17:18.211
- why you sent for me.
- You do?

17:18.254 --> 17:22.345
You needed me
to save your marriage.

17:22.389 --> 17:25.261
You're a smart woman.

17:25.305 --> 17:26.436
I am.

17:26.480 --> 17:27.959
Now, where is your thermostat?

17:28.003 --> 17:29.744
It is freezing in here.

17:30.745 --> 17:32.355
Right this way.

17:40.581 --> 17:42.539
- Yeah, mmm.
- It's good, right?

17:42.583 --> 17:45.107
- Dele, you're killing it.
- Dele,

17:45.151 --> 17:46.717
it is good
that you know how to cook.

17:46.761 --> 17:49.372
That way,
your wife can never starve you.

17:49.416 --> 17:50.765
- Mm.
- Yes, Granny.

17:50.808 --> 17:52.767
You should also get to know
the smell of poisons

17:52.810 --> 17:55.552
in case you marry
a jealous woman.

17:55.596 --> 17:57.641
Yes, Granny.

17:59.034 --> 18:00.905
How lucky you are

18:00.949 --> 18:03.212
to have your mother-in-law
back under your roof.

18:03.256 --> 18:06.563
I know we miss the
never-ending stream of wisdom

18:06.607 --> 18:08.217
spilling out of her mouth.

18:08.261 --> 18:10.089
Knock off that smile.

18:10.132 --> 18:11.568
I cannot.

18:11.612 --> 18:13.135
Woof!

18:13.179 --> 18:15.224
I'm sweating off
my Chattahoochee.

18:15.268 --> 18:17.139
What's the thermostat

18:17.183 --> 18:19.098
set to? Hell?

18:19.141 --> 18:20.577
Yes.

18:22.971 --> 18:24.015
I would like

18:24.059 --> 18:25.452
to make a toast.

18:26.583 --> 18:29.151
To Bob, who saw the error

18:29.195 --> 18:31.719
of Abishola's ways
and did not hesitate

18:31.762 --> 18:33.547
to correct them. Hear! Hear!

18:35.157 --> 18:37.681
Yes. To Bob.

18:37.725 --> 18:39.857
I'm screwed, aren't I?

18:39.901 --> 18:41.424
Oh, yes.
