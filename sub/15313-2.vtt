WEBVTT

00:02.760 --> 00:04.239
(Man)
Bring it over here.

00:04.320 --> 00:06.595
Help me get this into a pile.

00:07.720 --> 00:10.188
How?
Joderic will be under orders.

00:10.280 --> 00:12.840
"How” is not for you
to worry about.

00:12.920 --> 00:15.036
I cannot be seen
to take from you.

00:15.120 --> 00:17.111
I cannot even be seen with you.
Our Matthew...

00:17.200 --> 00:18.872
Our Matthew
has work at the castle.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.439
Owen.

00:20.520 --> 00:24.229
Take your wife and family
and get your belongings back into the mill.

00:25.080 --> 00:27.719
Joderic will not
evict you today.

00:37.080 --> 00:38.593
Let's go.

00:38.680 --> 00:40.238
Robin says
you're gonna be all right.

00:40.320 --> 00:42.436
What are you waiting for?

00:42.520 --> 00:43.953
Nothing.

00:44.640 --> 00:47.279
I explained thing to him.
Everything's gonna be all right.

00:47.360 --> 00:50.113
— Oh, please!
— What?

00:50.200 --> 00:54.796
You want to see the look on her face,
don't you? You want to see the gratitude.

01:02.840 --> 01:04.398
(Rob/n) Joderic!

01:09.280 --> 01:10.349
Robin...

01:10.440 --> 01:13.273
Do not interfere.
You know I have to do this.

01:13.360 --> 01:17.194
And you know there are Sheriff's men
on their way to make sure there's no trouble.

01:17.280 --> 01:18.838
Do you have to do this?

01:18.920 --> 01:21.070
I did it under the old Sheriff,
you did not complain.

01:21.160 --> 01:23.628
— That was different.
— How?

01:23.720 --> 01:27.156
Two things are certain in life —
death and taxes.

01:27.240 --> 01:31.631
But when the death is caused by the taxes,
something is rotten.

01:31.720 --> 01:33.039
Take this.

01:33.120 --> 01:36.157
— The miller's debt.
— I cannot.

01:36.240 --> 01:38.231
This is stolen money.

01:38.320 --> 01:41.153
The Sheriff knows
the miller cannot afford it.

01:45.120 --> 01:48.351
I could break it into small amounts.
Pay it in over time.

01:48.440 --> 01:49.793
That would be credible.

01:49.880 --> 01:53.793
Every time somebody breaks bread
in Nettlestone, they will thank you, joderic.

01:53.880 --> 01:56.189
— Sure.
— Do me a favour.

01:57.080 --> 02:00.755
Tell them you have not seen me.
Tell them this was your own scheme.

02:00.840 --> 02:04.150
— Why?
— My friends think I am vain!

02:16.000 --> 02:19.231
He's here to evict us.
Robin did not make it right.

02:19.320 --> 02:20.992
— He said he would fix it.
— How?

02:23.320 --> 02:25.436
Let me get this straight.

02:25.520 --> 02:27.670
We're giving money
to a tax collector?

02:27.760 --> 02:29.113
A bailiff.

02:29.200 --> 02:31.839
Oh, that makes
all the difference.

02:45.120 --> 02:47.031
Owen.

02:47.120 --> 02:48.473
Kate.

02:49.000 --> 02:50.592
As you know,
I am here today...

02:50.680 --> 02:54.434
Didn't you see Robin Hood? He said
he'd speak to you so we wouldn't be evicted.

02:54.520 --> 02:58.195
No. No, I'm sorry...

02:58.280 --> 02:59.838
l have not seen Robin Hood.

03:01.360 --> 03:03.191
But we can work this out.

03:10.920 --> 03:13.229
He's killed him.
Robin's killed him!

03:59.000 --> 04:00.877
Oi, stop!

04:19.200 --> 04:20.838
Master!

04:24.440 --> 04:27.398
What, you can't believe
someone's better than you?

04:27.480 --> 04:29.596
— He kicked you good.
— Who is he?

04:29.680 --> 04:31.636
The Nightwatchman.

04:31.720 --> 04:36.635
— Well, I've never heard of him.
— The Nightwatchman? Been around for years.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.029
Maybe you were off
on a crusade.

04:39.120 --> 04:40.951
He's a good man.

04:41.040 --> 04:43.110
He's talked about
in all the villages.

04:43.200 --> 04:46.988
He's been seen in Nottingham.
Even at the castle. Always at night.

04:47.080 --> 04:49.275
Leaves medicine and stuff.
Food.

04:50.320 --> 04:54.632
Sheriff's men are ordered to shoot him
on sight but he's never hurt a fly.

04:54.720 --> 04:57.029
Why did he kill joderic, then?

04:58.520 --> 05:00.272
We need to find him.

05:02.520 --> 05:08.038
The villagers of Nettlestone report
that Robin Hood...

05:08.120 --> 05:10.873
killed an innocent
bailiff today.

05:10.960 --> 05:13.155
This is marvellous, isn't it?

05:13.240 --> 05:14.992
What drama!

05:15.080 --> 05:17.833
Because now even
his beloved villagers

05:17.920 --> 05:21.833
will lose patience when their heroes
start picking them off.

05:21.920 --> 05:24.434
What else are they saying?

05:24.520 --> 05:27.910
Hood was fulfilling a promise
to prevent an eviction.

05:29.280 --> 05:33.068
War has addled his brain.
I'm not at all surprised.

05:33.160 --> 05:35.754
So, what do you
propose we do?

05:36.920 --> 05:41.118
— Immediate reprisals against villages.
— Joderic would not want that.

05:41.200 --> 05:45.398
Why should more innocent people suffer
because of his death?

05:45.480 --> 05:49.189
The same people who
witnessed and reported the crime.

05:50.200 --> 05:53.875
And did this strategy of reprisals
work in the villages before?

05:55.120 --> 05:56.553
No.

05:57.480 --> 05:59.357
Marian is right.

06:01.080 --> 06:04.868
We will not be going down that road again.
De Fourtnoy — alternatives?

06:05.840 --> 06:09.389
There is a...
political advantage to be had here.

06:10.520 --> 06:14.149
Robin Hood has given us the high ground.
We should keep it, my thoughts exactly.

06:14.240 --> 06:17.391
We could have the town criers
announce what's taken place.

06:17.480 --> 06:21.234
Make sure everybody knows that
an innocent was killed.

06:21.320 --> 06:23.117
Good.

06:24.480 --> 06:27.472
We are going to win
hearts and minds.

06:28.920 --> 06:30.478
My lord.

06:30.560 --> 06:33.279
I still believe actions
rather than words...

06:34.080 --> 06:38.198
If I had the resources I could deal with him,
I could hunt him down...

06:38.280 --> 06:42.034
Very well.
We'll do both and may the best man win.

06:48.120 --> 06:50.076
Joderic was unique.

06:51.200 --> 06:54.829
He was kind,
compassionate, learned.

06:56.680 --> 06:58.398
The murder of the bailiff...

06:58.480 --> 07:01.597
We'll leave as soon
as Joderic's buried.

07:01.680 --> 07:04.399
We can say
you were too upset.

07:04.480 --> 07:06.471
I am too upset.

07:08.360 --> 07:12.114
(Sher/f0 In response to this change
of direction from Robin Hood...

07:12.200 --> 07:16.876
Joe?
What are you doing here?

07:16.960 --> 07:18.837
You cannot work.

07:19.680 --> 07:22.478
They've made
everyone come back in.

07:22.560 --> 07:24.357
Called me out of retirement.

07:24.440 --> 07:26.590
I will talk to the Sheriff.

07:26.680 --> 07:29.672
I'll get you off your duties.

07:29.760 --> 07:31.671
Work helps.

07:31.760 --> 07:33.796
(Sher/ff)
a war on terror! These people...

07:33.880 --> 07:36.758
I still reach out for her in the night,
I know it's daft...

07:36.840 --> 07:38.671
It is not daft.

07:38.760 --> 07:41.433
When all this is over
you are coming home with us.

07:41.520 --> 07:44.478
(Sher/ff)
of our humanity and of our innocence.

07:44.560 --> 07:47.279
(Smatter/ng of applause)

07:47.360 --> 07:55.517
All this is gone in one moment,
with one arrow fired from the bow

07:55.600 --> 07:56.555
of Robin Hood.

07:56.640 --> 07:59.393
— He is saying you killed joderic!
— Of course he is.

07:59.480 --> 08:02.074
Yes, but he's making us
look like criminals!

08:02.160 --> 08:03.912
— You know we are criminals.
— What?

08:04.000 --> 08:06.719
Are we suddenly
something else?

08:06.800 --> 08:11.920
between stability,
order, authority...

08:12.680 --> 08:17.754
or the random, chaotic cruelty of Robin Hood
and all outlaws like him.

08:17.840 --> 08:22.231
This cowardly crime, this murder,
will be punished.

08:22.320 --> 08:25.949
We will hunt Hood down,
with dogs if necessary,

08:26.040 --> 08:28.554
and we will ensure
that he does not succeed,

08:28.640 --> 08:32.110
We will not be cowed,
this is what he wants...

08:32.200 --> 08:34.953
You never shoot me,
understand?

08:39.480 --> 08:42.517
This, this is all in my honour,
isn't it?

08:42.600 --> 08:44.750
You really do think everything
is about you, don't you?

08:44.840 --> 08:48.276
— Only when it is about me!
— You have given him a stick to beat you with.

08:48.360 --> 08:51.511
You killed an innocent clerk
and now here he is making the most of it.

08:51.600 --> 08:54.990
— I did not do it.
— I'm sure.

08:55.080 --> 08:57.878
It was the so—called non—violent
Nightwatchman.

08:57.960 --> 09:00.474
— No!
— I saw him.

09:00.560 --> 09:02.312
— l was there.
— It was not the Nightwatchman.

09:02.400 --> 09:03.753
— How do you know?
— I know.

09:03.840 --> 09:06.877
— Then why did he run?
— Why did you run from joderic?

09:09.960 --> 09:11.871
I should go.

09:12.560 --> 09:14.198
— You must help me.
— I am helping you.

09:14.280 --> 09:15.793
I'm telling you it was not
the Nightwatchman.

09:15.880 --> 09:17.393
Whoever it is.

09:17.480 --> 09:20.995
I will find him and I can look
everywhere apart from one place.

09:22.120 --> 09:25.271
— I need you to look in the castle.
— I need you to not tell me what to do.

09:25.360 --> 09:27.794
Please!
I must clear my name.

09:27.880 --> 09:31.270
What about catching the killer?
Isn't that more important than your name?

09:31.360 --> 09:34.716
If people do not trust me,
then what good can I do?

09:36.840 --> 09:38.592
I'll try.

09:42.920 --> 09:47.596
Tell me, De Fourtnoy. ls Master at Arms
just a ceremonial position now?

09:47.680 --> 09:52.754
Because problems like Hood
demand real solutions.

09:52.840 --> 09:54.193
Town criers?

09:54.280 --> 09:56.919
( Dogs barking)

10:00.040 --> 10:02.110
Sir Guy.

10:02.200 --> 10:03.997
Marian.

10:04.080 --> 10:05.559
All these dogs for one man?

10:05.640 --> 10:07.915
Yeah, it was my idea.

10:08.800 --> 10:11.189
The Master at Arms
would have us doing nothing.

10:11.280 --> 10:13.350
You are in competition?

10:13.440 --> 10:17.558
He's a little man, promoted too far.
Anyone would make a better Master at Arms.

10:17.640 --> 10:20.996
Politics. Even when my father
was the Sheriff,

10:21.080 --> 10:23.799
I could not grasp
the intricacies.

10:23.880 --> 10:25.233
He sent me here,
by the way.

10:25.320 --> 10:28.153
He thinks it is safer,
with a killer on the loose.

10:28.240 --> 10:30.629
You say "a killer"?
You do not think it is Hood?

10:31.960 --> 10:36.078
Whoever it is, he thought it would be safer
here in the castle.

10:36.760 --> 10:38.637
No, that's not permitted.

10:39.440 --> 10:40.668
Oh.

10:44.320 --> 10:46.390
I'll talk to the Sheriff.

10:47.680 --> 10:49.432
Thank you, Sir Guy.

10:51.880 --> 10:54.474
Right. I want a line sweeping
south through the forest.

10:54.560 --> 10:57.074
Let's show De Fourtnoy how to
hunt down Robin Hood.

10:57.160 --> 10:59.799
With these dogs, he will run.

11:04.840 --> 11:06.193
( Dogs barking)

11:07.280 --> 11:08.838
This I do not like.

11:14.680 --> 11:18.070
The King's Guild of Hunters and Foresters.
Coming this way.

11:19.040 --> 11:19.950
Dogs!

11:28.880 --> 11:32.077
Pairs.
Meet where we stored the provisions.

11:45.360 --> 11:47.635
— (Grow/mg)
— Faster!

11:56.880 --> 11:58.871
(Birds twittering)

12:13.880 --> 12:16.075
Matthew, am | left—handed?

12:17.200 --> 12:18.792
A clue...

12:19.880 --> 12:20.915
No!

12:21.000 --> 12:23.150
Sorry, sir.

12:33.320 --> 12:34.514
Stand on one leg.

12:37.480 --> 12:39.357
The right one.

12:40.480 --> 12:42.152
One hour.

12:42.240 --> 12:44.913
That might help you
to remember, hm?

12:47.440 --> 12:48.714
So...

12:49.880 --> 12:52.553
New boy, how're you finding
your new job? Hm?

12:54.960 --> 12:58.111
Oh, don't worry.
You know, you're a lucky boy.

12:58.200 --> 13:03.752
Now your daddy's mill is shut, you could be
running through the forest chased by hounds.

13:06.600 --> 13:08.158
Guards! Guards!

13:09.480 --> 13:10.833
Raise the alarm!

13:14.720 --> 13:17.518
In my own room? In my own room?
Where are the men?

13:17.600 --> 13:20.956
Gisborne has taken them
to hunt Hood with the dogs.

13:21.040 --> 13:22.155
Gisborne is a fool.

13:22.240 --> 13:24.800
Evidently,
Hood has evaded him.

13:24.880 --> 13:26.359
This is nothing to do
with Robin Hood.

13:26.440 --> 13:30.115
Now, you lock down this castle. Tell Gisborne
to scrap the dogs and find the killer!

13:30.200 --> 13:31.349
Yes, my lord.

13:36.040 --> 13:37.109
Stop!

13:38.320 --> 13:40.788
Now, you tell Gisborne
to double the dogs.

13:40.880 --> 13:42.996
My lord, I thought you said
it could not be Hood.

13:43.080 --> 13:44.593
Two words — mud sticks.

13:44.680 --> 13:48.309
Hood's been blamed for one death,
let's blame him for two.

13:48.400 --> 13:51.551
Meanwhile, you find out
who's really responsible for this.

13:51.640 --> 13:53.198
Yes, my lord.

14:10.760 --> 14:13.194
(Kate sobbing)

14:27.560 --> 14:31.792
We pray for Matthew's soul
as he journeys to a better place.

14:33.680 --> 14:37.070
Watch over us Matthew,
and be proud.

14:38.480 --> 14:41.153
We will bring Robin Hood
to justice.

14:42.280 --> 14:44.271
You have my word.

14:56.200 --> 14:57.792
I don't believe it!

14:57.880 --> 14:59.996
— The soldiers found it.
— (Much) No!

15:01.240 --> 15:03.151
That was our...

15:03.240 --> 15:05.595
— That was our store.
— They destroyed everything.

15:05.680 --> 15:07.557
That was our food!

15:20.040 --> 15:23.112
What is going on?
I am hiding in my own castle.

15:23.200 --> 15:26.431
I cannot move in my own castle.
Get out! Get out!

15:26.520 --> 15:30.718
We will not leave a stone unturned, my lord.
The killer will be found.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.917
You will not leave a stone unturned,
he will be found, la—di—da—di—da...

15:34.000 --> 15:35.399
Get on with it, then!

15:47.560 --> 15:50.120
How is Gisborne
doing with Locksley?

15:50.200 --> 15:53.909
More dogs have been brought in
but the outlaw is still on the run.

15:55.680 --> 15:57.955
Have you put it about that
he's killed at least twice?

15:58.040 --> 16:00.474
— Yes, my lord.
— Good.

16:00.560 --> 16:02.676
Do you think...

16:03.320 --> 16:05.550
two deaths are enough?
Hm?

16:06.480 --> 16:09.040
To get them to really turn against him,
the rebel?

16:10.480 --> 16:13.392
If we're going to blame Hood,
let's do it properly.

16:13.480 --> 16:16.392
What do you think?
Hm?

16:16.480 --> 16:19.597
I think maybe a few more deaths.
It'd be interesting.

16:19.680 --> 16:22.956
You know, pretty deaths, not just boys,
but pretty deaths.

16:35.880 --> 16:36.869
(Screams)

16:38.880 --> 16:40.199
Guards!

16:40.280 --> 16:42.236
Quickly, the cloisters.

16:43.480 --> 16:45.994
(Be/l tolling)

16:49.880 --> 16:52.474
Lady Marian, come away,
if you please.

16:52.560 --> 16:55.074
How could this happen?
I thought you had the castle locked down.

16:55.160 --> 16:57.993
You must go back to your room,
it is not safe here.

17:11.240 --> 17:15.119
What is going on here?
Three people have been killed under your nose.

17:15.200 --> 17:17.475
— Well, that is unfortunate.
— It's incompetent!

17:17.560 --> 17:20.836
What have you achieved?
You found the remnants of a picnic,

17:20.920 --> 17:24.390
— but Robin Hood, no!
— At least I found something, unlike you!

17:24.480 --> 17:27.790
Shut up!
Couple of women!

17:27.880 --> 17:29.518
Grow up!

17:34.080 --> 17:37.072
Forgive me,
all these killings...

17:37.160 --> 17:40.550
They are attributed to Robin Hood
but what proof is there?

17:40.640 --> 17:44.030
There were no witnesses.
How could he have moved about the castle

17:44.120 --> 17:45.872
unchallenged by your guards?

17:45.960 --> 17:50.431
And you yourself must have been there
moments before the maid was killed?

17:50.520 --> 17:52.192
That I cannot recall.

17:52.280 --> 17:54.999
And from one point of view,
the killings have been useful, no?

17:55.080 --> 17:57.548
Given you the chance
to shine?

18:05.960 --> 18:10.112
— Did she see you?
— She's guessing, my lord. She's a girl.

18:37.080 --> 18:39.310
Do you think
Will will bring some water?

18:41.080 --> 18:44.993
A bit of bread wouldn't go amiss.
Perhaps some cheese.

18:46.480 --> 18:51.634
We're going to be captured,
tortured and hanged...

18:52.480 --> 18:54.710
and he wants cheese?

18:55.480 --> 18:57.596
( Dogs barking)

18:57.680 --> 18:59.750
Ohh...
Don't they ever give up?

19:08.120 --> 19:09.838
Master, the dogs.

19:11.280 --> 19:14.909
— We cannot stay. There's too many of them.
— Well, we must do something.

19:15.880 --> 19:18.792
We are running away
when we should be in pursuit.

19:18.880 --> 19:21.678
The Nightwatchman
is still out there.

19:34.320 --> 19:35.833
We head east.

19:35.920 --> 19:37.638
Back to Nettlestone.

19:47.680 --> 19:50.877
(Man) Get out of our village,
you're not welcome.

19:52.560 --> 19:53.709
Hello.

19:53.800 --> 19:56.997
Excuse me. Do you know if the
Nightwatchman has been back here again?

19:58.160 --> 19:59.991
Has the Nightwatchman
been back at all?

20:00.080 --> 20:03.197
Do you have any food?
Any water? Anything. We are weary.

20:03.280 --> 20:06.431
— (Woman) You'll hang for what you've done!
— You killed my son!

20:06.520 --> 20:08.556
What? Matthew's dead?

20:10.280 --> 20:12.430
— You deny it?
— Yes!

20:13.240 --> 20:15.117
— Kate, you know me!
— And Joderic.

20:15.200 --> 20:18.670
You told me you'd see to him.
If I'd known you would kill him...

20:18.760 --> 20:21.991
Owen, I swear,
I could never hurt Matthew.

20:22.080 --> 20:24.150
Matthew?
Don't you say his name.

20:24.240 --> 20:26.071
Don't you put his name
in your mouth.

20:26.160 --> 20:27.878
I swear,
I never killed Matthew.

20:27.960 --> 20:31.157
— I didn't kill Joderic.
— No, and you didn't kill those others either?

20:31.240 --> 20:32.912
What others?

20:34.920 --> 20:37.388
I hope they draw your guts out
and quarter you.

20:37.480 --> 20:39.755
We didn't do it!
We didn't do any of it!

20:39.840 --> 20:41.478
Hold them for the Sheriff!

20:42.680 --> 20:44.033
Enough!

20:44.120 --> 20:47.351
You don't understand!
I'm fighting for you!

20:48.720 --> 20:51.996
The Sheriff hangs people
for stealing bread.

20:52.080 --> 20:53.877
He cuts out their tongues!

20:55.360 --> 20:56.713
He divides us...

20:58.680 --> 21:01.433
(Much)
We're going! Let's get out of here!

21:01.520 --> 21:03.511
( Villagers shouting aggressive/y)

21:04.800 --> 21:07.439
— Let me through, let me through!
— Stay back!

21:11.080 --> 21:12.433
Stay there!

21:14.080 --> 21:16.230
(Man)
Leave 'em be, you son of a cur!

21:24.560 --> 21:26.790
I walked away
from my home.

21:27.720 --> 21:28.994
For them!

21:29.080 --> 21:31.310
I gave myself up
to the Sheriff for them!

21:31.400 --> 21:33.436
We gave Joderic money
for them.

21:33.520 --> 21:35.590
I never really
did understand that.

21:40.440 --> 21:42.396
It's the tag.

21:43.640 --> 21:46.200
l refined it.
You can't copy it now.

21:46.280 --> 21:49.477
It's only me and my dad know how
to do edges like that.

21:49.560 --> 21:51.357
It's good.

21:52.280 --> 21:53.998
It's good.

22:01.280 --> 22:02.872
Sorry, my lady,
you can't come through here.

22:02.960 --> 22:04.996
I've come to see
Sergeant Lacey.

22:05.080 --> 22:06.991
l'll deal with this.

22:10.080 --> 22:12.435
You shouldn't be here, Marian.
It's not safe.

22:12.520 --> 22:14.431
I know, thank you.

22:14.520 --> 22:16.033
It's all right.

22:16.120 --> 22:17.917
It's not though, is it?

22:21.680 --> 22:22.908
No.

22:23.640 --> 22:26.871
Who'd have thought.
Robin a killer.

22:28.880 --> 22:31.155
All these people dead.

22:31.240 --> 22:33.071
I can't understand.

22:34.280 --> 22:36.032
Matthew...

22:37.400 --> 22:40.631
His poor mum and dad...
I know how they feel.

22:42.000 --> 22:44.150
It was the same with Ruth.

22:46.280 --> 22:48.475
You try not to dwell on it.

22:49.800 --> 22:51.836
Remember the good times.

22:54.480 --> 22:58.712
The only thing I regret is that
she didn't die in her own bed.

22:59.480 --> 23:01.072
That I cannot...

23:25.600 --> 23:27.238
John!

23:27.880 --> 23:29.950
I need you to take over.

23:30.560 --> 23:31.993
l have to go to the castle.

23:32.080 --> 23:35.038
Enough is enough.
We stop running, now!

23:35.120 --> 23:37.509
— You're not gonna give yourself in again?
— Not this time.

23:37.600 --> 23:40.592
— I've got some ideas for how you could get in.
- Go on.

23:40.680 --> 23:43.558
— Do you want clever or really clever?
— I want fast.

23:44.880 --> 23:49.396
From here, could I shoot an arrow
through that window?

23:50.920 --> 23:53.912
Pull smoothly
like you're combing your hair.

24:02.840 --> 24:04.398
You could.

24:05.480 --> 24:07.357
But of course I wouldn't.

24:11.080 --> 24:13.548
You're teasing me,
aren't you?

24:19.480 --> 24:21.948
Yeah, I'll say anything,
I will.

24:23.000 --> 24:25.150
I'm from the days
when you could.

24:25.240 --> 24:27.435
Nowadays,
we hold our tongues,

24:27.520 --> 24:29.829
those of us lucky enough
to still have them.

24:30.920 --> 24:33.354
We say one thing
when we mean another.

24:35.600 --> 24:37.192
For instance...

24:38.360 --> 24:43.798
Well, you say you want archery lessons
but you're really only interested in bow range.

24:49.280 --> 24:52.397
You're trying to prove it
couldn't be him.

24:52.480 --> 24:55.040
— You still love him?
— No.

24:58.400 --> 24:59.515
VVho?

25:02.400 --> 25:03.799
Tell him.

25:04.440 --> 25:06.715
Not that you ever see him,
but tell him.

25:08.080 --> 25:10.036
Good people
do still love him.

26:16.760 --> 26:18.512
(Muff/ed screams)

26:25.720 --> 26:29.110
Why can it never be
a beautiful woman?

26:30.080 --> 26:31.354
Call off your dogs.

26:31.440 --> 26:33.795
Why? You're a mad killer.

26:33.880 --> 26:35.552
You know I'm not.

26:36.600 --> 26:37.874
It's true.

26:39.680 --> 26:44.037
So, now we've got that sorted,
want do you want to do, slit the other wrist?

26:44.120 --> 26:46.315
It seems to me that somebody
wants you dead.

26:46.400 --> 26:50.598
Well, what's new?
Welcome to my world.

26:51.760 --> 26:54.320
I came into
your room unseen.

26:55.080 --> 26:58.993
If the killer is half as good as me,
he will do the same.

27:00.840 --> 27:02.671
And your point is...?

27:02.760 --> 27:04.398
I can catch him for you.

27:08.960 --> 27:10.109
Mm.

27:10.880 --> 27:12.791
Two questions.

27:14.120 --> 27:15.792
How?

27:17.000 --> 27:18.752
And why?

27:18.840 --> 27:21.035
Ride through Nettlestone Village.

27:21.760 --> 27:25.435
Parade yourself.
Make sure everybody knows you're there.

27:26.040 --> 27:29.476
That will draw out the killer
and my men will shoot him.

27:29.560 --> 27:32.199
— What about my men?
— Because mine are invisible.

27:34.240 --> 27:36.117
Supposing...

27:36.880 --> 27:38.836
I agree.

27:41.160 --> 27:42.639
Why?

27:45.080 --> 27:47.799
Innocent people
are being killed.

27:48.880 --> 27:50.871
I cannot allow that.

27:53.480 --> 27:55.835
Oh, come on, Robin.

27:57.960 --> 28:00.793
This is pillow talk, isn't it?
Hm?

28:02.080 --> 28:04.992
Oh, come on,
you can be honest with me.

28:05.080 --> 28:07.196
That's not
the real reason, is it?

28:07.280 --> 28:10.192
Do you want to know
what the real reason is?

28:11.280 --> 28:12.952
Nobody loves you any more.

28:13.040 --> 28:14.632
Hm?

28:15.520 --> 28:18.751
They've turned against you.
The common serfs.

28:20.560 --> 28:23.711
And really, those are the people
that love you the most.

28:23.800 --> 28:25.870
That's what you can't allow
to happen.

28:25.960 --> 28:30.192
— Do we have an agreement?
— Oh, have I touched a sore point?

28:30.280 --> 28:32.157
I'll take that as a yes.

28:33.360 --> 28:35.794
And by the way, this...

28:35.880 --> 28:37.791
is for you.

28:38.280 --> 28:40.077
For future reference.

28:40.680 --> 28:42.716
Anybody wearing
one of those...

28:42.800 --> 28:44.631
is with me.

28:46.000 --> 28:47.638
Sweet!

28:47.720 --> 28:50.393
Robin...
Does it go with my dress?

28:56.080 --> 28:57.638
Hm?

29:24.080 --> 29:25.479
I'm sorry, my lady.

29:27.680 --> 29:30.478
So, this is you
with your hair down?

29:31.640 --> 29:33.631
— You cannot be here.
— Shh!

29:36.560 --> 29:39.154
Do not be such a spoilsport,
Marian.

29:43.800 --> 29:46.394
I've been trying to think about
who could've done this.

29:46.480 --> 29:49.233
I think the killer is De Fourtnoy,
the Master at Arms.

29:49.320 --> 29:50.469
Because?

29:50.560 --> 29:53.120
He was right there
when the maid was killed.

29:53.200 --> 29:56.670
And a murderer on the loose
merely consolidates his position.

29:56.760 --> 30:01.197
— This situation is in his interests.
— Well, I intend to change this situation.

30:01.280 --> 30:03.840
You think just because you want
to change things, you can.

30:03.920 --> 30:06.753
It's hard to change the things
you do not want to change.

30:06.840 --> 30:11.197
— What about just getting away while you can?
— Why? When we're having so much fun?

30:11.280 --> 30:15.193
— Oh, does anything touch you, Robin?
— What does that mean?

30:15.280 --> 30:20.070
It means you wander around as if nothing could
hurt you, as if arrows would bounce off you.

30:20.160 --> 30:22.799
I do not think
l have ever seen you hurt.

30:22.880 --> 30:25.030
Oh, I have been hurt.

30:25.120 --> 30:26.758
Tell me.

30:27.440 --> 30:29.556
Hm? See?

30:30.600 --> 30:33.512
You think it is strong
not to feel.

30:33.600 --> 30:38.276
But if you cannot admit you feel,
how can you understand when others feel?

30:38.360 --> 30:42.399
— How can you be a whole man?
— | feel when innocent people are shot down.

30:42.480 --> 30:44.789
| feel when my men
are hunted like animals.

30:44.880 --> 30:47.235
| feel when good people
turn against me.

30:49.480 --> 30:51.789
l was talking about you
to someone today.

30:52.480 --> 30:54.038
A good man.

30:54.120 --> 30:57.795
Somebody who still remembers you
from the old days.

30:59.880 --> 31:03.429
And, you know,
there are still people who love you.

31:04.400 --> 31:05.116
(Knock on door)

31:05.200 --> 31:06.633
— My lady!
— One moment...

31:06.720 --> 31:08.915
— I must search your room.
- Go! Out!

31:10.280 --> 31:13.397
By the way,
your investigations...

31:13.480 --> 31:15.118
Good work!

31:16.400 --> 31:18.277
Let's see if
you're right tomorrow.

31:19.960 --> 31:22.155
— Shh.
— My lady!

31:22.240 --> 31:25.152
You got the Sheriff
to call off the dogs?

31:25.240 --> 31:26.673
How?

31:28.040 --> 31:29.029
Pillow talk.

31:29.120 --> 31:31.076
Have you been
in bed with the Sheriff?

31:31.160 --> 31:33.230
l brokered a deal.

31:33.920 --> 31:37.037
We do not deal
with the Sheriff.

31:38.120 --> 31:40.998
Tomorrow...
we save his life.

31:41.080 --> 31:42.433
What?

31:42.520 --> 31:46.479
Can we argue about that tomorrow?
Today, if there are no dogs...

31:46.560 --> 31:47.959
I would like to sleep.

31:48.040 --> 31:50.395
— No, l have a better idea.
— Another one?

31:50.480 --> 31:53.313
If it's as good as saving the Sheriff's life,
I'm with cheese boy.

31:53.400 --> 31:56.631
Did they find the food we stored
at the long stone?

31:58.360 --> 32:01.397
(Rob/n) If we were killers,
would we bring them food?

32:01.480 --> 32:04.677
— lt proves we are not killers.
— (Much) But they hate us.

32:06.600 --> 32:09.717
Now the mill is closed,
the village will be suffering.

32:09.800 --> 32:11.677
They will be hungry.

32:12.920 --> 32:16.356
— You just want everyone to love you.
— I do not want to be branded a killer.

32:16.440 --> 32:18.795
— It is different.
— You want to be loved!

32:19.800 --> 32:23.076
And | tell you something,
it's not fair.

32:23.160 --> 32:25.594
I love you and no one
gives me any food.

32:25.680 --> 32:29.150
— Yet people who do not love you are fed.
— Ah! Come on!

32:29.240 --> 32:30.798
The world is wrong.

32:30.880 --> 32:35.670
We are feeding people who do not love us
and saving a man who wants us dead.

32:35.760 --> 32:37.751
I've changed my mind.

32:37.840 --> 32:40.593
| no longer love you.
Now can I eat?

33:23.840 --> 33:25.751
I am no killer.

33:27.680 --> 33:30.797
I bring food
to show my goodwill.

33:34.280 --> 33:36.157
I am your friend.

33:37.800 --> 33:40.439
My men
are tired and hungry.

33:44.800 --> 33:46.711
This is the last of our food.

33:54.880 --> 33:56.472
Owen...

33:57.360 --> 33:59.510
You are using us.

33:59.600 --> 34:01.636
You and the Sheriff.

34:01.720 --> 34:03.278
I am not.

34:03.360 --> 34:07.512
Fighting your own personal battle,
using us as pawns.

34:07.600 --> 34:09.636
What gifts
will he bring later?

34:12.280 --> 34:16.796
(Gisborne) Fellow Englishmen,
your Sheriff and I bring you a gift.

34:16.880 --> 34:21.590
That gift is a reminder that we are free
and we should walk free.

34:23.280 --> 34:27.068
Today, your Sheriff
and | show no fear.

34:28.080 --> 34:29.911
Today,
we defy Robin Hood.

34:30.880 --> 34:34.634
Today, we walk among you
to show that life goes on.

34:34.720 --> 34:39.430
We will not hide or cower
in the face of outlaws.

34:41.040 --> 34:45.272
We will not change our lives
to suit their campaigns of terror.

34:46.880 --> 34:52.034
We hold our heads high.
Laws exist to protect us.

34:52.120 --> 34:58.150
If we allow Robin Hood to flout these laws and
support him when he undermines basic justice,

34:59.200 --> 35:01.873
then where will he stop?

35:03.560 --> 35:06.950
We give him the right to ignore
another law, and another,

35:07.040 --> 35:09.793
finally to condone
the taking of a human life.

35:10.760 --> 35:13.832
For that too is a law
made to protect us.

35:13.920 --> 35:18.232
Your Sheriff and | share your horror
at the murder of innocents.

35:18.320 --> 35:20.959
And we stand here today
to show...

35:22.920 --> 35:24.672
(Screaming)

35:48.760 --> 35:50.796
What do you think
you're doing?

35:50.880 --> 35:52.996
You're killing innocent people.

35:53.080 --> 35:55.071
What kind of a man are you?

35:59.680 --> 36:01.398
Marian!

36:04.680 --> 36:06.955
— You're the Nightwatchman?
— There's no time for this.

36:07.040 --> 36:08.712
I know who's trying
to kill the Sheriff.

36:08.800 --> 36:11.997
— It's Joe.
— Joe Lacey?

36:15.160 --> 36:16.673
Joe!

36:20.120 --> 36:22.076
Put it down.

36:22.640 --> 36:24.710
Put the bow down, joe.

36:27.400 --> 36:30.836
— You let me do this, Robin.
— W hy did you kill them, Joe?

36:32.240 --> 36:33.514
My Ruth.

36:34.760 --> 36:37.399
She worked all her life
in the castle.

36:38.280 --> 36:41.795
When she lay dying,
where was the Sheriff?

36:41.880 --> 36:44.633
Did he come and visit?
Did he send food?

36:45.560 --> 36:46.788
No.

36:46.880 --> 36:49.997
He sent joderic
because we hadn't paid our taxes.

36:50.080 --> 36:53.595
He put us out
and she died like a dog on the street.

36:53.680 --> 36:55.477
And now, so will he.

36:55.560 --> 36:58.791
You kill that Sheriff,
Prince john will send another one.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.077
And the people of that village will be tortured
because the Sheriff died there.

37:02.160 --> 37:04.151
It's just me, then.

37:05.320 --> 37:09.393
Am I the only man in Nottingham
who can say what he likes? Do what he likes?

37:09.480 --> 37:11.277
Matthew, the miller's boy?

37:11.360 --> 37:13.715
That was an accident.
The Sheriff moved.

37:13.800 --> 37:16.951
And the Sheriff moved the next day
when you killed three more?

37:17.040 --> 37:19.315
Stable boys
and washerwomen?

37:20.960 --> 37:24.350
The Sheriff's leaving.
Let me do this terrible thing, Robin.

37:24.440 --> 37:25.714
No.

37:28.400 --> 37:29.799
Put it down.

37:29.880 --> 37:32.155
Joe, put it down.

37:33.240 --> 37:35.196
I will shoot you.

37:55.040 --> 37:56.439
I did it, Ruth.

37:57.760 --> 37:59.751
I shot the Sheriff.

38:02.360 --> 38:03.839
No!

38:04.880 --> 38:06.472
You shot the Deputy.

38:07.080 --> 38:09.310
My lookalike.

38:27.760 --> 38:29.398
(Mar/an) Poor Joe.

38:30.480 --> 38:33.950
I understand his grief.
But why did he kill so many?

38:35.680 --> 38:37.033
He didn't.

38:38.280 --> 38:41.033
— Who did?
— Let's go.

39:01.560 --> 39:03.516
What now, Locksley? Hm?

39:03.600 --> 39:06.194
(G/r/y voice)
"Oh, I will kill you, I mean it.

39:06.280 --> 39:07.998
"I mean it."

39:08.080 --> 39:11.390
Lacey had no reason to kill stable boys
and washerwomen.

39:11.480 --> 39:13.391
But you did.

39:13.480 --> 39:16.870
lt suited you to have people think
l was the killer.

39:17.720 --> 39:19.711
Interesting idea.
I wish I'd thought of it.

39:19.800 --> 39:21.392
You did.

39:21.960 --> 39:23.029
Admit it.

39:23.120 --> 39:28.194
How could I admit it? You swore that
you'd kill me if I ever did such a thing.

39:30.280 --> 39:32.032
I meant it.

39:33.680 --> 39:35.352
And that's why...

39:35.440 --> 39:37.556
no one will ever know.

39:57.120 --> 39:59.873
— My lord, let me send my men after him.
— No, too late for that.

39:59.960 --> 40:02.269
But I do have
another job for you.

40:09.440 --> 40:11.271
Oh, Gisborne, it's you.

40:12.120 --> 40:13.314
Excuse me.

40:15.520 --> 40:19.957
I just came to inform you that
I'm to be the new Master at Arms.

40:23.320 --> 40:25.709
I don't believe you.

40:25.800 --> 40:29.554
I'd need to hear that
from the Sheriff himself.

40:29.640 --> 40:32.108
That will not be possible,
I'm afraid.

40:35.200 --> 40:38.397
I have been a loyal servant.

40:39.320 --> 40:42.073
— I have...
— What?

40:44.800 --> 40:46.916
I've even killed for him.

40:47.760 --> 40:50.991
Yeah, the Sheriff
thought you might say that.

40:51.480 --> 40:55.996
Which is why...
I am to be the new Master at Arms.

41:14.080 --> 41:16.389
Can I ask you a question?

41:16.480 --> 41:20.393
Why do they call you the Nightwatchman
when you come out in the day?

41:20.480 --> 41:24.189
I don't normally.
You know I can't be seen.

41:24.280 --> 41:26.589
And I did not choose
the name.

41:26.680 --> 41:30.355
Anyway.
You do not need to do it any more.

41:30.440 --> 41:31.793
Day or night.

41:31.880 --> 41:35.475
— Now you're here, you mean?
— Yes.

41:36.080 --> 41:38.753
My father
had me taught to fight.

41:38.840 --> 41:41.593
He wanted me to have
choices in the world.

41:41.680 --> 41:44.194
And I choose
to help the poor.

41:44.280 --> 41:46.840
You are not about
to stop me doing that.

41:46.920 --> 41:49.992
But does your father know
what you're doing?

41:50.080 --> 41:52.389
He thinks I enjoy embroidery.

41:57.400 --> 42:00.790
Give me a moment?
I have a mill to open.

42:24.200 --> 42:26.156
(Sn/ﬁling)

42:33.040 --> 42:34.189
Take this.

42:36.240 --> 42:40.074
It's for you and Owen.
In memory of your son.

42:49.880 --> 42:51.632
John?

43:11.040 --> 43:15.431
I hereby declare this mill...
open for business.

43:26.600 --> 43:29.353
He has to have the glory,
doesn't he?

43:29.960 --> 43:31.598
(Much) Glory?

43:32.200 --> 43:33.633
No.

43:34.840 --> 43:37.354
I think he just wants
to be loved.

43:41.000 --> 43:43.309
Thank you, all of you.
All of you.
