There's nothing students appreciate more
on the last day of school

00:47.338 --> 00:49.299
than a nice, clean campus.

00:57.599 --> 00:59.893
Yeah! No more school!

01:03.646 --> 01:05.231
Hello, freedom.

01:15.533 --> 01:17.535
-Have a good summer, Tyler!
-See you, Tyler!

01:19.829 --> 01:20.914
Watch this.

01:21.498 --> 01:23.041
Hey, no skating on school grounds.

01:24.626 --> 01:26.836
-Whoa!

01:31.007 --> 01:33.551
-Officer Wagstaff, did you see that?
-What?

01:33.635 --> 01:36.679
-You skatin' on school grounds?
-I could have gotten hurt.

01:37.055 --> 01:39.015
Not if you wasn't skatin'
on school grounds.

02:02.705 --> 02:05.667
Oh, whoa,
this is a really nice car, Craig.

02:06.042 --> 02:08.461
Everybody loves the Miats, brahts.

02:08.545 --> 02:11.089
Yeah, the... Miats is pretty sweet.

02:11.756 --> 02:14.175
Oh, bummer about
that stain on your car seat, though.

02:14.467 --> 02:15.677
What stain?

02:18.263 --> 02:19.305
What the...

02:25.270 --> 02:29.023
Whoa! That was a lot bigger
than I thought it would be.

02:31.234 --> 02:33.528
-Well, I'm gonna go.
-You're dead!

03:02.932 --> 03:03.975
Hey!

03:12.025 --> 03:13.735
What the--

03:14.444 --> 03:15.403
Oh, hey.

03:18.698 --> 03:21.826
-What did I tell you about skatin'?
-I swear I wasn't.

03:24.704 --> 03:27.832
-That's disappointing.
-You're comin' with me.

03:35.715 --> 03:36.549
Perfect.

03:38.843 --> 03:41.012
Diane, doorbell!

03:41.095 --> 03:45.850
So thanks for watching. And don't forget
to subscribe below for more Mom Hacks!

03:45.934 --> 03:50.271
Like 20 things you can do
with expired yogurt.

03:50.855 --> 03:54.067
Ugh! Number 9 will blow your mind.

03:55.610 --> 03:56.527
Diane!

03:56.611 --> 03:58.780
-I'm making a video!

03:59.113 --> 04:00.531
Sasha, get the door!

04:03.243 --> 04:06.037
Why are you ringing the doorbell?
You live here.

04:07.163 --> 04:08.331
Afternoon, Sasha.

04:09.040 --> 04:10.041
Hey, Bernice.

04:11.084 --> 04:12.293
What'd he do this time?

04:14.629 --> 04:17.715
Come on, Mom. It's not my fault.

04:18.174 --> 04:19.926
Oh, it's never your fault.

04:20.009 --> 04:22.011
Sasha, I'm his mother.
I will handle this.

04:22.553 --> 04:24.138
Oh, it's never your fault.

04:24.681 --> 04:26.975
I'm not even angry. I'm just disappointed.

04:27.058 --> 04:27.976
Sasha, please.

04:28.726 --> 04:31.229
I'm not even angry. I'm just disappointed.

04:31.312 --> 04:34.107
-You should be angry.
-Nobody asked you, Roger.

04:34.190 --> 04:37.443
Diane, the boy is out of control.
He only thinks of himself.

04:37.527 --> 04:41.572
-Mom, Craig made me fall off my board.
-So you vandalized a police car?

04:41.656 --> 04:43.866
Tyler, someone could've gotten
hurt today.

04:43.950 --> 04:46.703
-We expect better from you.
-Sasha, stop speaking for me.

04:48.871 --> 04:50.456
We really do expect better
from you.

04:52.542 --> 04:57.213
Honey, you can't keep acting out when
someone does something you don't like.

04:57.755 --> 05:01.134
Officer Wagstaff thinks spending your
summer helping the school custodian

05:01.217 --> 05:03.136
-will teach you a lesson.
-Oh, come on.

05:03.219 --> 05:05.179
How will picking up trash
teach me anything?

05:05.263 --> 05:08.641
-I agree with Tyler.
-Again, nobody... Wait, you do?

05:08.725 --> 05:12.437
Real Estate Agent of the Year.
Little League Coach of the Year. Oh!

05:13.021 --> 05:15.648
-Dad of the Year.
- I gave him that one.

05:15.732 --> 05:18.985
What can I say? The man loves
a mountable engraved keepsake.

05:19.068 --> 05:22.822
Unless you plan on spending the rest of
your life being a professional screwup,

05:23.448 --> 05:25.199
you need to make some changes.

05:25.825 --> 05:28.411
Let me tell you about
the summer I became a man.

05:28.494 --> 05:31.998
Roger, please. I don't need to hear
about the year your hedges grew in.

05:34.208 --> 05:35.793
"Malibu Beach Junior Rescuer"?

05:36.919 --> 05:38.338
"...of the Year."

05:38.421 --> 05:43.051
This program, Tyler, taught me
courage, honor, sacrifice.

05:44.177 --> 05:48.765
-Something you know nothing about.
-Honey, where are you going with this?

05:48.848 --> 05:52.977
Diane, the boy thinks he can do
whatever he wants, whenever he wants.

05:53.061 --> 05:55.313
Trust me, Junior Rescue,

05:55.396 --> 05:57.357
it is just the thing he needs.

05:57.440 --> 06:00.735
Wait. His punishment is hanging out
at the beach all summer?

06:00.818 --> 06:03.363
-Mm-hm.
-I don't tell my mom how to punish you.

06:03.446 --> 06:06.991
Don't tell your dad how to punish me.
You're right, Roger.

06:07.075 --> 06:09.869
A summer at the beach
is exactly what I deserve.

06:30.139 --> 06:33.351
Vooch? You're driving
to the Junior Rescue program?

06:33.434 --> 06:36.396
-This just keeps getting better.
-Yeah, it does!

06:36.938 --> 06:39.857
-Why's it better?
-Because I'm spending summer in Malibu,

06:39.941 --> 06:41.818
and being driven
by my favorite driver.

06:41.901 --> 06:44.862
You mean that? I always thought
we had a connection,

06:44.946 --> 06:46.739
but I didn't know if you felt the same.

06:46.823 --> 06:49.367
-What if it was all in my head?
-Don't make it weird.

06:50.118 --> 06:51.994
Well, hop aboard the Vooch train!

07:01.379 --> 07:03.631
Wait, I'm goin' to Junior Rescue too!

07:03.714 --> 07:05.800
Wait for me!

07:13.057 --> 07:15.852
Hey, there! You goin'
to Malibu Beach Junior Rescue?

07:16.269 --> 07:19.230
No, I'm just working out at a bus stop
'cause that's a thing I do.

07:19.605 --> 07:22.525
-All right. You have a good day.
-Uh--

07:23.860 --> 07:26.237
I was being sarcastic.

07:28.698 --> 07:29.949
She's scary.

07:32.452 --> 07:34.078
-Hold up!

07:34.162 --> 07:36.080
I knew I should've set two alarms.

07:41.127 --> 07:42.170
Hey, I'm Tyler.

07:43.337 --> 07:44.213
Gina.

07:44.922 --> 07:46.340
Eating some eggs there?

07:46.424 --> 07:48.009
Good protein. Want one?

07:48.092 --> 07:49.969
Nah, I had a dozen before I left.

07:52.847 --> 07:54.140
I got you all packed up.

07:54.640 --> 07:56.684
Sunscreen. Water shoes.

07:58.269 --> 07:59.187
A life ring?

07:59.270 --> 08:01.147
If they had more of those
on the Titanic,

08:01.230 --> 08:05.401
-that movie would've ended in a wedding.
-Mom, you have to relax. I'll be fine.

08:08.905 --> 08:10.448
There's the bus. Wish me luck.

08:10.990 --> 08:13.576
No, wait. Wish me a water-based emergency.

08:13.659 --> 08:15.912
Something with sharks. See you at five!

08:17.997 --> 08:19.081
Hey!

08:21.292 --> 08:24.587
Hi! I'm Lizzie. How awesome is this?
Junior Rescue!

08:24.670 --> 08:26.506
I can't wait to get to the beach and--

08:26.589 --> 08:28.257
She's gonna chug that whole thing.

08:29.717 --> 08:31.677
Oh, my gosh. I hope she doesn't choke.

08:33.012 --> 08:36.933
But if she does, don't worry. I'm CPR
certified. I know the Heimlich maneuver.

08:37.016 --> 08:39.977
Once, I thought this guy was choking
so I gave him the Heimlich.

08:40.061 --> 08:42.897
But he was just laughing.
I broke his rib, he sued my parents.

08:45.566 --> 08:47.443
-Are you choking?

08:51.447 --> 08:52.532
Aah!

08:53.282 --> 08:55.451
Yeah, she wasn't choking.

08:57.828 --> 09:00.289
Oh, boy, they're headed up the hill!

09:00.373 --> 09:02.542
I did not have
a big enough breakfast for this.

This is my punishment?

10:28.085 --> 10:30.087
This is gonna be
the best summer ever.

10:30.171 --> 10:32.590
All right, you kids have fun. I'm gonna...

10:32.923 --> 10:34.967
Ah, you don't care what I'm gonna do.

10:35.635 --> 10:37.053
Can't wait to get in the water.

10:39.972 --> 10:42.433
We're gonna be lifeguards.
At a real beach.

10:43.017 --> 10:45.978
Did you know you're 100% more likely
to get attacked by an octopus

10:46.062 --> 10:47.605
at a beach than in a pool?

10:47.688 --> 10:48.522
That's a fact.

10:53.152 --> 10:55.488
That's gotta be... a world record.

10:55.863 --> 10:58.783
Uh-oh. I'm goin' down!

10:58.866 --> 10:59.700
I'm okay.

11:01.160 --> 11:02.328
Rode...

11:02.620 --> 11:03.454
bike...

11:03.537 --> 11:04.914
from Valley...

11:04.997 --> 11:06.707
Me.... Eric....

11:07.166 --> 11:09.585
What? That's, like, 20 miles.

11:09.877 --> 11:10.753
Man down!

11:11.545 --> 11:13.714
Eric, you have to keep your feet
elevated.

11:13.798 --> 11:15.633
Helps get the blood back to your brain.

11:15.716 --> 11:17.968
Ew! I just saw up his shorts.

11:19.261 --> 11:21.263
Come on, bro. Come on. All right.

11:21.639 --> 11:24.058
Am I dead? Is this heaven?

11:25.768 --> 11:26.602
Better.

11:27.436 --> 11:28.521
It's Malibu.

11:28.604 --> 11:31.148
- Hey, watch it!
- My bad! Sorry!

11:31.232 --> 11:33.484
Oops! Don't worry, I got it!

11:42.118 --> 11:44.704
Looks like you could use a hand.
I'm Tyler.

11:44.787 --> 11:47.206
Oh, wow, thanks, Tyler. I'm so late.

11:49.500 --> 11:51.669
Looks like you're the one who could
use a hand.

11:52.044 --> 11:53.003
That'd be great.

11:53.087 --> 11:53.921
Wouldn't it?

11:59.593 --> 12:02.179
Jeffy, you seen my great big candy bar?

12:05.391 --> 12:08.602
-Come on. What's that all over your face?
-Don't worry. I'll get that.

12:08.686 --> 12:10.563
Now you're gonna get ants in your mouth.

12:14.150 --> 12:17.903
I think we should set up over there,
because I wanna be close to the water,

12:17.987 --> 12:20.156
but not to need to move
when the tide comes in.

12:20.239 --> 12:23.033
Set up your beach chair?
What are you talking about?

12:23.117 --> 12:27.663
-We're kicking it at the beach all summer!
-Do you even know what Junior Rescue is?

12:28.330 --> 12:29.540
-I do not.

12:34.420 --> 12:37.465
What are you doin' just standin' around,
beach rats?

12:38.090 --> 12:39.675
Aah!

12:39.759 --> 12:42.094
What's up? My name's Brody.

12:42.178 --> 12:43.637
This is my bro, Spencer.

12:43.721 --> 12:46.682
And that is Spencer's bro, Logan,
who is also my bro.

12:47.600 --> 12:48.434
'Sup?

12:48.726 --> 12:52.813
And these are the rest of
the Malibu Beach Junior Rescue Captains.

12:52.897 --> 12:54.982
Over the next two weeks, it is our job

12:55.065 --> 12:58.277
to turn you steaming pile of fish turds
into Junior Rescue.

12:58.611 --> 13:01.238
I thought just by coming here
we're Junior Rescue.

13:01.322 --> 13:03.949
Oh, no. This is the training.

13:04.241 --> 13:05.993
At the end, there's this big test.

13:06.076 --> 13:08.704
We pass that,
then we're actual Junior Rescue.

13:08.788 --> 13:11.207
-Now, we're just fish turds.
-...joy of being captain.

13:11.290 --> 13:15.044
-Then what am I supposed to do with this?
-I'll show you what you can do with this.

13:30.935 --> 13:32.353
Is this a joke to you?

13:32.520 --> 13:35.022
You think this is just
some day at the beach?

13:35.981 --> 13:36.899
Isn't it?

13:39.527 --> 13:42.154
Dude, I'm just messin' around.
Hey, I'm Tyler.

13:42.738 --> 13:45.074
Hi. I'm Eric. Mitchell. Eric Mitchell.

13:45.157 --> 13:46.492
We're from the Valley.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.702
Oh, the Valley.

13:49.453 --> 13:50.871
Oh, well that explains it.

13:50.955 --> 13:52.122
Explains what?

13:52.540 --> 13:53.415
The smell.

13:53.499 --> 13:55.042
That's me!

13:55.125 --> 13:56.961
Rode my bike the whole way here.

13:57.044 --> 13:59.839
And didn't put on deodorant this morning,
'cause I was like,

13:59.922 --> 14:01.590
"We're gettin' in the water anyway!"

14:01.674 --> 14:02.842
Listen up!

14:03.300 --> 14:04.885
You're on my sand now.

14:05.594 --> 14:07.471
I'm gonna run you till you puke.

14:07.847 --> 14:09.598
I'm gonna swim you till you puke.

14:10.140 --> 14:12.059
I'm gonna teach you CPR until you--

14:12.142 --> 14:13.352
-Puke?
-No!

14:14.144 --> 14:18.065
You puke while you're giving CPR, you're
gonna seriously endanger the victim!

14:18.816 --> 14:22.194
Those of you who complete the program
and pass the Crucible

14:22.278 --> 14:26.156
will get to spend the summer working under
actual Malibu lifeguards.

14:27.032 --> 14:30.995
As Senior Captain,
it's my job to make sure you don't suck.

14:31.537 --> 14:32.621
Spencer!

14:32.705 --> 14:34.582
Get these sea slugs
out of my sight.

14:36.417 --> 14:37.543
Two mile run.

14:38.460 --> 14:39.295
Follow me.

14:42.298 --> 14:43.340
Running?

14:43.424 --> 14:45.050
I thought this was gonna be fun.

14:45.134 --> 14:46.719
Move it, Valley!

14:46.802 --> 14:47.928
Before I'm 80!

14:49.096 --> 14:51.056
Hey. Hey! I said follow me!

14:52.349 --> 14:53.350
Get back here!

14:54.184 --> 14:55.936
This is so hardcore!

16:07.925 --> 16:09.134
Ahem.

16:10.094 --> 16:10.928
Okay.

16:11.011 --> 16:15.099
The lifeguard's number one responsibility
is keeping people safe in the water.

16:16.517 --> 16:18.394
Sorry, just... one second.

16:20.396 --> 16:21.355
Ahem.

16:21.897 --> 16:23.399
And in conclusion....

16:24.024 --> 16:25.442
No, wait, that's not right.

16:25.526 --> 16:27.069
Seven, four...

16:27.152 --> 16:28.278
three...

16:28.362 --> 16:32.324
Okay. Does anyone see a card with a number
two on it? Got a little circle around it?

16:32.616 --> 16:34.952
I told Garvin she wasn't captain material.

16:35.911 --> 16:37.997
Any day now... Dylan.

16:38.580 --> 16:39.623
Right. Um.

16:39.707 --> 16:42.418
We're just gonna do
the standard Malibu swim tests.

16:42.501 --> 16:44.670
So, out to the buoy and back.
But make sure...

16:45.045 --> 16:47.047
Somebody's excited to get into the water.

16:47.131 --> 16:49.883
-'Cause you're on the swim team?
-How do you know that?

16:49.967 --> 16:51.802
'Cause your shirt says "Swim Team".

16:51.885 --> 16:52.928
Also your pants.

16:53.387 --> 16:56.515
Oh. Right. Yeah. I live for this.

16:57.307 --> 16:59.018
The tide's really strong out there,

16:59.101 --> 17:00.769
-so be--

17:02.354 --> 17:03.605
I was gonna say be careful.

17:05.149 --> 17:07.192
If anyone gets stung by a jellyfish,

17:07.317 --> 17:09.445
I call dibs on peeing on the sting!

17:29.923 --> 17:31.175
You okay?

17:31.258 --> 17:32.259
I'm fine.

17:41.894 --> 17:43.896
Gina, seriously, let me help you.

17:46.065 --> 17:47.816
I don't need your help.

17:56.700 --> 17:59.661
-Hey, how was the first day?
-Why? What'd you hear?

18:00.913 --> 18:02.164
So fun!

18:02.956 --> 18:05.375
I'm in pain. Pretty much everywhere.

18:05.959 --> 18:07.461
Are you?

18:07.544 --> 18:09.379
Whoa, whoa! Hey, might--

18:09.797 --> 18:12.299
We might wanna
leave some of that sand at the beach!

18:15.177 --> 18:16.637
I'm joking. I'm joking.

18:18.180 --> 18:19.640
I just wanna go home.

18:19.723 --> 18:21.517
All right, let's hit the road, kids.

18:38.450 --> 18:40.369
How is this year's crop?

18:40.452 --> 18:43.080
Pretty good, sir. Malibu represent!

18:43.163 --> 18:44.123
One thing, though.

18:44.706 --> 18:47.918
Did you know that
there's a group of kids here from...

18:48.293 --> 18:49.253
the Valley?

18:49.336 --> 18:50.420
Of course I know.

18:50.504 --> 18:52.840
Nothing happens on this beach
without my knowledge.

18:53.465 --> 18:54.341
Cool.

18:57.010 --> 18:58.887
So you wanna like, get some froyo or...

18:58.971 --> 19:00.472
-You should leave.
-Right.

19:12.151 --> 19:14.820
"Mom, where's the remote?"

19:15.279 --> 19:18.574
I used to get asked that question
500 times a day,

19:18.657 --> 19:21.743
till I came up with this little Mom Hack.

19:24.538 --> 19:28.167
I thought of it when I asked
to use the bathroom at a gas station!

19:28.625 --> 19:30.836
Try losin' this, you little monsters!

19:38.177 --> 19:40.304
$25 for organic tortillas?

19:40.804 --> 19:43.932
That's it, this family's switchin'
to Taco Every Other Tuesday.

19:44.725 --> 19:46.935
-Uh, you got a second?
-How was your first day?

19:47.269 --> 19:51.398
That's what I wanted to talk to you about.
I... don't... like it.

19:51.481 --> 19:54.067
And also I hate it,
so I'm just gonna quit, cool?

19:54.151 --> 19:55.360
Out of the question.

19:55.986 --> 19:58.822
But it's summer vacation and it's hard.

19:58.906 --> 20:00.741
Yes, it is. Very hard.

20:00.824 --> 20:03.702
Roger, I shouldn't even be there.
It's not fair.

20:03.785 --> 20:04.745
You know what, Tyler?

20:05.454 --> 20:06.872
Life isn't fair.

20:06.955 --> 20:09.249
All right? You can't always do
what you wanna do.

20:09.333 --> 20:12.002
Now, listen, I know I'm not your father,
but trust me.

20:12.085 --> 20:14.171
-This will be good for you.

20:20.427 --> 20:22.262
Where's that tortilla receipt?

20:24.640 --> 20:25.557
Diane!

20:28.560 --> 20:30.854
Heard my dad won't let you
quit lifeguard school.

20:31.355 --> 20:32.397
Go away, Sasha.

20:32.481 --> 20:34.858
Fine, I guess I won't tell you
how to get out of it.

20:35.901 --> 20:37.486
You know how I can get out of it?

20:37.569 --> 20:40.906
Same way I got out of ballet, even though
Dad paid for a year of lessons.

20:41.240 --> 20:44.826
You didn't get out, you got kicked out
for biting Ruby Thompson.

20:44.910 --> 20:47.746
You bit a girl just to get out of ballet!

20:47.829 --> 20:52.084
You wanna get kicked out of an omelet?
Sometimes you gotta bite a few eggs.

20:53.335 --> 20:54.419
Huh.

21:00.717 --> 21:02.928
-Day two, shark farts.

21:03.679 --> 21:05.013
Aah!

21:05.097 --> 21:08.684
Today, we are going to split you up
into your training pods.

21:09.351 --> 21:12.729
Your pod is gonna be like
your team for the rest of this program.

21:12.813 --> 21:15.274
-For me, about 15 more minutes--
-What's that, brah?

21:15.357 --> 21:18.402
Nothing' bro...dy. Brody.

21:21.029 --> 21:24.574
Look, not everybody has what it takes
to be Malibu Junior Rescue.

21:24.992 --> 21:26.285
You gotta know your stuff.

21:26.368 --> 21:30.872
Which is why I'm giving each pod an
experienced captain to be their leader.

21:30.956 --> 21:34.501
I got dibs on these guys right here.
You're my Dogfish, let me hear ya!

21:36.503 --> 21:37.504
Who's our captain?

21:38.130 --> 21:41.967
Hey, whoa, Spence. I'm puttin' you
with the Barracudas over here.

21:42.426 --> 21:44.469
Oh! Thank God.

21:45.470 --> 21:46.305
Dylan.

21:46.888 --> 21:49.433
Let's see what you can do
with Team Flounder.

21:51.101 --> 21:52.978
Flounder? Really?

21:53.603 --> 21:54.479
Let's move!

21:54.813 --> 21:55.647
Move out.

21:56.231 --> 21:57.149
Hey, guys!

21:57.232 --> 22:00.027
So, I'm Dylan.
And I'm pumped to be your captain.

22:00.485 --> 22:03.196
It's my job to... prepare you for...

22:03.780 --> 22:06.366
Prepare you for...
What am I preparing you for?

22:06.450 --> 22:08.285
Ah! Here it is. Success.

22:09.286 --> 22:12.247
Full disclosure, I've never really been
a captain before.

22:12.706 --> 22:13.540
No kidding.

22:14.082 --> 22:15.083
I'll be home by lunch.

22:15.167 --> 22:16.585
-What'd you say?
-Nothing.

22:16.668 --> 22:18.962
Why's everybody keep thinking
I'm saying something?

22:19.046 --> 22:20.839
Great to meet you, Dylan. I'm Lizzie.

22:21.006 --> 22:23.508
Don't worry,
if anyone suffers traumatic blood loss,

22:23.592 --> 22:25.677
I've got a belt I can make into a
tourniquet.

22:26.636 --> 22:27.888
Lizzie. Belt.

22:28.555 --> 22:30.640
Good to know. Why don't we get started?

22:31.016 --> 22:33.018
Sooner we start,
sooner I'll get out of here.

22:33.352 --> 22:34.227
-What?
-What?

22:34.311 --> 22:35.312
What?

22:35.395 --> 22:37.522
You gotta stop saying things
under your breath.

22:37.606 --> 22:38.732
It's super confusing.

22:39.358 --> 22:40.400
Let's train.

22:45.822 --> 22:49.034
To begin CPR, pinch the nose
and give two short breaths.

22:50.827 --> 22:52.746
Followed by 30 chest compressions.

23:06.968 --> 23:09.054
Now, how did that get in there?

23:10.013 --> 23:13.183
All right, let's break off into pairs
and practice what I showed you.

23:17.312 --> 23:18.939
Dude, what are you doing?

23:19.648 --> 23:20.899
Clearly not enough.

23:25.028 --> 23:29.241
Rescue buoys are an essential piece
of lifeguard... equipment.

23:29.950 --> 23:31.910
Really didn't need the card for that one.

23:31.993 --> 23:34.079
Okay, Flounders, any questions?

23:34.162 --> 23:36.581
Um... Can we not be the Flounders?

23:36.665 --> 23:37.999
I will ask.

23:38.458 --> 23:39.292
Nothing else?

23:39.376 --> 23:41.837
'Kay. Grab your buoys
and let's hit the water.

23:42.879 --> 23:44.589
- Well, okay.

23:45.298 --> 23:46.842
-Almost got it.
- Oh...

23:46.925 --> 23:47.968
Hey!

23:48.677 --> 23:50.637
Why are these things so slippery?

23:54.766 --> 23:55.600
Did you do this?

23:56.351 --> 23:57.519
You caught me.

23:59.646 --> 24:01.356
Are you trying to get kicked out?

24:03.400 --> 24:04.568
Thought that was obvious.

24:08.530 --> 24:10.240
What are you doing with that?

24:13.285 --> 24:15.537
Jeffy! You seen my baby oil?

24:17.622 --> 24:19.875
Not cool, Jeffy. Not cool!

24:22.836 --> 24:27.340
Pretty solid second day, especially from
my pod! Let me hear you, Dogfish!

24:29.384 --> 24:32.846
Barracuda, Hammerhead, Stingray, Sea Lion,
high-five.

24:34.055 --> 24:34.931
Flounders.

24:35.015 --> 24:36.975
I need to see
a little bit more out of you.

24:37.350 --> 24:38.727
And by a little I mean a lot.

24:39.561 --> 24:41.313
Now get off my beach.

24:43.607 --> 24:44.649
What's that?

24:55.327 --> 24:57.078
Nice knowin' you guys.

24:59.498 --> 25:01.958
Mr. Cross, I'm so sorry
for all the trouble today.

25:02.042 --> 25:03.293
No, I'm sorry, Dylan.

25:03.710 --> 25:06.213
I had my doubts putting you
in charge of that pod.

25:06.296 --> 25:09.216
You lack the confidence necessary
to be a true leader.

25:09.633 --> 25:11.718
Whoa, all right? It's not her fault.

25:11.801 --> 25:13.595
I'm the problem.
You should kick me out.

25:14.179 --> 25:17.724
-Kick you out?
-Great idea. Lot of growin' up to do.

25:17.807 --> 25:19.643
-Well, I better get goin'.
-Hey! Ah!

25:20.310 --> 25:22.437
Get back here. You're not goin' anywhere.

25:23.813 --> 25:28.735
Dylan, you really need to step up your
game if you're gonna be captain of a pod.

25:28.818 --> 25:31.321
-Understood?
-Understood. I won't let you down.

25:32.322 --> 25:34.574
Dylan, I didn't mean
to get you in trouble.

25:34.658 --> 25:35.575
Well, you did.

25:38.662 --> 25:42.249
It's not her fault. You can't be mad
at her like that. She didn't do anything.

25:43.333 --> 25:44.751
You're Roger's son.

25:46.461 --> 25:47.462
Stepson.

25:47.546 --> 25:50.465
You know, back in the day,
Roger and I were pod mates.

25:51.299 --> 25:54.219
He was even named
Junior Rescuer of the Year.

25:56.346 --> 25:59.349
Gave up the Malibu life
and moved to the Valley.

26:00.308 --> 26:02.394
We lost a good one.

26:02.978 --> 26:04.187
He's not dead.

26:04.854 --> 26:05.939
Oh, isn't he?

26:06.773 --> 26:09.150
Look, I know what you're trying
to do here, Tyler.

26:09.234 --> 26:12.529
You think if you act like an idiot,
I'll throw you out of the program.

26:12.612 --> 26:13.655
It's not gonna happen.

26:13.738 --> 26:15.991
But I'm bringing my whole pod down.

26:16.074 --> 26:16.908
Exactly.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.953
I'll let you in on a little secret.

26:20.036 --> 26:23.290
I don't want you, or any of the losers
in that pod, in my program.

26:23.623 --> 26:24.457
What?

26:24.541 --> 26:26.710
This summer,
the bleeding hearts at City Hall

26:26.793 --> 26:29.879
decided I needed
to be a little bit more inclusive.

26:29.963 --> 26:32.674
They forced me to accept candidates
from...

26:34.009 --> 26:35.677
non-beach cities.

26:35.760 --> 26:37.762
You don't want us
as we're from the Valley?

26:37.846 --> 26:39.139
That's right.

26:39.222 --> 26:43.184
For years, the Junior Rescue
only accepted Malibu's finest.

26:43.685 --> 26:46.396
Malibu locals protecting Malibu beaches.

26:46.479 --> 26:47.981
That's the way it should be.

26:48.064 --> 26:48.940
That's messed up.

26:49.024 --> 26:53.028
What's messed up is some bureaucrat
telling me how to run my beach.

26:53.528 --> 26:55.280
Tyler, I didn't know what to do.

26:55.822 --> 26:57.407
-Until your father--
-Stepfather.

26:57.490 --> 26:59.159
...asked me to straighten you out.

26:59.743 --> 27:02.746
Then I realized it was a gift
from Poseidon himself.

27:02.829 --> 27:04.873
-What?

27:05.915 --> 27:08.418
A punk like you is what I need
to show the mayor

27:08.501 --> 27:10.837
-I know what's best for my beach.
-That's not fair.

27:12.589 --> 27:13.923
Welcome to Malibu.

27:17.510 --> 27:20.305
I'm sorry you guys were punished
for something you didn't do.

27:20.764 --> 27:24.142
I heard that in the Marines,
if a recruit is acting like an idiot,

27:24.225 --> 27:27.103
the unit puts an orange in
a sock and beats him with it.

27:27.646 --> 27:31.107
I've got half a clementine
left from lunch. Would that work?

27:31.191 --> 27:32.984
You won't believe what Cross told me.

27:33.068 --> 27:34.444
Tyler, save it.

27:34.527 --> 27:36.655
-But--
-Maybe this is just a big game to you,

27:36.738 --> 27:39.115
-but I actually want to be here.
-We all do.

27:39.824 --> 27:41.326
So just stop.

27:43.953 --> 27:47.791
Oh, hey, bro, when you finish up here,
I got a bookshelf you can put together.

27:48.792 --> 27:50.877
Bookshelf! That's hilarious.

27:50.960 --> 27:52.962
I know, right? I don't even read!

27:58.885 --> 28:02.430
Why don't we take a quick break and
we'll do some endurance training?

28:02.514 --> 28:04.057
I'll go get my notecards.

28:08.978 --> 28:10.313
I think someone's in trouble.

28:11.481 --> 28:14.526
-Tyler, enough.
-Seriously. What's your deal?

28:14.609 --> 28:15.568
No, really, look!

28:18.947 --> 28:20.532
-I'll go get help.
-Oh...

28:20.615 --> 28:22.242
We <i>are</i> the help.

28:22.325 --> 28:23.243
Yeah, we are.

28:29.791 --> 28:30.625
Thank you.

28:30.709 --> 28:34.045
Are you kidding? I've been waiting
for someone's life to be in danger!

28:34.129 --> 28:35.463
I thought it'd never happen.

28:35.547 --> 28:36.715
-Lizzie!
-Right, right.

28:46.433 --> 28:47.267
What's wrong?

28:50.395 --> 28:51.896
I-- I'm gonna go get help.

28:52.397 --> 28:54.524
But... That was <i>my</i> idea.

28:55.066 --> 28:57.277
Keep going, come on! Almost there!

28:57.360 --> 29:00.113
-We got you!
-Get him on. Okay, paddle, we gotta go.

29:03.491 --> 29:04.743
- Come on!
-Go.

29:05.410 --> 29:07.454
We got you, buddy, let's go. Hang on.

29:07.537 --> 29:09.831
Come on, guys. You got him. You got him.

29:20.091 --> 29:21.176
Starting compressions.

29:21.843 --> 29:23.511
Live, man! Live!

29:23.595 --> 29:25.305
Stay away from the light!

29:25.388 --> 29:27.182
The light is not your friend!

29:27.807 --> 29:30.018
Nobody panic, I got my CPR cards
right here.

29:30.101 --> 29:31.686
-Come on.
-What's goin' on?

29:31.770 --> 29:33.646
Our pod pulled this dude
out of the water.

29:33.897 --> 29:36.566
-Come on.
-Is... that a CPR dummy?

29:36.649 --> 29:38.067
Come back to me.

29:38.151 --> 29:39.235
Oh, no.

29:40.695 --> 29:43.740
-Sorry. This dummy never had a chance.
- Look at this!

29:43.823 --> 29:46.701
Control your pod. Looks like
you don't know what you're doing.

29:50.663 --> 29:51.498
Dylan, I...

29:51.581 --> 29:54.250
I thought it was a real person. I'm sorry.

29:54.334 --> 29:55.835
Maybe everybody's right.

29:56.920 --> 29:58.755
Maybe I wasn't ready for this.

30:01.841 --> 30:05.053
I don't get it. How'd a CPR dummy
get out in the ocean?

30:05.637 --> 30:09.265
Jeffy! Quit messin' with that dummy!
Quit it!

30:09.349 --> 30:11.267
-I see you, Jeffy!
-Don't run away from me!

30:11.351 --> 30:13.895
You know I can't run in sand! Jeffy,
get back here!

30:15.855 --> 30:17.023
Hey!

30:19.150 --> 30:20.193
Save any lives today?

30:20.276 --> 30:21.361
Real funny, Vooch.

30:22.320 --> 30:24.614
-What'd I say?
-We don't wanna talk about it.

30:25.406 --> 30:26.574
Just take us home, man.

30:27.909 --> 30:28.785
All right.

30:54.769 --> 30:56.271
Yeah, that's what I thought.

30:56.771 --> 30:59.274
-What?
-Its broken. But relax.

30:59.357 --> 31:01.317
I can fix it. Just give me 20 minutes.

31:03.444 --> 31:04.362
30 minutes.

31:14.455 --> 31:17.292
-How's it goin', Vooch?

31:19.085 --> 31:21.337
Ah, 20... 30 minutes, tops.

31:23.673 --> 31:25.550
He's been saying that for an hour.

31:25.633 --> 31:27.343
I could call my mom to pick us up.

31:28.344 --> 31:31.931
But I'd have to tell her the bus broke
down. She'd never let me ride it again.

31:32.348 --> 31:34.017
She's a worrier.

31:34.100 --> 31:36.436
I'm glad I'm sitting here right now.

31:36.519 --> 31:38.646
I'm not ready
to tell my parents about today.

31:38.730 --> 31:41.941
It was kind of exciting, though.
We saved a guy today.

31:42.901 --> 31:45.528
Okay, not a guy, but a very expensive
piece of equipment.

31:46.195 --> 31:50.491
-I really thought someone was drowning.
-Hey, we all did. It's not your fault.

31:50.575 --> 31:52.619
I know it's not. It's <i>your</i> fault.

31:53.244 --> 31:55.413
Because of you,
everybody thinks we're a joke.

31:55.496 --> 31:56.497
No, they don't.

31:56.581 --> 31:58.249
Oh, no, they do. Trust me.

31:58.333 --> 32:01.419
I know the difference
between when people are laughing with me,

32:01.502 --> 32:03.171
and people are laughing at me.

32:03.254 --> 32:05.006
And today it was the latter.

32:05.673 --> 32:06.925
What's your deal, anyway?

32:07.300 --> 32:08.384
I was just...

32:08.468 --> 32:10.136
trying to get myself kicked out.

32:10.219 --> 32:11.346
Seriously?

32:12.055 --> 32:15.308
I've been begging my parents for years
to let me come here.

32:15.391 --> 32:17.769
But my mom was like,
"Lizzie, what if you get hurt?

32:18.186 --> 32:21.522
Lizzie, what if you drown?
Lizzie, what if..."

32:22.649 --> 32:25.318
Actually, it was just those two things
she's worried about.

32:25.401 --> 32:29.280
I was just trying to get my stepdad
off my back. He thinks I'm a screwup.

32:29.364 --> 32:31.240
Why are you taking that out on us?

32:31.324 --> 32:33.701
I'm not, I wasn't even thinking
about you guys.

32:33.785 --> 32:34.786
Tyler!

32:35.495 --> 32:36.454
Ouch!

32:36.955 --> 32:38.748
I didn't mean it like that.

32:39.248 --> 32:42.335
You know, if you put
half as much effort into this program

32:42.418 --> 32:45.672
as you did trying to get out of it,
you might actually be good at it.

32:46.506 --> 32:48.800
I don't care
if you're good at it or not.

32:48.883 --> 32:51.469
I didn't sign up for Junior Rescue
to spend the summer

32:51.552 --> 32:53.304
rebuilding lifeguard chairs.

32:53.388 --> 32:55.890
I wanna start next season in peak
condition.

32:55.974 --> 32:57.308
I came here to swim.

32:57.934 --> 32:59.560
I came here to make friends.

32:59.644 --> 33:02.355
Also 'cause my dad says the couch
is getting a dent in it

33:02.438 --> 33:03.856
that looks like my butt.

33:07.652 --> 33:08.695
Guys.

33:09.570 --> 33:10.405
I'm sorry.

33:11.531 --> 33:13.574
It's cool. We're cool.

33:14.075 --> 33:15.118
We're all cool.

33:16.661 --> 33:17.662
Right?

33:20.123 --> 33:21.541
Yeah, we're cool.

33:23.042 --> 33:25.670
This is so beautiful, you guys.

33:26.212 --> 33:29.924
Moments like this are the reason
I became a school bus driver.

33:30.341 --> 33:32.719
Vooch, please tell me the bus is fixed.

33:33.011 --> 33:35.972
Oh, yeah, she's been ready
for, like, 20, 30 minutes.

33:41.227 --> 33:45.440
And that's how you use hot glue
to upcycle used underpants

33:45.523 --> 33:47.400
into a cute purse.

33:49.027 --> 33:52.196
Now, I took these boxers
out of my husband's undies drawer,

33:52.280 --> 33:55.158
-but I made sure they were clean...
-Get yourself kicked out?

33:55.241 --> 33:57.410
No. They won't.
And your dad won't let me quit.

33:57.910 --> 34:02.081
-I can drop a cinder block on your knee.
-Or I could just do the program.

34:02.165 --> 34:04.709
If you wanna make the wussbag
move, that's on you.

34:04.792 --> 34:06.335
One second... Okay...

34:06.794 --> 34:08.504
And... we're done!

34:09.088 --> 34:10.339
Well, just...

34:10.882 --> 34:15.553
be sure to close up the pee-pee hole
or you'll lose all your change!

34:16.137 --> 34:17.346
So cute.

34:18.806 --> 34:20.808
- Hey, watch it!
- My bad!

34:23.519 --> 34:24.353
Thanks.

34:24.437 --> 34:27.315
No problem. Don't wanna
waste time picking up trash.

34:27.398 --> 34:32.445
Gotta make up for yesterday. Only a week
before that big lifeguardy testy thingy.

34:32.528 --> 34:33.863
That's unexpected.

34:33.946 --> 34:35.990
Appreciated, just unexpected.

34:36.449 --> 34:39.410
Um, what do you say
we start with a three-mile run?

34:39.494 --> 34:41.579
-Three-mile run?
- Tyler!

34:42.121 --> 34:43.664
Three miles! Let's do it!

34:44.332 --> 34:45.166
All right!

34:45.249 --> 34:46.250
Let's do it!

34:47.627 --> 34:48.503
Jeffy!

34:49.712 --> 34:50.713
Jeffy!

34:50.797 --> 34:51.964

35:53.734 --> 35:55.194
I propose a toast.

35:55.695 --> 35:58.990
I'm really proud of you guys.
We're really coming together as a team.

35:59.073 --> 36:00.700
We had a rocky first few days,

36:00.783 --> 36:03.161
but I think you're ready
for the Crucible on Friday.

36:03.244 --> 36:05.538
-What's the Crucible?
-Are you serious?

36:05.621 --> 36:09.667
It's the test we're training for, the
one we need to pass to be Junior Rescue?

36:09.750 --> 36:13.171
Plus, the winning pod gets to work
Tower One for the rest of the summer.

36:13.254 --> 36:15.131
It's the best tower on the beach.

36:15.548 --> 36:17.758
Prime location,
in the middle of everything.

36:17.842 --> 36:20.887
It's even got a stereo
and a private bathroom.

36:20.970 --> 36:23.514
And there's this monster riptide
right in front of it,

36:23.598 --> 36:26.309
so people almost die there,
like, every day.

36:26.392 --> 36:27.351
How great is that?

36:27.810 --> 36:29.770
How could you not know any of this?

36:29.854 --> 36:32.607
You said you fall asleep
with your manual on your chest!

36:32.982 --> 36:35.568
Not reading it.
I like the weight, it's comforting.

36:41.449 --> 36:43.701
-Get off my table, fish turd!
-Oh!

36:47.496 --> 36:49.290
Somebody's gotta shut Brody up.

36:49.373 --> 36:50.208
Let it go.

36:50.666 --> 36:53.711
The only way to shut a guy like that up
is to beat him.

36:54.295 --> 36:55.296
Like in the Crucible?

36:56.047 --> 36:57.798
Yeah. That's what I meant.

36:58.758 --> 37:00.927
Definitely didn't mean with a bat.

37:01.010 --> 37:02.803
Okay, don't get crazy.

37:03.304 --> 37:04.847
Brody's Dogfish win every year.

37:04.931 --> 37:05.932
Not this year.

37:06.307 --> 37:09.060
All right, this year,
Tower One belongs to the Flounders.

37:11.854 --> 37:13.981
What are you laughing at? I'm serious.

37:14.065 --> 37:17.360
I don't know if you noticed,
but we're not exactly Malibu's finest.

37:17.443 --> 37:19.403
-Let's focus on passing the Crucible.
-Yeah.

37:19.487 --> 37:21.364
We're as good as anybody from Malibu.

37:21.447 --> 37:24.116
Gina's on the swim team,
Lizzie's obsessed with first aid.

37:24.659 --> 37:26.702
Eric's... really supportive.

37:26.786 --> 37:29.080
Just want you to know,
I believe in you guys.

37:29.747 --> 37:30.748
Aww!

37:30.831 --> 37:32.124
We can win this.

37:32.208 --> 37:35.836
We have to, even if it's just
to shove it in Brody's face.

37:35.920 --> 37:37.171
Who's with me?

37:37.255 --> 37:38.089
I'm with you.

37:38.673 --> 37:40.841
What the heck. Let's win this thing.

37:41.425 --> 37:42.969
Let's take Tower One!

37:43.552 --> 37:45.513
We look like huge dorks right now.

37:45.596 --> 37:47.306
If I said yell "Flounders" on three?

37:47.390 --> 37:49.392
-I'm out.
-Yeah, hard pass.

37:56.482 --> 37:59.944
I'm telling you, Mr. Cross, the Flounders
are looking pretty good out there.

38:00.027 --> 38:05.908
It's almost like they've united against a
common enemy, but I don't know who.

38:09.829 --> 38:12.498
What? You think they have a shot
at winning the Crucible?

38:12.915 --> 38:14.917
Oh! No way, bro.

38:16.168 --> 38:18.421
Sir. Bro... Sir.

38:18.504 --> 38:22.550
No, my Dogfish got the Crucible
on lock, so you can count on that.

38:25.011 --> 38:28.556
I got the mayor comin'
to watch the competition this year.

38:28.639 --> 38:31.267
I'm afraid I need
more than your word this time.

38:34.353 --> 38:36.105
Great day today, you guys.

38:36.188 --> 38:38.566
Get a good night's sleep,
and I'll see you tomorrow.

38:40.651 --> 38:42.653
- Watch it!
- Ow, my knee!

38:42.737 --> 38:44.905
- Sorry!
- Tyler!

38:46.115 --> 38:48.951
-Got a minute? I wanna talk to you.
-Uh... Okay.

38:49.410 --> 38:53.247
I've been thinkin' about our little talk.
I want you to know I've reconsidered.

38:54.123 --> 38:57.460
So, if you want to leave the program,
I'd be happy to tell your father--

38:57.543 --> 38:58.544
Stepfather.

38:59.086 --> 39:02.089
That you've completed it
to our satisfaction. How does that sound?

39:05.092 --> 39:07.720
-And I didn't even know!

39:09.096 --> 39:11.390
No, thanks. I'll stick it out.

39:13.351 --> 39:14.518
Oh, yeah!

39:15.186 --> 39:16.937
Right on the bus, baby.

39:17.021 --> 39:19.648
Everybody seat belt up.
They should all be working now.

39:32.203 --> 39:34.455
The Crucible is made up of five
competitions.

39:35.039 --> 39:37.124
<i>A beach to buoy Zodiac race,</i>

39:37.208 --> 39:39.168
<i>followed by an open water rescue,</i>

39:39.710 --> 39:41.045
<i>a half-mile swim to shore,</i>

39:41.128 --> 39:45.633
<i>a backward carry  round the first-aid</i>
<i>station, ending in an ATV race.</i>

39:45.716 --> 39:49.595
So today, we'll practice operating
an official Malibu Rescue four-wheeler.

39:49.678 --> 39:54.892
This baby has a 250 CC air-cooled engine,
double wishbone suspension,

39:54.975 --> 39:56.685
and an automatic transmission.

39:56.769 --> 39:59.730
-There's nothing it can't handle.
-See you later, suckers.

40:00.272 --> 40:01.899
Not without the key, smart guy.

40:04.276 --> 40:05.611
Gina, you're up first.

40:08.614 --> 40:11.242
Guys, quick.
There's an emergency in the parking lot.

40:11.325 --> 40:14.995
Somebody left an American Girl doll
locked in a hot car with the windows up.

40:17.915 --> 40:19.542
Yo, what's your problem, man?

40:20.042 --> 40:21.877
You're my problem, man.

40:21.961 --> 40:24.588
You're a screwup.
You don't have what it takes.

40:24.672 --> 40:26.882
-I'm not a screwup.
-Then prove it.

40:27.550 --> 40:30.719
If you can beat me to the end of the beach
on that ATV,

40:31.387 --> 40:33.389
I'll leave you alone
the rest of the program.

40:34.515 --> 40:36.183
Brody, we don't have time for this.

40:36.642 --> 40:37.726
She's right.

40:37.810 --> 40:39.103
The Crucible's tomorrow.

40:39.687 --> 40:40.771
Just let it go, Tyler.

40:43.482 --> 40:44.442
Tyler...

40:53.784 --> 40:55.202
This isn't gonna end well.

41:39.288 --> 41:41.123
- Watch out!
- Stop! Stop!

41:43.042 --> 41:44.668
Guess you win, bro!

41:44.752 --> 41:45.836
-Hah!
- Look out!

41:50.674 --> 41:52.051
-Oh!
-Eek!

41:59.975 --> 42:01.227
Officer Wagstaff?

42:04.271 --> 42:06.232
So, uh... you havin' a nice summer?

42:06.857 --> 42:09.193
Let's go. You wanted to get kicked out?

42:09.693 --> 42:12.279
-You got it. You're done.
-But that's not what I want.

42:12.363 --> 42:15.199
Should've thought of that
before you took that little joy ride.

42:15.282 --> 42:17.660
Be lucky if the sand sculptors
don't press charges.

42:18.410 --> 42:19.620
What about my pod?

42:24.124 --> 42:26.085
Flounders are gonna go up in flames.

42:26.168 --> 42:28.337
And the mayor's gonna be here to see
it happen!

42:29.755 --> 42:32.550
Thanks, Tyler. I knew I can count on you.

42:32.633 --> 42:33.884
What's this? Oink!

42:38.305 --> 42:41.559
Man, I thought you were actually takin'
this seriously.

42:43.936 --> 42:44.937
I was.

42:55.406 --> 42:57.783
Lights out soon.
You have an early morning.

42:57.866 --> 42:58.742
I know, Mom.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.286
Hey.

43:00.995 --> 43:03.914
Don't get mad at me.
You brought this on yourself.

43:05.624 --> 43:07.167
I know. I screwed up.

43:08.627 --> 43:12.047
Bet Roger's loving that I'm spending
summer helping the school custodian.

43:12.423 --> 43:13.799
Of course he's not.

43:14.717 --> 43:15.718
Honey.

43:16.885 --> 43:18.887
I know you and Roger don't see
eye to eye.

43:19.597 --> 43:22.057
Eye to eye? Mom, he thinks I'm a screwup.

43:22.141 --> 43:25.060
Because you've been acting like one
ever since we got married.

43:27.730 --> 43:29.857
He really thought this
would be good for you.

43:29.940 --> 43:31.150
Maybe it was.

43:31.609 --> 43:32.484
A little.

43:32.901 --> 43:35.821
Oh, honey, I know it's not easy for you.

43:36.614 --> 43:38.616
New stepdad. New stepsister.

43:39.116 --> 43:40.492
New baby on the way.

43:40.826 --> 43:44.830
But just give Roger a chance, okay?
He might surprise you.

44:07.811 --> 44:11.607
Whoa, you caught that wrapper
first snatch!

44:11.690 --> 44:14.193
Took me two years to master that.

44:14.777 --> 44:16.820
School's out.
Where did this trash come from?

44:17.071 --> 44:18.364
Oh, I put it out.

44:18.447 --> 44:20.157
Don't want you to get bored.

44:23.118 --> 44:24.161
I can't believe this.

44:24.244 --> 44:26.413
We actually had a shot
at winning the Crucible.

44:26.497 --> 44:29.333
And now we're paying
for Tyler's screwup. Again.

44:29.667 --> 44:32.419
-Let me hear you, Dogfish!

44:33.587 --> 44:37.007
I really wanted to see the look on
Brody's face when we took Tower One.

44:37.925 --> 44:41.679
I'll catch up with you guys in a minute.
Actually, like, 15 minutes, I gotta...

44:42.930 --> 44:45.265
That's Eric business,
you don't need to know.

44:50.020 --> 44:52.606
- You are a genius.

44:52.690 --> 44:55.234
I can't believe
you got Tyler to lose it.

44:55.317 --> 44:57.111
Oh, please. It was so easy.

44:57.695 --> 45:00.698
Garvin was worried that the Valley kids
were gettin' too good.

45:00.781 --> 45:03.701
So he's like "Bro-dog.
You're my number one brahs.

45:03.784 --> 45:06.036
You gotta help me get Tyler outta here.

45:06.120 --> 45:08.455
His biggest weakness
is that he's a total hothead."

45:08.539 --> 45:11.291
And I was like,
"Well, his <i>biggest </i>weakness

45:11.375 --> 45:13.210
is he's got no definition
in his arms."

45:13.293 --> 45:15.629
That's not true! Tyler has great arms!

45:15.713 --> 45:18.424
So then he was like,
"Bro, just push until he snaps.

45:18.507 --> 45:20.551
Give me a reason to kick him outta here."

45:20.634 --> 45:25.681
And I was like, "Dude, it's already done."
Except it wasn't, so I went and did it.

45:25.764 --> 45:27.766
-Epic!
-I know, right?

45:34.273 --> 45:39.194
Guys, guys, guys, guys! You'll never
believe what I just heard in the bathroom!

45:46.744 --> 45:48.537
Great work today, Tyler.

45:48.620 --> 45:52.082
You have a real future
in the custodial arts. You know....

45:52.916 --> 45:54.918
you remind me of a young me.

45:56.170 --> 45:57.588
Please stop talking.

46:05.012 --> 46:07.222
-What are you doing here?
-You were set up!

46:07.306 --> 46:09.558
Brody knew he was leading you
to the sculptures.

46:09.641 --> 46:12.019
-He wanted you kicked out.
-It was Garvin's idea.

46:12.102 --> 46:14.605
It's like Garvin wants us to fail
or something.

46:15.105 --> 46:17.691
-He does.
-What are you talking about?

46:18.192 --> 46:21.320
The mayor made Garvin take
kids from the Valley into the program.

46:21.445 --> 46:24.656
Garvin wants us to look bad so he
never has to take Valley kids again.

46:27.910 --> 46:28.744
Wow.

46:29.286 --> 46:30.162
That's...

46:30.537 --> 46:31.497
That's messed up.

46:32.039 --> 46:33.624
Why didn't you say somethin'?

46:33.916 --> 46:35.167
I was going to!

46:35.250 --> 46:37.503
But then we started doing so well,

46:37.586 --> 46:39.505
and Garvin's plan wasn't gonna work
anyway.

46:39.838 --> 46:41.590
Until I screwed it all up.

46:44.134 --> 46:45.511
I'm so sorry, guys.

46:46.053 --> 46:48.806
Oh, my God.
That's why he made me your captain.

46:48.889 --> 46:51.433
He knew I would do a bad job
because it's my first time.

46:51.517 --> 46:54.603
-Also because you're a hot mess.
-No, I don't think that's it.

46:55.020 --> 46:56.522
-Maybe?
-No...

46:56.605 --> 46:59.483
-We can't let him get away with this.
-We gotta do something.

46:59.858 --> 47:04.321
You got booted out for crashing the
Santa Monica Sand Sculpture Competition.

47:04.655 --> 47:08.325
Yes, Vooch. That's why. I don't know
why you feel the need to rub it in.

47:08.617 --> 47:09.827
Santa Monica.

47:10.285 --> 47:11.995
-Yes.
-Santa Monica.

47:12.287 --> 47:13.247
Yes.

47:13.330 --> 47:15.666
Santa... Mo-nee-ca...

47:15.749 --> 47:18.085
Yes, Vooch! We established that,
what's your point?

47:18.168 --> 47:22.381
Garvin's in charge of Malibu Beach.
Santa Monica's outside his jurisdiction.

47:25.425 --> 47:27.678
I think Vooch found a loophole.

47:28.303 --> 47:29.721
Well, I am a lawyer.

47:30.180 --> 47:32.599
Not in this country,
but, you know, same diff.

47:34.142 --> 47:35.143
Will that work?

47:35.727 --> 47:37.521
I guess we're gonna find out.

48:18.437 --> 48:20.105
Welcome to the Crucible!

48:22.482 --> 48:26.904
This is the final competition in the
Malibu Beach Junior Rescue program.

48:28.030 --> 48:30.532
Today we find out which of you
are the best...

48:30.908 --> 48:32.951
which of you are the best of the best...

48:33.035 --> 48:34.244
-Right here.

48:34.745 --> 48:36.496
And which of you are the worst.

48:38.832 --> 48:42.210
Where are those Valley rats?
Mayor's gonna be here any minute.

48:42.294 --> 48:45.464
I need him to see what a mistake
it was forcing me to take them.

48:45.547 --> 48:46.632
I haven't seen them.

48:53.430 --> 48:55.057
I'm very proud to announce

48:55.140 --> 48:58.060
we've got a distinguished guest
visiting us this year.

48:58.143 --> 49:01.229
-The Mayor of Los Angeles!

49:04.816 --> 49:07.069
Mr. Mayor! Welcome to Malibu.

49:07.527 --> 49:10.530
Think you'll enjoy watching
Malibu's finest do what they do best.

49:10.948 --> 49:16.203
It's not just Malibu. Our beautiful
beaches are the pride of all Angelenos.

49:18.747 --> 49:22.542
-My goodness. Who is that?
-Those are our friends from the Valley.

49:23.335 --> 49:26.380
Part of the Malibu Beach Junior
Rescue Program, thanks to you.

49:26.463 --> 49:27.464
Oh, the mayor!

49:27.965 --> 49:29.800
Cool.

49:30.509 --> 49:33.011
Well, I suppose we should get started.

49:33.095 --> 49:34.221
What are you doin' here?

49:34.304 --> 49:37.182
Just meetin' the mayor, sir.
It's a pleasure to meet you.

49:37.265 --> 49:38.141
'Scuse me.

49:39.059 --> 49:40.936
You're not part of this program anymore.

49:41.019 --> 49:43.814
You kicked me out for something
that happened in Santa Monica.

49:43.897 --> 49:46.149
You got no juice there.
I'm competing with my pod.

49:46.233 --> 49:48.986
-There's nothing you can do.
-That's ridiculous.

49:49.069 --> 49:51.113
This is my program.
I can do whatever I want.

49:51.488 --> 49:52.572
Do we have a problem?

49:55.659 --> 49:56.910
I don't know. Do we?

49:57.452 --> 49:58.286
No.

49:59.579 --> 50:01.581
No problem whatsoever, sir.

50:01.665 --> 50:03.250
So, shall we start the Crucible?

50:03.959 --> 50:05.168
Let's.

50:08.672 --> 50:12.092
<i>Junior Rescue Crucible.</i>

50:12.592 --> 50:15.220
<i>Captains, get your pods</i>
<i>to the starting area.</i>

50:16.304 --> 50:17.264
Okay, guys!

50:17.639 --> 50:18.557
We got this.

50:18.640 --> 50:21.309
Lemme just find my cards.
I know they're in here.

50:21.393 --> 50:23.812
<i>One minute.</i>
<i>This is your one-minute warning.</i>

50:24.855 --> 50:27.899
I can't find my cards.
I must've forgotten to pack them!

50:28.275 --> 50:30.277
-Dylan, forget the cards.
-I need the cards.

50:30.694 --> 50:33.447
-I never coached a team to the Crucible.
-Dylan.

50:33.989 --> 50:35.115
Dylan!

50:35.490 --> 50:38.410
You turned us from the worst pod
into one so good,

50:38.493 --> 50:40.454
they needed to cheat to keep us out.

50:41.038 --> 50:42.706
You don't need cards, you never did.

50:43.540 --> 50:46.209
You got this.
Just tell us what we need to do.

50:50.839 --> 50:54.676
Okay. First up is the Zodiac race.
Eric, remember to feather your paddle.

50:54.968 --> 50:57.179
Gina, stay in time with everyone.
Work as a team.

50:58.221 --> 50:59.181
Everybody, hands in.

51:00.432 --> 51:02.017
One, two, three...

51:02.100 --> 51:03.268
Go, Flounders!

51:04.644 --> 51:06.354
I told you we were gonna be friends.

51:06.438 --> 51:08.273
-Let's kick Brody's butt.
-Let's do it!

51:08.356 --> 51:09.649
Let's murder him!

51:10.692 --> 51:14.488
In the race. Murder him in the race
with how fast we are.

51:14.571 --> 51:17.616
<i>-All pods to the starting line.</i>
-Oh, look, the Crucible's starting!

51:29.002 --> 51:31.421
On your mark... get set...

51:37.427 --> 51:38.678
<i>And they're off!</i>

51:46.770 --> 51:48.438
-Ready? Come on.
-Yes, go.

51:52.317 --> 51:57.030
<i>The Flounders are first into the water,</i>
<i>but the Dogfish are close behind.</i>

52:05.747 --> 52:06.957
Paddle, Flounders!

52:07.040 --> 52:08.792
You guys can do it! Paddle! Paddle!

52:10.127 --> 52:14.256
Come on, Dogfish! Pick it up!
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!

52:14.339 --> 52:15.966
-Paddle!

52:16.424 --> 52:18.468
Pull! Pull!

52:19.052 --> 52:22.639
-Yes! Yes! Come on! Come on!
-Guys, faster! Let's go!

52:22.722 --> 52:24.474
Once again, come on, let's go!

52:24.558 --> 52:26.101
Pull! Pull!

52:27.352 --> 52:28.478
Oh, yeah.

52:31.398 --> 52:33.191
Okay, steady, steady!

52:33.275 --> 52:36.194
<i>The Dogfish are first to the buoy</i>
<i>and the next challenge,</i>

52:36.278 --> 52:37.904
<i>the underwater rescue.</i>

52:40.574 --> 52:42.492
Okay, Eric, you're up. Come on.

52:43.785 --> 52:44.619
You got it.

52:49.249 --> 52:52.836
<i>One member of each pod must retrieve</i>
<i>a sandbag from the ocean floor.</i>

52:52.919 --> 52:54.671
<i>First to find it is...</i>

52:54.754 --> 52:55.839
<i>the Dogfish!</i>

52:55.922 --> 52:58.300
Oh, and the Dogfish get the bag.

52:58.425 --> 53:00.218
Guess that means we're in the lead.

53:01.094 --> 53:04.514
<i>The Dogfish are killin' it.</i>
<i>They're on the open water swim.</i>

53:04.598 --> 53:06.975
-You think he found the sandbag?
-I hope he's okay.

53:08.560 --> 53:09.477
Come on, Eric.

53:09.936 --> 53:10.770
He got it!

53:10.854 --> 53:12.856
-Yes, Eric! Come on.
-I got it.

53:12.939 --> 53:14.941
Hurry up. Let's go!

53:17.736 --> 53:20.614
-Yes, Eric! Whoo!
-We got it!

53:21.114 --> 53:23.033
Eric, yes, you did it!

53:23.116 --> 53:25.076
Might be a little too late.

53:25.160 --> 53:26.870
<i>The Flounders are in second place.</i>

53:26.953 --> 53:28.788
<i>But if they're gonna catch  the Dogfish,</i>

53:28.872 --> 53:30.707
<i>they'd better get a swimmer</i>
<i>in the water.</i>

53:30.790 --> 53:33.126
Time to out-swim
these suckers, Flounder style.

53:34.920 --> 53:36.296
Phew.

53:37.297 --> 53:38.840
-You okay?
-What's wrong?

53:38.924 --> 53:40.175
I can't do it.

53:40.258 --> 53:43.220
Yes, you can. You're a star swimmer,
swimming's your life.

53:43.803 --> 53:46.181
-I'm not even on the team.
-What?

53:46.723 --> 53:48.725
I mean, I was in junior high, but...

53:48.808 --> 53:51.937
when I got to high school, everybody
was just bigger and better.

53:52.354 --> 53:53.939
Uh... I don't know.

53:54.022 --> 53:57.734
I was just like, "What if I'm the worst?"
and... I just choked.

53:57.817 --> 54:00.111
What are they waiting for?
Come on. Come on!

54:00.820 --> 54:03.031
What if I get in the water and I screw up?

54:03.114 --> 54:05.450
-You can't be the team screwup.
-Why not?

54:05.951 --> 54:07.410
Because that's my job.

54:08.370 --> 54:09.204
Okay.

54:09.788 --> 54:11.831
-How far behind am I?
-45 seconds.

54:16.920 --> 54:17.921
Meet me on the beach.

54:18.546 --> 54:20.131
- Go!
- Go, go, go!

54:20.632 --> 54:22.676
Come on. You heard her, let's go!

54:25.637 --> 54:27.514
<i>The Flounders are back in the race.</i>

54:27.597 --> 54:30.433
Whoo! Go, Flounders!

54:31.059 --> 54:32.352
She's fast, right?

54:37.232 --> 54:40.360
Come on, Dogfish! Move faster,
what are you doing?

54:44.447 --> 54:48.827
<i>This is amazing! What an incredible</i>
<i>display of speed and determination!</i>

54:54.082 --> 54:56.710
<i>I can't believe it!</i>
<i>The Flounders are back in the lead!</i>

54:56.793 --> 54:58.712
See you at the rescue station.

54:59.337 --> 55:02.048
Come on, Dogfish, move it!

55:04.718 --> 55:06.261
-Yes.
- Gina.

55:07.137 --> 55:09.347
You did it! You beat all of them!

55:09.431 --> 55:11.349
Tell me... something...

55:11.433 --> 55:13.518
-I don't know.
-First aid challenge is mine.

55:13.601 --> 55:15.937
Move your butts, people!
We're moving her on three.

55:16.021 --> 55:17.397
-One, two, three!
-Okay.

55:17.939 --> 55:19.691
You better not drop me!

55:21.735 --> 55:23.445
-You're good, you're good
-Go!

55:23.528 --> 55:24.487
All right, come on!!

55:24.571 --> 55:27.866
<i>Now each pod must transport one member</i>
<i>quickly and safely</i>

55:27.949 --> 55:29.701
<i>-to the first aid station.</i>
-Go, go, go!

55:29.784 --> 55:31.578
Dogfish are falling behind.

55:31.661 --> 55:33.872
Gosh, I hope you don't lose Tower One.

55:34.205 --> 55:35.832
Wanna borrow my notecards?

55:39.919 --> 55:41.504
I don't understand.

55:41.588 --> 55:43.340
First Tyler wants to quit the program.

55:43.423 --> 55:45.592
Then he wants to stay,
then he gets kicked out,

55:45.675 --> 55:47.969
only to leave us a note
saying he's going back.

55:48.053 --> 55:50.388
I actually think
he's getting more irresponsible.

55:50.472 --> 55:52.390
He's got a lot of explaining to do.

55:52.474 --> 55:55.852
Sasha, please.
Though I would like some answers.

55:56.478 --> 56:00.357
<i>The finish line is all that stands</i>
<i>in the way of the Flounders and victory!</i>

56:00.440 --> 56:01.316
Come on, hurry up!

56:01.399 --> 56:03.109
Gentle! Come on!

56:03.193 --> 56:04.069
Okay...

56:06.488 --> 56:07.322
We're winning!

56:07.405 --> 56:09.157
You got this, Tyler. It's all you!

56:09.240 --> 56:11.659
As long as he doesn't
crash into any sand sculptures.

56:11.743 --> 56:14.204
-Eric.
-Because it would slow him down!

56:14.287 --> 56:16.748
-That's all I'm sayin'!
-Tyler! The key!

56:18.875 --> 56:20.502
-Come on!
-Come on!

56:22.754 --> 56:23.630
Go, Tyler!

56:26.091 --> 56:27.342
<i>And the Flounders are off!</i>

56:28.343 --> 56:31.596
Come on! Let's win Tower One!
Go! Go! Go! Go! Go!

56:44.609 --> 56:47.278
-Stop!
-Lady, what is wrong with you?

56:47.362 --> 56:49.864
It's Jeffy! He was playing around
in one of your boats,

56:49.948 --> 56:53.159
and I just turned away for, like,
two seconds, but just look!

56:53.243 --> 56:55.745
-I'm in a boat!
-Please, you have to do something!

56:56.788 --> 56:59.082
-Hi!
-Jeffy.

57:05.588 --> 57:08.591
<i>Teams Sea Lion and Barracuda</i>
<i>aren't giving up.</i>

57:09.509 --> 57:11.719
-What are you doing?
-Tyler, we have this.

57:11.803 --> 57:12.720
Jeffy needs help.

57:16.266 --> 57:17.225
But Brody will win.

57:17.308 --> 57:19.978
If we don't finish the race,
we won't be Junior Rescue.

57:20.061 --> 57:24.691
Forget Brody. If we don't save Jeffy,
we don't deserve to be Junior Rescue.

57:26.860 --> 57:27.694
Let's go.

57:33.366 --> 57:35.076
Oh, no.

57:35.618 --> 57:39.330
Mom, I broke it! Please! Help!

57:39.414 --> 57:41.040
He's headed right for the jetty!

57:42.667 --> 57:44.961
-I'm going after him.
-Eric, Gina, go with Tyler.

57:45.044 --> 57:46.713
Try to nudge the boat back to shore.

57:51.468 --> 57:53.803
Grab a first-aid kit
and meet me at the beach.

58:05.773 --> 58:08.359
<i>The Dogfish head for the finish.</i>
<i>Where are the Flounders?</i>

58:08.443 --> 58:09.402
The Dogfish will win.

58:18.703 --> 58:19.913
We're almost to him.

58:19.996 --> 58:22.540
I'm gonna get alongside,
try to bump him back to shore.

58:23.333 --> 58:24.417
Jeffy!

58:24.501 --> 58:26.753
Jeffy, I need you to kill the engine.

58:26.836 --> 58:28.338
Help me!

58:28.421 --> 58:30.548
I don't think he's listening.

58:31.799 --> 58:34.219
Gina, here, take the wheel.
Get me up next to him.

58:40.725 --> 58:42.101
Almost there, keep it up.

58:43.019 --> 58:44.103
Aah!

58:45.563 --> 58:46.439
You okay, buddy?

58:53.404 --> 58:54.280
Oh, no.

58:54.948 --> 58:55.907
They're gonna crash.

58:55.990 --> 58:57.325
Hang on, Jeffy!

59:09.212 --> 59:10.338
I lost him.

59:10.421 --> 59:11.548
I can find him.

59:13.383 --> 59:14.592
Gina, help him.

59:18.263 --> 59:21.266
<i>Nothing stands between Team Dogfish</i>
<i>and victory.</i>

59:21.349 --> 59:23.434
Where's Tyler?
I thought he was in the lead?

59:24.227 --> 59:25.186
Guys, look!

59:37.949 --> 59:39.033
Come on, buddy.

59:40.618 --> 59:41.869
Let's go, Gina!

59:55.300 --> 59:58.136
Starting compressions.
One, two, three, four...

1:00:00.096 --> 1:00:01.264
Nothing!

1:00:02.140 --> 1:00:05.143
One, two, three, four, five.

1:00:06.436 --> 1:00:07.312
Nothing.

1:00:07.395 --> 1:00:10.064
One, two, three, four, five.

1:00:12.191 --> 1:00:13.026
Nothing.

1:00:13.359 --> 1:00:14.527
- Yes, Jeffy.
-Yes!

1:00:14.611 --> 1:00:16.154
-He's breathing!
-He's breathing!

1:00:16.904 --> 1:00:19.115
-We did it!
- Nice job, Lizzie.

1:00:19.198 --> 1:00:21.743
-It's okay.
- My sweet baby boy, my angel.

1:00:21.826 --> 1:00:22.702
Jeffy! Oh!

1:00:23.578 --> 1:00:24.621
Thank you!

1:00:24.704 --> 1:00:26.539
Oh, thank you. My perfect angel.

1:00:27.290 --> 1:00:28.791
Oh, I love you so much.

1:00:28.875 --> 1:00:30.877
Jeffy, my beautiful boy.

1:00:31.461 --> 1:00:33.296
And he's a butt-face again.

1:00:33.838 --> 1:00:35.214
That kid's a menace.

1:00:35.965 --> 1:00:38.468
I'm so glad I told my mom
the Crucible was tomorrow.

1:00:38.551 --> 1:00:40.553
If she saw that dangerous thing
we just did,

1:00:40.637 --> 1:00:42.513
she'd lock me in my room
for the summer.

1:00:42.597 --> 1:00:43.598
Tyler!

1:00:44.057 --> 1:00:45.016
Honey!

1:00:45.099 --> 1:00:46.225
Oh! That was...

1:00:46.934 --> 1:00:48.227
Well, that was...

1:00:48.311 --> 1:00:49.604
Incredible.

1:00:50.063 --> 1:00:51.022
Exactly.

1:00:51.105 --> 1:00:53.983
Tyler. You sacrificed winning
to help that kid.

1:00:54.067 --> 1:00:55.360
You know what that means?

1:00:55.735 --> 1:00:58.071
-That you were wrong about me?
- No.

1:00:58.154 --> 1:01:02.283
That I was right about this program.
It's exactly what you needed.

1:01:03.534 --> 1:01:05.536
Thanks, Rog, that means a lot.

1:01:07.580 --> 1:01:09.624
Yes! Yes, come on!

1:01:09.707 --> 1:01:11.000
Come on, come on!

1:01:11.084 --> 1:01:13.795
<i>And there you have it! For the tenth</i>
<i>year in a row,</i>

1:01:13.878 --> 1:01:15.922
<i>the Dogfish have won the Crucible!</i>

1:01:20.009 --> 1:01:21.761
Dogfish do it again, baby!

1:01:22.220 --> 1:01:23.805
The Crucible's over.

1:01:24.389 --> 1:01:27.934
We didn't even finish it.
So much for making Junior Rescue.

1:01:31.521 --> 1:01:32.605
The Dogfish won!

1:01:35.441 --> 1:01:38.486
-Are you barking?
-You're darn right I am.

1:01:38.569 --> 1:01:39.779
Watch out.

1:01:39.946 --> 1:01:42.448
-Yes!

1:01:42.532 --> 1:01:43.950
Excuse me. Excuse me.

1:01:44.033 --> 1:01:47.245
Yeah!  Right on, Brody, right on.

1:01:47.328 --> 1:01:51.165
I'm very proud to announce that
once again, Brody and his pod

1:01:51.249 --> 1:01:54.168
will be defending the Malibu beaches
from Tower One this summer.

1:01:54.252 --> 1:01:56.629
-Number one, baby!
-Yeah!

1:01:57.296 --> 1:01:58.881
Oh, well, well, well.

1:01:59.340 --> 1:02:00.633
If it isn't the Flounders.

1:02:01.384 --> 1:02:03.386
Mr. Mayor,
I think it's safe to say by now

1:02:03.469 --> 1:02:07.056
that your little experiment this summer
was a complete and total failure.

1:02:07.140 --> 1:02:10.351
-They didn't even finish.
-Mr. Cross, there was a good reason.

1:02:10.435 --> 1:02:12.770
Yeah. The reason is because they stink.

1:02:13.896 --> 1:02:14.939
Brody.

1:02:15.481 --> 1:02:16.566
Uh-oh.

1:02:23.030 --> 1:02:24.198
Congratulations.

1:02:25.324 --> 1:02:26.784
- Oh, yeah!

1:02:26.868 --> 1:02:28.703
No, congratulations to you.

1:02:29.162 --> 1:02:30.455
For being a loser.

1:02:30.538 --> 1:02:32.373
-Oh-ho-ho!
-Oh!

1:02:32.999 --> 1:02:36.294
-You showed a lot of restraint there.
-I put a crab in his shorts.

1:02:36.961 --> 1:02:38.337
Ow! Ow!

1:02:38.421 --> 1:02:39.839
Something's pinching me.

1:02:39.922 --> 1:02:42.800
Ow! Get it off! Get it off!
Right here, it's moving around.

1:02:43.134 --> 1:02:45.720
Ow. Ow! Okay. Okay, okay, we got it.

1:02:45.845 --> 1:02:47.054
I think we got it. Oh!

1:02:49.932 --> 1:02:50.850
Got it.

1:02:53.269 --> 1:02:54.103
Let's go.

1:02:54.812 --> 1:02:55.980
Hello, Garvin.

1:02:57.023 --> 1:02:59.150
Roger. So good to see you.

1:02:59.609 --> 1:03:02.862
Hey, I'm sorry I couldn't straighten out
your trouble-making stepson.

1:03:03.196 --> 1:03:04.197
Son.

1:03:04.280 --> 1:03:05.281
He's my son, Garvin.

1:03:05.948 --> 1:03:07.241
He's not a troublemaker.

1:03:08.075 --> 1:03:09.160
He's a hero.

1:03:09.577 --> 1:03:12.038
He and his friends
didn't finish your  little race

1:03:12.121 --> 1:03:13.998
because they were
too busy saving a life.

1:03:14.081 --> 1:03:15.249
Is that true?

1:03:15.333 --> 1:03:17.585
It sure is. They saved Jeffy.

1:03:18.169 --> 1:03:20.171
Jeffy? Angela?

1:03:20.880 --> 1:03:23.424
Hello, Clark. I have had a day.

1:03:24.383 --> 1:03:25.218
You know them?

1:03:26.511 --> 1:03:27.678
Jeffy's...

1:03:28.429 --> 1:03:29.472
our son.

1:03:30.139 --> 1:03:31.974
Jeffy, get your finger out of your nose.

1:03:32.850 --> 1:03:35.144
Sweet! We saved the mayor's son!

1:03:35.520 --> 1:03:36.354
Crap.

1:03:38.314 --> 1:03:40.608
Malibu's lucky to have heroes like you.

1:03:42.276 --> 1:03:46.280
Garvin. What tower are you giving
to these fine young people?

1:03:47.156 --> 1:03:49.534
No tower. They didn't finish the Crucible.

1:03:49.617 --> 1:03:52.411
They're not Malibu Beach Junior Rescue,
those are the rules.

1:03:52.829 --> 1:03:55.540
They rescued a junior at Malibu Beach.

1:03:56.040 --> 1:03:57.500
Pretty much checks all my boxes.

1:03:57.583 --> 1:03:58.459
Yeah! Yeah!

1:03:58.543 --> 1:04:02.129
If they don't deserve a tower,
I don't know who does.

1:04:06.425 --> 1:04:09.637
Okay. They can have Tower 19,
by the dumpster.

1:04:14.100 --> 1:04:15.017
Ha-hem.

1:04:17.645 --> 1:04:19.313
Have a heart. Come on.

1:04:20.231 --> 1:04:23.025
Tower Two. They can have Tower Two.

1:04:24.151 --> 1:04:25.236
Tower Two!

1:04:25.820 --> 1:04:27.446
-But that's my tower.
-Beat it.

1:04:27.822 --> 1:04:28.698
Okay.

1:04:30.992 --> 1:04:32.118
So proud of you.

1:04:38.165 --> 1:04:39.542
I got my eye on you.

1:04:40.126 --> 1:04:41.627
One slipup...

1:04:41.711 --> 1:04:42.837
you're gone.

1:04:43.671 --> 1:04:45.590
You won't make it through
the summer.

1:04:47.842 --> 1:04:49.343
-Guys, we did it!

1:04:49.677 --> 1:04:51.304
-Tower Two!
-We did it!

1:04:51.387 --> 1:04:52.805
-Nice!
-Whoo!

1:04:52.889 --> 1:04:54.473
Under the rules!

1:04:58.519 --> 1:05:00.479
This is so cool.

1:05:00.938 --> 1:05:02.106
So beautiful.

1:05:02.481 --> 1:05:04.066
I can't believe it's ours.

1:05:04.650 --> 1:05:07.361
Not bad for a bunch of fish turds
from the Valley.

1:05:07.445 --> 1:05:08.905
This summer's gonna be awesome.

1:05:11.490 --> 1:05:13.242
Guys, guys, guys!

1:05:14.243 --> 1:05:18.039
Don't freak out too loud, I'm supposed
to tell you tomorrow, but I couldn't wait.

1:05:18.122 --> 1:05:19.290
Guess what's in this bag!

1:05:19.373 --> 1:05:20.333
Our uniforms?

1:05:20.416 --> 1:05:22.501
It's your uniforms!

1:05:27.173 --> 1:05:28.591
Nice!
