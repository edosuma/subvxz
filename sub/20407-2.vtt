Show me what you have got.

07:54.440 --> 07:56.974
Embarrassing.

07:57.042 --> 07:59.343
Okay, let's start
with the ladies.

07:59.411 --> 08:00.912
(Announcer)
The women are hoping

08:00.979 --> 08:02.380
that executive
sous Chef Melissa

08:02.448 --> 08:04.716
and executive Chef Gail
can get them off

08:04.783 --> 08:06.350
to a solid start.

08:06.418 --> 08:07.351
One, two, three, four.

08:07.419 --> 08:08.953
Where's the?

08:12.257 --> 08:15.727
I don't know where
the fifth piece went, Chef.

08:17.696 --> 08:19.530
Did you bite that?
<i>(Gail)</i>
<i>No, Chef.</i>

08:19.598 --> 08:20.698
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Out.</i>

08:20.766 --> 08:22.066
Out.
You'd think I'd be able

08:22.134 --> 08:23.468
to know how to make Sushi.

08:23.535 --> 08:24.502
<i>Out.</i>
But I can't.

08:24.570 --> 08:25.903
I'm not Japanese.

08:25.971 --> 08:28.005
Who sliced that?

08:28.073 --> 08:30.374
I did, Chef.
<i>Out.</i>

08:30.442 --> 08:31.609
<i>Oh, my God.</i>

08:31.677 --> 08:32.943

08:33.010 --> 08:36.013
A grand total of zero.

08:36.081 --> 08:37.615
Let's go.

08:37.683 --> 08:39.350
(Announcer)
With Melissa and Gail

08:39.418 --> 08:41.052

for their team...

08:41.120 --> 08:42.520
Thank you.

08:42.587 --> 08:44.889
Well, at least you can count
to five.

08:44.957 --> 08:49.527
(Announcer)
The pressure now shifts
to sous Chefs Nona and Jillian.

08:49.595 --> 08:50.962
It's cut beautifully.

08:51.029 --> 08:52.230
Thank you, Chef.
<i>Yeah, it's in.</i>

08:52.297 --> 08:53.331

With Jillian and Nona

09:09.581 --> 09:11.616
getting a near-perfect score,

09:11.683 --> 09:13.618
it's up to senior
home executive Chef Emily

09:13.685 --> 09:16.988
and prina
to keep the momentum going.

09:17.055 --> 09:18.089

Beautifully done.

In spite of a horrible start

the women manage to get
15 points.

Beautiful.
In.

09:59.898 --> 10:01.799
Inside, I was doing
a little happy dance.

10:01.867 --> 10:02.800
Oh, dear.

10:02.868 --> 10:04.769
No wasabi.

10:04.837 --> 10:06.671
<i>Out.</i>
<i>Out.</i>

10:06.738 --> 10:09.941
Rob, it should have immediately
already been in your head

10:10.008 --> 10:11.375
to put wasabi on the tuna.

10:11.443 --> 10:13.044
Those are the little blunders

10:13.111 --> 10:14.679
that are gonna [Bleep] Us
down the road.

10:14.746 --> 10:16.247
It's too thick
on one side.

10:16.315 --> 10:17.281
<i>Out.</i>

10:18.650 --> 10:20.251
Not good enough.

(Announcer)
With a mediocre start

10:23.088 --> 10:24.388
of four acceptable Sushi,

10:24.456 --> 10:26.490
it's time to see
if sous Chef Russell

10:26.558 --> 10:28.593
and personal Chef Raj...

10:28.660 --> 10:30.595
Come on.
You're like a walking corpse.

10:30.662 --> 10:32.530
Move.

10:32.598 --> 10:34.065
(Announcer)
Can get things moving
in the right direction.

10:34.132 --> 10:34.966
What's that?

10:35.033 --> 10:35.967
I've got a mush.

10:36.034 --> 10:37.401
Where's the salmon?

10:37.469 --> 10:38.402
It all got pushed
to the middle.

Me, Chef.
Raj, Chef.

10:52.784 --> 10:54.151
I know it's Raj.

10:56.388 --> 10:57.722
Nice.

10:57.789 --> 11:00.892
First tuna in.

11:07.833 --> 11:09.867
Yes.

11:09.935 --> 11:12.403
No.
(Boris)
You left out the wasabi.

It's molded beautifully.

12:02.487 --> 12:03.454
<i>Has it got wasabi</i>

The attention-to-detail
Sushi challenge

12:20.519 --> 12:22.086
One piece of nigiri tuna left.

(Announcer)
And it all comes down

12:23.789 --> 12:25.356
to Boris and vinny's
last piece of Sushi.

12:25.424 --> 12:30.061

You'll be joining me at
the very exclusive cellar 360,

<i>where we'll be doing</i>
<i>the most amazing wine tasting.</i>

12:47.112 --> 12:50.048
However, a slight issue,

12:50.115 --> 12:51.716
because it's not
in Los Angeles.

12:51.784 --> 12:53.685
It's in San Francisco.

12:53.752 --> 12:57.422
Oh, [Bleep]!
[exclamations]

12:57.489 --> 12:58.990
Hot damn.

12:59.058 --> 13:01.659
I've been to Daytona,
Talladega,

13:01.727 --> 13:02.961
but San Francisco?

13:03.028 --> 13:04.529
Hell, no.

13:19.712 --> 13:23.014
Not doing a punishment,
enjoying Chef Ramsay's company,

13:23.082 --> 13:24.515
it's gonna be a good day.
Yes!

13:24.583 --> 13:26.417
Let's roll, boys.

13:28.554 --> 13:30.121
(Gail)
I'm ashamed of myself.

13:30.189 --> 13:31.756
I should have been
paying attention.

13:31.824 --> 13:33.424
I should have not let
my knife get to me.

13:33.492 --> 13:35.126
I'm so sorry, guys.

13:35.194 --> 13:37.161

a long day.

13:42.701 --> 13:44.102
So let's get started.

13:44.169 --> 13:45.603
(Sabrina)
I would definitely blame Gail

13:45.671 --> 13:47.405
and Melissa
for our loss today.

13:47.473 --> 13:50.308
All they had to do
was make two pieces.

13:50.376 --> 13:52.110
Did the guys leave already?
Who cares?

13:52.177 --> 13:53.644
See y'all later.

13:53.712 --> 13:54.912
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>Bye, girls.</i>

Be careful.

13:58.317 --> 14:00.084
[Cheers]

14:00.152 --> 14:02.820

While the women begin
their punishing task...

14:02.888 --> 14:04.856
(Man)
San Fran is thataway.

14:04.923 --> 14:06.624
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay wants the men

14:06.692 --> 14:08.026

14:08.093 --> 14:09.761
Excellent. Thank you.
Take care.

14:09.828 --> 14:11.796

But he does have one rule.

14:11.864 --> 14:14.465
(Gordon)
I am not sitting next to Raj.
[laughter]

14:14.533 --> 14:18.469
One minute, you're in
the kitchen with Chef Morimoto,

14:18.537 --> 14:20.171
a dream in its own self,
and then,

14:20.239 --> 14:22.240
an hour later,
you're in San Francisco.

14:22.307 --> 14:25.143
This country boy
is on cloud nine.

14:27.413 --> 14:29.514
Excellent. Right.
Welcome to cellar 360, yeah?

14:29.581 --> 14:31.015
Don't run.
You'll have a heart attack.

14:31.083 --> 14:32.316
(Boris)
I love wine,

14:32.384 --> 14:34.152
and I love wine tasting.

14:34.219 --> 14:37.121
Welcome to cellar 360, guys,
beautiful San Francisco.

14:37.189 --> 14:39.257
What are we gonna start off
with first?

14:39.324 --> 14:40.925
Well, first one
we're gonna have

14:40.993 --> 14:42.527
is the rosemount estate
pinot grigio.

14:42.594 --> 14:43.961
<i>Taste that.</i>
<i>Look at the flavors.</i>

14:44.029 --> 14:45.763
Like with food,
you got to know your wines,

14:45.831 --> 14:48.466
because one of you will be
our rosemount estate ambassador.

14:48.534 --> 14:49.534
<i>Try these raisins</i>

14:49.601 --> 14:51.235
<i>and then try the white wine.</i>

14:51.303 --> 14:53.004
Look how they react
on your palate.

14:53.072 --> 14:54.672
I mean,
it's a wine tasting,

14:54.740 --> 14:57.775
and this is really for education
of the palate,

14:57.843 --> 15:00.344
but for me,
it was like, "oh, my God,

15:00.412 --> 15:03.181
I need a glass of wine."
Ha!

15:03.248 --> 15:06.551
I try to really only drink
once a week.

15:06.618 --> 15:08.486
Raj, you're supposed
to sip it, not gulp it.

15:08.554 --> 15:10.254
But, you know, ietty heavil.

15:10.322 --> 15:11.556
[Slurps]

15:11.623 --> 15:13.157
Right, guys.
You enjoy that?

15:13.225 --> 15:14.692
(All)
Yes, Chef. Thank you, Chef.

15:14.760 --> 15:16.360
Okay, I'm gonna get back
to Hell's Kitchen.

15:16.428 --> 15:17.161

for the girls.

15:56.468 --> 15:58.469
Come on.

15:58.537 --> 15:59.971
Come on!
Run.

16:00.038 --> 16:01.706
It's, like, not even that far
or that hard.

16:01.773 --> 16:03.875
Come on.

16:03.942 --> 16:05.176
Look,
I'll do all of it,

16:05.244 --> 16:07.378
and you can just continue

16:07.446 --> 16:09.013
to play with the soy beans--
I don't know.

16:09.081 --> 16:10.348
Oh, here we go.

16:10.415 --> 16:12.150
Just do it.

16:12.217 --> 16:13.317
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>Come on.</i>
<i>Hurry up, guys.</i>

16:13.385 --> 16:14.018
<i>Okay, ready?</i>

16:14.086 --> 16:15.887
Let's cook.

16:15.954 --> 16:17.688
(Announcer)
While the punishment divides
the red team,

16:17.756 --> 16:19.624
the reward unifies
the blue team.

16:19.691 --> 16:22.026
(Trev)
I know I'm sitting here
because of everybody else

16:22.094 --> 16:23.427
sitting at this table
right now.

16:23.495 --> 16:24.495
From me and Trev
to y'all,

16:24.563 --> 16:26.230
honestly, we appreciate

16:26.298 --> 16:29.600
y'all pulling
our dead weight.

16:29.668 --> 16:30.801
A little bit of bonding
to get us

16:30.869 --> 16:32.069
pumped up again
so we can go in and win.

16:32.137 --> 16:33.671
Hold on.
Let me call the girls up.

16:33.739 --> 16:34.639
[Laughter]

16:34.706 --> 16:36.874
I hear them prepping.

16:40.946 --> 16:43.281
Chef Ramsay
has provided delicacies

16:43.348 --> 16:44.715
from around the world.

16:44.783 --> 16:46.584
He would like you
to try all of them.

16:46.652 --> 16:48.786
One, two...

16:48.854 --> 16:50.555
Oh, my God.

16:50.622 --> 16:51.722
(Woman)
God, really?

16:51.790 --> 16:53.724
<i>Oh, no.</i>
[sighs]

16:53.792 --> 16:56.727
Shall we?
Whoa.

16:56.795 --> 16:59.497
How can you eat something
that smells that bad?

16:59.565 --> 17:00.798
<i>(Gail)</i>
<i>I think it's good.</i>
<i>I'm filipino.</i>

17:00.866 --> 17:01.999
We eat everything.

17:02.067 --> 17:04.068
This is [Bleep] Disgusting.

17:04.136 --> 17:05.469
In my country,
we eat some of this [Bleep],

17:05.537 --> 17:06.904
and we [Bleep] Like it.

17:06.972 --> 17:08.873
It's disgusting,
seriously.

17:08.941 --> 17:10.308
I'm a little insulted.

17:10.375 --> 17:11.209
(Sabrina)
I don't really care.

17:11.276 --> 17:12.410
That's disgusting.

17:12.477 --> 17:14.212
If you're gonna
defend that,

17:14.279 --> 17:15.512
well, what's your defense
on the challenge today?

17:15.580 --> 17:17.114
So it's your turn.

17:17.182 --> 17:19.116
<i>Bend her arm</i>
<i>and put it in her mouth.</i>

17:22.119 --> 17:23.354
[Gags]

17:23.422 --> 17:25.323
You all right over there?
[gags]

17:27.893 --> 17:30.361
[Sabrina vomits]
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>Oh, down she goes.</i>

17:32.252 --> 17:33.586
(Announcer)
The red team is two for two

17:33.653 --> 17:34.887
in losing challenges.

17:34.955 --> 17:36.956
And while Gail
is taking the punishment

17:37.023 --> 17:38.457
in stride...

17:38.525 --> 17:39.859
In my country,
we eat some of this [Bleep],

17:39.926 --> 17:41.127
and we [Bleep] Like it.

17:41.194 --> 17:42.728
(Announcer)
Sabrina is finding it

17:42.796 --> 17:44.063
hard to swallow.

17:44.131 --> 17:47.433
[Vomits]
Whoa.

17:47.501 --> 17:48.701
Down she goes.

17:48.769 --> 17:50.269
Sabrina puked...

17:50.337 --> 17:52.104
[Vomits]

17:52.172 --> 17:53.272
And puked.

17:53.340 --> 17:54.673
Ooh,
there she goes again.

17:54.741 --> 17:56.208
[Spits]
It's the punishment.

17:56.276 --> 17:58.444
Take it
like an adult.

17:58.512 --> 17:59.378
You all right
over there?

17:59.446 --> 18:01.180
[Vomits]

18:01.248 --> 18:03.015
All right, guys.

18:03.083 --> 18:04.216
Go up to the dorms.

18:04.284 --> 18:05.818
<i>Get a good night's sleep,</i>

18:05.886 --> 18:07.586
<i>'cause tomorrow's</i>
<i>gonna be a big day.</i>

18:07.654 --> 18:09.321
I think we're over
Sabrina's pity party.

18:09.389 --> 18:11.357
Her attitude stinks.

18:11.425 --> 18:12.858
And I'm sick of it.
We don't need that.

18:12.926 --> 18:14.293
Good night.

18:14.361 --> 18:15.461
(Announcer)
While the red team ends the day

18:15.529 --> 18:16.595
feeling quite low,

18:16.663 --> 18:18.164
the blue team returns...

18:18.231 --> 18:19.632
Ow!
That was the best!

18:19.699 --> 18:20.966
(Announcer)
Flying high.

18:21.034 --> 18:22.001
Wah!

18:22.068 --> 18:24.270
Very nice.

18:24.337 --> 18:25.538
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>Nighty-night.</i>

18:28.675 --> 18:31.444
(Announcer)
It's a new day
in Hell's Kitchen.

18:31.511 --> 18:32.945
This is it, guys.

18:33.013 --> 18:34.213
I want to bust
this [Bleep] Out today.

18:34.281 --> 18:35.714
Beat their ass.

18:35.782 --> 18:37.316
(Announcer)
And while everyone has a lot

18:37.384 --> 18:38.617
to prove
in tonight's dinner service...

18:38.685 --> 18:40.219
Hot pot coming down.
Great.

18:40.287 --> 18:41.720
(Announcer)
There's one Chef...

18:41.788 --> 18:42.788
You got
to do this faster, bro.

18:42.856 --> 18:43.889
Who needs a big improvement

18:43.957 --> 18:45.691
more than anyone else.

18:45.759 --> 18:48.127
Dude, you can't put
the yellow leaves in.

18:48.195 --> 18:49.695
<i>Every station needs this.</i>

18:49.763 --> 18:51.797
You cannot give us
[Bleep] Yellow parsley.

18:51.865 --> 18:53.966
I just have
zero expectations of Raj.

18:54.034 --> 18:56.802
He has no clue
what's going on.

18:56.870 --> 18:58.504
You're not even cutting.

18:58.572 --> 18:59.371
You're just patting it down
and bruising it.

19:01.808 --> 19:05.211
I'm really psyched
to, like, shine tonight.

19:07.547 --> 19:09.782
Okay.
Tonight is a fresh start.

19:09.850 --> 19:11.584
<i>Opening service</i>
<i>of Hell's Kitchen,</i>

19:11.651 --> 19:15.054
you made our new maitre d's life
a total misery.

19:15.121 --> 19:16.956
Chef, I've got tables
walking out.

19:17.023 --> 19:18.724
<i>They've been here</i>
<i>for two hours, Chef.</i>

19:18.792 --> 19:21.093
So one of you
from each team

19:21.161 --> 19:22.461
will become
an assistant maitre d'.

19:24.664 --> 19:27.933
Ladies, Jillian.

19:28.001 --> 19:29.301
<i>Gentlemen...</i>

19:29.369 --> 19:30.436
Vinny,
it's gonna be you.

19:30.504 --> 19:32.671
Oh, fantastic.

19:32.739 --> 19:34.507
I'm gonna do my best
for my guys in the kitchen

19:34.574 --> 19:36.141
and do whatever
I possibly can.

19:36.209 --> 19:38.077
Turn on the charm
a little bit.

19:38.144 --> 19:39.211
Get on your stations.

19:41.114 --> 19:42.648
James, open Hell's Kitchen,
please.

19:42.716 --> 19:43.983

<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

<i>First couples</i>
<i>arriving, yes?</i>

20:00.166 --> 20:01.700
(Announcer)
For tonight's dinner service,

20:01.768 --> 20:02.868
Jillian and vinny
will be helping James

20:02.936 --> 20:05.304
as assistant maitre d's.

20:05.372 --> 20:07.506
We have a phenomenal
rosemount pinot noir.

20:07.574 --> 20:09.475
(Announcer)
In addition
to his regular menu...

20:09.543 --> 20:12.111
We are having
a Sushi special tonight.

20:12.178 --> 20:15.915
(Announcer)
Chef Ramsay has added
a salmon roll appetizer.

20:15.982 --> 20:18.350
Guys, we're open.
Let's get this done.

20:18.418 --> 20:20.719
(Announcer)
Hoping to get her kitchen off
to a good start,

20:20.787 --> 20:22.821
Jillian delivers
her first ticket quickly.

20:22.889 --> 20:24.557
[Bleep].
Jillian.

20:24.624 --> 20:26.659
It says at a table of two,
they've got three desserts.

20:26.726 --> 20:28.427
Oh, I'm sorry.
I meant to write one.

20:28.495 --> 20:30.162
Why are your hands shaking
so badly?

20:30.230 --> 20:31.497
I'm scar--
I'm nervous.

20:31.565 --> 20:32.798
What's the matter--
yeah, but...

20:32.866 --> 20:34.166
Tonight is not
about being nervous.

20:34.234 --> 20:36.201
Holy crap. How am I supposed
to not be nervous

20:36.269 --> 20:37.703
when I got to go out
in the dining room

20:37.771 --> 20:39.371
and try to be a maitre d',

20:39.439 --> 20:40.839
something
I've never done before?

20:40.907 --> 20:42.074
You're
a big girl now, yes?

20:42.142 --> 20:43.342
Yes, Chef.
Let's go.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.844
Bloody hell.

20:45.912 --> 20:47.846
<i>Okay, ladies.</i>
<i>On order, yes?</i>

20:47.914 --> 20:49.682
<i>(All)</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
One special Sushi,

20:49.749 --> 20:50.950
<i>one Risotto,</i>
<i>one salad, one scallop.</i>

20:52.586 --> 20:54.386
(Announcer)
While the red team is off
and running...

20:54.454 --> 20:55.688
Starting my Risotto,
guys.

20:55.755 --> 20:57.389
(Announcer)
The blue team is just...

20:57.457 --> 20:59.758
James, I don't know
what vinny's doing,

20:59.826 --> 21:01.160
<i>but I need some tickets</i>
<i>in here, yes?</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

21:01.227 --> 21:02.227
(Announcer)
Waiting.

21:02.295 --> 21:03.462
Yo, is that table 20?

21:03.530 --> 21:04.530
No, table 20
is right there.

21:04.598 --> 21:05.898
The first one?

21:05.966 --> 21:07.933
I've got no tickets here, yes?
Yes, Chef.

21:08.001 --> 21:10.069
<i>Let's go.</i>
I know I screwed this all up.

21:10.136 --> 21:12.404
But I'm telling you,
I'm gonna get the order right.

21:12.472 --> 21:14.740
Entrees?
[sneezes]

21:14.808 --> 21:16.408
(Announcer)
Unfortunately for the blue team,

21:16.476 --> 21:18.110
it takes vinny
over 30 minutes

21:18.178 --> 21:20.746
to deliver
his first ticket.

21:20.814 --> 21:22.915
Vinny, are you trying
to sabotage your own team?
No, not at all.

21:22.983 --> 21:23.782
Now understand
what you're doing.

21:23.850 --> 21:24.783
Own up to it.

21:24.851 --> 21:26.418
Yes, Chef.

21:26.486 --> 21:28.721
On order,
4 cups on 23, yes.

21:28.788 --> 21:30.289
Two Risotto,
two scallop,

21:30.357 --> 21:31.290
entree--
one chicken, three rib eye.

21:31.358 --> 21:33.692
(All)
Yes, Chef.

21:33.760 --> 21:35.160
(Gordon)
You come here.

21:35.228 --> 21:37.630
You're standing here
next to me,

21:37.697 --> 21:39.965
I called it out, and you just
turned your fat ass around.

21:40.033 --> 21:41.900
You didn't even
acknowledge me.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.370
I'm here. Yes, Chef.
What do you need?

21:44.437 --> 21:45.971
I'm here.
What do I need?

21:46.039 --> 21:47.306
What did I just call out?

21:50.944 --> 21:52.478
What did
I just call out, Raj?

21:52.545 --> 21:53.846
<i>I'm talking to you.</i>

21:53.913 --> 21:55.914
[Exhales deeply]

21:55.982 --> 21:58.250
(Louis)
The fact that Raj is 49

21:58.318 --> 22:00.386
and still alive

22:00.453 --> 22:02.354
and not in jail
or an asylum

22:02.422 --> 22:04.089
is a [Bleep] Miracle.

22:04.157 --> 22:06.492
What did I just call out?

22:06.559 --> 22:09.628
I didn't catch it.

22:11.031 --> 22:12.965
Oh, [Bleep] Me.
Useless.

22:13.033 --> 22:15.334
(Annjust over half anr
into dinner service,

22:15.402 --> 22:17.069
Raj hasn't even begun cooking,

22:17.137 --> 22:19.738
but has already disappointed
Chef Ramsay.

22:19.806 --> 22:22.207
Meanwhile,
in the red kitchen,

22:22.275 --> 22:24.176
Gail is doing her best
to get Chef Ramsay's

22:24.244 --> 22:25.577
stamp of approval.

22:25.645 --> 22:26.979
We still good
on that Risotto?

22:27.047 --> 22:27.813
I'm fine.
I'm fine.

22:27.881 --> 22:28.914
I have to battle back

22:28.982 --> 22:29.982
from yesterday's challenge.

22:30.050 --> 22:31.116
I have to stay focused

22:31.184 --> 22:32.718
and prove it to Ramsay,

22:32.786 --> 22:34.319
prove it to everyone,
that I can cook.

22:34.387 --> 22:35.954
I'm ready
when you're ready.

22:36.022 --> 22:37.656
I'm ready.
I'm walking up.

22:37.724 --> 22:39.324
I heard.

22:39.392 --> 22:41.960
Definitely concerned
about apps tonight, you know,

22:42.028 --> 22:44.563
because if Gail
[Bleep] That up,

22:44.631 --> 22:46.298
then we're screwed.

22:48.668 --> 22:51.336
Who made that Risotto?

22:51.404 --> 22:52.671
I did, Chef.
<i>Very nice.</i>

22:52.739 --> 22:54.373
Perfect.
Thank you, Chef.

22:54.441 --> 22:55.974
Chef Ramsay liked my Risotto!

22:56.042 --> 22:57.776

With Gail on appetizers

22:57.844 --> 23:00.145
and Sabrina on Sushi...

23:00.213 --> 23:01.680
Walking up special Sushi.

23:01.748 --> 23:03.382
Yeah, very nice.
<i>Thank you, Chef.</i>

23:03.450 --> 23:05.451
(Gordon)
Beautiful.
Go, please.

23:05.518 --> 23:06.885
(Announcer)
The red team is off
to a good start.

23:06.953 --> 23:08.987
And food is leaving the kitchen
in a timely manner.

23:09.055 --> 23:10.489
Oh, my God,
it's really good.

23:10.557 --> 23:11.557
<i>Is it good?</i>
Yeah.

23:11.624 --> 23:12.925
One Sushi,
one chowder.

23:12.992 --> 23:14.159
(All)
Yes, Chef.
Let's go.

23:14.227 --> 23:15.794
Going to the pass
with the Sushi.

23:15.862 --> 23:17.029
(Announcer)
With the blue team

23:17.097 --> 23:18.330
already lagging behind
because of vinny,

23:18.398 --> 23:19.832
Curtis is trying
to get his kitchen

23:19.899 --> 23:21.233
back on track.

23:21.301 --> 23:22.634
Curtis.

23:22.702 --> 23:23.902
Working on it again,

23:23.970 --> 23:25.904
Yeah, [Bleep].

23:25.972 --> 23:28.107
<i>Gentlemen, gentlemen,</i>
<i>gentlemen!</i>

23:28.174 --> 23:30.809
Look at this.
[bleep, bleep, bleep].

23:30.877 --> 23:32.144
Look at that there.

23:32.212 --> 23:33.612
Look at that.
Look--look--

23:33.680 --> 23:34.913
come here, you.

23:34.981 --> 23:36.515
It's not good enough
for me.

23:36.583 --> 23:38.383
It's not good enough
for me.

23:38.451 --> 23:39.551
Yes, Chef.
Working now, Chef.

23:39.619 --> 23:41.186
Sushi's coming back.

23:41.254 --> 23:44.256
Se you're not cooking.

23:44.324 --> 23:46.391
Do you think
that I'm gonna [Bleep]?

23:46.459 --> 23:48.494
You can't even clean
the [Bleep] Off, Curtis.

23:48.561 --> 23:50.763
[Bleep] Right off.

23:50.830 --> 23:52.331
(Curtis)
It looked like a staircase.

23:52.398 --> 23:54.333
Yeah, he got that one
on me.

23:54.400 --> 23:57.469
90 seconds.
90 seconds.

23:57.537 --> 23:59.004
(Announcer)
Curtis' poor execution

23:59.072 --> 24:00.973
of the Sushi...
Service, please.

24:01.040 --> 24:03.275
Go with that. Come back
for the Sushi, God forbid.

24:03.343 --> 24:05.310
(Announcer)
Has resulted
in only one table

24:05.378 --> 24:07.913
of appetizers being served
by the blue kitchen.

24:07.981 --> 24:09.948
Excuse me, I'm so sorry.
You haven't had anything yet?

24:10.016 --> 24:11.383
No, we haven't eaten
anything yet.

24:11.451 --> 24:13.051
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, the red team

24:13.119 --> 24:14.052
has successfully moved on
to entrees.

24:14.120 --> 24:15.554
Appetizers have now gone.

24:15.622 --> 24:16.989
<i>Yes?</i>
Yes, Chef.

24:17.056 --> 24:17.890
<i>We've never started</i>
<i>like this.</i>

24:17.957 --> 24:19.324
Come on,come on.

24:19.392 --> 24:20.459
(Announcer)
With Nona on fish

24:20.527 --> 24:21.760
and Emily on meat...

24:21.828 --> 24:22.828
<i>(Emily)</i>
<i>Beef's out of the oven.</i>

24:22.896 --> 24:24.396
<i>(Woman)</i>
<i>Good.</i>

24:24.464 --> 24:26.632
That's supposed to be
mid-well?
M-well.

24:26.699 --> 24:28.467
(Announcer)
There appears to be
just one small problem.

24:28.535 --> 24:30.402
Look,
that's rare.

24:30.470 --> 24:33.238
Oh, my God.

24:33.306 --> 24:34.339
[Groans]

24:34.407 --> 24:35.974
I'm screwed.

24:36.042 --> 24:38.510
I have to start over.
What a [Bleep] Shame.

24:38.611 --> 24:40.245
Because
of the [Bleep] Beef section.

24:41.815 --> 24:42.848
You're cooking
the halibut perfectly.

24:44.417 --> 24:45.784
<i>But it's getting [Bleep]</i>
<i>Trashed.</i>

24:45.852 --> 24:47.085
<i>(Nona)</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

24:47.153 --> 24:48.253
Unbelievable.
Hope you're happy with her.

24:48.321 --> 24:49.087
<i>(Nona)</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

24:49.155 --> 24:51.190
Not really.

24:54.260 --> 24:56.161
(Announcer)
It's 90 minutes
into dinner service,

24:56.229 --> 24:57.796
and food has been
ridiculously slow

24:57.864 --> 24:59.498
leaving the blue kitchen.

24:59.566 --> 25:01.633
Hello, guys.

25:01.701 --> 25:03.602
(Announcer)
But vinny has a plan
to speed things up.

25:03.670 --> 25:04.970
I'm gonna be perfectly honest
with you.

25:05.038 --> 25:06.038
If you guys order sides,
you're gonna be here

25:06.105 --> 25:06.939
till next Tuesday.

25:07.006 --> 25:08.574
I have zero confidence

25:08.641 --> 25:10.175
that Raj is getting out
garnishes and sides.

25:10.243 --> 25:12.578
No sides.
No sides.

25:12.645 --> 25:14.479
So I came up with a little bit
of a clever idea.

25:14.547 --> 25:15.814
How's the service
this evening?

25:15.882 --> 25:17.316
We couldn't order sides.

25:17.383 --> 25:18.917
Why are you not allowed
to order sides?

25:18.985 --> 25:22.454
Because I guess
we get our food quicker

25:22.522 --> 25:24.857
if we don't order sides.

25:24.924 --> 25:26.558
<i>(James)</i>
<i>No, no, no, no, no.</i>

25:26.626 --> 25:28.193
Um, let me go and speak
to the Chef about this.

25:28.261 --> 25:29.628
Could you check on that?

25:29.696 --> 25:30.896
No sides on there.
I don't know why.

25:30.964 --> 25:32.464
Come over here.
Okay.

25:32.532 --> 25:34.600
Chef?
Yes.

25:34.667 --> 25:36.835
One of his tables, he's telling
them they can only--

25:36.903 --> 25:38.237
they can't have side orders
'cause it takes too long

25:38.304 --> 25:40.606
<i>to get out of the kitchen.</i>

25:40.673 --> 25:42.074
<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>What I said was I'd be happy</i>

25:42.141 --> 25:44.109
to bring 'em to you--
shut up.

25:44.177 --> 25:46.178
He said
they could not have sides

25:46.246 --> 25:47.613
just 'cause it would take
too long.

25:47.680 --> 25:48.847
Come in here.

25:48.915 --> 25:50.415
That is not
what I told them.

25:50.483 --> 25:52.684
Why?
That is not what I told them.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.319
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>What did you tell them?</i>

25:54.387 --> 25:55.988
Exactly what I told them
was this.

25:56.055 --> 25:57.990
I said,
"I'm telling you the truth,

25:58.057 --> 26:00.125
"the sides are delicious,
but it's gonna take a lot longer

26:00.193 --> 26:03.362
if you want sides, so..."
Stop, everybody!

26:03.429 --> 26:05.564
Now Captain vinny here
is telling the customers

26:05.632 --> 26:07.065
not to order sides.

26:07.133 --> 26:08.267
Come here.

26:08.334 --> 26:09.368
Did you tell him
not to order sides?

26:09.435 --> 26:10.969
Of course not.

26:11.037 --> 26:12.871
Would I say that?
Don't [Bleep] Shout at me.

26:12.939 --> 26:15.107
[Bleep]Face.
You told him that.

26:15.174 --> 26:17.476
Don't push the sides,
so I look good.
I'm ready with the sides.

26:17.543 --> 26:19.845
Look, I got all the sides ready.
I'm waiting for them--

26:19.913 --> 26:21.613
<i>(gordon)</i>
<i>So why is he not taking</i>
<i>the orders?</i>

26:21.681 --> 26:22.714
I have no idea.
Look at these sides.

26:22.782 --> 26:24.416
These are all ready.
I'm--I'm--

26:24.484 --> 26:26.885
he's--okay...

26:26.953 --> 26:28.453
Do you want
to know the truth?

26:28.521 --> 26:29.454
Yeah, I do want
to know the truth.

26:29.522 --> 26:30.956
The truth is,
I have no faith

26:31.024 --> 26:34.059
that he's gonna be able
to get the sides out.

26:35.662 --> 26:37.562
You better understand
one [Bleep] Thing.

26:37.630 --> 26:40.399
You do not decide
what goes out of this kitchen.

26:40.466 --> 26:42.668
I do now.
<i>Get out!</i>

26:42.735 --> 26:44.569
<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>
Get out, you!

26:55.674 --> 26:57.541
(Announcer)
It's an hour and a half

26:57.609 --> 26:58.842
into dinner service,
and vinny's plan

26:58.910 --> 27:00.210
to move things along...

27:00.278 --> 27:02.046
Now Captain vinny here
is telling the customers

27:02.113 --> 27:04.114
not to order sides.

27:04.182 --> 27:06.050
(Announcer)
Hasn't exactly been met
with gratitude

27:06.117 --> 27:08.352
by Chef Ramsay.
Get out!

27:08.420 --> 27:11.188
Yes, Chef.

27:11.256 --> 27:12.690
Get out, you!

27:18.830 --> 27:20.531
I really did
what I thought was best

27:20.598 --> 27:23.400
for the guests
and the customers.

27:23.468 --> 27:27.237
I said exactly
what was the truth,

27:27.305 --> 27:29.640
I felt bad
for the people.

27:29.708 --> 27:32.743
(Announcer)
While vinny contemplates
his fate in Hell's Kitchen...

27:32.811 --> 27:35.212
They're not gonna want
to serve that, are they?

27:35.280 --> 27:37.614
(Announcer)
Emily is contemplating
why her meat still isn't done.

27:37.682 --> 27:40.217
I'm hoping the halibut
and the beef is arriving soon.

27:40.285 --> 27:42.619
Just waiting to go.

27:42.687 --> 27:44.355
The medium-rare beef
is resting.

27:44.422 --> 27:45.489
It'll be about a minute
and a half, Chef.

27:45.557 --> 27:46.757
Where's the mid-well
for the halibut?

27:46.825 --> 27:47.658
The mid-well's still
in the [Bleep] Oven.

27:47.726 --> 27:48.826
[Bleep] Me.

27:48.893 --> 27:50.194
(Emily)
It was still rare.

27:50.261 --> 27:51.895
I don't know what happened.

27:51.963 --> 27:53.864
It was like
reverse cooking over there.

27:53.932 --> 27:56.166
Emily, Emily, Emily!
<i>(Emily)</i>
<i>Yes, Chef.</i>

27:56.234 --> 27:58.569
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Halibut's screwed now.</i>

27:58.636 --> 28:00.437
I don't know
how to [Bleep] Cook meat.

28:04.075 --> 28:05.576
What?

28:05.643 --> 28:06.777
Turn that [Bleep] Up.
<i>(Emily)</i>
<i>I just did.</i>

28:06.845 --> 28:08.278
I'm [Bleep].

28:08.346 --> 28:09.680
I'm [Bleep]
On the halibut again.

28:09.748 --> 28:12.883
We're all freakin' sinking.

28:12.951 --> 28:14.618
What do you mean
you can't cook meat?

28:14.686 --> 28:15.853
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>If you've given up...</i>

28:15.920 --> 28:16.987
<i>(Emily)</i>
<i>No, Chef.</i>

28:17.055 --> 28:18.288
Do me a favor.
[bleep] Off home.

28:18.356 --> 28:19.690
Walking around
with your face on the floor

28:19.758 --> 28:20.824
when you've put your team
in the [Bleep].

28:20.892 --> 28:22.126
Yes, Chef.

28:22.193 --> 28:23.794
(Announcer)
While Emily struggles

28:23.862 --> 28:25.029
with her meat
and her confidence...

28:25.096 --> 28:26.397
You [Bleep] Up.
I need to see you bounce back.

28:26.464 --> 28:28.599
I've bounced, Chef.

28:28.666 --> 28:30.567
(Announcer)
Back in the blue kitchen,

28:30.635 --> 28:32.736
Boris is looking to take control
of Trevor's fish.

28:32.804 --> 28:34.071
Trev, you okay?

28:34.139 --> 28:35.873
Ah.
<i>All right.</i>

28:35.940 --> 28:37.408
You know, I'm there
for my guys.

28:37.475 --> 28:38.175
You know,
I'm the Captain.

28:38.243 --> 28:39.743
Okay, guys, I'm here.

28:39.811 --> 28:41.478
Either I'm going all the way
with the ship,

28:41.546 --> 28:42.579
or I'm going down
with the ship.

28:42.647 --> 28:43.981
The [Bleep] Time is here.

28:44.049 --> 28:46.917
Let me know. I'll do
the [Bleep] Scallops, okay?

28:46.985 --> 28:48.952
Boris, he thinks he needs
to be the top guy,

28:49.020 --> 28:51.255
'cause, you know,
whatever reason.

28:51.322 --> 28:53.824
Come on, brother.
Leave 'em alone. I got 'em.

28:53.892 --> 28:55.426
He kept muscling me
out of the way

28:55.493 --> 28:56.693
and trying
to do everything.

28:56.761 --> 28:58.195
You want the responsibility,
it's all yours.

28:58.263 --> 28:59.696
I'm like, "oh, come on,
get over yourself."

28:59.764 --> 29:00.864
Scallops coming up
right now.

29:00.932 --> 29:02.399
Go
wants perfect scallops.

29:02.467 --> 29:04.134
You know what?
No problem.

29:04.202 --> 29:05.602
Here you go,
Chef.

29:05.670 --> 29:06.970
I would never send in
anything less

29:07.038 --> 29:08.772
than [Bleep] Perfect.

29:08.840 --> 29:10.607
How much [Bleep]
Do you want to [Bleep] Take?

29:17.582 --> 29:19.016
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Oh, guys, come on.</i>

29:19.084 --> 29:20.717
<i>Oh, come on.</i>

29:20.785 --> 29:22.219
Come on, come on,
come on.

29:22.287 --> 29:24.154
<i>One's cooked perfectly,</i>

29:24.222 --> 29:25.456
<i>and one's raw.</i>

29:25.523 --> 29:26.890
[Bleep].

29:26.958 --> 29:28.759
Trev, why are you
not cooking the scallops?

29:28.827 --> 29:30.694
Boris grabbed it
and ran with it, Chef.

29:30.762 --> 29:32.830
How long
for the scallops?

29:32.897 --> 29:34.364
30 seconds,
scallops, yes.

29:34.432 --> 29:36.166
[Bleep] Off.

29:36.234 --> 29:37.768
[Bleep] Right off.

29:37.836 --> 29:39.570
(Announcer)
Thanks to Boris...

29:39.637 --> 29:41.205
I'm gonna go inside the fridge
and get more scallops.

29:41.272 --> 29:42.473
(Announcer)
Appetizers are still not leaving

29:42.540 --> 29:43.941
the blue kitchen.

29:44.008 --> 29:45.375
Nearly two hours
into service,

29:45.443 --> 29:46.510
two Risotto,
two spaghetti,

29:46.578 --> 29:48.278
one [Bleep] Salad.

29:48.346 --> 29:51.248
Meanwhile, the red kitchen
has overcome their mistakes

29:51.316 --> 29:52.349
and served
half their entrees.

29:52.417 --> 29:53.484
How does it taste?

29:53.551 --> 29:55.185
Tastes delicious.
Awesome.

29:55.253 --> 29:56.487
Beef's coming.

29:56.554 --> 29:58.055
Beef is coming.
Chicken is coming.

29:58.123 --> 29:59.890
(Announcer)
And Melissa, on garnish,

29:59.958 --> 30:02.426
is looking to keep things
running smoothly.

30:02.494 --> 30:03.560
Beef in sauce,
Chef.

30:06.698 --> 30:08.232
Runny mash.
Yes, Chef.

30:08.299 --> 30:09.166
Hey, hold on.
Hold on.

30:09.234 --> 30:11.135
It gets better.

30:11.202 --> 30:12.603
<i>One, they're Stone cold.</i>

30:12.670 --> 30:13.770
And secondly,
we don't even need them.

30:13.838 --> 30:15.372
There's
a Wellington up, Chef.

30:15.440 --> 30:18.609
[Sighs]

30:18.676 --> 30:21.411
<i>Come here, you.</i>

30:21.479 --> 30:24.081
One salmon, one halibut
one chicken, one beef.

30:24.149 --> 30:26.283
Where is the Wellington?

30:26.351 --> 30:27.851
Wellingtup
right now.
Where?

30:27.919 --> 30:29.153
Where's the Wellington?

30:29.220 --> 30:30.320
It's not
in the window, Chef.

30:30.388 --> 30:31.688
It's right there.

30:31.756 --> 30:33.123
It's on the next table.
Yes, Chef.

30:33.191 --> 30:34.958
I just put up
the wrong thing.

30:35.026 --> 30:36.727
I can't explain it.

30:36.794 --> 30:38.595
It's [Bleep] Embarrassing.

30:38.663 --> 30:40.697
You are about
to sink your team.

30:40.765 --> 30:42.533
Now...
Focus, Chef, yes.

30:42.600 --> 30:44.067
No.
Don't focus.

30:44.135 --> 30:46.036
Swap places
with Jillian.

30:46.104 --> 30:47.704
Now [Bleep] Off.
Yes, Chef.

30:47.772 --> 30:49.206
Guys, I have to go out
into the dining room.

30:49.274 --> 30:50.974
<i>Get out!</i>
<i>Get out!</i>

30:51.042 --> 30:52.176
<i>[Bleep] The explanation.</i>

30:52.243 --> 30:55.946
Get out!

30:56.014 --> 30:57.414
Jill.

30:57.482 --> 30:59.783
I look like
a bumbling [Bleep] Idiot.

30:59.851 --> 31:01.785
I have table 71 upstairs.

31:01.853 --> 31:03.554
I need your coat,
and you got to take my coat.

31:03.621 --> 31:06.223
[Crying]
I am so frustrated

31:06.291 --> 31:08.091
and pissed off
at myself,

31:08.159 --> 31:10.727
'cause I know I am good.

31:10.795 --> 31:13.230
<i>(Jillian)</i>
<i>What are you guys doing?</i>
<i>What's going on?</i>

31:13.298 --> 31:14.865
(Announcer)
With Jillian quickly solving
the issues

31:14.933 --> 31:16.099
on the garnish station...

31:16.167 --> 31:18.235
Jillian, how's the garnish
for my wellies?

31:18.303 --> 31:21.171
I got your mashed potatoes,
and I got your carrots.
Let's go, please.

31:21.239 --> 31:22.839
(Announcer)
The red kitchen
is back in a groove.

31:22.907 --> 31:24.942
Service, please.

31:25.009 --> 31:27.244
Come on, ladies.
Come on, ladies.

31:27.312 --> 31:28.879
(Announcer)
Meanwhile, what put
the blue kitchen in trouble

31:28.947 --> 31:30.180
at the start
of service...

31:30.248 --> 31:31.715
Let's go.
What's going on on Sushi?

31:31.783 --> 31:32.950
He's not even cooking anything,

31:33.017 --> 31:34.418
and yet we're in a mess.

31:34.485 --> 31:35.419
(Announcer)
Continues to plague them

31:35.486 --> 31:36.687
almost two hours later.

31:36.754 --> 31:38.222
Sushi.

31:38.289 --> 31:40.224
<i>Can you believe</i>
<i>we're dragging on Sushi?</i>

31:40.291 --> 31:42.059
Curtis got the kitchen
off to a really bad start.

31:42.126 --> 31:44.094
Damn it.
I'm [Bleep] Trying.

31:44.162 --> 31:45.729
You know,
I could slide over

31:45.797 --> 31:47.531
and help,
but that's not my problem.

31:47.599 --> 31:50.801
Let him sink.

31:50.868 --> 31:53.737
I've got the Sushi now
with no wasabi.

31:53.805 --> 31:56.740
You, [Bleep] Off
out of here.

31:56.808 --> 31:59.910
Gonna tell me
to [Bleep] Off.

31:59.978 --> 32:01.378
Man, [Bleep] That.

32:01.446 --> 32:03.347
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>I've had enough.</i>

32:03.414 --> 32:04.648
I've had enough!

32:04.716 --> 32:06.617
I tried my best.

32:06.684 --> 32:09.720
At least, like some [Bleep],
at least I [Bleep] Tried.

32:13.258 --> 32:15.559
Give me a break.

32:15.627 --> 32:18.495
Damn it.
[groans]

32:18.563 --> 32:20.130
(Announcer)
As the number
of blue team members in the dorm

32:20.198 --> 32:20.998
is multiplying...

32:21.065 --> 32:23.734
Look at the [Bleep] Garnish.

32:23.801 --> 32:25.402
(Announcer)
So are Raj's pans of garnish.

32:25.470 --> 32:26.970
Come here.

32:27.038 --> 32:30.474
The big [Bleep] Sack
of piss and wind.

32:30.541 --> 32:32.409
You're stacking up
your garnishes,

32:32.477 --> 32:34.044
and it's getting longer
and longer

32:34.112 --> 32:35.579
<i>and longer and longer.</i>

32:35.647 --> 32:37.247
In about five minutes' time,

32:37.315 --> 32:39.283
you're gonna have
all those [Bleep] Garnishes

32:39.350 --> 32:40.751
right outside the kitchen.

32:40.818 --> 32:41.718
That's all I need, Chef.
Shut up.

32:41.786 --> 32:43.086
Get out!

32:43.154 --> 32:44.488
I don't know
what to do.

32:44.555 --> 32:45.555
I mean,
I don't know how to--

32:45.623 --> 32:47.024
I don't know.

32:47.091 --> 32:48.592
I don't know
how to handle the situation.

32:48.660 --> 32:49.993
I mean...
Get out!

32:50.061 --> 32:52.062
<i>Now!</i>

32:52.130 --> 32:54.298
I don't even know
what the hell is going on

32:54.365 --> 32:56.166
or what happened
or why...

32:56.234 --> 33:00.604
[Breathing heavily]

33:00.672 --> 33:02.306
(Announcer)
With three Chefs
from the blue team

33:02.373 --> 33:03.473
cooling off
in the dorm...

33:03.541 --> 33:04.941
[Shouts]

33:05.009 --> 33:07.277
Two salads coming
right now.

33:07.345 --> 33:08.779
(Announcer)
The remaining team members
are eager

33:08.846 --> 33:09.713
to show Chef Ramsay

33:09.781 --> 33:12.382
what they're capable of.

33:12.450 --> 33:13.517
<i>(Gordon)</i>
<i>Come here, all of you.</i>

33:13.584 --> 33:14.785
[Bleep].

33:14.852 --> 33:17.788
There's the walnuts
on one.

33:17.855 --> 33:18.955
There's the walnuts
on the other.

33:19.023 --> 33:20.857
[Bleep].

33:20.925 --> 33:22.559
<i>Now you, you, you,</i>
<i>and you,</i>

33:22.627 --> 33:23.927

33:23.995 --> 33:31.268
Now you,

33:31.336 --> 33:33.804
Get out.
Get out!

33:33.871 --> 33:36.406
(Louis)
Not only did he throw us
all out of the kitchen,

33:36.474 --> 33:38.408
he led us
out of the kitchen.

33:38.476 --> 33:42.212
It makes you feel
like you're this big.

33:42.280 --> 33:45.248
Almost had
that [Bleep] Table.

33:45.316 --> 33:47.617
<i>(Louis)Were calling ens</i>
<i>for the last two hours.</i>

33:47.685 --> 33:49.252
I didn't come here
to look like

33:49.320 --> 33:51.822
an [Bleep] Two nights
in a row, okay?

33:51.889 --> 33:56.993
<i>And we're gonna do it again</i>
<i>tomorrow if we don't--</i>
okay, fellas, yeah.

33:57.061 --> 33:58.128
How dare you condescend
to me?

33:58.196 --> 33:59.830
I'm 28 years old!

33:59.897 --> 34:01.765
I've been a professional
in this industry 14 years!

34:01.833 --> 34:03.333
I work at a camp,
and I work my [Bleep] Ass off.

34:03.401 --> 34:05.102
Listen, listen, listen.
You're 50.

34:05.169 --> 34:06.236
How dare
you [Bleep] Condescend to me?

34:06.304 --> 34:08.071
<i>You stupid [Bleep].</i>

34:08.139 --> 34:09.438
Shut the [Bleep] Up.

34:09.507 --> 34:11.041
Listen, listen.
Shut the [Bleep] Up.

34:11.109 --> 34:12.509
How dare you condescend
to me?

34:12.577 --> 34:13.610
Bro,
you're 50 years old,

34:13.678 --> 34:14.643
and you couldn't pick
parsley!

34:14.712 --> 34:15.344
You're a [Bleep]
Douche bag.

34:15.413 --> 34:16.545
Don't, bro.

34:16.614 --> 34:18.415
You're attacking me,
[Bleep].

34:18.483 --> 34:19.549
You're throwing [Bleep]
At me?

34:19.617 --> 34:21.184
Shut up.

34:21.252 --> 34:23.786
[Bleep] You, man.
[bleep] You, you bitch.

34:23.855 --> 34:25.722

Come on, man!

34:28.485 --> 34:29.719
(Announcer)
After a complete meltdown

34:29.786 --> 34:30.786
in the blue kitchen...

34:30.855 --> 34:32.121
Get out.

34:32.190 --> 34:34.123
(Announcer)
Where everyone struggled,

34:34.192 --> 34:36.460
one Chef seems to be getting
a lot of attention.

34:36.527 --> 34:38.094
<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>Bro, you're 50 years old,</i>

34:38.161 --> 34:38.962

parsley!

You're a [Bleep] Douche bag.

34:39.964 --> 34:41.130
Don't, bro.

34:41.199 --> 34:42.666
You're attacking me,
[Bleep].

34:42.734 --> 34:44.801
[Bleep] You, man.
[bleep] You.

34:44.869 --> 34:47.237
Raj, you're a waste of life.
[bleep] You, bitch.

34:47.304 --> 34:48.739
You're a [Bleep] Waste
of life, Raj.

34:48.806 --> 34:49.873
[Bleep] You.

34:49.940 --> 34:51.341
They just blame me

34:51.409 --> 34:52.842
'cause I'm an easy target
for them.

34:52.909 --> 34:54.011
You know, here I am.

34:54.078 --> 34:55.879
I'm in that snake pit.

34:55.947 --> 34:57.047
And I'm the mongoose.

34:57.114 --> 34:58.181
And the mongoose is trying

34:58.249 --> 34:59.816
to fight the cobra.

34:59.884 --> 35:01.418
Listen, if you guys want
to get out of this,

35:01.486 --> 35:02.886
you listen to me,
okay?

35:02.954 --> 35:04.554
Okay, yeah.
Tell us how it is.

35:04.622 --> 35:05.889
Show us what we got to do
to do a better job.

35:05.957 --> 35:06.957
(Announcer)
While a horrible night

35:07.025 --> 35:08.191
has torn the blue team apart.

35:08.259 --> 35:09.893
This guy is just too much.

35:09.961 --> 35:11.662
(Announcer)
Back in the red kitchen...

35:11.729 --> 35:13.263
Come on,
bust this out.

35:13.331 --> 35:15.098
(Announcer)
The women have banded together.

35:15.166 --> 35:16.500
Last table--
keep it going.

35:16.567 --> 35:18.001
(All)
Yes, Chef.

35:18.069 --> 35:19.236
(Announcer)
And they have a complete service

35:19.303 --> 35:20.837
in their sights.

35:20.905 --> 35:22.539
Hot coming down the line.
Walk with me to the salmon.

35:22.607 --> 35:24.241
Tagliatelle's ready.
Yeah, that's it.

35:24.308 --> 35:25.475
See the Wellington.

35:25.543 --> 35:27.244
Et's go.
Thank you.

35:27.311 --> 35:28.545
Well done.

35:28.613 --> 35:29.880
Thank you, Chef.

35:29.947 --> 35:31.948
Yeah,
not a massive celebration,

35:32.016 --> 35:33.150
but well done.

35:33.217 --> 35:34.785
I told you
I could cook!

35:34.852 --> 35:38.021
We finished
dinner service, yay!

35:38.089 --> 35:39.589
[All cheering]

35:39.657 --> 35:40.891
Whoo!
I didn't get kicked off.

35:44.262 --> 35:47.497
Men, you lost.

35:47.565 --> 35:49.766
Vinny decided
that it was a bright idea

35:49.834 --> 35:51.168
<i>to tell the customers,</i>

35:51.235 --> 35:52.769
<i>"don't order sides</i>

35:52.837 --> 35:53.904
<i>because the kitchen</i>
<i>can't deliver."</i>

35:53.971 --> 35:55.238
How dare you?

35:55.306 --> 35:56.940
That's my decision
and not yours.

35:57.008 --> 35:59.576
None of you are here
to kiss my ass,

35:59.644 --> 36:01.311
but I expect
some [Bleep] Respect!

36:01.379 --> 36:04.748
Yes, Chef.

36:04.816 --> 36:07.350
Curtis,
why was Sushi

36:07.418 --> 36:08.852
so hard for you
this evening?

36:08.920 --> 36:12.923
I have no excuse,
Chef.

36:12.990 --> 36:15.959
Yes, Chef, I did.

36:16.027 --> 36:18.495
All eight of you come up
with two individuals

36:18.563 --> 36:19.763
for elimination.

36:19.831 --> 36:21.064
(All)
Yes, Chef.

36:21.132 --> 36:23.867
Piss off, guys, yeah?

36:23.935 --> 36:26.536
We lost miserably.

36:26.604 --> 36:28.371
I understand
Ramsay being upset,

36:28.439 --> 36:29.873
but, you know,
I was pissed too.

36:29.941 --> 36:30.674
Who wants to start?
Two people.

36:30.742 --> 36:32.109
Well, you know one.

36:32.176 --> 36:33.810
Obviously, Raj.

36:33.878 --> 36:35.479
<i>(All)</i>
<i>Raj.</i>

36:35.546 --> 36:37.347
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>All right.</i>
Sorry, Raj.

36:37.415 --> 36:38.448
All right, first nominee's Raj
for obvious reasons.

36:38.516 --> 36:40.250
They're gonna vote
for me

36:40.318 --> 36:41.952
when vinny goes out
to the dining room

36:42.019 --> 36:44.955
and tells them,
"don't order any sides

36:45.022 --> 36:47.057
'cause Raj can't cook 'em."

36:47.125 --> 36:48.759
What an evil thing to do
to somebody.

36:48.826 --> 36:50.327
I mean,
that's sick!

36:50.394 --> 36:51.628
<i>(Man)</i>
<i>So who's the other one?</i>

36:51.696 --> 36:52.796
(Trev)
Curtis.

36:52.864 --> 36:54.664
<i>(Russest have to be ,</i>

36:54.732 --> 36:56.466
Curtis kind of put us behind,
you know.

36:56.534 --> 36:59.503
<i>It's nothing personal.</i>
<i>Who you going with?</i>

36:59.570 --> 37:01.471
<i>(Vinny)</i>
<i>I'm gonna pick you, Curtis.</i>
<i>No hard feelings.</i>

37:01.539 --> 37:03.306
That's it, right?
Raj and Curtis.

37:03.374 --> 37:05.075
Sorry, bro.

37:05.143 --> 37:06.276
(Curtis)
My teammates put me up there,

37:06.344 --> 37:09.746
but guess what?

37:09.814 --> 37:11.448
It wasn't just me.

37:11.516 --> 37:13.183
And I ain't giving up.

37:13.251 --> 37:14.918
I was still a little bit
clueless about the menu,

37:14.986 --> 37:18.021
but, honestly, with Boris,
the last two services,

37:18.089 --> 37:19.589
<i>there's been problems.</i>
He flips out.

37:19.657 --> 37:21.091
One thing
I did notice tonight--

37:21.159 --> 37:23.026
when Boris kind of shoved me
out of the way

37:23.094 --> 37:24.594
and started doing
[Bleep] Scallops,

37:24.662 --> 37:25.896
I said,
"I got this handled..."

37:25.963 --> 37:27.597
Boris didn't really enter
my mind,

37:27.665 --> 37:29.466
but then as soon as his name
started getting mentioned,

37:29.534 --> 37:31.434
I started thinking
about all the things.

37:31.502 --> 37:33.069
Well, yeah, he did try

37:33.137 --> 37:34.104
and muscle me
out of my own station today.

37:47.385 --> 37:48.919
Right.

37:48.986 --> 37:50.320
<i>Boris...</i>

37:50.388 --> 37:52.122
Yes, Chef.

37:52.190 --> 37:54.558
Who's the first nominee
and why?

37:54.625 --> 37:56.793
The first nominee
on the men's team tonight, Chef,

37:56.861 --> 37:58.128
is Raj.

37:58.196 --> 38:00.797
He's done nothing
but sabotage us,

38:00.865 --> 38:02.265
<i>drag us down,</i>

38:02.333 --> 38:04.901
and just did not contribute
a single thing.

38:04.969 --> 38:06.236
That is a lie.

38:06.304 --> 38:08.104
I mean,
that's a ridiculous accusation.

38:08.172 --> 38:09.639
Don't even waste
your breath.

38:09.707 --> 38:11.107
The seven of us
picked you twice.

38:11.175 --> 38:13.243
I'd be crying upstairs
if I was you

38:13.311 --> 38:14.744
I'd be humiliated.

38:14.812 --> 38:18.048
Clearly,
a lot of team harmony here.

38:18.115 --> 38:21.885
Trev,
second nominee and why.

38:21.953 --> 38:25.288
After listening
to my fellow teammates here,

38:25.356 --> 38:28.325
the general consensus...

38:28.392 --> 38:30.727
It's Boris.

38:30.795 --> 38:32.762
Why?

38:32.830 --> 38:34.431
He shoved me right off
of the scallops tonight,

38:34.498 --> 38:35.365
<i>and he thinks he's superman</i>

38:35.433 --> 38:37.634
and he can do everything.

38:39.036 --> 38:41.371
Boris, Raj,
step forward.

38:45.610 --> 38:50.146
Unbelievable.
Wait a second.

38:50.214 --> 38:52.682
Somebody else needs
to be up here.

38:54.518 --> 38:56.887
Vinny.

38:56.954 --> 38:58.321
Step forward.

39:07.806 --> 39:09.506
(Announcer)
After a horrible dinner service,

39:09.574 --> 39:11.041
the blue team
has nominated

39:11.109 --> 39:13.310
Raj and Boris
for elimination.

39:13.378 --> 39:15.946
But Chef Ramsay has
a nominee of his own.

39:16.014 --> 39:17.948
Vinny, step forward.

39:21.386 --> 39:23.187
<i>I am pissed.</i>

39:23.254 --> 39:25.122
You have no right
to recommend

39:25.190 --> 39:26.557
to the guests
not to have

39:26.624 --> 39:28.325
<i>a side</i>
<i>with an entree.</i>

39:28.393 --> 39:30.894
After my first table waited
nearly two hours

39:30.962 --> 39:32.896
for their appetizers,
I just wanted them

39:32.964 --> 39:34.932
to have an opportunity
to experience some of your food.

39:34.999 --> 39:36.166
That's what
they came here for.

39:36.234 --> 39:37.935
Entrees on that menu

39:38.002 --> 39:40.504
are designed
to go with sides.

39:40.572 --> 39:41.505
<i>Is that clear?</i>

39:41.573 --> 39:43.440
Yes, Chef.

39:43.508 --> 39:46.276
Tell me why you think you
should stay in Hell's Kitchen.

39:46.344 --> 39:48.011
I'm sorry
for my mistake.

39:48.079 --> 39:50.347
<i>I make a mistake,</i>
<i>i make a mistake once</i>

39:50.415 --> 39:51.915
and only once.

39:51.983 --> 39:54.418
Raj.

39:54.486 --> 39:56.053
<i>Why do you think you</i>

39:56.121 --> 39:57.755
should stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

39:57.822 --> 39:59.623
I should stay
in Hell's Kitchen, Chef,

39:59.691 --> 40:02.259
because I am being
falsely accused,

40:02.327 --> 40:04.928
<i>and I'm getting more familiar</i>
<i>with everything,</i>

40:04.996 --> 40:06.130
and it's gonna be good.

40:06.197 --> 40:07.164
I need a little more time.

40:07.232 --> 40:08.265
I'm a slow learner.

40:08.333 --> 40:09.700
You're 40-[Bleep]-9.

40:09.768 --> 40:10.934
I need a fast learner.

40:11.002 --> 40:12.336
Yes, Chef.

40:13.671 --> 40:16.940
Boris.
Yes, Chef.

40:17.008 --> 40:18.442
Why should you stay
in Hell's Kitchen?

40:18.510 --> 40:20.210
I'm a strong team player.

40:20.278 --> 40:22.279
I'm one
of the stronger Chefs here.

40:22.347 --> 40:24.948
In a time of need, I worked very
hard to help my teammates out.

40:25.016 --> 40:27.718
And I'm gonna be
the last man standing, Chef.

40:27.786 --> 40:29.386
Okay.

40:29.454 --> 40:31.422
<i>I've seen enough.</i>

40:31.489 --> 40:33.957
The person leaving
Hell's Kitchen

40:34.025 --> 40:35.492
is...

40:37.462 --> 40:39.696
Curtis.

40:42.667 --> 40:44.301
<i>Get your ass over here.</i>

40:44.369 --> 40:45.702
Because you completely destroyed

40:45.770 --> 40:47.404
<i>the slim possibility</i>

40:47.472 --> 40:50.240
<i>of the blue team</i>
<i>succeeding this evening.</i>

40:50.308 --> 40:51.842
Give me your jacket

40:51.910 --> 40:52.976
<i>and leave</i>
<i>Hell's Kitchen, please.</i>

41:01.352 --> 41:04.254
(Curtis)
Words can't even describe
how I feel right now.

41:04.322 --> 41:07.858
I mean, this experience
meant so much to me,

41:07.926 --> 41:09.293
so much to my family.

41:09.360 --> 41:11.528
I'm sorry.
Daddy gave it his best.

41:11.596 --> 41:16.233
[Crying] But I swear to God,
I'll make it up to you.

41:17.769 --> 41:19.903
Get a good night's sleep,

41:19.971 --> 41:22.339
because the seven of you need
to fight back...

41:22.407 --> 41:24.374
Quickly.
(All)
Yes, Chef.

41:24.442 --> 41:25.676
Now [Bleep] Off.

41:28.146 --> 41:30.948
The blue team should get used
to getting their asses kicked.

41:31.015 --> 41:32.950
They're like little dominoes,

41:33.017 --> 41:34.918
and the red team's gonna knock
each one of them out.

41:34.986 --> 41:36.353
[Laughs]

41:36.421 --> 41:38.021
I'm there scrambling,

41:38.089 --> 41:39.823
trying to save
my [Bleep] Guys' asses.

41:39.891 --> 41:42.192
They threw me
under not only the bus,

41:42.260 --> 41:43.927
they threw me under the train,
the plane,

41:43.995 --> 41:45.329
the helicopter,
and the [Bleep] Buggy.

41:45.396 --> 41:49.032
I know that the guys in my team
are [Bleep] Their pants

41:49.100 --> 41:51.568
knowing that Raj
is going to destroy them.

41:51.636 --> 41:54.238
I'm here to stay,
whether you like it or not,

41:54.305 --> 41:55.672
'cause I am the best!

41:55.740 --> 41:58.175
[Exclaims]

41:58.243 --> 41:59.276
[Laughs]

41:59.344 --> 42:00.844
God.

42:00.912 --> 42:02.813
Curtis might have been
a good ol' boy,

42:02.881 --> 42:05.115
but, unfortunately,
he wasn't good at cooking.

42:11.256 --> 42:12.823
Somebody take control.

42:12.891 --> 42:14.525
(Announcer)
On <i>Hell's Kitchen...</i>

42:14.592 --> 42:16.159
This is gonna be
real ugly.

42:16.227 --> 42:17.961
(Announcer)
It's Sabrina...

42:18.029 --> 42:19.796
You guys all need to grow
some [Bleep] Balls.

42:19.864 --> 42:21.532
(Announcer)
In an all-out war
with her teammates.

42:21.599 --> 42:23.500
All these bitches
don't deserve to be here.

42:23.568 --> 42:25.302
(Announcer)
And on the blue team...

42:25.370 --> 42:26.103
What the [Bleep]
Have you done so far?

42:26.170 --> 42:27.738
Shut up!

42:27.805 --> 42:29.339
(Announcer)
The fighting reaches
epic proportions.

42:29.407 --> 42:30.507
Shut the [Bleep] Up.

42:30.575 --> 42:31.909
Pow!
You [Bleep] Snake.

42:31.976 --> 42:33.377
Come on, man.

42:33.444 --> 42:35.279
(Announcer)
But one Chef goes too far...

42:35.346 --> 42:37.047
(Man)
You son of a bitch.

42:37.115 --> 42:38.115
(Woman)
Look out! Look out!
Look out!

42:42.554 --> 42:44.221
(Announcer)
On a combative...

42:44.289 --> 42:45.622
Say that again, eh?
No, Chef. Yes, Chef.

42:45.690 --> 42:46.456
Say that again.
(Announcer)
Intense...

42:46.524 --> 42:48.759
Raw! Raw!

42:48.826 --> 42:50.327
(Announcer)
And shocking episode.
You suck.

42:50.395 --> 42:51.762
Get out of my [Bleep] Face.

42:51.829 --> 42:53.163
Bitch.

42:53.231 --> 42:54.798
[Sirens wailing]

42:54.866 --> 42:56.700
(Announcer)
That's next time
