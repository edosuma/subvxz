WEBVTT

00:00.873 --> 00:02.873
Previously on Greenleaf.

00:04.607 --> 00:06.607
Grace, what happened?

00:07.475 --> 00:08.747
Dady shoot Mac.

00:08.781 --> 00:10.781
This is Sophia's father, Ray.

00:10.793 --> 00:13.028
Our custody agreement
says I am to be consulted

00:13.062 --> 00:14.730
<i>if you take her across the state line.</i>

00:14.764 --> 00:16.431
<i>I'm taking her back to Phoenix.</i>

00:16.466 --> 00:18.166
Tell me what is going on.

00:18.201 --> 00:20.102
I'm sorry, Mae. I can't.

00:20.136 --> 00:22.337
Lady Mae's annual luncheon
is coming up in a few weeks.

00:22.372 --> 00:24.039
I can't wait.

00:24.073 --> 00:25.607
Kevin: <i>I just want to make people feel</i>

00:25.641 --> 00:27.008
like I always wanted to feel...

00:27.043 --> 00:28.276
cared for.

00:28.311 --> 00:29.745
It's working.

00:29.779 --> 00:31.127
Until you come clean with me

00:31.162 --> 00:33.215
about whatever's been going on with you,

00:33.249 --> 00:34.282
I want you out of our bed.

00:34.317 --> 00:36.451
<i>If you don't do it soon,</i>

00:36.486 --> 00:38.019
<i>I want you out of the house.</i>

00:53.203 --> 00:54.904
Bishop: <i>Moses said,
"Lord, I can't go on!"</i>

00:54.937 --> 00:57.906
<i>And the Lord said, "You will go on!"</i>

00:57.940 --> 01:01.009
<i>And Moses said, "Lord, I can't go on!"</i>

01:01.043 --> 01:03.812
And the Lord said, "You will go on!"

01:03.846 --> 01:08.116
And Moses said,
"I don't have what it takes!"

01:08.151 --> 01:10.619
And the Lord said, "I'm going
to give you what it takes

01:10.653 --> 01:12.754
<i>to deliver these stubborn people</i>

01:12.789 --> 01:15.424
<i>to the land that
I have prepared for them!</i>

01:15.848 --> 01:18.811
Because I got news for you, Moses!

01:19.695 --> 01:21.459
I am Jehovah,

01:22.188 --> 01:24.841
<i>the Lord of Hosts, and I...</i>

01:26.877 --> 01:28.789
I ain't done with you yet!"

01:29.772 --> 01:31.731
I feel like singing this morning.

01:32.742 --> 01:35.377

01:35.411 --> 01:39.181

02:20.322 --> 02:21.749
How'd we do?

02:22.925 --> 02:24.626
Sykes: <i>That's the fourth week in a row.</i>

02:24.660 --> 02:26.595
Attendance is down. Tithing is down.

02:26.629 --> 02:29.030
These things are seasonal,
though, Connie.

02:29.065 --> 02:30.031
You know that.

02:30.066 --> 02:31.066
Rain is seasonal.

02:31.100 --> 02:33.698
That there, that's Katrina.

02:33.732 --> 02:36.404
Oh, what a a blessing
you ladies were this morning

02:36.439 --> 02:37.820
with that trio.

02:37.855 --> 02:39.841
Thank you, Bishop.

02:39.876 --> 02:41.710
Fred and Misty are still
pressuring the board

02:41.744 --> 02:43.912
about reinstating Jacob.

02:43.946 --> 02:46.815
- Jacob?
- I know how you feel about that.

02:46.849 --> 02:49.629
When we were riding high and I
put that boy on the program,

02:49.663 --> 02:52.988
I was getting calls from
you, Connie, wailing, "Why?"

02:53.022 --> 02:54.389
I know, but it might just be time

02:54.423 --> 02:56.057
for a fresh face, that's all.

02:56.092 --> 02:58.860
Someone unsullied
by all this controversy.

02:58.895 --> 03:01.396
To restore Jacob to the pulpit now

03:01.430 --> 03:03.431
would divert him from his destiny.

03:03.466 --> 03:06.142
- Then put Grace up there.
- Gra... Grace?

03:06.177 --> 03:08.613
She's the one that got us
into this mess to begin with.

03:08.647 --> 03:11.172
And to a lot of people, she's the
only one who can get us out.

03:11.624 --> 03:14.442
And no small thing, James,

03:14.477 --> 03:16.444
that offering after she preached

03:16.479 --> 03:18.309
was the biggest one we've had all year.

03:20.585 --> 03:22.234
We're going to get through this, Con.

03:22.618 --> 03:23.811
We're going to survive.

03:23.845 --> 03:24.870
Oh, I know,

03:25.254 --> 03:27.055
but you taught me too well.

03:27.089 --> 03:30.025
The Lord doesn't want
his church to survive.

03:30.059 --> 03:31.723
He wants it to thrive.

03:34.390 --> 03:36.498
I did enjoy that singing, though.

03:37.182 --> 03:40.125

04:34.223 --> 04:36.233
How's your Women's Day coming?

04:36.759 --> 04:38.026
Thanks to the men in my life,

04:38.060 --> 04:40.462
it's getting more manageable every day.

04:40.768 --> 04:42.569
Remind me of your theme again?

04:43.076 --> 04:45.305
The virtuous woman.

04:45.339 --> 04:46.965
That's marvelous.

04:48.075 --> 04:50.143
Preach what you know,
that's what I always say.

04:54.282 --> 04:56.666
Are you ever going to treat me
like I'm a human being again?

04:58.412 --> 05:01.621
I didn't want to interrupt
your reading, I'm just asking.

05:01.656 --> 05:03.156
I'm curious, you know?

05:09.463 --> 05:11.665
James, it has been a month.

05:11.699 --> 05:15.035
You still haven't told me what Mac
has on you that's so horrendous.

05:15.069 --> 05:17.170
We've been through this, Mae.
It's all lies.

05:17.204 --> 05:18.705
You want to know why tithes are down.

05:18.739 --> 05:19.469
Why give in to the whispering serpent?

05:19.494 --> 05:21.392
You want to know why people
are leaving your church

05:21.417 --> 05:22.811
like rats from a leaky boat?

05:23.357 --> 05:26.980
Because you are out of right
relationship with God and me.

05:29.016 --> 05:30.116
Preach what you know.

05:30.794 --> 05:31.985
Please.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.575
Kerissa: <i>Biggest problem I see coming,</i>

05:49.609 --> 05:51.376
and I am sorry to bring this up...

05:51.411 --> 05:53.211
Well, the Lord made me for bad news.

05:53.246 --> 05:55.414
I soak it up like a sponge.

05:55.448 --> 05:56.637
<i>Say it.</i>

05:56.671 --> 05:58.083
We're a little under two weeks out,

05:58.117 --> 05:59.084
and it's time to pay the Peabody

05:59.118 --> 06:00.085
the remainder of the ballroom rental.

06:00.119 --> 06:02.081
<i>- Yes?
- Well...</i>

06:02.106 --> 06:05.557
we're currently expecting
just under half the guests

06:05.591 --> 06:06.858
due to all the late cancellations.

06:06.893 --> 06:08.527
And your point is?

06:08.827 --> 06:10.028
I'm wondering if we should just

06:10.063 --> 06:11.546
relocate it to the church.

06:12.265 --> 06:14.699
We have had Women's Day
at the Peabody Hotel

06:14.734 --> 06:17.202
<i>every year for 35 years.</i>

06:17.236 --> 06:19.638
My ladies look forward to it.
It's a tradition.

06:19.672 --> 06:23.241
Well, then somebody needs to get the
deacon board here to sign the check.

06:23.276 --> 06:26.978
Look, I am happy to do whatever
the First Lady wants me to do.

06:27.413 --> 06:29.014
Well, then why haven't
you sent them the money?

06:29.048 --> 06:30.823
Misty: <i>I've been waiting to discuss it.</i>

06:30.857 --> 06:32.656
Kerissa: <i>What's to discuss? Pay it.</i>

06:32.690 --> 06:35.087
Fine. If the Greenleaf family

06:35.121 --> 06:36.655
feels this strongly about it,
and obviously...

06:36.689 --> 06:38.256
How much is it, Misty?

06:38.524 --> 06:39.791
4,500.

06:39.826 --> 06:43.528
Well, I will pay it myself.

06:43.563 --> 06:45.230
No, Mama, let the church pay.

06:45.264 --> 06:46.731
Thanks, dear,

06:47.691 --> 06:49.530
but this is decided.

06:50.136 --> 06:53.205
Everything can't be done by committee.

06:53.239 --> 06:55.540
Lord proved that on the cross.

06:57.664 --> 06:59.932
Who invited that woman to be onboard?

06:59.966 --> 07:02.001
Mama, I have an idea.

07:02.035 --> 07:05.304
Does it involve putting Fred and
Misty Williams in a burlap sack?

07:05.338 --> 07:08.741
I swear I've never seen two people
act so pretty in borrowed clothes.

07:08.775 --> 07:10.793
- Mama.
- Yes, dear?

07:10.827 --> 07:12.244
What if I make a record

07:12.278 --> 07:14.113
and we sell it online
to benefit the church?

07:14.147 --> 07:15.881
My mama has some old sheets
we can use as a curtain.

07:15.915 --> 07:19.018
At least she has an idea.

07:19.658 --> 07:22.321
Do you think I appreciated that
show you put on back there?

07:22.355 --> 07:23.589
Excuse me?

07:23.623 --> 07:24.923
Get me a list of candidates

07:24.958 --> 07:26.258
for this year's scholarships

07:26.292 --> 07:29.361
and make sure nobody on it is under 50.

07:29.396 --> 07:30.596
Yes, ma'am.

07:30.630 --> 07:31.930
So, what do you think, Mama?

07:31.965 --> 07:32.965
Do you really have the energy

07:32.999 --> 07:35.434
to take on a project like that?

07:35.468 --> 07:37.770
<i>Aren't these babies
just wearing you out?</i>

07:37.804 --> 07:38.971
It's only one meeting a month.

07:39.687 --> 07:42.540
- You don't want me on your board.
- Why not?

07:42.574 --> 07:44.910
I was going to have to
tell you today anyway.

07:44.944 --> 07:46.879
We can't host the program anymore.

07:48.581 --> 07:50.529
- Oh.
- Yeah.

07:51.017 --> 07:52.384
Bishop says that we have
to get groups in here

07:52.419 --> 07:54.153
that can actually pay.

07:54.187 --> 07:55.376
I'm sorry.

07:56.256 --> 07:57.823
Once the budget's back on track,

07:57.857 --> 07:58.924
this will be the first thing

07:58.958 --> 08:00.225
I get up and running again.

08:00.260 --> 08:02.628
It's all right. I know times are tough.

08:02.662 --> 08:05.020
Yeah, getting tougher all the time.

08:05.879 --> 08:08.767
Well, I guess
this would be a strange time

08:08.802 --> 08:10.696
for me to invite you to the board,

08:10.730 --> 08:13.058
you know, with us parting ways.

08:13.093 --> 08:15.949
- Yeah.
- But we'd still see each other, right?

08:15.984 --> 08:19.878
I mean, I assume. I hope. Right?

08:19.913 --> 08:22.715
Yeah. Yeah, of course.

08:22.749 --> 08:24.496
You know, just not...

08:25.438 --> 08:26.934
- Yeah, yeah.
- Right.

08:28.388 --> 08:31.390
So, how many weeks we got?

08:31.424 --> 08:34.993
After tomorrow, just one.

08:36.693 --> 08:37.775
All right.

08:38.147 --> 08:40.032
I just need to call my people

08:40.419 --> 08:42.087
and make sure the folks know
to call the hotline.

08:43.203 --> 08:44.703
Yeah, of course.

08:44.738 --> 08:45.871
Do what you got to do.

08:56.716 --> 08:58.602
Can I ask you a Bible question?

08:59.486 --> 09:02.443
Please. This Internet's killing me.

09:02.478 --> 09:05.052
- Ask.
- Okay, so we're reading

09:05.086 --> 09:06.759
this chapter from Mark
for youth group today

09:06.793 --> 09:08.427
about Jesus curing a blind man.

09:08.461 --> 09:09.461
Chapter 8.

09:09.496 --> 09:10.996
Yeah, how do you know that?

09:11.030 --> 09:12.464
Oh, honey, I used to be able to recite

09:12.499 --> 09:13.732
the Gospel of Mark from top to bottom.

09:13.767 --> 09:15.868
- Come on.
- Seriously?

09:15.902 --> 09:19.314
Yeah. What?

09:19.439 --> 09:22.009
Nothing, just now that I know

09:22.044 --> 09:23.467
why you left home and the church,

09:23.501 --> 09:25.244
it hits me sometimes how much you lost.

09:25.792 --> 09:28.092
You were a whole other person.

09:29.020 --> 09:31.231
I was, but I'm glad I left.

09:31.945 --> 09:33.559
If I hadn't, I might never have had you.

09:36.689 --> 09:38.290
What's the question?

09:38.324 --> 09:40.713
Okay, so Jesus touches
the blind man the first time

09:40.747 --> 09:43.095
and asks him if it worked.

09:43.129 --> 09:44.266
And he says...

09:44.291 --> 09:46.560
"I see men, but they look
like trees walking."

09:46.594 --> 09:49.895
Right, but then he touches
the man's eyes again,

09:49.929 --> 09:52.904
and it says, "Then he saw
everything clearly."

09:54.588 --> 09:57.119
Why do that? Why put
something in the Bible

09:57.154 --> 09:59.405
where Jesus has to do something
twice before it works?

09:59.440 --> 10:01.346
Uh...

10:02.819 --> 10:03.885
if at first you don't succeed,

10:03.920 --> 10:05.287
try, try again?

10:08.657 --> 10:09.624
What do you think it's about?

10:10.623 --> 10:11.523
I don't know.

10:14.086 --> 10:16.858
- Hey! - Oh, you guys are so cute.

10:19.041 --> 10:20.440
- I got to go.
- Okay.

10:21.237 --> 10:23.364
I'll find you here after?

10:23.399 --> 10:25.890
If the last four weeks
are any indication,

10:26.294 --> 10:27.230
right here, yeah.

10:28.344 --> 10:29.985
- Later, Aunt Gigi.
- All right, be good.

10:30.894 --> 10:32.679
Can I refresh your coffee, Pastor?

10:32.714 --> 10:34.647
I still got some, but thank you.

10:35.384 --> 10:36.184
May I?

10:36.218 --> 10:37.385
Please.

10:37.728 --> 10:40.890
So, Bishop's really icing you out, huh?

10:43.458 --> 10:45.159
He is, yeah.

10:45.184 --> 10:46.318
I'm not even getting copied

10:46.343 --> 10:47.910
on his daily schedule emails

10:47.935 --> 10:49.035
from Karine anymore.

10:49.231 --> 10:51.699
Doesn't he know you did the right thing?

10:51.734 --> 10:54.182
- Mac had to go to jail.
- He knows.

10:54.217 --> 10:56.033
So, what is it, then?

10:57.806 --> 10:59.540
I didn't do it his way.

10:59.565 --> 11:00.865
Men.

11:01.176 --> 11:02.877
They get old and they get like

11:02.911 --> 11:04.835
those lions in the circus,

11:04.860 --> 11:06.561
raggedy and proud.

11:06.815 --> 11:09.584
The more raggedy, the
more proud, seems like.

11:09.618 --> 11:11.853
- Grace Greenleaf?
- Yeah, that's me.

11:11.887 --> 11:13.321
How can I help you?

11:20.229 --> 11:21.196
What is it?

11:25.060 --> 11:27.161
Ray wants custody of Sophia.

11:36.647 --> 11:39.413
I have to say, I am... I am surprise.

11:39.777 --> 11:40.910
By what?

11:40.945 --> 11:42.272
You fired my client without cause.

11:42.307 --> 11:43.954
I'm not surprised by that.

11:44.304 --> 11:46.877
I'm surprised by...
well, by the way that...

11:46.918 --> 11:48.379
The fact that she was having

11:48.413 --> 11:50.348
a clandestine relationship with your son

11:50.382 --> 11:51.515
was no ground for termination.

11:51.550 --> 11:53.317
Of course it wasn't.

11:53.352 --> 11:55.152
<i>So, what's surprising?</i>

11:57.823 --> 11:59.190
All I meant, Miss Phillips,

11:59.224 --> 12:01.492
is Alexa and I have a...

12:03.295 --> 12:04.962
well, our previous relationship...

12:04.997 --> 12:07.598
Yes? Please, go on.

12:08.860 --> 12:09.666
You're right.

12:10.326 --> 12:11.360
Nothing.

12:13.338 --> 12:15.075
I shouldn't be surprised.

12:15.874 --> 12:18.342
Bishop Greenleaf,
my client is well aware

12:18.377 --> 12:20.211
that both you and your church

12:20.245 --> 12:21.812
have been in the spotlight of late.

12:21.847 --> 12:23.585
<i>We have no desire to drag you back</i>

12:23.619 --> 12:25.194
<i>on the front page over this.</i>

12:25.229 --> 12:26.441
You sure about that?

12:26.466 --> 12:28.919
<i>Oh, we're willing
to do that if we have to.</i>

12:28.954 --> 12:32.726
Our hope is that we can come
to an understanding quickly

12:32.760 --> 12:36.025
and put this painful ugliness behind us.

12:36.050 --> 12:38.369
What kind of understanding
are we talking about here?

12:39.119 --> 12:40.349
A Ford understanding?

12:41.054 --> 12:42.755
Or something more like a Cadillac?

12:44.006 --> 12:45.966
Jaguars are nice.

12:46.893 --> 12:48.827
We're currently in between
lawyers, as you know,

12:48.862 --> 12:51.096
so if you could give us some time?

12:51.131 --> 12:53.666
- End of the week's fine.
- Just what I was thinking.

12:54.555 --> 12:56.669
- Hey, Pop.
- Pastor Greenleaf.

12:56.703 --> 12:59.345
Pat Phillips. Heard so much about you.

12:59.379 --> 13:01.085
Oh, really? Why is that?

13:07.781 --> 13:08.747
Oh, hi.

13:08.782 --> 13:09.748
Hi.

13:10.592 --> 13:11.881
Here's my card.

13:12.552 --> 13:13.986
We look forward to your offer.

13:18.558 --> 13:20.341
Karine said you wanted to see me?

13:20.994 --> 13:23.352
Uh, is she suing us?

13:23.377 --> 13:24.630
Threatening.

13:24.664 --> 13:25.965
What can I do for you, son?

13:25.999 --> 13:28.968
Now may not be a good time.

13:29.002 --> 13:30.769
I ain't no prophet,

13:30.804 --> 13:32.605
but I don't think a good time's

13:32.639 --> 13:34.073
going to be had around
here for quite a awhile.

13:36.543 --> 13:38.978
I appreciate your offer of help, son,

13:39.012 --> 13:40.138
more than you know.

13:40.875 --> 13:42.648
But you still won't reinstate me.

13:42.931 --> 13:44.683
It's not my inclination, no.

13:44.952 --> 13:47.308
But you're not using Gigi for
anything as far as I can see.

13:47.342 --> 13:49.688
Which should be a clue
that my intentions for you

13:49.723 --> 13:52.658
in this time of need
have nothing to do with her.

13:53.437 --> 13:56.822
Now, tell me,
when you were a little boy,

13:57.297 --> 13:59.225
what did you want to be
when you grew up?

13:59.259 --> 14:02.183
A pro baseball player, Pop,
but Gigi left.

14:02.217 --> 14:04.579
Exactly. Then Gigi left.

14:05.271 --> 14:06.639
Now, was that dream worth so little?

14:06.673 --> 14:09.227
Do you honestly believe

14:09.709 --> 14:11.944
that the ministry is where you belong?

14:12.642 --> 14:16.149
What, you want me to go coach
pitchers for the Vols?

14:16.182 --> 14:18.050
No, no, of course not.

14:18.084 --> 14:21.453
But isn't there something
else you would rather do?

14:22.084 --> 14:25.924
Something closer to your
heart and your skill set?

14:26.401 --> 14:27.724
Seize the moment.

14:28.564 --> 14:30.690
Look at me for the sinner that I am

14:31.631 --> 14:34.466
and say, "Old man,
you got yourself into this,

14:35.009 --> 14:36.535
but the Lord has a plan for me,

14:36.569 --> 14:38.451
and I'm getting back to it."

14:39.272 --> 14:41.095
Now, your sister, for better and worse,

14:41.335 --> 14:42.456
has opened a window.

14:42.481 --> 14:43.506
Crawl through it.

14:44.924 --> 14:46.825
Boy, I tell you this because I love you.

14:48.782 --> 14:49.815
Go.

14:54.374 --> 14:55.341
Okay.

15:10.704 --> 15:12.332
Papa, I'm sorry about Alexa.

15:12.872 --> 15:14.239
Water under the bridge...

15:14.274 --> 15:15.768
but pray for her.

15:16.462 --> 15:18.139
She's chosen a painful path.

15:19.012 --> 15:20.179
Come on.

15:23.116 --> 15:24.282
Karine?

15:26.333 --> 15:28.467
I need some flowers delivered tomorrow.

15:28.822 --> 15:31.190
- Where?
- Here.

15:38.431 --> 15:42.501
"Jesus put his hands again
upon the man's eyes

15:42.535 --> 15:44.409
and made him look up,

15:44.871 --> 15:46.448
and he was restored.

15:46.482 --> 15:49.308
And then he saw everything clearly."

15:51.044 --> 15:52.885
So, what's up with that, y'all?

15:54.765 --> 15:57.599
<i>- Sophia?
- Yeah?</i>

15:57.633 --> 15:59.605
In all the time you've been with us,

15:59.639 --> 16:02.777
I don't remember you ever
once raising your hand.

16:03.923 --> 16:06.592
- Because I never have.
- How come?

16:06.626 --> 16:08.761
She was too busy making sure her uncle

16:08.795 --> 16:10.079
didn't reach up her dress.

16:10.113 --> 16:11.063
Shut up about it already.

16:11.097 --> 16:12.690
Quentin, stop being disgusting.

16:12.724 --> 16:13.665
Quentin: <i>Sorry.</i>

16:14.335 --> 16:15.861
Ramona: <i>Why don't you ever talk?</i>

16:17.504 --> 16:19.872
Because I don't know the Bible
as well as everybody else does.

16:19.906 --> 16:21.737
We're all just learning here...

16:22.208 --> 16:23.599
some more than others.

16:24.177 --> 16:25.144
What's your opinion?

16:25.462 --> 16:28.247
Why would Mark tell a story about Jesus

16:28.281 --> 16:30.496
<i>who only got it half right
the first time?</i>

16:32.952 --> 16:34.987
There was something true
about what the man said

16:35.021 --> 16:36.705
he saw the first time, maybe?

16:37.227 --> 16:39.325
How are men like trees walking?

16:42.162 --> 16:43.438
I don't know.

16:43.997 --> 16:48.100
Rooted in something, like trees.

16:48.134 --> 16:52.683
Rooted in friends
or family or God, I guess.

16:55.470 --> 16:57.009
Everyone's rooted,

16:57.043 --> 16:59.518
we just can't see it with our eyes.

17:01.981 --> 17:03.715
I think that'll preach.

17:07.020 --> 17:08.319
Jacob: <i>Hey!</i>

17:13.492 --> 17:14.992
So funny.

17:20.165 --> 17:21.599
Time for a bath.

17:21.634 --> 17:24.036
Thanks.

17:24.069 --> 17:25.085
I'm going to get you when you come back.

17:25.119 --> 17:27.005
So, what do you think? Check it out?

17:27.040 --> 17:28.874
Yeah. It looks like a nice church.

17:28.908 --> 17:29.942
Jacob: <i>It does, doesn't it?</i>

17:29.976 --> 17:31.714
And look at what they
list as qualifications

17:31.748 --> 17:32.845
for senior pastor.

17:32.879 --> 17:35.147
- A godly nature.
- Check.

17:36.482 --> 17:37.650
Lately.

17:37.984 --> 17:40.485
A belief in the authority
of the Scripture.

17:40.520 --> 17:41.587
Come on.

17:41.621 --> 17:43.426
What book's by my bed?

17:44.150 --> 17:45.684
"Debbie Doesn't Do It Anymore."

17:47.260 --> 17:48.160
Under that.

17:49.329 --> 17:50.562
Look, I'm just saying,

17:50.597 --> 17:52.284
seems like they might actually see me

17:52.318 --> 17:54.426
as a viable candidate,

17:55.535 --> 17:57.002
even if my dad doesn't.

17:59.072 --> 18:01.874
Look, we have Fred
and Misty on our side.

18:01.908 --> 18:04.372
It's not going to happen... ever.

18:04.911 --> 18:06.178
So, what am I supposed to do,

18:06.212 --> 18:07.512
just leave Excellence?

18:07.547 --> 18:09.214
Open a new school in Atlanta.

18:09.249 --> 18:11.817
Baby, it took me five
years to open that one.

18:11.851 --> 18:12.951
I'm not starting over.

18:12.986 --> 18:14.551
Then I should go see Basie.

18:17.323 --> 18:18.624
You can't work at Triumph.

18:18.658 --> 18:19.511
Says who?

18:19.545 --> 18:21.159
Your father, for one, I'm sure.

18:21.194 --> 18:22.394
Look, he's cut me loose.

18:22.428 --> 18:24.830
I don't care what he thinks.

18:30.323 --> 18:31.811
Look.

18:33.640 --> 18:36.680
There's no other church
in Memphis big enough,

18:36.715 --> 18:39.211
all right, to pay us what we'd need.

18:39.245 --> 18:41.446
And you just said
you don't want to leave town.

18:41.481 --> 18:45.171
- I know, but...
- But what?

18:46.386 --> 18:47.819
What? What's the problem?

18:53.313 --> 18:54.346
There's no problem.

18:54.488 --> 18:57.162
Go on. Go talk to him.

19:01.501 --> 19:03.144
So, how did you and the dad meet?

19:04.037 --> 19:06.305
I had dinner at his restaurant.

19:06.755 --> 19:08.907
Is he a chef or an owner or...

19:08.942 --> 19:10.845
Both now. Then, he was just a chef.

19:11.744 --> 19:13.045
Were you guys ever married?

19:13.079 --> 19:16.238
No, we broke up right before
I realized I was pregnant.

19:17.243 --> 19:18.209
Can I ask why?

19:18.328 --> 19:20.068
He cheated on me with his ex.

19:20.954 --> 19:22.789
So, you drew up a custody agreement.

19:22.822 --> 19:24.022
I had to.

19:24.057 --> 19:25.123
When he found out I was pregnant,

19:25.158 --> 19:26.543
he was suddenly all like,

19:26.568 --> 19:28.026
"I was wrong. Let's get married."

19:28.061 --> 19:30.128
I didn't want to, so the agreement

19:30.163 --> 19:32.305
was a way to stop that
conversation from continuing.

19:33.002 --> 19:35.100
It is going to be an issue that
you relocated out of state

19:35.134 --> 19:37.336
<i>without getting permission
from the court.</i>

19:39.172 --> 19:40.179
Yeah.

19:42.041 --> 19:43.599
I hadn't planned on staying.

19:43.633 --> 19:47.379
It's... after my sister's
funeral, it was...

19:47.413 --> 19:48.880
I'm so sorry about that.

19:52.151 --> 19:53.155
Thank you.

19:54.087 --> 19:57.956
So, would you say
that Sophia's happy here?

19:57.991 --> 20:01.093
<i>And the only reason
I'm asking is at her age,</i>

20:01.127 --> 20:03.161
<i>her wishes are going to be
taken into consideration</i>

20:03.196 --> 20:04.930
<i>when the judge makes the ruling.</i>

20:05.251 --> 20:06.199
If she had her choice,

20:06.232 --> 20:07.933
I think she'd want to stay here, yeah.

20:09.769 --> 20:10.669
Okay, then.

20:12.790 --> 20:13.824
Okay.

20:17.910 --> 20:19.444
Thank you so much for doing this.

20:19.479 --> 20:20.445
Oh, no problem.

20:20.480 --> 20:21.980
Darlene is a friend,

20:22.015 --> 20:25.283
and now you are, too.

20:25.809 --> 20:27.123
Thank you.

20:57.822 --> 20:59.644
Jacob: Pastor Skanks.

21:00.518 --> 21:01.772
Pastor Greenleaf.

21:02.425 --> 21:04.020
What? The bishop send you over here

21:04.055 --> 21:05.488
to put me in my place?

21:05.523 --> 21:08.525
No, I came on my own.

21:08.559 --> 21:11.227
Why? You looking for a job?

21:15.900 --> 21:17.367
I could be, yeah.

21:19.236 --> 21:23.373
Damn, Darian. I must have the gift.

21:26.903 --> 21:28.243
Give me that thing.

21:31.349 --> 21:32.482
Follow me.

21:39.724 --> 21:41.358
I don't want to live with Dad.

21:41.392 --> 21:42.592
If you don't want to,

21:42.627 --> 21:44.327
chances are you won't have to.

21:44.362 --> 21:45.495
Chances are?

21:45.529 --> 21:46.997
Well, the lawyer told me

21:47.031 --> 21:48.098
that if you don't want to leave,

21:48.132 --> 21:50.734
then chances are really good

21:50.768 --> 21:52.235
that you won't have to.

21:52.269 --> 21:54.237
As long as I stand up in court

21:54.271 --> 21:55.872
and tell Dad to his face I hate him.

21:55.906 --> 21:57.540
No, no, honey, not that you hate him,

21:57.575 --> 21:59.175
just that you want to stay with me.

21:59.210 --> 22:02.379
Sophia.

22:02.413 --> 22:05.181
- I really don't like this.
- I know. I don't either.

22:05.216 --> 22:07.083
But it's your fault.

22:07.118 --> 22:10.153
I haven't done anything wrong.

22:10.187 --> 22:12.822
For you, this is a lesson.
My life just sucks.

22:12.857 --> 22:14.357
It's different.

22:20.264 --> 22:21.164
Whew.

22:22.600 --> 22:25.217
So, what do you want to do, Pastor?

22:26.270 --> 22:28.624
You know, preach, minister, manage.

22:29.306 --> 22:31.241
<i>I can do it all. I've done it all.</i>

22:33.911 --> 22:35.679
- What?
- <i>I'm sorry, man.</i>

22:35.713 --> 22:37.781
This whole thing, you
showing up here like this,

22:37.815 --> 22:39.249
I don't know.

22:39.283 --> 22:41.351
<i>You're the crown prince of Calvary,</i>

22:41.385 --> 22:43.319
the heir apparent to the kingdom.

22:47.158 --> 22:50.968
You know, I'm not, though.

22:51.696 --> 22:53.029
That's the thing.

22:54.398 --> 22:55.665
Because why?

22:55.700 --> 22:57.158
That sister of yours?

22:57.505 --> 22:59.469
Nah, Bishop, I mean, you know,

22:59.503 --> 23:00.704
he just...

23:08.579 --> 23:10.213
<i>The prophet is never without honor,</i>

23:10.247 --> 23:12.849
except in his daddy's eyes.

23:12.883 --> 23:13.883
That's the vibe.

23:13.918 --> 23:15.685
Yeah, I feel you on that one.

23:19.223 --> 23:20.471
Your daddy tough, too?

23:21.905 --> 23:23.817
I never knew my real father,

23:24.595 --> 23:27.673
but the man Jesus sent to test me, Mr.
Skanks,

23:28.699 --> 23:30.133
he tested me good.

23:34.238 --> 23:35.538
Does Bishop know you're here?

23:37.374 --> 23:38.475
No.

23:41.112 --> 23:43.629
All right. Okay, here's the deal.

23:44.782 --> 23:46.917
You know how a big church runs.

23:47.251 --> 23:49.861
- That I do.
- That's valuable, to me, anyway,

23:50.287 --> 23:52.021
because Triumph is about to get bigger.

23:52.056 --> 23:53.223
Much bigger.

23:53.257 --> 23:54.891
So, I showed up at the right time.

23:54.925 --> 23:56.326
Could be, but I can't hire you

23:56.360 --> 23:58.128
without the bishop's say-so.

23:58.162 --> 23:59.988
That's not how I do things,
in bad blood.

24:00.013 --> 24:02.575
But if you could set up
a meeting between me,

24:02.600 --> 24:04.834
the bishop, and yourself to, you know,

24:05.260 --> 24:08.015
discuss this openly like men,

24:09.273 --> 24:10.373
we could work something out.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.214
- I'll give it a shot.
- <i>Let me know.</i>

24:22.546 --> 24:23.446
Pastor?

24:25.256 --> 24:26.222
You're not just coming over here

24:26.257 --> 24:27.757
for that white girl, are you?

24:28.781 --> 24:29.727
What white girl?

24:30.167 --> 24:31.694
Alexa.

24:31.729 --> 24:33.396
<i>She's a member.</i>

24:33.430 --> 24:37.167
I know you two had an... irregularity.

24:38.536 --> 24:41.237
Oh, uh, no.

24:42.475 --> 24:43.619
Cool.

24:52.082 --> 24:54.384
- Hey, baby.
- Hey! Baby!

24:54.418 --> 24:56.686
- Hey, give me those.
- That's okay.

24:56.720 --> 24:58.288
Well, what are y'all doing?

24:58.322 --> 25:00.190
We're making a pad
for those angels of yours

25:00.224 --> 25:01.624
to crash-land on, Daddy.

25:01.659 --> 25:02.892
Can I help?

25:02.927 --> 25:04.394
Charity: No, I think we got it.

25:04.428 --> 25:05.829
<i>Did that crib say it came with tools</i>

25:05.863 --> 25:07.463
<i>or do I need to go find some?</i>

25:07.498 --> 25:08.464
Carlton: <i>I think that
funky little string bean</i>

25:08.499 --> 25:10.633
<i>said it comes with a wrench.</i>

25:10.668 --> 25:12.202
Wanda: <i>Yeah, she said one's in there</i>

25:12.236 --> 25:14.037
<i>in between sipping on that juice box.</i>

25:14.071 --> 25:15.405
Charity: <i>Well, good,
because I wouldn't know</i>

25:15.439 --> 25:16.506
<i>the first place to look for one here.</i>

25:16.540 --> 25:17.790
Carlton: <i>Right?</i>

25:17.815 --> 25:19.342
I just feel bad for her.

25:21.278 --> 25:23.346
Because she's not wrong,
it is all my fault.

25:25.716 --> 25:26.683
If I'd just bitten the bullet

25:26.717 --> 25:28.671
and explained it all to Ray...

25:30.487 --> 25:31.521
who knows?

25:33.891 --> 25:35.091
Maybe I was wrong.

25:35.125 --> 25:36.125
Maybe he would have said, "Take her."

25:36.773 --> 25:38.040
God, it didn't feel that way.

25:44.268 --> 25:46.102
I'm sorry to ruin your night.

25:46.136 --> 25:48.338
No, you're not ruining anything.

25:48.372 --> 25:50.106
Really?

25:50.140 --> 25:52.475
It just sounds hard, that's all.

25:52.509 --> 25:53.509
Yeah.

25:58.415 --> 26:00.183
I wish I had something more to offer you

26:00.217 --> 26:03.381
than this broken-up life.

26:03.841 --> 26:04.968
It's okay.

26:06.290 --> 26:07.988
I don't want anything else from you.

26:08.880 --> 26:10.360
You don't?

26:12.229 --> 26:15.231
I just... I mean, look,

26:15.616 --> 26:18.468
whatever it is, whatever you are,

26:19.672 --> 26:21.185
that's all I want.

26:22.585 --> 26:24.375
I don't want anything else.

27:02.492 --> 27:04.526
I should get you some more wine.

27:06.083 --> 27:07.517
I should go.

27:15.492 --> 27:16.823
I'll go get your coat.

27:16.825 --> 27:41.816
♪

27:46.989 --> 27:48.156
Karine?

27:50.492 --> 27:51.693
Karine?

27:54.063 --> 27:57.553
- Karine!
- Uh-huh?

27:57.893 --> 27:59.600
Who sent these flowers?

27:59.976 --> 28:01.200
The bishop.

28:02.536 --> 28:05.656
<i>He said it was your 44th
wedding anniversary today.</i>

28:07.214 --> 28:08.348
Did he get the date wrong?

28:09.824 --> 28:11.447
No, he didn't.

28:11.480 --> 28:12.547
You can go.

28:33.502 --> 28:35.084
Please.

28:39.475 --> 28:42.243
Hey, good news.

28:44.013 --> 28:46.481
- Yeah?
- You look exhausted.

28:48.050 --> 28:51.117
Yeah. What's the news?

28:51.687 --> 28:52.954
Found another church.

28:52.988 --> 28:53.981
It's all set up for next week,

28:54.006 --> 28:56.522
so this will be our last morning.

28:57.726 --> 29:00.403
Yeah, when one door closes, right?

29:00.438 --> 29:02.230
This time, anyway.

29:02.264 --> 29:03.798
Yeah.

29:04.564 --> 29:07.235
You okay?

29:07.269 --> 29:09.529
Yeah.

29:10.072 --> 29:12.431
Just tired, that's all.

29:13.354 --> 29:15.152
They ever let you out of here?

29:16.512 --> 29:18.726
And ever since then,
it's been the couch.

29:19.515 --> 29:20.809
And how long ago was that?

29:21.377 --> 29:22.610
A month.

29:23.567 --> 29:25.723
And all this over a phone?

29:26.492 --> 29:28.189
Yeah,

29:28.223 --> 29:30.789
and whatever she thinks I'm doing on it.

29:31.560 --> 29:34.328
What are you doing on it, if I can ask?

29:36.165 --> 29:37.011
Just...

29:38.389 --> 29:40.001
looking at stuff.

29:43.582 --> 29:45.773
- Have you ever cheated?
- No.

29:47.309 --> 29:48.276
And I don't want to.

29:48.310 --> 29:49.637
That's the whole problem.

29:51.335 --> 29:52.780
When I was a kid,

29:53.373 --> 29:55.251
my father would take a walk
every night after dinner.

29:57.532 --> 29:59.256
We were never sure
he was going to come back.

30:02.891 --> 30:04.674
One night, he just didn't.

30:09.327 --> 30:11.428
I always swore I'd never be that guy.

30:13.782 --> 30:15.116
You're not.

30:22.144 --> 30:23.287
Yeah.

30:25.481 --> 30:26.981
Not yet, anyway.

30:31.153 --> 30:32.533
Um...

30:36.525 --> 30:37.892
I should get back to work.

30:50.672 --> 30:52.907
- Basie Skanks?
- Yes, sir.

30:56.245 --> 31:00.014
It was his idea that we gather
to discuss your future?

31:00.379 --> 31:02.488
Yes, sir. He said he doesn't want

31:02.523 --> 31:03.888
to do anything behind your back.

31:03.923 --> 31:05.753
Then he's got a lot
to teach you, doesn't he?

31:06.587 --> 31:09.158
Fine. Set it.

31:11.393 --> 31:12.827
Pop, you don't want me here.

31:12.861 --> 31:14.162
I said, set it.

31:20.002 --> 31:24.205
Melisse, it came to my
attention that you had applied

31:24.239 --> 31:26.040
for one of the Women's Day scholarships

31:26.074 --> 31:28.843
- for nursing school.
- Yes, ma'am.

31:31.046 --> 31:32.914
Well, I wanted you to know in person

31:32.948 --> 31:34.882
that you'd be receiving
that scholarship.

31:37.219 --> 31:39.387
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

31:42.291 --> 31:47.328
I feel like your behavior
recently has been a cry for help,

31:47.362 --> 31:50.711
<i>and I was at a loss at how to respond,</i>

31:50.745 --> 31:53.901
but you showed me with this application.

31:54.665 --> 31:58.157
What behavior? I'm sorry, I don't...

31:58.219 --> 31:59.086
When you talked to the paper.

32:03.813 --> 32:05.379
I didn't say anything, ma'am.

32:05.414 --> 32:07.014
No.

32:07.049 --> 32:09.884
I understand from my conversation

32:09.918 --> 32:11.858
with the journalist in question

32:12.827 --> 32:14.168
that you didn't have to.

32:17.926 --> 32:21.362
But, honestly, it sounds so confusing,

32:21.396 --> 32:25.333
I'm sure I would've behaved
in a similar manner.

32:26.574 --> 32:28.036
I'm so sorry, ma'am.

32:28.070 --> 32:29.485
Oh, don't be.

32:30.939 --> 32:32.940
All things work together for good

32:32.975 --> 32:34.620
for those who love the Lord.

32:34.655 --> 32:36.526
<i>That's what the Bible says.</i>

32:36.615 --> 32:38.064
So...

32:40.514 --> 32:42.482
here's a check to get you
through the summer.

32:42.780 --> 32:45.286
<i>The tuition you'll get at the ceremony.</i>

32:45.320 --> 32:47.455
The first year, anyway.

32:47.815 --> 32:49.316
The rest as we go.

32:51.014 --> 32:54.328
Are you saying you don't need
me at the house anymore?

32:55.142 --> 32:56.998
Take some time, dear.

32:57.032 --> 32:59.079
You have a long road ahead.

33:02.984 --> 33:04.017
Come in.

33:08.689 --> 33:10.640
Oh, I didn't know it was you.

33:10.675 --> 33:12.192
Can we talk?

33:13.961 --> 33:14.894
What is there to say?

33:18.966 --> 33:20.133
I'm sorry.

33:20.769 --> 33:21.968
About what?

33:24.272 --> 33:26.807
You can't even think of something
to be sorry for, can you?

33:26.841 --> 33:28.875
Because you don't think
you did anything wrong.

33:29.903 --> 33:32.160
What did I do that was so wrong?

33:33.748 --> 33:36.583
Gigi, all I asked you for was some time.

33:37.271 --> 33:39.336
I didn't ask you
to let your uncle go free.

33:39.821 --> 33:41.455
I didn't ask you to keep quiet.

33:41.489 --> 33:43.457
<i>I only asked you for some time</i>

33:43.491 --> 33:44.753
<i>to set some things in order.</i>

33:44.787 --> 33:48.195
- What things?
- That's none of your concern.

33:50.865 --> 33:53.200
All I asked you for was some time,

33:53.692 --> 33:55.836
and you went speeding on ahead

33:55.870 --> 33:57.834
without a thought to the cost to me.

33:59.234 --> 34:02.776
<i>As a result, some things that
could have been merely scandalous</i>

34:02.810 --> 34:04.162
<i>are now calamitous.</i>

34:05.659 --> 34:08.014
And the bond of love that we have shared

34:08.049 --> 34:10.043
ever since the day you were born

34:10.585 --> 34:12.252
is now so badly frayed,

34:12.286 --> 34:14.788
<i>I don't know how
it will ever come together.</i>

34:22.529 --> 34:23.964
Then that's why I'm sorry.

34:23.998 --> 34:25.150
No!

34:25.893 --> 34:27.460
That's why you're sad.

34:30.367 --> 34:31.905
Do you think it's a coincidence

34:31.938 --> 34:35.159
that Sophia's father
comes around at this time?

34:36.210 --> 34:39.975
Don't you feel the Lord's
instructive hand at work here?

34:45.426 --> 34:48.367
You know what? You were right.

34:48.741 --> 34:50.454
About what?

Bishop: <i>Mae?</i>

37:01.422 --> 37:02.489
Mae?

37:24.845 --> 37:25.750
Hello?

37:26.347 --> 37:27.847
Woman's voice: <i>Hello.</i>

37:27.882 --> 37:29.516
<i>You are receiving a call from an inmate</i>

37:29.550 --> 37:31.685
<i>in a Tennessee correctional facility.</i>

37:31.719 --> 37:33.254
Mac, on recording: <i>Robert McCready.</i>

37:33.721 --> 37:35.905
Woman: <i>Do you accept the charges?</i>

37:36.857 --> 37:37.824
Yes.

37:38.696 --> 37:40.061
Mac: <i>James?</i>

37:41.662 --> 37:43.030
What do you want?

37:44.532 --> 37:45.884
Mac, I'm hanging up this phone.

37:45.918 --> 37:47.967
Wait, please. Just wait.

37:50.638 --> 37:52.010
<i>What is it?</i>

37:53.240 --> 37:54.933
Do you think there's a Hell?

37:56.143 --> 37:57.477
<i>A Hell?</i>

37:57.511 --> 37:58.678
What are you doing calling me

37:58.713 --> 38:00.213
with a question like that?

38:01.199 --> 38:02.982
You're the only one I trust.

38:05.052 --> 38:08.756
Do you really think there's a Hell?

38:09.390 --> 38:11.558
Someplace where people get punished

38:11.592 --> 38:12.959
<i>for all eternity?</i>

38:17.364 --> 38:19.475
I've never been much for this...

38:20.528 --> 38:21.828
God of punishment.

38:23.370 --> 38:24.871
I know the Bible says it's a fact,

38:24.905 --> 38:29.712
but I've never seen
any evidence of it myself.

38:31.301 --> 38:33.246
<i>Most sin, to me,</i>

38:33.280 --> 38:35.682
<i>seems like it brings its own
suitcase of pain with it</i>

38:35.716 --> 38:37.540
<i>when it walks in the door.</i>

38:38.319 --> 38:39.631
<i>That being said...</i>

38:42.001 --> 38:44.073
I think when we die, Mac...

38:46.360 --> 38:48.361
we go immediately and completely

38:48.395 --> 38:51.331
into the presence
of the pure love of God.

38:52.530 --> 38:54.177
<i>And for some of us,</i>

38:55.035 --> 38:56.603
<i>depending on what we've done,</i>

38:57.649 --> 39:01.741
<i>to discern in that moment
how much damage we did,</i>

39:01.776 --> 39:04.501
<i>how good it all
could have been otherwise...</i>

39:06.847 --> 39:08.681
that's going to feel like Hell.

39:13.320 --> 39:15.032
Is there any way out?

<i>There's always a way out, you know that.</i>

39:20.180 --> 39:21.551
You just have to confess.

39:25.166 --> 39:26.132
Thank you.

39:42.589 --> 39:43.780
What are you doing out here, honey?

39:46.072 --> 39:47.153
Nothing.

39:47.188 --> 39:53.159
Just trying to remember
all this for later,

39:53.194 --> 39:54.661
if I have to leave.

39:58.479 --> 40:00.133
It's all going to work out.

40:02.956 --> 40:04.089
You don't know that.

40:08.468 --> 40:09.687
You're right, I don't.

40:11.245 --> 40:12.212
But I'm going to do my very best

40:12.246 --> 40:14.414
to make sure you get to stay...

40:15.729 --> 40:17.124
if you want.

40:17.952 --> 40:19.776
Yeah, I do.

40:20.504 --> 40:22.008
That's the thing.

40:24.393 --> 40:28.337
I know it's not perfect
here, obviously, but...

40:30.424 --> 40:32.347
this is the first place in my life

40:32.382 --> 40:34.834
that's ever felt like a home.

40:42.515 --> 40:47.840
I mean, like, listen to that.

40:50.551 --> 40:54.587
What?

40:55.355 --> 40:56.956
The quiet.

40:58.959 --> 41:00.793
It's so loud.
