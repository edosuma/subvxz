00:00.909 --> 00:03.909
Tonight on
The Curse of Oak Island

00:03.909 --> 00:06.060
Here are the stones
of Nolan’s Cross.

00:06.060 --> 00:07.759
-They intersect
at this location.

00:07.759 --> 00:08.760
-MARTY: Wow.

00:08.760 --> 00:09.760
X marks the spot.

00:09.760 --> 00:11.090
DANNY:
Yeah! That’s what

00:11.090 --> 00:12.250
we’re looking for!

00:12.250 --> 00:13.809
RICK:
We’re on something.

00:13.809 --> 00:14.809
That is massive.

00:14.809 --> 00:17.150
-GARY: Whoa! Look at that.
-JACK: What?

00:17.150 --> 00:18.869
-That’s a lock.
-It is.

00:18.869 --> 00:21.250
That looks like it’s off
a treasure chest.

00:21.250 --> 00:23.480
-CRAIG: That does not look good.
-MARTY: Nothing’s running.

00:23.480 --> 00:25.199
-RICK: Hammer grab’s down.
-We’re in trouble.

00:25.199 --> 00:26.619
JARDINE:
Very disappointing for me.

00:26.619 --> 00:29.750
We got the word this morning
that we’re on strike.

00:29.750 --> 00:33.050
NARRATOR:
There is an island

00:33.050 --> 00:35.210
in the North Atlantic

00:35.210 --> 00:38.079
where people have been looking
for an incredible treasure

00:38.079 --> 00:41.489
for more than 200 years.

00:41.489 --> 00:44.829
So far, they have found
a stone slab

00:44.829 --> 00:47.670
with strange symbols carved
into it,

00:47.670 --> 00:50.739
mysterious fragments
of human bone,

00:50.739 --> 00:54.469
and a lead cross whose origin
may stretch back

00:54.469 --> 00:56.710
to the days
of the Knights Templar.

00:56.710 --> 01:02.460
To date, six men have died
trying to solve the mystery.

01:02.460 --> 01:04.180
And, according to legend,

01:04.180 --> 01:06.460
one more will have to die

01:06.460 --> 01:11.260
before the treasure
can be found.

As a new day begins

01:37.800 --> 01:38.970
on Oak Island...

01:39.370 --> 01:41.370
DOUG:
I see a piece of timber there.

01:41.370 --> 01:44.040
Let’s have a look at that
before he takes it away.

01:44.040 --> 01:47.310
...local historians,
Paul Troutman and Doug Crowell,

01:47.310 --> 01:49.580
along with geologist
Terry Matheson,

01:49.580 --> 01:53.020
are monitoring the excavation
of the 60-inch-wide borehole

01:53.020 --> 01:54.590
known as GG-1.

01:54.590 --> 01:56.840
DOUG:
It looks like

01:56.840 --> 01:58.010
an older timber to me.

01:58.010 --> 01:59.540
Oh, she’s well over six-inch.

01:59.540 --> 02:01.520
NARRATOR:
It is this borehole

02:01.520 --> 02:04.270
that the team believes could
get them within a few feet

02:04.270 --> 02:06.660
of the original
Money Pit treasure shaft,

02:06.660 --> 02:08.449
first discovered in 1795.

02:08.449 --> 02:12.040
TERRY:
Old chunk of timber.

02:12.040 --> 02:14.740
PAUL:
Yeah, you got a little notch

02:14.740 --> 02:16.050
right in here.

02:16.050 --> 02:18.660
Break at the top,
break at the bottom.

02:18.660 --> 02:21.060
Notch right on the side.

02:21.060 --> 02:24.050
TERRY:
Yesterday, we didn’t see,

02:24.050 --> 02:25.350
uh, we didn’t see any changes.

02:25.350 --> 02:28.300
Just saw a lot of debris
and, uh, little wood splinters

02:28.300 --> 02:31.960
-and twigs and this and that.
-Yeah.

02:31.960 --> 02:35.280
-That looked different.
-Where are we at now?

02:35.280 --> 02:36.350
JARDINE:
The hole was at 90, 91 feet.

02:36.350 --> 02:39.230
So we’ll be pushing 100 feet
right there now with the can.

02:39.230 --> 02:40.610
PAUL:
We should be in the target area

02:40.610 --> 02:42.600
between 100, 150 or so.

02:42.600 --> 02:45.810
So hoping to see
some more timbers

02:45.910 --> 02:47.190
-as we, as we come
into it, so...

02:47.190 --> 02:48.190
-Yeah.

02:48.890 --> 02:49.590
DOUG:
Something like that

02:49.590 --> 02:50.290
could be, uh,

02:50.290 --> 02:50.990
supporting the top of a tunnel.

02:51.090 --> 02:52.590
RICK:
There’s no question about that.

02:52.590 --> 02:53.590
NARRATOR:
Two weeks ago,

02:53.590 --> 02:57.760
while excavating a 60-inch-wide
borehole known as S-6,

02:58.460 --> 03:01.540
some six feet
southwest of GG-1,

03:01.840 --> 03:04.760
the Oak Island team penetrated
what they believed

03:04.760 --> 03:07.210
to be the infamous Shaft Six,

03:07.210 --> 03:11.300
the searcher tunnel that was
originally dug back in 1861

03:11.300 --> 03:14.650
as a kind of back door into
the original treasure vault.

03:14.650 --> 03:17.990
It was while searching
through the S-6 spoils

03:17.990 --> 03:22.000
that the Oak Island team made
a number of exciting finds,

03:22.000 --> 03:24.500
including bits
of leather bookbinding,

03:24.500 --> 03:28.430
stoneware pottery dating back
to the early 1700s

03:28.430 --> 03:31.150
and a hand-hewn oak timber,
similar to those

03:31.150 --> 03:35.010
reportedly found
in the original Money Pit.

03:35.010 --> 03:37.340
These finds convinced them
that not only

03:37.340 --> 03:39.650
might they have
finally found Shaft Six,

03:39.650 --> 03:41.540
but they could be
closer than ever

03:41.540 --> 03:43.959
to finding the original
Money Pit treasure vault,

03:43.959 --> 03:46.710
and, thus,
solving the Oak Island mystery.

03:46.710 --> 03:48.950
RICK:
Based on these maps,

03:48.950 --> 03:51.990
the Money Pit is up
in this northwest quadrant.

03:51.990 --> 03:55.710
I have high hopes and high
anticipation. I think that

03:55.710 --> 03:58.870
we’re on the cusp
of possibly finding

03:58.870 --> 04:00.750
the one thing in the Money Pit.

04:06.350 --> 04:07.500
DOUG:
Hey, Rick.

04:07.500 --> 04:08.650
RICK:
Hey, guys.

04:09.250 --> 04:11.459
DOUG:
We’ll let Danny fill you in

04:11.459 --> 04:14.459
-on what’s been going on.
-DANNY: All right.

04:14.459 --> 04:16.572
We have 111 feet
of casing in the ground.

04:16.572 --> 04:20.089
And the oscillator pressure
is the highest it’s been

04:20.089 --> 04:23.750
since we’ve last year to this
year, we’re breaking records.

04:23.750 --> 04:28.320
We’re flirting
with 210 bar right now.

04:28.320 --> 04:29.630
What do you, what do you make
of that, though?

04:29.630 --> 04:32.960
The real enigma is what are
we biting into that’s creating

04:32.960 --> 04:34.510
those high torque pressures
on the oscillator?

04:34.510 --> 04:36.490
RICK:
We’re all hoping for something

04:36.490 --> 04:37.810
significant here, but I...

04:37.810 --> 04:41.910
you know, we got to let
the facts tell the story.

04:41.910 --> 04:43.470
NARRATOR:
News that the massive

04:43.470 --> 04:45.160
oscillator is circulating

04:45.160 --> 04:48.819
at a torque pressure
of nearly 210 bar,

04:48.819 --> 04:51.600
over double its normal
operating pressure,

04:51.600 --> 04:54.050
is a potentially
significant development.

04:54.050 --> 04:58.040
It indicates that
the 60-inch-wide steel caisson

04:58.040 --> 05:00.680
is now drilling into
an extremely hard object

05:00.680 --> 05:04.340
some 111 feet deep underground.

05:04.340 --> 05:08.720
The question now becomes
whether the object is natural

05:08.720 --> 05:10.110
or man-made.

05:10.110 --> 05:12.900
PAUL:
Interesting thing is

05:12.900 --> 05:14.490
we’re getting an assortment,

05:14.490 --> 05:16.070
just like we did last time,

05:16.070 --> 05:21.060
of many different types
of woods and shafts.

05:21.060 --> 05:23.960
RICK:
That looks like oak.

05:23.960 --> 05:24.960
It does, doesn’t it?

05:24.960 --> 05:25.960
That’s what you’d think
in the Money Pit.

05:25.960 --> 05:28.810
TERRY:
A lot of oak in and around here.

05:28.810 --> 05:30.560
Can we see the cuts?

05:30.560 --> 05:33.130
There’s an indication
of a saw direction.

05:33.130 --> 05:35.450
See that?

05:35.450 --> 05:37.630
Seems even more of a vertical
than a circular saw.

05:37.630 --> 05:39.520
NARRATOR:
Oak timbers?

05:39.520 --> 05:45.160
Found at a depth of 111 feet?

05:45.160 --> 05:46.669
As searchers began excavating

05:46.669 --> 05:49.900
the original Money Pit
more than two centuries ago,

05:49.900 --> 05:51.919
they reported finding the first

05:51.919 --> 05:55.000
of what would eventually be
nine oak platforms,

05:55.000 --> 05:58.490
each ten feet deeper
than the last.

05:58.490 --> 06:01.510
Could these oak timbers found
in the spoils of GG-1

06:01.510 --> 06:04.540
be evidence that the team has
finally found

06:04.540 --> 06:07.310
the original Money Pit
treasure shaft?

06:07.310 --> 06:10.090
PAUL:
So, the question is,

06:10.090 --> 06:11.440
with all this wood coming up,

06:11.440 --> 06:13.260
do you want to put
another can on?

06:13.260 --> 06:15.390
-Keep going? Okay.
-Oh, yeah. We have to.

06:15.390 --> 06:17.590
Yeah, we got
to continue going on.

06:17.590 --> 06:19.120
Well, you can’t can’t stop now,

06:19.120 --> 06:21.530
you got to figure out
what’s going on.

06:25.730 --> 06:27.290
NARRATOR:
As the excavation

06:27.290 --> 06:29.070
of borehole GG-1 continues...

06:29.070 --> 06:31.880
Ooh! Wow,
it’s cold out here, Gary.

06:31.880 --> 06:34.260
-Wait, hang on, mate.
Let’s put the seats down.

06:34.260 --> 06:35.260
-Oh.

06:35.260 --> 06:36.260
NARRATOR:
...Jack Begley

06:36.260 --> 06:37.260
and metal detection expert

06:37.260 --> 06:38.260
Gary Drayton...

06:38.260 --> 06:39.330
GARY:
This clips on here.

06:39.330 --> 06:43.770
...are heading to the western
side of the island, to Lot 25.

06:43.770 --> 06:47.860
It is one of nine
four-acre lots on the island

06:47.860 --> 06:52.000
once owned by the former
American slave Samuel Ball.

06:52.000 --> 06:55.310
-JACK: Right here?
-GARY: Here’s good.

06:55.310 --> 06:56.380
-JACK: This good?
-Yeah.

06:56.380 --> 06:57.380
Ooh!

07:00.480 --> 07:02.639
Where do you want to start?

07:02.639 --> 07:04.060
GARY:
The edge of the lot.

07:04.060 --> 07:06.770
-The other side of the wall.
-Okay.

07:06.770 --> 07:09.100
NARRATOR:
In light of the recent

07:09.100 --> 07:10.449
and significant finds

07:10.449 --> 07:13.560
made on the western side
of the island,

07:13.560 --> 07:16.990
such as the lead fragments that
have been scientifically proven

07:16.990 --> 07:18.870
to be associated
with the medieval cross

07:18.870 --> 07:22.160
found last year
at Smith’s Cove,

07:22.160 --> 07:24.889
the team is hoping
that this side of the island,

07:24.889 --> 07:27.680
and perhaps Samuel Ball’s
former property,

07:27.680 --> 07:30.110
will reveal more clues
that could help solve

07:30.110 --> 07:33.180
the 223-year-old
treasure mystery.

07:33.180 --> 07:35.280
GARY:
All right,

07:35.280 --> 07:39.660
so we’ll see what we can find.

07:39.660 --> 07:41.330
(beeping)

07:41.330 --> 07:44.990
I’ve been all over Oak Island,

07:44.990 --> 07:48.830
but these lots have always been
too thick to get in.

07:48.830 --> 07:53.229
But now they’re cleared,
there’s more ground opened up,

07:53.229 --> 07:56.310
and we’ve been finding
some good stuff.

07:56.310 --> 07:57.550
(beeping)

07:57.550 --> 08:02.520
Wow, that sounds good.

08:02.520 --> 08:05.700
This is iron,
but definitely worth a go at.

08:11.000 --> 08:12.230
Good digging.

08:12.730 --> 08:14.389
JACK:
Now it’s gone?

08:14.889 --> 08:16.989
Should be out.

08:20.789 --> 08:22.889
-Whoa! Look at that.
-What?

08:22.889 --> 08:27.210
What - I have no idea
what that is, Gary.

08:27.210 --> 08:28.490
That is a lock.

08:28.490 --> 08:30.699
An old one, by the look of it.

08:30.699 --> 08:32.870
-Look at that.
-JACK: Oh, it is.

08:32.870 --> 08:33.870
See those nails.

08:33.870 --> 08:35.470
-Look at that old nail
in there still.

08:35.470 --> 08:36.770
-JACK: Holy...

08:36.770 --> 08:38.359
GARY:
That is a lock plate.

08:38.458 --> 08:41.490
I mean, this would have been
on a box or a chest.

08:41.490 --> 08:43.289
Oh, definitely. I know!

08:43.289 --> 08:44.809
That’s amazing, Gary.

08:44.809 --> 08:47.730
GARY:
This looks like an oldie to me.

08:47.730 --> 08:50.490
-Oh, look, you can see
the keyhole. Look.

08:50.490 --> 08:51.490
-JACK: Yeah.

08:51.490 --> 08:53.189
NARRATOR:
A lock plate,

08:53.189 --> 08:54.940
from a possible chest?

08:54.940 --> 08:55.940
This is a good sign.

08:55.940 --> 08:57.329
NARRATOR:
Could it be from a chest

08:57.329 --> 08:59.660
once owned by Samuel Ball?

08:59.660 --> 09:01.699
Or could it be
from one belonging

09:01.699 --> 09:03.110
to his former neighbor,

09:03.110 --> 09:06.619
the 18th century privateer
Captain James Anderson?

09:06.619 --> 09:09.329
It makes you wonder
what was going on here.

09:09.329 --> 09:10.899
NARRATOR:
Reportedly born

09:10.899 --> 09:12.290
in Baltimore, Maryland,

09:12.290 --> 09:14.750
Captain James Anderson
pledged his loyalty

09:14.750 --> 09:16.490
to the United States

09:16.490 --> 09:20.869
during the American Revolution
in the late 1700s.

09:20.869 --> 09:24.920
However, after being
given command of a ship,

09:24.920 --> 09:28.680
known as the Betsy, Anderson
defected to the British.

09:28.680 --> 09:32.290
Although he was charged
with treason and piracy

09:32.290 --> 09:35.629
by then governor of Virginia
and future American president

09:35.629 --> 09:39.129
Thomas Jefferson,
Anderson escaped to Canada,

09:39.129 --> 09:43.410
where he purchased Lot 26
on Oak Island and lived there

09:43.410 --> 09:46.939
until he sold the property
to Samuel Ball in 1788.

09:46.939 --> 09:49.480
-Hey, Steve?
-Yes.

09:49.480 --> 09:51.540
NARRATOR:
Just last year,

09:51.540 --> 09:53.980
members of the team
visited the nearby home

09:53.980 --> 09:58.040
of James Anderson’s direct
descendent, Steve Atkinson.

09:58.040 --> 10:03.730
There, Steve showed them one
of Anderson’s own sea chests,

10:03.730 --> 10:06.019
as well as a mysterious set
of keys.

10:06.019 --> 10:07.579
STEVE A.:
That one opens

10:07.579 --> 10:09.040
that treasure chest.

10:09.040 --> 10:11.209
Could there have been more
treasure chests on the island?

10:11.209 --> 10:14.290
That’s what I wonder.

10:14.290 --> 10:16.079
NARRATOR:
Could this lock plate

10:16.079 --> 10:17.209
be from a chest

10:17.209 --> 10:19.749
that once belonged
to Captain James Anderson?

10:19.749 --> 10:21.420
JACK:
Samuel Ball got rich

10:21.420 --> 10:22.420
for a reason,

10:22.420 --> 10:25.329
and if he was wealthy,
he had something worth hiding.

10:25.329 --> 10:28.240
GARY:
Ah, we’re cashing in.

10:32.740 --> 10:33.569
DANNY:
Yeah! That’s what

10:33.569 --> 10:34.880
we’re looking for! big p.

10:35.280 --> 10:37.140
NARRATOR:
At the Money Pit...

10:37.240 --> 10:39.820
-Gentlemen.
-Hey, Craig. How you doing?

10:39.920 --> 10:42.249
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina, Craig Tester

10:42.249 --> 10:43.249
and other members

10:43.249 --> 10:46.769
of the Oak Island team eagerly
monitor the excavation

10:46.769 --> 10:48.100
of borehole GG-1,

10:48.100 --> 10:51.410
a borehole which they believe
may have intersected

10:51.410 --> 10:53.350
with the original Money Pit
treasure shaft.

10:53.350 --> 10:54.910
CRAIG:
What are we finding?

10:54.910 --> 10:56.430
PAUL:
Just a mix of everything.

10:56.430 --> 10:57.649
CRAIG:
How long have you been

10:57.649 --> 10:59.519
going through this wood?

10:59.519 --> 11:02.569
Uh, about over ten feet.

11:02.569 --> 11:03.909
-Yeah.
-Okay.

11:03.909 --> 11:06.400
-Uh, let ’em dump this.
-Yeah.

11:13.600 --> 11:16.240
(horn honking)

11:16.240 --> 11:18.219
JARDINE:
Oh, wow. What’s that?

11:18.219 --> 11:19.899
PAUL:
Is that wood?

11:22.099 --> 11:23.799
DANNY:
Yeah!

11:23.799 --> 11:24.799
JARDINE:
Oh, wow.

11:24.799 --> 11:26.830
DANNY:
That’s what we’re looking for!

11:29.230 --> 11:30.030
Whoa!

11:30.130 --> 11:31.530
Nice section right there.

11:32.230 --> 11:33.510
That is large.

11:33.510 --> 11:36.470
DOUG:
And I don’t think we have

11:36.470 --> 11:38.069
the full width of it there.

11:38.069 --> 11:39.239
I think it split.

11:39.239 --> 11:40.989
Want to try knocking it off?

11:40.989 --> 11:41.989
RICK:
Let Danny just

11:41.989 --> 11:44.149
put the bucket on it.

11:44.149 --> 11:51.299
That is one big piece.

11:51.299 --> 11:54.389
Give it a try here?
(grunting)

11:54.389 --> 11:57.249
Ooh, yeah.

11:59.649 --> 12:00.440
There we go.

12:10.440 --> 12:11.470
Five-foot.

12:11.770 --> 12:14.209
CRAIG:
That’s an awful massive beam.

12:14.209 --> 12:15.729
TERRY:
That’s a big ol’ chunk of tree.

12:15.729 --> 12:17.209
CRAIG:
What kind of depth we at?

12:17.409 --> 12:20.799
One... 115 with the teeth,

12:20.899 --> 12:23.679
maybe 113 with the excavation.

12:23.679 --> 12:26.999
NARRATOR:
A five-foot wooden beam

12:26.999 --> 12:29.160
found at a depth of 113 feet?

12:29.160 --> 12:32.369
RICK:
Can you imagine getting that

12:32.369 --> 12:33.369
down at that depth?

12:33.369 --> 12:36.970
-Just the labor.
-I know. I know.

12:36.970 --> 12:39.199
-That is massive.
-Mind-boggling.

12:39.199 --> 12:41.029
CRAIG:
The way it came up, it could

12:41.029 --> 12:43.449
have been vertical at the time.

12:43.449 --> 12:44.699
Like it was part of a tunnel.

12:44.699 --> 12:46.730
How high was the Halifax tunnel?

12:46.730 --> 12:48.040
RICK:
This is roughly at the right

12:48.040 --> 12:49.040
depth, is it not?

12:49.040 --> 12:51.579
That’d be the Halifax tunnel.

12:51.579 --> 12:55.239
NARRATOR:
In 1867, searchers from

12:55.239 --> 12:56.679
the Halifax Company

12:56.679 --> 13:00.019
dug a large shaft
some 200 feet southeast

13:00.019 --> 13:02.850
of the original Money Pit.

13:02.850 --> 13:07.129
After reaching a depth of 110
feet, they constructed a tunnel

13:07.129 --> 13:09.980
heading in a northwest
direction in the hopes of

13:09.980 --> 13:13.630
reaching the treasure vault
from the side.

13:13.630 --> 13:16.380
Several feet short of their
target, they encountered

13:16.380 --> 13:19.379
what they reported to be a
two-and-a-half-foot-wide

13:19.379 --> 13:21.239
by four-foot-tall flood tunnel

13:21.239 --> 13:24.860
that was filled
with rounded stones.

13:24.860 --> 13:27.720
Although it was
a major discovery,

13:27.720 --> 13:29.759
unfortunately for
the Halifax Company,

13:29.759 --> 13:33.139
breaching the booby trap
thwarted their efforts,

13:33.139 --> 13:35.930
and by the following year, they
no longer had the financial

13:35.930 --> 13:38.110
resources to continue
operations.

13:38.110 --> 13:42.959
Could it be that Rick, Craig
and the team were wrong

13:42.959 --> 13:44.920
in their previous assessment,

13:44.920 --> 13:48.029
that they had intercepted
the original Money Pit?

13:48.029 --> 13:51.959
Is it possible that the timbers
they uncovered in borehole GG-1

13:51.959 --> 13:53.949
are actually the remains
of an abandoned

13:53.949 --> 13:56.010
19th century searcher tunnel?

13:56.010 --> 13:58.990
It’s all great news
from a historical perspective,

13:58.990 --> 14:04.370
but sad, because then we’re in,
we’re in already-worked ground.

14:04.370 --> 14:07.470
What do you think about going
to whatever depth?

14:07.470 --> 14:09.360
CRAIG:
Yeah, I’d like to take it

14:09.360 --> 14:10.279
as deep as we can.

14:10.279 --> 14:11.759
PAUL:
Be interesting to find out

14:11.759 --> 14:14.089
what we have.

14:14.689 --> 14:16.309
RICK:
Tomorrow’s another day.

14:16.309 --> 14:17.269
CRAIG:
Yeah.

14:27.269 --> 14:29.279
NARRATOR:
The next morning,

14:29.279 --> 14:30.559
as the excavation

14:30.559 --> 14:33.999
of borehole GG-1 continues
at the Money Pit site...

14:33.999 --> 14:35.339
TERRY:
Hey, Billy.

14:35.339 --> 14:37.270
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina, his partner

14:37.270 --> 14:38.490
Craig Tester,

14:38.490 --> 14:40.769
and geologist
Terry Matheson meet

14:40.769 --> 14:44.529
with heavy equipment operator
Billy Gerhardt at Smith’s Cove.

14:44.529 --> 14:46.399
Beautiful day for shorts.

14:46.399 --> 14:47.799
-It is.
-(laughter)

14:47.799 --> 14:50.269
NARRATOR:
With the days getting shorter,

14:50.269 --> 14:52.250
and with just a few weeks
remaining before

14:52.250 --> 14:54.079
major operations on the island

14:54.079 --> 14:56.279
must shut down
for the winter,

14:56.279 --> 14:59.670
Rick Lagina and his partners
are determined to excavate

14:59.670 --> 15:02.989
beneath the massive
6,000-square-foot crane pad

15:02.989 --> 15:05.649
and make what could be their
greatest breakthrough yet.

15:05.649 --> 15:08.399
Do you think you’ll have
the crane pad out today yet?

15:08.399 --> 15:09.970
Well, there’s the edge
of the crane pad.

15:09.970 --> 15:11.439
We took a little of the edge,
and I have a little of this

15:11.439 --> 15:12.810
top section to go yet.

15:12.810 --> 15:15.100
You have any holes open
right now, or...

15:15.100 --> 15:17.999
Uh, there’s a hole there
in the corner,

15:17.999 --> 15:19.879
and there’s - we’re down to
horizon up here

15:19.879 --> 15:21.379
-where those excavator
scratches are.

15:21.379 --> 15:22.379
-Okay.

15:22.379 --> 15:24.600
There’s definitely more water,
it appears, in this corner

15:24.600 --> 15:25.670
-than anywhere else.
-RICK: Yeah, it has.

15:25.670 --> 15:26.709
It’s making a lot of water.

15:26.709 --> 15:28.299
Yeah, there are some
steady streams here

15:28.299 --> 15:30.160
that are running, you know,
pretty full-on.

15:30.160 --> 15:31.929
RICK:
That’s a lot of water.

15:31.929 --> 15:35.589
Well, you know, to me,
the dye coming out

15:35.589 --> 15:38.609
in this water right through here
indicates, you know,

15:38.609 --> 15:40.100
is it part of the flood system?

15:40.100 --> 15:42.069
Let’s do this.

15:42.069 --> 15:44.549
NARRATOR:
Four weeks ago,

15:44.549 --> 15:47.439
the Oak Island team conducted
a major operation

15:47.439 --> 15:49.480
that involved pumping
thousands of gallons

15:49.480 --> 15:52.850
of water,
colored with nontoxic red dye,

15:52.850 --> 15:54.359
down borehole C-1.

15:54.359 --> 15:57.009
-MARTY: The dye has been cast.
-Copy that.

15:57.009 --> 15:58.220
NARRATOR:
They were attempting

15:58.220 --> 15:59.689
to locate the entrance

15:59.689 --> 16:02.819
of one or more flood tunnels
believed to be protecting

16:02.819 --> 16:04.309
the Money Pit treasure vault.

16:04.309 --> 16:06.899
Have you guys spotted
anything yet?

16:06.899 --> 16:09.189
NARRATOR:
Just a few hours later,

16:09.189 --> 16:10.379
metal detection expert

16:10.379 --> 16:13.899
Gary Drayton found that
red-colored water had begun

16:13.899 --> 16:16.499
seeping out of the ground
at Smith’s Cove

16:16.499 --> 16:18.930
from beneath the crane pad
that had been put in place

16:18.930 --> 16:23.790
to construct the 525-foot steel
cofferdam surrounding the area.

16:23.790 --> 16:27.649
If we’re looking for red, guys,
I’d say that’s red.

16:27.649 --> 16:30.029
NARRATOR:
It is the team’s belief

16:30.029 --> 16:31.579
that this water,

16:31.579 --> 16:34.660
which tested positive
for traces of the dye,

16:34.660 --> 16:36.709
indicated they may have
discovered the site

16:36.709 --> 16:38.600
of the so-called
convergence point--

16:38.600 --> 16:41.899
the place where the five
stone box drains,

16:41.899 --> 16:44.079
first discovered in 1850,

16:44.079 --> 16:46.930
are believed to merge into
a single flood tunnel.

16:46.930 --> 16:49.669
A flood tunnel that should
lead them directly

16:49.669 --> 16:51.940
to the Money Pit
treasure vault.

16:51.940 --> 16:56.189
If we can find one arm
of that old drain system,

16:56.189 --> 16:58.489
and that’s what’s leaking
the water right here,

16:58.489 --> 16:59.629
that’d be fantastic.

16:59.629 --> 17:02.209
Yeah. I mean, at some point,
they’re going to converge,

17:02.209 --> 17:03.759
and then we’re really
onto something.

17:03.759 --> 17:06.180
-Mm-hmm.
How much more of the crane pad

17:06.180 --> 17:07.180
do you want to remove

17:07.180 --> 17:09.359
before we start cutting these...
these trenches?

17:09.359 --> 17:11.819
Uh, I think we can remove
all of it.

17:11.819 --> 17:13.089
-Oh, really?
-Yeah.

17:13.089 --> 17:15.810
It bodes well that
there’s something to be learned

17:15.810 --> 17:16.910
underneath the crane pad.

17:16.910 --> 17:18.780
It’s just unfortunate
that it’s there, but...

17:18.780 --> 17:21.710
We have to dig under the
crane pad for a couple reasons.

17:21.710 --> 17:23.359
One is the obvious:
it’s unknown.

17:23.359 --> 17:24.560
We haven’t dug there yet.

17:24.560 --> 17:26.069
So there’s the unknown factor.

17:26.069 --> 17:28.119
There’s the fact that the

17:28.119 --> 17:30.520
If there was a drain system,
it would be converging

17:30.520 --> 17:31.870
very near that point.

17:31.870 --> 17:34.740
So, we have to look under there,
and we don’t have much time.

17:34.740 --> 17:35.740
-Okay.
-Okay.

17:35.740 --> 17:36.740
-All right.

17:36.740 --> 17:38.930
-See you in a little bit.
-Thank you, Billy.

17:38.930 --> 17:42.770
-Very good.
-See you in a bit.

17:42.770 --> 17:44.630
NARRATOR:
As the operation to remove

17:44.630 --> 17:46.370
the crane pad continues

17:46.370 --> 17:47.810
at Smith’s Cove...

17:47.810 --> 17:49.250
DOUG:
Hey, Rick.

17:49.250 --> 17:51.290
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina joins

17:51.290 --> 17:52.290
Craig Tester

17:52.290 --> 17:54.330
and other members
of the Oak Island team

17:54.330 --> 17:56.280
at the Money Pit area.

17:56.280 --> 18:01.020
They are eager to see if the
excavation of borehole GG-1

18:01.020 --> 18:03.760
has turned up any new evidence
that the team is drilling

18:03.760 --> 18:06.610
in the vicinity of the original
treasure shaft.

18:06.610 --> 18:08.910
The dig’s at 159.

18:08.910 --> 18:11.460
And, uh, we’re not hitting much.

18:11.460 --> 18:14.710
You know, we’re not
we haven’t gotten much wood.

18:14.710 --> 18:17.480
That’s just, that’s the extent
of the wood we’ve found.

18:17.480 --> 18:19.130
DOUG:
But he came out with so many

18:19.130 --> 18:20.990
empty grabs before that.

18:20.990 --> 18:23.830
TERRY:
Right around 155.5, we did ten

18:23.830 --> 18:26.100
grabs and made about a foot.

18:26.100 --> 18:30.910
The last few grabs that were
brought up had nothing in them.

18:30.910 --> 18:32.660
RICK:
The dig’s at 159?

18:32.660 --> 18:33.660
159.

18:33.660 --> 18:34.760
RICK:
Well, let’s see what

18:34.760 --> 18:37.500
the next few come up with.

18:37.500 --> 18:38.500
Yeah.

18:38.500 --> 18:40.540
MARTY:
It’s a little bit disappointing

18:40.540 --> 18:41.540
in the lack

18:41.540 --> 18:42.880
of significant artifacts,

18:42.880 --> 18:44.830
from a discovery process.

18:44.830 --> 18:47.370
Anytime you work on Oak Island,
no matter what you’re doing,

18:47.370 --> 18:48.370
whether we’re digging,
drilling, exploring,

18:48.370 --> 18:52.660
you know, your expectation level
is way up here. You know?

18:52.660 --> 18:54.890
It’s always, "Today’s the day.
Aha! There it’ll be."

18:54.890 --> 18:57.350
And we don’t have that yet.

18:59.950 --> 19:00.810
RICK:
There we go.

19:03.210 --> 19:04.240
Come on, baby.

19:11.040 --> 19:11.620
No.

19:18.720 --> 19:19.620
Nothing in that one.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.050
We need to make a decision.

19:24.250 --> 19:25.250
Yeah, I agree.

19:25.250 --> 19:28.650
I’d call it.
At this point, we’re...

19:28.650 --> 19:31.800
-we’re running tight
up against it, right?

19:31.800 --> 19:32.800
-Yes.

19:32.800 --> 19:33.800
Time is our biggest enemy
right now.

19:33.800 --> 19:36.310
And if we can save some time
by cutting this off...

19:36.310 --> 19:38.410
NARRATOR:
Because Rick and the team

19:38.410 --> 19:39.780
believe they are now drilling

19:39.780 --> 19:42.340
in an area explored
by previous searchers,

19:42.340 --> 19:44.950
they see no reason
to continue excavating

19:44.950 --> 19:45.950
in borehole GG-1.

19:45.950 --> 19:48.030
Mike, we’re ready
to call it quits.

19:48.030 --> 19:50.380
-Shut this one down?
-Yeah.

19:50.380 --> 19:53.200
-Okay.
-We’re ready to move on.

19:53.200 --> 19:54.200
-Sure.
-Okay.

19:54.200 --> 19:56.670
NARRATOR:
After weeks of careful research

19:56.670 --> 19:59.200
indicating that this was
the most likely location

19:59.200 --> 20:00.680
of the original Money Pit,

20:00.680 --> 20:03.850
shutting the hole down deals
a devastating blow

20:03.850 --> 20:08.500
to the Laginas, their partners
and everyone on the island.

20:14.101 --> 20:15.275
One day after need

20:16.190 --> 20:17.551
excavation of borehole GG-1...

20:17.551 --> 20:19.830
RICK:
I’ll introduce you to everyone.

20:19.830 --> 20:21.620
Gentlemen...

20:21.620 --> 20:23.000
this is Rich Moats.

20:23.000 --> 20:25.500
NARRATOR:
...Rick Lagina has invited

20:25.500 --> 20:27.220
archeoastronomer Rich Moats

20:27.220 --> 20:31.950
to the war room for a meeting
with the Oak Island team.

20:31.950 --> 20:33.970
After having spent
a great deal of time

20:33.970 --> 20:35.800
working with Rick’s
close friend,

20:35.800 --> 20:39.580
the late author and researcher,
Zena Halpern,

20:39.580 --> 20:41.850
Rich has recently
developed a theory

20:41.850 --> 20:44.510
which he believes
may help the team find

20:44.510 --> 20:47.391
the precise location
of the Money Pit’s

20:47.391 --> 20:48.391
original treasure shaft.

20:48.391 --> 20:54.380
Gentlemen, I thank you for
asking me to come here today.

20:54.380 --> 20:56.710
I think that what I’m
about to show you

20:56.710 --> 21:00.950
is going to help you greatly in
what you’re trying to do here.

21:00.950 --> 21:04.320
What I am about to show you
is my analysis

21:04.320 --> 21:06.830
of Nolan’s Cross.

21:06.830 --> 21:09.700
As we look at the
overall view of the island

21:09.700 --> 21:11.370
and then move in closer,

21:11.370 --> 21:14.620
uh, here is, um, a shot

21:14.620 --> 21:16.650
of the five stones

21:16.650 --> 21:21.080
that comprise Nolan’s Cross.

21:21.080 --> 21:24.680
NARRATOR:
In 1981,

21:24.680 --> 21:27.060
Oak Island treasure hunter
Fred Nolan

21:27.060 --> 21:28.890
made the astonishing discovery

21:28.890 --> 21:30.750
of five cone-shaped boulders

21:30.750 --> 21:32.750
which, when connected together,

21:32.750 --> 21:38.350
formed a giant,
perfectly symmetrical cross.

21:38.350 --> 21:39.930
Although
some researchers believe

21:39.930 --> 21:42.910
that Nolan’s Cross
represents a religious

21:42.910 --> 21:45.480
and most likely
Christian symbol,

21:45.480 --> 21:47.730
just who made
the megalithic formation

21:47.730 --> 21:51.610
and for what purpose
remains a mystery.

21:51.610 --> 21:54.830
All of these stones, uh...

21:54.830 --> 21:56.520
were selected and shaped

21:56.520 --> 22:00.430
to be roughly
the same size and shape

22:00.430 --> 22:02.500
and stand six-foot
above the ground.

22:02.500 --> 22:05.730
They were often called cones.

22:05.730 --> 22:07.890
There are only five stones

22:07.890 --> 22:11.510
on this island
of that size and shape.

22:11.510 --> 22:13.330
There are no other stones,

22:13.330 --> 22:15.110
to my understanding,

22:15.110 --> 22:17.240
that are conical shaped

22:17.240 --> 22:19.950
and of the same size,
is that correct?

22:19.950 --> 22:23.190
There are
significant-sized boulders,

22:23.190 --> 22:25.620
but as you say,
shaped like that?

22:25.620 --> 22:27.750
I don’t know of any.

22:27.750 --> 22:30.020
I-I haven’t seen any.

22:30.020 --> 22:32.720
So, that brings to the question:

22:32.720 --> 22:36.270
why was Nolan’s Cross
constructed?

22:36.270 --> 22:39.330
Nolan’s Cross was constructed
by engineers with

22:39.330 --> 22:43.190
ocean navigation capability
’cause it’s how they got there.

22:43.190 --> 22:44.400
-I see.
-RICH: Okay.

22:44.400 --> 22:46.150
That was their technology.

22:46.150 --> 22:47.390
That was their science.

22:47.390 --> 22:49.740
We forget about that now.

22:49.740 --> 22:52.350
You know, back in the day,

22:52.350 --> 22:54.010
-navigating by the stars...
-Yeah.

22:54.010 --> 22:57.510
-That was what you did.
-RICH: Exactly.

22:57.510 --> 22:59.650
Nolan’s Cross provides a means

22:59.650 --> 23:03.460
of relocating specific places
on the island

23:03.460 --> 23:06.490
by using navigation principles

23:06.490 --> 23:08.790
along with markers
that could not

23:08.790 --> 23:12.170
be changed by natural processes.

23:12.170 --> 23:13.860
They were using sunrises

23:13.860 --> 23:16.810
and the stars
for terrestrial navigation.

23:16.810 --> 23:17.940
Okay?

23:17.940 --> 23:22.010
The association of Nolan’s Cross
with the Christian cross

23:22.010 --> 23:24.360
suggests a group of people,

23:24.360 --> 23:29.000
highly motivated by a fervent
Christian belief system,

23:29.000 --> 23:31.660
constructed Nolan’s Cross.

23:31.660 --> 23:34.540
Together, this points
to a subgroup

23:34.540 --> 23:35.970
of sailors and navigators

23:35.970 --> 23:39.390
I believe known
as the Knights Templar.

23:39.390 --> 23:42.820
NARRATOR:
It is believed by many,

23:42.820 --> 23:44.470
including some of the Mi’kmaqs,

23:44.470 --> 23:47.240
the first nation people
of Nova Scotia,

23:47.240 --> 23:48.900
that members
of the Knights Templar

23:48.900 --> 23:51.030
sailed from Europe
to North America

23:51.030 --> 23:54.610
as early as the 14th century.

23:54.610 --> 23:55.610
According to them,

23:55.610 --> 23:57.570
the Templars arrived
on Oak Island

23:57.570 --> 23:59.520
and constructed
what is now known

23:59.520 --> 24:00.710
as the Money Pit.

24:00.710 --> 24:03.020
There, they hid a vast treasure

24:03.020 --> 24:04.120
that they had accumulated

24:04.120 --> 24:06.630
during their years
in the Holy Land,

24:06.630 --> 24:10.470
including the golden menorah
from King Solomon’s Temple,

24:10.470 --> 24:11.470
the Holy Grail

24:11.470 --> 24:15.370
and even
the Ark of the Covenant.

24:15.370 --> 24:17.570
Nolan’s Cross is a device

24:17.570 --> 24:19.850
so large that its true purpose

24:19.850 --> 24:22.480
would not be easily recognized.

24:22.480 --> 24:24.040
RICK:
The other thing

24:24.040 --> 24:25.650
about Nolan’s Cross is...

24:25.650 --> 24:27.410
the permanence of the structure.

24:27.410 --> 24:30.220
What is the one way,
long ago, that you’re guaranteed

24:30.220 --> 24:32.160
that your map...

24:32.160 --> 24:34.990
stays where it’s needed to be?

24:34.990 --> 24:36.620
You use large stones.

24:36.620 --> 24:39.200
And you use the word "map."

24:39.200 --> 24:41.770
Conversely,
it’s not written on paper.

24:41.770 --> 24:43.900
They didn’t
have to write it on paper.

24:43.900 --> 24:47.020
All that had to be done
was the knowledge

24:47.020 --> 24:51.740
maintained as to what
the stones did.

24:51.740 --> 24:52.740
Mm-hmm.

24:52.740 --> 24:57.500
Here are the stones
making up Nolan’s Cross.

24:57.500 --> 24:59.330
If you extend the sight line

24:59.330 --> 25:02.550
C through stone A,

25:02.550 --> 25:05.400
and you extend a line from

25:05.400 --> 25:07.810
stone D across stone B...

25:07.810 --> 25:09.550
Don’t tell me that lines up.

25:09.550 --> 25:13.130
RICH:
They intersect at one location.

25:13.130 --> 25:16.100
MARTY:
Wow.

25:16.100 --> 25:19.080
(chuckles softly)

25:19.080 --> 25:20.830
Stone E across stone B

25:20.830 --> 25:25.700
intersects at
a different location.

25:25.700 --> 25:28.400
Those are possible
places to look...

25:28.400 --> 25:30.520
for what you might be
looking for.

25:30.520 --> 25:33.300
NARRATOR:
According to

25:33.300 --> 25:34.620
Rich Moats’ theory,

25:34.620 --> 25:36.360
by tracing
the sight lines between

25:36.360 --> 25:38.560
each stone of Nolan’s Cross,

25:38.560 --> 25:40.490
there are four
potential target sites

25:40.490 --> 25:43.350
in and around
the Money Pit area.

25:43.350 --> 25:44.880
One of which, Rich believes,

25:44.880 --> 25:48.130
is the location
of the original treasure shaft.

25:48.130 --> 25:51.430
I have already given you

25:51.430 --> 25:53.920
places where I hope
you would search,

25:53.920 --> 25:56.700
but the most important
of these...

25:56.700 --> 25:58.290
is "Site Three."

25:58.290 --> 26:00.120
I strongly implore you

26:00.120 --> 26:04.030
to search the earth
to see what may be there.

26:04.030 --> 26:06.030
RICK:
First, I want to say thank you.

26:06.030 --> 26:07.220
We’re certainly intrigued,

26:07.220 --> 26:11.060
’cause you’ve been kind enough
to give us proper coordinates.

26:11.060 --> 26:13.390
NARRATOR:
Could Rich Moats’

26:13.390 --> 26:15.510
incredible theory be true?

26:15.510 --> 26:17.930
Is Nolan’s Cross really part

26:17.930 --> 26:20.590
of an ingenious treasure map
created by

26:20.590 --> 26:23.440
members of the Knights Templar
centuries ago?

26:23.440 --> 26:27.010
And if so, could this explain
the lead cross

26:27.010 --> 26:30.370
and other artifacts that
the team has recently found

26:30.370 --> 26:32.000
and scientifically traced

26:32.000 --> 26:34.270
to a 14th century lead mine

26:34.270 --> 26:35.940
in Southern France?

26:35.940 --> 26:38.390
RICK:
He’s bringing all this

26:38.390 --> 26:40.260
disparate information to bear

26:40.260 --> 26:41.670
and he’s come up
with this theory

26:41.670 --> 26:43.620
that indeed, Nolan’s Cross

26:43.620 --> 26:45.540
is a map on top of the ground.

26:45.540 --> 26:48.730
Many, many theorists
have suggested that.

26:48.730 --> 26:51.580
Not a single one of them
have done what Rich has done.

26:51.580 --> 26:54.480
Rich actually puts
X marks the spot

26:54.480 --> 26:56.830
on the ground, on Oak Island.

26:56.830 --> 26:58.030
We appreciate everything
you’ve done.

26:58.030 --> 26:59.980
GARY:
That was fascinating.

26:59.980 --> 27:03.810
-RICK: Yep, absolutely stunning.
-You’re welcome. Thank you, sir.

27:08.110 --> 27:10.340
NARRATOR:
One day after the team’s

27:10.340 --> 27:11.340
meeting with

27:11.340 --> 27:12.710
Oak Island theorist
Rich Moats...

27:12.710 --> 27:14.670
-CRAIG: Morning, Mike.
-Morning, Craig.

27:14.670 --> 27:16.560
-How are you this morning?
-Good, yourself?

27:16.560 --> 27:17.560
Oh, not bad.

27:17.560 --> 27:19.430
...Craig Tester arrives
at the new

27:19.430 --> 27:20.580
60-inch-wide borehole

27:20.580 --> 27:23.559
that Rich had designated
as Site Three,

27:23.559 --> 27:26.450
and where the Oak Island team
hopes will find evidence

27:26.450 --> 27:28.570
of the original
Money Pit treasure shaft.

27:28.570 --> 27:31.500
-Hey, Craig, how you doing?
-Good.

27:31.500 --> 27:32.500
-Freezing.
-So...

27:32.500 --> 27:36.400
-the teeth are at
33 feet below grade.

27:36.400 --> 27:37.400
-Okay.

27:37.400 --> 27:38.940
The dig, uh, five-foot of plug,

27:38.940 --> 27:41.610
so the dig is at, uh, 28 feet.

27:41.610 --> 27:43.180
The hammer grab
seems to be bringing up

27:43.180 --> 27:45.630
an awful lot of timber.

27:45.630 --> 27:46.860
From about eight feet down.

27:46.860 --> 27:47.880
CRAIG:
Well, that’s expected.

27:47.880 --> 27:48.910
So we should be

27:48.910 --> 27:51.800
in it for a while,
but then once we get

27:51.800 --> 27:54.920
down to the important areas,
the 100-foot range and below.

27:54.920 --> 27:57.440
-It’s a great spot.
-Okay.

27:57.440 --> 27:59.471
It’s an unknown territory
by degrees.

27:59.471 --> 28:02.860
NARRATOR:
As the team continues

28:02.860 --> 28:05.450
their excavation
at Site Three...

28:05.450 --> 28:07.200
BILLY:
The water is coming

28:07.200 --> 28:08.300
right here for sure.

28:08.300 --> 28:10.270
-RICK: Under the crane pad?
-CHARLES: Yeah.

28:10.270 --> 28:12.980
...brothers Rick
and Marty Lagina,

28:12.980 --> 28:14.990
along with Charles Barkhouse,

28:14.990 --> 28:16.480
arrive at Smith’s Cove.

28:16.480 --> 28:19.560
They are responding to news
that heavy equipment operator

28:19.560 --> 28:22.470
Billy Gerhardt may have made
a potentially important

28:22.470 --> 28:24.260
discovery at the beach.

28:24.260 --> 28:27.370
So that water was leaking out
more like there

28:27.370 --> 28:28.370
-than here, right?
BILLY: It was leaking out

28:28.370 --> 28:29.370
there,

28:29.370 --> 28:30.370
but the source is somewheres

28:30.370 --> 28:32.290
right in this general area.

28:32.290 --> 28:33.770
-CHARLES: See it pouring
right there.

28:33.770 --> 28:34.770
-BILLY: Yeah.

28:34.770 --> 28:35.990
CHARLES:
Right near your left foot.

28:35.990 --> 28:38.820
And there’s some timbers
in there, too.

28:38.820 --> 28:40.250
(Rick grunting)

28:40.250 --> 28:43.700
Obviously we got into
something here,

28:43.700 --> 28:45.760
-though, right?
-RICK: Definitely something.

28:45.760 --> 28:47.920
MARTY:
Where did the crane pad

28:47.920 --> 28:50.200
come out to,
Billy, about right here?

28:50.200 --> 28:52.790
Uh, there where
that foot-and-a-half boulder is.

28:52.790 --> 28:54.270
RICK:
Well, there’s a bunch more

28:54.270 --> 28:55.550
boards in there.

28:55.550 --> 28:57.670
BILLY:
It looks like the wood

28:57.670 --> 29:00.170
is a foot deep
under the crane pad.

29:00.170 --> 29:02.510
NARRATOR:
Wood?

29:02.510 --> 29:06.700
Buried as much as one foot deep
beneath the crane pad?

29:06.700 --> 29:07.700
Could it be the remnants

29:07.700 --> 29:10.040
of yet another
man-made structure?

29:10.040 --> 29:13.890
If so, is it one put there
by a previous searcher

29:13.890 --> 29:17.670
or by someone much earlier?

29:17.670 --> 29:20.000
And could it be associated
with the flood tunnel

29:20.000 --> 29:24.200
believed to lead directly to
the Money Pit treasure vault?

29:24.200 --> 29:27.330
There’s another board here.

29:27.330 --> 29:28.650
BILLY:
It looks like a structure.

29:28.650 --> 29:30.460
-CHARLES: Yeah, right in here.
-RICK: Yeah.

29:30.460 --> 29:32.420
I suppose there’s a possibility

29:32.420 --> 29:34.350
someone thought they found
the flood tunnel,

29:34.350 --> 29:35.470
tried to block it right here.

29:35.470 --> 29:36.470
CHARLES:
Yeah.

29:36.470 --> 29:38.690
RICK:
Well, I would say...

29:38.690 --> 29:40.760
-keep digging.
-BILLY: Yeah.

29:40.760 --> 29:47.550
-I’d just dig it real slow.
-MARTY: I would.

29:47.550 --> 29:54.950
-CHARLES: Yeah.
-So let’s keep digging, Billy.

29:54.950 --> 29:57.150
Hope springs eternal
every time somebody says,

29:57.150 --> 29:58.320
"Hey, we got
a new structure, we got

29:58.320 --> 30:00.360
a new find, you better
come here and look."

30:00.360 --> 30:01.440
It’s always exciting.

30:01.440 --> 30:03.740
I think it’s reasonably likely

30:03.740 --> 30:05.680
that the crane pad
was obscuring

30:05.680 --> 30:07.660
some significant answers.

30:07.660 --> 30:11.450
-RICK: Hey, Gary.
-Anything exciting going on?

30:11.450 --> 30:12.490
MARTY:
We just pulled a bunch

30:12.490 --> 30:13.650
of planks out of there, so
we’re thinking it might be time

30:13.650 --> 30:15.020
to do a quick sweep.

30:15.020 --> 30:16.170
GARY:
Okay.

30:16.170 --> 30:19.059
CHARLES:
Oh, look at here.

30:19.059 --> 30:21.030
See a crosspiece on it, now.

30:21.030 --> 30:22.300
And there’s one
going in that way.

30:22.300 --> 30:24.030
-GARY: Yeah.
CHARLES: you got All that

30:24.030 --> 30:25.030
water behind it.

30:25.030 --> 30:26.030
GARY:
I think you got

30:26.030 --> 30:27.030
your answer there.

30:27.030 --> 30:29.000
The water’s running,
they tried to stop the water.

30:34.900 --> 30:36.040
RICK:
That’s a brace,

30:36.140 --> 30:37.170
that’s not the wall,

30:37.170 --> 30:38.360
so it probably
goes back further.

30:38.760 --> 30:39.960
CHARLES:
Yeah.

30:39.960 --> 30:42.360
RICK:
I don’t know

30:42.360 --> 30:44.260
what to make of it.

30:44.260 --> 30:45.830
Why so many structures

30:45.830 --> 30:48.290
in a very confined space.

30:48.290 --> 30:50.690
I-It’s hard to fathom.

30:50.690 --> 30:53.550
And there’s still one
yet to uncover.

30:53.550 --> 30:55.770
That may give us, uh,
a little more insight

30:55.770 --> 30:57.850
as to what actually
occurs between

30:57.850 --> 30:59.340
Smith’s Cove and the Money Pit.

30:59.340 --> 31:01.800
Looks like you’ve really opened
the floodgates, now.

31:01.800 --> 31:04.429
Maybe it is a floodgate.

31:10.229 --> 31:11.370
One day after discovery

31:11.670 --> 31:14.960
of a possible floodgate
at Smith’s Cove,

31:14.960 --> 31:17.510
Craig Tester,
historian Paul Troutman

31:17.510 --> 31:19.770
and geologist Terry Matheson,

31:19.770 --> 31:21.420
returned to the Money Pit area

31:21.420 --> 31:23.970
to monitor the progress
at Site Three.

31:23.970 --> 31:26.440
CRAIG:
So where we at?

31:26.440 --> 31:30.550
DANNY:
So, I’d say eight feet an hour.

31:30.550 --> 31:33.809
-Half an hour would be 104.
-Yeah.

31:33.809 --> 31:34.810
NARRATOR:
Since beginning

31:34.810 --> 31:35.810
to dig the shaft

31:35.810 --> 31:37.830
just two days ago,

31:37.830 --> 31:40.670
the Oak Island team has now
finally reached a depth

31:40.670 --> 31:42.640
of approximately 100 feet.

31:42.640 --> 31:47.990
-You guys will be able to make
a house here pretty soon.

31:47.990 --> 31:48.990
-Yeah.

31:48.990 --> 31:51.360
And is it Chappell or is it
just some other...

31:51.360 --> 31:54.050
This one is.
A Hedden or a Chappell.

31:54.050 --> 31:55.790
-Clearly a six by six.
-Yeah.

31:55.790 --> 31:58.820
Whereas this one,
definitely hand-hewn.

32:00.021 --> 32:02.595
Yeah, little notches, holes 
and imperfections.

32:04.820 --> 32:08.350
-All kinds of more box joints.
-Yeah. Good notch hole

32:08.350 --> 32:09.410
on that one.

32:09.410 --> 32:10.470
CRAIG:
Yeah.

32:10.470 --> 32:13.370
-That could be collapsing
of any of the old...

32:13.370 --> 32:14.620
-PAUL: The old shafts, yeah.

32:14.620 --> 32:16.230
We’re definitely
in a conglomeration of...

32:16.230 --> 32:18.120
-They were hewn by hand.
-Yeah.

32:18.120 --> 32:20.540
-That says you’re going
back a ways.

32:20.540 --> 32:21.870
-That’s for sure.

32:21.870 --> 32:23.740
NARRATOR:
Hand-hewn wood?

32:23.740 --> 32:26.050
Found at a depth of 104 feet

32:26.050 --> 32:29.070
in the Site Three borehole?

32:29.070 --> 32:31.390
Prior to the beginning
of the Industrial Revolution

32:31.390 --> 32:33.220
in the late 18th century,

32:33.220 --> 32:36.460
lumber used in construction
was cut manually,

32:36.460 --> 32:39.710
such as with an ax
or hand-operated saw.

32:39.710 --> 32:43.740
But could the hand-cut timbers
the team has just found

32:43.740 --> 32:46.350
be remnants of an early attempt
by searchers

32:46.350 --> 32:49.460
to reach the bottom
of the original Money Pit?

32:49.460 --> 32:52.120
Or have they finally
found evidence

32:52.120 --> 32:54.270
of the treasure shaft itself?

32:54.270 --> 33:00.860
TERRY:
Let’s see what’s up here.

33:00.860 --> 33:04.040
It’s just dominantly old wood.

33:04.040 --> 33:05.040
Hand-hewn.

33:05.040 --> 33:09.480
That’s a good chunk right there.

33:09.480 --> 33:12.380
TERRY:
There’s a new one.

33:14.180 --> 33:15.380
Tongue joint.

33:16.680 --> 33:17.670
Oh, that’s interesting.

33:21.470 --> 33:22.960
CRAIG:
That’s an interesting one.

33:22.960 --> 33:24.350
Yeah.
You can see it on both ends.

33:24.350 --> 33:27.070
What the heck was that used for?

33:27.670 --> 33:30.809
I don’t know.
Between something, or...

33:30.809 --> 33:34.680
-Perhaps a central support?
-Or up, over here? Or there?

33:34.680 --> 33:35.680
Central support?

33:35.680 --> 33:37.170
-Beam sitting on each side?
-For a tunnel, yeah.

33:37.170 --> 33:39.820
Maybe there was something
tunneling off all of a sudden.

33:39.820 --> 33:42.790
PAUL:
That’s encouraging. Out of all

33:42.790 --> 33:43.990
the ones we’ve been inside,

33:43.990 --> 33:46.270
this is-- I haven’t seen
anything like that.

33:46.270 --> 33:47.730
Look at the round
it’s rounded, hand-hewn, just...

33:47.730 --> 33:49.200
I mean,
what a significant effort.

33:49.200 --> 33:51.000
NARRATOR:
Because the team believes

33:51.000 --> 33:52.000
they’ve begun drilling

33:52.000 --> 33:54.760
into some kind of tunnel
or wooden structure,

33:54.760 --> 33:57.500
100 feet deep
in the Money Pit area...

33:57.500 --> 33:58.980
Dump it!

33:58.980 --> 34:00.470
...Alex Lagina,

34:00.470 --> 34:03.000
Jack Begley and Dan Henskee

34:03.000 --> 34:06.370
will meticulously search the
spoils excavated from the shaft

34:06.370 --> 34:07.850
at the nearby wash table

34:07.850 --> 34:10.599
for any important
clues, artifacts,

34:10.599 --> 34:12.730
and hopefully,
evidence of treasure.

34:12.730 --> 34:15.109
DAN H.:
Finding any pottery?

34:15.109 --> 34:17.969
-I haven’t seen any pottery.
-Yeah.

34:17.969 --> 34:20.460
-Well, that’s a different depth.
-Yeah.

34:20.460 --> 34:22.789
So if we find something
interesting, we know it is

34:22.789 --> 34:27.619
from relatively deep.
At least 100 feet down.

34:28.219 --> 34:29.219
Pottery?

34:32.319 --> 34:33.219
Pottery!

34:36.018 --> 34:37.149
ALEX:
Yeah, I think that’s...

34:37.149 --> 34:38.620
that’s definitely pottery.

34:38.920 --> 34:39.998
DAN H.:
But it’s, it’s shattered

34:39.998 --> 34:41.599
little pieces broken off.

34:41.599 --> 34:44.089
Like a teacup, or actually, a...

34:44.089 --> 34:45.580
Oh, you’re right,
’cause there is

34:45.580 --> 34:46.879
a little bit of glaze on this.

34:46.879 --> 34:49.719
Like a fine china teacup,
something like that?

34:49.719 --> 34:52.379
ALEX:
Here, I’ll, uh, I’ll bag it up

34:52.379 --> 34:54.839
-and we can show it to Laird.
-Yeah.

34:59.539 --> 35:01.680
-Here’s your purple wood.
-Is it?

35:02.780 --> 35:03.880
-Yeah, definitely
purple looking.

35:03.880 --> 35:04.880
-Yeah.

35:05.180 --> 35:06.180
DAN H.:
Must be a... must be, like,

35:06.180 --> 35:07.180
fluorescent or something.

35:07.180 --> 35:09.289
-It looks much more purple
in the sunlight.

35:10.489 --> 35:11.489
-ALEX: Right.

35:11.489 --> 35:12.869
NARRATOR:
Purple wood?

35:12.869 --> 35:16.380
JACK:
Look at this, Dan.

35:16.380 --> 35:17.380
Purple wood!

35:17.380 --> 35:19.450
NARRATOR:
Last year, while searching

35:19.450 --> 35:20.700
the spoils excavated

35:20.700 --> 35:23.019
from the nearby borehole
known as H-8,

35:23.019 --> 35:25.480
Jack Begley and Dan Henskee

35:25.480 --> 35:27.750
discovered strange pieces
of wood,

35:27.750 --> 35:30.760
which appeared to be stained
the color purple.

35:30.760 --> 35:33.619
How often was this
color purple used?

35:33.619 --> 35:36.440
Well, just in important,
uh, church documents

35:36.440 --> 35:38.579
and royal documents.

35:38.579 --> 35:40.530
NARRATOR:
When the wood

35:40.530 --> 35:41.530
was later examined

35:41.530 --> 35:44.109
by medieval book expert
Joe Landry,

35:44.109 --> 35:46.760
the purple color was thought
to have been created

35:46.760 --> 35:49.700
by means of an ancient dye
used in the production

35:49.700 --> 35:51.670
of important books
and manuscripts

35:51.670 --> 35:54.299
throughout the Middle Ages.

35:54.299 --> 35:56.579
Could the presence
of this purple wood,

35:56.579 --> 35:58.619
found alongside pieces
of pottery,

35:58.619 --> 36:01.359
be evidence that the team
has in fact located

36:01.359 --> 36:03.779
part of the original Money Pit?

36:03.779 --> 36:08.809
-PAUL: Oh, wow, look at that!
-DANNY: Look at that scoop!

36:08.809 --> 36:10.309
-Whoa-ho-ho!
-That’s quite the jumble.

36:10.609 --> 36:13.670
We haven’t encountered,
uh, pieces like this before

36:13.970 --> 36:16.190
that are this solid.

36:18.490 --> 36:19.859
What do you make of this, Craig?

36:20.059 --> 36:22.570
I saw that all come up.

36:22.570 --> 36:26.269
They came... these...
most of them came up vertical.

36:26.269 --> 36:27.390
-Those were vertical?
-Yeah.

36:27.390 --> 36:29.019
TERRY:
I like our chances of being

36:29.019 --> 36:31.390
in the collapsed structure
of the Money Pit.

36:31.390 --> 36:35.249
-Big brother!
-Where are we?

36:35.249 --> 36:36.519
CRAIG:
This is one of the last ones

36:36.519 --> 36:37.650
brought up.

36:37.650 --> 36:40.299
MARTY:
You feel like

36:40.299 --> 36:41.999
any of this is oak?

36:41.999 --> 36:44.009
Uh, yeah, there’s
some of it looks like

36:44.009 --> 36:45.529
it has an oaken grain, yeah.

36:45.529 --> 36:47.289
CRAIG:
Yeah, then we get those things,

36:47.289 --> 36:48.920
which are obviously old.

36:48.920 --> 36:50.269
TERRY:
Hand-hewn.

36:50.269 --> 36:53.069
What we were thinking
is varied materials

36:53.069 --> 36:55.160
cobbled together to hold the...

36:55.160 --> 36:57.489
side of the actual
Money Pit together.

36:57.489 --> 37:01.940
-That’s good.
-Let’s cross our fingers.

37:01.940 --> 37:03.579
Is it, perhaps,

37:03.579 --> 37:04.960
part of the original Money Pit?

37:04.960 --> 37:07.150
The only thing I can think of:
whoever built the Money Pit

37:07.150 --> 37:09.789
would have cared,
and oak would last better,

37:09.789 --> 37:12.549
would be heavier,
would be stronger, so if...

37:12.549 --> 37:16.230
if these anomalously
large timbers are oak,

37:16.230 --> 37:19.100
then yeah, it could be part
of the original Money Pit.

37:19.500 --> 37:20.740
Okay. Good.

37:20.740 --> 37:21.780
Keep going.

37:21.780 --> 37:23.220
Find something.

37:27.420 --> 37:28.740
Yup.

37:28.740 --> 37:31.289
NARRATOR:
As a new day begins

37:31.289 --> 37:32.950
on Oak Island...

37:32.950 --> 37:35.400
brothers Rick and Marty Lagina,

37:35.400 --> 37:37.710
along with their partner
Craig Tester,

37:37.710 --> 37:39.460
head back to the Money Pit area

37:39.460 --> 37:43.599
to continue supervising
the excavation of Site Three.

37:47.799 --> 37:49.700
MARTY:
Ominously quiet.

37:49.700 --> 37:51.570
I’m not seeing anybody.

37:52.470 --> 37:55.740
RICK:
What’s going on?

37:55.740 --> 37:57.829
CRAIG:
I don’t know.

37:57.829 --> 37:59.390
Hammer grab’s down.

37:59.390 --> 38:03.560
CRAIG:
That does not look good.

38:03.560 --> 38:09.880
-(crickets chirping)
-No sounds.

38:09.880 --> 38:11.460
Crickets.

38:11.460 --> 38:12.460
We got crickets.

38:12.460 --> 38:14.019
-Nobody’s working.
-CRAIG: Yeah.

38:14.019 --> 38:16.499
-MARTY: We’re in trouble.
-RICK: Yes.

38:16.499 --> 38:18.980
Mike’s here, though.
Let’s go in.

38:18.980 --> 38:23.839
-Yeah, let’s go in the trailer.
-RICK: Yup.

38:23.839 --> 38:25.430
As we pull onto the pad,

38:25.430 --> 38:27.349
it is very clear
that nothing’s running.

38:27.349 --> 38:29.430
The men are gone.

38:29.430 --> 38:32.160
I mean, this looks serious.

38:32.160 --> 38:33.760
Hey, Mike.

38:33.760 --> 38:35.369
Morning, guys.

38:35.369 --> 38:36.980
RICK:
There’s something

38:36.980 --> 38:37.980
going on, and...

38:37.980 --> 38:39.549
we want answers.

38:39.549 --> 38:42.079
MARTY:
Pretty quiet out there.

38:42.079 --> 38:44.339
JARDINE:
Way too quiet for my likings.

38:44.339 --> 38:48.819
So, it’s a very
disappointing morning for me.

38:48.819 --> 38:49.880
-Right.
-Yeah.

38:49.880 --> 38:50.890
We got the word
this morning that

38:50.890 --> 38:53.529
the crane operators...

38:53.529 --> 38:56.069
they are on strike.

38:56.069 --> 38:57.750
NARRATOR:
A strike?

38:57.750 --> 38:59.779
One that has shut down

38:59.779 --> 39:03.230
drilling operations
on Oak Island?

39:03.230 --> 39:05.789
Although the crane operators
at the Money Pit site

39:05.789 --> 39:08.430
are employed
by Irving Equipment Limited,

39:08.430 --> 39:09.749
their rates are regulated

39:09.749 --> 39:14.079
by the Nova Scotia Construction
Labor Relations Association.

39:14.079 --> 39:16.790
Over the past 24 hours,
the union,

39:16.790 --> 39:19.809
which represents some
100 heavy machine operators

39:19.809 --> 39:22.609
throughout Nova Scotia,
went on strike

39:22.609 --> 39:25.910
due to wage issues unrelated
to the work on Oak Island.

39:25.910 --> 39:29.079
JARDINE:
I am in touch with my guys

39:29.079 --> 39:30.410
back at the office

39:30.410 --> 39:32.450
that’s, you know,
digging into that to see

39:32.450 --> 39:34.779
what they can find out,
to see what we’re up against.

39:34.779 --> 39:37.089
-It’s just a waiting game.
-Mm-hmm.

39:37.089 --> 39:38.569
Uh, we know that...

39:38.569 --> 39:42.070
they are negotiating again
and-and... and they’re hoping

39:42.070 --> 39:46.349
to have this resolved
within 21 days.

39:46.349 --> 39:49.180
NARRATOR:
The fact that operations

39:49.180 --> 39:51.450
at the Money Pit site
cannot continue

39:51.450 --> 39:53.369
for what could be
the next three weeks

39:53.369 --> 39:58.690
offers yet another setback
for Rick, Marty and their team.

39:58.690 --> 40:01.040
The harsh winter weather is
already setting in...

40:01.040 --> 40:05.259
and it won’t be long
before conditions on the island

40:05.259 --> 40:07.720
become too difficult
to resume drilling.

40:07.720 --> 40:10.739
MARTY:
For me, it’s a big

40:10.739 --> 40:11.739
disappointment,

40:11.739 --> 40:12.900
because I want to put an X
through something,

40:12.900 --> 40:14.279
and the Money Pit, you know,

40:14.279 --> 40:16.869
we’ve thrown a lot
of resources at it.

40:16.869 --> 40:18.319
We can’t proceed,

40:18.319 --> 40:21.930
and we are coming
tight up against some windows.

40:21.930 --> 40:24.970
We are running out of time.

40:24.970 --> 40:27.170
I think I speak
for these two guys.

40:27.170 --> 40:29.819
Um... we understand completely.

40:29.819 --> 40:32.029
-We just soldier through this.
-Yeah.

40:32.029 --> 40:35.000
I think we got to respect
the workers’ rights here.

40:35.000 --> 40:37.570
-Yep.
-So, we’ll let this play out.

40:37.570 --> 40:39.040
-Yep, absolutely.
-MARTY: Okay.

40:39.040 --> 40:40.869
Good. Thank you.
Appreciate it.

40:40.869 --> 40:43.070
-RICK: Thanks, Mike.
-JARDINE: Thanks, guys.

40:43.070 --> 40:45.670
NARRATOR:
For Rick, Marty and their team,

40:45.670 --> 40:47.780
the bitter realization
that their efforts

40:47.780 --> 40:51.440
to find the original Money Pit
have been halted by a strike

40:51.440 --> 40:54.989
is both heartbreaking
and infuriating.

40:54.989 --> 40:56.229
Nevertheless...

40:56.229 --> 40:59.940
they are determined
to make the best of it.

40:59.940 --> 41:02.339
If experience
has taught them anything,

41:02.339 --> 41:04.849
it is that patience
and persistence

41:04.849 --> 41:07.780
are stronger
than any drilling caisson.

41:07.780 --> 41:11.029
They can now redouble
their exploration efforts

41:11.029 --> 41:13.220
at Smith’s Cove.

41:13.220 --> 41:17.339
They will also have time
to examine new theories...

41:17.339 --> 41:20.319
evaluate new evidence...

41:20.319 --> 41:23.460
and employ new methods of
reaching their ultimate goal:

41:23.460 --> 41:25.749
the discovery
of a treasure vault

41:25.749 --> 41:29.210
that has endured centuries
of setbacks,

41:29.210 --> 41:31.579
and whose secrets
have remained hidden,

41:31.579 --> 41:35.789
at least... for now.

41:35.789 --> 41:37.690
Next time on
The Curse of Oak Island...

41:37.690 --> 41:38.690
Look over there, Marty.

41:38.690 --> 41:40.180
-Is that a wall?
-RICK: Yep.

41:40.880 --> 41:42.370
Yeah, there it is right there.

41:42.570 --> 41:44.010
I think it’s a shaft.

41:44.010 --> 41:46.160
-(beeping)
-JACK: I see it!

41:46.160 --> 41:49.100
Yeah, that’s 1700s
all over it, mate.

41:49.100 --> 41:51.300
JAMES:
The Knights Baronet

41:51.300 --> 41:52.500
are connected

41:52.500 --> 41:53.450
to the Knights Templar,

41:53.750 --> 41:55.400
and might be responsible

41:55.400 --> 41:57.359
for a treasure buried
on Oak Island.

41:57.359 --> 41:59.069
GARY:
All right, here we go.

41:59.069 --> 42:01.349
-What do you got?
-I don’t know yet,

42:01.349 --> 42:02.590
but it looks shiny!
