Hi, Emily.

00:35.252 --> 00:37.124
Hey, what's up? How are you?

00:41.780 --> 00:43.521
No.

00:43.565 --> 00:45.306
He is definitely the most

00:45.349 --> 00:47.656
well-adjusted guy
I've ever dated.

00:47.699 --> 00:49.484
I know,
and the hottest.

01:00.147 --> 01:01.844
No, I'm not worried about her.

01:02.888 --> 01:04.194
Absolutely not.

01:04.238 --> 01:06.762
Emily, I swear,
I wouldn't even show up.

01:44.191 --> 01:46.323
Hello? Hello?

01:51.546 --> 01:53.461
Hello? Are you okay?

01:53.504 --> 01:55.245
Is something wrong?

01:56.986 --> 01:58.466
Are you okay?

01:58.509 --> 02:00.903
Hello? Hello?

02:10.347 --> 02:12.044
No, stop.

03:16.239 --> 03:17.153
Uh, Mr. Simon?

03:18.241 --> 03:20.069
Uh, Brian. Yeah.

03:20.112 --> 03:21.244
I'm Amber Deschanel.

03:21.288 --> 03:22.550
I'm so embarrassed.

03:22.593 --> 03:23.899
I was supposed to be here

03:23.942 --> 03:25.335
half an hour ago
for my interview.

03:25.379 --> 03:26.597
I got caught in traffic.

03:26.641 --> 03:28.338
Um, I tried calling,

03:28.382 --> 03:30.122
but I just kept
getting voicemail.

03:30.166 --> 03:32.951
Uh, we were interviewing
other au pairs.

03:32.995 --> 03:35.737
Um, well, I wasn't even
going to come

03:35.780 --> 03:37.869
because I couldn't imagine that
you would hire someone

03:37.913 --> 03:39.697
that was late
for their interview.

03:39.741 --> 03:41.264
But I thought
I should at least come

03:41.308 --> 03:44.006
and apologize to you in person.

03:44.049 --> 03:45.007
So...

03:45.050 --> 03:47.270
Um, I apologize.

03:49.403 --> 03:51.274
Uh, um... Hang on a second.
Why don't you...

03:52.797 --> 03:54.495
Uh, why don't you come on in?

03:54.538 --> 03:55.496
Are you sure?

03:55.539 --> 03:56.975
Yeah. Yeah, come in.

04:04.853 --> 04:05.984
Miss Simon?

04:07.247 --> 04:08.726
Oh, Elise.

04:08.770 --> 04:10.337
It's so nice to meet you.

04:10.380 --> 04:12.121
Uh, are you from this area?

04:12.164 --> 04:14.210
I am. Uh, well, I am now.

04:14.254 --> 04:16.125
I have an apartment
near the hospital.

04:16.168 --> 04:18.432
I just finished
an internship there.

04:18.475 --> 04:21.783
Eventually, I'll be going
to nursing school.

04:21.826 --> 04:24.873
Nice. Um, well, why don't you
come in, take a seat?

04:24.916 --> 04:25.961
You want a glass of water
or anything?

04:26.004 --> 04:27.789
Uh, no. No, I'm fine.

04:38.234 --> 04:39.670
So, tell us about yourself.

04:39.714 --> 04:42.238
Uh, I majored in nursing
at Southern.

04:42.282 --> 04:44.632
But, to be honest,
it's so expensive

04:44.675 --> 04:46.329
that after I graduated,

04:46.373 --> 04:47.939
I thought I would
save a little money

04:47.983 --> 04:49.506
and work as an au pair.

04:49.550 --> 04:52.161
I love kids,
and it beats waiting tables.

04:52.204 --> 04:54.903
How do you feel about the whole
cleaning part of it?

04:56.774 --> 04:59.560
Well, I like kids
more than cleaning,

04:59.603 --> 05:01.736
but it still beats
waiting tables.

05:01.779 --> 05:03.825
But do you have experience
as an au pair?

05:03.868 --> 05:05.479
Oh. Ah, yes, here.

05:05.522 --> 05:06.871
Um...

05:06.915 --> 05:10.092
Great. Thank you.

05:10.135 --> 05:11.833
Uh, last year,
I spent six months

05:11.876 --> 05:14.052
with a wonderful family,

05:14.096 --> 05:16.403
down at Coulson Lake.
The Falcones.

05:16.446 --> 05:18.579
Unfortunately, the father
was transferred to Dallas,

05:18.622 --> 05:20.015
so that was that.

05:20.058 --> 05:21.669
But feel free, please call them.

05:21.712 --> 05:23.061
We were really close.

05:23.105 --> 05:25.673
I was like a member
of their family.

05:25.716 --> 05:28.240
Well, um, let's see.

05:28.284 --> 05:30.591
What about, uh, first aid?

05:30.634 --> 05:32.897
I, I do have basic
first aid training

05:32.941 --> 05:34.638
of CPR and AED.

05:34.682 --> 05:37.641
I'm also pediatrically
and aquatically trained.

05:37.685 --> 05:40.862
And I am certified
as an allergy responder.

05:40.905 --> 05:42.951
Most of these certifications
I got through the university,

05:42.994 --> 05:45.214
but I've kept them all
up to date.

05:45.257 --> 05:47.390
Oh.

05:47.434 --> 05:49.087
That's Cody you hear now.

05:49.131 --> 05:51.176
Oh... Um, should I leave?

05:51.220 --> 05:53.004
- Uh... No.
- No.

05:53.048 --> 05:54.702
- No.
- Just...

05:54.745 --> 05:57.531
Uh, no. Why don't you stay here,
and, um...

05:59.533 --> 06:00.795
I'll go get him.

06:10.195 --> 06:12.067
So...

06:12.110 --> 06:13.808
Uh...

06:13.851 --> 06:15.810
Duschanel? Deschanel?

06:15.853 --> 06:18.160
Amber Deschanel.

06:18.203 --> 06:20.075
Deschanel. Is that French?

06:20.118 --> 06:22.164
- It's French-Canadian.
- French-Canadian.

06:22.207 --> 06:23.470
Yeah, I was born in Montreal.

06:23.513 --> 06:25.820
Um, but I grew up in Toronto.

06:25.863 --> 06:27.561
I came to the States
for college,

06:27.604 --> 06:30.346
and... I don't see myself
ever leaving.

06:32.043 --> 06:34.829
But you can never be president.

06:34.872 --> 06:36.439
No, I can never be president.

06:39.094 --> 06:40.443
Uh...

06:48.408 --> 06:50.235
He's adorable.

06:50.279 --> 06:52.542
Cody, this is Amber.
Can you say hi?

06:52.586 --> 06:54.152
Nice to meet you, little man.

06:56.328 --> 06:58.200
He's strong.

06:58.243 --> 06:59.201
Oh.

07:00.898 --> 07:02.857
Well, I don't wanna overstay
my welcome.

07:02.900 --> 07:05.250
I'm sure you guys want some
family time.

07:05.294 --> 07:08.166
To be totally honest with you,
you seem like

07:08.210 --> 07:11.474
such a nice family, and I would
take really good care of Cody.

07:11.518 --> 07:13.171
If you give me a chance

07:13.215 --> 07:14.695
I'll prove that I'm worth it.

07:16.566 --> 07:18.829
All right. Um...

07:18.873 --> 07:21.571
Let me walk you to the door.

07:21.615 --> 07:24.095
It was really nice to meet you,
Mister, um...

07:24.139 --> 07:26.141
- Brian.
- Brian.

07:26.184 --> 07:27.882
It was a pleasure, Amber.

07:35.846 --> 07:38.022
Well, Amber, uh,

07:38.066 --> 07:40.721
we've got a lot of candidates
that we still need to interview,

07:40.764 --> 07:43.854
but, uh,
we've got your number, so...

07:43.898 --> 07:45.552
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

07:46.640 --> 07:47.554
Okay.

08:11.447 --> 08:12.970
Okay.

08:13.014 --> 08:14.711
I admit it, I liked her.

08:19.368 --> 08:21.109
No...

08:21.152 --> 08:23.546
you don't have to decide
right away.

08:23.590 --> 08:26.027
You can call her references and
see what they have to say first.

08:26.070 --> 08:27.332
Yeah, okay.

08:28.333 --> 08:29.683
Maybe...

08:29.726 --> 08:30.988
Maybe, I will, yeah.

08:35.210 --> 08:38.256
What's the matter?
You don't seem so happy.

08:38.299 --> 08:39.475
This was your idea, remember?

08:40.389 --> 08:41.738
I know.

08:43.044 --> 08:44.436
I know.

08:49.485 --> 08:50.921
She's pretty.

08:53.881 --> 08:56.100
- Don't you think?
- Um...

08:58.189 --> 09:00.235
I mean, she's okay.

09:00.278 --> 09:01.889
Pleasant, I guess.

09:01.932 --> 09:03.891
Little plain Jane looking.

09:03.934 --> 09:05.632
But we're not signing her
to a modeling contract,

09:05.675 --> 09:06.894
so it's perfect.

09:08.678 --> 09:09.766
Look, if you're against
the idea,

09:09.810 --> 09:10.941
we don't have to go for it.

09:10.985 --> 09:12.290
I'm fine with that.

09:13.857 --> 09:15.206
Okay.

09:18.993 --> 09:21.517
I'll call her references
in the morning.

09:21.561 --> 09:22.823
Good.

09:44.061 --> 09:45.367
No?

09:48.979 --> 09:50.764
Nothing.

09:55.507 --> 09:57.597
How long are you gonna
punish me for?

10:41.641 --> 10:44.469
- You didn't hear, did you?
- Hmm.

10:44.513 --> 10:46.080
I can tell by the look
on your face, you didn't hear.

10:46.123 --> 10:47.211
Hear what?

10:50.127 --> 10:52.477
Dude, we got the frickin'
Virtue Ed account.

10:52.521 --> 10:53.957
- What?
- We got it.

10:54.001 --> 10:55.263
- We got the Virtue Ed account?
- We got it.

10:55.306 --> 10:56.656
We got the Virtue Ed account!
Whoo!

10:56.699 --> 10:57.918
Whoa! We got...

10:59.354 --> 11:00.311
- We got...
- We got it!

11:00.355 --> 11:01.573
- Yeah!
- Yes!

11:01.617 --> 11:03.358
Yeah!

11:03.401 --> 11:05.403
When did you hear?

11:05.447 --> 11:06.753
- Come here.
- What?

11:13.760 --> 11:15.544
The ice queen came to my office.

11:15.587 --> 11:17.764
She just got off the phone
with the chairman and the board,

11:17.807 --> 11:20.723
and press release
goes out EOD, baby.

11:20.767 --> 11:22.377
She said she wanted to come
tell you next,

11:22.420 --> 11:24.945
but I said I wanted to be
the one to tell you.

11:24.988 --> 11:27.121
Bro, I-I just don't believe it.

11:27.164 --> 11:31.255
- I-I mean...
- Dude, we are going out tonight.

11:31.299 --> 11:33.867
Polecats, Heartbreakers.

11:33.910 --> 11:35.433
♪ Leopard Lounge ♪

11:35.477 --> 11:36.913
Yes!

11:36.957 --> 11:38.262
Bro, you know what?

11:38.306 --> 11:39.568
I-I gotta call Elise.

11:39.611 --> 11:41.135
Uh, get out.

11:41.178 --> 11:43.180
All right, dude, then,
a drink or three

11:43.224 --> 11:45.095
before I go over there
to find my new wife.

11:45.139 --> 11:47.445
I gotta call Elise.

11:47.489 --> 11:49.317
What happened to you, man?

11:52.189 --> 11:53.625
You play on those if you want.

11:56.367 --> 11:58.892
Hey, I was just
about to call you.

11:58.935 --> 12:02.286
So, listen, I called
Amber's references this morning.

12:02.330 --> 12:04.375
- And?
- And...

12:04.419 --> 12:09.206
Well, the reviews were,
um, glowing.

12:09.250 --> 12:12.644
Basically, every single thing
that was on our checklist.

12:12.688 --> 12:15.299
Well, see?
I had a good feeling about it.

12:15.343 --> 12:16.779
But forget about that
for a second.

12:16.823 --> 12:19.260
I have even bigger news.

12:19.303 --> 12:20.957
We got the Virtue Ed account.

12:22.002 --> 12:23.177
Wait, what?

12:23.220 --> 12:24.961
Wait, that's...

12:25.005 --> 12:26.789
That's huge, isn't it?

12:26.833 --> 12:28.660
Honey, it's enormous!

12:28.704 --> 12:30.575
They're gonna spend $250 million

12:30.619 --> 12:32.360
over the next five years
marketing this service.

12:32.403 --> 12:34.536
Um, okay.

12:34.579 --> 12:37.191
So that means we can definitely
afford her, then?

12:37.234 --> 12:38.627
Short answer is,

12:38.670 --> 12:40.934
yeah, we can afford her.

12:40.977 --> 12:43.023
But I have to go now,
honey. Lot of work to do.

12:43.066 --> 12:44.589
Okay, okay,
I'll see you at home.

12:44.633 --> 12:46.809
Oh, hey, Brian?

12:46.853 --> 12:48.202
Yeah?

12:50.421 --> 12:51.988
I'm proud of you.

12:53.424 --> 12:55.644
I love you.

13:52.005 --> 13:53.354
Brian.

13:56.836 --> 13:57.793
Amber.

13:59.882 --> 14:01.797
You're early. You weren't
supposed to be here for...

14:01.841 --> 14:03.973
For another hour. I know, um...

14:04.017 --> 14:05.757
I'm sorry, I think
I just got a little paranoid

14:05.801 --> 14:07.194
because of last time.

14:07.237 --> 14:09.587
You know, how I was late
for the interview.

14:09.631 --> 14:11.546
I hope that's okay.

14:11.589 --> 14:13.548
I rang the front door first,
but nobody answered.

14:13.591 --> 14:14.505
Then I walked
right into the garage.

14:14.549 --> 14:15.811
No, it's fine.

14:16.464 --> 14:17.857
Uh...

14:19.162 --> 14:20.903
So, Elise and Cody are at their

14:20.947 --> 14:22.296
Mommy and Me self-defense group.

14:22.339 --> 14:23.688
They won't be here
for another half hour.

14:23.732 --> 14:25.081
Mm-hmm.

14:29.651 --> 14:31.827
Well, this is the gym.

14:31.871 --> 14:33.133
You can use it
whenever you want.

14:33.176 --> 14:34.612
Not exactly a health club,
but...

14:34.656 --> 14:37.267
Um, it seems to work.

14:42.751 --> 14:45.797
Uh... why don't I help you
get your things out of the car?

14:45.841 --> 14:47.277
I can show you to your room.

14:47.321 --> 14:49.018
That'd be great. Thank you.

14:57.984 --> 14:59.724
What do you have
in these things? Lead?

14:59.768 --> 15:01.335
It's all of
my possessions.

15:01.378 --> 15:03.467
And two bags aren't even that
bad for most girls.

15:05.252 --> 15:07.341
Well, here it is.

15:07.384 --> 15:09.082
ChezSimon.

15:09.125 --> 15:10.779
It's not a lot, but, uh...

15:10.822 --> 15:13.042
Are you kidding?
It's great.

15:13.086 --> 15:16.611
It's almost bigger than
my last apartment in New York.

15:16.654 --> 15:17.960
New York? I thought you said
you were staying

15:18.004 --> 15:19.744
with that family in Coulson.

15:19.788 --> 15:22.530
Yeah, um, my last apartment
in New York before that.

15:24.749 --> 15:26.229
You want help
unpacking or...

15:26.273 --> 15:29.145
Uh, no, I think I got it
from here.

15:29.189 --> 15:31.147
- Brian?
- Yeah?

15:31.191 --> 15:33.410
- Uh, yeah? Hi.
- Brian?

15:33.454 --> 15:34.977
- Hey.
- Hi.

15:35.021 --> 15:37.066
Amber! You're early.

15:37.110 --> 15:38.633
I know. I explained to Brian.

15:38.676 --> 15:39.851
After I was late
for the interview,

15:39.895 --> 15:41.505
I wanted to be absolutely sure

15:41.549 --> 15:42.985
that I was on time
for my first day,

15:43.029 --> 15:44.726
so I got here way early.

15:44.769 --> 15:46.815
Ah, well, please
make yourself at home.

15:46.858 --> 15:49.861
And if you need anything at all,
don't be scared to ask, okay?

15:49.905 --> 15:52.038
Um, can you help me
with something?

15:52.081 --> 15:53.735
- Yeah, of course.
- And we'll let her get settled.

15:53.778 --> 15:55.258
Okay.

16:04.267 --> 16:05.616
Honey...

16:07.053 --> 16:09.055
What?

16:09.098 --> 16:11.796
- Oh. Oh, that's cute.
- Yeah?

16:12.536 --> 16:13.929
Nanny cam.

16:14.843 --> 16:16.105
What?

16:18.368 --> 16:21.371
Are you se...
Are you serious?

16:21.415 --> 16:23.417
Heck, yeah, of course,
I'm serious.

16:23.460 --> 16:25.506
Hey, can't hurt
to be too careful. Come on.

16:25.549 --> 16:26.811
Where'd you even get this thing?

16:26.855 --> 16:28.248
At the mall.

16:28.291 --> 16:30.815
Look, it's, it's
a picture frame, right?

16:30.859 --> 16:32.774
It's right there.

16:32.817 --> 16:34.428
- There's the camera.
- Oh, yeah.

16:34.471 --> 16:37.735
And it records onto
any old USB drive.

16:37.779 --> 16:39.520
- You're kidding me.
- Unh-unh.

16:40.869 --> 16:42.610
Right?

16:42.653 --> 16:45.134
That is... It's brilliant.

16:45.178 --> 16:46.440
And if it makes you
feel any better,

16:46.483 --> 16:49.182
I'm completely down for whatever

16:49.225 --> 16:51.358
Mission Impossiblegadgets
you come up with

16:51.401 --> 16:53.664
as long as you don't have one
of those tucked in our bathroom.

16:54.883 --> 16:56.276
Ew.

16:56.319 --> 16:57.581
- You're gross.
- Well, I didn't buy it.

16:57.625 --> 16:58.974
You're so gross.

17:52.549 --> 17:53.985
Hey, girl.

17:54.029 --> 17:55.291
Hey.

17:57.337 --> 17:58.642
So...

18:00.035 --> 18:01.384
We took the plunge.

18:01.428 --> 18:03.038
- A threesome.
- What?

18:03.082 --> 18:05.519
Very funny.

18:05.562 --> 18:07.129
No, the au pair.

18:07.173 --> 18:08.522
- Oui, oui.
- Mm-hmm.

18:08.565 --> 18:10.524
I was finally
able to convince him

18:10.567 --> 18:12.352
that we needed one.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.136
And how did you do that?

18:14.180 --> 18:16.486
'Cause I thought he was dead set
against just the idea.

18:16.530 --> 18:18.271
Ah, with a little bit of...

18:20.490 --> 18:22.405
Well, you couldn't
punish him forever.

18:22.449 --> 18:24.538
You can hate him,
you can decide to leave him,

18:24.581 --> 18:26.801
but if you decide
you're gonna forgive him,

18:26.844 --> 18:28.150
you gotta forgive him.

18:30.370 --> 18:32.589
Do you think
I did the right thing?

18:32.633 --> 18:34.156
Please.

18:34.200 --> 18:36.680
Of all the unworthy jerks
I took back,

18:36.724 --> 18:39.118
at least your husband
is a good man.

18:39.161 --> 18:41.163
Oh.

18:45.559 --> 18:47.909
Afternoon, ladies.

18:50.259 --> 18:51.608
You want me to tell him
to leave?

18:51.652 --> 18:53.393
I don't know what good
that'll do.

18:53.436 --> 18:55.525
The man is like the Terminator.

18:55.569 --> 18:58.441
- Without a body.
- I know.

19:03.751 --> 19:05.840
How can we help you, Mr. Dutros?

19:05.883 --> 19:08.190
I've left messages.

19:08.234 --> 19:09.887
Sent electronic email.

19:09.931 --> 19:11.759
Even had my girl send
something certified.

19:11.802 --> 19:13.326
What does it take
to get your attention?

19:13.369 --> 19:15.502
Oh, you have our attention.

19:15.545 --> 19:17.156
The answer is still no.

19:17.199 --> 19:19.027
I think we both know
that's not your choice,

19:19.070 --> 19:20.376
don't we, Mrs. Simon?

19:20.420 --> 19:22.465
- It's not our choice?
- Mm.

19:22.509 --> 19:23.858
It is for now.

19:23.901 --> 19:25.773
I made you a very fair offer.

19:25.816 --> 19:27.992
One that First Federal
was hoping you'd take.

19:28.036 --> 19:30.343
First Federal doesn't
own this gallery.

19:30.386 --> 19:31.779
Don't they?

19:31.822 --> 19:33.781
I've tread carefully, ladies.

19:33.824 --> 19:36.871
You've nothing to gain
by playing hardball

19:36.914 --> 19:39.134
except my antipathy.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.310
And that's something
you don't want.

19:41.354 --> 19:42.703
Believe me.

19:51.146 --> 19:54.018
God, that guy is such a jackass.

19:56.151 --> 19:57.892
His antipathy.

19:57.935 --> 19:59.981
What kind of a jerk.

20:04.028 --> 20:07.075
u have to unfreezehim. You just froze him.

20:07.118 --> 20:08.207
You have to unfreeze him.

20:08.250 --> 20:09.120
Unfrozen!

20:14.430 --> 20:16.954
Do you think we should
hold off on having the party?

20:16.998 --> 20:18.913
Why?

20:18.956 --> 20:22.003
Hmm, so Amber can get a little
more acclimated, maybe?

20:23.526 --> 20:25.920
- Acclimated?
- Yeah.

20:25.963 --> 20:28.357
Honey, she's not a pet.
She can handle a party.

20:28.401 --> 20:30.968
Especially, a small one.
It'll be good.

20:31.012 --> 20:33.232
She can watch Cody, and you
and I will have a good time.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.798
And then she can watch
the baby monitor

20:34.842 --> 20:37.018
after you and I have
had a few drinks.

20:37.061 --> 20:38.541
We deserve this.

20:38.585 --> 20:40.413
- Elise?
- Yeah?

20:40.456 --> 20:42.632
I'm gonna take Cody over
to the swing set now, okay?

20:42.676 --> 20:44.460
Okay, perfect.
I'll see you guys there.

20:46.245 --> 20:47.768
All right, you ready?
Let's race.

20:50.031 --> 20:51.162
- Aw.
- Oh.

20:51.206 --> 20:52.816
Maybe I can get used to this.

20:54.688 --> 20:58.126
Don't get... too used to
this, okay?

20:58.169 --> 21:00.868
"Pale Blue Dot"

21:49.699 --> 21:51.397
Honey. Elise?

21:51.440 --> 21:52.572
- What?
- Everything okay?

21:52.615 --> 21:54.225
Huh? Yeah, everything's fine.

21:54.269 --> 21:55.749
I got us some extra beers.

21:55.792 --> 21:57.185
Well, hand it over
before you warm it up.

21:57.228 --> 21:58.186
Anyway, so I told him,

21:58.229 --> 21:59.361
"You are sitting

21:59.405 --> 22:00.406
on a zillion,

22:00.449 --> 22:02.190
this trillion dollar gold mine

22:02.233 --> 22:03.757
and you're gonna screw it up."

22:03.800 --> 22:05.715
Look, you really think
the ice queen was me...

22:05.759 --> 22:07.064
Who's the ice queen?

22:07.108 --> 22:09.023
It's their boss.
It's so juvenile.

22:09.066 --> 22:10.459
It's Katherine Parsons.

22:10.503 --> 22:12.287
She's the Parsons
of Parsons and Grant.

22:12.331 --> 22:13.854
Okay, why do you call her
the ice queen?

22:13.897 --> 22:15.334
'Cause she's the ice queen.

22:15.377 --> 22:16.944
If you met her,
you would know why.

22:16.987 --> 22:18.989
Maybe you two just can't stand

22:19.033 --> 22:20.730
working for a strong woman.

22:20.774 --> 22:22.558
- Oh, here we go.
- Mm.

22:22.602 --> 22:23.864
- Please, I... Hey.
- I think that's what it is.

22:23.907 --> 22:26.562
I love working
for strong women, okay?

22:26.606 --> 22:28.347
I love working
underneath strong women, too.

22:28.390 --> 22:29.696
But you already know that,
don't you?

22:29.739 --> 22:31.567
I don't know
what you're talking about.

22:31.611 --> 22:34.396
You're filthy and disgusting.
Please move away.

22:34.440 --> 22:37.138
All right.
This is to be continued.

22:37.181 --> 22:39.009
I gotta take a bio break.

22:40.620 --> 22:42.578
Something
I don't need to see.

22:54.503 --> 22:55.678
Hmm.

22:56.418 --> 22:57.724
Whoa.

22:57.767 --> 23:00.248
Who are you?

23:00.291 --> 23:04.557
I said, "Who are you?"

23:04.600 --> 23:06.341
It's an Alice In Wonderland
joke.

23:06.385 --> 23:08.430
It's a caterpillar. The movie.

23:08.474 --> 23:09.910
You didn't see the movie?

23:09.953 --> 23:10.998
You know it wasn't tobacco
that pickle bug

23:11.041 --> 23:12.129
was smoking, right?

23:12.173 --> 23:13.522
- Okay.
- Okay, okay, okay.

23:13.566 --> 23:14.654
Look, I'm sorry.
That was a bad joke.

23:14.697 --> 23:15.959
Who are you, really?

23:16.003 --> 23:17.134
I'm the Simons' new au pair.

23:17.178 --> 23:18.397
Oh, the new au pair.

23:18.440 --> 23:20.268
Hello, new au pair.

23:20.311 --> 23:23.358
I'm the reason your employer's
gonna be a very rich man.

23:23.402 --> 23:24.838
You have really pretty eyes,
you know that?

23:26.405 --> 23:28.363
Wait a minute.

23:28.407 --> 23:29.582
How old are you?

23:29.625 --> 23:31.148
Old enough to know better.

23:31.192 --> 23:32.715
- Move.
- Wow.

23:32.759 --> 23:36.023
That's... nice.

23:39.287 --> 23:40.767
You look better.

23:40.810 --> 23:42.464
Yeah, much better.

23:42.508 --> 23:44.379
I just met your new au pair.

23:44.423 --> 23:45.424
Stay away from her.

23:45.467 --> 23:46.773
She is innocent.

23:48.122 --> 23:49.689
Well, she's not my type.

23:57.523 --> 23:59.568
Hey, Elise?

23:59.612 --> 24:00.743
I just put Cody down.

24:00.787 --> 24:01.788
He had such a busy day

24:01.831 --> 24:03.224
that he fell right asleep.

24:03.267 --> 24:04.965
Thank you.

24:05.008 --> 24:08.751
And I just, I wanted to say,
thank you so much

24:08.795 --> 24:10.971
for everything that you've done
for us so far.

24:11.014 --> 24:12.886
Really, truly, you've been

24:12.929 --> 24:15.192
just absolutely amazing.

24:15.976 --> 24:17.891
So thank you.

24:17.934 --> 24:20.067
You know, take a load off.
Come on, sit down.

24:25.072 --> 24:28.075
You know, Brian was against this
whole thing from the beginning.

24:28.118 --> 24:29.903
Well, to be honest,

24:29.946 --> 24:31.208
I don't know
if I would want a stranger

24:31.252 --> 24:33.297
living in my house, either.

24:33.341 --> 24:35.386
But luckily for me,
a lot of people don't mind.

24:35.430 --> 24:39.129
Well, I think that
we made the right decision.

24:39.173 --> 24:40.783
I really do.

24:40.827 --> 24:43.307
Why don't you go to bed?
You look exhausted.

24:43.351 --> 24:45.875
I'll put the monitor in my room,
just in case he wakes up.

24:45.919 --> 24:49.575
Oh. I'd love that. Thank you.

24:49.618 --> 24:51.838
And you make sure
you get some sleep, too, okay?

24:51.881 --> 24:53.448
Yeah, soon.

24:53.492 --> 24:56.103
I'm a night owl.
It's a hard habit to break.

24:56.146 --> 24:59.454
Oh, um, can you do me
one quick favor?

24:59.498 --> 25:01.543
Will you just lay out
Cody's clothes for tomorrow?

25:01.587 --> 25:02.936
Yeah, sure, of course.

25:02.979 --> 25:04.807
Thank you so much, babe.

25:48.111 --> 25:50.157
Although, no suspects
have been identified,

25:50.200 --> 25:51.854
police say they're making
substantial progress

25:51.898 --> 25:54.248
in the death of Becky Hopkins.

25:54.291 --> 25:55.771
What was once assumed
to be an accidental

25:55.815 --> 25:57.468
overdose on painkillers

25:57.512 --> 25:59.645
is now being treated by police
as a homicide.

25:59.688 --> 26:01.951
- Amber.
- Oh, hi, um...

26:01.995 --> 26:03.866
I'm sorry.

26:03.910 --> 26:05.085
- What were you just watching?
- Uh...

26:05.128 --> 26:06.869
I, I was just watching the news.

26:06.913 --> 26:08.175
It freaks me out,
with everything

26:08.218 --> 26:09.611
that's going on in the world.

26:09.655 --> 26:12.266
Um, you just startled me
when you came in.

26:12.309 --> 26:15.008
- Oh.
- How was your day?

26:15.051 --> 26:17.532
Good. Good, just long.

26:17.576 --> 26:19.099
Busy.

26:19.142 --> 26:22.145
Is, um... Is Cody sleeping?

26:22.189 --> 26:23.973
Yeah, I put him down
about an hour ago.

26:24.017 --> 26:26.497
I think the little man's
getting a cold.

26:26.541 --> 26:27.847
Oh, no.

26:28.630 --> 26:29.892
Um...

26:30.980 --> 26:32.068
What about Elise?

26:32.112 --> 26:33.461
Even before then

26:33.504 --> 26:34.593
she was exhausted.

26:36.507 --> 26:38.161
Well, I guess
I should go join her.

26:38.205 --> 26:40.555
I mean, I know it's late,
but when I get off work,

26:40.599 --> 26:43.558
I, I'm so wired
that I can never sleep.

26:43.602 --> 26:46.648
Must have been such a long day,
so, uh...

26:46.692 --> 26:48.432
You sure you don't want me
to pour you a drink?

26:49.738 --> 26:51.740
A drink?

26:51.784 --> 26:55.135
Well, sure, I guess I can afford
to unwind a little.

26:55.178 --> 26:57.006
Sit down, I'll be right back.

27:20.334 --> 27:21.770
Et voila.

27:21.814 --> 27:23.119
Merci.

27:26.819 --> 27:28.951
Oh, how'd you know
I like scotch on the rocks?

27:28.995 --> 27:31.606
What kinda man doesn't like
scotch on the rocks?

27:31.650 --> 27:33.477
Ooh!

27:33.521 --> 27:36.045
Where'd you learn to pour
such a mean one?

27:36.089 --> 27:37.699
I mean, you're barely legal.

27:37.743 --> 27:39.875
Barely old enough to drink.

27:39.919 --> 27:41.790
Um, my parents weren't wealthy,

27:41.834 --> 27:45.098
so... I had to bartend on
the weekends to pay for college.

27:45.141 --> 27:47.013
Oh.

27:47.056 --> 27:49.232
Sure you don't want one?

27:49.276 --> 27:51.104
I mean, I do, but I shouldn't.

27:51.147 --> 27:52.627
Just in case
Cody wakes up again.

27:52.671 --> 27:54.498
Oh, right, yeah. Of course.

27:55.674 --> 27:58.241
Do you always work so late?

27:58.285 --> 28:00.330
Uh, have been, recently.

28:00.374 --> 28:02.332
Uh, since we landed
that new account.

28:02.376 --> 28:05.205
- You remember the party?
- Oh, I remember.

28:05.248 --> 28:07.250
Oh, right, Vance.

28:07.294 --> 28:09.557
Sure is a character, huh?
I was meaning to apologize.

28:09.600 --> 28:11.211
He told me you guys met,
so I can only imagine

28:11.254 --> 28:13.779
that the, the encounter
was a little less than...

28:13.822 --> 28:16.042
pleasant.

28:16.085 --> 28:18.392
I can take care of myself.

28:18.435 --> 28:21.264
I'm sure you can. You can.

28:21.308 --> 28:23.614
Besides, he's the kinda guy that

28:23.658 --> 28:27.923
women normally find...
interesting.

28:27.967 --> 28:31.274
He's the type of guy that women
normally find to be a dick.

28:32.536 --> 28:34.538
Amber!

28:34.582 --> 28:35.757
I'm sorry,
I shouldn't have said it.

28:35.801 --> 28:36.932
No, no, it's probably true.

28:36.976 --> 28:37.933
I just wasn't expecting to

28:37.977 --> 28:39.152
hear that from you.

28:41.197 --> 28:43.243
Not as innocent as I look.

28:47.421 --> 28:48.683
Huh.

28:49.684 --> 28:50.903
I guess you're not.

28:55.734 --> 28:59.259
Well, I'm all out of scotch,
uh...

28:59.302 --> 29:00.216
Goodnight.

30:41.056 --> 30:43.102
Hey. You awake?

30:45.017 --> 30:46.845
I need to see you right away.

30:47.758 --> 30:50.022
Yeah. It is.

30:52.285 --> 30:53.982
Yeah, I know where that's at.

30:55.157 --> 30:56.898
Well, can you be there?

30:58.857 --> 30:59.814
Okay.

31:00.902 --> 31:02.208
Thanks.

31:13.828 --> 31:16.657
"Make It Hurt"

31:19.312 --> 31:20.574
Thank you.

31:34.980 --> 31:36.851
Thanks for coming.

31:36.895 --> 31:38.592
- Coffee?
- No.

31:38.635 --> 31:40.289
It's the last thing I need.

31:40.333 --> 31:42.161
Can't sleep anyway.

31:42.204 --> 31:43.510
So, what happened?

31:49.472 --> 31:51.257
Is the kid giving you problems?

31:52.562 --> 31:53.868
He's an angel.

31:56.871 --> 31:58.264
The wife?

31:59.352 --> 32:01.006
Jesus, Amber.

32:01.049 --> 32:03.878
- Nothing happened.
- Uh, not yet.

32:03.922 --> 32:05.445
Uh, how many times
do we have to go through...

32:05.488 --> 32:08.665
I know, I know. I know.

32:08.709 --> 32:10.754
Are you still taking
your medication?

32:10.798 --> 32:12.017
Of course.

32:18.588 --> 32:19.850
Maybe you should quit.

32:21.374 --> 32:23.463
Yeah, and do what?

32:23.506 --> 32:25.073
I don't know, something with...

32:25.117 --> 32:26.988
less temptation.

32:27.032 --> 32:28.250
I'm gonna be fine.

32:28.294 --> 32:29.817
I just, um...

32:29.860 --> 32:32.428
Just needed your support,
that's all.

32:35.823 --> 32:37.651
You know you always have that.

32:40.132 --> 32:41.437
Thanks.

32:43.091 --> 32:44.527
I'm so sorry.

32:44.571 --> 32:46.660
I'm being really rude.

32:46.703 --> 32:48.183
How are you?

32:48.227 --> 32:50.272
- I'm fine.
- Where are you living?

32:50.316 --> 32:53.362
I'm still house-sitting
for that one guy.

32:53.406 --> 32:55.625
It's whatever, it's fine.
I mean...

32:55.669 --> 32:57.018
I get the place to myself
most days,

32:57.062 --> 32:59.020
which is pretty cool.

32:59.064 --> 33:00.543
How's the Leopard Lounge?

33:00.587 --> 33:02.371
Oh, the Leopard Lounge.

33:16.429 --> 33:19.649
And you will be compensated
for everything you've done.

33:21.738 --> 33:23.958
I have no idea

33:24.002 --> 33:26.743
how any of this happened.

33:26.787 --> 33:29.181
Virtue Ed wanted
one single person in charge

33:29.224 --> 33:30.573
of handling the account.

33:30.617 --> 33:33.011
They're spending a lot of money.

33:33.054 --> 33:35.926
They wanna know who
the buck stops with.

33:35.970 --> 33:37.754
I know you did as much as Vance.

33:37.798 --> 33:39.887
More, in some respect.

33:39.930 --> 33:42.672
But Vance forged a connection
with these guys.

33:42.716 --> 33:44.892
And I think it's better
if he handles it.

33:46.633 --> 33:48.722
This is my account, Katherine.

33:48.765 --> 33:51.333
This is Parsons and Grant's
account, Brian.

33:53.640 --> 33:55.903
I'm not gonna tell you
how you should feel.

33:55.946 --> 33:58.949
But I'm also not gonna argue
with you about it.

33:58.993 --> 34:01.604
This is an enormous account,

34:01.648 --> 34:04.259
and I am not gonna do anything
to jeopardize it

34:04.303 --> 34:08.306
because one of my employees
might have hurt feelings.

34:08.350 --> 34:11.310
Your employee that was
responsible for the account.

34:11.353 --> 34:14.094
Whose job it was to land it.

34:14.139 --> 34:16.228
I'm not taking this
sitting down, Katherine.

34:16.271 --> 34:18.795
Don't do anything rash, Brian.

34:18.839 --> 34:21.362
You're a very valuable
team member.

34:21.407 --> 34:23.322
You have a great career
ahead of you.

34:23.364 --> 34:25.976
This one didn't go your way.

34:27.021 --> 34:29.632
There'll be others.

34:29.676 --> 34:33.984
I know she's cold and mean,
but the woman is not crazy.

34:34.027 --> 34:35.812
She knows you brought in
this account.

34:35.856 --> 34:37.813
How could she do this?

34:37.858 --> 34:39.425
What do you mean, "How could
she do this?" She's the boss.

34:39.467 --> 34:40.730
She can do whatever she wants.

34:42.862 --> 34:45.779
And Vance?
Vance is okay with this?

34:45.822 --> 34:48.347
When has Vance cared about
anyone other than himself?

34:48.389 --> 34:50.043
Plus, who can blame him?

34:50.088 --> 34:51.915
I blame him.

34:51.958 --> 34:53.612
Oh, a lot of good
that's gonna do.

34:53.656 --> 34:55.223
Where the hell's Amber?

34:55.266 --> 34:56.703
What? She's in her room,
I told her

34:56.746 --> 34:58.008
I wanted to spend time
with Cody.

34:58.052 --> 34:59.967
- Amber!
- Brian... God.

35:01.490 --> 35:03.275
Ah.

35:03.318 --> 35:05.364
You know, I could quit.
Just quit.

35:06.626 --> 35:09.019
Quit? No. No.

35:09.063 --> 35:11.152
You can't quit.

35:11.196 --> 35:15.025
Can you grab Cody? Just take him
to his room or anywhere?

35:15.069 --> 35:17.289
Uh, okay.
Come on, little buddy.

35:17.332 --> 35:18.681
Ready? One, two, three.

35:18.725 --> 35:21.162
- Whoo!
- You tell her.

35:21.206 --> 35:22.903
- Yeah.
- Tell mommy...

35:24.252 --> 35:26.863
Listen, you go back in there

35:26.907 --> 35:29.301
and you tell her
this is your account.

35:31.999 --> 35:34.958
I'm going for a drive. We can
talk about this when I get home.

35:35.002 --> 35:36.221
Wait, Brian!

36:26.923 --> 36:28.273
Ah.

36:31.754 --> 36:33.060
Amber.

36:43.288 --> 36:44.506
Not as innocent
as I thought you were.

37:01.349 --> 37:03.221
Wait, wait.

37:03.264 --> 37:05.310
Elise has been supportive of me.

37:05.353 --> 37:07.703
I don't wanna lose this job.

37:07.747 --> 37:09.531
You're not gonna lose this job.

37:12.230 --> 37:13.535
It's okay.

37:31.727 --> 37:33.251
Whoo!

38:41.710 --> 38:43.059
They're gone.

38:44.844 --> 38:46.062
Amber, whoa!

38:46.106 --> 38:47.673
Whoa, whoa. No, no.

38:47.716 --> 38:49.283
Last night,
that was a huge mistake.

38:49.327 --> 38:50.850
A mistake?

38:50.893 --> 38:52.068
Look, it was good.

38:52.112 --> 38:53.766
It was, it was really good.

38:53.809 --> 38:56.899
But, but...
it can't happen again.

38:56.943 --> 38:58.379
Well, we'll make sure
Elise never finds out.

38:58.423 --> 38:59.859
We'll be really, really careful.

38:59.902 --> 39:01.861
Oh, are you serious?

39:01.904 --> 39:04.124
Look, last night,
I was out of my mind, okay?

39:04.167 --> 39:05.255
Being passed over
for the account

39:05.299 --> 39:06.561
and had a big fight with Elise.

39:06.605 --> 39:07.867
It was the perfect storm,

39:07.910 --> 39:09.390
and you just happened
to be there.

39:09.434 --> 39:11.479
And I can still be here
whenever you want me.

39:11.523 --> 39:13.525
Stop. Amber.

39:13.568 --> 39:15.309
No.

39:15.353 --> 39:16.397
And I have to work.

39:16.441 --> 39:17.746
Please.

40:02.008 --> 40:03.618
Jax?

40:03.662 --> 40:05.011
It's me.

40:06.752 --> 40:09.102
Will you call me
when you can, please?

40:10.538 --> 40:13.149
He, uh...

40:14.324 --> 40:15.630
He...

40:18.067 --> 40:20.156
I...

40:20.200 --> 40:22.289
I just need to talk to you.

40:23.421 --> 40:25.248
Call me back, okay?

40:41.482 --> 40:43.310
Knock, knock.

40:43.353 --> 40:46.487
What?

40:46.531 --> 40:49.098
Don't you think
we should discuss this?

40:49.142 --> 40:50.926
What's there to discuss?

40:54.364 --> 40:57.280
I hate to say this, hombre,

40:57.324 --> 41:00.806
but this attitude of yours,
it kinda feels like sour grapes.

41:00.849 --> 41:03.504
Thank you, Vance. It's exactly
what I needed to hear.

41:03.548 --> 41:06.681
This wasn't my call, bro.

41:06.725 --> 41:09.336
Hey, I want us to ride off in
the sunset together on this one.

41:09.379 --> 41:10.903
But if this is the way
they want, it's my job

41:10.946 --> 41:13.253
to give it to 'em.

41:13.296 --> 41:16.604
Come on. You would've done
the same damn thing.

41:16.648 --> 41:18.476
No, I wouldn't have.

41:23.350 --> 41:25.221
You know what, man?

41:25.265 --> 41:28.486
If that's really true, maybe
that's why you didn't get it.

41:32.272 --> 41:34.274
- Hey, you. How are ya?
- Good.

41:34.317 --> 41:36.581
- You look lovely today.
- Let's go take a chair.

41:36.624 --> 41:39.061
Oh, you gotta be kidding me.

41:39.105 --> 41:40.889
Yo, what's up, baby?

41:40.933 --> 41:43.413
You know how much
money I got?

41:43.457 --> 41:44.850
How much money I got now?

41:44.893 --> 41:47.374
Yes, dude! I'm rich now!

41:49.419 --> 41:52.684
Yeah. Yeah.

41:52.727 --> 41:54.947
Yeah, girl,
why don't you come here?

41:54.990 --> 41:56.949
Yeah. You wanna
take a spin on Vance?

42:01.780 --> 42:02.955
Hm...

42:13.574 --> 42:15.707
Holy ..., man.
I'm ready to go.

42:44.300 --> 42:46.346
Yeah, come on in.

42:46.389 --> 42:47.826
What took you so long?

42:50.698 --> 42:52.613
I said, come in.

42:56.182 --> 42:58.445
Hey, girl, the door is open.

43:00.795 --> 43:02.667
Dude...

43:11.066 --> 43:12.067
What are you doin' here?

43:31.957 --> 43:34.089
- Mr. and Mrs. Simon?
- Yes.

43:34.133 --> 43:37.136
I'm Detective Bennett.
This is Detective Scalese.

43:37.179 --> 43:39.051
We have a few questions for you.

43:39.094 --> 43:41.314
Uh, if you wouldn't mind coming
down to the station with us.

43:41.357 --> 43:43.490
- What's this all about?
- Uh, I'm sure it's nothing.

43:43.533 --> 43:47.494
It's just a couple of questions,
Mrs. Simons. All routine stuff.

43:47.537 --> 43:49.975
Uh, just gonna tell our nanny.
But, of-of course, no problem.

43:54.719 --> 43:56.503
Amber, uh, can you watch Cody?

43:56.546 --> 43:58.157
We're gonna step out
for a few hours.

43:58.200 --> 43:59.680
Okay, Mr. Simon.

44:03.249 --> 44:05.077
Alright, let's go.

44:14.216 --> 44:16.958
When was the last time
you saw Mr. Lipton?

44:17.002 --> 44:19.700
Uh... I guess yesterday.

44:19.744 --> 44:21.920
Uh, around five o'clock,
at work.

44:21.963 --> 44:24.923
And he never mentioned
where he was going?

44:24.966 --> 44:25.924
No.

44:27.142 --> 44:28.274
Hm.

44:33.583 --> 44:36.151
Well, he, uh...
As you can see, um,

44:36.195 --> 44:38.980
the two of us lived
very different lives.

44:39.024 --> 44:40.416
Yeah, but you knew.

44:40.460 --> 44:42.288
You knew about his, uh,

44:42.331 --> 44:43.811
extra-curricular activities.

44:45.508 --> 44:48.381
Well, I knew, yeah.

44:48.424 --> 44:51.906
Was there a certain girl
that he saw regularly?

44:51.950 --> 44:53.603
I don't know, maybe someone
he got into an argument with,

44:53.647 --> 44:56.128
a dispute, maybe?

44:56.171 --> 44:57.651
I don't know any details
like that.

44:57.695 --> 44:59.131
You know, Vance and I
were friends,

44:59.174 --> 45:01.960
but, but we weren't that close.

45:02.003 --> 45:03.613
I knew he liked
to drink and party,

45:03.657 --> 45:06.138
and it doesn't
surprise me at all

45:06.181 --> 45:08.488
that he hired prostitutes.

45:08.531 --> 45:10.882
But, um, we've worked together
for years

45:10.925 --> 45:12.710
and it never
affected his work, so.

45:14.755 --> 45:17.062
This was taken
by the security camera

45:17.105 --> 45:19.499
at the gas station
down the block.

45:19.542 --> 45:21.762
That's as clear
as we can get it.

45:21.806 --> 45:23.851
Any chance you recognize
the figure in that picture?

45:26.245 --> 45:28.551
No. I have no idea who that is.

45:28.595 --> 45:31.119
As you probably know, Mr. Lipton
had no immediate family.

45:31.163 --> 45:34.993
So we spoke to your boss,
Mrs., um...

45:35.036 --> 45:37.647
Parsons. Katherine Parsons.

45:37.691 --> 45:40.346
Right. Mrs. Parsons.

45:40.389 --> 45:43.392
She told us that, uh, there was
quite a bit of friction

45:43.436 --> 45:45.438
between the two of you, lately.

45:49.268 --> 45:50.704
I see where you're going
with this.

45:50.748 --> 45:52.488
Uh, let me just explain, okay?

45:52.532 --> 45:55.840
Uh, we were working to land
this big account,

45:55.883 --> 45:59.539
and, uh, he got all the credit,
but I deserve the credit.

45:59.582 --> 46:03.543
So I was, am pissed.

46:04.936 --> 46:07.025
Ah... You guys do this everyday.

46:07.068 --> 46:10.158
I mean, do I look like
a murderer to you?

47:27.670 --> 47:28.846
What the hell are you doing?

47:28.889 --> 47:30.064
Just making sure you're okay.

47:30.108 --> 47:31.936
I'm fine, thank you.

47:31.979 --> 47:33.851
You don't seem fine.

47:36.244 --> 47:38.768
Ah!

47:38.812 --> 47:40.422
We talked about this.

47:40.466 --> 47:42.511
We can't do this anymore.

47:42.555 --> 47:43.861
And if you don't
understand that, then...

47:43.904 --> 47:45.645
Then what?

47:45.688 --> 47:48.126
- You're gonna let me go?
- I didn't say that.

47:48.169 --> 47:50.432
Because you'd be
really sorry, Brian.

47:50.476 --> 47:51.956
You'd be really, really, sorry.

47:51.999 --> 47:53.783
What?

47:53.827 --> 47:56.961
- What'd you do?
- Well, let's see.

47:57.004 --> 48:00.138
I mean, other than tell Elise,
obviously.

48:00.181 --> 48:02.357
And I know it would be
my word against hers,

48:02.401 --> 48:05.360
but considering what's happened
in your past,

48:05.404 --> 48:07.536
I wonder who she would believe.

48:07.580 --> 48:09.930
How did you know about that?

48:09.974 --> 48:12.324
Brian, you have a really
nice house.

48:12.367 --> 48:14.717
But it's got very thin walls.

48:14.761 --> 48:16.241
Amber...

48:16.284 --> 48:18.504
I don't understand
why you're so upset.

48:18.547 --> 48:21.115
I clean your house, I take
such good care of your son,

48:21.159 --> 48:23.335
and I come with benefits.

48:23.378 --> 48:25.772
It's a total package.

48:25.815 --> 48:29.950
And one day, we can be together,
for real.

48:33.258 --> 48:34.694
Whoo!

48:34.737 --> 48:38.959
Amber... I'm going to bed now.

48:39.003 --> 48:40.830
I suggest you do the same.

49:00.981 --> 49:02.983
I know this is hard
to understand,

49:03.027 --> 49:04.854
but whether or not he has the
right to have you evicted or not

49:04.898 --> 49:06.378
is almost beside the point.

49:06.421 --> 49:07.988
There are lot of clauses
in your original lease

49:08.032 --> 49:09.555
that would trigger in the event
the property is sold.

49:09.598 --> 49:11.296
Now, that doesn't mean
that this is useless,

49:11.339 --> 49:12.601
but it does mean
that you should treat him

49:12.645 --> 49:13.863
as a little more
than a nuisance.

49:13.907 --> 49:15.430
Okay, we just sue the bastard.

49:15.474 --> 49:17.215
There's nothing
to sue him for, yet.

49:17.258 --> 49:19.260
You have to be able to claim
some kinda damages.

49:19.304 --> 49:21.088
Which is probably why he's still
trying to make you an offer,

49:21.132 --> 49:22.960
because the lawsuit would just
delay his plans.

49:23.003 --> 49:26.267
Hm. Okay. But he threatened us.

49:26.311 --> 49:29.401
Writing a strongly-worded letter
isn't exactly actionable.

49:31.490 --> 49:34.493
- Cody.
- Is that my baby? Hi!

49:34.536 --> 49:36.582
Sorry to interrupt.
Did I come too early?

49:36.625 --> 49:38.801
Uh, no. We're about done here.

49:38.845 --> 49:42.457
Um, Amber, this is our lawyer,
Chalfie Prescott.

49:42.501 --> 49:44.329
Chalfie, this is
my new au pair, Amber.

49:44.372 --> 49:45.765
Pleasure.

49:45.808 --> 49:47.027
Well, if it's gonna
take a while,

49:47.071 --> 49:48.333
I can take Cody
to the park or somewhere

49:48.376 --> 49:49.551
and then come back later.

49:49.595 --> 49:51.205
Uh, no, no. I wa-I wanna join.

49:51.249 --> 49:53.033
Uh, we're,
we're wrapping up. So...

49:53.077 --> 49:55.644
Just two minutes? Okay.

49:55.688 --> 49:58.821
All right, so...
what do we do now?

49:58.865 --> 50:01.737
You don't do anything. We wait
until he makes the first move.

50:01.781 --> 50:03.348
I don't think he'll do anything.
He's trying to scare you.

50:03.391 --> 50:05.132
Get you to do something rash.

50:05.176 --> 50:06.568
In the meantime,
I'll talk to Eddie.

50:06.612 --> 50:07.743
He knows people
in the city council.

50:07.787 --> 50:08.744
I can find out what's being said

50:08.788 --> 50:10.311
behind the scenes.

50:10.355 --> 50:12.270
Okay. I'll let you guys
finish up here.

50:12.313 --> 50:13.619
I'm gonna get going.

50:13.662 --> 50:17.188
Um, Chalfie,
thank you as always.

50:17.231 --> 50:19.103
You are the best.

50:20.321 --> 50:22.149
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

50:23.194 --> 50:25.544
Have fun.

50:25.587 --> 50:29.678
Bye, Cody. See you later.

50:29.722 --> 50:32.246
Yeah, you got it all back.
Let's go, let's go.

50:34.988 --> 50:36.903
She's adorable.

50:36.946 --> 50:39.079
I'm surprised Elise allowed
that, if you want my opinion.

50:39.123 --> 50:42.604
Yeah. Brian screwed up, but he's
still one of the good ones.

50:42.648 --> 50:44.171
Honey, if I've learned
one thing,

50:44.215 --> 50:45.738
it's that there are
no more good ones.

50:45.781 --> 50:47.827
Oh. Maybe not for you.

51:16.551 --> 51:18.205
Yeah.

51:21.643 --> 51:23.645
What... Lori?

51:24.298 --> 51:26.039
Lori?

51:26.083 --> 51:28.128
Lori, slow down. Slow down.

51:28.172 --> 51:30.739
I can't, I can't hear a word
you're saying, babe.

51:34.134 --> 51:35.440
What?

51:38.138 --> 51:41.054
Okay. Okay. All right, relax.
I'll be right there.

51:41.098 --> 51:43.448
I'm on my way, okay?

51:43.491 --> 51:45.972
It's all right.
I'll be right there. Okay.

51:46.015 --> 51:48.670
What happened?

51:48.714 --> 51:51.934
The gallery was vandalized.

51:51.978 --> 51:53.806
- What? When?
- I don't know.

51:53.849 --> 51:56.548
This morning,
a jogger was jogging by,

51:56.591 --> 51:58.811
saw the glass on the sidewalk,
called the police.

51:58.854 --> 52:01.205
Lori's there waiting now.

52:01.248 --> 52:03.468
Well, did the police say
who did it or why?

52:03.511 --> 52:07.559
No. But I know why,
and I know who.

52:07.602 --> 52:09.865
- I'm coming with you.
- What? No, no, no, no, no.

52:09.909 --> 52:11.258
Get some sleep.
You need rest, okay?

52:11.302 --> 52:12.694
It's okay.

52:14.218 --> 52:16.089
It's all right. I got it.

52:26.012 --> 52:27.187
Now, you said you had
a business dispute

52:27.231 --> 52:28.580
with Mr. Dutros.

52:28.623 --> 52:31.017
No, not a dispute.

52:31.060 --> 52:34.238
He wanted this space to build
condos. He's a developer.

52:34.281 --> 52:38.372
But because of our lease,
he needed our agreement to sell.

52:38.416 --> 52:41.810
This man's beef, was it with
the both of you or just one?

52:41.854 --> 52:45.162
Both. We're 50-50.
We-we own this together.

52:45.205 --> 52:47.120
And, you know,
he's so condescending.

52:47.164 --> 52:49.209
When he comes in here,
he doesn't even know

52:49.253 --> 52:50.515
who is who.

52:50.558 --> 52:52.778
- Why?
- The epitaph.

52:52.821 --> 52:55.389
- "Whore." It's singular.
- Mm-hmm.

52:55.433 --> 52:57.086
Like he was just
addressing one of you.

52:57.130 --> 52:59.567
Or he was trying to trick us.

52:59.611 --> 53:02.222
- To trick you.
- It's possible.

53:02.266 --> 53:04.355
But, ma'am, I've seen
a lot of crimes like this.

53:04.398 --> 53:06.531
- You know what...
- It's spur-of-the-moment stuff.

53:06.574 --> 53:08.576
It just doesn't seem likely
that the perpetrator would

53:08.620 --> 53:11.057
break into this gallery,
cause all this damage,

53:11.100 --> 53:13.364
and then leave a cryptic message
for investigators.

53:13.407 --> 53:16.628
This looks like it was done
in a fit of rage.

53:16.671 --> 53:21.241
Okay. So, then,
what do we do now?

53:21.285 --> 53:23.896
Well, we treat all crimes with
the utmost seriousness, ma'am.

53:23.939 --> 53:26.159
Even property ones.
And we'll do the same here.

53:31.686 --> 53:32.644
Hold on a second,
all right?

53:36.691 --> 53:38.302
Yeah, I'm at the junkyard now.

53:38.345 --> 53:40.478
No, I know, I know. Yeah.

53:40.521 --> 53:43.220
Not impressed with the location.

53:43.263 --> 53:45.700
Uh, it might work for condos.

53:47.572 --> 53:50.227
Find out if there's
any room for, uh...

53:50.270 --> 53:52.316
you know, a good deal
on this place.

53:52.359 --> 53:54.187
Let me know as soon as possible.

53:59.845 --> 54:02.761
You must've been a beauty
way back when...

54:09.289 --> 54:11.639
Anybody out there?

54:11.683 --> 54:13.511
Hey!

54:13.554 --> 54:15.164
You hear me?

54:19.865 --> 54:21.693
...punks.

55:07.129 --> 55:09.175
I-I know I'm supposed
to have an answer here, guys,

55:09.218 --> 55:11.090
but I-I don't.

55:17.923 --> 55:19.925
Then, just help me out here,
Mr. Simon.

55:21.100 --> 55:24.321
I've got two murders. Two.

55:24.364 --> 55:26.584
The first, your former partner,
who you not only

55:26.627 --> 55:28.890
had a falling out with
the day before,

55:28.934 --> 55:30.370
but whose death you'll no doubt

55:30.414 --> 55:32.503
profit from professionally.

55:32.546 --> 55:36.724
And the second, a thorn
in the side of your wife?

55:36.768 --> 55:38.073
Who's not just
a pain in the ass,

55:38.117 --> 55:39.553
but an expensive one, as well,

55:39.597 --> 55:41.338
with all the pending litigation.

55:41.381 --> 55:42.774
Do you see
where I'm going with this?

55:42.817 --> 55:44.341
Yeah, I see where you're going.

55:44.384 --> 55:46.212
So what?
You think I killed them?

55:48.519 --> 55:50.608
All right. You know what?
We're done here.

55:52.044 --> 55:54.612
I can go?

55:54.655 --> 55:56.222
Unless there's something
you wanna tell me.

55:56.265 --> 55:58.137
No, there's nothing.

56:02.620 --> 56:04.491
Mr. Simon...

56:04.535 --> 56:06.841
you weren't planning
any family vacations

56:06.885 --> 56:08.626
or business trips out of town,
were you?

56:09.975 --> 56:11.716
You do think I did it.

56:11.759 --> 56:13.544
I didn't say that.

56:13.587 --> 56:15.459
But I've got two murders.

56:16.503 --> 56:17.765
Two.

56:18.766 --> 56:20.594
And one connection.

56:41.310 --> 56:43.225
So, how was it?

56:45.227 --> 56:46.403
Well, it was about
as comfortable

56:46.446 --> 56:48.796
as my annual prostate exam.

56:48.840 --> 56:50.581
Ew. Gross.

56:50.624 --> 56:52.539
That is so gross.

56:52.583 --> 56:55.716
They think I did it. Or at least
have something to do with it.

56:57.675 --> 56:59.328
Can you blame them?

57:00.547 --> 57:02.462
No, I can't.

57:04.029 --> 57:06.161
Elise, uh...

57:10.035 --> 57:11.732
Uh, I gotta tell you something,

57:11.776 --> 57:13.604
and I'm only telling you
because I just want you to...

57:13.647 --> 57:16.041
Amber. She doesn't sleep.

57:17.303 --> 57:19.392
What?

57:19.436 --> 57:22.308
Amber. She doesn't sleep.

57:22.351 --> 57:25.877
Like, there are times
when I've woken up

57:25.920 --> 57:28.140
in the middle of the night,
and I can hear her.

57:29.620 --> 57:33.537
Uh, maybe she can hear you,
too, hm?

57:33.580 --> 57:36.540
Brian, I'm being serious.

57:36.583 --> 57:38.933
No, I'm being serious right now.
Listen. Listen.

57:38.977 --> 57:40.239
There are times
when I've woken up

57:40.282 --> 57:41.458
in the middle
of the night, okay?

57:41.501 --> 57:43.285
I've gone and checked on Cody,

57:43.329 --> 57:46.027
I've looked for her,
and she's not even in her room.

57:49.030 --> 57:52.294
Okay. Um, how come we haven't
talked about this before?

57:53.687 --> 57:56.124
I don't know.

57:56.168 --> 57:58.997
Because I'm the one
that pushed for her.

57:59.040 --> 58:01.826
So, I just...

58:01.869 --> 58:03.436
I don't know.

58:05.264 --> 58:06.744
Look, she's not our kid, okay?

58:06.787 --> 58:08.746
So, if she's not on the clock,

58:08.789 --> 58:10.574
she can really do
whatever she wants.

58:11.879 --> 58:13.577
Right.

58:13.620 --> 58:16.667
I know. No, you're right.
You're right.

58:16.710 --> 58:20.409
But... still...

58:20.453 --> 58:22.977
it makes me wonder
if we really vetted her.

58:25.023 --> 58:26.590
I mean, you called her
references, right?

58:26.633 --> 58:28.069
Yes.

58:28.113 --> 58:29.767
You've seen her
playing with Cody.

58:29.810 --> 58:32.509
- She's great.
- Mm-hmm. Mm-hmm.

58:32.552 --> 58:33.901
But if there's something else
that makes you

58:33.945 --> 58:35.337
feel uncomfortable...

58:37.296 --> 58:39.516
I mean, we could let her go.
That's fine, too.

58:42.475 --> 58:44.303
Let me think about it.

58:46.697 --> 58:48.525
Oh. What did you wanna tell me?

58:50.614 --> 58:52.267
What?

58:52.311 --> 58:53.573
Before. I'm so sorry.

58:53.617 --> 58:55.183
- I interrupted you.
- Oh, no, no.

58:55.227 --> 58:57.055
No, you said you were gonna
tell me something,

58:57.098 --> 58:58.535
and I interrupted.
I'm so sorry. What was it?

58:58.578 --> 58:59.579
We can talk about it
another time.

58:59.623 --> 59:00.972
This is far more important.

59:01.015 --> 59:02.800
- You sure?
- Yeah.

59:10.590 --> 59:13.724
Are you sure
this is a good idea?

59:13.767 --> 59:17.641
Ah. Honey,
I'm not going to confront her.

59:17.684 --> 59:19.599
I just wanna see
where she's going.

59:19.643 --> 59:21.688
I mean, she's probably not even
going anywhere.

59:29.957 --> 59:31.655
See?

59:31.698 --> 59:33.308
- See? I told you.
- Okay, okay, okay.

59:33.352 --> 59:35.615
I told you. I knew it.

59:35.659 --> 59:37.704
She's probably just going to
her car to grab something.

59:37.748 --> 59:39.663
No. No.

59:39.706 --> 59:41.882
Any time it's our turn
to listen for Cody,

59:41.926 --> 59:43.536
is when she leaves.

59:43.580 --> 59:45.016
And then,
she keeps her door shut

59:45.059 --> 59:47.061
so we think that she's in there.

59:47.105 --> 59:52.023
Okay.
Just don't be long, please.

59:52.066 --> 59:53.807
I have a meeting with
the ice queen in the morning

59:53.851 --> 59:55.504
about transitioning
to the accounts.

59:55.548 --> 59:57.942
So I wanna get at least
a few hours of sleep.

59:57.985 --> 01:00:00.031
- All right. No, I know. Okay.
- Okay?

01:00:01.249 --> 01:00:02.773
I'll be back, okay?

01:00:02.816 --> 01:00:04.992
- Don't be long.
- I won't.

01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:17.717
Jax!

01:01:43.917 --> 01:01:46.659
I don't understand
why this keeps happening to me!

01:01:46.703 --> 01:01:49.009
They tell me that they love me,
they tell me that they need me.

01:01:49.053 --> 01:01:51.838
Then at the last second,
they change their frickin' mind.

01:01:51.882 --> 01:01:53.710
And I don't know what else
I'm supposed to do.

01:01:53.753 --> 01:01:55.886
- Amber, I just think that...
- All I want is stability!

01:01:55.929 --> 01:01:57.888
I just want a normal life.

01:01:57.931 --> 01:02:00.717
I just want, I just want someone
to love me,

01:02:00.760 --> 01:02:02.457
and to tell me
it's gonna be okay.

01:02:02.501 --> 01:02:05.286
And then he holds me,
and he looks at me like that.

01:02:05.330 --> 01:02:07.506
Well, then, maybe stop
going after married men, Amber.

01:02:07.549 --> 01:02:09.334
I don't know what to tell you.

01:02:39.886 --> 01:02:41.758
What did you find out?

01:02:42.846 --> 01:02:44.195
Um...

01:02:46.501 --> 01:02:48.721
Nothing. You were right.

01:02:48.765 --> 01:02:51.855
She was, um,
just visiting a friend.

01:02:53.247 --> 01:02:54.553
See?

01:03:34.332 --> 01:03:36.464
Yeah?

01:03:36.508 --> 01:03:38.597
I am so sorry
to have bothered you.

01:03:38.640 --> 01:03:40.642
Little late for that.

01:03:42.993 --> 01:03:45.778
I, um, I'd like to ask you
some questions

01:03:45.822 --> 01:03:48.259
about a friend of yours,
if that's okay.

01:03:50.304 --> 01:03:52.872
Depends on what and which.

01:03:52.916 --> 01:03:55.048
It's about Amber Deschanel.

01:03:56.833 --> 01:04:00.140
Oh. Oh, you're the woman
she's working for.

01:04:00.184 --> 01:04:03.013
The one with the kid,
sexy husband.

01:04:03.056 --> 01:04:04.884
Um...

01:04:06.799 --> 01:04:08.105
Please.

01:04:08.148 --> 01:04:09.671
I promise, I won't take more

01:04:09.715 --> 01:04:11.543
than a few minutes of your time.

01:04:16.243 --> 01:04:17.679
Come on in.

01:04:29.082 --> 01:04:30.997
Take a seat.

01:04:36.524 --> 01:04:39.049
So, what do you wanna know?

01:04:39.092 --> 01:04:40.964
How long have you guys been
friends for?

01:04:42.661 --> 01:04:44.184
Listen, if I'm gonna
help you out,

01:04:44.228 --> 01:04:45.969
I think I need to know
why the hell you're here.

01:04:49.146 --> 01:04:51.278
Okay, look.

01:04:51.322 --> 01:04:55.500
I just wanna make sure that
my son is not in any danger.

01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:58.764
That's all.

01:04:58.807 --> 01:05:01.071
Where exactly
do you know Amber from?

01:05:01.114 --> 01:05:02.942
We were in the Oaks,
until I turned 18,

01:05:02.986 --> 01:05:04.726
and she got a foster family.

01:05:04.770 --> 01:05:05.902
The Oaks.

01:05:07.381 --> 01:05:08.992
What, what are the Oaks?

01:05:09.035 --> 01:05:12.691
Carnation Oaks. The orphanage.

01:05:12.734 --> 01:05:15.737
Of course, they don't call it
that these days.

01:05:15.781 --> 01:05:17.522
Wait, so, Amber didn't
have a family?

01:05:17.565 --> 01:05:19.306
She did.

01:05:19.350 --> 01:05:22.788
They died in a car crash
when she was 12.

01:05:22.831 --> 01:05:26.531
And she wasn't pleased
with the foster family.

01:05:27.924 --> 01:05:30.622
Sh-she was.

01:05:30.665 --> 01:05:32.276
Amber told me
that she told you all of this

01:05:32.319 --> 01:05:34.191
before you hired her.

01:05:35.801 --> 01:05:38.456
Mmm, no. No.

01:05:38.499 --> 01:05:40.893
No, she didn't.

01:05:40.937 --> 01:05:43.722
There was...

01:05:43.765 --> 01:05:46.943
an issue between her
and her foster dad.

01:05:49.336 --> 01:05:51.208
He took advantage of her.

01:05:53.253 --> 01:05:55.647
Let's just say,
they had a relationship

01:05:55.690 --> 01:05:58.128
that wasn't conducive to him

01:05:58.171 --> 01:06:00.043
staying her foster dad.

01:06:03.089 --> 01:06:04.569
Oh, my God.

01:06:09.878 --> 01:06:11.663
Thank you, Jax.

01:06:11.706 --> 01:06:13.970
You've been incredibly helpful.

01:06:14.013 --> 01:06:16.885
Look, you gotta understand.

01:06:16.929 --> 01:06:19.845
I love her like a sister.

01:06:19.888 --> 01:06:23.327
But when
kids are involved, it...

01:06:23.370 --> 01:06:25.068
It's just with all the crap
that we've been through,

01:06:25.111 --> 01:06:28.201
I, I figured
you deserved to know.

01:06:28.245 --> 01:06:30.943
Well, I can't tell you how much
I really appreciate it.

01:06:30.987 --> 01:06:33.598
Thank you. And no worries.

01:06:33.641 --> 01:06:35.382
I won't say a word to her
about this, okay?

01:06:38.864 --> 01:06:40.387
You better not.

01:06:43.086 --> 01:06:45.088
I just want what's best for her.

01:06:46.524 --> 01:06:48.091
I understand.

01:10:26.309 --> 01:10:29.137
Hold on one second. Honey?

01:10:29.181 --> 01:10:30.269
- Brian?
- Can this wait?

01:10:30.313 --> 01:10:31.488
I'm in the middle of something.

01:10:31.531 --> 01:10:32.619
But... No, no.

01:10:32.663 --> 01:10:34.273
This absolutely cannot wait.

01:10:34.317 --> 01:10:35.492
Okay.

01:10:35.535 --> 01:10:36.884
What's wrong?

01:10:36.928 --> 01:10:38.408
- Is Cody okay?
- Uh...

01:10:38.451 --> 01:10:40.323
He's with Amber.

01:10:40.366 --> 01:10:45.023
But, Brian... she's not right.

01:10:45.066 --> 01:10:48.156
She's not.
I had... I had this...

01:10:48.200 --> 01:10:50.681
bad feeling, and I-I don't know.

01:10:50.724 --> 01:10:52.813
I-I called her references again,

01:10:52.857 --> 01:10:55.903
the one that I originally
spoke to.

01:10:55.947 --> 01:10:57.905
It's not a real person, Brian.

01:10:57.949 --> 01:11:01.126
- It's a phone in her room.
- What are you talking about?

01:11:01.169 --> 01:11:02.954
You said you had a conversation
with the family.

01:11:02.997 --> 01:11:05.739
I did, but they called me back.

01:11:05.783 --> 01:11:08.568
So Amber probably heard
the message from her

01:11:08.612 --> 01:11:11.658
secret second phone,
and had one of her friends call

01:11:11.702 --> 01:11:14.705
pretending to be, you know,
Mr. or Mrs. Whoever

01:11:14.748 --> 01:11:16.620
from the resume
that she gave us.

01:11:16.663 --> 01:11:18.056
Okay, where is she now?

01:11:18.099 --> 01:11:20.145
At the park. It's still...
I don't know.

01:11:20.188 --> 01:11:22.452
Look, can you just,
please, come home?

01:11:22.495 --> 01:11:24.367
Okay. You stay right there, I'm
gonna be home as quick as I can.

01:11:24.410 --> 01:11:26.456
Okay, all right. Thank you.

01:11:26.499 --> 01:11:27.848
Bye.

01:11:42.602 --> 01:11:43.995
Good job.

01:11:48.521 --> 01:11:50.958
Hey. You guys have a good day?

01:11:51.002 --> 01:11:54.353
We did, but I think this
little one is ready for a nap.

01:11:54.397 --> 01:11:56.355
- Aw, come here.
- It's okay, I can put him down.

01:11:56.399 --> 01:11:57.617
No, I'll take him.

01:11:57.661 --> 01:11:59.924
Oh, okay.

01:11:59.967 --> 01:12:01.621
Oh.

01:12:01.665 --> 01:12:02.796
Mwah.

01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:04.102
Mommy missed you.

01:12:18.508 --> 01:12:21.859
- I don't need to call it, do I?
- Elise, I can explain.

01:12:21.902 --> 01:12:25.210
Look, whatever pathetic lie that
you are about to come up with

01:12:25.253 --> 01:12:27.647
right now, you can save it,
I don't wanna hear it.

01:12:27.691 --> 01:12:29.997
'Cause the police
are on their way.

01:12:30.041 --> 01:12:31.782
The police?

01:12:31.825 --> 01:12:35.438
Look, whatever sick,
twisted reason you had

01:12:35.481 --> 01:12:38.049
for killing
Vance and George Dutros,

01:12:38.092 --> 01:12:39.616
you can tell them.

01:12:39.659 --> 01:12:41.182
Elise, I don't know
what you're thinking,

01:12:41.226 --> 01:12:43.489
but I had nothing
to do with that.

01:12:43.533 --> 01:12:46.013
I lied about my experiences,
that's true,

01:12:46.057 --> 01:12:48.407
because I-I knew I'd-I'd be
really good at it.

01:12:48.451 --> 01:12:50.583
And-and I was, and I knew that
you wouldn't hire me

01:12:50.627 --> 01:12:53.499
unless I embellished the parts.

01:12:53.543 --> 01:12:57.198
Look, it's not use, Amber.
You're going to jail.

01:12:57.242 --> 01:12:58.939
Get out of my way.

01:12:58.983 --> 01:13:00.854
You're not going anywhere.

01:13:00.898 --> 01:13:03.727
Come on, Elise,
I do not wanna hurt you.

01:13:03.770 --> 01:13:06.512
Oh, honey, I'm not the one
that's gonna be hurting here.

01:13:19.438 --> 01:13:21.440
Ahh! Uhh!

01:14:16.016 --> 01:14:17.975
Oh, you're not getting away
that easy

01:14:18.018 --> 01:14:20.238
after all that you've done.

01:14:25.286 --> 01:14:27.985
Elise! Elise! Wait. Stop.

01:14:28.028 --> 01:14:29.552
What are you doing? Elise...

01:14:29.595 --> 01:14:31.554
Let me go! No. Brian, no!

01:14:31.597 --> 01:14:33.773
Brian, she killed them.
She killed them all.

01:14:33.817 --> 01:14:36.602
- She killed them all...
- Calm down. Calm down. Hey!

01:14:40.301 --> 01:14:41.999
Where... where is she?

01:14:42.042 --> 01:14:44.349
Where did she go?

01:14:50.964 --> 01:14:52.357
I know you're both
very anxious

01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.185
to put all this behind you,

01:14:54.228 --> 01:14:55.926
but please understand,
as this investigation goes on

01:14:55.969 --> 01:14:57.362
we're gonna have more questions.

01:14:57.405 --> 01:14:58.885
Okay.

01:14:58.929 --> 01:15:01.322
So, e-everything that
she told us,

01:15:01.366 --> 01:15:04.500
from her-her background
to her college,

01:15:04.543 --> 01:15:06.545
it was all a lie?

01:15:06.589 --> 01:15:07.807
Yeah.

01:15:07.851 --> 01:15:11.202
A lot of it, yes.

01:15:11.245 --> 01:15:14.553
And there's no question at all
that she was the...

01:15:14.597 --> 01:15:16.599
Officially, the investigation
is still ongoing,

01:15:16.642 --> 01:15:18.339
but there's no reason
to believe it was anyone

01:15:18.383 --> 01:15:20.951
other than her in those
surveillance videos.

01:15:20.994 --> 01:15:22.561
That coupled with her behavior,

01:15:22.605 --> 01:15:24.955
uh, unless something else drops,

01:15:24.998 --> 01:15:26.609
we've found our woman.

01:15:29.046 --> 01:15:32.266
Look, there's still a lot that
we don't know...

01:15:32.310 --> 01:15:34.007
that we may never know.

01:15:34.051 --> 01:15:37.576
But I think for now
we have to accept the obvious

01:15:37.620 --> 01:15:40.144
that Amber Deschanel was
a deeply disturbed individual.

01:15:40.187 --> 01:15:42.494
And you really think
you're gonna find her?

01:15:42.538 --> 01:15:45.105
That I can promise you,
Mrs. Simon,

01:15:45.149 --> 01:15:47.151
she'll turn up sooner or later.

01:15:47.194 --> 01:15:48.544
Sooner, I'm sure.

01:15:50.241 --> 01:15:52.548
Okay, good. Yep.

01:15:59.772 --> 01:16:02.558

01:17:09.450 --> 01:17:10.538
Ahh!

01:17:25.553 --> 01:17:26.250
So, now you know.

01:17:30.776 --> 01:17:33.779
Oh. Yeah...

01:17:36.347 --> 01:17:40.656
This really turned out to be
a nice touch.

01:17:40.699 --> 01:17:43.397
Well, because I knew even you
couldn't overlook

01:17:43.441 --> 01:17:45.182
something so obvious.

01:17:47.271 --> 01:17:48.925
But why?

01:17:48.968 --> 01:17:53.451
Because the first time I decided
to take you back,

01:17:53.494 --> 01:17:57.324
it was because nothing
was more important to me

01:17:57.368 --> 01:17:59.892
than preserving our family.

01:17:59.936 --> 01:18:02.460
And the ones
who stood in the way...

01:18:02.503 --> 01:18:06.682
well, they needed to be
dealt with.

01:18:06.725 --> 01:18:08.553
So-so, you...

01:18:08.596 --> 01:18:11.817
But, but... Vance?

01:18:11.861 --> 01:18:15.081
Oh, come on, Brian,
don't be so naive.

01:18:15.125 --> 01:18:17.518
Vance was a piece of garbage

01:18:17.562 --> 01:18:20.739
living on bar time with
all the drinking and drugs.

01:18:20.783 --> 01:18:23.568
And don't try to tell me that
that wasn't your account.

01:18:23.611 --> 01:18:26.397
That was your account.

01:18:26.440 --> 01:18:29.400
And George Dutros got exactly
what was coming to him.

01:18:35.449 --> 01:18:38.235
Becky Hopkins...

01:18:38.278 --> 01:18:43.327
did you really think that I was just gonna let it go? Huh?

01:18:43.370 --> 01:18:44.807
That I was just
gonna get over it?

01:18:44.850 --> 01:18:46.765
The fact that you cheated
on me with her

01:18:46.809 --> 01:18:48.158
and slept with her?

01:18:49.855 --> 01:18:50.638
Really?

01:18:52.640 --> 01:18:56.122
Well, um, just in case
you were curious,

01:18:56.166 --> 01:18:58.603
the official drug report said
that it was

01:18:58.646 --> 01:19:01.911
an accidental drug overdose.

01:19:01.954 --> 01:19:04.391
Although the painkillers
worked fairly well,

01:19:04.435 --> 01:19:08.308
I must admit, it was, um, tsk,

01:19:08.352 --> 01:19:10.136
quite empowering,

01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:12.748
snuffing the life out
of that woman.

01:19:12.791 --> 01:19:16.969
You know, the only one I
actually felt bad about was Jax.

01:19:17.013 --> 01:19:20.756
Poor girl, she had a rough life.

01:19:20.799 --> 01:19:25.282
But, loose ends, we couldn't
have any loose ends, babe.

01:19:25.325 --> 01:19:27.980
Amber, she took the fall for it.

01:19:28.024 --> 01:19:29.590
I mean, she had her whole life

01:19:29.634 --> 01:19:31.723
in front of her.

01:19:31.767 --> 01:19:34.508
I knew it from the first time
I laid eyes on her.

01:19:34.552 --> 01:19:36.989
She was the perfect,
useful idiot.

01:19:39.426 --> 01:19:40.950
Okay.

01:19:40.993 --> 01:19:44.127
So... what now?

01:19:44.170 --> 01:19:46.042
Now?

01:19:46.085 --> 01:19:48.871
Well, now,
you've got two choices.

01:19:50.307 --> 01:19:52.222
You can call the police.

01:19:52.265 --> 01:19:54.398
I'll go to jail,
you'll be a single father,

01:19:54.441 --> 01:19:57.140
and we'll lose everything.

01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.358
Or...

01:20:02.058 --> 01:20:06.410
we could have
the perfect family...

01:20:06.453 --> 01:20:09.587
okay, the perfect life

01:20:09.630 --> 01:20:11.894
and go take our son on vacation.

01:20:14.374 --> 01:20:16.202
The choice is yours.

01:20:40.705 --> 01:20:42.489
Detective Bennett.

01:20:42.533 --> 01:20:43.839
Thanks for calling.

01:20:43.882 --> 01:20:47.233
- May I?
- So, what do you have for us?

01:20:47.277 --> 01:20:50.671
Well, you'll be happy to know
that I, uh...

01:20:50.715 --> 01:20:54.153
I found this when we were
cleaning out her room,

01:20:54.197 --> 01:20:56.068
and, uh, I thought it looked
like the one on the photo,

01:20:56.112 --> 01:20:57.940
so you might want it.

01:20:57.983 --> 01:20:59.680
Just another piece
of the puzzle.

01:20:59.724 --> 01:21:01.639
Yeah, I guess.

01:21:01.682 --> 01:21:03.075
See ya.

01:21:03.119 --> 01:21:06.035
Mr. Simon, is everything okay?

01:21:06.078 --> 01:21:08.037
Yeah, couldn't be better.

01:21:26.707 --> 01:21:28.840
I do
apologize about not being

01:21:28.884 --> 01:21:33.149
completely honest about my
background, but then again...

01:21:33.192 --> 01:21:36.195
Just one sec.
Hey, judge signed the warrant.

01:21:36.239 --> 01:21:37.936
Backup's on its way,
we got a scoop.

01:21:37.980 --> 01:21:39.895
Let's go get these Simons.

01:21:39.938 --> 01:21:41.548
Oh, we got 'em.

01:21:41.592 --> 01:21:43.159
Yeah, we're on our way.

01:22:08.967 --> 01:22:10.099
Hey.

01:22:11.187 --> 01:22:13.406
Hey.

01:22:13.450 --> 01:22:15.060
- Hi.
- How you doing?

01:22:15.104 --> 01:22:16.453
- Mm.
- Mm. Mm.

01:22:16.496 --> 01:22:20.892
Okay. So, what did they say?

01:22:20.936 --> 01:22:23.982
Not much.
Didn't even seem surprised.

01:22:24.026 --> 01:22:25.331
- That's good.
- That's great.

01:22:25.375 --> 01:22:26.985
That's great.

01:22:27.029 --> 01:22:28.334
- What's that?
- I don't know.

01:22:28.378 --> 01:22:29.770
Is that a little gift for me?

01:22:29.814 --> 01:22:31.424
I found it at the door.

01:22:31.468 --> 01:22:32.860
Where's Cody?

01:22:32.904 --> 01:22:34.471
Uh, he's with the new au pair.

01:22:34.514 --> 01:22:36.212
You want some, uh, wine?

01:22:36.255 --> 01:22:37.996
Yeah, I want some wine.

01:22:45.090 --> 01:22:46.265
Hm.

01:22:53.098 --> 01:22:55.579
Okay.

01:22:55.622 --> 01:22:57.973
- USB?
- Yeah. Interesting.

01:22:58.016 --> 01:22:59.409
- Cheers.
- Cheers, Brian.

01:23:02.151 --> 01:23:03.543
Mm.

01:23:04.631 --> 01:23:06.068
That's good.

01:23:06.111 --> 01:23:07.156
What is this?

01:23:07.199 --> 01:23:09.245
Dear Elise and Brian.

01:23:09.288 --> 01:23:10.855
First of all, I'm gonna tell you

01:23:10.898 --> 01:23:13.510
how much I enjoyed
working for you.

01:23:13.553 --> 01:23:16.861
Despite everything, I don't
think I've ever been happier

01:23:16.904 --> 01:23:21.083
or felt more needed than when
I was taking care of Cody.

01:23:21.126 --> 01:23:23.346
Almost immediately,
I noticed the nanny cam.

01:23:23.389 --> 01:23:24.738
It's a pretty common one.

01:23:24.782 --> 01:23:27.002
You can buy them
at any electronic store.

01:23:27.045 --> 01:23:28.046
And I don't blame you.

01:23:28.090 --> 01:23:29.656
If I had a child of my own

01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:31.615
I'd use one, too.

01:23:31.658 --> 01:23:34.574
I do apologize about not being
completely honest

01:23:34.618 --> 01:23:36.315
about my background,

01:23:36.359 --> 01:23:38.491
but then again if you knew,

01:23:38.535 --> 01:23:40.058
I think we all know
there's no way

01:23:40.102 --> 01:23:41.973
you would've hired me.

01:23:42.017 --> 01:23:45.194
Just needed a chance.

01:23:45.237 --> 01:23:48.936
Anyway, just as you had
your suspicions about me,

01:23:48.980 --> 01:23:51.243
I, too, had them about you.

01:23:51.287 --> 01:23:52.984
Especially after
the murders of Vance

01:23:53.028 --> 01:23:55.639
and that horrible man
from the gallery.

01:23:55.682 --> 01:23:57.467
I could see where things
were going

01:23:57.510 --> 01:23:59.860
and where blame was being laid.

01:23:59.904 --> 01:24:01.906
So I substituted the thumb drive
in the nanny cam

01:24:01.949 --> 01:24:04.039
with one of my own.

01:24:04.082 --> 01:24:07.738
It was weeks before I heard
about Jax's passing.

01:24:07.781 --> 01:24:10.349
In the police report,
two different neighbors

01:24:10.393 --> 01:24:12.221
saw a woman
in a hooded sweatshirt

01:24:12.264 --> 01:24:14.092
leaving her house.

01:24:14.136 --> 01:24:16.268
The date and time of this video

01:24:16.312 --> 01:24:18.227
is within an hour of when
the pathologist said

01:24:18.270 --> 01:24:20.925
she was murdered.

01:24:20.968 --> 01:24:23.928
The DNA found at the crime
scene will be a match,

01:24:23.971 --> 01:24:27.932
I'm sure, to the DNA
of Elise's hair...

01:24:27.975 --> 01:24:29.455
which I sent to the police

01:24:29.499 --> 01:24:31.240
along with this file.

01:24:31.283 --> 01:24:34.373
I don't expect to see either
one of you again soon.

01:24:34.417 --> 01:24:36.114
But give Cody a kiss for me.

01:24:36.158 --> 01:24:39.335
And don't worry, he'll be fine
in the foster system.

01:24:39.378 --> 01:24:42.207
I mean, just look at me.

01:24:48.822 --> 01:24:51.651
