00:02.240 --> 00:03.520
TARA (VOICEOVER): Previously
on "Dance Academy."

00:03.560 --> 00:05.080
-Welcome to first year.

00:05.120 --> 00:07.200
-We will train six days
a week, working harder

00:07.240 --> 00:08.720
than many people
work in a lifetime.

00:08.759 --> 00:10.480
MISS RAINE: This
year, the Academy

00:10.519 --> 00:13.800
has decided to introduce
you to more styles of dance,

00:13.839 --> 00:15.359
not just ballet.

00:15.400 --> 00:18.199
Tara, you and Abigail
are doing private classes

00:18.239 --> 00:19.800
with me every night this week.

00:19.839 --> 00:23.120
-Only favorites get
this kind of attention.

00:23.160 --> 00:25.399
-Oh, I don't know
what to do about Kat.

00:25.440 --> 00:28.640
She has potential, but such a
bad attitude about her dancing.

00:28.679 --> 00:30.480
TARA: I like you too.

00:30.519 --> 00:31.519
But only as a friend.

00:34.399 --> 00:35.560
-A friend.

00:35.600 --> 00:37.799
-There are two types of
girls at the Academy.

00:37.840 --> 00:40.560
Girls who are
serious about ballet,

00:40.600 --> 00:44.399
and girls who have boyfriends.

00:44.439 --> 00:44.759
-Oh!

00:44.799 --> 00:46.479
-Whoa!

00:46.520 --> 00:48.439
-Whoa!

00:48.479 --> 00:48.799
-Whoa!

00:48.840 --> 00:58.320
[cheers]

00:58.359 --> 01:02.399
THEME SONG: Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:02.439 --> 01:05.239
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:05.280 --> 01:11.519
Take a breath, close your eyes.

01:11.560 --> 01:19.120
Take a leap of faith and
lead the way tonight.

01:19.159 --> 01:24.040
This is my chance,
this is my chance.

01:24.079 --> 01:26.840
My chance to feel alive.

01:26.879 --> 01:29.799
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:29.840 --> 01:32.120
Whoa-oh, whoa.

01:54.760 --> 01:57.359
[alarm ringing]

02:10.639 --> 02:14.599
TARA (VOICEOVER): In ballet,
enough is never enough.

02:14.639 --> 02:18.479
Anna Pavlova was one of the
greatest dancers of all time.

02:18.520 --> 02:21.199
But after a performance,
when everyone else

02:21.240 --> 02:25.360
would go out or crawl into bed,
she went back to the studio

02:25.400 --> 02:26.199
to practice.

02:35.080 --> 02:39.039
To be as good as that,
dance has to be your life.

02:39.080 --> 02:43.080
Everything else is
just a distraction.

02:43.120 --> 02:45.800
-Abigail, is that
you under there?

02:45.840 --> 02:47.400
TARA: Sorry?

02:47.439 --> 02:48.680
-Hmm.

02:48.719 --> 02:50.159
Hmm.

02:50.199 --> 02:51.599
Skin's on tight,
but you just don't

02:51.639 --> 02:52.800
know with these shape shifters.

02:52.840 --> 02:53.840
They're so tricky.

02:53.879 --> 02:55.319
-Stop it!

02:55.360 --> 02:56.319
I have to get the brisees
right before tomorrow,

02:56.360 --> 02:57.599
and if I can't get the beats--

02:57.639 --> 02:59.520
-The world as we know
it will fall into chaos!

02:59.560 --> 03:00.199
-Exactly.

03:03.680 --> 03:06.759
-Diminished perspective.

03:06.800 --> 03:07.400
Interesting.

03:18.879 --> 03:21.120
-I hope you're strengthening
the right muscles

03:21.159 --> 03:22.319
with all this cardio.

03:22.360 --> 03:23.800
Beginners don't tend
to realize that there's

03:23.840 --> 03:25.400
no point in having
a tight ITB if--

03:25.439 --> 03:27.280
-And ignoring your
adductors and piriformis?

03:27.319 --> 03:27.879
I know.

03:27.919 --> 03:28.599
I'm being careful.

03:28.639 --> 03:30.400
[piano playing]

03:35.800 --> 03:38.639
-Tomorrow's performance is an
opportunity to show the board

03:38.680 --> 03:41.639
and its patrons that they
are supporting one of the top

03:41.680 --> 03:42.599
training institutions--

03:42.639 --> 03:43.400
-[giggling]

03:43.439 --> 03:44.599
-In the world.

03:44.639 --> 03:48.039
Be aware this is your
most critical audience.

03:48.080 --> 03:49.680
They're educated in ballet.

03:49.719 --> 03:53.439
They expect perfection.

03:53.479 --> 03:54.479
More elevation, Tara.

03:54.520 --> 03:56.800
It will help the beats.

03:56.840 --> 03:57.639
[girl giggling]

04:00.639 --> 04:02.759
-What happened?

04:02.800 --> 04:03.639
-Sorry.

04:03.680 --> 04:04.800
I just got distracted.

04:04.840 --> 04:06.479
-There's no excuse
to lose focus.

04:06.520 --> 04:07.639
-[giggling]

04:07.680 --> 04:09.800
-That applies to the
corps du ballet as much

04:09.840 --> 04:11.599
as the principles.

04:11.639 --> 04:13.560
We'll resume tomorrow.

04:13.599 --> 04:15.840
-Uh, we're not finished yet.

04:15.879 --> 04:17.480
The understudies
haven't run it through.

04:17.519 --> 04:21.480
-We don't have time for
a separate rehearsal.

04:21.519 --> 04:23.399
-It's just, I'm a little
uh, sketchy on what

04:23.439 --> 04:27.319
happens after the um, the jetes.

04:27.360 --> 04:29.600
-You're understudying Sean?

04:29.639 --> 04:30.800
You're across the choreography?

04:30.839 --> 04:31.600
-Yeah.

04:31.639 --> 04:32.759
Across.

04:32.800 --> 04:34.399
On top.

04:34.439 --> 04:36.160
-You have a DVD and 24 hours.

04:36.199 --> 04:37.399
Make good use of it.

04:43.240 --> 04:45.160
-Did you know Anna
Pavlova's dying wish

04:45.199 --> 04:47.519
was to hold her "Swan
Lake" tutu one last time?

04:47.560 --> 04:48.240
-No.

04:48.279 --> 04:50.160
I did not know that.

04:50.199 --> 04:52.480
-Eskimo kiss?

04:52.519 --> 04:53.079
-Oh.

04:53.120 --> 04:54.319
-[giggles]

04:54.360 --> 04:55.800
SAMMY: I believe the
correct term's Inuit.

04:55.839 --> 04:58.160
--[laughs] I thought
it was vomit.

04:58.199 --> 04:59.800
So uh, I'm thinking
about branching out

04:59.839 --> 05:01.800
and interviewing
some new friends.

05:01.839 --> 05:02.800
-There's your mum.

05:02.839 --> 05:04.199
Maybe you can play with her.

05:04.240 --> 05:05.800
MALE BOARD MEMBER: And
yes, I have a problem--

05:05.839 --> 05:06.560
-Uh [clears throat].

05:06.600 --> 05:07.839
Require backup.

05:07.879 --> 05:09.160
NATASHA: It's a complete
waste of time and energy.

05:09.199 --> 05:10.240
They're only students
for three years!

05:10.279 --> 05:11.759
-Well, if that's
your opinion, you

05:11.800 --> 05:13.600
can voice it at the meeting.

05:13.639 --> 05:14.480
-Darling!

05:14.519 --> 05:15.600
-Uh, you're early.

05:15.639 --> 05:18.439
I thought the board
thingy was tomorrow.

05:18.480 --> 05:20.560
-Oh, is it so terrible
to see your mother?

05:20.600 --> 05:21.600
Hello, Tara.

05:21.639 --> 05:24.399
-Well, I usually
like to prepare.

05:24.439 --> 05:26.720
-Uh sweetheart, talk me
through what you're wearing.

05:26.759 --> 05:28.079
-Oh we have Hip Hop next.

05:28.120 --> 05:29.319
-Oh, good.

05:29.360 --> 05:32.160
I thought you were
trying to look ugly.

05:32.199 --> 05:33.639
-[laughs sarcastically]

05:38.560 --> 05:40.120
[hip hop music playing]

05:40.160 --> 05:41.639
INSTRUCTOR: I don't
care if you cheat,

05:41.680 --> 05:43.639
just make it work for you.

05:46.680 --> 05:47.319
Yeah!

05:57.199 --> 05:58.240
Keep breathing.

06:03.720 --> 06:05.199
Nice!

06:05.240 --> 06:06.600
Sammy, show me what you got.

06:10.600 --> 06:11.480
'Scuse me?

06:11.519 --> 06:13.639
Where did that come from?

06:13.680 --> 06:15.639
All right, you all
get out of here.

06:15.680 --> 06:17.800
But bring it tomorrow.

06:17.839 --> 06:18.800
[applause]

06:18.839 --> 06:20.240
INSTRUCTOR: Nice work.

06:20.279 --> 06:21.639
-Whoo, whoo, whoo, whoo!

06:21.680 --> 06:22.680
-Sammy.

06:22.720 --> 06:24.240
They're gonna be in awe, man.

06:24.279 --> 06:24.600
-Sweet.

06:24.639 --> 06:25.319
Thanks.

06:25.360 --> 06:28.319
-All good.

06:28.360 --> 06:29.680
-Hello you.

06:29.720 --> 06:31.319
See that?

06:31.360 --> 06:32.399
-Mm hmm.

06:32.439 --> 06:34.639
But I don't do other
people's armpits.

06:45.879 --> 06:48.480
GIRL 1: [giggling] No way!

06:48.519 --> 06:49.800
Once you've said it--

06:49.839 --> 06:51.319
GIRL 2: You can't take it back!

06:51.360 --> 06:52.759
-He promised to
teach us to skate!

06:52.800 --> 06:54.199
-Tell him he has to!

06:54.240 --> 06:55.360
-He's got his own voice.

06:57.839 --> 06:58.800
-OK.

06:58.839 --> 06:59.800
[girls squeal]

06:59.839 --> 07:01.399
GIRL 1: Give me that!

07:01.439 --> 07:02.360
-[giggles]

07:05.199 --> 07:08.839
--[sighs] Too many
to choose from?

07:08.879 --> 07:11.199
--[sighs] Seems you
have a similar problem.

07:13.879 --> 07:15.160
GIRL 2: Christian!

07:24.839 --> 07:28.399
[piano playing]

08:07.519 --> 08:10.240
SAMMY: OK.

08:10.279 --> 08:13.639
It's your turn to watch my solo.

08:13.680 --> 08:15.680
-I'm not the
authority on hip hop.

08:15.720 --> 08:16.800
-No, ballet.

08:16.839 --> 08:18.279
I want your honest appraisal.

08:20.680 --> 08:23.480
-My honest appraisal is that
you don't have a ballet solo.

08:23.519 --> 08:24.800
-[laughs] I do though.

08:24.839 --> 08:26.160
I'm second cast to Sean.

08:29.560 --> 08:31.560
-I don't think he's
planning on getting injured.

08:31.600 --> 08:33.600
-Yeah well, no one plans
on getting injured.

08:37.360 --> 08:40.480
Look, tomorrow's
rehearsal's my last chance

08:40.519 --> 08:43.120
to show Miss Raine that I'm
more than just an understudy.

08:43.159 --> 08:45.399
So when she's casting again,
she knows what I can do.

08:47.679 --> 08:49.320
-She's been teaching
us all year.

08:49.360 --> 08:54.240
You should probably accept
where she's put you.

08:54.279 --> 08:55.440
-You?

08:55.480 --> 08:57.639
Of all people, you're
telling me not to try?

08:57.679 --> 08:59.799
-There's nothing wrong
with being an understudy.

08:59.840 --> 09:00.639
-Yeah.

09:00.679 --> 09:01.159
For me, you mean.

09:06.720 --> 09:08.200
-You asked me to be honest.

09:08.240 --> 09:09.759
How am I the bad guy?

09:21.279 --> 09:24.600
MISS RAINE: Get
in line, everyone.

09:24.639 --> 09:27.480
I need you to watch the
space between yourself

09:27.519 --> 09:30.240
and the next person
and maintain it

09:30.279 --> 09:34.759
as though your
life depends on it.

09:34.799 --> 09:39.399
[music playing]

09:50.720 --> 09:52.320
-[giggles]

10:07.200 --> 10:08.440
SAMMY: Sorry, Sean.

10:08.480 --> 10:10.279
-What are you doing?

10:10.320 --> 10:13.600
-I needed a proper run through
to feel properly prepared.

10:13.639 --> 10:15.039
-It's distracting.

10:15.080 --> 10:16.480
Go to the side.

10:16.519 --> 10:20.200
I only want to see people
who are dancing this evening.

10:20.240 --> 10:21.200
From the beginning.

10:23.840 --> 10:24.440
Again.

10:27.440 --> 10:30.360
[music playing]

10:38.519 --> 10:40.559
-Have you all lost
the ability to count?

10:52.240 --> 10:54.159
Abigail, eyes off the mirror!

10:54.200 --> 10:57.600
Your vanity astounds me.

10:57.639 --> 10:59.600
[girl giggling]

10:59.639 --> 11:00.720
-Tara, are you with us?

11:07.360 --> 11:07.720
[music stops]

11:12.679 --> 11:14.600
-Rehearsal's over.

11:14.639 --> 11:17.720
I'm sick of the sight of you.

11:17.759 --> 11:19.519
Please take some
time this afternoon

11:19.559 --> 11:24.080
to focus your energy
and concentration.

11:24.120 --> 11:26.080
Then come back ready to dance.

11:26.120 --> 11:27.799
-Miss Raine, surely the
principles can stay--

11:27.840 --> 11:28.480
-Out!

12:01.679 --> 12:03.120
-What are you doing?

12:03.159 --> 12:05.320
-What are you doing?

12:05.360 --> 12:07.080
-We were given
the afternoon off.

12:07.120 --> 12:10.799
-Yeah, to rehearse
for the showcase.

12:10.840 --> 12:12.799
-This is an intervention, Tara.

12:12.840 --> 12:14.120
-Ballet fever.

12:14.159 --> 12:15.559
Worst case I've
ever seen, actually.

12:15.600 --> 12:16.799
-[laughs] Come on!

12:16.840 --> 12:19.799
-Ballet fever is
defined as the inability

12:19.840 --> 12:21.360
to do anything
apart from ballet.

12:21.399 --> 12:24.440
-The inability to discuss
anything apart from ballet.

12:24.480 --> 12:26.840
-The inability to think about
anything apart from ballet.

12:26.879 --> 12:29.480
-Now there is a whole
wold out there, Tara.

12:29.519 --> 12:30.159
Things to do.

12:30.200 --> 12:31.559
-I have a life.

12:31.600 --> 12:32.600
I do things.

12:32.639 --> 12:33.799
-Oh, really?

12:33.840 --> 12:35.639
Well, uh, name one thing
in the past few weeks

12:35.679 --> 12:37.279
that hasn't involved ballet.

13:05.399 --> 13:07.759
-You're rolling forward
on your right foot.

13:07.799 --> 13:10.120
-Did they send you to spy on me?

13:10.159 --> 13:11.360
-Yes, training bra.

13:11.399 --> 13:14.120
Because the whole world
revolves around you.

13:17.440 --> 13:18.399
Go on.

13:21.639 --> 13:26.080
-So um, where's the other
half of your relationship?

13:26.120 --> 13:27.200
-She's uh--

13:27.240 --> 13:28.279
-She won't be wanting
your lips back?

13:28.320 --> 13:30.480
-Um, busy.

13:30.519 --> 13:32.240
-Oh, trouble is there?

13:32.279 --> 13:34.159
In your relationship?

13:34.200 --> 13:35.320
-Stop saying that!

13:35.360 --> 13:36.279
-[laughs]

13:36.320 --> 13:39.279
-Oh good, you're not busy.

13:39.320 --> 13:42.720
You can distribute
tonight's programs.

13:42.759 --> 13:45.440
-Uh, Miss Raine,
there's been a typo.

13:45.480 --> 13:48.320
Not so perfect with
the paperwork, huh?

13:48.360 --> 13:50.600
Uh, hip hop's been
left off the program.

13:50.639 --> 13:51.440
-No.

13:51.480 --> 13:52.159
The list is right.

13:52.200 --> 13:53.759
Jazz is gone too.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.360
-Uh, why?

13:55.399 --> 13:57.159
-The board's been in
meetings all morning

13:57.200 --> 13:58.200
about the curriculum.

13:58.240 --> 13:59.480
Given that most
of them don't feel

13:59.519 --> 14:01.399
the Academy should be
offering those classes,

14:01.440 --> 14:03.799
it was considered best to
remove them from the showcase.

14:03.840 --> 14:05.320
-But that's not fair!

14:05.360 --> 14:07.200
-It's the only time
some of us are dancing!

14:07.240 --> 14:08.399
-Well, if I were
you, I'd take that up

14:08.440 --> 14:10.360
with someone who is
actually on the board.

14:18.639 --> 14:20.559
-Imagine being like that.

14:20.600 --> 14:24.159
All they had to do today was
go to school, come home, maybe

14:24.200 --> 14:25.840
fit in some homework.

14:25.879 --> 14:28.480
-Well, what do you
want them to be doing?

14:28.519 --> 14:30.799
TARA: Nothing.

14:30.840 --> 14:33.559
I'd just, I would hate
not having a passion.

14:33.600 --> 14:35.799
-Well, you know, they'd
probably feel sorry for you

14:35.840 --> 14:38.200
if they knew what you do.

14:38.240 --> 14:40.639
-Well, it's not all work.

14:40.679 --> 14:41.799
I mean, I have fun.

14:41.840 --> 14:42.679
I have lots of fun.

14:42.720 --> 14:43.639
-Yep.

14:43.679 --> 14:45.200
Yeah, OK.

14:45.240 --> 14:45.759
-What?

14:45.799 --> 14:46.720
-What?

14:46.759 --> 14:49.039
-You don't think I have fun.

14:49.080 --> 14:49.600
-OK, go.

14:49.639 --> 14:50.559
Right now.

14:50.600 --> 14:52.240
I want to see you do fun.

14:52.279 --> 14:54.440
-I can't just suddenly
do my own fun.

14:54.480 --> 14:55.159
-Of course.

14:55.200 --> 14:55.679
You need friends.

14:55.720 --> 14:58.519
Um, hey hi!

14:58.559 --> 15:00.039
TARA: What are you doing?

15:00.080 --> 15:02.759
CHRISTIAN: Yeah um, my friend
here would really love a game.

15:02.799 --> 15:04.159
Is that cool?

15:04.200 --> 15:05.679
-Actually, he's the one
who's too shy to say it,

15:05.720 --> 15:07.200
but he can't wait to join in.

15:07.240 --> 15:09.799
-[laughs] Um, you can both play.

15:09.840 --> 15:12.440
I'm Shelly.

15:12.480 --> 15:13.799
-This is Tabitha.

15:13.840 --> 15:14.600
-Oh.

15:14.639 --> 15:15.399
He's Cecil.

15:15.440 --> 15:16.080
-Cecil?

15:20.840 --> 15:22.759
-Put your watch away, Tabs.

15:22.799 --> 15:24.399
-Just waiting for
you to bowl, Cecil.

15:30.120 --> 15:33.480
-All right, is there a
six and out rule or what?

15:33.519 --> 15:34.480
-Nice try!

15:34.519 --> 15:35.440
Go fetch!

15:43.679 --> 15:46.240
-Your boy's hot.

15:46.279 --> 15:49.639
-Oh, he's not my boyfriend.

15:49.679 --> 15:50.639
-Really?

15:50.679 --> 15:52.679
-But he does have a girlfriend.

15:52.720 --> 15:53.679
She's very possessive.

15:59.639 --> 16:00.600
-I got it!

16:08.120 --> 16:09.159
-Hello, darling.

16:09.200 --> 16:10.480
-I just want to
know how it works.

16:10.519 --> 16:12.759
Do you think, oh, i-is
Kat happy about something?

16:12.799 --> 16:14.360
How can I take
that away from her?

16:14.399 --> 16:16.720
-I'm sorry, but whatever it is
you're blaming me for today,

16:16.759 --> 16:17.639
it will have to wait.

16:17.679 --> 16:20.159
I have a rehearsal.

16:20.200 --> 16:22.159
-Those classes you just
cut are the only reason

16:22.200 --> 16:23.159
I'm still at the Academy.

16:23.200 --> 16:24.159
-Wait in my dressing room.

16:24.200 --> 16:25.639
We'll talk when I'm finished.

16:25.679 --> 16:28.559
-Mum, I've been waiting in your
dressing room for 16 years!

16:28.600 --> 16:29.399
-We'll talk later.

16:36.840 --> 16:38.600
-I put my number in your phone.

16:38.639 --> 16:41.240
If you like playing.

16:41.279 --> 16:42.039
-Thanks.

16:42.080 --> 16:43.440
I might take you up on that.

16:48.240 --> 16:49.159
What?

16:49.200 --> 16:51.519
-You just can't
help it, can you?

16:51.559 --> 16:52.799
-Sorry?

16:52.840 --> 16:53.720
-Flirting?

16:53.759 --> 16:55.600
-Oh, that wasn't flirting.

16:55.639 --> 16:57.200
-Well, what about her?

16:57.240 --> 16:58.559
I told her you had a girlfriend.

16:58.600 --> 17:02.679
That's like, hussy behavior.

17:02.720 --> 17:03.600
-Did you?

17:03.639 --> 17:04.680
-I don't mind.

17:04.720 --> 17:07.400
Frankly, Cecil, you
can [inaudible].

17:21.839 --> 17:23.598
SAMMY: 344.

17:23.640 --> 17:24.598
345.

17:24.640 --> 17:26.598
KAT: It's time for action!

17:26.640 --> 17:28.200
-346.

17:28.240 --> 17:30.319
347.

17:30.359 --> 17:33.160
Three more throws, I
would've broken a record.

17:33.200 --> 17:36.480
-In ball throwing cake eating.

17:36.519 --> 17:37.680
-It's an emerging sport.

17:37.720 --> 17:40.200
Which I'm probably gonna
take up full time, so.

17:40.240 --> 17:41.480
-Mm.

17:41.519 --> 17:44.160
OK, well, I think I've
found your deeper purpose.

17:48.559 --> 17:50.480
-Hey.

17:50.519 --> 17:51.799
-What?

17:51.839 --> 17:54.480
-You know how I'm not
allowed to look at my watch?

17:54.519 --> 17:55.480
-We're fine.

17:55.519 --> 17:56.480
We've got ages.

17:59.880 --> 18:02.680
This ferry's slow, huh?

18:02.720 --> 18:03.559
-We're dead.

18:03.599 --> 18:04.319
I'm swimming.

18:04.359 --> 18:04.799
-No, no!

18:04.839 --> 18:06.400
No! [laughs]

18:44.839 --> 18:47.440
-Um, hi everyone.

18:47.480 --> 18:48.920
Hi.

18:48.960 --> 18:50.759
Uh, proceedings will be starting
a little bit earlier today.

18:50.799 --> 18:52.640
By all means, keep
enjoying your drinks.

18:52.680 --> 18:54.640
But if you could
just take a seat?

18:54.680 --> 18:56.079
-Kat?

18:56.119 --> 18:57.480
Is there something you
want to share with us?

18:57.519 --> 18:59.160
-Uh, yes sir.

18:59.200 --> 19:01.799
The board in its
almighty wisdom has

19:01.839 --> 19:05.519
decided to cut the changes that
you made to the curriculum.

19:05.559 --> 19:09.079
Yeah, they're cutting
hip hop and jazz.

19:09.119 --> 19:13.200
Pretty much anything
that's not classical.

19:13.240 --> 19:15.799
Yeah, so um, there's a few
of the first years that

19:15.839 --> 19:17.200
worked really hard
on this piece,

19:17.240 --> 19:20.799
and we'd like to show
it to you anyway.

19:20.839 --> 19:22.799
-Just keep running!

19:22.839 --> 19:24.480
[laughs]

19:30.839 --> 19:32.440
[hip hop music playing]

20:18.480 --> 20:20.799
[cheers and applause]

20:20.839 --> 20:23.799
-Well uh, thank you, e-everyone.

20:23.839 --> 20:26.319
Um, that certainly
was a surprise.

20:26.359 --> 20:29.200
Well, um, if you
can bear with us,

20:29.240 --> 20:31.480
the formal part of the
program will continue as soon

20:31.519 --> 20:32.759
as possible.

20:32.799 --> 20:33.400
Thank you.

20:43.640 --> 20:44.599
-Ah! [giggles]

20:44.640 --> 20:45.240
-Come on!

20:49.079 --> 20:50.480
-What was that?

20:50.519 --> 20:53.319
-Uh, the most interesting thing
anyone will see all night?

20:53.359 --> 20:55.799
-One of the main reasons the
board cut the new curriculum is

20:55.839 --> 20:58.160
they think it encourages
a lack of discipline.

20:58.200 --> 21:00.039
You just proved them right.

21:00.079 --> 21:01.640
-Like you care
about helping, Mum.

21:01.680 --> 21:04.200
-Have you ever thought
to ask where I stand?

21:04.240 --> 21:05.559
Oh no, of course not.

21:05.599 --> 21:08.119
You just assume, as
usual, that I'm the enemy.

21:08.160 --> 21:10.640
I have always supported
a broad dance education.

21:10.680 --> 21:12.119
In fact, I spent
the last two days

21:12.160 --> 21:14.240
trying to convince
the board of it!

21:14.279 --> 21:16.759
Many students need to work
on their confidence and self

21:16.799 --> 21:18.200
expression.

21:18.240 --> 21:19.400
Hip hop and jazz are
perfect avenues for that.

21:19.440 --> 21:20.720
-Well then, why didn't
you say anything--

21:20.759 --> 21:22.279
-Self expression is
clearly something

21:22.319 --> 21:24.200
you don't need to work on.

21:24.240 --> 21:26.160
I respect your passion,
but what you did today

21:26.200 --> 21:27.680
was irresponsible.

21:27.720 --> 21:29.279
-Wait.

21:29.319 --> 21:33.599
I, I didn't hear a compliment
in there somewhere, did I?

21:33.640 --> 21:34.400
-Absolutely not.

21:42.880 --> 21:45.319
TARA: [laughing]

21:45.359 --> 21:46.799
-Do you know where she is?

21:46.839 --> 21:48.200
-Who?

21:48.240 --> 21:50.200
-We're bringing the first
year ballet forward.

21:50.240 --> 21:53.720
We need to display a modicum of
professionalism to the board.

21:53.759 --> 21:56.559
-But Tara's not here.

21:56.599 --> 21:58.359
-Then you'll have
to do it as a solo.

21:58.400 --> 22:01.559
You're always asking for one.

22:01.599 --> 22:03.480
-It's better as a duet.

22:03.519 --> 22:06.039
Sammy knows it.

22:06.079 --> 22:08.160
-Do you?

22:08.200 --> 22:09.400
-Understudy to Judy.

22:09.440 --> 22:10.640
-Well,you all have five
minutes to get ready.

22:10.680 --> 22:12.200
Please don't
disappoint me further.

22:16.440 --> 22:18.599
-Are you trying to
make me feel better?

22:18.640 --> 22:19.519
Hmm?

22:19.559 --> 22:20.640
Because I don't need pity.

22:20.680 --> 22:23.799
I've got hip hop and
cake throwing, so--

22:23.839 --> 22:24.799
-No!

22:24.839 --> 22:27.319
I did it because you're good.

22:27.359 --> 22:31.400
I wouldn't go out with
you if you weren't.

22:31.440 --> 22:32.799
-Go get ready.

22:32.839 --> 22:35.480

-Tara!

23:13.480 --> 23:16.440
[music playing]

23:31.839 --> 23:34.119
TARA (VOICEOVER):
Ballet is an addiction.

23:34.160 --> 23:36.599
The more you dance, the
more you want to dance,

23:36.640 --> 23:38.640
the more you need to dance.

23:38.680 --> 23:40.079
-[crying]

23:40.119 --> 23:41.799
TARA (VOICEOVER): That
focus is so intense

23:41.839 --> 23:44.480
that nothing else matters.

23:44.519 --> 23:46.799
It's only when you
stop dancing and let

23:46.839 --> 23:50.319
life creep in that
it becomes dangerous.

23:50.359 --> 23:53.200
Because all the greats,
from Pavlova down,

23:53.240 --> 23:55.640
know it's impossible
to have both.

23:55.680 --> 23:56.640
