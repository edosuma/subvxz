Obi-Wan
Kenobi in disguise!

00:19.338 --> 00:22.140
Working undercover as
assassin Rako Hardeen,

00:22.209 --> 00:25.675
Obi-Wan leads a secret mission
to uncover the separatist plot

00:25.711 --> 00:27.943
against Chancellor Palpatine.

00:27.978 --> 00:30.778
Using cunning and courage,
he gains the trust

00:30.847 --> 00:35.013
of bounty hunter Cad Bane and
criminal mastermind Moralo Eval,

00:35.049 --> 00:37.281
earning him entrance
to the stronghold of

00:37.317 --> 00:39.684
separatist leader Count Dooku.

00:39.719 --> 00:41.586
Now it is here, on
the beautiful planet

00:41.622 --> 00:44.588
of Serenno, that a barbaric
contest will determine

00:44.657 --> 00:49.761
the fate of Obi-Wan Kenobi and
possibly the Republic itself.

01:25.593 --> 01:29.793
Count Dooku, I apologize
for my delay.

01:31.888 --> 01:36.471
Your careless delay could
have ruined my plan, Eval.

01:36.506 --> 01:38.840
I see Cad Bane is with you.

01:38.909 --> 01:41.076
Who is the other one?

01:41.111 --> 01:43.611
This is Rako Hardeen.

01:43.647 --> 01:47.715
When Bane's escape plan failed,
we only succeeded thanks

01:47.751 --> 01:49.083
to Hardeen.

01:49.118 --> 01:52.453
I thought he might be
useful for the tournament.

01:52.521 --> 01:53.621
Enough small talk.

01:53.656 --> 01:54.822
I want my money.

01:54.891 --> 01:56.723
That makes two of us.

01:56.759 --> 02:02.161
You shall have it and perhaps
much more, both of you,

02:02.230 --> 02:07.066
if you would like to enter
our friendly little contest.

02:07.101 --> 02:09.335
I'm in if he's in.

02:09.370 --> 02:12.071
You already owe me
for one job, Dooku.

02:12.140 --> 02:14.507
Anything else will cost you triple.

02:14.543 --> 02:17.243
I assure you that if you
survive the challenge,

02:17.278 --> 02:19.593
the reward will be well worth it.

02:31.523 --> 02:34.424
We have all the contestants we need.

02:34.459 --> 02:36.259
Prepare the tournament.

02:36.294 --> 02:38.594
Yes, my Lord.

02:55.011 --> 02:56.879
You summoned me, Master?

02:56.914 --> 02:59.115
Wrong to deceive you it was.

02:59.150 --> 03:01.884
But much at stake there is.

03:01.919 --> 03:03.052
So I was right.

03:03.121 --> 03:05.387
Obi-Wan is still alive.

03:05.423 --> 03:10.792
Skywalker, a powerful Jedi
you are, yet unpredictable

03:10.861 --> 03:15.808
and dangerous you can be to
both your friends and enemies.

03:16.766 --> 03:21.402
For Obi-Wan, on your
patience everything depends.

03:21.471 --> 03:23.371
What if he needs our help?

03:23.407 --> 03:24.673
Mm.

03:24.708 --> 03:28.239
If you leave, help him you could,

03:28.359 --> 03:32.481
but his future uncertain is.

03:32.549 --> 03:35.747
Trust in Obi-Wan we must.

03:46.228 --> 03:49.497
So what kind of friendly
little contest do you think

03:49.566 --> 03:51.398
the Count's got planned?

03:51.467 --> 03:54.536
I'd be surprised if we all survive.

03:57.338 --> 04:00.105
Nice hat.

04:03.678 --> 04:06.112
Where did you get it?

04:17.757 --> 04:19.459
What are you looking at?

04:19.528 --> 04:21.560
It's a nice hat.

04:21.596 --> 04:23.967
Welcome to Serenno.

04:24.934 --> 04:28.102
You have been invited here
because you are the best

04:28.138 --> 04:30.839
bounty hunters in the galaxy.

04:30.875 --> 04:34.811
Kiera Swan, two-time winner
of the Obsidian Sphere.

04:34.846 --> 04:39.182
Derrown, known simply
as the exterminator.

04:39.218 --> 04:41.919
Sixtat, the Outlands Butcher.

04:41.987 --> 04:46.990
Embo, your bounty tallies were
second only to one last season.

04:47.025 --> 04:50.460
Cad Bane, who needs no introduction.

04:50.495 --> 04:54.697
Rako Hardeen, the
marksman of Concord Dawn.

04:54.733 --> 04:59.102
Jakoli, known for never
bringing anyone back alive.

04:59.137 --> 05:03.106
Onca, you and your brother
have been a legendary team.

05:03.174 --> 05:07.076
This challenge may prove
difficult for you alone.

05:07.112 --> 05:10.413
Twazzi, your acrobatics
once earned you praise from

05:10.448 --> 05:12.248
Chancellor Valorum.

05:12.284 --> 05:16.519
Sinrich, inventor of the
holographic disguise matrix.

05:16.555 --> 05:21.891
And finally, Mantu, your people
were once a peaceful race.

05:21.960 --> 05:24.160
How far they have fallen.

05:24.195 --> 05:28.860
In a few moments, all 11 of you
will enter what we call The Box.

05:42.145 --> 05:44.680
Some of you will not
make it out alive.

05:44.715 --> 05:47.216
For those who do, we are
looking for the Five

05:47.251 --> 05:49.218
most skilled among you.

05:49.253 --> 05:52.521
Any additional survivors
will be eliminated

05:52.557 --> 05:56.692
to preserve the integrity
of the job that awaits you.

05:56.761 --> 05:58.861
Place your weapons here.

05:58.897 --> 06:02.331
For those we choose, you
will, of course, be paid

06:02.367 --> 06:03.800
most handsomely.

06:03.868 --> 06:06.135
But more than that, you
will be a part of an

06:06.170 --> 06:10.672
operation remembered as a turning
point in the clone wars.

06:10.707 --> 06:14.041
And when we succeed, we
will bring the Republic

06:14.110 --> 06:16.410
to its pitiful knees.

06:16.479 --> 06:17.378
Listen up.

06:17.413 --> 06:21.249
The Box was designed
by me, Moralo Eval,

06:21.318 --> 06:26.488
to simulate certain situations
that might happen on the job.

06:26.524 --> 06:27.423
Go now.

06:27.492 --> 06:31.134
Enter The Box, if you
have the courage.

06:50.998 --> 06:52.172
That's it.

06:52.207 --> 06:54.541
Everyone inside.

06:54.610 --> 06:56.543
Keep moving.

07:23.439 --> 07:26.573
Before we begin our first challenge,

07:26.609 --> 07:31.044
let me say there is only
one rule inside The Box.

07:31.080 --> 07:32.879
There are no rules.

07:32.948 --> 07:33.880
Totti cano?

07:33.949 --> 07:35.415
Mataraz prekay?

07:35.484 --> 07:40.120
The point, my friend, is
to escape and quickly,

07:40.155 --> 07:45.324
because only the survivors will
advance to the next challenge.

07:52.433 --> 07:53.498
Dioxis.

07:53.534 --> 07:56.701
Breathe it, and you're dead.

07:59.439 --> 08:02.140
Every man for himself.

08:02.208 --> 08:03.207
Ah!

08:03.243 --> 08:05.209
Whoa!

08:11.950 --> 08:15.587
That wasn't so hard.

08:24.598 --> 08:25.231
Ooh!

08:27.635 --> 08:29.642
Za leep din-raaar!

08:31.373 --> 08:32.472
The way out isn't up.

08:32.506 --> 08:34.039
It's down.

08:34.109 --> 08:36.676
The filters in my helmet can
protect me for a short time.

08:36.711 --> 08:38.678
I'll scout a way out.

09:01.769 --> 09:04.738
There's a hole in the floor which
gets you below the gas line.

09:04.773 --> 09:06.874
Jump down the hole and
follow the tunnel.

09:09.078 --> 09:10.377
What if he's wrong?

09:10.446 --> 09:13.013
You got a better idea?

09:38.941 --> 09:41.376
What took you so long?

09:48.751 --> 09:51.353
Moralo Eval is impressed.

09:51.421 --> 09:53.922
No casualties on the first challenge.

09:55.459 --> 09:59.894
I guarantee you that will not
be the case in the next.

10:36.265 --> 10:38.500
Impressive.

10:38.535 --> 10:42.137
I sense something
different about that one.

10:42.172 --> 10:45.608
Tel me what you know
about this Rako Hardeen.

10:46.777 --> 10:49.977
He killed the Jedi Obi-Wan Kenobi

10:50.237 --> 10:53.248
but only with a sniper rifle.

10:53.317 --> 10:56.418
Obi-Wan Kenobi?

11:12.802 --> 11:13.969
I know how to get out.

11:14.005 --> 11:14.871
Show me.

11:14.939 --> 11:16.672
There's a pattern to the blades.

11:16.741 --> 11:18.040
Watch.

11:18.109 --> 11:20.943
That one's next.

11:20.979 --> 11:25.115
If I can time it right, I can
climb up to that exit shaft.

11:25.151 --> 11:27.051
Just follow me and time your jump.

11:27.086 --> 11:29.020
Go.

11:32.425 --> 11:34.391
Get moving.

12:28.015 --> 12:30.216
Hardeen has done it again.

12:30.285 --> 12:32.652
I'm beginning to think
he may be the best one

12:32.721 --> 12:34.721
to lead this operation.

12:34.757 --> 12:38.992
Hardeen is crafty, I will grant you.

12:39.028 --> 12:41.995
But let's see what happens
when he is not the key

12:42.031 --> 12:44.198
to their survival.

12:51.740 --> 12:55.276
To reach your final challenge,
you must pass through

12:55.311 --> 12:57.111
my ray shield.

13:07.289 --> 13:11.092
The switch to turn it off
is on the other side.

13:11.160 --> 13:15.529
The syringe on the platform
contains a highly electrolytic

13:15.565 --> 13:20.901
serum that will allow you
to pass through the shield.

13:20.970 --> 13:25.840
However, it is toxic
to all but one of you.

13:28.854 --> 13:30.011
Cano toni.

13:30.047 --> 13:31.846
Passo-gran-sheesay.

13:31.915 --> 13:33.915
So it would seem.

14:12.622 --> 14:14.857
Hey, who put you in charge?

14:14.926 --> 14:17.293
Sa leep gaj ma ta-reel.

14:17.362 --> 14:20.197
Does anyone know what
this gasbag is saying?

14:20.232 --> 14:21.131
I do.

14:21.166 --> 14:23.300
He can get us out of this.

14:26.038 --> 14:27.005
He's a Parwan.

14:27.040 --> 14:29.474
His blood can take the
electrolytic serum.

14:29.509 --> 14:31.008
Din rar.

14:31.077 --> 14:32.443
Are you certain?

14:32.478 --> 14:33.477
50/50.

14:33.546 --> 14:35.746
Depends on the blood
type of the Parwan.

14:35.782 --> 14:37.748
Great.

14:47.725 --> 14:49.192
Hurry. Use the serum.

15:12.582 --> 15:17.921
Wha--

15:42.147 --> 15:45.149
His blood, how did you know about it?

15:45.184 --> 15:47.451
I used to kill Parwans for a living.

15:47.486 --> 15:49.453
Ga?

15:53.591 --> 15:56.993
Your box does not appear to
be as much of a challenge

15:57.062 --> 15:58.328
as I thought.

15:58.363 --> 16:02.165
Perhaps I should put Hardeen
in charge of the mission.

16:02.234 --> 16:04.434
But this was my plan.

16:04.502 --> 16:08.305
You promised me the lead role.

16:08.340 --> 16:12.977
You have one last test
to change my mind.

16:13.012 --> 16:15.579
Do not fear, Count Dooku.

16:15.614 --> 16:18.849
I will show you who is weak.

16:36.537 --> 16:40.073
The final challenge has arrived.

16:55.310 --> 16:58.325
Grosso pozzi nix strumpf?

16:59.994 --> 17:03.596
Unfortunately, no.

17:14.608 --> 17:18.011
We are going to test
your sniper skills.

17:18.047 --> 17:20.414
Hit the target.

17:25.619 --> 17:27.454
Step back, boys.

17:27.490 --> 17:30.023
I'll show you how it's done.

17:49.909 --> 17:51.075
I get it.

17:51.111 --> 17:53.845
If we miss the target, this
platform gets smaller.

17:53.914 --> 17:56.548
Soon there won't be
any platform left.

18:14.636 --> 18:18.204
This is not the first time
you've saved everybody's skin,

18:18.273 --> 18:19.572
Hardeen.

18:19.641 --> 18:21.274
Five more hits.

18:21.309 --> 18:24.109
Let's see how good you really are.

18:46.470 --> 18:48.270
Oh, what a shame.

18:48.305 --> 18:50.305
Out of charges.

18:50.374 --> 18:54.075
It's also important as a
bounty hunter to be lucky,

18:54.144 --> 18:57.979
and your luck just ran out.

19:02.217 --> 19:04.251
Ah!

19:08.443 --> 19:11.712
How dare you defy Moralo Eval?

19:11.780 --> 19:15.082
If you're gonna kill
him, do it like a man.

19:15.150 --> 19:17.150
You heard him, Eval.

19:21.022 --> 19:25.125
Show us what you are really made of.

19:56.527 --> 19:57.693
Ah!

19:59.063 --> 20:01.430
You're gonna have to
do better than that.

20:01.466 --> 20:06.068
Hmm, you, my friend,
have seen nothing yet.

20:08.138 --> 20:10.104
Yah!

20:22.819 --> 20:25.318
Let's even the playing field.

20:51.779 --> 20:53.580
Finish him, Hardeen.

20:57.785 --> 20:59.753
Very disappointing.

20:59.821 --> 21:05.726
All due respect, I just want
to do my job and get my money.

21:05.761 --> 21:10.097
It is unfortunate that your
leadership skills are so lacking.

21:10.132 --> 21:14.367
Nonetheless, congratulations
on surviving The Box.

21:14.403 --> 21:17.003
Tomorrow you will kidnap
Chancellor Palpatine

21:17.038 --> 21:19.105
at the festival on Naboo.

21:19.173 --> 21:22.007
With the leader of the
Republic as our hostage,

21:22.043 --> 21:26.378
we will demand the release
of all separatist prisoners.

21:26.413 --> 21:30.916
If our demand is not met, the
Chancellor will be executed.

21:30.951 --> 21:34.253
Either way, you will
help reshape the galaxy.

21:34.288 --> 21:36.722
Once you are all
aboard the transport,

21:36.791 --> 21:39.035
Eval will walk you through his plan.

21:39.155 --> 21:44.785
However, the operation on Naboo
will be run by Cad Bane.

21:47.140 --> 21:50.054
All of you work for him now.
