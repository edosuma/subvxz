WEBVTT

00:16.057 --> 00:17.559
All right, warmed up.

00:17.559 --> 00:19.352
Go all out now, okay? As hard as you can.

00:19.352 --> 00:20.311
What?

00:26.401 --> 00:27.652
You really want to do this?

00:27.652 --> 00:29.612
You're the one who said
I had to fight for her.

00:29.612 --> 00:33.116
I was speaking figuratively.
Aldon will kick your ass.

00:33.116 --> 00:35.035
That's why I'm asking you to train me.

00:35.035 --> 00:38.163
I know something's up,
and everything points to him.

00:38.163 --> 00:42.083
Emma's always running off
at the last minute all around the world.

00:42.083 --> 00:45.295
And I've got to assume that their company
also sends him on these trips.

00:45.879 --> 00:49.632
Plus, how many times in a month
does someone need to get their car washed?

00:49.632 --> 00:50.967
She likes a clean car.

00:50.967 --> 00:53.928
She's... She's acting very weird, man.

00:53.928 --> 00:55.764
- Speaking Swahili.
- She what?

00:55.764 --> 00:57.766
And... romantically,

00:58.850 --> 01:04.230
she's gotten quite adventurous as of late,
almost like she's making up for something.

01:04.230 --> 01:06.566
- I don't need to hear that.
- Yeah, my bad. Fair enough.

01:06.566 --> 01:09.319
I don't know why
I thought you should hear that.

01:09.319 --> 01:11.362
I... I know something's going on.

01:11.362 --> 01:12.572
If I listen to my gut,

01:12.572 --> 01:16.576
my gut tells me I gotta confront that guy,
even if I have to fight him.

01:16.576 --> 01:18.787
Even if it means I get my ass kicked.

01:18.787 --> 01:20.121
For Emma.

01:20.872 --> 01:22.665
Emma is worth fighting for.

01:24.584 --> 01:25.502
I love her.

01:25.502 --> 01:27.087
You're a good young man, Carter.

01:27.087 --> 01:30.799
Now you're standing here
with boxing gloves on, for Pete's sakes.

01:31.883 --> 01:32.717
And, uh...

01:34.844 --> 01:36.638
Oh... And what?

01:37.347 --> 01:38.932
Uh, nothing.

01:39.557 --> 01:41.935
No, something. Something's upsetting you.
You're just not saying it.

01:41.935 --> 01:43.728
You had the same look on your face
when I told you

01:43.728 --> 01:46.147
that I was on my high school cheer team.

01:47.440 --> 01:48.650
It's probably worse.

01:49.692 --> 01:51.402
Please, Mr. Brunner,

01:51.903 --> 01:53.279
what aren't you telling me?

01:58.076 --> 01:59.619
I saw Emma and Aldon kissing.

02:01.371 --> 02:02.330
Carter,

02:03.331 --> 02:04.207
please,

02:05.667 --> 02:06.835
talk to Emma.

02:07.418 --> 02:09.212
Maybe you can work things out.

02:23.184 --> 02:24.519
Hey, it's the fiancÃ©.

02:30.984 --> 02:34.070
- What's up with him?
- Oh, he's tired from the training.

02:34.070 --> 02:36.114
He wants to get into wedding shape.

02:36.114 --> 02:37.532
So how is Romi?

02:37.532 --> 02:39.534
Better every minute.
The docs couldn't be happier.

02:39.534 --> 02:42.036
- She'll be home in a few days.
- Thank God.

02:42.036 --> 02:45.248
I come with more good news.
My app is gonna be launching at Ralph's.

02:45.248 --> 02:49.210
Ralph's is one of the biggest chains
on the West Coast. How did you land that?

02:49.210 --> 02:52.005
Not that Ralph's.
Ralph Moskowitz's bodega.

02:52.005 --> 02:54.507
- Oh.
- It's a beta run to show how it works.

02:54.507 --> 02:56.926
I was hoping you could go check it out.

02:56.926 --> 02:58.511
- I'll download it for you.
- No, it's--

02:58.511 --> 02:59.470
I got it.

03:00.180 --> 03:03.641
And Donnie's investment let me add
new features like a barcode reader.

03:03.641 --> 03:07.687
It advises you on coupons,
allergens, nutrition.

03:07.687 --> 03:09.230
Any data in the barcode's revealed.

03:09.856 --> 03:13.067
MyAisles is gonna revolutionize
the grocery store experience.

03:13.067 --> 03:15.069
You grab an apple. You pay for the apple.

03:15.069 --> 03:17.030
You don't need a revolution for that.

03:17.822 --> 03:18.781
Check it out.

03:21.284 --> 03:22.535
It works.

03:22.535 --> 03:25.038
It says the app is a bad idea.

03:47.060 --> 03:50.021
- The kiss was a mistake.
- I'm so glad that you said that first.

03:50.021 --> 03:51.731
Good. Okay.

03:52.273 --> 03:53.608
Okay, so friends then?

03:53.608 --> 03:55.443
Yes, ma'am. Friends. Absolutely.

04:06.329 --> 04:07.622
- French.

04:10.208 --> 04:11.209
Portuguese.

04:14.087 --> 04:15.004
German.

04:15.630 --> 04:17.507
-  Whoa! No, scary.

04:17.507 --> 04:20.134
- Um, back to French.
- Okay.

04:24.347 --> 04:27.100
Did you just say "let's go to a motel"?

04:27.100 --> 04:28.935
Or a hotel. I've got miles.

04:30.436 --> 04:33.022
- If we go to a hotel, we have sex.
- That's the idea.

04:33.940 --> 04:34.899
What?

04:37.735 --> 04:40.280
Okay I... No, I, um... I can't do this. Um...

04:41.114 --> 04:41.990
Carter.

04:43.199 --> 04:44.367
I... I can't do this to Carter.

04:44.367 --> 04:46.786
My heart is telling me,
"No, stop, this is wrong."

04:46.786 --> 04:48.579
Okay. But what is your groin saying?

04:48.579 --> 04:51.791
'Cause mine's saying
we should definitely go to a motel, right?

04:55.336 --> 04:57.046
Okay. All right, no, you're right.

04:57.547 --> 04:59.590
You're right. This is messed up.
You're engaged.

05:01.342 --> 05:02.802
I've been a lot of things in my life,

05:02.802 --> 05:05.805
and an intentional home-wrecker
has never been one of them.

05:06.889 --> 05:08.224
- So...
- Intentional?

05:08.224 --> 05:09.934
Well, they don't always wear rings.

05:21.988 --> 05:24.407
Box seats behind the dugout?

05:24.907 --> 05:25.867
Just got them.

05:26.451 --> 05:29.037
- Paid through the nose.
- Mm-hm.

05:29.037 --> 05:30.079
Ah.

05:30.788 --> 05:32.290
What's the occasion?

05:32.290 --> 05:34.000
I think Emma needs a break.

05:34.000 --> 05:37.587
Between us losing Boro
and everything that's going on with Romi,

05:38.254 --> 05:40.173
I think it'd be good
to have a day just to talk.

05:40.173 --> 05:41.591
So no occasion?

05:41.591 --> 05:44.927
When she was nine,
I missed her gymnastics championships.

05:44.927 --> 05:47.638
To make up for it,
we did family day in the stadium.

05:47.638 --> 05:49.932
I carried her around on my shoulders.

05:49.932 --> 05:50.850
We had hot dogs.

05:50.850 --> 05:52.226
The perfect day.

05:52.226 --> 05:55.646
She even got
an autographed baseball from Jeter.

05:55.646 --> 05:59.359
I remember family day
at Fishkill Correctional.

05:59.359 --> 06:01.527
Buzzie The Strangler gave me a tissue.

06:02.028 --> 06:03.029
It had his mucus on it.

06:04.280 --> 06:07.450
- At least, I thought it was mucus.

06:07.450 --> 06:09.369
Hey, Emma, check this out.

06:09.994 --> 06:11.621
Bronx Bomber family day.

06:11.621 --> 06:13.081
Just like old times?

06:13.081 --> 06:13.998
Surprised?

06:14.499 --> 06:16.042
Oh Dad, wow, that's great.

06:16.042 --> 06:17.418
I... I would love to, really,

06:17.418 --> 06:20.421
but... I need to spend
the weekend with Carter.

06:20.421 --> 06:23.049
I've been away a lot,
and I think it's getting to him.

06:23.049 --> 06:25.718
- Rain check?
- Sure, yeah.

06:25.718 --> 06:27.261
We just do it some other day.

06:27.261 --> 06:30.223
As long as we get some time
to talk a little bit, okay?

06:30.223 --> 06:31.349
Sure. Yeah.

06:37.271 --> 06:38.398
Greetings, chief.

06:50.243 --> 06:51.411
Sit down and listen.

06:52.412 --> 06:57.417
So, Langley thinks they know why Boro
took such risks to get his weapon back.

06:57.417 --> 07:00.711
- Um, to sell it?
- If he did, he'd be out of inventory.

07:01.337 --> 07:03.840
Now that he has the stolen waste
from the Kazakh train,

07:03.840 --> 07:05.383
and he has the suitcase back,

07:05.383 --> 07:08.386
we believe he will utilize
the suitcase's nuclear core

07:08.386 --> 07:11.431
to re-irradiate the waste
and make another half dozen nukes.

07:11.431 --> 07:13.349
Remind me again why we didn't torture him

07:13.349 --> 07:15.768
instead of giving him
exactly what he wanted?

07:17.979 --> 07:18.896
Respectfully.

07:19.397 --> 07:22.400
Well, can't we find Boro
by scanning for the radiation signature,

07:22.400 --> 07:24.026
like we did in Greece?

07:24.026 --> 07:26.320
We've been trying, but no luck. Tina?

07:27.196 --> 07:29.115
My pals at NSA have picked up chatter

07:29.115 --> 07:32.743
that Boro could have his weapons
ready for sale in ten days or less.

07:32.743 --> 07:34.996
NSA also intercepted conversations

07:34.996 --> 07:38.249
about a high-stakes card game
taking place two days from now

07:38.249 --> 07:40.710
at an oligarch's mansion outside Moscow.

07:41.294 --> 07:44.464
Exclusive annual event
with a 200-year history.

07:45.131 --> 07:46.299
Game's a little shady.

07:46.299 --> 07:49.427
Super rich from all over the world
pay a fortune to attend.

07:49.427 --> 07:50.845
It's a status thing.

07:50.845 --> 07:53.514
Some of the players
are underworld characters.

07:53.514 --> 07:58.269
Sources tell us that Boro's
right-hand man, Cain, will be there.

07:58.269 --> 08:02.023
So Cain gets a day off
from side-kicking and bootlicking.

08:02.023 --> 08:04.317
When he's done,
we follow him back to Boro.

08:04.317 --> 08:05.276
Not that simple.

08:05.276 --> 08:07.862
Since escaping Guyana,
we believe Boro and his team

08:07.862 --> 08:10.364
have been traveling exclusively
in private aircraft

08:10.364 --> 08:12.158
with radar-deflecting capability.

08:12.158 --> 08:15.953
Not to mention, they're most likely
moving in and out of unfriendly nations

08:15.953 --> 08:17.205
that don't provide us intel.

08:17.205 --> 08:20.750
However, we have ascertained
that during the game,

08:20.750 --> 08:23.127
cell phones are locked in a box
to prevent cheating.

08:23.127 --> 08:24.795
We get operatives into the game

08:24.795 --> 08:27.340
with data rippers
disguised as cell phones.

08:27.340 --> 08:29.884
They'll extract data from other phones
they're locked in with.

08:29.884 --> 08:32.678
And from that
we can access Cain's GPS data

08:32.678 --> 08:35.556
and learn where he's been,
which will give us Boro's location.

08:35.556 --> 08:37.016
And the location of the nukes.

08:37.016 --> 08:38.392
But therein lies the rub

08:38.392 --> 08:41.562
because Cain already knows
all of our very attractive faces.

08:41.562 --> 08:42.897
Not all of them.

08:44.815 --> 08:46.609
- There's gotta be a better option.
- What he said.

08:46.609 --> 08:49.111
The Boro operation
has been designated need-to-know.

08:49.111 --> 08:51.113
The game's less than 48 hours away.

08:51.113 --> 08:54.784
There's no time to get clearance
and fully read in two new operatives.

08:54.784 --> 08:58.704
Barry and Tina will get their cover IDs.
CIA will bankroll the five million buy-in.

08:58.704 --> 09:00.498
The CIA's got it like that?

09:00.498 --> 09:02.667
Why am I still shopping at T.J. Maxx?

09:02.667 --> 09:05.086
'Cause you like name brands
at no-name prices.

09:06.546 --> 09:08.798
We'll need to clone every phone in the box

09:08.798 --> 09:10.716
since we have no way of knowing
which is Cain's.

09:10.716 --> 09:11.926
That's a lot of data.

09:11.926 --> 09:14.595
That's why we need two players,
each with their own data ripper.

09:14.595 --> 09:18.099
Director, as much as I'd love
to put myself in danger again,

09:18.099 --> 09:22.103
even though I'm not a field operative,
as clearly delineated in my contract...

09:23.145 --> 09:26.524
- I don't know how to play cards.
- You won't have to. You'll cheat.

09:27.108 --> 09:28.901
Cheaters never prosper.

09:32.196 --> 09:33.531
Concur.

09:33.531 --> 09:38.327
So how do we get these two
into an exclusive oligarch card game?

09:38.327 --> 09:40.121
Clock's ticking. Figure it out.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.299
I gotta deal with something.

09:52.049 --> 09:53.301
Aldon, you're senior.

09:53.301 --> 09:57.638
Emma has the most Boro experience,
so work together.

09:57.638 --> 10:00.850
The two of you... should be good at that.

10:08.357 --> 10:10.318
Those weird brothers sent it to me.

10:10.318 --> 10:11.694
There were three people.

10:11.694 --> 10:14.655
The smaller one went inside quickly
before I could make him out,

10:14.655 --> 10:18.451
but I know that's Emma's friend
from work, Aldon,

10:18.451 --> 10:19.785
and he's with Kyle,

10:19.785 --> 10:21.954
and Kyle's clearly been kidnapped.

10:23.497 --> 10:25.249
I just want the truth, Luke.

10:29.712 --> 10:30.921
Remember when I told you

10:30.921 --> 10:33.924
that we had to convince Kyle
to make the right decision?

10:33.924 --> 10:35.426
That's how we convinced him.

10:35.426 --> 10:36.677
And Aldon helped me.

10:36.677 --> 10:38.721
Because at the engagement party,
he told me

10:38.721 --> 10:41.390
that he needed a little side job
to make some extra money,

10:41.390 --> 10:44.143
so I gave him this job
and paid him a couple of bucks.

10:44.143 --> 10:45.519
But it was for a good cause.

10:45.519 --> 10:47.146
Romi was really sick.

10:47.146 --> 10:48.856
And we didn't hurt Kyle.

10:48.856 --> 10:52.360
We just scared him...
to make the right decision.

10:53.903 --> 10:57.531
I guess you did what you thought
you needed to do for Romi.

10:58.115 --> 11:00.451
Fine. But the Twinning Formula guys say

11:00.451 --> 11:02.870
you've been faking sales figures
to win awards.

11:02.870 --> 11:05.706
And they wanna see the books,
or they'll start making noise.

11:05.706 --> 11:08.334
I poked around, Luke, and they're right.

11:08.918 --> 11:13.255
Something... Something shady
is going on at Merry Fitness,

11:13.255 --> 11:15.716
and I need to know what it is.

11:28.979 --> 11:30.481
You deserve to know the truth.

11:34.068 --> 11:35.528
Barry has a gambling problem.

11:35.528 --> 11:39.323
Bartholomew Tiberius Putt, a gambler?

11:39.323 --> 11:41.409
He owes a lot of money
to some really bad people,

11:41.409 --> 11:42.993
and I'm trying to help him.

11:42.993 --> 11:44.537
That's why I'm working all the time.

11:44.537 --> 11:48.541
We're using the marketing money
to pay off the gambling debt.

11:48.541 --> 11:53.003
And yes, we are fudging the sales numbers
because we want to win the sales awards.

11:53.003 --> 11:55.339
And the awards
get your name out there for free.

11:55.339 --> 11:56.257
Yes.

11:56.257 --> 11:58.759
The more customers that come in,
the more money comes in,

11:58.759 --> 12:00.845
the more we can go and give to the bookie.

12:00.845 --> 12:03.222
It's a vicious cycle. It's a mess.

12:03.222 --> 12:06.600
You know, I swung by Barry's the other day

12:06.600 --> 12:08.561
to drop off some Tilapia Veracruz

12:08.561 --> 12:10.646
because he's eating
so much crap all the time.

12:10.646 --> 12:12.022
He wasn't home,

12:12.022 --> 12:15.025
but I could see through the window
that all his toys were gone.

12:15.901 --> 12:17.945
Is that-- Is that because of all this?

12:17.945 --> 12:21.407
He sold everything
to pay off the gambling losses.

12:21.407 --> 12:26.203
But, please, don't give any of this
information to those bozo brothers

12:26.203 --> 12:29.582
because they will shut us down,
and Barry could really get hurt.

12:29.582 --> 12:31.542
I will figure something out.

12:31.542 --> 12:33.753
Not like what you did to Kyle, right?

12:33.753 --> 12:35.629
No, we won't touch them.

12:36.964 --> 12:38.466
Now let me ask you something.

12:39.467 --> 12:41.218
I mean, we could have met anywhere,

12:42.344 --> 12:43.888
and I invited you many times.

12:43.888 --> 12:47.183
What made you finally decide
to come on board?

12:48.058 --> 12:49.268
I don't know.

12:51.270 --> 12:52.521
I... I guess...

12:54.857 --> 12:56.442
I didn't know what you did,

12:56.442 --> 13:00.738
but I knew you did something for Romi
to save her.

13:01.822 --> 13:02.698
I just...

13:05.534 --> 13:08.287
I wanted to do something for you too.

13:09.079 --> 13:12.333
Now, everything you've been
going through because of Barry,

13:13.209 --> 13:17.463
you make it real hard
to stay mad at you, Luke Brunner.

13:22.468 --> 13:23.969
I haven't always been perfect,

13:25.638 --> 13:28.641
but I'm always trying to do
the right thing for our family.

13:31.185 --> 13:32.019
For you.

13:43.280 --> 13:45.157
This is an automatic shuffler

13:45.157 --> 13:48.244
used in high-stakes poker games
to ensure no one cheats.

13:48.744 --> 13:50.579
We will use it to cheat.

13:54.500 --> 13:57.711
It has a pinhead camera
to confirm a standard 52-card deck.

13:57.711 --> 13:58.879
It's also hackable.

13:58.879 --> 14:01.715
We'll read the deal
and feed you the data with these.

14:18.732 --> 14:21.569
A receiver will send
our voices via vibration

14:21.569 --> 14:22.987
to the auditory bones in your ear.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.989
You'll hear us, but no one else will,

14:24.989 --> 14:27.533
and we will hear and see
everything that you do.

14:27.533 --> 14:29.034
An AI program will guide your play,

14:29.034 --> 14:32.580
so you'll remain in the game long enough
to complete the spoofing of Cain's phone.

14:32.580 --> 14:34.039
But even if we crap out,

14:34.039 --> 14:36.250
couldn't we just hang around
until we download the data?

14:36.250 --> 14:39.128
Negative. It's considered bad luck.
You bust, you go.

14:39.128 --> 14:41.881
There are a lot of traditions in the game.
We don't know half of them.

14:42.381 --> 14:43.465
Your cover IDs.

14:44.091 --> 14:46.927
They hate Americans,
so, Barry, you're Nigerian.

14:46.927 --> 14:49.722
Been a while since you've studied
dialect at The Farm, so brush up.

14:50.306 --> 14:52.224
Tina, no, you're not trained in this,

14:52.224 --> 14:55.561
but your NSA file says your grandmother
was French, and you're fluent.

14:55.561 --> 14:56.645
Can you handle the accent?

14:59.231 --> 15:00.149
Not an issue.

15:00.149 --> 15:03.319
To prevent collusion,
all the players have to speak English.

15:03.319 --> 15:05.487
One to ten, where's your freak-out meter?

15:05.988 --> 15:06.822
Eight.

15:08.157 --> 15:09.658
But it was 34 in prison.

15:10.242 --> 15:11.827
Good. Progress.

15:14.663 --> 15:20.336
<i>- âª The moon may be high âª
- âª Sha bop âª</i>

15:21.295 --> 15:22.504
<i>âª Sha bop âª</i>

15:22.504 --> 15:28.260
<i>- âª But I can't see a thing in the sky âª
- âª Sha bop âª</i>

15:28.260 --> 15:34.433
<i>âª I only have eyes âª</i>

15:35.476 --> 15:36.936
<i>âª For... âª</i>

15:36.936 --> 15:39.271
That was fluffing fantastic.

15:40.898 --> 15:43.525
- Just like old times.
- Wow.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.244
Donnie's been talking about marriage,

15:55.245 --> 15:56.747
hinting he might ask.

15:56.747 --> 15:59.667
You really suck at pillow talk.

15:59.667 --> 16:03.045
I didn't wake up this morning
thinking this would happen.

16:03.045 --> 16:06.966
These feelings, they're new and old.

16:07.758 --> 16:09.885
I want to make sure they're real.

16:10.970 --> 16:12.304
Well they're real for me.

16:14.682 --> 16:16.934
There hasn't been a day I didn't love you.

16:17.935 --> 16:19.561
And that's very sweet,

16:20.771 --> 16:22.564
but you also hurt me real bad.

16:24.692 --> 16:26.944
And I'm in a good relationship right now.

16:27.945 --> 16:29.571
This might have been a mistake.

16:30.489 --> 16:31.532
It wasn't.

16:34.326 --> 16:35.786
Doesn't feel like one.

16:37.830 --> 16:39.790
But I need to make sure.

16:40.374 --> 16:43.335
So as soon as you're back
from your business trip,

16:43.335 --> 16:45.379
let's spend more time together.

16:45.379 --> 16:46.755
Proper dates.

16:46.755 --> 16:49.174
Get a feel for what's going on here.

16:50.467 --> 16:51.468
Pinky promise?

16:54.722 --> 16:57.725
I think we can do better
than a pinky promise.

16:59.560 --> 17:01.937
- You're right.

17:04.189 --> 17:05.024
<i>âª Sha bop âª</i>

17:08.402 --> 17:09.236
<i>âª Sha bop âª</i>

17:12.156 --> 17:13.449
<i>âª Sha bop âª</i>

17:17.494 --> 17:20.080
With the help of a ton
of confiscated cartel cash,

17:20.080 --> 17:23.375
we got Barry and Tina bumped to the top
of the card game's alternate list.

17:23.375 --> 17:24.877
So how do we get them to the table?

17:24.877 --> 17:28.422
We can wait for my dad, but he did leave
Aldon and me to run point, so--

17:28.422 --> 17:31.050
Throwing Papa under the bus. Classy.

17:32.009 --> 17:35.054
- We can break down what we put together.
- Proceed.

17:35.054 --> 17:37.347
It's a five-player game.
We take out two of the players.

17:37.347 --> 17:38.974
They have to replace them
with two of our guys.

17:38.974 --> 17:40.726
We chose a couple, the Biryukovs.

17:41.852 --> 17:43.979
Their place is a fortress
with top-of-the-line security.

17:43.979 --> 17:47.357
Five guards. Two out back,
two at the gate, one inside.

17:47.357 --> 17:48.275
We start in the back.

17:48.275 --> 17:51.111
They're ex-Aussie Special Forces
working private sector.

17:51.111 --> 17:52.029
We can't kill 'em,

17:52.029 --> 17:55.699
but a pair of 13-caliber tranquilizer
dart rifles will do the trick.

17:55.699 --> 17:57.951
- Why two?
-  Air guns don't have the range,

17:57.951 --> 18:00.537
and from that close,
the shots have to be simultaneous.

18:00.537 --> 18:03.415
- Pretty boy will do it with me.
- That's me. I'm pretty.

18:18.597 --> 18:21.100
Pair at the front gate is more difficult.

18:21.100 --> 18:24.186
We have to assume the house guard
has access to a monitor.

18:24.186 --> 18:26.063
If he sees 'em go down, it's over.

18:26.063 --> 18:29.608
So we need a van and 30 balloons.

18:38.158 --> 18:39.243
What's going on?

18:39.243 --> 18:41.495
One of the poker buddies
sent good-luck balloons.

18:41.495 --> 18:44.414
And a big box, back of the van.

18:45.457 --> 18:46.458
Check it out.

18:50.212 --> 18:51.839
Sign here, please.

19:06.770 --> 19:07.938
Good night, mate.

19:21.160 --> 19:22.369
<i>Four down, one to go.</i>

19:22.369 --> 19:24.371
How do you take out the guard
in the house?

19:25.205 --> 19:26.999
Easy. Joy buzzer.

19:48.395 --> 19:50.147
- Seem to be shocked to see me.

19:51.773 --> 19:52.900
We're in.

19:52.900 --> 19:56.904
We're both under the weather.
We're sorry to miss the game too.

19:57.404 --> 19:58.530
Thank you.

19:58.530 --> 19:59.990
Maybe next time.

20:03.285 --> 20:05.245
And Barry and Tina take their place.

20:05.245 --> 20:07.623
We hit the old coots with some darts.
They go nighty night.

20:07.623 --> 20:09.458
When they wake up, we're long gone.

20:09.458 --> 20:10.918
Easy as Sunday morning.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.504
Don't worry. It's just a sedative.

20:14.504 --> 20:16.423
You can't give us sedative.

20:17.341 --> 20:18.675
It could kill us.

20:18.675 --> 20:20.260
We have COPD.

20:20.844 --> 20:24.014
You said you wouldn't hurt us
if we made the call. Please.

20:24.014 --> 20:25.933
I think they're telling the truth.

20:25.933 --> 20:29.561
So? There's like a 5% chance
something happens to them,

20:29.561 --> 20:33.357
but 100% chance we don't get Boro
if they alert anyone to what we're up to.

20:33.357 --> 20:35.275
So let's stick 'em and get out of here.

20:35.275 --> 20:37.945
They're not spies.
They're just card players.

20:37.945 --> 20:39.947
They'll like the risk. They're gamblers.

20:39.947 --> 20:41.907
Emma's right. We can't shoot them.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.868
Aldon and I will sweep the house.
You keep watch.

21:09.851 --> 21:11.103
Borscht is in the bowl?

21:11.770 --> 21:12.938
Goulash is in the--

21:13.981 --> 21:15.148
I got nothing.

21:17.067 --> 21:18.610
Deposit all phones.

21:20.070 --> 21:22.406
Of course. My pleasure.

21:22.906 --> 21:23.865
<i>VoilÃ , monsieur.</i>

21:26.368 --> 21:27.202
Follow me.

21:30.372 --> 21:31.873
What the heck was that accent?

21:31.873 --> 21:33.083
Wakanda.

21:33.083 --> 21:35.127
It was the only study material
I could find.

21:35.127 --> 21:38.171
He only took your side
because you're his daughter, by the way.

21:38.171 --> 21:41.216
- He took my side because I'm right.
-  Whatever.

21:41.216 --> 21:43.260
Well, you're not much
of a sports fan, huh?

21:43.260 --> 21:45.971
- I was an NCAA athlete.
- NCAA?

21:45.971 --> 21:48.598
What sport? Asshole Olympics?

21:48.598 --> 21:50.017
I'm not engaging.

21:50.017 --> 21:52.227
Who says no to baseball with Dad?

21:52.227 --> 21:53.478
Who are you, Ray Kinsella?

21:53.478 --> 21:55.731
- You are living a Harry Chapin song.

21:56.773 --> 21:57.607
Shit.

21:59.192 --> 22:00.444
Not that it's your business,

22:00.444 --> 22:03.947
but I'm having some relationship issues
that I need to tend to this weekend, okay?

22:03.947 --> 22:06.700
Yeah, he knows that,
and he's worried about you.

22:06.700 --> 22:09.619
That's why he wanted to take you
to a ball game and talk.

22:10.329 --> 22:12.622
- Really? That's why he wanted to go?
- Yep.

22:12.622 --> 22:15.917
What an inconvenience
having a dad who cares.

22:15.917 --> 22:21.089
The only sporting event my dad took me to
was a cockfight in an abandoned Del Taco.

22:21.089 --> 22:23.091
Please, there's no need to fight.

22:23.091 --> 22:26.428
Old man, I will dart you
in your turkey neck.

22:37.564 --> 22:38.523
Wow.

22:39.107 --> 22:40.525
These things are endangered.

22:41.485 --> 22:42.694
Rich people.

22:44.237 --> 22:45.197
Mm.

22:52.579 --> 22:53.413
Whoa.

22:54.206 --> 22:56.291
Hey, check it out. Old fallout bunker.

22:59.586 --> 23:00.670
Weird.

23:01.421 --> 23:03.590
You've had it in for me
since we started working together.

23:03.590 --> 23:04.508
What is your problem?

23:04.508 --> 23:06.885
- You really wanna know?

23:14.935 --> 23:15.936
Shit.

23:16.436 --> 23:18.021
Balloons were your idea.

23:22.818 --> 23:25.570
Mm. Fruit cocktail.

23:26.321 --> 23:27.739
I love these things.

23:30.283 --> 23:31.660
1986.

23:31.660 --> 23:33.286
Plus, this is not yours.

23:33.870 --> 23:36.289
You have a tendency of taking things
that are not yours.

23:36.289 --> 23:38.333
- What's that supposed to mean?
- Well, you tell me.

23:48.343 --> 23:49.261
Hey!

23:51.847 --> 23:52.681
Give me that.

23:52.681 --> 23:54.182
- Get over there.

24:00.439 --> 24:02.399
The door is electric. It shorted out.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.569
It's set to default.

24:09.156 --> 24:10.240
We're locked in.

24:10.866 --> 24:14.286
Welcome, new friends and old.

24:14.828 --> 24:16.913
By taking your place at this table,

24:16.913 --> 24:19.916
you have joined an historic coterie.

24:20.750 --> 24:22.669
Czar Alexander sat here

24:22.669 --> 24:25.839
while Napoleon's army
knocked at the gates,

24:25.839 --> 24:29.050
Stalin while the Third Reich invaded,

24:29.050 --> 24:33.346
and as the American president
pointed missiles at Cuba,

24:33.346 --> 24:36.558
Khrushchev banged his shoe on this table

24:36.558 --> 24:38.852
because he did not pull
an inside straight.

24:41.146 --> 24:43.732
The game is five-card draw.

24:43.732 --> 24:46.026
Three raises, no limit.

24:46.026 --> 24:48.487
50,000.

24:49.696 --> 24:54.159
But first, our traditional drink...

24:56.620 --> 24:57.996
<i>moloko ottsa.</i>

24:58.997 --> 24:59.831
Mm.

25:05.420 --> 25:06.254
<i>Ura!</i>

25:06.755 --> 25:07.714
<i>Ura!</i>

25:10.050 --> 25:10.926
<i>Salud.</i>

25:12.594 --> 25:14.221
My Russian is rusty.

25:14.221 --> 25:15.514
<i>Moloko ottsa</i>?

25:15.514 --> 25:16.431
Father's milk.

25:16.431 --> 25:17.933
Vodka and yak semen.

25:24.105 --> 25:25.690
Let's play some cards.

25:29.903 --> 25:32.364
Controls are fried, and the door's steel.

25:32.364 --> 25:33.823
You're not getting it open.

25:33.823 --> 25:35.325
Can't get a signal in here.

25:40.830 --> 25:43.416
Hey, this probably runs
the bunker system's control.

25:46.336 --> 25:48.046
Oh, keyboard's Cyrillic. Not a problem.

25:50.549 --> 25:51.675
Yeah, system's shot...

25:53.218 --> 25:54.678
...and the door hydraulics are down.

25:54.678 --> 25:57.138
If the guards wake up
and we're still here,

25:57.138 --> 25:58.598
we go straight for the gulag.

25:58.598 --> 26:01.810
Okay, is it just me,
or is it getting unbearably hot?

26:01.810 --> 26:03.979
Well, that's 'cause the ventilation's
shutdown too.

26:03.979 --> 26:05.647
We won't have to worry about prison

26:05.647 --> 26:08.900
'cause the CO2 scrubber is not working,
and this place is vacuum-sealed.

26:09.776 --> 26:12.112
We're all gonna asphyxiate
long before we're found.

26:27.377 --> 26:29.379
Data extraction at 5%.

26:30.046 --> 26:31.923
Millions of miles before we sleep.

26:31.923 --> 26:32.966
If you can hear me,

26:32.966 --> 26:35.594
<i>Barry touch your chips,
and Tina take a sip.</i>

26:41.683 --> 26:42.851
All hands accounted for.

26:42.851 --> 26:45.020
AI's calculating strategic play.

26:45.020 --> 26:47.063
Okay, caught a break on the first hand.

26:47.063 --> 26:48.982
Barry's sitting pretty with three eights.

26:48.982 --> 26:52.360
<i>No one else has anything,
and nothing's coming up in the draw.</i>

26:53.111 --> 26:57.073
<i>They'll bet conservatively,
or if they're smart, just fold.</i>

27:07.792 --> 27:10.045
What's he doing? He's only got a pair.

27:10.045 --> 27:12.631
- I thought he was a card player.
- Apparently a bad one.

27:12.631 --> 27:15.425
He plays like this, he'll be out
of the game and gone with his phone

27:15.425 --> 27:17.010
way before we're done copying it.

27:17.010 --> 27:18.762
Okay, new plan.

27:18.762 --> 27:20.805
We cheat to help Cain.

27:23.058 --> 27:24.893
I already feel like I can't breathe.

27:24.893 --> 27:27.812
- You okay, Cool Breeze?
-  I don't like feeling confined.

27:28.396 --> 27:31.024
I read about this German guy
that lived in this tiny house,

27:31.024 --> 27:32.817
and he died on his own farts.

27:33.360 --> 27:36.279
Oh God, Ruth is feeling
a little hot underneath the collar.

27:36.279 --> 27:37.197
Who's Ruth?

27:37.197 --> 27:39.574
She's Ruth. Roo is short for Ruth.

27:39.574 --> 27:41.993
I thought it was a nickname
because you drive a Subaru.

27:41.993 --> 27:44.412
I drive a Subaru 'cause I'm gay.

27:45.080 --> 27:47.540
So you never bothered
to learn my real name?

27:47.540 --> 27:49.584
Nice kid you raised there, boss.

27:50.085 --> 27:53.463
Come on, open up,
you Soviet-era piece of garbage!

27:54.714 --> 27:55.674
You're not helping.

27:55.674 --> 27:57.676
No shit!

27:57.676 --> 27:59.177
I'm wasting oxygen.

27:59.177 --> 28:01.388
Six people in a room this size,

28:01.388 --> 28:04.224
normal CO2 output and O2 consumption,

28:04.224 --> 28:06.309
we've got two hours tops.

28:09.396 --> 28:11.106
Tell us about the bunker.

28:11.106 --> 28:12.982
It was here when we bought house,

28:12.982 --> 28:17.404
left over from when we thought
nuclear war was inevitable.

28:17.404 --> 28:19.447
- We thought it was kitschy.

28:19.447 --> 28:21.449
I told you not to eat that crap.

28:21.449 --> 28:23.868
I need some sugar,
or I'm gonna crash.

28:23.868 --> 28:24.953
Crash.

28:24.953 --> 28:26.121
That's it.

28:26.121 --> 28:29.582
Emma, check the computer
when it was fired up the last time.

28:31.626 --> 28:32.711
Um.

28:32.711 --> 28:35.880
According to its clock, October 8th, 1989.

28:35.880 --> 28:37.006
Okay, hear me out.

28:37.006 --> 28:41.261
This computer is vulnerable
to crashing from the Y2K bug.

28:41.261 --> 28:42.721
Nothing happened with Y2K.

28:42.721 --> 28:44.931
Because we knew there was a problem,
so we fixed it.

28:44.931 --> 28:48.935
I mean, from '97 to '99,
Y2K was just about all I worked on.

28:48.935 --> 28:50.061
And this helps us how?

28:50.061 --> 28:53.273
The computer runs the entire
bunker system, including the door.

28:53.273 --> 28:56.860
So when the clock flips forward
to the year 2000, which is double zero,

28:56.860 --> 28:59.529
the computer thinks it's 1900 and resets.

28:59.529 --> 29:02.115
And upon resetting, it opens the door.

29:02.115 --> 29:05.660
But it's not gonna think
it's the year 2000 for another 11 years.

29:05.660 --> 29:09.748
So I'll speed up the CPU,
so it'll cycle through the dates faster.

29:09.748 --> 29:11.583
We'd do this
in our high school computer lab

29:11.583 --> 29:13.042
to make video games go faster.

29:13.042 --> 29:14.544
It's not that hard.

29:18.590 --> 29:20.175
Cain has a pair of tens.

29:20.925 --> 29:23.428
Barry, Tina, stand pat,
so Cain gets the next card.

29:23.428 --> 29:24.637
<i>Another ten's coming.</i>

29:24.637 --> 29:27.348
Like Gandhi said
every day of his hunger strike,

29:27.891 --> 29:29.726
"Nothing for me, thanks."

29:29.726 --> 29:31.728
-  I'll stand.
- Three.

29:45.033 --> 29:45.867
Bets?

29:47.619 --> 29:51.539
Okay, everybody in.
Please show your cards.

29:54.584 --> 29:55.668
Mm. Mm.

29:58.713 --> 29:59.631
I win again.

30:03.885 --> 30:06.137
Yes, very lucky today, Mr. Khan.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.139
Quite unusual for you.

30:14.979 --> 30:18.358
Excuse me, sir,
but your associate has arrived.

30:20.944 --> 30:22.070
Boro?

30:25.740 --> 30:27.116
Son of a bitch.

30:27.826 --> 30:31.955
<i>Barry, Tina,
our target is right there with you,</i>

30:32.539 --> 30:34.123
and you are going to kill him.

30:36.584 --> 30:39.295
One moment, please.

30:42.131 --> 30:44.759
What are you doing here?
Is everything okay?

30:45.468 --> 30:46.302
We'll see.

30:46.302 --> 30:47.303
I received a call

30:47.303 --> 30:50.223
from a contact in the SVR
I've done business with before.

30:51.224 --> 30:54.143
He says he has information for us
about our troubles in Guyana.

30:55.854 --> 30:58.022
The host of your game
is a government friendly.

30:58.022 --> 31:00.608
Thought this would be
a good spot to speak privately.

31:01.693 --> 31:04.863
I just heard from
our mutual associate in Moscow.

31:04.863 --> 31:06.281
They will be here shortly.

31:06.906 --> 31:08.658
If you like, it would be my honor

31:08.658 --> 31:11.494
to deal you in
with half-a-million house marker.

31:11.494 --> 31:15.290
Thank you, but a man does not gamble
and wish for good fortune.

31:15.290 --> 31:17.041
A real man takes what he wants,

31:17.750 --> 31:18.710
creates his own.

31:19.794 --> 31:20.753
Very good, then.

31:24.966 --> 31:27.760
Okay, you know,
I can run extra power to overclock this,

31:27.760 --> 31:30.054
but I don't know
what kind of processor this is,

31:30.054 --> 31:31.723
so I could melt the chip.

31:32.599 --> 31:33.933
There's a barcode.

31:33.933 --> 31:35.268
Oscar's app.

31:39.814 --> 31:41.524
- Okay, does this help?

31:42.525 --> 31:46.195
It's an Intel i386 knockoff, 12 meg.

31:46.195 --> 31:47.822
Says it overclocks to 40.

31:47.822 --> 31:49.115
That'll do 'er.

31:50.408 --> 31:52.368
Aldon, do you know
what the squiggles mean?

31:52.869 --> 31:53.912
On it.

32:02.337 --> 32:03.880
Yes! It worked.

32:04.631 --> 32:07.425
Hopefully, this thing's calendar expires
before we do.

32:07.425 --> 32:10.428
Dad, you said you wanted
to talk about something. We have time.

32:10.428 --> 32:13.014
Time, but not the place.

32:13.014 --> 32:15.808
- Let's do it when we get out of here.
- Suit yourself.

32:17.685 --> 32:19.687
You know you can't make calls
from in here, Einstein.

32:19.687 --> 32:21.272
I'm checking that message from Carter.

32:21.272 --> 32:24.359
If I die in here, hopefully his last words
to me were something nice.

32:24.359 --> 32:25.944
Don't listen to it, sweetheart.

32:25.944 --> 32:27.737
I mean, this is stinking thinking.

32:27.737 --> 32:29.906
Look, let's just stay positive.

32:29.906 --> 32:32.700
Then when we get out of here,
you can talk to him in person.

32:32.700 --> 32:35.286
- Uh, I appreciate that, but I'm good.
- No, don't.

32:39.540 --> 32:41.125
You told Carter I kissed Aldon?

32:41.125 --> 32:42.752
You kissed the princess?

32:42.752 --> 32:44.003
- Sack tap.

32:44.921 --> 32:46.172
I'll see your 80,000.

32:47.715 --> 32:51.094
<i>Listen,
I have no idea why Boro's there,</i>

32:51.094 --> 32:52.178
<i>but the bottom line is...</i>

32:52.178 --> 32:53.096
Straight.

32:53.096 --> 32:55.556
<i>...you cannot let him walk out alive.</i>

32:55.556 --> 32:56.808
What do you have?

33:09.112 --> 33:10.279
That's impossible.

33:10.279 --> 33:12.031
How do the Americans say, huh?

33:12.532 --> 33:14.784
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

33:14.784 --> 33:18.287
No. The only reason we invite you
to this game is because you're terrible.

33:18.287 --> 33:20.665
- Ah.
- You're not winner. You're cheater.

33:21.749 --> 33:23.918
Hey, hey! Don't you call me a cheater.

33:23.918 --> 33:26.713
Why is he here?
He's not playing. They could be colluding.

33:26.713 --> 33:28.423
You insult that man, I'll kill you.

33:28.423 --> 33:29.465
Stop this now.

33:29.966 --> 33:31.300
There will be no fighting!

33:31.884 --> 33:34.345
This game is beyond reproach.

33:35.096 --> 33:37.640
In our history,
there has been but one cheater,

33:37.640 --> 33:41.394
Rasputin, the unscrupulous magician.

33:41.394 --> 33:43.229
And what did our forefathers do?

33:43.813 --> 33:46.607
They poisoned him
and drowned him in Neva River.

33:46.607 --> 33:49.652
That is what happens to cheaters,
and we all know it.

33:51.696 --> 33:52.864
Gentlemen,

33:53.364 --> 33:55.825
I think we could all use <i>une petite</i> pause

33:55.825 --> 33:57.201
and a drink, no?

33:57.785 --> 33:58.870
A proper drink?

33:59.454 --> 34:01.622
One that doesn't come from a yak's penis?

34:04.208 --> 34:06.961
<i>Monsieur</i>, do I detect
a Central American accent?

34:07.587 --> 34:12.717
Let me make you a rum <i>ponche</i>
with, um, a hint of sweet vermouth.

34:13.468 --> 34:16.554
One sip and you'll think you died.

34:18.097 --> 34:19.682
Smart kid.

34:21.267 --> 34:23.478
-  What the hell are you doing?
-  Taking Boro out.

34:23.478 --> 34:25.605
- With rum punch?
- With this.

34:26.230 --> 34:27.148
Give me a tumbler.

34:30.401 --> 34:31.778
Here you go.

34:31.778 --> 34:33.821
Did you find the liquor
you were looking for?

34:34.447 --> 34:35.782
Not yet.

34:37.533 --> 34:38.367
Ah!

34:39.535 --> 34:41.162
Here it is.

34:41.746 --> 34:43.456
Uh, fill me in, please.

34:43.456 --> 34:46.709
Ethylene glycol is found
in most household cleaners.

34:46.709 --> 34:48.961
Glycol will mix
with the mugwort in the vermouth.

34:49.629 --> 34:51.798
- Do you know what mugwort is?
- Only from <i>Harry Potter</i>.

34:52.882 --> 34:54.509
Mugwort is toxic

34:54.509 --> 34:57.470
when mixed with high doses
of certain accelerating agents.

34:57.470 --> 34:58.971
Like Ethel Merman-al?

34:59.597 --> 35:03.226
The alcohol will cause
slow and steady absorption.

35:03.226 --> 35:04.936
Boro will start to feel sick,

35:04.936 --> 35:06.312
and in 30 minutes,

35:07.271 --> 35:08.147
he'll be dead.

35:09.482 --> 35:12.819
Dot, how much longer
until Cain's phone's been copied?

35:12.819 --> 35:15.363
<i>We still need to find
that nuke after Boro's gone.</i>

35:15.863 --> 35:17.115
We're at 78%.

35:17.115 --> 35:18.783
<i>About 30 minutes.</i>

35:18.783 --> 35:20.493
That's cutting it close.

35:20.493 --> 35:22.078
We can't leave without the phones,

35:22.078 --> 35:24.038
and if Boro dies
before we're out that door...

35:24.038 --> 35:26.666
- They'll know we did it.
<i>-</i> Do you know what they'll do to us?

35:26.666 --> 35:29.293
They made us drink yak sperm
when they were being friendly.

35:29.293 --> 35:31.963
- It was kind of spicy.
- Why was it so spicy?

35:32.463 --> 35:34.006
Good evening, comrade.

35:34.549 --> 35:35.800
Welcome to my home.

35:35.800 --> 35:39.178
I have an area prepared
for you and Mr. Polonia

35:39.178 --> 35:40.763
where you can speak privately.

35:44.350 --> 35:45.685
What the hell's going on?

35:48.354 --> 35:49.564
How could you tell him?

35:49.564 --> 35:52.567
It was the best for him and you.

35:54.360 --> 35:56.445
Oh my God, this is what you wanted
to talk to me about.

35:56.445 --> 35:58.781
This is why you wanted to take me
to the game, to ease your guilt.

35:58.781 --> 36:01.576
The one that should feel guilty is you.
You kissed Aldon.

36:01.576 --> 36:05.288
Carter, he knew there was something up,
so I just confirmed his suspicions.

36:05.288 --> 36:07.206
It is not your place to confirm anything.

36:07.206 --> 36:10.501
I thought you and I were past this.
Why do you always have to invade my life?!

36:10.501 --> 36:12.545
Are you shitting me?

36:12.545 --> 36:16.174
Are you really complaining
that your dad is too up in your business?

36:16.174 --> 36:19.802
You are such a spoiled,
unappreciative brat.

36:19.802 --> 36:23.347
I've really had enough of you today.
What? What is your problem with me?

36:23.347 --> 36:27.810
My problem is that you have everything,
and you appreciate nothing.

36:27.810 --> 36:31.314
This guy chases you around,
desperate to connect,

36:31.314 --> 36:35.568
works with you, takes you to ball games,
worries about you nonstop.

36:35.568 --> 36:37.403
You know when I hear from my old man?

36:37.987 --> 36:40.781
Every five years when he needs
a letter for the parole board.

36:41.282 --> 36:43.284
Meanwhile, you have Dad of the Year.

36:43.284 --> 36:45.328
- Thank you, Roo.
- Shut up.

36:45.328 --> 36:47.079
You're as pathetic as she is.

36:47.079 --> 36:51.125
Chasing her around like you chase
her mother, you punk-ass bitch.

36:52.793 --> 36:55.421
Oh, don't you laugh, you sorry asshole.

36:55.421 --> 36:57.006
The one woman in the whole world

36:57.006 --> 36:58.799
you knew I wouldn't want you
to hook up with,

36:58.799 --> 37:01.135
and you did it anyway.

37:01.135 --> 37:02.762
What kind of best friend are you?

37:03.721 --> 37:05.139
Weak sauce, man.

37:06.140 --> 37:07.225
Weak sauce.

37:07.975 --> 37:10.436
It was not your best decision-making, sweetheart.

37:10.436 --> 37:12.521
I warned you that Carter could get hurt.

37:13.105 --> 37:14.899
And seriously, Aldon?

37:14.899 --> 37:19.195
Oh my God! It was just a kiss
in the heat of the moment, okay?

37:19.195 --> 37:21.739
He's a himbo in nice clothes,
and he helped Romi,

37:21.739 --> 37:24.158
and I had a moment of weakness.

37:24.158 --> 37:27.036
I fell for his stupid, cute face.

37:27.036 --> 37:30.164
Doesn't matter. It won't happen again.
It meant nothing, absolutely nothing.

37:30.164 --> 37:33.334
Would you stop saying that?
Because it meant something to me.

37:38.798 --> 37:40.049
Shit.

37:43.344 --> 37:45.763
Apologies for the last-minute request,

37:45.763 --> 37:48.182
but when we learned
you were in our country,

37:48.182 --> 37:49.976
we wanted to seize the opportunity

37:49.976 --> 37:52.436
to speak to a man
that we have long admired.

37:53.271 --> 37:55.064
How did you know I was here?

37:55.064 --> 37:58.192
We are SVR.
We know what you had for breakfast.

37:59.193 --> 38:00.403
Why are you here?

38:00.945 --> 38:04.657
It is our understanding
you're looking for a man named Finn Hoss.

38:06.367 --> 38:08.327
- How did you know that?
- We are SVR.

38:08.327 --> 38:10.288
We also know what you had for lunch.

38:12.331 --> 38:16.544
We have had a mole embedded in the CIA
for some time now, Songbird.

38:17.295 --> 38:19.588
We believe Songbird
will be able to ferret out

38:19.588 --> 38:21.590
the identity of Finn Hoss for you.

38:22.717 --> 38:24.385
Because you have long admired me,

38:25.594 --> 38:27.430
or because you want something in return?

38:28.014 --> 38:29.265
You call off the auction.

38:30.057 --> 38:32.727
All of the weapons that you make are ours.

38:33.644 --> 38:35.813
We will, of course, pay fair market value

38:36.564 --> 38:38.566
and give you the man you're looking for.

38:40.318 --> 38:44.655
Finn Hoss and Danielle DeRosa.

38:46.490 --> 38:47.325
Deliver them,

38:48.909 --> 38:50.619
no one else buys what I'm selling.

38:51.662 --> 38:54.248
Is there any way
either of you can angle yourself

38:54.248 --> 38:56.751
<i>so I can get a better look
at who he's meeting with?</i>

39:02.673 --> 39:03.507
Oops.

39:05.384 --> 39:07.803
-  Excuse me.
-  Allow me, madam.

39:07.803 --> 39:08.721
Thanks.

39:16.979 --> 39:19.732
Volek. Why is he having
a sit-down with him?

39:22.610 --> 39:23.903
<i>Merci.</i>

39:24.403 --> 39:27.406
<i>SeÃ±orita</i>, um, this is not rum punch.

39:27.990 --> 39:29.075
It is too sweet.

39:29.075 --> 39:31.786
I'm Indian. We like our sweets.

39:32.286 --> 39:37.375
And you are sweet. Maybe after game,
I can show you how sweet I can be.

39:37.375 --> 39:39.126
Thank you, but no.

39:40.711 --> 39:42.630
Well, if you're not going to have it...

39:44.965 --> 39:47.176
Sir? The cards?

39:47.176 --> 39:49.970
-  <i>Pass. Let Cain have the Jack.</i>
- I'll stand.

39:50.805 --> 39:51.889
I'll stand as well.

39:52.640 --> 39:53.474
Two.

40:04.985 --> 40:06.529
I'll bet 500,000.

40:09.573 --> 40:11.700
You bet out of order. It's bad form.

40:14.161 --> 40:14.995
But I'm in.

40:22.962 --> 40:23.963
Son of a bitch!

40:23.963 --> 40:26.590
- Yes, yes, yes!
- Hey! My drink!

40:26.590 --> 40:28.008
You've had more than enough.

40:28.717 --> 40:29.718
That's a problem.

40:29.718 --> 40:31.679
The shuffler shorted out.
Can't read the cards.

40:31.679 --> 40:34.765
Okay, well,
Cain is up a pretty decent amount.

40:34.765 --> 40:37.101
We just need him in the game
for another 25 minutes or so

40:37.101 --> 40:38.185
till his phone is spoofed.

40:38.185 --> 40:39.395
We should make it, right?

40:39.395 --> 40:41.939
The guy just bet half a mill
and barely won with our help.

40:41.939 --> 40:43.149
This is an issue.

40:46.277 --> 40:47.736
The shuffler is broken.

40:48.487 --> 40:52.366
I hope I am trusted enough
to finish out the game dealing by hand?

40:55.327 --> 40:56.912
This guy spills my drink,

40:56.912 --> 40:59.331
does not even have courtesy enough
to get me a new one.

41:02.001 --> 41:02.835
Ah.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.175
No, that's for our guest.

41:13.220 --> 41:14.472
It's mine now.

41:14.472 --> 41:16.724
<i>Okay, that's not good.</i>

41:16.724 --> 41:20.978
All right, guys,
let's just focus on ripping Cain's data.

41:20.978 --> 41:22.938
How do we keep Cain
in the game long enough

41:22.938 --> 41:25.191
to finish copying his phone
without the shuffler?

41:25.191 --> 41:26.358
I'll figure something out.

41:26.358 --> 41:29.069
But we've gotta get them out of there
before he dies,

41:30.029 --> 41:31.197
or they'll die too.

41:31.197 --> 41:33.407
I don't know how it happened.

41:33.407 --> 41:35.868
Kind of felt something
since we were in Moldova.

41:36.577 --> 41:39.788
Well, you're... You're interesting,
and I just like talking to you,

41:39.788 --> 41:43.459
and... I don't know. You're alluring.
You allured me.

41:43.459 --> 41:46.045
- I'm gonna be sick.
- Well, how do you think I feel?

41:46.045 --> 41:48.881
I want to take Emma away from
the nicest, sweetest guy in the world.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.966
- What does that make me?
- A dude with shit taste?

41:50.966 --> 41:53.302
-  It was a rhetorical question.
- Smoke.

41:53.886 --> 41:55.137
Oh man.

41:55.137 --> 41:57.932
The fan's wiring is overheating.

41:58.807 --> 42:00.893
- It's running too fast.
- And?

42:00.893 --> 42:02.144
And if we lose the fan,

42:02.144 --> 42:04.230
the CPU gets too hot,
and the whole thing burns out.

42:04.230 --> 42:05.356
And we all die in here.

42:05.356 --> 42:09.401
Everyone look for replacement wiring
in a radio or a walkie-talkie.

42:09.401 --> 42:11.111
Anything that can conduct.

42:19.078 --> 42:22.122
You sure sounded disappointed
that your daughter would stoop so low

42:22.122 --> 42:23.666
as to take an interest in me.

42:23.666 --> 42:25.501
- I thought we were friends.
- Don't get me wrong.

42:25.501 --> 42:26.710
You're a great guy's guy.

42:26.710 --> 42:28.462
But no one wants to have
their kid involved

42:28.462 --> 42:30.673
with a $10,000-suit-wearing gigolo.

42:30.673 --> 42:32.007
You know what I mean?

42:34.927 --> 42:36.804
Do you want to know why I dress nice?

42:37.346 --> 42:41.684
We were so poor growing up
that I wore nothing but hand-me-downs.

42:41.684 --> 42:43.852
Whatever fit and didn't have holes.

42:43.852 --> 42:46.063
Do you know what it's like
going to middle school in Dothan, Alabama,

42:46.063 --> 42:48.399
wearing your sister's
Backstreet Boys T-shirt?

42:50.734 --> 42:53.779
When Jane Dautrieve
asked me to the Fall Fling...

42:55.698 --> 42:56.949
...I was so excited.

42:57.533 --> 42:59.159
Then she asked
in front of the whole school

42:59.159 --> 43:00.911
if I was gonna wear
my brother's dress shoes

43:00.911 --> 43:03.289
'cause she heard that
we could only afford one pair.

43:03.289 --> 43:04.456
Everyone laughed at me.

43:05.040 --> 43:06.333
And my mom cut my hair,

43:07.167 --> 43:09.795
and, uh, we couldn't afford
to go to the dentist.

43:11.463 --> 43:13.674
But when I got hired by the CIA,

43:13.674 --> 43:15.342
I got my teeth fixed.

43:15.342 --> 43:16.677
I went to the salon.

43:16.677 --> 43:19.305
I bought expensive clothes
because I could.

43:19.305 --> 43:23.058
Yeah, I've slept with a lot of women
because they finally wanna sleep with me.

43:23.058 --> 43:24.852
But I've never had feelings
for any of them.

43:25.352 --> 43:27.062
I never wanted to see them every day,

43:27.062 --> 43:29.607
and I never thought about them
as soon as I woke up.

43:29.607 --> 43:32.318
But now that I do...

43:32.318 --> 43:36.071
...what, it's eighth grade all over again,
and suddenly I'm not good enough?

43:37.948 --> 43:39.908
- Screw both of you.
- Aldon.

43:39.908 --> 43:40.868
Nope.

43:45.623 --> 43:46.707
What do you got there, Roo?

43:46.707 --> 43:49.668
A crate's worth of kick-ass
if your kid wants some.

43:49.668 --> 43:51.378
No, I'm talking about in your hand.

43:52.004 --> 43:55.507
It's a can of fruit cocktail.
An aluminum lid is a decent conductor.

43:55.507 --> 43:57.968
So let's fight later. Fix the damn fan.

44:12.608 --> 44:13.609
Got your text.

44:13.609 --> 44:15.736
Your ace in the hole is here.

44:15.736 --> 44:16.820
All right.

44:17.363 --> 44:20.199
Cain's already dropped over three million
in just five hands.

44:20.199 --> 44:21.617
He'll be out of the game in minutes,

44:21.617 --> 44:24.703
and we need him and his phone
to remain where they are

44:24.703 --> 44:27.456
for ten more minutes
till we get all his data copied.

44:27.456 --> 44:29.291
Mm-hm. All right.

44:29.958 --> 44:31.460
Let me get a good look at the players,

44:31.460 --> 44:34.672
and I'll be reading them
like a copy of <i>Psychology Today</i>.

44:34.672 --> 44:36.924
Good Lord. What's up with that guy?

44:36.924 --> 44:38.967
Tina accidentally poisoned him.

44:38.967 --> 44:41.679
See what happens
when you bring me in late on things?

44:42.179 --> 44:44.556
<i>Raise... one million.</i>

44:46.392 --> 44:47.601
He's not bluffing.

44:47.601 --> 44:49.019
How are you so sure?

44:49.019 --> 44:52.606
Well, take a good look
at the poor bastard.

44:52.606 --> 44:55.526
<i>Thousand-dollar suit, $300 haircut.</i>

44:55.526 --> 44:58.529
<i>Before he got dosed,
he was very neat and anal,</i>

44:58.529 --> 45:00.572
but he just splashed the pot.

45:00.572 --> 45:03.575
He's so excited he's got a good hand
he got messy.

45:03.575 --> 45:04.493
Out.

45:04.493 --> 45:07.579
<i>Guys, fold like laundry,
or you're out of cash.</i>

45:08.122 --> 45:09.581
I'm out.

45:21.218 --> 45:22.052
I call.

45:22.720 --> 45:24.513
<i>Not a good move, Cain.</i>

45:38.444 --> 45:41.488
Seems your luck
continues to change, Mr. Khan.

45:41.989 --> 45:43.615
Just like famous cocktail,

45:43.615 --> 45:45.951
cream rises to top
with this white Russian.

45:46.952 --> 45:49.288
You have enough for one more hand,

45:50.289 --> 45:54.293
and then... you leave... like a loser,

45:55.377 --> 45:56.795
just like you came.

45:58.088 --> 46:00.716
<i>His speech is off,
but it's more than just the alcohol.</i>

46:00.716 --> 46:04.052
Look at his fine motor skills.
He can barely pick up the chips.

46:04.636 --> 46:06.889
This guy's gonna drop dead in minutes.

46:07.473 --> 46:10.809
His liver will expel all the toxins.
He'll turn purple and bloat.

46:10.809 --> 46:13.353
- They'll know he was poisoned.
- Mm.

46:16.023 --> 46:17.733
No!

46:20.360 --> 46:22.780
You know what they say about yak sperm?

46:22.780 --> 46:25.365
You don't buy it, you rent it.

46:29.244 --> 46:31.914
It's working fine.
It's getting close though.

46:32.414 --> 46:35.125
Am I the only one getting lightheaded?

46:35.125 --> 46:36.919
No. No, me too.

46:37.544 --> 46:39.713
I sure as hell
don't wanna die with you people.

46:41.089 --> 46:42.299
Yeah, I don't blame you.

46:43.550 --> 46:46.053
Aldon, I'm sorry for what I said.

46:46.637 --> 46:47.888
I was a jerk.

46:47.888 --> 46:51.558
And for what it's worth,
so was Jane Dautrieve in eighth grade.

46:52.351 --> 46:53.644
I'm sorry too, Aldon.

46:53.644 --> 46:55.646
I should've chosen my words more carefully

46:55.646 --> 46:58.398
because you would make
a wonderful boyfriend to any girl.

46:58.398 --> 47:00.567
It's just that
when it is your own daughter--

47:00.567 --> 47:02.110
Dad, stop.

47:02.110 --> 47:03.904
When will you learn?

47:03.904 --> 47:07.825
Where do you get off commenting
on anyone else's relationship?

47:07.825 --> 47:10.661
Roo was right. You've been
chasing after Mom for 15 years.

47:10.661 --> 47:12.538
Take the rejection and move on, okay?

47:12.538 --> 47:14.414
It's pathetic and embarrassing.

47:15.457 --> 47:17.084
- Oh, is that so?
- Yeah.

47:17.668 --> 47:20.796
Funny because... I was not rejected.

47:21.505 --> 47:22.381
What do you mean?

47:22.381 --> 47:25.050
You ever think about
why I didn't make the ops briefing?

47:26.260 --> 47:27.261
Oh shit.

47:27.261 --> 47:28.595
My man.

47:29.555 --> 47:30.514
No.

47:31.098 --> 47:33.976
On the ship.
Your mommy swabbed the deck with me.

47:33.976 --> 47:36.645
- No, this is not happening.
- She made me her first mate.

47:36.645 --> 47:39.523
Then we relaxed a little bit,
had some orange juice,

47:39.523 --> 47:42.192
and then she made me
her second mate if you catch my drift.

47:42.192 --> 47:43.986
God, why would she do that?!

47:45.654 --> 47:47.447
After all you put her through!

47:47.447 --> 47:49.992
After I went out of my way
to get Donnie to ask her out--

47:50.492 --> 47:51.493
Excuse me?

47:52.619 --> 47:53.579
What did you say?

47:53.579 --> 47:55.038
I told you she was the worst.

47:55.038 --> 47:57.082
Betrayed by my own daughter?

47:57.082 --> 47:59.418
Yeah, that's right. You wanna know why?

47:59.418 --> 48:03.755
Because every time I went to Mom's office,
I saw how Donnie looked at her,

48:03.755 --> 48:07.259
how he talked to her, made her feel good.

48:07.259 --> 48:10.470
So I told him what flowers she likes,
what food she likes,

48:10.470 --> 48:11.722
movies she likes.

48:11.722 --> 48:13.807
Foamed the runway straight to Mom's heart.

48:13.807 --> 48:14.933
And her noo-noo.

48:14.933 --> 48:17.519
I thought that we were finally
getting along much better<i>,</i>

48:17.519 --> 48:19.605
and you double-crossed me.
That's it, and that's all.

48:19.605 --> 48:20.981
Will you quit saying that?

48:20.981 --> 48:23.025
You didn't make it up.
It's from <i>Throw Momma from the Train</i>.

48:23.025 --> 48:25.944
One, I never saw that movie,
so I did make it up,

48:25.944 --> 48:27.821
and two, I cannot believe

48:27.821 --> 48:30.532
that you thought your mother
would be better off with someone else.

48:30.532 --> 48:32.075
Oh, I still do.

48:32.075 --> 48:34.369
The only mistake bigger than Mom
getting back together with you

48:34.369 --> 48:35.913
was marrying you in the first place.

48:36.830 --> 48:38.165
Oh!

49:08.779 --> 49:11.198
You should apologize to Father.

49:11.907 --> 49:13.241
Oh, now you say something.

49:13.992 --> 49:17.496
I will let you know
when we have the information you desire.

49:18.705 --> 49:19.790
Until we speak again.

49:23.460 --> 49:25.837
You must go now. I will call your car.

49:25.837 --> 49:27.589
Cain, we're done here.

49:28.173 --> 49:30.133
<i>We're at 98% downloaded.</i>

49:30.717 --> 49:32.010
You cannot let them leave.

49:32.010 --> 49:33.220
<i>Stop them.</i>

49:33.804 --> 49:36.473
I finally start to win,
and you want me gone. It's bullshit.

49:39.017 --> 49:41.311
- How many drinks has he had?
- Three or four at least.

49:41.311 --> 49:43.981
Three or four drinks? For a Russian?

49:43.981 --> 49:45.107
Doesn't make sense.

49:46.608 --> 49:48.986
Get up.
You've embarrassed yourself

49:48.986 --> 49:50.570
and disrespected the game.

49:51.613 --> 49:54.282
You are lucky
I don't take you outside and thrash you.

49:56.034 --> 49:57.619
What are these?

50:00.205 --> 50:01.581
He was cheating the whole time.

50:03.500 --> 50:04.668
99%.

50:04.668 --> 50:06.378
Dimitri does not cheat.

50:07.421 --> 50:08.588
Dimitri Malakhov,

50:08.588 --> 50:13.010
you have sullied
the integrity of our game and my home.

50:13.010 --> 50:15.554
You will now, like Rasputin,

50:15.554 --> 50:19.891
suffer the ultimate punishment
for your indiscretion. Guards!

50:25.772 --> 50:28.734
100%.
You have all of Cain's data on your phone.

50:28.734 --> 50:31.069
All losses are hereby refunded.

50:31.069 --> 50:33.780
The money will be wired
into your accounts.

50:34.364 --> 50:36.450
You all have my deepest apologies.

50:43.123 --> 50:45.876
After we get
our phones, should we try to follow Boro?

50:45.876 --> 50:49.337
Remember the last time
you tried to follow Stan Lee at Comic-Con?

50:49.337 --> 50:51.631
<i>I won't be able to bail you out this time.</i>

50:51.631 --> 50:53.675
He'll just go to his plane and fly off.

50:55.635 --> 50:58.138
We came for the data. We got the data.
Let's go.

50:59.473 --> 51:00.807
How'd you know about the poison?

51:00.807 --> 51:02.559
'70s movies, remember?

51:02.559 --> 51:04.519
A lot of James Bond.

51:04.519 --> 51:07.939
- How'd you get the aces up his sleeve?
- Five summers of magic camp.

51:16.907 --> 51:19.618
OTS is still cracking Cain's phone data.

51:19.618 --> 51:21.912
We'll have something
on Boro's location soon.

51:22.746 --> 51:24.998
Can't believe how close we were to him.

51:24.998 --> 51:26.291
We're gonna get him.

51:26.917 --> 51:28.293
It's just a matter of time.

51:28.835 --> 51:30.754
We gave 10% of the buy-in
to the Biryukovs.

51:30.754 --> 51:34.674
They believe you're foreign affiliates
of the Russian mob, so they'll be quiet.

51:36.134 --> 51:37.302
They were pretty upset.

51:37.803 --> 51:40.931
Something about a missing pet lizard.
Know anything about that?

51:41.973 --> 51:43.391
Yeah, I think maybe you do.

51:46.686 --> 51:49.856
Got a call from Customs
thanking you for some info you fed 'em.

51:49.856 --> 51:52.442
Took 'em to this fella
in a container of gym equipment

51:52.442 --> 51:53.527
shipped into Brooklyn.

51:53.527 --> 51:56.363
The owners of the company,
Twinning Formula,

51:56.363 --> 51:59.157
were indicted
for smuggling endangered wildlife.

51:59.157 --> 52:00.325
Assets frozen,

52:00.325 --> 52:02.619
business license pulled, computers seized.

52:02.619 --> 52:06.414
I got some intel from some sources,
then passed it on.

52:07.082 --> 52:09.709
- Are you telling me everything?
- Everything you want to know.

52:12.838 --> 52:14.965
Is that fruit cocktail?
That stuff isn't healthy.

52:14.965 --> 52:16.383
You're telling me.

52:17.217 --> 52:19.261
Neither is a team that hates each other.

52:19.261 --> 52:21.680
- What happened in that bunker?
- Don't worry.

52:21.680 --> 52:23.598
My team will take down Boro.

52:25.016 --> 52:27.144
The Russians are making overtures to Boro.

52:27.144 --> 52:28.603
All I do is worry.

52:44.911 --> 52:45.745
Dad, I'm sorry--

52:50.083 --> 52:53.503
Tina, there's something
I need to tell you.

52:53.503 --> 52:55.755
A secret I've been keeping.

52:55.755 --> 52:57.174
That you're a nerd?

52:58.508 --> 52:59.759
You went to magic camp.

52:59.759 --> 53:02.012
Your accent was from a comic book movie,

53:02.012 --> 53:06.349
and you have a T-shirt of one of
my favorite French-Canadian superheroes.

53:07.517 --> 53:09.227
You know Matter-Homme?

53:14.566 --> 53:16.359
Yeah, but...

53:18.820 --> 53:21.865
that is just scratching the surface.

53:51.686 --> 53:52.520
Dad.

53:53.396 --> 53:54.272
Come in.

53:58.777 --> 53:59.694
What's up?

54:00.278 --> 54:01.488
I brought you something.

54:02.113 --> 54:03.156
A check?

54:03.657 --> 54:04.783
What for?

54:05.367 --> 54:06.243
MyAisles.

54:07.619 --> 54:10.580
I used it the other day,
and it was really helpful,

54:11.957 --> 54:13.375
so I want to invest in it.

54:13.917 --> 54:15.168
Wow.

54:16.002 --> 54:18.255
This is a lot of money. I...

54:18.255 --> 54:19.589
I don't know what to say.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.676
I promise you
a great return on your investment.

54:22.676 --> 54:26.680
Oh, I don't care about the return
or the investment in MyAisles.

54:27.180 --> 54:28.723
I'm investing in you.

54:32.560 --> 54:36.398
You said something the other day
that really bothered me.

54:36.398 --> 54:38.692
Emma is the daughter I always wanted,

54:39.567 --> 54:41.486
and you're the son I always hoped for.

54:42.946 --> 54:44.072
I'm proud of you.

54:44.823 --> 54:47.158
Now maybe
I'm not mentioning it often enough,

54:47.158 --> 54:49.953
so if you're frustrated
or angry about anything,

54:49.953 --> 54:52.247
just come and talk to me.

54:53.290 --> 54:56.543
But don't bottle it all up
and then one day just explode at me.

54:57.294 --> 54:59.838
Um... sure, Dad. Yeah.

55:19.691 --> 55:21.026
Hey, old man.

55:21.526 --> 55:24.070
Rumor has it
you're sitting on some Yankee tickets.

55:24.821 --> 55:26.406
You're short a kid tonight,

55:26.406 --> 55:28.867
and I've been short a dad my whole life,

55:28.867 --> 55:31.828
so... what do you say we catch a game?

55:34.080 --> 55:36.624
- Let's do it.
- All right. Come on.

55:36.624 --> 55:38.084
What a surprise.

55:40.337 --> 55:41.171
Mm.

55:42.130 --> 55:44.007
You know, if you were my daughter,

55:44.966 --> 55:47.385
I would call you
more than once every five years.

55:47.927 --> 55:49.846
- Sack tap.
-  Ow.

55:49.846 --> 55:52.182
That's what you get
for being sentimental.

55:52.182 --> 55:54.351
Let's go. You're buying the beer.
