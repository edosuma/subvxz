I'd like a dessert
stuffed stick.

01:05.565 --> 01:07.358
{\an1}Hm.

01:07.442 --> 01:08.610
{\an1}Oops.

01:08.693 --> 01:09.402
{\an1}Okay.

{\an1}Here.
Come again.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.333
{\an3}Hiya, Fil.

01:20.747 --> 01:23.333
{\an1}What?

01:23.416 --> 01:24.959
Oh, it's you two.

01:25.043 --> 01:26.294
What do you want?

01:26.377 --> 01:28.630
Can we get two chicken
stuffed sticks?

01:28.713 --> 01:31.633
Yeah, sure.

01:31.716 --> 01:33.343
I like Stuff

01:33.426 --> 01:35.678
{\an1}Good for you.
Here. Come again.

01:35.762 --> 01:36.513
Now go away.

01:36.596 --> 01:38.681
Thanks, Fil.

01:38.765 --> 01:40.183
Yeah, and, uh...

01:40.266 --> 01:43.645
{\an5}Say, is that a little...

01:40.266 --> 01:43.645

Shut up, I say!

01:56.282 --> 01:58.201
I don't think
it's so funny!

01:58.284 --> 02:00.370
Go on, get out of here!

02:00.453 --> 02:02.038

You're not so funny!

02:04.707 --> 02:06.334
Ugh!

02:06.417 --> 02:07.794
They got me!

02:07.877 --> 02:08.961
They got me again!

Why do I always
fall for it, every year!

Oh, poor Fil.

02:21.641 --> 02:25.478
{\an1}Let's eat fast, Hef, so you can
drop me off at work, okay?

02:25.562 --> 02:27.021
Yeah, sure, Rock.

02:27.105 --> 02:28.815
Hey, don't look now, Rock,

02:28.898 --> 02:32.068
but isn't that Melba Toast?

02:32.151 --> 02:34.320
(gasps)
Oh, my gosh!

02:34.404 --> 02:35.405
I can't even look at her.

02:35.488 --> 02:36.906
I'm still in love
with Melba Toast.

02:36.990 --> 02:40.368
{\an1}Well, let's get her
over here.

02:40.451 --> 02:41.619
Hey, Melba!

02:41.703 --> 02:43.037
{\an1}Whoo-hoo!

02:43.121 --> 02:45.582
{\an1}Over here,
Melba, honey!

02:45.665 --> 02:47.876
Rocko's here!

02:47.959 --> 02:49.544

Hef, shut up!

{\an1}(laughing)

02:58.845 --> 03:01.890
Oh, don't be sore, Rocko.

03:01.973 --> 03:03.099
It's just a little prank.

03:03.182 --> 03:05.935
{\an1}Maybe you'll get me
sometime.

03:06.019 --> 03:07.520
{\an1}(laughing)

03:08.646 --> 03:11.482
{\an1}Huh? Hmm?

03:23.703 --> 03:25.580
{\an1}Oh, Rock.

03:25.663 --> 03:27.916
(fake laugh)

03:27.999 --> 03:30.335
{\an1}Yeah, that was
a real good one, Rock.

03:34.547 --> 03:35.423
{\an3}(whistling)

03:38.593 --> 03:41.095
{\an1}You better take it easy on
the practical jokes, Heffer.

03:41.179 --> 03:44.557
Someone might really
get you back someday.

03:44.641 --> 03:45.808
(tires screech)

03:45.892 --> 03:47.560
{\an1}Why don't you come in
and check out the new comics?

03:47.644 --> 03:48.436
{\an3}Sure, Rock.

03:50.063 --> 03:52.690
{\an3}Rocko!

03:52.774 --> 03:54.692
You got a letter here.

03:54.776 --> 03:57.278
Oh, boy!

03:57.362 --> 03:59.989
Gee, this letter's
postdated a month ago.

04:00.073 --> 04:01.991
I'm not a mailman!

04:02.075 --> 04:03.493
This is a place of business,

04:03.576 --> 04:06.704
{\an1}not a place for your
silly little pen-pal games!

04:06.788 --> 04:08.748
Sorry, Mr. Smitty.

04:08.831 --> 04:11.376
Hey, it's from my grandmother.

04:11.459 --> 04:12.168
{\an1}Oh, no!

04:12.251 --> 04:14.128
{\an1}Grandma's coming
for a visit

04:14.212 --> 04:16.297
and she arrives
this afternoon.

04:16.380 --> 04:17.548
{\an1}Could I have the afternoon off
to pick her up?

04:17.632 --> 04:19.425
Ha ha!

04:19.509 --> 04:23.513
{\an1}That's pretty funny, Rocko,
you're a crackup.

04:23.596 --> 04:24.180
{\an3}(laughing)

04:24.263 --> 04:25.390
She's arriving by plane.

04:25.473 --> 04:28.017
I've got to get someone
to pick her up.

04:28.101 --> 04:30.561
Ahem.

04:30.645 --> 04:31.771
{\an3}Forget it.

04:31.854 --> 04:34.190
{\an1}(chuckles)
Oh, come on.

04:34.274 --> 04:36.818
No way, Hef,
you're in a silly mood.

04:36.901 --> 04:38.820
I need someone
a little more responsible.

04:38.903 --> 04:41.197
Let me try Filbert.

04:41.281 --> 04:42.198
(phone ringing)

04:42.281 --> 04:42.865
Good morning.

04:42.949 --> 04:44.200
Stuff on a Stick.

04:44.283 --> 04:46.911
Stick your face
in our stuff.

04:46.995 --> 04:48.162
Hiya, Filbert.
I need a favor.

04:48.246 --> 04:52.208
Could you--

04:48.246 --> 04:52.208
Ha ha! Very funny!

04:52.291 --> 04:54.002
You're a funny guy!

04:54.085 --> 04:55.503
Ha ha ha! Ugh!

04:55.586 --> 05:00.383
What do you take me for,
an April Fools' idiot?!

05:00.466 --> 05:03.261
But very funny, Rocko!

05:03.344 --> 05:05.471
You're a real
character!

05:05.555 --> 05:09.350
Listen, friend, I don't go
for this holiday.

05:09.434 --> 05:11.352
(click, dial tone)

05:11.436 --> 05:13.938
I'm still available, Rocko.

05:14.022 --> 05:15.273
(whistling)

05:15.356 --> 05:18.109
Okay, Heffer,
but please,

05:18.192 --> 05:21.070
you have to behave.
No tricks.

05:21.154 --> 05:23.322
Don't worry, Rocko.

05:23.406 --> 05:27.618
I'll take real good care
of old Granny.

05:27.702 --> 05:29.162
(chuckles)

05:29.245 --> 05:31.622
Please, Hef. Please.

05:31.706 --> 05:32.290
No pranks.

05:32.373 --> 05:34.959
I'm just kidding, Rocko!

05:35.043 --> 05:38.546
{\an1}You can trust me, pal,
I promise.

05:38.629 --> 05:39.380
Shake.

Uh, no. It's...

06:08.951 --> 06:10.870
I'm... uh...

06:10.953 --> 06:12.830
Holy mother of Buddha,
did you get fat.

06:12.914 --> 06:13.998
Yellow, too.

06:14.082 --> 06:16.417
Don't just stand there.

06:16.501 --> 06:18.628
Let's get my bags, Rocko.

06:18.711 --> 06:22.423
Granny Rocko, wait!
You see... uh...

06:22.507 --> 06:26.302
How'd you get so fat?
You eat too much?

06:26.385 --> 06:28.721
You eating too many
hamburgers?

06:28.805 --> 06:29.931
Eating too much, eh?

06:30.014 --> 06:32.266
No. Granny Rocko, see,

06:32.350 --> 06:33.768
I'm not Rocko.

06:33.851 --> 06:34.644
{\an3}Hold it!

06:34.727 --> 06:36.646
What?!

06:36.729 --> 06:37.355
What's that?

06:37.438 --> 06:39.565
Uh, the escalator?

06:39.649 --> 06:41.609
I don't want my bags
on that thing!

06:41.692 --> 06:42.819
Take the stairs!

06:42.902 --> 06:45.029
It's okay, Granny Rocko,
they're perfectly safe.

06:45.113 --> 06:46.989
The stairs! The stairs!

06:47.073 --> 06:49.367
Take the stairs!

06:49.450 --> 06:50.618
Yes, Granny Rocko.

06:52.286 --> 06:56.499
{\an1}How much do you weigh now?
180? 220? 250?

06:56.582 --> 06:59.377
{\an1}Do you exercise?
How often? Where do you go?

06:59.460 --> 07:02.505
{\an1}Where's the triangle shirt?
No triangle?

07:02.588 --> 07:05.508
{\an1}You're too fat to fit into
the triangle!

07:05.591 --> 07:09.011
{\an1}Can't you go any faster?!
Why don't you pass this guy?!

07:09.095 --> 07:10.555
What's wrong with you, Rocko?

07:10.638 --> 07:13.266
You see, Granny Rocko,
I'm not--

07:13.349 --> 07:15.017
{\an1}Pass him!

Yes, Granny Rocko.

07:57.727 --> 08:01.147
That's the last time
I do you any favors.

08:01.230 --> 08:02.565
(Granny talking continues)

08:05.943 --> 08:07.570
Hmm.

08:17.830 --> 08:19.624
Gee.

08:20.875 --> 08:22.418
Hey.

08:22.501 --> 08:26.255
That old lady ain't
an old lady.

08:26.339 --> 08:28.424
She's Rocko.

08:28.507 --> 08:30.259
That sly dog.

08:30.343 --> 08:32.553
He thinks
he really got me.

08:32.636 --> 08:35.139
But it's me who's got him.

08:35.222 --> 08:38.683
And I really got him now.

08:39.936 --> 08:42.104
Rocko?

08:42.188 --> 08:43.688
What are you doing
in there?

08:43.773 --> 08:46.275
You arranging the furniture the
way I like it?

08:46.359 --> 08:48.653
(Heffer)
Yes, Granny Rocko.

08:48.736 --> 08:53.115
{\an5}(Granny)
Did you feed that dog of yours,
Spunky?

08:53.199 --> 08:56.160
Yes, Granny Rocko.

08:56.244 --> 09:01.582
Yes, Granny Rocko.

09:01.666 --> 09:03.042
(Granny Rocko talking)

09:03.125 --> 09:06.128
Yes, Granny Rocko.

09:06.212 --> 09:07.296
{\an1}(Granny)
Is he outside?

09:07.380 --> 09:10.633
Yes, Granny Rocko.

09:10.716 --> 09:15.012
{\an1}Hey, uh,
Granny Rocko?

09:15.096 --> 09:18.474
Could you come in here
for a moment, please?

09:18.557 --> 09:21.060
(devious chuckle)

09:21.143 --> 09:23.980
{\an5}(Granny)
In a minute, Rocko!
I'm baking!

09:24.063 --> 09:27.984
{\an1}Gee, I really would like you
to come out here for a second...

09:28.067 --> 09:32.238
Granny Rocko!

09:32.321 --> 09:33.739
{\an1}Ha ha!

09:33.823 --> 09:34.740
(Rocko)
I'll help you, Hef.

09:40.454 --> 09:41.497
You need help?

09:41.580 --> 09:43.457
What's going on?

09:43.541 --> 09:46.210
Who's coming over?

09:46.294 --> 09:47.503
{\an1}Grandma!

09:47.586 --> 09:48.754
Did you have
a safe trip?

09:48.838 --> 09:50.589
(Granny)
What? Who are you?

09:50.673 --> 09:52.883
Heffer? Is that you?

09:52.967 --> 09:56.721
No, Grandma, it's me,
Rocko. Remember?

09:56.804 --> 09:58.597
(Granny)
Heffer, did you lose weight?

09:58.681 --> 10:00.516
How can you wear
Rocko's shirt?

10:00.599 --> 10:03.144
What happened to
the suspenders?

10:03.227 --> 10:05.771
(whimpering, crying)

10:08.566 --> 10:11.319
{\an1}Don't tell me I don't know
my own grandson!

10:11.402 --> 10:14.238
But, Grandma, it is me!

10:14.322 --> 10:16.198
(talking continues)

10:16.282 --> 10:19.035
(whimpering)

10:19.118 --> 10:19.744
(talking continues)

10:24.790 --> 10:26.959
(windows shattering)

10:28.377 --> 10:30.087
Aah! Uhh! Uhh!

10:30.171 --> 10:31.714
Aah!

10:36.010 --> 10:37.720
Aah! Aah!

10:45.978 --> 10:47.772
Aah!

10:49.273 --> 10:50.983
Aah!

22:18.211 --> 22:20.380
{\an3}Let me out!

22:20.464 --> 22:20.547
{\an1}Hi, honey.

22:23.675 --> 22:25.427
How are you?

22:25.510 --> 22:26.303
Oh! My babies!

22:26.386 --> 22:28.972
(all)
Mama! Mama! Mama!

22:29.056 --> 22:32.642
Mama! Mama! Mama!

22:32.726 --> 22:36.021
Mama! Mama! Mama!

22:37.147 --> 22:42.319
{\an1}Oh, Rocko,
aren't they cute?

22:42.402 --> 22:45.363
Come to Mommy!
Oh, my little ones!

22:45.447 --> 22:48.283
{\an1}I'm so happy for you,
Filburt.

22:48.366 --> 22:50.285
Not now. I fainted.

22:50.368 --> 22:52.621
{\an1}No, you haven't,
you're still conscious.

22:52.704 --> 22:54.206
Oh, but I have.

23:09.888 --> 23:11.681
But your eyes
are open, silly.

23:11.765 --> 23:12.766
Oh, what do you know?

23:12.849 --> 23:14.351
{\an3}Go away.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.645
Oh, Daddy's just playing.

23:16.728 --> 23:18.396
He didn't think at all.

23:18.480 --> 23:19.981
Oh, yes I did.

23:20.065 --> 23:21.650
(kisses)

23:25.779 --> 23:28.323
No, no, go away.

23:29.825 --> 23:30.826
{\an3}Go home.

23:30.909 --> 23:33.995
