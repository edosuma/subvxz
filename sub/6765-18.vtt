00:17.065 --> 00:19.170
Coming!

00:24.025 --> 00:25.351
Good morning.

00:25.390 --> 00:26.506
Hey, what's the occasion?

00:26.550 --> 00:28.724
Oh, nothing. l was just
thinking about you.

00:28.836 --> 00:30.499
l thought maybe you'd be hungry.

00:30.542 --> 00:31.623
l scored some amazing scones.

00:31.668 --> 00:33.645
Yeah, now's not a good
time for me, Val.

00:33.681 --> 00:35.658
Why? ls somebody here?

00:35.694 --> 00:37.055
No, nobody's here.
l'm going out of town.

00:37.093 --> 00:39.198
Great. Can l come?

00:39.243 --> 00:41.452
-No.
-Well, why not? lt'll be fun.

00:41.494 --> 00:42.645
You don't even
know where l'm going.

00:42.689 --> 00:43.700
Okay, Dylan,

00:43.746 --> 00:45.036
where are you going?

00:45.076 --> 00:46.262
lt's none of your business.

00:46.305 --> 00:48.142
Just don't ask me any questions
right now, okay?

00:48.182 --> 00:50.124
Listen, Dylan, l can keep
a secret.

00:50.160 --> 00:51.171
Don't make me beg.

00:51.218 --> 00:52.985
That's my cab.

00:53.027 --> 00:54.143
Listen, l've got to go.

00:54.186 --> 00:56.163
At least say you're
glad to see me.

00:56.200 --> 00:58.177
Val, come on, do you
expect me to believe

00:58.213 --> 01:00.387
l'm the one guy on your little
bakery route this morning.

01:02.410 --> 01:04.343
l'll remember that.

02:12.884 --> 02:15.749
Pasajeros, bienvenidos
a Punta Brava.

02:15.786 --> 02:19.379
Thank you for flying with us
and we hope you enjoy your stay.

02:43.169 --> 02:45.295
Passengers for flight 32,

02:45.337 --> 02:47.031
your baggage is in baggage claim
area number four.

03:12.621 --> 03:16.988
Passenger Ramon Gutierrez,
please pick up a courtesy phone.

03:49.243 --> 03:51.403
Hotel Consuelo?

04:44.576 --> 04:45.974
Gracias.

04:46.010 --> 04:48.738
De nada, senor.

05:05.122 --> 05:09.489
He's uh, he's expecting me;
it's all right,

05:18.063 --> 05:20.257
Hey, Jones...

05:27.402 --> 05:29.266
Hey, Jones.

05:29.303 --> 05:30.860
Get the hell up!

05:30.904 --> 05:33.303
Get up!

05:33.339 --> 05:34.896
What happened here?!

05:34.940 --> 05:37.566
Not now, kid.

05:37.608 --> 05:39.472
Just come back later, all right?

05:41.477 --> 05:43.341
Stop it! Stop it!

05:43.378 --> 05:44.674
Are you crazy?

05:44.712 --> 05:47.270
Possibly. Why didn't you pick me
up at the airport?

05:47.314 --> 05:50.213
A setback, l had a setback.

05:50.249 --> 05:51.681
What?

05:56.252 --> 05:59.947
Did you happen to see
this foxy lady

05:59.988 --> 06:02.114
leaving Punta Brava

06:02.156 --> 06:03.486
with the other one of these?

06:03.524 --> 06:05.889
That is your setback?

06:07.626 --> 06:08.990
Oh, man, you just
go back to bed.

06:09.026 --> 06:10.458
l'll tell you what,

06:10.495 --> 06:13.121
l can find somebody competent to
do the job for what l'm paying!

06:13.163 --> 06:16.426
No, no, hold it, hold it,
hold it.

06:16.464 --> 06:19.124
Don't you cop attitude with me,
you understand?

06:19.166 --> 06:20.996
No, attitude!

06:21.034 --> 06:24.593
Now, l am way on top of this
case, you understand?

06:24.636 --> 06:26.102
Oh, yeah, l can see that.

06:26.138 --> 06:28.537
You ought to consider
yourself lucky

06:28.572 --> 06:31.437
to be working with
a pro like me.

06:31.473 --> 06:34.736
l'm a total professional.

06:34.776 --> 06:36.265
Look, you get dressed.

06:36.309 --> 06:39.208
And if they're out there, l want
to know it, l want to see it!

06:39.245 --> 06:40.268
Oh, they're
here, sport.

06:40.312 --> 06:43.177
And you'll see it.

06:47.350 --> 06:49.510
Well, well, wellie,
well, well.

06:49.551 --> 06:54.077
More big numbers posted for
the Andrea Zuckerman machine.

06:54.120 --> 06:56.246
Oh, my, dean's
list again?

06:56.289 --> 06:57.983
Boy, you're in a
real rut, Andrea.

06:58.023 --> 06:59.080
Look, don't make fun.

06:59.123 --> 07:00.817
This was my hardest
semester ever.

07:00.858 --> 07:02.119
Hannah was sick
throughout exams.

07:02.159 --> 07:03.455
Oh, that's right.

07:03.493 --> 07:05.858
Cindy said if it wasn't for
some hot shot med student,

07:05.895 --> 07:07.418
she could have developed
pneumonia, right?

07:07.462 --> 07:08.723
Did l say that to Cindy?

07:08.763 --> 07:10.889
Didn't hear it
from Brenda.

07:10.931 --> 07:12.261
Yeah, l might've been
exaggerating a little,

07:12.331 --> 07:14.127
and it wasn't like he
wasn't a good doctor,

07:14.166 --> 07:15.928
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
what is this that l see?

07:15.967 --> 07:18.729
ls that a little blush l see
on your cheek, chief?

07:18.769 --> 07:20.633
Could be she's having impure
thoughts about other men.

07:20.670 --> 07:22.034
Hot oil messages?

07:22.070 --> 07:23.559
You guys, all l was thinking was

07:23.605 --> 07:25.401
how l couldn't stop second-
guessing his diagnosis, okay?

07:25.439 --> 07:26.700
lt was just a joke.

07:26.740 --> 07:28.070
Well, be a little
funnier next time.

07:28.108 --> 07:29.369
-Oh, that hurt.
-Oh.

07:29.408 --> 07:31.102
Hey, hey, l've
got great news.

07:31.143 --> 07:33.110
l've got three
classes next semester

07:33.144 --> 07:34.633
that are almost exactly alike.

07:34.678 --> 07:36.645
-And that's great news?
-lt's awesome news.

07:36.679 --> 07:40.078
That means one final paper
for all three classes.

07:41.349 --> 07:42.906
Well, overachievers,

07:42.950 --> 07:44.746
it is now obvious
that Kelly has stood me up,

07:44.784 --> 07:46.080
so l'm gonna go

07:46.119 --> 07:48.609
to the campus and face the music
all by my lonesome.

07:48.654 --> 07:52.179
Not all of us have the
Steve Sanders course load.

07:52.222 --> 07:56.384
Hey, hey, l'm taking
aesthetics of golf, too.

07:56.425 --> 07:58.858
Come on, just
give it a chance.

07:58.893 --> 08:01.053
No, we're not turning
the Peach Pit After Dark

08:01.094 --> 08:02.492
into a hip-hop club.

08:02.528 --> 08:04.518
What's going on,
club chicks?

08:04.563 --> 08:06.928
Have you seen
Kelly anywhere?

08:06.964 --> 08:08.123
Yeah, on campus.

08:08.165 --> 08:09.654
She was going to the
Administration Building.

08:09.699 --> 08:11.632
l guess something wasn't right
with her psych tutorial.

08:11.667 --> 08:13.691
But she's probably
home by now.

08:13.735 --> 08:15.395
Thanks. See ya.

08:15.436 --> 08:17.869
-See ya.
-Bye.

08:17.904 --> 08:19.461
So, what were you saying?

08:19.505 --> 08:20.698
Hip-hop is boring.

08:20.739 --> 08:21.796
Oh, but alternative rock

08:21.840 --> 08:24.137
with the same droning guitars

08:24.175 --> 08:25.971
and hoarse singer screaming
about how things suck,

08:26.009 --> 08:28.340
that's invigorating?

08:28.377 --> 08:30.139
Things do suck.

08:30.178 --> 08:31.542
Tough.

08:31.580 --> 08:32.739
We're not booking
any downer bands.

08:32.780 --> 08:34.405
Okay.

08:34.447 --> 08:37.243
What does it take to evolve?

08:37.316 --> 08:39.044
Discipline and and courage.

08:39.083 --> 08:41.017
What can you achieve?

08:41.052 --> 08:42.881
Control, confidence

08:42.919 --> 08:47.115
and a first peek at your
shining self...

08:47.155 --> 08:50.054
Okay, voyagers, let's review...

08:50.090 --> 08:51.556
Don't turn that off
on my account.

08:51.592 --> 08:53.821
How long have you
been spying?

08:53.860 --> 08:56.020
l'd prefer to think of it
as adoring from afar.

08:56.061 --> 08:59.051
l've always liked you on
the floor in weird positions.

08:59.096 --> 09:01.222
You are definitely
in that category

09:01.264 --> 09:03.026
Professor Finley calls
''the rough beast.''

09:03.065 --> 09:04.759
l can live with that.

09:04.799 --> 09:07.096
l heard there was some problem
today with his tutorial.

09:07.133 --> 09:09.725
Yeah, the Faculty Council
decided that he of all people

09:09.768 --> 09:11.701
is not worthy
of job security,

09:11.737 --> 09:14.034
academic recognition,
or a pay raise.

09:14.072 --> 09:16.005
Are you telling me Patrick
Finley was denied tenure?

09:16.039 --> 09:17.699
-Mm-hmm.
-ln my task force report,

09:17.740 --> 09:20.332
he had the highest popularity
rating of any professor.

09:20.375 --> 09:21.773
l know, it's true.

09:21.810 --> 09:24.777
And now he won't do any
of his tutorial teachings

09:24.811 --> 09:26.107
until he gets an
immediate appeal.

09:26.145 --> 09:27.736
Well, l'm sorry, Kel,
and l hope l don't

09:27.779 --> 09:29.006
embarrass you, but l think

09:29.047 --> 09:30.911
l'm going to have
to twist the dean's arm

09:30.948 --> 09:32.812
on this one personally
until he gets that appeal.

09:32.849 --> 09:35.078
Oh, you approve
of that, do you?

09:35.117 --> 09:36.515
Yes.

09:36.552 --> 09:38.644
l thought l was going to have
to persuade you much harder

09:38.686 --> 09:40.550
-to get you involved.
-Well, in that case,

09:40.587 --> 09:42.952
forget l said anything
and persuade away.

10:03.968 --> 10:05.434
Check it out.

10:05.469 --> 10:08.027
They took a year lease.

10:08.070 --> 10:12.232
Yeah, that's Kevin
and that's Suzanne.

10:12.306 --> 10:13.966
No, no, now they
call themselves

10:14.008 --> 10:15.634
Karl and Kitty Cavendish.

10:15.675 --> 10:16.834
Cute, huh?

10:16.876 --> 10:19.638
Erica is still Erica
as far as l can tell.

10:19.677 --> 10:20.870
l mean she doesn't
have an alias.

10:20.912 --> 10:22.242
So, what are they
doing down here?

10:22.279 --> 10:23.677
Business opportunities.

10:23.713 --> 10:27.647
They arrived about a week ago
from Santos, Brazil, man.

10:27.682 --> 10:29.649
They had an import company,

10:29.684 --> 10:32.049
but you can bet that it was
a cover for smuggling.

10:32.085 --> 10:33.142
Drugs?

10:33.185 --> 10:34.549
Why not?

10:34.587 --> 10:37.054
The way l figure it either
got too dry or too hot,

10:37.088 --> 10:38.816
and they just went looking
for greener pastures.

10:38.856 --> 10:41.016
Speaking of green,
where's my cash?

10:41.057 --> 10:43.149
There's 50 grand
in a local bank,

10:43.191 --> 10:45.351
but the big bucks are stashed
in another bank

10:45.393 --> 10:46.654
with a secret account
number somewhere.

10:46.694 --> 10:48.126
That's what we're
gonna flush out.

10:48.161 --> 10:50.492
-How do you know all that?
-How do l know all that?

10:50.529 --> 10:52.860
Right now, l got a nice
juicy wire tap

10:52.897 --> 10:53.885
on their phone line, okay?

10:53.932 --> 10:55.592
l can tell you
all sorts of stuff.

10:55.632 --> 10:56.723
This guy ''Karl''

10:56.767 --> 10:58.996
thinks he's Captain Kidd,
and he's into, uh...

10:59.035 --> 11:02.002
blowing his big bucks
on pirate collectibles.

11:02.037 --> 11:04.163
Kitty, on the other hand,
she's just happy

11:04.204 --> 11:06.137
that she's not sleeping
with Karl, is that enough?

11:06.172 --> 11:08.503
Serves her right. What's next?

11:08.540 --> 11:10.166
l've been thinking
on that a little.

11:10.207 --> 11:12.106
A little?
You've been thinking a little?

11:12.143 --> 11:13.200
You called me
all the way down here,

11:13.310 --> 11:14.367
you haven't
even got a plan?

11:14.411 --> 11:16.139
Hey, l did. You dig?

11:16.178 --> 11:17.337
So what happened?

11:17.378 --> 11:18.742
Carrie Anne-- she bailed.

11:18.780 --> 11:21.713
Without the right foxy lady,
this plan ain't going to fly.

11:21.748 --> 11:23.647
Well, get another one, genius.

11:23.683 --> 11:26.809
l wish.
She was one in a million.

11:29.119 --> 11:30.608
There's Erica.

11:33.488 --> 11:35.216
l'm telling you,

11:35.256 --> 11:36.449
she could lie
like a rug,

11:36.490 --> 11:39.082
tease like a sleaze.

11:39.125 --> 11:41.456
How am l going
to find another Carrie Anne?

11:49.865 --> 11:51.559
Hello.

11:51.599 --> 11:53.725
Dylan?

11:53.767 --> 11:55.631
Listen, l'm sorry.
l can't hear you.

11:55.668 --> 11:58.033
Don't hang up. Just listen.

11:58.070 --> 12:00.128
After this morning?
Fat chance!

12:00.171 --> 12:02.161
l'm in Punta Brava, okay?

12:02.206 --> 12:03.172
l really need you.

12:03.206 --> 12:05.036
Well, l don't care.

12:05.074 --> 12:07.371
l want you to come down.
l'll pay.

12:07.409 --> 12:09.069
Oh, now you want me
to come down.

12:09.110 --> 12:10.667
Listen, l'm sorry.

12:10.711 --> 12:12.007
Come on, Val.

12:12.045 --> 12:13.443
Look, there's a flight
leaving tomorrow morning.

12:13.479 --> 12:15.139
Call the airlines
and get a reservation.

12:15.180 --> 12:17.170
Right?
And why would l want to do that?

12:17.215 --> 12:19.546
Valerie, you coming?

12:19.583 --> 12:23.108
Yeah. l'll be there in a second.

12:23.151 --> 12:24.879
Listen, Dylan, l can't talk.

12:24.920 --> 12:26.580
l promised the Walshes
l'd go out tonight.

12:26.620 --> 12:29.485
Jim's firm's being honored by
the Chamber of Commerce. Okay?

12:29.522 --> 12:31.113
Yeah, you're right.
How can l compete with that?

12:31.156 --> 12:32.122
Have fun.

12:32.157 --> 12:34.056
Dylan, what's going on?

12:34.092 --> 12:35.524
What's the difference?

12:35.559 --> 12:37.458
You can't talk, right?

12:37.494 --> 12:39.120
Honey, just...
just leave the knot.

12:39.161 --> 12:40.957
lt's not the tie
l'm worried about.

12:40.996 --> 12:42.326
lt's getting there on time.

12:44.298 --> 12:45.730
Oh, there she is.
Come on, Val. Let's go.

12:45.765 --> 12:47.197
You look lovely.

12:47.300 --> 12:48.197
Thank you. Um...

12:48.300 --> 12:49.960
Can you guys go without me?

12:50.002 --> 12:50.968
What?

12:51.002 --> 12:52.730
-Are you okay?
-Yeah, l'm fine.

12:52.769 --> 12:54.827
lt's just my friend Ginger
from back home is on the phone,

12:54.871 --> 12:56.804
and she's in a really bad way.

12:56.839 --> 12:58.806
l might have
to fly out tomorrow morning.

12:58.840 --> 13:00.067
To Buffalo?

13:00.108 --> 13:01.540
Yeah.

13:01.575 --> 13:04.269
Um... l'm
really sorry, Jim.

13:04.310 --> 13:06.368
Have a wonderful time.
Okay, guys?

13:06.411 --> 13:08.105
Valerie...

13:08.145 --> 13:09.543
Never a dull moment.

13:09.580 --> 13:10.637
You want me to go upstairs

13:10.680 --> 13:11.646
and see what's
really going on, Dad?

13:11.681 --> 13:13.477
No. Because l don't care.

13:13.515 --> 13:14.913
Well, l do.

13:14.950 --> 13:16.678
Why would she lie?

13:16.717 --> 13:18.308
Because she has no shame.

13:18.351 --> 13:20.511
Let's just go, okay?

13:24.389 --> 13:26.117
Okay, Dylan. l'm yours.

13:26.156 --> 13:27.645
What do you want me to do?

13:27.691 --> 13:28.816
Now you're talking.

13:28.858 --> 13:30.825
Grab a pencil. Here's the plan.

13:47.436 --> 13:50.699
Flight number 22,
destination Los Angeles...

13:50.737 --> 13:53.568
Hey, Val's plane is here.
She's stuck in customs.

13:53.606 --> 13:55.163
What else is new?
Can l get you something?

13:55.274 --> 13:56.934
No. Just my eight
million bucks, please.

13:56.975 --> 13:58.271
That's what
we're here for.

13:58.308 --> 13:59.467
Now, look. Put
this on, okay?

13:59.510 --> 14:01.477
You're going to play
the part of a valet,

14:01.511 --> 14:02.875
so you might as
well start wearing it.

14:02.912 --> 14:04.606
You really think
it's a good idea

14:04.646 --> 14:06.579
for all three of us
to be seen together?

14:06.614 --> 14:08.740
Kid, l've got my ear on
the Cavendishes, all right?

14:08.782 --> 14:10.510
Now, you just pay
attention to me,

14:10.550 --> 14:12.813
do what l tell you, and
we'll stay one step ahead.

14:12.851 --> 14:14.112
Yeah, well, excuse me

14:14.218 --> 14:15.741
if you don't inspire a great
amount of confidence, Jones.

14:15.786 --> 14:17.377
That's because you haven't
seen me in action, pal.

14:17.421 --> 14:18.682
What was yesterday?

14:18.721 --> 14:21.813
Look, when l was with the Bureau
doing Special Ops

14:21.856 --> 14:24.050
with Christine all the time,
l mean, she knew

14:24.091 --> 14:26.456
that if you got your
beer nuts in the fire,

14:26.492 --> 14:28.652
that l was the best man
to call-- fuzzy old me.

14:28.693 --> 14:29.818
Well, if you're so great,

14:29.861 --> 14:30.918
how come you're not still
with the Bureau?

14:30.961 --> 14:32.086
Half my jobs are
with the government.

14:32.129 --> 14:34.494
Who do you think they get to
clean up their dirty work, huh,

14:34.531 --> 14:35.497
when they're not allowed to?

14:35.532 --> 14:37.897
l mean, you name it,
kid, l have done it.

14:37.933 --> 14:40.230
l'm a master.
You are working with a master.

14:40.268 --> 14:42.132
Hey, for what l'm paying you,
you better be.

14:42.202 --> 14:43.725
l've got a problem here, okay?

14:43.769 --> 14:44.757
lt gives me the heebie-jeebies

14:44.804 --> 14:45.770
working with an amateur.

14:45.804 --> 14:47.236
Now, this little sweetie pie
of yours

14:47.272 --> 14:49.364
better be up
to major league ball,

14:49.406 --> 14:51.236
or there's going
to be a delay of game.

14:51.274 --> 14:52.900
Don't you worry
about my girl Val.

14:52.942 --> 14:54.238
She's a player.

14:54.276 --> 14:55.401
She better be.

14:55.444 --> 14:57.707
There she is.

14:57.745 --> 15:00.144
-Oh, my!
-Mm-hmm.

15:00.246 --> 15:03.907
Does she know that l'm supposed
to be the boyfriend?

15:03.948 --> 15:05.847
Just cut the static. Why don't
you give her a test run?

15:08.218 --> 15:09.514
Valerie!

15:09.552 --> 15:14.180
Oh, God! l've missed you, baby,
so much!

15:14.221 --> 15:16.949
How are you?

15:16.989 --> 15:18.182
Hi.

15:24.394 --> 15:26.691
l missed you, too.

15:26.728 --> 15:29.320
Jeeves, where
are your manners?

15:29.363 --> 15:32.558
Pick up the lady's bags and
take us to the Palmilla Hotel.

15:32.599 --> 15:34.327
Now.

15:34.366 --> 15:36.731
So, major league enough
for you?

15:39.970 --> 15:42.267
Hall of Fame
potential.

15:42.305 --> 15:43.896
Take the bags.

15:45.474 --> 15:47.498
Please. There's nothing

15:47.541 --> 15:49.633
you or l can do
about his appeal.

15:49.676 --> 15:51.802
Tenure is in the hands
of the Faculty Council,

15:51.844 --> 15:53.674
and they decided
Finley didn't deserve it.

15:53.711 --> 15:55.041
That doesn't make sense.

15:55.079 --> 15:57.239
How can we afford not to
keep our best teachers here?

15:57.280 --> 15:59.645
We're going to lose him
if he isn't reconsidered.

15:59.682 --> 16:02.410
Brandon, Chancellor Arnold
recruited Finley himself,

16:02.450 --> 16:04.212
but these things happen.
Now, let's stop...

16:04.251 --> 16:06.218
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
What happens?

16:06.252 --> 16:08.844
He's not academic enough
for the other teachers?

16:08.887 --> 16:10.979
He didn't publish
enough scholarly papers?

16:11.022 --> 16:12.511
Well, in fact, the publishing
thing was a problem.

16:12.556 --> 16:14.648
He was supposed to be working
on a book last summer

16:14.691 --> 16:16.214
and instead started
with these seminars.

16:16.258 --> 16:18.521
And the other teachers
became jealous

16:18.560 --> 16:20.186
that he was making money?

16:20.228 --> 16:21.251
No. l think they're concerned

16:21.294 --> 16:23.488
that he's using his classroom
to develop new converts.

16:23.530 --> 16:25.429
That's a little harsh,
don't you think?

16:25.464 --> 16:28.295
Brandon, his teaching style
borders on the messianic.

16:28.333 --> 16:30.425
Why? Because his
students like him?

16:30.467 --> 16:33.059
Dean, when the chancellor
appointed me to the task force,

16:33.102 --> 16:35.433
we made a commitment to upgrade
undergraduate education.

16:35.470 --> 16:36.766
What happened to that?

16:36.804 --> 16:40.294
Okay. l shouldn't say this, and
will deny it if it's repeated,

16:40.340 --> 16:42.830
but last year,
we had complaints

16:42.875 --> 16:44.739
from some parents
of Finley's students.

16:44.775 --> 16:46.605
Some serious allegations

16:46.643 --> 16:48.701
about conduct during
a weekend retreat.

16:48.744 --> 16:50.074
What kind of allegations?

16:50.146 --> 16:52.079
Look. l've said
too much already.

16:52.147 --> 16:53.704
l'll tell you what.

16:53.747 --> 16:55.805
Go meet the man, and see
for yourself what he's like,

16:55.849 --> 16:57.839
and l'll work on it
from this end.

16:57.884 --> 17:00.715
Maybe we can work something out
for Finley this semester.

17:00.752 --> 17:03.242
Thanks. l appreciate it.

17:06.622 --> 17:08.953
l take it this hotel's going
to be a step up

17:08.990 --> 17:11.013
from that fleabag
l found you in, Jones.

17:11.058 --> 17:12.648
Hey, look, l was trying
to keep the expenses down.

17:12.692 --> 17:14.124
They come out of your cut,
not mine.

17:14.160 --> 17:15.455
What a guy.

17:15.493 --> 17:16.618
Of course l am.

17:16.661 --> 17:19.287
From now on, for appearance's
sake, we go first-cabin.

17:19.329 --> 17:20.795
We're a filthy rich couple

17:20.830 --> 17:23.662
staying at the best resort
in Punta Brava,

17:23.699 --> 17:26.393
just up the beach
from loveable Kitty and Karl.

17:26.433 --> 17:27.729
Works for me.

17:27.768 --> 17:30.133
Since an old Air Force buddy
runs this joint,

17:30.170 --> 17:31.830
our credit's good.

17:31.870 --> 17:33.359
Shoulders back, Jeeves!

17:33.405 --> 17:35.838
They're expecting us.

17:38.808 --> 17:42.708
Welcome to the Hotel Palmilla.

17:42.744 --> 17:45.041
Senor and Senora Jones,
so good to see you.

17:45.112 --> 17:46.942
Amigo! Marco!

17:46.979 --> 17:49.378
Glad to see you.

17:50.148 --> 17:52.012
Senorita.

17:52.049 --> 17:54.039
l'll have your bags taken
to your suite

17:54.117 --> 17:55.378
-at once.
-Oh, just get my

17:55.418 --> 17:56.907
things; our manservant here

17:56.952 --> 17:58.782
will take care of the lady's.

17:58.820 --> 18:01.049
Excellente.
Then follow me. Vamos.

18:16.198 --> 18:19.495
Oh, it's great,
it's really warm.

18:26.304 --> 18:29.703
Look. Thanks for coming.

18:29.738 --> 18:32.534
No problem. lt'll be fun.

18:32.574 --> 18:35.803
l don't know about that,
but l do appreciate it.

18:35.842 --> 18:37.638
l should have made you beg.

18:37.677 --> 18:38.768
Valerie!

18:38.811 --> 18:40.209
Cut the distractions.

18:40.245 --> 18:42.337
You and l got a date with
the Cavendishes for cocktails.

18:42.379 --> 18:43.345
Now, let's go.

18:43.380 --> 18:44.539
l'm all yours.

18:44.581 --> 18:47.275
Thank you.

18:47.316 --> 18:49.647
Hey!

18:49.684 --> 18:50.980
What am l supposed to do?

18:51.018 --> 18:55.544
l would suggest you find
some very large checkers.

19:14.765 --> 19:16.254
Okay, rehearsal's over.

19:16.300 --> 19:18.062
We got a bogey at 12:00.

19:18.101 --> 19:19.965
Now, when you catch
the mister's eye,

19:20.035 --> 19:21.524
you just tease his socks off.

19:21.570 --> 19:23.196
What about the wife?

19:23.238 --> 19:24.761
She won't be around.

19:25.973 --> 19:27.769
-Oh!
-Oh!

19:27.807 --> 19:28.773
Oh, my God!

19:28.808 --> 19:29.865
l am so sorry.

19:29.908 --> 19:31.465
Jones, what did you just do?

19:31.509 --> 19:32.702
l'm soaking wet!

19:32.743 --> 19:34.539
Senora, please. There
is a bathroom. Come quickly.

19:34.577 --> 19:35.804
Jonesy, do something.

19:35.845 --> 19:36.970
l will, l will. Don't worry.

19:37.079 --> 19:38.636
-l'll get a table, hon.
-Marcos.

19:38.680 --> 19:40.146
Their bill is on me
tonight, all right?

19:40.181 --> 19:41.511
Dinner, cocktails,
whatever.

19:41.549 --> 19:43.379
l'm sorry.

19:43.416 --> 19:45.076
Please, sit and be our guest.

19:45.117 --> 19:47.084
That won't be necessary,
thank you.

19:47.118 --> 19:50.745
Please. lt would make me feel
so much better.

19:55.056 --> 19:57.489
What the hell?

19:57.524 --> 19:59.184
You know, for such a young lady,

19:59.226 --> 20:01.193
you really do have
impeccable manners.

20:01.227 --> 20:03.524
Thank you.

20:05.363 --> 20:06.989
l'm Val.

20:07.030 --> 20:07.996
Karl.

20:08.098 --> 20:09.724
And this

20:09.765 --> 20:11.561
is my... Jonesy,

20:11.600 --> 20:12.657
what are you anyway?

20:12.700 --> 20:15.496
l'm a very clumsy
significant other.

20:15.535 --> 20:17.195
J.J. Jones. Never too busy.

20:17.236 --> 20:18.133
Karl Cavendish.

20:18.170 --> 20:19.193
Karl... Karl...?

20:19.238 --> 20:20.568
Cavendish.

20:20.605 --> 20:22.231
Oh.

20:22.273 --> 20:24.933
Jonesy, what is so funny?

20:24.974 --> 20:25.940
Well, that's just

20:25.975 --> 20:27.874
the perfect Punta Brava name,

20:27.909 --> 20:29.000
isn't it? Hmm?

20:29.077 --> 20:30.008
l mean,

20:30.077 --> 20:32.010
this whole place traces back

20:32.046 --> 20:33.842
-to the pirate...
-Thomas...

20:33.880 --> 20:35.506
Thomas Cavendish. Right. Yeah.

20:35.547 --> 20:37.673
Have a seat. Good.

20:37.715 --> 20:38.942
Wow. So, um...

20:38.983 --> 20:40.711
are you related?

20:40.751 --> 20:44.014
No, no. l mean,
not that l would mind.

20:44.120 --> 20:45.814
When your last name
is Cavendish,

20:45.854 --> 20:48.548
you develop a taste
for outlaw history.

20:48.589 --> 20:51.852
ln fact, l'm a...

20:51.891 --> 20:53.414
big collector
of piratical material.

20:53.458 --> 20:54.924
That's amazing.

20:54.959 --> 20:56.585
Jonesy collects, too.

20:56.627 --> 20:57.752
Well, just a little.

20:57.794 --> 21:00.556
Of course, l did pick up the log
of Captain Edward Teach

21:00.596 --> 21:01.755
at the auction.

21:01.797 --> 21:03.696
-Blackbeard's log?
-Mm-hmm.

21:03.731 --> 21:05.197
That must have cost you
a small fortune.

21:05.232 --> 21:07.062
Use it or lose it.

21:07.100 --> 21:08.726
Like my daddy used to say,

21:08.768 --> 21:11.394
''You never see a Brinks truck
following a funeral.''

21:11.436 --> 21:13.164
Daddy.

21:13.203 --> 21:14.829
Oh, great.

21:14.871 --> 21:17.463
Here we go.

21:17.506 --> 21:19.200
Gracias, mi amiga.

21:19.241 --> 21:20.832
Thank you, Jonesy.

21:20.875 --> 21:24.309
Here you go, Karl.

21:24.344 --> 21:28.802
Um... Listen, Karl,
why don't you come on the yacht

21:28.846 --> 21:30.642
and go fishing with us?

21:30.681 --> 21:32.841
l can show you
where your namesake

21:32.882 --> 21:34.849
broadsided his first ship.

21:34.883 --> 21:36.679
We're going
out tomorrow.

21:36.718 --> 21:39.241
Please.
You have to come with us.

21:39.286 --> 21:40.912
That would be great.

21:40.953 --> 21:42.317
Excuse me, Karl.

21:42.355 --> 21:43.685
We should get our
table for dinner.

21:43.722 --> 21:45.712
No. Marcos,
another chair, please.

21:45.756 --> 21:47.780
Kitty, honey, l want
you to meet Val

21:47.824 --> 21:49.085
-and Jay.
-Hi.

21:49.125 --> 21:51.115
We may be going fishing
with them tomorrow.

21:51.160 --> 21:52.285
Really?

21:52.328 --> 21:53.851
Hi.

21:56.163 --> 21:57.754
Sorry.

21:57.797 --> 21:58.785
This is very nice.

21:58.831 --> 22:00.354
-Have a seat.
-Please.

22:37.521 --> 22:39.454
Erica.

22:39.489 --> 22:40.546
-Dylan.
-Don't look at me.

22:40.589 --> 22:41.782
Don't talk to me; just keep

22:41.824 --> 22:42.812
looking at the bottles

22:42.857 --> 22:43.948
and pretend like
you're shopping.

22:44.025 --> 22:45.719
Nobody can know
that l'm here, okay.

22:45.759 --> 22:47.157
Do you understand that?

22:47.194 --> 22:48.353
Uh-huh.

22:48.394 --> 22:50.623
Dylan, l missed you so much.

22:50.662 --> 22:51.958
l've missed you, too, kid.

22:51.996 --> 22:54.293
l can't believe how
much you've grown

22:54.331 --> 22:55.319
and how pretty you are.

22:55.365 --> 22:57.559
So l wasn't pretty before?

22:57.600 --> 23:00.465
You've always been pretty.

23:00.501 --> 23:02.434
Take me with you, Dylan.

23:02.470 --> 23:03.629
l hate it here.

23:05.038 --> 23:06.470
Erica! Have you decided?

23:06.505 --> 23:08.267
No.

23:08.306 --> 23:10.000
Well, hurry. We must get
back to the butcher's.

23:12.209 --> 23:13.971
You better go.

23:15.010 --> 23:17.068
Will you come back to get me?

23:17.112 --> 23:18.544
l promise.

23:18.579 --> 23:20.671
Here.

23:20.713 --> 23:22.703
l collect sea glass.

23:22.749 --> 23:24.909
lt's my favorite one.

23:45.995 --> 23:47.928
Why didn't you just walk
up to the front door,

23:47.996 --> 23:49.155
ring the bell
and announce yourself?

23:49.197 --> 23:50.561
'Cause l'm not
stupid, all right?

23:50.598 --> 23:51.928
Look, l was watching Erica.

23:51.966 --> 23:54.456
She left the Villa and went
into town-- nobody saw me.

23:54.501 --> 23:56.525
Now you're lying. You said
the guard looked at you.

23:56.568 --> 23:58.125
Oh, yeah, but he
didn't recognize me!

23:58.169 --> 24:00.193
Come on! Look, the kid's
not gonna say a word.

24:00.238 --> 24:01.204
Nothing has changed.

24:01.238 --> 24:02.727
Just stick to
your own plan.

24:02.773 --> 24:03.864
lt's working, isn't it?

24:03.973 --> 24:05.064
Well, no thanks to you.

24:05.107 --> 24:07.074
But come tomorrow,
when l sink the hook in...

24:07.108 --> 24:10.007
they'll be accessing
the big bucks in no time.

24:10.043 --> 24:12.737
Well, l tell you what--
not a minute too soon

24:12.779 --> 24:14.871
'cause the sooner you're
out of my life, the better.

24:14.913 --> 24:16.743
Oh, well, there's
gratitude for you, isn't it?

24:16.781 --> 24:18.680
Gratitude! You want
to talk gratitude?!

24:18.715 --> 24:20.113
Yeah, l want to talk
about gratitude!

24:20.150 --> 24:22.878
All right,
when you deliver...!

24:22.918 --> 24:25.885
Well, at least you've
got fine taste in women.

24:25.952 --> 24:29.442
Val had Kevin on a
string all night.

24:29.488 --> 24:31.546
Why, thank you, Jonesy.

24:31.589 --> 24:33.647
l thought l was
quite convincing myself.

24:34.958 --> 24:36.754
You know, l've
been thinking,

24:36.793 --> 24:38.760
we haven't discussed the,
uh, sleeping arrangements.

24:38.794 --> 24:42.819
So, l've got this king-size
bed in my master suite...

24:42.863 --> 24:44.887
Yeah, well, try not
to get too lonely in it,

24:44.931 --> 24:46.989
cause she's gonna sleep in here
in the servants' quarters.

24:47.032 --> 24:48.896
Well, no harm in
asking, is there?

24:48.933 --> 24:51.127
All right, Val, you
get some sleep tonight.

24:51.168 --> 24:52.566
We're gonna be
heading for the dock

24:52.602 --> 24:53.693
real early in the morning.

24:53.736 --> 24:54.702
l'll be ready.

24:54.737 --> 24:56.829
Good. Now, um...

24:56.871 --> 24:58.701
While you're at it tonight,

24:58.739 --> 25:01.570
try and find some
good places on her

25:01.607 --> 25:03.631
so l can, uh, stick
the transmitter.

25:03.675 --> 25:05.301
Yeah, l thought you were gonna

25:05.343 --> 25:06.934
-use the flower in her hat.
-l am.

25:06.977 --> 25:10.536
Geez. You've got
no sense of humor.

25:17.551 --> 25:18.847
You all right?

25:18.884 --> 25:21.044
Yeah.

25:21.085 --> 25:23.518
Are you all right?

25:23.554 --> 25:27.181
Well, it's not your
typical semester break.

25:27.223 --> 25:28.655
You okay with everything
he has planned

25:28.690 --> 25:30.657
for you and Kevin tomorrow?

25:30.692 --> 25:35.854
Well, Kevin makes my skin crawl,

25:35.894 --> 25:37.724
but l want to do this for you.

25:37.763 --> 25:42.198
You've been incredible, Val.

25:42.232 --> 25:44.426
ls there anything
l can do for you?

25:46.234 --> 25:48.497
Just hold me.

25:59.909 --> 26:00.897
Brandon.

26:03.178 --> 26:05.008
He said he'd see you now.

26:05.046 --> 26:06.137
You obviously
have some clout.

26:06.179 --> 26:07.372
No. You do.

26:09.715 --> 26:10.703
Thanks for squeezing me in.

26:10.749 --> 26:12.340
l'm sorry you had
to wait at all.

26:12.383 --> 26:14.350
lt's just, my students
always come first.

26:14.384 --> 26:16.146
Nothing wrong with that.

26:16.185 --> 26:17.811
But l figure the
student president

26:17.854 --> 26:19.115
does deserve a few perks.

26:19.154 --> 26:21.677
A cappuccino bar in the
hallway would be nice.

26:23.023 --> 26:25.183
No wonder Kelly has such
nice things to say about you.

26:25.225 --> 26:26.282
The feeling is mutual.

26:26.325 --> 26:27.484
Good.

26:27.526 --> 26:31.483
Then let's fast-forward
this, shall we?

26:31.528 --> 26:34.086
l'm looking to you, Brandon,
to be a torch-bearer.

26:34.129 --> 26:36.255
lt's obvious l'm going to
have to mobilize this campus

26:36.297 --> 26:37.490
to get what l deserve.

26:37.532 --> 26:40.158
l understand.
l actually have a few ideas

26:40.200 --> 26:42.224
about how to re-approach
the Faculty Council.

26:42.268 --> 26:44.633
l was speaking
with Dean Whitmore,

26:44.669 --> 26:46.329
and l think there
may be some credence

26:46.370 --> 26:47.927
in directly answering
your critics.

26:47.972 --> 26:51.337
What are you talking about?

26:51.373 --> 26:53.033
Did Whitmore bring up

26:53.075 --> 26:55.304
those stupid, malicious
retreat allegations?

26:55.343 --> 26:57.708
No.

26:57.744 --> 27:00.177
l was talking
about your lack

27:00.212 --> 27:02.974
of publishing
in academic journals.

27:03.014 --> 27:04.310
You're lying.

27:04.348 --> 27:07.213
He's already poisoned
your mind against me.

27:07.250 --> 27:11.412
Did he describe my teachings
as ''messianic''? Did he?

27:11.452 --> 27:12.782
Yeah. So what?

27:12.820 --> 27:13.877
So what's next?!

27:13.920 --> 27:15.784
My classes are
described as cults?

27:15.822 --> 27:18.119
l'm crucified as a heretic?

27:18.156 --> 27:21.123
You all make me sick!

27:21.158 --> 27:23.989
Professor Finley, l came
here today as an ally.

27:24.026 --> 27:26.425
No, no, no, no! You came here
on a fact-finding mission

27:26.461 --> 27:27.791
to see if l'm as dangerous

27:27.829 --> 27:29.318
as Chancellor Arnold
and all the others

27:29.363 --> 27:30.795
would like to think.

27:30.831 --> 27:33.321
Well, l'll tell you
something: l'm worse,

27:33.366 --> 27:35.265
and if they want
a showdown with me,

27:35.300 --> 27:37.767
l will bring this campus
to its knees.

27:52.977 --> 27:55.467
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

27:55.512 --> 27:58.479
Whoa!

28:00.382 --> 28:02.713
Hey! Be careful
with that marlin!

28:02.750 --> 28:04.614
lt took Karl all
morning to reel it in.

28:04.651 --> 28:07.118
At least, l didn't lose
my fish, like some people.

28:08.787 --> 28:09.753
Come to me.

28:09.787 --> 28:11.754
Come to me.

28:11.821 --> 28:14.754
Well, l think Jonesy
was a little too busy

28:14.790 --> 28:16.950
talking business today.

28:16.991 --> 28:18.753
More like plunder.

28:18.793 --> 28:20.089
Whatever business
you all are in,

28:20.127 --> 28:21.616
it sure seems like
a growth industry.

28:21.661 --> 28:24.355
l told you, l'm a taxidermist.

28:24.396 --> 28:25.760
Jonesy, would you spill it?

28:25.797 --> 28:26.763
They're cool.

28:26.797 --> 28:27.763
ln due time.

28:27.798 --> 28:29.287
Listen, Captain Karl.

28:29.332 --> 28:30.628
Let's get a picture of this.

28:30.667 --> 28:32.258
Nobody else is
gonna believe it.

28:32.301 --> 28:33.961
String it up, boys.

28:34.002 --> 28:35.593
l think that's
enough fish stories.

28:37.370 --> 28:38.836
We need to talk.

28:39.939 --> 28:42.065
Really?

28:42.106 --> 28:43.595
Really.

28:43.641 --> 28:45.130
Thank you.

28:46.809 --> 28:47.866
So?

28:49.811 --> 28:51.107
Well, l think Jonesy found

28:51.146 --> 28:53.079
-a new fishing partner.
-Hmm.

28:53.113 --> 28:56.308
Next time, l may send may
daughter instead of me.

28:56.349 --> 28:58.714
Erica will appreciate it more.

28:58.750 --> 29:01.115
Wow. You and Karl
have a daughter.

29:01.152 --> 29:02.209
That's wild.

29:02.252 --> 29:03.582
Who does she look like more?

29:03.620 --> 29:04.677
Well, not Karl.

29:04.720 --> 29:05.686
lt's another father.

29:05.721 --> 29:09.382
And she's adorable.

29:09.423 --> 29:12.015
She has the best
qualities of each of us.

29:12.058 --> 29:15.048
Wow. lt sounds like you
still like this guy.

29:15.093 --> 29:17.583
l guess l always will.

29:17.628 --> 29:19.219
Unfortunately, Jack died

29:19.262 --> 29:21.593
a few years ago.

29:21.631 --> 29:22.927
l'm sorry.

29:22.965 --> 29:24.363
Come on everybody,
let's get in.

29:24.398 --> 29:26.592
Picture time. Photo-op.

29:26.634 --> 29:27.725
All right.

29:29.568 --> 29:30.727
Okay.  Sonriendo?

29:30.769 --> 29:32.497
Fish!

29:32.537 --> 29:34.936
He is a smuggler.

29:34.972 --> 29:36.268
He just told me.

29:36.306 --> 29:38.637
He uses stuffed trophy
fish like this as a cover.

29:38.674 --> 29:40.641
And why would he
tell you that?

29:40.675 --> 29:43.403
One pirate to another.

29:43.444 --> 29:45.967
He's looking for
a money partner to expand.

29:49.981 --> 29:50.947
Sorry about that.

29:50.982 --> 29:52.005
So, uh,

29:52.048 --> 29:53.014
where were we?

29:53.049 --> 29:54.276
Just making dinner
reservations.

29:54.317 --> 29:56.045
Only this time, it's
gonna be our treat.

29:56.085 --> 29:57.210
-Oh, great.
-We want to learn

29:57.251 --> 29:58.478
a little more
about taxidermy.

29:58.519 --> 30:00.383
Well, you work it
out; l have to get

30:00.420 --> 30:01.443
to the hotel health club.

30:01.488 --> 30:02.886
For what they charge
for a massage,

30:02.922 --> 30:04.115
l don't want to be late.

30:04.156 --> 30:05.747
Oh. Sorry, Karl. Wait,
wait one second.

30:05.790 --> 30:07.086
Uh, l'm gonna go with her

30:07.124 --> 30:09.614
and make sure Marco
gives her the VlP discount

30:09.659 --> 30:11.751
or else he's gonna lose
me as a friend. Okay?

30:11.794 --> 30:12.953
Well, thank you.

30:12.995 --> 30:15.928
l'll, uh, see you later.

30:15.963 --> 30:20.295
So, l guess it's,
uh... just us.

30:20.332 --> 30:21.628
Yeah.

30:21.667 --> 30:23.133
Little ol' us.

30:25.002 --> 30:26.764
You know, l can't
believe your house

30:26.803 --> 30:29.429
is just right up
the beach.

30:29.472 --> 30:31.098
Your place must be fabulous.

30:31.139 --> 30:35.767
Yeah, it's kind of a
dream house, really.

30:35.808 --> 30:37.638
Would you like to see it?

30:37.676 --> 30:39.142
l'd love to.

30:43.513 --> 30:45.377
l love the painting.

30:45.414 --> 30:46.778
That's Anne Bonney,

30:46.815 --> 30:49.441
swashbuckling queen
of the seas,

30:49.484 --> 30:55.078
''as dangerous with her sword
as she was with her body.''

30:55.120 --> 30:58.246
Sounds like a role model
for our generation.

30:58.288 --> 31:00.255
And let me guess.

31:00.289 --> 31:03.154
Behind the painting is ye
olde wall safe, right?

31:03.191 --> 31:05.590
No. That's not my style.

31:05.626 --> 31:09.651
l like the four firm walls
of a bank around my fortune.

31:09.695 --> 31:12.594
Well, not Jonesy and l.

31:12.630 --> 31:16.064
Too many clerks
knowing your business.

31:16.099 --> 31:18.589
You're just doing the
wrong kind of banking.

31:18.634 --> 31:20.601
l like to think of myself

31:20.635 --> 31:22.966
as being on the cutting
edge of cyber-finance.

31:23.003 --> 31:25.163
l think you've lost me.

31:25.204 --> 31:28.399
l don't mean to brag, but l
could be sitting right here,

31:28.440 --> 31:29.736
in the middle of paradise

31:29.840 --> 31:32.739
doing all my banking

31:32.776 --> 31:34.606
while enjoying a drink

31:34.644 --> 31:36.838
and the company
of an irresistible woman.

31:38.446 --> 31:39.742
You can?

31:39.781 --> 31:42.078
Just by using a computer?

31:42.115 --> 31:44.673
Along with a private
modem phone line.

31:44.717 --> 31:45.876
For example, you and Jonesy

31:45.917 --> 31:47.178
are looking
for a partner, right?

31:47.218 --> 31:49.741
Maybe l need some extra cash
to prove that l'm serious.

31:49.787 --> 31:50.753
l might just...

31:50.853 --> 31:53.320
call up my account.

31:53.355 --> 31:55.288
Where's your bank?

31:55.322 --> 31:56.754
ln the Cayman lslands.

31:56.791 --> 31:59.417
This will just...

31:59.459 --> 32:00.789
take a second.

32:03.061 --> 32:04.357
Yes. Yes!

32:04.395 --> 32:05.361
You got the bank?

32:05.395 --> 32:06.361
l got the bank.

32:06.396 --> 32:07.692
l got the bank account.

32:07.730 --> 32:11.687
And l'm now zeroing in...
on his password.

32:11.733 --> 32:13.700
Jones, you're a
hell of a computer geek.

32:13.734 --> 32:15.496
Wrong, wrong.
This isn't

32:15.535 --> 32:17.092
a computer, man.

32:17.136 --> 32:19.864
To me, this is video games, man.

32:19.905 --> 32:22.701
This is, this is Pong,
man, this is Pac-Man,

32:22.739 --> 32:24.638
this is Rebel Assault, man.

32:24.674 --> 32:27.334
l'm just trying to beat
the machine, run up the score.

32:27.376 --> 32:29.570
Okay, run up eight million.

32:29.610 --> 32:30.576
Piece of cake--

32:30.610 --> 32:32.839
thanks to our gal, Val.

32:32.878 --> 32:34.367
How's she handling him?

32:34.413 --> 32:35.811
She's gotta be out
of there already.

32:35.847 --> 32:37.006
Erica knocked on
the bedroom door

32:37.048 --> 32:38.708
and he had to send
her out the back.

32:38.816 --> 32:40.373
She's probably coming up
the beach right now.

32:40.416 --> 32:41.382
lt's all up to you.

32:41.417 --> 32:42.383
Oh, damn it.

32:42.418 --> 32:43.384
What?

32:43.418 --> 32:44.611
Damn, damn. Oh!

32:44.653 --> 32:48.280
What! Don't tell me
you lost it?! Come on!

32:49.422 --> 32:51.855
Blink check.

32:51.890 --> 32:53.720
Got you in a
blink, didn't l?

32:53.758 --> 32:55.122
Stop messing around.

32:55.158 --> 32:57.716
Come on! That's eight
million bucks!

32:57.760 --> 32:59.727
Well, smile, partner.

32:59.762 --> 33:01.524
The joke is
on Captain Karl.

33:01.563 --> 33:02.995
Right now,
at this very moment,

33:03.030 --> 33:04.587
there's seven and a half
million dollars

33:04.631 --> 33:06.393
in an FBl account

33:06.432 --> 33:08.797
with our names
attached to it-- in bold.

33:08.834 --> 33:09.993
What do you mean?

33:10.035 --> 33:11.365
Are you telling me you made
that transfer?

33:11.402 --> 33:13.028
My grubby little
hands did it.

33:13.069 --> 33:15.002
No, no, no applause.
No applause yet.

33:15.038 --> 33:17.528
Listen, l want to be
packed up and ready to go

33:17.573 --> 33:19.335
when Valerie walks
in, all right?

33:19.373 --> 33:21.670
l want to make that 3:00 flight.

33:21.742 --> 33:24.402
What about Erica?

33:24.443 --> 33:26.069
What about her?

33:26.111 --> 33:27.975
She's my sister.

33:28.011 --> 33:30.069
l can't leave her down here.

33:30.114 --> 33:32.206
Mission accomplished,
Ace, all right?

33:32.248 --> 33:33.339
Dash for the cash.

33:33.381 --> 33:35.314
We're not going
anywhere without her.

33:35.349 --> 33:37.872
What's this ''we'' thing, huh?

33:37.917 --> 33:41.681
Now, our deal strictly called
for us to go after the dough.

33:41.720 --> 33:43.778
l got no plan on
how to snatch a kid.

33:43.821 --> 33:45.151
Well, you're
the big professional.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.485
lt shouldn't be
too difficult for you.

33:46.523 --> 33:47.989
You know what, let me
tell you something.

33:48.023 --> 33:50.047
ln my business, okay,
worse thing you can do

33:50.092 --> 33:51.956
is listen to somebody like
you, and that's an amateur,

33:51.993 --> 33:53.084
because you get dead.

33:53.127 --> 33:55.685
All right? lt's over,
spud boy, the game's over.

33:55.762 --> 33:57.456
Hey, it's not over
for me, okay?

33:57.497 --> 34:01.454
All right, pay attention, okay.

34:01.499 --> 34:03.466
l'm not staying.

34:16.875 --> 34:19.239
l can't believe you
let him leave, Dylan!

34:19.275 --> 34:20.833
Look, would you just
forget about it?

34:20.877 --> 34:22.571
l mean, he's a mercenary.
l don't need that.

34:22.612 --> 34:23.635
This is crazy.

34:23.712 --> 34:25.042
You've got no plan.

34:25.080 --> 34:26.409
l've got a pretty
good idea though.

34:26.447 --> 34:27.811
l think we can pull it off.

34:27.848 --> 34:29.246
Well, it better be quick,

34:29.282 --> 34:30.475
because the Cavendishes
are coming over

34:30.516 --> 34:32.141
to pick me and Jonesy
up for dinner.

34:32.184 --> 34:33.650
Exactly, and that's
all the time l need

34:33.684 --> 34:36.117
to get Erica out of that house,
but you've got to help me.

34:36.152 --> 34:38.449
And what makes you think
you can get into that house?

34:42.824 --> 34:44.949
Yeah, it's like a phone tree.

34:44.992 --> 34:47.118
That way, we'll all be ready
when Finley needs us.

34:47.159 --> 34:49.525
Lee, can l call you back?

34:49.561 --> 34:51.652
Yeah, l'm thrilled
about it, too.

34:51.695 --> 34:52.786
Bye.

34:52.830 --> 34:54.194
Thrilled about what?

34:54.230 --> 34:56.458
Finley hired me on
as his research assistant.

34:56.498 --> 34:57.964
Great.

34:58.000 --> 34:59.967
l consider it a miracle after
the meeting you had with him.

35:00.001 --> 35:01.729
You heard about
that already, huh?

35:01.768 --> 35:02.859
Everybody has.

35:02.903 --> 35:04.130
What were you thinking?

35:04.170 --> 35:05.193
What was l thinking?

35:05.237 --> 35:06.533
Kelly, l got ambushed.

35:06.571 --> 35:08.697
As soon as he heard that l
had talked to Dean Whitmore,

35:08.739 --> 35:10.000
the guy went crazy.

35:10.040 --> 35:11.097
Why would he do that?

35:11.140 --> 35:12.197
Because he's paranoid.

35:12.241 --> 35:13.264
l would be, too.

35:13.308 --> 35:15.275
You all stabbed him
in the back.

35:15.310 --> 35:17.300
Wait a minute, now
l'm a member of ''you all''?

35:17.344 --> 35:19.709
Brandon, you are as much
a part of the C.U. establishment

35:19.746 --> 35:20.803
as any other extern.

35:20.846 --> 35:24.780
''Extern,''
what is that, Finley-speak?

35:24.816 --> 35:27.749
Yeah, it's his word for people
who don't have a clue.

35:27.784 --> 35:29.978
Now if you'll excuse me,
l have some phone calls to make.

35:30.019 --> 35:31.349
Hold on a second.

35:31.386 --> 35:33.546
You're the one that wanted
me to talk to the dean

35:33.587 --> 35:35.019
in the first place.

35:35.055 --> 35:36.715
You've gotta start taking
some responsibility here.

35:36.756 --> 35:37.881
Brandon, l am taking
responsibility.

35:37.924 --> 35:39.754
For the first time
since the fire,

35:39.791 --> 35:43.555
thanks to Finley, l am feeling
strong and clear and unafraid.

35:43.593 --> 35:44.854
You just don't get it.

35:44.894 --> 35:48.384
You're right, l don't get it.

36:05.173 --> 36:07.765
Erica, if that's
the best plie

36:07.808 --> 36:09.707
you can do, l'm not
going to waste money

36:09.742 --> 36:11.333
on any more lessons for you.

36:11.376 --> 36:12.569
l don't want any lessons!

36:12.644 --> 36:14.577
l don't want anything from you.

36:14.679 --> 36:18.113
So, do l look all right?

36:18.148 --> 36:20.581
Just who are you trying
to look all right for?

36:20.616 --> 36:22.412
Sweetheart, why
don't you try

36:22.450 --> 36:24.610
lightening up for
a change, all right?

36:28.920 --> 36:31.251
You have a visitor at the door.
A Val Jones.

36:31.288 --> 36:33.255
Send her in.

36:33.290 --> 36:34.551
What's she doing here?

36:34.591 --> 36:36.854
l have no idea.

36:40.628 --> 36:43.118
You guys are going to think
l'm such an airhead.

36:43.163 --> 36:44.254
Why? What happened?

36:44.296 --> 36:45.319
Well, l went beachcombing

36:45.364 --> 36:47.126
and lost track of time,

36:47.165 --> 36:48.426
and l saw your place.

36:48.466 --> 36:49.454
Well, that's no problem.

36:49.499 --> 36:50.795
We were going
to pick you up anyway.

36:50.834 --> 36:52.323
You're a beachcomber?

36:52.368 --> 36:54.301
Yeah, and Jonesy hates it.

36:54.336 --> 36:56.599
He doesn't understand how
anyone can spend so much time

36:56.704 --> 36:58.796
looking for sea glass.

36:58.838 --> 37:03.136
Oh. Well, l understand
the obsession.

37:03.175 --> 37:04.664
Erica collects it, too.

37:04.709 --> 37:06.198
Well, she can have mine.

37:06.243 --> 37:08.233
l can?

37:08.278 --> 37:09.642
Of course.

37:09.678 --> 37:12.201
Hi, l'm Val.

37:12.247 --> 37:14.180
Hi.

37:14.214 --> 37:16.147
Well, while you two
discuss hobby hints,

37:16.182 --> 37:18.842
we'll get our things
so we can be off.

37:18.884 --> 37:20.111
Good. l'm starving.

37:20.151 --> 37:21.947
Did you find
any good pieces?

37:21.986 --> 37:24.544
Yes, actually, l did.

37:24.621 --> 37:26.383
A beautiful blue one.

37:31.192 --> 37:32.283
Val...

37:32.325 --> 37:34.848
do you want to call Jonesy,
let him know where you are?

37:34.894 --> 37:36.952
No. l'll just
run up and change.

37:36.995 --> 37:39.155
He's a lot better
to deal with in person.

37:40.664 --> 37:43.961
You listen to Ana
and Felipe, okay?

37:43.999 --> 37:45.829
They have a nice
dinner for you.

37:45.867 --> 37:48.027
Yes, Mom.

37:48.068 --> 37:49.034
Good night.

37:49.068 --> 37:50.659
Good night, sweetie.

38:42.401 --> 38:43.424
Hola?

38:43.468 --> 38:44.900
Ana, this is Mrs. Cavendish.

38:44.936 --> 38:46.129
l want Erica

38:46.170 --> 38:47.932
to take a shower before dinner.

38:47.971 --> 38:49.528
A shower for Erica.

38:49.605 --> 38:51.538
Sure, l will call Felipe
right away

38:51.572 --> 38:52.799
so he can get it started.

38:52.840 --> 38:53.828
l don't want to take a shower!

38:53.875 --> 38:55.967
Put Erica on the phone please.

38:58.945 --> 39:00.536
Dylan, watch out!

39:00.645 --> 39:01.702
Dylan?!

39:01.745 --> 39:03.041
What's going on
in there?

39:03.080 --> 39:04.706
Ana? Felipe?

39:04.747 --> 39:06.043
Stop the car.

39:07.482 --> 39:10.040
Uh, what's the problem?

39:10.084 --> 39:11.448
There was an intruder, senora.

39:11.485 --> 39:13.577
A gringo but Felipe
has captured him.

39:13.620 --> 39:15.018
Good. Lock Erica in her room.

39:15.054 --> 39:16.543
We're coming right back.

39:19.090 --> 39:21.114
What the hell
are you doing?

39:21.158 --> 39:24.683
l thought l'd ask darling Val
about the Dylan in our house.

39:24.726 --> 39:28.751
Dylan? l don't know any Dylan.

39:32.898 --> 39:36.024
Ana, you can go.

39:36.067 --> 39:38.330
Felipe, thank you.

39:40.336 --> 39:42.701
Dylan McKay.

39:42.737 --> 39:44.328
Long time no see.

39:44.371 --> 39:46.497
Well, now we can stop
looking over our shoulders.

39:46.606 --> 39:48.402
l knew you'd eventually
pay us a visit.

39:48.441 --> 39:50.169
Hell, l would have
been here sooner,

39:50.208 --> 39:52.072
But you guys, you didn't
leave a forwarding address.

39:52.109 --> 39:53.234
You...

39:53.277 --> 39:54.937
sit down.

39:57.179 --> 39:59.169
Who's the girl?

39:59.214 --> 40:01.238
Nice try.

40:01.282 --> 40:02.805
But she has a surprisingly low

40:02.849 --> 40:04.509
threshold for pain.

40:04.550 --> 40:05.641
l'm sorry, Dylan.

40:05.684 --> 40:07.446
All right, you guys
have had your fun.

40:07.485 --> 40:09.247
What do you say we make a deal?

40:09.287 --> 40:10.651
A deal?

40:10.687 --> 40:12.881
l don't think you have
any money to make a deal.

40:12.922 --> 40:15.048
And l don't think you want
to spend the rest of your life

40:15.090 --> 40:16.386
running from the law, do you?

40:16.424 --> 40:19.152
Yo, ho, hee,
the pirate life for me.

40:19.193 --> 40:20.853
What are you guys
going to do to us?

40:20.893 --> 40:22.257
That depends on
how you behave.

40:22.294 --> 40:23.624
But l can tell you this.

40:23.662 --> 40:25.322
People have disappeared
in Punta Brava.

40:25.363 --> 40:27.057
Even beautiful women.

40:27.097 --> 40:28.654
We have to get
something straight.

40:28.698 --> 40:31.460
Valerie said that Jonesy
left Punta Brava.

40:31.500 --> 40:32.989
Where did he go, Dylan?

40:36.969 --> 40:38.595
He's right outside.

40:41.206 --> 40:42.638
Now, don't get cute.

40:42.673 --> 40:45.004
Dylan, just tell
them the truth.

40:45.041 --> 40:46.439
That is the truth.

40:58.383 --> 41:01.009
Stay down, l got him!

41:01.051 --> 41:02.608
He's mine.

41:05.120 --> 41:06.677
Oh, you're dead, McKay.

41:16.027 --> 41:18.585
Stop it, man! Stop it!

41:21.530 --> 41:23.394
That's not bad, kid.

41:25.365 --> 41:26.763
Okay, let me go.

41:26.800 --> 41:28.596
l'll cut you in on the money.

41:28.634 --> 41:30.157
lt's in a Cayman lsland bank.

41:30.201 --> 41:33.532
Honey, your horny husband lost
all that money this afternoon.

41:36.005 --> 41:38.370
Good.

41:38.407 --> 41:39.998
What the hell
took you so long?

41:42.709 --> 41:45.176
Geez, what a day.

41:54.717 --> 41:56.513
So, what made you
change your mind?

41:56.584 --> 41:57.982
Well, l started thinking, uh,

41:58.018 --> 42:00.417
how royally you were going
to screw everything up,

42:00.453 --> 42:02.079
so l called my pal the federale

42:02.121 --> 42:04.588
to see if he'd roll
in the troops.

42:04.623 --> 42:06.886
Jonesy, what a
good friend you are.

42:06.924 --> 42:09.414
Of course, it helped
that l told a little lie.

42:09.459 --> 42:11.926
Well, how little?

42:11.960 --> 42:14.052
l told him that
the Cavendishes

42:14.095 --> 42:17.119
were plotting
to kidnap Erik Estrada.

42:17.164 --> 42:19.358
Now, don't laugh,
don't laugh.

42:19.398 --> 42:21.627
He's a big star down here.

42:21.666 --> 42:24.133
Anyhow, everything's gonna be
all sorted out in the morning.

42:24.168 --> 42:27.226
The FBl is gonna ask
for extradition

42:27.270 --> 42:29.134
on the fraud charges.

42:29.171 --> 42:30.967
And me, myself,

42:31.005 --> 42:33.131
l am going to take
my federale pal

42:33.173 --> 42:36.163
on a vacation to Las Vegas.

42:36.208 --> 42:37.936
Hey, that comes out of your end.

42:37.975 --> 42:39.771
But still, l mean,
you didn't have

42:39.811 --> 42:41.937
to come yourself.

42:41.978 --> 42:44.411
How was l to enjoy the spoils

42:44.447 --> 42:46.471
if anything happened
to you, hmm?

42:46.548 --> 42:50.209
Well, all l can say is

42:50.249 --> 42:52.443
your timing was impeccable.

42:52.485 --> 42:56.168
A long, slow kiss would
be thank you enough.

42:56.213 --> 42:58.268
And a grab and a tickle, too.

42:58.304 --> 43:01.119
Assuming McKay didn't mind...

43:01.161 --> 43:03.240
McKay?

43:07.887 --> 43:10.108
l thought they would kill you.
