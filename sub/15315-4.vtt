WEBVTT

00:02.000 --> 00:03.520
Good news, Scrope?

00:04.415 --> 00:06.015
Give me good news.

00:06.055 --> 00:10.575
Erm...yes, well, with
the, uh...money you get

00:10.615 --> 00:15.775
from selling the winter
food stores to the merchants,

00:15.815 --> 00:19.815
you'll be back in profit by...

00:27.855 --> 00:29.935
..six pence ha'penny.

00:33.935 --> 00:37.935
Is this some kind of joke? Oh,
I forgot, you don't do jokes.

00:37.975 --> 00:39.815
I'm not very good at them.

00:39.855 --> 00:43.055
PATHETIC! I WANT MONEY!

00:43.095 --> 00:46.415
Prince John will not
wait for his patronage!

00:48.615 --> 00:51.415
I must have a thousand
crowns or I'm finished.

00:52.735 --> 00:56.415
And where is Gisborne when I need
him? Gallivanting with Prince John?

00:56.455 --> 00:58.135
Scheming against me?

00:59.695 --> 01:02.055
The new tax collector comes today.

01:02.095 --> 01:05.655
They say he's very
good. Ruthless Rufus.

01:06.695 --> 01:07.815
Well...

01:08.455 --> 01:09.895
he better live up to his name

01:09.935 --> 01:12.055
because...

01:12.095 --> 01:13.735
I WANT MONEY!

01:15.000 --> 01:21.074

01:23.935 --> 01:27.855
So, we're going to steal the
Sheriff's winter food store?

01:30.255 --> 01:31.655
To feed the poor...

01:31.695 --> 01:36.215
from those wagons guarded
by all those soldiers.

01:37.775 --> 01:39.295
How, exactly?

01:39.335 --> 01:42.895
By making that wagon disappear.

01:54.055 --> 01:56.335
Home sweet home.

01:58.135 --> 01:59.935
So what do you think?

01:59.975 --> 02:03.135
Are you ready and willing to
help me on this one?Yes, Father.

02:06.095 --> 02:07.975
Excuse me, a jug of ale, please.

02:28.375 --> 02:29.375
Urgh!

02:29.415 --> 02:31.015
Urgh!

02:31.055 --> 02:34.815
Help! Ooh! Argh!

02:50.335 --> 02:52.375
Watch, come on! Faster!

02:52.415 --> 02:54.255
Not bad!

02:54.295 --> 02:55.855
Thank you.

02:55.895 --> 02:57.415
Lift!

03:09.695 --> 03:11.415
Halt!

03:15.975 --> 03:17.615
Let him through.

03:27.295 --> 03:31.775
What do you mean, the
wagon's disappeared?!

03:33.095 --> 03:35.975
Wagons and horses
do not just vanish!

03:37.575 --> 03:39.095
Looks like you got played!

03:39.135 --> 03:43.215
And I thought YOU, the
Sheriff of Nottingham,

03:43.255 --> 03:45.255
would be untouchable by now.

03:46.535 --> 03:47.655
Ooh!

03:47.695 --> 03:51.215
Do I know you?My name's Rufus.

03:51.255 --> 03:53.375
Your new tax collector.

03:53.415 --> 03:56.735
Back in my home town,

03:56.775 --> 03:59.055
and this time...

03:59.095 --> 04:01.135
I've come to make Nottingham pay.

04:53.735 --> 04:55.375
All right, everybody! Listen up!

04:55.415 --> 04:58.735
And listen well.

04:58.775 --> 05:01.015
You don't know me,

05:01.055 --> 05:03.415
you don't know what I'm like,

05:03.455 --> 05:06.455
so I'm going to give
you a little example

05:06.495 --> 05:09.415
of the kind of tax collector I am.

05:09.455 --> 05:12.575
And what happens
if you don't pay up.

05:12.615 --> 05:14.695
We pay our taxes, we
don't need his example.

05:16.255 --> 05:18.615
I think I'm gonna be
the one who decides that.

05:21.375 --> 05:22.815
This yours?

05:23.895 --> 05:24.975
Yes.

05:25.015 --> 05:27.335
It's our livelihood.

05:27.375 --> 05:29.175
Remember it fondly.

05:29.215 --> 05:31.255
Edmund!

05:31.295 --> 05:33.175
Let her go!I can't. Sorry.

05:33.215 --> 05:34.975
Don't apologise, Edmund.

05:35.015 --> 05:38.495
Don't apologise? You're just
hurting an innocent woman.

05:38.535 --> 05:40.975
Learn something I've learnt!

05:41.015 --> 05:44.855
If you're weak, hope is pointless!

05:44.895 --> 05:48.135
The world is hard
on the little people!

05:50.255 --> 05:52.815
You'd agree with that,
wouldn't you, Sheriff?

05:52.855 --> 05:55.455
The small exist to be stamped on.

05:55.495 --> 05:58.895
There is a pleasing logic
about what you say, yes.

05:58.935 --> 06:01.735
It'll take us months to put right!

06:01.775 --> 06:03.255
You don't say.

06:16.695 --> 06:19.215
No!

06:23.615 --> 06:24.615
Very good!

06:26.975 --> 06:30.655
You didn't need to do that! You
didn't have to destroy everything!

06:30.695 --> 06:33.175
Kate, stop it. You wanna
keep your mouth shut.

06:33.215 --> 06:35.215
No. I really don't.

06:38.335 --> 06:41.975
I tell you what I'm going
to do, just this once.

06:42.015 --> 06:44.375
I'll play nice.

06:44.415 --> 06:46.895
I won't make you suffer
for disrespecting me.

06:49.175 --> 06:50.775
I'll make her suffer instead.

06:55.775 --> 06:57.375
Do you want her to live?

06:59.935 --> 07:02.055
Yes.

07:02.095 --> 07:04.335
Then you come with
me to Locksley Manor.

07:04.375 --> 07:07.535
You make me smile.

07:07.575 --> 07:09.615
You do that,

07:09.655 --> 07:11.415
and I'll let your mother go.

07:13.255 --> 07:16.095
So what's it gonna be, little lady?

07:16.135 --> 07:18.975
Do we have a deal?

07:23.855 --> 07:24.895
Yes.

07:24.935 --> 07:28.775
Don't take her, please, she's
my daughter, take me instead.

07:28.815 --> 07:32.735
So, Sheriff, how was this show,
did you get a kick out of it?

07:32.775 --> 07:38.215
Very good. You make Gisborne
look all...warm and snuggly.

07:38.255 --> 07:40.215
Good.

07:40.255 --> 07:42.695
That's good.

07:45.375 --> 07:46.375
I like him.

07:49.575 --> 07:51.695
Did you see that man
watching us earlier?

07:51.735 --> 07:54.815
With the kid?There's
something familiar about him.

07:54.855 --> 07:56.415
It's like...I don't know...

07:56.455 --> 07:58.855
I saw smoke!

07:58.895 --> 08:00.615
I think Locksley's on fire!

08:05.215 --> 08:06.815
Nervous?

08:16.455 --> 08:18.975
I feel like some entertainment.

08:23.695 --> 08:25.175
Can you dance?

08:26.935 --> 08:30.775
Dancing is pretty basic, so yes,

08:30.815 --> 08:32.895
I think I can manage it.

08:32.934 --> 08:34.215
Good.

08:34.255 --> 08:36.054
Edmund?

08:36.095 --> 08:37.975
Sit...

08:38.015 --> 08:39.655
watch the girl dance.

08:40.934 --> 08:43.215
I have to see to the horses.

08:52.775 --> 08:54.375
Well, dance then.

09:02.095 --> 09:04.095
And smile.

09:07.095 --> 09:09.855
We need more water and buckets.

09:09.895 --> 09:14.295
John, who did this?It was the man
we saw this morning with his son.

09:14.335 --> 09:16.335
Robin, he's the new tax collector.

09:16.375 --> 09:18.215
Eh? Where's Gisborne?

09:21.175 --> 09:22.575
It's Kate! She needs our help!

09:36.295 --> 09:38.175
Well, I did what you wanted...

09:38.215 --> 09:39.975
so are we done now?

09:40.015 --> 09:41.455
Oh, no.

09:52.815 --> 09:54.255
No, no, no, no, no.

09:57.415 --> 09:59.135
We're not done yet.

10:00.215 --> 10:01.295
Are you sure about that?

10:02.615 --> 10:03.855
Robin!

10:03.895 --> 10:05.615
Robin Hood, I assume.

10:06.695 --> 10:09.135
We meet again. Lucky you.

10:10.455 --> 10:11.455
Much!

10:11.495 --> 10:13.135
What are you doing here?

10:13.175 --> 10:14.775
Saving a damsel in distress.

10:14.815 --> 10:17.135
I was doing fine on my own!

10:20.855 --> 10:22.575
You're wasting your time!

10:22.615 --> 10:24.375
Why do you help the weak, Robin?

10:25.415 --> 10:27.375
Haven't you worked it out yet?

10:27.415 --> 10:28.975
Charity is pointless.

10:29.015 --> 10:31.295
Helping the innocent
is never pointless.

10:36.415 --> 10:38.255
Hurt my son again, you'll suffer.

10:38.295 --> 10:42.175
Oh! Who's going to
make me suffer, you?!

10:42.215 --> 10:45.255
A man who bullies young girls?

10:45.295 --> 10:50.575
Now, you ask nicely, you say
"please" and I won't kill you.

10:50.615 --> 10:53.615
You see, my father was the
kind of man who asked nicely.

10:53.655 --> 10:56.615
And I watched him get
kicked around for it.

10:56.655 --> 11:01.375
So I don't ask nicely, and
I don't get kicked around.

11:01.415 --> 11:03.415
Kill me if you want,

11:03.455 --> 11:04.695
but I don't beg.

11:04.735 --> 11:07.455
The girl's coming with me.
-Take her.

11:07.495 --> 11:10.015
Her sweet face isn't
worth this much trouble.

11:11.935 --> 11:14.055
Oh, one other thing.

11:14.095 --> 11:17.775
I'll be telling my good friend the
Sheriff who your new friends are.

11:17.815 --> 11:21.495
So you'd better keep your
pretty face hidden from now on.

11:21.535 --> 11:24.615
You've just made it on to
Nottingham's Most Wanted list.

11:27.095 --> 11:28.575
Come on.

11:36.055 --> 11:38.455
Some knights in shining
armour you lot are,

11:38.495 --> 11:41.735
just swoop in and now
I have to leave home(!)

11:41.775 --> 11:44.415
You were in trouble,
we're only trying to help!

11:44.455 --> 11:46.055
Do I really have to do this?

11:46.095 --> 11:50.655
Kate, he will tell the Sheriff
and you'll be hunted. All right?

11:50.695 --> 11:52.895
It's time to say goodbye.

11:52.935 --> 11:55.055
About face!

11:56.615 --> 11:58.695
I hear that the Earl
of Northumberland

11:58.735 --> 12:02.135
is having problems on his
borders with raiding Scots.

12:03.215 --> 12:05.615
Northumberland, don't like him.

12:05.655 --> 12:08.135
Always so...jolly.

12:08.175 --> 12:11.895
No, the Celtic scum can have
his land as far as I'm concerned.

12:11.935 --> 12:15.015
He's offering gold for troops.

12:18.575 --> 12:21.695
Atten-tion!

12:21.735 --> 12:23.695
That would leave me unprotected.

12:23.735 --> 12:26.775
Oh, just for a few short weeks.

12:26.815 --> 12:29.495
You could close down the
castle until they return.

12:29.535 --> 12:33.215
Apparently, Northumberland
is willing to be generous.

12:33.255 --> 12:36.055
Um...very generous!

12:36.095 --> 12:40.295
HE CHUCKLES

12:40.335 --> 12:42.855
Very good, Scrope.

12:45.975 --> 12:49.295
I won't be far away. I promise.

12:50.695 --> 12:53.695
And I'll visit whenever I can.

12:59.975 --> 13:01.455
This isn't right.

13:04.335 --> 13:07.695
First you get my son killed,
now you're taking my daughter.

13:09.775 --> 13:11.935
We'll look after her.

13:11.975 --> 13:13.895
Yeah, you better had,

13:13.935 --> 13:17.135
because if anything happens
I'll hold you responsible.

14:07.575 --> 14:09.695
You're so angry we saved you, Kate,

14:09.735 --> 14:12.095
but seriously, what
were you going to do?

14:12.135 --> 14:13.655
Stab the guy?

14:13.695 --> 14:15.415
Well, yeah, if I had to.

14:15.455 --> 14:17.575
He'd be no great loss to the world.

14:17.615 --> 14:19.215
We helped you.

14:19.255 --> 14:21.095
We're giving you a
bed for the night.

14:21.135 --> 14:23.015
Are you not just slightly grateful?

14:23.055 --> 14:25.815
Oh, I'm SO grateful, thank
you for ruining everything(!)

14:25.855 --> 14:28.495
I can really see why you
guys are so legendary(!)

14:28.535 --> 14:31.695
Well, aren't you
sweet and charming, eh?

14:31.735 --> 14:33.295
Aren't you full of yourself?!

14:33.335 --> 14:35.895
Full of myself?

14:35.935 --> 14:37.855
Ah, you've gone too far now, Kate.

14:37.895 --> 14:40.815
I'm wounded, truly,
my heart is broken.

14:40.855 --> 14:43.975
I'm sure some drunken girl with
no taste will make it better.

14:44.015 --> 14:46.655
Funny you should say
that... You all right, Kate?

14:48.255 --> 14:50.055
I'm having the time of my life.

14:54.455 --> 14:55.935
What?!

15:00.175 --> 15:01.815
Did you hear that?

15:01.855 --> 15:04.935
Which bit, Kate being sarcastic
or Kate being ungrateful?

15:04.975 --> 15:08.855
What she said about us! "You
guys are legendary." Plural.

15:08.895 --> 15:11.895
Referring to all of
us, not just Robin.

15:11.935 --> 15:13.935
She may have turned me down,

15:13.975 --> 15:15.855
but she thinks I'm legendary.

15:25.295 --> 15:27.415
When do I get my money?

15:27.455 --> 15:31.455
As soon as Northumberland gets
his troops. Three days, perhaps.

15:35.255 --> 15:40.175
Rufus is collecting the money from
Northumberland's agent at Mansfield.

15:40.215 --> 15:42.375
Put the castle on lock-down.

15:42.415 --> 15:45.175
Nobody goes in or
out without my say,

15:45.215 --> 15:48.375
except Rufus, when
he brings me my money.

15:53.175 --> 15:56.255
Argh!Leave me alone!

15:56.295 --> 15:57.695
COINS SPILL There you go!

15:57.735 --> 15:59.895
Just leave me alone!

16:03.095 --> 16:06.855
Next time you're late with taxes,
you stop breathing. Understood?

16:15.815 --> 16:18.095
Grandfather's shop?

16:18.135 --> 16:20.095
Before it was taken from him.

16:24.255 --> 16:27.135
How old...?17.

16:28.895 --> 16:31.335
Same age you are now.

16:34.735 --> 16:37.575
He used to make me
breakfast every morning.

16:39.655 --> 16:41.815
Bring it up to the door in my room.

16:43.935 --> 16:46.295
He'd say, "Rufus!

16:46.335 --> 16:49.415
"eat it all up, don't go hungry!"

16:49.455 --> 16:52.615
He'd say the same thing every day.

16:54.175 --> 16:56.855
You didn't watch the girl dance.

16:56.895 --> 16:59.975
I told you, the horses. You
didn't want to watch her.

17:00.015 --> 17:03.815
The same way you don't ever
want to watch people suffer.

17:03.855 --> 17:05.335
What's wrong with that?

17:10.375 --> 17:12.095
One day,

17:12.135 --> 17:14.454
Edmund,

17:14.494 --> 17:16.974
I'll have made enough
money to set you up.

17:18.535 --> 17:20.494
Buy you prestige...

17:21.855 --> 17:23.895
respect.

17:24.974 --> 17:28.695
But that means nothing
if you are WEAK!

17:29.895 --> 17:33.615
So weak that someone can just
turn up and take it all from you!

17:33.655 --> 17:35.695
I'm trying!

17:35.735 --> 17:38.175
When I look in your eyes,
do you know what I see?

17:38.215 --> 17:40.815
Uncertainty.

17:40.855 --> 17:44.175
Like you don't even know who
you are. Do you know who you are?

17:44.215 --> 17:46.375
Yes, Father!

17:49.375 --> 17:51.255
That's my boy.

17:55.895 --> 17:57.375
You still here?

17:59.415 --> 18:01.655
The butcher's is mine now.

18:01.695 --> 18:02.855
The shop is all I have.

18:02.895 --> 18:04.055
Edmund!

18:06.015 --> 18:07.935
Hit him till he gets the message.

18:14.375 --> 18:16.015
You've got to go, now, all right?

18:16.055 --> 18:18.015
Believe me, it gets
worse if you don't.

18:21.615 --> 18:23.655
So what happens
next with Robin Hood?

18:23.695 --> 18:26.255
Don't think about him.
He's a distraction.

18:27.855 --> 18:31.015
This matters. What
we're doing here.

18:32.575 --> 18:34.415
Home sweet home.

18:36.695 --> 18:39.055
You can't run away.

18:39.095 --> 18:40.935
Things stay with you.

18:40.975 --> 18:43.095
They stay with you
till you deal with them.

18:46.255 --> 18:50.055
The Sheriff's going to regret
what he did to my father.

19:06.095 --> 19:07.575
Homesick?

19:10.175 --> 19:12.495
No, it's fine.

19:12.535 --> 19:14.015
I can handle it.

19:16.095 --> 19:17.895
I'm not just some stupid girl.

19:19.455 --> 19:21.495
I know you're not.

19:23.615 --> 19:25.415
Maybe I'm a bit homesick.

19:28.095 --> 19:31.455
It gets easier, being an outlaw.

19:35.455 --> 19:38.415
Do you ever get used to
being apart from your family?

19:39.815 --> 19:42.095
No.

19:42.135 --> 19:43.655
You don't get used to that.

19:47.215 --> 19:49.735
That's what I thought.

19:49.775 --> 19:52.055
Whatever happens,

19:52.095 --> 19:54.375
you're not on your own, Kate.

19:58.295 --> 20:00.455
Sounds like a good plan.

20:00.495 --> 20:01.975
Yep, we need to leave now.

20:03.055 --> 20:06.255
So, I know what we're going to do.

20:06.295 --> 20:08.575
We're going to kidnap
the tax collector.

20:08.615 --> 20:10.215
Scare him silly.

20:10.255 --> 20:12.335
And get rid of him,

20:12.375 --> 20:14.095
for good.

20:21.215 --> 20:22.655
Argh!

20:22.695 --> 20:23.855
Taxes.

20:27.615 --> 20:29.935
Ah...!Adding a little
happy to your day?

20:29.975 --> 20:33.615
Yes, oh, yes, very
good... very good...

20:33.655 --> 20:35.775
You have a distinct
talent for this.

20:35.815 --> 20:39.055
As long as you're happy, as long
as the Sheriff gets what he wants.

20:51.775 --> 20:54.735
Did I ever tell you, my
father lived in Nottingham?

20:54.775 --> 20:56.535
He lived here his whole life.

20:56.575 --> 20:58.255
How very pleasant for him.

20:58.295 --> 21:01.255
I don't respect him
much, but he was kind.

21:03.055 --> 21:06.495
Not a single day when I don't
think about him.Oh, how very moving.

21:06.535 --> 21:08.575
La-de-da-de-da...

21:11.095 --> 21:13.455
He took the bait.

21:13.495 --> 21:15.375
Stupid Sheriff.

21:15.415 --> 21:18.815
By the time we're done, that
scum will be crying like a baby.

21:23.895 --> 21:25.495
DOOR CREAKS

21:27.175 --> 21:30.295
Well, we just keep running
into each other, don't we? Eh?

21:30.335 --> 21:31.535
Must be fate.

21:33.055 --> 21:34.175
Father!

21:34.215 --> 21:36.855
HE YELLS

21:37.415 --> 21:38.535
Whoa!

21:39.695 --> 21:40.975
Urgh!

21:41.015 --> 21:44.095
You can't do this! Who's
going to stop us? You?

21:45.815 --> 21:48.615
Argh!Guards! Help!

21:49.895 --> 21:54.615
You heard him, there'll be
guards on the way, come on!

21:57.095 --> 21:58.455
Ready?

22:00.295 --> 22:02.815
Go! Quick, quick...

22:29.095 --> 22:30.095
This side...

22:43.935 --> 22:46.535
Thank you, little lady.

22:46.575 --> 22:50.015
Let me in there, Much.
I'm trying, I'm trying.

22:51.335 --> 22:54.375
I'll get the horses.Oof!
Take her away!

22:55.975 --> 22:57.375
Kate!

22:58.615 --> 23:00.535
Stuff this!

23:00.575 --> 23:02.975
Come on!

23:04.255 --> 23:07.015
They've got Kate! No time! Robin!

23:07.055 --> 23:09.215
He's right.

23:09.255 --> 23:10.775
This way, quick!

23:20.015 --> 23:21.735
Hello?

23:23.575 --> 23:26.255
How about a spot of
kidnapping? Brighten up the day.

23:26.295 --> 23:29.135
Get him on the
horse. Come here, you!

23:31.975 --> 23:32.975
EDMUND!

23:36.095 --> 23:37.095
Father!

23:37.135 --> 23:39.335
Follow me!

24:01.415 --> 24:03.975
Halt! This way.

24:09.735 --> 24:11.455
Father!

24:11.495 --> 24:13.735
Gag him up, Tuck!

24:13.775 --> 24:15.975
Come on! They're
not giving up, Robin!

24:16.015 --> 24:18.255
We've got to go back
for Kate... and Allan.

24:18.295 --> 24:21.095
We can't go back now. If
we live, they have a chance.

24:21.135 --> 24:23.575
Get in!Get down.

24:28.295 --> 24:30.455
MUFFLED CRIES

24:44.015 --> 24:45.575
They could be anywhere.

24:45.615 --> 24:47.415
Search the area.

25:01.215 --> 25:02.695
What now?

25:06.495 --> 25:08.895
You can have your
son back... ECHOES

25:08.935 --> 25:11.415
on one condition.
ECHO:On one condition...

25:11.455 --> 25:12.775
You let our two go.

25:12.815 --> 25:14.535
ECHO:Our two go... Our two go...

25:15.615 --> 25:18.335
You think you can
play me that easy?

25:20.095 --> 25:23.735
I know you have some emotion,
however small.ECHO:However small.

25:23.775 --> 25:26.655
He's your son. I know
you want him back alive.

25:26.695 --> 25:28.495
And you're Robin Hood.

25:28.535 --> 25:30.935
You don't kill unless you have to.

25:30.975 --> 25:33.855
ME, I'm not so sweet.

25:35.655 --> 25:40.095
I've hidden your friends
somewhere you're never gonna find.

25:40.135 --> 25:44.175
So you make sure my
son is back by midday.

25:44.215 --> 25:49.495
And, if you're lucky, your
friends might still be breathing.

25:58.215 --> 25:59.215
Damn!

25:59.255 --> 26:01.495
Damn, damn, damn!

26:03.215 --> 26:05.295
What now, Allan? What happens now?

26:05.335 --> 26:06.935
There's no way out.

26:06.975 --> 26:09.615
Yes, I can see that.

26:14.735 --> 26:16.935
And then Rufus will come...

26:16.975 --> 26:18.455
and we'll be dead.

26:21.615 --> 26:24.175
And how can I help
my family if I'm dead?

26:26.535 --> 26:28.935
They need me!

26:37.255 --> 26:39.695
I've been in worse.

26:39.735 --> 26:41.295
If that helps?

26:41.335 --> 26:42.815
It doesn't help!

26:42.855 --> 26:44.255
It's just annoying...

26:45.295 --> 26:47.775
like you're showing off.

26:47.815 --> 26:50.815
Look, this isn't fun
for me either, you know!

26:52.935 --> 26:55.495
I mean, I'm stuck in
here with you, and...

26:55.535 --> 26:58.375
well, you're not exactly
easy on the eye, are you?

26:58.415 --> 27:01.135
You don't think I'm pretty?

27:01.175 --> 27:03.735
Just a little plain for my taste.

27:03.775 --> 27:05.455
I think your neck's too long.

27:05.495 --> 27:07.495
My neck?!

27:07.535 --> 27:09.015
My nose, maybe.

27:11.775 --> 27:14.455
It's the first time
I've seen you smile.

27:14.495 --> 27:17.735
I wouldn't do it, actually...
it's not your best look.

27:17.775 --> 27:19.215
Do you know,

27:19.255 --> 27:22.415
looking at you actually makes
me want to be a little bit sick.

27:23.975 --> 27:25.455
Do you feel better yet?

27:26.775 --> 27:28.295
Yeah.

27:28.335 --> 27:30.935
Insulting you definitely helps.

27:30.975 --> 27:34.655
Good! Before we carry on
though, you may want to move.

27:34.695 --> 27:36.975
I think you just sat
down on a pig kidney!

27:42.855 --> 27:44.375
I know this man!

27:47.215 --> 27:51.455
What is your family name?
I'm not telling you.You...

27:51.495 --> 27:54.095
Oi, back off, big man, back off!

27:54.135 --> 27:55.895
Course you're not going to tell us.

27:55.935 --> 27:59.495
You've got to be loyal to your
father. A lovely man, it's touching.

27:59.535 --> 28:00.735
He's a good man.

28:00.775 --> 28:03.855
He's the way he is because he had
to be. He never had any choice.

28:03.895 --> 28:05.535
So where will he take them,

28:05.575 --> 28:06.815
this good man?

28:06.855 --> 28:09.815
Even if I knew, I wouldn't
tell you. Even if you did,

28:09.855 --> 28:11.935
we wouldn't believe you.

28:11.975 --> 28:15.575
He's staying at Locksley,
so we'll start there.

28:15.615 --> 28:18.175
Tuck, you stay with this boy.

28:18.215 --> 28:20.815
See if you can get
anything useful out of him.

28:20.855 --> 28:23.055
But don't hurt him...
unless you have to.

28:25.215 --> 28:27.535
HE GROWLS

28:28.535 --> 28:31.855
Ha-ha-ha!You
did well!

28:31.895 --> 28:34.455
Convincing the Sheriff
to part with his troops.

28:34.495 --> 28:36.655
Oh, thank you! Yes, yes...

28:36.695 --> 28:39.615
He wasn't sure at
first, but I told him!

28:39.655 --> 28:43.535
I said, "Sheriff, you need
the money," and he listened.

28:43.575 --> 28:46.095
He listened to ME!To you!

28:46.135 --> 28:47.335
Good boy.

28:47.375 --> 28:53.095
You keep me smiling and that sweet
wife of yours won't be touched, eh?

28:53.135 --> 28:59.455
Yes, um...but the Sheriff,

28:59.495 --> 29:01.095
won't he work it out?

29:01.135 --> 29:02.615
Probably.

29:04.415 --> 29:07.415
Oh...you want him to work it out?

29:07.455 --> 29:10.215
Sharp, aren't you, Scrope?

29:10.255 --> 29:15.175
Nothing gets past you. You see,
I want him to come looking for me

29:15.215 --> 29:19.055
and I want you to help him
to put the pieces together.

29:20.815 --> 29:24.015
Actually, I-I-I'd
rather come with you.

29:24.055 --> 29:25.975
Let him work it out himself.

29:26.015 --> 29:30.575
Sorry, you're no use
to me if you tag along.

29:30.615 --> 29:32.975
Play your part well, Scrope.

29:33.015 --> 29:35.175
Think of your wife.

29:35.215 --> 29:38.175
So what exactly is it that
he wants then, your father?

29:38.215 --> 29:40.375
He's just a tax collector.

29:48.455 --> 29:51.575
Say it again, just for fun.

29:51.615 --> 29:53.415
He's just a tax collector.

29:54.975 --> 29:58.295
You know, when people lie, their
pulse beats a little bit faster.

29:58.335 --> 30:00.535
And Edmund, you just lied.

30:01.815 --> 30:04.695
I thought you were meant
to be one of the good guys.

30:04.735 --> 30:07.535
Well, if I am, what does
that make your father?

30:07.575 --> 30:09.775
The person who's always
been there for me.

30:09.815 --> 30:11.735
He's always tried
to bully you, right?

30:11.775 --> 30:13.735
Tried to turn you into
somebody you're not?

30:13.775 --> 30:16.695
He wants me to be tough and brave.

30:16.735 --> 30:18.295
Violent and manipulative.

30:24.015 --> 30:26.175
But it's not what you
want, though, is it?

30:26.215 --> 30:29.535
You know, you try and hide it,
but there's a kindness in you.

30:31.655 --> 30:34.015
Apparently, I get that
from my grandfather.

30:36.175 --> 30:39.695
And you think that's a flaw, right?

30:39.735 --> 30:41.615
My father says it is.

30:41.655 --> 30:43.255
Well, it's not.

30:43.295 --> 30:46.975
Trust me. Kindness is never a flaw.

30:52.215 --> 30:54.735
There's no-one inside.
The cellar's empty.

30:54.775 --> 30:57.415
The stables are clear.

30:57.455 --> 31:00.415
If we find out who he is,
that'll lead us to them.

31:00.455 --> 31:03.495
Much, go back inside, see
if you can find anything.

31:03.535 --> 31:05.735
John, ask around the village.

31:05.775 --> 31:09.095
If you recognised him,
someone else will have as well.

31:09.135 --> 31:11.535
There's someone I need to talk to.

31:21.135 --> 31:23.095
Are you hungry?

31:23.135 --> 31:24.895
Cos this thing is nearly ready.

31:24.935 --> 31:28.135
If you give me food, you're
going to want something in return.

31:28.175 --> 31:31.095
That's how it normally works.
But what I really want, Edmund,

31:31.135 --> 31:33.895
is for you to think for
yourself. I do think for myself.

31:33.935 --> 31:35.535
Well, that's not strictly true.

31:35.575 --> 31:37.615
And if it was true,

31:37.655 --> 31:39.735
then you never act
on those thoughts.

31:39.775 --> 31:43.375
You suppress them and do what
your father wants instead.

31:43.415 --> 31:46.335
He wants me to grow up. But
Edmund, you have a brain.

31:46.375 --> 31:48.695
You know that's not
what he really means.

31:48.735 --> 31:50.855
He means he wants
you to turn into him.

31:50.895 --> 31:54.975
What would you do, if you were me?

31:55.015 --> 31:58.415
I'd relax and eat some rabbit.

32:03.695 --> 32:06.175
Scrope?

32:06.215 --> 32:07.295
Scrope?

32:07.335 --> 32:09.935
In here, Sheriff. Help!

32:15.335 --> 32:18.335
SCROPE WHIMPERS

32:19.335 --> 32:20.735
My money.

32:20.775 --> 32:22.895
Where is my money,
Scrope? It's not my fault.

32:22.935 --> 32:25.495
He took it. Rufus.

32:25.535 --> 32:27.655
I tried to stop him.

32:27.695 --> 32:31.295
How hard did you try?Really hard.

32:31.335 --> 32:35.655
I hit him in the
face... and I kicked him!

32:35.695 --> 32:37.175
Amazing.

32:37.215 --> 32:39.215
It must have been such a fight.

32:39.255 --> 32:42.055
Yet there's not one
mark on you! GUARDS!

32:42.095 --> 32:43.735
GUARDS!

32:44.775 --> 32:46.375
GUARDS?!

32:48.615 --> 32:51.415
Where are they all?

32:51.455 --> 32:53.655
Northumberland, he
cannot have them all.

32:53.695 --> 32:55.655
They're with Rufus,
at the butcher's.

32:55.695 --> 32:57.175
He bribed them.

32:57.215 --> 32:59.455
You have to go there
if you want them back.

33:01.975 --> 33:05.935
How do you know he bribed them?

33:06.975 --> 33:08.935
I-I-I...saw
him.

33:08.975 --> 33:10.615
Before I hit him.

33:10.655 --> 33:12.815
He was bribing them.

33:12.855 --> 33:14.375
I only found out then.

33:15.655 --> 33:19.615
Scrope, you're lying.

33:19.655 --> 33:21.495
Be honest, confess.

33:21.535 --> 33:25.935
I might find it in myself to be
warm and forgiving and let you live.

33:27.535 --> 33:30.455
R-R-Really?

33:30.495 --> 33:32.055
Oh, yes.

33:32.095 --> 33:36.855
Underneath this harsh
surface, I'm deeply sensitive.

33:36.895 --> 33:39.615
Well, he made me lie.

33:39.655 --> 33:42.615
I didn't want to. He
threatened to hurt my wife!

33:42.655 --> 33:46.135
Oh, Scrope, Scrope.

33:51.095 --> 33:53.215
I lied!

33:53.255 --> 33:59.615
Underneath this harsh surface,
there's just more harsh surface.

34:07.375 --> 34:09.295
You're untying me?

34:09.335 --> 34:11.775
Well, you have to eat.

34:11.815 --> 34:14.175
And you're way too
big to spoon feed.

34:21.815 --> 34:24.455
Go ahead,

34:24.495 --> 34:26.054
pick it up.

34:26.094 --> 34:28.735
Stab me.

34:28.775 --> 34:32.054
Spend the rest of your
life wracked with guilt.

34:32.094 --> 34:33.574
I don't want to kill you.

34:40.255 --> 34:43.054
Family. That's important, right?

34:43.094 --> 34:45.335
Doing things for
people who've been hurt.

34:45.375 --> 34:47.375
Who has been hurt?

34:47.415 --> 34:50.335
Your grandfather?

34:50.375 --> 34:52.735
That's why your
father's here, isn't he?

34:52.775 --> 34:55.094
The Sheriff killed him.

34:55.135 --> 34:57.735
For no reason. Because he could.

34:57.775 --> 35:00.735
Your grandfather was hurt
so your father hurts others.

35:00.775 --> 35:03.255
When it's going to stop, Edmund?

35:03.295 --> 35:06.895
He's my father. I stick by him
because what choice do I have?

35:06.935 --> 35:09.015
You always have choices.

35:09.055 --> 35:12.175
I mean, take Robin Hood.

35:12.215 --> 35:15.815
He could have spent his entire life
lording it over the less fortunate.

35:15.855 --> 35:17.615
But he chose not to.

35:17.655 --> 35:19.495
I'm going and find my friends now.

35:21.055 --> 35:23.895
See if I can be of some use.

35:23.935 --> 35:25.775
So, can I come with you?

35:27.575 --> 35:29.855
And where do you think
we should be going?

35:32.695 --> 35:34.855
To the butcher's shop.

35:37.095 --> 35:39.295
Midday!

35:41.735 --> 35:43.735
And there's no sign of my son.

35:50.575 --> 35:52.495
It's no fun being you.

35:52.535 --> 35:54.735
Your son will be safe.

35:54.775 --> 35:56.255
Robin wouldn't hurt him.

35:56.295 --> 35:58.095
He's not like that.

35:58.135 --> 36:00.615
Robin isn't here to save you now.

36:01.775 --> 36:02.775
Rebecca.

36:05.255 --> 36:08.295
No... Tell me she's all right,
please. Tell me she's all right.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.135
She's been captured,

36:10.175 --> 36:13.935
by the new tax
collector. I am SO sorry.

36:15.095 --> 36:18.375
I can't lose her. She's my baby.

36:18.415 --> 36:20.495
I can't lose her, as well.

36:20.535 --> 36:22.615
Listen, we'll get her back.

36:22.655 --> 36:25.215
I promise. You have my word.

36:26.215 --> 36:27.415
Robin?

36:27.455 --> 36:30.135
Nothing, apart from this.

36:30.175 --> 36:32.055
Oh, Much!Well, it's not Gisborne's!

36:32.095 --> 36:33.655
Look at it.

36:34.655 --> 36:36.855
A butcher's hook!

36:36.895 --> 36:38.175
Chauncey!

36:38.215 --> 36:40.575
That's the family
name!Who? The old butcher.

36:40.615 --> 36:43.935
Now, the butcher, he was
a good man but his son...

36:43.975 --> 36:44.975
I remember him.

36:45.015 --> 36:47.295
He was always angry.

36:47.335 --> 36:50.255
Yeah, always stealing, fighting.
What else can you remember?

36:50.295 --> 36:54.175
Years ago, a girl in the village
got married. D'you remember, John?

36:54.215 --> 36:55.975
Yes, the butcher came with his son.

36:56.015 --> 36:58.495
Everyone had collected money
for the bride and groom,

36:58.535 --> 37:01.575
but during the ceremony the
son - Rufus, that was his name -

37:01.615 --> 37:03.015
he was caught stealing it.

37:03.055 --> 37:05.695
After that, his father
and him disappeared.

37:07.015 --> 37:09.015
Well, he'll go home,

37:09.055 --> 37:13.535
he won't be able to help himself.
He'll go home to the butcher's.

37:19.095 --> 37:20.575
He has them all!

37:32.535 --> 37:34.535
He has ALL my men!

37:34.575 --> 37:36.255
ECHO: Men... Men... Men...

37:49.295 --> 37:50.295
No! Don't!

37:55.775 --> 37:57.495
Are you all right?Yes.

37:57.535 --> 37:59.695
Quick!

37:59.735 --> 38:01.575
Allan,

38:01.615 --> 38:03.975
find all his money. Go, go!

38:07.375 --> 38:09.015
What do you want, Robin Hood?

38:09.055 --> 38:11.095
I want you gone.

38:13.175 --> 38:16.375
I can't go yet, not till
the Sheriff shows his face.

38:32.615 --> 38:34.095
Robin!Robin, wait!

38:34.135 --> 38:37.055
This man is a thief and a bully.

38:39.015 --> 38:41.735
Now, you tell me why I should wait.

38:41.775 --> 38:46.175
He only became a thief because
my grandfather was killed.

38:46.215 --> 38:50.055
No, no, he stole before that.
Robbed a couple on their wedding day.

38:50.095 --> 38:52.695
No, that's not true. Just
don't listen to him, Edmund.

38:52.735 --> 38:55.135
How wonderful.

38:55.175 --> 38:56.935
I came to kill YOU...

38:58.935 --> 39:02.855
..and Robin Hood is doing my
dirty work for me. Tremendous.

39:02.895 --> 39:05.655
This town took my father from me.

39:07.855 --> 39:10.735
YOU took my father from me.

39:10.775 --> 39:14.775
Remember Daniel
Chauncey, the old butcher?

39:17.895 --> 39:20.455
Of course! Yes!

39:20.495 --> 39:24.735
My very first execution!

39:24.775 --> 39:26.335
Now, then! Mmm?

39:26.375 --> 39:28.735
Oh, yes, I thought we've
met somewhere before!

39:28.775 --> 39:31.695
But you see, Rufus, your father
had to die because he stole.

39:31.735 --> 39:35.375
And then he admitted it.Sounds like
he was trying to protect his family.

39:43.735 --> 39:48.335
You see, that's why your
father has got so many ISSUES.

39:50.535 --> 39:54.255
HE...allowed HIS father

39:54.295 --> 39:58.215
to die for a crime HE committed.
No, it wasn't like that.

39:58.255 --> 40:01.415
It was YOU!Temper, temper!

40:01.455 --> 40:03.175
< Mmm?

40:05.135 --> 40:06.415
CLATTERING

40:06.455 --> 40:07.455
Robin!

40:07.495 --> 40:08.495
We found the money!

40:09.575 --> 40:11.255
Money?!

40:11.295 --> 40:13.335
MY money? MY taxes?!

40:13.375 --> 40:15.895
YOU! Give me MY money!

40:19.455 --> 40:20.775
Get after them!

40:24.775 --> 40:26.655
Grandfather wasn't weak.

40:26.695 --> 40:29.135
He was strong
- he died for you!

40:30.735 --> 40:32.255
Shut up now!

40:32.295 --> 40:34.095
Enough!

40:34.135 --> 40:36.975
Stop it! The Sheriff
did it, not me.

40:37.015 --> 40:39.455
We are leaving. Now!

40:39.495 --> 40:42.935
Can you get a clean shot?
There's too many people.

40:42.975 --> 40:44.855
You with me, son?

40:44.895 --> 40:48.255
All he did...was love you.

40:48.295 --> 40:51.215
(Please! Enough!)

40:51.255 --> 40:53.895
He loved you...

40:53.935 --> 40:56.055
and it's your fault that he's dead.

40:56.095 --> 40:57.575
Shut up.

40:59.655 --> 41:00.935
SHUT UP!

41:06.415 --> 41:07.775
CROWD GASP

41:20.815 --> 41:22.015
Remember, son...

41:23.135 --> 41:26.695
the world is hard
on the little people.

41:47.735 --> 41:49.375
Where will you go?

41:49.415 --> 41:54.255
I don't know yet but, um, I'm
looking forward to finding out.

41:54.295 --> 41:56.415
I think you'll be all right.

41:56.455 --> 41:58.255
I will now.

41:58.295 --> 42:02.175
But, um...thank you.

42:04.255 --> 42:05.855
Thank you.

42:21.495 --> 42:23.935
So, just the one night then?

42:23.975 --> 42:26.415
Yes, one night.

42:26.455 --> 42:29.655
I'll be out of your hair tomorrow.

42:29.695 --> 42:32.735
Unless... Unless you
wanted to stay, of course?

42:32.775 --> 42:35.775
Yeah, well, if you guys
wanted me to, you know,

42:35.815 --> 42:38.095
after everything that's happened,

42:38.135 --> 42:40.695
well, it'd be rude to say
no. We want you to stay.

42:40.735 --> 42:43.135
Do we? It's not as if we
need another girl around.

42:43.175 --> 42:44.535
We've got Much.

42:44.575 --> 42:48.255
Kate, I want you to stay.

42:48.295 --> 42:50.495
You're now one of us.

42:53.295 --> 42:54.815
Thank you.

42:54.855 --> 42:56.135
Come on.

42:59.815 --> 43:03.135
Was that actual gratitude?

43:03.175 --> 43:05.655
Yes, but don't expect more of it.

43:05.695 --> 43:07.735
Right now is just a
moment of weakness.

43:07.775 --> 43:09.975
Right, so you'll hate
me again in the morning.

43:10.015 --> 43:12.415
Yeah, maybe even more than before.

43:16.735 --> 43:18.655
I saw her first.

43:27.215 --> 43:29.375
Looking well, Gisborne,
for a dead man.

43:29.415 --> 43:31.655
So Prince John sent
you back with a mission.

43:31.695 --> 43:33.375
He asked me to kill Robin Hood.

43:33.415 --> 43:35.855
Let go!Tell me your name. Isabella.

43:35.895 --> 43:37.975
Gladiators, ready?

43:39.375 --> 43:42.015
We've got Prince John's
elite guards after us.

43:42.055 --> 43:44.175
It's time. Get the
weapon into position.

43:46.895 --> 43:48.095
Isabella!?

43:48.135 --> 43:50.335
There are hundreds of
them. We've been herded,

43:50.375 --> 43:51.815
like lambs to the slaughter.
