21:46.505 --> 21:49.074
- Ari, we still have options.

21:49.108 --> 21:51.076
- Options?
What freakin' options?

21:51.110 --> 21:52.178
Martun is locked up.

21:52.211 --> 21:53.612
My whole family is gone.

21:53.646 --> 21:56.615
I got no money, and I got
Soto Street gunning for me.

21:56.649 --> 21:59.752
- Wow. Sounds like you got
a lot of problems, Ari.

21:59.985 --> 22:01.987
But you know what?

22:02.021 --> 22:03.656
If you find yourself
backed into a corner,

22:03.689 --> 22:06.125
why don't you just--
I don't know--

22:06.158 --> 22:07.526
man up, huh?

22:07.560 --> 22:09.261
Rewrite the playbook, man.

22:09.295 --> 22:11.030
Build your shit
from the ground up.

22:11.030 --> 22:13.299
If they get in your way,
then bowl them over.

22:13.332 --> 22:16.001
That's the--that's the shit
you were doing to me--

22:16.035 --> 22:20.472
that talk that got me into
this shit in the first place.

22:20.506 --> 22:23.642
You are a whispering snake.

22:23.676 --> 22:25.744
- Yeah. Ari...
- You kept pushing me...

22:25.978 --> 22:27.413
and pushing me.
- Ari, we got a problem, man.

22:27.413 --> 22:30.015
Ari, Ari, we got a problem.
Let's go. Let's go.

22:30.049 --> 22:32.218
[tires squealing, gunfire]

22:32.251 --> 22:33.419
Shit.

22:33.419 --> 22:36.522
[gunfire]

22:36.555 --> 22:39.291
[tires squealing]

22:39.291 --> 22:42.294
[indistinct shouting]

22:57.209 --> 22:59.178
- God damn it!
God damn it!

22:59.178 --> 23:01.313
Sons of bitches!

23:01.313 --> 23:02.514
What are you doing?

23:02.548 --> 23:05.050
Guy, guy, this way!

23:05.050 --> 23:06.418
Come on!

23:09.455 --> 23:12.491
Son of a bitch!

23:17.596 --> 23:20.466
Aah!

23:22.701 --> 23:24.036
- I'm out.

23:24.036 --> 23:27.172
[indistinct shouting]

23:27.172 --> 23:28.707
- [groaning loudly]

23:28.707 --> 23:32.311
- That way, that way.
- Son of a bitch!

23:32.311 --> 23:34.213
Aah!

23:36.482 --> 23:39.351
Oh, shit!
You pieces of shit!

23:39.351 --> 23:41.086
You pieces of shit!

24:05.244 --> 24:07.212
Go! Go!
Son of a bitch!

24:07.212 --> 24:09.415
You son of a bitch!

24:09.448 --> 24:11.517
[shouts indistinctly]

24:13.052 --> 24:14.753
- Aah!

24:14.987 --> 24:16.522
[both breathing heavily]

24:16.522 --> 24:18.657
[both groan]
- Shit.

24:18.657 --> 24:21.060
- They're in here!
Come on!

24:21.093 --> 24:22.728
- [groans]
Oh, shit.

24:22.761 --> 24:24.663
[whimpers]
I never been shot before.

24:24.663 --> 24:26.265
- Let's get them!
Let's go!

24:26.265 --> 24:27.466
- Yeah?
How do you like it?

24:27.499 --> 24:28.767
[gunfire]

24:28.968 --> 24:33.238
- [whimpers]
It stings like a piece of shit.

24:33.238 --> 24:36.241
[both groaning,
man shouts indistinctly]

24:39.745 --> 24:41.347
How many you got?

24:41.380 --> 24:43.716
- Five or so.

24:46.485 --> 24:48.387
[gun cocks]
- Not good.

24:48.387 --> 24:51.056
- Not good at all.

24:51.090 --> 24:52.992
Ah.
- Come on!

24:52.992 --> 24:55.060
- Okay, guy,
you always got a plan.

24:55.094 --> 24:56.729
What's the plan?
What do we do now?

24:56.762 --> 24:58.764
Huh?

24:58.998 --> 24:59.765
- Come on out!

24:59.999 --> 25:02.501
- We lick our wounds,
and we wait.

25:02.534 --> 25:04.536
We wait.

25:12.678 --> 25:17.282
D.C. has you pegged
as some sort of ideologue...

25:17.282 --> 25:21.153
that you lack
a kind of base pragmatism.

25:21.153 --> 25:25.691
I believe the phrase
"boy scout" was in utterance.

25:29.028 --> 25:33.399
Frankly, I didn't think
you'd make the right decision.

25:33.432 --> 25:36.101
- Is that what this is?

25:36.135 --> 25:38.537
The right decision?

25:38.537 --> 25:40.572
'Cause as far
as I'm concerned,

25:40.572 --> 25:42.141
that right there
is the last

25:42.174 --> 25:43.675
in a long line
of wrong decisions.

25:43.709 --> 25:46.178
- [chuckles]
Here we go.

25:46.178 --> 25:48.447
- You know...

25:48.447 --> 25:50.416
when this all started,

25:50.449 --> 25:52.584
we sat in here,
and you looked me in the eye,

25:52.584 --> 25:56.321
and you told me that I was
responsible for too many deaths.

25:56.321 --> 25:58.290
You were right.

25:58.323 --> 26:01.193
So I set out
to change that.

26:01.226 --> 26:03.395
And what did we get?

26:03.429 --> 26:06.131
We got Samuel O'Malley,
Colby Moore,

26:06.165 --> 26:09.234
Toros Berbarian,
Javier Arrabuena.

26:09.268 --> 26:11.236
- Every fight
has collateral damage.

26:11.270 --> 26:12.371
- Yeah.

26:12.404 --> 26:14.973
Except all those people
would still be alive

26:15.007 --> 26:16.642
if it wasn't for you.

26:18.544 --> 26:20.379
If there were any semblance
of justice in this world,

26:20.412 --> 26:22.548
you'd be paying for that.

26:22.581 --> 26:25.284
But instead, there's this.

26:25.317 --> 26:28.620
There's a tidy, little lie,
where you come out victorious.

26:28.620 --> 26:31.056
Congratulations.

26:31.090 --> 26:32.691
- Thank you.

26:32.724 --> 26:34.760
- Don't thank me yet.

26:34.760 --> 26:37.696
You haven't heard
my demands.

26:41.333 --> 26:44.269
- You lied to me.

26:44.303 --> 26:45.671
- Yeah.

26:45.704 --> 26:48.140
And you lied to me
from the start, Vin.

26:48.173 --> 26:50.409
- I didn't know
what I was doing, man.

26:50.442 --> 26:53.679
I just wanted the money.

26:53.712 --> 26:56.615
I try to be a good Bali man,
I get nothing.

26:56.648 --> 26:59.351
I try to be an American...

26:59.351 --> 27:01.220
it's much worse, man.

27:03.088 --> 27:05.757
Maybe I did something terrible
in last life.

27:05.991 --> 27:07.526
[groans]

27:07.526 --> 27:10.395
After all this, Vin...

27:10.395 --> 27:13.098
you can't still possibly
believe in karma.

27:13.132 --> 27:16.335
- Of course I do.

27:16.368 --> 27:19.505
- This wasn't
the machinations of Shiva.

27:19.505 --> 27:21.173
This was Paul Briggs.

27:21.206 --> 27:22.508
- [inhales deeply]

27:22.508 --> 27:24.510
You know,
you were a better person

27:24.510 --> 27:27.012
when you believed
in something.

27:39.658 --> 27:42.528
- There's a bus station
a mile north.

27:42.528 --> 27:45.330
Takes you direct to LAX.

27:49.568 --> 27:51.270
You're free.

27:52.538 --> 27:53.739
- Mike?

28:00.145 --> 28:02.381
- Don't thank me yet.

28:02.414 --> 28:05.350
You haven't heard
my demands.

28:38.584 --> 28:41.286
- How you doing, guy?

28:41.320 --> 28:42.554
Huh?

28:42.588 --> 28:43.555
- [shouts indistinctly]

28:43.589 --> 28:46.158
You with me?

28:46.191 --> 28:48.293
- Yeah.
Yeah, I'm with you.

28:48.327 --> 28:49.428
- Hey...

28:49.461 --> 28:50.562
- Over this way!

28:50.596 --> 28:52.564
You need to get right.

28:52.598 --> 28:55.567
I ain't dying in here.

28:55.601 --> 28:58.170
At some point,
these sons of bitches--

28:58.203 --> 29:00.038
they got to eat.

29:00.072 --> 29:02.441
They got to sleep.

29:02.474 --> 29:06.511
Then we make
our move, right?

29:09.982 --> 29:12.751
- [shouts indistinctly]

29:12.985 --> 29:14.753
- You know,
when I was a kid, they--

29:14.987 --> 29:16.221
they took my class
to the zoo

29:16.255 --> 29:20.092
to see the oldest tiger
in captivity--Orson.

29:20.125 --> 29:21.627
[chuckles]

29:21.660 --> 29:26.365
Ah, he was a--
an incredible animal, really.

29:26.398 --> 29:28.100
22...

29:28.133 --> 29:30.736
man, that's a lot of years
for a tiger.

29:30.969 --> 29:32.471
- Come around this way!

29:32.504 --> 29:33.739
- His eyes were rheumy.

29:33.972 --> 29:35.474
His knees were...

29:35.507 --> 29:37.609
buckling.

29:37.643 --> 29:40.379
The trainers
had to feed him by hand.

29:42.648 --> 29:44.082
It was just sad.

29:44.116 --> 29:46.351
Yeah.

29:46.385 --> 29:50.122
They took that beautiful
specimen out of the jungle,

29:50.155 --> 29:53.692
and they propped him up
to watch him wither.

29:56.161 --> 29:58.130
[sighs]

29:58.163 --> 30:00.999
Maybe this is what's best.

30:01.033 --> 30:03.402
A tiger's not meant
to get old.

30:06.271 --> 30:08.507
- [scoffs]
You keep your fatalism.

30:08.540 --> 30:10.976
I'm gonna be free...

30:11.009 --> 30:13.245
to have a drink of arak,

30:13.278 --> 30:15.981
have another kebab,

30:16.014 --> 30:18.250
stroke another pootz.

30:18.283 --> 30:20.252
[clatter, gunfire]

30:20.285 --> 30:23.288
[indistinct shouting]

30:25.023 --> 30:26.525
- Get down!
Down on your knees!

30:26.558 --> 30:29.528
Get down, asshole!

30:29.561 --> 30:31.029
Paul?

30:31.063 --> 30:33.699
Paul, you up here?

30:33.732 --> 30:36.702
[shouting continues]

30:38.670 --> 30:41.306
[door opens]

30:46.044 --> 30:49.147
- Ah, shit.

30:49.147 --> 30:50.215
Ah...

30:55.053 --> 30:57.022
- Hey, you got to check
a calendar, John boy.

30:57.055 --> 30:59.124
- [chuckles]
No, it's for Charlie's party.

30:59.157 --> 31:00.425
- Oh, word?

31:00.425 --> 31:02.160
- I figured she bought
all these weird-ass ornaments,

31:02.160 --> 31:03.428
so figured might
as well throw her

31:03.428 --> 31:05.263
a birthday/Christmas party,
you know?

31:05.297 --> 31:07.032
- Yeah, she been trippin'
on the ornaments lately.

31:07.032 --> 31:08.433
- Yo!

31:08.433 --> 31:10.268
[laughing] Yo.
- Ha ha.

31:10.268 --> 31:12.404
What you think, man?
- I-I digs it.

31:12.404 --> 31:13.638
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

31:13.672 --> 31:15.707
You kind of look
like me--

31:15.741 --> 31:18.377
a little, dark-skinned Mexican.
[both laugh]

31:18.410 --> 31:20.579
Yo, where you, uh--
where you going with that?

31:20.579 --> 31:22.180
- Yeah.
No, Charlie and I talked.

31:22.180 --> 31:23.548
Um, change of plans.

31:23.582 --> 31:25.584
- Oh, yeah?
Well, you--

31:25.584 --> 31:29.121
If I call Charlie,
she's gonna vouch for this plan?

31:29.154 --> 31:31.022
Yeah?

31:31.056 --> 31:34.192
Tell me--tell me you're joking
with me right now.

31:34.192 --> 31:35.460
- Just get
out of my way, Johnny.

31:35.494 --> 31:37.028
- All right, D,
that ain't your money.

31:37.062 --> 31:38.463
- It's nobody's money.
- It don't matter.

31:38.463 --> 31:39.998
Look, it don't matter.
People are gonna know.

31:40.031 --> 31:41.199
Charlie's gonna know.

31:41.233 --> 31:43.034
You think that girl's
not gonna say something

31:43.034 --> 31:46.138
about a missing $9 million?

31:46.171 --> 31:48.974
Brother, look at me.

31:49.007 --> 31:52.043
They will come for you.

31:52.043 --> 31:54.446
Y-you know that, right?

31:54.479 --> 31:56.748
All the agencies, everybody,
me included.

31:56.982 --> 31:58.550
- Let them come.

31:58.583 --> 32:01.153
- Yo, look--
look around you, man.

32:01.186 --> 32:02.320
You got a good life here.

32:02.354 --> 32:03.355
- Where, man?

32:03.388 --> 32:05.223
Where--where's
this good life, Johnny?

32:05.223 --> 32:08.059
I don't got a good life.

32:08.093 --> 32:09.694
I haven't been happy
in years, man.

32:09.728 --> 32:11.430
It's been years!

32:11.463 --> 32:14.433
I came out here to raise my kid.
I can't even see my kid.

32:14.466 --> 32:16.168
I don't got a good life.
I got no life!

32:16.201 --> 32:18.069
- You got us.
You got us.

32:18.103 --> 32:19.671
You got me. You got the house.
- The house--

32:19.704 --> 32:22.707
This house is full
of backstabbers and liars.

32:22.741 --> 32:24.142
We're all going to prison

32:24.176 --> 32:25.544
because of the people
in this goddamn house!

32:25.577 --> 32:27.212
- No, we're not. No, we're not.
- Yeah.

32:27.212 --> 32:29.080
- No, we're not. Mike's gonna
sign off on the HSI report.

32:29.114 --> 32:30.348
It's gonna go back
to the way it was.

32:30.382 --> 32:32.417
- I don't want it to be back
to the way it was, man.

32:32.451 --> 32:34.419
I want her.

32:34.453 --> 32:36.688
That's what I want.

32:36.721 --> 32:39.458
Courtney...

32:39.491 --> 32:41.326
she doesn't know you.

32:41.359 --> 32:44.062
I'm sorry to be the one to have
to tell you that, man, okay?

32:44.095 --> 32:45.464
But she don't know you.

32:45.497 --> 32:48.266
Trust me,
I've been there.

32:48.300 --> 32:50.469
You cannot start a life
on a lie--

32:50.502 --> 32:52.437
- The moment I walk out that
door, there's no more lying.

32:52.471 --> 32:54.439
- You're not walking
out the door.

32:56.074 --> 32:57.509
- You can't stop me.

32:57.509 --> 33:00.645
- I can't let you do it.

33:00.645 --> 33:02.747
Jakes, just--

33:02.981 --> 33:05.250
Don't do this, man.
- Don't push me, Johnny.

33:39.017 --> 33:42.153
- God damn it, Jakes.
Don't do this, man.

33:42.153 --> 33:44.689
Don't do it.

33:44.723 --> 33:47.692
Don't do it, man.
Please, man.

33:47.692 --> 33:50.128
[whimpers]

33:50.161 --> 33:52.764
- I love you, Johnny.

33:54.165 --> 33:55.500
Always will, man.

34:11.583 --> 34:14.519
[door opens, closes]

34:22.327 --> 34:24.729
- On your knees now.
- Shut up! Don't look at me.

34:24.729 --> 34:26.464
