WEBVTT

00:15.640 --> 00:19.269
- Wow, your drawing skill is better now.
- Really?

00:19.394 --> 00:22.063
Hey, this is an alien story.
Here's a monster.

00:22.188 --> 00:23.481
This is great!

00:23.606 --> 00:24.899
She's the main character's girlfriend.

00:25.984 --> 00:27.027
This is a love story.

00:28.319 --> 00:31.197
Do you really want my honest opinion?

00:32.282 --> 00:33.324
Apart from the poor drawing,

00:33.450 --> 00:35.535
the story is way too boring.

00:35.660 --> 00:37.203
I don't want to look at this anymore!

00:37.328 --> 00:39.539
That's weird. She said it was funny.

00:39.664 --> 00:42.500
Who said? Who said so?

00:42.792 --> 00:43.752
Who the hell--

00:47.297 --> 00:49.132
Hilarious!

00:50.675 --> 00:51.843
Is this really that funny?

00:53.344 --> 00:58.308
When you read something really funny,
you snort like a pig, huh?

00:58.433 --> 00:59.684
Oh, it's funny!

01:04.272 --> 01:08.318
I don't have time for this.
Don't bring me anything else this lame.

01:08.443 --> 01:12.113
Your diary
has to be better than this story.

01:23.124 --> 01:27.253
CHO SEOK'S DIARY

01:32.759 --> 01:34.677
- Where are you going?
- Where am I going?

01:34.803 --> 01:37.430
Where else would I go at this hour?
A nightclub!

01:38.139 --> 01:40.141
What kind of girls
shall I hit on tonight?

01:41.267 --> 01:43.061
Would they say "yes"
if you hit on them?

01:44.270 --> 01:47.357
You're... still too young.

01:59.410 --> 02:03.832
Right, there was nothing I could have
as I wished.

02:03.957 --> 02:06.709
Except one thing, women!

02:07.877 --> 02:12.006
Even if Casanova
and Don Juan came back,

02:12.132 --> 02:15.426
they couldn't beat me, Jun Cho.

02:17.220 --> 02:18.263
- Hey, Hun!
- Hi.

02:20.765 --> 02:25.562
Are you the legendary Jun Cho with
the 98-percent girl-hunting success rate?

02:25.687 --> 02:27.147
I'm here to add the remaining two percent!

02:27.605 --> 02:29.732
From tonight,
the rate will be 100 percent!

02:30.108 --> 02:32.694
Once he hits on a girl,
she says "yes" right away!

02:43.997 --> 02:48.960
No woman refuses me
when I choose her.

02:52.255 --> 02:54.966
Hi, wanna dance?

02:59.387 --> 03:03.683
The key is not to choose a pretty girl.

03:04.976 --> 03:10.940
I don't fight a losing battle.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.074
Seok, do you think that's funny?

03:20.199 --> 03:23.786
Who on earth would put on that outfit?

03:27.665 --> 03:29.792
What?

03:29.918 --> 03:32.086
Where's Mom?

03:32.211 --> 03:33.963
I'm hungry.

03:34.088 --> 03:36.758
- Crazy.
- Mom!

03:36.883 --> 03:40.094
My TV has been a problem.

03:40.220 --> 03:41.638
Should I buy a new one?

03:41.763 --> 03:45.475
You can fix it by hitting it.
Don't buy a new one.

03:47.644 --> 03:51.522
- Hon, this TV is not working.
- Buy a new one!

03:51.648 --> 03:53.441
Don't be such a miser!

03:53.566 --> 03:55.235
Mom, this vacuum is not working.

03:55.360 --> 03:57.737
- Get a new one!
- Right.

03:58.321 --> 04:01.908
Yeah? Give me that. I can fix it.

04:02.033 --> 04:03.201
Really?

04:03.326 --> 04:05.245
The guy at customer service said
he couldn't fix it.

04:20.426 --> 04:21.886
You can fix everything by hitting it.

04:22.011 --> 04:24.472
Don't waste your money.
Just repair it.

04:24.597 --> 04:26.808
You never get rich by being frugal.

04:26.933 --> 04:28.810
I bought a brand new air conditioner.

04:28.935 --> 04:32.689
I can turn it on and off
with my cell phone, see?

04:33.982 --> 04:35.149
Turn it on!

04:37.819 --> 04:39.529
That's amazing!

04:39.654 --> 04:42.865
Those high-tech appliances are
really different.

04:42.991 --> 04:47.370
You can't buy something like this
on your husband's income.

04:47.495 --> 04:50.873
What? Are you crazy?

04:50.999 --> 04:54.377
Who doesn't have such a thing these days?
I have one at home.

04:57.588 --> 04:58.673
CHEOL-WANG CHO

05:02.844 --> 05:03.678
Hi, honey.

05:03.803 --> 05:05.888
Turn on the air conditioner.

05:15.356 --> 05:19.068
I can have the filters cleaned.

05:19.610 --> 05:21.988
Clean the filters.

05:27.327 --> 05:30.997
Stop bragging.
That's one of the basic functions.

05:35.043 --> 05:37.211
Clean the filters.

05:37.962 --> 05:40.256
What? The filters? Okay.

05:45.511 --> 05:49.140
- How amazing!
- Can it do anything else?

05:49.265 --> 05:52.477
Mine even moves around on its own.

05:52.602 --> 05:55.313
If yours can't do that,
you should throw it away.

05:55.438 --> 05:58.483
An air conditioner that moves around
on its own?

05:59.400 --> 06:03.446
- Move to the bedroom.
- What?

06:07.450 --> 06:11.537
Oh, my gosh! So amazing!

06:11.662 --> 06:15.416
Don't mess with me.
I'm Jeong-kwon Kwon.

06:19.420 --> 06:23.174
- Like it?
- Am I supposed to laugh?

06:25.426 --> 06:27.804
She looks like hell.
What's wrong with her?

06:33.476 --> 06:37.063
Currently, many parents are having
their young children learn English.

06:37.188 --> 06:39.690
They speak English
in their daily lives--

06:39.816 --> 06:41.943
Your mom wouldn't have thought about that.

06:42.068 --> 06:43.903
She wasn't good at educating you two.

06:44.028 --> 06:46.739
Right, we're not good at English
because of her.

06:46.864 --> 06:49.033
What? It's not too late.

06:49.158 --> 06:52.954
I wasn't good at educating,
so I want to make it up to you guys.

06:53.079 --> 06:56.791
From now on, we speak
only English in this house!

06:56.916 --> 06:58.626
If a Korean word slips out of your mouth,

06:58.751 --> 07:00.753
- you must pay eight dollars.
- Boo!

07:00.878 --> 07:03.381
No, I can't do that! I won't do that!

07:03.506 --> 07:04.423
Starting now!

07:04.549 --> 07:06.759
Shit! Oh, my God!

07:06.884 --> 07:08.302
I'm a boy, you're a girl.

07:08.427 --> 07:09.929
No, no, no, no, no!

07:10.054 --> 07:12.306
I like yogurt.

07:18.187 --> 07:20.106
Oh, I need that kettle.

07:20.982 --> 07:22.942
I'm thirsty.

07:23.067 --> 07:24.986
SON!

07:25.445 --> 07:26.279
PASS ME THE KETTLE.

07:26.779 --> 07:27.738
THIS ONE?

07:27.864 --> 07:29.532
RIGHT.

07:29.824 --> 07:31.492
HERE IT IS.

07:32.493 --> 07:33.327
Okay.

07:35.288 --> 07:36.164
Good.

07:41.836 --> 07:43.921
SON, GIVE ME THE REMOTE.

07:44.422 --> 07:46.382
OKAY.

07:47.258 --> 07:48.301
DAD.

07:48.426 --> 07:50.511
A REALLY FUNNY SHOW IS ON CHANNEL 4.

07:50.720 --> 07:51.596
RIGHT?

07:51.846 --> 07:53.723
I'M SWITCHING TO CHANNEL 4.

07:53.848 --> 07:54.682
LET'S WATCH IT.

07:54.807 --> 07:55.725
ENGLISH LISTENING TEST RESULTS
BY COUNTRY

07:59.228 --> 08:00.938
YOU HAVE NO CLUE
WHAT WE'RE TALKING ABOUT.

08:01.063 --> 08:04.275
STOP TEASING HER,
OR YOU'LL GET PUNCHED.

08:04.400 --> 08:07.445
WE HAVE NO PROBLEM COMMUNICATING!
ENGLISH IS SO EASY.

08:07.570 --> 08:09.739
WE CAN GO ON
LIKE THIS FOREVER, HAHA

08:13.743 --> 08:15.536
GOOD MORNING, DAD.

08:16.370 --> 08:19.415
GOOD MORNING.

08:19.540 --> 08:22.001
DAD, HAVE SOME BREAKFAST.

08:22.126 --> 08:23.753
LET'S HAVE A GLASS OF WATER FIRST.

08:23.878 --> 08:26.255
THAT'S GOOD FOR YOUR HEALTH.

08:26.380 --> 08:28.341
Stop it!

08:31.844 --> 08:32.929
GIVE ME MONEY.

08:33.971 --> 08:34.805
GIVE ME MONEY.

08:34.931 --> 08:35.890
EIGHT DOLLARS

08:40.144 --> 08:41.812
Oh, money!

08:45.233 --> 08:47.151
NO USE REGRETTING IT NOW.

08:54.325 --> 08:57.203
- You!
- Why?

08:58.579 --> 09:01.207
- You!
- Why?

09:07.421 --> 09:09.882
Ooh! Why?

09:11.884 --> 09:14.637
Why?

09:20.101 --> 09:21.269
You!

09:24.564 --> 09:27.817
- Why?
- Shit!

09:43.207 --> 09:44.417
DO YOU WANT TO DIE?

09:45.418 --> 09:48.170
"Do you want to die?"

09:50.590 --> 09:51.882
"Before I break..."

09:54.969 --> 09:59.473
"your wrist."

10:02.226 --> 10:03.769
"Pick it up!"

10:09.358 --> 10:11.652
Goal!

10:12.778 --> 10:14.196
PICK IT UP!

10:14.322 --> 10:15.615
Hey!

10:18.409 --> 10:19.869
"Do you want to die?"

10:24.665 --> 10:26.709
Dad, do you know
how much an English class costs?

10:26.834 --> 10:28.878
- It's very expensive!
- Really?

10:29.003 --> 10:32.256
But I can't say what I want to say.
I can't take it anymore!

10:32.923 --> 10:34.634
How much is this English class?

10:34.759 --> 10:36.302
It's $250.

10:36.427 --> 10:39.096
Wow! That's so expensive!

10:42.558 --> 10:45.227
I have no choice.

10:51.275 --> 10:54.820
Because of English,
I'm doing this at my age.

10:54.945 --> 10:56.405
Because of English!

10:57.823 --> 11:02.328
Oh, shit!

11:02.453 --> 11:05.206
You did a good job.
There's your weekly pay.

11:05.498 --> 11:06.666
- Thank you!
- Sure!

11:06.791 --> 11:08.542
Good job!

11:08.668 --> 11:10.503
You did a good job.

11:16.509 --> 11:19.720
- Mom, I'm hungry.
- What?

11:21.097 --> 11:25.309
- Hey, please, Mom.
- What?

11:35.319 --> 11:36.695
Give me something to eat!

11:38.656 --> 11:39.824
I have money, see?

11:39.949 --> 11:40.866
How much do you want?

11:40.991 --> 11:45.121
How much do you need?

11:47.957 --> 11:50.501
What an obedient wife you are!

11:50.626 --> 11:53.212
How much do you want?

11:53.337 --> 11:54.964
How much do you need?

12:02.304 --> 12:04.640
That's us? Are you crazy?

12:04.765 --> 12:06.517
Didn't I tell you?
He has no talent.

12:06.642 --> 12:08.978
Who's going to like this kind of story?

12:09.103 --> 12:10.688
Other families live like this, too.

12:15.401 --> 12:18.362
Got anything else?
Never mind.

12:24.326 --> 12:26.620
Okay, let's quit now.

12:30.875 --> 12:34.211
Your diary
has to be better than this story.

12:36.839 --> 12:40.050
The more I think about him,
the more I hate him.

12:40.718 --> 12:42.928
Should I send him this anyway?

12:43.721 --> 12:46.348
Here! See if this interests you!

12:50.102 --> 12:52.021
What is it? From Seok Cho?

12:52.146 --> 12:53.314
Did this dork...

12:53.439 --> 12:54.690
really send his own diary?

12:54.815 --> 12:55.691
FROM SEOK CHO
THE DIARY YOU WANTED TO SEE

12:55.858 --> 12:57.526
THE SOUND OF YOUR HEART

13:01.906 --> 13:03.824
FROM NOW ON, WE SPEAK
ONLY ENGLISH IN THIS HOUSE!

13:05.493 --> 13:06.869
WEBTOON GUY

13:08.871 --> 13:10.831
What's he calling about?

13:13.959 --> 13:16.629
No, I'm not meeting him anymore.
I can say whatever I want now.

13:16.754 --> 13:19.423
Yes, I'm picking up, you jerk!

13:20.341 --> 13:24.678
Hello. Yes, I sent it.

13:25.638 --> 13:28.849
Why? Didn't you say it would be funny?

13:28.974 --> 13:31.769
Yes, it's hilarious.

13:31.894 --> 13:32.770
What?

13:32.895 --> 13:35.731
It's funny! I could've died laughing!

13:35.856 --> 13:38.734
Hey, man, I'm sorry.

13:38.859 --> 13:40.277
- But you need not--
- Anyway,

13:40.402 --> 13:41.695
At first I thought you sent
your real diary.

13:41.820 --> 13:43.614
You should've drawn this kind of comedy
from the beginning.

13:43.739 --> 13:45.616
I almost laughed myself to death.

13:45.741 --> 13:48.994
Weird. Is it really funny?

13:49.119 --> 13:51.747
You've made me laugh my head off,
I'm telling you.

13:51.872 --> 13:53.916
You're so imaginative.

13:54.041 --> 13:55.125
- I'm what?
- Are you a genius?

13:55.251 --> 13:58.254
By the way, what's the title?

13:58.379 --> 14:02.466
Oh, well--

14:02.758 --> 14:06.428
THE BIRTH OF THE SOUND
OF YOUR HEART

14:12.142 --> 14:14.436
His work will appear in a series soon.

14:14.562 --> 14:17.022
My son's webtoon will be posted
every week.

14:17.481 --> 14:18.357
How amazing!

14:18.482 --> 14:22.027
I noticed his talent when he was young,
so I supported him.

14:22.152 --> 14:23.445
You're kidding!

14:23.571 --> 14:26.782
You gave him a punch every day,
and told him to "stop scribbling."

14:26.907 --> 14:30.452
The main character is a pretty lady.

14:30.578 --> 14:33.372
- That's me.
- Is it a horror webtoon?

14:33.497 --> 14:36.292
- What the hell--?
- Stop arguing!

14:36.667 --> 14:39.253
So, what genre does it fall into?

14:39.378 --> 14:42.339
Since I appear in it,
I suppose it's a romantic love story.

14:42.464 --> 14:45.968
I appear in my son's webtoon.

14:46.093 --> 14:48.095
- Oh, great!
- I'm the main character.

14:48.220 --> 14:49.513
What kind of webtoon is that?

14:49.638 --> 14:51.640
Noir, of course!

14:51.765 --> 14:55.728
I have a big fight against 13 villains.

14:55.853 --> 15:00.024
- Wow!
- You should pay the tab today.

15:00.149 --> 15:02.276
- Right?
- It's on you!

15:04.528 --> 15:05.404
Who's coming?

15:05.529 --> 15:08.574
I thought you were meeting a girl,
so I chose European fashion.

15:08.699 --> 15:10.576
- Your girlfriend?
- No, just a friend.

15:10.701 --> 15:12.578
- She's buying dinner to congratulate me.
- Oh, no!

15:12.995 --> 15:15.080
You should go meet your friends.

15:15.539 --> 15:16.415
I'll go after dinner.

15:17.541 --> 15:20.127
- She's here. Ae-bong!
- Oh, hi!

15:20.669 --> 15:22.254
Ae-bong, this is my brother.

15:22.379 --> 15:25.591
- Nice to meet you.
- Hi.

15:26.342 --> 15:27.426
WEBTOON GUY

15:27.551 --> 15:29.094
Wait, I have to talk to this guy.

15:33.724 --> 15:36.769
- Have a seat.
- Okay.

15:38.437 --> 15:41.482
- Seok told me about you a lot.
- Yeah, he talked about you a lot, too.

15:41.607 --> 15:44.109
- What did he say about me?
- I'll do my best.

15:44.318 --> 15:45.986
- Have your tea.
- Oh.

15:49.573 --> 15:51.825
Yes, yes!

15:51.951 --> 15:54.119
Yes, yes!

15:56.997 --> 15:59.917
Oh, he's lost his mind at last.

16:00.334 --> 16:01.502
When will he ever be normal?

16:01.627 --> 16:04.463
Stop looking at him.
It's not good for you.

16:15.265 --> 16:16.558
She's laughing.

16:18.268 --> 16:22.564
Whenever I wanted to give up
on my dream,

16:24.108 --> 16:25.359
I thought of her smile.

16:25.484 --> 16:27.945
She's smiling again.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.541
Get up, wake up!

16:40.666 --> 16:42.459
- Yeah?
- Get up and try them on.

16:42.584 --> 16:45.170
Did you buy those for me?

16:47.923 --> 16:48.882
A scarf?

16:50.426 --> 16:53.595
- Oh.
- Wow!

16:54.054 --> 16:55.556
Great!

16:55.681 --> 16:57.224
Really? How do I look?

16:57.850 --> 16:59.893
- Yeah, good.
- Cool!

17:00.019 --> 17:02.062
You look much younger, Dad.
Mom, where's mine?

17:02.187 --> 17:03.480
You've got enough clothes to wear.

17:06.984 --> 17:09.403
Stop wearing jackets like a young boy.

17:09.528 --> 17:10.904
Your clothes must reflect your age.

17:11.030 --> 17:13.449
I see. Thank you, honey.

17:13.574 --> 17:15.534
- Looks nice.
- Handsome?

17:15.659 --> 17:18.370
Do I look handsome or what?

17:23.751 --> 17:25.878
Is this Dad's?

17:26.003 --> 17:28.172
Looks nice.

17:28.297 --> 17:30.340
Now, all I need is a girlfriend.

17:30.466 --> 17:32.634
I'll go out and get one.

17:35.095 --> 17:37.222
- Mom, I'm going out!
- Okay.

17:39.058 --> 17:41.185
Oh, I forgot!

17:41.310 --> 17:43.103
The supermarket is having a sale today.

17:49.485 --> 17:52.071
Ugh, it must have been
something I ate.

17:53.530 --> 17:56.366
I need to go to the bathroom.

17:57.409 --> 17:58.994
How many times have I gone so far?

18:06.668 --> 18:07.544
Huh?

18:09.797 --> 18:11.632
Hello.

18:13.258 --> 18:15.260
When did he leave home?

18:15.385 --> 18:17.763
What's he buying?

18:17.888 --> 18:20.724
For a man who's no good at making money
he's really good at spending it.

18:26.772 --> 18:28.065
Oh, this one.

18:33.320 --> 18:34.988
Where are you?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.990
- Home.
- What?

18:37.116 --> 18:40.202
- Home?
- Yeah.

18:40.327 --> 18:42.204
I'm home now.

18:42.329 --> 18:45.582
Hey, cutie, I'll be there soon.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.254
- You're at home?
- Yeah, I said.

18:50.963 --> 18:52.798
Okay.

18:57.052 --> 18:59.721
He's lying. What's he doing?

19:05.018 --> 19:06.436
ILK BANK

19:07.354 --> 19:09.606
REAL ESTATE AGENT

19:13.944 --> 19:14.820
A ROOM FOR YOU

19:18.031 --> 19:20.576
DOPPELGANGER

19:25.455 --> 19:28.876
At this expensive coffee shop?

19:29.543 --> 19:31.044
Something's fishy.

19:36.341 --> 19:37.676
Hi.

19:38.302 --> 19:41.221
- Hi, how long did you wait for me?
- Not that long.

19:42.598 --> 19:44.183
A gift for you.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.809
What's this?

19:48.562 --> 19:52.149
Oh, Jun!

19:52.900 --> 19:54.151
So pretty.

19:54.902 --> 19:57.654
Who is that bitch?

19:57.779 --> 20:00.073
What are you doing this weekend?

20:00.199 --> 20:01.825
I've got no plans.

20:03.076 --> 20:04.244
How about you?

20:05.037 --> 20:06.413
I'll be super busy.

20:06.538 --> 20:10.083
Oh, really?

20:10.209 --> 20:12.252
I have a date with you,
so I'll be super busy.

20:15.380 --> 20:16.840
Oh, my gosh!

20:16.965 --> 20:20.302
Cheol-wang, are you cheating on me

20:20.427 --> 20:22.346
with that young girl?

20:23.847 --> 20:27.100
- I need to go to the washroom.
- Okay.

20:28.143 --> 20:32.606
Wait, come back soon.
I think I'm going to miss you.

20:32.731 --> 20:34.066
Oh, stop it!

20:45.994 --> 20:48.288
- Bitch!
- Who is this?

20:48.413 --> 20:50.624
Why would a young girl like you

20:50.749 --> 20:52.292
have an affair with my husband?

20:52.417 --> 20:54.253
Who are you? Are you crazy?

20:54.378 --> 20:59.675
I'm his wife, and we have two kids!

21:00.133 --> 21:01.426
Oh, shit!

21:03.804 --> 21:05.806
Did you push me?

21:05.931 --> 21:07.224
You're gonna die today!

21:11.728 --> 21:12.688
You're back--

21:12.813 --> 21:15.357
Asshole, I'll kill you!

21:15.482 --> 21:18.777
How dare you do that to me?

21:18.902 --> 21:19.861
How did you find out?

21:20.529 --> 21:23.240
- Sorry, I'm sorry!
- You asshole!

21:25.742 --> 21:28.078
- Where is he?
- He ran away.

21:42.050 --> 21:43.343
Taxi, taxi!

21:45.929 --> 21:49.182
Please, follow that taxi.
Oh, that bastard.

21:49.308 --> 21:50.892
- Just follow that one?
- Yes.

21:51.018 --> 21:52.352
It's about an affair, for sure.

21:52.477 --> 21:53.937
- Hold on tight.
- Yeah.

21:57.149 --> 22:00.319
Where are you going?
Once I catch you,

22:00.444 --> 22:03.655
I'll break your legs,
so you'll never be able to cheat on me.

22:19.004 --> 22:22.507
A nightclub? Really?

22:34.144 --> 22:34.978
Hi!

22:38.273 --> 22:40.275
No, you can't go in.

22:40.692 --> 22:41.985
Why not?

22:42.110 --> 22:44.488
That old man just went in.
Why can't I?

22:44.613 --> 22:46.573
What are you talking about?

22:46.698 --> 22:48.241
You should leave.

23:17.562 --> 23:19.189
I said no.

23:20.148 --> 23:22.192
I'm wearing the club outfit now.

23:22.317 --> 23:26.863
Get the hell out of here. Get out!

23:26.988 --> 23:29.741
Why can't I go in?

23:38.458 --> 23:41.294
That's what I mean. What is that?

23:59.938 --> 24:00.981
What now?

24:01.106 --> 24:04.025
Lots of cool guys tonight.
I'll hook you up. Let's go!

24:04.526 --> 24:06.862
- Let me go!
- They're really cool guys!

24:06.987 --> 24:10.407
Come quick!

24:11.908 --> 24:13.702
Hey, where are you going?

24:13.952 --> 24:15.078
Where are you going? Come here!

24:20.792 --> 24:21.668
What the hell?

24:21.793 --> 24:26.423
She's an old lady!
What did you tell me about that waiter?

24:26.715 --> 24:28.175
Hey, you!

24:28.300 --> 24:30.969
- Huh?
- Are you--

24:32.512 --> 24:34.181
Get up! That's Jun's mother!

24:35.807 --> 24:37.100
Nice to see you.

24:37.225 --> 24:40.896
- Oh, you are Jun's friends.
- Yes.

24:41.021 --> 24:45.984
- That's a really nice jacket!
- Yeah, thanks.

24:46.109 --> 24:47.444
What are you--

24:47.569 --> 24:50.238
Have you seen Jun's father?

24:50.363 --> 24:52.532
I saw him going in here, for sure.

24:52.657 --> 24:54.951
You mean Jun's dad, not Jun?

24:55.076 --> 24:56.912
I must be here.

24:57.037 --> 24:59.456
When you see him,
let me know right away.

24:59.581 --> 25:01.082
- Got it?
- Yes, ma'am.

25:02.334 --> 25:05.170
- Bye now.
- Good night.

25:09.299 --> 25:10.175
Oh, Jesus Christ!

25:24.648 --> 25:28.026
The dance competition begins now!

25:28.360 --> 25:32.113
Oh, the first participant
is already on the stage!

25:37.869 --> 25:41.623
The prize is a department gift card

25:41.748 --> 25:43.583
worth $250!

25:43.959 --> 25:45.335
$250!

25:46.586 --> 25:48.088
Start the music!

25:48.213 --> 25:49.464
DANCE COMPETITION

26:08.608 --> 26:12.612
What am I doing?
My body's moving on its own.

26:12.737 --> 26:17.117
It's been a long time,
but my body still remembers.

26:50.525 --> 26:51.818
- Yeah!
- Where are you going?

26:51.943 --> 26:55.447
Where are you going?
Don't go! Don't go!

26:55.572 --> 26:57.282
I know a good place.

27:02.829 --> 27:09.169
HOTEL

27:16.259 --> 27:19.054
I often come to this hotel restaurant.

27:19.179 --> 27:21.431
This is the only place you can have
sausage soup at this hour.

27:21.556 --> 27:24.267
What are you thinking?
No ox blood in the soup.

27:27.020 --> 27:29.731
Oh, shit!

27:35.820 --> 27:36.946
Hello.

27:37.072 --> 27:39.074
I can't stand it anymore.

27:39.199 --> 27:40.742
Do you call yourself a human being?

27:40.867 --> 27:43.286
What are you talking about?

27:43.411 --> 27:46.664
Tell me the truth. I've seen it all.

27:47.624 --> 27:51.044
Oh, what a surprise, huh?

27:51.169 --> 27:56.049
I know everything. I can smell it.

27:58.510 --> 28:01.846
- Oh, shit!
- You stink! I want a divorce now!

28:01.971 --> 28:05.392
This is no reason to get a divorce.

28:05.517 --> 28:06.810
What have I done wrong?

28:06.935 --> 28:09.938
What? You, nut job!
Are you out of your mind?

28:10.063 --> 28:13.358
- Where are you?
- At home, pooping.

28:13.483 --> 28:14.943
Pooping?

28:15.068 --> 28:16.569
What the shit!

28:16.694 --> 28:18.530
Send me proof!

28:18.655 --> 28:21.199
If you can't, we're getting a divorce!

28:21.324 --> 28:22.909
What?

28:45.098 --> 28:49.018
AN UNEXPECTED REASON FOR DIVORCE

29:06.327 --> 29:12.542
Cheol-wang,
I'm not going to live like this anymore.

29:13.960 --> 29:17.797
- Hi.
- Hi.

29:20.216 --> 29:21.301
Welcome!

29:31.978 --> 29:33.563
That day, I realized..

29:33.688 --> 29:36.691
I said goodbye to the time of my life,
I got married,

29:36.816 --> 29:40.028
and devoted myself
to being a wife and mother.

29:40.153 --> 29:42.071
But I lost myself.

29:42.489 --> 29:45.617
If all the people

29:45.742 --> 29:49.287
who remember me

29:50.622 --> 29:53.833
are sound asleep

29:53.958 --> 29:57.587
tonight

29:58.838 --> 30:03.051
Then the night is too long

30:03.802 --> 30:06.846
I used to be the Queen of Night
in the 1980s.

30:06.971 --> 30:08.765
I wanna see the morning

30:08.890 --> 30:10.475
I'm Jeong-kwon Kwon.
