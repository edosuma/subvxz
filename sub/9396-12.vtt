<i>Previously on</i> One Tree Hill:

00:04.337 --> 00:07.465
-You're Nathan, right?
-Yeah, do I know you?

00:07.774 --> 00:09.605
You should. I'm your sister-in-law.

00:09.809 --> 00:13.006
Dude, the thing is when I saw her,
I got that deja vu thing.

00:13.346 --> 00:17.077
-You probably saw her around school.
-She was the first girl I had sex with.

00:17.350 --> 00:19.648
Nice work, Jules. Just like we planned.

00:20.086 --> 00:21.747
What did Dan ask you to do?

00:22.522 --> 00:24.990
Make Keith fall in love with me...

00:26.292 --> 00:27.623
then break his heart.

00:27.927 --> 00:30.521
Dan's heart condition, is it genetic?

00:30.897 --> 00:33.195
-Yes.
-You are taking that test.

00:33.299 --> 00:35.665
There were these rumors that got started.

00:35.769 --> 00:37.794
But the thing is they were true.

00:38.238 --> 00:40.706
-What were the rumors?
-That I like girls.

00:41.307 --> 00:43.104
I won't say anything.

00:46.046 --> 00:47.172
I can't do this.

00:47.614 --> 00:49.241
You're not ready.

00:51.000 --> 00:57.074

01:49.109 --> 01:50.337
Mom, what's going on?

01:50.410 --> 01:53.504
You want to live in my house,
against my rules?

01:53.713 --> 01:57.308
You're sure as hell not going
to be comfortable doing it.

01:58.251 --> 01:59.775
The heart test?

02:01.754 --> 02:03.688
I'm sorry, Mom. But this is my life.

02:04.424 --> 02:08.723
If I'd been that selfish at your age,
you might not be here right now.

02:10.363 --> 02:12.422
You can't make me take this test, Mom.

02:13.566 --> 02:16.126
-Yeah. We'll see about that.
-Mom!

02:20.940 --> 02:22.430
You seem like a decent kid.

02:22.842 --> 02:25.470
But most of the applicants
at Carl's Crab Shack...

02:25.845 --> 02:28.143
have some work experience.

02:28.214 --> 02:30.011
Okay, fair enough.

02:30.083 --> 02:32.608
But I make up for my lack of experience
in other ways.

02:32.685 --> 02:36.587
I'm really good with people.
I mean, my friends really like me.

02:36.656 --> 02:39.454
And I know my crustaceans.
Lobsters, crabs, shrimp...

02:39.526 --> 02:40.925
they're all very tasty.

02:41.161 --> 02:43.152
Okay. Now, I have your number.

02:43.463 --> 02:47.900
Look, Mr. Crab Shack Carl, I need this job.

02:48.935 --> 02:51.699
My car insurance is due. I am on my own.

02:51.804 --> 02:54.295
And I cannot lose
my mode of transportation.

02:56.843 --> 02:59.505
Okay. I'm gonna give you a chance.
You can start today.

02:59.646 --> 03:00.670
Okay.

03:00.747 --> 03:02.578
But I don't have any waitress slots open.

03:02.649 --> 03:05.174
This is more of a PR job.

03:05.919 --> 03:08.786
PR is perfect for me.

03:11.391 --> 03:14.360
Come get the crabs at Carl's Crab Shack.

03:15.562 --> 03:19.259
Crab cakes, crab steaks
and creamy crab shakes.

03:21.201 --> 03:23.931
Come get the crabs at Carl's Crab Shack.

03:34.113 --> 03:37.412
If you came by for a game, Lucas,
you know I can't let you play.

03:38.051 --> 03:39.541
What are you doing to Keith?

03:39.619 --> 03:42.087
You mean Keith Scott,
the new VP at Dan Scott Motors?

03:42.155 --> 03:44.020
Company-car,
six-figure-salary Keith Scott?

03:44.090 --> 03:45.216
With Jules.

03:47.460 --> 03:49.485
She told me everything. Don't deny it.

03:53.666 --> 03:56.134
And I wanted to believe
that you'd somehow changed.

03:57.870 --> 03:59.132
Keith slept with Deb.

04:03.676 --> 04:06.804
What kind of man
sleeps with his brother's wife?

04:06.913 --> 04:09.473
-You're lying.
-Am I? Ask him.

04:11.651 --> 04:14.779
The night I walked in on them
was the night I had my heart attack.

04:15.655 --> 04:18.249
And I wanted revenge.
Just like any man would.

04:18.324 --> 04:20.485
But after a few weeks,
I came to my senses.

04:20.927 --> 04:24.192
I couldn't do that to my own brother,
no matter what he did to me.

04:24.264 --> 04:27.028
That's why I gave him the job. Out of guilt.

04:27.100 --> 04:29.295
And I told Jules to leave town quietly.

04:29.769 --> 04:32.863
-Why should I believe anything you say?
-Because it's the truth.

04:33.206 --> 04:37.609
I don't know what she's still doing here.
Maybe she's seen his paycheck.

04:51.824 --> 04:52.848
Shut that off.

04:52.925 --> 04:56.019
Is this the infamous Chris?
He sounds sexy.

04:56.162 --> 04:59.097
Nathan is in the bedroom.
Do you want to start World War III?

05:02.602 --> 05:05.435
-Nice henna tattoo.
-It's not henna.

05:08.941 --> 05:10.602
It is real. 23?

05:10.743 --> 05:13.041
Is that how many tequila shots
it took you to do it?

05:13.112 --> 05:14.101
Stop it!

05:14.180 --> 05:16.273
Hey, what happened to the whole...

05:16.349 --> 05:19.318
''tattoos are for sluts and burn-outs''
sermon that you gave me?

05:19.419 --> 05:21.216
Twenty-three is Nathan's jersey number...

05:21.287 --> 05:24.154
and you permanently marked your body
with some random spider.

05:24.223 --> 05:26.714
The scorpion paralyzes its victims.

05:26.826 --> 05:28.885
Nothing random about that.

05:29.028 --> 05:30.017
Yeah, I bet.

05:31.064 --> 05:32.691
You got a tattoo.

05:32.999 --> 05:37.026
And conveniently
it's in the exact same spot as me.

05:37.537 --> 05:40.665
I guess you don't disapprove
of your older sister so much after all.

05:40.740 --> 05:42.674
Don't flatter yourself.

05:44.010 --> 05:47.104
Does this mean you didn't wait for the ring
to give it up, either?

05:47.180 --> 05:49.410
I waited until I was in love.

05:51.351 --> 05:52.750
How about you, Nathan?

05:52.819 --> 05:54.719
Were you in love
the first time you had sex?

05:54.787 --> 05:55.913
-Tay!
-What?

05:55.988 --> 05:58.889
We're family now.
We shouldn't have secrets.

06:02.895 --> 06:05.159
It's not really any of your business.

06:05.231 --> 06:10.168
But the truth is whoever my first was
wasn't nearly as important as my last.

06:13.973 --> 06:15.304
Thank you.

06:31.491 --> 06:34.187
You're sure that my staying here
isn't an imposition?

06:34.260 --> 06:37.024
Of course not. We've got plenty of room.

06:37.196 --> 06:41.656
The last time I had my hardwood floors
refinished, it took almost a week.

06:44.203 --> 06:46.137
-Hey, Lucas.
-Hey, Andy.

06:47.006 --> 06:49.236
Okay, if you need anything...

06:49.342 --> 06:52.505
you know, stereo, PlayStation,
clean underwear...

06:54.580 --> 06:55.774
check the garage.

06:56.883 --> 06:58.441
Thanks, I will.

07:09.762 --> 07:10.956
Stupid little kids.

07:11.030 --> 07:14.431
One of them poured a soda down my hole,
and now I'm all sticky.

07:14.500 --> 07:16.024
Honey, that's nothing.

07:16.102 --> 07:19.196
One time a gang of eight-year-olds
pushed me into the fountain.

07:19.272 --> 07:21.740
They wanted to watch the lobster swim.

07:21.808 --> 07:23.605
-I'm Marla.
-I'm Brooke.

07:23.676 --> 07:25.871
And you are so not a lobster.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.409
-Hi.
-Hi.

07:31.517 --> 07:34.281
Yeah. So how long have you been
doing this?

07:34.353 --> 07:35.411
Six weeks.

07:35.488 --> 07:39.254
I used to be a giant beaver down at the
lumberyard, so at least I'm moving up.

07:39.358 --> 07:42.452
It's a sucky job,
but I really need the money, so....

07:42.562 --> 07:43.654
Tell me about it.

07:43.830 --> 07:46.765
...13, 14, 15.

07:47.266 --> 07:48.631
That's it?

07:49.635 --> 07:54.197
The six most humiliating hours of my life,
and I made $15?

07:54.373 --> 07:57.900
I deducted the usual fee
for costume rental and dry cleaning.

07:58.678 --> 08:02.079
That is a total racket.
We bust our butts out there all day.

08:02.215 --> 08:04.911
I have a blister from this thing, okay?

08:05.051 --> 08:06.746
We should be getting hazard pay.

08:06.886 --> 08:09.480
Any of you other crabs feel this way?

08:13.192 --> 08:15.922
If you don't like it, I guess it's...

08:16.529 --> 08:20.021
goodbye car insurance, hello city bus.

08:32.979 --> 08:34.173
Thanks.

08:34.780 --> 08:37.908
Dan Scott looking for recipes?

08:38.484 --> 08:41.078
I have officially seen everything.

08:42.188 --> 08:44.952
I was thinking of inviting Keith
and his girlfriend for dinner.

08:45.024 --> 08:47.492
They're getting serious.
Time she met the family.

08:47.627 --> 08:51.085
-Wouldn't that be a little awkward?
-Why should it be?

08:51.264 --> 08:55.132
You and Karen both slept with me and
you still figured out a way to be friends.

08:55.668 --> 08:56.862
That's what I mean.

08:56.969 --> 08:58.664
She seems like such a nice person...

08:58.738 --> 09:01.639
one night with our crazy family,
she might skip town.

09:01.741 --> 09:03.368
I don't think so.

09:05.244 --> 09:09.943
And this isn't just another opportunity
for you to rip Keith apart?

09:10.082 --> 09:12.880
It isn't. Promise.

09:15.288 --> 09:16.915
I'll call Keith and set it up.

09:35.908 --> 09:37.102
Hello.

09:37.877 --> 09:39.777
<i>Hey, it's me, what are you doing?</i>

09:40.446 --> 09:43.540
Nothing. Just thinking of you.

09:53.259 --> 09:55.625
So Keith slept with Nathan's mom?

09:56.629 --> 09:58.119
I don't know.

09:58.998 --> 10:00.829
Can't really trust what Dan said.

10:01.067 --> 10:03.797
But you know Jules and Dan set Keith up.

10:04.537 --> 10:05.902
Are you gonna tell him?

10:06.973 --> 10:09.942
If I don't, I'm basically lying to my uncle.

10:11.544 --> 10:14.206
And, if you do, it'll crush him.

10:15.514 --> 10:18.381
Yeah. And I just can't believe Jules.

10:19.719 --> 10:21.482
I mean, she says she loves Keith.

10:22.688 --> 10:25.452
But what kind of a person
would do something like this...

10:25.524 --> 10:27.082
in the first place, you know?

10:27.493 --> 10:30.894
Maybe Jules was a bad person
when she went into it...

10:30.963 --> 10:33.693
but now her feelings for Keith are real.

10:35.034 --> 10:37.298
Or maybe it's all just part of the lie.

10:39.071 --> 10:43.269
Thank you,
for talking to me about this, Anna.

10:43.442 --> 10:47.503
It feels good to have at least one person
in my life that knows the truth.

10:49.248 --> 10:50.647
You're that person for me.

10:52.151 --> 10:55.120
AIthough there is one other person
who knows.

10:55.388 --> 10:56.548
Felix?

10:57.323 --> 10:59.553
Not hardly. Peyton.

11:00.059 --> 11:01.890
-You told Peyton?
-No.

11:02.461 --> 11:04.952
But she kind of found out when...

11:06.132 --> 11:07.861
I kind of kissed her.

11:10.302 --> 11:12.532
-Luke.
-Hold on.

11:14.407 --> 11:17.501
-I'm picturing that.
-Okay. Don't be such a guy.

11:17.810 --> 11:20.938
It was only the single most embarrassing
moment of my life.

11:21.013 --> 11:22.037
Sorry.

11:23.049 --> 11:27.008
Let's just say it didn't end well,
and now she's avoiding me.

11:27.286 --> 11:29.277
No, it's not that at all.

11:29.522 --> 11:31.956
She just took a little road trip.

11:32.625 --> 11:34.752
She only told me and Brooke.

11:35.995 --> 11:38.156
-What?
-No, it's just kind of funny.

11:38.631 --> 11:41.429
The last time I kissed Peyton
it didn't end well, either.

11:51.677 --> 11:53.269
We have to talk.

11:54.747 --> 11:56.271
You didn't call me back.

11:59.018 --> 12:01.646
-So are we still on for tomorrow night?
-Definitely.

12:01.721 --> 12:04.349
That's good because I just got a call.

12:04.457 --> 12:07.654
We're invited to dinner
at my brother Dan's house.

12:18.270 --> 12:19.794
What the hell are you doing?

12:20.272 --> 12:24.675
Shopping. But apparently I'm the only
James who got the good-taste gene.

12:25.177 --> 12:26.872
You know what I'm talking about.

12:28.481 --> 12:31.109
We agreed to keep what happened
between us a secret.

12:31.183 --> 12:33.310
Relax, Nathan. Haley doesn't have a clue.

12:35.321 --> 12:37.516
I went out on a limb for you.

12:42.461 --> 12:45.988
I said you could stay here because
I knew you didn't have anywhere to go.

12:46.332 --> 12:49.699
And I really appreciate it.

12:50.636 --> 12:53.833
You keep this up,
I'll throw you out on your ass.

12:55.107 --> 12:57.439
Or maybe I should tell Haley
about our history.

12:59.211 --> 13:01.406
And then you'll be the one out on your ass.

13:16.929 --> 13:19.591
How would you like
a crab leg up your ass?

13:24.637 --> 13:28.198
Nice claws. I thought you said
you had a crappy new job?

13:28.374 --> 13:30.308
Why are you here, to make fun of me?

13:30.376 --> 13:33.573
No. I came to have lunch
and give my waitress girlfriend a big tip.

13:33.646 --> 13:36.444
Surprise! I'm not a waitress. I'm a crab.

13:37.049 --> 13:38.607
Trust me. That's no surprise.

13:39.118 --> 13:42.986
I applied everywhere, okay.
This was the only job I could get.

13:43.322 --> 13:44.846
At least I look good in red.

13:48.661 --> 13:50.185
Felix, come on.

13:51.163 --> 13:53.597
-No. Don't take a picture of me.
-Just one. Come on.

13:53.799 --> 13:55.289
Enough, okay?

13:55.467 --> 13:56.456
Stop.

13:57.102 --> 13:58.763
Snap to it, Crabitha!

14:00.306 --> 14:02.103
And no flirting with the sailors!

14:03.676 --> 14:04.938
Okay.

14:06.111 --> 14:08.944
Hey, Carl. I'm just curious.

14:09.348 --> 14:13.341
I've been at this for three hours,
so when do I get a break?

14:13.886 --> 14:17.014
State law says
I don't have to give you a break.

14:17.289 --> 14:19.849
A shark stops swimming, it'll drown.

14:19.992 --> 14:21.550
But I'm a crab.

14:21.694 --> 14:23.662
Whatever. It's all fish.

14:26.131 --> 14:27.758
I hate that guy!

14:27.833 --> 14:30.393
I don't know why any of the other crabs
put up with him.

14:30.469 --> 14:32.232
They probably need money like you.

14:32.304 --> 14:35.296
Otherwise, you could all band together
and pince him to death.

14:37.877 --> 14:40.641
-Luke. What's up?
-I need to talk to you.

14:40.913 --> 14:42.107
Is everything okay?

14:42.214 --> 14:44.842
Remember when we were in Charleston...

14:44.917 --> 14:47.681
and you said you'd done some things
you weren't proud of?

14:47.853 --> 14:48.911
Yeah.

14:49.788 --> 14:50.777
Was it Deb?

14:51.790 --> 14:53.189
You and Deb?

14:53.559 --> 14:54.753
It's...

14:57.029 --> 14:58.997
kind of complicated, Luke.

14:59.565 --> 15:01.123
No, not really.

15:02.001 --> 15:04.060
There's some lines you just don't cross.

15:04.370 --> 15:06.395
It was a mistake, I know.

15:06.739 --> 15:09.503
I know it's no excuse, but I was lonely.

15:09.675 --> 15:12.769
Your mom had just turned down
my proposal and...

15:12.845 --> 15:15.712
it just sort of happened.

15:15.881 --> 15:19.317
It's bad enough it was someone's wife,
but Dan's wife?

15:19.818 --> 15:23.879
-He's never gonna let that go!
-I know you're disappointed in me.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.421
I'm never gonna make a mistake
like that again.

15:26.592 --> 15:28.082
I'm with Jules now.

15:28.160 --> 15:31.152
And I'm not gonna do anything
to mess that up.

15:36.568 --> 15:39.298
So things are going well
with you and Jules?

15:39.571 --> 15:42.734
Yeah. I never thought I'd feel this way
again after your mom.

15:46.879 --> 15:48.278
But she's the one, Luke.

15:51.951 --> 15:54.886
I'm not proud of what I did with Deb, and...

15:56.155 --> 15:59.613
that's the only reason
that I kept it secret from you.

16:00.159 --> 16:02.286
You understand that, right?

16:05.731 --> 16:06.823
Sure.

16:24.083 --> 16:25.573
I've been to Turkey.

16:25.651 --> 16:28.176
They have prisons
more comfortable than this.

16:30.356 --> 16:32.756
Here. I swiped you some saltines.

16:34.994 --> 16:37.690
-Thank you.
-Just don't tell the warden.

16:38.831 --> 16:40.230
At least she's creative.

16:40.399 --> 16:42.765
Single moms are the toughest.
I guess they have to be.

16:42.835 --> 16:46.134
-I think I can outlast her.
-Or you could just take the test.

16:47.206 --> 16:48.571
I had to try.

16:49.475 --> 16:52.273
-You know she's just worried about you.
-Yeah, I know.

16:52.344 --> 16:55.438
But at a certain point she needs to
trust me to do the right thing.

16:55.748 --> 17:00.481
AII right.
Just, don't be too hard on your mom.

17:02.321 --> 17:04.811
Sometimes people do crazy things
when they're desperate.

17:05.624 --> 17:07.990
Family dinner was never
part of the arrangement.

17:08.060 --> 17:10.528
It was my wife's idea.
I couldn't talk her out of it.

17:10.596 --> 17:13.463
It's just a simple dinner.
Consider it overtime.

17:13.799 --> 17:15.960
I told you. I'm not doing this anymore.

17:16.667 --> 17:18.295
What Keith and I have is real.

17:18.369 --> 17:21.601
<i>lf that's the case, why don't you</i>
<i>come over to dinner and convince me?</i>

17:21.673 --> 17:23.641
Maybe we'll discuss a change of plans.

17:29.148 --> 17:33.141
I was thinking about asking Karen
if we could live here till Taylor's gone.

17:33.218 --> 17:35.778
Maybe put a mattress behind the counter
or something.

17:37.289 --> 17:38.688
We need to talk about her.

17:39.658 --> 17:41.091
I warned you about her.

17:41.193 --> 17:43.889
Give Taylor an inch
and she'll take whatever she wants.

17:43.962 --> 17:46.021
I know her a lot better than you do.

17:48.400 --> 17:50.061
AII right, Haley.

17:50.536 --> 17:52.527
We got married so quickly...

17:52.671 --> 17:57.108
we never really had the talk that
most people have when they get engaged.

17:59.011 --> 18:01.571
About past relationships...

18:02.815 --> 18:04.339
sexual history.

18:04.817 --> 18:07.945
That's probably because I can give you
mine in under 10 seconds...

18:08.020 --> 18:10.511
while yours is cataloged
in the Library of Congress.

18:12.825 --> 18:14.417
What's going on?

18:15.928 --> 18:16.917
AII right.

18:17.629 --> 18:21.326
My first time was at this party
at my parents' beach house.

18:22.401 --> 18:26.303
I was pretty wasted
and I never really saw the girl again.

18:27.706 --> 18:30.231
-Until now.
-Until now?

18:31.743 --> 18:36.203
Haley, I swear I hadn't even heard of you
when this happened.

18:36.281 --> 18:38.181
-Taylor.
-I'm sorry. I just....

18:38.851 --> 18:42.309
She threatened to tell you.
I just thought you should hear it from me.

18:42.688 --> 18:45.987
-You slept with my sister?
-This was, like, two years ago.

18:46.458 --> 18:50.394
I didn't know you. I didn't even know
there was gonna be a you.

18:52.464 --> 18:53.954
I should go.

18:55.067 --> 18:56.295
Haley....

19:36.074 --> 19:37.769
You're home early.

19:38.043 --> 19:39.476
You're home all the time.

19:40.479 --> 19:43.346
What are you doing on my laptop?
You cruising for jailbait?

19:43.415 --> 19:44.507
Excuse me?

19:45.117 --> 19:48.211
I heard your specialty
is deflowering freshmen.

19:49.521 --> 19:52.752
So the boy scout told you.
Quite a coincidence.

19:52.958 --> 19:55.984
Look at it this way,
now we can compare notes.

19:56.161 --> 19:59.927
-It's not funny, Taylor.
-Let go!

20:01.466 --> 20:05.061
If you wanted to find someone I haven't
slept with, you could've moved to Alaska.

20:05.137 --> 20:07.071
You know what?
Do you think my relationship...

20:07.139 --> 20:09.505
-with Nathan is just a big joke?
-No! Of course not.

20:10.909 --> 20:12.934
But I think that Chris is a laugh riot.

20:14.446 --> 20:15.572
What are you talking about?

20:15.647 --> 20:19.515
I'm talking about you bitching about your
husband's past when you have a present.

20:19.585 --> 20:22.247
I was online and I got an IM.
Or rather you did.

20:22.888 --> 20:24.947
-You've been kissing Chris.
-I don't...

20:25.891 --> 20:27.552
know what you're talking about.

20:27.759 --> 20:29.454
-Are you sleeping with him?
-No!

20:33.999 --> 20:36.934
-It's not what it looks like, okay.
-Really?

20:37.002 --> 20:40.494
Because it seems to me like
Saint Haley is just as bad as the rest of us.

20:43.108 --> 20:45.975
Taylor, Nathan cannot find out about this.

20:48.880 --> 20:52.281
Fine, Hay.
But you have to let me stay here.

20:52.351 --> 20:54.546
At least until I figure out what I'm doing.

21:08.567 --> 21:10.535
That costume is so sweaty.

21:11.036 --> 21:12.594
I have a rash all over my....

21:12.771 --> 21:14.398
Anyways, I've got a rash.

21:14.539 --> 21:17.201
I've got carpal tunnel
from snapping my pincers all day.

21:17.276 --> 21:20.439
Okay. You guys, we can stand around
in the break room...

21:20.512 --> 21:22.639
and complain and be crabby...

21:22.714 --> 21:25.581
or we can figure out a way to protect
ourselves from that guy.

21:25.651 --> 21:28.211
But if we want to change things,
we have to do it together.

21:28.287 --> 21:30.050
So you want to form a crab union?

21:30.289 --> 21:32.849
I'm thinking more along the lines
of a crab sorority.

21:32.958 --> 21:35.893
We make a list of our demands
and we take them to management.

21:36.061 --> 21:38.120
Okay. It's not a bad idea.

21:38.297 --> 21:41.289
But I've got a two-year-old at home.
I really need this job.

21:41.600 --> 21:44.228
Besides, I've seen Carl fire people
who make trouble.

21:44.303 --> 21:46.897
Okay. But what if I can find a way...

21:47.005 --> 21:49.974
to guarantee that none of us get fired?
Are you all on board?

21:51.443 --> 21:52.705
-Yeah.
-Yeah.

21:53.011 --> 21:54.672
-You guys?
-Yeah.

21:55.981 --> 21:57.073
Okay.

22:04.589 --> 22:05.783
What are you doing?

22:07.025 --> 22:09.755
Nothing. What's up?

22:10.862 --> 22:13.922
I didn't know how soon I'd see you again
after yesterday....

22:14.032 --> 22:15.522
Yeah, I know.

22:17.436 --> 22:21.304
I've been thinking about that a lot.
I came down pretty hard on you.

22:23.075 --> 22:25.566
You weren't the only one
running away to Charleston.

22:25.677 --> 22:28.908
Don't worry, you weren't
any harder on me than I was on myself.

22:29.614 --> 22:32.139
That's not what I want
to talk to you about.

22:32.217 --> 22:33.844
This HCM thing.

22:34.586 --> 22:37.680
I don't care what Mom told you.
I'm not taking the test.

22:37.756 --> 22:39.485
That's what I said.

22:40.726 --> 22:43.786
We've got the same genes, Luke.
I'm just as at risk as you are.

22:44.262 --> 22:47.925
I've been putting off the test, too.
You want to know why?

22:48.433 --> 22:49.593
Because I'm scared.

22:52.637 --> 22:55.572
-Yeah, me too.
-But I've decided I'm gonna take the test...

22:55.741 --> 22:57.538
if it'll give Jules peace of mind.

22:58.510 --> 23:00.205
Jules wants you to take the test?

23:00.312 --> 23:02.940
She's been bugging me about it
for three weeks.

23:03.014 --> 23:06.415
Just like your mom. That's what people do
if they care about you, Luke.

23:09.087 --> 23:12.454
How about we go together? Not for us.

23:13.325 --> 23:14.622
For them.

23:16.628 --> 23:18.027
Just give it some thought.

23:20.432 --> 23:24.027
-Okay. I gotta get going.
-Keith.

23:27.239 --> 23:29.799
-Thank you for being here for me.
-AIways.

23:29.875 --> 23:33.140
I just want you to know
that I'm here for you, too.

23:33.445 --> 23:34.844
No matter what happens.

23:35.013 --> 23:38.881
Don't' worry about the test, Luke.
Everything's gonna be okay.

23:51.530 --> 23:55.523
Don't worry. You don't have to throw
the ball in the river. I'm just here to watch.

24:00.005 --> 24:02.337
-What's going on with you?
-It's a long story.

24:02.874 --> 24:05.069
Actually, it's not a long story.

24:06.244 --> 24:08.508
I kind of told Haley that I slept with Taylor.

24:10.048 --> 24:13.313
Wow. I guess I'm not the only one
who doesn't want to go home.

24:17.956 --> 24:19.821
You know, I've been thinking lately.

24:19.958 --> 24:23.792
Maybe it's okay to lie
if you're doing it to protect somebody.

24:24.563 --> 24:25.928
Now you tell me.

24:27.065 --> 24:28.191
I mean, look.

24:28.366 --> 24:32.029
When you got together with Haley,
you were doing it to screw with me, right?

24:32.537 --> 24:34.835
Yeah. Pretty much.

24:35.941 --> 24:38.375
But, when she found out...

24:40.445 --> 24:43.380
-she was able to forgive you.
-Yeah, but that's all Haley.

24:44.583 --> 24:46.016
Why? What'd you do wrong?

24:46.952 --> 24:50.513
Nothing really.
At least I didn't sleep with Taylor.

24:53.692 --> 24:56.525
I better go home
and try to get Haley to forgive me again.

24:57.929 --> 24:59.021
AII right, man.

25:18.750 --> 25:20.240
Am I in the right apartment?

25:20.685 --> 25:22.778
Where's that nasty incense smell?

25:22.921 --> 25:25.048
Taylor went out for a jog.

25:27.459 --> 25:29.620
Does this mean
you're talking to me again?

25:30.495 --> 25:32.520
I'm really sorry, Nathan.

25:33.265 --> 25:34.789
I overreacted.

25:36.134 --> 25:38.898
What happened with you and Taylor
was a long time ago...

25:38.970 --> 25:41.200
and I don't have any right to be angry.

25:44.042 --> 25:45.634
I am in the wrong apartment.

25:49.114 --> 25:50.103
Besides...

25:50.982 --> 25:54.543
the things we did in the past
don't mean anything, right?

25:55.387 --> 25:57.082
You don't have to worry anymore.

25:58.089 --> 26:02.150
I went through your family album
and I haven't slept with your other sisters.

26:03.395 --> 26:04.487
Listen, Haley.

26:07.065 --> 26:08.498
I don't want to hurt you.

26:08.934 --> 26:13.200
I don't want to lie to you, either.
I know how honest you are with me.

26:23.848 --> 26:26.373
Keith. Promise me we can talk later.

26:26.952 --> 26:30.388
We'll have dinner first.
Then we'll see if you're still talking to me.

26:33.425 --> 26:35.552
Danny. This is Jules.

26:36.328 --> 26:38.489
Jules, this is my brother Dan.

26:39.297 --> 26:41.265
Nice to meet you, Jules. Come on in.

26:57.515 --> 26:59.176
-Here you go.
-So, Jules...

26:59.784 --> 27:03.117
how does someone like you end up
with someone like my brother?

27:03.355 --> 27:04.788
Just good luck, I guess.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.788
It's gotta be more than that.

27:08.960 --> 27:12.054
-What's your story? Where are you from?
-Texas.

27:12.864 --> 27:15.128
I thought you said you were
from the Midwest.

27:16.601 --> 27:19.331
We're from all over, really. Army brat.

27:22.107 --> 27:23.938
Deb, this chicken is fantastic.

27:24.075 --> 27:27.169
And I'm not just saying that
because you're kind of my boss.

27:27.278 --> 27:29.906
Thanks. But, actually, Dan made dinner.

27:32.517 --> 27:33.745
You okay?

27:33.952 --> 27:34.941
Yeah.

27:35.987 --> 27:38.285
How are things going down at the club?

27:38.356 --> 27:40.950
-Great. We've been really busy.
-Good.

27:43.028 --> 27:44.825
Keith, you're dating a bartender.

27:45.030 --> 27:47.965
It's like a dream come true for you, boozy?

27:48.166 --> 27:49.861
Must be fascinating work, though.

27:50.001 --> 27:53.732
You get to hear everyone's dirty secrets.
We all have them.

27:56.541 --> 27:59.203
I guess every bartender
has to be part therapist.

27:59.277 --> 28:01.040
Sure. But it's got to be tough.

28:01.112 --> 28:03.171
Pretending to care
about the poor bastards.

28:03.248 --> 28:05.216
I don't have to pretend.

28:08.653 --> 28:10.211
Deb, you did a...

28:11.056 --> 28:14.253
-beautiful job. The table looks just great.
-Thanks, Keith.

28:17.762 --> 28:19.389
You know, Jules.

28:19.564 --> 28:22.362
Deb and Keith
have always been very close.

28:22.534 --> 28:24.434
They have a very special relationship.

28:24.536 --> 28:27.699
Not just in-laws. More loving.

28:28.606 --> 28:31.006
Hopefully, you and I can
carry on the tradition.

28:31.109 --> 28:33.976
Dan, put it away and help me with dessert.

28:34.546 --> 28:35.979
Sure. But first a toast.

28:38.516 --> 28:40.245
To Jules and Keith.

28:40.618 --> 28:42.176
And to honesty.

28:44.055 --> 28:46.922
The foundation of every good relationship.

28:57.235 --> 28:58.566
Look at these people.

28:58.970 --> 29:01.803
They all know what they want
and they manage to find it.

29:02.974 --> 29:04.908
Makes me kind of jealous.

29:06.978 --> 29:08.502
Okay, maybe not of them.

29:10.248 --> 29:12.478
You probably think I'm weird.

29:13.184 --> 29:16.415
Yeah. But I've thought that
since I first met you.

29:17.088 --> 29:18.419
It's just that...

29:20.258 --> 29:22.624
you like girls or you like guys.

29:24.696 --> 29:26.891
Trust me. I wish it was like that for me.

29:27.932 --> 29:30.298
It would be a lot easier
if I could just pick a team.

29:30.368 --> 29:31.494
Not necessarily.

29:32.570 --> 29:36.404
Maybe you shouldn't feel so much
pressure to define yourself.

29:38.476 --> 29:41.604
So, are you gonna take
this HCM test, or what?

29:43.648 --> 29:45.081
Your mom tracked me down.

29:45.483 --> 29:49.078
Look, Luke, for selfish reasons,
I think you should.

29:49.454 --> 29:52.321
As far as friends go, you're all I've got.

29:52.624 --> 29:54.023
I can't risk losing you.

29:57.262 --> 30:00.356
What if it was your mom
that was supposed to take this test?

30:01.065 --> 30:02.657
She's the only mom you've got.

30:03.535 --> 30:06.299
Would you let her take that for granted?

30:15.013 --> 30:16.742
No, I do not have time right now.

30:16.815 --> 30:20.376
Just because we're dating does not mean
you get a sexual season pass.

30:20.451 --> 30:21.577
What's going on?

30:21.653 --> 30:24.713
I promised the other crabs I'd find a way
to make things better at work...

30:24.789 --> 30:27.553
so I'm gonna look up dirt on this Carl guy.

30:27.625 --> 30:30.321
That, or you could go after him legally.

30:31.062 --> 30:32.256
How do you mean?

30:32.330 --> 30:34.525
Try looking
on the state employment website.

30:34.799 --> 30:38.496
A guy like that is bound to be breaking
some kind of small-business law.

30:39.204 --> 30:41.570
I'll get us some coffee.
We can work all night.

30:42.173 --> 30:44.004
You're gonna help me?

30:44.075 --> 30:46.134
Of course, Brooke. You're my girlfriend.

30:48.313 --> 30:49.541
Thanks.

30:50.114 --> 30:52.742
Besides, I have to
if we're ever gonna have sex again.

30:55.820 --> 30:57.219
Just kidding.

31:06.898 --> 31:10.459
Those trophies are all for first place.
Except that one.

31:12.170 --> 31:13.228
Second place.

31:14.739 --> 31:16.502
My junior year against Mt. Pilot.

31:17.208 --> 31:18.903
We would have won the game, too.

31:19.244 --> 31:21.974
Except the team tried to change
the offense in mid-play.

31:26.384 --> 31:28.409
Is that what this dinner was all about?

31:29.554 --> 31:32.614
The dinner was to remind you
who you're working for. I pay you.

31:32.891 --> 31:36.156
I give you a place to live.
In exchange, you do exactly what I say.

31:36.594 --> 31:38.926
I don't want to do this anymore.

31:39.931 --> 31:41.421
I love Keith.

31:45.336 --> 31:47.463
You know,
I'm as romantic as the next guy.

31:47.538 --> 31:50.598
Ordinarily, I'd let you guys ride off
into the sunset together.

31:52.777 --> 31:54.768
-But you told my son.
-He found out.

31:54.879 --> 31:56.676
From now on, you leave Lucas to me.

31:56.881 --> 31:59.111
Your only job is to finish what we started.

32:00.184 --> 32:01.742
Come on, Jules.

32:02.120 --> 32:05.783
It would be different if you were gonna
spend the rest of your life with him.

32:07.392 --> 32:10.725
But do you really think Keith
would forgive you if he knew the truth?

32:23.675 --> 32:24.972
Sorry about your hair.

32:26.077 --> 32:27.942
I'm sorry I slept with your husband.

32:28.846 --> 32:31.406
If it's any consolation,
I'm not that memorable.

32:31.916 --> 32:33.679
Okay, that's a lie.

32:36.020 --> 32:38.921
-What am I gonna do, Taylor?
-Hang in there.

32:39.023 --> 32:42.220
-Eventually, he'll forget about me.
-I'm serious.

32:44.595 --> 32:47.689
I love Nathan.
And this is all really confusing.

32:50.435 --> 32:52.699
-Because you kissed Chris?
-No.

32:54.439 --> 32:57.499
Because I'm just jealous of what Chris has.

32:58.476 --> 33:01.934
You know, his music,
the freedom to pursue his dream.

33:02.613 --> 33:05.582
And that kiss just made it a lot messier.

33:10.154 --> 33:11.815
I really don't know what to do.

33:14.559 --> 33:16.151
I am...

33:17.562 --> 33:19.723
the wrong girl to ask for advice.

33:21.699 --> 33:23.894
You want to know why
I really got the tattoo?

33:25.036 --> 33:28.563
When a scorpion's caught in a fire,
it stings itself to death.

33:30.008 --> 33:31.441
That's a myth, actually.

33:32.310 --> 33:33.868
Not in my life.

33:35.513 --> 33:39.244
When things get bad,
I always find a way to make them worse.

33:50.228 --> 33:51.456
The truth is, Hay...

33:52.697 --> 33:54.665
you've always been miles ahead of me.

33:56.768 --> 33:59.134
Most of the time I feel like the little sister.

34:03.074 --> 34:05.702
You'll do the right thing, Haley-Bob.

34:06.677 --> 34:07.837
You always do.

34:22.060 --> 34:24.551
Luke. What are you doing here?

34:24.695 --> 34:27.357
I just wanted to see how you're doing.

34:27.697 --> 34:30.996
Actually, I'm glad you stopped by.

34:31.636 --> 34:34.366
Something happened tonight. With Jules.

34:43.047 --> 34:45.038
I asked her to marry me.

34:50.121 --> 34:52.954
Hey, don't look so worried. She said yes.

34:57.061 --> 34:58.289
That's great.

35:06.437 --> 35:09.065
What are you standing around here for?

35:09.807 --> 35:11.468
Get back to work!

35:12.710 --> 35:16.111
We will. As soon as you agree
to our list of demands.

35:16.280 --> 35:17.577
Demands? What is this?

35:17.782 --> 35:19.340
I've been doing some research.

35:19.417 --> 35:23.979
It turns out that uniform maintenance
can't be deducted from our hourly wages.

35:24.422 --> 35:28.483
And these crab suits are not flame
retardant, which is a violation of OSHA.

35:28.626 --> 35:30.253
-OSHA?
-Trust me.

35:30.328 --> 35:32.694
And there is plenty more
where that came from.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.357
We are not singing our crabby songs
until you comply.

35:37.268 --> 35:39.202
Okay, you win.

35:39.670 --> 35:42.571
Turn in your crabby suits! You're all fired!

35:43.007 --> 35:47.034
I can snap my fingers
and get crabs whenever I want to.

35:48.179 --> 35:51.376
Okay. Girls. There you go.

35:51.782 --> 35:55.548
That's for you. For you.

35:56.020 --> 35:57.510
What the hell is this?

35:57.688 --> 36:00.782
Since you've fired us,
you've given us plenty of time to picket.

36:01.325 --> 36:03.589
What do the signs say?

36:03.728 --> 36:06.492
Nothing your entire crab staff
doesn't already know.

36:06.831 --> 36:10.164
That your so-called fresh crabs
aren't fresh at all.

36:10.635 --> 36:13.263
They're frozen. Now girls.

36:14.438 --> 36:15.996
-That's a lie.
-Really?

36:16.073 --> 36:18.906
There's supposed to be flown in daily
from Alaska.

36:19.010 --> 36:21.638
They come in on a truck from Jersey.

36:21.879 --> 36:24.746
-Listen, you can't prove any of it.
-Really?

36:24.815 --> 36:27.215
In the case of Carl's famous crab bisque...

36:27.451 --> 36:29.351
you use imitation crab.

36:33.024 --> 36:34.150
Negotiate.

36:34.625 --> 36:36.957
A dollar more per hour per crab.

36:39.630 --> 36:40.927
AII right, fine.

36:40.998 --> 36:43.398
-Two 15-minute breaks.
-One.

36:43.501 --> 36:46.163
-Mars, did I say two 20-minute breaks?
-Yes.

36:47.138 --> 36:49.868
You said 15. AII right. Two.

36:50.107 --> 36:52.268
Get rid of the signs and you've got a deal.

36:55.613 --> 36:56.671
Damn crabs.

37:03.187 --> 37:04.449
How'd it go?

37:05.189 --> 37:06.315
We won!

37:08.492 --> 37:11.120
What's gonna be your first act
as an organized crab?

37:11.229 --> 37:12.856
Actually, I quit.

37:13.231 --> 37:14.289
-Seriously?
-Yeah.

37:14.732 --> 37:16.290
I put in my two-weeks notice.

37:16.367 --> 37:18.801
By then I'll have enough money
to pay my car insurance.

37:18.869 --> 37:21.429
As it turns out,
I'm not so big on the working thing.

37:22.773 --> 37:25.970
It felt really good to do something nice
for the little guy though.

37:26.844 --> 37:28.277
You must be pretty tired.

37:28.346 --> 37:30.644
How about you get some rest,
and I'll come by later?

37:30.715 --> 37:33.980
How about you get some rest
with me now, boyfriend?

37:39.023 --> 37:41.617
So what do you think about
your uncle being engaged?

37:41.692 --> 37:43.626
Honestly, I think it's a little fast.

37:46.330 --> 37:48.355
You know, this HCM thing.

37:49.000 --> 37:51.764
It reminded me that every day
might be the last, and...

37:52.737 --> 37:55.262
I want to live them all with Jules.

37:55.940 --> 37:58.932
I know,
but what do you really know about her?

38:00.344 --> 38:02.312
I know you wanted me
to marry your mom.

38:02.947 --> 38:05.745
But life doesn't always work
according to plan.

38:05.983 --> 38:09.248
I had to move on.
I don't want to miss a second chance.

38:10.087 --> 38:12.817
Trust me, once you get to know Jules...

38:13.024 --> 38:15.959
you're gonna love her just as much as I do.

38:17.328 --> 38:19.296
I'm glad you're taking the test, Luke.

38:21.399 --> 38:23.196
Like you said, for my mom, right?

38:24.735 --> 38:27.397
Before we go in,
there's something I want to ask you.

38:27.872 --> 38:30.340
I know this whole thing is still sinking in...

38:30.408 --> 38:33.844
but it would mean a lot to me
if you'd be my best man.

38:36.747 --> 38:39.409
-Sure.
-AII right.

40:34.432 --> 40:35.490
Mom.

40:38.536 --> 40:40.299
I don't agree with your decision.

40:41.839 --> 40:43.067
I don't understand.

40:44.675 --> 40:45.972
And I'm not going to.

40:51.649 --> 40:53.241
I took the test.

40:56.687 --> 40:58.450
We'll know in a couple of days.

41:00.090 --> 41:01.614
Thank you.

42:03.020 --> 42:04.112
What do you want?

42:04.188 --> 42:07.021
You and I are the only ones who know
the truth about Jules.

42:07.091 --> 42:10.060
And I'm willing to keep it a secret.
Keith never has to know.

42:12.963 --> 42:14.988
What do you want from me?

42:20.571 --> 42:22.402
I'm sure we can work something out.

43:14.858 --> 43:15.847
English
