01:59.419 --> 02:00.477
Fear him!

02:03.389 --> 02:04.321
Arrows!

02:08.294 --> 02:09.261
Arrow!

02:31.351 --> 02:38.257
I am by king's order,
here to meet Jend.Long.

02:40.260 --> 02:46.392
Is this how to treat a messenger?

02:46.499 --> 02:48.399
Ask her identity

02:55.375 --> 02:59.436
Who are you, quickly say!

02:59.546 --> 03:05.246
I'm the official Joseon ..

03:14.360 --> 03:18.296
Come back. Do not catch a cold

03:31.444 --> 03:34.436
Last night, crossing the river from here?

03:34.547 --> 03:40.281
Yes. I show you the way

03:40.353 --> 03:45.290
Soon, Qing's army is coming.
Why do not you run away?

03:45.425 --> 03:50.488
Though they are cruel, but it will
not complicate the helpless old man

03:53.433 --> 03:57.460
I really know this ice way

03:58.271 --> 04:04.403
When Qing's army comes, I'll
show you the way, eat in return

04:06.412 --> 04:16.481
You are the people of Joseon. Why did yesterday
help the king, tomorrow help Qing's army?

04:17.423 --> 04:24.329
I help you across the river,
but I can not do anything

04:35.475 --> 04:43.280
I want to go to Nan Nan City.
There will repay your mind

04:43.383 --> 04:49.379
I still have to take care of my grandson

04:49.455 --> 04:58.261
That kid by the river? - Yeah.
Her parents are dead

04:59.265 --> 05:03.258
I'm the only one of his family
/ I'll take care of the kid

05:03.536 --> 05:11.238
We go together / Not far from here.
Please go

05:11.344 --> 05:15.440
Although a bit difficult,
but the west door closer

05:15.515 --> 05:20.509
I will definitely take care of you and your grandson.
Really do not want to go with me?

05:22.555 --> 05:29.427
I... better go back to my place.

07:03.256 --> 07:08.284
I heard the king is here too.
It seems to be a long time here

07:09.295 --> 07:12.355
But these goods... can it really be for war?

07:15.268 --> 07:16.326
The sun is almost set

07:16.436 --> 07:20.270
No one brought food

07:22.542 --> 07:27.241
Do we also have to get out of here?

07:27.513 --> 07:32.473
I heard some have run away.

07:33.286 --> 07:34.480
Where can I go from here?

07:37.390 --> 07:41.224
We were here to hide
from the bandits.

07:43.329 --> 07:49.268
I understand. But staying here,
will be involved in the war.

07:49.335 --> 07:53.465
Though dead, also die here

07:54.474 --> 07:58.342
If you want to go, pack your things

07:59.378 --> 08:06.511
Brother speechless. I can leave
you alone, so unfaithful yes

08:37.482 --> 08:42.443
Your Honor, Mr. Pang has entered the palace

08:44.290 --> 08:47.259
They do not want to make peace?

08:47.360 --> 08:54.459
They want to know why breaking
a friendship agreement?

08:55.268 --> 09:03.368
there is no intention to fight.
/ Have you seen their troops?

09:03.476 --> 09:09.381
In addition to his front line troops, do not see
any other troops / you are absolutely innocent

09:09.482 --> 09:17.446
It's so easy to believe what he
said / I just report as I see it.

09:17.523 --> 09:22.290
Do they have any requirements?

09:23.396 --> 09:33.271
What would break with Ming's relationship?
/ Your Majesty, sorry ..

09:39.378 --> 09:42.438
Do you think they can
fulfill our request?

09:44.250 --> 09:49.381
These Joseon people love to learn,
will not be easy to approve

09:50.289 --> 09:57.286
If they do not agree, they can do what?
Maybe... will gain time

09:58.531 --> 10:05.460
Gain time, the way of life can appear?
Why are Joseons so stupid?

10:08.274 --> 10:12.506
General, now I work for Qing Qing,

10:19.318 --> 10:27.487
It looks tall and strong. But Joseon's city,
can only be surrounded from the outside

10:31.364 --> 10:37.269
Surround the city, then set a trap.
Destroy all roads.

10:38.270 --> 10:44.368
Ready / He says if not send
the crown prince as a hostage

10:47.313 --> 10:49.440
will not make peace

10:53.419 --> 10:58.288
The situation is dangerous. I'm willing to go there.

11:00.292 --> 11:05.457
Crown Prince, you go back first
/ Dad / Try saying your opinion

11:06.499 --> 11:16.374
Your Majesty, I honor the crown
prince of state security

11:16.442 --> 11:23.473
Will definitely come back safely.
- You mean that too?

11:25.284 --> 11:34.454
Tell me / Your Honor.
If it does not reconcile ..

11:34.527 --> 11:40.523
Your Honour! That speaks like
that, please cut their heads!

11:41.333 --> 11:45.463
Who agrees to hand over the crown
prince to them, who is the right side?

11:46.305 --> 11:51.299
Should have their head cut
and give it to the enemy

11:51.410 --> 11:56.473
That way, they will not make
such a silly request again

11:56.549 --> 12:06.254
It is true that Li Phan said. As an official,
it is not appropriate to speak like that.

12:06.325 --> 12:09.317
Your Majesty, do not do it.

12:09.428 --> 12:14.331
Your Majesty, do not do it.
This problem, do not discuss it again.

12:14.366 --> 12:19.269
Your Majesty, the enemy of
far-forth must have been prepared.

12:19.305 --> 12:23.503
Let them know you do
not hesitate to fight.

12:24.276 --> 12:32.376
Things that can be solved with
dialogue, even solve with weapons.

12:33.319 --> 12:39.315
What do you mean? / I'm not afraid to die.
The fear is them.

12:39.358 --> 12:46.457
So you want the king and the kingdom leave
it to them? / What I'm worried about ..

12:46.532 --> 12:50.298
if now do not give up the crown
prince to them, they are

12:50.336 --> 12:53.430
will make a more
difficult request.

12:53.506 --> 13:01.470
Your Majesty, if you surrender the
crown prince, they will belittle you

13:01.514 --> 13:10.320
Well... I know. Today
is enough until here.

13:12.424 --> 13:18.420
Where is Shang Sen? Quickly call the physician here!

13:27.473 --> 13:31.341
How many soldiers in the city?

13:31.443 --> 13:37.507
The troops are now added with the
soldiers who escort His Majesty here

13:38.484 --> 13:43.387
about 13 thousand soldiers.

13:45.257 --> 13:48.283
I heard the number of enemy
soldiers is much bigger.

13:50.262 --> 14:04.370
Looking from the region here, we
are able to block their attacks.

14:15.454 --> 14:20.414
Want to die? Do not light a fire on the city wall

14:21.327 --> 14:29.325
Sir, this boy does not know anything.
- I'm sorry. - What happened?

14:33.305 --> 14:36.274
They violate orders.
Light a fire without permission

14:39.345 --> 14:46.274
This kid never went to practice. Do not
understand the situation now. Please forgive him.

14:46.352 --> 14:50.311
Yeah, I really do not know anything.

14:51.290 --> 14:58.219
But... the weather is cold and tell
us war, at least do not die cold

14:58.297 --> 15:04.327
Still dare to argue! There
is no fire in the city wall.

15:04.370 --> 15:10.400
Otherwise, all will die in vain

15:11.410 --> 15:19.317
Can I share food with the guards here?
/ What?

15:21.287 --> 15:24.347
He is Tn.Kim Shang Huan

15:25.457 --> 15:34.456
Please share food with them.
It will warm their bodies

15:35.301 --> 15:41.262
What is your name? / I'm Li Thie, the smith

15:48.514 --> 15:53.417
If not send the crown
prince to them, what is

15:53.419 --> 15:58.322
will they do? / They will
ask you to go there.

16:00.492 --> 16:07.455
What if I do not go?
/ They will attack

16:08.434 --> 16:17.365
That's their opinion or you? That's
what their deputy commander says

16:20.512 --> 16:35.325
Can not let the crown prince go.
Dad will not give the child to the enemy

16:39.331 --> 16:49.400
Will they agree to make peace?
/ I'll try to talk to them

16:49.508 --> 16:55.344
Please do not worry

17:37.423 --> 17:41.325
How much food is there?

17:42.428 --> 17:49.391
If sparing can still last one month

17:49.501 --> 17:56.373
But the situation is uncertain,
I'm afraid they're strong

17:56.475 --> 18:01.378
Eating frugally is okay,
but do not be too frugal.

18:02.281 --> 18:06.479
What amount should
be given in one day?

18:07.519 --> 18:12.354
Is this something I
should teach you? /No

18:12.424 --> 18:18.363
Your Honor, the guard has
been cold all night.

18:18.363 --> 18:24.302
Cold until the whole
body is almost frozen

18:24.369 --> 18:32.504
Your Majesty, they can not
survive in such cold weather

18:33.278 --> 18:37.339
Our troops are cold.
Can only hope the sun

18:37.382 --> 18:41.443
It's not just our cold troop.

18:41.520 --> 18:48.289
The enemy must also be desperate,
the spirit of fighting also falls

18:48.393 --> 18:50.520
So that means, the enemy is cold,
our soldiers are all right?

18:51.530 --> 19:03.408
That's not it... / How about
sharing warm packs with them?

19:03.475 --> 19:10.313
Your Majesty, distributing warm
clothes to them, it's a bit difficult

19:19.458 --> 19:24.225
That's what he said /
Gather the grass bag

19:24.263 --> 19:28.359
and give them to warm the body

19:28.433 --> 19:38.399
If you collect bags of grass and
give them, it's much better

19:38.510 --> 19:41.479
So true

19:43.315 --> 19:46.443
Just do it / Thank you, Your Honor

19:46.485 --> 19:50.319
Thank you, Your Honor

20:19.418 --> 20:24.355
Jend.Long assume you're a special messenger.
But the king

20:24.356 --> 20:29.293
Joseon refused to meet.
It is regrettable

20:29.394 --> 20:34.491
Guests arrive with guns, then anxiety,
that's all. Please understand

20:35.467 --> 20:44.239
We carry guns to this place far away,
it's wrong who, rightly do not know?

20:44.309 --> 20:49.212
You also know. Joseon is Qing's
sister, Ming's country as a parent

20:49.514 --> 20:55.419
As a sister, should not you
understand the situation of a sister?

20:59.324 --> 21:03.488
At that time did not kill you,
and now do not destroy your city

21:04.329 --> 21:06.456
all thanks to His
Majesty's benevolence.

21:06.498 --> 21:09.331
Please do not forget it.

21:22.381 --> 21:29.287
King Joseon give all these
gifts to Jend.Long,

21:41.500 --> 21:46.267
The general says a few days did
not meet, your face getting pale.

21:46.371 --> 21:50.467
thank you for your attention

21:52.477 --> 21:58.279
this time I'm here to ask you
for a way to get out of town

22:02.421 --> 22:05.390
I told you

22:06.458 --> 22:08.483
this problem does not exist,

22:10.429 --> 22:13.455
relationship with the crown prince.

22:25.310 --> 22:32.239
so you want war?

22:35.454 --> 22:39.481
please tell me how to make peace?

22:48.467 --> 22:58.365
make Da Han angry, we are forced
here, this is all your king's fault.

22:58.510 --> 23:06.349
this is not the king's fault but me.
if you want the law, punish me.

23:11.456 --> 23:13.481
give up life

23:16.428 --> 23:17.417
if my life

23:19.531 --> 23:21.328
can bring peace...

23:31.543 --> 23:37.504
there is no other way. do not come
without bringing the crown prince.

23:39.384 --> 23:43.343
Da Han will be here

23:51.430 --> 23:58.302
why did you send him to negotiate with the enemy?
they will think we are afraid

23:58.336 --> 24:04.468
he deceived the crown prince,
also the king and the state

24:05.243 --> 24:10.271
he is not a traitor state.
people say he's his son

24:10.348 --> 24:16.253
even call him Long Ku Siau

24:16.321 --> 24:22.260
please immediately execute his
death and give it to the enemy

24:22.294 --> 24:26.424
please immediate execution of his death

24:27.299 --> 24:36.332
please immediate execution of his death

24:38.376 --> 24:40.241
shut up!

24:42.347 --> 24:45.248
Qing's army had already
surrounded this place. they

24:45.283 --> 24:47.478
have not attacked, you've
killed each other first

24:49.321 --> 24:53.280
Your Majesty, please execute me dead. then

24:53.458 --> 24:57.258
Crown Prince brings my head to the enemy

24:57.329 --> 25:03.290
it can be for negotiation ../ do not
talk about crown prince anymore

25:03.368 --> 25:14.245
this is a chance to
negotiate peace with them

25:14.312 --> 25:20.444
immediately send a letter to the general,
tell the dangerous situation in Nan Han

25:20.519 --> 25:25.354
and Your Majesty alone should
encourage the soldiers

25:25.423 --> 25:29.519
Your Honor, Da Han will be here

25:35.433 --> 25:41.303
will the king of Qing come here? / yes

25:41.373 --> 25:48.438
Chui Ming Ce conspires with the enemy

25:48.480 --> 25:53.349
Please Your Majesty need
not worry./ Qing want war

25:53.418 --> 26:00.324
come here under the winter
sky, it's hard to believe

26:01.359 --> 26:11.257
now is not the time for war / if it is true
here, must immediately tell the general.

26:21.279 --> 26:27.411
tell him to lead the troops here

26:27.452 --> 26:32.219
ready to execute command

26:32.357 --> 26:39.263
Your Majesty is wise

26:48.473 --> 26:55.208
because the kingdom has no funds, can
not protect you from cold weather.

26:58.350 --> 27:04.482
you are in the mountains, the
situation is very dangerous

27:05.290 --> 27:11.286
trying hard to protect the fort

27:12.297 --> 27:16.233
I was very upset, the whole
body like a needle stabbed

27:18.403 --> 27:24.308
now the enemy continues to threaten,
will not stop until the goal is reached

27:24.376 --> 27:28.472
a fierce enemy like a savage binatag

27:30.315 --> 27:37.244
their hearts are dark like wild animals.
difficult to reconcile

27:37.322 --> 27:39.449
only with war

27:40.392 --> 27:46.490
we must together defend
the last stronghold

27:47.298 --> 27:55.228
the truth is on our side. surely can
drive them out of our territory

27:56.307 --> 28:02.439
dangerous situation,
war can not be avoided

28:02.514 --> 28:12.321
San Nan troops must arrive soon.
the people will unite against the enemy

28:22.500 --> 28:27.403
must submit the letter and
return with their troops

28:27.439 --> 28:31.239
ready lakasanakan command

28:32.477 --> 28:35.241
all the fighters hear

28:36.347 --> 28:43.344
war can not be avoided

28:44.422 --> 28:51.260
the fate of this country is in your hands

29:04.309 --> 29:09.440
will soon arrive at the enemy territory.
all standby

29:09.514 --> 29:14.451
bullet content!

29:16.488 --> 29:20.515
I heard the enemy's head
will be able to 30 taels.

29:21.259 --> 29:25.286
it seems we can be rich

29:26.397 --> 29:32.267
new life can be rich.
You're behind me

29:32.337 --> 29:37.297
Calm down, I'm not
married, I will not die.

29:39.344 --> 29:42.336
quick countermeasures!

30:06.471 --> 30:09.372
Chi Fu ..!

30:18.316 --> 30:21.479
backwards ..!

30:48.313 --> 30:49.371
run fast!

31:09.534 --> 31:11.502
You want to fix this?

31:12.537 --> 31:16.496
these firearms are not
working properly.

31:17.242 --> 31:21.235
besides this, there are still
weapons that are hard to use

31:22.480 --> 31:30.353
they attack with big guns,
we can not get on target

31:30.421 --> 31:37.520
this issue should talk with
your boss, why look for me?

31:39.364 --> 31:50.263
they will not hear anyone like us / they
will think we are resisting the war

31:51.342 --> 31:58.441
why do you think i can listen to you guys?
/ Did not you give us food?

31:59.384 --> 32:07.223
that's Your Majesty's command /
please pay attention to this issue

32:15.433 --> 32:19.301
fast ..!

32:21.406 --> 32:24.307
fast if you do not want to die!

32:24.475 --> 32:26.375
fast!

32:28.513 --> 32:31.346
down here can see the city

32:32.283 --> 32:37.448
What is it hiding inside there?
what might be waiting for something?

32:39.257 --> 32:43.216
may be waiting for relief forces

32:44.529 --> 32:53.403
relief forces. along the way,
did not see Joseon's army.

32:55.273 --> 32:56.433
stupid..

33:00.311 --> 33:04.270
do not waste time. all must be
ready before Da Han arrives

33:06.517 --> 33:12.285
still no news?

33:12.357 --> 33:18.387
the road to here has been controlled by
the enemy. / So we wait here helpless?

33:18.529 --> 33:24.434
I'm afraid, will our soldiers hesitate

33:24.502 --> 33:30.407
fought with the enemy / it seems
the way here has been cut off

33:30.441 --> 33:33.501
aid troops are hard to arrive

33:34.278 --> 33:40.444

carrying a small child

38:50.328 --> 38:59.430
little boy entering the city in guarding the
enemy, that's bad / I want to see that kid

39:34.338 --> 39:42.507
when crossing the river, an old man
showed me the way but did not come back

42:39.290 --> 42:45.320
luckily there is a friend like king Qing. in
a chaotic situation, can still enjoy this

42:49.500 --> 42:55.302
it seems that you are not happy
with the victory this time

42:57.341 --> 43:06.477
only the last path has been disconnected / my
weapon capable of capturing the enemy's head

43:12.523 --> 43:19.258
enemy heads and hung on the streets,
can really defend this city?

43:21.532 --> 43:31.271
they want to kill him and this news
is widespread / I also heard it

43:33.510 --> 43:37.378

city, is it so precious?

43:39.316 --> 43:44.219
if so, please cut my head

43:48.359 --> 43:50.384
definitely not so valuable.

43:54.298 --> 43:58.496
can not open the main gate,
nor can it be maintained.

43:58.502 --> 44:03.405
it seems my head is worthless

44:04.375 --> 44:09.312
though worthless, should
also be well protected.

44:09.313 --> 44:14.250
so can only drink2

44:23.494 --> 44:31.367
you stand on whichever
side / not on any side.

44:31.368 --> 44:39.241
only a fighter killed the enemy

44:43.447 --> 44:49.511
if you know that, I'll
follow you in the army

45:12.509 --> 45:19.278

eating this kind of food war

45:19.383 --> 45:26.312
do not fuss, eat fast.
it's good to still eat

45:26.523 --> 45:34.294
They're so unlucky.
almost starving to death

45:39.503 --> 45:43.496
Your Majesty, the horses are starving to death

45:45.242 --> 45:48.234
then look for horse grass

45:48.378 --> 45:53.338
all the horse's grass is gone.
beyond the enemy's control

45:53.383 --> 46:01.483
folk grass houses can
be used for horse food

46:02.292 --> 46:10.358
Your Majesty, the horse eats a lot,
will not last long without food

46:10.400 --> 46:15.394
he does not think of
anything bigger. the

46:15.439 --> 46:20.433
human warriors, unable to
withstand cold weather

46:21.345 --> 46:27.375
how to fight an enemy without a horse

46:27.484 --> 46:36.483
if now grab their pockets
of grass, they can die cold

46:49.306 --> 46:57.372
What do you think? /
difficult to retrieve

46:58.348 --> 47:02.341
horses are animals, can not be sad.
the soldiers are

47:02.386 --> 47:06.379
man, if take theirs, I'm afraid
they will be disappointed

47:06.456 --> 47:13.328
I want to open my shirt give to them,

47:13.430 --> 47:19.426
but horses are important to fight.
difficult to win without a horse

what out of town and enemy opponents?

47:27.411 --> 47:30.505
please Your Majesty reconsider

used / where can it be?

48:07.284 --> 48:12.312
cold weather, how can we survive?
/ this is for the country.

48:12.389 --> 48:18.350
after the war is over, Your
Majesty will give big rewards.

must finish before sunset

48:57.501 --> 49:03.462
can really eat yes / pity,
not born as a horse

49:04.408 --> 49:06.308
is making a stupid thing

49:09.379 --> 49:15.318
this situation is chaotic, where to look?
/I am very scared

49:15.385 --> 49:22.416
one of their heads for how much?

49:22.526 --> 49:27.520
do not need much, just eat is good

49:29.333 --> 49:33.429
the one who brought it
/ the soldier we sent

49:42.479 --> 49:47.246
Fucker! where is the head scarf?

49:53.256 --> 49:59.286
cutting his head and hanging on the street.
should not happen again

50:01.531 --> 50:08.437
what to send people again?
/ more and more enemies

50:08.505 --> 50:14.410
and also increasingly besieged.
difficult to find a way out

50:14.511 --> 50:18.277
could not possibly
close all the way out

50:18.315 --> 50:21.375
things that can not be done?

50:24.287 --> 50:30.226
is there anything capable of breaking through enemy lines?

50:30.327 --> 50:37.290
in the city of many of your people, it
is impossible that no one can not do

50:37.334 --> 50:39.268
You want to run this task?

50:42.305 --> 50:48.301
this time fortunately did not happen apa2.
If it happens

50:48.311 --> 50:54.307
again, and fall into enemy hands.
the enemy must have attacked

51:09.266 --> 51:10.494
you just come back?

51:18.375 --> 51:21.344
are you waiting for me? / yes

51:22.479 --> 51:25.346

if it's fatter give us a meal, that's
better. / will you want to die?

53:13.490 --> 53:22.364
Da Han is here, we will surely die.

53:26.403 --> 53:27.427
Stop it!

53:30.540 --> 53:32.508
please do not be angry

53:33.243 --> 53:39.375
if not teach them military
regulations, can they submit to me?

53:39.482 --> 53:45.387
now kill him, may be able to submit

53:46.523 --> 53:56.330
but will eventually
lose their trust

54:11.314 --> 54:14.442
if it happens again,
I'll cut your head first

54:33.370 --> 54:36.430
since yesterday, more and more
enemies have surrounded the region

54:40.477 --> 54:42.377
Da Han came here

54:43.346 --> 54:48.443
Da Han is right already? / already
spread the news, Da Han is here

54:48.518 --> 54:54.479
but nobody saw him

54:55.258 --> 55:02.255
is it true? / he can
not be careless

55:02.399 --> 55:08.395
it seems that you really understand the enemy

55:09.272 --> 55:13.504
Hereafter comes many enemy troops

55:14.311 --> 55:22.446
Is it true? / yes /
please let me meet them

55:23.386 --> 55:30.417
let me be sure of that news /
everyone wants to make peace

55:30.527 --> 55:37.228
who will defend this city?

55:37.500 --> 55:45.407
give them meat and wine, maybe
accept our good intentions

55:45.475 --> 55:50.469
that's what he said

55:51.514 --> 55:57.475
New year brings food,

You go with him

56:20.443 --> 56:24.311
Thank you, Your Honor.

56:57.380 --> 57:03.444
This cannon is called Hong Yi,
originating from a foreign country.

57:03.520 --> 57:09.425
your king in a small town, will
not be able to go anywhere

57:09.459 --> 57:19.266
I heard your ancestors are also Joseon people

57:22.338 --> 57:27.332
My parents are slaves, so
I was born as a slave.

57:27.377 --> 57:32.371
In Joseon, slaves are not human

57:42.525 --> 57:47.326
tell them to bring back all these foods

57:47.497 --> 57:52.366
Why? do not like this food?

58:01.444 --> 58:06.507
bring it back, just give it to your king

58:07.317 --> 58:13.256
because there is nothing in the
capital, the preparation is incomplete.

58:13.256 --> 58:18.489
but this is all from the Joseon king.

58:19.462 --> 58:23.364
now Joeson already belongs to us. all
the food and wine also belongs to us

58:23.433 --> 58:30.430
I know you in the
city there is no food

58:31.441 --> 58:36.469
for us, meat and wine
is very valuable. let

58:36.513 --> 58:42.247
kings and officials you enjoy

58:43.486 --> 58:50.483
if brought back, that's not good

58:51.261 --> 58:55.493
Did not you bring back?
you want to make the general angry?

58:59.402 --> 59:03.429
we heard Da Han had arrived

59:03.540 --> 59:09.342
Da Han is right here? /
if we allow you to meet,

59:09.379 --> 59:15.249
we really want to pay respect.

59:21.324 --> 59:25.351
give respect to Da Han, it's better
for your king to come alone.

59:26.362 --> 59:30.321
so that's when?

59:33.436 --> 59:41.434
if it's time, Da Han
will tell your king

59:44.547 --> 59:56.482
Your Majesty, this is a great insult.
should not be left ..

59:56.526 --> 01:00:09.337

we saw the stairs in the enemy tent

01:00:19.382 --> 01:00:25.252
stairs? / they use Joseon
prisoners make a big staircase.

01:00:26.255 --> 01:00:30.351
the stairs can easily enter this city

01:00:30.426 --> 01:00:39.232
not just the stairs, there is also a big cannon.
much bigger than our cannon

01:00:39.402 --> 01:00:43.498
what about Da Han, do you see him?
/no

01:00:43.539 --> 01:00:48.340
see Da Han, but is preparing,

01:00:48.444 --> 01:00:56.351
the arrival of Da Han, then attacked this city

01:00:56.452 --> 01:01:06.453
all this is real / they do
not respect Your Majesty.

01:01:07.263 --> 01:01:09.493
please punish

01:01:10.333 --> 01:01:19.332
they rejected Your Majesty's present, but
Your Majesty has shown good intentions

01:01:19.409 --> 01:01:28.283
now the important thing should
be how to defend this city.

01:01:28.384 --> 01:01:32.286
if they use a large cannon,
the wall will be destroyed.

01:01:32.321 --> 01:01:35.518
what can still defend this city?

01:01:36.292 --> 01:01:40.456
what if we attack first?

01:01:40.530 --> 01:01:46.230
attack first? / yes / can win?

01:01:46.335 --> 01:01:50.237
custody of the enemy in the northern region is weaker

01:01:50.373 --> 01:01:54.366
all our powers are fixed
in that area. law

01:01:54.410 --> 01:01:58.403
the enemy forces are being
rude to your Majesty!

01:01:59.382 --> 01:02:04.479
Wang Cing is not far from here

01:02:05.455 --> 01:02:14.454
Your Majesty, we must fight
/ what do you think?

01:02:15.231 --> 01:02:23.366

not yet war, are you thinking about losing?

01:02:35.384 --> 01:02:43.450
if we use the strength of
our troops, we can win

01:02:45.394 --> 01:02:53.324
You are leading this task
/ ready to risk my life

01:02:54.504 --> 01:03:00.443
the fate of this country depends on you

01:03:01.244 --> 01:03:10.243

Send people there again

01:08:59.435 --> 01:09:00.493
Too late

01:09:01.437 --> 01:09:04.270
The rest of the power, send there!

01:09:04.340 --> 01:09:06.331
This war must win!

01:09:06.375 --> 01:09:09.401
Now it's too late to
send a relief troop.

01:09:09.511 --> 01:09:13.243
You want the opponent ?!

01:09:13.282 --> 01:09:15.375
Do not let all the soldiers die

01:09:18.386 --> 01:09:20.252
What are you doing..?

01:09:20.389 --> 01:09:21.447
Hurry back!

01:09:25.493 --> 01:09:27.394
That's a backward sign!

01:09:28.531 --> 01:09:32.365
All backed up!

01:09:34.270 --> 01:09:36.363
Back off ..!

01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:49.215
Attack! Kill it all ..!

01:11:01.390 --> 01:11:05.292
Can they see their corpses?

01:11:07.429 --> 01:11:10.296
It's covered by snow

01:11:12.434 --> 01:11:17.235
Must be buried both.

01:11:18.507 --> 01:11:25.379
Your Majesty, the problem of the soldiers
leave it to me, please do not worry.

01:11:27.283 --> 01:11:28.409
Do not worry?

01:11:30.252 --> 01:11:32.243
300 soldiers, all dead.

01:11:34.323 --> 01:11:36.450
Someone should be responsible

01:11:37.293 --> 01:11:39.454
If it should be responsible

01:11:40.329 --> 01:11:43.230
I'm willing to die to make amends.

01:11:43.465 --> 01:11:46.263
But if you want,

01:11:46.368 --> 01:11:51.499
execution of my death, refused
to give the relief troops

01:11:52.441 --> 01:11:55.239
and also did not defeat the enemy troops,

01:11:55.411 --> 01:11:58.278
also willing to die to make amends

01:11:59.348 --> 01:12:00.372
Who are they?

01:12:01.250 --> 01:12:04.447
Lee Shi-Baek, and the troops he leads

01:12:09.258 --> 01:12:14.389
I ordered Lee Shi-Baek to send
the relief troops, but refused

01:12:16.265 --> 01:12:16.492
Is that true?

01:12:17.433 --> 01:12:19.401
I think it's too late

01:12:19.468 --> 01:12:23.370
Saving our troops,
nothing too late ?!

01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:26.501
And the situation is very dangerous

01:12:27.376 --> 01:12:31.472
send a sign to plead backwards,
unable to defeat the enemy

01:12:32.281 --> 01:12:36.274
then it could be like that.
Please punish him

01:12:36.485 --> 01:12:41.388
Failed to do a good job.
Do not let it happen again

01:12:41.490 --> 01:12:43.287
Is that it?

01:12:43.425 --> 01:12:47.327
The person I was with saw everything

01:12:47.529 --> 01:12:51.488
Yes, that's a fact.

01:12:52.334 --> 01:12:55.303
Your Majesty, the situation is very dangerous,

01:12:56.372 --> 01:13:00.308
but Lee Shi-Baek that I know,
is not that kind of person.

01:13:00.376 --> 01:13:04.312
I heard they are from the same team

01:13:04.480 --> 01:13:09.417
Your Honor, Yi Pan failed to do
the job, disrupted the government

01:13:09.485 --> 01:13:14.252
He is very experienced in the
battlefield and meritorious

01:13:14.390 --> 01:13:19.293
If now punish him, would damage
the concentration of the soldiers

01:13:19.361 --> 01:13:23.263
Your Majesty, the law must be upheld!

01:13:23.399 --> 01:13:25.492
The general who lost all his
soldiers on the battlefield,

01:13:26.435 --> 01:13:29.268
however must be responsible!

01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:36.368
The law must be implemented, without exception!

01:13:36.445 --> 01:13:40.381
Your Honor, Lee Shi-Baek
is just following orders.

01:13:41.316 --> 01:13:43.477
Please forgive him. Let me be punished

01:13:43.552 --> 01:13:49.320
And immediately submit his position.

01:13:49.525 --> 01:13:52.392
From now on his position ..

01:13:54.363 --> 01:13:57.423
Kim Shiang Yan replaced him /
Your Majesty / This command!

01:13:58.367 --> 01:14:00.301
Do not tackle this problem again!

01:15:08.470 --> 01:15:10.335
Is this true?

01:15:10.506 --> 01:15:12.497
Have discussed it with him

01:15:13.375 --> 01:15:16.469
Open the main gate, reply to enemy attacks

01:15:17.479 --> 01:15:19.310
Maybe it works

01:15:20.349 --> 01:15:21.441
It must wait until when?

01:15:22.417 --> 01:15:24.317
Date 15

01:15:24.486 --> 01:15:27.455
What sure can do it?

01:15:28.457 --> 01:15:29.446
And all ready?

01:15:30.292 --> 01:15:34.388
When it is ready, there will be a big fire sign

01:15:37.399 --> 01:15:40.266
Yesterday a monk entered the city

01:15:41.403 --> 01:15:44.429
Looking around his camp

01:15:45.474 --> 01:15:47.339
He's around there?

01:15:47.442 --> 01:15:48.431
Yes, Your Honor.

01:15:49.278 --> 01:15:51.246
He led thousands of warriors,

01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:53.439
every moment can move.

01:15:54.449 --> 01:15:57.316
Attacking the enemy at night

01:15:58.320 --> 01:15:59.480
There is a chance of winning.

01:16:00.355 --> 01:16:02.414
What can be taken out of town?

01:16:03.258 --> 01:16:05.385
There is a way to get in, definitely also can come out.

01:16:06.428 --> 01:16:09.454
I'll get someone to
take him out of town

01:16:13.302 --> 01:16:16.465
Your Majesty, food in the
city is not much more

01:16:18.373 --> 01:16:23.310
If before the date 15 could not get out of the siege,
it would be really hard to get disqualified again.

01:16:34.323 --> 01:16:37.258
Only me and he know this problem.

01:16:38.527 --> 01:16:43.430
If anyone knows, I fear it will
be more dangerous, then do this.

01:16:45.267 --> 01:16:46.325
What does that mean?

01:16:48.503 --> 01:16:50.368
This important issue,

01:16:51.306 --> 01:16:53.365
could not have been handed over to a smith

01:16:54.476 --> 01:16:56.410
Now the country is in danger,

01:16:57.412 --> 01:17:00.506
there is not much choice.
- Eat, drink, have fun,

01:17:02.284 --> 01:17:04.377
really fucking.

01:17:06.321 --> 01:17:09.290
Somebody was better suited than me

01:17:13.462 --> 01:17:16.522
Officials here, do not really know the
situation inside and outside the city.

01:17:18.300 --> 01:17:20.268
Now the people I can trust,

01:17:21.470 --> 01:17:22.437
only you.

01:17:23.538 --> 01:17:26.302
This is very unheard of.

01:17:27.442 --> 01:17:32.379
What are the officials doing? Why is my
brother risking his life? Should not!

01:17:35.283 --> 01:17:39.344
If it can be taken out,
the war can really end?

01:17:39.421 --> 01:17:41.252
Kak / Right.

01:17:42.491 --> 01:17:45.460
If it is acceptable,
definitely come with help

01:17:47.429 --> 01:17:49.260
If the government moves out of here,

01:17:49.431 --> 01:17:51.490
people inside the new city can live.

01:17:51.533 --> 01:17:53.262
Life?

01:17:54.369 --> 01:17:56.428
It's all dead! Who else can survive?

01:17:56.471 --> 01:17:59.304
Chi Fu / At that time, the situation is very chaotic

01:18:00.308 --> 01:18:04.301
the bastards fled to our village.
Killing and kidnapping women.

01:18:04.379 --> 01:18:06.279
Do not talk anymore.

01:18:07.349 --> 01:18:10.409
My brother is helpless, just seeing
his wife and child killed killed!

01:18:11.319 --> 01:18:15.312
Kings and you officials
fled to Chiang Hua island.

01:18:16.324 --> 01:18:18.451
Sir, then, where are you ?!
/ Jangna talk again!

01:18:21.430 --> 01:18:22.397
I..

01:18:25.267 --> 01:18:27.258
can not even find my parent's corpse!

01:18:48.290 --> 01:18:49.348
Have you had breakfast?

01:18:51.293 --> 01:18:54.421
Yes, have eaten in the kitchen.

01:19:01.369 --> 01:19:04.338
I do not want to eat, just take it away.

01:19:04.506 --> 01:19:10.240
Eat no new year cake,
can not add age.

01:19:13.281 --> 01:19:15.249
I am old.

01:19:16.351 --> 01:19:18.319
It's okay to add age.

01:19:19.387 --> 01:19:21.378
It should also eat.

01:19:32.467 --> 01:19:37.427
I am full. This gift of kings,
should not be thrown away

01:19:39.541 --> 01:19:41.509
Can you eat it for me?

01:19:43.345 --> 01:19:46.314
Can I really eat it?

01:19:49.284 --> 01:19:53.516
If it does not eat up this
cake, the king will punish me.

01:19:58.493 --> 01:20:01.428
I will eat out, please do not worry.

01:21:12.300 --> 01:21:14.325
What are they doing now?

01:21:16.371 --> 01:21:19.397
King Joseon wanted to meet King Qing

01:21:20.442 --> 01:21:21.466
to give a new year gift.

01:21:22.377 --> 01:21:27.246
What do you say? Meet the king of Qing?
Heading to Beijing?

01:21:27.515 --> 01:21:31.281
Your Majesty, I'm useless. I
will use their destroyed cannon.

01:21:33.288 --> 01:21:36.348
Ready!

01:21:54.276 --> 01:21:56.403
Stop!

01:21:58.513 --> 01:22:02.210
New year there is the smell of gunpowder, bring bad luck.

01:22:02.517 --> 01:22:04.508
I can not stay where to look,

01:22:05.420 --> 01:22:06.352
their actions

01:22:06.421 --> 01:22:10.357
Just leave them alone.
They just do their job.

01:22:47.329 --> 01:22:51.265
Your Honor, I think they are here

01:22:52.267 --> 01:22:57.295
instead of destroying the main gate from the
outside, but starting to break from the inside.

01:22:59.307 --> 01:23:02.401
First, we have to send a letter to him.
Negotiate with him.

01:23:02.510 --> 01:23:07.379
Your Majesty, this is different from negotiating with him

01:23:08.249 --> 01:23:12.345
Among the kings, give each other hope

01:23:13.321 --> 01:23:16.449
Previously did not give a
formal letter or letter

01:23:16.491 --> 01:23:20.325
personal, come visit tiba2,
will not bring results

01:23:21.329 --> 01:23:24.298
Your Majesty, behind him
is the Ming kingdom.

01:23:24.299 --> 01:23:27.268
Otherwise, it will
not last long.

01:23:28.336 --> 01:23:31.362
As long as they disin, we must
find a way out of this city

01:23:31.406 --> 01:23:35.308
He will not be here long, so do not
open the gates from inside the city.

01:23:35.343 --> 01:23:38.210
Because not too long,
if the main gate is not

01:23:38.279 --> 01:23:40.440
opened, he will destroy the
main gate from the outside.

01:23:40.515 --> 01:23:46.351
If now send an official letter,
he will think he is king.

01:23:46.388 --> 01:23:50.256
Do not talk again / Will Your
Majesty meet his request?

01:23:51.292 --> 01:23:52.418
There is no other way

01:23:54.429 --> 01:23:56.397
To survive, there is no other way

01:23:56.464 --> 01:24:01.333
He wants to use His Majesty,
to enter the enemy's nest!

01:24:03.371 --> 01:24:08.240
If not, will not get out of life / The road
to life and mat there is a beautiful place

01:24:08.510 --> 01:24:11.479
Why enter incoming hive?
/ I told you to shut up!

01:24:12.313 --> 01:24:16.409
Your Majesty, you can not give up on him

01:24:16.518 --> 01:24:19.510
This is something that should not happen

01:24:20.288 --> 01:24:23.280
The world can not have 2 suns.

01:24:23.491 --> 01:24:28.394
You forgot the blessing of the new Ming
king can defend the position of the king?

01:24:28.430 --> 01:24:33.424
Right, Your Honor. This should not happen.

01:24:42.310 --> 01:24:44.244
They will not stop

01:24:45.313 --> 01:24:47.281
I just stopped myself.

01:24:51.486 --> 01:24:53.317
Your Honour

01:24:56.391 --> 01:25:01.419
Truth and position they
mean, for what exactly?

01:25:03.498 --> 01:25:10.199
Submit a new life there is truth
and position, is that true?

01:25:35.396 --> 01:25:38.388
If my sister had to leave,
I would have gone too.

01:25:38.466 --> 01:25:43.369
Beyond that already surrounded by enemy
troops, it would be easier to get caught.

01:25:45.340 --> 01:25:47.467
Here you are

01:25:48.243 --> 01:25:50.336
After my sister leaves, I
will also be sent out of town

01:25:51.279 --> 01:25:54.510
If I get married, people
inside the city will be saved.

01:25:55.350 --> 01:25:59.309
If your brother's life is threatened ..
/ Do not talk like that.

01:26:03.258 --> 01:26:04.452
I want to see you married just dead.

01:26:13.401 --> 01:26:15.301
Sister must hurry back

01:26:22.310 --> 01:26:25.370
If you can send this
and come back with

01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:28.440
congratulations, Your Majesty
will give you a big reward.

01:26:29.350 --> 01:26:33.343
I do this not for Your Majesty

01:26:34.355 --> 01:26:39.486
Your Majesty and your officials, how in
the future, have nothing to do with me.

01:26:42.430 --> 01:26:47.390
People like me, just
trying to survive.

01:26:48.369 --> 01:26:51.429
Trying not to starve,
that's all we hope

01:27:41.389 --> 01:27:44.415
This winter is very quiet.

01:27:50.298 --> 01:27:54.359
And it's been in the
last winter, spring soon

01:27:56.404 --> 01:27:58.372
as long as we survive during the winter

01:28:01.442 --> 01:28:03.376
can only welcome spring.

01:28:11.319 --> 01:28:12.308
Yi Phang.

01:28:16.457 --> 01:28:18.425
He's out of town

01:28:26.401 --> 01:28:27.390
Catch him!

01:28:41.316 --> 01:28:43.511
Definitely have not gone far! Scattered looking!

01:29:28.429 --> 01:29:31.262
If we strike with full force,

01:29:32.433 --> 01:29:36.460
less than a day, the city will be destroyed.
All is ready, just wait for orders.

01:29:37.271 --> 01:29:41.332
You do not know the difference I came here,

01:29:41.476 --> 01:29:45.276
and I did not come here?

01:29:47.315 --> 01:29:51.513
To get the little town, I,

01:29:52.487 --> 01:29:55.354
still need to add troops?

01:29:56.424 --> 01:30:04.229
If they were willing to go out, the new
king's authority could shine upon the world

01:30:05.299 --> 01:30:06.493
My insights are limited

01:30:08.302 --> 01:30:13.330
Bring someone who can write here.
I want to send a letter to them.

01:30:17.478 --> 01:30:24.350
You want to be my enemy,
constantly against me

01:30:25.286 --> 01:30:29.450
Looking for dead alone. Your
ignorance becomes immoral

01:30:30.358 --> 01:30:37.264
This problem, I'm distracted,
then come to your place

01:30:38.232 --> 01:30:46.367
You want to live? Open the
main gate, walk towards me.

01:30:47.275 --> 01:30:51.302
I will hear your request,
and fulfill your request

01:30:52.246 --> 01:30:55.409
After, be able to talk
to me without fear

01:30:56.484 --> 01:31:04.289
You want to look dead? You are like
this now, getting into the rock

01:31:04.459 --> 01:31:10.261
You want a war with me? You,

01:31:10.364 --> 01:31:18.430
we will meet in the front line, I
will tell you the predestined victory

01:31:22.510 --> 01:31:25.445
He wants me out of town

01:31:31.419 --> 01:31:35.446
If I go out, what will happen?

01:31:35.523 --> 01:31:41.428
Your Honour. This country belongs to His Majesty.
No need to always ask us ..

01:31:41.462 --> 01:31:43.453
If you did not ask, what
do you want me to do ?!

01:31:45.233 --> 01:31:49.465
If Your Majesty's opinion,
we fully support it.

01:32:04.452 --> 01:32:07.353
I want to survive.

01:32:10.258 --> 01:32:11.418
That's my opinion.

01:32:14.295 --> 01:32:17.264
Your Honour. If you
want to survive, please

01:32:17.298 --> 01:32:20.267
replied the letter. Open
communication with them.

01:32:20.334 --> 01:32:25.431
You want to survive,
that's a good idea. Not

01:32:25.473 --> 01:32:31.309
need to reply to the letter.
/ Where is that person now?

01:32:33.281 --> 01:32:37.445
Soon on 15th. When did the troops arrive?

01:32:37.518 --> 01:32:41.386
Your Majesty, please keep calm.
Be patient

01:32:41.389 --> 01:32:45.257
waiting.
- Tgl.15, they will destroy this city.

01:32:46.327 --> 01:32:48.488
They want to kill me!

01:32:48.529 --> 01:32:54.490
There's still time before the 15th.
It will come.

01:32:55.269 --> 01:32:58.534
Your Honour. What does it mean to light a big fire?

01:33:00.341 --> 01:33:02.275
What exactly does that mean?

01:33:02.343 --> 01:33:06.507
This is so important, why take your
own decision without telling us?

01:33:07.281 --> 01:33:09.442
Li Pheng did not understand
the war strategy at all.

01:33:09.483 --> 01:33:12.384
Just leave it to
someone like that.

01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.354
It turned out to surrender my
kingdom's fate to such a person.

01:33:15.289 --> 01:33:16.381
You really want to save me?

01:33:16.457 --> 01:33:22.327
This problem is very urgent.
From the beginning it was wrong to act

01:33:22.430 --> 01:33:27.265
Now can only send the letter

01:33:27.368 --> 01:33:33.273
He will understand His
Majesty wants to survive

01:33:33.507 --> 01:33:37.238
Correct. You reply to the letter

01:33:38.279 --> 01:33:42.511
All my wishes, write
clearly to them

01:33:47.321 --> 01:33:56.389
Your Honour. If I want to kneel in
order to survive, I'd rather die.

01:34:01.502 --> 01:34:06.235
I want to live! But why
did you choose to die?

01:34:09.443 --> 01:34:13.277
In this city, not
only can he write.

01:34:16.283 --> 01:34:19.343
Please keep the good name of Kim Shang Huan.

01:34:21.455 --> 01:34:28.293
Good. So many officials,
not only he can write.

01:34:28.429 --> 01:34:31.455
Who wants to write this reply?

01:34:37.338 --> 01:34:42.332
Afraid?! Want to break out!
Afraid to die in their hands ?!

01:34:42.476 --> 01:34:45.309
Want to write a reply
so as not to be killed.

01:34:45.346 --> 01:34:47.473
Are you afraid of being
a great sinner ?!

01:34:52.386 --> 01:34:57.449
Your Honour. I will write it.

01:35:08.369 --> 01:35:09.427
Already aware?

01:35:13.474 --> 01:35:18.309
Here where? / You need not worry.
This is the military camp of the Great General.

01:35:29.523 --> 01:35:34.290
The letter is on us. It's
given to the general.

01:35:36.397 --> 01:35:39.366
You alone from Nan Han here?

01:35:40.301 --> 01:35:44.362
Yes / you have done
something difficult.

01:35:44.405 --> 01:35:48.466
Who is your commander?
May I ask your name?

01:35:49.410 --> 01:35:56.316
I'm not a soldier, just a smith.
My name is Shi Li Thie.

01:35:59.386 --> 01:36:05.416
So who gave this letter to you?
/Tn.Shang Huan give me

01:36:10.397 --> 01:36:16.302
Pig oil. I hear it's good for your
treatment / you here for this?

01:36:17.505 --> 01:36:21.407
Have you heard?

01:36:21.475 --> 01:36:26.310
You mean my brother's news?

01:36:26.380 --> 01:36:31.317
It does not matter / For me,
my sister is more important.

01:36:33.521 --> 01:36:37.457
Beware / Chi Fu / If I go
too long will be punished

01:36:59.547 --> 01:37:01.515
What are you doing?

01:37:06.253 --> 01:37:08.312
Why still not sleep, even outside?

01:37:08.389 --> 01:37:13.292
The weather is cold, you come back late
at night, then come out waiting for you.

01:37:23.337 --> 01:37:25.305
You picture fish?

01:37:27.508 --> 01:37:30.477
Yeah, this is Ba Er fish.

01:37:31.412 --> 01:37:32.379
Ba Er?

01:37:33.347 --> 01:37:39.377
Fish that live in the river. Fragrant and sweet.

01:37:40.387 --> 01:37:42.321
Why do you know so clearly?

01:37:43.290 --> 01:37:49.422
Every spring, grandfather catches this fish

01:37:53.367 --> 01:37:58.361
If Song Puo Chiang gets frozen,
I'll catch Ba Er giving it to you.

01:38:01.275 --> 01:38:03.243
When can Song Puo Chiang be frozen?

01:38:04.345 --> 01:38:07.405
When the flowers bloom will freeze

01:38:09.416 --> 01:38:15.412
Yes. After winter ends,
the flowers will bloom.

01:38:41.548 --> 01:38:50.252
Your Majesty, do not ..!

01:38:50.324 --> 01:38:55.352
The reply letter just wanted,

01:38:55.396 --> 01:39:00.459
all of Joseon gave to the enemy.
Your Honour!

01:39:01.268 --> 01:39:07.332
Please immediately burn the reply letter ,.
That bastard penggal

01:39:13.480 --> 01:39:26.348
Your Majesty, my insights are limited.
Do not write your sincerity clearly

01:39:27.361 --> 01:39:30.330
Is it just for survival?

01:39:31.365 --> 01:39:40.433
Your Majesty, is that letter really true.
That's the essence of the letter

01:39:41.475 --> 01:39:46.469
The way that His Majesty wants
to go / Now all our soldiers,

01:39:47.314 --> 01:39:55.278
surviving in cold and
hunger, guarding this city.

01:39:55.322 --> 01:39:58.450
Tomorrow tgl.15. Tonight,
it will be a big fire.

01:39:58.492 --> 01:40:02.326
The help troops will arrive.

01:40:02.429 --> 01:40:10.336
If today does not send a reply
letter, they will break in

01:40:10.404 --> 01:40:14.465
Everything will be burned
down / Just one night.

01:40:14.508 --> 01:40:19.309
Why can not last just one night?

01:40:19.413 --> 01:40:25.374
Forever faithful, but
really no other choice.

01:40:25.519 --> 01:40:33.517
Even though tomorrow, you ordered me
to kill, please give me my letter

01:40:34.261 --> 01:40:37.355
If so, Your Majesty will
be under their control.

01:40:37.398 --> 01:40:41.198
It's nothing like giving up.

01:40:41.335 --> 01:40:46.466
If you are on your knees and
pour the wine, you will do it?

01:40:47.307 --> 01:40:51.437
During this time, the strong suppress the weak.
The weak too

01:40:51.478 --> 01:40:56.347
in order to survive, there is
nothing that can not be done.

01:40:56.417 --> 01:41:03.255
You want to come out here alive?
/ That's what he said

01:41:03.490 --> 01:41:10.293
But life like that is a great
insult / Although it must die

01:41:12.366 --> 01:41:19.431
I'd rather die honorably. /
Your Honor, please reconsider

01:41:20.307 --> 01:41:23.435
Dead he meant, could
not support life

01:41:23.510 --> 01:41:29.312
Can not distinguish life and
death, life is just an insult.

01:41:29.349 --> 01:41:33.285
Can not accept death, but
can accept humiliation.

01:41:34.388 --> 01:41:39.257
Your Honour. Please do not die with the people

01:41:39.293 --> 01:41:45.254
A king, to die must be brave

01:41:45.365 --> 01:41:50.268
Do not beg and ask forgiveness
in front of rakayat

01:41:51.505 --> 01:41:55.407
I can not accept and
serve a king like that.

01:41:57.411 --> 01:42:01.279
It's better to have my head /
head piece like that what?

01:42:05.319 --> 01:42:13.419
Although under the enemy's leg. Looking for
a living night for the country and people

01:42:13.494 --> 01:42:19.296
That is a people who are respected
by the people and the king's aides.

01:42:21.301 --> 01:42:28.366
Please cut my head first.
Please Your Majesty,

01:42:32.479 --> 01:42:34.276
do not let this humiliation happen.

01:42:47.427 --> 01:42:53.388
Although this is a war, but leave this
letter to the smith. What makes sense?

01:42:54.334 --> 01:42:58.395
How can we believe the
letter the man brought?

01:42:58.472 --> 01:43:02.465
This is true of the king's seal

01:43:05.379 --> 01:43:08.439
If, however, turn on
the big fire there,

01:43:08.448 --> 01:43:11.508
the enemy will surely know.
We will be in danger.

01:43:12.319 --> 01:43:17.313
The place was not easy to destroy.
Maybe they inside could get out alive2

01:43:17.457 --> 01:43:21.484
According to the man, the enemy
forces are not far from here.

01:43:22.296 --> 01:43:29.464
We retreat from a distance of
course, watching in a safe place

01:43:32.372 --> 01:43:34.499
How would you like to be responsible?

01:43:39.279 --> 01:43:44.273
If we do not receive the
letter, is not it better?

01:45:17.411 --> 01:45:20.346
Spy! Do not let him escape!

01:45:48.375 --> 01:45:49.364
Come on!

01:46:22.342 --> 01:46:23.331
Hurry!

01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:27.447
Stop!

01:46:31.418 --> 01:46:33.409
Joseon military camp is definitely around here

01:46:34.388 --> 01:46:38.256
Acknowledge and find their position!

01:47:00.514 --> 01:47:10.253
If you bring this letter, the war will end.
I will not hesitate at all.

01:47:11.258 --> 01:47:17.390
I'm... willing to pay any penalty

01:47:19.232 --> 01:47:23.430
People will say you're a traitor.

01:47:25.372 --> 01:47:32.369
Your Majesty, next time back the
castle, do not leave Shang Huan.

01:47:34.381 --> 01:47:39.478
He's the only loyal officer.

01:47:42.289 --> 01:47:44.416
I am also a loyal officer

01:47:54.267 --> 01:47:58.499
I'm a big... sinner.

01:49:24.324 --> 01:49:27.225
Very cold

01:49:27.527 --> 01:49:34.365
Absolutely. Can only
fight before freezing.

01:49:34.467 --> 01:49:37.368
You still have pork oil?

01:49:46.479 --> 01:49:53.317
This war is hard to live.
Why did the king escape here?

01:49:53.420 --> 01:50:00.349
But... is it true that the troops can come?
/ My sister is not an ordinary person.

01:50:01.428 --> 01:50:07.492
Let's see later. Sister will definitely
bring back troops./If so true,

01:50:08.301 --> 01:50:11.429
I'll fool my daughter
with you / Right? /Basic.

01:50:11.438 --> 01:50:15.272
Why not trust people yes.

01:50:16.509 --> 01:50:18.340
Beautiful? /Certain

01:50:20.313 --> 01:50:21.280
It's so pretty.

01:51:04.424 --> 01:51:05.391
Son ..

01:51:09.429 --> 01:51:11.226
Where are you?

01:51:12.298 --> 01:51:13.265
Son!

01:51:19.439 --> 01:51:20.371
Son ..

01:51:46.399 --> 01:51:50.460
Last...!

01:52:43.356 --> 01:52:50.489
Your Majesty... quickly run away ..! Your Honour!

01:52:58.338 --> 01:53:08.304
Stop the attack! I have the
letter of the king of Joseon!

01:53:08.348 --> 01:53:09.508
What's he talking about?

01:53:10.450 --> 01:53:19.324
This is a reply to the Joseon king.
Please stop the attack.

01:53:40.246 --> 01:53:45.240
Last! Who dare to
retreat, I'll kill!

01:53:45.351 --> 01:53:52.348
Your Majesty, this is the reply of Joseon king.
Please stop the attack.

01:53:53.359 --> 01:54:00.265
King Joseon has sworn, willing
to bow to the emperor.

01:54:17.450 --> 01:54:26.358
The king means no more slaughter.
Joseon's people are innocent.

01:54:32.532 --> 01:54:37.401
Please... do not kill them.

01:54:50.316 --> 01:54:52.409
Chi Fu ..!

01:54:52.485 --> 01:54:57.445
Chi Fu, hang on! Get up fast!

01:55:04.464 --> 01:55:10.494
Fucker... you die!
If my brother comes back...

01:55:21.381 --> 01:55:26.341
This just got my point!

01:55:26.419 --> 01:55:30.355
Stop the attack!

01:56:07.327 --> 01:56:09.352
Are you all right?

01:57:03.549 --> 01:57:05.312
Brother ..

01:57:39.318 --> 01:57:45.314
Chi Fu... get up.

01:57:53.499 --> 01:57:56.229
Come back with me.

01:57:58.371 --> 01:58:00.271
Chi Fu!

01:58:35.508 --> 01:58:40.275
Check all residences of officials.

01:58:40.379 --> 01:58:45.510
All letters should be burned.

01:58:53.259 --> 01:59:00.222
I heard that you have resigned. /
The war is over, there must be

01:59:00.266 --> 01:59:07.229
responsible. I will not
escape responsibility.

01:59:07.406 --> 01:59:13.311
You must not bear all
these responsibilities. I

01:59:13.346 --> 01:59:19.251
it's hard to tell how this
country got this way.

01:59:21.487 --> 01:59:26.356
His Majesty came out of
here, guaranteed of them

01:59:28.494 --> 01:59:37.402
Can not keep promises to bring
His Majesty to Shen Yang

01:59:39.438 --> 01:59:45.468
They promise not to kill the
people and warriors in this city.

01:59:49.482 --> 01:59:58.356
Is not this the end you want?
/ Sir, we're back

01:59:58.424 --> 02:00:08.459
and rebuilding the kingdom.
That's our responsibility.

02:00:10.236 --> 02:00:18.302
I will not bow to them.

02:00:20.246 --> 02:00:31.418
Obviously there is a way of life, why talk
the way of death? / Is there a way of life?

02:00:34.393 --> 02:00:38.420
So what do you mean the
way of life, what is it

02:00:38.464 --> 02:00:43.197
in fact? / New life can
lead to new paths.

02:00:44.437 --> 02:00:53.436
Is it a way for people or kings? /
People and kings are walking together.

02:00:56.449 --> 02:01:02.388
I do not think so,
but I make mistakes.

02:01:05.491 --> 02:01:14.331
New avenues for passing people,
new in the new kingdom.

02:01:17.336 --> 02:01:25.505
You and me too. The king we
support is also the case.

02:01:30.416 --> 02:01:33.510
I realize this all
while in this city.

02:01:52.505 --> 02:02:00.276
Her name is Na Lu. Can you
help me take care of her?

02:02:03.449 --> 02:02:07.476
He has no one. Very sorry.

02:02:10.456 --> 02:02:18.454
But this is my last request-
/ What is your plan?

02:02:20.399 --> 02:02:29.501
I have to face what I have to deal with.
- It's useless.

02:02:33.479 --> 02:02:39.418
It's called Feng Shiang, to burn wood fire

02:02:48.294 --> 02:02:50.421
I'll take care of it

02:02:56.335 --> 02:03:02.433
If my daughter is alive, it is as big as her.

02:03:45.451 --> 02:03:47.351
Take good care of yourself.

02:03:49.255 --> 02:03:52.520
Can you still come see me?

02:03:56.395 --> 02:03:58.386
I come to come when the flowers bloom.

02:03:59.498 --> 02:04:07.337
When the river water melts, I will
repair the boat, you must come yes.

02:04:30.429 --> 02:04:35.298
King Joseon will come out of the west door.

02:04:37.269 --> 02:04:43.367
The sinful king Joseon, can not
get out of the South entrance.

02:04:45.511 --> 02:04:51.450
King Joseon can not bring bodyguards

02:04:52.318 --> 02:04:59.315
King Joseon had to take off the king's shirt,
replace it with a regular blue sweatshirt.

02:05:00.326 --> 02:05:07.459
King Joseon, walked by there. Kneel,

02:05:08.267 --> 02:05:16.436
in front of the Qing emperor,
as a sign of surrender.

02:05:58.450 --> 02:06:05.356
Where will the king go? / Return to the palace

02:06:05.491 --> 02:06:10.258
But why cry?

02:06:18.470 --> 02:06:25.308
Because the king wants to go home, so happy

02:06:48.467 --> 02:06:53.404
Your Majesty, from here, can not ride a horse.

02:08:29.468 --> 02:08:37.239
Subject to me, feel very comforted.

02:08:37.309 --> 02:08:40.437
Everything that has happened
will not be discussed again.

02:08:46.318 --> 02:08:50.345
I want to talk future things with you

02:08:52.357 --> 02:08:54.484
Thank you, Your Honor

02:09:04.403 --> 02:09:10.342
King Joseon! Pay homage to
His Majesty the emperor!

02:09:24.490 --> 02:09:30.258
Sincerely, first!

02:15:31.389 --> 02:15:35.223
Let's play kites.

02:15:38.396 --> 02:15:41.422
Do not go too far.

02:15:42.305 --> 02:15:48.924
