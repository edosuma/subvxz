01:13.680 --> 01:18.519
When I was young, I wasn't
so clear on the whole gravity thing,

01:18.520 --> 01:22.081
and my imagination got me
in a lot of trouble.

01:28.800 --> 01:33.639
But there was this one moment
when time stopped

01:33.640 --> 01:35.608
and everything made sense.

01:40.320 --> 01:42.879
Then I landed and broke my wrist.

01:42.880 --> 01:44.479
But from that day on

01:44.480 --> 01:48.399
I've always known that
in another life I could fly,

01:48.400 --> 01:51.882
and that's why in this life I dance.

01:52.880 --> 01:54.839
Tara.

01:57.120 --> 01:58.639
Sorry.

02:05.680 --> 02:07.921
Go on!

02:09.800 --> 02:12.644
Aunty Bev just called.

02:14.200 --> 02:16.089
The post's on its way.

02:17.560 --> 02:18.919
Go.

02:18.920 --> 02:21.239
Right now,
in the back of a van,

02:21.240 --> 02:24.399
there's a letter
that could change my life...

02:24.400 --> 02:26.402
Move!

02:35.680 --> 02:38.559
Because, see, I don't just dance.

02:38.560 --> 02:41.159
I want to be a principal dancer

02:41.160 --> 02:44.243
and three weeks ago I auditioned
for the top school in the country...

02:58.160 --> 03:01.639
the National Academy of Dance.

03:01.640 --> 03:06.043
It was my year, my one shot...

03:08.720 --> 03:11.719
and I thought
I was ready for anything.

03:11.720 --> 03:13.639
I didn't have a clue.

03:35.960 --> 03:37.639
You think
you're funny, don't you?

03:37.640 --> 03:39.359
Oh, I'll wipe
that smile right off...

03:39.360 --> 03:42.479
Excuse me. Dressing rooms?
Um...

03:42.480 --> 03:44.679
Are you auditioning as well?
Isn't it exciting?

03:44.680 --> 03:46.639
I just peed a little in my pants.

03:46.640 --> 03:48.688
OK, so you are...

03:51.680 --> 03:52.839
You're here.

03:52.840 --> 03:54.599
Just go straight
down that corridor, turn left,

03:54.600 --> 03:56.799
and it's the second
door on your left.

03:56.800 --> 03:59.724
Thank you.
Don't mention it.

04:17.519 --> 04:19.999
Don't let me stop you.

04:20.000 --> 04:23.519
I have pepper spray in my bag
and I'm not afraid to use it!

04:23.520 --> 04:25.879
Well, I was just standing here,
minding my own business.

04:25.880 --> 04:27.719
In the girls' dressing room?!

04:27.720 --> 04:30.679
Pretty sure those
are urinals in there.

04:30.680 --> 04:32.330
Unless you can go standing up?

04:33.560 --> 04:35.369
You might need this.

04:36.720 --> 04:39.041
Can you turn around, please?

04:41.040 --> 04:44.679
So is it an attention thing?
What?

04:44.680 --> 04:46.719
You know, stripping
in front of strangers.

04:46.720 --> 04:49.479
'Cause that's cool. I mean,
I'm sure they have support groups.

04:49.480 --> 04:51.448
If you're looking,
I swear I'll hurt you.

04:57.120 --> 05:00.679
Sorry, guys. I'll come back later.

05:00.680 --> 05:02.559
Oh! No, we weren't...

05:06.480 --> 05:08.279
Wait! That wasn't anything.

05:08.280 --> 05:10.839
I mean, obviously it was
something, but it wasn't what...

05:10.840 --> 05:12.999
Hey, no judgement.

05:13.000 --> 05:16.959
Please can you take me to the girls'
dressing room? It's an emergency.

05:16.960 --> 05:19.639
Come on.

05:19.640 --> 05:22.039
So, audition week, huh?

05:22.040 --> 05:23.999
Is it that obvious?
No.

05:24.000 --> 05:27.239
Well, you do have that whole
wide-eyed Bambi thing going on

05:27.240 --> 05:29.599
and I'm pretty sure
this top is inside-out.

05:29.600 --> 05:31.443
But, hey, it's a good look.

05:35.440 --> 05:37.568
Put it back on, Ethan.

05:39.640 --> 05:41.119
This is you.

05:41.120 --> 05:42.759
Thanks.

05:42.760 --> 05:44.808
Good luck.

05:53.840 --> 05:56.759
Welcome to the National
Academy of Dance,

05:56.760 --> 06:00.799
one of the most elite
training institutions in the world.

06:00.800 --> 06:02.719
You have all been chosen...

06:02.720 --> 06:05.559
from amongst thousands of dancers.

06:05.560 --> 06:07.839
Sorry.

06:07.840 --> 06:12.840
However, we only have room
in first year for just a few.

06:13.680 --> 06:16.799
It will be your job
over the next few days

06:16.800 --> 06:18.689
to make sure you're among them.

06:23.080 --> 06:26.279
OK, can the boys finish warming up
and follow me next door?

06:26.280 --> 06:28.239
Girls, you're staying here
with Miss Raine.

06:28.240 --> 06:30.322
Patrick, can I have a word?

06:31.440 --> 06:33.681
This young man
didn't bring any tights.

06:47.880 --> 06:49.919
Hey, did you find
the dressing rooms OK?

06:49.920 --> 06:52.366
Fine, thanks.

06:55.800 --> 06:59.247
Come on. Dance!
Um...

07:00.240 --> 07:01.844
So you met Kat?

07:03.680 --> 07:05.319
We were all
at junior school together.

07:05.320 --> 07:08.767
Kat's... lots of fun.

07:09.760 --> 07:13.319
Um, yeah. OK. Cool.

07:13.320 --> 07:15.879
But the staff know that
if you're friends with her,

07:15.880 --> 07:18.079
then you're not really
taking dancing seriously.

07:18.080 --> 07:20.799
Bad impression to make
in audition week.

07:20.800 --> 07:22.839
Got it.

07:22.840 --> 07:25.810
Nice leotard.
Oh, thanks. My mum made it.

07:29.440 --> 07:32.039
I'm Abigail. This is Georgia.

07:32.040 --> 07:33.759
I'm Tara Webster.

07:33.760 --> 07:36.730
You and I are room-mates.
Oh, yay.

07:39.800 --> 07:44.439
So, I know it sounds ridiculous,
but I have this thing.

07:44.440 --> 07:46.599
Abigail always stands
at the front of the barre.

07:46.600 --> 07:50.319
Oh. Yeah, yeah. Of course. Sorry.

07:50.320 --> 07:55.008
This is going to be such
a great week. I can feel it.

08:04.560 --> 08:06.759
Développé.

08:06.760 --> 08:09.639
And sustain your turnout
to the end, girls.

08:09.640 --> 08:12.564
This is about proper placement,
not height.

08:15.360 --> 08:17.886
Good. It's Abigail, isn't it?

08:20.760 --> 08:23.491
Does that look like
a nice line to you?

08:25.760 --> 08:28.240
Forget the flourishes.
Concentrate on your technique.

08:35.640 --> 08:40.558
Hey, 'oops' about this morning.
I'm really crap at giving directions.

08:40.559 --> 08:42.639
Tara.

08:42.640 --> 08:44.959
Hey, I've never done these before.

08:44.960 --> 08:48.203
Really? How long
have you been dancing?

09:15.520 --> 09:17.879
I need air.

09:17.880 --> 09:21.039
But it's after 10:00.
You'd be breaking curfew.

09:21.040 --> 09:25.559
Seriously? I'm not allowed outside?

09:25.560 --> 09:29.439
Yeah, Mum.
The girls here are amazing.

09:29.440 --> 09:31.879
Some of them
are stronger than I am,

09:31.880 --> 09:34.999
but that's, you know...
that's to be expected.

09:42.600 --> 09:45.843
Uh-huh. It's definitely everything
I thought it would be.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.799
Can't turn.
Low extensions.

10:01.800 --> 10:03.962
Terrible feet.

10:05.520 --> 10:07.039
Breasts.

10:11.320 --> 10:12.799
Who's that?

10:12.800 --> 10:16.479
Ethan Karamakov.
He's going in to third year.

10:16.480 --> 10:19.599
Are he and Kat together?
Half-brother.

10:19.600 --> 10:22.331
The better half.

10:24.840 --> 10:27.639
Every year,
girls come into this studio

10:27.640 --> 10:30.279
thinking that wanting to dance

10:30.280 --> 10:34.171
is enough to make them dancers.

10:35.520 --> 10:37.879
It isn't.

10:37.880 --> 10:40.360
Does that hurt?

10:41.440 --> 10:42.919
Should it?

10:42.920 --> 10:47.039
Get your head out of the clouds
and start thinking critically.

10:47.040 --> 10:50.799
Hey, Doc! I think he's anorexic.
Katrina...

10:50.800 --> 10:54.279
You have to face
your physical limitations.

10:54.280 --> 10:57.559
Not everyone is born a dancer.

10:57.560 --> 11:00.199
Don't force it.
You'll damage your knee.

11:00.200 --> 11:02.399
I'm not. This is natural.

11:02.400 --> 11:07.400
And prepare yourselves
for a lifetime of hard work,

11:07.560 --> 11:09.847
sacrifice...

11:10.840 --> 11:14.447
and, more often than not,
disappointment.

11:15.560 --> 11:18.291
Ow!

11:19.600 --> 11:23.919
Don't crowd. Don't crowd.
Where does it hurt?

11:23.920 --> 11:25.763
My achilles.

11:28.400 --> 11:30.687
If it's snapped, she's out.

11:34.800 --> 11:37.167
Back to the beginning.

11:38.160 --> 11:41.119
Thank you, Miss Raine.
Thank you.

11:41.120 --> 11:43.999
Thank you, Miss Raine.
Thank you.

11:44.000 --> 11:49.291
Miss Raine? Hi.
Number 45, Tara Webster.

11:50.480 --> 11:52.439
Do you think Georgia's
going to be OK?

11:52.440 --> 11:54.959
I'd be more focused
on my own future if I were you.

11:54.960 --> 11:58.439
Right. See, I don't know
what's wrong with me this week.

11:58.440 --> 12:01.999
It's probably nerves.
I'm not usually this bad.

12:02.000 --> 12:04.765
Webster, isn't it? You're 15?

12:06.960 --> 12:09.799
Your technique is what
we'd expect of a 12-year-old.

12:09.800 --> 12:12.719
Physically, you have potential,
which I assume is why you're here,

12:12.720 --> 12:14.719
but so do a lot of other girls.

12:14.720 --> 12:16.882
I don't think you're ready.

12:29.280 --> 12:34.280
Problem shoulder blades.
Weak ankles.

12:34.400 --> 12:37.688
Behind technically.

12:38.880 --> 12:44.444
At least you can catch up. I need
to be genetically reprogrammed.

12:45.920 --> 12:47.639
Great. You are coming with me.

12:47.640 --> 12:49.159
What? Where?

12:49.160 --> 12:51.159
Third-years are having
a party on the company rooftop.

12:51.160 --> 12:53.039
But I'm not really in a party mood.

12:53.040 --> 12:55.439
Negative, bunhead.
What have you got to lose?

12:55.440 --> 12:57.039
But can I go like this?

12:57.040 --> 12:59.441
Um, no.

13:09.600 --> 13:11.045
Come on!

13:13.560 --> 13:16.484
Have you met Christian?
He's auditioning as well.

13:17.920 --> 13:20.679
Training bra. Didn't recognise you.

13:20.680 --> 13:23.879
What did he just call you?
Nothing.

13:23.880 --> 13:26.121
Hey, Christian!

13:49.160 --> 13:50.650
Ooh, sorry.

13:53.640 --> 13:55.679
Hi.

13:55.680 --> 13:57.799
Kat invited me,
but I'm just going to go.

13:57.800 --> 14:00.079
No, stick around. I'm Ethan.

14:00.080 --> 14:02.719
- I know.
- Hey, who's your friend?

14:02.720 --> 14:06.279
Oh, no way! You're HER.

14:06.280 --> 14:07.799
Who?

14:07.800 --> 14:11.879
This is the newbie who got
undressed in our changing rooms.

14:11.880 --> 14:13.959
- It wasn't like that.
- Brilliant story.

14:13.960 --> 14:15.439
When I heard...
Kat.

14:15.440 --> 14:19.559
I was like, "Wow,
you are practically famous."

14:19.560 --> 14:21.559
But I would never, ever
deliberately do something like that.

14:21.560 --> 14:24.479
All newbies should be more like you.
Bonus points for enthusiasm.

14:27.720 --> 14:30.079
Um, I'm just gonna go.

14:36.480 --> 14:38.847
What did I ever do to you?!

14:42.200 --> 14:44.567
Nice, Kat.
What?

14:47.320 --> 14:49.199
I am never
leaving this room again.

14:49.200 --> 14:51.279
It wasn't meant to be this way.

14:51.280 --> 14:53.359
What way was it meant to be?

14:53.360 --> 14:57.839
I don't know. Like a dream come true.

14:59.840 --> 15:03.239
It's everybody's dream.
No-one's going to hand it to you.

15:03.240 --> 15:06.959
If you want to stand out, you have
to prove that you're special.

15:06.960 --> 15:09.850
I would if I knew how.

15:10.840 --> 15:13.127
I can show you.

15:23.400 --> 15:25.679
In the last week

15:25.680 --> 15:28.479
we've been assessing
your technique in the classroom.

15:28.480 --> 15:31.359
Tomorrow, for your final audition,

15:31.360 --> 15:35.079
we're looking to see
how you perform a real dance,

15:35.080 --> 15:36.839
how you tell a story.

15:36.840 --> 15:39.519
Hey, sorry about last night.
It got a little bit hectic.

15:39.520 --> 15:42.199
The ballet is Karamakov's
'The Ugly Duckling',

15:42.200 --> 15:43.839
and the solo you'll be doing

15:43.840 --> 15:47.287
is when the duck discovers
she is actually a swan.

15:49.960 --> 15:53.159
First group, get ready
to do a run-through.

15:53.160 --> 15:54.879
Front row.

15:54.880 --> 15:57.451
She'll see me.
That's the idea.

15:59.000 --> 16:03.559
On the rare occasion I get nervous,
I picture myself on stage.

16:03.560 --> 16:05.959
You should probably
imagine yourself somewhere.

16:05.960 --> 16:08.719
Failing that, follow me.

17:52.040 --> 17:56.759
Webster, isn't it?
You altered the choreography. Why?

17:56.760 --> 17:59.679
Um, I don't remember.

17:59.680 --> 18:01.603
Abigail.

18:02.600 --> 18:05.039
There was a coldness now.

18:05.040 --> 18:07.919
I want to see
what's beyond the steps.

18:07.920 --> 18:09.968
You could learn something
by watching Tara.

18:11.320 --> 18:13.719
It was surprisingly good.

18:13.720 --> 18:16.200
Next group, get ready.

18:19.440 --> 18:22.079
I was looking for you. Great class.

18:22.080 --> 18:23.959
I need my leotard back.

18:23.960 --> 18:26.839
OK. But do you still
want to practise later?

18:26.840 --> 18:28.842
Guess not.

19:15.280 --> 19:19.080
Hi, sweetheart.
I guess you're not there.

19:20.080 --> 19:24.519
I've been thinking about what you
said about not being strong enough.

19:24.520 --> 19:28.047
Seems to me you've already
forgotten where you come from.

19:30.960 --> 19:35.399
Think of me putting a crop in
during a drought year.

19:35.400 --> 19:40.930
It takes courage to back yourself.
But then, you know that.

19:43.720 --> 19:48.886
Anyway, I feel like
a goose talking into a machine.

19:49.880 --> 19:53.521
'Night, princess. Good luck tomorrow.

20:30.200 --> 20:32.279
I overslept.

20:32.280 --> 20:34.442
I'm not an alarm clock.

20:36.840 --> 20:39.639
Number 45, come with me.

20:39.640 --> 20:41.599
But I'm meant to be last.

20:41.600 --> 20:43.159
We'd like to see you now.

20:43.160 --> 20:45.719
Thank you so much for everything.

20:45.720 --> 20:47.210
Break a leg.

20:53.480 --> 20:57.201
Hello, Tara. We have some questions.

20:58.920 --> 21:01.479
You are aware
it's against school rules

21:01.480 --> 21:04.799
to leave the boarding house
after hours without permission?

21:04.800 --> 21:07.879
You must understand that
we're responsible to your parents,

21:07.880 --> 21:10.919
and, of course, there
is a serious safety issue

21:10.920 --> 21:14.519
which could impact
on the entire academy.

21:14.520 --> 21:17.159
Tara,
an allegation has been made,

21:17.160 --> 21:22.883
and if it's true, we'll have
no choice but to cancel your audition.

21:25.200 --> 21:26.839
They're talking about
breaking curfew.

21:26.840 --> 21:29.127
Why would they
be asking her about that?

21:34.720 --> 21:36.639
Hey, everybody,
call off the witch hunt.

21:36.640 --> 21:38.719
You have something
to contribute, Katrina?

21:38.720 --> 21:41.451
No, she doesn't.
Tara, don't be silly.

21:42.520 --> 21:45.159
Well, Abigail
was snoring last night.

21:45.160 --> 21:47.959
Seriously, that girl needs to do
something about her nasal passages.

21:47.960 --> 21:49.199
Your point?

21:49.200 --> 21:54.200
My point is, Tara
bunked in with me last night.

21:54.240 --> 21:55.890
Really?

21:56.880 --> 21:58.564
Would I lie, sir?

22:02.480 --> 22:04.005
Miss Webster?

22:05.200 --> 22:08.170
Um... I was in Kat's room last night.

22:10.320 --> 22:11.959
Excellent.

22:11.960 --> 22:13.999
Then I'd like to see the solo

22:14.000 --> 22:16.731
that Miss Raine
has been telling me about.

22:20.200 --> 22:22.123
Don't mention it.

22:24.240 --> 22:26.199
Have you warmed up?

22:26.200 --> 22:28.279
Sorry?
Are you ready?

22:28.280 --> 22:30.089
Um...

22:45.640 --> 22:49.087
Somehow I forgot
everything then...

22:57.760 --> 23:00.039
all the things I didn't know,

23:00.040 --> 23:03.726
how there's way more to surviving
in the Academy than just ballet.

23:04.720 --> 23:08.759
I forgot about my audition
and what would come next.

23:08.760 --> 23:10.922
I forgot everything but dancing...

23:11.920 --> 23:13.639
because in that moment

23:13.640 --> 23:17.159
I remembered that just to dance
is all that matters,

23:17.160 --> 23:19.049
and no-one can take that
away from me.

23:22.280 --> 23:28.162
I'm ready for the Dance Academy.
At least, I think I am.
