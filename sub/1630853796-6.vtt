00:26.985 --> 00:28.570
Stay off your feet.

00:28.653 --> 00:31.531
No, that's not really a thing anymore.

00:31.614 --> 00:34.826
It's fine to be active.
It's good, actually.

00:34.909 --> 00:38.955
As long as you're eating properly,
staying hydrated, you can exercise.

00:39.039 --> 00:41.875
Would you consider yourself
a generally healthy person?

00:42.584 --> 00:43.585
Compared to what?

00:45.503 --> 00:47.338
You've got some anxiety around this.

00:47.422 --> 00:48.298
That's normal,

00:48.965 --> 00:52.719
but it's helpful to try to minimize stress
during your pregnancy.

00:53.636 --> 00:57.432
I find a lot of my patients benefit
from relaxation techniques,

00:57.515 --> 01:00.226
guided meditation, breathing exercises.

01:00.310 --> 01:02.145
What about when this thing
actually gets here?

01:02.228 --> 01:03.897
Is there a breathing exercise for that?

01:06.149 --> 01:08.151
We're hardwired to do this.

01:08.818 --> 01:10.028
You're going to be a great mom.

01:12.655 --> 01:13.823
How would you know that?

01:16.618 --> 01:18.036
How the fuck would you know that?

01:19.204 --> 01:20.830
You're basing that on… on…

01:21.706 --> 01:23.083
On what, my weight?

01:23.958 --> 01:25.043
My blood pressure?

01:25.710 --> 01:27.670
How the fuck would you know
what kind of mother I'm gonna be?

01:27.754 --> 01:30.256
What if… what if I don't even want
this thing?

01:30.340 --> 01:31.216
You ever think about that?

01:31.299 --> 01:33.760
-Of course, I didn't mean to--
-Breathing exercises.

01:33.843 --> 01:35.929
I just meant for you
to take care of yourself.

01:36.012 --> 01:37.430
-Obviously the decision is--
-Take care of myself?

01:37.514 --> 01:40.892
What does that even mean?
Do you hear yourself?

02:29.399 --> 02:33.820
Liv! Come back here, querida.
Come back here right now!

02:44.205 --> 02:45.206
Dad?

02:47.375 --> 02:50.420
It's okay, Liv. I'm still here.

02:56.968 --> 02:57.886
See?

02:59.345 --> 03:00.597
I'm right here.

03:01.681 --> 03:02.765
I promise.

03:27.832 --> 03:29.417
I love you.

03:35.882 --> 03:36.966
-Liv.

03:38.218 --> 03:39.761
Liv, come on. You got to get up.

03:40.553 --> 03:41.888
Nope, we're not doing that.

03:41.971 --> 03:44.349
Come on. It's you and me, kid.

03:45.058 --> 03:46.351
Time to start our day.

03:48.811 --> 03:49.812
Get up, Liv.

03:50.688 --> 03:52.065
You have to keep on moving.

03:53.233 --> 03:55.985
You have to walk… or you'll die.

05:01.217 --> 05:03.011
Rises in the East.

05:03.094 --> 05:04.804
Sets in the West.

05:05.388 --> 05:07.140
Rises in the East.

05:09.142 --> 05:10.518
Sets in the West.

05:12.353 --> 05:13.354
North.

05:13.896 --> 05:15.231
I'm going North.

05:29.787 --> 05:31.414
It's impossible.

05:33.249 --> 05:34.334
Impossible?

05:38.713 --> 05:41.007
It's not impossible.

05:42.717 --> 05:43.801
How far have you gotten?

05:44.677 --> 05:46.095
It's too hard.

05:48.598 --> 05:50.224
How do you eat an elephant?

05:52.852 --> 05:54.228
How do you eat an elephant?

05:55.229 --> 05:56.481
One bite at a time.

06:11.829 --> 06:12.997
One bite at a time.

07:01.587 --> 07:05.258
Then you're going to pull the corners.
Yeah.

07:05.341 --> 07:07.135
And smooth it out.

07:08.177 --> 07:10.888
And then here,
what you're going to do is fold this part,

07:11.431 --> 07:13.015
make it nice and smooth.

07:16.185 --> 07:17.145
Very good.

07:36.622 --> 07:37.832
We're gonna be late.

07:40.042 --> 07:42.211
I'll just take this. Right.

07:53.431 --> 07:54.515
North.

07:58.352 --> 07:59.687
North.

08:29.550 --> 08:31.761
-Liv?

08:31.844 --> 08:33.721
-What have I told you about--
-I'm sorry.

08:35.723 --> 08:37.475
About working with mixed media.

08:40.686 --> 08:41.938
Try some red.

12:06.726 --> 12:09.061
Thought I'd walk with you a bit.
That okay?

12:10.688 --> 12:13.149
I don't know how much walking
I have left in me.

12:14.316 --> 12:18.112
-Four, five days maybe, and then--
-Don't think about that.

12:19.530 --> 12:20.614
Just keep going.

12:21.782 --> 12:23.284
It's all I can think about.

12:26.704 --> 12:27.955
Dying out here.

12:29.790 --> 12:31.208
Just keep moving forward.

12:31.792 --> 12:34.086
Long as you can do that,
you still got a shot.

12:39.049 --> 12:40.384
Liv, don't think about it.

12:41.385 --> 12:42.636
Think about something else.

12:51.145 --> 12:52.229
You could've told me…

12:53.647 --> 12:54.732
that you were pregnant.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.027
I didn't know.

12:59.779 --> 13:01.489
After, I mean after you knew.

13:05.659 --> 13:07.077
What difference would it make?

13:09.497 --> 13:12.291
"Two roads diverged in a yellow wood."

13:12.374 --> 13:14.710
-Danny.
-Fine, we'll skip the Frost.

13:18.547 --> 13:20.007
Who knows what difference?

13:21.175 --> 13:22.092
Maybe none.

13:24.303 --> 13:25.638
You could've told me, that's all.

13:27.556 --> 13:28.891
I was always more of a…

13:30.059 --> 13:31.393
Langston Hughes gal.

13:34.563 --> 13:36.440
"Holding you is difficult today."

13:38.609 --> 13:40.986
"You feel sharp and jagged."

13:43.405 --> 13:45.407
"All shoulder blades and elbows."

13:48.744 --> 13:51.705
"How I would love to round your edges."

13:54.333 --> 13:58.337
"To make you smooth
in my rock tumbler heart."

14:03.926 --> 14:05.010
That's Hughes?

14:07.429 --> 14:08.681
That's one of my dad's.

14:19.483 --> 14:21.068
I think I'd be a good dad.

14:23.028 --> 14:24.321
Of course, you do.

14:26.323 --> 14:29.869
You suffer from chronic overconfidence.

14:33.706 --> 14:35.875
I mean, what's to know?

14:37.001 --> 14:39.837
You hug them, you tell them you love them,

14:40.880 --> 14:43.549
you make them feel like nothing
is ever gonna hurt them.

14:45.217 --> 14:46.218
But it will.

14:47.177 --> 14:48.971
Sure, you lie.

14:50.973 --> 14:53.142
I don't believe in lying
to the people you love.

14:54.393 --> 14:55.561
Lies pile up.

14:57.897 --> 15:02.610
The truth… is hard,
but that's all we've got.

15:02.693 --> 15:03.861
You want some truth?

15:05.779 --> 15:07.573
I think you'd be a good mom, too.

15:10.618 --> 15:11.493
Yeah?

15:12.036 --> 15:14.747
Besides, I've known you, what?
Almost a year now?

15:16.540 --> 15:17.917
Yeah. Sounds about right.

15:18.500 --> 15:22.338
That whole time, I've never once known you
to do anything half-assed.

15:24.089 --> 15:26.675
Raising a kid seems like
a weird thing to start on.

15:28.552 --> 15:30.429
Just some things are out of our control.

15:30.512 --> 15:34.099
Yeah. For all of us. Isn't it great?

15:49.198 --> 15:50.282
Could've told me.

15:52.368 --> 15:53.702
You could have told me anything.

15:56.664 --> 15:57.915
I would have listened.

16:00.918 --> 16:01.919
I know.

16:30.406 --> 16:31.907
Why didn't you tell me…

16:34.368 --> 16:35.703
about the postcards?

16:40.290 --> 16:41.458
You lied to me.

16:46.171 --> 16:48.590
All those times
when I asked you where Mom was

16:48.674 --> 16:49.925
and you said you didn't know.

16:54.888 --> 16:56.056
Those were for me.

16:59.101 --> 17:00.602
She was reaching for me.

17:06.525 --> 17:07.693
This place.

17:09.445 --> 17:10.612
These walls.

17:12.740 --> 17:13.824
These rooms.

17:16.160 --> 17:17.244
All the love,

17:18.954 --> 17:19.955
all the pain.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.754
We… stayed in it.

17:29.548 --> 17:30.632
And we waited.

17:32.634 --> 17:34.970
She knew exactly where we were.

17:39.975 --> 17:41.602
Those words weren't for you.

17:45.981 --> 17:47.149
They were for her.

17:51.570 --> 17:53.072
And you gave her enough.

17:55.449 --> 17:57.242
That wasn't for you to decide.

18:01.789 --> 18:03.999
There's a difference between being left,

18:06.585 --> 18:07.920
and being forgotten.

18:24.853 --> 18:29.149
Picture yourself
in a vast endless forest.

18:30.609 --> 18:32.861
Nothing and no one around.

18:34.321 --> 18:35.864
Just the trees.

18:38.117 --> 18:39.201
The Earth.

18:41.245 --> 18:42.329
The wind.

18:44.206 --> 18:45.290
The water.

18:47.334 --> 18:50.671
Feel yourself alone in this place.

18:53.715 --> 18:56.760
A living breathing part of it.

18:59.346 --> 19:00.597
Drinking it in.

19:02.808 --> 19:04.476
You are only your body.

19:06.854 --> 19:08.856
You are only your breath.

19:10.566 --> 19:13.694
Feel the landscape moving through you,

19:15.445 --> 19:17.614
returning you to yourself.

19:20.117 --> 19:22.202
And as you move through it,

19:22.911 --> 19:25.247
you are also a part of it.

19:26.623 --> 19:29.209
You are alive inside your body.

19:31.461 --> 19:33.881
You are alive inside your breath.

19:36.758 --> 19:38.010
You are blood.

19:40.137 --> 19:41.555
You are bone.

19:44.308 --> 19:45.726
You are flesh.

19:47.978 --> 19:49.938
You are right where you belong.

19:53.233 --> 19:54.693
You are home.

19:58.697 --> 20:00.324
You are home.

20:04.912 --> 20:06.246
You are home.

20:51.458 --> 20:52.793
It's okay, Dad.

20:55.629 --> 20:57.589
-You're so tired.

21:02.469 --> 21:03.804
It's okay to rest.

21:06.390 --> 21:08.183
You should rest for a while.

21:13.897 --> 21:15.399
It's okay to let go.

21:18.443 --> 21:20.404
It's okay.

21:21.446 --> 21:22.781
I'm here.

21:30.706 --> 21:34.334
It's okay, Liv. It's okay.

21:40.007 --> 21:41.258
I'm right here.

21:44.720 --> 21:45.971
I promise.

22:45.739 --> 22:46.823
Cars.

22:49.451 --> 22:50.535
Cars!

24:28.133 --> 24:29.301
It's nice here.

24:30.719 --> 24:31.720
Peaceful.

24:35.557 --> 24:36.975
Your mother loved nature.

24:39.394 --> 24:41.229
I never made much time for it.

24:46.568 --> 24:47.652
Maybe I should have.

24:52.282 --> 24:54.451
She'd drag us on those hikes.
Do you remember?

24:55.076 --> 24:57.871
And get in the car and drive for too long,

24:58.455 --> 25:02.834
trench through some god-awful path
that was barely a path.

25:04.669 --> 25:08.256
Trying to find some secret
something she'd heard about somewhere.

25:09.591 --> 25:12.177
Both of us complaining the whole time.

25:15.180 --> 25:16.181
And then we'd get there.

25:17.390 --> 25:18.808
And she would always be right.

25:20.977 --> 25:22.145
It was always beautiful.

25:24.564 --> 25:26.441
And then we'd all go back home again.

25:28.777 --> 25:32.614
I can feel her here, in all of this.

25:34.699 --> 25:36.868
Maybe that's what she was doing
this whole time.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.080
Looking for a place like this.

25:42.916 --> 25:44.000
I hope she found it.

25:48.505 --> 25:49.506
I thought…

25:54.344 --> 25:55.595
If I could find her…

26:01.184 --> 26:02.811
If I could look her in the eyes.

26:09.067 --> 26:10.318
That's stupid.

26:12.279 --> 26:13.780
None of it makes any sense.

26:15.282 --> 26:17.784
It was a little impulsive,
I'll give you that.

26:18.493 --> 26:22.330
But, then,
you've always been a little impulsive.

26:23.915 --> 26:25.875
Can't imagine where you got that from.

26:31.881 --> 26:32.882
Am I like her?

26:40.682 --> 26:41.683
Yeah.

26:43.059 --> 26:44.185
In your eyes,

26:46.021 --> 26:47.355
in your smile.

26:53.486 --> 26:55.363
But most of you
has nothing to do with her.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.826
You know why you became a lawyer?

27:01.745 --> 27:03.204
Because I like fighting.

27:05.332 --> 27:06.833
Because you're like answers.

27:08.293 --> 27:09.294
Order.

27:10.879 --> 27:12.631
You didn't have much of that growing up.

27:14.174 --> 27:16.426
You crave a world
that's black and white.

27:18.094 --> 27:20.388
But the world's not interested
in what you want.

27:22.182 --> 27:24.809
It's been chaos since before we got here.

27:26.061 --> 27:28.021
And it'll be chaos after we're gone.

27:29.648 --> 27:32.108
And if there's an order to any of this,

27:32.859 --> 27:34.277
it's invisible to us.

27:34.861 --> 27:36.404
So, what if you're like her?

27:38.073 --> 27:39.032
You're also like me.

27:40.325 --> 27:41.576
You stick around.

27:43.745 --> 27:44.788
You're also like you.

27:46.122 --> 27:47.207
Determined.

27:49.000 --> 27:50.710
Make different choices.

27:57.634 --> 28:01.888
-Hey, there's nothing wrong with you, Liv.

28:03.056 --> 28:04.474
You didn't do anything wrong.

28:07.227 --> 28:08.728
You were just a little girl.

28:11.606 --> 28:13.942
You're just… a little lost.

28:15.110 --> 28:16.111
That's all.

28:17.112 --> 28:18.279
And tired.

28:21.408 --> 28:23.118
Maybe you should rest a little while.

28:25.620 --> 28:27.622
This looks like the perfect place
to do that.

28:31.960 --> 28:33.753
I wonder if I would have been ready…

28:37.632 --> 28:38.800
to be a mom.

28:41.344 --> 28:43.012
In my experience…

28:44.222 --> 28:46.015
it's not something you prepare for.

28:47.225 --> 28:48.893
It's something you give over to.

28:50.979 --> 28:53.356
You just jump in…

28:54.691 --> 28:56.276
and see where it takes you.

29:00.280 --> 29:01.364
It's nice here.

29:03.575 --> 29:04.993
I think I'll stay for a while.

29:17.255 --> 29:18.923
Sometimes, there's no answers.

29:19.758 --> 29:22.093
Sometimes, there's just goodbye.
