<b>Evans /Person of the Land      Pursall /Person of the Land</b>

00:04.940 --> 00:06.610
They're all People of the Land.

<b>Jessica /Person of the Land                 Belna /Person of the Land</b>

00:08.020 --> 00:09.150
Sleeping?

00:09.530 --> 00:10.990
They're all asleep!

00:11.700 --> 00:12.780
Are you okay?

00:13.200 --> 00:14.530
What happened?

00:14.530 --> 00:17.780
Sh-Shining wings...

00:18.790 --> 00:20.830
Shining wings?

01:52.550 --> 01:58.090
<b>Guild Hall/ Cafeteria B

01:53.710 --> 01:58.090
The fifty-four People of the Land who fell 
asleep are being kept at the guild hall.

01:58.090 --> 02:00.350
The same phenomenon occurred in Maihama.

02:00.350 --> 02:03.060
Lord Sergiatte is still asleep and won't wake up.

02:04.140 --> 02:06.980
Silver Sword says Susukino is safe.

02:07.270 --> 02:10.150
Then only People of the Land fall asleep?

02:10.560 --> 02:11.610
Yes.

02:11.020 --> 02:15.690
<b>Belna /Person of the Land</b>

02:11.610 --> 02:16.030
Their MP falls to zero and doesn't 
recover fast enough naturally.

02:15.690 --> 02:18.660
<b>Belna /Person of the Land</b>

02:16.030 --> 02:18.660
So their MP is being continually drained?

02:19.280 --> 02:25.120
Eyewitnesses suggest it's due to a 
moth-like monster with shining wings.

02:25.120 --> 02:27.410
A moth spirit, probably...

02:27.790 --> 02:31.670
There wasn't any monster like that in the game.

02:32.590 --> 02:34.960
For now, it appears our best move

02:34.960 --> 02:37.130
is to keep investigating and 
to strengthen our defenses.

02:37.130 --> 02:38.880
What about Shibuya?

02:38.880 --> 02:39.970
Shibuya?

02:40.470 --> 02:43.350
Regan told us that the remains of the

02:43.350 --> 02:45.890
broadcasting station in Shibuya 
may still be functional.

02:46.350 --> 02:48.390
Shouldn't we investigate that immediately?

02:48.890 --> 02:51.150
And ignore the moth spirit?

02:51.690 --> 02:56.110
It may seem cold, but if only People 
of the Land are falling asleepâ€”

02:56.110 --> 02:57.150
No way!

02:57.530 --> 03:00.990
That's just how much stress the 
adventurers are under right now!

03:02.240 --> 03:03.700
The Royal Guard's rampage.

03:03.700 --> 03:05.330
The flavor text coming true.

03:05.330 --> 03:06.870
And now this...

03:07.750 --> 03:10.330
And there are signs of impending 
war with People of the Land.

03:10.960 --> 03:13.500
We don't have the energy to 
spend on anything else.

03:15.500 --> 03:18.010
I do understand how you feel, but...

03:18.010 --> 03:23.010
Yeah. Even if we can go home, 
it's not going to happen right away.

03:23.010 --> 03:24.600
Right, Shiroe?

03:24.600 --> 03:26.010
Yes...

03:28.140 --> 03:30.350
But that doesn't mean we can do nothing.

03:30.890 --> 03:32.980
Let's keep an eye on the situation 
and see what we can do.

03:34.650 --> 03:40.530
<b>Sleep of the Eternal Moth</b>

03:37.070 --> 03:38.440
Sleep of the Eternal Moth.

03:41.280 --> 03:43.110
There aren't many people today.

03:43.700 --> 03:45.910
Yeah, with the moth spirit running around...

03:55.040 --> 03:56.290
Tohya.

03:56.290 --> 03:57.880
What did Chief Nyanta say?

03:58.250 --> 04:02.340
He's going to patrol with us tonight.

04:02.630 --> 04:03.510
All right.

04:03.930 --> 04:08.930
The People of the Land who fell asleep 
show no signs of waking up yet.

04:09.270 --> 04:10.350
I'm worried about them.

04:12.270 --> 04:13.850
I'm going home.

04:19.940 --> 04:22.360
Are you thinking about your home?

04:22.530 --> 04:23.610
Rudy?

04:23.910 --> 04:29.620
Even if we're apart, I don't think 
our relationship will change.

04:30.330 --> 04:33.120
I might not be able to see you anymore.

04:33.540 --> 04:37.130
Even so, if you have a place 
to go home to, you should.

04:37.710 --> 04:42.300
There are some people who can't, 
even if they want to.

04:43.720 --> 04:44.760
Rudy...

04:49.060 --> 04:51.850
Okay, we're going to head out on patrol.

04:51.850 --> 04:52.640
Yeah.

04:52.850 --> 04:55.560
Chief, take care of them.

04:55.560 --> 04:56.310
Shiro!

04:57.190 --> 04:58.440
Shiroe! Look!

04:58.730 --> 05:00.230
They're here! They're here!

05:00.230 --> 05:01.480
A whole swarm of moths!

05:03.360 --> 05:05.570
<b>Eternal Moth</b>

05:03.860 --> 05:04.740
Eternal moths?

05:09.620 --> 05:10.830
So many of them!

05:11.290 --> 05:12.540
This is bad.

05:13.000 --> 05:15.040
Could this be...

05:18.130 --> 05:19.920
I hate bugs!

05:27.840 --> 05:29.300
What the hell is this?

05:30.060 --> 05:33.480
The shed scales are passing through 
the city's defense magic?

05:33.480 --> 05:34.890
Just draw their attention!

05:34.890 --> 05:36.730
Push them outside the walls!

05:37.060 --> 05:39.730
The southwest side's about to be breached...

05:39.730 --> 05:41.440
Team 2, cover them!

05:41.440 --> 05:42.480
Roger!

05:42.650 --> 05:45.490
Don't you have to go to your wife, Demi?

05:46.200 --> 05:49.240
I'm having her lead People of the Land to safety.

05:49.240 --> 05:53.750
I won't let a single one of them into our town!

05:56.040 --> 05:58.170
All the Royal Guards fell asleep?

05:58.170 --> 05:59.630
That was unexpected.

06:00.040 --> 06:02.590
An attack from outside the zone...

06:03.130 --> 06:05.050
Get the People of the Land to safety!

06:05.050 --> 06:05.920
Right!

06:05.920 --> 06:07.880
This is going to be bad.

06:08.430 --> 06:10.260
Marielle, there are more here!

06:10.260 --> 06:11.850
This is bad!

06:11.050 --> 06:13.890
<b>Bibiko /Adventurer     Tarosa /Adventurer

Juggler /Adventurer     Stacy /Adventurer</b>

06:12.140 --> 06:13.970
Even adventurers?

06:14.140 --> 06:16.230
It isn't only People of the Land?

06:16.230 --> 06:17.980
It's dangerous to be outside!

06:17.980 --> 06:21.400
Everyone, get inside the guild building!

06:26.190 --> 06:29.160
At last, adventurers have also started to fall, huh?

06:29.660 --> 06:34.160
It seems that if shed scales get 
on you, you fall asleep.

06:34.490 --> 06:39.080
It may be that your Psyche, your MP, 
is drained from your body.

06:35.080 --> 06:38.960
<b>Psyche</b>

06:39.080 --> 06:41.670
Perhaps we should call it "Missing Psyche Disease."

06:40.080 --> 06:41.670
<b>Missing Psyche Disease</b>

06:41.670 --> 06:44.550
But some people are fine.

06:44.550 --> 06:49.680
We don't know the difference between those 
who fall asleep and those who don't, but...

06:49.680 --> 06:51.680
You don't die, do you?

06:52.010 --> 06:52.680
Right.

06:53.180 --> 06:56.220
If you die, you can revive at the Cathedral.

06:56.640 --> 06:59.690
But once you fall asleep...

07:00.270 --> 07:01.270
How did it go?

07:01.270 --> 07:04.440
I've found the eternal moths' nest, Shiro.

07:04.860 --> 07:06.940
Where is it?

07:06.650 --> 07:10.410
<b>Town of Shibuya

07:06.940 --> 07:08.030
In Shibuya.

07:08.740 --> 07:10.030
It's really bad.

07:10.910 --> 07:13.910
The player town of Shibuya 
has turned into a dungeon.

07:14.370 --> 07:16.410
And where is the moths' nest?

07:16.410 --> 07:18.460
In the remains of the Shibuya broadcast building.

07:18.460 --> 07:20.540
It's a raid zone.

07:21.000 --> 07:24.540
Its new name is the "Calling Fortress."

07:21.750 --> 07:24.920
<b>Calling Fortress

07:26.670 --> 07:28.420
What's this?

07:28.420 --> 07:32.140
It's a prototype based on the 
game's capture functions.

07:32.140 --> 07:36.680
But if you use it for more than 
ten minutes, it explodes.

07:37.520 --> 07:39.680
Until last week, it was completely normal.

07:39.680 --> 07:43.190
It seems there's a seal on the entrance.

07:43.560 --> 07:46.940
Is it possible that monster eggs 
or an eternal moth cocoon fell

07:46.940 --> 07:51.450
from the moon and was drawn by 
that device you call an antenna?

07:51.820 --> 07:53.700
From the moon in the sky?

07:54.200 --> 07:57.370
On the moon is a community of Observers

07:57.370 --> 07:59.200
whom we're trying to contact.

07:59.830 --> 08:03.210
And the monsters called "Geniuses" 
were there, as well, right?

08:03.710 --> 08:07.960
So are those eternal moths a type of Genius?

08:07.960 --> 08:10.010
Then why would they want everyone's MP?

08:10.630 --> 08:13.720
Roe 2's letter did say that the Geniuses

08:13.720 --> 08:16.470
are collecting something they called "empathions."

08:17.350 --> 08:19.520
I didn't understand what they were, though.

08:20.430 --> 08:22.560
Is it MP?

08:23.060 --> 08:24.980
That's highly likely.

08:24.980 --> 08:28.690
The eternal moths appeared at the same 
time yesterday and the day before.

08:29.150 --> 08:31.490
The same time the moon rises.

08:31.900 --> 08:34.860
18:22, precisely.

08:34.860 --> 08:38.700
A third wave is certain to come tonight.

08:39.040 --> 08:42.710
The first time, it was People of the Land, 
and the second, it was adventurers, too.

08:43.040 --> 08:44.960
Their numbers are increasing.

08:44.960 --> 08:49.340
To prevent damages, we'll probably 
have to destroy the antenna.

08:49.550 --> 08:52.340
But that's the only thing in Yamato that...

08:52.340 --> 08:53.800
Yes.

08:53.800 --> 08:55.430
And according to legend,

08:55.430 --> 08:59.470
an antenna is necessary for 
communication with the stars.

08:59.850 --> 09:04.730
If we destroy it, Shiroe's plan may 
be impossible to execute.

09:04.730 --> 09:06.150
No way.

09:06.440 --> 09:08.020
What about the other servers?

09:08.020 --> 09:09.150
We don't know.

09:09.820 --> 09:13.190
We have barely any information 
on the foreign servers.

09:13.610 --> 09:18.240
Even if the facilities do exist somewhere 
else, they may be nonfunctional.

09:18.240 --> 09:19.870
But if we don't do something,

09:19.870 --> 09:23.200
we'll have even bigger problems.

09:23.500 --> 09:26.000
Maybe we'll just have to give up this time.

09:28.290 --> 09:30.750
So what do we do?

09:31.550 --> 09:33.590
The Calling Fortress is a raid zone.

09:34.050 --> 09:35.930
Even if it appears to be in front of us,

09:35.930 --> 09:38.010
it's impossible to attack from the outside.

09:38.760 --> 09:42.890
We'll need to go inside from the main 
entrance, and head for the goal.

09:44.480 --> 09:46.520
We'll dispatch a raid team immediately.

09:46.690 --> 09:52.530
<b>Shiroe      Naotsugu      Tetra

10:03.410 --> 10:06.790
<b>Shouryuu     Isami     Kurinon</b>

10:07.000 --> 10:09.710
Some of them don't have very high levels.

10:09.710 --> 10:13.300
I selected them from people who didn't fall 
asleep when exposed to the moths' scales.

10:13.840 --> 10:18.050
Of course, there's no guarantee 
they'll withstand the next attack.

10:19.180 --> 10:21.550
You don't want to investigate the fortress first?

10:21.890 --> 10:23.310
There's no time.

10:23.310 --> 10:26.060
So we're taking a gamble, huh?

10:27.140 --> 10:29.100
Sorry to keep you waiting!

10:29.810 --> 10:31.480
You're coming, too, old man?

10:31.480 --> 10:37.780
Yes. Apparently, there's a special seal 
on the Calling Fortress's entrance.

10:37.780 --> 10:41.200
Shiroe asked me to release it.

10:41.450 --> 10:43.200
That's not the only reason, right?

10:43.450 --> 10:47.460
This situation is a first in the world's history.

10:48.080 --> 10:50.710
As the bearer of the Miral Lake name,

10:50.710 --> 10:53.290
I have a responsibility to see it through.

10:53.290 --> 10:57.670
We may not be able to protect you.

10:57.670 --> 11:00.010
Don't worry.

11:00.010 --> 11:02.720
I'll take care of myself.

11:03.640 --> 11:06.470
Facilities across Yamato have been knocked out.

11:07.060 --> 11:09.230
I've heard what's happening in Shibuya, too.

11:09.730 --> 11:14.190
I shall see what decision you adventurers make.

11:14.980 --> 11:16.900
Take care of Akihabara for me.

11:17.320 --> 11:19.150
You take care, as well.

11:19.860 --> 11:20.910
Einz...

11:20.910 --> 11:21.490
Yes?

11:22.120 --> 11:23.370
I'll believe

11:23.370 --> 11:25.540
that you're a member of the Round Table, too.

11:29.210 --> 11:33.750
Our target is the raid zone deep in the 
Shibuya Dungeon, the Calling Fortress.

11:34.380 --> 11:37.760
We will destroy the antenna there to stop 
the spread of the eternal moths,

11:38.340 --> 11:39.920
and then wipe them out.

11:46.930 --> 11:49.480
Let's finish this by moonrise!

11:59.490 --> 12:02.110
There are six hours until moonrise.

12:03.620 --> 12:06.280
Eight moon rabbits from the old Dougenzaka area.

12:03.620 --> 12:07.740
<b>Moon Rabbit</b>

12:06.280 --> 12:08.370
Average level 91!

12:08.370 --> 12:10.790
Keep pressure on them while heading 
toward Old Center Street.

12:10.790 --> 12:14.330
Six rabbits from two o'clock, 
and six from ten o'clock.

12:14.670 --> 12:16.130
<i>This is just so strange.</i>

12:16.420 --> 12:20.300
<i>This happens right when we start thinking 
about communicating with the moon?</i>

12:20.300 --> 12:21.170
Shiro!

12:21.170 --> 12:22.380
From ahead of us, too!

12:22.380 --> 12:23.300
Nine more!

12:24.090 --> 12:26.180
Party 2, draw them to the front.

12:26.930 --> 12:29.310
Party 1, front line, head to the front and...

12:29.310 --> 12:31.690
No, split the group to the rear!

12:33.900 --> 12:36.770
Richou and Tohya, support group 1!

12:36.770 --> 12:37.820
Roger!

12:37.820 --> 12:40.690
Yuzuko, Olive, support each party.

12:41.150 --> 12:43.320
Forward, group 4, secure a path!

12:43.320 --> 12:44.280
Understood.

12:44.280 --> 12:45.990
Minori, was it?

12:45.990 --> 12:47.740
She's so cute!

12:47.740 --> 12:50.950
It's called "Abbreviated Full-Power 
Controlled Combat."

12:50.950 --> 12:52.960
She learned it directly from Shiroe!

12:52.960 --> 12:55.380
There are just too many!

12:55.380 --> 12:56.630
Here.

12:56.630 --> 12:58.750
I'll heal you, Naotsugu.

12:59.670 --> 13:03.680
Tetra's healing will work 
better than hers, Naotsugu!

13:03.680 --> 13:06.550
<i>If they know what we're doing, 
this is exactly what they want.</i>

13:06.550 --> 13:08.010
Olive, get back!

13:08.220 --> 13:10.680
No, cover Richou from the right!

13:11.520 --> 13:12.230
Whoops...

13:12.230 --> 13:13.180
Shiroe?

13:13.180 --> 13:14.890
Ah, sorry!

13:14.890 --> 13:15.810
Shiroe!

13:15.810 --> 13:17.020
More enemies!

13:17.020 --> 13:18.900
New enemies incoming from eight o'clock.

13:18.900 --> 13:20.190
Sh-Shiroe!

13:20.190 --> 13:21.440
A minotaur!

13:21.440 --> 13:22.900
That's a surprise I'm not at all happy about!

13:22.900 --> 13:25.030
This is an ambush!

13:25.320 --> 13:27.240
You're kidding me!

13:27.570 --> 13:31.200
<i>We may really lose our hope to get home.</i>

13:31.200 --> 13:32.290
Shiroe?

13:32.290 --> 13:34.160
Two minotaurs!

13:34.160 --> 13:35.080
Your orders!

13:35.750 --> 13:39.420
Center around parties 2 and 4 
and break through Old Spain-zaka!

13:39.420 --> 13:41.340
Whoa, there... Take care.

13:41.340 --> 13:42.420
Nyanta...

13:42.760 --> 13:45.550
Wow, they're all monsters I've never seen.

13:45.550 --> 13:47.470
This is very interesting...

13:50.010 --> 13:51.390
Watch out, old guy!

13:52.180 --> 13:54.810
Party 1, fall back and focus on healing!

13:55.520 --> 14:00.570
<i>But we can't abandon this world, 
or the People of the Land, to this state.</i>

14:00.820 --> 14:02.900
Maintain formation and keep going forward.

14:02.900 --> 14:05.320
No, right at the next corner!

14:05.450 --> 14:07.200
This is a mess.

14:07.200 --> 14:08.990
This isn't like him...

14:08.990 --> 14:11.450
We didn't have time to investigate in advance.

14:11.450 --> 14:12.950
It can't be helped.

14:12.950 --> 14:13.830
Still...

14:14.250 --> 14:15.580
This is pathetic.

14:17.040 --> 14:19.790
My lord respects him as the 
Tea Party's famous strategist.

14:19.790 --> 14:22.250
I wondered how good he was...

14:25.550 --> 14:27.970
This is the Calling Fortress.

14:28.430 --> 14:30.470
Four hours and seven minutes left.

14:30.760 --> 14:33.470
This is a complicated seal...

14:33.810 --> 14:35.770
Okay, here you go.

14:36.180 --> 14:37.940
Nice panties!

14:37.940 --> 14:40.440
Way to go, skeleton-guy!

14:40.440 --> 14:42.480
Oh, I know. I'm awesome.

14:42.860 --> 14:43.730
Let's go.

14:43.730 --> 14:44.730
Yeah.

14:45.360 --> 14:49.070
Our phantom-beast scouts have 
given us some information,

14:49.070 --> 14:52.990
but as we head for the top, 
we'll confirm the situation on each floor.

14:53.490 --> 14:57.540
Each party's back ranks will keep their distance, 
to prepare for the unexpected.

14:58.420 --> 15:00.500
<i>Votive Sword Kogarasumaru!</i>

15:03.130 --> 15:06.260
Man, I can't see Sou...

15:06.260 --> 15:08.260
More enemies! Six rabbits!

15:08.260 --> 15:10.890
I won't let the captain be the only one to fight!

15:11.590 --> 15:13.350
<i>Samurai's Challenge!</i>

15:13.350 --> 15:16.430
Fighting girls are so great...

15:16.430 --> 15:18.100
The shining sweat!

15:18.100 --> 15:20.190
The West Wind gets along well, don't they?

15:20.560 --> 15:22.690
We're partners. Of course we do.

15:23.730 --> 15:25.440
I love it!

15:25.780 --> 15:27.110
Huh?!

15:27.860 --> 15:28.900
Are you okay?

15:28.900 --> 15:29.700
Yes.

15:29.700 --> 15:30.950
Don't worry about me.

15:31.360 --> 15:33.580
All these corridors look the same...

15:33.580 --> 15:35.700
It's literally a labyrinth!

15:35.700 --> 15:37.200
A dead end?

15:37.200 --> 15:38.830
It's sealed with cocoons!

15:39.080 --> 15:40.870
Same over here, my lord!

15:40.870 --> 15:42.580
I can't see past it!

15:41.620 --> 15:42.580
Shiroe!

15:42.920 --> 15:45.090
The west corridor is overflowing with moon rabbits!

15:45.210 --> 15:50.470
<b>Fragrant Olive     Nazuna     Kurinon 
Minori     Yuzuko</b>

15:45.800 --> 15:49.130
<i>The way we're running through 
MP could prove fatal.</i>

15:49.130 --> 15:49.970
<i>But...</i>

15:51.010 --> 15:52.470
We'll head back down for now.

15:54.300 --> 15:55.850
After coming this far?

15:55.850 --> 15:56.850
Shiro?

15:57.060 --> 15:58.850
Head down and into the central courtyard!

16:01.270 --> 16:05.020
As long as we defend the two exits, 
we can hold our position here.

16:05.520 --> 16:07.780
We'll take turns recovering MP.

16:07.780 --> 16:10.030
If we only had a safe zone...

16:10.700 --> 16:12.570
The mob levels are high.

16:12.990 --> 16:14.820
This is tougher than I expected.

16:15.620 --> 16:16.830
Shiroe!

16:17.490 --> 16:18.750
A minotaur!

16:18.750 --> 16:21.000
Another set of two!

16:21.000 --> 16:23.000
Six black ogres from above!

16:23.000 --> 16:24.790
Twelve moon rabbits from above!

16:24.790 --> 16:26.250
Split up and get ready!

16:26.960 --> 16:28.590
No time to rest, huh?

16:28.590 --> 16:31.170
Raids are always like this.

16:31.170 --> 16:34.970
Well, ever since I decided to go with 
you, I've been ready for this.

16:34.970 --> 16:37.600
You're always the one at the very front.

16:38.010 --> 16:41.020
You don't think I'm some kind 
of bad luck charm, do you?

16:41.020 --> 16:41.940
You'll make me cry.

16:42.390 --> 16:44.560
I'll make you cry later!

16:44.560 --> 16:45.860
Serara!

16:49.230 --> 16:50.400
Chief!

16:50.400 --> 16:52.070
I-I'm sorry!

16:52.320 --> 16:53.780
No! Tohya!

16:53.780 --> 16:54.950
I can't keep them delayed...

16:55.570 --> 16:58.120
Okay, I'll use an Aura Healâ€”

16:58.700 --> 16:59.790
Hey!

17:00.330 --> 17:02.540
You can't just push an idol awayâ€”

17:02.540 --> 17:04.500
Tetra, heal everyone!

17:04.870 --> 17:06.210
Marielle!

17:06.460 --> 17:08.000
Marielle!

17:09.840 --> 17:11.170
New enemy.

17:11.170 --> 17:13.170
Half-moon venom hydrangea.

17:13.720 --> 17:15.800
Shiroe, we've lost three!

17:15.800 --> 17:17.300
Our MP won't last.

17:17.300 --> 17:18.930
I'm prioritizing Richou's group.

17:18.930 --> 17:20.640
Hang in there somehow!

17:20.640 --> 17:21.930
Roger!

17:22.600 --> 17:24.060
AoE attack!

17:24.060 --> 17:25.560
Everyone split up!

17:25.560 --> 17:27.690
No, use the shrine priestess's four-way barrier!

17:27.690 --> 17:29.400
No one has the MP!

17:33.740 --> 17:34.950
Korou!

17:35.530 --> 17:36.950
Bad status...

17:37.120 --> 17:39.330
Rot! DoT!

17:39.330 --> 17:41.330
It's no good! Our HP won't last, either!

17:41.620 --> 17:43.660
Three lost. Five dead.

17:43.660 --> 17:45.790
We've lost a third in such a short time.

17:46.250 --> 17:48.540
We can't keep going! This is really bad!

17:48.540 --> 17:49.710
Shiro...

17:49.710 --> 17:50.960
Give the order to withdraw!

17:52.210 --> 17:53.090
Shiro!

17:54.220 --> 17:55.090
My lord...

17:58.640 --> 17:59.720
<i>Flip Gate.</i>

18:10.190 --> 18:12.900
Where are we? A studio?

18:11.190 --> 18:19.740
<b>Calling Fortress 
Safe Zone A
Japan Server
Shibuya
Dungeon/ No Monsters
No PvP
Skill Use Restricted
Entry Restrictions/ None
Exit Restrictions/ None</b>

18:12.900 --> 18:16.990
So this is the revive point... 
Not the dungeon's entrance?

18:17.490 --> 18:19.740
Marie, I'm sorry...

18:19.740 --> 18:21.490
I couldn't protect you.

18:21.490 --> 18:23.120
It's fine.

18:23.120 --> 18:26.500
I just fell down the hole and ended up here.

18:26.500 --> 18:27.370
Does it hurt?

18:27.370 --> 18:28.670
Want to see my panties?

18:28.670 --> 18:29.750
No, I'm fine.

18:29.750 --> 18:31.750
It's only a scratch.

18:32.050 --> 18:35.340
Um, thanks for your help back there.

18:36.170 --> 18:37.840
It's fine.

18:37.840 --> 18:40.890
You had more MP left than I did.

18:40.890 --> 18:42.260
I didn't even think about it!

18:42.560 --> 18:44.430
Marielle!

18:42.560 --> 18:46.180
I haven't been on a raid this tough in a long time.

18:44.430 --> 18:46.980
That tickles!

18:46.980 --> 18:48.400
Hey, get away!

18:48.100 --> 18:49.270
Um...

18:50.560 --> 18:51.440
Everyone...

18:52.570 --> 18:53.480
I'm sorry.

18:57.200 --> 18:58.780
Shiroe...

19:03.620 --> 19:04.790
Shiroe?

19:11.840 --> 19:14.050
H-Henrietta?

19:14.340 --> 19:15.380
My lord...

19:24.560 --> 19:26.560
Um, Shiroe...

19:27.020 --> 19:30.150
We're staying in this world!

19:31.400 --> 19:32.730
I know what you're thinking.

19:33.110 --> 19:37.490
You're worried that if we destroy the antenna,

19:37.490 --> 19:39.400
we won't be able to go home, right?

19:39.400 --> 19:44.530
It isn't that I don't want to go home, 
but I wasn't really sure about it.

19:45.370 --> 19:49.750
If I can have time to think it over, 
that's just as good.

19:49.750 --> 19:53.630
It doesn't mean we'll never get home, does it?

19:53.630 --> 19:58.260
And we can't just leave the People of the Land.

20:00.050 --> 20:01.260
It didn't

20:02.430 --> 20:05.060
go well for us in Safil...

20:06.470 --> 20:08.810
Even if they thank us and say we saved them,

20:08.810 --> 20:10.690
some people will never make it home.

20:11.230 --> 20:14.230
I don't know if we'll be able to go home.

20:14.230 --> 20:17.530
But being able to go home makes you happy, right?

20:18.030 --> 20:20.070
So we need to make everyone happy!

20:20.990 --> 20:23.070
We can go home after we do that!

20:24.530 --> 20:27.580
You lack resolve, guild master.

20:27.870 --> 20:31.080
Just focus on what you can do!

20:31.080 --> 20:33.790
I don't know what I can do.

20:33.790 --> 20:36.420
But I won't let you bear the burden alone.

20:36.420 --> 20:37.670
We...

20:38.460 --> 20:40.590
I will bear it with you!

20:40.840 --> 20:41.930
So...

20:43.890 --> 20:45.100
You heard them.

20:45.430 --> 20:47.100
Shiroe...

20:47.100 --> 20:47.890
But...

20:48.640 --> 20:50.100
It's okay.

20:50.730 --> 20:53.560
You'll be fine, no matter what.

20:53.560 --> 20:55.110
Akatsuki...

20:58.820 --> 20:59.650
Yes?

20:59.650 --> 21:01.610
Hey, you're safe?

21:01.950 --> 21:04.030
We couldn't reach you with telepathy,

21:04.030 --> 21:06.030
so I got worried and came to lookâ€”

21:06.030 --> 21:06.870
Wait.

21:07.530 --> 21:09.370
Someone's in front of the antenna.

21:10.000 --> 21:12.370
I can't see his status from here.

21:12.830 --> 21:14.370
But most likely...

21:14.370 --> 21:15.830
Understood.

21:15.830 --> 21:19.380
Woodstock, you return to Akihabara 
and bolster the defenses.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.010
The raid boss.

21:21.300 --> 21:23.930
He wasn't there when we investigated, right?

21:23.930 --> 21:26.550
Maybe he spawns when the moon rises?

21:26.550 --> 21:27.930
Like the eternal moths?

21:27.930 --> 21:29.760
What a pain.

21:30.470 --> 21:32.810
Which means if we defeat him...

21:32.810 --> 21:35.100
The moths might all disappear, too!

21:35.350 --> 21:38.020
I don't know if he'll be that easy to handle...

21:38.020 --> 21:41.070
But the weird parts of this are still a game.

21:42.400 --> 21:44.740
Thank you, Henrietta.

21:44.740 --> 21:46.320
You're welcome.

21:47.450 --> 21:51.830
Antenna... MP... Raid boss, huh?

21:52.080 --> 21:53.200
Meow.

21:56.670 --> 21:59.210
There are thirty-four minutes until moonrise.

21:59.210 --> 22:00.340
There's no timeâ€”

22:00.340 --> 22:02.170
Thirty minutes is plenty.

22:03.090 --> 22:08.430
It was never possible to choose 
either the world or the antenna.

22:09.800 --> 22:13.180
Pick one? That's impossible.

22:14.230 --> 22:15.980
So we won't choose.

22:15.980 --> 22:18.980
We'll just tear apart this nonsense.

22:19.520 --> 22:21.860
Let's save them both.

22:21.860 --> 22:23.490
The world and the antenna.

22:27.410 --> 22:32.830
I'll show you what "two birds 
with one stone" really means.

24:05.670 --> 24:07.300
The counterattack begins.

24:07.300 --> 24:09.630
Shining glasses and sharpened minds.

24:09.630 --> 24:11.430
Friends you can believe in.

24:11.430 --> 24:13.430
They won't pick just one anymore.

24:13.430 --> 24:14.760
They'll protect everything.

24:14.760 --> 24:15.890
That is their answer.

24:15.890 --> 24:21.190
At the end of the battle, they reach a place 
where Shiroe takes on a new quest.

24:21.190 --> 24:23.690
For the two worlds he loves so much.

24:23.810 --> 24:30.030
<b>The Pioneers</b>

24:24.110 --> 24:26.150
Next time: The Pioneers.

24:26.150 --> 24:27.900
Cross over the horizon.
