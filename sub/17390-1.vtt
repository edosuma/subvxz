WEBVTT

00:03.422 --> 00:05.314
Okay munchkins, family meeting.

00:05.339 --> 00:06.791
Daddy and I have some exciting news.

00:06.816 --> 00:07.494
That's right.

00:07.519 --> 00:09.292
So, Katie, put your phone away. Emme,

00:09.317 --> 00:11.109
don't pick your nose. Teddy, buddy,

00:11.111 --> 00:12.544
stop touching yourself.

00:12.825 --> 00:13.578
I wasn't.

00:13.603 --> 00:14.886
You had both hands in your pants,

00:14.911 --> 00:17.412
moving around down there
like you're making origami.

00:18.989 --> 00:20.423
No hands in pants, all right?

00:20.425 --> 00:21.858
Let's make it a family motto.

00:22.575 --> 00:24.160
So, along with summer being over

00:24.162 --> 00:25.795
and school starting back up tomorrow,

00:25.797 --> 00:27.597
there's another change
happening in the family.

00:27.599 --> 00:30.233
I just got the official word and...

00:30.235 --> 00:31.868
I'm going back to work.

00:32.220 --> 00:33.183
Yay!

00:33.208 --> 00:35.215
- Yay!
- Yay!

00:35.240 --> 00:36.306
What's your job?

00:36.308 --> 00:37.507
It's the same job I had

00:37.509 --> 00:38.575
before you guys were born.

00:38.577 --> 00:39.676
I worked at a hospital,

00:39.678 --> 00:41.244
checking people's blood to find out

00:41.246 --> 00:42.545
what's making them sick.

00:42.547 --> 00:43.613
So you're a doctor?

00:43.615 --> 00:46.116
No.

00:46.118 --> 00:48.551
She's not a doctor.

00:48.553 --> 00:51.388
But it's very important work.

00:51.390 --> 00:53.809
Anyway, Daddy's gonna
be taking you to school,

00:53.834 --> 00:54.522
picking you up,

00:54.547 --> 00:56.169
watching you until I get
home, stuff like that.

00:56.194 --> 00:58.161
Yeah, since I'm a
contractor, I'm my own boss,

00:58.163 --> 01:00.697
so, I can work my
schedule around you guys.

01:00.699 --> 01:02.065
Look, all you guys need to know is,

01:02.067 --> 01:03.233
Daddy's in charge now.

01:03.235 --> 01:04.498
- That's right.
- Yeah!

01:04.524 --> 01:06.399
- Aw, bring it in.
- I love you, Daddy.

01:06.424 --> 01:08.191
Oh, you guys.

01:08.407 --> 01:10.040
We're gonna have so much fun.

01:10.042 --> 01:11.174
Can we get a puppy?

01:11.176 --> 01:12.375
- Sure.
- No!

01:12.377 --> 01:13.810
No...

01:13.812 --> 01:14.911
Well, which is it?

01:14.913 --> 01:17.213
Ask your mother. Not now.

01:17.215 --> 01:18.982
Do it later, when I'm not around.

01:20.419 --> 01:22.419
- Love you, Daddy.
- See?

01:22.421 --> 01:24.487
Katie thinks I'm doing great already.

01:24.489 --> 01:26.122
You can't trust a 13-year-old girl.

01:26.124 --> 01:28.091
She's all whacked out on hormones.

01:29.135 --> 01:30.093
Hormones?

01:30.095 --> 01:32.095
- Mm.
- My mom had those.

01:32.474 --> 01:33.468
She had to wear a patch

01:33.493 --> 01:35.993
just to keep from ripping our faces off.

01:36.970 --> 01:39.436
I can't believe I'm doing
this. I'm so excited.

01:40.006 --> 01:41.338
And guilty.

01:41.606 --> 01:43.273
And happy.

01:43.275 --> 01:44.974
And worried.

01:44.999 --> 01:46.450
You know, they make
a patch for that, too.

01:47.363 --> 01:48.302
Will you relax?

01:48.327 --> 01:49.662
Look, I got this.

01:49.664 --> 01:51.864
Me and the kids have a blast together.

01:51.866 --> 01:54.167
I'm Daddy fun times.

01:54.169 --> 01:55.457
Yeah, that's true.

01:55.482 --> 01:57.013
And I'll always be
home in time for dinner.

01:57.038 --> 01:58.338
- Yeah.
- I mean, it...

01:58.340 --> 02:00.173
it's not like I'm a doctor.

02:01.606 --> 02:02.842
Come on, honey,

02:02.844 --> 02:05.635
this was always the plan when
Emme started school full-time.

02:05.660 --> 02:06.612
Remember?

02:06.637 --> 02:08.705
Plus, we're gonna need the
extra money for college.

02:08.731 --> 02:10.389
Based on their ability
to flush a toilet,

02:10.414 --> 02:12.649
- I'm not seeing scholarships.
- You're right,

02:12.674 --> 02:15.121
it's fine because you are a great dad.

02:15.123 --> 02:16.422
- Oh...
- And it means so much to me,

02:16.447 --> 02:17.447
you stepping up like this.

02:17.472 --> 02:20.173
- Oh, well, I'm happy to do it.
- Mmm.

02:20.706 --> 02:22.405
And I'm not looking
for any kind of reward.

02:22.447 --> 02:23.396
Unless...

02:23.398 --> 02:25.036
you were thinking about
something, in which case,

02:25.061 --> 02:26.799
who am I to say no?

02:27.268 --> 02:28.935
Don't worry. You're
gonna get your reward.

02:29.663 --> 02:33.264
We're talking about
the same thing, right?

02:33.289 --> 02:35.156
You'll find out tonight.

02:37.541 --> 02:39.698
Okay, just one more picture.

02:39.723 --> 02:40.846
Oh, hey.

02:40.871 --> 02:44.350
Hold Emme in your arms sideways
like a big fish you just caught.

02:44.990 --> 02:46.519
Mom, we're not doing that.

02:46.750 --> 02:48.456
Okay, cut the cord and go to work.

02:48.481 --> 02:50.381
Yeah, I got to run.

02:50.688 --> 02:51.694
- Bye.
- I love you.

02:51.719 --> 02:53.052
- Love you, too.
- Love you.

02:53.077 --> 02:54.494
You, too.

02:55.112 --> 02:56.996
I am just so proud of you, sweet pea.

02:57.138 --> 02:59.705
You have a great first
day at school. Okay?

02:59.946 --> 03:01.244
Okay.

03:01.385 --> 03:02.584
Yeah...

03:06.162 --> 03:07.076
Daddy?

03:07.101 --> 03:08.107
Yeah, Butterbean?

03:08.109 --> 03:10.276
I'm worried about kindergarten.

03:10.481 --> 03:12.948
Aw, honey.

03:12.973 --> 03:14.906
You should be worried.

03:15.960 --> 03:18.451
Kids are mean.

03:18.453 --> 03:21.254
But just know if you
ever feel uncomfortable,

03:21.256 --> 03:22.522
you start swinging.

03:22.524 --> 03:23.723
Okay?

03:23.725 --> 03:24.620
A punch in the nose

03:24.645 --> 03:26.178
can be a real problem solver.

03:26.494 --> 03:28.828
Right? All right.

03:29.364 --> 03:30.732
Okay, bye, Daddy.

03:30.757 --> 03:32.390
Bye-bye, honey.

03:33.501 --> 03:35.368
Hello, kindergarten parents!

03:35.370 --> 03:38.383
I'm Mrs. Rodriguez, your
child's lead teacher.

03:38.408 --> 03:39.703
I'd like to welcome you all

03:39.728 --> 03:41.504
to the Kindergarten Parent Mingle.

03:41.971 --> 03:43.971
What?

03:43.996 --> 03:46.299
Now, has anyone seen Mrs. Burns?

03:46.301 --> 03:47.567
Is Mrs. Burns here?

03:47.569 --> 03:49.669
Uh, you must be talking about my wife.

03:49.671 --> 03:51.504
I'm Adam... uh, Mr. Burns.

03:51.506 --> 03:52.678
Oh, great.

03:52.703 --> 03:54.432
Mr. Burns, your wife
graciously volunteered

03:54.457 --> 03:56.522
to be our room parent, so
there's just a few things...

03:56.547 --> 03:57.243
Uh, listen,

03:57.245 --> 03:58.945
she's not gonna be able to do that.

03:58.947 --> 04:01.147
- See, she's decided to go back to work.
- Oh.

04:01.149 --> 04:02.710
Okay, so I'll just pencil you in.

04:02.735 --> 04:04.484
Whoa, hey, uh...

04:04.486 --> 04:05.635
I-I'd love to but, uh,

04:05.660 --> 04:06.998
I have a job, too, see,

04:07.023 --> 04:09.355
so please stop writing my name down.

04:09.357 --> 04:10.689
What a wonderful group,

04:10.714 --> 04:12.843
I can't wait to meet
each and every one of you!

04:12.868 --> 04:15.165
Mr. Burns, I'd like to
see you after the mingle.

04:18.064 --> 04:20.789
Hey, looks like you got
stuck in here too, huh?

04:20.791 --> 04:21.957
I'm Adam.

04:21.959 --> 04:22.809
Lowell.

04:22.834 --> 04:24.176
- I'm a stay-at-home dad.
- Oh.

04:24.201 --> 04:25.961
Four years now, it
hasn't changed me at all.

04:25.963 --> 04:27.162
Oh, you got a little something...

04:27.164 --> 04:28.931
Hey!

04:28.933 --> 04:30.766
I'm gonna say it has changed you.

04:31.192 --> 04:33.001
Sorry, I'm a little revved up.

04:33.003 --> 04:34.503
I just can't believe
they're not introducing

04:34.505 --> 04:36.271
any foreign language in kindergarten.

04:36.273 --> 04:37.706
How can our children compete

04:37.708 --> 04:40.809
in a global economy without
fluency in a second language?

04:43.948 --> 04:45.914
You know this school is free, right?

04:47.240 --> 04:49.184
Free stuff is not that great.

04:49.186 --> 04:50.686
Water is free,

04:50.688 --> 04:53.322
but beer you got to pay for. Hm?

04:53.833 --> 04:55.124
Beer.

04:55.531 --> 04:59.065
It's so great to connect
on a masculine level again.

05:04.969 --> 05:07.336
Where are the regular moms?

05:08.561 --> 05:09.507
Hey,

05:09.631 --> 05:10.832
I-I think I know you, right?

05:10.834 --> 05:13.476
Didn't you sneak a flask
into the school play?

05:13.501 --> 05:14.676
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

05:14.678 --> 05:15.744
Marie Faldanado.

05:15.746 --> 05:17.546
- Ah.
- My kid's in Teddy's class.

05:17.548 --> 05:19.119
Hey, uh, did Teddy get invited

05:19.144 --> 05:20.576
to Brady's birthday party?

05:20.601 --> 05:22.735
Because my Victor didn't
and it's happened before.

05:23.245 --> 05:24.891
Yeah, we had Victor
over last year, he's a...

05:24.916 --> 05:26.655
Oh, yeah, Victor.

05:26.657 --> 05:27.720
What?

05:27.745 --> 05:28.811
Well, he flushed a couple of

05:28.893 --> 05:30.460
Teddy's Hot Wheels down the toilet,

05:30.485 --> 05:31.415
he called my wife a hottie.

05:31.440 --> 05:33.295
He was kind of a jackass.

05:33.648 --> 05:37.383
I can't believe you'd
call my child that word!

05:38.710 --> 05:41.478
Hey-hey, isn't it two words?

05:44.287 --> 05:45.920
It's two words, right?

05:47.282 --> 05:50.556
And to make up for a
lack of funding, we depend

05:50.581 --> 05:51.972
on parent volunteers.

05:51.997 --> 05:53.148
I just think of the children.

05:53.150 --> 05:54.850
There's not a thing
I wouldn't do for them

05:54.852 --> 05:56.752
and I know you feel the same way.

05:57.310 --> 05:59.121
No.

05:59.508 --> 06:01.924
But everyone else has
refused to be room parent.

06:01.926 --> 06:04.526
Great, put me on that list.

06:05.295 --> 06:06.695
That's a shame.

06:07.343 --> 06:08.248
It would also be a shame if

06:08.273 --> 06:10.373
I don't teach your daughter to read.

06:12.203 --> 06:13.202
What are you saying?

06:13.204 --> 06:14.469
I said that's a shame.

06:14.471 --> 06:15.871
No, you said something after that.

06:15.873 --> 06:16.872
I don't think so.

06:16.874 --> 06:18.140
- Yes, you did...
- No, I didn't.

06:18.142 --> 06:19.074
- Yes, you did.
- No, I didn't.

06:19.076 --> 06:20.509
- Yes, you did...
- No, I didn't.

06:23.347 --> 06:24.680
- Yes, you did.
- Nope.

06:29.021 --> 06:30.285
Okay, I'll do it.

06:30.287 --> 06:31.653
Wonderful!

06:31.655 --> 06:33.121
Your first event is tomorrow's

06:33.123 --> 06:35.757
Ice Cream Sundae Fun
Day party at 11:00 a.m.

06:35.759 --> 06:36.873
Okay, but I mean,

06:36.898 --> 06:38.989
you're gonna teach Emme to read, right?

06:39.014 --> 06:41.181
We'll see how the party goes.

06:53.107 --> 06:54.248
Adam, what's up?

06:54.250 --> 06:55.346
Are the kids okay?

06:55.371 --> 06:56.817
Yeah, the kids are fine.

06:56.819 --> 06:58.886
How come you didn't tell
me you were room mom?

06:58.888 --> 07:01.243
Oh, honey, I forgot.

07:01.268 --> 07:02.367
You forgot?

07:02.392 --> 07:04.487
Well guess who's room mom now? Me!

07:06.523 --> 07:07.694
Are you laughing at me?

07:07.696 --> 07:09.029
So hard.

07:09.031 --> 07:10.898
All right, I'm done talking to you.

07:11.559 --> 07:13.300
I understand. I love you.

07:13.302 --> 07:14.168
I love you, too.

07:15.409 --> 07:16.937
Oh, poor bastard.

07:18.340 --> 07:20.741
You didn't hang up,
I can still hear you.

07:26.862 --> 07:28.817
So guys, how was school today?

07:28.841 --> 07:29.579
I'm hungry.

07:29.580 --> 07:31.186
- And thirsty.
- Me, too.

07:31.188 --> 07:34.323
Uh, I didn't... I don't have anything.

07:34.325 --> 07:36.992
- What?
- I've literally never been thirstier.

07:36.994 --> 07:40.038
Mommy had snacks and ice
cold waters every day.

07:40.063 --> 07:43.398
Hey, easy, it's me, Daddy fun times.

07:43.400 --> 07:44.160
Huh?

07:44.185 --> 07:45.606
Uh, here...

07:45.853 --> 07:48.220
have a Listerine Strip.

07:54.211 --> 07:55.911
What the...

08:03.709 --> 08:04.774
Headphones off.

08:04.776 --> 08:05.842
Everybody line up.

08:05.844 --> 08:06.843
What?

08:06.845 --> 08:08.445
Line up: one, two, three.

08:08.447 --> 08:11.147
I can't believe I have
to explain a line to you.

08:11.932 --> 08:14.517
Why did you just dump
all your stuff everywhere?

08:14.519 --> 08:15.307
We always do.

08:15.332 --> 08:16.386
Well, who cleans it up?

08:16.388 --> 08:17.299
Mommy.

08:17.324 --> 08:18.788
And she's not upset about that?

08:18.790 --> 08:20.557
I don't know.

08:20.559 --> 08:21.925
Okay, well, from now on,

08:21.927 --> 08:23.493
you're gonna hang your backpacks up,

08:23.495 --> 08:24.694
and you're gonna clean up the truck

08:24.696 --> 08:25.695
before you get out,

08:25.697 --> 08:27.964
and close the door!

08:27.966 --> 08:29.733
That's right.

08:33.972 --> 08:35.205
Any questions?

08:37.909 --> 08:39.943
Well, I got one.

08:39.945 --> 08:42.044
What the hell happened to my life?

08:42.047 --> 08:43.645
Ooh, Daddy said a bad word.

08:43.648 --> 08:45.715
Oh sure, that you heard.

08:52.624 --> 08:56.893
What kind of animal puts gum
on a chair and just leaves it?

09:05.680 --> 09:06.536
Hey.

09:06.538 --> 09:07.837
Hey...

09:07.839 --> 09:08.774
Where are the kids?

09:08.799 --> 09:10.173
Upstairs, washing up for dinner.

09:10.175 --> 09:11.274
How was your day?

09:11.276 --> 09:12.842
It was incredible.

09:12.844 --> 09:14.477
All right, I mean,
first I was freaking out

09:14.479 --> 09:16.312
because I'd been home
with the kids for so long,

09:16.314 --> 09:18.681
- you know, but I fit right in.
- Good.

09:18.683 --> 09:20.683
I mean, I did try to cut the
crust off somebody's sandwich

09:20.685 --> 09:21.718
at lunch, but other than that,

09:21.720 --> 09:23.759
it was amazing

09:23.784 --> 09:25.216
and it wouldn't have been possible

09:25.241 --> 09:26.389
- if it weren't for you.
- Oh.

09:26.391 --> 09:27.672
Thank you.

09:28.340 --> 09:29.726
Oh, that's great.

09:29.728 --> 09:31.461
You're welcome.

09:31.463 --> 09:32.595
I want out.

09:32.597 --> 09:34.589
What? What happened?

09:34.614 --> 09:37.000
It was awful. Those
are not the same kids

09:37.002 --> 09:38.902
I used to see when I came home at night.

09:38.904 --> 09:41.072
Those kids smelled good
and were delightful.

09:41.097 --> 09:41.674
Well yeah,

09:41.699 --> 09:43.506
it took me all day to get 'em that way.

09:43.508 --> 09:45.112
You were just getting the greatest hits.

09:45.137 --> 09:46.876
Yeah. Now it's the deep cuts.

09:46.878 --> 09:50.296
The... the drum solos, the
bass player sings a song.

09:50.321 --> 09:52.299
They didn't even clean
up after themselves.

09:52.324 --> 09:55.392
It's like living with
three tiny truckers.

09:55.987 --> 09:57.187
Look, honey,

09:57.189 --> 09:58.688
I understand you had a tough day,

09:58.690 --> 09:59.856
I do. I do.

09:59.858 --> 10:02.625
But the thing you need to remember is:

10:02.760 --> 10:04.026
you already got your reward,

10:04.051 --> 10:06.085
so, no takey-backsies.

10:07.332 --> 10:10.400
I'm just not all-the-time guy, okay?

10:10.402 --> 10:12.268
I'm Daddy fun times!

10:12.558 --> 10:14.804
I'm... I'm like Johnny Cash.

10:14.806 --> 10:15.522
Okay?

10:15.547 --> 10:17.574
I fly in, I play the prison,

10:17.576 --> 10:18.808
everybody loves me,

10:18.810 --> 10:19.943
and then I'm out of there.

10:19.945 --> 10:21.411
I don't want to be the warden.

10:21.413 --> 10:23.246
Well, I don't want to
be the warden, either.

10:23.248 --> 10:24.919
I mean, it's not like
I'm so great at it.

10:24.944 --> 10:26.716
No kidding. Teddy?

10:26.718 --> 10:29.619
He has his hands in
his pants all the time.

10:30.422 --> 10:33.556
He opens doors with his shoulders.

10:33.935 --> 10:35.225
Well, I think we're better off

10:35.227 --> 10:37.427
with him not touching doorknobs.

10:37.429 --> 10:38.628
Yeah, look, all I know is

10:38.630 --> 10:41.698
I gave you three perfect babies.

10:41.700 --> 10:43.233
And as far as I can tell,

10:43.235 --> 10:45.268
you ruined 'em.

10:45.270 --> 10:47.103
Whoa there, Johnny Cash,

10:47.105 --> 10:49.368
I think you mean we ruined 'em.

10:49.393 --> 10:51.341
Uh-uh, no, no, no, for 13 years,

10:51.343 --> 10:53.376
you have been in the driver's seat.

10:53.378 --> 10:55.071
I was just riding shotgun.

10:55.096 --> 10:57.380
Well, it doesn't matter
who was driving before,

10:57.382 --> 10:59.282
because you're behind the wheel now.

10:59.284 --> 11:00.383
- Oh, really?
- Mm-hmm.

11:00.385 --> 11:01.440
Well, then, guess what,

11:01.465 --> 11:03.152
I'm taking my hands off the wheel,

11:03.154 --> 11:04.721
I'm opening the car door,

11:04.723 --> 11:06.266
and I'm rolling out.

11:06.291 --> 11:09.260
Oh, yeah? Well, I'm
rolling out the other side.

11:09.285 --> 11:10.745
Then I'll see you in the gutter.

11:10.770 --> 11:13.203
It's where I found you.

11:13.673 --> 11:16.933
- Hey, Mom.
- Hi, cuties. How was your day?

11:17.712 --> 11:19.202
We don't want Daddy to
stay at home anymore.

11:19.204 --> 11:20.068
Oh...

11:20.093 --> 11:21.771
We had to line up,

11:21.773 --> 11:23.940
in a line.

11:24.714 --> 11:27.382
So we were wondering if you could...

11:27.479 --> 11:30.280
you know, stop going to your job.

11:31.495 --> 11:35.351
Sometimes the wisest
words come from children.

11:35.865 --> 11:38.554
Well, you guys were
okay with it yesterday.

11:38.556 --> 11:40.590
Our snack was Listerine strips.

11:43.873 --> 11:45.795
Okay, just let me talk to Daddy.

11:45.797 --> 11:47.939
- That means yes!
- Oh, really? Yes!

11:47.964 --> 11:49.897
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

11:51.613 --> 11:53.096
How's this supposed to work?

11:53.121 --> 11:54.461
I mean, I'm not quitting my job.

11:54.486 --> 11:56.583
So what, I'm just supposed
to do everything myself?

11:56.608 --> 12:00.109
Well, sounds like a plan
that makes everybody happy.

12:00.384 --> 12:03.152
You know what? You
can be a real jackass.

12:04.616 --> 12:06.916
Maybe it is one word.

12:13.232 --> 12:14.829
- Morning, everyone.
- Good morning, Mom.

12:14.854 --> 12:15.987
- Morning, Mom.
- Morning, Mom.

12:16.431 --> 12:17.433
You okay?

12:17.465 --> 12:19.331
Yeah, yeah, I'm great.

12:19.333 --> 12:21.233
I, uh, got up at 5:00 this morning,

12:21.235 --> 12:23.537
and I-I figured out an
after-school schedule,

12:23.562 --> 12:26.171
a couple carpools, couple play dates.

12:26.173 --> 12:28.907
Now I just have to do morning
drop-off a little early

12:28.909 --> 12:30.476
so I can get to work on time.

12:30.478 --> 12:32.311
I got this.

12:32.313 --> 12:34.913
Are you coming to Ice
Cream Sundae Fun Day?

12:34.915 --> 12:36.949
That's today?

12:37.872 --> 12:39.685
Um... yeah, you know,

12:39.687 --> 12:41.958
I-I-could just... I can ask my boss

12:41.983 --> 12:46.308
if-if-if-if I can miss,
uh, my second day, uh...

12:47.952 --> 12:49.267
Oh, jeez.

12:49.292 --> 12:52.064
Mommy's having a little
trouble breathing.

12:52.066 --> 12:53.932
Okay, kids, your mom and
I need to have a talk,

12:53.934 --> 12:56.301
so, uh...

12:56.724 --> 12:58.871
get in the pantry.

12:58.873 --> 13:00.739
Come on, take your cereal with you.

13:00.741 --> 13:02.775
This is why these
open-floor plans don't work.

13:02.777 --> 13:05.277
There's no place to have
a private conversation.

13:05.279 --> 13:08.180
Teddy, one hand on the
bowl, one hand on the spoon.

13:11.185 --> 13:12.634
Okay, I don't think this is working.

13:12.659 --> 13:13.845
I don't want to quit my job.

13:13.870 --> 13:15.290
Yeah, well, you shouldn't have to, okay?

13:15.448 --> 13:17.089
This is important to you,

13:17.091 --> 13:18.357
and I am not gonna stand by

13:18.359 --> 13:19.758
and let you be treated like this.

13:19.760 --> 13:21.359
Why are you yelling
my side of the fight?

13:21.384 --> 13:23.718
I don't know. I feel bad.

13:23.831 --> 13:25.230
I don't like it. It
makes me want to yell.

13:25.232 --> 13:27.266
Well, I feel bad, too. I mean,

13:27.268 --> 13:29.508
I don't want to turn
everything upside-down.

13:29.578 --> 13:30.636
All right, look, we don't have time

13:30.638 --> 13:33.605
to figure this whole
thing out now, okay?

13:33.607 --> 13:36.542
I'll take the kids to school,
I'll do Sunday Dumb Day,

13:36.544 --> 13:38.634
but just for today. Okay?

13:38.659 --> 13:40.712
We need to find a solution
that makes you happy,

13:40.714 --> 13:44.005
and me happy, and the
kids happy, and me happy.

13:44.396 --> 13:45.917
Okay, I get it. You want out.

13:45.919 --> 13:47.563
But look, the most important thing

13:47.588 --> 13:48.705
is that the kids are taken care of.

13:48.730 --> 13:50.096
That's right, we're all about the kids.

13:50.578 --> 13:53.158
All right, I gotta go. Bye.

13:53.160 --> 13:55.527
You left something.

13:59.867 --> 14:01.266
Forgot my phone.

14:04.114 --> 14:05.317
Adam!

14:07.276 --> 14:09.543
I know, I know.

14:09.780 --> 14:12.514
Can't go anywhere without these.

14:18.324 --> 14:19.284
Hey.

14:19.286 --> 14:20.526
Hey.

14:20.551 --> 14:23.018
I volunteered to be
your assistant today.

14:23.043 --> 14:24.462
I'm finding myself very drawn

14:24.487 --> 14:27.155
to your alpha-male energy.

14:27.578 --> 14:29.495
Don't say stuff like that, Lowell.

14:29.497 --> 14:31.196
It's weird.

14:31.533 --> 14:33.867
Such an alpha.

14:35.736 --> 14:38.470
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, Marie.

14:38.472 --> 14:40.331
Look, I'm sorry for
what I said yesterday

14:40.356 --> 14:41.176
about Victor. I...

14:41.201 --> 14:42.541
Actually, it made me think.

14:42.543 --> 14:44.599
He has hit a rough patch.

14:44.624 --> 14:45.777
I'm a single mom.

14:45.802 --> 14:46.350
Maybe...

14:46.375 --> 14:48.709
- Victor could use a male role model.
- Oh.

14:48.734 --> 14:50.634
Maybe next weekend you
could take him camping?

14:51.475 --> 14:53.752
Oh, uh, I...

14:53.754 --> 14:56.421
Gotcha. You were sweating.

14:56.423 --> 14:57.489
Oh...

14:57.491 --> 14:58.757
He was sweating? I was sweating

14:58.759 --> 15:00.492
because he's my role model.

15:03.063 --> 15:04.730
- Andi.
- Hey, guys.

15:04.732 --> 15:06.212
- Hey.
- Hey.

15:06.237 --> 15:08.734
- What are you doing here?
- Oh, uh, took an early lunch.

15:08.736 --> 15:10.035
I thought you might need some help.

15:10.692 --> 15:12.204
What, are you checking up on me?

15:12.206 --> 15:14.473
Well, you did leave
the kids in the pantry.

15:14.475 --> 15:16.479
You put your children in the pantry?

15:16.504 --> 15:18.277
You know, Victor could
use a little pantry time.

15:18.279 --> 15:20.646
Go scoop something.

15:21.201 --> 15:22.488
What's going on?

15:22.513 --> 15:24.716
I was just thinking about
what you're going through,

15:24.718 --> 15:26.051
and, you know, maybe you're right.

15:26.053 --> 15:27.786
Maybe you're just not cut out for this.

15:27.788 --> 15:29.388
Not cut out for this?

15:29.390 --> 15:30.856
That's what I say when I fire people

15:30.858 --> 15:33.385
Are y... are you trying to fire me?

15:33.799 --> 15:35.827
Well, let me tell you
something, love of my life.

15:35.829 --> 15:37.196
I don't get fired, okay?

15:37.198 --> 15:40.032
I have a 99% customer satisfaction rate.

15:40.034 --> 15:41.600
I have a plaque from the county,

15:41.602 --> 15:43.735
which I said we should hang in the den,

15:43.737 --> 15:46.672
and you never did, and
now nobody can find it.

15:46.697 --> 15:48.321
Okay, well, there's a big difference

15:48.346 --> 15:50.409
between building
houses and raising kids.

15:50.411 --> 15:51.944
Not true. Not true at all.

15:51.946 --> 15:53.946
They both need a solid foundation.

15:53.948 --> 15:56.748
That's right, didn't see
that coming, did you, huh?

15:56.750 --> 15:59.918
Look, all I know is I
can take care of our kids.

15:59.920 --> 16:01.770
Didn't see that coming either, did you?

16:02.090 --> 16:03.589
Well, great.

16:03.591 --> 16:05.726
Do you have a plan to
get the kids in line?

16:05.751 --> 16:07.784
Yes, I do.

16:10.454 --> 16:12.547
But it's a secret.

16:12.572 --> 16:14.633
- So...
- Great.

16:14.635 --> 16:16.568
Can't wait to see it.

16:17.162 --> 16:19.081
- Good luck.
- Good luck?

16:19.106 --> 16:21.173
That's the other thing
I say when I fire people.

16:21.818 --> 16:23.075
Good luck!

16:23.077 --> 16:25.844
I don't need luck. I need help.

16:27.525 --> 16:29.218
I can't believe I'm about to say this,

16:29.243 --> 16:32.082
but, Lowell, what do
you think I should do?

16:32.107 --> 16:34.052
Well, I managed to get my girls addicted

16:34.054 --> 16:37.055
to lottery scratchers,
and I simply withhold them

16:37.057 --> 16:39.024
when they don't do what I say.

16:44.111 --> 16:45.664
Well, first of all, good luck

16:45.666 --> 16:48.734
with your future exotic dancers.

16:48.736 --> 16:51.069
Plus, I don't have time to get
my kids addicted to something,

16:51.071 --> 16:53.686
and then take it away,
I need a solution now.

16:53.711 --> 16:55.507
Oh, my God.

16:55.509 --> 16:57.309
My iPad is at one percent. What do I do?

16:57.311 --> 17:00.212
- Kill your apps.
- Dad, give me your phone.

17:00.214 --> 17:01.768
I just need a little something
to get me to the house.

17:01.793 --> 17:06.962
Relax. It's like you guys
are addict... ed to those.

17:09.857 --> 17:12.790
My little junkies.

17:20.373 --> 17:23.773
And... panic.

17:25.593 --> 17:26.705
We can't get online!

17:26.708 --> 17:28.507
Nothing works. W-what's happening?

17:28.509 --> 17:30.509
Is it the Wi-Fi? Is the Wi-Fi out?

17:30.893 --> 17:32.945
No, it's not out.

17:32.947 --> 17:36.315
I just installed a
rolling Wi-Fi password.

17:36.617 --> 17:39.285
Every day, the password will change.

17:39.287 --> 17:43.199
And until your chores get
done, you won't get your fix...

17:43.478 --> 17:45.440
the new password.

17:45.465 --> 17:47.386
So pick your clothes up off the floor,

17:47.411 --> 17:50.293
put your backpacks where they belong,

17:50.318 --> 17:53.599
and keep your hands out of your pants!

17:53.601 --> 17:55.534
Oh, my God, you've gone crazy!

17:55.536 --> 17:56.969
At least ease us in.

17:56.971 --> 17:58.967
Maybe today is just explaining it,

17:58.992 --> 18:00.640
and then tomorrow...

18:00.642 --> 18:02.341
I know you're mad at
me, but you know what?

18:02.343 --> 18:04.746
That's okay. Because
I'm not your friend.

18:05.249 --> 18:06.648
I'm your father.

18:07.097 --> 18:08.948
I'm the warden.

18:08.973 --> 18:12.107
And it's my job to rehabilitate you.

18:12.147 --> 18:15.448
Now, my chores are done,
so I have the password.

18:15.990 --> 18:19.692
If you'll excuse me...
I have candy to crush.

18:26.741 --> 18:28.367
- Hey.
- Hi, honey.

18:28.369 --> 18:30.303
Wow, it's so clean.

18:30.305 --> 18:31.637
And quiet.

18:32.451 --> 18:34.907
Did you put the kids
in the pantry again?

18:35.840 --> 18:39.779
No. It's clean and quiet
because... Daddy won.

18:40.031 --> 18:42.464
That's right. And I didn't yell at them.

18:42.489 --> 18:46.024
I outwitted 'em. Like the Roadrunner.

18:47.476 --> 18:48.921
Ooh...

18:48.923 --> 18:50.423
Oh...

18:51.464 --> 18:53.259
Thank you.

18:53.370 --> 18:55.804
Look...

18:56.173 --> 18:58.931
I love you, and I
want to do this for you

18:58.933 --> 19:00.433
because you deserve it.

19:00.435 --> 19:02.501
And now, I know I can.

19:02.503 --> 19:04.904
So don't worry about the kids.

19:04.906 --> 19:06.449
I got it.

19:07.002 --> 19:08.917
Wow.

19:08.942 --> 19:10.670
I think this might
be the most attractive

19:10.695 --> 19:12.361
you have ever been.

19:13.009 --> 19:14.350
I agree.

19:16.543 --> 19:19.160
So I guess me coming
to school was worth it.

19:20.043 --> 19:21.949
- What?
- What?

19:33.835 --> 19:36.102
Wait a minute.

19:41.441 --> 19:44.844
So you came down to the school...

19:44.846 --> 19:47.613
and you said all that stuff...

19:48.130 --> 19:50.163
so that I would...

19:50.807 --> 19:52.540
to get me to...

19:55.561 --> 19:56.989
No. I had it and I lost it.

19:57.718 --> 19:59.425
It's too complicated.

19:59.427 --> 20:01.127
Eh, drink your beer, Roadrunner.

20:01.129 --> 20:02.728
Yeah.

20:07.694 --> 20:09.827
- Hey, Mom.
- Hey, guys.

20:10.448 --> 20:12.163
- Uh, Dad?
- Yeah?

20:13.558 --> 20:15.500
We just wanted to say we were sorry.

20:16.190 --> 20:17.795
We were super inconsiderate.

20:17.820 --> 20:18.769
And spoiled.

20:18.794 --> 20:21.595
You're then best Daddy in the world.

20:26.075 --> 20:28.873
Aw, I love you guys. Bring it in.

20:28.898 --> 20:31.675
Come on.

20:31.828 --> 20:32.827
Mm.

20:33.487 --> 20:35.947
Daddy, can we have a puppy?

20:36.182 --> 20:39.392
Oh, sweetheart, you know we can't.

20:39.417 --> 20:42.329
Well, maybe we should
think about a puppy.

20:42.354 --> 20:44.565
- Really. Mom?
- Mom, are you serious?

20:48.578 --> 20:50.360
What happened here?

20:50.362 --> 20:52.763
Everybody loves Johnny Cash.
