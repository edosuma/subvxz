WEBVTT

00:01.600 --> 00:02.500
- Previously on
"Emerald City"...

00:04.540 --> 00:05.640
- My father was the only one
to see me as I truly am.

00:05.670 --> 00:06.700
- I do see you.

00:06.740 --> 00:08.440
- The crest is King Pastoria's,

00:08.480 --> 00:09.880
handed down to his daughter
at birth.

00:09.910 --> 00:10.870
The Princess...

00:10.910 --> 00:12.310
Ozma.

00:12.350 --> 00:13.490
- The Witch of the East
is dead.

00:13.510 --> 00:15.680
- A witch's spells are her own.

00:15.720 --> 00:18.320
Normally, East would have
had an apprentice,

00:18.350 --> 00:20.480
but you put an end
to all that, didn't you?

00:24.260 --> 00:25.900
- Forgive me.

00:28.400 --> 00:30.440
- The Mother Witch lives

00:30.460 --> 00:32.560
and is breeding witches
for Glinda.

00:32.600 --> 00:34.500
- Roan.

00:34.540 --> 00:36.240
- Lucas?

00:36.270 --> 00:37.400
- That's not my name.

00:37.440 --> 00:39.510
I return to our fight
against The Wizard.

00:39.540 --> 00:41.700
I seek leniency for Dorothy,

00:41.740 --> 00:43.910
who spared my life at Nimbo.

00:43.940 --> 00:45.670
Even if she was sent
by The Wizard to kill you.

00:45.710 --> 00:47.240
- I will return

00:47.280 --> 00:48.940
with all the soldiers of Ev,

00:48.980 --> 00:52.720
and we will turn your
Emerald City red with blood.

00:52.750 --> 00:54.550
Make these guns.

00:54.590 --> 00:55.930
We take them to war.

00:55.960 --> 00:57.430
A war on magic!

01:04.670 --> 01:07.610
- I should be
coming with you.

01:07.640 --> 01:10.480
- Who will look after
Emerald City?

01:10.500 --> 01:12.940
No one better
than you.

01:12.970 --> 01:14.640
- But if you are to meet
the witches in battle,

01:14.680 --> 01:15.680
then I should be there.

01:15.710 --> 01:18.450
- There will be no battle.

01:18.480 --> 01:21.550
After retrieving
the weapons from Ev,

01:21.580 --> 01:24.250
we'll march north to Glinda
and bury her

01:24.290 --> 01:26.630
and her pathetic witchlings.

01:26.650 --> 01:28.780
Then we'll host
a celebration

01:28.820 --> 01:32.460
to quell any doubts that science
triumphs over magic.

01:49.380 --> 01:51.350
- You've been
keeping secrets.

01:51.380 --> 01:53.350
- I've been keeping
a dagger.

01:53.380 --> 01:55.280
For protection.

01:55.320 --> 01:58.360
- This belongs to
the Princess Ozma.

01:58.390 --> 01:59.790
Heir to the throne
of Emerald City.

01:59.820 --> 02:01.780
Her father, King Pastoria,

02:01.820 --> 02:04.450
gave this to her
on her nameday.

02:04.490 --> 02:07.020
- I don't know what
any of that means.

02:07.060 --> 02:09.630
- It's sacred.

02:09.660 --> 02:12.700
As sacred
as Ozma was, herself.

02:15.070 --> 02:16.710
- Is she dead?

02:18.570 --> 02:20.540
- When The Wizard defeated
The Beast Forever,

02:20.570 --> 02:25.510
he consolidated his power by
slaughtering the King and Queen.

02:26.510 --> 02:29.710
And the Princess.

02:29.750 --> 02:32.520
- What's that
got to do with me?

02:34.820 --> 02:37.850
- If, by some miracle,
she survived...

02:40.730 --> 02:43.340
She'd be exactly your age.

02:43.360 --> 02:44.630
- I'm not a princess.

02:44.670 --> 02:45.670
- You don't know
what you are.

02:45.700 --> 02:47.570
- I'm a boy.

02:47.600 --> 02:49.370
- You were turned
into a boy.

02:49.400 --> 02:51.570
Why else but to hide you?
To protect you.

02:51.610 --> 02:53.780
- Everyone keeps telling me
who and what I am.

02:53.810 --> 02:56.380
When do I get to decide?

02:56.410 --> 03:00.340
- You are the only child of
Samuel and Katherine Pastoria.

03:00.380 --> 03:03.380
Your parents loved you and kept
you safe till the day they died.

03:03.420 --> 03:05.860
Or you're an orphan,
with no past and no future

03:05.890 --> 03:08.090
who was hidden
for no reason.

03:08.120 --> 03:11.050
You want to decide?

03:11.090 --> 03:13.320
Then decide.

03:16.500 --> 03:18.540
Who are you?

03:28.710 --> 03:32.920
- What kind of a name
is Ozma?

03:32.950 --> 03:37.390
- It means "Leader of Oz."

03:37.420 --> 03:39.430
- Me?

03:39.450 --> 03:42.920
- We were born
for greater things, you and I.

03:42.960 --> 03:44.930
We were born to fly.

04:04.550 --> 04:06.520
- There's no way out.

04:06.550 --> 04:10.590
I've been looking
for months.

04:10.620 --> 04:11.920
- How often do they
check on you?

04:11.950 --> 04:14.580
Twice a day.

04:14.620 --> 04:16.420
- So they can get in here?

04:16.459 --> 04:17.600
- Yeah.

04:17.630 --> 04:20.500
Sometimes there,
sometimes here.

04:20.529 --> 04:23.670
Sometimes this wall.

04:23.700 --> 04:26.610
They have magic.

04:29.670 --> 04:32.770
I'm conspicuously mortal.

04:32.810 --> 04:34.980
- How far along are you?

04:35.010 --> 04:37.750
- Far.

04:37.780 --> 04:40.650
- And your crime?

04:40.680 --> 04:42.950
- Falling in love.

04:42.980 --> 04:46.950
I broke my oath of celibacy
to the High Council.

04:46.990 --> 04:48.530
I hid it long enough
that now

04:48.560 --> 04:51.630
she doesn't know
what to do with me.

04:51.660 --> 04:53.600
Others weren't as lucky.

04:53.630 --> 04:55.800
- Glinda spared you
because of your child.

04:55.830 --> 04:59.710
- Glinda only cares
about her own.

04:59.730 --> 05:01.900
Like the child
you brought with you.

05:01.940 --> 05:03.810
She's a witch.
- Yes.

05:03.840 --> 05:06.680
And she's not staying either.

05:06.710 --> 05:09.650
- Given your crime,
I doubt she'll get a vote.

05:09.680 --> 05:11.980
- What crime is that?

05:12.010 --> 05:13.980
- Kidnapping Glinda's husband.

05:18.550 --> 05:22.490
- I searched everywhere
for you, Roan.

05:27.560 --> 05:30.190
I thought I'd lost you
forever.

05:30.230 --> 05:32.190
- Well, had I known...

05:32.230 --> 05:34.530
- You couldn't have.

05:34.570 --> 05:37.880
The spell was designed
to protect you.

05:39.270 --> 05:40.970
If ever you're exposed,

05:41.010 --> 05:44.050
you'd have no memory of me.

05:46.080 --> 05:50.820
But perhaps
the magic worked too well.

05:50.850 --> 05:53.020
- I'm here, aren't I?

05:56.790 --> 06:00.820
- How long have you been
traveling with this assassin?

06:00.860 --> 06:03.590
- Dorothy's not an assassin.

06:03.630 --> 06:06.600
- The Wizard sent her
to kill me.

06:08.700 --> 06:12.500
- She saved my life,
Glinda.

06:12.540 --> 06:15.840
- And what did you do
for her?

06:19.610 --> 06:23.580
- The same,
when necessary.

06:23.620 --> 06:27.260
- And when necessity
played no part?

06:32.890 --> 06:34.290
- Glinda...

06:38.330 --> 06:42.770
I can't be responsible for
my actions if I was not myself.

06:48.810 --> 06:52.790
- Then don't come back
until you are.

07:09.700 --> 07:12.740
- Where is
your baby's father?

07:14.900 --> 07:17.930
- Murdered by The Wizard.

07:17.970 --> 07:20.940
- The Wizard?

07:20.970 --> 07:22.740
Why?

07:22.780 --> 07:26.550
- As I betrayed Glinda,
he betrayed The Wizard.

07:27.980 --> 07:30.780
People fear monsters.

07:30.820 --> 07:34.060
Attacks from the sea or sky.

07:34.090 --> 07:36.860
But what they should really fear

07:36.890 --> 07:39.860
is The Wizard of Oz.

07:39.890 --> 07:42.930
He's the true
Beast Forever.

07:47.370 --> 07:50.080
- Lucas.

07:50.100 --> 07:52.670
- No, don't call me that.

07:58.410 --> 08:00.640
- What should I call you?

08:03.680 --> 08:06.350
- My name is Roan.

08:06.390 --> 08:09.800
- Who's married.

08:09.820 --> 08:10.920
Do you have children?

08:10.960 --> 08:12.800
- No.

08:12.830 --> 08:14.700
- Do you love her?
- Stop.

08:15.900 --> 08:17.100
- No matter
what I call you,

08:17.130 --> 08:18.990
you're still the same man.

08:19.030 --> 08:21.000
- How can I be?

08:25.810 --> 08:29.650
You have to convince Glinda
that you mean her no harm.

08:29.680 --> 08:31.750
- That would be a lie.
- Then I can't help you.

08:31.780 --> 08:34.690
- That woman needs help.

08:34.720 --> 08:37.919
Look, I know
you're confused.

08:37.950 --> 08:41.679
I've been confused, too,
ever since I came to Oz.

08:42.990 --> 08:45.850
But then I found you.
- Oh, Dorothy.

08:45.890 --> 08:48.690
- We found each other.
- Yes.

08:48.730 --> 08:50.140
- Then do something.

08:50.160 --> 08:52.830
- I can't.

08:52.870 --> 08:55.010
- Don't you remember anything
that happened between us?

08:55.040 --> 08:56.070
- Of course I do.

08:56.100 --> 08:58.800
Glinda is my wife.

09:00.840 --> 09:02.240
Yeah, this was a mistake.

09:02.280 --> 09:04.020
I shouldn't have come.

09:04.040 --> 09:05.140
- Lucas.

09:07.180 --> 09:09.240
Lucas!

09:14.720 --> 09:16.750
- Oh, Roan.

09:16.790 --> 09:18.750
I've missed you so.

10:54.920 --> 10:57.150
- We need a doctor.
Her baby's breached.

10:57.190 --> 10:58.420
- Ah!
- Come on.

10:58.460 --> 10:59.430
- No.

10:59.460 --> 11:02.000
- Ah.

11:04.930 --> 11:07.300
- We have a baby coming,
so you can either kill me now

11:07.330 --> 11:08.360
or you can go
and tell Glinda

11:08.400 --> 11:09.460
to bring her ass down here

11:09.500 --> 11:10.800
with some hot water
and some towels.

11:10.840 --> 11:12.540
Your choice.

11:12.570 --> 11:15.800
- Gah!
Aah.

11:15.840 --> 11:18.510
Ahh.

11:21.480 --> 11:24.010
Ah.

11:34.490 --> 11:36.320
- Good morning, sir.

11:36.360 --> 11:37.930
Your breakfast.

11:37.970 --> 11:39.940
- Where's the Princess?
- Forgive me, sir,

11:39.970 --> 11:43.440
but her Ladyship
is now Queen.

11:43.470 --> 11:46.230
- Right, yeah.

11:46.270 --> 11:48.500
- Would you like us
to draw you a bath?

11:48.540 --> 11:50.940
- A bath?
- The Queen often enjoys

11:50.980 --> 11:53.390
a bath after her meals.

11:55.280 --> 11:56.480
Of course, sir.

11:56.520 --> 11:58.590
I do apologize.

12:01.020 --> 12:02.420
- Will the Queen
be joining me?

12:02.460 --> 12:04.930
- Not in the bath, sir.

12:04.960 --> 12:07.370
- No, for breakfast.

12:07.390 --> 12:11.260
- Not likely, but if you're not
hungry and don't fancy a bath,

12:11.300 --> 12:15.540
then perhaps we could simply
oil your odd parts.

12:36.320 --> 12:37.650
- What is this place?

12:37.690 --> 12:39.590
- The crypt of
our sacred temple.

12:39.630 --> 12:43.540
A place not even The Wizard
knows about.

12:43.560 --> 12:47.400
- What are those?
- Reliquaries.

12:47.430 --> 12:50.300
Where every fallen sorceress
is remained.

12:52.340 --> 12:53.610
- Are those their ashes?

12:53.640 --> 12:55.600
- Their spells.

12:55.640 --> 12:57.510
When a witch dies,
we don't preserve their body.

12:57.540 --> 13:00.010
We preserve their magic.

13:03.050 --> 13:07.050
This is all that is left
of my sister.

13:07.090 --> 13:10.560
Mistress of the Eastern Wood,
most Merciful and Stern.

13:10.590 --> 13:12.020
- Did we come here to pray?

13:12.060 --> 13:13.670
- Witches don't pray
and wait for answers.

13:13.690 --> 13:15.060
We act.

13:15.100 --> 13:16.700
- So...

13:16.730 --> 13:19.470
- So...

13:19.500 --> 13:21.670
I want you to drink her.
- What?

13:21.700 --> 13:23.570
- You want power, don't you?

13:23.600 --> 13:25.070
This is how you get it.

13:25.110 --> 13:27.010
- I'm not drinking
a witch's insides.

13:27.040 --> 13:28.970
- You want revenge
for your parents.

13:29.010 --> 13:30.980
You want to destroy
The Wizard,

13:31.010 --> 13:34.510
then taste my sister's magic.

13:38.450 --> 13:40.720
- Will I be able to turn myself
back into a boy?

13:40.750 --> 13:42.550
- If this works,
you can turn yourself into

13:42.590 --> 13:44.400
a tomato for all I care.

13:44.420 --> 13:46.020
- If?

13:46.060 --> 13:50.070
- No one's ever
done this before.

13:50.100 --> 13:53.340
- But if something happens,
you can help, right?

14:18.460 --> 14:20.570
- It's all right, Tip.
Let it in.

14:28.140 --> 14:29.510
- Wait, wait, wait, wait.

14:34.610 --> 14:36.450
Go back!

14:45.420 --> 14:46.660
- Kill him!

15:12.710 --> 15:16.240
- Tip?

15:16.280 --> 15:18.180
Wake up.

15:18.220 --> 15:19.720
Wake up.

15:19.750 --> 15:22.450
Tip, wake up!

15:22.490 --> 15:24.160
Tip!

15:24.190 --> 15:26.690
No, no.

15:38.310 --> 15:39.810
- Ah, sir.
Would you like to

15:39.840 --> 15:41.580
take in the great lawn,
perhaps?

15:41.610 --> 15:44.680
Or go for a carriage ride?

15:44.710 --> 15:48.480
I'll give you
a moment to decide.

15:50.620 --> 15:52.690
- I'd prefer to see the Queen.

15:52.720 --> 15:54.830
- Oh, I'm afraid
that's not possible, sir.

15:54.850 --> 15:57.450
- Her Highness
is very much occupied

15:57.490 --> 15:59.290
with the arrangements
for her father's funeral

15:59.330 --> 16:01.700
and the arrival
of the armaments.

16:01.730 --> 16:03.600
Guns, in the modern
vernacular.

16:03.630 --> 16:05.660
Ordered by The Wizard,
built by some of

16:05.700 --> 16:07.340
our finest craftspeople.

16:07.370 --> 16:08.710
- I'm sure the Queen
can spare a moment.

16:08.740 --> 16:11.110
- Sir, you can't
go in there.

16:11.140 --> 16:13.110
- Langwidere.

16:13.140 --> 16:15.670
- Jack, you cannot be in here.

16:15.710 --> 16:17.350
- I-I wasn't trying to...

16:17.380 --> 16:19.820
- We have plans
that must be our own.

16:22.350 --> 16:23.460
- Right.

16:26.620 --> 16:29.130
I guess I'll just take
a carriage ride, then.

16:34.490 --> 16:35.590
- So, the bullets go in here?

16:35.630 --> 16:36.870
- Yes, Your Highness.

16:38.870 --> 16:41.170
- And this comes
directly out of here.

16:54.680 --> 16:56.680
Eat.

17:46.570 --> 17:47.870
- We need a doctor.

17:47.900 --> 17:49.660
- There are no doctors here.

17:49.700 --> 17:51.470
- Look, if her baby's
not turned around...

17:51.500 --> 17:53.540
- Mother and child may die.

17:53.570 --> 17:55.970
- No!

17:56.010 --> 17:57.580
- Do you have anything
for her pain?

17:57.610 --> 17:59.470
Alcohol or opiate?

17:59.510 --> 18:00.680
- You have training
in medicine?

18:00.710 --> 18:01.780
- Some, but I can't... I can't...

18:01.810 --> 18:03.210
I can't do this by myself.

18:06.750 --> 18:09.450
What do you need her to do?

18:09.490 --> 18:10.700
- Get underneath
and arch her back.

18:13.660 --> 18:14.890
Come on, lift her.

18:14.930 --> 18:16.570
- Hold her back.
Come on.

18:16.600 --> 18:18.570
Okay, now put your arms
right here.

18:18.600 --> 18:21.510
And push.

18:21.530 --> 18:22.630
I'm gonna try
and turn this baby around,

18:22.670 --> 18:24.780
but without medication...

18:31.540 --> 18:33.440
Oh.

18:34.580 --> 18:36.980
- Her pain has been relieved.

18:37.020 --> 18:39.620
What else do you require?

18:42.290 --> 18:44.600
- Why are you here?

18:44.620 --> 18:47.020
- I heard screaming.

18:47.060 --> 18:48.500
- I need your knife.

18:53.900 --> 18:55.730
Aah.

18:55.770 --> 18:56.910
- Noa, I'm gonna need you
to push, all right?

18:56.940 --> 18:58.540
You're gonna feel
a quick shot of pain

18:58.570 --> 18:59.870
and after that,
I'm gonna need you to push.

18:59.910 --> 19:01.780
It's the last one
and I need you to be strong.

19:01.810 --> 19:02.950
- Mm.
- Push, it's coming,

19:02.980 --> 19:04.620
I can see it.

19:04.640 --> 19:07.640
Go!

19:08.680 --> 19:11.050
- Push!
Go, push!

19:11.080 --> 19:12.680
You're doing great.

19:12.720 --> 19:14.560
You're doing great.
Gimme one more.

19:14.590 --> 19:15.960
One more push.

19:15.990 --> 19:17.060
Push!

19:17.090 --> 19:18.930
Push.

19:18.960 --> 19:20.670
It's coming now.
I can see it.

19:20.690 --> 19:23.890
Aah.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.570
Gimme the towel.

19:27.600 --> 19:29.960
Is it okay?
- Yes, yes.

19:30.000 --> 19:30.970
It's beautiful.

19:33.070 --> 19:34.600
- Oh...

19:34.640 --> 19:36.040
- It's beautiful, Noa.

19:43.880 --> 19:46.980
- Leave us, Roan.

19:47.020 --> 19:48.630
Leave us!

19:51.060 --> 19:52.660
- Just breathe, Noa.

19:55.700 --> 19:59.070
- Ohh.
Oh.

20:50.450 --> 20:53.980
- I see winter hasn't
taken your roses.

20:54.020 --> 20:57.120
- Is that a metaphor?

20:57.160 --> 21:00.130
- You won't look at me.

21:00.160 --> 21:03.070
- What's the point?

21:03.100 --> 21:05.070
You're not even here.

21:11.540 --> 21:15.080
- I'm trying.

21:17.980 --> 21:20.080
That's what hurts.

21:23.520 --> 21:27.090
How did you feel when
you witnessed that birth?

21:27.120 --> 21:29.530
- Alone.

21:29.560 --> 21:33.430
- Because you knew it was
something we could never share.

21:35.600 --> 21:37.570
- Because I was...

21:37.600 --> 21:38.900
I was neither with you...

21:38.930 --> 21:41.630
- Nor with her.

21:46.770 --> 21:50.040
Two years ago,
when you traded

21:50.080 --> 21:53.620
your old life
for a new one with me,

21:53.650 --> 21:56.520
we promised to keep
our secrets from the world.

21:56.550 --> 21:58.020
But never from each other.

21:58.050 --> 22:00.650
- Glinda, you...

22:00.690 --> 22:03.160
you can't hold me accountable.

22:03.190 --> 22:06.700
- My spell didn't
make you a different man.

22:06.730 --> 22:09.470
I took your memory,
not your heart.

22:09.500 --> 22:12.240
- Yes, yes.
And with your spell lifted,

22:12.260 --> 22:14.760
all my old feelings return.

22:17.270 --> 22:19.740
I do love you.

22:19.770 --> 22:21.140
- But?

22:23.640 --> 22:26.110
- We can't live like this.

22:31.280 --> 22:35.050
- We won't have to.

22:35.090 --> 22:38.160
War is upon us.

22:38.190 --> 22:42.720
A thousand soldiers
left Emerald City yesterday.

22:42.760 --> 22:46.260
Your life or death
will depend on

22:46.300 --> 22:48.970
which side you choose.

23:08.620 --> 23:10.720
- Make sure the camp
is protected.

23:10.760 --> 23:13.130
I'll take the battalion to Ev
and retrieve the weapons.

23:13.160 --> 23:14.670
We'll be back
before sunrise.

23:14.690 --> 23:16.790
- Sir?
- Go.

23:16.830 --> 23:18.000
Move out!

23:18.030 --> 23:19.130
- Moving out!

23:42.890 --> 23:44.760
- Jane.

23:44.790 --> 23:47.620
'Tis I, Jack of Ev.

23:47.660 --> 23:49.620
- Well.

23:49.660 --> 23:51.860
You're certainly a prize.

23:51.900 --> 23:54.070
- I'm certainly something.

23:55.230 --> 23:58.200
Living a life
fit for a king.

23:58.240 --> 24:00.650
Courtesy of the Queen.

24:00.670 --> 24:03.770
- You're with Langwidere?

24:03.810 --> 24:05.170
Well, what about Tip?

24:05.210 --> 24:06.770
- Tip?

24:06.810 --> 24:09.080
We were just friends.

24:09.120 --> 24:11.660
Now I don't know what we are.

24:11.680 --> 24:15.250
With Langwidere it's so simple.
She owns me.

24:20.160 --> 24:21.730
Are you going on a trip?

24:21.760 --> 24:24.060
- Closing up shop.

24:24.100 --> 24:26.100
My position here
has been terminated.

24:26.130 --> 24:27.660
- What?
On whose authority?

24:27.700 --> 24:29.300
- Your Highness.

24:29.340 --> 24:32.680
- No, she knows you saved me.
Salvaged me.

24:32.710 --> 24:34.680
- I'm not certain you were in
the forefront of her mind

24:34.710 --> 24:36.680
when it happened.

24:36.710 --> 24:39.780
She asked me to
make her weapons.

24:39.810 --> 24:43.680
I refused, so she fired me.

24:43.720 --> 24:45.220
- Guns?

24:45.250 --> 24:48.080
- A line I refuse to cross.

24:48.120 --> 24:50.120
- Even so,
she can't release you.

24:50.160 --> 24:52.100
I won't let it happen.

24:52.120 --> 24:54.760
- Oh, dear Jack.

24:56.860 --> 25:01.200
When we first met, you were
afraid you'd lost your heart.

25:03.340 --> 25:05.810
It's not possible.

25:18.380 --> 25:21.850
- If you're gonna kill me,
might as well just do it now.

25:21.890 --> 25:26.830
- Funny, I thought it was you
who were here to do the killing.

25:26.860 --> 25:29.970
Ironic, considering
what I just witnessed.

25:30.000 --> 25:34.440
I understand you saved
my husband, as well.

25:34.470 --> 25:36.810
- Where's Sylvie?
- Sylvie?

25:36.840 --> 25:38.980
- Yes.
The girl I came here with.

25:39.010 --> 25:40.880
I don't know her real name.
- Oh.

25:40.910 --> 25:43.720
Seems you don't know anyone's.

25:45.340 --> 25:49.280
- You don't seriously think
she's gonna be a soldier.

25:49.320 --> 25:51.420
- It's hard to tell.

25:51.450 --> 25:55.280
We train them
as best we can, but...

25:55.320 --> 25:58.720
some are more resilient
than others.

26:09.300 --> 26:11.930
- What's happened to them?

26:11.970 --> 26:15.800
- Pushed beyond their limits,
I'm afraid.

26:15.840 --> 26:19.010
The tragic consequence
of our quest for survival.

26:21.350 --> 26:22.920
- You did this.

26:22.950 --> 26:24.860
Like every young woman,

26:24.880 --> 26:27.750
a witch cannot harness
the whole of her powers

26:27.790 --> 26:29.890
until she comes of age.

26:29.920 --> 26:31.720
What we asked
of these girls

26:31.760 --> 26:34.900
was simply
beyond their capacity.

26:34.930 --> 26:39.470
But Dorothy,
perhaps you can help them.

26:39.500 --> 26:41.470
- I'm not a physician.

26:41.500 --> 26:44.930
- The Wizard must believe
you have some capability,

26:44.970 --> 26:47.740
or he wouldn't have
put you on me.

26:47.770 --> 26:51.440
You've saved others.
Save them.

26:51.480 --> 26:52.780
- How many more are you
gonna lose before...

26:52.810 --> 26:56.310
- All, if necessary.

26:56.350 --> 26:59.360
For 20 years,
I've watched your Wizard

26:59.390 --> 27:02.330
dazzle the masses
with his science.

27:02.350 --> 27:05.790
If it were up to him,
every witch in Oz

27:05.830 --> 27:07.970
would've gone the way
of extinction.

27:07.990 --> 27:12.530
But unlike those who betrayed
their own for his favor,

27:12.560 --> 27:16.300
I've always
seen through his lie.

27:16.340 --> 27:18.980
Science is not magic.

27:19.010 --> 27:22.350
We are.
We are the magic.

27:22.370 --> 27:24.770
And the magic is Oz.

27:28.880 --> 27:32.410
And you will find a way
to save these girls.

27:32.450 --> 27:35.950
Or you will not
save yourself.

29:08.410 --> 29:11.910
- Good evening, sister.

29:11.950 --> 29:14.080
Pleasant flight?

29:14.120 --> 29:16.380
- Yes.

29:16.420 --> 29:19.290
Yes.

29:19.330 --> 29:23.200
With the moon so close,
the illumination...

29:23.230 --> 29:25.340
- That is not good news.

29:25.360 --> 29:26.890
But when you appear,

29:26.930 --> 29:29.400
there seldom is.

29:29.440 --> 29:32.940
- I've come
to offer you a gift.

29:32.970 --> 29:35.000
A very special gift.

29:37.380 --> 29:39.080
Me.

29:39.110 --> 29:42.680
- What poison is running
through your veins?

29:42.710 --> 29:45.010
- None.

29:45.050 --> 29:47.180
I swear, I'm as clear
as I've ever been,

29:47.220 --> 29:50.160
and I want you to know that...

29:50.190 --> 29:51.330
I forgive you.

29:51.360 --> 29:53.330
- You forgive me?

29:53.360 --> 29:55.700
- For hiding my own mother
from me.

29:55.730 --> 29:58.040
- I couldn't trust you.

29:58.060 --> 30:01.700
- I know I've been
dishonorable,

30:01.730 --> 30:04.530
shameful.

30:04.570 --> 30:06.400
But now I need her.

30:08.440 --> 30:11.070
I need my mother.

30:11.110 --> 30:13.940
- And if I told you
where she was,

30:13.980 --> 30:16.380
you wouldn't run and tell
The Wizard, would you?

30:16.420 --> 30:18.160
- No.

30:18.180 --> 30:20.450
No, I swear.

30:20.490 --> 30:22.560
I stand before you anew.

30:22.590 --> 30:25.260
Clean,
ready to redeem myself.

30:25.290 --> 30:27.450
Ready to serve you
and our mother.

30:30.500 --> 30:33.740
- When you were
a little girl,

30:33.770 --> 30:36.740
Mother South favored you.

30:36.770 --> 30:39.480
Of all of our sisters,
you were the one

30:39.510 --> 30:42.310
destined to take her place.

30:42.340 --> 30:44.370
Did you know that?

30:44.410 --> 30:48.480
Did you know that
she saw you as her heir?

30:48.510 --> 30:51.480
Not me, not East.

30:51.520 --> 30:53.220
You.

30:55.390 --> 30:58.360
- Where is she?

30:58.390 --> 31:02.490
- In a place safe from all those
who would do her harm,

31:02.530 --> 31:04.370
including you.

31:04.400 --> 31:06.140
- Please!

31:09.170 --> 31:13.580
- You've snuffed out
all the light in you.

31:13.610 --> 31:15.580
You're just a void.

31:23.050 --> 31:26.020
- Oh, Jack, thank goodness
you're still awake.

31:26.050 --> 31:29.080
Today has been
the most relentless day.

31:29.120 --> 31:32.420
I know I'm queen,
but still.

31:32.460 --> 31:37.570
Is everyone really
that crippled?

31:37.600 --> 31:40.170
- I-I didn't mean...
- What did you mean?

31:40.200 --> 31:43.140
- Only that I've been waiting
all day to be with you.

31:43.170 --> 31:45.440
- How could you be
so heartless to Jane?

31:45.470 --> 31:47.200
- Please, Jack,
no more politics.

31:47.240 --> 31:50.110
- That woman gave her life
to you.

31:50.140 --> 31:52.410
To your father.
All her waking hours.

31:52.440 --> 31:54.080
- She said no to me.

31:54.110 --> 31:56.340
- So what?
You can't just enjoy people

31:56.380 --> 31:58.110
when it suits you,
use them up

31:58.150 --> 31:59.180
and toss them aside.

31:59.220 --> 32:00.660
- People serve a purpose.

32:00.690 --> 32:02.660
For business and for pleasure.
- No.

32:02.690 --> 32:04.660
We don't all exist
for your benefit.

32:04.690 --> 32:08.160
- You exist because
Jane was paid to rebuild you.

32:08.190 --> 32:09.820
By me.
The fact that I've developed

32:09.860 --> 32:12.330
feelings for you does not make
you any less my property.

32:12.360 --> 32:14.300
- Oh, so the only way you can
love something is to own it?

32:14.330 --> 32:17.530
- How else do you know
it's yours?

32:20.540 --> 32:24.120
How can you think that way?

32:24.140 --> 32:27.510
- It's true.

32:27.550 --> 32:29.850
I can prove it.

32:29.880 --> 32:32.210
- Then prove it.

32:34.220 --> 32:36.220
- You're free.

32:39.590 --> 32:42.360
I release my hold on you.

32:44.530 --> 32:48.100
Will you leave me
like everyone else?

33:05.380 --> 33:07.510
- Shh.
It's okay.

33:22.200 --> 33:23.500
Another one?

33:26.270 --> 33:28.370
- She simply pushed herself
too hard.

33:28.410 --> 33:30.510
- No, you pushed her
too hard.

33:33.210 --> 33:34.640
- Glinda thought
you could help them.

33:34.680 --> 33:37.410
- Well, Glinda's wrong
about everything.

33:40.590 --> 33:44.160
Is that what
you're gonna do to Sylvie?

33:44.190 --> 33:45.420
- We need to stop The Wizard.

33:45.460 --> 33:47.430
- Well, this isn't the way.

33:52.260 --> 33:54.300
Look, I've...
Look, I've lost you,

33:54.330 --> 33:58.270
and I accept that.

33:58.300 --> 33:59.700
But not Sylvie.

34:01.740 --> 34:04.440
- It's out of our hands,
Dorothy.

34:04.480 --> 34:07.550
- No, it isn't.

34:07.580 --> 34:10.690
- Dorothy?
Dorothy!

34:37.780 --> 34:38.980
Aah... oh!

34:52.719 --> 34:54.719
- Dorothy, stop.

34:54.760 --> 34:57.690
Stop!

34:57.730 --> 34:59.800
You'll have to kill me first.

35:13.680 --> 35:16.290
Why aren't you
going after her?

35:16.320 --> 35:19.720
Roan!
Roan!

35:52.950 --> 35:54.980
- Sylvie.

35:55.020 --> 35:57.280
Sylvie, we need to go.

36:00.960 --> 36:02.370
Come on,
we need to go now.

36:05.960 --> 36:08.830
Come on, Sylvie.

36:08.870 --> 36:11.640
Sylvie, it's me.
Come on.

36:29.390 --> 36:34.670
- The man I loved
would have gutted her.

36:34.690 --> 36:37.990
Would've torn her open
to protect me.

36:38.030 --> 36:42.040
- Then bring that man back,
Glinda.

36:42.070 --> 36:45.040
- Only you can do that.

36:45.070 --> 36:46.670
I lifted my spell.

36:46.710 --> 36:49.680
- Your spell was worthless.

36:51.840 --> 36:54.410
It's hers
that I can't break.

36:58.050 --> 36:59.020
I've tried.

36:59.050 --> 37:01.820
For you, for us, and I...

37:01.850 --> 37:03.820
And I can't just...

37:05.460 --> 37:09.000
Please, just use...
Use whatever magic you have.

37:09.030 --> 37:11.130
Just...

37:11.160 --> 37:12.390
just rip it...

37:12.430 --> 37:15.430
Rip it out of me, please.

37:22.470 --> 37:25.740
- You must do that.

37:31.420 --> 37:34.060
- Take my life.

37:34.090 --> 37:35.960
- Hers.

37:39.990 --> 37:41.690
Take her life,

37:41.730 --> 37:44.130
and your heart will be free.

37:48.170 --> 37:52.140
Do it, or I will.

38:51.960 --> 38:55.000
- On behalf of
Queen Langwidere,

38:55.030 --> 38:57.760
the Kingdom of Ev
welcomes you,

38:57.800 --> 39:02.570
Great and Powerful
Wizard of Oz.

39:02.610 --> 39:05.180
- Are my weapons
at the ready?

39:05.210 --> 39:07.870
- Quite.

39:07.910 --> 39:09.210
Guards!

39:16.990 --> 39:18.900
- You're joking.

39:26.800 --> 39:30.170
- Eamonn, is it true?

39:30.200 --> 39:33.030
War is coming?

39:33.070 --> 39:35.870
- Soon.

40:13.980 --> 40:17.220
- Who taught you
that song, sister?

40:17.250 --> 40:20.160
Why, The Wizard did.

40:22.250 --> 40:24.950
Would you sing it to us
one last time?

40:27.130 --> 40:30.170
Of course...
Of course, my dear.

40:30.200 --> 40:33.000
But drink up.
Drink up so that

40:33.030 --> 40:37.000
you... you may fight without fear.

40:44.040 --> 40:45.910
I'm scared.

40:45.940 --> 40:49.580
I'm scared, sister.
I don't want to die.

41:08.370 --> 41:13.140
You have nothing
to be scared of.

41:13.170 --> 41:17.600
You have magic
to protect you.

41:59.790 --> 42:01.760
Tip.

42:05.990 --> 42:07.350
- It worked.
