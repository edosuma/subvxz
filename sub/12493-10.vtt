WEBVTT

00:04.709 --> 00:05.792
Thanks for the ride home.

00:05.875 --> 00:07.667
I've never been on a motorcycle before.

00:07.750 --> 00:10.375
Were you scared?
You were holding on pretty tight.

00:10.458 --> 00:13.250
Yeah, but that wasn't
because I was scared.

00:15.542 --> 00:17.375
Anyway, see you tomorrow night
at the movies?

00:17.458 --> 00:19.750
Yeah, yeah, for sure.
What time do you want me to pick you up?

00:20.750 --> 00:22.250
Pick me up?

00:23.166 --> 00:25.583
Um, you know what?
You don't have to do that.

00:25.667 --> 00:27.417
We can just, we'll meet at the mall.

00:27.500 --> 00:28.875
That way you don't have to come here.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.959
- We'll just meet there.
- Well--

00:31.083 --> 00:32.583
at the mall.

00:33.667 --> 00:36.333
Okay, but maybe we could just,
like, go in and hang out

00:36.417 --> 00:37.834
- for a little while.
- No.

00:37.917 --> 00:40.917
Derek, no. If we hang out now,

00:41.041 --> 00:42.583
what will we have to talk about tomorrow,

00:44.333 --> 00:46.041
at the mall?

00:47.667 --> 00:48.917
Well, maybe we could--

00:49.041 --> 00:51.208
Save it for the mall.

00:53.125 --> 00:55.500
Okay, well, I'll see you later.

00:55.583 --> 00:57.166
All right, bye.

01:08.000 --> 01:09.458
- Who's the guy?
- What?

01:10.959 --> 01:11.959
What guy?

01:12.959 --> 01:15.208
The guy you're trying to hide
from Mom and Dad.

01:15.959 --> 01:17.333
I'm not trying

01:17.417 --> 01:19.000
to hide anybody from anyone.

01:19.125 --> 01:21.250
Teddy, let's not play this game.

01:21.333 --> 01:24.583
We all know there's a guy.
We all know he has a motorcycle.

01:24.667 --> 01:26.792
And we all know I have photos.

01:29.709 --> 01:30.834
So what do I care?

01:32.000 --> 01:34.166
You care because I can't be trusted

01:34.250 --> 01:35.834
with information like this.

01:36.750 --> 01:38.375
Gabby Gabe they call me.

01:39.375 --> 01:42.333
Okay, just tell me what you want, Gabby.

01:44.375 --> 01:46.166
I got into a little trouble at school.

01:46.250 --> 01:48.792
And now my teacher wants to talk
with my parents.

01:48.875 --> 01:50.291
So what does that have to do with me?

01:51.250 --> 01:53.250
Funny you should ask, Teddy.

01:53.959 --> 01:55.750
Or should I say "Mom"?

01:56.709 --> 01:59.041
Oh, no, no, no, no.

01:59.125 --> 02:01.041
It can totally work.

02:01.125 --> 02:03.625
Miss Monroe is old
and has terrible eyesight.

02:04.208 --> 02:05.709
No, that's crazy.

02:05.750 --> 02:07.458
I'm not gonna pretend to be Mom.

02:09.166 --> 02:10.959
Here's an interesting photo.

02:11.041 --> 02:13.458
I believe they call this a wheelie.

02:16.417 --> 02:19.542
Well, isn't someone
being especially evil today?

02:19.625 --> 02:21.041
I got a good night's sleep.

02:22.250 --> 02:25.250
Okay, so even if I do agree,

02:25.375 --> 02:27.125
who are you gonna get to play dad?

02:27.208 --> 02:28.750
Hey, guys.

02:30.125 --> 02:32.583
PJ, I need you to be
my pretend dad at school.

02:32.667 --> 02:33.917
Sure.

02:34.709 --> 02:37.208
That's it?
You're just gonna do what he says?

02:37.291 --> 02:39.000

Thank you, honey.

03:38.709 --> 03:40.417
Hey, hey, hey, hey!

03:40.500 --> 03:41.709
Didn't you forget something?

03:42.917 --> 03:45.250
I'm not gonna do it every time.

03:48.208 --> 03:52.166
Bob, do you think we should
get something for Charlie to play on,

03:52.250 --> 03:54.917
Like a swing set or slide?

03:55.000 --> 03:56.417
She doesn't need any of that stuff.

03:56.500 --> 03:58.792
She's got all sorts of things
to do back here.

03:58.875 --> 04:01.000
Really? Honey, look at her.

04:03.458 --> 04:05.834
Honey, she's using her imagination.

04:05.917 --> 04:09.750
In her mind, that stick, it's a sword.

04:09.834 --> 04:12.208
It's a magic wand.

04:12.291 --> 04:14.709
- What you got there, Charlie?
- A stick.

04:15.667 --> 04:18.875
Which you are pretending is a...

04:18.959 --> 04:20.250
A stick.

04:32.542 --> 04:35.166
PJ, there's something
we need to talk about.

04:35.250 --> 04:37.959
Oh, no, I knew this was gonna happen.

04:38.667 --> 04:40.875
You wanna break up, right?

04:40.959 --> 04:43.208
Oh, no, no, no,
I think things are going really well.

04:43.291 --> 04:44.542
Me too.

04:46.542 --> 04:49.208
It's just that we've been
seeing each other for three weeks

04:49.333 --> 04:51.208
and we haven't even gone out on
our first date yet.

04:52.125 --> 04:54.083
Oh. Yeah, you're right.

04:54.166 --> 04:55.500
We've only been out with friends.

04:55.583 --> 04:58.417
Yeah, and I think you learn
a lot about a person on a first date.

04:59.125 --> 05:00.166
Like what?

05:00.250 --> 05:02.500
Like sometimes their name.

05:04.667 --> 05:07.750
Or if the relationship is meant to be.

05:07.834 --> 05:09.166
- Really?
- Yeah.

05:09.250 --> 05:13.041
An awesome first date
sets the tone for the entire relationship.

05:13.125 --> 05:14.959
I saw it on a cover of a magazine.

05:16.041 --> 05:18.000
Just the cover? Did you read the article?

05:18.083 --> 05:19.750
No, I'm not a big reader.

05:19.834 --> 05:22.709
We are so right for each other.

05:23.625 --> 05:27.208
Uh-uh-uh. How do I know
until we've had our first date?

05:27.291 --> 05:30.875
Okay, all right, well, where do you wanna
go on our awesome first date?

05:30.959 --> 05:34.208
What date? No one's asked me out yet.

05:34.291 --> 05:36.542
- Hint, hint.
- Right.

05:36.625 --> 05:39.625
Right, okay.
Well, Skyler, would you like to--

05:39.709 --> 05:42.625
Oops, I think my earring just fell out.

05:42.709 --> 05:44.208
- Do you see it?
- Uh-oh.

05:44.250 --> 05:46.250
No. Um, wait.

05:46.375 --> 05:47.709
Wait. Oh, yeah, here it is.

05:47.792 --> 05:49.917
Got it. Uh, where was I?

05:50.000 --> 05:51.834
Oh, yeah. Skyler, would you--

05:51.917 --> 05:54.542
- PJ, what are you doing?
- Dad, I was--

05:54.625 --> 05:56.792
I was about to ask Skyler
a very important question.

05:56.875 --> 05:58.125
You're 17 years old.

05:58.208 --> 06:00.959
You work at Kwikki Chikki.
You wanna ruin your life forever?

06:01.834 --> 06:03.875
I was just gonna ask her out on a date.

06:08.917 --> 06:09.792
Oh.

06:13.000 --> 06:14.125
Have fun.

06:27.750 --> 06:31.000
Li'l Tots forts o' fun.
Charlie is gonna love this.

06:31.083 --> 06:33.458
Now let's rip this baby open
and slap her together.

06:33.542 --> 06:35.875
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Slow down. Slow down.

06:35.959 --> 06:38.750
Before we do any ripping and slapping,

06:39.917 --> 06:41.458
we're gonna read the directions.

06:41.959 --> 06:43.542
Bob, that always takes forever.

06:43.625 --> 06:47.208
Honey, the directions are the difference
between a fort and firewood.

06:49.333 --> 06:50.709
We don't need directions.

06:50.792 --> 06:53.208
All we have to do is look at the picture
on the box and make that.

06:53.291 --> 06:55.667
Just look at the picture and make that.

06:55.750 --> 06:57.125
Well, that explains your cooking.

07:00.500 --> 07:02.208
I'm gonna go get some reading glasses.

07:02.250 --> 07:05.166
Do not touch anything

07:05.250 --> 07:07.125
until I get back.

07:07.208 --> 07:08.583
I won't.

07:08.667 --> 07:09.917
Take your time.

07:12.000 --> 07:15.250
Stop! Whoa, whoa, whoa, stop, stop!
What are you doing?

07:15.375 --> 07:17.500
I'm making these two pieces fit.
I almost got it.

07:17.583 --> 07:19.458
No, no. No more kicking.

07:19.542 --> 07:21.083
We have to read the directions.

07:21.166 --> 07:22.834
We don't have to read the directions

07:22.917 --> 07:26.458
to know that this piece
fits into this piece, pretty much.

07:27.208 --> 07:28.959
- Gimme this.
- No, would you just let me do this.

07:29.041 --> 07:30.583
Gimme this.
You don't know what you're doing,

07:30.667 --> 07:32.083
and somebody might get hurt.

07:35.166 --> 07:37.166
Are you okay?

07:40.208 --> 07:42.250
Because I'm seeing three of you right now

07:42.333 --> 07:44.750
and I don't even wanna see one of you,

07:44.834 --> 07:47.125
I'm gonna let you build this by yourself.

07:47.208 --> 07:48.250
Thank you.

07:49.166 --> 07:50.458
From all of us.

07:58.709 --> 08:02.875
Gabe, are your parents coming or not?

08:03.667 --> 08:06.375
Mrs. Monroe,
how many fingers am I holding up?

08:06.458 --> 08:09.375
- Three.
- Yeah, they're on their way.

08:10.333 --> 08:13.000
- Hello.
- Mom!

08:13.083 --> 08:15.500
Ah, there you are, you little scamp.

08:16.750 --> 08:17.959
Dial it down.

08:18.917 --> 08:20.875
- I'm Mrs. Monroe.
- Teddy: Hi.

08:21.000 --> 08:24.917
- So nice to meet you.
- Yes, Amy Duncan, nurse.

08:25.000 --> 08:26.458
Mother of four. How you doing?

08:27.792 --> 08:28.917
Way down.

08:30.625 --> 08:32.750
There's my husband.

08:34.041 --> 08:35.375
Dad?

08:35.458 --> 08:37.083
Sorry, I'm late, chaps.

08:37.166 --> 08:38.208
I'm Bob.

08:39.125 --> 08:42.083
Mr. Duncan,
I didn't know you were British.

08:42.166 --> 08:44.166
Yeah, neither did Mrs. Duncan.

08:44.250 --> 08:46.500
That's right. I'm British.

08:47.458 --> 08:49.000
What an interesting accent.

08:49.083 --> 08:50.458
What part of England are you from?

08:54.709 --> 08:58.291
Ostrich-shi-shi-shire.

08:58.959 --> 08:59.792
Pardon.

08:59.875 --> 09:01.917
Ostrich-shi-shi-shire.

09:02.000 --> 09:04.375
I don't believe
I've heard of Ostrichshire.

09:04.458 --> 09:06.125
You one "shi" short, love.

09:07.417 --> 09:10.125
Dad, I'm in trouble. Let's focus on that.

09:10.208 --> 09:12.625
Yes, Gabe has been misbehaving

09:12.709 --> 09:14.458
and I thought we should talk about it.

09:14.542 --> 09:16.667
Yes, rest assured,
we are aware of the problem,

09:16.750 --> 09:18.959
and are going to put an end
to this behavior.

09:19.041 --> 09:21.250
Yes, I will be taking the young lad out

09:21.333 --> 09:23.959
to the hollyhock house
where I will Shepherd his pie.

09:25.625 --> 09:27.208
What?

09:27.375 --> 09:30.166
It's just something
they say in ostrich-shi-shi--

09:31.917 --> 09:32.875
Where he's from.

09:40.500 --> 09:41.959
- Hey, Dad.
- Bob: Hey.

09:45.875 --> 09:47.250
Why are you wearing a fake mustache?

09:49.875 --> 09:52.125
Why aren't you wearing one?

09:58.000 --> 10:00.333
I do enjoy our talks, son.

10:02.333 --> 10:04.500
Hey, while we're talking,

10:04.583 --> 10:06.792
what's your idea of a perfect first date?

10:06.875 --> 10:08.583
- First date?
- Yeah.

10:08.667 --> 10:10.083
First date.

10:11.458 --> 10:12.875
No, I'm sorry.

10:12.959 --> 10:14.542
I really need an answer on that mustache.

10:17.250 --> 10:20.250
Fine. I was pretending to be
a British version of you.

10:24.500 --> 10:26.041
So you got a question about dating.

10:29.375 --> 10:32.250
Yeah, I gotta come up
with something great for Skyler,

10:32.333 --> 10:33.750
but I don't have any ideas.

10:33.834 --> 10:36.208
How about a moonlight picnic?

10:36.250 --> 10:38.875
You can drive up into the mountains,
look out over the lights of the city.

10:40.333 --> 10:41.625
- Sounds romantic.
- Bob: Yeah.

10:41.709 --> 10:43.083
- I like it. Thanks, Dad.
- Okay.

10:57.125 --> 10:58.500
- Hey, dad.
- Bob: Hey.

11:03.125 --> 11:04.959
Why are you wearing a fake mustache?

11:06.166 --> 11:08.875
Why aren't you wearing one?

11:16.417 --> 11:17.667
Charlie, before you know it,

11:17.750 --> 11:20.166
you're gonna have something
a lot better than a box to play in.

11:21.000 --> 11:23.375
Now let me just finish off this last nail

11:23.458 --> 11:24.875
and...

11:31.750 --> 11:33.792
Then again, that box looks pretty fun.

11:44.083 --> 11:45.625
- Oh, hey.
- Hey.

11:48.291 --> 11:50.000
- Hey.
- Derek: Hey.

11:51.041 --> 11:53.417
- You look good.
- You look good.

11:54.250 --> 11:55.542
We all look good.

11:55.625 --> 11:56.542
Would you sit down?

11:56.625 --> 11:58.500
Trying to do
the celebrity word scramble here.

11:59.667 --> 12:00.834
Ah, Julia Roberts!

12:05.375 --> 12:07.750
Teddy, I gotta ask you something.

12:08.750 --> 12:12.166
Is there a reason that you didn't want me
to come to your house?

12:12.834 --> 12:14.625
No, what are talking about?

12:15.834 --> 12:17.083
Ryan Reynolds.

12:17.166 --> 12:18.417
Do it in your head.

12:20.291 --> 12:23.000
I don't know.
I kinda got the vibe that maybe

12:23.083 --> 12:25.166
you don't wanna introduce me
to your family.

12:26.000 --> 12:28.542
No, it's not that I don't want them
to meet you.

12:28.625 --> 12:30.875
It's that I don't want them
to meet your motorcycle

12:31.000 --> 12:33.583
and your biker boots
and your leather jacket

12:33.667 --> 12:34.667
with the skull on it.

12:35.750 --> 12:38.208
Teddy, I don't wanna be somebody

12:38.250 --> 12:39.542
you have to hide from your parents.

12:41.375 --> 12:43.166
- Zac Efron!
- Come on!

12:45.208 --> 12:47.375
You know what? I like you the way you are.

12:47.458 --> 12:48.917
That's all that matters.

12:49.000 --> 12:51.417
So come over tomorrow night
and I'll introduce you.

12:51.500 --> 12:53.041
Cool.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.250
- Here you go.
- Thank you, mother.

13:00.417 --> 13:02.000
That's Gabe's mother.

13:02.917 --> 13:05.208
And that's not her husband.

13:05.291 --> 13:06.875
Relax, maybe they're just friends.

13:08.166 --> 13:09.375
Or not.

13:10.959 --> 13:12.041
Diet, mother?

13:12.875 --> 13:15.000
You're 41 years old and single.

13:15.083 --> 13:16.291
Yeah, diet.

13:18.250 --> 13:20.583
- Angelina Jolie!
- Mom!

13:32.667 --> 13:33.667
Ha!

13:34.500 --> 13:35.667
Look at that.

13:35.792 --> 13:37.125
Yeah,

13:37.208 --> 13:39.083
first it was there,

13:39.166 --> 13:40.583
and now it's here.

13:41.709 --> 13:43.834
There, here.

13:43.917 --> 13:46.959
- You actually did this.
- Guess somebody was wrong.

13:47.041 --> 13:49.709
- Charlie, honey, who was wrong?
- Daddy!

13:52.917 --> 13:56.250
Well, Daddy's very impressed.

13:56.333 --> 13:57.917
And a little shocked.

13:58.542 --> 14:01.625
And Mommy is gonna do a victory dance.

14:01.709 --> 14:03.542
♪ I'm right, you're wrong ♪

14:03.625 --> 14:05.959
- ♪ I'm right, you're wrong, I'm right ♪
- All right.

14:07.083 --> 14:08.709
Mm-hmm. Now we're gonna switch it up.

14:08.792 --> 14:10.375
♪ 'Cause you're wrong and I'm right ♪

14:10.458 --> 14:12.250
♪ You're wrong, I'm right, you're wrong ♪

14:12.333 --> 14:15.166
- Going inside now.
- Bye-bye. In Spanish...

14:15.250 --> 14:18.583
♪ Estoy correcto, estoy correcto ♪

14:26.333 --> 14:28.375
- Hi, I'm Tim.
- I'm Bob.

14:29.208 --> 14:30.583
Why are we talking?

14:32.041 --> 14:33.458
Forgot to give this to your wife.

14:34.417 --> 14:35.542
What is it?

14:35.583 --> 14:37.625
It's the bill
for assembling your play structure.

14:38.542 --> 14:39.750
You put that together?

14:40.375 --> 14:42.583
Yup, turned out pretty good, huh?

14:43.041 --> 14:45.959
Couldn't possibly have turned out better.

14:46.834 --> 14:50.125
Well, if you'd like
to reflect your satisfaction with a tip.

14:50.208 --> 14:51.667
- Bye-bye, Tim.
- You know, I take--

15:00.875 --> 15:03.250
How are you enjoying
our first date so far?

15:03.333 --> 15:04.792
Pretty special, right?

15:04.875 --> 15:06.792
This sure is a twisty road.

15:06.875 --> 15:08.750
Which is fine with me 'cause this is fun.

15:15.709 --> 15:16.959
You aren't whooing.

15:17.041 --> 15:19.625
That's because I don't feel very well.

15:19.709 --> 15:22.166
Oh, maybe you're just hungry.
Take something out of the picnic basket.

15:28.083 --> 15:30.125
Or put something in.

15:30.834 --> 15:32.250
Your choice.

15:37.041 --> 15:38.625
Bob: Help!

15:38.709 --> 15:40.709
Bob: Help!

15:40.792 --> 15:42.792
Gabe, Gabe, watch Charlie!

15:46.000 --> 15:48.041
Bob! What happened?

15:48.125 --> 15:49.458
I don't know.

15:49.542 --> 15:52.625
I was just standing here
admiring the swing set,

15:52.709 --> 15:55.417
you know, the one
you put together all by yourself,

15:56.041 --> 15:57.917
and then boom!

15:58.000 --> 15:59.667
The whole thing came down on top of me.

15:59.750 --> 16:01.917
- Are you okay?
- I don't know.

16:02.000 --> 16:04.583
I just, I feel so sleepy.

16:04.667 --> 16:07.000
No, no, no. No, Bob, stay with me.
Stay with me.

16:07.083 --> 16:09.208
Amy, just know that

16:09.250 --> 16:10.625
no matter what happens to me,

16:11.875 --> 16:14.208
I don't blame you
for the way you put this thing together.

16:16.417 --> 16:18.792
- I'm gonna go get help.
- No, no!

16:19.917 --> 16:21.291
Let me.

16:21.375 --> 16:22.709
Tim.

16:26.583 --> 16:29.458
Oh, you know Tim, right?

16:29.542 --> 16:32.125
Of course, I do. Hi, Tim.

16:32.208 --> 16:34.917
- How you doing?
- Hi, Mrs. Duncan.

16:35.000 --> 16:37.000
Bob Duncan,
how dare you scare me like that!

16:37.083 --> 16:39.208
Well, you deserved it for lying to me.

16:39.291 --> 16:41.083
Oh, what? So now I can't lie to you?

16:41.208 --> 16:42.917
I thought we had a good marriage
going here.

16:44.166 --> 16:45.583
Here's the bill for taking it apart.

16:45.667 --> 16:46.667
Thank you.

16:46.750 --> 16:50.000
Oh, could you
put this back together again, please?

16:50.083 --> 16:53.083
Sure, then tomorrow
you want me to come back

16:53.166 --> 16:54.500
and take it apart again?

16:55.500 --> 16:56.667
No.

16:56.750 --> 16:59.250
Gosh, Tim, we're not crazy.

17:09.208 --> 17:11.417
I am so glad
you're giving me a second chance.

17:11.500 --> 17:13.667
Let's just pretend
our first date never happened.

17:13.750 --> 17:14.959
What first date?

17:15.041 --> 17:16.875
The one where
I puked in the picnic basket.

17:16.959 --> 17:19.417
Oh. No, it's an expression.

17:19.500 --> 17:21.750
Puked in the picnic basket's
an expression?

17:21.834 --> 17:23.375
I don't think that's gonna catch on.

17:27.250 --> 17:28.250
Excuse me.

17:33.417 --> 17:35.250
Mrs. Monroe, what are you doing here?

17:35.375 --> 17:38.709
Mr. Duncan,
you've seemed to have lost your accent.

17:39.125 --> 17:40.917
It comes and goes.

17:41.041 --> 17:43.041
Ah, there it is. Pip pip.

17:43.875 --> 17:46.000
And you've lost your mustache too.

17:46.083 --> 17:49.875
That's right. Me mustache went cheerio.

17:49.959 --> 17:52.417
Mr. Duncan, I have disturbing news.

17:52.917 --> 17:54.375
It's about your wife.

17:54.458 --> 17:56.458
Your wife? You have a wife?

17:56.542 --> 17:58.083
- No.
- You don't?

17:58.166 --> 17:59.417
Of course, I do.

18:00.333 --> 18:02.625
- Who are you?
- I'm his girlfriend.

18:02.709 --> 18:04.166
Hey, guys, what's the--

18:05.750 --> 18:07.792
And here she is with her boyfriend?

18:07.875 --> 18:10.750
You're cheating on me?
You're a married woman.

18:10.834 --> 18:12.792
- You're married?
- No. No, no, no.

18:12.875 --> 18:14.417
- You're not?
- Of course, I am.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.625
Uh, Gabe!

18:21.166 --> 18:22.667
Yes, Mother?

18:23.250 --> 18:25.792
I'm starting to see why
you didn't want me to meet your family.

18:26.792 --> 18:29.625
Gabe, Mrs. Monroe has found out

18:29.709 --> 18:31.792
that your father
and I are having problems.

18:32.667 --> 18:36.542
And does she know
that you guys are the reason I misbehave?

18:36.625 --> 18:38.750
Oh, I do now.

18:39.792 --> 18:42.250
Well, maybe some good can come

18:42.333 --> 18:43.500
from all this pain.

18:43.583 --> 18:44.834
Dial it down.

18:45.583 --> 18:49.333
Mrs. Monroe, if you'll excuse us,
this family has some healing to do.

18:49.375 --> 18:53.583
Which I would like to do
just with my parents and their dates.

18:54.458 --> 18:55.583
Well, stay warm, love.

18:55.667 --> 18:57.208
Don't wanna freeze off
your English muffins.

19:01.542 --> 19:03.333
Grandma, grandpa!

19:04.250 --> 19:05.709
What's going on?

19:05.792 --> 19:08.834
I'm Gabe's teacher.
I came to talk to his parents.

19:08.917 --> 19:10.291
We're his parents.

19:12.250 --> 19:14.500
That's right, grandpa. You're my dad.

19:15.875 --> 19:17.625
He thinks he's the president too.

19:19.709 --> 19:22.500
- Who are you?
- Hey, I'm Derek.

19:22.583 --> 19:25.083
- Just a friend.
- Is that your motorcycle?

19:25.166 --> 19:26.166
- Yeah.
- No--

19:26.250 --> 19:27.417
I love motorcycles.

19:28.458 --> 19:30.000
We're dating, me and Derek.

19:30.834 --> 19:32.792
Will you stop throwing that in my face?

19:32.875 --> 19:35.208
- We're done with that part.
- Jolly good.

19:41.917 --> 19:43.000
Hey, Charlie.

19:43.083 --> 19:46.250
Well, we all got grounded
for pretending to be mom and dad,

19:46.333 --> 19:47.834
but there's some good news.

19:47.917 --> 19:50.709
Looking good, Mr. Duncan.

19:50.792 --> 19:52.834
Oh, please, call me Bob.

19:54.417 --> 19:56.959
Yeah, turns out
I was worried about nothing.

19:57.041 --> 19:59.750
My new boyfriend is Dad's new best friend.

20:02.208 --> 20:03.792
Maybe I do have something to worry about.

20:05.250 --> 20:07.125
And things are cool between me and Skyler,

20:07.250 --> 20:09.500
after I explained
I wasn't married to my sister.

20:09.583 --> 20:10.959
Yeah, that would have been awful.

20:11.041 --> 20:13.917
- Talk about puke in the picnic basket.
- Right.

20:15.041 --> 20:17.500
- Teddy: What?
- Oh, it's an expression.

20:17.583 --> 20:19.875
Yeah.

20:24.792 --> 20:26.375
- Whoopsie.
- My bike!

20:28.250 --> 20:31.166
Oh, well, that should put a dent
in the old friendship.

20:32.500 --> 20:33.875
And, uh, of course,

20:33.959 --> 20:36.542
your swing set
has now collapsed three times.

20:37.709 --> 20:39.500
Good luck, Charlie.

20:54.375 --> 20:56.792
- What are you doing?
- Sorry to trouble you, governor,

20:56.875 --> 20:58.750
but I'm visiting the States from the U.K.

20:58.834 --> 21:01.709
And me auto seems to have broken down
in front of your house.

21:02.667 --> 21:04.500
I'm trying to play a video game here.

21:04.583 --> 21:07.208
If there's a funny part to this story,
can we please get to it.

21:08.166 --> 21:09.792
Saucy little bloke, aren't you?

21:10.625 --> 21:13.709
Anyway, may I use your telephone
to ring up the garage?

21:14.041 --> 21:15.083
Get in here.

21:19.667 --> 21:20.834
Gabe, who was at the--

21:26.792 --> 21:29.166
By Jove, you're a handsome lad.

21:30.792 --> 21:32.625
Back at you, British dude.

21:36.000 --> 21:37.917
Wha-- if you're--

21:39.208 --> 21:40.500
What?

21:41.125 --> 21:44.500
Are you by any chance
from ostrich-shi-shi-shire?

21:44.583 --> 21:46.625
Where? Never heard of it.

21:46.709 --> 21:48.375
I'm from ostrich-shi-shi-shi-shire.

21:49.250 --> 21:51.583
Ah, I was one "shi" short.
