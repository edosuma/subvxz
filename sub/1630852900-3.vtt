01:36.696 --> 01:37.997
VERY MUCH IS.

01:38.064 --> 01:39.933
ALSO, IT'S NOTABLE "DICKHEAD"

01:39.999 --> 01:41.067
WAS TOO VULGAR FOR CNN, BUT

01:57.150 --> 01:57.717

ACTUAL WORD TO END BEFORE START

02:37.090 --> 02:40.193
CASTING THE MOVIE.

02:40.260 --> 02:41.027
BUT TO BE FAIR, "YEAH, A LITTLE

02:41.094 --> 02:41.661
INSENSITIVE BUT WE'RE GONNA RUN

02:41.728 --> 02:42.295

02:45.398 --> 02:50.837

02:50.904 --> 02:51.771
THAT'S NOT A NICE THING TO SAY.

02:51.838 --> 02:52.772
AS FOR RUSSIA, THEY'VE RESPONDED

02:52.839 --> 02:55.208

02:55.275 --> 02:56.209
CLAMPING DOWN HARD ON DISSENT

02:56.276 --> 02:56.543
AT HOME.

02:56.609 --> 02:57.176
PUTIN JUST SIGNED A LAW

02:59.379 --> 02:59.846
INDEPENDENT NEWS REPORTING

02:59.913 --> 03:00.480
ABOUT, THE WAR, AND AUTHORITIES

03:00.547 --> 03:06.553
HAVE BLOCKED TWITTER AND

03:06.619 --> 03:09.222
FACEBOOK, AND THREATING TO BLOCK

03:09.289 --> 03:10.490
WIKIPEDIA.

03:14.527 --> 03:15.528

03:15.595 --> 03:16.829
GETTING SOME SPECTACULAR

03:16.896 --> 03:21.034
ANSWERS.

03:21.100 --> 03:21.734
>> Interpreter: I HAVE A

03:21.801 --> 03:24.604
QUESTION.

03:24.671 --> 03:26.406
SPECIAL OPERATIONS.

03:26.472 --> 03:28.007
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

03:28.074 --> 03:29.576
>> GOALS LEAD TO PEACE.

03:29.642 --> 03:30.143
WE DO NOT ATTACK RESIDENTIAL

03:30.209 --> 03:31.811
BUILDINGS.

03:31.878 --> 03:34.080
WE DO NOT HIT CIVILIANS.

03:34.147 --> 03:36.482
WE DO NOT DESTROY SOCIAL

03:36.549 --> 03:36.916
INFRASTRUCTURE.

03:36.983 --> 03:37.850
KINDERGARTEN, SCHOOL, WATER

03:37.917 --> 03:41.721
UTILITIES, SUBSTATIONS.

03:41.788 --> 03:42.355

03:42.422 --> 03:43.056
JUST DONE ALMOST ALL THOSE

03:43.122 --> 03:43.890
THINGS.

03:43.957 --> 03:44.724
RUSSIAN STRIKES HAVE DESTROYED

03:44.791 --> 03:45.358
HOSPITALS, SCHOOLS, AND HOMES.

03:45.425 --> 03:46.092
ALSO I DON'T WANT TO BE GIVING

03:46.159 --> 03:47.026
NOTES TO STATE PROPAGANDA.

03:47.093 --> 03:48.461
BUT IF YOU'RE LYING TO A CHILD'S

03:48.528 --> 03:49.095
FACE, MAYBE CAST A LESS CREEPY

03:49.162 --> 03:50.697
MAN TO DO IT.

03:50.763 --> 03:51.731
MAY I SUGGEST FILM ACTOR

03:51.798 --> 03:53.866
JEREMY RENNER?

03:53.933 --> 03:54.634
PEOPLE SEEM TO WANT HIM INVOLVED

03:54.701 --> 03:56.736
IN THIS SOMEHOW.

03:56.803 --> 03:57.503
AND YET, DESPITE RUSSIA'S

03:57.570 --> 03:59.005
EFFORTS TO CONTROL THE

03:59.072 --> 04:01.007
NARRATIVE, WE CONTINUE TO SEE

04:01.074 --> 04:01.941
PUBLIC PROTESTS AND SOME

04:02.008 --> 04:02.709
RUSSIAN CELEBRITIES,

04:02.775 --> 04:03.876
POLITICIANS, AND EVEN A FEW

04:03.943 --> 04:05.278
OLIGARCHS HAVE CAUTIOUSLY

04:05.345 --> 04:06.646
SPOKEN OUT.

04:06.713 --> 04:08.581
WHICH IS UNDERSTANDABLE,

04:08.648 --> 04:09.782
NOT ONLY IS THE WAR MORALLY

04:09.849 --> 04:11.050
INDEFENSIBLE, BUT THE IMPACTS OF

04:11.117 --> 04:13.353
GLOBAL SANCTIONS ARE NOW BEING

04:13.419 --> 04:13.953
FELT AT EVERY LEVEL OF RUSSIAN

04:14.020 --> 04:14.887
SOCIETY.

04:14.954 --> 04:17.757
THE ECONOMY THERE IS IN FREE

04:17.824 --> 04:19.225
FALL AND JUST WATCH THE LEVEL

04:19.292 --> 04:20.827
OF DESPAIR IN THIS EXCHANGE ON A

04:20.893 --> 04:26.633
RUSSIAN FINANCIAL NETWORK.

04:26.699 --> 04:27.433
>> Interpreter: HELLO.

04:27.500 --> 04:29.736
>> I WON'T SAY GOOD DAY.

04:29.802 --> 04:31.537
>> NO ONE DOES THESE DAYS.

04:31.604 --> 04:34.273
>> JOKES ASIDE, LET'S DO THIS

04:34.340 --> 04:36.242
QUICK.

04:36.309 --> 04:36.643
SENDING REGARDS.

04:36.709 --> 04:40.413
12 TO 13 YEARS AGO, HE DRANK TO

04:40.480 --> 04:42.649
THE DEATH OF THE STOCK MARKET.

04:42.715 --> 04:44.050
DEAR STOCK MARKET, YOU WERE

04:44.117 --> 04:44.884
CLOSE TO US.

04:44.951 --> 04:46.519
YOU ARE INTERESTING TO US.

04:46.586 --> 04:50.056
REST IN PEACE, DEAR COMRADE.

04:50.123 --> 04:50.990
>> John: WOW.

04:51.057 --> 04:51.591
THAT GUY TOASTED THE DEATH OF

04:51.658 --> 04:52.959
THE RUSSIAN STOCK MARKET, SAYING

04:53.026 --> 04:53.593
"YOU WERE CLOSE TO US, YOU WERE

04:53.660 --> 04:54.127
INTERESTING TO US," THEN

04:54.193 --> 04:55.161
CHUGGING SOME SELTZER.

04:55.228 --> 04:56.195
WHICH IS STRIKING, BUT SOUNDS

04:56.262 --> 04:57.163
LESS LIKE HOW YOU'D MOURN A

04:57.230 --> 04:58.264
FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND MORE LIKE

04:58.331 --> 04:59.799
HOW YOU'D GIVE A EULOGY FOR A

04:59.866 --> 05:00.566
CLOWN YOU DON'T KNOW ALL THAT

05:00.633 --> 05:02.101
WELL PERSONALLY.

05:02.168 --> 05:02.935
"YOU WERE CLOSE TO US, YOU WERE

05:03.002 --> 05:07.840
INTERESTING TO US."

05:07.907 --> 05:08.908
KSHHHH.

05:08.975 --> 05:09.442
YET, FOR ALL THE UKRAINIAN

05:09.509 --> 05:10.209
RESISTANCE AND RUSSIAN

05:10.276 --> 05:12.612
DISCONTENT, THE FACT IS,

05:12.679 --> 05:13.079
RUSSIA'S ADVANCING AND

05:13.146 --> 05:13.680
COMMITTING HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES

05:13.746 --> 05:15.248
ALONG THE WAY.

05:15.314 --> 05:16.716
AND IT LOOKS LIKE CASUALTIES ARE

05:16.783 --> 05:17.984
ONLY GOING TO RISE, ESPECIALLY

05:18.051 --> 05:18.985
GIVEN, AFTER A CALL WITH PUTIN

05:19.052 --> 05:20.319
ON THURSDAY, FRENCH PRESIDENT

05:20.386 --> 05:21.788
EMMANUEL MACRON WAS REPORTEDLY

05:21.854 --> 05:23.189
CONVINCED THAT PUTIN WANTS TO

05:23.256 --> 05:25.158
SEIZE THE WHOLE OF UKRAINE AND

05:25.224 --> 05:26.526
THAT "THE WORST IS TO COME."

05:26.592 --> 05:28.428
SO SADLY, WE HAVE NO IDEA WHAT'S

05:28.494 --> 05:29.829
GOING TO HAPPEN NEXT OR JUST HOW

05:29.896 --> 05:33.099
BAD THIS COULD GET.

05:33.166 --> 05:35.134
WHAT DETERMINES THE

05:35.201 --> 05:35.768
OUTCOME HERE MAY NOT SO MUCH BE

05:35.835 --> 05:36.769
UKRAINIAN RESISTANCE OR RUSSIAN

05:36.836 --> 05:40.840
PROPAGANDA, SO MUCH AS ONE MAN'S

05:40.907 --> 05:41.474
DETERMINATION TO BE -- IF I MAY

05:41.541 --> 05:42.809
QUOTE ONE OF THE MOST APPLICABLE

PHRASES IN ANY LANGUAGE--

05:44.243 --> 05:47.046

07:27.613 --> 07:29.115
A VACATION WITH ALL OF HER

07:29.182 --> 07:29.849
FRIENDS, EVERY GOOGLE CALENDAR'S

07:29.916 --> 07:31.184
NIGHTMARE.

07:31.250 --> 07:34.387
AND THAT'S SAYING NOTHING OF THE

07:34.453 --> 07:35.621
M.V.P. OF THAT CLIP:

07:35.688 --> 07:36.923
STEVE HARVEY'S LITTLE GOLDEN

07:36.989 --> 07:39.959
GAVEL WHICH HE IS MAKING A FULL

07:40.026 --> 07:41.694
FIVE COURSE MEAL OUT OF.

07:41.761 --> 07:42.895
HONESTLY, I WISH I HAD ONE.

07:42.962 --> 07:44.263
WAIT, HOLD ON, I DO.

07:44.330 --> 07:44.864
CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP-CLOMP,

07:44.931 --> 07:45.464
ORDER IN THE COURT.

07:45.531 --> 07:46.332
CLOMP CLOMP!

07:46.399 --> 07:48.234
BIG MAN, TINY HAMMER ALERT.

07:48.301 --> 07:49.068
CLOMPITY CLOMP!

07:49.135 --> 07:50.136
I'M A GAVEL GUY NOW.

07:50.203 --> 07:52.371
GET USED TO IT.

07:52.438 --> 07:53.906
SADLY, THOUGH, NOT ALL COURTS

07:53.973 --> 07:54.707
ARE AS INFALLIBLE AS STEVE

07:54.774 --> 07:55.508
HARVEY'S.

07:55.575 --> 07:57.376
AS WE'VE DISCUSSED MANY TIMES ON

07:57.443 --> 07:58.344
THIS SHOW, TRIALS CAN GO AWRY

07:58.411 --> 07:59.979
FOR A NUMBER OF REASONS, FROM

08:00.046 --> 08:01.447
PROSECUTORIAL MISCONDUCT TO

08:01.514 --> 08:02.315
UNDERFUNDED AND OVERWORKED

08:02.381 --> 08:03.149
PUBLIC DEFENDERS, TO FLAWED JURY

08:03.216 --> 08:04.183
SELECTION, TO HOW WE ELECT

08:04.250 --> 08:04.817
JUDGES, TO PROBLEMS WITH

08:04.884 --> 08:05.718
MANDATORY MINIMUMS, ALL THE WAY

08:05.785 --> 08:09.055
TO FLIMSY JIZZ ANALYSIS.

08:09.121 --> 08:10.656
LUCKILY, AS POP CULTURE HAS

08:10.723 --> 08:11.591
TAUGHT US, THERE'S A REMEDY FOR

08:11.657 --> 08:13.159
WRONGFUL CONVICTIONS, BUILT

08:13.226 --> 08:19.031
RIGHT INTO THE SYSTEM.

08:19.098 --> 08:20.967
>> IT ISN'T OVER.

08:21.033 --> 08:23.369
>> I WILL GET THE CONVICTIONS

08:23.436 --> 08:24.837
OVERTURNED ON THE APPEAL.

08:24.904 --> 08:26.806
>> I WILL APPEAL THIS ALL THE

08:26.873 --> 08:27.373
WAY TO THE SUPREME COURT.

08:27.440 --> 08:30.076
>> WE WILL APPEAL THIS.

08:30.142 --> 08:33.679
>> John: OKAY, HOLD ON.

08:33.746 --> 08:34.480
LET'S JUST ACKNOWLEDGE JULIANNA

08:34.547 --> 08:35.781
MARGULIES THERE, BECAUSE SHE IS

08:35.848 --> 08:36.582
CAPITAL "A" ACTING THERE, DOING

08:36.649 --> 08:37.149
ABSOLUTELY EVERYTHING WITH

08:37.216 --> 08:37.583
ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.

08:37.650 --> 08:38.751
JULIANNA MARGULIES IS DOING MORE

08:38.818 --> 08:40.086
IN THIS THREE SECOND CLIP THAN

08:40.152 --> 08:41.854
THE ROCK HAS DONE IN HIS ENTIRE

08:41.921 --> 08:42.088
CAREER.

08:42.154 --> 08:44.457
YOU HEARD ME.

08:44.524 --> 08:45.791
I SAID WHAT I SAID.

08:45.858 --> 08:46.492
THE ROCK HAS

08:46.559 --> 08:48.995
OFFICIALLY BEEN CLOMPED.

08:49.061 --> 08:50.630
THE IDEA THAT YOU CAN SIMPLY

08:50.696 --> 08:51.964
FIGHT A WRONGFUL CONVICTION AND

08:52.031 --> 08:53.699
GET EXONERATED RUNS DEEP.

08:53.766 --> 08:54.967
BUT THE TRUTH IS, IT'S FAR MORE

08:55.034 --> 08:56.669
DIFFICULT THAN YOU MIGHT EXPECT.

08:56.736 --> 08:58.104
EVEN IF THERE'S COMPELLING

08:58.170 --> 09:01.307
EVIDENCE YOU'RE INNOCENT.

09:01.374 --> 09:01.874
TAKE LAMAR JOHNSON, WHO WAS

09:01.941 --> 09:03.242
CONVICTED IN 1995 OF MURDER.

09:03.309 --> 09:03.876
BUT BETWEEN HIS CONVICTION, AND

09:03.943 --> 09:05.144
HIS SENTENCING, ONE OF THE REAL

09:05.211 --> 09:06.746
KILLERS WROTE HIM A LETTER THAT

09:06.812 --> 09:08.347
YOU'D THINK WOULD'VE CHANGED

09:08.414 --> 09:12.418
EVERYTHING.

09:12.485 --> 09:13.619
>> THE LETTER OPENS BY SAYING

09:13.686 --> 09:15.788
IT'S PRETTY MUCH MESSED UP

09:15.855 --> 09:17.623
JOHNSON WAS CONVICTED WHEN HE

09:17.690 --> 09:18.324
DIDN'T DO ANYTHING AND THAT

09:18.391 --> 09:19.926
EXPLAINS WHO DID IT AND WHAT

09:19.992 --> 09:20.626
HAPPENED.

09:20.693 --> 09:21.994
BELIEVE IT OR NOT, EVEN WITH THE

09:22.061 --> 09:25.598
LETTER, THIS IS STILL THE

09:25.665 --> 09:27.333
JUSTICE SYSTEM TRYING TO FIGURE

09:27.400 --> 09:29.302
OUT HOW TO FREE AN INNOCENT MAN.

09:29.368 --> 09:30.469
>> I NEVER EXPECTED THAT THIS

09:30.536 --> 09:31.871
CASE WOULD GO THE WAY THAT IT

09:31.938 --> 09:37.243
DID, THAT I WOULD END UP CHARGED

09:37.310 --> 09:38.444
MUCH LESS CONVICTED AND BE HERE

09:38.511 --> 09:39.712
FOR THE LAST 20 SOME YEARS

09:39.779 --> 09:43.649
TRYING TO PROVE I DIDN'T DO IT.

09:43.716 --> 09:44.450
>> John: OKAY, A LOT TO UNPACK

09:44.517 --> 09:44.650
THERE.

09:44.717 --> 09:45.318
FROM THE FACT THAT LETTER DIDN'T

09:45.384 --> 09:45.952
SAY IT WAS "MESSED UP," IT SAID

09:46.018 --> 09:46.385
IT WAS "FUCKED UP."

09:46.452 --> 09:46.986
TO THE FACT IT OPENED WITH

09:47.053 --> 09:47.586
"WHAT'S UP, DUDE."

09:47.653 --> 09:48.220
WHICH IS A WEIRD WAY TO GREET A

09:48.287 --> 09:49.622
PERSON WHO'S IN PRISON FOR

09:49.689 --> 09:50.022
SOMETHING YOU DID.

09:50.089 --> 09:51.924
HOW'D HE EXPECT JOHNSON TO

09:51.991 --> 09:53.960
RESPOND: "OH, NOT MUCH, YOU?"

09:54.026 --> 09:55.695
BUT IT'S NOT JUST THAT LETTER --

09:55.761 --> 10:07.073
BOTH THE REAL KILLERS HAVE NOW

10:07.139 --> 10:09.475
SIGNED MULTIPLE AFFIDAVITS.

10:09.542 --> 10:10.343
THAT'S AN AUTOMATIC GET OF JAIL

10:10.409 --> 10:11.344
FREE CARD, UNFORTUNATELY, LIFE

10:11.410 --> 10:12.111
ISN'T A GAME OF MONOPOLY.

10:12.178 --> 10:12.778
FOR ONE THING, NO ONE THESE DAYS

10:12.845 --> 10:13.612
CAN AFFORD TO BUY PROPERTY AND

10:13.679 --> 10:14.714
TOP HATS ARE ONLY WORN BY AMY

10:14.780 --> 10:15.381
SHERMAN PALLADINO AND THE

10:15.448 --> 10:17.316
BABADOOK.

10:17.383 --> 10:18.918
SO AS OF NOW, JOHNSON IS STILL

10:18.985 --> 10:20.052
IN PRISON, AND IT'S VERY MUCH UP

10:20.119 --> 10:20.619
IN THE AIR WHETHER HE'LL GET

10:20.686 --> 10:22.755
OUT.

10:22.822 --> 10:23.389
AND IF YOU'RE WONDERING HOW THE

10:23.456 --> 10:25.057
FUCK THAT CAN BE THE CASE,

10:25.124 --> 10:27.460
THAT'S WHAT OUR STORY TONIGHT'S

10:27.526 --> 10:27.660
ABOUT.

10:27.727 --> 10:29.328
IT CONCERNS ALL THE REASONS WHY,

10:29.395 --> 10:30.262
IF YOU'RE WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

10:30.329 --> 10:31.931
-- EVEN IF THERE'S COMPELLING

10:31.998 --> 10:32.732
EVIDENCE OF YOUR INNOCENCE --

10:32.798 --> 10:33.232
IT'S REALLY HARD TO BE

10:33.299 --> 10:35.034
EXONERATED.

10:35.101 --> 10:36.602
AND LET'S START WITH THE FACT

10:36.669 --> 10:37.603
THE CONSTITUTION GUARANTEES THE

10:37.670 --> 10:38.204
WRIT OF HABEAS CORPUS WHICH IS

10:38.270 --> 10:38.771
TO PROTECT AGAINST UNLAWFUL

10:38.838 --> 10:40.573
IMPRISONMENT.

10:40.639 --> 10:41.340
BASICALLY, YOU HAVE A RIGHT TO

10:41.407 --> 10:43.242
CHALLENGE YOUR INCARCERATION.

10:43.309 --> 10:44.977
AND YOU CAN DO THAT IN BOTH

10:45.044 --> 10:46.512
STATE AND FEDERAL COURT.

10:46.579 --> 10:47.213
BUT AS THIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY

10:47.279 --> 10:48.948
EXPLAINS, THERE'S A MAJOR

10:49.015 --> 10:53.819
LIMITATION ON THAT RIGHT:

10:53.886 --> 10:56.489
>> IT'S NOT JUST ENOUGH TO BE

10:56.555 --> 10:56.756
INNOCENT.

10:56.822 --> 10:57.356
THAT DOESN'T GET YOU ANYWHERE.

10:57.423 --> 10:59.892
YOU HAVE TO HAVE SOMETHING ELSE

10:59.959 --> 11:03.162
TO BE ABLE TO GET BACK ON.

11:03.229 --> 11:04.096
>> John: YEAH, IT'S TRUE.

11:04.163 --> 11:04.797
IN GENERAL, INNOCENCE ITSELF IS

11:04.864 --> 11:06.132
NOT AN APPEALABLE ISSUE.

11:06.198 --> 11:07.233
SO SHOCKING, IT MIGHT

11:07.299 --> 11:11.971
PROMPT YOU TO GO NOW, WHAT YOU

11:12.038 --> 11:13.773
-- SHE WAS IN THE BACKGROUND OF

11:13.839 --> 11:15.474
THAT SCENE GIVING AT THAT KIND

11:15.541 --> 11:16.042
OF COMMITMENT.

11:16.108 --> 11:17.743
WHAT YOU CAN APPEAL ON THIS IN A

11:17.810 --> 11:19.078
SHOCKING NEW EVIDENCE THAT

11:19.145 --> 11:20.413
WASN'T AVAILABLE DURING YOUR

11:20.479 --> 11:21.747
ORIGINAL TRIAL OR CLAIM THEIR

11:21.814 --> 11:24.183
CONSTITUTIONAL RIGHTS WERE

11:24.250 --> 11:26.285
VIOLATED.

11:26.352 --> 11:27.386
AND THAT'S ALREADY A LONG SHOT.

11:27.453 --> 11:28.087
ESPECIALLY BECAUSE WHILE YOU

11:28.154 --> 11:28.754
HAVE THE RIGHT TO AN ATTORNEY AT

11:28.821 --> 11:29.388
YOUR ORIGINAL TRIAL, YOU'RE NOT

11:29.455 --> 11:29.922
GUARANTEED ONE AFTER YOUR

11:29.989 --> 11:30.589
CONVICTION.

11:30.656 --> 11:31.223
MOST STATES DO PROVIDE ONE IN

11:31.290 --> 11:31.857
DEATH PENALTY CASES, BUT EVEN

11:31.924 --> 11:33.426
THEN, THERE'S NO GUARANTEE THEY

11:33.492 --> 11:34.693
BE COMPETENT.

11:34.760 --> 11:35.828
AND ATTORNEYS CAN BE

11:35.895 --> 11:36.962
INCOMPETENT.

11:37.029 --> 11:38.097
TAKE GEDDES ANDERSON.

11:38.164 --> 11:39.665
HE REPRESENTED A MAN NAMED

11:39.732 --> 11:41.367
EDWARD LEE ELMORE IN A MURDER

11:41.434 --> 11:43.102
CASE AND LOST IT.

11:43.169 --> 11:44.303
ELMORE WAS SENTENCED TO DEATH,

11:44.370 --> 11:45.037
AND WHILE ON DEATH ROW, APPEALED

11:45.104 --> 11:45.905
HIS CONVICTION.

11:45.971 --> 11:47.339
HE PETITIONED FOR A DIFFERENT

11:47.406 --> 11:48.841
LAWYER, BUT WAS TOLD HE HAD TO

11:48.908 --> 11:49.508
STICK WITH ANDERSON, WHO'D ONLY

11:49.575 --> 11:52.011
SPENT EIGHT DAYS PREPARING FOR

11:52.078 --> 11:53.813
HIS TRIAL AND WHO CAN ONLY BE

11:53.879 --> 11:54.947
DESCRIBED AS THE MOST TENNESSEE

11:55.014 --> 11:59.552
WILLIAMS OF CHARACTERS.

11:59.618 --> 12:02.188
>> IN RETROSPECT, PERHAPS I

12:02.254 --> 12:06.292
SHOULD HAVE ASKED FOR MORE TIME.

12:06.358 --> 12:08.294
I NEVER PROCLAIMED TO BE THE

12:08.360 --> 12:09.261
BEST LAWYER THAT EVER GRACED THE

12:09.328 --> 12:14.867
COURTROOM.

12:14.934 --> 12:16.268
>> John: WELL, THAT'S NOT GREAT.

12:16.335 --> 12:16.902
THE ONLY THING WORSE THAN BEING

12:16.969 --> 12:17.470
A BAD LAWYER IS BEING A BAD

12:17.536 --> 12:18.237
LAWYER WITH LOW SELF-ESTEEM.

12:18.304 --> 12:18.938
IN THE WORDS OF RUPAUL, IF YOU

12:19.004 --> 12:19.572
CAN'T DEFEND YOURSELF, HOW IN

12:19.638 --> 12:20.940
THE HELL ARE YOU GOING TO DEFEND

12:21.006 --> 12:24.243
SOMEBODY ELSE?

12:24.310 --> 12:26.178
YOU DO NEED AN EXCEPTIONALLY

12:26.245 --> 12:28.180
GOOD ATTORNEY FOR AN APPEAL.

12:28.247 --> 12:29.548
POSTCONVICTION LAWS AND

12:29.615 --> 12:30.049
CURRENTLY DIFFICULT TO

12:30.116 --> 12:30.916
UNDERSTAND EVEN FOR A SEASONED

12:30.983 --> 12:32.685
ATTORNEY AND YOU WANT TO GET IT

12:32.751 --> 12:33.719
RIGHT BECAUSE ANY TECHNICAL

12:33.786 --> 12:34.420
ERROR COULD RESULT IN YOUR

12:34.487 --> 12:38.457
APPEAL BEING DISMISSED.

12:38.524 --> 12:39.225
SO MANY WRONGFUL CONVICTION

12:39.291 --> 12:40.159
CASES ARE WON OR LOST ON

12:40.226 --> 12:40.793
TECHNICALITIES.

12:40.860 --> 12:41.327
EVEN ONES THAT ARE PRETTY

12:41.393 --> 12:41.994
COMPELLING!

12:42.061 --> 12:42.695
TAKE RICKY KIDD, A MAN

12:42.761 --> 12:43.996
WRONGFULLY CONVICTED OF MURDER

12:44.063 --> 12:45.097
IN 1997 DESPITE THE FACT THAT

12:45.164 --> 12:45.731
NO PHYSICAL EVIDENCE LINKED HIM

12:45.798 --> 12:46.765
TO THE MURDERS.

12:46.832 --> 12:48.067
THE CASE AGAINST HIM WAS

12:48.134 --> 12:49.401
LITTERED WITH POLICE

12:49.468 --> 12:50.002
INCOMPETENCE AND PROSECUTORIAL

12:50.069 --> 12:51.170
MISCONDUCT.

12:51.237 --> 12:53.172
AND HIS OWN LAWYER FAILED TO

12:53.239 --> 12:54.073
CHASE DOWN EXONERATING EVIDENCE,

12:54.140 --> 12:55.708
SUCH AS THE FACT THAT, AROUND

12:55.774 --> 12:56.809
THE TIME THE MURDER TOOK PLACE,

12:56.876 --> 12:57.843
KIDD WAS IN A SHERIFF'S OFFICE,

12:57.910 --> 12:59.645
APPLYING FOR A GUN PERMIT.

12:59.712 --> 13:02.915
WHICH IS A PRETTY SOLID ALIBI.

13:02.982 --> 13:04.583
KIDD'S BEST GROUNDS TO APPEAL

13:04.650 --> 13:05.351
WERE THAT HE HAD INEFFECTIVE

13:05.417 --> 13:07.153
COUNSEL AT HIS FIRST TRIAL.

13:07.219 --> 13:08.621
BUT UNFORTUNATELY, WHEN HIS NEW

13:08.687 --> 13:10.422
LAWYERS FILED THAT APPEAL, THEY

13:10.489 --> 13:12.625
FAILED TO INCLUDE THAT ARGUMENT.

13:12.691 --> 13:13.259
SO THE STATE FOUGHT TO KEEP HIM

13:13.325 --> 13:14.426
LOCKED UP.

13:14.493 --> 13:15.694
WHICH IS BOTH OUTRAGEOUS, AND

13:15.761 --> 13:18.030
SOMETHING THE ASSISTANT STATE

13:18.097 --> 13:19.131
A.G. WAS COMICALLY UNWILLING TO

13:19.198 --> 13:22.968
DISCUSS.

13:23.035 --> 13:24.937
>> DON'T HAVE ANY CONCERN THAT A

13:25.004 --> 13:26.405
POLICE COMMISSIONER AND FORMER

13:26.472 --> 13:29.975
PROSECUTOR SAY HE'S INNOCENT?

13:30.042 --> 13:32.811
>> YOUR NAME IS HERE IN THE

13:32.878 --> 13:33.579
COURT DOCUMENT.

13:33.646 --> 13:35.848
WE ARE NOT EVEN ARGUING THAT

13:35.915 --> 13:36.448
HE'S GUILTY.

13:36.515 --> 13:38.050
JUST TECHNICALITIES THAT HE

13:38.117 --> 13:38.851
MISSED HIS CHANCE TO PROPERLY

13:38.918 --> 13:43.322
APPEAL.

13:43.389 --> 13:44.023
YOU DON'T SEEM CONCERNED ABOUT

13:44.089 --> 13:44.924
THIS.

13:44.990 --> 13:49.895
DO YOU EVEN THINK HE'S GUILTY?

13:49.962 --> 13:50.629
NO ANSWER?

13:50.696 --> 13:52.331
YOU'RE SPENDING TAXPAYER MONEY

13:52.398 --> 13:53.766
TO FIGHT THIS CASE.

13:53.832 --> 13:55.467
YOU'RE KEEPING HIM LOCKED UP IN

13:55.534 --> 13:55.734
PRISON.

13:55.801 --> 13:58.170
IS THAT THE BEST USE OF TAXPAYER

13:58.237 --> 13:58.571
MONEY?

13:58.637 --> 14:02.975
>> Y'ALL HAVE A GOOD DAY, SIR.

14:03.042 --> 14:03.842
>> John: WOW.

14:03.909 --> 14:04.610
I'M CONFLICTED THERE.

14:04.677 --> 14:05.110
OBVIOUSLY THAT MAN IS

14:05.177 --> 14:05.578
A HEARTLESS MONSTER,

14:05.644 --> 14:06.212
SMIRKING LIKE A WAX STATUE OF

14:06.278 --> 14:07.213
PAUL GIAMATTI WHEN A MAN'S LIFE

14:07.279 --> 14:07.546
IS AT STAKE.

14:07.613 --> 14:08.214
BUT I DO RESPECT HIS ICE COLD

14:08.280 --> 14:09.949
ATTEMPT AT IGNORING SMALL TALK

14:10.015 --> 14:10.983
IN AN ELEVATOR.

14:11.050 --> 14:12.051
ELEVATORS ARE FLYING COFFINS

14:12.117 --> 14:13.118
THAT DEMAND TOTAL SILENCE FROM

14:13.185 --> 14:16.822
EACH OF THEIR PALLBEARERS.

14:16.889 --> 14:18.057
WE HAVE TO REACH AGREEMENT.

14:18.123 --> 14:19.091
AND WHILE IT'S NOT IMPORTANT,

14:19.158 --> 14:19.625
QUICK SHOUT-OUT TO THE GUY

14:19.692 --> 14:20.826
WAVING AT THE CAMERA IN THE

14:20.893 --> 14:21.427
BACKGROUND THERE.

14:21.493 --> 14:23.062
HEY, BUDDY!

14:23.128 --> 14:24.263
HEY, BET YOU HAD NO IDEA AT THE

14:24.330 --> 14:25.297
TIME THAT YOUR WAVE WAS

14:25.364 --> 14:26.865
UNDERSCORING A GROTESQUE FAILURE

14:26.932 --> 14:27.600
OF OUR ENTIRE JUDICIAL SYSTEM!

14:27.666 --> 14:28.400
BUT IT WAS!

14:28.467 --> 14:29.301
IT WAS!

14:29.368 --> 14:31.437
BYE!

14:31.503 --> 14:33.072
BUT THAT ACTUALLY BRINGS US TO A

14:33.138 --> 14:34.173
KEY POINT HERE, WHICH IS, WHEN

14:34.240 --> 14:35.307
THE WHOLE CRIMINAL JUSTICE

14:35.374 --> 14:36.475
SYSTEM IS GEARED TOWARD GETTING

14:36.542 --> 14:37.276
A CONVICTION, IT HAS LITTLE

14:37.343 --> 14:39.278
INTEREST IN SEEING ITS WORK

14:39.345 --> 14:41.013
UNDONE.

14:41.080 --> 14:42.181
SO, FOR INSTANCE, I MENTIONED

14:42.248 --> 14:43.515
EARLIER THAT ONE OF THE FEW WAYS

14:43.582 --> 14:44.817
TO GET A POST-CONVICTION APPEAL

14:44.883 --> 14:45.751
IS TO ARGUE THAT YOU HAVE NEW

14:45.818 --> 14:46.986
EVIDENCE TO INTRODUCE.

14:47.052 --> 14:48.554
BUT YOU STILL HAVE TO BE ABLE TO

14:48.621 --> 14:49.822
SHOW THAT IT WOULD HAVE CHANGED

14:49.888 --> 14:51.457
THE OUTCOME AT YOUR TRIAL.

14:51.523 --> 14:52.191
AND PROSECUTORS WILL FIGHT THAT

14:52.258 --> 14:54.393
NOTION HARD.

14:54.460 --> 14:56.195
WHEN ONE OF THE WEST MEMPHIS

14:56.262 --> 14:58.864
THREE TRIED TO GET A NEW TRIAL,

14:58.931 --> 15:01.333
BASED ON NEW EVIDENCE,

15:01.400 --> 15:02.301
INCLUDING DNA, AN ASSISTANT

15:02.368 --> 15:03.802
A.G. APPEARED BEFORE THE STATE'S

15:03.869 --> 15:04.570
SUPREME COURT TO TRY AND TALK

15:04.637 --> 15:05.137
THEM OUT OF CONSIDERING IT,

15:05.204 --> 15:11.210
CITING THE HARM THAT COULD DO.

15:11.277 --> 15:13.746
>> WHAT HARM IS THERE ALLOWING

15:13.812 --> 15:14.813
HIM TO PRESENT ALL EVIDENCE?

15:14.880 --> 15:17.750
>> THE HARM IS IN THE FINALITY

15:17.816 --> 15:20.352
OF THE CRIMINAL JUDGMENT NOT

15:20.419 --> 15:21.587
DEMONSTRATED TO HAVE ANY

15:21.654 --> 15:22.221
CONSTITUTIONAL OR PROCEDURAL

15:22.288 --> 15:25.424
DEFENSE AND JUST TRY IT AGAIN.

15:25.491 --> 15:27.493
YOU'RE SUGGESTING.

15:27.559 --> 15:28.927
AS THOUGH EVERY 15 OR 17 YEARS

15:28.994 --> 15:32.097
OR SO WE OUGHT TO TRY CASES

15:32.164 --> 15:32.665
AGAIN TO REESTABLISH GUILT.

15:32.731 --> 15:37.569
THE HARM IS TO THE CRIMINAL

15:37.636 --> 15:39.538
JUSTICE SYSTEMS INTEREST IN

15:39.605 --> 15:41.340
FINALITY.

15:41.407 --> 15:41.974
>> John: HOLD ON.

15:42.041 --> 15:42.908
THE HARM IS TO THE

15:42.975 --> 15:43.575
"FINALITY?"

15:43.642 --> 15:44.476
BUT IF THE FINAL DECISION COULD

15:44.543 --> 15:45.244
BE WRONG, YOU SHOULD WANT TO

15:45.311 --> 15:45.811
MAKE SURE YOU GOT IT RIGHT.

15:45.878 --> 15:46.578
THERE'S A REASON LA LA LAND

15:46.645 --> 15:47.980
DIDN'T JUST KEEP THE OSCAR AFTER

15:48.047 --> 15:48.814
FAYE DUNAWAY AND WARREN BEATTY

15:48.881 --> 15:49.782
SKIN SMILED THEIR WAY THROUGH

15:49.848 --> 15:50.582
THAT MISTAKE.

15:50.649 --> 15:55.754
BUT WHILE, THANKFULLY, THOSE

15:55.821 --> 15:57.222
JUDGES WERE SKEPTICAL --

15:57.289 --> 15:58.023
MANY DEFER TO PROSECUTORS.

15:58.090 --> 15:58.991
THAT WAS THE CASE WITH EDWARD

15:59.058 --> 15:59.758
LEE ELMORE, THE GUY WHOSE

15:59.825 --> 16:00.392
INITIAL LAWYER WAS INSECURE

16:00.459 --> 16:01.226
FOGHORN LEGHORN.

16:01.293 --> 16:02.795
THE KEY EVIDENCE AGAINST HIM

16:02.861 --> 16:04.029
WERE HAIRS AT A MURDER SCENE

16:04.096 --> 16:04.897
THAT POLICE CLAIMED WERE OF

16:04.963 --> 16:05.898
AFRICAN AMERICAN DESCENT.

16:05.964 --> 16:07.066
BUT THERE WERE NO PHOTOS OF

16:07.132 --> 16:08.834
THOSE HAIRS AT THE SCENE --

16:08.901 --> 16:10.269
WHICH IS ALREADY SUSPICIOUS, AND

16:10.336 --> 16:11.937
THE STATE LATER FOUND A BOX OF

16:12.004 --> 16:13.138
EVIDENCE, PREVIOUSLY CLAIMED TO

16:13.205 --> 16:15.841
BE MISSING BY POLICE, THAT

16:15.908 --> 16:16.342
CONTAINED CAUCASIAN HAIR

16:16.408 --> 16:17.776
RECOVERED FROM THE VICTIM'S BODY

16:17.843 --> 16:18.944
DURING HER AUTOPSY.

16:19.011 --> 16:20.512
BUT WHEN THE JUDGE WAS PRESENTED

16:20.579 --> 16:21.780
WITH THIS PRETTY IMPORTANT NEW

16:21.847 --> 16:22.648
INFORMATION, HE SIMPLY WASN'T

16:22.715 --> 16:28.787
INTERESTED.

16:28.854 --> 16:29.355
>> THIS IS A COMPLETELY

16:29.421 --> 16:31.190
DIFFERENT CASE THAN WHAT THE

16:31.256 --> 16:31.924
JURY HEARD.

16:31.990 --> 16:33.392
THIS IS NOT ENOUGH TO GRANT

16:33.459 --> 16:36.228
SOMEBODY A NEW TRIAL.

16:36.295 --> 16:40.532
>> UNEXPECTEDLY RATHER THAN

16:40.599 --> 16:41.300
ADJOURN AND READ THE FILINGS

16:41.367 --> 16:43.068
BEFORE RULING, THE JUDGE ISSUED

16:43.135 --> 16:45.604
HIS DECISION ON THE SPOT.

16:45.671 --> 16:51.777
>> ALL MOTIONS ARE DENIED.

16:51.844 --> 16:52.578
>> John: OH, IT GETS WORSE.

16:52.644 --> 16:53.212
THAT JUDGE WENT ON TO SAY THAT,

16:53.278 --> 16:54.513
OBVIOUSLY, THE EVIDENCE SHOULD

16:54.580 --> 16:55.147
HAVE BEEN DISCLOSED TO COUNSEL,

16:55.214 --> 16:55.714
BUT AS FAR AS IMPACTING THE

16:55.781 --> 16:56.348
ORIGINAL VERDICT, I DON'T THINK

16:56.415 --> 16:56.949
IT WOULD HAVE, AND IN CLOSING,

16:57.015 --> 16:57.416
HE SAID, "GOOD LUCK TO

16:57.483 --> 16:58.016
EVERYBODY, I'M OUT OF HERE."

16:58.083 --> 16:58.650
WHICH IS A TERRIBLE WAY TO WRAP

16:58.717 --> 17:00.085
UP A COURT PROCEEDING.

17:00.152 --> 17:07.493
THE BEST, OF COURSE, BEING THIS:

17:07.559 --> 17:08.994
>> THAT'S MY VERDICT AND THAT'S

17:09.061 --> 17:12.064
HOW I SEE IT.

17:12.131 --> 17:13.198
>> John: UNIMPEACHABLE.

17:13.265 --> 17:14.233
BUT THE THING IS, A QUICK RULING

17:14.299 --> 17:15.367
LIKE THAT ISN'T UNUSUAL.

17:15.434 --> 17:16.502
MANY TIMES, APPEALS JUDGES WILL

17:16.568 --> 17:17.136
JUST SIGN THE STATE PROSECUTOR'S

17:17.202 --> 17:18.504
DOCUMENTS WITHOUT EVEN CHANGING

17:18.570 --> 17:20.439
THE HEADING.

17:20.506 --> 17:21.173
ONE STUDY LOOKED AT

17:21.240 --> 17:21.774
POST-CONVICTION APPEALS IN THE

17:21.840 --> 17:22.341
LARGEST COUNTY IN TEXAS AND

17:22.408 --> 17:24.943
FOUND JUDGES ADOPTED THE

17:25.010 --> 17:25.711
PROSECUTORS FINDINGS VERBATIM IN

17:25.778 --> 17:29.014
96% OF THEIR RULINGS.

17:29.081 --> 17:30.816
AND IF, AT THIS POINT, IT SEEMS

17:30.883 --> 17:32.050
LIKE OUR WHOLE SYSTEM IS SET UP

17:32.117 --> 17:33.051
TO PRESERVE ITS PROCESS -- EVEN

17:33.118 --> 17:34.486
AT THE COST OF HUMAN LIFE --

17:34.553 --> 17:36.388
WELL, DURING ONE DEATH ROW

17:36.455 --> 17:38.190
APPEAL BEFORE THE MISSOURI

17:38.257 --> 17:41.593
SUPREME COURT, FOR THIS MAN, JOE

17:41.660 --> 17:42.294
AMRINE, ONE ASSISTANT A.G.

17:42.361 --> 17:46.432
BASICALLY ADMITTED AS MUCH.

17:46.498 --> 17:50.335
>> YOU ARE SUGGESTING IF WE

17:50.402 --> 17:51.537
DON'T FIND THERE'S A

17:51.603 --> 17:52.137
CONSTITUTIONAL VIOLATION THEN

17:52.204 --> 17:54.773
EVEN IF WE FIND THAT HE IS

17:54.840 --> 17:56.708
INNOCENT, THAT HE SHOULD BE

17:56.775 --> 17:57.342
EXECUTED?

17:57.409 --> 17:58.710
>> THE U.S. SUPREME COURT.

17:58.777 --> 18:02.748
>> IS THAT WHAT YOU ARE ARGUING?

18:02.815 --> 18:03.549
>> John: HOLY SHIT.

18:03.615 --> 18:04.283
YOU KNOW YOU'RE ON THE WRONG

18:04.349 --> 18:04.983
SIDE OF AN ARGUMENT WHEN YOU'RE

18:05.050 --> 18:05.617
ASKED, "SHOULD INNOCENT PEOPLE

18:05.684 --> 18:06.485
BE EXECUTED?"

18:06.552 --> 18:07.386
AND YOU SAY, "THAT'S CORRECT,

18:07.453 --> 18:08.687
YOUR HONOR."

18:08.754 --> 18:10.522
THAT'S THE KIND OF QUESTION THAT

18:10.589 --> 18:11.757
HAS ONLY ONE RIGHT ANSWER, LIKE

18:11.824 --> 18:12.691
"IS THE QUEEN DEAD?"

18:12.758 --> 18:14.726
THE OBVIOUS ANSWER TO THAT

18:14.793 --> 18:16.795
BEING, YES, SHE'S BEEN DEAD

18:16.862 --> 18:17.129
SINCE 2007.

18:17.196 --> 18:21.133
AND IT'S A GOOD THING.

18:21.200 --> 18:21.834
IT'S A GOOD THING.

18:21.900 --> 18:25.204
IT'S A GOOD THING.

18:25.270 --> 18:26.438
ORDER IN THE COURT.

18:26.505 --> 18:27.172
AND SO FAR, EVERYTHING WE'VE

18:27.239 --> 18:27.806
DISCUSSED HAS BEEN AT THE STATE

18:27.873 --> 18:28.207
LEVEL.

18:28.273 --> 18:29.107
BUT WHAT ABOUT IF YOU APPEAL UP

18:29.174 --> 18:30.108
TO FEDERAL COURT?

18:30.175 --> 18:32.611
WELL, IN SOME CASES, THEY DO

18:32.678 --> 18:33.212
STEP IN TO OVERTURN EGREGIOUS

18:33.278 --> 18:34.112
CONVICTIONS.

18:34.179 --> 18:35.347
BUT AS THIS DEFENSE ATTORNEY

18:35.414 --> 18:35.981
WILL TELL YOU, THAT IS VERY MUCH

18:36.048 --> 18:40.953
THE EXCEPTION.

18:41.019 --> 18:42.621
>> WE ALL UNDERSTAND THAT THE

18:42.688 --> 18:44.356
ROLE OF AN APPEALS COURT IS TO

18:44.423 --> 18:45.958
GET IT RIGHT AND IF IT GETS IT

18:46.024 --> 18:48.327
WRONG, THAT IT WILL BE FIXED

18:48.393 --> 18:49.394
DOWN THE ROAD IN THE SYSTEM.

18:49.461 --> 18:50.662
THAT'S THE BELIEF WE ALL HAVE IN

18:50.729 --> 18:52.164
THE SYSTEM.

18:52.231 --> 18:54.266
IF SOME COURT TO GETS IT WRONG,

18:54.333 --> 18:55.200
ANOTHER COURT IS GOING TO COME

18:55.267 --> 18:58.203
ALONG AND SET IT RIGHT.

18:58.270 --> 18:59.738
FEDERAL COURTS CAN ONLY GRANT

18:59.805 --> 19:01.640
RELIEF OF THE STATE COURT WAS

19:01.707 --> 19:02.941
UNREASONABLY WRONG, SO WRONG

19:03.008 --> 19:04.877
THAT NO OTHER JUDGE, NO OTHER

19:04.943 --> 19:06.879
FAIR-MINDED JUDGE COULD POSSIBLY

19:06.945 --> 19:08.647
AGREE.

19:08.714 --> 19:12.851
THAT IS AN INCREDIBLY HIGH BAR.

19:12.918 --> 19:13.418
>> John: YEAH, IT REALLY IS.

19:13.485 --> 19:14.019
BECAUSE "NO FAIR-MINDED JUDGE

19:14.086 --> 19:15.053
COULD POSSIBLY AGREE" IS A HIGH

19:15.120 --> 19:15.521
BAR TO CLEAR.

19:15.587 --> 19:16.788
REASONABLE PEOPLE DISAGREE ALL

19:16.855 --> 19:18.090
THE TIME, ON ISSUES LIKE WHICH

19:18.156 --> 19:19.791
WAY THE TOILET PAPER ROLL SHOULD

19:19.858 --> 19:20.792
GO OR HOW A TORTOISE WOULD WEAR

19:20.859 --> 19:21.093
CLOTHES.

19:21.159 --> 19:21.860
IS IT OVER THE SHELL?

19:21.927 --> 19:23.695
OR UNDER THE SHELL?

19:23.762 --> 19:24.997
THERE'S A VIBRANT DISCUSSION TO

19:25.063 --> 19:28.567
BE HAD HERE.

19:28.634 --> 19:30.135
THE TRUTH IS FEDERAL COURTS'

19:30.202 --> 19:31.737
HANDS ARE TIED PRETTY TIGHTLY,

19:31.803 --> 19:33.071
BY SOMETHING CALLED AEDPA.

19:33.138 --> 19:34.239
IT STANDS FOR THE ANTI-TERRORISM

19:34.306 --> 19:35.674
AND EFFECTIVE DEATH PENALTY ACT,

19:35.741 --> 19:37.009
IT WAS PASSED IN THE 1990S IN

19:37.075 --> 19:37.809
THE WAKE OF THE OKLAHOMA CITY

19:37.876 --> 19:40.345
BOMBING AND AT THE TIME, THE

19:40.412 --> 19:41.613
JUSTIFICATION FOR IT WAS WE

19:41.680 --> 19:42.447
CAN'T LET TERRORISTS LIKE

19:42.514 --> 19:43.348
TIMOTHY MCVEIGH, OR ANY

19:43.415 --> 19:43.982
PRISONERS ON DEATH ROW, APPEAL

19:44.049 --> 19:46.184
THEIR CASES ENDLESSLY.

19:46.251 --> 19:49.721
HERE'S THE ARGUMENT IN A

19:49.788 --> 19:51.523
NUTSHELL.

19:51.590 --> 19:53.992
>> WHAT ABOUT THE FACT THAT MANY

19:54.059 --> 19:56.128
SIT ON DEATH ROW FOR YEARS AND

19:56.194 --> 19:58.463
YEARS AND YEARS WITH ACCESS TO

19:58.530 --> 19:59.031
LIBRARIES AND COMPUTERS AND

19:59.097 --> 20:00.098
EVERYTHING THEY COULD POSSIBLY

20:00.165 --> 20:01.900
NEED SO THEY CONTINUE TO DRAG

20:01.967 --> 20:02.834
OUT THE PROCESS QUESTION LIKE

20:02.901 --> 20:07.873
THERE'S GOT TO BE IN END TO IT.

20:07.940 --> 20:08.674
>> John: OKAY, THAT'S ACTUALLY

20:08.740 --> 20:09.374
AN EVEN WORSE ARGUMENT THAN IT

20:09.441 --> 20:09.775
SEEMS.

20:09.841 --> 20:11.209
BECAUSE REMEMBER: THIS WAS 1995.

20:11.276 --> 20:11.810
THE ONLY THINGS COMPUTERS WERE

20:11.877 --> 20:12.477
GOOD FOR BACK THEN WERE

20:12.544 --> 20:13.111
MINESWEEPER AND STILL IMAGES OF

20:13.178 --> 20:14.479
CAL RIPKEN JR.

20:14.546 --> 20:15.380
I'M GUESSING THAT IN 1995, IF

20:15.447 --> 20:19.251
YOU TYPED "POSTCONVICTION HABEAS

20:19.318 --> 20:21.019
CORPUS APPEAL" INTO LYCOS.COM

20:21.086 --> 20:21.587
YOUR HARD DRIVE WOULD SPARK

20:21.653 --> 20:23.989
INTO A FULL BLOWN HOUSE FIRE.

20:24.056 --> 20:25.223
SO PRISONERS SOMETIMES HAVING

20:25.290 --> 20:25.791
ACCESS TO COMPUTERS CLEARLY

20:25.857 --> 20:26.825
WASN'T THE REAL PROBLEM HERE.

20:26.892 --> 20:27.726
AND ALTHOUGH AEDPA SOUNDS LIKE

20:27.793 --> 20:29.428
IT ONLY APPLIED TO TERRORISTS

20:29.494 --> 20:30.195
AND DEATH ROW INMATES,

20:30.262 --> 20:31.630
IT APPLIES TO EVERYONE.

20:31.697 --> 20:33.498
AND IN ADDITION TO THAT HIGH BAR

20:33.565 --> 20:36.868
THAT GUTTED FEDERAL REVIEW OF

20:36.935 --> 20:37.402
STATE CONVICTIONS, IT ALSO

20:37.469 --> 20:38.537
IMPOSED A STRICT ONE YEAR

20:38.604 --> 20:39.938
DEADLINE TO FILE A FEDERAL

20:40.005 --> 20:40.572
APPEAL ONCE YOUR CONVICTION IS

20:40.639 --> 20:41.707
FINALIZED.

20:41.773 --> 20:43.141
WHICH I KNOW MIGHT SOUND LIKE A

20:43.208 --> 20:44.810
LOT OF TIME, BUT IT REALLY

20:44.876 --> 20:45.978
ISN'T.

20:46.044 --> 20:47.946
A FEDERAL APPEAL IS A MASSIVE

20:48.013 --> 20:48.947
UNDERTAKING, OFTEN INVOLVING

20:49.014 --> 20:51.516
DOING NEW RESEARCH, SPEAKING TO

20:51.583 --> 20:52.851
EXPERTS, WITNESSES, PREVIOUS

20:52.918 --> 20:54.219
ATTORNEYS AND INVESTIGATORS,

20:54.286 --> 20:55.754
ONE YEAR CAN NOT BE ENOUGH, AS

20:55.821 --> 20:57.222
PROVEN BY THE FACT THAT,

20:57.289 --> 20:59.257
POST-AEDPA, THE DEADLINE HAD

20:59.324 --> 20:59.992
BEEN MISSED AT LEAST EIGHTY

21:00.058 --> 21:02.227
TIMES IN DEATH ROW CASES.

21:02.294 --> 21:04.062
EIGHTY TIMES, DEATH-ROW

21:04.129 --> 21:05.430
PRISONERS WENT TO THE TROUBLE OF

21:05.497 --> 21:06.398
FILING AN APPEAL, ONLY TO BE

21:06.465 --> 21:07.866
TOLD, "SORRY, TOO LATE, IT

21:07.933 --> 21:09.801
DOESN'T COUNT."

21:09.868 --> 21:10.469
AND EVEN WHEN FILINGS DO COME IN

21:10.535 --> 21:13.271
ON TIME, THAT HIGH BAR MEANS

21:13.338 --> 21:15.107
THEY'RE LESS LIKELY TO BE

21:15.173 --> 21:16.842
SUCCESSFUL TO THE POINT THAT

21:16.908 --> 21:17.442
WHILE, BEFORE AEDPA, 40% OF

21:17.509 --> 21:18.877
DEATH ROW DEFENDANTS SUCCEEDED

21:18.944 --> 21:19.978
IN GETTING THEIR VERDICT OR

21:20.045 --> 21:21.847
SENTENCE OVERTURNED IN FEDERAL

21:21.913 --> 21:23.949
COURT, A DECADE AFTER IT, THAT

21:24.016 --> 21:28.453
RATE HAD DROPPED TO 10%.

21:28.520 --> 21:29.554
AND I WILL SAY THIS.

21:29.621 --> 21:30.389
THERE WAS ONE SENATOR WHO SAW

21:30.455 --> 21:31.556
ALL OF THESE PROBLEMS WITH AEDPA

21:31.623 --> 21:33.558
PRETTY CLEARLY, AND WARNED

21:33.625 --> 21:37.829
AGAINST WHAT MIGHT HAPPEN.

21:37.896 --> 21:40.799
>> THIS JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE

21:40.866 --> 21:42.234
IN MY VIEW, MR. PRESIDENT.

21:42.300 --> 21:44.002
AS A PRACTICAL MATTER OR MATTER

21:44.069 --> 21:44.336
OF PRINCIPLE.

21:44.403 --> 21:48.173
WE SHOULD NOT IN OUR HASTE TO

21:48.240 --> 21:48.840
HURRY UP EXECUTION LUCITE TO OUR

21:48.907 --> 21:49.408
COMMITMENT TO CONSTITUTIONAL

21:49.474 --> 21:49.775
VALUES.

21:49.841 --> 21:53.512
WE SHOULD NOT ENDORSE PROPOSALS

21:53.578 --> 21:54.513
THAT INCREASE THE CHANCE THAT

21:54.579 --> 21:55.213
WERE EXECUTION IS IMMINENT THAT

21:55.280 --> 21:59.885
AN INNOCENT PERSON THE EXECUTED.

21:59.951 --> 22:00.819
WE SHOULD NOT SACRIFICE

22:00.886 --> 22:02.120
CERTAINTY IN THE NAME OF SPEED

22:02.187 --> 22:04.489
OR FAIRNESS IN THE NAME OF

22:04.556 --> 22:07.359
VENGEANCE.

22:07.426 --> 22:08.126
>> John: YEAH!

22:08.193 --> 22:09.027
PRETTY GOOD.

22:09.094 --> 22:09.695
I KNOW IT'S WEIRD TO SEE JOE

22:09.761 --> 22:10.696
BIDEN ACTUALLY ON THE RIGHT SIDE

22:10.762 --> 22:11.430
OF A CRIMINAL JUSTICE ISSUE IN

22:11.496 --> 22:12.731
THE NINETIES, IT'S LIKE WATCHING

22:12.798 --> 22:13.298
HOME MOVIES AND SEEING YOUR

22:13.365 --> 22:16.068
BITTERLY DIVORCED PARENTS

22:16.134 --> 22:17.102
PASSIONATELY FRENCHING EACH

22:17.169 --> 22:17.803
OTHER.

22:17.869 --> 22:18.370
IT'S JUST HARD TO IMAGINE A

22:18.437 --> 22:19.838
WORLD WHERE THAT EVER HAPPENED.

22:19.905 --> 22:20.572
SO ENJOY THAT FOR JUST A MOMENT.

22:20.639 --> 22:23.542
ARE YOU ENJOYING IT?

22:23.608 --> 22:25.043
I REALLY HOPE YOU ARE.

22:25.110 --> 22:25.644
BECAUSE NOW I SHOULD TELL YOU

22:25.711 --> 22:26.244
THAT BIDEN ACTUALLY VOTED FOR

22:26.311 --> 22:29.648
THE BILL IN THE END.

22:29.715 --> 22:30.615
YOU DON'T GET TO BE SURPRISED.

22:30.682 --> 22:31.783
THE GUY IS WHO HE IS.

22:31.850 --> 22:33.185
AND THAT BRINGS US TO TODAY.

22:33.251 --> 22:34.753
WHERE MANY WRONGFULLY CONVICTED

22:34.820 --> 22:36.788
PEOPLE ARE STILL LOCKED UP, WITH

22:36.855 --> 22:37.422
A RACIALLY DISPROPORTIONATE

22:37.489 --> 22:38.356
IMPACT.

22:38.423 --> 22:39.024
INNOCENT BLACK PEOPLE

22:39.091 --> 22:40.125
ARE ABOUT SEVEN TIMES MORE

22:40.192 --> 22:41.026
LIKELY TO BE CONVICTED OF MURDER

22:41.093 --> 22:42.828
THAN INNOCENT WHITE PEOPLE.

22:42.894 --> 22:44.329
AND AT THE SAME TIME, THOSE WHO

22:44.396 --> 22:45.864
ACTUALLY COMMITTED THE CRIMES

22:45.931 --> 22:48.233
ARE STILL AT LARGE, AS THE

22:48.300 --> 22:52.571
PHILLY D.A. POINTS OUT.

22:52.637 --> 22:53.805
>> JUSTICE MEANS THAT YOU TRY TO

22:53.872 --> 22:56.074
DO THINGS THAT ARE PROPORTIONAL

22:56.141 --> 22:57.576
AND YOU TRY TO DO THINGS THAT

22:57.642 --> 22:57.909
ARE ACCURATE.

22:57.976 --> 22:59.177
TRYING TO DO THINGS THAT ARE

22:59.244 --> 23:00.812
ACCURATE, THAT MEANS YOU DO NOT

23:00.879 --> 23:02.714
WANT THE GUILTY PERSON WHO GOT

23:02.781 --> 23:03.749
AWAY TO CONTINUE TO GET AWAY AND

23:03.815 --> 23:05.450
YOU ALSO DON'T WANT THE INNOCENT

23:05.517 --> 23:07.419
PERSON TO STAY IN JAIL.

23:07.486 --> 23:11.123
THAT AIN'T RIGHT.

23:11.189 --> 23:14.893
I MEAN.

23:14.960 --> 23:17.763
DUH.

23:17.829 --> 23:19.164
>> John: YEAH, HE'S RIGHT.

23:19.231 --> 23:19.831
FUCKING DUH!

23:19.898 --> 23:20.632
YOU'VE PROBABLY ALREADY BEEN

23:20.699 --> 23:21.266
SCREAMING IT AT YOUR TV FOR THE

23:21.333 --> 23:22.033
LAST 15 MINUTES, ALONG WITH

23:22.100 --> 23:22.534
"TALK SLOWER!"

23:22.601 --> 23:23.902
AND "THIS GUY'S A FURRY, RIGHT?"

23:23.969 --> 23:24.336
THAT'S MY BUSINESS.

23:24.402 --> 23:25.003
BUT I WILL SAY, THE CLUES ARE

23:25.070 --> 23:25.270
ALL THERE.

23:25.337 --> 23:25.737
BUT AGAIN: HE'S RIGHT.

23:25.804 --> 23:26.505
WE KNOW PROSECUTORS ARE

23:26.571 --> 23:27.539
FALLIBLE, EVEN WHEN THE STAKES

23:27.606 --> 23:27.973
ARE INCREDIBLY HIGH.

23:28.039 --> 23:29.708
AND IF YOU WANT TO SEE THIS

23:29.775 --> 23:30.742
WHOLE MADDENING SYSTEM IN ONE

23:30.809 --> 23:32.144
STORY, CONSIDER THE CASE OF

23:32.210 --> 23:33.712
MELISSA LUCIO.

23:33.779 --> 23:35.046
SHE WENT THROUGH THE MOST

23:35.113 --> 23:36.214
HORRIFIC THING IMAGINABLE --

23:36.281 --> 23:37.349
THE DEATH OF HER TWO-YEAR-OLD

23:37.415 --> 23:38.717
DAUGHTER AFTER A FALL DOWN

23:38.784 --> 23:40.252
A FLIGHT OF STAIRS.

23:40.318 --> 23:41.086
BUT THE POLICE SUSPECTED FOUL

23:41.153 --> 23:43.255
PLAY, AND OVER THE COURSE OF A

23:43.321 --> 23:43.889
MARATHON INTERROGATION THE NIGHT

23:43.955 --> 23:46.758
OF HER DAUGHTER'S DEATH, LASTING

23:46.825 --> 23:47.826
UNTIL 3:00 IN THE MORNING, THEY

23:47.893 --> 23:52.764
PUSHED HER TO CONFESS TO MURDER.

23:52.831 --> 23:53.832
>> BASICALLY WHAT THEY WERE

23:53.899 --> 23:58.403
DOING AND IS THEY WERE TRYING TO

23:58.470 --> 24:00.839
MAKE ME ADMIT THAT I WAS THE ONE

24:00.906 --> 24:02.774
RESPONSIBLE FOR HER FALL.

24:02.841 --> 24:06.444
AND I KEPT TELLING THEM THAT I

24:06.511 --> 24:09.014
HADN'T HURT MY DAUGHTER.

24:09.080 --> 24:12.818
THEY WERE VERY VULGAR.

24:12.884 --> 24:15.220
VERY ROUGH.

24:15.287 --> 24:16.822
VERY PERSISTENT.

24:16.888 --> 24:19.558
>> THIS IS YOUR CHANCE TO SET IT

24:19.624 --> 24:20.025
STRAIGHT.

24:20.091 --> 24:21.493
RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE YOU'RE A

24:21.560 --> 24:23.195
COLD-BLOODED KILLER.

24:23.261 --> 24:27.499
ARE YOU A COLD-BLOODED KILLER OR

24:27.566 --> 24:29.501
FRUSTRATED MOTHER?

24:29.568 --> 24:30.702
WE KNOW SOMEBODY DID IT.

24:30.769 --> 24:32.904
WE ARE TRYING TO FIND OUT WHO

24:32.971 --> 24:33.705
DID IT.

24:33.772 --> 24:36.274
>> IT HAPPENS.

24:36.341 --> 24:36.775
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

24:36.842 --> 24:38.510
WE ALL MAKE MISTAKES.

24:38.577 --> 24:41.213
WE ALL GET UPSET.

24:41.279 --> 24:42.280
YOU ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

24:42.347 --> 24:46.618
WE ALREADY KNOW WHAT HAPPENED.

24:46.685 --> 24:47.719
>> John: I KNOW THAT'S UPSETTING

24:47.786 --> 24:48.787
TO WATCH, BUT IT'S IMPORTANT TO

24:48.854 --> 24:49.354
SEE JUST HOW AGGRESSIVE AND

24:49.421 --> 24:49.988
MANIPULATIVE THE SYSTEM CAN BE

24:50.055 --> 24:50.589
IN SOMEONE'S MOST VULNERABLE

24:50.655 --> 24:51.223
MOMENTS THAT LEAD TO THINGS LIKE

24:51.289 --> 24:52.290
FALSE CONFESSIONS.

24:52.357 --> 24:53.325
BECAUSE AFTER ALL THAT, SHE TOLD

24:53.391 --> 24:55.827
THOSE OFFICERS WHAT THEY WANTED

24:55.894 --> 24:57.062
TO HEAR, THAT SHE HAD, "IN THE

24:57.128 --> 24:58.763
PAST," SPANKED HER DAUGHTER.

24:58.830 --> 24:59.998
THE STATE ARGUED TO THE JURY

25:00.065 --> 25:00.599
THAT THAT COUNTED AS A MURDER

25:00.665 --> 25:01.867
CONFESSION.

25:01.933 --> 25:02.968
AND SHE WAS CONVICTED IN A TRIAL

25:03.034 --> 25:04.102
WHERE NOT ONLY DID THE

25:04.169 --> 25:05.170
PROSECUTION KEEP THE JURY FROM

25:05.237 --> 25:06.538
HEARING PSYCHOLOGIST'S TESTIMONY

25:06.605 --> 25:08.406
THAT COULD SPEAK TO HER MENTAL

25:08.473 --> 25:09.808
STATE AT THE TIME, BUT HER OWN

25:09.875 --> 25:11.676
DEFENSE ATTORNEY DECIDED NOT TO

25:11.743 --> 25:12.978
CALL HER OTHER CHILDREN TO THE

25:13.044 --> 25:14.012
STAND, WHO'D HAVE TESTIFIED THEY

25:14.079 --> 25:15.013
NEVER WITNESSED ANY PHYSICAL

25:15.080 --> 25:16.481
ABUSE FROM HER.

25:16.548 --> 25:18.216
AND YET, WHEN SHE TRIED TO

25:18.283 --> 25:19.451
APPEAL HER CONVICTION TO STATE

25:19.517 --> 25:21.119
COURT, THE JUDGE WAS APPARENTLY

25:21.186 --> 25:21.720
IN SUCH A HURRY, HE INITIALLY

25:21.786 --> 25:23.021
TRIED TO RULE FOR THE

25:23.088 --> 25:24.489
PROSECUTION BEFORE THE DEFENSE

25:24.556 --> 25:30.562
HAD EVEN FILED THEIR RESPONSE.

25:30.629 --> 25:31.696
ONCE IT GOT TO FEDERAL COURT, A

25:31.763 --> 25:32.998
SPLIT RULING DENIED HER APPEAL,

25:33.064 --> 25:33.999
BUT EVEN THE JUDGES WHO RULED

25:34.065 --> 25:34.666
AGAINST HER ADMITTED, "THERE WAS

25:34.733 --> 25:35.667
EXPERT TESTIMONY THAT, IF JURORS

25:35.734 --> 25:37.836
HAD ONLY HEARD IT, COULD HAVE

25:37.903 --> 25:39.671
IMPACTED THE VERDICT, GOING ON

25:39.738 --> 25:40.372
TO ACKNOWLEDGE, "WE ARE ALL,

25:40.438 --> 25:42.007
THOUGH, WORKING WITHIN THE

25:42.073 --> 25:43.475
CONSTRAINTS OF AEDPA."

25:43.541 --> 25:45.410
MELISSA LUCIO IS NOW SCHEDULED

25:45.477 --> 25:48.413
TO BE EXECUTED ON APRIL 27.

25:48.480 --> 25:50.282
NEXT MONTH.

25:50.348 --> 25:51.716
AND TO HEAR HER PROSECUTOR TELL

25:51.783 --> 25:52.617
IT, THERE'S ONLY ONE PERSON TO

25:52.684 --> 25:57.155
BLAME FOR THAT.

25:57.222 --> 26:00.692
>> SHE HAS NOBODY TO BLAME BUT

26:00.759 --> 26:00.926
HERSELF.

26:00.992 --> 26:02.494
SHE HAS NOBODY TO BLAME BUT

26:02.560 --> 26:02.794
HERSELF.

26:02.861 --> 26:04.296
PEOPLE SAY WELL, SHE SHOULDN'T

26:04.362 --> 26:04.896
BE THERE.

26:04.963 --> 26:06.698
SHE SHOULDN'T BE THERE.

26:06.765 --> 26:08.333
SHE PUT HERSELF THERE.

26:08.400 --> 26:11.102
WHO'S FAULT IS IT?

26:11.169 --> 26:12.671
WHO'S FAULT IS IT THAT SHE'S

26:12.737 --> 26:17.275
THERE IF IT'S NOT HERS?

26:17.342 --> 26:17.909
>> John: I MEAN...

26:17.976 --> 26:18.543
I CAN TAKE A CRACK AT

26:18.610 --> 26:19.544
THAT ANSWER IF YOU WANT.

26:19.611 --> 26:20.145
IT STARTS WITH "NOT HERS," AND

26:20.211 --> 26:20.779
WHILE IT ISN'T A COMPLETE LIST,

26:20.845 --> 26:21.279
IT INCLUDES THE COPS WHO

26:21.346 --> 26:22.080
BADGERED HER, THE TEXANS WHO

26:22.147 --> 26:22.747
VOTED FOR A GOVERNOR WHO SEEMS

26:22.814 --> 26:25.417
UNWILLING TO INTERVENE, TED

26:25.483 --> 26:26.151
CRUZ -- I'M ASSUMING, SOMEHOW,

26:26.217 --> 26:29.154
THE 91 SENATORS WHO VOTED FOR

26:29.220 --> 26:30.255
AEDPA IN 1996, HAMMURABI FOR

26:30.322 --> 26:31.856
CODIFYING CAPITAL PUNISHMENT IN

26:31.923 --> 26:33.725
ANCIENT BABYLON, AND YOU FOR

26:33.792 --> 26:34.192
PROSECUTING BASED ON A

26:34.259 --> 26:35.493
CONFESSION THAT WASN'T EVEN A

26:35.560 --> 26:37.896
CONFESSION, YOU FUCKING ASSHOLE.

26:37.963 --> 26:40.098
SO WITH A SYSTEM SO

26:40.165 --> 26:41.333
FUNDAMENTALLY FUCKED,

26:41.399 --> 26:43.101
WHAT DO WE DO?

26:43.168 --> 26:44.202
WELL, IMMEDIATELY WE CAN GET RID

26:44.269 --> 26:45.370
OF AEDPA.

26:45.437 --> 26:47.772
AND WE SHOULD DO THAT AS SOON AS

26:47.839 --> 26:49.941
POSSIBLE, AS THE WILL COULD BE

26:50.008 --> 26:52.010
THERE CONSIDERING HOW AGAINST IT

26:52.077 --> 26:53.111
BIDEN ONCE BRIEFLY WAS.

26:53.178 --> 26:54.379
IN ADDITION, WE SHOULD CONTINUE

26:54.446 --> 26:55.981
TO ADDRESS ALL THE MANY FACTORS

26:56.047 --> 26:57.115
THAT LEAD TO WRONGFUL

26:57.182 --> 26:58.216
CONVICTIONS IN THE FIRST PLACE.

26:58.283 --> 26:59.284
AND WHEN THEY DO HAPPEN, WE NEED

26:59.351 --> 27:01.953
TO MAKE SURE WE'VE ELECTED

27:02.020 --> 27:03.788
PROSECUTORS WHO'LL UNDERTAKE

27:03.855 --> 27:04.556
CONVICTION INTEGRITY REVIEWS,

27:04.622 --> 27:05.623
AND GOVERNORS WHO'LL USE THEIR

27:05.690 --> 27:06.257
PARDON POWER TO UNDO THE STATE'S

27:06.324 --> 27:08.560
MISTAKES.

27:08.626 --> 27:11.596
WE NEED TO MAKE THIS A PRIORITY,

27:11.663 --> 27:12.464
BECAUSE RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE A

27:12.530 --> 27:13.231
SYSTEM WHERE PEOPLE CAN BE

27:13.298 --> 27:14.432
WRONGLY CONVICTED WITH BAD

27:14.499 --> 27:15.934
DEFENSE ATTORNEYS AND LEFT TO

27:16.001 --> 27:16.701
FIGHT IN A CONVOLUTED APPEALS

27:16.768 --> 27:18.837
SYSTEM WITH LITTLE TO NO HELP.

27:18.903 --> 27:20.305
AT WHICH POINT, IT REALLY FEELS

27:20.372 --> 27:22.007
LIKE OUR SYSTEM IS ESSENTIALLY

27:22.073 --> 27:23.241
"GUILTY UNTIL PROVEN RICH OR

27:23.308 --> 27:24.743
LUCKY."

27:24.809 --> 27:26.911
AND THAT HAS TO CHANGE, BECAUSE

27:26.978 --> 27:29.114
WE CAN'T KEEP LETTING THE MOST

27:29.180 --> 27:29.981
VULNERABLE BE CASUALTIES OF A

27:30.048 --> 27:31.616
SYSTEM THAT CARES MORE ABOUT

27:31.683 --> 27:33.351
QUICK AND FINAL DECISIONS THAN

27:33.418 --> 27:35.653
ACTUALLY CORRECT ONES.

27:35.720 --> 27:36.821
THAT'S MY VERDICT,

27:36.888 --> 27:37.856
AND THAT'S HOW I SEE IT.

27:37.922 --> 27:42.460
CLOMP CLOMP.

27:42.527 --> 27:43.328
MOTHERFUCKERS.

27:43.395 --> 27:44.129
CLOMP CLOMP.

27:44.195 --> 27:46.731
AND NOW THIS.

27:46.798 --> 27:51.269
>> Announcer: NOW GREAT

27:51.336 --> 27:51.803
MOMENTS IN STEVE HARVEY'S

27:51.870 --> 27:53.805
JURISPRUDENCE.

27:53.872 --> 27:56.007
>> I'M ABOUT TO HEAR A SERIES OF

27:56.074 --> 27:57.609
UNBELIEVABLE STATEMENTS.

27:57.675 --> 28:00.912
WE ARE ARGUING ABOUT ASS?

28:00.979 --> 28:01.746
I'M SORRY.

28:01.813 --> 28:02.714
I'M SORRY.

28:02.781 --> 28:04.149
THIS IS NOT FUNNY.

28:04.215 --> 28:05.784
>> NO, IT'S NOT.

28:05.850 --> 28:07.919
>> IT'S REALLY NOT FUNNY.

28:07.986 --> 28:10.321
YOU ARE WAY MORE STUPID THAN I

28:10.388 --> 28:10.722
THOUGHT YOU WERE.

28:10.789 --> 28:11.589
LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING.

28:11.656 --> 28:13.858
YOU AIN'T GOING TO GET NOBODY

28:13.925 --> 28:16.461
FINER THAN THAT.

28:16.528 --> 28:17.896
YOU CAN'T OBJECT BECAUSE YOU'RE

28:17.962 --> 28:22.567
NOT A LAWYER.

28:22.634 --> 28:29.007
IS THAT A PAIR OF HANDCUFFS WITH

28:29.074 --> 28:33.478
CORN ON THE COB WITH A CONDOM ON

28:33.545 --> 28:34.079
IT?

28:34.145 --> 28:35.713
YOU ARE FIXING TO HAVE ONE OF A

28:35.780 --> 28:37.515
PARTY.

28:37.582 --> 28:41.386
THAT'S THE WAY I SEE IT.

28:41.453 --> 28:43.521
>> John: THAT'S OUR SHOW.

28:43.588 --> 28:45.023
THANKS SO MUCH FOR WATCHING.

28:45.090 --> 28:46.091
SEE YOU NEXT WEEK.
