You know what?

10:06.710 --> 10:09.500
We can figure this out.

10:09.500 --> 10:12.500
Where would the dress
have been restocked?

10:18.500 --> 10:21.000
Why did we think
this was the easy job?

10:24.580 --> 10:27.580
This buck-kid list
doesn't stand a chance.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.540
Okay, people,
now butter it up.

10:30.540 --> 10:31.750

No! Come on.

12:01.290 --> 12:04.790
Huh. It says,
"will stain clothes."

12:04.790 --> 12:06.880
Skin is the clothes
of your body,

12:06.880 --> 12:09.000
so there you go.

12:09.000 --> 12:11.500

Well, in your defense,
you are still a child.

My quinceañera's in...

12:22.920 --> 12:24.330
two hours!

12:25.880 --> 12:27.830
As a father, you have to make
a lot of tough decisions.

12:27.830 --> 12:29.960
But this was the toughest.

12:29.960 --> 12:32.210
Taffeta or chiffon.

12:32.210 --> 12:34.120
-This is satin.

Oh, good,
you got the dress.

Ha, ha, ha. Yeah, I get it.
It's horrible.

12:46.380 --> 12:48.500
No, but really,
where's Harley's dress?

12:51.000 --> 12:52.290
No.

12:52.290 --> 12:54.330
Uh, little snafu.

12:54.330 --> 12:55.580
By the time we got there--

12:55.580 --> 12:57.290
By the time
you got there?

12:57.290 --> 12:59.330
Guys, I wrote it down!

12:59.330 --> 13:02.790
I gave you the easiest job,
and you still messed it up?

13:02.790 --> 13:04.460
How'd the centerpieces
turn out?

13:04.460 --> 13:06.080
Great.

13:06.080 --> 13:08.000
I just followed
the directions.

13:08.000 --> 13:09.500
These directions?

13:09.500 --> 13:11.790
You wrote the dress pickup
instructions here.

13:13.960 --> 13:16.080
So, if we're keeping track,

13:16.080 --> 13:17.250
you guys messed up
more than us.

13:17.250 --> 13:19.040
And you didn't even
get ice cream.

13:19.040 --> 13:20.540
You got ice cream?

13:20.540 --> 13:22.040
[gasps]
Congratulations.

13:22.040 --> 13:23.960
You ruined
Harley's quince.

13:23.960 --> 13:26.330
[Harley]
Actually...

13:26.330 --> 13:28.790
Harley did that
all by herself.

13:30.170 --> 13:31.670
You're purple.

13:31.670 --> 13:34.080
Was one of the things
on your list "be a grape"?

13:34.080 --> 13:35.290
[laughs]

13:35.290 --> 13:38.000
I've taken two showers,
and it still won't come off.

13:38.000 --> 13:41.620
I don't know, it kind of
gives you a nice, rosy...

13:41.620 --> 13:43.580
yeah, I can't spin this.

13:43.580 --> 13:45.540
I never should have
given up control.

13:45.540 --> 13:46.790
This is a nightmare.

13:46.790 --> 13:48.580
Hello?

13:51.580 --> 13:53.960
-[all cheer]
-[Tom] Rachel's here!

13:53.960 --> 13:55.620

Rachel!

13:58.620 --> 14:00.170
Rachel, you said
you couldn't be here.

14:00.170 --> 14:02.210
Changed my mind.
I told Christian Lamond

14:02.210 --> 14:04.420
he could fire me,
but I'm going.

14:04.420 --> 14:06.330
Turns out, he likes a girl
with 'tude.

14:06.330 --> 14:07.790
Then you're going
to be a superstar.

14:07.790 --> 14:09.080
[all laugh]

14:09.080 --> 14:11.080
Yeah, well, I don't
have enough 'tude

14:11.080 --> 14:14.170
to pull off this look
at my quince, so...

14:14.170 --> 14:15.670
Oh, no, no, no, no.

14:15.670 --> 14:18.290
I did not fly across the ocean
for a big party

14:18.290 --> 14:21.120
to have this family ruin it
with their Diaz-ness.

14:21.120 --> 14:23.000
I love your enthusiasm,
but we only have an hour

14:23.000 --> 14:25.120
and I look like pie filling.

14:25.120 --> 14:27.620
Soaking in a tub of fresh
lemon juice and vinegar

14:27.620 --> 14:29.250
will remove any stain.

14:30.880 --> 14:33.120
What? My clothes, this house?

14:33.120 --> 14:34.920
You think I don't know
how to remove a stain?

14:36.420 --> 14:38.040
You guys, we need every lemon

14:38.040 --> 14:39.120
from Miss Peters'
greenhouse.

14:39.120 --> 14:40.960
-Got it.
-Dad, Ethan...

14:40.960 --> 14:42.830
Oh, please be
the easy thing.

14:42.830 --> 14:44.290
No! I don't know
what that means anymore.

14:44.290 --> 14:45.710
Go back to the store.

14:45.710 --> 14:47.080
I'll text you a picture
of the dress,

14:47.080 --> 14:50.880
and pretend I'm not related to
the people that picked out that.

14:50.880 --> 14:53.080
Mom, Georgie,

14:53.080 --> 14:55.920
take the instructions and make
those dorky centerpieces

14:55.920 --> 14:57.210
how Harley wanted them.

14:57.210 --> 14:59.210
[Harley]
Hey, they're not dorky.

14:59.210 --> 15:00.830
They're just
molecular compounds...

15:00.830 --> 15:02.080
okay, yeah.

15:02.080 --> 15:03.250
[laughs]

15:03.250 --> 15:06.120
You have no idea
how much this means--

15:06.120 --> 15:07.540
Save the sweet.
You need to soak

15:07.540 --> 15:09.000
so I can make you look
more princess

15:09.000 --> 15:11.250
and less Papa Snoozleberry.

15:18.540 --> 15:21.960
Well, for a family that just
got dressed on the drive over,

15:21.960 --> 15:23.790
I think we clean up
pretty nice.

15:23.790 --> 15:25.750
Luckily, we run late a lot,
and most of the makeup's

15:25.750 --> 15:27.420
already in
the glove compartment.

15:27.420 --> 15:28.670
[gasps]

15:28.670 --> 15:30.250
[all]
Wow.

15:30.250 --> 15:32.250
[Georgie]
I hope things are working out
with Harley.

15:32.250 --> 15:34.000
Oh, Rachel just texted me
from the cab.

15:34.000 --> 15:37.420
Is this emoji laughing-crying,
or crying-crying?

15:37.420 --> 15:39.080
-Laughing.
-Crying.

15:40.880 --> 15:42.420
-Hey.
-How'd it go?

15:43.420 --> 15:45.210
We did everything we could,

15:45.210 --> 15:47.420
but all the lemons
in the world couldn't--

15:47.420 --> 15:48.880
[Harley]
Hey, guys.

15:52.710 --> 15:54.170
I heard there was a party?

15:58.080 --> 15:59.210
Oh, come on,
you were supposed

15:59.210 --> 16:01.080
to let them suffer
a little longer.

16:02.290 --> 16:04.250
[all cheer]

16:08.420 --> 16:10.830
Wow, look at this place.

16:10.830 --> 16:12.170
It's amazing.

16:12.170 --> 16:13.790
I wasn't sure you guys
could pull it off,

16:13.790 --> 16:17.540
but everything
turned out perfect.

16:17.540 --> 16:18.920
When I become an adult,

16:18.920 --> 16:20.420
I'm gonna start
letting you guys do more.

16:20.420 --> 16:21.670
[all laugh]

16:21.670 --> 16:23.380
Thank you, Harls.

16:24.460 --> 16:26.080
And you look gorgeous.

16:26.080 --> 16:27.330
Thank you.

16:27.330 --> 16:28.750
Rotten bananas,
rotten bananas.

16:28.750 --> 16:30.040
[sniffles]

16:30.040 --> 16:31.460
I'm trying not to cry.

16:31.460 --> 16:33.460
I can't pinch my ear,
because my nails are wet.

16:33.460 --> 16:35.330
Chocolate fountain!

16:35.330 --> 16:36.880
[Beast]
Yeah!

16:38.460 --> 16:40.080
Ellie!

16:40.080 --> 16:41.380
[both laugh]

16:41.380 --> 16:42.380
-Hey.
-Hey!

16:42.380 --> 16:44.790
You smell like lemonade.

16:44.790 --> 16:46.290
Yeah, long story.

16:46.290 --> 16:48.670
I could charge 25 cents
for a cup of my sweat.

16:49.670 --> 16:51.380
Time for my present.

16:52.620 --> 16:55.420
I made it because one Harley
is not enough.

16:55.420 --> 16:57.000
Especially on her quince,

16:57.000 --> 16:58.880
when everybody wants
to get a picture.

17:01.170 --> 17:04.790
It has changeable faces to take
you through the whole night.

17:04.790 --> 17:08.170
Beaming Harley,
dancing Harley,

17:08.170 --> 17:10.040
emotional Harley,

17:10.040 --> 17:11.960
no-more-cake-I'll-burst
Harley.

17:11.960 --> 17:14.080
I was only going to go
with one face,

17:14.080 --> 17:17.830
but it was impossible
which one of you I liked best.

17:17.830 --> 17:19.460
I love it.

17:19.460 --> 17:21.040
There's only one Ellie,

17:21.040 --> 17:24.170
and I'm so lucky to have her
as my best friend.

17:26.290 --> 17:27.880
-Let's take a selfie.
-Okay.

17:29.080 --> 17:30.330
[camera shutters click]

17:30.330 --> 17:31.880
Hey, we're about to let
the guests in.

17:31.880 --> 17:34.250
So unless your entrance
is some type of

17:34.250 --> 17:36.120
"before and after" thing,
you better go.

17:36.120 --> 17:37.500
[watch beeps]

17:37.500 --> 17:39.960
Right on schedule.
Time for my grand entrance.

17:39.960 --> 17:43.040
It's been six months of blood,
sweat and tears.

17:43.040 --> 17:44.540
Well, no tears.

17:44.540 --> 17:46.580
But those will be coming
from you,

17:46.580 --> 17:49.170
because this is going
to blow your mind.

17:51.500 --> 17:52.710
Where's the box I brought
from home?

17:52.710 --> 17:55.540
Uh, box?
I don't see a box.

17:55.540 --> 17:58.500
It said "Science Jokes and
Puzzles" on it, and it's gone.

17:58.500 --> 18:00.080
Oh, then you're better off.

18:00.080 --> 18:01.960
I had it when
I left the house.

18:01.960 --> 18:05.250
I remember I put it
on top of the taxi...

18:09.250 --> 18:10.500
Oh, no.

18:11.540 --> 18:12.540
No!

18:12.540 --> 18:13.960
My grand entrance
into adulthood

18:13.960 --> 18:16.080
just blew off the top
of a taxi.

18:16.080 --> 18:17.670
I was going to...

18:19.460 --> 18:21.000
doesn't matter now.

18:21.000 --> 18:23.460
There's no need for you
to be as disappointed as me.

18:26.000 --> 18:29.330
I've looked forward to this day
for 15 years,

18:29.330 --> 18:30.670
and now...

18:33.710 --> 18:35.580
I'm going to need
a minute.

18:45.830 --> 18:47.710
I can't believe it.

18:47.710 --> 18:51.540
I was so worried
about you guys messing up.

18:51.540 --> 18:54.540
And I made the one mistake
that can't be fixed.

18:54.540 --> 18:56.250
But you're Harley.

18:56.250 --> 18:58.620
You can fix anything.

18:58.620 --> 19:01.710
Yeah, this isn't our first
quince dark moment.

19:01.710 --> 19:03.500
[sighs]

19:04.500 --> 19:06.040
Remember mine?

19:06.040 --> 19:08.330
I sprained my ankle,
a hurricane hit.

19:08.330 --> 19:09.830
I was ready to give up.

19:09.830 --> 19:12.830
But you built a hoverboard
so I could dance.

19:12.830 --> 19:14.710
That's what you do.

19:14.710 --> 19:17.620
You turn Diaz disasters
into opportunities.

19:18.670 --> 19:20.750
Plus...

19:20.750 --> 19:24.750
this dress is way too nice for
you to be crying in a corner.

19:24.750 --> 19:28.170
So get off your flowery butt
and make it work.

19:29.790 --> 19:31.830
Thanks, guys.

19:31.830 --> 19:34.540
But part of growing up

19:34.540 --> 19:37.920
is accepting that there are
some things even I can't fix.

19:37.920 --> 19:40.620
Aww, sounds like someone needs
one of my famous

19:40.620 --> 19:42.210
heartfelt speeches.

19:42.210 --> 19:43.620
[clears throat]

19:43.620 --> 19:46.920
Now, Harley,
have you ever been...

19:46.920 --> 19:48.290
Stop.

19:50.960 --> 19:52.670
Trust me, I've done it
a thousand times.

19:52.670 --> 19:54.460
It'll work.

19:54.460 --> 19:57.790
Now, Harley,
have you ever been--

19:57.790 --> 19:59.960
No, I mean stop.

20:02.460 --> 20:04.460
I just got an idea.

20:04.460 --> 20:06.580
Give me 10 minutes,
then gather everyone.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.620
I've got a grand entrance
to make.

20:09.960 --> 20:12.920
I'm still taking credit
for that.

20:12.920 --> 20:16.790
And now, the moment we have
all been waiting for.

20:16.790 --> 20:19.000
Introducing our
quinceañera queen:

20:19.000 --> 20:21.960
element Hd15,

20:21.960 --> 20:26.330
more commonly known
as Harley Diaz!

20:26.330 --> 20:27.830
[cheers and applause]

20:33.000 --> 20:35.000
-Oh!
-Oh, no.

20:35.000 --> 20:38.460
