00:57.160 --> 00:58.844
Are you scared?

01:00.640 --> 01:02.449
Of course you are.

01:13.080 --> 01:15.128
Your mother is dying,

01:15.560 --> 01:17.324
and the world is on fire.

01:22.360 --> 01:25.330
If history teaches us one thing,

01:26.200 --> 01:27.200
it is this:

01:29.560 --> 01:32.086
terrible things happen to kings.

01:46.600 --> 01:49.763
<i>You were anointed by God,</i>

01:51.400 --> 01:53.528
<i>blessed by the sun,</i>

01:56.320 --> 02:00.564
<i>but you do not yet possess
what really matters:</i>

02:02.800 --> 02:04.290
<i>the power!</i>

02:06.600 --> 02:08.125
<i>Without it,</i>

02:08.720 --> 02:10.370
<i>you will perish,</i>

02:11.360 --> 02:14.045
<i>and all of France along with you.</i>

02:17.040 --> 02:19.646
<i>For a king without a castle</i>

02:21.400 --> 02:23.926
<i>is no king at all.</i>

02:28.680 --> 02:30.045
<i>And now,</i>

02:30.960 --> 02:34.123
<i>you dream of paradise,</i>

02:35.880 --> 02:39.009
<i>but you must build it for yourself.</i>

02:40.520 --> 02:43.808
<i>And let all the world know</i>

02:45.280 --> 02:49.251
<i>Louis the Great has arrived!</i>

03:18.200 --> 03:19.440
I had a vision,

03:20.600 --> 03:21.806
about a palace.

03:23.880 --> 03:25.962
Bring my architect, to Versailles.

03:26.120 --> 03:27.326
<i>Mr Le Van'?</i>

03:27.720 --> 03:29.210
To talk about mirrors.

03:30.800 --> 03:32.609
How is my queen, Bontemps?

03:33.280 --> 03:35.328
Everyone says it shall be a boy.

03:43.560 --> 03:45.801
- What is it?
- An attempt on the king's life.

03:45.960 --> 03:47.849
By whom? The Spanish, the Dutch?

03:48.000 --> 03:50.890
We do not know
Fabien is moving to quell the threat.

03:51.400 --> 03:52.526
Bontemps, explain!

03:52.680 --> 03:55.923
Sire, you must be escorted
to the guard room immediately!

03:57.160 --> 03:59.208
<i>Who says'?</i>

03:59.480 --> 04:01.687
Sire, away from the window!

04:01.840 --> 04:03.205
I do not know these men!

04:03.360 --> 04:06.364
I'm going nowhere,
my second son will be born here!

04:06.720 --> 04:09.769
While I breathe I will not show fear!
I will not leave!

04:10.080 --> 04:11.605
Philippe, where is he?

04:11.920 --> 04:13.490
Where is my brother?

04:13.920 --> 04:15.888
- Where is he?
- Your majesty!

04:16.680 --> 04:18.170
You must come with us.

04:25.680 --> 04:27.921
Oh God! You are good at that.

04:31.560 --> 04:32.560
The king calls!

04:32.600 --> 04:35.763
We heard you the first time!

04:36.000 --> 04:39.083
- Is the baby born?
- You are to come at once!

04:41.440 --> 04:44.569
- I'll send for a snack.
- Couldn't eat another thing.

04:54.760 --> 04:58.560
- Have they caught the men?
- Fabien Marchal is leading the search.

05:03.320 --> 05:04.970
Tell me what is going on.

05:06.640 --> 05:07.641
Brother,

05:09.000 --> 05:11.924
another plot uncovered,
this time it was four men

05:13.160 --> 05:14.844
sent to kill you.

05:16.720 --> 05:19.451
We must leave for Paris,
this Lodge is not safe.

05:19.600 --> 05:21.409
I decide where I go!

05:23.120 --> 05:24.804
I decide what to do.

05:30.760 --> 05:32.171
Make them go away.

05:34.440 --> 05:35.566
Leave us!

05:37.840 --> 05:39.205
You too, Montcourt.

05:49.320 --> 05:50.845
You had that dream again.

05:51.000 --> 05:53.207
You held her hand when she died.

05:53.960 --> 05:55.325
You could have too.

05:56.280 --> 05:58.248
They didn't permit me that honor.

05:58.400 --> 05:59.925
Who permits the king?

06:00.080 --> 06:01.491
You'll never understand.

06:01.640 --> 06:03.722
There's something bigger than you!

06:07.880 --> 06:09.848
The king has not given you leave.

06:12.240 --> 06:15.767
My dear Bontemps, I know that look,
someone's about to get hurl

06:16.920 --> 06:17.648
Won't be me.

06:17.800 --> 06:20.280
They mean to kill me, let them try!

06:23.040 --> 06:24.371
You have the power.

06:26.480 --> 06:27.481
Believe it.

06:34.160 --> 06:38.449
The deer in those woods follow
the same tracks at their ancestors.

06:40.640 --> 06:42.404
Going back hundreds of years.

06:44.840 --> 06:47.923
It's instinct, they simply follow.

06:51.840 --> 06:54.047
Once in a while, one will turn.

06:56.240 --> 06:59.323
But those who challenge never win,
for one reason

07:01.760 --> 07:03.250
If you blindfolded me

07:03.400 --> 07:06.961
in that wood, and turned me around
I'd find my way back.

07:08.680 --> 07:10.011
No path I don't know

07:11.160 --> 07:13.367
No tree I haven't climbed.

07:15.960 --> 07:17.041
It's where I hunt.

07:18.120 --> 07:19.849
It's where we will stay.

07:20.280 --> 07:21.850
We're not going anywhere.

07:24.200 --> 07:25.531
You may leave now.

07:35.880 --> 07:37.370
Fine day for a walk.

07:38.720 --> 07:40.882
Have you lost your way gentlemen?

07:43.040 --> 07:46.010
I think Spain is in that direction.

08:00.720 --> 08:02.688
Since you are clearly lost,

08:03.400 --> 08:04.526
perhaps

08:06.400 --> 08:08.050
you know not where you are.

08:22.600 --> 08:24.967
My name is Fabien Marchal,

08:25.320 --> 08:27.322
my work protects the king.

08:27.680 --> 08:29.444
Welcome to Versailles.

09:06.840 --> 09:12.210
<i>* I'm the king of my own land,</i>

09:16.560 --> 09:19.882
<i>* Facing tempests of dust,</i>

09:20.040 --> 09:24.602
<i>* I'll fight until the end.</i>

09:28.720 --> 09:34.602
<i>* Creatures of my dreams,
rise up and dance with me!</i>

09:43.080 --> 09:50.331
<i>* Now and forever,
* I'm your king.</i>

10:33.360 --> 10:35.203
And now the taxes for Epernon.

10:37.480 --> 10:39.005
The harvest was poor.

10:40.680 --> 10:44.162
Secure the coffers and load
the carriages, four men to each.

10:44.840 --> 10:46.251
Deal with it later!

10:47.440 --> 10:48.566
What is this about?

10:50.040 --> 10:51.690
Fabien, who are they?

10:51.840 --> 10:54.446
Four Spanish mercenaries
plotting an ambush.

10:55.320 --> 10:56.970
They were prevented.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.168
We really are out in the wilds.

11:00.320 --> 11:02.288
Defences are porous, nonexistent.

11:02.920 --> 11:04.365
We must return to Paris.

11:05.200 --> 11:06.281
I do not believe

11:06.440 --> 11:09.569
the king, nor his valet,
fully sense the danger.

11:09.720 --> 11:11.529
In any case, it's not up to him.

11:12.480 --> 11:15.768
The ministers and council,
we all must guide the ship.

11:16.480 --> 11:18.767
Is the country governed by one man?

11:19.080 --> 11:22.607
Bontemps, is the king informed?
What does he say of this?

11:23.600 --> 11:24.681
Where is he?

11:25.960 --> 11:27.928
He said he would be here.

11:29.520 --> 11:30.806
We must find him.

11:32.960 --> 11:34.644
Calmly.

11:40.320 --> 11:42.209
Search all the corridors,

11:42.360 --> 11:44.681
the kitchen, just find the king!

11:53.760 --> 11:54.921
You cannot find him.

11:55.480 --> 11:57.608
You cannot find the king of France?

11:58.600 --> 12:02.207
While the king is lost
you must remain in place.

12:02.360 --> 12:04.124
He's not lost, I promise.

13:17.600 --> 13:18.840
What are you doing?

13:19.000 --> 13:20.490
You could've been killed!

13:21.960 --> 13:24.247
- Perhaps.
- Perhaps?

13:24.680 --> 13:26.409
You surpass yourself.

13:28.480 --> 13:30.403
We've never been more alone.

13:30.640 --> 13:31.448
We need to go.

13:31.600 --> 13:33.887
We'll never get this chance again.

13:34.320 --> 13:35.845
The wolves will come back.

13:36.000 --> 13:39.721
<i>I</i> am about to drag this country
out of the darkness, into the light

13:40.560 --> 13:42.369
We must build our own destiny.

13:42.520 --> 13:46.241
A new France will be born,
this palace will be here mother.

13:48.200 --> 13:51.204
- What palace?
- That one.

13:53.560 --> 13:55.085
The hunting lodge?

13:57.280 --> 13:58.611
Versailles.

14:01.280 --> 14:02.645
Get back on the horse.

14:04.040 --> 14:06.247
With great change enemies appear.

14:06.400 --> 14:10.166
I need to know one thing in this moment,
no matter what.

14:11.320 --> 14:13.209
Are you with me brother?

14:13.920 --> 14:14.920
Do you have my back?

14:18.240 --> 14:19.401
Where am I now?

14:30.120 --> 14:31.804
The king! The king!

14:33.240 --> 14:34.366
It's the king!

15:06.000 --> 15:09.368
My queen, this is Masson,
your new doctor.

15:09.920 --> 15:12.446
He will attend to you
and deliver the boy.

15:12.840 --> 15:13.840
Your Majesty,

15:14.120 --> 15:17.044
I consider this appointment
a great honor

15:17.600 --> 15:19.807
both to myself, and to my family.

15:22.800 --> 15:24.404
I think he waits for you.

15:25.160 --> 15:26.241
When do we go home?

15:27.240 --> 15:28.685
- Home?
- To Paris.

15:29.600 --> 15:32.410
The birthing bed is prepared.
We're not leaving.

15:32.840 --> 15:35.923
- Wouldn't you agree doctor'?
- Oh yes, Sire.

15:37.800 --> 15:39.484
I'm tired, my king.

15:49.880 --> 15:51.689
You're keeping us in suspense.

15:52.640 --> 15:55.211
I'm jealous you're going to mass
without me.

15:55.360 --> 15:57.283
It's for the child's welfare.

15:58.120 --> 15:59.326
As well <i>as</i> your own.

15:59.920 --> 16:02.127
Then let us go back to Paris.

16:10.400 --> 16:13.563
At least make them change
the tapestries <i>as</i> you promised.

16:14.280 --> 16:15.280
I will.

16:15.920 --> 16:17.968
I wish you kept more promises.

16:18.120 --> 16:20.361
The bed is very big without you.

16:23.000 --> 16:24.650
My proud Spanish queen.

16:26.480 --> 16:29.848
Sire, important matters of state.

16:35.080 --> 16:36.445
When the time comes,

16:37.360 --> 16:39.362
I don't want many people here.

16:41.440 --> 16:42.930
Why on earth not?

16:43.280 --> 16:45.408
I don't feel the same <i>as</i> last time.

16:48.120 --> 16:49.326
All will be well.

16:50.960 --> 16:51.961
Fear not.

17:00.080 --> 17:01.889
Tea, bring it now.

17:03.160 --> 17:04.207
Yes, my queen.

17:07.960 --> 17:11.681
- The baby is coming!
- Stop!

17:12.440 --> 17:14.442
Nabo, you naughty thing.

17:15.160 --> 17:16.160
Bed.

17:32.680 --> 17:34.409
You'll have been given a name.

17:35.360 --> 17:36.771
Only Calderon knows.

17:37.520 --> 17:39.045
He said we'd receive word.

17:41.200 --> 17:42.440
This?

17:42.960 --> 17:44.689
No! I've never seen it before!

17:46.520 --> 17:48.887
No! No! No please!

17:49.040 --> 17:50.849
Please!

17:54.080 --> 17:57.129
Please! Please!

18:01.120 --> 18:02.121
Please!

18:23.840 --> 18:26.286
When I return, the name.

19:08.120 --> 19:09.451
You look frozen.

19:11.120 --> 19:13.168
Quite warm, thank you.

19:15.240 --> 19:16.685
Spring is sprung.

19:18.360 --> 19:20.010
Apparently so.

19:26.360 --> 19:27.805
How is your husband?

19:28.360 --> 19:30.681
Please, do not talk about him now.

19:34.200 --> 19:36.123
You made me marry him.

19:37.720 --> 19:39.324
To keep you here.

19:56.760 --> 19:58.125
And about your husband,

19:58.280 --> 20:00.886
you're to tell me everything he says,

20:01.680 --> 20:03.444
and everything he does.

20:13.240 --> 20:14.605
Thought I'd lost you.

20:15.120 --> 20:17.805
- I was worried about you.
- No you weren't.

20:19.000 --> 20:21.207
- What are you doing?
- Packing.

20:21.880 --> 20:24.406
You're not staying here are you?

20:25.120 --> 20:28.329
They just tried to kill the king.
Who's next?

20:28.480 --> 20:30.050
Now there's any idea.

20:31.160 --> 20:32.286
You'd have me killed?

20:33.840 --> 20:35.569
You're so slow sometimes.

20:37.600 --> 20:39.807
The prince, little Louis,

20:39.960 --> 20:42.247
he's always seemed a bit sickly.

20:43.240 --> 20:44.287
Stop it!

20:44.600 --> 20:46.045
My point exactly.

20:46.680 --> 20:49.604
Hardly anyone sees him,
he's holed up in Paris,

20:49.760 --> 20:52.127
and everybody worries about his health.

20:52.800 --> 20:56.600
How many children at court
make it to the age of five?

20:58.120 --> 21:01.442
What chance does this latest one have
of walking,

21:01.600 --> 21:03.921
let alone to his own coronation?

21:04.560 --> 21:06.881
That's why the king wants another boy.

21:08.160 --> 21:11.960
It's why everyone is willing
another male child into existence.

21:12.840 --> 21:13.840
Don't you see?

21:14.920 --> 21:18.766
When it all falls down,
it all comes to you.

21:29.760 --> 21:32.286
And what would you do, on that day?

21:33.160 --> 21:35.003
With all that power?

21:37.640 --> 21:39.244
What would you do right now?

21:40.280 --> 21:42.886
Would you consign us
to linger in the swamp?

21:43.480 --> 21:45.005
Heavens, no!

21:46.320 --> 21:49.563
You would make Paris the capital
of the world,

21:49.720 --> 21:52.007
and we would dine and dance every night.

21:56.120 --> 21:58.691
What kind of king goes off hunting
alone,

21:59.440 --> 22:00.930
and then gets lost!

22:01.680 --> 22:03.887
He's lost all sense of himself.

22:04.320 --> 22:06.129
He's even lost himself.

22:06.600 --> 22:08.045
What a prize idiot!

22:17.040 --> 22:18.166
What's this now?

22:19.480 --> 22:21.130
You were trying to rule me?

22:24.280 --> 22:26.362
Don't talk about him like that.

22:27.120 --> 22:29.009
You know me by now, Mignonette.

22:29.880 --> 22:32.531
I talk in whatever way I choose.

22:46.080 --> 22:49.846
Do not judge a man by his words,
but by his actions.

22:50.280 --> 22:51.520
And do not worry.

22:53.120 --> 22:55.487
I will be a merciful king.

23:01.520 --> 23:02.520
Sire,

23:03.520 --> 23:06.683
in my humble opinion
information is power.

23:07.320 --> 23:11.882
That is one of 948 journals

23:12.320 --> 23:14.084
gathered by our services

23:14.520 --> 23:17.251
detailing every single member
of your court.

23:18.120 --> 23:21.203
Their height, weight,
hair and eye color,

23:21.360 --> 23:24.523
their daily movements, from your valet,

23:25.400 --> 23:29.041
to your cook's assistant,
Madeleine Dubois.

23:31.280 --> 23:34.011
You sire, are the sun,

23:36.440 --> 23:38.966
and around you circulate

23:39.520 --> 23:41.488
not just our celestial court

23:42.320 --> 23:44.288
but those who seek to harm you.

23:44.840 --> 23:47.207
You have ministers who openly defy you,

23:48.600 --> 23:50.409
nobles who pay no tax,

23:50.560 --> 23:53.609
yet believe that France is theirs,
not yours.

23:54.280 --> 23:57.363
Then, beyond our borders,

23:57.720 --> 24:00.371
the Dutch, Spain,

24:00.520 --> 24:04.127
the English, and the Holy Roman Empire.

24:06.280 --> 24:10.205
All who surround will smile,

24:10.480 --> 24:12.005
and they will kneel,

24:13.320 --> 24:15.322
but they'd all see you destroyed.

24:17.520 --> 24:20.888
A strong France scares them,
as well it should.

24:22.200 --> 24:24.009
You'd wish a weak France?

24:24.480 --> 24:27.086
I wish for the power to protect
his Majesty.

24:27.240 --> 24:29.447
You have sufficient resources.

24:29.880 --> 24:31.325
Give him what he needs.

24:36.400 --> 24:38.448
At your discretion of course!

24:55.160 --> 24:58.209
A risk moving the queen now, isn't it?

25:00.960 --> 25:03.930
With any luck
they'll leave her on the roof.

25:04.240 --> 25:07.164
Anyway, they've requested a birthing bed

25:07.320 --> 25:10.369
so I doubt she's going anywhere.

25:10.520 --> 25:12.090
Everyone's saying a boy.

25:12.800 --> 25:14.450
She's carrying in the front.

25:15.000 --> 25:18.447
I hope it is for her sake
not to mention the child's.

25:18.600 --> 25:20.204
Boys have all the fun.

25:21.360 --> 25:23.442
Your husband is staring at you.

25:39.400 --> 25:41.243
I must go down for Communion.

25:42.760 --> 25:44.728
I shouldn't be here, it's wrong.

25:47.800 --> 25:50.041
Piety becomes you, Mademoiselle.

25:54.720 --> 25:55.960
I want you.

25:58.720 --> 26:01.405
I serve your Majesty <i>as</i> I serve God.

26:02.560 --> 26:03.766
With all my heart.

26:10.120 --> 26:11.120
You're so dear.

26:19.640 --> 26:21.324
I hope for a healthy child.

26:29.520 --> 26:30.806
No matter what,

26:31.760 --> 26:34.366
he will be a child of France.

26:35.600 --> 26:37.409
Of that you can be sure.

26:45.680 --> 26:47.887
Chapel, the most pious day of the week.

26:48.040 --> 26:50.566
The king and his mistress gazing down
on us.

26:51.120 --> 26:54.488
I can't stand it.
Do they realize who we're praying for?

26:54.640 --> 26:57.769
I would wager Fabien Marchal prays
for peace,

26:57.920 --> 27:02.369
Louvois for war,
and Philippe prays only to me.

27:02.520 --> 27:07.003
All of them wondering why La Valiere
is up there when we know she's finished.

27:08.440 --> 27:10.681
I wonder what the king sees in her.

27:10.840 --> 27:12.888
I suppose he sees poise.

27:14.800 --> 27:16.211
Unlike some.

27:18.520 --> 27:19.851
Stop slouching!

27:21.000 --> 27:22.843
I need new shoes, mother.

27:23.000 --> 27:25.128
It's not the shoes, it's the feet.

27:26.720 --> 27:29.200
Slow down, eyes up, chin down.

27:30.440 --> 27:32.966
You're either looking
or being looked at.

27:35.080 --> 27:37.481
Walking is a skill my dear
like dancing.

27:39.360 --> 27:42.762
Why does the king ignore her
when she's the court's beauty.

27:42.920 --> 27:46.049
The king cares more about character.

27:46.200 --> 27:48.646
It's no surprise
he does not look on her.

27:51.400 --> 27:53.323
- Why thank you, Chevalier.
- Don't mention it.

28:14.320 --> 28:16.721
That one's actually more interesting.

28:16.880 --> 28:20.009
Young woman died of a stopping
of the stomach.

28:20.800 --> 28:23.485
Or perhaps a raising of the lights.

28:25.600 --> 28:27.125
Or bloodletting.

28:29.160 --> 28:32.687
The letting of blood purges the body
of its ills.

28:33.440 --> 28:35.363
It's a cornerstone of medicine.

28:36.080 --> 28:39.641
It seems to me that doctors
stand before corpses

28:39.800 --> 28:41.165
stating reasons of death

28:41.320 --> 28:44.529
yet I wonder if they omit
the most obvious cause.

28:44.920 --> 28:46.081
What would that be?

28:46.640 --> 28:47.880
Their incompetence.

28:51.240 --> 28:52.241
Father!

28:52.680 --> 28:54.284
Strong... and stubborn.

28:55.600 --> 28:57.090
Please listen to me!

28:57.240 --> 28:59.322
Doesn't it demand a question?

29:00.560 --> 29:04.610
If the Lord himself ministered
to these children, would he blood-let?

29:04.960 --> 29:07.804
Claudine, my dear girl, look,

29:08.160 --> 29:10.447
I know that you are clever and kind.

29:11.240 --> 29:12.651
But people will see you

29:12.800 --> 29:15.280
a woman of knowledge

29:16.840 --> 29:18.604
who speaks her mind

29:19.960 --> 29:22.008
and they would use a different word

29:22.160 --> 29:24.811
- The word they would use...
- A witch!

29:26.040 --> 29:27.121
You'll be burned!

29:35.520 --> 29:37.010
So, we are being robbed.

29:37.360 --> 29:39.966
- Sire?
- The tax revenues you outlined.

29:40.120 --> 29:43.090
Nantes down 7%, Limousin down 14%,

29:43.240 --> 29:47.650
Anjou down 21%, and
Epernon down 25%.

29:48.520 --> 29:49.520
Robbery!

29:51.240 --> 29:53.322
They do not fear the consequences.

29:54.520 --> 29:58.889
What is worse, they steal from
the people of France in my name.

29:59.480 --> 30:01.289
A common thief in a silk shirt.

30:01.440 --> 30:05.240
Sire, the expenses you requested,
the Royal pension.

30:06.240 --> 30:09.289
Sire, the taxation issue
is a tedious mess

30:09.440 --> 30:12.569
and I would have your attention
on other matters.

30:12.920 --> 30:16.845
This administrative issue can be solved
once we return to Paris.

30:17.000 --> 30:18.081
To the archives.

30:18.240 --> 30:20.641
Who's our tax man in Epernon.

30:23.440 --> 30:24.440
Your Majesty!

30:25.640 --> 30:27.085
Who interrupts?

30:27.240 --> 30:30.403
Urgent from your wife, Mr Bontemps.

30:38.960 --> 30:39.960
Read it.

30:40.560 --> 30:42.767
- When we finish...
- Then I shall, give it to me.

31:01.560 --> 31:03.244
Go back to your family at once

31:03.680 --> 31:06.081
take a Swiss with you,
there are bandits.

31:16.680 --> 31:18.409
- Fabien.
- Yes, sire.

31:18.680 --> 31:20.921
Who's our exciseman of Epernon?

31:21.840 --> 31:23.001
Educate him.

31:27.000 --> 31:28.240
Let me be clear.

31:28.640 --> 31:32.008
The state of our finances will not pass
through these doors.

31:32.160 --> 31:36.768
As far as the world is concerned
our cash flow is strong.

31:37.480 --> 31:38.811
Is that understood?

31:40.320 --> 31:41.526
Was he short before?

31:42.160 --> 31:44.561
We'd need to consult our archives

31:44.880 --> 31:46.769
- In Paris.
- Good point, Louvois.

31:47.840 --> 31:48.840
Bring them here.

32:02.800 --> 32:04.768
Only four women have their cycle,

32:04.920 --> 32:08.367
Claremont, Montbeliard,
Anjou and Poitier.

32:10.240 --> 32:14.484
Poitier keeps saying she's pregnant,
but, she's not.

32:15.560 --> 32:17.483
I must do something for the king.

32:19.440 --> 32:23.650
Bring me my book of names from Epernon
and bordering parishes.

32:25.480 --> 32:26.811
It's the red one.

32:28.840 --> 32:30.285
What are you looking for?

32:33.200 --> 32:34.964
Looking for Mr Dupont.

32:44.600 --> 32:45.726
I will return.

33:37.840 --> 33:39.251
There, him.

33:43.400 --> 33:46.609
- What would you like?
- You to get your hands off me.

33:46.760 --> 33:47.760
Hey!

33:48.160 --> 33:49.400
But sir...

34:00.240 --> 34:01.605
Dupont!

34:03.320 --> 34:05.004
After what happened to Fouquet

34:05.360 --> 34:07.203
I'd have thought you learned

34:07.360 --> 34:11.364
Remind me, as a tax collector,
you can count, can't you?

34:12.719 --> 34:14.404
Even in Epernon?

34:14.719 --> 34:17.166
For future reference, so can we.

34:31.679 --> 34:33.205
Compliments of the King.

34:42.760 --> 34:45.127
Moncourt, you seem pensive.

34:49.000 --> 34:51.367
The king ordered the archives
from Paris?

34:51.520 --> 34:53.123
He's not a boy anymore,

34:53.639 --> 34:56.371
the king's become a man.
He has big ideas.

34:57.200 --> 35:00.283
And this I fear, is as big as they come.

35:05.880 --> 35:08.167
As I said before the envelope should

35:08.320 --> 35:10.766
be completed around the entire lodge.

35:10.920 --> 35:12.604
Along the terrace, inside,

35:13.080 --> 35:15.845
a great hall of mirrors reflected
in the symmetry.

35:17.080 --> 35:19.890
We'll need to buy in most of Venice
for the glass.

35:20.480 --> 35:23.723
Now the gardens will extend
from here to here.

35:23.880 --> 35:26.008
Very good Sire. What is this?

35:27.160 --> 35:28.571
A lake.

35:28.720 --> 35:30.529
You wish to put a lake here?

35:30.680 --> 35:32.364
The area is the lake.

35:33.480 --> 35:34.891
That is... a big lake.

35:35.480 --> 35:37.403
Sire, a lake that size

35:37.600 --> 35:40.331
would dwarf any structure near it.

35:40.880 --> 35:43.247
That depends on the structure,
does it not?

35:43.840 --> 35:45.842
But to feed such a lake,
your majesty

35:46.440 --> 35:48.681
there aren't enough rivers nearby.

35:50.440 --> 35:51.930
Bring the rivers here.

36:09.120 --> 36:11.088
Sir, you are my gardener.

36:12.680 --> 36:13.680
Your majesty.

36:14.200 --> 36:15.884
How long have you worked here?

36:17.560 --> 36:18.800
Six months, Sire.

36:19.120 --> 36:21.521
- And before that?
- War.

36:22.120 --> 36:24.964
- What happened to your arm?
- I left it on a field.

36:25.120 --> 36:26.724
How forgetful of you.

36:31.280 --> 36:33.681
What qualifies a soldier for gardening?

36:34.360 --> 36:37.967
- I'm very skilled at digging, Sire.
- Trenches, yes.

36:38.880 --> 36:40.041
Graves.

36:41.600 --> 36:43.409
Also the planning for a garden

36:43.560 --> 36:46.166
is not so different than
planning for war.

36:48.240 --> 36:52.404
A war fought for beauty against chaos.

36:56.720 --> 36:58.051
Dig me a lake.

37:00.160 --> 37:02.288
- How big?
- Half a league.

37:03.960 --> 37:07.043
That would take me some time, Sire.
Might need a hand.

37:08.040 --> 37:11.010
- How many men?
- An army?

37:13.120 --> 37:15.566
- Good day to you.
- Good day, Sire.

37:16.400 --> 37:18.243
May it be a healthy birth

37:18.400 --> 37:20.482
may your dreams be full of wonder.

37:25.600 --> 37:26.647
Dreams?

37:27.480 --> 37:30.529
My mother told me that
before a man become a father

37:31.280 --> 37:32.964
he relives his own childhood.

37:38.720 --> 37:40.802
There are members of this court

37:40.960 --> 37:44.681
who are willing to sell details
of your life to the highest bidder

37:44.840 --> 37:48.447
giving no thought to the implications
for your safety.

37:49.600 --> 37:52.763
The Spaniards in your dungeon
were sure that their money

37:52.920 --> 37:55.366
would grant them access to your court.

37:55.840 --> 37:58.844
One of them gave me
the name of Mr Moncourt.

37:59.720 --> 38:03.406
These people you mention would
report our business to others.

38:04.840 --> 38:05.840
Undoubtedly.

38:07.000 --> 38:11.085
Regarding Moncourt,
do you wish me to act?

38:12.600 --> 38:13.600
No.

38:15.360 --> 38:19.046
Sire, they came knowing
there would be a friendly face,

38:19.480 --> 38:21.369
confident they'd meet someone...

38:21.520 --> 38:25.206
There will come a moment tonight
when Moncourt will wish to leave

38:26.120 --> 38:27.406
let him do so.

38:29.800 --> 38:31.370
People think us weak.

38:32.800 --> 38:34.245
Show them we're strong.

38:34.400 --> 38:37.404
Say it once, and all shall hear.

38:50.560 --> 38:52.722
<i>The Greeks knew what glory was</i>

38:54.640 --> 38:58.042
<i>their buildings were temples
for their gods.</i>

39:02.640 --> 39:04.324
<i>We will build a new temple.</i>

39:06.120 --> 39:08.202
A royal tabernacle of the Sun.

39:08.560 --> 39:11.484
A dwelling place of the divine
and of the people.

39:11.640 --> 39:14.803
With a great hall of light
that will follow the sunrise

39:14.960 --> 39:17.122
and shine to all corners of the globe

39:17.280 --> 39:20.443
so they might all see
the glory of France.

39:29.080 --> 39:30.969
A place of true wonder.

39:31.120 --> 39:34.886
To remind us of the great and ancient
past under our feet

39:35.040 --> 39:38.601
and from whose roots we all now grow.

39:39.600 --> 39:44.322
As a land and as a people, we know that
true power comes not only from our army

39:45.040 --> 39:47.691
but from the inner beauty
of our immortal soul.

39:47.840 --> 39:49.649
She will cherish us

39:50.640 --> 39:54.087
and as her children we will always
know her as our home.

39:55.840 --> 39:57.569
From all around the earth

39:58.000 --> 40:00.924
men will venture here
to look at her, those that do

40:01.440 --> 40:02.885
Will never leave.

40:03.880 --> 40:05.245
Will never forget.

40:06.640 --> 40:07.801
Fuck me!

41:55.560 --> 41:58.211
Father, please tell me a story.

41:58.680 --> 42:00.250
About the King.

42:03.040 --> 42:04.724
Which king would that be?

42:05.320 --> 42:06.924
You know which one.

42:08.680 --> 42:12.048
I will tell you a story of the king
and his palace.

42:29.960 --> 42:31.610
Once upon a time,

42:32.760 --> 42:35.445
there <i>was</i> a great and glorious King,

42:36.840 --> 42:39.161
who lived in a beautiful palace,

42:40.160 --> 42:41.844
in the middle of a forest.

42:43.720 --> 42:46.849
His first valet was an honest man,

42:48.160 --> 42:51.130
and he served the king
with all his heart.

42:52.000 --> 42:55.049
The position came to him by his father.

42:57.480 --> 42:59.403
Just <i>as</i> he will one day

43:00.480 --> 43:02.164
pass it on to you.

43:04.000 --> 43:06.128
I will work for the King?

43:07.040 --> 43:10.647
You will be the first man the king sees
in the morning,

43:12.520 --> 43:15.524
<i>and the lest he will see before bed.</i>

43:17.560 --> 43:20.450
<i>You will anticipate his every need,</i>

43:21.360 --> 43:24.011
<i>so he may continue on
his course of greatness.</i>

43:30.960 --> 43:33.361
<i>To see things no other man can see,</i>

43:33.520 --> 43:35.443
<i>and move towards them</i>

43:36.200 --> 43:39.090
<i>with singular courage and purpose.</i>

43:59.160 --> 44:02.607
<i>You will meet no other man so wise,</i>

44:03.880 --> 44:05.086
<i>so kind.</i>

44:05.600 --> 44:06.806
Nabo.

44:06.960 --> 44:08.849
<i>So generous.</i>

44:09.960 --> 44:11.530
You always cheer me up.

44:17.640 --> 44:20.291
<i>You will be the luckiest man
in the world.</i>

44:27.280 --> 44:28.770
<i>One of the few</i>

44:30.240 --> 44:32.129
<i>to truly know</i>

44:33.200 --> 44:35.441
<i>his most secret mind.</i>

44:38.000 --> 44:41.686
<i>You will live a life
you can only dream of.</i>

44:43.200 --> 44:46.522
<i>And be part of the most important family</i>

44:46.680 --> 44:49.081
<i>in the history of the world.</i>

44:54.120 --> 44:57.090
<i>And one day you will tell
your own son your journey</i>

44:59.120 --> 45:02.283
and pass these blessings on to him.

45:20.040 --> 45:21.565
Can I come and help you?

45:23.520 --> 45:25.045
I could use a midwife.

45:26.440 --> 45:30.081
And then one day,
I hope to be just like you.

45:30.240 --> 45:31.480
A woman doctor!

45:32.200 --> 45:33.440
There's an idea.

45:36.160 --> 45:37.650
Mother would be proud.

45:39.480 --> 45:40.480
Come and eat.

45:42.200 --> 45:44.521
Father! What good are you to the queen

45:44.680 --> 45:47.286
if you collapse from hunger
during the birth.

45:48.840 --> 45:51.605
You need your strength.
Respect your body.

45:52.720 --> 45:56.327
I respect the wishes of the king,
and he wishes me there.

45:57.360 --> 45:59.408
His power doesn't lie with the crown

45:59.960 --> 46:04.329
it lies with the one who holds
royal life in his hands, you father.

46:04.880 --> 46:07.167
The sooner you realize it, the better.

46:16.040 --> 46:18.042
- You think I was wrong?
- Don't.

46:19.240 --> 46:21.288
We pack our bags and leave now.

46:21.440 --> 46:24.091
Stop it father,
you're delivering a child.

46:24.240 --> 46:25.446
Not just any child.

46:31.600 --> 46:33.602
Sire, considering the surroundings,

46:33.760 --> 46:36.809
the best course of action
is to lay siege to it.

46:36.960 --> 46:40.123
If we are to be victorious
in the Spanish Netherlands

46:40.280 --> 46:43.841
we must claim our prize with both hands,
North and East.

46:44.000 --> 46:46.651
Two fronts working together,
here and here.

46:47.040 --> 46:49.247
Two fronts? We said the single column.

46:50.200 --> 46:53.522
Sire, you being so preoccupied
with other affairs

46:53.680 --> 46:55.603
we thought it best to...

46:56.960 --> 46:58.041
To what?

47:02.320 --> 47:03.320
Leave me.

47:12.200 --> 47:13.804
- So good of you to come.
- Pleasure.

47:15.520 --> 47:18.330
You spent 50,000 on shoes.

47:20.000 --> 47:23.288
Well, you haven't seen the shoes.

47:26.960 --> 47:29.201
When I asked if you had my back

47:29.760 --> 47:32.650
I meant that you would guard it,
not remove it.

47:33.360 --> 47:36.011
You build your palace,
I wear my clothes.

47:36.160 --> 47:38.288
As you say, perception is everything.

47:39.840 --> 47:41.080
But I tell you this,

47:42.000 --> 47:45.607
if you'd only let me go to war,
I would have your back and more.

47:47.040 --> 47:50.089
Besides my brother,
I would bring you such glory.

47:51.400 --> 47:53.243
What do you know of war?

47:56.280 --> 47:59.011
Exposing your flanks, very dangerous

47:59.160 --> 48:03.085
given the terrain I'd be careful about
thinning out the supply line.

48:04.160 --> 48:05.366
Take if from me,

48:05.520 --> 48:08.603
a well-timed thrust
might just split you in two.

48:10.320 --> 48:11.890
- Look, here.
- Stay your hand.

48:15.680 --> 48:17.250
I just want to show you.

48:17.880 --> 48:19.484
Put the piece back.

48:19.760 --> 48:21.046
It's so obvious.

48:21.600 --> 48:22.647
Give it to me.

48:25.160 --> 48:26.160
Come and get it.

48:27.120 --> 48:29.930
- Put it down.
- Too slow, mister.

48:30.880 --> 48:33.611
- Hand it over.
- I have your back.

48:33.760 --> 48:35.410
But what do I get? Respect?

48:36.160 --> 48:39.164
No. Power? No.

48:39.680 --> 48:41.444
You get money, to throw away.

48:41.600 --> 48:42.761
Now give it to me.

48:42.920 --> 48:45.207
You belittle me again!

48:47.200 --> 48:49.680
- Brother.
- The magic word, what is it?

48:50.720 --> 48:52.643
Do not forget who addresses you.

48:55.560 --> 48:56.560
Brother?

48:57.920 --> 49:00.002
We will not ask you again.

49:17.280 --> 49:19.044
You never were good at sharing.

49:35.640 --> 49:36.801
There she is.

49:40.480 --> 49:42.005
My beautiful wife.

49:51.520 --> 49:54.000
Do you think your brother
will like these?

49:55.440 --> 49:57.681
Bontemps asked me to watch the details.

50:13.680 --> 50:15.011
What do you want?

50:16.040 --> 50:17.326
I think I want a son,

50:18.080 --> 50:19.081
like my brother!

50:21.320 --> 50:23.641
<i>You can say what you like.</i>

50:26.040 --> 50:27.371
It won't to help you.

50:40.840 --> 50:42.683
Sire, the queen is at work.

51:28.160 --> 51:29.491
The moment is upon us

51:29.640 --> 51:32.723
so should events overtake us,
when the child is born,

51:32.880 --> 51:35.406
you will ask me the sex, as you recall,

51:36.120 --> 51:39.408
if it is a male child I will say
"I do not yet know, sire"

51:40.520 --> 51:43.524
if it is a girl child I will say
"I do not know, sire"

51:43.680 --> 51:46.490
this will give you a moment
to compose yourself.

51:47.080 --> 51:48.127
Should you wish.

51:56.160 --> 51:57.160
Breathe.

51:58.520 --> 51:59.521
Good!

52:00.840 --> 52:01.840
Keep breathing!

52:05.400 --> 52:06.400
Keep breathing.

52:11.520 --> 52:13.329
Your plans for war are not good.

52:14.320 --> 52:15.731
We cannot expose our flanks.

52:15.880 --> 52:18.770
There's too many people!
Too many people!

52:19.360 --> 52:20.646
Calm yourself, Majesty!

52:21.800 --> 52:25.168
Encircle them all, make for the Rhine,
then to the sea.

52:25.600 --> 52:28.080
- Bring me all of it.
- Sire, we cannot afford it.

52:28.240 --> 52:29.969
We cannot afford not to.

52:30.120 --> 52:31.281
- He's coming!
- Push now!

52:33.200 --> 52:34.406
Breathe!

52:36.600 --> 52:38.443
Push majesty, push!

52:39.360 --> 52:41.249
- Don't forget to breathe!
- I see the head!

52:41.880 --> 52:42.880
Push now!

52:44.560 --> 52:45.686
Yes, your Majesty!

52:50.400 --> 52:53.688
Sire, please! Everyone must leave!
At once!

52:55.600 --> 52:58.490
Everyone must leave, at once!

52:59.000 --> 53:00.809
It's the king's word.

53:12.840 --> 53:14.808
Well, what is the meaning of this?

53:17.680 --> 53:19.409
Doctor, what is the sex?

53:21.840 --> 53:23.569
Come man, speak!

53:25.840 --> 53:27.604
The problem is not the sex,

53:28.600 --> 53:31.729
it's her... color!
