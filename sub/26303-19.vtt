00:03.860 --> 00:04.988
Get you another?

00:05.828 --> 00:08.206
Um... no.

00:08.230 --> 00:10.141
That's okay. Thanks.

00:23.445 --> 00:24.923
Hey, Blair. It's me.

00:24.947 --> 00:26.991
I've called you a bunch of times.

00:27.015 --> 00:29.430
I've left you a bunch of
messages tried the office and...

00:30.556 --> 00:31.930
I'm gonna head home
'cause it's been a long day

00:31.954 --> 00:33.892
but if you could call me,
that would be...

00:34.556 --> 00:35.985
really great.

00:55.644 --> 00:57.789
Kev, I need you to do me a favor,

00:57.813 --> 00:59.958
and I want it off the books.

01:14.663 --> 01:17.832
Yeah, his car's here.

01:18.195 --> 01:20.463
I'm gonna try calling him again.
I'll call you back, Kev.

01:20.487 --> 01:21.980
Thanks.

01:24.873 --> 01:26.612
Blair?

02:05.247 --> 02:06.693
Blair!

02:07.883 --> 02:09.928
Hey! Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!

02:09.952 --> 02:11.729
Hey, hey! Stay with me, okay?

02:11.753 --> 02:14.032
Stay with me I'm... I'm calling 911.

02:14.056 --> 02:16.092
Blair, I need you to stay
with me, okay? Blair!

02:16.116 --> 02:17.468
Stay with me, stay with me.

02:17.492 --> 02:19.637
Just breathe, okay?
I'm right here. I'm right here.

02:19.661 --> 02:21.306
We're okay. We're okay.
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

02:21.330 --> 02:22.440
Hey, hey, hey!

Synced & corrected by -robtor-

02:29.838 --> 02:32.450
Burgess? Kim?

02:32.474 --> 02:34.385
- Kim! Kim, look at me.
- Yeah.

02:34.409 --> 02:36.621
They got him. His pulse is still steady.

02:36.645 --> 02:38.723
You did real good. What happened?

02:38.747 --> 02:40.625
I don't know.

02:40.649 --> 02:42.760
I saw his car, his cell phone rang,

02:42.784 --> 02:44.262
it brought me here.

02:44.286 --> 02:46.164
But I... I... it looks like
two small caliber rounds,

02:46.188 --> 02:47.732
but I didn't see any shell casings,

02:47.756 --> 02:49.467
- so I don't really know.
- Hey, Kim.

02:49.491 --> 02:51.169
You all right?

02:51.193 --> 02:53.338
By the time I got here, the
street was completely empty

02:53.362 --> 02:54.806
and his car was cold.

02:54.830 --> 02:56.975
So I say that we ping
his cell phone, right?

02:56.999 --> 02:58.576
- Hank.
- Because that will let us

02:58.600 --> 03:00.144
find out exactly what time he got here.

03:00.168 --> 03:01.913
- All right, we'll do that.
- Yeah.

03:01.937 --> 03:03.514
Come on. Come on.

03:03.538 --> 03:05.984
The victim's Kelton's consultant, Blair?

03:06.008 --> 03:08.186
Yeah, two GSWs being transported

03:08.210 --> 03:09.854
to Lakeshore Memorial.

03:09.878 --> 03:11.656
So what the hell was he doing out here?

03:11.680 --> 03:13.157
I don't have an answer to that yet.

03:13.181 --> 03:15.159
Well, the less you tell
the public, the better.

03:15.183 --> 03:16.260
Understood.

03:16.284 --> 03:19.097
Remember, my team's got
a connection to this kid.

03:19.121 --> 03:20.932
We got the same agenda on this.

03:20.956 --> 03:23.434
We find something ugly,
we're gonna keep it private.

03:23.458 --> 03:25.036
All right.

03:25.060 --> 03:27.105
Well, Kelton's on campaign
stops all this week...

03:27.129 --> 03:29.474
If I need you, I know where to find you.

03:29.498 --> 03:30.527
All right.

03:35.537 --> 03:37.838
- Kim all right?
- Yeah.

03:38.840 --> 03:40.551
Okay, I ran the address through NADIS.

03:40.575 --> 03:41.786
Pretty much what you'd expect.

03:41.810 --> 03:43.321
Area's known for trafficking.

03:43.345 --> 03:45.223
There's two houses on the
block that are both indexed.

03:45.247 --> 03:46.568
Known suppliers in each.

03:46.592 --> 03:48.659
All right, well we're gonna
have to run both.

03:48.683 --> 03:51.896
Question is anybody know if
Blair had a problem with drugs?

03:51.920 --> 03:55.052
No. He barely even drinks.

03:56.053 --> 03:58.859
Sarge, I got something.

04:01.596 --> 04:03.408
There's at least 20k in there.

04:03.432 --> 04:05.309
All small denominations.

04:07.669 --> 04:09.107
All right.

04:09.704 --> 04:11.716
Well, work your Cls.

04:11.740 --> 04:13.885
Reach out to Gangs, Narcotics,

04:13.909 --> 04:17.255
farm for witnesses, PODS.

04:17.279 --> 04:19.089
If they haven't been shot up,
we might get lucky.

04:19.113 --> 04:20.725
Yeah, I'm gonna head to the hospital.

04:20.749 --> 04:22.593
- Kim.
- Yeah?

04:22.617 --> 04:24.896
I just got talked to the hospital detail.

04:24.920 --> 04:28.001
Blair coded in the ambulance.
He died en route.

04:28.423 --> 04:29.934
I'm very sorry.

04:42.571 --> 04:44.515
- Hey.
- Hey. You okay?

04:44.539 --> 04:46.717
- Yeah.
- Okay.

04:46.741 --> 04:48.019
I talked to Platt and,

04:48.043 --> 04:49.520
Blair's family has been notified.

04:49.544 --> 04:51.622
They're hopping on planes
from Connecticut now.

04:51.646 --> 04:52.984
Okay.

04:53.548 --> 04:55.193
Did you, um, speak to Voight?

04:55.217 --> 04:57.695
He really running this as
a drug-related homicide?

04:57.719 --> 04:59.363
Yeah, for now.

04:59.387 --> 05:00.965
But we'll see where
the evidence takes us.

05:00.989 --> 05:02.467
Want me to give you a ride to the airport

05:02.491 --> 05:03.901
so you could meet the family
when they land?

05:03.925 --> 05:05.747
No, I cannot do that.

05:06.428 --> 05:08.959
I was meeting him last night to break up.

05:09.397 --> 05:12.376
So I was gonna tell him
not to move to Chicago.

05:12.400 --> 05:14.045
Not for me anyway.

05:14.069 --> 05:15.913
So I... I can't sit with his family, Kev.

05:15.937 --> 05:18.549
I don't belong there.
I don't belong there.

05:18.885 --> 05:20.585
No, I understand.

05:20.609 --> 05:22.253
So what do you want to do?

05:22.277 --> 05:23.432
I want to work.

05:24.933 --> 05:26.977
Copy that. Let's work.

05:31.586 --> 05:33.598
Blair Williams, 32 years old.

05:33.622 --> 05:37.101
Born and raised in Connecticut,
wealthy family.

05:37.125 --> 05:38.469
Studied politics at Princeton,

05:38.493 --> 05:41.072
moved to DC shortly after graduating.

05:41.096 --> 05:43.808
Spent his whole career
as a political consultant.

05:43.832 --> 05:45.409
Good reputation too.

05:45.433 --> 05:48.012
Been in Chicago the last
two months working for Kelton.

05:48.036 --> 05:50.915
Found last night, 1018 p.m., two GSWs.

05:50.939 --> 05:52.517
So far, nothing on forensics
or ballistics yet.

05:52.541 --> 05:54.585
Okay. Blair got any link to drugs?

05:54.609 --> 05:55.685
Any priors?

05:55.709 --> 05:56.921
Yeah, believe it or not,

05:56.945 --> 05:58.422
he got popped for possession at 17.

05:58.446 --> 06:00.191
He got pulled over on a traffic stop

06:00.215 --> 06:03.027
and the cops found seven grams
of cocaine on him.

06:03.051 --> 06:05.763
All right, so he didn't get
charged with intent to distribute?

06:05.787 --> 06:07.165
No.

06:07.189 --> 06:09.000
Apparently his parents
had pretty good lawyers.

06:09.024 --> 06:11.838
Ran through Blair's texts and calls.

06:11.862 --> 06:13.273
Um...

06:13.628 --> 06:15.973
mostly business, personal texts,

06:15.997 --> 06:18.009
but there is one that stands out
as being a little strange.

06:18.033 --> 06:19.877
It was a conversation
with a burner phone.

06:19.901 --> 06:21.879
Looks like Blair was trying
to buy something.

06:21.903 --> 06:24.048
Blair to the burner,
"Will give you a good price."

06:24.072 --> 06:25.516
The burner responds, "Meet me
8 p.m. The Green Lounge."

06:25.540 --> 06:26.784
Let me see.

06:26.808 --> 06:28.386
Sounds like a drug deal to me.

06:28.410 --> 06:30.988
Green Lounge, that's that bar
outside Englewood, right?

06:31.012 --> 06:33.191
Yeah. Lots of drugs, lots of fights.

06:33.215 --> 06:35.793
- Roll on it.
- You got it, Boss.

06:35.817 --> 06:37.506
- Kev?
- Yup.

06:38.353 --> 06:40.698
Kev, I'm going.

06:41.468 --> 06:42.990
Okay.

06:43.925 --> 06:45.636
We're not open for another two hours.

06:45.660 --> 06:47.538
We're not drinking.

06:50.665 --> 06:53.211
- Need to ask you a few questions.
- You can ask all you want

06:53.235 --> 06:55.246
but I make it a point not to
pay attention to our customers.

06:55.270 --> 06:57.048
- Is that so?
- Yeah.

06:57.072 --> 06:59.069
Makes it a hell of a lot easier
not to answer you.

06:59.574 --> 07:01.819
Hey, did you see him in here last night?

07:01.843 --> 07:04.755
Nah. Don't believe so.

07:04.779 --> 07:06.324
Yo! What the hell?

07:06.348 --> 07:08.826
My partner asked you
to look at a photo, so look.

07:08.850 --> 07:12.165
Otherwise I see broken glass.
That's a clear code violation.

07:13.088 --> 07:14.835
Give me the phone.

07:16.725 --> 07:19.337
Yeah, he was here last night.

07:19.361 --> 07:21.038
Spent about half hour at the bar.

07:21.062 --> 07:22.340
Who was he with?

07:22.364 --> 07:24.275
Some black dude I've never seen before.

07:24.299 --> 07:26.844
They came in, had a drink, talked, left.

07:26.868 --> 07:29.013
- Good enough?
- No.

07:29.037 --> 07:30.348
Did you hear what
they were talking about?

07:30.372 --> 07:31.415
Did you hear a name?

07:31.439 --> 07:33.851
Do you have a better description
than "black dude"?

07:33.875 --> 07:35.686
They were talking about money.

07:35.710 --> 07:38.222
If you want my opinion, it's
exactly what it looked like.

07:38.246 --> 07:39.857
Rich prick comes to the hood

07:39.881 --> 07:42.016
to slum out on some Englewood coke.

07:43.285 --> 07:47.054
- Do you have security cameras?
- Do you see any cameras?

07:50.058 --> 07:52.303
That exit go out to the parking lot?

07:52.327 --> 07:53.707
Yeah.

08:01.469 --> 08:04.238
- You okay?
- Fine. I'm fine.

08:05.140 --> 08:06.951
Look, I know you didn't
know him for very long,

08:06.975 --> 08:08.986
but I know you,
I know you feel things deeply.

08:09.010 --> 08:10.945
That's how it was with us anyway.

08:13.415 --> 08:17.230
I'm just trying to tell you, if
you need somebody to lean on...

08:18.086 --> 08:20.097
you know, I got your back.

08:28.930 --> 08:31.494
If he left out the back,
that camera might've caught him.

08:32.133 --> 08:35.011
- There.
- Is that Blair?

08:35.373 --> 08:37.250
The clothes are a match.

08:41.943 --> 08:43.029
- Got him.
- Yeah.

08:43.053 --> 08:44.588
Blue Buick.

08:44.612 --> 08:47.458
Plate is John 774089.

08:49.617 --> 08:50.961
Well, that's different.

08:50.985 --> 08:52.763
Car's registered to First City Fellowship

08:52.787 --> 08:54.532
in Englewood.

08:54.556 --> 08:56.065
That's a church.

09:01.796 --> 09:04.542
Jay. Blue Buick.

09:04.566 --> 09:06.811
What is Blair doing
hanging out with a Reverend

09:06.835 --> 09:08.713
at a bar known for rocks and blows?

09:08.737 --> 09:09.908
Yeah.

09:12.073 --> 09:13.870
Reverend Dennis?

09:20.482 --> 09:23.127
Reverend Dennis, Chicago PD.

09:26.421 --> 09:28.422
Body.

09:33.061 --> 09:34.672
5021 Henry.

09:34.696 --> 09:36.674
Male victim, GSW to the hip,
GSW to the neck.

09:36.698 --> 09:40.144
Roll an ambo to 4329 South 51st Street.

09:40.168 --> 09:43.481
Reverend? Dennis? Dennis, can you talk?

09:43.505 --> 09:45.483
Who shot you?

09:45.507 --> 09:48.586
Help's on the way, okay?
Stay with us. Stay with us.

09:59.038 --> 10:01.182
I think he was bleeding out for a while.

10:01.206 --> 10:02.653
There's no witnesses, no phone.

10:02.677 --> 10:04.264
The shooter probably snatched it.

10:04.725 --> 10:06.536
Looks like Dennis might have
known the shooter.

10:06.560 --> 10:08.438
He was in the back making tea
when it happened.

10:08.462 --> 10:10.840
- No signs of a struggle.
- Yeah, there were four casings

10:10.864 --> 10:13.042
which means the shooter missed
twice at close range.

10:13.066 --> 10:14.077
So he was not a professional.

10:14.101 --> 10:16.245
Hey, this guy Dennis?

10:16.269 --> 10:18.281
Are we sure that
he's a legitimate reverend?

10:18.305 --> 10:19.515
Yeah, he was ordained.

10:19.539 --> 10:21.017
Well, Blair wasn't religious.

10:21.041 --> 10:23.619
So I have no idea why
he was meeting with a reverend.

10:23.643 --> 10:25.688
Ballistics came back as a match.

10:25.712 --> 10:28.714
9mm that killed Blair killed Dennis too.

10:30.050 --> 10:31.489
Okay.

10:31.885 --> 10:33.429
Maybe he's a political donor.

10:33.453 --> 10:35.565
They were meeting to maybe talk
about the election.

10:35.589 --> 10:37.100
I ran that theory up the ladder.

10:37.124 --> 10:38.542
- Yeah?
- No one from Kelton's staff

10:38.566 --> 10:39.702
recognized the name.

10:39.726 --> 10:41.270
Did they know if Blair had any enemies?

10:41.294 --> 10:43.206
None that stood out as anything more

10:43.230 --> 10:44.607
than political divides.

10:44.631 --> 10:46.743
I mean, all they said
was Kelton is really pissed

10:46.767 --> 10:48.377
that he's way behind in the polls,

10:48.401 --> 10:51.748
that everyone was
pretty much drowning in it.

10:51.772 --> 10:53.282
Except for Blair.

10:53.306 --> 10:55.251
He had been talking about
a new opportunity he had,

10:55.275 --> 10:56.819
but no one knew what he meant by that.

10:56.843 --> 10:58.955
Guys, listen to this

10:58.979 --> 11:00.289
If this brother's a man of God now,

11:00.313 --> 11:01.924
that was not always the case.

11:01.948 --> 11:03.092
He's got three drug charges.

11:03.116 --> 11:04.460
Dennis Reed,

11:04.484 --> 11:06.062
spent a decade of his life running drugs

11:06.086 --> 11:08.431
for the G Park Lords before
he found the church.

11:08.455 --> 11:09.665
Well, well, well.

11:09.689 --> 11:11.167
Maybe it was never a full turn.

11:11.191 --> 11:13.136
Just faith as a front.

11:13.160 --> 11:14.670
Church is a good place to funnel money.

11:14.694 --> 11:17.140
He's still dealing,
he meets Blair somehow,

11:17.164 --> 11:19.220
they see a chance to make some money,

11:19.244 --> 11:21.344
do some business, a new opportunity.

11:21.368 --> 11:22.745
Then someone swoops in,

11:22.769 --> 11:24.447
kills them both to end the sale.

11:24.471 --> 11:26.182
All right, let's just take it
step by step.

11:26.206 --> 11:29.152
First let's confirm that Dennis
was still actually dealing.

11:29.176 --> 11:30.820
And search Blair's hotel.

11:30.844 --> 11:32.822
I mean, if these two were
moving heavy product together,

11:32.846 --> 11:35.678
they were wearing damn
good masks for the world.

11:36.602 --> 11:38.670
Let's peel 'em back.

11:41.488 --> 11:44.100
Hey, Burgess, Dawson?

11:44.124 --> 11:46.602
This is Maya Williams, Blair's sister.

11:46.626 --> 11:48.828
She was hoping
to get an update on the case.

11:49.629 --> 11:51.340
Hi. I just landed and I came here

11:51.364 --> 11:53.109
'cause I was hoping to get some answers.

11:53.133 --> 11:55.178
Something? Anything?

11:55.202 --> 11:56.612
Hey, you know what?

11:56.636 --> 11:57.880
Why don't we go talk over here?

11:57.904 --> 11:59.079
No, I got this one.

11:59.103 --> 12:00.983
You get the boxes.
I'll meet you in the car?

12:01.007 --> 12:02.007
Okay, sure.

12:02.709 --> 12:03.832
Okay.

12:07.877 --> 12:09.892
So are there any official suspects yet?

12:09.916 --> 12:12.528
- Yeah, we have a few leads.
- Okay.

12:12.552 --> 12:16.699
Okay. Um, Maya?

12:19.492 --> 12:22.371
Did your brother have
an issue with drugs?

12:22.395 --> 12:24.310
Using or dealing or...

12:26.166 --> 12:28.744
You're asking me that because
of his arrest in high school.

12:28.768 --> 12:29.931
The coke.

12:29.955 --> 12:32.381
I am, but he was also found in an area

12:32.405 --> 12:34.654
known for drug trafficking, so...

12:35.408 --> 12:37.866
You know, our family's
always been a little, um...

12:39.325 --> 12:41.057
complicated.

12:44.784 --> 12:47.430
So the night that Blair got arrested.

12:47.454 --> 12:49.002
My father was with him.

12:51.091 --> 12:52.958
The drugs were his.

12:54.127 --> 12:56.362
My father's an addict.

12:57.430 --> 12:59.208
Blair took the rap?

12:59.232 --> 13:00.376
Yeah.

13:00.400 --> 13:02.807
It's just what we did, you know?

13:03.236 --> 13:07.250
We all covered for my father's illness.

13:11.077 --> 13:13.089
His intentions were good.

13:20.487 --> 13:22.231
- Go ahead.
- Thank you.

14:03.997 --> 14:06.204
- Kim.
- Yeah.

14:10.170 --> 14:12.989
Found it in the nightstand.
It's got your name on it.

14:13.013 --> 14:14.671
I thought you might wanna open it.

14:34.227 --> 14:35.638
- Sarge.
- Anything?

14:35.662 --> 14:37.306
Nah, no drugs, no cash. Found a laptop.

14:37.330 --> 14:39.308
Let me take it to CPIC now,
see if they can get into it.

14:39.332 --> 14:40.609
- Great.
- Files, documents, binders.

14:40.633 --> 14:42.278
Lots more in the car. Mostly on Price.

14:42.302 --> 14:43.813
Some on his daughter, Jasmine.

14:43.837 --> 14:46.115
Probably looking into her
to find dirt on Ray.

14:46.139 --> 14:47.350
Looking for a weak spot.

14:47.374 --> 14:48.484
Right.

14:48.508 --> 14:50.353
- Boss.
- Yeah.

14:50.377 --> 14:51.988
I think I got something on Dennis.

14:52.012 --> 14:53.856
A few members from his church
were worried

14:53.880 --> 14:56.212
he had one foot in, one foot out.

14:56.716 --> 14:58.561
His one foot out is this girl right here.

14:58.585 --> 14:59.895
Kasey Hartman?

14:59.919 --> 15:01.964
Yeah, she's known him
since his glory days

15:01.988 --> 15:02.988
with the G Parks.

15:03.012 --> 15:04.133
They stay in heavy contact,

15:04.157 --> 15:06.702
only she's not so clean,
she's not so holy.

15:06.726 --> 15:10.429
I'm thinking she could tell us
who the real Dennis is.

15:11.630 --> 15:12.963
You and me.

15:15.902 --> 15:18.381
No one thought to come
to me when he was found.

15:18.405 --> 15:20.049
I hear it from those church people

15:20.073 --> 15:22.084
and now you finally come
and you just want to know

15:22.108 --> 15:23.384
if he was dealing?

15:23.408 --> 15:25.488
What, since he was screwing me
he had to be?

15:25.512 --> 15:27.156
I don't think that.

15:27.180 --> 15:28.953
I think you knew him and...

15:29.449 --> 15:31.360
I think that means you
might be able to help us.

15:31.384 --> 15:32.895
Well, I don't know what he was up to

15:32.919 --> 15:35.220
and I don't know anyone
named Blair Williams.

15:35.955 --> 15:38.000
Well, Kasey, we're just trying to help.

15:38.024 --> 15:41.727
So anything you could think of
would be a big help to us.

15:42.629 --> 15:44.407
It's probably nothing.

15:44.431 --> 15:47.472
You know, a lot of times it's
the nothing that helps us most.

15:48.768 --> 15:50.846
I met him for dinner
a couple of days ago.

15:50.870 --> 15:53.449
He was late. He's never late.

15:53.473 --> 15:55.384
20 minutes after we were
supposed to meet,

15:55.408 --> 15:57.086
a silver Escalade drops him off.

15:57.110 --> 15:59.422
He was upset. Wouldn't say who it was.

15:59.446 --> 16:02.358
I thought maybe... maybe he fell off.

16:02.382 --> 16:04.260
Okay, you said silver Escalade.

16:04.284 --> 16:05.628
Did you see who was inside?

16:05.652 --> 16:07.730
Nah, the windows were tinted.

16:08.117 --> 16:09.765
But it was some kind of official car.

16:09.789 --> 16:12.935
Had a... a placard and a slogan sticker.

16:12.959 --> 16:16.072
Future... Future Chicago.
Something like that

16:28.975 --> 16:30.119
Hank.

16:30.143 --> 16:32.655
Hey, Alicia. Is your husband...

16:32.679 --> 16:34.256
Hey, baby, I told you I had the door...

16:34.280 --> 16:35.558
Hank.

16:37.984 --> 16:39.628
What's going on?

16:39.652 --> 16:42.187
You tell me, Ray.

16:51.922 --> 16:54.232
Special Reserve. You want a glass?

16:54.256 --> 16:56.291
No thanks. I'm on duty.

16:57.026 --> 17:00.105
So I'll give you a short pour.

17:00.129 --> 17:02.107
So what's going on, Hank?

17:02.131 --> 17:03.942
Reverend Dennis Reed.

17:04.424 --> 17:06.944
- What about him?
- How do you know him?

17:07.300 --> 17:10.405
Well, he's lived in my ward all his life.

17:11.140 --> 17:13.452
When's the last time you saw him?

17:13.476 --> 17:16.988
Hank, the questions, the tone.

17:17.012 --> 17:19.090
Just tell me what the hell is going on.

17:19.439 --> 17:21.960
When's the last time
you talked to him, Ray?

17:21.983 --> 17:23.795
A few days ago.

17:23.819 --> 17:26.298
And what did you and
the good reverend discuss?

17:26.321 --> 17:29.468
"The good reverend"?

17:29.492 --> 17:30.959
Come on, man.

17:32.118 --> 17:35.878
Dennis Reed is a cold coke-slinging punk.

17:35.902 --> 17:37.309
- That right?
- Yeah.

17:37.333 --> 17:39.144
This reverend thing is just a joke.

17:40.803 --> 17:44.449
Well, word was that he was
selling product again.

17:44.735 --> 17:46.880
On his own.

17:46.904 --> 17:50.150
So I went to him and said, "Back off."

17:50.636 --> 17:52.786
And, you know, find some
new hustle or something

17:52.810 --> 17:54.755
that wasn't gonna get him killed.

17:54.779 --> 17:56.556
It's three weeks away from the election.

17:56.580 --> 18:00.183
I don't need any more bodies
being dropped in my ward.

18:01.825 --> 18:04.727
Well, it looks like Dennis
didn't heed your advice.

18:05.856 --> 18:08.168
He was found dead in his church.

18:08.192 --> 18:09.503
Shot twice.

18:09.527 --> 18:10.990
Son of a bitch.

18:11.629 --> 18:14.202
He couldn't stay out of his own damn way?

18:15.032 --> 18:17.444
Any idea who might've pulled the trigger?

18:18.803 --> 18:21.281
Well, if he was really, dealing.

18:21.305 --> 18:24.240
I'm guessing the local
shot-caller took him out.

18:24.975 --> 18:26.881
Guy by the name of Nate Lewis.

18:28.512 --> 18:31.124
Straight up, cold-blooded gangster.

18:33.150 --> 18:35.529
He's been selling blow
and killing young black men

18:35.553 --> 18:37.264
for the last ten years.

18:38.956 --> 18:43.336
If I was a betting man,
he's your shooter.

18:46.564 --> 18:47.974
Chicago PD!

18:52.069 --> 18:54.147
Nate Lewis, open the door!

18:54.171 --> 18:56.149
Okay, okay. You can stop
with all the yelling, man.

18:56.173 --> 18:58.149
- What the hell is this about?
- Sir, we just want to talk.

18:58.173 --> 18:59.964
- You got a warrant?
- No.

18:59.988 --> 19:02.137
Then y'all can keep stepping.
I don't talk to the police.

19:02.161 --> 19:03.824
Well, you know, sometimes
talking is a lot easier

19:03.848 --> 19:04.991
than not talking.

19:05.015 --> 19:06.540
- Threatening me?
- Of course not.

19:06.564 --> 19:08.061
I'm just saying,
if you answer a few questions,

19:08.085 --> 19:09.266
you'll save us a lot of time...

19:09.290 --> 19:11.234
What he's really saying,
Nate, is either we talk now

19:11.258 --> 19:13.124
or we come back in the middle
of the night with a warrant

19:13.148 --> 19:15.869
- and we toss your house and car.
- Man, y'all can kiss my ass.

19:15.893 --> 19:17.859
I see drugs on the table in plain view.

19:17.883 --> 19:19.688
Get against the wall! Against the wall!

19:19.712 --> 19:21.244
Man, I got no drugs out here.
I'm not an idiot, man!

19:21.268 --> 19:22.955
- You know Blair Williams?
- No, never heard of him.

19:22.979 --> 19:24.321
Turn around, put your hands on the wall.

19:24.345 --> 19:25.463
- Man, what the hell, man?
- Yo, yo, yo.

19:25.487 --> 19:26.563
I need you to not step up on me.

19:26.587 --> 19:27.733
Turn around and put your hands
on the wall.

19:27.757 --> 19:28.791
- Resisting arrest?
- No!

19:28.815 --> 19:31.228
That's enough to charge you. Sit down.
I want you to sit down.

19:31.252 --> 19:33.057
Hands up, man. Hands up. Sit down.

19:33.081 --> 19:34.187
Clear.

19:42.286 --> 19:43.499
Ruze.

19:45.422 --> 19:46.733
Lucky.

19:48.692 --> 19:50.737
We got a positive.

19:53.197 --> 19:54.875
Antonio, we're checking the garage now.

19:54.899 --> 19:56.376
Copy that.

20:20.558 --> 20:22.235
Gun.

20:27.998 --> 20:30.066
9mm.

20:31.902 --> 20:33.413
Like I keep saying,

20:33.437 --> 20:35.303
I don't know nothing about
those murders or no damn gun.

20:35.327 --> 20:36.560
Yeah, the problem is, bro,

20:36.584 --> 20:38.575
that damn gun is the damn murder weapon

20:38.599 --> 20:40.287
of Dennis Reed and Blair Williams.

20:40.311 --> 20:42.455
Blair Williams?
I... I never met that dude!

20:42.479 --> 20:44.291
Nate, I don't care if you never met him

20:44.315 --> 20:46.126
or you knew him
or you went camping together.

20:46.150 --> 20:47.594
What matters is, you killed him.

20:47.618 --> 20:49.462
I don't know who
or what you're talking about.

20:49.486 --> 20:50.635
But you did know Dennis?

20:50.659 --> 20:51.919
Sure, I've known him for years.

20:51.943 --> 20:54.113
And you got angry because
he started dealing again

20:54.137 --> 20:55.710
- in your territory.
- No, no, no, no.

20:55.734 --> 20:57.812
I got upset because he started
shaking my ass down

20:57.813 --> 20:59.390
- for donations to his church.
- Come on, Nate. Nate, Nate!

20:59.414 --> 21:00.658
I never talked to him about drugs!

21:00.682 --> 21:02.160
Listen to me.

21:02.184 --> 21:04.596
We got the murder weapon
and we got motive.

21:04.620 --> 21:06.731
You wanted to end the sale.

21:06.755 --> 21:08.166
With your resume,

21:08.190 --> 21:09.934
that's enough to put you away for life.

21:09.958 --> 21:11.169
You understand?

21:11.193 --> 21:13.839
So we're trying to do you a favor.

21:15.132 --> 21:16.774
Now give us your version of the story,

21:16.798 --> 21:19.934
the ASA will take that
into consideration.

21:21.103 --> 21:22.780
Man, I'm done talking.

21:22.804 --> 21:24.305
Lawyer.

21:25.518 --> 21:28.119
Lawyer or no lawyer,
we got enough to charge him.

21:29.978 --> 21:32.290
Hey, Kim, look, I know
it's not a perfect result,

21:32.314 --> 21:34.026
but at least it's something.

21:35.486 --> 21:37.662
Yeah, I guess.

21:55.648 --> 21:58.273
_

22:03.973 --> 22:05.857
I'm not a damn china doll, Adam.

22:06.267 --> 22:08.015
You don't have to keep checking on me.

22:11.026 --> 22:12.660
Talk to me.

22:14.082 --> 22:16.250
Just talk to me.

22:25.536 --> 22:29.881
Blair wanted to stay in Chicago,

22:30.332 --> 22:31.516
but I was gonna tell him to leave.

22:31.540 --> 22:34.385
That, you know, I didn't see us
together long-term.

22:38.174 --> 22:40.176
I should've told him to stay.

22:41.218 --> 22:42.344
Yeah.

22:43.429 --> 22:45.663
I should've told him
I was falling in love with him.

22:50.561 --> 22:53.338
He was a good person.
He was an honest person.

22:53.731 --> 22:56.608
There's no way in hell that
he was looking into a drug deal

22:57.026 --> 22:59.320
with a half-assed reverend named Dennis.

23:00.068 --> 23:01.614
No way.

23:02.615 --> 23:04.282
This whole case doesn't make any sense.

23:04.306 --> 23:06.117
It doesn't.

23:06.494 --> 23:08.746
No one believes me, but it doesn't.

23:09.872 --> 23:11.389
I believe you.

23:14.418 --> 23:16.394
I believe you and if you tell
Voight what you just told me,

23:16.418 --> 23:18.085
he's gonna believe you too.

23:20.382 --> 23:21.464
Thank you.

23:30.072 --> 23:33.601
I'm sorry, Kim. You know?

23:38.192 --> 23:40.041
I'm sorry.

23:51.976 --> 23:53.707
I know that I was, um...

23:56.101 --> 23:57.646
That Blair and I
were sleeping together. Guy on?

23:57.670 --> 24:00.215
That I liked him a lot.

24:00.239 --> 24:01.673
I'm close to this.

24:03.609 --> 24:06.011
I'm still rational, I'm still a cop,

24:06.445 --> 24:08.390
and I know who he was and who he wasn't.

24:08.414 --> 24:10.454
And he wasn't a drug dealer or a user.

24:10.478 --> 24:11.559
Kim,

24:12.017 --> 24:13.261
we don't have clean evidence

24:13.285 --> 24:14.763
any of this is linked to politics.

24:14.787 --> 24:17.399
We do have evidence...
credible evidence...

24:17.423 --> 24:18.867
that it's linked to drugs.

24:18.891 --> 24:20.484
Then the evidence is lying.

24:20.893 --> 24:23.552
The premise, Nate Lewis,
something's wrong here.

24:23.576 --> 24:25.155
I know that.

24:25.798 --> 24:28.443
I want 48 hours before you charge Nate.

24:28.467 --> 24:29.886
If I'm wrong about Blair, then I'm wrong,

24:29.910 --> 24:31.453
but let me be sure of it.

24:38.744 --> 24:40.789
I know what this case looks like,

24:40.813 --> 24:42.924
but it's not about drugs.

24:42.948 --> 24:45.301
Blair's vice was politics.

24:45.751 --> 24:47.796
He won every campaign
that he ever worked on

24:47.820 --> 24:49.464
and he was gonna win this one too.

24:49.488 --> 24:51.132
He played hard, probably dirty.

24:51.156 --> 24:53.735
Now I'm thinking that the 20k
that we found in his trunk

24:53.759 --> 24:55.672
probably had to do with
something political.

24:55.696 --> 24:57.668
Yeah, so the question is,

24:57.669 --> 24:59.914
what could Dennis know
or have in his possession

24:59.938 --> 25:01.583
that was worth 20k to Blair?

25:01.607 --> 25:03.184
Probably something to do with Price.

25:03.208 --> 25:05.019
Kim, I'm not trying to go
against you here,

25:05.043 --> 25:06.221
but we dug into Dennis.

25:06.245 --> 25:07.422
We know he and Price knew each other.

25:07.446 --> 25:09.057
But we didn't find any questionable

25:09.081 --> 25:10.725
or illicit connections between them.

25:10.749 --> 25:12.727
We ran Dennis through
Kelton's background,

25:12.751 --> 25:14.896
his campaign through Price's.

25:14.920 --> 25:16.790
Nothing hit.

25:20.692 --> 25:23.204
Jasmine Price.

25:23.228 --> 25:24.939
What about his daughter, Jasmine?

25:24.963 --> 25:28.209
Blair was looking into her.
He did a full background check.

25:28.233 --> 25:30.044
All right, Blair was digging
into Jasmine.

25:30.068 --> 25:32.046
Why don't we do some digging of our own?

25:32.070 --> 25:33.891
See if there's anything real there.

25:35.607 --> 25:38.520
Are you Vanessa?
Can we talk to you for a sec?

25:38.544 --> 25:40.555
- About what?
- About Jasmine Price.

25:40.856 --> 25:42.290
Is this about her father becoming mayor?

25:42.314 --> 25:43.458
'Cause I never even met him.

25:43.482 --> 25:45.794
We're not reporters. We're cops.

25:45.818 --> 25:48.062
Sorry. Sure.

25:48.086 --> 25:49.297
Yeah, we can talk.

25:49.321 --> 25:50.588
- Can you cover me?
- Yeah.

25:55.287 --> 25:57.806
So you and Jasmine, you were roommates?

25:57.830 --> 25:59.207
Yeah, for two years,

25:59.231 --> 26:01.442
but we were never
best friends or anything.

26:01.466 --> 26:03.278
We ran in different crowds.

26:03.302 --> 26:05.046
Just sort of stayed out
of each other's way, you know?

26:05.070 --> 26:06.648
Until she left school for a bit.

26:06.672 --> 26:08.883
- Why? What's this about?
- Why did she leave school?

26:08.907 --> 26:10.151
I'm not really sure.

26:10.175 --> 26:11.986
She just never came back
after fall break.

26:12.010 --> 26:13.721
She kind of just disappeared..

26:13.745 --> 26:16.124
I said the same thing to that
other guy about a week ago.

26:16.148 --> 26:17.559
What other guy?

26:17.583 --> 26:18.993
I'm sorry, I forgot his name.

26:19.017 --> 26:20.376
What did he look like?

26:20.400 --> 26:22.063
He was about your age.

26:22.087 --> 26:24.232
Black, Asian. Dressed really nice.

26:24.256 --> 26:26.601
- Blair.
- Yeah, that's it. Blair.

26:26.625 --> 26:28.670
He had a lot of questions
about Jasmine too.

26:28.694 --> 26:30.104
What kind of questions?

26:30.128 --> 26:31.306
He wanted to know about some guy

26:31.330 --> 26:33.007
she was dating from the city

26:33.031 --> 26:34.275
before she took a leave of absence.

26:34.299 --> 26:35.844
I didn't remember his name.

26:35.868 --> 26:39.314
I'd only met him a few times
and he was kind of scary.

26:39.338 --> 26:41.316
- A little wild and...
- This him?

26:41.709 --> 26:43.544
Yeah, that's the guy.

26:44.443 --> 26:45.754
Thank you.

26:47.145 --> 26:48.632
I'll call Voight.

26:49.181 --> 26:51.359
So I understand you knew Dennis Reed.

26:51.383 --> 26:53.194
Yes, I knew Dennis.

26:53.218 --> 26:55.597
We sort of hung out for a few months.

26:55.621 --> 26:58.533
It's fair to say
it wasn't Jasmine's finest hour.

26:58.557 --> 27:00.368
- That's fair.
- Okay.

27:00.392 --> 27:03.037
We met at a party in the neighborhood

27:03.061 --> 27:05.273
and we started dating.

27:05.297 --> 27:07.342
And she started drinking

27:07.366 --> 27:10.144
and partying, got lost.

27:10.168 --> 27:12.313
So we pulled her out of school
for a semester

27:12.337 --> 27:14.048
so she could get her head on straight.

27:14.072 --> 27:16.493
And now?

27:17.009 --> 27:18.486
She's on track to graduate.

27:18.510 --> 27:19.954
- With honors.
- Wow.

27:19.978 --> 27:21.623
Just got accepted to Columbia Law School.

27:21.647 --> 27:25.360
Good for you. That's a hell of a thing.

27:25.384 --> 27:26.995
Thank you, sir.

27:27.019 --> 27:28.547
Let me ask you,

27:29.087 --> 27:31.467
when was the last time
you talked to Dennis?

27:32.090 --> 27:35.236
It's been a while.

27:35.260 --> 27:37.805
- About a year?
- Okay.

27:37.829 --> 27:41.743
When you two were together,
anything unusual happen?

27:41.767 --> 27:43.311
Unusual?

27:43.729 --> 27:45.847
Something you might not want
the world to find out about.

27:45.871 --> 27:47.888
Hank, what the hell
kind of question is...

27:47.912 --> 27:50.027
Ray, I'm trying to be respectful.

27:50.943 --> 27:52.720
I got two dead bodies.

27:52.744 --> 27:54.722
One of the dead guys was in your car

27:54.746 --> 27:58.160
the day before he died
and he dated your daughter.

27:58.951 --> 28:00.162
Okay.

28:01.219 --> 28:04.365
Other than partying, no.

28:04.389 --> 28:07.892
Nothing unusual or shameful.

28:11.196 --> 28:12.549
Okay.

28:13.031 --> 28:14.575
All right, then?

28:14.599 --> 28:16.010
If you don't need anything else,

28:16.034 --> 28:18.046
Jasmine needs to get back to work.

28:18.070 --> 28:20.014
- Bye, baby.
- See you, Daddy.

28:20.038 --> 28:21.850
- Appreciate it.
- Thank you.

28:23.542 --> 28:25.219
Man, she seems like a good kid.

28:25.243 --> 28:27.922
Yeah, she is. I'm very proud.

28:27.946 --> 28:29.457
You should be.

28:29.481 --> 28:32.860
Ray, why didn't you tell me
Jasmine and Dennis had dated?

28:33.144 --> 28:34.822
I was embarrassed.

28:36.788 --> 28:39.300
I did everything I could
to raise her right,

28:39.324 --> 28:40.802
get her into a good college.

28:40.826 --> 28:42.996
And then she starts dating some punk?

28:43.789 --> 28:45.440
Made me crazy.

28:45.749 --> 28:47.876
I tried to block it out.

28:48.600 --> 28:51.463
Just pretend it didn't happen.

28:55.007 --> 28:57.386
- We good, right?
- Yeah.

29:01.646 --> 29:03.925
Three more weeks, I'll be mayor.

29:04.950 --> 29:06.427
Hell of a thing.

29:06.451 --> 29:10.164
Me and you, we're gonna do
some great things together.

29:14.459 --> 29:16.437
- You talked to Jasmine?
- I did.

29:16.461 --> 29:17.805
She admit to dating Dennis?

29:17.829 --> 29:19.607
Yeah, they dated a few months.

29:19.631 --> 29:21.609
Partied more than they should have,

29:21.633 --> 29:23.954
but according to her, that's about it.

29:24.603 --> 29:26.873
So we still don't know what
Blair had on Jasmine or Ray

29:26.897 --> 29:28.082
that was so valuable.

29:28.106 --> 29:29.517
If Blair found something,

29:29.541 --> 29:31.185
he found it doing
opposition research, right?

29:31.209 --> 29:32.854
- Yeah.
- Let's do the same.

29:32.878 --> 29:35.478
Just focus on the two, three
months Jasmine dated Dennis.

29:35.502 --> 29:38.426
But listen, we soft-shoe this, okay.

29:38.450 --> 29:40.762
Anybody asks, it's just for background.

29:40.786 --> 29:42.797
None of this goes in the report yet.

29:43.822 --> 29:45.433
Let's go.

29:45.457 --> 29:47.301
Guys, September's a bust.

29:47.325 --> 29:48.469
Let's move onto October.

29:48.493 --> 29:49.837
October in a college town.

29:49.861 --> 29:52.206
Gonna be a hell of a lot
of police reports.

29:52.230 --> 29:55.510
All right, Evanston, October 2016.

29:55.534 --> 29:58.946
We got DUls, disorderly conduct,
drug possession.

29:58.970 --> 30:00.782
Nothing connected to Jasmine or Dennis.

30:00.806 --> 30:02.889
Well, maybe she got picked up,
a cop knew who she was?

30:02.913 --> 30:04.018
Well, if that's the case,

30:04.042 --> 30:06.054
not a whole lot Blair can do
without an official record.

30:06.078 --> 30:08.122
She may have not been picked
up, but she was partying.

30:08.146 --> 30:10.558
She deleted her social media
for all of October.

30:10.582 --> 30:11.859
But her iCloud? Look at this.

30:11.883 --> 30:13.561
She looks like a different person.

30:13.585 --> 30:15.296
See, his iCloud,
everything that doesn't match

30:15.320 --> 30:17.732
his reverend rebrand
got moved or deleted.

30:17.756 --> 30:21.169
- Why not delete everything?
- That I do not know.

30:21.193 --> 30:23.037
Wait. Wait, who is that?

30:23.061 --> 30:24.922
Do facial rec on her because I
recognize her

30:24.946 --> 30:26.974
- from these photos.
- Sending.

30:30.102 --> 30:32.580
Got it. Anna Welk.

30:32.604 --> 30:34.515
One prior for possession,

30:34.539 --> 30:37.218
deceased, October 17, 2016,

30:37.242 --> 30:38.252
cocaine overdose.

30:38.276 --> 30:39.821
Yeah, I got an EMT report.

30:39.845 --> 30:42.156
Paramedics respond
to a home in Evanston

30:42.180 --> 30:43.658
on the morning of October 17th.

30:43.682 --> 30:45.927
Patient Anna Welk
pronounced dead on arrival.

30:45.951 --> 30:48.930
I think I got something.
I need a jump drive.

30:48.954 --> 30:50.164
We got to get this to Voight right away.

30:50.188 --> 30:51.375
Here.

30:53.252 --> 30:55.103
Hey, yo, yo, yo!

30:55.127 --> 30:57.984
Jasmine Price, the badass
bitch of Beverly.

30:58.008 --> 30:59.907
- Hi!
- Selling, taking names!

31:01.133 --> 31:04.212
We gonna be rich! Cash money!

31:04.236 --> 31:06.747
All I gotta do is keep
selling to my girl, Anna.

31:06.771 --> 31:08.716
Hey, come here, babe. Come here.

31:08.740 --> 31:11.419
Get over here.

31:11.443 --> 31:13.221
Let me get some more vodka, boo.

31:15.046 --> 31:18.526
What the hell, Anna? Aww! Aww, she down!

31:18.550 --> 31:21.129
- Anna, stop playing!
- Aww, no, no.

31:21.153 --> 31:22.763
Stop playing. Anna!

31:22.787 --> 31:25.233
- Hey, don't... no!
- Anna! My God!

31:25.257 --> 31:28.603
Hey, Jasmine, call 911. Jazzy, call 911!

31:28.627 --> 31:29.971
I need to call my dad!

31:29.995 --> 31:32.863
- Anna...
- I need to call my dad.

31:38.980 --> 31:40.257
Listen.

31:41.633 --> 31:44.636
I saw the video, Ray. It's bad.

31:46.513 --> 31:49.547
Your daughter brags about
selling cocaine to this girl

31:49.571 --> 31:51.673
then she overdoses.

31:53.061 --> 31:56.077
Then she calls you, instead of 911.

31:58.547 --> 32:00.225
There's also no police report.

32:00.249 --> 32:03.488
So I'm guessing you...

32:04.659 --> 32:06.217
made the problem go away.

32:06.450 --> 32:10.287
- She's my daughter.
- Ray, what happened, Ray?

32:13.495 --> 32:15.584
Blair found out about the video

32:17.294 --> 32:19.032
or Dennis reach out to him first?

32:19.056 --> 32:20.312
Tell him he had something of value?

32:20.336 --> 32:21.980
Hank, it's not what you think.

32:22.004 --> 32:23.550
Ray!

32:26.887 --> 32:29.056
It's time to come clean right now.

32:31.808 --> 32:35.260
I'm so tired of the lies,

32:35.770 --> 32:38.171
the omissions.

32:40.582 --> 32:42.819
Not knowing who you really are.

32:49.157 --> 32:50.452
You're right.

32:53.747 --> 32:56.537
The young man, Blair, called me.

32:59.086 --> 33:01.553
Told me he knew about the video

33:01.577 --> 33:05.357
and that he wanted me to step down,

33:05.381 --> 33:07.859
to withdraw my candidacy.

33:08.428 --> 33:09.694
And?

33:10.263 --> 33:12.063
I told him to go to hell.

33:12.087 --> 33:15.533
I... am not gonna walk away

33:15.557 --> 33:18.203
just because some Ivy League
pimp was extorting me.

33:18.227 --> 33:19.537
Hell no!

33:22.264 --> 33:24.444
So who did the murders?

33:26.068 --> 33:27.479
I...

33:27.503 --> 33:29.737
Who did the murders, Ray?

33:31.807 --> 33:34.152
Ray, who...

33:34.176 --> 33:36.488
Everything okay in here?

33:36.512 --> 33:40.158
Hank and I are just, talking.

33:42.751 --> 33:45.897
- It's best you leave us alone.
- Yeah.

33:46.174 --> 33:47.966
I said it's best if you...

33:47.990 --> 33:49.567
No.

33:49.591 --> 33:51.221
I don't want to leave you alone.

33:52.094 --> 33:53.438
Not with him.

33:53.462 --> 33:55.463
Not now.

33:56.432 --> 33:58.276
Please, Alicia, just leave.

33:58.300 --> 34:01.135
This smooth-talking prick
was gonna ruin our lives.

34:02.774 --> 34:04.482
Alicia, I think your husband's right.

34:04.506 --> 34:06.017
It's better you stop talking.

34:06.041 --> 34:09.087
He didn't care about us, our family,

34:09.406 --> 34:12.924
all we had been through,
all we were gonna do.

34:12.947 --> 34:15.293
He was just trying
to win some damn election.

34:15.317 --> 34:17.348
Okay, Sergeant Voight
doesn't want to hear...

34:17.371 --> 34:18.763
I told him he was making a big mistake!

34:18.786 --> 34:20.465
- Alicia, shut your damn mouth!
- I... I will not!

34:20.489 --> 34:21.549
- Just shut up!
- I re...

34:21.572 --> 34:22.752
Shut your mouth!

34:23.559 --> 34:25.384
Please!

34:31.623 --> 34:33.221
I did what I did.

34:34.168 --> 34:35.947
I had no choice.

34:38.507 --> 34:42.981
I couldn't let him,
let them ruin our dreams.

34:43.579 --> 34:45.310
Our family.

34:49.318 --> 34:51.197
So I...

34:53.188 --> 34:54.851
I killed Blair.

35:00.562 --> 35:02.834
And then I killed Dennis.

35:17.613 --> 35:19.142
Hank...

35:21.350 --> 35:22.894
I don't know what to say.

35:22.918 --> 35:25.853
- Yeah.
- I don't know what to do.

35:27.356 --> 35:29.534
She wasn't right.

35:29.861 --> 35:31.369
She panicked.

35:32.030 --> 35:34.405
You need to stop talking now.

35:34.429 --> 35:35.909
Just...

35:37.366 --> 35:38.662
Hank...

35:43.792 --> 35:46.173
Hey. What's up? How did it go with Price?

35:48.210 --> 35:49.714
What the hell was that?

35:50.840 --> 35:53.591
I appreciate you meeting me
on such short notice.

35:53.615 --> 35:54.926
Sure thing.

35:54.950 --> 35:56.805
Like I said on the phone,
I'm here to help.

35:57.973 --> 35:59.364
I got a confession

35:59.388 --> 36:01.822
in the Blair Williams,
Dennis Reed murder case.

36:02.891 --> 36:05.192
Is it solid? Did you videotape it?

36:05.894 --> 36:07.691
Got it in writing too

36:08.497 --> 36:10.197
but it's off the record.

36:11.319 --> 36:13.044
Unless we can negotiate a good deal,

36:13.068 --> 36:15.380
it goes away like it never happened.

36:15.991 --> 36:18.449
Go right back to the old
evidence and facts we have

36:18.473 --> 36:20.078
which are not perfect.

36:21.204 --> 36:22.787
I think we both know a decent lawyer

36:22.811 --> 36:24.791
could prove reasonable doubt.

36:25.584 --> 36:27.158
Point taken.

36:27.182 --> 36:29.260
So what's the ask?

36:29.284 --> 36:31.896
Murder two, seven years.

36:31.920 --> 36:34.065
Listen.

36:34.089 --> 36:35.600
The offender was highly emotional.

36:35.624 --> 36:38.736
Acted impulsively, irrationally.

36:38.760 --> 36:40.838
The offender addresses
all that in the video?

36:40.862 --> 36:42.574
It's part of the proffer?

36:42.598 --> 36:44.742
It's all laid out in detail.

36:44.766 --> 36:46.396
And you think it's credible?

36:48.103 --> 36:49.316
I do.

36:50.275 --> 36:52.773
Let me watch the video.
We'll go from there.

36:58.680 --> 37:00.425
My name is Ray Price.

37:00.449 --> 37:02.232
I'm talking to Sergeant Hank Voight

37:02.256 --> 37:04.095
of the Chicago Police Department

37:04.119 --> 37:06.464
about the murders of Blair Williams

37:06.668 --> 37:08.569
and Dennis Reed.

37:09.502 --> 37:11.102
When I learned that Blair Williams

37:11.126 --> 37:12.837
was attempting to purchase a video

37:12.861 --> 37:15.173
that would embarrass my family,

37:15.197 --> 37:16.941
my daughter,

37:16.965 --> 37:20.645
and possibly ruin my chances
of becoming mayor,

37:20.669 --> 37:22.807
I tried to make a deal with him.

37:24.142 --> 37:27.675
I tried to persuade him
to bury the video.

37:28.543 --> 37:30.388
We got into an argument,

37:30.982 --> 37:32.734
began to fight,

37:33.482 --> 37:35.362
and I ended up shooting him.

37:36.905 --> 37:42.690
And then I shot Dennis Reed
in a fit of rage, panic.

37:44.746 --> 37:47.123
When I'd come to my senses,

37:47.957 --> 37:49.876
when I realized what I had done,

37:50.866 --> 37:52.977
I planted evidence on a known drug dealer

37:53.001 --> 37:56.170
by the name of Nate Lewis.

37:58.186 --> 38:01.222
What I did was cowardly and unforgivable.

38:02.944 --> 38:04.516
I'm deeply ashamed

38:05.809 --> 38:08.478
and filled with regret and remorse.

38:09.751 --> 38:11.696
But what I did,

38:11.980 --> 38:14.415
I did for one simple reason.

38:16.277 --> 38:18.269
I love my family.

38:39.467 --> 38:40.969
They feel the same.

38:42.262 --> 38:44.013
Drugs, politics.

38:45.265 --> 38:47.051
Gone's just gone.

38:55.564 --> 38:57.542
Ray Price, the candidate for mayor?

38:57.566 --> 38:58.810
Yeah.

38:58.834 --> 39:00.878
I'm afraid it's gonna be
all over the news.

39:00.902 --> 39:02.547
I think you and your family
should brace yourself.

39:02.571 --> 39:04.392
You're going to be asked
for a lot of interviews

39:04.416 --> 39:06.984
and, I mean, Chicago politics writ large.

39:07.008 --> 39:08.619
Egos, back room deals.

39:08.643 --> 39:10.588
- Right.
- Okay.

39:12.114 --> 39:15.093
Um, we're gonna take him back home.

39:15.336 --> 39:17.261
Have the funeral in Connecticut.

39:17.589 --> 39:19.424
He'll be back with family at least.

39:20.258 --> 39:21.843
Thank you for...

39:24.259 --> 39:25.430
Thank you.

39:26.428 --> 39:27.682
Maya?

39:30.799 --> 39:32.604
Blair and I were dating.

39:33.769 --> 39:36.156
I mean, we were just, like,
at the beginning

39:36.180 --> 39:41.308
but I think it could've
been something truly amazing.

40:12.040 --> 40:14.852
- It's not Special Reserve.
- Yeah.

40:14.876 --> 40:16.854
Not a headache in the bottle.

40:20.482 --> 40:24.228
The ASA bit. You made the deal?

40:24.252 --> 40:25.897
Seven years.

40:40.068 --> 40:42.131
I was so close, Hank.

40:43.591 --> 40:44.982
Really close.

40:49.013 --> 40:54.048
Three weeks away from being
the damn mayor of Chicago.

41:04.860 --> 41:07.129
Yeah, it would have been
a hell of a thing.
