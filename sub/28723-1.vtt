WEBVTT

00:33.416 --> 00:36.666
Ten years gone, 'proaching
that self-same hill

00:36.749 --> 00:39.999
I thought to lay me down
and rise no more.

00:41.332 --> 00:42.874
Oof.

00:42.957 --> 00:46.207
Give wide berth!
That's just passed wind!

00:47.165 --> 00:48.749
Possibly worse.

00:55.708 --> 00:58.833
Before eyes close
for good and all...

00:59.791 --> 01:03.040
I'd once again see
my Joanie Stubbs...

01:04.956 --> 01:07.124
show her a sign of...

01:08.749 --> 01:10.457
loving regret

01:10.541 --> 01:13.624
from Calamity Jane
to her darling.

01:15.457 --> 01:18.708
And, too, at
the grave of Wild Bill.

01:27.874 --> 01:29.165
Ooh.

01:31.791 --> 01:33.708
Oof, I've a left-cheek
ass blister's

01:33.791 --> 01:36.082
a percolating
son of a bitch.

02:04.999 --> 02:06.207
Good, right there.

02:15.124 --> 02:17.249
Morning, Boss!

02:17.332 --> 02:18.583
Get me the gimp.

02:19.124 --> 02:21.124
- Jewel!
- What?

02:21.207 --> 02:22.416
Get up here.

02:22.499 --> 02:25.124
Have something
on the stove, Al!

02:25.207 --> 02:27.457
Well, once you finish
burning it, then.

02:27.541 --> 02:29.874
Ho, ho, ho.

02:30.291 --> 02:32.791
- Morning, Doc.
- Morning, Al.

02:33.332 --> 02:35.708
Uh, at liberty...

02:35.791 --> 02:36.833
are you just now?

02:39.124 --> 02:40.874
Why, you wanna dance?

02:58.999 --> 03:01.249
What'd that be about?

03:01.791 --> 03:03.583
Fashioning into
telephone poles.

03:03.666 --> 03:05.874
Ain't we got enough of
them damn things already?

03:06.249 --> 03:08.708
Plan's to put lines
in every business.

03:08.791 --> 03:10.749
Catch up with the times!

03:13.541 --> 03:16.249
Out of sorts,
would you say, Commander?

03:17.040 --> 03:19.541
Half a stride
short of fully fit.

03:19.874 --> 03:22.583
Light, somewhat,
a few pounds.

03:23.374 --> 03:24.957
And some bit
pallid, too.

03:25.040 --> 03:27.416
Ah, Jesus, just shoot me, Doc.

03:27.499 --> 03:30.291
Name the day
of the week, Al.

03:30.666 --> 03:32.499
The fuck difference
does the day make?

03:32.583 --> 03:34.124
I'd have you but
say the name.

03:34.499 --> 03:38.040
Tuesday then, you half a
scarecrow-looking cocksucker.

03:38.666 --> 03:39.874
Friday, it is.

03:39.957 --> 03:41.165
Oh.

03:41.249 --> 03:42.499
Mistaking Friday for Tuesday.

03:42.583 --> 03:45.082
Well, secure my burial plot.

03:45.165 --> 03:47.957
Well, your temperature's
two degrees above normal,

03:48.040 --> 03:49.541
features drawn,

03:49.624 --> 03:51.624
flesh of a yellowish cast.

03:51.708 --> 03:54.165
Pending fucking
developments...

03:54.749 --> 03:57.207
I'd have you forbear
from spirits.

03:58.541 --> 04:01.291
- Under advisement.
- Oh, no, no, no.

04:01.374 --> 04:03.708
Don't you humor me,
nor talk down to me neither,

04:03.791 --> 04:06.541
nor fix to mix in where
you ain't been invited.

04:06.624 --> 04:09.999
Whilst you comport
the very like to me?

04:10.082 --> 04:13.541
You went somewhat wrong
at your liver, Al,

04:13.624 --> 04:15.874
is what you've
God damn done!

04:20.666 --> 04:23.416
Bar you being
out-and-out blind,

04:23.499 --> 04:25.082
you already
know he's ill.

04:25.165 --> 04:26.708
Minute past,

04:26.791 --> 04:29.291
words to Dan,
"Boss is looking poorly.

04:29.374 --> 04:30.749
Out of sorts."

04:30.833 --> 04:34.374
Don't he look outta sorts,
you goddamn donkey?

04:34.457 --> 04:36.541
He is to forbear

04:36.624 --> 04:39.332
from spirits of any kind,

04:39.416 --> 04:41.499
until he's assayed and diagnosed.

04:45.291 --> 04:46.749
You know he'll just endeavor

04:46.833 --> 04:49.207
to import spirits
in off the street?

04:49.291 --> 04:50.999
Well, you're not to allow it!

04:51.082 --> 04:53.624
That's easier told
than saddled and rode.

04:53.708 --> 04:55.749
Well then, go ahead
and hang him, goddamn it!

04:55.833 --> 04:57.457
Blow his fuckin' head off!

04:57.541 --> 04:59.874
Save us all some time!

05:04.416 --> 05:06.457
Wrong side of
the damn bed!

05:17.165 --> 05:18.915
Mrs. Ellsworth! Charlie Utter.

05:18.999 --> 05:21.749
Oh my.

05:21.833 --> 05:24.833
What a grand surprise
after such a piece of time.

05:25.207 --> 05:27.249
For me, Mr. Utter,
as well.

05:28.416 --> 05:29.624
Sofia! Come on!

05:31.833 --> 05:34.499
Am I past my place,
Ms. Ellsworth,

05:34.583 --> 05:37.082
asking if it's banking
brings you back these parts?

05:38.332 --> 05:40.082
Banking, yes.

05:40.165 --> 05:41.957
My interest in
the Deadwood Bank,

05:42.040 --> 05:45.249
which is an expanding
institution...

05:48.207 --> 05:50.207
Few years back,
Mrs. Ellsworth,

05:50.291 --> 05:51.708
bad manners like
that woulda lead

05:51.791 --> 05:54.374
to a lesson in courtesy!

05:54.457 --> 05:56.499
Continuing grateful

05:56.583 --> 05:58.749
for hard-won maturity.

06:00.624 --> 06:04.416
Sofia, a gentleman wishes
to renew acquaintance, Miss.

06:05.207 --> 06:08.332
Charlie Utter saying
hello to Miss Sofia.

06:08.416 --> 06:10.291
The 10 years
went past like...

06:10.374 --> 06:12.040
- -somebody
snapped their fingers.

06:12.124 --> 06:13.791
Hello back,
Mr. Utter.

06:13.874 --> 06:16.915
- It's lovely to see you again.
- Thank you.

06:16.999 --> 06:18.416
Hey, I'd be happy
to convey you all

06:18.499 --> 06:20.207
into Deadwood camp
in my wagon.

06:20.291 --> 06:23.082
As we would be
for the transport,

06:23.165 --> 06:24.957
and your
good company.

06:25.040 --> 06:26.583
Oh well,
come on.

06:26.666 --> 06:29.040
I hope we're in time
for the statehood celebration.

06:29.124 --> 06:31.331
- Go as quick as I'm able.
- Hey, sweetheart.

06:31.332 --> 06:33.040
Help you with
that luggage.

06:33.124 --> 06:34.957
Very kind,
I'm okay.

06:35.040 --> 06:37.332
Well, I assume you'll
be staying in town, darling.

06:38.082 --> 06:39.249
Pardon me.

06:39.457 --> 06:42.541
There a price we can offer
for that information?

06:42.624 --> 06:44.791
You have
me wrong.

06:47.541 --> 06:49.332
Oh, there you are!

06:49.416 --> 06:51.936
- Hello there.
- Looking for a ride. I can pay.

06:53.374 --> 06:56.332
South Dakota
marrying the United States.

06:56.416 --> 06:58.164
Oh!
See, they're paying attention, Seth.

06:58.165 --> 07:00.499
- Morning, miss.
- Morning, Papa.

07:00.583 --> 07:03.332
Bullock clan ready for
the statehood festivities.

07:03.416 --> 07:04.749
Are you ready,
husband,

07:04.833 --> 07:06.666
considering the visiting
delegates include

07:06.749 --> 07:08.541
the senator
from California?

07:08.624 --> 07:10.666
To celebrate,
yes, I am.

07:12.583 --> 07:15.165
I'm tempted
to believe you.

07:19.207 --> 07:21.207
Statehood pancakes
coming out!

07:24.082 --> 07:25.165
Clear the way!

07:25.249 --> 07:28.082
All right, all right,
little man.

07:28.165 --> 07:30.749
Single-minded, this boy,
like his old man.

07:30.833 --> 07:32.416
A virtue in
your estimation.

07:34.915 --> 07:38.499
Lord, bless these gifts
we ready to receive,

07:38.583 --> 07:40.457
and grant us grace
to meet level-headed

07:40.541 --> 07:42.791
what challenges
may come this day...

07:43.833 --> 07:45.624
no matter
the provocation by lesser

07:45.708 --> 07:47.791
or evil men.

07:49.874 --> 07:51.915
Amen.

07:52.207 --> 07:53.874
- Amen.
- Amen.

07:54.708 --> 07:56.124
On this day

07:56.207 --> 07:58.708
- of our statehood celebration...
- Hear, hear!

07:58.791 --> 08:02.666
...we honor a man who with
unexampled generosity

08:02.749 --> 08:05.957
has give of himself to
our Deadwood community.

08:06.040 --> 08:08.541
Though no longer
residing amongst us,

08:08.624 --> 08:11.416
he calls California
now his home.

08:11.791 --> 08:15.583
The man bases his considerable
mining and real estate interest

08:16.374 --> 08:19.165
here in Deadwood, South Dakota.

08:19.249 --> 08:20.499
I ask you please

08:20.583 --> 08:23.207
to greet with me now,
the honorable

08:23.291 --> 08:25.957
junior senator from the great
state of California,

08:26.040 --> 08:28.833
George Ambrose Hearst!

08:44.583 --> 08:47.165
- Good morning to all!
- Morning, Senator!

08:47.249 --> 08:49.416
And great thanks
to Mayor Farnum

08:49.499 --> 08:52.249
for his generous
words of welcome.

08:54.374 --> 08:55.999
It moves me greatly,

08:57.249 --> 09:01.082
returning after years
have passed to witness

09:01.457 --> 09:03.624
the changes wrought

09:03.708 --> 09:04.999
by time,

09:05.082 --> 09:07.666
ingenuity, and invention.

09:07.749 --> 09:09.909
- Though none would deny the facts
- MARTHA: Excuse me.

09:09.957 --> 09:12.541
And the cost of a past,

09:12.624 --> 09:15.374
we who gather have
known together...

09:20.666 --> 09:22.874
Some portion of
which must still

09:22.957 --> 09:25.124
be measured in blood.

09:26.416 --> 09:28.541
Yet, the Deadwood community

09:28.624 --> 09:30.124
does enter its adulthood...

09:30.207 --> 09:33.040
And don't our
spirits raise,

09:33.124 --> 09:35.499
you murdering,
conniving,

09:35.583 --> 09:37.499
thieving cocksucker.

09:37.583 --> 09:40.082
Resourceful
and resolute,

09:40.374 --> 09:43.957
a vital part of the new-made
state of South Dakota,

09:44.040 --> 09:45.666
and this state

09:45.749 --> 09:48.499
a vital part of
our fine country.

09:48.583 --> 09:49.708
Amen to that!

09:54.833 --> 09:56.541
Thank you, Senator!

10:08.124 --> 10:11.708
Hotel's but two rooms short
of fully occupied, Trixie,

10:11.791 --> 10:14.457
with the parade yet
still in full swing.

10:14.833 --> 10:16.957
Congratulations
then, Mr. Star,

10:17.040 --> 10:18.833
to you
and Marshal Bullock.

10:19.915 --> 10:23.416
Maybe mark the moment braining
me with a fucking brick!

10:23.499 --> 10:26.040
I'd sooner put a ring
on your finger.

10:27.207 --> 10:29.624
Once first we've seen
does the baby survive.

10:29.708 --> 10:32.207
That being, in your
scripture, matrimony's single

10:32.291 --> 10:34.082
reason
and purpose.

10:34.541 --> 10:36.541
Ain't we already
awash in the miracle

10:36.624 --> 10:39.457
of a whore of my vintage
being pregnant at all?

10:39.541 --> 10:41.874
Well, why not wear a sign, then?

10:42.583 --> 10:44.791
Dress in red, head to toe?

10:46.583 --> 10:49.499
Please, Trixie.
You oughtn't show your face outside.

10:49.583 --> 10:52.957
Lemonade's on its way with
chips of ice, how you like.

10:53.874 --> 10:55.583
Rest now.

10:55.666 --> 10:57.874
I just got the fuck up.

10:58.124 --> 10:59.457
Rest.

11:24.915 --> 11:26.749
Senator! Senator!

12:12.124 --> 12:14.291
Murdering motherless cocksucker.

12:19.457 --> 12:22.499
Oh, Senator Hearst!
Your honor!

12:24.207 --> 12:25.791
Yoo-hoo!

12:26.124 --> 12:29.207
On this 10th anniversary
of them being butchered,

12:29.291 --> 12:32.249
I convey to you, Senator,
memorial greetings

12:32.332 --> 12:34.915
from the miner Ellsworth
and prostitute Jen.

12:37.666 --> 12:39.832
- But two of the who knows how many
- BANDLEADER: Hold it!

12:39.833 --> 12:42.583
You've done for while making
your moneyed progress!

12:42.666 --> 12:44.624
Have I missed word
of your appointment

12:44.708 --> 12:46.583
to some position
of authority?

12:46.666 --> 12:48.666
Have I missed
word of yours,

12:48.749 --> 12:51.833
you bald-pated cunt?!

13:01.583 --> 13:02.914
Better watch
yourself, Senator!

13:02.915 --> 13:04.666
Mr. Hearst?

13:08.499 --> 13:09.624
Oh.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.374
For ain't it so, sir.

13:13.457 --> 13:15.791
It's the thieving
and throat-cutting,

13:15.874 --> 13:17.708
them's bloodied
and dead in the mud,

13:17.791 --> 13:19.791
as still stiffens the member
in your long-johns!

13:19.874 --> 13:22.624
Well, why not press forward,
for Christ's sake?

13:22.708 --> 13:24.124
Set herself aflame?

13:24.207 --> 13:27.583
Nor, ought I fail to remark

13:27.666 --> 13:29.624
the semblance from
this vantage twixt

13:29.708 --> 13:33.207
your very mug and a snatch
has gone haired-over-sideways.

13:33.291 --> 13:34.666
Oh!

13:34.749 --> 13:36.499
Mayor Farnum! It's a...

13:36.583 --> 13:37.874
Trixie hasn't
lost her gift.

13:37.957 --> 13:39.457
She ain't for a fact.

13:39.541 --> 13:40.957
Time can't touch that.

13:41.040 --> 13:43.291
...letting this slimy
cocksucker slither his way

13:43.374 --> 13:45.124
into our camp's
inner workings!

13:45.207 --> 13:47.874
And aren't you
the vile bodying

13:47.957 --> 13:50.915
of a gutter-mouth
trollop and tramp! Go.

13:50.999 --> 13:53.708
- As you are of a murdering shitheel!
- Now.

13:53.791 --> 13:54.791
Trixie!

13:58.749 --> 14:01.165
What's left still
to do, Trixie?

14:01.249 --> 14:02.999
Pitch yourself
down the stairs?

14:03.082 --> 14:05.624
End any chance of our
child's well-being?

14:07.624 --> 14:09.374
Jesus wept!

14:09.457 --> 14:11.624
What is it?

14:12.082 --> 14:14.791
Something amiss,
as you fuckin' foresaw.

14:16.207 --> 14:18.124
Ready for the doc we are?

14:18.207 --> 14:20.416
- Off you go then to fetch him.
- Okay.

14:26.082 --> 14:28.666
I'll be good.

14:28.749 --> 14:30.249
Marshal!

14:32.583 --> 14:34.082
Mr. Utter!

14:34.165 --> 14:36.332
- Hello.
- Hello, girls.

14:36.416 --> 14:38.791
- Greetings from Uncle Charlie.
- Uncle Charlie!

14:39.332 --> 14:41.583
It's lovely
to see you both again.

14:41.666 --> 14:43.374
Mrs. Bullock.

14:43.457 --> 14:46.040
I remember your reading
lessons so well.

14:47.624 --> 14:49.457
Mrs. Ellsworth
here and her daughter,

14:49.541 --> 14:51.541
they need a room.

14:51.624 --> 14:54.583
I told them best hotel
in town's right there.

14:55.207 --> 14:57.291
Perhaps installing
Mrs. Ellsworth in a suite

14:57.374 --> 15:01.082
would be the considerate thing
for the hotel's owner to do?

15:01.165 --> 15:02.791
Yes, it would.

15:18.833 --> 15:21.833
Mrs. Ellsworth,
was there a room available?

15:21.915 --> 15:23.957
Uh, it-it seems...

15:24.040 --> 15:26.374
we've secured
the very last one.

15:26.457 --> 15:28.249
Must be
my lucky day.

15:28.957 --> 15:31.165
I'll walk
you upstairs.

15:36.040 --> 15:39.249
You, having
so lived in recollection,

15:39.332 --> 15:40.749
Marshal,

15:40.833 --> 15:43.833
it is my considerable
happiness to see you again.

15:44.499 --> 15:46.374
No less a happiness,
Mrs. Ellsworth,

15:46.457 --> 15:48.457
than of seeing you for me.

15:50.332 --> 15:53.915
As a dream might come
alive to draw a breath.

16:06.957 --> 16:08.291
Said overmuch.

16:08.374 --> 16:11.207
Vowed I wouldn't,
but I absolutely knew I would.

16:13.708 --> 16:15.791
Why didn't you write
of your arrival?

16:17.291 --> 16:18.791
Not sure.

16:18.874 --> 16:20.207
I see.

16:23.416 --> 16:24.791
I wonder,

16:24.874 --> 16:26.416
Mr. Bullock,
if all

16:26.957 --> 16:28.291
unwitting...

16:28.915 --> 16:31.374
I may have done something
to upset an apple cart.

16:32.541 --> 16:34.207
Not at all.

16:34.291 --> 16:36.791
It's a pleasure to
see you both again.

16:48.791 --> 16:49.915
What?

16:49.999 --> 16:51.957
Nothing, Mama.

16:55.082 --> 16:57.499
Bullock! Hey, Marshal!

16:58.583 --> 17:00.582
- Just the man I was looking for.
- Coulda warned me

17:00.583 --> 17:02.416
of Mrs. Ellsworth's
return, Charlie.

17:02.499 --> 17:04.290
How the fuck, when
I was surprised myself?

17:04.374 --> 17:07.207
Very least not deposit her
in my goddamn hotel!

17:07.290 --> 17:09.874
Hey, if you're finished
rapping my knuckles,

17:09.957 --> 17:12.749
I got some more manly
matters to discuss.

17:14.374 --> 17:15.749
I'm all ears,
Charlie.

17:18.082 --> 17:20.665
Hearst wants
to buy my land.

17:21.082 --> 17:24.457
Dangling big paydays
through third parties.

17:25.124 --> 17:26.957
He's coming today hisself.

17:28.290 --> 17:30.708
- Are you disposed?
- My age, I'd...

17:30.791 --> 17:33.999
be a fool not to
chew on it some.

17:35.874 --> 17:37.999
Which, uh, evidently,
Bullock that looks away,

17:38.082 --> 17:39.666
scowling like he is,

17:39.749 --> 17:41.499
don't approve of.

17:43.291 --> 17:44.874
Utter's pal Bullock

17:44.957 --> 17:46.749
figures if Utter
sold off his land,

17:46.833 --> 17:49.499
nothing for Utter to do
but sit wondering,

17:49.583 --> 17:52.124
in that old saloon,
why in hell

17:52.207 --> 17:54.040
he'd sold the thing
he'd spent his life

17:54.124 --> 17:56.708
getting situated
to buy and keep

17:56.791 --> 17:58.457
to work it himself?

17:59.791 --> 18:02.165
Hearst doesn't deserve
your land, Charlie.

18:02.249 --> 18:04.541
Nor ought I either
fail to bring to mind

18:04.624 --> 18:07.416
the bastard's
disposition to foul play.

18:13.207 --> 18:14.583
Before negotiations
commence,

18:14.666 --> 18:16.999
would I be out of place
calling on Hearst myself?

18:17.499 --> 18:21.124
I wonder, too, might you
procure me an infant's linen?

18:21.541 --> 18:24.457
And you don't make a friend
a stranger, Charlie.

18:24.541 --> 18:27.207
Decline him walking beside you.

18:27.833 --> 18:30.082
Saying first,
my being grateful

18:30.165 --> 18:32.583
and heartily appreciative,

18:33.332 --> 18:36.249
I'd hold with your
friend best achieving

18:36.332 --> 18:40.082
his purposes toting
his water hisself.

18:44.999 --> 18:46.666
Join us for
dinner tonight.

18:46.749 --> 18:49.624
You amaze my boy pulling
coins from your ears.

18:49.708 --> 18:50.999
Better trick
would be me pulling

18:51.082 --> 18:53.291
Hearst's hundreds
out my ass.

18:53.374 --> 18:55.708
Expect you 7:00, Uncle Charlie.

18:56.124 --> 18:57.249
Thanks, Bullock,

18:57.332 --> 18:58.957
for the lookout.

19:18.040 --> 19:21.624
Good morning,
Miss Newly-Arrived!

19:22.124 --> 19:24.291
Might you be
the establishment's operator?

19:25.040 --> 19:26.291
Named Al.

19:26.374 --> 19:28.249
Swearengen's
the remainder,

19:28.332 --> 19:29.915
if you ain't
overmuch gave pause

19:29.999 --> 19:32.416
to the various
ins and outs.

19:32.499 --> 19:34.332
My name's Caroline Woolgarden,
Mr. Swearengen,

19:34.416 --> 19:36.457
which I imagine don't
slide easy off the tongue

19:36.541 --> 19:38.082
any more than yours does.

19:38.915 --> 19:42.374
Caroline Woolgarden,
like butter.

19:42.457 --> 19:45.957
Come new to town in hope of
renting one of your fine rooms.

19:46.040 --> 19:47.416
Oh...

19:49.791 --> 19:50.915
Ah...

19:51.624 --> 19:53.040
Shitbird in prospect.

19:53.124 --> 19:55.749
Would you excuse me,
Miss Woolgarden?

20:00.332 --> 20:02.082
Ah, produce

20:02.165 --> 20:04.833
George Hearst Esquire,

20:04.915 --> 20:07.957
colossus of commerce,
junior senator from California,

20:08.040 --> 20:10.541
who since our paths
last crossed

20:10.624 --> 20:12.374
has went from strength

20:12.457 --> 20:15.708
to stronger strength still.

20:17.624 --> 20:19.666
Even as you name me,

20:19.749 --> 20:23.541
a figure to be reckoned with in this
camp, Mr. Swearengen,

20:24.040 --> 20:26.874
I have been made this morning,

20:26.957 --> 20:29.040
more than somewhat,

20:29.124 --> 20:31.374
to look an incompetent.

20:33.791 --> 20:34.957
You, sir?

20:35.040 --> 20:38.040
An incompetent?
Now, how would that ever be?

20:38.499 --> 20:40.915
These years now past,
I'd have you recall

20:40.999 --> 20:43.541
my having been attacked.

20:43.624 --> 20:45.165
Shot,

20:45.249 --> 20:48.499
and near as not,
done in by a whore,

20:48.583 --> 20:51.082
whose name,
if I ever knew it,

20:51.165 --> 20:53.583
has now been lost to me.

20:54.291 --> 20:55.999
I dimly recall the matter.

20:56.082 --> 20:59.416
The nameless whore embarked
on a program of vengeance,

20:59.499 --> 21:01.915
and, by God,
she nearly brought off.

21:01.999 --> 21:04.416
Referring to her
attempt to murder me.

21:04.499 --> 21:06.332
Not to pretty the picture.

21:07.249 --> 21:08.291
I have lived

21:08.374 --> 21:11.749
believing the matter
had been settled.

21:11.833 --> 21:15.999
And I was satisfied
in that belief.

21:16.082 --> 21:18.749
But now, I realize
I was tricked.

21:18.833 --> 21:22.833
The whore you presented in the
box was not the shooter at all.

21:25.499 --> 21:27.416
Ah, you're going for the long,

21:27.499 --> 21:29.957
larger-minded view, Senator.

21:30.040 --> 21:32.416
Which depends on
running telephone lines

21:32.499 --> 21:34.124
across the claims.

21:34.207 --> 21:37.040
On recognizing
common ground,

21:37.124 --> 21:38.874
bringing the future to it.

21:39.249 --> 21:40.957
A brief illustration
of my point...

21:41.040 --> 21:44.040
Does brevity exist in
your repertoire, sir?

21:48.833 --> 21:52.583
I am making an offer
on Charlie Utter's land.

21:53.999 --> 21:57.082
Lumber for construction
arrived this morning.

21:57.666 --> 21:59.749
Confident, are we?

21:59.833 --> 22:03.583
Back my bid for buying up
Utter's property.

22:05.124 --> 22:07.416
Use your position in
the town to sway others,

22:07.499 --> 22:11.040
and I will drop any
counteraction against the whore.

22:11.541 --> 22:14.416
The pregnant whore
who attacked me.

22:14.833 --> 22:18.082
Uncharacteristically
straightforward, sir.

22:21.416 --> 22:23.291
Discover your deepest nature,

22:23.374 --> 22:25.374
Mr. Swearengen.

22:25.666 --> 22:27.332
Walk with the future.

22:39.165 --> 22:40.624
How'd that do you, Al?

22:40.708 --> 22:42.165
Good like
it seemed?

22:42.249 --> 22:43.914
Best time to produce Trixie

22:43.915 --> 22:46.583
so I can sell her on
silence as virtue.

22:47.416 --> 22:49.416
On it, Boss.

22:55.040 --> 22:58.249
That's it.
Blow it out, just blow it out.

23:03.165 --> 23:05.624
Christ, Jesus, Mary, and Joseph!

23:05.874 --> 23:07.749
They're arrayed to
support you, Ms. Trixie,

23:07.833 --> 23:09.708
but you're the one
who's got to be pushing!

23:09.791 --> 23:13.499
Which don't I, in Christ,
look to be doing, Aunt Lou?

23:15.833 --> 23:18.124
Dan Dority!

23:18.207 --> 23:20.207
Speaking for Al that
needs words with Trixie!

23:20.291 --> 23:21.499
Trixie ain't receiving,

23:21.583 --> 23:23.791
hard as she's coming
for home. If you'd just

23:23.874 --> 23:26.291
tell Al,
we'll issue word...

23:26.374 --> 23:27.707
- Come on, come on.
- ...from this quarter

23:27.708 --> 23:29.583
as we are fucking able!

23:29.666 --> 23:32.040
Okay. I hear you, Doc.

23:32.999 --> 23:34.915
One more push, Trixie.

23:34.999 --> 23:37.915
This is it.

23:38.583 --> 23:40.543
- Now, we doing something.
- And...

23:40.624 --> 23:41.624
Now we doing it.

23:41.666 --> 23:43.249
Okay.

23:43.332 --> 23:45.165
See his business?

23:45.249 --> 23:46.499
You got a boy!

23:46.915 --> 23:48.666
A boy.

23:49.249 --> 23:50.791
Go ahead,

23:50.874 --> 23:52.374
and slap his backside.

23:54.957 --> 23:56.165
There we go.

24:00.165 --> 24:01.874
Oh, Trixie.

24:01.957 --> 24:04.291
Hello, Joshua.

24:04.374 --> 24:06.165
Lord keep you.

24:07.874 --> 24:11.082
Ms. Calamity
Jane Cannary.

24:11.165 --> 24:12.749
Charlie Utter.

24:13.291 --> 24:16.165
Some putting odds up
train bring you home in a box.

24:16.541 --> 24:18.999
I come to collect
Joanie Stubbs.

24:23.416 --> 24:24.541
Oh, God.

24:28.874 --> 24:30.416
How would you, uh,

24:30.499 --> 24:33.957
describe the Stubbs
woman's state of affairs?

24:34.040 --> 24:36.624
Not seeing her consistent, I...

24:36.708 --> 24:40.374
I say Joanie Stubbs'
collecting her portion of

24:40.457 --> 24:43.291
gloom and dismay,
just like any of us.

24:45.249 --> 24:46.874
Well, suppo...

24:47.207 --> 24:48.957
Suppose, Charlie...

24:49.624 --> 24:53.541
say a, a person had a
interest in that situation,

24:54.249 --> 24:55.957
what, by your lights,
would be a right way

24:56.040 --> 24:57.541
of broaching the subject?

24:58.332 --> 25:00.082
I'd maybe say...

25:01.999 --> 25:03.666
you been thinking of her,

25:04.082 --> 25:05.583
hoping...

25:06.040 --> 25:08.249
if ever she
thought of you,

25:08.791 --> 25:11.416
her thinking would
be friendly, too.

25:12.583 --> 25:15.416
Write me that down to repeat
it, you cocksucker.

25:15.499 --> 25:17.165
You know what to say, Jane.

25:18.583 --> 25:19.666
What to do.

25:20.374 --> 25:22.583
I will stand you
to a drink.

25:23.915 --> 25:25.791
Down it along with you,
too, far as that goes.

25:25.874 --> 25:28.082
- One drink.
- Fuck one drink.

25:29.749 --> 25:31.249
Go find your girl.

25:31.583 --> 25:32.915
Go get her.

25:33.915 --> 25:34.957
Pssh.

25:44.874 --> 25:46.124
I'd have a word,

25:46.957 --> 25:49.249
either with management,

25:49.332 --> 25:51.874
or just some girl ain't
on her back just now,

25:51.957 --> 25:53.457
legs straight up in the air!

25:53.708 --> 25:55.124
If you want the boss,

25:55.207 --> 25:56.957
Joanie's upstairs.

25:57.457 --> 25:58.624
Oh?

25:59.708 --> 26:00.791
Busy?

26:01.249 --> 26:03.957
- I didn't see.
- No, we didn't see.

26:38.874 --> 26:42.082
Jane Cannary come
a-calling, Miss Stubbs.

26:42.499 --> 26:44.957
I'd be grateful if
you'd hold your fire.

26:53.249 --> 26:55.374
Everyone got
plenty of room?

26:56.749 --> 26:58.749
Seem to be making due.

27:00.999 --> 27:03.541
Why don't me and Deenie
just get outta here, Joanie?

27:04.624 --> 27:05.874
We don't want
no trouble.

27:07.249 --> 27:10.583
Well arrived, Jane.

27:10.666 --> 27:12.457
- Welcome home.
- Go fuck yourself.

27:12.541 --> 27:15.207
Hold her soap!

27:29.833 --> 27:32.124
Considerable time
since seeing you.

27:33.040 --> 27:36.207
Wasn't me setting off see the
country, see the world.

27:36.291 --> 27:39.291
Weren't we sure as fuck done
with each other back then?

27:39.374 --> 27:41.541
Not on none of my say-so.

27:52.957 --> 27:55.708
Well, go on.
Say what you wanna say.

27:55.791 --> 27:57.124
Uh, just...

27:57.207 --> 28:00.082
surprised to find
you back here is all.

28:00.915 --> 28:02.374
I'd be grateful

28:02.457 --> 28:04.499
keeping opinions
to yourself concerning

28:04.583 --> 28:06.499
my whereabouts
and purposes.

28:06.583 --> 28:08.791
You wanna brawl,
we can do it.

28:09.833 --> 28:12.583
Brawling's unseemly,
girl my age.

28:13.999 --> 28:16.249
Charlie Utter said
you been better.

28:19.374 --> 28:21.791
Is that right? Charlie did?

28:25.291 --> 28:27.999
High on dope,
as I suppose you'd have to be,

28:28.082 --> 28:30.791
consorting with them
miserable cunts.

28:31.999 --> 28:34.999
New old damn shooter
coming out.

28:35.082 --> 28:38.291
Believed the game shut down
when she left the table.

29:05.457 --> 29:09.457
These placer acres that
you own, Mr. Utter,

29:10.165 --> 29:11.791
captured my attention.

29:12.124 --> 29:15.165
Scouts you sent previous
made that clear.

29:15.499 --> 29:18.915
People whose
judgment I respect

29:18.999 --> 29:21.249
assay this property's
market value

29:21.332 --> 29:23.499
at $3,500.

29:26.833 --> 29:30.666
Seems I'm the lone holdout
on the path of progress.

29:32.416 --> 29:36.583
By way of abbreviating
our back and forth and...

29:36.666 --> 29:39.165
maybe generating
some good will,

29:39.416 --> 29:42.874
I'd go 500 above.

29:42.957 --> 29:44.874
Offer you...

29:45.374 --> 29:47.708
4,000 even, cash money.

29:55.541 --> 29:57.874
My father taught his boy,

29:57.957 --> 30:01.040
uh, "beat hell into him"
might maybe be more accurate,

30:01.124 --> 30:03.749
how if, uh,

30:03.833 --> 30:05.499
early enough on,

30:05.583 --> 30:08.874
you credited
the settlements was coming,

30:10.124 --> 30:13.124
bought acres reasonable,

30:13.207 --> 30:15.040
developed 'em sensible,

30:15.124 --> 30:17.874
hung onto 'em until
the market come right,

30:19.124 --> 30:21.874
of a day you might
could wake up and find

30:21.957 --> 30:25.165
you made yourself
a respectable investment.

30:25.624 --> 30:28.541
Forward thinking
was your father then.

30:28.624 --> 30:32.874
And now, here's his boy to
confirm his papa's prediction.

30:34.374 --> 30:36.082
Contrary-wise,

30:37.332 --> 30:39.499
man might could...

30:39.583 --> 30:42.915
come to certain
special feelings.

30:43.915 --> 30:45.040
Partial, say,

30:45.124 --> 30:47.291
to a piece of ground.

30:48.291 --> 30:49.666
A river...

30:50.416 --> 30:53.165
bending through
the forest like so.

31:02.207 --> 31:04.624
I decline your offer,
Mr. Hearst,

31:05.749 --> 31:07.999
thanking you for your time

31:08.082 --> 31:10.082
and attention.

31:14.999 --> 31:18.791
My experience over time
has come to be...

31:20.291 --> 31:24.040
customarily,
I am he who starts a negotiation.

31:25.040 --> 31:26.833
Names its finish, too.

31:29.833 --> 31:32.040
Maybe getting
mother-fucked this morning

31:32.124 --> 31:35.249
in the thoroughfare,
by a woman in the bargain,

31:35.332 --> 31:37.457
has somewhat
got your back up.

31:38.124 --> 31:40.249
Not the accolade
you'd looked for

31:40.332 --> 31:43.457
out your return
to fuckin' camp.

31:44.124 --> 31:45.666
Proffering that
assessment, sir,

31:45.749 --> 31:47.833
is hardly your
proper bailiwick.

31:47.915 --> 31:51.666
Far as that, I went and
proffered it any-fuckin'-way.

32:12.749 --> 32:14.457
Any soul on the grounds

32:14.541 --> 32:16.915
bearing mortal
likeness to a walrus,

32:16.999 --> 32:19.040
raise up your right hand
or whistle.

32:20.332 --> 32:21.915
You, Tom Nuttall!

32:21.999 --> 32:23.541
Up with your right,

32:23.624 --> 32:26.124
or purse your damn lips
and blow!

32:28.749 --> 32:30.583
Pitiful effort.

32:30.833 --> 32:32.499
Welcome home,
Jane.

32:32.999 --> 32:35.165
'Scription to propose.

32:35.499 --> 32:37.666
Tombstone above a casket.

32:39.332 --> 32:40.749
"On this spot...

32:43.374 --> 32:45.541
"Was Bill Hickok

32:45.624 --> 32:47.249

33:29.207 --> 33:31.957
And to speak
straightforward, Jane,

33:32.040 --> 33:33.999
you mortally installed

33:34.082 --> 33:36.999
and decaying
'neath this building

33:37.082 --> 33:39.791
don't strike me as
a magnet for commerce.

33:39.874 --> 33:42.457
Because you're headless
for business, Tom,

33:42.541 --> 33:44.666
and heedless
and horse-faced to boot!

33:44.749 --> 33:48.332
- - Well,
why not empty the graveyards?

33:48.416 --> 33:50.833
We'll spot corpses
at the tables,

33:50.915 --> 33:53.374
needling the gloom overall.

33:53.457 --> 33:55.666
That's a rotten idea.

33:55.749 --> 33:57.332
Fuck yourself, Arty.

34:07.957 --> 34:09.956
What are you selling, Wu?

34:10.040 --> 34:11.123
Swedgin.

34:11.206 --> 34:12.541
You.

34:12.623 --> 34:15.456
He has medicine for you.

34:16.623 --> 34:18.541
Swedgin.

34:18.623 --> 34:20.791
Your color
looks wrong.

34:26.791 --> 34:28.291
Mengyao,
you for hire?

34:28.541 --> 34:29.998
Yes, Mr. Swedgin.

34:30.081 --> 34:31.873
Good.

34:31.956 --> 34:33.291
I want you to

34:33.791 --> 34:35.373
take this note

34:35.456 --> 34:38.708
to Sol Star to give
to his lady, Trixie,

34:38.791 --> 34:41.373
over at the Bullock
Star Hotel

34:41.456 --> 34:43.291
over the road there.

34:44.416 --> 34:47.206
- You got that?
- How much will you pay me?

34:52.748 --> 34:54.666
Payment upon return,

34:54.748 --> 34:57.165
and job verified complete.

34:58.791 --> 35:01.082
Now go wait outside
the door for your grandad.

35:05.666 --> 35:06.749
Oh yeah.

35:11.499 --> 35:14.124
Swedgin. Drink. Tea.

35:14.207 --> 35:15.833
You drink tea.

35:16.749 --> 35:18.457
No! No!

35:18.999 --> 35:21.082
I'll cut your chink throat
for a "no,"

35:21.165 --> 35:23.457
and pitch you off the balcony
with the other one,

35:23.541 --> 35:26.249
seek health advice
on the way down.

35:29.708 --> 35:31.624
Fuckin' Wu.

35:32.624 --> 35:35.207
Go on, get back to
your fuckin' alley!

35:46.291 --> 35:48.374
Fuckin' tea, huh?

36:11.374 --> 36:13.082
Am I doing somethin' wrong?

36:16.040 --> 36:18.165
You gimme the fantods,
you're so...

36:18.249 --> 36:20.666
favoring a girl
who once worked here.

36:20.749 --> 36:23.249
Is she thick through
the calf like me?

36:24.165 --> 36:25.583
She's pretty.

36:27.583 --> 36:31.249
She had the yellowest hair.
Just the sweetest damn smile.

36:31.332 --> 36:33.499
She had a chip,
she had...

36:33.583 --> 36:36.915
there, right there, like
to drive a fella crazy.

36:39.040 --> 36:40.749
Me at least, anyway.

36:42.165 --> 36:43.499
Jen...

36:44.374 --> 36:45.749
her name was.

36:46.874 --> 36:48.624
And Jen move along?

36:51.457 --> 36:54.124
She, she did. Uh-huh.

36:56.291 --> 36:57.957
Moved on.

36:59.457 --> 37:01.624
Give you word where?

37:04.332 --> 37:05.957
Uh...

37:06.749 --> 37:09.957
I weren't telling
you true, Caroline.

37:11.749 --> 37:13.207
She died.

37:14.040 --> 37:15.374
Jen did.

37:16.749 --> 37:18.165
Just poor luck...

37:24.165 --> 37:26.583
Caught in the middle
of situation none of her

37:26.666 --> 37:28.040
fuckin' doing.

37:28.833 --> 37:31.124
"Exceptional sweet soul,"

37:31.207 --> 37:32.666
Minister said.

37:33.332 --> 37:34.999
And he weren't wrong.

37:39.249 --> 37:40.457
Appears my job's
in progress

37:40.541 --> 37:42.999
before we might even
get to set down.

37:45.124 --> 37:47.291
Early uprising...

37:47.374 --> 37:49.332
longtime trial to me.

37:54.541 --> 37:56.583
More than an hour late
is Charlie.

37:58.666 --> 38:00.874
Maybe I pressed
too hard about Hearst.

38:01.666 --> 38:04.249
Perhaps he got involved
catching' up with folks.

38:08.124 --> 38:10.165
I should feed the children.

38:15.666 --> 38:17.374
I'm gonna look out for Charlie.

38:26.541 --> 38:28.457
Evening, Marshal!

38:28.541 --> 38:30.332
Looking for
Charlie Utter, Jane.

38:30.666 --> 38:32.332
I ain't seen him tonight.

38:32.416 --> 38:34.165
Do something for me?

38:34.249 --> 38:36.999
Check around town.
If you find Charlie,

38:37.082 --> 38:39.291
tell him my wife's angry
at his bad behavior.

38:39.999 --> 38:42.791
- Count on it!
- Harry, with me.

38:42.874 --> 38:44.666
My gout's agitating.

38:44.749 --> 38:46.832
- Should I take one of the young ones?
- Yes, sir.

38:46.833 --> 38:49.499
- I'll fucking go with you, Bullock.
- No! No!

38:49.583 --> 38:51.583
I'm up! I'm up.

39:11.624 --> 39:13.249
That's Charlie's horse.

39:13.833 --> 39:15.957
Start over there.

39:43.833 --> 39:45.624
Careful now!

39:54.124 --> 39:56.040
How long you
standing out here?

39:56.124 --> 39:58.874
Better part of my
fuckin' life, feels like.

40:00.791 --> 40:03.708
You looking for Charlie
Utter with me or not?

40:03.791 --> 40:06.624
He sometimes plays cards
at this new place.

40:06.708 --> 40:08.108
Only knowed that
'cause I teased him

40:08.165 --> 40:10.291
never frequentin'
this joint.

40:11.124 --> 40:12.541
Lead the way then.

40:18.124 --> 40:19.499
Charlie?

40:21.999 --> 40:23.374
Charlie Utter!

40:24.332 --> 40:25.666
Charlie!

40:34.666 --> 40:36.541
Come out,
hands where I can see 'em.

40:36.624 --> 40:38.249
Don't you shoot.

40:41.915 --> 40:43.541
What are you doing
out here, Samuel?

40:43.833 --> 40:46.583
I'm just reachin'
for my fishing pole,

40:46.999 --> 40:50.374
and I'm askin' you
not to kill me.

40:52.457 --> 40:54.583
Christ.
Charlie!

40:55.915 --> 40:57.374
It weren't me, no sir!

40:57.666 --> 40:59.457
What the fuck
you talkin' about?

40:59.541 --> 41:01.082
Bullock!

41:09.874 --> 41:11.541
Jesus God in Heaven.

41:14.915 --> 41:16.583
Get him a blanket, Harry.

41:17.332 --> 41:19.583
- I didn't do it, Marshal...
- Be still.

42:16.332 --> 42:18.165
I'd appreciate
Mr. Hearst knowing

42:18.249 --> 42:20.040
I'm Waitin'
to talk to him.

42:20.124 --> 42:22.416
- Mr. Utter!
- That can't be!

42:28.374 --> 42:30.165
You see? Covered in blood!

42:50.791 --> 42:53.499
Charlie Utter's dead,
Mr. Hearst.

42:54.165 --> 42:55.833
Murdered.

42:55.915 --> 42:58.541
Do we know by
whose hand, Marshal,

42:58.624 --> 43:00.499
Mr. Utter has been taken?

43:00.583 --> 43:01.915
Who pulled the trigger,

43:01.999 --> 43:04.374
put the fucking money up
to get it done.

43:04.457 --> 43:07.915
I take that, sir, as a slur

43:07.999 --> 43:09.957
meant to incite me.

43:10.040 --> 43:13.082
And I do not choose
to be provoked.

43:14.124 --> 43:17.082
Your imputing
foreknowledge, sir,

43:17.165 --> 43:20.416
to me of Mr. Utter's
murder exposes me

43:20.499 --> 43:24.082
to shameful slander
and disesteem.

43:24.165 --> 43:26.332
I will have you recant.

43:27.374 --> 43:29.624
Or either ready to receive

43:29.708 --> 43:33.082
behavior from me
in rebuke.

43:37.583 --> 43:41.374
What form then do you figure
your rebuke will take,

43:41.791 --> 43:44.165
murdering cunt that you are?

43:44.833 --> 43:47.915
- Bullock...
- I'll get to you in a fuckin' minute.

43:58.124 --> 43:59.624
Charlie Utter.

43:59.708 --> 44:02.416
- - Have a thought
for a good man dead.

44:09.416 --> 44:12.583
Shut the place down.
Bar's closed!

44:13.541 --> 44:14.741
Go on, get the fuck
outta here!

44:21.999 --> 44:23.624
I'd learn the import
of that look

44:23.708 --> 44:25.583
passed twixt you
and fuckin' Hearst.

44:26.416 --> 44:28.374
Get the marshal
a whiskey.

44:30.833 --> 44:32.999
I don't want a fuckin' drink.

44:41.624 --> 44:42.833
Say, Bullock,

44:42.915 --> 44:45.999
a fella, not many hours
left to order his affairs,

44:46.082 --> 44:49.499
applied them that remained,
naming such

44:49.583 --> 44:52.833
purposes that
he'd give primacy.

44:52.915 --> 44:55.165
Deal me in
or don't, Al.

44:55.249 --> 44:58.124
I'd not be fucked
halfway up.

45:03.749 --> 45:06.833
Hearst stopped by,
wanted to bury the hatchet.

45:08.040 --> 45:09.291
Pool revenue and influence

45:09.374 --> 45:11.457
in exchange
for Trixie's life.

45:12.082 --> 45:15.874
Planning to run telephone
wires across Utter's property.

45:16.915 --> 45:19.791
Lumber lies at his claim.

45:19.874 --> 45:22.791
Him conveying that to you,
you said fuckin' what?

45:23.708 --> 45:26.624
- I let the offer sit.
- To what fucking end?

45:30.291 --> 45:34.124
You ever think, Bullock,
of not going straight at a thing?

45:35.874 --> 45:37.207
No.

45:40.624 --> 45:42.291
What's the move, Al?

45:44.165 --> 45:46.165
Wish the fuck I knew.

45:48.624 --> 45:51.791
Killing Charlie Utter
changes the game.

45:56.416 --> 45:59.165
Say the man has an eyewitness
to bring to bear.

46:00.332 --> 46:01.666
Name him.

46:02.374 --> 46:04.082
Samuel Fields.

46:04.666 --> 46:06.874
The Nigger General was
an eyewitness to what?

46:06.957 --> 46:09.791
Eyewitness to them
as did for Charlie Utter.

46:10.124 --> 46:13.583
And thereby need a good
fuckin' murdering.

46:15.374 --> 46:17.583
Sidestepping legal
administration.

46:17.666 --> 46:19.498
Well, if it ain't for
Hearst to follow the law,

46:19.499 --> 46:21.374
why the fuck
should it be for you?

46:23.957 --> 46:28.165
Now, how should I construe
that look on your mug, Bullock?

46:28.915 --> 46:31.666
My job ain't to
follow the law, Al.

46:32.499 --> 46:35.124
My job is to
interpret it,

46:35.207 --> 46:38.416
then enforce it...
accordingly.

46:42.957 --> 46:46.499
You best counsel
your partner proper,

46:46.583 --> 46:48.749
the safety of
mother and child.

46:49.457 --> 46:51.291
Sol and me'll see to it.

46:51.374 --> 46:52.791
Hearst won't take long

46:52.874 --> 46:56.207
before he honors the rigors
of his putrid fuckin' nature.

46:56.374 --> 46:58.541
He'll want an answer.

47:01.332 --> 47:03.666
I'll deliver your
fuckin' answer.

47:35.583 --> 47:37.999
Fuckin' telephone
in my joint.

47:40.165 --> 47:43.499
Saloon is a sanctuary.

47:43.583 --> 47:44.999
Every man worth the name

47:45.082 --> 47:47.999
knows the value
of being unreachable.

47:48.249 --> 47:51.291
Will you have me suck your
prick now, Mr. Swearengen?

47:51.374 --> 47:54.583
What has changed since early
when I declined the offer?

47:54.666 --> 47:58.374
Do I look suddenly robust,
unimpededly erect?

47:58.457 --> 48:00.457
I am out,
as I told you,

48:00.541 --> 48:03.249
of sorts,
commission, activity.

48:03.332 --> 48:04.956
And more and more
forgetful what the whole

48:04.957 --> 48:07.624
sordid fuckin'
business is to signify.

48:08.874 --> 48:11.040
Plenty I wouldn't
mind forgetting.

48:23.165 --> 48:25.791
Hey, come over here. Come on.

48:30.999 --> 48:33.957
You dropped
this earlier.

48:36.583 --> 48:39.165
Real or not, I value it high.

48:39.541 --> 48:41.915
That is a goddamn
gold commemorative

48:41.999 --> 48:44.332
worth 12 to $14.

48:48.915 --> 48:51.416
Can I ask who the woman
was earlier today,

48:51.499 --> 48:53.207
yelling from
the hotel balcony?

48:54.124 --> 48:56.332
One who ain't afraid to die.

48:56.915 --> 48:58.749
And who
you'd see live?

48:58.833 --> 49:00.082
Well, that's the question.

49:00.165 --> 49:01.708
When I'm gone,
who'll protect her?

49:01.791 --> 49:05.165
Can the Jew do what needs
to be done? Can Bullock?

49:07.499 --> 49:09.207
Oh Christ, save me.

49:09.541 --> 49:11.708
Have I feelings for her?

49:13.624 --> 49:17.374
Am I that fuckin' lost
a cunt, a man my age?

49:18.666 --> 49:20.666
Makes me wanna weep,

49:21.541 --> 49:23.666
how you remind me of my dad.

49:24.082 --> 49:27.374
Don't you hang your
relations around my neck.

49:42.874 --> 49:44.874
It's a sad night.

49:47.457 --> 49:49.416
Something's afire.

49:51.791 --> 49:52.874
Christ.

49:54.999 --> 49:57.207
I do have feelings.

50:06.249 --> 50:08.124
Hyah! Hyah!

50:20.082 --> 50:21.249
Hup!

51:03.207 --> 51:04.999
Charlie Utter.

51:05.082 --> 51:08.040
So much to rounding up
Trixie for me.

51:08.957 --> 51:13.165
Well last night, you sent little
Wu with a notion to abstain!

51:13.457 --> 51:14.666
Did I now?

51:15.957 --> 51:18.708
Doc is not 100% all the way
to the top persuaded

51:18.791 --> 51:20.391
that you oughta be up
and about just yet.

51:20.416 --> 51:23.207
Doc's got a call to his
own fuckin' opinion,

51:23.291 --> 51:25.624
but not to be blabbin'

51:25.708 --> 51:27.749
about what pertains
or ain't

51:27.833 --> 51:30.040
to my fuckin' plans, huh?!

51:30.124 --> 51:32.583
Fucking drenched.

51:32.666 --> 51:33.583
Oh!

51:33.666 --> 51:35.874
What are you doing up, Al?!

51:36.249 --> 51:38.999
Well, this is fucking
pain in the balls.

51:40.957 --> 51:42.708
Jesus Christ!

51:45.583 --> 51:48.541
I owe Charlie Utter
a sending off, Doc.

51:49.332 --> 51:51.499
Oh, goddamn it, Al.

51:53.666 --> 51:54.749
Okay.

51:55.541 --> 51:56.999
Hey, Dan!

51:57.082 --> 51:58.457
You do it, huh?

51:58.874 --> 52:00.874
Handful of dirt
from each of us?

52:02.332 --> 52:04.291
Charlie Utter.

52:04.374 --> 52:06.457
You got to walk it

52:06.541 --> 52:09.291
<i>♪ by yourself ♪</i>

52:09.374 --> 52:10.999
<i>♪ There's nobody else... ♪</i>

52:11.082 --> 52:13.124
Mr. Utter's
accustomed to letting me cross

52:13.207 --> 52:14.708
his land and fish the stream

52:14.791 --> 52:17.499
that separates his acres
from Mr. Hearst.

52:18.124 --> 52:21.666
He come 'round about a quarter
past the second I caught,

52:21.749 --> 52:23.457
me expecting
his purpose to

52:23.541 --> 52:24.915
ask how I was faring.

52:27.874 --> 52:30.915
I heard a rifle
shot, and took the fuck off.

52:30.999 --> 52:33.457
Could you identify
the man who did it?

52:33.541 --> 52:36.040
No, sir, I cannot.

52:37.207 --> 52:39.207
Because I didn't see him.

52:43.749 --> 52:44.957
You being you?

52:45.040 --> 52:47.833
Me being the color
I am, yes, sir.

52:47.915 --> 52:49.291
I wish I could.

52:54.291 --> 52:56.874
I'ma say this once
to you, Marshal.

52:56.957 --> 52:58.666
I'm gonna let myself hope

52:58.749 --> 53:00.331
that you don't permit
'em stringing me up

53:00.332 --> 53:03.124
over something I had nothing
to do with, not fuck all.

53:03.207 --> 53:06.249
Nobody's trying to lynch you
at this moment here, Samuel.

53:07.416 --> 53:09.416
And if you look
at me hard,

53:10.082 --> 53:11.207
you'll know

53:11.291 --> 53:13.040
they'll have to kill me
down the road

53:13.124 --> 53:14.708
before they get to do it then.

53:17.374 --> 53:19.666
Bless you seeing
clear to say so, Marshal,

53:19.749 --> 53:21.624
and get me a good
goddamn lawyer.

53:21.708 --> 53:24.499
Sorry for the lateness.
Gout's flaring.

53:24.583 --> 53:25.874
Was at the Doc's.

53:25.957 --> 53:28.291
Been hearing about your
gout a lot lately, Harry.

53:28.374 --> 53:31.457
Pokes me like devil's in there
working with a tiny pitchfork.

53:31.541 --> 53:32.541
How's this going?

53:32.624 --> 53:34.708
Get me a good

54:20.708 --> 54:23.499
Come on, Jane.
Time for Charlie's burial.

54:38.416 --> 54:40.207
Remember when Bill passed?

54:41.082 --> 54:43.583
Charlie so broke up
he'd been out the camp,

54:43.666 --> 54:45.332
couldn't attend
the goodbye?

54:46.833 --> 54:48.749
And I recollect,
too, girl barely

54:48.833 --> 54:50.332
could put one foot
front the other

54:50.416 --> 54:53.583
but weren't gonna fail
to see Bill Hickok off.

54:56.749 --> 55:00.082
When Sol Star and
I came to this community,

55:00.708 --> 55:02.165
Charlie Utter...

55:02.249 --> 55:05.499
was first man forward
offering his hand in greeting.

55:06.666 --> 55:09.332
Over time,
Sol and I formed a...

55:09.416 --> 55:11.708
friendship with Charlie.

55:11.999 --> 55:13.999
Enriched our lives.

55:14.291 --> 55:17.874
Come up to proper,
he was good-natured and just.

55:19.541 --> 55:20.708
Come to any way at all,

55:20.791 --> 55:23.249
I never saw a man
stand him down.

55:24.708 --> 55:26.040
Only right

55:26.124 --> 55:29.416
he should be buried on the land
he worked his life for.

55:31.541 --> 55:34.374
Charlie was took
from us wrongful,

55:34.457 --> 55:36.124
and he was...

55:38.416 --> 55:40.082
He was took too soon.

55:42.499 --> 55:43.666
We ask respite

55:43.749 --> 55:46.499
for a good man's soul.

55:46.583 --> 55:48.999
Pray the Lord
carry him home.

55:51.624 --> 55:55.124
No man never stood up
for me how Charlie did,

55:56.249 --> 55:58.915
nor with no word 'bout
doing it, neither.

56:00.666 --> 56:02.833
Amen.

56:02.915 --> 56:04.374
Amen to that.

56:27.457 --> 56:28.708
Gentlemen.

56:28.791 --> 56:30.957
Senator Hearst
expecting us.

56:32.124 --> 56:33.499
Room number nine.

56:35.874 --> 56:38.957
Constituents of the
cocksucker from California?

56:39.040 --> 56:41.207
Don't I deserve
common courtesy?

56:43.791 --> 56:47.457
May I mention service
as this community's mayor,

56:47.541 --> 56:51.291
albeit admittedly
a largely titular position.

56:52.332 --> 56:54.499
But, facts are facts.

57:01.583 --> 57:05.833
Well deserved, if modest,
recognitions, gentlemen.

57:07.374 --> 57:08.624
Jobs well done.

57:08.708 --> 57:10.207
Well, if you call
them recognitions

57:10.291 --> 57:11.583
just modest,
Mr. Hearst,

57:11.666 --> 57:13.249
I pray to Christ
we run across you

57:13.332 --> 57:14.749
the day you're showing off.

57:14.833 --> 57:17.040
Certain you were unseen?

57:17.124 --> 57:19.332
Not a human eye
for miles.

57:20.082 --> 57:22.915
Man looks to be losing his mind, Dennis.

57:25.249 --> 57:27.291
- That direction.
- What the fuck?

57:29.499 --> 57:30.541
Hm.

57:31.249 --> 57:33.207
I saw a fisherman
at the claim

57:33.666 --> 57:35.082
earlier in the day.

57:35.165 --> 57:37.165
Dark-complected fellow,

57:37.249 --> 57:38.499
wading the stream.

57:46.624 --> 57:48.749
You bring me to wonder
aloud if that last

57:48.833 --> 57:50.749
was a bald-faced
fabrication.

57:51.207 --> 57:52.541
My sources say Marshal's

57:52.624 --> 57:55.374
collected a witness,
for a fact.

57:57.207 --> 57:58.457
I paid for execution

57:58.541 --> 58:01.749
at a level of
professional excellence.

58:07.541 --> 58:09.291
You were commissioned...

58:10.332 --> 58:13.249
to undertake of
certain effort.

58:13.791 --> 58:16.124
It went without
saying that

58:16.207 --> 58:18.915
you would address
any complications

58:18.999 --> 58:21.332
that might ensue.

58:21.416 --> 58:23.666
Part of the contract,
sir, yes.

58:25.165 --> 58:28.416
They have someone in custody,

58:28.499 --> 58:31.708
which fails,
by a considerable margin,

58:31.791 --> 58:33.915
to please me.

58:33.999 --> 58:35.957
I strongly suggest
you handle it.

58:36.040 --> 58:39.165
How the fuck are we supposed to
get into the marshal's office?

58:39.249 --> 58:42.124
Check on the veracity
of this claim?

58:43.541 --> 58:47.416
My sources are to be trusted,
it won't be easy.

58:47.499 --> 58:50.249
But, neither will
it be impossible.

58:51.416 --> 58:52.499
Uh-huh.

58:53.583 --> 58:54.915
I see.

58:58.124 --> 59:00.124
This further business,

59:00.207 --> 59:02.374
if successfully
brought to fruition,

59:02.457 --> 59:04.416
will earn each of you...

59:05.957 --> 59:08.124
$50 additional.

59:08.791 --> 59:10.749
Well, now we're talkin'.

59:11.291 --> 59:14.541
- The Negro fisherman?
- That'd be a job well done.

59:16.874 --> 59:18.666
Judas Priest!

59:29.624 --> 59:32.957
A word with you, Mr. Farnum!

59:35.040 --> 59:38.541
Property of mine fell
victim to arson last night.

59:38.624 --> 59:40.915
So, Senator,
I'm gave to understand.

59:40.999 --> 59:42.499
What dreadful news.

59:43.457 --> 59:45.291
Place this lumber order.

59:45.374 --> 59:47.082
The vendor is in Lead.

59:47.165 --> 59:48.457
Tell the man

59:48.541 --> 59:51.624
weekly deliveries
until further notice.

59:51.708 --> 59:52.999
By telegraph, sir?

59:54.124 --> 59:57.833
There is a public
telephone just outside.

59:57.915 --> 59:59.708
Take the leap, Mr. Farnum.

59:59.791 --> 01:00:01.666
The future awaits.

01:00:01.749 --> 01:00:04.332
The queue,
sir, stretches.

01:00:04.416 --> 01:00:06.749
Have you seen
the riffraff lined up?

01:00:06.833 --> 01:00:09.082
Stall progress he may.

01:00:09.165 --> 01:00:11.207
Stop it he cannot.

01:00:12.416 --> 01:00:13.957
Every business,
Mr. Farnum,

01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:15.915
in this
territory thrives

01:00:15.999 --> 01:00:18.874
as a direct result
of communication.

01:00:19.624 --> 01:00:22.124
Now, we've no say
as to the pace

01:00:22.207 --> 01:00:24.708
of modernity's advance.

01:00:24.791 --> 01:00:27.791
I myself am merely...
its vessel.

01:00:27.915 --> 01:00:30.291
A humble foot soldier.

01:00:30.374 --> 01:00:33.082
Its inevitability is
the deepest truth...

01:00:33.165 --> 01:00:35.457
What is wrong with you,
goddamn it, to be

01:00:35.541 --> 01:00:37.957
shifting your feet
so incessantly?

01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:40.124
Uh, the procession of years,

01:00:40.207 --> 01:00:41.457
wanton leakage.

01:00:41.541 --> 01:00:43.624
You are a vile creature.

01:00:43.708 --> 01:00:46.124
Nor are you first to say so.

01:00:46.207 --> 01:00:48.583
Get the hell out
and place the call.

01:00:48.666 --> 01:00:51.207
I'll detain you for
the briefest moment.

01:00:51.291 --> 01:00:53.457
- Now.
- Yes, sir. Going.

01:01:02.833 --> 01:01:05.624
Peaches, Jewel,
are for meeting of the town elders.

01:01:05.708 --> 01:01:07.508
This prospect here before
us, it's an auction.

01:01:07.583 --> 01:01:09.624
It's hardly the same
fuckin' thing.

01:01:09.708 --> 01:01:13.416
God, you think about ever
getting yourself a hobby, Dan?

01:01:13.499 --> 01:01:15.373
And that smart-ass mouth
of your'n is gonna get you

01:01:15.374 --> 01:01:17.541
relegated back to
the fucking kitchen.

01:01:18.082 --> 01:01:19.874
Futile to go
to Hearst this way.

01:01:19.957 --> 01:01:22.666
No matter his resources,
but it'd be a pity

01:01:22.749 --> 01:01:24.583
not to recognize
what's at stake.

01:01:24.666 --> 01:01:27.040
To go ahead
and die stupid.

01:01:27.124 --> 01:01:30.249
Hate to end a fool, right?

01:01:31.708 --> 01:01:34.165
Sure as hell
Charlie Utter didn't.

01:01:35.249 --> 01:01:38.583
What's essential is you
remember, do your part.

01:01:38.833 --> 01:01:41.915
Oh, naught else, Marshal?
Laundry required?

01:01:42.541 --> 01:01:43.915
I'll let you know.

01:01:45.416 --> 01:01:47.082
Where you been, Bullock?

01:01:49.416 --> 01:01:51.082
Right up the fuckin' road, Al.

01:02:02.833 --> 01:02:04.457
God damn it!

01:02:06.624 --> 01:02:07.708
Goddamn it.

01:02:07.791 --> 01:02:10.541
My goodness. A voice?

01:02:10.624 --> 01:02:13.291
Hello, in there.

01:02:13.957 --> 01:02:17.040
I'm calling
the town of Lead!

01:02:18.624 --> 01:02:21.749
It's Deadwood's mayor,
E.B. Farnum, relegated to

01:02:21.833 --> 01:02:25.165
magnate-Senator
George Hearst's errand boy,

01:02:25.249 --> 01:02:28.583
calling Lead Lumber
at the senator's behest.

01:02:31.374 --> 01:02:34.791
The Negro will lay slain
before this concludes.

01:02:35.207 --> 01:02:37.666
Christ. I must get to Bullock.

01:02:39.874 --> 01:02:41.749
Good afternoon
and welcome to

01:02:41.833 --> 01:02:43.708
the Utter estates dispersal,

01:02:43.791 --> 01:02:45.249
as will proceed

01:02:45.332 --> 01:02:48.374
under the supervision
of the Deadwood Bank.

01:02:48.457 --> 01:02:51.541
A description of the parcel
and its dimensions

01:02:51.624 --> 01:02:54.165
are detailed in
the available literature.

01:02:54.249 --> 01:02:57.708
First bids on landholdings
of Charlie Utter,

01:02:57.791 --> 01:03:00.291
Deadwood Bank the fiduciary,

01:03:00.374 --> 01:03:02.082
to commence at $2,500,

01:03:02.165 --> 01:03:05.999
increments thereafter of
$100 above the previous bid.

01:03:06.833 --> 01:03:09.583
I'm not made for
such complexity.

01:03:10.957 --> 01:03:13.749
Who will open now
on parcel one

01:03:13.833 --> 01:03:16.207
at $2,500?

01:03:18.374 --> 01:03:20.791
I've a bid for $2,500

01:03:20.874 --> 01:03:22.541
on the regrettably
deceased Mr. Utter's

01:03:22.624 --> 01:03:24.791
very desirable property.

01:03:24.874 --> 01:03:27.666
Who will go with me now to 26?

01:03:27.874 --> 01:03:30.124
- $2,600.
- Backing your play, partner.

01:03:30.207 --> 01:03:31.708
Conservative proffer.

01:03:32.957 --> 01:03:34.999
Uh, $2,700.

01:03:35.374 --> 01:03:38.082
Upon which Hearst takes
matters by the neck.

01:03:38.165 --> 01:03:39.291
3,000.

01:03:41.165 --> 01:03:44.249
Nor do I lack for
stronger opinions.

01:03:46.457 --> 01:03:48.541
- 3,100.
- 32.

01:03:48.791 --> 01:03:51.374
Rode in, did you, Marshal,
on a Trojan horse?

01:03:52.708 --> 01:03:54.957
Floor's heard $3,200.

01:03:55.040 --> 01:03:56.332
3,300, please.

01:03:56.416 --> 01:03:59.541
34. And if
you know your limit, Marshal,

01:03:59.624 --> 01:04:02.999
let's hurry and get to it
so that I may get us past,

01:04:03.082 --> 01:04:06.791
and that we all of us
can sup at a decent hour.

01:04:10.583 --> 01:04:12.666
3,400's heard once.

01:04:12.749 --> 01:04:14.124
3,500.

01:04:14.207 --> 01:04:16.040
Terrible fire at your
claim last night.

01:04:16.124 --> 01:04:17.791
Everybody whole,

01:04:17.874 --> 01:04:19.332
- Senator?
- 36.

01:04:21.666 --> 01:04:23.666
3,700.

01:04:27.374 --> 01:04:28.457
38.

01:04:31.999 --> 01:04:33.666
3,900.

01:04:33.749 --> 01:04:36.915
I've 3,900 once.

01:04:44.624 --> 01:04:46.541
Mr. Hearst sent us.

01:04:46.624 --> 01:04:48.291
It's fuckin' daytime.

01:04:48.374 --> 01:04:50.040
Not our fuckin' problem.

01:04:50.791 --> 01:04:52.999
Say how you
want it played.

01:04:53.082 --> 01:04:55.624
Key's on the desk,
this side of my head.

01:04:59.499 --> 01:05:01.541
- 4,300.
- 44.

01:05:03.874 --> 01:05:06.999
- Seth...
- Do I hear 4,500?

01:05:07.082 --> 01:05:09.207
5,000, goddamn it.

01:05:09.291 --> 01:05:11.999
As ought shoo
the sightseers off.

01:05:12.624 --> 01:05:14.791
- 5,500.
- 56.

01:05:16.874 --> 01:05:17.874
6,000.

01:05:17.915 --> 01:05:20.165
6,500.

01:05:25.666 --> 01:05:27.082
$7,000.

01:05:34.124 --> 01:05:35.708
7,200.

01:05:36.915 --> 01:05:39.165
$7,300.

01:05:39.624 --> 01:05:41.249
And neither,
if you continue, sir,

01:05:41.332 --> 01:05:43.583
will you find yourself
unaccompanied.

01:05:48.583 --> 01:05:51.207
I've $7,300

01:05:51.291 --> 01:05:54.332
for the Utter
property heard once.

01:05:57.207 --> 01:05:58.833
7,300 twice.

01:06:00.624 --> 01:06:03.124
Third time.

01:06:03.207 --> 01:06:04.791
Sold to the distinguished

01:06:04.874 --> 01:06:07.165
and resourceful
Mrs. Ellsworth,

01:06:07.249 --> 01:06:09.499
for $7,300!

01:06:13.541 --> 01:06:14.708
Mrs. Ellsworth.

01:06:32.457 --> 01:06:34.457
You honored Charlie today.

01:06:35.749 --> 01:06:36.957
Bullock!

01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:38.583
Excuse me.

01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:40.708
What is it, E.B.?

01:06:43.207 --> 01:06:44.957
- You're certain?
- Yes.

01:06:50.708 --> 01:06:51.791
Dan.

01:06:52.874 --> 01:06:54.791
- With Al.
- Staying.

01:07:00.915 --> 01:07:01.915
No!

01:07:01.957 --> 01:07:03.791
Oh!

01:07:17.291 --> 01:07:18.291
Sorry.

01:07:18.833 --> 01:07:20.874
How long ago?

01:07:20.957 --> 01:07:23.082
I couldn't tell you
for a mortal truth.

01:07:26.082 --> 01:07:27.666
- They got Samuel.
- Marshal!

01:07:27.749 --> 01:07:30.708
Come! Something bad
is happening! Come!

01:07:30.791 --> 01:07:33.499
Come! Come here!

01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.291
Lemme go, the chink lives.

01:07:54.207 --> 01:07:56.374
Mengyao! Mengyao!

01:07:57.457 --> 01:07:59.332
You're gonna die
you do that.

01:08:00.082 --> 01:08:01.791
You arresting me
for beating a coon

01:08:01.874 --> 01:08:03.666
murdered a decent
white man?

01:08:04.207 --> 01:08:07.541
- You murdered Charlie Utter.
- Aye? And who says so?

01:08:07.624 --> 01:08:09.082
I...

01:08:09.666 --> 01:08:11.249
I say so.

01:08:12.332 --> 01:08:13.999
That's him, Bullock.

01:08:14.624 --> 01:08:16.249
Killed your friend.

01:08:31.207 --> 01:08:32.832
Seth.

01:08:33.832 --> 01:08:36.082
Seth! Seth!

01:08:37.999 --> 01:08:39.791
Don't kill him!

01:08:45.291 --> 01:08:46.416
Take care of Samuel.

01:08:47.707 --> 01:08:50.957
Wu, feed that fuck to the pigs.

01:09:06.332 --> 01:09:09.040
George Hearst! Come out!

01:09:19.499 --> 01:09:21.374
George Hearst!

01:09:21.457 --> 01:09:22.791
Come out now!

01:09:51.207 --> 01:09:54.499
Identify the man hired you
to do Charlie Utter's murder.

01:09:57.624 --> 01:10:00.249
Finally lost your grip,
Marshal.

01:10:03.749 --> 01:10:05.416
Name the man! Go on!

01:10:07.499 --> 01:10:09.583
Point him out.

01:10:22.457 --> 01:10:23.833
He hired us.

01:10:25.749 --> 01:10:27.291
Who did?

01:10:42.666 --> 01:10:45.124
Set up, Marshal, are we?

01:10:45.457 --> 01:10:48.207
Justice and mercy
in proper relation.

01:10:48.291 --> 01:10:49.666
Feelin' more a man?

01:10:50.249 --> 01:10:52.874
Better lock the next
shipment of lumber up.

01:10:54.416 --> 01:10:56.749
I expect you believe a badge

01:10:56.833 --> 01:11:00.332
insulates you from certain
untoward consequences.

01:11:01.999 --> 01:11:04.165
Much as your being
a US senator

01:11:04.249 --> 01:11:06.332
will insulate you from jail.

01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.833
Tell this cocksucker
to lower his weapon!

01:11:15.457 --> 01:11:17.416
Inside, now.

01:11:23.499 --> 01:11:25.165
Fuckin' shot, I am!

01:11:25.249 --> 01:11:26.583
You'll fuckin' live.

01:11:30.165 --> 01:11:31.999
Johnny...

01:11:34.165 --> 01:11:38.291
Congratulations on
the rising body count.

01:11:39.374 --> 01:11:41.207
Ain't proud of it.

01:11:41.624 --> 01:11:43.666
I'm coming for you, Marshal.

01:11:43.749 --> 01:11:45.791
Expect you will, Senator.

01:12:05.999 --> 01:12:08.040
Mr. Hearst?

01:12:38.749 --> 01:12:40.915
Hold your son.

01:12:40.999 --> 01:12:42.874
Rock him towards sleep.
Feed him his milk

01:12:42.957 --> 01:12:44.249
I've squoze into his bottles.

01:12:44.332 --> 01:12:46.081
Clean and change him when
he does his business.

01:12:46.082 --> 01:12:47.791
Wait, Trixie,
where are you going?

01:12:47.874 --> 01:12:50.332
First, Al's urgent
call to see me.

01:12:50.416 --> 01:12:53.457
Then, he sends this note
sayin' the opposite.

01:12:56.082 --> 01:12:58.165
What the fuck, Sol?

01:12:58.249 --> 01:12:59.666
Not mine.

01:12:59.749 --> 01:13:01.708
Collateral damage is all.

01:13:02.207 --> 01:13:03.499
Well, whose fucking
blood is it?

01:13:03.583 --> 01:13:06.040
Men who murdered
Charlie, dead now.

01:13:06.124 --> 01:13:09.249
- Oh, the Hebrew takes to arms!
- Trixie, please calm down.

01:13:09.332 --> 01:13:11.207
Then, take him.

01:13:11.291 --> 01:13:12.791
- No.
- For God's sakes.

01:13:18.999 --> 01:13:20.833
I'm getting
Al's counsel.

01:13:20.915 --> 01:13:22.624
With our baby stood
with his father,

01:13:22.708 --> 01:13:25.457
20 possible minutes
or a fucking cunt hair more.

01:13:27.124 --> 01:13:29.291
I'll exit back
of the hotel,

01:13:29.374 --> 01:13:31.207
sneaky as a mouse,

01:13:31.291 --> 01:13:33.082
and enter the Gem a side way.

01:13:33.332 --> 01:13:35.874
Being stupid
and fuckin' reckless.

01:13:35.957 --> 01:13:38.040
As I may be both,
you Jew bastard,

01:13:38.124 --> 01:13:40.291
to get out
the fuckin' door.

01:14:15.708 --> 01:14:17.999
Beatin' you about head
and shoulders, lad?

01:14:20.708 --> 01:14:23.457
Their's the upper
hand just now.

01:14:36.791 --> 01:14:40.374
Some choice, making your
presence known to Hearst.

01:14:46.624 --> 01:14:48.624
Whatever trouble I caused...

01:14:49.624 --> 01:14:52.374
blame the baby's
imminent arrival.

01:14:53.583 --> 01:14:57.708
I took that young girl's
life to save yours.

01:14:58.915 --> 01:15:01.124
Please, Al,
don't say it again.

01:15:02.541 --> 01:15:04.999
Haunts me,
Jen's face does.

01:15:06.249 --> 01:15:08.666
Weren't you
cut her throat,

01:15:08.749 --> 01:15:12.416
nor devised a fuckin' plan
that nearly got us all killed.

01:15:15.291 --> 01:15:17.291
God have mercy on me.

01:15:19.291 --> 01:15:22.165
I don't deserve the one
fuckin' minute of happiness,

01:15:22.249 --> 01:15:24.165
my newborn gave me
coming into the world.

01:15:24.249 --> 01:15:27.124
We chose you,
you loopy cunt.

01:15:27.207 --> 01:15:28.999
Look at the fuckin'
mess you've give us.

01:15:29.082 --> 01:15:31.082
I'm un-fucking-worthy, Al!

01:15:32.249 --> 01:15:34.666
I belonged in that
coffin, not her!

01:15:34.749 --> 01:15:36.291
Well, if your aim
was to die, please,

01:15:36.374 --> 01:15:38.583
allow me to do the honors.

01:15:46.708 --> 01:15:50.541
We're all of us haunted by
our own fucking thoughts,

01:15:50.624 --> 01:15:52.416
so make friends
with her ghost!

01:15:52.499 --> 01:15:54.957
It ain't going
fuckin' anywhere!

01:16:13.457 --> 01:16:15.040
I'm sorry...

01:16:16.124 --> 01:16:17.291
for everything.

01:16:19.541 --> 01:16:21.332
Heavens open up.

01:16:21.416 --> 01:16:24.124
She expresses contrition.

01:16:37.165 --> 01:16:39.332
New baby in camp?

01:16:40.791 --> 01:16:42.541
Lovely little boy.

01:16:47.624 --> 01:16:50.332
As born of his mother,
he would be.

01:16:56.040 --> 01:16:57.708
Did you try and stop
her from leaving?

01:16:57.791 --> 01:17:00.249
- Nothing I could do.
- Jesus Christ.

01:17:03.583 --> 01:17:05.124
Swearengen's
the only one I told

01:17:05.207 --> 01:17:06.708
Samuel's in the cage.

01:17:07.708 --> 01:17:11.416
Man may be a lot of things,
but he's not a snitch.

01:17:11.499 --> 01:17:12.874
State he's in,
more likely

01:17:12.957 --> 01:17:15.124
fuckin' forgot
the conversation entirely.

01:17:21.541 --> 01:17:24.583
Too much ask you stay
the hell outta trouble?

01:17:28.666 --> 01:17:30.249
No, fuckin' Bullock.

01:17:30.915 --> 01:17:32.416
Not too much.

01:17:34.666 --> 01:17:36.040
I will.

01:17:45.708 --> 01:17:47.874
Not himself, Al weren't.

01:17:49.708 --> 01:17:51.291
Weak like I never seen him.

01:17:53.457 --> 01:17:55.457
Gather some things now.

01:17:56.583 --> 01:17:59.082
We're spending the night
at the Bullock house.

01:18:00.082 --> 01:18:02.791
Moving us from
the center of town.

01:18:04.249 --> 01:18:05.957
Hate runnin' from him, Sol.

01:18:07.416 --> 01:18:08.999
For our boy.

01:18:22.416 --> 01:18:24.666
What are the
odds him comin' to?

01:18:28.833 --> 01:18:32.082
He's severely injured
from the beating.

01:18:32.957 --> 01:18:34.708
Spleen's ruptured.

01:18:35.791 --> 01:18:37.624
Blood in his belly.

01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.708
Odds on it ending?

01:18:42.124 --> 01:18:45.332
All bleeding
stops eventually.

01:19:09.374 --> 01:19:11.791
We ought marry on
the morrow, Sol.

01:19:14.124 --> 01:19:16.583
Al ain't to be
relied on to linger.

01:19:21.957 --> 01:19:25.124
And we ain't exchangin'
secret fuckin' vows,

01:19:25.207 --> 01:19:27.374
tucked away in hiding.

01:19:30.624 --> 01:19:32.749
Free all day.

01:20:19.999 --> 01:20:21.583
Oh, well done.

01:20:22.833 --> 01:20:24.874
Proud performance.

01:20:24.957 --> 01:20:27.124
Fuckin' pissed myself.

01:20:44.666 --> 01:20:46.999
Twenty minutes going
forward to the ceremony,

01:20:47.082 --> 01:20:50.165
nor neither the same
interval afterwards.

01:20:50.249 --> 01:20:52.957
No fornication
on the premises.

01:21:01.165 --> 01:21:03.332
Why does she
get to hold him?

01:21:04.583 --> 01:21:05.666
Because I'm the bride,

01:21:05.749 --> 01:21:07.708
and it's my special fuckin' day.

01:21:09.541 --> 01:21:11.583
Lend fucking hands, girls!

01:21:13.332 --> 01:21:15.249
Make the place
presentable.

01:21:15.583 --> 01:21:18.165
May make that girl my wife.

01:21:18.791 --> 01:21:21.624
She ain't gonna marry no man
age enough to be her daddy.

01:21:22.624 --> 01:21:24.708
Soft hands
smoothed my brow.

01:21:24.791 --> 01:21:26.833
Wrist smelling like jasmine.

01:21:26.915 --> 01:21:29.583
She sewed the hole
in my shoulder closed

01:21:29.666 --> 01:21:31.541
with needle and thread, mm-hmm.

01:21:31.624 --> 01:21:33.541
Lift your wallet
while she's doing it?

01:21:33.624 --> 01:21:35.791
That's a dark view
of the world, Dan.

01:21:37.291 --> 01:21:39.583
I ask to be
enlightened as to

01:21:39.666 --> 01:21:43.791
the passage of spirit
in prospect for me, Doc.

01:21:46.457 --> 01:21:48.040
Well...

01:21:48.124 --> 01:21:51.499
I take us to be
collections of cells,

01:21:51.583 --> 01:21:53.874
each aggregate
a smaller,

01:21:53.957 --> 01:21:56.666
separate life
inside us, and...

01:21:57.624 --> 01:22:00.291
and time slows.

01:22:01.833 --> 01:22:03.999
And finally stops.

01:22:06.165 --> 01:22:07.957
The fate my
cell collections

01:22:08.040 --> 01:22:09.874
live into as we speak.

01:22:11.374 --> 01:22:14.666
That ain't so to
a mortal certainty, Al.

01:22:15.708 --> 01:22:19.291
I'd not prolong
the chewing up, Doc,

01:22:19.374 --> 01:22:21.749
nor the being spat out.

01:22:21.833 --> 01:22:23.708
Not go out a cunt.

01:22:25.165 --> 01:22:27.291
It's the dispatch
I find inglorious.

01:22:27.374 --> 01:22:31.249
The whole delusory
fucking self-importance.

01:22:36.082 --> 01:22:39.957
- Is it your hope to attend the wedding?
- It's my resolve.

01:22:40.040 --> 01:22:41.416
All right then.

01:22:44.082 --> 01:22:45.708
Pucker up.

01:22:54.457 --> 01:22:56.124
I'll take him.

01:22:57.999 --> 01:23:00.040
Believe you were
born to be a whore?

01:23:02.249 --> 01:23:04.249
Probably doing
what I'm fit for.

01:23:04.332 --> 01:23:06.249
How hard you suppose
the bastard turned you out

01:23:06.332 --> 01:23:08.541
had to work to make
you think that?

01:23:12.833 --> 01:23:14.416
Trixie.

01:23:14.957 --> 01:23:16.624
Got an appointment
upstairs.

01:23:26.708 --> 01:23:28.749
Oh, well, I hope you're proud,

01:23:28.833 --> 01:23:30.999
expelling your
sneeze in my mug.

01:23:32.999 --> 01:23:36.165
That's the Lord's blessing
come upon you, Al.

01:23:36.249 --> 01:23:38.499
That's him leanin' down
to kiss your cheek.

01:23:39.791 --> 01:23:40.791
Yeah.

01:23:46.207 --> 01:23:49.165
Well, I ain't got
no time left for

01:23:49.249 --> 01:23:51.040
fancy dancin'.

01:23:51.124 --> 01:23:54.082
Your thoughts on me
leaving you the joint?

01:24:00.207 --> 01:24:02.583
No, not being either to say

01:24:02.666 --> 01:24:04.666
you have to run women.

01:24:04.749 --> 01:24:07.291
I strongly endorse that.

01:24:07.374 --> 01:24:09.457
Make it a dance hall
for all of me.

01:24:14.207 --> 01:24:16.040
What about the circus
elephants, Al,

01:24:16.124 --> 01:24:18.374
producing some
novel effect?

01:24:18.457 --> 01:24:21.457
Dance hall, Trixie,
ain't a bad idea.

01:24:21.541 --> 01:24:23.708
Good man
you got there!

01:24:23.791 --> 01:24:26.249
Heart, soul,

01:24:26.332 --> 01:24:29.374
and brains enough to
know that he struck lucky

01:24:29.457 --> 01:24:31.541
in his female companion.

01:24:31.624 --> 01:24:34.541
Good example for
the kid to emulate.

01:24:35.915 --> 01:24:38.124
And no fee for the sermon.

01:24:38.791 --> 01:24:40.457
Excuse me now.

01:24:45.541 --> 01:24:46.915
Hey.

01:24:50.833 --> 01:24:53.749
Maybe you oughta think
about running for office?

01:24:53.833 --> 01:24:55.499
Outnumbered,
as we are,

01:24:55.583 --> 01:24:57.249
by shit-birds.

01:25:00.457 --> 01:25:02.541
Food for thought,
Mr. Swearengen.

01:25:02.624 --> 01:25:04.708
That idea

01:25:04.791 --> 01:25:07.541
is my wedding gift to you.

01:25:08.624 --> 01:25:09.833
Thank you.

01:25:56.291 --> 01:25:57.957
Heard you was
down here.

01:26:03.915 --> 01:26:06.082
This one was Charlie's.

01:26:11.249 --> 01:26:13.416
Yours now.

01:26:14.082 --> 01:26:16.082
Sure he'd want that.

01:26:24.291 --> 01:26:26.999
Past when I took
what Cy gave me,

01:26:28.583 --> 01:26:30.749
I'd pray
I wouldn't wake up.

01:26:33.583 --> 01:26:37.124
You gutless cunt.
Don't you speak that way to me again.

01:26:37.957 --> 01:26:41.541
Nor neither am I saying I feel
that way now, is my point.

01:26:41.624 --> 01:26:43.499
You...

01:26:43.583 --> 01:26:45.708
gimme a goddamn kiss
and say, "I promise

01:26:45.791 --> 01:26:48.999
I won't fold,
no matter how sad I get."

01:26:49.082 --> 01:26:51.165
Or just don't say
a word at all then.

01:26:51.249 --> 01:26:53.369
Just go ahead and give me a
kiss and don't say a word.

01:27:05.416 --> 01:27:06.499
Oh.

01:27:09.957 --> 01:27:12.291
All right. Well...

01:27:13.708 --> 01:27:15.374
you bring to recollection

01:27:15.457 --> 01:27:17.957
you're a hell of
a good kisser.

01:27:18.791 --> 01:27:21.416
And you're still
chewing that licorice?

01:27:21.499 --> 01:27:24.708
That's my 12th
least-worst sin.

01:27:24.791 --> 01:27:29.416
Time comes, I have
$14,057 in the mattress,

01:27:29.499 --> 01:27:31.915
which you will
divide equally.

01:27:31.999 --> 01:27:33.791
You fight amongst
yourselves,

01:27:33.874 --> 01:27:35.749
you will wish
there was no hell

01:27:35.833 --> 01:27:39.499
because I will surely come back
and cut your fuckin' throats.

01:27:40.374 --> 01:27:42.666
- Well, I don't want your money.
- Yeah...

01:27:44.833 --> 01:27:45.915
There.

01:27:47.040 --> 01:27:48.416
Gentlemen...

01:27:49.332 --> 01:27:52.082
can we not appear
as quadruplets?

01:28:16.874 --> 01:28:19.249
Bless you for
being upright,

01:28:19.332 --> 01:28:22.791
for letting me have
my hand on your arm,

01:28:22.874 --> 01:28:25.874
and for being the showing-up
sort that you are.

01:28:30.207 --> 01:28:32.874
What's else is gravy.

01:28:57.457 --> 01:28:59.499
Safe passage to us all.

01:29:02.249 --> 01:29:04.416
Oh, you're
a picture, miss.

01:29:06.708 --> 01:29:08.915
- Means something.
- Mm-hmm.

01:29:22.165 --> 01:29:23.999
Three times I go around?

01:29:24.207 --> 01:29:26.040
Always coming back.

01:29:26.291 --> 01:29:28.457
I ain't gave to flight.

01:29:34.249 --> 01:29:35.915
Righteousness.

01:29:40.791 --> 01:29:42.541
Loving kindness.

01:29:54.124 --> 01:29:56.040
Justice.

01:30:02.999 --> 01:30:04.374
For all in my ignorance,

01:30:04.457 --> 01:30:06.708
I, uh, do not hew
to the letter of,

01:30:06.791 --> 01:30:08.874
uh, its practice,
but I'd hope

01:30:08.957 --> 01:30:10.874
the brief ceremony

01:30:10.957 --> 01:30:14.165
will be respectful
to... Jewishness!

01:30:14.624 --> 01:30:17.291
Level best, Reverend!
A for effort.

01:30:17.374 --> 01:30:18.541
Eh, bless you, my son,

01:30:18.624 --> 01:30:20.874
and thank you
for understanding.

01:30:21.999 --> 01:30:23.332
Sermon's over.

01:30:23.416 --> 01:30:25.165
That's all!

01:30:25.624 --> 01:30:29.082
I'll now ask
the young Miss Sofia

01:30:29.165 --> 01:30:32.499
to come forward with
the nuptial rings.

01:30:38.291 --> 01:30:41.082
By the powers of each of
their religions and practices,

01:30:41.165 --> 01:30:44.416
I now pronounce Sol
and Trixie man and wife.

01:30:48.499 --> 01:30:50.332
Should your husband kiss you?

01:30:50.416 --> 01:30:52.749
Lest he be
sleepin' outdoors.

01:31:17.374 --> 01:31:20.791
Been thinking, Jane.
Maybe I'd like to see the world.

01:31:20.874 --> 01:31:23.624
For instance,
what's France like?

01:31:23.708 --> 01:31:24.957
Don't know.

01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.791
Never wanted to see it
till this minute.

01:32:05.291 --> 01:32:06.833
Happy occasion.

01:32:20.583 --> 01:32:22.791
Papa!

01:32:53.291 --> 01:32:54.957
Are you all right?

01:33:04.957 --> 01:33:08.040
Let's... figure out what
to do with that land.

01:33:51.499 --> 01:33:54.416
Ah, Jesus, Mary, Joseph,
and all risen saints.

01:33:54.499 --> 01:33:58.207
For once in your life,
resist the urge for utterance.

01:34:00.541 --> 01:34:03.874
As witness before
my newborn child

01:34:03.957 --> 01:34:06.124
my hope in
beginning again,

01:34:06.207 --> 01:34:08.165
I pray we forbear from

01:34:08.249 --> 01:34:10.249
fucking up each
other's lives further,

01:34:10.332 --> 01:34:12.291
and live in peace and quiet.

01:34:16.207 --> 01:34:18.957
It seems to me, Mrs. Star,

01:34:19.040 --> 01:34:21.791
in coming forward
to conciliate me,

01:34:21.874 --> 01:34:25.207
you consign yourself to a misery

01:34:25.291 --> 01:34:27.833
not unlike a sort of...

01:34:27.915 --> 01:34:29.040
execution.

01:34:30.624 --> 01:34:33.583
These two gentlemen
are sheriff and deputy

01:34:33.666 --> 01:34:34.957
from a neighboring town,

01:34:35.040 --> 01:34:37.457
brought in to
represent my interests.

01:34:37.541 --> 01:34:39.624
Sheriff Laraby from Lead.

01:34:40.416 --> 01:34:42.914
- We have a warrant for the arrest
of Trixie Star -

01:34:42.915 --> 01:34:44.665
for the attempted murder
of Mr. George Hearst.

01:34:44.666 --> 01:34:46.124
You get the hell outta here.

01:34:46.207 --> 01:34:48.207
Forbear, son,
lest you be undone.

01:34:48.291 --> 01:34:49.833
I'm not your son,

01:34:49.915 --> 01:34:52.124
no more than you're the boss
of the fuckin' future.

01:34:52.207 --> 01:34:55.165
Why, I believe I am
its whole inheritor.

01:34:55.249 --> 01:34:57.999
These men have
no jurisdiction here.

01:34:58.957 --> 01:35:01.040
I'm guessing these
two you brought

01:35:01.124 --> 01:35:03.165
don't know the extent
of your crimes here.

01:35:03.249 --> 01:35:05.833
Prime suspect in the murder
of Charlie Utter.

01:35:07.291 --> 01:35:09.291
Are you going
to incarcerate me again,

01:35:09.374 --> 01:35:10.624
Marshal Bullock?

01:35:10.708 --> 01:35:12.833
This time,
for how many minutes?

01:35:12.915 --> 01:35:15.207
Let's find out together.

01:35:17.249 --> 01:35:18.874
- Little tight on my wrist.
- Shut up.

01:35:18.957 --> 01:35:22.207
Come through my town,
you stop at the marshal's office first.

01:35:22.291 --> 01:35:25.457
Way a fellow lawman would do,
showing any fuckin' respect.

01:35:25.541 --> 01:35:27.999
Sorry for the interruption.
Carry on with the celebration.

01:35:31.791 --> 01:35:33.031
Smile, Senator Hearst!

01:35:35.291 --> 01:35:37.207
- Get him outta here.
- Good riddance!

01:35:44.124 --> 01:35:45.874
'Fore you lock him up,

01:35:45.957 --> 01:35:49.332
no harm you letting us have
a word with Mr. Hearst.

01:35:49.416 --> 01:35:52.374
Speaking for Charlie Utter,
as is gone from amongst us.

01:35:52.457 --> 01:35:54.708
What's going on here?
What's in train?

01:35:54.791 --> 01:35:59.207
This United States
of American Senator...

01:36:00.332 --> 01:36:02.374
had Charlie Utter murdered!

01:36:02.457 --> 01:36:04.164
- Yeah! He's a murderer!
- Without remorse!

01:36:05.624 --> 01:36:07.499
- Nor recourse!
- Can't hide behind that!

01:36:07.583 --> 01:36:10.082
Nor fucking recollection!

01:36:11.499 --> 01:36:13.040
I'll tear your head
clean off, boy,

01:36:13.124 --> 01:36:14.583
if that'll help recollection.

01:36:14.666 --> 01:36:16.248
Who heaves something
next gets dealt with.

01:36:16.249 --> 01:36:18.249
- You entitled motherfucker!
- Son of a bitch.

01:36:18.291 --> 01:36:19.416
Steer your people,
Marshal.

01:36:19.499 --> 01:36:21.416
- Shut the fuck up!
- Cocksuckers!

01:36:21.499 --> 01:36:22.874
Nobody answering no one!

01:36:22.957 --> 01:36:25.666
- Do what-all they want!
- You got that right!

01:36:57.374 --> 01:36:59.874
Go on now! Go! Go.

01:37:04.708 --> 01:37:06.583
- Easy!
- What the hell?

01:37:08.874 --> 01:37:10.833
Come on, let us finish it.

01:37:10.915 --> 01:37:12.082
Leave him be.

01:37:12.749 --> 01:37:14.291
My God...

01:37:14.374 --> 01:37:16.124
Lest I arrest every one of you.

01:37:19.833 --> 01:37:21.332
I've seen enough.

01:37:25.583 --> 01:37:26.915
Ah!

01:37:31.416 --> 01:37:32.666
Get the fuckin' Doc.

01:37:32.749 --> 01:37:35.957
Oh yeah, let's do allay
the cocksucker in his misery.

01:37:36.749 --> 01:37:38.124
Now, Jane!

01:37:38.749 --> 01:37:40.583
Hope you die in the street.

01:37:40.666 --> 01:37:42.165
Like my dad did!

01:37:45.249 --> 01:37:46.999
Go on home, now!

01:37:48.249 --> 01:37:49.499
You son of a bitch!

01:37:51.915 --> 01:37:54.915
Have you finished
your impotent display?

01:37:54.999 --> 01:37:56.207
No, I don't
believe I have.

01:38:55.791 --> 01:38:56.832
You're my witness, Senator.

01:38:56.833 --> 01:38:58.583
Marshal's trying
to kill you.

01:39:10.332 --> 01:39:12.249
Coward was coming
behind you, Bullock.

01:39:13.708 --> 01:39:15.874
'Bout to shoot
you back the head.

01:39:15.957 --> 01:39:17.082
Jane!

01:39:27.291 --> 01:39:29.457
You son of a bitch, Harry.

01:39:31.749 --> 01:39:34.708
That was Bill
come into me.

01:39:34.791 --> 01:39:36.541
Him come to protect us.

01:39:36.624 --> 01:39:39.291
No, Jane. That was you.

01:40:01.457 --> 01:40:03.291
The Good Book, Marshal...

01:40:06.082 --> 01:40:07.957
says...

01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:11.249
the Lord chooses
amongst His witnesses...

01:40:12.541 --> 01:40:14.999
them'd be thought
least likely.

01:40:17.833 --> 01:40:19.249
Is that so?

01:40:23.874 --> 01:40:26.583
You might should
oughta know...

01:40:29.583 --> 01:40:31.583
before what happened...

01:40:32.249 --> 01:40:34.165
Mr. Utter...

01:40:34.915 --> 01:40:36.999
seemed to me...

01:40:37.082 --> 01:40:38.999
a different man.

01:40:43.457 --> 01:40:46.249
Like a weight had come
off his shoulders.

01:40:49.957 --> 01:40:51.957
What else they say

01:40:52.040 --> 01:40:54.207
about the Lord's witnesses?

01:40:57.791 --> 01:40:59.499
What else?

01:41:00.124 --> 01:41:02.666
Their defects...

01:41:02.749 --> 01:41:04.833
notwithstanding,

01:41:04.915 --> 01:41:06.833
they testify to His

01:41:06.915 --> 01:41:08.708
wond'rous glory.

01:41:15.332 --> 01:41:17.541
Singing, he was,
at the end, Marshal,

01:41:19.583 --> 01:41:21.291
'bout walking the valley.

01:41:23.583 --> 01:41:26.791
Joyful to hear and behold.

01:41:40.583 --> 01:41:42.040
Singing.

01:42:03.207 --> 01:42:05.082
If you have it
in you to abide,

01:42:05.165 --> 01:42:07.124
I'd not have
you leave me.

01:42:07.207 --> 01:42:08.749
I won't, Al.

01:42:08.833 --> 01:42:11.749
Comes to it, Jewel
and me will see to you.

01:42:12.708 --> 01:42:14.457
I'll have the little
one brought in.

01:42:18.040 --> 01:42:19.915
I heard you singing
the other day.

01:42:19.999 --> 01:42:22.082
I thought you'd
stabbed a frog.

01:42:26.207 --> 01:42:28.124
If you want, Al,

01:42:28.207 --> 01:42:31.416
I can rub your feet.
Shaky hands,

01:42:31.499 --> 01:42:33.416
but it works well.

01:42:33.499 --> 01:42:35.124
Go ahead then.
