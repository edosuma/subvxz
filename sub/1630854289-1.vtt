00:52.623 --> 00:53.919
- Good evening.

00:54.757 --> 00:57.296
Welcome to the gamble.

00:57.331 --> 00:58.891
I'm sure you're
all familiar with

00:58.926 --> 01:02.334
the hood horror stories of old,

01:03.029 --> 01:08.065
Blacula, Bones, People
Under the Stairs,

01:08.100 --> 01:14.280
Tales From the Hood,
and Candy Man.

01:14.975 --> 01:17.415
But I'm willing to bet
that you've never heard

01:17.450 --> 01:21.155
of this particular story before.

01:22.290 --> 01:26.688
This is the tell of the
first black serial killer

01:26.723 --> 01:30.395
to ever don a mask.

01:30.826 --> 01:35.334
His name is Bitch Ass.

01:36.238 --> 01:38.271
This is a story of revenge.

01:38.306 --> 01:44.277
A story of nightmarish tales
in which the stakes are no less

01:44.312 --> 01:47.313
than your very lives.

01:48.646 --> 01:55.013
Are you willing
to play?

01:55.048 --> 02:02.460
Good, good. Let the
story begin.

04:03.616 --> 04:05.352
- Why you running?

04:05.948 --> 04:07.013
Do you know who I am?

04:07.048 --> 04:08.421
Give me what's in your bag.
- No!

04:08.456 --> 04:09.521
- I said give me what's in
your bag and you can go.

04:09.556 --> 04:10.786
- No.

04:10.821 --> 04:12.084
- Bitch, you know who I am?
- I don't care.

04:12.119 --> 04:12.755
- I'm X, with the
sixth street gang.

04:12.790 --> 04:14.086
- I don't care.

04:14.121 --> 04:15.252
- Girl, you need to learn
some fucking manners.

04:16.398 --> 04:17.430
Bitch, you know who I am!

04:18.796 --> 04:19.795
- Hey, you ain't gonna
hit me like no bitch, man.

04:21.997 --> 04:22.798
Yo, you just knocked
my fucking tooth out.

04:23.900 --> 04:26.296
- Ouch, mother fucker,
get off.

04:26.331 --> 04:27.374
Get off of me!

04:27.409 --> 04:28.507
You know who I'm with?

04:28.542 --> 04:30.267
Sixth street gang,
mother fucker.

04:30.302 --> 04:33.303
Get off me, get
off me.

05:12.245 --> 05:13.585
- You're late Q.

05:14.555 --> 05:15.389
- Sorry.

05:16.590 --> 05:18.018
- You're sorry.

05:22.189 --> 05:25.531
Can anyone tell me what the
deadliest animal in Africa is?

05:27.359 --> 05:28.325
- Lion

05:28.360 --> 05:29.502
- Tiger

05:29.537 --> 05:30.536
- Elephant

05:33.068 --> 05:33.902
- No.

05:36.038 --> 05:37.301
What about you, Q?

05:39.613 --> 05:40.876
- It's the hippo.

05:43.881 --> 05:47.080
- It's the hippo.

05:47.115 --> 05:51.557
That is correct.
Can anybody tell me why?

05:54.254 --> 05:58.058
It is because mother
fuckers underestimate,

05:58.896 --> 05:59.895
the hippo.

06:01.470 --> 06:07.067
You see, all they see is some
cute cuddly fat ass water cow.

06:08.004 --> 06:10.774
And they get up and
they get too close.

06:13.581 --> 06:16.483
You're fucking dead.

06:19.345 --> 06:22.621
Is that what you're doing?
Underestimating me.

06:24.526 --> 06:25.657
- No.

06:25.692 --> 06:27.593
- That's good, because
underestimating me

06:27.628 --> 06:29.760
can be just as fucking deadly.

06:33.326 --> 06:37.933
Damn tonight, is y'all's
six, six, six night.

06:39.937 --> 06:44.005
20 years ago today,
it was my initiation.

06:44.942 --> 06:49.274
So, as a little
anniversary celebration,

06:50.178 --> 06:52.453
I got a special
task for the group.

06:53.852 --> 06:55.313
A rich old bitch down the street

06:55.348 --> 06:57.557
done finally kicked the bucket.

06:59.022 --> 07:00.923
The wicked bitch is dead.

07:00.958 --> 07:03.530
Back in my day, rumor had it,

07:04.797 --> 07:07.666
she had money and all
types of rich lady shit

07:07.701 --> 07:09.668
stashed away in the house.

07:09.703 --> 07:10.636
So, you

07:11.672 --> 07:12.968
are gonna break in

07:14.037 --> 07:15.399
and rob the place.

07:23.651 --> 07:25.112
What, Moo?

07:25.147 --> 07:26.718
- If there's money in there,

07:26.753 --> 07:28.654
how come you never
got it before?

07:33.925 --> 07:35.188
- Put your hand down.

07:37.995 --> 07:41.326
Robbing old people is fucked up.

07:42.670 --> 07:43.999
Do you think I'm a monster?

07:44.034 --> 07:47.167
- Um no, naw.

07:49.435 --> 07:52.403
- But what about her grandson?
Doesn't he still live there?

07:53.439 --> 07:55.208
- I heard that
guy worships the devil.

07:55.243 --> 07:58.915
Sacrifices animals
and shit like this.

07:58.950 --> 08:02.721
- Nah, man, he kidnaps
people and eats them.

08:02.756 --> 08:04.657
On some cannibal shit.

08:04.692 --> 08:08.661
Little Bobby, Fat Kevin, Cross
eyed Keisha and Lil' Vernon.

08:08.696 --> 08:10.520
And what about X?

08:10.555 --> 08:11.895
He's been missing
for a week and last

08:11.930 --> 08:13.490
anybody's saw him
was over by that house.

08:13.525 --> 08:15.734
- Hey, hey, hey,
stop this bull shit.

08:18.233 --> 08:19.870
I grew up with that fat fuck.

08:19.905 --> 08:23.577
Trust me, when I tell
you, he's a bitch.

08:24.206 --> 08:25.579
- I ain't afraid of him.

08:26.406 --> 08:28.241
- Shit, I know
you ain't, nephew.

08:29.783 --> 08:34.115
- We gonna go in that house.
And we gonna handle that shit.

08:35.481 --> 08:36.315
- Good,

08:37.824 --> 08:39.318
and when y'all done,

08:41.487 --> 08:42.321
come back here

08:43.159 --> 08:44.389
and I will give you

08:46.800 --> 08:47.733
your first cut.

08:49.396 --> 08:52.232
And then, you will officially

08:54.236 --> 08:57.468
be members of sixth
street.

09:00.341 --> 09:02.473
All right, y'all get
the fuck out of here.

09:06.754 --> 09:08.149
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
Hold up, Q.

09:10.153 --> 09:12.758
Hey look, man, all
this running late shit.

09:13.585 --> 09:14.595
That's got to stop.

09:16.159 --> 09:18.764
- Yeah. I'm sorry, Spade.

09:20.493 --> 09:21.096
I had school.

09:21.131 --> 09:22.295
- You had school?

09:23.430 --> 09:26.068
Hey, is school putting
money in your pocket?

09:27.302 --> 09:28.741
Goddamn, I'm trying
to help you, man,

09:28.776 --> 09:30.677
but you're not making that easy.

09:30.712 --> 09:33.273
You and your moms,
y'all struggling, right?

09:34.639 --> 09:36.683
Damn man, she's working two
jobs?

09:36.718 --> 09:38.311
You want to help her?

09:38.951 --> 09:40.412
Man, you get serious
about this crew,

09:40.447 --> 09:42.821
you could put some real
money in her pocket.

09:44.616 --> 09:45.626
Go ahead.

09:51.832 --> 09:54.459
- Yeah, okay, I got it.

09:54.494 --> 09:56.802
- All right.
Don't come back till it's done.

10:01.534 --> 10:05.602
Hey, it has been a minute
since X came around.

10:05.637 --> 10:06.536
You know anything?

10:07.749 --> 10:12.686
- Naw, nothing yet.
But X, that kid's stupid.

10:13.678 --> 10:16.316
I figured he just got picked
up snatching purses again.

10:16.351 --> 10:18.890
- Damn, I told him to stop
doing that petty shit.

10:20.685 --> 10:23.059
All right, if you hear
something, you let me know.

10:23.094 --> 10:24.159
- I got you.

10:27.494 --> 10:29.967
- Shit, I don't
know about y'all.

10:30.002 --> 10:32.134
I can't wait to go to the beach.

10:32.169 --> 10:34.708
Catch some sunsets
and shit, ball out.

10:35.843 --> 10:37.810
- Nigga, sunsets?

10:37.845 --> 10:39.713
- Yeah, so what.

10:39.748 --> 10:42.672
- Man with my cut.
I'm trying to marry my girl.

10:42.707 --> 10:45.884
So, if y'all find an engagement
ring in there, give it here.

10:45.919 --> 10:46.984
Ya feel me?

10:47.019 --> 10:49.184
- Shit, oh, fuck.

10:49.219 --> 10:51.384
- Hey man, why is Q
Ball coming tonight?

10:51.419 --> 10:54.992
- Yeah man, he's whack.
Punk's just gonna slow us down.

10:55.027 --> 10:57.654
- He's fine.
He with me.

10:57.689 --> 10:59.799
Y'all need to worry
about y'all selves.

11:02.903 --> 11:03.704
You ready?

11:04.696 --> 11:07.037
- Bro, I don't know, man.

11:07.072 --> 11:09.006
- What you mean, you don't know?

11:09.041 --> 11:10.942
Haven't I always
looked out for you?

11:10.977 --> 11:12.042
- Yeah.

11:12.077 --> 11:13.747
- Made sure nobody
messing with you.

11:15.575 --> 11:16.673
- Yeah.

11:16.708 --> 11:18.114
- And when we got
caught shoplifting,

11:18.149 --> 11:19.951
who took the blame for that?

11:19.986 --> 11:20.952
- You did.

11:20.987 --> 11:22.184
- That's right?

11:22.219 --> 11:24.417
Cause you like a brother
to me, man.

11:25.552 --> 11:27.717
Now I need you to have my back.

11:27.752 --> 11:30.291
- Wait, why the locks on
the outside of the house?

11:30.326 --> 11:31.798
- Old lady had dementia

11:31.833 --> 11:33.723
and would wonder the streets
in the middle of the night.

11:33.758 --> 11:36.660
- Yo, I think I see
something in the window.

11:37.938 --> 11:38.970
You think that's him?

11:43.405 --> 11:45.372
- Ah! Oh shit!

11:45.407 --> 11:48.243
- Relax man.
It's just my pager.

11:50.082 --> 11:52.445
Oh, shit, it's my mom.

11:52.480 --> 11:57.087
Hey yo, look, I gotta go.
She's gonna flip out.

11:57.122 --> 11:59.485
- I think your
momma fine as hell.

11:59.520 --> 12:02.323
- Shit, me too, actually.

12:03.755 --> 12:05.722
- Thanks. I guess.

12:05.757 --> 12:07.867
- All right, I'm out.

12:09.937 --> 12:13.774
- Yo Q, make sure you
be here at midnight.

12:18.847 --> 12:20.506
- 20 he don't show.

12:20.541 --> 12:21.309
- 40.

12:22.180 --> 12:24.851
- Don't worry. He'll be here.

12:44.631 --> 12:45.465
- Mom?

12:47.469 --> 12:50.272
Mom, I thought you quit.

12:50.307 --> 12:52.978
- I thought you were
supposed to be home on time.

12:54.641 --> 12:55.277
- Mom.

12:55.312 --> 12:56.311
- Don't, mom, me.

12:57.578 --> 12:59.050
I want you to explain to me

12:59.085 --> 13:01.481
why I have to page
you to come home.

13:01.516 --> 13:03.857
On 6, 6, 6 night, no less.

13:05.487 --> 13:07.421
You know how dangerous that is?

13:09.425 --> 13:13.295
- Sorry, I stopped by
a friend's house and

13:13.330 --> 13:14.835
I lost track of time.

13:16.234 --> 13:18.696
- Whose? Tucks?

13:20.073 --> 13:21.138
- No, it was.

13:21.173 --> 13:22.007
- Quentin.

13:24.407 --> 13:27.144
We're gonna pick this
conversation up later.

13:27.179 --> 13:29.608
Right now, you have company.

13:35.847 --> 13:37.352
- Ms. Jacobs.

13:37.387 --> 13:41.554
- Quentin, hey, yeah I wanted
to come by and talk to you.

13:42.689 --> 13:45.162
This is delicious, Miss Gatson.

13:45.197 --> 13:46.933
- Oh, call me Marsia.
- Mm

13:47.969 --> 13:49.562
- Is this about the scholarship?

13:51.566 --> 13:52.268
- Yes.

13:52.303 --> 13:54.600
- So I got it?

13:57.077 --> 13:57.911
- No.

13:59.376 --> 14:01.079
- But, you said I was a shoe-in.

14:02.379 --> 14:05.886
- I know, but truth is
I say that to everyone.

14:08.121 --> 14:09.615
- Excuse me?

14:09.650 --> 14:12.123
- I got to tell them something
to get them to apply.

14:12.158 --> 14:13.520
You understand?

14:13.555 --> 14:16.886
- But, there's gotta be
more that I can apply for.

14:16.921 --> 14:17.964
- Let's face it.

14:17.999 --> 14:20.758
Your grades are good,
but not great.

14:21.827 --> 14:24.036
It's not like you're
trying to be a doctor.

14:24.071 --> 14:25.666
- I am trying to be a doctor.

14:28.735 --> 14:29.569
- Oh.

14:32.574 --> 14:34.409
- I think it's time you leave.

14:34.444 --> 14:37.115
- Before I go, where can
I get the recipe for this?

14:38.679 --> 14:40.877
- I bought it at the store.

14:40.912 --> 14:45.156
- Ooh, I got to go to
that store.

14:59.205 --> 15:01.073
- Man, why do I gotta do dishes?

15:01.108 --> 15:02.272
I didn't even eat.

15:02.307 --> 15:04.505
- I don't recall that
being a requirement.

15:07.609 --> 15:10.610
Maybe now you can tell me why
you came in my house late.

15:13.021 --> 15:14.812
We talked about this Q.

15:14.847 --> 15:17.991
I do not want you hanging
out with Spade and those

15:18.026 --> 15:19.454
sixth street ass-holes.

15:19.489 --> 15:21.621
- Spade's not a bad guy.
He's just looking out for me.

15:21.656 --> 15:23.590
- Okay, that's the way it seems.

15:23.625 --> 15:26.593
But Spade is always
looking out for himself.

15:26.628 --> 15:27.792
- No, he's just

15:27.827 --> 15:29.167
- I grew up with
people like Spade.

15:30.137 --> 15:31.532
You are not like them.

15:32.634 --> 15:34.172
You are going to college.

15:35.241 --> 15:39.177
- Come on mom, you
heard Ms. Jacobs.

15:41.907 --> 15:43.148
- Okay, Q.

15:44.250 --> 15:46.745
I'm sorry about
the scholarship baby,

15:47.913 --> 15:50.188
but I don't give a
damn what she said.

15:50.916 --> 15:55.952
- Maybe I could just
get a job and you know,

15:55.987 --> 15:58.295
earn some money and
I'll do college later.

15:58.330 --> 16:00.033
- No, Quentin,

16:02.334 --> 16:05.170
because later becomes never.

16:08.670 --> 16:12.012
I will figure out a
way to pay for college.

16:14.038 --> 16:17.710
I don't care if I have to
work a third and a fourth job.

16:17.745 --> 16:19.085
I'll take care of it.

16:22.849 --> 16:23.683
- Thanks mom.

16:26.391 --> 16:27.852
I love you.

16:29.526 --> 16:31.064
- I love you too.

16:32.760 --> 16:35.629
- Does this mean I don't
have to put away any dishes?

16:40.537 --> 16:41.734
- I'll tell you what.

16:44.145 --> 16:46.277
I'll play you for it.

16:46.312 --> 16:47.113
- Okay.
- Okay.

16:47.148 --> 16:49.676
- All right, let's go.

16:49.711 --> 16:52.085
- 1, 2, 3, shoot.

16:56.817 --> 16:59.785
- No you didn't.

- You good?

17:56.646 --> 17:58.283

18:00.144 --> 18:01.484
If all the windows
and doors are locked,

18:01.519 --> 18:02.683
how are we gonna get in?

18:03.488 --> 18:05.455
- Don't trip.
I can pick locks.

18:05.490 --> 18:07.985
- No, you can't, fucking liar.

18:08.020 --> 18:09.261
- Of course I can.

18:09.296 --> 18:10.361
I learned it from mom.

18:11.496 --> 18:14.090
- Right there.
There's your locked door.

18:14.125 --> 18:14.860
Show me.

18:20.637 --> 18:21.834
- He can pick locks?

18:22.837 --> 18:25.178
- Hell no, he can't.
His uncle's in jail.

18:26.643 --> 18:29.446
- Shit, ouch.
Ouch, shit.

18:34.387 --> 18:36.288
- Couldn't pick it.

18:36.323 --> 18:37.619
- Stupid ass.

18:37.654 --> 18:39.324
- Let's go around the back.

18:58.345 --> 18:59.179
What's up?

19:00.545 --> 19:02.545
- What do you thinks in there?

19:02.580 --> 19:04.646
- Who cares?
It's the Gushinson house.

19:04.681 --> 19:07.319
- Hey yo, I

19:07.354 --> 19:08.782

19:20.631 --> 19:22.697
Moo, go in there.

19:22.732 --> 19:25.205
- Man, what if they got
raccoons in there man.

19:26.373 --> 19:29.671
- I don't want rabies.
90% of raccoons got rabies.

19:29.706 --> 19:31.442
That's a fact.

19:31.477 --> 19:32.311
- Move.

19:34.106 --> 19:34.907
I'll do it.

19:48.054 --> 19:50.186

new game called again?

19:50.221 --> 19:53.189
- It's called Shopopoly.
It's life Monopoly.

19:53.224 --> 19:54.696
But instead of hotels
you buy snacks.

19:54.731 --> 19:56.863
- Leave it to you
to invent a game

19:56.898 --> 19:58.700
where you get to buy snacks.

20:00.473 --> 20:02.231
Good old snacks.

Where did you get this piece?

20:14.850 --> 20:17.048
- The museum room.
Grandma, you're hurting me.

20:17.083 --> 20:20.018
- That belonged to your Grandpa.

20:20.526 --> 20:22.922
You aren't supposed
to touch them.

20:22.957 --> 20:25.331
- I'm sorry, Grandma.

20:25.366 --> 20:27.564
- You disobeyed me, Cecil.

20:27.599 --> 20:30.732
- No, I said, I said,
I'm sorry.

20:30.767 --> 20:32.965
- Pain is penance,

20:33.836 --> 20:35.264
and penance

20:36.300 --> 20:37.838
is a gift to God.

20:37.873 --> 20:41.105
- No, no!

21:13.205 --> 21:14.039

- I think so.
There's some stairs up here.

21:37.867 --> 21:39.372

21:39.407 --> 21:43.002
If you knock anything down,
they're gonna know we down here.

22:04.729 --> 22:06.366

22:09.866 --> 22:12.229

22:12.264 --> 22:14.869
- We ain't here for the TV man.

22:14.904 --> 22:16.871
- So what's the plan?

22:16.906 --> 22:19.368

22:24.749 --> 22:25.946

22:25.981 --> 22:28.718

22:28.753 --> 22:30.522
- What the fuck is that?

Thou shall not swear.

26:06.597 --> 26:08.773
Thou shall not drink.

26:10.139 --> 26:11.468

<i>not lust</i> .

26:11.503 --> 26:12.843

26:12.878 --> 26:15.406
- That little trollop means
to corrupt you, Cecil.

26:15.441 --> 26:19.278
Tempt you, and I won't allow it.

26:19.313 --> 26:21.313
- No, she's an angel.

26:22.118 --> 26:23.623
- Hand me the switch.

26:24.890 --> 26:25.691

her anymore.

26:33.624 --> 26:37.131
- I wish I could
believe that, Cecil.

26:38.464 --> 26:39.463
I really do.

26:41.808 --> 26:42.741
Hand it to me.

26:52.676 --> 26:57.888
Now, take off your shirt.

27:04.094 --> 27:08.294
This is for your own good.

27:10.331 --> 27:13.563
Ahh!

27:16.337 --> 27:19.173

27:35.125 --> 27:36.355
A black cat?

What they want bad luck?

27:44.266 --> 27:45.364
A dinosaur.

28:50.266 --> 28:53.905
Remove the body
parts with the tongs.

28:53.940 --> 28:55.170
- Fuck you.

28:55.205 --> 28:57.535

28:58.846 --> 29:01.605
You will get a chance to
play me for your life.

29:03.015 --> 29:06.445
First, with three misses, dies.

30:17.782 --> 30:18.616
- Hold up.

Hey, Queen Cricket.

30:23.689 --> 30:26.822
Hey, that's why

Man, that was dope.

30:33.369 --> 30:35.831

31:32.098 --> 31:34.065
I ain't playing no more.

31:50.644 --> 31:52.248
Thanks for playing.

32:17.143 --> 32:20.144

Hold up.

32:38.527 --> 32:40.824
Um, black Jesus,

32:40.859 --> 32:44.234
A sister just trying

33:04.047 --> 33:04.848

Wait, wait.

35:15.981 --> 35:16.815

36:15.073 --> 36:16.039
Guess it's a tie.

36:17.383 --> 36:20.681
I guess we both leave.

36:20.716 --> 36:23.255
- There are no ties.

36:23.290 --> 36:25.147
Now we use our hands.

36:41.000 --> 36:42.065

41:14.207 --> 41:16.075
Forget those guys.

41:16.110 --> 41:19.144
Don't let them bother you.
They're idiots.

41:21.720 --> 41:22.554
What's that?

41:24.690 --> 41:27.020
- It's a puzzle cube.

41:27.693 --> 41:29.088
- You like games, huh?

41:30.729 --> 41:32.487
- Yeah, I do.

41:32.522 --> 41:35.061
I play them all the time
with my grandmother.

41:36.130 --> 41:37.734
- So how many games you got?

41:38.638 --> 41:41.738
- 300.
Maybe more.

41:41.773 --> 41:45.038
- Damn, that's a lot of games.

41:45.073 --> 41:47.843
- I, I built a game
house in my backyard.

41:47.878 --> 41:50.109
I make my own games
back there and

41:51.112 --> 41:53.310
that's what I want
to go to college for.

41:54.379 --> 41:55.279
- That's cool.

42:01.122 --> 42:05.388
- Would you like to come
over and play sometime?

42:06.633 --> 42:07.566
- Yeah.
Why not?

42:10.736 --> 42:11.702
- Boo.

42:11.737 --> 42:13.737
- Jesus.
That's not funny Spade.

42:16.643 --> 42:18.269
- Well, if it isn't
the spoiled rich boy

42:18.304 --> 42:19.908
from down the street.

42:19.943 --> 42:21.646
- It's it's not like that.

42:21.681 --> 42:23.274
- Oh, I don't know, Bitch Ass.

42:23.309 --> 42:25.881
You live in a big house and
your grandma drives a caddy.

42:25.916 --> 42:27.586
Seem pretty fucking rich to me.

42:28.314 --> 42:29.819
So what's going on here, Marsia?

42:29.854 --> 42:33.317
- Nothing, Cecil and I were
just talking about college.

42:33.352 --> 42:34.549
- You hear that, Boots?

42:34.584 --> 42:36.320
He plans on leaving
us all behind.

42:36.355 --> 42:38.256
Yo, maybe he thinking about
taking my girl with him.

42:38.291 --> 42:40.896
- Spade it's not like that.
- Let him answer.

42:40.931 --> 42:42.634
Is that what you're thinking?

42:42.669 --> 42:45.329
- No, I was asking
her if she wanted to

42:45.364 --> 42:47.232
come over and play sometime.

42:47.267 --> 42:48.937
- You know she would never
go out with you, right?

42:48.972 --> 42:50.136
- Please stop.

42:50.171 --> 42:51.643
- Nah, this nigga need
to hear the truth.

42:52.679 --> 42:54.239
She wouldn't fuck you
if you had a $20 bill

42:54.274 --> 42:55.680
hanging out your zipper.

42:56.342 --> 42:58.573
Lincoln couldn't get
your fat ass laid.

42:58.608 --> 43:01.778
- Abraham Lincoln is
on the five actually.

43:04.856 --> 43:05.723
- You like school?

43:06.858 --> 43:08.726
Well, I'm about to
teach you a lesson.

43:09.960 --> 43:11.795
Every action has consequences.

43:18.232 --> 43:20.804
- Grandma says, thou
shall not steal.

43:20.839 --> 43:21.838
- What?

43:21.873 --> 43:22.674
- Give it back.

43:22.709 --> 43:24.236
- Oh shit.

43:26.636 --> 43:28.009
Yo, fuck him up.
- Yo, you gonna die

43:28.044 --> 43:31.540
you fat fuck.

43:31.575 --> 43:33.311
Ooh, you're lucky
you're bitch grandma's

43:33.346 --> 43:34.752
here to save your ass.

43:35.887 --> 43:37.854
See you later, Bitch Ass.

43:37.889 --> 43:39.955
We gonna get that
nigger later, bro.

43:39.990 --> 43:41.957
- Yo, why'd you
have to do all that.

43:41.992 --> 43:43.552
- Why you with him anyway?

43:56.600 --> 43:57.907
- Holy shit.

44:05.081 --> 44:08.852
The crosses.

44:13.892 --> 44:14.726
Tuck?

44:18.193 --> 44:19.192
Tuck!

44:21.031 --> 44:22.195
Man, where the fuck you at?

44:27.301 --> 44:29.499
- Get me the fuck out of here!

44:29.534 --> 44:31.809
You know who you fucking with?

44:33.703 --> 44:36.275
- Do you know who
you fucking with?

44:58.761 --> 44:59.595
Your turn.

45:00.763 --> 45:03.401
Don't touch the red.

45:46.985 --> 45:48.017
- Tuck.

45:49.856 --> 45:50.822
Tuck.

46:44.240 --> 46:45.976
- Damn it, Q.

46:56.351 --> 46:58.714
- Tuck, where are you man?

48:08.126 --> 48:11.996
- Goddammit.

49:25.401 --> 49:26.598
- No.

49:28.107 --> 49:29.304
No.

49:29.339 --> 49:30.833
No. no!

49:30.868 --> 49:32.208
No!

49:32.243 --> 49:37.213
Please, stop.

50:07.113 --> 50:09.377
- Where is Spade?

50:10.039 --> 50:12.347
- Hey, I told her
not to come in here.

50:12.382 --> 50:13.612
- It's all good.

50:16.254 --> 50:17.715
Look who it is.

50:19.554 --> 50:21.015
How can I help you?

50:21.050 --> 50:23.688
- Cut the shit, Spade.
Where the fuck is my son?

50:23.723 --> 50:24.887
- You have a child?

50:25.494 --> 50:27.230
- You know who he is.

50:27.265 --> 50:29.727
- Yeah, I do know who he is.

50:30.400 --> 50:31.960
It's too bad.

50:31.995 --> 50:35.304
He is in the middle of
6, 6, 6 night right now.

50:35.339 --> 50:36.965
- My god, goddammit.

50:37.000 --> 50:39.209
I told you to stay the
fuck away from him.

50:39.244 --> 50:41.035
- Hey, hey, it is not my fault,

50:41.070 --> 50:43.807
your son doesn't
stay away from me.

50:43.842 --> 50:46.612
He probably needs a
father figure in his life.

50:47.483 --> 50:49.318
Who is his daddy, anyway?

50:49.353 --> 50:50.286
- Not you.

50:51.619 --> 50:53.322
- I bet his daddy's a bum.

50:55.425 --> 50:58.723
- I'd rather a bum
than a wanna be thug.

50:58.758 --> 51:00.956
- Hey, who you think
you talking to?

51:00.991 --> 51:04.267
- You cage nigga, back up.

51:04.302 --> 51:05.961
- It's all good.

51:05.996 --> 51:09.096
Listen, I'm a, I'm
gonna let that slide.

51:09.131 --> 51:11.670
Cause you and I, we do
have history, right?

51:11.705 --> 51:15.212
But hey, don't forget
who house you in.

51:17.942 --> 51:20.250
- Please tell me
where my son is.

51:20.285 --> 51:25.684
- He is out, robbing
somebody's house right now.

51:29.459 --> 51:31.195
- Who's?

51:31.230 --> 51:32.592
- You gonna love this shit.

51:32.627 --> 51:36.728
Wait for it
hold on, Bitch Ass.

51:37.665 --> 51:39.302
- Cecil's fucking house.

51:39.337 --> 51:41.128
- I forgot his name was Cecil.

51:41.163 --> 51:42.437
- Spade, what the fuck
is wrong with you?

51:42.472 --> 51:43.966
Hasn't he suffered enough?

51:44.672 --> 51:47.376
You fucking pathetic ass hole.

51:49.039 --> 51:52.007
- Who the fuck you
think you're talking to?

51:52.042 --> 51:54.812
I told you to show me
some fucking respect.

51:55.551 --> 51:58.321
I decide when somebody
has suffered enough.

51:59.654 --> 52:02.391
I told your boy, Bitch
Ass, we was gonna be back.

52:02.426 --> 52:04.393
And I'm a man of
my fucking word.

52:09.059 --> 52:13.028
Now, they should have
been back already.

52:13.063 --> 52:15.371
And we was just about
to go check on that.

52:16.869 --> 52:18.341
Would you like to roll?

52:23.513 --> 52:26.778
- You just take me
to my fucking son.

52:29.354 --> 52:30.716
- Okay.

52:31.587 --> 52:33.752
Boots, grab that
heat and let's go.

52:34.722 --> 52:36.920
You do see why I like
her though, right?

52:37.890 --> 52:39.329
- I don't get it.
That bitch mean.

52:39.364 --> 52:40.297
- It's the bald head.

52:55.204 --> 52:57.710
- Let's hurry up
and get this kid, man.

53:05.291 --> 53:06.455
Sure nobody in there?

53:06.490 --> 53:07.621
- Nope.

53:07.656 --> 53:08.721
- Is it locked?

53:08.756 --> 53:09.821
- Yes.

53:11.297 --> 53:12.593
- You know what, just
kick the door in.

53:12.628 --> 53:16.091
- Wait, can we knock first?

53:16.126 --> 53:17.092
- And say what?

53:17.127 --> 53:18.368
We sent some kids
here to rob you

53:18.403 --> 53:19.336
have you seen them?

53:20.570 --> 53:22.471
Hey, you wanna find Q or not?

53:23.606 --> 53:25.705
- Okay, fine.

53:25.740 --> 53:27.773
- Just kick it down, man.

53:27.808 --> 53:29.478
Back up.
- Oh.

53:30.580 --> 53:31.414
- There it is.

53:33.077 --> 53:38.487
- Hey look, I know what
your grandma did to you.

53:40.524 --> 53:41.919
It was fucked up, man.

53:42.493 --> 53:44.262
But you don't have to do this.

53:47.432 --> 53:48.794
I saw your yearbook.

53:49.665 --> 53:52.226
You knew my mom, Marsia.

54:03.305 --> 54:05.349
- So, can I ask you
a weird question?

54:06.451 --> 54:07.648
- Yeah, I guess.

54:07.683 --> 54:09.353
- Yo, what's up with the suit.

54:10.818 --> 54:12.818
- Grandma says treat
every day, like Sunday

54:12.853 --> 54:14.787
and the Lord will
always be with you.

54:14.822 --> 54:16.327
It's kind of her saying.

54:17.462 --> 54:19.825
- Okay, I like that.

54:19.860 --> 54:22.828
So uh, we're your parents?

54:24.326 --> 54:27.129
- They died in a car
accident when I was little.

54:30.299 --> 54:32.200
- You know my parents
aren't around either.

54:32.235 --> 54:34.840
I never really knew my
dad and my mom, well,

54:35.876 --> 54:37.073
she ain't around.

54:38.582 --> 54:40.351
Spade and his mom
took me in.

54:40.386 --> 54:42.177
They looked out for me.

54:42.685 --> 54:44.553
- Is that why you
with that jerk?

54:44.588 --> 54:47.358
- No, I love him.

54:48.724 --> 54:51.285
You know, he's not
such a bad guy.

54:51.320 --> 54:52.528
He just acts that way,

54:52.563 --> 54:54.024
cause his dad is the
leader of sixth street.

54:55.027 --> 54:56.290
You know, we're gonna
get a place together

54:56.325 --> 54:57.225
and get outta here.

54:59.262 --> 55:00.096
- If you say so.

55:02.331 --> 55:04.199
- So, why you like
games so much?

55:04.234 --> 55:08.907
- Because anyone can play, it
doesn't matter who you are.

55:08.942 --> 55:10.546
There's a game for everyone.

55:11.516 --> 55:13.175
- Okay, then what's your game?

55:14.519 --> 55:15.518
- All right.

55:16.686 --> 55:19.687
Don't laugh.
Rock, paper, scissors.

55:19.722 --> 55:22.019
- Rock, paper, scissors.
Really?

55:22.692 --> 55:23.823
Ain't that kind of boring?

55:23.858 --> 55:25.055
I mean there's no board,

55:25.090 --> 55:26.430
there's no pieces,
there ain't shit.

55:26.465 --> 55:28.828
- That's why it's great.
You can play it anywhere.

55:28.863 --> 55:31.160
Plus it's part
instinct, part luck,

55:31.195 --> 55:34.537
which makes it the purest
game ever invented.

55:34.572 --> 55:36.770
- Okay, then let's do it.

55:36.805 --> 55:37.672
- All right.

55:37.707 --> 55:39.608
So we'll go 1, 2, 3.

55:39.643 --> 55:41.335
- Yeah, I got it.

55:41.370 --> 55:42.380
- All right.

55:43.548 --> 55:45.911
1, 2, 3, shoot.

55:53.151 --> 55:54.887
- But, you don't
have to do this.

56:00.598 --> 56:02.290
- Man, you still
smoke cigarettes?

56:03.964 --> 56:05.700
Shit gonna kill you.

56:05.735 --> 56:07.064
- Shut up.

56:12.577 --> 56:13.609
- Ladies first.

56:15.074 --> 56:16.579
Got a stank attitude.

56:16.614 --> 56:19.615
- Just need to get in here and
find my baby, stop playing.

56:19.650 --> 56:21.947
- Always did wanna
come inside this house.

56:21.982 --> 56:22.981
- Spade!

56:23.016 --> 56:24.488
- Let's
go upstairs, man.

56:27.658 --> 56:29.592
- Wait, hey, wait!

56:29.627 --> 56:31.462
Hey wait!
Let me go!

56:42.266 --> 56:43.001
- Q?

56:46.512 --> 56:47.170
Where is he?

56:47.205 --> 56:48.578
- Will you chill out?

56:48.613 --> 56:49.777
Look, maybe they left already

56:49.812 --> 56:51.647
or just waiting for
us back at the house.

56:51.682 --> 56:53.176
- Well, then where is Cecil?

56:53.211 --> 56:55.079
- Yeah, the hell if I know.

56:55.114 --> 56:57.851
His bitch ass probably ran
away or he hiding somewhere.

56:57.886 --> 57:00.051
- Why do you hate him so much?

57:00.955 --> 57:02.625
- Because he disrespected me.

57:17.840 --> 57:19.004
- Oh god.

57:23.648 --> 57:25.483
I remember this photo.

57:30.380 --> 57:34.052
It was before you were so
concerned about respect.

57:34.087 --> 57:35.658
- Outta here, man.

57:43.734 --> 57:44.997
- I miss this kid.

57:46.836 --> 57:48.363
- Help me!

57:50.840 --> 57:53.170
Somebody help, please!

58:13.797 --> 58:15.027
- So what?

58:16.701 --> 58:19.064
- So what happened?

58:19.099 --> 58:21.099
- What happened?

58:21.134 --> 58:24.707
I grew up, is what happened.

58:25.743 --> 58:27.578
- You didn't have
to become this.

58:28.570 --> 58:29.613
- I didn't have no choice.

58:29.648 --> 58:31.373
You knew my dad
was counting on me.

58:35.214 --> 58:36.620
- I was counting on you.

59:04.749 --> 59:06.749
- That's a dope mask.

59:08.687 --> 59:10.918
You know, I should have
just fucking killed your fat

59:10.953 --> 59:12.755
board game head ass that day.

59:13.758 --> 59:15.626
What's the matter stutter mouth,

59:15.661 --> 59:17.485
cat go your tu, tu, tu.
- Shut up!

59:20.358 --> 59:23.557
- All right, got that
retarded strength, huh?

59:30.104 --> 59:32.566
Get your bitch ass up.

59:37.540 --> 59:38.814
- Come on.

59:38.849 --> 59:39.848
- Q.

59:46.450 --> 59:49.451
- Yo, go this way.
I'm gonna go that way.

1:00:19.824 --> 1:00:20.658
- Cecil?

1:00:42.506 --> 1:00:46.178
Oh my god, what
did they do to you?

1:00:51.185 --> 1:00:52.184
- Surprise.

1:00:54.188 --> 1:00:56.386
Damn, Bitch Ass Cecil.

1:00:58.357 --> 1:01:00.555
Where the fuck
is my crew?

1:01:01.899 --> 1:01:04.427
I'm not asking you again.
Where the fuck is my...

1:01:04.462 --> 1:01:05.461
- Spade.

1:01:07.201 --> 1:01:08.563
Just let me talk to him.

1:01:08.598 --> 1:01:10.906
- Then hurry up and
talk to him.

1:01:12.976 --> 1:01:14.206
Shit.

1:01:15.946 --> 1:01:19.112
- Please, my son
came here tonight.

1:01:19.147 --> 1:01:21.708
His name is Q.

1:01:21.743 --> 1:01:22.720
Where is he?

1:01:23.921 --> 1:01:25.217
Is he still here?

1:01:28.222 --> 1:01:29.551
Please, Cecil.

1:01:31.258 --> 1:01:33.027
- Look, man, enough of
this dumb shit, man.

1:01:33.062 --> 1:01:34.688
- No!

1:01:34.723 --> 1:01:36.393
I'm not gonna let you
do this to him again.

1:01:36.428 --> 1:01:37.559
- Wait you not gonna let me?

1:01:37.594 --> 1:01:38.296
- No.

1:01:38.331 --> 1:01:39.495
- You not gonna let me.

1:01:41.004 --> 1:01:43.037
You were just as guilty as I
was for what happened to him

1:01:43.072 --> 1:01:45.534
back in the day
or did you forget?

1:01:48.979 --> 1:01:50.704
- I need your help.

1:01:50.739 --> 1:01:51.782
- What is it?

1:01:51.817 --> 1:01:53.707
- I need you to get
Bitch Ass alone.

1:01:53.742 --> 1:01:55.709
- Nah, nah man.

1:01:55.744 --> 1:01:57.953
- Babe, listen, he,
he made look stupid.

1:01:57.988 --> 1:01:59.251
I can't just let that go.

1:02:00.287 --> 1:02:01.418
Look, I'm not gonna hurt him.

1:02:01.453 --> 1:02:02.793
I just wanna scare him.

1:02:05.259 --> 1:02:06.258
I love you.

1:02:07.261 --> 1:02:08.326
Don't you love me?

1:02:10.000 --> 1:02:11.296
- Yeah.

1:02:11.331 --> 1:02:12.902
- Then will you do it?

1:02:12.937 --> 1:02:14.904
- You promise you're not
gonna hurt him, right?

1:02:14.939 --> 1:02:16.136
- I swear.

1:02:32.385 --> 1:02:38.521
- Shit, wait,
you didn't know, did you?

1:02:43.033 --> 1:02:45.099
Yeah, you need to hear this.

1:02:45.134 --> 1:02:48.102
Did you really think
it was a coincidence

1:02:48.137 --> 1:02:50.005
that you went down
the alley that day?

1:02:56.805 --> 1:02:58.574
- Where are we?

1:02:59.247 --> 1:03:00.444
- Oh, it's a shortcut.

1:03:00.479 --> 1:03:01.643
Let's go that way.

1:03:01.678 --> 1:03:02.446
- All right.

1:03:15.164 --> 1:03:16.823
- Think you forgot
this, Bitch Ass.

1:03:16.858 --> 1:03:18.066
You thought you was
gonna get away with

1:03:18.101 --> 1:03:19.826
making me look stupid.

1:03:19.861 --> 1:03:22.664
- I, I said, sorry.

1:03:22.699 --> 1:03:24.303
- Well, that ain't good enough.

1:03:24.338 --> 1:03:25.403
And now you with
my girl, again.

1:03:25.438 --> 1:03:27.042
- We weren't doing anything.

1:03:27.077 --> 1:03:28.472
- Funny, cause
whenever I see you,

1:03:28.507 --> 1:03:29.913
it look like you're
doing a lot of something.

1:03:29.948 --> 1:03:31.981
- I just want to get outta here.

1:03:32.016 --> 1:03:33.081
- Yo, Boots, grab this nigga.

1:03:33.116 --> 1:03:34.841
- Again, I'm tired
of this nigga, man.

1:03:37.516 --> 1:03:39.714
- Spade, come on, don't.

1:03:41.850 --> 1:03:44.862
No, don't, leave him alone.
That's enough.

1:03:46.360 --> 1:03:48.162
No, please, don't do it.

1:03:48.197 --> 1:03:50.362
Don't, don't do that.

1:03:51.266 --> 1:03:52.100
Please.

1:03:52.135 --> 1:03:52.969
- Do it.

1:03:55.633 --> 1:03:57.072
- Stop!

1:03:57.107 --> 1:03:58.634
Leave him alone.

1:03:59.439 --> 1:04:01.505
- Stop it, that's enough.

1:04:01.540 --> 1:04:03.243
- Stop! That's enough.

1:04:06.050 --> 1:04:08.842
- Oh shit, it's his grandma.

1:04:16.456 --> 1:04:18.093
- Babe, come on, we gotta go.

1:04:18.128 --> 1:04:19.358
Yo, come on.

1:04:19.393 --> 1:04:21.393
We gotta get outta here.
- I'm so sorry.

1:04:29.337 --> 1:04:31.799
- Cecil, I'm so sorry.

1:04:31.834 --> 1:04:32.800
- You sorry to him?

1:04:34.276 --> 1:04:37.310
We're here looking for your
kid and you're sorry to him?

1:04:37.345 --> 1:04:38.146
- You sorry.

1:04:38.181 --> 1:04:38.982
- Ahh!

1:04:39.017 --> 1:04:41.413
- No, no Cecil.
Cecil.

1:04:43.846 --> 1:04:44.922
Stop!

1:04:50.193 --> 1:04:51.929
I'm sorry.

1:05:30.398 --> 1:05:32.266
Spade.

1:05:32.301 --> 1:05:35.137
Spade!

1:05:35.172 --> 1:05:36.765
You all right?
- What the fuck.

1:05:37.570 --> 1:05:39.042
- Are you all right?

1:05:39.077 --> 1:05:40.835
- What kind of shit is this?

1:05:49.186 --> 1:05:51.153
- What are you doing?

1:05:52.981 --> 1:05:53.815
Cecil?

1:05:56.193 --> 1:05:58.193
- Let us the hell
outta here, man.

1:05:58.228 --> 1:05:59.656
- Where's my son?

1:06:01.396 --> 1:06:02.692
Where's Quentin?

1:06:05.499 --> 1:06:07.895
- Your son is alive,

1:06:09.503 --> 1:06:10.502
for now.

1:06:11.604 --> 1:06:13.241
We must play.

1:06:13.276 --> 1:06:14.407
- You know what fine?

1:06:15.080 --> 1:06:17.113
Cause after I beat
you, I swear to God.

1:06:18.215 --> 1:06:19.511
I'm gonna kill your ass.

1:06:20.514 --> 1:06:23.515
- The game is called Mayday.

1:06:23.550 --> 1:06:26.254
The objective of this game

1:06:26.289 --> 1:06:28.520
is to shoot down
the opponents plane.

1:06:30.458 --> 1:06:33.030
Marsia, you will tell
us if there's a hit

1:06:34.231 --> 1:06:35.758
or a miss.

1:06:35.793 --> 1:06:39.234
You lie, your son dies.

1:06:41.205 --> 1:06:42.897
- You mother fucker.

1:06:44.571 --> 1:06:45.768
- Let's play.

1:06:45.803 --> 1:06:47.440
- Promise you, I
ain't gonna lose.

1:07:02.050 --> 1:07:04.127
- D four.

1:07:09.299 --> 1:07:10.562
- Miss.

1:07:11.895 --> 1:07:12.894
- Your turn.

1:07:15.668 --> 1:07:16.634
- E three.

1:07:19.243 --> 1:07:20.242
- Miss

1:07:21.575 --> 1:07:24.004

1:07:30.452 --> 1:07:31.616
- Hit.

1:07:37.624 --> 1:07:38.821
- Stab him.

1:07:39.428 --> 1:07:41.131
- What?

1:07:41.166 --> 1:07:41.989
- No.

1:07:42.662 --> 1:07:44.827
- Every hit gets a knife.

1:07:45.599 --> 1:07:48.765
It's either him, or Q.

1:07:50.098 --> 1:07:51.273
You choose.

1:07:52.276 --> 1:07:54.067
- Marsia, don't do this.

1:07:54.102 --> 1:07:56.311
Don't listen to him.
He's fucking crazy.

1:07:57.380 --> 1:07:59.611
Marsia, you ain't
got to do this.

1:08:03.353 --> 1:08:04.981
Marsia, don't listen to him.

1:08:08.050 --> 1:08:08.851
Marsia.

1:08:11.119 --> 1:08:12.855
Don't do this, man.
- I'm sorry

1:08:12.890 --> 1:08:14.087
- You don't even
know if he got Q.

1:08:17.862 --> 1:08:18.696
Fuck!

1:08:28.411 --> 1:08:29.872
- Come on

1:08:29.907 --> 1:08:30.873
Come on!

1:08:32.008 --> 1:08:37.220
Help please.

1:08:44.328 --> 1:08:45.327

1:08:47.155 --> 1:08:47.989

1:09:51.395 --> 1:09:52.691
- Hit.

1:09:52.726 --> 1:09:54.396
- Fucking finally.

1:10:08.676 --> 1:10:10.071
What the fuck.

1:10:11.415 --> 1:10:14.141
- A two.

1:10:25.253 --> 1:10:26.087
- No.

1:10:33.437 --> 1:10:34.436
Hit.

1:10:39.773 --> 1:10:40.904
There are no more spaces.

1:10:46.450 --> 1:10:47.449
- Game

1:10:48.485 --> 1:10:49.484
over.

1:11:28.052 --> 1:11:29.084
- Spade

1:11:32.562 --> 1:11:33.891
- You was right.

1:11:38.601 --> 1:11:40.370
I should have just
left with you.

1:11:43.265 --> 1:11:44.264
- It's okay.

1:11:55.684 --> 1:11:57.486
What are you doing?
- It's okay.

1:11:57.521 --> 1:11:58.421
- What is that?

1:11:58.456 --> 1:11:59.653
- Mayday.
Mayday.

1:11:59.688 --> 1:12:00.489
- No please!
- Oh my god.

1:12:00.524 --> 1:12:02.359
- You're going down.

1:12:10.127 --> 1:12:11.192
- Spade

1:12:19.642 --> 1:12:22.104
- Who's the bitch ass now?

1:12:23.877 --> 1:12:26.339
- Cecil, what the fuck, Cecil!

1:12:26.374 --> 1:12:27.450
Spade!

1:12:36.626 --> 1:12:37.889
- Okay.

1:12:38.496 --> 1:12:39.891
- No!

1:12:42.390 --> 1:12:43.466
- Mom?

1:12:52.807 --> 1:12:54.576
- I'm so sorry.

1:12:55.579 --> 1:12:56.611
Look at you.

1:13:01.981 --> 1:13:03.981
I was a kid.

1:13:05.952 --> 1:13:07.622
I made a bad decision.

1:13:10.924 --> 1:13:13.529
I didn't know what they
were gonna do to you.

1:13:33.947 --> 1:13:35.342
- I'm gonna get you out of here.

1:13:35.377 --> 1:13:37.685
Okay, I'm going to set you free.
- Thank you, help me.

1:13:38.886 --> 1:13:40.523
My Cecil,

1:13:40.558 --> 1:13:42.316
he's gone crazy.

1:13:43.726 --> 1:13:45.561
- I can't believe
you're still alive.

1:13:46.663 --> 1:13:50.159
- He made it look
like I was dead.

1:13:50.194 --> 1:13:51.457
- What?

1:13:51.492 --> 1:13:53.470
- Cause he knew you all
were trying to rob us.

1:13:54.495 --> 1:13:57.672
He tied me up.

1:13:57.707 --> 1:13:59.707
He left me here.

1:14:01.678 --> 1:14:03.337
I can't reason with him anymore.

1:14:03.372 --> 1:14:05.647
- Please, okay, okay,
please, please, please

1:14:05.682 --> 1:14:08.144
I need you to go save my mother.

1:14:08.179 --> 1:14:09.585
She's in your living room.

1:14:10.654 --> 1:14:14.315
- Over there, by
the door,

1:14:16.022 --> 1:14:17.692
there's an old knife.

1:14:31.070 --> 1:14:34.907
- Now, I told Cecil
y'all weren't right.

1:14:35.778 --> 1:14:36.744
- Okay.

1:14:41.014 --> 1:14:42.178
You knew?

1:14:45.183 --> 1:14:48.217
- That boy means
everything to me.

1:14:49.418 --> 1:14:52.529
And I'd do anything
to protect him.

1:14:54.863 --> 1:14:55.697
- Mom!

1:14:56.766 --> 1:14:57.765
Mom!

1:14:57.800 --> 1:14:58.601
- Q!

1:15:02.464 --> 1:15:03.265
- Mom!

1:15:05.643 --> 1:15:07.544
- No, Q!

1:15:08.206 --> 1:15:09.535
Q!

1:15:09.570 --> 1:15:11.746
Ahh! My baby!

1:15:11.781 --> 1:15:14.749
- You want your mommy?

1:15:14.784 --> 1:15:17.686
- Cecil, let me go!
Cecil!

1:15:17.721 --> 1:15:19.116
- Here she comes.

1:15:20.086 --> 1:15:22.548
- Where's my baby?

1:15:22.583 --> 1:15:26.288
- Mom, mom are you okay?
Are you okay?

1:15:28.325 --> 1:15:30.765
- Get them baby.
Kill them!

1:15:31.735 --> 1:15:33.427
- Shut up, goddammit!

1:15:36.674 --> 1:15:38.102
Let it wait.

1:15:41.338 --> 1:15:44.240
Let him play for his life!

1:15:47.575 --> 1:15:48.783
- Choose your game.

1:15:53.757 --> 1:15:55.218
- Rock, paper, scissors.

1:16:13.711 --> 1:16:14.842
- Come on Q.

1:16:17.209 --> 1:16:18.813
- Best two outta three.

1:16:20.883 --> 1:16:23.851
1, 2, 3, shoot.

1:16:24.887 --> 1:16:25.820
- Yes.

1:16:39.803 --> 1:16:42.133
- Do not lose this.

1:16:47.976 --> 1:16:50.438
- Come on Q, baby come on.

1:16:50.473 --> 1:16:51.648
- Okay, momma.

1:16:56.919 --> 1:17:00.690
- 1, 2, 3, shoot.

1:17:01.352 --> 1:17:02.483
- No!

1:17:06.863 --> 1:17:08.027
- Wait.

1:17:08.062 --> 1:17:09.325
Wait.

1:17:09.360 --> 1:17:10.832
Wait.
- Get him baby!

1:17:10.867 --> 1:17:11.833
Wait.

1:17:25.915 --> 1:17:27.376
- Final round.

1:17:28.544 --> 1:17:29.686
To the death.

1:17:31.184 --> 1:17:32.414
- Fine

1:17:33.791 --> 1:17:38.387
- 1, 2, 3 shoot.

1:17:39.687 --> 1:17:41.225
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:17:41.260 --> 1:17:44.624
- Get him baby.

1:17:47.200 --> 1:17:48.771
- No, no, no, no, no.

1:17:49.136 --> 1:17:51.532
-No, no.

1:18:02.710 --> 1:18:04.512
- Stop!

1:18:04.547 --> 1:18:08.054
Put the lighter the
fuck down right now!

1:18:08.089 --> 1:18:09.858
I will kill this
bitch, I swear to god.

1:18:12.654 --> 1:18:13.389
- Stop

1:18:13.424 --> 1:18:15.556
- No, you fucking stop!

1:18:16.724 --> 1:18:18.262
- No, grandma!

1:18:19.562 --> 1:18:22.431
Grandma, grandma!
- Look here, you okay?

1:18:22.466 --> 1:18:25.236
- Grandma, grandma, grandma.

1:18:27.911 --> 1:18:28.877
- You mother fucker!

1:18:28.912 --> 1:18:31.209
You mother fucker, die!

1:18:31.244 --> 1:18:36.412
- Mom! Mom!

1:18:38.086 --> 1:18:40.823
Mom, please no.

1:18:41.122 --> 1:18:42.286
No.

1:18:46.754 --> 1:18:47.764
- No baby, you go first.

1:18:59.767 --> 1:19:00.502
- Yes.

1:19:01.802 --> 1:19:02.339
Hey!

1:19:02.374 --> 1:19:03.208
Mom!

1:19:10.382 --> 1:19:11.711
Oh, I thought you quit.

1:19:16.784 --> 1:19:18.388
- I just did.

1:19:20.656 --> 1:19:22.491
- Run, run!

1:20:05.668 --> 1:20:06.304
Hey.

1:20:06.339 --> 1:20:07.338
- Hey.

1:20:09.078 --> 1:20:09.912
- Well.

1:20:11.014 --> 1:20:12.508
- Can't believe you're leaving.

1:20:13.742 --> 1:20:16.644
What am I gonna do without
my dishwasher?

1:20:16.679 --> 1:20:18.921
- Maybe get an
actual dishwasher.

1:20:22.850 --> 1:20:24.025
- You hungry baby?

1:20:24.060 --> 1:20:25.224
- Oh no. No, no, no.
- Want something to eat?

1:20:25.259 --> 1:20:26.522
- I'm not hungry.

1:20:27.261 --> 1:20:29.360
- Not even some goodbye cake.

1:20:29.890 --> 1:20:30.867
- Ma.

1:20:32.860 --> 1:20:34.904
- Okay, okay.

1:20:37.370 --> 1:20:39.799
I know, I said I
wasn't gonna do this.

1:20:42.243 --> 1:20:43.539
I'm just,

1:20:45.048 --> 1:20:46.443
I'm so proud of you.

1:20:54.882 --> 1:20:56.420
I'm gonna miss you.

1:20:59.458 --> 1:21:02.525
- Hey, can I come home
Friday for laundry?

1:21:02.560 --> 1:21:04.857
- My house is not
your laundry mat.

1:21:06.828 --> 1:21:07.937
- Okay.

1:21:07.972 --> 1:21:09.906
- Tell you what,
I'll play you for it.

1:21:10.975 --> 1:21:11.908
- Really?

1:21:13.802 --> 1:21:15.043
All right.

1:21:15.078 --> 1:21:16.407
You know what to do.

1:21:17.905 --> 1:21:20.081
- You about to get
your ass kicked.

1:21:21.348 --> 1:21:23.777
1, 2, 3 shoot.

1:21:26.122 --> 1:21:29.420
- Looks like I'm coming
home Friday with laundry.

1:21:30.291 --> 1:21:32.291
- You know I let you
win again, right?

1:21:32.326 --> 1:21:35.789
- Yeah, whatever.

1:21:36.594 --> 1:21:38.132
Okay.
All right.

1:21:39.762 --> 1:21:40.596
I'm out.

1:21:41.830 --> 1:21:43.863
- I'm proud of you.
- All right.

1:21:44.536 --> 1:21:46.107
- Okay.
- All right.

1:21:47.110 --> 1:21:47.944
Bye.

1:22:59.116 --> 1:23:03.217
- Ah.

1:23:05.012 --> 1:23:07.716
- Fortune can change
in an instant.

1:23:08.422 --> 1:23:10.323
Roll of the dice.

1:23:10.358 --> 1:23:12.589
The next card pull

1:23:12.624 --> 1:23:16.230
can win you all.

1:23:16.265 --> 1:23:19.167
Or cost you everything.

1:23:19.202 --> 1:23:24.271
And while our story is
now at it's conclusion,

1:23:24.306 --> 1:23:27.835
Bitch Ass will play again.

1:23:27.870 --> 1:23:32.543
The question is which one
of you will he choose?

1:23:33.117 --> 1:23:38.549
Which one of you will
be next?

1:23:39.288 --> 1:23:41.354
Till the next time.
