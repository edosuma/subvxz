00:00.160 --> 00:05.000
The following programme contains
strong language and violent scenes.

00:16.240 --> 00:18.960
Fucking hell...
They won't see me coming.

00:18.960 --> 00:20.200
That'll do.

00:20.200 --> 00:22.800
And trust me, one by one,
they will all go.

00:22.800 --> 00:24.320
What about Gene?

00:24.320 --> 00:26.280
He'll be the last to go.

00:26.280 --> 00:28.880
We were hoping that we pay
you on the back end.

00:28.880 --> 00:30.800
Very dangerous way to do business.

00:30.800 --> 00:33.480
Hashish.

00:36.400 --> 00:37.960
I like you, Gene...

00:39.000 --> 00:41.920
But you've got some balls asking for
half a ton of hashish

00:41.920 --> 00:43.640
on credit.
You can trust us.

00:43.640 --> 00:47.160
You get one chance to impress -
Tariq will supervise.

00:47.160 --> 00:49.280
He's got a back like pork crackling.

00:49.280 --> 00:51.280
Pig's back.

00:51.280 --> 00:53.440
The Mayor's in Morocco too.

00:53.440 --> 00:56.080
I need to get in front of him
about our planning permission.

00:56.080 --> 00:57.360
We'll get it back.

00:57.360 --> 00:58.880
Top of the pile again.

00:58.880 --> 01:01.160
That's why I'm so proud of you, Alb,

01:01.160 --> 01:03.760
for letting our boys spread
their wings.

01:03.760 --> 01:06.400
Dad got to the Moroccans
before I even met them.

01:06.400 --> 01:07.960
Made a bigger deal.

01:07.960 --> 01:10.000
If this goes wrong then we're dead.

01:10.880 --> 01:12.440
Just keep schtum, yeah.

01:12.440 --> 01:14.200
Is your brother,
Gene coming?

01:14.200 --> 01:16.200
- Gene?
- Yes.
No, he's not invited.

01:18.280 --> 01:20.440
Mum, somethings happened,
you need to come.

01:20.440 --> 01:21.480
What?

01:21.480 --> 01:23.080
I'm sorry.
Is he breathing?

01:23.080 --> 01:25.520
I'll fucking kill you.

01:29.480 --> 01:33.600
Now I lay me down to sleep,
I pray the lord my soul to keep...

01:35.480 --> 01:40.160
If I should die before I wake,
I pray the lord my soul to take.

01:44.600 --> 01:49.680
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep...

01:52.600 --> 01:57.760
If I should die before I wake
I pray the lord my soul to take.

02:01.440 --> 02:05.840
Now I lay me down to sleep
I pray the lord my soul to keep...

02:08.120 --> 02:11.120
If I should die before I wake...

02:15.080 --> 02:17.160
...I pray the lord my soul to take.

02:21.680 --> 02:26.160
♪ Eyes Without A Face - Billy Idol ♪
plays on stereo

02:37.760 --> 02:39.200
It's OK.

03:14.760 --> 03:16.320
Fucking Jesus...

03:20.120 --> 03:24.880
A couple of fireworks, I said.
Fuck sake...

03:24.880 --> 03:28.040
Where'd'you get 'em?
I'll leather the cowson!

03:28.040 --> 03:30.840
Ssshhh!

03:30.840 --> 03:34.640
That's our boy out there,
have some fucking respect!

03:35.880 --> 03:39.280
He's halfway back to Bermondsey
mum.

04:09.200 --> 04:11.640
Leave it Leonard!

04:11.640 --> 04:14.000
It's not gonna bring him back,
is it girl?!

04:57.960 --> 04:59.560
Eddie's taken it bad.

05:01.600 --> 05:06.000
Yeah... Yeah, it's thrown
us all, hasn't it?

05:06.000 --> 05:08.880
Poor kid must think we're
the worst family on earth.

05:12.720 --> 05:14.120
Thank you.

05:16.240 --> 05:18.200
For caring about us.

05:20.320 --> 05:21.840
Both of us.

05:36.920 --> 05:38.920
I'm so sorry for your loss, Leonard.

05:43.360 --> 05:44.720
I'm very sorry.

05:47.640 --> 05:50.080
I'm sweet... Where were we?

05:53.400 --> 05:56.880
Well, if you can deliver something
attractive and lucrative

05:56.880 --> 06:00.840
for my coast, and you have
the Gitanos' backing,

06:00.840 --> 06:02.720
then I'm prepared to support you.

06:03.840 --> 06:07.360
But I can't go against the wider
Alabasas community -

06:07.360 --> 06:09.960
you need their vote,
or it won't work.

06:10.920 --> 06:15.960
Our development would mean jobs,
cafes, shops -

06:15.960 --> 06:17.840
we're investing in their future.

06:19.880 --> 06:23.680
Locals have seen other people
swindled out of their homes.

06:23.680 --> 06:28.600
Ruthless developers like your uncle
Tony. People have long memories.

06:30.840 --> 06:32.720
You must convince them.

06:34.000 --> 06:37.480
I suggest an opening evening at the
town hall to introduce you

06:37.480 --> 06:39.040
to the community.

06:39.040 --> 06:41.000
So you can meet them in person.

06:41.000 --> 06:44.720
Just speak to them. As a neighbour.

06:45.880 --> 06:47.280
As a parent...

06:48.920 --> 06:51.160
How about tomorrow night?

06:51.160 --> 06:53.800
Sooner the better, right?
Whatever you say.

06:58.440 --> 07:00.760
Nice Bentley by the way.

07:00.760 --> 07:02.560
It's a roller actually.

07:06.880 --> 07:10.280
I know the timing couldn't
be worse for this deal...

07:11.160 --> 07:13.000
But tomorrow morning crack of dawn,

07:13.000 --> 07:16.040
there'll be a boatload of puff
landing on our beach here.

07:16.040 --> 07:19.840
Which we'll need to repack and get
on the road as soon as it gets dark.

07:19.840 --> 07:22.600
After that it's ten hours
to the French border,

07:22.600 --> 07:24.200
then it's a clear run to Holland,

07:24.200 --> 07:26.520
where we bust up our puff
from the Dutch.

07:26.520 --> 07:29.360
Our pals in Bermondsey will
take it from there.

07:29.360 --> 07:30.840
This is the big league now.

07:31.960 --> 07:34.160
Gotta think big.
Bigger than oranges.

07:34.160 --> 07:36.760
Get this right
and the Lords are back.

07:36.760 --> 07:39.000
Yeah, yeah I'll make you right Dad.

07:39.000 --> 07:40.880
And look,
I'm tight with the Gitanos,

07:40.880 --> 07:42.560
so I'll make sure
there's bodies there.

07:42.560 --> 07:44.160
Lola's already sending who she can.

07:44.160 --> 07:46.000
So she fucking should,
the slice she's on.

07:46.000 --> 07:47.520
What about us girls?

07:47.520 --> 07:50.040
It's gotta look right
if the police come knocking.

07:50.040 --> 07:52.920
We're a house in mourning, remember?

07:52.920 --> 07:54.800
We're hardly likely to forget.

07:55.760 --> 07:58.800
Running puff, with my Anthony still
fucking warm-

07:58.800 --> 08:01.240
If I've gotta be OK with it,
then so do you.

08:01.240 --> 08:03.200
Yeah, there's a snag, though.

08:03.200 --> 08:07.320
This erm, mayor wants me at a town
hall meeting to grease the locals.

08:07.320 --> 08:10.280
Tomorrow night, same time as
we are moving the puff.

08:10.280 --> 08:12.120
Me and Carly, all smiles.

08:12.120 --> 08:13.800
Shouldn't Gene be there?

08:13.800 --> 08:17.600
Nah, Len'll do it. People like
someone you can relate to.

08:23.080 --> 08:26.200
Yeah. Crack on Len.
You know what you're doing.

08:29.520 --> 08:31.000
Dad, if Len's not going to be there,

08:31.000 --> 08:33.920
I should drive the truck with
the puff in.

08:33.920 --> 08:35.720
Let's just keep it simple shall we.

08:35.720 --> 08:38.760
Gene's gonna fucking side door me if
I don't do that.

08:38.760 --> 08:40.960
I'm not side dooring you.
You are.

08:40.960 --> 08:42.760
So you'll keep down the coast.

08:42.760 --> 08:45.440
Yeah, it's the route
the Dutch have always used.

08:45.440 --> 08:48.400
If that truck doesn't make it
to Holland, we're dead.

08:48.400 --> 08:49.920
All of us.

08:52.040 --> 08:55.000
Do you know what serendipity is?

08:57.240 --> 08:59.320
It's how I feel about
you being here.

09:01.280 --> 09:02.840
It's meant to be.

09:05.800 --> 09:10.320
You're such a lovely boy,
such a support.

09:12.000 --> 09:14.680
I dunno what I'd have done these
past few days.

09:20.160 --> 09:25.040
I swear to God Eddie,
we're not bad people.

09:29.880 --> 09:31.920
I'm sorry about what happened.

09:34.600 --> 09:38.640
All this when you've only just
got settled.

09:38.640 --> 09:41.240
Moved from pillar to post
your whole life.

09:42.640 --> 09:45.000
And you better hope
you like your family,

09:45.000 --> 09:46.760
cause they're all you had.

09:49.880 --> 09:51.760
I hated mine.

09:53.880 --> 09:55.800
The grubby fuckers.

09:58.280 --> 10:03.040
So I made my own. Mmm?

10:03.040 --> 10:07.320
One with a solid mum and dad who'd
kill for their kids if they had to.

10:09.680 --> 10:11.720
I hardly remember my dad.

10:12.880 --> 10:14.360
C'mere boy.

10:16.560 --> 10:19.560
I won't let anything happen to you,
so help me.

10:20.600 --> 10:22.360
Do you hear me, Edward?

10:24.560 --> 10:27.000
This family looks after its own.

10:27.920 --> 10:29.680
And you're one of us now.

10:32.920 --> 10:34.680
Best crack on.

10:36.880 --> 10:40.040
There's a few of his bits and
pieces here you might like.

10:40.040 --> 10:42.240
Anthony would want you to have 'em.

10:55.120 --> 10:56.520
I'll fucking kill you.

10:59.680 --> 11:01.600
Kill every last one of them.

11:06.200 --> 11:08.160
Oi.

11:08.160 --> 11:10.360
Where'd you get that, mush?

11:10.360 --> 11:12.160
Your mum gave it to me.

11:15.840 --> 11:17.880
What happened, Eddie?

11:17.880 --> 11:20.240
What?
Why did Ant go wandering?

11:20.240 --> 11:22.360
I dunno-
Was there a bird he was chasing?

11:22.360 --> 11:23.800
No, no-
Was he off his nut?

11:23.800 --> 11:25.640
I don't, I-
Did he have agg with someone?

11:25.640 --> 11:27.520
I don't-
Tell me the fucking truth!

11:27.520 --> 11:30.000
Oi! Len, leave him!

11:30.000 --> 11:32.360
Eddie's hurting too, you know?

11:32.360 --> 11:34.520
Yeah.

11:34.520 --> 11:38.360
Shit, I just want to know the truth,
you know?

11:38.360 --> 11:40.120
Going fucking doolally.

11:44.200 --> 11:46.000
We'll figure it out.

11:49.760 --> 11:51.760
Are you OK?

11:51.760 --> 11:54.480
I can't even look him
in the fucking eye.

11:54.480 --> 11:58.080
Well you have to try, Ed.
Our lives depend on it.

12:02.600 --> 12:03.960
Gene loves you.

12:04.840 --> 12:06.240
He doesn't know me.

12:06.240 --> 12:10.440
He didn't kill Dad. You said it
yourself, he wasn't there.

12:10.440 --> 12:12.200
He's a fucking Lord.

12:14.640 --> 12:18.120
These animals took
everything from us.

12:19.360 --> 12:21.000
They deserve what they get.

12:22.880 --> 12:24.960
So you gonna kill 'em off,
one by one?

12:27.680 --> 12:31.360
Listen to me. I know you're scared.

12:33.040 --> 12:35.200
But I'm gonna be careful, I promise.

12:37.680 --> 12:40.720
You're my reason for living.

12:41.920 --> 12:43.760
I'm not gonna mess it up again.

12:47.560 --> 12:50.360
Anthony was a horrible little bully.

12:51.680 --> 12:53.800
Good fucking riddance to him.

12:57.960 --> 13:00.280
Aren't you scared
you're going to hell?

13:03.400 --> 13:06.160
Where do you think I've been
for the last ten years?

13:26.160 --> 13:28.480
Come on Len.
Yeah. Yeah. I am coming dad.

13:28.480 --> 13:31.400
These drugs won't unload themselves.
Right come on boys.

13:31.400 --> 13:33.760
Tell you what, I'm going to buy
a Porsche Targa as soon as

13:33.760 --> 13:34.880
we've got some dough.

13:34.880 --> 13:38.080
Probably get a soft top you know...
A nice little red one.

13:38.080 --> 13:40.040
Just calm down Kel, for fuck's sake.

13:40.040 --> 13:42.320
I need you on it boys, right? Ready?

13:43.920 --> 13:46.120
This time next week,
we will be fucking caked...

13:46.120 --> 13:47.920
I can smell the readies.

14:35.600 --> 14:37.320
I see them.

14:41.640 --> 14:43.920
♪ I Ran - A Flock of Seagulls ♪

15:02.200 --> 15:05.600
Remember what Amira said.
No fuck ups.

15:05.600 --> 15:06.920
No surprises.

16:15.360 --> 16:18.040
Oi, what you doing, flirting,
when we're on a job?

16:18.040 --> 16:20.480
The Dutch boys are ready for
us at the warehouse.

16:20.480 --> 16:22.200
Just saying hello Gene...

16:22.200 --> 16:24.640
Listen, I need you on it, Kell.

16:24.640 --> 16:27.120
You won't let me
ride in the fucking truck,

16:27.120 --> 16:28.920
like I'm a child or something.

16:28.920 --> 16:30.720
Yeah you wonder why mate. Yeah.

16:33.200 --> 16:37.000
Yeah, thought so. What a prick, eh?

16:37.000 --> 16:41.720
Hmm, I thought your
brother was the boss, no?

16:41.720 --> 16:43.440
Oh, you mean Gene?
Mm-hmm.

16:43.440 --> 16:45.800
Na, nah, he's just a fucking kid.

16:45.800 --> 16:47.560
Kel, shut it, will ya.

16:59.720 --> 17:01.120
Come in.

17:03.720 --> 17:07.360
So kind of you to visit Senor Diego.

17:07.360 --> 17:09.760
Senora...

17:09.760 --> 17:12.680
from my family to yours...

17:16.880 --> 17:18.920
Gracias, Senor Diego.

17:18.920 --> 17:21.040
When the flowers die,
you can keep the pot.

17:21.040 --> 17:23.960
I made it with my own hand.
Oh, yeah.

17:32.560 --> 17:36.520
Sorry, it's just so much
has changed, so quickly.

17:38.120 --> 17:41.040
I pretty much raised
that boy myself.

17:42.880 --> 17:47.880
We'll keep you in our
prayers Senora.

17:47.880 --> 17:51.240
Thank you again.

18:05.480 --> 18:07.920
Carl... Carl...?

18:10.880 --> 18:14.360
You're not really going to this town
hall thing tonight are ya?

18:15.480 --> 18:19.360
Can't let Leonard down.
Gotta look my best tonight.

18:20.720 --> 18:25.040
I'm not being funny Carls,
but are you sure you're up to it?

18:26.080 --> 18:31.120
The family needs Leonard
and Leonard needs me.

18:31.120 --> 18:32.880
His nerves are shot.

18:32.880 --> 18:35.360
Public events ain't his bag.

18:35.360 --> 18:38.360
And he's bottling it all up,
as usual.

18:46.320 --> 18:50.960
It's not- it's not healthy,
is it Cind?

18:50.960 --> 18:54.360
All that pain rotting away
inside him.

18:55.520 --> 18:57.320
It'll give him cancer.

18:59.320 --> 19:00.920
And then I'll have no one.

19:05.120 --> 19:08.040
Shit. Oh fuck...
It's alright, it's OK, it's OK.

19:11.520 --> 19:13.640
The hurt won't ever go away.

19:16.240 --> 19:18.040
But you'll learn to live with it.

19:20.680 --> 19:22.000
You have to.

19:25.600 --> 19:27.160
C'mere.

19:27.160 --> 19:29.960
What a mess.
No, no, you're fine.

19:31.760 --> 19:33.560
Look, sod the town hall.

19:33.560 --> 19:37.360
I'll go, I'll look after Leonard,

19:37.360 --> 19:41.760
you stay here, you lock
the door and have a big old cry.

19:41.760 --> 19:43.360
You need it.

19:44.880 --> 19:46.960
I'm not gonna take no for an answer.

19:49.640 --> 19:51.720
Yeah.
Yeah.

19:59.760 --> 20:01.560
Cindy Carter my ass.

20:05.000 --> 20:07.520
That woman is Mercy Winters.

20:08.800 --> 20:11.400
Banged up for ten years
on a firearms charge.

20:11.400 --> 20:14.600
When she got out of the nick,
Winters-Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

20:14.600 --> 20:16.480
I have no idea what you're saying.

20:16.480 --> 20:18.440
Fuck sake. Give me strength.

20:19.920 --> 20:25.040
Winters was released,
squeaky clean,

20:25.040 --> 20:26.880
never committed another offence,

20:26.880 --> 20:30.160
until her new fella,
Gene Lord...

20:32.080 --> 20:34.680
...mowed down my partner
Russo in cold blood.

20:38.600 --> 20:40.240
My condolences.

20:40.240 --> 20:42.360
But d'you think she threw her
hands up in horror,

20:42.360 --> 20:44.720
our Miss Winters, newly reformed
character that she is?

20:44.720 --> 20:48.080
No she did not; she's done
the slips with him to Spain.

20:50.560 --> 20:53.760
Mercy Winters is
an accessory to murder.

20:55.880 --> 20:58.400
In your opinion.
Yes, in my opinion.

21:02.400 --> 21:04.440
In my expert opinion!

21:09.400 --> 21:10.680
Jesus, wept.

21:11.760 --> 21:15.520
D'you know if I was a bloke and
I'd come over here to bring

21:15.520 --> 21:17.920
Gene Lord in on my own I'd get
a fucking commendation

21:17.920 --> 21:21.320
and a first class seat on
the plane to get the job done.

21:21.320 --> 21:24.920
As it stands,
I'm just a liability with tits.

21:32.520 --> 21:33.920
Hold on a minute.

21:36.640 --> 21:39.640
Perhaps it may interest you to know
that the Lords are planning

21:39.640 --> 21:42.920
to settle here,
to become hoteliers.

21:44.000 --> 21:47.120
They'll be greasing the locals at
the town hall tonight.

21:50.040 --> 21:53.760
♪ Money - The Flying Lizards ♪

22:11.640 --> 22:15.120

22:56.480 --> 22:58.320
Let's dirty it up a bit, alright?

22:59.520 --> 23:03.080
Look Dad, new logo for the oranges,
new plates.

23:06.080 --> 23:09.240
You err, used these trucks before?
Many times.

23:09.240 --> 23:12.440
We maintain it ourselves and it's
er, it's been really lucky for us.

23:12.440 --> 23:14.800
Yeah, well we don't deal with
luck in south London, mush.

23:14.800 --> 23:18.520
This is the same method we've
always used, tried and tested.

23:18.520 --> 23:20.040
That's exactly my point.

23:20.040 --> 23:22.000
Gavvers will be on you,
I am telling ya,

23:22.000 --> 23:24.760
if you keep doing the same route
at the same time.

23:24.760 --> 23:28.040
Which is why we should go now.
While it's still light.

23:30.160 --> 23:35.240
It's exactly like we do back in
Bermo - last minute switcheroo.

23:35.240 --> 23:38.600
You fuck with the times,
you fuck with the transport,

23:38.600 --> 23:41.320
leaves any clever gavvers with their
cock in their hands,

23:41.320 --> 23:44.080
while the generals, they're the only
ones who know the apple.

23:44.080 --> 23:46.560
You see where I'm going with this, son?

23:46.560 --> 23:48.040
Not really...

23:48.040 --> 23:49.960
But if there are going
to be changes,

23:49.960 --> 23:52.440
I will have to inform Amira.
Don't need to do that Tariq.

23:52.440 --> 23:54.880
Boy's right. Outside the inner
circle, what's the point?

23:54.880 --> 23:59.600
No Dad, I mean, it's worth
discussing strategy for the future,

23:59.600 --> 24:01.640
but this time there's no need.

24:01.640 --> 24:05.320
We're sticking to the plan, alright?
The plan we agreed together.

24:08.280 --> 24:12.880
Mr Lord,
Amira doesn't like surprises.

24:12.880 --> 24:14.360
Who does, mush?

24:15.680 --> 24:17.280
Who fucking does?

24:29.360 --> 24:31.840
So, you and Len go to
the town hall

24:31.840 --> 24:34.120
the rest of you back to
the warehouse?

24:34.120 --> 24:36.160
Eddie and me will hold
the fort here.

24:39.040 --> 24:40.280
Eddie.

24:42.080 --> 24:44.240
Poor boy. Too young for this.

24:45.200 --> 24:46.800
You think you're
the bollocks,

24:46.800 --> 24:48.880
but don't come crying to me
when you get nicked.

24:48.880 --> 24:51.040
Can't just throw a new idea in
without telling me.

24:51.040 --> 24:54.200
'New idea'? I've been working
the switch since before you were
born, son.

24:54.200 --> 24:55.640
Working the switch.

24:55.640 --> 24:57.880
Yeah, with fur coats
and snide kettles, Dad,

24:57.880 --> 24:59.440
not millions of pounds
worth of puff.

24:59.440 --> 25:01.000
You've come a long way son,

25:01.000 --> 25:03.200
for someone who
hasn't even fucking started yet.

25:03.200 --> 25:04.680
I'm having a fucking go, eh?!

25:04.680 --> 25:06.760
You're a mug, Gene,
I'm sorry to say it.

25:06.760 --> 25:08.200
Alb.
Well it's true,

25:08.200 --> 25:10.840
first he nearly fucks the deal-
That was you...

25:11.680 --> 25:13.560
...getting in the middle while I was
in Morocco

25:13.560 --> 25:15.880
and doubling the fucking order...
Gene, what did I say?!

25:15.880 --> 25:18.520
See, this is what I'm talking about
being muggish, alright?

25:18.520 --> 25:21.000
We could have the lot, son.

25:21.000 --> 25:23.680
If I hadn't jumped in, you'd have
pissed it up the wall

25:23.680 --> 25:25.160
with your two bob deal making,

25:25.160 --> 25:28.280
bowing and scraping to some toot
in a veil.

25:29.720 --> 25:31.680
You don't know how to think big, boy.

25:31.680 --> 25:34.640
You stupid, racist, fuck-
Gene, nitto.

25:34.640 --> 25:36.320
'Some toot in a veil'?

25:37.960 --> 25:40.600
These people are dangerous
you arrogant fucking prick.

25:40.600 --> 25:42.080
You could've got me killed. Gene.

25:42.080 --> 25:43.920
You want to see dangerous.
What you gonna do?

25:43.920 --> 25:46.480
You wanna fucking see dangerous?!
What you gonna fucking do?!

25:46.480 --> 25:48.600
I'll fucking show you,
you fucking...

25:48.600 --> 25:50.440
Gene, for fucks sake.
Get the fuck off me!

25:50.440 --> 25:53.360
Go on, go inside.
You just stay out of my fucking way!

25:53.360 --> 25:55.480
You fucking washed up old prick.

25:55.480 --> 25:57.400
Gene. Just leave it. Go inside.

25:59.920 --> 26:01.680
Fucking prick.

26:03.120 --> 26:04.960
Come on, look at the state of you.

26:04.960 --> 26:06.520
Right give me your hand.

26:06.520 --> 26:07.960
Give me your hand.

26:07.960 --> 26:09.680
Don't just stand there mate.

26:11.680 --> 26:13.800
Where the fucking hell were you,
eh?!

26:13.800 --> 26:18.080
What were you fucking doing? You let
him humiliate me! Humiliate me!

26:19.680 --> 26:21.440
I'll fucking destroy him.

26:30.000 --> 26:31.360
You OK?

26:34.120 --> 26:36.920
Mum... I can't watch you do this.

26:39.280 --> 26:41.200
Well you ain't gonna stop me.

26:45.640 --> 26:46.880
Gene!

26:48.200 --> 26:49.880
Gene!

26:54.360 --> 26:56.040
What have I done Cind?

26:57.200 --> 26:58.880
You stood up to him...

26:58.880 --> 27:00.480
And about time.

27:03.360 --> 27:04.840
Shit...

27:06.120 --> 27:07.600
You OK boy?

27:09.960 --> 27:11.440
I'm sorry Mum.

27:21.920 --> 27:27.240
That was the funniest thing I have
ever fucking seen.

27:29.520 --> 27:31.640
Him falling in the drink like that.

27:33.640 --> 27:37.080
He had it coming.
Yeah, the way he talks to you.

27:37.080 --> 27:39.040
Exactly.

27:39.040 --> 27:40.600
This close, Mum.

27:40.600 --> 27:44.200
Then finish what you started Gene.
Only you can do it.

27:45.280 --> 27:47.760
She's right babe, only you.

27:49.040 --> 27:54.400
But first, you gotta make it right
with your Dad, just for now.

27:55.560 --> 27:57.760
Just until the readies
start coming in.

28:00.400 --> 28:03.720
Sweet.

28:03.720 --> 28:05.720
Yeah, sweet.

28:44.960 --> 28:46.520
I'm sorry, Dad.

28:53.960 --> 28:55.600
It's gotta stop, boy.

28:57.160 --> 28:58.800
Us, at war.

29:02.640 --> 29:04.440
I was always so hard on you.

29:06.360 --> 29:09.040
I just didn't think you were tough
enough, so I pushed,

29:09.040 --> 29:11.200
and I'm still pushing.

29:13.040 --> 29:15.240
But what I didn't see...

29:16.440 --> 29:18.200
...is that you've got it.

29:20.360 --> 29:24.640
You've always had it, you just
need your time to shine.

29:24.640 --> 29:26.880
I only have it because of you. No.

29:29.840 --> 29:31.760
Let me say what's fair.

29:35.120 --> 29:36.640
You had a vision.

29:37.760 --> 29:40.280
Something far greater
than I could see.

29:40.280 --> 29:44.120
It's you who can turn this family's
fortunes around. It's you Gene.

29:48.080 --> 29:50.200
Then let's do this tonight,
me and you.

29:50.200 --> 29:54.360
No.
Father and son, side by side, yeah?

29:55.960 --> 29:57.360
You crack on.

29:58.480 --> 30:01.920
It's your time.
I've done my bit.

30:04.840 --> 30:06.080
You mean that?

30:06.080 --> 30:09.520
Go on, fuck off
and make this family rich boy.

30:11.960 --> 30:14.080
See you when you're back
from Holland.

30:22.560 --> 30:24.040
I love you Dad.

30:26.120 --> 30:27.640
You too boy.

31:16.880 --> 31:18.720
You'll fucking see.

31:30.760 --> 31:33.200
You see anything coming,
you radio in.

31:33.200 --> 31:34.760
You're on look-out duty.

31:36.200 --> 31:37.840
This radio's fucking shit.

31:40.360 --> 31:42.680
I'd be better use in the truck.

31:42.680 --> 31:44.400
You're not going in the truck.
Why?

31:44.400 --> 31:47.480
I already told you why,
the Dutch know the road.

31:47.480 --> 31:49.640
Why don't you just admit
you don't trust me?

31:49.640 --> 31:52.240
Why would I Kell, mm?

31:53.320 --> 31:56.360
I ask you to keep it sweet while I'm
in Morocco and by the time I'm back,

31:56.360 --> 31:59.240
you've grassed to Dad
and Anthony's fucking dead.

31:59.240 --> 32:01.200
You blaming me for Anthony now?

32:02.200 --> 32:05.840
Just do your job, mate.
You see any gavvers, you radio in.

32:08.080 --> 32:10.680
Who do you think you are,
Ronnie fucking Biggs.

32:16.600 --> 32:18.880
Don't worry about him, Tariq.
It'll be sweet.

32:33.360 --> 32:37.440
Alright, we are good.
Sit down.

32:42.880 --> 32:45.320
Here make yourself comfortable.
Thank you.

32:58.480 --> 32:59.720
Alright.

33:00.880 --> 33:02.440
Prick.

33:02.440 --> 33:06.680
Hey, it's supposed to be a charm
offensive. It's not offensive charm.

33:06.680 --> 33:08.120
Lighten up yeah.

33:11.720 --> 33:13.680
Hi there, you look lovely.

33:21.000 --> 33:23.920
Seven?
Yeah.

33:33.160 --> 33:35.080
Least the clouds'll give us cover.

33:36.760 --> 33:39.360
If a storm comes,
the roads may flood.

33:42.200 --> 33:43.800
All must be considered.

33:46.480 --> 33:48.120
Hey there, you look lovely.

33:51.000 --> 33:52.840
Hi, hello, thanks for coming.

33:52.840 --> 33:54.160
Buenos tares.

33:55.160 --> 33:57.320
Hello. Thanks for coming.

33:59.440 --> 34:01.040
Hi there, I'm Len.

34:01.040 --> 34:03.280
Hi you're a lucky man,
she's beautiful.

34:07.400 --> 34:10.040
Right, it's getting dark,
let's move.

34:14.800 --> 34:16.760
Hello mate... Leonard.

34:26.320 --> 34:27.520
We're go.

34:53.120 --> 34:55.240
Here babes come on, suck on that.

35:00.160 --> 35:04.000
That's a joke - suck on that -
you got it, yeah?

35:04.000 --> 35:05.480
Hmmm...

35:05.480 --> 35:08.840
This is Gene and Tariq at the rear.
Kell. We're all set.

35:08.840 --> 35:10.960
Let me know
when you got eyes on the cargo.

35:10.960 --> 35:13.160
Coast is clear. Relax Gene.

35:27.280 --> 35:31.320
Senor Lord is here to tell you that
the hotel complex

35:31.320 --> 35:33.400
his family intends-

35:39.000 --> 35:41.400
They want you to speak to them.
I'll translate-

35:41.400 --> 35:42.960
What? No...

35:42.960 --> 35:45.760
Fear not. Just be yourself.

35:45.760 --> 35:47.160
You must be fucking joking.

35:47.160 --> 35:50.240
They're neighbours; good,
hard-working people,

35:50.240 --> 35:51.760
parents.

35:53.320 --> 35:54.720
Speak from the heart.

36:05.000 --> 36:06.600
Um...

36:07.480 --> 36:09.480
I'm not used to public speaking.

36:13.720 --> 36:18.160
But I understand you need to know
if you can trust us or not.

36:19.880 --> 36:23.640
It's true my late uncle Tony
didn't always do right by you.

36:25.320 --> 36:26.800
Hijo de puta!

36:28.320 --> 36:31.160
But my family now. We have a dream.

36:32.160 --> 36:35.320
To build paradise right here
in Alabasas.

36:46.400 --> 36:48.160
Paradise my ass!

36:51.120 --> 36:55.120
Our architect, Emilio Suarez, is...

36:55.120 --> 36:58.400
...he's Costa born and bred,
so he knows this land.

36:59.640 --> 37:01.240
And that's what we want.

37:01.240 --> 37:02.560
Cabron!

37:05.880 --> 37:07.440
This coast is special.

37:08.520 --> 37:14.160
And, well, we think we can make it
profitable as well as special.

37:15.720 --> 37:17.040
For all of us.

37:17.960 --> 37:21.240
You English will run away with the
profit like you always do.

37:21.240 --> 37:24.480
I've never run away from anything.
Nor has anyone in my family.

37:24.480 --> 37:26.840
My own son's buried here.

37:37.200 --> 37:39.160
My own son's buried here.

37:40.960 --> 37:43.040
So me and my wife...

37:44.840 --> 37:48.720
We'll never leave him.
He's part of this land now.

37:48.720 --> 37:51.240
Like your own dead.

37:51.240 --> 37:54.080
And I swear to you
we will honour them.

37:57.000 --> 37:59.320
So tell us, Senor.

37:59.320 --> 38:03.160
Tell us how we will profit
from your development?

38:07.360 --> 38:09.960
We'll hire locally.

38:10.920 --> 38:14.880
That means construction, labour,
hotel staff,

38:14.880 --> 38:16.800
leisure sub-contractors.

39:15.800 --> 39:19.920
I was thinking like... Maybe we
could go to dinner one night?

39:21.040 --> 39:23.200
Club Paradiso, you know?

39:23.200 --> 39:26.840
I can get us a reem table,
sit front of house, the whole thing.

39:27.840 --> 39:29.520
What d'you think?
Hmm...

39:29.520 --> 39:31.280
Yeah?
Kenny, pick up.

39:35.320 --> 39:40.520
Club Paradiso? I'd love that,
but they don't allow Gitanos.

39:41.480 --> 39:44.800
They say we're dirty.
I bet you are.

39:46.800 --> 39:48.400
Nah, nah, I'm just...

39:49.640 --> 39:52.760
Anyway, they'll let you in if you're
wrapped around me,

39:52.760 --> 39:55.840
'cause, you know, otherwise I'll
weigh 'em in, won't I?

39:57.400 --> 39:59.360
Kell, pick up for fuck's sake.

40:00.960 --> 40:03.480
I think he can live without me
for the minute, don't you?

40:04.720 --> 40:09.680
Are you not going to answer?
Nah, he's a mug anyway, so...

40:10.800 --> 40:13.120
He's not a mug, he's a cool guy.

40:16.480 --> 40:17.840
Yeah...

40:19.920 --> 40:21.920
Great at everything, isn't he?

40:28.240 --> 40:29.840
Fuck sake.

40:34.680 --> 40:36.000
Knock knock.

40:37.480 --> 40:38.920
Hello there.

40:40.240 --> 40:41.760
You alright?

40:43.360 --> 40:46.320
Cindy.
How the fuck do you know my name?

40:49.280 --> 40:50.560
Hmm.

40:55.440 --> 40:57.400
Impressive speech, eh?

40:57.400 --> 40:59.440
Mm, yeah, yeah, zinger.

41:00.320 --> 41:05.840
Poor fella, losing his son like
that? I can't imagine.

41:05.840 --> 41:07.880
I don't think
I'd ever get over that.

41:09.640 --> 41:11.680
I haven't seen you round
here before?

41:13.000 --> 41:14.880
Long way from home, me.

41:14.880 --> 41:17.920
Well, I just came for the free vino.

41:19.040 --> 41:22.840
But I have got an open ended ticket,

41:22.840 --> 41:25.560
so you might see me around kid.

41:36.880 --> 41:39.680
Kell come in for fucks' sake.

41:39.680 --> 41:41.800
Can we send the truck through,
or not?

41:59.320 --> 42:02.560
Luuk, Metin. Watch out.
We haven't got an update.

42:24.200 --> 42:25.800
You want a little er...

42:28.040 --> 42:30.360
Huh? You up for some of that?

42:31.640 --> 42:34.040
You're nice, Kelly...

42:34.040 --> 42:35.920
...but it's your brother I like.

42:38.640 --> 42:40.200
Are you serious?

42:42.920 --> 42:45.200
Kelly, no.

42:46.480 --> 42:49.360
Come here!
You can't like him more than me!

42:49.360 --> 42:51.960
You can't!

42:57.560 --> 43:00.200
Just be quiet! Shut up!

43:07.400 --> 43:08.720
Shhh, Manuela!

43:13.840 --> 43:18.280
Just stop! Stop lying. Stop lying!

43:18.280 --> 43:23.280
Stop lying. Stop lying.

43:33.440 --> 43:37.320
Stop lying. Stop lying.
It's alright.

43:38.560 --> 43:40.600

43:51.520 --> 43:52.800
With ice.

43:54.160 --> 43:56.440
There's a storm coming...

43:57.520 --> 44:01.360
...you'll get fuckin' soaked.
I'm rather enjoying it.

44:01.360 --> 44:04.360
And oi, there's a mess
in the front room.

44:04.360 --> 44:05.800
Clean it up, will you?

44:18.000 --> 44:20.480
Kelly, this is urgent.
Is the coast clear?

44:22.560 --> 44:24.280
Gene.

44:24.280 --> 44:25.480
Gene.

44:26.520 --> 44:29.680
