00:12.721 --> 00:13.638
God!

00:14.013 --> 00:15.640
Susglamon glabbi blah!

00:30.321 --> 00:31.448
- Pay up.
- What?

00:31.448 --> 00:34.033
Pay up, g-slice.
I just finished your chores.

00:34.033 --> 00:35.702
Didn’t I just upgrade your ponytail?

00:35.702 --> 00:38.079
And those ghost goggles you asked
for are in the vending machine.

00:38.079 --> 00:39.122
Attribute slider.

00:39.581 --> 00:40.331
Oh shit.

00:40.331 --> 00:42.584
Jimmy Haddicker’s frisbee golf
party is tonight,

00:42.584 --> 00:45.837
I want him sliding
all over these attributes.

00:49.966 --> 00:51.259
Sensitive bone marrow much?

00:51.593 --> 00:53.344
Alright! What are we boosting,
what are we losing?

00:53.344 --> 00:55.889
Strength me up dawg,
I want that frolf bod.

00:55.889 --> 00:56.973
Drop intelligence.

00:56.973 --> 01:00.059
Alright! Four customizable stats,
courtesy of the genetic sequencer

01:00.059 --> 01:01.186
- in your...
- Come here, nerd.

01:01.561 --> 01:04.522
No! Summer!
I will literally murder you!

01:04.522 --> 01:06.775
Christ!
You’re too dumb to know I’m serious.

01:06.775 --> 01:07.817
Rick, what are you...

01:08.485 --> 01:11.571
Wait, is that an attribute slider?
You’re juicing your stats

01:11.571 --> 01:13.740
- for the frolf party?
- You gonna ruin this for me?

01:13.740 --> 01:16.493
What? No!
I want one for the party too!

01:16.493 --> 01:17.827
Do some shit for me, bro.

01:17.827 --> 01:20.163
I helped you kill your nemesis?

01:20.163 --> 01:21.289
You guys found him?

01:21.289 --> 01:24.584
It’s my emotional cheat day, I am
removing myself from this conversation.

01:25.752 --> 01:28.838
I can’t believe he gave you that.
I’ve asked for one forever.

01:28.838 --> 01:31.841
Cuz you’re a bottomfeeder, Morty.
You beg and eat scraps.

01:31.841 --> 01:34.052
I’m an independent woman
who eats what she kills.

01:34.052 --> 01:36.346
Come on, Summer!
I’m your little brother,

01:36.346 --> 01:38.848
- you have to take care of me!
- Take care of this.

01:40.809 --> 01:43.019
- You just hide anywhere?
<i>- Kick his ass, Summer!</i>

02:18.471 --> 02:21.850
- My god, who are you?
- But what about this?

02:21.850 --> 02:24.602
- She’s juggling!
- With balls!

02:24.602 --> 02:28.064
Bro, is that your sister?
Her dexterity is wild.

02:28.064 --> 02:29.524
I guess?

02:29.524 --> 02:31.693
Brad, aren’t you a football guy?

02:31.693 --> 02:35.321
Of course, Morty.
But the off season, is the frolf season.

02:35.989 --> 02:38.241
Yo Summer! Get over here
and meet the team captain.

02:41.494 --> 02:44.080
Hey guys! So random seeing you here.

02:44.080 --> 02:47.584
Love the way you move that coin.
Ever consider a bigger disc?

02:47.584 --> 02:48.710
Is your hair different?

02:49.043 --> 02:52.463
I dunno, I started using this
new leave-in conditioner?

02:52.463 --> 02:53.548
I love it.

02:53.548 --> 02:56.551
Maybe leave your number in my phone.

02:56.551 --> 02:57.844
So charismatic!

02:58.177 --> 02:59.929
Looks like we found
our new center-forwardback.

02:59.929 --> 03:03.933
Gross! She’s just using tech to
customize herself for social situations!

03:03.933 --> 03:06.895
Bro, maybe you should too.
You’re harshing the buzz.

03:06.895 --> 03:07.937
Can you give us a sec?

03:09.689 --> 03:13.151
You’re embarrassing yourself.
Leave or I will make you leave.

03:13.151 --> 03:15.028
Just let me borrow it for a second,
then I’ll go.

03:15.028 --> 03:16.529
What do you even want it for,
you parasite?

03:16.529 --> 03:19.657
I wanna be ripped and take my shirt
off in front of Tricia!

03:19.657 --> 03:23.244
You worm! She’s my best friend.
She’s not even in your grade.

03:23.244 --> 03:26.205
It’s a trickle down effect.
She’ll see me and tell everyone.

03:26.205 --> 03:27.248
Okay, time to go.

03:30.627 --> 03:33.296
She’s juicing!
The device makes her cool!

03:33.296 --> 03:34.797
Go Summer! Go Summer!

03:34.797 --> 03:36.382
Juice it up!

03:39.135 --> 03:44.015
Not so strong now!
Good luck with intelligence. My turn.

03:47.727 --> 03:48.811
That’s more like it.

03:48.811 --> 03:50.855
Morty! Wait until the girls hear this.

03:51.189 --> 03:52.732
Let’s see if these abs are waterproof.

04:06.621 --> 04:09.290
- Smart throw.
- Really thought out.

04:09.290 --> 04:12.377
- Now this is some shit.
- This is what frolf is about, bro!

04:12.377 --> 04:15.296
You pubescent little simian,
I will end you.

04:15.296 --> 04:17.423
- Fight!
- Fight right now!

04:32.647 --> 04:35.024
Okay. No. Not what frolf is about.

04:35.024 --> 04:38.194
Open your mind!

04:38.194 --> 04:40.196
Oh my god, what the fuck?

04:40.196 --> 04:41.948
No thank yew.

04:41.948 --> 04:44.325
Dude, no way. Summer’s got a kuato!

04:44.325 --> 04:46.619
- A what?
- A kuato?

04:46.619 --> 04:49.122
Oh my God!
She doesn’t even know what a kuato is!

04:49.122 --> 04:51.416
I know what that is,
I’m cool!

04:51.416 --> 04:52.917
Jimmy, your leave-in conditioner!

04:54.210 --> 04:56.004
Look at how desperate she is!

04:56.004 --> 04:58.881
- Boo!
- Come on, guys: Boo her!

04:58.881 --> 05:04.095
- Boo! You ruined everything!
- You suck, Summer!

05:05.013 --> 05:07.265
<i>And now back to... Cake Or Fake?</i>

05:07.724 --> 05:12.103
<i>Please! Come on, you have to know!
Do I not breathe? Do I not speak?</i>

05:12.562 --> 05:13.646
- Give me the knife.
- No!

05:13.646 --> 05:15.732
My god! Please!
I’m not a cake!

05:15.732 --> 05:18.317
- I’m not a cake!
- Grandpa! I’m a literal monster!

05:18.317 --> 05:20.361
And you’re blocking the TV. What’s up?

05:20.820 --> 05:24.741
- Open your mind!
- Hole shit!

05:24.741 --> 05:27.285
A kuato? How? How the fuck...

05:27.285 --> 05:30.496
Morty messed with my slider and
we fell in a pool and everyone booed!

05:30.496 --> 05:32.915
Thought the slider was gonna be
the whole thing this week.

05:32.915 --> 05:34.500
It’s not wow, you Grinch!

05:34.500 --> 05:37.045
Why do you care about high schoolers,
this is a kuato.

05:37.045 --> 05:38.129
From Total Recall?

05:38.129 --> 05:40.214
They’re basically the crown jewel
of psychic mutants.

05:40.214 --> 05:44.677
Everyone knows but me.
They fucking shamed me for it.

05:44.677 --> 05:47.180
Water must fried the gene sequencer.

05:47.180 --> 05:49.599
Your spines are braided?
Christ, what a mess.

05:49.599 --> 05:52.477
- You need to fix this, Grandpa!
- Okay, pay up.

05:52.852 --> 05:54.312
- What?
- Pay up, S-Slice.

05:54.312 --> 05:57.148
Thought you killed what you ate.
Chore wheel’s empty, if you work fast,

05:57.148 --> 06:00.359
- I’ll fix it in the morning.
- Open your mind!

06:00.359 --> 06:03.321
- See? Morty gets it.
- You’re worse than he is!

06:05.073 --> 06:07.283
Open your mind!

06:07.617 --> 06:08.659
God, shut up.

06:10.953 --> 06:13.456
Open your mind!

06:21.255 --> 06:24.634
- What the hell?
- Open your mind!

06:24.634 --> 06:28.137
God damn it Morty!
You’re even messing up my targeted ads.

06:31.140 --> 06:34.018
<i>I partied with other kuatos
and had the time of my life.</i>

06:34.018 --> 06:35.269
<i>Kuatos rule!</i>

06:37.188 --> 06:38.189
Whatever.

06:43.945 --> 06:45.655
You know what? Fuck this noise.

06:53.788 --> 06:56.999
- Nice Kuato.
- Open your mind!

06:56.999 --> 06:58.960
Preaching to the choir. Have fun.

07:04.465 --> 07:08.261
My glob! Your hair-kuato
combo is out of this world.

07:08.261 --> 07:12.723
I love your tumor-face guy.

07:12.723 --> 07:14.308
You’re hilarious.

07:17.937 --> 07:20.731
- What’ll it be?
- Open your mind.

07:20.731 --> 07:21.732
Coming right up.

07:29.115 --> 07:30.366
Sorry!

07:30.366 --> 07:33.244
I couldn’t help but notice your Kuato.
He’s huge!

07:33.244 --> 07:35.288
Thank you?

07:35.288 --> 07:38.082
I’m Kwyatt and this is Godiva.

07:38.082 --> 07:41.669
Summer and this little guy is Morty.

07:41.669 --> 07:45.131
Open your mind!

07:45.673 --> 07:47.300
I guess they all say that?

07:49.010 --> 07:50.678
You guys celebrating something?

07:50.678 --> 07:53.973
Being kuatos.
We’re kinda like VIPs here.

07:53.973 --> 07:56.517
Who’s your new friend, Kwyatt?
She’s cute.

07:56.517 --> 07:57.977
This is Summer and Morty.

07:57.977 --> 08:00.062
You guys should join us at our table!

08:02.982 --> 08:05.860
I mean, if you can handle
some rowdy kuats,

08:06.319 --> 08:07.320
you should come hang.

08:07.320 --> 08:09.363
Open your mind!

08:09.363 --> 08:11.157
Sounds like we’re down to clown.

08:17.496 --> 08:21.250
- You guys do this all the time?
- It’s a tight knit community.

08:21.250 --> 08:23.878
Feels like we’re part of the future,
you know?

08:23.878 --> 08:25.880
Being a mutant is rad.

08:25.880 --> 08:28.299
Open your mind!

08:28.299 --> 08:32.345
- What?
- Open your mind!

08:32.345 --> 08:33.596
Totally.

08:33.930 --> 08:36.349
I love being a kuato!

08:37.892 --> 08:39.060
Who’s that guy?

08:39.060 --> 08:41.938
Kenneth. He kinda pays for all this.
You wanna meet him?

08:41.938 --> 08:43.356
Obviously.

08:43.356 --> 08:46.567
Ken! This is summer and Morty.
They’re new to the scene,

08:46.567 --> 08:47.985
but they are the real deal!

08:47.985 --> 08:49.904
New friends! Champagne?

08:49.904 --> 08:51.989
So open-minded of you.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.282
We’re a rare breed!

08:53.282 --> 08:55.993
- Open your mind!
- What?

08:56.327 --> 08:58.955
Open your mind!

08:58.955 --> 09:02.291
Oh my God, your kuato is so funny.

09:02.291 --> 09:04.627
To kuatos! To the future!

09:26.274 --> 09:27.900
You wanna get outta here?

09:27.900 --> 09:29.277
Hell yeah I do.

09:31.070 --> 09:33.864
This is like, the best night
I’ve had in a while.

09:33.864 --> 09:35.199
Welcome to life as a kuato.

09:35.199 --> 09:36.659
Open your mind!

09:36.659 --> 09:38.369
Like, this whole time
I thought my brother

09:38.369 --> 09:41.205
was an anchor holding me back,
but he’s like a key,

09:41.205 --> 09:43.082
to something I never even imagined.

09:43.082 --> 09:45.167
Sounds like he opened your mind.

09:45.584 --> 09:46.502
So did you.

09:47.295 --> 09:50.589
- What’s wrong?
- I’m sorry.

09:50.589 --> 09:52.925
Wait! "I’m sorry" like,
you have a girlfriend,

09:52.925 --> 09:55.594
or "I’m sorry" like,
something much worse?

09:56.429 --> 09:57.722
<i>- What the fuck? Kwyatt?
- Open your mind!</i>

09:57.722 --> 09:59.598
Let me go! Let me go!

10:01.600 --> 10:03.561
- Hold her steady!
- Open your mind!

10:03.561 --> 10:05.730
- Hold him steady too!
- Open your mind!

10:07.481 --> 10:09.400
<i>Open your mind!</i>

10:13.738 --> 10:15.239
What? Where...

10:16.490 --> 10:17.408
Morty?

10:18.659 --> 10:19.994
Shit!

10:19.994 --> 10:22.121
What was the activation phrase?
Ponytail Assemble.

10:23.205 --> 10:24.498
Go go lock-picking ponytail.

10:25.666 --> 10:27.126
I don’t give my grandpa enough credit?

10:34.300 --> 10:37.595
The oven’s mostly for bodies,
but I make pizzas in here too.

10:41.140 --> 10:43.100
<i>Arrivadeadci,</i> bitch.

10:44.935 --> 10:48.356
Sorry! No time to save you more
than I just did, gotta find my brother!

10:53.652 --> 10:55.404
- Jesus! Shit!
- What the hell, Beth?

10:55.404 --> 10:57.948
- You’re paying for those!
- Just yell my name like normal!

10:57.948 --> 11:00.743
I did! Why do you think I risked
it with the tongs!

11:01.118 --> 11:04.914
I guess I did drink a lot last night.
Marathon of "Cake Or Fake",

11:04.914 --> 11:07.833
the sentient cakes,
they keep you guessing, you know?

11:08.167 --> 11:09.752
- Where are my kids?
- Merged?

11:10.503 --> 11:14.465
That doesn’t answer my question
and raises several others.

11:14.465 --> 11:16.634
Relax, sweetie!
Summer’s just doing chores.

11:16.634 --> 11:20.262
Which I will check on. By myself.
Without your tongs.

11:21.472 --> 11:22.390
Summer?

11:23.974 --> 11:24.892
Summer?

11:26.685 --> 11:30.606
Summer? God dammit!
Summer! You let them get hungry!

11:41.909 --> 11:44.954
- Wait, why is this in black and white?
- <i>For dramatic effect.</i>

11:44.954 --> 11:46.831
I didn’t design you for dramatic effect.

11:46.831 --> 11:48.791
<i>You made me sound like your dead wife.</i>

11:48.791 --> 11:50.126
Just color the fucking picture.

11:50.835 --> 11:52.962
We’re kinda like VIPs here.

11:52.962 --> 11:56.173
I mean, if you can handle some
rowdy kuats, you could join us?

11:56.173 --> 11:58.759
I bet you say that
to all the mutant girls.

11:59.969 --> 12:01.137
- He does.
- Holy shit!

12:01.137 --> 12:03.931
I’m just a pretty face!
I’m just a handsome guy!

12:03.931 --> 12:06.183
- Where’s Morty?
- He’s in a good place! He’s happy!

12:06.183 --> 12:07.184
It’s nice!

12:07.935 --> 12:10.104
He’s in a Taken house!

12:10.104 --> 12:11.939
We’re gonna put him
on the highest bidder!

12:11.939 --> 12:14.024
- Take me to him!
- They’ll kill me!

12:14.024 --> 12:15.818
Okay, alright. I’m sorry.
I’ll do it.

12:20.489 --> 12:23.075
So, he wasn’t into me?

12:23.826 --> 12:27.121
Open your... Open...

12:27.121 --> 12:28.998
<i>There he is. Man of the hour.</i>

12:29.790 --> 12:32.585
- How is our big boy?
<i>- Finally stable.</i>

12:32.585 --> 12:34.795
Should be ready for transplant
in a few hours.

12:34.795 --> 12:37.631
- Good.
- Open your mind!

12:37.965 --> 12:39.300
Why do I do it?

12:39.300 --> 12:42.136
Kuatos have always had
a revolutionary spirit.

12:42.553 --> 12:46.348
And there’s nothing more revolutionary
than me being rich.

12:46.682 --> 12:50.186
You think anyone in that VIP section
was BORN a kuato?

12:51.353 --> 12:52.771
You’re a rare breed, Morty.

12:53.105 --> 12:55.900
And we’re gonna put you
on someone who values that.

12:58.235 --> 13:00.029
- Where is she?
- She paid me, man!

13:00.029 --> 13:01.489
She used the taxi app!

13:01.822 --> 13:04.450
I make less than minimum wage
and I got five kids.

13:04.450 --> 13:08.496
Sorry, man. I guess I got really excited
to beat someone up for information.

13:09.788 --> 13:10.706
Where’d you take her?

13:12.791 --> 13:13.542
Where is she?

13:13.542 --> 13:17.922
She just ordered a drink! I spent a
long time mixing it she didn’t even tip!

13:17.922 --> 13:20.633
Shit, sorry! Wrong guy again.
Thought I’d be better at this.

13:20.633 --> 13:22.801
Whatever you say, man!
Just don’t hit me again!

13:22.801 --> 13:23.802
Who’d she leave with?

13:26.430 --> 13:28.682
- Where is she?
- I’ll never tell you!

13:28.682 --> 13:30.976
Okay! You actually know?

13:30.976 --> 13:32.937
Wait!
Isn’t that why you’re punching me?

13:32.937 --> 13:33.938
It is now!

13:34.480 --> 13:35.397
What did you do to her?

13:37.733 --> 13:40.319
- Where is she?
- Shit, man! Right there!

13:40.319 --> 13:41.320
Grandpa?

13:41.654 --> 13:43.447
Summer! Okay, awesome.

13:44.490 --> 13:46.200
Who’s this?
Hot guy who trafficked you?

13:46.200 --> 13:47.243
I’m Kwyatt.

13:47.243 --> 13:50.579
- I’m kind of on a roll, can I...
- Oh god, no, no, no!

13:50.579 --> 13:51.789
How’d you get here first?

13:51.789 --> 13:53.874
I guess even when I’m bad,
I’m still pretty good.

13:54.333 --> 13:56.168
So, what’s Morty saying to you?
Where is he?

13:56.168 --> 13:59.088
- What? How would I know?
- You didn’t form a psychic link?

13:59.088 --> 14:01.799
No! We didn’t form a psychic link,
what the fuck is that?

14:01.799 --> 14:05.594
That’s like the whole thing.
Crown jewel of psychic mutants, Summer.

14:05.594 --> 14:08.847
You used him to get with cool kids
but didn’t even activate your powers?

14:08.847 --> 14:10.891
It’s kind of a kuato’s whole deal.

14:10.891 --> 14:12.184
Sorry! Sorry!

14:12.184 --> 14:14.019
Alright, so how do I hear him?

14:14.019 --> 14:16.939
Open your mind, Summer? Christ.

14:21.235 --> 14:23.279
Hello? Morty?

14:23.946 --> 14:25.698
- Morty!
<i>- Summer?</i>

14:26.699 --> 14:28.450
<i>Summer! Is that you?</i>

14:28.450 --> 14:29.785
<i>Morty, I can hear you!</i>

14:29.785 --> 14:32.538
<i>Thank fucking Christ, you bitch!
I’ve been screaming for hours!</i>

14:32.538 --> 14:34.373
<i>Alright well!
I don’t have to hear you.</i>

14:34.373 --> 14:36.792
<i>Sorry!
And I’m sorry about the frolf party.</i>

14:36.792 --> 14:39.295
<i>I think they’re selling me, Summer!
Hurry!</i>

14:39.295 --> 14:40.879
They’re selling him, Grandpa!

14:40.879 --> 14:42.298
- Well, obviously.
- Well, obviously.

14:43.173 --> 14:46.635
You don’t have to do this!
What we had was real!

14:48.679 --> 14:51.056
- <i>Prepare to get opened.</i>
- Don’t shoot!

14:51.390 --> 14:54.101
<i>I didn’t tell them anything!
Except where and how to find you!</i>

14:54.101 --> 14:56.687
He’s outlived his usefulness.
Kill him.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.026
Oh shit, psychic warfare!

15:02.026 --> 15:03.819
- What?
- Hold on, Grandpa’s got this.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.030
<i>Oh shit! Run!</i>

15:07.406 --> 15:09.533
- Psychic grandpa.
- No, look!

15:10.034 --> 15:11.702
Fake temple
with a high pitch noise maker.

15:11.702 --> 15:13.203
<i>Run before these guys figure it out!</i>

15:13.203 --> 15:16.582
He’s a fake, you morons!
Like most psychics! Kill them!

15:17.916 --> 15:20.127
<i>- Summer!
- I’m coming, Morty! Where are you?</i>

15:20.127 --> 15:22.796
<i>I dunno! They’re moving me!
I’m on the move!</i>

15:23.339 --> 15:26.508
This next one comes with a hat...
Oh shit!

15:31.972 --> 15:34.475
That’s what frolf is about, bitch!

15:34.475 --> 15:37.144
Frisbee plus Golf. I get it now.

15:37.144 --> 15:38.479
<i>Summer, hurry!</i>

15:41.649 --> 15:44.360
Open your mind!

15:44.360 --> 15:46.862
Where do you think they got that one?
Whose chest is that big?

15:46.862 --> 15:48.030
We don’t have time for this.

15:48.030 --> 15:50.741
Why do you get to kick down
all the doors? I wanna kick one.

15:50.741 --> 15:53.243
Shit! It’s locked! My ankle!

15:53.243 --> 15:55.162
What is this, your first Taken?

15:55.871 --> 15:59.291
Fuck you, Summer! I rescue Morty
seven times per season!

15:59.291 --> 16:02.378
<i>- Summer! The boat, Summer!
- Morty! I see it! I see the boat!</i>

16:02.961 --> 16:04.338
Here, Summer! Check this out.

16:07.633 --> 16:09.677
- Check this out?
- Window jump.

16:09.677 --> 16:11.387
Try to say it’s my first Taken now.

16:13.055 --> 16:15.057
- It’s your first Taken.
- I’m getting my groove back!

16:15.057 --> 16:17.351
You heard him, boys.
Kill him before he gets his groove!

16:23.273 --> 16:24.191
Fuck!

16:24.191 --> 16:27.152
None of this would a happened
if you just unmerged us when I asked!

16:27.653 --> 16:29.238
Morty gets everything for free!

16:29.780 --> 16:33.409
Morty’s a dog! People have cats
because their affection is earned.

16:33.409 --> 16:36.078
I treat you like an equal
because I respect you,

16:36.078 --> 16:38.747
- you remind me of your grandmother.
- What?

16:39.206 --> 16:41.083
No! I said what...

16:41.083 --> 16:43.711
You’re getting choked.
Go go ponytail secret move!

16:44.378 --> 16:47.047
Oh my God! What? Hair, stop!

16:47.965 --> 16:49.967
- I need you to remove that.
- Ungrateful.

16:50.801 --> 16:51.927
How’s Morty?

16:51.927 --> 16:54.722
<i>Morty, you okay? Sorry!
I just killed a guy with my hair.</i>

16:54.722 --> 16:57.808
<i>No, I’m not okay!
I’m still on the boat! Hurry!</i>

16:58.392 --> 17:00.394
Open your mind!

17:00.394 --> 17:02.896
Sedate him.
We’re meeting his buyer in an hour.

17:07.025 --> 17:08.944
Open your mind!

17:08.944 --> 17:11.238
Easy there. It’ll all be over soon.

17:12.614 --> 17:15.117
Shit! Bite me twice, shame on me!

17:16.285 --> 17:19.705
Man inject me once.

17:25.586 --> 17:27.296
Sir! They’re inbound.
What should we do?

17:27.296 --> 17:28.589
Kill them, idiot!

17:31.175 --> 17:34.887
There are days, and there are days.

17:34.887 --> 17:37.765
Kenneth, you’re the crown jewel
of psychic assholes.

17:38.223 --> 17:41.101
Quite an entrance. Now for mine.

17:44.313 --> 17:45.981
That’s the reveal? You slide off?

17:45.981 --> 17:48.567
You think I’m done revealing?

17:50.444 --> 17:53.238
That’s right, it’s me!
A smaller Kuato.

17:53.655 --> 17:57.826
The mastermind behind it all.
I sold out my own kind,

17:57.826 --> 17:59.203
and I’d do it again!

17:59.203 --> 18:01.663
- Who could’ve seen that coming.
- I mean, he can talk.

18:02.080 --> 18:03.957
- That’s kinda surprising.
- Yes.

18:03.957 --> 18:07.002
Everyone always assumed
that charming Kenneth was the brains.

18:07.336 --> 18:10.964
Or perhaps his Kuato.
But I was in control!

18:12.382 --> 18:14.343
- Morty!
- Damn Morty, big air!

18:16.595 --> 18:17.638
Stop it!

18:23.227 --> 18:25.729
- Open your mind.
- You wanna die?

18:31.485 --> 18:32.903
You little shit!

18:33.904 --> 18:36.865
- He’s got a knife!
- Not just any knife.

18:38.283 --> 18:39.201
Kuato knife!

18:40.410 --> 18:41.745
Stop! That’s mine!

18:42.746 --> 18:43.664
Shit! Fuck!

18:44.748 --> 18:46.125
Shit! It has missiles!

18:48.001 --> 18:49.670
You think this is a joke?

18:54.675 --> 18:58.512
You’re about to die.
So I’ll let you in on my true secret.

19:00.305 --> 19:04.434
Those last three guys were chumps.
I’m the real top dawg.

19:04.434 --> 19:07.646
Shit, is that three or four?
I’ve lost count.

19:07.646 --> 19:11.191
- But wait, if you’re dazzled now.
- Okay!

19:11.191 --> 19:12.276
I see where this is going.

19:15.070 --> 19:15.988
No! No!

19:19.199 --> 19:21.869
What? No! No!
No!

19:26.582 --> 19:29.960
Man, kind of a shame.
That spider thing was pretty cool.

19:29.960 --> 19:32.129
<i>- I wanted it.</i>
- Morty says he wanted it.

19:32.129 --> 19:33.630
Okay! Here.

19:40.804 --> 19:43.182
- You gotta jiggle it more.
- Obviously I’m jiggling it, Summer!

19:43.182 --> 19:45.809
<i>- Well, not hard enough.</i>
- Morty says "Not hard enough".

19:45.809 --> 19:47.811
I must have it set up
for motion smoothing.

19:47.811 --> 19:49.354
I gotta upgrade the polling rate.

19:54.401 --> 19:57.613
Jesus, what are you, a lifeguard?
Just jiggle it!

19:57.613 --> 19:59.114
I’m alive! I’m alive!

19:59.615 --> 20:04.411
No, wait!
I have so much more to reveal! No!

20:05.704 --> 20:07.039
There we go.

20:10.792 --> 20:12.252
<i>This is great.</i>

20:12.586 --> 20:13.921
Morty, looking good.

20:13.921 --> 20:15.964
Bro you’re actually like a fucking boss.

20:16.381 --> 20:17.549
<i>Wait, can that thing jump?</i>

20:18.508 --> 20:20.052
<i>Oh my god, bro.</i>

20:20.427 --> 20:23.138
- Frolf!
- Frolf!

20:23.472 --> 20:28.101
- Frolf!
- Frolf!

20:32.773 --> 20:35.442
<i>And the Harry Herpsons win!</i>

20:35.442 --> 20:37.444
Morty! That’s a par!

20:40.072 --> 20:42.407
Open your mind!

20:47.287 --> 20:50.040
Did you see that par?
Morty’s killer out there.

20:50.040 --> 20:53.085
- He’s not even using his missiles.
- Speaking of...

20:53.502 --> 20:55.629
I kinda need a new girl
to hook up with on Tuesdays?

20:56.964 --> 20:59.424
- Pass.
- You wanna get out of here?

20:59.424 --> 21:00.259
Totes.

21:00.259 --> 21:02.844
Summer saved me from being
trafficked and burned alive.

21:02.844 --> 21:03.845
It’s like whatever.

21:05.430 --> 21:09.101
Damn, Summer Smith.
There is no end to your complexity.

21:11.144 --> 21:13.021
There’s the missiles.

21:13.021 --> 21:16.149
Open your mind!

21:48.348 --> 21:51.601
Yes, well, my new kuato
was named Morty,

21:51.601 --> 21:53.812
but I’m going to call him Sixty nine.

21:56.189 --> 21:58.859
Kenneth’s running a little late
with the package, no?

21:58.859 --> 22:00.277
Oh, he’ll show.

22:00.277 --> 22:04.281
Do you know how much I paid?
Sixty nine million flurbo.

22:06.199 --> 22:09.369
I had seventy of course,
but, sixty-nine...

22:11.830 --> 22:14.041
I have sixty-nine credit cards.

22:16.126 --> 22:18.378
My wife wanted to have sex,
but I said no,

22:18.378 --> 22:20.172
not unless we sixty-nine.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.552
- TMI, Michael.
- You have a wife?
