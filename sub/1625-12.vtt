09:36.875 --> 09:39.208
I didn't do it.
It's so not hot.

09:39.311 --> 09:40.578
He's my boyfriend.
I mean,

09:40.579 --> 09:42.347
it's not like borrowing money
from family.

09:42.348 --> 09:44.716
You don't sleep
with your family.

09:44.717 --> 09:48.050
Not all families
are the same, Caroline.

09:48.554 --> 09:51.387
Besides, we're fine.
The universe will provide.

09:51.390 --> 09:53.358
Well, the universe
better provide in,

09:53.359 --> 09:54.893
like, a second, 'cause look,
there's the landlord.

09:54.894 --> 09:56.828
He just went
into that Moroccan place.

09:56.829 --> 09:57.829
What are we
gonna do?

09:57.830 --> 09:58.963
- Hide!
- What?

09:58.964 --> 10:00.899
Well, I should go.

10:00.900 --> 10:02.400
It's too late for that!

10:02.401 --> 10:03.535
Lock the door, hit the lights,

10:03.536 --> 10:05.804
and crawl over here,
and stay low!

10:05.805 --> 10:08.073
Stay down
till we're out of sight.

10:08.074 --> 10:09.074
Ow!

10:09.075 --> 10:12.408
Ow. Ow, it hurts!

10:12.445 --> 10:14.379
Oh, please.
Like this is the first time

10:14.380 --> 10:16.815
you've been on your knees
in the bathroom.

10:16.816 --> 10:19.017
Caroline, you don't have to
stay on the ground anymore.

10:19.018 --> 10:21.586
I feel like
this is where I belong now.

10:22.587 --> 10:24.489
[Keys jangling]
Yo, Baker girls.

10:24.490 --> 10:25.824
Max, he's in the shop.

10:25.825 --> 10:27.992
- Okay, go, out the window.
- Really?

10:27.993 --> 10:29.728
If he can't see us,
he can't evict us.

10:29.729 --> 10:32.831
Go.

10:32.832 --> 10:35.467
It's a little high.
Are you sure?

10:35.468 --> 10:38.636
You've heard "When God closes
a door, he opens a window"?

10:38.637 --> 10:39.904
He's running
from his landlord.

10:39.905 --> 10:41.107
Go.

10:42.108 --> 10:44.976
Okay, here goes.
I love you, Max.

10:48.114 --> 10:49.748
What about me?
What should I do?

10:49.749 --> 10:52.517
Put the money for those
cupcakes on the counter.

10:57.089 --> 10:58.356
Who are you?

10:58.357 --> 10:59.640
Uh...

10:59.997 --> 11:01.690
<i>No hablo ingles?</i>

11:05.643 --> 11:06.976
All right, all right,
good news.

11:06.977 --> 11:09.612
I just found $3
in my pocket.

11:09.613 --> 11:11.281
Oh, and a peanut M&M,

11:11.282 --> 11:13.449
so we don't have to
spend money on dinner.

11:13.450 --> 11:15.451
Caroline,
why are you putting it off?

11:15.452 --> 11:16.853
You know
what you have to do.

11:16.854 --> 11:19.122
Go over to the couch and
put your hands in that crack.

11:19.123 --> 11:21.958
It's every poor girl's
rite of passage.

11:23.694 --> 11:24.961
Oh!

11:24.962 --> 11:25.962
What?

11:25.963 --> 11:28.232
I think something
just licked me.

11:29.993 --> 11:32.068
I'll just check our purses.
Here's yours.

11:32.069 --> 11:33.336
Uh, no, no, no.
I already checked that.

11:33.337 --> 11:34.470
There's nothing
in mine...

11:34.471 --> 11:36.005
Except that baggie of pot

11:36.006 --> 11:38.541
that Keefer gave me
as a Christmas present.

11:38.542 --> 11:40.343
Max, this is not
a Christmas present.

11:40.344 --> 11:43.112
This is a giant, illegal,
fat sack of weed.

11:43.113 --> 11:45.815
Yeah,
with a Rudolph sticker,

11:45.816 --> 11:47.750
which makes it
a Christmas present.

11:47.751 --> 11:50.653
See?
His nose and his eyes are red.

11:51.654 --> 11:53.987
I want this out of my sight.
You gotta get rid of it.

11:54.124 --> 11:55.692
[Scoffs]
Well, it's gonna take me

11:55.693 --> 11:58.227
at least 45 minutes
to smoke all that.

11:58.228 --> 11:59.729
Max, I'm serious,

11:59.730 --> 12:01.931
I'm not comfortable
with that fat sack of weed.

12:01.932 --> 12:04.601
Stop saying
"fat sack of weed."

12:04.602 --> 12:07.170
You're like someone's dad
overusing the word "awesome."

12:08.171 --> 12:09.672
I'll just
put it up here,

12:09.673 --> 12:13.006
next to the half a Vicodin
I was saving for new year's.

12:14.044 --> 12:15.044
[Screams]

12:15.045 --> 12:16.946
Oh, no!
The pot!

12:16.947 --> 12:18.314
The pot is in the pot!

12:18.315 --> 12:20.850
It's in the butter
I was using to make cupcakes.

12:20.851 --> 12:21.918
Maybe this is
the universe's way

12:21.919 --> 12:23.920
of telling you
to stop doing drugs.

12:23.921 --> 12:27.254
Or is it telling us
to sell them?

12:29.826 --> 12:32.328
Max, we are
not that desperate.

12:32.329 --> 12:33.763
We're not making
pot cupcakes.

12:33.764 --> 12:35.865
I'd rather just see
what the holidays bring.

12:35.866 --> 12:38.234
Well, this isn't Bethlehem,
it's Brooklyn.

12:38.235 --> 12:40.003
There's no frankincense
and myrrh,

12:40.004 --> 12:42.672
there's only frankenberry
and "myrrh-ajuana."

12:50.788 --> 12:53.221
These turned out great!
Good idea, universe.

12:53.422 --> 12:56.491
I knew you smoked weed.

12:56.492 --> 12:58.894
Oh, my God.
I can't believe the smell.

12:58.895 --> 13:02.063
It's like a skunk
skunked a skunk.

13:02.064 --> 13:04.232
I know.
It's like a port-a-potty

13:04.233 --> 13:06.368
on the last day
of Coachella.

13:07.119 --> 13:08.970
Oh, no,
Chestnut's smelling this.

13:08.971 --> 13:11.173
I got my horse stoned.

13:11.174 --> 13:12.741
Oh, relax.

13:12.742 --> 13:15.544
He's just trying
to fit in at school.

13:16.045 --> 13:17.679
Do you think
the neighbors can smell it?

13:17.680 --> 13:19.414
Do you think
they're gonna call the cops?

13:19.415 --> 13:21.750
Chill out!
How can someone be this paranoid

13:21.751 --> 13:23.419
before they're high?

13:24.120 --> 13:25.587
Here, taste this.

13:25.588 --> 13:26.955
Max, I don't do pot.

13:26.956 --> 13:28.557
I tried it a couple times
in college.

13:28.558 --> 13:30.358
It totally changed
my personality.

13:30.359 --> 13:33.692
Then <i>please</i>
have some pot right now.

13:34.396 --> 13:35.864
Come on,
it's business.

13:35.865 --> 13:37.566
I need you to taste it
and tell me how it is,

13:37.567 --> 13:39.134
'cause I can't tell.
At this point,

13:39.135 --> 13:41.503
everything I put in my mouth
tastes like pot.

13:44.473 --> 13:46.306
Hey, it's pretty good.

13:47.376 --> 13:50.709
In fact,
it's kind of delicious.

13:50.746 --> 13:52.881
We should charge
15 apiece for these.

13:52.882 --> 13:55.450
That's $540.
That's our rent.

13:55.451 --> 13:57.052
A few more bites
of that cupcake,

13:57.053 --> 13:59.387
and that math would've
taken two hours longer.

13:59.388 --> 14:00.755
[Pounding at the door]

14:00.756 --> 14:02.624
Oh, my God!
It's the cops!

14:02.625 --> 14:04.559
It's probably
that same SWAT team!

14:04.560 --> 14:06.394
I told you not to get involved
with drugs!

14:06.395 --> 14:08.396
I told you!

14:08.397 --> 14:11.730
Shut it, Caroline!
Shut it!

14:11.934 --> 14:13.969
Relax, it's Sophie.

14:13.970 --> 14:17.303
Hi, girls.
I got my period.

14:18.507 --> 14:20.242
Yeah, I got killer cramps.

14:20.243 --> 14:23.411
It's like I got a tractor
in my uterus.

14:23.412 --> 14:25.380
Sophie, we're sorry
you're not feeling well.

14:25.381 --> 14:26.982
Yeah, you know,
it's times like these

14:26.983 --> 14:28.783
I think God's a bitch.

14:28.784 --> 14:30.752
Ugh!

14:30.753 --> 14:34.086
Wait a minute,
wait a minute.

14:34.523 --> 14:37.659
What's that smell?

14:37.660 --> 14:38.994
Nothing.
It's nothing.

14:38.995 --> 14:41.463
Maui wowie!

14:41.464 --> 14:44.797
Oh, you girls
have been holding out on me!

14:45.835 --> 14:49.168
Oh!
All right! Okay!

14:49.272 --> 14:52.440
This is what
I'm talking about!

14:52.441 --> 14:55.410
Oh, my God,
good-bye, killer cramps!

14:55.411 --> 14:57.579
Hello, pot party!

14:57.580 --> 15:00.913
I am picking up
what you are laying down.

15:01.083 --> 15:03.151
Mmm!

15:04.553 --> 15:07.886
I think we found
our new product spokesperson.

15:08.357 --> 15:11.690
[Humming]

15:11.861 --> 15:13.028
Here it is.

15:13.029 --> 15:14.529
I've been here once before
with Keefer.

15:14.530 --> 15:16.865
Judah's a really chill guy,
kind of a tech genius.

15:16.866 --> 15:18.266
Think we can probably
sell them all here.

15:18.997 --> 15:19.768
Are you okay?

15:19.769 --> 15:22.037
You haven't spoken
the entire way over here,

15:22.038 --> 15:23.371
which is either
a side effect of the pot,

15:23.372 --> 15:25.473
or my early
Christmas present.

15:25.474 --> 15:27.575
No, I'm fine.
I feel exactly the same.

15:27.576 --> 15:29.277
It hasn't changed me
at all.

15:29.278 --> 15:30.745
Ooh!
Careful with the box,

15:30.746 --> 15:32.080
'cause you're smearing
the cupcakes.

15:32.081 --> 15:34.916
Oh, what does it matter?
We're all gonna die.

15:35.217 --> 15:37.953
Is this that other personality
you were telling me about?

15:37.954 --> 15:40.021
No, it's still me.
Not that I matter.

15:40.022 --> 15:42.290
None of us do.
We're all gonna die.

15:42.691 --> 15:44.559
Oh, crap.

15:44.560 --> 15:45.827
Hey, Max!

15:45.828 --> 15:47.295
I was so happy
that you called.

15:47.296 --> 15:49.798
And we're so happy
you're addicted to marijuana.

15:50.299 --> 15:51.900
You know it always
leads to heroin--

15:51.901 --> 15:53.134
Which leads to death.
We get it.

15:53.135 --> 15:56.171
You're the one
not-fun stoner.

15:56.172 --> 15:58.473
Hey, guys, the chicks
are here with the edibles.

15:58.474 --> 15:59.474
All: Edibles!
- We're having a little bit

15:59.475 --> 16:00.675
of a celebration.

16:00.676 --> 16:02.510
Okay, so cupcakes.

16:02.511 --> 16:04.479
They're 15 apiece,
good quality.

16:04.480 --> 16:06.748
And guys, we have to sell
all of them, or tomorrow,

16:06.749 --> 16:09.351
we'll be eating
out of a Dumpster.

16:09.352 --> 16:11.720
Does anyone
have any uppers?

16:11.721 --> 16:15.054
I have to sit down.
I mean, life. Ugh!

16:15.091 --> 16:17.392
I'm so tired of pretending
it's all gonna be okay.

16:17.393 --> 16:19.127
It's not.

16:19.128 --> 16:20.862
You should get that mole
checked out.

16:20.863 --> 16:24.196
I don't feel good
about it.

16:24.266 --> 16:25.900
Dude, this chick
is freaking me out.

16:25.901 --> 16:28.536
Just take it easy, Dave.
We'll just get some food in her.

16:28.537 --> 16:30.105
I got a buddy on the way
with pizza.

16:30.106 --> 16:31.573
Guys,
I'm sorry about her.

16:31.574 --> 16:33.475
It's like bringing your mother
to a strip club.

16:33.476 --> 16:35.543
Not for me. That'd be like
taking my mom to work.

16:35.544 --> 16:36.978
[Laughs]

16:36.979 --> 16:39.047
Strippers,
how about their lives?

16:39.048 --> 16:40.448
They got no way out.

16:40.449 --> 16:42.083
Can I talk to you,
before you start performing

16:42.084 --> 16:45.253
an acoustic ballad
about strippers with moles?

16:47.923 --> 16:50.725
What's the point, Max?

16:50.726 --> 16:53.361
Go, if you're gonna hit me,
hit me.

16:53.362 --> 16:54.829
What is happening
with you?

16:54.830 --> 16:58.163
I didn't even know
blonde people could be sad.

16:58.167 --> 16:59.634
Max, I have to tell you
something.

16:59.635 --> 17:01.870
[Whispering] Come here.
It's a secret. Come here.

17:01.871 --> 17:05.040
We're not gonna make it.

17:05.040 --> 17:07.108
But you're the one
who's always telling me

17:07.108 --> 17:08.343
everything's gonna be fine.

17:08.344 --> 17:11.246
Yeah, I was lying.

17:11.247 --> 17:14.015
[Knocking at the door]

17:14.016 --> 17:15.717
Where's the weed,
homeslizzy?

17:15.718 --> 17:17.819
[Chuckles]
Perfect timing, Andy.

17:17.819 --> 17:20.722
These are the girls
who are selling edibles.

17:20.723 --> 17:22.957
No, that's my girlfriend,
Caroline.

17:23.258 --> 17:25.859
That sucks for you, dude.

17:27.997 --> 17:29.932
What are you doing here?

17:34.837 --> 17:37.770
She is really
getting the hang of that.

17:38.307 --> 17:40.775
And around 4:00 a.m.,
you finally called me

17:40.776 --> 17:43.778
from an IHOP in Greenpoint,
and I came and picked you up.

17:43.779 --> 17:45.513
You were covered in syrup,
yelling,

17:45.514 --> 17:48.583
"the Mayans were right!
The Mayans were right!"

17:50.852 --> 17:52.187
There's my little stoner.

17:52.188 --> 17:55.521
Andy, I don't get stoned.
It was just last night.

17:55.758 --> 17:57.192
I know.
You told me all about it

17:57.193 --> 17:58.760
when you called
at 4:00 a.m.

17:59.361 --> 18:02.094
Sorry,
and I'm mortified to ask,

18:02.098 --> 18:03.998
but did you and I
have phone sex?

18:03.999 --> 18:07.332
That was you and me.

18:07.703 --> 18:09.572
Stoned Caroline's got game.

18:11.073 --> 18:12.974
Hey, Max told me
about the rent.

18:12.975 --> 18:14.542
Why didn't you tell me
you guys needed help?

18:15.043 --> 18:16.678
I guess I just
didn't want to have to admit

18:16.679 --> 18:19.013
to you or to myself
that we're in real trouble.

18:19.014 --> 18:22.347
Plus, being a charity instead
of a girlfriend is so not hot.

18:22.418 --> 18:25.587
Uh, there is nothing
you can do that is not hot.

18:25.588 --> 18:27.188
Oh, then whatever you do,
do not look at the video

18:27.189 --> 18:29.657
Max has of me, rolling around
in the IHOP parking lot,

18:29.658 --> 18:32.093
covered in syrup.
[Laughs]

18:32.694 --> 18:34.095
I want you to have this.

18:34.096 --> 18:37.132
Cash it, don't cash it.
Do whatever you want,

18:37.133 --> 18:39.400
but just know that my success
doesn't mean anything

18:39.401 --> 18:41.870
if I can't
share it with you.

18:41.871 --> 18:43.571
Thank you.

18:43.572 --> 18:46.905
Andy, that is so amazing,
and I really appreciate it,

18:47.009 --> 18:48.643
but I can't take it.

18:48.644 --> 18:50.311
Well, it's a win-win.

18:50.312 --> 18:52.747
At least it got your hand
in my pants.

18:52.748 --> 18:55.850
And remember,
if you ever need it, it's there.

18:55.851 --> 18:58.286
I'm talking about my penis.
[Laughs]

19:04.659 --> 19:06.992
Andy offered to pay our rent,
but I said no.

19:07.329 --> 19:10.662
That is the whitest thing
I've ever heard.

19:11.000 --> 19:12.800
It was really sweet
of him,

19:12.801 --> 19:15.637
but I didn't want to take money
from a man I'm sleeping with.

19:15.638 --> 19:17.505
Wait, are you telling me
there are women

19:17.506 --> 19:20.839
who don't take money
from men they're sleeping with?

19:21.544 --> 19:23.311
What's gonna happen, Max?

19:23.312 --> 19:25.013
I don't know.

19:25.014 --> 19:28.347
But we do have
Christmas decorations,

19:28.617 --> 19:29.951
so let's put them up.

19:29.952 --> 19:31.019
Wait a minute.

19:31.020 --> 19:32.520
You're the one
pushing Christmas?

19:32.521 --> 19:34.189
Who are you, me?

19:34.190 --> 19:37.058
No, I still have
my dignity.

19:37.459 --> 19:40.892
Speaking of Christmas,
here are the 21/2 wise men.

19:42.998 --> 19:45.767
- What's up?
- Caroline called me last night.

19:45.768 --> 19:47.802
Told me that you two
couldn't pay your rent,

19:47.803 --> 19:49.537
that you were losing the shop.

19:49.538 --> 19:52.871
That girl can talk.

19:54.143 --> 19:56.811
She called me too, and said
you didn't have your rent,

19:56.812 --> 19:59.480
and also that, for sure,
the rising waters of the ocean

19:59.481 --> 20:02.814
will swallow us
and kill us all.

20:04.286 --> 20:07.522
So we put together
what we had, and... here.

20:07.523 --> 20:09.190
Consider it
an early Christmas gift

20:09.191 --> 20:10.391
from all three of us...

20:10.392 --> 20:13.161
Even though I gave 350,
Earl gave 100,

20:13.162 --> 20:16.164
and he gave 50.

20:16.865 --> 20:18.700
Thank you,
but we can't take it.

20:18.701 --> 20:22.034
Yes, you can.
We're family.

20:22.871 --> 20:24.939
500 whole dollars?

20:24.940 --> 20:26.841
[Sobbing]
Thank you, guys.

20:26.842 --> 20:29.844
<i>[Christmas Time is Here</i>
by Vince Guaraldi]

20:29.845 --> 20:33.178
And we have
something special for you.

20:37.987 --> 20:39.854
What makes it special?

20:39.855 --> 20:43.188
The love
she puts into 'em, man.

20:48.030 --> 20:51.363
You can smell the love
all around her.

20:52.301 --> 20:54.369
Mmm.

20:55.571 --> 20:58.439
You know, Max,
I think we're gonna make it.

20:58.440 --> 21:00.575
I like
not-stoned Caroline.

21:00.576 --> 21:02.076
We're gonna keep you
off the drugs.

21:02.077 --> 21:03.978
You mean
because I'm more positive?

21:03.979 --> 21:05.747
No, 'cause we may
have to sell your urine

21:05.748 --> 21:08.750
for next month's rent, and
I'm gonna need that pee clean.

21:08.751 --> 21:12.084
[Laughter]

21:14.957 --> 21:17.425
- Mmm, so good.
- [Laughs]
