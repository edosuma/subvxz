you two would agree

10:25.125 --> 10:26.257
- Well, that's not fair.

10:26.393 --> 10:27.926
- Why? Because we're girls,
we're gonna lose?

10:28.061 --> 10:29.661
- Well, because you've never
done it before.

10:29.796 --> 10:30.995
And we've done it a lot.

10:30.998 --> 10:32.397
And our team would be kind
of stacked.

10:32.532 --> 10:34.865
- Ah, we'll see about that.

10:34.901 --> 10:37.334
- Wow, you're very confident,
young lady.

10:37.371 --> 10:39.804
Okay, you wanna make
a little side bet?

10:39.806 --> 10:41.806
- Dad...
- Hey.

10:41.842 --> 10:44.142
Dinner. Loser buys.

10:44.277 --> 10:46.477
- Okay, you're on.
- Yeah, no Maggie's, either.

10:46.513 --> 10:48.079
I'm talking steak and lobster.

10:48.115 --> 10:49.814
- Yeah, you better
start saving.

10:49.816 --> 10:52.283
(Both laugh)
- Oh boy.

10:54.988 --> 10:56.021
- Ketchup?

10:56.156 --> 10:57.889
- Uh, no thanks,
it's loaded with sugar.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.357
- Exactly. Bring it on.

10:59.359 --> 11:01.426
- Hey, did you talk to your mom
in the last couple of days?

11:01.495 --> 11:03.260
- Yeah I did, why?

11:03.296 --> 11:05.497
- Well, she's won't answer
my calls.

11:05.499 --> 11:07.098
I mean, I want to look for
a new assistant manager,

11:07.233 --> 11:09.100
but I can't until she signs
off on it.

11:09.235 --> 11:10.368
- She's super busy.

11:10.503 --> 11:13.037
She probably just hasn't had
time to think about it.

11:13.040 --> 11:14.305
- Right.

11:14.374 --> 11:16.307
- Um, I'm-I'll be right back.

11:16.309 --> 11:18.309
- Yeah.

11:18.378 --> 11:20.145
(Groans)

11:21.415 --> 11:23.848
Maybe I just need to make
an executive decision.

11:23.983 --> 11:26.183
Just put an ad out.

11:26.219 --> 11:28.319
My ship, my rules.

11:28.388 --> 11:31.055
- Or maybe you should hold off.
- Yeah, you're right,

11:31.058 --> 11:32.857
I should get Lou to sign off
on it first.

11:32.992 --> 11:34.391
- No, no, it's just...

11:34.428 --> 11:37.128
maybe I could be your
assistant manager.

11:37.263 --> 11:39.130
- Really? You want that job?

11:39.265 --> 11:40.965
That's a lot of hours.

11:41.101 --> 11:42.833
I mean, what about
your rodeo schedule?

11:42.869 --> 11:44.535
- I'm sure I could
figure it out.

11:44.604 --> 11:46.404

11:46.539 --> 11:48.540

11:48.675 --> 11:50.608
I will uh, I'll think about it.

11:54.481 --> 11:57.949

12:11.865 --> 12:14.465
Hold up a sec, I wanna talk
to you about something.

12:14.468 --> 12:16.835
So what do you think
about taking on the guys

12:16.970 --> 12:18.903
in a little team penning?

12:19.038 --> 12:22.240
Us three, against my Dad,
Grampa, and Caleb.

12:22.242 --> 12:24.175
- But aren't they all
really good at it?

12:24.310 --> 12:26.444
- Yeah, so? Maybe we are, too.

12:26.513 --> 12:28.579
I think it would be a lot
of fun, and besides,

12:28.615 --> 12:31.148
think of the bragging rights
if we actually win.

12:31.150 --> 12:32.784
- I mean, I'm in if you are.

12:32.919 --> 12:36.120
Imagine if we actually beat Tim.

12:36.189 --> 12:37.922
- All right, I guess I could
give it a try.

12:37.991 --> 12:40.191
- Okay great, well,
let's start practicing,

12:40.326 --> 12:42.260
I'll teach you the basics.

12:47.400 --> 12:49.200

12:49.335 --> 12:52.236
- Okay, each team
goes separately.

12:52.272 --> 12:53.971
- So we're against the clock?

12:54.007 --> 12:56.006
- Yeah, exactly.
You wanna ride in,

12:56.042 --> 12:59.410
and you have to pick three
of the same numbered cattle

12:59.546 --> 13:01.079
and bring them into the pen.

13:01.214 --> 13:03.014
Okay? So why don't you
try first?

13:03.016 --> 13:06.284
Just go in, and, and cut out
uh, number six.

13:06.353 --> 13:08.686
All right? Just bring it
away from the herd.

13:08.688 --> 13:10.088
(Cows moo)

13:10.223 --> 13:11.890
- Like this?

13:11.892 --> 13:14.659
- Yeah, don't be shy.
Get in there.

13:16.029 --> 13:17.428
Follow that six.

13:17.564 --> 13:20.298
<i> That's it, there you go!</i>

13:20.433 --> 13:22.400
There, and see how she's
working that cow

13:22.469 --> 13:25.002
so he stays away from the herd?

13:25.004 --> 13:26.971
- I got her.

13:27.106 --> 13:28.973
- Good boy, Trouble.

- Look, I got it!

13:47.194 --> 13:48.993
- Jade, easy, easy, we don't
need to split the herd,

13:49.128 --> 13:51.996
just go in there nice
and quiet.

13:51.998 --> 13:54.299
- Okay, okay!

13:55.402 --> 13:57.168

- Now, before you give me
any more guff

14:19.993 --> 14:22.360
about another present,
it goes with the horse, so.

14:22.362 --> 14:24.629
- Okay, well, I think Lyndy's
pretty lucky to have

14:24.631 --> 14:27.098
a god papa like you.

14:27.167 --> 14:28.299
- I was actually hoping to talk

14:28.335 --> 14:29.968
to you about the penning
competition, if...

14:29.970 --> 14:32.103
- Yeah, come on in, do you want
a drink, or something?

14:32.238 --> 14:34.172

14:34.307 --> 14:36.473
(Sighs) You put me on Team Tim.

14:36.509 --> 14:39.176
- Well, my Dad is convinced
that you guys have this thing

14:39.212 --> 14:41.179
in the bag, so you should
be happy.

14:41.314 --> 14:44.181
- (Sighs) Well, whatever.
Tim's gonna be Tim.

14:44.251 --> 14:46.984
I was actually hoping to talk
to you about Rusty.

14:47.020 --> 14:48.986
- I think he's gonna be
a good horse for this.

14:49.122 --> 14:51.055
- You'd think so, but lately
he's been distracted,

14:51.190 --> 14:53.258
and just not able to focus.

14:53.393 --> 14:55.259
I was just hoping if you have
some free time today,

14:55.262 --> 14:56.461
you could take a look at him?

14:56.463 --> 14:58.195
I know we're in competition,
but...

14:58.197 --> 14:59.330
- No, I'll take a look at him.

we kick your butt.

I guess I sound like my Dad,
don't I?

15:04.604 --> 15:06.704
- No, not even close,
you'd have to get way up

15:06.740 --> 15:09.107
to this level of crazy
to sound like Tim.

15:10.176 --> 15:12.276
- Crazy?

15:12.279 --> 15:14.311
Like a fox, maybe.

15:14.347 --> 15:17.147
I got a great idea.
- And I don't wanna hear it.

15:17.183 --> 15:18.783
So I'll be back.

15:20.754 --> 15:23.220
- Okay, I think we could turn
this team penning thing

15:23.290 --> 15:24.422
into quite an event.

15:24.424 --> 15:26.490
- This is a family thing.
- Exactly.

15:26.492 --> 15:30.428
I think we should do a family
and friends fun day,

15:30.430 --> 15:31.696
right here at Heartland.

15:31.765 --> 15:33.097
And we do all kinds of events.

15:33.232 --> 15:36.501
You know, stuff for the kids,
roping, barrel racing,

15:36.636 --> 15:38.435
hide pulling.
- Uh huh?

15:38.471 --> 15:40.071
- You know, we'll get people
excited about this.

15:40.206 --> 15:41.706
Word gets out,
we'll sell tickets.

15:41.841 --> 15:43.574
- Tickets?
- And the winner...

15:43.643 --> 15:46.310
gets to donate the money
to the charity of their choice.

15:46.379 --> 15:48.713
So say, after my health scare
last year,

15:48.715 --> 15:51.849
the money would go
to the Hudson Cancer Society.

15:51.851 --> 15:53.117
What about you?

15:53.186 --> 15:55.252
- I have not agreed
to do this yet.

15:55.254 --> 15:57.855
- Okay, how about a horse
rescue shelter?

15:57.857 --> 16:00.791
Well, unless you're afraid
of disappointing them.

16:00.860 --> 16:02.660
- Fine, let's do it.

16:02.729 --> 16:04.261
That way the whole town
can watch me wipe

16:04.297 --> 16:07.732
that smug look off your face.
- Oh, delusionally confident.

16:07.801 --> 16:09.734
I like that.

16:09.803 --> 16:11.602

there's gonna be a crowd

16:25.418 --> 16:27.551
watching us do penning.
- Yeah, he goaded Amy into it.

16:27.687 --> 16:29.453
- Well, this is getting
out of control.

16:29.522 --> 16:31.155
- Look it's just a few
people from town.

16:31.290 --> 16:32.689
- Yeah, but I didn't sign up
for this.

16:32.726 --> 16:34.124
- If I'm doing this,
so are you.

16:34.160 --> 16:36.127
You can't back out now.
- Yeah, but I'm not good at it.

16:36.196 --> 16:38.363
I-I don't wanna embarrass
myself!

16:38.498 --> 16:41.231

practice, okay? Come on.

16:41.267 --> 16:43.567

16:43.603 --> 16:46.237

this another go?

16:46.306 --> 16:49.306
- Yeah, what number?

gonna take a breather,
and we'll give it another try.

17:07.126 --> 17:09.994

This was a stupid idea!

in the woods gonna do?

17:18.705 --> 17:20.404
- Well, taking him in
and around the trees

17:20.440 --> 17:22.673
will force him to concentrate.
- Good luck with that.

17:22.742 --> 17:24.809

Either way, sure.

where this is going.

a while to dig a new hole

19:42.882 --> 19:45.283
for the outhouse.

19:45.285 --> 19:47.985

- I know.

19:47.987 --> 19:49.620
Gruelling work.

19:49.656 --> 19:51.555
- And we could handle it
just fine,

19:51.558 --> 19:52.957
but we're not gonna need to,

19:52.959 --> 19:55.726

digging that hole.

as assistant manager,

20:11.377 --> 20:13.844
I am going to need you to
do some of the admin stuff.

scheduling.

I'm sorry.

talk about this later.

rodeo's been a blast,

but maybe it's time I grow up
and get a real job.

20:52.551 --> 20:53.951
Assistant manager's gonna look
way better on my resume

29:51.524 --> 29:53.223
- Doctors didn't have
much insight

29:53.259 --> 29:55.425
into that sort of thing
back then,

29:55.494 --> 29:57.027
or much of a bedside manner.

29:57.162 --> 30:00.096
They flat out told us
we would never have kids.

30:00.232 --> 30:01.965
- Ouch. That must've been...

30:03.068 --> 30:06.570
- It was. It ate us up
for a long time.

30:08.040 --> 30:10.974
But we eventually moved on,
because we had to.

30:12.177 --> 30:14.912
We had to stop crying about
the one thing we couldn't have,

30:15.047 --> 30:16.947
and just... I don't know,

30:17.950 --> 30:19.716
let life come to us.

30:21.020 --> 30:23.120
And you know what happened?

30:24.189 --> 30:26.122
- Marion?

30:26.124 --> 30:27.390
- Yeah.

30:27.459 --> 30:29.459
Our little miracle baby.

30:29.594 --> 30:32.129
- Wow. That is amazing.

30:33.198 --> 30:35.065
- Well, like I say,
we wanted more,

30:35.134 --> 30:39.069
but it wasn't in the cards,
so to speak.

30:41.139 --> 30:44.308
I have no problem with the hand
we were dealt.

30:50.583 --> 30:52.215
- Ah... that, that is tasty.

30:52.217 --> 30:54.184
- It is, isn't it?

30:55.087 --> 30:59.555

come to us once in a while.

bucks,

Don't you mean $2,000?

the Hudson Cancer Society

they had an inferior team

- Cheers to our big win.
(Women laugh)

39:43.148 --> 39:46.148
- It's so nice to sit back
and relax.

39:46.184 --> 39:48.551
Oh, I'm sorry I almost let
that cow go by.

39:48.553 --> 39:49.986
I almost cost us
the whole thing.

39:49.988 --> 39:53.088
- Hey! First of all,
stop gloating,

39:53.125 --> 39:55.691
it's not ladylike,
and second of all,

39:55.727 --> 39:58.494
you don't need to be ashamed
about anything.

39:58.563 --> 40:00.229
That was a gutsy display today.

40:00.365 --> 40:02.765
That was a big step along
the way to getting back

40:02.834 --> 40:06.102
to bronc riding,
I mean, when you're ready.

40:06.171 --> 40:08.905
- Yeah, about the broncs.

40:08.907 --> 40:10.507
My shoulder's feeling
a lot better,

40:10.509 --> 40:13.676
and I wanna ride in the rodeo
tomorrow.

40:13.812 --> 40:16.045
- Tomorrow?

40:16.181 --> 40:18.848
Well, I mean, I'll support you,
whatever you wanna do,

40:18.917 --> 40:21.317
but... you sure about that?

40:21.319 --> 40:23.019
- Yeah, I'm good to go.

40:24.589 --> 40:27.190
- Okay, a little less talking,
a little more digging, huh?

40:27.325 --> 40:29.058
(Laughs)

40:32.697 --> 40:34.063
- Ohh... oy yoy yoy.

40:34.099 --> 40:36.199
Dig, dig. Do the--
- Okay.

40:36.201 --> 40:37.634
- That's not a corner.

40:42.808 --> 40:47.210
♪♪♪

40:47.212 --> 40:48.811
- Brought you a little
something.

40:48.847 --> 40:50.746
- Oh, you didn't have
to do that.

40:50.748 --> 40:51.948
- Oh, I did.

40:52.017 --> 40:54.217
It's a thank you for
the other night.

40:54.286 --> 40:55.751
I had a long talk with Cass
this morning,

40:55.821 --> 40:59.355
and we've decided we're done
with the specialists.

40:59.357 --> 41:00.890
We're just gonna let the chips
fall where they may,

41:00.959 --> 41:03.959
and get back to being grateful
for all the wonderful things

41:03.995 --> 41:05.962
we do have in our life.

41:07.098 --> 41:09.232
- Well, you can swing by
and have a taste of this

41:09.301 --> 41:10.633
with me anytime.

41:11.769 --> 41:13.169
- I think I'll stick
to beer for a while,

41:13.238 --> 41:14.771
One night of whiskey
was enough.

41:14.906 --> 41:16.639
- (Laughs)

41:18.844 --> 41:21.744
- Thanks, Jack.
- You bet.

41:25.350 --> 41:27.116
(Knocking)

41:28.320 --> 41:30.587
- Hey.

41:30.722 --> 41:32.055
- You didn't come down
for breakfast,

41:32.190 --> 41:34.356
I thought I'd bring some up.

41:34.392 --> 41:36.759
- Did you take the yolks out?

41:36.795 --> 41:39.896
- No. But I did spare you
the bacon.

41:40.966 --> 41:42.799
- Okay, thanks.

41:46.171 --> 41:47.937
