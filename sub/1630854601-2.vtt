WEBVTT

00:01.751 --> 00:03.959
New boat, new location.

00:03.959 --> 00:05.626
Ah!

00:05.626 --> 00:06.792
How are you?

00:06.792 --> 00:07.959
New crew.

00:07.959 --> 00:08.959
This is the deck team,
I believe.

00:08.959 --> 00:10.375
-Oh, wow.
-Awesome.

00:10.375 --> 00:13.709
Camille, you're gonna
share her with the deck.

00:13.709 --> 00:14.959
That's what I like to see!

00:14.959 --> 00:17.375
Yay!

00:17.375 --> 00:20.167
I am a little incapacitated.

00:20.167 --> 00:22.209
I have a nerve issue
on my left side.

00:22.209 --> 00:26.417
So, I am going to depend
on you guys in some areas.

00:26.417 --> 00:28.959
Alissa, I'm thinking
of making you my second.

00:28.959 --> 00:30.167
Okay.

00:30.167 --> 00:33.042
I am going to
absolutely smash it.

00:33.042 --> 00:35.584
Peng Lim, tax professional,

00:35.584 --> 00:37.792
joined by his best
friends for his birthday.

00:37.792 --> 00:39.250
-Oh!
-Ooh!

00:39.250 --> 00:40.792
Get a towel, towel!

00:40.792 --> 00:45.792
Fraser?

00:45.792 --> 00:47.083
Oh, I'm so bored.

00:47.083 --> 00:48.167
This is taking forever.

00:48.167 --> 00:49.375
This is an empty fridge.

00:49.375 --> 00:50.751
You should just stock a fridge

00:50.751 --> 00:52.459
so I don't have to tell
you how to do it.

00:52.459 --> 01:05.250
There's a way to lead,
and there's bossing.

01:05.250 --> 01:06.792
I just told you the fridge
wasn't stocked.

01:06.792 --> 01:10.334
Stock it with whatever you want,
as long as it's full.

01:10.334 --> 01:12.876
Stocking a fridge with
800 water bottles

01:12.876 --> 01:14.959
when they leave in a day?
Please.

01:14.959 --> 01:17.792
Babe, like, it's easy.

01:17.792 --> 01:19.459
Camille should respect the fact

01:19.459 --> 01:23.792
that Fraser's entrusted me
with the second stew position.

01:23.792 --> 01:25.417
I don't need your
----ing attitude

01:25.417 --> 01:27.959
when I'm literally
just trying to do my job,

01:27.959 --> 01:30.083
and it's just ----ing bad vibes.

01:30.083 --> 01:31.959
That's stocked, fully.

01:31.959 --> 01:40.792
-Okay. Go to bed.
-Cool, thanks.

01:40.792 --> 01:43.083
Ooh, really?

01:43.083 --> 01:51.417
Good night, moon.

01:51.417 --> 01:56.959
[grunting]

01:56.959 --> 02:02.083
[grunting]

02:02.083 --> 02:08.959
[grunting]

02:08.959 --> 02:11.959
Working out is
super-important for me.

02:11.959 --> 02:13.792
It's how I deal
with my stress.

02:13.792 --> 02:16.959
In 2011, I got really depressed.

02:16.959 --> 02:18.584
My dad was sick, you know?

02:18.584 --> 02:21.417
And the thing that got me
out of it was working out.

02:21.417 --> 02:24.292
I tried to find a
healthy way to deal with that.

02:24.292 --> 02:27.918
You're replacing soul pain
with physical pain,

02:27.918 --> 02:31.417
you understand
what I'm saying?

02:31.417 --> 02:32.751
[alarm beeps]

02:32.751 --> 02:38.334
I'm exhausted.

02:38.334 --> 02:46.751
[bleep]

02:46.751 --> 02:47.751
Is there guests up?

02:47.751 --> 02:48.959
-No.
-Okay, good.

02:48.959 --> 02:50.083
-Hey.
-Hi, darling.

02:50.083 --> 02:51.584
Okay, so...

02:51.584 --> 02:53.834
Right, so, if you
absolutely despise this...

02:53.834 --> 02:55.584
-Did you do this this morning?
-I won't get offended.

02:55.584 --> 02:56.584
Brilliant!

02:56.584 --> 02:57.501
Day one was bad.

02:57.501 --> 02:59.584
Wasn't feeling very good
about things

02:59.584 --> 03:03.334
and the future of my career on
board Motor Yacht St. David.

03:03.334 --> 03:04.459
They'll definitely
want a bread plate.

03:04.459 --> 03:05.459
Yeah.

03:05.459 --> 03:08.000
We need to work harder
and better and smarter.

03:08.000 --> 03:10.959
How we're going to do that,
I'm not sure, but I'm...

03:10.959 --> 03:12.792
I like the enthusiasm, Fras.

03:12.792 --> 03:14.751
And if we could use
the coasters as well.

03:14.751 --> 03:16.292
Yeah, okay.

03:16.292 --> 03:17.375
All right, cool, we'll just
get that corner there,

03:17.375 --> 03:18.584
where all the
glitter is.

03:18.584 --> 03:19.626
Oh, yeah.

03:19.626 --> 03:21.542
-Good morning.
-Hi.

03:21.542 --> 03:23.626
How are you feeling?

03:23.626 --> 03:25.501
What can I get you,
would you like a coffee?

03:25.501 --> 03:29.918
Can I do a... yeah.

03:29.918 --> 03:31.209
That's brilliant.

03:31.209 --> 03:33.792
Ugh.

03:33.792 --> 03:35.792
Who the hell gets
up that early

03:35.792 --> 03:42.501
after getting absolutely
sh---faced the night before?

03:42.501 --> 03:44.375
[vomits]

03:44.375 --> 03:45.792
Peng!

03:45.792 --> 03:48.584
I'm never drinking again.

03:48.584 --> 03:51.876
What we have available now is a
double-chocolate paleo muffin.

03:51.876 --> 03:55.918
We can do some eggs,
bacon, sausages.

03:55.918 --> 03:59.459
Yeah, sure.

03:59.459 --> 04:04.501
They don't want any carbs,
just want scrambled.

04:04.501 --> 04:07.501
Hayley, just start with
master, then go to VIP.

04:07.501 --> 04:09.626
Yep.

04:09.626 --> 04:10.626
Lovely.

04:10.626 --> 04:13.292
Ugh.

04:13.292 --> 04:15.167
We've got some truffle oil
for you as well.

04:15.167 --> 04:16.709
Oh, my gosh, this is amazing.

04:16.709 --> 04:18.834
So, for today, eventually,
we'll get to the beach.

04:18.834 --> 04:20.167
Oh, sweet, I love that.

04:20.167 --> 04:21.751
-Hey.
-Good morning.

04:21.751 --> 04:23.751
Nice, you guys have done
a good job around here.

04:23.751 --> 04:24.959
There was glitter everywhere
this morning.

04:24.959 --> 04:26.292
Covered in glitter.

04:26.292 --> 04:29.959
-You all right?
-Yeah, I'm fine.

04:29.959 --> 04:32.375
I know that you told Camille

04:32.375 --> 04:33.584
to finish up the sky lounge,
and then...

04:33.584 --> 04:34.459
Yes.

04:34.459 --> 04:36.459
...she stomped her
feet a little bit

04:36.459 --> 04:37.792
at the fact that I was asking
her to vacuum up the crew area.

04:37.792 --> 04:39.292
Okay.

04:39.292 --> 04:40.375
I think a lot of this is
just coming down to the fact

04:40.375 --> 04:41.584
that we're all over the place.

04:41.584 --> 04:42.417
It's a whole mess.

04:42.417 --> 04:44.167
-I just...
-Thank you for telling me.

04:44.167 --> 04:45.417
I'm gonna speak to her
at some point.

04:45.417 --> 04:47.375
I appreciate the
communication from Alissa.

04:47.375 --> 04:48.834
It's not the best news.

04:48.834 --> 04:50.584
In my last experience as chief,

04:50.584 --> 04:52.792
you know, I feel like I
let people off quite a lot,

04:52.792 --> 04:54.709
and so I need to be
a bit more of a bitch.

04:54.709 --> 04:56.459
No, thank you so much
for that communication.

04:56.459 --> 04:58.167
-Good morning, Captain.
-Morning, Ross.

04:58.167 --> 04:59.167
How are you doing?

04:59.167 --> 05:00.250
Well... Better.

05:00.250 --> 05:01.834
That's good to hear.

05:01.834 --> 05:03.334
They want to spend the day at
the beach. Hangout, lunch.

05:03.334 --> 05:04.667
Well, we should get
that ready, then.

05:04.667 --> 05:06.167
Yeah.

05:06.167 --> 05:08.000
We're gonna turn the shots
into screwdrivers.

05:08.000 --> 05:10.501
Oh, brilliant.

05:10.501 --> 05:11.542
Good morning.

05:11.542 --> 05:13.167
Are you just
enjoying the banana?

05:13.167 --> 05:14.876
-Yes.
-Perfect.

05:14.876 --> 05:17.292
Put your shot in this.
This is just plain orange juice.

05:17.292 --> 05:20.292
-Bottoms up.
-Got it?

05:20.292 --> 05:22.000
That's it, wrap it around
the cleat straightaway.

05:22.000 --> 05:23.792
-Yes, Katie!
-Yeah.

05:23.792 --> 05:25.459
All right, I'll give you
that to hold again.

05:25.459 --> 05:27.626
I haven't been on a boat
this size before,

05:27.626 --> 05:30.459
but I'm hardworking,
I'll work extra hours.

05:30.459 --> 05:32.167
I wanna be right up there
doing the exact same things

05:32.167 --> 05:34.125
as the guys, doing the
same amount of effort.

05:34.125 --> 05:35.459
-He's good.
-Right on.

05:35.459 --> 05:37.167
I would love to own my own boat.

05:37.167 --> 05:38.667
That's my ultimate goal.

05:38.667 --> 05:41.250
Me being 30, it would be
awesome down the road if,

05:41.250 --> 05:43.709
you know, I would have a
family and be able to show,

05:43.709 --> 05:45.292
like, my passion to them.

05:45.292 --> 05:49.626
-Excellent job.
-Yeah, thank you.

05:49.626 --> 05:50.959
Mm!

05:50.959 --> 05:52.334
And then, you know, like
vegetable spring rolls.

05:52.334 --> 05:53.125
Yeah.

05:53.125 --> 05:54.667
Peng is from Thailand,

05:54.667 --> 05:57.125
so I can't wait to prepare
this cuisine for him.

05:57.125 --> 05:59.959
Many, many years ago,
I studied in Thailand.

05:59.959 --> 06:01.709
Where I lived is Soi Cowboy,

06:01.709 --> 06:04.334
it's where all the lady boys
party and have nightclubs there.

06:04.334 --> 06:08.501
I call it "saweadykak"
instead of "sawadika,"

06:08.501 --> 06:11.751
which is "hello"
and "goodbye."

06:11.751 --> 06:13.167
Oh, you mean are these
little serving boxes?

06:13.167 --> 06:14.834
That's brilliant.

06:14.834 --> 06:17.667
We can go with this light chair.

06:17.667 --> 06:18.959
[laughing]

06:18.959 --> 06:20.167
-That's it?
-Yep.

06:20.167 --> 06:21.167
All right, good luck, guys.

06:21.167 --> 06:22.542
See you in a couple of weeks.

06:22.542 --> 06:23.751
You and Alissa are
gonna go to the beach.

06:23.751 --> 06:25.417
You don't wanna go?

06:25.417 --> 06:26.626
You need to be helping with
the service, if that's okay.

06:26.626 --> 06:27.959
Absolutely.

06:27.959 --> 06:29.000
And then I've got someone
coming to do

06:29.000 --> 06:30.792
the Reiki sound bath thing.

06:30.792 --> 06:32.751
-I'll do a spicy margarita.
-I'll do a Moscow mule.

06:32.751 --> 06:33.959
Great.

06:33.959 --> 06:36.501
Tequila, sprite,
pineapple, Moscow mule...

06:36.501 --> 06:37.417
oh sh--.

06:37.417 --> 06:40.125
-Loads of things.
-Oh, that's perfect.

06:40.125 --> 06:44.292
All right, let's go.

06:44.292 --> 06:45.959
Okay, I have tons
of different drinks.

06:45.959 --> 06:47.459
Yay!

06:47.459 --> 06:50.959
Romantic, I'll tell you that.

06:50.959 --> 06:51.959
-Hey.
-Hi.

06:51.959 --> 06:53.000
There is the Red Bull, sir?

06:53.000 --> 06:54.709
Okay, are these for us?

06:54.709 --> 06:57.125
Said he wanted to have, like,
some sugar, and so I got him...

06:57.125 --> 06:58.751
No, I think
he wanted it for you.

06:58.751 --> 07:01.751
-Yes.
-No, no, no!

07:01.751 --> 07:02.959
[laughing]

07:02.959 --> 07:03.959
How you doing?

07:03.959 --> 07:05.417
Good, everything's so nice.

07:05.417 --> 07:06.709
Good, I'm gonna send
the guests straightaway.

07:06.709 --> 07:08.167
Just do whatever you can
to make the happy.

07:08.167 --> 07:10.792
What drink would you like?

07:10.792 --> 07:12.000
Perfect.

07:12.000 --> 07:13.709
Can you move these
coolers behind the tree?

07:13.709 --> 07:17.834
Yeah... can you move those
coolers behind the tree?

07:17.834 --> 07:18.876
What's your go-to dance move?

07:18.876 --> 07:20.375
The shopping cart?

07:20.375 --> 07:21.542
Do you have one?

07:21.542 --> 07:23.709
Do you know, actually,
it's quite similar to that.

07:23.709 --> 07:24.918
Just, like, the...

07:24.918 --> 07:26.959
-What?
-Isn't that a twerk?

07:26.959 --> 07:28.167
Quite a lazy one, actually.

07:28.167 --> 07:31.626
[laughing]

07:31.626 --> 07:32.709
-We ready to go?
-Yes.

07:32.709 --> 07:34.459
To the swim platform,
whenever you're ready.

07:34.459 --> 07:35.876
-Carry me!
-Can I do anything for you?

07:35.876 --> 07:37.083
Let's go ahead and
cling-wrap this down.

07:37.083 --> 07:38.375
Okay.

07:38.375 --> 07:39.417
Go, you find me a bowl,
and I'll cling.

07:39.417 --> 07:40.459
Two, three, four, five, six...

07:40.459 --> 07:41.959
I've just been wanting to swim,

07:41.959 --> 07:43.751
and I really need
to get in some water.

07:43.751 --> 07:46.626
-Are you allowed to?
-I don't know.

07:46.626 --> 07:47.959
I'm a free human being.

07:47.959 --> 07:49.501
You don't wanna ask?

07:49.501 --> 07:51.501
What's the use in coming all
the way down here

07:51.501 --> 07:54.334
and treating yourself
like someone who's just

07:54.334 --> 07:56.292
there to serve and do
everything for everybody else?

07:56.292 --> 07:58.918
I just need to get in the water,
in the Caribbean.

07:58.918 --> 07:59.959
I have to.

07:59.959 --> 08:02.167
Yachting is supposed to be fun.

08:02.167 --> 08:03.667
She just took off her shirt?

08:03.667 --> 08:05.501
Well, not something I would
do on charter, but...

08:05.501 --> 08:07.584
Yeah, that is definitely not
something I would do on charter.

08:07.584 --> 08:10.918
I'm not even
looking over there.

08:10.918 --> 08:13.334
Alissa, the guests,
they are on their way now.

08:13.334 --> 08:14.667
-Copy that.
-Woo!

08:14.667 --> 08:18.834
You know, we're supposed
to be working.

08:18.834 --> 08:22.000
But apparently, Ben and Camille
really don't give a [bleep].

08:22.000 --> 08:24.834
Why would she do that?
Like, that's disrespectful.

08:24.834 --> 08:25.918
This is not your time right now.

08:25.918 --> 08:30.375
Exactly.

08:30.375 --> 08:33.000
Not something I would do on
charter, but...

08:33.000 --> 08:35.375
Yeah, that is definitely not
something I would do on charter.

08:35.375 --> 08:37.000
The guests, they are
on their way now.

08:37.000 --> 08:39.751
Copy that.

08:39.751 --> 08:40.959
Fraser just called on the radio.

08:40.959 --> 08:42.375
The guests are coming.

08:42.375 --> 08:43.792
Alissa, is this them?

08:43.792 --> 08:46.584
Oh sh--.

08:46.584 --> 08:48.918
-This is the biggest I have.
-That's perfect.

08:48.918 --> 08:50.375
Good afternoon, hello.

08:50.375 --> 08:52.125
I'm Dr. Tanya, how are you?

08:52.125 --> 08:53.584
Dr. Tanya, it is
a pleasure to meet you.

08:53.584 --> 08:54.959
I'm here to do the sound bath.

08:54.959 --> 08:56.918
I do understand
that that is true.

08:56.918 --> 08:57.959
-Hi, guys.
-Hi.

08:57.959 --> 08:59.417
Welcome!

08:59.417 --> 09:01.375
I would ----ing give my
right leg to be drinking tequila

09:01.375 --> 09:03.125
on a superyacht right now.

09:03.125 --> 09:05.042
Oh, I love this,
this is so pretty.

09:05.042 --> 09:06.209
Welcome.

09:06.209 --> 09:07.209
Alissa is always
ready with drinks.

09:07.209 --> 09:08.792
Here we are.

09:08.792 --> 09:11.584
If you haven't caught on,
that's all we do.

09:11.584 --> 09:14.584
Well, I'm glad.

09:14.584 --> 09:16.042
-Is it?
-Yes.

09:16.042 --> 09:18.834
I should try it sometime.

09:18.834 --> 09:22.167
I'm gonna walk you
over to our cabana.

09:22.167 --> 09:23.542
This is Dr. Tanya.

09:23.542 --> 09:25.250
We're gonna do a sound bath.

09:25.250 --> 09:27.459
It's usually better that
I'm seated in the center

09:27.459 --> 09:37.167
and you around,
so I invite you to sit.

09:37.167 --> 09:44.000
Bring Tony over.

09:44.000 --> 09:45.876
[snoring]

09:45.876 --> 09:47.876
God, they're so soft I wanna
make out with them.

09:47.876 --> 09:49.375
Is that weird?

09:49.375 --> 09:53.209
That's it...
this can go.

09:53.209 --> 09:55.584
I slept.
That was an experience.

09:55.584 --> 09:57.751
Fraser, they are wrapping
up the sound bath.

09:57.751 --> 10:01.334
Okay, we're heading towards
you now with lunch.

10:01.334 --> 10:01.959
Copy.

10:01.959 --> 10:03.250
Oh, you're coming as well?

10:03.250 --> 10:04.959
Yeah, I've gotta do the service.

10:04.959 --> 10:07.792
I'm gonna be so paranoid that
there's, like, a bug on me.

10:07.792 --> 10:09.792
Hang on, hang on.

10:09.792 --> 10:11.334
Take the plastic off and put
it anywhere on the table.

10:11.334 --> 10:12.667
-Yep, yep.
-Everything is sharing platters.

10:12.667 --> 10:15.042
-Y'all are hungry?
-Yes, we are.

10:15.042 --> 10:16.542
Thank you.

10:16.542 --> 10:18.334
Ah!

10:18.334 --> 10:19.834
I was gonna drag you
in headfirst.

10:19.834 --> 10:22.501
-Ah!
-You're in.

10:22.501 --> 10:24.417
Hello...
ooh, how you doing?

10:24.417 --> 10:30.459
Hopefully in a day or two
I can get rid of these things.

10:30.459 --> 10:33.209
It's been, shall we say,
a bit challenging.

10:33.209 --> 10:35.042
I'm gonna go up and
get some stretching done.

10:35.042 --> 10:38.792
Pain's gone, I just don't
look so pretty when I walk.

10:38.792 --> 10:45.959
But I was never gonna be
a runway model anyhow.

10:45.959 --> 10:47.334
Goddamn it.

10:47.334 --> 10:48.792
Okay, so just so you know,

10:48.792 --> 10:50.792
in these little boxes
here we have bao buns.

10:50.792 --> 10:52.792
This side salad stuff.

10:52.792 --> 10:55.751
Pad Thai here, and here,
we've got a soup for you.

10:55.751 --> 10:57.375
This is so good.

10:57.375 --> 11:00.334
Growing up, this is what my mom
would make me to go to school.

11:00.334 --> 11:01.626
All the kids would
make fun of me.

11:01.626 --> 11:03.959
Mom, the kids with bologna
are teasing me.

11:03.959 --> 11:05.209
-Yeah.
-Right?

11:05.209 --> 11:07.167
-That's how we do.
-How was it?

11:07.167 --> 11:08.542
I'm gonna sit down
for two minutes.

11:08.542 --> 11:10.125
I quite enjoy it, it's just...

11:10.125 --> 11:12.000
Well, yeah, it must be
nice to just be outside.

11:12.000 --> 11:13.417
I've forgotten what
that looks like.

11:13.417 --> 11:16.375
Dinner, are you still
aiming for 8:30?

11:16.375 --> 11:17.501
Mm-hmm, yeah, that works.

11:17.501 --> 11:19.209
These are heavy, so let the...

11:19.209 --> 11:24.209
-Okay, gimme the lighter bags.
-Let the boys get them.

11:24.209 --> 11:26.709
I think he's got more
than that, actually.

11:26.709 --> 11:28.501
-Nice.
-There you go.

11:28.501 --> 11:30.834
How in the hell?

11:30.834 --> 11:33.709
Tony, show us your abs!

11:33.709 --> 11:35.584
Do it, do it!

11:35.584 --> 11:36.959
Okay, okay, later.

11:36.959 --> 11:41.959
-Ooh!
-Later?

11:41.959 --> 11:44.209
Jeez, I nearly drowned.

11:44.209 --> 11:45.918
Oh, look at that sunset.

11:45.918 --> 11:48.125
Me and Ross are going for a
real romantic ride right now.

11:48.125 --> 11:50.417
-Oh, my God.
-I know, right?

11:50.417 --> 11:55.542
One, two, and three...
go, yee-ooh!

11:55.542 --> 12:00.792
Oh, come on!

12:00.792 --> 12:03.876
There we go, yee-ooh!

12:03.876 --> 12:04.876
It's just too much.

12:04.876 --> 12:05.959
What?

12:05.959 --> 12:07.083
This bed is in
too much disarray.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.334
I'm definitely a perfectionist.

12:08.334 --> 12:09.959
I know that my team need
to step it up,

12:09.959 --> 12:13.876
but mummy loves a challenge,
and I'm gonna give it a good go.

12:13.876 --> 12:15.626
-Hey.
-Hi.

12:15.626 --> 12:16.959
What are you doing?

12:16.959 --> 12:18.667
Everything, yeah.

12:18.667 --> 12:21.250
Yeah. Yeah.

12:21.250 --> 12:22.959
-Coming in hot.
-Coming in hot, no fenders.

12:22.959 --> 12:24.459
Oh!

12:24.459 --> 12:26.167
Just so I can know,
are we doing plated tonight?

12:26.167 --> 12:27.792
-No, family-style.
-Family-style, okay.

12:27.792 --> 12:29.459
Surf-n-turf all day.

12:29.459 --> 12:31.751
It's very important for this
dinner to go really well,

12:31.751 --> 12:33.334
because I mean, come on...

12:33.334 --> 12:36.918
we can't have, you know,
a repeat of the day before.

12:36.918 --> 12:40.792
Once those guests experience
something that is subpar,

12:40.792 --> 12:43.375
now we've got a problem, because
then you have to work harder

12:43.375 --> 12:45.626
to make them feel
more comfortable.

12:45.626 --> 12:47.751
I gotta go pee.

12:47.751 --> 12:49.459
All right, guys, let's try
and have some showers.

12:49.459 --> 12:50.792
I can shower now?

12:50.792 --> 12:51.792
Not, like, a group shower.

12:51.792 --> 12:53.042
We got this...

12:53.042 --> 12:54.542
I know, we have
a family shower here.

12:54.542 --> 12:56.751
-The deck team shower.
-Deck shower, deck shower!

12:56.751 --> 12:58.209
Used to Miami, eh?

12:58.209 --> 12:59.751
Hayley, I'm just
going to get changed,

12:59.751 --> 13:01.834
and then I'm gonna
swap out with Camille,

13:01.834 --> 13:03.792
and then you're going
to swap out.

13:03.792 --> 13:05.167
No problem, thank you.

13:05.167 --> 13:08.375
Thank you so much.

13:08.375 --> 13:10.375
All crew, I've got some
dress-up clothing

13:10.375 --> 13:13.959
for a Playboy Mansion
debaucherous evening.

13:13.959 --> 13:22.542
Girl, I'll shake it...

13:22.542 --> 13:25.083
People quite regularly
tell me that.

13:25.083 --> 13:26.792
I have wanked over myself.

13:26.792 --> 13:30.667
I've actually taken pictures
of my body and wanked over it.

13:30.667 --> 13:35.000
I have, I've masturbated over
photos of me, to be honest.

13:35.000 --> 13:38.000
I've got a banging
pair of tits.

13:38.000 --> 13:39.209
Pretty proud of them,
to be fair.

13:39.209 --> 13:40.375
Do you know what's really funny,

13:40.375 --> 13:43.083
-when you said--
-Oh, God!

13:43.083 --> 13:44.083
What have you done?

13:44.083 --> 13:45.250
Inhaled loads of water.

13:45.250 --> 13:47.083
-What, through your nose?
-Mm.

13:47.083 --> 13:48.167
I got all kerfuffled.

13:48.167 --> 13:49.375
Oh, you got a bit overwhelmed.

13:49.375 --> 13:50.751
Yeah, I got overwhelmed,
yeah, mm.

13:50.751 --> 13:52.125
What is this?

13:52.125 --> 13:53.375
Is this a blindfold,
like, a pretend one?

13:53.375 --> 13:54.709
No, it's a garter, you...

13:54.709 --> 13:56.334
Jeez.

13:56.334 --> 14:01.125
Fraser, what are
those handcuffs?

14:01.125 --> 14:07.751
One of us has been bad.

14:07.751 --> 14:09.834
What do you think?

14:09.834 --> 14:11.709
It smells pretty foul.

14:11.709 --> 14:23.792
Yeah, it was defrosted
as of yesterday.

14:23.792 --> 14:26.751
I got 45 pounds of frozen fish.

14:26.751 --> 14:29.709
Now I realize it was
not frozen fresh.

14:29.709 --> 14:31.584
Dinner is ----ed.

14:31.584 --> 14:33.792
Ooh.

14:33.792 --> 14:36.292
-Oh, my [bleep].
-Fraser, Rachel.

14:36.292 --> 14:41.584
Go ahead, Rachel.

14:41.584 --> 14:42.876
Is it ready?

14:42.876 --> 14:45.709
The branzino smells really off,
and it's grey on the inside.

14:45.709 --> 14:49.167
How awful.

14:49.167 --> 14:50.167
Coming up...

14:50.167 --> 14:52.000
What is happening?

14:52.000 --> 14:53.792
Cap, Cap, that is
port side anchor

14:53.792 --> 14:53.792
ready for emergency drop.

14:53.792 --> 15:03.542
Not something I would do on
charter, but...

15:03.542 --> 15:05.542
Cheers.

15:05.542 --> 15:08.042
The branzino smells really off,
and it's grey on the inside.

15:08.042 --> 15:09.375
How awful.

15:09.375 --> 15:11.375
It smells like deadliest
snatch over here.

15:11.375 --> 15:13.375
I can't have
a repeat of last night.

15:13.375 --> 15:15.167
Now I've gotta pull off
a surf-n-turf dinner

15:15.167 --> 15:16.751
without ----ing surf.

15:16.751 --> 15:19.626
I can do the steak, I can do,
like, truffle fries, I can do...

15:19.626 --> 15:21.375
They would love that
kind of stuff.

15:21.375 --> 15:23.751
-Okay.
-Babe, nailed it, totally fine.

15:23.751 --> 15:28.250
I hate my ----ing life.

15:28.250 --> 15:30.292
----ing son of a bitch.

15:30.292 --> 15:33.959
-Fraser, Lee.
-Go ahead, Captain.

15:33.959 --> 15:35.542
Debaucherous playboy.

15:35.542 --> 15:36.626
Mother----er.

15:36.626 --> 15:49.876
This is what you gotta wear,
we're gonna match.

15:49.876 --> 15:51.000
Of course I like my abs.

15:51.000 --> 15:52.334
You know, I like them, you know?

15:52.334 --> 15:54.584
But I like them because
what of things

15:54.584 --> 15:59.626
that I can do
a lot of the time.

15:59.626 --> 16:05.167
Yeah, sometimes I do feel like
a piece of meat, you know?

16:05.167 --> 16:06.459
Do you want this undone?

16:06.459 --> 16:07.751
I think you should
undo it one more.

16:07.751 --> 16:09.209
That's okay, we
have a costume change.

16:09.209 --> 16:10.542
Will you pull that up for me?

16:10.542 --> 16:13.751
-Over?
-Oh, no, no, that's perfect.

16:13.751 --> 16:15.250
All right, here we go.

16:15.250 --> 16:16.751
What's going on here?

16:16.751 --> 16:19.000
I'm dressing up.

16:19.000 --> 16:21.000
It's gonna be hard to
concentrate on anything else.

16:21.000 --> 16:24.167
Shut up.

16:24.167 --> 16:25.209
Do we need help... what...
do we need...

16:25.209 --> 16:26.375
what am I doing?

16:26.375 --> 16:28.959
Yeah, yeah, just jump in
and go to work.

16:28.959 --> 16:31.375
All right, do you want me
to walk up the stairs

16:31.375 --> 16:33.209
and see what's going on?

16:33.209 --> 16:35.959
Yeah, sure, you...

16:35.959 --> 16:37.292
Yeah?

16:37.292 --> 16:40.000
Do enjoy the company
of the fairer sex.

16:40.000 --> 16:41.667
"Sex" being the operative word.

16:41.667 --> 16:47.959
I mean, it's enjoyable,
isn't it?

16:47.959 --> 16:49.876
So, who do you
think fancies who?

16:49.876 --> 16:51.167
I think Camille fancies Ben.

16:51.167 --> 16:52.792
She definitely likes him.

16:52.792 --> 16:54.292
Is it bad if I still
wanna flirt with Ben?

16:54.292 --> 17:00.250
You would get him in trouble.

17:00.250 --> 17:01.334
Ooh, that looks nice, eh?

17:01.334 --> 17:03.334
Captain, Captain, Fraser.

17:03.334 --> 17:04.751
Just sat everyone at the table.

17:04.751 --> 17:06.459
Just toss me right
to the wolves.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.083
Can you jump down
to cabins, please?

17:08.083 --> 17:11.125
Yes.

17:11.125 --> 17:12.584
Hello!

17:12.584 --> 17:16.042
Good evening, everyone.
Thank you for inviting me.

17:16.042 --> 17:17.042
Yes!

17:17.042 --> 17:18.501
So, how is everybody doing?

17:18.501 --> 17:19.751
Good, good.

17:19.751 --> 17:22.167
I'm sorry I've been absent,
got a little nerve issue.

17:22.167 --> 17:23.959
It'll hopefully resolve itself.

17:23.959 --> 17:27.584
Till then, I'm the best you got.

17:27.584 --> 17:29.501
It's extremely uncomfortable,

17:29.501 --> 17:32.209
but you can't just
toss in the towel.

17:32.209 --> 17:37.959
Suck it up, cupcake.

17:37.959 --> 17:41.501
After party?

17:41.501 --> 17:45.667
If I'm not there,
start without me.

17:45.667 --> 17:46.542
She's a 10!

17:46.542 --> 17:48.334
We've been married
22 years, so...

17:48.334 --> 17:50.167
-Congratulations.
-Thank you!

17:50.167 --> 17:52.542
You have large feet, too.

17:52.542 --> 17:54.083
-Look at it.
-You have one large toe?

17:54.083 --> 17:55.417
Oh, yeah.

17:55.417 --> 17:57.375
I mean, we got divorced
in the middle of it,

17:57.375 --> 17:58.792
and then we
remarried each other.

17:58.792 --> 18:00.459
-I love it.
-Okay.

18:00.459 --> 18:01.959
It means you're the head
of the household?

18:01.959 --> 18:04.209
No, it means I'm...

18:04.209 --> 18:06.792
Are you?
I'm not. I gag.

18:06.792 --> 18:08.250
Are you not?

18:08.250 --> 18:11.250
Oh, that is such a horrible
thing to have to admit.

18:11.250 --> 18:12.459
I used to when I was younger,

18:12.459 --> 18:13.959
just be like...
all the time...

18:13.959 --> 18:14.959
like, not all the time...

18:14.959 --> 18:16.125
Sorry, what were you like?

18:16.125 --> 18:17.417
I'm not gonna do it.

18:17.417 --> 18:18.959
-[gagging noise]
-I'm not gonna do it.

18:18.959 --> 18:20.792
Fraser, Fraser,
I'm about to serve right now.

18:20.792 --> 18:22.334
Copy that.

18:22.334 --> 18:23.584
We're gonna go with the
mushrooms and the truffle fries.

18:23.584 --> 18:25.167
I can only do one
at a time, though.

18:25.167 --> 18:27.042
Steak and Brussels
sprouts with maple syrup.

18:27.042 --> 18:28.375
Wow, babe.

18:28.375 --> 18:35.375
Oh, they're truffle fries.

18:35.375 --> 18:40.542
Rachel is a treasure.

18:40.542 --> 18:42.250
Welcome to the deck
evening meeting.

18:42.250 --> 18:44.292
We need to switch some people
round on the rota.

18:44.292 --> 18:46.959
Ben, I need you till 2:00 a.m.

18:46.959 --> 18:49.584
Tony, you're gonna stick
to the same as usual, 5:30.

18:49.584 --> 18:51.626
Hey, I'm supposed to
go to bed, like, now.

18:51.626 --> 18:55.959
So, I mean, I can
just escape this, eh?

18:55.959 --> 18:57.083
Thank you very much, guys.

18:57.083 --> 18:58.792
-Yeah!
-Let's go.

18:58.792 --> 19:00.834
Love you guys.

19:00.834 --> 19:09.918
I love you guys.

19:09.918 --> 19:12.959
This is a tough room, isn't it?

19:12.959 --> 19:14.334
Literally attack.

19:14.334 --> 19:16.792
Everybody's a slut
and ho and a hooker.

19:16.792 --> 19:17.834
You know what...

19:17.834 --> 19:19.792
That's why we're having
a debauchery party.

19:19.792 --> 19:25.584
Speak for yourself, honey.

19:25.584 --> 19:27.334
Chef, we're ready for dessert.

19:27.334 --> 19:28.792
Running these, it's ice cream.

19:28.792 --> 19:30.042
Super cool.

19:30.042 --> 19:31.626
This is a strawberry
sorbet, Rachel?

19:31.626 --> 19:36.584
Yes, ma'am.

19:36.584 --> 19:41.167
Strawberry sorbet.

19:41.167 --> 19:42.417
Thank you.

19:42.417 --> 19:44.709
Somehow, some way,
we pulled it off.

19:44.709 --> 19:47.209
----ing winning!

19:47.209 --> 19:50.042
This is great.

19:50.042 --> 19:51.375
Well, thank you all so much.

19:51.375 --> 19:53.042
Thank you very much.
Thank you so much.

19:53.042 --> 19:54.751
-I appreciate it.
-Thank you again.

19:54.751 --> 19:56.792
Is it "debauchery"
or is it "debaukery?"

19:56.792 --> 20:00.667
[snoring]

20:00.667 --> 20:02.167
-Here.
-I'm not very good at this.

20:02.167 --> 20:05.876
-Yay!
-Okay, I think we're ready.

20:05.876 --> 20:08.834
Oh!

20:08.834 --> 20:11.334
I'm gonna go to bed,
good night, guys.

20:11.334 --> 20:13.167
I need to go to bed.

20:13.167 --> 20:17.083
Uno, dos, trÃ¨s!

20:17.083 --> 20:18.250
I love the wig!

20:18.250 --> 20:19.667
All right, are we
doing shots?

20:19.667 --> 20:22.834
-Yes.
-[snoring]

20:22.834 --> 20:23.834
No stripper?

20:23.834 --> 20:25.334
Is that what you'd like?

20:25.334 --> 20:27.125
-Tell the crew, yeah.
-Where the [bleep] is Tony?

20:27.125 --> 20:28.792
Deck crew, deck crew,

20:28.792 --> 20:31.375
the guests are asking
for exotic dancers.

20:31.375 --> 20:33.375
Ross, where can I find you?

20:33.375 --> 20:35.459
Hiding.

20:35.459 --> 20:40.667
Tony, Tony.

20:40.667 --> 20:42.334
Where is Tony?

20:42.334 --> 20:44.334
Hm?

20:44.334 --> 20:46.501
Come on, come on.

20:46.501 --> 20:48.959
It'll be...

20:48.959 --> 20:52.209
I feel awkward, but you know
how it is in yachting.

20:52.209 --> 20:54.125
Whatever the guests want,
they get it.

20:54.125 --> 20:56.083
So, ah.

20:56.083 --> 20:57.459
This is gonna be fun.

20:57.459 --> 20:59.042
No.

20:59.042 --> 21:00.751
Look at Peng.

21:00.751 --> 21:02.501
-Oh no.
-Ooh!

21:02.501 --> 21:04.918
Woo!

21:04.918 --> 21:07.667
Yeah, get it, boy!

21:07.667 --> 21:08.667
Oh, jeez.

21:08.667 --> 21:11.292
Being a stripper, dancing...
I don't dance.

21:11.292 --> 21:13.709
â™ª Drop it, lock it, get it

21:13.709 --> 21:14.876
-Oh, my God.
-Woo!

21:14.876 --> 21:17.375
I don't have salsa.

21:17.375 --> 21:19.042
I don't have Merengue.

21:19.042 --> 21:20.125
He don't know what to do!

21:20.125 --> 21:21.584
I have nothing.

21:21.584 --> 21:25.375
Yeah!

21:25.375 --> 21:26.751
Happy birthday, Peng!

21:26.751 --> 21:27.876
Happy birthday to all of us.

21:27.876 --> 21:29.501
Yay!

21:29.501 --> 21:30.876
There you go!

21:30.876 --> 21:31.876
That was amazing.

21:31.876 --> 21:33.125
One more little, like, ab flex.

21:33.125 --> 21:34.792
Like, huh!

21:34.792 --> 21:36.125
How do you have 10, though?
I didn't know there was 10.

21:36.125 --> 21:40.167
Bye, thank you, guys.

21:40.167 --> 21:42.417
Me and Camille try
to finish the salon.

21:42.417 --> 21:43.751
You decide to do
what you want to do

21:43.751 --> 21:44.792
between each other.

21:44.792 --> 21:46.250
Good night, thank you guys.

21:46.250 --> 21:48.459
Now you can clean up the
bar in the main salon,

21:48.459 --> 21:50.667
and you're good to go to bed.

21:50.667 --> 21:53.042
Okay.

21:53.042 --> 21:56.626
Yeah, right?

21:56.626 --> 22:07.667
Good night, you guys.

22:07.667 --> 22:09.584
That's why I don't let other
people do the ----ing job,

22:09.584 --> 22:12.042
because then it looks like
I ----ing did it half-assed.

22:12.042 --> 22:15.501
Of course, the lazy bitch
didn't do her job.

22:15.501 --> 22:18.334
Put it away so I don't have to
----ing tell you to put it away.

22:18.334 --> 22:20.959
Um, there's watermelon on
the counter of the bar.

22:20.959 --> 22:22.918
You have to put watermelon
in the fridge, girl,

22:22.918 --> 22:23.918
and stop playing with me.

22:23.918 --> 22:26.626
And then...

22:26.626 --> 22:27.876
no pouting on me...

22:27.876 --> 22:30.584
and then the...

22:30.584 --> 22:32.375
-That's fine.
-What do you mean?

22:32.375 --> 22:35.375
Those were just the things
that I saw walking around.

22:35.375 --> 22:42.792
-Okay. Good night.
-Good night.

22:42.792 --> 22:44.209
Coming up...

22:44.209 --> 22:46.000
Low-key, I know that
Camille likes Ben, but...

22:46.000 --> 22:47.083
Yeah.

22:47.083 --> 22:49.167
I'm still gonna flirt with him.

22:49.167 --> 22:50.751
I can't promise anything.

22:50.751 --> 22:50.751
I should have worn
underwear, though.

22:50.751 --> 23:00.167
Cheers.

23:00.167 --> 23:03.792
Ow. [bleep]

23:03.792 --> 23:17.375
Ah!

23:17.375 --> 23:26.375
[bleep]

23:26.375 --> 23:29.167
Ah!

23:29.167 --> 23:37.542
[bleep]

23:37.542 --> 23:40.167
Good morning, Peng.
Can I get you a coffee?

23:40.167 --> 23:49.000
Yeah, lovely, yeah.

23:49.000 --> 23:50.918
The weather in the Caribbean
is unpredictable,

23:50.918 --> 23:54.459
and St. Lucia, it's way down the
chain in the Windward Islands.

23:54.459 --> 23:56.375
They call them the Windward
Islands for a reason.

23:56.375 --> 23:58.876
Rolling around like
a Goddamn pinball

23:58.876 --> 24:00.667
in a slot machine.

24:00.667 --> 24:02.792
It makes docking
a lot more challenging.

24:02.792 --> 24:05.959
Goddamn it.

24:05.959 --> 24:09.375
Go ahead, Captain.

24:09.375 --> 24:15.292
Copy.

24:15.292 --> 24:16.876
-Yeah?
-We've got six of them.

24:16.876 --> 24:18.000
Any specials?

24:18.000 --> 24:19.375
-No specials.
-Yeah.

24:19.375 --> 24:23.125
Go ahead and start
taking their egg orders.

24:23.125 --> 24:24.501
What the [bleep]?

24:24.501 --> 24:25.459
Any eggs this morning?

24:25.459 --> 24:27.167
-Can I do scrambled?
-You can indeed, yeah.

24:27.167 --> 24:28.709
I'll do scrambled.

24:28.709 --> 24:30.709
I'll have an omelette,
mushroom, spinach, and ham.

24:30.709 --> 24:31.959
Amazing.

24:31.959 --> 24:34.167
-Mr. Olender.
-G
o ahead, Captain.

24:34.167 --> 24:36.751
I just wanna make sure that
I have a white shirt.

24:36.751 --> 24:37.959
Have you not got
a white shirt?

24:37.959 --> 24:39.375
-That would be a negative.
-Copy.

24:39.375 --> 24:41.334
I walked into the room and
he's laying there

24:41.334 --> 24:42.918
completely face-down,
like, naked.

24:42.918 --> 24:44.667
I was, like, is that how he...

24:44.667 --> 24:45.959
that's how he went to bed?

24:45.959 --> 24:47.584
Very quickly, Captain Lee,
his laundry...

24:47.584 --> 24:49.792
only his underwear
gets put in the dryer,

24:49.792 --> 24:52.709
the rest all hang-dry.

24:52.709 --> 24:53.792
Is that all you got?

24:53.792 --> 24:54.959
They better get a more rolly,

24:54.959 --> 24:58.375
more ----ed-up anchorage
next time.

24:58.375 --> 25:01.375
What?
You're insane.

25:01.375 --> 25:06.000
Ah, okay.

25:06.000 --> 25:08.334
-You had eggs, didn't you?
-Just eggs.

25:08.334 --> 25:09.834
-I got the...
-You got the ham, didn't you?

25:09.834 --> 25:10.876
I got... no.

25:10.876 --> 25:11.918
My bad, guys.

25:11.918 --> 25:13.042
This is amazing.

25:13.042 --> 25:14.209
Hi, Captain.

25:14.209 --> 25:17.584
Yes.

25:17.584 --> 25:18.751
Something white?

25:18.751 --> 25:20.083
There's that.

25:20.083 --> 25:23.584
I brought you some pantaloons.

25:23.584 --> 25:25.083
Is that spicy?

25:25.083 --> 25:26.959
You can do really spicy food,
though, can't you?

25:26.959 --> 25:28.751
I can, but this is extreme.

25:28.751 --> 25:30.626
You wanna try it?

25:30.626 --> 25:34.000
No!

25:34.000 --> 25:35.375
How was work?

25:35.375 --> 25:37.709
Oh, good, yay!

25:37.709 --> 25:39.792
Things are going
exceedingly well.

25:39.792 --> 25:43.667
All right, well, I'm gonna
get something to eat.

25:43.667 --> 25:44.792
Thanks Mom.

25:44.792 --> 25:46.542
All right, love you, bye.

25:46.542 --> 25:47.876
She sounds adorable.

25:47.876 --> 25:49.167
Oh, my mom?
Mm-hmm.

25:49.167 --> 25:50.250
Yeah, she's cutie.

25:50.250 --> 25:51.918
-What's her name?
-Gina.

25:51.918 --> 25:54.167
I'm definitely closest with her.

25:54.167 --> 25:55.834
Are your parents together?

25:55.834 --> 25:57.417
No, they've been divorced
since before I could remember.

25:57.417 --> 25:59.792
Really? Are you friends
with your dad, though?

25:59.792 --> 26:02.417
Uh... I lived with my dad.

26:02.417 --> 26:03.250
Mm-hmm.

26:03.250 --> 26:04.250
But we're not friends.

26:04.250 --> 26:05.584
He's pretty negative.

26:05.584 --> 26:07.501
He had primary custody
and she had, like...

26:07.501 --> 26:08.375
Okay.

26:08.375 --> 26:10.584
...come get us on
the weekends type.

26:10.584 --> 26:14.375
My dad, he's really strict,
very devout Christian.

26:14.375 --> 26:16.959
When you have a
controlling parent,

26:16.959 --> 26:19.751
I became really, really
soft and submissive,

26:19.751 --> 26:21.083
and everything hurts.

26:21.083 --> 26:23.375
Like, my dad is just,
like, really mean,

26:23.375 --> 26:25.626
and, like, custody was,
like, hard on her.

26:25.626 --> 26:27.876
Like, just always going
to court and stuff.

26:27.876 --> 26:29.584
So, she kinda fell back.

26:29.584 --> 26:30.250
She left a lot.

26:30.250 --> 26:31.959
My mom, though, I love my mom.

26:31.959 --> 26:33.667
But yeah, she was very
inconsistent with us.

26:33.667 --> 26:36.626
She left for work one time,
she just, like...

26:36.626 --> 26:38.959
was, like, "I'll see you guys
tomorrow," and dropped us off,

26:38.959 --> 26:41.292
and then we didn't see her for,
like, two and a half years.

26:41.292 --> 26:43.542
It just... it's horrible.

26:43.542 --> 26:45.959
Like, being
constantly disrespected,

26:45.959 --> 26:48.000
as a kid, like,
you automatically forgive it

26:48.000 --> 26:49.167
because it's, like,
your parents.

26:49.167 --> 26:51.292
But, I don't know, it's hard.

26:51.292 --> 26:54.250
And just whenever somebody
is talking down to me

26:54.250 --> 26:56.542
or disrespecting me,
I feel like

26:56.542 --> 26:58.250
because I've never stood up
for myself,

26:58.250 --> 27:04.626
it's very, very important
for me to do that now.

27:04.626 --> 27:06.501
Yeah, I'm on that now, Captain.

27:06.501 --> 27:09.167
All righty, guys.

27:09.167 --> 27:11.083
Wow, this wind
is not gonna help us.

27:11.083 --> 27:12.083
Hello, Captain.

27:12.083 --> 27:13.334
We have an issue, sir.

27:13.334 --> 27:16.375
Look at me.

27:16.375 --> 27:17.250
Shrunk?

27:17.250 --> 27:18.834
Yeah, okay.
I'll get you anther one.

27:18.834 --> 27:20.751
How about it's not mine?

27:20.751 --> 27:22.042
Oh, that's not ideal, is it?

27:22.042 --> 27:23.584
That's weird.

27:23.584 --> 27:24.751
Comical, huh?

27:24.751 --> 27:27.209
Christ, I look like a pork
sandwich at a Jewish picnic.

27:27.209 --> 27:28.751
You know what,
I've seen you look better.

27:28.751 --> 27:29.918
I can promise you
that'll never happen again.

27:29.918 --> 27:31.292
I would be delighted.

27:31.292 --> 27:32.959
-Thank you, sir.
-Thank you.

27:32.959 --> 27:34.042
[laughing]

27:34.042 --> 27:35.375
Look, I did it!

27:35.375 --> 27:38.375
Look at me,
I'm gonna do it again.

27:38.375 --> 27:39.959
Camille, Captain Lee's
got the wrong shirt on.

27:39.959 --> 27:41.918
So, we're gonna need
to find his large.

27:41.918 --> 27:43.751
Oh my God.
I didn't see a large.

27:43.751 --> 27:45.167
No large.

27:45.167 --> 27:46.209
That's medium.

27:46.209 --> 27:47.834
Yeah, there's no larges in here.

27:47.834 --> 27:49.167
Where else could it be?

27:49.167 --> 27:50.626
-In his room.
-Okay.

27:50.626 --> 27:52.834
So, everyone, let's
just pack our bags

27:52.834 --> 27:53.834
and put them by their doors.

27:53.834 --> 27:54.959
Well, no, they do that.

27:54.959 --> 27:55.959
Oh, okay.

27:55.959 --> 27:58.375
Captain, I'm so sorry.

27:58.375 --> 28:00.918
We're getting this laundry
system figured out.

28:00.918 --> 28:02.250
We don't have a...

28:02.250 --> 28:06.417
we don't have a large
down there at all.

28:06.417 --> 28:08.584
You did?

28:08.584 --> 28:09.792
Yes, sir.

28:09.792 --> 28:12.501
It's right here.

28:12.501 --> 28:17.167
Okay.

28:17.167 --> 28:18.959
Thank you, Captain.
Sorry about that.

28:18.959 --> 28:20.626
It's okay.

28:20.626 --> 28:23.584
I'm gonna show you guys how
this all operates for anchoring,

28:23.584 --> 28:26.626
and we're just going to be
looking at how this works.

28:26.626 --> 28:27.959
So, this goes both ways, right?

28:27.959 --> 28:30.584
With yachting.

28:30.584 --> 28:31.834
It's too easy!

28:31.834 --> 28:35.792
With regards to my deck team,
great attitudes, love them all.

28:35.792 --> 28:38.375
But Tony is pretty green.

28:38.375 --> 28:40.375
At the moment, the load
is all on me,

28:40.375 --> 28:43.375
and I hope to spread that
load amongst my deck crew.

28:43.375 --> 28:47.751
My work load.

28:47.751 --> 28:51.125
Sorry.

28:51.125 --> 28:53.375
See some clockwise.

28:53.375 --> 28:55.751
-Hey.
-Okay, good.

28:55.751 --> 28:57.959
Well, let's saddle up and
get the hell outta here.

28:57.959 --> 28:59.375
-Ready to haul?
-Yeah, start hauling.

28:59.375 --> 29:05.792
Hauling.

29:05.792 --> 29:06.792
Very good.

29:06.792 --> 29:15.209
Let's get outta here.

29:15.209 --> 29:17.584
Still looks a little
shtuppy, doesn't it?

29:17.584 --> 29:19.792
Today is one of those days
where I'm as nervous

29:19.792 --> 29:22.417
as a whore in a front-row pew
at church.

29:22.417 --> 29:23.959
We don't wanna lose
the whole line,

29:23.959 --> 29:25.584
so I want you to have
the hold onto.

29:25.584 --> 29:27.584
We've got a mountain here,
got a mountain here,

29:27.584 --> 29:30.292
and we've got this pass where
the wind funnels through.

29:30.292 --> 29:31.959
We also have
a lot of freeboard...

29:31.959 --> 29:34.167
that's surface above the water.

29:34.167 --> 29:35.834
We're just a big sail.

29:35.834 --> 29:38.834
It's a tricky docking,
but you get paid the big bucks

29:38.834 --> 29:43.626
to make the hard calls.

29:43.626 --> 29:45.000
Damn it.

29:45.000 --> 29:46.375
All right, and if you
could hold it there.

29:46.375 --> 29:48.167
-Aren't we close?
-It's just there.

29:48.167 --> 29:50.584
-Based on the situation?
-I don't know the situation.

29:50.584 --> 29:56.959
What is happening?

29:56.959 --> 29:58.334
Cap, Cap, that is
port side anchor

29:58.334 --> 30:02.501
ready for emergency drop.

30:02.501 --> 30:07.501
Goddamn it!

30:07.501 --> 30:09.209
Goddamn it!

30:09.209 --> 30:11.542
Twenty-seven knots.
That's not good.

30:11.542 --> 30:12.751
It's just so windy.

30:12.751 --> 30:14.167
It smells so good up here.

30:14.167 --> 30:16.459
All right, and if you
could hold it there...

30:16.459 --> 30:17.584
Ah!

30:17.584 --> 30:21.167
True wind speed, 27 knots.

30:21.167 --> 30:24.000
Woo!

30:24.000 --> 30:25.751
Ross, Camille.

30:25.751 --> 30:33.000
Will you be needing my
assistance on deck for docking?

30:33.000 --> 30:34.751
Copy, thank you so much.

30:34.751 --> 30:36.626
-Ben, you good?
-Yeah.

30:36.626 --> 30:38.584
Deck crew, deck crew,
whenever you can break free,

30:38.584 --> 30:41.042
I need all of you up
into the wheelhouse.

30:41.042 --> 30:42.250
Copy that.

30:42.250 --> 30:45.083
Mother Nature is
one badass bitch.

30:45.083 --> 30:47.292
Okay, wind inside's too extreme.

30:47.292 --> 30:49.375
Twenty-seven knots,
we're not gonna go in.

30:49.375 --> 30:51.584
I'll pick a spot out here,
we'll drop the hook,

30:51.584 --> 30:56.083
get the guests to disembark from
here, and ferry their asses in.

30:56.083 --> 30:57.626
We got a 200-foot boat.

30:57.626 --> 30:59.792
That's a lot of money
to spend if you [bleep] up.

30:59.792 --> 31:01.584
Yeah, we'll get in position,
thank you.

31:01.584 --> 31:02.667
Thank you.

31:02.667 --> 31:04.417
Alissa, Hayley, and Camille,

31:04.417 --> 31:06.375
if you'd like to get into your
whites, please, for departure.

31:06.375 --> 31:07.083
Copy that.

31:07.083 --> 31:13.083
Ugh, I forgot my ----ing belt.

31:13.083 --> 31:15.000
Blue is your color,
it looks really good.

31:15.000 --> 31:16.209
Thanks.

31:16.209 --> 31:21.584
Ross, let's drop the hook.

31:21.584 --> 31:23.000
Good job.

31:23.000 --> 31:24.584
-Copy.
-Why are we anchoring?

31:24.584 --> 31:28.709
We're not going in.
We have to drop the tender.

31:28.709 --> 31:29.792
I know, right?

31:29.792 --> 31:31.083
I was so excited.

31:31.083 --> 31:33.000
Hello, Captain.
Do we have any form of ETA?

31:33.000 --> 31:34.792
We have to launch the tender,

31:34.792 --> 31:38.209
it's gonna go luggage first,
and then we'll do our goodbyes.

31:38.209 --> 31:42.042
Great, I'll get that in motion.

31:42.042 --> 31:43.959
Oh, oh, oh.
Jiggy, jiggy.

31:43.959 --> 31:45.584
Fenders are on the port side.

31:45.584 --> 31:48.292
Coming out.

31:48.292 --> 31:49.959
Guess I'm heading out.

31:49.959 --> 31:51.876
I don't know where you want
me to put all your stuff.

31:51.876 --> 31:53.709
Guys, I might need help.

31:53.709 --> 31:57.375
I think I came with, like,
more stuff than I arrived with.

31:57.375 --> 31:59.042
Katie coming with, or
she's gonna jump off?

31:59.042 --> 32:00.709
-No, she's gonna jump off.
-All right.

32:00.709 --> 32:02.292
If you just stay at
the controls now, Ben.

32:02.292 --> 32:03.167
Copy.

32:03.167 --> 32:05.125
I've got a little
system going here.

32:05.125 --> 32:06.334
It's the two-step jump.

32:06.334 --> 32:08.250
I wish I was in that bag.

32:08.250 --> 32:12.626
I need everyone on the aft deck
in five minutes in your whites.

32:12.626 --> 32:16.584
Copy.

32:16.584 --> 32:17.626
How are you?

32:17.626 --> 32:19.167
We were just relaxing.

32:19.167 --> 32:20.417
How are you feeling?
Are you doing... are you good?

32:20.417 --> 32:21.709
-Good, yeah.
-Should we take shots?

32:21.709 --> 32:22.751
You ready for a shot?

32:22.751 --> 32:24.709
-Yeah, are you?
-No.

32:24.709 --> 32:26.918
Captain, are you upset that
you don't have a white shirt?

32:26.918 --> 32:33.501
There would be no doubt
in your mind if I were.

32:33.501 --> 32:34.459
No doubt in my mind.

32:34.459 --> 32:37.751
Oh, hey, thank you so much,
appreciate you.

32:37.751 --> 32:38.751
I'm gonna miss you so much.

32:38.751 --> 32:40.000
You're a dream.

32:40.000 --> 32:41.000
Thank you...
just full of surprises.

32:41.000 --> 32:42.000
You are full of surprises.

32:42.000 --> 32:43.375
Thank you again.

32:43.375 --> 32:45.209
Service-wise, everything was
great except

32:45.209 --> 32:49.792
for we couldn't figure out where
the soaps were and toilet paper.

32:49.792 --> 32:53.751
Then you brought all of the
alcohol, and we like to drink.

32:53.751 --> 32:56.584
You woke up and you were,
like, off-shift, or whatever.

32:56.584 --> 32:58.167
Like, I felt so bad.

32:58.167 --> 32:59.417
They were like, "Whatever."

32:59.417 --> 33:00.959
I felt so bad.

33:00.959 --> 33:02.250
It was a new experience
for me too.

33:02.250 --> 33:04.000
Thank you guys so much.

33:04.000 --> 33:05.000
This is for you guys.

33:05.000 --> 33:06.083
Thank you.

33:06.083 --> 33:07.709
I'm going with them.

33:07.709 --> 33:09.417
Okay, thank you so much.

33:09.417 --> 33:10.542
Thank you again.

33:10.542 --> 33:13.042
That is trouble on the ----ing
water, right there.

33:13.042 --> 33:15.417
Oh, that's the definition
of it, Captain.

33:15.417 --> 33:17.417
Woo!

33:17.417 --> 33:19.292
We're gonna be on
the hook for a bit.

33:19.292 --> 33:20.501
Let's get into our blues,

33:20.501 --> 33:22.626
and I will meet with all
of you shortly.

33:22.626 --> 33:24.501
-Thanks, Captain.
-Thank you, thank you.

33:24.501 --> 33:27.083
Guys, I'm so pleased we had
that little trip with them.

33:27.083 --> 33:28.375
Yeah, I think...

33:28.375 --> 33:33.542
Woo!

33:33.542 --> 33:35.209
Oh, go, bitch!

33:35.209 --> 33:37.083
That made it, that show
we put on last night.

33:37.083 --> 33:38.375
Who did what?

33:38.375 --> 33:41.209
I missed it, I missed abs,
apparently.

33:41.209 --> 33:43.501
Everybody has abs on
this boat, like...

33:43.501 --> 33:47.167
do you have abs?

33:47.167 --> 33:48.375
Let's stop being inappropriate.

33:48.375 --> 33:51.083
-No!
-This is a workplace, everybody.

33:51.083 --> 33:53.250
Attention, all crew,

33:53.250 --> 33:55.626
there'll be a meeting in the sky
lounge in five minutes.

33:55.626 --> 33:56.709
Copy, Captain.

33:56.709 --> 33:58.584
Are we going up?

33:58.584 --> 33:59.459
Mr. Olender.

33:59.459 --> 34:01.334
Let's see it,
I wanna see the money!

34:01.334 --> 34:03.167
First one out of the way...

34:03.167 --> 34:05.042
they loved all of
the crew involvement.

34:05.042 --> 34:06.959
Thank you for going
above and beyond.

34:06.959 --> 34:09.918
Total tip amount was $25,000.

34:09.918 --> 34:11.125
I'm gonna cry, oh!

34:11.125 --> 34:13.083
Twenty-one hundred
dollars apiece...

34:13.083 --> 34:14.709
that's a pretty healthy start.

34:14.709 --> 34:16.459
Thank you.
Holy sh--!

34:16.459 --> 34:20.334
I'm already envisioning
the Louis Vuitton handbag

34:20.334 --> 34:23.501
I'm gonna get in the airport
on the way home.

34:23.501 --> 34:24.792
Thank you.

34:24.792 --> 34:25.834
-Carry on.
-Thank you!

34:25.834 --> 34:27.417
Thank you.

34:27.417 --> 34:29.542
Damn, that got some smiles
on some faces, didn't it?

34:29.542 --> 34:33.083
-Brilliant, let's go.
-Okay, thank you.

34:33.083 --> 34:34.584
Where are the boys,
in the front?

34:34.584 --> 34:37.209
Yeah, I'm really hoping
we might get close to good

34:37.209 --> 34:39.959
by the time the sun drops
into the ocean.

34:39.959 --> 34:41.000
I know.

34:41.000 --> 34:42.542
You gonna come out tonight?

34:42.542 --> 34:44.167
Yeah, man, I'm gonna go
and see what's cracking.

34:44.167 --> 34:45.792
It'll be fun to see
everyone out of work.

34:45.792 --> 34:47.042
-When we go out tonight...
-Yeah.

34:47.042 --> 34:48.709
If we can be wheeled around.

34:48.709 --> 34:49.959
"Wheeled around?" Like...

34:49.959 --> 34:51.083
Yeah, so we didn't have
to walk anywhere

34:51.083 --> 34:52.375
so our feet would
get a nice rest.

34:52.375 --> 34:53.959
-That would be lovely.
-Imagine?

34:53.959 --> 34:56.083
What do you think about the
girls on board, any your style?

34:56.083 --> 34:57.959
I think they all are
very beautiful girls,

34:57.959 --> 34:59.459
but I'm not vibing, you know?

34:59.459 --> 35:01.667
Like, I'm not really
in the mood, you know?

35:01.667 --> 35:03.125
No, I think they're
pretty cool, actually.

35:03.125 --> 35:04.292
I mean, of course.

35:04.292 --> 35:05.959
Like, I think Camille's...

35:05.959 --> 35:06.959
I like Camille.

35:06.959 --> 35:08.209
This all looks very special.

35:08.209 --> 35:09.959
I don't wanna [bleep] it up.

35:09.959 --> 35:11.417
I don't know, there's something
about her eyes that are just,

35:11.417 --> 35:12.334
like ----ing...

35:12.334 --> 35:14.501
Yeah, she does...
has beautiful eyes.

35:14.501 --> 35:16.751
Yeah, yeah.

35:16.751 --> 35:17.751
Alissa?

35:17.751 --> 35:19.042
Yeah? She...

35:19.042 --> 35:20.417
I wasn't keen on her
at the start,

35:20.417 --> 35:22.167
but she's, like,
I've warmed up to her.

35:22.167 --> 35:23.417
I like her, she's pretty cool.

35:23.417 --> 35:25.167
-When are we leaving?
-Seven-thirty.

35:25.167 --> 35:30.667
Oh, darling.

35:30.667 --> 35:31.792
We've done the foredeck.

35:31.792 --> 35:35.709
Bloody lovely, let's pack it up.

35:35.709 --> 35:40.959
Interior, interior...

35:40.959 --> 35:47.292
-Ah!
-Oh sh--, sorry.

35:47.292 --> 35:50.209
He thinks I'm sweet?
I am sweet.

35:50.209 --> 35:52.792
Tonight I'm thinking
I really wanna get

35:52.792 --> 35:54.125
to know Ben a little more.

35:54.125 --> 35:55.250
I think he's a little shy.

35:55.250 --> 35:57.083
Booyah.
Beautiful.

35:57.083 --> 35:58.792
And so, I want to, like,

35:58.792 --> 36:03.125
open up a little bit
so that he can come in.

36:03.125 --> 36:05.125
We'll do spice tonight.

36:05.125 --> 36:07.375
Low-key, I know that
Camille likes Ben,

36:07.375 --> 36:10.834
but she's been a bitch to me, so
I'm still gonna flirt with him.

36:10.834 --> 36:12.959
We've to get this
blow-dryer thing figured out.

36:12.959 --> 36:15.959
I don't owe anyone anything,
especially not her.

36:15.959 --> 36:18.417
I am not wearing
any underwear tonight.

36:18.417 --> 36:18.417
[laughing]

36:18.417 --> 36:23.167
Goddamn it!

36:23.167 --> 36:24.959
That looks great.

36:24.959 --> 36:26.417
I'm gonna be dry-humping
your leg.

36:26.417 --> 36:27.375
Are you horny?

36:27.375 --> 36:31.459
Yeah, I could definitely
go [bleep] a shag.

36:31.459 --> 36:33.918
Woop, woop,
Tony, Tony, Tony.

36:33.918 --> 36:35.459
You washed your hair.

36:35.459 --> 36:36.584
Yeah.

36:36.584 --> 36:38.125
-Let's get it.
-Let's go.

36:38.125 --> 36:40.834
We deserve it.

36:40.834 --> 36:42.501
Oh, my God, we're in
the middle of the ocean.

36:42.501 --> 36:45.292
Woo!

36:45.292 --> 36:47.125
Are we, like,
getting drunk drinking?

36:47.125 --> 36:51.459
What's the plan?

36:51.459 --> 36:54.876
Tequila.

36:54.876 --> 36:56.792
Calamari.

36:56.792 --> 36:58.918
Can I get a piÃ±a colada?

36:58.918 --> 37:00.083
My safety?

37:00.083 --> 37:08.667
-Yeah.
-Why?

37:08.667 --> 37:09.667
I wanna say something.

37:09.667 --> 37:10.709
We have alcohol.

37:10.709 --> 37:12.334
I just wanna say we are all
the way down here,

37:12.334 --> 37:13.918
the farthest south
I've ever been,

37:13.918 --> 37:17.834
and I just wanna say that I hope
we all have a great season,

37:17.834 --> 37:19.209
and we all stay safe.

37:19.209 --> 37:22.000
And I hope we get ----ing
slammed tonight,

37:22.000 --> 37:25.751
because we had a really good
charter, thanks to everybody.

37:25.751 --> 37:27.375
-Woo!
-Yeah!

37:27.375 --> 37:32.751
Ready.

37:32.751 --> 37:35.876
I like Ross, I think he's cute.

37:35.876 --> 37:37.292
Yeah.

37:37.292 --> 37:38.959
So, where have you been,
like, before you got on this...

37:38.959 --> 37:39.959
on St. David?

37:39.959 --> 37:42.626
I used to live in France.

37:42.626 --> 37:43.959
Ah!

37:43.959 --> 37:45.125
-What'd you get?
-I got a piÃ±a colada.

37:45.125 --> 37:46.626
Frozen or on the rocks?

37:46.626 --> 37:48.834
I've got no idea.

37:48.834 --> 37:49.834
I love that.

37:49.834 --> 37:51.000
I love surprises.

37:51.000 --> 37:54.250
No shagging anyone tonight.

37:54.250 --> 37:56.918
I should have
worn underwear, though.

37:56.918 --> 37:59.792
We've got a live soap opera
on board at the moment.

37:59.792 --> 38:02.250
As uncomfortable as
this situation is,

38:02.250 --> 38:05.250
I'm still enjoying watching it.

38:05.250 --> 38:26.501
Like, who am I gonna
put my money on?

38:26.501 --> 38:41.250
Really?

38:41.250 --> 38:42.792
Wait, can I do something?

38:42.792 --> 38:49.125
Do whatever you need to do.

38:49.125 --> 38:53.501
I hope not.

38:53.501 --> 38:54.584
Sluts.

38:54.584 --> 39:01.375
No.

39:01.375 --> 39:03.292
I dated a big-deal quarterback.

39:03.292 --> 39:07.042
We fell in love, and then
he cheated on me many times.

39:07.042 --> 39:09.792
I was depressed
and I had anxiety,

39:09.792 --> 39:11.459
and I was kind of
a joke at that point.

39:11.459 --> 39:12.459
Like, I just wanted
to get away.

39:12.459 --> 39:14.125
I wanted no one to know me.

39:14.125 --> 39:16.501
And I think that that's what
a lot of people do in yachting,

39:16.501 --> 39:18.792
they get away from their demons.

39:18.792 --> 39:21.125
This is our job,
it makes no ----ing sense.

39:21.125 --> 39:23.083
-But we do it anyway.
-But we do it anyway.

39:23.083 --> 39:24.459
The crispy calamari.

39:24.459 --> 39:25.167
Oh, yes!

39:25.167 --> 39:51.792
Ooh, that looks really yummy.

39:51.792 --> 39:52.959
Now I'm golden.

39:52.959 --> 39:57.918
-Rachel, no!
-I've got it.

39:57.918 --> 39:58.959
Let's go!

39:58.959 --> 40:03.959
All right, is that everybody?

40:03.959 --> 40:08.501
Oh, no!

40:08.501 --> 40:10.792
Drinks? Drinks?

40:10.792 --> 40:18.792
I thought we left jorts alone,
like, a long time ago.

40:18.792 --> 40:25.959
Okay, I'm changing.

40:25.959 --> 40:27.167
Ah!

40:27.167 --> 40:28.375
Are you wearing a Speedo?

40:28.375 --> 40:29.959
Real Australian.

40:29.959 --> 40:32.167
Interior, we're up at
8:00 tomorrow, by the way.

40:32.167 --> 40:37.918
Sorry, what was that?

40:37.918 --> 40:38.959
Okay.

40:38.959 --> 40:40.792
My boss is the best.

40:40.792 --> 40:42.501
-Should we take it upstairs?
-Let's go.

40:42.501 --> 40:43.792
We're getting in
your hot tub.

40:43.792 --> 40:45.083
Oh, my God, it's cold?

40:45.083 --> 40:46.459
I'm not getting in a
cold hot tub.

40:46.459 --> 40:47.417
Back down we go.

40:47.417 --> 40:49.000
I really wanted, like,
a hot, like, moment.

40:49.000 --> 40:55.459
We can just chill in the bar.

40:55.459 --> 40:56.167
Oh, no.

40:56.167 --> 40:57.959
I will never chase after a man.

40:57.959 --> 41:00.959
Camille's a chaser, I'm not.

41:00.959 --> 41:03.209
When you don't have it up here,
you gotta use something,

41:03.209 --> 41:04.792
and Camille uses her ass.

41:04.792 --> 41:06.125
Oh, no.

41:06.125 --> 41:08.667
Woo!
Hey!

41:08.667 --> 41:11.292
Here we go!

41:11.292 --> 41:12.667
Hold on, I can't watch this.

41:12.667 --> 41:14.000
We're getting more
than we paid for.

41:14.000 --> 41:15.584
Hey!

41:15.584 --> 41:17.959
Never have I ever,
never would I ever.

41:17.959 --> 41:19.959
Like, just no.

41:19.959 --> 41:21.167
Did you enjoy that?

41:21.167 --> 41:25.751
And it just lowers my value.

41:25.751 --> 41:28.584
Do you wanna go down?

41:28.584 --> 41:45.083
[hiccups]

41:45.083 --> 41:49.083
Ah, what the [bleep]?

41:49.083 --> 41:50.501
[bleep] me.

41:50.501 --> 41:52.501
This morning, everything's numb.

41:52.501 --> 41:56.334
I'm not progressing
at a rate I anticipated.

41:56.334 --> 41:58.792
The pain's getting worse,
not better.

41:58.792 --> 42:00.292
There we go.

42:00.292 --> 42:02.959
I can barely ----ing stand up.

42:02.959 --> 42:05.125
In fact, I can't stand up.

42:05.125 --> 42:08.959
Ah, mother----er.

42:08.959 --> 42:10.459
Next, on "Below Deck"...

42:10.459 --> 42:12.501
We've got Michelle and
her girlfriends,

42:12.501 --> 42:14.459
and they're all medical doctors.

42:14.459 --> 42:17.167
We're gonna try and avoid taking
glassware on any of the decks.

42:17.167 --> 42:19.083
I don't want anyone
getting hurt,

42:19.083 --> 42:20.417
even though you're nurses
and I'm pretty sure you can...

42:20.417 --> 42:21.626
-Doctors.
-...deal with it.

42:21.626 --> 42:23.792
Doctors.

42:23.792 --> 42:25.334
This is awkward.

42:25.334 --> 42:27.167
-Did you see Katie?
-I haven't seen her.

42:27.167 --> 42:29.167
I'm gonna go
and wake up Katie.

42:29.167 --> 42:30.834
You need to get on
deck right now.

42:30.834 --> 42:32.167
-Okay.
-Sh--.

42:32.167 --> 42:33.918
-...To the side.
-Wait, wait, hold on, hold on.

42:33.918 --> 42:35.375
Babe, what are you doing?

42:35.375 --> 42:36.959
I thought pulling your hair
would be a good idea.

42:36.959 --> 42:39.792
She pulled the wig
and it just...

42:39.792 --> 42:40.792
That's hellish.

42:40.792 --> 42:42.042
If you don't check her,

42:42.042 --> 42:43.626
I'm gonna [bleep]
up your friend.

42:43.626 --> 42:46.959
See this space where more
bottles can go, right here...

42:46.959 --> 42:49.584
If you have so much time to walk
around and do these checks,

42:49.584 --> 42:51.250
maybe you could grab it.

42:51.250 --> 42:53.876
There's no regard for
the amount of work I'm doing.

42:53.876 --> 42:55.250
I need that tequila because

42:55.250 --> 42:56.792
I'm gonna pack up for
the beach picnic.

42:56.792 --> 42:58.667
I'm on deck right now.
You're not my boss.

42:58.667 --> 43:02.667
That's the lazy sh--
I'm talking about.
