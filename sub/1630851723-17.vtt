WEBVTT

01:18.546 --> 01:21.182
What was the protocol,
Kosta?

01:21.315 --> 01:22.883
Raymond?

01:23.016 --> 01:24.652
How?

01:24.785 --> 01:27.688
The last time I saw you,
you said you were going to
meet your fate.

01:27.821 --> 01:29.823
You may very well
be about to meet yours.

01:30.858 --> 01:32.193
I don't understand.

01:32.326 --> 01:33.594
Neither do I.

01:33.727 --> 01:35.129
Which is why I'm here.

01:36.164 --> 01:36.897
The plan.

01:37.798 --> 01:39.900
I want to hear
from your lips

01:40.033 --> 01:41.702
how the plan
was supposed to work.

01:47.441 --> 01:50.344
To begin with?
You were supposed to die.

01:50.478 --> 01:53.080
Then Elizabeth would be given
specific instructions

01:53.214 --> 01:54.415
on how to
make her way here.

01:54.548 --> 01:55.549
I would be waiting.

01:56.584 --> 01:58.252
Elizabeth is dead.

01:58.386 --> 02:00.788
For several years now.

02:00.921 --> 02:03.591
You didn't think something was
wrong when she
never showed up?

02:03.724 --> 02:05.693
Well, you never told me
how long to wait.

02:05.826 --> 02:07.228
So I kept
the lanterns burning.

02:07.761 --> 02:08.729
Mm.

02:10.030 --> 02:13.767
The noble lighthouse keeper
at the end of the world.

02:13.901 --> 02:16.770
It would be poetic, if you
hadn't betrayed my trust.

02:16.904 --> 02:17.938
I would never.

02:19.207 --> 02:20.974
The recordings
for Elizabeth.

02:21.108 --> 02:22.910
You saw me put them
inside the safe.

02:23.043 --> 02:25.078
Yes. In the screening room.

02:25.213 --> 02:26.447
No one has
been in there since.

02:30.918 --> 02:33.587
Then why did I find these
on the other side
of the world?

02:34.388 --> 02:35.523
But how?

02:37.057 --> 02:39.293
Bocce balls.
I figure when in Rome.

02:40.361 --> 02:41.529
We're in Montenegro.

02:41.662 --> 02:43.163
Sciatica's acting up.

02:43.297 --> 02:45.466
Haven't been
in this much pain
since I threw out my back

02:45.599 --> 02:48.569
dancing at a sock hop in 1974.

02:48.702 --> 02:50.404
Who is that?
That's your fate.

02:50.538 --> 02:52.773
He and his bocce balls
are here

02:52.906 --> 02:54.308
to find out
what really happened.

02:56.076 --> 02:58.612
I hope you slept well, Kosta.
It's going to be a long day.

03:10.758 --> 03:12.192
Good morning, Director.

03:14.127 --> 03:15.296
Good morning, Director, sir.

03:15.429 --> 03:17.164
Um...

03:17.298 --> 03:18.266
I'm Agent Mojtabai.

03:19.132 --> 03:19.933
I'm-- I'm Mr. Mojta--

03:20.067 --> 03:21.335
No. Okay.

03:21.469 --> 03:23.537
I'm Aram.

03:23.671 --> 03:26.173
How did I forget
how to do this?

03:26.307 --> 03:29.142
I was shocked to see
your name on my phone sheet.

03:29.277 --> 03:30.210
How've you been?

03:30.344 --> 03:32.012
Um... I've been better.

03:33.581 --> 03:36.350
I forgot.
You actually do honesty.

03:36.484 --> 03:38.552
Well, the last couple months
haven't been the best.

03:38.686 --> 03:40.421
Things didn't quite work out
at the Bureau.

03:40.554 --> 03:42.256
Oh, I'm sorry to hear it.

03:42.390 --> 03:44.157
The task force I was on
got shut down

03:44.292 --> 03:46.727
because of the death
of a colleague, and, um...

03:46.860 --> 03:50.298
I just couldn't find
my passion in it anymore.

03:50.431 --> 03:53.534
I meant I'm sorry
to hear you say it to me.

03:53.667 --> 03:55.035
You may not remember,

03:55.168 --> 03:57.638
but commiseration's
not my strong suit.

03:57.771 --> 03:59.740
I mean,
if we're being honest.
Oh, I remember.

03:59.873 --> 04:03.210
In fact, Nick, uh, that--
that's why I'm here.

04:03.344 --> 04:07.114
Because what I remember
is that you are
completely selfish.

04:08.582 --> 04:09.583
And this...

04:11.352 --> 04:14.054
This is
a million-dollar idea.

04:17.391 --> 04:20.060
Okay. I'm interested.

04:20.193 --> 04:22.763
So, you know how most security
systems are defensive, right?

04:22.896 --> 04:24.298
They detect a threat
and shut it down.

04:24.432 --> 04:28.402
Well, this software--
this software is offensive.

04:28.536 --> 04:30.003
When it detects an intrusion,

04:30.137 --> 04:33.607
it activates its own
built-in Trojan rootkit
to attack the intruder.

04:33.741 --> 04:35.576
It then throws out
colossal floods

04:35.709 --> 04:37.845
of junk traffic
to clog them up

04:37.978 --> 04:39.713
while it eviscerates
their operating system
in the process.

04:41.181 --> 04:42.750
That is not
a million-dollar idea.

04:46.587 --> 04:47.888
It's a billion-dollar one.

04:49.490 --> 04:50.891
This won't just
protect people.

04:51.024 --> 04:52.793
It will actively
discourage black hats.

04:54.562 --> 04:56.096
It'll revolutionize
tech security.

04:56.229 --> 04:58.499
Right?
That is what I was going for,

04:58.632 --> 05:02.503
but I have no idea how to
turn my idea into a business,
which is why I'm here.

05:02.636 --> 05:05.138
Of course, um, if, uh--
if you're too busy

05:05.272 --> 05:07.174
or, you know, need, um,
some time to think it over--

05:07.307 --> 05:09.743
I am too busy,
and I've already
thought about it.

05:09.877 --> 05:11.645
I'm in.

05:11.779 --> 05:14.014
You've reached
Naamah Mojtabai.

05:14.147 --> 05:17.017
Leave a message
and have a blessed day.

05:17.150 --> 05:18.952
Hey. Uh, it's me.

05:19.086 --> 05:22.022
Um, I could--
I could really use, um--

05:22.155 --> 05:23.891
I could use a Mom Talk
right about now.

05:24.024 --> 05:27.160
Um, well, I have
my first, uh, briefing

05:27.294 --> 05:29.530
with the Director of National
Intelligence this morning,

05:29.663 --> 05:32.400
and I am low-key freaking out.

05:32.533 --> 05:34.368
Um, if you get this, like,
in the next 10 minutes

05:34.502 --> 05:37.871
and you can call me back
or so, that would be super,
um, super.

05:38.005 --> 05:39.272
So...

05:42.410 --> 05:44.412
Yo! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

05:47.981 --> 05:49.383
Greetings
from El Conejo.

05:50.984 --> 05:52.553
I thought I'd thought
of everything.

05:53.654 --> 05:55.689
A villa that no one knew
I owned.

05:55.823 --> 05:59.259
A place of peace
and quiet.

05:59.393 --> 06:04.998
A place where Elizabeth could
listen and prepare.

06:07.334 --> 06:09.269
She was
to retrieve the box,

06:09.903 --> 06:10.971
sit right here...

06:13.306 --> 06:14.274
And learn the business.

06:15.242 --> 06:16.544
From you.

06:16.677 --> 06:18.278
I put all of it
into these recordings.

06:18.412 --> 06:19.847
Every bit of it.

06:19.980 --> 06:21.815
I knew I wouldn't be there
to help her,

06:21.949 --> 06:25.052
but I thought perhaps
my words could,

06:25.185 --> 06:28.856
that they would provide
whatever might be needed.

06:28.989 --> 06:31.358
And Kosta's job
was to wait for her.

06:31.492 --> 06:33.360
And to bring her here
when she arrived.

06:34.327 --> 06:35.996
So she could
open the safe.

06:38.532 --> 06:39.733
The safe
is one-of-a-kind.

06:40.734 --> 06:42.369
I had it constructed
in Switzerland

06:42.503 --> 06:44.438
to my specifications.

06:44.572 --> 06:47.240
Two thumbprints in the world
could open it.

06:48.075 --> 06:49.843
Mine and/or Elizabeth's.

06:50.911 --> 06:52.546
And you put this box
inside of it.

06:53.514 --> 06:54.515
Yes.

06:57.117 --> 07:00.521
And a few days ago,
I found it
in a dead cop's vault

07:01.722 --> 07:03.123
5,000 miles
away from here.

07:04.558 --> 07:05.358
The safe looks untouched.

07:06.994 --> 07:07.861
How do you think
they got inside it?

07:09.563 --> 07:10.631
I haven't a clue.

07:11.532 --> 07:12.833
Hence the bocce balls.

07:14.367 --> 07:15.636
We've been over it
and over it.

07:15.769 --> 07:16.837
So we just go over it again.

07:16.970 --> 07:19.106
And expect
a different result?

07:19.239 --> 07:22.242
You do know that's
the definition of insanity.

07:22.375 --> 07:26.079
Panabaker gave you a month
to identify who killed
Doug Koster

07:26.213 --> 07:28.415
before all those charges
against you are reimposed.

07:28.549 --> 07:29.717
Now, it would be
insane of us

07:29.850 --> 07:31.418
not to do everything
that we can

07:31.552 --> 07:32.720
to prevent that
from happening.

07:33.854 --> 07:35.856
I feel like I'm living
in purgatory.

07:35.989 --> 07:38.626
Worse, it feels like
Charlene and Agnes

07:38.759 --> 07:40.427
are living there with me.

07:40.561 --> 07:41.895
Hey,
anyone seen Aram today?

07:42.563 --> 07:43.564
He's not in yet?

07:43.697 --> 07:44.865
Haven't seen him, sir.

07:44.998 --> 07:46.800
I think you can
drop the "sir."

07:46.934 --> 07:48.468
To be honest,
I never liked it much.

07:48.602 --> 07:50.003
I prefer "Harold."

07:50.137 --> 07:52.906
Well, Harold, it's not
like Aram to be late.

07:53.040 --> 07:55.475
No, but he had
his first meeting

07:55.609 --> 07:57.645
with National Intelligence
today.

07:57.778 --> 07:59.647
Maybe he had to run home after
and change his shirt.

07:59.780 --> 08:01.749
Hm. Or his shorts.

08:01.882 --> 08:03.617
I know we're on the clock
with the investigation,

08:03.751 --> 08:07.454
but if he needs a pep talk
about what his new
responsibilities are,

08:07.588 --> 08:08.756
I think I'm the one
who should give it.

08:18.866 --> 08:19.900
Mrs. Mojtabai.

08:20.033 --> 08:21.769
Oh.

08:21.902 --> 08:23.804
Are you alright?
What happened?

08:23.937 --> 08:26.840
I don't know.
He called me.

08:26.974 --> 08:29.342
He said he wanted
to have a mom talk.

08:29.476 --> 08:31.812
You said he called.
What else did he say?

08:31.945 --> 08:33.346
We didn't talk.

08:33.480 --> 08:34.514
He left a message.

08:35.382 --> 08:36.950
Please find him.

08:51.965 --> 08:52.900
Okay.

09:00.307 --> 09:02.242
Ah.

09:03.110 --> 09:04.612
My package has arrived.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.151
I thought there'd be
more to you.

09:12.519 --> 09:13.353
Who are you?

09:14.655 --> 09:15.656
What am I doing here?

09:16.657 --> 09:18.592
I am Don Francisco
Luis Marquez.

09:19.860 --> 09:23.263
El Conejo to my best friends
and worst enemies.

09:25.398 --> 09:28.702
I know who you are,
Special Agent Mojtabai.

09:30.671 --> 09:32.005
And you stole from me.

09:39.813 --> 09:41.114
If you get this, like,
in the next 10 minutes

09:42.950 --> 09:44.584
and you can call me back
or so, that would be super,
um, super.

09:46.519 --> 09:48.221
Yo! Whoa! Whoa, whoa, whoa!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!

09:50.991 --> 09:52.325
Greetings from El Conejo.

09:54.561 --> 09:56.596
That came
from Aram's mother.

09:56.730 --> 09:58.766
The entire abduction
was recorded.

09:58.899 --> 10:02.035
Who's El Conejo,
and what's he want with Aram?

10:02.169 --> 10:03.737
As to the what,
I haven't the foggiest.

10:03.871 --> 10:05.538
The who
I can help you with.

10:05.673 --> 10:08.008
Dembe and I once chased
"The Rabbit"

10:08.141 --> 10:11.611
along an underground river
in the jungle in Quintana Roo.

10:11.745 --> 10:13.847
El Conejo
is Don Marquez?

10:13.981 --> 10:16.416
The Marquez Cartel.
The cocaine traffickers.

10:16.549 --> 10:17.951
Cocaine
was their business.

10:18.085 --> 10:21.221
Now they traffic
in a different cash crop.

10:21.354 --> 10:22.690
You know what it takes
to grow one of these?

10:24.825 --> 10:27.060
I never used
to interest myself
in such things.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.629
I'm more
of an import/export man.

10:31.932 --> 10:34.968
Avocados are
a multibillion-dollar industry

10:35.102 --> 10:37.470
run by family farming
operations.

10:37.604 --> 10:40.908
Or it was,
before the cartels took over

10:41.041 --> 10:43.443
through kidnapping,
torture, and murder.

10:43.576 --> 10:46.479
Think about that the next time
you order a Cobb salad.

10:46.613 --> 10:50.650
I-I gotta say, I-I'm still,
uh, wondering why I'm here.

10:52.853 --> 10:55.255
You know why,
you magician, you.

10:56.724 --> 10:59.259
You made an entire
tractor trailer of my product

10:59.392 --> 11:02.162
disappear into thin air
on its way over the border.

11:02.295 --> 11:03.263
I did?

11:03.396 --> 11:05.699
Now I'm out half a million,

11:05.833 --> 11:08.235
and my competitors
think I'm soft.

11:08.368 --> 11:10.738
Sir, I have no idea
where your truck is.

11:10.871 --> 11:12.205
If I did,
I would tell you.

11:12.339 --> 11:13.874
Uh, this is--
Uh, this is terrifying.

11:14.007 --> 11:16.609
I put in military-grade
firewalls,

11:16.744 --> 11:19.012
elliptic curve cryptography--
all of it state-of-the-art

11:19.146 --> 11:22.549
to protect my supply chains
and travel lines.

11:24.484 --> 11:30.223
What's terrifying
is that a piece of malware
chewed through it like a--

11:30.357 --> 11:32.125
Like a termite
through balsa wood.

11:33.426 --> 11:35.662
Marquez runs
his whole cartel

11:35.796 --> 11:39.466
through a notoriously
sophisticated server system.

11:39.599 --> 11:42.469
If there's a connection
to Aram,
you have to assume that's it.

11:42.602 --> 11:43.670
That's not much of a lead.

11:43.804 --> 11:45.072
No, but this is.

11:45.205 --> 11:47.674
The Scripps Brothers.
They built the server.

11:47.808 --> 11:48.876
How do you know that?

11:49.009 --> 11:50.543
Because Marquez
wanted my guy to do it,

11:50.677 --> 11:53.747
but my guy's exclusive to me
and has a curfew--

11:53.881 --> 11:55.348
And a very stern mother.

11:55.482 --> 11:57.550
So he recommended
the Scripps Brothers.

11:57.684 --> 12:01.354
I'd pay them a visit myself,
but I'm unavailable
at the moment.

12:01.488 --> 12:03.891
But I'll get you an address
for the Scripps.

12:04.024 --> 12:05.358
They're the best place
to start.

12:05.492 --> 12:07.160
You've got the wrong guy.

12:07.294 --> 12:09.562
Oh, I-I've worked on
a lot of programs,

12:09.696 --> 12:11.698
but I've never designed
anything in my life

12:11.832 --> 12:12.532
to hurt someone
or-- or cause--

12:12.665 --> 12:13.733
Armando.

12:16.403 --> 12:17.237
So--

12:21.208 --> 12:24.444
It took my team
half the day to find it
buried in the malware.

12:25.712 --> 12:27.180
Maybe you acted alone.

12:29.116 --> 12:30.383
Maybe you did it
for the FBI.

12:30.517 --> 12:32.285
I don't particularly care.

12:32.419 --> 12:34.855
But this has your name
all over it.

12:36.656 --> 12:37.424
Impressive stuff.

12:38.725 --> 12:40.460
If I didn't have to kill you,
I'd hire you.

12:43.296 --> 12:44.597
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Stop, stop!

12:44.731 --> 12:46.233
Please, please.
Stop, stop, stop.

12:46.366 --> 12:48.568
Before you do whatever
you're planning to do,

12:48.701 --> 12:51.204
can I please-- can I please
take a look at that?

12:53.506 --> 12:54.975
You want me to hand you
my computer?

12:55.108 --> 12:56.376
After everything
you've done?

12:56.509 --> 12:58.578
Sir, I have no idea
where your shipment is.

12:58.711 --> 13:00.513
I do not know
what that program is.

13:00.647 --> 13:03.216
But if you give me
that laptop, maybe--

13:03.350 --> 13:05.218
Maybe I can
help you figure this out.

13:06.319 --> 13:09.556
So, Teddy, who did it?

13:09.689 --> 13:11.591
I don't know,
'cause he doesn't know.

13:11.724 --> 13:13.060
Go back in there.

13:13.193 --> 13:15.562
Did I mention
my sciatica?
Teddy.

13:15.695 --> 13:18.665
Like getting poked in
the tenderloin by a narwhal!

13:21.935 --> 13:22.970
Want me to go in?

13:23.103 --> 13:24.437
It won't matter.

13:24.571 --> 13:27.140
If Teddy says
Kosta doesn't know
who broke into the safe,

13:27.274 --> 13:29.142
he doesn't know.

13:29.276 --> 13:30.878
We'll have to find the answer
some other way.

13:32.112 --> 13:33.246
Maybe you
know the answers.

13:33.746 --> 13:34.915
Me?

13:35.048 --> 13:36.884
Not you. You.

13:42.789 --> 13:44.057
The two of you
have been arrested

13:44.191 --> 13:46.894
by the NSA
seven times each?

13:47.794 --> 13:48.595
Eight for me.

13:48.728 --> 13:50.030
Shut up.

13:50.163 --> 13:52.799
And, Ritchie, you can't even
touch a computer in Norway

13:52.933 --> 13:55.335
without the threat
of immediate arrest.

13:55.468 --> 13:57.437
How did you piss off Norway
that bad?

13:57.570 --> 13:59.672
Lawyer. Lawyer. Lawyer.

13:59.806 --> 14:01.774
Look, geek squad, we don't
care about how many gigabytes

14:01.909 --> 14:03.877
you move around
in your mother's basement.

14:04.011 --> 14:06.679
An FBI agent is missing
and the clock's ticking
on his life.

14:09.316 --> 14:11.451
Okay. Suit yourself.

14:11.584 --> 14:12.953
But you're not gonna like
what comes next.

14:13.086 --> 14:14.287
Okay, cop.

14:20.193 --> 14:21.161
Hey, that's all our stuff.

14:21.294 --> 14:23.296
And seeing
how it was used

14:23.430 --> 14:25.598
to help build
a drug cartel's firewall,

14:25.732 --> 14:27.667
the FBI will be
impounding all of it.

14:27.800 --> 14:28.801
But you can't do that.

14:28.936 --> 14:30.403
We just did.

14:30.537 --> 14:32.772
Don't worry, though.
You'll get it all back.
Eventually.

14:35.308 --> 14:38.011
That was a $5,000
8K monitor!

14:38.145 --> 14:39.379
We're real clumsy
around here.

14:39.512 --> 14:40.813
Let me get you a receipt
for that.

14:41.781 --> 14:42.582
No, no, no, no.

14:44.184 --> 14:45.485
We can do this all day long.

14:45.618 --> 14:47.154
Now, you wanna
help us out, fellas,

14:47.287 --> 14:49.856
and maybe we'll give you
this cart of crap back
in one piece.

14:49.990 --> 14:51.424
Some of it, anyway.

14:51.558 --> 14:53.493
Okay, okay.
Just don't bust anything else.

14:54.361 --> 14:55.862
What do you need?

14:55.996 --> 14:58.231
Bad code is--
is like a bad recipe.

14:58.365 --> 15:00.267
A pinch of this,
a dash of that.

15:00.400 --> 15:02.202
To reverse engineer it,
though, you--

15:02.335 --> 15:04.237
You're working
without a cookbook.

15:04.371 --> 15:06.940
You're in the States?
No one told me
you were coming.

15:07.074 --> 15:08.041
It's not a good time, Antonio.

15:11.278 --> 15:12.312
We'll talk about it later.

15:17.450 --> 15:18.651
I hear it
from my brother--

15:18.785 --> 15:19.987
I'm here on business.

15:20.120 --> 15:21.554
Samuel works
in the business.

15:21.688 --> 15:22.755
You go to college.

15:22.889 --> 15:24.291
There. We talked.
Now go.

15:24.424 --> 15:25.692
No.

15:25.825 --> 15:27.860
What happens here, I don't
want you to be a part of it.

15:27.995 --> 15:29.062
What about
what I want?

15:29.196 --> 15:30.763
I-I see you, what?
Twice a year?

15:31.864 --> 15:33.433
Great.
Sic the goons on me.

15:33.566 --> 15:35.368
Drop me a postcard
next time you're around.

15:35.502 --> 15:36.503
Or don't.

15:42.409 --> 15:44.711
Um, Mr. Marquez,
I found something.

15:46.846 --> 15:48.215
Okay, uh, this here,

15:48.348 --> 15:50.417
this building block
is part of a longer code

15:50.550 --> 15:51.884
I wrote for a program
called Greylock.

15:52.019 --> 15:54.521
That is why I signed my name
to it like that.

15:54.954 --> 15:56.056
As a joke.

15:56.189 --> 15:57.590
So this was all you?

15:57.724 --> 16:01.794
No. No, this--
the rest of this isn't me.

16:01.928 --> 16:03.263
Somebody stole my work.

16:06.333 --> 16:08.168
So this is
the Marquez network.

16:09.436 --> 16:10.903
You get in and out
just like that?

16:11.038 --> 16:12.972
We built a back door.
Sue us.

16:13.106 --> 16:14.807
So what do you
want to know?

16:14.941 --> 16:16.643
Anything that tells us
where Marquez took our agent.

16:18.445 --> 16:20.247
Don't even have to look
that hard.

16:20.380 --> 16:21.981
The guy you're missing's
some kind of tech wizard,
yeah?

16:22.115 --> 16:23.650
How do you know that?

16:23.783 --> 16:25.485
There's a user
in the network now
poking around at everything.

16:25.618 --> 16:27.020
It's some serious
bandwidth.

16:27.154 --> 16:29.056
Can you get us
a location?

16:29.189 --> 16:32.425
I wrote some of this,
but someone weaponized
the rest.

16:32.559 --> 16:34.294
The rootkit I wrote
to attack intruders

16:34.427 --> 16:36.629
was used to gut
your firewall

16:36.763 --> 16:38.565
and gain access
to your shipping lines.

16:38.698 --> 16:41.201
There is somebody out there
who targeted you

16:41.334 --> 16:42.635
and they used
my work to do it.

16:45.972 --> 16:46.939
Wait a minute.

16:47.074 --> 16:48.075
What?

16:49.576 --> 16:50.843
Someone built
an apex predator.

16:52.279 --> 16:53.580
You could use it
to rob banks,

16:53.713 --> 16:56.549
to disrupt utility services,
take down power grids.

16:56.683 --> 16:57.884
Right now, I just want
the shipment back.

17:02.422 --> 17:04.457
Who is this? How the hell
did you get this number?

17:04.591 --> 17:07.860
I have your missing product.
Half a million. Cash.

17:07.994 --> 17:09.929
I'll call in one hour
with delivery instructions.

17:12.865 --> 17:14.567
Get Samuel.
And lock up the agent.

17:14.701 --> 17:15.502
I'll deal with him later.

17:19.106 --> 17:19.972
Hello, Elizabeth.

17:21.141 --> 17:22.809
I hope you're comfortable,

17:22.942 --> 17:25.712
sitting down
with something good to drink.

17:27.180 --> 17:29.682
There's always plenty to eat
in the larder.

17:29.816 --> 17:31.818
So please feel free
at any time

17:31.951 --> 17:34.187
to shut me up
and help yourself.

17:35.522 --> 17:38.291
If you're watching this,
I must be dead

17:40.360 --> 17:42.262
and the business
must be yours.

17:43.896 --> 17:44.864
I'm relieved.

17:45.532 --> 17:48.034
And excited for you.

17:48.168 --> 17:52.004
And worried,
as you might expect.

17:53.440 --> 17:55.041
It's strange.

17:55.175 --> 17:59.612
Even with all the gunfire
and killers in my life,

17:59.746 --> 18:01.581
I've never really worried
about myself.

18:03.183 --> 18:05.852
I've been much too busy
worrying about you.

18:05.985 --> 18:07.420
Oh, my God, what a pain
in the ass I've been.

18:08.788 --> 18:10.990
Anyway.

18:11.858 --> 18:16.296
What lies ahead is a glorious,

18:16.429 --> 18:21.934
treacherous, and, I hope,
rewarding journey.

18:22.068 --> 18:24.837
If you'll permit me,
I'd like to share with you

18:26.706 --> 18:31.878
some things that I've learned
over a lifetime of bad deeds

18:32.011 --> 18:33.313
and good intentions.

18:34.847 --> 18:40.553
So let's take a walk
together one last time.

18:51.030 --> 18:53.866
Congratulations,
you genius son-of-a--

18:54.000 --> 18:55.902
We did it.
You know what this means?

18:56.035 --> 18:57.904
It means we can start planning
to sell this thing.

18:58.037 --> 19:00.006
I, uh-- I still think
we should tinker.

19:00.139 --> 19:01.341
There are some diagnostics I
want to take another look at--

19:01.474 --> 19:03.676
Aram, you're killing me.

19:03.810 --> 19:05.312
Well, it's not ready
till it's ready.

19:05.445 --> 19:07.447
When?
The next epoch?

19:07.580 --> 19:09.282
We have
the VitasNow report.

19:09.416 --> 19:11.150
They gave us
a clean bill of health.

19:11.284 --> 19:13.553
We paid a third party
for their assessment--

19:13.686 --> 19:17.089
To find flaws, problems,
data gaps,

19:17.224 --> 19:18.525
things we could've missed,
right?

19:18.658 --> 19:19.792
They're only one company.

19:19.926 --> 19:21.794
Who double-checked
everything.

19:21.928 --> 19:23.596
Our I's are dotted,
T's are crossed.

19:23.730 --> 19:25.965
I read it. You read it.
Relax. It's time to celebrate.

19:26.098 --> 19:27.099
Yeah, but they did, uh,

19:27.234 --> 19:28.501
point out a few glitches
with peripherals--

19:28.635 --> 19:30.470
Oh, please, no jargon.

19:30.603 --> 19:33.139
You know I don't
speak circuit board.

19:33.273 --> 19:36.576
They didn't spot anything that
couldn't be patched up easily.

19:37.677 --> 19:40.146
Bottom line--
they were happy for us.

19:40.280 --> 19:42.949
And I'm happy for us,
'cause we're gonna be
stinking rich.

19:44.651 --> 19:46.486
You know
what we need now?

19:46.619 --> 19:48.288
More champagne
and a strip club.

19:48.421 --> 19:50.189
Oh, I-I can't.

19:50.323 --> 19:52.024
Uh, I, uh-- I actually
have dinner plans

19:52.158 --> 19:53.826
with my parents tonight.

19:53.960 --> 19:54.927
Aram, seriously.

19:56.429 --> 19:57.530
You're killing me.

20:00.066 --> 20:01.167
FBI!

20:01.301 --> 20:02.502
Go, go, go!

20:04.036 --> 20:05.638
FBI! Hands! Hands!

20:11.778 --> 20:13.813
Hey, bud.
How's your morning going?

20:13.946 --> 20:14.681
How'd you find me?

20:16.082 --> 20:18.685
HRT is clearing the space.
No sign of Marquez.

20:18.818 --> 20:20.720
Uh, he got a ransom call
about avocados.

20:20.853 --> 20:23.055
Apparently guacamole
is the new angel dust.

20:23.189 --> 20:25.292
We managed
to bag this one.

20:25.425 --> 20:26.459
Let's hope
he knows something.

20:30.162 --> 20:32.064
There's a lot to the shipping.

20:32.198 --> 20:34.834
But the most crucial part
of shipping--

20:36.235 --> 20:38.738
Sun Tzu wrote,
"The greatest victory

20:38.871 --> 20:40.407
is that which requires
no battle."

20:40.540 --> 20:42.208
I would agree.

20:42.342 --> 20:44.043
If you want to make your enemy
your friend,

20:44.176 --> 20:46.546
create a problem for them
and then solve it.

20:46.679 --> 20:48.515
It's that simple.

20:48.648 --> 20:49.882
You'll want to take notes now.

20:50.016 --> 20:51.784
The following is a list
of 12 wines

20:51.918 --> 20:53.286
that pair with everything.

20:53.420 --> 20:55.788
I've said a lot
about the mechanics

20:55.922 --> 20:59.926
of how to operate my--
uh, your empire.

21:02.028 --> 21:04.297
But much more important
than that

21:04.431 --> 21:09.469
is managing
the emotional reality

21:09.602 --> 21:14.040
of running this enterprise.

21:14.173 --> 21:20.580
And to do that, you must
understand one concept
above all else.

21:22.014 --> 21:24.417
You have thousands
of talented people

21:24.551 --> 21:27.086
who work for and with you,

21:27.219 --> 21:29.756
thousands of people
who you are responsible for.

21:31.023 --> 21:34.727
But at the end of the day,
you're alone.

21:38.865 --> 21:40.299
Nick. Uh, me again.

21:41.968 --> 21:44.571
We need to talk.
Uh, you have my number.
Uh, thank you.

21:44.704 --> 21:45.905
You should go to a hospital.

21:46.038 --> 21:47.640
No, I got a better idea--

21:47.774 --> 21:49.275
Us figuring out
why you were kidnapped

21:49.409 --> 21:51.277
by a bloodthirsty
avocado cartel.

21:51.411 --> 21:52.812
Uh, the why is easy--

21:52.945 --> 21:54.481
Marquez thinks I hacked
into his system,

21:54.614 --> 21:56.082
accessed
his delivery routes,

21:56.215 --> 21:59.151
and stole his product,
but it wasn't me.

21:59.285 --> 22:01.921
But he found your digital
signature in his system.

22:02.054 --> 22:04.557
Yes. Uh, which means
my Greylock source code

22:04.691 --> 22:06.693
was stolen
by our avocado thief.

22:06.826 --> 22:08.595
Who had access to it,
besides you?

22:08.728 --> 22:10.329
Uh, my former
business partner, Nick,

22:10.463 --> 22:12.532
but he doesn't know HTML
from hieroglyphics,

22:12.665 --> 22:15.768
and, for like a second,
this third-party
risk assessment firm

22:15.902 --> 22:17.637
we hired to spotlight
any glitches.

22:17.770 --> 22:21.073
I-It was early on,
but they definitely had a copy
of unlocked source code.

22:21.207 --> 22:22.475
Can I make a suggestion?

22:22.609 --> 22:24.143
Of course.

22:24.276 --> 22:26.145
Well, we have
two avenues here.

22:26.278 --> 22:28.548
Someone set up Aram.
We need to know who.

22:28.681 --> 22:30.517
We also need
to track Marquez.

22:30.650 --> 22:33.085
A man like that is never
in the States long.

22:33.219 --> 22:36.489
This may be our one shot
at getting a cartel leader.

22:36.623 --> 22:38.124
So we divide and conquer.

22:38.257 --> 22:40.860
Aram follows up with
the third-party company.

22:40.993 --> 22:42.395
Someone's in charge there.

22:42.529 --> 22:43.630
Bring them in,
get to the bottom of this.

22:48.067 --> 22:49.769
The rest of you should focus

22:49.902 --> 22:51.804
on getting whatever
information you can
out of our new guest.

22:53.540 --> 22:54.507
What do you think?

22:55.141 --> 22:55.875
Let's do it.

22:59.446 --> 23:00.379
Thank you for that.

23:00.513 --> 23:01.380
Anytime, boss.

23:03.750 --> 23:04.817
Antonio?

23:06.285 --> 23:07.520
It was a long drive
back to Princeton.

23:07.654 --> 23:08.855
I knew the place
was empty--

23:08.988 --> 23:10.757
This is a safehouse,
not a crash pad.
Get out of here.

23:13.793 --> 23:15.828
What is it?
Que paso?

23:15.962 --> 23:18.064
The FBI raided
the downtown warehouse.

23:18.197 --> 23:20.399
They grabbed Machado.
They took back their agent.

23:20.533 --> 23:23.035
Agent? Th-Th-That was an agent
you had captive?

23:23.169 --> 23:24.370
Why do you think
I wanted you
out of there?

23:24.504 --> 23:25.605
For your own good.

23:29.909 --> 23:31.978
A business matter.

23:32.111 --> 23:33.880
The FBI--
Yeah, it is dangerous.

23:34.013 --> 23:35.047
That's why you need
to let us handle it.

23:38.685 --> 23:41.253
You should never
be deceived into believing

23:41.387 --> 23:44.857
that you can really
trust anyone.

23:46.826 --> 23:52.599
My experience is that even
my most intimate partners,

23:52.732 --> 23:57.303
advisers, and friends have
had occasion to betray me.

23:58.771 --> 24:02.041
You must always be
mentally prepared

24:02.174 --> 24:06.345
to separate yourself
from anyone
and anything in your life.

24:08.648 --> 24:09.782
Because people will turn.

24:12.184 --> 24:13.920
You know what
I'm talking about.

24:14.053 --> 24:15.254
You witnessed it
with Mr. Kaplan.

24:15.387 --> 24:16.455
Hell, you've done it yourself.

24:18.424 --> 24:21.594
I'm sorry if I made it sound
all doom and gloom.

24:22.328 --> 24:23.395
Lonely.

24:24.030 --> 24:24.964
It's not.

24:26.032 --> 24:27.967
There's a freedom
in your new role.

24:29.101 --> 24:30.903
Freedom from convention.

24:31.738 --> 24:33.673
From being a follower.

24:35.241 --> 24:40.146
The pack takes its cue
from the alpha wolf.

24:40.279 --> 24:43.315
And when that wolf
is wise and mindful,

24:44.450 --> 24:45.585
the whole pack prospers.

24:47.419 --> 24:52.224
That said, you will
have one blind spot,

24:52.358 --> 24:57.129
one weakness that
can't be willed out of you.

24:59.265 --> 25:00.432
And that's Agnes.

25:02.569 --> 25:04.203
I have no advice
for you there.

25:05.605 --> 25:08.941
All I can tell you is, uh,
do your best,

25:20.720 --> 25:22.622
My company is highly respected
in the industry.

25:24.223 --> 25:26.125
I don't know what you
think happened with
your source code--

25:26.258 --> 25:27.660
You turned my software
into a weapon.

25:29.261 --> 25:31.363
You took something
meant to help
and protect people

25:31.497 --> 25:33.532
and stripped it for parts
until it was dangerous.

25:33.666 --> 25:36.703
Agent Mojtabai,
I've reviewed your file.

25:36.836 --> 25:39.706
Based on what I saw,
nothing you've said here
surprises me,

25:39.839 --> 25:42.875
except that you blame us for
a problem of your own making.

25:44.644 --> 25:46.345
What are you
talking about?

25:46.478 --> 25:48.547
You hired us to do
an independent review

25:48.681 --> 25:50.382
of your source code.

25:50.516 --> 25:52.619
Our conclusions
were clear.

25:52.752 --> 25:54.286
Perhaps you've forgotten
how clear.

25:56.623 --> 25:58.357
You must not have read
our report.

25:58.490 --> 25:59.659
I brought you
another copy.

26:03.830 --> 26:05.097
I read it
cover-to-cover.

26:05.231 --> 26:07.033
My business partner,
Nick, read it, too.

26:07.166 --> 26:08.200
Then you didn't
read it thoroughly.

26:09.769 --> 26:10.803
See for yourself.

26:13.139 --> 26:15.207
Aside from
a few minor glitches,

26:15.341 --> 26:18.177
you gave us
a clean bill of health.

26:25.685 --> 26:26.518
What are these sections?

26:28.354 --> 26:29.255
Implementations?

26:31.057 --> 26:32.024
Vulnerabilities?

26:36.495 --> 26:37.396
I've never seen
any of these.

26:41.901 --> 26:43.936
Dammit, Nick.

26:44.070 --> 26:47.106
See, no one needed to turn
your software into a weapon.

26:47.239 --> 26:48.808
Because I built a weapon
from the start.

26:52.544 --> 26:54.413
What time do Conroy and
the others get here tomorrow?

26:54.546 --> 26:57.216
15, and the buyers should
arrive shortly after that.

26:58.985 --> 27:00.386
You knew
this whole time.

27:00.519 --> 27:01.854
Sorry, you're not supposed
to be in here.

27:01.988 --> 27:03.122
It's okay, Chloe.

27:03.255 --> 27:04.657
This is the godfather
of Greylock.

27:04.791 --> 27:06.425
The man who invented us.

27:06.558 --> 27:08.260
Everything we've accomplished
is because of him.

27:10.697 --> 27:12.631
What happened to you?
You fall off your bike?

27:12.765 --> 27:13.933
Remember this?

27:15.467 --> 27:18.604
I had a little chat
with Walter Sykes
from VitasNow,

27:18.738 --> 27:20.606
and this is
their full report,

27:20.740 --> 27:22.641
with all those sections
you didn't bother to show me.

27:22.775 --> 27:24.576
You know, the ones that said
there's vulnerability

27:24.711 --> 27:26.078
in the Greylock
source code?

27:28.915 --> 27:30.717
I don't know if you took
a look around on the way in,

27:30.850 --> 27:32.284
but we're way
past source code.

27:32.418 --> 27:34.186
Remember Conroy?
All that financing?

27:34.320 --> 27:35.621
That was
just the beginning.

27:35.755 --> 27:37.857
We're pitching
buyers tomorrow.
Sky's the limit.

27:37.990 --> 27:39.926
You lied to me.

27:40.059 --> 27:42.228
I sat right there
and you lied to my face.

27:42.361 --> 27:44.396
I omitted.
I held a few things back.

27:46.032 --> 27:48.334
What did this company know
that you and I didn't?

27:48.467 --> 27:50.202
If something was really wrong,
you would've fixed it.

27:50.336 --> 27:51.838
You know I was too close
to the project.

27:51.971 --> 27:55.274
I couldn't see it.
That is why we hired them.

27:55.407 --> 27:57.309
Do you know how dangerous
this could be?

27:57.443 --> 28:00.512
If the wrong person
with the right know-how
got access to Greylock,

28:00.646 --> 28:03.649
they could strip it down
to its most dangerous parts

28:03.783 --> 28:05.317
and use it
to cripple systems.

28:05.451 --> 28:06.485
Systems have flaws.

28:07.353 --> 28:08.955
So do people.

28:09.088 --> 28:10.356
And I won't destroy
this company

28:10.489 --> 28:13.492
because a bad guy
might misuse what we made.

28:13.625 --> 28:15.094
They make
baseball bats, Aram.

28:15.227 --> 28:16.462
Even though someone
might use it

28:16.595 --> 28:17.663
to crack somebody
over the head--

28:17.797 --> 28:19.331
You can't
keep selling this.

28:19.465 --> 28:21.901
I can as long as clients
want to buy it.

28:22.034 --> 28:23.970
There might be a few bad eggs.
It happens.

28:24.103 --> 28:25.872
I want this program out there
so the rest of our customers

28:26.005 --> 28:27.206
can use it
for the good you intended.

28:27.339 --> 28:29.375
No. You want it out there
so you can be rich.

28:32.478 --> 28:33.445
Chloe was right.
You shouldn't be in here.

28:34.180 --> 28:35.882
You should leave.

28:36.015 --> 28:37.649
It's too soon for Marquez

28:37.784 --> 28:38.985
to have gotten
out of the country.

28:39.118 --> 28:41.420
Where's he hiding?
In the city? Nearby?

28:41.553 --> 28:42.588
I don't know
where he is.

28:44.190 --> 28:45.858
But I know
where he's gonna be.

28:45.992 --> 28:48.027
How would you know that?

28:48.160 --> 28:52.765
I overheard El Conejo
get the second phone call
about his missing shipment.

28:52.899 --> 28:55.167
I know the time and the place
for the exchange.

28:56.068 --> 28:58.237
I'll share it,
for a trade.

28:59.438 --> 29:00.873
What trade?

29:01.007 --> 29:03.009
I want to be sent back
to Mexico for trial.

29:04.276 --> 29:05.711
Oh, let me guess--

29:05.845 --> 29:08.781
Because you've got a friend in
the Fiscalia General's office?

29:08.915 --> 29:10.216
There's not gonna be
any trial, will there?

29:10.349 --> 29:12.785
You wanna worry about
a little fish like me?

29:12.919 --> 29:15.587
Or go after the big fish
like Marquez?

29:21.360 --> 29:22.962
You kidnapped an FBI agent?

29:23.095 --> 29:26.132
You threatened him
over a truckload of,
what, vegetables?

29:26.265 --> 29:27.900
Avocados are a fruit,
imbecile.

29:28.034 --> 29:29.936
You're sick.
The both of you.

29:30.069 --> 29:31.070
This whole thing...

29:36.475 --> 29:39.812
Since the day you were born,
I knew you were weak.

29:39.946 --> 29:44.416
You were built to sit
behind a desk or a library.

29:44.550 --> 29:48.888
I saw it, and I let you
stay soft-- to keep you safe.

29:50.589 --> 29:53.225
But if you ever question
my judgment
or my control again,

29:54.293 --> 29:57.129
so help me, boy,
you will learn a lesson

29:57.263 --> 29:59.398
in what a real man of power
can do.

30:05.337 --> 30:07.273
Now, you wait here,
until we're long gone.

30:24.290 --> 30:25.391
There will come a time,
Elizabeth,

30:26.525 --> 30:29.428
when you are
completely stumped,

30:29.561 --> 30:34.433
a time when you will have
factored in every variable

30:34.566 --> 30:36.468
and you still
won't see the answer.

30:36.602 --> 30:38.670
But it'll be there.
Somewhere.

30:38.804 --> 30:41.673
The answer is--
is always there.

30:41.807 --> 30:43.542
And when you can't see it,

30:43.675 --> 30:46.478
it's because some assumption
that you've made,

30:46.612 --> 30:50.182
something you've taken
for granted is false.

30:50.316 --> 30:52.351
You think you're in a hospital
in France.

30:52.484 --> 30:54.353
It may not be France
or a hospital.

30:54.486 --> 30:57.689
It may be New York
and a warehouse.

30:57.823 --> 31:00.226
The magician
doesn't trick you.

31:00.359 --> 31:01.660
The magician helps you
trick yourself.

31:12.338 --> 31:13.672
That looks fun.

31:13.805 --> 31:15.641
Cheecha's a god-send.

31:15.774 --> 31:19.511
I'm pain free and looser
than a kangaroo's tummy.

31:21.981 --> 31:23.482
I think it's a trick,
an illusion.

31:25.151 --> 31:26.185
He figured it out.

31:27.987 --> 31:30.489
Ooh. Yeah. Oh, baby! Aah!

31:39.098 --> 31:41.233
I wanted to know
who got into my safe.

31:42.634 --> 31:45.004
I should've been asking
whether this is my safe.

31:47.839 --> 31:49.041
They tore mine out.

31:49.175 --> 31:52.478
You can see
exactly where there.

31:52.611 --> 31:54.981
And they replaced it
with a perfect replica.

31:55.114 --> 31:57.716
Then they were free to take
the original safe somewhere

31:57.849 --> 31:59.751
and drill for days
if they needed to.

32:01.053 --> 32:02.221
How did Kosta not know?

32:02.354 --> 32:03.722
Oh.

32:03.855 --> 32:06.858
An afternoon away.
An evening at the opera.

32:07.559 --> 32:09.361
Doesn't matter.

32:09.495 --> 32:12.531
That was then.
The now is in Zurich.

32:12.664 --> 32:14.866
And his name is
Heinrich Zimmerstahl.

32:51.937 --> 32:54.040
I brought your ransom.

32:54.173 --> 32:56.808
But we both know you're never
gonna touch a dollar.

32:56.942 --> 32:57.909
Because
you're not leaving.

32:59.345 --> 33:00.979
This place is now
your graveyard.

33:01.647 --> 33:03.182
I bury you here.

33:03.315 --> 33:04.983
What are you doing?
We don't have
the shipment yet.

33:05.117 --> 33:06.952
Look around.

33:07.086 --> 33:08.420
His only way out of here
is through us,

33:09.421 --> 33:10.822
and he won't even
get that far.

33:16.928 --> 33:17.663
What if I want
to get caught?

33:18.564 --> 33:19.865
Antonio?

33:21.500 --> 33:23.635
What in God's name
are you doing?

33:23.769 --> 33:25.937
Do I still seem weak to you?
Like I belong behind a desk?

33:26.072 --> 33:27.506
You gotta be joking.

33:27.639 --> 33:28.340
How many years of it
do you think I could stand it,
Dad?

33:28.474 --> 33:29.741
Of what?

33:29.875 --> 33:32.211
Of not being allowed to know
about the family business.

33:32.344 --> 33:35.447
Of not getting a phone call
when my own father
is just a few hours away.

33:35.581 --> 33:37.349
You're not strong enough.

33:37.483 --> 33:38.584
You mean
not Samuel enough.

33:38.717 --> 33:39.951
It has nothing
to do with Samuel.

33:41.387 --> 33:43.622
I always wanted
the best for you. Always!

33:43.755 --> 33:46.192
You wanted me gone.
The college boy in America.

33:46.325 --> 33:48.727
I outsmarted you.
I took your truck.

33:48.860 --> 33:50.662
I ransomed it back
right under your nose.

33:51.697 --> 33:53.299
What do you say to that?

33:53.432 --> 33:54.666
Am I strong enough now?

33:59.171 --> 34:01.006
Get down!
FBI!

34:01.140 --> 34:03.142
Get down!
You think you're
so smart, huh?

34:03.275 --> 34:04.476
Don't move!
Down!

34:04.610 --> 34:06.545
You led the FBI
right to us.

34:06.678 --> 34:08.880
Me? How about you
and your ego?

34:09.014 --> 34:11.550
Kidnapping.
Calling attention to yourself.

34:11.683 --> 34:12.884
Like a fool.

34:13.018 --> 34:15.187
It was you?
This whole time?

34:15.321 --> 34:17.323
I did
what I had to do.

34:17.456 --> 34:18.990
Look.
He's paying attention now.

34:19.125 --> 34:20.159
You want my attention?

34:20.292 --> 34:21.593
You want to be part
of this business?

34:21.727 --> 34:24.096
Okay. Okay, how about
we de-escalate?

34:24.230 --> 34:26.265
There's a cost
to this business!

34:26.398 --> 34:28.400
You can talk about it
in family therapy tomorrow.

34:28.534 --> 34:31.170
And this is what happens
when you cross El Conejo.

34:31.303 --> 34:32.704
Gun!

34:32.838 --> 34:35.073
- Drop it!
- I got it.

34:35.207 --> 34:37.676
Ah!

34:37.809 --> 34:39.378
You're okay.
He needs an ambulance.

34:39.511 --> 34:41.680
Do you?
I'm fine.

34:41.813 --> 34:43.515
But I'm never touching
an avocado again.

34:50.689 --> 34:52.090
I almost died today
because of you, kid.

34:56.562 --> 34:57.796
Twice.

34:57.929 --> 34:59.598
I didn't think
it would go that far.

35:00.432 --> 35:01.967
I didn't think
he would...

35:07.706 --> 35:08.940
How are you even
involved in this?

35:09.074 --> 35:11.443
It was my code you used
to hack your dad's business.

35:11.577 --> 35:13.912
Really?
Th-That's cool.

35:14.546 --> 35:16.382
Cool?

35:16.515 --> 35:17.583
How did you even get ahold
of it to begin with?

35:19.084 --> 35:21.453
Uh, my roommate
at Princeton.

35:21.587 --> 35:22.588
He's a
computer science major.

35:23.855 --> 35:26.458
He saw a beta test version
of the--

35:26.592 --> 35:29.661
Of your software
in his programming class.

35:29.795 --> 35:32.598
He made some minor tweaks,
took the rootkit,

35:32.731 --> 35:35.334
made it offensive,
saw how dangerous
and adaptable it was,

35:35.467 --> 35:36.568
and said he needed
to test it out.

35:37.836 --> 35:40.138
I had the perfect target--
my father.

35:41.673 --> 35:44.776
Your roommate weaponized
my code in a dorm room?

35:46.077 --> 35:47.279
He said it was
the perfect weapon.

35:48.514 --> 35:49.581
You should know.
You built it.

35:59.325 --> 36:00.592
I'm sorry, Kosta.

36:02.127 --> 36:05.431
I would never betray you,
Raymond, but I did fail.

36:06.832 --> 36:08.734
You left this house safe
with me,

36:08.867 --> 36:12.137
and somehow,
I let the enemy slip inside.

36:12.271 --> 36:16.007
I walked by that safe
hundreds of times,
and I had no idea.

36:16.141 --> 36:17.609
You wouldn't have.
I didn't see it.

36:18.944 --> 36:20.312
It was just
a good guess.

36:22.714 --> 36:25.517
When this is over,
the house and everything in it
are yours.

36:26.685 --> 36:29.054
Keep it, sell it.
I don't care.

36:29.187 --> 36:30.188
It's all yours.

36:37.529 --> 36:40.766
You'll forgive me if I let you
see yourself out.

36:46.572 --> 36:47.639
Mr. Zimmerstahl
has arrived.

36:52.311 --> 36:53.479
Raymond.

36:54.546 --> 36:56.815
It's been years.

36:56.948 --> 36:59.351
I was telling
your associate here

36:59.485 --> 37:01.353
about the first time
we met.

37:01.487 --> 37:04.856
The St. Moritz
Snow Polo World Cup, 2005.

37:04.990 --> 37:09.094
I haven't gone near a drop
of peppermint schnapps since.

37:10.662 --> 37:11.697
Come with me.

37:12.864 --> 37:15.233
When I came to see you
all those years ago,

37:15.367 --> 37:19.805
I told you I needed
a particularly secure safe.

37:19.938 --> 37:23.208
I told you that safe needed
to be one-of-a-kind.
Do you remember?

37:23.342 --> 37:24.343
I do.

37:34.353 --> 37:35.754
You're really going through
with it, huh?

37:36.988 --> 37:38.690
I can think of a thousand
terrible things

37:38.824 --> 37:41.393
the wrong person could do
if the Greylock code
went wide,

37:41.527 --> 37:45.531
but what scares me most are
the things I cannot think of.

37:47.533 --> 37:49.100
I have to stop this
before Nick
gets more funding.

37:51.670 --> 37:52.704
You're doing
the right thing.

38:00.379 --> 38:01.613
Watch your step.

38:03.181 --> 38:04.282
Oh, dear.

38:05.351 --> 38:08.820
What happened? Ah.

38:08.954 --> 38:12.891
That box was one of the finest
I'd ever constructed.

38:13.024 --> 38:15.361
I couldn't agree more.
One of the finest.

38:15.494 --> 38:17.729
The problem--
that's not my safe.

38:19.398 --> 38:24.536
My safe is gone, and the one
in its place is identical.

38:24.670 --> 38:29.140
One person is capable
of that kind of craftsmanship.

38:30.108 --> 38:31.242
You.

38:34.580 --> 38:36.114
You built a second safe,
didn't you?

38:37.282 --> 38:38.316
Well, of course I did.

38:40.251 --> 38:41.252
Excuse me?

38:41.387 --> 38:43.622
I made a second.
Identical.

38:45.591 --> 38:47.058
For whom?

38:47.192 --> 38:50.429
Raymond, I made it for you.

39:04.275 --> 39:05.777
Having problems
with your source code, Nick?

39:06.912 --> 39:08.980
Is this you?
Did you do this?

39:09.114 --> 39:10.716
Nothing in Greylock
will respond.

39:10.849 --> 39:13.118
And you didn't even start
the space camp program
for those kids.

39:13.251 --> 39:14.152
What?

39:15.421 --> 39:17.689
It's over, Nick.
I went into the servers.

39:17.823 --> 39:20.125
I undid the architecture,
framework, databases--

39:20.258 --> 39:21.860
Aram, I have a buyers'
presentation in 10 minutes.

39:21.993 --> 39:24.095
Conroy's in there.
Three other angels.

39:24.229 --> 39:25.163
What am I
supposed to tell them?

39:25.296 --> 39:26.465
Tell them the truth.

39:29.000 --> 39:31.069
Dude.

39:31.202 --> 39:32.538
It's not too late.
You can fix it.

39:32.671 --> 39:35.407
I could, but I won't.

39:35.541 --> 39:38.877
And it would take the best
IT team in the world months

39:39.010 --> 39:40.579
to undo what I did.

39:42.848 --> 39:44.149
Oh.

39:44.282 --> 39:45.584
Do you have any idea

39:45.717 --> 39:47.352
what's already been done
with our software?

39:47.486 --> 39:49.655
A couple of idiot kids
in a dorm room

39:49.788 --> 39:51.823
used it to hack
a drug cartel.

39:51.957 --> 39:53.625
What about the next person
who gets their hands on it

39:53.759 --> 39:55.126
and knows how to modify
the rootkit?

39:55.260 --> 39:56.728
I don't know what the hell
you're talking about.

39:56.862 --> 39:57.896
And I don't think
you ever did.

40:00.866 --> 40:01.900
My code was never safe
with you.

40:03.902 --> 40:05.837
You know what you tell them
in the other room?

40:05.971 --> 40:07.706
You tell them that
your ex-business partner

40:07.839 --> 40:08.907
did what he set out
to do.

40:11.242 --> 40:12.611
He tried to make the world
a little safer.

40:23.054 --> 40:24.255
Can you come in a minute?

40:31.697 --> 40:33.565
Reggie Cole is dead.

40:33.699 --> 40:34.900
The trail on the gunman
went cold,

40:35.033 --> 40:36.535
but there is one lead
left to follow.

40:37.936 --> 40:40.539
The lawyer.
What was his name?

40:40.672 --> 40:42.073
Lacroix.

40:42.207 --> 40:45.911
The man must've
had associates,
a legal practice, a family.

40:46.044 --> 40:47.779
Let's find out everything
we can about him.

40:47.913 --> 40:49.715
Sure.
What do we have to lose?

40:49.848 --> 40:52.884
I have everything to lose,
but that's not gonna stop me.

40:53.018 --> 40:55.053
I'm so sorry, Raymond.

40:55.186 --> 40:57.856
I had no idea you were
going to be robbed.

40:57.989 --> 41:00.692
You say you made
the duplicate for me?

41:00.826 --> 41:03.461
Well, no.
Not you directly.

41:04.563 --> 41:05.597
Then who?

41:05.731 --> 41:07.165
A woman.

41:07.298 --> 41:10.101
She came to me and she said
she was your representative.

41:10.936 --> 41:12.638
She knew
everything about you.

41:12.771 --> 41:14.806
She knew everything
about the safe.

41:14.940 --> 41:17.008
She was clear
she wanted it made

41:17.142 --> 41:21.212
to the same specifications
as the original.

41:21.346 --> 41:24.249
She paid with
the same bank accounts.

41:24.382 --> 41:28.253
The only thing different
was using uncoded

41:28.386 --> 41:33.559
ready-to-set biometric panels
for the thumb scan.

41:33.692 --> 41:35.326
So anyone could open
the new one.

41:36.628 --> 41:39.798
At the time, I assumed
you'd simply set it later.

41:41.432 --> 41:43.935
Tell me everything that you
can remember about the woman.

41:44.770 --> 41:46.705
Oof. It was so long ago.

41:49.340 --> 41:51.109
I remember glasses.

41:53.378 --> 41:54.580
She wasn't very tall.

41:58.216 --> 41:59.851
I do remember
one other thing.

42:00.952 --> 42:01.920
Go on.

42:02.053 --> 42:03.521
It happened several times.

42:05.256 --> 42:06.625
She called me "deary."

42:06.992 --> 42:08.026
Deary?

42:08.159 --> 42:10.796
And she called herself
"Mister."

42:12.297 --> 42:13.031
Kaplan?

42:13.765 --> 42:15.033
Yes, Raymond.

42:16.034 --> 42:17.468
Mr. Kaplan.
