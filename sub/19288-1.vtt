00:31.164 --> 00:32.564
- What does this guy do, again?

00:34.034 --> 00:36.135
- He's my business manager.

00:36.137 --> 00:37.536
Pays all my bills.

00:37.538 --> 00:40.105
Telephone, rent, charge cards,
everything.

00:41.074 --> 00:42.241
I want him to pay yours too.

00:42.243 --> 00:44.410
I mean, let's face it:

00:44.412 --> 00:46.545
We both recently got
huge cash settlements,

00:46.547 --> 00:49.782
we don't
need to worry about money, so

00:49.784 --> 00:51.316
why should we, right?

00:55.989 --> 00:57.723
- I'm ashamed of those days.

00:59.159 --> 01:00.993
I'm ashamed of myself, and
embarrassed.

01:02.028 --> 01:03.829
I feel like a failure.

01:29.055 --> 01:30.856
- Ah, new sheets!

01:30.858 --> 01:32.024
And they're grey.

01:32.026 --> 01:33.926
- Oh, no.

01:33.928 --> 01:36.161
We want color in a thousand
threat count!

01:36.163 --> 01:38.163
Go get feather pillows.

01:43.536 --> 01:44.503
Hi.

01:44.505 --> 01:46.505
I'll take these.

01:50.043 --> 01:51.043
Mm-mm.

01:53.613 --> 01:56.048
- That'll be $503.65.

01:57.317 --> 01:59.852
Thank you.

01:59.854 --> 02:01.720
Do you...

02:07.427 --> 02:10.829
- No, I do not.

02:10.830 --> 02:11.964
- Thank you.

02:11.966 --> 02:13.732
Have a nice day.

02:13.734 --> 02:15.000
- Don't I need to sign it?

02:15.002 --> 02:16.969
- You already did, ma'am.

02:16.971 --> 02:18.003
- Oh.

02:18.005 --> 02:20.072
Yes.

02:20.974 --> 02:22.207
Yes, I did.

02:22.209 --> 02:23.509
Thank you.

02:27.147 --> 02:28.013
- Ready?

02:28.015 --> 02:29.014
- Oh,

02:29.016 --> 02:30.816
yeah, I just need some ba-

02:35.822 --> 02:37.856
please tell me this is the
last thing we had to do.

02:37.858 --> 02:38.857
- That's it.

02:38.859 --> 02:40.299
- Okay, let's get back to your
house.

03:22.468 --> 03:24.136
Oh, you should've had those
ready.

03:24.138 --> 03:25.204
- Sorry, sorry.

05:11.844 --> 05:15.080
- Oh, I'm lost in candiland.

05:15.082 --> 05:18.250
If only my father were here to
help me!

05:19.353 --> 05:21.386
Oh, hi dad, how you doing?

05:21.388 --> 05:23.555
You're my father!

05:25.191 --> 05:26.658
- Seriously, Samson?

05:28.461 --> 05:30.195
Every time we get around dead
bodies

05:30.197 --> 05:31.830
you go all pre-school on me.

05:31.832 --> 05:33.432
Grow some balls.

05:33.434 --> 05:35.000
- Lighten up.

05:35.002 --> 05:36.601
Just trying to figure out their
mindset.

05:37.537 --> 05:38.704
Look at this place.

05:45.045 --> 05:47.379
Call from: God.

05:50.483 --> 05:51.917
- Peter, pick up the phone
please.

05:51.919 --> 05:53.518
I know you hear my voice, come
on.

05:55.188 --> 05:57.689
I'm beginning to know your
answering machine quite well

05:57.691 --> 05:59.224
this past month.
- If you don't talk

05:59.226 --> 06:01.693
to him, he's gonna come here.

06:01.695 --> 06:04.396
- This is your father
talking; That's an order.

06:06.200 --> 06:07.866
- Hello?

06:07.868 --> 06:09.868
Good dad, good.

06:09.870 --> 06:11.069
- Now, how's the knee?

06:11.071 --> 06:13.705
Uh, that's a stupid question.

06:13.707 --> 06:15.640
I just wanted to make sure
you're okay.

06:15.642 --> 06:16.875
That's all.

06:16.877 --> 06:19.611
- Yeah, yeah, I'm leaving
for england tomorrow.

06:19.613 --> 06:22.214
There's a chance I could
get to go on with them

06:22.216 --> 06:24.549
and do some promoting
on a world class level.

06:24.551 --> 06:26.385
Maybe a month.

06:26.387 --> 06:28.487
I've got everything taken
care of on this end.

06:30.256 --> 06:32.624
Well I made the contact
a long time ago, dad.

06:32.626 --> 06:34.259
It just came up.

06:34.261 --> 06:35.594
- Take care.

06:35.596 --> 06:37.496
And give my regards to the
queen.

06:39.967 --> 06:41.233
He's coming back.

06:47.408 --> 06:48.673
- Well hello there, neighbor.

06:48.675 --> 06:50.242
You wanted to see me?
- Yeah.

06:50.244 --> 06:51.244
Follow me.

06:54.514 --> 06:57.082
- It's not every day
that the elusive Arnie

06:57.084 --> 06:59.785
asks me over; It must
be a special occasion.

07:00.953 --> 07:02.687
- Here are your pie plates.

07:02.689 --> 07:04.423
Thanks for spoiling me.

07:04.425 --> 07:08.160
- Oh great, cause these
cost about 30 cents each.

07:08.162 --> 07:10.162
- I washed them.

07:15.067 --> 07:17.135
- You okay?
- - Yeah.

07:17.137 --> 07:18.870
- Is it your knee, do you need a
doctor?

07:18.872 --> 07:20.605
- No, no, no. It just clicks
sometimes.

07:21.874 --> 07:23.708
Just the way it's gonna have to
be.

07:23.710 --> 07:26.311
Could've been worse.

07:26.313 --> 07:28.346
- It's good to have a positive
attitude.

07:28.348 --> 07:30.048
- In fact, I never used to
believe in god.

07:30.050 --> 07:31.516
- Do you now?

07:32.218 --> 07:34.386
- What am I missing here, Arnie?

07:35.888 --> 07:37.522
What's the magic formula?

07:37.524 --> 07:39.224
Is it cherry?

07:39.226 --> 07:40.559
Blueberry?

07:40.561 --> 07:41.860
- All of the above.

07:41.862 --> 07:43.628
- Me, I just
have the book of Arnie.

07:43.630 --> 07:44.629
- What's that?

07:44.631 --> 07:46.331
- Let's see what psalm 14 has to
say.

07:48.035 --> 07:49.701
- I want you to know

07:49.703 --> 07:52.137
that drinking isn't the answer.

07:52.139 --> 07:54.072
Take it from me.

07:54.074 --> 07:55.874
It prolongs your depression.

07:55.876 --> 07:57.809
- Thou shalt not drink. Praise
Arnie.

07:57.811 --> 08:00.579
- How many pies has a
gal gotta bake before you

08:00.581 --> 08:02.714
take a hint and ask her out?

08:02.716 --> 08:04.182
Oh, because sooner or later

08:04.184 --> 08:06.017
she's gonna open up
her stupid mouth hoping

08:06.019 --> 08:08.420
that you'll rescue her.

08:08.422 --> 08:09.988
Please tell me you're following
me, Arnie.

08:09.990 --> 08:11.189
- You want to go out?

08:16.496 --> 08:19.064
- Pick me up at seven?

08:21.267 --> 08:22.834
- Yes ma'am.

08:28.140 --> 08:30.108
- We just grew apart.

08:30.110 --> 08:32.943
And now he thinks some cheap
advice is gonna fix everything.

08:34.113 --> 08:35.947
- Well he is not gonna be an
issue

08:35.948 --> 08:38.183
for the next little while, so i
think

08:38.184 --> 08:39.951
we should...

08:39.953 --> 08:42.453
Remove him from the apartment.

08:42.456 --> 08:43.922
- All messages deleted.

08:49.195 --> 08:51.062
- I'm half empty without you.

08:53.533 --> 08:55.600
Marines don't cry.

09:11.317 --> 09:12.617
You're all I got.

09:14.720 --> 09:16.922
And I love you so much.

09:20.393 --> 09:21.760
- Hi.
- - Hello.

09:23.329 --> 09:24.596
- New sheets!

09:32.171 --> 09:34.472
- Is it too early to
fall in love with you?

09:37.043 --> 09:39.144
Oh I'm sorry, I didn't
realize you were awake.

09:48.788 --> 09:51.990
- I've been here for so
long without going home.

09:51.992 --> 09:55.627
- Tess! Look at me.

09:55.629 --> 09:58.597
For the first time in
ages I meet someone who

09:58.599 --> 10:01.700
makes me feel at peace, and what
do I do?

10:01.702 --> 10:05.870
I get so excited...

10:07.273 --> 10:09.341
That I smother her.

10:18.784 --> 10:20.685
I'm really not like this.

10:22.622 --> 10:25.056
I'm just so happy.

10:25.058 --> 10:26.324
- I'm happy too.

10:29.829 --> 10:31.029
But there's...

10:34.433 --> 10:36.468
There's something about
me that you don't know.

10:39.639 --> 10:41.406
I can't have children.

10:44.610 --> 10:46.478
- That's it? You can't have
kids?

10:46.480 --> 10:48.246
- That's what...

10:48.248 --> 10:49.881
My scar is from.

10:52.184 --> 10:53.985
I was pregnant...

10:55.921 --> 10:58.323
Something went wrong so they
took it

10:58.325 --> 11:00.025
out of me, they...

11:01.460 --> 11:03.161
They took it all out of me.

11:03.163 --> 11:05.897
- Tess, I don't want kids.

11:05.899 --> 11:07.032
- You say that now.

11:07.034 --> 11:09.834
- Thought about it
upside down and sideways.

11:09.836 --> 11:11.036
No interest.

11:11.038 --> 11:13.271
- Charles wanted kids more than

11:13.273 --> 11:14.906
he wanted me.

11:14.908 --> 11:16.775
- Maybe he's the one
who's missing something.

11:18.477 --> 11:22.080
He let the perfect contessa

11:22.082 --> 11:23.782
slip through his fingers.

11:23.784 --> 11:25.350
- You think I'm perfect?

11:25.352 --> 11:27.519
- Oh, I love having you here.

11:33.492 --> 11:34.492
- That was...

11:35.961 --> 11:39.230
I've always felt like
I've been alone before.

11:39.232 --> 11:42.233
I think that's the first
time I've ever made love.

11:42.235 --> 11:44.369
- What's happening here?

11:44.371 --> 11:47.038
- I've never felt so close so
fast.

11:51.044 --> 11:53.311
- So how's the billster doing
with soccer?

11:53.313 --> 11:54.079
- Oh, pretty good.

11:54.081 --> 11:56.047
He's gotta hit the field more,
but uh,

11:56.049 --> 11:57.649
he's all obsessed with this blog
of his.

11:57.651 --> 11:59.918
- You gotta beat that art
shit right out of him.

12:00.686 --> 12:02.053
Trust me, you don't want him to
end up

12:02.055 --> 12:03.321
like one of these whack jobs.

12:06.659 --> 12:08.226
- It tickles!

12:10.763 --> 12:13.164
Is it a puppy dog?

12:14.033 --> 12:15.633
- Uh-uh.

12:17.036 --> 12:20.839
- Is it a truck?

12:20.841 --> 12:22.307
- Nope.

12:24.610 --> 12:26.945
- Is it a pair of pants?

12:26.947 --> 12:30.415
- Ha, wrong!

12:37.723 --> 12:40.191
Now press back,

12:40.193 --> 12:41.659
and hold still.

12:43.395 --> 12:44.796
- I can do that.

12:47.199 --> 12:49.100
- Can you now?

12:50.636 --> 12:52.337
- It's a cactus.

12:52.339 --> 12:54.472
- It's not a cactus!

12:56.275 --> 12:58.977
I think it looks like us.

12:58.979 --> 13:01.179
Our own little private
expression.

13:05.818 --> 13:07.218
- Uh-oh.

13:07.220 --> 13:09.721
But now the rest of the
place looks super bland.

13:12.158 --> 13:14.192
- Yeah!

13:14.194 --> 13:15.527
You're right!

13:15.529 --> 13:18.196
How dare this goddamn place be
so boring!

13:20.700 --> 13:23.535
- We have to fight against it!

13:23.537 --> 13:24.836
- Yeah!

13:32.812 --> 13:34.345
- Delivery, paint.

13:34.947 --> 13:36.481
- Just leave it.

13:36.483 --> 13:38.817
- I need a signature, please.

13:47.159 --> 13:48.893
This is all the...

13:50.462 --> 13:52.530
That we had left over.

13:52.865 --> 13:53.097
- Leave!

13:53.099 --> 13:54.532
- Pardon me?
- - Leave!

13:57.102 --> 13:58.102
- What about the Dolly?

13:58.104 --> 13:59.104
- Charge me.

14:00.806 --> 14:02.373
- Oh, I'm gonna charge you.

14:04.310 --> 14:05.743
- That's gonna dry like that.

14:05.745 --> 14:07.378
- Well...

14:07.380 --> 14:08.380
Who needs heat?

14:13.385 --> 14:15.753
- I feel like we need some
music.

14:15.755 --> 14:17.922
- Yeah, that's a fantastic idea.

14:31.403 --> 14:33.238
- I'm starting to believe in
god.

14:33.240 --> 14:35.240
- Really?

14:35.242 --> 14:37.242
- I think you're god.

14:37.244 --> 14:38.877
- Then you must me god too.

14:41.248 --> 14:43.047
That means that I can
actually learn about god

14:43.049 --> 14:44.382
by studying you.

14:44.384 --> 14:45.650
- That's gonna take a long time.

14:45.652 --> 14:46.584
- Shh!

14:46.586 --> 14:47.719
There is no time in here!

14:47.721 --> 14:49.454
- What do you mean, there's
no time in your apartment?

14:49.456 --> 14:53.391
- This is...

14:53.393 --> 14:54.759
Candiland.

14:54.761 --> 14:59.330
&k there goes my heart

14:59.332 --> 15:01.266
&k it goes... &k

15:01.268 --> 15:04.302
no calendars, no clocks, no
time.

15:04.304 --> 15:06.104
- No more social media
judgements.

15:06.106 --> 15:07.572
- Mm-mm.

15:07.574 --> 15:09.507
- I'll do it if you do it.

15:09.509 --> 15:11.609
- I'll do it.

15:11.611 --> 15:14.112
I'm doing it!

15:16.449 --> 15:20.184
&k there goes my heart &k

15:20.186 --> 15:24.289
- I am king Peter, and
you are queen contessa!

15:27.626 --> 15:29.427
- I love you.

15:29.429 --> 15:30.628
- I love you too.

15:50.884 --> 15:52.817
- The citizens
of candiland are not safe.

15:55.322 --> 16:00.325
- No one is a match for
the 50 foot librarian!

16:06.533 --> 16:07.732
- The army is in its way!

16:07.734 --> 16:09.334
We're gonna take her down,
that's what we're gonna do.

16:09.336 --> 16:10.702
We're gonna throw
everything we've got at her.

16:10.704 --> 16:12.804
If she thinks that she
can come to our city

16:12.806 --> 16:14.572
and, oh no, she's coming!

16:32.691 --> 16:34.492
- I am coming for you.

16:46.773 --> 16:50.908
- We meet again, gigantor man!

16:50.910 --> 16:54.912
You really think you can handle
this?

16:56.383 --> 16:59.350
- I came here to bend you over
the bed.

17:05.790 --> 17:07.392
- I can't kiss you!

17:07.394 --> 17:08.859
I can't kiss you.

17:12.799 --> 17:14.531
Aw, your nose!

17:15.534 --> 17:19.037
- Malfunction, malfunction.

17:24.910 --> 17:26.944
- What is our purpose?

17:26.945 --> 17:29.714
I mean, if we are god, and well,

17:29.716 --> 17:31.816
we are...

17:31.818 --> 17:34.118
Who are we helping,
because isn't the meaning

17:34.120 --> 17:35.720
of life to help others?

17:37.689 --> 17:40.224
- Well we're helping each other.

17:40.226 --> 17:41.492
- I guess so.

17:44.396 --> 17:46.097
- Well...

17:46.099 --> 17:48.132
Maybe we need to help each other
first,

17:48.134 --> 17:50.568
and then we'll figure
out how to help others.

17:50.570 --> 17:53.604
We need to meld together first.

17:53.606 --> 17:55.506
Become as close as possible.

18:05.184 --> 18:06.184
- Peter...

18:07.686 --> 18:08.686
- Hm?

18:11.090 --> 18:12.356
- Will you marry me?

18:15.727 --> 18:16.794
- Right now?

18:16.796 --> 18:18.996
Absolutely, of course!

18:18.998 --> 18:20.498
What do you mean, like the
merging of two dualities?

18:20.500 --> 18:21.933
Should we do it right now?

18:21.935 --> 18:23.134
- No, no, no I think we should

18:23.136 --> 18:25.703
think about it, and then do it
right.

18:27.239 --> 18:29.140
- Well, okay, so how should we
do it then?

18:30.375 --> 18:33.177
- Um, well we have to write our
vows.

18:48.060 --> 18:49.160
- He's not there?

18:49.162 --> 18:50.194
Thank you, sir.

18:52.564 --> 18:54.132
- Okay, enough with the phone.

18:56.101 --> 18:57.835
- England's got a lot of hotels.

18:57.837 --> 18:59.370
- If he wanted you to
have his phone number,

18:59.372 --> 19:00.372
he would've called you.

19:04.676 --> 19:05.743
- You ready?

19:08.280 --> 19:10.148
- Yes!

19:10.150 --> 19:11.150
Okay.

19:14.186 --> 19:15.353
Ta-da!

19:15.355 --> 19:16.420
- Wow.

19:16.422 --> 19:18.856
- Peter needs to get
back on the right track,

19:18.858 --> 19:20.491
and I am what he needs.

19:20.493 --> 19:22.693
- No, he needs to jump out of
the nest.

19:22.695 --> 19:24.228
He needs to spread his wings.

19:24.230 --> 19:27.365
He doesn't need his father
telling him what to do.

19:27.367 --> 19:29.167
- Where are your papers and
everything?

19:29.169 --> 19:30.268
- Mm, shh.

19:33.639 --> 19:38.609
King Peter, I want to live here

19:38.611 --> 19:42.780
in candiland with you

19:42.782 --> 19:44.949
forever.
- Hold it!

19:44.951 --> 19:47.618
I'm not just his father,
I'm his everything.

19:47.620 --> 19:48.920
- Wow.
- - Yes wow.

19:48.922 --> 19:51.189
- So you smothered the poor
boy, and now you're gonna

19:51.191 --> 19:53.090
fix everything by smothering him
again?

19:53.092 --> 19:56.194
- Queen Tessa...

19:56.196 --> 20:00.231
I wanna live here with you

20:00.233 --> 20:03.434
in candiland forever.

20:03.436 --> 20:05.203
- What I'm telling you is-

20:05.205 --> 20:07.104
- you just want to be in
control.

20:07.106 --> 20:09.240
- Is that you, Arnie?
- - Yes.

20:09.242 --> 20:10.908
- Well...

20:12.244 --> 20:14.979
You don't always have to be the
leader.

20:14.981 --> 20:16.781
- And so we are one.

20:20.752 --> 20:23.754
- Maybe you should try
following.

20:23.756 --> 20:26.824
- Yes ma'am.

20:35.067 --> 20:36.667
- I love you, Peter.

20:44.477 --> 20:46.444
Good morning, honey lover.

21:16.975 --> 21:19.810
- Did I notice any strange
smells?

21:20.579 --> 21:23.481
You know I live right next
to the garbage chute, right?

21:23.483 --> 21:25.449
And I work at a chemical plant.

21:25.451 --> 21:27.652
And my girlfriend's an escort.

21:27.654 --> 21:29.687
So I'm kinda, like,

21:29.689 --> 21:31.188
used to weird smells.

21:31.190 --> 21:33.124
- Okay, well did you
notice anything unusual

21:33.126 --> 21:34.859
from the guy living in 619?

21:34.861 --> 21:36.821
- Nah, he seemed like a
pretty cool dude actually.

21:41.300 --> 21:42.967
- Peter, can you hear me?

21:45.470 --> 21:47.338
- I'm worried about my knee.

21:47.340 --> 21:49.974
- Well, there are surgical
procedures that we can do, but

21:49.976 --> 21:51.676
nothing is 100%.

21:52.912 --> 21:55.346
We can help you get your
quality of life back though.

21:55.348 --> 21:56.681
- Will any of these things
result in me

21:56.683 --> 21:58.015
playing tennis again?

21:58.017 --> 21:59.817
- No.

22:00.452 --> 22:01.519
No.

22:01.521 --> 22:03.054
I know you don't want to believe
this, but

22:03.056 --> 22:04.655
you're a lucky man.

22:04.657 --> 22:06.324
- But tennis is all I have.

22:06.326 --> 22:08.392
- Cold.

22:08.394 --> 22:10.227
Well you're gonna have to
start looking at the world

22:10.229 --> 22:12.229
a little bit differently, Peter.

22:12.231 --> 22:14.498
You look around,

22:14.500 --> 22:16.267
you'll find something worth
living for.

22:16.269 --> 22:17.668
- And that's it?

22:17.670 --> 22:19.270
- Yes, you hear me Peter?

22:19.272 --> 22:20.838
- There's nothing else you can
do for me?

22:20.840 --> 22:23.207
- There is one thing, doctor.

22:23.209 --> 22:25.876
- Yes, yes there is one thing.

22:25.878 --> 22:28.412
One thing that will solve
all of your problems,

22:28.414 --> 22:30.548
get you back on the court by
Monday.

22:30.550 --> 22:32.016
- Really, what is it?

22:32.018 --> 22:33.751
Please tell me, I'll try
anything.

22:33.753 --> 22:36.887
- It's the fresh scent of
bright beam laundry detergent.

22:36.889 --> 22:39.290
Oh, nothing leaves a softer-

22:42.361 --> 22:43.794
&k bright beam &k

22:45.163 --> 22:46.764
- bright beam laundry detergent.

22:46.766 --> 22:48.432
Nothing gets your clothes...

23:02.915 --> 23:03.981
- Peter?

23:03.983 --> 23:05.216
What's going on?

23:05.218 --> 23:06.384
- Nothing.

23:06.386 --> 23:07.918
The television broke.

23:07.920 --> 23:09.153
It's nothing.

23:10.822 --> 23:11.822
And who needs it.

23:13.558 --> 23:15.393
Who needs time?

23:17.429 --> 23:19.930
Force me into some pointless
routine.

23:19.932 --> 23:22.933
I'm not a slave to schedule
anymore!

23:25.837 --> 23:27.271
- Hey!

23:27.273 --> 23:28.973
Hey, what the fuck man?

23:28.975 --> 23:33.177
Hey, you can't leave your
fucking shitty TV here, man.

23:33.179 --> 23:34.445
What the fuck?

23:34.447 --> 23:35.746
Hey!

23:35.748 --> 23:37.948
I'm calling the manager, fuck
face.

23:37.950 --> 23:39.316
Hey man, come on.

23:39.318 --> 23:41.252
- Someone will take the set
away.

23:41.254 --> 23:42.787
It's not that big a deal.

23:42.789 --> 23:44.588
- Let's just have a little
conversation about you

23:44.590 --> 23:46.257
and where you place your
TV man, that's it man.

23:46.259 --> 23:49.260
Just me and you and my fist in
your face.

23:49.262 --> 23:51.028
- Guy's probably got a
list of sins a mile long

23:51.030 --> 23:53.197
but he's Mr. consumatic!

23:53.199 --> 23:57.435
Screaming like a jackass
at another human being!

23:57.437 --> 23:59.170
- You got some serious fucking
issues.

23:59.172 --> 23:59.770
You know what?

23:59.772 --> 24:01.038
I'm gonna keep this fucking
clock.

24:01.040 --> 24:02.106
This is fucking mine.

24:05.278 --> 24:06.877
- I don't want to go out there.

24:09.247 --> 24:10.614
- All the way up and
down this fucking hallway

24:10.616 --> 24:12.116
you piece of shit!

24:12.118 --> 24:13.317
Fucking asshole.

24:15.521 --> 24:16.521
Dick.

24:16.755 --> 24:17.822
- It'll go away.

24:23.662 --> 24:25.963
- What's it like for you
not being able to have kids?

24:27.232 --> 24:29.800
- I feel...

24:29.802 --> 24:30.802
Broken.

24:33.104 --> 24:37.074
I feel trapped

24:37.076 --> 24:40.077
inside the body that killed my
baby.

24:44.282 --> 24:45.549
- Tess...

24:45.551 --> 24:48.519
You are the most beautiful woman

24:48.521 --> 24:50.054
that I've ever met.

24:52.091 --> 24:54.091
- I'm hideous.

24:54.093 --> 24:56.160
- You're gorgeous.

24:56.162 --> 24:57.828
You have a beautiful face,

24:57.830 --> 24:59.830
and a painfully sexy body.

25:06.838 --> 25:10.441
- You're the first person to
ever make me feel attractive.

25:11.676 --> 25:15.846
- Well, you've been with the
wrong people.

25:15.848 --> 25:18.182
You are the perfect woman.

25:18.184 --> 25:21.418
And these...

25:21.420 --> 25:23.053
Are the perfect breasts.

25:23.055 --> 25:25.523
- They don't feel perfect.

25:25.525 --> 25:26.757
- What do they feel like?

25:29.060 --> 25:31.428
- Tombstones.

25:31.430 --> 25:33.197
I miss my baby.

25:35.901 --> 25:38.302
How do you miss someone that

25:38.304 --> 25:40.571
you've never even met?

25:40.573 --> 25:42.373
- It's okay, Tess.

25:42.375 --> 25:44.542
You can let it out.

25:44.544 --> 25:45.976
I'm here.

26:00.626 --> 26:02.426
- Don't make me break this door
down.

26:02.428 --> 26:04.061
I've been the nobel's office.

26:04.063 --> 26:05.896
Food is delivered here every
week.

26:05.898 --> 26:07.498
- Is this how my night's
gonna go right now?

26:07.500 --> 26:09.567
I'm just gonna have people
yelling at every goddamn door?

26:09.569 --> 26:11.335
Can I help you, man?

26:11.337 --> 26:12.636
- Get back in there.

26:12.638 --> 26:13.437
- The fuck is going on here?

26:13.439 --> 26:14.405
- Stay in there!

26:14.407 --> 26:15.606
- I'm calling the cops you
motherfucker!

26:15.608 --> 26:17.508
- Call 'em, dummy.

26:17.510 --> 26:20.177
- You can't even live
your own life, old man!

26:20.179 --> 26:21.946
- You don't know what's going on
anymore!

26:21.948 --> 26:23.614
- The second I find happiness

26:23.616 --> 26:25.783
here you are desperate to take
it away.

26:25.785 --> 26:27.484
- Peter, come on, this is your
father.

26:27.486 --> 26:29.353
- Well not this time!

26:30.589 --> 26:31.655
- Hm.

26:31.657 --> 26:34.858
- I am a legal adult now,

26:34.860 --> 26:38.262
and there ain't a goddamn
thing that you can do

26:38.264 --> 26:40.364
to get into this place.

26:40.366 --> 26:41.865
- I like that, I like that
attitude.

26:41.867 --> 26:43.767
- I hate you!

26:43.769 --> 26:46.036
- For god's sake.

26:46.038 --> 26:47.371
- I hate you, and i
don't want anything ever

26:47.373 --> 26:49.640
to do with you ever again.

26:49.642 --> 26:51.842
- I'm dismissed.

27:07.892 --> 27:09.026
- I'm free now.

27:11.630 --> 27:13.497
You answered my prayers.

27:45.330 --> 27:46.730
- Did you get it?

27:46.732 --> 27:47.732
- What?

27:53.304 --> 27:55.005
Did I get what? What're you
talking about?

27:57.308 --> 27:59.276
You asked me if I got it.

27:59.278 --> 28:00.878
What did I get?

28:00.880 --> 28:03.180
- I'm sorry Peter, I just woke
up.

28:03.182 --> 28:05.716
I must've been dreaming or
something.

28:05.718 --> 28:09.586
Peter moping so long!

28:10.221 --> 28:12.856
- Sorry. I upset dad.

28:14.159 --> 28:15.559
- Yeah?

28:15.561 --> 28:17.561
He's gone!

28:17.563 --> 28:20.898
Been long gone since a long
time.

28:20.900 --> 28:23.434
What would you like for...

28:24.669 --> 28:26.437
Food time?

28:26.439 --> 28:28.405
Ooh!

28:28.407 --> 28:29.273
Need help?

28:29.275 --> 28:30.541
- No.

28:31.009 --> 28:32.776
Cookies.

28:32.778 --> 28:34.278
- Perfect.

28:37.483 --> 28:38.749
Oopsie!

28:48.961 --> 28:50.227
- Tess!

28:50.229 --> 28:51.595
What is it?

28:51.597 --> 28:52.796
- I saw it, I saw it.

28:52.798 --> 28:53.897
- Saw what?

28:53.899 --> 28:55.232
- The date.

28:55.234 --> 28:58.669
The date was on the receipt.

28:58.671 --> 29:00.337
The time, I saw the time.

29:00.339 --> 29:01.839
- I know.

29:01.841 --> 29:03.307
- You do?
- - Yes.

29:05.610 --> 29:06.510
- We communicate...

29:06.512 --> 29:07.845
- Without talking.

29:13.619 --> 29:17.121
- I miss not knowing that it's
march 21st.

29:17.123 --> 29:18.455
- Hey...

29:21.426 --> 29:23.293
Gone.

29:24.729 --> 29:26.296
Here.

29:26.298 --> 29:27.965
Replaced.

29:32.403 --> 29:33.771
- What're we doing here?

29:33.773 --> 29:35.038
- Making a statement.

29:36.608 --> 29:37.641
- What's that?

29:37.643 --> 29:40.043
- That life can be giggles and
crunch.

29:40.045 --> 29:41.712
Giggles and crunch?

29:43.114 --> 29:44.782
- Squiggles and scrunch!

29:44.784 --> 29:45.883
- Squiggles and scrunch!

29:45.885 --> 29:48.452
- Squiggles and scrunch!

29:52.557 --> 29:53.724
- Where's that water coming
from?

29:53.726 --> 29:55.626
- It's slow leak from the
ceiling.

29:55.628 --> 29:57.561
Looks like they tried to
stuff paper in it to plug it.

29:57.563 --> 29:58.962
It's just mush now.

30:01.266 --> 30:04.701
- Do you ever wonder if they're
happy?

30:04.703 --> 30:07.805
I mean now that they're not
secretly sneaking around

30:07.807 --> 30:11.008
behind everyone's backs,
where's the excitement?

30:11.010 --> 30:12.576
I mean, would it be gone?

30:12.578 --> 30:14.211
Because they have now
had to make the switch

30:14.213 --> 30:16.313
from being irresponsible
to being responsible,

30:16.315 --> 30:18.382
and I don't think that Charles
could be

30:18.384 --> 30:20.384
that kind of a husband
to someone, you know?

30:20.386 --> 30:22.085
He's always gonna wanna
be distracted by other

30:22.087 --> 30:25.222
things, and not really giving
his whole...

30:25.224 --> 30:28.926
- You know, I don't want to
hear about Charles anymore.

30:28.928 --> 30:30.561
- But you keep asking me
questions.

30:30.563 --> 30:32.496
- And they all lead you
to talking about him

30:32.498 --> 30:34.865
and I'm sick and tired
of hearing his name.

30:34.867 --> 30:38.068
- Well he was kind of
a big part of my life-

30:38.070 --> 30:40.337
- I know, I know, I know!

30:40.339 --> 30:42.439
I know. I know.

30:42.441 --> 30:44.174
But he's not anymore.

30:45.510 --> 30:48.445
And I'm sick and tired of
thinking about his hands on you.

30:48.447 --> 30:50.247
I want us to forget about that
time.

30:51.549 --> 30:54.685
All of our energy should
be put into today.

30:54.687 --> 30:55.953
Into us.

30:55.955 --> 30:59.289
- My past is a big part of who i
am.

30:59.291 --> 31:00.524
- I know my darling, but let's
just

31:00.526 --> 31:02.559
say that history molded you
into the wonderful person

31:02.561 --> 31:04.962
that you are, and be done with
it.

31:04.964 --> 31:06.196
- But...

31:06.198 --> 31:08.298
No, all week all we've been
talking about

31:08.300 --> 31:10.734
is me, we haven't talked about
you at all.

31:12.738 --> 31:14.538
- There's nothing worth knowing,
really.

31:14.540 --> 31:16.106
- No fair!

31:16.108 --> 31:16.974
Uh-uh.

31:16.976 --> 31:19.309
You haven't told me anything
about...

31:21.312 --> 31:23.313
The accident.
- Ah.

31:31.890 --> 31:33.657
I'm sorry.

31:36.728 --> 31:38.729
Car hops the curb and nails me.

31:41.432 --> 31:43.567
It was a drunk idiot.

31:43.569 --> 31:45.302
Totally his fault.

31:46.604 --> 31:48.972
And I got a huge cash
settlement.

31:48.974 --> 31:52.009
But still, everyone else managed
to

31:52.011 --> 31:53.744
get out of his way.

31:55.247 --> 31:56.680
Except for me,

31:56.682 --> 31:57.814
the tennis pro.

32:00.218 --> 32:01.218
- Babe...

32:08.293 --> 32:10.260
- And that was that.

32:13.097 --> 32:14.698
I love you, Tess.

32:14.700 --> 32:16.667
- I love you, Peter.

32:16.669 --> 32:19.336
- I want to wash my
past away from my hands.

32:19.338 --> 32:22.005
I want you to wash your past
away too.

32:22.007 --> 32:23.140
Can you do that for me?

32:26.811 --> 32:27.844
- Okay.

32:33.785 --> 32:35.652
No more past.

32:35.654 --> 32:37.487
- I don't know Donnie,
it's been like 10 years

32:37.489 --> 32:38.956
since I've been out dancing.

32:38.958 --> 32:40.390
Charles never-
- uh-uh.

32:40.392 --> 32:42.392
Tonight has nothing to do with
Charles.

32:42.394 --> 32:44.294
- It isn't even final yet!

32:44.296 --> 32:45.462
- It is for him!

32:45.464 --> 32:47.331
I mean, Jesus, he already
shacked up with that

32:47.333 --> 32:50.400
blonde slut, spending his
nights-

32:50.402 --> 32:52.703
- it's not like I'm
gonna have revenge sex.

32:52.705 --> 32:54.705
- Right, you should
totally deny yourself sex,

32:54.707 --> 32:56.406
that way it will teach him a
lesson.

32:58.576 --> 33:00.744
- I can't believe you
talked me into this skirt.

33:00.746 --> 33:01.812
This skirt is ridiculous.

33:01.814 --> 33:03.080
- Your ass is ridiculous!

33:08.786 --> 33:09.886
Smile, pretty girl!

33:12.457 --> 33:13.991
Oh my god, you look so pretty!

33:15.960 --> 33:17.761
- So how're you supposed to meet
someone

33:17.763 --> 33:19.830
when you have to shout to talk?

33:19.832 --> 33:22.399
- No, no, it's not about
talking.

33:22.401 --> 33:25.569
Just be, go like this, go
like this: Just like...

33:25.571 --> 33:27.037
You're just looking around,

33:27.039 --> 33:30.440
you're having fun, it's
just so much fun to be here.

33:38.149 --> 33:40.050
Okay, it's never worked that
fast before.

33:40.052 --> 33:41.184
Bye!

33:41.186 --> 33:43.086
Excuse me ladies, pardon me,
sorry.

33:44.722 --> 33:46.723
Oh my god, the lighting is
so much better over here.

33:46.725 --> 33:48.458
Isn't it? Hi, I'm Donnie.

33:48.460 --> 33:49.893
I'm not even high yet.

34:00.505 --> 34:01.271
- What'll you have?

34:01.273 --> 34:03.940
- I'll try a shot of that
picaberry blue.

34:03.942 --> 34:06.309
- No, no, no, get her something
different.

34:06.311 --> 34:08.245
Anything else she wants, just
not that.

34:09.647 --> 34:11.648
- You look a little
young to buy me a drink.

34:16.821 --> 34:19.222
- Tess, stop.

34:19.224 --> 34:21.224
- Bye Donnie.

34:21.226 --> 34:24.594
Thank you for introducing
me to the man of my dreams.

34:24.596 --> 34:26.630
- Honey, you don't have to do
this.

34:26.632 --> 34:28.465
There's a way for you to keep
Peter

34:28.467 --> 34:30.833
and your sanity, all you have
to...

34:32.071 --> 34:33.737
All you have to do is...

34:39.077 --> 34:40.510
- Goodbye Charles.

34:40.512 --> 34:42.245
I hope it hurts.

34:42.246 --> 34:43.746
Sometimes.

35:04.803 --> 35:06.303
- What? What's going on?

35:06.305 --> 35:08.672
- Peter, Peter, Peter.

35:08.674 --> 35:10.774
I love you, I love you.

35:10.776 --> 35:13.677
I just want to be here and
now, just like you said.

35:13.679 --> 35:16.947
Just us forever and
ever and ever and ever.

35:23.554 --> 35:25.021
- Comfy!
- - Out.

35:25.023 --> 35:26.990
- Why?
- - Out!

35:26.992 --> 35:28.658
- Where?
- - Bathroom.

35:28.660 --> 35:29.392
- Hurry!

35:29.394 --> 35:30.560
- Yes.

35:44.675 --> 35:48.245
- Why do you
terrorize yourself so much?

35:53.751 --> 35:56.019
- Oh, oh, oh, settle.

35:56.021 --> 35:57.854
- I'm comfy.
- - Settle.

36:01.792 --> 36:03.059
Peter?

36:04.428 --> 36:05.929
Looser.

36:05.931 --> 36:06.997
- Why?

36:06.999 --> 36:08.265
- Loose!

36:08.267 --> 36:09.833
- Comfy!
- - Up.

36:09.835 --> 36:11.034
- Where?
- - Bathroom.

36:11.036 --> 36:11.735
- No!

36:11.737 --> 36:12.869
- Yes!

36:13.271 --> 36:14.704
- Me too?

36:16.707 --> 36:18.241
- Okay, come.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.910
Peter...

36:55.046 --> 36:57.614
No, you're too close!

37:02.186 --> 37:03.887
I mean always.

37:11.095 --> 37:14.798
Sorry, terrible sorry, so sorry.

37:14.800 --> 37:16.399
- Die.

37:18.936 --> 37:21.171
- Please no.

37:21.173 --> 37:23.240
No, petey, petey.

37:23.242 --> 37:24.341
I love you so!

37:27.678 --> 37:28.678
Peter?

37:29.513 --> 37:32.482
- Kitchen.
- Me too?

37:32.484 --> 37:33.683
- Come then.

37:54.039 --> 37:56.640
Call from: God.

37:58.343 --> 37:59.542
- You can coach,

37:59.544 --> 38:01.311
you can go back to school.

38:01.313 --> 38:03.046
We'll find something together.

38:04.148 --> 38:05.682
We'll figure this out.

38:07.151 --> 38:08.952
- Your ass is ridiculous!

38:48.426 --> 38:49.426
Hey.

38:55.132 --> 38:56.199
Hey you!

38:57.335 --> 38:59.035
Mind if I take a peek?

39:15.986 --> 39:17.387
- What're you having?

39:17.389 --> 39:19.122
- I will have anything.

39:19.124 --> 39:20.957
And I mean anything

39:20.959 --> 39:23.760
other than that picaberry
bullshit whatever.

39:23.762 --> 39:24.961
- Don't like sweet drinks?

39:24.963 --> 39:26.396
- Just that I don't like
being told what to drink

39:26.398 --> 39:28.264
while I try and take a piss.

39:28.266 --> 39:30.133
But that's too much to ask
for nowadays, ain't it?

39:30.135 --> 39:31.434
- I suppose.

39:31.436 --> 39:33.303
Try this on.

39:36.507 --> 39:37.440
- What'll you have?

39:37.442 --> 39:39.909
- I'll try a shot of that
picaberry blue.

39:39.911 --> 39:40.744
- No, no, no.

39:40.746 --> 39:42.579
Get her something different.

39:42.581 --> 39:44.447
Anything else she wants, just
not that.

39:45.916 --> 39:47.717
- You look a little
young to buy me a drink.

39:49.920 --> 39:51.488
- What's your name?

39:51.490 --> 39:53.390
- Tess.

39:53.392 --> 39:55.091
- Tess.

39:55.693 --> 39:57.293
Contessa.

39:57.295 --> 39:58.962
Tessa.

39:58.964 --> 40:00.330
- One more.

40:04.002 --> 40:05.402
- Bye bye, I gotta cut out.

40:05.404 --> 40:07.737
- Oh, we have to go already?

40:07.739 --> 40:10.273
- Uh, yeah right no.

40:10.275 --> 40:13.243
We...

40:20.351 --> 40:21.084
- You look great together!

40:21.086 --> 40:22.585
What a nice couple!

40:22.587 --> 40:24.988
Oh my gosh you look like his
mom.

40:24.990 --> 40:26.289
- Shut up!

40:27.358 --> 40:30.193
- Oh my gosh, I hear that
young man's got a car.

40:30.195 --> 40:31.528
Good for you.

40:37.335 --> 40:40.136
Sometimes it feels like...

40:40.138 --> 40:42.338
Wow.

40:49.213 --> 40:50.647
- Ow.

40:58.823 --> 41:00.056
What number do you live in?

41:00.058 --> 41:01.991
- I don't know, just pick a
door.

41:03.895 --> 41:07.397
- What number do you live in?

41:07.399 --> 41:09.866
- I don't even know if
this is the right building.

41:12.336 --> 41:13.970
- Wait, wait, stop!

41:13.972 --> 41:14.871
- What?

41:14.873 --> 41:16.172
- I don't know your name.

41:16.174 --> 41:18.241
What is your name?
- Peter.

41:18.243 --> 41:19.542
- Peter.

41:19.544 --> 41:21.377
Okay, you may resume.

41:21.379 --> 41:24.814
Oh Peter.

41:24.816 --> 41:25.982
Peter!

41:25.984 --> 41:27.550
- What?

41:27.552 --> 41:28.485
- What's going on?

41:28.487 --> 41:31.087
You're sitting there like there's
something you want to say.

41:31.089 --> 41:32.422
- Thinking.

41:32.424 --> 41:34.224
- Share.

41:34.226 --> 41:35.825
- No.

41:35.827 --> 41:37.360
- Well I need an outlet.

41:37.362 --> 41:39.596
You can take all of this stuff
and you can

41:39.598 --> 41:41.831
compose it in your head, but...

41:42.833 --> 41:44.601
I need something else.

41:52.009 --> 41:53.042
- Outlet.

42:11.328 --> 42:12.695
- Read?

42:12.697 --> 42:13.796
- Why?

42:13.798 --> 42:14.798
- Oneness.

42:20.905 --> 42:22.105
- My Peter.

42:26.243 --> 42:27.577
Okay?

42:27.579 --> 42:28.579
- Uh-huh.

42:38.456 --> 42:39.656
- Petey?

42:39.658 --> 42:40.990
- Hm?

42:43.093 --> 42:44.827
- I'm devoted to you.

42:47.064 --> 42:48.464
I love you so.

43:37.314 --> 43:40.650
- Why do you terrorize
yourself so much in your sleep?

43:46.390 --> 43:48.324
- Why do you
keep wrecking candiland?

43:48.326 --> 43:51.060
- Because you seek perfection.

43:51.062 --> 43:55.298
- Guilt is an end you
dissect in my every word

43:55.300 --> 43:57.967
looking for something
that you can lord over me.

43:57.969 --> 43:59.669
- Do you think I want to be
saved?

43:59.671 --> 44:03.172
- Once you believe that the
bad dreams will go away.

44:03.174 --> 44:06.409
- Why am I here?

44:08.612 --> 44:11.481
You don't dare answer that
question.

44:11.483 --> 44:13.916
Do you?

44:14.585 --> 44:16.586
Do you?

44:21.792 --> 44:22.425
- What're you doing,

44:22.427 --> 44:24.093
you're just whispering to me in
my sleep?

44:24.095 --> 44:26.329
- Happy thoughts, petey!

44:26.997 --> 44:28.998
Just wanting closeness.

44:49.053 --> 44:49.919
Petey?

44:49.921 --> 44:51.521
- Not ready.

44:51.523 --> 44:52.789
- I miss you so much.

44:52.791 --> 44:53.791
- I...

44:55.959 --> 44:57.460
- Please...

45:58.856 --> 46:00.757
- Oh, stinky.

46:02.126 --> 46:03.693
Please.

46:03.695 --> 46:04.594
- No.

46:04.596 --> 46:06.796
- Stinky!

46:06.798 --> 46:08.765
Please, needs cleaning!

46:09.800 --> 46:11.768
- Cleansing?

46:11.770 --> 46:12.802
- Yes!

46:12.804 --> 46:17.707
Stinky place needs cleaning.

46:17.709 --> 46:19.842
- Yes.

46:19.844 --> 46:21.310
You need cleansing.

46:24.114 --> 46:27.049
This is candiland,

46:27.051 --> 46:29.786
and in candiland there is
all the time in the world.

46:34.292 --> 46:36.526
I want to wash my past away from
my hands.

46:37.161 --> 46:39.662
I want you to wash your past
away too.

46:39.664 --> 46:41.664
Can you do that for me?

46:41.666 --> 46:44.233
- It's not your
fault that I died inside you.

46:44.235 --> 46:45.802
It was my fault.

46:45.804 --> 46:47.904
If only I could've been
someone you could like.

46:54.478 --> 46:56.345
- You locked the door!

46:56.347 --> 46:58.581
- I'm sorry, so sorry.

47:01.084 --> 47:03.052
- Who hurt my contessa?

47:08.426 --> 47:09.926
- My poor Tess.

47:09.928 --> 47:11.761
- Fix it!

47:16.600 --> 47:18.534
- There.

47:18.536 --> 47:20.736
- My king.

47:20.738 --> 47:24.073
- Now they'll all worship you,

47:24.075 --> 47:28.711
and you will rule over
them forever and ever.

47:28.713 --> 47:31.614
And they will never curse you...

47:33.150 --> 47:34.183
Again.

47:41.024 --> 47:42.925
- But after a day,

47:42.927 --> 47:45.027
what is a day?

47:45.029 --> 47:48.297
But with some reflection,
i always understand

47:48.299 --> 47:50.032
his motives.

47:50.034 --> 47:53.903
Perhaps that is where I'm meant
to be.

47:53.905 --> 47:56.038
It'll help make sure everyone
understands

47:56.040 --> 47:57.440
what I am writing.

47:59.877 --> 48:01.244
What am I writing?

48:02.813 --> 48:06.449
If Peter is god, and
this is an experiment...

48:09.052 --> 48:12.221
Then what I'm writing is...

48:16.828 --> 48:18.060
Peter!

48:19.596 --> 48:21.631
We're saints!

48:21.633 --> 48:25.801
And, and maybe you're the
Messiah!

48:26.603 --> 48:31.674
And these together,
they illustrate it all.

48:34.077 --> 48:35.645
They're a new gospel.

48:38.181 --> 48:39.248
Together?

48:44.922 --> 48:45.922
- Together.

48:53.364 --> 48:55.364
Call from: God.

48:57.134 --> 48:59.368
- He's leaving a message.

49:01.472 --> 49:04.640
Call from: God.

49:04.642 --> 49:05.875
- Hello?

49:05.877 --> 49:05.875
- God, my boy,
it's good to hear you voice.

49:05.877 --> 49:09.946
Listen, do you think we might be
able

49:09.948 --> 49:11.347
to get together sometime?

49:11.349 --> 49:14.050
- No, no, no, no, no!

49:20.424 --> 49:23.392
- Okay, so you're the new
Messiah.

49:23.394 --> 49:24.493
- Not yet.

49:25.829 --> 49:26.829
Not yet.

49:27.965 --> 49:31.033
We're not cleansed yet.

49:31.035 --> 49:32.168
We're not ready.

49:38.575 --> 49:40.376
- He says cleansed a lot.

49:41.812 --> 49:44.347
I can't remember the
last time I saw him eat.

49:44.349 --> 49:47.016
He's seeking some form of
enlightenment.

49:47.018 --> 49:48.985
If I am to be a good wife,

49:48.987 --> 49:50.386
if I am to be a Saint,

49:50.388 --> 49:52.588
I need to find a way to join
him.

49:52.590 --> 49:55.992
- Oh wow, Arnie!

49:55.994 --> 49:58.394
I didn't know you were
so good with your hands.

49:58.396 --> 50:00.162
- When you're in the marine
corps

50:00.164 --> 50:02.598
you learn how to tenderize the
feet

50:02.600 --> 50:05.334
for the marching and the combat.

50:16.646 --> 50:19.215
You know, when Peter turned
pro we were on the road

50:19.217 --> 50:21.617
a lot, and I didn't want
something like

50:21.619 --> 50:24.620
a sore shoulder to slow us down.

50:24.622 --> 50:27.923
I know he's all I talk about.

50:27.925 --> 50:29.892
- More like obsess about.

50:31.028 --> 50:33.295
- It's just hard to shake off.

50:33.297 --> 50:36.766
All that time building a
perfect future for my boy,

50:36.768 --> 50:37.900
and it's gone.

50:48.578 --> 50:50.479
- I cleaned for you.

50:50.481 --> 50:52.882
- You peeked.
- - Peeked?

50:54.384 --> 50:56.152
At your drawings?

50:56.154 --> 50:57.219
No I didn't.

50:57.221 --> 50:58.221
- You did.

51:00.257 --> 51:01.624
- Trash!

51:01.626 --> 51:02.925
Out.

51:02.927 --> 51:03.927
- No.

51:07.397 --> 51:11.233
- The garbage, it'll come
back and it'll haunt you.

51:12.602 --> 51:13.402
- Haunt?

51:13.404 --> 51:14.503
- Uh-huh, haunt.

51:14.505 --> 51:18.107
The trash will haunt you.

51:19.576 --> 51:21.644
- Curse?

51:21.646 --> 51:23.679
- That's right.

51:23.681 --> 51:28.684
Old, moldy, smelly garbage is a
curse.

51:34.025 --> 51:36.459
- My son wanted to be a doctor.

51:36.461 --> 51:39.628
I remortgaged the house,
i sold everything I could,

51:39.630 --> 51:41.764
worked a second job,
all to try and get him

51:41.766 --> 51:43.866
through medical school.
- And what happened?

51:43.868 --> 51:45.868
- Well, he became a doctor.

51:45.870 --> 51:49.105
Got a good practice, good house.

51:49.107 --> 51:52.041
And every once in a while if I'm
lucky

51:52.043 --> 51:53.676
he sends me a Christmas card.

51:55.112 --> 51:57.613
- Come on, Peter!

51:57.615 --> 52:01.984
Let's not play this game
anymore, just talk to me!

52:01.986 --> 52:03.886
- No.

52:03.888 --> 52:05.488
Don't curse me.

52:10.361 --> 52:13.662
- Relax, it's just the food.

52:16.733 --> 52:18.334
Who is it?

52:18.336 --> 52:19.969
- Delivery.

52:19.971 --> 52:21.837
- You can just leave it out
there, please.

52:21.839 --> 52:23.072
- Okay.

52:28.678 --> 52:29.879
- Stand down!

52:29.881 --> 52:31.714
- No!

52:41.124 --> 52:42.391
- Oh my god.

52:46.463 --> 52:47.730
- Daddy!

52:55.605 --> 52:57.373
- Oh, son.

52:57.375 --> 52:59.175
You're not eating.

52:59.177 --> 53:01.076
- I'd die first!

53:01.078 --> 53:03.746
- The great tragedy in life is
not death,

53:03.748 --> 53:06.448
it's what dies inside of
you while you're living.

53:06.450 --> 53:07.516
- I'm not a fucking robot

53:07.518 --> 53:09.351
that you can just keep
programming.

53:09.353 --> 53:12.254
- No, but you're becoming a
robot that has no program.

53:18.862 --> 53:21.530
- Peter says if he had
a gun he would kill you.

53:21.532 --> 53:23.599
- Well he doesn't have,

53:23.601 --> 53:25.901
so I'm safe and so are you.

53:27.571 --> 53:29.271
I'm keeping my eye on you buddy.

53:29.273 --> 53:30.873
Oh damn.

53:30.875 --> 53:32.374
There's nothing in there.

53:32.376 --> 53:34.376
There's no nutrition!

53:34.378 --> 53:36.111
Nothing but stupid stuff.

53:36.113 --> 53:38.581
This is not an attack.

53:38.583 --> 53:40.616
This is a rescue mission.

53:40.618 --> 53:42.251
- You phony prick!

53:42.253 --> 53:44.320
You never loved me.

53:44.322 --> 53:45.621
- I do love you.

53:45.623 --> 53:46.755
- No you don't!

53:46.757 --> 53:48.757
- I do love you!

53:51.494 --> 53:53.462
I'll be back.

53:53.464 --> 53:55.798
With more reinforcements.

53:55.800 --> 53:57.233
I'm gonna make my point with
you, son,

53:57.235 --> 53:58.601
and you're gonna get it.

53:58.603 --> 53:59.635
That's my mission here.

53:59.637 --> 54:01.136
You can yell and scream all you
want

54:01.138 --> 54:03.239
but I do not fail.

54:07.510 --> 54:08.777
Oh boy.

54:12.582 --> 54:14.183
- What're we gonna do?

54:19.189 --> 54:20.422
Stop it, Peter!

54:20.424 --> 54:22.791
I'm not perfect yet.

54:22.793 --> 54:25.294
- You tried to be
separate, you let him in.

54:25.296 --> 54:26.996
Refused to be cleansed.

54:26.998 --> 54:28.697
- He forced his way in.

54:28.699 --> 54:30.332
- Don't even try to know my
thoughts!

54:30.334 --> 54:32.268
- He knocked me against the door

54:32.270 --> 54:34.003
and it really hurt.

54:34.005 --> 54:36.839
Okay, what number am I thinking
right now?

54:36.841 --> 54:38.140
- You let him in.

54:38.142 --> 54:39.942
- You don't know because
you can't read my mind,

54:39.944 --> 54:41.644
but I guess that's my fault too.

54:41.646 --> 54:43.112
- And now you're lying about it.

54:43.114 --> 54:45.714
- See, you tried to say that
you're being one with me

54:45.716 --> 54:47.816
but, you know, it's nothing
but excuses to talk to you.

54:47.818 --> 54:48.817
Wrong.

54:48.819 --> 54:50.352
You keep sabotaging everything.

54:50.354 --> 54:51.787
- Me?

54:51.789 --> 54:54.123
Draw.

54:54.125 --> 54:55.357
Just work it out.

54:55.359 --> 54:56.659
Write it down.

54:57.560 --> 54:59.995
- I could kill you so easily.

54:59.997 --> 55:02.317
- You can't kill me, cause then
we can't finish the gospel.

55:02.832 --> 55:06.568
No, you must protect me.

55:07.437 --> 55:08.704
It's our work.

55:08.706 --> 55:10.039
- My work!

55:10.041 --> 55:11.874
- I will haunt you!

55:11.876 --> 55:14.043
I will come back and I will
screech and I will hiss

55:14.045 --> 55:16.045
at all hours, and then I will
find your father and I will

55:16.047 --> 55:18.247
haunt him too, so much that
I'll make him come back here

55:18.249 --> 55:20.082
and find you and he'll put
you in the place where they

55:20.084 --> 55:21.750
keep the fucking loonies.

55:23.953 --> 55:25.321
So draw!

55:28.124 --> 55:29.558
Put down what you...

55:32.595 --> 55:33.996
What you're feeling.

55:46.376 --> 55:50.112
I know now that it's pain
that motivates Peter.

55:50.114 --> 55:54.083
How I loathe to hurt him, but he
needs it.

55:54.085 --> 55:57.086
He gathers his strength
by rallying against it.

55:57.088 --> 55:59.788
But I must not abuse this power.

55:59.790 --> 56:01.957
It can only be used for
the good of the gospel.

56:13.503 --> 56:16.405
&k there goes my heart

56:18.408 --> 56:21.377
&k there goes my heart

56:24.647 --> 56:28.050
&k there goes my heart

56:30.754 --> 56:33.589
&k there goes my heart &k

56:41.364 --> 56:43.298
- police, open up!

56:43.300 --> 56:45.834
You won't answer the phone.

56:45.836 --> 56:46.935
- Daddy!

56:46.937 --> 56:47.636
- I've got the police here

56:47.638 --> 56:49.138
to force their way in.

56:49.140 --> 56:50.406
- Daddy, please go away.

56:50.408 --> 56:51.240
- No!

56:51.242 --> 56:52.674
I'm not going away.

56:52.676 --> 56:53.976
- Peter, this is officer Bauer.

56:53.978 --> 56:55.844
Open the door, please.

56:55.846 --> 56:56.846
- Daddy...

56:58.214 --> 56:59.481
If you love me-
- shut up!

56:59.483 --> 57:01.483
You open the door now.

57:01.485 --> 57:02.951
- I can only get through this
without you,

57:02.953 --> 57:03.952
do you understand?

57:03.954 --> 57:04.953
- You need my help!

57:04.955 --> 57:06.955
Open up the door!

57:06.957 --> 57:08.357
- No!

57:08.359 --> 57:09.691
- Well I got news for you,

57:09.693 --> 57:12.027
I'm gonna force this door open.

57:13.763 --> 57:15.431
- If you do, I'll never forgive
you.

57:15.433 --> 57:16.999
- Sir, we can't just bust
down someone's door without

57:17.001 --> 57:18.534
just cause.
- Are you worried

57:18.536 --> 57:19.635
about his safety?

57:21.104 --> 57:22.771
- I'm his father.

57:22.773 --> 57:24.273
That's why I'm pushing hard.

57:25.708 --> 57:28.477
And maybe I should be
using a gentler approach.

57:28.479 --> 57:30.112
I don't know how to do that.

57:30.114 --> 57:32.047
- That tends to be more
effective in these situations.

57:32.049 --> 57:33.816
- Here's my card.

57:33.818 --> 57:36.452
If things escalate we
can always come back,

57:36.454 --> 57:37.486
try this again.

57:37.488 --> 57:38.488
- Yes ma'am.

57:39.489 --> 57:41.056
Well thank you both very much.

57:41.058 --> 57:42.058
- Good luck.

57:50.099 --> 57:52.701
- Peter, I've sent the police
away.

57:52.703 --> 57:53.802
Are you still there?

57:53.804 --> 57:54.803
- Yes.

57:54.805 --> 57:57.906
- This is good, us
having a talk like this.

57:57.908 --> 57:59.374
Do you feel it's good?

58:00.743 --> 58:01.743
- No.

58:03.813 --> 58:06.682
- I appreciate it even more.

58:06.684 --> 58:09.818
I want to know how your lady
friend in there is doing?

58:09.820 --> 58:11.353
She's beautiful.

58:11.355 --> 58:14.223
You better be treating
her like the lady she is.

58:14.225 --> 58:15.257
- Go away, dad.

58:15.259 --> 58:17.192
- I love you, son.

58:17.194 --> 58:20.195
I'll come back tomorrow and
we can talk some more then.

58:21.164 --> 58:22.164
- Maybe.

58:23.700 --> 58:25.868
- Maybe?

58:25.870 --> 58:27.002
That's a good answer.

58:28.605 --> 58:29.905
- Maybe.

58:29.907 --> 58:31.707
- I heard you.

58:31.709 --> 58:33.375
I like it when you're talking to
me.

58:37.981 --> 58:39.381
Keep feeling that!

59:01.705 --> 59:02.905
- What? What did I do?

59:02.907 --> 59:04.239
- No more curses.

59:04.241 --> 59:05.774
- I didn't curse anything.

59:05.776 --> 59:07.643
- How did it get in?

59:07.645 --> 59:08.644
- What?

59:08.646 --> 59:10.646
- That thing that you were
chanting.

59:10.648 --> 59:11.480
- That?

59:11.482 --> 59:14.550
That's just an old tune from
a stupid dog food commercial.

59:14.552 --> 59:16.718
- Do you want some dog food,
Tess?

59:16.720 --> 59:18.554
- Ow, ow, no I don't!

59:18.556 --> 59:21.089
- This place could be paradise
but you keep letting them in!

59:21.091 --> 59:22.824
- Letting what in?

59:22.826 --> 59:23.725
Peter!

59:23.727 --> 59:25.494
Peter, gather your thoughts for
me.

59:27.064 --> 59:29.431
- They could've used
psychology to cure the sick.

59:29.433 --> 59:31.600
They'll trick us into
remembering useless garbage.

59:31.602 --> 59:34.436
Useless, pointless garbage!

59:34.438 --> 59:38.240
Filling up our head until we
can't think straight anymore.

59:38.242 --> 59:40.842
You don't have any privacy.

59:40.844 --> 59:43.845
You consistently look at me
with that confused expression

59:43.847 --> 59:46.448
on your face because
you really don't care.

59:46.450 --> 59:48.417
Because you can't think straight
enough

59:48.419 --> 59:50.519
to realize what you lost!

59:50.521 --> 59:53.789
- Peter!

59:53.791 --> 59:56.091
Stop just staring off
into space like that.

59:56.093 --> 59:57.926
If you have something in your
head

59:57.928 --> 59:59.995
you have to share it with me.

59:59.997 --> 01:00:01.763
- No!

01:00:01.765 --> 01:00:03.265
You'll pollute it.

01:00:03.267 --> 01:00:04.666
You'll curse it.

01:00:04.668 --> 01:00:05.801
- How?

01:00:05.803 --> 01:00:07.803
It was just a little jingle.

01:00:07.805 --> 01:00:09.271
- That doesn't bother you?

01:00:09.273 --> 01:00:10.706
- No!

01:00:10.708 --> 01:00:12.307
No please!

01:00:12.309 --> 01:00:13.842
Please stop! Please!

01:00:13.844 --> 01:00:15.944
We're making our own experiment.

01:00:15.946 --> 01:00:18.046
Peter, we're...

01:00:18.048 --> 01:00:19.948
We're creating.

01:00:19.950 --> 01:00:22.651
We're our own gods in our own
universe.

01:00:22.653 --> 01:00:26.355
God must have Satan: You.

01:00:26.357 --> 01:00:27.823
- No, please don't do this.

01:00:27.825 --> 01:00:30.025
I love you so much and I just
want

01:00:30.027 --> 01:00:33.395
us to be happy and serene!

01:00:47.110 --> 01:00:50.345
From now on I write in code,

01:00:50.347 --> 01:00:53.181
a simple one I taught
myself in high school.

01:00:59.089 --> 01:01:01.723
Apparently I'm not working fast
enough.

01:01:07.296 --> 01:01:09.197
I'm falling too far behind.

01:01:11.434 --> 01:01:14.236
I must find a way, i
need to get to his level.

01:01:17.807 --> 01:01:19.074
This'll be my mission.

01:01:19.842 --> 01:01:20.909
It will not fail.

01:01:27.383 --> 01:01:30.719
I must know, I must understand
why he

01:01:30.721 --> 01:01:33.255
did that to me.

01:01:33.257 --> 01:01:35.524
- Well let's get some more
light on this freak show.

01:01:38.628 --> 01:01:40.729
- The thing is, is that, uh,

01:01:40.731 --> 01:01:42.397
I didn't really talk to the guy
that much.

01:01:42.399 --> 01:01:43.932
We didn't hang out that much.

01:01:43.934 --> 01:01:45.534
- I doubt we'll ever find the
motive here.

01:01:45.536 --> 01:01:47.302
- I sent him an e-vite to go
hang out

01:01:47.304 --> 01:01:50.072
maybe go on a double
date, but he seemed busy.

01:01:51.541 --> 01:01:53.241
- How?
- - Easily.

01:01:59.515 --> 01:02:00.882
- Why?

01:02:00.884 --> 01:02:02.150
- To give me more time.

01:02:04.253 --> 01:02:07.756
- Ah, but there is no time in
here.

01:02:07.758 --> 01:02:09.591
- But there's still wasted
moments.

01:02:09.593 --> 01:02:12.160
- I don't think I understand
this one.

01:02:12.162 --> 01:02:13.462
- You will.

01:02:15.598 --> 01:02:19.801
- Mm-mm, how do you transcend
needing sex?

01:02:19.803 --> 01:02:20.836
- Easily.

01:02:24.574 --> 01:02:28.176
- I don't think you know
how this makes me feel.

01:02:28.178 --> 01:02:29.978
- Think about it.

01:02:29.980 --> 01:02:32.781
The one desire that they use

01:02:32.783 --> 01:02:35.951
as a catalyst to manipulate you.

01:02:35.953 --> 01:02:37.319
- But what about us?

01:02:37.321 --> 01:02:38.520
Our oneness?

01:02:39.756 --> 01:02:42.257
- Think about how close we will
be now.

01:02:42.259 --> 01:02:45.327
We'll be forced to create
more complex ways to connect.

01:02:45.329 --> 01:02:47.963
Richer, deeper.

01:02:55.271 --> 01:02:57.005
- Get up.

01:02:57.007 --> 01:02:58.774
You stink.

01:02:58.776 --> 01:02:59.975
Go take a shower.

01:03:01.144 --> 01:03:02.644
Go!

01:03:02.646 --> 01:03:04.346
Steam will do you good.

01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:12.320
Asshole.

01:03:39.649 --> 01:03:41.249
You son of a bitch!

01:03:41.251 --> 01:03:43.385
Transcending sex, my ass!

01:03:46.590 --> 01:03:48.657
You can kidnap me, you can abuse
me,

01:03:48.659 --> 01:03:50.592
but you will not fucking ignore
me!

01:03:52.362 --> 01:03:55.263
Come on, bring it back.

01:03:55.265 --> 01:03:56.832
Bring it back, bring it back!

01:03:56.834 --> 01:03:58.733
Bring it back, it's mine!

01:04:04.507 --> 01:04:06.341
Yeah.

01:04:06.343 --> 01:04:08.009
It's mine.

01:04:08.011 --> 01:04:10.679
Oh it's fucking mine
and don't you forget it!

01:04:10.681 --> 01:04:12.547
It is mine!

01:04:15.886 --> 01:04:17.385
No!

01:04:17.387 --> 01:04:19.054
No!

01:04:20.389 --> 01:04:21.790
You could've waited.

01:04:22.825 --> 01:04:25.694
- I could have.

01:04:37.473 --> 01:04:39.040
Fuck you!

01:04:42.144 --> 01:04:44.312
Fuck you!

01:04:44.314 --> 01:04:45.814
Fuck you!

01:04:45.816 --> 01:04:47.315
- Yeah?

01:04:58.527 --> 01:04:59.728
Take out the trash.

01:05:13.342 --> 01:05:14.342
- Hungry?

01:05:15.544 --> 01:05:16.578
- Die.

01:05:24.754 --> 01:05:26.955
- Write, contessa.

01:05:48.545 --> 01:05:49.778
- Don't do that.

01:05:49.780 --> 01:05:52.113
- Look how easy i let you go.

01:05:52.115 --> 01:05:53.682
- Tess is onto a better place.

01:05:53.684 --> 01:05:55.216
- Any shape that you wanted.

01:05:55.218 --> 01:05:56.685
- A better plateau

01:05:56.687 --> 01:05:59.020
of love, kindness, trust, and
truth.

01:06:00.389 --> 01:06:02.490
Funerals are very important.

01:06:02.492 --> 01:06:04.125
- They're still here.

01:06:04.127 --> 01:06:05.393
- One who
has died, has passed on.

01:06:05.395 --> 01:06:09.030
- Little tiny
hooks inside my head.

01:06:17.641 --> 01:06:19.908
- Unknown caller.

01:06:19.910 --> 01:06:21.209
- What?

01:06:21.211 --> 01:06:22.771
- Greetings and
good morning to you sir.

01:06:23.412 --> 01:06:25.013
I'm from jc marketing.

01:06:25.015 --> 01:06:26.314
We have a survey we'd like you
to do

01:06:26.316 --> 01:06:28.016
that'll take no time at all.

01:06:28.018 --> 01:06:29.651
- That's not possible.

01:06:29.653 --> 01:06:31.219
- Oh, well we were just
wondering

01:06:31.221 --> 01:06:33.521
how often do you vacation up
north?

01:06:33.523 --> 01:06:35.357
- My god, how did you find me?

01:06:35.359 --> 01:06:37.993
What do I have to do to get
a moment's peace around here?

01:06:37.995 --> 01:06:40.095
I just wanted one moment!

01:06:44.133 --> 01:06:45.867
- How are we gonna order food?

01:06:46.769 --> 01:06:48.570
- We have plenty of food.

01:06:51.607 --> 01:06:53.708
- This is actually a nice
apartment.

01:06:53.710 --> 01:06:55.343
- God knows what they od'd on.

01:06:55.345 --> 01:06:58.747
- Uh, I don't think it was
drugs.

01:06:58.749 --> 01:07:01.683
I think they starved themselves
and died of malnutrition.

01:07:13.529 --> 01:07:15.430
- You do know that when we run
out of food

01:07:15.432 --> 01:07:16.731
we're gonna have to go to a
neighbor's

01:07:16.733 --> 01:07:19.634
and use their phone to
order more groceries.

01:07:21.504 --> 01:07:22.504
- Yes.

01:07:23.806 --> 01:07:24.806
We will.

01:08:13.756 --> 01:08:16.024
- You happy, son?

01:08:16.026 --> 01:08:17.492
- Not ignorant.

01:08:20.196 --> 01:08:21.629
I can't be.

01:08:21.631 --> 01:08:24.032
- The best way to stay happy

01:08:24.033 --> 01:08:26.468
is let go of the pain.

01:08:26.470 --> 01:08:27.935
You're in pain now,

01:08:27.938 --> 01:08:29.537
let it go.

01:08:29.538 --> 01:08:31.673
- Why couldn't we have
talked like this more?

01:08:41.584 --> 01:08:44.819
- Peter's genius
is becoming clearer to me.

01:08:44.821 --> 01:08:47.188
Hunger turns in to knowledge.

01:08:47.189 --> 01:08:51.024
And now I stand next to the
truth.

01:08:51.027 --> 01:08:53.361
And the world will soon...

01:09:40.442 --> 01:09:42.544
And the world will soon be able

01:09:42.546 --> 01:09:44.845
to relish in in his brilliance.

01:09:46.814 --> 01:09:50.518
- Okay, so the cab is
gonna be here in 20, and...

01:09:50.520 --> 01:09:51.853
Where are your bags?

01:09:51.854 --> 01:09:53.854
- You didn't get my message?

01:09:53.857 --> 01:09:55.924
- Oh shit.

01:09:55.926 --> 01:09:57.792
- They're dying in there.

01:09:57.794 --> 01:09:59.227
They're wasting away to nothing.

01:09:59.229 --> 01:10:01.229
- These tickets are
nonrefundable.

01:10:01.231 --> 01:10:03.031
- But I did what you said;

01:10:03.033 --> 01:10:05.266
I stopped trying to control him.

01:10:05.268 --> 01:10:08.036
You know, Peter needs to
talk or all of his thoughts

01:10:08.038 --> 01:10:11.039
build up inside him and
he hasn't been the same

01:10:11.041 --> 01:10:13.107
since his mother died.

01:10:13.109 --> 01:10:14.909
- So? Have you?

01:10:16.912 --> 01:10:19.581
He just wants to sit and
wallow in his own self pity

01:10:19.583 --> 01:10:21.549
for a while, and you
want to help him do it?

01:10:21.551 --> 01:10:24.552
This vacation is the best thing
that could happen for you.

01:10:24.554 --> 01:10:26.154
And for him.

01:10:26.156 --> 01:10:28.323
- I can't, I just...

01:10:28.325 --> 01:10:31.593
- How are you supposed
to teach him about living

01:10:31.595 --> 01:10:34.495
if you don't?

01:10:34.497 --> 01:10:36.497
Now I want you to go back your
bags

01:10:36.499 --> 01:10:37.966
and I want...

01:10:42.171 --> 01:10:44.639
Okay Arnie.

01:10:44.641 --> 01:10:46.507
You go give Peter what he needs.

01:10:52.548 --> 01:10:53.815
You'll know where to find me.

01:11:11.734 --> 01:11:13.501
- I'm not afraid.

01:11:13.503 --> 01:11:15.436
There's no sacrifice here.

01:11:16.405 --> 01:11:19.507
I'm too anxious, too desperate

01:11:19.509 --> 01:11:23.511
for us to reach the
next realm of our worry.

01:11:23.513 --> 01:11:25.613
My words will survive.

01:11:25.615 --> 01:11:28.149
I've made sure Peter can't harm
them.

01:11:33.088 --> 01:11:34.622
- Got a bit of a problem here.

01:11:34.624 --> 01:11:35.890
- What?

01:11:35.892 --> 01:11:38.159
- He don't seem to want to let
go.

01:11:38.161 --> 01:11:39.160
Maybe if I just-

01:11:39.162 --> 01:11:40.695
- oh, no, take "m together."

01:11:40.697 --> 01:11:41.829
Figure it out.

01:11:41.831 --> 01:11:43.464
I want them out of here
before the press shows up

01:11:43.466 --> 01:11:45.667
and tries to turn this into a
thing.

01:11:45.669 --> 01:11:47.201
Samson, come on!

01:11:47.203 --> 01:11:48.236
- Yeah, sorry boss.

01:12:42.191 --> 01:12:44.792
- I am king.

01:12:48.897 --> 01:12:51.466
I am king.

01:13:02.311 --> 01:13:05.780
I am king.

01:13:10.620 --> 01:13:12.653
Call from: God.

01:13:15.458 --> 01:13:17.425
Call from: God.

01:13:21.598 --> 01:13:24.332
- Time to cleanse.

01:13:30.038 --> 01:13:32.473
- I know you
feel like your life is over.

01:13:33.609 --> 01:13:35.276
- Cleanse.

01:13:35.278 --> 01:13:37.645
- But that's not true.

01:13:37.647 --> 01:13:39.113
It's just beginning.

01:13:55.097 --> 01:13:57.865
You need to learn to laugh
in the face of death.

01:14:15.651 --> 01:14:17.318
- Here, fixed!

01:14:21.957 --> 01:14:23.157
- Turn around.

01:14:28.464 --> 01:14:30.398
- Oh, you're a tennis player?

01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.633
- Well I used to be. Drunk
driver.

01:14:32.635 --> 01:14:35.303
- Well I bet you're good.

01:14:35.305 --> 01:14:37.171
- I just picked the
wrong day to go outside.

01:14:46.582 --> 01:14:48.382
- Shh.

01:14:49.585 --> 01:14:51.085
It's okay, dad.

01:14:52.621 --> 01:14:55.223
I'm almost cleansed.

01:14:58.895 --> 01:14:59.727
I hate you!

01:14:59.729 --> 01:15:00.728
- Look at you, come here!

01:15:00.730 --> 01:15:02.196
You don't hate me!

01:15:02.198 --> 01:15:06.100
You can't hate me because
my love for you is

01:15:06.102 --> 01:15:08.436
so strong you can't defeat it!

01:15:08.438 --> 01:15:11.205
You don't hate me, you
don't know what hate is.

01:15:11.207 --> 01:15:14.008
Don't do this to yourself.

01:15:14.010 --> 01:15:15.543
You can't do it to me anymore,

01:15:15.545 --> 01:15:16.511
cause I'm not gonna let you.

01:15:16.513 --> 01:15:17.513
- Cleanse.

01:15:19.582 --> 01:15:21.249
- Die! Die!

01:15:21.251 --> 01:15:22.683
- You have to do something.

01:15:22.685 --> 01:15:24.785
Knife through the heart,
together.

01:16:00.522 --> 01:16:01.622
- Six minutes.

01:16:05.527 --> 01:16:06.961
- Six minutes.

01:16:08.897 --> 01:16:10.965
- That's how long it
took to get the job done.

01:16:11.934 --> 01:16:13.801
Six minutes.

01:16:17.406 --> 01:16:19.273
- We can do better than that.

01:16:21.043 --> 01:16:22.109
- Next time.

01:16:26.715 --> 01:16:28.115
- We can do it better.

01:16:36.525 --> 01:16:38.793
I read my pizza.

01:16:38.795 --> 01:16:41.529
- Oh, sorry about that.

01:16:44.967 --> 01:16:46.534
- You missed a spot.

01:16:57.579 --> 01:16:58.846
- Look at me!

01:16:58.848 --> 01:17:00.114
Look at me!

01:17:02.018 --> 01:17:03.684
- You look adorable.

01:17:05.087 --> 01:17:07.021
- You have a way of
making a girl

01:17:07.023 --> 01:17:09.056
feel very special.

01:17:09.058 --> 01:17:10.157
- Just you.

01:17:12.961 --> 01:17:14.795
- Um...

01:17:14.797 --> 01:17:15.896
Uh...

01:17:15.898 --> 01:17:16.998
- Oh, I'm sorry.

01:17:19.902 --> 01:17:21.636
- It's just really fast.

01:17:26.308 --> 01:17:27.308
- It felt so different.

01:17:27.310 --> 01:17:28.476
It just felt, uh-

01:17:28.478 --> 01:17:29.910
- wonderful, it felt wonderful.

01:17:29.912 --> 01:17:32.713
I don't mean to suggest that...

01:17:32.715 --> 01:17:34.649
We can't find something special.

01:17:36.284 --> 01:17:38.919
I'm just feeling really
overwhelmed.

01:17:38.921 --> 01:17:40.855
- Then why not stay?

01:17:40.857 --> 01:17:41.822
- What?

01:17:41.824 --> 01:17:44.492
- I mean, why not have a two-night
stand at the very least?

01:18:14.322 --> 01:18:16.123
- A moment's peace.

01:18:42.985 --> 01:18:46.954
&k there goes my heart

01:18:46.956 --> 01:18:51.959
&k there goes my heart

01:18:52.394 --> 01:18:57.098
&k there goes my heart

01:18:57.100 --> 01:19:00.401
&k there goes my heart

01:19:03.939 --> 01:19:07.575
&k there goes my heart &k

01:19:15.417 --> 01:19:17.351
