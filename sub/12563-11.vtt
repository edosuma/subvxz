18:56.413 --> 18:58.146
[Mouthing] Oh, my God.

19:00.182 --> 19:01.416
Mmm. Oh, my God.

19:01.418 --> 19:02.884
This is terrific.

19:02.886 --> 19:04.953
I can't believe you made
all this from scratch.

19:04.955 --> 19:06.555
It's unbelievable. Really.

19:06.557 --> 19:08.056
My grandma Dollie taught me how to cook

19:08.058 --> 19:10.559
when I was knee-high to a grasshopper.

19:10.561 --> 19:12.160
You have a grandma Dollie?

19:12.162 --> 19:13.795
With seven brothers.

19:13.797 --> 19:16.131
Alton, Elton, Lyman, Gleamon,
Herman, Thurman, and Clyde.

19:16.133 --> 19:17.499
What...
[Laughter]

19:17.501 --> 19:19.968
- You're making that up.
- No, honest. Really.

19:19.970 --> 19:21.670
Gleamon Lawson. What do you think of that?

19:21.672 --> 19:23.004
- Um, no.
- Okay.

19:23.006 --> 19:25.173
[Laughter]
With all due respect to kale,

19:25.175 --> 19:27.842
it's just nice to eat
real food for a change.

19:27.844 --> 19:29.044
Mm-hmm.

19:29.046 --> 19:30.679
This is actually my grandma's recipe.

19:30.681 --> 19:32.047
What's in it?

19:32.049 --> 19:34.583
I've never tasted anything
with flavors like this.

19:34.585 --> 19:36.751
It's, uh, possum pie.

19:36.753 --> 19:39.220
Oh.

19:39.222 --> 19:41.590
But apparently, you can't
get decent possum at Citarella,

19:41.592 --> 19:43.258
so I just used chicken.

19:43.260 --> 19:44.726
- Oh, chicken.
- Ah.

19:44.728 --> 19:46.895
Hank, did you not check
in the critter aisle?

19:46.897 --> 19:48.530
- I did not.
- Go ahead, no.

19:48.532 --> 19:50.565
Poke fun, you know.

19:50.567 --> 19:52.400
I know a lot of people
look at us folks from Arkansas

19:52.402 --> 19:54.469
like... like we're related
to Larry the cable guy,

19:54.471 --> 19:57.639
but... I love where I'm from.

19:57.641 --> 19:59.341
It's important in this business

19:59.343 --> 20:00.609
to have a strong identity,

20:00.611 --> 20:02.544
so you don't get carried away and...

20:02.546 --> 20:05.680
Because of my family,
I know exactly who I am.

20:05.682 --> 20:07.182
Hmm.

20:07.184 --> 20:09.784
You're very lucky.

20:09.786 --> 20:12.587
Your possum chicken is better
than anything I cook.

20:12.589 --> 20:15.023
- Anything.
- He is not kidding at all.

20:15.025 --> 20:17.125
Hank, when we were little,
he used to cook fish sticks.

20:17.127 --> 20:18.259
That was his thing, fish sticks.

20:18.261 --> 20:19.628
- Okay.
- All the time.

20:19.630 --> 20:21.830
One summer, every single night
he baked fish sticks.

20:21.832 --> 20:23.465
- Not every night.
- I genuinely believed

20:23.467 --> 20:25.200
Mrs. Paul was a member of my family.

20:25.202 --> 20:26.668
[Laughter] Seriously.

20:26.670 --> 20:28.103
Ev, you don't remember,
but mom was the terrible cook.

20:28.105 --> 20:29.537
Where do you think I learned?

20:29.539 --> 20:30.672
She had three appliances in the kitchen...

20:30.674 --> 20:32.574
a toaster, a microwave,
and a de-flavorizer.

20:32.576 --> 20:33.775
[Laughter]

20:33.777 --> 20:35.243
She was a really bad cook, wasn't she?

20:35.245 --> 20:36.578
Really bad. [Two cell phones chime]

20:36.580 --> 20:37.946
Excuse me.

20:40.516 --> 20:42.050
Uh, your blood results are in.

20:43.953 --> 20:45.453
So the tests came back,

20:45.455 --> 20:47.589
and the results look good,
but there were issues.

20:47.591 --> 20:50.191
Some of the blood cells ruptured
during the potassium test,

20:50.193 --> 20:51.926
which is why we're taking another sample.

20:51.928 --> 20:53.595
But the other tests showed low renin

20:53.597 --> 20:55.230
and low aldosterone,

20:55.232 --> 20:58.667
so it could be pheochromocytoma

20:58.669 --> 20:59.968
or maybe Cushing's.

20:59.970 --> 21:02.437
- Mm-hmm.
- What does all that mean?

21:02.439 --> 21:05.140
There may be problems in
your pituitary adrenal system.

21:05.142 --> 21:07.909
Your body might be producing
too much cortisol.

21:07.911 --> 21:10.512
I think we should do
a 12-hour cortisol test.

21:10.514 --> 21:12.147
Cushing's typically
presents with weight gain,

21:12.149 --> 21:13.782
which Ava doesn't have.

21:13.784 --> 21:15.116
Why don't we get an MRI in the morning,

21:15.118 --> 21:16.985
and this potassium test
will give us a better picture?

21:16.987 --> 21:18.520
You know, if we start tonight,

21:18.522 --> 21:20.555
then we won't have to wait
another 12 hours.

21:20.557 --> 21:22.123
I could do the overnight draws.

21:22.125 --> 21:24.192
- You sure?
- Sure.

21:24.194 --> 21:26.861
I don't sleep
more than three hours at a time.

21:26.863 --> 21:28.463
I read a lot.

21:28.465 --> 21:30.565
Uh, okay. The test is simple.

21:30.567 --> 21:32.734
You just have to spit into a cup
every four hours

21:32.736 --> 21:33.768
for the next 12 hours.

21:33.770 --> 21:35.303
Okay. Where's the cup?

21:35.305 --> 21:36.538
Uh, we can't start

21:36.540 --> 21:38.173
until at least an hour after you've eaten.

21:38.175 --> 21:40.041
I'll come by your hotel at 11:00

21:40.043 --> 21:41.409
and then return at 3:00 A.M.

21:41.411 --> 21:42.577
and then again at 7:00 A.M.

21:42.579 --> 21:44.412
Well, okay.

21:44.414 --> 21:45.980
I'll see you then.

21:45.982 --> 21:50.085
Good lord willing
and the creek don't rise.

21:51.854 --> 21:54.122
I... I just want to thank you all again

21:54.124 --> 21:56.725
for making me feel so at home
and letting me cook.

21:56.727 --> 21:59.561
- Thanks for cooking.
- Oh, my God, our pleasure.

21:59.563 --> 22:00.729
Thank you so much.

22:00.731 --> 22:03.264
- Bye.
All: - Bye.

22:07.970 --> 22:09.738
That was so fun!

22:09.740 --> 22:12.507
I can't believe Ava.
She's so down to earth.

22:12.509 --> 22:15.176
I know, she really is.
[Chuckles]

22:15.178 --> 22:16.478
I couldn't help but notice
that you didn't share

22:16.480 --> 22:19.280
any bizarre family stories of your own.

22:19.282 --> 22:21.149
That bad?

22:21.151 --> 22:23.084
That good.

22:23.086 --> 22:24.519
I have a great family.

22:24.521 --> 22:26.821
We're close. I talk to them all the time.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.389
Makes for very boring stories.

22:28.391 --> 22:30.492
Well, that's the good kind of boring.

22:30.494 --> 22:31.993
I mean, look, no family's perfect,

22:31.995 --> 22:34.696
but my parents set the bar pretty high.

22:34.698 --> 22:35.997
They were both professors,

22:35.999 --> 22:38.066
but they traded off being home
with the kids.

22:38.068 --> 22:40.335
Sharing the responsibility
was important to them.

22:40.337 --> 22:42.036
Now it's important to me.

22:42.038 --> 22:43.538
That's why no doctors.

22:43.540 --> 22:46.908
Let's face it. They always put work first.

22:46.910 --> 22:47.942
"They"?

22:47.944 --> 22:50.345
Doctors who aren't me.

22:50.347 --> 22:51.346
And when it comes to counting on them

22:51.348 --> 22:53.047
for social obligations...

22:53.049 --> 22:55.250
I was kind of hoping
we could forget about that.

22:55.252 --> 22:57.552
[Chuckling] You made up for it tonight.

22:57.554 --> 23:00.155
I mean, where else in the Hamptons

23:00.157 --> 23:03.525
am I gonna get good possum chicken pie?

23:03.527 --> 23:05.059
[Chuckles]

23:05.061 --> 23:07.228
Well, I'm glad we can still be friends.

23:07.230 --> 23:09.164
Me too.

23:15.571 --> 23:17.205
[Engine starts]

23:17.207 --> 23:18.673
Thanks again for having me.

23:18.675 --> 23:20.441
I had a really great time.

23:20.443 --> 23:21.609
Me too.

23:23.412 --> 23:24.813
[Blasting <i>Dancing With The Devil</i> ]

23:24.815 --> 23:27.682
Whoa! Uh, you really are a big fan.

23:27.684 --> 23:30.218
Sorry. Huge.

23:30.220 --> 23:32.187
And I didn't geek out once during dinner.

23:32.189 --> 23:34.055
I'm very proud of myself.

23:34.057 --> 23:36.491
You should be.

23:36.493 --> 23:38.493
- Bye.
- Bye.

24:34.250 --> 24:35.550
[Sighs]

24:35.552 --> 24:37.151
Close your eyes.

24:48.797 --> 24:50.865
Now turn around.

24:58.173 --> 24:59.440
Let your hair down.

25:21.030 --> 25:23.064
Can you feel how close I am?

25:27.202 --> 25:28.636
Tell me.

25:33.642 --> 25:38.546
I can feel your breath on my neck.

25:38.548 --> 25:40.481
How does it feel?

25:43.452 --> 25:45.286
Warm.

25:50.626 --> 25:52.126
Cool.

26:03.639 --> 26:08.276
Uh-uh. You're cheating.

26:08.278 --> 26:10.845
Close your eyes.

26:10.847 --> 26:12.747
Or do I have to blindfold you?

26:15.150 --> 26:17.185
You can try.

Come on in.

Wow. Either that's a, uh,

or you're going somewhere.

an image to live up to

27:02.410 --> 27:04.410
and that I live up to it
at least twice a week.

- Uh-huh.
- Hey, could you do me a favor

27:06.447 --> 27:07.847
and grab my earrings?

They're on the sink in the bathroom.

27:28.068 --> 27:30.136
Okay... let's do this.

27:30.138 --> 27:32.138
I have been dying for a beer,

27:32.140 --> 27:33.839
but I knew I had to spit first.

27:33.841 --> 27:36.342
Yeah, um, now, I... I will need

27:36.344 --> 27:37.443
a rather large sample.

27:56.430 --> 27:57.897
Ahem.

27:57.899 --> 27:59.899
Uh, now you will need
to provide another sample

27:59.901 --> 28:02.034
- in exactly four hours.
- Yeah, no problem.

28:02.036 --> 28:04.503
So, uh, where will you be at 3:02?

28:04.505 --> 28:07.273
I have no idea.

28:07.275 --> 28:10.609
I guess you'll have to come with me.

Are you all right?

You seem a little out of breath.

28:50.251 --> 28:53.018
Uh, yeah, yeah. I just need some water.

28:54.688 --> 28:58.224
Oh, uh, I don't have any water...

29:03.530 --> 29:05.531
What happened to my medical supplies?

29:05.533 --> 29:07.933
Oh, don't worry. I brought the spit cups.

29:07.935 --> 29:09.435
Yeah, thank goodness you had this bag.

29:09.437 --> 29:11.303
Do you know what my stylist would say

29:11.305 --> 29:12.738
if he saw a tabloid photo of me
carrying a purse

29:12.740 --> 29:15.808
with this dress? [Chuckles]

29:15.810 --> 29:17.610
I'm so glad you're here, you know?

29:17.612 --> 29:19.779
I feel really comfortable around you.

- You do?
- I do. You're direct.

29:23.251 --> 29:25.518
- Uh...
- Let's dance.

29:25.520 --> 29:27.953
Um... to be direct...

29:27.955 --> 29:29.421
I... I actually don't know how to dance.

29:29.423 --> 29:31.190

about the contents

29:31.192 --> 29:32.625
of that medical bag.

30:47.034 --> 30:48.968
Uh, can you come and take over, please?

30:48.970 --> 30:50.803
It's just 'cause I don't have
my medical equipment.

30:50.805 --> 30:52.071
It has nothing to do with the fact

30:52.073 --> 30:53.839
that there are a lot
of sweaty people here.

30:53.841 --> 30:55.741
And they're touching me,
and it's very loud and...

30:55.743 --> 30:56.876

Uh, at The Underground. It's a nightclub.

I know this is hard for you,

31:17.164 --> 31:18.530
but I also know you can do it.

31:18.532 --> 31:19.865
I'm coming to relieve you.

31:19.867 --> 31:21.333
Just don't leave before I get there.

31:21.335 --> 31:23.502
Okay, Hank, I won't.

31:28.241 --> 31:29.708
I hope.

31:34.447 --> 31:36.048
Babe?
[Sniffles]

31:41.388 --> 31:44.456
What are you doing out here?

31:48.228 --> 31:51.897
What's wrong?

31:51.899 --> 31:55.467
I just can't stop thinking
about my family.

31:59.706 --> 32:02.441
I'm grateful...

32:02.443 --> 32:05.177
to my parents for everything
they've given me,

32:05.179 --> 32:08.414
but I am so angry that they didn't

32:08.416 --> 32:10.549
tell me I was adopted, and I...

32:10.551 --> 32:13.218
feel guilty about feeling angry.

32:15.355 --> 32:17.122
You shouldn't feel guilty.

32:17.124 --> 32:21.460
How can I trust them anymore?

32:21.462 --> 32:24.697
They've taken away all sense of home.

32:27.968 --> 32:29.034
[Sniffles]

32:31.071 --> 32:32.504
I'll give you that.

32:34.107 --> 32:36.809
Start from scratch.

32:36.811 --> 32:40.446
We... you and me...

32:40.448 --> 32:41.880
we'll start a home together.

32:52.392 --> 32:54.126
Come on, Dr. J.

32:54.128 --> 32:58.364
Just one dance.

32:58.366 --> 33:01.333
Hey, just relax!

33:01.335 --> 33:02.568
Like, move your hips.

33:02.570 --> 33:05.471
Whoo! Yeah.

33:05.473 --> 33:08.574
Hey, just do what I do.

33:08.576 --> 33:10.809
Come on. Oh, yeah.

33:10.811 --> 33:13.278
That's it. No, that's it. Yeah.

33:13.280 --> 33:15.180
That's great.

33:15.182 --> 33:17.316
Hey, you looked like Clark Kent
in that phone booth,

33:17.318 --> 33:19.418
minus the glasses.

33:19.420 --> 33:22.021
One thing I never got about Superman...

33:22.023 --> 33:24.123
why the cape?

33:24.125 --> 33:25.190
It would only increase
the drag coefficient

33:25.192 --> 33:27.292
when he's flying.

33:27.294 --> 33:31.463
[Laughs]

33:31.465 --> 33:33.399
Whoo! Hey, try this one.

33:33.401 --> 33:34.700
Ready?

33:34.702 --> 33:36.235
Oh.

33:36.237 --> 33:38.037
And then... and then you.

33:38.039 --> 33:39.805
[Laughs]

33:39.807 --> 33:41.106
Whoa. Sorry.

33:41.108 --> 33:44.777
[Wheezing]

33:44.779 --> 33:46.578
Ava, Ava?

33:57.390 --> 33:59.191
You, call 911.

33:59.193 --> 34:01.894
No, back! Get back!

34:01.896 --> 34:04.196
Give us some room. Back!

34:10.235 --> 34:11.737
Excuse me. Jeremiah!

34:11.739 --> 34:13.072
Excuse me.

34:13.074 --> 34:14.606
Jeremiah.

34:14.608 --> 34:16.007
She's not breathing, but she has a pulse.

34:16.010 --> 34:17.376
Okay, I've got an ambu-bag.

34:32.201 --> 34:33.467
Ava's potassium results came back,

34:33.469 --> 34:34.869
and her levels are very low.

34:34.871 --> 34:36.737
They've started her on a potassium I.V.,

34:36.739 --> 34:38.873
but she's stabilized and sleeping.

34:38.875 --> 34:40.875
- You did good.
- Huh.

34:40.877 --> 34:42.643
But we still haven't figured out
what her problem is.

34:42.645 --> 34:44.145
No.

34:44.147 --> 34:46.447
Cushing's was a reasonable
diagnostic path to follow,

34:46.449 --> 34:48.815
but there were no diurnal
variations in cortisol levels.

34:48.818 --> 34:50.518
- Right.
- We just need to...

34:50.520 --> 34:53.219
square her low potassium
with her other symptoms

34:53.222 --> 34:54.989
while factoring in her smoking.

34:54.991 --> 34:56.322
Wait, wait, Ava said she didn't smoke.

34:56.324 --> 34:57.858
What makes you think otherwise?

34:57.860 --> 34:58.793
When I gave her mouth-to-mouth,

34:58.795 --> 35:00.361
I... I tasted tobacco.

35:00.363 --> 35:02.096
Are you sure?
Why would she lie about that?

35:02.098 --> 35:03.931
Maybe she was embarrassed.

35:03.933 --> 35:05.900
Everyone knows how foolish it is to smoke.

35:05.902 --> 35:07.401
True...

35:07.403 --> 35:09.136
I wonder if she's a heavy smoker.

35:09.138 --> 35:11.639
The answer could be in my medical bag.

35:18.080 --> 35:20.614
Th... this probably isn't
diagnostically relevant.

35:20.616 --> 35:22.149
Let's hope not.

35:26.655 --> 35:28.189
No cigarettes.

35:28.191 --> 35:30.691
Well, she wasn't lying about not smoking.

35:30.693 --> 35:31.826
She chews.

35:31.828 --> 35:33.360
- Chewing tobacco.
- Mm-hmm.

35:33.362 --> 35:35.162
That would explain
her expectorating proficiency

35:35.164 --> 35:36.664
as well as the empty soda can.

35:36.666 --> 35:38.265
She took hers with her after dinner.

35:38.267 --> 35:39.300
What kind of reaction to tobacco

35:39.302 --> 35:40.901
would cause her symptoms?

35:40.903 --> 35:44.004
This brand is heavily flavored
with licorice.

35:44.006 --> 35:45.306
Glycyrrhizic acid.

35:45.308 --> 35:47.374
Licorice poisoning. It lines up.

35:51.446 --> 35:53.447
[Whispering indistinctly]

35:57.385 --> 35:59.153
[Speaking spanish]

35:59.155 --> 36:01.155
Look at you.

36:01.157 --> 36:03.090
[Cell phone rings]

36:03.092 --> 36:04.191
It's Boris.

36:04.193 --> 36:05.326
Oh, why don't you take the call?

36:05.328 --> 36:06.494
I'll put his diaper on.

36:06.496 --> 36:07.528
Papa. Thank you.

36:07.530 --> 36:09.096
Okay. We got it.

36:09.098 --> 36:11.699
I haven't seen one of these in a while.

36:11.701 --> 36:13.300
What kind of pediatrician are you?

36:13.302 --> 36:15.536
The kind that hasn't seen
one of these in a while.

36:15.538 --> 36:16.737
Okay.

36:16.739 --> 36:17.938
But I can do it with your help.

36:17.940 --> 36:19.373
Here. Hands.

36:19.375 --> 36:21.509
Right. Okay.

36:21.511 --> 36:23.544
[Baby babbling]
Let's do this.

36:23.546 --> 36:25.446
Let's do it.

36:25.448 --> 36:26.680
- Legs.
- Legs.

36:26.682 --> 36:28.782
- Yes.
- Okay, lifting.

36:28.784 --> 36:31.819
- Good job, Carlos.
- Good work, bud.

36:31.821 --> 36:33.354
This goes here.
[Carlos blows raspberry]

36:33.356 --> 36:35.823
Uh, I don't see any safety pins.

36:35.825 --> 36:37.691
They don't use safety pins anymore.

36:37.693 --> 36:39.193
Oh, so now you're the expert.

36:39.195 --> 36:40.928
Of the two of us, yeah.

36:40.930 --> 36:42.730
Yeah?
[Giggling]

36:42.732 --> 36:44.165
I'm not so sure about that.

36:44.167 --> 36:45.533
Step aside, my friend.

36:45.535 --> 36:47.401
- Let a real man at it.
- All right.

36:47.403 --> 36:48.702
<i>Vamonos. It's gonna be okay.</i>

36:48.704 --> 36:50.337
Uh...
[Carlos crying]

36:50.339 --> 36:52.006
- I know, sweetheart.
- It's okay, bud.

36:52.008 --> 36:53.541
Started crying the second I stepped in.

36:53.543 --> 36:54.808
[Carlos crying]

36:54.810 --> 36:56.277
It's okay.

36:58.847 --> 37:00.414
Ohh.

37:00.416 --> 37:01.849
[Carlos slurping]

37:01.851 --> 37:05.019
His suck is unusually weak.

37:05.021 --> 37:06.153
[Gasps]

37:06.155 --> 37:07.555
I can't believe this.

37:07.557 --> 37:08.822
What?

37:08.824 --> 37:10.624
Ankyloglossia.

37:10.626 --> 37:14.828
[Carlos babbling and sputtering]

37:14.830 --> 37:16.997
Yeah. You're right.

37:16.999 --> 37:18.899
His lingual frenulum is unusually short.

37:18.901 --> 37:20.935
Oh, what a relief.

37:20.937 --> 37:22.436
And a frenectomy is simple.

37:22.438 --> 37:23.804
Once the membrane is cut,

37:23.806 --> 37:25.105
Carlos will have normal range of motion

37:25.107 --> 37:27.575
- with his tongue.
- Nice work.

37:27.577 --> 37:29.743
How many pediatricians
would have caught that?

37:29.745 --> 37:31.212
Not many concierge doctors

37:31.214 --> 37:33.814
would have helped me put a diaper on.

37:33.816 --> 37:35.583
All right, so the bad news is

37:35.585 --> 37:37.585
neither of us is very good
with cloth diapers.

37:37.587 --> 37:39.653
Heh, no kidding.

37:39.655 --> 37:40.955
[Laughter]
[Speaking gibberish]

37:40.957 --> 37:44.692
But the good news is we have a diagnosis.

37:44.694 --> 37:47.861
You do? What?

37:47.863 --> 37:49.663
Ankyloglossia.

37:49.665 --> 37:51.165
He's tongue-tied?

37:51.167 --> 37:52.266
That's right.

37:52.268 --> 37:54.635
And, Marisa, it's a simple fix.

37:54.637 --> 37:57.571
Ohh. Aww.

37:57.573 --> 37:59.373
You guys make a good team.

37:59.375 --> 38:01.709
[Chuckles] Mwah!

38:07.549 --> 38:08.983
This one's my favorite.

38:08.985 --> 38:11.385
Oh, they... they got my name wrong.

38:11.387 --> 38:13.387
Actually, it's not even close.

38:13.389 --> 38:15.389
[Laughter]

38:15.391 --> 38:17.224
At least you weren't
photographed carrying a purse

38:17.226 --> 38:18.359
with that dress.

38:18.361 --> 38:20.527
[Chuckles]

38:20.529 --> 38:22.630
Hey, for once, the headline is true.

38:22.632 --> 38:24.164
I did O.D...

38:24.166 --> 38:25.866
on licorice.

38:25.868 --> 38:27.568
Well, as soon as we get
your potassium levels up,

38:27.570 --> 38:29.803
you'll be dancing
with the devil in no time.

38:29.805 --> 38:32.439
[Laughs]

38:32.441 --> 38:34.508
You... saved my life,

38:34.510 --> 38:36.844
and I don't think I properly thanked you.

38:36.846 --> 38:39.413
How do I thank you?

38:39.415 --> 38:41.749
You can give up tobacco.

38:41.751 --> 38:43.083
Ah, it's easier said than done.

38:43.085 --> 38:44.752
I've tried before.

38:44.754 --> 38:46.487
Actually, this may help.

38:51.226 --> 38:52.293
[Chuckles] Oh.

38:54.562 --> 38:55.963
"Dugout chew bubble gum."

38:55.965 --> 38:57.898
"Chew, spit, and adjust"

38:57.900 --> 39:00.067
"like the real big league ball players."

39:00.069 --> 39:02.236
Well, I don't know
about that last one, but...

39:02.238 --> 39:03.537
thank you.

39:06.107 --> 39:09.009
I didn't see your message
until I got out of bed.

39:09.011 --> 39:10.444
I've never done that before.

39:10.446 --> 39:12.012
I am so sorry.

39:12.014 --> 39:13.914
Wait, you're sorry
about not answering the phone

39:13.916 --> 39:16.283
in the middle of the night
on your day off?

39:16.285 --> 39:17.951
Is that crazy?

39:17.953 --> 39:19.353
It's a little crazy.

39:19.355 --> 39:20.854
You have nothing to feel guilty about.

39:20.856 --> 39:22.556
[Laughs]

39:22.558 --> 39:24.058
Or do you?

39:24.060 --> 39:25.993
No.

39:43.514 --> 39:46.515
[Distant siren]

39:56.325 --> 39:58.360
I'll make a call, okay?

39:58.362 --> 40:00.162
I'll see if something else is available.

40:00.164 --> 40:01.563
- I love it.
- Me too.

40:01.565 --> 40:03.198
It's gonna be perfect.

40:06.135 --> 40:08.070
So convenient.

40:08.072 --> 40:11.006
Surrounded by other students and...

40:11.008 --> 40:12.774
and it's all mine.

40:12.776 --> 40:15.277
Really?

40:15.279 --> 40:18.013
What you said last night...

40:18.015 --> 40:19.414
you were right.

40:19.416 --> 40:21.983
I want to start from scratch,

40:21.985 --> 40:25.687
and part of that is having my own space.

40:25.689 --> 40:28.090
I don't want to live in the past anymore.

40:28.092 --> 40:32.160
I'm... ready to start my future.

40:37.600 --> 40:39.000
This is gonna be great.

40:39.002 --> 40:41.036
I know.

41:02.291 --> 41:03.525
Do you have another patient for me?

41:03.527 --> 41:07.162
Uh, no. I'm here for me.

41:07.164 --> 41:09.498
Hank... I hate to break this to you,

41:09.500 --> 41:10.999
but, uh...

41:11.001 --> 41:13.135
I think you need a big boy doctor.

41:13.137 --> 41:14.603
[Chuckles]

41:14.605 --> 41:16.204
I just can't find the hidden lobster.

41:18.174 --> 41:19.207
[Grunts]

41:22.044 --> 41:23.845
What's this?

41:23.847 --> 41:25.647
It's a backstage pass to Ava's concert

41:25.649 --> 41:27.549
at Madison Square Garden.

41:27.551 --> 41:29.551
Oh, my God.

41:29.553 --> 41:31.520
What's the catch?

41:31.522 --> 41:33.655
No catch.

41:36.225 --> 41:38.326
Yet you're still here.

41:38.328 --> 41:41.463
I am.

41:41.465 --> 41:42.697
I been thinking about what you said,

41:42.699 --> 41:46.201
about who you wanted in your life...

41:46.203 --> 41:47.669
someone who has a life,

41:47.671 --> 41:50.438
someone who's not a workaholic.

41:50.440 --> 41:55.577
Someone who gives me
backstage passes to see Ava.

41:55.579 --> 41:59.648
I know I'm a doctor, but...

41:59.650 --> 42:02.284
I think I can be that guy.

42:02.286 --> 42:06.788
I want to be that guy.

42:06.790 --> 42:09.057
