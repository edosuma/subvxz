(mellow music playing)

01:04.834 --> 01:06.100
Good morning, Ma.

01:06.500 --> 01:07.533
How you feeling?

01:07.600 --> 01:10.133
What did we have for dinner last night?

01:10.200 --> 01:12.600
-Mexican.
-Oh. Then I'm ok.

01:15.300 --> 01:16.567
Hi, girls.

01:21.367 --> 01:22.834
Guess where I'm going.

01:24.100 --> 01:26.400
A sanitarium up north?

01:27.500 --> 01:31.266
I'm entering the US Senior sports classic,
and I'm going to win.

01:31.333 --> 01:34.333
I had no idea you could skate that well.

01:34.400 --> 01:38.400
When I was young,
my folks had me train for the US Team.

01:39.433 --> 01:44.500
The day the Olympic committee
came to St. Olaf, I was so nervous.

01:44.567 --> 01:47.333
-I put my skates on the wrong feet.
-Oh...

01:48.734 --> 01:50.667
Sonja Henderfinken's.

01:53.133 --> 01:54.967
-Morning, all.
-Good morning.

01:55.033 --> 01:59.233
Oh, Rose, for God's sake.
You look like a giant Elf.

02:00.934 --> 02:02.700
Can I borrow that sometime?

02:04.333 --> 02:06.166
Oh, Blanche, when is Becky coming?

02:06.233 --> 02:08.967
I want to make sure
ma's moved into my room.

02:09.033 --> 02:10.567
I'm picking her up at 10:30.

02:10.633 --> 02:13.700
When company comes,
I always sleep with Dorothy.

02:13.767 --> 02:17.333
-How come I always get the short stick?
-Because you are the short stick.

02:18.166 --> 02:20.166
-Put that down.
-Why?

02:20.233 --> 02:24.033
Since you're sleeping with me,
no more liquid till Becky leaves.

02:25.900 --> 02:28.066
I'm really looking forward
to Becky's visit,

02:28.133 --> 02:30.567
even though she is
in a delicate condition.

02:30.633 --> 02:33.600
Yeah. Knocked up and single,
how dainty.

02:36.900 --> 02:41.200
I think it's great that she's brave enough
to have that baby by herself.

02:41.266 --> 02:44.367
Look who's talking,
the president of knocked up and single.

02:45.333 --> 02:47.834
But at least Dorothy's
pregnancy was an accident.

02:47.900 --> 02:52.100
My daughter did it on purpose
and went to a sperm bank.

02:52.166 --> 02:54.333
A sperm bank.

02:55.367 --> 02:58.300
Just the very idea of a bank having
sperm...

03:00.133 --> 03:02.734
At least the government
didn't have to bail them out.

03:04.367 --> 03:06.800
Well, I'm off to sign up.
Wish me luck.

03:06.867 --> 03:10.433
I think it's wonderful you're taking part
in this senior sports classic.

03:10.500 --> 03:15.333
You know, I might try entering it myself
in 15 years, when I'm eligible.

03:17.000 --> 03:18.967
If I can come up with an event.

03:19.033 --> 03:22.533
The luge is the only one
where you get to lie on your back.

03:24.467 --> 03:28.934
(calm music playing)

03:42.867 --> 03:44.333
Rose, are you all right?

03:44.400 --> 03:47.867
Yes. Oh, Mr. Ninervini,
my ice skating coach,

03:47.934 --> 03:50.734
said I should wear weights
to strengthen my ankles.

03:55.300 --> 03:57.800
I'm off to the grocery.
Can I bring you anything?

03:58.266 --> 04:00.033
Is that as fast as you can go?

04:00.667 --> 04:03.567
-Yes.
-Don't get any dairy.

04:07.266 --> 04:09.600
Rose, don't make fun of old people.

04:10.800 --> 04:13.467
I'm wearing weights
to strengthen my ankles.

04:13.533 --> 04:15.300
They come in headbands?

04:17.900 --> 04:21.100
-Everybody, look who's here.
-Oh, Becky.

04:21.166 --> 04:25.133
-Oh, sweetheart, sit down, sit down.
-Sit down.

04:25.200 --> 04:27.367
-Oh.
-Oh, you look beautiful.

04:27.433 --> 04:28.533
How have you been?

04:28.600 --> 04:32.433
Well, I love being pregnant,
except for the hormones.

04:32.500 --> 04:36.033
-Yesterday I cried when the mail was late.
-Aw.

04:36.100 --> 04:39.266
No, her mail was late.

04:42.000 --> 04:45.166
Can you imagine what she was like
when she had hormones?

04:46.400 --> 04:50.033
-So we only get you for three days.
-That depends.

04:50.100 --> 04:52.100
-On what?
-On how my mother feels

04:52.166 --> 04:54.266
about my having the baby in Miami.

04:54.734 --> 04:57.467
Here, so close to Cuba?

05:01.266 --> 05:03.033
I thought I could do it alone,

05:03.100 --> 05:05.500
but now that it's almost time,
I'm getting nervous,

05:05.567 --> 05:08.667
and I want to be near my mother.

05:09.200 --> 05:13.567
I think it's great
that you want to have your baby here.

05:13.633 --> 05:17.967
Why, in St. Olaf, the mother was always
with the daughter when she gave birth.

05:18.033 --> 05:21.467
If the mother was away,
the father's mother was there.

05:21.533 --> 05:24.900
If she was away,
then we'd call lucky Günter.

05:27.567 --> 05:29.734
What the hell?
She has a birthday coming up.

05:29.800 --> 05:31.033
Why, Rose?

05:32.767 --> 05:36.867
After the thresher accident,
they replaced lucky's arm with a forceps.

05:38.100 --> 05:39.433
Yep.

05:42.033 --> 05:44.967
Lucky Günter was in charge
of delivering babies

05:45.033 --> 05:47.367
and handing out corn
at the rotary picnics.

05:49.900 --> 05:51.233
Shut up, Rose.

05:52.767 --> 05:55.900
So, Mama, is it all right
if I have my baby here?

05:55.967 --> 05:58.967
Don't you want to have your baby

05:59.033 --> 06:02.133
with your obstetrician
in your hospital in Atlanta?

06:02.200 --> 06:06.734
I'm not having my baby in a hospital.
I'm going to a birthing center.

06:06.800 --> 06:12.600
They emphasize natural childbirth in a
relaxed atmosphere with no painkillers.

06:12.667 --> 06:18.000
I know I told you where babies come from.
Did I ever mention where they come out?

06:23.767 --> 06:26.266
Mama, why don't you
come see the place?

06:26.533 --> 06:30.633
They have one of the biggest and best
birthing centers right here in Miami.

06:30.700 --> 06:33.800
Those theme park people
are always thinking, aren't they?

06:36.300 --> 06:41.333
Oh, come on, Blanche.
The least you can do is look at the place.

06:41.400 --> 06:45.633
I'll go with you if you need support.
Just give me a head start.

06:47.800 --> 06:52.200
(serene music playing)

06:53.233 --> 06:56.166
Oh. This is a birthing center?

06:56.233 --> 06:58.900
Where's the obstetrician?
Where's the equipment?

06:58.967 --> 07:02.633
She should have the baby in your bedroom.
At least you've got stirrups.

07:07.300 --> 07:10.133
And there's a better chance
of finding a doctor.

07:11.200 --> 07:15.433
First Becky conceives in a clinic.
Now she wants to deliver in a bedroom.

07:15.500 --> 07:17.800
She's got the whole thing backwards.

07:19.133 --> 07:20.700
Oh, this is all wrong.

07:20.767 --> 07:23.200
What dope would want
to have a baby here?

07:23.266 --> 07:26.367
This place makes me
want to run out and get pregnant.

07:30.033 --> 07:31.367
We have a lot of features here

07:31.433 --> 07:34.967
to create the right environment
for both you and baby.

07:35.033 --> 07:37.567
That's why we have music
piped into every room.

07:37.633 --> 07:40.300
So, uh, Mama, what do you think?

07:40.367 --> 07:44.100
I think it would cost less
to squat in a Laura Ashley showroom.

07:45.767 --> 07:48.734
Look, I hate to be an alarmist,
but what if the baby

07:48.800 --> 07:52.367
or the mother needs more
than muzak and throw pillows?

07:52.433 --> 07:54.100
You're a meat-eater, aren't you?

07:55.767 --> 07:57.467
Aah!

07:57.533 --> 07:59.700
Sounds like there's a mommy in the making.

07:59.767 --> 08:02.300
Sounds like there's a mommy on fire.

08:03.567 --> 08:04.934
I'll be right back.

08:05.567 --> 08:08.300
-Oh, good. We can sneak out.
-Mother!

08:08.367 --> 08:12.367
Becky, I have to admit
everything is well-coordinated here,

08:12.433 --> 08:17.100
but wouldn't you be happier in a place
where there's less stereo and more--

08:17.166 --> 08:21.433
-Aah!
-Morphine?

08:25.100 --> 08:27.133
Well, I'm just looking into alternatives.

08:27.200 --> 08:29.600
Hospitals have a rigid way of doing
things.

08:29.667 --> 08:32.400
-Aah!
-Why is she screaming?

08:32.467 --> 08:33.867
She's conscious.

08:36.233 --> 08:37.800
Aah!

08:37.867 --> 08:40.867
I just want this to be an experience
I'll never forget.

08:40.934 --> 08:42.367
Aaaah!

08:46.000 --> 08:47.100
You're in luck.

08:47.166 --> 08:48.967
You're about to see
one of our deliveries.

08:49.033 --> 08:50.867
We don't need the whole tour.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.567
Mama.

08:55.033 --> 08:56.800
That sounded just awful.

08:56.867 --> 08:59.233
Well, darling, that is
woman's lot in life,

08:59.300 --> 09:00.967
to bear the pain of childbirth.

09:01.033 --> 09:04.700
-What's man's lot in life?
-Their eyebrows grow together.

09:07.100 --> 09:11.700
(mellow music playing)

09:13.467 --> 09:16.433
-Cheesecake, Rose?
-Let's taste it and find out.

09:22.300 --> 09:24.066
How's the skating going?

09:24.133 --> 09:29.233
Oh, coach Ninervini is really disappointed
in my compulsory figures.

09:29.500 --> 09:31.233
The only way I can make an 8

09:31.300 --> 09:35.567
is to start with a snowman
and then erase his head and arms.

09:36.934 --> 09:39.967
By the time I do all that,
the judges have lost interest.

09:40.600 --> 09:42.300
So have I, Rose.

09:43.133 --> 09:44.867
Honey, why don't you just quit?

09:44.934 --> 09:48.834
They have a name for people who quit.
They call them quitters.

09:51.133 --> 09:53.934
Don't let them call you that.
You make them stick to idiot.

09:57.700 --> 09:59.633
Being at the birthing center today

09:59.700 --> 10:02.400
brought back vivid memories
of when I delivered Rebecca.

10:02.834 --> 10:04.400
It was so wonderful.

10:04.467 --> 10:07.033
When I woke up,
there she was in my arms,

10:07.100 --> 10:09.767
as goofy and hung over as I was.

10:10.200 --> 10:12.633
I vowed then to have 20 more.

10:12.700 --> 10:15.600
-Well, what stopped you?
-The drugs wore off.

10:17.533 --> 10:21.433
Remember how Stan was working late
when I went into labor with Kate,

10:21.500 --> 10:23.900
-so I called you, Ma?
-Yeah.

10:24.533 --> 10:28.266
-Right in the middle of Uncle Miltie.
-Kate was born on a Friday.

10:28.333 --> 10:31.500
-Milton Berle was on Tuesdays.
-Yeah. I know.

10:31.767 --> 10:34.300
Uncle Miltie was
your father's pet name for...

10:35.033 --> 10:36.133
never mind.

10:43.033 --> 10:46.867
I was fortunate. I was at a
picnic when I delivered Kirsten.

10:46.934 --> 10:48.800
Well, how is that fortunate?

10:48.867 --> 10:51.600
Lucky Günter already had
boiling water in his corn pot.

10:53.000 --> 10:57.433
Before you knew it, I was kissing
her little buttery, salted head.

10:59.767 --> 11:01.700
Dorothy was born during
the depression.

11:02.000 --> 11:03.200
Mine.

11:04.667 --> 11:07.333
We had no money, and when
it came time to deliver,

11:07.400 --> 11:10.533
I couldn't afford to go to the hospital.
Hospitals were for the rich.

11:10.600 --> 11:11.900
So Dorothy was born at home?

11:11.967 --> 11:14.433
Homes were for the rich,
babies were for the rich.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.166
We tried selling her,
but the rich have taste.

11:19.367 --> 11:22.166
-Did you have a hard labor?
-Oh, it went on for days.

11:22.233 --> 11:23.767
But she was finally born.

11:24.200 --> 11:27.867
-Thirty-two pounds, three ounces.
-Oh, Sophia.

11:27.934 --> 11:31.767
Ma, nobody weighs 32 pounds
when they're born.

11:31.834 --> 11:33.834
That's what the guy from the circus said.

11:35.400 --> 11:37.934
-Hello.
-Hi, darling.

11:38.000 --> 11:39.633
You know, I've been thinking.

11:39.700 --> 11:43.000
Maybe having a baby at a birthing center
isn't so important.

11:43.066 --> 11:45.233
The people at Lamaze got me a coach,

11:45.300 --> 11:48.934
so I could have a natural birth
even in a hospital.

11:49.000 --> 11:53.667
Oh, Becky, that's wonderful.
And darling, I'll go to Atlanta with you.

11:53.734 --> 11:56.333
I'll be outside your door the whole time.

11:56.400 --> 11:59.133
I think I'd better
have the baby here in Miami.

11:59.200 --> 12:01.100
I don't feel much like traveling.

12:01.166 --> 12:06.166
I just thought you'd be happier giving
birth in a place where nobody knows me.

12:06.233 --> 12:07.700
I can't believe you.

12:08.033 --> 12:10.834
Will you ever get over my being
a single mother?

12:10.900 --> 12:13.567
It's just that I have a reputation
in this town.

12:13.633 --> 12:14.900
Cheesecake, Ma?

12:21.367 --> 12:25.433
-Well, I'm sorry if I embarrassed you.
-You don't sound very sorry.

12:25.500 --> 12:27.500
I had artificial insemination.

12:27.567 --> 12:29.767
It's not like I slept
with every man in town.

12:29.834 --> 12:31.767
Chew it carefully, Ma.

12:35.433 --> 12:38.166
Like they taught you at shady pines?

12:46.533 --> 12:49.867
I would just be happier
checking you into a hospital

12:49.934 --> 12:53.133
where I don't happen
to be very popular with the staff.

12:53.200 --> 12:56.934
That means more to you
than being there at my delivery.

12:57.000 --> 13:00.000
Blanche, there are
so many hospitals in Miami.

13:00.066 --> 13:03.867
Maybe you can find one where you
haven't... volunteered?

13:04.967 --> 13:07.000
No. Don't worry about it, mother.

13:07.066 --> 13:10.300
I'm leaving in the morning,
and I'm taking my baby with me.

13:14.300 --> 13:15.300
Well.

13:16.500 --> 13:20.133
(serene music playing)

13:21.600 --> 13:25.033
Little more to the left.
Little more to the left.

13:26.133 --> 13:29.400
-A little more to the left.
-Ma, Ma, wake up.

13:29.467 --> 13:31.734
Wake up, you're having a nightmare.

13:31.800 --> 13:35.700
Oh, I dreamt I was in bed with Mel Gibson,
and Kim Basinger was to my right.

13:38.266 --> 13:39.667
Go to sleep, Ma.

13:40.266 --> 13:43.500
It's been 14 hours,
just a sip of water, Dorothy.

13:43.567 --> 13:45.200
Go to sleep.

13:49.266 --> 13:50.333
Dorothy?

13:52.767 --> 13:55.100
-Dorothy?
-Becky.

13:55.633 --> 13:57.533
Becky, what's the matter? Something wrong?

13:57.600 --> 14:00.300
I was just wondering
what being in labor feels like.

14:00.367 --> 14:04.300
-How do you feel now?
-If I had any military secrets, I'd talk.

14:04.367 --> 14:05.567
Show time.

14:05.867 --> 14:08.800
Honey, now don't worry. Just lie down.
Get into bed.

14:08.867 --> 14:12.400
We'll start timing the contractions.
I think one's coming on.

14:12.767 --> 14:16.767
Oh... oh. Oh! Yikes!

14:18.266 --> 14:20.633
Blanche, cut it out.
I'm trying to get some sleep.

14:23.333 --> 14:26.200
-Ma, Becky is in labor.
-Oh.

14:27.066 --> 14:29.934
Hold my hand.
When it hurts, squeeze.

14:30.934 --> 14:34.166
-Am I crazy, or did I hear screaming?
-Yes and yes.

14:35.834 --> 14:39.433
-It's Becky. She's having the baby.
-I'll put on some corn.

14:41.467 --> 14:44.233
Call the county hospital.
Tell them we'll be there in 20 minutes.

14:44.300 --> 14:47.000
Call the coach.
The number's by the phone.

14:47.066 --> 14:48.834
Fine. Is there anything I can do?

14:49.800 --> 14:52.700
Call the hospital and the coach.
You got that, Rose?

14:52.767 --> 14:54.834
Oh, hurry. Here comes another one.

14:54.900 --> 14:58.834
Oh. Oh. Oh! Yikes!

14:59.333 --> 15:01.834
What do you do for a living,
crack walnuts?

15:01.900 --> 15:03.066
I'm sorry.

15:03.133 --> 15:05.900
-What's going on?
-Something about a baby.

15:05.967 --> 15:09.367
-Oh, my God! You mean it's started?
-She's having contractions.

15:09.433 --> 15:11.600
Mother, go back to sleep.

15:11.667 --> 15:13.433
I'll call you when it graduates
high school.

15:13.500 --> 15:17.500
Oh, don't be ridiculous.
I'm taking you to the hospital right now.

15:17.934 --> 15:20.934
Dorothy, this reminds me
of when I took you to the hospital

15:21.000 --> 15:23.300
-when you were in labor.
-How so, Ma?

15:23.567 --> 15:27.000
You were pregnant. I took you
to the hospital. It's not a big leap.

15:30.800 --> 15:33.934
Miss Devereaux,
you forgot to fill out the father's name.

15:34.000 --> 15:38.333
-I was artificially inseminated.
-It was the father's last wish.

15:41.700 --> 15:45.066
That and that people should be able
to visit Graceland.

15:48.300 --> 15:52.033
-Oh, doctor. Thank God you're here.
-I'm not the doctor. I sell hats.

15:52.100 --> 15:54.867
-Mr. Ninervini?
-Rose, who is this man?

15:54.934 --> 15:56.233
He's my ice skating...

15:56.734 --> 15:59.800
oh, my God.
I must have called the wrong coach.

16:04.233 --> 16:06.367
-Doctor?
-Yes.

16:06.433 --> 16:10.467
The contractions have been five minutes
apart for 45 minutes.

16:10.533 --> 16:15.033
-I suggest you see how dilated she is.
-Gee, I never would have thought of that.

16:16.367 --> 16:19.233
Let's get her head up
so the baby gets oxygen.

16:19.300 --> 16:23.500
-Feet up so it will be a boy.
-Raise her arms. I want a girl.

16:23.567 --> 16:25.934
-(blows whistle)
-Listen up!

16:26.500 --> 16:27.967
I want three people here,

16:28.000 --> 16:30.667
the pregnant woman,
the coach, and the baby.

16:30.734 --> 16:33.000
You heard him, ladies. Ok, doc, let's go.

16:33.066 --> 16:36.333
If anybody's staying with my daughter,
it's her mother.

16:36.400 --> 16:38.967
Blanche, we'll be right
in the waiting room.

16:39.033 --> 16:40.133
Ok.

16:40.734 --> 16:43.233
-How you doing, baby?
-I'm scared.

16:43.300 --> 16:47.734
There's nothing to be afraid of.
Just remember, pull, pull.

16:48.033 --> 16:50.600
Oh, no. That's skeet shooting. Uh...

16:50.934 --> 16:53.266
Well, never mind. We'll be just fine.

16:53.333 --> 16:56.500
Doctor, by the way,
the reason the baby's father isn't here

16:56.567 --> 16:58.500
is because, um, he's busy.

16:58.867 --> 17:00.033
I read the form.

17:00.100 --> 17:02.734
I have a pretty good idea
what he's busy doing.

17:03.400 --> 17:06.533
(calm music playing)

17:06.967 --> 17:10.934
What is taking so long?
It's been hours.

17:11.000 --> 17:13.467
It took me three and a half days
to have Dorothy.

17:14.400 --> 17:16.700
I finally coaxed her out with a pork chop.

17:18.900 --> 17:21.967
You know, Ma, you're really making me feel
bad.

17:22.033 --> 17:25.767
You keep telling me how hard it was
and how long it took to have me.

17:25.834 --> 17:29.934
-Did I mention the colic?
-Ma, you're hurting my feelings.

17:30.000 --> 17:32.333
-Not as much as you hurt my oonie.
-Ma!

17:35.500 --> 17:37.033
I'll tell you something, Dorothy.

17:37.100 --> 17:39.767
No matter how much pain I went through,

17:39.834 --> 17:42.867
I wouldn't give up having you
for anything in the world.

17:42.934 --> 17:44.233
Thanks, Ma.

17:46.567 --> 17:50.066
-And I knew you'd be special.
-And I didn't disappoint you?

17:50.133 --> 17:51.266
A little.

17:53.133 --> 17:55.600
Oh, I guess every mother feels

17:55.667 --> 17:58.800
their children are going to be something
special when they first see them.

17:58.867 --> 18:02.200
And then we disappoint them
by not becoming Olympic stars.

18:02.266 --> 18:04.100
Oh, Rose.

18:04.867 --> 18:08.533
Honey, is that why you're training,
for your parents?

18:08.600 --> 18:11.834
They always wanted me
to be a champion ice skater.

18:11.900 --> 18:14.266
They were so proud watching me practice.

18:14.333 --> 18:18.967
Their dream was for me to win a gold
medal, but I hate ice skating.

18:19.033 --> 18:22.667
Rose, you don't have to do anything
to please your parents.

18:22.734 --> 18:24.033
She's right.

18:24.100 --> 18:26.333
I'd like to be proud of Dorothy
for something,

18:26.400 --> 18:29.266
but I won't kill myself
if that day never comes.

18:30.367 --> 18:33.033
But my parents called me twinkle toes.

18:33.100 --> 18:34.767
I called Dorothy bigfoot...

18:36.133 --> 18:39.300
but that doesn't mean she has to make
tracks all over the northwest.

18:39.934 --> 18:43.967
What ma is trying to say
is she loves me for what I am.

18:44.033 --> 18:46.533
That's right,
an over-the-hill schoolteacher

18:46.600 --> 18:49.533
who has to wait for the phone to ring
to know if she'll work that day.

18:51.066 --> 18:54.066
Oh, it doesn't matter
what your parents want.

18:54.133 --> 18:56.367
Rose, you're never going
to make them happy.

18:56.433 --> 19:01.867
They're just going to nag you and nag you
until you want to choke them,

19:01.934 --> 19:06.333
but you don't because you're in a hospital
with resuscitating equipment!

19:12.400 --> 19:14.967
In other words, Rose, hang up the skates.

19:15.033 --> 19:18.633
Oh, Sophia, bigfoot, thank you.

19:21.033 --> 19:25.633
You're terrific. You made me realize
you don't have to please your parents.

19:25.700 --> 19:27.533
I don't know how I can thank you.

19:28.033 --> 19:29.967
No more ice skating.

19:30.033 --> 19:33.200
And I'm not going to go over Niagara falls
in a barrel.

19:33.700 --> 19:35.567
No, Rose. That you should do.

19:39.066 --> 19:43.767
7... 8... 9... 10.

19:43.834 --> 19:46.300
Good, good, good.
We're getting there. Rest.

19:47.033 --> 19:48.834
You're doing fine.

19:55.600 --> 19:57.900
You know why I call you pussycat,
pussycat?

19:58.400 --> 19:59.467
Why, Ma?

19:59.767 --> 20:02.734
Because you only gave me yarn
for Christmas?

20:05.200 --> 20:07.734
Because you fed me once,
and I hung around?

20:10.967 --> 20:13.300
Because you used to put me out at night?

20:16.867 --> 20:20.400
Because I love pussycats,
and I love you.

20:26.300 --> 20:28.867
And you were the only one in the family
who could catch mice.

20:33.967 --> 20:36.266
9... 10.

20:36.333 --> 20:38.400
Rest. Good, good. We're getting there.

20:38.467 --> 20:41.633
I don't think I can
take much more of this.

20:43.834 --> 20:47.834
Becky, if you hurry and have this baby,
I'll run down and get you some ice cream.

20:49.166 --> 20:51.700
When will you stop treating me
like a child?

20:51.767 --> 20:54.467
Oh, somebody's grumpy.

20:56.934 --> 20:58.333
I want her out of here.

20:58.400 --> 21:02.600
-Becky, you don't mean that.
-Right. I'm in a joking mood. Get out.

21:02.667 --> 21:05.133
-Becky.
-You're not helping, Mama.

21:05.500 --> 21:09.734
Well, then, I will
just take a little break.

21:09.800 --> 21:13.233
-Oh! Mama!
-Oh, I'm here, baby, I'm here!

21:13.734 --> 21:16.200
-One more push, and we'll be there.
-No. I can't.

21:16.266 --> 21:20.200
Becky, I've never been real strict
with you, but you have to.

21:20.266 --> 21:23.600
I'll just carry this baby with me
for the rest of my life.

21:24.600 --> 21:26.600
No. It's a bad look.

21:27.333 --> 21:29.300
I can't, Mama. I can't!

21:29.367 --> 21:31.500
Listen, Rebecca Devereaux,

21:31.567 --> 21:34.100
I think you must be
the bravest woman alive.

21:34.166 --> 21:35.367
You do?

21:35.433 --> 21:40.233
I couldn't do what you're doing.
You've got courage I never had.

21:40.300 --> 21:44.266
You decided how you wanted
to have your baby, and you're doing it!

21:44.333 --> 21:47.300
I think that's wonderful!
I'm just so proud of you.

21:47.934 --> 21:49.900
I just love you.

21:49.967 --> 21:54.767
-All right. One more push, but that's it!
-Attagirl.

21:54.834 --> 21:58.533
Come on, come on, darling.
Do your best, baby!

21:58.600 --> 22:02.033
Aah!

22:02.100 --> 22:03.900
-(baby cries)
-Oh!

22:03.967 --> 22:08.200
Oh, my God.
Would you just look at him!

22:08.266 --> 22:11.333
Mrs. Devereaux, that's the umbilical cord.

22:11.400 --> 22:12.800
Oh.

22:15.100 --> 22:17.633
Oh. Oh, well, look at her.

22:17.700 --> 22:22.467
-Oh, look at this, Becky.
-She's wonderful.

22:22.533 --> 22:23.800
Oh, my gosh.

22:23.867 --> 22:28.734
-She's almost as beautiful as you were.
-Oh, we did it, Mama. We did it.

22:28.800 --> 22:31.533
Thank you for letting me be here with you.

22:31.600 --> 22:33.767
I couldn't have done it without you.

22:34.200 --> 22:36.133
The first time I held you,

22:36.200 --> 22:40.600
I knew I was holding somebody I'd love
for the rest of my life.

22:41.567 --> 22:45.200
Hello, little baby.
We've been waiting for you.

22:54.000 --> 22:59.767
(theme music playing)
