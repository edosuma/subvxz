09:20.291 --> 09:21.792
I THINK WE'RE DONE HERE.

09:21.834 --> 09:23.709
WHAT?

09:23.750 --> 09:26.709
WELL, YOU'VE BEEN COMING
TO SEE ME FOR FIVE YEARS,

09:26.750 --> 09:29.041
SOMETIMES MORE THAN
ONCE A WEEK.

09:29.083 --> 09:30.875
NOW YOU'RE OFF YOUR MEDS.

09:30.917 --> 09:32.875
YOU MOVED OUT
OF YOUR AUNT'S HOUSE.

09:32.917 --> 09:34.500
YOU HAVE AN APARTMENT
AND A JOB NOW.

09:34.542 --> 09:36.083
YOU'RE APPLYING
TO COOKING SCHOOLS.

09:36.125 --> 09:38.709
YEAH, BUT, UM,
DOES THAT MEAN THAT I--

09:38.750 --> 09:41.875
HOLLY, LAST MONTH, YOU VISITED
YOUR BOYFRIEND'S PARENTS.

09:41.917 --> 09:44.041
YOU WERE ABLE
TO SIT AND TALK WITH THEM

09:44.083 --> 09:46.041
FOR THE FIRST TIME
SINCE HE DIED.

09:46.083 --> 09:48.166
THAT'S THE FINAL STEP
ON YOUR GOAL LIST.

09:48.208 --> 09:51.625
AND LISTENING TO YOU NOW,
I...

09:51.667 --> 09:54.041
I THINK IT'S TIME.

09:54.083 --> 09:56.417
I THINK YOU'RE READY
TO GRADUATE.

09:56.458 --> 09:59.125
I THINK YOU CAN DO THIS
ON YOUR OWN.

10:01.083 --> 10:02.500
GREAT.

10:02.542 --> 10:04.333
GREAT.

10:06.083 --> 10:07.208
(bell dings)

10:07.250 --> 10:08.500
HEY! (chuckles)

10:08.542 --> 10:10.041
RIGHT ON TIME
AS USUAL, HUH?

10:10.083 --> 10:12.417
MM, PUNCTUALITY'S IMPORTANT...

10:12.458 --> 10:14.041
ESPECIALLY NOW.
ESPECIALLY NOW. (laughs)

10:14.083 --> 10:15.083
I KNEW YOU WERE GONNA
MAKE A JOKE,

10:15.125 --> 10:16.750
BUT I-I WANTED
TO BEAT YOU TO IT.

10:16.792 --> 10:18.208
(laughs)

10:18.250 --> 10:20.083
HEY. MIRANDA!

10:20.125 --> 10:22.125
MIRANDA.
ROLL HER ON HER SIDE.

10:22.166 --> 10:23.542
(Charlotte)
I GOT HER AIRWAY.

10:23.583 --> 10:25.333
SOMEONE CALL THE PARAMEDICS.
I NEED 10 OF LORAZEPAM.

10:26.959 --> 10:28.041
SHE HASN'T SEIZED BEFORE.

10:28.083 --> 10:30.125
WE'RE GONNA TAKE CARE OF HER,
SHELDON.

10:34.083 --> 10:36.000
YOU OKAY?

10:37.417 --> 10:39.917
I KNEW IT WAS STAGE IV.
IT WAS ALWAYS STAGE IV.

10:39.959 --> 10:43.083
SO THIS WAS INEVITABLE,
BUT...

10:43.125 --> 10:46.959
KNOWING IT ISN'T THE SAME
AS... KNOWING IT.

10:48.792 --> 10:51.709
SHE'S REALLY DYING NOW.

10:51.750 --> 10:53.750
(baby crying)
(Cooper) IT'S OPEN.

10:53.792 --> 10:55.041
HEY.

10:55.083 --> 10:58.583
I COME BEARING SHRIMP CHOW FUN
AND FORTUNE COOKIES.

10:58.625 --> 11:00.041
(door closes)

11:00.083 --> 11:01.375
(Violet) WOW.

11:01.417 --> 11:02.583
YOU HAVE NO IDEA, OKAY?

11:02.625 --> 11:04.041
I HAVE TO FEED
ALL THREE OF 'EM.

11:04.083 --> 11:05.959
BY THE TIME I GET
TO THE LAST ONE,

11:06.000 --> 11:07.500
THE FIRST ONE IS HUNGRY
AND CRYING AGAIN,

11:07.542 --> 11:09.041
AND THEY'VE STARTED--

11:09.083 --> 11:10.291
THEY'VE STARTED THIS CRAZY
SYNCHRONIZED POOPING.

11:10.333 --> 11:12.709
NO, NO. I SWEAR TO GOD.
I THINK THEY GAVE A SIGNAL.

11:12.750 --> 11:14.083
ONE OF THEM POOPS...
COOPER...

11:14.125 --> 11:15.959
AND THEN
THE OTHER ONE POOPS...
I FEEL LIKE YOU NEED TO...

11:16.000 --> 11:19.375
AND THE OTHER ONE POOPS.
(whispers) SIT DOWN
AND TAKE A BREATH, OKAY?

11:19.417 --> 11:21.917
(chuckles)

11:21.959 --> 11:23.834
THEY'RE EVIL
AND THEY'RE WORKING TOGETHER,

11:23.875 --> 11:26.166
AND... (whispers) I THINK
CAROLINE'S THE RINGLEADER.
(chuckles)

11:28.125 --> 11:29.625
I HATE THEM, VIOLET.

11:29.667 --> 11:30.834
YOU DON'T HATE THEM.

11:30.875 --> 11:32.333
NO, I LOVE THEM.
THEY'RE MY KIDS.

11:32.375 --> 11:34.041
BUT HOW DO PEOPLE DO THIS?
I MEAN, FOR YEARS

11:34.083 --> 11:36.125
I'VE BEEN YAMMERING ON
TO EXHAUSTED PARENTS

11:36.166 --> 11:37.667
ABOUT WHAT A MIRACLE TIME
THIS IS.

11:37.709 --> 11:39.041
I'M SURPRISED
NO ONE'S DECKED ME.

11:39.083 --> 11:40.875
IT IS A MIRACLE.

11:40.917 --> 11:42.250
YOU'VE BEEN WAITIN'
YOUR WHOLE LIFE FOR THIS.
I KNOW.

11:42.291 --> 11:44.250
AND I TOLD CHARLOTTE I WOULD
STAY AT HOME AND RAISE THEM,

11:44.291 --> 11:45.792
BUT NOW...

11:45.834 --> 11:48.834
BUT I CAN'T HANDLE IT
AND I'M ABOUT TO SNAP, VIOLET.

11:48.875 --> 11:51.208
SO WHAT DO I DO?
WHAT AM I SUPPOSED TO DO?

11:51.250 --> 11:54.333
YOU KNOW WHAT TO DO.

11:54.375 --> 11:56.000
YOU'RE GONNA TELL ME
TO TALK TO CHARLOTTE.

11:56.041 --> 11:57.583
(whispers) YOUR FATHER'S
FINALLY LEARNING.

11:57.625 --> 11:59.166
(gasps)

11:59.208 --> 12:00.917
(bell dings)

12:03.083 --> 12:04.583
YOU DIDN'T HAVE TO
TAKE A CAB.

12:04.625 --> 12:06.583
OH, YOU WERE WORKING.
YOU KNOW...

12:06.625 --> 12:07.917
WELL, I WOULD'VE
COME AND GOTTEN YOU

12:07.959 --> 12:09.208
AND TAKE THE DAY OFF,
HAD I KNOWN YOU WERE COMING.

12:09.250 --> 12:10.417
THIS IS VERY MOMENTOUS.

12:10.458 --> 12:11.625
YOU HAVEN'T VISITED
IN TWO YEARS,

12:11.667 --> 12:13.041
AND NOW I GOT YOU TWICE
IN THREE MONTHS?

12:13.083 --> 12:14.709
WELL, I-I HAVE TO BE
IN SAN FRANCISCO TOMORROW

12:14.750 --> 12:16.250
AND I THOUGHT, YOU KNOW,
WHY NOT...

12:16.291 --> 12:17.458
STOP OFF AND HAVE
A LITTLE DETOUR?

12:17.500 --> 12:18.709
WELL, GOOD!
SO... YEAH.

12:18.750 --> 12:20.208
COME ON. NOW LISTEN.
DO YOU WANT TO DO A LATE LUNCH

12:20.250 --> 12:21.458
OR CAN YOU WAIT TILL DINNER?

12:21.500 --> 12:23.208
'CAUSE JAKE MAKES A STEAK
SO RARE

12:23.250 --> 12:25.667
YOU CAN STILL
TALK TO THE COW.

12:27.333 --> 12:29.500
OH, HEY. YOU OKAY?

12:29.542 --> 12:30.875
YEAH.

12:30.917 --> 12:32.834
UH, YEAH. IT'S...
DON'T MENTION FOOD.

12:32.875 --> 12:34.041
ARE YOU QUEASY?

12:34.083 --> 12:35.250
YEAH. IT'S PROBABLY...
THE--THE FLIGHT.

12:35.291 --> 12:37.041
IT WAS REALLY BUMPY,
YOU KNOW?

12:37.083 --> 12:40.333
YEAH? I WAS GONNA SAY. YOU'RE
NOT PREGNANT, ARE YOU? (laughs)

12:42.083 --> 12:43.625
OH, MY...
WHAT?

12:43.667 --> 12:44.959
IS THAT...

12:45.000 --> 12:46.125
ARE YOU?

12:46.166 --> 12:47.959
(lowered voice) YES.

12:49.875 --> 12:51.709
OH! (laughs)
I'M STILL TRYING
TO GET USED TO THE IDEA,

12:51.750 --> 12:53.083
SO PLEASE DON'T TELL ANYBODY.

12:53.125 --> 12:55.917
BUT FIFE MUST BE THRILLED,
RIGHT?

12:55.959 --> 12:58.083
(chuckles nervously)
YEAH.

12:58.125 --> 13:00.208
(laughs) OH, NAI! A BABY!

13:00.250 --> 13:02.041
YEAH.
OH!
(whispers) CONGRATULATIONS.

13:02.083 --> 13:05.041
(laughing)

13:09.709 --> 13:10.959
OKAY, NAI, EVERYTHING
LOOKS GREAT. HEARTBEAT'S STRONG.

13:11.000 --> 13:13.959
LOOK, YOU CAN SEE IT.

13:14.000 --> 13:16.041
OKAY.

13:16.083 --> 13:18.000
YOU GOTTA START TALKING.

13:18.041 --> 13:20.458
SOMETHING--
SOMETHING'S WRONG.

13:20.500 --> 13:22.083
WHAT? NO, I'M HAPPY.

13:22.125 --> 13:25.375
I'M--I AM. I'M REALLY HAPPY
ABOUT THE... THE BABY.

13:25.417 --> 13:27.041
IT'S...

13:27.083 --> 13:28.583
IT'S--YOU KNOW,
IT'S JUST THAT, UH,

13:28.625 --> 13:29.917
FIFE AND I AREN'T--
AREN'T DOING WELL.

13:29.959 --> 13:31.750
WE'RE NOT...
(instrument clatters)

13:31.792 --> 13:33.542
IT'S KIND OF NOT WORKING.

13:33.583 --> 13:35.166
I THOUGHT EVERYTHING WAS GOOD.
YOU DIDN'T SAY ANYTHING.

13:35.208 --> 13:36.375
WELL, YOU WERE
GETTING MARRIED.

13:36.417 --> 13:37.959
YOU KNOW, IT'S...

13:38.000 --> 13:41.917
IT'S THAT FIFE WORKS A LOT,
AND HE--AND HE TRAVELS A LOT.

13:41.959 --> 13:43.583
HE'S A GOOD GUY. HE IS.

13:43.625 --> 13:45.500
HE'S--HE'S--HE'S JUST
A RESEARCHER FIRST.

13:45.542 --> 13:47.000
YOU KNOW, HE'S MARRIED
TO HIS WORK.

13:47.041 --> 13:48.709
WELL, ARE YOU TWO
IN COUNSELING?

13:48.750 --> 13:50.750
ADDIE, FIFE DOESN'T
LIVE WITH ME ANYMORE.

13:52.083 --> 13:53.834
WE'RE DONE.

13:53.875 --> 13:55.166
OH. I-I...

13:55.208 --> 13:56.500
I JUST THOUGHT
WITH THE BABY...

13:56.542 --> 13:58.417
WELL, YOU KNOW,
THINGS HAPPEN. HUH?

13:58.458 --> 13:59.834
(chuckles) LUCKY ME.

13:59.875 --> 14:01.041
EVERY RELATIONSHIP'S WRONG

14:01.083 --> 14:02.542
UNLESS IT'S THE RIGHT ONE,
RIGHT?

14:04.542 --> 14:06.041
UM...

14:06.083 --> 14:08.083
WHAT ABOUT, UH, YOU AND SAM?

14:08.125 --> 14:10.041
WHAT?

14:10.083 --> 14:12.291
W-WELL, WE NEVER
TALKED ABOUT IT.

14:12.333 --> 14:14.083
W-WHY DID YOU YOU GUYS
BREAK UP?

14:14.125 --> 14:15.500
OH. (sighs)

14:15.542 --> 14:17.875
NAI, UM...

14:17.917 --> 14:19.667
W-WELL, SAM--
HE DIDN'T WANT KIDS.

14:19.709 --> 14:21.208
YOU KNOW, WHICH WAS SAD
AND FRUSTRATING.

14:21.250 --> 14:23.625
BUT IN THE END, IT WAS GREAT
BECAUSE I HAVE JAKE,

14:23.667 --> 14:26.750
AND JAKE LOVES KIDS.
HE LOVES HENRY.

14:26.792 --> 14:30.458
SO IT ALL TURNED OUT
THE WAY IT WAS SUPPOSED TO.

14:30.500 --> 14:31.834
YEAH.

14:31.875 --> 14:34.125
HEY, I AM HERE FOR YOU,
ALL RIGHT?

14:34.166 --> 14:35.959
(exhales)
NO MATTER WHAT.

14:36.000 --> 14:38.000
WE'LL FIGURE THIS OUT.
OKAY. YEAH.

14:43.709 --> 14:44.667
WHAT HAPPENED?

14:44.709 --> 14:47.333
HEY. YOU'RE OKAY. ALL RIGHT.

14:47.375 --> 14:50.041
MIRANDA,
YOU HAD A SEIZURE.

14:50.083 --> 14:52.041
OH. THAT'S NEW.

14:52.083 --> 14:53.500
AMELIA HAD YOU ADMITTED.

14:53.542 --> 14:55.166
SHE SAYS YOU NEED
TO BE MONITORED.

14:55.208 --> 14:56.917
MM. I NEED TO BE
ON A BEACH SOMEWHERE,

14:56.959 --> 14:59.166
DRINKING SOMETHING
WITH AN UMBRELLA IN IT.

14:59.208 --> 15:00.583
THE SCANS SHOW THAT Y--

15:00.625 --> 15:03.792
THE SCANS SHOW THAT
I'M DYING OF CANCER. YEP.

15:03.834 --> 15:05.041
(exhales deeply)

15:05.083 --> 15:07.166
I NEED YOU TO STAY FOR
OBSERVATION, AT LEAST OVERNIGHT.

15:07.208 --> 15:09.458
OH, I DON'T REALLY THINK
THAT'S NECESSARY.

15:09.500 --> 15:11.250
MIRANDA.

15:11.291 --> 15:12.333
PLEASE.

15:15.709 --> 15:16.875
OKAY, I'LL STAY ONE NIGHT.

15:16.917 --> 15:18.583
GOOD.

15:18.625 --> 15:20.875
CAN I GET YOU ANYTHING?

15:20.917 --> 15:22.959
A CURE FOR CANCER
WOULD BE NICE.

15:28.959 --> 15:32.125
NO, YOU--YOU ARE NOT
DROPPING OUT OF SCHOOL.

15:32.166 --> 15:34.333
I'M JUST TAKING
A SEMESTER OFF.

15:34.375 --> 15:36.041
OKAY. CAN WE--CAN WE TALK
ABOUT THIS FOR A MINUTE?

15:36.083 --> 15:37.709
JUST...

15:37.750 --> 15:39.458
WHY?

15:39.500 --> 15:41.291
I WANNA GO TO EUROPE.
ROME.

15:41.333 --> 15:43.041
OKAY, I'LL SEND YOU THERE
THIS SUMMER.

15:43.083 --> 15:44.250
IT'LL BE MY TREAT.

15:44.291 --> 15:46.041
OR--OR WHAT ABOUT
STUDYING ABROAD?

15:48.750 --> 15:50.041
ELI IS TEACHING THERE
NEXT SEMESTER,

15:50.083 --> 15:51.291
AND HE ASKED ME TO COME.

15:51.333 --> 15:52.542
I'M GOING.

15:52.583 --> 15:54.417
YOU'RE MAKING A MISTAKE.

15:54.458 --> 15:56.250
I LOVE HIM.

15:56.291 --> 15:57.875
ANOTHER MISTAKE.

15:57.917 --> 15:59.542
I DON'T NEED YOUR PERMISSION.
I JUST WANTED YOU TO KNOW.

15:59.583 --> 16:01.583
LOOK, ANGELA...

16:06.083 --> 16:08.250
OH, HI. I'M SORRY.

16:08.291 --> 16:10.041
I JUST WALKED PAST
YOUR RECEPTIONIST.

16:10.083 --> 16:11.542
I'M INTERRUPTING YOU.

16:11.583 --> 16:13.000
YOU'RE IN THE MIDDLE
OF A MILLION THINGS, I'M SURE.

16:13.041 --> 16:16.083
I'M REALLY--
HOLLY, HOLLY,
TELL ME WHAT'S WRONG.

16:16.125 --> 16:17.500
I, UM, I-I GOT IN.

16:17.542 --> 16:21.250
I GOT ACCEPTED
TO LE CORDON BLEU IN PARIS.

16:21.291 --> 16:22.500
I GOT INTO

16:22.542 --> 16:24.375
THE BEST COOKING SCHOOL
IN THE WORLD.

16:24.417 --> 16:26.041
HOLLY! CONGRATULATIONS!

16:26.083 --> 16:30.041
NO, IT'S NO CONGRATULATIONS.
I CAN'T GO. IT'S IN PARIS.

16:30.083 --> 16:32.500
THIS IS WHAT YOU WANTED.
THIS IS YOUR DREAM.

16:32.542 --> 16:35.000
IT'S A BIG CHANGE,
IT IS OUT OF YOUR COMFORT ZONE,

16:35.041 --> 16:36.166
BUT YOU CAN HANDLE IT.

16:36.208 --> 16:37.583
WHAT IF SOMETHING GOES WRONG?

16:37.625 --> 16:39.375
WE'VE TALKED ABOUT
YOU BEING READY.

16:39.417 --> 16:41.917
UH, WELL, THERE'S
A 9-HOUR TIME DIFFERENCE

16:41.959 --> 16:43.917
BETWEEN THERE AND HERE.

16:43.959 --> 16:46.709
AND IT'S A WHOLE CONTINENT
AND AN OCEAN AWAY.

16:46.750 --> 16:47.959
OKAY, IT IS FAR, BUT--

16:48.000 --> 16:50.792
NO, IT'S AN ENTIRE CONTINENT
AND AN OCEAN

16:50.834 --> 16:52.375
AWAY FROM YOU.

16:52.417 --> 16:54.291
OH, HOLLY.

16:54.333 --> 16:57.500
YOU TOLD ME THAT IF I EVER
NEEDED YOU, YOU WOULD BE THERE.

16:57.542 --> 16:59.625
SO WHAT IF
SOMETHING HAPPENS,

16:59.667 --> 17:02.500
AND I NEED YOU
AND I'M IN PARIS?

17:02.542 --> 17:05.125
IT DOESN'T...
LOGICALLY MAKE SENSE.

17:05.166 --> 17:07.792
IT DOESN'T WORK.
(inhales deeply)

17:09.667 --> 17:12.625
I'M NOT GOING.
I'M NOT LEAVING THERAPY.

17:12.667 --> 17:14.250
I'M NOT READY.

17:17.083 --> 17:20.959
I MUST SAY, I HAVE MISSED
THIS KITCHEN.

17:21.000 --> 17:22.583
THIS FEELS LIKE HOME.

17:22.625 --> 17:24.041
(mouth full)
AW, YOU SHOULD STAY.

17:24.083 --> 17:25.250
I'M SERIOUS.

17:25.291 --> 17:26.875
MMM, THIS IS AMAZING.
WHAT IS THIS?

17:26.917 --> 17:29.041
KALE PASTA SALAD,
WITH HOMEMADE PASTA.

17:29.083 --> 17:30.583
WOW.
MY PATIENT HOLLY MADE IT.

17:30.625 --> 17:32.125
MMM.
YOU HAVE A MENTAL PATIENT
WHO MAKES YOU FOOD?

17:32.166 --> 17:33.250
(chuckles) CHARLOTTE.

17:33.291 --> 17:35.041
I'M SORRY.

17:35.083 --> 17:38.208
I'M CRANKY AND TIRED 'CAUSE
COPPER'S CRANKY AND TIRED.

17:38.250 --> 17:40.208
MAN GETS TO STAY HOME ALL DAY,
SWIMMING IN BABIES.

17:40.250 --> 17:43.375
YOU THINK HE'D BE HAPPY.
BUT NO, HE'S MOODY AS HELL.

17:43.417 --> 17:45.000
MY BOOBS ARE GONNA EXPLODE.
I GOTTA GO PUMP.

17:46.542 --> 17:49.041
(laughs) THINGS HAVE CERTAINLY
CHANGED AROUND HERE.

17:49.083 --> 17:50.834
YOU KNOW, YOUR MENTAL PATIENT'S
VERY TALENTED.

17:50.875 --> 17:52.041
SHE SHOULD BE A CHEF.

17:52.083 --> 17:53.250
SHE GOT ACCEPTED
TO THE CORDON BLEU...

17:53.291 --> 17:55.041
MM!
BUT SHE'S NOT GONNA GO.

17:55.083 --> 17:57.667
SHE'S AFRAID TO LEAVE THERAPY.
SHE'S AFRAID TO LEAVE ME.

17:57.709 --> 18:00.041
YOU KNOW, MAYBE I MISJUDGED.

18:00.083 --> 18:01.250
I'M GONNA LET HER
KEEP COMING IN.

18:01.291 --> 18:03.875
OH. HEY. HEY, EVERYBODY.

18:03.917 --> 18:05.041
HI.

18:05.083 --> 18:06.500
(chuckles) HEY. YEAH.
IT'S NA--NAOMI.

18:06.542 --> 18:08.458
I DIDN'T KNOW YOU WERE...
ARE YOU--WHAT ARE YOU...

18:08.500 --> 18:11.333
UH, NO, YEAH,
I'M JUST COMING THROUGH

18:11.375 --> 18:12.542
AND I WAS VISITING ADDIE.
OH.

18:12.583 --> 18:14.875
YEAH.
THAT'S GREAT. THAT'S GREAT.

18:14.917 --> 18:16.750
HA! (mutters)

18:16.792 --> 18:18.709
OOPS. SORRY.

18:18.750 --> 18:20.333
DID YOU...
SORRY. NO, I...

18:20.375 --> 18:23.709
(laughs)
(laughs)

18:23.750 --> 18:25.041
(chairs squeaking)
SAM?

18:25.083 --> 18:26.917
YEAH? NAH, NAH.

18:26.959 --> 18:28.750
I'M NOT THAT THIR--THIRSTY.

18:36.291 --> 18:37.750
(mouth full) GIRL, HOLY CRAP.
THAT'S...

18:37.792 --> 18:39.041
THAT'S REALLY GOOD.

18:39.083 --> 18:40.625
RIGHT?
MM-HMM.

18:40.667 --> 18:43.333
SO GOOD. MM-HMM. MM-HMM.

18:44.750 --> 18:47.000
YOU'RE 13 WEEKS PREGNANT,
AREN'T YOU?

18:48.959 --> 18:50.250
W-WHAT?

18:50.291 --> 18:52.125
YEAH, YOU SHOULD KNOW. YOU JUST
DID THE ULTRASOUND TODAY.

18:52.166 --> 18:54.291
I MEAN EXACTLY 13 WEEKS,

18:54.333 --> 18:56.458
BECAUSE THAT'S WHEN
I GOT MARRIED.

18:56.500 --> 19:00.166
13 WEEKS AGO.

19:00.208 --> 19:01.291
NAOMI?

19:01.333 --> 19:02.959
(sighs)

19:05.625 --> 19:07.083
(slaps leg)
IT JUST HAPPENED.

19:07.125 --> 19:08.875
(whispers) OH!

19:08.917 --> 19:10.250
IT JUST HAPPENED.

19:10.291 --> 19:12.041
I DON'T KNOW--I DON'T EVEN KNOW
WHY IT HAPPENED.

19:12.083 --> 19:14.250
WE'RE DIVORCED. WE'RE--
WE'RE GOOD. WE'VE GOT CLOSURE.

19:14.291 --> 19:16.291
BUT IT--WE JUST SAW EACH OTHER,
AND...

19:16.333 --> 19:18.041
(sighs) OH, GOD.
I DON'T KNOW. IT'S SAM.

19:18.083 --> 19:19.375
YOU KNOW. IT'S--IT'S SAM.

19:19.417 --> 19:20.834
OKAY, MY BRAIN IS EXPLODING.

19:20.875 --> 19:22.083
WHAT, AND YOU THINK MINE ISN'T?
(speaks indistinctly)

19:22.125 --> 19:23.709
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA
TELL HIM?

19:23.750 --> 19:25.291
I'M NOT GONNA
TELL HIM ANYTHING.

19:25.333 --> 19:26.917
NAI, YOU HAVE TO!

19:26.959 --> 19:29.041
THE BABY'S GONNA COME OUT
LOOKING EXACTLY LIKE A TINY SAM.

19:29.083 --> 19:30.417
HE IS WITH STEPHANIE.

19:30.458 --> 19:32.041
AND THE REASON
YOU TWO DIDN'T WORK OUT

19:32.083 --> 19:34.041
IS BECAUSE HE DOESN'T WANT
ANY MORE KIDS, RIGHT?
(sighs)

19:34.083 --> 19:35.208
SO WHY WOULD I TELL HIM?

19:35.250 --> 19:37.500
BECAUSE HE'S SAM.

19:37.542 --> 19:39.166
I MEAN, YOU DIDN'T JUST HAVE
A ONE-NIGHT STAND

19:39.208 --> 19:40.375
WITH SOME RANDOM GUY.

19:40.417 --> 19:42.333
YOU CHOSE TO SLEEP WITH SAM.

19:42.375 --> 19:44.333
AND MAYBE THE REASON WHY THE TWO
OF YOU ENDED UP IN BED TOGETHER

19:44.375 --> 19:47.041
IS BECAUSE...
IT STILL MEANS SOMETHING.

19:47.083 --> 19:48.625
NO.

19:48.667 --> 19:52.250
NO. SAM--SAM WALKED OUT
ON OUR MARRIAGE.

19:52.291 --> 19:53.750
HE WALKED OUT. HE JUST QUIT.

19:53.792 --> 19:56.125
HE--HE DECIDED HE WAS DONE.
HE DIDN'T FIGHT FOR US.

19:56.166 --> 19:58.917
HE JUST BLEW US UP. I...

20:00.291 --> 20:02.208
AND THERE'S A HISTORY
WITH... US.

20:02.250 --> 20:04.000
YOU KNOW, I...

20:04.041 --> 20:05.041
(dish clatters)

20:05.083 --> 20:07.041
IT CAN'T MEAN ANYTHING.

20:07.083 --> 20:09.375
IT CAN'T. AND I-I CAN'T
SIT AROUND HOPING THAT IT DOES.

20:09.417 --> 20:10.667
I'M SORRY.

20:10.709 --> 20:12.458
YOU ARE IN LOVE WITH HIM,
NAOMI.

20:12.500 --> 20:13.875
YOU KNOW,
IT'S--IT'S GETTING LATE,

20:13.917 --> 20:15.041
AND I HAVE
AN EARLY FLIGHT TOMORROW,

20:15.083 --> 20:16.458
SO I GOTTA--
I GOTTA GO TO BED.

20:16.500 --> 20:19.291
NAOMI.
LEAVE IT ALONE, ADDISON.

20:23.083 --> 20:25.166
(sighs deeply)

20:28.917 --> 20:31.375
I CAN FEEL YOU STARING
AT ME.

20:31.417 --> 20:32.792
NO, I'M NOT.

20:32.834 --> 20:35.041
LOOK, ADDISON, WHATEVER
IT IS YOU'RE DYING TO SAY

20:35.083 --> 20:38.041
AND THINK YOU CAN'T SAY,
JUST SAY IT.

20:40.083 --> 20:43.375
OKAY. NAOMI SLEPT WITH SAM
ON OUR WEDDING NIGHT,

20:43.417 --> 20:46.250
AND NOW SHE'S PREGNANT
WITH SAM'S BABY.

20:47.458 --> 20:48.834
YOU CAN'T TELL SAM.

20:48.875 --> 20:51.041
I DON'T WANT TO TELL SAM.
WHY CAN'T I TELL SAM?

20:51.083 --> 20:53.834
BECAUSE IT'S NONE OF
YOUR BUSINESS. ALL RIGHT?

20:53.875 --> 20:55.250
FINE.

21:00.083 --> 21:01.375
AHEM.

21:01.417 --> 21:02.500
HI.

21:02.542 --> 21:03.709
WHEN I FIRST MOVED TO L.A.,

21:03.750 --> 21:05.917
SAM TOLD ME THAT
HE BLEW APART HIS MARRIAGE

21:05.959 --> 21:07.041
AND HE NEVER UNDERSTOOD WHY.

21:07.083 --> 21:08.250
I STILL DON'T THINK
HE UNDERSTANDS WHY.

21:08.291 --> 21:10.333
BUT NOW I THINK
THAT THE REASON WHY

21:10.375 --> 21:12.959
SAM'S NEVER BEEN ABLE TO MAKE IT
WORK WITH ANOTHER WOMAN

21:13.041 --> 21:15.458
IS BECAUSE HE'LL ALWAYS
BE IN LOVE WITH NAOMI.

21:15.500 --> 21:17.041
AND THEN ME,
WITH MY CHEATER PAST,

21:17.083 --> 21:18.250
I JUST JUMPED IN THERE

21:18.291 --> 21:20.500
AND STARTED DATING
MY BEST FRIEND'S EX-HUSBAND.

21:20.542 --> 21:22.041
AND THEN I HURT HER,
I HURT HIM.

21:22.083 --> 21:24.083
AND YOU KNOW WHAT?
HE'S NOT HAPPY WITH STEPHANIE.

21:24.125 --> 21:25.333
AND SHE LEFT FIFE.

21:25.375 --> 21:27.625
AND SO HOW IS IT FAIR
THAT I GET TO BE HAPPY,

21:27.667 --> 21:31.875
ALL MARRIED TO YOU,
HOT SAINT MAN?

21:31.917 --> 21:33.041
AND THEY'RE GONNA
BE MISERABLE

21:33.083 --> 21:35.792
BECAUSE SHE'S GOT
SUCH PRIDE,

21:35.834 --> 21:37.041
AND HE'S GOT SUCH...

21:37.083 --> 21:38.291
PREJUDICE?

21:38.333 --> 21:39.709
(groans)

21:39.750 --> 21:41.000
YOU REALIZE THIS ISN'T
A JANE AUSTEN NOVEL, RIGHT?

21:41.041 --> 21:42.041
OH, SHUT UP.

21:42.083 --> 21:43.625
YOU SHUT UP. GET IN HERE.

21:54.125 --> 21:55.083
HEY.

22:00.000 --> 22:01.667
ADDISON?
DO YOU LOVE STEPHANIE?

22:01.709 --> 22:03.041
WHAT?

22:03.083 --> 22:05.291
DO YOU... LOVE STEPHANIE?

22:05.333 --> 22:06.792
(laughs)

22:06.834 --> 22:08.166
I MEAN, I DON'T...
THAT'S NONE OF Y--

22:08.208 --> 22:10.041
I DON'T SEE HOW THAT'S ANY OF
Y--OF YOUR--UH, YOUR BUSINESS.

22:10.083 --> 22:11.291
NO, IT'S NOT.
IT'S REALLY NOT.

22:11.333 --> 22:14.583
BUT NAI...
SHE'S MY BUSINESS.

22:14.625 --> 22:16.792
(whispers) OH.

22:16.834 --> 22:18.000
(sighs)
(sets down pencil)

22:18.041 --> 22:19.583
LOOK...

22:19.625 --> 22:21.792
OKAY, WHAT HAPPENED BETWEEN
NAI AND ME...

22:21.834 --> 22:24.000
WE WERE CONFUSED.
IT WAS A MISTAKE.

22:24.041 --> 22:26.000
IT HAPPENED ONCE.
END OF STORY

22:26.041 --> 22:27.291
OKAY,
I'M GONNA SAY A THING,

22:27.333 --> 22:29.291
AND YOU CAN TAKE IT
OR LEAVE IT, WHATEVER.

22:29.333 --> 22:31.291
NAOMI AND FIFE
NEVER GOT MARRIED.

22:31.333 --> 22:33.583
THEY ARE NO LONGER TOGETHER.

22:33.625 --> 22:36.083
AND...
THAT IS ALL I'M GONNA SAY.

22:36.125 --> 22:38.959
(pats leg)
I'VE ALREADY SAID
WAY TOO MUCH.

22:39.000 --> 22:41.041
OKAY, I'M GONNA SAY
ONE MORE THING.

22:41.083 --> 22:43.583
SHE IS IN LOVE WITH YOU.
NAOMI IS STILL IN LOVE WITH YOU.

22:43.625 --> 22:46.208
AND I AM... 72% CERTAIN

22:46.250 --> 22:50.458
THAT I DID THE RIGHT THING
IN TELLING YOU THIS INFORMATION.

22:57.667 --> 22:59.250
HI.

22:59.291 --> 23:00.917
WHY ARE YOU OUT OF BED?

23:00.959 --> 23:02.041
I'M GOING HOME.

23:02.083 --> 23:04.375
NO, YOU--YOU HAVEN'T
BEEN DISCHARGED.

23:04.417 --> 23:07.041
I KNOW. THAT'S WHY I'M FILLING
OUT THIS FANCY FORM

23:07.083 --> 23:11.041
THAT SAYS I'M LEAVING AGAINST
MEDICAL ADVICE.

23:11.083 --> 23:14.000
MIRANDA. MIRANDA.

23:15.667 --> 23:17.792
I KNOW HOW YOU FEEL
ABOUT HOSPITALS,

23:17.834 --> 23:20.041
BUT... YOU SHOULD STAY.

23:20.083 --> 23:21.250
I'D BE HERE WITH YOU.

23:21.291 --> 23:24.041
YOU KNOW, EVERY--
EVERY SINGLE DAY.

23:24.083 --> 23:26.041
YOU KNOW IF I STAY HERE,

23:26.083 --> 23:27.667
THEY'RE GONNA SEND IN
ONCOLOGISTS

23:27.709 --> 23:30.083
AND RADIATION THERAPISTS
AND SURGEONS.

23:30.125 --> 23:33.583
AND THAT NO MATTER WHAT THEY DO,
THE TUMOR INSIDE MY BRAIN

23:33.625 --> 23:36.500
IS STILL GONNA DESTROY
MY ABILITY TO TALK AND WALK

23:36.542 --> 23:38.792
AND GO TO THE BATHROOM.

23:38.834 --> 23:40.792
BEFORE YOU KNOW IT,
I'M GONNA BE THROWING UP

23:40.834 --> 23:42.667
AND WEARING DIAPERS,

23:42.709 --> 23:46.041
AND I'M NOT GONNA REMEMBER
YOUR NAME.

23:46.083 --> 23:47.417
I'M GONNA BE IN SO MUCH PAIN,

23:47.458 --> 23:49.041
THEY'RE GONNA PLY ME
WITH MORPHINE,

23:49.083 --> 23:52.417
WHICH WILL MAKE ME NUMB,
AND THAT WILL MAKE ME DROOL.

23:52.458 --> 23:53.834
AND THERE'S SO MUCH MORE--

23:53.875 --> 23:57.041
A THOUSAND OTHER
HORRIBLE INDIGNITIES

23:57.083 --> 23:59.083
I JUST HAVEN'T
THOUGHT OF YET.

23:59.125 --> 24:02.750
SO I DON'T REALLY WANNA SPEND
MY LAST DAYS HERE.

24:02.792 --> 24:04.333
CAN YOU...

24:04.375 --> 24:06.542
UNDERSTAND THAT?

24:06.583 --> 24:08.542
OKAY.

24:08.583 --> 24:10.542
OKAY. I'LL--I'LL TAKE YOU HOME.
I'LL TAKE CARE OF YOU.

24:10.583 --> 24:12.542
(scoffs) NO. I DON'T WANT YOU
TO TAKE CARE OF ME, SHELDON.

24:12.583 --> 24:15.959
I DON'T YOU CHANGING
MY DIAPERS.

24:16.000 --> 24:18.000
OKAY.

24:18.041 --> 24:20.542
IF YOU NEED TO, WE--WE CAN
GET YOU A PRIVATE NURSE.

24:20.583 --> 24:22.000
LOOK, YOU'VE COME
THIS FAR WITH ME,

24:22.041 --> 24:23.375
AND I REALLY APPRECIATE THAT.

24:23.417 --> 24:25.333
(inhales and exhales deeply)

24:25.375 --> 24:29.792
BUT THIS IS THE LAST LEG
OF A REALLY LONG JOURNEY.

24:29.834 --> 24:32.166
AND THE GOOD PART IS OVER NOW
AND THE BAD PART IS STARTING,

24:32.208 --> 24:36.000
AND I DON'T WANT YOU WITH ME.
I DON'T WANT YOU TO SEE THIS.

24:37.834 --> 24:40.000
NO.

24:40.041 --> 24:43.041
I WANT YOU TO WALK AWAY

24:43.083 --> 24:44.333
AND NOT LOOK BACK.

24:44.375 --> 24:48.375
I-I WANT YOU TO GO
WHILE I CAN...

24:48.417 --> 24:49.917
STILL REMEMBER HOW MUCH...

24:49.959 --> 24:51.083
(kisses)

24:51.125 --> 24:52.583
(voice breaks) I LOVE YOU.

24:52.625 --> 24:56.083
IF YOU CARE ABOUT ME AT ALL,

24:56.125 --> 24:58.041
YOU WILL DO THIS FOR ME.

24:58.083 --> 25:00.458
PLEASE.

25:00.500 --> 25:03.125
JUST GO.

25:03.166 --> 25:06.834
(stomps foot)
(crying) JUST WALK AWAY,
SHELDON. JUST GO.

25:08.417 --> 25:11.041
FINE, THEN I'LL WALK AWAY.

25:11.083 --> 25:12.208
(sobs)

25:23.208 --> 25:24.375
(sighs)

25:24.417 --> 25:26.625
(door opens)

25:26.667 --> 25:28.583
OH, THANK GOD. MOM'S HOME.
(Charlotte sighs)

25:28.625 --> 25:30.000
(door closes)

25:30.041 --> 25:32.166
HOW ARE MY BABIES?

25:32.208 --> 25:33.583
SHH!
SHH!

25:33.625 --> 25:35.750
THEY'RE ASLEEP.
LOWER YOU VOICE.

25:35.792 --> 25:38.417
(sighs) LORD, AM I BEAT.

25:38.458 --> 25:42.000
I FORGET HOW BEING
ON, UH, YOUR FEET ALL DAY

25:42.041 --> 25:43.583
CAN REALLY TAKE IT
OUT OF YA.

25:43.625 --> 25:44.792
(grunts) YOU BARELY FINISH UP
WITH ONE PATIENT

25:44.834 --> 25:46.041
BEFORE ANOTHER ONE NEEDS YA.

25:46.083 --> 25:48.000
(shoes thud)

25:49.667 --> 25:51.458
(sighs)
WE NEED TO HIRE A NANNY.

25:51.500 --> 25:54.000
WHAT? NO.

25:54.041 --> 25:55.959
NO?

25:56.000 --> 25:57.166
THE DEAL WAS YOU'D STAY HOME
WITH THE KIDS

25:57.208 --> 25:58.667
AND I'D GO BACK TO WORK.

25:58.709 --> 26:01.083
I'M NOT CHANGING THINGS JUST
'CAUSE YOU HAD A ROUGH DAY.

26:01.125 --> 26:02.667
AH.

26:04.417 --> 26:05.625
RUN.

26:09.625 --> 26:11.166
YOU SEE THIS SHIRT?

26:11.208 --> 26:13.667
I DON'T KNOW
IF THESE STAINS ARE

26:13.709 --> 26:16.208
VOMIT OR BREAST MILK ANYMORE

26:16.250 --> 26:18.417
BECAUSE I'VE BEEN WEARING IT
FOR FIVE DAYS.

26:18.458 --> 26:19.625
FIVE.

26:19.667 --> 26:20.834
I KNOW THAT TO BE TRUE

26:20.875 --> 26:22.041
BECAUSE I HAVEN'T HAD A SHOWER
IN FIVE DAYS.

26:22.083 --> 26:24.458
I'M PRETTY SURE LAST NIGHT
I FELL ASLEEP IN CLOSET,

26:24.500 --> 26:26.625
LOOKING FOR DIAPERS.
AND I DON'T KNOW HOW

26:26.667 --> 26:28.041
TO HAVE A CONVERSATION
WITH ADULTS ANYMORE UNLESS IT'S

26:28.083 --> 26:29.709
THE OTHER SLEEPY-DEPRIVED MOMS
IN THE PARK.

26:29.750 --> 26:31.875
AND BY THE WAY,
AFTER I BOND WITH THEM

26:31.917 --> 26:33.291
OVER THE PSYCHOSIS THAT COMES

26:33.333 --> 26:35.834
WITH BEING YOUR CHILD'S
PRIMARY CAREGIVER,

26:35.875 --> 26:37.208
I'LL EVENTUALLY HAVE SEX
WITH ONE OF THEM

26:37.250 --> 26:39.750
BECAUSE THEY'RE, YOU KNOW,
ON THE SAME FEEDING SCHEDULE.

26:39.792 --> 26:43.041
IS THAT WHAT YOU WANT, ME HAVING
SEX WITH MOMS IN THE PARK?

26:43.083 --> 26:45.458
BECAUSE THAT'S WHERE
THIS IS HEADED.

26:45.500 --> 26:47.875
WE NEED TO HIRE A NANNY.

26:50.250 --> 26:52.375
(sighs)

26:54.083 --> 26:57.250
(exhales deeply)

26:57.291 --> 26:58.750
YOU WANNA WATCH A MOVIE?

26:58.792 --> 27:01.291
UH, SURE.

27:01.333 --> 27:05.041
OR WE CAN GO TO A MOVIE.

27:05.083 --> 27:06.500
UH... (sighs) WHATEVER
YOU WANT TO DO.

27:06.542 --> 27:09.000
(laughs) SAM, WHY AM I HERE?

27:11.083 --> 27:12.500
WE'RE--WE'RE... (laughs)
WE'RE HANGING OUT.

27:12.542 --> 27:15.166
YET YOU HAVEN'T HEARD
A WORD I'VE SAID.

27:15.208 --> 27:18.709
(sighs)

27:18.750 --> 27:21.542
I'M SORRY. YOU'RE RIGHT.

27:21.583 --> 27:23.000
(inhales deeply)

27:23.041 --> 27:24.333
UH... (exhales)

27:24.375 --> 27:27.709
I HAVEN'T HEARD A WORD
YOU'VE SAID BECAUSE, UH...

27:30.792 --> 27:32.041
I'M TRYING TO FIGURE OUT

27:32.083 --> 27:35.125
HOW I'M GONNA SAY
WHAT I NEED TO SAY TO YOU.

27:35.166 --> 27:38.166
THEN JUST SAY IT.
WHATEVER IT IS, JUST SAY IT.

27:40.083 --> 27:43.375
OKAY. WELL, WHEN WE...

27:43.417 --> 27:48.041
THE FIRST TIME
WE GOT TOGETHER, UH...

27:48.083 --> 27:51.166
YOU BROKE UP WITH ME.
YOU--YOU SAID I WAS A MESS.

27:51.208 --> 27:54.041
AND, UH, I DIDN'T SEE IT.

27:54.083 --> 27:56.041
WELL, I GUESS YOU DON'T
SEE THINGS UNTIL...

27:56.083 --> 27:58.625
(sighs)
YOU'RE READY TO SEE THEM.

27:58.667 --> 28:01.041
BUT YOU SAID I WAS A MESS,

28:01.083 --> 28:02.583
AND YOU WERE RIGHT.

28:02.625 --> 28:05.125
BUT NOW I--
OKAY, STOP.

28:05.166 --> 28:07.041
JUST, UM...

28:07.083 --> 28:08.166
JUST STOP.

28:08.208 --> 28:10.959
(sighs)

28:11.000 --> 28:12.208
OKAY. (sighs)

28:12.250 --> 28:14.333
(chuckles)

28:14.375 --> 28:15.792
I'M GONNA GO NOW

28:15.834 --> 28:19.083
BECAUSE I DO NOT WANT YOU TO
SEE ME CRY.

28:21.208 --> 28:22.375
(sighs)

28:22.417 --> 28:24.000
I'M SO SORRY, STEPHANIE.
I DON'T...

28:24.041 --> 28:25.792
I'M SORRY.
(voice breaking)
SAM, YOU'RE A GOOD GUY,

28:25.834 --> 28:28.125
BUT LET ME GIVE YOU
A LITTLE ADVICE.

28:28.166 --> 28:30.458
THE NEXT TIME YOU TRY TO GET
A SECOND CHANCE WITH A WOMAN,

28:30.500 --> 28:32.166
YOU BETTER MEAN IT,

28:32.208 --> 28:34.667
BECAUSE WE'RE NOT
AS TOUGH AS WE LOOK, OKAY?

28:37.083 --> 28:40.041
AND I LIKED HER--
YOUR EX-WIFE.

28:40.083 --> 28:43.041
(crying) WHEN I MET HER,
I LIKED HER.

28:43.083 --> 28:44.250
CRAP.

28:44.291 --> 28:47.250
AND NOW I'M CRYING.

28:47.291 --> 28:49.041
AND NOW YOU'RE GONNA COME OVER
HERE AND COMFORT ME,

28:49.083 --> 28:51.750
AND I-I HATE YOU.

28:54.917 --> 28:57.208
(sobs)

29:01.291 --> 29:02.375
SO I'VE BEEN WORKING
ON SHELLFISH,

29:02.417 --> 29:04.041
AND UM, PEOPLE THINK
THAT IT'S EASY TO DO,

29:04.083 --> 29:05.625
BUT PEOPLE ACTUALLY DON'T REALLY
KNOW WHAT THEY'RE TALKING ABOUT

29:05.667 --> 29:07.125
'CAUSE IT'S DIFFICULT TO DO.

29:07.166 --> 29:10.208
THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS
THAT YOU HAVE TO KNOW ABOUT.
HOLLY. HOLLY.

29:10.250 --> 29:12.000
THIS IS GONNA BE
OUR LAST SESSION.

29:12.041 --> 29:13.166
IF YOU CALL THE OFFICE,

29:13.208 --> 29:15.041
THE RECEPTIONIST IS NOT GONNA
ALLOW YOU TO BOOK ANOTHER ONE.

29:15.083 --> 29:17.041
WHY?
BECAUSE YOU DON'T NEED ME
ANYMORE.

29:17.083 --> 29:18.750
YOU'RE IN SUCH A GOOD PLACE.

29:18.792 --> 29:20.208
YOU'RE TALKING ABOUT RECIPES
AND NOT FEELINGS.

29:20.250 --> 29:22.041
THAT DOESN'T MEAN
THAT I'M READY TO GRADUATE.

29:22.083 --> 29:23.458
YOU ARE.

29:23.500 --> 29:26.041
I... (scoffs) I'VE BEEN COMING
HERE FOR ALMOST SIX YEARS,

29:26.083 --> 29:28.834
AND I'M SUPPOSED TO JUST...
STOP?

29:28.875 --> 29:30.875
YEAH, BECAUSE YOU'RE READY
TO STOP.

29:30.917 --> 29:32.959
HOW DO YOU KNOW?
YOU HAVE TO TRUST ME.

29:33.041 --> 29:34.333
I DO TRUST YOU.

29:34.375 --> 29:36.625
THAT'S WHY I'M SAYING
I HAVE TO STAY HERE WITH YOU.

29:36.667 --> 29:38.041
OKAY, WHY DID YOU GET
THAT ACCEPTANCE LETTER

29:38.083 --> 29:39.250
FROM LE CORDON BLEU?

29:39.291 --> 29:41.333
WHAT?

29:41.375 --> 29:43.625
I APPLIED AND I GOT IN.

29:43.667 --> 29:45.959
RIGHT. YOU APPLIED.

29:46.000 --> 29:48.333
COOKING SCHOOL IS NOT SOMETHING
THAT JUST HAPPENED TO YOU.

29:48.375 --> 29:51.875
IT'S NOT AN ACCIDENT TAKING
PEOPLE AWAY IN YOUR LIFE.

29:51.917 --> 29:53.166
YOU CHOSE IT.

29:53.208 --> 29:55.166
YOU WANT TO GO.

29:55.208 --> 29:58.041
AND I'M AFRAID THAT YOU BEING
ABLE TO COME BACK HERE,

29:58.083 --> 29:59.959
EVEN THOUGH WE BOTH KNOW THAT
YOU DON'T NEED IT ANYMORE,

30:00.000 --> 30:02.000
IS HOLDING YOU BACK.

30:07.083 --> 30:08.417
(sighs)

30:11.000 --> 30:12.041
I'M SCARED.

30:12.083 --> 30:14.041
I KNOW YOU ARE.

30:14.083 --> 30:15.250
NEW THINGS ARE SCARY.

30:15.291 --> 30:18.125
ANYTHING WORTH HAVING
IS SCARY.

30:18.166 --> 30:19.917
WHAT IF I DON'T LIKE IT?

30:19.959 --> 30:21.709
WELL, YOU'LL ONLY KNOW
IF YOU TRY.

30:23.500 --> 30:26.792
SO I'M JUST SOME BIRD THAT
YOU'RE KICKING OUT OF THE NEST?

30:28.458 --> 30:31.375
YOU'RE LIKE SOME BIRD.

30:31.417 --> 30:34.041
AND, HOLLY,

30:34.083 --> 30:36.208
YOU'RE READY TO FLY.

30:41.083 --> 30:42.583
HEY, GUYS.

30:45.834 --> 30:47.041
WHAT'S WRONG?

30:47.083 --> 30:48.333
(pours coffee)

30:48.375 --> 30:49.917
UH, NOTHIN'.

30:49.959 --> 30:51.375
I'M GOOD.

30:51.417 --> 30:53.041
HEY, SHELDON, YOU GOT ANYTHING
IN YOUR SHRINK PLAYBOOK

30:53.083 --> 30:54.834
TO HELP ME CONVINCE ANGELA

30:54.875 --> 30:57.125
THAT DROPPING OUT OF COLLEGE
AND MOVING TO ROME

30:57.166 --> 31:00.625
WITH A GUY 30 YEARS OLDER
THAN SHE IS, IS A BAD IDEA?

31:00.667 --> 31:02.834
THERE REALLY AREN'T ANY TRICKS
TO CONVINCING SOMEONE

31:02.875 --> 31:05.041
THAT THEY'RE NOT IN LOVE.

31:05.083 --> 31:07.166
IT'S A REMARKABLE EMOTION,

31:07.208 --> 31:10.041
IMPERVIOUS TO LOGIC AND...

31:10.083 --> 31:12.125
TURNING THE MOST MEASURED PEOPLE
INTO RISK-TAKERS

31:12.166 --> 31:15.000
WILLING TO DO ANYTHING
TO MAINTAIN THE FEELING.

31:15.041 --> 31:16.375
I MEAN...

31:16.417 --> 31:19.125
IS THERE ANYTHING GREATER
THAN BEING IN LOVE?

31:19.166 --> 31:21.583
AND I'M NOT SAYING THAT YOU
SHOULD GIVE HER YOUR BLESSING.

31:21.625 --> 31:23.542
I'M--I'M JUST SAYING
THERE'S NOTHING YOU CAN DO

31:23.583 --> 31:26.750
TO STOP HER OR TO...

31:26.792 --> 31:29.875
TO--TO--TO--TO MAKE HER SEE...

31:32.625 --> 31:35.625
SHELDON?

31:35.667 --> 31:37.041
I'M... (grunts)

31:37.083 --> 31:38.417
I'M MADLY IN LOVE,

31:38.458 --> 31:41.250
AND, UH...

31:41.291 --> 31:43.083
I QUIT.

31:43.125 --> 31:44.333
I-I QUIT.

31:48.041 --> 31:50.041
DID HE JUST QUIT HIS JOB?

31:50.083 --> 31:51.792
HE'S RIGHT.
I'M GOING FOR IT.

31:51.834 --> 31:53.458
SORRY. SEE YOU LATER.

32:07.083 --> 32:09.959
I KNEW YOU'D BE HERE.

32:10.000 --> 32:12.041
I LOVE BEING OUTSIDE.

32:12.083 --> 32:14.834
IT'S SO BEAUTIFUL OUTSIDE.

32:14.875 --> 32:16.041
YOU KNOW, I COULD STAND HERE

32:16.083 --> 32:17.709
AND MAKE SMALL TALK ABOUT
THE GRASS AND THE TREES,

32:17.750 --> 32:20.750
BUT I WON'T BECAUSE
I'M TOO MAD AT YOU.

32:20.792 --> 32:23.291
I'M FURIOUS AT YOU.

32:23.333 --> 32:25.041
YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME
TO WALK AWAY,

32:25.083 --> 32:26.125
AND YOU DON'T GET TO TELL ME

32:26.166 --> 32:27.917
THAT THIS IS YOUR JOURNEY
AND NOT MINE.

32:27.959 --> 32:29.208
I'M ON THIS ROAD.

32:29.250 --> 32:32.333
I'VE BEEN ON THIS ROAD
FOR 56 YEARS, ALL BY MYSELF,

32:32.375 --> 32:34.625
AND THEN YOU SHOWED UP
ON MY ROAD.

32:34.667 --> 32:35.917
AND THAT DAY
AND EVERY DAY SINCE

32:35.959 --> 32:37.041
HAVE BEEN THE GREATEST DAYS
OF MY LIFE,

32:37.083 --> 32:39.500
SO I AM NOT LEAVING YOU.

32:39.542 --> 32:42.583
AND I'M--I'M HAPPY TO CHANGE
DIAPERS AND TO WIPE DROOL

32:42.625 --> 32:46.041
AND TO HOLD YOUR HAND, 'CAUSE
I WANT TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

32:46.083 --> 32:48.250
I'M HONORED
TO TAKE CARE OF YOU.

32:48.291 --> 32:52.792
YOUR LAST DAYS WILL BE PRECIOUS,
AND I'LL CHERISH THEM.

32:52.834 --> 32:54.875
AND IF YOU'RE TOO FAR GONE
TO REMEMBER MY NAME,

32:54.917 --> 32:56.959
THEN I'LL REMIND YOU.
BUT YOU DESERVE TO BE LOVED,

32:57.000 --> 32:59.333
RIGHT UP UNTIL
YOUR VERY LAST MOMENT.

32:59.375 --> 33:01.834
YOU DESERVE TO BE
SURROUNDED BY LOVE.

33:01.875 --> 33:04.041
YOU DESERVE YOU HAVE THE FACE
OF THE MAN WHO LOVES YOU

33:04.083 --> 33:05.542
BE THE LAST THING
THAT YOU SEE.

33:05.583 --> 33:08.041
AND I DESERVE THE CHANCE TO
LOVE YOU FOR AS LONG AS I CAN

33:08.083 --> 33:11.041
OR AS HARD AS I CAN.
SO I AM NOT WALKING AWAY.

33:11.083 --> 33:14.000
SHELDON--
NO, I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.
I'M ON THIS ROAD.

33:14.041 --> 33:16.041
WE ARE ON THIS ROAD TOGETHER.

33:16.083 --> 33:18.333
I'M NOT WALKING AWAY.
OKAY.

33:18.375 --> 33:20.125
WHAT?
OKAY.

33:20.166 --> 33:22.083
YOU'RE RIGHT. I'M WRONG.

33:22.125 --> 33:24.000
OH.

33:25.959 --> 33:27.625
(sighs)

33:32.333 --> 33:36.834
SO WHAT ARE WE GONNA DO

33:38.083 --> 33:41.041
