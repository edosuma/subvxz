WEBVTT

00:01.791 --> 00:03.993
>> John: WELCOME, WELCOME,

00:04.060 --> 00:06.362
WELCOME TO "LAST WEEK TONIGHT!"

00:06.429 --> 00:07.563
I'M JOHN OLIVER.

00:07.630 --> 00:08.898
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR JOINING

00:08.965 --> 00:10.533
US.

00:10.600 --> 00:12.635
WE ARE BACK AND THERE IS SIMPLY

00:12.702 --> 00:14.170
NO TIME TO RECAP EVERYTHING

00:14.237 --> 00:15.037
THAT'S HAPPENED SINCE WE'VE BEEN

00:15.104 --> 00:16.239
AWAY.

00:16.305 --> 00:17.640
BUT IN SHORT, WE NEARLY WENT TO

00:17.707 --> 00:19.008
WAR WITH IRAN, THE UK'S ELECTION

00:19.075 --> 00:21.277
MADE BOJO PRIME MINISTER, AND

00:21.344 --> 00:23.112
THE CORONAVIRUS HAS STARTED

00:23.179 --> 00:23.813
SPREADING AROUND THE WORLD ‐‐

00:23.880 --> 00:24.947
AND IF YOU HAPPEN TO FEEL LIKE

00:25.014 --> 00:31.120
YOU'RE GETTING SICK, YOU DO HAVE

00:31.187 --> 00:32.122
IT, AND YOU ONLY HAVE HOURS TO

00:32.123 --> 00:32.521
LIVE.

00:32.522 --> 00:33.155
ALSO, HARRY AND MEGHAN LEFT THE

00:33.222 --> 00:33.956
ROYAL FAMILY, BABY YODA SHOWED

00:34.023 --> 00:35.191
THE WORLD WHAT IT WAS LIKE WHEN

00:35.258 --> 00:35.791
YODA WAS A BABY, BONG JOON‐HO

00:35.858 --> 00:36.425
WON ALL THE OSCARS,

00:36.492 --> 00:37.393
BERNIE SANDERS WON

00:37.460 --> 00:38.761
NEW HAMPSHIRE, AND THIS POODLE

00:38.828 --> 00:39.595
NAMED SIBA WON BEST IN SHOW AT

00:39.662 --> 00:41.397
THE WESTMINSTER DOG SHOW, MAKING

00:41.464 --> 00:44.333
HER, I BELIEVE, 100% THAT BITCH.

00:44.400 --> 00:46.869
BUT OBVIOUSLY WE HAVE TO GET TO

00:46.936 --> 00:49.472
THE BIGGEST STORY OF THE BREAK:

00:49.539 --> 00:51.674
WHAT HAPPENS WHEN AN OBVIOUS

00:51.741 --> 00:54.210
CRIMINAL SOCIOPATH IS ACCUSED OF

00:54.277 --> 00:56.112
ABUSING HIS POWER YET SOMEHOW

00:56.178 --> 00:58.915
HOLDS ONTO HIS OFFICE BY SAILING

00:58.981 --> 00:59.515
THROUGH A SHAM INVESTIGATION.

00:59.582 --> 01:00.016
>> GRITTY, THE

01:00.082 --> 01:01.284
PHILADELPHIA FLYERS MASCOT, IS

01:01.350 --> 01:03.920
NOW CLEARED OF WRONGDOING.

01:03.986 --> 01:05.955
A MAN CLAIMED THAT GRITTY

01:06.022 --> 01:08.291
PUNCHED HIS 13 YEAR‐OLD SON IN

01:08.357 --> 01:09.025
THE BACK DURING A HOLIDAY

01:09.091 --> 01:11.494
PHOTO SHOOT IN NOVEMBER.

01:11.561 --> 01:12.361
AFTER AN INVESTIGATION,

01:12.428 --> 01:13.429
PHILADELPHIA POLICE CLEARED

01:13.496 --> 01:15.398
GRITTY.

01:15.464 --> 01:17.233
I'M SURE THAT GRITTY JUST KIND

01:17.300 --> 01:18.134
OF ROLLED HIS EYES BECAUSE

01:18.200 --> 01:19.569
THAT'S WHAT THEY ‐‐ THEY'RE

01:19.635 --> 01:20.937
GOOGLY.

01:21.003 --> 01:22.104
>> John: WAIT, HOLD ON THERE.

01:22.171 --> 01:23.172
FOR A START, I'M NOT SURE THAT

01:23.239 --> 01:24.340
"GOOGLY" IS THE BEST WAY TO

01:24.407 --> 01:25.942
DESCRIBE GRITTY'S EYES AT ALL.

01:26.008 --> 01:27.643
"DEEPLY PSYCHOTIC"?

01:27.710 --> 01:28.778
SURE.

01:28.844 --> 01:29.779
"TWO SWIRLING VORTEXES OF

01:29.845 --> 01:30.546
HORNINESS AND RAGE"?

01:30.613 --> 01:31.681
BETTER.

01:31.747 --> 01:33.049
"A PAIR OF HAUNTED NIPPLES

01:33.115 --> 01:35.418
FLOATING ON A PLATE OF MILK AND

01:35.484 --> 01:35.918
SURROUNDED BY A NEST OF

01:35.985 --> 01:36.752
ORANGUTAN PUBES"?

01:36.819 --> 01:38.921
NOW WE'RE GETTING SOMEWHERE.

01:38.988 --> 01:39.455
NOW WE'RE DESCRIBING THIS

01:39.522 --> 01:43.926
MONSTER'S EYES.

01:43.993 --> 01:44.894
BUT CLEARLY GRITTY ISN'T THE

01:44.961 --> 01:45.728
ONLY AGGRO NEON WEIRDO

01:45.795 --> 01:46.729
CELEBRATING ACQUITTAL THESE

01:46.796 --> 01:47.730
DAYS.

01:47.797 --> 01:49.498
THE PRESIDENT BEAT HIS

01:49.565 --> 01:51.033
IMPEACHMENT CHARGES, ALTHOUGH

01:51.100 --> 01:52.702
CERTAIN REPUBLICANS WHO VOTED TO

01:52.768 --> 01:53.269
ACQUIT HIM CLAIMED THAT THE

01:53.336 --> 01:57.673
WHOLE EXPERIENCE MAY HAVE

01:57.740 --> 01:58.541
CHANGED HIM.

01:58.608 --> 01:59.308
>> I BELIEVE THAT THE PRESIDENT

01:59.375 --> 02:00.176
HAS LEARNED FROM THIS CASE.

02:00.242 --> 02:02.945
THE PRESIDENT HAS BEEN

02:03.012 --> 02:05.348
IMPEACHED.

02:05.414 --> 02:06.349
THAT'S A PRETTY BIG LESSON.

02:06.415 --> 02:07.383
I BELIEVE THAT HE WILL BE MUCH

02:07.450 --> 02:10.620
MORE CAUTIOUS IN THE FUTURE.

02:10.686 --> 02:12.688
>> John: WHAT ARE YOU TALKING

02:12.755 --> 02:13.923
ABOUT, SUSAN?

02:13.990 --> 02:15.291
OF COURSE HE HASN'T LEARNED HIS

02:15.358 --> 02:16.392
LESSON.

02:16.459 --> 02:18.160
TRUMP NEVER LEARNS HIS LESSON.

02:18.227 --> 02:20.129
THIS IS A MAN WHOSE FIRST‐BORN

02:20.196 --> 02:21.163
CHILD WAS DONALD TRUMP JR., AND

02:21.230 --> 02:23.299
HE KEPT HAVING CHILDREN.

02:23.366 --> 02:24.900
THERE'S NO LESSON‐LEARNING

02:24.967 --> 02:26.502
CAPACITY IN THE MAN.

02:26.569 --> 02:27.803
AND IF YOU NEED FURTHER PROOF OF

02:27.870 --> 02:29.105
THAT, JUST LOOK WHAT HAPPENED

02:29.171 --> 02:31.907
THIS WEEK WITH TRUMP ASSOCIATE

02:31.974 --> 02:32.541
ROGER STONE, CONVICTED LAST YEAR

02:32.608 --> 02:33.275
ON SEVEN COUNTS OF LYING TO

02:33.342 --> 02:34.710
CONGRESS, WITNESS TAMPERING, AND

02:34.777 --> 02:36.679
OBSTRUCTING A PROCEEDING.

02:36.746 --> 02:38.481
ON MONDAY, PROSECUTORS

02:38.547 --> 02:39.682
RECOMMENDED A SENTENCE OF SEVEN

02:39.749 --> 02:41.050
TO NINE YEARS IN PRISON.

02:41.117 --> 02:42.018
AND THAT IS WHEN THINGS GOT

02:42.084 --> 02:43.753
WEIRD.

02:43.819 --> 02:45.421
>> TONIGHT, AT LEAST FOUR

02:45.488 --> 02:46.922
PROSECUTORS STEPPING DOWN FROM

02:46.989 --> 02:49.025
THE ROGER STONE CASE AFTER A

02:49.091 --> 02:50.226
DRAMATIC DECISION TO OVERRULE

02:50.292 --> 02:52.061
THEIR RECOMMENDATION THAT HE

02:52.128 --> 02:53.496
SPEND SEVEN TO NINE YEARS IN

02:53.562 --> 02:55.331
PRISON.

02:55.398 --> 02:57.233
THE STUNNING REBUKE FROM THE

02:57.299 --> 02:58.567
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT LEADERSHIP

02:58.634 --> 02:59.902
CAME JUST HOURS AFTER

02:59.969 --> 03:02.171
PRESIDENT TRUMP TWEETED THAT THE

03:02.238 --> 03:02.805
PROSECUTORS' SUGGESTED SENTENCE

03:02.872 --> 03:03.439
FOR STONE WAS "HORRIBLE AND VERY

03:03.506 --> 03:04.240
UNFAIR.

03:04.306 --> 03:07.276
A MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE."

03:07.343 --> 03:08.744
>> John: YEAH, BUT WAS IT A

03:08.811 --> 03:09.979
MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE THOUGH?

03:10.046 --> 03:11.681
'CAUSE BEAR IN MIND, STONE WAS

03:11.747 --> 03:14.150
FOUND GUILTY ON ALL COUNTS, THE

03:14.216 --> 03:15.251
RECOMMENDATION WAS WITHIN

03:15.317 --> 03:16.686
ESTABLISHED FEDERAL GUIDELINES,

03:16.752 --> 03:18.921
AND ALSO, JUST LOOK AT HIM.

03:18.988 --> 03:20.690
I KNOW YOU SHOULDN'T PROFILE

03:20.756 --> 03:21.457
PEOPLE BASED ON HOW THEY LOOK,

03:21.524 --> 03:23.125
BUT ON THE OTHER HAND...

03:23.192 --> 03:24.393
LOOK!

03:24.460 --> 03:25.161
AT!

03:25.227 --> 03:26.629
HIM!

03:26.696 --> 03:28.364
LOOK AT HIM!

03:28.431 --> 03:29.732
HIS DRESS CODE IS BUSINESS

03:29.799 --> 03:32.702
SCOUNDREL.

03:32.768 --> 03:33.602
HE LOOKS LIKE THE MANNEQUIN AT A

03:33.669 --> 03:34.437
DEPARTMENT STORE FOR DICK TRACY

03:34.503 --> 03:35.771
VILLAINS.

03:35.838 --> 03:36.872
HE LOOKS LIKE A GUY WHOSE

03:36.939 --> 03:37.807
DAY PLANNER JUST SAYS

03:37.873 --> 03:39.842
"FRAME ROGER RABBIT."

03:39.909 --> 03:41.377
LOOK AT HIM!

03:41.444 --> 03:43.746
AND EVEN IF YOU THINK THE

03:43.813 --> 03:44.413
RECOMMENDED SENTENCE WAS, IN

03:44.480 --> 03:45.414
FACT, TOO LONG, IT'S UP TO THE

03:45.481 --> 03:47.116
JUDGE WHETHER TO IMPOSE IT, AND

03:47.183 --> 03:48.884
THERE'S AN APPEALS SYSTEM AFTER

03:48.951 --> 03:51.220
THAT.

03:51.287 --> 03:55.491
BUT TO HAVE DOJ LEADERSHIP

03:55.558 --> 03:56.425
INTERFERING IN A CASE INVOLVING

03:56.492 --> 03:57.259
A TRUMP ALLY HOURS AFTER THE

03:57.326 --> 03:58.160
PRESIDENT DIRECTLY COMMENTED ON

03:58.227 --> 03:58.728
IT IS APPALLING.

03:58.794 --> 04:01.030
THIS IS AMERICA.

04:01.097 --> 04:02.331
YOUR EXPERIENCE WITH THE

04:02.398 --> 04:03.833
CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM

04:03.899 --> 04:05.034
SHOULDN'T DEPEND ON HOW MUCH THE

04:05.101 --> 04:06.535
PRESIDENT LIKES YOU, IT SHOULD

04:06.602 --> 04:07.103
DEPEND ON HOW MUCH MONEY YOU

04:07.169 --> 04:08.170
HAVE, WHAT COLOR YOUR SKIN IS,

04:08.237 --> 04:09.638
AND WHETHER OR NOT THE JUDGE HAS

04:09.705 --> 04:11.207
ALREADY HAD LUNCH.

04:11.273 --> 04:13.209
THAT IS HOW WE DO THINGS HERE IN

04:13.275 --> 04:17.713
THE UNITED STATES, BUDDY.

04:17.780 --> 04:20.116
AND THE EXCUSES OFFERED BY THE

04:20.182 --> 04:20.983
PRESIDENT'S DEFENDERS RANGED

04:21.050 --> 04:22.284
FROM THE ABSURD TO THE GENUINELY

04:22.351 --> 04:24.320
TERRIFYING.

04:24.386 --> 04:25.254
>> THE EXECUTIVE POWER IS VESTED

04:25.321 --> 04:26.622
IN THE PRESIDENT.

04:26.689 --> 04:27.289
THE TOP LAW ENFORCEMENT OFFICER

04:27.356 --> 04:28.491
IS THE ATTORNEY GENERAL.

04:28.557 --> 04:29.859
IF HE WANTS TO COUNTERACT

04:29.925 --> 04:31.160
DECISIONS OF THE LINE

04:31.227 --> 04:32.928
PROSECUTOR, THAT'S HIS DANG JOB.

04:32.995 --> 04:33.929
I MEAN, THERE'S NOTHING WRONG

04:33.996 --> 04:36.932
WITH IT.

04:36.999 --> 04:38.100
>> I LIKE THE FACT THAT A

04:38.167 --> 04:38.934
PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES,

04:39.001 --> 04:40.703
WHEN HE SEES INJUSTICE, HE'S

04:40.737 --> 04:41.103
POINTING IT OUT.

04:41.137 --> 04:41.704
THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT YOU WANT TO

04:41.771 --> 04:43.239
HAVE A PRESIDENT DO.

04:43.305 --> 04:45.374
>>I DON'T WANT TO HEAR ANY CRAP

04:45.441 --> 04:46.809
ABOUT AN INDEPENDENT JUSTICE

04:46.876 --> 04:49.211
DEPARTMENT.

04:49.278 --> 04:49.979
THIS JUSTICE DEPARTMENT ‐‐ AS

04:50.045 --> 04:50.813
DOES EVERY ONE ‐‐ WORKS FOR THE

04:50.880 --> 04:51.814
PRESIDENT.

04:51.881 --> 04:52.381
IT IS PART OF THE EXECUTIVE

04:52.448 --> 04:53.749
BRANCH.

04:53.816 --> 04:55.851
>> John: OH, HE'S RIGHT, OF

04:55.918 --> 04:57.086
COURSE.

04:57.153 --> 04:58.287
EVERYONE AT THE JUSTICE

04:58.354 --> 04:58.988
DEPARTMENT WORKS FOR THE

04:59.054 --> 04:59.755
PRESIDENT.

04:59.822 --> 05:00.523
WHEN HE SAYS "JUMP," THEY

05:00.589 --> 05:01.423
SHOULD SAY "HOW HIGH?"

05:01.490 --> 05:02.258
WHEN HE SAYS "LOCK HER UP," THEY

05:02.324 --> 05:03.459
SHOULD SAY "HOW LONG?"

05:03.526 --> 05:05.828
WHEN HE SAYS "GET ME FLUBBER,"

05:05.895 --> 05:07.363
THEY SHOULD SAY "FROM THE

05:07.364 --> 05:07.729
MOVIE?"

05:07.730 --> 05:08.898
WHEN HE SAYS "YES," THEY SHOULD

05:08.964 --> 05:10.699
SAY "OKAY."

05:10.766 --> 05:12.902
WHEN HE SAYS "WHERE'S THAT

05:12.968 --> 05:15.037
FLUBBER I ASKED FOR?"

05:15.104 --> 05:16.071
THEY SHOULD SAY "WE'RE WORKING

05:16.138 --> 05:16.705
ON IT."

05:16.772 --> 05:17.606
WHEN HE SAYS "I NEED IT NOW,"

05:17.673 --> 05:18.841
THEY SHOULD SAY "OKAY, HERE IT

05:18.908 --> 05:19.308
IS."

05:19.375 --> 05:20.476
WHEN HE SAYS "IS THIS LETTUCE?"

05:20.543 --> 05:21.177
THEY SHOULD SAY "NO, THAT'S

05:21.243 --> 05:22.411
FLUBBER."

05:22.478 --> 05:23.579
WHEN HE SAYS "IT'S NOT

05:23.646 --> 05:25.080
DANCING," THEY SHOULD SAY "IT'S

05:25.147 --> 05:25.848
PROBABLY JUST TIRED."

05:25.915 --> 05:26.849
WHEN HE SAYS "GO AWAY SO MY

05:26.916 --> 05:28.450
FLUBBER CAN SLEEP," THEY SHOULD

05:28.517 --> 05:30.519
SAY "IT WOULD BE AN HONOR."

05:30.586 --> 05:32.788
AND THEN EVERYONE IN THE JUSTICE

05:32.855 --> 05:33.889
DEPARTMENT SHOULD LINE UP AND

05:33.956 --> 05:34.990
KISS THE PRESIDENT'S FLUBBER

05:35.057 --> 05:36.158
GOOD NIGHT BECAUSE, DAMN IT,

05:36.225 --> 05:37.293
THEY ARE PART OF THE EXECUTIVE

05:37.359 --> 05:38.727
BRANCH.

05:38.794 --> 05:41.764
THEY WORK FOR HIM.

05:41.831 --> 05:43.532
THIS WHOLE SITUATION LOOKED SO

05:43.599 --> 05:44.900
BAD THAT BARR GAVE AN INTERVIEW

05:44.967 --> 05:46.268
IN WHICH HE CLAIMED HE NEVER

05:46.335 --> 05:47.436
DISCUSSED STONE'S SENTENCE WITH

05:47.503 --> 05:49.071
TRUMP, BUT ADDED THAT IT WAS

05:49.138 --> 05:50.306
TIME FOR THE PRESIDENT TO STOP

05:50.372 --> 05:51.307
TWEETING ABOUT DEPARTMENT OF

05:51.373 --> 05:53.142
JUSTICE CRIMINAL CASES.

05:53.209 --> 05:55.611
YOU KNOW, GOOD LUCK WITH THAT.

05:55.678 --> 05:56.745
AND WHILE THIS WAS WIDELY

05:56.812 --> 05:57.980
PORTRAYED BY THE MEDIA AS A RIFT

05:58.047 --> 06:00.015
BETWEEN TRUMP AND HIS AG, I HAVE

06:00.082 --> 06:01.350
A SICKENING FEELING THAT

06:01.417 --> 06:02.618
LAURA INGRAHAM WAS ONE OF THE

06:02.685 --> 06:04.420
FEW PEOPLE ACTUALLY SEEING

06:04.486 --> 06:06.255
THINGS CLEARLY.

06:06.322 --> 06:06.956
>> ALL RIGHT, JOHN, THE MEDIA

06:07.022 --> 06:08.524
SEES THIS SEXY STORY OF TRUMP

06:08.591 --> 06:09.925
VERSUS BARR, BUT THEY MISSED THE

06:09.992 --> 06:10.960
FACT THAT BARR WAS BASICALLY

06:11.026 --> 06:13.128
TELLING TRUMP, "DON'T WORRY, I

06:13.195 --> 06:15.197
GOT THIS."

06:15.264 --> 06:16.532
>> John: TO BORROW A PHRASE USED

06:16.599 --> 06:17.533
ALMOST EXCLUSIVELY BY WHITE

06:17.600 --> 06:20.069
SUPREMACISTS: LAURA INGRAHAM IS

06:20.135 --> 06:21.503
RIGHT.

06:21.570 --> 06:23.973
BARR'S COMMENTS WEREN'T SO MUCH

06:24.039 --> 06:25.608
"DON'T INTERFERE WITH THE

06:25.674 --> 06:26.976
JUSTICE DEPARTMENT" AS THEY WERE

06:27.042 --> 06:28.644
"DON'T 'PUBLICLY' INTERFERE WITH

06:28.711 --> 06:30.045
THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT, BECAUSE

06:30.112 --> 06:31.146
I'M ALREADY DOING WHAT YOU

06:31.213 --> 06:32.448
WANT."

06:32.514 --> 06:33.582
IN FACT, ON FRIDAY, NEWS BROKE

06:33.649 --> 06:34.917
THAT BARR WAS REVIEWING THE

06:34.984 --> 06:36.952
DOJ'S PROSECUTION OF ANOTHER

06:37.019 --> 06:38.420
TRUMP ALLY, MICHAEL FLYNN, ALL

06:38.487 --> 06:40.756
OF WHICH SUGGESTS SUSAN COLLINS

06:40.823 --> 06:42.391
MAY ACTUALLY BE RIGHT ABOUT ONE

06:42.458 --> 06:44.159
THING: TRUMP DID LEARN A LESSON

06:44.226 --> 06:46.428
FROM HIS IMPEACHMENT TRIAL.

06:46.495 --> 06:47.997
SPECIFICALLY, "I CAN GET AWAY

06:48.063 --> 06:49.565
WITH ANYTHING, BECAUSE NO ONE

06:49.632 --> 06:51.367
WILL HOLD ME ACCOUNTABLE."

06:51.433 --> 06:53.302
AND UNLIKE THE CHILD WHO WAS

06:53.369 --> 06:54.470
DEFINITELY PUNCHED IN THE BACK

06:54.536 --> 06:56.872
BY A GOOGLY‐EYED FUR DEMON, WE

06:56.939 --> 06:58.340
CAN'T SAY WE DIDN'T SEE THIS

06:58.407 --> 06:59.575
COMING.

06:59.642 --> 07:01.477
AND NOW THIS:

07:01.543 --> 07:02.912
>> Announcer: AND NOW, ANOTHER

07:02.978 --> 07:05.547
INSTALLMENT OF "COMING UP ON

07:05.614 --> 07:07.549
'THE DOCTORS.'"

07:07.616 --> 07:08.751
>> THE SENIORS THAT ARE TAKING

07:08.817 --> 07:10.219
"FIFTY SHADES OF GREY" TO A

07:10.286 --> 07:11.620
WHOLE NEW LEVEL.

07:11.687 --> 07:12.621
PLUS...

07:12.688 --> 07:15.124
>> YOU CALLED 911 FOR THAT?

07:15.190 --> 07:15.824
>> I WANT MY [BLEEP] WEED BACK.

07:15.891 --> 07:16.859
>> THEN...

07:16.926 --> 07:19.695
>> IS IT POSSIBLE TO OVERDOSE ON

07:19.762 --> 07:24.333
>> THEN...

07:24.400 --> 07:27.903
>> BURGLAR DIDN'T DEMAND CASH,

07:27.970 --> 07:28.771
JUST WANTED TO SUCK HIS TOES.

07:28.837 --> 07:30.806
>> PLUS...

07:30.873 --> 07:32.942

07:33.008 --> 07:33.442
POO.

07:49.758 --> 07:50.459
SEVERE BUTT CHEEK PAIN.

>> THEN...

07:51.427 --> 07:54.430
>> WANT TO MAKE SOME CASH?

07:54.496 --> 07:55.097
MAYBE YOU SHOULD SELL YOUR POOP.

07:55.798 --> 07:56.632
>> WHY ARE PEOPLE ARE PUTTING

07:56.699 --> 07:57.700
ANTIANXIETY PILLS DOWN THERE.

>> THEN...

07:59.101 --> 08:00.202
>> TIME FOR ANOTHER INSTALLMENT

08:00.269 --> 08:04.173
OF "DON'T PUT THAT DOWN THERE."

08:04.239 --> 08:05.174
>> THAT'S TODAY.

08:05.240 --> 08:06.475
>> John: MOVING ON.

08:06.542 --> 08:07.676
FOR OUR MAIN STORY TONIGHT, WE

08:07.743 --> 08:09.278
THOUGHT WE'D TALK ABOUT AN ISSUE

08:09.345 --> 08:10.145
THAT'S DOMINATED THE DEMOCRATIC

08:10.212 --> 08:10.879
PRIMARY.

08:10.946 --> 08:11.847
AND I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT WHY

08:11.914 --> 08:13.115
TOM STEYER DOESN'T LOOK

08:13.182 --> 08:13.916
RICHER ‐‐ BUT WHY DOESN'T HE

08:13.983 --> 08:15.017
THOUGH?

08:15.084 --> 08:15.918
HIS SKIN'S SALLOW, HIS CLOTHES

08:15.985 --> 08:17.252
DON'T FIT RIGHT, AND HE SEEMS TO

08:17.319 --> 08:20.222
HAVE ONLY ONE TIE.

08:20.289 --> 08:21.256
WHAT IS THIS MAN DOING WITH ALL

08:21.323 --> 08:25.894
HIS FUCKING MONEY?

08:25.961 --> 08:26.462
NO, WE'RE NOT TALKING ABOUT

08:26.528 --> 08:26.929
THAT.

08:26.996 --> 08:28.097
INSTEAD, WE'RE GOING TO TALK

08:28.130 --> 08:28.463
ABOUT THIS:

08:28.497 --> 08:29.298
>> IT'S THE HOT BUZZ PHRASE FOR

08:29.365 --> 08:30.566
DEMOCRATS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT,

08:30.632 --> 08:31.000
"MEDICARE FOR ALL."

08:31.066 --> 08:32.267
>> WE WILL HAVE MEDICARE FOR

08:32.334 --> 08:33.202
ALL.

08:33.268 --> 08:35.004
>> WE HAVE A CHANCE FOR MEDICARE

08:35.070 --> 08:35.704
FOR ALL.

08:35.771 --> 08:37.039
>> MEDICARE FOR ALL.

08:37.106 --> 08:38.073
>> MEDICARE FOR ALL.

08:38.140 --> 08:39.008
>> NOW THERE IS A LOT OF TALK

08:39.074 --> 08:41.410
ABOUT MEDICARE FOR ALL.

08:41.477 --> 08:44.346
WHAT DOES THAT MEAN?

08:44.413 --> 08:45.314
>> John: GREAT QUESTION FROM A

08:45.381 --> 08:46.448
GREAT JUDGE AND AN EVEN GREATER

08:46.515 --> 08:48.484
HUMAN BEING.

08:48.550 --> 08:51.153
AND TO ANSWER THE QUESTION FROM

08:51.220 --> 08:51.787
RUTH BADER GINSBURG'S INEVITABLE

08:51.854 --> 08:52.421
SUCCESSOR: WHAT IS MEDICARE FOR

08:52.488 --> 08:54.323
ALL?

08:54.390 --> 08:56.425
WELL, RIGHT NOW, WE HAVE WHAT'S

08:56.492 --> 08:57.926
CALLED A MULTI‐PAYER SYSTEM.

08:57.993 --> 08:59.561
WHAT THAT MEANS IS, MAYBE YOUR

08:59.628 --> 09:01.096
HEALTH CARE IS COVERED BY

09:01.163 --> 09:02.531
PRIVATE INSURANCE PURCHASED BY

09:02.598 --> 09:03.232
YOU OR YOUR EMPLOYER.

09:03.298 --> 09:04.633
OR MAYBE IT'S COVERED BY A

09:04.700 --> 09:06.602
GOVERNMENT PROGRAM, LIKE

09:06.668 --> 09:08.537
MEDICARE OR MEDICAID.

09:08.604 --> 09:09.071
OR MAYBE YOU'RE ONE OF THE

09:09.138 --> 09:09.638
27 MILLION AMERICANS WITH NO

09:09.705 --> 09:11.440
INSURANCE, IN WHICH CASE, YOU'RE

09:11.507 --> 09:13.175
FUCKED.

09:13.242 --> 09:14.376
THE BASIC IDEA BEHIND MEDICARE

09:14.443 --> 09:15.744
FOR ALL IS THAT ALL OF THIS

09:15.811 --> 09:17.646
WOULD BE REPLACED BY A

09:17.713 --> 09:18.914
GOVERNMENT‐FUNDED, SINGLE‐PAYER

09:18.981 --> 09:21.016
PROGRAM, AND THE GOAL OF

09:21.083 --> 09:22.184
UNIVERSAL HEALTH‐CARE COVERAGE

09:22.251 --> 09:23.819
IS EXTREMELY APPEALING.

09:23.886 --> 09:25.387
BOTH BERNIE SANDERS AND

09:25.454 --> 09:26.889
ELIZABETH WARREN HAVE PUT OUT

09:26.955 --> 09:27.489
VERSIONS OF MEDICARE FOR ALL.

09:27.556 --> 09:29.058
BUT OTHER DEMOCRATS HAVE BEEN

09:29.124 --> 09:29.958
MUCH WARIER OF IT, AND

09:30.025 --> 09:31.360
CONSERVATIVES ABSOLUTELY HATE

09:31.427 --> 09:33.262
THE IDEA.

09:33.328 --> 09:34.830
>> WE CANNOT AFFORD MEDICARE FOR

09:34.897 --> 09:35.798
ALL.

09:35.864 --> 09:36.899
THIS IS THE END OF AMERICA AS WE

09:36.965 --> 09:38.901
KNOW IT ECONOMICALLY.

09:38.967 --> 09:40.202
>> I THINK LITERALLY 90% OF

09:40.269 --> 09:41.103
HOSPITALS WOULD GO UNDER

09:41.170 --> 09:42.204
TOMORROW.

09:42.271 --> 09:43.038
>> RIGHT.

09:43.105 --> 09:44.106
MEDICARE FOR ALL.

09:44.173 --> 09:45.374
I LIVED IN ENGLAND, SEAN.

09:45.441 --> 09:46.809
NATIONALIZED HEALTH CARE IS A

09:46.875 --> 09:48.877
DISASTER.

09:48.944 --> 09:50.479
WHEN RICH, FAMOUS PEOPLE GET

09:50.546 --> 09:51.880
SICK, THEY DON'T FLY TO CANADA.

09:51.947 --> 09:54.216
THEY DON'T FLY TO CUBA.

09:54.283 --> 09:55.050
THEY COME HERE, BECAUSE WE HAVE

09:55.117 --> 09:57.219
THE BEST MEDICINE IN THE WORLD.

09:57.286 --> 09:58.787
>> John: LOOK, LOOK, I WILL GIVE

09:58.854 --> 10:00.289
THAT MAN THIS: AMERICA DOES HAVE

10:00.355 --> 10:01.423
ONE OF THE BEST HEALTHCARE

10:01.490 --> 10:03.225
SYSTEMS IN THE WORLD FOR RICH,

10:03.292 --> 10:05.094
FAMOUS PEOPLE.

10:05.160 --> 10:06.895
UNFORTUNATELY, TOO MANY PEOPLE

10:06.962 --> 10:07.996
ARE BORN IN THIS COUNTRY WITH A

10:08.063 --> 10:09.231
TERRIBLE PRE‐EXISTING CONDITION

10:09.298 --> 10:11.767
CALLED "NOT BEING BEYONCE."

10:11.834 --> 10:13.602
SOME OF US ‐‐ MANY OF US, IN

10:13.669 --> 10:17.406
FACT ‐‐ ARE SOLANGE.

10:17.473 --> 10:19.441
AND FOR SO MANY AMERICANS, OUR

10:19.508 --> 10:21.143
SYSTEM IS BADLY BROKEN, AND I'M

10:21.210 --> 10:22.978
NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT THE

10:23.045 --> 10:24.213
27 MILLION WITHOUT HEALTH

10:24.279 --> 10:26.148
INSURANCE, BUT THE NEARLY

10:26.215 --> 10:28.750
44 MILLION MORE WHO ARE

10:28.817 --> 10:29.818
UNDERINSURED: PEOPLE WITH HIGH

10:29.885 --> 10:31.186
DEDUCTIBLES AND COPAYS THAT CAN

10:31.253 --> 10:33.622
END UP BLEEDING THEM DRY.

10:33.689 --> 10:35.324
THE MAJORITY OF PEOPLE WHO FILE

10:35.390 --> 10:36.291
FOR BANKRUPTCY CITE MEDICAL

10:36.358 --> 10:38.193
EXPENSES AS A FACTOR, AND YOU

10:38.260 --> 10:39.595
PROBABLY ALREADY KNEW THAT DEEP

10:39.661 --> 10:41.263
DOWN FROM JUST HOW OFTEN YOU SEE

10:41.330 --> 10:42.764
GOFUNDME CAMPAIGNS ONLINE FROM

10:42.831 --> 10:44.133
WORRIED PARENTS OF SICK

10:44.199 --> 10:45.501
CHILDREN OR YOUR FRIEND WHO GOT

10:45.567 --> 10:47.469
A PINEAPPLE STUCK UP HIS ASS AND

10:47.536 --> 10:50.939
NEEDS HELP PAYING THE DOCTORS TO

10:51.006 --> 10:51.974
STOP LAUGHING AND GET IT OUT.

10:52.040 --> 10:55.043
AND INCIDENTALLY, FOR ALL THE

10:55.110 --> 10:55.677
HEARTWARMING SUCCESS STORIES YOU

10:55.744 --> 10:57.012
SEE, A STUDY FOUND 90% PERCENT

10:57.079 --> 11:00.182
OF CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGNS FOR

11:00.249 --> 11:00.782
MEDICAL EXPENSES FAIL TO MEET

11:00.849 --> 11:01.683
THEIR GOAL ‐‐ AND WHEN THEY FALL

11:01.750 --> 11:04.620
SHORT, IT CAN BE CRUSHING.

11:04.686 --> 11:05.888
WATCH AS ONE FAMILY STRUGGLES TO

11:05.954 --> 11:07.122
RAISE $10,000 FOR EXPENSES

11:07.189 --> 11:08.891
ARISING FROM THEIR TWO‐YEAR‐OLD

11:08.957 --> 11:10.292
DAUGHTER'S EYE DISORDER.

11:10.359 --> 11:11.793
>> SHEILA'S FUNDRAISER ISN'T

11:11.860 --> 11:14.363
GOING AS WELL AS THEY'D HOPED.

11:14.429 --> 11:14.997
ABOUT A MONTH IN, IT'S ONLY

11:15.063 --> 11:18.867
RAISED $610.

11:18.934 --> 11:19.935
EARLY MORNING ON THE DAY OF

11:20.002 --> 11:21.003
SHEILA'S SURGERY, HER PARENTS

11:21.069 --> 11:22.237
ARE STILL TRYING TO GET THE WORD

11:22.304 --> 11:23.672
OUT.

11:23.739 --> 11:26.408
>> OKAY, SO WE'RE GONNA MAKE HER

11:26.475 --> 11:28.510
SIGN, #EyesForSheila.

11:28.577 --> 11:31.313
VERY GOOD.

11:31.380 --> 11:32.881
>> John: THINK ABOUT WHAT YOU'RE

11:32.948 --> 11:34.082
LOOKING AT THERE.

11:34.149 --> 11:36.451
IT'S A PRETTY DYSTOPIAN

11:36.518 --> 11:37.386
SOCIETY WE'RE LIVING IN IF YOUR

11:37.452 --> 11:38.353
PHYSICAL AND FINANCIAL WELLBEING

11:38.420 --> 11:39.388
DEPEND ON WHETHER YOUR

11:39.454 --> 11:41.089
CROWDFUNDING CAMPAIGN CAN GET A

11:41.156 --> 11:41.990
SIGNAL BOOST FROM JIFFPOM THE

11:42.057 --> 11:43.458
POMERANIAN.

11:43.525 --> 11:44.960
AND GOOD LUCK WITH THAT, BY THE

11:45.027 --> 11:45.394
WAY.

11:45.460 --> 11:46.662
I'VE BEEN TRYING TO GET HIM TO

11:46.728 --> 11:48.363
POST OUR GERRYMANDERING PIECE

11:48.430 --> 11:50.165
FOR MONTHS, AND HE WON'T DO IT.

11:50.232 --> 11:51.567
COME ON, JIFFPOM, THROW US A

11:51.633 --> 11:55.003
FUCKING BONE, YOU ASSHOLE!

11:55.070 --> 11:57.372
THE POINT IS, ANY SOLUTION THAT

11:57.439 --> 11:59.341
MIGHT PUT AN END TO THAT IS

11:59.408 --> 12:00.976
WORTH AT LEAST CONSIDERING,

12:01.043 --> 12:01.977
SURELY.

12:02.044 --> 12:03.679
AND TO BE HONEST, I PERSONALLY

12:03.745 --> 12:05.214
THINK THERE IS A LOT TO BE SAID

12:05.280 --> 12:07.282
FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL.

12:07.349 --> 12:08.850
SO TONIGHT, LET'S TAKE A LOOK AT

12:08.917 --> 12:09.384
IT ‐‐ NOT THE POLITICS OF

12:09.451 --> 12:10.552
WHETHER IT CAN PASS, BUT WHAT IT

12:10.619 --> 12:12.287
ACTUALLY IS.

12:12.354 --> 12:13.322
AND WHENEVER THE SUBJECT COMES

12:13.388 --> 12:14.990
UP, YOU TEND TO HEAR THREE MAJOR

12:15.057 --> 12:18.694
CRITICISMS OF IT CONCERNING

12:18.760 --> 12:19.294
COST, WAIT TIMES, AND CHOICE.

12:19.361 --> 12:20.529
AND LET'S START WITH COST,

12:20.596 --> 12:21.964
BECAUSE CRITICS WILL TELL YOU

12:22.030 --> 12:23.832
THAT MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD

12:23.899 --> 12:24.399
SIMPLY INCREASE THE FEDERAL

12:24.466 --> 12:25.767
BUDGET TOO MUCH.

12:25.834 --> 12:27.436
>> THIS SICKO SOCIALISM WOULD

12:27.502 --> 12:29.071
COST ROUGHLY $32.6 TRILLION OVER

12:29.137 --> 12:37.212
10 YEARS.

12:37.279 --> 12:38.013
EVEN IF YOU DOUBLED TAX

12:38.080 --> 12:38.880
COLLECTIONS FROM INDIVIDUALS AND

12:38.947 --> 12:40.315
CORPORATIONS ‐‐ YES, THAT MEANS

12:40.382 --> 12:41.450
YOU WOULD BE PAYING TWICE WHAT

12:41.516 --> 12:44.820
YOU ALREADY DO IN TAXES ‐‐ THAT

12:44.886 --> 12:47.256
STILL DOESN'T COVER THE TAB.

12:47.322 --> 12:47.823
MY GOD, FREE HEALTH CARE IS

12:47.889 --> 12:49.391
EXPENSIVE.

12:49.458 --> 12:53.028
>> John: LOOK, I KNOW THAT

12:53.095 --> 12:54.229
SOUNDS DRAMATIC, BUT

12:54.296 --> 12:58.400
SARAH PALIN'S FOURTH ATTEMPT AT

12:58.467 --> 13:02.404
CLONING HERSELF ACTUALLY HAS A

13:02.471 --> 13:03.238
POINT THERE.

13:03.305 --> 13:03.972
MEDICARE FOR ALL WOULD,

13:04.039 --> 13:04.706
UNDENIABLY, BE EXPENSIVE.

13:04.773 --> 13:05.274
BUT THAT FACT NEEDS A LOT OF

13:05.340 --> 13:05.941
CONTEXT AROUND IT.

13:06.008 --> 13:09.244
FOR STARTERS, IT WOULD INCREASE

13:09.311 --> 13:09.878
THE FEDERAL BUDGET, YES, BUT IT

13:09.945 --> 13:10.779
WOULD ALSO ELIMINATE EMPLOYER

13:10.846 --> 13:11.980
SPENDING ON PREMIUMS AND YOUR

13:12.047 --> 13:13.615
SPENDING ON OUT‐OF‐POCKET COSTS.

13:13.682 --> 13:15.050
WOULD THOSE TWO CANCEL EACH

13:15.117 --> 13:15.917
OTHER OUT?

13:15.984 --> 13:17.486
THAT'S A GOOD QUESTION, AND THE

13:17.552 --> 13:18.487
ANSWER IS, NO ONE CAN POSSIBLY

13:18.553 --> 13:19.521
KNOW FOR SURE.

13:19.588 --> 13:23.258
THERE ARE TOO MANY VARIABLES.

13:23.325 --> 13:23.892
"THE TIMES" ASKED FIVE PROMINENT

13:23.959 --> 13:25.260
EXPERTS TO ESTIMATE NATIONAL

13:25.327 --> 13:26.862
HEALTH CARE SPENDING UNDER

13:26.928 --> 13:28.730
BERNIE'S PLAN AND THEY COMPARED

13:28.797 --> 13:29.631
THAT TO WHAT WE SPEND NOW, AND

13:29.698 --> 13:30.866
THE RESULTS RANGED FROM "IT

13:30.932 --> 13:32.367
WOULD ACTUALLY COST US LESS," TO

13:32.434 --> 13:34.202
"IT WOULD COST ABOUT THE SAME"

13:34.269 --> 13:35.737
TO "IT WOULD COST A FUCK OF A

13:35.804 --> 13:36.805
LOT MORE."

13:36.872 --> 13:38.540
AND I KNOW THAT EXTRA SHADING

13:38.607 --> 13:39.241
DOESN'T LOOK LIKE VERY MUCH, BUT

13:39.308 --> 13:41.043
BELIEVE ME, IT'S A FUCK OF A

13:41.109 --> 13:43.211
LOT.

13:43.278 --> 13:44.146
BUT LET'S SAY, JUST FOR

13:44.212 --> 13:45.881
ARGUMENT'S SAKE, OUR OVERALL

13:45.947 --> 13:47.582
SPENDING DID GO UP.

13:47.649 --> 13:50.752
WE WOULD BE GETTING A LOT FOR

13:50.753 --> 13:51.086
THAT MONEY.

13:51.119 --> 13:52.187
REMEMBER, 27 MILLION MORE PEOPLE

13:52.254 --> 13:53.488
WOULD BE COVERED, AND THEY WOULD

13:53.555 --> 13:58.827
BE COVERED WELL.

13:58.894 --> 14:00.128
BERNIE'S PLAN IS INCREDIBLY

14:00.195 --> 14:01.830
GENEROUS ‐‐ IT COVERS VISION,

14:01.897 --> 14:02.397
DENTAL, LONG‐TERM CARE, AND

14:02.464 --> 14:03.031
DRUGS.

14:03.098 --> 14:03.665
IN FACT, "MEDICARE FOR ALL" IS A

14:03.732 --> 14:04.833
MISLEADING TITLE, BECAUSE

14:04.900 --> 14:06.501
MEDICARE REQUIRES SOME CO‐PAYS

14:06.568 --> 14:07.803
AND OUT‐OF‐POCKET EXPENSES.

14:07.869 --> 14:08.770
AND BERNIE WILL EXCITEDLY TELL

14:08.837 --> 14:15.410
YOU HIS PLAN ELIMINATES THOSE.

14:15.477 --> 14:17.946
>> UNDER THE MEDICARE FOR ALL

14:18.013 --> 14:18.580
BILL THAT I WROTE, PREMIUMS ARE

14:18.647 --> 14:19.581
GONE, CO‐PAYMENTS ARE GONE,

14:19.648 --> 14:20.682
DEDUCTIBLES ARE GONE, ALL

14:20.749 --> 14:24.553
OUT‐OF‐POCKET EXPENSES ARE GONE.

14:24.619 --> 14:26.521
>> John: HE'S RIGHT.

14:26.588 --> 14:27.456
HOSPITAL BILLS ARE GONE!

14:27.522 --> 14:29.391
CO‐PAYMENTS ARE GONE!

14:29.458 --> 14:32.160
CELL PHONE PAYMENTS, GONE!

14:32.227 --> 14:33.762
FLAT TIRES, GONE!

14:33.829 --> 14:35.063
GEICO COMMERCIALS, GONE!

14:35.130 --> 14:37.766
ALL THE THINGS YOU HATE IN THIS

14:37.833 --> 14:38.967
WORLD WILL BE GONE, AND ALL THAT

14:39.034 --> 14:40.936
WILL REMAIN IS UNIVERSALLY

14:41.002 --> 14:42.738
ACCESSIBLE HEALTHCARE AND

14:42.804 --> 14:45.207
LAURA DERN.

14:45.273 --> 14:46.975
FINALLY, LIFE AS IT SHOULD BE.

14:47.042 --> 14:48.243
BERNIE'S PLAN ISN'T JUST

14:48.310 --> 14:49.277
MORE GENEROUS THAN MOST CURRENT

14:49.344 --> 14:51.346
PRIVATE INSURANCE PLANS, IT'S

14:51.413 --> 14:52.481
MORE GENEROUS THAN THE POLICY OF

14:52.547 --> 14:53.915
ANY SINGLE‐PAYER COUNTRY ON

14:53.982 --> 14:55.350
EARTH.

14:55.417 --> 14:57.119
AND THERE'S A GOOD CASE TO BE

14:57.185 --> 14:58.587
MADE THAT EVEN IF NATIONAL

14:58.653 --> 14:59.721
SPENDING WOUND UP HIGHER, WE

14:59.788 --> 15:01.890
MIGHT WIND UP WASTING LESS.

15:01.957 --> 15:04.693
RIGHT NOW, A LOT OF OUR HEALTH

15:04.760 --> 15:05.260
CARE SPENDING DOESN'T GO TO

15:05.327 --> 15:06.461
HEALTH CARE ‐‐ IT GOES TO

15:06.528 --> 15:08.096
ADMINISTRATIVE COSTS THAT COME

15:08.163 --> 15:08.730
WITH HAVING A VAST INSURANCE

15:08.797 --> 15:10.198
INDUSTRY.

15:10.265 --> 15:11.633
THAT IS CLEARLY WILDLY

15:11.700 --> 15:13.001
INEFFICIENT.

15:13.068 --> 15:14.436
AND CONSOLIDATING ALL HEALTH

15:14.503 --> 15:15.937
INSURANCE UNDER ONE ROOF WOULD

15:16.004 --> 15:17.205
GIVE THE GOVERNMENT FAR MORE

15:17.272 --> 15:18.673
LEVERAGE TO NEGOTIATE PRICES

15:18.740 --> 15:19.875
DOWN, BECAUSE, LOOK, IT IS NO

15:19.941 --> 15:21.910
SECRET, PRICES FOR PROCEDURES

15:21.977 --> 15:23.412
AND DRUGS ARE OUT OF CONTROL IN

15:23.478 --> 15:24.946
THE U. S.

15:25.013 --> 15:25.981
IT'S SO BAD, ONE INSURANCE

15:26.047 --> 15:27.916
PROVIDER IN UTAH RECENTLY

15:27.983 --> 15:29.551
STARTED OFFERING SOME OF ITS

15:29.618 --> 15:31.086
PARTICIPANTS CASH IF THEY WERE

15:31.153 --> 15:32.788
WILLING TO TRAVEL A LITTLE

15:32.854 --> 15:34.089
FURTHER THAN THEIR LOCAL

15:34.156 --> 15:36.558
PHARMACY TO FILL OUT THEIR

15:36.625 --> 15:38.827
PRESCRIPTION.

15:38.894 --> 15:39.895
>> IT'S CALLED "PHARMACEUTICAL

15:39.961 --> 15:41.029
TOURISM."

15:41.096 --> 15:42.531
HERE'S HOW IT WORKS.

15:42.597 --> 15:43.665
PEHP PUTS PATIENTS ON A PLANE

15:43.732 --> 15:44.566
AND FLIES THEM TO SAN DIEGO.

15:44.633 --> 15:45.767
FROM THERE, A PRIVATE CAR TAKES

15:45.834 --> 15:47.436
THEM ACROSS THE BORDER TO

15:47.502 --> 15:48.670
TIJUANA, MEXICO, WHERE THEIR

15:48.737 --> 15:50.172
PRESCRIPTION IS WAITING FOR

15:50.238 --> 15:51.807
THEM.

15:51.873 --> 15:53.542
THE ONLY DIFFERENCE, THE

15:53.608 --> 15:54.843
PRESCRIPTION COSTS ROUGHLY HALF

15:54.910 --> 15:56.211
THE PRICE.

15:56.278 --> 15:57.712
PEHP WILL GIVE PEOPLE WILLING TO

15:57.779 --> 15:59.915
TRAVEL AN ADDITIONAL $500 BACK.

15:59.981 --> 16:02.884
>> IT'S CHEAPER FOR US TO PAY

16:02.951 --> 16:04.986
FOR THE DRUG DOWN THERE, SEND

16:05.053 --> 16:06.588
THEM DOWN THERE, AND THEN GIVE

16:06.589 --> 16:06.954
THEM $500.

16:06.955 --> 16:10.459
>> John: THAT'S FUCKING CRAZY!

16:10.525 --> 16:13.128
GIVING YOU $500 TO GO TO MEXICO

16:13.195 --> 16:14.196
TO BUY DRUGS IS NOT WHAT YOUR

16:14.262 --> 16:16.665
INSURANCE PROVIDER SHOULD BE

16:16.731 --> 16:17.999
DOING.

16:18.066 --> 16:18.700
IT'S WHAT YOUR SKETCHY FRIEND

16:18.767 --> 16:21.102
MEREDITH SHOULD BE DOING BECAUSE

16:21.169 --> 16:24.706
SHE WANTS TO MAKE BRIANNA'S

16:24.773 --> 16:26.508
BACHELORETTE PARTY A TOTAL

16:26.575 --> 16:28.443
RAGER.

16:28.510 --> 16:29.377
"I'D GO MYSELF, BUT I HAVE

16:29.444 --> 16:30.946
OUTSTANDING WARRANTS."

16:31.012 --> 16:32.681
UNDER MEDICARE FOR ALL, THE

16:32.747 --> 16:34.249
GOVERNMENT WOULD BE A MUCH

16:34.316 --> 16:36.751
STRONGER NEGOTIATOR.

16:36.818 --> 16:38.019
NOW, YOU WOULDN'T WANT IT TO SET

16:38.086 --> 16:39.221
PRICES SO LOW THAT IT STIFLES

16:39.287 --> 16:40.055
INNOVATION OR BANKRUPTS DOCTORS,

16:40.121 --> 16:42.157
BUT THAT IS A BALANCE YOU'D NEED

16:42.224 --> 16:44.192
TO STRIKE.

16:44.259 --> 16:44.826
OVERALL YOU CAN'T DEFINITELY SAY

16:44.893 --> 16:45.694
IT WOULD BE MORE EXPENSIVE, BUT

16:45.760 --> 16:47.195
EVEN IF IT WAS, I PERSONALLY

16:47.262 --> 16:49.664
WOULD ARGUE IT WAS WORTH IT.

16:49.731 --> 16:51.233
AND EITHER WAY, COST IS A LOT

16:51.299 --> 16:53.101
MORE COMPLICATED ISSUE THAN JUST

16:53.168 --> 16:57.672
GOING ON TV AND SAYING

16:57.739 --> 17:00.375
"32.6 TAH‐RILLLION DOLLARS"

17:00.442 --> 17:10.185
LIKE TINA FEY DOING HER BEST

17:10.252 --> 17:12.320
ANYWAY, THE NEXT MAJOR CRITICISM

17:12.387 --> 17:13.722
OF MEDICARE FOR ALL CONCERNS

17:13.788 --> 17:14.556
WAIT TIMES.

17:14.623 --> 17:15.257
SPECIFICALLY, THAT IT WOULD

17:15.323 --> 17:16.426
RESULT IN RATIONING AND DELAYS

17:16.459 --> 17:16.824
TO CARE.

17:16.825 --> 17:17.425
>> IF YOU THINK IT'S FUN TO WAIT

17:17.492 --> 17:18.260
IN LINE AT THE DMV, YOU'RE GOING

17:18.326 --> 17:19.094
TO LOVE BERNIE SANDERS' WAIT

17:19.160 --> 17:19.661
TIMES FOR MEDICARE FOR ALL.

17:19.728 --> 17:20.695
>> IT LEADS TO THE KIND OF CARE

17:20.762 --> 17:21.329
THAT PEOPLE NOW HAVE IN ENGLAND

17:21.396 --> 17:22.264
OR CANADA, WHERE YOU HAVE TO

17:22.330 --> 17:22.797
WAIT IN LINE.

17:22.864 --> 17:23.465
>> JUST TAKE A LOOK AT CANADA OR

17:23.532 --> 17:24.165
THE U. K.

17:24.232 --> 17:25.867
IT MEANS LONG WAITING LINES, IT

17:25.934 --> 17:26.434
MEANS PEOPLE NOT GETTING THE

17:26.501 --> 17:28.503
HEALTH TREATMENTS THEY NEED.

17:28.570 --> 17:29.471
>> John: OKAY, I GET THAT NO ONE

17:29.538 --> 17:30.672
LIKES WAITING IN LINE FOR

17:30.739 --> 17:35.076
ANYTHING.

17:35.143 --> 17:35.744
I GET IT.

17:35.810 --> 17:36.444
MOST PEOPLE SEE THE LINE AT

17:36.511 --> 17:37.279
TRADER JOE'S AND EITHER ABANDON

17:37.345 --> 17:38.079
THEIR CART OR PULL THE FIRE

17:38.146 --> 17:39.080
ALARM AND SNEAK OUT WITH THEIR

17:39.147 --> 17:40.081
GROCERIES UNDETECTED.

17:40.148 --> 17:41.116
I'M NOT SAYING I'VE EVER DONE

17:41.182 --> 17:44.819
THAT, I'M JUST SAYING, I HAD A

17:44.886 --> 17:45.387
SHOW TO DO TONIGHT, AND WHO

17:45.453 --> 17:46.354
WANTS SOME PEANUT BUTTER

17:46.421 --> 17:52.861
PRETZELS?

17:52.928 --> 17:55.530
BUT, LOOK, AS WITH COST,

17:55.597 --> 17:56.798
COMPARISONS OF WAIT TIMES ARE

17:56.865 --> 17:57.866
VERY COMPLICATED.

17:57.933 --> 17:58.867
FOR ONE THING, THE INTERNATIONAL

17:58.934 --> 17:59.968
WAIT TIMES YOU HEAR ABOUT MOST

18:00.035 --> 18:00.835
OFTEN ARE FOR NON‐EMERGENCY

18:00.902 --> 18:02.137
SURGERIES, SUCH AS KNEE

18:02.203 --> 18:02.904
REPLACEMENTS.

18:02.971 --> 18:03.605
AND WHILE, YES, PEOPLE IN OTHER

18:03.672 --> 18:05.140
COUNTRIES DO SOMETIMES HAVE TO

18:05.206 --> 18:06.808
WAIT SLIGHTLY LONGER FOR SOME

18:06.875 --> 18:08.543
CARE, IT'S NOT LIKE AMERICANS

18:08.610 --> 18:09.277
AREN'T HAVING TO DO THAT RIGHT

18:09.344 --> 18:13.648
NOW ANYWAY.

18:13.715 --> 18:15.951
AMERICANS ARE JUST FORCED TO

18:16.017 --> 18:19.421
WAIT DUE TO THE EXPENSE.

18:19.487 --> 18:21.156
ABOUT HALF OF U. S. ADULTS SAY

18:21.222 --> 18:24.492
THEY OR A FAMILY MEMBER PUT OFF

18:24.559 --> 18:25.126
OR SKIPPED CARE IN THE PAST YEAR

18:25.193 --> 18:26.428
BECAUSE OF THE COST, AND ABOUT

18:26.494 --> 18:27.329
ONE IN EIGHT SAY THEIR MEDICAL

18:27.395 --> 18:28.730
CONDITION GOT WORSE BECAUSE OF

18:28.797 --> 18:30.532
THAT DELAY.

18:30.599 --> 18:32.601
AS FOR THE UNINSURED, THEY CAN

18:32.667 --> 18:36.605
WIND UP HAVING TO WAIT ON A

18:36.671 --> 18:37.205
LITERAL LINE SEEKING CARE WITH

18:37.272 --> 18:38.640
AID GROUPS LIKE REMOTE AREA

18:38.707 --> 18:39.374
MEDICAL, AN ORGANIZATION THAT

18:39.441 --> 18:40.675
TRAVELS THE COUNTRY SETTING UP

18:40.742 --> 18:43.111
MOBILE CLINICS TO TREAT PEOPLE

18:43.178 --> 18:43.745
FOR FREE AND WHICH DRAWS MASSIVE

18:43.812 --> 18:46.648
LINES WHEREVER IT GOES.

18:46.715 --> 18:48.216
>> HAVING GOT THEIR PLACE IN

18:48.283 --> 18:49.884
LINE, MANY CAMPED OUT FOR THE

18:49.951 --> 18:53.521
NIGHT.

18:53.588 --> 18:55.357
BEFORE DAWN, THIS WAS THE MOMENT

18:55.423 --> 18:56.591
THEY WERE WAITING FOR.

18:56.658 --> 18:57.292
>> NUMBER ONE, COME ON DOWN.

18:57.359 --> 18:58.793
NUMBER TWO.

18:58.860 --> 19:01.329
NUMBER THREE.

19:01.396 --> 19:02.864
>> ONE BY ONE, PATIENTS ARE LET

19:02.931 --> 19:04.299
IN FOR THEIR CHANCE OF A VISIT

19:04.366 --> 19:05.400
TO A DOCTOR, A DENTIST, AND AN

19:05.467 --> 19:07.335
OPTICIAN.

19:07.402 --> 19:08.837
AT FIRST, R. A. M. FOCUSED ON

19:08.903 --> 19:09.671
COMMUNITIES IN REMOTE AREAS IN

19:09.738 --> 19:11.006
DEVELOPING COUNTRIES.

19:11.072 --> 19:12.874
BUT STAN SAYS HE GRADUALLY CAME

19:12.941 --> 19:14.275
TO REALIZE THE DEPTH OF NEED IN

19:14.342 --> 19:16.678
THE U. S.

19:16.745 --> 19:19.080
>> TODAY, OH, 80% OR MORE OF

19:19.147 --> 19:19.614
WHAT WE DO IS HERE IN THE

19:19.681 --> 19:20.215
UNITED STATES.

19:20.281 --> 19:21.282
>> John: IT'S UNBELIEVABLE TO ME

19:21.349 --> 19:23.385
THAT THAT IS THE CASE.

19:23.451 --> 19:24.719
NORMALLY, AMERICANS HATE IT WHEN

19:24.786 --> 19:25.787
A BRITISH PERSON COMES OVER TO

19:25.854 --> 19:27.555
DIAGNOSE WHAT'S WRONG WITH YOU.

19:27.622 --> 19:29.090
BELIEVE ME, SIX SEASONS OF

19:29.157 --> 19:30.792
YOUTUBE COMMENTS HAVE MADE THAT

19:30.859 --> 19:34.562
VERY FUCKING CLEAR.

19:34.629 --> 19:36.865
THE INTERNET IS MEAN!

19:36.931 --> 19:38.500
AND FOR ALL CRITICS' TALK OF

19:38.566 --> 19:40.168
WAIT TIMES OVERSEAS, IT'S WORTH

19:40.235 --> 19:41.736
KNOWING, LESS THAN 10% OF

19:41.803 --> 19:50.178
BRITONS OR CANADIANS SAY THEIR

19:50.245 --> 19:50.912
HEALTH SYSTEM NEEDS TO BE

19:50.979 --> 19:51.746
"REBUILT COMPLETELY," COMPARED

19:51.813 --> 19:52.847
TO 23% OF PEOPLE HERE IN THE

19:52.881 --> 19:53.214
UNITED STATES.

19:53.248 --> 19:54.749
IN FACT, WHEN LONDON HOSTED THE

19:54.816 --> 19:55.350
2012 OLYMPICS, THE OPENING

19:55.417 --> 19:56.551
CEREMONY FEATURED A 4.5‐MINUTE

19:56.618 --> 19:57.118
CELEBRATION OF THE NATIONAL

19:57.185 --> 19:58.553
HEALTH SERVICE FEATURING

19:58.620 --> 20:00.689
SWING‐DANCING DOCTORS AND NURSES

20:00.755 --> 20:02.490
AND CHILDREN JUMPING UP AND DOWN

20:02.557 --> 20:05.393
ON HOSPITAL BEDS.

20:05.460 --> 20:08.096
AS FOR CANADA, THEY ADORE THEIR

20:08.163 --> 20:09.631
HEALTH SERVICE SO MUCH THAT WHEN

20:09.698 --> 20:11.366
THEY HAD A CONTEST FOR THE

20:11.433 --> 20:12.867
GREATEST CANADIAN OF ALL TIME,

20:12.934 --> 20:14.202
THIS WAS THE RESULT:

20:14.269 --> 20:15.403
>> THE GREATEST CANADIAN AS

20:15.470 --> 20:19.074
DECIDED BY YOU IS...

20:19.140 --> 20:25.413
>> TOMMYYYY DOUGLAS!

20:25.480 --> 20:27.348
>> THE MOTHER OF ALL NATIONAL

20:27.415 --> 20:28.083
TITLES GOES TO THE FATHER OF

20:28.149 --> 20:29.718
MEDICARE.

20:29.784 --> 20:31.119
>> TOMMY DOUGLAS!

20:31.186 --> 20:32.153
YEAH!

20:32.220 --> 20:33.054
>> John: YEAH!

20:33.121 --> 20:34.889
TOMMY DOUGLAS!

20:34.956 --> 20:35.623
YEAH!

20:35.690 --> 20:39.561
WHOO!

20:39.627 --> 20:40.662
I MEAN, HIS MASTERS THESIS,

20:40.729 --> 20:41.396
"THE PROBLEMS OF THE SUBNORMAL

20:41.463 --> 20:43.498
FAMILY" ENDORSED EUGENICS BUT

20:43.565 --> 20:45.133
WE'RE GOING TO IGNORE THAT

20:45.200 --> 20:46.568
'CAUSE IT WAS THE 1930s AND NO

20:46.634 --> 20:47.202
ONE'S PERFECT!

20:47.268 --> 20:48.236
GIVE IT UP FOR TOMMY!

20:48.303 --> 20:52.407
WHOO!

20:52.474 --> 20:53.475
AND THEN THERE'S THE FINAL BIG

20:53.541 --> 20:54.909
CRITICISM OF MEDICARE FOR ALL,

20:54.976 --> 20:56.644
WHICH INVOLVES CHOICE ‐‐

20:56.711 --> 20:57.746
SPECIFICALLY, THAT IT WOULD TAKE

20:57.812 --> 20:59.147
AWAY OUR ABILITY TO CHOOSE THE

20:59.214 --> 21:00.915
SORT OF HEALTH COVERAGE THAT WE

21:00.982 --> 21:02.150
RECEIVE.

21:02.217 --> 21:03.918
>> WHEN I HEAR THAT HEALTHCARE

21:03.985 --> 21:05.487
IS A RIGHT, WHAT I HEAR IS,

21:05.553 --> 21:07.088
HEALTH CARE WILL NO LONGER HAVE

21:07.155 --> 21:08.923
CHOICES.

21:08.990 --> 21:10.391
>> UNDER MEDICARE FOR ALL, YOUR

21:10.458 --> 21:11.960
CHOICE OF HEALTH COVERAGE

21:12.026 --> 21:13.428
DISAPPEARS.

21:13.495 --> 21:14.929
>> AMERICANS ARE STILL

21:14.996 --> 21:16.698
AMERICANS.

21:16.765 --> 21:18.032
WE'RE NOT SOCIALISTS, WE'RE NOT

21:18.099 --> 21:19.100
COMMUNISTS.

21:19.134 --> 21:19.500
WE LIKE CHOICE.

21:19.534 --> 21:20.268
AND WE LIKE TO HAVE CHOICE IN

21:20.335 --> 21:21.936
HEALTHCARE ESPECIALLY.

21:22.003 --> 21:23.938
>> John: RIGHT, RIGHT, AMERICANS

21:24.005 --> 21:24.839
ARE AMERICANS.

21:24.906 --> 21:26.241
IT'S TRUE.

21:26.307 --> 21:27.709
AND THEY DO LIKE HAVING CHOICES.

21:27.776 --> 21:29.310
IT'S WHY THE NUMBER ONE RATED

21:29.377 --> 21:31.613
SERIES ON NETFLIX IS

21:31.679 --> 21:32.147
"FORTY MINUTES OF LOOKING

21:32.213 --> 21:32.781
THROUGH THE MENU FOR SOMETHING

21:32.847 --> 21:38.052
GOOD."

21:38.119 --> 21:39.420
IT'S BASICALLY AMERICA'S NEW

21:39.487 --> 21:40.321
NATIONAL PASTIME.

21:40.388 --> 21:41.923
AND THE FACT YOU'RE APPLAUDING

21:41.990 --> 21:43.158
THAT IS A FULL COSIGN ON THAT

21:43.224 --> 21:43.558
CONCEPT.

21:43.625 --> 21:44.759
BUT THE FACT IS, OUR CURRENT

21:44.826 --> 21:46.227
SYSTEM LIMITS AMERICANS' CHOICES

21:46.294 --> 21:48.997
FAR MORE THAN IT EXPANDS THEM.

21:49.063 --> 21:49.831
FOR STARTERS, AS A PRACTICAL

21:49.898 --> 21:52.033
MATTER, MOST OF US DON'T CHOOSE

21:52.100 --> 21:54.969
OUR HEALTH INSURANCE ‐‐ WE GET

21:55.036 --> 21:55.470
WHAT WE GET THROUGH OUR

21:55.537 --> 21:55.937
EMPLOYER.

21:56.004 --> 21:58.873
AND BECAUSE OF THAT, CHOICES

21:58.940 --> 21:59.474
LIKE CHANGING JOBS CAN BECOME

21:59.541 --> 22:01.843
SIGNIFICANTLY HARDER.

22:01.910 --> 22:03.144
AND NOT JUST THAT ‐‐ OFTENTIMES,

22:03.211 --> 22:04.445
YOUR CHOICE OF DOCTORS AND

22:04.512 --> 22:05.647
HOSPITALS IS SEVERELY LIMITED BY

22:05.713 --> 22:07.182
WHICH ONES YOUR INSURANCE WILL

22:07.248 --> 22:08.550
COVER.

22:08.616 --> 22:10.051
GOING OUT OF YOUR INSURER'S

22:10.118 --> 22:11.386
NETWORK CAN BE PROHIBITIVELY

22:11.452 --> 22:12.987
EXPENSIVE.

22:13.054 --> 22:14.722
THAT IS WHY PEOPLE BEND OVER

22:14.789 --> 22:16.090
BACKWARDS TO STAY IN‐NETWORK,

22:16.157 --> 22:18.226
AND EVEN WHEN THEY DO THAT, IT

22:18.293 --> 22:21.129
CAN STILL ALL GO HORRIBLY WRONG.

22:21.196 --> 22:23.331
>> WHILE CAMPAIGNING IN 2018,

22:23.398 --> 22:24.532
DEMOCRATIC CONGRESSWOMAN

22:24.599 --> 22:25.667
KATIE PORTER'S APPENDIX BURST.

22:25.733 --> 22:26.801
HER FIRST THOUGHT?

22:26.868 --> 22:28.036
"HOW MUCH WOULD IT COST?"

22:28.102 --> 22:31.940
>> I DIDN'T CALL AN AMBULANCE

22:32.006 --> 22:32.607
'CAUSE I KNEW IT CAN COST A LOT

22:32.674 --> 22:33.641
IF YOU CALL AN AMBULANCE.

22:33.708 --> 22:34.776
AND I HAD SPECIFICALLY HAD MY

22:34.843 --> 22:36.010
MANAGER DRIVE ME NOT TO THE

22:36.077 --> 22:37.178
CLOSEST HOSPITAL, BUT TO THE

22:37.245 --> 22:39.581
IN‐NETWORK HOSPITAL.

22:39.647 --> 22:41.216
>> EVEN THOUGH THE HOSPITAL WAS

22:41.282 --> 22:42.383
IN HER NETWORK, THE SURGEON WHO

22:42.450 --> 22:43.685
HELPED SAVE PORTER'S LIFE WAS

22:43.751 --> 22:45.119
NOT, AND SHE GOT A BILL FOR

22:45.186 --> 22:48.289
NEARLY $3,000.

22:48.356 --> 22:49.724
>> John: EXACTLY.

22:49.791 --> 22:51.059
YOU CAN GET FUCKED BY TAKING AN

22:51.125 --> 22:52.460
AMBULANCE, YOU CAN FUCKED BY

22:52.527 --> 22:54.462
GOING TO THE WRONG HOSPITAL, OR

22:54.529 --> 22:55.864
YOU CAN FUCKED BY GOING TO THE

22:55.930 --> 22:59.767
RIGHT HOSPITAL BUT GETTING THE

22:59.834 --> 23:01.903
WRONG SURGEON.

23:01.970 --> 23:02.871
THE AMERICAN HEALTHCARE SYSTEM

23:02.937 --> 23:03.771
GIVES YOU SO MANY CHOICES AS TO

23:03.838 --> 23:05.273
HOW YOU WANT TO GET FUCKED.

23:05.340 --> 23:06.507
IT TRULY IS THE KAMA SUTRA OF

23:06.574 --> 23:09.244
HEALTHCARE.

23:09.310 --> 23:10.511
AND UNDER MEDICARE FOR ALL, THAT

23:10.578 --> 23:12.680
SCENARIO WOULD NOT HAPPEN ‐‐ NO

23:12.747 --> 23:13.314
DOCTOR WOULD BE OUT‐OF‐NETWORK

23:13.381 --> 23:15.049
BECAUSE THERE WOULDN'T BE A

23:15.116 --> 23:16.317
NETWORK AT ALL.

23:16.384 --> 23:17.919
AND THE TRUTH ABOUT AMERICANS'

23:17.986 --> 23:19.854
CURRENT ILLUSION OF CHOICE IS

23:19.921 --> 23:20.989
THAT, TOO OFTEN, BECAUSE OF

23:21.055 --> 23:22.991
COST, THE CHOICES OUR CURRENT

23:23.057 --> 23:25.793
SYSTEM FORCES PEOPLE TO MAKE ARE

23:25.860 --> 23:28.663
ONES LIKE THIS:

23:28.730 --> 23:31.032
>> I PRIORITIZE THE HEART STUFF

23:31.099 --> 23:33.434
OVER THE INSULIN BECAUSE THE

23:33.501 --> 23:37.105
HEART STUFF IS MORE IMMEDIATE.

23:37.171 --> 23:39.040
I KNOW OVER TIME, YOU KNOW,

23:39.107 --> 23:40.141
DIABETES WILL KILL ME, BUT IT'LL

23:40.208 --> 23:42.777
TAKE A LONGER TIME AND I KNOW

23:42.844 --> 23:45.280
THAT WITHOUT THE HEART FAILURE

23:45.346 --> 23:48.249
DRUGS, I ONLY HAVE 13% FUNCTION

23:48.316 --> 23:50.318
OF MY HEART.

23:50.385 --> 23:53.121
I DON'T WANT TO PLAY WITH THAT.

23:53.187 --> 23:55.423
>> John: THAT'S OBVIOUSLY

23:55.490 --> 23:57.125
TERRIBLE.

23:57.191 --> 24:02.263
A HUMANE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM

24:02.330 --> 24:03.164
SHOULD NOT REQUIRE PEOPLE TO

24:03.231 --> 24:03.932
PICK THEIR FAVORITE ORGAN.

24:03.998 --> 24:04.699
ALTHOUGH, FOR THE RECORD, IF

24:04.766 --> 24:05.400
YOU'RE EVER ASKING ME MY

24:05.466 --> 24:06.834
FAVORITE ORGAN, I'M GOING SPLEEN

24:06.835 --> 24:07.168
EVERY TIME.

24:07.201 --> 24:07.936
NOW, I KNOW THE BRAIN AND THE

24:08.002 --> 24:08.770
HEART GET ALL THE ATTENTION, BUT

24:08.836 --> 24:09.537
I'M TELLING YOU, WHEN IT COMES

24:09.604 --> 24:11.272
TO FILTERING BLOOD, YOU CAN'T GO

24:11.339 --> 24:11.706
WRONG WITH A SPLEEN.

24:11.773 --> 24:12.240
#ImASpleenStan.

24:12.307 --> 24:18.246
#YasSpleen.

24:18.313 --> 24:21.582
SO THOSE ARE THE THREE MAIN

24:21.649 --> 24:22.483
CRITICISMS OF MEDICARE FOR ALL.

24:22.550 --> 24:23.685
AND I SHOULD SAY, IT IS NOT JUST

24:23.751 --> 24:25.019
PEOPLE ON THE RIGHT WHO RAISE

24:25.086 --> 24:26.955
THEM.

24:27.021 --> 24:27.922
SOME DEMOCRATS HAVE

24:27.989 --> 24:29.424
RESERVATIONS TOO.

24:29.490 --> 24:30.425
PETE BUTTIGIEG, FOR INSTANCE,

24:30.491 --> 24:31.225
PREFERS A DIFFERENT CONCEPT TO

24:31.292 --> 24:32.794
MEDICARE FOR ALL BUT WITH A

24:32.860 --> 24:34.228
CATCHILY SIMILAR NAME.

24:34.295 --> 24:38.566
>> MY HEALTH CARE VISION IS

24:38.633 --> 24:39.200
MEDICARE FOR ALL WHO WANT IT ‐‐

24:39.267 --> 24:40.134
LET EVERY AMERICAN HAVE THE

24:40.201 --> 24:41.502
CHOICE TO WALK AWAY FROM THE

24:41.569 --> 24:43.237
CORPORATE PRIVATE PLANS AND

24:43.304 --> 24:45.373
TOWARDS SOMETHING BETTER, BUT

24:45.440 --> 24:47.508
WHEN THEY'RE READY, BECAUSE I

24:47.575 --> 24:48.076
TRUST AMERICANS TO MAKE THAT

24:48.142 --> 24:48.943
RIGHT CHOICE.

24:49.010 --> 24:49.744
>> John: OKAY, WELL, HOLD ON

24:49.811 --> 24:50.878
THERE.

24:50.945 --> 24:52.113
YOU TRUST AMERICANS TO MAKE THE

24:52.180 --> 24:53.014
RIGHT CHOICE?

24:53.081 --> 24:54.115
YOU KNOW AMERICANS CHOOSE TO

24:54.182 --> 24:56.084
DRINK BUD LIGHT, RIGHT?

24:56.150 --> 24:57.251
WHICH DOESN'T TASTE LIKE BEER SO

24:57.318 --> 24:59.420
MUCH AS IT TASTES LIKE IF BEER

24:59.487 --> 25:00.888
SOMEHOW DIED AND WAS DISCOVERED

25:00.955 --> 25:02.023
IN ITS APARTMENT THREE WEEKS

25:02.090 --> 25:08.496
LATER.

25:08.563 --> 25:09.297
BUT WHAT BUTTIGIEG IS REFERRING

25:09.364 --> 25:10.098
TO WHEN HE SAYS "MEDICARE FOR

25:10.164 --> 25:11.332
ALL WHO WANT IT" IS BASICALLY

25:11.399 --> 25:12.367
THE PUBLIC OPTION ‐‐ THAT IS

25:12.433 --> 25:12.934
WHERE THE GOVERNMENT DOESN'T

25:13.001 --> 25:13.668
REPLACE THE PRIVATE INSURANCE

25:13.735 --> 25:14.702
SYSTEM, IT JUST INTRODUCES ITS

25:14.769 --> 25:15.570
OWN PLAN THAT WOULD COMPETE WITH

25:15.636 --> 25:16.838
IT.

25:16.904 --> 25:17.772
AND IT WOULD DEFINITELY BE AN

25:17.839 --> 25:19.207
IMPROVEMENT OVER WHAT WE HAVE

25:19.273 --> 25:20.008
NOW.

25:20.074 --> 25:21.209
THE PROBLEM IS, IT WOULD LEAVE

25:21.275 --> 25:21.876
SO MUCH OF OUR CURRENT INSURANCE

25:21.943 --> 25:22.877
INFRASTRUCTURE ‐‐ WITH ALL OF

25:22.944 --> 25:26.948
ITS PROBLEMS ‐‐ INTACT.

25:27.015 --> 25:27.849
SO THAT'S LIKE BEING OFFERED A

25:27.915 --> 25:28.883
SHIT SANDWICH OR A SLIGHTLY

25:28.950 --> 25:32.687
SMALLER SHIT SANDWICH WITH GUAC.

25:32.754 --> 25:33.855
I MEAN, I GUESS I'LL TAKE THE

25:33.921 --> 25:34.989
SECOND ONE IF YOU'RE ASKING, BUT

25:35.056 --> 25:35.690
HONESTLY, THE LACK OF GUAC

25:35.757 --> 25:40.728
WASN'T REALLY MY MAIN CONCERN.

25:40.795 --> 25:42.263
AND I'M NOT SAYING ANY OF THIS

25:42.330 --> 25:44.098
WOULD BE EASY.

25:44.165 --> 25:51.472
A LOT WOULD HAVE TO BE FIGURED

25:51.539 --> 25:52.407
OUT, FROM HOW TO IMPOSE THE

25:52.473 --> 25:53.174
TAXES TO PAY FOR IT IN AN

25:53.241 --> 25:54.275
EQUITABLE WAY, TO THE

25:54.342 --> 25:54.842
CONSEQUENCES OF ELIMINATING

25:54.909 --> 25:55.643
THE ENTIRE PRIVATE HEALTH

25:55.710 --> 25:56.978
INSURANCE INDUSTRY, WHICH BY ONE

25:57.045 --> 25:57.478
ESTIMATE COULD DISPLACE

25:57.545 --> 25:58.246
1.8 MILLION WORKERS.

25:58.312 --> 25:59.580
THAT'S A LEGITIMATE THING TO BE

25:59.647 --> 26:01.049
CONCERNED ABOUT, AND ANY PLAN

26:01.115 --> 26:02.784
WOULD HAVE TO BE DESIGNED AND

26:02.850 --> 26:04.485
ROLLED OUT VERY, VERY CAREFULLY.

26:04.552 --> 26:06.587
THAT'S WHY BOTH WARREN AND

26:06.654 --> 26:08.489
SANDERS TALK ABOUT THE NEED FOR

26:08.556 --> 26:10.224
TRANSITION PLANS FOR WORKERS IN

26:10.291 --> 26:12.326
THEIR PROPOSALS.

26:12.393 --> 26:13.594
AND I GET THAT BIG CHANGE IS

26:13.661 --> 26:16.164
SCARY.

26:16.230 --> 26:17.565
IT'S HUMAN NATURE TO PREFER THE

26:17.632 --> 26:18.199
DEVIL YOU KNOW OVER AN UNCERTAIN

26:18.266 --> 26:18.866
ALTERNATIVE.

26:18.933 --> 26:20.401
BUT THE DEVIL YOU KNOW IS STILL

26:20.468 --> 26:21.769
A DEVIL.

26:21.836 --> 26:23.504
AND IT IS EASY TO FORGET THAT.

26:23.571 --> 26:24.305
I SHIT ON BRITAIN A LOT ON THIS

26:24.372 --> 26:26.941
SHOW, AND I'M NOT GOING TO STOP

26:27.008 --> 26:30.244
ANYTIME SOON, BUT ONE THING

26:30.311 --> 26:31.345
BRITAIN DOES WELL IS THE

26:31.412 --> 26:33.181
NATIONAL HEALTH SERVICE.

26:33.247 --> 26:35.183
IT'S NOT PERFECT ‐‐ I'M NOT

26:35.249 --> 26:38.019
GOING TO SWING‐DANCE ON A

26:38.086 --> 26:40.254
FUCKING BED ABOUT IT ‐‐ BUT I'LL

26:40.321 --> 26:41.355
BE HONEST WITH YOU, I'VE NEVER

26:41.422 --> 26:42.523
HAD A BAD EXPERIENCE, AND I

26:42.590 --> 26:43.624
DON'T KNOW ANYONE WHO HAS.

26:43.691 --> 26:45.593
BUT SINCE MOVING TO AMERICA, I

26:45.660 --> 26:47.595
DON'T THINK I'VE MET ANYONE

26:47.662 --> 26:50.364
DOESN'T HAVE AT LEAST ONE

26:50.431 --> 26:50.998
INSURANCE INDUSTRY HORROR STORY.

26:51.065 --> 26:51.732
AT THIS POINT, THE U. S.

26:51.799 --> 26:52.967
NATIONAL ANTHEM SHOULD JUST BE

26:53.034 --> 26:54.702
EVERYONE IN A STADIUM YELLING

26:54.769 --> 26:55.937
ABOUT THEIR INSURANCE COMPANY

26:56.003 --> 27:02.243
FOR 2.5 MINUTES.

27:02.310 --> 27:02.743
SO FOR WHAT IT'S WORTH,

27:02.810 --> 27:04.011
PERSONALLY, I AM IN FAVOR OF

27:04.078 --> 27:05.246
SOME VERSION OF CAREFULLY

27:05.313 --> 27:06.948
DESIGNED UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE.

27:07.014 --> 27:08.116
AND I'LL OWN ALL THE THINGS

27:08.182 --> 27:08.983
ABOUT IT THAT ARE DIFFICULT ‐‐

27:09.050 --> 27:10.284
INCLUDING THE FACT THAT

27:10.351 --> 27:11.953
POLITICALLY, IT WOULD BE

27:12.019 --> 27:12.553
INCREDIBLY HARD TO GET PASSED.

27:12.620 --> 27:13.121
BUT IN RETURN, ANYONE WHO'S

27:13.187 --> 27:16.090
RESISTANT TO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE

27:16.157 --> 27:18.893
IS GOING TO HAVE TO OWN ALL THE

27:18.960 --> 27:20.428
FLAWS OF OUR CURRENT SYSTEM ‐‐

27:20.495 --> 27:21.496
ONE IN WHICH, WHEN AMERICANS GET
