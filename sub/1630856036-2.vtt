00:43.794 --> 00:45.504
<i>Sometimes a person looks at you,</i>

00:45.504 --> 00:49.967
<i>and immediately, you know
you'll remember it till the day you die.</i>

00:54.388 --> 00:58.225
<i>In that long month on the road,
we saw every corner of Cornwall.</i>

00:58.976 --> 01:02.145
<i>Every town, every beach, every landscape.</i>

01:04.815 --> 01:08.402
<i>But real life was going on elsewhere,
and I couldn't avoid it forever.</i>

01:10.737 --> 01:13.490
<i>Conchita had spent the last month
trying to be a mother,</i>

01:13.490 --> 01:16.994
<i>while I had spent it wondering
how on earth to be without one.</i>

01:17.786 --> 01:20.038
You haven't replied to any
of your sister's letters.

01:20.706 --> 01:24.251
Four weeks since we left London,
and you've not once been yourself.

01:24.251 --> 01:26.378
Well, maybe I'm not who you think I am.

01:27.796 --> 01:30.674
Well, Conchita will be glad
of a relaxing weekend without the baby.

01:31.258 --> 01:34.011
The house she's taken in Runnymede
is simply beautiful.

01:34.011 --> 01:36.013
<i>A weekend, just you girls.</i>

01:36.013 --> 01:37.556
<i>And Conchita can put her feet up.</i>

01:52.863 --> 01:54.698
Goodness, what a lady you are.

01:54.698 --> 01:56.742
All I've ever wanted to be.

01:56.742 --> 01:59.870
So, dancing first, Honoria,
or are you desperate to start gambling?

01:59.870 --> 02:02.414
I'll start the gambling.
I bet during that handstand,

02:02.414 --> 02:05.584
you remembered it's only four weeks
since you gave birth.

02:11.298 --> 02:13.300
Oh, my God. It's Nan. Come on!

02:18.305 --> 02:19.306
Whoa.

02:24.228 --> 02:26.355
Oh, my gosh. Are you actually here?

02:26.355 --> 02:27.689
- Are you real?
- I am.

02:27.689 --> 02:29.816
- Or might you go again?
- I am.

02:29.816 --> 02:31.944
- Oh, my gosh.
- How are you?

02:31.944 --> 02:35.280
Wrecked. A whole person
came out of me, and I'm ruined forever.

02:35.280 --> 02:38.909
But Minnie's divine, and nobody even
looks at you once you're a mother, so--

02:38.909 --> 02:41.370
Anyway, let's get a drink before
we melt into a puddle.

02:49.211 --> 02:52.756
Lady Wild Times keeping watch.
Hi, Honoria.

02:52.756 --> 02:53.966
The elegance.

02:56.885 --> 02:59.346
I have no idea why my brother
leaves home so often.

02:59.346 --> 03:02.599
- Would you like a drink?
- No, thank you.

03:02.599 --> 03:04.142
I mean, what are we supposed to do?

03:05.018 --> 03:06.854
Conchita, I need to talk to you
about something.

03:06.854 --> 03:09.022
Leaving so suddenly
when you promised you'd be here?

03:09.022 --> 03:12.568
I am sorry I wasn't here when--
I was a mess. I just wouldn't--

03:12.568 --> 03:15.571
- You should have seen the state I was in.
- Can we just please go inside and talk?

03:16.154 --> 03:17.906
You can't think how much
we have to tell you, Nan.

03:17.906 --> 03:20.701
The balls we've been to. The opera.

03:20.701 --> 03:22.286
God. Opera's endless.

03:22.286 --> 03:24.663
Mabel ripped her skirt and fell
on her face in front of lord somebody.

03:24.663 --> 03:27.958
Well, Lizzy got bit by a spider
at the races, and Jinny's done nothing

03:27.958 --> 03:30.878
- but dance with Lord Seadown.
- Three times, maybe four.

03:30.878 --> 03:33.589
They're virtually engaged.
I mean, we're virtually sisters-in-law.

03:33.589 --> 03:35.924
- Lizzy danced with Seadown too.
- Yeah. Once.

03:37.634 --> 03:39.094
A whole weekend without mothers.

03:41.013 --> 03:42.890
Now, we have the whole weekend
for whatever we like.

03:42.890 --> 03:47.561
And as your chaperone, I insist
you behave exactly as I say.

03:47.561 --> 03:50.606
First things first, down your drinks
and go down the lawn,

03:50.606 --> 03:52.191
and spin as fast as ever as you can.

03:52.191 --> 03:53.567
Go, go, go!

03:58.739 --> 04:01.074
- Mother sends her love.
- Whose mother?

04:07.831 --> 04:09.291
A whirlwind of fun, aren't they?

04:18.175 --> 04:19.384
Look out!

04:29.228 --> 04:31.438
Who's this? I thought it was just us.

04:31.438 --> 04:33.106
Richard, what on earth are you doing?

04:36.568 --> 04:37.945
Now she's calm.

04:39.863 --> 04:40.989
Conchita.

04:42.616 --> 04:44.201
Sorry to bring you all off course.

04:44.785 --> 04:47.454
And you, such an accomplished rider,
Mr. Dawnly.

04:48.205 --> 04:49.456
Well, look who it is.

04:49.456 --> 04:52.125
Conchita, what are you playing at?

04:52.125 --> 04:54.169
You're the one galloping
into our girls' weekend.

04:54.169 --> 04:56.797
- You knew I was staying down the road.
- I'm here with my friends, Dicky.

04:56.797 --> 04:58.257
- It's Seadown.
- Don't look.

04:58.257 --> 04:59.550
Make a face
like I've said something smart.

04:59.550 --> 05:01.718
But seeing as you're all here,

05:01.718 --> 05:04.263
and we're all pretending
not to notice how sweaty we are...

05:04.263 --> 05:06.849
I hope we're not improper, Honoria.

05:07.516 --> 05:10.269
- It's just, there'd be a fuss, that's all.
- There'd be more than a fuss.

05:10.269 --> 05:12.312
It's one drink.
We're only being hospitable.

05:12.896 --> 05:15.983
Dick, I'm sorry
Miles can't control his horse.

05:15.983 --> 05:18.235
But as you well know,
when a creature's born wild,

05:18.235 --> 05:20.362
they're never truly to be tamed.

05:22.447 --> 05:25.367
Now, it's such a scorching day.

05:26.243 --> 05:29.288
And the question is,
once we've all had our one drink,

05:30.205 --> 05:32.082
what else might we do that's refreshing?

05:39.923 --> 05:40.924
Come on.

05:41.466 --> 05:42.676
Come on!

05:48.098 --> 05:49.391
Come on, Honoria!

06:22.382 --> 06:23.425
Hi, Honoria.

07:41.128 --> 07:44.006
Yes, but if it were to get out
that we were here unchaperoned--

07:44.006 --> 07:45.883
What must Lord Seadown think?

07:45.883 --> 07:48.969
- We'll get a reputation for--
- For what? Not being miserable?

07:48.969 --> 07:51.346
- Well, I'm happy with that.
- There would be an almighty row,

07:51.346 --> 07:52.806
- and you know it.
- Jinny,

07:52.806 --> 07:55.851
you do know I'm married, right?
I'm chaperoning.

07:55.851 --> 07:58.103
I'm a pillar of respectability.

07:58.103 --> 08:00.647
I mean, I guess Miss Testvalley's
in the lodge.

08:00.647 --> 08:03.984
Since when were we ever shy of a party?

08:03.984 --> 08:07.863
Girls, have you not noticed?
We're not them. We're Americans.

08:07.863 --> 08:10.490
When did we ever care
what people think of us?

08:10.490 --> 08:13.493
I mean, the English are so fascinated
by their history.

08:13.493 --> 08:15.829
Well, we have a history
of being fascinating.

08:15.829 --> 08:17.831
It's time that they learn from us.

08:18.582 --> 08:20.209
I didn't bring any party clothes.

08:20.209 --> 08:21.627
I virtually just bought night clothes.

08:21.627 --> 08:24.087
I'm sure Seadown won't complain.

08:24.087 --> 08:26.381
Mabel, I only danced with him three times.

08:26.381 --> 08:28.425
- Or four.
- Or four.

08:28.425 --> 08:31.803
Jinny, imagine the relief
if we're in that family together.

08:37.142 --> 08:38.644
I happened to bring some dresses.

08:38.644 --> 08:41.730
Lizzy, you would look amazing in green.

08:41.730 --> 08:43.774
Maybe you'll find someone
on your own tonight.

08:43.774 --> 08:46.485
Imagine. Someone all my own.

08:47.611 --> 08:48.529
Mabel.

08:48.529 --> 08:49.738
<i>Pour toi.</i>

08:51.657 --> 08:53.367
- I love it.
- It's gorgeous.

09:07.798 --> 09:12.052
Nan, I have been feeling just awful
since that night. I wanted to--

09:12.052 --> 09:15.264
Does Mother know that you told me?

09:15.264 --> 09:16.765
No, of course not.

09:17.683 --> 09:19.434
She'd be so horrified
about the whole thing.

09:19.434 --> 09:20.769
You have no idea.

09:22.145 --> 09:23.647
God, what was I thinking?

09:23.647 --> 09:26.567
Suddenly it was all just
coming out of my mouth.

09:28.485 --> 09:32.114
Are you apologizing for telling me
or for the 17 years of not telling me?

09:32.906 --> 09:38.412
No, I'm apologizing
for my whole life, probably.

09:39.913 --> 09:42.291
This is coming out wrong, Nan.
I practiced this.

09:42.291 --> 09:44.793
I practiced this for weeks,
but I didn't have you to help me

09:44.793 --> 09:47.129
by thinking of something funny
or smart to say

09:47.129 --> 09:49.631
or always knowing
the right word to choose.

09:50.591 --> 09:52.134
Nan, please say you'll forgive me.

09:52.134 --> 09:53.969
You forgive people. It's what you do.

09:53.969 --> 09:55.220
Well, you don't know me.

09:55.721 --> 09:57.514
I don't know me. I could be anyone.

09:57.514 --> 10:01.351
Hey, you are still Nan.
You're still my sister.

10:01.351 --> 10:03.145
Let me help you, for heaven's sake.

10:07.649 --> 10:11.653
Every time we giggled,
and every time we fought or lay in bed

10:11.653 --> 10:13.947
and threw cookies up in the air,
you had a secret.

10:14.615 --> 10:16.450
And my whole past is a lie.

10:18.619 --> 10:21.663
And I have to tell Conchita.
And I have to tell mother. And I--

10:21.663 --> 10:23.498
No, you mustn't tell anyone.

10:24.166 --> 10:26.001
If anyone knows, if anyone finds out--

10:26.001 --> 10:29.379
You say your past is a lie, Nan,
but your future, I mean, it won't exist.

10:29.379 --> 10:30.839
- Our fu--
- But it's you who cares about that.

10:30.839 --> 10:34.009
You've done this. You've ruined this,
and now you're asking me to what?

10:34.009 --> 10:37.804
Just forget it. Just forget it, Nan.

10:37.804 --> 10:40.641
It's like it never even happened.
I mean, what does it matter?

10:42.726 --> 10:48.190
This isn't a quarrel about a ribbon,
Virginia, or being late to a party.

10:48.190 --> 10:50.025
This is my whole life.

10:51.151 --> 10:52.778
I feel hollow.

10:54.071 --> 10:56.990
I am not the same Nan that I used to be,
and that's just a fact.

10:56.990 --> 11:01.912
And you're only my half-sister,
so maybe you're only half sorry.

11:01.912 --> 11:03.205
Nan.

11:11.755 --> 11:15.259
- Conchie, can we please just talk--
- Nan, don't say I never think of you.

11:15.259 --> 11:17.135
I have invited someone for you tonight.

11:17.135 --> 11:19.513
What? This weekend wasn't
supposed to be about someones.

11:19.513 --> 11:20.430
Nan, come on.

11:20.430 --> 11:22.808
No. Why are you pretending
all this is an accident?

11:22.808 --> 11:24.059
Dick is staying right next door.

11:24.059 --> 11:26.019
And the embarrassing
runaway horse charade.

11:26.019 --> 11:29.481
- I need to talk to you, just you and I.
- Just you and I. Just you and I?

11:29.481 --> 11:31.942
Like when I was giving birth
and terrified and alone.

11:31.942 --> 11:34.987
Shouting for you. Screaming.
And you were on a beach.

11:34.987 --> 11:37.406
I so desperately wanted to stay.
But I really need to talk to you.

11:37.406 --> 11:40.117
- Nan, please just-- No, you listen to me.
- If you could just give me a second--

11:40.117 --> 11:42.578
Any minute now,
you'll be back home in New York,

11:42.578 --> 11:47.749
and I'll be back at that house with those
people and those walls and those silences.

11:48.333 --> 11:51.920
Yes, I planned this weekend.
And England will be horrified, of course.

11:51.920 --> 11:55.090
But that's perfect for England.
They love being horrified.

11:56.008 --> 11:59.052
Everything Dick adored about me,
his family now loathe.

11:59.052 --> 12:01.513
You've seen English girls.

12:01.513 --> 12:05.017
They just nod and obey and do embroidery.

12:05.017 --> 12:08.061
We're like a whole other species.

12:09.104 --> 12:12.107
But I love him, Nan.

12:12.107 --> 12:15.652
I so love my husband.

12:15.652 --> 12:19.823
And if I can't make him love me
the way he used to,

12:19.823 --> 12:22.242
to remember who I am
and not just look at me

12:22.242 --> 12:26.705
with disappointment,
then I shan't survive this.

12:29.958 --> 12:31.418
So, will you help me?

12:35.172 --> 12:37.132
Ever since the baby, I've just been so--

12:38.175 --> 12:42.679
Anyway, I'm-- I need to make tonight work.

12:44.306 --> 12:45.933
Goodness, Nan. Thank you.

12:47.226 --> 12:48.435
Thank you so much.

12:52.397 --> 12:55.442
We must keep our heads up
and our drinks down, mustn't we, darling?

12:55.442 --> 12:56.652
Yes.

12:58.779 --> 13:01.114
Mabel, Lizzy, Jinny.

13:03.200 --> 13:05.869
You look divine, Mabel.

13:05.869 --> 13:08.956
You look beautiful. You all look gorgeous.

13:09.706 --> 13:11.834
Girls, isn't this just like old times?

13:12.543 --> 13:14.795
Don't worry, I'm a married woman now.

13:15.295 --> 13:16.338
And a mother.

13:16.338 --> 13:20.217
So tonight will just be a quiet,
grown-up gathering.

13:20.217 --> 13:22.261
Sophisticated and low-key.

13:24.888 --> 13:25.889
Did you do it?

13:25.889 --> 13:27.891
Look at Jinny, she's got
the whole room in her pocket.

13:31.436 --> 13:35.065
Listen, Dick, even your sister's
having more fun than you...

13:39.611 --> 13:40.612
Come on.

13:43.198 --> 13:44.783
Dick, your wife's got the moves.

13:44.783 --> 13:45.826
I've seen her moves.

13:45.826 --> 13:49.746
Not recently, you haven't.
And I've been working on a new one.

13:50.497 --> 13:53.292
Everybody, look!
Conchita's doing her move!

13:56.837 --> 13:59.339
Look and learn! Be the party!

14:04.136 --> 14:06.555
Please? Fine.

14:07.222 --> 14:08.223
Hello, love.

14:43.759 --> 14:45.636
Are you gonna offer me one of those?

14:46.220 --> 14:47.054
A drink?

14:47.638 --> 14:50.057
Well, I don't know. What else is on offer?

14:51.517 --> 14:56.772
In England, Miss St. George,
we find presumption unappealing.

15:16.667 --> 15:19.086
- You're very beautiful.
- My nose was--

15:19.586 --> 15:22.297
I'm sure you know that
from the admiring glances on every side.

15:24.174 --> 15:25.300
Might I hope for a dance?

16:04.256 --> 16:06.717
It's so hot. Can we go outside?

16:06.717 --> 16:09.428
Darling, go out to the garden.
I'll be there soon.

16:16.435 --> 16:17.644
He actually came.

16:17.644 --> 16:18.729
Who?

16:19.479 --> 16:22.316
The neighbor, Guy Thwarte.

16:22.316 --> 16:25.194
He practically begged for an invitation.

16:59.645 --> 17:04.441
Theodore, Miss Hopeleigh
is interested in nature.

17:09.029 --> 17:10.321
You saw a...

17:11.865 --> 17:14.785
- Didn't you, Jean?
- A hedgehog. I did. Yes.

17:17.454 --> 17:20.749
And was it prickly? Or...

17:20.749 --> 17:23.335
Yes. Very prickly.

17:27.881 --> 17:30.592
Perhaps you might embroider it,
if I know you.

17:34.805 --> 17:37.015
Imagine being a hedgehog on this estate.

17:37.015 --> 17:41.353
Just hedge-hogging around, not realizing
you're in the presence of a duke.

17:50.529 --> 17:51.697
Would you excuse me?

19:10.734 --> 19:14.404
How? How can you be--

19:15.030 --> 19:16.448
Conchita insisted.

19:17.491 --> 19:20.577
Although, I must say, if I'd known
Nan St. George was going to be here,

19:20.577 --> 19:22.246
I'd have worn protective headwear.

19:43.642 --> 19:44.643
Hello.

19:47.729 --> 19:49.147
I just want to see the garden.

19:52.609 --> 19:54.695
Sometimes you just need to breathe,
don't you?

20:12.087 --> 20:13.213
I've missed you.

20:16.049 --> 20:17.217
I've missed us.

20:18.051 --> 20:19.428
Just being near you.

20:21.680 --> 20:22.973
Being able to talk to you.

20:23.974 --> 20:26.852
I know. Ever since Minnie,
we just haven't had the--

20:26.852 --> 20:28.520
Our little girl.

20:29.271 --> 20:31.064
We have a baby.

20:31.064 --> 20:32.649
A baby.

20:43.410 --> 20:45.787
Conchita, let's do your move together,
shall we?

20:46.371 --> 20:48.665
Seadown's hardly noticed me. Please?

20:48.665 --> 20:50.459
Let's do it, the both of us, together.

20:50.459 --> 20:52.836
- Come on. Please. Please, Conchie.
- Darling, you're drunk.

20:52.836 --> 20:54.671
- Okay. Wait.
- Everybody, we're doing the move.

20:54.671 --> 20:56.465
Conchita, we've seen your moves,
sit back down.

20:56.465 --> 20:58.425
We're doing the move.

20:58.425 --> 21:01.345
- Yes.
- Shall we, Conchie?

21:01.345 --> 21:02.387
Yes.

21:03.222 --> 21:04.431
He's still not looking.

21:04.431 --> 21:09.269
Hey, darling, let's get you a drink.
You're still the beautiful one, okay?

21:09.937 --> 21:11.688
Isn't she wonderful?

21:12.689 --> 21:16.401
All right, guys. It's time. Sardines.

21:19.613 --> 21:23.242
Mabel! Mabel! Mabel!

21:23.242 --> 21:25.619
It's time! Sardines!
You're the best at hiding.

21:25.619 --> 21:27.621
You hide first! Come on!

21:28.830 --> 21:31.041
Okay. Let's go.

21:34.962 --> 21:35.963
Has anything--

21:37.798 --> 21:39.925
Since I last saw you,
has anything happened?

21:41.510 --> 21:42.511
What do you mean?

21:43.011 --> 21:45.556
You seem more still.

21:48.058 --> 21:49.685
You're the first to notice.

21:57.985 --> 22:00.946
How are you?
With your mother and everything?

22:02.239 --> 22:04.616
I'm sorry, there is no "and everything."
How are you?

22:06.159 --> 22:07.828
Everybody just goes on with life.

22:09.580 --> 22:12.541
It's hard to accept them laughing
and smiling, isn't it?

22:12.541 --> 22:13.625
Yeah.

22:14.626 --> 22:16.753
And sometimes the thought of everyone

22:16.753 --> 22:19.548
dancing and joking and talking about

22:20.465 --> 22:21.508
cheese or whatever--

22:24.887 --> 22:26.555
I do like cheese.

22:28.182 --> 22:29.933
I mean, obviously that's a bad example,
but--

22:29.933 --> 22:31.018
Yes. Good.

22:34.188 --> 22:37.065
Your mother suddenly
not being there though, it is--

22:38.817 --> 22:40.194
Sometimes the memory bubbles up.

22:41.320 --> 22:42.905
Not having a mother, it's--

22:44.740 --> 22:45.741
Yeah.

22:53.373 --> 22:55.042
- Don't come in.
- Jinny?

22:57.169 --> 22:58.170
You didn't lock it.

22:58.170 --> 23:00.964
Yeah, well, would it stop you if I had?

23:10.599 --> 23:13.644
Are you-- About Seadown and everything?

23:13.644 --> 23:14.811
It's fine.

23:16.146 --> 23:19.816
Only, he asked me to dance. He asked me.

23:19.816 --> 23:21.902
And I would never
if I thought that you and him were--

23:21.902 --> 23:23.529
Of course not. It's fine.

23:23.529 --> 23:26.240
Because that comes first to me,
of course, our friendship.

23:26.240 --> 23:28.367
Look, we're not engaged.
I'm not engaged to him,

23:28.367 --> 23:30.827
as my mother reminds me
every four minutes.

23:35.123 --> 23:39.169
The thing is, we don't know, do we?

23:40.379 --> 23:41.922
We never know.

23:44.383 --> 23:46.134
Jinny, what if this is our love story?

23:48.595 --> 23:49.763
Mine and his.

23:51.306 --> 23:53.058
Well, it's up to Seadown, isn't it?

23:54.142 --> 23:56.770
In England,
they find presumption unappealing,

23:56.770 --> 23:59.189
so he'll decide.

23:59.189 --> 24:04.236
And I guess it depends whether
he's interested in beauty and charm or...

24:05.320 --> 24:07.197
Or what?

24:10.409 --> 24:12.119
Well, whatever it is you're offering.

24:12.119 --> 24:15.497
Girls! Sardines! Where are you?

24:15.497 --> 24:16.874
We're all looking for Mabel.

24:16.874 --> 24:19.001
Girls! The games are starting.

24:31.471 --> 24:34.099
Mabel, we're coming.

25:00.626 --> 25:01.877
- Come on.
- Downstairs.

25:04.087 --> 25:06.173
Lizzy!
Where's that naughty sister of yours?

25:06.173 --> 25:07.257
Can't you control her?

25:07.257 --> 25:09.092
Mabel's the queen of hiding in corners.

25:09.092 --> 25:10.552
Where did she go? Upstairs?

25:11.386 --> 25:12.387
Hello.

25:13.055 --> 25:14.598
I've been pretending
to look for your sister.

25:15.098 --> 25:16.099
Have you?

25:16.600 --> 25:18.393
I'm afraid
I've really been looking for you.

25:20.312 --> 25:22.272
Well, maybe we should look together.

25:36.662 --> 25:38.455
I like the stillness too, you know.

25:39.373 --> 25:41.208
We've established, I hope,

25:41.917 --> 25:44.169
that I'm a big fan of
the dropping-shoes-in-cakes

25:44.169 --> 25:47.256
and climbing out of buildings
and the rest of it. Big fan.

25:48.215 --> 25:53.178
But just strolling
and being still is also...

25:56.014 --> 25:58.058
I haven't climbed any buildings lately.

26:23.083 --> 26:26.086
Does this look like
the sort of place Mabel might hide?

26:26.086 --> 26:27.629
Well, perhaps we ought to check.

26:37.890 --> 26:38.932
Nothing.

26:42.227 --> 26:43.562
Do you wanna close the door?

27:04.333 --> 27:05.626
You found me.

27:08.629 --> 27:11.048
Sit over there.

27:22.434 --> 27:24.728
- Do you wanna to sit here?
- Take off your dress.

27:33.237 --> 27:34.947
It's not actually even my dress.

27:34.947 --> 27:37.032
- We didn't know anybody else would be--
- Do you want to?

27:40.827 --> 27:41.828
Take it off.

27:44.206 --> 27:45.207
Take it off.

27:53.131 --> 27:54.132
Slower.

27:59.930 --> 28:02.224
I feel like you speak
a different language,

28:02.224 --> 28:03.725
Conchita and the rest of you.

28:05.227 --> 28:06.687
Loud.

28:07.855 --> 28:09.690
That's Conchita's language.

28:11.233 --> 28:12.734
It's like she's fearless.

28:13.902 --> 28:15.237
She's magnificent.

28:18.740 --> 28:19.950
Do you loathe her?

28:22.202 --> 28:23.203
No.

28:24.705 --> 28:27.249
But I don't think she understands
somebody choosing to be alone

28:27.249 --> 28:29.543
any more than she understands
what a lord is.

28:30.711 --> 28:31.795
Richard?

28:33.630 --> 28:35.465
Well, he's just a man.

28:37.384 --> 28:39.887
Conchita's herself.

28:43.015 --> 28:45.392
Extraordinary to know
what that even means.

28:48.145 --> 28:50.939
I think one day you just figure it out.

29:11.335 --> 29:12.711
Was that your sister?

29:12.711 --> 29:15.172
She's too busy
fighting Jinny over your brother.

29:16.131 --> 29:17.341
What? Seadown?

29:18.258 --> 29:19.551
They don't know him.

29:20.177 --> 29:22.262
Well, I hear he's an enigma.

29:25.432 --> 29:26.725
He's a monster.

29:47.287 --> 29:48.830
Don't move a muscle.

30:05.806 --> 30:07.850
London was over for me
when you went to Cornwall.

30:13.480 --> 30:14.773
Was it?

30:15.315 --> 30:16.567
Completely.

30:17.192 --> 30:21.405
It was irrelevant since the person
I wanted to share it with was gone.

30:24.032 --> 30:26.577
Well, that person from before,
from the ball, and so on,

30:26.577 --> 30:28.078
she might actually be gone.

30:29.913 --> 30:31.540
Hello. What are you--

30:31.540 --> 30:34.126
- Watch out. Hide.
- I was looking for you.

30:34.126 --> 30:35.836
What are you playing at, Laura?

30:35.836 --> 30:38.547
It's a chaperone's job not to play.

30:45.470 --> 30:46.805
What are you doing?

30:46.805 --> 30:48.473
You told me to hide.

30:51.810 --> 30:53.604
Are you waving at someone?

30:56.648 --> 30:57.816
- No, this?
- Yes.

30:57.816 --> 30:59.109
This is casual.

30:59.109 --> 31:00.903
This is how I stand when I'm casual.

31:00.903 --> 31:02.696
You're breezy.

31:05.199 --> 31:07.075
Do you want some help?

31:07.075 --> 31:08.535
Yes, please.

31:14.625 --> 31:15.626
I'm sorry.

31:17.878 --> 31:18.879
Why?

31:19.922 --> 31:22.925
You just make me want to apologize.

31:24.426 --> 31:27.554
For having your arm stuck on a trellis?

31:33.393 --> 31:37.814
Nan, I've never met anyone
I find it so easy to be honest with.

31:39.858 --> 31:41.276
Isn't that strange?

32:08.470 --> 32:09.763
Shall we go to bed?

32:11.139 --> 32:13.183
Maybe we can do better than that.

32:13.183 --> 32:15.686
- What's better than bed?
- Come and see.

32:31.869 --> 32:33.370
What is it, Nan?

32:34.997 --> 32:38.417
Just Jinny blurted something out and...

32:40.210 --> 32:43.505
It's all just been too enormous,

32:43.505 --> 32:45.048
and I just don't know what do with it all.

32:46.258 --> 32:47.259
Might I help?

32:49.928 --> 32:51.096
No, nobody can.

32:52.806 --> 32:54.641
And Jinny said I mustn't tell anyone.

32:56.268 --> 32:58.270
Anyone I tell will think less of me.

33:00.397 --> 33:03.609
Well,
I think I've made it very clear already

33:03.609 --> 33:05.736
that my opinion of you
is really very high.

33:08.322 --> 33:10.908
Also, I have a little experience
of the world thinking badly of me.

33:13.744 --> 33:14.745
Do you?

33:15.579 --> 33:19.958
We've all done things we're not proud of.

33:22.002 --> 33:24.213
My mother isn't my mother.

33:27.466 --> 33:30.219
It's all ridiculous.

33:30.219 --> 33:32.971
The fact is that
I am not who I thought I was.

33:38.477 --> 33:39.478
Mother...

33:43.357 --> 33:47.444
Mrs. St. George, she forgave my daddy,

33:47.444 --> 33:50.113
out loud at least, as she always does,
and she took me in.

33:51.406 --> 33:52.866
But I don't know the full story.

33:52.866 --> 33:55.077
Jinny just let it out,
and she's known this entire time.

33:55.077 --> 33:56.620
They've all known this entire time.

33:59.164 --> 34:00.666
That's almost the worst part of it.

34:02.334 --> 34:06.713
The lying. The conspiring to lie.
The whole lot of them.

34:06.713 --> 34:09.341
So, your birth wasn't--

34:09.341 --> 34:11.134
Your mother and father weren't--

34:11.134 --> 34:13.387
And people will judge
because that's just what they do.

34:13.387 --> 34:14.388
But it's the secrets.

34:14.388 --> 34:18.684
It's the whole life's worth of them.

34:20.686 --> 34:23.856
I remember there was this girl
back in Saratoga,

34:23.856 --> 34:25.524
and her name was Amy Fairchild,

34:25.524 --> 34:29.069
and she was born out of wedlock,

34:29.069 --> 34:32.572
and so the names that she got called.

34:32.572 --> 34:34.741
But it was also
partly because of her hair,

34:34.741 --> 34:36.743
which was all over the place,
and it wasn't helping her.

34:36.743 --> 34:40.121
But there was just this face that people
pulled when her name was mentioned.

34:40.121 --> 34:41.540
And at parties, she would sit at the side

34:41.540 --> 34:43.708
and there was a circle around her
that no one would step into

34:43.708 --> 34:46.378
because we all knew
what her life would end up being.

34:46.378 --> 34:48.130
And she would never be normal
because how could she?

34:48.130 --> 34:51.049
And now that's just-- And now that's me.

34:51.049 --> 34:53.969
I am Amy Fairchild,

34:53.969 --> 34:57.472
and some days
I can't be bothered with my hair,

34:57.472 --> 35:00.601
but other days, I can spend hours at it.

35:00.601 --> 35:02.352
But we're just all different, aren't we?

35:06.815 --> 35:09.985
I am so sorry. I shouldn't have just--
S-- I'm--

35:09.985 --> 35:12.070
- I didn't want you to feel that I was--
- Of course not.

35:12.070 --> 35:14.656
It's fine.

35:19.119 --> 35:21.455
- Should we just--
- Yes, it's getting late.

35:21.455 --> 35:24.041
I should probably go. Yeah. I think we--

35:26.335 --> 35:27.669
I think we should.

35:36.720 --> 35:38.847
Lord Seadown has gone to bed.

35:38.847 --> 35:41.558
He asked me to tell you
he'll see you at breakfast.

36:26.979 --> 36:28.647
You've been practicing your moves.

36:35.654 --> 36:37.823
Finally,
England's what I hoped it would be.

37:12.816 --> 37:14.902
I don't wanna be Amy Fairchild.

37:20.741 --> 37:21.742
Then don't.

37:25.245 --> 37:27.372
Though you did bring a hairbrush,
didn't you?

37:28.290 --> 37:30.334
It's looking a little...

37:33.587 --> 37:35.047
Oh, Nan.

37:36.507 --> 37:41.929
We know together now, at least,
and I am entirely sorry.

37:42.721 --> 37:45.891
I'm not just half sorry. I am fully sorry.

37:45.891 --> 37:48.852
I'm blue with it.

37:49.394 --> 37:50.395
Don't be blue...

37:53.357 --> 37:55.234
it'll clash with your dress.

38:03.992 --> 38:05.869
Who was it if it wasn't Mother?

38:08.330 --> 38:09.331
I don't know.

38:10.207 --> 38:11.208
No, really.

38:13.168 --> 38:15.462
There was a letter.

38:16.922 --> 38:19.383
I was looking in Daddy's desk
for barley sugar,

38:19.383 --> 38:22.511
but I just read bits of it.
I didn't see a name.

38:22.511 --> 38:25.472
Just insults for Daddy and...

38:28.183 --> 38:30.853
arrangements for the money
that changed hands.

38:32.604 --> 38:33.605
They bought me?

38:37.317 --> 38:40.112
Yeah, well, Mother near exploded
when she found me looking at it.

38:41.154 --> 38:45.158
Nan, I mean it,
if you talk to her, she'll--

38:45.158 --> 38:46.994
- I mean, she'll--
- I won't.

38:49.162 --> 38:53.625
Let's just close the box, all right? Yes?

38:53.625 --> 38:58.714
Just not tell a soul,
and it'll be just like before.

39:02.593 --> 39:05.846
Oh, Nan. I'm sorry.

39:54.686 --> 39:56.396
- Morning.
- Morning.

39:56.396 --> 39:57.481
Morning.

40:12.621 --> 40:14.581
Nothing's real when you're away from home.

40:16.041 --> 40:20.504
I knew it. I knew it, is the awful truth.

40:21.213 --> 40:23.507
Before the wedding, I suspected
I would spend the rest of my life

40:23.507 --> 40:24.925
apologizing for Conchita,

40:24.925 --> 40:26.677
and I should've listened to my gut.

40:26.677 --> 40:29.638
I think the fact is,
there are women and there are wives.

40:30.389 --> 40:34.309
And New York was amazing,
of course it was, but it was pretending.

40:34.309 --> 40:37.646
It was just like this is, pretending.
Pretending every day.

40:37.646 --> 40:42.693
And in real life,
I just think Mother's right.

40:43.819 --> 40:45.320
Conchita just doesn't fit.

40:47.573 --> 40:48.574
And she never will.

41:03.589 --> 41:05.007
But she's like an addiction.

41:07.301 --> 41:09.761
And I'll love her my whole life.
I'll never stop.

41:13.140 --> 41:15.475
I mean, how could I?
Anymore than I could stop breathing.

41:22.357 --> 41:23.400
Nan, darling.

41:25.235 --> 41:26.445
Last night...

41:28.488 --> 41:30.449
were you watching Dick's face
as I was dancing?

41:32.284 --> 41:34.036
He did love it, didn't he?

41:36.371 --> 41:37.289
What's wrong?

41:39.791 --> 41:42.503
I'm not the kind of wife
that needs him to notice my new gloves.

41:42.503 --> 41:43.587
Of course not.

41:43.587 --> 41:46.381
Or sit adoringly watching me sleep.

41:47.508 --> 41:50.010
But I do watch my baby as she sleeps.

41:54.348 --> 41:55.349
God.

41:56.350 --> 41:58.977
Nan, ever since she was born,
I've been such a mess.

42:00.145 --> 42:03.315
You know, she needs me,
and they won't even let me be with her.

42:04.816 --> 42:07.361
And also, everything hurts,
and I just feel so--

42:07.361 --> 42:08.445
Have you talked to Dick?

42:08.445 --> 42:11.532
Oh, Go--
I want him to desire me, not pity me.

42:11.532 --> 42:16.537
Certainly not the absolute worst,
be ashamed of me.

42:20.582 --> 42:23.085
I would have never gone to Cornwall
if they hadn't made me.

42:24.503 --> 42:27.840
I know, Nan. Okay? I know.

42:31.426 --> 42:33.637
I just need a new plan, and that's that.

42:34.179 --> 42:38.267
Till then, I shall be all smiles.
He mustn't see he's breaking me.

42:40.894 --> 42:42.187
Listen, Nan,

42:42.187 --> 42:46.358
when you start looking for someone,
if that day ever comes,

42:47.734 --> 42:50.237
try to find someone
who doesn't want you to pretend.

42:52.155 --> 42:54.533
Someone I can trust
and tell my secrets to.

42:56.285 --> 42:57.536
Who listens.

42:58.036 --> 43:00.122
And someone who understands
what I need to hear.

43:01.206 --> 43:02.499
Darling Nan, I do love you,

43:02.499 --> 43:05.752
but I think you might have to lower
your expectations.

43:06.712 --> 43:08.005
Just a tiny bit.

43:10.757 --> 43:12.050
Hey, can we talk?

43:14.011 --> 43:16.263
Look, it's all right. It's fine.

43:16.263 --> 43:17.598
No, but it's not what--

43:17.598 --> 43:19.600
Listen, it doesn't matter. Really.

43:20.350 --> 43:23.353
- Of course he'd choose you.
- He didn't, though.

43:23.353 --> 43:26.732
Nothing happened.

43:26.732 --> 43:30.068
It's never gonna be anything more than--

43:30.068 --> 43:31.153
Look, it's over.

43:37.201 --> 43:38.869
- That was shocking.
- Not bad.

43:40.162 --> 43:43.582
Champagne. It's 11:00 a.m.,
we've waited long enough.

43:43.582 --> 43:45.167
- Yes, we have.
- Well done.

43:53.634 --> 43:54.843
It went early!

43:55.761 --> 43:57.387
Did you see that, Dick?

43:57.387 --> 44:00.516
Yeah, I'm afraid my husband
doesn't know how to satisfy me

44:01.517 --> 44:03.393
when it comes to my morning champagne.

44:19.117 --> 44:20.285
Miss St. George.

44:22.371 --> 44:23.372
May I?

44:33.173 --> 44:35.425
I've enjoyed, Miss St. George,

44:36.677 --> 44:39.221
the opportunity of making
your acquaintance these past weeks.

44:40.556 --> 44:44.184
I've long waited to meet someone who
might put me in a marrying frame of mind.

44:48.522 --> 44:49.523
Might you--

44:53.527 --> 44:54.945
Might you agree to be my wife?

44:56.780 --> 44:58.824
- Do you mean it?
- I mean it entirely.

44:58.824 --> 45:01.118
- Then yes.
- Yes?

45:01.118 --> 45:03.287
I agree. I quite agree.

45:08.000 --> 45:09.168
It's fine.

45:12.337 --> 45:15.090
You will ask me again
when Mother's nearby to hear, won't you?

45:16.633 --> 45:17.759
Nan.

45:18.719 --> 45:19.720
Congratulations.

45:19.720 --> 45:20.762
Surprise.

45:20.762 --> 45:22.514
Nan, I'm getting married!

45:25.809 --> 45:27.519
- Conchita.
- Congratulations!

45:27.519 --> 45:29.521
- We're gonna be wives.
- Oh, my God.

45:30.439 --> 45:31.356
Jinny.

45:37.613 --> 45:42.659
I am so glad that you are back to yourself
after last night's silliness.

45:44.578 --> 45:46.788
Yeah. Back to normal.

45:46.788 --> 45:48.665
- Can you believe it?
- Good.

45:48.665 --> 45:50.083
I told you...

45:50.083 --> 45:51.168
Champagne.

45:56.840 --> 46:00.385
And I'll have a sister-in-law.
Jinny and I will be sisters.

47:00.946 --> 47:02.656
- I hope you don't think--
- Are you sure you--

47:05.576 --> 47:06.994
Congratulations, Jinny.

47:07.578 --> 47:09.162
A lord.

47:10.831 --> 47:12.124
- I'm sorry that I--
- No...

47:14.918 --> 47:15.919
I am.

47:16.753 --> 47:17.754
I'm sorry.

47:22.176 --> 47:23.177
But listen.

47:25.137 --> 47:28.849
After everything, I wonder if Seadown--

47:30.017 --> 47:31.101
I mean, I wonder if--

47:32.186 --> 47:34.897
When you're imagining
how it might be to be married to him.

47:34.897 --> 47:36.773
Well, I shall marry him and report back.

47:37.274 --> 47:38.275
Right.

47:46.491 --> 47:47.576
Are you sure?

47:48.785 --> 47:49.912
You're really sure?

47:52.206 --> 47:53.999
- Nothing happened last night.
- Nothing happened.

47:53.999 --> 47:55.042
That's what you said.

47:56.668 --> 47:57.669
I just--

47:59.296 --> 48:03.717
I would so hate for you
to be disappointed.

48:07.262 --> 48:08.847
Don't spoil it for me, Lizzy.

48:10.182 --> 48:13.310
After all this time,
it's usually Nan overshadowing things,

48:13.810 --> 48:15.437
but she's been quite wonderful, in fact.

48:17.648 --> 48:19.525
Can't you just be pleased for me?

48:21.318 --> 48:22.319
At least for today?

48:53.934 --> 48:54.935
Theo.

48:56.812 --> 48:57.646
Hello there.

48:59.356 --> 49:01.149
Hello. What are you doing here?

49:02.484 --> 49:04.278
This is very unlike me indeed.

49:05.112 --> 49:07.072
I tracked you down
all the way from Cornwall.

49:07.614 --> 49:09.867
- Meet me at the gate.
- Okay.

49:16.915 --> 49:19.793
Sir, madam, you have to come.

49:20.377 --> 49:22.713
The Duke of Tintagel's carriage
is on the drive.

49:22.713 --> 49:24.715
The Duke? What's he doing here?

49:24.715 --> 49:25.799
Poor Jinny.

49:25.799 --> 49:28.093
He turns up just as she's off the shelf.

49:28.093 --> 49:30.929
- Quick, let's go.
- Let's go.

49:30.929 --> 49:32.931
Why would the Duke be coming to Runnymede?

49:33.432 --> 49:34.266
Where's Nan?

49:35.809 --> 49:38.812
- Oh, my God.
- Come on, Conchita.

49:39.313 --> 49:41.857
- How are you, actually?
- I'm well. Much better now.

49:42.357 --> 49:44.026
- I struggled to find you at first.
- Yes.

49:45.194 --> 49:46.195
Where have you been?

49:46.195 --> 49:49.948
Just there.

49:49.948 --> 49:52.201
At my friend's endless party.

49:53.619 --> 49:56.496
And if they were here with us now,
your friends,

49:57.831 --> 49:59.249
who would you tell them I was?

50:03.003 --> 50:07.633
Well, just an artist friend of mine
who likes skulking round hedges.

50:08.884 --> 50:11.053
You'd be within your rights
to have me arrested.

50:11.595 --> 50:13.013
Perhaps, but I am--

50:15.474 --> 50:17.643
I'm impossibly pleased to see you.

50:18.435 --> 50:19.895
So, let's just go for a walk first,

50:19.895 --> 50:22.981
and then maybe I'll call
the authorities afterwards.

50:25.025 --> 50:27.152
Nan, I need to-- Please--

50:29.029 --> 50:33.200
You said you wished
you could stay in Cornwall forever.

50:34.201 --> 50:35.035
I did.

50:35.035 --> 50:37.496
- And you're not interested in fuss?
- Not one bit.

50:38.330 --> 50:39.831
Which is very unusual, I find.

50:40.749 --> 50:45.337
Girls I generally meet don't think
or talk so freely or so passionately.

50:47.589 --> 50:50.008
And they wouldn't care for me
being just an artist.

50:50.008 --> 50:51.969
- Particularly a bad one.
- You're a wonderful artist.

50:51.969 --> 50:53.053
The fact is, I--

50:54.263 --> 50:56.765
I must speak,
before everyone comes and it's all ruined.

50:57.683 --> 51:00.102
I could pretend I was just passing today

51:00.102 --> 51:03.939
or had some kind of garden fascination.

51:05.566 --> 51:09.152
But the truth is,
I set off from Tintagel at first light

51:09.152 --> 51:10.904
with a quite deliberate intention.

51:15.033 --> 51:16.493
This is ridiculous, of course.

51:16.493 --> 51:18.829
And I apologize,
the speed of it and everything.

51:20.706 --> 51:21.707
But I have to.

51:22.791 --> 51:24.251
It feels essential.

51:27.713 --> 51:31.175
I think you're extraordinary. Truly.

51:32.509 --> 51:37.639
And on the beach, the two of us had this--

51:40.184 --> 51:42.060
Well,
it felt perhaps like you felt it too.

51:43.854 --> 51:44.855
Maybe.

51:46.064 --> 51:49.943
And if we agreed
that we might always swim in the sea,

51:51.028 --> 51:52.654
hiding from life's nonsense,

51:54.406 --> 51:56.200
not caring what anyone else thinks...

52:06.835 --> 52:09.213
Might you do me the honor
of being my wife?
