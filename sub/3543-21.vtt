00:00.421 --> 00:01.722
Previously on
"The Vampire Diaries"...

00:01.722 --> 00:03.160
I can't.
I can't. I can't.

00:03.161 --> 00:04.654
Turn it off.

00:04.655 --> 00:07.034
She's ruthless
without her humanity, Damon.

00:07.035 --> 00:09.286
When Silas was buried
by the witch Qetsiyah,

00:09.287 --> 00:11.021
she left him with the cure.

00:11.022 --> 00:14.091
She knew that he wanted to die,
be reunited with his one true love.

00:14.092 --> 00:16.059
Bonnie is the one
that can drop the veil

00:16.059 --> 00:17.561
between this side
and the other side.

00:17.562 --> 00:18.795
You will
open the floodgates

00:18.796 --> 00:21.014
for every supernatural being
that has ever died.

00:21.015 --> 00:23.784
Silas,
show me your real face.

00:23.785 --> 00:25.402
Now, why would I do that

00:25.403 --> 00:27.271
when I can look like
whomever I want you to see?

00:27.272 --> 00:28.856
So what are we gonna do?

00:28.857 --> 00:30.741
Lock her up, make
her life a living hell.

00:30.742 --> 00:32.607
You boys want to play games?

00:33.203 --> 00:35.311
Let's see who breaks first.

00:43.253 --> 00:46.924
Elena, you're here.
Hey, I got valedictorian.

00:46.925 --> 00:48.425
You can help me write my speech.

00:48.426 --> 00:50.127
- Pass.
- Oh, come on.

00:50.128 --> 00:52.463
We're graduating
this year. This is it.

00:52.464 --> 00:54.548
We're gonna have to soak up
every second before...

00:54.549 --> 00:59.336
Wait. Something is not right.
I don't want to be here.

00:59.337 --> 01:00.837
What is wrong with you?

01:00.838 --> 01:02.473
Don't you want to be
with your friends,

01:02.474 --> 01:06.360
graduation parties, caps, gowns?
You know the drill.

01:06.361 --> 01:08.512
What is this?

01:08.513 --> 01:11.481
We're not really here, are we?

01:12.682 --> 01:14.518
- We're in my head.
- Relax.

01:14.519 --> 01:16.320
I just want to show you
all the things

01:16.321 --> 01:17.955
you've been missing out
on since you took

01:17.956 --> 01:20.857
the giant leap
over the cuckoo's nest.

01:20.858 --> 01:22.376
Last thing I remember...

01:22.377 --> 01:25.162
Let me guess. Prom...
Beautiful dress,

01:25.163 --> 01:27.881
gorgeous hair,
you trying to murder Bonnie.

01:27.882 --> 01:29.166
It's a good thing I was
there to take care of you.

01:29.167 --> 01:31.552
- You starved me, you and Stefan.
- Yeah. Well,

01:31.553 --> 01:33.504
we had to keep you weak
so I could bring you here.

01:33.505 --> 01:35.472
See, the way I figure it is,
if I can make you nostalgic,

01:35.473 --> 01:38.225
then you're already halfway
to getting your humanity back.

01:38.226 --> 01:40.510
It's not gonna work, Damon.

01:42.179 --> 01:44.898
Well, there are
other ways to provoke

01:44.899 --> 01:46.933
an emotional response.

01:49.186 --> 01:52.739
You still have
her locked in the safe?

01:52.740 --> 01:54.858
You've been in her head
for an hour.

01:54.859 --> 01:56.526
What, still nothing?

01:58.028 --> 02:00.279
How you doing in there?

02:03.016 --> 02:05.368
Come on.

02:09.590 --> 02:12.742
Is the old you ready
to come out and play?

02:12.743 --> 02:15.211
Go to hell.

02:16.597 --> 02:19.748
Ok.
Back you go.

02:27.511 --> 02:31.595
We can do this the nice way,
or we can do it the other way,

02:31.596 --> 02:34.031
but either way, we're not stopping

02:34.032 --> 02:37.050
until you turn your
humanity switch back on.

02:37.051 --> 02:39.069
So I'm gonna let you
think about that,

02:39.070 --> 02:42.706
and I'm gonna come back for you
in a couple hours or a couple years

02:42.707 --> 02:45.441
because all we have is time.

02:52.403 --> 02:54.384
Where is she?
I want to see her.

02:54.385 --> 02:57.254
We're not letting anyone see her.
That's the whole point.

02:57.255 --> 02:59.056
Isolation leads to
misery, leads to emotion.

02:59.057 --> 03:01.725
She's been here for days.
She hasn't improved at all?

03:01.726 --> 03:04.595
Look. She doesn't want to,
Caroline, not yet, all right?

03:04.596 --> 03:06.096
She's devastated.
She lost her brother.

03:06.097 --> 03:08.465
She attacked her friends.
She killed an innocent woman.

03:08.466 --> 03:09.732
You said that you knew
how to help her.

03:09.943 --> 03:12.653
- I did say that. We are.
- How, by torturing her?

03:12.654 --> 03:14.821
It's not torture.
It's an intervention.

03:14.822 --> 03:16.607
The only chance we have with her

03:16.608 --> 03:18.442
is to provoke her,
to trigger something...

03:18.443 --> 03:21.942
Fear, anger, self-pity, anything.

03:23.313 --> 03:25.315
Let me talk to her

03:25.316 --> 03:27.451
before any more interventioning.

03:27.452 --> 03:28.869
If she's weak, she can't hurt me.

03:28.870 --> 03:33.839
Please just let me try.

03:39.796 --> 03:43.332
Good luck.

03:45.000 --> 03:51.074
Advertise your product or brand here
contact www.OpenSubtitles.org today

03:53.510 --> 03:55.862
I brought you something.

03:55.863 --> 03:59.316
It doesn't have any
vervain in it, I swear.

03:59.317 --> 04:03.519
I just figured a little blood
might help you think straight.

04:08.024 --> 04:11.679
For the record, I don't agree
with what they're doing.

04:11.680 --> 04:14.932
I mean, I agree that you need
to turn your humanity back on,

04:14.933 --> 04:18.668
but I don't think
that making you suffer

04:18.670 --> 04:20.370
is the way to do it.

04:20.370 --> 04:22.506
That's not who you are.

04:22.507 --> 04:26.009
What makes you such
an expert on who I am?

04:26.010 --> 04:28.478
Because we've been friends forever.

04:28.479 --> 04:30.681
I tried to kill you, Caroline.

04:30.682 --> 04:33.767
I'm not exactly BFF
material anymore.

04:33.768 --> 04:35.234
You should move on.

04:38.355 --> 04:41.408
I am not going to give up on you.

04:41.409 --> 04:47.408
This annoying, clingy
thing that you're doing,

04:47.665 --> 04:49.399
did it ever occur to you
maybe that's why

04:49.400 --> 04:51.201
both your boyfriends skipped town?

04:51.202 --> 04:55.405
I mean, I know that Tyler said
he was running for his life.

04:55.406 --> 04:58.341
Maybe he was running from you.

04:58.342 --> 05:01.378
And Klaus...
I mean,

05:01.379 --> 05:02.512
let's just say it.

05:02.513 --> 05:04.047
Nobody likes a tease.

05:04.048 --> 05:06.249
Hey, I'm not judging.

05:06.250 --> 05:09.936
Might be nice to have a bad boy
ruffle those perfect feathers.

05:09.937 --> 05:11.938
You're in pain.
You're lashing out.

05:11.939 --> 05:15.275
I get it, but you can't
stay this way forever.

05:15.276 --> 05:17.594
We're about to graduate
and start new lives,

05:17.595 --> 05:18.779
and you deserve...

05:18.780 --> 05:21.198
Are you seriously talking
about High-School graduation?

05:21.199 --> 05:25.952
Caroline, do you realize
how pathetic you're gonna look

05:25.953 --> 05:28.288
in that cap and gown
pretending to be human

05:28.289 --> 05:30.440
while your mom fake-smiles

05:30.441 --> 05:34.377
and just counts down the minutes
until you leave town

05:34.378 --> 05:35.945
so that you can stop
being a reminder

05:35.946 --> 05:39.049
that her daughter is a repulsive,

05:39.050 --> 05:42.618
blood-sucking,
control freak monster?

05:45.138 --> 05:47.591
It's really too bad
Stefan stopped me

05:47.592 --> 05:49.226
before I put you out
of your misery,

05:49.227 --> 05:54.263
but, hey, here's to second chances.

05:57.184 --> 05:58.467
Elena?

06:06.443 --> 06:08.505
Do whatever you have to do.

06:09.780 --> 06:11.714
I'm gonna be upstairs.

06:26.847 --> 06:28.297
Ahh...

06:30.016 --> 06:33.670
I was wondering if you were gonna
say hello or keep ignoring me.

06:33.671 --> 06:35.505
I was working.

06:35.506 --> 06:38.007
I see you compelled
the bartenders again.

06:38.008 --> 06:39.192
I'm celebrating.

06:39.193 --> 06:42.646
My brothers and I
have parted company.

06:42.647 --> 06:45.649
Elijah and Nik have
run off to New Orleans

06:45.650 --> 06:48.518
chasing God knows what,
and I am finally free.

06:48.519 --> 06:49.953
Yeah. I heard about that.

06:49.954 --> 06:52.072
Did you hear that I
lost the cure to Silas?

06:52.073 --> 06:55.542
I was this close
to the life that I always wanted,

06:55.543 --> 06:59.462
and then, poof,
gone in a heartbeat.

06:59.463 --> 07:02.704
I'm sorry. I know
how much you wanted it.

07:02.705 --> 07:05.502
Please. I know you were planning
on stealing it for Elena.

07:06.615 --> 07:10.307
- I never had a chance, did I?
- I meant what I said,

07:10.308 --> 07:12.208
but if you want to feel
sorry for yourself,

07:12.209 --> 07:13.510
go ahead.

07:13.511 --> 07:15.812
- Why don't you stay and have a drink?
- I can't.

07:15.813 --> 07:17.013
I've got to go meet Caroline.

07:17.014 --> 07:19.533
Are they still keeping
Elena trapped

07:19.534 --> 07:21.568
in the Salvatore mansion?

07:21.569 --> 07:24.070
I happen to like her
just the way she is.

07:24.071 --> 07:28.525
It's tragic that they're
trying so desperately

07:28.526 --> 07:30.526
to fix something that isn't broken.

07:31.813 --> 07:33.697
Elena was my friend

07:33.698 --> 07:36.199
long before she was
your mean-girl sidekick.

07:36.200 --> 07:38.940
So if you're upset
that you lost the cure

07:38.941 --> 07:41.587
and your brothers ditched you,
why are you still in Mystic Falls?

07:42.720 --> 07:44.124
Some of us don't have
the option of leaving.

07:44.125 --> 07:47.577
Some of us are broke
and failing all of our classes

07:47.578 --> 07:49.578
and stuck here.

07:50.504 --> 07:52.881
So why don't you take your freedom
and get the hell out of town?

07:54.084 --> 07:55.551
I would.

07:58.355 --> 07:59.923
Bonnie,
where have you been?

07:59.924 --> 08:01.758
I left you, like,
90 million messages.

08:01.759 --> 08:03.260
Studying French.

08:03.261 --> 08:05.094
We still have
final exams, remember?

08:05.095 --> 08:07.113
Oh, don't remind me. Look.

08:07.114 --> 08:10.166
This whole thing with Elena,
it's about to get brutal,

08:10.167 --> 08:12.270
and I know that she's
not your favorite person right now,

08:12.271 --> 08:14.554
but I could really
use you over here.

08:14.555 --> 08:17.230
For what, moral support or
so you can check up on me?

08:17.231 --> 08:20.744
Moral support
and maybe just a tiny check-in

08:20.745 --> 08:23.107
to make sure that
Silas isn't playing

08:23.108 --> 08:25.782
any more pesky
little mind games with you.

08:25.783 --> 08:27.133
I'm fine, ok?

08:27.134 --> 08:29.052
Silas doesn't control me anymore.

08:29.053 --> 08:30.419
And I think I'll pass
on the invite.

08:31.518 --> 08:32.972
Elena tried to kill me.

08:32.974 --> 08:35.592
I'm not quite ready
to forgive and forget.

08:35.592 --> 08:37.260
I'm gonna call you later, ok?

08:37.260 --> 08:39.094
I got to go.

08:40.981 --> 08:44.942
Lying, scheming,
and a secret rendezvous with moi?

08:44.943 --> 08:46.853
Not very Bonnie Bennett-y,

08:46.854 --> 08:48.772
especially when Elena
needs her favorite witch.

08:48.773 --> 08:51.808
This has nothing to do with them.
This is between you and me.

08:51.809 --> 08:53.610
All right. Well, luckily for you,

08:53.611 --> 08:56.062
I've got some spare
time on my hands.

08:56.063 --> 08:58.982
You said you have an offer
that I can't refuse.

08:58.983 --> 09:01.117
Well, by all means.

09:01.118 --> 09:03.285
What do you have in mind?

09:05.321 --> 09:06.706
Good.
You're awake.

09:06.707 --> 09:09.302
We thought you could use
a little sunshine.

09:17.667 --> 09:20.437
Looking for this?

09:20.438 --> 09:22.639
Aw. You know the rules.

09:22.640 --> 09:25.859
Bad girls don't get nice jewelry.

09:25.860 --> 09:29.729
You took my ring.
I'm devastated.

09:29.730 --> 09:31.197
And bored.

09:31.198 --> 09:33.516
Can I go back to solitary now?

09:33.517 --> 09:36.151
No. I kind of like
you in the hot seat.

09:37.237 --> 09:39.990
Whenever you're ready, brother.

09:39.991 --> 09:42.008
Am I supposed to be scared?

09:42.009 --> 09:44.310
You will be.

09:44.311 --> 09:47.297
And when you are,
focus on that fear.

09:47.298 --> 09:48.999
It's the key to getting
your humanity back.

09:49.000 --> 09:50.366
You're not gonna burn me.

09:50.367 --> 09:53.470
- You don't think so?
- No.

09:53.471 --> 09:56.056
And even if you do manage
to get my emotions back,

09:56.057 --> 09:57.841
I'll remember all this.

09:57.842 --> 10:00.175
And I'll hate both of you for it.

10:02.345 --> 10:05.431
Tsk. Worth the risk.

10:10.403 --> 10:13.907
Aah! Ugh!

10:19.231 --> 10:23.921
Aah!

10:25.507 --> 10:27.208
That feels better, huh?

10:27.209 --> 10:31.179
How about a little gratitude
or any human emotion whatsoever?

10:31.180 --> 10:32.712
And we can stop this.

10:37.919 --> 10:39.920
I didn't quite catch that.

10:39.921 --> 10:43.357
I said, I'm gonna kill you.

10:43.358 --> 10:45.985
Bingo. See? There's a little rage.

10:45.986 --> 10:48.696
I should have figured that'd be the
first emotion that came out of you.

10:48.697 --> 10:50.097
I tend to pull that out of people.

10:50.098 --> 10:53.234
Elena, look at me.
We don't want to do this, ok?

10:53.235 --> 10:56.053
You can stop this right now.
It's your choice.

10:57.489 --> 10:59.991
Kind of funny, actually,

10:59.992 --> 11:02.610
you being the one
to pull back the curtain.

11:02.611 --> 11:04.462
I bet part of you enjoys it

11:04.463 --> 11:07.914
since, you know, I
dumped you and all.

11:09.050 --> 11:12.135
Wow. That was downright vindictive.

11:12.136 --> 11:13.754
See? I think now we're
breaking through

11:13.755 --> 11:15.556
that tough candy shell

11:15.557 --> 11:18.643
and getting into the ooey-gooey
rich center of your humanity.

11:18.644 --> 11:21.894
This is good. I think we should
shine some light on the subject.

11:25.132 --> 11:27.335
Let me guess...

11:27.336 --> 11:30.384
This is gonna hurt you
a lot more than it hurts me.

11:32.924 --> 11:34.725
Look, I know what
you're going through.

11:34.726 --> 11:36.744
After all you've
done, you're afraid

11:36.745 --> 11:38.162
to face the guilt you'll feel

11:38.163 --> 11:39.930
if you turned your
emotions back on.

11:41.249 --> 11:43.117
The only way we can help you

11:43.118 --> 11:45.452
is to make the alternative
hurt even worse.

11:49.990 --> 11:51.843
Aah! Aah...

11:51.844 --> 11:54.762
Oh, we have to keep talking.
If we don't keep talking,

11:54.763 --> 11:56.163
then I won't be able to stop
myself from listening in.

11:56.164 --> 11:59.716
And I can't stand to hear
Elena in pain.

12:01.269 --> 12:05.338
- What do you want to talk about?
- I don't know. Anything.

12:07.191 --> 12:10.778
- I ordered you a cap and gown.
- You did?

12:10.779 --> 12:12.146
I just figured that you'd forget,

12:12.147 --> 12:14.649
so I ordered yours
when I ordered mine.

12:14.650 --> 12:16.733
And I got one for Elena, too.

12:20.354 --> 12:22.496
It's gonna work.

12:25.159 --> 12:27.715
We're gonna get Elena back.

12:36.254 --> 12:38.672
What the hell is she doing here?

12:42.593 --> 12:44.545
Hi.

12:44.546 --> 12:46.480
I don't mean to interfere.

12:46.481 --> 12:48.599
It's just I happen to know
all they keep in this house

12:48.600 --> 12:50.234
is blood and booze.

12:50.235 --> 12:54.070
So I brought a peace offering.
Burgers?

12:55.406 --> 12:56.691
Thanks.

12:56.692 --> 12:59.360
Yeah, we can't really
entertain right now,

12:59.361 --> 13:02.363
- but thanks for stopping by.
- I think I might stay.

13:02.364 --> 13:04.382
Matt mentioned that he

13:04.383 --> 13:07.451
was failing classes
and needed a study buddy.

13:07.452 --> 13:08.703
You're failing?

13:08.704 --> 13:12.340
Well, why didn't you
ask me to help you study?

13:12.341 --> 13:15.426
- Well, I didn't exactly ask her.
- Well, what classes are you failing?

13:15.427 --> 13:19.747
I'm not failing.
I'm just really, really behind.

13:19.748 --> 13:24.018
- History and Italian and math.
- Matt!

13:24.019 --> 13:26.086
This year's been
a little distracting.

13:26.087 --> 13:28.723
We could both help.
"All hands on deck."

13:28.724 --> 13:31.686
- That's the motto around here, right?
- We don't have a motto.

13:33.093 --> 13:36.881
Look, if you need to study,
we're gonna study.

13:36.882 --> 13:39.066
I'm gonna go home,
and I'm gonna get

13:39.067 --> 13:42.903
my flash cards and my study guides
and some energy bars.

13:42.904 --> 13:44.654
This is gonna be good.

13:46.991 --> 13:50.788
- You dated that?
- She likes projects.

14:07.127 --> 14:08.845
Who's there?

14:11.983 --> 14:15.436
- Oh, my God.
- Hello, Caroline.

14:16.655 --> 14:18.489
Let me get this straight.

14:18.490 --> 14:21.442
You want me to hand
over Silas' tombstone?

14:21.443 --> 14:23.944
What makes you think
I even have it?

14:23.945 --> 14:26.113
I know you took it from the island.

14:26.114 --> 14:27.448
You're a scavenger. You'd
never leave it behind.

14:27.449 --> 14:29.917
So you're working
for Silas now, huh?

14:29.918 --> 14:33.487
Running errands for the big,
bad immortal.

14:33.488 --> 14:36.457
I didn't switch sides.

14:36.458 --> 14:38.292
In two days, there'll
be a full moon.

14:38.293 --> 14:41.512
Silas wants me to harness its power
to drop the veil

14:41.513 --> 14:43.297
between our side
and the other side.

14:43.298 --> 14:46.300
He wants to take the cure,
and then he wants to die.

14:46.301 --> 14:48.686
I said I'd help him,

14:48.687 --> 14:50.888
and I've been hiding
from him ever since,

14:50.889 --> 14:52.472
buying time.

14:53.324 --> 14:55.943
- Time for what?
- You don't need to worry about it.

14:55.944 --> 14:57.845
You just need to bring
me the tombstone.

14:57.846 --> 14:59.012
It's a hunk of rock.

14:59.013 --> 15:02.233
- What do you even want with it?
- The less you know, the better.

15:02.234 --> 15:03.784
Silas is psychic.

15:03.785 --> 15:05.453
He can get into people's
heads, read their minds,

15:05.454 --> 15:07.621
make them see things
that aren't really there.

15:07.622 --> 15:09.707
I'm taking a big enough
risk just talking to you.

15:09.708 --> 15:12.693
Ok. Then how do I know
that you're not him?

15:12.694 --> 15:15.195
You don't. But I'm not.

15:15.196 --> 15:18.332
And what makes you so
sure that I'm not him?

15:18.333 --> 15:20.551
Because he can't get
into my head anymore.

15:20.552 --> 15:24.387
Because I am the only one
who can see his true face.

15:28.759 --> 15:30.394
What's in it for me?

15:30.395 --> 15:32.346
Bring me the tombstone.

15:32.347 --> 15:35.516
Help me stop Silas from
unleashing hell on earth.

15:35.517 --> 15:39.385
Believe me, I'll make it
worth your while.

15:53.502 --> 15:54.869
You're gonna
thank me for this.

15:54.870 --> 15:56.420
After you turn it back on,

15:56.421 --> 15:58.372
you'll realize life
with no emotions blew.

15:58.373 --> 16:02.075
You know what else blew?
Being sired to you.

16:02.076 --> 16:06.380
Going every day believing
that I was in love with you.

16:06.381 --> 16:09.717
I remember every
horrible moment of it.

16:09.718 --> 16:13.687
And you...
So scared that it wasn't real.

16:13.688 --> 16:15.438
Well, guess what.
It wasn't.

16:16.423 --> 16:17.775
You were right.

16:17.776 --> 16:20.977
So go ahead. Keep trying
to get the old me back.

16:22.613 --> 16:25.932
Who knows? Maybe Stefan and
I will give it another go.

16:44.452 --> 16:48.806
I am the girl that you love.

16:48.807 --> 16:50.841
You wouldn't do anything
to actually hurt me.

16:50.842 --> 16:52.592
You just proved that.

16:54.628 --> 16:58.014
So what do I really
have to be afraid of?

17:02.909 --> 17:06.067
So that went well.

17:06.068 --> 17:08.737
Every other vampire
turns it on, no problem.

17:08.738 --> 17:10.505
You kill. You feed.

17:10.506 --> 17:12.507
You do all the awful things
that a vampire does.

17:12.508 --> 17:15.176
And then when you're done,
you turn it back on.

17:15.178 --> 17:17.762
Why is she being so stubborn?

17:19.248 --> 17:20.882
Because she has nothing
to come back to.

17:20.883 --> 17:22.883
Her home's gone.
Her family's gone.

17:22.884 --> 17:26.253
She alienated her friends.
She destroyed her relationships.

17:26.255 --> 17:27.888
No. She wants to come back.

17:27.890 --> 17:30.792
Scaring the hell out of
her should have worked.

17:30.793 --> 17:33.228
She's smart. She knows
we're not gonna hurt her.

17:33.229 --> 17:36.748
All right. So we get somebody else,
somebody who really will hurt her.

17:36.749 --> 17:38.149
Who?

17:39.267 --> 17:41.737
- Katherine?
- Think about it.

17:41.738 --> 17:43.755
She's the reason
Jeremy's dead, right?

17:43.756 --> 17:46.056
So if anybody's gonna
provoke an emotion, it's her.

17:46.057 --> 17:48.577
So we call her
and then what? Beg her

17:48.578 --> 17:49.745
to help us out of the
kindness of her own heart?

17:49.746 --> 17:51.079
You kidding me?

17:51.080 --> 17:52.297
Katherine was just
abandoned by Elijah.

17:52.298 --> 17:53.882
She has nothing.
She has no one.

17:53.883 --> 17:57.952
We invite her into our house
to come torture Elena.

17:59.304 --> 18:01.556
There's no way she's
gonna turn that down.

18:01.557 --> 18:04.142
Everyone said that
you were gone for good.

18:04.143 --> 18:05.761
That's true.

18:05.762 --> 18:08.096
But I never meant to go
without saying good-bye.

18:08.097 --> 18:10.265
You don't owe me an explanation.

18:10.266 --> 18:14.236
You're moving on.
By all means, go.

18:14.237 --> 18:16.137
Well, that's just it, isn't it?

18:16.138 --> 18:18.773
I never had any intention
of moving on.

18:22.143 --> 18:25.364
The truth is, I've tried to
stop thinking about you.

18:25.365 --> 18:27.315
And I can't.

18:29.168 --> 18:31.787
Come to New Orleans.

18:31.788 --> 18:35.674
- What are you afraid of?
- You!

18:35.675 --> 18:37.459
I'm afraid of you.

18:37.460 --> 18:41.930
Wouldn't it be more accurate to say
you're afraid of yourself,

18:41.931 --> 18:44.516
your darkest desires?

18:44.517 --> 18:46.968
Elena was right, wasn't she?

18:46.969 --> 18:53.391
Deep down, you long to have
your perfect feathers ruffled.

18:54.976 --> 18:58.814
How do you know what Elena
said to me in that cell?

18:58.815 --> 19:00.213
- Aah!
- Then again...

19:00.214 --> 19:03.618
There's so much to be afraid of,
isn't there, like what I'll do to you

19:03.619 --> 19:06.571
if your friend Bonnie
doesn't come out of hiding.

19:06.572 --> 19:07.773
Where is she?

19:07.774 --> 19:10.492
- Silas.
- Where is she?!

19:11.828 --> 19:14.379
She's not at home.
She's not anywhere.

19:14.380 --> 19:19.301
Bonnie is playing games with me.
And I don't like it.

19:19.302 --> 19:23.472
Tell her I'm looking for her.

19:23.473 --> 19:26.207
Tell her to come
out of the shadows.

19:26.208 --> 19:29.711
Tell her that this...

19:29.712 --> 19:31.595
Is only the beginning.

19:41.323 --> 19:45.393
What time will Caroline return
from the train station?

19:48.247 --> 19:51.733
Well, that's handy.
Sort of a cheat, though, isn't it?

19:51.734 --> 19:53.234
Not everyone's had a thousand years

19:53.235 --> 19:55.036
to learn everything
about everything.

19:55.037 --> 19:58.373
I'm not sure how good I am
at learning Italian.

19:58.374 --> 20:00.041
I was fluent in the 12th century,

20:00.042 --> 20:01.576
but languages have
a way of evolving.

20:01.577 --> 20:04.078
So can you help or not?

20:04.079 --> 20:05.580
Of course I can.

20:05.581 --> 20:08.750
Don't be cranky.
I was just teasing.

20:08.751 --> 20:10.886
I'm sorry. I just don't
want to get left behind

20:10.887 --> 20:14.556
when all my friends go to college
and I'm the only repeat senior.

20:14.557 --> 20:16.441
The only reason that
you are failing is

20:16.442 --> 20:20.028
because you're preoccupied
with training doomed hunters

20:20.029 --> 20:22.063
and dealing with Elena's drama.

20:22.064 --> 20:26.116
You need better friends,
like me.

20:27.536 --> 20:31.405
I could compel you good grades,
get a scholarship.

20:32.741 --> 20:34.209
I don't want to do that.

20:34.210 --> 20:38.663
Why not? Everyone needs
an advantage in life.

20:38.664 --> 20:40.464
I could be yours.

20:45.119 --> 20:48.122
When you convinced me to
save April Young's life

20:48.123 --> 20:49.724
at the prom,

20:49.725 --> 20:52.928
I realized that I could
be a better person.

20:52.929 --> 20:55.296
And I'm grateful for that.

20:55.297 --> 20:57.815
So let me give you some advice.

20:59.401 --> 21:02.520
Take advantage of
what I'm offering you.

21:03.438 --> 21:05.139
Make something of yourself.

21:06.525 --> 21:08.076
For the record,

21:08.077 --> 21:11.862
anyone who leaves you
behind is a fool.

21:14.616 --> 21:16.484
I wouldn't.

21:17.486 --> 21:20.321
What a beautiful sentiment.

21:20.322 --> 21:23.341
Seriously?
You can't knock?

21:23.342 --> 21:26.761
Sorry. I didn't realize
we were standing on formalities.

21:26.762 --> 21:29.330
- What the hell are you doing here?
- You didn't get the memo?

21:29.331 --> 21:32.717
I'm here to talk some sense
into poor emotionless Elena.

21:32.718 --> 21:36.888
- Are you out of your mind?
- You got a better idea, prom King?

21:36.889 --> 21:38.640
Unless you want me to lock you up

21:38.641 --> 21:40.775
in there with her, I
suggest you shut up

21:40.776 --> 21:42.509
and let the adults handle this.

21:43.645 --> 21:44.845
Well, it looks
like the lunatics

21:44.847 --> 21:46.565
have taken over the asylum.

21:46.566 --> 21:49.350
- Where are you going?
- I'm calling Caroline.

21:49.351 --> 21:50.368
There's no way we're
letting that psycho

21:50.369 --> 21:51.987
in there with Elena.

22:12.874 --> 22:14.375
- Caroline!
- Aah! Oh.

22:14.376 --> 22:15.376
- Where have you been?
- Matt!

22:15.377 --> 22:16.711
We have to get out of here.

22:16.712 --> 22:18.179
No, Caroline.
Caroline, wait. It's ok.

22:18.180 --> 22:19.180
No, it's not ok.

22:19.181 --> 22:20.381
Silas is out there.

22:20.382 --> 22:22.050
And he made me think
that he was Klaus...

22:22.051 --> 22:23.384
What are you talking about?
What's Silas want with you?

22:23.385 --> 22:24.686
He's trying to get to Bonnie.

22:24.687 --> 22:26.187
Do you know where Bonnie is?

22:26.188 --> 22:27.822
If I knew where she was,

22:27.823 --> 22:29.524
I wouldn't bother with you.

22:29.525 --> 22:32.327
Now, get me Bonnie, or
I'm going to kill someone.

22:32.328 --> 22:35.080
Maybe I'll start with your mother.

22:40.919 --> 22:42.337
No one in the house can help you.

22:42.338 --> 22:45.457
Find Bonnie or I'll kill the person
you love the most.

22:53.549 --> 22:56.051
I know. I promised
I wouldn't work too late.

22:56.052 --> 22:59.604
Mom, I need you to get home
and lock all the doors right now.

22:59.605 --> 23:02.357
Don't let anyone inside,
not even me because I have a key,

23:02.358 --> 23:04.809
so I can let myself in.
Do you understand?

23:04.810 --> 23:08.808
- What's going on?
- Just do it, OK? I'm on my way.

23:35.973 --> 23:38.842
Oh, honey, you look awful.

23:42.463 --> 23:47.135
- What the hell are you doing here?
- Your boyfriends invited me.

23:47.136 --> 23:49.186
They want to know if
you still have a heart.

23:52.140 --> 23:53.608
There it is.

23:53.609 --> 23:55.143
Your bodyguards
won't let me kill you,

23:55.144 --> 23:57.478
but I can rip your throat out.

23:57.479 --> 24:00.480
So I don't have
to listen to you whine.

24:03.284 --> 24:08.506
But first, satisfy my curiosity.

24:08.507 --> 24:11.409
What did you tell Elijah
back in Willoughby?

24:11.410 --> 24:14.662
That's why you're here.

24:14.663 --> 24:18.016
He dumped you, didn't he?

24:18.017 --> 24:20.551
Now you're just looking
for a scapegoat.

24:22.137 --> 24:25.140
Tell me what you said
to turn him against me

24:25.141 --> 24:28.025
or I will feed you
your own eyeballs.

24:30.145 --> 24:33.181
I didn't have to say anything.

24:33.182 --> 24:34.532
Look at you.

24:34.533 --> 24:38.319
A self-obsessed egomaniac
on the run for 5 centuries.

24:38.320 --> 24:41.155
What good would you be to anyone?

24:42.490 --> 24:45.526
You're the definition
of damaged goods.

24:46.661 --> 24:48.908
No wonder Elijah left you.

24:50.999 --> 24:54.002
Yeah, I've done some pretty
horrible things to survive.

24:54.003 --> 24:58.556
But unlike you,
poor, delicate Elena,

24:58.557 --> 25:02.644
I don't turn it off.
I deal with it.

25:02.645 --> 25:05.180
You wouldn't last a week
as a vampire

25:05.181 --> 25:07.731
without everyone fawning over you.

25:13.988 --> 25:17.224
But I'd love to see you try.

25:28.031 --> 25:31.542
All that pain and torture of her
took quite a thirst.

25:31.543 --> 25:32.877
It couldn't have anything to do

25:32.878 --> 25:34.595
with the fact that
Elena called you out

25:34.596 --> 25:36.247
on your recent boy
trouble, could it?

25:36.248 --> 25:38.216
Sorry. I couldn't
help but overhear.

25:38.217 --> 25:41.252
Did you ever think Elena
would have been better off

25:41.253 --> 25:42.520
if she'd never met you?

25:42.521 --> 25:44.022
You're trying to get
a rise out of me?

25:44.023 --> 25:45.590
Because my emotions are fine.

25:45.591 --> 25:48.810
I love Elena.
I despise you.

25:48.811 --> 25:51.145
Mm, so romantic.

25:51.146 --> 25:53.281
So doomed to fail.

25:53.282 --> 25:56.934
You know, as soon as she
goes back to her old self,

25:56.935 --> 25:59.120
she'll go straight to Stefan.

25:59.121 --> 26:03.708
That's the tragedy of you.
You never get the girl.

26:03.709 --> 26:05.576
- She's gone.
- What?

26:05.577 --> 26:07.495
Elena's not in her cell.
I'm gonna check the grounds.

26:07.496 --> 26:09.080
Find out what she did.

26:09.081 --> 26:12.667
Oops.
Did I forget to lock her in?

26:12.668 --> 26:16.754
Let's just say I've lost interest
in Elena's recovery.

26:16.755 --> 26:19.290
I'd rather watch her tear
through an orphanage. Heh heh.

26:19.291 --> 26:22.727
Imagine trying to come back
from a spiral like that.

26:22.728 --> 26:24.595
- Elena's gone?
- What happened?

26:24.596 --> 26:26.564
Donovan,
you're coming with me.

26:26.565 --> 26:28.149
Why should he?

26:28.150 --> 26:29.684
Because Elena's hungry and missing.

26:29.685 --> 26:33.604
For once, his life
might actually have a purpose.

26:33.605 --> 26:35.239
Bonnie, why aren't you answering?

26:35.240 --> 26:37.608
Silas isn't going to just give up.

26:37.609 --> 26:39.827
You're the only one that
can stop him. Call me.

26:41.447 --> 26:43.748
Caroline, what's going on?

26:43.749 --> 26:45.165
Mom, don't come any closer. Stop.

26:47.652 --> 26:49.153
What's wrong?

26:49.154 --> 26:51.155
I don't know how to tell
if it's really you.

26:51.156 --> 26:54.425
What if this is another trick?

26:54.426 --> 26:56.360
Well, he can get in my head.

26:56.361 --> 26:58.179
And he would have known
that I called you.

26:58.180 --> 27:02.350
Ok, Caroline. It's me.

27:02.351 --> 27:03.935
It's your mother.

27:03.936 --> 27:08.139
I don't know what's happening,
but everything's going to be ok.

27:08.140 --> 27:09.307
All right?

27:09.308 --> 27:11.674
You just need to talk to me.

27:21.487 --> 27:25.906
- Hi. How's it going?
- Oh, good.

27:52.733 --> 27:55.269
Ugh. Ahh.

27:55.270 --> 27:58.104
Please help me.

28:01.058 --> 28:03.528
Matt.

28:03.529 --> 28:06.446
Thank God you found me.

28:08.533 --> 28:10.201
Elena, stop. I know you
don't want to do this.

28:10.202 --> 28:13.538
- I know you don't want to hurt me.
- I'm a vampire, Matt.

28:13.539 --> 28:17.758
The thing about vampires
is that we need to feed.

28:17.759 --> 28:19.760
No, but you're more than that.

28:19.761 --> 28:21.879
You're my friend.
You're my oldest friend.

28:21.880 --> 28:23.965
You're the girl that
I've loved longer

28:23.966 --> 28:25.715
than I can remember.

28:26.884 --> 28:28.686
Whatever wall you want to put up,

28:28.687 --> 28:31.605
I know that still means
something to you.

28:34.308 --> 28:36.109
Deep down...

28:37.528 --> 28:39.446
It probably does mean something...

28:40.982 --> 28:42.949
But I am really hungry.

28:45.964 --> 28:48.189
Bonnie hasn't called back yet.

28:48.190 --> 28:51.192
I just don't understand
why she hasn't called.

28:52.194 --> 28:56.896
Caroline? There you are.
What's going on?

28:58.115 --> 29:00.168
Are you all right?

29:00.169 --> 29:02.069
I've been calling you for hours.

29:02.070 --> 29:05.273
Sorry. I came as soon
as I got the message.

29:06.741 --> 29:08.709
Caroline, let me in.

29:08.710 --> 29:09.877
Let me help.

29:09.878 --> 29:11.245
How do I know it's you?

29:11.246 --> 29:14.398
Silas keeps getting in my head,
attacking me.

29:14.399 --> 29:15.933
He says he wants to
know where you are.

29:15.934 --> 29:17.585
He threatened my mother.

29:17.586 --> 29:18.586
Caroline?

29:18.587 --> 29:20.203
Mom, just stay there.

29:22.756 --> 29:25.142
Caroline, that is not your mother.

29:25.143 --> 29:26.943
What's going on?

29:29.964 --> 29:31.432
Oh, my God.

29:31.433 --> 29:33.618
Did you really think
you could hide from me,

29:33.619 --> 29:35.036
Bonnie?

29:35.037 --> 29:38.422
I'm here now. What did
you do to her mother?

29:38.423 --> 29:39.773
She's right where you left her.

29:39.774 --> 29:41.625
Mom?

29:44.629 --> 29:46.130
Mom! Ohh...

29:46.131 --> 29:48.716
I thought you and I
were on the same side.

29:48.717 --> 29:51.135
We are. The full moon
isn't for two more days.

29:51.136 --> 29:53.971
I've been gathering my strength,
preparing myself.

29:53.972 --> 29:55.923
You're the only one
who can do this spell.

29:55.924 --> 29:57.558
So I can't hurt you.

29:57.559 --> 30:00.094
But I can hurt the people you love.

30:00.095 --> 30:02.597
You do understand that, right?

30:02.598 --> 30:05.099
I understand.
I will do your spell.

30:05.100 --> 30:07.301
I will drop the veil.
And I will help you die.

30:07.302 --> 30:09.103
I promise.

30:09.104 --> 30:11.605
Just don't hurt my friends.

30:15.276 --> 30:18.029
Come on. Please.
Please, please, please.

30:18.030 --> 30:19.497
Mom...

30:19.498 --> 30:22.250
Your promise is binding, Bonnie.

30:22.251 --> 30:25.836
If you break it, you
have to answer to me.

30:25.837 --> 30:27.622
I won't break it.

30:27.623 --> 30:29.523
Then you should leave
this house right now.

30:29.524 --> 30:31.842
And the next time I
come looking for you,

30:31.843 --> 30:35.012
I expect you to be waiting.

30:35.013 --> 30:36.830
Open... open your eyes, mom.

30:36.831 --> 30:38.516
You need my blood in
your system. Come on.

30:38.517 --> 30:40.166
Mom.

30:41.636 --> 30:43.971
Please, mom. Please...

30:43.972 --> 30:45.690
Mom...

30:45.691 --> 30:47.641
Mom?

30:49.694 --> 30:52.351
Oh, come on. I barely
drained an artery.

30:55.015 --> 30:57.618
Come on. Get up.
I'm hungry.

30:57.619 --> 31:00.187
And my head's fuzzy.
I can't think straight.

31:00.188 --> 31:01.372
I need more.

31:01.373 --> 31:03.654
Elena, stop.

31:05.526 --> 31:08.411
But you're so good.

31:10.715 --> 31:14.334
Hey, hey.
You're cut off.

31:14.335 --> 31:15.489
Let go of me.

31:15.490 --> 31:17.537
- Stop it.
- Enough.

31:19.006 --> 31:20.891
You are acting like
a little spoiled brat.

31:20.892 --> 31:22.476
You know that?

31:22.477 --> 31:25.229
You think that we can't punish you.
Maybe not.

31:25.230 --> 31:27.315
But I can sure punish him.

31:27.316 --> 31:29.550
Elena.

31:29.551 --> 31:32.386
- Seriously? You think this is...
- Shut up.

31:32.387 --> 31:33.853
I'm done playing nice.

31:35.156 --> 31:36.824
Turn your emotions back
on right now, Elena,

31:36.825 --> 31:40.995
or so help me, God, I will give you
something to be sad about.

31:40.996 --> 31:42.246
I will kill him right
here in front of you.

31:42.247 --> 31:43.581
Damon.

31:43.582 --> 31:44.749
Don't "Damon" me.

31:44.750 --> 31:47.418
If she doesn't love anyone, fine.

31:47.419 --> 31:48.902
Prove it.

31:48.903 --> 31:51.238
And if I'm wrong, what
difference does it make?

31:51.239 --> 31:52.423
One less bus boy.

31:52.424 --> 31:54.874
Elena...

31:57.044 --> 31:58.545
You're bluffing.

32:16.063 --> 32:17.097
How about now?

32:17.098 --> 32:19.367
You feel anything now?

32:19.368 --> 32:22.819
You angry I just turned your buddy
into road kill?

32:24.288 --> 32:25.906
Or are you sad

32:25.907 --> 32:27.825
that the guy that
everybody loves is

32:27.826 --> 32:30.076
just a bag of bones?

32:31.078 --> 32:34.615
Remember when he was
a little kid, huh?

32:34.616 --> 32:38.334
Warm heart, big, goofy smile,
his whole life ahead of him.

32:43.257 --> 32:47.633
I guess it was a good idea that he
was wearing this.

32:51.151 --> 32:53.600
Oh, God, Matt.

33:05.162 --> 33:08.816
You feeling that weight
lifting off your chest?

33:08.817 --> 33:09.982
That's joy.

33:11.452 --> 33:13.087
Because your friend isn't dead.

33:13.088 --> 33:18.541
That's emotion, Elena.
That's humanity.

33:35.047 --> 33:36.581
You're gonna be ok.

33:36.582 --> 33:38.383
- No.
- Look at me.

33:38.384 --> 33:41.269
- No. No. No. It's not ok.
- Elena.

33:41.270 --> 33:42.420
What I've done?

33:42.421 --> 33:43.688
- Hey.
- No, no.

33:43.689 --> 33:46.090
What did I do?
I almost killed him.

33:46.091 --> 33:48.776
Matt. I almost... and then Bonnie

33:48.777 --> 33:51.029
and Caroline.
I just... no, no.

33:51.030 --> 33:52.614
I mean, the woman, the waitress.

33:52.615 --> 33:53.865
I actually killed that waitress.

33:53.866 --> 33:55.993
Hey, hey. No! I killed...
That waitress.

33:56.368 --> 33:59.571
Hey. Elena.
Hey. Hey.

33:59.572 --> 34:02.373
Look at me. Look at me.
I know this stage, ok?

34:02.374 --> 34:05.776
The emotions are overwhelming you.
You just have to focus on one thing, ok?

34:05.777 --> 34:07.245
No, I can't. I can't.

34:07.246 --> 34:10.632
You just find that one thing inside
of you that makes you strong.

34:10.632 --> 34:14.284
It's in there.
Just latch on to it.

34:14.286 --> 34:17.304
Channel everything you're feeling
into that one emotion.

34:17.306 --> 34:21.092
Find the thing inside of you
that makes you want to live.

34:21.092 --> 34:25.962
Elena, let it in.
Let it in.

34:31.437 --> 34:33.438
That's good.

34:33.438 --> 34:34.739
That's it.

34:34.739 --> 34:35.989
That's it.

34:35.991 --> 34:39.143
Just breathe it in. Blow
everything else out.

34:39.143 --> 34:40.862
That's good.

34:40.862 --> 34:42.780
That's good.

34:57.512 --> 35:00.163
You ok?

35:01.349 --> 35:03.216
No.

35:05.503 --> 35:06.953
I'm not ok.

35:09.691 --> 35:11.642
But I'll get better.

35:18.533 --> 35:20.034
Come on.

35:20.035 --> 35:22.186
Ok, this will work.

35:39.370 --> 35:41.538
Mom?

35:41.540 --> 35:44.342
Open your eyes.
Come on.

35:44.343 --> 35:47.061
Wake up. You have to wake up.

35:47.062 --> 35:49.763
You have to see me graduate.

35:51.933 --> 35:54.519
I swear I'll get...

35:54.520 --> 35:57.238
I swear I'll get you
out of this town

35:57.239 --> 35:59.741
and find you a nice man.

36:16.257 --> 36:17.708
Mom!

36:28.469 --> 36:30.772
Ok.

36:49.540 --> 36:52.493
I've never actually seen that ring
in action before.

36:52.494 --> 36:53.944
Does it hurt?

36:53.945 --> 36:57.448
You mean getting my neck snapped
or coming back from the dead?

36:57.449 --> 37:00.066
Because they both hurt like hell.

37:01.335 --> 37:03.221
Did it work?

37:03.222 --> 37:04.789
Well, it looks like Elena's

37:04.790 --> 37:08.459
emotional floodgates have
been burst wide open.

37:08.460 --> 37:11.978
So she'll be back to her dull,
sympathetic self in no time.

37:13.765 --> 37:15.800
Here.

37:15.801 --> 37:18.319
That was a brave thing to do.

37:18.320 --> 37:21.354
She saved me from drowning
at the bottom of that river.

37:22.940 --> 37:25.442
I'm just doing what I can
to pay her back.

37:27.612 --> 37:29.814
There aren't enough
apologies in the world

37:29.815 --> 37:32.333
for the part that I played in this.

37:32.334 --> 37:34.819
Running you off the bridge,

37:34.820 --> 37:38.231
Elena becoming a vampire
to save you.

37:40.675 --> 37:43.661
If you don't want me to cheat you
into college, fine.

37:43.662 --> 37:46.997
We'll do it the hard way.
But, Matt...

37:48.833 --> 37:52.520
I will spend every
day until graduation

37:52.521 --> 37:54.995
trying to find a way
to pay you back.

38:03.181 --> 38:08.069
I'm perfectly aware that tombstone
isn't just a hunk of rock.

38:08.070 --> 38:10.320
- No kidding.
- And it got me thinking,

38:10.321 --> 38:13.291
all big spells require
a source of power,

38:13.292 --> 38:16.744
a recurring element
like a full moon,

38:16.745 --> 38:18.995
a comet.

38:18.997 --> 38:20.648
But that tombstone is
filled with the blood

38:20.649 --> 38:23.501
of your ancient relative
Katsooyay or whatever.

38:23.502 --> 38:24.952
Qetsiyah.

38:24.953 --> 38:28.306
She was powerful enough
to create the other side.

38:28.307 --> 38:31.642
So maybe if you have her blood,

38:31.643 --> 38:36.130
you don't need a full
moon to drop the veil.

38:36.131 --> 38:39.133
Maybe you can do it
whenever you want.

38:39.134 --> 38:41.352
The thing I can't figure out is

38:41.353 --> 38:43.437
why do you want to drop
the veil at all?

38:43.438 --> 38:45.339
I have my reasons.

38:45.340 --> 38:49.075
And again, I ask,
what's in it for me?

38:49.077 --> 38:52.914
You'll get the one thing
you want most in this world...

38:52.915 --> 38:56.000
Freedom, survival.

38:56.001 --> 38:58.735
Never having to run
from anyone again.

38:59.871 --> 39:03.007
Once I've dropped the veil,
I can speak to Qetsiyah.

39:03.008 --> 39:05.760
She created the spell
that made Silas

39:05.761 --> 39:08.618
truly immortal, invulnerable
to any weapon.

39:11.349 --> 39:14.768
You'd like that for yourself,
wouldn't you?

39:16.954 --> 39:19.222
I can give it to you.

39:20.925 --> 39:23.143
Bonnie Bennett, we have a deal.

39:26.365 --> 39:27.931
Hey...

39:29.408 --> 39:33.320
There you go.
How you feeling?

39:34.622 --> 39:36.445
The pain's still there.

39:37.758 --> 39:41.428
The grief...
And shame.

39:43.064 --> 39:45.132
I get it now.

39:45.133 --> 39:47.585
Shutting it off, it's a cheat.

39:47.586 --> 39:50.221
I mean, you put up this wall

39:50.222 --> 39:53.590
and shut out everything
that makes you who you are.

39:56.594 --> 39:59.072
Nothing affects you,
nothing matters.

39:59.073 --> 40:02.266
But things do matter...
Things happen that can't be undone

40:02.267 --> 40:05.603
and now I know there's something
I need to do about that.

40:05.604 --> 40:11.776
Elena, what you need to do is rest,
take it easy for a couple of days.

40:11.777 --> 40:14.111
Maybe even a couple of years. Here.

40:14.112 --> 40:17.164
I... I'm done resting.
I have to get ready.

40:17.165 --> 40:18.832
There's so much that I have to do.

40:18.834 --> 40:20.150
Whoa. Hey.

40:20.151 --> 40:21.986
What are you talking about?

40:21.987 --> 40:24.121
Think about it.
It's so obvious.

40:24.122 --> 40:26.340
Go back far enough,

40:26.341 --> 40:28.325
there's one person who
brought us to this...

40:29.677 --> 40:31.628
Who ruined our lives...

40:32.830 --> 40:35.099
And look at you two.

40:35.100 --> 40:37.018
Everything that's happened
to you, she did that.

40:37.019 --> 40:39.603
She brought Klaus to Mystic Falls,

40:39.604 --> 40:41.639
she turned Caroline into a vampire.

40:41.640 --> 40:44.341
She killed my brother.

40:44.342 --> 40:48.012
It all comes down
to her... Katherine.

40:48.013 --> 40:52.650
Ok, Stefan said to focus
on one thing, so I did.

40:52.651 --> 40:54.485
I focused on hate.

40:54.486 --> 40:57.288
And I hate her so much.

40:57.289 --> 40:59.123
Well, I don't think
that's what he meant.

40:59.124 --> 41:00.958
Elena, Katherine's
not worth your time.

41:00.959 --> 41:02.626
Even if you spend 10
minutes of your life

41:02.627 --> 41:05.162
hating her, she wins.

41:05.163 --> 41:08.064
Not if I kill her.
