             tomorrow,
       it's your whole life.

22:01.721 --> 22:04.455
Yeah. I could see how
she would get

22:04.490 --> 22:05.623
                 to be a little
                  possessive.

22:05.658 --> 22:06.791
        Mmm.
   Not only that,

22:06.826 --> 22:08.726
you're gonna lose
all your married friends.

22:08.761 --> 22:10.828
     Uh, all my married friends?
         Yeah.

22:10.863 --> 22:12.730
     Well, the-- The wives
       will hate Jeannie.

22:12.765 --> 22:14.331
Oh, they'll
see her

22:14.366 --> 22:17.601
      catering to you, uh,
   treating you with kindness

22:17.637 --> 22:19.503
        and understanding,
           compassion.

22:19.539 --> 22:21.572
You think they're
gonna sit idly by

22:21.607 --> 22:23.941
      and let her destroy
   everything they stand for?

22:24.744 --> 22:26.010
I see I can
lose the wives.

22:26.045 --> 22:27.544
                 Well,
          no doubt about that.

22:27.579 --> 22:29.113
Now maybe she did go
a little too far

22:29.148 --> 22:30.781
when she took off my shoes.

22:30.816 --> 22:32.983
           Roge...the last thing
                I want to do

22:33.019 --> 22:34.852
       is talk you out of a girl
          you're crazy about.

22:34.887 --> 22:35.953
If she was so great,

22:35.988 --> 22:37.855
how come I was able
to get a date with her...

22:37.890 --> 22:38.856
  just like that?

22:38.891 --> 22:40.190
                Well, I don't
                want to spoil

22:40.225 --> 22:41.659
              anything for you.

22:41.694 --> 22:42.893
There's nothing to spoil.

22:42.928 --> 22:43.961
She overstepped herself

22:43.996 --> 22:45.129
when she tipped the doorman

22:45.164 --> 22:46.664
who helped me into the cab.

22:46.699 --> 22:48.632
           Our friendship's
     the only thing that counts.

22:48.667 --> 22:50.835
Yeah, I-- I don't know
how to thank you, Tony.

22:50.870 --> 22:52.102
If you hadn't talked to me,

22:52.138 --> 22:54.538
I might have made
a terrible fool out of myself.

22:55.908 --> 22:57.808
             Take it easy, Roge.
     Uh, ahem,

22:57.844 --> 23:00.811
T-Tony, you-- Ahem,
you forgot your slide rule.

23:00.847 --> 23:02.279
                  What?
         At 2:00 in the morning?

23:28.441 --> 23:29.506
   Good evening,
      master.

23:29.542 --> 23:30.974
            Oh, hello, Jeannie.
                You're back.

23:31.009 --> 23:33.076
        I thought you'd still
     be out with Captain Healey.

23:33.111 --> 23:35.346
        Oh,
    I left him.

23:35.381 --> 23:37.348
  You were not worried
       about me?

23:37.383 --> 23:38.982
                   Mm? No, no.
                   Not a bit.

23:39.017 --> 23:40.283
              I said to myself:

23:40.319 --> 23:42.353
     "If Jeannie can't take care
        of herself, who can?"

23:42.388 --> 23:44.321
  Oh, I-- I thought
  you might at least

23:44.357 --> 23:45.889
go up to Captain
Healey's apartment

23:45.924 --> 23:47.358
to see if I was all right.

23:47.393 --> 23:49.092
               No, no. No, never
                occurred to me.

23:51.129 --> 23:52.996
          Now who could that be
         at 2:30 in the morning?

23:53.031 --> 23:54.331
   Oh, Jeannie,
   do you mind?

23:55.568 --> 23:56.567
     Thanks.

24:01.474 --> 24:03.006
Roger, what are you
doing here?

24:03.041 --> 24:04.074
            I couldn't sleep,
                  Tony.

24:04.109 --> 24:05.576
         I figured if you needed
               a slide rule

24:05.611 --> 24:06.844
         at 2:00 in the morning,

24:06.879 --> 24:09.045
        you must be working
  on something pretty important.

24:09.081 --> 24:10.347
           So I brought it over.
      Thanks.

24:10.383 --> 24:11.815
   You really didn't
    have to bother.

24:11.851 --> 24:12.849
       Thanks a lot.
          Thanks.

24:20.426 --> 24:21.992
                   Oh, master,
                   you did go

24:22.027 --> 24:23.594
             to Captain Healey's
                  apartment.

24:23.629 --> 24:24.661
Well, only for
a minute.

24:24.697 --> 24:27.430
                  Oh, you were
               worried about me.

24:27.466 --> 24:29.066
     A little bit.

24:29.101 --> 24:31.334
Jeannie, there's one thing
you've got to remember.

24:31.369 --> 24:33.303
                 What is that?

24:33.338 --> 24:34.671
    I'm only human.
