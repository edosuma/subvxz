-They fell through a portal.

DAVID: |Wi|| find them.

00:12.722 --> 00:13.757
I will always find them.

00:14.473 --> 00:15.462
(GRUNTS) Emma, run!

00:16.184 --> 00:17.173

00:17.268 --> 00:18.257
Can you hear me?

WOMAN: Do you need help?

00:19.478 --> 00:21.469
-Who are you?
-My name is Cora.

00:21.606 --> 00:23.142
-RED RIDING HOOD: Who are they?
-King George.

00:23.232 --> 00:24.221
Bring me his head.

00:30.573 --> 00:32.484
King George's men are here
on this ridge.

00:32.617 --> 00:34.357
We have to move camp.
They're coming for us.

00:34.452 --> 00:36.067
No! We will not run!

00:36.162 --> 00:37.823
We said we were going
to take the kingdom back,

00:37.914 --> 00:39.950
and we can't do that with our tails
between our legs.

00:41.250 --> 00:42.239
No offense.

00:42.752 --> 00:44.037
But matters have worsened.

00:44.337 --> 00:45.372
The King has a new general.

00:45.463 --> 00:46.418
Who is he?

00:46.505 --> 00:48.006
They call him the Leviathan.

00:48.090 --> 00:51.298
They say he attacks like a monster
striking from the depths of the sea.

00:51.385 --> 00:54.343
You never see him coming,
and you never survive.

00:54.472 --> 00:55.552
We'll see about that.

00:55.640 --> 00:57.926
-How close is his army?
-(THUD)

00:58.893 --> 01:00.633
I'd say pretty close.

of escaping on your own.

01:17.495 --> 01:18.484
Don't worry.

01:18.579 --> 01:20.080
Meet me in two days' time at the cabin.

01:20.164 --> 01:22.155
The cabin? Where she is?

01:22.250 --> 01:23.239
Are you sure?

01:23.334 --> 01:24.824
We're engaged.

01:24.919 --> 01:26.659
I think it's about time
you met my mother.

It's a little island our captors like
to think of as their haven.

Haven?

02:35.156 --> 02:36.145

02:36.615 --> 02:38.401
The world's dangerous.

02:38.492 --> 02:40.107

02:40.202 --> 02:42.329
Well, they can't keep us down here.
We didn't do anything wrong.

02:42.997 --> 02:44.077
Neither did I.

02:44.165 --> 02:45.621
Then why are you here?

02:46.292 --> 02:49.659
I'm here because of something
my daughter did.

02:49.962 --> 02:52.203
The curse that ravaged this land?

02:52.923 --> 02:54.129
She cast it.

02:54.216 --> 02:55.592
Regina?

02:56.010 --> 02:57.796
-You're Regina's mother?
-Yes.

02:57.887 --> 02:59.798
But you have nothing to fear from me.

03:10.649 --> 03:12.560
Oh, Snow, you're awake. I'm so relieved.

03:15.363 --> 03:20.198
As bad as you think Regina is,
this woman is worse.

03:20.826 --> 03:22.282
Oh, Snow.

Sweet Snow, please believe me.

03:36.842 --> 03:38.002
Okay.

03:38.302 --> 03:41.840
Right now, we're at the bottom of a hole
with no other options.

03:41.931 --> 03:44.718
And Henry is back in Storybrooke
with Regina.

03:45.351 --> 03:46.511
Who's Henry?

03:47.228 --> 03:50.140
My son. I kind of share him with Regina.
It's complicated.

03:50.231 --> 03:52.347
Don't talk to her!

for Operation Scorpion?

04:04.412 --> 04:06.949

to find Emma and Snow.

04:07.289 --> 04:09.541

That was my second choice.

04:09.625 --> 04:10.831
Henry, we need to talk.

04:10.918 --> 04:12.158
Yeah, Scorpion's better.

04:12.253 --> 04:13.493
No, it's not that.

04:13.587 --> 04:14.793
It's...

04:15.631 --> 04:17.337
I'm not coming with you?

04:17.758 --> 04:19.749
But I thought we were going
to find Jefferson.

04:20.386 --> 04:22.377
-I already did.
-What?

04:22.680 --> 04:23.795
Is he gonna help us?

04:23.889 --> 04:26.175
(SIGHS) No. No, Henry, he's not.

04:26.267 --> 04:28.258
But why didn't you tell me
you talked to him?

04:28.811 --> 04:30.517
Because I didn't want to disappoint you.

04:30.980 --> 04:34.017
I know you want to find your mom,
but Jefferson can't help us.

04:34.275 --> 04:36.436
I need to find a way to restore the hat.

04:36.527 --> 04:38.142
So why can't I help you look?

04:38.237 --> 04:40.853
It'll require magic, Henry, and magic...

04:40.948 --> 04:42.939
Always comes with a price.

04:43.033 --> 04:44.239
I've read the book, you know?

04:44.326 --> 04:47.284
I'm sorry, but Ijust can't let you
anywhere near this stuff.

04:47.371 --> 04:48.656
If you really want to help me,

04:48.747 --> 04:51.238
you'll go to school
where I know you'll be safe. Okay?

you have trusted me?

I was just trying to find a way
to get us home.

05:13.772 --> 05:14.978
I could have handled her.

05:15.065 --> 05:16.054

05:16.150 --> 05:17.606
Don't be so sure.

05:18.319 --> 05:21.402

I know this world and its dangers.

I was helpless here?

05:30.289 --> 05:31.529
No.

05:33.292 --> 05:34.657

05:53.979 --> 05:57.471
Wait, if I had known that you were
the prisoners Mulan had brought back,

05:57.566 --> 05:59.067
I never would've locked you away.

06:00.027 --> 06:02.143
-Please, forgive me.
-Of course.

06:02.238 --> 06:03.728
Lancelot? Really?

06:04.490 --> 06:07.448
He's an old friend. We can trust him.

06:07.993 --> 06:09.449
Why is he embracing them?

06:09.537 --> 06:11.277
They were responsible
for Phillip's death.

06:11.372 --> 06:12.703
You're new here, Aurora.

06:12.873 --> 06:15.831
Phillip trusted Lancelot. So must we.

06:15.918 --> 06:17.249
I want justice.

06:17.336 --> 06:18.371
Tread carefully.

06:18.879 --> 06:21.165
It's dangerous to confuse
vengeance with justice.

06:21.924 --> 06:23.755
Do you understand me?

06:27.471 --> 06:28.836
Do you understand me?

06:30.975 --> 06:32.260
Yes.

06:52.204 --> 06:53.865
What the hell is that?

06:53.956 --> 06:55.742
That is Chimera.

06:55.833 --> 06:57.664
An acquired taste,

06:57.751 --> 06:59.787
but all our hunting party
could bring back.

06:59.878 --> 07:02.711
One part lion, one part serpent,

07:02.798 --> 07:04.163
one part goat.

07:04.258 --> 07:05.293
Like a turducken?

07:05.384 --> 07:06.419
I don't understand.

07:06.510 --> 07:08.876
We were told this land
didn't even exist anymore.

07:08.971 --> 07:10.427
How did you all escape the curse?

07:10.514 --> 07:11.549
It is a mystery.

07:11.932 --> 07:13.433
The curse struck,
and when the smoke cleared,

07:13.517 --> 07:15.053
most of us had been torn from this land.

07:15.436 --> 07:18.473
But some of us here, in this
particular region, were left behind.

07:18.564 --> 07:21.180
We don't know how
and we don't know why.

07:21.275 --> 07:23.732
Finding this safe haven wasn't easy.

07:23.819 --> 07:25.184
It took some spilt blood.

07:25.446 --> 07:27.903
But, worry not, you're safe here.

07:28.657 --> 07:29.646
We can't stay.

07:29.867 --> 07:32.028
My husband's back there.
Emma's son, my grandson.

07:32.119 --> 07:33.950
We have to get back to them.

07:34.038 --> 07:35.494
Can you help us find a portal?

07:35.581 --> 07:36.912
No, leaving is unwise.

07:37.166 --> 07:39.077
The enchanted forest
is not as you remember it.

07:39.585 --> 07:40.620
The Ogres have returned.

07:41.086 --> 07:44.795
Ogres? Like, as in "Fee-Fi-Fo-Fum"?

07:44.882 --> 07:45.962
Those would be giants.

07:47.217 --> 07:49.003
Ogres are far worse.

07:49.094 --> 07:51.961
That's why we live here on this island,
where it's safe.

07:52.765 --> 07:56.132
Please, Snow, stay here.
There are no more portals left.

07:56.810 --> 07:58.346
I might know of one.

07:58.437 --> 07:59.426
You do?

08:00.356 --> 08:01.345
Where?

08:02.983 --> 08:03.972
Cora's near.

08:04.109 --> 08:06.191
I don't feel comfortable voicing my plans.

08:06.320 --> 08:07.355
She's powerful.

08:07.446 --> 08:08.652
Not anymore.

08:08.739 --> 08:10.695
The curse stripped her of her powers.

08:10.949 --> 08:12.814
But given her reputation,

08:12.910 --> 08:14.775
we've kept her locked up
as a precaution.

08:14.870 --> 08:16.371
Nevertheless, I'm not taking chances.

08:16.997 --> 08:18.988
Trust me, I may have a way.

08:19.541 --> 08:20.747
Let us go.

08:23.754 --> 08:24.743
I'II allow it.

08:25.130 --> 08:26.540
But on one condition.

08:28.592 --> 08:30.173
Take my bravest warrior with you.

08:30.344 --> 08:32.801
Allow Mulan to defend you.

08:33.013 --> 08:34.753
-We can defend ourselves.
-Deal.

08:35.724 --> 08:37.385
Thank you, Lancelot.

08:37.935 --> 08:39.891
For always looking out for me.

08:40.604 --> 08:41.593
(PANTING)

08:42.773 --> 08:45.264
I don't care what you do to me.
I will never tell you where he is!

08:45.359 --> 08:47.600
I know. That's not why you're here.

08:48.737 --> 08:50.068
Would you bring our guest some water?

08:53.117 --> 08:54.982
Times have been good
for you, haven't they?

08:55.077 --> 08:56.942
I can see a light in your eyes.

08:57.913 --> 08:59.153
Cherish that.

08:59.498 --> 09:01.238
Because that light can die

09:01.333 --> 09:03.369
and be replaced by something else.

09:03.460 --> 09:04.449
Pain.

09:05.838 --> 09:08.955
The only thing you know of pain
is how to inflict it.

09:09.049 --> 09:11.335
That's where you're so very, very wrong.

09:11.593 --> 09:13.504
I've had my share of pain.

09:14.388 --> 09:17.425
I had a son that I loved
die before his time.

09:17.516 --> 09:19.632
I tried to replace him
with your Charming.

09:19.727 --> 09:21.683
Offered him the world.

09:21.770 --> 09:23.101
But he rejected me.

09:23.188 --> 09:25.270
Humiliated me in front of my kingdom.

09:25.357 --> 09:27.439
All for the sake of true love.

09:27.776 --> 09:29.937
Something about which
you know nothing.

09:30.779 --> 09:32.394
I know more than you think.

09:34.116 --> 09:36.823
You were in love?

09:37.119 --> 09:38.484
Yes.

09:39.246 --> 09:40.827
And she loved me.

09:41.373 --> 09:42.783
We were happy.

09:42.875 --> 09:44.456
Blissful.

09:45.294 --> 09:47.159
But then she became cursed.

09:47.713 --> 09:52.377
She drank a vile potion that made it
impossible for us to conceive a child.

09:52.968 --> 09:55.129
Family is everything, my dear.

09:55.846 --> 09:57.882
Losing all hope of having one?

09:58.682 --> 10:00.388
There is no greater misery.

10:01.268 --> 10:03.680
Charming could have been
that hope for me.

10:03.771 --> 10:06.433
But, instead, he made
my suffering worse.

You can tell me anything, Snow.

23:19.816 --> 23:20.931
It's the King.

23:21.317 --> 23:24.354
When he captured me, he cursed me

23:28.658 --> 23:31.616
so that I can never have children.

23:32.787 --> 23:34.197
Worry not.

23:34.330 --> 23:37.447
If the water from Lake Nostos
can heal me,

23:37.542 --> 23:39.282
it should be able to do the same for you.

23:41.170 --> 23:42.546
Do you really think so?

23:43.047 --> 23:47.666
You are going to be a wonderful mother.

23:50.179 --> 23:51.680

Aurora, you've got to keep up.

23:55.852 --> 23:59.185
Sorry, but I'm not exactly dressed
for the woods. It's cold out here.

23:59.814 --> 24:02.897
Then maybe you should have listened
to me and stayed back.

24:03.026 --> 24:04.357
Here.

24:06.404 --> 24:08.110
But I tried to kill your friend.

24:08.197 --> 24:09.482
Actually, she's my mom.

24:09.574 --> 24:11.986
I have a feeling
she can take care of herself.

24:12.076 --> 24:15.739
And I get it. You're not the only one
who's been screwing up lately.

24:16.748 --> 24:18.204
What kind of corset is this?

24:18.291 --> 24:19.280
MULAN: Up here!

24:21.753 --> 24:22.868

You all right?

26:33.342 --> 26:36.926
Yeah. How did you know
I was down here?

26:37.013 --> 26:39.220
Your mom said you asked her to lunch.

26:39.348 --> 26:41.213
And when you stood her up,

26:41.350 --> 26:43.341
she checked her office,
saw her keys missing.

26:43.478 --> 26:44.684
Figured out the rest.

26:44.812 --> 26:47.804
She would have come herself,
but she didn't think you'd go with her.

26:47.899 --> 26:50.641
Henry, what were you thinking?

26:50.735 --> 26:52.396
Ijust want them back.

26:52.528 --> 26:54.689
It wasn't supposed to be this way.

26:54.822 --> 26:57.029
I should be over there with them.

Riding horses,
learning how to sword fight.

There may yet be water.

28:02.557 --> 28:03.967
It's just enough for one sip.

28:07.103 --> 28:08.309
We shall find out.

I want you to have it.
That last sip of water,

No.

28:38.134 --> 28:41.592
Maybe it's for the best.
I was raised without a mother.

28:42.513 --> 28:46.802

And you never got to do any of it.

30:20.778 --> 30:22.814
We never got to be a family.

30:22.905 --> 30:25.738
We have a family, in Storybrooke.

30:26.701 --> 30:29.033
And right now,
they need us to get back there.

30:30.037 --> 30:33.746

does a disgraced member

still have the power

to enough magic to make it work again.

33:25.713 --> 33:27.578
The portal you were after?

33:27.715 --> 33:28.955
The same one Emma went through.

This belonged to her.
She would have wanted you to have it.

36:07.082 --> 36:09.869
She said that it could tell you
what your child would be.

36:09.960 --> 36:11.166
Please don't.

36:11.253 --> 36:12.754
It's just a superstition.

36:38.822 --> 36:40.562
It's gonna be a boy, right?

36:40.657 --> 36:43.444
I can never remember
which direction means what.

36:44.578 --> 36:46.114
It's a surprise.

36:48.457 --> 36:50.322
I'll send the signal
for the army to regroup.

36:50.959 --> 36:53.120
We are gonna take back
the kingdom, Snow.

36:53.253 --> 36:56.165

37:22.282 --> 37:24.113
This is because of you, isn't it?

37:25.994 --> 37:28.781
Ruth only pretended to drink the water.

37:28.872 --> 37:32.456
She had you put it in the wedding
chalice so I would drink it.

37:33.001 --> 37:36.209
That's how King George's curse
was broken, wasn't it?

37:36.713 --> 37:39.796
I have no idea what you're talking about.

37:41.343 --> 37:44.176
So what's your child going to be?

37:47.975 --> 37:49.010
A girl.

37:53.647 --> 37:56.764
Lancelot was one of the most
noble knights I ever knew.

37:56.859 --> 37:58.065
How could I be so blind?

37:58.360 --> 38:00.271
How could I not see that it was Cora?

38:00.362 --> 38:02.944
Well, to be fair, the whole
shape shifting thing threw me, too.

38:03.198 --> 38:04.654
What are we going to tell
the people on the island?

38:04.741 --> 38:05.776
SNOW WHITE: The truth.

38:05.868 --> 38:08.359
That Lancelot was cut down
by a terrible villain.

38:08.454 --> 38:10.445
He died an honorable death.

38:10.539 --> 38:11.779
Cora's still out there.

38:12.124 --> 38:14.706
We need to find her. We need
to defend what's left of the kingdom.

38:14.793 --> 38:16.875
Who's going to lead us? You?

38:17.629 --> 38:20.006
No.Heh

38:25.220 --> 38:26.721
I'm honored.

38:27.222 --> 38:29.304
But Emma and I still have to find
a way back to Storybrooke.

38:29.391 --> 38:30.380
MULAN: We'll help you.

38:30.476 --> 38:32.558
We'll find a way, won't we?

38:33.312 --> 38:34.347
Yes.

38:36.190 --> 38:38.306
Perhaps it'll help me channel my anger.

38:40.360 --> 38:41.349
Come.

38:43.530 --> 38:47.819
I'm, uh, sorry I torched our ride home.

38:47.910 --> 38:49.741
I couldn't let her get to Henry. Ijust...

38:49.870 --> 38:52.077
You had to put Henry first.

38:54.750 --> 38:56.911
I was angry at you for so long.

39:00.255 --> 39:04.840
Wondering how you could choose
to let me grow up without you.

39:06.595 --> 39:08.586
But then, just seeing all this,

39:09.932 --> 39:14.175
you gave up everything for me.

39:14.937 --> 39:17.098
And you're still doing that.

39:18.690 --> 39:20.851
I'm sorry, I'm not good at this. I...

39:21.652 --> 39:23.267
I guess Ijust...

39:24.780 --> 39:27.692
(CRYING) I'm not...
I'm not used to someone putting me first.

39:29.660 --> 39:30.649
Oh.

39:33.789 --> 39:35.029
(SIGHS)

39:35.582 --> 39:37.197
Well, get used to it.

39:37.292 --> 39:38.498
(LAUGHS)

40:02.609 --> 40:04.474
(BABY LAUGHS FAINTLY)

40:47.696 --> 40:48.936
(LAUGHS)

40:55.787 --> 40:57.368
JEFFERSON: Grace?

41:04.630 --> 41:06.166
Papa!

41:07.507 --> 41:08.496
(SNIFFLES)

41:08.675 --> 41:10.961
You found me. I knew you would.

41:32.783 --> 41:34.694
I've been thinking.

41:34.785 --> 41:38.403
If you're gonna start helping me,
we got to make sure we do this right.

41:39.456 --> 41:42.698
So I picked these up on my way home.

41:42.793 --> 41:43.953
Seriously?

41:44.044 --> 41:45.830
Yeah, you're the grandson of a prince.

41:46.254 --> 41:48.745
I think it's about time
you learned how to use a sword.

41:49.841 --> 41:53.208
Henry, I can't get them back without you.

41:54.554 --> 41:57.421
So, what do you say? You with me?

41:57.849 --> 41:59.635
Can you teach me
how to fight a dragon?

42:00.769 --> 42:02.634
We'll work our way up to it.

42:07.067 --> 42:08.682
My liege.

42:09.444 --> 42:10.854
En garde!

42:10.946 --> 42:12.106
(LAUGHS)

42:12.197 --> 42:14.984
Hey! Come over here. Up top.

42:15.784 --> 42:17.445
-Oh!
-(GRUNTS)

42:17.703 --> 42:19.489
Ah, you wanna fight on the same level.

42:19.788 --> 42:20.868
HENRY: Yes.
