<i>Most of the times, it isn't the
choice itself that's stressful,</i>

00:37.130 --> 00:39.493
<i>but rather the consequence
of the choice,</i>

00:39.700 --> 00:41.477

00:42.228 --> 00:44.348

00:58.434 --> 01:00.706

when we made our choices...</i>

01:03.912 --> 01:06.392
<i>...having realized
we made the wrong ones,</i>

01:07.088 --> 01:08.919
<i>there was some way to go back,</i>

01:09.254 --> 01:11.992
<i>some way to invoke
a kind of big do-over.</i>

01:12.111 --> 01:13.855
<i>You know what I mean?</i>

01:16.486 --> 01:18.182
<i>Wouldn't that be great?</i>

01:21.830 --> 01:23.818
<i>Wouldn't that just be the best?</i>

01:31.471 --> 01:32.367
You okay?

01:33.407 --> 01:34.488
Everything all right?

01:34.623 --> 01:35.403
Mm-hmm.

01:36.383 --> 01:38.590
I'm fine; I just had a dream.

01:46.685 --> 01:47.901
What are you doing?

01:48.956 --> 01:50.469
You know what
I'm doing.

01:51.412 --> 01:55.259
Well, I don't feel like
doing that right now.

01:55.372 --> 01:57.674
That's okay, I'll
do all the work.

02:02.314 --> 02:03.615
(chuckling):
That...

02:03.769 --> 02:05.369
that is not the
look of love.

02:06.593 --> 02:07.849
What's your problem?

02:07.946 --> 02:09.032
What are you
talking about?

02:09.090 --> 02:10.481
I don't have a
problem, I just...

02:11.536 --> 02:13.073
I just figured
that you're up

02:13.649 --> 02:14.649
and I'm up...

02:14.752 --> 02:15.809
I know.

02:16.017 --> 02:17.231
It's been a while.

02:17.759 --> 02:19.855
Well, I'm not going
to forget how to do it.

02:20.032 --> 02:22.352
It's just I'm tired,
honey, I'm cranky.

02:22.494 --> 02:23.439
Yeah...

02:23.528 --> 02:26.079
Tomorrow,
I promise tomorrow.

02:26.662 --> 02:29.031
Yeah, you say that, but
it's a vicious cycle.

02:29.969 --> 02:31.863
Let me explain
something to you.

02:32.133 --> 02:34.486
Sex isn't just sex.

02:34.569 --> 02:36.642
Sex is good for you,

02:36.729 --> 02:39.599
'cause sex releases
endorphins.

02:40.571 --> 02:42.564
And endorphins
make you happy.

02:42.668 --> 02:43.658
Mmm.

02:44.020 --> 02:45.739
Yes. I know that, I do.

02:45.852 --> 02:49.507
And I fully plan on
being happy tomorrow,

02:50.026 --> 02:51.683
whether I feel like it
or not.

03:37.210 --> 03:39.017
Girls, breakfast is ready!

03:42.311 --> 03:43.159
Where is your sister?

03:43.831 --> 03:46.008
Ariel says she's not going
to school today.

03:46.367 --> 03:47.135
Why not?

03:47.329 --> 03:48.673
I don't know; ask her.

03:49.807 --> 03:51.591
Ariel? I need to speak with you!

03:51.800 --> 03:53.127
I'm here, I'm
here, I'm here...

03:53.446 --> 03:54.934
but I'm not going
to school today.

03:55.198 --> 03:56.039
Oh, really?

03:56.590 --> 03:57.701
You can't make me go.

03:57.887 --> 03:59.014
Oh, yeah, I can;
I'm your mother.

03:59.110 --> 04:01.191
They gave me permission
at the hospital when I had you.

04:01.284 --> 04:02.556
Mom, I have to stay home,

04:02.662 --> 04:04.365
or Amy Amson
is going to beat me up.

04:04.517 --> 04:06.093
Wait a second-- who's Amy Amson?

04:06.349 --> 04:08.052
She's this girl
in my biology class.

04:08.133 --> 04:09.848
Somebody passed her
this note by mistake,

04:09.925 --> 04:11.548
and I guess the boys wrote it.

04:11.748 --> 04:13.764
Um, it's a list of who's hot
and who's not,

04:13.846 --> 04:15.276
and according to them, I'm hot,

04:15.379 --> 04:16.892
and according to them,
she's not.

04:16.981 --> 04:21.153
So Hannah says she says that
she's going to mess my face up

04:21.250 --> 04:23.429
today before Biology,
so I'm not hot anymore.

04:23.530 --> 04:25.226
<i>Somebody thinks you're hot?</i>

04:25.398 --> 04:28.384
I thought you had to be smart
to get into eighth grade.

04:28.809 --> 04:30.793
And you actually think
this is going to happen?

04:31.657 --> 04:33.793
If you stay home today,
what do you do tomorrow?

04:34.256 --> 04:35.393
(chuckling):
Tomorrow's Saturday.

04:35.553 --> 04:36.990
No, you know what
I'm talking about.

04:37.146 --> 04:38.584
You know what this is?

04:38.695 --> 04:40.827
This is a vicious cycle,
that's what it is.

04:40.898 --> 04:42.104
And you know what
we have to do?

04:42.251 --> 04:43.346
You have to go to school.

04:43.503 --> 04:45.686
You have to show this girl

04:45.727 --> 04:47.342
that you are not
going to be intimidated,

04:47.407 --> 04:50.462
and I can almost guarantee you,
nothing is going to happen.

04:50.621 --> 04:52.592
Did I hear someone mention
a vicious cycle?

04:52.695 --> 04:54.749
There's a lot of that
going around lately.

04:54.853 --> 04:56.723
Daddy, please,
I have to stay home.

04:57.388 --> 04:59.644
This is really a matter
of life and death.

05:00.907 --> 05:02.748
(sighs)
Sounds like it's going
to be a rough morning.

05:03.067 --> 05:05.099
Bet you wish you
had some endorphins
right about now.

05:06.851 --> 05:09.046
I'm sorry, Ariel, staying home
is not the answer.

05:09.162 --> 05:11.203
I've got an important
arraignment at work today,

05:11.810 --> 05:13.635
and you can't stay here
by yourself.

05:14.017 --> 05:15.322
BRIDGETTE:
What's an arraignment?

05:15.433 --> 05:17.082
Okay, fine, but
you are responsible

05:17.122 --> 05:18.289
for whatever
happens to me.

05:18.369 --> 05:19.833
If I die...
You're not
going to die.

05:19.888 --> 05:20.993
Nothing's going to happen.

05:21.079 --> 05:22.240
What's an arraignment?

05:22.355 --> 05:23.223
We'll see.

05:24.872 --> 05:25.560
We'll see.

05:25.673 --> 05:28.767
Will somebody please tell me
what an arraignment is?!

05:28.880 --> 05:30.823
I believe our middle child
has a question for you.

05:31.311 --> 05:34.022
An arraignment.
An arraignment is what happens

05:34.079 --> 05:35.838
when someone is being accused
of a crime.

05:36.135 --> 05:37.671
Before there's a trial
or anything,

05:37.735 --> 05:38.773
they go down to court...

05:38.917 --> 05:40.030
(phone rings)
and the court tells them

05:40.112 --> 05:43.138
what they're being accused of,
and they tell the court

05:43.235 --> 05:44.959
if they believe they're innocent
or guilty.
JOE:
Hello?

05:45.295 --> 05:47.822
But why would anybody
say they're guilty?
Who's calling?

05:48.210 --> 05:49.711
Well, that's a very
good question.

05:49.751 --> 05:51.359
They want to speak
to a Mrs. Dubois.

05:51.423 --> 05:53.277
They won't take "no"
for an answer...

05:53.637 --> 05:54.508
Hello?

05:54.725 --> 05:55.628
No.

05:55.724 --> 05:58.485
I'm not interested in having
my carpets and drapes cleaned.

05:58.844 --> 05:59.636
No.

05:59.749 --> 06:02.156
I don't want a free
in-home estimate.

06:02.788 --> 06:04.467
No, you don't have to call back
in three months

06:04.556 --> 06:06.571
for a follow-up.
Thank you.
Oops.

06:06.900 --> 06:08.100
Oh, great.

06:09.852 --> 06:11.795
This is turning out to be
a wonderful day.

06:12.290 --> 06:13.323
Don't blame me.

06:13.442 --> 06:15.390
I offered, you passed.

06:17.405 --> 06:18.325
Sorry to bother you.

06:18.429 --> 06:19.812
I was going over
these crime scene photos

06:19.882 --> 06:20.893
from the Krieger case.

06:20.980 --> 06:22.460
I think I may
have found something.

06:22.564 --> 06:23.679
Why are you showing me this?

06:23.766 --> 06:26.044
Well, just... I think Krieger
may have had some help.

06:26.131 --> 06:27.851
I don't think he killed
these people by himself.

06:27.954 --> 06:29.161
Well, that's all well
and good, Allison,

06:29.187 --> 06:30.357
but we're not even sure
we're going to trial

06:30.438 --> 06:31.492
on the Krieger case yet.

06:31.559 --> 06:33.325
It's only being arraigned
this afternoon...

06:33.469 --> 06:34.778
I know, I just thought...
The truth is,

06:34.873 --> 06:36.898
I have a hunch this one
won't even make it to court.

06:36.994 --> 06:38.617
The defense lawyer
has already pushed

06:38.698 --> 06:39.633
the arraignment
date four times,

06:39.713 --> 06:41.722
which makes me think they're
having second thoughts.

06:41.844 --> 06:43.074
I think they're going to
come in this afternoon,

06:43.154 --> 06:45.299
simply plead guilty
and make a deal.

06:47.184 --> 06:48.122
Excuse me.

06:50.718 --> 06:51.551
Hello.

06:51.655 --> 06:52.679
Mrs. Dubois.

06:52.792 --> 06:55.368
This is Nurse Dunbar down
at Central Middle School?

06:56.110 --> 06:57.670
I've got Ariel here,

06:57.750 --> 06:59.966
and she's telling me
she's feeling pretty ill.

07:00.173 --> 07:01.415
What was I going to do, Joe?

07:01.494 --> 07:03.237
She obviously didn't want
to be there.

07:03.349 --> 07:05.309
She was obviously scared
out of her mind.

07:05.557 --> 07:07.949
So I told the nurse I'd be there
in, like, 45 minutes.

07:09.092 --> 07:10.213
I don't know.

07:11.684 --> 07:13.594
It's like 12:30 now.

07:13.687 --> 07:15.341
I just figured
I'd try to rush her home,

07:15.419 --> 07:16.803
and get back...

07:43.630 --> 07:46.087
BRIDGETTE:
Daddy, I think
I see her eyes moving.

07:46.375 --> 07:47.750
Darling? Hey.

07:48.960 --> 07:49.935
Hey.

07:50.558 --> 07:51.545
Are you awake?

07:52.262 --> 07:53.367
Do you see us?

07:54.589 --> 07:56.804
Hey, you got a lot of
drugs in you, baby.

07:58.285 --> 07:59.764
Your-your face is
all stitched up,

07:59.870 --> 08:01.484
so they don't
want you to speak.

08:02.412 --> 08:05.220
You just blink once if
you know we're here, okay?

08:07.882 --> 08:10.059
Mommy, this is all my fault.

08:10.395 --> 08:12.553
If I hadn't gone
to the nurse's office,

08:12.660 --> 08:14.322
this would have never happened.

08:14.426 --> 08:16.386
Sweetie, sweetie,
sweetie.

08:16.512 --> 08:18.434
(sobbing)
Ariel, honey.

08:18.773 --> 08:20.993
No, no, no,
sweetie, sweetie.

08:21.409 --> 08:23.263
We talked about this,
we talked about this.

08:23.338 --> 08:25.393
You know that's
not true, okay?

08:25.601 --> 08:26.937
You know that's
not true.

08:28.448 --> 08:29.967
Your mom is
going to be fine.

08:30.052 --> 08:31.383
She's going
to be okay.

08:32.177 --> 08:33.327
Sweetie, I
need you to go

08:33.400 --> 08:36.062
to the vending machines
in the cafeteria. Okay?

08:36.202 --> 08:37.663
You need to take your
sister down there.

08:38.134 --> 08:40.477
I need to talk to Mommy
for a second, okay?

08:40.895 --> 08:42.076
Go on.

08:42.957 --> 08:44.420
Go with your sister.

08:45.742 --> 08:49.649
Mommy, I'm so sorry.

08:59.164 --> 09:00.240
Hey.

09:04.381 --> 09:07.363
Everyone's calling
to make sure you're okay--

09:08.355 --> 09:10.204
everyone from work
and your brother,

09:11.658 --> 09:12.955
the district attorney.

09:13.035 --> 09:14.331
He wanted me to tell you

09:14.394 --> 09:16.553
that the arraignment went fine,
by the way.

09:19.458 --> 09:21.161
I don't know what you remember.

09:21.785 --> 09:23.161
I don't know what you know.

09:24.577 --> 09:25.561
(sighing):
Um...

09:28.888 --> 09:31.717
This asshole went
right through the light,

09:33.071 --> 09:34.494
He just went right through it.

09:35.373 --> 09:37.957
Like 40 miles an hour.

09:39.292 --> 09:40.685
Maybe he was high or something.

09:40.780 --> 09:41.749
I don't know.

09:41.877 --> 09:43.285
Nobody's telling me anything.

09:45.820 --> 09:48.740
<i>I do know--
here's the good news.</i>

09:51.059 --> 09:53.274
Here's the cosmic joke
in all this.

09:54.026 --> 09:57.267
There was a body
in the trunk of his car.

09:58.089 --> 09:59.387
A body.

09:59.547 --> 10:01.560
And a blue duffle bag
filled with ammo

10:01.585 --> 10:02.913
and an automatic weapon,

10:02.938 --> 10:05.856
and blueprints for some
building downtown, so...

10:06.714 --> 10:08.024
I mean,
we're all reasonably sure

10:08.079 --> 10:11.255
that he wasn't rushing
to church, you know?

10:13.607 --> 10:15.255
That's my wife,

10:15.359 --> 10:17.678
always out there
stopping the bad guys,

10:18.159 --> 10:18.846
even when she...

10:19.918 --> 10:22.087
(chuckling):
even when doesn't know
that she's doing it.

10:26.494 --> 10:27.789
Here's the thing.

10:30.126 --> 10:31.980
You got hurt really bad.

10:33.917 --> 10:37.013
Nothing that can't be fixed
with time and with therapy.

10:40.915 --> 10:42.550
Okay, this is ridiculous,

10:42.628 --> 10:44.489
'cause they told me
not to say anything.

10:46.712 --> 10:49.557
Not until you
were fully conscious

10:49.670 --> 10:51.389
and they had weaned you
off the drugs.

10:51.998 --> 10:55.045
I guess they're right...
I guess they're right.

11:00.212 --> 11:01.731
Just know that...

11:02.036 --> 11:04.156
that, you know,
we're going to...

11:05.276 --> 11:07.475
we're going to get you
everything you need.

11:09.066 --> 11:12.707
Whatever it is,
whatever it costs.

11:16.825 --> 11:18.184
I love you, baby.

11:26.377 --> 11:28.240
I love you.

11:54.091 --> 11:55.331
Nurse.

11:56.211 --> 11:57.883
Nurse!

12:00.026 --> 12:01.186
I have to go to the bathroom.

12:01.251 --> 12:02.371
Is that the bathroom?

12:02.505 --> 12:05.601
I have to go to the bathroom,
but I can't feel my legs.

12:05.700 --> 12:06.522
Let me get
some help.

12:06.561 --> 12:07.680
No, no, no,
we don't need any help.

12:07.758 --> 12:08.753
You and I can do it.

12:09.330 --> 12:11.296
My legs are asleep.

12:11.913 --> 12:14.628
(screaming):
Oh, my God!

12:14.940 --> 12:15.715
Uh...

12:15.810 --> 12:18.763
Where are my legs?!
Where are my legs?!

12:35.545 --> 12:36.329
You okay?

12:36.474 --> 12:37.784
Oh, man.

12:38.760 --> 12:41.295
I had the most
horrible nightmare.

12:42.703 --> 12:44.247
I dreamt I totaled our car.

12:44.336 --> 12:45.958
I lost both my legs.

12:46.102 --> 12:47.599
It was so vivid.

12:48.933 --> 12:49.790
Cool.

12:49.894 --> 12:52.734
The kids don't get up
for another ten minutes.

12:52.918 --> 12:53.654
Oh, man.

12:53.709 --> 12:55.564
I so believed
what I was dreaming.

12:56.526 --> 12:57.837
I'm so relieved.

12:59.005 --> 13:00.299
I feel like I...

13:01.396 --> 13:03.528
I got the ultimate do-over,

13:03.649 --> 13:07.146
like the universe gave me
a get-out-of-jail-free card.

13:08.800 --> 13:10.990
Um, well, did you
use that card yet?

13:11.038 --> 13:12.875
Because I was
thinking that,

13:12.959 --> 13:17.621
if you're still in jail, I could
really go for a conjugal visit.

13:19.821 --> 13:21.701
Come on.
Don't look at
me that way.

13:23.213 --> 13:24.875
Let me explain
something to you.

13:25.020 --> 13:26.925
Sex isn't just sex.

13:27.004 --> 13:28.236
Sex is good for you.

13:28.396 --> 13:30.380
Sex releases
endorphins.

13:30.461 --> 13:32.674
And endorphins
make you happy.

13:33.691 --> 13:35.626
And right now, you look
like you could use

13:35.764 --> 13:37.186
a little happiness.

13:38.010 --> 13:39.578
I sure know I could.

13:42.497 --> 13:43.970
Girls, breakfast!

13:46.936 --> 13:49.681
Mommy, can't I
have oatmeal?

13:49.824 --> 13:50.473
Not this morning.

13:50.576 --> 13:52.456
We're behind schedule,
this is faster.

13:52.728 --> 13:54.447
Tread gently with
Mommy, Bridge.

13:54.704 --> 13:56.911
The woman's in dire need
of some endorphins.

13:57.350 --> 13:58.712
Hmm?
ALLISON:
Where's Ariel?

13:58.800 --> 13:59.600
We got to get move on.

13:59.679 --> 14:00.675
I got to get to work.

14:00.815 --> 14:01.991
Got an arraignment today.

14:02.222 --> 14:03.558
What's an arraignment?

14:03.718 --> 14:04.813
Ariel!

14:04.974 --> 14:06.253
What's an arraignment?

14:06.351 --> 14:07.246
Where's your sister?

14:07.351 --> 14:08.694
Why is she not here?

14:08.838 --> 14:10.877
Ariel says she doesn't
want to go to school today.

14:10.998 --> 14:12.501
What's an arraignment?

14:17.356 --> 14:19.922
Why do you want to know
what an arraignment is?
You're only eight.

14:20.247 --> 14:21.922
I don't know.

14:22.132 --> 14:23.356
ARIEL:
I'm here, I'm here,
I'm here.

14:23.380 --> 14:24.755
But I'm not
going to school.

14:27.850 --> 14:29.314
Is this about Amy Amson?

14:29.363 --> 14:31.985
You're on the hot list,
she's not on the hot list?

14:32.091 --> 14:33.920
That's so unfair
you can do that.

14:34.012 --> 14:35.729
That is so cool
that you can do that.

14:35.768 --> 14:37.569
What's everybody talking about?

14:37.688 --> 14:38.809
What's she doing?

14:43.834 --> 14:44.945
You want me to get that?

14:48.639 --> 14:49.463
Hello?

14:50.472 --> 14:51.990
May I ask who's calling?

14:52.088 --> 14:53.071
ARIEL:
Mom, this isn't funny.

14:53.151 --> 14:55.160
It's really important
that I stay home.

14:55.486 --> 14:57.494
They want to talk
to a Mrs. Allison Dubois,

14:57.574 --> 14:59.679
and they won't say
what it's about.

15:00.807 --> 15:01.574
Hello?

15:01.688 --> 15:02.989
MAN:
Mrs. Dubois, this is

15:03.097 --> 15:04.677
All Right Carpet
Cleaning Service.

15:04.758 --> 15:05.701
I'm calling to offer you

15:05.781 --> 15:07.049
a special half-off...
ARIEL:
Bridget!

15:07.205 --> 15:08.077
Oops.

15:08.192 --> 15:09.765
This is the same exact day.

15:09.870 --> 15:11.203
Is that a yes?
JOE:
Ariel, here, take this.

15:11.339 --> 15:12.651
Because for $19.95 an hour,

15:12.746 --> 15:14.098
we can send a team
of professionals

15:14.163 --> 15:16.485
to your house
to clean your carpets...

15:18.308 --> 15:19.358
Here.

15:21.298 --> 15:22.185
I dreamt this.

15:22.265 --> 15:23.621
I dreamt this whole morning.

15:23.785 --> 15:25.985
Everything-- the juice,
the phone call,

15:26.474 --> 15:28.640
Ariel wanting to stay
home from school.

15:29.091 --> 15:30.706
Uh, okay. So?

15:30.833 --> 15:31.881
Everything.

15:32.275 --> 15:34.223
It's as if I lived
this day already.

15:35.000 --> 15:38.059
And I'm gonna get in a horrible
car accident in a little while.

15:38.511 --> 15:39.272
You're what?

15:39.378 --> 15:40.511
No, wait, wait.

15:41.531 --> 15:43.292
I had that dream for a reason.

15:44.106 --> 15:45.794
I can stop this from happening.

15:51.136 --> 15:52.028
Hello.

15:52.767 --> 15:53.559
Good morning, yeah.

15:53.622 --> 15:55.532
Is Detective Lee Scanlon in yet?

15:56.838 --> 15:58.711
Can I leave him a message?

15:59.150 --> 16:00.103
My name's Allison Dubois.

16:00.240 --> 16:01.534
Can you tell him
to meet me at the corner

16:01.613 --> 16:03.759
of Mesa and Pueblo at 12:30?

16:05.084 --> 16:06.173
Tell him
to look out for me.

16:06.237 --> 16:07.548
I'll be taking a cab.

16:08.237 --> 16:10.692
Mom, can I please
stay home from school?

16:11.244 --> 16:12.698
No. No, you cannot.

16:13.135 --> 16:15.134
And don't you dare
go to the nurse's office

16:15.198 --> 16:16.352
and make me come and get you.

16:16.399 --> 16:18.206
You will be grounded
the rest of eighth grade.

16:20.686 --> 16:22.165
Endorphins.

16:25.739 --> 16:26.763
Just so you know,
I was supposed to

16:26.861 --> 16:28.915
have lunch with a certain
someone who works for the Mayor.

16:29.172 --> 16:31.050
You may have to vouch for me
at a later date.

16:31.171 --> 16:32.730
Consider yourself vouched.

16:32.845 --> 16:34.027
Now, what is it
we're looking for?

16:34.194 --> 16:35.881
In about one minute, a
man's gonna go through

16:35.945 --> 16:37.474
this traffic signal.

16:37.584 --> 16:39.105
There'll be a dead man
in the trunk of his car,

16:39.184 --> 16:42.712
along with about 100 rounds
of ammo, automatic weapon,

16:42.792 --> 16:45.512
not to mention blueprints
to a building downtown.

16:45.873 --> 16:47.616
If I'd driven
myself here today,

16:47.752 --> 16:50.087
I believe that he would've been
fated to run through the light

16:50.152 --> 16:51.543
and hit me with his car.

16:51.672 --> 16:53.263
But since I got
here early by cab,

16:54.104 --> 16:55.886
my hope is that he will
go through the light

16:55.919 --> 16:58.439
without incident, you will
arrest him and prevent him

16:58.494 --> 17:01.024
from whatever awful thing he
was bound and determined to do.

17:01.108 --> 17:02.021
You with me?

17:02.084 --> 17:03.612
And you know this
because...?

17:03.700 --> 17:05.763
Because of the wonderful
things she does.

17:06.124 --> 17:07.595
That traffic light
right there?

17:08.688 --> 17:10.986
That light there.
Black sedan.

17:12.178 --> 17:13.247
Like that one.

17:13.392 --> 17:15.587
Oh, boy, I get to use my siren.

17:31.618 --> 17:32.541
Wait here.

17:46.603 --> 17:48.225
Well, this is
embarrassing.

17:49.009 --> 17:51.122
I ran a red light
back there, didn't I?

17:51.266 --> 17:52.473
You certainly did.

17:52.529 --> 17:53.913
Your Honor.

18:15.143 --> 18:16.598
I don't understand.

18:19.973 --> 18:20.854
I don't know
what to tell you.

18:20.909 --> 18:21.814
It's pretty
cut and dried.

18:21.856 --> 18:24.252
I just pulled over a
Federal Court Judge.

18:24.421 --> 18:25.685
A Federal Court Judge.

18:25.740 --> 18:27.373
The Honorable
James T. Whitman.

18:27.493 --> 18:29.284
Nice fellow,
crappy golfer.

18:29.396 --> 18:30.307
What about his trunk?

18:30.370 --> 18:31.948
I didn't see you
look in his trunk.

18:32.109 --> 18:33.955
That's 'cause I didn't
look in his trunk, Allison.

18:34.019 --> 18:35.244
He's a Federal
Court Judge.

18:35.308 --> 18:37.465
What part of Federal Court
Judge don't you understand?

18:37.571 --> 18:39.226
I'm not about to ask that
man to open his trunk

18:39.282 --> 18:40.842
when I have no
probable cause.

18:41.314 --> 18:42.257
The last time
I checked,

18:42.331 --> 18:44.336
your dreams do not
constitute probable cause.

18:54.113 --> 18:55.592
You want some lunch?

18:55.847 --> 18:57.192
I'll buy you lunch.

19:05.598 --> 19:06.601
Hello?

19:06.696 --> 19:09.044
This is Nurse Dunbar
down at Central Middle School.

19:09.165 --> 19:11.125
I've got Ariel here,

19:11.252 --> 19:13.659
and, please
don't be alarmed,

19:13.763 --> 19:15.653
but another child
here at the school

19:15.708 --> 19:18.085
has apparently given
Ariel a black eye.

19:18.172 --> 19:19.380
A black eye?

19:19.516 --> 19:20.710
We've got some ice on it,

19:20.748 --> 19:22.028
and I'm sure
in an hour or so

19:22.067 --> 19:23.578
she'll be fine
to return to class.

19:23.892 --> 19:25.057
Oh, my God,
this is horrible.

19:25.120 --> 19:26.737
Is she okay?
Can I talk to her?

19:30.160 --> 19:34.101
Um, actually, um, she's laying
down at the moment, Mrs. Dubois.

19:34.402 --> 19:37.147
MAN (over radio):
All units in the vicinity...
I want to come pick her up.
Tell her I'll be right there.

19:37.419 --> 19:38.202
Thank you.

19:38.402 --> 19:39.970
...reporting a possible
hostage situation

19:40.006 --> 19:41.249
at the Florenzo Ristorante.

19:41.329 --> 19:42.858
I'm afraid you're not
going anywhere soon.

19:49.801 --> 19:50.529
I was in the
neighborhood,

19:50.649 --> 19:51.687
I heard you guys
were up to no good.

19:51.744 --> 19:53.417
JACKSON:
Well, somebody's
up to no good.

19:53.704 --> 19:54.897
About 35 minutes ago,

19:54.977 --> 19:57.176
911 got a call from inside
the restaurant about a robbery.

19:57.232 --> 20:00.039
When the first
responding officer arrived,

20:00.094 --> 20:01.519
the perpetrator
was still inside.

20:01.678 --> 20:04.103
He's holed up in there
with 57 hostages.

20:04.242 --> 20:05.261
How many?

20:05.431 --> 20:07.846
I've got sharpshooters on
all the surrounding rooftops.

20:08.070 --> 20:10.231
And the hostage negotiator
just got off the phone.

20:10.389 --> 20:12.182
What's he want?
What's he asking for?

20:12.269 --> 20:13.309
That's the fun part.

20:13.453 --> 20:14.485
He wants nothing.

20:14.525 --> 20:16.318
He's made no real demands.

20:16.413 --> 20:18.420
Just wants us to wait out here
till 5:00 p.m.

20:18.460 --> 20:20.588
Then he'll release the hostages
and give back the money.

20:20.900 --> 20:22.545
That makes no sense.
Tell me about it.

20:22.608 --> 20:24.520
Excuse me, Captain Jackson,
could you follow me?

20:30.710 --> 20:32.085
Lee.

20:32.776 --> 20:34.246
Take a look at that.

20:35.341 --> 20:36.806
Is that who I think it is?

20:36.924 --> 20:38.598
Man, this guy's really
pushing his luck.

20:38.654 --> 20:40.111
A handicapped spot.

20:40.597 --> 20:41.717
I'm not imagining
it, right?

20:41.780 --> 20:43.788
That's that
judge's car.

20:45.077 --> 20:47.171
Well, I guess today
is not his lucky day.

20:47.811 --> 20:48.624
I don't know
what to do.

20:48.676 --> 20:49.594
I dreamt about
that car.

20:49.634 --> 20:52.483
Now that that car's here, I'd
kind of like to stay if I could.

20:52.921 --> 20:54.364
Let me go call
my husband.

21:02.530 --> 21:04.577
MAN (over radio):
Central Command,
this is Watchtower. Over.

21:04.864 --> 21:05.960
I'm on the northeast corner

21:06.049 --> 21:07.864
of the roof of
the adjacent building.

21:08.017 --> 21:10.440
From my vantage point, sir,
it appears someone is attempting

21:10.488 --> 21:13.271
to make their way out of the
rear entrance of the restaurant.

21:15.151 --> 21:15.912
It's a glass door,

21:15.991 --> 21:18.767
and I keep seeing them
approach it and then hesitate.

21:19.495 --> 21:20.975
To be honest, sir,
I don't know if I'm looking

21:21.054 --> 21:23.205
at a hostage
or the hostage taker.

21:23.798 --> 21:25.054
Can you describe him?

21:25.197 --> 21:27.494
Male, approximately
six-feet-tall,

21:27.621 --> 21:30.117
shirt and tie,
looks like he's got a mask on,

21:30.229 --> 21:32.500
carrying some kind of
blue gym bag.

21:33.436 --> 21:34.764
Judge Whitman.

21:35.292 --> 21:36.515
In my dream,

21:36.875 --> 21:39.388
there was a blue gym bag
in the trunk of the car,

21:39.460 --> 21:41.147
along with the body,
along with the ammo,

21:41.205 --> 21:42.523
along with
an automatic weapon.

21:42.653 --> 21:44.443
Sir, I stopped
a suspicious-looking person

21:44.498 --> 21:46.499
matching that description
earlier today.

21:47.271 --> 21:48.376
He comes through the door

21:48.442 --> 21:50.319
and gives you any reason
to believe he's anything

21:50.354 --> 21:52.827
other than a hostage,
shoot to immobilize.

21:54.337 --> 21:55.473
MAN (over radio):
Here he comes.

21:56.504 --> 21:58.320
He's out.
He's got a weapon.

21:59.120 --> 22:00.320
I'm taking my shot.

22:07.033 --> 22:09.002
He's down.
Repeat. Man is down.

22:09.117 --> 22:10.869
He's just outside the rear
of the building.

22:20.188 --> 22:20.978
Sir.

22:21.067 --> 22:23.307
I need you to
release your weapon.

22:32.394 --> 22:33.868
It's taped to him
or something.

22:51.531 --> 22:52.827
We shot the wrong guy.

22:59.916 --> 23:01.634
His-his gun jammed.

23:01.765 --> 23:03.010
It jammed.

23:04.129 --> 23:05.193
Judge Whitman...

23:05.681 --> 23:07.608
He taped this
gun to his hand, he...

23:07.722 --> 23:10.188
gave him that bag,
he pushed him out the back door.

23:10.273 --> 23:12.625
So he could leave out the front
with the rest of the hostages.

23:46.577 --> 23:48.495
Do you need help
deciding what to wear?

23:50.712 --> 23:53.400
It's clean.
It's absolutely clean.

23:54.167 --> 23:55.456
What day is today?

23:55.912 --> 23:57.296
Mmm. Friday.

23:57.807 --> 23:59.111
Thank God.

24:00.518 --> 24:02.438
Wait...
I feel a hackneyed phrase

24:02.494 --> 24:03.839
coming on.

24:04.630 --> 24:05.717
It passed.

24:06.550 --> 24:09.950
Okay, but why would a
federal judge do that?

24:10.070 --> 24:11.076
Rob a restaurant?

24:11.182 --> 24:12.989
Hold hostages?
I don't know.

24:13.092 --> 24:14.420
He's not doing it for the money.

24:14.508 --> 24:16.884
He sends the money out
with one of the hostages.

24:18.284 --> 24:19.924
Assuming any of this is real.

24:20.003 --> 24:21.308
Assuming any of this

24:21.403 --> 24:24.076
is actually going
to happen, I mean...

24:24.115 --> 24:25.700
it was just a dream.

24:26.946 --> 24:28.339
What?

24:28.505 --> 24:30.937
No, just... I love
that you said that.

24:30.994 --> 24:33.049
I mean, normally I'd
be the one to say that.

24:33.532 --> 24:34.577
Yeah.

24:34.681 --> 24:36.466
Well, it just occurred to me
when I woke up,

24:36.521 --> 24:39.594
when I realized that my jacket
wasn't covered with blood.

24:39.682 --> 24:41.929
None of what I had dreamt
had happened.

24:42.097 --> 24:44.287
I felt relief.
I still feel relief.

24:44.592 --> 24:46.577
Excellent.
Relief is good.

24:47.088 --> 24:47.965
You know,

24:48.011 --> 24:49.151
it's hard to explain it.

24:49.436 --> 24:53.018
Every time I dream the dream,
there are certain cues.

24:53.131 --> 24:55.719
There are certain things
that happen at the start.

24:55.799 --> 24:56.884
But this morning...

24:56.972 --> 24:58.305
the fact that
the kids aren't up,

24:58.363 --> 25:00.201
the fact that we're up early.

25:00.929 --> 25:02.475
This is different.

25:02.593 --> 25:04.922
Gee, we are up kind of early.

25:07.775 --> 25:10.175
Hey, here's a crazy idea.

25:11.799 --> 25:15.160
How about we go back
to bed and not sleep.

25:15.655 --> 25:16.792
Hmm?

25:20.558 --> 25:21.975
Was that a "no"?

25:22.030 --> 25:22.896
Yeah.

25:22.951 --> 25:23.725
No.

25:23.782 --> 25:25.070
But it's not why you think...
I just...

25:25.167 --> 25:26.517
I don't want
to have this conversation.

25:26.597 --> 25:27.794
Cool. Kill the
conversation.

25:27.860 --> 25:28.926
I'll race you
to the bedroom.
No.

25:28.980 --> 25:30.217
Change the conversation.

25:30.273 --> 25:31.647
I don't want to have it.

25:31.832 --> 25:32.479
Wait a second...

25:32.561 --> 25:34.104
which "it" don't
you want to have?

25:34.240 --> 25:35.208
Either "it."

25:35.287 --> 25:36.608
I don't want to have
the conversation.

25:36.687 --> 25:38.167
I don't want to have sex.
Allison,

25:38.203 --> 25:39.647
let me explain
something to you.

25:39.716 --> 25:40.941
Sex isn't just sex.

25:41.040 --> 25:42.358
Sex is good for you.

25:42.537 --> 25:44.406
Sex releases
endorphins.
(moans)

25:44.494 --> 25:46.827
And endorphins, they
make you happy.

25:46.878 --> 25:47.600
And right now,

25:47.711 --> 25:49.644
you look like you could
use a little happiness.

25:49.766 --> 25:50.846
I sure know

25:50.901 --> 25:52.624
I could.
Oh, my God.

25:53.013 --> 25:54.093
Guess what?

25:54.220 --> 25:55.897
Ariel doesn't want
to go to school today.

25:56.058 --> 25:56.750
How... ?

25:58.961 --> 26:00.734
You want to know what
an arraignment is?

26:00.815 --> 26:02.831
Huh?
Well, trust me, you will.

26:02.910 --> 26:04.476
Ariel, let's go.

26:04.532 --> 26:06.083
Let's get the show
on the road.

26:07.984 --> 26:09.571
Mom...
I know all about it.

26:09.635 --> 26:10.889
You're hot. She's not.

26:10.972 --> 26:13.699
But you're not staying home from
school because of some bully.

26:13.802 --> 26:16.666
The girl's got you completely
intimidated and that's crazy.

26:16.820 --> 26:18.109
You know what you have to do?

26:18.235 --> 26:19.649
Intimidate her.

26:19.737 --> 26:20.794
That's right, you have
to go to school

26:20.819 --> 26:22.261
with a little less of
that "I'm pretty,

26:22.313 --> 26:24.211
I'm smart, I'm
well-behaved" thing

26:24.390 --> 26:26.576
and get yourself
a little bit of

26:26.638 --> 26:27.671
badass!

26:27.760 --> 26:28.816
Mom!
Allison?

26:28.870 --> 26:30.237
You know what
I'm saying.
Don't pretend you don't know

26:30.273 --> 26:31.588
what I'm saying. Badass,

26:31.677 --> 26:34.490
badass, badass.

26:34.554 --> 26:36.386
You got to get yourself
a little attitude,

26:36.426 --> 26:38.082
Ariel Dubois,
and you got to give it

26:38.123 --> 26:39.177
to that girl.

26:39.305 --> 26:40.273
Joe, back me up here.

26:40.314 --> 26:41.258
Your father and I

26:41.345 --> 26:43.590
do not want you to spend
your whole life afraid

26:43.716 --> 26:44.890
some girl's going
to hit you.

26:48.009 --> 26:49.840
that you are going to hit her.

26:49.896 --> 26:51.023
JOE:
Hey.

26:51.063 --> 26:51.935
Are you okay?

26:51.975 --> 26:53.160
Do you follow what I'm saying?

26:53.225 --> 26:54.111
Attitude.

26:54.150 --> 26:55.447
I'm trying to
teach this girl

26:55.512 --> 26:56.327
something here.
(telephone rings)

26:56.383 --> 26:57.455
Here, look, follow.

26:57.517 --> 26:58.815
Watch this, okay.

26:58.855 --> 27:02.134
No!
No, no, no.

27:02.157 --> 27:04.149
No, you listen to me
you scum sucking,

27:04.180 --> 27:05.046
bottom-feeding,

27:05.102 --> 27:07.326
hide-behind-a-telephone-headset
piece of garbage.

27:07.365 --> 27:09.758
you ever call my house
again during breakfast,

27:09.821 --> 27:13.028
I will personally come to
your carpet cleaning company,

27:13.101 --> 27:15.628
I will find you and
I will hurt you.

27:15.684 --> 27:17.188
And when I'm
finished with you,

27:17.277 --> 27:19.228
nothing and no one
will ever be able to

27:19.292 --> 27:20.779
to get your stain out.

27:21.818 --> 27:23.363
Okay, you get the gist?

27:23.619 --> 27:24.425
All right.

27:24.659 --> 27:26.131
Everybody ready for work?

27:27.963 --> 27:29.747
I have an arraignment
to get ready for.

27:29.970 --> 27:30.986
What's an arraign...?

27:31.070 --> 27:32.473
Too late.

27:35.137 --> 27:37.151
ALLISON:
I know it's
kind of hard to follow.

27:37.326 --> 27:39.271
No, I... I think
I follow you.

27:39.326 --> 27:40.685
You want us to arrest
a federal judge

27:40.766 --> 27:43.125
for a crime he
hasn't committed. Yet.

27:43.216 --> 27:45.185
Look, maybe there's some other
way I haven't thought of yet.

27:45.254 --> 27:47.218
I'm just worried if we
don't do something come 1:00,

27:47.259 --> 27:48.835
you're going to get a 911 call

27:48.892 --> 27:50.561
from inside
the Florenzo Ristorante.

27:50.617 --> 27:53.226
Once that happens,
it's already too late.

27:54.641 --> 27:55.511
Allison...

27:56.208 --> 27:57.327
look at it from my side.

27:57.449 --> 27:59.144
You have been wrong
from time to time.

27:59.201 --> 28:00.663
Besides what is it
we're supposed
to arrest him for

28:00.719 --> 28:02.867
if he hasn't done
anything yet?
I don't know.

28:02.908 --> 28:05.107
All I know is,
this is the third time

28:05.163 --> 28:06.321
I have lived
this same day.

28:06.385 --> 28:09.039
Twice now, I have
tried to stop this man.

28:09.497 --> 28:12.177
Both times I failed, people
have been hurt or killed.

28:12.270 --> 28:13.928
You almost had him yesterday.

28:14.238 --> 28:14.911
Excuse me?

28:14.975 --> 28:17.079
You found out he was a judge,
you wouldn't check his trunk.

28:17.143 --> 28:20.206
If you had, you would have
found a dead body in it.

28:21.400 --> 28:22.638
What?

28:22.917 --> 28:24.406
I have absolutely
no recollection

28:24.478 --> 28:26.174
of any of this.
Because it
hasn't happened yet.

28:26.239 --> 28:27.550
Wait a second,
I have an idea,

28:27.638 --> 28:29.211
it might even be legal.

28:29.334 --> 28:30.414
Why don't you and Allison

28:30.485 --> 28:32.485
walk down to the
judge's chambers right now.

28:32.542 --> 28:34.468
Explain to him that a car,

28:34.524 --> 28:35.780
matching the description
of his honor's,

28:35.835 --> 28:38.332
appears to have been used
in the commission of a crime

28:38.405 --> 28:39.843
you're investigating.
Ask the judge

28:39.900 --> 28:41.683
if he wouldn't kindly
allow you to confirm

28:41.732 --> 28:43.476
that the car is still
parked where he left it.

28:43.555 --> 28:45.082
And if he would consent

28:45.148 --> 28:46.253
to letting you take
a peek in his trunk.

28:46.301 --> 28:47.897
If the car is still there,
there's nothing in the trunk,

28:47.945 --> 28:49.972
no harm, no foul.
I don't know.

28:50.378 --> 28:51.314
He's a judge.

28:52.715 --> 28:53.851
It's almost lunch.

28:53.879 --> 28:55.507
Don't worry.
I'll call her.

28:55.587 --> 28:57.546
She'll understand. Thanks.

29:01.930 --> 29:02.656
Morning.

29:02.706 --> 29:03.528
My name is Lee Scanlon.

29:03.585 --> 29:04.865
I telephoned about
five minutes ago.

29:04.969 --> 29:07.183
Spoke with an aide,
asked if there was any way

29:07.227 --> 29:08.480
I can get a look
at his honor's car

29:08.564 --> 29:10.759
as part of a criminal
investigation we're conducting.

29:10.848 --> 29:12.192
I was told
to speak to you.

29:12.249 --> 29:13.760
That you would know
where it was parked.

29:13.863 --> 29:14.558
I'm sorry.

29:14.623 --> 29:15.735
I'm going to need a minute.

29:15.801 --> 29:17.206
I'm going to have
to check with his honor.

29:17.264 --> 29:19.094
Nobody told me about this.

29:19.407 --> 29:20.398
Who's that?

29:21.319 --> 29:22.790
SECRETARY:
Well, that's Judge Whitman.

29:23.525 --> 29:24.822
Are you sure?

29:25.513 --> 29:27.397
I've worked for the man
for 26 years.

29:27.541 --> 29:29.230
I think I know
what he looks like.

29:29.603 --> 29:30.749
Allison?

29:31.541 --> 29:33.508
Doesn't
make sense.
What's going on?

29:33.657 --> 29:36.563
The person I saw yesterday
was a different Judge Whitman.

29:36.964 --> 29:37.891
Trust me.

29:37.998 --> 29:40.124
There are
no other Judge Whitmans.

29:40.796 --> 29:42.901
Don't feel bad, this
is a good thing.

29:43.187 --> 29:45.058
At least we know our federal
court system isn't run

29:45.089 --> 29:47.345
by a bunch of gun-
wielding maniacs.

29:48.847 --> 29:50.702
Besides, now I can
still make my lunch.

29:51.376 --> 29:52.855
No, you can't.

29:54.046 --> 29:57.022
I cancelled for you,
before we came.

29:58.454 --> 29:59.565
Okay.

30:01.901 --> 30:03.196
You hungry?

30:04.964 --> 30:06.292
Sure.

30:11.740 --> 30:12.458
Hello?

30:12.644 --> 30:14.186
Mrs. Dubois,
this is Nurse Dunbar

30:14.260 --> 30:16.058
down at Central
Middle School.

30:16.177 --> 30:18.158
I've got Ariel here and...

30:18.419 --> 30:19.326
ALLISON:
Yes?

30:20.159 --> 30:20.877
Mrs. Dubois?

30:21.014 --> 30:23.840
This is Principal Phillips.
I'm here with your daughter,

30:23.900 --> 30:25.156
Ariel, and I'm
afraid we've have

30:25.221 --> 30:27.379
ourselves a very
serious situation here.

30:27.461 --> 30:29.020
Oh my goodness,
is she alright?

30:29.026 --> 30:32.900
Oh, she's fine,
but apparently ????????

30:32.935 --> 30:36.263
Now we consider that a very
serious matter, Mrs. Dubois.

30:36.304 --> 30:37.279
I mean this is something

30:37.334 --> 30:40.143
that's going to go
on her permanent record.
Oh, my God.

30:40.343 --> 30:42.159
I mean, frankly, Mrs.
Dubois, I've never seen

30:42.214 --> 30:45.533
this kind of behavior,
this kind of attitude
from Ariel before.

30:45.573 --> 30:48.283
Wherever it came from,
we need to nip it in the bud.

30:48.363 --> 30:49.282
Yes.

30:49.380 --> 30:50.538
Thank you.

30:51.635 --> 30:53.201
Everything okay?
Yeah.

30:54.522 --> 30:57.114
No, it's Ariel.
It's a school thing.

30:58.234 --> 30:59.738
She's such a good kid.

31:03.976 --> 31:05.159
So I guess you've
been here before.

31:05.257 --> 31:07.349
What's good?
What time do you have?

31:08.672 --> 31:11.096
Uh, 1:16.
I don't get it.

31:11.116 --> 31:13.239
Yesterday you said that
the police got a phone call

31:13.304 --> 31:15.310
at 1:00 p.m. about a robbery.

31:15.918 --> 31:17.694
I never talked
to you yesterday, Allison.

31:17.799 --> 31:18.911
That yesterday never happened.

31:18.935 --> 31:20.374
That yesterday was a dream.

31:20.502 --> 31:21.629
WAITER:
Hi, my name is David.

31:21.734 --> 31:23.079
I'll be your, uh, your server.

31:23.159 --> 31:24.969
Would you guys like
to hear today's specials?

31:25.079 --> 31:26.889
Uh, yeah.
Okay, we, uh,

31:26.913 --> 31:28.400
MAN:
Can you check in
with the maitre d'

31:28.442 --> 31:30.965
and see if there's been a call
from Judge Whitman?

31:31.111 --> 31:32.999
He should of been here
15 minutes ago.

31:34.430 --> 31:35.542
Did you hear that?
Yeah.

31:35.598 --> 31:37.053
I'm not a big fan
of the goat cheese.

31:37.135 --> 31:38.469
You know, you go right ahead.

31:38.574 --> 31:39.876
No, the man at that table

31:39.900 --> 31:41.734
just mentioned Judge Whitman.

31:42.189 --> 31:44.103
I wasn't wrong, there
is a connection.

31:44.333 --> 31:45.821
Should I give you guys a minute?
Yeah.

31:50.892 --> 31:52.285
Look around, Allison.

31:52.435 --> 31:55.001
This restaurant
is not being robbed.

31:55.715 --> 31:56.904
MASKED MAN:
Everyone stay still.

31:56.960 --> 31:58.121
This is a robbery.

31:58.178 --> 32:00.302
If you move, you die.

32:00.383 --> 32:02.333
Everyone out of the bar,
everyone out of

32:02.389 --> 32:04.440
the kitchen now,
move it, move it.

32:04.461 --> 32:05.837
You hear that?
That was fast.

32:06.099 --> 32:06.791
(distant sirens wailing)
It's almost as if

32:06.855 --> 32:09.141
someone phoned it in
before it even happened.

32:09.196 --> 32:10.395
Quiet!

32:10.900 --> 32:14.907
Now I want everyone
to put on a mask and get down

32:14.987 --> 32:17.794
on the ground... now.

32:17.850 --> 32:19.362
Move, move, move.

32:19.651 --> 32:20.851
Down on the ground now.

32:21.353 --> 32:22.914
Everyone out of the kitchen.

32:23.026 --> 32:24.073
Out here.

32:29.449 --> 32:30.848
What you got
in there, fella?

32:32.961 --> 32:34.803
My asthma medication.

32:36.588 --> 32:38.460
Well, you look fine to me.

32:38.825 --> 32:40.297
Both hands in the air.

32:40.736 --> 32:42.328
And they better be empty.

32:45.416 --> 32:48.128
All right, stand up.

32:48.959 --> 32:50.375
Slowly.

32:56.238 --> 32:57.790
Open the jacket.

33:04.422 --> 33:05.820
Well...

33:06.142 --> 33:09.083
that's some serious asthma
you got, huh?

33:10.964 --> 33:12.636
Here's what
we're going to do.

33:13.103 --> 33:15.027
You're going to take
off the holster

33:15.181 --> 33:16.667
and put it on the table,

33:16.804 --> 33:18.785
and then you are going to
back away from the table.

33:18.813 --> 33:20.547
Do you understand me?

33:22.650 --> 33:23.935
Anytime.

33:32.104 --> 33:33.159
Lee, don't.

33:33.520 --> 33:34.960
His gun doesn't work.

33:38.871 --> 33:42.175
Remove that holster now
or I will pull this trigger.

33:42.294 --> 33:43.358
Lee, don't.

33:43.415 --> 33:45.246
The gun's going to jam,
trust me.

33:57.084 --> 34:00.237
You were right, his gun did jam.

34:10.737 --> 34:11.850
Who is he?

34:14.617 --> 34:16.185
Michael Williams.

34:31.661 --> 34:32.911
Bulletproof vest.

34:58.293 --> 35:01.295
Joe? Joe, honey, wake up,
I've got to ask you something.

35:03.215 --> 35:04.278
What's the matter?

35:05.190 --> 35:06.285
What's going on?

35:06.789 --> 35:07.917
What day is today?

35:08.279 --> 35:09.101
Hmm?

35:11.509 --> 35:13.676
You hate me,
don't you?

35:14.276 --> 35:17.840
I mean, deep
down inside,

35:18.120 --> 35:20.403
there's gotta be
like an anger thing.

35:20.697 --> 35:23.952
Otherwise, why would a
person wake a person?

35:24.607 --> 35:25.765
Is it Friday?

35:26.191 --> 35:28.351
Yes, it's Friday.

35:28.751 --> 35:30.110
(sighs):
Oh, thank God.

35:31.286 --> 35:32.031
Wait.

35:32.191 --> 35:34.222
BOTH:
I feel a hackneyed phrase
coming on.

35:35.422 --> 35:38.003
Wait. It passed.

35:42.956 --> 35:44.995
Why would he want a
hostage situation?

35:45.075 --> 35:46.828
No, no, I'm not buying it.

35:46.883 --> 35:49.273
He releases all the
hostages at 5:00 p.m.

35:50.154 --> 35:51.393
Well, maybe he's just
trying to get people

35:51.477 --> 35:52.255
out of work
for the afternoon.

35:52.345 --> 35:54.479
Maybe I should bring
my engineering team
to lunch there.

35:54.591 --> 35:56.440
Ah, yeah, well,
good luck.

35:56.710 --> 35:58.310
That place was packed.

35:58.527 --> 36:00.207
Scanlon and I could
hardly get a table.

36:00.294 --> 36:01.935
I don't think they
could accommodate...

36:06.551 --> 36:07.668
I almost forgot.

36:07.760 --> 36:09.044
At the restaurant,
there was this table,

36:09.118 --> 36:11.172
seemed like 20 people.

36:11.237 --> 36:14.084
And one of them asked e waiter
about Judge Whitman.

36:14.244 --> 36:16.699
But I thought you said that
the gunman wasn't Judge Whitman.

36:16.755 --> 36:18.843
It was some guy named Williams.

36:18.950 --> 36:20.938
Right. But he told Scanlon
he was Judge Whitman

36:20.994 --> 36:22.079
when we pulled him over.

36:22.154 --> 36:23.979
An he was driving
Judge Whitman's car.

36:24.290 --> 36:25.378
So what are you saying?

36:25.961 --> 36:27.546
Remember you told me
there was a dead body

36:27.611 --> 36:28.858
in the trunk of that car?

36:29.194 --> 36:30.256
No. When was that?

36:30.296 --> 36:32.141
Today. In the hospital.
A couple of hours from now.

36:32.184 --> 36:33.313
Never mind. I remember.

36:33.376 --> 36:35.664
I think this guy Williams might
have killed Judge Whitman.

36:35.729 --> 36:37.464
I think he might have
killed Judge Whitman

36:37.529 --> 36:39.768
and stuffed Whitman in
the trunk of his own car.

36:40.184 --> 36:41.472
Okay. Why?

36:41.776 --> 36:43.542
That I don't know.

36:46.149 --> 36:48.154
Florenzo Ristorante.
This is David.

36:48.532 --> 36:52.411
Hi. Um, I'm supposed to attend
a lunch at your restaurant today

36:52.460 --> 36:53.890
and for the life of me
I can't remember

36:53.915 --> 36:55.570
what time the reservation
is for.

36:56.226 --> 36:59.003
Well, what name
is the reservation under?

36:59.346 --> 37:00.130
I don't know.

37:00.346 --> 37:01.310
Uh, it's a big party.

37:01.401 --> 37:02.761
Maybe 20 people.

37:03.073 --> 37:04.418
Judge Whitman's party?

37:04.680 --> 37:05.713
Yes.

37:05.904 --> 37:07.847
Yeah, we got you down here
for 12:45.

37:08.465 --> 37:09.946
Uh, great.

37:10.088 --> 37:11.023
It wouldn't happen to say there

37:11.104 --> 37:12.560
who else might be attending,
would it?

37:12.720 --> 37:14.049
No, I'm sorry, ma'am.

37:14.087 --> 37:17.262
All I know is we were told
to be seen and not heard.

37:17.337 --> 37:20.407
Something about every judge in
the county being at that table

37:20.488 --> 37:22.736
???????

37:22.971 --> 37:23.870
Really?

37:24.494 --> 37:26.398
Uh, thank you so much
for your help.

37:27.468 --> 37:29.644
Every judge in the county is
going to be at that restaurant.

37:29.767 --> 37:30.677
I have to go see Devalos.

37:30.733 --> 37:32.140
Can you take the
kids to school?

37:32.316 --> 37:34.381
Yeah, of course I can,
um, but wait a second.

37:34.435 --> 37:36.099
I need to talk to you
about something.

37:36.404 --> 37:37.461
Endorphins?

37:37.617 --> 37:38.742
As a matter of fact.

37:38.835 --> 37:40.925
Heard you can get them
from running, which is
what I got to do.

37:43.140 --> 37:45.234
Girls, Daddy is going to be
driving you this morning.

37:45.371 --> 37:47.186
Mom...
Ariel, I want you to stay
home from school today.

37:47.264 --> 37:48.618
What?
Bridgette,

37:48.674 --> 37:51.098
an arraignment is when someone
pleads innocent or guilty.

37:51.153 --> 37:52.529
(phone ringing)
BRIDGETTE:
Are you talking to me?

37:52.634 --> 37:53.953
Marie, say hi to the nice man.

37:54.009 --> 37:55.753
Bye, girls,
see you tonight.

37:55.849 --> 37:59.319
MAN (on phone):
Hello? This is All Right
carpet cleaning service. Hello?

38:00.663 --> 38:01.892
Can I ask you a question?

38:02.507 --> 38:03.644
Don't ask me
how I know this,

38:03.716 --> 38:06.251
but a man is going to hold every
judge in the county hostage

38:06.316 --> 38:08.076
from 1:00 to 5:00 p.m. today.

38:08.789 --> 38:09.829
Okay.

38:10.004 --> 38:11.747
What changes?
What does that effect?

38:11.851 --> 38:13.203
How does that
make the world different?

38:14.204 --> 38:15.116
Well, I don't know.

38:15.197 --> 38:16.689
I suppose if the court
doesn't have a judge

38:16.754 --> 38:18.722
to preside over its cases
on a given day,

38:18.874 --> 38:21.041
then the court proceedings
don't happen on that day.

38:21.291 --> 38:22.546
What could be gained by that?

38:22.858 --> 38:23.722
Nothing.

38:23.836 --> 38:27.000
Everything would just be
rescheduled until the next day.

38:27.656 --> 38:29.087
Unless...
What?

38:29.473 --> 38:31.615
Unless somehow the proceedings
are time sensitive.

38:31.697 --> 38:32.406
What do you mean?

38:32.446 --> 38:34.454
Like my arraignment this
afternoon, for instance.

38:34.621 --> 38:37.037
What about that arraignment
makes it time sensitive?

38:37.550 --> 38:39.415
Normally it's no big deal.

38:39.790 --> 38:41.894
But the law mandates that
a defendant's arraignment

38:41.951 --> 38:44.807
be held within ten days of
the person's indictment.

38:44.860 --> 38:46.558
But as it happens, in
this particular case,

38:46.613 --> 38:48.396
the defense attorney
has worked very hard

38:48.452 --> 38:49.966
to get that arraignment
date pushed back

38:50.031 --> 38:54.322
until the final day of the ten
day window, which is today.

38:54.497 --> 38:56.581
What if that arraignment
doesn't happen today?

38:56.795 --> 38:59.555
The defendant's due process
is violated-- he's released.

39:01.322 --> 39:03.146
That's why
this is all happening.

39:03.259 --> 39:05.419
That's why "what"
is all happening?

39:05.462 --> 39:06.793
This hostage thing
you mentioned?

39:06.819 --> 39:07.850
Where is this coming from?

39:07.931 --> 39:10.358
I had a dream-- well, I had
three dreams actually.

39:10.385 --> 39:12.075
Allison, you're losing me.

39:12.133 --> 39:14.683
What makes you think that
your dream hostage taker

39:14.709 --> 39:17.433
has a connection with
the Krieger arraignment?

39:17.571 --> 39:19.601
I don't know.
His name is Michael Williams.

39:19.659 --> 39:21.713
That's really
about all I can tell you.

39:22.041 --> 39:23.273
Michael Williams?

39:26.025 --> 39:27.391
Krieger has a wife.

39:27.448 --> 39:29.065
Her maiden name
is Williams.

39:29.991 --> 39:31.912
She has a brother named Michael.

39:32.116 --> 39:33.854
The very first dream,

39:34.335 --> 39:37.693
I came to talk to you about
a second shooter in that case.

39:37.774 --> 39:38.518
And what did I do?

39:38.577 --> 39:40.269
You shooed me
out of the room.

39:40.295 --> 39:41.557
Not this time.

39:42.357 --> 39:44.093
Get me Detective
Scanlon please.

39:45.926 --> 39:47.864
Everyone stay still!
This is a robbery!

39:48.093 --> 39:48.997
You move, you die!

39:49.080 --> 39:50.561
I want everyone out of the bar!
Everyone out of the...!

39:50.618 --> 39:51.869
SCANLON:
Boys...

39:51.943 --> 39:54.774
He's wearing a bulletproof
vest-- aim for his head.

39:55.698 --> 39:57.135
Michael Williams...

39:57.271 --> 39:58.127
you're under arrest.

39:58.167 --> 40:00.316
Drop the gun, put your
hands over your head.

40:01.009 --> 40:02.643
Okay.

40:29.076 --> 40:31.493
Hey. Are you okay?

40:31.854 --> 40:34.099
Hmm? Everything
all right?

40:34.261 --> 40:35.278
I don't know,
I think so.

40:35.347 --> 40:37.484
You wouldn't happen to know
what day it is, would you?

40:38.469 --> 40:40.564
It's Saturday, darling.

40:40.676 --> 40:41.900
Why do you ask?

40:43.311 --> 40:44.508
I don't know.

40:44.590 --> 40:46.314
It was a pretty
amazing week.

40:47.026 --> 40:48.930
I packed a lot
into last week.

40:48.971 --> 40:51.105
Packed a real lot
into yesterday.

40:51.218 --> 40:52.393
Mm-hmm.

40:52.505 --> 40:53.658
Hmm...

40:55.353 --> 41:00.545
Guess I'm kinda... sad,
kinda let down.

41:00.585 --> 41:02.345
Kinda depressed.

41:02.425 --> 41:04.351
After all
that excitement, I mean.

41:05.448 --> 41:06.551
You don't say.

41:08.120 --> 41:11.530
Any thoughts?
Any suggestions?

41:11.839 --> 41:12.943
I don't know.

41:13.246 --> 41:15.494
You could do
something physical.

41:15.630 --> 41:16.998
That always helps.

41:17.117 --> 41:19.970
Creates endorphins,
elevates the mood.

41:20.428 --> 41:22.108
Hm, endorphins, huh?

41:22.268 --> 41:23.213
Mm-hmm.

41:23.268 --> 41:24.235
Physical, huh?

41:24.389 --> 41:27.260
Mm, yeah, you know,
running. Running's good.

41:30.067 --> 41:31.222
Anything else?

41:31.291 --> 41:33.442
Mm, let me think.

41:38.561 --> 41:39.466
What are you doing?

41:39.521 --> 41:40.489
I'm thinking.

41:40.657 --> 41:42.658
Well, think about this--
you have about ten seconds

41:42.721 --> 41:45.049
to peel off those shorts
and get over here

41:45.088 --> 41:46.570
and spread a little happiness

41:46.626 --> 41:48.145
before the kids
start getting up.

41:48.425 --> 41:49.761
Wow. Someone's
in a crabby mood.

41:49.841 --> 41:51.561
No, let me explain
something to you.

41:51.639 --> 41:53.001
Sex isn't just sex.

41:53.065 --> 41:54.968
Sex is good for you.

41:54.993 --> 41:56.847
Sex releases endorphins.

41:56.903 --> 41:58.518
Endorphins make you happy.

41:58.582 --> 41:59.712
No, I know.

42:00.111 --> 42:01.325
Well then,
come over here.

42:01.413 --> 42:02.654
All right. Fine.

42:03.094 --> 42:04.383
But I warned you.

42:04.526 --> 42:05.569
You warned me.

42:05.631 --> 42:06.975
You made your choice.

42:07.053 --> 42:08.999
(laughs):
l made my choice.

42:09.083 --> 42:10.229
I just hope you
can live with it,

42:10.276 --> 42:11.828
'cause there's
no going back.

42:12.852 --> 42:14.430
Vicious cycle.

42:14.884 --> 42:16.211
Got it.
