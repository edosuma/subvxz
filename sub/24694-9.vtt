IN NEW YORK CITY'S WAR ON CRIME,

00:04.367 --> 00:06.400
THE WORST CRIMINAL OFFENDERS
ARE PURSUED

00:06.400 --> 00:09.133
BY THE DETECTIVES
OF THE MAJOR CASE SQUAD.

00:09.133 --> 00:10.834
THESE ARE THEIR STORIES.

00:13.267 --> 00:15.067
>> THINGS LONG DEAD.

00:15.067 --> 00:18.167
SEE HOW THEY RISE AGAIN?

00:18.167 --> 00:20.434
WHY?

00:20.434 --> 00:23.000
WHY KEEP SILENCE
ALL THESE 14 YEARS,

00:23.000 --> 00:26.133
WHEN ON THIS LETTER,
WHICH HE NEVER WROTE,

00:26.133 --> 00:29.934
THE BELOVED TEARS
WERE YOUR TEARS?

00:29.934 --> 00:32.200
>> [echoing]
THE BLOOD STAINS WERE HIS.

00:43.934 --> 00:47.734
[sound slowing]
WHY YOUR NOBLE SILENCE
KEPT SO LONG?

00:52.267 --> 00:53.567
>> [echoing] YOU ASK WHY?

00:53.567 --> 00:58.801
ALAS, WHY FOR ANYTHING
OTHER THAN MY LOVE, ROXANNE?

00:58.801 --> 01:04.667
>> SEEING HER, I HEARD...
THE REVELATIONS.

01:04.667 --> 01:07.033
ARRAYED IN SCARLET,

01:07.033 --> 01:10.567
DECKED...WITH GOLDEN STONES,

01:10.567 --> 01:17.367
OFFERING ABOMINATIONS,
THE FILTH OF FORNICATIONS.

01:17.367 --> 01:20.234
BUT I WILL SAVE HER.

01:20.234 --> 01:22.133
I'LL SAVE THEM ALL.

01:26.267 --> 01:28.667
[cheers and applause]

01:34.734 --> 01:36.767
>> ME? OH!

01:36.767 --> 01:40.501
[cheers and applause]

01:47.767 --> 01:49.167
>> LOTS OF HARD WORK.

01:49.167 --> 01:50.601
AND IT SHOWED!

01:50.601 --> 01:52.133
>> THANK YOU.

01:52.133 --> 01:54.868
NEXT TIME, SOMETHING MODERN,
LIKE TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.

01:54.868 --> 01:56.434
>> OH!
>> ONE STEP AT A TIME.

01:56.434 --> 01:58.467
>> DID MR. DEVILDIS ENJOY IT?

01:58.467 --> 01:59.534
I SAW HIM IN THE AUDIENCE.

01:59.534 --> 02:01.334
>> HE DID, YES.

02:01.334 --> 02:03.434
UH, HE WOULD BE HERE NOW,
BUT HE WAS CALLED AWAY.

02:03.434 --> 02:05.601
>> HMM.

02:05.601 --> 02:08.533
>> EXCUSE ME.
I'VE GOT TO CIRCULATE.

02:08.533 --> 02:11.434
>> WELL, DADDY DIDN'T LEAVE
BEFORE THE END, DID HE?

02:11.434 --> 02:13.400
>> HE LEFT WHEN YOU WERE
IN THE GARDEN.

02:13.400 --> 02:15.901
>> THAT'S MY BEST SCENE.

02:15.901 --> 02:17.334
>> HONEY, I'M SURE
IT WAS IMPORTANT.

02:36.334 --> 02:39.234
>> MILLS...
[door closes]

02:39.234 --> 02:41.567
GUESS WHO'S THE LUCKIEST COUPLE
IN THE WORLD.

02:41.567 --> 02:43.100
HUH?

02:43.100 --> 02:44.767
REMEMBER NOBODY
WANTED THE PISTONS,

02:44.767 --> 02:47.133
AND YOU THOUGHT I WAS...
MILLS?

02:47.133 --> 02:49.667
HUH! OHH!

02:49.667 --> 02:55.367
[groans]

02:55.367 --> 02:57.300
>> I'M SORRY.

02:57.300 --> 02:59.968
THERE'S NOTHING MORE
I CAN DO FOR YOU.

03:01.434 --> 03:03.634
UHH!

03:03.634 --> 03:05.701
[panting]

04:06.000 --> 04:09.200
>> SINGLE COFFEE CUP
AND SAUCER.

04:09.200 --> 04:13.334
COFFEE POT'S BEEN WASHED.

04:13.334 --> 04:16.534
BUT THESE GROUNDS, THEY'RE...

04:16.534 --> 04:18.233
THEY'RE STILL MOIST.

04:18.233 --> 04:20.267
IF SHE WAS EXPECTING
HER HUSBAND HOME,

04:20.267 --> 04:22.734
WHY NOT HAVE THE COFFEE POT
IN THE COFFEE MAKER,

04:22.734 --> 04:23.934
WAITING FOR HIS ARRIVAL?

04:23.934 --> 04:25.934
>> YOU THINK THE KILLER
WASHED UP?

04:25.934 --> 04:28.300
>> I THINK HE WAS,
YOU KNOW, COMFORTABLE HERE.

04:28.300 --> 04:32.367
I THINK...SHE SAT HERE
WITH HIM, TALKING,

04:32.367 --> 04:33.934
WHEN HE STRUCK HER.

04:33.934 --> 04:37.501
SHE WAS LISTENING.
SHE TRUSTED HIM.

04:37.501 --> 04:40.434
>> I DON'T ENVY WHOEVER
HAS TO DEAL WITH NEXT OF KIN.

04:40.434 --> 04:43.067
WE GOT THE ADDRESS BOOKS,
COMPUTER.

04:43.067 --> 04:44.434
>> YEAH, AND ALL THIS HERE.

04:44.434 --> 04:46.133
>> YEAH.

04:46.133 --> 04:49.033
>> SO IF SHE
WAS KILLED FIRST...

04:49.033 --> 04:51.767
>> THE NEIGHBOR SAID
THE HUSBAND OFTEN WORKED LATE.

04:51.767 --> 04:53.467
>> YEAH, I THINK
HE KNEW THAT TOO.

04:53.467 --> 04:56.734
I THINK HE...

04:56.734 --> 04:58.400
SAT HERE.

04:58.400 --> 04:59.734
HE HAD A CUP OF COFFEE.

04:59.734 --> 05:02.901
HE WAITED UNTIL HE HEARD
THE HUSBAND ARRIVE.

05:02.901 --> 05:06.234
AND THEN HE CAME IN...

05:06.234 --> 05:09.300
KILLER STRIKES HIM
ON THE LEFT SIDE.

05:09.300 --> 05:11.367
HUSBAND FALLS
INTO THE REFRIGERATOR.

05:11.367 --> 05:13.634
>> WITH A LEFT
TEMPORAL FRACTURE.

05:13.634 --> 05:17.033
THERE'S ALSO A FRACTURE
IN THE OCCIPITAL CROWN.

05:17.033 --> 05:18.534
TWO SELECTIVE BLOWS.

05:18.534 --> 05:20.234
ENOUGH TO KILL,
BUT NOT MORE.

05:20.234 --> 05:23.300
>> IT LACKS DISORGANIZATION
OF SOMEONE OUT OF CONTROL.

05:23.300 --> 05:25.934
>> NAH, I THINK
HE WAS IN TOTAL CONTROL.

05:25.934 --> 05:28.033
I THINK HE KNEW THIS PLACE.

05:28.033 --> 05:29.234
HE PLANNED THIS.

05:29.234 --> 05:32.601
AND HE SHOWED UP
WITH A SMALL, HEAVY WEAPON.

05:32.601 --> 05:34.801
>> YEAH, FROM THE INJURIES,
MY GUESS WOULD BE A HAMMER.

05:34.801 --> 05:37.567
>> AND THE KILLER
DIDN'T WANT THIS.

05:43.300 --> 05:45.434
>> IT DOESN'T HAVE THE LOOK
OF SEXUAL ASSAULT.

05:45.434 --> 05:48.434
>> YEAH.

05:48.434 --> 05:49.634
THIS.

05:49.634 --> 05:51.901
>> MAYBE SHE WAS HOLDING IT
WHEN SHE FELL?

05:51.901 --> 05:54.067
>> YEAH, BUT HER RIGHT HAND
IS UNDER HER HIP.

05:54.067 --> 05:55.701
HER LEFT
IS ON TOP OF HER HEAD.

05:55.701 --> 05:57.234
NO, IT WOULD
TAKE HIM TWO HANDS

05:57.234 --> 05:58.934
TO ARRANGE THE TOWELS

05:58.934 --> 06:04.567
TO COVER
HER EXPOSED BREAST.

06:04.567 --> 06:06.968
>> OUR KILLER IS CONCERNED
ABOUT MODESTY?

06:09.968 --> 06:12.567
>> MY FIRST QUESTION
IS ABOUT THAT MONEY.

06:12.567 --> 06:15.667
>> HE HAD $1,000 IN 20S.

06:15.667 --> 06:18.033
HE MIGHT HAVE HELD IT
IN HIS HAND, YOU KNOW,

06:18.033 --> 06:19.934
TO SHOW TO HIS WIFE.

06:19.934 --> 06:22.300
>> A SUCCESSFUL SCORE
FROM A DRUG DEAL?

06:22.300 --> 06:24.033
>> POSSIBLY,
BUT THE NARCOTICS SWEEP

06:24.033 --> 06:26.167
OF THE HOUSE AND VEHICLE
WAS NEGATIVE.

06:26.167 --> 06:28.067
>> WHAT ABOUT
A SEXUAL COMPONENT?

06:28.067 --> 06:29.367
>> THE PRELIMINARY AUTOPSY

06:29.367 --> 06:31.868
SHOWED NO SIGNS OF ANY
SEXUAL ACTIVITY.

06:31.868 --> 06:33.100
>> BUT AN EXPOSED BREAST,

06:33.100 --> 06:34.767
DELIBERATELY
COVERED WITH A TOWEL--

06:34.767 --> 06:36.501
WE SHOULDN'T DISCOUNT
SOMETHING WEIRD.

06:36.501 --> 06:38.767
>> SHE WAS YOUNG, ATTRACTIVE.

06:38.767 --> 06:43.033
MAYBE SHE GOT INVOLVED
WITH SOME DERANGED NUT?

06:43.033 --> 06:44.267
>> WHO KILLS
HER AND HER HUSBAND

06:44.267 --> 06:45.467
OUT OF JEALOUSY.

06:47.534 --> 06:49.868
>> WHY WOULD SHE
SIT AT THE TABLE

06:49.868 --> 06:51.200
AND HAVE COFFEE
WITH A LOVER

06:51.200 --> 06:53.501
IF SHE WAS EXPECTING
HER HUSBAND TO COME HOME, THEN?

06:53.501 --> 06:56.400
[phone rings]

06:56.400 --> 06:58.033
>> ROSS.

06:58.033 --> 06:59.300
THANK YOU.

06:59.300 --> 07:00.767
[hangs up phone]

07:00.767 --> 07:01.934
HER SISTER
AND BROTHER-IN-LAW

07:01.934 --> 07:03.767
HAVE COME TO IDENTIFY
THE BODIES.

07:10.367 --> 07:13.167
>> [gasps]

07:13.167 --> 07:14.667
[crying]

07:14.667 --> 07:16.067
>> IT'S OKAY.

07:16.067 --> 07:17.300
>> OH, MY...

07:19.667 --> 07:24.234
>> WE SAW THEM ABOUT...
A MONTH AGO?

07:24.234 --> 07:26.367
>> I WAS HOPING THEY WOULD
COME TO THE PLAY.

07:26.367 --> 07:28.300
>> PLAY?

07:28.300 --> 07:32.033
>> OUR DAUGHTER KATHY WAS
IN A SCHOOL PLAY LAST NIGHT.

07:32.033 --> 07:34.000
>> IF THEY HAD COME,
YOU KNOW, MAYBE...

07:35.400 --> 07:37.701
I CAN'T EVEN
THINK ABOUT IT.

07:37.701 --> 07:38.968
>> DID THEY EVER
TALK ABOUT ANYONE

07:38.968 --> 07:40.968
THEY THOUGHT OF
AS AN ENEMY?

07:40.968 --> 07:43.100
>> AN ENEMY? NO.

07:43.100 --> 07:44.501
NO, THERE WAS NOTHING
LIKE THAT

07:44.501 --> 07:46.133
WITH MILLIE AND JOE.

07:46.133 --> 07:49.300
>> ANY PROBLEMS?
MAYBE SOMETHING FINANCIAL?

07:49.300 --> 07:50.734
>> UM, I MEAN,
THINGS WERE A LITTLE TIGHT.

07:50.734 --> 07:52.467
BUT THEY ALWAYS KNEW
THAT PAUL AND I

07:52.467 --> 07:53.901
WERE THERE TO HELP THEM.

07:53.901 --> 07:55.801
>> AND THEIR MARRIAGE
SEEMED GOOD?

07:55.801 --> 07:58.067
>> VERY GOOD.

07:58.067 --> 08:02.234
THEY WERE GONNA
HAVE A BABY.

08:02.234 --> 08:03.601
>> I'M SORRY, I DON'T--

08:03.601 --> 08:05.067
I DON'T THINK WE CAN
DO ANY MORE OF THIS.

08:05.067 --> 08:06.534
>> YEAH, THERE'S JUST
ONE LAST THING.

08:06.534 --> 08:08.300
DO YOU KNOW OF ANY PROBLEMS

08:08.300 --> 08:10.334
THAT HE WAS HAVING
IN THE WORK PLACE?

08:10.334 --> 08:14.234
>> UH, NOT THAT I KNOW OF.

08:14.234 --> 08:15.801
>> UH, SO...

08:15.801 --> 08:18.334
>> [whispering] IT'S OKAY.

08:18.334 --> 08:20.501
>> JOE GOT ALONG GOOD
WITH EVERYONE.

08:20.501 --> 08:23.434
>> NEVER A SINGLE CONFLICT
HERE?

08:23.434 --> 08:26.067
>> DO YOU KNOW
WHAT A CRANE OPERATOR DOES?

08:26.067 --> 08:28.334
YOU'RE WORKING DOWN HERE
WHILE THE CRANE

08:28.334 --> 08:31.267
IS HOLDING THREE TONS OF STEEL
OVER YOUR HEAD.

08:31.267 --> 08:33.501
YOUR LIFE
IS IN JOE'S HANDS.

08:33.501 --> 08:34.868
ANYBODY HAD
A PROBLEM WITH HIM,

08:34.868 --> 08:36.933
I'D HAVE HEARD ABOUT IT.

08:36.933 --> 08:38.067
>> HE WENT HOME

08:38.067 --> 08:39.701
WITH QUITE A BIT
OF MONEY LAST NIGHT.

08:39.701 --> 08:42.067
>> YEAH, A BASKETBALL POOL.

08:42.067 --> 08:43.567
GAVE ME AND THE CREW
A COUPLE HUNDRED BUCKS

08:43.567 --> 08:45.100
FOR BEERS AND, UH,

08:45.100 --> 08:46.567
TOOK THE REST HOME
TO SURPRISE MILLIE.

08:46.567 --> 08:48.400
>> PASSED ON THE PARTY?

08:48.400 --> 08:50.434
>> KID ON THE WAY.

08:50.434 --> 08:52.234
WORK'S NOT AS STEADY
AS IT WAS.

08:52.234 --> 08:55.567
>> SO HE WAS MAYBE HAVING
FINANCIAL PROBLEMS OR...

08:55.567 --> 08:57.701
>> HE WAS ALWAYS ASKING
FOR OVERTIME.

08:57.701 --> 08:59.701
HE HAD A BALLOON PAYMENT
ON HIS MORTGAGE.

08:59.701 --> 09:02.033
[scoffs] WAS HOPING HIS
BROTHER-IN-LAW COULD FIX IT.

09:02.033 --> 09:03.968
THE GUY'S A BANKER.

09:03.968 --> 09:05.133
[beep]

09:05.133 --> 09:07.334
>> I, UH, SPOKE TO EVERYONE
BUT YOUR MOTHER.

09:07.334 --> 09:08.567
OH, UH, YEAH.

09:08.567 --> 09:09.868
I CALLED THE HOME.

09:09.868 --> 09:11.300
THEY'RE GONNA KEEP HER
AWAY FROM THE NEWS.

09:11.300 --> 09:12.434
AND I'M GONNA
GO OUT THERE TOMORROW.

09:14.801 --> 09:16.834
>> IS THIS...FOR THE BANK?

09:16.834 --> 09:18.234
>> YEAH, IT'S MODIFICATIONS

09:18.234 --> 09:19.634
ON THE FIRST PLAN
THAT I SUBMITTED.

09:19.634 --> 09:21.567
IT, UH...

09:21.567 --> 09:23.467
IT HELPS KEEP
MY MIND OFF THINGS.

09:23.467 --> 09:27.300
>> WELL...THEY HAVE
NO IDEA WHAT THEY LOST IN YOU.

09:27.300 --> 09:28.701
[approaching footsteps]

09:28.701 --> 09:32.234
>> OKAY, I KNOW
THAT IT'S A BAD TIME.

09:32.234 --> 09:34.133
BUT I HAVE THIS BIG SCENE
FOR DRAMA.

09:34.133 --> 09:35.267
I PROMISED TRINA

09:35.267 --> 09:36.334
I'D BE OVER AT HER HOUSE
TOMORROW NIGHT,

09:36.334 --> 09:37.334
AND WE'D RUN LINES.

09:37.334 --> 09:38.534
>> WHAT PLAY IS IT?

09:38.534 --> 09:41.033
>> OH, UH,
IT'S <i>SWEET BIRD OF YOUTH</i>

09:41.033 --> 09:42.634
BY TENNESSEE WILLIAMS.

09:42.634 --> 09:45.501
>> HE WAS A HOMOSEXUAL,
WASN'T HE?

09:45.501 --> 09:46.767
>> DAD...

09:46.767 --> 09:48.567
HE WAS A BRILLIANT WRITER.

09:48.567 --> 09:50.434
AND HE WROTE GREAT ROLES
FOR WOMEN.

09:50.434 --> 09:52.300
>> HONEY, YOU KNOW,
WHAT YOU'RE DOING

09:52.300 --> 09:54.634
IS HELPING YOU KEEP YOUR MIND
OFF OUR TRAGEDY, IT'S--

09:54.634 --> 09:56.200
>> YEAH, MOM'S RIGHT.

09:56.200 --> 09:58.767
THIS WOULD HELP ME TOO.

09:58.767 --> 09:59.868
>> PLEASE.

10:02.901 --> 10:04.167
>> OKAY.

10:07.501 --> 10:09.300
[sighs]

10:09.300 --> 10:10.300
>> THANK YOU.

10:19.868 --> 10:22.801
>> MR. DEVILDIS,
WHAT A SURPRISE.

10:22.801 --> 10:25.267
>> I, UH, I FELT BAD
NOT SEEING YOU

10:25.267 --> 10:26.801
AND THANKING YOU
AFTER THE PLAY.

10:26.801 --> 10:29.100
>> YOU CAME ALL THE WAY
OUT HERE TO TELL ME THAT?

10:29.100 --> 10:31.567
>> UH, NO,
I HAD BUSINESS NEARBY

10:31.567 --> 10:33.334
AND MY WIFE
PREVAILED ON ME

10:33.334 --> 10:34.901
TO LOOK
FOR YOUR ACTING STUDIO.

10:34.901 --> 10:36.367
AND, ANYWAY, HERE I AM.

10:36.367 --> 10:39.434
I, UH, LEFT THE PLAY EARLY.

10:39.434 --> 10:41.567
IT WAS RUDE OF ME.
BUSINESS CALL.

10:41.567 --> 10:43.601
>> I UNDERSTAND.
THAT'S OKAY.

10:43.601 --> 10:46.167
>> KATHY'S VERY ENTHUSIASTIC
ABOUT DRAMA.

10:46.167 --> 10:47.467
>> YEAH.

10:47.467 --> 10:49.567
YEAH, I HEAR THAT YOU'RE
NOT 100% APPROVING.

10:49.567 --> 10:51.467
>> [laughs]
WELL, IT'S UH...

10:51.467 --> 10:52.934
NOT SOMETHING I'M USED TO.

10:52.934 --> 10:55.267
>> DIDN'T SEEING HER
IN THE PLAY TURN YOU AROUND?

10:55.267 --> 10:58.200
>> HAD A VERY STRONG
IMPACT ON ME.

10:58.200 --> 11:00.400
AND KATHY WANTS TO CONTINUE
WITH ACTING.

11:00.400 --> 11:02.801
MAYBE...IF WE COULD TALK.

11:02.801 --> 11:06.100
>> WELL, COME IN.
I'LL MAKE COFFEE.

11:06.100 --> 11:08.334
TRY SELLING YOU ON
SENDING KATHY TO YALE DRAMA.

11:08.334 --> 11:09.667
>> [laughs]

11:09.667 --> 11:11.300
THAT'S A BIG ORDER.

11:11.300 --> 11:12.934
>> SHE'S A BIG TALENT.

11:32.534 --> 11:33.767
>> I REMEMBERED
MENTION OF THE FLYER

11:33.767 --> 11:34.934
IN THE INTERPRECINCT BULLETIN.

11:34.934 --> 11:36.367
THAT, COUPLED WITH
THE CAUSE OF DEATH...

11:36.367 --> 11:37.734
>> BLUNT FORCE INSTRUMENT?

11:37.734 --> 11:39.968
>> A LOT OF SIMILARITIES
IN THE M.O.

11:39.968 --> 11:43.300
NO SIGN OF FORCED ENTRY.

11:43.300 --> 11:46.501
>> SO SHE KNEW HER KILLER.

11:46.501 --> 11:48.501
>> [sighs]

11:48.501 --> 11:50.501
MULTIPLE BLOWS DELIVERED

11:50.501 --> 11:52.434
WITH A SIMILAR BLUNT FORCE
INSTRUMENT.

11:52.434 --> 11:53.767
>> WHILE POURING COFFEE
FOR HER KILLER.

11:53.767 --> 11:56.200
SADLY, VERY FAMILIAR.

11:56.200 --> 11:57.601
>> WELL,
THE STEGEMAN'S INJURIES

11:57.601 --> 11:59.701
WERE ROUNDED INDENTATIONS.

11:59.701 --> 12:01.667
A BALL-PEEN HAMMER.

12:01.667 --> 12:03.501
THIS HAS AN ALMOST
IDENTICAL LOOK.

12:03.501 --> 12:05.701
>> TIME OF DEATH?

12:05.701 --> 12:08.501
>> WELL, FROM LIVIDITY
AND RIGOR I'D SAY LAST NIGHT,

12:08.501 --> 12:10.534
7:00 TO 10:00 P.M.

12:10.534 --> 12:12.901
SHE...DIRECTED PLAYS?

12:12.901 --> 12:14.767
>> DRAMA TEACHER
AT A CHRISTIAN HIGH SCHOOL.

12:14.767 --> 12:16.267
>> WHO FOUND HER?

12:16.267 --> 12:18.167
>> DOREEN HOWELL.
THEY LIVE TOGETHER.

12:18.167 --> 12:19.701
WE HAVE HER
WITH A PARAMEDIC.

12:19.701 --> 12:20.734
>> ALL RIGHT, THANKS.

12:20.734 --> 12:22.734
>> THANKS.
VILMA TAUGHT DRAMA.

12:22.734 --> 12:24.601
MILLIE STEGEMAN
TAUGHT SPECIAL ED.

12:24.601 --> 12:26.300
BOTH TEACHERS.

12:26.300 --> 12:29.501
>> WHAT, BESIDES THIS,
CONNECTS THEM?

12:29.501 --> 12:30.868
>> I'M CERTAIN SHE DIDN'T
KNOW THOSE PEOPLE.

12:30.868 --> 12:31.934
[sniffles]

12:31.934 --> 12:33.334
I CALLED HER
FROM MY MOTHER'S

12:33.334 --> 12:36.501
WHEN THOSE MURDERS
WERE OVER THE NEWS.

12:36.501 --> 12:39.267
WE TALKED ABOUT THEM.
SHE WOULD HAVE SAID SOMETHING.

12:39.267 --> 12:41.300
DID THE SAME PERSON
KILL VILMA?

12:41.300 --> 12:43.667
>> THAT'S SOMETHING
WE HAVE TO CONSIDER.

12:43.667 --> 12:46.234
>> VILMA'S CLASSES
WERE ONLY FOR CHILDREN?

12:46.234 --> 12:47.267
NO ADULT ED?

12:47.267 --> 12:49.801
>> ONLY KIDS.

12:49.801 --> 12:50.901
YEAH.

12:50.901 --> 12:53.467
SHE JUST DID A PRODUCTION
OF CYRANO.

12:53.467 --> 12:56.000
>> YEAH, I WAS WONDERING
IF YOU KNEW

12:56.000 --> 12:57.534
IF THERE WAS ANY WAY
WE COULD FIND OUT

12:57.534 --> 12:59.434
WHO RECEIVED THESE FLYERS
FROM THE PLAY.

12:59.434 --> 13:03.267
>> YES...THE PARENTS
GAVE US A LIST OF NAMES.

13:03.267 --> 13:05.033
WE SENT THEM OUT.

13:05.033 --> 13:07.133
>> THREE KILLINGS
IN TWO DAYS.

13:07.133 --> 13:08.501
>> THE TABLOIDS
HAVE ALREADY LABELED HIM

13:08.501 --> 13:09.634
A SERIAL KILLER.

13:09.634 --> 13:11.601
>> THERE MAY BE NO REASON
TO ARGUE THAT.

13:11.601 --> 13:12.734
MAKE SURE EVERYTHING
GOES TO THE F.B.I.

13:12.734 --> 13:14.234
FOR POSSIBLE PROFILING.

13:14.234 --> 13:15.868
>> WELL, WE'LL SEND IT,
BUT THERE ISN'T MUCH.

13:15.868 --> 13:17.400
>> PAUL AND MARY DEVILDIS,

13:17.400 --> 13:19.033
THE SISTER AND BROTHER-IN-LAW

13:19.033 --> 13:20.734
WHO CAME TO IDENTIFY
MILLIE STEGEMAN,

13:20.734 --> 13:22.367
THEIR DAUGHTER
WAS IN THE PLAY.

13:22.367 --> 13:23.734
THEY PUT MILLIE AND JOE

13:23.734 --> 13:25.367
ON THE LIST
TO RECEIVE A FLYER.

13:25.367 --> 13:27.167
>> IT'S PROBABLY
JUST A FAMILY CONNECTION,

13:27.167 --> 13:28.767
BUT WE'LL TAKE
A CLOSER LOOK AT THEM.

13:28.767 --> 13:30.133
>> ANYTHING FROM CROSS CHECKS

13:30.133 --> 13:31.234
OF THE VICTIMS'
PHONE RECORDS?

13:31.234 --> 13:32.367
>> STILL UNDERWAY.

13:32.367 --> 13:34.868
THE NAMES OF ANYONE
WHO CALLED BOTH VICTIMS

13:34.868 --> 13:36.033
WILL GO IN VICAP.

13:36.033 --> 13:38.434
>> I DON'T EXPECT MUCH
FROM VICAP.

13:38.434 --> 13:40.267
THERE WERE NO HITS
ON LATENT PRINTS

13:40.267 --> 13:41.501
FROM EITHER CRIME SCENE.

13:41.501 --> 13:43.567
I--I'M PRETTY CERTAIN

13:43.567 --> 13:46.133
THAT WE'RE DEALING WITH
A FIRST OFFENDER.

13:47.934 --> 13:50.067
>> ALL RIGHT, THEN,
OUR ONLY LINKAGE.

13:50.067 --> 13:51.400
HOW MANY OF THESE WENT OUT?

13:51.400 --> 13:53.200
>> THERE WERE 116 NAMES
ON THE LIST,

13:53.200 --> 13:56.033
BUT PEOPLE COULD HAVE
HANDED THEM OUT TO ANYONE.

13:56.033 --> 13:59.033
>> NO ROBBERY,
NO SEXUAL COMPONENT.

13:59.033 --> 14:01.567
PEOPLE HAVE BEEN KILLED
OVER SCHOOL BEAUTY PAGEANTS,

14:01.567 --> 14:03.968
SOCCER, LITTLE LEAGUE.

14:03.968 --> 14:05.534
MAYBE IT ORIGINATES
FROM THE DRAMA CLASS.

14:08.434 --> 14:10.601
>> WE DEBATED CLOSING DOWN.

14:10.601 --> 14:13.167
FIRST THE MEDIA,
NOW THE POLICE.

14:13.167 --> 14:15.601
WE'RE A CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIAN SCHOOL.

14:15.601 --> 14:17.968
IT'S A--A NIGHTMARE FOR US.

14:17.968 --> 14:19.067
>> WELL, IT'S WORSE
THAN A NIGHTMARE

14:19.067 --> 14:20.601
FOR YOUR LATE DRAMA TEACHER.

14:20.601 --> 14:23.467
>> NOW, YOU SAID
THAT SHE'S WORKED HERE

14:23.467 --> 14:24.534
FOR SIX YEARS.

14:24.534 --> 14:25.801
WAS SHE WELL-LIKED?

14:25.801 --> 14:28.067
>> HER CLASSES
WERE ALWAYS CAPACITY.

14:28.067 --> 14:29.067
>> YOU CALLED THIS

14:29.067 --> 14:30.801
A CONSERVATIVE
CHRISTIAN SCHOOL.

14:30.801 --> 14:33.601
WAS THERE OPPOSITION
TO THE KIDS BEING ONSTAGE?

14:33.601 --> 14:35.501
>> NOT WITH PLAYS
LIKE <i>MARY POPPINS</i>

14:35.501 --> 14:36.968
OR <i>SOUND OF MUSIC.</i>

14:36.968 --> 14:38.434
>> WHAT ABOUT <i>CYRANO?</i>

14:38.434 --> 14:41.634
>> MOST PARENTS FELT A PLAY
ABOUT UNREQUITED LOVE

14:41.634 --> 14:43.067
WAS A LESSON IN ABSTINENCE.

14:43.067 --> 14:44.834
>> MOST.

14:44.834 --> 14:47.033
THAT'S NOT EVERYONE.

14:47.033 --> 14:48.934
>> I CAN ASSURE YOU

14:48.934 --> 14:50.067
THERE WAS NO CONFLICT

14:50.067 --> 14:52.467
BETWEEN ANY PARENTS
AND VILMA.

14:52.467 --> 14:54.267
EVERY STUDENT WAS REQUIRED

14:54.267 --> 14:55.701
TO GIVE US A LETTER
FROM THEIR PARENTS

14:55.701 --> 14:57.801
IF THEY WANTED
TO PARTICIPATE IN DRAMA.

14:57.801 --> 14:59.667
>> WE'LL WANT TO SEE
THOSE LETTERS.

14:59.667 --> 15:02.000
>> THINK THEY'RE POLICE?

15:02.000 --> 15:03.934
>> WELL, THERE
ARE PRIVACY ISSUES.

15:03.934 --> 15:05.534
>> YOUR DRAMA TEACHER
WAS MURDERED.

15:05.534 --> 15:06.767
YOU DON'T WANT IT
GETTING AROUND

15:06.767 --> 15:08.567
THAT YOU WON'T COOPERATE.

15:10.434 --> 15:12.501
>> VILMA'S STUDENTS NEED HELP
DEALING WITH THIS.

15:12.501 --> 15:14.634
I WAS ABOUT TO LEAD THEM
IN A PRAYER SESSION.

15:14.634 --> 15:17.434
>> WELL, WE'LL WAIT
FOR THE LETTERS.

15:22.968 --> 15:25.968
>> HEY, RAY,
IT'S PAUL DEVILDIS.

15:25.968 --> 15:27.634
>> OH, HOW ARE YA?

15:27.634 --> 15:31.300
>> OH, WELL AS CAN
BE EXPECTED.

15:31.300 --> 15:33.267
>> SO SAD ABOUT
YOUR WIFE'S SISTER.

15:33.267 --> 15:35.501
ANYTHING, ANYTHING WE CAN DO.

15:35.501 --> 15:38.400
>> AH, I APPRECIATE THAT, RAY.

15:38.400 --> 15:40.400
I UNDERSTAND THE PRESSURE
THAT YOU'RE UNDER.

15:40.400 --> 15:43.200
>> AS YOU KNOW, IT'S NOT EASY
MAKING DECISIONS

15:43.200 --> 15:45.701
THAT IMPACT PEOPLE'S LIVES.

15:45.701 --> 15:48.501
>> WELL, IT'LL END.

15:48.501 --> 15:51.434
YOU KNOW, IT'S BEEN, UM,
THERAPEUTIC FOR ME

15:51.434 --> 15:54.367
TO WORK ON MY OWN
RESTRUCTURING PLAN.

15:54.367 --> 15:57.534
IF I DROPPED IT BY,
WOULD YOU REVIEW IT?

15:57.534 --> 15:58.934
>> OF COURSE.

15:58.934 --> 16:00.834
>> UH, AND SINCE
I'M NO LONGER AT THE BANK,

16:00.834 --> 16:02.400
COULD IT BE
FOR YOUR EYES ONLY?

16:02.400 --> 16:03.901
>> YOU HAVE MY ASSURANCE.

16:03.901 --> 16:05.634
>> THANKS, RAY.

16:05.634 --> 16:07.100
[phone beeps]

16:08.968 --> 16:09.934
>> POOR GUY.

16:13.801 --> 16:15.601
[squeaking]

16:17.100 --> 16:18.501
>> PERFECT QUOTE.

16:18.501 --> 16:21.434
>> "THEY THAT SOW IN TEARS
SHALL REAP IN JOY."

16:21.434 --> 16:24.934
>> THAT STILL DOESN'T EXPLAIN
WHY OR WHO DID IT.

16:24.934 --> 16:26.801
>> YOU KNOW, THE POLICE
WERE AT OUR SCHOOL.

16:26.801 --> 16:28.234
>> THEY'RE GONNA SOLVE THIS.

16:28.234 --> 16:30.200
>> I HOPE THEY SOLVE IT BEFORE
SOMETHING HAPPENS TO US.

16:30.200 --> 16:32.267
>> KATHY...
>> PEOPLE WE KNEW ARE DEAD.

16:32.267 --> 16:33.834
>> WHY SHOULDN'T WE
BE SCARED TOO?

16:33.834 --> 16:37.400
>> BECAUSE...WE TRUST
IN THE SHIELD OF OUR FAITH.

16:37.400 --> 16:38.901
>> [scoffs] WELL...

16:38.901 --> 16:40.634
YOU TRUST IN FAITH
ALL YOU WANT, DAD.

16:40.634 --> 16:44.701
BUT IF I'M HERE ON MY OWN,
I AM NOT ANSWERING THE DOOR.

16:47.801 --> 16:49.734
[chopping]

16:53.334 --> 16:55.701
>> I JUST SPOKE TO THE BANK
THAT HOLDS THE LOAN

16:55.701 --> 16:57.234
ON JOE AND MILLIE STEGEMAN'S
HOUSE.

16:57.234 --> 16:59.067
>> LET ME GUESS:
THEY NEEDED THAT MONEY

16:59.067 --> 17:00.200
FROM THE BASKETBALL POOL.

17:00.200 --> 17:01.267
>> OH, IT WOULDN'T
HAVE HELPED.

17:01.267 --> 17:02.968
THEIR MONTHLY PAYMENTS
HAD DOUBLED.

17:02.968 --> 17:05.934
THE BANK HOLDING THE LOAN
IS THE SAME BANK

17:05.934 --> 17:07.467
WHERE PAUL DEVILDIS WORKED.

17:07.467 --> 17:10.467
>> THAT EXPLAINS
WHY THEY COULD ASK FOR HELP.

17:10.467 --> 17:12.367
>> EXCEPT PAUL WAS FIRED
FIVE MONTHS AGO.

17:15.800 --> 17:19.701
>> SO PAUL DEVILDIS.

17:19.701 --> 17:21.099
LOOKS LIKE
HE WAS FEELING PRESSURE

17:21.099 --> 17:22.334
FROM MORE THAN ONE PLACE.

17:22.334 --> 17:24.867
THIS IS THE CONSENT LETTER
TO ALLOW KATHY

17:24.867 --> 17:26.300
TO GO TO DRAMA CLASS.

17:26.300 --> 17:28.567
>> WE SHOULD PAY THEM
A VISIT.

17:28.567 --> 17:30.434
>> YEAH.

17:30.434 --> 17:32.167
[car alarm chirps]

17:34.868 --> 17:36.801
>> MR. DEVILDIS.

17:36.801 --> 17:40.067
>> OH, YES, DETECTIVES.

17:40.067 --> 17:41.834
UH, ANY DEVELOPMENTS?

17:41.834 --> 17:44.100
>> WE'RE JUST GATHERING
INFORMATION.

17:44.100 --> 17:45.634
>> WE'RE TALKING TO PEOPLE
WHOSE CHILDREN

17:45.634 --> 17:47.167
WERE IN THE PLAY <i>CYRANO.</i>

17:47.167 --> 17:49.200
OH...YEAH, MY DAUGHTER KATHY
PLAYS THE LEAD,

17:49.200 --> 17:50.200
BUT I DON'T SEE THAT--

17:50.200 --> 17:51.634
>> DAD.
>> UH, KATHY, YEAH.

17:51.634 --> 17:54.501
COME MEET DETECTIVE EAMES
AND GOREN.

17:54.501 --> 17:56.501
>> YEAH, I SAW YOU AT SCHOOL.

17:56.501 --> 17:58.868
>> YEAH, YOU'RE
IN VILMA'S CLASS.

17:58.868 --> 18:00.834
DO YOU ENJOY DRAMA?

18:00.834 --> 18:04.534
>> WELL, I--I WANT
TO STUDY ACTING IN COLLEGE.

18:04.534 --> 18:06.701
>> DO YOU HAVE A PROBLEM
WITH THAT?

18:06.701 --> 18:09.901
>> IS THERE A REASON
FOR ASKING ME THAT?

18:09.901 --> 18:13.133
>> WELL, WE WERE READING
THE PARENTAL CONSENT FORMS

18:13.133 --> 18:15.334
FOR THE DRAMA CLASS.

18:15.334 --> 18:18.167
MOST OF THE, UH, FORMS
WERE SIGNED BY BOTH PARENTS.

18:18.167 --> 18:21.267
BUT KATHY'S WERE ONLY SIGNED
BY HER MOM.

18:22.834 --> 18:25.133
>> YES, I DID
HAVE SOME RESISTANCE.

18:25.133 --> 18:27.567
YOU KNOW, KATHY'S
DADDY'S LITTLE GIRL.

18:27.567 --> 18:29.000
AND IT'S...

18:29.000 --> 18:30.801
HARD TO IMAGINE HER

18:30.801 --> 18:33.000
NOT TEN YEARS YOUNGER
THAN SHE ACTUALLY IS.

18:33.000 --> 18:34.300
>> UNFORTUNATELY.

18:34.300 --> 18:36.400
>> OH, COME ON,
I'VE COME AROUND, HAVEN'T I?

18:36.400 --> 18:38.567
>> YOU SAW HER
IN <i>CYRANO,</i> THEN?

18:38.567 --> 18:40.534
>> YOU ASKING ME WHERE I WAS

18:40.534 --> 18:41.934
THE NIGHT THAT JOE AND MILLIE
WERE MURDERED?

18:41.934 --> 18:43.801
>> DAD!
>> WHAT, HONEY? IT'S OKAY.

18:43.801 --> 18:45.501
THE COPS GOTTA CHECK UP
ON EVERYBODY.

18:45.501 --> 18:47.267
ISN'T THAT TRUE?

18:47.267 --> 18:48.367
>> IT IS ROUTINE.

18:48.367 --> 18:50.834
>> YES, OF COURSE
I SAW THE PLAY.

18:50.834 --> 18:52.968
KATHY, UH, HOW MANY
CURTAIN CALLS?

18:52.968 --> 18:55.434
>> UHH, THREE.

18:55.434 --> 18:56.501
>> [chuckles] THAT'S RIGHT.

18:56.501 --> 18:57.734
DOES THAT ANSWER IT?

18:57.734 --> 18:59.167
IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME,
I HAVE AN ERRAND.

18:59.167 --> 19:00.634
AND THEN, UM,
WE'LL BE ATTENDING

19:00.634 --> 19:03.200
JOE AND MILLIE'S
MEMORIAL SERVICE.

19:03.200 --> 19:04.400
>> OKAY, I'M GONNA GO.

19:04.400 --> 19:06.133
>> OKAY, I'LL SEE YOU LATER.

19:06.133 --> 19:07.601
>> THEY WERE HAVING
FINANCIAL HARDSHIP,

19:07.601 --> 19:09.133
ON THE VERGE
OF LOSING THEIR HOUSE.

19:09.133 --> 19:11.367
BUT I--I GUESS
YOU KNEW THAT, RIGHT?

19:11.367 --> 19:13.200
>> I WOULDN'T
HAVE LET THAT HAPPEN.

19:13.200 --> 19:16.968
>> YOU NO LONGER
HAVE YOUR JOB AT THE BANK.

19:16.968 --> 19:19.834
SO HOW WOULD YOU...
HELP THEM?

19:19.834 --> 19:22.033
>> THEY'RE FAMILY.

19:22.033 --> 19:23.467
I WOULD HAVE FOUND A WAY.

19:23.467 --> 19:25.868
>> I SEE.

19:32.968 --> 19:34.300
>> WELL, HE LIED.

19:34.300 --> 19:35.834
>> ABOUT THE PLAY?

19:35.834 --> 19:38.901
>> NO FATHER FORGETS
HIS DAUGHTER'S CURTAIN CALLS.

19:38.901 --> 19:41.434
I ALSO THINK HE LIED
ABOUT THE STEGEMANS.

19:41.434 --> 19:47.834
YOU KNOW, THIS OFFER OF HELP
THAT HE COULDN'T FULFILL.

19:47.834 --> 19:50.767
>> JOE, MILLIE,

19:50.767 --> 19:54.367
AND THEIR UNBORN CHILD.

19:54.367 --> 19:58.567
NOW LET US REFLECT ON
A PASSAGE FROM <i>REVELATIONS...</i>

19:58.567 --> 20:03.968
TO LIFT THE HEAVY CLOAK
OF OUR GRIEF.

20:03.968 --> 20:08.667
THEY ARE NOW BEFORE
THE THRONE OF GOD.

20:08.667 --> 20:12.467

32:36.567 --> 32:38.167
LEGS WERE APART.

32:38.167 --> 32:40.467
NOW, WHEN HE PULLED THEM
TOGETHER

32:40.467 --> 32:41.934
TO BIND THEM,

32:41.934 --> 32:44.734
I THINK SHE DUG HER HEELS DOWN
DELIBERATELY

32:44.734 --> 32:47.734
TO MAKE
THESE TRENCHES HERE.

32:47.734 --> 32:49.634
>> NOT EXACTLY
A BREADCRUMB TRAIL.

32:49.634 --> 32:51.801
>> NO, AND THIS.

32:51.801 --> 32:54.267
WITH HER HANDS BACK HERE,

32:54.267 --> 32:58.167
SHE DREW THIS IN THE DIRT
WITH HER FINGERS.

33:01.200 --> 33:02.868
>> LOOKS LIKE, UH...

33:02.868 --> 33:04.934
A BOX WITH A CROSS
JUTTING OUT.

33:04.934 --> 33:06.968
WHAT IS IT?

33:06.968 --> 33:08.300
>> YOU TELL US.

33:08.300 --> 33:11.000
>> YOU'RE THINKING...

33:11.000 --> 33:14.300
THE BOX IS A COFFIN,
CROSS MEANS A CEMETERY.

33:14.300 --> 33:16.901
>> WE HAVE STATE TROOPERS
SEARCHING EVERY CEMETERY

33:16.901 --> 33:18.267
IN A 50-MILE RADIUS.

33:18.267 --> 33:21.667
SO FAR, NOTHING.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.801
>> THEN THIS STONE.

33:23.801 --> 33:26.434
WHILE HE WAS GETTING READY
TO THROW HER IN THE TRUCK,

33:26.434 --> 33:29.634
SHE RUBBED THIS AGAINST
THIS BOULDER HERE.

33:29.634 --> 33:33.300
MAKES THIS MARK.

33:33.300 --> 33:34.667
>> IT'S NOTHING WE CAN READ.

33:34.667 --> 33:37.801
>> SHE HAD TO HAVE A REASON
FOR DOING IT.

33:37.801 --> 33:40.133
>> OKAY, IT'S NOW, WHAT,
THE MID-40S?

33:40.133 --> 33:42.601
IT'S GONNA BE IN THE LOW 30S
BY MIDNIGHT.

33:42.601 --> 33:43.767
IF SHE'S OUTSIDE...

33:43.767 --> 33:45.934
>> EXPOSURE WILL KILL HER
BEFORE DAWN.

33:55.868 --> 33:57.000
>> I BELIEVE, BY LAW,

33:57.000 --> 33:58.634
I'M ENTITLED
TO A BOOK OF SCRIPTURE.

33:58.634 --> 33:59.868
>> OH, YEAH?

33:59.868 --> 34:02.734
AND WHAT CHAPTER
WOULD YOU USE TO COMFORT YOU?

34:02.734 --> 34:04.667
>> UH, SEVERAL.

34:04.667 --> 34:05.834
FOR THE PAIN I FEEL

34:05.834 --> 34:07.667
AT NOT BEING ABLE
TO TAKE MY OWN LIFE.

34:07.667 --> 34:10.199
>> STAND HERE.

34:10.199 --> 34:13.367
THAT'S FUNNY, I DON'T REMEMBER
THERE BEING A SCRIPTURE

34:13.367 --> 34:16.967
THAT ENDORSES SUICIDE.

34:16.967 --> 34:20.634
>> INTERPRETATION COMES
ONLY THROUGH ABSOLUTE FAITH.

34:20.634 --> 34:24.167
>> SUCH ASSURANCE.

34:24.167 --> 34:26.734
EVEN ABRAHAM
HAD MOMENTS OF DOUBT.

34:26.734 --> 34:29.601
>> HE RAISED A KNIFE
OVER HIS SON...

34:29.601 --> 34:31.167
AS GOD COMMANDED.

34:35.199 --> 34:37.100
>> YES, BUT...

34:37.100 --> 34:40.132
GOD SAW ABRAHAM'S AGONY,

34:40.132 --> 34:41.167
AND HE STOPPED HIM.

34:43.234 --> 34:45.434
YOU, YOU USED A...

34:45.434 --> 34:47.000
A HAMMER, A KNIFE,

34:47.000 --> 34:48.900
A GUN, A BOMB.

34:48.900 --> 34:50.000
NOTHING STOPPED YOU.

34:50.000 --> 34:51.833
>> GOD'S WILL WAS CLEAR.

34:51.833 --> 34:52.801
>> CLEAR?

34:54.567 --> 34:59.501
GOD WAS MERCIFUL
WITH ABRAHAM'S SON.

34:59.501 --> 35:02.033
BUT SHOWED NO MERCY
IN YOUR CASE.

35:02.033 --> 35:05.100
>> I DON'T QUESTION
THE VOICE OF GOD.

35:05.100 --> 35:09.501
>> WHY IS KATHY STILL ALIVE

35:09.501 --> 35:11.701
WHEN ALL THE OTHERS
WERE SACRIFICED?

35:11.701 --> 35:13.334
>> YOU DON'T KNOW
THAT SHE'S ALIVE.

35:24.901 --> 35:26.300
>> NOW I DO.

35:30.901 --> 35:34.200
>> IT'S SO OBVIOUS
WHAT YOU'RE DOING.

35:34.200 --> 35:35.734
I WON'T HEAR
ANY MORE OF THIS.

35:35.734 --> 35:38.501
>> GOD COMMANDED ABRAHAM
TO SHOW HIS DEVOTION

35:38.501 --> 35:42.300
BY KILLING ISAAC,
HIS ONLY SON...

35:42.300 --> 35:44.200
WHO HE LOVED MOST.

35:44.200 --> 35:48.334
BUT THE ONE THAT YOU
LOVE MOST IS STILL ALIVE.

35:48.334 --> 35:51.834
WHAT, DID GOD SAY, "KILL
ALL THE OTHERS, SPARE HER"?

35:51.834 --> 35:52.934
>> YOU WON'T TRICK ME.

35:52.934 --> 35:54.968
>> YOU'VE ALREADY
BEEN TRICKED.

35:54.968 --> 35:59.100
AND...DECEIVED.

35:59.100 --> 36:02.434
KATHY'S SWEETNESS.

36:02.434 --> 36:06.100
YEAH, THE...GLOW
IN HER EYES.

36:11.701 --> 36:16.467
HER SOFT, YOUNG FLESH.

36:16.467 --> 36:20.133
THAT WARMTH THAT YOU FEEL
WHEN YOU HOLD HER TIGHT.

36:20.133 --> 36:22.901
YEAH, THE VOICE
THAT SPEAKS THOSE WORDS,

36:22.901 --> 36:24.033
IS THAT THE SAME VOICE

36:24.033 --> 36:26.133
THAT TOLD YOU
TO SPARE HER LIFE?

36:26.133 --> 36:27.234
>> I WON'T HEAR THIS.

36:27.234 --> 36:28.767
>> NO, YOU KNOW
IN YOUR HEART THAT

36:28.767 --> 36:30.467
THAT'S NOT GOD'S VOICE--

36:30.467 --> 36:33.734
THAT THAT'S THE TRICKSTER,
THE TEMPTER.

36:33.734 --> 36:36.200
THE MASTER OF ALL DECEPTION.

36:36.200 --> 36:39.834
YOU KNOW WHO
I'M TALKING ABOUT, PAUL.

36:39.834 --> 36:42.467
YOU KNOW WHAT HIS NAME IS.

36:42.467 --> 36:43.934
>> WHAT?

36:43.934 --> 36:44.934
>> I'M SAYING
YOU DON'T SERVE GOD.

36:44.934 --> 36:46.667
YOU SERVE HIM.

36:46.667 --> 36:48.200
SAY HIS NAME.

36:48.200 --> 36:50.300
COME ON, SAY IT.

36:50.300 --> 36:52.601
COME ON.
DOES IT TERRIFY YOU?

36:52.601 --> 36:54.100
>> ENOUGH.

36:56.868 --> 36:58.601
I AM THE SHEPHERD...

36:58.601 --> 37:02.133
WHO LEADS THEM
TO THE ETERNAL WATERS.

37:02.133 --> 37:04.968
>> YOU DELIVER DEATH.

37:04.968 --> 37:06.567
YOU SERVE THE DECEIVER.

37:06.567 --> 37:08.067
>> NO.

37:08.067 --> 37:09.901
I SAW HER ON THAT STAGE

37:09.901 --> 37:11.968
AND HE COMMANDED ME.

37:11.968 --> 37:15.767
>> THE DECEIVER
SEES YOUR DESIRE.

37:18.033 --> 37:19.834
HE COMMANDS YOU--

37:19.834 --> 37:22.400
>> DON'T SAY SUCH FILTH.

37:24.734 --> 37:27.133
>> A GAY DRAMA SCHOOL TEACHER.

37:27.133 --> 37:29.367
DID SHE EVER
TOUCH YOUR DAUGHTER?

37:29.367 --> 37:32.567
DID SHE EVER WANT
TO TOUCH YOUR DAUGHTER?

37:32.567 --> 37:35.200
>> SHE'S DEAD.
I ENDED ALL OF THEM.

37:35.200 --> 37:36.634
>> WHY IS THAT?

37:38.734 --> 37:40.434
>> IS THAT BECAUSE
WHEN YOU SAW HER ON STAGE,

37:40.434 --> 37:41.834
YOU WERE AROUSED?

37:41.834 --> 37:44.968
YOU FELT THAT VILENESS
INSIDE YOU.

37:44.968 --> 37:47.968
YOU WERE AROUSED
BY YOUR DAUGHTER,

37:47.968 --> 37:51.067
SO, THEREFORE,
EVERYONE IS AROUSED.

37:51.067 --> 37:54.667
YOU SEE, THE TEMPTER
SEES THAT IN YOU.

37:54.667 --> 37:58.868
HE SEIZED ON YOUR WEAKNESS,

37:58.868 --> 38:01.000
AND YOU OBEYED HIM.

38:02.701 --> 38:04.267
JUST SAY HIS NAME.

38:04.267 --> 38:07.701
SAY HIS NAME, PAUL.

38:07.701 --> 38:09.434
SAY IT!

38:09.434 --> 38:12.434
SAY HIS NAME!

38:12.434 --> 38:14.634
COME HERE.

38:14.634 --> 38:16.434
WHOSE SERVANT ARE YOU?

38:16.434 --> 38:18.400
IF THERE IS A GOD--

38:18.400 --> 38:20.400
>> THERE IS A GOD,

38:20.400 --> 38:23.501
AND I ACTED
ON HIS WILL ALONE.

38:23.501 --> 38:25.234
>> IF YOU ARE GOD'S SERVANT,

38:25.234 --> 38:27.868
THAN HOW CAN YOU
KILL THE PEOPLE THAT YOU LOVE?

38:27.868 --> 38:29.734
>> MY FAITH, PASSED DOWN

38:29.734 --> 38:33.300
FROM GENERATIONS OF THOSE
WHO HAVE SERVED GOD,

38:33.300 --> 38:36.400
WILL NOT BE UNDONE BY YOU.

38:36.400 --> 38:37.701
>> YOUR FAITH?

38:46.634 --> 38:48.501
PASSED DOWN BY THEM?

38:50.400 --> 38:55.067
YOUR DUTCH ANCESTORS.

38:55.067 --> 38:56.501
AND THIS?

38:56.501 --> 38:59.033
>> THAT'S A STONE RUBBING
OF THE GRAVESTONE

38:59.033 --> 39:00.601
OF MY GREAT,
GREAT GRANDFATHER.

39:00.601 --> 39:02.734
>> YES, STONE RUBBING.

39:02.734 --> 39:06.667
KATHY MADE THIS ONE.

39:06.667 --> 39:07.901
SHE TOLD ME ABOUT IT.

39:07.901 --> 39:10.501
>> WHAT?
>> YEAH.

39:10.501 --> 39:13.067
THAT YOU...TAUGHT HER
THE FAMILY HISTORY.

39:13.067 --> 39:15.000
YOU SHOWED HER HOW
TO MAKE STONE RUBBINGS

39:15.000 --> 39:16.400
OF THE FAMILY GRAVES.

39:16.400 --> 39:18.267
IN FACT, SHE TOLD ME
ABOUT IT TODAY.

39:18.267 --> 39:20.367
>> THAT'S IMPOSSIBLE.

39:20.367 --> 39:21.934
SHE'S TOLD YOU NOTHING.

39:21.934 --> 39:23.467
>> THEN HOW COULD I KNOW?

39:25.767 --> 39:27.634
>> WHEN YOU WERE WITH HER,

39:27.634 --> 39:30.868
AND HER ARMS WERE BOUND
BEHIND HER,

39:30.868 --> 39:33.200
SHE DREW IN THE DIRT

39:33.200 --> 39:36.634
A COFFIN AND A CROSS.

39:36.634 --> 39:38.067
SEE, SHE MEANT CEMETERY.

39:38.067 --> 39:39.901
AND THEN SHE TOOK A STONE,

39:39.901 --> 39:42.534
AND SHE PUSHED IT
AGAINST A BOULDER.

39:42.534 --> 39:46.701
SHE MADE A MARK, SHE...

39:46.701 --> 39:48.367
STONE RUBBING, YOU SEE.

39:48.367 --> 39:50.567
YOU SEE,
SHE WAS CALLING OUT TO US.

39:50.567 --> 39:52.868
YOU SEE, SHE WANTS TO LIVE.

39:52.868 --> 39:55.033
GOD WANTS HER TO LIVE.

39:55.033 --> 39:57.968
>> SHE--SHE WANTS
TO BE WITH ME.

39:57.968 --> 40:01.033
>> SHE CAN'T BE WITH YOU!

40:01.033 --> 40:02.868
SHE SERVES GOD.

40:02.868 --> 40:08.200
ARE YOU STILL BLIND
TO GOD'S WILL?

40:08.200 --> 40:10.133
DON'T YOU SEE
WHAT'S HAPPENING?

40:10.133 --> 40:13.434
CAN'T YOU SEE?

40:13.434 --> 40:15.467
IT'S JUST LIKE WITH ABRAHAM.

40:19.167 --> 40:22.501
YOU SEE, GOD...
STOPPED ABRAHAM

40:22.501 --> 40:24.133
FROM KILLING HIS SON.

40:24.133 --> 40:25.801
THAT'S WHAT'S HAPPENING
RIGHT NOW.

40:25.801 --> 40:31.267
IT'S GOD'S HAND
STOPPING YOU.

40:31.267 --> 40:36.334
KATHY PRAYED TO GOD
AND GOD ANSWERED.

40:36.334 --> 40:37.734
DON'T YOU WANT TO SERVE GOD?

40:37.734 --> 40:40.067
>> [weakly] UH, YES.

40:40.067 --> 40:41.701
I WANT ONLY TO SERVE GOD.

40:41.701 --> 40:45.000
>> SO THEN TELL ME...

40:45.000 --> 40:46.801
TELL ME WHERE SHE IS.

40:46.801 --> 40:49.934
PAUL, WHILE
THERE'S STILL TIME.

40:49.934 --> 40:51.667
TELL ME, PAUL.

40:51.667 --> 40:55.167
HELP GOD ANSWER
KATHY'S PRAYERS.

40:58.534 --> 41:01.434
>> UH...

41:01.434 --> 41:02.567
I SEE--

41:02.567 --> 41:03.567
I'VE...

41:06.000 --> 41:08.200
I'VE SERVED EVIL.

41:12.534 --> 41:13.567
>> THEN BREAK THAT SERVITUDE

41:13.567 --> 41:15.968
AND PUT YOUR GOD
ABOVE ALL ELSE.

41:19.133 --> 41:21.033
AND TELL ME WHERE
THE CEMETERY IS.

41:21.033 --> 41:22.501
>> [sniffling]

41:30.601 --> 41:32.067
MORRILTOWN.

41:36.300 --> 41:43.801
>> * NEARER, MY GOD,
TO THEE *

41:43.801 --> 41:45.601
[dogs barking]

41:45.601 --> 41:52.501
* NEARER TO THEE *

41:52.501 --> 41:58.234
* EVEN THOUGH
IT BE A CROSS... *

41:58.234 --> 42:00.734
>> [coughing]

42:00.734 --> 42:08.634
>> * THAT RAISETH ME *

42:08.634 --> 42:12.567
* STILL ALL MY SONG *

42:12.567 --> 42:16.968
* SHALL BE *

42:16.968 --> 42:23.567
* NEARER *

42:23.567 --> 42:28.334
* OH, NEARER *

42:28.334 --> 42:32.834
* MY GOD *

42:32.834 --> 42:38.868
* TO THEE *
