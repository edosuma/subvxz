00:08.760 --> 00:11.480
-Phone us on--"
-That's great. That's literally it.

00:11.560 --> 00:12.680
What?

00:12.760 --> 00:15.840
You don't want me to finish it?
There's no phone number, it just stops.

00:15.920 --> 00:17.120
All good, buddy.

00:17.200 --> 00:20.280
It's half an advert.
That's a bit bloody peculiar, isn't it?

00:20.360 --> 00:21.960
Hello, Steven, this is Clem Fandango.

00:22.040 --> 00:24.480
-Can you hear me?
-Shut up, I'm talking to the grown-up.

00:24.560 --> 00:25.880
Who the hell wants half an advert?

00:25.960 --> 00:28.680
Honestly, Steven, don't worry.
It's just a demo for some new client.

00:28.760 --> 00:30.360
It probably won't go anywhere anyway.

00:30.440 --> 00:32.920
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Hello, Steven.

00:33.000 --> 00:34.240
We've really got to wrap this up

00:34.320 --> 00:36.440
-and crack on with another session.
-[text alert]

00:37.440 --> 00:39.240
-Is that Colin?
-Yeah, he's waiting outside.

00:39.320 --> 00:41.160
All right, all right.

00:41.240 --> 00:43.240
I suppose I'll see you two next Thursday.

00:43.320 --> 00:45.200
[both, awkwardly] Mm.

00:45.280 --> 00:47.320
-[Danny] Actually, Steven?
-What?

00:47.400 --> 00:49.520
Would you mind showing Colin in
on your way out?

00:49.600 --> 00:52.240
-Only I don't think he's been here before.
-[sighs]

00:57.280 --> 00:59.600
It's just through there.
I think they're expecting you.

00:59.680 --> 01:01.480
I know where it is thank you, big boy.

01:04.080 --> 01:06.880
[laughter]

01:10.120 --> 01:12.960
-[Danny] God, I thought he'd never leave.
-[Clem] He's such a dick.

01:14.160 --> 01:15.960
-What the...?
-Are you sure he's gone?

01:16.040 --> 01:18.760
Oh, yeah. Just gonna play some
of the guide through your headphones.

01:18.840 --> 01:20.760
-OK.
-[Toast's recording plays]

01:20.840 --> 01:21.920
Got it.

01:23.080 --> 01:24.080
Are we rolling?

[in Steven's voice] "Remember,

01:32.520 --> 01:36.360
There's a great new career
out there waiting for you.

01:36.440 --> 01:41.040
-[both laugh]
-Phone us on 08081 570000.

01:41.120 --> 01:42.160
What the f...?

02:05.920 --> 02:08.919
Well, I see you're enjoying
the hospitality here, Steven.

02:09.479 --> 02:12.840
Well, it's a bit early for me,
but your chef was very insistent.

02:12.920 --> 02:16.360
-I know, he's a wee devil, isn't he?
-He is. Anyway, bottoms up!

02:16.440 --> 02:20.560
So, I understand you are returning
to the theater in the Scottish play.

02:20.640 --> 02:23.400
-[laughs] Yes. I notice you didn't say it.
-I know.

02:23.480 --> 02:26.560
Is it still a big no-no in theatrical
circles to actually say  Macbeth?

02:28.400 --> 02:29.440
Yeah.

02:29.520 --> 02:31.800
Anyway, it's a great part
and it's in Regent's Park.

02:31.880 --> 02:32.880
It's in the open air.

02:32.960 --> 02:36.160
Yeah. It's always a pleasure
to do Shakespeare and it's a nice bonus

02:36.240 --> 02:39.200
that you get some fresh air
at the same time. [laughs loudly]

02:39.280 --> 02:44.800
Well, it's being simultaneously broadcast,
of course, live on ITV's  Night of Culture.

02:46.520 --> 02:47.520
Is it?

02:47.600 --> 02:50.440
-Yes, yes.
-Right, well, I wasn't aware of that.

02:50.520 --> 02:55.200
Yeah, it is. Because, you know, doing
a whole Shakespeare play live on TV,

02:55.280 --> 02:58.280
I mean, that's... you know, that's brave.
That must be nerve-racking.

02:59.160 --> 03:01.800
Yeah, I'm sure I'll rise to the challenge.

03:01.880 --> 03:03.560
Now, who else is in it?

03:03.640 --> 03:07.040
Oh, well, there's Una Length,
Rob Continental--

03:07.120 --> 03:08.520
Ray Purchase?

03:08.600 --> 03:13.160
There's... oh and, of course, Sue Pressier
who's worked a lot with Stanley Kubrick.

03:13.240 --> 03:15.760
-Oh, are you a Kubrick fan?
-I wouldn't say I'm a fan,

03:15.840 --> 03:17.920
but, uh, I did meet him once.

03:18.000 --> 03:19.600
-Really?
-Mm.

03:19.680 --> 03:22.200
-What happened?
-Well, it was a long time ago.

03:22.280 --> 03:23.600
-Have you got time?
-Yeah.

03:23.680 --> 03:26.720
OK, well, it would have been about 1969.

03:26.800 --> 03:31.960
I was doing some cheap pornographic film
in Pinewood Studios.

03:32.040 --> 03:34.160
I don't know
whether this is of any interest to you.

03:34.240 --> 03:38.800
[Jane] I could tell they were desperate
to get you. "Name your price," they said.

03:39.360 --> 03:42.800
And I picked the biggest number
I could think of.

03:43.680 --> 03:46.480
Five thousand pounds!

03:46.560 --> 03:49.280
For a voiceover. Isn't that terrific?

03:49.360 --> 03:51.200
-Five thousand pounds?
-Yes!

03:51.840 --> 03:53.280
And they said name your price?

03:53.360 --> 03:58.360
Anything at all. There were no limits
on how high they were willing to go!

03:58.920 --> 04:00.880
But why didn't you say
six thousand pounds?

04:01.680 --> 04:04.440
Or six hundred thousand pounds,
or a million pounds?

04:04.520 --> 04:06.200
Or a million million pounds?

04:06.960 --> 04:12.520
Because, at the time, the biggest number
I could think of was five thousand pounds.

04:12.600 --> 04:13.720
[scoffs]

04:13.800 --> 04:16.600
Anyway, we got the gig.

04:16.680 --> 04:20.079
You're blasted lucky
to be getting any voiceover jobs at all.

04:20.160 --> 04:24.960
This tiny chap who sounds just like you
is moving in on your patch.

04:25.040 --> 04:27.960
Slightly cheaper,
and infinitely easier to work with.

04:28.040 --> 04:31.360
Yeah, this can't be legal.
Can you not sue him or something?

04:31.440 --> 04:33.560
-Ha!
-And talking of suing people,

04:33.640 --> 04:36.360
I should be suing you
for failing to mention

04:36.440 --> 04:39.480
that this Shakespeare thing
is going out live on TV!

04:39.560 --> 04:40.600
Oh, did I not tell you?

04:41.280 --> 04:44.640
Yes.  A Night of Culture  on ITV.

04:44.720 --> 04:49.760
Straight after  Emmerdale Farm.
Imagine the viewers.

04:49.840 --> 04:50.920
[dramatic music]

04:51.000 --> 04:55.080
Jane, I...
I've never done any live television.

04:55.160 --> 04:58.360
What are you talking about?
You did it this morning, you cretin.

04:58.440 --> 05:00.920
What, ten minutes on  Lorraine?

05:01.000 --> 05:02.880
And I was half boozed.

05:02.960 --> 05:06.480
Three hours of intense Shakespeare
is a different box of cheese!

05:06.560 --> 05:11.080
Indeed. Who could forget
when dear old Patrick Stewart...

05:12.400 --> 05:15.040
How was  Lorraine  this morning, anyway?
I missed it.

05:15.120 --> 05:16.800
No idea, I was pissed.

05:16.880 --> 05:18.160
[phone buzzes]

05:20.480 --> 05:22.920
Jane, your phone's actually lit up.

05:23.960 --> 05:26.240
-I've never seen it do that before.
-Very quiet.

05:30.840 --> 05:32.640
This is Jane Plough speaking.

05:35.520 --> 05:37.320
Who am I talking to, please?

05:37.400 --> 05:38.800
What's this in reference to?

05:40.360 --> 05:42.320
[whispers] Who is it?

05:42.400 --> 05:44.840
-Well, I'll have to speak to him myself.
-Who?

05:44.920 --> 05:46.360
No comment.

05:46.440 --> 05:47.480
Who was that?

05:49.000 --> 05:51.120
Do you remember telling a story
about Stanley Kubrick

05:51.200 --> 05:53.560
-to Lorraine this morning, Toast?
-[phone rings]

05:53.640 --> 05:55.440
I couldn't have been
that pissed, could I?

05:56.520 --> 06:00.360
-Just answer the question.
-[phone rings]

06:00.440 --> 06:02.200
I may have told her the story.

06:02.280 --> 06:04.640
-The story?
-[phone rings]

06:06.160 --> 06:07.520
[Jane sighs]

06:07.600 --> 06:08.680
Go on then.

06:09.680 --> 06:12.560
Well, it was a few years ago now.

06:12.640 --> 06:15.160
1969, to be precise.

06:15.240 --> 06:19.120
I was at Pinewood Studios
doing some low-budget film.

06:19.200 --> 06:21.320
Some sex comedy, probably.

06:21.400 --> 06:24.640
Anyway, I smoked a hell of a lot
of grass back then

06:24.720 --> 06:27.760
and would frequently
not remember what I was doing.

06:28.360 --> 06:31.560
I was supposed to meet someone at Stage
B,

06:31.640 --> 06:33.560
but I foolishly walked into Stage D.

06:34.480 --> 06:37.480
I mean, I really was cock
of the walk back then.

06:37.560 --> 06:40.560
I paid no mind to any rules or regs.

06:40.640 --> 06:43.960
You might call me an easy ride-e-er.

06:44.040 --> 06:46.920
-Get on with it, Toast.
-All right.

06:47.000 --> 06:50.240
Anyway, I wandered through the back door,

06:50.320 --> 06:54.320
but failed to notice a large
"keep out" sign and red recording light

06:54.400 --> 06:58.120
as I made my way
into the vast film studios.

06:58.200 --> 07:00.880
It could have been something to do
with the amount of Children in Need

07:00.960 --> 07:06.160
I was smoking, but the very next thing
I knew, I was walking on the moon.

07:06.240 --> 07:09.160
I could even see a couple
of astronauts waving at me

07:09.240 --> 07:11.680
and the Apollo 11 space module.

07:11.760 --> 07:13.280
Hey, Cut. Hey!

07:13.360 --> 07:15.120
-But out of nowhere...
-Hey, you!

07:15.200 --> 07:19.000
...a parka-wearing hairy man
whom I recognized as Stanley Kubrick

07:19.080 --> 07:21.680
slammed me hard against a wall.

07:21.760 --> 07:24.560
-Who are you?
-He demanded to know who I was.

07:24.640 --> 07:26.200
Steven Toast?

07:26.280 --> 07:29.520
When I informed him,
he berated me in an angry fashion.

07:29.600 --> 07:32.400
If you ever breathe a word
about what you've just seen,

07:32.480 --> 07:36.680
I guarantee
you'll be tracked down and killed.

07:37.920 --> 07:39.840
If I ever hear of you again...

07:40.960 --> 07:42.320
-you're dead!
-[groans]

07:42.400 --> 07:45.000
-And another thing...
-Now, get the fuck off my set!

07:45.080 --> 07:47.120
After Kubrick had finished berating me,

07:47.200 --> 07:50.720
I noticed a stern-looking man
in the doorway watching

07:50.800 --> 07:54.320
-was none other than--
-Richard "Tricky Dicky" Nixon.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.360
Well, how in hell did you know that?

07:56.440 --> 08:00.120
Very lucky guess. How amazing!

08:00.200 --> 08:04.160
The actual president
of the United States! [gasps]

08:05.520 --> 08:07.560
-Know what you've done, don't you, Toast?
-No.

08:07.640 --> 08:11.480
On a live television program,
watched by possibly millions,

08:11.560 --> 08:14.440
you cheerfully admitted
to having witnessed something

08:14.520 --> 08:17.920
that could not only bring down
the US government,

08:18.000 --> 08:21.240
but could also destroy the entire world.

08:25.400 --> 08:27.720
Could I use your toilet facilities?

08:30.000 --> 08:33.000
[grunts]

08:38.360 --> 08:40.480
It's no good.
These pickled onions are always tricky.

08:40.559 --> 08:44.000
Well, maybe Ray'll be able
to get it off later.

08:44.080 --> 08:46.440
I very much doubt that. [laughs]

08:48.960 --> 08:51.640
There! That looks great.

08:55.040 --> 09:00.160
[exhales] This whole Kubrick thing,
it's a most peculiar business.

09:00.240 --> 09:03.280
Well, you are under enormous pressure
at the moment, Toast.

09:03.360 --> 09:04.960
Maybe you hallucinated it.

09:05.040 --> 09:07.640
Of course I bloody didn't.
You can't hallucinate the past.

09:07.720 --> 09:08.720
I know what I saw.

09:08.800 --> 09:13.440
I'm sure it's connected to you doing
this Shakespeare in the Park live on TV.

09:13.520 --> 09:15.640
-How?
-Some kind of nervous reaction

09:15.720 --> 09:18.840
related to stage fright
has induced a false memory.

09:18.920 --> 09:22.320
It can do odd things.
Who can forget dear old Patrick Stewart?

09:24.680 --> 09:26.560
Hmm, maybe.

09:26.640 --> 09:28.680
Anyway, where were we?

09:28.760 --> 09:31.720
You were trying to get the lid
off my pickled onions.

09:31.800 --> 09:34.640
Maybe I've got some pickled onions
of my own that need releasing.

09:34.720 --> 09:37.400
-[Mrs. Purchase] Hmm...
-[laughs]

09:40.320 --> 09:42.960
[Ray] He's just such an arsehole.
Can you believe it?

09:43.040 --> 09:45.040
-The moon landings.
-The moon landings.

09:45.120 --> 09:48.160
Kubrick, a breakdown live on  Lorraine.

09:48.240 --> 09:50.760
-Unbelievable.
-Any sign of Peggy?

09:50.840 --> 09:52.040
[Ray] Peggy?

09:53.200 --> 09:55.640
I don't think even
legendary theater director Peggy Plywood

09:55.720 --> 09:57.240
can help you out of this one, Toast.

09:57.320 --> 09:59.280
Ray bloody Purchase.

09:59.360 --> 10:01.320
Anyone got a number
for the men in white coats?

10:01.400 --> 10:03.440
[woman laughs]

10:03.520 --> 10:04.800
[Ray] Walking on the moon.

10:04.880 --> 10:07.920
Really, Toast?
You've trumped yourself this time.

10:08.000 --> 10:12.200
And you chose to have your meltdown
live on  Lorraine.  Just brilliant. [laughs]

10:12.280 --> 10:16.600
Shut up, Ray Purchase!
For those with your minds on other things,

10:16.680 --> 10:19.560
may I remind you that in 30 hours' time,

10:19.640 --> 10:23.960
you'll be on stage
in one of Shakespeare's greatest plays!

10:24.040 --> 10:29.000
Which is also being broadcast
live to the nation on ITV.

10:29.080 --> 10:32.080
-Oh, God.
-Of course, Peggy, I'm so sorry if I--

10:32.160 --> 10:33.960
Shut up, Ray Purchase!

10:35.720 --> 10:41.240
Now, I'd like to look at Banquo's entrance
again before we do the last dress run.

10:41.320 --> 10:44.440
So sort yourselves out!

10:50.880 --> 10:54.120
-Oh, I like this one.
-[cheerful music over headphones]

10:55.520 --> 10:58.240
-Toast.
-[hums along]

11:00.800 --> 11:03.560
-Toast!
-[sings]

11:04.760 --> 11:06.040
[gasps]

11:06.120 --> 11:10.840
Jesus Christ, Peggy. I nearly shat
my gray rehearsal sweatpants!

11:16.120 --> 11:18.000
Judging by the position
of that whisky bottle,

11:18.080 --> 11:19.720
I deduce that you have not yet
been to bed.

11:19.800 --> 11:22.880
I can't sleep, Ed.
My brain's doing somersaults.

11:22.960 --> 11:26.240
I didn't know this Shakespeare play
was going out live on TV.

11:26.320 --> 11:29.560
Of course, live TV. Always quite...

11:29.640 --> 11:31.520
[gasps]

11:32.520 --> 11:34.480
-All right.
-I've known a lot of actors lose it

11:34.560 --> 11:36.720
when they do drama live on television.

11:36.800 --> 11:39.680
I remember Scott Chestnut
once became very racist

11:39.760 --> 11:43.080
-just before he did  Lear  live on BBC2.
-That's right, he did.

11:43.160 --> 11:46.520
Don't worry, Toast.
Most actors would be really scared

11:46.600 --> 11:49.040
about having to do Shakespeare
live on television.

11:49.120 --> 11:51.360
-Really scared.
-I'm not really scared.

11:51.440 --> 11:52.800
-Are you sure?
-Yes.

11:52.880 --> 11:54.640
-Really?
-Yes.

11:54.720 --> 11:58.320
-Re-e-eaally?
-Yes-aah!

11:58.400 --> 12:00.680
And who could forget
when dear old Paddy Stewart...

12:02.440 --> 12:04.600
-[phone rings]
-Paddy...

12:06.360 --> 12:08.720
-Toast.
-Any sign of them yet?

12:08.800 --> 12:11.520
-Who?
-The CIA.

12:11.600 --> 12:15.120
That's presumably who Kubrick meant
when he said they were going to get us.

12:15.760 --> 12:18.440
-[Toast]  Us?
-I'm your agent, Toast.

12:18.520 --> 12:21.360
I know too much.
They'll take me out as well.

12:21.440 --> 12:23.440
No. I probably imagined it, Jane.
I mean, I--

12:23.520 --> 12:24.720
We need to be very careful.

12:24.800 --> 12:26.520
Very careful.

12:26.600 --> 12:30.240
I'm going to hang up now.
Phone is probably bugged.

12:30.320 --> 12:31.840
-Jane?
-[dramatic music]

12:36.560 --> 12:39.560
[announcer]  Ladies and gentlemen
of the cast, this is your one-hour call.

12:39.640 --> 12:41.000
One hour please.

12:42.680 --> 12:44.680
-Biscuit?
-Mm.

12:44.760 --> 12:47.400
[mysterious music]

12:52.320 --> 12:53.640
Um... No, thanks.

12:55.760 --> 12:58.160
[sighs] Patrick Stewart.

12:59.560 --> 13:00.760
Steven Toast.

13:00.840 --> 13:04.720
Doing drama on live TV.
Patrick hated it. I'll never forget...

13:05.640 --> 13:07.360
What the hell does that mean?!

13:07.440 --> 13:09.560
You don't know?

13:09.640 --> 13:12.280
When Patrick did  Hamlet  live on BBC2,

13:12.360 --> 13:15.400
Back in those days,
Patrick had a lovely head of hair.

13:15.480 --> 13:18.720
Bit like yours, Toast. But less weird.

13:18.800 --> 13:21.720
So, it's all going very well
until about the fourth act

13:21.800 --> 13:23.720
when his hair starts falling out.

13:23.800 --> 13:28.120
First in single hairs, then strands,
then whole clumps.

13:28.200 --> 13:32.640
By the time he gets to the castle
in the final act, he's as bald as a coot.

13:32.720 --> 13:35.960
-You're kidding?
-No. There's hair all over the floor.

13:36.040 --> 13:39.240
And all 'cause he was doing Shakespeare
live on TV. [laughs]

13:39.320 --> 13:40.720
God help me.

13:40.800 --> 13:44.120
Yeah, it can affect actors
in all kinds of strange ways.

13:44.200 --> 13:48.200
I've seen one chap start talking backwards
during a live  Corrie.

13:48.280 --> 13:51.320
And Scott Chestnut,
he suddenly became very fascist.

13:51.400 --> 13:52.800
No, racist.

13:54.560 --> 13:58.280
-Why are you clinging on to this pillar?
-I'm not.

14:00.880 --> 14:02.440
And if you don't mind, Peggy...

14:03.880 --> 14:05.320
I'd like to prepare.

-Oh, glad I caught you, Toast.

14:19.960 --> 14:21.920
I think you may have taken my mobile
by mistake.

14:22.000 --> 14:25.320
Oh yeah, that's all right, Ed.
It's right here. I'll just get...

14:25.400 --> 14:27.360
[mysterious music]

14:31.480 --> 14:35.120
Ed, your mobile is in fact
right in front of me,

14:35.200 --> 14:37.480
but I can't reach it
because I can't let go of the pillar.

14:38.120 --> 14:39.560
Can you get here ASAP?

14:39.640 --> 14:41.760
-I think I might have...

OK, thanks, Mrs. Purchase.
Doesn't seem to be working.

This is serious, Ed.
You know what kind of sex appetite I have.

16:14.960 --> 16:16.640
I know you do, but for whatever reason,

16:16.720 --> 16:19.600
you don't seem to be able to break free
from that pillar.

16:19.680 --> 16:23.240
-OK, you can go now, Mrs. P.
-Oh, OK, Ed. Sorry I couldn't do more.

16:23.320 --> 16:25.920
Come on, Toast. Get into costume.
I wanna rehearse the sword fight.

16:26.000 --> 16:29.200
You've not cracked it yet,
and I refuse to look a Tom Fool on stage!

16:31.800 --> 16:34.000

-Oh, grow up, Ray.

-What are you doing in there with Toast?
-Why are you so paranoid all the time?

16:46.160 --> 16:48.200
Absolutely fascinating.

16:48.280 --> 16:50.960
A very similar thing happened
to Roy Castle on  Record Breakers.

16:51.040 --> 16:52.640
He couldn't let go of a fire extinguisher

16:52.720 --> 16:55.200
and we were told not to touch him,
in case he had a heart attack.

16:55.280 --> 16:57.080
-Oh, God.
-Who else knows about this?

16:57.160 --> 16:59.280
-Peggy? The cast?
-Yeah, I mean, well, pretty much.

17:03.280 --> 17:05.760
You couldn't scratch my back
for me could you, Ed? I can't reach.

-Who?
-The American CIA.

17:24.240 --> 17:26.280
-Have they tried to kill you?
-No.

17:26.359 --> 17:29.240
That's good.
We need to be extremely careful.

17:29.320 --> 17:31.040
Look, I can't let go.

17:31.120 --> 17:32.360
You... You can't what?

17:32.440 --> 17:34.160
I can't let go of the pillar.

17:34.240 --> 17:37.680
My God, they must have drugged you
or something.

17:37.760 --> 17:40.160
No, Jane,
I'm pretty sure I've got stage fright.

17:40.240 --> 17:42.760
Nonsense!
The Americans have done this to you

17:42.840 --> 17:45.520

about the moon landings.

It's hard for a chap to swallow his pride,
Ed, but I'm in the shit,

17:56.080 --> 17:58.640
and you mentioned you knew someone
that could possibly help me.

17:58.720 --> 18:02.200
Right, well, I hope he's available.
He's the best in the biz.

18:02.280 --> 18:03.600
Well, that's who I need.

18:03.680 --> 18:06.440

Fantastic.

Stunning work, Colin, mate.
You got it in one.

-Don't you worry, son.

I've cured many actors whose arse
has caved in at the last minute.

and I'm just back from Hollywood.

19:20.440 --> 19:24.440
Been doing a lot of work with Meryl Streep
and her fear of bells.

19:24.520 --> 19:26.920
It's a bit desperate, Alan.

is listen to my voice and my voice alone.

-Spare me this New Age shoeshine.

19:44.320 --> 19:47.440

you'd better get your act together.

I have waited 20 years to play Macduff.

is gonna hunt you down

20:15.040 --> 20:19.640
Yous have got two options here, I reckon.
One, you carry on like you was

20:19.720 --> 20:21.720
and take a chance
that I don't hunt you down

20:21.800 --> 20:24.000
and cut you from arsehole
to breakfast time!

20:25.520 --> 20:27.840

for pulling me off my stroke.
