00:17.717 --> 00:20.252

[Mark]<i> He was on the run</i>

[Gregory] The surveillance

acting very strangely.

Seale it off, I'll check it out.

<i>I looked into the trash bin</i>

02:08.361 --> 02:10.028

02:13.066 --> 02:15.200
So, I opened the lid
and I looked inside

02:15.301 --> 02:17.436

it was not a child.

02:18.638 --> 02:20.672

02:20.773 --> 02:22.508

He was lying on its left side,

02:26.112 --> 02:27.546

02:36.055 --> 02:39.525
with dark hair
that appeared to be damp.

02:39.626 --> 02:41.226
<i>Due to the lack of decomposition</i>

02:41.327 --> 02:42.961
<i>in the victim's body, we knew</i>

02:43.062 --> 02:45.063
<i>it had not been dead
all that long.</i>

02:45.165 --> 02:47.032
[ominous music playing]

02:49.302 --> 02:52.304
The body did show signs

02:52.405 --> 02:54.373
<i>She was nude
so there was no clothing</i>

02:54.474 --> 02:57.142
<i>that you could
possibly use to track.</i>

02:58.411 --> 03:00.846
[Gregory] And I could tell
that her face was swollen.

03:00.947 --> 03:03.048
<i>She had been beaten pretty bad.</i>

03:04.050 --> 03:06.118
And I'm looking at here hand
and I'm thinking

03:06.219 --> 03:08.453
there's something wrong
with her fingernails.

03:09.789 --> 03:11.690
<i>And as I looked closer
I could tell</i>

03:11.791 --> 03:13.525
<i>those were bones.</i>

03:14.494 --> 03:17.696
<i>And I quickly realized
after at that point,</i>

03:17.797 --> 03:21.233
all the fingertips
had been cut off at the joint,

03:21.334 --> 03:23.769
<i>the thumb,
the fingers on both hands.</i>

03:23.870 --> 03:26.972
<i>All of a sudden my thought

03:27.073 --> 03:29.241
<i>this is a crime
of a whole new level.</i>

03:29.342 --> 03:31.777
And I also realized
at that moment,

she's not gonna have any teeth.

[Thomas]<i> Removing the teeth</i>

to keep that identification

03:42.589 --> 03:45.457

03:51.431 --> 03:52.698
We live in Southern California,

03:52.799 --> 03:54.733
so I started thinking
the cartel.

03:54.834 --> 03:56.635
I started thinking
a serial killer.

03:56.736 --> 04:00.138
<i>I started thinking all these
horrific possibilities</i>

04:01.341 --> 04:05.310
<i>to mutilate this young female</i>

04:05.411 --> 04:06.845
<i>in this manner.</i>

04:06.946 --> 04:09.881
I mean, it was just brutal.

04:09.949 --> 04:12.117
[Thomas]<i> We really</i>

But there was no

desk of the hotel.

12:01.987 --> 12:05.457
<i>Ryan and Jasmine
kinda walked past it.</i>

12:07.059 --> 12:10.061
[dramatic music playing]

12:11.397 --> 12:13.765
[Thomas]<i> Then,</i>
<i>Ryan walks back to the desk</i>

12:13.866 --> 12:16.935
and engages the hotel
staff person for his room.

12:17.036 --> 12:19.471
[dramatic music playing]

12:25.978 --> 12:28.646
They check him in,
he signed something.

12:29.982 --> 12:31.616
<i>He gets the keys</i>

12:31.717 --> 12:34.052
<i>and then he walks away.</i>

12:36.155 --> 12:38.723
[Gregory] Try the next camera.

12:38.824 --> 12:41.826
[dramatic music playing]

12:46.966 --> 12:49.400
[Gregory] You see them
start to get in an elevator.

12:54.840 --> 12:57.442
<i>Then you see them get out
of the elevator real fast,</i>

12:59.278 --> 13:00.578
and it looks like they're asking

13:00.679 --> 13:01.880
where their room is.

13:01.981 --> 13:04.315
So, the elevator
was obviously a mistake.

Move on, try the next camera.

13:09.789 --> 13:12.423

<i>which is on the bottom floor.</i>

13:18.631 --> 13:20.465
And that's it,
they're in the room.

13:21.834 --> 13:23.835
[Gregory]<i> According</i>
<i>to the surveillance footage</i>

13:23.936 --> 13:26.638

they both get to the room

13:26.739 --> 13:28.706

[narrator]
<i>Detectives keep watching.</i>

13:34.747 --> 13:36.481
[Corey]
It's quite labor-intensive.

You have to sit there
and watch hours and hours

13:39.218 --> 13:40.919
<i>and hours of video.</i>

13:48.127 --> 13:49.828

both in their late 20s, 30s.

14:15.487 --> 14:17.155
<i>You know, it's sad
to think that that was</i>

14:17.256 --> 14:19.858

<i>so they conduct a search</i>

<i>We have our forensic unit</i>

14:36.175 --> 14:38.243
<i>respond out</i>

14:38.344 --> 14:39.777

<i>the sink, the shower.</i>

14:41.614 --> 14:43.214
<i>They processed the bedding.</i>

14:44.850 --> 14:46.384
[Thomas]<i> The investigators</i>
<i>need to see</i>

15:38.938 --> 15:41.706
with Ryan
to the poker tournament.

15:41.807 --> 15:43.207
<i>Another thing
that we learned is that</i>

<i>the management arranged
for a limo</i>

15:45.577 --> 15:48.313
<i>to take them
to the gaslight district</i>

15:48.414 --> 15:49.647

23:08.253 --> 23:10.588
[narrator]<i> Robert confirms</i>
<i>that he and Jasmine</i>

23:10.689 --> 23:12.723
<i>had stayed in contact.</i>

23:14.693 --> 23:15.993
[Gregory] He was very distraught

23:16.094 --> 23:17.828
over what had happened.

23:17.929 --> 23:19.397
<i>Obviously,
he cared about Jasmine</i>

23:19.498 --> 23:21.065
<i>a great deal.</i>

23:21.166 --> 23:23.000
[man] When did you last hear
from her?

23:24.136 --> 23:26.804
The night they went
to play poker.

23:26.905 --> 23:28.105
[Corey] <i>Robert was in Las Vegas</i>

23:28.206 --> 23:30.875
<i>and, uh, Jasmine
had indicated to him</i>

23:30.976 --> 23:32.376
that she would go
to Burbank Airport

23:32.477 --> 23:34.545
and maybe he could
get his private jet

23:34.646 --> 23:37.314
to come and pick her up
and fly her to Las Vegas.

23:39.451 --> 23:41.819
[narrator]<i> Robert claims</i>
<i>that was the last</i>

23:41.920 --> 23:43.220
<i>he heard from Jasmine.</i>

23:43.321 --> 23:45.790
[Gregory]<i> We spoke to him,</i>
<i>solid alibis.</i>

23:47.159 --> 23:49.293
Robert wasn't even
in California.

23:49.394 --> 23:50.861
He was in Nevada at the time.

23:52.330 --> 23:53.731
Okay.

23:53.832 --> 23:55.666
I think we're done.

23:55.767 --> 23:57.501
[Corey] We didn't think
that he was involved

23:57.602 --> 23:59.136
whatsoever
in the murder of Jasmine.

24:03.875 --> 24:05.543
[Thomas]
<i>The investigators requested</i>

24:05.644 --> 24:08.245
<i>the recovery of evidence
from the wardrobe</i>

24:08.346 --> 24:10.047
<i>covered in the hallway.</i>

24:10.148 --> 24:12.483
At the time, we didn't even know

24:12.584 --> 24:14.552
what the object was.

24:14.653 --> 24:16.153
<i>Was it the murder weapon,</i>

24:16.254 --> 24:18.589
<i>was it used in the homicide?</i>

24:20.459 --> 24:22.159
<i>Is it something related</i>

24:22.260 --> 24:24.628
<i>to Jasmine or Ryan</i>

24:24.729 --> 24:27.965
<i>that could lead
to Ryan's location?</i>

24:38.076 --> 24:39.910
[Gregory] So we look on top
of the [indistinct]

24:40.011 --> 24:41.245
And it's a phone receiver.

24:42.514 --> 24:45.382
<i>So in my mind I'm thinking,
why would anyone take</i>

24:45.484 --> 24:48.219
<i>the phone receiver
from the hotel phone,</i>

24:48.320 --> 24:51.322
unplug it from the phone
and set it outside,

24:51.423 --> 24:53.424
and then go get ice?

24:53.525 --> 24:56.160
[Thomas]<i> It was taken</i>
<i>to the forensic lab</i>

24:56.261 --> 24:58.829
<i>and examined
for any fingerprints,</i>

24:58.930 --> 25:01.899
any evidence
that it may have been used

25:02.000 --> 25:03.634
<i>in the crime.</i>

25:06.671 --> 25:08.339
[narrator]<i> Investigators</i>
<i>take another look</i>

25:08.440 --> 25:10.541
<i>at Jasmine and Ryan's room.</i>

25:12.244 --> 25:15.179
[Thomas] At the back
of the room was a sliding door

25:15.280 --> 25:17.414
that led to a private patio

25:17.516 --> 25:19.817
<i>that backed up
to the parking lot</i>

25:19.918 --> 25:21.652
<i>of the hotel.</i>

25:21.753 --> 25:23.521
[Corey]<i> You were able to go</i>
<i>outside of the room</i>

25:23.622 --> 25:26.390
onto a patio area with a small,

25:26.491 --> 25:29.226
<i>like a two-foot high wall
around it.</i>

25:29.327 --> 25:31.228
<i>One could step over the wall</i>

25:31.329 --> 25:33.764
<i>to get into the outside
parking lot.</i>

25:36.835 --> 25:38.435
[Gregory]<i> On the back patio,</i>

25:38.537 --> 25:41.272
<i>they found a spot of blood
with a long hair in it.</i>

25:43.909 --> 25:45.709
<i>And after processing</i>

25:45.810 --> 25:48.078
the blood spot and the hair,

25:48.179 --> 25:50.180
DNA evidence showed
that did belong

25:50.282 --> 25:51.482
to Jasmine Fiore.

25:54.719 --> 25:57.655
[theme music playing]

25:59.491 --> 26:00.758
[Gregory] <i>Based on the evidence,</i>

26:00.859 --> 26:02.860
we know that her blood and hair

26:02.961 --> 26:05.429
is found in the back patio area.

26:05.530 --> 26:07.398
<i>But from the video evidence,</i>

26:07.499 --> 26:09.700
we don't see Jasmine, we don't
know where Jasmine is.

26:10.769 --> 26:11.835
[man] Okay, scroll on.

26:11.937 --> 26:14.071
See if he comes back out.

26:14.172 --> 26:16.173
Gotta be something here.

26:24.249 --> 26:25.583
Pause it there.

26:27.285 --> 26:29.286
Is that their stuff?

26:29.387 --> 26:31.622
Wind it back, slow it down,

26:31.723 --> 26:33.924
and zoom in.

26:34.025 --> 26:37.328
So the next time we see
Ryan Jenkins is at 6:24.

26:41.833 --> 26:43.801
He appeared
to have both his hands full

26:43.902 --> 26:45.569
<i>of clothing and toiletries,</i>

26:45.670 --> 26:47.104
<i>that type of thing,</i>

26:47.205 --> 26:48.405
and he was in a hurry.

26:48.506 --> 26:51.108
[tense music playing]

26:56.681 --> 26:57.915
[Gregory] <i>We then see him return</i>

26:58.016 --> 27:00.117
and he's empty-handed

27:00.218 --> 27:01.518
and he goes back into the room.

27:03.955 --> 27:05.122
What is he doing?

27:16.368 --> 27:19.003
[Gregory] We then see him
leave the room again at 6:51.

27:19.104 --> 27:21.705
Again, we haven't seen Jasmine
at all in this time.

27:33.518 --> 27:35.019
[man] There he is.

27:35.120 --> 27:36.620
Changed his clothes.

27:38.123 --> 27:40.124
So after Ryan leaves,
he's gone for a couple hours

27:40.225 --> 27:41.925
and he doesn't return back
to the hotel room

27:42.027 --> 27:44.261
<i>until 9:09 in the morning.</i>

27:51.136 --> 27:53.237
And then shortly after that
at 9:20,

27:53.338 --> 27:55.139
we see him leave the room again.

27:55.240 --> 27:58.308
[suspenseful music playing]

27:58.410 --> 27:59.643
[narrator]<i> It's the last time</i>

27:59.744 --> 28:02.079
<i>Ryan appears on the CCTV.</i>

28:03.081 --> 28:04.782
No bag, nothing.

28:04.883 --> 28:05.983
No sign of Jasmine.

28:07.485 --> 28:09.687
Can you show me their
arrival again?

28:09.788 --> 28:12.756
[tense music playing]

28:14.426 --> 28:15.826
[Thomas]
<i>When they first arrived,</i>

28:15.927 --> 28:17.995
there was a gray suitcase

28:18.096 --> 28:19.463
that is seen on camera

28:19.564 --> 28:21.465
<i>being placed on the cart.</i>

28:21.566 --> 28:24.535
[tense music playing]

28:24.636 --> 28:26.003
[man] Pause there.

28:26.104 --> 28:27.671
[Gregory]<i> One of the first</i>
<i>things I realized</i>

28:27.772 --> 28:30.240
<i>is one of the bags
is identical to the bag</i>

28:30.341 --> 28:31.442

28:32.944 --> 28:34.578
[Thomas]<i> The gray suitcase</i>

28:34.679 --> 28:36.814
<i>was not seen leaving the room</i>

28:38.416 --> 28:40.884

surveillance.

28:42.487 --> 28:44.254
[Gregory] Ryan Jenkins
never brings any luggage

28:44.355 --> 28:46.323
out from the hotel room

28:46.424 --> 28:49.193
<i>and there was no luggage
found inside the hotel room,</i>

28:49.294 --> 28:50.594
<i>so he had to have taken it out</i>

28:50.695 --> 28:52.896
the back door
to the parking lot.

28:53.898 --> 28:55.332
[Thomas]
<i>Ryan was the last person</i>

28:55.400 --> 28:57.835
that we could identify
with Jasmine

28:57.936 --> 28:59.737
during this time period.

29:00.805 --> 29:02.072
<i>We needed to talk to him</i>

29:02.173 --> 29:03.607
<i>and find him.</i>

[narrator]
<i>To help track him down,</i>

29:08.113 --> 29:11.215
<i>investigators turn
to Jasmine's friends.</i>

29:12.217 --> 29:14.151
[Thomas]<i> She had some</i>
<i>very close friends,</i>

29:14.252 --> 29:17.154
<i>all who were interviewed</i>

29:17.255 --> 29:18.655
<i>for background,</i>

29:18.757 --> 29:21.325

29:21.426 --> 29:23.360
<i>what the situation was.</i>

29:23.461 --> 29:25.162
<i>There was some concern that,</i>

29:25.263 --> 29:27.564
<i>you know, she and Ryan
weren't getting along</i>

29:27.665 --> 29:29.666
because they'd only been
married a short time

29:29.768 --> 29:32.236

going on right now.

29:34.072 --> 29:36.340
She wouldn't just leave
me to deal with it all.

[Gregory]<i> After Ryan</i>

29:37.909 --> 29:39.476

cheating on Jasmine</i>

29:42.981 --> 29:45.682
<i>that caused a rift
in the relationship.</i>

29:45.784 --> 29:48.085
I learned that it was
a turbulent relationship.

29:48.186 --> 29:50.020
Ryan had actually been arrested

29:50.121 --> 29:52.389
in Las Vegas
for domestic violence.

29:53.691 --> 29:55.225
<i>Apparently, he had...</i>

29:55.326 --> 29:57.795
<i>punched Jasmine in the arm</i>

29:57.896 --> 29:59.296
and made her fall in the pool.

29:59.397 --> 30:01.265
The police were called
and he was arrested for that.
