00:15.610 --> 00:17.601
This is troy.
Leave a message.

00:17.610 --> 00:19.442
Are you home?
Pick up.

00:19.450 --> 00:21.316
I need food.
I want to order something.

00:21.320 --> 00:23.778
I am craving guacamole.

00:23.790 --> 00:25.849
I'm pulling up.

00:32.659 --> 00:35.425
[cell phone ringing]

00:36.300 --> 00:37.119
Hello?

00:37.130 --> 00:39.519
Man: I see you made
it home, kate.

00:42.640 --> 00:45.200
Please leave me alone.

00:55.020 --> 00:56.875
Sorry.

[screaming]

01:25.710 --> 01:27.178
No! No! No!

01:27.180 --> 01:30.343
No! No! Aah!

01:30.350 --> 01:33.183
[honking horn]

01:33.190 --> 01:36.911
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:36.930 --> 01:42.255
Please, somebody!
Aah! Aah! Aah!

01:42.260 --> 01:43.352

01:43.370 --> 01:45.361
Aah! Ohh!

01:45.370 --> 01:48.499
[screaming]

01:59.050 --> 02:01.610
No! No!

02:01.620 --> 02:03.918
Somebody, help me!

02:03.920 --> 02:05.809
Aah!

02:08.789 --> 02:11.657
[wheezing]

02:34.580 --> 02:36.912
Woman: Over 6 million people
are stalked each year

02:36.920 --> 02:39.389
In the United States.

02:41.620 --> 02:46.251
1 in 6 women,
1in 19 men.

02:46.260 --> 02:49.150
Stalking is the unwanted
or obsessive attention

02:49.170 --> 02:50.626
From one person to another.

02:50.630 --> 02:56.399
It's driven by rejection,
jealousy, revenge.

02:57.770 --> 03:00.262
[door opens]

03:00.280 --> 03:01.304
Hi.

03:01.310 --> 03:02.471
I'll take your bag,
all right?

03:02.480 --> 03:04.335
I'm gonna get you
early, ok?

03:04.350 --> 03:06.546
Ok. How early?

03:10.620 --> 03:12.145
Woman: Stalking can be
the result

03:12.150 --> 03:13.288
Of a relationship gone wrong

03:13.290 --> 03:17.158
Or delusional fixations
that are pushed to extremes.

03:17.160 --> 03:19.822
Anyone can be a stalker--

03:19.830 --> 03:23.789
Ex-boyfriend,
spouse, stranger.

03:23.800 --> 03:27.293
Anyone can be a victim,
and it's on the rise.

03:27.300 --> 03:31.134
Facebook, twitter, instagram,
snapchat, tinder,

03:31.140 --> 03:32.460
Whatever app is hot today,

03:32.470 --> 03:35.337
We have too much access
to one another.

03:35.340 --> 03:37.308
Social media is
the number one reason

03:37.310 --> 03:41.577
Stalking cases have tripled
in the last decade.

03:50.230 --> 03:51.527
That's where I come in.

03:51.530 --> 03:54.227
I run tau,
the threat assessment unit

03:54.230 --> 03:55.322
Of the lapd.

03:55.330 --> 03:57.697
We are responsible
for all stalking cases

03:57.700 --> 03:59.168
And threats to individuals,

03:59.170 --> 04:01.889
As well as politicians
and city employees.

04:01.900 --> 04:04.494
It is our job to assess
the level of threat

04:04.510 --> 04:09.334
In any situation
and respond accordingly.

04:09.350 --> 04:13.002
Have I lost you?
I'm seeing eyes glaze over.

04:13.020 --> 04:15.512
How about this?
Any questions for me?

04:15.520 --> 04:17.511
Did you handle the
selena gomez stalker?

04:17.519 --> 04:19.339
Second woman: I heard
david letterman had a stalker

04:19.360 --> 04:20.350
For over a decade,

04:20.360 --> 04:23.057
Some lady who kept
breaking into his house.

04:23.060 --> 04:24.926
No, I didn't,
and, yes, he did,

04:24.930 --> 04:29.720
But celebrity stalking makes up
only 10% of all stalking cases.

04:29.730 --> 04:33.428
Most victims are like
you and me.

04:46.910 --> 04:48.674
[elevator dings]

04:49.550 --> 04:51.541
Good morning. The
lab work came back

04:51.550 --> 04:52.711
On the mayor's
bloody cake.

04:52.720 --> 04:54.381
It was red food dye
mixed with maple syrup.

04:54.390 --> 04:55.710
You were right.
It was a prank.

04:55.720 --> 04:56.710
Call the mayor's office?

04:56.730 --> 04:58.050
Yes, and the mayor
wants to talk to you.

04:58.060 --> 04:59.550
He scares so easy.
I'll call him.

04:59.560 --> 05:01.449
Homicide has more on
yesterday's burbank shooter.

05:01.460 --> 05:05.397
- Turns out it was a city
employee targeting street workers.

05:05.400 --> 05:06.561
I'm up.

05:06.570 --> 05:07.628
Can I do
the assessment?

05:07.640 --> 05:09.392
You can share it
with janice.

05:09.410 --> 05:11.902
Janice, can you do
background for me?

05:11.910 --> 05:14.561
Two boys at
alcott university--

05:14.580 --> 05:15.809
Eric bates,
perry whitley.

05:15.810 --> 05:17.403
Good morning.
Is this a new case?

05:17.410 --> 05:19.970
It's a favor to the dean.
I have to see her later.

05:19.980 --> 05:22.142
Woman: Detective larsen
is here.

05:22.150 --> 05:24.471
Detective larsen,
transfer, the new guy.

05:24.490 --> 05:27.812
I put him in the
conference room for now.

05:30.260 --> 05:32.479
He's early.

05:34.460 --> 05:37.100
Hi. I'm
lieutenant beth davis.

05:37.100 --> 05:39.421
Welcome to L.A.

05:39.440 --> 05:42.091
How you doing?
Detective jack larsen.

05:42.100 --> 05:44.159
Nice to meet you.

05:51.650 --> 05:53.607
What do you know
about him?

05:53.620 --> 05:54.644
From new york,
homicide,

05:54.650 --> 05:56.470
13th precinct,
big personality,

05:56.490 --> 05:57.514
Not for everyone.

05:57.520 --> 06:00.945
Single, never married,
sleeps around.

06:00.960 --> 06:01.779
Good for him.

06:01.790 --> 06:03.110
Slept with some
high-up's wife.

06:03.130 --> 06:04.017
Oh, and he got
the boot.

06:04.030 --> 06:05.623
Apparently he can't
help himself.

06:05.630 --> 06:08.691
Beth is gonna
hate him.

06:08.800 --> 06:12.464
Beth: 9 years
nypd homicide.

06:12.470 --> 06:15.132
Good record, decorated.

06:15.140 --> 06:16.289
Why the stalkers unit?

06:16.310 --> 06:20.201
Well, I was hoping to
meet scarlett johansson.

06:21.680 --> 06:23.705
It's an entirely
different skill set.

06:23.710 --> 06:24.802
Our goal is to
prevent crime,

06:24.810 --> 06:26.801
So there's a lot of case
management involved.

06:26.820 --> 06:29.016
A background in mental
illness IS necessary.

06:29.020 --> 06:30.010
Have you read
the manual?

06:30.020 --> 06:31.317
No, but I watched
"fatal attraction,”

06:31.320 --> 06:32.845
"obsessed," "my bodyguard,”

06:32.860 --> 06:34.988
"cape fear," "swimfan."

06:34.990 --> 06:36.151
Yes, I read the manual.

06:36.160 --> 06:37.389
That was--that was
a joke,

06:37.390 --> 06:38.880
And I'm well versed
in mental illness,

06:38.890 --> 06:40.187
Everything from
schizophrenia,

06:40.200 --> 06:41.725
Narcissism,
bipolar disorder,

06:41.730 --> 06:44.995
Delusional psychosis--
my own!

06:45.000 --> 06:46.991
Another joke.

06:47.000 --> 06:48.661
I get it.
I totally get it.

06:48.670 --> 06:52.834
It's a very specific whack job
that stalks and makes threats.

06:52.840 --> 06:54.569
Again, why do you want
to be in this unit?

06:54.580 --> 06:59.074
I filled out the paperwork,
my transfer was processed.

06:59.080 --> 07:00.172
-Am I wrong?
-No.

07:00.180 --> 07:01.841
Because this was starting
to feel like an interview.

07:01.850 --> 07:03.545
There are currently 6
detectives in the unit.

07:03.550 --> 07:06.542
Each detective is responsible
for his own caseload,

07:06.560 --> 07:08.688
But we're a small unit,
so we work together.

07:08.690 --> 07:09.851
You'll tale me
for a month,

07:09.860 --> 07:11.009
And then I'll
turn you loose.

07:11.030 --> 07:13.226
Did I, uh--did I
say something wrong?

07:13.230 --> 07:14.083
What do you mean?

07:14.100 --> 07:15.556
I'm getting a vibe
like I just made

07:15.560 --> 07:16.698
A really bad
first impression.

07:16.700 --> 07:18.429
I know the scarlett
johansson comment was--

07:18.430 --> 07:19.226
-A vibe?
-Yeah.

07:19.230 --> 07:20.561
Like you don't
like me.

07:20.570 --> 07:21.765
Don't be silly.

07:21.770 --> 07:23.363
I'm sporadically rude.

07:23.370 --> 07:25.759
[knock on door]

07:27.070 --> 07:30.108
Homicide dumped
a murder on us.

07:31.050 --> 07:33.701
Hi. I'm janice lawrence.

07:33.720 --> 07:35.074
Nice tie.

07:35.080 --> 07:36.377
Woman was murdered
last night.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.210
Kate edwards--
single, 28,

07:38.220 --> 07:39.949
Burned alive
in her car.

07:39.960 --> 07:42.554
<i>Ben caldwell.
Nice to meet you.</i>

07:42.560 --> 07:43.709
Any prior case files?

07:43.730 --> 07:45.289
The victim reported
an intruder in July

07:45.290 --> 07:47.281
And again in October, a
vandalism report a year prior.

07:47.300 --> 07:49.052
She went to the police
several times, hollywood station,

07:49.060 --> 07:50.789
But it was never
classified as stalking,

07:50.800 --> 07:52.222
So never made
its way to us.

07:52.230 --> 07:53.220
All right.
Let's go, new guy.

07:53.240 --> 07:54.935
Time for your
first assessment.

07:54.940 --> 07:57.432
Reporter: Authorities are
searching for a suspect

07:57.440 --> 07:59.602
In the murder of a young woman
kate edwards,

07:59.610 --> 08:01.908
Who was burned alive
in a fiery explosion.

08:01.910 --> 08:04.072
Sources tell us
the threat assessment unit

08:04.080 --> 08:07.402
Of the |.A. Police department
has been called in

08:07.420 --> 08:08.478
To supervise the case,

08:08.480 --> 08:10.141
And no other details
have been released

08:10.150 --> 08:13.984
Regarding the ongoing
investigation.

08:20.600 --> 08:22.989
We're almost done.

08:36.179 --> 08:38.136
She hasn't been
here very long.

08:38.150 --> 08:39.275
The place is barely
lived in.

08:39.280 --> 08:41.009
Her mail goes
to a mail center.

08:41.020 --> 08:43.114
She's been hiding
from someone.

08:43.120 --> 08:44.849
Because she was
terrified.

08:44.850 --> 08:47.444
In the bathroom, she has
a clear shower curtain

08:47.460 --> 08:49.349
So no one can hide
behind it,

08:49.360 --> 08:51.317
A platform bed
close to the ground

08:51.330 --> 08:53.822
So no one
can hide under it.

08:53.830 --> 08:56.458
She didn't feel safe,
hadn't in a long time.

08:56.470 --> 08:59.792
For an interior designer,
it's not feng shui at all.

08:59.800 --> 09:04.135
The bed should be on
this wall facing the door, no,

09:04.140 --> 09:06.461
But it's over here
because...

09:06.480 --> 09:07.959
She sleeps on the
left side of the bed.

09:07.980 --> 09:11.029
Note the cluttered
side table on her side

09:11.050 --> 09:13.974
Facing the door...

09:13.980 --> 09:18.486
The footsteps of her stalker
to appear under the door.

09:18.490 --> 09:21.050
She had trouble sleeping but
refused to take sleeping pills.

09:21.060 --> 09:23.483
There's a full prescription
from a year ago

09:23.490 --> 09:25.049
Inside the medicine cabinet.

09:25.060 --> 09:27.028
She was too afraid
to sleep.

09:27.030 --> 09:27.986
And her stalker?

09:28.000 --> 09:30.150
It's a man.
Let's face it.

09:30.170 --> 09:32.161
The violence of burning
someone alive

09:32.170 --> 09:34.662
Has us men written
all over it.

09:34.670 --> 09:35.740
He likes role-playing.

09:35.740 --> 09:37.663
He wants his fantasy,
so he breaks

09:37.670 --> 09:39.832
Into her apartment
while she's gone,

09:39.840 --> 09:42.036
Sleeps in her bed,
eats her food,

09:42.040 --> 09:43.838
Watches her tv,
lives in her world.

09:43.850 --> 09:47.002
He would leave little clues so
she would know he was here

09:47.020 --> 09:52.186
<i>Or... Just to
make her crazy.</i>

09:52.190 --> 09:55.683
The predator you described
suffers from eroto-fixation.

09:55.690 --> 09:59.183
He likes the journey.
He doesn't want it to end.

09:59.190 --> 10:00.521
Why kill her?

10:00.530 --> 10:03.192
I don't know yet,

10:03.200 --> 10:07.023
But I impressed you
a little bit, didn't I?

10:07.040 --> 10:09.532
There's a neighbor--
troy gunn.

10:09.540 --> 10:12.100
They were good friends.

10:16.040 --> 10:18.372
Kate on voicemail:
Are you home? Pick up.

10:18.380 --> 10:20.371
I need food.
I want to order something.

10:20.380 --> 10:22.212
I am craving guacamole.

10:22.220 --> 10:24.279
I'm pulling up.

10:25.250 --> 10:26.945
I was here all night.

10:26.960 --> 10:29.759
I had my phone
on silent.

10:29.760 --> 10:30.886
You two were close?

10:30.890 --> 10:32.779
Yeah. Real close
for the past year.

10:32.790 --> 10:35.225
This whole stalking mess
brought us closer.

10:35.230 --> 10:37.927
We met in a spin class
at the gym.

10:37.930 --> 10:39.967
She told me she was being
harassed at the last place.

10:39.970 --> 10:43.736
I told her that--when
next door became available.

10:43.740 --> 10:44.889
She moved in.

10:44.910 --> 10:46.059
Were you two
ever involved?

10:46.070 --> 10:47.231
No. We were just friends.

10:47.240 --> 10:48.230
But you wanted more.

10:48.240 --> 10:51.574
Do all the apartments have
a view of the hollywood sign?

10:51.580 --> 10:54.242
On the north side.

10:54.250 --> 10:55.240
You an actor?

10:55.250 --> 10:56.069
I'm a realtor.

10:56.080 --> 10:57.241
But you came to |.A.
To be an actor.

10:57.250 --> 10:58.786
Yeah. 10 years ago,
but I'm a realtor now.

10:58.790 --> 10:59.939
Was kate involved
with anyone?

10:59.960 --> 11:02.281
The last guy was
over a year ago,

11:02.290 --> 11:05.260
A banker tarry myers.

11:05.260 --> 11:06.284
Didn't last long.

11:06.290 --> 11:07.587
Turns out he was married.

11:07.600 --> 11:08.999
She found out.
She dumped him.

11:09.000 --> 11:10.092
Could I use
your bathroom?

11:10.100 --> 11:12.262
I can't pee next door.
It's a quasi crime scene.

11:12.270 --> 11:13.760
Then you're gonna
have to go hold it.

11:13.770 --> 11:15.295
You're not gonna snoop
through my stuff.

11:15.300 --> 11:17.166
I'm not kate's stalker.

11:17.170 --> 11:19.264
Yes. Hold it, jack.

11:19.270 --> 11:21.102
Did kate ever
suspect tarry myers?

11:21.110 --> 11:23.602
At first. She asked
him point blank.

11:23.610 --> 11:24.600
He denied it.

11:24.610 --> 11:26.100
She didn't want to
falsely accuse him.

11:26.110 --> 11:28.841
He was married
with kids.

11:30.280 --> 11:31.611
Thank you.

11:31.620 --> 11:34.043
[doorbell rings]

11:35.690 --> 11:37.510
Woman: Larry?

11:37.530 --> 11:39.828
Two detectives
are here.

11:39.830 --> 11:42.128
Larry: Sorry to hear
about kate.

11:42.130 --> 11:43.950
Mr. Myers, where
were you last night?

11:43.970 --> 11:46.291
Here all night
with my wife.

11:46.300 --> 11:48.291
When's the last time
you saw kate?

11:48.300 --> 11:49.995
A year ago.
She came to me and asked

11:50.010 --> 11:51.637
If I'd been sending
her these notes and gifts.

11:51.640 --> 11:54.302
I wasn't, but she thought
she was being stalked

11:54.310 --> 11:55.971
And was thinking about
moving because of it.

11:55.980 --> 11:57.971
She never mentioned
anyone she suspected?

11:57.980 --> 11:59.675
No. She suspected me.
She thought I was doing it,

11:59.680 --> 12:01.978
Like I was hung up
on her.

12:01.980 --> 12:03.209
Were you?

12:03.220 --> 12:04.813
I made a mistake
with kate,

12:04.820 --> 12:05.981
But I'm not
the stalker type.

12:05.990 --> 12:07.219
You know, I'm
a married man.

12:07.220 --> 12:08.688
Can your wife confirm
your alibi last night?

12:08.690 --> 12:12.024
Yes, she can, but she
doesn't know about kate.

12:12.030 --> 12:13.486
Why'd you have
an affair?

12:13.500 --> 12:15.559
I'm a miserable
middle-aged man.

12:15.560 --> 12:17.619
It's what we do.

12:20.170 --> 12:22.730
His wife backed him up.
Is she telling the truth?

12:22.740 --> 12:25.163
I don't know.

12:25.170 --> 12:28.003
I was wondering when
that was coming off.

12:28.010 --> 12:29.171
I'm gonna take
you back.

12:29.180 --> 12:32.741
I have one more
appointment.

12:32.750 --> 12:35.742
I'm sorry I stared
at your breasts.

12:35.750 --> 12:37.844
That's why you don't
like me.

12:37.850 --> 12:41.411
When we first met,
I-I looked at your breasts.

12:41.420 --> 12:42.387
Seriously?

12:42.390 --> 12:44.552
That's all I could
come up with.

12:44.560 --> 12:45.857
I was pleasant
and personable,

12:45.860 --> 12:47.350
I showed a reasonable
amount of intelligence,

12:47.360 --> 12:50.227
I'm good-looking,
I have a healthy ego.

12:50.230 --> 12:51.356
The only wrong move
I made was

12:51.370 --> 12:53.862
When my eyes lingered
in your upper torso area

12:53.870 --> 12:55.019
For a second too long

12:55.040 --> 12:56.860
It triggered an instant
dislike for me.

12:56.870 --> 12:58.907
How do I fix that?

12:58.910 --> 13:02.039
Why did you do it?

13:02.040 --> 13:04.737
You're wearing a silk
blouse, hint of a bra,

13:04.750 --> 13:05.876
Red fingernail polish.

13:05.880 --> 13:07.405
I took the male leap that
it was meant to be noticed

13:07.420 --> 13:09.218
And let my eyes linger
in hopes that you

13:09.220 --> 13:10.870
Would be flattered.

13:10.890 --> 13:12.881
I miscalculated.

13:12.890 --> 13:15.655
And it just got worse.

13:18.460 --> 13:20.622
[car starts]

13:24.060 --> 13:27.724
Beth: This was uploaded on
the university's student web site.

13:27.740 --> 13:29.765
You familiar
with this video?

13:29.770 --> 13:32.467
Yeah. I've seen it.
Who hasn't?

13:32.470 --> 13:34.063
But I didn't film it,

13:34.080 --> 13:35.570
And I didn't post it
online.

13:35.580 --> 13:36.979
Do I have to answer
these questions again?

13:36.980 --> 13:38.573
I've been discharged.
I'd like to get to class.

13:38.580 --> 13:40.901
Please, perry.
Detective davis is here

13:40.920 --> 13:41.910
As a favor to me.

13:41.920 --> 13:42.739
We'll be quick.

13:42.750 --> 13:43.979
Guy in the video--
eric bates--

13:43.990 --> 13:46.584
He says you filmed this on
your laptop over a year ago

13:46.590 --> 13:47.910
When you two
were roommates.

13:47.920 --> 13:50.252
No. No. He's just
claiming that

13:50.260 --> 13:52.422
Because it's the best story
he can come up with

13:52.430 --> 13:54.922
He doesn't want to admit
that he showed

13:54.930 --> 13:56.125
His little sex tape
to all his buddies

13:56.130 --> 13:58.155
And then they shared it
with the internet.

13:58.170 --> 13:59.296
You lived together
freshman year,

13:59.300 --> 14:02.338
And then he moved out
in the second semester. Why?

14:02.340 --> 14:05.640
I don't know.
He got weird.

14:05.640 --> 14:08.769
Freshman stress,
was partying a lot.

14:08.780 --> 14:12.307
His mood swings
were insane.

14:12.310 --> 14:14.802
I'm not gonna press
charges, ok,

14:14.820 --> 14:16.515
But guy needs to
chill out.

14:16.520 --> 14:19.114
Why won't you
press charges?

14:19.120 --> 14:21.817
Everybody makes
mistakes.

14:21.820 --> 14:25.950
Eric has problems,
but he's a good guy.

14:25.960 --> 14:29.294
I want to give him
a second chance.

14:29.300 --> 14:30.119
Eric: He's lying.

14:30.130 --> 14:31.791
The guy's
a pathological liar.

14:31.800 --> 14:33.461
I know I shouldn't
have roughed him up.

14:33.470 --> 14:36.496
You put him in the
hospital with a concussion.

14:36.500 --> 14:37.968
And I'm sorry about that,

14:37.970 --> 14:39.631
But the guy's been trouble
ever since

14:39.640 --> 14:42.632
He claims that you made
the video yourself

14:42.640 --> 14:44.199
And showed it
to your friends.

14:44.210 --> 14:45.177
He left his laptop on

14:45.180 --> 14:46.341
And recorded me
and christie.

14:46.350 --> 14:47.476
I would never film
a sex tape.

14:47.480 --> 14:49.175
You were roommates
with him freshman year.

14:49.180 --> 14:51.114
Why'd you move out?

14:51.820 --> 14:53.481
It got too much.

14:53.490 --> 14:55.709
At first, he was cool,
a little nerdy.

14:55.720 --> 14:57.654
He comes
from a good family.

14:57.660 --> 14:59.355
Then stuff started
happening,

14:59.360 --> 15:03.354
Little things
that you can't prove.

15:03.370 --> 15:04.656
Just got weird.

15:04.670 --> 15:05.489
I can't explain it.

15:05.500 --> 15:06.820
You'd catch him
in a small lie,

15:06.840 --> 15:08.831
He wouldn't give you
messages from your friends,

15:08.840 --> 15:10.194
Things like that?

15:10.210 --> 15:12.406
Yeah.

15:12.410 --> 15:13.502
Neither boy is gay,

15:13.510 --> 15:15.535
There are no
sexual undertones here.

15:15.540 --> 15:16.507
Isn't that unusual?

15:16.510 --> 15:18.205
Well, there's more
to stalking than

15:18.210 --> 15:19.848
Just romantic obsession.

15:19.850 --> 15:21.170
Perry's fixated on eric,

15:21.180 --> 15:23.672
Hero worship,
idolization.

15:23.690 --> 15:24.839
But perry's the victim.

15:24.850 --> 15:27.683
Of the attack, but he's
lying about the rest.

15:27.690 --> 15:30.512
Did perry lose a parent or
a sibling at a young age?

15:30.530 --> 15:31.759
His mother
when he was 4.

15:31.760 --> 15:32.921
How did you know that?

15:32.930 --> 15:35.524
Well, loss and rejection
become his comfort zone.

15:35.530 --> 15:37.350
His ex-roommate
rejects him,

15:37.370 --> 15:38.257
And so he seeks it out.

15:38.270 --> 15:39.726
I'm more concerned
about what eric said

15:39.730 --> 15:40.891
About perry's behavior.

15:40.900 --> 15:42.197
That's campus police
jurisdiction.

15:42.200 --> 15:45.238
I can't intervene
unless you invite me in.

15:45.240 --> 15:48.210
But we're gonna keep this
in house for the moment.

15:48.210 --> 15:50.702
Perry's family are
important alumni.

15:50.710 --> 15:52.599
— You'll call me
if something occurs.

15:52.610 --> 15:56.114
Of course. Thanks
for the help, beth.

17:21.300 --> 17:23.029
This day needs
to end.

17:23.040 --> 17:24.666
Tell me about it.

17:24.670 --> 17:25.830
Oht

17:25.839 --> 17:27.898
Thank you.

17:30.810 --> 17:32.676
Bye, lori.
See you tomorrow.

17:32.680 --> 17:35.615
See you. Bye.

17:47.160 --> 17:50.221

17:58.510 --> 18:00.831

18:00.840 --> 18:03.605
Aah! Aah!

18:04.340 --> 18:09.346
Aah! Aah!
Help me! Help me!

18:09.350 --> 18:11.239
[ding]

18:11.250 --> 18:14.709
Help me! Help me!

18:14.720 --> 18:16.484
What happened?

18:28.870 --> 18:32.306
[indistinct chatter]

18:40.750 --> 18:42.946
Get a kiss?

18:46.720 --> 18:50.258
[cell phone ringing]

18:50.260 --> 18:52.957
Hi. Yeah. Yeah.

18:52.960 --> 18:55.224
Tell beth I can meet her.

18:55.230 --> 18:57.619
I'll be right there.

19:03.740 --> 19:06.300
Jack, voice-over: Lori carter,
30, works in finance downtown.

19:06.310 --> 19:07.732
She was attacked
in a parking garage.

19:07.740 --> 19:09.936
First responders
handled the report.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.409
Her eyes suffered
some burns, but she's ok.

19:12.410 --> 19:14.970
She's gonna be
released today.

19:14.980 --> 19:18.610
He's been harassing me
for over a year now--

19:18.620 --> 19:19.940
Letters, gifts.

19:19.950 --> 19:21.782
I thought it was
harmless.

19:21.790 --> 19:23.110
Why didn't you
call the police?

19:23.120 --> 19:24.815
I know the law.
You can't prosecute

19:24.830 --> 19:25.979
Someone for scaring you.

19:25.990 --> 19:27.924
He didn't hurt
or threaten me.

19:27.930 --> 19:29.250
Do you know
kate edwards?

19:29.260 --> 19:32.798
Yeah. Not well. She lived
in my apartment before me.

19:32.800 --> 19:34.768
I took over her lease.

19:34.770 --> 19:35.794
How do you know her?

19:35.800 --> 19:37.632
Through my
spin instructor kurt.

19:37.640 --> 19:38.960
We went to the same gym.

19:38.970 --> 19:41.610
There was a troy who was
friends with kate.

19:41.610 --> 19:43.772
We're going to need
access to your home.

19:43.780 --> 19:44.770
Ok, but why?

19:44.780 --> 19:46.100
You haven't heard
about kate?

19:46.110 --> 19:47.771
I work 80 hours a week.

19:47.780 --> 19:49.771
She's not a close friend.
What?

19:49.780 --> 19:51.817
She was murdered
two nights ago.

19:51.820 --> 19:54.016
Burned alive.

19:56.020 --> 19:56.987
Stay on
this corridor.

19:56.990 --> 19:58.788
I don't want her
alone tonight.

19:58.790 --> 20:01.122
I've seen transference
in stalking before,

20:01.130 --> 20:03.622
But I've never encountered
one man who was stalking

20:03.630 --> 20:05.120
Two women
at the same time.

20:05.130 --> 20:06.291
Dual psychosis maybe?

20:06.300 --> 20:08.166
Well, they lived
in the same apartment,

20:08.170 --> 20:10.138
They went
to the same gym.

20:10.140 --> 20:12.131
How about you go
to the gym,

20:12.140 --> 20:13.460
See who else is
a member there,

20:13.470 --> 20:17.634
I'll meet you at lori's. We
need to find this guy fast.

20:17.650 --> 20:19.539
[music playing]

20:19.550 --> 20:20.972
Man: Come on, you guys.
Don't rest.

20:20.980 --> 20:22.641
Here we go! Let's go!

20:22.650 --> 20:23.845
Do a little harder,

20:23.850 --> 20:25.648
And cool down!

20:25.650 --> 20:28.688
Yeah. I feel great.
You feel good?

20:28.690 --> 20:30.488
Great job, guys.
Great job.

20:30.490 --> 20:32.822
Great class. Great class.

20:32.830 --> 20:34.821
I heard about kate.
Sucks.

20:34.830 --> 20:35.991
She took my class
all the time

20:36.000 --> 20:38.196
<i>Until she moved
into her new place.</i>

20:38.200 --> 20:38.996
And lori carter.

20:39.000 --> 20:41.662
Yeah. I know her, too.
She spins.

20:41.670 --> 20:42.990
I haven't seen her
much lately.

20:43.000 --> 20:44.991
She moved into
kate's old apartment.

20:45.010 --> 20:46.000
Which you told
her about?

20:46.010 --> 20:47.205
Yep. I knew kate
needed someone

20:47.210 --> 20:48.166
To take over the lease.

20:48.180 --> 20:49.579
Out of curiosity,
kurt,

20:49.580 --> 20:52.504
Is wild your
real last name?

20:52.510 --> 20:54.740
The truth, I did
a little softcore

20:54.750 --> 20:55.842
When I first
moved out here.

20:55.850 --> 20:56.840
It's all over the net.

20:56.850 --> 20:58.249
Killed any chance
of an acting career,

20:58.250 --> 21:02.016
But the name stuck,
so I kept it. Heh.

21:02.020 --> 21:04.557
Where you last night
at 10 p.M.

21:04.560 --> 21:09.259
Seriously? I had
a spin class at 8:00,

21:09.260 --> 21:12.525
Did some chest,
a shower, and a steam

21:12.530 --> 21:14.362
And was out of here
right around 10:00.

21:14.370 --> 21:17.032
You know tarry myers?

21:17.040 --> 21:19.702
Yes. He takes my class,
or he did.

21:19.710 --> 21:21.200
I haven't seen him
in a while.

21:21.210 --> 21:22.871
He was friends
with kate.

21:22.880 --> 21:24.575
I don't know
how close they were,

21:24.580 --> 21:26.207
But you should ask troy.

21:26.210 --> 21:27.405
-He would know.
-Troy gunn?

21:27.420 --> 21:30.617
Yeah. Yeah.
He's right over there.

21:33.720 --> 21:36.087
Mr. Gunn, how are you?

21:36.090 --> 21:38.718
Detective, what
are you doing here?

21:38.730 --> 21:40.949
Oh, I'm new to town.
Just checking out the gym.

21:40.960 --> 21:44.055
What is this, some kind
of grieving workout?

21:44.070 --> 21:45.128
What are you
implying?

21:45.130 --> 21:46.393
You know lori carter?

21:46.400 --> 21:47.265
Yeah, I do.

21:47.270 --> 21:50.137
Just like your friend
kate edwards.

21:50.140 --> 21:53.110
Masked man, gas, matches.

21:53.110 --> 21:56.080
Where were you
last night?

21:56.080 --> 21:58.606
Home all by myself,

21:58.610 --> 22:03.150
And, no, I can't
prove it.

22:22.500 --> 22:24.594
Jack: Cool building. I should
have looked in this area.

22:24.610 --> 22:26.430
What's the rent
for a place like this?

22:26.440 --> 22:27.999
I don't know.

22:28.010 --> 22:29.500
Guess who I ran into
at the gym--

22:29.510 --> 22:31.933
Kate's neighbor
troy gunn.

22:31.950 --> 22:33.770
He knows
lori carter, too,

22:33.780 --> 22:35.771
And he has no alibi
for last night either.

22:35.780 --> 22:37.839
"The red dress you wore
last Tuesday was hot.

22:37.850 --> 22:40.785
I like your new haircut.
It really gets me going."

22:40.790 --> 22:41.939
Jack: How could lori
not call the cops

22:41.960 --> 22:44.986
After reading
something like that?

22:44.990 --> 22:46.856
Lori is a strong,
ambitious professional.

22:46.860 --> 22:49.192
Being a victim is
a sign of weakness,

22:49.200 --> 22:51.123
So she chose to
ignore her fears.

22:51.130 --> 22:55.124
It's very human
to dismiss a stalker,

22:55.140 --> 22:57.290
Or worse--accept it
as a part

22:57.310 --> 22:59.563
Of your daily life.

23:02.680 --> 23:03.670
What?

23:03.680 --> 23:05.705
Nothing.

23:12.550 --> 23:13.517
What?

23:13.520 --> 23:15.215
Get up.

23:31.670 --> 23:33.001
What is it?

23:33.010 --> 23:35.934
It's a crawlspace.

23:47.020 --> 23:48.840
What is it? What
are we looking at?

23:48.860 --> 23:52.057
I'm betting we got
prints, dna,

23:52.060 --> 23:55.086
And lots of other
sticky stuff.

24:07.210 --> 24:10.737
It's a secret
viewing room.

24:10.750 --> 24:13.572
So our freak would just
lay up there and watch her.

24:13.580 --> 24:15.571
Above her as if he was
on top of her.

24:15.580 --> 24:18.220
Afis has a match
for a background check.

24:18.220 --> 24:20.211
The prints belong
to a banker.

24:20.220 --> 24:23.850
Let me guess--
tarry myers.

24:42.140 --> 24:45.371
[music playing]

24:51.120 --> 24:53.316
[music stops]

25:01.430 --> 25:02.920
How'd you get
in here?

25:02.930 --> 25:04.295
The r.A. Let me in.

25:04.300 --> 25:06.268
I explained what happened

25:06.270 --> 25:09.661
And came
with a peace offering.

25:11.670 --> 25:13.968
I see you have
a room to yourself now.

25:13.980 --> 25:15.266
Good for you.

25:15.280 --> 25:16.270
You need to leave.

25:16.280 --> 25:18.430
I really want to
work this out, eric.

25:18.450 --> 25:22.444
Come on. 4 stitches,
cracked rib, concussion.

25:22.450 --> 25:24.669
You can listen.

25:28.120 --> 25:29.952
Ok. I'm listening.

25:29.960 --> 25:34.989
Well, first, I just want
to say I forgive you.

25:35.000 --> 25:36.798
I'm not gonna press
charges.

25:36.800 --> 25:40.327
You lost your temper.
I understand.

25:40.330 --> 25:43.038
And?

25:43.040 --> 25:45.691
That's it.

25:45.710 --> 25:51.308
No revenge kick,
no payback?

25:51.310 --> 25:53.472
Payback?

25:53.480 --> 25:56.973
You make me sound like
I'm some vengeful little bitch.

25:56.980 --> 25:59.881
I just want us to be
friends again like before.

25:59.890 --> 26:04.157
Well, we can't
be, perry, not anymore.

26:04.160 --> 26:06.822
How about we just
mind our business

26:06.830 --> 26:09.822
And leave
each other alone?

26:09.830 --> 26:12.049
Fair enough.

26:12.830 --> 26:19.532
Heh. You're--
you're funny.

26:19.540 --> 26:21.838
Payback.

26:21.840 --> 26:25.003
You make me sound
psychotic.

26:25.010 --> 26:27.502
I mean, if I really
wanted revenge,

26:27.520 --> 26:31.479
I would have poisoned
your beer or something.

26:34.020 --> 26:35.249
I'm not out to get
you, eric.

26:35.260 --> 26:40.426
I'm just disappointed
is all.

27:06.390 --> 27:08.381
I didn't kill
kate edwards.

27:08.390 --> 27:09.710
We found fingerprints and semen

27:09.720 --> 27:11.552
In the ceiling's crawlspace
of kate's old apartment.

27:11.560 --> 27:12.925
I believe the semen
has yet to identified.

27:12.930 --> 27:14.557
Regarding
the crawlspace, tarry?

27:14.560 --> 27:15.721
Kate used it for storage.

27:15.730 --> 27:17.220
I helped her move
some boxes up there

27:17.230 --> 27:19.119
My fingerprints
could easily be there.

27:19.130 --> 27:20.723
Lawyer: My client admits
to an affair a year ago

27:20.740 --> 27:23.562
With kate edwards, but he
doesn't even know lori carter,

27:23.570 --> 27:24.890
And it doesn't matter.

27:24.910 --> 27:25.934
He has alibis
for both crimes.

27:25.940 --> 27:27.965
What about the 87 hours
of footage

27:27.980 --> 27:29.402
We confiscated
off your laptop?

27:29.410 --> 27:30.639
What will we find
on that?

27:30.650 --> 27:32.277
Lawyer: I'll have that
thrown out, and you know it.

27:32.280 --> 27:35.147
Charge my client
or let him go.

27:37.920 --> 27:39.069
Jack: We need to talk
to his wife.

27:39.090 --> 27:41.309
The only way to charge
him is disprove his alibis.

27:41.320 --> 27:42.651
She's got to be
lying for him.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.482
Agreed. Did we find
anything on the footage yet?

27:45.490 --> 27:49.324
There's someone
here for you, beth.

27:57.340 --> 28:00.105
It's a lot of footage,
mainly just kate sleeping.

28:00.110 --> 28:02.135
Larry was definitely
stalking kate edwards,

28:02.140 --> 28:03.778
But there's nothing
on lori carter yet.

28:03.780 --> 28:05.475
Sometimes he hid his
camera on the bookshelf.

28:05.480 --> 28:07.608
Gave him a view
of the bathroom.

28:07.620 --> 28:08.439
Beth: What happened?

28:08.450 --> 28:10.270
It's perry.
He's nuts.

28:10.280 --> 28:12.112
He came to see me tonight
to make nice

28:12.120 --> 28:14.646
And then threatened in
that way he does everything.

28:14.660 --> 28:16.617
He can get in my room
whenever he wants.

28:16.620 --> 28:18.179
Wait. The campus police
can't help you?

28:18.190 --> 28:19.112
I've been to them.

28:19.130 --> 28:20.620
All they know is
I kicked his ass.

28:20.630 --> 28:21.950
You know who the guy is.

28:21.960 --> 28:24.292
He's perry whitley
of the whitleys.

28:24.300 --> 28:27.167
They're not gonna
do anything.

28:27.170 --> 28:28.524
I thought
you could help.

28:28.540 --> 28:31.293
Eric, your situation
is tricky.

28:31.310 --> 28:32.300
I did background
on perry,

28:32.310 --> 28:33.664
And he's clean,
which makes this

28:33.670 --> 28:35.502
So much harder to prove.

28:35.510 --> 28:37.000
The first step would be
to get a restraining order,

28:37.010 --> 28:40.002
But I can't do that until
I have concrete proof.

28:40.010 --> 28:43.469
No one gets it. My girlfriend
dropped out of college

28:43.480 --> 28:44.879
And won't talk to me

28:44.890 --> 28:48.144
Because she thinks
I make amateur porn.

28:48.160 --> 28:50.811
My grades have gone
from a 3.0 to failing

28:50.830 --> 28:52.821
Because I can't eat
or sleep

28:52.830 --> 28:56.653
Or do anything because
this guy thinks he owns me.

28:56.660 --> 28:57.491
I know you're scared.

28:57.500 --> 28:59.491
I'm not scared,
I'm mad.

28:59.500 --> 29:01.320
Why won't
someone help me?

29:01.340 --> 29:03.138
[bang]

29:05.240 --> 29:06.059
Should we...

29:06.070 --> 29:08.402
She can handle herself.

29:13.680 --> 29:16.001
Eric, I know
how hard this is,

29:16.020 --> 29:18.842
But we have to
follow the law.

29:18.850 --> 29:20.511
You need to stay calm.

29:20.520 --> 29:22.010
He's not gonna stop.

29:22.020 --> 29:25.411
Now I've aggravated
him more.

29:26.860 --> 29:30.194
I don't want to
live like this.

29:30.200 --> 29:31.520
Nobody gets it.

29:31.530 --> 29:32.349
I get it.

29:32.370 --> 29:34.361
Eric, there is nothing
you're feeling

29:34.370 --> 29:36.361
That I don't know.

29:36.370 --> 29:40.534
Hey. Believe me,
I know.

29:40.540 --> 29:43.202
I've been through this,

29:43.210 --> 29:44.939
Much worse than this,

29:44.950 --> 29:46.577
And it will not get
the best of you

29:46.580 --> 29:49.106
Because it will end.

29:50.220 --> 29:52.678
I'm going to help you.

29:57.290 --> 30:00.282
Eric, if you need anything,
I'm here, ok?

30:00.290 --> 30:02.622
Call anytime.

30:07.400 --> 30:10.131
Ok. I've got something.

30:12.470 --> 30:13.904
It's lori carter.

30:13.910 --> 30:18.279
Larry myers was
stalking both women.

30:18.280 --> 30:21.477
Jack: There he is.

30:21.480 --> 30:24.472
Oh, that's creepy.

30:29.460 --> 30:30.086
Whoa!

30:30.090 --> 30:31.410
There's another person.

30:31.430 --> 30:32.579
Two stalkers?

30:32.590 --> 30:33.421
Larry had a partner.

30:33.430 --> 30:36.422
Keep searching.
Find me a face.

30:36.430 --> 30:39.252
Ben: The second stalker
never appears on camera

30:39.270 --> 30:41.261
In any of the footage.

30:41.270 --> 30:42.328
Did tarry admit
to an accomplice?

30:42.340 --> 30:43.933
No. His lawyer
shut me down.

30:43.940 --> 30:46.136
Jack's trying
to break his wife.

30:46.140 --> 30:49.974
You knew he was
having an affair.

30:49.980 --> 30:52.608
Of course I knew.

30:52.610 --> 30:53.680
I predicted it.

30:53.680 --> 30:55.944
Larry isn't special.
He's right on point

30:55.950 --> 30:57.611
With his midlife crisis.

30:57.620 --> 30:58.940
Started with his
48th birthday.

30:58.950 --> 31:00.440
Suddenly, 50's staring
him in the face,

31:00.450 --> 31:04.455
And he's thinking about
everything he's not gonna be,

31:04.460 --> 31:09.284
The life he wanted,
the one he got instead.

31:09.300 --> 31:10.290
Started going to the gym.

31:10.300 --> 31:13.463
The gym is where he
met kate, right?

31:13.470 --> 31:14.289
I suppose.

31:14.300 --> 31:16.962
He started
staying out late.

31:16.970 --> 31:18.961
I found cocaine
in his pants pocket.

31:18.970 --> 31:21.200
He said it wasn't his
but a friend's,

31:21.210 --> 31:24.635
His new "bro"--
his word.

31:24.650 --> 31:26.300
This friend
have a name?

31:26.310 --> 31:28.176
<i>I don't remember
a Name.</i>

31:28.180 --> 31:29.147
Troy gunn?

31:29.150 --> 31:30.345
No. That doesn't
sound right.

31:30.350 --> 31:31.647
It was more like
a stage name.

31:31.650 --> 31:34.642
This guy was a trainer
at the gym.

31:34.660 --> 31:35.547
Kurt wild?

31:35.560 --> 31:37.016
Yes, that's it.

31:37.020 --> 31:38.158
Jack: They were
playing a game,

31:38.160 --> 31:39.514
Feeding each other's
obsession,

31:39.530 --> 31:42.022
Looking for a pulse,
and tarry finds it--

31:42.030 --> 31:43.725
Courtesy of a failed actor
in need of an audience.

31:43.730 --> 31:46.495
Those two women were props
to their own self-obsession.

31:46.500 --> 31:49.162
Kurt wild's real name
is buford posey.

31:49.170 --> 31:50.399
Good call with
the name change.

31:50.400 --> 31:51.663
Domestic abuse,
two arrests.

31:51.670 --> 31:53.536
Beat up his girlfriend
some years back,

31:53.540 --> 31:55.406
Anger issues,
online gambling conviction,

31:55.410 --> 31:58.505
Juvenile detention
starting at 12.

31:58.510 --> 31:59.739
Larry: Yes, kurt
murdered kate edwards,

31:59.750 --> 32:02.242
And I don't know
where he is.

32:02.250 --> 32:03.513
It was supposed
to be fun.

32:03.520 --> 32:04.510
It was harmless,
you know?

32:04.520 --> 32:05.840
We each picked
a girl to follow.

32:05.850 --> 32:07.409
I picked kate,
he picked lori.

32:07.420 --> 32:08.512
But you dated kate.

32:08.520 --> 32:09.419
He didn't date lori.

32:09.420 --> 32:12.515
Well, kurt was more
into the watching,

32:12.530 --> 32:13.679
But he helped me.

32:13.690 --> 32:14.680
He introduced me
to kate

32:14.700 --> 32:16.395
And showed me how
to flirt with her,

32:16.400 --> 32:18.858
Hit on her, you know,
how to...

32:18.870 --> 32:19.894
Have sex with her.

32:19.900 --> 32:21.061
He coached you.

32:21.070 --> 32:23.232
Yeah. It was like a game
till she found out

32:23.240 --> 32:24.867
I was married
and dumped me,

32:24.870 --> 32:27.202
So kurt suggested

32:27.210 --> 32:29.531
A new game.

32:29.540 --> 32:30.735
Why did kurt want
them dead?

32:30.740 --> 32:32.606
Kate didn't want me,
and lori didn't want kurt,

32:32.610 --> 32:35.204
So he said we should
start over.

32:35.220 --> 32:38.110
Whole new game,
two new picks.

32:38.120 --> 32:40.543
Janice: Kurt is not
at his home or work.

32:40.550 --> 32:41.540
We have an apb out.

32:41.560 --> 32:42.709
Where's lori carter?
Is she save?

32:42.720 --> 32:44.051
She was released
from the hospital

32:44.060 --> 32:46.381
And is being taken
to a friend's house.

32:46.390 --> 32:48.279
Police are with her.

33:06.910 --> 33:09.607
Ma'am, we need to get you
to your friend's house.

33:09.620 --> 33:10.746
I'll just be a minute.

33:10.750 --> 33:13.583
I need to pack
a few things.

33:13.590 --> 33:15.410
Uh, if you
don't mind.

33:15.420 --> 33:16.910
I was gonna change, too.

33:16.920 --> 33:19.150
A compromise.

33:19.160 --> 33:20.855
Ok.

34:00.970 --> 34:02.995
-How the hell did this happen?
-I don't know.

34:03.000 --> 34:04.297
She was changing.
We left the door open.

34:04.300 --> 34:05.961
Beth: Ok. He's not
gonna kill her, not right away.

34:05.970 --> 34:07.631
-He would have done it already.
-He's spiraling.

34:07.640 --> 34:09.301
He's had a psychotic break,
and he's playing the game.

34:09.310 --> 34:10.505
He didn't return
to his house.

34:10.510 --> 34:11.830
Traffic is doing
a video trail.

34:11.850 --> 34:13.306
-What about work?
-Gym's closed at this hour.

34:13.310 --> 34:15.301
That's where he met both
women, where he met tarry.

34:15.320 --> 34:16.879
All available units
urban burn gym

34:16.880 --> 34:19.417
On la brea now.

34:21.989 --> 34:25.380
[lori screaming]

34:36.340 --> 34:37.659
Unh!

34:37.670 --> 34:39.695
Don't do this, kurt.

34:39.710 --> 34:44.670
Do you remember what you
said to me when I asked you out?

34:44.679 --> 34:47.342
You said that you were
seeing someone.

34:47.350 --> 34:50.012
You lied. You think
I didn't know?

34:50.020 --> 34:52.216
I know everything
about you!

34:52.219 --> 34:53.915
We're friends.
We're better as friends.

34:53.920 --> 34:57.754
The game is over.
It has to stop.

34:58.560 --> 35:01.860
No! No!
No, no, no!

35:01.860 --> 35:04.659
[sirens]

35:09.870 --> 35:11.190
Aah! Ohh!

35:11.210 --> 35:12.359
[coughs]

35:12.370 --> 35:15.362
Aah! Aah!

35:15.380 --> 35:16.233
[coughs]

35:16.240 --> 35:18.709
Don't worry.
You won't be alone.

35:18.710 --> 35:20.769
We're gonna do
it together.

35:20.780 --> 35:21.770
[coughs]

35:21.780 --> 35:23.111
[whimpering]

35:23.120 --> 35:26.249
[screaming]

35:26.250 --> 35:28.412
No! No!

35:28.420 --> 35:32.789
Help me! Help me!
Help me!

35:32.790 --> 35:35.225
Man: We got shots fired.

35:35.230 --> 35:37.756
Wait. Wait.

35:37.760 --> 35:39.751
You don't want to
do that.

35:39.770 --> 35:41.864
Jack: Don't move.

35:47.410 --> 35:48.832
Unh!

35:50.080 --> 35:52.799
[lori crying]

35:53.810 --> 35:56.973
Man: Let's go! Stay down!

35:59.250 --> 36:01.412
Janice: They're gonna take
you to the hospital now,

36:01.420 --> 36:03.081
And I'll meet you there.

36:03.090 --> 36:04.580
You're gonna be ok.

36:04.590 --> 36:06.979
Ben: I'll see you
tomorrow.

36:14.600 --> 36:16.762
What, I get nothing?

36:16.770 --> 36:19.796
What is it you want?

36:19.810 --> 36:22.836
I want you
not to hate me.

36:22.840 --> 36:25.605
Can't guarantee that.

36:25.610 --> 36:27.772
All right. Then I'm
just gonna say it.

36:27.780 --> 36:29.305
Why do you wear
sexy things

36:29.320 --> 36:33.109
If you don't want
men to notice?

36:33.120 --> 36:35.646
For how I feel in them.

36:35.660 --> 36:37.310
I dress for myself.

36:37.320 --> 36:38.287
Nice try.

36:38.290 --> 36:39.689
Well, good night.

36:39.690 --> 36:42.523
I thought today
went well.

36:43.660 --> 36:47.198
I know
about new york

36:47.200 --> 36:50.465
And the captain's wife.

36:50.470 --> 36:52.962
Deputy chief's wife.

36:52.970 --> 36:54.699
Oh.

36:58.880 --> 37:02.805
I made a lot of mistakes
in new york,

37:02.820 --> 37:04.640
Some things
I can't undo.

37:04.650 --> 37:06.982
So you come to |.A.
To be a better man??

37:06.990 --> 37:09.982
You do know that most
people are incapable of change?

37:09.990 --> 37:12.482
Well, what can I tell you?

37:12.490 --> 37:15.585
I'm an underdog story.

37:16.830 --> 37:18.491
I apologize if it
it clouded

37:18.500 --> 37:20.229
My initial reaction
to you.

37:20.230 --> 37:21.994
Thank you.

37:22.000 --> 37:24.037
All right. We're done
here. I'd like to go home.

37:24.040 --> 37:26.907
One more thing.
Pure curiosity.

37:26.910 --> 37:30.073
How did you come
to run tau?

37:30.080 --> 37:32.572
Why this division?

37:35.010 --> 37:36.671
Well, I was married.

37:36.680 --> 37:39.672
Had a husband and a kid,
and he cheated on me

37:39.690 --> 37:43.752
She started stalking us,
followed us everywhere.

37:43.760 --> 37:45.216
She showed up
at my kid's school,

37:45.230 --> 37:48.882
She broke into our house,
she boiled the family--

37:48.900 --> 37:51.858
Bunny.

37:51.870 --> 37:54.589
I saw that movie, too.

37:54.600 --> 37:59.697
Come on. It was
a little funny.

37:59.710 --> 38:01.064
Look. Be patient.

38:01.070 --> 38:05.280
I don't put it out there
in the first 5 minutes.

38:05.280 --> 38:07.772
That'd be creepy.

38:09.380 --> 38:11.849
Good night, jack.

38:32.410 --> 38:34.230
What are you doing here?

38:34.240 --> 38:36.231
Walking.

38:36.240 --> 38:37.730
How'd you find me?

38:37.740 --> 38:41.404
It wasn't hard,
perry.

38:41.420 --> 38:43.809
What do you want?

38:43.820 --> 38:44.912
I know what you're doing.

38:44.920 --> 38:46.740
You're trying to
intimidate me.

38:46.750 --> 38:49.720
Unh! What the hell?

38:51.090 --> 38:52.410
[crack]

38:52.430 --> 38:54.751
What I'm doing, perry,
iS warning you.

38:54.760 --> 38:57.149
Stay away from eric.

38:59.100 --> 39:00.261
You can't do that.

39:00.270 --> 39:01.669
What, this?

39:01.670 --> 39:04.093
You're in trouble, lady.
I'm gonna report y--

39:04.100 --> 39:05.170
For what?

39:05.170 --> 39:05.989
Aah!

39:06.010 --> 39:07.330
Stalking a stalker?
Go for it.

39:07.340 --> 39:10.275
You think they're gonna believe
a punk-ass little twit like you?

39:10.280 --> 39:12.840
I can lie better than you,
and they believe me.

39:12.850 --> 39:14.944
They always do.

39:14.950 --> 39:17.112
I am not
under your family's thumb.

39:17.120 --> 39:19.680
I will come for you.

39:23.120 --> 39:25.157
Stay away from eric.

39:25.160 --> 39:27.857
[music playing]

39:38.640 --> 39:42.031
Did you think
I wouldn't find you?

39:48.980 --> 39:52.314
Hey, amanda.

39:52.320 --> 39:56.211
What are you doing here?

39:56.220 --> 39:57.858
New job.

39:57.860 --> 39:59.988
Really? You just chose
[.A. Out of all

39:59.990 --> 40:03.324
The cities in the world?

40:03.330 --> 40:07.164
I saw you
at school today.

40:07.170 --> 40:08.990
Stay away from us, jack.

40:09.000 --> 40:10.695
I moved her to get
away from you.

40:10.700 --> 40:12.668
You stay away
from my son.

40:12.670 --> 40:13.660
Don't you mean
our son?

40:13.670 --> 40:17.334
No. I mean my son.
He's mine, not yours.

40:17.340 --> 40:18.501
Amanda.

40:18.510 --> 40:19.830
I mean it, jack.

40:19.850 --> 40:23.673
You cannot show up here
and ruin my life, not again.

40:23.680 --> 40:25.341
That's not why I'm here.

40:25.350 --> 40:27.944
Leave us alone.

40:29.760 --> 40:32.582
I want to change
my life.

40:32.590 --> 40:34.354
I do.

40:34.360 --> 40:37.557
I don't want to be
the person you remember.

40:37.560 --> 40:40.825
I don't want to be
the man my own son--

40:44.200 --> 40:47.363
I want to change.

40:47.370 --> 40:49.361
Please.

40:49.380 --> 40:52.771
I have a right
to see my son.

40:54.880 --> 40:58.271
Stay away from us, jack.

40:59.590 --> 41:02.309
