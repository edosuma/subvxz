02:33.067 --> 02:34.566
Lucy.

02:35.567 --> 02:39.994
Lucy, calm down. Lucy, calm down.

02:40.770 --> 02:43.362
I... I see something
horrible happening.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.368
You're just having
another nightmare.

02:54.375 --> 02:55.364
I'm scared.

02:55.443 --> 02:57.467
Relax... It's only a bad dream.

05:00.087 --> 05:06.154
Jonathan. You're working too hard.
It's not good for you.

05:06.835 --> 05:08.461
I'm worried about you.

05:59.257 --> 06:00.656
Good morning.

06:04.393 --> 06:07.725
Ah, Harker, please come up here.

06:14.631 --> 06:16.063
Yes, Mr. Renfield.

06:19.966 --> 06:21.990
I have a very important
job for you.

06:24.068 --> 06:27.400
And I don't trust anyone
else to do it, but you.

06:28.137 --> 06:30.195
You're very kind, Mr. Renfield.

06:31.072 --> 06:33.061
Count Dracula...

06:34.473 --> 06:37.236
he sent me a letter
from Transylvania.

06:37.642 --> 06:40.268
He wants to buy a
house around here.

06:41.610 --> 06:45.099
I'm aware that it's a
long trip to go there.

06:45.545 --> 06:46.977
Where is that?

06:48.346 --> 06:50.745
Somewhere over the Carpathian
mountains, isn't it?

06:50.880 --> 06:51.903
Yes...

06:53.182 --> 06:57.173
and there will be a
large commission.

06:57.818 --> 07:00.512
Oh, then I could get a
larger house for Lucy.

07:00.685 --> 07:02.675
She deserves a nicer house.

07:05.052 --> 07:08.043
Well, this won't be easy.

07:08.788 --> 07:10.879
It'll take you a long time...

07:11.756 --> 07:15.052
you'll sweat a lot...

07:16.726 --> 07:17.987
and perhaps you'll also...

07:19.628 --> 07:21.218
spill some blood.

07:29.598 --> 07:32.429
It'll be good for me to
get out of the city...

07:36.101 --> 07:38.090
get away from these canals...

07:39.068 --> 07:41.626
which go nowhere.

07:42.638 --> 07:44.194
Transylvania...

07:44.771 --> 07:47.932
there it is, beyond the forest.

07:49.274 --> 07:51.103
It's a wonderful place.

07:52.241 --> 07:54.639
A little gloomy, maybe,
but very exciting.

07:57.577 --> 08:00.305
The Count is looking for
a beautiful old house.

08:00.844 --> 08:04.107
I'm going to show him the
big house, near your place.

08:04.612 --> 08:08.069
But it's been abandoned for years.
It looks like a haunted house.

08:08.716 --> 08:11.841
I'm sure he'll feel
very comfortable there.

08:13.117 --> 08:17.051
Anyway, we'll offer it to him.
I'd like you to leave soon.

08:17.119 --> 08:19.109
Soon? You mean, today?

08:19.720 --> 08:24.711
Absolutely. I even prepared the papers.
It's bad business to let him wait.

08:29.024 --> 08:30.012
Very well.

08:30.990 --> 08:34.721
If you insist, I shall leave today.

08:40.129 --> 08:41.528
Today? Are you serious?

08:42.630 --> 08:44.460
Yes, to a castle in Transylvania.

08:44.931 --> 08:48.593
I hear it's a strange place infested
with wolves and people who see ghosts.

08:49.199 --> 08:50.688
Jonathan, it scares me...

08:51.100 --> 08:52.623
I don't want you to go.

08:52.701 --> 08:53.724
I'll be fine.

08:54.135 --> 08:55.500
You'll be in danger.

08:56.336 --> 08:58.031
Don't go.

09:08.741 --> 09:12.698
Wolves. Bandits. And ghosts.

09:13.711 --> 09:16.974
Don't go. I won't allow it.

09:19.079 --> 09:23.411
Let's go to the ocean, now.
To the place where we fell in love.

09:27.017 --> 09:28.074
Lucy...

09:31.686 --> 09:35.175
I don't know.
Sometimes I feel so ignorant.

10:36.014 --> 10:39.210
Jonathan, I really
have to say this...

10:40.383 --> 10:43.316
even if you think it comes from...

10:44.150 --> 10:47.016
the weak heart of a woman...

10:47.519 --> 10:48.951
your wife.

10:49.653 --> 10:50.710
Yes?

10:53.254 --> 10:56.188
It really comes from the
strength of my heart.

11:00.291 --> 11:04.020
I feel a kind of...

11:04.291 --> 11:06.754
dark force like a
nameless deadly fear.

11:23.967 --> 11:26.026
Lucy is the dearest thing
in the world to me...

11:26.669 --> 11:29.069
take care of her.

11:32.805 --> 11:34.635
Mina, treat her as a sister.

11:36.941 --> 11:38.101
Yes.

14:12.910 --> 14:16.639
Innkeeper! Quick, my supper. I must go
to the castle of Count Dracula tonight.

14:36.554 --> 14:39.317
Are you really going there?

14:39.955 --> 14:41.478
Yes. Why?

14:42.622 --> 14:45.021
It's not a safe place.

14:45.091 --> 14:49.958
Why do you want to go there?

14:51.728 --> 14:59.426
At midnight evil spirits come out.
And people disappear without a trace.

14:59.497 --> 15:02.090
Oh, come on, that's
all superstition.

15:02.465 --> 15:03.726
Not at all.

15:03.798 --> 15:08.257
Bad things will happen
to you if you go there.

15:08.335 --> 15:11.790
Besides, no coachman will
dare take you there...

15:11.869 --> 15:17.203
your horse needs a
rest for several days.

15:18.073 --> 15:20.130
I'll find another horse.

15:23.474 --> 15:27.136
Don't go, sir.

15:28.077 --> 15:29.474
I know a few gypsies...

15:30.311 --> 15:34.836
who have been on the other side...

15:36.580 --> 15:39.014
and they can tell you.

16:14.864 --> 16:18.525
He also says you shouldn't
go there, young man.

16:39.609 --> 16:44.234
He says there's a great chasm on
the way that swallows the unwary.

16:44.312 --> 16:46.307
If that doesn't get you, he
says the towering crags will.

16:46.513 --> 16:49.400
And in the Borgo pass...

16:49.479 --> 16:53.436
the light suddenly divides and...

16:53.515 --> 16:58.381
the land begins to rise
towards the heavens...

16:58.450 --> 17:01.247
and then it drops. No one has
ever returned from that place.

17:17.324 --> 17:22.192
The gypsies say that no
such castle exists there...

17:22.262 --> 17:25.161
except maybe in the
imagination of man.

17:26.230 --> 17:30.526
There used to be a castle there. But now
it is a ghost castle. It's only a ruin.

17:31.531 --> 17:36.523
And whoever enters into that
land of phantoms is lost...

17:37.367 --> 17:39.800
and never returns.

18:29.024 --> 18:32.924
Of vampires and bloodsuckers.

18:33.258 --> 18:40.353
Of corpses which devour their own flesh.
Of incubuses and succubuses.

18:40.596 --> 18:44.586
Of the living dead who follow
strangers in the night...

18:44.664 --> 18:47.826
and attack them. Hmm...

18:54.035 --> 18:58.231
Transylvania... Nosferatu,
beyond death...

19:00.038 --> 19:02.630
a curse that will last
till the end of time.

19:03.172 --> 19:07.401
The curse of Nosferatu.

19:23.048 --> 19:24.912
Coachman, could you take
me to the Borgo pass?

19:24.982 --> 19:26.415
I'll pay you well.

19:26.884 --> 19:28.941
There is no road to the Borgo pass.

19:31.318 --> 19:33.308
But it's right there.

19:34.886 --> 19:36.444
I need your coach.

19:36.521 --> 19:38.419
I haven't got a coach.

19:41.422 --> 19:44.480
Then I'll take one of your horses.
I'll double the price.

19:44.590 --> 19:46.990
Sorry, sir, but I don't have
any horses. Don't you see?

19:53.528 --> 19:54.551
Well...

19:55.294 --> 19:57.922
I guess I'll have to walk there.

26:32.506 --> 26:34.869
Count Dracula?!

26:39.108 --> 26:43.007
I am Count Dracula.
Welcome to my castle.

26:43.743 --> 26:46.404
You must be Jonathan Harker.

26:46.478 --> 26:47.637
Yes.

26:49.446 --> 26:50.877
Come in.

26:52.280 --> 26:55.908
The night is cold and you
must be tired and hungry.

27:35.734 --> 27:37.858
I've got the papers here.

27:39.834 --> 27:44.030
This is the layout of the house...

27:44.236 --> 27:46.363
which I'm sure you'd like to see.

27:55.341 --> 27:58.434
Yes, yes.

28:00.677 --> 28:02.234
Please, help yourself.

28:03.244 --> 28:05.939
Please, I'm afraid
you must dine alone.

28:06.013 --> 28:10.107
It's nearly midnight and I
partake of nothing at this hour.

28:23.554 --> 28:27.250
Unfortunately, the servants
are not at our disposal.

28:27.657 --> 28:33.114
So allow me to see to your comfort.

29:24.348 --> 29:26.815
Listen.

29:30.618 --> 29:31.606
Listen.

29:32.751 --> 29:35.548
The Children of the
Night make their music.

29:39.988 --> 29:42.079
Ah, young man...

29:43.089 --> 29:47.490
you're like the villagers who cannot place
themselves in the soul of the hunter.

31:33.105 --> 31:35.595
The knife is old and
could be dirty.

31:37.074 --> 31:39.631
It could give you blood poisoning.

31:40.275 --> 31:43.605
Please let me do it. It's the
oldest remedy in the world.

31:43.676 --> 31:46.575
Oh, forget it. It's hardly worth
mentioning. Just a little cut.

31:57.517 --> 32:00.040
You... you know...

32:01.151 --> 32:03.674
it's only for the best.

32:42.836 --> 32:45.701
Let's sit down for a while.

32:53.707 --> 32:56.698
It's still many hours till dawn.

32:57.576 --> 33:00.408
And during the daytime
I am always away.

40:02.898 --> 40:04.887
Lucy, my love...

40:08.267 --> 40:11.256
there is no postal
service from here...

40:11.568 --> 40:17.834
but I shall write a diary, preserving
all my thoughts and feelings for you.

40:18.038 --> 40:23.063
Last night after a tiresome journey,
I finally reached my destination...

40:23.940 --> 40:25.931
the castle of Count Dracula.

40:26.709 --> 40:30.836
I had a bad dream, but
I hope it will pass.

40:31.210 --> 40:33.608
This castle is so strange.

40:34.545 --> 40:38.037
At times I wonder if it
isn't part of that dream.

40:38.114 --> 40:40.740
Everything about it
looks so unreal.

41:19.132 --> 41:22.826
I don't attach importance
to the sunshine anymore...

41:23.433 --> 41:26.060
or to glittering fountains,
which youth is so fond of.

41:27.802 --> 41:30.292
I love the darkness
and the shadows.

41:32.071 --> 41:35.129
Where I can be alone
with my thoughts.

41:43.474 --> 41:45.737
I am the descendent
of an old family.

41:50.313 --> 41:54.077
Time is an abyss, profound
as a thousand nights.

41:56.316 --> 41:58.782
Centuries come and go...

42:00.384 --> 42:03.680
to be unable to grow
old is terrible.

42:04.219 --> 42:08.051
That is not the worst. There are
things more horrible than that.

42:09.921 --> 42:13.752
Can you imagine
enduring centuries...

42:14.789 --> 42:18.781
experiencing the same
futility each day?

42:21.893 --> 42:25.826
I'm glad you found such a
large old house for me.

42:25.894 --> 42:28.589
Very near your
lodging, I understand.

42:28.796 --> 42:31.127
Yes, it's just around the corner.

42:34.065 --> 42:36.226
May I have a look at the contract?

42:47.705 --> 42:51.398
What?... What a lovely throat.

42:53.274 --> 42:55.934
It's my wife, Lucy.

43:00.110 --> 43:01.098
Your hand.

43:03.211 --> 43:04.870
Your hand is so cold.

43:07.546 --> 43:10.412
The document... the contract for the
house, I must sign it immediately.

43:12.515 --> 43:14.640
Yes, but we haven't
settled on a price.

43:14.716 --> 43:16.445
It doesn't matter
between gentlemen...

43:16.517 --> 43:18.540
I accept whatever you find just.

43:33.858 --> 43:37.122
How long did it take you
to get here from Wismar?

43:37.560 --> 43:38.720
Four weeks.

43:44.462 --> 43:45.588
I...

43:49.531 --> 43:52.692
it takes a while to travel on land.

44:43.055 --> 44:46.648
From the seed of Belial
is the vampire born.

44:47.691 --> 44:50.989
He who feeds on the
blood of mankind...

44:51.626 --> 44:58.187
who, unredeemed, taketh his
refuge in caves, tombs...

44:58.362 --> 45:03.763
coffins filled with the
unblessed soil of cemeteries...

45:04.165 --> 45:07.291
wherein the black death
has reaped its harvest...

45:08.000 --> 45:09.693
the plague.

47:19.659 --> 47:21.319
Jonathan!

47:47.071 --> 47:49.469
She has a sudden fever.

47:52.073 --> 47:54.631
Her pulse is too fast.

47:56.408 --> 47:58.204
She needs to rest.

48:00.309 --> 48:03.744
Call me if you think
it is necessary...

48:04.344 --> 48:06.641
but I don't think it's
something serious.

50:54.854 --> 50:57.377
Oh, God, he must be
going to Wismar.

50:57.856 --> 50:59.048
Lucy...

51:00.222 --> 51:02.519
Lucy's in danger.

51:03.024 --> 51:04.719
I've got to get out of here.

53:08.881 --> 53:10.507
It's strange...

53:13.415 --> 53:15.814
but the papers are all in order.

53:16.251 --> 53:20.309
Let me see them...
From Varna to Wismar.

53:20.418 --> 53:23.214
Garden soil for
botanical experiments.

53:26.255 --> 53:27.619
Open one of them.

53:29.289 --> 53:30.982
I want to make sure.

53:31.322 --> 53:32.550
This one.

54:00.170 --> 54:05.070
Mother Superior...
stop the black coffins.

55:00.063 --> 55:02.655
The patient who came
yesterday had a seizure.

55:02.730 --> 55:03.628
Which one?

55:03.698 --> 55:04.890
The one who had bitten a cow.

55:04.964 --> 55:05.895
Oh, yes.

55:05.964 --> 55:07.023
We put him in isolation.

55:07.099 --> 55:08.429
I'll go with you.

55:11.668 --> 55:13.135
Blood is life.

55:17.871 --> 55:19.098
Blood is life.

55:19.171 --> 55:20.831
Has he done it for long?

55:20.905 --> 55:24.464
He has, and he also refuses food.

55:25.440 --> 55:26.669
Blood is life.

55:26.741 --> 55:28.207
Let's go.

55:30.876 --> 55:32.365
Help! Help me!

55:56.121 --> 55:57.109
Be quiet...

55:57.388 --> 55:59.378
I hear the sounds of sails
fluttering in the wind.

56:23.966 --> 56:25.365
Still, there's no letter from him.

56:26.602 --> 56:28.627
But, don't worry, Lucy...

56:29.370 --> 56:33.428
The mail from Transylvania
is very slow.

56:34.338 --> 56:36.737
Something has happened to Jonathan.

56:37.440 --> 56:40.895
Have courage, Lucy.
God is listening to our prayers.

56:42.774 --> 56:46.607
God is far away when we need him.

56:57.082 --> 56:59.776
Young man. You're not yet well.
You shouldn't travel.

56:59.849 --> 57:03.510
The black coffins... I must get
to Wismar before the coffins.

57:03.584 --> 57:06.779
You should at least wait for the doctor.
He'll be here tomorrow.

57:06.852 --> 57:11.082
Lucy, my wife, is in danger.
I must save her.

57:12.988 --> 57:14.852
The black coffins.

57:14.989 --> 57:16.785
Evil is on the way.

57:59.209 --> 58:05.166
I'm writing because I believe
there is a curse on my ship.

58:06.112 --> 58:11.843
One by one, four sailors and the
second mate have taken ill and died.

58:13.216 --> 58:16.877
Another sailor and our cook have
disappeared without a trace.

58:18.251 --> 58:24.482
A rumor of a mysterious stranger
on board scares everyone to death.

58:25.053 --> 58:31.387
We searched the boat and we
found nothing, except rats.

58:31.989 --> 58:35.014
We are maintaining our course.

58:35.091 --> 58:38.389
Northwest at 30 degrees.
The wind is steady. 12 knots.

59:00.070 --> 59:01.558
Mr. Renfield...

59:01.903 --> 59:06.838
you sent my husband
to Transylvania...

59:07.773 --> 59:10.434
and I haven't heard
from him in weeks.

59:10.640 --> 59:12.834
I'm very concerned...

59:14.309 --> 59:17.402
I want to go there
and look for him.

59:21.011 --> 59:24.070
Don't go yet. My master is coming.

59:24.746 --> 59:26.577
Who did you say is coming?

59:27.349 --> 59:29.339
The Lord of the Rats.

59:30.949 --> 59:35.281
He's bringing with him thousands
and thousands of rats.

59:38.153 --> 59:42.678
Orderly, give him some more food.
I think we should leave now.

01:00:03.064 --> 01:00:04.052
The plague.

01:03:47.731 --> 01:03:49.492
The Master has arrived.

01:04:00.203 --> 01:04:02.033
The Master has arrived.

01:04:32.117 --> 01:04:34.016
Lay a gangplank across.

01:04:34.084 --> 01:04:36.141
We need to search the ship.

01:05:01.063 --> 01:05:02.323
Cut him loose.

01:05:21.638 --> 01:05:25.503
There's not a soul on board.
Just some freight.

01:05:26.575 --> 01:05:29.565
But there are rats everywhere.

01:05:29.742 --> 01:05:32.368
Here's the ship's log.

01:06:20.931 --> 01:06:23.454
It's truly a mystery.

01:06:25.299 --> 01:06:30.667
I think, gentlemen, that the
ship's log may give us a clue.

01:06:33.837 --> 01:06:40.103
Varna, June 6. Myself, the Captain,
five hands, two mates and a cook...

01:06:40.440 --> 01:06:42.634
direction, the Dardanelles.

01:06:47.010 --> 01:06:48.636
Course westward.

01:06:48.978 --> 01:06:51.877
Today a third man
died of a high fever.

01:06:52.445 --> 01:06:57.711
Last night, while on his watch, a
mate disappeared without a trace.

01:06:58.148 --> 01:07:01.582
June 20th. Course northward
towards Biscaya.

01:07:01.650 --> 01:07:03.616
Speed 40 knots. Tall waves.

01:07:03.683 --> 01:07:06.082
Fear grows among my men.

01:07:06.352 --> 01:07:11.150
Now only the first mate
and I remain alive.

01:07:11.387 --> 01:07:15.082
There are rats everywhere.
Could it be a plague?

01:07:18.157 --> 01:07:21.057
Go home quietly, please.

01:07:21.626 --> 01:07:24.218
Shut the doors and
windows, gentlemen.

01:11:46.009 --> 01:11:48.499
Gracious lady, we brought this man.

01:11:49.044 --> 01:11:51.442
He says he lives here.

01:11:51.811 --> 01:11:52.902
Lucy!

01:11:55.079 --> 01:11:56.274
Jonathan!

01:12:09.520 --> 01:12:11.213
Who is this woman?

01:12:22.026 --> 01:12:23.652
Bring him in, please.

01:12:37.599 --> 01:12:43.296
It looks like he's suffering
from brain fever.

01:12:49.971 --> 01:12:52.131
The sun is hurting my eyes.

01:13:09.147 --> 01:13:14.103
Dr. Van Helsing. Do you
think we've all gone mad...

01:13:14.649 --> 01:13:18.549
and that one morning we'll all wake up
and find ourselves in straight-jackets?

01:15:44.982 --> 01:15:48.246
Excuse me for not knocking...

01:15:49.384 --> 01:15:51.544
I am Count Dracula.

01:15:53.219 --> 01:15:55.311
I know who you are.

01:15:56.053 --> 01:15:59.613
I read Jonathan's diary.

01:16:00.855 --> 01:16:04.221
He wrote everything that went on in
your castle, while he was there.

01:16:04.858 --> 01:16:08.418
- Don't worry, he won't die.
- Yes...

01:16:09.327 --> 01:16:11.658
he will. Death surrounds us.

01:16:12.794 --> 01:16:14.920
We're all at his will.

01:16:20.231 --> 01:16:23.720
The rivers continue
to flow without us.

01:16:25.433 --> 01:16:27.423
Time flies by.

01:16:28.802 --> 01:16:30.700
Even the stars...

01:16:31.403 --> 01:16:34.995
they wander towards us
in a very strange way.

01:16:36.472 --> 01:16:38.462
Only death is certain.

01:16:39.206 --> 01:16:41.196
Only death is cruel.

01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:45.930
Death is cruelty against
the unsuspecting.

01:16:46.476 --> 01:16:49.068
But that's not what I
perceive as cruel.

01:16:50.077 --> 01:16:53.842
Cruel is when you can't
die even if you want to.

01:16:54.547 --> 01:16:57.140
Give me some of your love...

01:16:57.215 --> 01:16:59.840
which you give Jonathan.

01:17:01.816 --> 01:17:03.476
I never will.

01:17:03.650 --> 01:17:07.415
I won't even give that love to God.

01:17:08.319 --> 01:17:10.683
If Jonathan can't have my love...

01:17:10.787 --> 01:17:12.549
then, no one else will.

01:17:12.987 --> 01:17:14.954
If I wish, he'll
recognize you again.

01:17:15.488 --> 01:17:18.820
But first, come and
give me your love.

01:17:19.291 --> 01:17:21.723
Only then, will I give
you your husband back.

01:17:22.292 --> 01:17:23.815
And as for me...

01:17:25.426 --> 01:17:28.417
the absence of love...

01:17:29.562 --> 01:17:33.257
is the most abject pain.

01:17:34.930 --> 01:17:38.126
The power of my love will
bring him back to me.

01:17:40.066 --> 01:17:42.191
And you may be assured...

01:17:43.369 --> 01:17:45.358
even the unthinkable
will not deter me...

01:17:45.469 --> 01:17:48.096
that you want to lay for me.

01:18:03.676 --> 01:18:05.165
Good night.

01:19:06.538 --> 01:19:07.526
Stop!

01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:14.735
Help! Help!

01:19:35.017 --> 01:19:38.110
Nosferatu, the undead.

01:19:38.619 --> 01:19:43.076
He drinks the blood of his victims, and
turns them into phantoms of the night.

01:19:44.288 --> 01:19:47.881
Like a shadow,
he has no reflection.

01:19:49.524 --> 01:19:52.719
He goes through walls
and closed doors...

01:19:53.025 --> 01:19:55.958
as if they never existed.

01:19:56.527 --> 01:20:00.256
Like a bat, he wafts
into dark bedrooms.

01:20:00.494 --> 01:20:05.724
Masquerading as a black wolf,
he hunts his fleeing victims.

01:20:06.097 --> 01:20:09.690
Abandon all hope, you
who cross his path.

01:20:20.738 --> 01:20:24.728
Yet even vampires, who are
considered unnatural creatures...

01:20:24.806 --> 01:20:28.763
are subject to some laws of nature.

01:20:29.375 --> 01:20:32.274
The sight of the cross bans him.

01:20:32.742 --> 01:20:35.437
The consecrated host...

01:20:35.509 --> 01:20:41.344
can bar his retreat.

01:20:42.181 --> 01:20:45.614
And if a pure hearted woman...

01:20:46.283 --> 01:20:48.943
diverts his attention from
the cry of the cock...

01:20:49.317 --> 01:20:53.217
the first light of day
will obliterate him.

01:21:14.195 --> 01:21:17.186
What is your wish, Master?

01:21:21.998 --> 01:21:23.487
Go north...

01:21:25.698 --> 01:21:27.166
to Riga.

01:21:28.635 --> 01:21:32.694
The army of rats and the
Black Death will follow you.

01:21:34.803 --> 01:21:36.930
Oh... Thy will be done.

01:21:37.006 --> 01:21:39.768
Amen...! Amen...!

01:22:21.892 --> 01:22:24.757
The plague! The plague!
What are you doing here?

01:22:24.893 --> 01:22:26.553
I must talk to the town council.

01:22:26.661 --> 01:22:29.128
It's been dissolved.
It doesn't exist anymore.

01:22:29.561 --> 01:22:30.822
Then, I must see the mayor.

01:22:30.895 --> 01:22:33.726
He's dead. Go back home,
as fast as you can.

01:22:34.797 --> 01:22:37.730
I know why this evil is happening!

01:22:38.565 --> 01:22:41.896
I know why this evil is happening!

01:22:42.733 --> 01:22:45.496
Why won't you listen to me?!

01:22:47.569 --> 01:22:49.729
I know the reason why.

01:23:08.913 --> 01:23:12.437
My child. It's all a figment
of your imagination.

01:23:12.914 --> 01:23:14.642
But Dr. Van Helsing...

01:23:15.448 --> 01:23:19.178
you've read Jonathan's diary.

01:23:19.750 --> 01:23:22.740
You've seen what has
happened to him.

01:23:23.351 --> 01:23:25.545
It's getting worse here every day.

01:23:25.686 --> 01:23:27.381
The plague. The rats.

01:23:30.588 --> 01:23:34.682
And this book about the vampires.

01:23:36.391 --> 01:23:38.415
This book explains it.

01:23:40.860 --> 01:23:42.951
This is an enlightened century.

01:23:43.027 --> 01:23:46.962
Science has refuted the
superstitions you're talking about.

01:23:47.596 --> 01:23:49.494
I know it exists.

01:23:49.596 --> 01:23:52.324
I believe what I see
with my own eyes.

01:23:52.731 --> 01:23:54.527
Faith... Faith...

01:23:55.032 --> 01:23:57.091
Yes, faith.

01:23:57.467 --> 01:23:59.593
Yes, faith, Dr. Van Helsing.

01:23:59.970 --> 01:24:00.993
Faith.

01:24:02.070 --> 01:24:05.162
Faith is the faculty in men...

01:24:05.237 --> 01:24:08.432
which enables us to
believe things...

01:24:08.505 --> 01:24:10.938
we know to be untrue.

01:24:14.108 --> 01:24:17.439
You must come and help
me destroy this monster.

01:24:18.343 --> 01:24:20.435
We must look for him.

01:24:21.444 --> 01:24:23.810
Coffins have come by
boat from the Black Sea.

01:24:24.146 --> 01:24:27.137
We can search for them
tonight, and destroy them.

01:24:27.381 --> 01:24:32.008
My child, you need some rest.

01:24:32.717 --> 01:24:35.410
<i>Your husband's condition
has worn you out.</i>

01:24:35.683 --> 01:24:37.548
No, Dr. Van Helsing. Tonight.

01:24:37.618 --> 01:24:41.676
I need to study this
matter scientifically.

01:24:41.753 --> 01:24:46.916
No! Tonight! There's
no time to lose.

01:24:47.422 --> 01:24:51.516
Even a farmer knows that there's a
time to plant and a time to sow.

01:24:51.624 --> 01:24:56.389
He doesn't dig up the wheat
to check if it is growing.

01:24:56.461 --> 01:25:01.122
Only children playing farmers
would do such things.

01:25:06.965 --> 01:25:11.364
I guess I'll have to do this alone!

01:25:18.004 --> 01:25:19.766
Well, then.

01:25:51.852 --> 01:25:54.648
Mother Superior, my medicine.

01:26:06.492 --> 01:26:09.891
My lady, how exactly did we meet?

01:32:46.904 --> 01:32:47.892
Join us, please.

01:32:47.971 --> 01:32:50.631
Would you like a drink?
Be our guest.

01:32:51.171 --> 01:32:55.332
We've all contracted the plague. Let's
enjoy whatever time we have to live.

01:33:15.481 --> 01:33:18.881
Madam Lucy! Madam Lucy! Open up!

01:33:21.951 --> 01:33:25.076
Come quickly to the Schraders...

01:33:25.585 --> 01:33:27.553
Something terrible
has happened there.

01:33:56.333 --> 01:33:59.529
Lucy, calm down.

01:33:59.636 --> 01:34:02.967
You can come closer.
It is not the plague.

01:34:05.604 --> 01:34:09.197
My God! What happened?

01:34:09.506 --> 01:34:11.062
I don't know exactly.

01:34:11.139 --> 01:34:14.629
She was already dead,
when I arrived.

01:34:16.109 --> 01:34:20.566
He lost his sanity over
it, he started to rave.

01:34:23.512 --> 01:34:27.913
We shall study this
matter scientifically...

01:34:27.981 --> 01:34:31.779
without prejudice, and
without superstition.

01:34:34.918 --> 01:34:39.215
Enough! Enough. Stop acting
like you know everything.

01:34:40.519 --> 01:34:44.213
I know, now, what I've got to do.

01:35:14.802 --> 01:35:18.793
The consecrated host
bans the vampire.

01:35:41.380 --> 01:35:46.839
And if a pure hearted woman, diverts his
attention from the cry of the cock...

01:35:47.850 --> 01:35:51.214
the first light of day
will obliterate him.

01:42:19.857 --> 01:42:23.553
Too late. Oh, God...

01:42:23.625 --> 01:42:26.855
if I had only listened to her.

01:42:36.664 --> 01:42:40.154
A stake and a hammer.

01:42:41.032 --> 01:42:44.398
I have to dispatch
this demon forever.

01:42:58.807 --> 01:43:02.241
Stop. Don't do it!

01:43:33.490 --> 01:43:34.513
Van Helsing!

01:43:35.458 --> 01:43:37.118
Get him! Yes, him!

01:43:37.591 --> 01:43:39.558
That man has murdered the Count!

01:43:41.460 --> 01:43:42.983
Have you done that?

01:43:45.929 --> 01:43:47.327
With that stake?

01:43:47.562 --> 01:43:51.394
Yes... But I had a good
reason for doing it.

01:43:51.464 --> 01:43:52.987
That's for the courts to decide.

01:43:53.265 --> 01:43:55.926
You're under arrest,
Dr. Van Helsing.

01:43:56.766 --> 01:43:57.960
Arrest this man.

01:43:59.068 --> 01:44:00.227
Arrest him?

01:44:00.402 --> 01:44:03.130
- I can't arrest him.
- Then get the police.

01:44:03.203 --> 01:44:04.965
The police don't exist anymore.

01:44:05.237 --> 01:44:07.329
Then take him to prison.

01:44:07.438 --> 01:44:09.768
There's no one there to guard him.

01:44:09.839 --> 01:44:11.829
It's your duty as a town
employee to handle it.

01:44:11.907 --> 01:44:13.964
I don't have a weapon.

01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:16.837
I don't care! I want you
to arrest this man!

01:44:17.742 --> 01:44:20.301
Where will you take me, then?

01:44:24.379 --> 01:44:26.142
I don't know where I'm taking you.

01:44:26.214 --> 01:44:29.544
Take me wherever you want.

01:44:32.016 --> 01:44:33.845
Don't just stand there.

01:44:34.950 --> 01:44:39.907
Get a broom. It's all dusty.

01:45:03.896 --> 01:45:07.456
Seal the room for an
official investigation.

01:45:08.299 --> 01:45:11.629
And bring me my horse.

01:45:11.966 --> 01:45:16.526
I have much to do. Now!
