WEBVTT

02:30.442 --> 02:32.778
Five, four, three…

03:13.527 --> 03:15.070
Hey, hey! Cory Ellison.

03:15.153 --> 03:17.865
Hey, you got any thoughts
on the Maggie Brener's excerpt?

03:17.948 --> 03:20.450
Mitch Kessler displayed
a troubling pattern of behavior

03:20.534 --> 03:22.327
that led to his firing almost a year ago.

03:22.411 --> 03:25.205
And a lot has changed in a year.
Uh, new TMS.

03:25.289 --> 03:28.292
Okay. Hey, do you think
Mitch Kessler has a thing for the sisters?

03:29.042 --> 03:30.043
Really can't say.

03:30.127 --> 03:32.004
Okay. Well, what about Bradley?

03:32.087 --> 03:34.214
You think Bradley Jackson has
a thing for the ladies?

03:34.298 --> 03:35.299
-Morning.
-Morning, sir.

03:39.136 --> 03:41.346
-Morning.
-Morning. You're in early.

03:41.930 --> 03:45.809
UBA+ is worldwide, Stella.
There's no such thing as early or late.

03:45.893 --> 03:48.979
I got a, uh, call with Shanghai Studios
about licensing.

03:50.147 --> 03:53.275
You're awfully upbeat
given the ungodly hour and the bad press.

03:53.358 --> 03:55.611
Stella, I wanna talk about
something you said to me yesterday

03:55.694 --> 03:56.695
that really bothered me.

03:56.778 --> 03:57.905
What did I say?

03:57.988 --> 04:00.324
You asked me if I was okay.

04:02.117 --> 04:04.328
It doesn't matter if I'm okay.

04:05.078 --> 04:07.581
This is the 200-meter freestyle.

04:07.664 --> 04:11.210
Absorbing other people's feelings,
that's a two-ton anchor around your neck.

04:11.293 --> 04:14.546
Go ahead. Care about the world, tithe,
fall in love. Whatever. On your own time.

04:14.630 --> 04:17.132
Here, feelings, they drain your lifeblood.

04:17.216 --> 04:19.259
They, um, turn your eyes gray.

04:19.343 --> 04:23.722
How I'm doing cannot be your problem.
Caring about other people,

04:23.805 --> 04:26.934
it limits your ability
to make self-serving decisions.

04:27.017 --> 04:29.811
And what is good for you is
good for the company.

04:29.895 --> 04:31.355
-Yeah.
-'Cause it owns you.

04:31.438 --> 04:34.066
And it owns me. And we own it.
And we are all one.

04:34.733 --> 04:36.944
-Circle of life.
-Let the circle be unbroken.

04:38.487 --> 04:40.405
Exactly.

04:40.489 --> 04:43.700
Fucking exactly. Yes. Yes!

04:43.784 --> 04:46.245
Come by my office
with Gerald and Linda after my call.

04:46.328 --> 04:49.498
We need to strategize about how to make
these TMS bombshells work for us.

04:49.581 --> 04:50.791
-Got it.
-Good.

04:55.337 --> 04:56.380
Awesome!

04:57.840 --> 04:59.049
-Chip.
-Cory.

04:59.967 --> 05:02.636
Good call on Laura.
Ratings were great yesterday.

05:02.719 --> 05:04.555
Yeah, it really spiked
when the Vault piece hit.

05:04.638 --> 05:06.348
-Yeah. Crazy timing.
-Yeah.

05:06.431 --> 05:08.767
Just, uh, tell Alex to get her rest.

05:08.851 --> 05:09.852
-Yeah, I will.
-Okay.

05:09.935 --> 05:12.020
About to talk to her right now.

05:30.372 --> 05:31.999
Your call has been forwarded

05:32.082 --> 05:34.001
to an automatic voice messaging system.

05:34.084 --> 05:35.127
Alex Levy…

05:35.210 --> 05:38.380
…is not available.
Please leave a message after the tone.

05:50.767 --> 05:52.603
What the fuck are you doing?

05:52.686 --> 05:56.356
You dumb fucking asshole!

05:56.440 --> 05:59.902
I thought you wanted me here
because you care.

05:59.985 --> 06:02.404
Not just to assuage your guilt.

06:02.487 --> 06:04.489
I mean, they wanted you, I can only guess,

06:04.573 --> 06:06.825
because they were
under the mistaken impression

06:06.909 --> 06:10.787
that they hadn't wrung
every little juicy ounce of humanity

06:10.871 --> 06:14.458
out of your dry fucking soul
the first time around.

06:14.541 --> 06:16.251
And that maybe there was
some money to be made.

06:16.335 --> 06:18.462
But no, no. You're such an idiot.

06:18.545 --> 06:22.049
They were gonna shitcan you,
and you come fucking running back to them.

06:22.132 --> 06:27.471
Because you are
incapable of loving a human being.

06:27.554 --> 06:33.227
So, now, now,
you turn to the rapidly dwindling

06:33.310 --> 06:34.978
faceless masses,

06:35.062 --> 06:38.607
who only think they love you
because they don't know the real you.

06:39.274 --> 06:42.778
The real you is an emotional murderer.

06:42.861 --> 06:46.031
Took this fucking shiv
and shoved it in my ass

06:46.114 --> 06:48.951
and fucking ran it all around.

06:49.034 --> 06:52.746
The real fucking you only showed up
on my doorstep, begging me to come back,

06:52.829 --> 06:55.290
because Bradley Jackson wouldn't let
you forget that

06:55.374 --> 06:58.252
you fucking ratfucked me
just to save yourself.

06:58.335 --> 07:00.754
Well, guess what? It's not like
the old days, is it, anymore?

07:00.838 --> 07:02.214
No, it's not! You know why?

07:03.006 --> 07:07.344
I don't have any self-esteem left
for you to suck on,

07:07.427 --> 07:10.514
you parasite and a succubus
with my esteem!

07:11.056 --> 07:13.600
But still, I'm here, Alex.

07:15.185 --> 07:17.354
And where the fuck are you?

07:18.856 --> 07:19.857
…during our mornings.

07:19.940 --> 07:21.900
You think
she might actually not show up?

07:21.984 --> 07:24.278
Let's hope not.
We're selling her pretty hard.

07:24.361 --> 07:25.946
But I wouldn't blame her.

07:26.029 --> 07:27.990
You left out the apostrophe in "it's."

07:28.073 --> 07:30.534
Whatever. I just wanted
eyes on it before I show her.

07:30.993 --> 07:32.494
Doesn't take a genius to figure out

07:32.578 --> 07:36.164
who the African American producer was
that Maggie was writing about.

07:40.377 --> 07:43.338
Hey, Mia.
Would you wanna take a look at this?

07:43.422 --> 07:45.465
It's the copy
for the story about the excerpt.

07:48.886 --> 07:50.512
Are we being evenhanded?

07:50.596 --> 07:51.638
We are.

07:53.223 --> 07:54.224
Then no.

07:55.309 --> 07:56.435
I trust you.

08:00.522 --> 08:02.900
Thanks, Kiana.
Today on The Morning Show,

08:02.983 --> 08:05.402
we have Dr. Henry Lewis Gates Junior,

08:05.485 --> 08:08.655
ambush makeovers,
and effective eight-minute workouts.

08:08.739 --> 08:12.034
And she's great at night,
but we missed her during our mornings.

08:12.117 --> 08:14.036
Laura Peterson will be sitting in.

08:14.119 --> 08:18.373
So stay tuned after the early news
on UBA 6, WGZQ,

08:18.457 --> 08:20.209
Orlando's number one source for news.

08:20.292 --> 08:23.003
That's right.
Now back to you, Joe and Kiana.

08:23.086 --> 08:25.464
We're clear. Thirty minutes to showtime.

08:26.798 --> 08:29.009
Gordon. Gordon!

08:30.636 --> 08:33.639
Is she here yet? Because I just wanna talk
to her before the show starts.

08:33.722 --> 08:36.558
Well, soon, but I'll, uh,
let Laura know to, you know, stop by.

08:36.642 --> 08:37.976
Okay, thanks!

08:41.897 --> 08:44.525
RJ, um,
can I talk to you for just a second?

08:44.608 --> 08:49.196
Can you book a flight for my brother
from here to Yeager Airport in Charleston

08:49.279 --> 08:51.240
and just get a car
to pick him up from my place?

08:51.323 --> 08:52.783
I didn't know he was in town.

08:53.242 --> 08:56.161
-Yeah, um… Yeah.
-Are we gonna get to, um…

08:56.245 --> 08:58.789
No. I just need some time
before the show starts. Can you handle it?

08:58.872 --> 08:59.873
-Yeah.
-Thanks.

09:09.383 --> 09:11.009
-Hello?
-Just getting off the elevator.

09:11.093 --> 09:12.803
Should I come to your dressing room?

09:12.886 --> 09:14.972
No, you were right yesterday.
Best not to push it.

09:15.055 --> 09:16.515
-Bradley?
-Okay.

09:16.598 --> 09:18.225
I just wanna see you before the show.

09:19.935 --> 09:21.395
Okay.

09:21.478 --> 09:23.313
I'm in my dressing room now. What's up?

09:23.397 --> 09:27.985
First of all, again.
I… I just wanna say I'm sorry.

09:28.610 --> 09:29.736
I appreciate that.

09:29.820 --> 09:33.824
And-- And last night
I told my brother he had to leave.

09:33.907 --> 09:36.702
And I sent him back home.
I'm really putting up boundaries.

09:36.785 --> 09:38.704
Bradley, I didn't ask you to do that.

09:38.787 --> 09:42.040
And what we talked about last night.
There's no simple fix for this.

09:42.124 --> 09:43.125
What? For what?

09:43.208 --> 09:47.421
This is a lot to take on
right before I go do a show.

09:47.504 --> 09:49.256
And I need my head in the right place.

09:49.339 --> 09:51.884
Well, now this has put
my head in a wrong place.

09:51.967 --> 09:52.968
-Wha--
-Bradley.

09:53.051 --> 09:54.803
I need to let in hair and makeup.

09:54.887 --> 09:56.805
And there is not enough makeup
in the world

09:56.889 --> 09:58.891
to make me look like I'm enjoying this.

09:59.850 --> 10:00.851
Okay.

10:02.519 --> 10:03.520
Whatever.

10:12.321 --> 10:14.907
Okay, seven seconds! Good show, everybody.

10:14.990 --> 10:17.284
Five, four, three…

10:20.996 --> 10:22.414
-Good show.
-Good show.

10:25.792 --> 10:29.880
There are now
60 reported cases of the novel coronavirus

10:29.963 --> 10:32.633
here in the US across multiple states.

10:33.967 --> 10:37.971
The CDC has warned that
a full outbreak is inevitable here

10:38.055 --> 10:40.766
and that people should brace
for interruptions to their daily lives.

10:40.849 --> 10:42.392
-Thanks. Hey.
-Hey.

10:42.476 --> 10:44.144
All businesses have been warned they…

10:44.228 --> 10:45.062
Thanks.

10:45.896 --> 10:47.814
Sorry to take back your set.
Here. Come here.

10:49.024 --> 10:51.235
Don't read anything into it. It's not--

10:51.318 --> 10:54.154
Whatever you say.
You're gonna owe me, you know?

10:55.447 --> 10:57.157
So, any sign of her?

10:57.241 --> 10:59.743
No, she just fucking vanished
into thin air.

11:01.119 --> 11:05.207
She probably needed, like, private space.

11:05.290 --> 11:08.919
Well, maybe she shouldn't be
on TV five days a week.

11:09.002 --> 11:13.465
Kind of a bad career choice for,
you know, private space area.

11:13.549 --> 11:14.883
She's gonna show up somewhere.

11:14.967 --> 11:17.845
-…more on Italy and South Korea.
-Yeah, a fucking morgue.

11:17.928 --> 11:20.681
Don't-- Don't joke like that.
It's not funny.

11:21.640 --> 11:25.227
Why? It's not like it's gonna happen,
and even if it does…

11:25.769 --> 11:27.312
Whatever. She had a good run.

11:31.400 --> 11:33.068
I miss Elmira Chip.

11:33.986 --> 11:37.531
Elmira Chip's dead.
He's in a morgue with Alex.

11:39.116 --> 11:40.200
She'll show up.

11:40.284 --> 11:42.703
Our hearts go out
to everyone affected in Italy…

11:48.083 --> 11:49.084
Thank you.

11:53.213 --> 11:55.549
Do you need anything
before I drive back today?

11:59.469 --> 12:01.346
I don't know. Maybe.

12:02.681 --> 12:03.765
Maybe.

12:06.310 --> 12:07.686
I'm all yours this weekend.

12:07.769 --> 12:09.188
Really?

12:09.271 --> 12:11.315
Why do we have to wait for the weekend?
There's nobody here.

12:11.398 --> 12:13.817
We'll close those blinds.
We can do it right here.

12:15.402 --> 12:17.696
Fuck Alex. We'll do it in her office.
Come on.

12:17.779 --> 12:19.781
We'll show her.

12:22.784 --> 12:24.786
-I don't--
-What?

12:24.870 --> 12:26.413
-It's just, um--
-What? What?

12:26.496 --> 12:27.873
It's a little creepy.

12:27.956 --> 12:29.791
Creepy? What? That-- I did--

12:30.334 --> 12:33.086
That's something you're bringing to it.
I didn't-- I wasn't being creepy.

12:33.170 --> 12:34.338
That's a-- I brought that?

12:35.005 --> 12:38.675
I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry, I just--

12:42.095 --> 12:44.348
Look, when this all dies down,
it's gonna be normal again, okay?

12:44.431 --> 12:46.183
-I promise you.
-When this all dies down?

12:46.266 --> 12:48.852
Like, Chip,
you were just in here watching TV.

12:48.936 --> 12:52.147
I'm sorry. Jesus! I'm sorry. Fuck!

12:54.858 --> 12:56.944
Yeah, I'm just-- I'm gonna go.

12:57.027 --> 13:00.239
No, no, no. Let me walk you out.
I'm gonna walk you out. Okay? It's fine.

13:01.114 --> 13:02.991
I'd rather you didn't.

13:12.584 --> 13:14.962
-There's no such thing as bad press.
-Did you read the excerpt?

13:15.045 --> 13:17.339
Yeah, sure, I read it.
On a human level? Yeah, horrible.

13:17.422 --> 13:19.758
But as far as we're concerned,
I didn't see anything bad in it.

13:19.842 --> 13:22.845
They're all gone. Fred's a ghost.
Mitch is as good as dead.

13:22.928 --> 13:24.847
We're-- We're the heroes here.

13:24.930 --> 13:27.850
Stella and I, we're the, uh,
Arthur and Lancelot of UBA News.

13:27.933 --> 13:30.143
Gerald, you get to be Merlin. Linda--

13:30.227 --> 13:32.145
Okay. Phone calls.

13:32.229 --> 13:34.231
Sorry. I'll put that away.

13:34.314 --> 13:37.359
Mia's still in here.
It's not her fault, but the book.

13:37.442 --> 13:39.236
-Twist.
-It's not a great look for her.

13:39.319 --> 13:41.238
She's overcoming. She's rising above it.

13:41.321 --> 13:44.950
This is another success story.
A strong, powerful woman.

13:45.033 --> 13:47.578
Yeah. I mean,
we did hire Alex and Chip back.

13:47.661 --> 13:48.996
Hey, sorry, Gerald.

13:49.079 --> 13:51.290
Your assistant's on line 2.
Says it's urgent.

13:51.373 --> 13:52.833
New assistant.

13:52.916 --> 13:54.293
Everything's a crisis.

13:54.376 --> 13:57.713
I mean, there is no way Alex and Chip
come out of this book looking good.

13:57.796 --> 13:59.590
But they're no Mitch and Fred.

13:59.673 --> 14:01.800
There are two shots at redemption.

14:01.884 --> 14:04.386
-Everybody loves a redemption story…
-Hi, Sonya. What's going on?

14:04.469 --> 14:07.556
…and you know why. Because everybody's
done shit, and they all wanna be redeemed.

14:07.639 --> 14:09.474
Okay, what about those two?

14:10.267 --> 14:11.935
Bradley's appeal is Middle America.

14:12.019 --> 14:15.856
Well, if there were ever two lesbians
who could appeal to Middle America

14:15.939 --> 14:18.775
-it's those two lesbians-- allegedly.
-Hold a moment. Just hold a moment.

14:18.859 --> 14:19.735
Okay.

14:20.569 --> 14:24.156
I don't know, um, what this is,
but you should hear it.

14:25.782 --> 14:27.242
Okay. I'm sorry. We, uh--

14:27.326 --> 14:29.703
Having some connection issues,
but I have changed phones.

14:29.786 --> 14:31.079
Can you repeat the question?

14:31.663 --> 14:34.583
Okay, yes. I am Luca Romano.
I am a reporter.

14:34.666 --> 14:38.253
I work for Il Gazzettino newspaper
in Mestre, Italy.

14:38.337 --> 14:39.922
And...

14:40.005 --> 14:43.550
I calling for comment
on the death of Mitch Kessler.

14:45.552 --> 14:46.970
Okay, I think I understand.

14:47.054 --> 14:52.017
Have you been able to, um, verify this,
that Mitch Kessler has died?

14:52.100 --> 14:55.646
No, I am asking you for comment.
I do not need verification.

14:55.729 --> 14:57.981
No. Do you have verification?

15:01.485 --> 15:05.030
Have you been able to confirm
this is true?

15:06.823 --> 15:08.784
We have been told
he was in a car accident near Riva.

15:08.867 --> 15:10.202
Is that near Lake Como?

15:10.285 --> 15:12.579
I think that's where he was
when that girl was yelling at him.

15:12.663 --> 15:13.664
Do you have a comment?

15:13.747 --> 15:15.332
The network has no comment…

15:15.415 --> 15:17.334
-Go!
-…until the facts can be verified.

15:17.417 --> 15:18.669
But thank you.

15:19.962 --> 15:21.380
And Stella!

15:21.463 --> 15:24.424
I don't care if she's in traction,
get Alex in here!

15:24.508 --> 15:26.176
And that's your latest weather.

15:26.260 --> 15:29.054
That warmer weather's gonna be here
before you know it.

15:29.137 --> 15:30.597
I'm gonna miss winter clothes.

15:30.681 --> 15:32.766
Is that just me?
Preferring winter clothes?

15:32.850 --> 15:35.269
When you look like I do,
you hate to hide the sexy.

15:35.352 --> 15:37.145
That is not an answer.

15:37.229 --> 15:38.480
Bradley, what about you?

15:40.107 --> 15:42.860
Still to come,
Prince Harry's first trip to the UK

15:42.943 --> 15:45.612
since announcing
he was quitting as a senior royal.

15:45.696 --> 15:49.867
Plus an upcoming book about this show
reveals new allegations.

15:49.950 --> 15:53.745
Did former anchor Mitch Kessler target
women of color?

15:55.080 --> 15:56.456
When TMS returns.

15:58.792 --> 16:01.628
We have an unconfirmed report
that Mitch Kessler is dead.

16:04.298 --> 16:05.632
What did you hear?

16:05.716 --> 16:08.719
An obscure Italian paper called
for comment. Said it was a car accident.

16:08.802 --> 16:11.180
That's all we have.
Cory wants Alex to report it.

16:17.853 --> 16:21.231
Gayle, Gordon, Joel, Layla,
come here now, please.

16:26.570 --> 16:28.197
Some Italian newspaper called

16:28.280 --> 16:31.325
with the news that,
Mitch Kessler has died.

16:31.408 --> 16:33.035
Outside Riva. Near Lake Como.

16:33.118 --> 16:35.037
Joel and Layla, find out anything you can.

16:35.120 --> 16:36.997
This guy is ours, for better or for worse.

16:37.080 --> 16:39.374
So if it's true or if it's
just somebody's wishful thinking,

16:39.458 --> 16:41.502
we are gonna be
the first ones to report it.

16:41.585 --> 16:44.630
It's gonna travel fast,
but I've gotta have two confirmations,

16:44.713 --> 16:48.091
and we will not report it
until his family knows. Okay?

16:48.592 --> 16:50.844
-Gayle and Gordon, are you good to help?
-Yeah.

16:50.928 --> 16:53.555
Yes. But Chip does know
the show backwards and forwards.

16:53.639 --> 16:56.350
Well, he's gonna be busy.
Thank you so much. Thank you. Go. Go.

16:56.433 --> 16:59.394
-Mia, seriously. You've got this.
-Mia, are you okay?

16:59.478 --> 17:03.357
Yeah. But pull the story on the excerpt
until we know for sure.

17:03.440 --> 17:04.525
Okay.

17:12.406 --> 17:13.951
-Hey.
-Hey. I need to talk to you.

17:14.034 --> 17:14.910
So, I wanted--

17:14.992 --> 17:16.994
Before you start,
I really just wanna say something.

17:17.079 --> 17:19.830
I know that as a straight white guy
I can't possibly--

17:19.915 --> 17:22.084
My God. Shut up. I don't care.
I need to tell you--

17:22.166 --> 17:24.670
-That excerpt I know was difficult--
-Chip, I want you-- Shut up.

17:26.672 --> 17:27.881
Mitch might be dead.

17:30.592 --> 17:33.595
Shit! Oh. Oh, sh-- Okay, what do you need?

17:33.679 --> 17:35.722
What I need most is
for you to get Alex in here.

17:35.806 --> 17:36.807
I can handle the rest.

17:36.890 --> 17:39.518
This might be fake news,
but the network wants her on standby.

17:39.601 --> 17:42.145
So I gotta have Alex Levy
in here right now.

17:43.105 --> 17:45.107
-Yeah.
-Okay. Let's go. Let's go.

17:58.245 --> 18:01.415
Card services.
How can I direct your call?

18:01.498 --> 18:02.791
Representative.

18:04.418 --> 18:05.752
Representative.

18:08.130 --> 18:10.465
Thank you for calling card services.
This is Shane.

18:10.549 --> 18:11.884
Could I get the 15-digit number

18:11.967 --> 18:13.719
associated with the account
you're calling about?

18:13.802 --> 18:15.804
Hey, Shane. I don't have
my account number on me right now.

18:15.888 --> 18:18.599
-Could I give you my social instead?
-Not a problem. What's the social?

18:18.682 --> 18:22.102
Excellent. 740-00-5924.

18:22.186 --> 18:25.022
Great. I'll need you to answer
a few security questions.

18:25.105 --> 18:26.106
You got it.

18:26.190 --> 18:27.816
What is the name
of your childhood best friend?

18:27.900 --> 18:28.901
Colleen.

18:28.984 --> 18:30.944
And what was your mother's maiden name?

18:31.028 --> 18:32.154
Lasine.

18:32.237 --> 18:34.281
And what is the year,
make and model of your first car?

18:34.364 --> 18:37.618
Give me a tough one, huh?
1976 Plymouth Duster.

18:38.243 --> 18:41.371
For security purposes, what's the name
associated with the account?

18:41.455 --> 18:42.998
It's my name, Alex Levy.

18:43.081 --> 18:44.708
Great. How can I help you today?

18:45.959 --> 18:48.712
Well, I'm, uh, trying to make a charge,
and it's not going through.

18:48.795 --> 18:50.547
So I was hoping you could help me out.

18:51.048 --> 18:53.675
I'm so sorry.
Give me a moment to check into it.

18:57.137 --> 18:58.847
I don't see any attempted charges.

18:59.765 --> 19:02.434
That's-- Are you sure?
That's-- That's-- That's strange.

19:02.518 --> 19:05.103
Do you, uh…
What's the last one you have there?

19:05.187 --> 19:07.940
The most recent charge I see went through.

19:08.023 --> 19:12.027
It looks like two days ago
at Milan Linate Airport.

19:18.325 --> 19:21.161
You know, I'll just pay cash. Thanks.

19:22.663 --> 19:23.914
…and I happen to work for UBA.

19:23.997 --> 19:26.333
I'm sorry you had
a bad experience with him,

19:26.416 --> 19:29.878
but you need to make this a priority
until we know for sure. Grazie.

19:30.879 --> 19:32.798
-Where are you?
-On hold again. Anything with John?

19:32.881 --> 19:34.925
-Oh, my God.
-What? What? What do you have?

19:35.008 --> 19:36.635
Some guy just posted this picture.

19:37.219 --> 19:38.679
It says, "Michael Kessler." It's not--

19:38.762 --> 19:41.265
No. But the other details line up.
This guy's in Riva.

19:41.348 --> 19:44.184
Even if this is him, this doesn't look
that bad. He could survive this.

19:44.268 --> 19:46.436
I can see the license plate.
I'll check the registration.

19:46.520 --> 19:47.980
Hello? Yes.

19:48.063 --> 19:50.274
-English. English, please.
-Mia Jordan.

19:50.357 --> 19:53.902
Who knows if it helps or hurts the book?
I mean, it's even money.

19:53.986 --> 19:57.155
People might not have
the stomach to pile on a dead guy.

19:57.239 --> 19:59.950
This is Mitch Kessler, Gerald.

20:00.033 --> 20:02.202
We need to prepare for a feeding frenzy.
This is gonna be

20:02.286 --> 20:05.122
everyone's last good chance
to pull every scrap of meat from the bone.

20:05.205 --> 20:07.291
-Where are we with Alex?
-We're getting her.

20:11.461 --> 20:15.132
What makes you so sure that
Alex reporting this is the best decision?

20:17.467 --> 20:18.886
You mean, is it the best decision

20:18.969 --> 20:24.099
for the on-screen ex-wife of the disgraced
predator-turned-dead-disgraced-predator

20:24.183 --> 20:26.894
to report his sudden,
untimely death to the world?

20:27.436 --> 20:29.188
I find that compelling.

20:33.275 --> 20:34.651
It begins.

20:34.735 --> 20:36.778
He knows. It's ours.

20:37.654 --> 20:40.282
Wendell, hi. How are you?

20:40.365 --> 20:42.659
I can't complain. You've heard the rumors?

20:42.743 --> 20:44.411
I have. How can I help you?

20:44.494 --> 20:46.788
You're new to the business,
but TV news is a family.

20:46.872 --> 20:50.209
Dysfunctional sometimes, but that's
what makes things exciting, you know?

20:50.292 --> 20:53.003
And I know there's a lot made of
the so-called "morning wars",

20:53.086 --> 20:55.464
but, well, some things transcend all that.

20:56.048 --> 20:58.800
The loss of human life,
especially for families with kids,

20:58.884 --> 21:00.135
it's just so tragic.

21:00.219 --> 21:03.222
If it is true, and I pray to God it isn't,

21:03.305 --> 21:05.682
I just wanted to say that
this is TMS's story.

21:06.725 --> 21:08.852
We haven't been able to reach
anyone out there to confirm,

21:08.936 --> 21:12.648
but we did hear he was taken
to Hospital Sant'Angelo outside Como.

21:12.731 --> 21:14.566
You probably have that already, but…

21:15.192 --> 21:16.527
Yeah. We appreciate it, Wendell.

21:16.610 --> 21:18.237
It's madness here,
but thank you for calling.

21:18.320 --> 21:20.989
It means a lot to me, it means
a lot to us. I'll talk to you soon.

21:22.032 --> 21:25.369
I gotta call this information downstairs.
We need to make a plan to harness this.

21:25.452 --> 21:27.371
That motherfucker won't have died in vain.

21:28.455 --> 21:31.083
Oh, my God. Stella, I got it. Thank you.

21:31.166 --> 21:33.710
Okay. This is the hospital
where Mitch was supposedly taken.

21:33.794 --> 21:34.920
See what you can find out.

21:35.003 --> 21:37.673
Registered to a Clay Becker.
Do you have any contact info for him?

21:37.756 --> 21:39.174
Clay Becker owns KVPQ.

21:39.258 --> 21:40.884
-He's a UBA affiliate owner.
-What?

21:42.427 --> 21:44.137
Oh, fuck.

21:45.889 --> 21:47.599
This is Clay Becker's contact info.

21:47.683 --> 21:48.725
See if you can reach him.

21:48.809 --> 21:50.394
Joel, the hospital.

21:50.477 --> 21:51.478
I'll be back.

21:52.980 --> 21:55.023
-Hey, Joel.
-Hey. Did you get ahold of Alex?

21:55.107 --> 21:56.400
Yeah, it's just taking a second.

21:56.483 --> 21:59.570
You know, this is hitting her pretty hard.
Did you find anything out?

21:59.653 --> 22:02.072
You know, if this isn't real,
I'd like to put her at ease.

22:02.155 --> 22:03.448
No, nothing from the consulate.

22:03.532 --> 22:06.118
Nobody's reporting anything officially
or even unofficially.

22:06.201 --> 22:09.079
I mean, I saw a couple tweets
and a photo of an accident.

22:09.162 --> 22:11.582
The car is registered to a Clay Becker?

22:11.665 --> 22:13.000
UBA San Francisco Clay Becker?

22:13.083 --> 22:15.419
Yeah, apparently.
I'm just calling the hospital right now.

22:15.502 --> 22:16.420
Wait. A hospital?

22:16.503 --> 22:18.005
Yeah. We got a tip from NBN

22:18.088 --> 22:19.882
that Mitch was taken to
a hospital outside Como.

22:19.965 --> 22:22.176
I need you to get me the name
of the hospital. I wanna call them.

22:22.259 --> 22:25.470
I'm trying to get ahold of them right now.
The phone's ringing as we speak.

22:25.554 --> 22:27.556
Joel, just give me
the name of the fucking hospital!

22:27.639 --> 22:30.100
Jesus. Fine. It's...

22:30.184 --> 22:32.728
"Ospedale Sant'Angelo." It's in the a--

22:32.811 --> 22:33.854
I got it.

22:35.105 --> 22:36.773
Oh, my God.

22:36.857 --> 22:39.943
Mia. You should look at this.

22:40.777 --> 22:42.613
Yeah, yeah. I saw it.

22:42.696 --> 22:45.741
I'm gonna talk to everybody
in the break. Thank you.

22:46.658 --> 22:48.493
Stand by, four. Take four.

22:50.412 --> 22:52.039
Stand by, three. Take three.

22:52.122 --> 22:56.502
Daniel, you sat down with a very
inspiring family that defied the odds.

22:56.585 --> 22:59.379
Yes,
and it's a very special story.

22:59.463 --> 23:01.048
I can't wait for you to see it.

23:01.131 --> 23:04.218
Plus, a new inhaler
just approved by the FDA

23:04.301 --> 23:07.513
could save asthma sufferers money
while it saves their lives.

23:07.596 --> 23:08.680
When we return.

23:10.307 --> 23:11.725
We're clear. Back in four.

23:12.768 --> 23:13.852
Step in?

23:13.936 --> 23:15.979
Thank you. Good morning, good morning.

23:16.063 --> 23:17.856
-Morning, good morning.
-Morning.

23:17.940 --> 23:19.900
Could I have everyone's attention, please?

23:19.983 --> 23:22.069
Donny, can you cut the feed?

23:23.153 --> 23:24.488
-Donny says we're good.
-Okay.

23:24.571 --> 23:26.907
I wanted to alert
everyone to some breaking news.

23:26.990 --> 23:29.451
It's still unconfirmed,
and I held off from saying anything

23:29.535 --> 23:32.579
'cause I didn't want to alarm anyone
if I didn't have to,

23:32.663 --> 23:34.581
but there are rumors leaking.

23:35.582 --> 23:38.919
So, Mitch Kessler was
in a car accident late last night,

23:39.002 --> 23:41.129
and it appears that he did not survive it.

23:42.172 --> 23:43.298
Oh, my God.

23:43.966 --> 23:47.344
In fact, it seems more
and more likely that he did not.

23:47.427 --> 23:49.346
Mitch Kessler worked
at The Morning Show for 15 years.

23:49.429 --> 23:50.430
This can't be true.

23:50.514 --> 23:54.685
And so, this may be difficult
for some of you, one way or another.

23:56.228 --> 23:57.479
So, until we know anything,

23:57.563 --> 24:00.566
I'm gonna ask you to please just keep on
doing what you're doing.

24:01.191 --> 24:04.528
And do not forget that
we are a news organization.

24:05.612 --> 24:11.034
This is highly, incredibly confidential,
unconfirmed information.

24:11.743 --> 24:13.245
So, please don't tell anyone.

24:15.706 --> 24:19.042
Mitch was-- Mitch is a human being.

24:21.461 --> 24:22.963
He has a family.

24:24.131 --> 24:28.886
And our job now is to get confirmation,
one way or another,

24:28.969 --> 24:30.387
before we do anything.

24:31.847 --> 24:33.724
Okay, thank you, everyone. Thank you.

24:34.725 --> 24:38.145
Hey, Mia. How sure are we?

24:38.979 --> 24:41.648
Something happened.
We're pretty sure of that.

24:43.025 --> 24:45.903
But the, uh,
the network wants Alex to break this news

24:45.986 --> 24:47.362
if there's any news to break.

24:51.158 --> 24:52.159
Come on.

24:55.871 --> 24:57.789
Pronto soccorso.

24:57.873 --> 24:59.708
Hi. Hi, do you speak English?

24:59.791 --> 25:01.043
Sì, sì. What do you need?

25:01.126 --> 25:04.379
Do you have,
an American patient there?

25:04.463 --> 25:05.797
Did-- Did you just call me?

25:05.881 --> 25:07.508
What? No, no, no. We've never spoken.

25:07.591 --> 25:09.426
Ah, sound like you. We are very busy.

25:09.510 --> 25:12.387
I understand. I just need to know
if you have, or had

25:12.471 --> 25:15.682
a patient by the name of Mitchell Kessler.
K-E-S-S-L-E-R.

25:17.184 --> 25:19.061
No. Nobody by that name.

25:19.144 --> 25:21.396
Seriously? Are-- You're sure?

25:21.980 --> 25:24.942
No American patients that were
in a car accident or anything?

25:25.025 --> 25:26.235
Oh, a man?

25:26.777 --> 25:30.864
Yes. White, in his 50s,
gray hair, beard.

25:31.448 --> 25:33.367
Sì. We get someone like that without ID.

25:33.909 --> 25:35.285
-Is he alive?
-I don't know.

25:35.369 --> 25:37.204
Tell me again. Leave your phone number.

25:37.287 --> 25:38.705
Look, I don't care about that.

25:38.789 --> 25:41.625
What I need to know is--
Was there a woman with him?

25:41.708 --> 25:44.461
-Sì, sì, sì.
-How is she?

25:45.045 --> 25:46.588
Honestly, not very good.

25:46.672 --> 25:48.841
Was her name Alex Levy? Did you get it?

25:48.924 --> 25:50.092
I don't know.

25:58.225 --> 25:59.726
Would you please call back a little later?

25:59.810 --> 26:00.811
-Wait.
-Thank you.

26:26.795 --> 26:27.796
Sorry.

26:30.674 --> 26:31.925
Sorry.

26:33.427 --> 26:34.469
Sorry.

26:34.553 --> 26:36.388
-He's expecting me.
-No, he's not.

26:36.471 --> 26:38.140
Yeah. I talked to-- I just talked to him.

26:38.223 --> 26:39.766
He's-- No, no. It's okay.

26:39.850 --> 26:40.934
Cory, I need your help.

26:43.395 --> 26:44.646
I need to speak with Cory.
Get out.

26:44.730 --> 26:46.106
I'm the president of UBA News.

26:46.190 --> 26:48.442
Anything you have to say about UBA News
you can say to me.

26:48.525 --> 26:51.361
And if this isn't about UBA News,
get the fuck out!

26:53.572 --> 26:55.991
-How about that? Yeah. Don't lie.
-Fine. I--

26:56.074 --> 26:57.659
-What? Is Alex here?
-Uh-- Tha-- No.

26:57.743 --> 26:59.161
-That's what I'm trying--
-Where is she?

26:59.244 --> 27:00.495
Can I speak?

27:00.579 --> 27:04.291
The last time I saw Alex was in Vegas.
I just found out that she is in Italy.

27:04.958 --> 27:07.252
And I think she--

27:10.005 --> 27:12.299
I think she might--
I think she might be dead.

27:12.966 --> 27:16.094
-What in the fuck are you talking about?
-You're just telling us this now?

27:16.178 --> 27:17.721
Who gives a fuck? Jesus. Fire me!

27:17.804 --> 27:19.515
You only hired me
because Alex forced you to.

27:19.598 --> 27:22.684
Cory, I'm coming to you, okay?
Because, on the off chance that

27:22.768 --> 27:27.105
she's not broken into a million pieces
on, like, Italian countryside,

27:27.189 --> 27:30.025
you'd keep it quiet, right?
Because you're on the hook for her.

27:30.108 --> 27:32.444
Have you reached out to anyone
in her family?

27:32.528 --> 27:34.905
I can't call her family
and scare the shit out of them.

27:34.988 --> 27:37.032
No one knows she went.
They're not gonna know anything.

27:37.115 --> 27:39.076
Wait. How do you know that
nobody knows she went?

27:39.159 --> 27:41.787
I-- Her assistant told me.

27:41.870 --> 27:44.957
Kyle! Get Alex Levy's assistant
up here right now!

27:45.040 --> 27:48.293
She's not gonna tell me anything more.
She doesn't like my kind, so it--

27:48.877 --> 27:50.087
-Talk to her?
-Yeah.

27:50.170 --> 27:52.673
People with asthma are breathing easier
this week

27:52.756 --> 27:56.510
as the FDA has approved
the first generic asthma inhaler

27:56.593 --> 27:59.179
as part of its efforts to improve access
to lower-cost drug options.

28:02.933 --> 28:05.018
…effective as
their brand-name counterparts

28:05.102 --> 28:07.187
while being much, much cheaper.

28:07.271 --> 28:11.149
UBA's Tyrese Parker has more
on this important new approval.

28:13.402 --> 28:14.403
Stand by, camera two.

28:19.199 --> 28:21.910
Mia, Clay Becker called back.
He's holding in the bullpen.

28:29.042 --> 28:31.545
-Hi. Clay? It's Mia Jordan.
-Hi, Mia.

28:31.628 --> 28:34.423
Sorry, it's still the middle of the night
here in California,

28:34.506 --> 28:36.550
and I wanted to be certain
before I called you back.

28:36.633 --> 28:37.676
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

28:37.759 --> 28:39.887
So, that was my car.

28:39.970 --> 28:42.222
Mitch has been staying at our place there,

28:42.306 --> 28:44.933
and from what I've gathered,
I think it's true.

28:45.684 --> 28:46.894
So, he's dead?

28:48.145 --> 28:50.564
Yeah, that's my understanding.

28:52.900 --> 28:54.359
Does his family know?

28:54.443 --> 28:56.612
I didn't think
it was my place to tell them.

28:56.695 --> 28:58.530
Normally, it would be the hospital,

28:58.614 --> 29:00.282
but they're inundated,

29:00.365 --> 29:04.203
and I guess he wasn't carrying
his passport or license.

29:04.286 --> 29:06.038
Yeah. Okay. All right.

29:06.121 --> 29:09.249
Yeah. If I hear anything else,
I'll let you know.

29:09.833 --> 29:10.959
-Thanks, Clay.
-Okay.

29:19.176 --> 29:21.970
So, we need the second confirmation
before I can run it.

29:24.014 --> 29:25.057
Okay.

29:28.268 --> 29:29.937
I'm gonna write the copy myself.

29:36.818 --> 29:39.446
Sorry. I-- I'm so sorry.
I had to lie down for a second,

29:39.530 --> 29:41.490
but I was feeling a little dizzy.
But I'm fine now.

29:41.573 --> 29:43.408
Yeah. Don't go anywhere.
I wanna talk to you.

29:43.492 --> 29:45.536
It's okay, Mia. We can talk another time.

29:46.161 --> 29:47.621
Can we not argue right now?

29:48.205 --> 29:49.373
Okay.

29:56.672 --> 29:58.006
I'm sorry about yesterday.

29:59.800 --> 30:01.593
Yesterday was a brain-fuck.

30:01.677 --> 30:04.680
This whole job is a brain-fuck.
Life is a brain-fuck.

30:06.223 --> 30:08.058
You have to go through life
pretending you don't know

30:08.141 --> 30:09.810
they're making you play
by different rules.

30:09.893 --> 30:12.521
You, like--
You think a guy at work likes you.

30:12.604 --> 30:15.482
You think he likes you for you
and that means enough to you, you know?

30:15.566 --> 30:18.193
You're willing to overlook
his wife and his children.

30:18.277 --> 30:19.945
Save that to beat yourself up another day.

30:20.028 --> 30:22.573
And then you start telling yourself
stories until you believe them.

30:22.656 --> 30:24.575
Because you know what? Maybe they're true.

30:26.159 --> 30:27.244
And then it ends.

30:29.204 --> 30:30.539
And he's petty.

30:30.622 --> 30:32.457
He acts like a jackass, but you…

30:33.458 --> 30:35.252
you persevere, you put it behind you.

30:35.335 --> 30:38.088
And then you get the job
you were after the whole time.

30:40.174 --> 30:43.594
Then they publish a book that says
that he didn't really like you for you,

30:45.095 --> 30:46.471
but you don't believe them.

30:47.764 --> 30:51.185
'Cause to believe them is to believe
that you weren't enough on your own.

30:53.437 --> 30:55.856
And then they lump you in
with a bunch of other women.

30:56.440 --> 30:58.984
Women who were legitimately victims of

30:59.067 --> 31:03.447
this empty, horny vessel
who wanted nothing but what he wanted.

31:04.531 --> 31:06.283
And that job you got,
why'd you get that job?

31:06.366 --> 31:08.911
To make it okay that you were victimized?
But you weren't.

31:11.330 --> 31:12.789
You were the side chick.

31:15.667 --> 31:17.127
Fuck Mitch.

31:17.211 --> 31:19.922
Fuck that guy
that put you in this situation.

31:20.422 --> 31:23.050
Fuck men. They only fuck up your life.

31:23.592 --> 31:24.843
Fuck everybody.

31:27.221 --> 31:29.515
That's where I was yesterday,
and I took it out on you.

31:29.598 --> 31:30.849
I am so sorry.

31:32.601 --> 31:36.438
Because I think I knew the real him,
and that book doesn't get the real him.

31:36.980 --> 31:38.690
And the real him is dead.

31:40.150 --> 31:42.444
Oh, God. It's just so sad.

31:43.320 --> 31:44.571
It's so sad.

31:50.661 --> 31:54.081
And I have to put my personal emotions
to the side and sum him up in…

31:55.457 --> 31:57.042
two minutes.

31:58.085 --> 32:00.587
Yes, I have her passwords.

32:01.421 --> 32:04.216
But it's
just because she doesn't remember them.

32:04.299 --> 32:08.428
You know, I'd never look in her email.
I can't do that.

32:08.512 --> 32:13.308
I mean, if she knew,
if she found out, she would fire me.

32:13.392 --> 32:15.686
I mean, she'd be really mad, and…

32:15.769 --> 32:17.312
Well, she might be dead.

32:19.273 --> 32:20.649
She's not dead.

32:20.732 --> 32:22.025
Have you spoken to her?

32:22.776 --> 32:24.945
Because we know she went to Italy.

32:25.487 --> 32:26.488
Italy?

32:26.572 --> 32:29.950
And we know that
Mitch just died in a car crash.

32:30.492 --> 32:32.536
And we know there is a woman with him.

32:34.621 --> 32:35.664
Oh, shit.

32:37.833 --> 32:38.917
Hey.

32:39.501 --> 32:41.044
Alex will understand.

32:42.296 --> 32:43.755
She will.

32:43.839 --> 32:47.593
She didn't get to where she is
by not being reasonable, right?

32:48.594 --> 32:51.305
We're all in this together. She'll get it.

32:52.431 --> 32:53.473
If she's not dead.

33:00.189 --> 33:02.232
Here. This may be something.

33:02.733 --> 33:06.069
She booked a flight to Teterboro.
It's supposed to land in half an hour.

33:06.153 --> 33:08.197
Thank you.
Now let's just hope she was on it.

33:08.280 --> 33:09.740
Oh, my God. Oh, my God.

33:09.823 --> 33:11.742
People are gonna find out where she was.

33:13.493 --> 33:14.870
Right. What do we do about that?

33:14.953 --> 33:16.747
I don't know.
That's the fun of it. Now go.

33:22.127 --> 33:23.128
Sorry.

33:24.463 --> 33:25.672
Okay, yeah.

33:27.883 --> 33:28.926
Okay.

33:29.009 --> 33:30.093
Kyle.

33:30.177 --> 33:33.472
According to the NCES, in 2017,

33:33.555 --> 33:38.727
one in five US students, ages 12 to 18,
said they were bullied at school.

33:38.810 --> 33:40.103
Can you believe that number?

33:40.187 --> 33:44.650
-20%? I forget how cruel kids can be.
-Well, it's really heartbreaking.

33:44.733 --> 33:46.818
But there are also some brave,
extraordinary kids…

33:46.902 --> 33:48.570
Bradley, you need to get out
to the hallway.

33:48.654 --> 33:50.364
Your brother's here. It's bad.

33:50.906 --> 33:52.908
You spoke to one of them,
didn't you, Bradley?

33:52.991 --> 33:54.117
That-- That's right.

33:54.201 --> 33:56.662
Earlier this month,
I sat down with Lee Bauer,

33:56.745 --> 34:00.249
one young student who told me that
he had it up to here with being bullied.

34:00.332 --> 34:02.960
And what he did next was
pretty remarkable.

34:03.752 --> 34:05.128
We're clear.

34:09.466 --> 34:14.638
Where the New York City winters aren't
Bleeding me

34:15.138 --> 34:17.099
Leading me

34:17.181 --> 34:19.434
Hey, look. That's--
That's my sister right there.

34:19.518 --> 34:21.018
-Hey.
-See?

34:21.103 --> 34:24.313
-Bradley, tell this guy you're my sister.
-Hal, what are you doing here?

34:24.398 --> 34:27.609
-I come to see you. Hey, buddy.
-Okay. Uh, okay.

34:28.110 --> 34:29.110
Okay.

34:29.194 --> 34:30.779
I'm fine. He's my brother. It's--

34:30.862 --> 34:32.697
-You sure?
-Yeah, it's okay. Thank you, Jimbo.

34:32.781 --> 34:35.117
Yeah. I came all the way to New York,
you don't even invite me…

34:35.199 --> 34:37.202
-Okay. You need to go now.
-…to see where you work?

34:37.286 --> 34:39.621
-Okay? I'm at-- I'm at work.
-Why? I don--

34:39.705 --> 34:42.833
Do I remind--
I remind you of Dad or something?

34:43.208 --> 34:45.752
-What?
-You are ashamed of me.

34:45.835 --> 34:47.754
-And that hurts, Bradley.
-Okay, look--

34:47.838 --> 34:50.549
-Is everything okay?
-It's fine. Rena, you can go.

34:50.632 --> 34:51.925
Really. He's just having a bad day.

34:52.009 --> 34:53.260
-You wanted me to go.
-Come on.

34:53.342 --> 34:54.844
You don't have to leave,
but have some coffee.

34:54.928 --> 34:57.681
-Do you hear me? Sit down.
-I'll have a cup of coffee. Coffee's good.

34:57.764 --> 35:00.767
Come-on from the whores
On Seventh Avenue

35:00.851 --> 35:02.394
And you have to be quiet, Hal.

35:02.477 --> 35:04.229
Why? It's a TV station.

35:04.313 --> 35:06.398
I could be discovered, like you.

35:06.481 --> 35:08.400
I'm laying out my winter clothes

35:08.483 --> 35:09.985
You have to shut the fuck up.

35:10.736 --> 35:12.154
Why?

35:12.237 --> 35:14.281
'Cause they think
Mitch Kessler died last night.

35:21.705 --> 35:26.877
I am just a poor boy
Though my story's seldom told

35:26.960 --> 35:28.128
Hal, what are you doing?

35:28.212 --> 35:29.338
Na-na-na na, na-na-na-na…

35:29.421 --> 35:31.715
Hey, Bradley, are you coming back soon?

35:33.091 --> 35:35.719
Oh, my God. That's your girlfriend.

35:38.472 --> 35:39.848
Please don't do this here.

35:39.932 --> 35:42.100
You don't have to leave,
but please don't do this here.

35:43.393 --> 35:44.937
Hey, Bradley.

35:45.020 --> 35:46.104
What?

35:46.188 --> 35:47.981
Did Mitch Kessler kill himself?

35:48.690 --> 35:50.150
No, it was a car accident.

35:51.693 --> 35:52.903
Did he kill anybody?

35:53.529 --> 35:54.821
Hal, I don't know.

35:56.281 --> 35:58.242
Well… Hi.

35:58.867 --> 36:00.494
Our dad,

36:00.577 --> 36:03.789
he killed a kid driving drunk.

36:03.872 --> 36:05.958
And we were in the car.

36:06.041 --> 36:08.252
Oh, my God. You fucking asshole.

36:08.335 --> 36:10.337
-What? What?
-Why would you do this to me?

36:10.420 --> 36:12.005
See, this-- You do this shit all the time.

36:12.089 --> 36:13.882
-You act like you care.
-Hal, you have to go.

36:13.966 --> 36:15.342
-You ain't listening.
-Leave right now!

36:15.425 --> 36:17.594
-You fucking leave me to die. No.
-You need to leave.

36:17.678 --> 36:19.054
Searching for the places on the-

36:19.137 --> 36:19.972
Hey!

36:20.055 --> 36:21.390
-Lie-la-lie!
-Call security.

36:21.473 --> 36:24.601
-Lie-la-lie lie-lie-lie-lie!
-Oh.

36:25.352 --> 36:27.646
Lie-la-lie lie-lie-lie-lie!

36:29.147 --> 36:30.190
Lie-la-lie!

36:32.276 --> 36:34.403
Lie-la-lie… lie-lie-lie

36:36.697 --> 36:38.073
Lie-la-lie

36:38.907 --> 36:41.660
Hey. Don't touch me.

36:47.416 --> 36:49.835
No, no, get off me.

36:49.918 --> 36:52.713
No. No! No. No.

36:53.463 --> 36:56.884
Brad. Brad. Brad! Bradley! No.

36:56.967 --> 37:00.429
Hey! Bradley, fucking help me! Help me.

37:00.512 --> 37:02.848
Fucking help me. Brad.

37:02.931 --> 37:04.725
Brad, please don't-- Please.

37:04.808 --> 37:07.477
I'm-- Bradley, I'm sorry.
I'm fucking-- I'm sorry.

37:07.561 --> 37:08.562
Help!

37:09.062 --> 37:10.063
Fucking help me!

37:52.272 --> 37:55.067
-Okay, okay.
-I can't go out there.

37:55.150 --> 37:57.194
No, you can. You can.

37:58.445 --> 37:59.821
It's gonna be okay.

38:00.531 --> 38:02.741
People judging you is a bitch,
but it doesn't kill you.

38:02.824 --> 38:06.662
I don't-- I don't know what to do.
Am I a horrible person?

38:06.745 --> 38:08.956
No, no. No.

38:10.374 --> 38:13.168
But you do need to take a cold,
hard look at your life.

38:14.044 --> 38:17.673
You're just gonna have to, Bradley. Okay?

38:17.756 --> 38:18.632
Yeah.

38:20.217 --> 38:22.219
Have you ever had therapy?

38:26.390 --> 38:28.308
I'm afraid they'll tell me I'm crazy.

38:28.892 --> 38:29.935
You're not crazy.

38:30.018 --> 38:31.520
-I'm not?
-No.

38:31.603 --> 38:37.067
You learned behaviors to help you survive
as a kid in a crazy environment.

38:38.068 --> 38:39.862
Okay. They're not helping you now.

38:39.945 --> 38:43.574
Oh, my God.
My family has just really fucked me up.

38:44.992 --> 38:48.370
And I love them so much,
but I can't fix them.

38:48.453 --> 38:51.874
Right. So maybe it's time
that you stepped away from them.

38:53.792 --> 38:56.295
I-- I tried to make Hal go home.

38:56.378 --> 38:58.422
And then he just sucked
you right back in, didn't he?

38:58.505 --> 39:00.424
But he's a mess and it's not his fault.

39:00.507 --> 39:03.302
He's bipolar, and he has terrible parents.

39:03.385 --> 39:05.345
We have terrible parents.

39:05.429 --> 39:07.181
Look, Bradley, listen to me.

39:09.558 --> 39:11.935
I get that it's not his fault. I get it.

39:13.437 --> 39:15.230
But at a certain point,

39:15.314 --> 39:18.483
it doesn't matter why he's the way he is.

39:18.567 --> 39:22.404
It just matters that he's bringing
chaos to your life,

39:22.487 --> 39:25.616
and he isn't interested
in changing, you know?

39:25.699 --> 39:27.284
You-- You have to think about you.

39:27.951 --> 39:31.622
Right? What is right for you?
Think about that.

39:35.000 --> 39:39.046
Look, I've had to walk away
from people in my family. It is not easy.

39:39.129 --> 39:40.214
You have?

39:41.465 --> 39:42.925
But in the end, it's just harder.

39:43.008 --> 39:44.468
Oh, my God.

39:45.344 --> 39:48.555
I can't imagine leaving my baby brother.

39:48.639 --> 39:50.474
I-- I can't abandon him.

39:50.557 --> 39:55.354
Okay, so if he wants to change,
you can put him in rehab.

39:57.189 --> 39:59.274
But honestly, honestly, honey,

40:00.317 --> 40:02.110
I think you might have to walk away.

40:05.697 --> 40:06.907
It's your life, Bradley.

40:06.990 --> 40:09.034
It's yours. Not his.

40:49.116 --> 40:50.117
Hey.

40:52.452 --> 40:53.662
You're okay.

40:55.706 --> 40:59.459
-Hey, hey, why are you crying?
-I'm just so happy you found me.

41:02.588 --> 41:03.589
I'm happy you found me.

41:04.882 --> 41:06.884
I was really worried about you.

41:10.554 --> 41:13.223
Look, I have to--
I have to tell you something.

41:14.266 --> 41:15.267
What?

41:21.565 --> 41:22.983
We think Mitch is dead.

41:28.697 --> 41:31.491
No, I'm-- No.

41:32.075 --> 41:33.535
I was just with him.

41:33.619 --> 41:35.120
-I-- I know.
-I was just with him.

41:35.204 --> 41:37.122
I'm-- I'm-- I'm very sorry.

41:37.206 --> 41:39.249
No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

41:39.333 --> 41:40.584
-It's okay.
-No, no, no.

41:40.667 --> 41:42.920
-Let me get you to the car--
-No, no, no, no, no…

41:43.003 --> 41:44.630
-I'm very sorry, I'm--
-No, no.

41:44.713 --> 41:47.466
-He-- It was-- It was a car accident.
-No, no. Oh, my gosh-- A car accident?

41:47.549 --> 41:50.594
Yes, it was an accident.
And the network wants you to report it.

41:50.677 --> 41:53.889
So-- It's okay. It's--

41:53.972 --> 41:56.475
Look, they're waiting on
a second confirmation right now.

41:56.558 --> 41:58.143
Apparently he didn't have an ID on him.

41:58.227 --> 41:59.228
-So…
-No, no.

41:59.311 --> 42:01.355
-Italy is a shit show right now.
-Yes, but--

42:01.438 --> 42:04.775
But there was no one with him. So there's
no one to confirm what happened.

42:04.858 --> 42:06.527
-Give me your phone.
-What?

42:06.610 --> 42:08.070
-Give me your phone.
-What? Oh--

42:08.153 --> 42:10.781
-Give me your-- Give me your phone.
-What? Here. Here.

42:18.747 --> 42:19.998
Fido.

42:32.845 --> 42:33.929
Pronto.

42:34.680 --> 42:37.432
Paola, it's Alex Levy.

42:48.527 --> 42:50.863
I'm sorry, Alex. He's dead.

42:59.872 --> 43:01.206
Were you with him?

43:01.290 --> 43:03.166
Not in the car. I…

43:05.711 --> 43:06.628
Later.

43:07.421 --> 43:09.423
In the hospital.

43:09.923 --> 43:11.216
I found him.

43:12.634 --> 43:15.387
I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry.

43:16.555 --> 43:17.764
Me too.

43:19.516 --> 43:20.851
Alex…

43:22.561 --> 43:24.104
he loved you very much.

43:26.106 --> 43:27.232
Ciao.

44:14.071 --> 44:16.949
Does Paige know? Do the kids know?

44:17.032 --> 44:18.659
I don't think so. No.

44:19.451 --> 44:20.619
I should tell her.

44:21.286 --> 44:22.829
You-- You wanna call 'em?

44:24.748 --> 44:28.502
No. No, I-- I should tell her in person.

44:28.585 --> 44:30.379
That would just be the right thing to do.

44:30.963 --> 44:33.632
So, to be clear,
instead of going in, you wanna…

44:34.216 --> 44:35.926
Right now, yes. Yes.

44:36.009 --> 44:37.052
Okay.

44:37.636 --> 44:41.181
She needs to hear it from someone
who cares about him, you know?

44:42.307 --> 44:44.309
…this next segment…

44:44.393 --> 44:46.603
Ty's Trends without Ty.

44:46.687 --> 44:48.689
So,
should we take turns reading…

44:48.772 --> 44:50.107
Oh, yeah.

44:50.190 --> 44:52.860
Where are you? You were supposed
to bring Alex in an hour ago.

44:52.943 --> 44:54.069
Mia, hi.

44:55.028 --> 44:58.615
I'm not-- I'm not coming in right now,
and that's my decision, okay?

45:00.450 --> 45:01.702
But I do have--

45:02.786 --> 45:04.538
I did get a second confirmation.

45:09.293 --> 45:12.588
So we're gonna go
and tell Paige in person, okay?

45:14.715 --> 45:18.218
I'm sorry
it won't be in the first two hours,

45:18.302 --> 45:20.179
but when Paige knows,
we'll let you guys know,

45:20.262 --> 45:22.139
and then you can go to air with it, okay?

45:23.140 --> 45:24.683
Alex, I don't need you to do this.

45:24.766 --> 45:27.603
Whatever, okay.
I'll see-- I'll speak to you soon.

45:28.187 --> 45:29.188
Hang it up.

45:29.855 --> 45:30.981
Thanks, Mia.

45:33.066 --> 45:34.318
I'm proud of you.

45:35.694 --> 45:36.653
Jesus.

45:38.530 --> 45:43.327
How many messages did--
My God. How many messages did you--

45:48.498 --> 45:49.833
Is there a problem?

45:50.542 --> 45:52.920
-Is this about Maggie's book?
-No. No, no, no. I was--

45:53.003 --> 45:54.505
-What's--
-I was just worried about you.

45:54.588 --> 45:55.881
That's-- It's-- That's it.

45:55.964 --> 45:57.925
-What?
-I was worried. It's fine.

45:59.092 --> 46:02.429
And now that I know you're safe
you just delete them, because…

46:02.513 --> 46:05.516
-You dumb fucking asshole!
-It's, um. You can just--

46:05.599 --> 46:06.808
You don't even have to-- Here.

46:06.892 --> 46:08.560
Don't listen to that one.
Don't listen to that--

46:08.644 --> 46:10.812
No, no, no, no, no, no. Oh, God.

46:10.896 --> 46:12.606
Please. Alex, don't listen to it.

46:12.689 --> 46:14.191
-I'm-- Stop it.
-Oh, my God.

46:14.274 --> 46:16.693
I was really, really angry and I just…

46:16.777 --> 46:18.487
-I lost--
-What the fuck?

46:18.570 --> 46:23.033
Oh, my God. I am so, so sorry.
I didn't mean that. I didn't mean that.

46:23.116 --> 46:25.160
I did not-- I did not mean that.

46:25.244 --> 46:26.495
…juicy ounce of humanity…

46:26.578 --> 46:28.872
-Alex, Alex, listen. Please.
-…out of your dry fucking soul…

46:28.956 --> 46:31.250
Please do not listen to this.
Please, just turn it off. Seriously.

46:31.333 --> 46:33.210
-Just stop!
-This is really not the time.

46:33.293 --> 46:35.337
-Stop it, please!
-It is not the fucking time.

46:35.420 --> 46:36.922
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

46:37.005 --> 46:40.008
We were having some negativity
towards each other, and we're past it now.

46:40.092 --> 46:41.844
-Are we? My God. Good to know.
-I'm moving past it.

46:41.927 --> 46:44.221
-I didn't know that we-- Oh.
-Alex, don't do this to us.

46:44.304 --> 46:46.014
-We're finally in a good place, okay?
-Oh, God.

46:46.098 --> 46:47.391
-Please, just--
-Oh.

46:47.891 --> 46:51.562
This is a really brutal day.

46:51.645 --> 46:55.274
I want you to know that
I have forgiven you for all of--

46:55.357 --> 46:56.817
Wait, what the fuck?

46:56.900 --> 46:59.528
Forgiven me for what the fuck?

46:59.611 --> 47:00.946
Are you kidding me?

47:01.029 --> 47:04.616
Jesus, why are you not letting me feel
what I should be feeling right now?

47:04.700 --> 47:06.535
Fuck you for this!

47:06.618 --> 47:07.953
Wait, why are you mad at me?

47:08.036 --> 47:10.163
I was the one who was
about to forgive you for all the--

47:10.247 --> 47:12.749
-For what?
-For what? For what?

47:12.833 --> 47:13.876
Yes, for what?

47:13.959 --> 47:15.127
Let's see. Let's get the list out.

47:15.210 --> 47:16.211
-Okay, here we go.
-Jesus.

47:16.295 --> 47:17.546
-How about for…
-Fucking asshole.

47:17.629 --> 47:19.047
…bailing on a presidential debate.

47:19.131 --> 47:21.550
-Then flying off to Italy to rendezvous…
-Oh…

47:21.633 --> 47:24.469
-…with a vicious sexual predator…
-Oh, shut up.

47:24.553 --> 47:26.555
…while in the middle of
a burgeoning pandemic.

47:26.638 --> 47:29.641
-You don't understand. You don't.
-Then lying to me that you had a bad back.

47:29.725 --> 47:32.561
I was trying to save our careers.
If I fucking go, you fucking go.

47:32.644 --> 47:35.189
Save our careers? How? How do you save--

47:35.272 --> 47:37.941
-You gonna go out by fucking Mitch?
-I did not fuck Mitch!

47:38.025 --> 47:39.610
-Again?
-Oh, my gosh.

47:39.693 --> 47:41.278
How do I know?
How do I know what to believe?

47:41.361 --> 47:43.197
-How do I know anything?
-Are you jealous?

47:43.280 --> 47:44.948
-Is that what this is about?
-Oh, come on!

47:45.032 --> 47:47.993
-Your fucking vanity knows no bounds.
-Oh, for God--

47:48.076 --> 47:52.706
Jealous of that dumb, dead asshole
who ruined my life and all of our lives?

47:52.789 --> 47:54.625
Yeah, I'm jealous of Mitch. I'm jealous.

47:54.708 --> 47:56.752
-I'm jealous of Hitler too!
-How dare you?

47:56.835 --> 47:58.545
-God!
-Oh, my fucking God.

47:58.629 --> 48:01.798
It's not his fucking fault
that you were born without a spine.

48:01.882 --> 48:03.592
-I told you not to listen to it.
-Jesus!

48:03.675 --> 48:06.261
See? Now it's my fault
'cause I listened to the fucking message.

48:06.345 --> 48:09.765
God, you only wanna listen to the message
and respond to it

48:09.848 --> 48:11.225
when it helps your career,

48:11.308 --> 48:15.020
but maybe when a person spills their heart

48:15.103 --> 48:18.524
onto your answering machine
after you got them fired…

48:18.607 --> 48:20.526
-Oh, my God. I was sparing you.
-…ruined their career--

48:20.609 --> 48:23.862
-I was trying to spare you, idiot.
-Sparing me? You fucking ruined my career!

48:23.946 --> 48:25.822
It'll never get through
that thick fucking head of yours

48:25.906 --> 48:28.617
that I don't wanna suck your dick.
Never, ever, never!

48:29.284 --> 48:33.163
Okay? Sorry about that. Jesus.

48:35.874 --> 48:37.501
There she is, America's sweetheart.

48:37.584 --> 48:39.920
Oh, fuck you. I hate you so much.

48:40.003 --> 48:41.880
-I hate you so much.
-I hate you so much.

48:41.964 --> 48:43.799
If I ever say anything different

48:43.882 --> 48:46.343
-then you know I'm lying to you so bad.
-So fucking much.

48:46.426 --> 48:48.136
-I hate you so fucking much!
-I hate you.

48:48.220 --> 48:49.555
-Jesus Christ.
-Shut up!

48:49.638 --> 48:52.641
-Why didn't you respond to the messages?
-Get me out of here, please!

49:31.680 --> 49:33.974
Alex, hi.

49:34.057 --> 49:35.726
Oh, God.

49:35.809 --> 49:37.102
Teddy.

49:38.478 --> 49:39.813
Hi, honey.

49:44.234 --> 49:47.446
Oh, God. It's so good to see you.

49:47.529 --> 49:48.697
Is your mama home?

49:49.364 --> 49:50.282
She's meditating.

49:50.949 --> 49:53.452
-Do you want me to go get her?
-I'd really appreciate it.

49:54.453 --> 49:56.163
-Okay.
-Mom?

49:56.246 --> 49:57.623
Mom, Alex is here.

49:57.706 --> 49:58.790
Fuck.

50:02.753 --> 50:03.837
Alex.

50:03.921 --> 50:05.339
Paige.

50:06.006 --> 50:07.841
I'm so sorry to show up unannounced.

50:11.845 --> 50:13.931
I just have to tell you that, um…

50:16.892 --> 50:18.769
Mitch was in a car accident…

50:21.271 --> 50:22.814
and he didn't make it.

50:34.701 --> 50:36.370
Thank you.

50:36.453 --> 50:38.205
-Yes. Of course.
-For telling me.

50:38.288 --> 50:40.874
Would you like to talk or anything?

50:41.750 --> 50:43.168
I'm right here for you.

50:48.340 --> 50:50.467
What does that-- What does that mean?

50:51.885 --> 50:52.886
Alex.

50:53.637 --> 50:55.055
I've always known.

50:56.473 --> 51:00.435
Most of the time I had no idea
who those girls were,

51:00.519 --> 51:02.396
so what difference did it make?

51:02.479 --> 51:03.897
But you knew me.

51:04.648 --> 51:08.735
And unlike all those other poor girls,
you didn't have to do it, did you?

51:12.739 --> 51:13.740
No.

51:14.241 --> 51:17.703
And you would see me
at parties and hug me.

51:20.622 --> 51:22.583
Paige, I--

51:30.507 --> 51:32.217
It only happened twice.

51:34.845 --> 51:38.015
Only twice? Wow.

51:39.224 --> 51:40.350
Thank you for that.

51:41.935 --> 51:43.645
You two were made for each other.

51:46.356 --> 51:49.776
You might even be the same person
for all I can tell, so…

51:50.569 --> 51:52.237
I'm sorry for your loss.

52:50.087 --> 52:51.588
Hey, it's Mia.

52:52.548 --> 52:53.757
Hi, Mia.

52:55.676 --> 52:57.177
So I just told Paige.

52:59.179 --> 53:00.639
You should be good to go.

53:01.098 --> 53:02.641
Okay. Thanks for calling.

53:03.141 --> 53:04.309
Hey, listen--

53:05.769 --> 53:08.313
-Is Bradley there, by any chance?
-Yeah.

53:08.981 --> 53:11.108
-Would you mind putting her on, please?
-Sure.

53:11.191 --> 53:12.609
Hello?

53:13.527 --> 53:14.736
Bradley…

53:15.946 --> 53:18.907
I just want you to know that
I really think, actually,

53:18.991 --> 53:21.285
that you're the right person to do this.

53:21.368 --> 53:23.453
You know, to break the news.

53:24.454 --> 53:25.706
Why do you say that?

53:25.789 --> 53:27.124
Because…

53:28.250 --> 53:29.918
everything's changing.

53:31.295 --> 53:33.922
And you were the start of that change.

53:36.133 --> 53:38.135
And I just want you
to know that I really--

53:38.802 --> 53:40.512
I so appreciate you.

53:41.889 --> 53:43.640
You know? That's all.

53:46.727 --> 53:50.022
Welcome back.
We're interrupting with some breaking news

53:50.105 --> 53:52.065
that we want you to hear from us first.

53:53.150 --> 53:54.484
Bradley?

53:54.568 --> 53:57.905
UBA can be the first to confirm that
former Morning Show anchor,

53:57.988 --> 54:01.950
and one of the most iconic personalities
in morning television history,

54:02.034 --> 54:04.953
Mitch Kessler has tragically died

54:05.037 --> 54:08.999
in a single-car accident
in northern Italy during the night.

54:09.666 --> 54:11.043
He was 52 years old.

54:11.919 --> 54:16.215
He is survived by his ex-wife, Paige,
and their children, Teddy and Jeff.

54:17.090 --> 54:21.053
Kessler was part of
the UBA news family for over 20 years,

54:21.678 --> 54:23.805
winning eight Emmys during his tenure.

54:24.598 --> 54:27.559
His time here came
to an abrupt end last year

54:27.643 --> 54:32.231
after reporting revealed
multiple incidents of sexual misconduct

54:32.314 --> 54:34.775
over the course of his employment at UBA.

54:35.859 --> 54:38.111
His television career was illustrious.

54:38.695 --> 54:41.156
As a broadcaster, he was impeccable,

54:41.240 --> 54:45.244
sharp, engaging, funny, empathetic.

54:45.869 --> 54:49.540
In his personal life,
and behind the scenes on this show,

54:49.623 --> 54:52.084
he leaves a more tarnished legacy.

54:52.960 --> 54:56.421
Transition, for society, is rarely easy.

54:57.047 --> 55:03.262
Reconciling who we were with who we are
with who we want to be is challenging.

55:03.887 --> 55:07.099
Figuring out what from the
past we need to remember,

55:07.182 --> 55:09.268
to forgive, to learn from,

55:10.102 --> 55:11.687
or to ignore,

55:11.770 --> 55:13.897
is impossible to do elegantly.

55:14.481 --> 55:19.236
People at this workplace suffered
from Mitch's inability to do any of that.

55:20.070 --> 55:23.532
And for that,
many are still paying the price.
