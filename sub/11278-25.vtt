Mr. Boyd.                       

00:21.600 --> 00:23.300
Oh, hey, that's me.             

00:23.400 --> 00:26.200
Oh, yeah, I ordered             
this weeks ago.                 

00:26.200 --> 00:28.500
This is a whole big book        
of crossword puzzles.           

00:28.500 --> 00:29.800
                All right. Well,
        let's check them out.   

00:29.900 --> 00:30.700
  Hey, this is great            

00:30.900 --> 00:32.299
because it has all              
the answers in the back         

00:32.400 --> 00:36.100
so we don't have to worry       
about all those confusing clues.

00:36.100 --> 00:37.600
All right,                      

00:37.700 --> 00:38.900
        one across.             

00:39.000 --> 00:40.200
        "Penguin."              

00:40.300 --> 00:43.400
                        Penguin?

00:43.400 --> 00:45.200
    Hey, hey, hey, it fits.     

00:45.200 --> 00:47.400
            All right!          

00:47.500 --> 00:50.000
Hey, these are great once       
 you get the hang of them, huh?

01:36.400 --> 01:37.700
Oh, hey, Miss Howe.             

01:37.700 --> 01:39.900
                  You look nice.
            What's the occasion?

01:39.900 --> 01:42.800
Well, I just signed up with     
an executive placement agency,  

01:42.900 --> 01:43.900
      and I have all sorts      
         of interviews          

01:43.900 --> 01:45.100
    lined up this afternoon.    

01:45.100 --> 01:46.700
 I feel really great about it.  

01:46.700 --> 01:51.000
I'm finally gonna get myself out
of this brain-dead mausoleum.   

01:51.000 --> 01:53.700
     Oh, no offense, guys.      

01:53.800 --> 01:55.900
              Huh?              

01:57.600 --> 01:59.000
        Well, I'm off.          

01:59.100 --> 02:00.200
        Good luck, Miss Howe.   

02:00.300 --> 02:01.700
         Thanks, Woody,         
      but I don't need it.      

02:01.800 --> 02:03.500
  I'm wearing my lucky dress.   
         I can't lose.          

02:03.500 --> 02:05.400
                Hi, Sam. I'm off
                to get a job.   

02:05.500 --> 02:06.800
Nothing can stop me now.        

02:06.800 --> 02:07.900
                        In that?

02:07.900 --> 02:09.000
Oh, who am I fooling?           

02:09.100 --> 02:11.000
They're not going to hire       
a loser like me.                

02:14.300 --> 02:15.700
Hey, just saw                   

02:15.800 --> 02:17.500
the neatest little present      
      in this kids' shop.       

02:17.500 --> 02:19.300
         Look at this.          

02:19.500 --> 02:22.200
      Does this say little      
  Freddie Crane or what, huh?   

02:22.200 --> 02:24.200
"Babe hound in training."       

02:26.100 --> 02:28.500
        Afternoon, all.         

02:28.500 --> 02:29.700
        Hey, Dr. Crane.         

02:29.800 --> 02:31.100
    Dr. Sternin-Crane.          

02:31.200 --> 02:34.300
      And little Frederick      
Crane-Sternin-Crane-Crane.      

02:36.100 --> 02:36.900
      What can I get you?       

02:37.000 --> 02:38.800
    I know I could use          
    a glass of water.           

02:40.800 --> 02:42.200
     Hey, it's my best pal.     

02:42.200 --> 02:43.900
                  Well, hello to
                  you, too, Sam.

02:44.000 --> 02:46.100
                  Oh, hey, Fras.

02:46.100 --> 02:47.700
                      Hi, there.

02:47.800 --> 02:49.200
                Give me five.   

02:49.300 --> 02:51.200
                      Pow!      

02:51.200 --> 02:53.000
                 So what are you
                guys doing here?

02:53.100 --> 02:56.200
Someone got a little            
thirsty while we were           
playing in the park.            

02:56.300 --> 02:58.000
                Aw, yeah, I see.
                Need some juice?

02:58.000 --> 02:59.700
          You said it.          
      Scotch on the rocks.      

02:59.700 --> 03:02.500
                I'm joking.     

03:02.600 --> 03:04.600
            No, Sam, Uh, just   
            a little apple juice

03:04.700 --> 03:06.300
    and, uh, a couple           
        of ginger ales.         

03:11.400 --> 03:13.000
      We're having quality      
          family time.          

03:13.100 --> 03:14.500
                        FRASIER:
                That's right.   

03:14.600 --> 03:17.200
  I canceled every single one   
of my appointments today.       

03:17.300 --> 03:18.900
LILITH:                         
And I called in                 
sick to the lab.                

03:19.000 --> 03:21.700
      I placed some gauze       
    over the telephone          

03:21.800 --> 03:24.800
and altered my voice            
so as to appear ill.            

03:24.900 --> 03:26.900
        And the Oscar goes to...

03:29.800 --> 03:31.400
              Here we are, dear.

03:31.500 --> 03:34.500
          So, we decided to have
              a lovely afternoon
                  with a picnic,

03:34.600 --> 03:37.300
            and now we're off   
            to go fly a kite.   

03:37.400 --> 03:38.900
    Oh, hey, I noticed          
    it was windy, too.          

03:38.900 --> 03:41.100
  I went out and I got little   
Frederick this kite, huh?       

03:41.200 --> 03:42.200
    What do you think?          

03:42.200 --> 03:44.200
                        I've got
                        an idea.

03:44.200 --> 03:46.500
  Why don't we, uh, why don't   
    we go try these babies.     

03:46.600 --> 03:48.600
      I'll be right back.       
    I'm gonna get my jacket.    

03:48.600 --> 03:50.600
Sam is tagging along?           

03:50.600 --> 03:52.700
We need some time               
to ourselves.                   

03:52.700 --> 03:55.100
                 Well, you know,
             darling, it is Sam.

03:55.200 --> 03:56.500
Frasier, am I going             

03:56.500 --> 03:59.300
to have to play "bad cop?"      

03:59.300 --> 04:02.100
Now, let me understand...       

04:02.200 --> 04:04.800
      are you saying that       
    up, up until this point,    

04:04.900 --> 04:07.100
you've been playing "good cop?" 

04:10.400 --> 04:12.800
Hey, Frasier, I've got an idea. 
  We can tie your little kite   

04:12.800 --> 04:14.900
    to the end of this          
     and make a great tail.     

04:21.300 --> 04:22.400
    (doorbell ringing)          

04:22.500 --> 04:23.500
            Coming.             

04:23.600 --> 04:25.100
          I'm coming.           

04:27.800 --> 04:29.000
         Oh, it's you.          

04:29.100 --> 04:31.300
     Yeah. Hi, hi, Lilith.      

04:31.300 --> 04:32.600
    Hey, look at you.           

04:32.700 --> 04:34.200
You've got hair like a woman.   

04:36.900 --> 04:39.100
I'm here to watch               
 <i>Huckleberry Hound.</i>             

04:39.200 --> 04:40.800
                At 5:53 a.m.?   

04:40.900 --> 04:41.900
Yeah. Yeah.                     

04:41.900 --> 04:43.100
Yesterday, me                   
and Freddie decided             

04:43.200 --> 04:44.900
    we're gonna watch           
         some cartoons.         

04:44.900 --> 04:47.700
          Who decided?          
  The child can barely speak.   

04:47.700 --> 04:50.700
    Well, he can nod.           
         Hey, Frasier.          

04:50.800 --> 04:52.800
Hey, Freddie, we're gonna       
      watch the cartoons.       

05:00.400 --> 05:02.700
That wasn't Sam Malone, was it? 

05:04.000 --> 05:06.600
         Please tell me         
  that was an armed intruder.   

05:06.600 --> 05:08.100
          It was Sam.           

05:08.200 --> 05:09.700
      Frasier, you've got       
        to do something.        

05:09.700 --> 05:11.000
Every day he gets here          

05:11.000 --> 05:12.000
    a little earlier,           

05:12.100 --> 05:14.200
        and every night         
he leaves a little later.       

05:14.200 --> 05:16.300
         Well, darling,         
  he, he is a friend of ours.   

05:16.300 --> 05:18.000
    It's getting so we can't    
make love in the morning.       

05:18.100 --> 05:21.800
I didn't know we could make love
        in the morning.         

05:23.400 --> 05:25.100
              We can't.         

05:25.200 --> 05:26.800
 It was just a "for instance."  

05:28.100 --> 05:29.500
The point is                    

05:29.500 --> 05:31.800
 I don't like people seeing me  
        in my nightgown.        

05:31.900 --> 05:33.600
  It undermines my authority.   

05:33.700 --> 05:36.000
    I really wouldn't worry     
          about that.           

05:37.700 --> 05:40.400
     Frasier, do something.     

05:40.400 --> 05:43.700
    Well, my love, let's...     

05:43.700 --> 05:48.700
 let's try to use some insight  
 into what Sam's going through. 

05:48.800 --> 05:51.700
                His affection   
                for Frederick   

05:51.800 --> 05:53.800
            is not unusual under
              the circumstances.

05:53.900 --> 05:55.700
                 After all, he's
                an aging playboy

05:55.800 --> 05:58.000
        who is just now         
    coming to realize           

05:58.100 --> 06:00.500
    that... he has nothing,     

06:00.600 --> 06:02.900
         and that he's          
      got no progeny left       

06:02.900 --> 06:04.700
     to carry on his name.      

06:04.800 --> 06:07.400
And that is a frightening       
    revelation for any man.     

06:07.500 --> 06:10.700
    Frasier, it's 5:55          
        in the morning.         

06:10.800 --> 06:11.600
         The heave-ho.          

06:14.800 --> 06:17.800
      Sam, could you come       
    down here, please?          

06:19.300 --> 06:21.600
Oh, good timing.                
Commercial's on.                

06:21.600 --> 06:23.300
          Sam, there's something
             we have to ask you.

06:23.400 --> 06:24.900
Yeah, good,                     

06:25.000 --> 06:26.500
because there's something       
    we have to ask you, too.    

06:26.600 --> 06:27.700
     What's for breakfast?      

06:29.300 --> 06:31.900
He's reacting to the nightgown. 

06:35.000 --> 06:37.800
              Sam, look, as much
                as we adore you,

06:37.800 --> 06:40.000
 and are happy that you've taken
  such an interest in Frederick,

06:40.100 --> 06:41.800
      we, we're just not getting

06:41.900 --> 06:43.900
             enough private time
                to ourselves.   

06:43.900 --> 06:45.600
 Oh, say no more. I understand. 
You guys want to be alone.      

06:45.700 --> 06:46.900
      Sure, tell you what.      

06:47.000 --> 06:48.800
  Why don't, uh, Freddie and I  
    go over to my apartment     

06:48.900 --> 06:50.500
      and you can catch up      
         with us later?         

06:50.500 --> 06:52.300
          No, no, Sam.          
    You misunderstand.          

06:52.300 --> 06:54.800
        We're not saying        
  that we want to be intimate   

06:54.900 --> 06:56.100
with each other right now.      

06:56.200 --> 06:59.000
 God forbid while the sun's up. 

07:03.100 --> 07:05.500
No, no, we're just saying       
that we'd like to spend the day 

07:05.600 --> 07:07.800
         with our son,          
     just the three of us.      

07:07.800 --> 07:09.300
              Oh.               

07:09.400 --> 07:10.300
          Well, shoot.          

07:10.400 --> 07:11.500
You should have told me sooner. 

07:11.600 --> 07:13.300
      I mean, I don't want      
         to, you know,          

07:13.400 --> 07:14.500
horn in                         
on you guys.                    

07:14.500 --> 07:15.500
    Tell you what, Freddie,     
        we're gonna have        

07:15.600 --> 07:16.800
    to watch cartoons           
  some other time, all right?   

07:16.900 --> 07:18.700
Why don't you now go over       
      to your daddy, huh?       

07:18.700 --> 07:21.400
There you go. Go to Daddy.      

07:23.700 --> 07:25.900
Go on, Freddie. It's okay.      

07:27.100 --> 07:29.500
Oh, fine. Now you see           
what you've done?               

07:29.500 --> 07:31.700
My son likes you better         
than he likes me.               

07:31.800 --> 07:33.800
      No, don't be silly.       

07:33.900 --> 07:35.400
     Come on, go to Daddy.      
        You'll have fun.        

07:35.500 --> 07:36.500
         He loves you.          

07:36.600 --> 07:38.300
Oh, now you're                  
being sarcastic.                

07:39.800 --> 07:40.900
I'm not being sarcastic.        

07:40.900 --> 07:42.000
Come on. Come on.               

07:42.100 --> 07:44.700
  Go to your daddy. Go on. Go.  

07:44.700 --> 07:47.000
         Okay, come on.         
  Go, go to your other daddy.   

07:47.100 --> 07:48.700
      Go to Uncle Frasier.      

07:48.800 --> 07:52.100
Sam, you have turned            
my son against me.              

07:52.200 --> 07:53.400
                         LILITH:
          If you two don't mind,

07:53.500 --> 07:55.000
            I think I'll take   
             our little wishbone

07:55.100 --> 07:56.600
                into the kitchen
                  for breakfast.

07:58.300 --> 08:01.300
         Oh, this is...         

08:01.400 --> 08:02.500
        Fras, I'm sorry.        

08:02.600 --> 08:03.400
Sam, he's my son.               

08:03.500 --> 08:05.200
I made him.                     
I get to keep him.              

08:07.700 --> 08:09.900
                  Come on, Fras.
                      Calm down.

08:09.900 --> 08:11.600
This is my house, my child      
          and my wife,          

08:11.600 --> 08:13.400
      who, thanks to you,       
     I don't even have time     

08:13.500 --> 08:15.000
to make love to in the morning. 

08:15.000 --> 08:16.000
     I thought you said...      

08:16.100 --> 08:17.200
     All right, I'm raving!     

08:23.800 --> 08:24.800
                I'm sorry.      

08:24.900 --> 08:26.600
                It's just, uh...
                I like your kid.

08:26.700 --> 08:28.100
                I didn't know   
            I liked kids before.

08:28.200 --> 08:29.400
If you like kids so much,       

08:29.400 --> 08:31.200
why don't you get               
one of your own.                

08:32.700 --> 08:34.000
Oh, Sam, Sam,                   
look, I'm sorry.                

08:34.100 --> 08:35.000
        Oh, that's all right.   

08:35.100 --> 08:36.500
You, you know                   
I love you, right?              

08:36.600 --> 08:38.900
I think you're one of the       
greatest guys in the world.     

08:39.000 --> 08:40.700
It's, it's just, it's           
just a little bit early         

08:40.799 --> 08:43.299
on a Saturday morning to, to    
lose the love of your child.    

08:45.500 --> 08:47.600
Now, if you...                  
you'd just excuse me            

08:47.700 --> 08:50.300
I, I think I'll go try          
to bond with my son             

08:50.300 --> 08:51.600
                     over a bowl
                 of Froot Loops.

08:51.600 --> 08:53.700
  Oh, God, I love Froot Loops.  

08:55.000 --> 08:56.100
         Sorry, sorry.          

09:06.300 --> 09:07.400
      Oh, hey, Miss Howe.       

09:07.500 --> 09:08.200
                         How was
                 your interview?

09:08.300 --> 09:10.100
      Did it go any better      
        than the others?        

09:10.100 --> 09:11.300
      Oh, yeah, the usual.      

09:11.400 --> 09:13.300
    You know, I was sitting     
      in the waiting room       

09:13.400 --> 09:15.900
    and got kind of nervous     
so I just had a quick cigarette.

09:16.000 --> 09:18.300
     You know, and that was     
    pretty much that.           

09:31.000 --> 09:32.800
      Think you could stop      
      throwing that thing?      

09:32.900 --> 09:34.200
 Why? Gives me something to do. 

09:39.900 --> 09:41.600
    We've got to talk.          

09:41.700 --> 09:43.100
      You know, ever since      
    I've been hanging around    

09:43.200 --> 09:44.400
 with Frasier and Lilith's kid, 
              I...              

09:44.500 --> 09:45.500
        (knocking)              

09:51.400 --> 09:54.400
 Sammy, uh, you don't expect me 
 to pay for this beer, do you?  

09:54.400 --> 09:56.200
              No.               

09:56.300 --> 09:58.100
             Good.              

10:06.000 --> 10:08.100
Come on, what's wrong?          

10:08.100 --> 10:11.200
     Do you think guys have     
      a biological clock?       

10:11.300 --> 10:14.100
    You know, like they know    
 when it's time to have a kid?  

10:14.100 --> 10:15.500
    Oh, yeah.                   

10:15.500 --> 10:16.700
     Usually when they say,     

10:16.800 --> 10:19.500
     "Hey, Carla, you want      
      to go out tonight?"       

10:19.500 --> 10:21.700
Come on. What's on your mind?   

10:21.800 --> 10:23.700
Well, I've been thinking.       

10:23.800 --> 10:26.200
You know, I'm, I'm not          
that young anymore.             

10:26.200 --> 10:29.300
It's not that I'm old.          
It's just... that I'm not young.

10:29.400 --> 10:30.400
    I'm not old-old.            

10:30.400 --> 10:31.800
    I'm just youngish.          

10:31.800 --> 10:34.500
         You know, I'm,         
      I'm a youngish man.       

10:34.500 --> 10:37.200
                Please go on.   

10:37.300 --> 10:40.700
  Well, I'm thinking about...   
  thinking about being a dad.   

10:40.700 --> 10:42.800
                     What?      

10:42.800 --> 10:44.600
        Yeah.                   

10:44.700 --> 10:46.600
You know, I've been playing     
around all my life              

10:46.700 --> 10:48.900
and, I don't know, you know,    
maybe I'm missing something.    

10:49.000 --> 10:51.000
                Have you thought
            about getting a dog?

10:51.200 --> 10:53.100
      I don't want a dog.       

10:53.200 --> 10:54.700
    You know, I want someone    
          to be with,           

10:54.800 --> 10:58.000
      to, to take care of,      
         to watch grow.         

10:58.000 --> 10:59.800
                Have you thought
          about getting a plant?

11:02.300 --> 11:04.100
        You don't think         
     I'll be a good father?     

11:04.100 --> 11:07.900
             Oh, no, no, I think
        you'd be a great father.

11:08.000 --> 11:09.900
            Do you have a mother
                     picked out?

11:09.900 --> 11:12.700
    No, not really.             

11:12.900 --> 11:14.200
                        Oh.     

11:14.300 --> 11:17.000
             Does that mean, uh,
     you're not going to ask me?

11:17.100 --> 11:18.000
    Well, I'm, I'm sorry.       

11:18.100 --> 11:19.600
    You know, I didn't          
         think of that.         

11:19.700 --> 11:20.700
      Yeah, would you?          

11:20.800 --> 11:22.100
             What are you, nuts?

11:24.700 --> 11:27.000
    Do you think I'm gonna go   
    through labor an eighth time

11:27.000 --> 11:28.400
                  because you're
                a little lonely?

11:30.500 --> 11:32.100
        Selfish bastard.        

11:33.800 --> 11:35.800
         Aw, you know,          
with me it doesn't matter.      

11:35.800 --> 11:37.900
         What the heck?         
    I know a hundred women.     

11:38.000 --> 11:39.900
          (chuckles):           
    What am I talking about?    

11:39.900 --> 11:41.600
I know thousands of women.      

11:41.600 --> 11:43.000
        What am I talking about?

11:43.100 --> 11:45.000
                  I know tens of
             thousands of women.

11:45.100 --> 11:46.700
    Wait, wait, wait.           
    What am I talking about?    

11:46.800 --> 11:47.400
             Sam...             

11:47.600 --> 11:48.900
come on, now,                   

11:49.000 --> 11:51.300
just think about this           
for a minute.                   

11:51.400 --> 11:53.900
Do you really, really want this?

11:54.000 --> 11:56.600
        Yeah, I really,         
    really want this.           

11:56.600 --> 11:58.300
         Come on, Sam.          

11:58.300 --> 12:01.600
      Do you have any idea      
  what it means to have a kid?  

12:03.000 --> 12:06.000
  It's changing dirty diapers   
and getting spit-up stains      

12:06.100 --> 12:08.700
    on those shoulders          
  of your best clothes, and...  

12:08.800 --> 12:11.000
and ear infections              
in the middle of the night,     

12:11.000 --> 12:13.700
    and shoving antibiotics     
      down their throats,       

12:13.700 --> 12:16.900
    and worrying about them     
every day and every night       

12:16.900 --> 12:18.900
for the rest of your life.      

12:19.000 --> 12:20.900
      How does <i>that</i> sound?      

12:22.000 --> 12:24.100
          Sounds cool.          

12:25.600 --> 12:27.000
          (chuckles):           
             Yeah.              

12:27.100 --> 12:28.700
        It is, kind of.         

12:32.300 --> 12:36.600
        Would they, like, really
     spit it up on, um, leather?

12:36.700 --> 12:38.900
          (chuckles):           
     Oh, they know fabrics.     

12:47.000 --> 12:49.100
So, who's gonna be              
the mom, Sam?                   

12:49.200 --> 12:51.000
            I haven't figured   
            that out yet, Woody,

12:51.100 --> 12:53.900
        but, you know, she's got
        to be somewhere in here.

12:54.000 --> 12:55.900
                        Or here.

12:57.400 --> 12:59.500
          (door opens)          

13:01.600 --> 13:02.900
Well, what about Miss Howe?     

13:03.000 --> 13:06.000
She's getting                   
up there like you.              

13:06.000 --> 13:08.000
She's probably about            
ready to have a kid.            

13:08.100 --> 13:09.700
And she's very responsible.     

13:09.800 --> 13:11.500
        I think that was        
     my best interview yet.     

13:11.600 --> 13:13.500
    I think that they really    
     were impressed with me     

13:13.600 --> 13:16.600
  until I accidentally knocked  
the CEO into a fax machine      

13:16.700 --> 13:20.400
  and sent a copy of his butt   
          to Wichita.           

13:20.400 --> 13:23.200
See, Sam, you could've          
asked her just now.             

13:25.300 --> 13:26.900
Oh, wait a minute.              
Here you go.                    

13:27.000 --> 13:28.000
Now, this could work out.       

13:28.000 --> 13:30.100
        What am I doing?        
      What am I gonna say?      

13:30.100 --> 13:32.100
      I have to figure out      
    how to word this.           

13:32.300 --> 13:33.400
            Hold on a second.   

13:33.400 --> 13:35.700
                Excuse me, miss?

13:35.800 --> 13:38.200
            Uh, can I ask you   
                     a question?
Sure.                           

13:38.300 --> 13:40.200
                 All right, just
            hypothetically, now,

13:40.200 --> 13:42.400
 say someone you've been dating,
        you know, a couple times

13:42.500 --> 13:46.100
        calls you up to say, uh,
            "Hey, we had some   
                laughs together.

13:46.100 --> 13:47.900
    What say we have a baby?"   

13:48.000 --> 13:50.200
            Now, I'm not talking
                commitment here;
         don't misunderstand me.

13:50.300 --> 13:51.800
            You know, maybe yes,
                    maybe no.   

13:51.900 --> 13:55.100
             The picture is: get
        pregnant, have the baby,

13:55.100 --> 13:57.600
         give it to me, go away.

13:57.700 --> 13:59.900
                        Uh...   

14:00.000 --> 14:02.700
         you know, just offhand,
    how would you react to that?

14:02.800 --> 14:05.100
    How would I react           
     if a guy called me up      

14:05.200 --> 14:07.600
          and asked me          
    to be a breeder for him?    

14:07.700 --> 14:11.100
To be sort of an incubator      
         for his seed?          

14:11.200 --> 14:13.300
                  Yeah, exactly.
                W-Wait a second.

14:13.400 --> 14:15.100
            Let me, uh... let   
                me get a pencil.

14:15.100 --> 14:17.400
                 I want to write
                      this down.

14:17.600 --> 14:18.500
                    Okay.       

14:23.400 --> 14:25.800
    Okay, "incubator."          

14:28.500 --> 14:31.000
        "Breeder."              

14:31.100 --> 14:33.500
        Red-flag words.         

14:35.300 --> 14:37.800
  You know, uh, if it's a boy,  

14:37.900 --> 14:41.400
    I just hope he names it     
    Clifford Clavin Malone.     

14:42.800 --> 14:44.100
 I don't care what he names it  

14:44.200 --> 14:45.800
     as long as he doesn't      
    bring it in here.           

14:45.800 --> 14:47.700
      If there's one thing      
  I can't stand, it's babies.   

14:47.800 --> 14:49.400
Oh, come on, Mr. Krapence.      

14:49.500 --> 14:51.300
Wouldn't you like               
a helpless little guy           

14:51.400 --> 14:55.000
all soft and cuddly             
who you could burp              
every once in a while?          

14:57.100 --> 15:00.100
             Yeah, we need      
         another one of those.  

15:02.100 --> 15:03.700
          (door opens)          

15:03.900 --> 15:05.400
         Sam.                   

15:07.300 --> 15:11.400
Listen, Sam, I... I'd like      
to apologize about this morning 

15:11.400 --> 15:13.400
     when I kicked you out.     

15:13.400 --> 15:15.200
I...                            

15:15.200 --> 15:17.100
    I forgot how much           
      Freddie means to you      

15:17.200 --> 15:19.000
 and how much you mean to him.  

15:20.500 --> 15:22.400
I also forgot that Lilith and I 
        have two tickets        

15:22.500 --> 15:24.300
  to <i>Jerome Robbins' Broadway</i>   
tonight-- hundred bucks a throw.

15:24.300 --> 15:26.300
     If you think I'm gonna     
    miss that, you're nuts.     

15:26.300 --> 15:29.100
Have fun, Freddie.              
Daddy loves you.                

15:34.200 --> 15:35.400
                Hey, you want me
                to lock up, Sam?

15:35.500 --> 15:38.800
No, thanks. I got to wait       
for Frasier and Lilith.         

15:38.800 --> 15:40.400
All right. Good night.          
                     Good night.

15:42.200 --> 15:44.400
    Hey, little buddy.          

15:44.500 --> 15:48.300
      So, what do you want      
    to watch there, Freddie?    

15:48.300 --> 15:50.300
     (music playing on TV)

16:20.900 --> 16:22.600
                Up-up here, Sam.
                 It's me, Elvis.

16:26.500 --> 16:28.000
      Elvis?                    

16:28.100 --> 16:29.100
                Yeah. Come on   
                 over here, man.

16:29.200 --> 16:30.800
            I don't want to have
                to shout at you.

16:34.300 --> 16:36.700
I'm having a dream about Elvis. 

16:38.800 --> 16:42.000
What do you want with me, Elvis?

16:44.700 --> 16:46.000
                  I want to tell
                  you something.

16:46.100 --> 16:47.400
              You're right about
                wanting a child.

16:47.500 --> 16:49.700
        You know, the best thing
        that ever happened to me

16:49.800 --> 16:51.500
          was having Lisa Marie.

16:51.600 --> 16:54.900
    Here. Isn't she precious?   

16:55.000 --> 16:56.500
Yeah, she's a real cutie.       

16:56.500 --> 16:58.500
     Well, you'll be happy      
        to know, Elvis,         

16:58.600 --> 17:01.000
         she turned out         
    to be a real babe.          

17:01.000 --> 17:04.000
              Sam, don't make me
        come through this TV.   

17:05.800 --> 17:07.599
        I'm sorry.              

17:07.700 --> 17:10.099
          Now, this baby's gonna
            need a mama, Sam.   

17:10.200 --> 17:12.400
    Yeah, I know that,          
        Elvis, but I...         

17:12.500 --> 17:14.800
I can't think of anybody.       

17:14.900 --> 17:16.800
              Well, I just think
     you're overlooking someone.

17:16.900 --> 17:17.800
              Who?              

17:17.800 --> 17:20.000
              Miss Rebecca Howe.

17:20.099 --> 17:21.599
            Rebecca?            

17:21.599 --> 17:23.200
                   <i>Miss</i> Rebecca.

17:24.900 --> 17:26.700
                      She's been
                  a true friend,

17:26.700 --> 17:28.900
             and-and you've been
    through so much together.   

17:29.000 --> 17:31.100
        There's a lot of love   
              in her heart, Sam.

17:31.200 --> 17:33.300
                  She has no one
                  to give it to.

17:33.400 --> 17:35.100
                     And she's a
                 handsome woman.

17:35.200 --> 17:37.300
     Miss Rebecca? Really?      

17:38.600 --> 17:40.500
        Think about her, Sam.   
            I know I'm right.   

17:40.600 --> 17:42.400
                  Now, if you'll
            just excuse me, man.

17:42.400 --> 17:44.800
            I got to go back and
              frolic on a beach,

17:44.900 --> 17:46.700
  or jump in a stock car race   
         or something.          

17:46.800 --> 17:49.800
     I don't know what they     
got me doing in this one.       

17:49.900 --> 17:51.600
          Later, Sam.           

17:58.300 --> 17:59.900
    Isn't this sweet?           

18:00.000 --> 18:03.700
My son and his baby-sitter      
      passed out in a bar.

    (Frederick fusses)          

18:08.400 --> 18:10.900
        No, it's okay... Ooh!   
    Sam. Sam.                   

18:13.300 --> 18:14.200
I've got him, Sam.              

18:14.300 --> 18:15.500
                        Fras.   
      Thanks.                   

18:15.600 --> 18:16.700
                         Yeah.  

18:20.400 --> 18:22.500
            Say... Frasier.     

18:22.600 --> 18:24.500
                Whew!           

18:24.500 --> 18:27.300
         Weirdest thing         
      just happened to me.      

18:27.400 --> 18:30.300
 I could have sworn I just, uh, 

18:30.300 --> 18:33.300
    just had a conversation     
      with Elvis Presley.       

18:33.300 --> 18:36.400
        Well, Sam, I've had, uh,
        four or five patients   

18:36.400 --> 18:38.100
            that have had the   
                same experience.

18:38.200 --> 18:41.200
     I'll simply... simply      
tell you what I told them.      

18:41.200 --> 18:43.000
        The man is dead.        

18:57.500 --> 18:59.300
            Hi, Sam.            

18:59.300 --> 19:02.500
      Hi. Wh-What are you       
        doing back here?        

19:02.600 --> 19:04.400
      My night to lock up.      

19:04.500 --> 19:06.000
     Besides, it looks like     

19:06.100 --> 19:08.500
    I'm still gonna be          
      working here anyway.      

19:08.600 --> 19:09.700
Nobody else wants me.           

19:09.800 --> 19:11.200
                Oh, I'm sorry   
                to hear that.   

19:11.300 --> 19:12.700
Yeah, well, you know,           

19:12.800 --> 19:15.900
maybe I've been barking up      
the wrong tree my whole life.   

19:16.000 --> 19:20.500
All these big dreams about      
being a big corporate executive 

19:20.500 --> 19:23.600
and, you know, having           
a lot of power...               

19:23.700 --> 19:25.700
 a lot of control.              

19:25.800 --> 19:29.900
I don't know why I've been      
knocking my brains out.         

19:30.000 --> 19:31.100
Maybe I should have             
just settled                    

19:31.200 --> 19:34.900
for some dumb, ordinary jerk,   
you know, and raised a family.  

19:35.000 --> 19:36.700
                    Wow.        

19:44.500 --> 19:46.400
What?                           

19:46.500 --> 19:49.200
          I was just, uh... I...

19:49.200 --> 19:51.200
             you know, I've been
        thinking the same thing.

19:51.200 --> 19:54.400
  Only, you know, I was thinking
    that you should have a child

19:54.500 --> 19:57.100
        with someone who is, you
    know, good-looking and...   

19:57.100 --> 19:59.400
              and really cool.  

19:59.400 --> 20:02.700
Yeah, well, I don't know        
anybody like that.              

20:02.800 --> 20:04.700
                  What about me?

20:04.800 --> 20:06.600
What, you know                  
somebody like that?             

20:06.700 --> 20:09.000
              No, you know, I...

20:09.100 --> 20:11.500
            what I mean is, I   
            was thinking that...

20:11.500 --> 20:14.400
        you and I should have   
                a baby together.

20:14.500 --> 20:16.400
     (laughs)                   

20:16.500 --> 20:18.700
Oh, come on, Sam!               
                         What?  

20:18.800 --> 20:20.000
            No, why? Why not?   

20:20.100 --> 20:21.400
    I mean, think about it.     

20:21.400 --> 20:23.000
You and I                       
are good friends--              

20:23.000 --> 20:24.300
hell, you're                    
my best friend--                

20:24.300 --> 20:26.000
and we've been through          
a lot together,                 

20:26.100 --> 20:29.100
and, you know, you... you       
have a lot of love to give,     

20:29.200 --> 20:30.600
and you're                      
a handsome woman.               

20:35.000 --> 20:37.400
          Well, I-I'm flattered.

20:37.500 --> 20:40.600
But I'm just... I'm not ready   
  to have a baby, Sam, you know?

20:40.700 --> 20:43.700
        I got a lot of things   
          left to do in my life.

20:43.700 --> 20:45.600
Yeah? Like what?                
                Like a <i>lot.</i>     

20:45.700 --> 20:47.000
Well, all right, name one.      

20:47.100 --> 20:49.900
         Well, like I had always
          planned on growing old

20:49.900 --> 20:51.800
                  and, you know,
                    dying alone.

20:53.200 --> 20:55.200
     You can still do that.     

20:55.300 --> 20:57.200
Well, you don't just, you know, 

20:57.300 --> 21:00.100
     go out and have a baby     
         with somebody.         

21:00.100 --> 21:01.800
            Why not?            

21:01.900 --> 21:03.400
  Well, I don't know why not.   

21:03.500 --> 21:04.700
         Then why not?          

21:04.800 --> 21:05.900
    And why with you?           

21:06.000 --> 21:07.200
             Why not?           

21:07.300 --> 21:09.100
         Well, but...           

21:11.700 --> 21:13.300
          Why not?              

21:13.400 --> 21:15.100
      I mean, we could.         

21:15.200 --> 21:16.500
                        Yeah.   

21:16.500 --> 21:18.300
And <i>your</i> mom did it.            
     <i>My</i> mom did...              

21:18.400 --> 21:21.100
  I mean, Carla does it         
      all the time.             

21:23.700 --> 21:25.900
I mean, I... why shouldn't <i>we?</i>  

21:26.000 --> 21:28.900
    I mean, and, you know,      
maybe this would be something   

21:28.900 --> 21:30.900
that I'd finally be good at.    

21:32.000 --> 21:34.700
                So, will you?   

21:35.800 --> 21:37.100
      'Kay.                     

21:39.900 --> 21:42.100
Let's have a baby.              

21:50.000 --> 21:52.800
You know, I think this is       
gonna change my whole life.     

21:52.900 --> 21:53.800
                    Oh, yeah.   

21:53.900 --> 21:57.000
        I think, no more        
    Rebecca the jerk,           

21:57.100 --> 22:01.100
 no more Rebecca the goonball,  
    Rebecca the loser.          

22:01.200 --> 22:02.600
      Rebecca the mother!       

22:02.600 --> 22:05.600
         I'm gonna have         
    a brand-new human baby!     

22:07.300 --> 22:09.400
    I get to feed her.          
    I get to hold her!          

22:09.400 --> 22:10.700
Oh!                             

22:10.700 --> 22:12.400
         I can't wait!          

22:12.500 --> 22:14.600
     You know, a new life!      

22:14.600 --> 22:18.400
    A new life that depends     
    completely on me!           

22:18.500 --> 22:20.900
          (clattering)          

22:27.200 --> 22:29.500
    Do you believe it?          
    I forgot my coat!           

22:29.500 --> 22:32.700
            (gasps):            
  I guess I'm just so excited   
    about this whole thing!     

22:32.800 --> 22:35.600
         I don't know.          
     I'm gonna be a mommy!      

22:35.700 --> 22:37.600
          (giggling)            

22:37.700 --> 22:41.300
     (coatrack clattering)      
          Oh, a mommy!          

22:44.800 --> 22:47.200
 You'd better be right, Elvis.
