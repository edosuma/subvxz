William Bell

00:10.447 --> 00:12.072
I've been waiting
for this.

00:12.107 --> 00:13.061
Who are you?

00:13.096 --> 00:15.394
- I'm William Bell.
- Where am I?

00:17.510 --> 00:20.320
<i>You were missing from your car</i>
<i>for at least an hour</i>

00:20.355 --> 00:22.358
before you came crashing back
through the windshield.

00:22.393 --> 00:23.337
He told me something.

00:23.372 --> 00:23.670
Who?

00:23.711 --> 00:24.560
<i>I don't know,</i>
<i>I can't remember.</i>

00:24.600 --> 00:25.974
But it was
very important.

00:26.009 --> 00:27.396
There's something
that I have to do.

Hey, I was wondering
if I could get some directions.

01:44.549 --> 01:46.485
What are you doing here?
You're trespassing, pal.

01:46.520 --> 01:48.184
<i>Why don't you get in your car</i>
<i>and turn around?</i>

01:48.219 --> 01:49.529
Yeah, sure.

Oh, my God!

03:25.758 --> 03:27.651
- Agent Dunham.
- Walter, hey.

03:27.686 --> 03:29.551
So, you said you
wanted to see me.

03:29.586 --> 03:31.175
Oh, I had an idea.

03:31.184 --> 03:34.028
I think I may be able
to help you retrieve

03:34.063 --> 03:34.859
your memories

03:34.894 --> 03:37.084
from the accident,
when you disappeared

03:37.119 --> 03:38.572

in New York.

03:38.607 --> 03:40.128
I-I remember that bit.

03:40.163 --> 03:40.996
Of course you do.

03:41.067 --> 03:43.515
Walter, I thought that we agreed
that this was a stupid idea.

03:43.550 --> 03:44.685
- [blender whirring]
- No, <i>you</i> decided.

03:44.720 --> 03:45.699
I still maintain

03:45.760 --> 03:47.485
that the principle
is perfectly sound.

03:47.520 --> 03:49.518
He wants you
to eat worms.

03:49.553 --> 03:51.575
WALTER:
<i>Not just worms, flatworms!</i>

03:53.585 --> 03:54.657
The thing is,
Agent Dunham,

03:54.751 --> 03:57.160
I recalled an experiment
that Belly and I did

03:57.318 --> 04:00.051
w-where we trained
a handful of flatworms

04:00.086 --> 04:01.473
to respond to light.

04:01.508 --> 04:03.931
We then crushed them up
and fed them to other worms.

04:03.966 --> 04:05.461
<i>It was Belly's idea.</i>

04:05.496 --> 04:07.308
Because who wouldn't think
to do that?

04:08.787 --> 04:09.636
The point is

04:09.671 --> 04:12.860
that these other worms,
without having been trained,

04:12.895 --> 04:15.191
began to respond
to light.

04:15.226 --> 04:18.184
It seems the first worms
transferred their memories

04:18.219 --> 04:20.583
to the other worms
through ingestion.

04:20.618 --> 04:22.418
Right, but that still
has nothing to do

04:22.453 --> 04:23.852
with stimulating
Agent Dunham's memory.

04:23.887 --> 04:26.051
How will we know
unless we try?

04:26.086 --> 04:28.153
<i>That's why it's called</i>
<i>an experiment, Peter.</i>

04:28.188 --> 04:29.263
PETER: <i>Thanks. I know</i>
<i>what an experiment is.</i>

04:29.298 --> 04:30.857
- <i>Uh, guys?</i>

04:30.907 --> 04:31.792

04:55.537 --> 04:57.068
This is what
we know so far.

04:57.685 --> 05:00.462
Facility manager arrived
to work this morning at 6:30,

05:00.551 --> 05:02.702
saw the bodies and called it in
to the local P.D.

05:02.737 --> 05:04.591
So the robbery took place
in the middle of the night.

05:04.984 --> 05:07.260
<i>That makes three cryogenic</i>
<i>facilities in a week,</i>

05:07.351 --> 05:09.177
<i>same M.O.</i>
<i>as Chicago and New York.</i>

05:09.184 --> 05:11.184
Yeah, but chicago
was a straight "B" and "E."

05:11.219 --> 05:13.315
But in all three cases,
the target was the same.

05:13.350 --> 05:14.432
Frozen heads.

05:14.952 --> 05:17.341
Which does bring up
several obvious questions--

05:17.376 --> 05:18.926
First of which,
what the hell for?

05:18.961 --> 05:20.740
Police recovered
ten shell casings

05:20.775 --> 05:21.894
from a nine millimeter.

05:21.918 --> 05:24.627
Looks like a single perp
rolled up and dropped four men,

05:24.662 --> 05:25.594
two of whom were armed.

05:25.629 --> 05:26.346
Excuse me.

05:26.884 --> 05:29.403
Can I see the body
that's bleeding silver now?

05:39.818 --> 05:41.166
WALTER:
Fascinating.

05:41.509 --> 05:42.163
Walter.

05:43.017 --> 05:44.060
Perfect, son.

05:47.184 --> 05:49.384
<i>It has the consistency</i>
<i>of mercury.</i>

05:51.218 --> 05:53.051
OLIVIA: <i>These robberies</i>
<i>are obviously connected.</i>

05:53.086 --> 05:55.180
We should pull the files
on New York and Chicago.

05:55.318 --> 05:57.318
BROYLES: <i>I'll make some calls,</i>
<i>tell the local agents</i>

05:57.353 --> 05:59.215
that we're taking
over the investigations.

05:59.250 --> 06:00.145
Yes, sir.

06:06.718 --> 06:07.952
[man speaking backwards]

06:13.242 --> 06:14.074
You okay?

06:14.084 --> 06:16.521
Uh, yeah. So, um,
what does Walter think?

06:16.556 --> 06:17.751
Meet Mr. Silver-Blood.

06:18.191 --> 06:19.885
Walter thinks
it's actually mercury.

06:20.478 --> 06:21.351
Mercury?

06:30.117 --> 06:32.556
Agent Francis, hello.

06:33.034 --> 06:33.634
Hey.

06:33.852 --> 06:35.628
You all right?
You look pale.

06:35.685 --> 06:38.418
Yeah. I didn't get
much sleep last night.

06:38.451 --> 06:40.817
Oh. I may be able
to help you with that.

06:41.485 --> 06:45.059
A little cannabis before bedtime
does wonders, huh?

06:46.451 --> 06:48.578
[laughs]

06:54.051 --> 06:56.093
I recognize this.

06:58.785 --> 07:01.815
<i>This is the device</i>
<i>the shape-shifter used.</i>

07:02.952 --> 07:05.056
[electric razor whirring]

07:17.385 --> 07:19.724
[breathing heavily]

07:21.852 --> 07:23.017
You look like hell.

07:25.384 --> 07:27.201
That was, uh...

07:27.451 --> 07:29.542
That was sloppy.

07:30.393 --> 07:32.267
You killed four men
last night,

07:32.818 --> 07:34.958
including one
of our own.

07:35.451 --> 07:37.131
There's nothing
to link him to us.

07:37.251 --> 07:40.091
Maybe not,
but now the FBI--

07:40.518 --> 07:42.209
They have him.

07:42.451 --> 07:46.964
They understand
what he is.

07:47.837 --> 07:49.493
You've been
in this body too long.

07:50.518 --> 07:51.822
You're dying.

07:52.818 --> 07:53.884
You need
to get back home

07:53.919 --> 07:55.925
and get fitted
with a new conversion device.

07:57.068 --> 07:58.451
<i>I'd let you use mine...</i>

07:58.952 --> 08:00.421
<i>but what would be</i>
<i>the point?</i>

08:00.451 --> 08:01.258
Yeah.

08:01.293 --> 08:03.069
It wouldn't do
anything anyway.

08:03.150 --> 08:04.363
[razor whirring]

08:04.486 --> 08:05.785
You've asked
for extraction.

08:05.820 --> 08:09.869
They say not until
the mission is done.

08:10.184 --> 08:11.875
They're real sweethearts.

08:12.361 --> 08:14.459
Damn.
That's the last one.

08:14.842 --> 08:15.713
He's not here.

08:16.887 --> 08:18.852
There's another facility
in North Carolina.

08:23.084 --> 08:24.652
I have another idea.

08:25.067 --> 08:28.415
Olivia Dunham is starting
to remember her time

08:28.450 --> 08:29.970
on the other side.

08:30.570 --> 08:34.303
I'm thinking she may know
where it's hidden.

08:35.263 --> 08:35.892
His head?

08:36.010 --> 08:37.056
Yeah.

08:38.801 --> 08:39.770
What makes you
think that?

08:40.631 --> 08:43.815
If Bell knows that
we're looking for it,

08:44.318 --> 08:46.856
it seemed
like a likely reason

08:47.246 --> 08:49.952
why he'd bring her
over to the other side.

08:49.987 --> 08:51.276
Well, if you're right,

08:51.518 --> 08:53.663
and you don't want that
body to be your last,

08:54.748 --> 08:56.651
then I suggest you do
whatever it takes

08:56.686 --> 08:57.906
to make her remember.

09:10.770 --> 09:12.040
BROYLES: Why?

09:12.404 --> 09:13.295
OLIVIA:
<i>Why...</i>

09:13.929 --> 09:15.541
Why are
shape-shifting soldiers

09:15.576 --> 09:17.889
from another universe
stealing frozen heads?

09:18.710 --> 09:21.297
The most likely explanation
that we can think of

09:21.332 --> 09:23.765
is that they're looking
for a specific head,

09:23.800 --> 09:24.808
but they don't know
where it is.

09:24.843 --> 09:26.590
Okay. Then who?

09:26.625 --> 09:27.275
We don't know.

09:27.310 --> 09:30.014
These facilities
pride themselves on secrecy.

09:30.409 --> 09:31.908
So despite the thefts,

09:31.943 --> 09:34.498
none of them have been willing
to give up their client lists.

09:35.120 --> 09:36.342
What about
the other device,

09:36.377 --> 09:37.988
the one we found
a few weeks ago?

09:38.008 --> 09:40.208
Did it give any indication
who these people are?

09:40.243 --> 09:42.295
Unfortunately,
the other device is broken.

09:42.908 --> 09:44.978
We asked Massive Dynamic to see
what they could make of it,

09:45.013 --> 09:46.243
but apparently
they've been stumped.

09:46.705 --> 09:48.287
Well, this one
doesn't appear to be damaged.

09:48.607 --> 09:51.095
So maybe Peter
can figure something out.

09:51.130 --> 09:52.620
I suppose
he knows a guy?

09:52.708 --> 09:54.103
He knew enough
about engineering

09:54.138 --> 09:55.670
to fake his way
into M.I.T.

09:55.705 --> 09:57.248
Well, let me know
if you learn anything.

09:57.941 --> 09:59.062
In the meantime,

09:59.708 --> 10:02.071
I'm considering giving you
a protective detail.

10:02.392 --> 10:03.834
A protective detail?
Why?

10:03.869 --> 10:06.445
<i>The last time Peter showed me</i>
<i>one of these devices,</i>

10:06.808 --> 10:08.763
its owner had just tried
to kill you.

10:10.079 --> 10:11.081
I'm not worried,

10:11.641 --> 10:13.459
'cause that was
six weeks ago.

10:13.992 --> 10:16.861
So if a shape-shifting assassin
wanted me dead...

10:17.975 --> 10:19.393
then I would be.

10:24.108 --> 10:26.461
WALTER: Let's see how
this thing operates.

10:27.165 --> 10:28.413
What are you saying,

10:28.448 --> 10:30.942
this is not a person?

10:31.603 --> 10:33.226
My dear,
I'm not certain

10:33.261 --> 10:35.695
that you're not simply
a figment of my imagination.

10:36.342 --> 10:39.081
No, this is
certainly not human,

10:39.601 --> 10:42.658
rather a highly advanced
technology--

10:43.141 --> 10:45.771
A mechano/organic hybrid.

10:46.333 --> 10:49.930
I suspect that they produce
or possibly ingest the mercury

10:50.508 --> 10:52.003
and that it controls
the tissue,

10:52.053 --> 10:55.173
instructing it to take
and maintain shapes.

10:57.013 --> 10:57.826
What?

10:58.041 --> 11:00.058
We have to call
Agent Dunham.

11:00.680 --> 11:02.179
I need to talk to her
right away.

11:02.214 --> 11:02.956
Okay.

11:12.808 --> 11:14.247
PETER: You know what this
reminds me of?

11:14.411 --> 11:16.947
Did you ever see that movie
<i>Invasion of the Body Snatchers?</i>

11:17.507 --> 11:18.507
Which version--

11:18.542 --> 11:20.375
Don Siegel
or Philip Kaufman?

11:23.899 --> 11:24.842
[laughs]

11:25.288 --> 11:26.132
The remake.

11:26.937 --> 11:28.132
I remember
when I saw that movie,

11:28.167 --> 11:29.862
I was so scared,
I didn't sleep for a week.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.507
<i>I was convinced</i>
<i>that if I fell asleep,</i>

11:31.542 --> 11:33.274
<i>I was gonna be replaced</i>
<i>by a pod person.</i>

11:33.309 --> 11:35.311
Is this your way of trying
to ask me if I'm scared?

11:37.881 --> 11:39.246
No, of course not.

11:39.774 --> 11:41.308
I mean, I figure
if you were scared,

11:41.343 --> 11:42.311
you'd tell me, right?

11:43.676 --> 11:46.661
Besides, I figure
between the two of us,

11:46.696 --> 11:48.002
you're the one
that carries the gun.

11:49.708 --> 11:51.727
[static]

11:53.854 --> 11:54.909
What the hell?

11:54.944 --> 11:57.037
- What is it?
- I'm not sure.

11:57.072 --> 11:58.478
I was just trying

11:58.774 --> 11:59.745
[high-pitched whine]

11:59.843 --> 12:01.388
Looks like this thing
is streaming data...

12:02.051 --> 12:03.180
and lots of it.

12:04.608 --> 12:06.189
[cell phone rings]

12:12.209 --> 12:14.385
I've got good news
and bad news.

12:14.420 --> 12:16.697
The bad news is that
the shape-shifter's blood

12:16.732 --> 12:18.799
is 47% mercury.

12:19.361 --> 12:20.199
Which means?

12:20.234 --> 12:21.226
Well, I'm not sure,

12:21.664 --> 12:25.066
but I went back and re-examined
the autopsy reports

12:25.101 --> 12:26.472
for the first shape-shifter.

12:26.507 --> 12:27.507
- And?
- And...

12:28.372 --> 12:31.208
her blood sample
is perfectly normal--

12:31.243 --> 12:34.214
Just traces of mercury,
which would suggest that,

12:34.249 --> 12:36.321
despite what we thought
back then--

12:36.381 --> 12:38.099
She wasn't
a shape-shifter at all.

12:38.442 --> 12:39.422
I'm afraid so.

12:39.541 --> 12:41.259
So the shape-shifter
is still alive,

12:41.474 --> 12:42.642
which means by now,

12:42.708 --> 12:44.507
it could be disguised
as anyone.

12:44.542 --> 12:46.261
And you could
still be in danger.

12:49.941 --> 12:51.837
Would you like to hear
the good news now?

12:52.521 --> 12:55.137

how to find him.

Oh, from somewhere else.

REBECCA: <i>He's glowing, man.</i>

13:19.208 --> 13:21.509
If she was able to identify
the shape-shifter once,

13:21.544 --> 13:22.924
she may be able
to do it again.

He's from

13:36.274 --> 13:37.862
Hey, looks like
we may have some leads

13:37.908 --> 13:39.833
on how to identify
the shape-shifters.

13:39.868 --> 13:40.996
<i>Walter has an idea,</i>

13:41.031 --> 13:42.848

<i>But in the meantime,</i>

13:43.781 --> 13:44.994
can you check in
with Broyles,

13:44.995 --> 13:46.987
see if there's something new
from the crime scenes?

13:47.583 --> 13:48.521
Sure thing.

15:05.225 --> 15:07.638
and he also believes
it's possible

15:07.791 --> 15:09.796
that these devices
store a pattern

15:09.797 --> 15:11.072
of their last victim.

15:11.362 --> 15:13.018
Our scientists
have the same theory.

15:13.596 --> 15:15.200
In fact, they thought
they might be able

15:15.251 --> 15:16.520
to extract an image.

15:16.521 --> 15:18.091
They also theorize
that each device

15:18.126 --> 15:19.576
is tuned
to a specific user,

15:19.829 --> 15:22.759
which suggests that
since the shape-changer

15:22.794 --> 15:23.997
that tried to kill you

15:24.362 --> 15:25.779
no longer
has his device,

15:25.858 --> 15:27.558
he's trapped
in his current body.

15:27.696 --> 15:29.494
Our scientists
have been working on revealing

15:29.564 --> 15:31.154
that shape-shifter's
identity,

15:31.775 --> 15:33.765
but what with all the damage
to the other unit--

15:33.885 --> 15:35.190
Well, this one is intact.

15:36.002 --> 15:37.909
Then let's take a look,
shall we?

15:39.729 --> 15:41.041
OLIVIA:
<i>So can you fix it?</i>

15:41.236 --> 15:42.698
Do you understand
you're asking me

15:42.777 --> 15:44.827
if I can repair
a piece of technology

15:44.828 --> 15:46.534
that is entirely
unlike anything

15:46.569 --> 15:49.925

here on Earth?

15:50.233 --> 15:50.974

15:51.034 --> 15:52.470

I have one that works,

15:52.651 --> 15:55.400
I can do it
in three hours... tops.

15:55.530 --> 15:57.378
Good, then get started
right away.

15:57.413 --> 15:57.849
Yeah.

15:58.133 --> 15:59.434
Okay, I'm gonna head
back to Boston.

15:59.469 --> 16:00.935
Will you call me

16:00.970 --> 16:02.334
Oh, I can do
better than that.

16:02.369 --> 16:04.059
I can set up
a rendering program

16:04.200 --> 16:05.509
and patch you in...

16:06.068 --> 16:06.966

16:07.467 --> 16:10.025
If you want, you can see it
all for yourself.

16:10.060 --> 16:11.660
From a computer,
from your cell phone,

16:11.901 --> 16:13.200
I can log you

16:22.233 --> 16:23.380
Yes, it's lovely.

16:23.760 --> 16:26.081
Rebecca always had
fine taste.

16:27.193 --> 16:28.954
Do you think
she'll remember me?

16:29.200 --> 16:31.517
[chuckles]
I think she might.

16:31.701 --> 16:33.567
I'm gonna guess there's
not too many men in her life

16:33.602 --> 16:34.670
who have strapped her
to a table

16:34.734 --> 16:36.747
and pumped her full of a massive
amount of psychedelics.

16:44.701 --> 16:45.819
Walter, you didn't--

16:46.133 --> 16:47.037

Is it you?

17:08.519 --> 17:09.409
Hello, Rebecca.

17:10.800 --> 17:11.862
Oh, my God.

17:14.434 --> 17:15.387
Hello.

17:17.500 --> 17:18.211
Hi.

17:18.534 --> 17:19.679
Walter.

17:25.689 --> 17:27.574
At first,
I assumed it was all

17:27.666 --> 17:30.177
just a figment
of my imagination

17:30.367 --> 17:32.605
and the LSD, of course.

17:32.640 --> 17:34.135
But after a while,

17:34.170 --> 17:36.583
it wasn't just
during the experiments.

17:38.031 --> 17:42.247
I would see their faces
in front of me.

17:42.807 --> 17:45.817
They seemed to have,
I don't know,

17:45.968 --> 17:48.861
a certain glow
about them.

17:49.100 --> 17:50.226

17:50.667 --> 17:51.963
Mm-hmm.

17:52.068 --> 17:56.425
It--it took me a year or two
to really understand it.

17:57.034 --> 17:58.792
But I realized that...

17:59.716 --> 18:02.134
I was recognizing
people that...

18:03.114 --> 18:05.355
didn't belong.

18:05.867 --> 18:08.748
You know,
like that children's song--

18:09.434 --> 18:12.104

18:17.500 --> 18:18.467
Yes, that's it.

18:18.502 --> 18:20.667

triggered an ability

18:20.702 --> 18:22.665
to see beyond the limits
of your vision.

18:25.001 --> 18:28.564
You gave me
a great gift, Walter.

18:29.758 --> 18:31.390
You, uh...

18:32.294 --> 18:34.303
opened my mind
for a time.

18:37.068 --> 18:39.068
In fact, I even tried
to look you up

18:39.103 --> 18:40.343
about ten years ago,

18:41.658 --> 18:43.399
tried to contact Harvard,

18:43.434 --> 18:46.739
but no one knew where you were
or how to reach you.

18:46.774 --> 18:47.500
I was--

18:47.535 --> 18:48.425
traveling.

18:49.200 --> 18:50.752
My father
was traveling.

18:50.787 --> 18:53.855
<i>Ms. Kibner,</i>
<i>you said "for a time."</i>

18:53.890 --> 18:55.534
Does that mean
that the ability has faded?

18:55.569 --> 18:57.116
Not entirely, no.

18:57.151 --> 18:59.195
Comes and goes
as it pleases.

18:59.230 --> 19:02.213

that some of them
are amongst us right now.

19:07.669 --> 19:09.420
We were hoping
that you might be able

19:09.470 --> 19:10.906
to help us identify them.

it's--it's mostly gone.

19:14.369 --> 19:16.171

could get it back--

Your ability?

19:18.775 --> 19:20.701
You mean
do the experiment again?

against.

22:11.610 --> 22:13.436
we can reduce it

Listen to my voice.

23:35.001 --> 23:37.499
I'm going to take you
over the threshold.

23:37.534 --> 23:39.892
<i>We're walking</i>
<i>through Johnston Gate</i>

23:39.927 --> 23:41.377
<i>into Harvard Yard.</i>

23:41.593 --> 23:42.326
Can you see it?

23:42.361 --> 23:44.075
It's autumn,
and it's late.

23:44.334 --> 23:46.352
<i>The leaves crunch</i>
<i>under our feet.</i>

23:46.467 --> 23:48.643
<i>Past the statue</i>
<i>of John Harvard.</i>

23:49.601 --> 23:51.994
[breathing heavily]

23:52.434 --> 23:55.267
WALTER: <i>Now we're passing</i>
<i>University Hall,</i>

23:55.268 --> 23:57.214
<i>Memorial Church</i>
<i>is up ahead.</i>

23:58.268 --> 23:59.374
[groans]

23:59.555 --> 24:00.338
Ring.

24:01.267 --> 24:02.161
[bell dings]

24:06.034 --> 24:07.869
Walter!
Hey, Walter.

24:08.246 --> 24:08.939
Olivia.

24:08.974 --> 24:10.200
Olivia! Olivia!

24:14.934 --> 24:16.444
BELL: <i>Olivia.</i>

24:18.834 --> 24:21.060
<i>After</i>
<i>all these years...</i>

24:22.396 --> 24:25.738
<i>it is so nice</i>
<i>to finally see you again.</i>

24:37.118 --> 24:38.420
BELL:
<i>You'll have to forgive me.</i>

24:39.013 --> 24:41.109
The method by which I brought
you over here was crude,

24:41.190 --> 24:42.560
and I'm sorry for that,

24:43.111 --> 24:45.438
but there were people who were
trying to prevent our meeting.

24:46.594 --> 24:49.478
This is not at all
the kind of reunion

24:49.513 --> 24:50.651
I'd always envisioned.

24:52.032 --> 24:53.806
The reunion that
<i>you</i> had envisioned?

24:54.526 --> 24:56.325
Dr. Bell, I have been
trying to meet with you

24:56.365 --> 24:57.505
for over a year.

25:00.396 --> 25:01.961
Please,
call me William...

25:03.530 --> 25:07.380
or "Willam" if that
feels warmer to you.

25:07.415 --> 25:10.400
Willam--that's what
you always called me

25:10.435 --> 25:11.466
when you were a girl.

25:14.662 --> 25:16.101
How do you
like your tea?

25:17.538 --> 25:19.375
I don't want any tea.
I want answers.

25:19.772 --> 25:20.329
[rumbling]

25:23.629 --> 25:26.844
[laughs] You're still
a little disoriented

25:26.879 --> 25:28.299
from the time slips,
aren't you?

25:31.188 --> 25:32.843
Happened to me
when I first came here.

25:33.363 --> 25:35.844
You're--you're out of sync
with this side.

25:36.163 --> 25:39.527
You're lucky. Most people
who cross dimensions

25:39.977 --> 25:42.187
without
your natural talent

25:42.396 --> 25:44.063
are simply torn apart.

25:45.458 --> 25:47.731
Well, "lucky" isn't the word
that I would choose.

25:47.762 --> 25:50.091
[rumbling]

25:50.092 --> 25:51.398
[gas hissing]

25:53.595 --> 25:55.632
[breathing deeply]

26:06.229 --> 26:08.111
Ahh.

26:10.729 --> 26:13.395
I don't know how much
Walter's told you by now.

26:14.595 --> 26:17.119
I don't know
how much he remembers.

26:17.595 --> 26:19.396
He told me
what you two did to me

26:19.431 --> 26:20.832
when I was just a girl...

26:23.196 --> 26:25.869
How you conducted drug trials
on young children.

26:29.329 --> 26:31.218
We weren't trying
to hurt you, Olivia.

26:31.762 --> 26:34.016
We weren't trying
to hurt anybody.

26:35.762 --> 26:37.729
Hey, guess what?

26:37.896 --> 26:39.691
[chuckles]
You did.

26:43.496 --> 26:45.405
I've met some
of the others.

26:46.488 --> 26:48.794
To say that they are
permanently damaged

26:48.829 --> 26:50.309
would be
an understatement.

26:52.496 --> 26:53.627
Yes.

26:55.430 --> 26:57.329
In any search
for knowledge,

26:57.364 --> 26:59.904
there are always
unintended consequences--

27:01.159 --> 27:02.695
Victims, you might say.

27:04.221 --> 27:05.141
But not you.

27:05.690 --> 27:06.924
I can see that...

27:07.762 --> 27:09.383
just by looking at you.

27:10.579 --> 27:13.606
In fact, you're just coming
into your ability.

27:13.996 --> 27:15.363
[rumbling]

27:15.819 --> 27:18.201
<i>[echoing] I've seen history</i>
<i>repeat itself</i>

27:18.236 --> 27:19.474
<i>enough times to know</i>

27:19.509 --> 27:21.067
a war is coming,

27:21.196 --> 27:24.396
just as we predicted,
Walter and I, years ago,

27:24.431 --> 27:27.708
and we knew that
we had to prepare a guardian,

27:27.929 --> 27:29.530
someone to watch
the gate.

27:30.351 --> 27:31.067
The gate?

27:31.922 --> 27:34.280
Between
this side and yours.

27:34.715 --> 27:35.996
I would like
to say "ours,"

27:36.031 --> 27:37.741
because that's
where I came from,

27:38.063 --> 27:39.962
but I'm afraid
I would sound disingenuous.

27:41.131 --> 27:42.065
Go on.

27:42.669 --> 27:44.856
For reasons that will
become clear in time,

27:45.396 --> 27:48.189
I cannot go back yet,
maybe not ever.

27:48.829 --> 27:51.096
But now we know how difficult
it is to cross over.

27:51.131 --> 27:52.550
I can count
on my hand

27:52.940 --> 27:54.841
the number of people
who've done it safely.

27:55.448 --> 27:56.905
<i>But on this side,</i>

27:57.063 --> 27:58.905
they've become
more insidious.

27:59.508 --> 28:01.675
They have
designed hybrids--

28:02.229 --> 28:06.377
Part organic tissue,
part machine--

28:06.512 --> 28:08.864
that can do things
that humans can't.

28:08.899 --> 28:10.458
<i>They can change shapes,</i>

28:10.493 --> 28:12.122
<i>taking the form</i>
<i>of human beings.</i>

28:12.264 --> 28:13.053
<i>Over here,</i>

28:13.088 --> 28:16.185
they call them
"the first wave."

28:16.714 --> 28:18.496
So you're saying
that these hybrids

28:18.531 --> 28:21.079
are already on our side.

28:23.356 --> 28:25.098
I know it's difficult
to grasp.

28:25.229 --> 28:27.088
Oh, I can grasp it
just fine.

28:29.096 --> 28:31.623
I don't trust you,
Dr. Bell...

28:34.904 --> 28:36.164
or William or...

28:37.229 --> 28:38.064
Willam...

28:38.396 --> 28:40.130
or whatever cutesy name

28:40.170 --> 28:42.682
you think might appeal
to my childhood instincts.

28:43.404 --> 28:44.153
It won't.

28:45.750 --> 28:47.729
Your company
has been involved in,

28:47.764 --> 28:49.996
if not directly
responsible for,

28:50.031 --> 28:51.660
some of the most
horrific things

28:51.695 --> 28:52.851
that I have ever seen,

28:53.865 --> 28:56.604
to say nothing of the fact
that you just yanked me

28:56.639 --> 28:58.950
into a parallel universe
to warn me

28:59.009 --> 29:00.729
about an
inter-dimensional war

29:00.764 --> 29:03.357
that I believe you are
responsible for starting.

29:03.796 --> 29:07.151
So what I want
is not warmth or tea.

29:08.093 --> 29:09.183
It's the truth.

29:09.629 --> 29:11.281
The truth will come out.

29:11.595 --> 29:12.853
It always does.

29:16.695 --> 29:19.986
Livvy, you don't have
to trust me.

29:20.496 --> 29:22.029
You don't
even have to like me,

29:22.064 --> 29:27.239
but you can't deny
I have a unique perspective,

29:27.274 --> 29:29.535
shaped by having lived
in two worlds.

29:29.570 --> 29:32.805
I know the difference
a wrong choice can make...

29:33.317 --> 29:34.360
or a right one.

29:34.695 --> 29:36.697
For example, this building
is still standing

29:36.732 --> 29:38.613
because different choices
were made.

29:39.996 --> 29:44.113
So, Livvy, if you can look
past your anger,

29:44.829 --> 29:48.430
you may find that I'm more
of an ally than you think.

29:48.864 --> 29:50.067
[rumbling]

29:50.102 --> 29:51.097
[voices echoing]

29:51.662 --> 29:53.193
A storm is coming,

29:53.228 --> 29:56.562
perhaps the last
and worst storm of all.

29:56.597 --> 29:57.816
And when it is over,

29:57.996 --> 30:00.406
I fear there will be
little left of our world.

30:00.783 --> 30:03.583
The shape-shifters
on your side

30:03.618 --> 30:05.096
are looking for someone,

30:05.729 --> 30:08.595
someone to open the door
between universes,

30:08.630 --> 30:10.319
and if they find him,

30:10.496 --> 30:12.284
there will be
no stopping them,

30:13.295 --> 30:16.421
and that is why you
must find him first.

30:18.002 --> 30:18.663
Me?

30:20.248 --> 30:21.907
You are the one, Olivia.

30:22.762 --> 30:26.329
Of all the children
that Walter and I prepared,

30:27.029 --> 30:28.608
you were the strongest.

30:29.396 --> 30:31.952
You were always
the strongest.

30:32.844 --> 30:34.459
[rumbling]

30:41.595 --> 30:43.100
Remember this symbol.

30:43.129 --> 30:44.584
It's hidden
on their leader.

30:44.619 --> 30:45.562
That's how
you'll know him.

30:46.968 --> 30:48.414
- Show this to Nina Sharp.
- [rumbling]

30:48.862 --> 30:49.806
She can help you.

30:55.396 --> 30:56.466
We're out of time.

30:58.474 --> 30:59.431
[bell dings]

30:59.831 --> 31:00.763
<i>Olivia.</i>

31:00.798 --> 31:01.682
[echoing voices]

31:04.782 --> 31:05.507
- [rumbling]
PETER: Olivia.

31:06.029 --> 31:07.389
Olivia!
Can you hear me?

31:07.424 --> 31:09.565
Astrid, nitroglycerine,
30 CCs.

31:09.626 --> 31:11.018
Peter, please turn
the head to the side,

31:11.053 --> 31:11.966
make sure
she can breathe.

31:12.096 --> 31:13.218
Walter,
what's happening?

31:13.296 --> 31:15.169
I think she's receiving
a flood of memories.

31:15.204 --> 31:16.697
It could be too much,
too fast.

31:17.996 --> 31:18.962
<i>You should stand.</i>

31:19.097 --> 31:21.075
I think it'll be
less painful that way.

31:21.110 --> 31:21.818
What will?

31:22.263 --> 31:24.047
And remember this--

31:24.868 --> 31:26.965
<i>Einai kalytero...</i>

31:27.163 --> 31:30.193
<i>Anthropo apo ton</i>
<i>patera toy.</i>

31:30.228 --> 31:31.389
Tell that to Peter.

31:31.682 --> 31:33.158
You're going to need him
by your side.

31:33.358 --> 31:34.141
Tell it to him.

31:34.176 --> 31:35.577
He'll know
what it means.

31:35.595 --> 31:37.654
[rumbling]

31:37.963 --> 31:39.346
We have to shock
her heart.

31:40.048 --> 31:41.787
There's a vial
of adrenaline, Peter.

31:45.842 --> 31:46.929
And I'm afraid
there's no avoiding

31:46.964 --> 31:48.163
what has
to happen next.

31:48.296 --> 31:50.206
I pulled you out
of a moving car.

31:50.509 --> 31:52.195
Momentum
can be deferred,

31:52.196 --> 31:55.070
but it must always
be paid back in full.

31:55.832 --> 31:56.996
[rumbling]

31:57.530 --> 31:58.224
Okay.

31:58.530 --> 32:00.130
Into her heart,
between the ribs.

32:00.165 --> 32:02.403
Count to three:
One, two...

32:02.975 --> 32:04.427
As I once said
to Walter,

32:05.817 --> 32:07.241
physics is a bitch.

32:08.196 --> 32:10.032
- Three!
- Sorry, Olivia.

32:12.096 --> 32:14.336
[gasping, groaning in pain]

32:16.585 --> 32:18.194
I need to speak
to Nina Sharp.

32:24.306 --> 32:26.156
- <i>Nina Sharp.</i>
- Nina, we need to talk.

32:26.191 --> 32:27.031
<i>Olivia?</i>

32:27.066 --> 32:28.732
Look, I'm on my way
there now.

32:28.789 --> 32:30.648
I'm sorry. I'm just about
to leave for Hong Kong.

32:30.889 --> 32:32.670
I have a message
from William Bell.

32:33.936 --> 32:35.280
Cancel the plane.

32:36.586 --> 32:38.617
I wish I could have been
more of a help to you.

32:38.652 --> 32:39.661
Oh, you did great.

32:39.696 --> 32:41.100
You sure you're all right
to drive?

32:41.380 --> 32:42.235
Oh, she's fine.

32:42.270 --> 32:44.960
The injections I gave her
would have counteracted

32:44.995 --> 32:47.078
any hallucinogenics
in her system.

32:47.189 --> 32:49.024
- Peter.
- Yeah?

32:50.856 --> 32:53.258
I think I'd like
to drive home with her.

32:55.549 --> 32:57.756
You just said that all the drugs
were out of her system.

33:09.689 --> 33:11.428
How are you gonna get
back home, Walter?

33:13.481 --> 33:14.486
The bus.

33:18.390 --> 33:19.352
Okay.

33:21.956 --> 33:23.377
Peter,
I need some money.

33:32.555 --> 33:33.827
He said okay.

33:34.023 --> 33:35.032
Terrific.

33:42.422 --> 33:43.966
It was a pleasure
meeting you.

33:44.522 --> 33:45.431
You too, Peter.

33:45.890 --> 33:47.874
Say good-bye to Agent Dunham
for me, will you?

33:53.889 --> 33:54.698
What?

33:54.789 --> 33:56.558
Oh, nothing. I...

33:56.589 --> 33:58.814
[sighs]
I'm sorry.

33:58.849 --> 34:00.588
It's probably
just the drugs.

34:10.922 --> 34:11.847
ASTRID: Hey.

34:12.123 --> 34:13.018
CHARLIE:
Where is everyone?

34:13.356 --> 34:15.396
Uh, Peter
and Dr. Bishop are out,

34:15.455 --> 34:17.955
and Olivia went to New York
to see Nina Sharp.

34:18.056 --> 34:19.163
<i>I can call her</i>
<i>if you want me to.</i>

34:19.234 --> 34:19.626
<i>She just left</i>

34:19.676 --> 34:20.860
- <i>a few minutes--</i>
- No, that's okay.

34:21.621 --> 34:23.053
I'll talk to her
when she gets back.

34:30.513 --> 34:31.527
<i>What is this?</i>

34:32.956 --> 34:34.768
<i>Oh, that's</i>
<i>Massive Dynamic.</i>

34:34.889 --> 34:36.987
<i>They're rebuilding the image</i>
<i>from the broken device.</i>

34:40.688 --> 34:41.896
Dr. Bell
showed you this?

34:42.123 --> 34:42.652
OLIVIA: <i>Yeah.</i>

34:43.489 --> 34:45.935
Have you ever seen
that before--that symbol?

34:47.589 --> 34:48.466
No.

34:55.656 --> 34:57.539
Well, that's
what he told me.

34:58.289 --> 34:59.193
He said
it would be hidden

34:59.253 --> 35:01.099
somewhere
on their leader's body.

35:01.422 --> 35:03.418
Well, then I suspect
it would be on his head,

35:03.789 --> 35:04.903
assuming that's what

35:04.938 --> 35:06.870
the cryogenic hijackings
are about.

35:08.323 --> 35:10.381
And that's all Dr. Bell
told you?

35:16.323 --> 35:18.339
He said that the man
with that mark...

35:20.789 --> 35:23.837
would try to open a door
between our two worlds...

35:25.390 --> 35:27.531
that a storm was coming,

35:27.989 --> 35:29.353
and that the only way
to stop it

35:29.422 --> 35:32.654
would be for me to find him
before the shape-shifters did.

35:35.056 --> 35:36.069
A storm?

35:37.087 --> 35:37.875
Yeah.

35:43.656 --> 35:44.446
What?

35:46.589 --> 35:48.701
It was a phrase
he used.

35:51.422 --> 35:54.329
When Dr. Bell realized
the existence of the other side,

35:54.723 --> 35:56.094
the thing
he dreaded most

35:56.183 --> 35:58.079
was the inevitable
collision...

35:58.923 --> 36:01.376
if our two universes
ever came together.

36:01.604 --> 36:02.601
Collision?

36:03.189 --> 36:05.162
The Pauli exclusion principle

36:05.224 --> 36:08.322
means that no two objects
can occupy the same space

36:08.357 --> 36:09.425
at the same time.

36:10.178 --> 36:12.340
Dr. Bell was afraid
that if the doorway

36:12.375 --> 36:14.199
between the two sides
was ever opened

36:14.889 --> 36:17.250
that the unavoidable
conclusion...

36:18.785 --> 36:20.991
<i>only one world</i>
<i>would remain.</i>

36:22.326 --> 36:24.641
It's what he called
the last great storm.

36:28.390 --> 36:30.261
[high-pitched tone,
rumbling]

36:31.856 --> 36:33.844
BELL:
<i>Laston-Hennings Cryonics.</i>

36:36.456 --> 36:38.256
[cell phone rings]

36:54.522 --> 36:56.230
I'm sorry.
I have to go.

36:58.189 --> 36:58.962
<i>Olivia?</i>

36:59.956 --> 37:03.549
Whatever Massive Dynamic can do
to help find this man,

37:04.889 --> 37:06.335
we're at your service.

37:08.422 --> 37:10.051
[thunder rumbling]

37:11.455 --> 37:13.646
- How'd you know?
- Listen to me carefully.

37:13.756 --> 37:15.242
My car's
around the corner,

37:15.292 --> 37:17.210
we got
a SWAT team inbound.

37:17.455 --> 37:19.601
As soon as I verify
you're out of this building,

37:20.156 --> 37:21.517
they're gonna
shred this place.

37:21.518 --> 37:22.435
Let's move.

37:23.290 --> 37:26.332
Oh, God, Charlie,
I almost told her everything.

37:26.656 --> 37:28.123
I got to call Broyles.

37:28.158 --> 37:29.155
What do
you mean "almost"?

37:29.489 --> 37:30.961
Well, I just realized
where it is,

37:30.996 --> 37:32.356
the head
that they're looking for.

37:32.391 --> 37:33.310
[beep]
Bell told me.

37:33.411 --> 37:35.500
It's at
Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

37:58.044 --> 37:59.951
Ohh!

38:14.109 --> 38:15.137
[coughing]

38:15.230 --> 38:15.892
It's me.

38:16.753 --> 38:18.518
Laston-Hennings Cryonics.

38:22.054 --> 38:22.961
[gunshot]

38:39.853 --> 38:41.004
What are you doing?

39:24.777 --> 39:25.992
Won't you come in?

39:27.216 --> 39:28.901
I don't think I should.

39:29.286 --> 39:31.762
The bus leaves
every half hour, and...

39:33.587 --> 39:38.313
Oh, I only have 14 minutes
to walk to the stop.

39:42.586 --> 39:44.176
Some day, huh?

39:45.119 --> 39:46.453
[laughs]

39:46.787 --> 39:49.387
Not at all what I expected
when I woke up this morning.

39:49.422 --> 39:50.687
That's the way of things.

39:52.054 --> 39:55.234
The best days and
the worst days rarely are.

40:03.319 --> 40:05.154
Rebecca, what I did to you--
It was wrong.

40:05.206 --> 40:06.528
- Oh, Walter.
- No, no.

40:06.588 --> 40:10.267
You were young,
and I took advantage,

40:10.720 --> 40:11.792
and...

40:26.620 --> 40:27.349
[exhales sharply]

40:27.422 --> 40:29.569
I've wanted to do that
for so long.

40:32.620 --> 40:35.088
Oh, Walter,
what you did--

40:35.120 --> 40:36.444
You made me...

40:38.319 --> 40:39.392
special.

40:44.553 --> 40:45.638
The truth is...

40:48.520 --> 40:50.376
I believe
you were always special.

40:55.353 --> 40:56.498
I must go...

40:58.186 --> 40:59.353
under 12 minutes.

41:09.787 --> 41:11.226
You had no choice.

41:11.653 --> 41:12.653
If you didn't kill him,

41:12.734 --> 41:13.839
he would have
killed you.

41:22.054 --> 41:23.591
It's not your fault.

41:24.596 --> 41:28.061
Whatever that <i>thing</i> was,
it wasn't Charlie.

41:30.286 --> 41:31.813
They killed him
for what?

41:35.987 --> 41:38.355
To open a door
to the other side?

41:41.320 --> 41:44.225
And who are these people,
and what do they want?

41:46.386 --> 41:47.504
What did we do
to them?

41:53.853 --> 41:56.319
Laston-Hennings Cryonics
was hit 15 minutes

41:56.354 --> 41:58.204
before our
protective detail arrived.

41:58.453 --> 41:59.567
They took everything.

41:59.887 --> 42:01.479
All the cryo-capsules
are gone.

42:03.620 --> 42:05.276
So they found
who they were looking for.

42:06.986 --> 42:08.111
I assume so.

42:11.553 --> 42:13.714
William Bell pulled me
to another universe...

42:14.196 --> 42:15.589
to give me a warning.

42:15.953 --> 42:17.595
That's how important
this is.

42:24.386 --> 42:25.787
And I failed.

42:25.822 --> 42:28.728
Olivia,
we'll find them.

42:44.687 --> 42:46.300
[razor whirring]
