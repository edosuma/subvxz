00:17.643 --> 00:21.167
Fugitive! Though the Republic
has won many decisive battles

00:21.248 --> 00:23.410
against the Separatist army
in the Outer Rim,

00:23.492 --> 00:27.337
the Jedi have failed
to capture the elusive General Grievous.

00:27.417 --> 00:31.983
After specifically targeting members
of the Jedi Council, a trap was set,

00:32.064 --> 00:34.226
but following a fierce confrontation,

00:34.307 --> 00:38.673
the droid general managed to escape
to the surface of the planet Saleucami.

00:38.753 --> 00:40.395
Now the chase is on

00:40.476 --> 00:43.439
as General Kenobi leads a squadron
of clone troopers

00:43.521 --> 00:46.244
and closes in on his desperate target.

00:51.172 --> 00:55.417
We must find a way off this planet
before they find us.

00:56.339 --> 01:00.744
Kenobi! We need to hurry
and find an escape pod.

01:05.150 --> 01:08.396
Instead of scattering our troops
looking for all the escape pods,

01:08.476 --> 01:11.079
we shall head towards the wreckage
of the landing transport first.

01:15.446 --> 01:17.048
Contact the fleet.

01:17.369 --> 01:20.252
Sir, our transmitter is destroyed.

01:21.015 --> 01:24.419
There is only one escape pod
that survived.

01:24.540 --> 01:30.347
We must get there as quickly as possible.
Let's hope the transmitter is still intact.

01:30.428 --> 01:33.071
Now, find me some transportation.

01:48.574 --> 01:52.499
General Kenobi!
Sir, the cruiser's returned to orbit.

01:52.580 --> 01:56.705
- Any sign of Grievous?
- I believe we've found Grievous' ship.

01:57.548 --> 02:00.431
Power low.

02:00.471 --> 02:03.915
The power is...
I can't go on.

02:03.997 --> 02:07.040
Sir, we need to get our power recharged.

02:07.121 --> 02:12.448
Not this again. How could your power cells
be so depleted?

02:12.489 --> 02:15.813
You would not let us ride
on one of those creatures with you, sir.

02:15.853 --> 02:18.096
If you would allow us to close down
for a few...

02:20.140 --> 02:21.781
Any more complaints?

02:21.863 --> 02:24.185
- No. Nope. No.
- No. I don't think so.

02:24.306 --> 02:26.228
That's what I thought.

02:26.709 --> 02:28.832
Now, let's find that pod.

02:29.994 --> 02:31.035
Yikes.

02:36.844 --> 02:41.049
Thermal housing intakes are still warm.
This couldn't have happened too long ago.

02:41.170 --> 02:43.372
The crew compartment's
almost entirely destroyed.

02:44.095 --> 02:45.175
We'll split into teams.

02:45.296 --> 02:48.100
Rex, take Jesse, Hardcase and Kix
and search those wetlands.

02:48.221 --> 02:48.884
Yes, sir.

02:48.918 --> 02:50.464
Crys and I will pick it up
from here.

02:50.681 --> 02:55.408
And, Rex, if you get a visual on Grievous,
contact us before you engage.

03:00.456 --> 03:04.581
- Rex is a smart man.
- Indeed. Always thinking on his feet.

03:09.749 --> 03:11.871
These droids are too gone
to give us any good intel.

03:16.037 --> 03:17.239
Here's one!

03:41.836 --> 03:43.477
Take the shot.

03:46.362 --> 03:47.683
Protect the Captain!

03:59.501 --> 04:00.742
Commando droids.

04:06.070 --> 04:07.671
Jesse, you better get back here.

04:14.162 --> 04:15.203
What do you have?

04:15.324 --> 04:18.245
We've broken the access codes and
powered up the droid's guidance system.

04:18.368 --> 04:19.648
According to his memory logs,

04:19.690 --> 04:21.571
he fired the emergency thrusters
on the escape pod

04:21.613 --> 04:23.214
to avoid a midair collision.

04:23.335 --> 04:25.377
- Collision with what?
- Another escape pod.

04:25.418 --> 04:27.620
There was no time to correct
for the steeper glide path,

04:27.661 --> 04:29.783
which is why this droid's pod crashed.

04:29.905 --> 04:32.267
Can you pinpoint the landing zone
for the other pod?

04:32.308 --> 04:34.510
I can put us
within two to three clicks of it, sir.

04:34.551 --> 04:37.195
Alert the men. We've picked up the scent.

04:38.397 --> 04:40.158
- How bad?
- Pretty bad.

04:40.279 --> 04:42.882
I need to remove his armor
to see the full extent of the damage.

04:42.923 --> 04:45.006
Those snipers might have called
for backup.

04:45.127 --> 04:47.209
Unless we want
to start getting picked off one by one,

04:47.330 --> 04:49.331
- we should find better cover first.
- Mmm-hmm.

04:50.694 --> 04:54.138
Wait a minute.
Those critters are domesticated.

04:54.259 --> 04:57.343
- Sir?
- I think we're on farmland.

04:57.464 --> 05:01.028
And where there's a farm,
there's usually a farmer.

05:01.149 --> 05:02.431
Let's find his homestead.

05:20.056 --> 05:21.498
We want no trouble here.

05:21.979 --> 05:25.423
Easy with that weapon, ma'am.
We're here as friends.

05:25.505 --> 05:28.067
- State your business.
- Our captain's been hurt. We need...

05:28.149 --> 05:30.551
- I'm no doctor, so just...
We have a medic, ma'am.

05:30.632 --> 05:32.915
We just need a place
to tend to him overnight.

05:33.036 --> 05:35.679
- Mommy, who's...
- Get back inside, both of you!

05:35.759 --> 05:37.000
Oh!
Mom!

05:37.042 --> 05:39.764
Look, there are some benches
out back in the barn.

05:39.845 --> 05:42.769
- It's the best I can do.
- That'll be fine, ma'am. Thank you.

05:48.578 --> 05:50.901
What... What happened?

05:50.981 --> 05:52.623
Commando droids took a potshot.

05:52.744 --> 05:56.308
That would've gone straight through your
heart had it been two inches to the left.

05:56.430 --> 05:59.313
- I can't move my arm.
- You have some nerve damage.

05:59.353 --> 06:03.559
Understood. Now patch me up,
and let's get on with it.

06:03.640 --> 06:07.645
Sir, you're in no condition.
It will heal, but it will take time.

06:07.725 --> 06:09.767
We're getting
underway, Kix.

06:09.849 --> 06:12.972
- That's an order.
- Sir, as the team medic,

06:13.093 --> 06:15.976
when it comes to the health of the men,
including you,

06:16.018 --> 06:17.299
I outrank everyone.

06:17.740 --> 06:20.303
So I respectfully order you, sir,

06:20.384 --> 06:22.346
- to get some...
- Excuse me.

06:23.668 --> 06:26.752
- If there's not enough...
- That's plenty. Thank you, uh...

06:26.873 --> 06:27.994
Suu.

06:30.238 --> 06:32.681
I told you to stay in the house.

06:32.802 --> 06:35.525
I couldn't help it, Mom. It got away.

06:38.770 --> 06:44.098
- You look like my daddy.
- Shaeeah, don't bother the soldier.

06:44.178 --> 06:47.062
- Now get inside with your brother.
- Yes, Mom.

06:47.103 --> 06:51.387
My husband is away
delivering our first harvest.

06:51.429 --> 06:54.031
- Do you require anything else?
- No.

06:54.313 --> 06:55.994
- Thank you, Suu.
- Mmm.

07:01.002 --> 07:06.289
Resume the search without me.
Jesse, you're in command. I'll be fine.

07:18.067 --> 07:19.989
There's our escape pod.

07:21.071 --> 07:24.556
- Any sign of Grievous?
It looks deserted.

07:25.598 --> 07:27.920
He must be heading
to a second escape pod.

07:28.963 --> 07:31.285
- Captain Rex, come in, please.
- It's Jesse, sir.

07:31.767 --> 07:33.929
- Rex was injured.
- What's his condition?

07:34.331 --> 07:36.733
He'll be fine. But we had
to find him shelter for the night.

07:37.215 --> 07:39.858
Grievous is on the move.
We're headed to the west.

07:39.939 --> 07:42.301
Swing around and we can meet up
at the final escape pod.

07:42.663 --> 07:45.225
We're going to need all the firepower
we can muster.

07:45.266 --> 07:46.908
Roger that, sir.
We're speeding towards you.

08:02.091 --> 08:04.533
No, no, no, no, no.

08:30.051 --> 08:33.215
We should be there by now.

08:33.294 --> 08:38.101
We are, sir,
there almost.

08:38.222 --> 08:42.107
You had better be interpreting
the coordinates correctly.

08:42.149 --> 08:44.871
Oh, no.

08:45.954 --> 08:49.479
We're almost there, sir. One click out.
Straight ahead.

08:49.679 --> 08:53.804
I'm losing power.

09:26.974 --> 09:30.177
Who are you? What are you doing here?

09:33.142 --> 09:34.303
You're a clone.

09:34.344 --> 09:38.829
So, I see the war has finally made its way
out here.

09:39.271 --> 09:42.795
And I guess I can expect a visit
from some droids soon.

09:42.836 --> 09:44.357
What's your number and rank?

09:45.399 --> 09:50.967
My name is Lawquane. Cut
Lawquane. And I'm just a simple farmer.

09:51.168 --> 09:52.569
You're a deserter.

09:52.891 --> 09:54.412
Well,

09:54.493 --> 09:58.097
I like to think I'm merely
exercising my freedom to choose.

09:58.218 --> 10:02.544
- To choose not to kill for a living.
- That is not your choice to make.

10:02.665 --> 10:05.868
You swore an oath to the Republic.
You have a duty.

10:05.909 --> 10:10.475
I have a duty. You're right.
But it's to my family.

10:10.556 --> 10:13.199
Does that count,
or do you still plan to turn me in?

10:13.280 --> 10:14.561
Do I have a choice?

10:14.682 --> 10:16.644
Daddy, you're home!

10:17.927 --> 10:19.248
Look what I drew you, Dad!

10:19.328 --> 10:23.134
Well, well, well.
That's great, Jek.

10:23.214 --> 10:24.776
I see you two have met.

10:24.816 --> 10:27.540
He looks just like you, Daddy. I told him.

10:27.580 --> 10:30.464
Oh, you did, huh?

10:30.545 --> 10:33.268
I was just making our guest, Captain, um...

10:33.389 --> 10:34.510
What's your number?

10:34.591 --> 10:37.474
Rex. I also have a name, believe it or not.

10:37.555 --> 10:42.762
He was injured. His men brought him here.
I told them he could stay just for the night.

10:42.842 --> 10:46.607
Course he can.
We never turn away those in need, do we?

10:46.728 --> 10:49.732
No, we always help anyone we can.

10:49.812 --> 10:53.177
Right. You, um... You look hungry, Rex.

10:53.298 --> 10:57.984
- No, I'm fine. I'll stay here.
- No, you have to eat with us, please!

10:58.105 --> 10:59.425
- Please! Please!
Please!

10:59.547 --> 11:01.189
They're never gonna stop till you say yes.

11:01.269 --> 11:02.750
All right, I'll join you.

11:15.930 --> 11:19.614
Yes, well, you and I may be clones,
but we're still individuals.

11:19.736 --> 11:22.939
You have a name rather than a number,
Captain. Why is that?

11:22.981 --> 11:26.665
Perhaps our leaders feel it's
a more efficient way of distinguishing us.

11:26.706 --> 11:28.868
More efficient than a number?

11:29.229 --> 11:31.472
I doubt the Kaminoans think that way.

11:31.553 --> 11:34.636
Still, a name has to make you feel unique.

11:34.678 --> 11:37.521
Especially in an army where everyone
looks like you and talks like you...

11:37.562 --> 11:40.084
Actually, I've never really thought about it.

11:40.125 --> 11:42.608
- Yes, you have.
- Well, how would you know?

11:42.689 --> 11:46.974
Because I am as close to you
as any life form can be.

11:48.938 --> 11:52.061
I've seen how you look
at my family, our home...

11:53.905 --> 11:56.949
Come on, Rex, admit it. You've thought
about what your life could look like

11:57.030 --> 12:00.714
if you were to also leave the army,
choose the life you want.

12:00.796 --> 12:03.358
What if I am choosing the life I want?

12:03.439 --> 12:06.563
What if I'm staying in the army
because it's meaningful to me?

12:06.644 --> 12:08.886
And how is it meaningful?

12:08.967 --> 12:12.771
Because I'm part of the most pivotal
moment in the history of the Republic.

12:12.893 --> 12:15.896
If we fail,
then our children and their children

12:15.977 --> 12:19.421
could be forced to live
under an evil I can't well imagine.

12:19.502 --> 12:21.624
If you were to have children, of course.

12:21.745 --> 12:24.989
But that would be against the rules,
wouldn't it?

12:25.070 --> 12:27.472
Isn't that what somebody
programmed you to believe, Captain?

12:27.554 --> 12:29.956
No, Cut, it's simply what I believe.

12:30.077 --> 12:33.121
It doesn't matter if it's my children
or other people's children.

12:33.162 --> 12:35.084
Does that meet with your approval?

12:35.205 --> 12:38.289
Perfectly. To each his own.
That's what I always say.

12:38.369 --> 12:39.891
What does that mean, Daddy?

12:40.012 --> 12:42.935
It means you can do anything
with your life that you want to.

12:48.544 --> 12:51.547
- How are you doing, Jesse?
- Closing in, sir. We have a visual.

12:51.908 --> 12:54.031
Very well, we'll meet you in the middle.

12:59.280 --> 13:03.725
- Is your transmitter working?
- I don't know. I haven't used it yet.

13:04.567 --> 13:06.328
All right, I'll check on it.

13:06.490 --> 13:08.412
Stupid battle droids!

13:08.693 --> 13:10.334
Sir, you made it.

13:10.376 --> 13:11.496
Get back in the pod

13:11.617 --> 13:15.021
and send out a distress signal
to what's left of our fleet.

13:15.142 --> 13:18.306
We need to get a shuttle
down here immediately.

13:18.347 --> 13:20.910
Roger, roger, but I must inform you, sir,

13:20.951 --> 13:24.875
there are multiple life forms approaching
from the east and west.

13:24.916 --> 13:26.237
Battle positions!

13:29.443 --> 13:32.286
Good move. Very good move.

13:32.928 --> 13:36.773
- So what was it?
- What made me decide to leave the corps?

13:39.177 --> 13:40.938
Shortly after the Battle of Geonosis,

13:41.060 --> 13:44.304
our troop transport got caught
between two Separatist gunships.

13:44.425 --> 13:47.348
They fired on us with everything they had.
We crashed.

13:47.389 --> 13:50.192
Most of us were either dead
or severely injured.

13:50.233 --> 13:53.917
So when they started working their way
through the wounded, killing us off,

13:54.039 --> 13:56.601
I knew there was no hope. I ran.

13:58.085 --> 13:59.886
It still haunts me.

14:00.608 --> 14:01.769
I'm sorry.

14:02.411 --> 14:05.454
It's the day I felt
my life didn't have any meaning.

14:05.495 --> 14:08.779
Everyone I cared about,
my team, was gone.

14:10.262 --> 14:13.306
I was just another expendable clone
waiting for my turn

14:13.427 --> 14:15.869
to be slaughtered in a war
that made no sense to me.

14:16.831 --> 14:18.312
Can you understand that, Rex?

14:19.716 --> 14:23.119
I've been in countless battles
and lost many brothers.

14:23.240 --> 14:25.763
They were my family, my home.

14:30.972 --> 14:34.456
Daddy, we finished our chores.
Can we go outside and play?

14:34.577 --> 14:35.578
Please.

14:36.380 --> 14:39.743
- Okay, only for a few minutes.
- Thank you, Daddy! Come on, Jek.

14:39.785 --> 14:41.386
Okay.
- And keep the house in view.

14:41.507 --> 14:42.507
We will.

14:42.628 --> 14:44.511
You have wonderful children.

14:45.473 --> 14:47.916
I know you think I'm a coward, Rex.

14:48.037 --> 14:52.282
But believe me, I'll fight to my last breath
to keep them safe.

14:55.927 --> 14:57.168
Fire!

15:06.343 --> 15:07.584
Tank two! Port side!

15:10.429 --> 15:11.430
Great shot!

15:11.951 --> 15:13.352
Where is that ship?

15:16.919 --> 15:19.321
Shaeeah? Where are you?

15:22.045 --> 15:25.770
Shaeeah, where are you?
Stop fooling around.

15:25.891 --> 15:27.092
Boo!

15:27.173 --> 15:30.337
- You're not funny.
- Am too!

15:31.980 --> 15:35.664
- Look. In the field.
- What is it?

15:37.067 --> 15:39.150
It wasn't there before.

15:40.151 --> 15:42.073
It's some kind of spaceship, I think.

15:42.755 --> 15:43.916
Hello?

15:44.638 --> 15:46.079
Hello?

15:46.681 --> 15:48.323
Do you think
somebody's in there?

16:05.147 --> 16:08.833
Uh-oh.
I didn't do it. You did it.

16:11.076 --> 16:12.758
Run!
Run!

16:15.082 --> 16:18.486
- Run! Run! Run!
- Monsters! Run! Run!

16:20.810 --> 16:22.812
Monsters!

16:23.133 --> 16:26.898
- Shaeeah? Jek? What's wrong?
- Monsters! They're chasing us!

16:26.979 --> 16:29.341
What monsters, honey? Where?

16:30.945 --> 16:33.067
They hatched from the big egg in the field!

16:36.673 --> 16:40.197
Ah. This is not good. I count 20.

16:40.279 --> 16:43.642
- Cut, what's out there?
- Commando droids.

16:43.724 --> 16:44.924
What are they doing?

16:45.726 --> 16:48.409
- Suu, get the kids upstairs.
- Come. Come, children. Come now!

16:51.855 --> 16:53.416
What weapons do you have?

16:55.220 --> 16:57.382
We can catch them in a crossfire.
You take that corner.

16:57.464 --> 17:00.747
No, Captain.
With respect, you're not in charge here.

17:00.828 --> 17:01.949
I can be useful.

17:02.030 --> 17:05.473
Sir, you're injured.
You have only one good arm.

17:06.356 --> 17:08.637
- But I can fight.
- So can I.

17:09.319 --> 17:13.325
Rex, I need you
to be the last line of defense for my family.

17:17.452 --> 17:20.496
- I'll take care of them.
- Thank you.

17:49.018 --> 17:50.059
Finally!

17:50.700 --> 17:55.065
General Grievous, sir. We see you
below us. Are you ready to depart?

17:56.028 --> 17:58.630
Concentrate your fire on that ship!

18:01.475 --> 18:04.559
Hey! They're shooting at us!
Coming back around.

18:07.645 --> 18:09.967
Sir, that ship's coming around
for another landing attempt.

18:10.008 --> 18:12.490
Keep firing! Don't let that ship land.

18:12.932 --> 18:15.615
- The guns are overheated!
- Always something.

18:16.137 --> 18:17.658
Cody, Jesse, cover me.

18:18.621 --> 18:20.783
General, behind you!

18:51.708 --> 18:53.309
Rex, they're coming for you!

19:20.390 --> 19:22.912
Daddy? Daddy?

19:23.595 --> 19:26.558
I'm okay. It's over.

19:27.039 --> 19:28.320
No!

19:35.371 --> 19:37.212
Forget trying to land.

19:43.743 --> 19:45.425
Fire the engines.

19:48.991 --> 19:50.472
Jedi scum!

19:53.477 --> 19:57.482
- Are you all right, sir?
- No. We're right back where we started.

19:58.004 --> 20:00.487
Call the cruisers.
See if they can stop that ship.

20:00.528 --> 20:01.648
Right away, sir!

20:01.689 --> 20:04.251
And tell them to send someone
to pick us up.

20:10.943 --> 20:12.864
All right, that should do it.

20:12.905 --> 20:16.430
Captain Rex, are you going
to turn in my husband?

20:16.551 --> 20:18.953
I'm sorry, Suu, it's my duty.

20:20.356 --> 20:23.600
But in my condition,
I probably won't remember any of this.

20:23.721 --> 20:25.082
Thank you.

20:25.203 --> 20:28.567
You're still a deserter, Cut,
but you're certainly not a coward.

20:28.608 --> 20:30.530
Captain Rex,
are you still with us?

20:30.651 --> 20:34.495
Yes, General Kenobi. I'm still with you
and thankfully on the mend, sir.

20:34.537 --> 20:37.540
That's great news.
We certainly missed you at the party.

20:37.581 --> 20:40.745
Sorry, sir. I had to attend one of my own.

20:40.785 --> 20:43.308
Can't wait to hear about it.
We're standing by.

20:43.990 --> 20:47.995
- You're welcome to stay, Rex.
- This is your home, Cut.

20:48.116 --> 20:50.359
My family is elsewhere.

20:51.481 --> 20:53.082
- Goodbye!
- Bye!

20:59.492 --> 21:00.973
- Bye!
- Bye-bye!
