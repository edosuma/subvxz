WEBVTT

00:00.953 --> 00:02.178
He-Man.

00:02.220 --> 00:06.478
And the Masters of the Universe.

00:06.520 --> 00:08.378
I am Adam, Prince of Eternia.

00:08.420 --> 00:09.539
Defender of the

00:09.564 --> 00:11.778
secrets of Castle Grayskull.

00:11.820 --> 00:15.943
This is Cringer, my fearless friend.

00:15.986 --> 00:17.844
Fabulous secret powers were revealed

00:17.869 --> 00:19.978
to me the day I held aloft

00:20.020 --> 00:22.154
my magic sword and said,

00:22.179 --> 00:24.668
by the power of Grayskull.

00:27.420 --> 00:31.578
I have the power!

00:38.786 --> 00:39.913
Cringer became the

00:39.938 --> 00:41.978
mighty Battle Cat, and I became

00:42.020 --> 00:43.876
He-Man, the most

00:43.901 --> 00:46.402
powerful man in the universe.

00:49.286 --> 00:51.778
Only three others share this secret:

00:52.620 --> 00:54.851
Our friends the Sorceress,

00:54.876 --> 00:56.911
Man-at-Arms, and Orko.

00:56.935 --> 00:59.588
Together we defend Castle Grayskull from,

00:59.613 --> 01:02.117
the evil forces of Skeletor.

01:36.769 --> 01:39.670
They are ready for transporting, Beast Man.

01:39.738 --> 01:43.469
The dragon's eggs. And the dragon pearl...

01:43.943 --> 01:46.639
Mer-Man found it in the Slime Swamp.

01:48.380 --> 01:51.617
The fool traded it to
me for Eternian silver.

01:51.617 --> 01:54.677
He doesn't know it's value.
He doesn't know...

02:00.793 --> 02:02.852
The mother dragon.

02:08.366 --> 02:10.130
Stop her, Beast Man.

02:10.202 --> 02:13.433
Stop!  I command you...

02:22.292 --> 02:26.194
She is protecting her eggs, Skeletor.

02:26.218 --> 02:27.879
I can't control her.

02:28.521 --> 02:30.079
I think we'd better leave.

02:32.158 --> 02:34.456
A lot of good you are, Beast-brain,

02:35.194 --> 02:37.822
and you'll leave when I tell you to.

02:43.602 --> 02:46.272
Get the Air-Cart out of
here before she comes back,

02:46.272 --> 02:47.705
and do it now.

02:49.241 --> 02:53.200
What makes you think you
can always order me around?

02:54.480 --> 02:56.880
This!
Now move!

03:08.360 --> 03:12.524
Well, little dragons.
You'll soon be in your new home.

03:21.940 --> 03:23.965
We'll take the last plate now, Orko.

03:30.249 --> 03:32.308
Ah. Boy, am I stuffed!

03:32.718 --> 03:36.654
Pity, you're not not two Orkos.
You could eat twice as much.

03:37.656 --> 03:39.055
Not a bad idea.

03:45.030 --> 03:46.999
Wow, that never worked before.

03:46.999 --> 03:50.457
If I were four Orkos I could
eat four times as much.

03:58.310 --> 03:59.912
Now, there are four of me.

03:59.912 --> 04:02.938
I'll bet I'm four times
as powerful a magician.

04:05.417 --> 04:08.045
You are not, I'm four times as powerful.

04:08.120 --> 04:10.782
Says who?
I'm four times as powerful.

04:10.856 --> 04:12.824
No.  I am!

04:13.025 --> 04:14.890
Me! Stop it.

04:17.529 --> 04:19.190
Hey guys! Hold it!

04:20.933 --> 04:23.368
Why can't you co-operate?

04:23.368 --> 04:24.736
You know, use some teamwork.

04:24.736 --> 04:26.271
Teamwork, us?

04:26.271 --> 04:29.297
When things look bad,
teamwork's the answer.

04:31.076 --> 04:33.044
Okay, we'll give it a shot?

04:40.652 --> 04:42.779
Hey! We did it.

04:44.223 --> 04:47.021
Oh well. It was fun while it lasted.

04:48.293 --> 04:50.523
That trick wasn't supposed
to shake the room.

04:59.705 --> 05:03.300
A baby dragon! Isn't it cute?

05:05.711 --> 05:07.645
Look!  It's growing larger!

05:14.887 --> 05:15.911
Look out.

05:22.160 --> 05:23.929
Your Majesties, come with me.

05:23.929 --> 05:25.260
Adam, get the guards.

05:34.439 --> 05:37.408
I don't think I care for baby dragons.

05:38.210 --> 05:40.405
By the power of Grayskull!

05:52.591 --> 05:55.719
I have the power!

06:15.213 --> 06:18.205
C'mon, dragon-face. Take your best shot.

06:22.821 --> 06:23.947
Now, He-Man.

06:26.024 --> 06:29.118
Just hold that pose, flame-face!

06:39.071 --> 06:40.595
Need a hand, He-Man?

06:40.772 --> 06:42.330
The more, the merrier.

06:53.785 --> 06:55.844
Here I come!  Ready or not!

07:00.691 --> 07:04.320
Thats the hardest dragon I ever rammed.

07:08.634 --> 07:09.634
You missed.

07:15.207 --> 07:16.469
That's better.

07:23.949 --> 07:26.451
How convenient.
I was looking for something...

07:26.451 --> 07:28.646
to test my new stasis-ray on.

07:29.354 --> 07:31.254
It won't be able to move for hours.

07:31.356 --> 07:33.187
Where could that dragon have come from?

07:33.291 --> 07:36.192
Well, Beast Man has the
power to control animals,

07:36.395 --> 07:39.193
and Skeletor, controls Beast Man.

07:52.978 --> 07:56.914
I'm so powerful, I even impress myself!

07:57.182 --> 07:59.116
Gah, but you don't impress me.

07:59.451 --> 08:03.182
Some day, I'll show you
what power really is.

08:03.622 --> 08:07.956
Did you say something?
No, nothing, Skeletor.

08:12.531 --> 08:15.600
Good, the growth serum works perfectly.

08:15.600 --> 08:17.235
Baby dragons grow to...

08:17.235 --> 08:19.671
full size in less than a minute.

08:19.671 --> 08:23.041
And if you think thats magic,
wait till you see what I do...

08:23.041 --> 08:25.009
with the Dragon's Pearl.

08:34.251 --> 08:36.888
Teela, Avion has just been attacked by a...

08:36.888 --> 08:38.190
Let me guess:

08:38.190 --> 08:39.191
a dragon.

08:39.191 --> 08:41.259
Right, how did you know?

08:41.259 --> 08:44.329
Dragon eggs are falling from
the sky all over Eternia.

08:44.329 --> 08:45.694
Look!

08:52.237 --> 08:54.467
It's time for your nap, Flame Thrower.

08:58.677 --> 09:01.646
A good thing my father made
more than one Stasis Ray.

09:09.888 --> 09:10.912
Now!

09:22.100 --> 09:24.295
There. That oughta hold him for a while.

09:26.338 --> 09:28.640
This dragon hunting, is tiring business.

09:28.640 --> 09:31.042
I'm afraid there's no time for rest.

09:31.042 --> 09:33.602
There are more dragons waiting
in the Mystic Mountains.

09:42.888 --> 09:45.220
My plan has worked perfectly.

09:45.290 --> 09:48.054
While He-Man and his
friends are busy...

09:48.126 --> 09:49.855
battling the dragon invasion...

09:49.928 --> 09:52.624
we will enter Castle Grayskull.

09:52.964 --> 09:55.398
The space portal will transport us there.

09:55.467 --> 09:56.467
Follow me.

10:11.283 --> 10:13.080
Our new home:

10:13.685 --> 10:15.812
Castle Grayskull!

10:16.221 --> 10:17.689
We can't get in.

10:17.689 --> 10:20.892
He-Man and the Sorceress have
stopped us everytime we've tried.

10:20.892 --> 10:22.961
He-Man's gone,

10:22.961 --> 10:24.622
and as for the Sorceress...

10:24.696 --> 10:28.996
Not even she is strong enough
to resist the Dragon Pearl.

10:29.534 --> 10:34.267
Sorceress?
I will control Castle Grayskull.

10:35.340 --> 10:38.332
Stop me, if you dare.

10:44.149 --> 10:47.380
Your power is no match for mine, Skeletor.

10:51.423 --> 10:54.221
Go back to Snake Mountain, Skeletor.

10:54.292 --> 10:57.625
We have enough trouble
without you showing up.

10:57.963 --> 10:59.123
Trouble?

11:01.233 --> 11:03.724
I'll show you trouble, Sorceress!

11:09.608 --> 11:13.135
Evil-Lyn, focus your magic here.

11:13.578 --> 11:16.877
The Dragon Pearl will make
it a hundred times stronger.

11:23.088 --> 11:25.022
I... I must get help.

11:25.857 --> 11:26.983
He-Man!

11:29.661 --> 11:30.992
He-Man!

11:33.331 --> 11:35.925
He-Man, come to Grayskull.

11:37.903 --> 11:39.894
Come on, the Sorceress is calling.

11:40.438 --> 11:41.905
There's trouble at Grayskull.

11:58.523 --> 12:01.048
You trapped the
Sorceress in the Dragon Pearl.

12:21.112 --> 12:26.243
At last, Castle Grayskull and
all it's secrets are mine!

12:33.591 --> 12:36.458
He-Man will not set foot
in Grayskull again.

12:48.139 --> 12:50.539
What, in Eternia, is going on?

12:50.675 --> 12:53.075
Grayskull has fallen, He-Man.

12:53.712 --> 12:55.304
To me!

12:55.447 --> 12:57.415
The Sorceress is my prisoner...

12:57.415 --> 13:00.485
and with her power added to
the Dragon Pearl...

13:00.485 --> 13:03.943
all of Eternia will be mine!

13:26.678 --> 13:28.213
There's no science or sorcery...

13:28.213 --> 13:31.316
that's hot enough to burn
through that force field.

13:31.316 --> 13:32.476
It looks bad.

13:34.285 --> 13:37.345
When things look bad,
teamwork's the answer.

13:37.856 --> 13:40.450
Hey, thats it! I remember what Adam said.

13:40.525 --> 13:43.585
Maybe teamwork's the answer.

13:43.928 --> 13:45.030
That's it.

13:45.030 --> 13:47.265
Let's bring all the dragons here.

13:47.265 --> 13:49.067
But Beast Man controls them.

13:49.067 --> 13:51.297
Then we'll control Beast Man.

13:51.770 --> 13:52.964
C'mon.

14:00.111 --> 14:03.681
Are you sure the Sorceress cannot
escape from the Dragon Pearl?

14:03.681 --> 14:07.447
I transported the Dragon
Pearl, back to Snake Mountain.

14:07.685 --> 14:11.815
Away from Grayskull,
the Sorceress is powerless to resist.

14:12.190 --> 14:15.427
The Dragon Pearl is
draining away her magic.

14:15.427 --> 14:17.662
When it has it all...

14:17.662 --> 14:20.331
she will be part of the
Dragon Pearl forever.

14:20.331 --> 14:23.732
And her power will be mine!

14:33.044 --> 14:34.512
Snake Mountain.

14:34.512 --> 14:37.215
We may be playing right
into Skeletor's hands.

14:37.215 --> 14:38.850
Well, we'll have to chance it.

14:38.850 --> 14:41.478
This is our only hope to save Grayskull.

14:50.962 --> 14:53.231
This place gives me the creeps.

14:53.231 --> 14:55.199
Lets hope it also gives us Beast Man.

14:57.234 --> 15:00.397
You called, He-Man?

15:26.830 --> 15:30.061
I'll destroy you, He-Man.

15:39.644 --> 15:42.442
Stand back, He-Man!
This will quiet him down.

15:47.018 --> 15:50.215
Now, as for you, dragon.

15:53.658 --> 15:56.427
Looks like these dragons
aren't so bad after all,

15:56.427 --> 15:58.963
when Beast Man isn't controlling them.

15:58.963 --> 16:00.331
Take him back, Teela.

16:00.331 --> 16:02.100
We'll need all the
firepower we can get to...

16:02.100 --> 16:03.401
break through that force field.

16:03.401 --> 16:04.435
Where are you going?

16:04.435 --> 16:07.305
The mother dragon has to
be somewhere nearby.

16:07.305 --> 16:09.705
And I think we'll need her help.

16:11.843 --> 16:15.246
Stratos, all the dragons
have become friendly.

16:15.246 --> 16:18.383
I know, He-Man and Teela
must have found Beast Man.

16:18.383 --> 16:20.214
Let's get them to Grayskull.

16:29.160 --> 16:32.030
But how can the dragons
help us get into Grayskull?

16:32.030 --> 16:34.555
How else? Teamwork, remember.

16:34.899 --> 16:37.094
Fire when ready, dragons!

16:43.808 --> 16:44.934
It has to work.

16:51.015 --> 16:52.015
What?

16:53.351 --> 16:54.652
Orko was right.

16:54.652 --> 16:57.188
With the dragons working
together as a team...

16:57.188 --> 16:59.918
not even Skeletor's
forcefield could resist.

17:02.193 --> 17:03.455
Stop them!

17:11.202 --> 17:14.933
I won... I think.

17:20.511 --> 17:21.637
Skeletor!

17:21.878 --> 17:23.073
Not a chance.

17:35.660 --> 17:38.652
too bad about the others,
but at least I escaped.

17:39.030 --> 17:40.395
Not for long.

17:40.999 --> 17:42.933
You've had it, Skeletor.

17:43.134 --> 17:44.499
We'll see about that.

17:56.681 --> 17:58.716
I win, He-Man.

17:58.716 --> 18:01.708
Your Sorceress is trapped
inside the Dragon Pearl!

18:01.986 --> 18:04.386
Her power is now mine!

18:20.705 --> 18:21.899
Help!

18:22.807 --> 18:24.365
Hang on, Skeletor.

18:34.152 --> 18:37.610
He-Man, you're a fool.
You know I wouldn't have saved you.

18:37.989 --> 18:41.015
I guess I value life more than you
do, Skeletor.

18:41.192 --> 18:42.284
Even yours.

18:42.427 --> 18:44.292
Well, I value this.

18:44.462 --> 18:47.693
Take your last look.
You won't see it again.

18:49.267 --> 18:50.598
Oh no, no!

18:55.373 --> 18:57.308
Well, at least you'll never see...

18:57.308 --> 18:59.401
your precious Sorceress again.

19:32.310 --> 19:33.436
Thank you.

19:35.246 --> 19:37.111
Well, let's go home, Zoar.

19:43.488 --> 19:44.648
That's the last of them.

19:44.989 --> 19:47.325
They're on their way back to their mother.

19:47.325 --> 19:50.351
What happened to Evil-Lyn and
the rest of Skeletor's group?

19:50.762 --> 19:54.265
Evil-Lyn's magic was strong enough
to call up another space portal...

19:54.265 --> 19:55.698
they escaped through it.

19:55.900 --> 19:57.902
Well,
I can't say I'm sorry to see them go...

19:57.902 --> 20:00.438
but I have a feeling...

20:00.438 --> 20:02.269
they'll be back.

20:02.340 --> 20:04.242
You know,
one of those baby dragons...

20:04.242 --> 20:06.802
might have made a nice pet.

20:07.378 --> 20:09.505
Hey, I said might have.

20:10.047 --> 20:11.047
Hey, take it easy.

20:11.115 --> 20:12.275
Stop that.

20:12.350 --> 20:14.284
Oh, this is... embarrassing.

20:29.600 --> 20:32.803
In today's story,
Skeletor tried to conquer Eternia...

20:32.803 --> 20:34.839
by using animals in an evil way.

20:34.839 --> 20:36.540
Animals, like all living things...

20:36.540 --> 20:38.943
should be treated with
kindness and respect.

20:38.943 --> 20:41.445
I hope that those of you
who have a dog or cat...

20:41.445 --> 20:43.914
or maybe even a hamster, remember that.

20:43.914 --> 20:45.316
When we have a pet...

20:45.316 --> 20:46.884
we also have a responsibility...

20:46.884 --> 20:48.485
because they depend on us.

20:48.485 --> 20:50.554
But you can be sure of one thing...

20:50.554 --> 20:53.357
however much we love them,
they return that love,

20:53.357 --> 20:54.358
and more.

20:54.358 --> 20:56.193
Well, time for me to disappear.

20:56.193 --> 20:57.193
Bye!
