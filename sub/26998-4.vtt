WEBVTT

01:49.984 --> 01:52.570
No, no, no.
The Fly is about body dysmorphia.

01:52.862 --> 01:54.823
Isn't it about a guy
who turns into a giant fly?

01:55.156 --> 01:59.661
The original, yes, but Cronenberg said
his remake was a metaphor for STDs.

01:59.744 --> 02:03.164
-Yeah.
-Guys, what are we doing this weekend?

02:03.540 --> 02:05.959
Well, my dad is going
to the Farm Expo for three days,

02:06.042 --> 02:08.586
-so I'm stuck at home by myself.
-Ooh!

02:08.670 --> 02:10.004
Let's have a girls' night.

02:10.088 --> 02:12.757
-Uh...
-C'mon, Susie, please?

02:13.133 --> 02:16.469
My mom and dad are trying to get me
to lead this youth group

02:16.553 --> 02:18.012
at their church this weekend.

02:18.179 --> 02:21.015
Staying with you would give me
the perfect excuse not to do that.

02:21.099 --> 02:22.267
I dunno, Roz.

02:22.350 --> 02:23.685
'Brina, you in?

02:23.768 --> 02:26.604
Actually, I'll be at the expo too
this weekend.

02:26.688 --> 02:28.398
I'm helping my Aunt Hilda sell her honey.

02:28.481 --> 02:30.733
Wait, you're not gonna be gone
the entire expo, are you?

02:30.942 --> 02:31.901
Yeah, I am.

02:33.111 --> 02:35.155
But I have a coping strategy.

02:35.655 --> 02:39.284
Whenever I'm really missing you,
I'll hold you close to my heart.

02:39.367 --> 02:41.411
Call me the second you get back.
I'll come right over.

02:44.622 --> 02:47.458
Uh... Relax, Romeo, it's three days.

02:47.750 --> 02:51.421
Yeah. I mean, seriously, you guys.
Seriously, you guys!

02:56.217 --> 02:58.344
Aren't you even a little excited?

02:58.428 --> 03:00.013
I'm stressed, Ambrose.

03:00.096 --> 03:02.140
Starting a new school is stressful.

03:02.432 --> 03:06.227
Not to mention I'm lying
to Harvey and Roz and Susie.

03:06.769 --> 03:10.315
And I don't see why I have to be
at the academy for three whole nights.

03:10.398 --> 03:11.900
It's your induction.

03:12.192 --> 03:15.862
Cousin, you are on the precipice
of a stupendous new adventure

03:15.945 --> 03:17.405
at the Academy of Unseen Arts.

03:17.488 --> 03:21.701
You will meet interesting witches
and warlocks from all over the world.

03:21.784 --> 03:24.996
Some of them,
a great many of them, will be hot.

03:25.079 --> 03:28.833
Ambrose, I'm not going to the academy
to hook up with hot warlocks.

03:28.917 --> 03:32.170
I am going to the academy
to learn how to defeat the Dark Lord.

03:33.713 --> 03:37.926
I'm going to learn how to conjure him,
bind him, banish him.

03:38.551 --> 03:41.054
That's my only agenda.

03:45.433 --> 03:48.269
Okay. Before I forget,
I have made you these.

03:49.020 --> 03:52.815
Ooh! They're to take to the academy.
Keep in your little pockets.

03:52.899 --> 03:56.694
-Protection charms.
-Honestly, Hilda, what next?

03:56.986 --> 03:58.571
Crystals

03:58.655 --> 04:02.200
I was concerned, Zelda,
that she was gonna get bullied.

04:02.283 --> 04:05.119
You know how cruel girls can be
at that or any age.

04:05.203 --> 04:08.790
Don't worry about me, Aunt Hilda.
I can take care of myself.

04:08.873 --> 04:11.876
I know. Ooh!
What if you take Salem in with you?

04:12.168 --> 04:13.795
Or we could teleport him to you.

04:14.045 --> 04:15.004
Nonsense.

04:15.421 --> 04:18.675
Only babies and ninnies
take their familiars to school.

04:20.468 --> 04:22.512
Remember when you tried
to bring your spiders?

04:23.179 --> 04:25.974
How all the other students laughed
and called you names?

04:26.057 --> 04:28.685
Yes. I remember one in particular.

04:28.768 --> 04:33.147
My years at the academy
were amongst the happiest of my life.

04:33.773 --> 04:36.985
The books I read,
the friendships I cultivated.

04:37.068 --> 04:40.363
It was like being part
of the most marvelous salon,

04:40.446 --> 04:43.157
arguing about ideas, philosophy.

04:43.241 --> 04:45.368
Your father and I would get
into such debates.

04:45.451 --> 04:48.621
Hmm, really? Because you seemed to be
on the same page about signing my name

04:48.705 --> 04:49.872
in the Book of the Beast.

04:50.206 --> 04:52.583
Eat up and then I'll get my coat
and drive you.

04:52.667 --> 04:54.002
Absolutely not, Hilda.

04:54.085 --> 04:54.961
Hmm?

04:55.169 --> 04:57.380
You've been excommunicated,
or had you forgotten?

04:57.463 --> 05:00.383
Oh, how could I forget when you're
reminding me every other minute?

05:00.466 --> 05:03.720
As a consequence, you're not allowed
within spitting distance of the academy

05:03.803 --> 05:06.514
or any other Church of Night property,
for that matter.

05:06.597 --> 05:10.393
Well, I can give my niece a bloody hug
before she goes, can't I?

05:36.836 --> 05:38.755
Pardon me, Miss. Are you Sabrina?

05:40.298 --> 05:41.132
I am.

05:41.299 --> 05:44.510
I'm Quentin. We've been expecting you.
This way, please.

05:48.389 --> 05:49.349
Are you a student here?

05:49.599 --> 05:52.643
Oh, of course, Miss. I'm here to show you
to Father Blackwood's office.

06:00.818 --> 06:04.238
The academy was built according
to the principles of sacred geometry.

06:04.530 --> 06:07.283
Each room
is a perfectly proportioned pentagon

06:07.367 --> 06:09.160
that locks with the one next to it.

06:09.911 --> 06:12.413
No one knows
how many pentagons there are, exactly.

06:12.789 --> 06:14.374
Some say an infinite number.

06:29.222 --> 06:32.308
Welcome to
the Academy of Unseen Arts, Miss Spellman.

06:32.392 --> 06:37.522
I recognize that there's been a bit of...
unpleasantness between us,

06:37.605 --> 06:41.275
but that's only because
we so desperately wanted to get you here.

06:43.152 --> 06:44.570
I've prepared your schedule.

06:51.619 --> 06:54.247
Um...

06:57.708 --> 07:00.586
Yes

07:01.295 --> 07:02.338
Binding rituals?

07:02.422 --> 07:03.423
Demonology?

07:05.925 --> 07:08.928
You have to fulfill
the academy's general requirements first.

07:09.011 --> 07:12.849
Just now, I believe,
you are due at choir practice.

07:24.819 --> 07:28.406
Forgive the interruption, my dear,
but I have an addition to your ranks.

07:28.614 --> 07:31.200
Sabrina Spellman, my wife, Lady Blackwood.

07:31.826 --> 07:35.621
I've heard a lot about you, Sabrina.
We've all heard a lot about you.

07:37.248 --> 07:38.249
Welcome.

07:38.749 --> 07:41.377
I'll leave Miss Spellman
in your capable hands, then.

07:49.260 --> 07:52.388
Now, Sabrina, can you sight read music?

07:53.222 --> 07:55.475
Just a verse or two,
so I know where to place you.

08:29.592 --> 08:30.593
My, my.

08:32.386 --> 08:33.262
Prudence.

08:34.347 --> 08:37.808
I do believe
you have some competition, finally.

08:43.689 --> 08:47.485
Hi. I'm Nicholas Scratch. Nick Scratch.

08:48.402 --> 08:49.403
Mind if I join you?

08:49.946 --> 08:51.447
Sure. Sure.

08:51.989 --> 08:53.574
-I'm Sabrina.
-Spellman.

08:54.242 --> 08:55.952
You're Edward Spellman's daughter.

08:56.452 --> 08:57.328
I am.

08:58.871 --> 09:00.331
Your reputation precedes you.

09:01.332 --> 09:04.919
Your father's as well.
I'm, uh, reading his journals right now.

09:05.127 --> 09:07.296
You are

09:07.380 --> 09:09.090
I don't. Not personally.

09:09.715 --> 09:12.635
They're in the Sanctum,
the library for advanced students,

09:12.718 --> 09:13.761
under lock and key.

09:13.844 --> 09:16.389
Cassius, the librarian,
brings them out to you, one by one,

09:16.472 --> 09:18.849
but you can't even take notes
while reading them.

09:19.100 --> 09:22.103
-Why not?
-They're considered dangerous texts.

09:23.813 --> 09:27.149
Your father was a controversial figure
in the witch community.

09:28.526 --> 09:31.362
But why am I telling you that

09:32.572 --> 09:34.532
And some of his more radical ideas.

09:35.908 --> 09:39.245
Radical to others, by the way,
I personally think he was brilliant.

09:39.412 --> 09:40.621
Ahead of his time.

09:41.581 --> 09:44.166
The greatest conjurer
the Church of Night has ever produced.

09:44.250 --> 09:47.003
Is that what you're studying
at the academy

09:47.628 --> 09:50.923
Conjuration. Demonology.
Invocation. Ritual magic.

09:51.215 --> 09:53.926
-Necromancy, but that's hush-hush.
-Oh, wow.

09:54.010 --> 09:55.386
-It's fun?
-Yeah.

09:55.469 --> 09:59.640
Sabrina, Nicholas,
we're not interrupting, are we?

10:00.850 --> 10:03.436
No, not at all. Join us, please.

10:09.817 --> 10:13.154
Well, Sabrina,
how are you enjoying the academy so far?

10:13.237 --> 10:14.822
Is it like your other school?

10:14.905 --> 10:16.699
Uh, Baxter High?

10:17.074 --> 10:20.036
-No. Not really.
-You know what we heard?

10:20.119 --> 10:22.079
We heard you didn't want
to take your Dark Baptism

10:22.163 --> 10:24.457
because you were in love
with some mortal boy.

10:24.915 --> 10:26.792
Must be some Spellman kink, hmm?

10:26.876 --> 10:28.461
Slumming with mortals?

10:28.961 --> 10:30.713
Like father, like daughter, right?

10:32.506 --> 10:35.968
Careful, Nicky, or she'll cocktease you
the way she did the Dark Lord.

10:36.052 --> 10:38.387
Why do you have to be
such a bitch all the time, Pru?

10:38.471 --> 10:41.891
I don't know, Nicky. Why do you have to be
such a warlock-slut all the time?

10:45.645 --> 10:48.314
What's your next class

10:49.023 --> 10:49.857
Sure.

10:53.778 --> 10:55.446
See you later, ladies.

10:56.322 --> 10:59.241
Oh, don't worry... we will.

11:14.799 --> 11:16.509
I love these old movies.

11:18.094 --> 11:20.763
-What's this one called again?
-Carnival of Souls.

11:20.846 --> 11:22.807
-Hmm.
-It was filmed in Salt Lake City.

11:25.017 --> 11:26.352
What was that?

11:27.311 --> 11:28.270
Roz.

11:28.354 --> 11:29.855
Is there someone else
in the house with us?

11:29.939 --> 11:32.608
-I tried to tell you.
-Tell me what?

11:33.901 --> 11:35.069
It's my uncle.

11:35.820 --> 11:39.740
He's really sick.
He rings the bell when he needs something.

11:41.575 --> 11:43.285
I should probably go check on him.

11:44.078 --> 11:45.830
I'm obviously coming with you.

12:18.863 --> 12:19.989
Oh, my God.

12:21.741 --> 12:22.867
What happened to him?

12:24.618 --> 12:26.829
Uncle Jesse got sick...

12:27.538 --> 12:30.040
working in the mines for Harvey's dad.

12:30.750 --> 12:33.002
One day, he just went crazy down there.
He...

12:34.336 --> 12:36.881
He said he saw something.

12:37.757 --> 12:38.716
Some...

12:40.176 --> 12:41.010
monster.

12:42.052 --> 12:43.888
He's never been the same.

12:43.971 --> 12:47.057
My dad and I take care of him
and make sure he gets his medicine, but...

12:47.141 --> 12:50.102
most of the time, he's sedated, quiet,

12:50.186 --> 12:53.606
but... every so often, like...

12:54.982 --> 12:56.066
since the eclipse--

12:56.150 --> 12:58.235
And your dad just leaves you
alone with him?

12:58.319 --> 12:59.987
I told him it would be okay,

13:00.070 --> 13:02.740
that I was ready
for the responsibility, but...

13:04.867 --> 13:05.910
Are you?

13:06.869 --> 13:08.162
I don't know.

13:09.830 --> 13:12.500
But if I keep the door to his room locked,

13:13.125 --> 13:15.127
will you stay with me
the rest of the weekend?

14:01.090 --> 14:04.260
Don't show them you're scared,
or they'll kill you on the spot.

14:11.851 --> 14:12.685
Wait...

14:14.562 --> 14:15.396
Where am I?

14:22.528 --> 14:23.904
You're in the Witch's Cell.

14:24.822 --> 14:26.740
Where the Greendale Thirteen were held.

14:27.074 --> 14:28.534
What is this, Prudence?

14:28.617 --> 14:30.452
This is the Harrowing.

14:31.078 --> 14:32.371
It's a witch tradition.

14:33.372 --> 14:36.667
You have to be able to endure
what those earliest Greendale witches did.

14:37.543 --> 14:41.630
Thirteen made it to the noose,
but many more perished in here.

14:42.590 --> 14:45.634
This place winnowed them.

14:46.260 --> 14:49.179
No sunlight, no water, no food.

14:49.555 --> 14:50.890
Wallowing in their own filth,

14:50.973 --> 14:53.642
most witches went mad
and cut their own throats.

14:53.851 --> 14:55.394
They haunt this place still.

14:55.477 --> 14:57.897
They'll show you terrible things
in the dark.

14:57.980 --> 15:00.357
Things that will make you go insane.

15:00.900 --> 15:02.318
But you're a Spellman.

15:03.027 --> 15:05.112
A daughter of a High Priest.

15:05.404 --> 15:06.989
You're not scared of the dark.

15:07.448 --> 15:08.616
You can take it.

15:09.408 --> 15:12.745
Unless, of course... you lose your head.

15:23.172 --> 15:24.298
No, please!

16:06.507 --> 16:09.134
Help!

16:40.207 --> 16:43.752
Well, looks like the cell's claimed
another victim.

16:44.044 --> 16:46.714
-The poor girl's lost her mind.
-She's gibbering like a loon.

16:46.797 --> 16:48.048
It's a pretty sound, isn't it?

16:48.507 --> 16:50.217
Like waves on a beach.

16:54.013 --> 16:55.347
Oh, it wasn't so bad in the end.

16:55.723 --> 16:58.517
This is Salem, by the way.

16:59.226 --> 17:01.520
He protects and comforts me,
wherever I am.

17:01.812 --> 17:02.980
He's very clever.

17:03.272 --> 17:06.400
In goblin form, there isn't a crack
he can't squeeze through.

17:08.235 --> 17:09.194
Bye, girls.

17:12.239 --> 17:14.366
Hey, you're up early.

17:14.450 --> 17:16.326
I didn't ever go to sleep, Harvey.

17:16.744 --> 17:20.456
What, did you and your Aunt Hilda go out
partying with a bunch of farmers?

17:20.956 --> 17:22.166
Not exactly.

17:23.959 --> 17:25.085
I hate it here.

17:25.335 --> 17:26.670
You hate the expo?

17:28.005 --> 17:30.132
-Come home, then.
-No.

17:30.924 --> 17:31.842
I can't.

17:32.634 --> 17:35.054
I have to see it through.

17:35.137 --> 17:36.055
Really?

17:36.930 --> 17:39.683
Man, I guess I didn't realize
how intense these expos were.

17:39.767 --> 17:40.684
They are.

17:42.770 --> 17:43.979
But this is helping.

17:45.022 --> 17:47.149
-What?
-Hearing your voice.

17:47.775 --> 17:48.650
Oh, yeah?

17:49.735 --> 17:51.987
-It's not even my sexy voice.

17:53.572 --> 17:59.078
Keep talking, Harvey Kinkle,
just... keep talking.

18:04.041 --> 18:04.875
Salem?

18:05.959 --> 18:07.294
Has anyone seen--

18:12.633 --> 18:13.592
Give them back.

18:14.009 --> 18:15.385
Whatever are you talking about?

18:15.469 --> 18:18.305
My cat. Who was sitting on my pajamas.

18:18.388 --> 18:20.224
What cat

18:23.310 --> 18:25.437
They were on my bed,
now they're both gone.

18:25.521 --> 18:26.438
They are?

18:26.522 --> 18:27.523
Oh, dear.

18:33.153 --> 18:35.072
I know you took them.

18:35.155 --> 18:36.156
How bad do you want them?

18:36.240 --> 18:37.658
Give them back to me!

18:37.741 --> 18:39.743
Fight! Fight! Fight!

18:41.870 --> 18:42.788
Miss Spellman.

18:44.248 --> 18:47.251
Get dressed at once,
and then to my office.

19:02.266 --> 19:05.310
Firstly, familiars are not permitted
at the academy.

19:05.394 --> 19:07.646
-Salem will have to go home with Zelda.

19:07.729 --> 19:11.775
Secondly, and I feel I must ask this,
are you happy here, Sabrina?

19:11.859 --> 19:13.235
Of course she is, Faustus.

19:13.318 --> 19:16.405
Picking fights with other students.
Complaining about your schedule.

19:16.488 --> 19:17.614
What's this now?

19:17.698 --> 19:21.702
I didn't come here to major in herbalism,
or Latin, Aunt Zelda.

19:21.785 --> 19:23.245
Well, of course you didn't.

19:23.579 --> 19:27.249
If this is what you've got her studying,
it's no wonder she's feeling restless.

19:27.332 --> 19:28.625
She's not being challenged.

19:28.709 --> 19:31.336
I told Father Blackwood
I wanted to study conjuring.

19:31.628 --> 19:32.462
Like my father.

19:32.546 --> 19:35.132
Zelda, I can't put her in conjuring
without being sure she's ready.

19:35.465 --> 19:36.758
It wouldn't be safe.

19:36.842 --> 19:38.552
For her or the other students.

19:38.635 --> 19:39.887
Then test her.

20:04.036 --> 20:04.912
What is it?

20:05.746 --> 20:08.457
It's an Acheron Configuration,
if I'm not mistaken.

20:08.540 --> 20:09.833
An arcane puzzle.

20:09.917 --> 20:12.461
A variation on it, yes.

20:12.794 --> 20:15.881
It's a test of mental
and actual dexterity.

20:26.808 --> 20:29.102
Solve it, and you can join
conjuring class.

20:29.895 --> 20:32.981
-Or go mad trying.
-That won't happen with your niece.

20:33.065 --> 20:36.652
Only the weak-willed fall prey
to the Acheron's fascinations.

20:36.735 --> 20:37.694
Quite right.

20:38.028 --> 20:40.489
Sabrina will prove herself
her father's daughter.

20:41.907 --> 20:44.910
I had forgotten how fiercely maternal
you can be, Zelda.

20:45.786 --> 20:49.373
There's a personal matter
I'd like to discuss with you in private,

20:49.456 --> 20:51.959
-if your niece will excuse us.
-Of course she will.

20:52.793 --> 20:53.835
And Sabrina...

20:55.379 --> 20:56.255
behave.

20:57.422 --> 21:01.093
I will, Aunt Zelda.
Even though I'm still missing my pajamas.

21:09.768 --> 21:13.981
Zelda, Lady Blackwood
has miscarried twice before.

21:14.398 --> 21:16.066
This distresses us gravely.

21:16.525 --> 21:20.529
But now that I sit here with you,
I feel... comfort.

21:22.614 --> 21:23.782
Sister Spellman...

21:26.660 --> 21:28.704
would you be a midwife to her?

21:32.791 --> 21:33.625
To Constance?

21:35.836 --> 21:39.214
Faustus, it's been years
since I've delivered a child.

21:39.298 --> 21:42.968
If I remember correctly,
you've never lost a babe, not once.

21:43.385 --> 21:45.512
Please, Zelda.

21:45.971 --> 21:47.597
Your High Priest is asking you.

22:01.028 --> 22:02.237
Hi, there.

22:02.738 --> 22:03.572
Hey.

22:04.740 --> 22:06.575
So I heard you got into a fight
with Prudence.

22:06.658 --> 22:07.993
-I did.
-I'll talk to her.

22:08.076 --> 22:10.537
Please don't.
That will only make her hate me more.

22:11.413 --> 22:14.249
So, did you guys date?

22:15.292 --> 22:18.003
For a short period of time, yeah.

22:18.378 --> 22:20.797
Yeah, I was involved with the sisters.

22:22.007 --> 22:22.966
All three of them?

22:24.134 --> 22:25.218
All at once?

22:26.011 --> 22:28.847
-What happened?
-Their gifts include mind control.

22:29.473 --> 22:33.435
I wasn't sure what was real
and what was... suggestion.

22:34.603 --> 22:36.772
What are you doing with
an Acheron Configuration?

22:36.897 --> 22:38.023
Blackwood gave it to me.

22:38.106 --> 22:41.151
Says that as soon as I solve it,
I get to take conjuring classes.

22:41.234 --> 22:42.069
Hmm.

22:43.111 --> 22:45.447
-Okay.
-What

22:46.823 --> 22:49.576
That particular configuration
was your father's thesis.

22:49.910 --> 22:51.244
He designed and built it.

22:51.328 --> 22:52.245
My father did?

22:52.579 --> 22:56.541
Yeah. Blackwood's been trying
to solve this damn thing for 20 years.

22:56.625 --> 22:58.960
I tried for three. Gave up.

22:59.044 --> 23:02.130
See, the configuration's
almost like a kaleidoscope.

23:02.923 --> 23:04.299
Its colors and patterns are...

23:07.469 --> 23:08.637
addictive, and...

23:09.137 --> 23:11.848
the more you stare at it,
the harder it is to solve.

23:11.932 --> 23:14.226
If you're not careful,
it can mess with your head.

23:15.060 --> 23:16.353
You can get lost in it.

23:16.686 --> 23:17.521
Wonderful.

23:17.604 --> 23:21.358
Due respect, Sabrina,
you're never going to be able to do it.

23:21.441 --> 23:25.445
If my father made it, then he probably
wrote about it in his journals, right?

23:26.279 --> 23:29.324
Nothing explicit.
Nothing I've come across.

23:29.408 --> 23:31.201
Yes, but you're not a Spellman.

23:31.785 --> 23:34.579
Sneak me into the library,
get me access to his journals.

23:34.663 --> 23:37.416
What you're asking is impossible. Okay?

23:37.499 --> 23:41.670
I mean, if we got caught, and we would,
we'd both be expelled from the academy.

23:42.045 --> 23:43.422
I doubt I'd be expelled.

23:43.630 --> 23:46.174
They'd probably just extend
my immersion indefinitely.

23:48.218 --> 23:52.222
Would that be such a bad thing

23:55.809 --> 23:56.643
I should go.

24:04.985 --> 24:07.737
Hey, Roz. What's up - Um...

24:09.698 --> 24:11.700
Did you ever meet her Uncle Jesse?

24:12.325 --> 24:14.619
I think so.
He moved away a while back, right?

24:15.120 --> 24:18.790
No. He's still living with them
at the farm. He's, like, really sick.

24:19.416 --> 24:21.918
Susie said he saw something
down in the mines and it...

24:22.002 --> 24:24.379
seriously messed him up.

24:26.631 --> 24:27.507
In the mines?

24:39.311 --> 24:40.812
Spellman Sisters Mortuary.

24:42.689 --> 24:43.607
Hello?

24:45.150 --> 24:46.359
Speaking. Who's this?

24:49.196 --> 24:50.197
Luke.

24:51.114 --> 24:53.033
Of course I remember. Yeah.

24:53.408 --> 24:54.618
I've met someone, Auntie.

24:54.701 --> 24:55.744
Hmm?

24:56.244 --> 24:58.079
He's asked
if I'd like to go on a date with him.

24:58.663 --> 24:59.498
Oh.

25:00.916 --> 25:04.169
So I was going to astral project
to a coffee shop, with your help.

25:06.254 --> 25:07.506
That's risky.

25:09.216 --> 25:11.468
Also, you wouldn't be able
to touch him, love.

25:11.760 --> 25:13.970
No... but we could...

25:15.347 --> 25:16.223
see each other.

25:16.723 --> 25:18.517
Have a conversation, face to face.

25:18.600 --> 25:19.809
I like him, Auntie.

25:20.519 --> 25:21.561
Mmm.

25:21.978 --> 25:23.230
I-- I know.

25:23.730 --> 25:27.317
I'm sorry, hon, but it's just--
it's too dangerous.

25:28.944 --> 25:30.779
Auntie Zee projects all the time.

25:31.446 --> 25:34.157
And with you guarding my body,
I'll be perfectly safe.

25:34.533 --> 25:37.035
Only the dead are allowed
to travel the astral plane.

25:38.036 --> 25:41.623
You spend enough time out there,
and the psychopomps will find you.

25:42.749 --> 25:47.003
They will assume you're dead.
They will carry you off to the hereafter,

25:47.087 --> 25:50.632
or... they will tattle
to the Dweller in the Abyss.

25:52.509 --> 25:55.220
They may look like
sweet little sparrows,

25:55.303 --> 25:56.763
but they are in fact vicious,

25:56.846 --> 26:00.892
spiteful, hateful creatures,
much like sisters.

26:07.315 --> 26:10.026
First sign of a psychopomp,
and I'm out of there.

26:10.193 --> 26:12.612
-Swear on Satan's claw.
-Can't do it.

26:14.239 --> 26:18.952
Hey, besides the psychopomps
and the Dweller, Zelda--

26:19.035 --> 26:22.122
Thought my ears were burning.

26:23.290 --> 26:24.666
What are you two plotting?

26:25.208 --> 26:26.376
We're not, we're just--

26:26.459 --> 26:29.879
Just wondering
where you're going so smart.

26:29.963 --> 26:30.797
So smart.

26:31.673 --> 26:34.676
I've been invited
to the High Priest's house to sup.

26:35.218 --> 26:37.429
With your medical bag?

26:37.512 --> 26:39.097
-Shut up, Hilda.

26:39.180 --> 26:41.266
-What?
-You are persona non grata.

26:41.349 --> 26:43.435
Dinner with the High Priest
is a great honor.

26:43.518 --> 26:45.228
One you'll never again enjoy.

26:46.062 --> 26:50.317
You two will have to fend
for yourselves tonight, I'm afraid.

26:56.698 --> 27:00.327
We'll need candles, the address
of the coffee shop, and a map.

27:00.410 --> 27:03.038
-Mm-hmm.
-We do it in the embalming room.

27:08.710 --> 27:11.379
Yes, Prudence.

27:11.838 --> 27:15.258
This creature was spying on us
in the girls' showers.

27:15.842 --> 27:18.595
It's clearly someone's familiar,
but do you know whose?

27:20.388 --> 27:23.308
Yes. Leave it with me,
I'll see that it's dealt with.

27:31.358 --> 27:32.734
Shall I kill the raven?

27:33.985 --> 27:36.196
Or will you take it and yourself away?

27:40.533 --> 27:44.371
-Stolas doesn't like being caged.
-Then keep him out of my academy.

27:44.454 --> 27:47.207
The Dark Lord asked me
to watch over Sabrina.

27:47.290 --> 27:49.084
Where she goes, I follow.

27:49.584 --> 27:52.420
Not this weekend.
The academy is my purview.

27:53.922 --> 27:55.632
Why don't you shift your focus?

27:55.840 --> 28:00.512
I don't need you to tell me my business.

28:01.596 --> 28:04.099
I am merely pointing out
that with Sabrina away,

28:04.182 --> 28:05.725
her chums will be vulnerable.

28:06.476 --> 28:07.352
Her aunties, too.

28:09.145 --> 28:12.065
And that you might have some fun,
Ms. Wardwell.

28:17.987 --> 28:20.073
All right. Right-o.

28:20.156 --> 28:21.866
-You've got 20 minutes.
-Thirty.

28:22.117 --> 28:24.494
-Twenty. Then I'm pulling you back.

28:28.957 --> 28:30.709
Vola anima per aeterna.

28:30.792 --> 28:32.419
Vola anima per aeterna.

28:32.502 --> 28:34.087
Vola anima per aeterna.

28:34.170 --> 28:35.755
Vola anima per aeterna.

28:43.763 --> 28:44.597
Ambrose?

28:54.023 --> 28:55.066
Um...

28:59.362 --> 29:03.366
We don't usually take walk-ins.
It's not that kind of, uh...

29:03.450 --> 29:06.202
not that kind of business. Sorry, can I help you?

29:06.369 --> 29:09.706
I'd, uh... I'd like to make
some funeral arrangements.

29:09.914 --> 29:12.208
Right. If you'd like to take a seat,

29:12.292 --> 29:15.837
maybe, in there? There's a catalog
you can have a little look through.

29:15.920 --> 29:19.174
-Catalog?
-Yes. I have to pop to the, um--

29:19.257 --> 29:21.009
I'll just be like ten minutes.

29:52.123 --> 29:53.416
-Hey, there.
-Hi.

29:57.796 --> 30:00.256
So, do you, uh...
Do you come here a lot?

30:01.925 --> 30:04.969
Not a lot, no.
I definitely would not say a lot.

30:05.053 --> 30:07.388
Yeah, it's pretty kitschy.

30:08.765 --> 30:11.017
-So what are your usual haunts?
-I, uh...

30:13.269 --> 30:15.605
I'm more a homebody, myself.

30:16.314 --> 30:17.273
How about you?

30:22.487 --> 30:25.031
Don't be dead. Don't be dead.

30:25.740 --> 30:26.658
Okay.

30:27.992 --> 30:28.910
Ambrose.

30:37.919 --> 30:40.713
Hurry up. Hurry up, lad, come on.

30:47.345 --> 30:49.389
I spoke to Connor's father yesterday.

30:49.556 --> 30:51.724
There was some paperwork
he had to finish up.

30:51.808 --> 30:54.102
The police are still looking
for Connor's killer,

30:54.185 --> 30:57.564
-but they're not having much luck.
-You know, Ambrose, not to be harsh,

30:57.647 --> 31:00.525
but I didn't call you
so we could talk about Connor.

31:01.860 --> 31:04.237
-I called to get to know you better.
-Of course.

31:04.320 --> 31:07.657
Yeah. Because that's what people do. Um--

31:08.199 --> 31:09.742
I'm sorry, I'm a bit out of practice.

31:10.368 --> 31:12.120
What's the craziest thing
you've ever done?

31:12.203 --> 31:13.705
Wow...

31:13.788 --> 31:15.748
...you're going right to it.

31:15.832 --> 31:17.500
Yeah. Right to the meat of it.

31:21.754 --> 31:23.464
I'm not proud of it, but...

31:24.132 --> 31:26.759
I was arrested for attempting
to blow up the Vatican.

31:32.056 --> 31:33.057
But--

31:33.349 --> 31:35.059
Wait, are you serious?

31:36.144 --> 31:37.228
Mm-hmm.

32:43.252 --> 32:44.671
Oh, no.

32:44.754 --> 32:46.089
Oh, yes.

32:46.297 --> 32:49.968
Guys, please.
We have no reason to hate each other.

32:50.051 --> 32:53.471
Wrong.
We have plenty of reasons to hate you.

32:54.222 --> 32:56.432
Your father betrayed his own kind
to marry a mortal.

32:56.641 --> 32:59.435
You'll betray us the first chance you get.

32:59.519 --> 33:01.854
If you survive the Harrowing.

33:02.021 --> 33:02.855
Wh--

33:05.149 --> 33:08.111
But I already did survive. Last night.

33:08.194 --> 33:10.071
That was only the beginning.

33:11.364 --> 33:12.407
I'll scream.

33:12.490 --> 33:16.077
You think anyone here will help you?
They hate you.

33:16.369 --> 33:17.954
Scream as much as you'd like,

33:18.037 --> 33:20.790
it'll just be 20 girls harrowing you
instead of three.

33:28.339 --> 33:30.258
Excuse me, may I help you?

33:30.466 --> 33:31.759
So sorry.

33:32.510 --> 33:36.431
I was looking for the powder room
and that lovely little English lady

33:36.681 --> 33:38.641
that told me to wait
has been gone for so long--

33:38.725 --> 33:40.018
And you are?

33:41.561 --> 33:43.312
Ms. Wardwell.

33:44.147 --> 33:46.899
I'm one of Sabrina's teachers, but...

33:48.109 --> 33:49.944
I came here to make
some funeral arrangements.

33:50.028 --> 33:51.070
I see.

33:51.529 --> 33:54.949
And the woman you spoke to

33:56.034 --> 33:58.703
The basement, I believe. Yes.

34:00.663 --> 34:01.956
I shall be on my way.

34:09.881 --> 34:12.759
Hilda, what game are you playing at?

34:14.886 --> 34:16.304
You nervous, Ambrose?

34:17.430 --> 34:19.807
Nervous? -

34:20.433 --> 34:24.020
How-- How do you mean - You haven't touched your drink,

34:24.103 --> 34:26.898
and you keep looking out the window
as if you're expecting someone.

34:29.108 --> 34:30.568
I thought I'd have more time.

34:32.278 --> 34:33.488
-I have to go, Luke.
-What?

34:33.571 --> 34:36.991
I'm sorry, this-- this was a mistake.

34:37.075 --> 34:38.326
-Ambrose, wait.
-Ambrose.

34:38.868 --> 34:41.204
Hilda, where are you -Zelda.

34:43.372 --> 34:44.832
Dear Satan!

34:52.965 --> 34:56.260
Have you two completely taken leave
of your senses?

34:56.344 --> 34:59.180
Astral projection? Of all the stupid,
reckless things you could do.

34:59.263 --> 35:00.431
It was well in hand.

35:00.515 --> 35:04.602
You left a client alone, upstairs,
which is totally unprofessional, Hilda.

35:04.685 --> 35:08.439
And Ambrose, my dear felon,
you are housebound.

35:08.523 --> 35:12.652
You're forbidden from leaving the grounds,
and that includes your spirit.

35:27.917 --> 35:30.294
This is the same path
the Greendale Thirteen,

35:30.962 --> 35:35.383
who'd survived torture and imprisonment,
walked to the noose.

35:35.842 --> 35:39.345
They kept their eyes straight ahead,
fixed on the path.

35:39.846 --> 35:41.931
Mortals surrounded them on either side,

35:42.265 --> 35:45.226
and if any witch lifted their eyes
to meet a human's gaze...

35:45.309 --> 35:47.770
They were stoned to death on the spot.

36:27.810 --> 36:28.686
What...

36:30.354 --> 36:31.606
What do I do now?

36:32.273 --> 36:35.318
You do exactly what the original 13 did.

36:36.068 --> 36:40.031
You stand in the wet, cold night.

36:41.699 --> 36:42.783
Exposed.

36:43.367 --> 36:44.577
Without shoes.

36:44.660 --> 36:45.953
Without rest.

36:46.871 --> 36:51.042
And you don't turn around,
no matter what you hear.

36:52.543 --> 36:53.711
For how long?

36:53.920 --> 36:55.296
Until dawn.

36:58.591 --> 37:02.053
And if I turn around, what happens?

37:26.994 --> 37:30.331
'Brina. Help me. These girls--

37:32.041 --> 37:33.459
You're not really Harvey.

37:33.542 --> 37:36.003
What? Of course it's me, Sabrina.

37:36.087 --> 37:37.672
Please. Please turn around.

37:42.134 --> 37:43.844
Oh, God, please, no.

37:53.813 --> 37:56.023
Sabrina, it's your mother.

37:56.107 --> 37:56.983
No.

37:57.441 --> 37:58.484
You're a thing.

37:59.777 --> 38:04.448
A sending or a-- a demon,
but you're not my mother.

38:04.865 --> 38:07.702
Let me look at you, your face.

38:07.868 --> 38:09.704
Just once, Sabrina, please.

38:09.787 --> 38:11.497
Go away.

38:12.248 --> 38:13.874
Begone, demon.

38:21.716 --> 38:24.927
Sabrina,
that's no way to speak to your mother.

38:25.011 --> 38:26.178
Apologize.

38:27.054 --> 38:27.888
Dad?

38:29.849 --> 38:30.808
Daddy?

38:31.767 --> 38:34.979
My brave
young girl, why won't you look at me?

38:35.062 --> 38:36.939
I... I...

38:37.106 --> 38:40.651
Just a quick peek, my darling.

38:41.068 --> 38:43.529
My light, my life.

38:43.696 --> 38:45.031
Please stop.

38:45.531 --> 38:48.284
One tiny glance and you'll see.

38:49.035 --> 38:52.705
It will all be over.

39:19.690 --> 39:20.858
It's morning, Miss.

39:21.525 --> 39:24.403
You've passed their test.
You can come back to school now.

39:41.170 --> 39:43.923
Quentin, you shouldn't be out here alone.

39:44.090 --> 39:45.383
These woods aren't safe.

39:46.300 --> 39:48.677
There's nothing out here
that can hurt me anymore.

39:49.011 --> 39:50.346
Come, I'll show you.

40:10.157 --> 40:11.075
What?

40:19.208 --> 40:21.752
There used to be a groundskeeper
who buried us...

40:23.045 --> 40:24.547
but he died many years ago.

40:28.592 --> 40:29.927
Would you like to meet the others?

40:48.112 --> 40:50.030
Oh, Quentin.

41:06.088 --> 41:08.215
Spellman Sisters Mortuary,
how may I assist you?

41:08.799 --> 41:10.634
Aunt Hilda, it's me.

41:10.718 --> 41:13.721
Oh! It's Sabrina. It's Sabrina!

41:14.305 --> 41:16.056
Come on!

41:16.432 --> 41:17.391
Oh!

41:17.725 --> 41:21.562
It's so nice to hear your voice.
How are you, my little possum?

41:21.645 --> 41:25.149
Uh, I'm okay,
but I need your and Aunt Zelda's help.

41:25.232 --> 41:28.652
Sabrina What have you done now?

41:30.237 --> 41:32.907
Children are dying at the academy,
Aunt Zee,

41:32.990 --> 41:35.576
and no one is doing anything to stop it.

41:35.659 --> 41:37.119
Dying

41:37.369 --> 41:40.664
Students have been harrowed to death
by other students.

41:41.415 --> 41:42.750
And the weird sisters...

41:44.084 --> 41:45.336
are harrowing me.

41:46.337 --> 41:48.797
-Are they now?
-We'll be right there, love.

41:48.881 --> 41:50.216
Okay. Please hurry.

41:51.675 --> 41:54.345
But Zelda, harrowings
have always been a part of the academy.

41:54.428 --> 41:55.262
They're tradition.

41:55.346 --> 41:57.389
You even participated in some yourself.

41:57.473 --> 42:00.935
Spirited child's play, Faustus.
I never killed a child!

42:01.018 --> 42:02.853
Other than your sister,
who is in violation

42:02.937 --> 42:05.189
of her excommunication by coming here.

42:05.272 --> 42:07.316
I would contend
that circumstances demanded it.

42:07.399 --> 42:09.902
And I would contend that
the Church of Night is only as strong

42:09.985 --> 42:13.572
as its weakest member,
and that a good harrowing forges the weak.

42:14.448 --> 42:16.367
My niece is not weak.

42:17.368 --> 42:19.870
Then really, sister,
what is there to worry about?

42:20.538 --> 42:22.665
What if it were your child being harrowed?

42:30.005 --> 42:32.800
-What did he say?
-He's going to look into it.

42:33.092 --> 42:34.093
And you believe him?

42:34.176 --> 42:36.387
Of course not. Take us to the children.

42:46.146 --> 42:47.106
Quentin?

42:47.648 --> 42:48.983
Would you please come out?

42:50.276 --> 42:52.361
We, uh... We want to help.

42:52.820 --> 42:54.530
And feel free to bring the others.

43:03.581 --> 43:07.793
Oh, the poor dears!
Your heart breaks for them.

43:08.252 --> 43:10.838
I think they're bound to the academy
because they died here.

43:10.921 --> 43:12.423
Witches hurting witches.

43:13.132 --> 43:14.216
It's unspeakable.

43:15.050 --> 43:16.427
How can we free them?

43:19.680 --> 43:21.307
Is that what you want, children?

43:21.890 --> 43:23.267
To be released from here?

43:24.518 --> 43:25.728
Where would we go?

43:26.395 --> 43:27.479
This is our home.

43:28.439 --> 43:29.440
Yes, it is.

43:31.150 --> 43:32.651
So what do you want, then?

43:36.697 --> 43:38.782
I-- I believe I know what they want.

43:41.952 --> 43:44.830
I was harrowed back in my day.

43:45.456 --> 43:47.333
By my own sister, no less.

43:48.500 --> 43:51.670
And the thing that I craved
more than anything in the world

43:51.920 --> 43:53.130
was revenge.

43:56.216 --> 43:58.510
They just need someone
to give them permission to do it.

43:59.470 --> 44:01.805
Isn't that what all
well-behaved children need?

44:01.889 --> 44:02.723
Permission?

44:04.266 --> 44:06.602
Okay. Come on.

44:06.685 --> 44:08.687
Gather around, my darlings.

44:09.897 --> 44:11.523
You listen to your Auntie Hilda.

44:13.192 --> 44:16.070
We're gonna play a game,
and you're gonna love it.

44:16.320 --> 44:17.696
We're gonna have fun.

44:18.155 --> 44:20.157
And you'll feel so much better.

44:22.785 --> 44:24.370
Why didn't you tell us about your uncle?

44:24.453 --> 44:26.372
Because my dad doesn't want us
talking about him.

44:26.455 --> 44:28.916
Also, your dad owns the mine
that made him sick.

44:28.999 --> 44:31.001
What did Jesse see down there

44:32.169 --> 44:34.213
Is that him -I dunno, Harvey.

44:34.296 --> 44:37.966
Susie, please.
I saw something in the mines, too.

45:14.920 --> 45:15.921
Uh...

45:16.797 --> 45:17.840
Mr. Putnam?

45:19.341 --> 45:20.968
I'm a friend of Susie's.

45:26.765 --> 45:27.599
Uh...

45:29.476 --> 45:30.686
Susie told me...

45:31.979 --> 45:34.231
you used to work in the mines, and...

45:37.234 --> 45:38.485
that's how you got sick.

45:44.283 --> 45:45.534
I've been down there...

45:46.535 --> 45:47.369
and...

45:48.620 --> 45:51.665
I'm wondering if maybe...
you saw what I saw.

45:53.709 --> 45:54.543
And...

45:55.961 --> 45:57.671
And if you'd be willing to talk to me.

46:01.967 --> 46:06.138
Or I could do the talking,
and you could just maybe ring yes or no?

46:07.556 --> 46:09.558
He's going to eat your souls!

46:38.545 --> 46:41.298
I don't think I'll be able to sleep a wink
until I know she's all right.

46:45.344 --> 46:47.095
Hilda

46:48.555 --> 46:52.726
When we were at the academy,
if I pushed your harrowing too far...

46:53.227 --> 46:54.102
"If"?

46:55.562 --> 46:56.772
You were ruthless.

47:03.237 --> 47:04.738
No, I know I was.

47:06.865 --> 47:08.325
And I'm sorry for that.

47:16.875 --> 47:19.127
Aren't you gonna go to bed?

47:26.343 --> 47:28.095
I thought I might stay up and read.

47:31.181 --> 47:32.975
Right.

47:34.393 --> 47:35.811
Should I put the kettle on?

47:54.204 --> 47:55.622
Are you ready to meet your fate?

47:56.039 --> 47:59.668
Prudence, please,
I'm begging you, leave me alone.

47:59.751 --> 48:02.129
There's not a hope in hell of that,
half-breed.

48:03.255 --> 48:04.506
Now get moving.

48:19.980 --> 48:23.108
Do you know what it's like
to die by hanging?

48:24.026 --> 48:26.528
Most people think it's fast, but it's not.

48:35.495 --> 48:36.872
Any last words?

48:39.249 --> 48:40.250
Yes.

48:41.668 --> 48:44.838
Thirteen witches were hanged here
by witch hunters.

48:45.088 --> 48:49.217
Those women couldn't possibly
have imagined a place like the academy.

48:49.676 --> 48:52.220
A school where witches would be safe.

48:52.304 --> 48:56.558
Even if they could, they'd never believe
that the women inside its walls

48:56.642 --> 48:58.644
would turn on one another like this.

48:59.728 --> 49:00.896
Which is why...

49:06.109 --> 49:11.949
the academy tradition of harrowing
ends tonight, Prudence.

49:13.784 --> 49:15.786
It's three against one.

49:16.828 --> 49:18.622
You're going to die, half-breed.

49:19.039 --> 49:21.333
So give the Dark Lord our best, won't you?

49:28.757 --> 49:31.218
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

49:31.301 --> 49:33.637
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

49:34.012 --> 49:36.264
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

49:36.348 --> 49:37.641
Light as a feather...

49:39.059 --> 49:41.311
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

49:47.693 --> 49:52.823
Like I said, harrowing of any kind
will no longer be tolerated.

49:53.532 --> 49:54.741
Understood?

49:56.660 --> 49:59.037
Light as a feather, stiff as a board.

50:02.916 --> 50:04.334
Understood?

50:45.500 --> 50:49.755
If you say another thing
about my mother or father to anyone

50:50.088 --> 50:51.965
ever again...

50:54.176 --> 50:56.720
I'll choke you to death on your own blood.

51:16.406 --> 51:18.867
He's been quiet for a while now.

51:24.122 --> 51:27.125
Think we should go check on him?

51:33.340 --> 51:34.382
Yeah, maybe.

51:46.603 --> 51:47.646
We probably should.

51:49.022 --> 51:50.524
Just to make sure he's okay.

52:43.201 --> 52:44.494
Quentin.

52:47.539 --> 52:49.541
What will you
and the other children do now?

52:49.624 --> 52:52.419
Watch over the school.
Make sure there are no more harrowings.

52:52.836 --> 52:54.045
Even after you're gone.

52:54.671 --> 52:56.506
Thank you, Miss, for everything.

52:57.257 --> 52:59.301
You're welcome. Glad we could help.

53:00.302 --> 53:01.261
Who are you talking to?

53:03.763 --> 53:04.639
Myself.

53:04.848 --> 53:06.558
-Hello, Nicholas.
-Hi.

53:06.641 --> 53:09.519
-You survived your immersion.
-I did. Barely.

53:09.728 --> 53:12.439
I haven't made it to conjuring class yet,
but I will.

53:12.814 --> 53:13.690
About that.

53:14.774 --> 53:17.652
Look, this has to be
our little secret, okay?

53:20.155 --> 53:23.200
-One of your dad's journals.
-But you said--

53:23.283 --> 53:25.535
I said I couldn't sneak you
into the library.

53:25.619 --> 53:27.204
I didn't say I couldn't sneak this out.

53:28.580 --> 53:30.415
Maybe it'll help
with the Acheron Configuration,

53:30.498 --> 53:33.335
but even if it doesn't,
you should get to know your father.

53:34.169 --> 53:36.213
Thank you, Nicholas.

53:37.130 --> 53:38.006
Really.

53:38.632 --> 53:39.674
Call me Nick.

53:46.765 --> 53:47.807
Bye.

54:03.698 --> 54:06.326
You asked to see me, Reverend Father.

54:06.409 --> 54:07.661
I did, Prudence.

54:10.664 --> 54:13.875
The three of you, senior students,
and one of her.

54:13.959 --> 54:17.462
A hedge witch without formal schooling,
a half-breed.

54:17.545 --> 54:18.755
Yet she bested you.

54:20.507 --> 54:22.092
She humiliated you!

54:25.095 --> 54:26.471
There's no excuse, Father.

54:27.764 --> 54:29.182
It will not happen again.

54:30.600 --> 54:31.518
I hope not.

54:33.395 --> 54:37.107
The Dark Lord wants Sabrina educated
at the academy.

54:38.275 --> 54:39.276
So be it.

54:40.568 --> 54:43.989
But he gave no indication that
she shouldn't suffer while she's here.

55:36.458 --> 55:39.669
You should've let me drive
up there. For both our sakes.

55:39.753 --> 55:40.962
Next time for sure.

55:41.171 --> 55:43.548
The stuff we do for family, huh?

55:44.549 --> 55:45.383
Yeah.

55:45.717 --> 55:46.634
Ugh.

55:48.386 --> 55:51.139
That's about all I care to see
of that business.

55:52.515 --> 55:55.685
So how was the rest of the expo

55:55.977 --> 55:56.811
What?

55:57.562 --> 56:00.023
Oh, yeah. Uh, yeah, she did, yeah.

56:00.357 --> 56:01.858
How was your weekend?

56:01.941 --> 56:05.153
Insane. I wanna tell you about this thing
that happened with Susie's uncle,

56:05.236 --> 56:07.197
but it might be better to do in person.

56:07.530 --> 56:08.365
Can I come over?

56:09.783 --> 56:10.784
Right now?

56:10.867 --> 56:14.287
I have a lot of homework
to catch up on tonight,
