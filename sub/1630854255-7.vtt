WEBVTT

04:56.421 --> 04:58.089
Have you seen your father?

05:00.341 --> 05:03.261
Your little cousins
have lost their mother.

05:03.344 --> 05:05.013
They could use a kind word.

05:05.096 --> 05:06.931
I have an equal claim to sympathy.

05:07.015 --> 05:08.725
-Jace.
-We should be at Harrenhal,

05:08.808 --> 05:10.727
mourning Lord Lyonel and Ser Harwin.

05:12.103 --> 05:14.439
It would not be appropriate.

05:15.398 --> 05:19.068
The Velaryons are our kin
and the Strongs are not.

05:19.777 --> 05:20.903
Look at me.

05:21.696 --> 05:23.239
Do you understand?

05:51.851 --> 05:53.436
Hand turns loom;

05:53.519 --> 05:55.438
spool of green, spool of black;

05:55.521 --> 05:57.857
dragons of flesh

05:57.940 --> 06:00.485
weaving dragons of thread.

06:00.568 --> 06:03.863
Hand turns loom; spool of green...

06:03.946 --> 06:07.200
-We have nothing in common.
-She's our sister.

06:07.283 --> 06:09.911
-You marry her, then.
-I would perform my duty,

06:09.994 --> 06:12.622
-if mother had only betrothed us.
- If only.

06:12.705 --> 06:14.373
It would strengthen the family.

06:14.457 --> 06:16.125
Keep our Valyrian blood pure.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.795
-She's an idiot.
-She's your future queen.

06:21.214 --> 06:23.299
We actually do have

06:24.300 --> 06:25.885
one thing in common.

06:25.968 --> 06:29.514
We both fancy creatures
with very long legs.

06:31.599 --> 06:33.059
Wench!

06:33.851 --> 06:36.187
-Another!
-Aegon.

06:36.854 --> 06:39.690
...dragon's flesh,
weaving dragons of thread.

06:48.741 --> 06:52.078
Lyonel Strong's son's been staring at you
since the moment we arrived, Your Grace.

06:56.457 --> 06:58.000
Unabashedly.

06:59.502 --> 07:02.046
It is only a look of pride, Ser Criston.

07:02.964 --> 07:05.299
Larys is the new Lord of Harrenhal.

07:40.376 --> 07:42.170
Both my seat and High Tide

07:42.253 --> 07:44.547
will be yours one day, Lucerys.

07:45.673 --> 07:47.758
Your brother will be king, of course.

07:48.759 --> 07:51.679
He'll sit on endless
councils and ceremonies,

07:51.762 --> 07:53.973
but Lord of the Tides rules the sea.

07:55.016 --> 07:56.142
Sorry.

07:56.225 --> 07:57.810
I don't want it.

08:01.230 --> 08:03.149
It's your birthright, lad.

08:06.986 --> 08:11.199
If I'm the Lord of Driftmark,
it means everyone's dead.

08:18.039 --> 08:20.958
-I'm very sorry.
-Thank you. Thank you.

08:44.607 --> 08:45.942
Grandma...

08:50.404 --> 08:52.240
I don't want Mother to be gone.

10:06.605 --> 10:08.149
Retrieve your patron.

10:11.652 --> 10:12.778
Brother.

10:54.153 --> 10:56.697
Your girls are the very
image of their mother.

10:57.948 --> 11:00.117
A comfort and an anguish,

11:00.201 --> 11:02.119
as I well remember.

11:02.995 --> 11:04.872
The gods can be cruel.

11:07.208 --> 11:09.251
It seems they've been
especially cruel to you.

11:11.420 --> 11:12.380
Yes.

11:27.103 --> 11:29.814
You should return with us
to King's Landing.

11:29.897 --> 11:31.524
It's time that you came home.

11:31.607 --> 11:33.275
Pentos is my home...

11:34.485 --> 11:37.029
-and that of my children.
-Daemon...

11:37.988 --> 11:40.574
I know we've had our differences,

11:40.658 --> 11:42.576
but let them pass with the years.

11:44.203 --> 11:46.247
There's a place for you in my court

11:46.330 --> 11:47.665
if that's something you should need.

11:47.748 --> 11:50.292
I need... nothing.

12:00.052 --> 12:01.512
Brother.

12:06.142 --> 12:08.519
I'm sorry for your loss, my Prince.

12:09.228 --> 12:12.898
No matter how fat the leech grows,
it always wants for another meal.

12:24.160 --> 12:25.327
Go to bed.

12:25.411 --> 12:27.329
-But, Mother--
-Go to bed.

12:38.382 --> 12:39.925
I'm going to bed, Aemma.

12:41.760 --> 12:44.680
Shall I see after Queen Alicent,
Your Grace?

12:48.142 --> 12:49.727
No, Ser Harrold.

12:49.810 --> 12:51.729
You have the night's watch, Ser Criston.

12:53.981 --> 12:55.941
Lord Commander.

13:28.933 --> 13:30.059
Brother?

13:36.023 --> 13:37.525
Get to bed.

14:38.961 --> 14:41.547
She wanted to come home

14:41.630 --> 14:43.382
and he denied her.

14:44.466 --> 14:47.011
Daemon did what he thought best.

14:48.679 --> 14:51.348
Daemon only ever does
what is best for Daemon.

14:52.933 --> 14:55.060
Laena needed our maesters.

15:00.399 --> 15:02.985
The surgeons in Pentos are as well-trained

15:03.068 --> 15:04.612
as our maesters.

15:08.574 --> 15:13.579
You are looking to place blame
for an act of the gods.

15:15.164 --> 15:17.166
Mayhaps the gods have scorned us...

15:18.834 --> 15:21.962
for our insatiable pride.

15:27.801 --> 15:29.762
The crown was yours

15:29.845 --> 15:34.099
until those fools at the Great Council
plucked it from your head.

15:36.810 --> 15:40.439
Is it such a terrible thing
for your husband to wish to win it back?

15:40.522 --> 15:43.651
Tonight of all nights,
let us lay aside this falsehood.

15:47.196 --> 15:49.239
It is not justice for
your wife that drives you.

15:49.323 --> 15:50.991
It is your own ambition.

15:51.867 --> 15:53.661
'Tis desire for the throne,

15:53.744 --> 15:57.081
if not for yourself, then for the scions
of your house.

15:57.164 --> 15:59.708
I gave up the idea of wearing a crown
a generation ago.

15:59.792 --> 16:02.920
It is you, lord husband,
who refuses to abandon this pursuit,

16:03.003 --> 16:05.547
even now, at the cost of our children.

16:21.021 --> 16:23.357
What is this brief mortal life...

16:24.608 --> 16:26.402
if not the pursuit of legacy?

16:26.485 --> 16:29.321
Legacy may be why you
live your life, Corlys.

16:40.791 --> 16:44.336
I want Driftmark to pass through
Laena's line to Baela.

16:46.380 --> 16:48.298
To true Velaryon blood.

16:49.967 --> 16:51.552
Declare it now,
while all are gathered here,

16:51.635 --> 16:54.012
and we will say that is how we will honor
Laena's memory.

16:54.096 --> 16:56.306
And disinherit our son?

16:56.390 --> 16:58.600
He will be the King Consort.

16:58.684 --> 17:00.686
His son will one day sit the Iron Throne.

17:00.769 --> 17:03.439
You would have me cast
an even darker shadow

17:03.522 --> 17:05.399
over those little boys
than already exists.

17:05.482 --> 17:06.734
We are alone here, husband.

17:06.817 --> 17:09.820
You can speak the plain truth
as we both know it:

17:17.119 --> 17:19.288
Rhaenyra's children are not of your blood.

17:27.171 --> 17:29.089
But Laena's are.

17:32.593 --> 17:34.511
They are her legacy.

17:35.804 --> 17:39.349
History does not remember blood.

17:44.062 --> 17:45.981
It remembers names.

18:07.169 --> 18:09.755
Laenor has been restless for years,

18:09.838 --> 18:14.301
but now, he will be useless.

18:14.384 --> 18:15.511
Or worse.

18:18.263 --> 18:21.016
I know better than anyone
that our marriage is a farce.

18:22.351 --> 18:26.063
But I at least make the effort
to maintain appearances.

18:27.397 --> 18:28.941
You have more to lose.

18:30.234 --> 18:33.779
Yes, well, that has been
my lot since my father named me heir.

18:36.490 --> 18:38.033
We did try...

18:39.743 --> 18:41.119
to conceive a child.

18:41.203 --> 18:45.332
We performed our duty as best we could.

18:48.043 --> 18:49.586
But to no avail.

18:56.802 --> 18:58.679
There was no joy in it.

19:02.766 --> 19:04.685
I found that elsewhere.

19:07.771 --> 19:09.439
It felt good to be desired.

19:12.860 --> 19:15.404
I understand Ser Harwin was quite...

19:17.656 --> 19:19.408
devoted to you.

19:21.618 --> 19:23.120
Yes, he was.

19:24.955 --> 19:26.498
And I trusted him.

19:31.712 --> 19:34.882
Should've forbidden Ser Harwin
from returning to the Riverlands.

19:36.633 --> 19:39.928
Harren's curse is said to be as strong now
as it was after the Conquest.

19:40.012 --> 19:41.430
That's a ghost story,

19:41.513 --> 19:44.892
one Ser Otto and the Queen
would gladly exploit.

19:44.975 --> 19:48.520
I do not believe Alicent
capable of cold murder.

19:52.733 --> 19:55.277
Each of us is capable of depravity.

19:56.904 --> 19:58.822
And more than you would believe.

20:02.326 --> 20:04.244
I believe it of you.

20:06.580 --> 20:08.165
If you're accusing me of some depravity,

20:08.248 --> 20:10.375
you'll need to be more specific.

20:12.461 --> 20:14.296
I've been alone.

20:15.547 --> 20:17.716
-You abandoned me.
-I spared you.

20:17.799 --> 20:20.385
-You were a child.
-Yes.

20:20.469 --> 20:22.221
Yes, I was a child.

20:22.304 --> 20:24.848
And look at what my life
became without you.

20:26.725 --> 20:28.602
Droll tragedy.

20:28.685 --> 20:31.313
And I wonder what you
think of mine by comparison?

20:31.396 --> 20:32.940
I know little of it.

20:38.820 --> 20:40.364
Did you love her?

20:43.033 --> 20:44.785
We were happy enough.

20:46.328 --> 20:48.872
Well, that in itself
is a great achievement.

20:54.753 --> 20:56.672
-I am sorry.
-Don't be.

20:58.799 --> 21:01.343
I am at least allowed to mourn my losses.

21:31.832 --> 21:33.291
Rhaenyra.

21:38.463 --> 21:40.382
I'm no longer a child.

22:00.527 --> 22:02.070
I want you.

25:03.835 --> 25:05.170
Fuck.

26:34.301 --> 26:36.219
Dohaeras!

26:36.928 --> 26:40.181
Dohaeras, Vhagar! Lykiri!

26:41.474 --> 26:42.809
Lykiri!

26:47.814 --> 26:48.940
Lykiri.

27:37.739 --> 27:38.865
Soves!

27:42.118 --> 27:45.663
Dohaeras, Vhagar! Soves!

29:35.273 --> 29:36.941
Yeah!

30:00.507 --> 30:02.383
Jace, Jace.

30:02.467 --> 30:05.011
Jace, wake up. Wake up.

30:06.846 --> 30:09.849
-Someone stole Vhagar.
- What?

30:29.786 --> 30:30.954
Who is it?

30:55.395 --> 30:57.564
Jace, what are we doing?

30:57.647 --> 30:59.732
-It's him.
-It's me.

30:59.816 --> 31:02.986
-Vhagar is my mother's dragon.
-Your mother's dead.

31:03.069 --> 31:05.446
-And Vhagar has a new rider now.
-She was mine to claim.

31:05.530 --> 31:07.240
Then you should've claimed her!

31:07.323 --> 31:09.534
Maybe your cousins
can find you a pig to ride.

31:09.617 --> 31:10.702
It would suit you.

31:16.833 --> 31:18.835
Come at me again
and I'll feed you to my dragon!

31:50.825 --> 31:54.203
You will die screaming in flames
just as your father did!

31:54.287 --> 31:55.288
Bastards.

31:55.371 --> 31:57.206
My father's still alive.

31:58.124 --> 32:00.668
He doesn't know, does he, Lord Strong?

32:03.296 --> 32:04.213
Jace!

32:24.442 --> 32:25.693
Cease this at once!

32:27.278 --> 32:28.404
Get away!

32:31.074 --> 32:33.993
My Prince, my Prince. Let me see.

32:37.705 --> 32:39.624
Gods be good.

32:40.958 --> 32:43.503
How could you allow
such a thing to happen?

32:45.797 --> 32:47.382
I will have answers.

32:47.465 --> 32:50.009
The princes were supposed
to be abed, My King.

32:50.718 --> 32:52.261
Who had the watch?

32:52.887 --> 32:55.515
Young prince was attacked by
his own cousins, Your Grace.

32:55.598 --> 32:59.727
You swore oaths to protect
and defend my blood!

32:59.811 --> 33:01.396
I'm very sorry, Your Grace.

33:01.479 --> 33:03.690
The Kingsguard has never had to defend
princes from princes,

33:03.773 --> 33:05.733
-Your Grace.
-That is no answer!

33:05.817 --> 33:08.027
It will heal, will it not, maester?

33:10.196 --> 33:11.531
The flesh will heal.

33:14.659 --> 33:16.828
But the eye is lost, Your Grace.

33:19.247 --> 33:21.416
-Where were you?
-Me?

33:21.499 --> 33:23.334
-What was that for?
-That was nothing

33:23.418 --> 33:25.128
compared to the abuse
your brother suffered

33:25.211 --> 33:27.171
while you were drowning
in your cups, you fool.

33:27.255 --> 33:29.632
What is the meaning of this?

33:29.716 --> 33:32.093
Baela, Rhaena!
What happened?

33:32.176 --> 33:33.302
What happened?

33:38.266 --> 33:39.434
Jace?

33:40.143 --> 33:41.352
Luke!

33:43.146 --> 33:45.398
Show me. Show me.

33:45.481 --> 33:47.108
-Who did this?
-They attacked me!

33:47.191 --> 33:49.277
-He attacked Baela!
-He broke Luke's nose!

33:54.699 --> 33:56.868
He stole my mother's dragon!

33:56.951 --> 33:58.995
-Enough.
-He was gonna kill Jace!

33:59.078 --> 34:00.121
-I didn't do anything!
-Enough--

34:00.204 --> 34:01.539
It should be my son telling the tale!

34:01.622 --> 34:03.541
-He called us--
- Silence!

34:07.295 --> 34:09.422
He called us bastards.

34:15.762 --> 34:17.638
Aemond...

34:17.722 --> 34:19.557
I will have the truth of what happened.

34:21.684 --> 34:23.686
-Now.
-What else is there to hear?

34:23.770 --> 34:25.855
Your son has been maimed.
Her son is responsible.

34:25.938 --> 34:28.107
-It was a regrettable accident.
-Accident?

34:28.191 --> 34:30.401
The Prince Lucerys brought
a blade to the ambush.

34:30.485 --> 34:32.069
He meant to kill my son.

34:32.153 --> 34:34.655
It was my sons who were attacked

34:34.739 --> 34:37.366
and forced to defend themselves.

34:37.450 --> 34:40.286
Vile insults were levied against them.

34:40.369 --> 34:41.913
What insults?

34:45.625 --> 34:49.045
The legitimacy of my sons' birth was
put loudly to question.

34:49.128 --> 34:51.672
-What?
-He called us bastards.

34:56.719 --> 35:00.973
My sons are in line to inherit
the Iron Throne, Your Grace.

35:01.057 --> 35:03.351
This is the highest of treasons.

35:04.769 --> 35:06.729
Prince Aemond must be sharply questioned

35:06.813 --> 35:09.732
so we might learn where
he heard such slanders.

35:11.234 --> 35:12.777
Over an insult?

35:13.778 --> 35:16.072
My son has lost an eye.

35:18.658 --> 35:21.619
You tell me, boy.
Where did you hear this lie?

35:21.702 --> 35:23.287
The insult was training yard bluster.

35:23.371 --> 35:25.748
-The lot of boys. It was nothing.
-Aemond...

35:25.832 --> 35:27.375
I asked you a question.

35:30.545 --> 35:33.548
Where is Ser Laenor, I wonder?
The boys' father?

35:33.631 --> 35:35.675
Perhaps he might have
something to say in the matter.

35:35.758 --> 35:37.134
Yes. Where is Ser Laenor?

35:38.177 --> 35:41.806
I do not know, Your Grace.
I... could not find sleep.

35:41.889 --> 35:43.766
I had gone out to walk.

35:43.850 --> 35:46.143
Entertaining his young squires,
I would venture.

35:50.189 --> 35:51.315
Aemond...

35:52.859 --> 35:53.985
look at me.

35:56.404 --> 35:58.447
Your king demands an answer.

35:58.531 --> 36:00.658
Who spoke these lies to you?

36:18.134 --> 36:19.468
It was Aegon.

36:22.221 --> 36:23.222
Me?

36:25.892 --> 36:28.019
And you, boy?

36:31.063 --> 36:33.608
Where did you hear such calumnies?

36:34.442 --> 36:37.987
Aegon! Tell me the truth of it!

36:39.780 --> 36:42.325
We know, Father.

36:44.076 --> 36:46.203
Everyone knows.

36:47.747 --> 36:49.290
Just look at them.

37:06.223 --> 37:09.393
This interminable infighting must cease!

37:09.477 --> 37:10.811
All of you!

37:13.481 --> 37:15.399
We are family!

37:20.029 --> 37:23.199
Now make your apologies and show good will
to one another.

37:24.116 --> 37:28.037
Your father, your grandsire,
your king demands it!

37:43.302 --> 37:44.845
That is insufficient.

37:47.848 --> 37:50.017
Aemond has been damaged,
permanently, My King.

37:50.101 --> 37:51.644
"Good will" cannot make him whole.

37:51.727 --> 37:55.398
I know, Alicent,
but I cannot restore his eye.

37:55.481 --> 37:57.149
No, because it's been taken.

37:57.233 --> 38:00.778
-What would you have me do?
-There is a debt to be paid.

38:04.198 --> 38:08.119
I shall have one of her
son's eyes in return.

38:09.704 --> 38:13.082
-My dear wife.
-He is your son, Viserys.

38:13.165 --> 38:14.583
Your blood.

38:14.667 --> 38:16.043
Do not...

38:16.127 --> 38:19.463
allow your temper to guide your judgment.

38:25.219 --> 38:28.055
If the King will not seek justice,
the Queen will.

38:28.139 --> 38:29.265
Ser Criston...

38:30.683 --> 38:32.601
bring me the eye of Lucerys Velaryon.

38:33.811 --> 38:34.979
-Mother!
-Alicent.

38:35.062 --> 38:37.732
He can choose which eye to keep,
a privilege he did not grant my son.

38:37.815 --> 38:39.233
You will do no such thing.

38:39.317 --> 38:41.861
-Stay your hand.
-No, you are sworn to me!

38:46.365 --> 38:48.492
As your protector, my Queen.

38:51.537 --> 38:56.542
Alicent, this matter... is finished.

38:56.625 --> 38:58.169
Do you understand?

39:09.513 --> 39:11.140
And let it be known:

39:11.223 --> 39:13.225
anyone whose tongue dares
to question the birth

39:13.309 --> 39:15.478
of Princess Rhaenyra's sons

39:15.561 --> 39:17.688
should have it removed.

39:20.524 --> 39:22.068
Thank you, Father.

39:32.953 --> 39:34.872
-Your Grace. Stay with the King!
-Alicent!

39:34.955 --> 39:36.624
Hold your approach!

39:36.707 --> 39:38.417
-Do not, Ser Criston!
-Alicent!

39:38.501 --> 39:40.169
Do not, Ser Criston!

39:40.252 --> 39:41.378
Alicent!

39:42.254 --> 39:43.798
No!

39:44.381 --> 39:46.300
Stay your hand, Cole!

39:47.676 --> 39:49.178
You've gone too far.

39:49.261 --> 39:50.596
I?

39:50.679 --> 39:52.890
What have I done but
what was expected of me?

39:54.100 --> 39:57.520
Forever upholding the kingdom,
the family, the law.

39:59.271 --> 40:02.316
-While you flout all to do as you please.
-Alicent, let her go!

40:02.399 --> 40:04.902
Where is duty? Where is sacrifice?

40:04.985 --> 40:06.737
It's trampled under
your pretty foot again.

40:06.821 --> 40:08.656
Release the blade, Alicent.

40:09.156 --> 40:11.325
And now you take my son's eye,

40:11.408 --> 40:12.993
and to even that, you feel entitled.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.121
Exhausting, wasn't it?

40:15.204 --> 40:18.124
Hiding beneath the cloak
of your own righteousness.

40:19.208 --> 40:22.002
But now they see you as you are.

40:59.957 --> 41:01.625
Do not mourn me, Mother.

41:02.084 --> 41:03.836
It was a fair exchange.

41:05.004 --> 41:06.922
I may have lost an eye...

41:08.465 --> 41:10.384
but I gained a dragon.

41:18.767 --> 41:20.895
This proceeding is at an end.

41:58.974 --> 42:00.518
The Hand, Your Grace.

42:17.743 --> 42:19.620
Say your piece.

42:19.703 --> 42:21.830
Now, what piece is that?

42:24.833 --> 42:27.628
I've conducted myself in a manner...

42:27.711 --> 42:29.838
unbefitting my station.

42:31.382 --> 42:32.716
Or any other.

42:36.178 --> 42:37.721
I lost composure...

42:39.765 --> 42:41.308
assaulted the Princess.

42:43.644 --> 42:47.106
Already the word is spreading,
the gossip speculating that I've gone mad.

42:48.899 --> 42:50.484
All true.

42:50.567 --> 42:52.111
I disgraced myself.

42:54.321 --> 42:57.866
And ensured my husband's favor
will forever rest on her.

42:59.451 --> 43:00.828
And yet...

43:02.538 --> 43:05.291
I've never seen that side of you,
my daughter.

43:08.252 --> 43:09.962
I even doubted its existence.

43:10.045 --> 43:13.590
-It was an ugly thing. I regret it.
-We play an ugly game.

43:15.467 --> 43:16.844
And now, for the first time,

43:16.927 --> 43:20.222
I see that you have
the determination to win it.

43:24.101 --> 43:27.229
-Rhaenyra--
-You see her for what she is.

43:27.313 --> 43:30.232
What the King's stubbornness has wrought.

43:34.403 --> 43:36.947
-What will he say to me?
-He'll forgive you.

43:38.991 --> 43:40.534
What else can he do?

43:41.827 --> 43:44.496
Now go to him, be penitent,

43:44.580 --> 43:47.249
plead the injury to your son.

43:47.333 --> 43:49.251
Keep a grip on your passions.

43:50.252 --> 43:54.298
And I promise you, in time,
you and I together will prevail.

43:57.593 --> 43:59.636
What that rogue Aemond has done

43:59.720 --> 44:02.264
in winning Vhagar to our side.

44:04.224 --> 44:05.809
The boy was right.

44:05.893 --> 44:09.021
It's worth a thousand times
the price he paid.

44:36.340 --> 44:39.676
You will scar, but the wound will heal.

44:40.844 --> 44:43.347
Valyrian steel cuts clean.

44:50.896 --> 44:51.814
Gods.

44:53.982 --> 44:55.776
Is everyone all right?

44:55.859 --> 44:57.528
A broken nose is the worst.

44:57.611 --> 44:58.946
Thank you, maester.

44:59.613 --> 45:00.739
Leave us.

45:04.952 --> 45:06.537
You as well.

45:06.620 --> 45:09.456
You've already found enough trouble today.

45:09.540 --> 45:10.666
Yes, Mother.

45:18.674 --> 45:20.300
I should've been there.

45:20.384 --> 45:22.302
Those should be our house words.

45:25.389 --> 45:28.100
I have fought dreadful enemies,

45:28.183 --> 45:30.811
but I could not defend my dear sister

45:30.894 --> 45:33.021
far from home and in agony.

45:34.523 --> 45:37.443
-I could not defend you.
-Sit down.

45:48.203 --> 45:50.747
Aemond called our sons bastards.

45:57.379 --> 45:59.047
I have failed you, Rhaenyra.

46:00.048 --> 46:01.383
Our marriage...

46:02.885 --> 46:04.052
I tried.

46:06.388 --> 46:07.723
Our boys...

46:09.433 --> 46:10.976
-I do love them.
-I know.

46:11.059 --> 46:12.352
Deeply.

46:16.356 --> 46:18.275
But I have not, mayhaps...

46:19.902 --> 46:21.236
loved them enough.

46:27.201 --> 46:29.745
I had hoped to bear your children.

46:31.497 --> 46:33.415
The few times we lay together.

46:37.211 --> 46:39.129
Things might've been different.

46:42.716 --> 46:45.844
I hate the gods for making me as they did.

46:47.012 --> 46:48.555
I do not.

46:49.348 --> 46:50.807
You are an honorable man

46:52.017 --> 46:53.560
with a good heart.

46:55.145 --> 46:57.272
It's a rare thing.

47:02.819 --> 47:05.197
We made an arrangement all those years ago

47:05.280 --> 47:07.616
to do our duty and...

47:08.909 --> 47:10.827
yet explore happiness.

47:18.752 --> 47:20.170
But there are times

47:20.254 --> 47:23.382
I think when these things
cannot mutually exist.

47:26.468 --> 47:30.389
Ser Qarl will return soon
to the fighting in the Stepstones.

47:32.182 --> 47:34.309
But I recommit myself to you.

47:36.144 --> 47:40.440
And to strengthening our house
as we prepare you for your ascension.

47:40.524 --> 47:43.694
I will raise our sons
to be princes of the realm.

47:43.777 --> 47:46.321
-Laenor--
-You deserve better than what I have been.

47:49.074 --> 47:50.993
You deserve a husband.

48:11.305 --> 48:14.141
I've asked them to have wine ready
for you on the ship.

48:14.224 --> 48:15.350
To help you sleep.

48:23.942 --> 48:25.485
I'm so sorry.

48:28.488 --> 48:29.656
Viserys...

48:29.740 --> 48:31.658
We will speak no more of it.

49:47.776 --> 49:49.903
Fire is such strange power.

49:54.324 --> 49:57.703
Everything that House Targaryen
possesses is owed to it.

49:59.871 --> 50:02.124
Yet it has cost us both what we loved.

50:04.084 --> 50:05.794
Perhaps the Velaryons
knew the truth of it.

50:05.877 --> 50:07.796
The sea is the better ally.

50:09.172 --> 50:11.299
Fire is a prison.

50:11.383 --> 50:13.927
The sea offers an escape.

50:23.145 --> 50:25.397
A perversion of justice.

50:25.480 --> 50:27.357
The young prince...

50:27.441 --> 50:28.567
defiled.

50:30.110 --> 50:31.278
An outrage.

50:33.405 --> 50:34.614
Indeed.

50:38.285 --> 50:42.664
If it's an eye you want to balance
the scales, I am your servant.

50:47.794 --> 50:49.629
That will not be necessary.

50:52.549 --> 50:54.843
But your devotion has not gone unnoticed.

50:56.511 --> 50:58.555
These are dangerous times.

51:03.185 --> 51:06.313
The day will doubtless come
when I require such a friend.

51:07.731 --> 51:11.276
With not only skill
but discretion as well.

51:14.154 --> 51:17.282
I shall await your call, my Queen.

51:33.381 --> 51:35.300
I need you, Uncle.

52:37.737 --> 52:40.657
We could not marry
unless Laenor were dead.

52:46.079 --> 52:47.372
I know.

53:01.219 --> 53:04.764
I've heard about your exploits
in the Stepstones,

53:04.848 --> 53:06.182
Ser Qarl.

53:06.808 --> 53:09.644
Said to be a knight of remarkable skill.

53:09.728 --> 53:11.438
You flatter me, m'lord.

53:11.521 --> 53:13.607
But alas, common-born.

53:14.316 --> 53:17.903
You're a landless knight
with a lord's taste.

53:17.986 --> 53:19.696
Ser Laenor's been kind to me.

53:21.406 --> 53:22.741
Do you know...

53:25.327 --> 53:28.079
there are places across the Narrow Sea...

53:29.122 --> 53:32.042
where it doesn't matter
what a man's name is?

53:33.001 --> 53:35.545
Only how much gold he possesses.

53:39.090 --> 53:41.009
What are you asking of me, m'lord?

53:42.552 --> 53:44.095
A quick death.

53:44.971 --> 53:46.514
One with witnesses.

53:55.440 --> 53:56.983
I will not be a tyrant.

53:58.401 --> 53:59.986
And rule through terror.

54:00.946 --> 54:02.864
A tyrant rules only through terror.

54:09.621 --> 54:12.165
If the King isn't feared, he is powerless.

54:13.249 --> 54:16.294
If you are to be a strong queen,
you must cultivate love and respect, yes,

54:16.378 --> 54:19.089
but your subjects must fear you.

54:19.172 --> 54:20.715
Who let you in here?

54:24.386 --> 54:26.596
Why are you in my father's hall?

54:31.685 --> 54:33.603
You have always looked down on me.

54:34.771 --> 54:37.065
I do love Laenor.

54:37.148 --> 54:39.234
Then grant him this kindness.

54:40.235 --> 54:41.403
Set him free.

54:41.486 --> 54:43.029
You forget yourself.

54:45.281 --> 54:47.200
My lord. Please!

54:53.456 --> 54:54.541
I'll alert the guards!

55:04.592 --> 55:07.053
This will cost Lord Corlys
and Princess Rhaenys

55:07.137 --> 55:09.055
their only remaining child.

55:12.225 --> 55:15.353
And the realm will whisper
that I was somehow responsible.

55:19.190 --> 55:20.942
No!

55:21.026 --> 55:22.402
Let them whisper.

55:22.485 --> 55:24.029
No!

55:26.531 --> 55:27.866
How did you let this happen?

55:27.949 --> 55:29.909
In my fucking hall?

55:29.993 --> 55:31.202
Tell me!

55:31.286 --> 55:34.664
We will know the truth of it
and our enemies won't.

55:35.457 --> 55:38.376
They will fear what else
we might be capable of.
