01:05.433 --> 01:08.333
saved the sport of football.

01:08.335 --> 01:10.169
I put the word "sport" in

01:16.177 --> 01:20.646
<i>Our story begins late 1890s</i>
<i>when football was just</i>

01:20.648 --> 01:24.249
<i>a college game, and there was</i>
<i>no forward passing,</i>

01:24.251 --> 01:27.086
just dudes who would
smash their bodies

01:27.088 --> 01:30.255
into each other's bodies,
and then so in 19--

01:30.257 --> 01:34.927
<i>nope, 1894, there was this</i>
<i>annual game between Harvard</i>

01:34.929 --> 01:39.498
<i>and Yale that was so violent</i>
<i>it was called:</i>

01:41.835 --> 01:45.404
Because it was just massacre.

01:45.406 --> 01:48.941
<i>Seven people</i>
<i>were carted off the field</i>

01:48.943 --> 01:51.376
with dying injuries.

01:51.378 --> 01:56.181
<i>Yale won the game, and so they</i>
<i>were so excited in their win,</i>

01:56.183 --> 01:59.017
<i>they just started</i>
<i>punching people.</i>

01:59.019 --> 02:01.019
<i>They were like, oh, my God.</i>

02:01.021 --> 02:01.954
<i>We won that game.</i>

02:01.956 --> 02:06.492
<i>Like, it was really hard</i>
<i>to watch, but we crushed them,</i>

02:06.494 --> 02:10.362
literally and also
subject--object--what?

02:10.364 --> 02:12.431
<i>What's the opposite</i>
<i>of literally?</i>

02:12.433 --> 02:13.899
<i>- Figuratively.</i>
<i>- Thank you.</i>

02:13.901 --> 02:17.503
<i>Literally and figuratively</i>
<i>we crushed those guys.</i>

02:17.505 --> 02:20.873
The Harvard fans were like,
I want to go home and cry

02:20.875 --> 02:23.575
<i>and also invent Facebook.</i>

02:23.577 --> 02:26.979
[both chuckling]

02:28.348 --> 02:32.818
<i>And that game was sort of the</i>
<i>catalyst for people realizing</i>

02:32.820 --> 02:34.686
<i>hey, maybe, um...</i>

02:34.688 --> 02:38.524
<i>football is, like,</i>
<i>not good</i>

02:38.526 --> 02:43.795
<i>because people are dying</i>
<i>in a large sum</i>

02:43.797 --> 02:44.496
<i>every year.</i>

02:44.498 --> 02:50.769
<i>So enter Teddy Roosevelt,</i>
<i>who was a huge football fan.</i>

02:50.771 --> 02:54.039
<i>Like, he loved anything</i>
<i>brutally manly.</i>

02:54.041 --> 02:58.243
<i>So football to Teddy was, like,</i>
<i>what America was about.</i>

02:58.245 --> 03:01.847
<i>And so when they banned that</i>
<i>game between Harvard and Yale,</i>

03:01.849 --> 03:02.681
<i>he was like, excuse me.</i>

03:02.683 --> 03:03.949
<i>No.</i>
<i>Bring that game back.</i>

03:03.951 --> 03:06.618
<i>We love that game.</i>
<i>It means a lot to us as people.</i>

03:06.620 --> 03:07.553
<i>It's been two years.</i>

03:07.555 --> 03:08.987
<i>I can't live without it</i>
<i>anymore.</i>

03:08.989 --> 03:12.191
Which is how I felt about sex
in college.

03:12.825 --> 03:13.559
- [laughs]

03:13.561 --> 03:19.665
<i>- So, like, Teddy Roosevelt's</i>
<i>son, Theodore Roosevelt Jr.</i>

03:19.667 --> 03:22.334
joins the Harvard freshman
football team.

03:22.336 --> 03:26.738
<i>So his first game,</i>
<i>the other team targeted him</i>

03:26.740 --> 03:29.341
<i>because he's</i>
<i>the president's son, and--</i>

03:29.343 --> 03:31.677
<i>[mimics bone breaking]</i>
<i>Nose broken.</i>

03:31.679 --> 03:32.477
<i>Like, right away.</i>

03:32.479 --> 03:34.947
<i>And then they put a huge gash</i>
<i>on his face.</i>

03:34.949 --> 03:38.283
<i>So Teddy Roosevelt decided</i>
<i>that football's fantastic,</i>

03:38.285 --> 03:41.320
<i>but it's maybe a little bit</i>
<i>too violent.</i>

03:41.322 --> 03:43.889
<i>Like, maybe we could</i>
<i>calm it down.</i>

03:43.891 --> 03:46.725
And, you know, in his
spare time he was president,

03:46.727 --> 03:49.728
<i>so he ended</i>
<i>the Russo-Japanese War</i>

03:49.730 --> 03:52.331
<i>and then was like,</i>
<i>I'm also gonna fix--</i>

03:52.333 --> 03:54.032
<i>I'm gonna save football.</i>

03:54.034 --> 03:56.235
So anyway...

03:56.237 --> 03:58.103
what was I talking about?

03:58.105 --> 03:58.971
- Teddy Roosevelt.

03:58.973 --> 04:00.872
- So Teddy Roosevelt
called this meeting

04:00.874 --> 04:04.209
<i>with the heads of the</i>
<i>college football powerhouses,</i>

04:04.211 --> 04:07.879
<i>and he was like,</i>
<i>look, guys, football.</i>

04:07.881 --> 04:09.848
<i>Pretty violent, right?</i>

04:09.850 --> 04:11.116
<i>Like, love the sport.</i>

04:11.118 --> 04:12.184
<i>Doing a great job.</i>

04:12.186 --> 04:13.819
<i>Let's not kill so many people.</i>

04:13.821 --> 04:17.289
<i>And so the head coach of Yale,</i>
<i>Walter Camp,</i>

04:17.291 --> 04:21.226
<i>who's known as the father</i>
<i>of American football was like,</i>

04:21.228 --> 04:24.329
<i>um, don't talk about</i>
<i>my sport that way.</i>

04:24.331 --> 04:27.799
<i>I made this sport</i>
<i>and we're not gonna change it.</i>

04:27.801 --> 04:29.868
<i>Like, football is football.</i>

04:29.870 --> 04:30.736
Suck it, bro.

04:30.738 --> 04:33.605
And so the president was
like, well,

04:33.607 --> 04:35.440
<i>this guy just told me</i>
<i>to suck it, bro.</i>

04:35.442 --> 04:37.376
And so I think the meeting
is ov--

04:37.378 --> 04:38.477
meeting is adjourned.

04:38.479 --> 04:40.345
I think the meeting
is adjourned.

04:40.347 --> 04:42.481
<i>And so they didn't come</i>
<i>to any sort of agreement,</i>

04:42.483 --> 04:46.184
<i>and at the end of that season,</i>
<i>the newsboys were like,</i>

04:46.186 --> 04:47.219
<i>extra, extra!</i>

04:47.221 --> 04:48.553
<i>Read all about it!</i>

04:48.555 --> 04:50.756
<i>18 s-deaths--</i>

04:50.758 --> 04:52.991
I was gonna say serious deaths.

04:52.993 --> 04:53.659
[laughs]

04:53.661 --> 04:56.528
There are deaths that are,
like, eh.

04:56.530 --> 04:58.030
It's kind of funny.

04:58.899 --> 05:00.599
<i>18 deaths</i>

05:00.601 --> 05:03.769

05:03.771 --> 05:04.836
<i>Shit.</i>

05:04.838 --> 05:06.972
<i>Fatalities means death.</i>

05:06.974 --> 05:11.543

<i>and 159 super serious injuries</i>

05:20.521 --> 05:22.954

<i>everybody back,</i>

05:22.956 --> 05:24.623
<i>and he's like, hey, y'all.</i>

05:24.625 --> 05:25.991
<i>All this stuff just happened.</i>

05:25.993 --> 05:28.593
<i>Walter Camp, I see you</i>

05:28.595 --> 05:29.995

<i>We have to change your sport.</i>

05:31.632 --> 05:33.165
<i>I get that it's your baby,</i>

05:33.167 --> 05:35.033
<i>but sometimes your baby sucks.</i>

05:35.035 --> 05:37.102

05:37.104 --> 05:38.537
do whatever
the [bleep] you want,

05:38.539 --> 05:40.839
it's gonna punch people

05:40.841 --> 05:44.076
Your baby needs to be raised
properly in a decent home,

05:44.078 --> 05:47.646
and the decent home is
let's make some new rules.

05:47.648 --> 05:49.815
<i>So, like, what if--</i>
<i>crazy thought--</i>

05:49.817 --> 05:53.318
<i>what if we make first down</i>
<i>instead of five yards,</i>

05:53.320 --> 05:54.086
<i>make it ten?</i>

05:54.088 --> 05:56.588
<i>And then he was like,</i>
<i>what if you took a ball</i>

05:56.590 --> 05:59.224
<i>and you threw it instead</i>
<i>of only just being able</i>

05:59.226 --> 06:02.728
<i>to shove into each other</i>
<i>to move down the field?</i>

06:02.730 --> 06:04.029
<i>Wouldn't that be wild?</i>

06:04.031 --> 06:05.964
<i>And people were like, wait.</i>

06:05.966 --> 06:08.133
<i>You want to throw a ball?</i>

06:08.135 --> 06:12.371
<i>Like, yeah, that's why balls</i>
<i>were invented, to be thrown.</i>

06:12.373 --> 06:15.140
<i>Walter Camp was like, okay.</i>

06:15.142 --> 06:15.741
<i>Fine.</i>

06:15.743 --> 06:20.679
<i>And so basically after that</i>
<i>meeting, there was, like,</i>

06:20.681 --> 06:26.585
<i>a national standard</i>
<i>for what football was,</i>

06:26.587 --> 06:28.153

<i>and, like, nobody knows that.</i>

06:36.563 --> 06:38.697
They just think
Teddy Roosevelt, oh, president.

07:46.466 --> 07:49.835
<i>Our story begins</i>
<i>December 7, 1941,</i>

07:49.837 --> 07:52.003
<i>and as Roosevelt</i>
<i>so incredibly said,</i>

07:52.005 --> 07:54.906
"A day that will live
in infamy."

07:54.908 --> 07:57.642
The attack on Pearl Harbor
changed everything

07:57.644 --> 07:59.411
because for two years
and three months,

07:59.413 --> 08:01.980
<i>Winston Churchill's fighting</i>
<i>this war on his own.</i>

08:01.982 --> 08:05.283
<i>Literally Winston Churchill</i>
<i>against Hitler.</i>

08:05.285 --> 08:06.718
<i>And at that point,</i>
<i>we're like, okay,</i>

08:06.720 --> 08:08.453
<i>let's just fight Japan,</i>
<i>kick their ass</i>

08:08.455 --> 08:11.423
<i>'cause this is bullshit,</i>
<i>but why the [bleep] should we</i>

08:11.425 --> 08:12.357
<i>go over to Europe?</i>

08:12.359 --> 08:14.025
<i>Another one of their dumb wars?</i>

08:14.027 --> 08:16.294
<i>Who's this Hitler guy?</i>

08:16.296 --> 08:17.262
<i>FDR believed Churchill,</i>

08:17.264 --> 08:20.232
<i>that this was the greatest</i>
<i>threat to human existence</i>

08:20.234 --> 08:21.900
<i>in the history of man.</i>

08:21.902 --> 08:24.469
<i>So this Christmas trip</i>
<i>was planned</i>

08:24.471 --> 08:27.939
<i>for Churchill to come over,</i>
<i>see FDR,</i>

08:27.941 --> 08:32.277
and FDR views Churchill as,
like, his party buddy.

08:32.279 --> 08:34.646
<i>And Churchill looks</i>
<i>at Alonzo Fields,</i>

08:34.648 --> 08:37.148
<i>the White House butler,</i>
<i>and says,</i>

08:37.150 --> 08:38.416
<i>"I have a few orders.</i>

08:38.418 --> 08:39.851
<i>"In the morning</i>
<i>before breakfast,</i>

08:39.853 --> 08:41.786
<i>"I would like</i>
<i>a tumbler of sherry.</i>

08:41.788 --> 08:47.092
<i>"I will need scotch and soda,</i>
<i>two of them, before lunch,</i>

08:47.094 --> 08:52.864
<i>"and before I go to sleep,</i>
<i>I must have 90-year-old brandy</i>

08:52.866 --> 08:54.799
<i>and French champagne."</i>

08:54.801 --> 08:55.834
<i>That was Churchill.</i>

08:55.836 --> 08:56.835
He partied and loved it.

08:56.837 --> 09:00.572
<i>So he and Roosevelt immediately</i>
<i>dig in and start planning</i>

09:00.574 --> 09:02.741
how they're gonna
kick Hitler's ass.

09:02.743 --> 09:03.375
Thank God.

09:03.377 --> 09:06.711
<i>And then Churchill brings in</i>
<i>his mobile map room,</i>

09:06.713 --> 09:10.048
which was this series of maps
with thumbtacks of where

09:10.050 --> 09:12.117
their troops are

09:12.119 --> 09:13.084
<i>and how they can defeat him.</i>

09:13.086 --> 09:16.421

18:26.039 --> 18:29.207
<i>Eleanor is in Moscow</i>
<i>and has a political minder</i>

18:29.209 --> 18:32.810
<i>that says, "You can't really</i>
<i>talk to anyone about anything.</i>

18:32.812 --> 18:35.046
<i>"You're gonna eat</i>
<i>some sablefish.</i>

18:35.048 --> 18:36.080
<i>"You're gonna drink some vodka.</i>

18:36.082 --> 18:40.318
<i>"You're gonna wear a furry hat</i>
<i>showing that it's not that bad</i>

18:40.320 --> 18:41.586
<i>"between Russia and America.</i>

18:41.588 --> 18:43.020
<i>That's your job, lady."</i>

18:43.022 --> 18:46.090
<i>And she's like, uh...</i>

18:46.092 --> 18:46.757
<i>no.</i>

18:46.759 --> 18:49.560
<i>I'm Eleanor goddamn Roosevelt,</i>

18:49.562 --> 18:53.164
<i>and I'm gonna go and see</i>
<i>my [bleep] pal.</i>

18:53.166 --> 18:56.067
This emissary takes
Eleanor Roosevelt

18:56.069 --> 18:58.803
to Lyudmila Pavlichenko's house.

18:58.805 --> 19:02.840
<i>This woman was a national hero,</i>
<i>but she's living</i>

19:02.842 --> 19:05.943
in this tiny
two-room apartment,

19:05.945 --> 19:08.646
<i>and Lyudmila opens the door.</i>

19:08.648 --> 19:09.747
<i>Hello, Lyudmila.</i>

19:09.749 --> 19:12.083
<i>Hello, Mrs. Roosevelt.</i>

19:12.085 --> 19:16.954
Like, Eleanor and Lyudmila
are sitting formally

19:16.956 --> 19:20.625
<i>with the Russian minder,</i>
<i>and at a certain point,</i>

19:20.627 --> 19:23.995
<i>Lyudmila makes an excuse</i>
<i>and says, "Oh, oh, oh.</i>

19:23.997 --> 19:26.164
<i>"Sorry, sorry.</i>
<i>Have to leave,"</i>

19:26.166 --> 19:29.767
<i>and finds a way</i>
<i>to take Eleanor away</i>

19:29.769 --> 19:34.071
<i>from the Russian minder,</i>
<i>and she's half-laughing,</i>

19:34.073 --> 19:36.741
half-crying, and she's hugging
Eleanor and saying,

19:36.743 --> 19:41.679
<i>"Oh, my friend, it's so good to</i>
<i>see you after all these years."</i>

19:41.681 --> 19:42.346
<i>[chuckles]</i>

19:42.348 --> 19:45.883
<i>"And think about all</i>
<i>the friends we met</i>

19:45.885 --> 19:47.385
<i>on our trip across the U.S.,"</i>

19:47.387 --> 19:50.688
and Eleanor's so happy
to talk to her, just saying,

19:50.690 --> 19:55.326
"Oh, Lyudmila, we did have
a great time, didn't we?"

19:55.328 --> 19:59.730
And these two incredibly
powerful, smart women

19:59.732 --> 20:05.236
<i>saved millions of lives by</i>
<i>engendering the American public</i>

20:05.238 --> 20:07.438
<i>into joining the war effort,</i>

20:07.440 --> 20:10.041
and it was such
an important part of history,

20:10.043 --> 20:15.179
but it's just two women happy
to see each other and saying,

20:15.181 --> 20:19.116
<i>"Do you remember that time</i>
<i>we went to Chicago?"</i>

20:19.118 --> 20:20.384
<i>Shit.</i>

20:20.386 --> 20:21.319
<i>[groans]</i>

20:21.321 --> 20:23.120
<i>God damn it.</i>

20:23.122 --> 20:25.122
I think it's really touching.

20:28.094 --> 20:30.161
