01:22.472 --> 01:23.717
Welcome to Miami.

01:23.974 --> 01:27.389
While in the airport, please
observe Florida laws...

01:27.602 --> 01:30.010
...which prohibit smoking
in the terminal.

01:30.271 --> 01:32.560
Thank you for not smoking.

02:50.936 --> 02:53.971
Your son-in-law dealt with the
dry cleaning franchise during the day.

02:54.188 --> 02:56.346
He saw that woman every night.

02:58.275 --> 03:02.487
The specifics are in my report,
and information about the woman.

03:04.281 --> 03:06.108
It's unpleasant, I know.

03:06.992 --> 03:08.617
Discreet, isn't he?

03:09.079 --> 03:10.870
What an imbecile!

03:11.206 --> 03:14.373
I tried to warn my daughter,
but what can you do?

03:14.584 --> 03:17.419
I worry about the children.

03:17.629 --> 03:19.918
My invoice is in the envelope,
if that's all.

03:20.590 --> 03:22.665
Yes, Mr. Welles. Thank you.

03:23.259 --> 03:26.710
Senator, let me know if I can be
of further assistance to you.

03:26.970 --> 03:28.594
I'll be in touch.

04:06.175 --> 04:07.550
Hello?

04:08.093 --> 04:09.552
You're home.

04:10.345 --> 04:11.970
We're back here.

04:13.182 --> 04:14.047
How did it go?

04:14.308 --> 04:15.387
I think very well.

04:15.642 --> 04:16.805
Good.

04:17.101 --> 04:19.011
Daddy's home, sweetie.

04:20.232 --> 04:22.308
How's the textbook business?

04:23.194 --> 04:26.693
I got 10,000 words on
the FederaI Theatre project.

04:26.947 --> 04:30.281
It should be 4000 and the writer
doesn't want to change anything.

04:30.534 --> 04:31.910
So, kind of bad.

04:33.329 --> 04:34.871
How was Miami?

04:35.122 --> 04:36.533
Fine. Lonesome.

04:36.791 --> 04:38.782
Couldn't pay me enough
to live down there.

04:39.084 --> 04:40.661
Then why'd you go?

04:41.127 --> 04:44.294
Senator Michaelson
has powerfuI friends.

04:50.011 --> 04:52.087
Hello, Cinderella.

04:52.806 --> 04:54.882
Did you miss me?
I sure missed you.

04:55.141 --> 04:56.683
Oh, that's my girI.

04:56.935 --> 04:59.260
She missed you.
I missed you.

05:00.772 --> 05:02.052
You been smoking?

05:03.608 --> 05:05.268
Smoking? I'm not smoking.

05:06.528 --> 05:08.319
Come on, honey.

05:08.947 --> 05:10.489
You reek of it.

05:11.241 --> 05:14.075
Amy, I've been sitting around
in bars following this guy.

05:14.326 --> 05:16.200
Is this the first thing I get?

05:16.412 --> 05:19.116
- You're accusing me?
- I'm not accusing you.

05:20.124 --> 05:23.078
I'm not smoking, okay?
We've been all through that.

05:24.169 --> 05:26.328
I'll make dinner.
Are you hungry?

05:26.588 --> 05:27.502
You're cooking?

05:32.012 --> 05:34.170
I missed you.

05:39.519 --> 05:41.844
I don't like it when you leave.

05:46.651 --> 05:48.110
Should I go?

05:48.695 --> 05:50.188
I'm going to do it.

06:01.832 --> 06:03.113
Come on.

06:03.375 --> 06:06.210
What's all the trouble, Cinderella?

06:06.921 --> 06:08.545
There, there.

06:17.431 --> 06:19.389
I love you.

06:22.354 --> 06:23.729
I love you.

06:37.284 --> 06:39.443
Honey, phone!

06:48.213 --> 06:49.790
Okay, I've got it!

06:50.048 --> 06:52.717
Sorry, I was just switching phones.

06:56.596 --> 06:59.052
It's a pleasure to make
your acquaintance, Mr. Longdale.

06:59.307 --> 07:01.465
How can I be of assistance to you?

07:06.897 --> 07:08.806
Four o'clock would be fine.

07:12.987 --> 07:14.896
I think I know where it is.

07:55.902 --> 07:58.475
DanieI Longdale.
We spoke on the phone.

07:58.738 --> 07:59.568
Pleasure.

07:59.781 --> 08:02.900
I'm the Christians' attorney and
an executor of the estate.

08:03.159 --> 08:04.238
This is Mrs. Christian.

08:04.494 --> 08:06.202
An honour to meet you.

08:06.496 --> 08:08.821
You come highly
recommended, Mr. Welles.

08:09.082 --> 08:13.125
I've spoken to associates of mine in
Harrisburg, Lancaster and Hershey.

08:13.335 --> 08:14.912
You have influentiaI friends.

08:15.128 --> 08:18.083
I've been privileged to provide
services for people I admire.

08:18.299 --> 08:20.755
You were praised
for your discretion...

08:21.010 --> 08:24.344
...your strict adherence
to confidentiality.

08:24.597 --> 08:25.427
Thank you.

08:28.684 --> 08:31.769
As you know,
my husband passed away recently.

08:32.020 --> 08:34.227
My condolences, Mrs. Christian.

08:34.440 --> 08:39.565
His passing has left me
with something of a dilemma.

08:39.986 --> 08:42.110
I'll do whatever I can to help.

08:43.073 --> 08:45.363
My husband's inner sanctum.

08:45.618 --> 08:48.322
Not many people have been
inside this room.

08:50.831 --> 08:52.622
My father worked the Pittsburgh mill.

08:52.874 --> 08:55.081
Irving United SteeI, I believe.

08:55.335 --> 08:57.743
But you attended Penn
on an academic scholarship.

08:57.963 --> 08:59.077
That's right.

08:59.297 --> 09:01.835
Peers went into law and finance.
You chose surveillance.

09:02.050 --> 09:03.877
I decided it was the future.

09:04.345 --> 09:05.839
Your husband is a legend.

09:06.139 --> 09:07.088
Please.

09:07.348 --> 09:09.886
We were married 45 years.

09:10.143 --> 09:13.393
Four children, seven grandchildren.

09:13.855 --> 09:15.563
But his true passion lay...

09:15.773 --> 09:17.054
...in his work.

09:17.317 --> 09:19.143
But he was always loyaI.

09:19.360 --> 09:22.396
I loved him deeply.

09:22.821 --> 09:24.280
I understand.

09:26.658 --> 09:28.034
DanieI.

09:28.744 --> 09:32.409
My husband was the only one
with the combination to this safe.

09:32.622 --> 09:34.282
We hired somebody to open it.

09:34.708 --> 09:36.747
I prevented anyone...

09:36.960 --> 09:39.167
...from seeing the contents.

09:39.379 --> 09:42.464
I felt these were
my husband's private things.

09:42.758 --> 09:43.837
I didn't...

09:45.636 --> 09:47.675
I didn't realize...

09:48.513 --> 09:50.839
Do you want to tell me
what you found?

09:53.477 --> 09:55.469
Cash, stock certificates.

09:55.687 --> 09:59.980
Nothing out of the ordinary,
really, except that.

10:01.901 --> 10:03.015
It's a film...

10:05.237 --> 10:07.360
...where a girI appears to be murdered.

10:07.573 --> 10:09.317
I'm not sure I understand.

10:09.575 --> 10:11.153
It's very realistic.

10:11.369 --> 10:14.572
But how many people seem to be
realistically killed...

10:14.789 --> 10:16.700
...in movies and on TV every day?

10:17.585 --> 10:21.203
It begins as a relatively
sleazy bit of pornography...

10:21.464 --> 10:24.465
...and rapidly turns
quite violent and bloody.

10:29.764 --> 10:32.516
What you're talking about
is called a snuff film.

10:32.725 --> 10:35.050
Snuff films are a kind of urban myth.

10:35.811 --> 10:38.646
Sex industry folkIore.
There's no such thing.

10:38.897 --> 10:40.689
That's what I explained
to Mrs. Christian.

10:40.899 --> 10:43.390
This is probably
an S & M film of some sort.

10:43.652 --> 10:45.609
Simulated rape, simulated violence.

10:45.863 --> 10:48.104
It's hard to stomach,
but there are ways of doing it.

10:48.365 --> 10:49.943
Fake blood, speciaI effects.

10:50.158 --> 10:53.362
Would you look at the film
and give us your opinion?

10:53.996 --> 10:55.158
AII I want...

10:55.372 --> 10:59.666
...is to know that
this atrocity is false.

11:00.294 --> 11:02.002
I want the proof.

12:57.242 --> 12:58.108
Well...

12:58.368 --> 13:01.488
...whoever made the film
was adept at authenticity.

13:01.747 --> 13:05.412
But I'm no expert.
Let the police make a determination.

13:05.625 --> 13:06.455
Out of the question.

13:06.710 --> 13:09.462
That'd be so unnecessary
for any number of reasons...

13:09.713 --> 13:12.880
...not the least of which is
Mr. Christian's reputation.

13:14.468 --> 13:16.377
Find out who made this film...

13:16.636 --> 13:18.428
...and establish whether it's reaI.

13:18.847 --> 13:20.222
You can name your price.

13:20.474 --> 13:24.258
You'll be provided with
whatever you need to buy information.

13:26.647 --> 13:28.556
GirI's all I've got to go on.

13:28.815 --> 13:30.606
I could treat it
like a missing persons case.

13:30.816 --> 13:31.730
Understood.

13:31.984 --> 13:32.933
Of course...

13:33.194 --> 13:36.894
...we need to be assured
that you would not copy this film.

13:37.156 --> 13:38.947
You have my word on that.

13:39.408 --> 13:41.401
But I'll be dealing
directly with you...

13:41.619 --> 13:42.568
...and only you.

13:42.828 --> 13:44.655
Your relationship with
your attorney is your own.

13:44.872 --> 13:46.829
- No offense.
- None taken.

13:47.083 --> 13:50.334
I realize you've given this
carefuI consideration.

13:52.130 --> 13:53.293
You could have destroyed it.

13:53.507 --> 13:56.128
Tell me the poor girI wasn't killed.

13:56.343 --> 13:57.671
Please?

13:57.928 --> 13:59.755
Find her alive.

14:00.013 --> 14:02.172
I'll do the best I can, ma'am.

14:43.556 --> 14:44.386
Cleveland?

14:44.599 --> 14:45.630
You just got home.

14:45.892 --> 14:48.596
I wish I could stay,
but this is the mortgage.

14:48.853 --> 14:50.312
It's Cindy's college money.

14:50.563 --> 14:52.805
If I do right by her,
with the circle she runs in...

14:53.065 --> 14:54.476
...this could be a big break.

14:54.734 --> 14:56.109
Do we need a break?

14:56.319 --> 14:58.311
Your father thinks we do.

15:01.033 --> 15:04.152
So, what was Mrs. Christian like?

15:04.411 --> 15:07.910
Like you'd expect, I guess.
I feeI sorry for her.

15:08.165 --> 15:09.196
It's a missing persons.

15:09.416 --> 15:12.084
I told her I'd give it
a couple of weeks. Three.

15:12.793 --> 15:15.830
It can't take longer than that.
It's an outside shot.

15:16.088 --> 15:20.168
That's all I can tell you.
Sometimes you can't know what I'm doing.

15:20.884 --> 15:22.711
It's always that way.

15:24.054 --> 15:27.387
- She's awake. I'll get her.
- I'll be up in a sec.

15:56.293 --> 15:58.333
- You're taking the gun?
- I won't need it.

15:58.546 --> 15:59.376
Don't take it.

15:59.630 --> 16:02.417
I won't wear it.
It's a precaution. Don't worry.

16:02.675 --> 16:05.296
Will you call me
when you get there, please?

16:21.028 --> 16:25.157
I've been hired by a couple in
Philadelphia, a doctor and his wife.

16:25.408 --> 16:28.657
A few days ago, they picked up
a girl hitchhiking off 81...

16:28.910 --> 16:30.986
...a runaway, about 18, maybe.

16:31.246 --> 16:34.995
They buy her a meal.
The doctor tries to convince her...

16:35.250 --> 16:37.456
...that, at least,
she should call home.

16:37.711 --> 16:40.249
Not surprisingly, the girl ate,
excused herself...

16:40.464 --> 16:42.088
...that was the last they saw of her.

16:42.340 --> 16:45.507
We had a friend of mine
at the department work up a sketch.

16:45.844 --> 16:47.967
They want to see
if I can I.D. this girI...

16:48.221 --> 16:50.344
...then pass along
a message to the parents...

16:50.599 --> 16:52.638
...letting them know
the kid's alive.

16:53.727 --> 16:55.636
You don't mind if I run a check?

16:55.854 --> 16:57.182
Go ahead.

16:58.148 --> 17:00.639
You want it, you got it.
Knock yourself out.

17:00.901 --> 17:04.269
Anywhere from 850,000 to 1,000,000
missing every year.

17:04.528 --> 17:07.980
We got as much as we can on computer,
then it's the wet-thumb method.

17:08.199 --> 17:10.523
Files are by state
and year of disappearance.

17:10.785 --> 17:13.323
Children are separate.
No eating or smoking.

17:13.579 --> 17:15.323
- There's coffee.
- Any good?

17:15.539 --> 17:16.654
Horrible.

17:16.915 --> 17:18.873
It'll be your best friend
after a few days...

17:19.126 --> 17:20.667
...if you last that long.

17:20.920 --> 17:22.118
Good luck.

17:26.009 --> 17:27.338
Honey, it's me.

17:27.594 --> 17:28.424
How are you?

17:28.679 --> 17:29.710
I'm good.

17:29.972 --> 17:30.920
Where are you?

17:31.181 --> 17:34.016
I'm still in Cleveland.
How's Cindy?

17:34.267 --> 17:37.304
She's sweet.
She's sleeping.

17:37.688 --> 17:41.020
- I'm missing you bigtime.
- Yeah, I miss you too.

17:41.899 --> 17:43.892
I'll call you tomorrow night.

17:44.610 --> 17:45.808
Good night.

17:46.028 --> 17:47.772
Good night, sweetheart.

18:31.949 --> 18:34.073
Hello, Mrs. Christian?
Tom Welles.

18:34.328 --> 18:35.526
Here's where we stand.

18:35.787 --> 18:39.203
I checked the film stock.
It's called Supralux 5-4-4.

18:39.458 --> 18:43.041
The company that made that
stock discontinued it in '92.

18:43.253 --> 18:45.625
So the film was made prior to that?

18:45.839 --> 18:48.674
Yes. I'm probably being
overly thorough with this...

18:48.926 --> 18:52.091
...but you might dig up your husband's
financiaI records...

18:52.345 --> 18:53.969
...about 6 or 7 years ago.

18:54.222 --> 18:56.891
See if there's anything
out of the ordinary.

18:57.099 --> 19:00.718
This isn't a movie you drop off
at the one-hour photo.

19:00.937 --> 19:02.728
So you think it's one of a kind.

19:02.980 --> 19:06.396
The film is what we've got.
There's no negative.

19:07.026 --> 19:09.775
Unlike video, it's not
designed to be duplicated.

19:10.026 --> 19:12.102
Whatever this is,
I have a feeling...

19:12.362 --> 19:15.279
...there aren't many copies
floating around, if any.

19:15.490 --> 19:19.155
I'm looking for a girl
we're not even sure is missing.

19:19.410 --> 19:22.115
With this happening 6 or 7 years ago...

19:22.372 --> 19:26.582
...finding the guys who made this film
is going to be very difficult.

19:26.834 --> 19:29.870
I know you can do it.
You're doing a wonderful job.

19:30.129 --> 19:33.248
Please tell me you'll
continue the investigation.

19:33.507 --> 19:35.546
I will. I'll keep trying for you.

19:35.759 --> 19:38.297
You can count on me.
Goodbye, Mrs. Christian.

19:39.721 --> 19:44.016
We can't come to the phone now,
so please leave a message at the beep.

19:44.269 --> 19:45.300
Honey, it's me.

19:45.520 --> 19:48.521
I'm sorry I forgot
to call last night.

19:48.773 --> 19:50.398
I won't forget tonight.

19:50.650 --> 19:53.485
I've been gone a long time.
I hope I'll be home soon.

19:53.736 --> 19:56.572
I love you, and I miss you.
We'll talk tonight.

21:18.862 --> 21:20.820
You looking for Janet?

21:27.413 --> 21:29.370
Hello, Mrs. Mathews?

21:29.581 --> 21:32.203
I'm Thomas Hart.
I'm a licensed investigator.

21:32.501 --> 21:35.952
I've been hired by the U.S. Resource
Centre, Missing Persons...

21:36.213 --> 21:37.791
...as part of an internaI audit.

21:38.048 --> 21:43.173
I'd like you to answer questions
about your daughter, Mary Anne.

21:43.429 --> 21:47.591
I spoke to your FBI contact
yesterday, Agent...

21:47.849 --> 21:49.343
NeiI. NeiI Cole?

21:49.600 --> 21:53.894
Yes, Agent Cole. He told me
he'd call and let you know to expect me.

21:54.647 --> 21:56.355
He didn't call?

22:02.614 --> 22:03.444
Is this you?

22:05.702 --> 22:07.741
You look about five years old.

22:08.204 --> 22:09.070
A little older.

22:09.331 --> 22:10.529
Sweet.

22:13.585 --> 22:18.710
It's important that you don't
let this raise your expectations.

22:19.215 --> 22:22.466
It's not going to effect
any ongoing efforts.

22:23.218 --> 22:25.211
AII I'm saying is, please know...

22:25.471 --> 22:28.222
...I'm not here to create
any false hope.

22:32.102 --> 22:35.222
We fought all the time,
Mary Anne and me...

22:35.481 --> 22:36.643
...and her stepdad.

22:36.899 --> 22:38.559
She hated him...

22:38.817 --> 22:40.893
...because he wasn't her reaI dad.

22:41.570 --> 22:44.571
Trouble here, trouble at schooI.

22:44.823 --> 22:45.938
Trouble.

22:46.450 --> 22:50.068
Didn't like rules.
Takes after me, I guess.

22:50.329 --> 22:52.571
I had to learn the hard way.

22:54.166 --> 22:55.910
Can I speak to your husband?

22:56.168 --> 22:57.082
Her stepfather?

22:57.336 --> 22:58.367
Dave?

22:58.628 --> 22:59.956
Gone.

23:00.421 --> 23:02.794
Two years after Mary Anne left.

23:03.174 --> 23:06.210
All the time, she resented him.

23:06.468 --> 23:10.252
I lost her because of him,
and then I lost him.

23:10.848 --> 23:13.006
I'm the only one still here.

23:14.434 --> 23:16.261
Did Mary have a boyfriend?

23:16.521 --> 23:19.142
She was sneaking out with someone.

23:19.524 --> 23:21.481
She wouldn't tell me who.

23:21.776 --> 23:25.110
Coming home with hickeys,
Iying all the time.

23:26.823 --> 23:30.239
I am sorry to bring this up,
but in these circumstances...

23:30.493 --> 23:32.118
...with the stepfather...

23:32.370 --> 23:35.489
...were there any indications
of any sort of abuse?

23:35.831 --> 23:38.748
There was nothing like that.
The police and FBI asked.

23:39.001 --> 23:42.251
There wasn't anything like that.
She'd have told me.

23:42.463 --> 23:45.167
I apologize. I had to ask.

23:46.300 --> 23:50.712
Those are for her birthday.
One for every year she missed.

23:50.971 --> 23:53.640
They'll be waiting for her
when she comes back.

23:55.684 --> 23:57.641
It's because I slapped her.

23:59.396 --> 24:00.511
I know.

24:02.316 --> 24:06.611
We was fighting about Dave,
and she was just pushing my buttons.

24:06.863 --> 24:08.238
And I slapped her.

24:10.199 --> 24:11.397
Jesus!

24:12.826 --> 24:14.107
Next day, she was gone.

24:15.412 --> 24:18.199
When kids run, they
almost always leave a note.

24:18.457 --> 24:19.572
It's guilt, usually.

24:19.833 --> 24:21.541
There wasn't one.

24:21.835 --> 24:22.950
Police looked.

24:23.212 --> 24:25.833
An abduction's one thing,
a runaway's another.

24:26.090 --> 24:29.376
Sometimes it's not the priority
for the police it should be.

24:29.677 --> 24:33.841
There wasn't anything.
Don't you think I wish there was?

24:34.182 --> 24:36.638
You're probably right,
but would you let me look?

24:38.520 --> 24:40.097
You tell me...

24:40.355 --> 24:42.561
...not to get my hopes up...

24:43.066 --> 24:46.066
...not to raise my expectations.

24:50.114 --> 24:51.442
Go ahead.

24:51.990 --> 24:53.401
I need a drink.

24:54.743 --> 24:56.072
Thank you.

26:44.435 --> 26:46.262
Dear Mom,
if you're reading this...

26:46.521 --> 26:49.558
...it means I called you
from Hollywood, California.

26:49.817 --> 26:53.861
I left my diary behind because
I want you to see why I'm leaving.

26:54.071 --> 26:55.814
It's not because you hit me.

26:56.073 --> 26:59.157
I hid this so Dave the dickhead
wouldn't find it.

26:59.451 --> 27:01.490
Warren Anderson and me
are in love.

27:01.744 --> 27:03.986
I'm going to start
a new life with him.

27:04.205 --> 27:06.079
His dad owns
that garage in town.

27:06.624 --> 27:09.245
But Warren has even bigger plans.

27:09.501 --> 27:11.458
He'll become a star
in action movies.

27:11.712 --> 27:14.463
He says I'm prettier
than a lot of girls in movies.

27:14.715 --> 27:15.995
I could be a star too.

27:16.425 --> 27:17.836
You want a drink?

27:18.260 --> 27:19.884
When we cruise into Hollywood...

27:20.137 --> 27:24.715
...I'll have fiery eyes that everyone
will notice, because I am in love.

27:27.019 --> 27:29.770
You were right.
I didn't find anything.

27:30.814 --> 27:31.977
Fixed you a drink.

27:32.232 --> 27:34.604
Thanks, no.
I've got work to do.

27:34.860 --> 27:36.769
I'll stop by tomorrow night.

27:37.738 --> 27:40.276
We'll probably be married
by the time you read this.

27:41.658 --> 27:44.030
Don't come looking for me,
because I'm not coming back.

27:44.285 --> 27:47.986
Maybe someday you'll see me
on TV or in magazines.

27:48.247 --> 27:51.414
Don't worry about me.
Love, Mary Anne.

27:51.793 --> 27:53.500
Mr. Anderson?

27:55.755 --> 27:56.585
Who's asking?

27:56.798 --> 27:59.633
Tom Hart.
Excuse me not shaking hands.

28:00.553 --> 28:03.803
I'm looking for your son.
You've got a son named Warren, right?

28:04.057 --> 28:05.255
Sure.

28:06.267 --> 28:08.889
What's it about? You a cop?

28:09.104 --> 28:10.218
No, sir.

28:10.438 --> 28:13.854
Just a friend from a while back.
Owe him some money.

28:14.651 --> 28:16.394
You owe him money?

28:16.653 --> 28:17.933
That's a new one.

28:19.947 --> 28:22.402
You can leave it
right here if you want.

28:23.117 --> 28:25.904
If it's all the same,
I'd like to send it to him.

28:26.370 --> 28:27.829
California, right?

28:29.581 --> 28:31.206
California?

28:32.501 --> 28:35.751
Son, you know where
the Fayetteville lockup is?

28:36.255 --> 28:38.247
That's where Warren is.

28:38.507 --> 28:40.963
Doing eight months on a B and E.

28:44.304 --> 28:45.467
Thank you.

28:48.517 --> 28:50.925
Yeah, man, I knew her.

28:52.187 --> 28:54.856
Dumped that bitch right
before I moved to L.A.

28:55.273 --> 28:58.143
She shows up knocking at my door
like a fucking stalker.

28:58.776 --> 29:00.983
Told that bitch she could go to hell.

29:03.031 --> 29:04.193
Where'd she go?

29:06.242 --> 29:07.784
Hell, maybe.

29:08.786 --> 29:11.574
I don't know and
I don't give a fuck, either.

29:13.250 --> 29:16.168
She said she might work
at a titty bar or something.

29:16.795 --> 29:19.333
Ask me, her tits
weren't all that great.

29:21.008 --> 29:22.467
Did you hear from her again?

29:24.803 --> 29:27.840
Because I fucked her
doesn't mean I wanted her there.

29:28.515 --> 29:31.800
She came to Hollywood to be
a big fucking movie star.

29:32.393 --> 29:34.967
And so did I.
Check me out now.

29:39.609 --> 29:42.444
Why don't you pass me
one of them smokes?

29:49.202 --> 29:50.577
I don't smoke.

29:54.999 --> 29:56.458
How you doing?

29:56.709 --> 29:57.623
I'm okay.

29:57.835 --> 29:59.794
You don't sound okay.

30:00.172 --> 30:01.880
It's not easy.

30:02.091 --> 30:03.371
Why? What's going on?

30:03.759 --> 30:06.379
It's just tougher than
I thought it would be.

30:06.594 --> 30:07.923
Is it getting to you?

30:08.179 --> 30:09.757
I got a lead I can't drop.

30:10.014 --> 30:11.971
I'm almost done.
I miss you.

30:12.392 --> 30:13.802
I miss you too.
I love you.

30:14.060 --> 30:15.602
Give Cindy a kiss for me.

30:15.853 --> 30:19.020
Wait, I think she wants to say bye.
Say bye to Daddy.

30:19.232 --> 30:21.901
Hi, sweetie. Hi, honey.

30:22.443 --> 30:23.524
Hi, Cinderella.

30:23.779 --> 30:26.021
She's touching the phone.

30:27.032 --> 30:29.488
You should see her face
at your voice.

30:30.160 --> 30:31.109
I love you.

30:31.328 --> 30:33.866
I love you too. Bye.

30:36.375 --> 30:38.368
I was just making dinner.

30:38.669 --> 30:41.585
I've made enough for two,
as it happens.

30:41.838 --> 30:43.747
I'm sorry, I can't stay.

30:44.007 --> 30:47.625
I wanted to let you know
I spoke to my people at the agency.

30:47.886 --> 30:50.886
I told them to keep
Mary Anne's case active.

30:52.056 --> 30:53.467
Well...

30:54.225 --> 30:57.475
...stay for a drink, at least.

31:01.396 --> 31:03.056
You sure you're not hungry?

31:03.273 --> 31:06.144
It'd be nice to have a meaI
without the TV on for once.

31:07.110 --> 31:08.688
I have a long drive ahead of me.

31:08.945 --> 31:11.816
It's one of the most
depressing things. Eating alone.

31:12.032 --> 31:15.531
I don't know why. You think
I'd be used to it by now.

31:26.587 --> 31:27.618
Mrs. Mathews?

31:28.881 --> 31:30.161
Janet.

31:31.592 --> 31:32.872
Do you ever consider...

31:33.469 --> 31:36.257
Do you realize that
Mary may never come back?

31:37.891 --> 31:40.014
I think about it every day.

31:40.685 --> 31:42.228
Every time the phone rings...

31:42.479 --> 31:45.812
...every time, I still think it's her.

31:46.525 --> 31:48.813
She's all I think about.

31:50.529 --> 31:52.188
Can you tell me...

31:53.114 --> 31:56.779
...if you had to make a choice,
if you were forced to choose...

31:57.369 --> 32:00.738
...between imagining her
out there somewhere...

32:00.997 --> 32:04.117
...living a good life, being happy...

32:05.544 --> 32:07.252
...but you don't know...

32:07.963 --> 32:09.754
...you never find out...

32:11.258 --> 32:13.334
...or the worst being true...

32:14.136 --> 32:15.760
...her being gone...

32:17.097 --> 32:18.639
...but you know.

32:19.516 --> 32:21.307
You finally know...

32:22.728 --> 32:24.471
...what's happened to her.

32:26.022 --> 32:27.765
What would I choose?

32:29.066 --> 32:30.062
Yes.

32:34.155 --> 32:36.064
I would choose to know.

32:38.743 --> 32:40.735
I need to know.

32:47.461 --> 32:50.545
Excuse me,
I have to use your restroom.

33:44.474 --> 33:46.099
You're leaving.

33:51.273 --> 33:53.645
I'll call you if I find anything out.

36:36.645 --> 36:37.677
How you doing?

36:38.898 --> 36:39.893
Big date tonight?

36:40.941 --> 36:42.519
Yeah, guess so.

36:42.777 --> 36:45.481
Could I interest you
in a battery-operated vagina?

36:46.322 --> 36:48.231
It's tempting, but no thanks.

36:48.616 --> 36:52.032
I'd hate to see you in one
of those everyday situations...

36:52.286 --> 36:55.406
...that calls for it
and you don't have one.

36:55.623 --> 36:57.117
I'll risk it.

36:58.667 --> 37:01.621
All right, your totaI
is $74.58, please.

37:05.132 --> 37:06.591
A hundred.

37:11.763 --> 37:15.547
TotaI's $25 and some change.

37:18.937 --> 37:21.642
Thank you for shopping
at Adult Bookstore.

37:21.898 --> 37:24.436
And have yourself a fabulous day.

37:24.776 --> 37:26.270
What are you reading?

37:28.948 --> 37:30.739
Catchy title.
What are you really reading?

37:30.950 --> 37:34.200
Hard to believe it's got
any parts worth highlighting.

37:37.540 --> 37:39.164
Capote.

37:41.127 --> 37:42.289
You know how it is.

37:42.920 --> 37:46.289
Wouldn't want to embarrass yourself
in front of your fellow perverts.

37:47.549 --> 37:50.715
I might get drummed out
of the pornographers' union.

37:50.969 --> 37:52.594
Where would I be then?

37:55.516 --> 37:57.141
Have a good day.

38:24.878 --> 38:26.076
How are you?

38:26.338 --> 38:27.832
Hey, honey.

38:28.214 --> 38:30.041
- How you doing?
- I'm a little beat.

38:30.258 --> 38:31.088
How's Cindy?

38:31.343 --> 38:33.216
She's sweet. She misses you.

38:33.428 --> 38:35.053
How's it going?

38:35.680 --> 38:38.930
The way things are going,
I'm thinking about coming home.

38:39.351 --> 38:40.265
Really?

38:41.979 --> 38:43.390
Honey, wait.

38:46.108 --> 38:47.733
Can I call you back?

38:48.611 --> 38:51.232
I'll call you right back, I promise.
Bye, honey.

39:33.903 --> 39:35.481
Mrs. Christian, there were three men.

39:35.738 --> 39:38.194
Not just the cameraman
and the masked man.

39:38.867 --> 39:41.737
I caught a glimpse of a third man.
He was watching.

39:43.538 --> 39:46.159
I'll get a clearer image
through computer enhancement.

39:46.416 --> 39:49.619
But this probably happened
6 years ago, so it's not-

39:49.919 --> 39:51.713
All right, I'll keep trying.

39:51.965 --> 39:54.752
Thank you, I appreciate
your support. Goodbye.

39:55.886 --> 39:59.052
What we have here is
137 billable man-hours...

39:59.306 --> 40:01.844
...a hundred-plus thousand
dollars machine...

40:02.100 --> 40:06.727
...and the result is an enhancement
of the back of some guy's head.

40:08.689 --> 40:10.100
Want it framed?

40:11.776 --> 40:13.934
There you go. Have a nice day.

40:15.863 --> 40:18.983
It's like a gas station,
you pay before you pump.

40:19.950 --> 40:21.493
Remember me?

40:24.121 --> 40:27.075
Came back for the battery-operated
vagina after all.

40:27.750 --> 40:30.075
I need information.
Maybe you can help.

40:30.294 --> 40:33.378
Thomas Welles. Nice picture.

40:33.881 --> 40:37.131
What sort of information?
I got all different kinds.

40:37.343 --> 40:38.457
The kind I'll pay for.

40:39.470 --> 40:41.878
I don't know
what you're looking for...

40:42.139 --> 40:44.261
...so we're clear from the start,
I'm straight.

40:44.516 --> 40:45.630
Congratulations.

40:45.892 --> 40:47.007
Thank you.

40:47.268 --> 40:48.182
Zip it!

40:48.436 --> 40:49.717
I can hook you up.

40:49.979 --> 40:51.723
Name the vice,
I name the price.

40:52.399 --> 40:55.602
- How long you been working here?
- Almost two years.

40:55.860 --> 40:57.983
What's your name,
if you don't mind me asking?

40:58.238 --> 40:59.780
Max.

41:01.116 --> 41:02.065
Here's the deaI.

41:02.326 --> 41:05.078
This thing has to do
with underground pornography.

41:05.329 --> 41:08.081
Stuff that's sold
under the counter, illegally.

41:08.332 --> 41:10.491
There's not much illegaI out there.

41:10.751 --> 41:14.369
Whatever there is, I want to know.
I want a good look.

41:14.630 --> 41:18.462
If you've got that kind of
connection, great. If not, speak now.

41:18.843 --> 41:20.217
You're not a cop, are you?

41:20.468 --> 41:22.675
If I ask and you are,
you got to tell me.

41:22.929 --> 41:24.471
I'm not a cop.

41:25.348 --> 41:26.546
A private detective?

41:26.808 --> 41:28.267
Like Shaft?

41:29.144 --> 41:31.813
You ever seen Private Dicks?
I got it on sale.

41:32.063 --> 41:33.688
How much you make in there?

41:36.359 --> 41:39.645
Around 400 bucks a week,
off the books.

41:39.821 --> 41:42.146
Let's pretend I live
in the same fantasy world...

41:42.407 --> 41:44.483
...where you make $400
a week in that dump.

41:44.743 --> 41:46.949
I'll give you 500 for a few days.

41:47.203 --> 41:48.448
Six sounds good, Pops.

41:48.705 --> 41:49.951
Five.

41:51.334 --> 41:53.077
Here's my number.

41:57.213 --> 41:58.921
When can you start?

41:59.341 --> 42:02.045
Well, tomorrow night I get off late.

42:03.053 --> 42:04.048
Tomorrow.

42:04.304 --> 42:05.169
All right.

42:05.430 --> 42:08.384
And don't call me Pops.

42:09.017 --> 42:12.220
Of course not. I wouldn't
want to hurt your feelings.

42:14.690 --> 42:16.564
I don't know what your scene is.

42:16.817 --> 42:18.644
You may like porn
as much as the next guy.

42:18.903 --> 42:22.651
You don't look like your average
sleaze. More like your average cop.

42:22.865 --> 42:26.400
So when you ask people
about fucking illegal stuff...

42:26.661 --> 42:28.618
...it has a certain patina to it.

42:28.829 --> 42:29.695
Patina.

42:29.956 --> 42:31.994
It's a Truman Capote word. Hello?

42:32.249 --> 42:35.949
If someone never sold a snuff film,
they shouldn't care what I ask.

42:36.211 --> 42:38.168
If they have,
they should be nervous.

42:38.421 --> 42:41.043
Whoever acts insulted,
knock on their door.

42:41.299 --> 42:45.214
Look, Pops, it's not too late
to change your mind about all this.

42:45.470 --> 42:48.254
There's things you'll see
that you can't unsee.

42:48.512 --> 42:51.845
- They stay in your head.
- How do you know what I've seen?

42:52.057 --> 42:55.307
Okay, fine.
But everybody's got their limit.

42:55.561 --> 42:59.060
I've been here six fucking years
trying to get my music together.

42:59.314 --> 43:02.849
So I start part-time
where I work, to make ends meet.

43:03.110 --> 43:06.525
And boom, a couple years go by,
and here I am.

43:06.779 --> 43:10.444
I'm just saying, before you know it,
you're in it. Deep in it.

43:10.700 --> 43:12.324
Don't worry about me.

43:12.577 --> 43:13.490
But thank you.

43:13.744 --> 43:15.452
You're welcome.

43:15.955 --> 43:19.075
Pops, you dance with the deviI,
the deviI don't change.

43:19.417 --> 43:21.208
DeviI changes you.

43:21.586 --> 43:22.831
Some of your Iyrics?

43:23.045 --> 43:23.876
That's cute.

43:35.267 --> 43:37.343
This place has been around
about 3 years...

43:37.603 --> 43:39.975
...but they keep moving it
house to house.

43:56.413 --> 43:58.322
This is the tip of the iceberg.

43:58.582 --> 44:01.417
Lots of Mexican S & M,
lots of Asian bondage...

44:01.668 --> 44:04.835
...all kinds of bestiality,
if you're into that.

44:05.047 --> 44:07.336
Don't touch nothing.
You want something, tell Friendly.

44:07.549 --> 44:08.545
Ask him.

44:21.104 --> 44:22.302
Don't do that!

44:22.647 --> 44:24.022
All right! It's cooI!

44:25.900 --> 44:27.015
All right? Okay.

44:35.327 --> 44:37.367
Come on, let's go. All right!

44:41.458 --> 44:44.412
Are you affiliated with law enforcement?

44:44.670 --> 44:45.950
Fuck you, Larry.

44:46.213 --> 44:50.211
Are you a law enforcement agent,
or affiliated with law enforcement?

44:50.467 --> 44:51.665
Fuck you, Larry.

44:51.927 --> 44:53.800
You're getting cooI there, Welles.

44:54.053 --> 44:57.802
You got your porn zombies here.
Junkies for the hard stuff.

44:58.057 --> 45:00.264
But these sales
won't last much longer.

45:00.518 --> 45:02.641
It's risky,
and everything's on the Net.

45:02.895 --> 45:05.137
Chicken hawks swapping photos
with their modems.

45:05.398 --> 45:08.981
Then there's classified ads
with hidden codes, secret couriers...

45:09.235 --> 45:11.228
...wires through dummy corporations.

45:11.487 --> 45:14.654
If something's illegaI, the buyers
are as far away as they can get.

45:14.907 --> 45:17.908
Nobody knows what nobody knows,
you know what I mean?

45:18.119 --> 45:19.578
How's it going, SamueI?

45:24.417 --> 45:25.995
I'll say hi to her.

45:26.586 --> 45:28.376
How are you? I love that.

45:28.628 --> 45:31.202
It's the MichaeI Jackson look,
with the zippers.

46:03.415 --> 46:04.956
What are these?

46:05.917 --> 46:07.708
Extreme bondage.

46:08.086 --> 46:09.628
Rape films.

46:10.546 --> 46:12.206
Sick shit.

46:12.632 --> 46:15.301
Buy five, get one for free.

46:17.095 --> 46:18.589
Anything harder?

46:18.846 --> 46:21.088
There's nothing harder.

46:21.891 --> 46:22.922
Snuff?

46:25.979 --> 46:28.434
There's no such thing as snuff.

46:28.898 --> 46:31.057
What you see is what I got, mister.

46:31.276 --> 46:33.352
Do you know where I can get some?

46:33.570 --> 46:35.313
Fuck off.

47:23.493 --> 47:24.691
There she is.

47:24.952 --> 47:27.989
There she is.
It's Double Slap Dorothy.

47:28.247 --> 47:30.573
That chick could be
a baseball player.

47:30.791 --> 47:32.499
The swing on her is unreaI.

47:33.711 --> 47:37.294
Some of these S & M and bondage films
you'll see straddle the line.

47:37.548 --> 47:39.173
Foot fetish, orgies, shit films...

47:39.425 --> 47:42.047
...hermaphrodites, mutilation.
It's harder than hard-core.

47:42.303 --> 47:43.466
But mostly legaI.

47:43.721 --> 47:44.552
Stick.

47:44.807 --> 47:46.135
One guy sees it and pukes.

47:46.391 --> 47:49.345
Another guy sees it
and he falls in love.

47:50.311 --> 47:53.561
This is the guy I told you about.
Got the tapes?

47:54.816 --> 47:55.646
$1000.

47:55.900 --> 47:58.106
-1200 for the two.
- You told Max 1000.

47:58.361 --> 48:02.690
I know. This is more fun. I raise
the price, you get pissed off.

48:02.949 --> 48:05.321
- I thought we had a relationship.
- Is it reaI?

48:05.535 --> 48:08.240
Sickest shit you'll ever see.

48:13.335 --> 48:14.331
Is that reaI?

48:15.712 --> 48:17.871
That sure as shit looks reaI.

48:25.389 --> 48:27.179
She's not breathing.

48:36.399 --> 48:38.059
Who makes these films?

48:38.317 --> 48:39.728
I don't know.

48:40.069 --> 48:42.062
Looks like the Philippines.

48:47.035 --> 48:49.608
Yeah, definitely the Philippines.

49:12.642 --> 49:15.216
Wait a minute.
That's the same girI.

49:15.479 --> 49:16.937
Isn't that the same girI?

49:17.272 --> 49:18.387
Look.

49:19.942 --> 49:21.223
It is the same.

49:21.444 --> 49:22.607
They're fakes.

49:25.156 --> 49:26.816
That's great.

49:28.451 --> 49:31.654
Snuff 2.: The Resurrection.

49:31.913 --> 49:33.407
Oh, boy.

49:33.665 --> 49:36.156
Well, what do you expect for 1200?

49:38.961 --> 49:41.368
You want a beer or something?
I could use anything.

49:43.132 --> 49:46.336
But I'm sorry, man.
I told you snuff was bogus.

49:46.594 --> 49:49.346
I just wish I would have
gotten you a receipt.

49:49.889 --> 49:51.134
" Hard Spank. "

49:51.808 --> 49:53.765
" Max California. "

49:54.018 --> 49:55.927
That's my old band.

49:56.229 --> 49:57.474
We broke up.

49:57.689 --> 49:58.803
When?

49:59.148 --> 50:00.975
Maybe about a year ago.

50:02.318 --> 50:04.643
I don't mean any offense...

50:04.904 --> 50:07.442
...but what are you doing
mixed up in all this?

50:08.241 --> 50:11.111
I'm not mixed up in anything, Pops.

50:11.327 --> 50:13.948
You strike me as being smart enough
to do something else.

50:14.830 --> 50:16.110
Thanks.

50:16.373 --> 50:18.781
I wish you owned a record labeI.

50:19.585 --> 50:22.158
Look, it beats pumping gas.

50:22.796 --> 50:25.287
I don't buy it.
I don't endorse it.

50:26.008 --> 50:27.253
I just point the way.

50:28.594 --> 50:30.219
You said it gets to you.

50:30.430 --> 50:31.888
Well, hell, yeah.

50:32.140 --> 50:34.631
Parade of losers I see every day?

50:34.893 --> 50:36.600
What choices have I got?

50:36.811 --> 50:41.023
The music industry is not exactly
beating down my door.

50:42.065 --> 50:44.900
And what about you, Tom Welles?

50:45.319 --> 50:48.687
You got a ring on your finger.
You got kids?

50:49.071 --> 50:50.352
A daughter.

50:52.116 --> 50:54.322
So you got a wife and a daughter...

50:54.577 --> 50:56.404
...and a nice little yellow house...

50:56.621 --> 50:58.697
...and a dog named Shep.

50:59.040 --> 51:01.365
What the hell are you doing here?

51:04.212 --> 51:05.706
Good question.

51:08.549 --> 51:10.423
Do you get turned on
at places like tonight?

51:12.470 --> 51:13.632
No, I am not.

51:13.846 --> 51:16.171
You don't exactly
get turned off, either.

51:18.726 --> 51:20.635
DeviI's changing you already.

51:21.145 --> 51:22.770
Good night, Max.

52:01.769 --> 52:05.387
This gentleman was asking if anyone
recognizes this girI.

52:07.400 --> 52:08.562
Yes.

52:08.818 --> 52:10.193
I remember Mary.

52:10.445 --> 52:12.271
Mary Anne Mathews?

52:13.698 --> 52:17.482
She lived here for only about a month,
if I recall correctly.

52:17.744 --> 52:21.611
She didn't return one night.
Do you know what happened to her?

52:21.873 --> 52:24.827
Not yet, but I'm looking
into it for her parents.

52:25.084 --> 52:27.789
Could you get
that flowered one down for me?

52:28.421 --> 52:29.749
That's her suitcase.

52:30.006 --> 52:33.209
I'd forgotten about it
till you showed me her picture.

52:34.093 --> 52:37.960
I suppose I always
hoped she'd be back.

52:38.221 --> 52:40.048
She seemed so lost.

52:40.307 --> 52:44.055
After a time, all I could do was pray
she'd moved on to better things.

52:44.311 --> 52:46.303
Can you get this suitcase
to her people?

52:46.521 --> 52:47.766
If it's appropriate.

52:47.981 --> 52:49.440
Yes, of course. Thank you.

53:34.736 --> 53:36.729
Starlight, star bright

53:36.947 --> 53:38.738
First star I've seen tonight

53:38.991 --> 53:41.150
I wish I may, wish I might

53:41.411 --> 53:43.699
Have this wish I wish tonight

53:48.709 --> 53:52.125
The number you have reached
is no longer in service.

53:54.047 --> 53:56.717
Hello, Hollywood Wax Museum.
Can I help you?

53:58.051 --> 54:00.459
This is operator 149.
What city and listing?

54:00.721 --> 54:02.797
I don't know. Hollywood.

54:03.224 --> 54:06.178
A listing for Celebrity Films,
and I need an address.

54:06.436 --> 54:08.843
Please hold for
phone number and address.

54:33.170 --> 54:36.087
- I was here first.
- Sorry, I'll just be a couple minutes.

54:39.131 --> 54:40.127
Eddie Poole?

54:41.091 --> 54:42.550
A process server?

54:42.801 --> 54:47.095
No, I've been inquiring around if,
by any chance, you've seen this girI.

54:47.681 --> 54:48.511
You a cop?

54:48.974 --> 54:50.599
I'm a member of her family.

54:50.809 --> 54:52.885
You know how much pussy
comes through here?

54:53.145 --> 54:56.928
Please, if you'd just take a look.
It would've been a few years.

55:06.157 --> 55:08.482
Her name is Mary Anne Mathews.

55:11.162 --> 55:12.573
Never seen her.

55:13.999 --> 55:15.162
You sure?

55:16.126 --> 55:18.618
I just looked
at the picture, didn't I?

55:19.171 --> 55:21.330
Come on. I got
a lot of shit to do.

55:25.386 --> 55:26.584
Who's next?

55:59.086 --> 56:00.497
This'll be fine.

56:41.379 --> 56:43.335
What kind of shit are you peddling?

56:43.588 --> 56:45.746
My tapes sell.
People eat the shit up.

56:46.007 --> 56:48.759
I had three jerks
returning your tapes last month.

56:49.010 --> 56:52.213
You know how bad it has to be
for a jackass to come back...

56:52.472 --> 56:55.426
...with a receipt
and try to fucking return it?

56:55.684 --> 56:56.679
How bad?

56:56.935 --> 57:00.849
Get together some upscale product
where the girls still have teeth.

57:01.731 --> 57:04.222
Till then, fuck you!

57:04.651 --> 57:06.193
Does your mother have any teeth?

57:06.444 --> 57:08.686
If she does,
send her down, you fuck.

58:13.428 --> 58:15.302
He's not answering.

58:42.622 --> 58:43.785
Hey, boss.

58:44.040 --> 58:46.033
There's a case of beer in there.

58:50.422 --> 58:52.830
- How was your day?
- Great.

58:54.677 --> 58:57.547
- Everybody here?
- Everybody but one of the chicks.

58:58.013 --> 58:59.294
Been watching them?

01:00:15.674 --> 01:00:17.381
Celebrity Films.

01:00:18.802 --> 01:00:20.344
I know all about it.

01:00:20.595 --> 01:00:21.923
Yeah, you know about what?

01:00:22.180 --> 01:00:23.674
About that girI...

01:00:24.099 --> 01:00:25.759
...six years ago.

01:00:26.393 --> 01:00:28.266
I know what you did to her.

01:00:29.479 --> 01:00:30.558
Who is this?

01:00:30.814 --> 01:00:32.272
You murdered her.

01:00:32.774 --> 01:00:34.731
You and your friends.

01:00:35.693 --> 01:00:37.935
What the fuck are
you talking about?

01:00:38.154 --> 01:00:39.435
You killed her on film.

01:00:39.906 --> 01:00:41.186
Now you're fucked.

01:00:41.449 --> 01:00:43.241
You're all fucked.

01:00:57.715 --> 01:00:58.995
Come on.

01:01:05.389 --> 01:01:07.216
Come on, give me something, Eddie.

01:01:20.113 --> 01:01:21.276
It's me.

01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:23.615
What do you want?

01:01:23.867 --> 01:01:25.147
I just got a call.

01:01:25.368 --> 01:01:28.072
We got to talk.
And not on the phone.

01:01:28.287 --> 01:01:31.288
So one of us
has to get on a plane, all right?

01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:34.459
Blow me, you paranoid fuck.

01:01:37.922 --> 01:01:39.749
Fuck! Fuck!

01:01:50.268 --> 01:01:52.640
So you like to watch, paranoid fuck.

01:02:01.071 --> 01:02:03.739
Phone is listed under "D. Velvet"
in Manhattan.

01:02:03.989 --> 01:02:04.903
Dino Velvet.

01:02:05.157 --> 01:02:08.324
He's a producerldirectorlweirdo.

01:02:08.577 --> 01:02:10.155
He's like the Jim Jarmusch of S & M.

01:02:10.412 --> 01:02:11.657
How hard is his stuff?

01:02:11.914 --> 01:02:13.076
How hard do you want it?

01:02:13.332 --> 01:02:16.997
Bondage, fetish, Gothic hard-core.
Definitely not for the squeamish.

01:02:17.253 --> 01:02:18.795
Kind of hard to come by.

01:02:19.046 --> 01:02:21.538
Mostly out of the back
of bondage magazines.

01:02:21.841 --> 01:02:23.086
But he's got fans.

01:02:23.343 --> 01:02:25.632
This guy I know, he thinks it's art.

01:02:25.887 --> 01:02:29.256
He's told me Velvet will do
commissions if there's enough dough.

01:02:29.516 --> 01:02:31.473
Nothing illegaI, but borderline.

01:02:31.726 --> 01:02:34.643
If a guy wants to see
a transvestite in a rubber suit-

01:02:34.812 --> 01:02:36.057
I got the picture.

01:02:36.272 --> 01:02:38.394
Max, get in here!

01:02:39.399 --> 01:02:40.774
So...

01:02:41.067 --> 01:02:42.526
...you're going to New York?

01:02:42.777 --> 01:02:43.975
Maybe.

01:02:44.654 --> 01:02:46.397
Looking like that.

01:02:46.990 --> 01:02:48.365
You'll need me.

01:02:48.616 --> 01:02:51.985
This Frenchie guy is more
than just a fan of Velvet films.

01:02:52.203 --> 01:02:53.828
I can get you in if you want.

01:02:54.622 --> 01:02:55.903
For more money, of course.

01:02:56.165 --> 01:02:59.001
Plus expenses. I fly first class.

01:02:59.252 --> 01:03:00.876
So when are we leaving?

01:03:05.842 --> 01:03:07.217
What are you doing?

01:03:08.178 --> 01:03:11.593
Man, my first time in
the Big Bad Apple.

01:03:14.308 --> 01:03:16.265
I told you, don't film me.

01:03:16.518 --> 01:03:19.092
Fine, Howard Hughes.

01:03:29.323 --> 01:03:31.531
You didn't say it'd be this luxurious.

01:03:31.785 --> 01:03:34.989
- It's the PresidentiaI suite.
- A comforting sense of humour.

01:03:35.206 --> 01:03:37.032
I'll be a couple of doors down.

01:03:37.249 --> 01:03:40.250
Tom, I don't know why
we're staying in this fleabag.

01:03:40.503 --> 01:03:42.744
People mind their own
business in fleabags.

01:03:43.005 --> 01:03:46.125
I'm going out. Dig up
whatever Velvet tapes you can find.

01:03:46.342 --> 01:03:47.172
Get receipts.

01:03:48.719 --> 01:03:49.881
Yes, sir.

01:03:51.095 --> 01:03:54.049
My husband had
five cash accounts he used.

01:03:54.265 --> 01:03:55.843
Between November...

01:03:56.101 --> 01:03:57.844
...of 1992...

01:03:58.478 --> 01:03:59.806
...and March...

01:04:00.063 --> 01:04:02.305
...of 1993...

01:04:02.565 --> 01:04:06.266
...he wrote one check out
to cash from each account.

01:04:07.612 --> 01:04:10.779
My husband never dealt
with money personally.

01:04:10.990 --> 01:04:12.533
Certainly not cash.

01:04:12.784 --> 01:04:15.571
These checks he wrote
are for very odd amounts.

01:04:15.787 --> 01:04:18.907
When totalled together,
the five checks...

01:04:19.165 --> 01:04:24.076
...from the five different accounts,
they equaI $1 million.

01:04:24.795 --> 01:04:26.918
That is interesting, Mrs. Christian.

01:04:27.131 --> 01:04:29.254
I only mentioned this because...

01:04:29.508 --> 01:04:32.425
...you asked me to look
for anything unusuaI.

01:04:32.720 --> 01:04:35.211
I've got about $5000 left in cash.

01:04:35.431 --> 01:04:39.096
I'll need another 50, if you approve
the plan I mentioned earlier.

01:04:39.351 --> 01:04:42.935
I'm very close to identifying
the man in the mask.

01:04:43.148 --> 01:04:45.354
I'll have Mr. Longdale arrange it.

01:04:45.567 --> 01:04:47.476
How will I get it to you?

01:04:47.694 --> 01:04:49.686
I'll give you the address.

01:04:49.988 --> 01:04:53.439
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

01:05:25.689 --> 01:05:29.141
Welcome to the world of Dino Velvet.

01:05:56.930 --> 01:05:59.800
Who is this?
In the mask, who is he?

01:06:00.809 --> 01:06:02.552
Come on, wake up.
Who is this?

01:06:02.811 --> 01:06:06.476
One of Dino's lunatics.
He's in a bunch of these.

01:06:06.690 --> 01:06:07.603
What's his name?

01:06:07.857 --> 01:06:10.609
I don't know.
That's his whole thing.

01:06:10.860 --> 01:06:12.852
He always wears a mask.

01:06:13.153 --> 01:06:15.989
He calls himself Machete-
No, Machine.

01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:19.027
He calls himself Machine.

01:06:20.661 --> 01:06:22.784
He's a lover, man.

01:06:23.038 --> 01:06:26.242
Definitely loves
what he does for a living.

01:06:27.167 --> 01:06:29.204
Can't say the same about you.

01:06:39.927 --> 01:06:41.505
Yes, yes.

01:06:43.055 --> 01:06:45.807
You can see they really
appreciate my style here.

01:06:46.058 --> 01:06:50.221
I'm not the kind to blend in
with the crowd, if you didn't notice.

01:06:50.478 --> 01:06:52.969
Like these ladies here,
they like my style.

01:06:58.445 --> 01:06:59.358
Who is it?

01:06:59.571 --> 01:07:01.362
This is Max California.

01:07:01.615 --> 01:07:04.486
I called earlier.
I'm a friend of Frenchie's, from L.A.

01:07:04.702 --> 01:07:07.620
My partner and I would like
to speak to Mr. Velvet.

01:07:07.872 --> 01:07:09.152
He's not here.

01:07:09.832 --> 01:07:11.955
We have to give him
a large sum of money.

01:07:12.210 --> 01:07:14.451
If he's not interested, we'll split.

01:07:32.355 --> 01:07:34.228
What are you talking about?

01:07:34.440 --> 01:07:38.023
Can't you just answer
my simple question?

01:07:39.529 --> 01:07:43.229
I asked you a question!
Where the fuck is Laura?!

01:07:43.616 --> 01:07:46.534
I've been asking you that
the last 10 minutes.

01:07:46.744 --> 01:07:49.152
Sit down.
Make yourself comfortable.

01:07:49.622 --> 01:07:50.701
You idiot!

01:07:50.957 --> 01:07:52.949
Going to shoot in two days?

01:07:53.209 --> 01:07:55.415
Man, you're spending my money.

01:07:55.670 --> 01:07:57.661
Yeah, you better do that.

01:07:58.213 --> 01:07:59.956
Fucking asshole!

01:08:00.215 --> 01:08:02.920
It's an honour to meet you.
Thank you for seeing us.

01:08:04.469 --> 01:08:05.632
God!

01:08:08.306 --> 01:08:10.050
So, what can I do you for?

01:08:10.308 --> 01:08:15.185
We'd like to commission a film.
A Dino Velvet originaI, one of a kind.

01:08:15.731 --> 01:08:17.060
That's right.

01:08:17.567 --> 01:08:19.773
I'm a huge admirer of yours.

01:08:19.986 --> 01:08:22.228
God, I love flattery.

01:08:22.779 --> 01:08:25.817
You're a genius, Mr. Velvet.
A goddamn genius.

01:08:26.033 --> 01:08:28.322
The only one still transferring
film to video.

01:08:28.578 --> 01:08:31.743
Nobody really appreciates
that kind of integrity anymore.

01:08:32.038 --> 01:08:35.242
The grain and the gritty look you get.

01:08:37.836 --> 01:08:39.116
Which is your favourite?

01:08:39.337 --> 01:08:42.788
If I had to choose, it'd either be
Choke or Devil.

01:08:43.591 --> 01:08:47.671
The subliminaI imagery in Choke
is what gets under your skin.

01:08:48.764 --> 01:08:52.926
Well, Devil frightened me
as much as it excited me...

01:08:53.185 --> 01:08:55.854
...but I'd be hard-pressed
to choose a favourite.

01:09:00.442 --> 01:09:03.313
What kind of a budget
are we talking about?

01:09:04.404 --> 01:09:08.615
Five thousand now.
Five thousand upon delivery.

01:09:08.823 --> 01:09:11.031
Two women. One white, one black.

01:09:11.493 --> 01:09:13.569
Hard bondage, of course.

01:09:13.996 --> 01:09:15.703
Other than that, trusting...

01:09:16.040 --> 01:09:17.913
...your artistic interpretation...

01:09:18.167 --> 01:09:20.622
...I only have two stipulations.

01:09:25.508 --> 01:09:26.968
Challenge me.

01:09:28.638 --> 01:09:30.465
I want to watch you work.

01:09:31.307 --> 01:09:34.094
You don't want a franchise, do you?

01:09:34.685 --> 01:09:37.520
SteaI the recipe for my secret...

01:09:37.772 --> 01:09:39.930
...hot sauce?

01:09:40.858 --> 01:09:42.103
No.

01:09:44.194 --> 01:09:45.309
That's good.

01:09:45.529 --> 01:09:47.568
I appreciate that.

01:09:52.868 --> 01:09:54.328
Second stipulation.

01:09:54.579 --> 01:09:56.287
The other performer...

01:09:56.999 --> 01:09:58.790
...has to be...

01:09:59.001 --> 01:10:00.792
...that animaI you use.

01:10:01.044 --> 01:10:02.704
The man in the mask.

01:10:04.214 --> 01:10:05.543
Machine.

01:10:12.764 --> 01:10:14.223
I don't know.

01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:16.927
He might be interested.

01:10:18.103 --> 01:10:21.305
But I think it'll cost you another...

01:10:23.858 --> 01:10:25.896
...five to seven grand.

01:10:26.276 --> 01:10:29.063
I can arrange something
really speciaI for ten.

01:10:29.529 --> 01:10:30.904
You can do that.

01:10:31.114 --> 01:10:32.608
Good enough for me.

01:10:34.284 --> 01:10:38.413
I'll just have to put
my thinking cap on.

01:10:42.210 --> 01:10:45.495
I'm going to keep this as a deposit.

01:10:45.755 --> 01:10:48.709
You make sure you call me
after 10 o'clock tonight.

01:10:49.008 --> 01:10:50.668
10 o'clock.

01:10:54.639 --> 01:10:59.015
You know, you have a very speciaI,
very beautifuI face.

01:10:59.267 --> 01:11:01.509
The way light hits it.

01:11:02.229 --> 01:11:04.055
I'd like to shoot you.

01:11:05.023 --> 01:11:06.054
You don't mind?

01:11:07.359 --> 01:11:08.734
I'm camera-shy.

01:11:09.152 --> 01:11:11.987
You trust me to take your money,
but not your picture?

01:11:12.197 --> 01:11:14.688
Those are two different
kinds of trust.

01:11:15.200 --> 01:11:17.323
I hope we can do business.

01:11:26.170 --> 01:11:29.539
Hoyt Avenue, Brooklyn, 3 o'clock.

01:11:32.175 --> 01:11:33.551
I'll be there.

01:11:36.638 --> 01:11:39.094
I got something to tend to. Thanks.

01:11:39.891 --> 01:11:42.217
So are we in the movie business?

01:11:43.228 --> 01:11:44.224
That's for you.

01:11:44.521 --> 01:11:45.600
- What is it?
- Money.

01:11:45.814 --> 01:11:47.438
People use it to purchase goods.

01:11:47.649 --> 01:11:50.223
That's awfully generous and everything-

01:11:50.445 --> 01:11:52.437
It's not mine.
Don't make a big deaI.

01:11:52.697 --> 01:11:56.611
There's a plane ticket for the flight
you can catch to L.A. tonight.

01:11:56.868 --> 01:11:58.825
This is as far as I want you to go.

01:11:59.036 --> 01:12:00.780
What are you talking about?

01:12:00.997 --> 01:12:02.539
We're a team.
We're partners.

01:12:02.832 --> 01:12:07.623
Max, I'm sure you realize
these people we're dealing with...

01:12:08.587 --> 01:12:10.129
...are extremely disturbed.

01:12:10.338 --> 01:12:13.423
That's why you need me.
I know disturbed. Look at me.

01:12:13.633 --> 01:12:16.587
You did a great job.
It's time for you to go home.

01:12:16.803 --> 01:12:18.712
But this is, like, our big case.

01:12:18.930 --> 01:12:21.967
Tom, I know what's going on, okay?

01:12:22.517 --> 01:12:23.680
Okay, what?

01:12:23.894 --> 01:12:26.764
Dino and Machine and Eddie
made a snuff film, right?

01:12:27.022 --> 01:12:30.605
I can't figure out why you're involved.
Maybe the victim-?

01:12:30.817 --> 01:12:32.193
First, who said you're right?

01:12:32.444 --> 01:12:34.982
Second, who said
anything about a victim?

01:12:35.197 --> 01:12:37.320
Only 3 rules in life, Tom Welles.

01:12:37.574 --> 01:12:40.777
One, there's always a victim.
And two, don't be it.

01:12:41.036 --> 01:12:41.865
And three?

01:12:42.078 --> 01:12:43.192
I forgot three.

01:12:43.412 --> 01:12:45.619
Good, I want you to forget everything.

01:12:45.831 --> 01:12:49.081
I want you to get on a plane to L.A.
and forget it all.

01:12:50.419 --> 01:12:54.998
I get calls for work on the West Coast.
I'd like to call you again.

01:12:55.216 --> 01:12:57.504
You're going to look me up
and call me?

01:12:57.760 --> 01:13:01.675
I could use your help. I meant it
when I said I think you're smart.

01:13:01.932 --> 01:13:04.055
I'm not patronizing you.

01:13:04.267 --> 01:13:05.643
Well, thanks.

01:13:05.936 --> 01:13:08.687
All right.
You take care, Max California.

01:13:15.028 --> 01:13:17.981
All right, Tom Welles.
DeviI's waiting on you.

01:14:40.737 --> 01:14:42.528
There you are.

01:14:42.822 --> 01:14:44.862
Come and join us.

01:14:56.545 --> 01:14:58.205
Hello, Machine.

01:14:59.256 --> 01:15:00.169
Love your work.

01:15:05.636 --> 01:15:08.305
Did you bring the money?

01:15:09.682 --> 01:15:11.010
It's right here.

01:15:11.267 --> 01:15:12.298
Good.

01:15:13.727 --> 01:15:15.138
Where are the women?

01:15:15.354 --> 01:15:16.848
Women...

01:15:17.940 --> 01:15:19.933
...they're always late.

01:15:26.701 --> 01:15:28.444
What are these for?

01:15:28.661 --> 01:15:30.819
They're just props.

01:15:31.080 --> 01:15:33.239
Nice, aren't they?

01:15:33.457 --> 01:15:37.538
Machine and I were just talking
about the beauty of knives.

01:15:40.922 --> 01:15:43.923
My guests have arrived!

01:15:46.094 --> 01:15:51.136
Mr. W., would you be so kind as
to remove any firearms from your person?

01:15:51.933 --> 01:15:52.929
What are you doing?

01:15:54.102 --> 01:15:56.854
I hate to repeat myself.
It makes me look so stupid.

01:15:57.522 --> 01:15:58.685
Slowly.

01:15:58.940 --> 01:16:01.182
Please, show me your gun.

01:16:02.277 --> 01:16:03.771
Nice and easy!

01:16:05.197 --> 01:16:07.355
That's right. Easy.

01:16:07.657 --> 01:16:09.282
Good.

01:16:09.618 --> 01:16:12.535
Now empty those bullets
onto the table.

01:16:12.746 --> 01:16:14.205
Very carefully.

01:16:14.414 --> 01:16:17.498
- I don't know why you think-
- Shut up, you fuck!

01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:22.247
I'll put an arrow right through
your goddamn throat, you understand?

01:16:28.344 --> 01:16:29.589
That's him.

01:16:30.679 --> 01:16:32.138
Last bullet.
The last one.

01:16:32.933 --> 01:16:34.012
Good boy.

01:16:34.267 --> 01:16:36.937
Now cuff him to the bed, Eddie.

01:16:37.312 --> 01:16:38.687
Yes, sir.

01:16:38.897 --> 01:16:40.225
Machine!

01:16:47.072 --> 01:16:49.989
I didn't know what
to make of you at first.

01:16:52.201 --> 01:16:56.329
And you certainly had Eddie here
on pins and needles.

01:16:57.957 --> 01:17:00.874
Lo and behold,
from right out of the blue came...

01:17:01.085 --> 01:17:05.498
...an old business acquaintance of ours
to explain everything.

01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:08.924
Satan ex machina.

01:17:10.052 --> 01:17:12.722
You remember Mr. Longdale, don't you?

01:17:15.683 --> 01:17:16.714
Get it over with.

01:17:16.934 --> 01:17:19.057
Shut up. Nobody's talking to you.

01:17:21.189 --> 01:17:24.274
What I could do with faces
like these on film.

01:17:25.110 --> 01:17:28.774
But on second thought,
why would I need their faces?

01:17:29.739 --> 01:17:31.233
You listen to me.

01:17:31.490 --> 01:17:33.033
You'll get that film.

01:17:33.284 --> 01:17:36.154
You'll bring it back here,
give it to me.

01:17:36.370 --> 01:17:40.748
Just so we make this
as efficient as possible...

01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.574
...there is an incentive.

01:17:54.556 --> 01:17:56.715
He's got nothing to do with this.

01:17:56.933 --> 01:17:58.725
He doesn't know anything.

01:17:58.936 --> 01:18:02.802
Can't you guess
what I'm about to say next?!

01:18:04.357 --> 01:18:06.812
If you don't bring me that film...

01:18:07.026 --> 01:18:09.351
...we're going to kill him,
fuck him...

01:18:09.779 --> 01:18:11.321
...and film it.

01:18:14.575 --> 01:18:17.031
If that's not enough for you...

01:18:17.286 --> 01:18:20.118
...we're going to go after
your family.

01:18:22.789 --> 01:18:24.331
I'll get the film.

01:18:26.709 --> 01:18:29.710
Good boy.
You're being very cooperative.

01:18:30.296 --> 01:18:33.131
Mr. Longdale here will
keep you company.

01:18:34.259 --> 01:18:35.207
Why me?

01:18:35.468 --> 01:18:37.875
Because I don't like you,
Mr. Longdale.

01:18:47.688 --> 01:18:49.182
Mr. W...

01:18:52.734 --> 01:18:54.015
...hurry back.

01:18:58.533 --> 01:19:02.862
Since I met you, there isn't much you've
done that I haven't been party to.

01:19:03.079 --> 01:19:06.080
None of this would be happening
if you'd given up.

01:19:06.332 --> 01:19:08.823
Or not taken the job
in the first place.

01:19:09.085 --> 01:19:11.457
I never expected you to get this far.

01:19:11.713 --> 01:19:15.792
I hired you because you're young
and completely out of your league.

01:19:16.008 --> 01:19:18.334
But I underestimated your ambition.

01:19:18.595 --> 01:19:23.553
You took one look at the Christian
compound. It was heady, wasn't it?

01:19:23.766 --> 01:19:27.811
You weren't peeking through the gates.
Mrs. Christian welcomed you in.

01:19:28.062 --> 01:19:31.514
Do you think people like
the Christians hire people like us...

01:19:31.774 --> 01:19:33.933
...as an invitation
to their dinner parties?

01:19:34.194 --> 01:19:38.523
No, we're there to clean up the mess,
to wipe their royaI asses.

01:19:38.740 --> 01:19:40.400
You were asked to buy a snuff film.

01:19:40.617 --> 01:19:43.820
They couldn't find one,
so you paid them to make one.

01:19:44.078 --> 01:19:46.071
Isn't that what happened?

01:19:46.289 --> 01:19:48.957
She was alive till you paid
to have her murdered?

01:19:49.166 --> 01:19:51.040
How much did Christian
pay for your conscience?

01:19:51.293 --> 01:19:52.123
A million?

01:19:52.920 --> 01:19:54.544
I've been well compensated.

01:19:54.755 --> 01:19:56.546
But you, I bought cheap.

01:19:58.175 --> 01:20:01.674
Just because Mrs. Christian
praised your discretion...

01:20:01.929 --> 01:20:05.214
...you sat on evidence of murder,
dragged your friend, family...

01:20:05.475 --> 01:20:07.883
...into some old graveyard...

01:20:08.144 --> 01:20:12.094
...to dig up a dead girI with no name
that nobody remembers.

01:20:12.357 --> 01:20:13.637
Mary Anne Mathews.

01:20:13.858 --> 01:20:16.859
That was her name.
Her mother remembers her.

01:20:17.112 --> 01:20:18.440
I'm bored with this.

01:20:18.863 --> 01:20:21.105
You know the difference between us?

01:20:21.324 --> 01:20:24.490
I will survive this and profit by it,
whereas you...

01:20:24.743 --> 01:20:25.858
...you will not.

01:20:26.120 --> 01:20:27.697
Now get the film.

01:20:33.293 --> 01:20:34.953
Did you watch it with him?

01:20:35.170 --> 01:20:36.036
What?

01:20:36.255 --> 01:20:38.413
The snuff film.
Did you watch it with him?

01:20:38.632 --> 01:20:40.921
This isn't helping your friend.
Get the film.

01:20:41.176 --> 01:20:42.291
Did it get him off?

01:20:42.761 --> 01:20:44.172
Mr. Christian?

01:20:44.430 --> 01:20:47.680
Watching them cut her up like that?
Did he jerk off to it?

01:20:47.891 --> 01:20:50.133
Did you hold his cock?
Give him the hand job...

01:20:50.394 --> 01:20:53.181
...while Mary Anne Mathews was dying?!

01:20:53.439 --> 01:20:56.143
- What are you doing?
- Trying to understand!

01:20:56.358 --> 01:20:58.600
What did he want
with a snuff film?!

01:20:59.027 --> 01:20:59.940
Why?

01:21:00.153 --> 01:21:02.145
Yes, why? Why?!

01:21:02.405 --> 01:21:04.314
Why did he want a film...

01:21:04.574 --> 01:21:07.029
...of a little girI being butchered?!

01:21:08.411 --> 01:21:09.739
Because he could.

01:21:10.371 --> 01:21:12.280
He did it because he could.

01:21:14.334 --> 01:21:16.542
What reason were you looking for?

01:21:20.633 --> 01:21:21.878
Now.

01:21:36.231 --> 01:21:37.476
Here.

01:21:38.233 --> 01:21:39.644
Shoot me.

01:21:48.619 --> 01:21:51.026
Mr. Welles, the film, please.

01:21:52.164 --> 01:21:53.362
Let him go first.

01:21:53.624 --> 01:21:56.031
Do whatever you want to me,
but let him go.

01:21:56.251 --> 01:21:58.789
Very well.
Set him free, Machine.

01:22:35.331 --> 01:22:37.240
- Is that it?
- That's it.

01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:38.698
Bravo.

01:22:40.169 --> 01:22:41.961
You don't want to miss this...

01:22:42.297 --> 01:22:43.957
...Mr. Welles.

01:22:53.181 --> 01:22:55.091
So it ends.

01:22:57.144 --> 01:22:59.765
As if she never existed.

01:23:00.272 --> 01:23:03.771
Don't blame yourself.
You were in way over your head.

01:23:04.359 --> 01:23:06.317
You motherfuckers!

01:23:08.488 --> 01:23:11.026
You smalltime motherfuckers.

01:23:12.784 --> 01:23:14.611
I want to know something.

01:23:15.038 --> 01:23:19.035
Why you're still smalltime with a
million dollars to spread around?

01:23:19.626 --> 01:23:20.456
Million?

01:23:20.668 --> 01:23:23.585
Yeah! That's what Christian
gave Longdale!

01:23:24.421 --> 01:23:26.165
That's what he gave you, right?

01:23:26.381 --> 01:23:27.710
A million in cash?

01:23:28.133 --> 01:23:30.292
You stupid fucking trash!

01:23:30.511 --> 01:23:34.460
What the hell-?
Is he talking dollars here?

01:23:34.807 --> 01:23:36.217
No, he's Iying.

01:23:36.558 --> 01:23:37.969
Did you fuck me?

01:23:39.354 --> 01:23:40.468
Did you fuck me on this?

01:23:40.688 --> 01:23:41.851
Of course not, Edward!

01:23:42.065 --> 01:23:44.104
Then what's he talking about?

01:23:44.317 --> 01:23:47.318
He's saying that Longdale fucked us...

01:23:47.570 --> 01:23:50.571
...which is so totally,
completely bizarre.

01:23:51.199 --> 01:23:52.064
Stay back.

01:23:52.784 --> 01:23:53.780
Stay away from me.

01:23:54.661 --> 01:23:55.941
Put the bow down!

01:23:56.162 --> 01:23:58.154
I told you not to trust the prick.

01:23:58.372 --> 01:24:01.041
Mr. Longdale, if there's no honour...

01:24:01.250 --> 01:24:03.041
...among perverts and pornographers...

01:24:03.252 --> 01:24:05.375
...the whole business would fall apart.

01:24:05.587 --> 01:24:09.371
Because there's no records,
no contracts, no legaI recourse.

01:24:09.633 --> 01:24:11.127
So if someone...

01:24:11.385 --> 01:24:12.665
...cheats us...

01:24:12.886 --> 01:24:14.511
...that person can't be trusted.

01:24:14.972 --> 01:24:17.807
That person could turn us in,
have us killed.

01:24:18.559 --> 01:24:22.343
So we don't have a choice,
do we, Mr. Longdale?

01:24:22.563 --> 01:24:25.682
I want this to be over.
Nobody else needs to get hurt.

01:24:25.899 --> 01:24:27.358
Eddie, take your gun out.

01:24:27.860 --> 01:24:28.809
Fuck you.

01:24:29.027 --> 01:24:31.234
Take it out now! And drop it.

01:24:31.447 --> 01:24:33.070
Or I will shoot.

01:24:33.489 --> 01:24:35.316
Don't be stupid, Edward.

01:24:40.788 --> 01:24:42.330
Kick it in my direction.

01:24:46.044 --> 01:24:48.617
Now, Dino, drop the crossbow.

01:24:53.260 --> 01:24:54.635
Action.

01:25:06.273 --> 01:25:08.016
This is wrong.

01:25:08.649 --> 01:25:10.559
Something's wrong.

01:25:10.777 --> 01:25:12.235
God, not like this.

01:25:14.239 --> 01:25:16.565
I am supposed to have...

01:25:17.326 --> 01:25:19.117
...something more cinematic.

01:25:19.828 --> 01:25:21.620
Kill them, Machine.

01:25:22.915 --> 01:25:24.492
Kill them all.

01:25:32.091 --> 01:25:33.253
Machine!

01:26:14.549 --> 01:26:15.379
Stop, Eddie!

01:26:17.051 --> 01:26:19.837
I swear to Christ,
I'll shoot you in the back!

01:26:21.555 --> 01:26:22.669
Take off the mask.

01:26:24.808 --> 01:26:26.433
Take off the fucking mask!

01:26:26.768 --> 01:26:28.726
He's only got one bullet!

01:28:10.955 --> 01:28:12.449
Amy, listen carefully.

01:28:12.665 --> 01:28:14.990
- Tom, where are you?
- Amy, just listen.

01:28:15.209 --> 01:28:17.581
Take Cindy.
Get out of the house now.

01:28:17.837 --> 01:28:20.079
Go to where we spent
Fourth of July weekend.

01:28:20.298 --> 01:28:23.216
- Why? What's wrong?
- Amy, please. I can't.

01:28:23.469 --> 01:28:25.461
I'll be there in three hours.

01:28:25.971 --> 01:28:27.679
I'm on my way! Go now!

01:28:28.140 --> 01:28:30.014
Tom, you're scaring me.

01:28:30.225 --> 01:28:31.969
Please, Amy, just do it!

01:28:32.978 --> 01:28:35.101
Okay, bye. I'm going.

01:28:42.862 --> 01:28:44.819
Mrs. Christian, it's Tom Welles.

01:28:45.031 --> 01:28:46.359
Longdale is dead.

01:28:46.574 --> 01:28:48.483
He was killed by the men
who made the film.

01:28:48.701 --> 01:28:51.904
He hired them for your husband.
Kept most of the million.

01:28:52.163 --> 01:28:53.871
The film is real!

01:28:54.082 --> 01:28:55.362
They killed that girI!

01:28:57.460 --> 01:28:58.788
Mrs. Christian?

01:28:59.003 --> 01:29:01.755
I'm still here, Mr. Welles.

01:29:01.964 --> 01:29:03.459
I'm sorry.
I know this must be-

01:29:03.716 --> 01:29:05.045
Are you in danger?

01:29:05.259 --> 01:29:08.177
We'll go to the police.
I'll tell you everything tonight.

01:29:08.388 --> 01:29:10.097
We'll call the police
in the morning.

01:29:10.474 --> 01:29:11.470
All right.

01:29:11.934 --> 01:29:12.930
Eight o'clock?

01:29:13.143 --> 01:29:14.970
Yes, eight o'clock is fine.

01:29:15.187 --> 01:29:16.431
Do you know...

01:29:16.688 --> 01:29:20.732
...what the poor girI's name was?

01:29:23.027 --> 01:29:24.984
Mary Anne Mathews.

01:29:28.741 --> 01:29:29.737
Thank you.

01:29:30.076 --> 01:29:32.152
Mr. Welles, goodbye.

01:30:29.965 --> 01:30:31.757
Are you okay?

01:30:33.719 --> 01:30:34.917
Are you?

01:30:35.888 --> 01:30:38.213
Why haven't you called me?

01:30:40.935 --> 01:30:44.220
Why did you disappear
off the face of the Earth?

01:30:45.398 --> 01:30:46.976
You're bleeding.

01:30:47.567 --> 01:30:49.145
Are those handcuffs?

01:30:49.402 --> 01:30:51.229
Were you locked up?

01:30:52.155 --> 01:30:54.860
Kept from a phone? What happened?

01:30:55.075 --> 01:30:55.940
Start talking, Tom.

01:30:56.201 --> 01:31:00.448
Because if you want to stay married,
you can't treat me this way!

01:31:01.164 --> 01:31:02.408
You're right.

01:31:02.665 --> 01:31:04.622
Everything you say is right.

01:31:06.919 --> 01:31:09.411
That won't do it.
That's not enough, Tom.

01:31:09.673 --> 01:31:10.835
Not anymore.

01:31:12.008 --> 01:31:14.546
I'm not going to let
anything happen to us.

01:31:14.803 --> 01:31:16.961
Look where we are!

01:31:17.472 --> 01:31:20.141
Look at yourself!
Look at yourself! Look!

01:31:21.142 --> 01:31:22.553
You son of a bitch.

01:31:22.811 --> 01:31:26.559
You don't even have any idea
what you're putting me through.

01:31:28.483 --> 01:31:31.733
What was I supposed to think
happened to you?

01:31:37.284 --> 01:31:39.571
We're going to stay here a few days.

01:31:39.827 --> 01:31:41.202
It's just a few days.

01:31:41.454 --> 01:31:42.734
I'm sorry.

01:31:42.997 --> 01:31:44.906
There's no other way around this.

01:31:45.124 --> 01:31:46.701
I swear, I swear...

01:31:49.003 --> 01:31:52.087
...I won't let anything happen to us.
I'll take care of this.

01:31:52.339 --> 01:31:53.964
I swear it.

01:31:54.884 --> 01:31:56.509
I swear it.

01:31:58.388 --> 01:32:00.511
Now I have to go back out.

01:32:01.308 --> 01:32:02.506
Where?

01:32:05.854 --> 01:32:08.060
I have to see Mrs. Christian.

01:32:08.982 --> 01:32:10.891
She's the only witness.

01:32:12.068 --> 01:32:13.267
To what?

01:32:15.654 --> 01:32:17.564
We're going to be okay.

01:32:20.534 --> 01:32:22.326
We're going to be okay.

01:32:36.509 --> 01:32:38.750
Tom Welles.
Mrs. Christian's expecting me.

01:32:39.011 --> 01:32:40.838
Yes, she left instructions.

01:32:41.722 --> 01:32:44.130
I have to see her now.
It's extremely urgent.

01:32:44.892 --> 01:32:48.724
Mrs. Christian chose to take
her own life this afternoon, Mr. Welles.

01:32:54.109 --> 01:32:55.389
But I just...

01:32:56.069 --> 01:32:57.693
No, no, I just...

01:32:59.155 --> 01:33:00.650
I just spoke to her.

01:33:00.907 --> 01:33:04.110
Her instructions were
that this first envelope...

01:33:04.953 --> 01:33:06.364
...is for Mary's family.

01:33:06.790 --> 01:33:09.577
She wrote that you'd understand
what that meant.

01:33:10.252 --> 01:33:12.494
And the second envelope is for you.

01:33:14.673 --> 01:33:19.169
Services will be held next week,
if you'd like to attend.

01:33:20.262 --> 01:33:21.886
I am sorry, sir.

01:33:22.597 --> 01:33:23.760
Good night, sir.

01:33:59.508 --> 01:34:01.085
What are you doing?

01:34:03.678 --> 01:34:05.422
I have to go back.

01:34:16.774 --> 01:34:18.483
Whatever it is...

01:34:18.860 --> 01:34:20.520
...wherever you were...

01:34:20.737 --> 01:34:23.062
...just forget about it.

01:34:23.281 --> 01:34:24.989
You stay here.

01:34:25.492 --> 01:34:27.034
I can't.

01:34:30.163 --> 01:34:33.283
And risk us?
Risk your family? Why?

01:34:34.751 --> 01:34:37.371
There's no one left
to finish this but me.

01:34:38.337 --> 01:34:40.495
I'll call you
when it's safe to go home.

01:34:43.217 --> 01:34:45.708
We may not be there
when you get back.

01:35:00.150 --> 01:35:03.354
Cindy's education, and a lot more.

01:35:13.122 --> 01:35:14.699
I love you.

01:36:06.592 --> 01:36:08.750
Put your hands on your head.
Down on your knees.

01:36:10.888 --> 01:36:12.881
You think I'm fucking around?

01:36:15.976 --> 01:36:17.056
Hurts, doesn't it?

01:36:17.269 --> 01:36:18.680
What the fuck do you want?

01:36:18.896 --> 01:36:20.059
Who's Machine?

01:36:20.272 --> 01:36:21.387
Where does he live?

01:36:22.232 --> 01:36:23.394
I don't know.

01:36:23.650 --> 01:36:25.061
I want his name.

01:36:25.402 --> 01:36:27.643
I don't know his fucking name.

01:36:30.615 --> 01:36:32.857
I will never get tired of hurting you.

01:36:33.076 --> 01:36:37.204
I don't know his name. He shows up
in his mask, he leaves in his mask.

01:36:37.455 --> 01:36:39.247
He's from New York somewhere.

01:36:44.839 --> 01:36:46.463
Get in the car.

01:36:48.092 --> 01:36:48.922
Why?

01:36:49.677 --> 01:36:51.966
You're going to show me
where he killed her.

01:36:52.888 --> 01:36:54.003
Fuck you!

01:36:56.267 --> 01:36:58.175
All right, you fuck.

01:37:12.324 --> 01:37:14.816
What did you do before
you brought her here?

01:37:15.745 --> 01:37:18.200
Tell her how beautifuI she was...

01:37:19.457 --> 01:37:21.698
...how you'd make her a big star?

01:37:27.006 --> 01:37:28.500
Talk her up?

01:37:32.803 --> 01:37:35.044
What the fuck do you want from me?

01:37:39.059 --> 01:37:40.683
I want to know.

01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:45.474
You want to know?

01:37:49.319 --> 01:37:52.404
She was nothing.
A little pussy off the street.

01:37:52.615 --> 01:37:55.699
GirI like that disappears,
nobody gives a shit.

01:37:56.869 --> 01:37:59.158
Yeah, I talked her up.

01:37:59.455 --> 01:38:02.788
Told her what she wanted to hear,
that she'd be a star...

01:38:02.999 --> 01:38:06.285
...she'd make a lot of money,
and all the rest of the bullshit.

01:38:06.503 --> 01:38:10.713
When I was finished, she was all
excited about her big screen test.

01:38:12.424 --> 01:38:14.084
I called up Dino...

01:38:14.343 --> 01:38:17.593
...he and Machine flew out here.
We had a little party.

01:38:19.223 --> 01:38:21.132
What else you want to know?

01:38:21.850 --> 01:38:23.642
You saw the film, right?

01:38:24.436 --> 01:38:25.895
You know the ending.

01:38:28.107 --> 01:38:30.514
Nobody else saw you bring her in?

01:38:32.695 --> 01:38:35.731
Who's going to see?
Place is a fucking shithole.

01:38:39.326 --> 01:38:41.235
I brought her in and she...

01:38:43.038 --> 01:38:45.528
...saw Machine
standing in the corner.

01:38:46.958 --> 01:38:48.666
She started crying...

01:38:50.628 --> 01:38:52.835
...making these little noises.

01:38:54.924 --> 01:38:57.842
So I slapped her around a bit
just to shut her up.

01:38:58.136 --> 01:38:59.298
Dino...

01:38:59.554 --> 01:39:01.546
...fed her a bunch of pills.

01:39:03.101 --> 01:39:05.770
Machine put down the plastic over here.

01:39:08.982 --> 01:39:10.975
Just started cutting her up.

01:39:14.821 --> 01:39:17.193
That's it. She's dead.

01:39:17.407 --> 01:39:20.609
She's been dead a long time.
Nobody gives a shit but you.

01:39:35.257 --> 01:39:36.965
You wanted to know.

01:39:37.343 --> 01:39:38.967
Now you know.

01:39:41.013 --> 01:39:42.424
You were in here.

01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:46.305
You watched Mary Anne
bleed to death from here.

01:39:47.770 --> 01:39:48.884
Why?

01:39:50.689 --> 01:39:52.481
Why did you watch?

01:39:53.359 --> 01:39:54.770
I felt like it.

01:39:56.903 --> 01:39:58.694
I never saw nobody get done.

01:39:59.864 --> 01:40:00.778
Why?

01:40:02.117 --> 01:40:04.323
Did you get hard? Did you come?

01:40:04.536 --> 01:40:07.074
No. It made me sick.

01:40:07.330 --> 01:40:08.955
But what do I give a shit...

01:40:09.165 --> 01:40:13.246
...if some rich fucking wacko wants
to beat off to something like that?

01:40:13.504 --> 01:40:14.832
Stay down!

01:40:17.341 --> 01:40:19.381
It was something I did for money.

01:40:21.887 --> 01:40:23.963
I needed the fucking money.

01:40:24.640 --> 01:40:26.134
Where is she?

01:40:26.350 --> 01:40:27.809
Where did you put her body?

01:40:28.310 --> 01:40:30.220
I buried it in the woods.

01:40:31.479 --> 01:40:32.393
You won't find it.

01:40:32.605 --> 01:40:34.847
And even if you do,
what do you got?

01:40:35.066 --> 01:40:37.308
You got a girI's skeleton, that's it.

01:40:37.569 --> 01:40:39.645
Without the film, you got nothing.

01:40:40.530 --> 01:40:42.487
All you can do is cut me loose.

01:40:42.699 --> 01:40:45.106
Without the film,
you got nothing-

01:40:45.326 --> 01:40:46.951
What the fuck are you doing?

01:40:47.162 --> 01:40:49.071
- Hands behind your back.
- Fuck you!

01:40:49.914 --> 01:40:52.405
Put your hands behind your back!

01:40:52.625 --> 01:40:54.084
All right.

01:40:59.299 --> 01:41:01.423
What the fuck are you doing?

01:41:07.223 --> 01:41:09.133
I'm going to kill you.

01:41:10.560 --> 01:41:12.469
I'm going to kill you.

01:41:14.189 --> 01:41:17.558
And I'm going to leave you here
just like you left her.

01:41:19.527 --> 01:41:21.319
You're not going to kill me.

01:41:22.030 --> 01:41:23.193
You don't have it in you.

01:41:24.909 --> 01:41:27.447
You going to shoot me
with your own gun?

01:41:27.662 --> 01:41:28.990
Registered in your name?

01:41:31.415 --> 01:41:33.989
You thought this through,
didn't you, genius?

01:41:34.335 --> 01:41:36.660
You'll have to dig
the bullets out of my head.

01:41:36.921 --> 01:41:38.629
That'll be nice.

01:41:40.633 --> 01:41:42.375
Or you could dig a hole.

01:41:43.218 --> 01:41:46.669
Dig it with your own hands and
bury me next to your girlfriend.

01:41:47.305 --> 01:41:48.550
Go ahead.

01:41:49.224 --> 01:41:50.303
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:41:50.892 --> 01:41:51.758
Go ahead.

01:41:51.977 --> 01:41:54.135
What are you waiting for?
Go ahead, do it.

01:41:54.354 --> 01:41:55.813
You faggot!

01:41:57.983 --> 01:41:59.972
What do you want me to do?
Start crying?

01:42:00.190 --> 01:42:02.681
Like a baby?
" I'm so sorry I killed the girI."

01:42:02.901 --> 01:42:04.693
Fuck you! And fuck her!

01:42:04.903 --> 01:42:08.771
Go ahead, put me out of my misery.
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:42:09.950 --> 01:42:11.492
Pull the fucking trigger.

01:42:12.035 --> 01:42:13.067
Do it!

01:42:13.829 --> 01:42:14.908
Do it!

01:42:22.253 --> 01:42:23.996
You can't do it.

01:42:24.922 --> 01:42:26.915
You little pansy bitch!

01:42:27.133 --> 01:42:28.295
Look at you.

01:42:28.551 --> 01:42:30.508
Big fucking hero man.

01:42:30.720 --> 01:42:32.262
You can't fucking do it.

01:42:34.181 --> 01:42:35.593
Look at him.

01:42:36.393 --> 01:42:38.053
Big fucking hero.

01:42:39.104 --> 01:42:41.180
Go on home to your wifey!

01:42:42.316 --> 01:42:44.024
You pussy!

01:42:44.735 --> 01:42:46.644
You big fucking pussy!

01:42:48.530 --> 01:42:50.986
What are you going to do now, faggot?

01:42:53.367 --> 01:42:55.526
You can't go to the cops!

01:42:56.871 --> 01:43:01.415
Send me your wife and daughter.
We'll make a film, you faggot!

01:43:04.796 --> 01:43:05.995
Shit!

01:43:06.465 --> 01:43:08.089
You punk-ass!

01:43:55.055 --> 01:43:56.846
Mrs. Mathews?

01:43:57.141 --> 01:43:58.932
It's Thomas.

01:43:59.226 --> 01:44:00.886
Thomas Hart.

01:44:01.145 --> 01:44:04.643
I was there a few weeks ago
asking about your daughter.

01:44:05.064 --> 01:44:07.353
Yeah, you found her diary.

01:44:07.608 --> 01:44:09.103
Thank you.

01:44:09.777 --> 01:44:11.984
She did leave a note...

01:44:12.363 --> 01:44:16.657
...and her stupid boyfriend
dumped her in California...

01:44:16.951 --> 01:44:18.362
...so I told the FBI.

01:44:19.495 --> 01:44:21.073
Remember when...

01:44:21.789 --> 01:44:24.624
...I asked you if you'd want to know...

01:44:25.752 --> 01:44:26.997
...the truth...

01:44:27.962 --> 01:44:29.622
...no matter what?

01:44:30.423 --> 01:44:34.290
Some men, they took her and
they killed her and they buried her.

01:44:35.553 --> 01:44:37.178
I'm sorry.

01:44:37.430 --> 01:44:38.343
I'm sorry.

01:44:39.015 --> 01:44:41.090
I want to punish them for what they did.

01:44:41.558 --> 01:44:43.598
Why are you saying this?

01:44:43.810 --> 01:44:45.803
I can hurt them.

01:44:46.021 --> 01:44:49.306
Give me your permission
to hurt them, please.

01:44:50.442 --> 01:44:52.316
Tell me how much she meant to you.

01:44:53.445 --> 01:44:55.687
Just tell me that you loved her.

01:44:55.906 --> 01:44:58.944
- Please tell me that you loved her.
- I love her.

01:44:59.286 --> 01:45:01.243
I love her so much.

01:45:03.707 --> 01:45:05.949
I love her so much.

01:45:13.008 --> 01:45:14.337
Who's that?

01:45:19.514 --> 01:45:21.839
Die, you motherfucker, die!

01:46:57.528 --> 01:46:58.523
New York Hospital.

01:46:58.737 --> 01:47:00.646
Connect me to the duty nurse.

01:47:00.864 --> 01:47:01.812
Emergency.

01:47:02.073 --> 01:47:04.445
It's Lt. Anderson of the 13th precinct.

01:47:04.700 --> 01:47:07.785
Have you admitted an adult male
with an abdominal wound...

01:47:07.995 --> 01:47:10.569
...in the last 48 hours?
A stabbing incident.

01:47:10.832 --> 01:47:12.290
Abdominal wound?

01:47:12.542 --> 01:47:13.573
No, not one.

01:47:13.835 --> 01:47:14.997
Thank you.

01:47:15.211 --> 01:47:18.829
I'm looking for a stabbing victim.
Male. Maybe six feet.

01:47:19.049 --> 01:47:21.125
Filed a bogus report.

01:47:21.677 --> 01:47:24.250
We had a guy in on Monday, I think.

01:47:24.471 --> 01:47:26.796
It would've been
yesterday or the day before.

01:47:27.015 --> 01:47:27.845
Sorry.

01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:31.387
- Queens County Emergency.
- Hi, Lt. Anderson.

01:47:31.603 --> 01:47:33.347
We had a stabbing incident...

01:47:33.564 --> 01:47:35.936
...and supposed victim gave us
a false name.

01:47:36.150 --> 01:47:38.022
A male with an abdominal wound.

01:47:38.234 --> 01:47:40.273
Hold on. Let me check my records.

01:47:40.528 --> 01:47:43.280
There was a patient treated yesterday.

01:47:43.489 --> 01:47:45.482
Star tattoo on his right hand?

01:47:45.700 --> 01:47:47.360
Yes. George Anthony Higgins.

01:47:47.618 --> 01:47:51.996
Insurance policy is under his
mother's name, Doris Veronica Higgins.

01:47:52.248 --> 01:47:54.537
That's him.
Can you give me an address?

01:47:54.750 --> 01:47:58.084
It's under her address. Douglaston.
Need a street?

01:48:34.165 --> 01:48:37.581
I really wish you'd go
to church with me tonight.

01:48:42.590 --> 01:48:44.417
I love you, son.

01:48:48.428 --> 01:48:50.919
I'll be home by 10. Bye-bye.

01:53:44.056 --> 01:53:46.132
You know the best part
of killing someone?

01:53:46.725 --> 01:53:48.764
The look on their face.

01:53:49.019 --> 01:53:50.427
It's that look...

01:53:50.643 --> 01:53:52.303
...not when they're threatened...

01:53:52.519 --> 01:53:54.179
...not when you hurt them...

01:53:54.396 --> 01:53:57.066
...not even when they see the knife.

01:53:57.483 --> 01:53:59.606
It's when they feeI the knife go in.

01:53:59.818 --> 01:54:00.898
That's it.

01:54:01.445 --> 01:54:03.153
It's surprise.

01:54:03.364 --> 01:54:05.403
They can't believe
it's really happening.

01:54:05.699 --> 01:54:06.814
She had that look.

01:54:07.408 --> 01:54:10.694
The girI, when she knew
it wasn't just porno.

01:54:10.912 --> 01:54:12.951
You feeI how hard I am?

01:54:23.800 --> 01:54:25.295
Take off the mask.

01:54:41.485 --> 01:54:43.726
What did you expect, a monster?

01:54:51.871 --> 01:54:53.744
My name's George.

01:54:53.998 --> 01:54:55.907
You probably knew that already.

01:54:58.460 --> 01:55:00.702
Can't get your mind around it, huh?

01:55:00.921 --> 01:55:02.463
I don't have any answers.

01:55:02.673 --> 01:55:05.793
Nothing I can say will
make you sleep easier at night.

01:55:06.010 --> 01:55:08.927
I wasn't beaten. I wasn't molested.

01:55:09.138 --> 01:55:11.047
Mommy didn't abuse me.

01:55:12.892 --> 01:55:14.469
Daddy never raped me.

01:55:15.269 --> 01:55:17.262
I'm only what I am.

01:55:17.479 --> 01:55:19.270
That's all there is to it!

01:55:31.743 --> 01:55:33.320
There's no mystery.

01:55:33.536 --> 01:55:37.072
Things I do, I do them because
I like them.

01:55:38.501 --> 01:55:40.209
Because I want to.

01:56:28.216 --> 01:56:30.457
You've been stabbed?
How many times?

01:56:30.676 --> 01:56:33.083
Sir, can you tell me your name?

01:57:24.439 --> 01:57:25.719
Is that you?

01:57:29.444 --> 01:57:30.607
My God!

01:57:48.419 --> 01:57:49.961
Save me.

01:57:55.093 --> 01:57:56.801
Save me.

01:59:12.880 --> 01:59:14.339
Dear Mr. Welles.:

01:59:14.590 --> 01:59:16.049
Thank you for writing...

01:59:16.258 --> 01:59:18.298
...and telling me your real name...

01:59:18.552 --> 01:59:21.589
...who you really are
and what really happened.

01:59:21.847 --> 01:59:24.172
I'm glad those men are dead.

01:59:24.475 --> 01:59:27.475
But nothing will ever
fill the hole in my heart.

01:59:27.727 --> 01:59:30.728
I will try to use the money
you sent for some good...

01:59:30.939 --> 01:59:33.311
...after I get some help for myself.

01:59:33.566 --> 01:59:35.974
I hated you
for telling me the truth...

01:59:36.194 --> 01:59:39.563
...but now I realize you and I
are the only people...

01:59:39.823 --> 01:59:42.444
...that ever really
cared about Mary Anne.

01:59:42.700 --> 01:59:44.325
Yours truly...

01:59:44.619 --> 01:59:46.030
...Janet Mathews.
