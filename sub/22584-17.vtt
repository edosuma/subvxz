00:03.880 --> 00:07.190
Captain's Starlog, December 27, 2154.

00:07.760 --> 00:10.069
We're on course
for the Berengarius system...

00:10.200 --> 00:13.510
a potential site for the first in a series
of proposed starbases.

00:13.640 --> 00:17.394
A Vulcan science vessel surveyed
the seventh planet over 50 years ago.

00:18.040 --> 00:21.635
The file states it's an M-Class world
with a flourishing ecosystem.

00:21.760 --> 00:24.035
-No intelligent life.
-Sounds promising.

00:24.160 --> 00:26.958
They did report one distinctive feature
which bears mentioning.

00:27.080 --> 00:28.069
And that is?

00:28.200 --> 00:32.512
A species of flying reptile,
some reportedly over 200 metres long.

00:33.080 --> 00:35.389
They're also said to breathe fire.

00:36.760 --> 00:40.639
There's been lingering questions
over the accuracy of this report.

00:41.880 --> 00:43.632
Can't wait to find out.

00:44.840 --> 00:46.239
There's a ship.

00:47.240 --> 00:50.676
-It's on an intercept course.
-I don't recognise the configuration.

00:50.800 --> 00:52.119
Let's see it.

00:56.160 --> 00:58.628
-Doesn't look very friendly.
-Tactical Alert.

01:00.160 --> 01:03.391
-Let's see what they want, Hoshi.
-They're responding.

01:04.920 --> 01:07.275
-Captain Archer.
-And you are?

01:07.720 --> 01:08.994
Harrad-Sar.

01:10.280 --> 01:13.113
Deactivate your weapon systems
immediately...

01:13.480 --> 01:15.675
or I'll be forced to open fire.

01:18.760 --> 01:21.069
It's been a long road

01:22.280 --> 01:23.838
Gettin' from there to here

01:25.360 --> 01:27.271
It's been a long time

01:28.960 --> 01:32.396
But my time is finally near

01:32.840 --> 01:36.276
And I will see my dream
Come alive at last

01:36.800 --> 01:39.758
I will touch the sky

01:40.040 --> 01:43.555
And they're not gonna
Hold me down no more

01:43.920 --> 01:46.878
No, they're not gonna change my mind

01:47.000 --> 01:51.039
'Cause I've got faith of the heart

01:51.680 --> 01:54.433
I'm going where my heart will take me

01:54.560 --> 01:57.950
I've got faith to believe

01:59.080 --> 02:01.799
I can do anything

02:01.920 --> 02:05.469
I've got strength of the soul

02:06.280 --> 02:09.192
And no one's gonna bend or break me

02:09.320 --> 02:13.108
I can reach any star

02:14.720 --> 02:17.792
I've got faith

02:18.480 --> 02:21.119
I've got faith

02:22.120 --> 02:25.669
Faith of the heart

02:27.000 --> 02:33.074

02:34.520 --> 02:37.990
-You're still targeting my ship.
-And you're targeting mine.

02:38.680 --> 02:42.150
-lt seems we're at an impasse.
-Not for long.

02:42.680 --> 02:45.194
Instead of sitting here pointing guns
at each other...

02:45.320 --> 02:48.551
why don't we deactivate
our weapons together?

02:51.240 --> 02:52.468
Very well.

02:59.480 --> 03:01.755
Now, what can we do for you?

03:02.080 --> 03:04.878
-I have a proposal to make.
-I'm listening.

03:05.080 --> 03:07.594
I prefer to discuss business in person.

03:08.600 --> 03:10.670
You're invited aboard my ship.

03:11.360 --> 03:12.873
We've dealt with your people before.

03:13.000 --> 03:15.753
The experience wasn't one
I care to repeat.

03:16.280 --> 03:19.272
If you can give me some idea
what this is about....

03:19.400 --> 03:21.231
What I have to say
could smooth the relations...

03:21.360 --> 03:24.272
between your Starfleet
and the Orion Syndicate.

03:24.920 --> 03:28.799
My hospitality is renowned, Captain.
I don't offer it to everyone.

03:29.080 --> 03:32.868
And once I have been refused,
I never offer it again.

03:38.040 --> 03:40.235
The last Orions we ran into
almost turned...

03:40.360 --> 03:42.476
nine of our crew members into slaves.

03:42.960 --> 03:46.748
-Let's at least ask him to come here.
-I have a feeling he'd see it as an insult.

03:46.880 --> 03:48.074
I can live with that.

03:48.200 --> 03:50.953
Any chance to improve relations
with the Syndicate...

03:51.080 --> 03:52.991
I'm willing to take that risk.

03:53.560 --> 03:56.313
Anything to have one
less hostile species out there.

04:02.400 --> 04:04.630
Seven of the transfer conduits
are back online.

04:04.760 --> 04:06.398
The eighth is still giving us
some trouble.

04:06.520 --> 04:09.637
-Did you run a phase diagnostic?
-lt came back negative.

04:09.760 --> 04:12.479
-Better work up a bypass.
-Already underway.

04:14.640 --> 04:15.709
Kelby.

04:17.200 --> 04:18.269
Kelby.

04:19.839 --> 04:23.037
-We have a problem?
-I'm not sure what you mean, sir.

04:24.120 --> 04:26.634
Look, the Captain asked me
to stick around.

04:26.760 --> 04:29.593
As soon as the repairs are done,
I'm back on Columbia.

04:29.720 --> 04:33.030
And it's no reflection on me that the
Captain wants you to oversee the work.

04:33.160 --> 04:36.436
That's right.
I was his chief engineer for four years.

04:36.560 --> 04:38.790
Well, it doesn't look like
he's ready to let you go.

04:38.920 --> 04:40.592
I'd better get on it.

04:45.680 --> 04:47.193
He thinks he's gonna
lose his promotion.

04:47.320 --> 04:49.754
Is there anything I can do to help?

04:50.200 --> 04:52.589
-With Kelby?
-With the engine.

04:53.720 --> 04:56.518
I could use a second pair of eyes
on the field matrix.

04:56.640 --> 04:59.154
The pattern's bothering me,
and I can't figure out why.

04:59.280 --> 05:01.555
-I'll take a look at it.
-Thanks.

05:01.680 --> 05:05.639
Commander, have you been
experiencing any unusual daydreams?

05:05.760 --> 05:06.715
Daydreams?

05:06.840 --> 05:10.515
Accompanied by intense auditory
and visual sensations...

05:10.640 --> 05:12.392
that would involve me.

05:14.520 --> 05:16.715
You're wondering if I've been
having any daydreams about you?

05:16.840 --> 05:18.034
Essentially.

05:18.720 --> 05:20.153
Well, let me think.

05:22.920 --> 05:25.718
-No, nothing comes to mind.
-Forget I mentioned it.

05:25.840 --> 05:27.398
Have you been having
daydreams about me?

05:27.520 --> 05:28.953
It's not important.

05:29.080 --> 05:30.832
You gonna tell me
what this is about?

05:30.960 --> 05:32.279
No.

05:34.400 --> 05:35.958
I am a privateer.

05:37.760 --> 05:40.069
My allegiance is to myself alone.

05:42.240 --> 05:46.472
I earn my living in various ways,
buying, selling.

05:46.960 --> 05:49.713
-Plundering?
-When the situation calls for it.

05:50.880 --> 05:54.316
Piracy is a risky business.
I prefer commerce.

05:54.800 --> 05:58.509
This is from a planet
in the Gorn Hegemony.

05:58.840 --> 06:01.832
-The Gorn?
-The less said about them the better.

06:02.280 --> 06:05.511
However, they brew the finest Meridor
in the five systems.

06:06.680 --> 06:08.875
-Delicious.
-I'm pleased.

06:10.360 --> 06:12.999
You have acquired something
of a reputation, Captain.

06:13.120 --> 06:14.599
Favourable, I hope.

06:14.720 --> 06:16.676
Well, you're wanted
in the Klingon Empire...

06:16.800 --> 06:18.358
the Orion Syndicate.

06:18.720 --> 06:20.950
I don't know.
I would have imagined such a man...

06:21.080 --> 06:24.595
would have a more robust appetite.

06:24.880 --> 06:28.190
With all those people after me,
I need to stay quick on my feet.

06:28.880 --> 06:29.835
Yes.

06:29.960 --> 06:33.077
You said you had something important
to discuss with us.

06:33.200 --> 06:37.876
Well, it's poor custom to discuss
business before entertainment.

06:39.360 --> 06:41.590
If the food didn't arouse your hunger...

06:43.360 --> 06:44.679
this should.

07:10.720 --> 07:13.917
-What do you think?
-I can't think.

07:16.840 --> 07:18.034
Captain?

07:19.560 --> 07:22.199
I'd have to agree with my tactical officer.

07:33.440 --> 07:35.192
I think she likes you.

07:44.840 --> 07:48.628
Her name is Navaar. She's the
most experienced of the three.

08:00.280 --> 08:04.796
They're sisters. I purchased them
at a trading post you once visited.

08:13.320 --> 08:15.197
Incredible, aren't they?

08:16.280 --> 08:19.192
They can make you forget most
of your troubles.

08:25.160 --> 08:28.675
Of course, creatures such as these
come with troubles of their own.

08:32.039 --> 08:35.191
But women are the same
throughout the galaxy, aren't they?

08:52.360 --> 08:54.032
Now we can talk business.

08:54.960 --> 08:58.509
He claims he's discovered a planet
with large deposits of magnesite.

08:58.640 --> 09:00.835
Enough to build 1,000 warp reactors.

09:00.960 --> 09:03.349
And that's just what
his scanners could detect.

09:03.480 --> 09:06.040
He's offering to give us the coordinates.

09:06.200 --> 09:07.997
Why would he divulge his information?

09:08.120 --> 09:11.396
He doesn't have the infrastructure
to get the magnesite out of the ground.

09:11.520 --> 09:14.751
So he wants Starfleet
to construct mining facilities.

09:14.880 --> 09:16.791
And he'll get a 10% share.

09:17.160 --> 09:19.151
He's also promised
to help establish a dialogue...

09:19.280 --> 09:21.555
between Starfleet
and the Orion Syndicate.

09:21.680 --> 09:24.797
-Are you going to accept his offer?
-I already have.

09:25.480 --> 09:28.119
I thought you were
here seeking my advice.

09:28.240 --> 09:30.470
Harrad-Sar insisted that I accept a gift...

09:30.600 --> 09:33.160
to celebrate the transaction.

09:33.880 --> 09:36.838
Given the situation, I couldn't refuse.

09:39.800 --> 09:44.078
We're on D-Deck now where most
of the crew quarters are located.

09:45.240 --> 09:49.836
-Where does Captain Archer stay?
-On E. That's one deck below us.

09:50.360 --> 09:52.112
How many levels are there?

09:53.160 --> 09:56.470
A total of seven. Seven decks.

09:56.960 --> 09:59.030
We've arranged these for you.

09:59.440 --> 10:01.476
You need something to do?

10:02.320 --> 10:05.312
The other two rooms are right next door.

10:05.440 --> 10:07.829
I'll show you in a moment.

10:16.800 --> 10:19.234
Captain Archer has a very large ship.

10:19.560 --> 10:22.791
-It's roomy.
-But everything's so functional.

10:23.360 --> 10:24.873
There's no colour.

10:25.520 --> 10:28.751
I hadn't really thought about it,
to tell you the truth.

10:28.880 --> 10:30.598
At least it's private.

10:34.320 --> 10:35.719
What's your name?

10:36.880 --> 10:39.110
Lieutenant Reed. Malcolm.

10:40.440 --> 10:43.238
Pleased to meet you,
Lieutenant Reed, Malcolm.

10:43.400 --> 10:44.833
Malcolm's fine.

10:45.240 --> 10:49.631
Well, someone will be by shortly
to show you how everything works.

10:50.640 --> 10:53.712
In the meantime,
just try to make yourself at home.

10:57.280 --> 10:58.349
Right.

10:59.920 --> 11:01.478
This way, ladies.

11:10.080 --> 11:12.036
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

11:12.160 --> 11:15.596
Harrad-Sar has turned over the
coordinates of the planet he described.

11:15.720 --> 11:17.915
We're en route to verify his claims.

11:20.120 --> 11:22.634
I've been hearing some concerns
from the crew.

11:23.160 --> 11:25.196
-Concerns?
-The Orion women.

11:25.400 --> 11:27.755
Their presence is becoming disruptive.

11:27.880 --> 11:29.438
You're telling me.

11:32.000 --> 11:35.151
The crew isn't used to having
Orions onboard.

11:35.280 --> 11:36.713
It's more than that.

11:36.840 --> 11:39.115
Our guests visited the Mess Hall
this morning.

11:39.240 --> 11:42.277
As a result, 12 crewmen
reported late for their shifts.

11:42.400 --> 11:43.435
I get the picture.

11:43.560 --> 11:46.518
-It's primarily their attire.
-Or lack of it.

11:49.680 --> 11:51.318
I'll see about assigning them
some clothes.

11:51.440 --> 11:54.557
It might also be a good idea
if you have a word with them.

11:55.320 --> 11:58.118
They're still under the impression
they belong to you.

11:58.240 --> 12:00.310
Unless a new policy has been instated...

12:00.440 --> 12:02.908
I believe Starfleet doesn't
condone slavery.

12:04.680 --> 12:07.399
-I'll speak to them first chance I get.
-Thank you.

12:11.640 --> 12:12.914
Lieutenant.

12:18.240 --> 12:22.233
-Have you seen them yet?
-I ran into one of them in the corridor.

12:22.880 --> 12:25.314
-They're really....
-Yeah, I know.

12:26.880 --> 12:28.108
I know.

12:31.040 --> 12:34.191
-What are you trying to do?
-Get them out of my head!

12:35.840 --> 12:37.239
The pain helps.

12:39.200 --> 12:40.758
You should try it.

12:44.000 --> 12:45.274
Yeah, okay.

12:48.280 --> 12:51.875
When I was on my parents' ship,
we picked up some Deltans once.

12:52.000 --> 12:55.151
-Their ship was having engine trouble.
-I don't know that species.

12:55.280 --> 12:58.556
The females are unbelievably attractive.

12:58.800 --> 13:01.155
Very open about....

13:06.360 --> 13:09.716
I was 15. I couldn't think straight.

13:10.120 --> 13:11.838
I could barely breathe.

13:11.960 --> 13:15.794
Only thing that got me through it
was weight-training with my dad.

13:16.120 --> 13:19.954
He said if I was exhausted,
idle hands and all that.

13:20.520 --> 13:22.078
Well, did it help?

13:22.840 --> 13:24.353
Helped my biceps.

13:28.760 --> 13:30.193
I'd go heavier.

13:50.880 --> 13:53.155
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to thank you.

13:53.280 --> 13:56.431
You were very kind this morning,
helping me find the Mess Hall.

13:56.560 --> 13:58.915
It was no problem. Look, l....

13:59.800 --> 14:02.394
Wow. Is that the engine?

14:03.120 --> 14:06.556
-It's the warp reactor.
-You can feel the power.

14:08.640 --> 14:10.437
You promised you'd show me
Engineering.

14:10.560 --> 14:11.834
I know.

14:12.320 --> 14:14.914
Harrad-Sar never let us
leave our rooms.

14:16.200 --> 14:18.475
I've never seen anything like this place.

14:20.480 --> 14:23.916
-I could show you around.
-lf it won't get you into trouble.

14:26.000 --> 14:27.194
Come on.

14:31.080 --> 14:33.275
What've you got for a headache?

14:34.040 --> 14:36.315
That depends on what's causing it.

14:37.280 --> 14:39.032
How long have you been
experiencing this?

14:39.160 --> 14:40.388
A few hours.

14:41.800 --> 14:42.869
What is it?

14:43.000 --> 14:45.753
Ensign Keely was here with a headache
several minutes ago.

14:45.880 --> 14:47.359
Is she all right?

14:48.040 --> 14:51.316
Perfectly. Just as you are.

14:53.080 --> 14:56.390
-It's probably just stress.
-Plenty of that going around.

14:57.480 --> 14:59.471
Or it could be our new passengers.

15:01.000 --> 15:03.753
The Orion females?
Why should they give you a headache?

15:03.880 --> 15:07.350
I'm just not used to seeing guys
trip over themselves like that.

15:07.800 --> 15:11.076
Just a little healthy sexual energy.
Helps keep the blood pumping.

15:11.200 --> 15:13.839
If you ask me,
it's pumping a little too hard.

15:13.960 --> 15:16.394
-I'm surprised at you, Ensign.
-Why?

15:16.520 --> 15:19.114
You never struck me
as being prone to jealousy.

15:19.240 --> 15:21.470
This should do very nicely.

15:24.440 --> 15:25.509
Phlox!

15:27.600 --> 15:29.079
It's all right.

15:30.120 --> 15:34.079
-Well, I must be nearing a sleep cycle.
-I thought you just had one.

15:35.720 --> 15:38.518
You're right, I did. A week ago.

15:41.160 --> 15:44.596
It's a good bet the problem's right there.
Take it apart.

15:53.560 --> 15:56.518
The injectors feed
into the dilithium chamber.

15:56.640 --> 15:59.393
That's where the matter
and antimatter mix.

15:59.520 --> 16:00.509
That's right.

16:00.880 --> 16:03.235
The crystals let you control the reaction.

16:04.080 --> 16:05.274
That's right.

16:05.400 --> 16:07.630
Lieutenant. Talk to you a second?

16:18.080 --> 16:20.799
-What's going on?
-Sir?

16:21.080 --> 16:24.390
You're supposed to be recalibrating
the EPS taps, not giving a tour.

16:24.520 --> 16:26.033
She's only been here
a couple of minutes.

16:26.160 --> 16:28.355
Not to mention the fact
that she doesn't have clearance.

16:28.480 --> 16:32.712
-You should have checked with me first.
-Well, I guess I can't do anything right.

16:34.280 --> 16:36.111
Just ask her to leave.

16:37.360 --> 16:40.477
No, sir. I'm not through talking to her.

16:40.760 --> 16:42.955
-That was an order.
-And I'm refusing.

16:43.200 --> 16:44.679
What the hell's the matter with you?

16:44.800 --> 16:46.916
You've been on my case
since the second you got back.

16:47.040 --> 16:48.598
That's what the hell's
the matter with me.

16:48.720 --> 16:49.948
And I'm telling you, it stops here.

16:50.080 --> 16:54.278
-Kelby, you're walking a fine line.
-So are you, Commander.

16:54.920 --> 16:57.832
-You're confined to quarters.
-And what if I don't want to go?

16:57.960 --> 17:00.679
It's either your quarters or the Brig.

17:02.760 --> 17:04.829
Get out of here, now.

17:21.280 --> 17:22.429
Come in.

17:34.640 --> 17:37.712
I was wondering when
you were going to come and see me.

17:38.160 --> 17:41.118
After all,
I've been your property for two days.

17:42.320 --> 17:43.514
Navaar...

17:44.240 --> 17:48.028
you and your sisters don't belong to me,
or anyone else.

17:49.280 --> 17:50.759
I don't understand.

17:51.520 --> 17:55.149
On my world, slavery's been illegal
for hundreds of years.

17:55.600 --> 17:58.751
Are you saying that you don't want us?

18:00.760 --> 18:04.514
I'm saying that you're here
as our guests...

18:05.600 --> 18:07.113
not our property.

18:09.280 --> 18:11.350
I've been a slave my entire life...

18:12.720 --> 18:15.393
on different worlds, for different owners.

18:16.440 --> 18:20.149
-What's going to happen to me?
-You're free to start a new life.

18:20.280 --> 18:22.999
In the meantime, I've asked
my protocol officer, Hoshi Sato...

18:23.120 --> 18:25.190
to brief you on ship's operations.

18:25.320 --> 18:28.437
There are certain areas that are
reserved for Starfleet personnel.

18:28.560 --> 18:32.758
I know what happened in Engineering.
I've already spoken to D'Nesh. I'm sorry.

18:34.120 --> 18:38.477
There's no reason to apologise.
It's a big adjustment for the three of you.

18:39.480 --> 18:41.311
May I ask you something?

18:46.360 --> 18:48.396
Do you find me attractive?

18:50.640 --> 18:52.551
I'd be lying if I said no.

18:53.240 --> 18:55.800
I've known so few honest men.

18:57.120 --> 18:59.759
And even though
you don't wish to own me...

19:01.080 --> 19:02.957
I still wish to please you.

19:03.640 --> 19:05.312
If I choose to do this...

19:10.560 --> 19:13.154
would that violate your ship's protocol?

19:14.360 --> 19:15.839
Not necessarily.

19:22.520 --> 19:24.397
Bridge to Captain Archer.

19:28.520 --> 19:30.397
Bridge to Captain Archer.

19:41.080 --> 19:43.958
-Archer here.
-We're coming up on the planet.

19:48.760 --> 19:50.432
I'll be right there.

20:04.800 --> 20:06.756
I recommend we go
to T actical Alert, sir.

20:06.880 --> 20:09.394
We can't be certain
this isn't some kind of a trap.

20:09.520 --> 20:10.475
Go ahead.

20:10.600 --> 20:13.068
We're already picking up large deposits
of magnesite.

20:13.200 --> 20:15.794
-Harrad-Sar was telling the truth?
-lt would seem so.

20:15.920 --> 20:17.194
Keep scanning.

20:18.480 --> 20:20.311
I want to know how much is down there.

20:20.440 --> 20:23.318
-Are you feeling all right?
-I'm fine.

20:26.560 --> 20:30.473
A power reading. Not on the surface,
in the upper atmosphere.

20:30.600 --> 20:32.989
-A ship?
-Uncertain.

20:34.560 --> 20:36.073
Try hailing them.

20:36.440 --> 20:40.115
The cloud layer is highly ionised.
It's obscuring our scanners.

20:40.280 --> 20:42.840
Get us closer, within 10 kilometres.

20:42.960 --> 20:45.838
-They're not responding.
-There it is.

20:47.800 --> 20:51.156
-It's an unknown configuration.
-They're locking weapons.

20:59.360 --> 21:01.510
Extremely low yield.
Barely scratched us.

21:01.640 --> 21:04.916
It's equipped with numerous sensors,
most likely a science vessel.

21:05.040 --> 21:07.349
Its presence here
could simply be a coincidence.

21:07.480 --> 21:09.038
They're firing again.

21:11.120 --> 21:12.439
No damage.

21:13.280 --> 21:15.316
They could shoot at us all day.

21:15.920 --> 21:18.354
-Phase-cannons.
-Sir?

21:18.840 --> 21:20.751
A phase-cannon hit will destroy them.

21:20.880 --> 21:23.997
Which means
they won't be shooting at us anymore.

21:24.120 --> 21:27.430
If we simply withdraw, they'll most likely
cease their attack and move on.

21:27.560 --> 21:29.232
And maybe they won't.

21:32.600 --> 21:34.079
Target them.

21:40.040 --> 21:42.349
-Lieutenant.
-Captain.

21:43.520 --> 21:45.158
Lock phase-cannons!

21:48.440 --> 21:49.395
No.

21:52.600 --> 21:54.909
Sir, they're moving off.

22:29.640 --> 22:31.790
I have just as much experience.

22:32.280 --> 22:35.716
-I'm smarter, younger....
-You're better than him.

22:39.080 --> 22:41.435
We're the only ones who think that.

22:42.360 --> 22:45.432
Tucker's going
to take back his position?

22:45.560 --> 22:48.996
He denies it,
but I know he's planning on staying.

22:49.640 --> 22:52.871
-lt doesn't seem fair.
-lt isn't.

22:55.720 --> 22:57.915
Let's not talk about it anymore.

22:59.600 --> 23:00.669
What?

23:00.800 --> 23:03.678
I'm used to being with men
who take what they want.

23:03.800 --> 23:05.153
What are you talking about?

23:05.280 --> 23:08.670
-You can't let him treat you like this.
-He's my superior officer.

23:09.400 --> 23:10.628
Where are you going?

23:10.760 --> 23:13.149
-I thought you were different.
-Stay.

23:13.280 --> 23:15.316
Wait, don't leave.

23:19.600 --> 23:23.070
What would you do to keep me forever?

23:24.200 --> 23:25.315
Forever?

23:27.880 --> 23:29.438
What would you do?

23:32.840 --> 23:36.116
Anything. Anything you want.

24:07.600 --> 24:08.669
Kelby!

24:15.280 --> 24:17.077
What the hell are you doing?

24:34.600 --> 24:37.353
Blow the dampeners! Move!

24:44.360 --> 24:46.112
He blew out every junction
in the EPS system.

24:46.240 --> 24:48.959
If we hadn't gotten to him,
we might not have a ship under our feet.

24:49.080 --> 24:50.035
When can we get underway?

24:50.160 --> 24:53.118
I'm not sure we can get underway.
He did a pretty thorough job.

24:56.360 --> 24:58.032
-Kelby.
-I didn't do anything!

24:58.160 --> 25:00.469
-Tell me what happened.
-Whatever he told you, it's a lie!

25:00.600 --> 25:03.433
Three other people were there, they all
saw you. Tell me why you did this.

25:03.560 --> 25:05.437
He's trying to get rid of me.
Don't listen to him!

25:05.560 --> 25:07.391
-Kelby.
-Captain, his adrenaline levels...

25:07.520 --> 25:08.589
are dangerously high.

25:08.720 --> 25:11.996
-I need to administer a sedative.
-Not till I get some answers first.

25:12.120 --> 25:14.918
In his current state
he can't give you coherent answers.

25:15.040 --> 25:16.473
I just want to go back to Engineering.

25:16.600 --> 25:18.477
-All right.
-I just want to go back to Engineering!

25:18.600 --> 25:19.749
Be quiet!

25:20.840 --> 25:22.319
What's wrong with him?

25:22.440 --> 25:25.318
It's the same thing
that's affecting everyone on this ship.

25:25.440 --> 25:27.476
It's a highly potent pheromone.

25:27.600 --> 25:30.239
When exposed to human males,
it accelerates the metabolism...

25:30.360 --> 25:33.432
causing aggression
and ultimately a form of delusion.

25:34.200 --> 25:35.235
The Orions?

25:35.720 --> 25:37.631
Women aboard the ship
have also been affected.

25:37.760 --> 25:39.512
I've received an increasing
number of complaints...

25:39.640 --> 25:41.915
about headaches and listlessness.

25:42.120 --> 25:43.473
I suspect the pheromone acts...

25:43.600 --> 25:46.068
as a defence mechanism
against competition.

25:48.400 --> 25:49.753
You okay?

25:51.400 --> 25:52.913
It's impacted my sleep cycle.

25:53.040 --> 25:57.511
I'm having to rely on stimulants
to stay awake.

25:58.880 --> 26:01.030
Doesn't seem to be affecting you.

26:01.520 --> 26:03.476
I've scanned
a good number of the crew.

26:03.600 --> 26:05.989
So far, the only people
who haven't been affected are T'Pol...

26:06.120 --> 26:08.873
-and Commander Tucker.
-Why me?

26:09.000 --> 26:10.831
I would have to run some more tests.

26:10.960 --> 26:13.758
But for the rest of us,
the effect seems to be cumulative.

26:13.880 --> 26:17.156
The longer we're exposed,
the more pronounced...

26:18.440 --> 26:19.919
the results are.

26:34.000 --> 26:37.913
So this is what you meant when you
said we were free to start new lives?

26:38.920 --> 26:41.070
We found this in your quarters.

26:41.280 --> 26:43.510
It seems we have no privacy, either.

26:43.640 --> 26:45.596
It's a communication device.

26:45.760 --> 26:49.719
You've been in contact with Harrad-Sar
as recently as two hours ago.

26:49.960 --> 26:51.279
And if I have?

26:51.400 --> 26:53.152
You were sent here to disable my ship.

26:53.280 --> 26:55.794
That was his plan
from the start, wasn't it?

26:56.480 --> 27:00.075
Harrad-Sar contacted me
to see if we'd been treated well.

27:02.680 --> 27:04.750
Dr. Phlox believes that...

27:04.880 --> 27:09.237
prolonged exposure to your
pheromones makes men delusional...

27:10.080 --> 27:12.071
and extremely vulnerable to suggestion.

27:12.200 --> 27:16.239
That's how you convinced Kelby
to sabotage our engines.

27:17.000 --> 27:21.278
Your crewman acted alone.
I had nothing to do with it.

27:22.920 --> 27:25.309
It seems the only delusion
here is your own.

27:25.440 --> 27:28.352
Damn it!
It's time to start telling me the truth!

27:28.520 --> 27:30.988
I'm worried about you, Captain.
You don't seem well.

27:31.120 --> 27:33.111
I'm not the one
you should be worried about.

27:33.240 --> 27:35.879
I can see you're not very experienced
at making threats.

27:36.000 --> 27:38.468
I'm a lot better at carrying them out.

27:38.760 --> 27:40.910
We were a gift, nothing more.

27:41.040 --> 27:44.635
A true commander would know
how to appreciate such a gesture.

27:46.200 --> 27:47.349
Tell me.

27:49.600 --> 27:51.670
When's he going to attack us?

27:53.880 --> 27:57.350
No one is coming to attack your ship.

28:00.280 --> 28:02.669
Please release us.

28:17.440 --> 28:18.589
Captain.

28:23.960 --> 28:27.157
I'm obviously not the only woman
with power over you.

28:46.280 --> 28:49.033
Get down to Engineering.
Do what you can to help Trip.

28:49.160 --> 28:52.869
-It's better if I stay on the Bridge.
-I don't need you to look after me.

28:53.000 --> 28:54.592
You're not immune
to these pheromones.

28:54.720 --> 28:57.473
-Your judgment is impaired.
-I can handle it.

28:57.920 --> 28:59.911
We need to get the engines back online.

29:00.040 --> 29:03.555
I don't want to be a sitting duck
when Harrad-Sar gets here.

29:04.760 --> 29:06.478
You have your orders.

29:13.920 --> 29:16.388
The Captain asked me
to offer my assistance.

29:16.520 --> 29:19.239
Great.
You can run through these diagnostics.

29:21.640 --> 29:24.154
See if you can find anything
that isn't fried.

29:28.160 --> 29:29.434
Do you really think
they're coming after us?

29:29.560 --> 29:30.549
It's likely.

29:30.680 --> 29:32.477
The transmissions sent
by the Orion females...

29:32.600 --> 29:35.592
suggest that Harrad-Sar's ship
is getting closer.

29:36.000 --> 29:39.629
You know, I keep thinking back to our
first mission when we met the Suliban.

29:39.760 --> 29:41.398
I was so damn naive.

29:41.520 --> 29:44.159
I actually thought it was the last time
we'd have to fight someone.

29:44.280 --> 29:46.157
-I said leave it alone!
-Get your hands off of me!

29:46.280 --> 29:48.271
Knock it off! That's an order!

29:48.400 --> 29:51.597
Start up again, you'll both end up
in the Brig! Understand?

29:51.720 --> 29:54.837
Now go help Masarro with the injectors.
Now!

29:57.680 --> 29:59.000
Get back to work.

29:59.000 --> 29:59.193
Get back to work.

30:02.760 --> 30:05.228
That's the third one in the last hour.

30:05.840 --> 30:08.559
There have been altercations
throughout the ship.

30:08.680 --> 30:11.274
The Captain's been affected.
I'm concerned about him.

30:11.400 --> 30:14.278
The thing I can't figure out is
why I'm immune.

30:14.840 --> 30:17.434
That might have something
to do with me.

30:17.760 --> 30:18.749
You?

30:18.880 --> 30:21.519
There's a long-held belief
that when a Vulcan mates...

30:21.640 --> 30:23.710
there's a shared psychic bond.

30:24.000 --> 30:25.513
We didn't "mate."

30:27.520 --> 30:30.318
Okay, what do you mean
by psychic bond?

30:30.640 --> 30:35.111
It's difficult to explain. Feelings,
thoughts, even images can be shared.

30:36.680 --> 30:38.511
-Those daydreams.
-What?

30:41.000 --> 30:44.879
When I said before that I wasn't
having any daydreams about you...

30:45.000 --> 30:46.797
it wasn't actually true.

30:49.160 --> 30:50.912
So if we're bonded...

30:52.400 --> 30:55.358
what does this have to do with me
not being affected by the Orions?

30:55.480 --> 30:58.677
I'm immune to the pheromones
because of my Vulcan physiology.

30:58.800 --> 31:01.758
-And you're making me immune?
-Apparently.

31:04.080 --> 31:08.198
I don't know whether to be relieved
or really worried.

31:15.520 --> 31:16.953
Tactical Alert.

31:20.760 --> 31:23.354
-Distance.
-400 kilometres.

31:24.720 --> 31:26.790
-He's hailing us.
-Put him up.

31:29.040 --> 31:31.952
Can I be of help, Captain?
Do you need a tow?

31:32.120 --> 31:33.872
We still have weapons.

31:35.040 --> 31:37.952
You're not going to get this ship
without one hell of a fight.

31:38.080 --> 31:42.153
I'd rather I didn't have to kill you,
but if that's what it takes.

31:42.880 --> 31:45.155
The Syndicate wants your head,
Captain.

31:45.280 --> 31:49.034
And they don't really care whether
or not it's attached to your body.

32:03.200 --> 32:06.636
-He's trying to knock out our weapons!
-Then take out his.

32:14.320 --> 32:16.470
Forward phase-cannons are down.

32:17.000 --> 32:19.560
-Protect our aft cannons.
-He's moving too fast.

32:22.880 --> 32:25.314
-Archer to Engineering.
-Trip!

32:25.440 --> 32:27.396
Can we get more power
to the thrusters?

32:28.160 --> 32:29.673
I'll see what I can do!

32:32.600 --> 32:34.477
We just lost aft cannons.

32:35.280 --> 32:38.078
Try to divert some of the power
from the grav-plating.

32:38.200 --> 32:40.350
We're going to be a little lighter
on our feet!

32:40.480 --> 32:42.516
What the hell,
I've been meaning to lose a few pounds.

32:42.640 --> 32:44.790
Reducing gravity plating to 90%.

32:44.920 --> 32:47.878
-Thrusters are back to full.
-Hard to starboard.

32:49.840 --> 32:52.035
-We're still too slow!
-Torpedoes!

32:52.720 --> 32:54.995
That last hit just took them out.

33:01.120 --> 33:03.270
He's powering down his weapons.

33:04.560 --> 33:06.118
He's coming about.

33:17.240 --> 33:19.037
Thrusters. Full astern!

33:20.960 --> 33:22.439
It's not enough!

33:23.880 --> 33:25.279
He's hailing.

33:29.400 --> 33:31.834
Relax, Captain. Enjoy the ride.

33:32.360 --> 33:33.839
We're not going anywhere.

33:33.960 --> 33:37.919
I'm afraid you have an appointment
with a pair of Orion marauders.

33:38.280 --> 33:40.919
I don't intend to keep them waiting.

33:41.280 --> 33:42.633
Release my ship!

33:42.760 --> 33:46.070
I can see you're upset,
and I sympathise...

33:46.280 --> 33:48.510
but it's truly out of my hands.

33:49.480 --> 33:52.278
We're both slaves to the situation.

33:57.680 --> 34:01.355
-They control you?
-You finally realise that.

34:02.680 --> 34:06.150
Yes, Captain, you've been operating
under a misconception.

34:06.280 --> 34:10.114
It is the men who are the slaves,
not the women.

34:16.960 --> 34:18.359
You see what I'm seeing?

34:18.480 --> 34:20.755
His grappler's directly
above our main deflector reader.

34:20.880 --> 34:23.757
Get up to the Bridge.
I'll be right behind you.

34:41.560 --> 34:42.708
The deflector?

34:42.840 --> 34:45.592
We can use it to send a positron burst
through the towing cable.

34:45.719 --> 34:47.676
If we're lucky,
it'll trigger an energy cascade.

34:47.800 --> 34:50.360
And disable his power systems. Do it.

34:50.760 --> 34:53.478
-T'Pol to Engineering.
-I've almost got it.

34:53.600 --> 34:55.875
You'll have to reroute
the main EPS conduit.

34:56.000 --> 34:56.760
Understood.

34:56.760 --> 34:57.158
Understood.

34:59.840 --> 35:01.034
Captain.

35:02.080 --> 35:03.035
Captain.

35:03.160 --> 35:04.960
-Decon Chamber, come in.
-There's no one there.

35:04.960 --> 35:06.359
-Decon Chamber, come in.
-There's no one there.

35:07.160 --> 35:10.072
-What did you do to my men?
-We asked them to leave...

35:10.200 --> 35:11.952
after they released us.

35:12.440 --> 35:14.476
They were very accommodating.

35:14.600 --> 35:16.158
Get off my Bridge.

35:17.240 --> 35:21.597
Is that what you really want?
Because if it is, I'll gladly do as you say.

35:22.960 --> 35:25.076
I only want to make you happy.

35:27.200 --> 35:29.509
I didn't think you wanted me to go.

35:29.640 --> 35:31.790
-Captain.
-She's jealous.

35:32.440 --> 35:35.989
She'll try anything to keep us apart,
she'll even destroy your ship.

35:36.120 --> 35:38.793
Her presence is affecting
your judgment.

35:39.120 --> 35:40.917
-Arrest her.
-Don't listen!

35:41.040 --> 35:42.553
-Do it.
-Captain!

35:43.120 --> 35:45.395
-Lieutenant Reed.
-Yes?

35:45.520 --> 35:47.590
Take T'Pol to the Brig.

35:48.000 --> 35:49.752
You heard your captain.

35:51.840 --> 35:53.034
Aye, sir.

35:56.360 --> 35:57.554
Stop him.

36:02.280 --> 36:03.599
We're ready.

36:14.960 --> 36:17.918
His engines are down.
Weapons, as well. It worked.

36:22.040 --> 36:23.632
Commander Tucker...

36:24.960 --> 36:26.359
I'm impressed.

36:27.880 --> 36:31.316
I'm beginning to see
who's the true master of this vessel.

36:32.000 --> 36:33.353
Save it.

36:33.480 --> 36:36.916
Captain Archer runs this ship.
You're sweet-talking the wrong guy.

36:37.040 --> 36:38.189
Let's go.

36:49.520 --> 36:51.397
Captain's Starlog, supplemental.

36:51.520 --> 36:53.909
The Orion women
have been returned to Harrad-Sar...

36:54.040 --> 36:56.713
who's headed home
at very low impulse.

36:58.480 --> 36:59.515
Okay.

37:00.960 --> 37:03.110
The dizziness should fade
in a couple of hours.

37:03.240 --> 37:04.275
Glad to hear that.

37:04.400 --> 37:06.311
At least the pheromones
are wearing off.

37:06.440 --> 37:09.352
I haven't thought about the Orions
for what, a whole 10 minutes.

37:09.480 --> 37:11.948
The entire crew's been bumping
into walls, it's like...

37:12.080 --> 37:13.672
someone spiked the water supply.

37:13.800 --> 37:17.190
The aftereffects will be around
for at least a few days.

37:18.640 --> 37:21.200
-Well done.
-Thank you, Captain.

37:21.320 --> 37:25.632
You'll be glad to know my log won't
mention your firing on a fellow officer.

37:25.760 --> 37:26.749
I appreciate that.

37:26.880 --> 37:29.838
A court martial would hardly be
a fitting ending to this incident.

37:29.960 --> 37:32.235
At least we've learned something
about the Orions.

37:32.360 --> 37:33.952
Yeah, the women are in charge.

37:34.080 --> 37:35.035
It proves that...

37:35.160 --> 37:38.550
even the most disagreeable species
have some positive attributes.

37:41.400 --> 37:44.710
-Was that my imagination?
-I don't think so.

37:46.000 --> 37:48.230
It almost sounded like
you were making a joke.

37:48.360 --> 37:49.509
At least, trying to make one.

37:49.640 --> 37:54.236
I assure you, if I ever decide
to make a joke, you'll know about it.

37:56.040 --> 37:57.189
There it is again.

37:57.320 --> 37:58.469
T'Pol, if I didn't know better...

37:58.600 --> 38:01.751
I'd think you were picking up
some of Trip's bad habits.

38:06.000 --> 38:08.719
-I guess we proved it again.
-Proved what?

38:09.800 --> 38:13.918
-That you and I make a hell of a team.
-We do seem to work well together.

38:14.520 --> 38:17.432
Even more,
now that we're in each other's heads.

38:19.320 --> 38:21.276
You're returning to Columbia?

38:21.400 --> 38:22.674
I imagine Captain Hernandez...

38:22.800 --> 38:25.030
is getting pretty antsy
to have her chief engineer back.

38:25.160 --> 38:27.674
There are still numerous repairs
to be carried out here.

38:27.800 --> 38:29.358
I think Kelby can handle them.

38:29.480 --> 38:31.869
He'd been observing my work
pretty carefully...

38:32.000 --> 38:34.070
when he wasn't trying
to blow up the ship.

38:34.200 --> 38:36.395
Kelby is a fine engineer,
but he lacks experience.

38:36.520 --> 38:38.397
Why don't you just say it?

38:39.240 --> 38:41.800
-Say what?
-That you want me to come back.

38:42.560 --> 38:44.073
I believe I did.

38:45.560 --> 38:49.917
I think your presence here would be
extremely beneficial to our operations.

38:50.040 --> 38:51.029
No.

38:52.400 --> 38:54.152
That you want me back.

38:55.440 --> 38:57.396
I don't know what you mean.

38:59.120 --> 39:01.680
My mistake. See you around.

39:02.520 --> 39:03.748
Wait. Trip.

39:09.760 --> 39:11.591
I want you to come back.

39:15.000 --> 39:17.719
-Then I'll think about it.
-Trip!

39:30.480 --> 39:31.993
Three days ago...

39:33.160 --> 39:36.914
I told Captain Hernandez
I wanted a transfer back to Enterprise.

39:37.440 --> 39:38.714
Three days ago?

39:38.840 --> 39:40.956
I realised this is
where I was meant to be...

39:41.080 --> 39:43.878
and that this thing between us...

39:45.680 --> 39:47.557
isn't that big of a deal.

39:48.800 --> 39:49.915
Agreed.

39:51.480 --> 39:53.755
Guess we got a lot of work to do.
