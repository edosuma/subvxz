02:09.651 --> 02:11.566
The police are looking for you.

02:18.355 --> 02:21.619
Leo is at my dad's house in Palm Springs. I just dropped him off.

02:29.366 --> 02:30.672
Why did you do this?

02:34.937 --> 02:36.504
I just wanted to see him.

02:43.337 --> 02:44.903
Charlie, are you okay?

02:53.042 --> 02:53.999
No.

02:55.262 --> 02:56.350
I'm not.

04:10.119 --> 04:13.992
Yeah. Uh, hi. I'm looking
for Mr. Garcia-Marquez.

04:15.255 --> 04:16.343
Charlie Bond.

04:20.129 --> 04:24.046
Okay. Yeah. Could you please
just let him know
that I-- I have the item

04:24.089 --> 04:25.482
that he is looking for.

04:27.354 --> 04:29.138
That's great.
Thank you. Thank you.

04:46.068 --> 04:47.112
Hello.

04:48.418 --> 04:50.638
Yes.
Uh, I just wanted to...

04:51.639 --> 04:55.164
let you know that I can be
in Nogales on Monday afternoon.

04:59.647 --> 05:03.303
Yes. And if-- if I could,
I just wanted to, uh...

05:07.394 --> 05:11.049
I just want to confirm
the details of our--
of our deal.

05:11.659 --> 05:13.661
Okay. Yes, Monday.

05:14.444 --> 05:15.445
Thank you.

07:11.866 --> 07:14.608
-Got your punk ass.
-Come on, guys.

07:14.912 --> 07:17.045
-Trying to get away, huh?
- What're you gonna
say now, punk?

07:17.088 --> 07:19.351
-Where's my money, bitch?
-I don't have it.

07:19.395 --> 07:21.919
-You told me that last week.
-I don't owe you guys anything.

07:21.963 --> 07:25.532
You owe me money.
We made a bet and you lost.
Pay up.

07:25.575 --> 07:27.708
-I don't have any money.
-Get his phone.

07:27.751 --> 07:29.449
-Phone is mine, bitch.
-Stop it.

07:29.492 --> 07:30.972
-Where's your phone?
-I'm tired of waiting for you.

07:31.015 --> 07:33.627
-You lost the bet. Pay up now.
-Get off me!

07:34.366 --> 07:36.673
-Pay up or you're dead.
-Hey! Hey, hey.

07:37.805 --> 07:38.849
Are you okay?

07:39.720 --> 07:40.808
What's the problem?

07:42.462 --> 07:43.506
All right.

07:43.550 --> 07:45.247
Lucky his daddy saved him.

07:45.290 --> 07:47.249
Yeah, lucky. Get out of here.

07:51.079 --> 07:52.472
Hey, you okay?

07:54.517 --> 07:55.475
Whatever.

07:59.566 --> 08:02.133
Leo, hold up.
Let me give you a ride.

08:02.786 --> 08:04.266
I don't want to go with you.

08:05.485 --> 08:06.442
Oh, really?

08:07.269 --> 08:08.792
You wanna go with them?

08:10.968 --> 08:12.492
Does Mom even know you're here?

08:13.275 --> 08:14.581
Of course she does.

08:17.453 --> 08:18.585
Let's go.

08:19.194 --> 08:20.195
Come on.

08:27.028 --> 08:29.073
- What was that about?
- Nothing.

08:30.118 --> 08:31.423
Didn't look like nothing.

08:33.730 --> 08:36.037
I'm fine. Okay?

09:06.763 --> 09:08.199
Why are you here, anyway?

09:10.898 --> 09:12.334
Sound disappointed.

09:12.769 --> 09:14.292
I just saved your ass.

09:17.295 --> 09:19.994
I was in the area.
I thought it would be fun
if I picked you up.

09:20.037 --> 09:21.343
Yeah, wow.

09:24.476 --> 09:27.349
You gonna tell me what happened?
They were gonna beat you up.

09:27.392 --> 09:29.960
-I could've handled it.
-Oh, really?

09:31.353 --> 09:33.529
You don't wanna get caught up
in that kind of thing.
All right?

09:33.573 --> 09:35.749
Trust me.
It'll do you no good.

09:36.140 --> 09:38.229
What do you mean,
"It'll do you no good"?

09:38.273 --> 09:40.014
You don't even know
what happened.

09:42.451 --> 09:43.539
Tell me then.

09:47.412 --> 09:48.544
I lost a bet.

09:49.632 --> 09:50.894
Now I owe him money.

09:52.069 --> 09:54.115
-Okay. How much?
-Three hundred.

09:54.681 --> 09:57.335
-Three hundred dollars?
-Whatever.

09:58.206 --> 09:59.599
What were you betting on?

10:03.559 --> 10:04.821
Baseball.

10:09.130 --> 10:11.872
-That was Mom's street.
-I know. I just gotta make
a quick stop.

10:21.185 --> 10:22.273
Anton?

10:22.839 --> 10:23.710
Yes?

10:39.769 --> 10:41.684
Hey, Charlie.
You're up late.

10:41.728 --> 10:44.426
-Wouldn't miss this.
Sold out yet?
-It's looking good.

10:54.262 --> 10:55.480
Shut the door.

10:57.352 --> 10:58.527
So, it came in?

10:59.571 --> 11:00.616
Sure did.

11:01.661 --> 11:02.705
"The Eclipse."

11:03.227 --> 11:05.795
I thought
it was the "Mondschein."

11:05.839 --> 11:08.319
That's what
the Nazis called it
after they stole it.

11:08.798 --> 11:10.713
That's what
I'm going to call it.

11:11.671 --> 11:14.064
- You got a buyer yet?
-Perhaps.

11:15.196 --> 11:18.286
You know, Anton,
if you wait two more years,
it's gonna be worth double.

11:18.329 --> 11:21.506
Would you wait two years
for your commission?

11:21.550 --> 11:23.291
You are ethically challenged,
my friend.

11:23.334 --> 11:26.424
And you are
financially challenged,
my friend.

11:26.468 --> 11:28.688
That is because
of the people I work with.

11:28.731 --> 11:30.907
Speaking of which,
do you have my commission
for the Rivas painting?

11:30.951 --> 11:32.256
Call me tomorrow.

11:33.301 --> 11:36.391
Um, Larry Greenburg, please.

11:39.002 --> 11:40.003
Yes.

11:46.793 --> 11:49.578
Do me a favor, all right?
See that gallery down there?

11:50.797 --> 11:53.103
It's closed now.
But there's a guy inside.
His name is Anton.

11:53.147 --> 11:54.714
He's got a check for me.

11:56.628 --> 11:57.586
So?

11:58.761 --> 12:00.328
So, just knock
on the door and get it.

12:00.371 --> 12:01.982
Why do I have to get it?

12:02.722 --> 12:05.463
Because. Just do it, okay?
I need the check.

12:06.334 --> 12:08.858
-You get it yourself.
-I get it, you get it.

12:08.902 --> 12:11.121
What does it matter?
Why are you giving me
a hard time, Leo?

12:11.643 --> 12:13.428
It's payment for your mom.

12:18.825 --> 12:20.043
You're a jerk.

12:55.383 --> 12:56.776
We are closed.

12:57.559 --> 12:59.213
You have a check for my dad.

12:59.866 --> 13:01.737
- Who are you?
-Leo Jackson.

13:02.172 --> 13:03.695
-Who?
-Leo Jackson.

13:03.739 --> 13:05.741
I'm Charlie Bond's son.

13:07.221 --> 13:08.091
Really?

13:26.631 --> 13:28.329
Why can't you just
give me the check?

13:36.119 --> 13:38.295
Because I don't know you.

13:42.734 --> 13:45.781
-Get out of here, punk.
-Hey. No, wait up.

13:55.965 --> 13:57.184
Come on, let's go!

13:59.316 --> 14:01.884
-That guy is a jerk.
-Yeah. Did you get the check?

14:01.928 --> 14:04.582
-No. He said get it yourself.
-Okay. That's fine.
I'll do that.

14:04.626 --> 14:07.107
-All right, let's go.
-What about your check?

14:07.150 --> 14:09.239
I'll get it tomorrow.
Come on, let's go.
You hungry?

14:09.283 --> 14:11.328
-So, you're not gonna get it?
-No.

14:11.372 --> 14:13.983
I will get it later.
You hungry? Let's get
something to eat.

14:14.636 --> 14:15.506
Yeah.

14:35.962 --> 14:37.224
It's good to see you.

14:38.225 --> 14:39.791
It means a lot to me.

14:41.793 --> 14:43.317
I know it's been a while.

14:44.144 --> 14:46.581
Something's happened,
nothing to do with you.

14:48.278 --> 14:49.801
And I've got to deal with it.

14:52.674 --> 14:53.718
What happened?

15:18.743 --> 15:20.093
What are you doing here?

15:20.136 --> 15:21.572
Can I come in?

15:22.660 --> 15:24.010
No, you can't.

15:24.967 --> 15:26.969
Please. We need to talk.

15:27.883 --> 15:29.450
This is important.

15:29.493 --> 15:31.408
If you needed to talk,
why didn't you call?

15:31.452 --> 15:35.586
I was going to, but I thought
that we should speak in person.

16:09.316 --> 16:10.404
Where's the opener?

16:11.492 --> 16:13.146
Nope. We're not doing that.

16:13.494 --> 16:14.495
Hey.

16:18.629 --> 16:20.283
What do you want?

16:24.679 --> 16:26.724
I'd like to take Leo
for the weekend.

16:29.423 --> 16:30.337
Really?

16:32.339 --> 16:34.994
-Well, that's not gonna happen.
-He's my son too.

16:35.037 --> 16:38.171
What are you talking about?
You haven't seen him in a year.

16:38.214 --> 16:41.348
Yeah, well, I had my reasons.
I don't expect you
to believe me.

16:41.391 --> 16:42.958
But I'm sorry.

16:43.002 --> 16:44.438
Are you sorry
for not making your payments?

16:46.918 --> 16:50.313
You're a fucking piece of work.
You think you can just
walk in and out of his life,

16:50.357 --> 16:52.272
because you have a moment.

16:53.534 --> 16:54.448
Come on.

16:55.710 --> 16:57.538
Let me take him for a few days.

17:02.195 --> 17:04.588
We had this conversation
in court.

17:04.632 --> 17:06.068
I'd like you to leave.

17:08.766 --> 17:10.333
-Oh, really?
-Really.

17:13.815 --> 17:15.164
This isn't about us.

17:15.904 --> 17:18.211
You can hate me all you want.
That's fine.

17:18.253 --> 17:20.082
Maybe I deserved it,
maybe I didn't.

17:20.126 --> 17:23.781
This is about him,
this is about him!
This is about his future!

17:23.825 --> 17:27.089
Oh, his future?
You're not in his future.

17:27.133 --> 17:29.570
-You didn't want this family.
-This is bullshit.

17:29.613 --> 17:31.963
And you're not gonna keep me
from seeing my son!

17:32.007 --> 17:33.269
Watch me.

17:33.313 --> 17:35.402
-Hey, stop.
-Don't touch me!

17:37.882 --> 17:38.840
Get out.

17:39.406 --> 17:40.450
Get out!

18:06.650 --> 18:07.695
That's me.

18:08.130 --> 18:09.827
Leave it. Leave it.

18:10.524 --> 18:11.394
Leo.

18:12.395 --> 18:14.136
-Don't answer.
-It's Mom.

18:14.180 --> 18:15.181
-Yeah. Don't answer.
-Mom.

18:15.224 --> 18:16.138
Give me that.

18:21.883 --> 18:22.753
Shit!

18:24.581 --> 18:25.669
Hello?

18:25.713 --> 18:27.541
Dammit. What are you doing?

18:27.584 --> 18:28.890
Sof, what?

18:28.933 --> 18:31.110
Charlie, what's going on?
Where are you?

18:31.545 --> 18:33.634
We're just having
a hamburger, okay?
It's all good.

18:35.070 --> 18:37.507
Put Leo on the phone.
Put him on the phone.

18:37.551 --> 18:39.248
-You can talk to him--
-I want to talk to Mom.

18:39.292 --> 18:41.032
-You can talk to him later.
-I want to talk to Mom!

18:41.076 --> 18:43.122
Listen, we're just spending
a little time together.

18:43.165 --> 18:45.211
No, you're not.
You're bringing him
home right now.

18:45.254 --> 18:46.212
Shut up.

18:47.648 --> 18:49.650
-My phone. That was mine.
-I will buy you a new one.

18:49.693 --> 18:51.739
-Turn back now.

19:01.749 --> 19:03.011
I'm gonna get my phone.

19:03.925 --> 19:05.056
Stop it.

19:06.493 --> 19:08.016
-Leo.
-What?

19:09.191 --> 19:10.714
Just help me out here, okay?

19:15.980 --> 19:17.417
License and registration.

19:17.721 --> 19:19.114
Uh, yeah.

19:20.898 --> 19:23.597
-Here. That's everything.
-Do you know why
I stopped you, sir?

19:24.337 --> 19:26.643
No, Officer.

19:26.687 --> 19:28.341
You swerved into oncoming
traffic back there,
almost caused an accident.

19:29.168 --> 19:32.040
Yeah, I'm sorry.
We had a situation
with the food.

19:34.085 --> 19:35.391
You okay?

19:35.435 --> 19:36.871
Looks like you got
in a mess there.

19:37.524 --> 19:39.134
I couldn't help it.

19:39.178 --> 19:41.223
My dad punched me in the throat
when I wasn't looking.

19:43.704 --> 19:45.009
Is that a joke, son?

19:46.272 --> 19:47.664
Is your face a joke?

19:51.929 --> 19:52.974
Wait here.

19:57.152 --> 19:58.197
What are you doing?

19:58.849 --> 20:00.416
You ruined my favorite pants.

20:03.898 --> 20:05.291
Don't say anything else, okay?

20:25.006 --> 20:27.226
Ever hear the saying
"clothes make the man"?

20:28.314 --> 20:29.228
What about these?

20:30.141 --> 20:31.360
Are those for bingo night?

20:32.056 --> 20:34.276
Well... not for nothing.

20:34.320 --> 20:37.366
I do know
a thing or two about trends.
It is what I do for a living.

20:39.847 --> 20:43.416
-So what do you do for a living?
-I'm an art dealer.

20:43.459 --> 20:46.636
I find struggling artists,
and I make them successful.

20:46.680 --> 20:48.159
How do you do that?

20:49.073 --> 20:51.902
Well... people listen to me.

20:51.946 --> 20:54.383
I can tell if a painting
has something to say,

20:54.427 --> 20:55.732
if it's relevant or not.

20:55.776 --> 20:58.300
It's a skill,
and people pay me for it.

20:58.344 --> 21:00.781
How do you tell
if something has value?

21:01.216 --> 21:02.391
It's a feeling.

21:03.871 --> 21:05.481
And if you don't feel it,
that means it's worthless?

21:07.744 --> 21:09.050
I could be wrong.

21:11.922 --> 21:15.883
Mom said you tried to be
a painter, but your art
was too shitty to sell.

21:15.926 --> 21:17.667
And you never got over it.

21:18.538 --> 21:19.756
She would say that.

21:25.414 --> 21:26.850
No way.

21:37.992 --> 21:39.036
Charlie?

21:45.739 --> 21:46.783
You're kidding, right?

21:47.175 --> 21:48.524
You would never wear that.

21:49.090 --> 21:50.134
Wanna bet?

22:07.543 --> 22:08.718
Where's my money?

22:11.242 --> 22:12.461
Do you want to double up?

22:13.854 --> 22:14.855
Sure.

22:14.898 --> 22:16.160
-Okay.
-What's the bet?

22:19.033 --> 22:21.252
I bet you can't spend
the whole day with me.

22:24.908 --> 22:26.083
I can't do that.

22:26.823 --> 22:28.172
Mom would never let me.

22:30.436 --> 22:31.393
Wanna triple it?

22:34.004 --> 22:36.267
-Three hundred?
-Mm-hmm, that's right.

22:43.449 --> 22:44.493
What are we doing?

22:45.799 --> 22:47.975
-Just a little trip.
-Where to?

22:49.193 --> 22:50.673
You'll know
when we get there.

23:19.920 --> 23:21.443
Good evening.
How can I help you?

23:21.487 --> 23:23.358
Uh, we would like a room
for the night.

23:28.319 --> 23:30.234
This place
has not changed a bit.

23:30.887 --> 23:33.934
I haven't been here since
I was a kid. Maybe a couple
years younger than you.

23:34.761 --> 23:37.938
My dad used to rave
about the, uh, the Negronis.

23:38.808 --> 23:40.244
You still serve that?

23:40.288 --> 23:41.942
Yes, I believe so, sir.

23:42.943 --> 23:44.727
The restaurant is open
until 9:00.

23:46.250 --> 23:47.251
Let's go.

23:56.435 --> 23:57.436
She's staring at us.

24:01.744 --> 24:04.878
Don't look.
She's probably a prostitute.

24:05.139 --> 24:07.271
-Like your friend?

24:07.924 --> 24:09.404
Like my friend, who?

24:09.448 --> 24:11.841
-The one Mom caught you with.
-Brooke?

24:14.148 --> 24:16.542
No, Brooke is not a prostitute.

24:17.673 --> 24:19.762
Brooke is somebody
I used to work with.

24:20.937 --> 24:22.286
That's what Mom called her.

24:28.815 --> 24:29.903
Mmm.

24:29.946 --> 24:31.295
I remember that snake.

24:32.340 --> 24:35.212
It was here when my dad
took me on a road trip.

24:35.865 --> 24:38.302
He wanted to show me a house
he was gonna buy.

24:39.608 --> 24:40.870
Because he was leaving us.

24:40.914 --> 24:42.306
And he only told me.

24:43.873 --> 24:46.876
And he said it was our secret
and that I couldn't tell her.

24:47.660 --> 24:49.879
He said he'd tell her
when he was ready.

24:49.923 --> 24:51.402
'Cause he met someone else.

24:53.535 --> 24:55.363
I watched my father...

24:56.843 --> 24:57.931
pretend...

24:58.932 --> 25:00.107
for a month.

25:02.588 --> 25:04.503
Pretend to care
about my mother.

25:05.242 --> 25:06.983
Pretend that we were normal.

25:07.593 --> 25:09.899
And that that's the way
it was always gonna be.

25:11.031 --> 25:12.162
Just pretended.

25:14.600 --> 25:16.123
I started to hate him.

25:18.952 --> 25:23.478
I hated him more than anybody
in my whole life.

25:27.961 --> 25:30.224
Then he told her,
"We're getting a divorce."

25:30.267 --> 25:32.356
And he left us
on the same day.

25:33.619 --> 25:35.142
My mom didn't even know
what hit her.

25:35.185 --> 25:38.406
I remember... going to bed...

25:39.625 --> 25:43.367
and as I was falling asleep,
I could hear my mother...

25:45.021 --> 25:46.936
in the living room, crying.

25:54.596 --> 25:55.641
But here we are.

26:00.210 --> 26:02.604
-You guys all done here?
-Uh, yeah. Thanks.

26:02.648 --> 26:04.345
-Okay.

26:06.173 --> 26:07.566
Let me show you something.

26:13.267 --> 26:15.399
That is our destination.

26:18.577 --> 26:21.057
- Where is that?
-Mexico.

26:21.101 --> 26:22.232
Mexico?

26:22.972 --> 26:24.191
- Yeah.
-That's far.

26:24.234 --> 26:26.672
Yeah.
But it's only for the weekend.

26:27.716 --> 26:28.761
But, hey...

26:29.805 --> 26:32.460
this is only between us.

26:32.503 --> 26:36.725
You can't say anything
to anybody, including your mom.

26:38.988 --> 26:40.773
That is my casita.

26:40.816 --> 26:44.254
-That's yours?
-Yeah, that's mine.

26:44.864 --> 26:47.214
This is
the most amazing beach...

26:49.085 --> 26:50.739
that you will ever see.

26:51.435 --> 26:53.699
And the water
is so crystal clear

26:53.742 --> 26:56.049
that you can see the fish
even at night.

26:57.703 --> 27:00.270
But you don't have to go
if you don't want to, you know?

27:00.314 --> 27:02.795
And I would totally--
I'll totally understand.

27:03.926 --> 27:05.406
You know, it's your call.

27:14.807 --> 27:15.895
I'm going.

27:28.124 --> 27:29.560
One too many.

28:03.551 --> 28:04.639
Charlie?

28:06.380 --> 28:07.773
Hey, it's me.

28:08.817 --> 28:10.384
Where are you?

28:10.427 --> 28:12.168
We're at a hotel.
I can't say where.

28:12.212 --> 28:13.735
I'm not supposed
to be calling you,

28:13.779 --> 28:15.824
but I just wanted
to let you know
that I'm okay.

28:15.868 --> 28:18.740
You need to come home.
Your father doesn't have
my permission to see you.

28:18.784 --> 28:20.568
He has my permission.

28:20.611 --> 28:23.571
-Excuse me?
-I said he has my permission.

28:23.614 --> 28:26.139
I don't even know
what you're doing.
Where are you?

28:27.183 --> 28:30.796
Your dad
is in some trouble right now,
and he's not being rational.

28:30.839 --> 28:33.363
I'm worried about you.
You need to tell me
where you are.

28:33.407 --> 28:35.757
-We're going
to his house in Mexico.
-Mexico?

28:36.758 --> 28:37.628
Yes.

28:38.325 --> 28:39.761
You need to listen to me.

28:39.805 --> 28:42.633
Your father doesn't have
a house in Mexico.

28:45.114 --> 28:46.768
He doesn't have anything.

28:46.812 --> 28:48.552
All he's got is debt.
He just owes people money.

28:48.596 --> 28:50.206
He doesn't have a house.

28:52.034 --> 28:54.167
-Then what's he doing?
-He would say anything.

28:54.210 --> 28:56.430
-Why am I here?
-I don't know.

28:56.473 --> 28:58.737
-But he's obviously
having some problems.
-I don't believe you.

28:58.780 --> 29:00.651
-You're lying.
-No, I'm not.

29:00.695 --> 29:03.176
Would you please just tell me
where you are?

29:59.972 --> 30:00.973
Charlie?

30:12.549 --> 30:13.681
What are those?

30:15.248 --> 30:16.902
Leo, none of your business.

30:18.773 --> 30:20.035
Why did you throw up?

30:21.645 --> 30:22.777
Get out!

30:45.669 --> 30:46.714
Good night.

31:27.233 --> 31:29.800
-How long
since you've been back there?
-Where?

31:30.366 --> 31:31.846
The house on the beach.

31:34.196 --> 31:35.937
Um, um...

31:37.286 --> 31:38.548
A couple years.

31:39.985 --> 31:40.942
That long?

31:42.465 --> 31:44.250
Yeah. I've been busy.

31:46.295 --> 31:49.777
It's a shame,
but I've got somebody
watching the place.

31:51.431 --> 31:52.780
Do they know we're coming?

31:53.781 --> 31:55.826
Do they know we're coming?
There's really no need.

31:56.392 --> 31:57.959
Maybe we'll just
surprise them.

32:40.741 --> 32:42.221
I wanna drive.

32:42.264 --> 32:43.352
No way.

32:43.744 --> 32:45.093
Then I wanna go home.

32:47.008 --> 32:47.878
Why?

32:47.922 --> 32:48.967
Because.

32:50.446 --> 32:52.492
Are you kidding?

32:52.927 --> 32:55.843
-It's totally illegal.
-There's nobody around.

32:56.583 --> 32:59.064
You don't know how.
I don't have time
to teach you.

32:59.107 --> 33:00.979
-Let's go, come on.
-I already know.

33:01.414 --> 33:02.806
So you don't have to teach me.

33:04.591 --> 33:05.809
I doubt that.

33:06.245 --> 33:07.420
It's your call then.

33:07.463 --> 33:10.423
But if you drive, we go back.

33:25.264 --> 33:27.005
Okay? Feel all right?

33:27.831 --> 33:28.919
Good?

33:30.356 --> 33:32.836
All right, keep it at 55, okay?
Five-five. You got it?

33:32.880 --> 33:34.490
-What are you gonna keep it at?
-Fifty-five.

33:34.534 --> 33:36.057
That's right, 55. Good.

33:39.104 --> 33:40.975
All right.

33:41.019 --> 33:43.108
Good. Now, right here.
Look. Second gear,
keep your hand on here.

33:43.151 --> 33:45.240
Right here.
Second gear is gonna stick.

33:45.284 --> 33:48.591
So, when you pull that down,
you're gonna ease off
the clutch, okay?

33:48.635 --> 33:50.071
Keep eyes on the road. Okay.

33:50.115 --> 33:52.421
Look, look, right here.
Leo, watch the potholes.

33:53.248 --> 33:55.033
-See them? Oh!

34:04.390 --> 34:05.869
-You okay?
-Yeah.

34:05.913 --> 34:06.870
Okay.

34:08.871 --> 34:10.744
All right,
take this right up here.

34:12.963 --> 34:14.922
I don't wanna get pulled over
by the cops again.

34:31.112 --> 34:32.940
Your mom ever tell you
why we broke up?

34:37.335 --> 34:38.772
-Huh?
-Yes.

34:38.815 --> 34:40.556
Yeah? Tell me what she said.

34:44.255 --> 34:46.344
She said
you're an evil maniac.

34:48.172 --> 34:49.435
Egomaniac.

34:50.130 --> 34:51.871
No. Evil maniac.

34:52.960 --> 34:55.353
She said you're
a borderline personality.

34:55.397 --> 34:58.096
You started sleeping around,
because you thought we weren't
good enough for you

34:58.139 --> 34:59.575
and that you could do better.

35:01.229 --> 35:03.144
She says that
you're an empty person
who lies and cheats

35:03.188 --> 35:05.059
-and that you're not a real man.
-Okay.

35:07.235 --> 35:08.802
I'm glad she's so objective.

35:11.239 --> 35:13.023
When you realized
you were a shitty painter,

35:13.067 --> 35:16.157
you started to hate yourself,
and then you blamed us.

35:16.636 --> 35:18.159
You wanna know why
I left your mom?

35:18.203 --> 35:19.769
I left her
because life is short

35:19.813 --> 35:21.858
and you only have
one life to live.

35:33.696 --> 35:38.092
Look, your mom is angry,
which is understandable
to an extent.

35:38.136 --> 35:41.269
Okay? But she's not rational.
There's two sides to a story.

35:43.706 --> 35:45.839
-Hey.

35:46.970 --> 35:48.494
-I'm talking to you, okay?

35:48.537 --> 35:50.104
This is important.

35:50.844 --> 35:53.151
-Hey. I said turn it off!

35:53.673 --> 35:56.110
-Not when I'm talking, okay?

35:56.154 --> 35:58.199
-I said turn it off
and keep that shit off.

35:58.243 --> 36:00.158
-Hey! Turn it off!

36:01.768 --> 36:03.857
And don't turn it on
until I say.

36:18.263 --> 36:19.829
-Pull over.
-What just happened?

36:19.873 --> 36:20.961
Pull over.

36:28.795 --> 36:29.796
Wait here.

36:44.202 --> 36:45.551
Son of a bitch.

37:13.535 --> 37:14.623
Can you fix it?

37:15.276 --> 37:16.886
What do you think
I'm trying to do?

37:29.943 --> 37:32.119
Goddamn it!

37:34.339 --> 37:35.427
Is it broken?

37:40.997 --> 37:43.086
Goddamn it!

37:49.005 --> 37:50.572
No signal.

37:54.097 --> 37:55.403
No signal.

37:56.752 --> 37:58.711
You were the one who told me
to come down this road.

37:58.754 --> 38:00.800
Yeah, and who was messing
with the radio?

38:15.380 --> 38:16.555
What are you doing?

38:18.208 --> 38:19.645
If you can't fix it, I will.

38:21.037 --> 38:23.779
Fix what?
You don't even know
what you're fixing.

38:40.492 --> 38:41.449
What's this?

38:43.843 --> 38:45.801
It's a spare key.
Give it to me.

38:52.417 --> 38:55.115
Come on, stop. Get up.
Get up. You don't know
what you're doing. Get up.

38:57.639 --> 39:01.034
Why do you drive
this shitty car, anyway?
Do you think it's cool?

39:01.077 --> 39:02.688
It's a piece of shit.

39:02.731 --> 39:04.472
You're not gonna talk to me
like that. I'm your father.

39:04.516 --> 39:07.301
-Since when?
-Always have been,
always will be,

39:07.345 --> 39:08.824
and that ain't ever
gonna change.

39:08.868 --> 39:11.218
You're not my dad.
You're just an accident.

39:12.698 --> 39:14.700
-You know what?
-Get the hell away from me!

39:15.875 --> 39:17.529
What are you--
Are you gonna hit me?

39:17.572 --> 39:19.661
Yeah? Is this like
some kind of man-to-man thing?

39:19.705 --> 39:21.576
You lied.
You're nothing but a liar.

39:21.620 --> 39:23.273
Lied about what?
I've never lied--

39:23.317 --> 39:25.406
-Leo!
-Your house!

39:25.450 --> 39:26.929
You don't have one.

39:27.408 --> 39:28.453
Liar!

39:29.062 --> 39:30.193
Mom told me.

39:31.020 --> 39:32.413
You don't have anything.

39:34.676 --> 39:36.199
Why are you doing this?

39:39.289 --> 39:40.900
What do you want from me?

39:46.384 --> 39:47.472
What are you doing?

39:49.212 --> 39:50.475
Where do you think
you're going?

39:53.478 --> 39:54.522
Leo?

40:00.267 --> 40:01.573
Leo, come here!

40:02.530 --> 40:03.966
Where are you going?

41:00.632 --> 41:01.676
Leo...

41:02.547 --> 41:03.983
Le...

42:10.092 --> 42:12.138
Thank you. Thank you.

42:17.186 --> 42:19.275
Hey. Someone's coming.

43:09.587 --> 43:11.240
I can hear that axle.

43:15.462 --> 43:17.029
You know,
I don't blame your mom.

43:18.073 --> 43:20.162
I don't like what you said...

43:22.077 --> 43:24.210
but she has the right
to be angry, you know? I...

43:25.907 --> 43:27.474
I did some stupid stuff.

43:33.523 --> 43:34.612
You know, she's...

43:37.266 --> 43:38.441
She's a good person.

43:42.141 --> 43:44.622
I, um...
I guess I just, uh...

43:45.797 --> 43:46.798
I don't know.

43:48.364 --> 43:50.149
I shouldn't have said
that stuff and...

43:53.282 --> 43:55.110
I shouldn't have said it.

43:55.589 --> 43:57.547
Do you have a girlfriend?
Boyfriend?

44:03.684 --> 44:04.772
-No.
-No.

44:05.730 --> 44:07.079
No further questions.

45:03.918 --> 45:04.832
Right here.

45:10.272 --> 45:11.317
All right.

45:12.318 --> 45:13.972
-Hey. How goes it?
-Hey. How are you?

45:14.015 --> 45:16.801
-Uh, I would like a room
for my son and I.
-All right.

45:17.584 --> 45:19.673
Just fill that out
for me here.

45:19.717 --> 45:21.893
No. I'm not sharing
a room with him.

45:23.068 --> 45:24.199
I want my own.

45:25.331 --> 45:27.115
That's fine?
Are you gonna pay for it?

45:30.031 --> 45:31.206
-That's good.
-Okay.

45:36.646 --> 45:38.039
- All right.
- Here you go.

45:38.605 --> 45:41.564
We have 121 for you. 121.

45:41.608 --> 45:42.783
Excellent.
Thank you very much.

45:53.272 --> 45:54.752
You might wanna
change out of that.

45:57.232 --> 45:58.277
I'm good.

45:59.844 --> 46:00.758
All right.

46:02.063 --> 46:04.500
Uh, well, I'm gonna
take the car down and, uh--

46:05.197 --> 46:08.243
I'm gonna get it looked at,
see if I can get that
rattling sound fixed.

46:08.940 --> 46:11.681
Maybe when I get back,
we'll, uh, grab some dinner?
Cool?

46:14.075 --> 46:15.033
Okay.

46:15.555 --> 46:16.817
All right. Um...

46:17.687 --> 46:20.212
Oh. There you go.
Watch some TV.

46:20.255 --> 46:21.343
No porn.

47:23.579 --> 47:24.493
Charlie?

47:24.537 --> 47:25.625
Anton, what's up?

47:26.017 --> 47:27.583
I met your son.

47:28.062 --> 47:30.891
Yeah, so I heard.
You make a great impression.

47:31.979 --> 47:35.983
-I'm sitting here
with Gemini, Charlie.
-Hey, Charlie.

47:38.377 --> 47:39.944
My man, how's it going?

47:40.683 --> 47:43.817
Everything is everything.
-Yeah. Right?

47:45.950 --> 47:47.908
How are we going to do this?

47:51.259 --> 47:52.391
Here's the thing.

47:54.175 --> 47:55.263
You're out of luck.

47:56.351 --> 47:58.353
I'm already gone.

47:58.397 --> 48:00.616
-Who are you gonna sell it to?
-I don't give a shit anymore.

48:01.574 --> 48:04.794
Charlie, I spoke
to Mr. Wilson today.

48:04.838 --> 48:07.188
Mr. Wilson. Fantastic.
Who's that?

48:07.232 --> 48:09.843
He's your son's
English teacher.

48:10.757 --> 48:12.541
At Spring Valley Middle School.

48:12.585 --> 48:14.892
Do you know
what he got on his midterm?

48:17.242 --> 48:19.070
No, Gemini. Tell me.

48:19.113 --> 48:20.375
He got an A.

48:24.423 --> 48:25.467
Shit.

48:33.345 --> 48:34.215
Leo?

48:35.042 --> 48:36.957
Leo. Hey, I'm back.

48:49.665 --> 48:52.364
Excuse me. Um, I checked in
with my son earlier today.

48:52.407 --> 48:54.757
-You haven't seen him, have you?
-I haven't, sir.

49:02.374 --> 49:03.331
Leo?

49:05.464 --> 49:06.465
Leo?

49:09.033 --> 49:09.947
Leo.

49:19.043 --> 49:21.219
Leo, do me a favor.

49:21.262 --> 49:24.222
For the rest of this trip,
I don't want you leaving
the room without telling me.

49:24.265 --> 49:26.398
Okay? I was looking
all over for you.

49:27.573 --> 49:28.530
Hey.

49:28.835 --> 49:30.663
Hey, I'm talking to you.
Look at me.

49:33.057 --> 49:34.145
What did you do?

49:35.668 --> 49:36.843
Did you go swimming?

49:39.237 --> 49:41.761
I think we should
stay the night,
and in the morning...

49:42.718 --> 49:45.591
I think--
I think we should go home.

49:50.074 --> 49:51.031
Go home?

49:53.860 --> 49:54.774
Is that a joke?

49:56.689 --> 49:58.343
I don't think
this is a good idea.

49:58.691 --> 50:00.693
You mom is really upset
right now.

50:03.870 --> 50:05.132
So, you are lying?

50:06.568 --> 50:07.439
No.

50:08.875 --> 50:10.398
You don't have a house.

50:12.139 --> 50:14.272
Leo, here's the thing, okay?
It's complicated, but I know--

50:14.315 --> 50:17.057
What? Did you meet a girl?

50:17.492 --> 50:19.407
-No.
-You need some space?

50:19.451 --> 50:20.887
-Listen to me--
-Get off!

50:21.366 --> 50:22.932
Hey, relax.

50:23.455 --> 50:25.718
Can I help you?
Is everything okay?

50:25.761 --> 50:28.416
Yes. Yeah.
We just ordered some fries.

50:30.723 --> 50:32.812
What is wrong with you?
What is this? Hey!

50:32.855 --> 50:34.553
What are you doing?
Where did you get this?

50:34.596 --> 50:36.598
-What do you care?
-Hey!

50:36.642 --> 50:37.730
You're an asshole!

50:41.603 --> 50:43.692
Leo. Leo, wait.

50:43.736 --> 50:46.217
Come here, Leo.
I need to talk to you now.

50:46.695 --> 50:47.957
Leo, stop!

50:48.567 --> 50:49.568
Will you please...

50:50.699 --> 50:52.440
Will you listen to me? Leo.

50:54.573 --> 50:56.836
Leo, talk to me! Leo, stop!

50:56.879 --> 50:59.360
Just go! Leave me alone!

50:59.404 --> 51:01.710
Why are you causing a scene?
You're embarrassing me.

51:01.754 --> 51:03.321
I'm embarrassing you?

51:04.191 --> 51:07.847
This is my dad, everyone.
Right here!

51:07.890 --> 51:10.980
He cheated on my mom.
He lied to me!

51:11.024 --> 51:13.983
No! He's a pathetic loser!

51:16.073 --> 51:18.988
But other than that,
he's a great guy.

51:19.032 --> 51:19.946
Leo, no...

51:19.989 --> 51:21.208
You win.

51:21.817 --> 51:23.384
Leave me alone!

53:49.356 --> 53:50.401
Mr. Bond.

53:52.185 --> 53:53.534
How are you feeling
this morning?

53:55.014 --> 53:56.668
Can you see me clearly?

53:57.625 --> 53:58.844
Yeah.

53:58.887 --> 54:00.280
Do you have a headache?

54:00.715 --> 54:02.543
No. Where's my son?

54:02.587 --> 54:05.111
He's here at the hospital.
He spent the night
in the guest room.

54:10.290 --> 54:12.031
I, um...

54:13.511 --> 54:15.817
-I spoke to your doctor.

54:20.387 --> 54:22.955
I understand that you have
a stage 4 brain tumor.

54:25.218 --> 54:27.046
You really should be
in treatment.

54:28.482 --> 54:29.875
You're a very sick man.

54:30.876 --> 54:32.269
I'm not sick.

54:32.791 --> 54:34.271
I'm dying.

54:37.970 --> 54:39.711
You could save yourself
a lot of pain.

54:40.494 --> 54:42.583
Thank you.

54:53.768 --> 54:57.250
Can I ask you, um,
is your son aware?

54:58.207 --> 55:00.558
He'll know... soon enough.

55:02.516 --> 55:04.388
I would advise you
to think this through.

55:05.432 --> 55:06.738
Every single day counts.

55:07.739 --> 55:10.655
And this...
doesn't just affect you.

55:11.612 --> 55:12.961
It affects
everyone around you.

55:17.618 --> 55:19.228
Oh. Well, there he is.

55:21.187 --> 55:22.841
I want to run a few more tests,
and then we'll speak again.
All right?

55:23.842 --> 55:24.669
Come on in.

55:25.104 --> 55:25.974
Come in.

55:33.068 --> 55:34.505
How's the hangover?

55:36.463 --> 55:37.638
What's wrong with you?

55:41.163 --> 55:43.122
I just gotta take it easy
for a while.

55:44.515 --> 55:46.473
No more punches to the face.

55:46.952 --> 55:48.127
Sorry I hit you.

55:52.871 --> 55:54.046
I think I deserved it.

55:56.831 --> 55:58.093
Did it feel good?

56:01.967 --> 56:03.447
-I don't remember.

56:08.147 --> 56:10.367
The hotel put your car
in the parking lot.

56:15.328 --> 56:16.503
Can I have this?

56:17.417 --> 56:18.287
Yes, you can.

56:41.833 --> 56:43.487
Excuse me.

56:43.530 --> 56:46.490
I just want to let you know
your cousin is on the way up.

56:47.404 --> 56:48.317
Cousin?

56:48.709 --> 56:50.407
-Who?
-Anton.

56:52.670 --> 56:53.888
I forgot.

56:54.976 --> 56:57.414
He called last night.
Is he your cousin?

56:58.893 --> 57:00.591
He wanted to give you
the paycheck.

57:05.204 --> 57:08.120
-Where's the car?
-Second level, way in the back.

57:08.163 --> 57:10.905
Okay. Where's...
Where's my phone?

57:11.819 --> 57:12.994
No, no, keep it.

57:13.038 --> 57:14.431
Um...

57:15.040 --> 57:18.347
Okay, listen.
I need you to listen to me.
All right?

57:19.261 --> 57:20.393
He can't see you.

57:21.046 --> 57:23.440
All right.
Okay, I need you to do this.

57:23.483 --> 57:24.876
Why can't they see me?

57:25.485 --> 57:28.227
I'll take care of this,
but if I'm not back in an hour,

57:28.270 --> 57:30.708
Leo, you need to call your mom.
She's gonna come pick you up.

57:31.578 --> 57:34.102
What do you mean if
you're not back in an hour?
Shouldn't I call the cops?

57:34.146 --> 57:37.845
No, do not call the police.
If you call the police,
I go to jail. Okay?

58:21.367 --> 58:22.499
Here we are.

58:26.938 --> 58:28.330
Is everything all right?

58:30.202 --> 58:31.159
I'm fine.

58:44.042 --> 58:46.827
Garcia was
the first call I made.

58:49.308 --> 58:50.178
Well?

58:52.529 --> 58:54.052
He's not going to buy it.

59:02.843 --> 59:03.888
Do you have it?

59:06.107 --> 59:07.152
It's right here.

59:07.674 --> 59:08.545
Where?

59:08.936 --> 59:09.850
In the back.

59:32.046 --> 59:33.526
Any damage?

59:34.135 --> 59:35.441
Never took it out.

59:37.399 --> 59:38.879
What do you say?

59:40.751 --> 59:41.665
Excuse me?

59:42.927 --> 59:45.016
What do you say
if someone punches your neck?

59:47.148 --> 59:48.149
Charlie.

59:54.460 --> 59:56.810
Charlie, Charlie...

59:57.376 --> 59:58.856
You have to improve
your vocab--

01:00:05.166 --> 01:00:06.211
Get down!

01:00:06.820 --> 01:00:07.865
Leo.

01:00:08.692 --> 01:00:10.607
Leo. Leo, put down the gun.

01:00:10.650 --> 01:00:12.173
- Listen to your dad.
- On the ground!

01:00:12.217 --> 01:00:14.001
- Leo!
- Do it!

01:00:15.089 --> 01:00:17.091
Leo, put down the gun
and walk away.

01:00:17.135 --> 01:00:18.310
Why?

01:00:18.353 --> 01:00:19.659
-What's that?
- Nothing.

01:00:19.703 --> 01:00:21.530
-Shut up!
-It belongs to me.

01:00:25.273 --> 01:00:26.448
Get their keys.

01:00:27.145 --> 01:00:28.712
Listen to your daddy, kid.

01:00:29.495 --> 01:00:31.410
Check their pockets
and get their keys.

01:00:31.889 --> 01:00:33.804
- Leo, listen.
-Do it.

01:00:33.847 --> 01:00:37.503
-Give me the gun.
You don't wanna do this.
-Kid, put the gun down.

01:00:38.286 --> 01:00:39.853
-Put it down.
- Leo.

01:00:40.854 --> 01:00:42.464
You don't wanna do this.

01:00:44.423 --> 01:00:45.598
Do it!

01:00:54.738 --> 01:00:56.870
- Whoa!

01:00:56.914 --> 01:00:58.089
Who were those guys?

01:00:58.959 --> 01:01:01.527
-Are they gonna come after us?

01:01:03.050 --> 01:01:03.964
Charlie?

01:01:24.332 --> 01:01:25.682
Goddamn it.

01:01:28.597 --> 01:01:29.555
Shit!

01:01:30.861 --> 01:01:32.427
-What's the matter?
-Why would you do that?

01:01:35.256 --> 01:01:38.695
When I tell you to do something,
you do it! Okay?

01:01:39.347 --> 01:01:41.610
-They were gonna hurt you!
-Who cares?

01:01:43.482 --> 01:01:44.613
It's not your problem.

01:01:46.441 --> 01:01:48.966
-I saved you!
-No, you didn't.

01:01:49.009 --> 01:01:52.273
No one can save me.
You worry about yourself.

01:01:52.317 --> 01:01:53.797
That's all you can do.

01:02:42.149 --> 01:02:43.368
What did you get in English?

01:02:44.630 --> 01:02:45.587
What?

01:02:46.371 --> 01:02:47.851
On your midterm?

01:02:48.590 --> 01:02:50.854
-Last semester?
-Yeah, whatever.

01:02:52.290 --> 01:02:53.378
I got an A.

01:02:56.990 --> 01:02:57.948
That's pretty good.

01:03:02.300 --> 01:03:04.128
All right, listen,
we have to make a detour.

01:03:08.567 --> 01:03:10.090
Are we still going to Mexico?

01:03:11.570 --> 01:03:12.789
I'm working on it.

01:04:15.895 --> 01:04:17.331
My mom was a painter.

01:04:18.767 --> 01:04:21.640
I'd come up here with her,
and we'd stake out a spot.

01:04:24.034 --> 01:04:26.819
Get here early in the morning
right when the sun
was coming up.

01:04:30.518 --> 01:04:32.172
The thing about painting is

01:04:32.216 --> 01:04:34.305
when you're doing it,
you get so involved that...

01:04:35.523 --> 01:04:36.873
just lose track of time.

01:04:43.618 --> 01:04:45.316
I used to think
my mom was a failure

01:04:45.359 --> 01:04:47.796
because she never sold
a painting in her life.

01:04:51.278 --> 01:04:52.323
She loved it.

01:04:59.417 --> 01:05:02.724
That's all that counts...
in life.

01:05:02.768 --> 01:05:05.989
That's all that counts,
and everything else is nonsense.

01:05:22.875 --> 01:05:26.096
This painting was stolen
during World War II.

01:05:26.705 --> 01:05:28.446
Original owner was killed.

01:05:28.489 --> 01:05:31.275
It was found in Argentina,
then it went missing again.

01:05:31.318 --> 01:05:33.407
It's been selling
on the black market for years.

01:05:33.451 --> 01:05:35.540
Anton was gonna get
a million for it.

01:05:38.151 --> 01:05:40.110
A million bucks.

01:05:40.153 --> 01:05:42.721
A piece of art is worth
whatever a buyer
will pay for it.

01:05:44.549 --> 01:05:46.420
What would you do
with a million bucks?

01:05:49.641 --> 01:05:50.947
What would you do?

01:05:56.256 --> 01:05:58.519
All right. Come on.

01:05:58.563 --> 01:06:00.957
I gotta make one more stop
because there's somebody
I want you to meet.

01:06:40.822 --> 01:06:43.216
I haven't even spoken to him
since my mom's funeral.

01:06:44.043 --> 01:06:45.610
Are you sure
he still lives here?

01:06:54.097 --> 01:06:55.533
-Hey.
-Hey, Dad.

01:07:01.017 --> 01:07:02.148
What are you doing here?

01:07:04.063 --> 01:07:06.370
I just need to talk
for a few minutes. Please.

01:07:08.154 --> 01:07:10.417
-What, did you get lost
or something?
-No.

01:07:13.899 --> 01:07:15.031
Can we come in?

01:07:18.077 --> 01:07:20.079
-Yeah, yeah. Come on in.
-Thanks.

01:07:24.866 --> 01:07:27.478
-Do you want a drink?
-No. No, thanks.

01:07:27.521 --> 01:07:28.957
-No?
-Don't have the time.

01:07:29.741 --> 01:07:30.959
It's okay.

01:07:32.222 --> 01:07:33.962
Is this your mom?

01:07:34.006 --> 01:07:37.140
Yes. She would've been 68.

01:07:37.183 --> 01:07:38.402
Last week.

01:07:40.099 --> 01:07:42.667
-I'm sorry to drop in like this.
-No problem.

01:07:43.276 --> 01:07:44.843
It's only been a few years.

01:07:46.758 --> 01:07:49.326
-So, are you gonna be around
for a few days or what?
- Um...

01:07:49.804 --> 01:07:50.762
Are you okay?

01:07:52.111 --> 01:07:53.243
Yeah.

01:07:54.287 --> 01:07:56.115
I will be.

01:07:56.159 --> 01:07:58.683
Uh, things are a little
messed up right now,
but I'm fixing it.

01:07:58.726 --> 01:08:00.641
I needed somebody to watch him
for a couple of hours.

01:08:00.685 --> 01:08:02.513
Oh, sure.
That's cool.

01:08:02.556 --> 01:08:04.993
So, uh, what is it?
It's Leo, right?

01:08:05.690 --> 01:08:07.909
Yeah.

01:08:07.953 --> 01:08:10.869
You know, I remember when
you were about that big.
You remember that?

01:08:11.522 --> 01:08:13.350
No? That's okay.

01:08:14.090 --> 01:08:16.613
-How'd you like a drink?
-Sure.

01:08:18.006 --> 01:08:19.269
I'll be right back.

01:08:27.015 --> 01:08:30.149
I'll see you later.
I'll just be at a hotel
down the road.

01:08:31.019 --> 01:08:32.412
Are you meeting those guys?

01:08:32.716 --> 01:08:34.457
Of course not.

01:08:35.937 --> 01:08:37.243
Don't worry about that.

01:08:38.505 --> 01:08:40.158
That's gonna get taken care of.

01:08:44.859 --> 01:08:46.644
- Dad?
-Yeah?

01:08:51.649 --> 01:08:53.171
Are you sure
you're okay with him?

01:08:53.216 --> 01:08:54.912
Oh, yeah, I'm fine.

01:08:54.956 --> 01:08:56.654
Sofia, how's she doing?

01:08:59.569 --> 01:09:01.093
We're not together anymore.

01:09:02.834 --> 01:09:04.140
When did that happen?

01:09:06.620 --> 01:09:07.881
Five years ago.

01:09:10.102 --> 01:09:11.625
-Five years.
-Yeah.

01:09:14.237 --> 01:09:15.803
History repeats itself.

01:09:17.240 --> 01:09:18.979
I'm really sorry
to hear that.

01:09:20.156 --> 01:09:21.287
I'm sorry too.

01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:25.073
But... she's a survivor.

01:09:26.205 --> 01:09:27.292
So is Leo.

01:09:30.644 --> 01:09:31.819
You're looking good, Dad.

01:09:33.908 --> 01:09:36.607
I forgot
it was Mom's birthday
last week. I miss her.

01:09:37.477 --> 01:09:38.738
I miss her a lot.

01:09:49.272 --> 01:09:50.533
I miss her too.

01:10:16.734 --> 01:10:19.693
-You like a room?
-Yeah, just for a few hours.

01:10:19.737 --> 01:10:21.782
Doesn't matter.
It's thirty bucks.

01:10:22.696 --> 01:10:23.654
Fine.

01:10:44.370 --> 01:10:45.937
Why did you do this?

01:10:49.375 --> 01:10:50.942
I just wanted to see him.

01:10:52.291 --> 01:10:54.946
You never wanted to see him.
Why now?

01:11:00.821 --> 01:11:02.475
You gonna tell me
what's going on?

01:11:07.959 --> 01:11:09.569
Charlie, are you okay?

01:11:15.967 --> 01:11:20.363
You don't have to
wait for dinnertime to enjoy
the famed Scarlet O'Hara.

01:11:20.885 --> 01:11:23.714
Enchanting as its namesake.

01:11:23.757 --> 01:11:25.890
Here's a drink
that tastes great anytime.

01:11:26.456 --> 01:11:27.457
Ah, boy.

01:11:34.028 --> 01:11:35.291
Hello.

01:11:36.379 --> 01:11:37.249
Sofia?

01:11:39.512 --> 01:11:41.166
-Is that Mom?
-Yeah.

01:11:41.819 --> 01:11:43.951
No, go ahead.
Yeah, it's okay.

01:11:45.518 --> 01:11:46.519
What's wrong?

01:11:54.745 --> 01:11:55.702
Right.

01:11:59.010 --> 01:11:59.967
Okay.

01:13:05.250 --> 01:13:06.512
Turn around, Charlie.

01:13:22.267 --> 01:13:23.355
No.

01:13:35.672 --> 01:13:36.803
Where is it?

01:13:39.545 --> 01:13:40.503
Where is it?

01:13:43.462 --> 01:13:44.768
Is this a joke?

01:13:45.464 --> 01:13:46.552
Get back!

01:13:49.512 --> 01:13:50.469
Get back.

01:13:55.779 --> 01:13:57.041
Leo!

01:14:02.002 --> 01:14:03.090
Charlie.

01:14:04.048 --> 01:14:04.962
Wake up.

01:14:05.832 --> 01:14:07.747
-Charlie.

01:14:07.791 --> 01:14:09.053
Can you hear me?

01:14:09.619 --> 01:14:10.576
Wake up.

01:14:12.622 --> 01:14:13.666
Where are we?

01:14:14.798 --> 01:14:16.190
They put us in the truck.

01:14:19.019 --> 01:14:21.239
- You okay?
-Yeah.

01:14:26.853 --> 01:14:27.985
Is it true?

01:14:30.074 --> 01:14:33.077
I just couldn't--
I just couldn't tell you.

01:14:34.208 --> 01:14:35.645
I didn't know how.

01:14:37.255 --> 01:14:38.474
I wanted to...

01:14:40.040 --> 01:14:42.042
I wanted to tell you
when we got there.

01:15:10.897 --> 01:15:11.985
Charlie.

01:15:13.421 --> 01:15:14.510
Charlie.

01:15:19.558 --> 01:15:20.472
Charlie!

01:15:21.038 --> 01:15:22.082
Get up!

01:15:26.609 --> 01:15:28.567
I want to show you something.

01:15:37.184 --> 01:15:38.185
Are you okay?

01:15:39.012 --> 01:15:41.232
-He's not a part of this.
-He is now.

01:15:41.275 --> 01:15:42.712
- Get off!
-Sit down.

01:15:43.147 --> 01:15:45.236
-No!
- Back the hell off!

01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.372
Take that gun off him.
Take that gun off him!

01:15:51.416 --> 01:15:53.984
Charlie... where is it?

01:15:54.941 --> 01:15:57.944
Let me talk to my son,
and I'll take you to it.

01:15:57.988 --> 01:15:59.119
Take me where?

01:15:59.729 --> 01:16:00.947
First, let him go.

01:16:01.687 --> 01:16:03.428
Please, Anton.

01:16:15.919 --> 01:16:16.963
You all right?

01:16:18.748 --> 01:16:20.924
I gotta take them there.
I need you to stay here.

01:16:20.967 --> 01:16:22.926
-I'm not staying.
I wanna go with you.
-No!

01:16:23.230 --> 01:16:25.885
No. You need to stay here.
I can't have you going with us.

01:16:25.929 --> 01:16:28.888
-They're gonna kill you.
-No, they're not. I promise.

01:16:28.932 --> 01:16:30.977
I'm going to give them
the painting, and it's over.

01:16:31.499 --> 01:16:33.066
You can't be serious?

01:16:33.110 --> 01:16:35.416
-You want to leave your kid--
-He'll be fine.

01:16:37.723 --> 01:16:39.551
Remember when we got stuck
in the desert?

01:16:39.595 --> 01:16:40.900
When we broke down,

01:16:41.597 --> 01:16:42.946
you tried to fix it?

01:16:45.992 --> 01:16:47.733
Yeah. I remember.

01:16:49.517 --> 01:16:50.823
But what about you?

01:16:52.782 --> 01:16:54.174
- Charlie.
-Don't worry.

01:16:54.218 --> 01:16:55.698
Let's get it done.

01:16:55.741 --> 01:16:57.308
You drive the car.

01:16:58.831 --> 01:16:59.702
Move!

01:17:07.318 --> 01:17:08.449
Enjoy the sun, kid.

01:17:09.712 --> 01:17:11.017
You could use a tan.

01:18:17.083 --> 01:18:18.694
How far are we going?

01:18:19.825 --> 01:18:22.132
Just a little bit further.
Relax.

01:18:44.197 --> 01:18:46.286
Why are we taking
this dirt road?

01:18:48.027 --> 01:18:49.812
He asked you
a question, Charlie.

01:19:44.257 --> 01:19:45.563
Drive carefully.

01:19:57.183 --> 01:19:58.315
You okay?

01:19:59.011 --> 01:19:59.882
I'm fine.

01:20:00.970 --> 01:20:02.101
Are you hungry?

01:20:06.192 --> 01:20:08.020
Leo? Leo?

01:20:09.935 --> 01:20:11.981
You left your book bag
in the house.

01:20:14.897 --> 01:20:15.811
Okay.
