WEBVTT

00:01.835 --> 00:03.920
{\an1}So, it sounds like
you got Lauren situated.

00:04.003 --> 00:04.921
{\an3}Situated.

00:05.004 --> 00:06.756
Yeah, that's what she is.

00:06.840 --> 00:08.758
{\an1}I meant, uh, sounds
like she's doing okay.

00:08.842 --> 00:11.886
I know, and she is.

00:11.970 --> 00:15.140
{\an3}(sighs) You know, you were
really great with her.

00:15.223 --> 00:18.309
You were understanding and kind.

00:18.393 --> 00:20.603
I just did what
anybody would do.

00:20.687 --> 00:22.313
Well, not just anyone
would go to Mexico.

00:22.397 --> 00:24.232
Seriously, what you
and Dylan did-- I just, uh...

00:24.315 --> 00:25.442
We didn't do anything.

00:25.525 --> 00:28.111
Nothing that any friend
wouldn't do

00:28.194 --> 00:29.654
for another friend, that is.

00:29.738 --> 00:31.072
Kelly, you could've
been arrested.

00:31.156 --> 00:33.283
We weren't, so end of story.

00:33.366 --> 00:34.951
Gratitude accepted.

00:35.034 --> 00:36.953
(chuckling)

00:37.036 --> 00:38.955
{\an3}You are so modest,
you know that?

00:39.038 --> 00:40.373
And funny and...

00:42.041 --> 00:44.586
And I think about you a lot.

00:46.379 --> 00:47.797
I think about you, too.

00:49.090 --> 00:54.095
If you need more time,
I totally understand.

00:54.179 --> 00:56.389
You know what
I don't understand?

00:58.141 --> 00:59.642
How could you possibly
be so good?

00:59.726 --> 01:02.228
Believe me, I'm not.

01:05.648 --> 01:07.025
Criminal mismanagement?

01:07.108 --> 01:10.320
{\an3}That's just what
my lawyer called it.

01:10.403 --> 01:12.989
The lawyer she spoke to
as a friend.

01:13.072 --> 01:14.783
No one's been hired yet
or anything.

01:14.866 --> 01:20.163
Aunt Felice, there was
75,000 in there before,

01:20.246 --> 01:21.998
{\an3}and now there's
less than 15.

01:22.081 --> 01:24.834
You were the trustee, so who
do you think I should blame?

01:24.918 --> 01:26.336
{\an3}Your mother asked
for the money.

01:26.419 --> 01:28.046
{\an3}She said it was
for expenses.

01:28.129 --> 01:29.047
{\an3}For what?

01:29.130 --> 01:30.507
New master bath,
shag carpeting?

01:30.590 --> 01:32.175
How was I supposed
to know that?

01:32.258 --> 01:33.176
You could've asked.

01:33.259 --> 01:35.637
You would've if you cared.

01:41.226 --> 01:44.145
{\an1}Now, see what
you've gone and done?

01:44.229 --> 01:46.523
Like I was the one who ordered
the shag carpeting.

01:46.606 --> 01:47.524
You know what?

01:47.607 --> 01:50.151
We were supposed
to be working things out here.

01:55.949 --> 01:59.202
Noah, did you see Gina?

01:59.285 --> 02:01.037
Yeah, she just peeled out.

02:01.120 --> 02:02.705
What's going on?

02:02.789 --> 02:04.040
{\an1}(sighs) She's upset
about my mother,

02:04.123 --> 02:06.668
and she's gonna sue her.

02:06.751 --> 02:08.044
{\an3}You okay?

02:08.127 --> 02:08.919
No.

02:09.002 --> 02:11.673
I feel like I'm stuck
in the middle,

02:11.756 --> 02:14.759
and it's a really
difficult place to be.

02:14.843 --> 02:18.054
Here I have family
on both sides, and...

02:18.137 --> 02:20.181
and yet I feel completely alone.

02:20.265 --> 02:21.975
You don't have to be.

02:22.058 --> 02:23.434
Okay?

02:42.954 --> 02:44.873
(sighs)

02:44.956 --> 02:46.499
I should go talk to him.

02:46.583 --> 02:48.126
Okay.

02:56.509 --> 02:58.887
{\an1}Save it, all right?
I see what's going on.

02:58.970 --> 03:00.430
You made your choice.

03:00.513 --> 03:01.890
Live with it.

03:01.973 --> 03:02.974
(slamming)

03:17.030 --> 03:18.197
Whoo-hoo!

03:22.076 --> 03:23.745
Yee-haw!

03:26.080 --> 03:28.124
(grunts)

03:32.170 --> 03:35.298
Dude, what's your problem?

03:35.381 --> 03:37.592
Hey, I got no problems, man.

03:39.052 --> 03:40.637
Come on, I'll race you
to the pier.

03:40.720 --> 03:43.806
All right, you're on.

03:44.724 --> 03:46.392
Whoo-ha!

03:55.068 --> 03:56.319
Yeah, come on, baby!

03:56.402 --> 03:57.528
(laughing)

04:02.659 --> 04:04.035
Yee-haw!

04:05.745 --> 04:07.163
Whoo!

04:07.246 --> 04:09.165
(cackling)

04:11.250 --> 04:13.044
Come on, baby! Yeah!

Hey!

06:38.606 --> 06:40.650
(groaning)

06:54.330 --> 06:56.791
You and Noah looked
awfully cozy this morning.

06:56.874 --> 06:57.959
Are you guys back together?

06:58.042 --> 06:59.794
{\an3}Well, we were never
officially apart.

06:59.877 --> 07:02.630
A fact that seems to have
escaped David's notice.

07:02.713 --> 07:05.007
Well, going on a date with him

07:05.091 --> 07:06.050
might have given him
mixed signals.

07:06.134 --> 07:08.803
Unlike the door he slammed
in my face this morning.

07:08.886 --> 07:10.805
Well, I'm sure you guys
will work it out.

07:10.888 --> 07:12.014
You always do.

07:12.098 --> 07:13.349
Like you and Dylan?

07:13.432 --> 07:16.018
Did something happen?at.

07:16.102 --> 07:17.812
Did you guys not get along
in Mexico?

07:17.895 --> 07:19.147
Something like that, yeah.

07:20.565 --> 07:23.442
Hi, uh, listen,

07:23.526 --> 07:25.820
I've been thinking a lot,

07:25.903 --> 07:28.322
and I've kind of
come to a decision.

07:28.406 --> 07:30.825
I'm not gonna sue your mother
for $60,000.

07:30.908 --> 07:33.161
Well, that's good news.

07:33.244 --> 07:35.163
I'm gonna sue her
for $1.1 million.

07:35.246 --> 07:36.747
Very funny.

07:36.831 --> 07:37.999
Donna, it's for pain
and suffering.

07:38.082 --> 07:39.000
Are you kidding?

07:39.083 --> 07:40.334
No, I'm not.

07:40.418 --> 07:41.377
{\an3}Listen, I understand
if you're upset.

07:41.460 --> 07:42.378
I mean, she's your mother.

07:42.461 --> 07:44.172
Upset, Gina?

07:44.255 --> 07:45.381
We're family.

07:45.464 --> 07:47.842
You know, when no one
looks out for you,

07:47.925 --> 07:49.719
you have to look out
for yourself.

07:49.802 --> 07:51.095
No, no, no, no, you came here.

07:51.179 --> 07:52.388
I introduced you to my friends.

07:52.471 --> 07:53.848
I gave you a place to stay.

07:53.931 --> 07:55.099
I'm very grateful for that.

07:55.183 --> 07:57.101
You have a hell of a way
of showing it.

07:59.103 --> 08:01.063
{\an1}Do you realize how
insensitive you're being?

08:01.147 --> 08:02.565
Oh, please, Kelly,
this coming from a woman

08:02.648 --> 08:03.816
who doesn't even
have the decency

08:03.900 --> 08:05.109
to let Lauren's side
of the bed get cold?

08:05.193 --> 08:07.820
That's not a very nice
thing to say.

08:07.904 --> 08:09.197
You know, I was really worried

08:09.280 --> 08:10.907
about you and Dylan
in Mexico together.

08:10.990 --> 08:12.658
But obviously
you're still after Matt.

08:23.252 --> 08:26.464
{\an1}Matt, the kid who bought
the drugs ID'd your client.

08:26.547 --> 08:27.924
He said she was the dealer.

08:28.007 --> 08:30.092
We're talking about
a straight A student here

08:30.176 --> 08:31.302
with no criminal record.

08:31.385 --> 08:32.595
What was she doing
in Beverly Hills?

08:32.678 --> 08:34.096
Using the public library.

08:34.179 --> 08:36.097
The kind the public in her
neighborhood doesn't have.

08:36.182 --> 08:38.808
{\an3}Jay, she walks by
minding her own business.

08:38.893 --> 08:40.436
These two white kids
are doing the deal.

08:40.519 --> 08:41.729
{\an3}All right, the buyer
gets busted,

08:41.812 --> 08:42.730
points the finger at her.

08:42.813 --> 08:44.065
Why, if she's innocent?

08:44.148 --> 08:45.608
{\an3}There could be
a number of reasons.

08:45.691 --> 08:46.692
Maybe the dealer's a friend.

08:46.776 --> 08:48.778
Maybe, maybe he doesn't want
to lose his connection.

08:48.861 --> 08:49.779
But he knows it's gonna fly

08:49.862 --> 08:52.198
{\an3}because she's the only
African American around.

08:53.533 --> 08:54.909
Your client should think about

08:54.992 --> 08:57.995
{\an1}pleading guilty and getting
the best deal she can.

09:02.500 --> 09:03.668
What did he say?

09:03.751 --> 09:05.628
He wants to cut a deal.

09:05.711 --> 09:07.964
What kind of a deal?

09:08.047 --> 09:09.131
It's your first offense.

09:09.215 --> 09:10.132
If you plead guilty,

09:10.216 --> 09:11.968
you may not even be
looking at jail time.

09:12.051 --> 09:13.803
No, I'd rather
go to jail

09:13.886 --> 09:14.971
than plead guilty
for selling drugs.

09:15.054 --> 09:16.806
They've got a witness.

09:16.889 --> 09:19.433
{\an1}She is not pleading guilty
under any circumstances.

09:19.517 --> 09:20.476
Why not?

09:20.559 --> 09:21.894
Because I didn't do it.

09:25.064 --> 09:27.525
All right.

09:27.608 --> 09:29.860
(knocking on door)

09:32.071 --> 09:34.073
Oh, come here.

09:40.037 --> 09:41.998
{\an1}You know, I would not
have been able to do that

09:42.081 --> 09:44.333
{\an1}if some guy hadn't
saved my life today.

09:44.417 --> 09:45.668
What are you talking about?

09:45.751 --> 09:47.503
{\an1}A total stranger
jumps in the water,

09:47.586 --> 09:49.463
{\an1}pulls me out,
I didn't, you know...

09:49.547 --> 09:51.007
{\an3}What, uh...
Are you okay?

09:51.090 --> 09:53.342
Yeah, but I... I didn't get
a chance to talk to him.

09:53.426 --> 09:57.346
{\an3}So, I, uh, you know,
gotta find him.

09:57.430 --> 09:59.974
Oh, um, this thing
with your mother,

10:00.057 --> 10:01.976
you need help with that?

10:02.059 --> 10:03.311
Uh, no.

10:03.394 --> 10:04.312
You're sure?

10:04.395 --> 10:05.730
Yeah, actually I'd kind of

10:05.813 --> 10:07.148
like to keep that
separate from us.

10:07.231 --> 10:08.232
Why is that?

10:08.316 --> 10:09.442
Uh, I don't know, um,

10:09.525 --> 10:11.485
if you're gonna go look for
that guy, I could come with.

10:11.569 --> 10:13.988
No, I kind of just
want to talk to him.

10:14.071 --> 10:17.033
Yeah, I'll stay out of your way
and you stay out of mine.

10:17.116 --> 10:18.326
Not the way I want it.

10:18.409 --> 10:20.870
Just, uh, just the way it is.

10:22.163 --> 10:23.998
{\an1}Perfect.

10:24.081 --> 10:26.375
{\an5}JANET:
Have you seen a manila envelope
addressed to the printer?

10:26.459 --> 10:28.627
{\an3}Would that be the envelope
with the $3,000 check

10:28.711 --> 10:29.712
in it for the printer?

10:29.795 --> 10:30.588
Yeah, that's the one.

10:30.671 --> 10:32.673
{\an3}Yeah, well, I...
I ripped that check up.

10:32.757 --> 10:34.842
I reallocated the funds.

10:34.925 --> 10:36.844
Yeah.ocated?

10:36.927 --> 10:38.846
I used the money to pay
a prostitute last night.

10:38.929 --> 10:41.015
Oh, well, I hope
it was worth it.

10:41.098 --> 10:42.099
{\an3}OAnd, uh,

10:42.183 --> 10:44.894
by the way, I never want
to see your face ever again.

10:44.977 --> 10:46.937
Uh, no, Janet...

10:47.021 --> 10:48.731
she sold me this.

10:48.814 --> 10:51.233
It's the black book
to the Madam of the Stars.

10:51.317 --> 10:52.568
{\an1}She stole it
from her boss.

10:52.651 --> 10:54.070
She was in quite a hurry

10:54.153 --> 10:55.571
to get out of town
last night, too.

10:55.654 --> 10:56.697
Well, why'd she come to you?

10:56.781 --> 10:57.782
She reads our paper.

10:57.865 --> 10:59.700
Look at this. endorsement.

10:59.784 --> 11:02.703
It reads like a who's who
of Hollywood movie stars,

11:02.787 --> 11:05.122
power brokers,
super agents...

11:05.206 --> 11:07.124
Wow. That guy uses a prostitute?

11:07.208 --> 11:08.959
Why? He's so young

11:09.043 --> 11:11.087
and super famous.
Why would he need a prostitute?

11:11.170 --> 11:12.922
My favorite are the
closet philanderers.

11:13.005 --> 11:15.925
Those holier-than-thou,
squeaky-clean family men like

11:16.008 --> 11:18.427
famous talk show host
Mark Chapel.

11:18.511 --> 11:19.595
Do you know what would happen

11:19.678 --> 11:20.971
if we ran an article based
on this book?

11:21.055 --> 11:23.599
Yeah, circulation would triple.

11:23.682 --> 11:25.935
Ah. lawsuits would bankrupt us.

11:27.645 --> 11:32.441
His name is Patrick Ferrall--
two Rs, two Ls.

11:32.525 --> 11:34.068
Right. Uh, am I...?

11:34.151 --> 11:35.444
Yeah, I'm pretty sure.

11:35.528 --> 11:38.614
I got the bracelet
right here in my hand.

11:38.697 --> 11:40.950
Anyway, that is...
that's not possible,

11:41.033 --> 11:43.077
because I saw him today.

11:45.246 --> 11:48.791
You're, you're telling me
he died in December?

11:48.874 --> 11:50.793
(knocking)

11:50.876 --> 11:52.878
I'll get back to you.

11:54.713 --> 11:56.173
Oh..

11:56.257 --> 11:57.466
Am I interrupting?

11:57.550 --> 11:58.968
No.

11:59.051 --> 12:01.137
{\an1}I'm just, uh, trying
to find somebody

12:01.220 --> 12:02.930
{\an1}that doesn't want
to be found.

12:03.013 --> 12:04.140
{\an3}Well, then,
do him a favor.

12:04.223 --> 12:05.433
Don't try too hard.

12:05.516 --> 12:06.809
Well, I have to.

12:06.892 --> 12:08.227
{\an1}He, uh, did something
I appreciate,

12:08.310 --> 12:09.812
and I want to thank him.

12:09.895 --> 12:13.149
Yeah, well, we did something
that Matt appreciates.

12:13.232 --> 12:15.651
He's very grateful.

12:15.734 --> 12:17.862
Hmm. So was I.

12:17.945 --> 12:21.323
The more he thanks me,
the guiltier I feel.

12:21.407 --> 12:23.033
Oh, come on.

12:23.117 --> 12:26.829
Uh, what's it gonna be--
beer or... beer?

12:26.912 --> 12:29.582
Did I cheat on Matt?

12:33.752 --> 12:36.172
The guy was with his wife, Kel.

12:36.255 --> 12:38.007
Yeah, but...

12:38.090 --> 12:39.842
{\an3}I knew that that
relationship was gonna end,

12:39.925 --> 12:41.677
one way or another.

12:41.760 --> 12:43.053
Do you have another choice,

12:43.137 --> 12:45.973
or must you overthink
everything?

12:46.056 --> 12:48.851
{\an3}It doesn't bother you,
cheating on Gina?

12:48.934 --> 12:50.895
Uh, not particularly, no.

12:50.978 --> 12:53.647
See, I don't understand that.

12:53.731 --> 12:55.900
Oh, it's, uh...
it's what we do.

12:55.983 --> 12:56.859
Me and you.

12:56.942 --> 12:58.360
With Brenda.

12:58.444 --> 13:00.321
You know, on Brandon.

13:00.404 --> 13:01.989
And now Matt.

13:02.072 --> 13:03.991
Mm-hmm.

13:04.074 --> 13:05.993
It's who we are.

13:06.076 --> 13:07.578
This is different.

13:07.661 --> 13:10.498
He's different.

13:10.581 --> 13:11.999
I love him.

13:12.082 --> 13:13.918
I'm sure that you do.

13:15.252 --> 13:16.921
I'm also sure that someday

13:17.004 --> 13:20.424
you're gonna want to be
with me again.

13:28.599 --> 13:30.601
(rock music playing)

13:31.602 --> 13:33.020
(knocking)

13:33.103 --> 13:34.230
Yeah?

13:34.313 --> 13:35.606
(door opening)

13:35.689 --> 13:37.066
One minute.

13:37.149 --> 13:38.609
Just hear me out.

13:38.692 --> 13:39.902
Song's almost over.

13:39.985 --> 13:41.070
Talk fast.

13:41.153 --> 13:42.905
Well, I told you
I wasn't over Noah.

13:42.988 --> 13:45.282
Big difference between
not being over someone

13:45.366 --> 13:47.201
and being with them, Donna.

13:47.284 --> 13:48.619
Come on, we're not gonna really

13:48.702 --> 13:50.246
let this ruin our friendship,
are we?

13:53.999 --> 13:55.417
No.

13:55.501 --> 13:58.504
Besides, you didn't
really want me.

13:58.587 --> 13:59.797
You wanted what we had.

13:59.880 --> 14:02.341
I still do.

14:02.424 --> 14:04.802
Well, you're gonna find
someone else.

14:04.885 --> 14:06.845
Lately, my love life
has been pretty pitiful.

14:06.929 --> 14:09.932
{\an1}Well, maybe you expect
too much too fast.

14:10.015 --> 14:12.935
Oh, so what you're saying,
I should lower my expectations?

14:13.018 --> 14:15.062
{\an1}No, just change it up
a little bit.

14:15.145 --> 14:15.896
{\an1}You know, expand
your horizons.

14:15.980 --> 14:17.940
{\an1}Get out of this booth
once in a while.

14:18.023 --> 14:19.066
Are you kidding me?

14:19.149 --> 14:22.778
This booth is the only thing
I have going right now.

14:22.861 --> 14:24.405
No. You know what?

14:24.488 --> 14:26.115
You... you're absolutely right.

14:26.198 --> 14:27.783
You should stay right here,

14:27.866 --> 14:30.411
and you should
let them come to you.

14:30.494 --> 14:31.620
What are you talking about?

14:31.704 --> 14:33.664
Well, you have
a very big audience,

14:33.747 --> 14:35.124
and most of them are women.

14:35.207 --> 14:36.458
The last time

14:36.542 --> 14:39.295
I got together with a call-in,
she was 17.

14:39.378 --> 14:41.922
Yeah, yeah, well, you know,
this time you'll ask for ID.

14:42.006 --> 14:43.799
No, no, I can't.

14:43.882 --> 14:46.135
Come on, take a chance.

14:46.218 --> 14:47.803
The song's ending.

14:47.886 --> 14:50.264
There's a new high in lows.

14:53.726 --> 14:55.102
I have a challenge

14:55.185 --> 14:58.480
to all eligible women.

14:58.564 --> 15:01.483
I'm convinced there's no one
out there for me,

15:01.567 --> 15:04.320
so... prove me wrong.

15:04.403 --> 15:07.656
Give me a call,
write me a letter, send me

15:07.740 --> 15:09.658
a picture.

15:09.742 --> 15:11.785
I dare you.

15:13.245 --> 15:18.000
(rock music playing)

15:18.083 --> 15:19.918
This is never gonna work.

15:20.002 --> 15:21.253
(Donna laughs)

15:35.476 --> 15:37.019
{\an1}DYLAN:
Look, Doctor, I have talked

15:37.102 --> 15:39.021
to every administrator here,

15:39.104 --> 15:41.190
{\an1}and the only thing
they will tell me is

15:41.273 --> 15:42.900
that you were Patrick Ferrall's
attending.

15:42.983 --> 15:45.027
{\an3}Yes, that was
three months ago.

15:45.110 --> 15:47.363
{\an1}Yeah, but it says
Patrick Ferrall right here

15:47.446 --> 15:49.198
{\an1}on this bracelet
from this hospital.

15:49.281 --> 15:50.699
Now, if he is dead,

15:50.783 --> 15:52.701
{\an1}there's got to be some kind
of connection.

15:52.785 --> 15:57.039
{\an3}Mr. McKay, I-I just
had 18 hours on call.

15:57.122 --> 15:58.040
{\an1}All right.

15:58.123 --> 15:59.375
Oh, watch out.

15:59.458 --> 16:00.709
Oh. Oh, that's great.

16:00.793 --> 16:02.169
That's great.

16:02.252 --> 16:03.671
{\an3}Now, the state--
they-they spend thousands

16:03.754 --> 16:05.214
of dollars on light fixtures,

16:05.297 --> 16:08.717
and they can't spare a dime
to fix a lousy playground.

16:08.801 --> 16:10.552
Oh, yeah. Listen, he...

16:10.636 --> 16:12.554
{\an1}This guy was in, you know,
his mid-twenties

16:12.638 --> 16:15.057
uh, brown hair.

16:15.140 --> 16:17.059
He was maybe my height. I...

16:17.142 --> 16:20.062
{\an3}Patrick Ferrall was seven
years old, brown hair.

16:20.145 --> 16:21.897
{\an1}Oh, this kid was definitely
not seven years old.

16:21.980 --> 16:24.024
{\an1}I mean, he jumped
in the water, saved my life.

16:24.108 --> 16:27.152
{\an1}He was wearing this,
and it says Patrick Ferrall.

16:30.114 --> 16:31.365
You know what?

16:31.448 --> 16:33.242
Patrick had an older brother.

16:33.325 --> 16:34.535
He kept a vigil here.

16:34.618 --> 16:36.620
{\an3}He-he never left
his side and he...

16:36.704 --> 16:38.247
never gave up hope.

16:38.330 --> 16:40.249
{\an3}I remember when
Patrick died, it was...

16:40.332 --> 16:42.167
Ugh! It was hard.

16:42.251 --> 16:43.210
It really hit him hard.

16:43.293 --> 16:47.381
{\an3}Maybe he kept
his brother's tag.

16:47.464 --> 16:48.924
Must, uh...

16:49.007 --> 16:51.260
{\an1}test your faith,
working here, huh?

16:51.343 --> 16:53.887
{\an3}I wonder when we
learned to give up.

16:53.971 --> 16:57.099
{\an3}Because these kids--
they never do.

16:57.182 --> 16:58.559
Tell you what.

16:58.642 --> 17:02.062
I think his brother's
name is Tim Ferrall.

17:02.146 --> 17:05.148
{\an3}Tim. And he lives
in Simi Valley.

17:06.191 --> 17:07.568
Good luck.

17:07.651 --> 17:09.153
Thank you.

17:13.156 --> 17:14.992
Hmm.

17:19.204 --> 17:20.580
{\an1}Hey.

17:20.664 --> 17:21.832
Hey. How you doing?

17:21.915 --> 17:23.250
Wow. That looks heavy.

17:23.333 --> 17:24.626
{\an3}Yeah.

17:24.710 --> 17:26.127
Um, yesterday--

17:26.211 --> 17:29.923
{\an3}us together-- did that
feel awkward to you?

17:30.007 --> 17:31.759
Matt, we have plenty of time.

17:31.842 --> 17:34.178
{\an1}There's no need
to rush anything.

17:34.261 --> 17:36.138
Yeah, you keep saying.

17:36.221 --> 17:37.931
Um, look, tomorrow night,

17:38.015 --> 17:40.142
I want to take you and
Dylan out for dinner.

17:40.225 --> 17:41.727
My way of saying thank you.

17:41.810 --> 17:43.520
You've already done that.

17:43.604 --> 17:45.564
Indulge me.

17:45.647 --> 17:48.317
{\an1}I'm sure that
Dylan won't be able to go.

17:48.400 --> 17:49.651
{\an3}I already checked.
He's free.

17:49.735 --> 17:51.195
Okay.

17:51.278 --> 17:52.529
Okay.

17:54.406 --> 17:55.949
{\an3}STEVE:
Ah, there you are.

17:56.033 --> 17:57.034
You guys are here early.

17:57.117 --> 17:58.702
{\an3}Well, what's the
verdict? Can we print

17:58.786 --> 18:00.662
the information we found
in the black book or not?

18:00.746 --> 18:01.789
Well, here's the deal.

18:01.872 --> 18:04.166
You can't be sued for libel
if what you print is true.

18:04.249 --> 18:05.209
Yes. What did I tell you?

18:05.292 --> 18:06.668
So, where's this infamous

18:06.752 --> 18:08.212
{\an1}black book I've heard
so much about?

18:08.295 --> 18:09.463
(sniffing)

18:09.546 --> 18:10.714
Mmm! Lightning in a bottle.

18:10.798 --> 18:11.965
{\an1}(chuckling):
All right.

18:12.049 --> 18:13.258
Thank you.self.

18:13.342 --> 18:15.677
Could you, uh...?

18:15.761 --> 18:17.179
{\an1}Thanks.

18:17.262 --> 18:18.222
You got it?

18:18.305 --> 18:22.059
{\an1}Now, you just have to be able
to back up every word

18:22.142 --> 18:24.353
{\an1}you write with, um,
proof of its accuracy.

18:24.436 --> 18:26.230
{\an3}Uh, that's not a problem.
Check this out.

18:26.313 --> 18:27.523
(laughs)

18:27.606 --> 18:29.024
Yeah, you weren't kidding.

18:29.107 --> 18:31.151
There are some very,
very interesting names in here.

18:31.235 --> 18:33.195
{\an1}JANET: Well, how are you
supposed to prove that

18:33.278 --> 18:35.030
Mark Chapel's sleeping
with a prostitute?

18:35.114 --> 18:36.198
We tail him.

18:36.281 --> 18:37.533
{\an3}We follow him
everywhere he goes.

18:37.616 --> 18:38.700
It'll be fun.

18:38.784 --> 18:39.868
Are you in, Counselor?

18:39.952 --> 18:41.411
No, I'll sit this one out,

18:41.495 --> 18:43.038
but you mind if I hold on
to this for a while?

18:43.121 --> 18:44.373
Just want
to do a little more research.

18:44.456 --> 18:46.041
{\an3}Yeah, okay. Just
don't go selling that

18:46.125 --> 18:47.209
to any other tabloids.

18:47.292 --> 18:49.044
Yeah. Don't worry about that.

18:49.127 --> 18:50.128
Come on.

18:51.129 --> 18:52.214
Yes. Thanks.

18:52.297 --> 18:53.215
{\an1}JANET:
Oh. Got it?

18:53.298 --> 18:54.383
Okay. Thanks.

18:54.466 --> 18:55.384
{\an3}ComeBye.

18:55.467 --> 18:56.510
Thanks a lot.

19:00.138 --> 19:01.056
{\an3}Oh. Sorry.

19:01.139 --> 19:02.558
Yeah, you should be.

19:02.641 --> 19:03.851
{\an1}Whatever.

19:03.934 --> 19:06.937
Are you still planning on suing
my mother for a million dollars?

19:07.020 --> 19:08.564
{\an1}Actually, I'm suing her
for one million,

19:08.647 --> 19:09.857
$100,000.

19:09.940 --> 19:12.109
{\an3}You do know what you're
doing is so wrong.

19:12.192 --> 19:14.069
{\an1}You know, see, now,
that's not what you said

19:14.153 --> 19:16.071
when you told me to go after
the deep pockets, remember?

19:16.154 --> 19:17.281
Yeah, that's when I thought

19:17.364 --> 19:18.907
{\an3}it was some big
financial institution.

19:18.991 --> 19:20.617
Oh, what? And what, now,
because it's your mother?

19:20.701 --> 19:22.411
She's not some bank
or a financial whiz.

19:22.494 --> 19:24.079
{\an3}I'm sure she did
the best she could.

19:24.163 --> 19:25.163
How do you know that?

19:27.457 --> 19:29.585
Look, all I know

19:29.668 --> 19:32.588
{\an1}is that I used to
have a secure future,

19:32.671 --> 19:34.131
and now I don't

19:34.214 --> 19:35.883
because of your mother.

19:35.966 --> 19:38.260
(sighs)

19:38.343 --> 19:40.095
Listen, why don't...?

19:40.178 --> 19:42.097
{\an3}Why don't we all
go to dinner

19:42.180 --> 19:44.141
and at least try
to work this out?

19:47.019 --> 19:48.812
{\an1}Do you remember
when we were kids,

19:48.896 --> 19:51.106
{\an1}and I came to visit you
that summer?

19:51.189 --> 19:54.192
{\an1}And the neighbor
made fun of me

19:54.276 --> 19:56.069
{\an1}because I was wearing
your hand-me-downs?

19:56.153 --> 19:57.738
Yeah, I remember that.

19:57.821 --> 19:59.781
And you stood up for me.

20:04.494 --> 20:06.330
Why can't you do that now?

20:15.714 --> 20:18.091
Jay, wait up.

20:18.175 --> 20:20.260
{\an1}I, uh... I got
a question for you.

20:20.344 --> 20:21.428
{\an3}Is it about the
Barret case?

20:21.511 --> 20:23.764
No. A, uh, journalist
I know got his hands

20:23.847 --> 20:24.765
on a madam's black book,

20:24.848 --> 20:27.267
{\an1}and one of the names in it
is heavily political.

20:27.351 --> 20:28.268
No kidding? Who is it?

20:28.352 --> 20:30.437
Yeah. Well...

20:30.520 --> 20:31.939
A young guy, but I hear

20:32.022 --> 20:33.941
{\an1}he's already
positioning himself for D.A.

20:34.024 --> 20:36.693
Yup. a friend of mine.

20:36.777 --> 20:37.736
They say the guys who like

20:37.819 --> 20:39.821
{\an1}to give orders all day
like to take them at night.

20:39.905 --> 20:43.158
{\an1}Check out the notes
right there. Oh!

20:43.241 --> 20:44.701
Anybody can write
a name in a book.

20:44.785 --> 20:47.037
{\an1}Yeah, and anyone can point
a finger in a drug bust.

20:47.120 --> 20:49.039
{\an1}Linda Barret could have taken
a plea with no jail time,

20:49.122 --> 20:50.040
but she's willing
to roll the dice,

20:50.123 --> 20:51.959
because she's innocent.

20:52.042 --> 20:54.836
She's not the only one
willing to take a risk.

20:54.920 --> 20:58.256
{\an3}You just blackmailed
a deputy district attorney.

21:06.473 --> 21:08.517
(rock music playing)

21:18.735 --> 21:20.153
Look, we're gonna have
to work together,

21:20.237 --> 21:21.363
so we're gonna have
to deal, okay?

21:21.446 --> 21:23.198
{\an3}I'm the one
that has to deal

21:23.281 --> 21:24.366
with you and Donna
being together.

21:24.449 --> 21:26.034
{\an1}Yeah? You got a problem
with that?

21:26.118 --> 21:27.327
Those for me?

21:27.411 --> 21:30.163
Claudia from the cleaning crew
found them out by the back door.

21:30.247 --> 21:33.542
Oh.

21:33.625 --> 21:34.876
(sniffing)

21:34.960 --> 21:36.169
(laughs)

21:36.253 --> 21:37.713
It smells like cotton candy.

21:37.796 --> 21:40.215
(sniffing)

21:40.298 --> 21:42.259
Nice. Bodes well.

21:43.427 --> 21:46.179
{\an1}Look, uh,
good luck tonight.

21:46.263 --> 21:47.681
{\an1}I mean it.

21:47.764 --> 21:49.099
Thanks.

21:49.182 --> 21:51.351
I'm sure you do.

21:53.937 --> 21:55.063
This is KVIB.

21:55.147 --> 21:56.732
You're on the line
with David Silver.

21:56.815 --> 21:58.108
WOMAN (on phone):
You have some nerve.

21:58.191 --> 21:59.067
What makes you think

21:59.151 --> 22:01.278
you're so special
you can pick and choose

22:01.361 --> 22:03.071
between so many women?

22:03.155 --> 22:03.989
If I were so special,

22:04.072 --> 22:06.575
you really think
I'd need to be doing this?

22:06.658 --> 22:08.076
(chuckles)
Well, I'll say this for you:

22:08.160 --> 22:09.578
At least you're honest.

22:09.661 --> 22:11.204
(laughing):
Yeah, so are you.

22:11.288 --> 22:12.581
You're the first person
to call me

22:12.664 --> 22:14.791
on how ridiculous
this whole thing is.

22:14.875 --> 22:16.251
It's not as bad as being alone

22:16.334 --> 22:19.921
when all your friends
are hooked up and in love.

22:20.005 --> 22:21.089
You always this direct?

22:21.173 --> 22:23.091
Always.

22:23.175 --> 22:25.052
That's a great accent.
Where are you from?

22:25.135 --> 22:28.764
Caracas, Venezuela.

22:28.847 --> 22:30.766
Hold on, all right,
we'll talk off the air.

22:30.849 --> 22:34.061
I'll get your,
uh, name and number, you know.

22:34.144 --> 22:35.687
Just hold on.

22:37.439 --> 22:40.150
(Latin music playing)

22:41.193 --> 22:43.403
Hello?

22:43.487 --> 22:45.489
(dial tHello?oning)

22:47.657 --> 22:48.825
Hello?

22:55.165 --> 22:57.000
What a day I've had.

22:57.084 --> 22:59.377
{\an3}Three hours
at Lieberg and White.

22:59.461 --> 23:01.505
{\an3}I'm sure you've heard
of them, Gina.

23:01.588 --> 23:03.173
Ranked in the top ten
law firms in L.A.

23:03.256 --> 23:05.592
Oh, actually, no, I don't.

23:06.885 --> 23:09.304
Are you trying to intimidate me,
Aunt Felice?

23:09.387 --> 23:10.889
Intimidate you?

23:10.972 --> 23:13.433
{\an3}My beloved niece
who's suing me

23:13.517 --> 23:15.602
for a million dollars?

23:15.685 --> 23:17.938
Perish thMom, stop.

23:18.021 --> 23:19.689
I have to admit they did say
that your case

23:19.773 --> 23:21.650
doesn't stand a chance in court.

23:26.279 --> 23:28.698
{\an3}Bobbi, do you have to keep
rummaging through that

23:28.782 --> 23:30.200
ghastly bag of yours?

23:30.283 --> 23:32.244
Well, I'm just looking
for my cigarettes.

23:32.327 --> 23:33.703
Mom, you can't smoke in here.

23:33.787 --> 23:36.748
Yeah, in L.A., you can't smoke
in any restaurant.

23:36.832 --> 23:37.624
Gotta have a smoke.

23:40.961 --> 23:43.505
The woman has absolutely
no self-control.

23:43.588 --> 23:46.007
Never has. Never will.

23:50.345 --> 23:52.222
(hammering)

23:57.269 --> 23:58.645
{\an3}Hey.

23:59.980 --> 24:04.693
If you came to say thank you,
you're welcome.

24:04.776 --> 24:06.695
Don't mention it, my pleasure.

24:06.778 --> 24:11.366
Whatever my life is,
you, uh, you saved it.

24:11.449 --> 24:12.993
No offense,

24:13.076 --> 24:14.870
but your life doesn't mean
a whole hell of a lot to me.

24:14.953 --> 24:17.873
Either way,

24:17.956 --> 24:21.209
I'm sorry for your loss.

24:21.293 --> 24:25.505
My parents can't even
look out here without crying.

24:27.090 --> 24:29.593
I let a seven year old kid
sit on my lap

24:29.676 --> 24:31.595
and drive the car
around the block.

24:31.678 --> 24:35.390
Some guy runs a red light,
barely taps us,

24:35.473 --> 24:38.560
airbag goes,
he dies three days later.

24:38.643 --> 24:40.061
You think it was fate,

24:40.145 --> 24:41.271
my saving you?

24:41.354 --> 24:45.901
Some cosmic favor that put me
out there just swimming by?

24:45.984 --> 24:47.903
Yeah. Yes, I do.

24:47.986 --> 24:50.071
The truth is,
before your accident,

24:50.155 --> 24:52.032
I decided to keep on swimming

24:52.115 --> 24:53.575
and not turn back.

24:53.658 --> 24:55.744
I was going to kill myself.

24:55.827 --> 24:58.914
Now what do you think of
Tim Ferrall, the big hero?

24:58.997 --> 25:01.374
I think if you really
wanted to die,

25:01.458 --> 25:03.960
you'd have gotten back
in the water.

25:04.044 --> 25:06.838
Night's still young.

25:16.890 --> 25:20.769
We're gonna nail this guy
for stepping out on his wife.

25:20.852 --> 25:21.978
We don't have any proof.

25:22.062 --> 25:24.272
Come on, he's in
the madam's book.

25:24.356 --> 25:26.524
{\an3}He snuck out
last night at 10:00.

25:26.608 --> 25:28.109
Went to a hotel room,

25:28.193 --> 25:30.445
then slithered back home
at 5:00 in the morning.

25:30.528 --> 25:31.780
What's that?

25:31.863 --> 25:33.448
{\an1}Yeah, but when he pulled
in the driveway,

25:33.531 --> 25:35.784
the light went on immediately.

25:35.867 --> 25:38.119
I mean, I don't understand why
she didn't just kick him out.

25:38.203 --> 25:39.412
Who cares about her?

25:39.496 --> 25:40.956
She's not news; he is.

25:41.039 --> 25:42.290
We're just gonna have to settle

25:42.374 --> 25:44.125
for a picture of him
coming out of the house.

25:44.209 --> 25:46.127
You know, we waited
all night at the hotel,

25:46.211 --> 25:48.505
and we didn't see anyone
go to or leave his room.

25:48.588 --> 25:51.466
Guy keeps a hotel room
full-time.

25:51.549 --> 25:53.301
Just because he didn't have
a prostitute last night

25:53.385 --> 25:54.636
doesn't make him a saint.

25:54.719 --> 25:56.137
I'm just saying, we don't know

25:56.221 --> 25:57.430
anything about his life.

25:58.348 --> 26:00.100
Okay, here we go.

26:03.061 --> 26:04.104
Oh, don't you dare
kiss him good-bye.

26:05.355 --> 26:06.481
She should take that knapsack

26:06.564 --> 26:07.774
to her husband's head.

26:07.857 --> 26:11.403
(chattering)

26:15.532 --> 26:17.659
You know what, I think
you're right, Janet.

26:17.742 --> 26:19.995
We don't know anything
about this guy's life.

26:20.078 --> 26:21.705
And we do now?

26:21.788 --> 26:26.001
You know, I'm thinking that
he keeps that hotel room

26:26.084 --> 26:29.379
because he doesn't
live here anymore.

26:29.462 --> 26:30.797
I bet they're separated.

26:30.880 --> 26:33.008
And they just haven't
broken it to the kids yet.

26:34.259 --> 26:35.427
Trust me on this one.

26:41.891 --> 26:43.184
DAVID:
Noah.

26:43.268 --> 26:45.186
{\an6}NOAH:
You giving Claudia
extra work?

26:45.270 --> 26:48.565
Hey, you can't wait for
the floors to dry, man?

26:48.648 --> 26:50.108
Sorry.

26:52.485 --> 26:56.573
{\an1}Uh, dude...
she's coming here.

26:56.656 --> 26:59.576
The girl I told you about.

26:59.659 --> 27:01.703
{\an3}So, one conversation,
you're sold?

27:01.786 --> 27:04.456
What can I say?

27:04.539 --> 27:06.124
I'm intuitive.

27:06.207 --> 27:08.543
{\an3}Thought she got
disconnected, man.

27:08.626 --> 27:10.587
{\an4}DAVID:
Yeah, well, she, uh,
she wrote me a letter.

27:10.670 --> 27:12.547
Banco de Chile stationary.

27:12.630 --> 27:14.466
{\an3}(cOh, yeah.

27:14.549 --> 27:15.884
I talked to her assistant.

27:15.967 --> 27:18.887
{\an3}I thought she was
in Venezuela.

27:18.970 --> 27:21.556
Yeah, it's the same continent.

27:21.639 --> 27:24.059
Yeah, and now she's
conquering this one.

27:24.142 --> 27:26.561
(knocking)

27:27.520 --> 27:29.189
Cecile?

27:30.357 --> 27:32.400
{\an1}DAVID:
David.

27:32.484 --> 27:34.736
I was afraid you...
you didn't get the message

27:34.819 --> 27:36.738
but well, here you are.

27:36.821 --> 27:39.407
{\an3}I'm sorry,

27:39.491 --> 27:40.533
this is Noah.

27:40.617 --> 27:42.577
Cecile. Nice to meet you.

27:42.660 --> 27:45.622
You don't have an accent.

27:46.790 --> 27:48.917
You were hoping
for someone else?

27:49.000 --> 27:51.753
Look, you're way more beautiful

27:51.836 --> 27:55.090
{\an3}than I expected
and great, I'm sure.

27:55.173 --> 27:56.800
But yeah, yeah, I was.

28:07.811 --> 28:11.606
{\an1}I'll, uh, never forget
what you did for Lauren.

28:11.689 --> 28:13.108
{\an3}Nothing.

28:13.191 --> 28:14.359
You know, I used to

28:14.442 --> 28:17.946
have a hard time with you two
spending so much time together.

28:18.029 --> 28:19.948
Well, that's because Kelly
follows her heart.

28:20.031 --> 28:22.659
No, I mean, it's just that,

28:22.742 --> 28:23.785
uh, she does whatever she wants.

28:23.868 --> 28:25.453
There's nothing you or I
can do about it.

28:25.537 --> 28:28.498
Okay.
Thank you for the bio.

28:28.581 --> 28:32.085
But Matt knows me
just about as well as you do.

28:32.168 --> 28:34.963
And he's just trying
to thank us.

28:35.046 --> 28:36.589
Thank us for what?

28:36.673 --> 28:37.632
She didn't even take the pills.

28:37.715 --> 28:39.008
Dylan...

28:39.092 --> 28:40.969
Unfortunately,
at the end of the day,

28:41.052 --> 28:43.012
we didn't help her any, Kel.

28:43.096 --> 28:45.098
So, you're saying neither did I?

28:45.181 --> 28:46.307
It's nobody's fault.

28:46.391 --> 28:47.684
And if I hadn't
tried to help her?

28:47.767 --> 28:48.977
Same result.

28:49.060 --> 28:51.604
Is this really so awful for you,

28:51.688 --> 28:54.441
admitting that you actually
care about someone or something?

28:54.524 --> 28:58.027
Hypothetical situation.

28:58.111 --> 28:59.946
The guy saves my life.

29:00.029 --> 29:02.615
Same guy wants to
end his own life.

29:02.699 --> 29:05.452
What are you talking about,
someone committing suicide?

29:05.535 --> 29:06.703
{\an3}And what?

29:06.786 --> 29:08.163
Me the, uh, all-powerful Oz,

29:08.246 --> 29:09.664
I'm supposed to get in there
and make a difference?

29:09.747 --> 29:11.666
Yeah, that would be
what one would do.

29:11.749 --> 29:12.667
No, Kel.

29:12.750 --> 29:15.295
If he really wanted to
off himself, he would.

29:15.378 --> 29:17.505
And if he didn't, he won't.

29:17.589 --> 29:19.174
Now, there's a theory
that'll get you

29:19.257 --> 29:20.592
through the day without trying.

29:20.675 --> 29:21.634
Or failing.

29:21.718 --> 29:23.470
Or is that
what you're afraid of?

29:23.553 --> 29:25.221
Hmm, activism in stereo.

29:25.305 --> 29:27.515
You two are perfect

29:27.599 --> 29:28.892
for each other.

29:36.149 --> 29:40.069
Is your, uh, cottage cheese
the large curd or the small?

29:40.153 --> 29:41.529
I haven't looked lately.

29:41.613 --> 29:44.073
Just water is fine.

29:44.157 --> 29:46.201
Okay.

29:47.827 --> 29:49.704
So, Mom,

29:49.787 --> 29:51.581
how come we never
visit your family?

29:51.664 --> 29:53.416
Isn't that clear?

29:53.500 --> 29:55.752
What, are you
embarrassed of them?

29:55.835 --> 29:57.545
Honey, look at Bobbi.

29:57.629 --> 29:59.714
She and I have absolutely
nothing in common anymore.

29:59.797 --> 30:00.715
Except Gina.

30:00.798 --> 30:02.717
Well, let me tell you
something about Gina.

30:02.800 --> 30:04.594
There are two kinds of
people in this world.

30:04.677 --> 30:06.095
The givers and the takers.

30:06.179 --> 30:08.556
And... that girl is a taker.

30:08.640 --> 30:13.061
Believe me, I know
exactly how Gina can be,

30:13.144 --> 30:15.563
but it's not all that she is.

30:15.647 --> 30:18.399
Well, sweetheart, that's because
you only see the good in people.

30:18.483 --> 30:21.903
No, I see the bad, too.

30:21.986 --> 30:24.322
And now I understand
how you feel about your family.

30:24.405 --> 30:27.075
That you would rather
turn your back on them

30:27.158 --> 30:28.576
than admit you made a mistake.

30:28.660 --> 30:30.578
Bobbi blew that money.

30:30.662 --> 30:32.580
I know.

30:32.664 --> 30:34.749
But your name was on the trust.

30:34.832 --> 30:36.793
Therefore, you had
a responsibility,

30:36.876 --> 30:38.211
and you ignored it.

30:38.294 --> 30:39.754
{\an1}You should give her
the 60,000.

30:39.837 --> 30:42.882
For the simple fact that
it's the right thing to do.

30:52.642 --> 30:54.769
{\an1}(giggling)

30:54.852 --> 30:56.104
How are Matt and Kelly?

30:56.187 --> 30:58.106
{\an3}(sighs)

30:58.189 --> 31:01.192
{\an3}Annoying.

31:01.276 --> 31:05.113
{\an6}(sighs)
It's a funny thing
about dying.

31:05.196 --> 31:07.949
I kind of always thought
I'd go kicking and screaming.

31:08.032 --> 31:10.285
Weren't you?

31:10.368 --> 31:12.287
No.

31:12.370 --> 31:14.622
{\an3}I mean, I felt like
I was choking.

31:14.706 --> 31:17.625
I couldn't really
tell up from down

31:17.709 --> 31:20.503
and then... nothing.

31:20.587 --> 31:23.006
You were losing consciousness.

31:23.089 --> 31:24.632
No.

31:24.716 --> 31:27.552
I was numb.

31:27.635 --> 31:29.137
I have been for months;

31:29.220 --> 31:30.555
I just go through the motions.

31:32.682 --> 31:34.601
You should stop.

31:34.684 --> 31:36.227
And do what?

31:36.311 --> 31:37.186
Figure out what you want.

31:37.270 --> 31:39.689
You should've been at dinner.

31:39.772 --> 31:42.775
Matt and Kelly were
full of easy solutions.

31:42.859 --> 31:45.278
Not you, though.

31:45.361 --> 31:46.779
You are a fighter.

31:46.863 --> 31:49.449
And what are you?

31:49.532 --> 31:52.118
I'm just somebody that
doesn't care very much.

31:52.201 --> 31:54.370
About anything.

31:59.375 --> 32:01.461
Present company excluded, right?

32:01.544 --> 32:06.299
I'm just saying that I know
how it is between us.

32:06.382 --> 32:08.384
I'm not proud of it.

32:08.468 --> 32:11.721
The fact that I'm still here...

32:11.804 --> 32:13.848
neither am I.

32:31.324 --> 32:32.909
You always get in this early?

32:32.992 --> 32:35.244
{\an3}Anytime the D.A.'s
office calls.

32:41.250 --> 32:43.336
Waiting on a friend coming in on
an early flight from New York.

32:43.419 --> 32:46.506
So, uh, what's up?

32:46.589 --> 32:48.341
You win.
I'm dropping the charges.

32:48.424 --> 32:50.343
Why?

32:50.426 --> 32:52.303
You know damn well why.

32:52.387 --> 32:54.389
What's the official story?

32:54.472 --> 32:56.599
Cops pushed the kid
at the library hard.

32:56.683 --> 32:57.850
Gave up his dealer.

32:57.934 --> 33:00.311
Caucasian, two priors.

33:00.395 --> 33:01.771
Nice.

33:01.854 --> 33:03.898
An innocent 17-year-old girl
would've gone to jail.

33:03.981 --> 33:05.400
The jury might've
decided otherwise.

33:05.483 --> 33:07.610
What can I say, I lost
my faith in happy endings.

33:07.694 --> 33:09.028
It's no excuse.

33:09.112 --> 33:10.613
What you did was unethical,

33:10.697 --> 33:11.906
not to mention illegal.

33:17.120 --> 33:19.247
What was he talking about?

33:19.330 --> 33:20.957
I lost Lauren. There wasn't a
damn thing I could do about it.

33:21.040 --> 33:22.250
I could save this client,

33:22.333 --> 33:23.209
and I was willing
to do anything it took.

33:25.253 --> 33:28.631
{\an1}Hi. I could get some coffee
if you need a minute.

33:28.715 --> 33:30.091
No. Come on in.

33:30.174 --> 33:31.634
It's good to see you.
I, uh...

33:31.718 --> 33:33.928
{\an1}Kelly, this is Anna Murphy
from New York.

33:34.011 --> 33:34.929
Hi.

33:35.012 --> 33:35.930
Nice to meet you.

33:36.013 --> 33:37.765
Lauren's best friend, actually.

33:37.849 --> 33:39.308
Oh. How is she?

33:39.392 --> 33:41.769
{\an1}Uh, well, not taking
visitors at the moment.

33:41.853 --> 33:43.104
What's this?

33:43.187 --> 33:45.106
{\an1}We can talk
about it later.

33:45.189 --> 33:46.441
The manager and client for me?

33:46.524 --> 33:48.735
You said you were here
on business. Is this it?

33:48.818 --> 33:51.070
You might want to open that
when you're alone.

33:54.824 --> 33:57.410
Lauren is suing me
for divorce?

33:57.493 --> 33:59.120
She's doing it for you.

33:59.203 --> 34:01.956
Matt, she loves you.

34:02.039 --> 34:03.916
Yeah, she loves me,
but she's divorcing me.

34:04.000 --> 34:05.126
That doesn't make sense.

34:05.209 --> 34:06.627
When I saw you two in New York,

34:06.711 --> 34:08.129
and she asked to see me alone.

34:08.212 --> 34:09.505
Yeah? She wanted
to say good-bye.

34:09.589 --> 34:11.007
She wanted to see a lawyer.

34:11.090 --> 34:14.135
{\an1}I sat with her while
those were being drawn up.

34:14.217 --> 34:16.137
Look, this was not easy for her,

34:16.219 --> 34:18.973
but she was determined,

34:19.056 --> 34:20.224
and she was sane.

34:36.532 --> 34:38.618
You're shredding it?

34:39.702 --> 34:40.578
{\an3}Yeah.

34:40.661 --> 34:44.165
Who knows? Maybe
Mark Chapel was just lonely.

34:44.248 --> 34:46.167
Maybe he made an appointment
with a call girl

34:46.250 --> 34:47.460
and never kept it.

34:47.543 --> 34:49.837
Or maybe he made a lot
of appointments,

34:49.920 --> 34:51.630
and that's why
his marriage broke up.

34:51.714 --> 34:53.507
Spare me the details, okay?

34:53.591 --> 34:56.177
I've been down the disappearing
parrot road before.

34:56.260 --> 34:57.178
(shredder whirring)

34:57.261 --> 34:59.138
{\an3}(sighs):
When I was young,

34:59.222 --> 35:01.015
my parents told me
they were getting a divorce.

35:01.098 --> 35:02.308
I couldn't believe it.

35:02.391 --> 35:03.518
They hardly ever fought.

35:03.601 --> 35:05.311
They were trying
to protectYeah.

35:05.394 --> 35:06.604
Maybe.

35:06.687 --> 35:08.940
Anyway, the next day,
my dad takes me over

35:09.023 --> 35:10.608
to my new room at his place.

35:10.691 --> 35:11.818
Oh, it was great.

35:11.901 --> 35:14.695
It had bunk beds
and indoor climbing forts.

35:14.779 --> 35:16.030
It had everything.

35:16.114 --> 35:17.240
The guy really tried.

35:17.323 --> 35:19.158
But then I saw the laundry

35:19.242 --> 35:21.869
building up in his closet.

35:21.953 --> 35:25.164
Saw the expired dairy products
in his refrigerator.

35:25.248 --> 35:28.334
I knew then that he had left us
a long time ago.

35:28.417 --> 35:30.086
You know,
not all marriages fail.

35:30.169 --> 35:31.420
Not all men cheat.

35:32.797 --> 35:35.424
It's just that
when you see it happen,

35:35.508 --> 35:37.718
like the way
we did this week, it...

35:37.802 --> 35:39.512
(sighs)

35:39.595 --> 35:41.597
It kind of opens up old wounds.

35:43.140 --> 35:45.226
(paper tearing)

35:45.309 --> 35:47.562
(shredder whirring)

35:49.146 --> 35:55.528
After Donna and I talked,
I realized I did make a mistake.

35:55.611 --> 35:58.614
Dr. Martin and I
have agreed to give you

35:58.698 --> 36:02.326
the $60,000
your mother misspent.

36:03.744 --> 36:05.621
Just like that?

36:05.705 --> 36:07.415
I mean, this isn't a loan?

36:07.498 --> 36:10.126
Well, you have to drop the suit.

36:10.209 --> 36:12.253
I don't know if
I would take it.

36:12.336 --> 36:13.421
I mean, she knows
she's gonna lose.

36:13.504 --> 36:15.423
She's just trying to
minimize the damage.

36:15.506 --> 36:18.259
{\an1}Mother, what do you want me
to do, call my lawyer?

36:18.342 --> 36:19.176
DONNA:
Gina?

36:19.260 --> 36:22.013
You asked me to stick up
for you, and I am.

36:23.347 --> 36:25.766
Look, Gina,

36:25.850 --> 36:28.102
I want to help you.

36:28.185 --> 36:31.272
And I'm sorry I was unavailable
when you needed me.

36:31.355 --> 36:33.941
Oh, well, I'm
sort of sorry

36:34.025 --> 36:35.860
{\an3}for all those names
I called you.

36:37.028 --> 36:38.029
Such as?

36:38.112 --> 36:40.615
{\an1}Well, just when
I was growing up,

36:40.698 --> 36:43.743
{\an1}I thought "stuck-up bitch"
was kind of one word.

36:43.826 --> 36:45.620
(gasps)

36:45.703 --> 36:46.954
(both laughing)

36:47.038 --> 36:50.291
{\an3}(cackling)

36:50.374 --> 36:52.877
(laughing)

36:54.837 --> 36:55.880
You know, I don't think

36:55.963 --> 36:57.965
{\an3}Donald Trump would have
pushed this through faster.

36:58.049 --> 37:00.968
Yeah, he could, if he were
willing to do the work himself.

37:01.052 --> 37:02.136
{\an3}(laughs)

37:02.219 --> 37:03.471
Well, thank you, Mr. McKay.

37:03.554 --> 37:06.807
{\an1}Oh... you can just
call me Dylan.

37:06.891 --> 37:08.976
{\an1}The mister part
kind of freaks me out.

37:09.060 --> 37:11.646
{\an3}I read it on your
extremely generous check.

37:11.729 --> 37:12.813
Thank you very much.

37:12.897 --> 37:14.565
Take good care.

37:18.736 --> 37:20.738
Why did you ask me here?

37:21.906 --> 37:24.325
I hate this place.

37:24.408 --> 37:25.826
{\an1}My brother died
in this hospital.

37:25.910 --> 37:28.704
I appreciate
your coming.

37:28.788 --> 37:31.165
{\an1}If you're worried about me
offing myself again,

37:31.248 --> 37:33.376
forget about it.

37:33.459 --> 37:35.503
I already live in hell.

37:35.586 --> 37:37.672
{\an3}No, I think
I found us a way out.

37:37.755 --> 37:39.674
{\an3}Come on.

37:39.757 --> 37:42.468
(children shouting)

37:42.551 --> 37:45.012
{\an3}These kids need
a new playground.

37:45.096 --> 37:46.973
I say we give it to them.

37:47.056 --> 37:48.724
You mean, build it?

37:48.808 --> 37:51.644
{\an3}Well, I saw that tree house
you were tearing apart

37:51.727 --> 37:52.812
in your backyard.

37:52.895 --> 37:55.731
Figure maybe it's time to put
something back together.

37:57.608 --> 38:00.027
They're waiting.

38:01.946 --> 38:04.031
(laughing)

38:05.574 --> 38:07.660
So this equipment
will do the trick?

38:07.743 --> 38:09.537
It's ours to fail with.

38:10.579 --> 38:12.581
Check it out.

38:17.003 --> 38:18.462
Hey.

38:18.546 --> 38:20.047
Uh, listen,

38:20.131 --> 38:21.507
we're all going
to the After Dark tonight.

38:21.590 --> 38:23.175
Thought maybe
if you wanted to meet up.

38:23.259 --> 38:24.510
Uh, I don't know. I...

38:24.593 --> 38:26.846
{\an1}It's a group thing.
You won't even know I'm there.

38:26.929 --> 38:30.558
Oh, my goodness,
I am so unbelievably grateful!

38:30.641 --> 38:32.935
So's my mom. So's my little
brother, my teacher.

38:33.019 --> 38:35.104
You... you saved my life.
This guy--

38:35.187 --> 38:36.397
he's the best.

38:36.480 --> 38:37.440
{\an3}Heaps of
good Karma.

38:37.523 --> 38:38.607
Tons of happiness.

38:38.691 --> 38:39.900
That's what you deserve.

38:39.984 --> 38:41.068
Thank you.

38:41.152 --> 38:42.278
(squeals)

38:42.361 --> 38:44.321
Client. I... Yeah.

38:44.405 --> 38:46.407
{\an1}You know, that's what Lauren
was trying to tell you

38:46.490 --> 38:47.825
with those papers she sent.

38:47.908 --> 38:49.910
You deserve everything.

38:49.994 --> 38:52.788
I blackmailed
the deputy district attorney

38:52.872 --> 38:54.665
is what I did.

38:54.749 --> 38:57.960
Yes, but you did everything
you could to save your wife.

38:58.044 --> 38:59.420
So, what are you saying?

38:59.503 --> 39:00.921
You win some, you lose some?

39:01.005 --> 39:03.549
Lauren wants you to live

39:03.632 --> 39:07.178
the kind of life she wants
but can't have,

39:07.261 --> 39:09.472
even if it's without her.

39:09.555 --> 39:12.558
Kelly, I feel really guilty
about us.

39:12.641 --> 39:14.101
You know, when Lauren came here,

39:14.185 --> 39:16.270
and-and I thought
we had a second chance,

39:16.353 --> 39:17.605
I-I just... I felt...

39:17.688 --> 39:20.232
Guilty about hurting me.

39:20.316 --> 39:21.442
Right.

39:21.525 --> 39:23.402
Well, it did hurt

39:23.486 --> 39:25.446
more than I can tell you.

39:25.529 --> 39:27.448
You asked if there was

39:27.531 --> 39:29.617
a reason why I needed more time,

39:29.700 --> 39:31.952
and I thought there was,
but there isn't.

39:32.036 --> 39:33.788
I'm still a mess, you know?

39:33.871 --> 39:36.040
Join the club.

39:39.877 --> 39:41.629
{\an1}(laughing)

39:41.712 --> 39:42.463
I told you she'd pay.

39:42.546 --> 39:43.547
Oh.

39:43.631 --> 39:47.468
Well, I had my doubts when
you called me about this,

39:47.551 --> 39:48.803
but you were right.

39:48.886 --> 39:51.472
{\an1}Her lawyers at, uh,
Fop, Phooey and Phony...

39:51.555 --> 39:52.807
{\an3}(giggling)

39:52.890 --> 39:54.809
{\an1}...were no match
for my little Gina Bina.

39:54.892 --> 39:58.604
Guess what I
did for you.

39:58.687 --> 40:01.982
{\an3}I got you bumped up to
first class like you love.

40:02.066 --> 40:03.442
Ooh. Sweet.

40:03.526 --> 40:05.528
And I also...

40:07.738 --> 40:10.991
This is your portion of
what we scammed from Felice.

40:11.075 --> 40:11.992
Whoa.

40:12.076 --> 40:12.993
Put it away, Mom.

40:13.077 --> 40:15.162
(cackling)

40:15.246 --> 40:17.248
(laughing)

40:19.583 --> 40:21.168
You know, if Matt
doesn't show up,

40:21.252 --> 40:22.878
{\an1}you can always cry
on my shoulder.

40:22.962 --> 40:24.672
Oh, they're big,
broad shoulders.

40:24.755 --> 40:26.882
It's very nice of
you, but I'm fine.

40:26.966 --> 40:28.008
Okay.

40:28.092 --> 40:29.260
{\an3}(chuckles)

40:29.343 --> 40:30.386
I'll be right back, guys.

40:30.469 --> 40:33.389
DAVID (over the air):
I want to thank all the women

40:33.472 --> 40:36.016
who answered my plea
for a girlfriend.

40:36.100 --> 40:39.145
All submissions
were gratefully received,

40:39.228 --> 40:42.148
but the contest is over.

40:42.231 --> 40:44.900
'Cause I remembered something.

40:46.735 --> 40:50.531
I remembered
how love kind of sinks

40:50.614 --> 40:52.700
its teeth in
when you're not looking.

40:52.783 --> 40:55.411
You can't make it happen
or re-create it,

40:55.494 --> 40:57.413
no matter how hard you try, so

40:57.496 --> 41:00.624
I am hereby

41:00.708 --> 41:04.420
officially...
giving it up to fate.

41:05.421 --> 41:07.506
Thank you.

41:07.590 --> 41:09.592
(Latin music playing)

41:29.570 --> 41:31.614
{\an3}What?

41:31.697 --> 41:33.657
If you are giving up,

41:33.741 --> 41:36.327
why are you playing our song?

41:36.410 --> 41:39.455
You... you're...?

41:39.538 --> 41:40.915
Claudia.

41:40.998 --> 41:42.458
Why didn't you
call me back?

41:42.541 --> 41:45.419
I was testing fate, too.

41:45.502 --> 41:49.131
Which isn't a stretch,
since we work together.

41:49.215 --> 41:50.257
{\an1}Mm.ughs)

41:50.341 --> 41:54.136
I didn't realize you're the girl
who cleans the club.

41:55.721 --> 41:57.848
Well, I'm here
three mornings a week

41:57.932 --> 41:59.725
for the last month.

42:01.852 --> 42:03.479
Don't look so shocked.

42:03.562 --> 42:06.106
I didn't mean
to sneak up on you.

42:07.691 --> 42:09.443
{\an3}I was just saying
how that can happen.

42:09.527 --> 42:10.945
I heard.

42:11.028 --> 42:12.696
Lucky for you.

42:14.198 --> 42:16.242
And me.

42:21.330 --> 42:22.790
Okay, you guys,
I'm out of here.

42:22.873 --> 42:23.958
OhBye.e.

42:24.041 --> 42:26.126
{\an1}See you later, Kelly.
Drive safe.

42:38.514 --> 42:39.765
{\an3}Hey.

42:39.848 --> 42:40.975
Hey.

42:41.058 --> 42:42.309
Sorry I'm late.

42:42.393 --> 42:44.478
{\an1}Oh, I didn't think
you were coming.

42:44.561 --> 42:46.480
Yeah. Well, uh,

42:46.563 --> 42:48.649
it's just...

42:48.732 --> 42:50.150
{\an3}It's taking me
the longest time

42:50.234 --> 42:52.236
{\an3}to do anything
these days.

42:54.196 --> 42:56.198
Kelly...

42:57.700 --> 43:00.577
{\an3}It's just that she was
such a big part of my life.

43:02.746 --> 43:04.164
I know.

43:04.248 --> 43:06.250
And so are you.
