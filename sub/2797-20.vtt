Hi, I'm Pitch Kickham,

00:22.083 --> 00:24.166
and your eyes
are not playing tricks on you.

00:24.250 --> 00:26.542
My shorts are incredibly snug.

00:26.625 --> 00:27.750
You're welcome.

00:28.834 --> 00:30.792
My game's so tight, I can't lose.

00:32.041 --> 00:34.166
Celebrate the launch
of the all-new McHuggers today

00:34.250 --> 00:36.709
at the Pitch Kickham
Shoot Out Kicktacular.

00:38.000 --> 00:39.917
If you can block my shot,
you and a friend will win

00:40.000 --> 00:43.250
a dream trip with me,
Pitch Kickham, in a limo to the airport.

00:43.333 --> 00:45.583
McHuggers!

00:45.667 --> 00:49.208
When you asked me to hold
your spot in line for the Kicktacular,

00:49.291 --> 00:51.250
you didn't say anything about standing.

00:51.333 --> 00:53.917
Have you tried leaning?

00:54.000 --> 00:55.917
Hmm...

00:56.000 --> 00:58.291
You just bought yourself five minutes.

01:00.333 --> 01:03.125

-(glass shatters)

01:06.500 --> 01:08.959
Now hurry up
or I'm gonna have to do this thing.

01:09.041 --> 01:11.417
And doing things ain't my thing.

01:11.500 --> 01:12.959
-It's your thing.
-(beeps)

01:15.625 --> 01:18.542
The Ninja is escaping.
Get up and capture him!

01:19.291 --> 01:21.083
Hmm? Ninja sprint!

01:23.917 --> 01:25.083
Yah!

01:26.750 --> 01:28.542
No honkin' way!

01:28.625 --> 01:31.542
McHuggers! They don't
come out till tomorrow. (gasps)

01:32.875 --> 01:36.000
These make your game so tight,
you can't lose.

01:37.542 --> 01:38.709
Yoink!

01:39.834 --> 01:42.417
Those are tiny.
How am I supposed to put those on?

01:42.500 --> 01:44.709
-(snarling)
-(crash)

01:45.875 --> 01:48.291
The Ninja stole my McHuggers!

01:48.375 --> 01:52.166
Looks like we're one short short. (laughs)

01:52.250 --> 01:54.625

Let's make this quick, NinjaNomicon.
I only got two more stops. (gasps)

02:11.417 --> 02:12.834
Whoa!

02:16.333 --> 02:18.083

02:23.417 --> 02:26.875
"A Ninja's hand is to give, not to take."

02:26.959 --> 02:29.583
Give? I'm not giving McFist anything.

02:29.667 --> 02:31.959
That guy's an evil shoob. Hmm?

Excuse me, this is my stop, so...

02:43.458 --> 02:46.291
(Slimovitz) Let's give
a big Norrisville welcome to...

02:46.375 --> 02:47.750
Pitch Kickham!

02:47.834 --> 02:51.166
(cheering)

02:53.625 --> 02:58.000
Mr. Kickham, riding in a limo
with you has been a lifelong goal.

02:58.083 --> 03:00.000

-(crickets chirping)
-(girl gulps)

03:21.458 --> 03:25.000
Ugh! There you are. Why are you
all the way at the end of the line?

03:25.083 --> 03:27.166
I can lean, or I can move up.

03:27.250 --> 03:30.667
Turns out I'm a leaner.
What's with the street clothes?

03:30.750 --> 03:32.375
You can't block Kickham in streets.

03:32.458 --> 03:35.458
If you ruin our limo ride to the airport,
so help me...

03:35.542 --> 03:38.208
Relax, baby. Look what I got.

03:38.291 --> 03:39.500
No. No. I don't wanna look.

03:39.583 --> 03:42.583
(gasps) Are those...

03:42.667 --> 03:46.375
McHuggers.
My game's so tight I can't lose.

03:46.458 --> 03:48.291
So Bruce! How'd you get 'em?

03:48.375 --> 03:50.208
It's a soccer ball. I don't get it.

03:50.291 --> 03:52.875
It's a thematically camouflaged "ID bot"

03:52.959 --> 03:55.667
programmed to find the only person
wearing the McHuggers.

03:56.625 --> 03:57.917
Still not getting it.

03:58.000 --> 04:00.917
Find the McHuggers, find the Ninja.

04:01.000 --> 04:03.959
I love it. ID bot, activate. Hmm?

04:04.041 --> 04:05.959
You have to use this.

04:06.041 --> 04:07.959
ID bot, activate.

04:08.041 --> 04:11.125
-You gotta swipe it.
-I know that.

04:18.000 --> 04:19.000
(beeping)

04:19.083 --> 04:21.375
So you stole them from McFist.

04:21.458 --> 04:23.458
Took them from McFist.
It's totally different.

04:23.542 --> 04:26.917
And you're missing the point. With these
sick shorts, I'll own this 'tish.

04:27.000 --> 04:29.125
It'll be you, me, Kicks and the open road.

04:29.208 --> 04:30.875
Is "'tish" short for competition?

04:30.959 --> 04:32.834
-Yeah. Too much?
-No, I like it.

05:10.083 --> 05:12.208
Don't know. Not really a sports guy.

05:12.291 --> 05:14.125
And why is it trying to find McHuggers?

05:14.208 --> 05:15.750
They don't go on sale till tomorrow.

05:15.834 --> 05:18.083
I mean, no one's got them but me.

05:18.166 --> 05:20.959
It's not looking for the shorts.
It's looking for the Ninja.

06:32.667 --> 06:35.000
which is something I had not considered.

06:35.083 --> 06:37.750
You didn't "consider"
that the spokesperson for McHuggers would

06:37.834 --> 06:41.583

don't follow the game, but...

07:33.625 --> 07:37.125
I don't know. Beats me. Some questions
have no answers. That's what I've found.

07:37.208 --> 07:39.583

07:39.667 --> 07:42.375

08:20.792 --> 08:22.375
What do I do?

08:22.458 --> 08:24.875
Stop pointing it at stuff!

08:27.792 --> 08:30.333
It's been an honor
sharing the pitch with you, Ninja.

08:32.125 --> 08:34.041
You too, Pitch Kickham.

08:34.125 --> 08:36.166
Is this a Ninja thing?

08:36.250 --> 08:38.041
Is that a Ninja thing?

08:38.125 --> 08:40.959
Looks to me like he's got his hands
stuck in his McHuggers.

08:41.041 --> 08:45.041
Excellent.
This is the perfect time for phase two.

08:45.125 --> 08:49.875
Or plan B or whatever else
I got cooked up here.

08:49.959 --> 08:53.625
I suppose you could release
your robo-hooligans. (slurps)

08:53.709 --> 08:55.166
Release the robo-hooligans.

08:55.250 --> 08:57.041
You have to swipe it.

08:57.125 --> 08:59.000
Actually, this one is a button.

08:59.083 --> 09:01.250
-Then push it.
-(Ninja) Huh?

09:02.875 --> 09:04.917
(Ninja) Uh-oh.

09:05.000 --> 09:07.417
(laughs)

09:07.500 --> 09:10.250
That's what happens
when you steal McHuggers.

09:14.625 --> 09:17.750
All right. Stealing is stealing,
even if it's from my enemy.

09:17.834 --> 09:19.250
Now how do I get my hands free?

09:19.333 --> 09:23.291
Hey! So let's say
hypothetically my hands were stuck in...

09:23.375 --> 09:25.000
oh, I don't know, a pair of McHuggers.

09:25.083 --> 09:26.667
Any thoughts on how I'd get them out?

09:26.750 --> 09:28.917
-Hypothetically?
-No, actually.

09:29.000 --> 09:30.875
There's a release lever
in the left-hand pocket.

09:30.959 --> 09:32.834
Did you not read the instructions
when you bought them?

09:32.917 --> 09:35.667
I didn't exactly...
You know what? Can we just fight?

09:58.291 --> 10:01.125
Wow. That was a lot of hooligans.

Uh, Ninja. Don't forget about them.

10:09.041 --> 10:10.417

10:10.500 --> 10:12.500
Whoa! What do I do with this thing?

10:12.583 --> 10:13.834
Throw it in.

10:14.500 --> 10:16.166
Ninja ID bot slice!

10:19.583 --> 10:23.458
Yah!
I believe these belong to you.

10:25.875 --> 10:29.250
-Ew!
-(Viceroy) That's nasty, baby.

10:31.000 --> 10:34.166

would've happened if I hadn't endangered

international soccer
superstar Pitch Kickham's life.

10:36.834 --> 10:39.000
Uh, actually,
none of this would've happened

10:39.083 --> 10:40.458

10:40.542 --> 10:42.834
Actually actually,
none of this would've happened

10:42.917 --> 10:44.333

10:44.417 --> 10:47.667

11:36.542 --> 11:37.709
(calliope music)

11:37.792 --> 11:40.625
From the darkest jungles
of Detention Island,

11:40.709 --> 11:44.458
McFreaks so McFreaky, you'll McFreak.

11:44.542 --> 11:47.291
Oh, man! There were McFreaks
on Detention Island?

11:47.375 --> 11:49.333
We should get in trouble
again so we can go see 'em.

11:49.417 --> 11:51.083
Or... and I'm just saying "or,"

11:51.166 --> 11:53.166
we could go to the McFreak Show.

11:53.250 --> 11:56.041
-Hmm?
-(both) McFreak Show!

11:56.125 --> 11:58.583
-(both laughing)
-(man) Hey!

11:58.667 --> 11:59.792
(both) Ooh!

12:02.375 --> 12:04.500
It's the Brucest thing I've ever seen.

12:04.583 --> 12:07.000
Only because you
haven't looked over there.

12:07.083 --> 12:08.500
(plays rock music)

12:08.583 --> 12:10.500
I wonder if it takes requests.

12:10.583 --> 12:12.500
-Cunningham...
-No, I think it's a set play list.

12:12.583 --> 12:14.542
-Maybe if I threw it a few bucks.
-Cunningham, look!

12:17.291 --> 12:19.917
(gasps)

12:20.000 --> 12:21.667
(Randy) "Barnabutt Jones."

12:21.750 --> 12:24.166
I found my spirit animal.

12:24.250 --> 12:26.291
Ahh, taking the weekend off

12:26.375 --> 12:28.750
from destroying the Ninja
is just what I needed.

12:28.834 --> 12:31.583
My McStress level is at an all-time low.

12:31.667 --> 12:35.792
Plus, I came up with this profitable
McFreak Show. Go me! (slurps)

12:35.875 --> 12:39.792
So my plan to round up
the freaks from Detention Island

12:39.875 --> 12:42.125
and exploit them for money was your idea?

12:42.208 --> 12:44.583
High-five, Viceroy. One on one.

12:44.667 --> 12:48.709
Two on two. Come on, smack it,
do it, let's celebrate me.

12:49.667 --> 12:52.458
Where you going?
I got a high-ten with no one to smack it.

12:52.542 --> 12:55.667
I'm going to give
the McFreaks their dose of Aw Juice.

12:55.750 --> 12:58.000
Of course, Aw Juice. And that is...

12:58.083 --> 12:59.458
(growls)

12:59.542 --> 13:00.583
Yikes!

13:02.500 --> 13:04.291
-(yelps)
-Aw Juice.

13:04.375 --> 13:07.375
It stops the Gy-Yikes
before they become Gy-Yooos.

13:07.458 --> 13:09.417
(laughs)

13:09.500 --> 13:12.083
Really feeling good about today.

13:12.166 --> 13:14.417
I've seen many a Bruce thing in my time,

13:14.500 --> 13:17.500
-but Barnabutt Jones is...
-El Bru-chismo.

13:17.583 --> 13:20.083
If we took him to the pet park,
we could rub everyone's faces

13:20.166 --> 13:21.458
in any of his four butts.

13:21.542 --> 13:23.542
You're right.
I absolutely should use

13:23.625 --> 13:25.083
my Ninja skills to spring him.

13:25.166 --> 13:28.208
Yes, do that.
Quick, before the Nomico... Oh!

13:28.291 --> 13:31.875
Right on cue. Gonna have fun?
Not on my watch.

13:31.959 --> 13:35.208
I hate you. You hear me? Hate.

13:35.291 --> 13:38.166
-Better see what it wants.
-(growls)

13:50.250 --> 13:52.959
(Randy)
"What is wild should not be caged."

13:53.041 --> 13:56.041
Wait. You're saying that I should...
Because they're... and I... Oh!

13:56.125 --> 13:58.041
Nomicon, you are the cheese!

13:59.709 --> 14:03.375
Well, go ahead. Tell me how
the Nomicon shoobed us sideways.

14:03.458 --> 14:06.083
It didn't. It didn't shoob us any ways.

14:06.166 --> 14:08.458
Wait, it said...
that you said... because they're...

14:08.542 --> 14:10.917
-And you're...
-That's exactly what I said.

14:11.000 --> 14:12.875
Whoa, Viceroy, what's the rush?

14:12.959 --> 14:15.542
I was thinking you and me
could cruise down to PJ McFlubBusters,

14:15.625 --> 14:18.000
have some laughs,
like we're a couple of regular shmoes.

14:18.083 --> 14:19.792
When you don't focus on the Ninja,

14:19.875 --> 14:21.583
you are a totally different person.

14:21.667 --> 14:24.583
I don't even care
what old pajama-face is up to.

14:24.667 --> 14:27.208
I called him pajama-face.
That's a first...

14:30.709 --> 14:33.417
Oh!

14:33.500 --> 14:35.417
-Mm-hm.
-(alarm blaring)

14:35.500 --> 14:38.041
-(gasps)
-Intruder! Intruder!

14:38.125 --> 14:40.375
Ninja shushing ball.

14:40.375 --> 14:42.709
Or was that a Ninja boom ball?

14:42.792 --> 14:45.333
I gotta start labeling these things.

14:45.417 --> 14:48.792
Aww! You are the cutest thing.
Let's get you outta here.

14:51.208 --> 14:54.917
(sniffling)

14:55.000 --> 14:56.083
(cries)

14:56.166 --> 14:57.917
(Ninja) Hey, Howard.

14:58.000 --> 15:01.208
Trains or cowboys? What do you think?

15:01.375 --> 15:03.542
I think we're going to need a bigger bed.

15:04.834 --> 15:06.250
(gasps)

15:07.208 --> 15:10.000
What do you say?
Splitsies on four McFreaks?

15:10.083 --> 15:12.125
Splitsies on four McFreaks.

15:13.834 --> 15:17.083

I thought yesterday was the best day ever.

15:45.709 --> 15:47.709
But today is gonna be yesterday 2.0.

15:47.792 --> 15:50.417
The second we walk through this gate,
everything changes.

15:50.500 --> 15:51.709
-Are you ready?
-Let's do this.

(mutters)

16:09.875 --> 16:11.917
-(snarling)
-(screams)

16:13.083 --> 16:14.250
(chitters)

16:14.333 --> 16:17.667
Aww, you need a kissy,
make boo-boo go bye-bye?

16:21.583 --> 16:24.792
What a night. Now I know
what PJ McFlubBusters means

16:24.875 --> 16:26.250
by "Open Till Question Mark."

16:26.333 --> 16:27.834
-Gy-Yikes!
-Why'd you "Gy-Yikes"?

16:27.917 --> 16:30.458
-All of the McFreaks have escaped.
-Gy-Yikes!

16:30.542 --> 16:33.166
Ugh! I'm starting to feel stress.

16:33.250 --> 16:35.458
Then I probably shouldn't tell you

16:35.542 --> 16:37.542
that their Aw Juice is about to wear off.

16:37.625 --> 16:39.709
Why didn't you give it to them earlier?

16:39.792 --> 16:43.166
I would have if somebody
hadn't kept me out till question mark.

16:43.250 --> 16:44.500
G-Yooo.

16:44.583 --> 16:47.625
Oh, in about 30 seconds,
G-Yooo can say that again.

16:47.709 --> 16:48.583
(groans)

16:49.417 --> 16:51.709
(screaming)

16:51.792 --> 16:55.125
Why is that octo-bear
touching my bald cat?

16:55.208 --> 16:58.834
Is it me or are the McFreaks
acting a little extra freaky?

16:58.917 --> 17:00.583
(screeches)

17:04.583 --> 17:06.875
Skee-boo, man. Skee-boo!

17:06.959 --> 17:09.333
-What did you do?
-Me? I've been sitting next to you.

17:09.417 --> 17:12.333
Yeah, but I didn't do anything,
so obviously you did.

17:15.166 --> 17:18.500
This is what I get for bringing
an indoor goat to an outdoor pet park.

17:18.583 --> 17:20.208
-(snarls)
-(screams)

17:22.375 --> 17:23.834
(engine turns over)

17:23.917 --> 17:26.792
-(tires screech)
-That McFreak just stole my car!

17:27.667 --> 17:28.709
(whistles)

17:32.208 --> 17:34.417
Things just took a turn for the Ninja.

17:34.500 --> 17:36.417
For the record,
I just wanted to split a monkey.

17:38.625 --> 17:39.834
I'll meet you there.

17:47.250 --> 17:50.917
If I were a McFreak loose in the city,
where would I rampage?

17:51.000 --> 17:54.000
Where would I rampage... Ooh, I know.

17:54.083 --> 17:57.041
I'd rampage at PJ McFlubBusters.

17:57.125 --> 17:59.792
Sir, our McFreaks from our McFreak Show

17:59.875 --> 18:01.792
are about to lay waste to Norrisville,

18:01.875 --> 18:04.000
and this is the only thing
that can stop them.

18:04.083 --> 18:05.500
This is fun, you and me

18:05.583 --> 18:07.625
chasing something that isn't the Ninja.

18:07.709 --> 18:10.709
(sighs) Man, I cannot stop
thinking about those tater skins.

18:10.792 --> 18:12.291
There they are!

18:12.375 --> 18:14.500
(shouting)

18:16.667 --> 18:18.875
Smoke bomb! McFreaks!

18:18.959 --> 18:21.625
Stop this senseless shoobing.

18:21.709 --> 18:23.625
You have to chill.

18:25.792 --> 18:26.709
(roars)

18:30.625 --> 18:31.917
Ninja dodge. Ninja dodge.

18:32.750 --> 18:34.041
Bad 9-Armed Snake.

18:34.125 --> 18:36.208
-Uh-oh.
-(growls)

18:36.291 --> 18:37.875
Rondo, stop.

18:37.959 --> 18:40.208
You don't want to do this. None of you do.

18:40.291 --> 18:44.583
You're good McFreaks. Barnabutt, please,
anything as beautiful as you can't be bad.

18:44.667 --> 18:46.917
Talk to them. They listen to you.

18:47.625 --> 18:49.000
(farts)

18:52.709 --> 18:54.750
(farting)

18:58.083 --> 19:01.208
Thank you, freaks. Now let's get you
back in that garage where you belong.

19:02.375 --> 19:04.542
(McFist)
<i>You are property of McFist Industries.</i>

19:04.625 --> 19:06.959
<i>Come quietly or be shocked.</i>

19:07.041 --> 19:10.125
Great timing.
I just got them to calm down.

19:23.959 --> 19:26.959
Mind if I "butt" in? (laughs)

19:27.041 --> 19:29.792
Because he's got all these butts and...

19:29.875 --> 19:32.083
I'm just gonna stab you now.

19:33.500 --> 19:34.917
Yep, that hurt. Ow!

19:38.417 --> 19:41.250
Sonic fart. Schnasty!

19:47.417 --> 19:49.667
Aw, man! I missed everything.

19:49.750 --> 19:51.458
Stupid monkey bike.

19:52.750 --> 19:54.750
(all moaning)

19:56.208 --> 19:57.542
You have fun, McFreaks?

19:57.625 --> 20:01.709
I hope so, because you're going back
in your cages forever.

20:01.792 --> 20:06.250
Rondo, when we get home, we're having
a talk about personal hygiene.

20:06.333 --> 20:08.208
Ninja? Ninja!

20:08.291 --> 20:10.667
The one weekend
I try not to catch the Ninja,

20:10.750 --> 20:13.166
I catch the Ninja. Get him!

20:13.250 --> 20:14.417
(gasps)

20:18.417 --> 20:20.250
-(growls)
-Ow! Oh.

20:20.333 --> 20:24.000
Viceroy, Aw Juice
the Freaks then destroy the Ninja.

20:24.083 --> 20:26.000
What the cheese is Aw Juice?

20:26.083 --> 20:27.792
It's the chemical compound that keeps

20:27.875 --> 20:29.959
the before from becoming an after.

20:30.792 --> 20:32.792
All right, back in your cages.

20:32.875 --> 20:36.917
"What is wild should not be caged."
(gasps)

20:37.000 --> 20:39.041
Totally missed that.

20:39.125 --> 20:42.000
I'm sorry, McFreaks.
I was no better than McFist.

20:42.083 --> 20:44.250
You don't belong in cages or in garages.

20:44.333 --> 20:46.000
Garages? What's he talking about, garages?

20:46.083 --> 20:47.875
-Hiya!
-Ahh!

20:51.041 --> 20:53.792
Ninja juice. Snatch!

20:53.875 --> 20:56.959
How am I supposed have
a McFreak Show without Aw Juice?

20:57.041 --> 20:58.500
You're not. No one is.

20:58.583 --> 21:00.625
-(growling)
-(shouts)

21:05.375 --> 21:08.333
-Anyone know how to fly a hovercraft?
-(squawks)

21:09.959 --> 21:12.917
(grunting)
The better question would have been,

21:13.000 --> 21:15.834
"Does anyone know
how to land a hovercraft?"

21:15.917 --> 21:18.333
Listen, I was wrong to keep you as pets.

21:18.417 --> 21:21.792
You should be free. Welcome back
to Detention Island, McFreaks.

21:22.792 --> 21:23.667
(farts)

21:23.750 --> 21:26.792
(laughs) Barnabutt, come on, man.

21:26.875 --> 21:28.291
I'm trying to make a moment.

21:28.375 --> 21:31.083
You know what? That was perfect.
I love you to death. I can't top it.

21:31.166 --> 21:32.333
Smoke bomb ya later.

21:34.458 --> 21:36.417
