00:10.100 --> 00:13.130
- Breakfast!
- Hi, I'm Teddy Duncan,

00:13.170 --> 00:15.400
Reporting live from the
kitchen where, once again,

00:15.440 --> 00:18.510
Mom has taken an innocent
pancake and destroyed it.

00:18.540 --> 00:20.140
Your thoughts?

00:20.180 --> 00:22.340
Why are you insulting me into a fork?

00:22.380 --> 00:25.210
I'm joining the South high
action news team.

00:25.250 --> 00:28.320
- Today's the first meeting.
- Oh, that is so exciting!

00:28.350 --> 00:30.380
You know, Teddy, when I
was reporting for the...

00:30.420 --> 00:33.020
Southwest Denver community college tv news.

00:33.060 --> 00:36.620
Oh, how funny.
Heh heh.

00:36.660 --> 00:38.830
- Guess I must have...
- Mentioned that before.

00:38.860 --> 00:41.460
Anyway, when I was reporting,

00:41.500 --> 00:43.030
I had this really cute catchphrase.

00:43.070 --> 00:44.630
It went a little something like this:

00:44.670 --> 00:47.340
I'm Amy blankenhooper,
gettin' all up in your news.

00:50.340 --> 00:51.770
Morning.

00:51.810 --> 00:56.080
Ooh, pancakes.
Yay.

00:57.650 --> 01:00.510
Uh, maybe I'll pick up
something on the way to work.

01:00.550 --> 01:05.220
When he won't eat it, that's a bad pancake.

01:05.250 --> 01:07.660
Has anyone seen my boots?

01:07.690 --> 01:09.290
Looks like Charlie has.

01:09.320 --> 01:12.130
<i>That's adorable!</i>

01:12.160 --> 01:14.830
Miss Duncan, are you aware
that dad sometimes.

01:14.860 --> 01:17.160
Has to pour sweat out of those boots?

01:17.200 --> 01:19.070
Ew.

01:19.100 --> 01:21.600
Out of the mouths of babes.

01:21.640 --> 01:23.540
- This is Teddy Duncan...
- And Amy Duncan...

01:23.570 --> 01:26.140
- Mom, it's a fork. - ...
Gettin' all up in your news.

02:26.970 --> 02:28.870
Oh, hey, sis.
You want to sit together?

02:28.900 --> 02:30.640
Yeah sure, I'd love to.

02:33.680 --> 02:36.110
- Oh, it never gets old.
- Yeah.

02:37.180 --> 02:40.380
Oh, wait.
Is that dustin Reese?

02:40.420 --> 02:42.150
<i>Who's dustin Reese?</i>

02:42.180 --> 02:44.450
We went to kindergarten together.

02:44.490 --> 02:48.390
Back then he had a ponytail until...

02:55.630 --> 02:57.500
Why'd you cut off his ponytail?

02:57.530 --> 02:59.000
It was my first day with scissors.

02:59.030 --> 03:01.840
I had eaten a doughnut.
I was out of my mind.

03:01.870 --> 03:05.310
- So do you think he remembers you?
- I hope not.

03:07.140 --> 03:09.140
Well, here he comes.

03:12.710 --> 03:15.520
What... you could have
just turned around.

03:15.550 --> 03:16.880
Eh.

03:24.130 --> 03:26.090
Okay, everyone, welcome to the South high.

03:26.130 --> 03:29.430
Action news team, or shant.

03:31.370 --> 03:34.200
Anyway, I wanted to apologize
for postponing the meeting.

03:34.240 --> 03:37.340
As you know, I fell
off my bike... Again.

03:37.370 --> 03:39.370
Who laughed?

03:39.410 --> 03:42.440
Me. I was thinking
about something else.

03:42.480 --> 03:45.510
- And what was that?
- The first time you fell off your bike.

03:46.680 --> 03:48.850
Moving on.

03:48.880 --> 03:50.520
All right, one of you.

03:50.550 --> 03:52.520
Is going to have a big opportunity.

03:52.550 --> 03:54.690
The channel 8 news
is looking for a teen reporter.

03:54.720 --> 03:58.190
For an internship which includes
a chance to appear on tv.

03:58.230 --> 04:01.300
If you're interested, have a two-minute
piece on my desk by Friday...

04:01.330 --> 04:04.170
Something juicy, explosive,
hard-hitting... ow.

04:05.700 --> 04:07.670
I'll pick the best one
and submit it to channel 8.

04:07.700 --> 04:09.700
<i>Now get to work.</i>

04:12.370 --> 04:14.540
- Oh, and Teddy, was it?
- Yeah.

04:14.580 --> 04:17.339
You're new around here.
A piece of advice...

04:17.380 --> 04:19.010
Don't fall in love with me.

04:19.050 --> 04:20.680
I shan't.

04:29.990 --> 04:31.460
Bob, Bob, big news.

04:31.490 --> 04:33.160
Walt mcguire called and invited us.

04:33.200 --> 04:35.530
- Out to dinner at his country club.
- Who is Walt mcguire?

04:35.560 --> 04:37.530
Honey, he's the hospital administrator.

04:37.570 --> 04:39.270
I talk about him all the time.

04:39.300 --> 04:42.000
And I listen about him all the time.

04:42.040 --> 04:44.740
Ooh ooh ooh.
You know what?

04:44.770 --> 04:47.780
I'm going to wear that dress that makes
people ask if I'm Teddy's sister.

04:47.810 --> 04:49.980
Come on, honey, has anybody ever...

04:53.320 --> 04:55.280
I love that dress.

04:55.320 --> 04:57.890
You know what?

04:57.920 --> 05:00.390
I think I'm going to buy
a new pair of shoes too.

05:00.420 --> 05:02.360
And you might want to try on your suit.

05:02.390 --> 05:04.460
Why would I want to do that?

05:05.730 --> 05:07.730
You might have put on a little weight.

05:07.760 --> 05:10.400
Since our homecoming dance.

05:10.430 --> 05:14.770
- Thank you for saying "might have.
" - Aw.

05:22.980 --> 05:26.080
- P.J.!
- Dustin.

05:26.110 --> 05:27.580
What are you doing here?

05:27.620 --> 05:30.020
Do you remember me from kindergarten?

05:30.050 --> 05:31.590
I... I don't know.

05:31.620 --> 05:34.190
It was... it was
a long time ago.

05:34.220 --> 05:36.560
And which year of kindergarten?

05:37.830 --> 05:39.390
I want to show you something.

05:39.430 --> 05:41.430
Come on out.

05:44.200 --> 05:47.070
- What's all this?
- I came to give you a haircut.

05:47.100 --> 05:49.800
Oh. Oh well,
that's very nice of you,

05:49.840 --> 05:52.140
But I always go to Rachel at crazy cuts.

05:52.170 --> 05:56.110
- Not anymore.
- What do you mean?

05:59.580 --> 06:04.150
Ahh!

06:04.190 --> 06:06.190
No!

06:07.190 --> 06:09.720
Oh.

06:09.760 --> 06:13.660
Why do I always have nightmares
when I nap on this couch?

06:13.700 --> 06:15.700
Eh, five more minutes.

06:27.080 --> 06:31.350
- Why are you sitting with me?
- Because I didn't realize it was you.

06:31.380 --> 06:33.280
Why are you dressed like that?

06:33.320 --> 06:36.150
- I don't want dustin to recognize me.
- Oh, the ponytail kid?

06:36.180 --> 06:38.050
You're worried he's going
to get back at you?

06:38.090 --> 06:41.290
He has gotten into my
dreams, my nap dreams.

06:41.320 --> 06:44.290
That is a place filled
with gumdrops and lollipops.

06:44.330 --> 06:47.360
- He does not belong there!
- Okay.

06:47.400 --> 06:50.660
Well, I'm sorry you had a bad nap,
but I've got a real problem.

06:50.700 --> 06:52.770
I have to come up with a
good news story by Friday.

06:52.800 --> 06:54.700
This could be my chance to be on local tv.

06:54.740 --> 06:57.170
Ugh!

06:57.210 --> 06:59.170
You want a good story,
you should do a report.

06:59.210 --> 07:01.010
On whatever this mystery meat is.

07:02.580 --> 07:05.880
Wait a minute.
That's not bad.

07:05.910 --> 07:07.680
I'll solve the mystery meat mystery.

07:07.720 --> 07:10.750
This disgusting slop could be
my ticket to the big time.

07:10.790 --> 07:13.490
- How's lunch today?
- Oh, really good, thanks.

07:21.400 --> 07:23.030
<i>Hey, honey.</i>

07:23.060 --> 07:27.270
- You get some shoes? - Did I get some shoes?
Did I get some shoes?

07:27.300 --> 07:30.670
I don't know.
You tell me. Ba-bam.

07:30.710 --> 07:33.610
Wow! Nice!

07:33.640 --> 07:37.210
- Yeah, and only $400.
- What?!

07:37.250 --> 07:40.310
Relax, I'm going to return
them the day after the dinner.

07:40.350 --> 07:42.580
I'm just borrowing them.

07:42.620 --> 07:45.220
They're like a library book
that makes my calves look hot.

07:46.920 --> 07:50.490
Honey, no store is going to take
back shoes once you've worn them.

07:50.530 --> 07:51.960
They're not going to know
that I've worn them.

07:51.990 --> 07:54.360
I'm putting tape on the soles
so they don't scuff.

07:54.400 --> 07:56.660
Where did you learn this stuff?

07:56.700 --> 07:59.700
It's an old trick
from my starving student days.

07:59.730 --> 08:01.800
I thought I'd outgrow it
when I was married,

08:01.840 --> 08:05.240
But four kids later
and here we are... ba-bam!

08:06.610 --> 08:09.680
I don't know.
Sounds wrong to me.

08:09.710 --> 08:12.910
- Or we can just pay the $400.
- I'll get the tape.

08:19.720 --> 08:21.760
So you cut a kid's hair in kindergarten.

08:21.790 --> 08:23.220
And now you're all freaked out?

08:23.260 --> 08:26.360
It was the worst thing I ever did.

08:26.390 --> 08:28.360
I don't know, maybe I
should just apologize.

08:28.400 --> 08:32.770
Apologize? I'd cut his hair
again, show him who's boss.

08:34.400 --> 08:38.039
Okay, guys, what do we think, huh?

08:38.070 --> 08:40.240
Huh? Ready for
the country club?

08:40.280 --> 08:42.740
I don't know, dad.
Button the jacket.

08:42.780 --> 08:44.880
That's not going to happen.

08:46.450 --> 08:48.520
So I'm guessing the top
button of your pants.

08:48.550 --> 08:50.220
Is out of the question too?

08:52.390 --> 08:54.190
Yes, sir, it is.

08:55.860 --> 09:00.130
<i>Bob, a little help,
please?</i>

09:00.160 --> 09:02.700
- Need a little help, please?
- What? Whoa, what's wrong?

09:05.670 --> 09:08.200
Turns out that putting tape
on your shoes makes them.

09:08.240 --> 09:10.400
Just a little bit slippery.

09:11.540 --> 09:14.110
Well, why don't you change shoes?

09:14.140 --> 09:16.280
What, and kill the glamour?

09:25.950 --> 09:28.190
How'd you like to pay all that money.

09:28.220 --> 09:31.090
To join the country club
and see that coming in?

09:35.000 --> 09:38.130
What is the meat in mystery meat?

09:38.170 --> 09:41.640
To find out, I decided to sit
down with Lydia the lunch lady.

09:41.670 --> 09:44.670
And ask her some tough questions.

09:47.980 --> 09:51.910
- Pretty good so far, huh?
- Shh! Ow.

09:51.950 --> 09:55.020
<i>So, Lydia,
let's get right to it.</i>

09:55.050 --> 09:56.420
Tell me about the meat.

09:56.450 --> 10:00.320
Does that camera have to be so close?

10:00.360 --> 10:01.920
Why are you sweating?

10:01.960 --> 10:06.860
Because you're shining a very
bright light in my face!

10:08.030 --> 10:09.930
Or is it because you're lying?

10:09.960 --> 10:13.270
What is it, Lydia?
What is the meat?

10:13.300 --> 10:16.270
- Ground beef.
- Is it?

10:16.300 --> 10:18.270
Or is it something else?

10:23.550 --> 10:26.950
Mystery meat...
is it really such a mystery?

10:29.580 --> 10:33.950
This is Teddy Duncan and I'm on your side.

10:36.690 --> 10:39.690
- So, what do you think?
- I can't submit this.

10:39.730 --> 10:43.930
- Why not? - Because there
are no facts, no proof.

10:43.970 --> 10:47.130
I'm sorry, but it stinks.

10:47.170 --> 10:50.470
But I need that internship.
I want to be on tv.

10:50.510 --> 10:53.070
Then you'd better come up with
something great by tomorrow.

10:53.110 --> 10:55.380
- Oh well, just watch me.
- I don't think you can do it.

10:55.410 --> 10:57.480
- I'm going to make you eat those words.
- Do you want to kiss me.

10:57.510 --> 11:00.210
- As much as I want to kiss you?
- No, I don't.

11:02.090 --> 11:03.100
Worth a shot.

11:16.560 --> 11:19.820
- Aw, that movie was awesome!
- So awesome!

11:19.850 --> 11:22.150
When the blood shot out of that guy's arm,

11:22.190 --> 11:25.320
- It looked so real!
- So real!

11:25.360 --> 11:27.060
What are you guys talking about?

11:27.090 --> 11:31.830
- Uh, nothing.
- We just saw "decapitation 3."

11:31.860 --> 11:34.830
- No, we didn't.
- Yes, we did.

11:34.870 --> 11:37.300
Remember I almost barfed when they used.

11:37.340 --> 11:40.340
That lady's head as a bowling ball?

11:40.370 --> 11:42.740
Wait wait wait.
That movie's rated pg-13.

11:42.780 --> 11:44.110
Who took you guys to go see it?

11:44.140 --> 11:46.910
His mom.
His dad.

11:46.950 --> 11:49.850
We slipped the guy at the box office.

11:49.880 --> 11:52.350
Five extra bucks and he let us in.

11:52.390 --> 11:54.350
What is wrong with you?

11:54.390 --> 11:56.890
She's a direct pipeline to the man.

11:56.920 --> 11:59.420
And by the man I mean my mom.

11:59.460 --> 12:02.530
Okay, so that sleazeball
at the movie theater.

12:02.560 --> 12:04.330
Is taking bribes from kids?

12:04.360 --> 12:07.770
That's... Fantastic!

12:07.800 --> 12:09.470
- It is?
- Yes yes.

12:09.500 --> 12:11.640
This is exactly the kind of story I need.

12:11.670 --> 12:14.810
This is going to put me on tv,
where I belong.

12:14.840 --> 12:16.640
You sound like mom.

12:16.680 --> 12:18.710
Shut up.

12:21.580 --> 12:23.850
Ugh, nice job.

12:23.880 --> 12:27.320
- We're probably going to get
in trouble now. - I'm sorry.

12:27.350 --> 12:30.290
Hey, you want some melted pocket chocolate?

12:30.320 --> 12:33.260
That's disgusting.

12:34.830 --> 12:36.860
Yeah, okay.

12:43.070 --> 12:46.240
- Emergency! Bob, we have an emergency.
- What? What is it?

12:46.270 --> 12:48.640
- The shoes are gone.
- Nobody move!

12:48.670 --> 12:50.910
This house is on lockdown!

12:50.940 --> 12:53.550
What... wh-when was
the last time you saw them?

12:53.580 --> 12:56.210
Um, uh, when I got home last night,

12:56.250 --> 12:58.680
I put them in the box and went to bed.

12:58.720 --> 13:01.320
Then I got out of bed to go to
the bathroom, put them back on,

13:01.350 --> 13:03.920
Went to the bathroom, put them
back in the box and went to bed.

13:03.960 --> 13:06.520
Wait, why would you put on
shoes to go to the bathroom?

13:06.560 --> 13:09.560
Because they make everything an event.

13:09.600 --> 13:13.130
Honey, look, the only event right
now is that we're out $400.

13:13.170 --> 13:14.970
We've got to find the shoes!

13:15.000 --> 13:16.330
<i>- Hey, guys.
- Hey.</i>

13:16.370 --> 13:19.040
Hi. Why is Charlie
so dirty?

13:19.070 --> 13:20.710
We were playing Chase in the yard.

13:20.740 --> 13:22.740
And because she was wearing high
heels, she slipped and fell.

13:22.780 --> 13:25.710
- What heels?
- These.

13:25.750 --> 13:28.910
- No! - Yeah. Yeah, she looked
pretty cute in them too.

13:28.950 --> 13:30.420
I got some great pics on my phone.

13:30.450 --> 13:31.720
- You guys want to see?
- Ugh.

13:31.750 --> 13:33.250
See?

13:36.390 --> 13:39.690
It's funny, not sad.

13:55.440 --> 13:57.810
Hey, dustin, how's it going?

13:57.840 --> 14:00.710
I'm P.J.
I don't know if you remember me.

14:00.750 --> 14:03.620
- We went to kindergarten together.
- We did?

14:03.650 --> 14:08.090
Yeah yeah, I was the kid who
glued his face to the desk.

14:08.120 --> 14:10.790
I was the kid who got his tongue
caught in the hamster wheel.

14:12.430 --> 14:15.660
I was the kid who cut off your ponytail.

14:15.700 --> 14:18.300
Oh yeah, I remember that.

14:18.330 --> 14:19.760
Yeah yeah.

14:19.800 --> 14:22.270
Listen, I know it's probably
way too late for this,

14:22.300 --> 14:24.670
But I just... I want
to say I'm really sorry.

14:24.700 --> 14:27.270
Eh, don't worry about it.
It was a long time ago.

14:27.310 --> 14:29.240
- So you're not mad?
- Not at all.

14:29.280 --> 14:32.410
Oh, that's so great, man.
You mind if I stay?

14:32.450 --> 14:33.910
- Sure sure.
- Cool.

14:33.950 --> 14:36.550
You're not going to cut
my hair again, are you?

14:40.090 --> 14:42.390
- Oh. Whoo.
- Yeah.

14:50.330 --> 14:52.960
Okay okay, you guys, come on.
So here's the plan:

14:53.000 --> 14:55.600
Gabe, you'll buy the tickets.
Jake, you'll wear this hat.

14:55.630 --> 14:57.770
It has a camera in it and
it'll record the whole thing.

14:57.800 --> 15:00.210
I don't look good in hats.

15:00.240 --> 15:01.810
Jake, come on, we got to do this.

15:01.840 --> 15:05.010
Dude, my hair is my best feature.

15:06.410 --> 15:09.350
Okay, well, if you guys
don't go through with this,

15:09.380 --> 15:11.650
I'll tell both your moms
about "decapitation 3"...

15:11.680 --> 15:13.150
And "1" and "2."

15:13.190 --> 15:17.390
- Uh, you know about those?
- I do now.

15:19.090 --> 15:20.760
Can I at least wear it backwards?

15:20.790 --> 15:22.560
It's more hip hop that way.

15:28.530 --> 15:31.500
What he lacks in brains
he makes up for in...

15:32.570 --> 15:34.110
He's got a pool.

15:44.450 --> 15:45.950
Sponge.

15:52.120 --> 15:53.630
Marker.

15:59.370 --> 16:00.900
Pretzel.

16:08.470 --> 16:10.440
- Are they going to make it?
- Shh.

16:10.480 --> 16:13.550
A very critical part of the operation.

16:14.650 --> 16:17.720
I need absolute quiet.

16:17.750 --> 16:20.890
- Hey, guys! How's it going?
- Ooh! My gosh!

16:22.720 --> 16:24.220
Did we lose her?

16:27.160 --> 16:29.260
- What is it, P.J.?
- This is dustin.

16:29.300 --> 16:30.730
Is it okay if he sleeps over?

16:30.760 --> 16:34.770
- Sure. Hi. Fine.
- Cool, thanks.

16:34.800 --> 16:38.200
- What are they doing? - I don't know.
Playing catch with shoes.

16:43.980 --> 16:45.980
Go go.

16:49.750 --> 16:51.620
Two tickets for "decapitation 3," please.

16:51.650 --> 16:53.720
Ooh, that's pg-13, guys.

16:53.750 --> 16:56.650
And since I don't see
any adults around here,

16:56.690 --> 16:58.260
If you want to buy a ticket,

16:58.290 --> 17:01.860
There's going to be a handling fee.

17:01.890 --> 17:05.160
<i>Hey, maybe we should see
"fishy friendz" instead.</i>

17:06.430 --> 17:08.000
No no no no.
Look at Gabe!

17:08.030 --> 17:09.599
Look at Gabe!
Oh!

17:09.640 --> 17:12.369
<i>It features the voice talents</i>

17:12.400 --> 17:15.369
<i>Of Steve carell
and Rosie Perez.</i>

17:15.410 --> 17:18.780
Enjoy the show.

17:23.119 --> 17:25.380
- Okay, are we done now?
- No no, you didn't get it.

17:25.420 --> 17:27.450
Jake was looking at the
poster for "fishy friendz."

17:27.490 --> 17:30.690
I couldn't help it.
The fish was wearing glasses.

17:30.720 --> 17:32.820
That's hilarious!

17:32.860 --> 17:35.490
All right, we're doing this again.

17:35.530 --> 17:37.330
This time I'm wearing the hat.

17:37.360 --> 17:39.100
Here.

17:39.130 --> 17:41.130
Jake, you wait here.

17:43.700 --> 17:46.600
- One ticket for "decapitation 3.
" - Weren't you just here?

17:46.640 --> 17:49.340
Yeah, I was here and you were there.

17:49.380 --> 17:51.010
And I gave you some money.

17:51.040 --> 17:52.510
Now do you want to do it again or not?

17:52.550 --> 17:55.210
Okay, you know the drill.

17:55.250 --> 17:57.250
Handling fee.

18:04.390 --> 18:06.690
Excuse me, did you just
sell an 11-year-old boy.

18:06.730 --> 18:08.460
A ticket
to a pg-13 movie?

18:08.490 --> 18:11.260
What? I... I don't know
what you're talking about.

18:11.300 --> 18:13.670
Oh yeah? Okay.
Well, I think you do.

18:13.700 --> 18:17.340
Because I just caught the whole thing on my hat Cam.
Care to make a statement?

18:17.370 --> 18:19.570
Yeah. How about...
how about I give you.

18:19.610 --> 18:21.170
Two free tickets to "fishy friendz"

18:21.210 --> 18:22.670
And we make this thing go away, huh?

18:22.710 --> 18:25.040
Do it!

18:25.080 --> 18:28.710
Busted! This is Teddy
Duncan, teen reporter.

18:28.750 --> 18:32.480
Remember, when there's news
to be reported, then...

18:32.520 --> 18:35.250
The one reporting it will be me.

18:35.290 --> 18:36.960
I'll fix that later.

18:45.730 --> 18:48.470
- Good morning.
- Hey.

18:51.840 --> 18:53.300
Why are you holding the mirror?

18:53.340 --> 18:55.640
Because now we're even.

18:55.670 --> 18:58.680
Ahh!

19:00.080 --> 19:01.910
Ah!

19:02.950 --> 19:05.850
Dude, I just had the weirdest dream.

19:05.880 --> 19:08.820
Really? What about?

19:08.850 --> 19:11.720
It was actually kind of crazy.

19:11.760 --> 19:14.330
To get back at me you shaved half my head.

19:14.360 --> 19:18.060
Wow. Wow, that is crazy.

19:18.100 --> 19:20.700
- Should we get some breakfast?
- Yeah, sounds good.

19:24.840 --> 19:27.410
- Are you chilly?
-.

19:27.440 --> 19:30.440
I'm a little chilly.
Huh.

19:36.920 --> 19:40.320
<i>This is Teddy duncan
getting all up in your news.</i>

19:42.590 --> 19:44.520
So what do you think?

19:44.560 --> 19:47.930
It's hard-hitting,
informative and entertaining.

19:47.960 --> 19:51.000
It's the best piece I've seen all semester and...
I'm killing it.

19:51.030 --> 19:54.300
- What? Why?
- That box office guy is my brother.

19:54.330 --> 19:55.800
- Your brother?
- Yeah.

19:55.830 --> 19:58.370
I got the looks, but he got the crazy.

19:58.400 --> 20:00.240
Wait, but I want that internship.

20:00.270 --> 20:02.040
- He's my ride to school.
- That's not fair.

20:02.070 --> 20:03.540
- Life isn't fair.
- You can't do this.

20:03.580 --> 20:05.810
- Kiss me.
- No, thank you.

20:09.110 --> 20:12.450
Well, Charlie, looks like
my reporting career.

20:12.480 --> 20:14.790
Has hit a little bump in the road.

20:17.360 --> 20:19.360
Oh, my feet are killing me.

20:21.090 --> 20:23.760
Mom, why did you wear your heels to work?

20:23.800 --> 20:28.230
Oh, they make everything an event.

20:28.270 --> 20:30.500
Oh. The store wouldn't
take them back, huh?

20:30.540 --> 20:32.970
Laughed in my face.

20:33.010 --> 20:35.340
See, this is a good lesson, Charlie.

20:35.370 --> 20:36.840
If you try to pull a scam,

20:36.880 --> 20:38.680
You're going to suffer the consequences.

20:38.710 --> 20:40.040
Here here, give me that camera.

20:40.080 --> 20:41.850
No, mom, I'll do
the video diary, thank you.

20:41.880 --> 20:44.180
No no no no. I've got something
I'd like to say to Charlie.

20:44.220 --> 20:46.820
Stay out of my closet, all right?

20:46.850 --> 20:49.750
Yeah? Next time you take
a pair of my shoes...

20:49.790 --> 20:52.690
You can take it from here.

20:52.730 --> 20:54.120
Good luck, Charlie.

20:59.580 --> 21:02.220
Good evening and welcome to
"gabe and Jake at the movies."

21:02.250 --> 21:03.720
I'm Gabe...

21:03.750 --> 21:06.720
This popcorn makes my fingers shiny.

21:08.820 --> 21:10.460
...And that's Jake.

21:10.490 --> 21:14.130
The first movie we're reviewing
tonight is "fishy friendz."

21:14.160 --> 21:16.730
Now I found it familiar and tired,

21:16.770 --> 21:19.100
Nothing I hadn't seen 100 times before.

21:19.130 --> 21:22.700
- Jake?
- It was awesome!

21:22.740 --> 21:25.210
That's what you say about every movie.

21:25.240 --> 21:27.540
Because I like every movie.

21:27.580 --> 21:30.080
Then what's the point of doing this show?

21:30.110 --> 21:32.710
Free popcorn.

21:33.120 --> 21:35.300
- You're an idiot.
- You're the idiot.

21:35.310 --> 21:37.290
- Am not!
- Are so!

21:37.290 --> 21:39.160
That's all the time we have for this week.

21:39.160 --> 21:42.580
See the next time on: Gabe at the movies.
