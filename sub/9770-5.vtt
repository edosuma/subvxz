02:43.746 --> 02:45.248

a little robot?

02:45.331 --> 02:46.249

02:46.332 --> 02:47.041

02:47.125 --> 02:47.917
'cause you can't.

02:48.001 --> 02:51.004

[laughter]

02:51.087 --> 02:52.338

02:52.422 --> 02:54.465
- All right, let's just go
sit down now.

02:54.549 --> 02:56.426
- No. My friends and I
could build a robot

02:56.509 --> 02:58.261
that could crush
your robot.

02:58.344 --> 02:59.762

02:59.846 --> 03:01.556

Hold on, hold on.

03:01.639 --> 03:06.019

that you want to challenge us

03:06.102 --> 03:07.478

03:07.562 --> 03:09.439

03:13.151 --> 03:13.860

03:13.943 --> 03:16.112
- Fine.
It's O-N.

03:16.195 --> 03:18.573
- One week from today,
our robot will fight your robot.

03:18.656 --> 03:21.242
- In the PCA amphitheater
after school.

03:21.326 --> 03:22.160

03:22.243 --> 03:23.745

03:23.828 --> 03:27.540

and guidelines will apply.

03:33.421 --> 03:35.882
- Okay, what else do you think
our robot should have?

03:35.965 --> 03:37.634
- I think it should
breathe fire.

03:37.717 --> 03:40.887
- Fire-breathing.
Okay.

03:40.970 --> 03:43.556
- And it should be able
to shoot heat-seeking missiles.

03:43.640 --> 03:45.308
- Heat-seeking missiles.

03:45.391 --> 03:46.726
- Ooh!

03:46.809 --> 03:48.811
We should rig it up
with a microphone and a speaker

03:48.895 --> 03:50.980
so we can talk smack
to the other robot.

03:51.064 --> 03:53.107
- Okay, speaker...

03:54.233 --> 03:56.069
microphone...

03:56.152 --> 03:57.695
smack.

03:57.779 --> 04:00.281
- Hey, what are we gonna call
our bot?

04:00.365 --> 04:01.074
- Let's call it
the Logan-ator.

04:01.157 --> 04:02.450
- Okay, why are you here again?

04:02.533 --> 04:05.161
- Well, someone's got to pay
for the bot.

04:05.244 --> 04:05.954
- And since I'm paying,
we're calling it

04:06.037 --> 04:08.998
"the Logan-ator."

04:09.082 --> 04:09.958
- Fine.

04:10.041 --> 04:11.960
Lola, let's see
the Logan-ator.

04:15.380 --> 04:17.130

- Man,

04:17.214 --> 04:19.257
we are gonna destroy
those science club geeks

04:19.341 --> 04:20.259
with that bot.

04:20.343 --> 04:21.886
- Yeah,
just one little problem.

04:21.970 --> 04:22.845
- What?

04:22.929 --> 04:23.346
- None of us knows
how to build it.

04:33.189 --> 04:34.065
- Hey, Quinn.

04:34.148 --> 04:35.358
Whatcha doing there?

04:35.441 --> 04:37.777
- I'm just making sure
my lunch is clean.

04:37.860 --> 04:39.779
People don't always wash lettuce
as well as they should.

04:39.862 --> 04:42.865
What's up?

04:42.949 --> 04:45.535
- Well, I was wondering
if you'd wanna help us

04:45.618 --> 04:47.286
with a little project.

04:47.370 --> 04:48.955
- Well, what's the project?

04:49.038 --> 04:50.540
- Well, see, we're building
this remote-control robot

04:50.623 --> 04:51.874
that we're gonna use
to fight against--

04:51.958 --> 04:53.334
- Oh, sorry,
I can't help you.

04:53.418 --> 04:56.629
- But you just said
you would love to help.

05:00.675 --> 05:05.221
- I really would like to help,
but I just don't believe

05:05.304 --> 05:07.598
in using my gift of science
for violence.

05:07.682 --> 05:08.933
- Oh, come on,
it's not really violence.

05:09.017 --> 05:10.560
Think of it more like--

05:10.643 --> 05:15.690

crushing each other...

05:15.773 --> 05:16.816

05:17.984 --> 05:18.943
- Sorry.

05:19.027 --> 05:21.154

right about it.

You'd just slow me down.

07:12.348 --> 07:13.724
- You know, I don't think
our bot looks

07:13.808 --> 07:15.726
intimidating enough.
- Yeah, it needs

07:15.810 --> 07:17.019
a big ol' mohawk,
like this high.

07:17.103 --> 07:20.064
That'll really kick up
the intimidation factor.

07:20.148 --> 07:22.525
- Uh, according
to the inter-scholastic war bot

07:22.608 --> 07:23.943

the height of a bot

07:24.026 --> 07:26.696

08:56.452 --> 08:57.912
It's what he does.

09:00.331 --> 09:02.625
- I expect to be made fun of
by Logan,

09:02.708 --> 09:05.419
but what I didn't expect was
for everyone to laugh...

09:05.503 --> 09:07.171
especially you.

09:07.255 --> 09:08.965
I thought you were my friend.

09:09.048 --> 09:11.509
- I am.
Sometimes friends make mistakes.

09:11.592 --> 09:11.676
- Clearly.

09:14.053 --> 09:14.929
- Quinn, will you please

09:15.012 --> 09:16.514
come down to the lounge with me?

09:16.597 --> 09:17.515
<i>QUINN: You don't want me,</i>

electrify this doorknob?

09:27.316 --> 09:28.734

09:28.818 --> 09:30.736

09:30.820 --> 09:32.321
- No, thanks.
I'm good.

09:37.994 --> 09:40.496
- I feel so bad
about Quinn.

09:40.579 --> 09:42.999
- We just got to apologize,
like, a thousand more times,

09:43.082 --> 09:44.750
and she'll be okay
in a week or two.

09:44.834 --> 09:46.252
- Guess we can forget about
beating those science geeks.

09:46.335 --> 09:49.880
- Yeah, I'll just have to
tell them we're forfeiting.

09:49.964 --> 09:51.674
CHASE: Hey, guys!

09:51.757 --> 09:53.175
You better come see this.

09:53.259 --> 09:54.176

09:54.260 --> 09:55.511

We can't quit now.

11:16.300 --> 11:18.177
- We have to.

11:18.260 --> 11:19.720
Other than those science geeks,

11:19.804 --> 11:21.931
Quinn's the only one that can
finish building our bot.

11:22.014 --> 11:23.057
- No, she's not.

11:23.140 --> 11:25.267
I think we need

11:25.351 --> 11:27.478
to pay a little visit
to Miles Brody.

11:27.561 --> 11:28.771
- Who's Miles Brody?

11:28.854 --> 11:32.817
- The number one smartest guy
at PCA ever.

11:32.900 --> 11:34.443
- Well,
where do we find him?

11:34.527 --> 11:34.819
- That's easy.

12:01.804 --> 12:02.721
- Hello.

12:02.805 --> 12:05.057
- Hey, Miles.
Um, listen,

12:05.141 --> 12:06.475
sorry to bug you, but--

12:06.559 --> 12:09.645
- Please, allow me to finish
my book before we speak.

12:17.194 --> 12:19.447
My book is done.

12:20.239 --> 12:22.116
- So, um, my name's--

12:22.199 --> 12:24.660
- Your name is Zoey Brooks.

12:24.743 --> 12:25.870
- Yeah.
How did you know--

12:25.953 --> 12:27.455
- Your dormitory is
Brenner Hall.

12:27.538 --> 12:28.581
You were born
in the South,

12:28.664 --> 12:30.416
specifically,
a small town in Louisiana

12:30.499 --> 12:32.418
who's name I know,
but it's not significant

12:32.501 --> 12:34.170
so I'll keep it to myself.

12:34.253 --> 12:36.338
You enjoy athletics,
e.g. basketball,

12:36.422 --> 12:38.924
and you maintain
a 3.85 grade point average.

12:39.008 --> 12:41.093
Impressive to most.

12:43.345 --> 12:45.306
- I told ya.
He knows everything.

12:45.389 --> 12:47.016
- Is this about your bot fight?

12:47.099 --> 12:48.684
I assume I'm correct.
Am I?

12:48.767 --> 12:49.685
- What, are you,
like, psychic or something?

12:49.768 --> 12:52.438
- Sadly, there is
no such ability.

12:52.521 --> 12:54.940
Though you're cute
to assume such.

12:55.024 --> 12:57.234
- So, how'd you know
about the bot war?

12:57.318 --> 12:58.861
- This entire school
has been made aware

12:58.944 --> 13:00.905
of your looming robot battle,
and the involvement

13:00.988 --> 13:03.491
of one Miss Zoey Brooks.
- Yeah, but--

13:03.574 --> 13:04.700
- Then a girl approaches me
with a key 'round her neck

13:04.783 --> 13:06.911
bearing the letter "z,"
a Z as in Zoey,

13:06.994 --> 13:09.705
and since I'm familiar
with the abilities

13:09.788 --> 13:12.249
of PCA's fine science club,
and since you are amateurs,

13:12.333 --> 13:13.584
I imagine at this point
you're growing nervous

13:13.667 --> 13:15.794
of your impending battle,
so you've come to me

13:15.878 --> 13:18.088
for advice and/or assistance,
am I correct?

13:18.464 --> 13:20.007
- Um...

13:20.090 --> 13:21.550
I just want you
to help us.

13:21.634 --> 13:22.718
Will ya?

13:24.720 --> 13:25.763
- Yes. I will.

13:25.846 --> 13:26.889
- Really?!

13:26.972 --> 13:28.849
- On one condition.

13:28.933 --> 13:29.892
- Sure, what?
Just tell me.

13:32.394 --> 13:34.104
- Make them go away first.

13:39.652 --> 13:41.529
- Okay,
what's your condition?

13:42.655 --> 13:44.490
- I'll help you
with your robot,

13:44.573 --> 13:46.075
but in return,

13:46.158 --> 13:47.618
I would like a date.

13:47.701 --> 13:50.120
- Oh. Well,
I'm flattered and all, but--

13:50.204 --> 13:51.539
- Not with you.

13:52.331 --> 13:54.959
With your delightful friend,

13:55.042 --> 13:57.461
the perky brunette
in the fuchsia blouse.

14:01.924 --> 14:04.468
- I can't promise you
a date with Nicole.

14:04.552 --> 14:06.595
- How unfortunate.

14:06.679 --> 14:07.721
- Look, can't we just...

14:07.805 --> 14:10.558
buy you
a big dictionary or something?

14:10.641 --> 14:11.350
- You know what I want.

14:11.433 --> 14:13.435
And I will not settle for less.

14:13.519 --> 14:14.770
You want my help
with your bot?

14:14.853 --> 14:15.854
Then guarantee me
a date with your friend.

14:21.819 --> 14:22.903
- Okay.

14:22.987 --> 14:24.280
If you help us with our bot,

14:24.363 --> 14:26.740
I promise you
a date with Nicole.

14:26.824 --> 14:28.325
- Fabulous.

14:52.433 --> 14:53.642
- Well?

14:53.726 --> 14:54.643
- Your bot is completed

14:54.727 --> 14:56.854
your directions
and specifications.

Now, who will be your operator?

15:03.819 --> 15:05.821
- Ummm...

15:05.904 --> 15:07.406

my date with your friend
Nicole.

15:29.428 --> 15:30.387
Tomorrow night.

15:30.471 --> 15:32.431
- I won't.

15:32.514 --> 15:34.475
You just...
be ready.

15:34.558 --> 15:37.561
- I shall bathe like I've never
bathed before.
