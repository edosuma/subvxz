Jess... ica...

00:11.679 --> 00:13.614
Jessica...

00:13.647 --> 00:15.683
( echoing ):
Over here... over here...

VARIOUS VOICES:
He's dead...HeHe'she
Your fiance's dead...

00:20.254 --> 00:21.722
I'm gonna get you...

00:21.755 --> 00:24.758
( voices whispering
indistinctly )

00:24.792 --> 00:27.795
I'm over here... Over here...
Here I am...

00:32.533 --> 00:33.234

Thirteen...

01:26.254 --> 01:28.256
Seventeen...

01:28.289 --> 01:29.523
Nineteen...

01:29.557 --> 01:31.225
Did you lose something
down there, DiNozzo?

01:31.259 --> 01:32.860
Ninety-nine...

01:32.893 --> 01:34.195
a hundred.

01:34.228 --> 01:36.364
Just doing
my morning exercise.

01:36.397 --> 01:38.299
Right.

01:38.332 --> 01:39.333
So how old's this one?

01:39.367 --> 01:41.669
Why does it always have
to be about a woman, Kate?

01:41.702 --> 01:43.604
Uh, 'cause we're
talking about you.

01:45.673 --> 01:47.308
Got your favorite here:

01:47.341 --> 01:50.544
bacon-sausage-cheese
breakfast burrito

01:51.512 --> 01:53.247
I'll pass.
Too much fat.

01:53.281 --> 01:54.748
Must be really young.

01:54.782 --> 01:56.250
ABBY:
Oh, she is.

01:56.284 --> 01:57.685
I don't think
they need to know
about it, Abbs.

01:57.718 --> 01:59.287
She's, um, five-ten,

01:59.320 --> 01:59.620
blonde hair,

01:59.653 --> 02:01.255
long legs

02:01.289 --> 02:02.890
and gi-normous headlights.

02:02.923 --> 02:04.758
The last part
was really necessary?

02:04.792 --> 02:06.360
That's what you called them.

02:06.394 --> 02:08.462
She broke down
by the Navy Yard
last night,

02:08.496 --> 02:10.431
and Tony helped
her out.

02:10.464 --> 02:11.732
Oh, I bet he did.

02:11.765 --> 02:13.301
She's a junior at Georgetown.

02:13.334 --> 02:15.403
Hmm, so that would make her
what, about 20?

02:15.436 --> 02:16.604
Actually,
she could be younger.

02:16.637 --> 02:18.772
I was 18
when I was a junior at MIT.

02:18.806 --> 02:19.640
When we need clarification

02:19.673 --> 02:21.275
we'll ask for it, probie.
Thank you.

02:21.309 --> 02:21.942
Oh, I'm asking.

02:21.975 --> 02:23.577
How old, Abby?

02:23.611 --> 02:25.446
Well, she's old enough
to turn Tony down.

02:25.479 --> 02:28.216
Said she only goes out
with guys in their 20s.

02:28.249 --> 02:28.849
Oh, poor baby.

02:28.882 --> 02:30.451
She wasn't my type anyway.

02:30.484 --> 02:31.485
KATE:
Well, that's a good thing,

02:31.519 --> 02:33.454
'cause I think it's time that

02:33.487 --> 02:35.623
the "Sex Machine"
hung his spurs up.

02:35.656 --> 02:36.957
How do you know about that?

02:36.990 --> 02:38.259
Your college nickname?

02:38.292 --> 02:39.327
Let's just say

02:39.360 --> 02:40.561
that dating
your frat brother

02:40.594 --> 02:41.562
had its advantages.

02:41.595 --> 02:42.530
GIBBS:
Grab your gear.

02:42.563 --> 02:43.664
Going to Georgetown.

02:43.697 --> 02:45.399
Petty officer
was assaulted

02:45.433 --> 02:46.300
in her home last night.

02:46.334 --> 02:47.401
You're driving...

02:48.336 --> 02:49.437
...Sex Machine.

02:51.672 --> 02:52.440
( laughs )

02:54.408 --> 02:55.676
Kate,

02:55.709 --> 02:56.844
I'd check you e-mail
before we go.

02:56.877 --> 02:57.711
It's kind of important.

03:04.985 --> 03:06.387
Where did you get this?

03:06.420 --> 03:07.421
Wet T-Shirt Wall
of Fame.

03:07.455 --> 03:08.356
Spring break '94.

03:08.389 --> 03:09.857
Saw it when I was in
Panama City last month.

03:09.890 --> 03:10.858
Oh, my God.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.393
I was going
to keep it to myself,

03:12.426 --> 03:14.628
but then you decided
to tell everyone my pledge name.

03:14.662 --> 03:15.496
You wouldn't dare!

03:15.529 --> 03:17.698
Oh.

03:18.632 --> 03:19.667
Tony,

03:19.700 --> 03:20.934
Tony, come on.

03:20.968 --> 03:22.135
We can work this out.

03:26.006 --> 03:30.411
OFFICER:
Name's Petty Officer
Jessica Smith.

03:30.444 --> 03:31.879
Claims intruder
in military fatigues

03:31.912 --> 03:33.581
entered her home
and tried to attack her.

03:33.614 --> 03:35.249
What do you
mean, "tried"?

03:35.283 --> 03:36.183
At this point,

03:36.216 --> 03:38.586
I'm not even sure
there was an attacker.

03:43.324 --> 03:44.658
Who are you?

03:44.692 --> 03:48.529
Special Agents Gibbs
and Todd.

03:48.562 --> 03:50.764
NCIS.

03:55.469 --> 03:56.637
We have to talk,

03:56.670 --> 03:58.772
but not here.

03:58.806 --> 04:02.643
They're listening.

04:02.676 --> 04:05.379
Who's listening, Petty Officer?

04:05.413 --> 04:07.681
I wish I knew.

04:09.750 --> 04:10.818
Turn the radio on.

04:13.487 --> 04:14.822
( music playing )

04:14.855 --> 04:18.759
All right, they can't
hear us now.

04:18.792 --> 04:20.528
Tell me about last night.

04:23.364 --> 04:25.633
How do I know
I can trust you?

04:25.666 --> 04:28.469
Because we're here
to help.

04:31.405 --> 04:33.674
I heard voices...

04:33.707 --> 04:34.708
whispering.

04:34.742 --> 04:36.310
Yeah? Saying what?

04:36.344 --> 04:38.579
I couldn't tell,
but it was about me.

04:38.612 --> 04:41.482
You have to protect me.

04:41.515 --> 04:43.351
From what?

04:43.384 --> 04:46.053
Monsters.

04:46.086 --> 04:48.589
Jessica,
it's going to be okay.

04:48.622 --> 04:50.724
Boss, the commander
refused to wait outside.

04:50.758 --> 04:52.393
Lieutenant Commander
Allan Witten.

04:52.426 --> 04:55.028
I'm Petty Officer Smith's
psychologist.

04:55.062 --> 04:56.330
( whimpering )

04:57.898 --> 04:58.766
Outside,

04:58.799 --> 04:59.733
Now.

04:59.767 --> 05:02.436
Very well.

05:02.470 --> 05:04.772
I don't want to go back!
I can't go back!

05:04.805 --> 05:06.640
Please tell me
I won't go back!

05:09.810 --> 05:12.112
WITTEN:
Jessica is under my care.

05:12.145 --> 05:14.748
When she missed her phone
session this morning,

05:14.782 --> 05:15.849
I became concerned.

05:15.883 --> 05:17.651
What's wrong
with her?

05:17.685 --> 05:19.720
She's been diagnosed
with "Brief Reactive Psychosis."

05:19.753 --> 05:22.089
We believe it's been triggered
by the death of her fiance

05:22.122 --> 05:22.923
in Iraq last month.

05:22.956 --> 05:26.059
Yeah? Why isn't she
in the hospital?

05:26.093 --> 05:28.762
As her condition improved,
we released her.

05:28.796 --> 05:30.464
Treated her as an out-patient.

05:30.498 --> 05:32.766
She told the cops
there was a man
in her bedroom

05:32.800 --> 05:34.668
in camouflage
utilities and
body armor.

05:34.702 --> 05:37.705
Was she hearing voices
and did he have a knife?

05:40.708 --> 05:42.643
How do you know that,
Commander?

05:42.676 --> 05:44.144
It's a delusion, Agent Gibbs.

05:44.177 --> 05:45.379
She's had several

05:45.413 --> 05:47.448
just like it at
Bethesda.

05:47.481 --> 05:49.383
I need to get her back.

05:50.851 --> 05:52.152
Gentlemen, I assure you

05:52.185 --> 05:54.555
no crime has been committed
here.

05:54.588 --> 05:57.991
Why don't you let me
decide that?

06:00.060 --> 06:01.895
I'm very, very sorry

06:01.929 --> 06:05.032
for the "Sex Machine"
crack, Tony.

06:05.065 --> 06:07.735
It was insensitive and rude.

06:07.768 --> 06:08.802
I swear it
won't happen again.

06:08.836 --> 06:09.937
Whatever.

06:09.970 --> 06:12.673
Damn it, what are you
going to do with it, DiNozzo?

06:12.706 --> 06:14.074
I haven't
decided yet.

06:14.107 --> 06:16.176
I thought it might make
a nice poster.

06:16.209 --> 06:18.111
What would?

06:18.145 --> 06:19.747
I am warning you.

06:19.780 --> 06:21.081
It will be war.

06:21.114 --> 06:22.850
Hell on Earth.

06:22.883 --> 06:23.584
What are you guys
talking about?

06:23.617 --> 06:24.785
BOTH:
None of your business,

06:24.818 --> 06:25.786
MacGee.
Probie.

06:26.454 --> 06:28.589
Petty Officer Smith
say anything

06:28.622 --> 06:30.190
while I was talking
to her shrink?

06:30.223 --> 06:32.092
No. All she kept
telling me

06:32.125 --> 06:32.926
was to call her CO

06:32.960 --> 06:34.795
and to let him know
that the monsters

06:34.828 --> 06:35.929
are after her again.

06:35.963 --> 06:37.565
From all appearances,

06:37.598 --> 06:39.767
I'd say she had a relapse.

06:39.800 --> 06:43.837
Well, my first two marriages
were based on appearances.

06:43.871 --> 06:46.740
Pull Petty Officer Smith's
records when we get back.

06:51.879 --> 06:53.046
KATE:
Navy Achievement medal winner,

06:53.080 --> 06:53.914
Sailor of the Quarter
three times.

06:53.947 --> 06:55.783
She is an outstanding
sailor, Gibbs.

06:55.816 --> 06:58.085
Lot of overachievers
and perfectionists lose it.

06:58.118 --> 07:00.721
My uncle ran a Fortune 500
company until they found him

07:00.754 --> 07:01.589
digging up holes

07:01.622 --> 07:03.891
in a golf course
looking for mole people.

07:03.924 --> 07:06.026
You're a perfectionist,
aren't you, Kate?

07:06.059 --> 07:07.761
Before her breakdown

07:07.795 --> 07:09.497
she was working for the
Department of Acquisitions

07:09.530 --> 07:10.531
at the Pentagon.

07:10.564 --> 07:11.799
Who's her CO?

07:11.832 --> 07:14.602
Captain Ross Vetter.

07:14.635 --> 07:16.036
There's an open case file
on him, boss.

07:16.069 --> 07:18.539
Why don't I know about it?

07:18.572 --> 07:19.607
It's not ours.
It's the FBI's.

07:19.640 --> 07:20.440
They opened it
about a month

07:20.474 --> 07:22.075
before Smith had
her psychotic break.

07:22.109 --> 07:24.144
What are they investigating
Vetter for?

07:24.177 --> 07:25.245
I can't tell.

07:25.278 --> 07:27.515
They're not letting NCIS

07:27.548 --> 07:29.517
access the contents
of the file.

07:29.550 --> 07:30.250
McGee.

07:30.283 --> 07:31.985
You want the FBI's case file

07:32.019 --> 07:33.787
on Captain Vetter. On it.

07:33.821 --> 07:34.922
Let's roll.

07:34.955 --> 07:35.923
Where to?

07:35.956 --> 07:37.057
To ask Petty Officer Smith

07:37.090 --> 07:38.859
some questions about monsters.

07:43.631 --> 07:45.499
Hi, I'm Catherine Reynolds.

07:45.533 --> 07:46.734
We've been expecting you.

07:46.767 --> 07:47.601
Welcome to Seven West.

07:47.635 --> 07:50.070
Commander Witten
is on his way down now.

07:50.103 --> 07:52.673
I can tell you
everything there is

07:52.706 --> 07:53.874
to know about this place.

07:53.907 --> 07:55.509
They don't need
to know anything,
William.

07:55.543 --> 07:57.845
All you have to do
is ask me.

07:57.878 --> 08:00.781
Who's got the power,
who's cool...

08:00.814 --> 08:01.815
( chuckles )

08:01.849 --> 08:03.817
...who's got
the baby oil.

08:03.851 --> 08:04.818
That's enough
now, William.

08:04.852 --> 08:05.919
Go back to group. Go.

08:05.953 --> 08:07.621
( chuckles )

08:07.655 --> 08:09.790
Oh, here's Commander Witten now.

08:09.823 --> 08:11.692
Kate, you're with me.

08:11.725 --> 08:12.693
Uh,

08:12.726 --> 08:14.562
boss, what about me?

08:14.595 --> 08:17.698
Conflict in the
workplace?

08:17.731 --> 08:19.266
You have no idea.

08:19.299 --> 08:20.267
I have a theory

08:20.300 --> 08:21.902
that most
of it results

08:21.935 --> 08:23.036
from unresolved sexual issues.

08:23.070 --> 08:23.871
Really?

08:23.904 --> 08:27.274
It certainly
has been the
case for me.

08:28.909 --> 08:30.911
I could use
a drink.

08:30.944 --> 08:32.646
How about you?

08:32.680 --> 08:34.648
Mrs. Reynolds,
did you get that shirt

08:34.682 --> 08:36.016
out of the laundry room?

08:36.049 --> 08:38.018
The doctors warned you
about this kind of behavior.

08:38.051 --> 08:40.954
Well, the doctor
doesn't have an ass
like this one.

08:40.988 --> 08:43.156
Sorry. I can't help
myself sometimes.

08:48.629 --> 08:50.230
She's been sedated.

08:50.263 --> 08:51.999
She'll sleep
through the night.

08:52.032 --> 08:53.867
I want to talk to her
when she wakes up.

08:53.901 --> 08:56.036
Absolutely not.

08:56.069 --> 08:57.605
She's paranoid
of authority figures.

08:57.638 --> 08:58.872
From what I've seen,

08:58.906 --> 09:02.009
the only one
she seems paranoid
about is you.

09:02.042 --> 09:03.276
She had a delusional
episode.

09:03.310 --> 09:07.314
This has nothing
to do with NCIS.

09:07.347 --> 09:08.749
You can check back
in a few weeks.

09:09.983 --> 09:11.284
We'll see you tomorrow.

09:12.886 --> 09:15.656
I have a degree
in clinical psychology.

09:15.689 --> 09:17.758
Do you have any expertise

09:17.791 --> 09:18.992
in the area, Agent Gibbs?

09:19.026 --> 09:21.762
No. No, I do not.

09:21.795 --> 09:22.963
Just a BS meter.

09:22.996 --> 09:25.933
See you in the morning, Doc.

09:30.704 --> 09:32.139
The FBI's stonewalling us, boss.

09:32.172 --> 09:34.007
They claim that
the Captain Vetter
case is classified.

09:34.041 --> 09:35.142
Last time I checked,

09:35.175 --> 09:37.277
we had clearances, probie.

09:37.310 --> 09:38.879
Well, they're still not
releasing the info, Tony,

09:38.912 --> 09:41.014
but I, uh, I did call
the Pentagon.

09:41.048 --> 09:44.284
I spoke with the admiral
in charge of his office.

09:44.317 --> 09:48.856
The FBI thinks that
Captain Vetter

09:48.889 --> 09:51.892
was taking kickbacks in exchange
for government contracts.

09:51.925 --> 09:52.793
He's on administrative leave

09:52.826 --> 09:54.828
pending the outcome
of the investigation.

09:54.862 --> 09:55.863
They say anything

09:55.896 --> 09:57.064
about Petty Officer
Jessica Smith?

09:57.097 --> 09:57.998
Yes. She was questioned,

09:58.031 --> 10:00.200
but so was
everybody else
in Vetter's group.

10:00.233 --> 10:02.736
Well, if she was found
mentally ill,

10:02.770 --> 10:03.536
it would excuse her

10:03.570 --> 10:04.304
from testifying
against her boss.

10:04.337 --> 10:05.005
She didn't look

10:05.038 --> 10:06.039
like she was faking
it to me.

10:06.073 --> 10:06.940
Something tells me

10:06.974 --> 10:08.008
you say that a lot.

10:08.041 --> 10:11.912
Kate, when they pour
cold water over your chest,

10:11.945 --> 10:12.980
doesn't that sort of
make you...?

10:13.013 --> 10:15.048
Hey, DiNozzo!

10:15.082 --> 10:17.017
You do that again,

10:17.050 --> 10:19.853
I will put my boot
so far up your ass...

10:19.887 --> 10:21.121
Yeah. Gibbs.

10:21.154 --> 10:22.255
Agent Gibbs,

10:22.289 --> 10:27.160
I should have told you before--
we have to talk, sir.

10:27.194 --> 10:29.062
Yeah, yeah, I'm listening.

10:29.096 --> 10:31.298
Not like this.

10:31.331 --> 10:32.933
They're listening.

10:32.966 --> 10:34.067
You got to help me.

10:34.101 --> 10:36.036
Yeah, all right.
We're on our way.

10:36.069 --> 10:36.837
Hurry, please?

10:36.870 --> 10:39.172
Jessica, stay on the phone
with me.

10:39.206 --> 10:41.208
You just keep talking
to me, Jessica.

10:41.241 --> 10:43.744
I can't. Just get here.

10:43.777 --> 10:45.746
Kate, come on.
You're with me.

10:48.949 --> 10:50.083
Jessica Smith's room?

10:50.117 --> 10:50.951
Sir, I'm not authorized.

10:50.984 --> 10:51.752
Commander Witten told me...

10:51.785 --> 10:53.020
Open her door

10:53.053 --> 10:54.755
or I'll break it down!

10:54.788 --> 10:55.989
Yes, sir.

11:19.880 --> 11:20.814
Find out who else she called.

11:20.848 --> 11:22.983
Check out her speed dial
and her phone book.

11:23.016 --> 11:23.984
On it.

11:24.017 --> 11:24.985
She should've been observed

11:25.018 --> 11:26.119
24 hours a day,

11:26.153 --> 11:27.354
Jethro.

11:27.387 --> 11:29.189
A young, troubled girl
being left alone all night

11:29.222 --> 11:31.024
is negligent
at best.

11:31.058 --> 11:33.160
WITTEN:
My God.

11:33.193 --> 11:35.328
Did she leave a note?

11:35.362 --> 11:37.164
No.

11:37.197 --> 11:39.699
GIBBS:
If she did, what would
she have written?

11:42.035 --> 11:45.372
I don't know.

11:45.405 --> 11:49.076
He was the one responsible
for the Petty Officer.

11:49.109 --> 11:51.111
Easy, Duck.

11:51.144 --> 11:53.080
Commander.

11:53.113 --> 11:55.248
How could you have
allowed this young woman

11:55.282 --> 11:56.817
to be left
alone all night?

11:56.850 --> 11:59.252
There was a
corpsman on duty.

11:59.286 --> 12:01.822
One corpsman for
an entire ward?

12:01.855 --> 12:03.323
We had seven patients.

12:03.356 --> 12:05.893
None were considered
suicide risks.

12:05.926 --> 12:09.329
I'm sure the family will take
great solace from that.

12:12.165 --> 12:14.868
She's ready,
Dr. Mallard.

12:17.905 --> 12:19.940
( sighs )

12:19.973 --> 12:22.042
Let's get her home,
Mr. Palmer.

12:25.245 --> 12:26.814
What's going on?

12:26.847 --> 12:28.315
Jessica
killed herself.

12:28.348 --> 12:28.882
I heard them say it.

12:28.916 --> 12:29.917
She's deader than dead.

12:29.950 --> 12:32.085
Is it true?

12:32.119 --> 12:34.187
I'm afraid so, Catherine.

12:40.160 --> 12:41.361
WITTEN:
Corpsman,

12:41.394 --> 12:42.963
can we get everyone

12:42.996 --> 12:44.297
into the day room, please.
Yes, sir.

12:44.331 --> 12:46.233
Come on, William.
It's okay.

12:46.266 --> 12:48.235
It's okay...

12:48.268 --> 12:49.369
I take it you knew her well?

12:51.538 --> 12:53.506
We spent a month
together here.

12:53.540 --> 12:56.810
It's about as good
a chick-bonding
experience as any.

12:56.844 --> 12:57.911
Ah...

12:57.945 --> 13:00.180
It must be difficult.

13:00.213 --> 13:02.149
It's hard.

13:02.182 --> 13:03.416
Yeah, I know.

13:05.185 --> 13:07.287
Really, really hard,
Agent Tony.

13:08.255 --> 13:10.357
GIBBS:
If you're not too busy, DiNozzo.

13:11.391 --> 13:12.392
You're a shy

13:12.425 --> 13:14.227
little minx.

13:14.261 --> 13:15.295
Later.

13:16.997 --> 13:18.565
( Tony shudders )

13:21.301 --> 13:22.202
I didn't hear
anything, sir.

13:22.235 --> 13:24.137
Is this where you were
most of the night?

13:24.171 --> 13:26.173
Unless I was making my rounds.

13:26.206 --> 13:27.941
When's the last time you checked

13:27.975 --> 13:29.242
on Petty Officer Smith?

13:29.276 --> 13:30.110
1930, ma'am.

13:30.143 --> 13:32.545
She was sedated
and sleeping peacefully.

13:32.579 --> 13:35.849
If she was sedated,
how did she manage to call us?

13:35.883 --> 13:36.783
And hang herself?

13:36.816 --> 13:38.952
Ma'am, I've seen patients
kill themselves

13:38.986 --> 13:40.153
by stuffing their noses

13:40.187 --> 13:41.855
and throats full
of toilet paper.

13:41.889 --> 13:43.924
If they want to do it,
they find a way.

13:43.957 --> 13:45.959
Or they're helped.

13:45.993 --> 13:49.162
Who classified her
a non-suicide risk?

13:50.130 --> 13:52.165
Commander Witten, sir.

13:52.199 --> 13:54.067
All right.

13:54.101 --> 13:55.168
That's all for now.

13:55.202 --> 13:57.404
Yes, sir.

14:00.107 --> 14:01.274
Boss...

14:01.308 --> 14:02.642
finished processing
the room.

14:02.675 --> 14:04.011
Okay to tape
it off now?

14:04.044 --> 14:05.913
Yeah, go ahead, do it.

14:05.946 --> 14:08.115
I also want everything
on Witten.

14:08.148 --> 14:10.317
Every contact he's had
with Petty Officer Smith.

14:10.350 --> 14:12.085
Tonight?

14:14.421 --> 14:16.389
Oh, I'll get right on it.

14:17.424 --> 14:19.092
What about doctor-patient
confidentiality?

14:19.126 --> 14:22.195
Doesn't exist in the military
anymore, probie.

14:22.229 --> 14:24.264
And sadly for some...

14:24.297 --> 14:26.166
doesn't exist between

14:26.199 --> 14:28.001
NCIS teammates either.

14:30.337 --> 14:32.205
You're wasting your time.

14:32.239 --> 14:34.107
Doesn't bother me anymore,
Tony.

14:34.141 --> 14:36.243
Probie, you want to see
something hot?

14:36.276 --> 14:37.911
Sure.

14:37.945 --> 14:39.612
What's it going
to cost me?

14:39.646 --> 14:41.248
I don't know.

14:41.281 --> 14:44.251
You still have that
Catholic schoolgirl uniform?

14:55.195 --> 14:57.197
Agent DiNozzo.

14:57.230 --> 14:59.032
I thought you were dead,
Fornell.

14:59.066 --> 15:00.467
I got better.

15:00.500 --> 15:03.303
Does Gibbs know you're
sitting at his desk?

15:03.336 --> 15:04.704
Just checking my e-mail.

15:04.737 --> 15:06.339
Don't think he'll mind.

15:07.340 --> 15:09.376
How long has
he been here?

15:09.409 --> 15:10.177
Since I got in.

15:14.247 --> 15:15.983
Isn't he supposed to be dead?

15:16.016 --> 15:17.317
TONY:
Got better.

15:17.350 --> 15:20.053
Does Gibbs know
he's sitting at his desk?

15:20.087 --> 15:21.388
No.

15:21.421 --> 15:22.255
Oh, this is going to be...

15:22.289 --> 15:23.290
Great.

15:24.391 --> 15:26.193
Comfortable?

15:26.226 --> 15:27.260
FORNELL:
Not really.

15:27.294 --> 15:28.295
There's no lumbar support.

15:29.496 --> 15:33.333
And you should get a password
to protect your computer.

15:33.366 --> 15:34.467
That's what

15:34.501 --> 15:36.703
this is for.

15:38.371 --> 15:39.672
What do you want, Tobias?

15:39.706 --> 15:40.573
I'm hurt.

15:40.607 --> 15:43.410
Can't an old friend just
stop by to say hi?

15:43.443 --> 15:45.312
Well, you are old,
I'll give you that.

15:45.345 --> 15:48.715
Our usual conference room?

15:48.748 --> 15:50.317
Lead the way.

15:52.352 --> 15:54.287
Hey, make sure he didn't do

15:54.321 --> 15:56.156
any of that virus
goat rope crap

15:56.189 --> 15:57.290
to my... my thing.

15:57.324 --> 15:59.259
Goat rope?

15:59.292 --> 16:00.560
Marine term,
probie.

16:00.593 --> 16:01.628
Means halfway

16:01.661 --> 16:03.630
between FUBAR and SNAFU.

16:03.663 --> 16:05.632
Okay, what's FUBAR?

16:06.666 --> 16:08.335
You are.
You are.

16:13.073 --> 16:16.309
Why is the FBI
investigating

16:16.343 --> 16:18.378
a Navy captain without
informing us, Fornell?

16:18.411 --> 16:19.679
I forgot.

16:19.712 --> 16:22.015
You always inform us
when one of your cases

16:22.049 --> 16:23.450
strays into
FBI jurisdiction.

16:23.483 --> 16:24.684
I want to know
about this case.

16:24.717 --> 16:28.121
We're looking at
a Captain Vetter
for taking kickbacks.

16:28.155 --> 16:30.490
You came all the way down here
to tell me that?

16:31.524 --> 16:33.326
That...

16:33.360 --> 16:35.495
and they want you to back off,
Jethro.

16:35.528 --> 16:36.329
( chuckles )

16:36.363 --> 16:37.464
Believe me--

16:37.497 --> 16:39.499
I told them it was futile.

16:39.532 --> 16:41.501
What does Petty Officer
Jessica Smith

16:41.534 --> 16:42.802
have to do with this?

16:42.835 --> 16:45.238
No idea. I'm just
the messenger here.

16:45.272 --> 16:47.407
Now why don't I believe that?

16:47.440 --> 16:48.341
( sighs )

16:48.375 --> 16:50.310
I'd say mostly because
you're a bastard.

16:50.343 --> 16:52.479
But it wouldn't do
any good, would it?

16:52.512 --> 16:55.348
I'll see what I can
find out for you.

16:55.382 --> 16:56.516
No promises.

16:57.584 --> 17:00.787
Tobias, you owe me.

17:00.820 --> 17:02.289
You're calling that in

17:02.322 --> 17:05.058
for a B-and-E on
some petty officer's house?

17:05.092 --> 17:06.426
She's dead.

17:06.459 --> 17:08.495
How?

17:08.528 --> 17:10.163
She killed herself last night.

17:10.197 --> 17:11.264
I want to know why.

17:12.765 --> 17:14.501
I'll find out.

17:14.534 --> 17:16.369
Under one condition.

17:16.403 --> 17:17.237
Name it.

17:17.270 --> 17:19.072
You don't do anything
to jeopardize

17:19.106 --> 17:20.473
our investigation
into Captain Vetter.

17:20.507 --> 17:22.475
I wouldn't dream of it.

17:22.509 --> 17:24.244
Why don't I believe that?

17:24.277 --> 17:26.346
Mostly...

17:26.779 --> 17:29.482
...because I'm a bastard.

17:32.752 --> 17:33.820
Hey, McGee.

17:33.853 --> 17:34.821
Boss.

17:34.854 --> 17:38.725
Get me the home address
of Captain Ross Vetter.

17:38.758 --> 17:40.760
And get the sedan.

17:42.829 --> 17:46.099
( doorbell ringing )

17:47.900 --> 17:50.170
What do you want?

17:50.203 --> 17:53.273
To hear your side
of the story.

17:54.574 --> 17:56.676
Off the record.

18:05.585 --> 18:07.787
I'm being railroaded.

18:07.820 --> 18:09.256
By who?

18:11.458 --> 18:14.827
The military industrial complex.

18:14.861 --> 18:16.463
I wouldn't play
their game.

18:16.496 --> 18:18.431
What kind of game
is that, Captain?

18:22.535 --> 18:24.304
Do you know how
defense contracts

18:24.337 --> 18:25.538
are decided in this country?

18:25.572 --> 18:28.208
Usually by
the lowest bidder.

18:28.241 --> 18:29.442
Every senator,

18:29.476 --> 18:30.577
every congressman,

18:30.610 --> 18:34.281
tries to grab a piece
of the pie for their own people.

18:34.314 --> 18:35.615
For their state.

18:35.648 --> 18:38.251
No-- the people,
the corporations

18:38.285 --> 18:40.187
that fund
their campaigns

18:40.220 --> 18:42.489
and that hire them
after they

18:42.522 --> 18:43.556
get out of office,
Agent McGee.

18:43.590 --> 18:46.693
You think that's why the FBI's
investigating you?

18:46.726 --> 18:47.927
I know it.

18:47.960 --> 18:49.696
I was trying
to change that system.

18:49.729 --> 18:51.298
And now I'm paying for it.

18:52.365 --> 18:53.700
Damn it!

18:55.335 --> 18:56.636
Sweetheart, Audrey,

18:56.669 --> 18:58.305
need some towels
out here.

18:58.338 --> 19:01.774
Kind of early for
the single malt,
isn't it, Skip?

19:03.610 --> 19:04.711
You have no idea

19:04.744 --> 19:07.480
what the last couple of months
have been like for me.

19:07.514 --> 19:08.648
For my family.

19:08.681 --> 19:09.549
No, I don't.

19:09.582 --> 19:11.651
But you don't know
what it's been like

19:11.684 --> 19:12.652
for Petty Officer Smith.

19:14.554 --> 19:16.556
I've been meaning
to visit her.

19:16.589 --> 19:17.724
A little late for that.

19:19.692 --> 19:21.894
Jessica Smith killed herself
last night, Captain.

19:25.998 --> 19:28.968
I knew she was having some...
issues

19:29.001 --> 19:31.604
when her fiance died, but...

19:31.638 --> 19:34.541
Do you know why?

19:34.574 --> 19:35.842
That's what we're hoping
to find out.

19:35.875 --> 19:37.910
WOMAN:
When are you people
going to leave us alone?

19:37.944 --> 19:40.680
That's all right, sweetheart,
they're NCIS agents.

19:40.713 --> 19:41.581
I don't care, Ross.

19:41.614 --> 19:42.982
I'm not answering
any more questions.

19:43.015 --> 19:44.551
I want them out of my home.

19:46.919 --> 19:49.856
I'm sorry to hear
about Jessica.

19:49.889 --> 19:51.858
She was like a daughter to me.

19:51.891 --> 19:53.993
I should have been
there for her.

19:54.026 --> 19:56.729
She wanted us to pass
a message along to
you, Captain.

19:58.265 --> 20:01.301
The monsters were
after her again.

20:01.334 --> 20:02.369
Monsters?

20:02.402 --> 20:03.536
I don't understand.

20:03.570 --> 20:06.539
We don't either... yet.

20:06.573 --> 20:07.907
If you think of anything

20:07.940 --> 20:11.778
that might help,
call me.

20:12.812 --> 20:14.547
Of course.

20:14.581 --> 20:16.015
Sorry to bother
you, ma'am.

20:16.048 --> 20:17.717
You have a beautiful home.

20:17.750 --> 20:19.552
When I was a Marine,
I could have never

20:19.586 --> 20:22.755
afforded a place
as nice as this.

20:27.527 --> 20:30.797
DUCKY:
She was right, Jethro.

20:30.830 --> 20:32.932
Monsters were after her.

20:32.965 --> 20:35.768
Hanging leaves a
telltale "V" mark
on the neck--

20:35.802 --> 20:37.470
here... and here.

20:37.504 --> 20:40.307
As you can see,
these marks

20:40.340 --> 20:42.041
are missing
from her neck.

20:42.074 --> 20:44.511
Also I found bruising
and clotting

20:44.544 --> 20:47.680
on the inside of her nose,
and on the inside of her lips.

20:47.714 --> 20:48.881
She was smothered.

20:48.915 --> 20:50.817
Yes. Poor girl was dead
long before

20:50.850 --> 20:52.952
the noose went anywhere
near her neck.

20:52.985 --> 20:56.723
This was no suicide,
Jethro.

20:56.756 --> 20:59.726
Our Petty Officer was murdered.

21:08.100 --> 21:10.437
KATE:
Look familiar, sex machine?

21:10.470 --> 21:13.673
( chuckles ):
Now that you
mention it...

21:13.706 --> 21:16.343
Nope, it's a different
style T-shirt. See?

21:16.376 --> 21:18.044
I'm begging you, don't.

21:18.077 --> 21:19.011
Gonna be nice?

21:19.045 --> 21:20.347
Yes.

21:20.380 --> 21:21.047
See what?

21:21.080 --> 21:22.515
Hi there, boss. Um...

21:23.450 --> 21:24.684
Just admiring
Abby's handiwork.

21:27.754 --> 21:28.921
Why?
ABBY:
Well,

21:28.955 --> 21:30.022
I was bored,
and I thought

21:30.056 --> 21:31.624
she needed a
little personality.

21:31.658 --> 21:33.726
Does she have
a purpose, Abby?

21:33.760 --> 21:34.594
ABBY:
Several, in fact.

21:34.627 --> 21:36.696
According to her
instruction manual.

21:36.729 --> 21:38.531
For the case, Abbs.

21:38.565 --> 21:39.732
Oh. Right.

21:39.766 --> 21:40.867
Um, I think I know how

21:40.900 --> 21:42.669
Petty Officer Smith
was strung up.

21:42.702 --> 21:44.671
According to her hospital chart,

21:44.704 --> 21:46.072
she was given

21:46.105 --> 21:47.507
15 milligrams of Trazodone

21:47.540 --> 21:48.575
when she arrived
at Bethesda.

21:48.608 --> 21:50.777
That's enough
to zonk her out
for most of the day.

21:50.810 --> 21:51.611
Then how did she make

21:51.644 --> 21:52.945
the phone call
asking us for help?

21:52.979 --> 21:55.047
Well, it would have
started to wear off.

21:55.081 --> 21:56.816
She would have been weak,

21:56.849 --> 21:59.619
sluggish--
at least enough for this.

22:01.421 --> 22:03.022
Except there were no signs
of struggle, Abby.

22:03.055 --> 22:04.991
Have you ever been
on Trazodone, Tony?

22:05.024 --> 22:06.793
I mean, she couldn't have
fought off a ten-year-old.

22:06.826 --> 22:07.994
But still there is a problem.

22:08.027 --> 22:09.829
How'd they hang
her afterwards.

22:09.862 --> 22:11.864
Correct as always,
my silver-haired fox.

22:12.965 --> 22:14.867
I mean, Gibbs, sir, boss.

22:20.807 --> 22:21.808
See what's missing?

22:21.841 --> 22:23.843
Nothing to stand on.
Exactly.

22:23.876 --> 22:26.713
How did the killer
lift her body afterwards?

22:26.746 --> 22:27.580
There were two of them?

22:27.614 --> 22:30.016
Possible.
But there's a simpler way.

22:33.753 --> 22:35.988
The legs of the bed
act as a fulcrum...

22:40.660 --> 22:43.463
...making it easier
for one person

22:43.496 --> 22:44.731
to lift Jessica's weight.

22:44.764 --> 22:46.433
That would've made some noise.

22:46.466 --> 22:47.366
Enough that you probably

22:47.400 --> 22:48.901
would've heard it
at the nurses' station.

22:48.935 --> 22:51.003
Manned by Corpsman Morgan.

22:52.071 --> 22:54.474
Have him report to NCIS
tomorrow.

22:54.507 --> 22:55.742
KATE:
Okay.
Don't tell him why.

22:58.945 --> 23:00.913
( elevator bell dings )

23:02.014 --> 23:03.583
KATE:
I saw that.

23:03.616 --> 23:05.618
Saw what?

23:05.652 --> 23:08.721
( sighs ):
Nothing.
I saw nothing.

23:12.091 --> 23:13.860
You want some of this?

23:13.893 --> 23:17.163
I got a clean cup
around here somewhere.

23:19.732 --> 23:22.068
I'm not worried about
your cups, Gibbs.

23:24.103 --> 23:26.005
How can you drink
that rotgut?

23:26.038 --> 23:28.475
Easy. It's got alcohol in it.

23:28.508 --> 23:32.178
Macallan 18.

23:33.212 --> 23:35.548
Now, there's a drink.
Hm.

23:35.582 --> 23:36.849
GIBBS:
What'd you find out about

23:36.883 --> 23:39.218
the FBI investigation
into Captain Vetter?

23:39.251 --> 23:41.588
Officially, not much.

23:41.621 --> 23:42.889
Unofficially?

23:42.922 --> 23:44.924
They weren't
getting very far,

23:44.957 --> 23:47.026
so they decided to go...

23:47.059 --> 23:49.161
for someone weaker
in his office.

23:49.195 --> 23:52.164
His personal assistant,
Petty Officer Smith.

23:52.198 --> 23:55.067
Why shut NCIS out of it?

23:55.101 --> 23:57.737
They worked her over
pretty hard.

23:57.770 --> 23:59.105
Didn't think
you'd go along with it.

23:59.138 --> 24:02.575
Threats, jail time.

24:02.609 --> 24:04.911
They forced her to
wear a wire to work.

24:06.579 --> 24:11.017
That woman just lost her fiance
in Iraq, Fornell.

24:11.050 --> 24:13.185
Which only made her
more vulnerable,

24:13.219 --> 24:14.721
easy to manipulate.

24:14.754 --> 24:18.090
Man, and you call me a bastard.

24:18.124 --> 24:20.660
Wasn't my case, Gibbs.

24:20.693 --> 24:23.095
I'm just here
doing a favor.

24:23.129 --> 24:24.964
That said,

24:24.997 --> 24:27.199
they think
she was hiding something.

24:27.233 --> 24:28.668
What?

24:28.701 --> 24:30.637
Unfortunately,
she killed herself

24:30.670 --> 24:32.238
before they could find out.

24:32.271 --> 24:34.273
Jessica Smith
did not commit suicide--

24:34.306 --> 24:36.909
she was murdered.

24:38.711 --> 24:40.046
By whom?

24:40.079 --> 24:42.849
That's a hell of a question,
Tobias.

24:42.882 --> 24:46.052
That's what
you're gonna help me find out.

24:55.161 --> 24:57.764
Book-on-tape club?

24:57.797 --> 24:59.832
Jessica Smith's
therapy sessions.

24:59.866 --> 25:01.133
Anything interesting?

25:01.167 --> 25:02.769
Well, not from
her psychologist,

25:02.802 --> 25:04.671
Commander Witten--
she's evasive, afraid

25:04.704 --> 25:05.905
to talk.
She's a little
more outgoing

25:05.938 --> 25:08.040
in the group sessions
but not by much.

25:08.074 --> 25:11.010
Is her friend
Catherine Reynolds on
those tapes, probie?

25:11.043 --> 25:13.145
Yes. Yes.

25:13.179 --> 25:15.682
Catherine Reynolds-- she is
the one that talks about sex,

25:15.715 --> 25:17.183
a lot.

25:17.216 --> 25:18.685
Gets kind of graphic.

25:18.718 --> 25:21.754
Ooh. Okay, I'm gonna need
to, uh, listen to those,

25:21.788 --> 25:23.022
and probably
take them...
Tony!

25:23.055 --> 25:24.090
What is wrong with you?

25:26.158 --> 25:27.594
KATE:
Um...

25:27.627 --> 25:29.962
burn him a copy, McGee.

25:29.996 --> 25:33.132
What I was going to say:

25:33.165 --> 25:34.967
if the petty officer

25:35.001 --> 25:37.036
was afraid to talk in public,

25:37.069 --> 25:38.337
she might be talking
in private.

25:38.370 --> 25:40.039
She may have opened up
to some

25:40.072 --> 25:41.941
of her friends inside the ward--
it's a good idea.

25:41.974 --> 25:43.976
TONY:
It's a well-known fact,
Mr. McGee,

25:44.010 --> 25:46.613
that women tell each other
everything.

25:46.646 --> 25:48.948
That would explain why none of
my friends will go out with you.

25:48.981 --> 25:50.349
I'm sorry, say something?

25:50.382 --> 25:52.151
Nothing.

25:53.219 --> 25:54.954
Agent DiNozzo?
Yeah.

25:54.987 --> 25:57.289
I was told to report
to you this morning.

25:57.323 --> 25:59.191
Not to me, Petty Officer--

25:59.225 --> 26:00.993
to him.

26:04.931 --> 26:06.999
( over speaker ):
Am I in trouble?

26:07.033 --> 26:09.035
GIBBS:
Depends.

26:09.068 --> 26:10.436
MORGAN:
On what, sir?

26:10.469 --> 26:14.073
GIBBS:
You told us you were at the
front desk your entire watch.

26:14.106 --> 26:16.876
Except for when
I was making rounds, sir.

26:16.909 --> 26:20.079
How long do the rounds take?

26:20.112 --> 26:22.214
A few minutes.

26:25.117 --> 26:26.853
A few minutes.

26:26.886 --> 26:28.855
Okay, got that.

26:28.888 --> 26:30.657
Did you see anyone
else come in or out

26:30.690 --> 26:32.124
of the exit of the
ward that night?

26:32.158 --> 26:33.693
No, sir.

26:33.726 --> 26:35.728
What about hearing
anything unusual?

26:35.762 --> 26:37.096
No, nothing.

26:37.129 --> 26:39.065
Until you showed up, sir.

26:41.033 --> 26:43.335
Yep.

26:43.369 --> 26:46.105
We got us a problem,
Petty Officer.

26:46.138 --> 26:47.239
Sir?

26:47.273 --> 26:50.643
Jessica Smith was murdered
last night.

26:50.677 --> 26:52.411
MORGAN:
Murdered?

26:52.444 --> 26:55.147
GIBBS:
And... according to you,

26:55.181 --> 26:57.817
you're the only
that could've done it.

26:57.850 --> 26:59.118
There's no way he did it.

26:59.151 --> 27:00.887
Look at his reaction.

27:00.920 --> 27:03.022
Maybe he's just
a good actor.

27:03.055 --> 27:04.290
Nobody's that good.

27:06.258 --> 27:07.994
I've been thinking, Kate.

27:08.027 --> 27:10.096
About the photo.

27:12.431 --> 27:14.000
I'm sorry.

27:14.033 --> 27:15.267
I mean, you know
I'd never...

27:15.301 --> 27:17.069
give it out, right?

27:18.270 --> 27:20.406
In fact,
I'm gonna delete it right now.

27:20.439 --> 27:21.808
Really?

27:21.841 --> 27:22.374
Mm-hmm.

27:23.309 --> 27:24.944
Thank you, Tony.

27:24.977 --> 27:27.013
That-that would be
a huge relief.

27:29.048 --> 27:29.982
What are you doing?

27:30.016 --> 27:32.018
Acting, Kate.

27:32.051 --> 27:33.786
It's not that hard.

27:33.820 --> 27:37.056
MORGAN:
Okay. I... I lied, sir.

27:37.089 --> 27:40.026
Yeah. Yeah, I kind of
figured that out

27:40.059 --> 27:41.794
for myself, Petty Officer.

27:41.828 --> 27:43.362
I screwed up, sir.

27:43.395 --> 27:45.264
I really screwed up.

27:45.297 --> 27:48.901
Kind of figured
that one out, too.

27:48.935 --> 27:52.238
I-I left my post
for about 40 minutes.

27:52.271 --> 27:55.107
I was...

27:55.141 --> 27:57.209
with someone.

27:57.243 --> 27:59.078
This person have a name?

27:59.111 --> 28:01.781
One of the...

28:01.814 --> 28:04.283
patients, sir.

28:04.316 --> 28:06.953
Catherine Reynolds.

28:06.986 --> 28:09.121
Doing what?

28:09.155 --> 28:13.760
W-We've been having sex
for three months now.

28:15.494 --> 28:18.130
Tony, I want you to talk
to Catherine Reynolds.

28:18.164 --> 28:20.032
See if she'll verify
Morgan's alibi.

28:20.066 --> 28:21.067
My pleasure.

28:21.100 --> 28:23.035
GIBBS:
Kate, you're with me.

28:23.069 --> 28:25.204
McGee.

28:27.506 --> 28:29.041
McGee!

28:29.075 --> 28:32.044
( woman's voice
over headphones )

28:33.112 --> 28:34.513
What the hell
are you doing?

28:34.546 --> 28:38.184
Well, I'm-I'm listening
to Petty Officer Smith's
group therapy sessions.

28:38.217 --> 28:41.220
There's two people that
she interacts with the most:
Catherine Reynolds,

28:41.253 --> 28:43.089
Lynn Simons--
they've got a
lot in common:

28:43.122 --> 28:44.490
knitting,
crossword puzzles,

28:44.523 --> 28:46.058
the TV show...
McGee!

28:46.092 --> 28:47.894
Well, I think
they may be friends.

28:47.927 --> 28:49.061
Why does this matter?

28:49.095 --> 28:50.162
Well, she may have
confided in them,

28:50.196 --> 28:52.765
told them something that
she didn't tell anybody else.

28:53.565 --> 28:55.301
That's good
thinking, McGee.

28:55.334 --> 28:56.903
I'm the one who came up...
Tony,

28:56.936 --> 28:59.505
go baby-sit our corpsman
in Interrogation.

28:59.538 --> 29:00.873
McGee, you interview

29:00.907 --> 29:01.974
Reynolds and Simons.

29:03.042 --> 29:05.244
Why didn't you tell
himhad that idea.

29:05.277 --> 29:09.816
Tony, a wise man once told me:
there's no "I" in "team."

29:12.384 --> 29:14.386
Where we going?

29:14.420 --> 29:16.522
Jessica Smith's house.

29:16.555 --> 29:18.090
I think
she was telling the truth

29:18.124 --> 29:20.192
about someone
being in her bedroom.

29:29.135 --> 29:31.037
( clattering )

29:34.140 --> 29:36.242
( gunshots )
Down!

29:38.377 --> 29:39.445
( panting )

29:39.478 --> 29:40.880
Are you okay?

29:40.913 --> 29:41.981
Yeah.

29:42.014 --> 29:44.150
Let's get this bastard.

29:57.864 --> 29:59.465
( car engine starting )

30:00.499 --> 30:02.168
( gunshot )

30:04.470 --> 30:06.839
( tires screeching )

30:08.574 --> 30:10.309
GIBBS:
Did you get a plate?

30:10.342 --> 30:12.344
No.

30:16.315 --> 30:18.584
Aw, damn it.

30:18.617 --> 30:21.153
What do you think
they were looking for?

30:22.188 --> 30:24.323
( sighing ):
Well...

30:47.313 --> 30:49.048
Found something.

30:49.081 --> 30:50.950
Not quite sure what.

30:50.983 --> 30:53.953
You have any idea?

30:57.223 --> 31:00.326
That's a radio receiver
and broadcast speaker.

31:00.359 --> 31:03.229
I guess Jessica Smith
was hearing voices.

31:03.262 --> 31:08.367
Yeah. And they weren't
in her head.

31:12.571 --> 31:15.141
ABBY:
So, the parts are off the shelf,
but the execution is

31:15.174 --> 31:16.909
very, very sophisticated.

31:16.943 --> 31:18.911
The receiver is
actually the guts

31:18.945 --> 31:20.479
from a disposable
cell phone.

31:20.512 --> 31:22.414
You dial the number,
and the device activates.

31:22.448 --> 31:23.549
Like a terrorist bomb.

31:23.582 --> 31:24.683
Well, yeah,
but in this case,

31:24.716 --> 31:26.618
instead of an explosion,
you get this.

31:26.652 --> 31:31.523
( echoing whispers ):
Jess... ica... Jessica...

31:31.557 --> 31:34.593
Over here... Over here...

31:34.626 --> 31:36.362
He's dead... your fiance...

31:36.395 --> 31:39.231
( turns off recording )
Whoa.

31:39.265 --> 31:41.200
It's like the soundtrack
to Friday the 13th.

31:42.234 --> 31:44.070
You know, the movie?

31:44.103 --> 31:45.671
There were, like,
11 of them.

31:45.704 --> 31:47.673
Oh, Gibbs,

31:47.706 --> 31:49.942
you really need to get out
of your basement more.

31:49.976 --> 31:51.210
What were they about?
Basically,

31:51.243 --> 31:53.479
there's this guy
that wears a hockey mask,

31:53.512 --> 31:55.214
and he kills teenagers
with a machete,

31:55.247 --> 31:57.016
usually right after
they had sex.

31:57.049 --> 31:58.650
Why?

31:58.684 --> 32:00.019
Well, he died
at summer camp,

32:00.052 --> 32:01.253
so his mother killed
everyone there.

32:01.287 --> 32:03.222
But he was actually alive
and he was living in the woods,

32:03.255 --> 32:05.124
but then he died
and he went to Hell,

32:05.157 --> 32:06.292
and then he was frozen,

32:06.325 --> 32:07.493
and then he went
to outer space...

32:07.526 --> 32:09.728
It's complicated.

32:09.761 --> 32:11.998
You don't know, do you?
Not a clue.

32:12.031 --> 32:14.166
I keep hoping they're
gonna explain it
in the next one.

32:14.200 --> 32:15.334
You call me
when you find

32:15.367 --> 32:16.402
something, Abby.

32:16.435 --> 32:17.669
( phone rings )

32:17.703 --> 32:18.971
Yeah. Gibbs.

32:19.005 --> 32:20.973
ABBY:
Found something.

32:24.310 --> 32:25.311
( clears throat )

32:27.146 --> 32:28.480
See this?

32:28.514 --> 32:30.482
Yes.
I cut myself today

32:30.516 --> 32:32.684
installing a graphics card
in my computer.

32:32.718 --> 32:34.753
Okay. Want me to kiss
it or something?

32:34.786 --> 32:36.388
That would be really nice,

32:36.422 --> 32:38.557
but it's not my point.

32:38.590 --> 32:41.593
Most of the metal inside
electronics is unfinished.

32:41.627 --> 32:43.762
I cut myself all the time
on burrs and rough edges.

32:43.795 --> 32:45.597
Yeah? Well, you ought
to try building a boat

32:45.631 --> 32:47.366
with hand tools
after a couple shots of Jack.

32:47.399 --> 32:49.701
Anyway, my point is,
I was snooping

32:49.735 --> 32:52.971
around the circuit board,
and I found...

32:53.772 --> 32:55.141
...this.

32:59.278 --> 33:00.746
It's blood, Gibbs.

33:00.779 --> 33:03.015
Whoever assembled this
cut themselves.

33:03.049 --> 33:04.483
We have their DNA.

33:05.417 --> 33:06.585
That's great work, Abby.

33:08.087 --> 33:10.122
Feel better?

33:10.156 --> 33:12.391
Much.

33:12.424 --> 33:14.226
WITTEN:
Is there some reason
why you people

33:14.260 --> 33:16.062
don't feel the need
to call ahead?

33:16.095 --> 33:19.431
Or is it that you
just enjoy arriving
unannounced like this?

33:19.465 --> 33:21.633
Depends on the
situation, Commander.

33:21.667 --> 33:23.335
Well, I have a war
to run here.

33:23.369 --> 33:26.638
I don't have time
for this, Agent McGee.

33:26.672 --> 33:29.041
I'm here to interview
several of your patients.

33:29.075 --> 33:30.542
Catherine Reynolds
and Petty Officer

33:30.576 --> 33:31.677
Lynn Simons.

33:31.710 --> 33:35.481
Simons was discharged
from the Navy three weeks ago.

33:35.514 --> 33:37.216
Catherine Reynolds
is in her room,

33:37.249 --> 33:39.085
and I do not want
her disturbed.

33:39.118 --> 33:40.219
You should've called.

33:40.252 --> 33:42.088
I could've saved you the trip.

33:42.121 --> 33:44.656
Commander...
it wasn't a request.

33:44.690 --> 33:46.125
Do you have

33:46.158 --> 33:47.693
any idea how upsetting

33:47.726 --> 33:49.628
your presence was
the other night?

33:49.661 --> 33:51.063
Some. Do you have any idea

33:51.097 --> 33:52.531
what's going on
inside your own ward?

33:52.564 --> 33:54.500
And what exactly is
that supposed to mean?

33:54.533 --> 33:56.202
Well, we can start
with Corpsman Morgan

33:56.235 --> 33:58.470
having sex with Ms. Reynolds
during the last three months.

33:58.504 --> 34:00.172
That's impossible--
I would've known...

34:00.206 --> 34:01.807
And we can end
with Jessica Smith's murder.

34:01.840 --> 34:04.643
It's your call, Commander.

34:05.711 --> 34:09.081
( knocking at door )

34:09.115 --> 34:09.848
Catherine,
it's Commander Witten.

34:09.881 --> 34:10.682
Are you decent?

34:10.716 --> 34:13.485
If I was, I wouldn't
be in here, Doc.

34:13.519 --> 34:14.520
Go away.

34:14.553 --> 34:15.554
You have a visitor.

34:17.123 --> 34:19.091
NCIS Special Agent
McGee.

34:20.592 --> 34:22.361
Bummer.
I thought it was the cute one.

34:22.394 --> 34:23.462
Uh, well, I just

34:23.495 --> 34:25.397
need to ask
a few questions,

34:25.431 --> 34:26.798
Ms. Reynolds.

34:26.832 --> 34:29.568
Okay, as long as I can
ask you some back.

34:29.601 --> 34:31.437
I'll just be
down the hall.

34:42.448 --> 34:44.116
Uh,

34:44.150 --> 34:47.653
this is about Corpsman
Timothy Morgan, ma'am.

34:47.686 --> 34:49.488
Um, claims
that he has

34:49.521 --> 34:52.724
been in a relationship
with you

34:52.758 --> 34:54.760
and that on the night
of Jessica Smith's death

34:54.793 --> 34:55.761
that he was...

34:55.794 --> 34:57.129
With me knocking boots.

34:57.163 --> 34:59.131
You take what
you can get

34:59.165 --> 35:01.133
around here, Agent McGee.

35:01.167 --> 35:02.801
My turn.

35:02.834 --> 35:05.271
Are you a virgin?

35:06.705 --> 35:07.706
No.

35:09.175 --> 35:10.642
Are you sure?

35:10.676 --> 35:13.179
Uh, the last time I checked.

35:13.212 --> 35:16.114
And that was two questions,
Ms. Reynolds.

35:17.649 --> 35:20.686
What time were you
with Morgan?

35:20.719 --> 35:24.290
I think it was between
7:00 and 8:30.

35:24.323 --> 35:27.926
And were you close
to Jessica Smith at all?

35:27.959 --> 35:31.597
I really liked her.

35:31.630 --> 35:33.699
She didn't belong here.

35:33.732 --> 35:36.235
Ever been in love?

35:36.268 --> 35:37.903
Love?

35:39.571 --> 35:42.808
Yeah. Sometimes I think
I might have been, yeah.

35:42.841 --> 35:45.477
Honesty.

35:45.511 --> 35:47.179
I like that.

35:47.213 --> 35:49.648
Very rare in a man.

35:49.681 --> 35:51.950
Did Jessica ever tell you
anything about her problems?

35:51.983 --> 35:53.952
Yes.

35:53.985 --> 35:55.321
So what did she say?

35:57.656 --> 35:59.925
She was having an affair
with a married man.

35:59.958 --> 36:01.293
Did she tell you his name?

36:01.327 --> 36:03.462
Nope.

36:05.297 --> 36:07.199
Okay.

36:07.233 --> 36:08.767
All right.
Well, thank you,
Mrs. Reynolds.

36:08.800 --> 36:09.801
You've been
very helpful...

36:09.835 --> 36:14.306
But she did tell Lynn Simons
who then told me.

36:18.844 --> 36:22.481
Boxers or tighty-whiteys?

36:22.514 --> 36:24.583
Depends. I guess both.

36:24.616 --> 36:27.219
What about right now?

36:27.253 --> 36:29.421
Boxers.

36:31.957 --> 36:33.992
He was her CO.

36:34.025 --> 36:36.395
Bastard never returned
any of her phone calls in here.

36:36.428 --> 36:40.732
So she asked Lynn
to deliver a message for her.

36:45.937 --> 36:49.608
McGEE:
Petty Officer Lynn Simons,
avionics and electronics tech.

36:49.641 --> 36:52.511
Received a medical discharge
three weeks ago.

36:52.544 --> 36:54.480
Jessica Smith asked her
to deliver a message

36:54.513 --> 36:55.414
to Captain Vetter.

36:55.447 --> 36:57.616
She loved him
and promised to
forgive him

36:57.649 --> 36:59.318
if he would
just contact her.

36:59.351 --> 37:00.319
Simons failed
to report

37:00.352 --> 37:02.254
to her therapy session
at the VA two weeks ago.

37:02.288 --> 37:04.323
No one's seen
her since, Gibbs.

37:04.356 --> 37:06.425
Find her. McGee,
get Captain Vetter in here.

37:06.458 --> 37:08.727
He refuses, put him in cuffs.

37:08.760 --> 37:10.362
You might want
to hear this, boss.

37:10.396 --> 37:12.264
Vetter and Commander Witten
both served

37:12.298 --> 37:13.399
on the USS Kennedy
in '99.

37:13.432 --> 37:15.033
It's a big ship, Tony.

37:15.066 --> 37:15.901
It could be a coincidence.

37:15.934 --> 37:18.404
Yeah, I don't believe in
coincidences.

37:18.437 --> 37:19.405
Hey, it's me.

37:19.438 --> 37:20.806
We need to talk.

37:25.577 --> 37:28.980
So what's the plan,
good cop/bad cop?

37:29.014 --> 37:31.650
More like
bad cop/scary cop, McGee.

37:31.683 --> 37:33.018
Which one's which?

37:33.051 --> 37:34.920
I think you'll have to ask
their ex-wives that one.

37:34.953 --> 37:36.388
VETTER:
I demand to know

37:36.422 --> 37:37.856
what the hell
is going on here!

37:37.889 --> 37:38.857
Not much.

37:38.890 --> 37:40.292
Just the end
of your life

37:40.326 --> 37:41.693
as you know it,
Captain.

37:41.727 --> 37:44.530
You see what I've had
to deal with, Agent Gibbs--

37:44.563 --> 37:45.931
threats, intimidation--

37:45.964 --> 37:47.299
I won't stand for it.

37:47.333 --> 37:48.367
You told me

37:48.400 --> 37:50.636
Petty Officer Smith
was like a daughter to you?

37:50.669 --> 37:52.971
What's that got to do
with this?

37:53.004 --> 37:56.342
Considering you're
sleeping with her,

37:56.375 --> 37:59.077
a lot.

37:59.110 --> 38:01.447
I want a lawyer.

38:01.480 --> 38:03.549
Yeah, you'll need one.

38:03.582 --> 38:05.016
She was murdered.

38:06.852 --> 38:08.387
We think it was you.

38:11.790 --> 38:13.925
Where were you
Wednesday night?

38:13.959 --> 38:16.428
At home with my wife.

38:16.462 --> 38:19.465
Well, we checked
with her, Vetter.

38:19.498 --> 38:20.732
She said you went out.

38:20.766 --> 38:22.334
Didn't come back
till around midnight.

38:22.368 --> 38:24.069
No, she's lying.

38:24.102 --> 38:25.036
Maybe.

38:25.070 --> 38:25.904
They do tend to get vindictive

38:25.937 --> 38:26.605
when they find out

38:26.638 --> 38:27.439
you've been cheating on them.

38:27.473 --> 38:29.441
VETTER:
You told her about Jessica?

38:29.475 --> 38:31.410
I did.

38:31.443 --> 38:32.243
GIBBS:
You might want to consult

38:32.277 --> 38:33.111
a divorce lawyer
while you're at it.

38:33.144 --> 38:35.814
I didn't kill Jessica.

38:35.847 --> 38:37.983
I loved her, for God's sake.

38:38.016 --> 38:39.851
He loved her, Gibbs.

38:39.885 --> 38:41.453
I guess that's it then.

38:41.487 --> 38:42.354
We got to let him go.

38:42.388 --> 38:45.924
Sure. After 80 or 90
years in Leavenworth.

38:45.957 --> 38:48.527
You have means,
you have motive

38:48.560 --> 38:50.596
and you have
no alibi, Vetter.

38:50.629 --> 38:52.398
She catch you
taking the kickbacks

38:52.431 --> 38:53.932
or was she just helping you?

38:59.405 --> 39:00.338
She caught me.

39:00.372 --> 39:03.141
The money was supposed
to have been for us,

39:03.174 --> 39:06.678
after the divorce.

39:06.712 --> 39:10.115
But I swear to you both,
I didn't, I couldn't kill her.

39:10.148 --> 39:13.385
You know what might help me
believe him, Gibbs?

39:13.419 --> 39:14.420
If he started
crying?

39:14.453 --> 39:15.521
Nah.

39:15.554 --> 39:17.789
If the good captain here
told us where the money is.

39:19.157 --> 39:20.659
Are you offering me a deal?

39:20.692 --> 39:22.694
Depends.

39:22.728 --> 39:25.130
Who else knew
the location of the money?

39:25.163 --> 39:27.566
Only me.

39:27.599 --> 39:29.601
Me and Jessica.

39:33.071 --> 39:35.106
TONY:
He's telling the truth, boss.

39:35.140 --> 39:37.075
He stashed the money
in a gym locker.

39:37.108 --> 39:40.446
Looks to be around $800,000
in a green duffel bag.

39:40.479 --> 39:43.449
Who do you think's
going to pick it up, Gibbs?

39:43.482 --> 39:44.650
Our killer.

39:48.487 --> 39:49.721
Boss, the GPS marker Tony put
with the money

39:49.755 --> 39:50.722
is showing movement.

39:50.756 --> 39:52.190
Bag's in play, DiNozzo.

39:52.223 --> 39:53.692
Have Kate tighten up
on the entrance.

39:53.725 --> 39:54.693
Roger that.

39:54.726 --> 39:55.894
Tight around
the entrance.

40:01.099 --> 40:01.900
TONY:
It's Petty Officer Simons,
boss.

40:01.933 --> 40:04.736
Well, yes, Tony,
we can all see that.

40:04.770 --> 40:06.505
Take her down?

40:06.538 --> 40:08.206
Negative.

40:08.239 --> 40:09.441
I want to see where
she takes it.

40:09.475 --> 40:10.509
Whoa.

40:10.542 --> 40:12.611
That's $800,000
in there, Jethro.

40:12.644 --> 40:14.179
Relax, Tobias.

40:14.212 --> 40:15.747
It's not yours.

40:22.721 --> 40:23.955
( computer trills )

40:26.992 --> 40:28.560
( phone ringing )

40:28.594 --> 40:29.628
Yeah. Gibbs.

40:29.661 --> 40:31.997
Hey, I ran the blood drop
from the circuit board

40:32.030 --> 40:33.599
through AFDIL
and I got a match.

40:33.632 --> 40:35.000
It's a Petty Officer...

40:35.033 --> 40:36.134
Lynn Simons.

40:36.167 --> 40:37.836
We got it, Abbs. Thanks.

40:39.505 --> 40:41.540
I really hate it
when he does that.

40:41.573 --> 40:42.974
( beeping )

40:43.008 --> 40:44.209
She's heading
for Bethesda.

40:57.689 --> 40:59.758
She's picking up
Commander Witten, boss.

41:05.564 --> 41:06.632
( car alarm chirps )

41:09.601 --> 41:10.802
Strike that.
He's going
to follow her.

41:15.140 --> 41:17.576
Or she's going to follow him.

41:17.609 --> 41:19.210
Guess again,

41:19.244 --> 41:20.646
Sex Machine.

41:22.313 --> 41:23.615
It's your girlfriend.

41:33.859 --> 41:35.293
Got the money, babe?

41:35.326 --> 41:36.261
Oh, yeah.

41:36.294 --> 41:37.495
Good.

41:39.965 --> 41:41.600
( both laugh )

41:46.938 --> 41:49.541
Get out.

41:49.575 --> 41:50.642
Wh-What are you doing?

41:50.676 --> 41:53.579
What I always do--

41:53.612 --> 41:54.245
survive.

41:54.279 --> 41:56.247
But if it wasn't
for me,

41:56.281 --> 41:57.916
you never would have gotten her
back in the hospital,

41:57.949 --> 41:59.618
never would have known
where she hid the money.

41:59.651 --> 42:00.819
True.

42:00.852 --> 42:01.987
Now get out, bitch.

42:02.020 --> 42:03.655
Drop the weapon!
( gasps )

42:03.689 --> 42:05.957
They followed you!

42:05.991 --> 42:06.892
Drop it!
( hammer clicking )

42:06.925 --> 42:09.828
It's not loaded! Please
don't shoot! Please!

42:09.861 --> 42:12.197
You stupid bitch!

42:12.230 --> 42:14.165
Aah! Aah!

42:14.199 --> 42:14.766
Don't touch me!

42:14.800 --> 42:16.301
You're not my type, lady.

42:16.334 --> 42:18.670
Hey, get your hands
on the wheel!

42:19.370 --> 42:23.174
Kate, cuff this wack job.

42:23.208 --> 42:25.711
( grunting )

42:28.814 --> 42:30.582
( groans )
( cuffs clicking shut )

42:35.687 --> 42:37.555
( computer chimes )

42:48.099 --> 42:49.300
( computer chimes )

42:54.405 --> 42:55.741
( chuckles )

42:56.775 --> 42:58.143
That's not me.

42:58.176 --> 42:59.911
Well, of course it's not you.

42:59.945 --> 43:01.913
Too bad nobody else
is going to know that.

43:01.947 --> 43:03.381
That's low, Kate.

43:03.414 --> 43:05.717
I learned from the best, Tony.

43:07.653 --> 43:09.120
We both delete
at the same time?

43:09.154 --> 43:10.989
On three.

43:11.022 --> 43:12.390
One...

43:12.423 --> 43:13.792
two...

43:13.825 --> 43:15.093
three.

43:15.126 --> 43:16.628
( keyboards click )

43:18.930 --> 43:20.331
( computer chimes )

43:26.705 --> 43:27.405
See you tomorrow, boss.

43:27.438 --> 43:28.774
Have a good one, Gibbs.
