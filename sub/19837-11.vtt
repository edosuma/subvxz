00:20.140 --> 00:23.250
<b>The word "unknown" holds magic.</b>

00:23.250 --> 00:27.080
<b>And some incredible people are 
drawn to that magic.</b>

00:27.790 --> 00:29.590
<b>They are known...</b>

00:33.160 --> 00:35.010
<b>...as Hunters!</b>

01:55.600 --> 01:57.330
<b>Then, I'll let go of him.</b>

01:59.220 --> 02:00.560
<b>Whoa! Wait!</b>

02:00.560 --> 02:02.560
<b>I'm awake! I'm awake...</b>

02:02.560 --> 02:04.180
<b>Don't let me go!</b>

02:10.450 --> 02:14.570
<b>However, you're down to twenty hours.</b>

02:15.390 --> 02:20.070

<b>It's your turn!</b>

02:49.250 --> 02:51.600
<b>What will they bet on next?</b>

02:52.690 --> 02:56.600
<b>Well, are you going to tell me 
what the next bet will be?</b>

02:56.600 --> 02:59.700
<b>Or have you lost your nerve because 
I've figured out your scheme?</b>

03:03.080 --> 03:04.070
<b>Very well.</b>

03:10.160 --> 03:12.710
<b>She's really cute...</b>

03:15.710 --> 03:18.830
<b>That old guy's probably 
dancing on the inside.</b>

03:18.830 --> 03:20.970
<b>I have a bad feeling about this.</b>

03:20.970 --> 03:25.600
<b>Then let's bet on whether 
I'm a man or a woman.</b>

03:25.600 --> 03:27.060
<b>Huh?</b>

03:27.060 --> 03:28.310
<b>What's wrong?</b>

03:28.310 --> 03:30.150
<b>Is there a problem?</b>

03:30.150 --> 03:31.560
<b>N-No.</b>

03:32.520 --> 03:35.060
<b><i>She's obviously a woman...</i></b>

03:35.400 --> 03:37.480
<b><i>Or could she be a tranny?</i></b>

03:38.570 --> 03:41.350
<b><i>No, she's gotta be a woman.</i></b>

03:43.670 --> 03:45.230
<b>That's fine,</b>

03:45.230 --> 03:49.330
<b>but how will you prove if I'm wrong?</b>

03:49.330 --> 03:51.250
<b>Oh, right...</b>

03:51.250 --> 03:55.140
<b>I'll let you examine every part of my body.</b>

03:55.140 --> 03:57.210
<b>Until you're fully satisfied.</b>

03:57.210 --> 03:59.610
<b>Seriously?</b>

03:59.610 --> 04:01.800
<b>Her body?</b>

04:05.300 --> 04:08.440
<b>Leorio will bet she's a man.</b>

04:08.440 --> 04:09.460
<b>Uh-huh.</b>

04:09.460 --> 04:11.310
<b>Huh? Why?</b>

04:11.310 --> 04:13.120
<b>Okay, I've decided.</b>

04:13.770 --> 04:16.310
<b>I bet ten hours that you're a man!</b>

04:18.720 --> 04:19.750
<b>I knew it.</b>

04:19.750 --> 04:21.730
<b>Dirty old man...</b>

04:21.730 --> 04:23.820
<b>Huh? But how did you know?</b>

04:24.400 --> 04:27.950
<b><i>This way, even if I'm wrong, 
and it turns out she's female,</i></b>

04:27.950 --> 04:30.200
<b><i>I'll still get to examine her body!</i></b>

04:30.650 --> 04:34.580
<b><i>It's a win-win situation.</i></b>

04:34.580 --> 04:37.110
<b><i>Actually, please be wrong...</i></b>

04:37.110 --> 04:38.230
<b>There you have it.</b>

04:38.230 --> 04:39.710
<b>I get it now.</b>

04:42.050 --> 04:43.970
<b>Okay! Reveal the answer!</b>

04:47.340 --> 04:50.220
<b>Too bad... I'm a woman.</b>

04:50.220 --> 04:53.230
<b>R-Really?</b>

04:53.830 --> 04:56.730
<b>Would you like to check?</b>

04:56.730 --> 05:00.590
<b>B-B-But of course!</b>

05:12.670 --> 05:14.250
<b><i>A mistake I do not regret.</i></b>

05:16.050 --> 05:18.620
<b>Just watching hurts...</b>

05:18.620 --> 05:20.250
<b>He's gonna lose.</b>

05:20.250 --> 05:21.340
<b>Huh?</b>

05:21.340 --> 05:25.010
<b>The opponent has seen through 
Leorio's strategy.</b>

05:25.010 --> 05:27.350
<b>He's been betting conservatively,</b>

05:27.350 --> 05:30.010
<b>to minimize damage from either outcome.</b>

05:30.570 --> 05:37.020
<b>A gambler who focuses on avoiding 
a loss won't ever win.</b>

05:37.940 --> 05:42.520
<b>I guess Leorio just doesn't 
have what it takes.</b>

05:44.350 --> 05:45.900
<b><i>As expected.</i></b>

05:45.900 --> 05:49.780
<b><i>His approach to gambling 
doesn't frighten me at all.</i></b>

05:49.780 --> 05:53.910
<b><i>He'll never beat me that way.</i></b>

05:56.400 --> 05:59.520
<b>Now it's your turn to think of a gamble.</b>

05:59.520 --> 06:01.100
<b>What do you want to bet on?</b>

06:03.660 --> 06:05.750
<b><i>This is no time to celebrate.</i></b>

06:06.640 --> 06:09.430
<b><i>I only have ten hours left...</i></b>

06:10.180 --> 06:12.670
<b>Leorio has no more room for error.</b>

06:12.670 --> 06:16.380
<b>If he loses the next wager, 
the overall score will be 2-2.</b>

06:16.380 --> 06:21.940
<b>And we will have fifty fewer hours 
to escape this tower.</b>

06:23.090 --> 06:24.690
<b>Leorio...</b>

06:24.690 --> 06:27.280
<b>I can't lose the next bet,</b>

06:27.280 --> 06:31.060
<b>but I can't think of anything 
that'd be a surefire win...</b>

06:31.550 --> 06:33.030
<b>Oh, that's it!</b>

06:33.030 --> 06:36.280
<b>We can bet on whether I'm 
a man or a woman.</b>

06:36.280 --> 06:39.460
<b>No, that wouldn't work...</b>

06:39.460 --> 06:41.570
<b>Hey, old man...</b>

06:41.570 --> 06:44.390
<b>You're thinking aloud.</b>

06:44.390 --> 06:45.590
<b>I know.</b>

06:45.590 --> 06:46.950
<b>Leorio!</b>

06:46.950 --> 06:48.110
<b>Huh?</b>

06:48.110 --> 06:51.490
<b>How about whether or not 
you're still in your teens?</b>

06:51.490 --> 06:53.020
<b>Come on, Gon!</b>

06:53.020 --> 06:55.560
<b>I don't look that old...</b>

06:55.560 --> 06:57.690
<b>I'm clearly a teenager!</b>

06:58.350 --> 07:00.230
<b>T-Teenager?</b>

07:02.060 --> 07:04.610
<b>But he looks like an old man.</b>

07:04.610 --> 07:07.610
<b>Right! In that case, we'll use 
rock-paper-scissors!</b>

07:08.010 --> 07:10.610
<b>A bet on who'll win a game 
of rock-paper-scissors!</b>

07:12.220 --> 07:13.620
<b>Sure.</b>

07:13.620 --> 07:15.430
<b>Rock-paper-scissors?</b>

07:15.430 --> 07:17.950
<b>Why did he have to pick 
such a difficult wager?</b>

07:17.950 --> 07:18.760
<b>Huh?</b>

07:18.760 --> 07:21.120
<b>Rock-paper-scissors is hard?</b>

07:22.520 --> 07:26.130
<b><i>I happen to be quite confident in 
my rock-paper-scissors skill.</i></b>

07:26.690 --> 07:32.510
<b><i>Just recently, I won a gourmet vacation 
in a tournament in the shopping district.</i></b>

07:32.510 --> 07:34.280
<b>Let's see, then.</b>

07:34.280 --> 07:38.270
<b>I'll put eighty hours on my victory.</b>

07:38.780 --> 07:41.140
<b>E-Eighty hours?</b>

07:41.140 --> 07:43.310
<b>Is something wrong?</b>

07:43.310 --> 07:45.400
<b>I'm free to bet as much as I want.</b>

07:45.400 --> 07:49.400
<b>W-Well, that's true.</b>

07:49.400 --> 07:54.400
<b>And if you lose, I can still only 
take ten from you.</b>

07:54.400 --> 07:55.410
<b>Don't worry.</b>

07:56.440 --> 07:58.750
<b><i>She doesn't need to bet eighty.</i></b>

07:58.750 --> 08:00.410
<b><i>Ten would suffice.</i></b>

08:00.970 --> 08:02.620
<b><i>What if she loses?</i></b>

08:02.620 --> 08:05.390
<b><i>Or is she that confident?</i></b>

08:07.130 --> 08:10.210
<b><i>As anticipated, he's starting to stress.</i></b>

08:10.930 --> 08:13.930
<b><i>He's so easy to read.</i></b>

08:14.380 --> 08:17.510
<b>While rock-paper-scissors has simple rules,</b>

08:17.510 --> 08:19.930
<b>the game itself is quite complex.</b>

08:20.910 --> 08:23.840
<b>If you consider the game 
from a probability standpoint,</b>

08:23.840 --> 08:27.110
<b>there's only a one-third chance of losing.</b>

08:28.560 --> 08:32.980
<b>However, if your opponent can predict 
your reasoning and control your reactions,</b>

08:32.980 --> 08:35.450
<b>defeat becomes much more likely.</b>

08:35.450 --> 08:38.400
<b>In other words, simple-minded Leorio</b>

08:38.400 --> 08:41.060
<b>will be at a disadvantage.</b>

08:41.060 --> 08:42.710
<b>I see.</b>

08:42.710 --> 08:44.520
<b>All right! I've made my decision.</b>

08:49.710 --> 08:51.360
<b>What?</b>

08:51.360 --> 08:54.160
<b>It's obvious what you'll use.</b>

08:55.210 --> 08:57.970
<b>I can read minds.</b>

08:58.380 --> 08:59.740
<b>Liar!</b>

08:59.740 --> 09:03.240
<b>Your bluffing won't scare me!</b>

09:03.240 --> 09:04.980
<b>You'll believe me soon enough.</b>

09:09.440 --> 09:12.990
<b><i>As planned, he's losing his 
cool over a blatant lie.</i></b>

09:12.990 --> 09:16.000
<b><i>She can read minds?</i></b>

09:16.000 --> 09:18.310
<b><i>She's lying. She must be lying...</i></b>

09:19.360 --> 09:21.990
<b><i>But what if she's telling the truth?</i></b>

09:21.990 --> 09:24.030
<b>Leorio will use rock.</b>

09:24.030 --> 09:24.620
<b>Huh?</b>

09:24.620 --> 09:25.620
<b>Let's do this!</b>

09:26.670 --> 09:27.790
<b>Rock...</b>

09:27.790 --> 09:28.790
<b>Paper...</b>

09:28.790 --> 09:29.590
<b>Scissors!</b>

09:33.380 --> 09:34.820
<b>You were right.</b>

09:34.820 --> 09:36.360
<b>Good guess.</b>

09:36.360 --> 09:39.290
<b>Nervous people unconsciously avoid</b>

09:39.290 --> 09:41.390
<b>any action that involves opening up.</b>

09:41.390 --> 09:45.390
<b>In other words, by making 
Leorio uncomfortable, she ensures</b>

09:45.390 --> 09:47.830
<b>that he's less likely to use paper.</b>

09:47.830 --> 09:50.690
<b>So if she sticks with rock,</b>

09:50.690 --> 09:52.900
<b>she's guaranteed a win or draw.</b>

09:53.530 --> 09:57.620
<b>As I was explaining, rock-paper-scissors 
is actually a mind game.</b>

09:57.620 --> 09:59.410
<b>Now I see.</b>

10:00.890 --> 10:02.380
<b>Hold on.</b>

10:02.380 --> 10:05.760
<b>Since we both used rock, wasn't that a draw?</b>

10:05.760 --> 10:07.230
<b>What of it?</b>

10:07.230 --> 10:08.420
<b>A-ha!</b>

10:08.420 --> 10:11.860
<b>So you were lying about being 
able to read my mind!</b>

10:11.860 --> 10:14.550
<b>If you really could, you'd have won.</b>

10:14.550 --> 10:15.510
<b>Right?</b>

10:18.240 --> 10:19.450
<b>What's so funny?</b>

10:19.450 --> 10:22.180
<b>I deliberately gave you that tie.</b>

10:22.180 --> 10:23.530
<b>Quit lying!</b>

10:23.530 --> 10:25.290
<b>Did you forget?</b>

10:25.290 --> 10:28.420
<b>We're trying to stall you here.</b>

10:30.170 --> 10:34.900
<b>If I chose to, I could force an 
indefinite series of draws...</b>

10:36.400 --> 10:40.660
<b>But that wouldn't be any fun.</b>

10:41.390 --> 10:43.660
<b>So I'll end this with the next turn.</b>

10:44.210 --> 10:47.010
<b>Well? What will you use next?</b>

10:47.010 --> 10:48.100
<b>Think hard.</b>

10:48.100 --> 10:49.030
<b>Come on.</b>

10:51.420 --> 10:52.670
<b>Damn!</b>

10:53.300 --> 10:54.500
<b><i>That's it.</i></b>

10:54.500 --> 10:57.670
<b><i>Worry. Fret.</i></b>

10:58.500 --> 11:01.000
<b>Worrying. Fretting.</b>

11:02.160 --> 11:06.040
<b>When someone loses confidence, 
they crave reassurance.</b>

11:06.040 --> 11:09.050
<b>That makes him more likely to 
either use the same hand,</b>

11:09.050 --> 11:10.890
<b>or, in an effort to regain his confidence,</b>

11:10.890 --> 11:13.520
<b>to use a stronger one than 
in the previous round.</b>

11:13.990 --> 11:15.440
<b>Meaning</b>

11:15.440 --> 11:20.200
<b>that she wants Leorio to choose 
either rock or paper.</b>

11:20.200 --> 11:21.550
<b>Yes.</b>

11:21.550 --> 11:24.680
<b>If she uses paper, she's certain not to lose.</b>

11:24.680 --> 11:27.950
<b>Then Leorio just needs to stay a step ahead!</b>

11:28.470 --> 11:32.460
<b>Well, if he could calm down, 
that might work.</b>

11:32.460 --> 11:34.110
<b>Leorio!</b>

11:34.460 --> 11:35.460
<b>What is it?</b>

11:35.460 --> 11:39.470
<b>Hey, you'll win if you go with scissors next!</b>

11:39.470 --> 11:40.880
<b>What? Scissors?</b>

11:42.640 --> 11:44.470
<b>Go ahead and try.</b>

11:45.840 --> 11:49.350
<b><i>Then she'll just use rock.</i></b>

11:49.350 --> 11:53.480
<b><i>No, she'll go a step further 
and choose paper.</i></b>

11:53.940 --> 11:57.180
<b><i>Wait, then she'll take another 
step and use scissors...</i></b>

11:57.180 --> 11:59.990
<b><i>No, no, then she'll take 
another step and use rock...</i></b>

12:01.490 --> 12:02.990
<b>Man, I have no idea what to think!</b>

12:02.990 --> 12:04.240
<b>Here we go!</b>

12:05.120 --> 12:06.240
<b>Here...</b>

12:06.240 --> 12:06.990
<b>comes the...</b>

12:06.990 --> 12:08.240
<b>draw!</b>

12:16.390 --> 12:17.960
<b>I win!</b>

12:23.010 --> 12:25.850
<b>Rock-paper-scissors really is complicated.</b>

12:25.850 --> 12:27.760
<b>Now the score is 2-2.</b>

12:28.290 --> 12:34.140
<b>Worse yet, we have to give up 
the fifty hours he lost.</b>

12:37.520 --> 12:40.570
<b>Sorry. I was pretty confident in my 
rock-paper-scissors ability.</b>

12:42.180 --> 12:43.510
<b>Pretty pathetic showing, then.</b>

12:43.510 --> 12:44.550
<b>What was that?!</b>

12:46.290 --> 12:49.030
<b>Well, I can't argue with you on this one.</b>

12:54.880 --> 12:59.800
<b>Say, how much time do 
they have left now?</b>

13:01.350 --> 13:03.980
<b>Fifty-nine hours, forty-five minutes.</b>

13:03.980 --> 13:04.800
<b>Which means</b>

13:05.450 --> 13:10.810
<b>they actually have fewer 
than ten hours left.</b>

13:11.450 --> 13:14.060
<b>It doesn't matter how much time they have.</b>

13:15.560 --> 13:20.800
<b>Because my opponent will die.</b>

13:31.100 --> 13:41.170
<b>Hunter Vocabulary</b>

13:37.000 --> 13:41.170
<b>Rock-Paper-Scissors</b>

13:42.590 --> 13:44.780
<b>It's finally time for the last round.</b>

13:44.780 --> 13:46.400
<b>Guess I'm off.</b>

13:46.920 --> 13:48.520
<b>What? Killua?</b>

13:48.520 --> 13:49.930
<b>What's that supposed to mean?</b>

13:50.480 --> 13:54.850
<b>Damn it! I really needed 
to win my round...</b>

13:55.230 --> 13:57.760
<b>Gon... This guy is totally pissing me off!</b>

13:57.760 --> 13:58.810
<b>Now, now.</b>

13:59.410 --> 14:03.560
<b>Don't give up before we even know 
what the contest is.</b>

14:03.560 --> 14:07.310
<b>Well, if it's something like 
mental math, I'm surrendering.</b>

14:07.310 --> 14:08.440
<b>That's right!</b>

14:08.440 --> 14:11.330
<b>Depending on the opponent, 
we still have a chance!</b>

14:12.760 --> 14:14.830
<b>That little kid is their last member.</b>

14:15.290 --> 14:17.750
<b>Never thought I'd see him 
fall prey to that monster.</b>

14:17.750 --> 14:20.330
<b>Poor thing. He's still so young.</b>

14:21.040 --> 14:24.500
<b>I didn't want to use him.</b>

14:25.380 --> 14:28.390
<b>However, the Hunter Exam has no mercy.</b>

14:28.390 --> 14:32.380
<b>If he dies here, that's fate.</b>

14:33.350 --> 14:34.860
<b>I'm removing his handcuffs.</b>

14:51.930 --> 14:54.040
<b>You guys are getting too scared...</b>

14:54.040 --> 14:55.120
<b>Idiot, stop!</b>

14:55.740 --> 14:58.260
<b>Is he really that terrifying?</b>

14:58.260 --> 15:00.370
<b>Isn't it all just ancient history?</b>

15:32.970 --> 15:33.760
<b>That guy...</b>

15:33.760 --> 15:35.010
<b>You know him?</b>

15:35.990 --> 15:37.850
<b>We should take the loss.</b>

15:37.850 --> 15:38.840
<b>Killua!</b>

15:38.840 --> 15:40.240
<b>Don't fight him.</b>

15:40.240 --> 15:41.290
<b>Why not?</b>

15:42.820 --> 15:44.540
<b>Johness the Dissector.</b>

15:44.060 --> 15:47.780
<b>Johness 
968-year sentence, mass murder</b>

15:45.180 --> 15:48.270
<b>The worst mass murderer in Zaban's history.</b>

15:50.040 --> 15:52.380
<b>He chose his victims randomly.</b>

15:53.140 --> 15:54.760
<b>It was a famous case...</b>

15:54.760 --> 16:00.310
<b>146 people, young and old, men and women,
 met with brutal deaths by his hand.</b>

16:00.980 --> 16:03.500
<b>The victims had one thing in common.</b>

16:04.200 --> 16:08.820
<b>He murdered all of them 
with his bare hands.</b>

16:09.430 --> 16:12.820
<b>He was known for his iron grip,</b>

16:13.580 --> 16:14.790
<b>the power in his fingers.</b>

16:16.270 --> 16:19.660
<b>It's been so long since 
I touched human flesh.</b>

16:21.460 --> 16:24.400
<b>You don't have to face that psychotic killer...</b>

16:24.400 --> 16:26.760
<b>There's always next year.</b>

16:29.340 --> 16:30.890
<b>Hey, Killua...</b>

16:32.410 --> 16:33.530
<b>Killua!</b>

16:35.500 --> 16:38.870
<b>Damn it, was he even listening to me?!</b>

16:38.870 --> 16:40.500
<b>We should let him go.</b>

16:40.500 --> 16:43.250
<b>He could have a plan.</b>

16:53.970 --> 16:55.760
<b>How are we settling this contest?</b>

16:55.760 --> 16:57.080
<b>Contest?</b>

16:57.080 --> 16:58.990
<b>I believe you're confused.</b>

16:59.750 --> 17:03.830
<b>This will be a one-sided massacre.</b>

17:03.830 --> 17:07.500
<b>I have no interest in the exam 
or any offer of amnesty.</b>

17:07.500 --> 17:10.950
<b>I just want to hear you scream.</b>

17:10.950 --> 17:13.120
<b>Really? Okay.</b>

17:13.120 --> 17:15.010
<b>Then the loser is the one who dies.</b>

17:17.010 --> 17:19.860
<b>Yeah, that's right.</b>

17:21.840 --> 17:27.550
<b>I'll tear your body apart.</b>

17:45.320 --> 17:47.640
<b>Wh-What?</b>

17:47.640 --> 17:49.920
<b>I'm so cold.</b>

17:57.380 --> 17:58.760
<b>That's...</b>

18:00.760 --> 18:01.990
<b>mine.</b>

18:05.760 --> 18:07.990
<b>G-Give it back.</b>

18:32.660 --> 18:35.460
<b>Okay. That's three wins, two losses.</b>

18:35.460 --> 18:36.740
<b>We pass, right?</b>

18:36.740 --> 18:39.680
<b>Yeah, you win.</b>

18:39.680 --> 18:43.060
<b>By the way, you must be 
itching for some action,</b>

18:43.580 --> 18:45.270
<b>since you didn't get to do anything.</b>

18:46.550 --> 18:48.810
<b>Want to play with me?</b>

18:50.840 --> 18:52.310
<b>I'll abstain.</b>

18:52.850 --> 18:54.070
<b>Oh, okay.</b>

18:57.120 --> 19:00.410
<b>Who is he?</b>

19:00.410 --> 19:02.410
<b>That's right. You guys don't know.</b>

19:02.410 --> 19:03.830
<b>Huh? Don't know what?</b>

19:03.830 --> 19:07.830
<b>Killua comes from an elite family of assassins.</b>

19:07.830 --> 19:11.330
<b>Eh? A-An elite family of assassins?</b>

19:11.330 --> 19:12.280
<b>I'm back.</b>

19:13.760 --> 19:14.550
<b>What?</b>

19:14.550 --> 19:16.580
<b>Uh... Well,</b>

19:17.040 --> 19:19.030
<b>good work!</b>

19:29.090 --> 19:30.850
<b>Across the bridge,</b>

19:30.850 --> 19:32.940
<b>you'll find a small room.</b>

19:32.940 --> 19:38.110
<b>You must spend the fifty hours 
you gambled away there.</b>

19:38.110 --> 19:39.750
<b>Well, let's go.</b>

19:39.750 --> 19:40.500
<b>Yeah!</b>

19:40.500 --> 19:41.770
<b>R-Right...</b>

20:01.520 --> 20:05.030
<b>Gittarackur, applicant #301, 
is the second to pass.</b>

20:05.030 --> 20:06.950
<b>Total time, twelve hours 
and two minutes.</b>

20:09.270 --> 20:12.320
<b>I figured you'd already 
crossed the finish line.</b>

20:14.550 --> 20:17.010
<b>All right!</b>

20:16.400 --> 20:20.400
<b>Hanzo, applicant #294, is the third to pass.</b>

20:17.480 --> 20:19.170
<b>I'm the first to finish!</b>

20:19.770 --> 20:20.750
<b>Huh?</b>

20:20.400 --> 20:22.170
<b>Total time, twelve hours 
and three minutes.</b>

20:20.750 --> 20:22.170
<b>No!</b>

20:22.170 --> 20:23.780
<b>I don't believe this...</b>

20:24.330 --> 20:26.410
<b>I came in third.</b>

20:30.660 --> 20:32.100
<b>Good grief.</b>

20:32.100 --> 20:36.370
<b>We have to spend fifty hours 
in this room?</b>

20:37.800 --> 20:38.670
<b>Killua.</b>

20:38.670 --> 20:39.520
<b>Huh?</b>

20:39.520 --> 20:41.510
<b>Can you tell me how that 
technique works?</b>

20:41.510 --> 20:42.930
<b>Technique?</b>

20:42.930 --> 20:46.050
<b>The one you used to instantly 
remove his heart.</b>

20:46.050 --> 20:49.760
<b>Oh, that wasn't even a technique.</b>

20:49.760 --> 20:51.240
<b>I just ripped it out.</b>

20:51.240 --> 20:52.140
<b>Ripped it out?</b>

20:53.070 --> 20:54.810
<b>But to make it easier,</b>

20:54.810 --> 20:58.820
<b>I manipulated my body a bit.</b>

20:59.220 --> 21:00.790
<b>Y-Your nails...</b>

21:00.790 --> 21:02.240
<b>Wow!</b>

21:02.820 --> 21:06.490
<b>Mass murderers are still only amateurs.</b>

21:07.170 --> 21:09.180
<b>I used to be a professional.</b>

21:09.180 --> 21:12.540
<b>But my old man would've done better.</b>

21:12.540 --> 21:16.040
<b>When he removes a heart, you won't 
see even a drop of blood.</b>

21:17.120 --> 21:19.000
<b>How reassuring.</b>

21:20.780 --> 21:22.750
<b><i>As long as he's on our side...</i></b>

21:24.180 --> 21:25.010
<b>Well, then.</b>

21:25.010 --> 21:27.290
<b>We have more than two whole days.</b>

21:27.800 --> 21:29.470
<b>What should we do, Killua?</b>

21:29.470 --> 21:31.900
<b>First, we should search the room</b>

21:31.900 --> 21:33.670
<b>for any kind of entertainment.</b>

21:33.670 --> 21:34.520
<b>Yeah!</b>

21:36.420 --> 21:39.020
<b>Man, you kids don't have 
a care in the world.</b>

21:45.780 --> 21:50.250
<b>Gon's team of five has passed the trial, 
with three wins and two losses.</b>

21:50.250 --> 21:53.290
<b>However, they must spend the fifty-hour 
penalty in this small room.</b>

21:54.200 --> 21:57.760
<b>They're running out of time.</b>

23:28.090 --> 23:30.380
<b>Next time: Last x Test Of x Resolve!</b>

23:30.380 --> 23:32.440
<b>Think like a fish!</b>

23:32.440 --> 23:33.500
<b>You can do that?</b>

23:33.500 --> 23:34.560
<b>Yep!</b>
