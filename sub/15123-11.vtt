WEBVTT

00:03.804 --> 00:05.339
Hey.

00:05.373 --> 00:06.274
All right.

00:06.307 --> 00:08.409
Who put the shapes
in the sorter for Hope?

00:08.442 --> 00:11.079
She's never going to learn
if we keep doing it for her.

00:11.112 --> 00:12.780
I didn't do it.
I've just been playing with

00:12.813 --> 00:14.182
this slinky for
the past two hours.

00:16.117 --> 00:17.751
Oh, my God, she's
doing it on her own.

00:17.785 --> 00:20.221
She can do the shape-sorter.
Good job, sweetie.

00:20.254 --> 00:23.124
That's better than good.
That is amazing.

00:23.157 --> 00:24.725
I mean, you were still
struggling with that toy

00:24.758 --> 00:25.759
when you were four.

00:28.529 --> 00:30.231
Virginia!

00:30.264 --> 00:31.399
He's getting frustrated again.

00:31.432 --> 00:32.566
Bring the sugar!

00:32.600 --> 00:34.368
Stupid star!

00:41.642 --> 00:44.678
You never really did have a
knack for the shape-sorter.

00:44.712 --> 00:45.779
We finally just
took that toy away

00:45.813 --> 00:46.947
and gave you
a bucket of checkers.

00:46.980 --> 00:50.284
We said if you could just pick
out one at a time, you win!

00:50.318 --> 00:51.819
Oh, yeah.
I remember that.

00:51.852 --> 00:54.422
Ooh, I was awesome
at Checker-Bucket.

00:54.455 --> 00:56.790
How the hell do you
open this thing?

01:02.730 --> 01:04.598
Ah, you're such a good mom.

01:05.766 --> 01:07.868
* Whoo!

01:07.901 --> 01:11.805
* Here we go, oh, oh, oh,
oh, oh, oh! *

01:13.474 --> 01:15.709
Ohh... Cute.

01:15.743 --> 01:17.478
What is she,
about two?

01:17.511 --> 01:18.779
Just about.

01:18.812 --> 01:20.248
She play with
the shape-sorter yet?

01:20.281 --> 01:21.815
Not yet.
She gets frustrated.

01:21.849 --> 01:24.152
My daughter's a whiz at it.

01:24.185 --> 01:24.952
Have you tried making
a checker-bucket?

01:24.985 --> 01:26.420
It's where you put
the checkers in,

01:26.454 --> 01:28.522
and let them take it
out one at at a time.

01:28.556 --> 01:29.757
It's good for the slower kids.

01:29.790 --> 01:31.259
That's what my
parents did for me.

01:31.292 --> 01:33.527
Oh, they must be very proud.

01:33.561 --> 01:36.197
Are you able to live
on your own, sweetheart?

01:36.230 --> 01:37.298
Not yet.

01:37.331 --> 01:38.532
Well, someday.

01:42.370 --> 01:45.539
Still annoying customers by
bragging about your genius baby?

01:45.573 --> 01:46.607
I was gonna go with
"highly gifted,"

01:46.640 --> 01:47.841
but if you want to throw
the word "genius" around,

01:47.875 --> 01:50.644
I'm not gonna argue with you.
It's good you're proud of her,

01:50.678 --> 01:51.845
and not threatened
by her like my dad was.

01:51.879 --> 01:54.382
Every time I'd answer more
Jeopardy questions than him,

01:54.415 --> 01:56.350
he'd accuse me of
sleeping with Alex Trebek.

01:56.384 --> 01:58.319
It's a tough thing
for a 12-year-old.

01:58.352 --> 01:59.753
Well, I'm not threatened.

01:59.787 --> 02:01.622
Besides, it's not like
she's smarter than me.

02:01.655 --> 02:03.857
She's a baby.
Well, not yet.

02:03.891 --> 02:06.360
But if she's not even two and
she's smarter than you were

02:06.394 --> 02:08.329
at four, then it's
only a matter of time

02:08.362 --> 02:10.631
before she's smarter than you.
Do the math.

02:16.870 --> 02:18.906
I can't do the math.

02:19.707 --> 02:20.774
I can't do the math!

02:20.808 --> 02:24.245
Okay. I was four and she's two.

02:24.278 --> 02:27.815
So, when she's four,
I'll be eight.

02:27.848 --> 02:30.518
No, wait a second.
That's not right.

02:30.551 --> 02:32.753
Sucks, man. I'm glad we
never had to worry about

02:32.786 --> 02:34.455
a kid being smarter than us.

02:34.488 --> 02:35.889
Hey!
No offense.

02:35.923 --> 02:37.425
But we always knew
you'd be dumb.

02:37.458 --> 02:38.726
'Cause we're both dumb.

02:38.759 --> 02:40.728
And that's how it works.
Your problem is,

02:40.761 --> 02:43.364
you made a baby with someone
much smarter than you.

02:43.397 --> 02:45.699
You really think Lucy was
that much smarter than me?

02:45.733 --> 02:49.737
She was a college graduate who
avoided the police for years

02:49.770 --> 02:51.639
while she went on a murder
spree. You're a high school

02:51.672 --> 02:54.642
dropout who's been arrested
five times for peeing in public.

02:54.675 --> 02:57.511
So, yeah, I'd say she's
much smarter than you.

03:00.848 --> 03:03.251
Look, Jimmy, it's like
the birds and the bees.

03:03.284 --> 03:04.918
Two birds have a baby,
they have a bird.

03:04.952 --> 03:06.854
Two bees have a baby,
they have a bee.

03:06.887 --> 03:09.390
You're like a bee that
had a baby with a bird.

03:09.423 --> 03:10.858
(laughs)
Now the bird's gone.

03:10.891 --> 03:12.926
And now you're a bee
trying to raise a bird-bee.

03:12.960 --> 03:14.595
Makes sense.

03:14.628 --> 03:16.797
So how's a bee supposed to
be able to raise a bird-bee?

03:16.830 --> 03:18.031
I'm not smart
enough for that.

03:18.065 --> 03:19.300
And I don't know if I'm going to
find another bird to marry.

03:19.333 --> 03:21.669
She's going to have questions.
She's going to think I'm stupid.

03:24.272 --> 03:26.307
This doesn't solve everything.

03:28.642 --> 03:30.344
JIMMY:
It is good, though.

03:30.378 --> 03:33.647
What do they put in it
to make it taste so sweet?

03:39.353 --> 03:41.689
Hello.

03:41.722 --> 03:44.858
Welcome to High School
Equivalency Class.

03:48.362 --> 03:50.631
"I don't know"
is not an answer, Mr. Chance.

03:50.664 --> 03:53.267
It's Drakkar Noir.

03:53.301 --> 03:54.902
I hate this class.

03:54.935 --> 03:57.305
I want to live in
a classless society.

03:57.338 --> 03:58.472
Okay, you're mixing up
two different uses

03:58.506 --> 04:00.308
of the word "class."

04:00.341 --> 04:02.643
Man, why do you always have to
correct everything when I talk?

04:02.676 --> 04:05.779
It's "when I speak,"
and it's my job.

04:05.813 --> 04:07.381
Well, correct this.

04:07.415 --> 04:09.350
I quit.

04:09.383 --> 04:11.619
I don't need high school.

04:11.652 --> 04:13.321
I'm gonna be a famous artist

04:13.354 --> 04:18.025
like Picasso or Ed Hardy
or Vincent van...

04:18.058 --> 04:19.660
uh, van...
Gogh.

04:19.693 --> 04:22.062
I'm going! God.

04:22.095 --> 04:25.065
Come on, Venom,
we're out of here.

04:25.098 --> 04:27.335
Dude, did you not read
the restraining order?

04:27.368 --> 04:28.969
Stop talking to me,
and change your clothes.

04:29.002 --> 04:31.939
You're embarrassing
an entire movement.

04:31.972 --> 04:34.475
Cool.

04:34.508 --> 04:35.476
I'll see you at the mall.

04:37.678 --> 04:39.647
(sotto voce):
Please don't recognize me,
please don't recognize me...

04:39.680 --> 04:41.482
SWIFT:
Rebecca Asher?

04:45.653 --> 04:47.755
Drakkar Noir?

04:47.788 --> 04:50.591
Present.

04:50.624 --> 04:53.994
Great. And I trust you remember
Venom, Queen of the Night?

04:54.027 --> 04:56.397
Now known as Venom,
queen of the night shift

04:56.430 --> 04:57.365
at the Burger Barn.

04:58.932 --> 05:00.901
Don't get any ideas.

05:00.934 --> 05:02.636
I still have the
restraining order.

05:08.576 --> 05:12.480
Now we're gonna do
a little math problem.

05:12.513 --> 05:15.048
If Jimmy Chance dropped
out of high school

05:15.082 --> 05:21.054
in 2005 and comes back in 2012
to get his G.E.D. diploma,

05:21.088 --> 05:23.957
how many years of his life
has Jimmy Chance wasted?

05:25.393 --> 05:26.760
Yes, Jimmy Chance?

05:26.794 --> 05:28.729
Seven?
Wrong.

05:28.762 --> 05:31.098
You won't know how many years
of your life you wasted

05:31.131 --> 05:34.067
until your miserable
life is over.

05:35.002 --> 05:37.905
Now, going into geography.

05:37.938 --> 05:40.741
If Jimmy Chance should
die in a gutter,

05:40.774 --> 05:43.143
drowning in a puddle
of his own sick,

05:43.176 --> 05:46.714
in the city of Santiago,

05:46.747 --> 05:47.915
what country would he be in?

05:47.948 --> 05:49.683
Anyone?

05:49.717 --> 05:51.118
Yes, Jimmy Chance?

05:51.151 --> 05:52.119
I don't know the answer.

05:52.152 --> 05:54.121
I was just wondering if
you could stop using me

05:54.154 --> 05:55.423
as an example in
all of your questions?

05:55.456 --> 05:59.126
No. The correct answer
is "Chile."

05:59.159 --> 06:00.794
(school bell rings)

06:00.828 --> 06:03.397
All right. Don't forget to read
the first three chapters

06:03.431 --> 06:05.165
in your Earth Science book.

06:05.198 --> 06:08.969
That would be chapters
one, two, and three.

06:09.002 --> 06:10.538
I'll see you all next week,

06:10.571 --> 06:13.441
except for Jimmy Chance, who
I'm sure will quit by then.

06:17.511 --> 06:19.012
(ice-cream truck music
playing outside)

06:19.046 --> 06:20.714
Hey, how's
the studying going?

06:20.748 --> 06:22.450
Oh, not too good.

06:22.483 --> 06:24.518
I'm thinking about asking
Sabrina to help tutor me.

06:24.552 --> 06:26.487
No, no, no, no, no, no.
You can't do that.

06:26.520 --> 06:27.888
Jimmy, girls like guys

06:27.921 --> 06:29.523
who are dumb
and handsome,
Mm-hmm.

06:29.557 --> 06:31.158
not really dumb
and pleasant-looking.

06:31.191 --> 06:33.461
And we have worked way
too hard to keep Sabrina

06:33.494 --> 06:34.828
from finding out
how stupid you are.

06:34.862 --> 06:36.497
If she's helping you study,

06:36.530 --> 06:38.632
there's no way we're going to
be able to bail you out.

06:38.666 --> 06:40.200
You guys don't
bail me out that much.

06:40.233 --> 06:42.936
We bailed you out last week.

06:45.138 --> 06:46.206
Hey, Jimmy.

06:46.239 --> 06:48.175
Barney told me to tell you
we're going to need capers.

06:48.208 --> 06:51.011
Sure. Capers.
Coming right up.

06:53.481 --> 06:55.583
(phone ringing)

06:57.485 --> 06:58.151
Yeah.

06:59.753 --> 07:02.623
VIRGINIA:
Burt, we got a word!

07:02.656 --> 07:03.924
Damn it!

07:07.961 --> 07:10.063
What's the word?

07:11.632 --> 07:12.733
Capers.

07:12.766 --> 07:14.067
"C" or a "K"?

07:14.101 --> 07:17.204
Try "K," no... "C."
It seems like a sneaky word.

07:19.707 --> 07:21.475
Where'd everything
on that shelf go?

07:21.509 --> 07:23.143
I don't know.

07:23.176 --> 07:24.912
Looks like there was a caper.

07:24.945 --> 07:27.214
(cell phone rings)

07:27.247 --> 07:28.716
Hello?

07:28.749 --> 07:30.884
It's a food.
It's a food!

07:30.918 --> 07:33.687
VIRGINIA:
We found another definition.

07:33.721 --> 07:34.387
BURT:
Why are there

07:34.421 --> 07:35.789
two definitions for one word?

07:35.823 --> 07:37.958
Just make up new words!

07:37.991 --> 07:40.828
"Mapers"... "flapers"...

07:40.861 --> 07:42.029
it's so easy to fix!

07:42.062 --> 07:43.997
"Fronge," there's another word!

07:44.031 --> 07:45.098
Look at that.

07:46.600 --> 07:49.269
Uh, here are the pickled
buds of the Mediterranean

07:49.302 --> 07:51.271
Capparis spinosa bush
you asked for.

07:51.304 --> 07:53.507
Oh, thank you.

07:53.541 --> 07:55.576
I hope I didn't confuse you
before with my joke.

07:55.609 --> 07:57.645
I thought for a second
you were going crazy.

07:57.678 --> 07:59.046
No, I just love a good wordplay.

07:59.079 --> 08:00.814
You're a regular James Joyce.

08:00.848 --> 08:03.116
(phone rings)

08:04.084 --> 08:05.953
Hello?

08:05.986 --> 08:08.021
Burt! James Joyce!

08:08.055 --> 08:08.989
Damn it!

08:15.829 --> 08:17.865
Okay, you guys
bail me out a lot.

08:17.898 --> 08:20.968
But the G.E.D. exam is about
normal stuff like math.

08:21.001 --> 08:22.269
And I know enough
about that stuff

08:22.302 --> 08:24.004
to not embarrass myself
in front of Sabrina.

08:24.037 --> 08:27.240
Go ahead,
ask me a basic math question.

08:27.274 --> 08:29.577
Okay, okay...

08:31.311 --> 08:33.747
Okay...

08:33.781 --> 08:35.015
Oh, my God.

08:35.048 --> 08:38.085
We're too stupid to even
think of a question.

08:38.118 --> 08:42.656
Maw Maw, come here and
ask Jimmy a math question.

08:42.690 --> 08:46.694
If the radius of a circle
is six, what is the area?

08:46.727 --> 08:50.330
A math question, Maw Maw.

08:50.363 --> 08:52.065
That is math.

08:52.099 --> 08:54.902
The formula is
"pi r squared."

08:54.935 --> 08:56.637
Is she even lucid right now?

08:56.670 --> 08:57.738
Square pies...

08:57.771 --> 08:59.707
I think there are
squares in math.

08:59.740 --> 09:01.809
But pies are round.
Cobbler's square.

09:01.842 --> 09:04.211
Lemon squares are square.
Mm-hmm.

09:04.244 --> 09:06.146
Brownies are those
long, thin squares.

09:06.179 --> 09:07.981
Well, I could use
something sweet, right now.

09:08.015 --> 09:09.116
Anybody else hungry?

09:09.149 --> 09:09.883
I could eat.

09:11.752 --> 09:13.754
Burt, get out here.

09:13.787 --> 09:17.157
There's a dog on TV
that can bark dirty words.

09:18.158 --> 09:19.326
What's that?

09:19.359 --> 09:21.128
Ah... pillows.

09:21.161 --> 09:23.597
Under the pillows.

09:23.631 --> 09:24.965
Uh...

09:24.998 --> 09:27.367
It's a little machine
that makes a fart noise.

09:27.400 --> 09:29.236
I was going to play
a little trick on you later.

09:29.269 --> 09:31.171
Make it make the noise.

09:47.955 --> 09:50.123
Batteries must be dead
on this thing.

09:50.157 --> 09:53.026
What are you hiding under there?

09:55.863 --> 09:57.297
That's one of
Jimmy's smart books.

09:59.099 --> 10:00.367
What is your game, mister?

10:00.400 --> 10:02.335
I don't want Jimmy
to get smarter than me.

10:02.369 --> 10:05.906
Well, if you get smart,
then I'll be the dumbest one.

10:05.939 --> 10:08.876
And I'm not going from the "Moe"
to the "Curly" in this trio.

10:08.909 --> 10:10.944
Just put down the book
and go watch TV.

10:10.978 --> 10:12.145
And nothing smart.

10:12.179 --> 10:14.381
No PBS and no NBC sitcoms.

10:14.414 --> 10:16.817
Hey. You guys aren't
gonna believe this.

10:16.850 --> 10:18.285
There is a "pi" in math.

10:18.318 --> 10:22.055
It's a squiggly line held up
by two little sticks.

10:22.089 --> 10:23.924
What are you doing
with my Science book?

10:23.957 --> 10:27.828
I don't want Hope to think I'm
the dumbest one in the house.

10:27.861 --> 10:29.930
Fine. We'll both
get our G.E.D. diplomas,

10:29.963 --> 10:32.365
and Mom can be the dumb one.
Is that okay with you, Mom?

10:32.399 --> 10:35.102
Hell no, it's not okay
with me.

10:35.135 --> 10:36.403
You guys get your G.E.D.'s,

10:36.436 --> 10:38.672
it'll be like the
three blind mice,

10:38.706 --> 10:41.408
only two of them got their eyes
fixed with that latex surgery

10:41.441 --> 10:43.276
and I'll be the only one
bumping into things.

10:43.310 --> 10:45.212
I want to get
my G.E.D., too.

10:45.245 --> 10:47.414
Oh, no, no, no, no, no.
If you're all educated,

10:47.447 --> 10:49.883
I go back to being the dumbest
one in the house again.

10:49.917 --> 10:51.719
That's always gonna
be the case, Jimmy.

10:51.752 --> 10:53.386
Just like how the sky
will always be blue

10:53.420 --> 10:55.255
because of the angle at which
the solar illumination

10:55.288 --> 10:56.990
travels through the atmosphere.

10:57.958 --> 10:59.392
Give me that damn book!

11:04.965 --> 11:07.034
Good evening.

11:07.067 --> 11:09.837
(sotto voce):
Mr. Swift teaches
this class?

11:09.870 --> 11:12.172
(whispers):
Do you think
he'll remember us?

11:14.942 --> 11:18.178
Ladies and Virginia,

11:18.211 --> 11:19.880
could you take
your seats, please?

11:21.749 --> 11:23.350
You're just jealous

11:23.383 --> 11:25.018
because people find my belly
more interesting

11:25.052 --> 11:28.255
than your stupid
quadradical equations.

11:28.288 --> 11:29.957
I'm making a human bean!

11:29.990 --> 11:31.424
What are you doing?

11:31.458 --> 11:34.194
I'm just trying to prepare
people for the future.

11:34.227 --> 11:36.764
Unlike you and your idiot
boyfriend here,

11:36.797 --> 11:39.066
some of these people
still have a future.

11:39.099 --> 11:41.501
Oh, we have a future.

11:41.534 --> 11:43.737
I'm gonna be a stay-at-home mom,

11:43.771 --> 11:46.740
and Burt is gonna
be a stay-at-home rock star.

11:46.774 --> 11:50.343
And the last thing we're gonna
need is your stupid math!

11:54.481 --> 11:55.983
(spits)

11:56.016 --> 11:57.785
Smell you later, chump.

11:59.552 --> 12:02.289
So, tonight we will be covering

12:02.322 --> 12:04.191
a wide range of...

12:06.193 --> 12:09.429
Oh, I don't believe my eyes.

12:09.462 --> 12:13.466
If it isn't the foul-mouthed,
pregnant girl and the boy

12:13.500 --> 12:15.869
who thought it was hilarious

12:15.903 --> 12:18.271
to draw genitalia
in my textbooks.

12:18.305 --> 12:20.273
We've changed a lot since then.

12:20.307 --> 12:22.342
How you doing?

12:24.044 --> 12:30.383
If "X" equals "Y,"
then these two lines are...?

12:32.152 --> 12:32.986
Burt?

12:33.020 --> 12:34.321
Red.

12:34.354 --> 12:38.091
True, but I was looking
for "parallel."

12:38.125 --> 12:40.961
This is a "right triangle."

12:40.994 --> 12:43.196
What kind of triangle is this?

12:48.501 --> 12:50.003
Wrong triangle.

12:50.037 --> 12:51.204
Idiot.

12:51.238 --> 12:53.073
Left triangle!
(gags)

12:53.106 --> 12:56.209
Can anyone tell me what
happened in the Bay of Pigs?

12:57.510 --> 13:00.547
There were no actual pigs
involved.

13:02.382 --> 13:04.985
It was becoming clear to us
that if we were gonna get

13:05.018 --> 13:07.087
our G.E.D.'s, we were going to

13:07.120 --> 13:09.522
have to get some extra help
outside of class.

13:09.556 --> 13:11.825
So I decided to ask Sabrina
for help,

13:11.859 --> 13:14.561
which meant confessing to her
how stupid I really am.

13:14.594 --> 13:17.064
Listen, don't beat yourself up

13:17.097 --> 13:18.966
just because as far as
traditional education goes,

13:18.999 --> 13:21.034
you might not exactly be ahead
of the curve.

13:21.068 --> 13:22.602
I think it's "curb."
"Ahead of the curb,"

13:22.635 --> 13:25.005
because when you park, you
don't want to hit the curb.

13:25.038 --> 13:26.339
You want to stay ahead of it.

13:26.373 --> 13:28.241
When's this test?

13:28.275 --> 13:29.476
Next Tuesday.

13:29.509 --> 13:31.378
We should start.

13:31.411 --> 13:33.080
Dad went looking for Barney
to help him

13:33.113 --> 13:35.015
but didn't know it was
his day off,

13:35.048 --> 13:37.450
and caught Frank pretending
to be the boss

13:37.484 --> 13:40.220
and interviewing for a large-
breasted personal assistant.

13:40.253 --> 13:42.589
In exchange for Dad not telling
Barney or reporting him

13:42.622 --> 13:45.926
to the authorities,
Frank agreed to help Dad study.

13:48.361 --> 13:50.530
And Mom thought that if she
could catch Maw Maw

13:50.563 --> 13:53.133
when she was lucid,
she'd be the perfect tutor.

13:53.166 --> 13:56.003
For the first time in our
lives, we were all eager
to learn.

13:56.036 --> 13:57.270
So which one's heavier?

13:57.304 --> 13:59.973
Sand.
Why?

14:00.007 --> 14:02.309
Because the sand has a higher
density than grass.

14:02.342 --> 14:04.244
Great. Now volume.

14:04.277 --> 14:09.116
Because sand has a higher
density than grass!

14:13.120 --> 14:15.522
"Do you bite your thumb
at us, sir?"

14:15.555 --> 14:18.158
"I do bite my thumb, sir."

14:18.191 --> 14:20.227
Oh, this is boring!

14:20.260 --> 14:21.494
Boring?

14:21.528 --> 14:23.330
They're about to stab

14:23.363 --> 14:24.497
each other's lungs
out with swords.

14:24.531 --> 14:25.933
Does your copy have pictures?

14:25.966 --> 14:27.968
'Cause mine just has
a lot of words.

14:28.001 --> 14:29.970
No, the pictures are in my head.

14:30.003 --> 14:33.373
Oh... I just keep picturing
the words floating around.

14:33.406 --> 14:35.675
Ah, there goes "thumb."

14:35.708 --> 14:36.944
Well, don't do that.

14:36.977 --> 14:39.079
That's really stupid.

14:39.112 --> 14:40.580
Just picture the
guys fighting.

14:40.613 --> 14:42.582
Make a movie in your mind.

14:42.615 --> 14:46.519
"Draw, if you be men."

14:49.022 --> 14:49.957
Yeah!

14:49.990 --> 14:52.125
I see 'em!
I see the guys!

14:52.159 --> 14:54.194
(laughs) They're wearing tights!

14:54.227 --> 14:55.929
One of 'em's got a hat

14:55.963 --> 14:57.230
with a purple feather in it.

14:57.264 --> 14:59.632
The other one looks like that
detective from Roger Rabbit.

14:59.666 --> 15:01.068
Bob Hoskins.
Yeah, yeah!

15:01.101 --> 15:02.469
Keep reading.

15:02.502 --> 15:05.638
"Gregory, remember
thy swashing blow."

15:05.672 --> 15:07.607
Ooh! The Bob Hoskins guy
just took a swing

15:07.640 --> 15:09.042
at the guy in the hat.

15:09.076 --> 15:11.178
Oh, it is on now!

15:11.211 --> 15:12.579
Oh, there goes the word
"thumb" again.

15:12.612 --> 15:14.948
Get out of here, thumb!

15:14.982 --> 15:18.651
* The British ran like sissies

15:18.685 --> 15:21.021
* When we threw away their tea
and won the... *

15:21.054 --> 15:25.325
* Revolutionary War in 1783

15:25.358 --> 15:30.030
* It would've ended sooner
if Nixon dropped the bomb *

15:30.063 --> 15:35.635
* But it wasn't until 1973
that we got out of Vietnam. *

15:35.668 --> 15:36.903
Eventually all the stuff

15:36.936 --> 15:39.172
they were trying to teach us
kind of became fun,

15:39.206 --> 15:41.975
which I guess is why it started
to stick in our heads.

15:42.009 --> 15:44.511
So the centrifugal force
is the one pushing you out,

15:44.544 --> 15:47.347
and the centripetal force
is the one pushing you in.

15:47.380 --> 15:50.383
I'm sorry it took me so long,
but I think I get it.

15:54.687 --> 15:56.689
(both yelling and grunting)

15:59.026 --> 16:00.693
(groans)
"I am hurt.

16:00.727 --> 16:02.595
"A plague o' both
your houses!

16:02.629 --> 16:04.664
I am spent."

16:07.400 --> 16:10.770
See, by "houses," Shakespeare
doesn't mean "buildings."

16:10.803 --> 16:12.405
He means the
two families.

16:12.439 --> 16:13.440
They hate each other.

16:13.473 --> 16:15.008
I don't know if
you ever saw

16:15.042 --> 16:16.209
the soap opera
Santa Barbara,

16:16.243 --> 16:17.777
but it's pretty
much the same.

16:17.810 --> 16:19.779
Excuse me.
Are one of you Frank Howdy?

16:19.812 --> 16:22.082
I'm here to apply
for the wiener-sampling job.

16:22.115 --> 16:23.750
Just wait in my office.

16:23.783 --> 16:25.685
I'll be right with you.

16:25.718 --> 16:30.123
* That evil Saddam Hussein was
a thorn in Dubya's paw *

16:30.157 --> 16:32.592
* So we ran him out of Baghdad

16:32.625 --> 16:35.195
* In a night of shock and awe

16:35.228 --> 16:39.666
* And that was every war
in American history *

16:39.699 --> 16:42.335
* Now I can't wait to see
who we fight *

16:42.369 --> 16:45.505
* When it comes
to World War Three. *

16:45.538 --> 16:49.342
So we decided to put all our
hardwork to a practice test.

16:49.376 --> 16:51.044
It didn't matter
who scored highest,

16:51.078 --> 16:53.413
but we were all going
to laugh like hell

16:53.446 --> 16:56.249
at whoever scored lowest.

16:56.283 --> 16:57.284
(whistle blows)

17:02.555 --> 17:05.525
Well, one of you passed.

17:05.558 --> 17:06.826
In your face!

17:06.859 --> 17:08.361
It wasn't you.

17:09.462 --> 17:10.530
Jimmy's dad,

17:10.563 --> 17:12.299
you let me down.

17:12.332 --> 17:14.567
Not only as a tutor,
but as a best friend.

17:17.670 --> 17:20.507
Well, it's down
to you and me now.

17:20.540 --> 17:22.209
Virginia, you failed, too.

17:22.242 --> 17:25.212
Virginia, you're grounded.

17:25.245 --> 17:27.514
You've lost your cassette-player
privileges.

17:27.547 --> 17:29.849
Yes!
I'm the smartest.

17:29.882 --> 17:31.784
Not quite.
You failed, too.

17:31.818 --> 17:34.321
Hope was actually
the only one that passed.

17:34.354 --> 17:36.423
We graded the little
answer sheet she was

17:36.456 --> 17:37.657
doodling on just for fun.

17:37.690 --> 17:38.725
That kid's really
starting

17:38.758 --> 17:40.827
to get on my nerves.

17:40.860 --> 17:43.696
It's useless. I'll never
be smarter than Hope.

17:43.730 --> 17:46.633
I can't believe
we all studied, and we still

17:46.666 --> 17:48.835
got beat by a baby who filled in
the dots randomly.

17:48.868 --> 17:50.870
What if it
wasn't random?

17:50.903 --> 17:53.606
What if she's some kind
of super genius?

17:53.640 --> 17:56.576
Hope, what is 3.14?

17:59.612 --> 18:03.483
Oh, my God, she knew
the number for pi.

18:03.516 --> 18:05.218
Or she's pointing out
that we haven't fed her

18:05.252 --> 18:07.520
in seven hours while
we were all busy failing

18:07.554 --> 18:08.655
this stupid practice test.

18:08.688 --> 18:10.857
Either way, we're idiots.

18:16.729 --> 18:19.132
I got a 90
in math.

18:19.166 --> 18:21.468
That's out of 800, Mom.
That's a terrible score.

18:21.501 --> 18:24.804
Oh. That makes me feel less good
about my 70 in English.

18:24.837 --> 18:25.772
Well, you beat me.

18:25.805 --> 18:27.840
I tanked everything
except math and science.

18:27.874 --> 18:29.576
I got a 500 in English.

18:29.609 --> 18:31.378
I did pretty good.
Mm.

18:31.411 --> 18:32.812
I mean "pretty well."

18:32.845 --> 18:35.915
Ugh! That's probably
another ten points right there.

18:35.948 --> 18:38.685
Yeah, my science
and history was a disaster.

18:38.718 --> 18:40.853
A disaster like
the great Chicago Fire?

18:40.887 --> 18:44.624
Or Chamberlain giving up
Poland to Hitler?

18:44.657 --> 18:47.260
That's my fancy way of saying
I did good in history.

18:47.294 --> 18:48.261
Wait a second.

18:48.295 --> 18:50.530
Oh, I think we're covered.
Dad, you remember

18:50.563 --> 18:51.898
that TV show you made me watch

18:51.931 --> 18:53.666
about the tough guy
with the silver hair?

18:53.700 --> 18:54.701
Maude?

18:54.734 --> 18:55.835
No, it had people in a van,

18:55.868 --> 18:57.370
lot of running around...

18:57.404 --> 18:58.905
Action News?
Scooby-Doo?

18:58.938 --> 19:00.440
No, no, it had that
theme song that went...

19:00.473 --> 19:01.574
* Drummy-drum-drum!

19:01.608 --> 19:03.676
Then... * Da-da-dah.

19:03.710 --> 19:04.344
The A-Team.

19:04.377 --> 19:05.412
Yeah!
On the A-Team

19:05.445 --> 19:07.847
each guy would have a different
job on the caper.

19:07.880 --> 19:09.582
Caper!
Caper!
Caper!

19:09.616 --> 19:13.253
Anyway, we could all be like
Hope's learning A-Team.

19:14.621 --> 19:15.955
I'll teach history;

19:15.988 --> 19:17.557
you teach math.

19:17.590 --> 19:18.925
I call demolitions expert.
Yes!

19:18.958 --> 19:20.227
You're teaching English.

19:20.260 --> 19:21.794
Oh.

19:21.828 --> 19:23.696
(sighs)

19:23.730 --> 19:24.797
You all right?

19:24.831 --> 19:26.866
I guess.

19:26.899 --> 19:30.470
I mean... I'm happy
we're gonna make this
work out for Hope,

19:30.503 --> 19:33.640
but I hate giving Mr. Swift
the satisfaction of knowing

19:33.673 --> 19:35.208
he was right about me
quitting again.

19:35.242 --> 19:37.544
Or...

19:39.446 --> 19:41.681
we can get the A-Team on it.

19:43.483 --> 19:45.452
Yeah, Jimmy, it sounds like you
have a problem

19:45.485 --> 19:46.953
no one else can solve.

19:46.986 --> 19:49.856
We knew
that none of us were capable

19:49.889 --> 19:51.624
of passing that test
on our own.

19:51.658 --> 19:54.961
We just needed to figure out
how I could pass it.

19:56.863 --> 19:59.899
The first section is math
and science,

19:59.932 --> 20:03.870
which will be very important
in your careers,

20:03.903 --> 20:06.306
whether it's making change
or making meth.

20:06.339 --> 20:08.808
Mr. Swift thought nobody
could figure out a way

20:08.841 --> 20:11.978
to cheat on his test.

20:12.011 --> 20:14.581
But he didn't realize that

20:14.614 --> 20:16.783
he was up against the A-Team
of cheating.

20:16.816 --> 20:19.419
This section is English.

20:19.452 --> 20:21.721
Since each of us was good
at one subject,

20:21.754 --> 20:24.557
if we just put the same name
on the right answer sheet

20:24.591 --> 20:27.760
at the right time...

20:27.794 --> 20:29.929
The next part is social studies.

20:29.962 --> 20:32.865
...one person was gonna be good
at all of them.

20:39.539 --> 20:43.743
Well, it kills me to say it,
but I was wrong.

20:43.776 --> 20:46.012
You scored 90%.

20:46.045 --> 20:47.847
Congratulations.

20:47.880 --> 20:50.483
You've earned your
G.E.D. diploma.

20:50.517 --> 20:55.322
Which is amazing to me because
you're the child of two morons

20:55.355 --> 20:59.726
who just posted the lowest score
in the history of the G.E.D.

20:59.759 --> 21:01.361
Well, what can I say?

21:01.394 --> 21:03.530
Some of us are good
at taking tests,

21:03.563 --> 21:06.633
some of us are good
at raising smart children.

21:06.666 --> 21:09.369
We can't all be good
at everything.

21:09.402 --> 21:11.304
Smell you later, chump.

21:11.338 --> 21:13.440
At first I was worried
that Hope was gonna think

21:13.473 --> 21:14.941
I was a complete dummy.

21:14.974 --> 21:16.776
But actually,
I'm just part dummy

21:16.809 --> 21:18.811
like the rest of my family.

21:18.845 --> 21:23.716
But altogether,
we make a smarty,

21:23.750 --> 21:24.884
just like Hope.

21:29.722 --> 21:31.758
I love it when
a plan comes together.

21:35.895 --> 21:38.731
Monkey tail-- I like it!
