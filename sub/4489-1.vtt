00:30.717 --> 00:35.397
My pops used to always say,
''Dreaming is the luxury of children ''...

00:35.597 --> 00:38.197
...and that I should enjoy it.

00:38.397 --> 00:39.877
He was right.

00:40.077 --> 00:43.838
Here it is, the last year of high school
for me and my friends...

00:44.038 --> 00:46.837
...and this is all I can
ever really see myself doing.

00:47.037 --> 00:50.877
When you got responsibilities,
you ain't got time to dream.

00:53.357 --> 00:57.797
I guess it's the difference between
being a boy and a man.

01:00.118 --> 01:01.118
And down South...

01:02.518 --> 01:03.838
...you grow up quick.

01:04.078 --> 01:06.718
Especially in the ATL.

02:52.199 --> 02:53.999
This here is my 'hood.

02:53.999 --> 02:55.919
Mechanicsville.

02:55.919 --> 02:57.800
752 Mandeville Lane.

02:59.000 --> 03:02.920
Middle of the city, center of our universe.

03:10.320 --> 03:13.960
Wake up, ATL, it's 6:23.
It's your boy, Frank Ski in the morning.

03:13.960 --> 03:17.321
And we've got another scorcher planned
for you here in the Dirty South.

03:17.561 --> 03:20.161
I'm talking Dirty South hot
ATL weather today.

03:20.401 --> 03:23.600
I tell you what, another heat index,
another record-breaking day.

03:25.880 --> 03:27.680
''What is your ethnic background?''

03:27.880 --> 03:29.120
I am a brother.

03:30.560 --> 03:31.880
Uncle George,
my mama's brother.

03:32.080 --> 03:33.920
He supposed to be raising us...

03:33.920 --> 03:36.761
...but responsibility was not really
his strong point.

03:36.961 --> 03:39.561
''Bisex-- Heterosexual.''

03:39.761 --> 03:41.081
Don't get it twisted, baby.

03:43.081 --> 03:46.801
Hey, Ant. You want a ride, homeboy,
you better act like it.

03:47.001 --> 03:48.961
-That's my little brother, Ant.
-All right.

03:48.961 --> 03:50.081
I call him ''Jellybean. ''

03:51.521 --> 03:53.761
Hardheaded on the outside,
soft on the inside.

03:54.001 --> 03:54.960
And that's me, Rashad.

03:56.201 --> 04:00.321
Heir to the family business,
Swann Cleaning Service...

04:00.521 --> 04:02.961
...and man of the house.

04:04.841 --> 04:07.041
''How would you describe your physique?

04:08.241 --> 04:12.641
Trim, muscular, pleasantly plump.''

04:12.841 --> 04:15.682
-What?
-Hey, let us get a box of cereal, man.

04:15.882 --> 04:17.601
We ran out.

04:17.922 --> 04:20.281
Man, they always eating.

04:22.402 --> 04:24.042
Muscular.

04:25.682 --> 04:27.321
I know how much is in there too.

04:27.561 --> 04:29.441
One bowl each.

04:29.881 --> 04:30.961
Yeah.

04:36.482 --> 04:38.042
My boy, Esquire.

04:39.442 --> 04:42.882
He's basically my best friend.
He got accepted to an Ivy League school.

04:42.882 --> 04:44.082
There goes four.

04:44.282 --> 04:48.002
Check out this brother, just grinning,
jogging through campus with a white girl.

04:48.402 --> 04:51.562
Probably running from that crowd of
white boys on the opposite page.

04:52.842 --> 04:56.403
Either way you look at it, man, you lucky.

04:56.643 --> 04:59.122
Yeah, man. It ain't paid for yet.

04:59.362 --> 05:03.402
I'm gonna need grants, loans,
a job and a dream to pay this tuition off.

05:04.322 --> 05:05.602
''Ex-blackly.''

05:09.882 --> 05:12.682
We had to drive across town
because E went to Mount Paran.

05:12.882 --> 05:14.563
My boy book smart...

05:14.763 --> 05:17.563
...maybe even borderline brilliant
to these kids...

05:17.763 --> 05:19.763
...but he's just plain old Esquire to us.

05:19.963 --> 05:21.643
Why you always be driving in our car?

05:21.843 --> 05:23.003
-Get out the car.
-Look, boy.

05:23.203 --> 05:25.203
With your stupid little outfit, man.

05:25.403 --> 05:27.803
Rashad, I'm gonna hurt him.

05:28.243 --> 05:29.922
Man, get out of here.

05:30.322 --> 05:32.883
-Peace.
-You mean ''War,'' brother.

05:33.123 --> 05:34.363
War!

05:34.763 --> 05:36.403
-How you doing, Mr. Sapp?
-Hey, Ben.

05:38.163 --> 05:40.723
-Have a seat.
-Right.

05:43.123 --> 05:45.923
I got the information you wanted
regarding the Falcon Society.

05:46.123 --> 05:47.963
Let's have a look.

05:49.843 --> 05:52.243
GPA is over 4.0.

05:53.084 --> 05:55.084
Test scores are high.

05:56.244 --> 05:57.604
Essay's strong.

05:59.244 --> 06:01.443
All you need is a good letter
of recommendation.

06:01.643 --> 06:03.003
You're in great shape.

06:03.963 --> 06:05.883
I was wondering if
you could write that for me.

06:06.123 --> 06:09.483
I'm flattered, Ben, I am,
but I'm not really the right person.

06:09.683 --> 06:12.004
I'm sure your parents know a judge,
a businessman?

06:12.004 --> 06:15.004
I don't think my parents
know anybody like that, sir.

06:15.644 --> 06:17.964
Sometimes it's not what you know...

06:19.484 --> 06:21.404
...but who you know.

06:21.604 --> 06:23.444
Our school was a little different.

06:23.644 --> 06:26.684
See, we in the Trey, Mechanicsville High.

06:26.884 --> 06:30.964
Alma mater to some of
the greatest players in the city.

06:30.964 --> 06:32.924
That's my boy Teddy right there.

06:32.924 --> 06:34.884
He ATL for real.

06:34.884 --> 06:36.444
Never been outside of 285.

06:37.844 --> 06:40.844
Hey, what you doing here, man?
You must have lost your job.

06:40.844 --> 06:43.004
Had to get my breakfast on.
Brother gotta eat.

06:43.244 --> 06:44.484
Get it how you live, pimp.

06:46.924 --> 06:48.924
-Brooklyn, from New y ork.
-No means no, man.

06:48.924 --> 06:51.325
And reminds us of it every chance he get.

06:53.845 --> 06:56.165
-Shining, ain't you?
-Can't you tell, man?

06:56.365 --> 06:58.485
Guess you gonna fake it
till you make it, huh?

06:58.685 --> 07:00.565
Man, these gonna be getting me the girls.

07:00.765 --> 07:02.924
-Not without no game, it ain't.
-What up, Tondie?

07:03.124 --> 07:05.244
-Can we talk right quick?
-Just did, bye.

07:06.524 --> 07:07.604
Working already.

07:11.485 --> 07:13.965
Seniors, it's almost graduation.

07:14.205 --> 07:17.525
If you haven't done it yet,
get your cap and gowns ordered.

07:17.725 --> 07:21.445
We were five weeks from graduation.
I had all my credits.

07:21.645 --> 07:25.765
And all I had to do was cruise for
the next month and I'd be straight.

07:25.965 --> 07:28.405
Please give them
a Tiger round of applause.

07:28.605 --> 07:29.886
And one more thing.

07:30.686 --> 07:34.245
We have a lot of sports
going on this week.

07:34.445 --> 07:35.965
And we want to thank the people...

07:36.165 --> 07:39.725
-...who were involved this weekend.
-Everybody in a seat.

07:44.885 --> 07:47.925
Year's almost over. Thank you, Jesus.

07:49.846 --> 07:52.886
Y'all slackers better figure out
what to do for the summer.

07:52.886 --> 07:55.206
My little brother wasn't exactly
a troublemaker.

07:55.406 --> 07:57.886
-That ain't right.
-But he ran his mouth too much.

07:57.886 --> 08:00.206
-Why ain't it?
-And he was definitely hardheaded.

08:00.406 --> 08:02.566
I know what I'll be doing this summer.

08:02.766 --> 08:04.086
I'm gonna be getting paid.

08:06.205 --> 08:07.965
Ms. Jackson...

08:08.245 --> 08:11.006
...can you please cut on the a.c.?

08:11.766 --> 08:13.766
Man, it feel like a slave ship in here.

08:15.486 --> 08:18.006
Air conditioning is for honors classes.

08:18.246 --> 08:20.726
Kids who wanna make something
out of themselves.

08:20.926 --> 08:23.006
Was you in honors classes?

08:23.246 --> 08:25.806
Because you ain't got no a.c. either.

08:26.486 --> 08:27.966
See what I'm saying?

08:27.966 --> 08:30.007
He stayed in trouble.

08:32.967 --> 08:35.366
But I couldn't wait on him
to get out of detention.

08:35.567 --> 08:37.006
We had to scoop Teddy.

08:41.966 --> 08:43.206
How your sister doing, man?

08:43.405 --> 08:45.966
I been calling her,
and she ain't been calling me back.

08:46.166 --> 08:48.487
She trying to play me?
She seeing somebody else?

08:48.687 --> 08:50.847
Come on, man, keep it real with me.

08:51.647 --> 08:53.967
What's happening, Teddy?

08:54.887 --> 08:56.647
-What up, man? You playing?
-I got next.

08:56.847 --> 08:58.887
Party on the left, man.
You know how it is.

08:59.087 --> 09:01.047
Now open wide, wide, wide.

09:01.287 --> 09:03.927
Bite down on that. Cool, cool.

09:04.127 --> 09:05.767
Hey, man. Ready?

09:05.967 --> 09:07.967
Oh, hell, yeah. I'm gone.

09:08.167 --> 09:09.927
Hey, man, peace.

09:21.207 --> 09:25.047
After we pick up Teddy, we shoot on
over to the Shady Grove Country Club.

09:25.287 --> 09:27.008
That's where Esquire works.

09:27.048 --> 09:28.608
We expected him to be late...

09:28.848 --> 09:32.888
...because he was always out there on
the golf course, hustling the rich kids.

09:34.968 --> 09:39.008
Yes, yes, and yes.

09:40.847 --> 09:42.527
Oh, my God, I love poetry.

09:42.727 --> 09:44.327
I write in my diary every day.

09:44.527 --> 09:47.088
Oh, really?
Let me kick something for you.

09:47.888 --> 09:52.928
She sits there
Pain filling the back of her eyes

09:52.928 --> 09:54.848
Forcing them to leak

09:54.848 --> 09:58.048
So all I need to do is
I need to get your digits.

09:58.288 --> 10:00.288
Your daddy ain't around, is he?

10:00.528 --> 10:03.448
Even though her tolerance
Has reached its peak

10:03.648 --> 10:06.169
Now, look here, when you call me,
don't even trip, okay?

10:06.369 --> 10:08.329
If a lady answer the phone,
that's my mama.

10:08.529 --> 10:11.248
She staying with me
because she going through some things.

10:11.448 --> 10:13.088
She's so soft

10:13.528 --> 10:15.888
She could have been
The spokesperson for cotton

10:16.128 --> 10:19.008
You know, that's just little things
that I like do to...

10:19.008 --> 10:21.048
...because I like to throw stuff in the air.

10:21.248 --> 10:23.248
These guys don't know anything
about poetry.

10:23.448 --> 10:25.008
They're not really cultured.

10:25.008 --> 10:29.729
-Hey, what's up, Esquire, man?
-Man....

10:29.929 --> 10:32.329
-Hey, man.
-Will you all come on? Excuse me.

10:32.569 --> 10:35.489
-Can't you see I'm over here--
-You reciting poetry and shit.

10:35.689 --> 10:37.409
-Come on, man.
-Damn.

10:37.609 --> 10:40.729
-Can we go please? Please?
-Hey, man, scoot over, man. Please?

10:40.929 --> 10:43.288
You skinny enough. Scoot over, man!

10:43.488 --> 10:45.529
You always sit in the front.
Sit in the back.

10:45.729 --> 10:48.009
What the hell wrong with you,
Tiger Hood?

10:48.009 --> 10:49.289
Black Nicklaus?

10:50.689 --> 10:54.569
I think I miss home or whatever,
but, yo, it's so country out here, man.

10:54.769 --> 10:58.689
It's like the flies--
Why are there so many flies out here?

10:58.889 --> 11:01.169
-Man, I know you not gonna get into this.
-For real.

11:01.369 --> 11:04.130
Okay, so why is there a rat on
every corner in New York City?

11:04.370 --> 11:07.250
Why, after every sentence,
you call me ''shorty''?

11:07.450 --> 11:11.170
''Yo, shorty, shorty.'' I'm taller than you.

11:11.370 --> 11:12.650
Let me ask you this, then.

11:12.850 --> 11:15.809
In New York City, why y'all say,
''Yo, son,'' after every sentence?

11:16.009 --> 11:17.929
-I'm not your kid. I'm not your child.
-Right.

11:18.129 --> 11:19.409
Why I gotta be your son?

11:19.609 --> 11:21.049
-Money?
-B?

11:21.249 --> 11:24.770
I call you ''sun'' because you shine like one.

11:24.970 --> 11:27.690
-You feel me?
-Yeah, that was real sentimental, thanks.

11:31.530 --> 11:33.130
-Oh, hell, yeah.
-Thank you.

11:33.330 --> 11:34.850
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

11:35.250 --> 11:37.930
-Y'all need anything else?
-No, we all right.

11:37.970 --> 11:40.850
-Actually, let me get some iced tea?
-Sweet or unsweet?

11:40.890 --> 11:43.451
-Sweet.
-She choosing, huh, Brooklyn?

11:45.570 --> 11:46.850
Shut up.

11:47.290 --> 11:49.850
Brooklyn! Oh, good Lord!

11:49.850 --> 11:53.170
That ass fatter than
a swamp possum with the mumps.

11:53.370 --> 11:55.410
-Okay, you got a point.
-See what I'm saying?

11:55.610 --> 11:56.850
That's country.

11:56.850 --> 11:58.810
Y'all get y'all cap and gowns yet?

11:59.010 --> 12:01.650
-Oh, yeah, I got mine.
-I know you do.

12:02.010 --> 12:04.051
Yo, you sure you graduating, Teddy?

12:04.251 --> 12:07.291
Like, come on, for real, B,
just give it up. Like, come on, Teddy.

12:07.491 --> 12:09.371
That ain't funny, man. I'm trying.

12:09.571 --> 12:11.211
-Wait a minute.
-I'm trying.

12:11.451 --> 12:13.451
Ain't you about
in the 1 4th grade now, dog?

12:13.971 --> 12:16.730
Yeah, I'm in the same class
with your mama.

12:16.930 --> 12:18.530
By the way, I ain't seen her lately.

12:18.730 --> 12:22.010
You gotta tell her to come in and
check in with Daddy at the house.

12:22.211 --> 12:24.091
I need my money on time.

12:24.291 --> 12:28.051
Hey, don't make jokes about me, okay?
I'm sensitive.

12:28.251 --> 12:30.891
Y'all know where that girl New New
go to school at?

12:30.891 --> 12:33.291
Seem like she only be around
when we be kicking it.

12:33.491 --> 12:36.171
-She ghetto, man.
-Yeah, boy, just how I like them.

12:37.331 --> 12:39.731
You better lean back, shorty.

12:39.971 --> 12:41.572
You know she Rashad's girl.

12:42.212 --> 12:44.652
-Rashad.
-Now, how you figure that?

12:44.892 --> 12:46.212
-Come on, man.
-Come on, man.

12:46.412 --> 12:47.891
Shut up, you know you like her too.

12:49.011 --> 12:50.731
I don't even be talking to that girl.

12:54.931 --> 12:56.931
So why you just wave at her?

12:57.131 --> 12:59.411
Shut up, man.

12:59.611 --> 13:00.931
He put you out there, homeboy.

13:01.052 --> 13:03.572
We were all at the same place
in our lives...

13:03.772 --> 13:05.772
...trying to figure out what's next.

13:05.972 --> 13:09.012
The one thing I did know:
These were my friends.

13:09.012 --> 13:10.292
I could trust them.

13:10.492 --> 13:12.892
And Sunday night, we got loose.

13:53.012 --> 13:56.212
-That's right.
-Let's go and do the damn thing, man.

13:58.172 --> 13:59.452
-Let's do it.
-Big old head.

13:59.653 --> 14:00.613
Let's go.

14:00.853 --> 14:02.773
Sunday night at Cascade.

14:02.973 --> 14:04.533
Fine Georgia peaches and wet paint.

14:05.933 --> 14:08.013
It was a beautiful place to be.

14:09.373 --> 14:10.933
I'm gonna knock him out next time.

14:11.133 --> 14:14.013
We'd been coming to Cascade
since we were kids.

14:14.253 --> 14:15.253
What's up, man?

14:15.453 --> 14:19.974
I had my first fistfight here,
and my first kiss.

14:20.534 --> 14:21.933
We knew everybody...

14:22.133 --> 14:24.613
...from the security guards
to the hottest shorties.

14:25.853 --> 14:28.613
Rashad. Rashad!

14:28.853 --> 14:31.773
-I know you heard me.
-Don't he know chocolate melt in the heat?

14:31.973 --> 14:35.533
-I'm glad somebody recognize.
-Don't try to get no feel, neither.

14:35.733 --> 14:38.453
Girl, I got grandkids older than you.

14:38.654 --> 14:42.494
Cascade's is a rite of passage
to every kid in the A...

14:42.694 --> 14:46.134
...but for us, it was something more.

14:46.414 --> 14:48.694
All right, everybody,
let's get it on the floor.

14:48.894 --> 14:52.813
Y'all looking a little rusty tonight.
Y'all better be practicing out there.

14:53.013 --> 14:55.493
There's something wrong
with these wheels.

14:55.693 --> 14:58.134
Ain't nothing wrong with these wheels.
You can't skate.

14:58.374 --> 15:02.014
Inside here,
it's like all our problems don't exist.

15:02.254 --> 15:05.614
It's the only place where
we all felt like we could be free.

15:06.894 --> 15:08.814
Man, it's crazy out here tonight.

15:10.254 --> 15:13.734
Oh, yeah, y'all, here we go again.
Cascade's on a Sunday night.

15:13.934 --> 15:16.454
If you can't skate,
get your ass off the floor.

15:16.654 --> 15:18.935
If you got skills,
then, shorty, you got to prove it.

15:19.135 --> 15:23.255
School sucks, rent past due,
your girl left you.

15:23.455 --> 15:26.134
On Sunday night,
don't none of that matter.

15:26.334 --> 15:29.214
y ou could be
whoever you wanted to be here.

15:56.695 --> 15:58.655
Can't take black folks nowhere.

15:58.855 --> 16:01.255
Man, get off the floor.
Get off the floor.

16:01.495 --> 16:03.735
Handle that, Mr. Referee.

16:19.936 --> 16:22.816
Hello? Hello?

16:23.016 --> 16:25.216
-Who was that?
-I don't know. They keep hanging up.

16:25.416 --> 16:27.015
Star-69 them.

16:27.935 --> 16:29.815
Excuse me, I am not a ho.

16:53.296 --> 16:55.577
There's all kinds of characters here.

16:56.977 --> 16:58.736
y ou got the Cool Cats and they crew.

16:58.936 --> 17:00.376
y ou got the Fly Girls.

17:00.936 --> 17:02.936
And the D-boys is in here too.

17:03.136 --> 17:05.376
Somebody always dying from their clique.

17:06.056 --> 17:08.016
But nobody matters like the skate crew.

17:16.257 --> 17:17.217
And we were the Ones.

17:18.656 --> 17:20.297
This year, we was taking Skate Wars.

17:20.497 --> 17:21.977
Let's go, man.

17:53.217 --> 17:55.378
Even when the rink was crunk
on Sunday night...

17:57.978 --> 18:01.897
...sometimes I felt like
I was out there all by myself.

18:01.897 --> 18:03.857
Floating above it all.

18:04.057 --> 18:07.057
No lies, no pain...

18:07.937 --> 18:10.097
...and no worries about
what tomorrow might bring.

18:14.058 --> 18:16.418
Shantay, hurry up,
we got dance rehearsal.

18:18.058 --> 18:20.658
Guess you don't know nobody
no more, huh?

18:22.498 --> 18:23.498
Man.

18:24.298 --> 18:25.938
No, I guess not.

18:27.258 --> 18:29.938
I'm saying, Rashad,
you know I didn't mean what I said.

18:30.658 --> 18:33.978
Man, whatever. That don't even matter.

18:35.018 --> 18:37.578
Look, my mama not home.

18:38.818 --> 18:39.898
You wanna give me a ride?

18:41.418 --> 18:43.698
Man, your mama ain't never home.

18:45.018 --> 18:46.418
Take care, though.

18:49.858 --> 18:51.538
I ain't have time to mess with Tonya.

18:51.778 --> 18:54.219
If we was gonna win the war,
we was gonna need practice.

18:55.019 --> 18:56.459
Some of us more than others.

18:56.659 --> 18:59.299
-We have identified the weakest link.
-Shut up, boy.

18:59.539 --> 19:01.779
You always talking.
Rashad, get your brother.

19:02.019 --> 19:05.138
-He might be right this time.
-Yeah, for real.

19:11.539 --> 19:14.499
Two, three, four. Oh, goddamn.

19:15.219 --> 19:16.499
Hey, girl, hey!

19:16.699 --> 19:18.299
I wonder what her career path is.

19:18.499 --> 19:22.259
Excuse me, gorgeous.
Can I get at you for a second?

19:22.939 --> 19:25.739
I got that. Fine ass.

19:27.899 --> 19:31.020
-So where you going?
-Boy, you know you need to quit.

19:33.180 --> 19:36.059
You see I'm getting hot.
I'm sweating and all that.

19:36.259 --> 19:38.139
I can't take him no more, son.

19:38.339 --> 19:40.139
-That's it. That's it.
-And here he go.

19:40.339 --> 19:41.779
-What happened, man?
-I'm done.

19:41.979 --> 19:42.899
-I'm done.
-Again?

19:46.019 --> 19:48.859
-Wanna try that one more time?
-I got this. I'm good.

19:49.059 --> 19:51.900
Yo, Brooklyn, you're fired, man.
Quit loitering here.

19:52.100 --> 19:54.820
Keep it moving, son. Keep it moving.

19:55.780 --> 19:58.500
All right.
I don't know if you that good, but....

20:01.060 --> 20:03.620
Leave your uniform before
I take it out of your check.

20:03.820 --> 20:06.099
-Hold up, man.
-Get the hell out of here, you idiot.

20:06.299 --> 20:10.820
-''Keep moving, son''?
-I cannot run my pizza place without you?

20:11.020 --> 20:14.380
Man, be that way, then.
That's why you need a timing belt, bitch.

20:14.580 --> 20:16.380
Shut up! Grow some hair on your chest!

20:28.220 --> 20:30.661
You see what I mean?

20:30.901 --> 20:32.541
-Watch out, man.
-See what I'm saying?

20:32.781 --> 20:34.621
I can run my pizza place without you!

20:34.821 --> 20:36.701
Man, pizza was invented in Brooklyn!

20:36.901 --> 20:38.620
And my hat too.

20:40.660 --> 20:43.100
-You gonna break your leg.
-Pizza was made in Brooklyn.

20:43.300 --> 20:45.060
You better cool it, man.
Cool out, man.

20:45.260 --> 20:48.260
-You done lost weight, man. Hell, yeah.
-You idiot.

20:49.741 --> 20:53.941
I need a vacation.

21:07.661 --> 21:09.341
Hey, quit splashing!

21:15.861 --> 21:18.541
-Slow down!
-You gonna hurt yourself.

21:20.861 --> 21:23.861
It's another ATL scorcher.
I heard it's gonna be hot today.

21:24.061 --> 21:26.541
They told me the kids
are heading out to Lake Lanier.

21:26.741 --> 21:29.022
If you're not so lucky
to head out to the lake...

21:29.022 --> 21:30.462
...a pool is the place to be.

21:30.662 --> 21:32.422
Head down to your neighborhood pool...

21:32.622 --> 21:35.422
...because it is the coolest place
you want to be today.

21:35.622 --> 21:38.542
See, that's why I love coming out here.
Look at this here.

21:39.941 --> 21:43.421
Yo, Esquire, man, you are ashy.

21:43.621 --> 21:46.461
For real. It's like somebody
threw baby powder at your knees.

21:46.661 --> 21:48.742
You ashy too, man. What you saying?

21:48.942 --> 21:51.662
I don't know what type of lotion
you gonna use for that arm.

21:51.862 --> 21:55.622
You gonna need some baby oil,
some WD-40 or something.

21:55.822 --> 21:57.662
Some car engine oil
might work for you.

21:58.102 --> 22:01.422
-Trying to talk about somebody.
-Man, hide your wallets.

22:01.622 --> 22:04.182
Here come Ghetto Ghetto
and her two twins.

22:37.903 --> 22:38.983
What y'all doing?

22:39.823 --> 22:41.983
-What it look like?
-Rudeness.

22:42.702 --> 22:44.102
We doing nothing. We chilling.

22:44.302 --> 22:45.943
-What y'all up to?
-Nothing.

22:45.983 --> 22:48.983
-Walking around here looking cute.
-All right.

22:49.223 --> 22:50.183
Y'all sure are.

22:50.423 --> 22:52.263
-And you know something, New New?
-Nope.

22:53.703 --> 22:55.663
No, I'm saying,
when we gonna get together?

22:55.863 --> 22:57.463
Not gonna happen. Never.

22:58.503 --> 23:00.983
Why don't you just let me
finish what I got to say?

23:00.983 --> 23:02.943
I know what you gonna ask me, Teddy.

23:02.943 --> 23:05.984
I know you. And I seen you skate.

23:07.064 --> 23:09.984
-So?
-So that tells me...

23:09.984 --> 23:11.984
...everything I need to know
about a man.

23:13.024 --> 23:16.023
Well, then you should know
I'm the quickest one out there.

23:16.223 --> 23:18.863
I be pumping it out there, baby.
I pop, pop, pop.

23:19.663 --> 23:21.903
Exactly. A quick pumper.

23:24.383 --> 23:27.744
Whatever, man. You want me.
I'm hot. I'm desirable.

23:27.944 --> 23:31.904
I came over here to see was y'all going
to Big Booty Judy's graduation party.

23:31.904 --> 23:33.464
Judy? Party?

23:33.704 --> 23:37.024
Her mama gonna let her have a party
after last year?

23:38.944 --> 23:41.344
Everybody out of here!

23:42.304 --> 23:44.905
I guess. She told us
to come over here and tell folk.

23:45.544 --> 23:46.984
Well, appreciate it, baby.

23:47.464 --> 23:49.584
All right. Bye.

24:04.865 --> 24:07.025
Go ahead.

24:20.224 --> 24:23.385
-What you doing, nigga?
-Hey! Nigga, what it look like?

24:24.185 --> 24:25.785
I'm drying my money.

24:26.185 --> 24:28.705
Yo, why you ain't come to school no more,
man?

24:30.025 --> 24:31.225
Too busy making money.

24:33.665 --> 24:35.945
I can see that.
I saw you with Marcus the other day.

24:36.145 --> 24:38.985
Yeah, he's my cousin.

24:39.865 --> 24:43.146
Hey, we gets paper.

25:00.265 --> 25:03.386
Who's going into Titty City
to get the cash?

25:03.626 --> 25:06.106
Star, I ain't fitting to put my hand
in them skyscrapers.

25:06.346 --> 25:09.266
Look, there's gold in them hills.

25:10.586 --> 25:12.706
What y'all doing?

25:13.186 --> 25:14.266
Nothing.

25:16.386 --> 25:19.345
Y'all think I'm stupid?
I don't wanna have to bust y'all out.

25:20.265 --> 25:22.786
Your bust is already out.

25:24.506 --> 25:27.346
That laugh always got on my nerves.
Shut up, okay?

25:27.546 --> 25:29.826
We was gonna ask,
can we get a ride to Cascade's?

25:30.026 --> 25:31.066
-Ma, please?
-Please?

25:31.306 --> 25:32.626
Do I look like the bus?

25:32.866 --> 25:35.066
Come on. Don't y'all see Mama
trying to take a nap?

25:35.266 --> 25:37.026
Go on. Get me something to drink.

25:37.826 --> 25:40.386
-Hey, Veda, get me something to drink.
-I'm Star.

25:40.586 --> 25:41.547
You know what I mean.

25:47.707 --> 25:49.987
What y'all waiting on?
Y'all know the routine.

25:50.187 --> 25:53.026
Climb your asses out the back.

25:54.066 --> 25:56.346
He's all up in her grill. I ain't lying.

25:56.546 --> 25:58.146
Stay out of her business, okay?

25:58.346 --> 26:01.987
Come on, now. Y'all should be used to this.
Don't be messing up my car.

26:01.987 --> 26:03.387
It's hot as hell up in there.

26:03.587 --> 26:06.147
-I sweated my edges out.
-Damn, me too.

26:06.387 --> 26:09.627
-And when you gonna get that door fixed?
-When you get a job.

26:10.947 --> 26:12.267
What, whoa, wait a minute.

26:12.467 --> 26:16.067
Considering the fact that both of y'all broke,
those better be knockoffs.

26:16.267 --> 26:20.148
If I hear y'all been up to no good at that
mall, it's gonna be on, you understand?

26:20.348 --> 26:21.987
-You understand?
-Yes.

26:22.187 --> 26:24.067
Your asses ain't too old to be beat.

26:39.467 --> 26:40.948
-Hey, Big Ronnie.
-What's happening?

26:41.188 --> 26:43.428
Nothing to it.
Something wrong with these wheels.

26:43.668 --> 26:44.988
Come here. Let me take a look.

26:45.868 --> 26:47.988
-Watch the counter.
-All right.

26:49.908 --> 26:51.868
-Hey.
-Hey.

26:51.868 --> 26:53.587
-What you need?
-Size seven.

26:53.787 --> 26:55.667
Where's your ticket?

26:57.507 --> 26:59.388
I think I lost it.

27:00.028 --> 27:01.508
-Hey, Big Ron?
-Yeah.

27:01.708 --> 27:03.988
What we got to say about folks
who lost their ticket?

27:04.188 --> 27:05.508
No tickets, no skates.

27:05.708 --> 27:09.748
Sorry, hon. No ticket, no skates.

27:09.948 --> 27:13.348
Big Ronnie, please report to the men's room
with the mop and bucket.

27:13.868 --> 27:15.668
Overflow, brother.

27:17.388 --> 27:20.589
Hey, give me some.

27:23.109 --> 27:25.908
-What?
-I said, give me some.

27:26.628 --> 27:30.988
I don't know where your mouth been.
You might have the cooties.

27:30.988 --> 27:32.908
I might.

27:43.309 --> 27:45.389
So you know your boy Esquire suck.

27:45.669 --> 27:50.589
-You'd be better off with me on your line.
-No.

27:51.349 --> 27:55.109
Why? Give me one good reason.

27:55.309 --> 27:56.868
I'll give you two.

27:57.348 --> 27:59.389
You ain't cute.

28:02.869 --> 28:05.149
And you drank all my soda!

28:05.749 --> 28:07.629
A friendly reminder,
ladies and gentlemen.

28:07.829 --> 28:09.389
Skate Wars in five weeks, y'all.

28:09.589 --> 28:13.189
Bragging rights for the year.
It's all on the line.

28:15.589 --> 28:18.190
Why you don't cut across the middle
and get your speed up?

28:18.430 --> 28:21.790
Why don't you go roll your neck at
somebody else and let me handle mine?

28:21.870 --> 28:23.430
I'm trying to help you out.

28:23.630 --> 28:26.830
Your takeoff is weak and
you starting to make Rashad look bad.

28:27.549 --> 28:31.589
I don't like you. Really don't.

28:32.989 --> 28:35.029
Man, I hope you catch up.

28:37.110 --> 28:38.230
Stupid.

28:51.910 --> 28:54.790
Nobody move....

29:09.870 --> 29:10.950
Go ladies! Go ladies!

29:42.751 --> 29:44.951
Hey, listen, shorty,
I want you to walk up to him.

29:44.951 --> 29:47.231
-Yeah.
-I'll introduce you to him. Be cool.

29:47.431 --> 29:48.991
If he asks you a question, answer.

29:49.191 --> 29:51.231
-Don't say nothing unnecessary.
-All right.

29:51.471 --> 29:55.032
I was so weak, my leg--
I woke up, one of my footies was off.

29:55.992 --> 29:58.832
Cold flashes.
Look, she wasn't nowhere around.

29:58.872 --> 30:00.992
I was like, ''Man, where she go at?''

30:01.911 --> 30:03.871
This is my nigga, Ant.

30:04.951 --> 30:07.311
-What's up?
-Germs.

30:07.911 --> 30:11.151
Cleanliness is next to godliness,
you know.

30:11.351 --> 30:12.631
-All right.
-Back up.

30:12.831 --> 30:16.392
Anyway, like I said, I went downstairs,
I'm looking, she's nowhere to be found.

30:16.592 --> 30:20.192
So my front door's locked.
So I'm like, ''Did she take my house keys?''

30:20.392 --> 30:21.872
She must have went
out the window.

30:46.872 --> 30:48.992
Oh, sh--

30:59.433 --> 31:03.473
Oh, damn. Down goes Frazier.
Down goes Frazier.

31:03.673 --> 31:05.072
Somebody call the ambulance.

31:05.792 --> 31:07.952
There was one deadly sin at the rink.

31:08.712 --> 31:10.152
y ou don't fall.

31:10.392 --> 31:12.392
-Take them down.
-y ou just don't do it.

31:12.633 --> 31:15.233
y ou may lose your footing,
slip a little bit...

31:15.433 --> 31:17.153
...stumble at the most.

31:17.353 --> 31:19.953
But you don't fall.

31:20.553 --> 31:22.833
This is humiliating.

31:23.113 --> 31:27.513
Shorties ain't checking
for a player with a limp and a cast.

31:27.953 --> 31:30.073
How's that gonna work out for me?

32:02.034 --> 32:03.794
Man, they working me hard out there.

32:03.994 --> 32:05.714
-Running you, huh?
-Yeah, who next?

32:05.914 --> 32:08.513
This is for John Garnett in the rotunda.

32:10.033 --> 32:12.754
-Did you say John Garnett?
-Yeah.

32:12.994 --> 32:15.714
-The John Garnett?
-Sure.

32:15.954 --> 32:18.274
Man, you ain't understanding
what I'm talking about.

32:18.474 --> 32:20.634
Let me show you, man. Look at this.

32:20.834 --> 32:22.994
Had it a long time.

32:24.994 --> 32:26.274
United Express.

32:26.874 --> 32:27.954
That's his.

32:30.475 --> 32:33.635
-How my breath?
-Crystal clear.

32:46.394 --> 32:49.114
I'll have one of these, please.

32:49.354 --> 32:51.035
Yes, sir.

32:55.315 --> 32:58.035
-Here's your drink, sir.
-Thank you.

32:58.235 --> 32:59.915
Good choice. You celebrating?

33:01.635 --> 33:02.915
What makes you think that?

33:02.915 --> 33:05.035
Well, since you took over United Express...

33:05.235 --> 33:07.955
...the company has six consecutive quarters
in the black.

33:08.835 --> 33:11.515
I'd say you have a lot to celebrate, sir.

33:12.195 --> 33:14.155
-Good point.
-Ben Gordon.

33:14.915 --> 33:17.395
-John Gar--
-Garnett. I know.

33:19.235 --> 33:21.875
Well, you gentlemen
enjoy the rest of the evening.

33:29.156 --> 33:31.996
To six consecutive quarters in the black.

33:38.036 --> 33:39.836
Y'all ready to work?

33:41.835 --> 33:44.675
Don't be looking at him.
You out of uniform, man.

33:44.875 --> 33:46.955
Pull that thing up,
button up your top collar.

33:47.155 --> 33:49.676
I told you to be professional.

33:50.836 --> 33:52.116
Boy.

33:54.676 --> 33:57.036
Which one of y'all pooted, man?

35:10.358 --> 35:12.918
Hey, DJ Drama, pay attention.
Let's go, hey!

35:16.357 --> 35:17.997
This party is kind of cute, though.

35:18.677 --> 35:20.677
But where the food at?
Because I'm hungry.

35:20.877 --> 35:22.197
No, don't eat anything in here.

35:22.397 --> 35:24.917
-That's right, I did see roaches.
-A lot of roaches.

35:27.998 --> 35:30.318
-What's wrong with you?
-Nothing. I'm good.

35:30.518 --> 35:31.958
Y'all seen Rashad and them?

35:31.958 --> 35:34.998
See, that's what it is.
You are so sprung, New New.

35:35.238 --> 35:36.718
-No, I--
-Yes, you are.

35:36.918 --> 35:39.598
-You open like a can of pig feet, girl.
-Exactly.

35:46.718 --> 35:48.958
-Hey.
-Hi.

35:51.758 --> 35:53.038
Come on.

36:15.759 --> 36:17.199
What you smiling so much for?

36:20.038 --> 36:21.878
What took you so long, anyway?

36:22.878 --> 36:25.799
Oh, you were looking for me.

36:26.439 --> 36:29.479
No, I was just-- No.

36:29.679 --> 36:30.959
It's all right.

36:30.959 --> 36:34.919
You know, Rashad tends
to have that effect on women.

36:37.199 --> 36:40.359
-Who you come with?
-Crew.

36:40.599 --> 36:43.039
-Where they at?
-They around.

37:21.039 --> 37:21.999
This you?

37:22.119 --> 37:24.520
I know this ain't the bitch
got you tripping on me.

37:24.720 --> 37:26.280
-Hold up.
-Who you calling a bitch?

37:26.480 --> 37:28.880
Bitch, I'm calling you a bitch.
Quit eyeballing me.

37:28.880 --> 37:30.920
Please don't get hurt, you dirty trick.

37:30.920 --> 37:32.840
-Who you calling trick?
-You, trick!

37:33.040 --> 37:34.560
-Are you crazy?
-Don't get hurt.

37:34.760 --> 37:37.040
-I got your trick.
-Hey, man, watch out.

37:37.040 --> 37:39.000
-Calm down.
-Please get this groupie.

37:39.360 --> 37:40.560
Hey, what are you, slow?

37:41.440 --> 37:43.401
We done already went through this.

37:43.601 --> 37:44.921
Man, we done.

37:45.121 --> 37:46.761
It's over.

37:46.881 --> 37:49.881
No, I'm not even gonna believe that.

37:51.520 --> 37:52.920
All right.

37:53.520 --> 37:54.800
Believe this.

37:55.000 --> 37:57.560
-Thirsty trick.
-Watch your mouth.

38:04.161 --> 38:06.201
-What's up?
-What's going on?

38:07.921 --> 38:09.881
-Yes, ma'am.
-Don't you be ''yes, ma'am ''-ing me.

38:10.081 --> 38:11.361
No.

38:11.561 --> 38:14.041
I'm sorry about that. For real.

38:14.041 --> 38:17.161
You need to control
your little groupies next time.

38:18.601 --> 38:20.721
What's wrong with y'all?

38:21.282 --> 38:23.961
Mom found some of that
Gucci stuff in the washer.

38:24.641 --> 38:26.321
Are you serious?

38:26.521 --> 38:28.881
-Told your ass to dry-clean it.
-Do you understand?

38:29.081 --> 38:30.961
-Do you understand?
-Yes, ma'am.

38:30.961 --> 38:33.761
Anyway, she coming to get us right now.

38:33.961 --> 38:36.121
If you want a ride,
you better stay here with us.

38:37.361 --> 38:38.881
But we just got here.

38:39.081 --> 38:40.361
I'll take her.

38:40.561 --> 38:43.962
Hey, twins, get your
little thieving asses down here!

38:43.962 --> 38:45.322
Hurry up!

38:45.522 --> 38:46.962

Y'all's asses gonna go to jail, stealing!

38:51.722 --> 38:55.841
Some dyke's gonna get ahold
of your asses!

38:56.361 --> 38:59.361
And all that crying
don't mean a damn thing to me!

38:59.601 --> 39:02.042
Your asses wasn't crying
when you were stealing.

39:02.042 --> 39:04.882
Now you wanna cry.
Hurry up and get your asses in the trunk!

39:05.082 --> 39:07.002
Kick your asses tonight.

39:14.042 --> 39:15.602
New New.

39:17.802 --> 39:19.723
What's so funny?

39:19.923 --> 39:21.963
What kind of name is New New, anyway?

39:22.323 --> 39:23.923
I'm New New...

39:23.923 --> 39:28.842
...because I always
rock the new, new shit.

39:28.882 --> 39:31.562
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

39:31.802 --> 39:36.402
Heard you and your homegirls
don't buy none of that new, new shit.

39:37.042 --> 39:39.002
Whatever.

39:41.043 --> 39:44.003
Your parents ain't gonna be hot
about you coming home so late?

39:44.003 --> 39:46.043
Boy, I am grown.

39:46.043 --> 39:49.003
Your parents gonna be mad
that you out this late?

39:50.603 --> 39:51.883
No.

39:53.603 --> 39:56.682
Your parents don't care
about their little baby, Rashad?

39:58.883 --> 40:01.483
My parents passed away...

40:01.723 --> 40:03.683
...a few years back.

40:04.523 --> 40:06.283
Car accident.

40:09.643 --> 40:13.243
-I'm so sorry, Rashad.
-It's cool.

40:17.563 --> 40:19.644
I think love is in the air.

40:19.844 --> 40:22.044
Let me go to my request lines,
see if anybody's on.

40:22.244 --> 40:23.964
-What's happening?
-Pull over there.

40:23.964 --> 40:27.684
-How's everybody doing out there?
-Go ahead and give your shout out.

40:27.884 --> 40:29.923
I just wanna send
a shout out to my boo...

40:29.923 --> 40:33.083
...who's incarcerated, but I want him
to get some love right now.

40:33.323 --> 40:35.483
-What we stop here for?
-I'll tell you what.

40:35.723 --> 40:37.684
This one is going out to you, baby.

40:37.924 --> 40:40.964
My bus come in like an hour, so....

40:41.004 --> 40:42.684
Your bus?

40:43.044 --> 40:45.724
Think I'm gonna stalk you
if I find out where you stay?

40:46.804 --> 40:47.924
Maybe.

40:50.364 --> 40:52.804
I mean, but-- Like, for real, though...

40:53.004 --> 40:55.484
...you ain't gotta hide nothing from me.

40:55.684 --> 40:58.445
Ain't like I'm Donald Trump or somebody.

41:02.444 --> 41:03.964
This is my song.

41:05.324 --> 41:08.564
Don't play with me right now.
This is my jam.

41:08.804 --> 41:12.804
What? Oh, yes, hey.

41:13.164 --> 41:14.724
You like this song?

41:14.964 --> 41:17.405
All right, go, girl, sing it. What?

41:18.525 --> 41:20.525
How about we listen to it
and let them sing?

41:24.165 --> 41:26.525
See, all that is unnecessary.

41:26.725 --> 41:28.125
I'm just kidding, shorty.

41:30.045 --> 41:33.724
-So how do I skate?
-What you mean?

41:33.884 --> 41:38.085
You said you could tell a lot about a man
by the way he skate.

41:38.365 --> 41:39.965
So how do I skate?

41:43.325 --> 41:45.765
-I don't know.
-Just be real.

41:47.565 --> 41:50.445
You.... You all right.

41:50.925 --> 41:53.365
You got a little style to you.

41:53.885 --> 41:56.446
You real confident, you know.

41:57.966 --> 42:01.726
I can't believe I'm even talking to you
and telling you this right now.

42:07.005 --> 42:08.885
You special.

42:08.885 --> 42:10.205
Special, huh?

42:11.005 --> 42:13.165
I don't know about that.

42:14.605 --> 42:16.926
I wish you could see what I see.

42:41.406 --> 42:44.446
You ain't never had real barbecue
till you've had JJ's Rib Shack.

42:44.646 --> 42:46.006
I don't know how you living.

42:46.046 --> 42:49.046
How you living? You ain't had
nothing till Abdullah's Rib Shop.

42:49.286 --> 42:52.726
I know he's a pro wrestler and everything,
but he can make some sauce.

42:56.407 --> 42:58.007
Check that out, man.

42:58.207 --> 42:59.927
Get the door.

43:05.246 --> 43:07.046
Ain't you supposed to be in class, boy?

43:07.806 --> 43:09.766
Man, bell's about to ring right now.

43:16.167 --> 43:18.367
Man, what you rolling on, 24's?

43:18.847 --> 43:21.447
No, see, that why you
need to be in class, boy. Them 28's.

43:21.687 --> 43:24.647
-Where your ruler at?
-Man, I need to get myself one of these.

43:24.967 --> 43:28.047
You do.
Come on, take a ride with your boy.

43:28.327 --> 43:31.767
-For real?
-No, boy, for play-play. Come on.

43:40.447 --> 43:41.727
Get some of this tuna, man.

43:41.927 --> 43:44.247
-No carbs, bro.
-Cheesesteak.

43:50.727 --> 43:52.888
-You scared of dogs?
-No.

43:53.128 --> 43:54.368
Watch out now, boy!

43:56.488 --> 43:58.448
What's up, boy?

43:58.648 --> 44:01.008
You sure you ain't scared of dogs?

44:01.728 --> 44:03.328
-No.
-Good, then.

44:03.928 --> 44:07.367
It's feeding time. Come on.

44:07.567 --> 44:09.007
Back up.

44:11.687 --> 44:12.768
You go first.

44:14.648 --> 44:17.888
Get back in there.
What's up?

44:17.888 --> 44:22.048
Young buck, so what's shaking?
You got a broad?

44:22.648 --> 44:23.728
No.

44:26.488 --> 44:28.208
Jumping and stuff.

44:28.448 --> 44:30.608
Hit that bowl right there.
Come here, baby.

44:32.729 --> 44:34.489
Scare, come here.

44:34.689 --> 44:35.969
Oh, man, look at that.

44:36.409 --> 44:38.728
You put more food
on the ground than in the bowl.

44:38.928 --> 44:40.128
You costing me money already.

44:41.248 --> 44:43.368
How about kids?

44:43.568 --> 44:44.848
Not that I know of.

44:45.528 --> 44:47.168
You doing something?

44:49.008 --> 44:51.889
-You know, a little something.
-Boy, you ain't doing nothing, boy.

44:53.049 --> 44:55.689
You smoke? You smoke? You smoking?

44:56.169 --> 44:58.729
I don't, but, you know, to each his own.

44:59.209 --> 45:02.249
That's cool, boy. Say no to drugs.
Dare to be different.

45:04.169 --> 45:07.329
So, what was your last
place of employment, young buck?

45:07.529 --> 45:09.889
-Cleaning.
-Cleaning?

45:11.049 --> 45:14.809
Look to me like the Swann Cleaning Service
about to lose an employee.

45:15.889 --> 45:17.609
You wanna work, right?

45:18.409 --> 45:20.929
But you know
this is grown-man business, don't you?

45:21.129 --> 45:24.849
-I know.
-You sure?

45:26.049 --> 45:27.809
Okay.

45:28.489 --> 45:29.929
We gonna see.

45:35.170 --> 45:37.130
-Hey.
-Yo.

45:37.330 --> 45:39.010
Where you been?

45:40.290 --> 45:41.889
Out.

45:42.809 --> 45:45.889
Out? Come here.

45:49.930 --> 45:52.050
I know you ain't been out there
being stupid.

45:52.050 --> 45:54.170
-I'm telling you, Ant, I ain't playing.
-What?

45:56.050 --> 45:59.170
''What?'' Don't ''what'' me, man.

45:59.370 --> 46:02.050
What's up with you missing history class?
That's what.

46:02.410 --> 46:06.210
Man, you probably caught me
on bathroom break or something.

46:06.850 --> 46:08.610
I look stupid?

46:10.051 --> 46:11.091
Man, I'm saying, though...

46:11.331 --> 46:13.410
...I don't see
how the Great Wall of China...

46:13.650 --> 46:15.970
...helps me clean the floor
at Value Village.

46:40.931 --> 46:41.971
Man, what, you hustling?

46:44.810 --> 46:46.930
You should know better than that.

46:49.451 --> 46:51.571
You ain't gotta be
a dope boy to have money.

46:53.731 --> 46:55.931
This what cleaning the floors gets you.

46:57.931 --> 47:00.331
I been saving this for three years now.

47:00.531 --> 47:02.011
Ever since the accident.

47:02.531 --> 47:04.971
-Been saving for what?
-For you.

47:05.811 --> 47:07.652
So you can get out of here.

47:08.132 --> 47:10.932
Do something with yourself.
Go to school.

47:11.852 --> 47:13.652
Get away from dumb-ass Uncle George.

47:14.852 --> 47:18.171
Man, you should spend that
on some rims...

47:18.371 --> 47:20.291
...or skates or something.

47:20.491 --> 47:22.451
Don't be wasting that on me.

47:22.651 --> 47:25.691
I guess just because your head big,
that don't make you smart.

47:28.372 --> 47:33.892
Hey, I believe in you, even when you
too stupid to believe in your damn self.

47:56.692 --> 47:58.812
-What's the deal?
-What's up, man?

47:59.012 --> 48:01.532
-Man, I hear you holding now.
-Man, who told you that?

48:02.732 --> 48:04.932
Why you tripping?
I known you since third grade.

48:05.132 --> 48:07.573
Yeah, but you been out of school
for four weeks.

48:08.253 --> 48:11.413
Man, I had mono.
Come on, man, you holding or what?

48:17.253 --> 48:20.812
-No.
-All right, that's what's up.

48:23.572 --> 48:24.932
Narc.

48:26.933 --> 48:28.413
Hey, Ben.

48:28.613 --> 48:30.253
Oh, hey, Mr. Garnett.

48:30.453 --> 48:31.733
Nice to see you again.

48:32.373 --> 48:36.973
My buddies and I, we lost our fourth.
Afraid of a little weather.

48:37.853 --> 48:39.693
You play?

48:51.733 --> 48:53.253
That's my partner.

48:58.893 --> 49:01.293
Oh, damn.

49:10.974 --> 49:12.374
Yeah!

49:15.054 --> 49:16.854
So your family's from the city, Ben?

49:17.054 --> 49:18.894
You're not
a Mechanicsville hood product.

49:18.894 --> 49:22.413
No, not me, sir.
You wouldn't catch me in a place like that.

49:22.893 --> 49:25.694
That shot on 1 7 was about 200 yards.

49:25.934 --> 49:28.294
Hell of a game, man.
We whipped their asses.

49:28.534 --> 49:30.414
Yes, we did.

49:30.614 --> 49:32.614
Oh, man.

49:32.974 --> 49:34.414
Oh, no, no, sir.

49:34.654 --> 49:37.494
-It was my pleasure.
-Oh, no, don't be silly. You earned it.

49:37.694 --> 49:41.054
And if there's anything I can ever
do for you, you let me know.

49:41.414 --> 49:44.375
Well, actually, there is something
you could help me out with.

49:44.615 --> 49:45.895
Talk to me.

49:45.895 --> 49:47.895
I could use a letter of recommendation.

49:55.174 --> 49:57.134
And she had the nerve to step to me.

49:57.334 --> 49:59.614
-She know she lucky too.
-Forget her.

49:59.854 --> 50:03.775
The question is, what happened
when Rashad gave you a ride, nasty?

50:04.015 --> 50:05.935
-''I'll take her.''
-Nothing happened.

50:06.175 --> 50:09.695
-You lying.
-It's all in your grill.

50:09.935 --> 50:11.335
That's him right there. Come on.

50:11.535 --> 50:14.575
Men, grab your ladies.
Ladies, grab your weaves.

50:14.775 --> 50:17.895
It's about to be on.
Y'all got three minutes till couples' skate...

50:18.095 --> 50:19.935
...and four weeks till Skate Wars.

50:19.935 --> 50:23.016
But until then, hold this.

51:17.456 --> 51:19.656
Man, I got that good...

51:19.856 --> 51:21.257
...the bad...

51:21.457 --> 51:23.257
...and, man, the ugly herbal.

51:26.776 --> 51:28.536
-I gotta smoke something.
-Hey.

51:28.736 --> 51:31.096
Man, I don't understand
a word that you been saying.

51:31.296 --> 51:32.656
What you want, man?

51:34.976 --> 51:36.976
Well, well, well.
So we meet again.

51:37.616 --> 51:39.056
What's up, gorgeous?

51:39.576 --> 51:41.897
You tell me.
You're the one that's shining.

51:41.937 --> 51:45.457
Oh, you know, that's how we do.
But you look mighty fine yourself.

51:45.697 --> 51:47.657
Oh, thank you.

51:50.297 --> 51:53.977
So do you wanna hook up or what?

51:57.217 --> 51:59.777
Yeah, you know, like...

51:59.977 --> 52:01.897
...if it set up all right.

52:01.897 --> 52:03.937
You know, I be real--

52:04.177 --> 52:07.257
-Stepped on that shit.
-Yeah, boy.

52:07.457 --> 52:10.497
This thing's off the chain, tonight, man.

52:10.897 --> 52:12.937
I got shotgun.

52:13.937 --> 52:15.897
Hey, whoa, whoa.

52:15.937 --> 52:17.577
-What are you doing?
-Come on.

52:17.817 --> 52:19.017
Come on, Brooklyn.

52:19.217 --> 52:21.098
-You heard me call shotgun.
-Come on, man.

52:21.338 --> 52:24.018
All right, you see up in here, right?
You see it, right?

52:24.258 --> 52:26.778
It's like a goddamn
Negro clown car up in here, man.

52:27.018 --> 52:29.497
Come on, get your ass in the back, man.
That's real.

52:30.777 --> 52:33.137
-Damn.
-Come on, I don't like him, man.

52:33.337 --> 52:35.937
He never sits in the front.
Now he wanna sit in the front.

52:36.137 --> 52:38.057
-Sit your ass over.
-Shut up.

52:40.098 --> 52:41.578
Hey, man, what you doing?

52:41.898 --> 52:45.658
-Ain't you gonna wait on Ant?
-He say he got a ride.

52:51.938 --> 52:53.978
That tickles.

52:55.058 --> 52:58.299
That's my belly button, baby.

52:58.499 --> 53:00.738
Yeah, yeah. I know.

53:01.138 --> 53:02.618
Good, baby.

53:02.818 --> 53:05.018
You're getting closer.

53:05.858 --> 53:07.938
-That's strong, baby.
-What's up? What's up?

53:10.978 --> 53:12.898
-Was it a good idea to keep my money?
-No, no!

53:14.018 --> 53:17.018
Shut up. Come on. Get up.

53:20.899 --> 53:21.979
Come on. Come on.

53:22.499 --> 53:25.819
Boy,
don't you know I graduated with a 3.68?

53:26.019 --> 53:29.059
Lord, I'm parched.
Let me get my drink.

53:30.579 --> 53:33.418
This supposed to be my family,
my blood cousin.

53:33.618 --> 53:36.058
-Give me the money. Give me the money.
-All right.

53:36.258 --> 53:39.899
-It was only 100 dollars.
-That's it?

53:41.979 --> 53:43.619
Shut up.

53:44.779 --> 53:46.499
Shut up.

53:46.939 --> 53:49.419
You better not tell my mama.

53:53.019 --> 53:54.899
Come on, baby.

54:01.048 --> 54:05.012
That empty space right there on the bar,
that's for this year's trophy.

54:05.212 --> 54:07.212
Don't even worry about that.

54:07.413 --> 54:08.653
A little confident, aren't we?

54:08.854 --> 54:11.574
For good reason. You like the pole?

54:12.615 --> 54:14.457
You wish.

54:16.258 --> 54:17.540
What's this?

54:18.020 --> 54:19.301
Nothing.

54:25.344 --> 54:28.065
These are fly. You did these?

54:28.907 --> 54:33.190
Yeah, but it was just
me fooling around, though.

54:33.789 --> 54:36.752
This ain't somebody just fooling around.

54:37.472 --> 54:39.673
This is good, Rashad.

54:49.560 --> 54:51.321
Is this me?

54:53.482 --> 54:56.845
-My mouth is not that big.
-Hey.

54:57.046 --> 54:59.487
It's artistic expression.

54:59.487 --> 55:04.168
And I'm sensitive about my shit,
so I'd appreciate it....

55:05.129 --> 55:06.691
Thank you.

55:06.891 --> 55:08.372
Cute.

55:08.652 --> 55:09.933
But for real, Rashad...

55:10.654 --> 55:11.934
...you got talent.

55:13.094 --> 55:15.217
-I don't know.
-Like you can't have no talent.

55:15.417 --> 55:18.178
Be real with me. Come on.

55:18.379 --> 55:21.100
Be real with me. I'm serious.

55:21.661 --> 55:23.341
All right.

55:23.662 --> 55:27.183
Well, when I was younger,
every Sunday...

55:27.424 --> 55:29.786
...my pops used to give me...

55:30.387 --> 55:32.148
...the comics out the of Sunday paper.

55:33.668 --> 55:37.672
I guess I kind of had this dream...

55:38.632 --> 55:40.313
...that one day I could be the one...

55:40.513 --> 55:43.554
...who drew the comics
in the Sunday paper.

55:44.676 --> 55:47.957
-That's it.
-You still can.

56:00.725 --> 56:02.527
What's happening, Uncle G?

56:03.648 --> 56:05.609
How you doing this morning?

56:12.414 --> 56:14.934
Get myself some orange juice.
Good morning, brother.

56:15.134 --> 56:17.296
-Good morning, Uncle George.
-What's happening?

56:18.418 --> 56:21.699
What is y'all so happy about?

56:22.620 --> 56:24.901
How come you here grinning?
You just grinning.

56:25.101 --> 56:27.223
Grinning, like you
a new man or something.

56:27.624 --> 56:31.226
No, Rashad's a New New man.
He got some cutty last night.

56:31.666 --> 56:33.026
Shut up.

56:34.347 --> 56:35.789
You got some booty
in this house?

56:36.789 --> 56:38.910
I told you I don't want
no company in my house.

56:39.151 --> 56:41.713
I told you I don't want
them fast girls in my house.

56:41.753 --> 56:44.034
No females in this house, that's the rule.

56:44.594 --> 56:46.315
There's a one-bowl rule in effect.

56:47.996 --> 56:49.997
Okay, Uncle George.

56:53.039 --> 56:54.961
One bowl.

56:58.363 --> 56:59.885
What is with you?

57:00.965 --> 57:02.926
I ain't gonna lie.

57:03.127 --> 57:05.889
-I got some cutty last night.
-Stop lying.

57:06.129 --> 57:07.929
You ain't got no cutty.

57:08.489 --> 57:10.371
With your little scrawny ass.

57:10.571 --> 57:12.812
If anybody gets some cutty,
it's supposed to be me.

57:13.012 --> 57:14.894
I gets the booty here.
I gets the drawers.

57:15.095 --> 57:17.015
I gets the booty. I gets the trim.

57:17.215 --> 57:19.817
I'm the one supposed to be getting cutty.
I'm a grown man.

57:20.018 --> 57:22.699
I get the cutty, not y'all.
Understand what I'm saying?

57:22.699 --> 57:24.541
Uncle George. Me.

57:24.740 --> 57:27.942
Well, I guess we see
who didn't get the cutty last night, huh?

57:28.503 --> 57:30.545
Give me my cereal.

57:30.744 --> 57:32.665
I hope your little weenie fall off.

57:34.587 --> 57:35.667
You say something?

57:35.868 --> 57:38.429
-No, man, let me see this.
-See what?

57:38.629 --> 57:40.630
This thing gonna make
her neck turn green.

57:40.630 --> 57:43.192
Man, shut up, man.
It got the 1 4-karat stamp on it.

57:43.393 --> 57:46.674
I don't know how you bought that.
You never bought a girl anything.

57:46.674 --> 57:49.117
-So what, man?
-You need to watch it, Rashad.

57:49.317 --> 57:50.957
This girl got your nose wide open.

57:51.158 --> 57:52.558
Let you tell it.

57:52.759 --> 57:56.040
Yeah, it ain't even like that.
She real, man.

57:56.240 --> 57:58.282
He bought a cheap-ass necklace
for New New.

57:59.683 --> 58:01.603
l was about to buy her some shit, man.

58:01.603 --> 58:03.165
-Yeah, right.
-We gotta go, man.

58:03.365 --> 58:04.646
It's my first day, B.

58:04.846 --> 58:06.647
K.K. Soul Food.

58:06.847 --> 58:08.730
I'm with my people now, homey.

58:08.730 --> 58:10.530
Free collards. Free collard greens.

58:10.730 --> 58:11.931
Why you blocking, man?

58:12.171 --> 58:13.573
That's what I'm talking about.

58:14.533 --> 58:15.494
Who this?

58:16.854 --> 58:18.574
-New New.
-Shut up, man.

58:18.655 --> 58:21.377
-What you want?
-I need a ride tomorrow.

58:21.577 --> 58:22.698
I got you.

58:22.979 --> 58:25.580
You got some gas money?
Hold on.

58:27.861 --> 58:30.743
-Who this?
-It's New New.

58:32.386 --> 58:35.306
Y'all need to find something to do,
because y'all ain't funny.

58:36.106 --> 58:38.588
-I love that.
-Hold on.

58:39.869 --> 58:41.510
-Yo.
-Who's that?

58:41.710 --> 58:45.312
-Teddy.
-Hey, how old is he anyway, 30?

58:45.552 --> 58:48.835
Hold on. Hello?

58:50.156 --> 58:51.797
Hello?

58:51.837 --> 58:53.117
Hello?

58:54.598 --> 58:55.719
My bad, man.

58:55.919 --> 58:57.721
I just wanted to see what was popping.

58:58.040 --> 58:59.962
Hey, y'all going to the pool tomorrow?

59:00.163 --> 59:02.805
I don't know.
I gotta take Esquire up to Sandy Springs.

59:02.805 --> 59:03.804
Teddy? Teddy.

59:04.324 --> 59:08.769
If you don't get off that damn phone
and clean them dishes....

59:09.289 --> 59:11.889
Hey, Ma, I'm 21 years old, man.

59:12.090 --> 59:13.611
Still getting on the phone?

59:21.776 --> 59:24.459
I never feel comfortable
on this side of town.

59:24.739 --> 59:27.621
Man, kind of how I feel
about our neighborhood.

59:27.821 --> 59:30.781
I don't see what this cat making you
drive all the way up here for.

59:30.982 --> 59:32.782
He invited me to dinner, fool.

59:33.264 --> 59:34.944
Man, this is John Garnett.

59:35.145 --> 59:38.187
The millionaire.
If he want me to cook dinner, I'm with it.

59:39.228 --> 59:42.591
-Hey, man, that's 31 Canterbury.
-Right here?

59:45.591 --> 59:47.032
Damn!

59:47.752 --> 59:49.073
Yeah.

59:49.313 --> 59:51.555
Hey, man, go ahead and push the buzzer.

59:55.358 --> 59:56.599
y es, may I help you?

59:59.761 --> 01:00:03.364
It's Benjamin-- It's Benjamin Gordon
for John Garnett.

01:00:03.603 --> 01:00:06.364
y es, Benjamin. John's expecting you.
Come on in.

01:00:20.255 --> 01:00:22.615
Ben. Right on time.

01:00:22.815 --> 01:00:24.377
-Always, sir.
-Come on in.

01:00:36.385 --> 01:00:39.466
I talked to some friends
at the Falcon Society.

01:00:41.827 --> 01:00:43.629
This should help.

01:00:45.991 --> 01:00:47.792
Thank you.

01:00:48.352 --> 01:00:50.875
One thing you should learn
early in this life:

01:00:51.074 --> 01:00:53.635
It's not always what you know.

01:00:53.836 --> 01:00:56.158
Sometimes it's who you know.

01:00:56.717 --> 01:00:58.279
Yes, sir.

01:00:58.478 --> 01:00:59.880
You'll be fine.

01:00:59.920 --> 01:01:01.841
-You hungry?
-Oh, I could eat.

01:01:01.881 --> 01:01:04.002
Well, dinner's almost ready.

01:01:09.687 --> 01:01:13.009
I'd like you to meet my daughter.
She's going to Brinton next year too.

01:01:13.209 --> 01:01:16.250
Erin, honey?
Come down to dinner.

01:01:16.851 --> 01:01:20.332
-You hear me?
-Yes. I'm coming.

01:01:20.533 --> 01:01:22.375
Have sons.

01:01:23.256 --> 01:01:26.537
I just wanna say again,
I appreciate this a lot.

01:01:26.737 --> 01:01:28.219
Oh, well, just do well.

01:01:28.419 --> 01:01:30.140
You'll be fine.

01:01:30.340 --> 01:01:32.621
-Here she is.
-That shirt is just so cute.

01:01:32.861 --> 01:01:34.782
-Dad, I already ate.
-That's all right.

01:01:35.022 --> 01:01:36.903
Come here.

01:01:37.665 --> 01:01:40.666
Erin, I'd like you to meet Ben.

01:01:44.869 --> 01:01:48.232
-This is her friend Holly. She lives next door.
-Hi.

01:01:48.431 --> 01:01:50.793
I gotta go. Bye.

01:01:50.993 --> 01:01:52.474
Bye.

01:01:53.514 --> 01:01:54.795
Strange chick.

01:01:54.995 --> 01:01:57.798
Erin, nice to meet you.

01:01:57.997 --> 01:02:01.560
It's always a pleasure
meeting new people.

01:02:02.680 --> 01:02:04.242
It's nice to meet you too.

01:02:20.653 --> 01:02:22.895
You're not telling Rashad.

01:02:24.055 --> 01:02:25.935
Wow, you even talk different.

01:02:26.295 --> 01:02:27.736
You're not telling him.

01:02:27.937 --> 01:02:30.659
Oh, I'm telling him. Please believe that.

01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:32.940
You're not saying anything to him...

01:02:32.940 --> 01:02:35.142
...and I'm not telling my dad about you.

01:02:35.502 --> 01:02:37.663
If I tell him where you're from,
you're done.

01:02:37.863 --> 01:02:40.825
-Is that a threat?
-Call it what you want.

01:02:41.186 --> 01:02:43.266
I gotta tell him in my own way.

01:02:45.388 --> 01:02:50.231
I knew it. Because Rashad was
telling me how ''New New is this'' ...

01:02:50.430 --> 01:02:52.233
...and ''New New's so real.''

01:02:52.432 --> 01:02:54.394
-I am real.
-You ain't shit.

01:02:54.594 --> 01:02:56.595
Excuse you?

01:02:57.516 --> 01:02:59.518
How did you even find Cascade?

01:02:59.718 --> 01:03:03.560
What, you go buy you a 99-cent ghetto
handbook to show you how to keep it real?

01:03:11.285 --> 01:03:13.327
The salad fork goes on the other side.

01:03:14.927 --> 01:03:16.369
I'm from the Trey.

01:03:18.570 --> 01:03:20.850
You from the Trey? That's funny.

01:03:21.051 --> 01:03:24.413
-Well, my dad is.
-I never read that.

01:03:24.613 --> 01:03:27.095
-He never talks about it.
-I don't blame him.

01:03:27.896 --> 01:03:30.097
Are you serious?

01:03:30.417 --> 01:03:31.819
He's a sellout.

01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:36.060
You really wanna be ghetto.

01:03:37.342 --> 01:03:40.704
Believe me, you can have
the piss in the hallway.

01:03:40.944 --> 01:03:43.305
I'll take the Picasso.

01:03:44.347 --> 01:03:45.827
You got a Picasso in your house!

01:03:46.468 --> 01:03:48.629
You need to lower your voice. Shut up.

01:03:48.869 --> 01:03:51.873
I bet when you go to Brinton,
you won't be all up in here...

01:03:51.913 --> 01:03:53.512
...doing all that New New stuff.

01:03:53.752 --> 01:03:55.434
I'm not going to Brinton.

01:03:55.634 --> 01:03:58.955
-I'm going to Spelman.
-Oh, you going to Spelman.

01:04:00.677 --> 01:04:03.159
Well, your daddy seems a little confused.

01:04:11.124 --> 01:04:12.405
Yo, what happened?

01:04:12.605 --> 01:04:14.847
She took care of me in the parking lot.

01:04:14.847 --> 01:04:17.688
-No.
-Yeah, that right.

01:04:17.888 --> 01:04:18.969
Here come your boy.

01:04:20.651 --> 01:04:22.131
Hey, yo, Ant.

01:04:22.371 --> 01:04:25.813
What up, big time?
Hey, man, I heard you got that fire.

01:04:26.013 --> 01:04:29.736
How come I'm the only one that ain't
getting blessed? Hook me up, man.

01:04:32.897 --> 01:04:34.699
Fine, nigga, what you need?

01:04:47.907 --> 01:04:50.349
-Whatever, man. Whatever, nigga.
-Right. Exactly.

01:04:50.549 --> 01:04:51.589
Hey, where Esquire at?

01:04:51.790 --> 01:04:55.032
I don't know, man. I ain't seen him
since I dropped him off Saturday.

01:04:55.072 --> 01:04:57.113
-I ain't seen him either.
-Rashad. Rashad.

01:04:57.353 --> 01:04:59.036
Rashad, Ant just got arrested.

01:04:59.075 --> 01:05:01.036
-Come on, they got your brother.
-Get up!

01:05:01.276 --> 01:05:04.558
-What the hell going on?
-Let's go, man. Let's go, man.

01:05:07.601 --> 01:05:10.122
-Anton Swann.
-Right here. Right here.

01:05:10.322 --> 01:05:11.923
-Swann.
-That be me, sir.

01:05:12.123 --> 01:05:15.886
-Swann. Front and center.
-Oh, man.

01:05:18.447 --> 01:05:20.690
I got a gun, man.

01:05:23.770 --> 01:05:25.972
Come on, boss. Let me be out.

01:05:39.461 --> 01:05:40.742
Thank you, man.

01:05:44.024 --> 01:05:46.546
It's all part of the game, young buck.

01:05:46.746 --> 01:05:49.988
Now all you got to do is
put a little overtime in, you know.

01:05:49.988 --> 01:05:51.908
We get the books square,
you be good.

01:05:56.512 --> 01:05:59.114
You have to get in the house
before your brother get hurt.

01:05:59.314 --> 01:06:00.355
Where he coming from?

01:06:03.958 --> 01:06:06.958
I think he's coming right about now.

01:06:07.199 --> 01:06:09.481
What you doing with my
brother in your car?

01:06:09.682 --> 01:06:11.802
You got him trapping?
That's what's happening?

01:06:12.482 --> 01:06:14.044
-Get out.
-Hey, hold up, hold up.

01:06:14.044 --> 01:06:16.685
What you reaching for?
You ain't fitting to do nothing.

01:06:16.884 --> 01:06:18.806
With your bitch ass.
Bust a move, then.

01:06:19.007 --> 01:06:21.968
-Thought so. Anton, get your ass out the car.
-You don't know--

01:06:21.968 --> 01:06:23.250
Watch your rabid ass, man.

01:06:23.450 --> 01:06:25.051
-Get in this house, man.
-Get off me.

01:06:25.250 --> 01:06:28.534
Both of y'all get in the house
before I take off my belt.

01:06:28.734 --> 01:06:31.815
Whatever, partner. You know me.
Come get some. Get in the house.

01:06:32.015 --> 01:06:34.896
Nobody told y'all light-skinned dudes
ain't in style no more?

01:06:34.936 --> 01:06:37.940
-Get off!
-You out your rabid-ass mind, homeboy.

01:06:40.020 --> 01:06:41.101
Rookies.

01:06:41.221 --> 01:06:42.942
Man, get in your room, man.

01:06:43.944 --> 01:06:45.744
Man, I ain't playing with you, bro.

01:06:45.945 --> 01:06:47.386
Man, you ain't nobody's dad!

01:06:47.586 --> 01:06:50.467
You heard what I said.
What you gonna do?

01:06:51.828 --> 01:06:53.469
I'm gonna leave.

01:07:05.837 --> 01:07:07.678
-You think you're a dope boy?
-Hey, hey!

01:07:07.918 --> 01:07:10.400
-You tough, huh?
-Get up. Get off of him.

01:07:10.640 --> 01:07:12.162
You all right?

01:07:13.121 --> 01:07:14.442
What the hell is going on here?

01:07:14.643 --> 01:07:16.884
Old dumb-ass here
got arrested for selling weed.

01:07:23.008 --> 01:07:24.889
You better get in your room,
like he said.

01:07:25.050 --> 01:07:27.891
I ain't gonna have y'all tearing up
my house.

01:07:32.133 --> 01:07:34.295
Come on, man. Let me talk to you.

01:07:40.019 --> 01:07:42.981
Look here. Now, I know
you might be a little upset...

01:07:43.180 --> 01:07:46.903
...but let's be grown folks
about this thing, all right?

01:07:47.383 --> 01:07:51.106
Now, you may not wanna hear it,
but that boy gonna do what he wanna do.

01:07:52.147 --> 01:07:54.669
A few extra dollars
in the house ain't gonna hurt.

01:07:57.070 --> 01:07:59.152
I can't believe you, man.

01:07:59.352 --> 01:08:01.552
Look, hey, hey, hey.

01:08:01.752 --> 01:08:04.275
I got a mortgage to pay every month.

01:08:04.475 --> 01:08:07.157
-You know the water heater done cracked.
-What that mean?

01:08:07.357 --> 01:08:10.640
You just gonna let your nephew
ruin his life over a few dollars?

01:08:10.839 --> 01:08:12.801
What kind of man is you?

01:08:14.081 --> 01:08:18.005
I'm the same kind of man
took his sister's two kids in...

01:08:18.005 --> 01:08:19.524
...so they could stay together.

01:08:19.724 --> 01:08:22.086
Take us--? Hey, we took you in, man.

01:08:22.326 --> 01:08:25.048
-What?
-Hey, be clear, this is my daddy's house.

01:08:25.048 --> 01:08:27.010
I been running things here
since I was 15.

01:08:27.210 --> 01:08:30.131
-You just been getting over.
-Getting over?

01:08:32.334 --> 01:08:33.895
Boy.

01:08:34.254 --> 01:08:36.175
You best....

01:08:37.857 --> 01:08:39.216
Yeah, right.

01:08:43.540 --> 01:08:45.782
I ain't never wanted none of this.

01:08:47.544 --> 01:08:50.545
Pushing a damn broom the rest of my life.
I'm 41 years old.

01:08:50.785 --> 01:08:52.388
I'm a grown-ass man.

01:08:53.107 --> 01:08:56.108
You see a decent car sitting
out in that driveway?

01:08:56.308 --> 01:08:58.069
You see women rolling through here?

01:08:58.269 --> 01:09:00.390
-That's your fault, man.
-Hell, no.

01:09:00.591 --> 01:09:07.197
Because don't no woman want no man
with two dumb-ass kids and no money.

01:09:08.077 --> 01:09:10.078
A janitor.

01:09:10.078 --> 01:09:12.799
Shit, I'm a janitor. A janitor.

01:09:15.881 --> 01:09:17.122
Boy.

01:09:17.322 --> 01:09:21.045
Yeah, I should've just let
y'all's asses go to foster care.

01:09:21.444 --> 01:09:24.046
Then I wouldn't even be in this mess.

01:09:27.207 --> 01:09:29.090
What?

01:09:37.215 --> 01:09:39.296
-Hello?
-Hey.

01:09:39.858 --> 01:09:41.898
Can you meet me somewhere?

01:09:55.347 --> 01:09:57.908
-Hi.
-Hey.

01:10:10.076 --> 01:10:11.798
Why are we here on old people's night?

01:10:21.685 --> 01:10:22.965
They from College Park.

01:10:24.245 --> 01:10:26.046
How you know that?

01:10:26.247 --> 01:10:28.848
Every side of town got
their own way of skating.

01:10:29.169 --> 01:10:31.210
They got, like, a little bounce to them.

01:10:34.092 --> 01:10:38.175
That's Chicago. And that's Detroit
all day long, right there.

01:10:45.099 --> 01:10:46.500
You talk to Esquire today?

01:10:49.502 --> 01:10:51.104
Ain't seen him all day.

01:10:51.104 --> 01:10:52.544
Why?

01:10:53.265 --> 01:10:55.786
Nothing, I was just....

01:10:58.828 --> 01:11:00.108
Rashad?

01:11:02.310 --> 01:11:04.432
I kind of have something
I need to tell you.

01:11:06.274 --> 01:11:07.873
If it's bad...

01:11:09.155 --> 01:11:11.317
...I don't even wanna hear it.

01:11:12.397 --> 01:11:14.519
Got enough shitty news for one day.

01:11:15.039 --> 01:11:16.159
What's wrong?

01:11:17.319 --> 01:11:18.641
Everything.

01:11:19.442 --> 01:11:21.963
My life's a mess right now.

01:11:23.524 --> 01:11:25.166
Just tired of being lied to.

01:11:27.287 --> 01:11:30.209
I keep trying to think of
what my pops would do.

01:11:32.651 --> 01:11:34.130
Can't come up with nothing.

01:11:35.691 --> 01:11:37.173
Hey...

01:11:37.933 --> 01:11:39.694
...it's gonna be okay.

01:11:42.177 --> 01:11:44.138
Hope you right, shorty.

01:11:48.901 --> 01:11:50.422
Hey.

01:11:50.901 --> 01:11:53.023
I'm starting to think this is our song.

01:11:54.744 --> 01:11:56.025
Oh, yeah?

01:11:56.746 --> 01:11:58.947
Too bad we didn't bring our skates,
though, huh?

01:12:05.152 --> 01:12:06.993
Hey, babies, how y'all doing?

01:12:07.193 --> 01:12:09.033
All right, now. Be careful, babies.

01:12:10.394 --> 01:12:13.516
Oh, man, is that the twins' mama?

01:12:13.916 --> 01:12:17.399
-Man.
-Ms. Gayle is a hot mess.

01:12:18.799 --> 01:12:22.323
I was gonna wait till Sunday,
but I got something for you.

01:12:22.323 --> 01:12:23.964
What?

01:12:29.046 --> 01:12:31.088
Thank you.

01:12:31.289 --> 01:12:33.210
Watch yourself.

01:12:34.891 --> 01:12:36.332
It's beautiful.

01:12:37.692 --> 01:12:41.095
-I'm glad you like it.
-I love it.

01:13:49.778 --> 01:13:51.740
It's time we had a brother-to-brother talk.

01:13:51.980 --> 01:13:56.623
Or to put it delicately,
a talk about the birds and the bees.

01:13:56.823 --> 01:14:00.066
At 1 3, girls are just like comic books...

01:14:00.266 --> 01:14:03.347
...loaded with adventure,
easy to understand...

01:14:03.347 --> 01:14:05.669
...and don't cost more
than a quarter to take out.

01:14:05.870 --> 01:14:09.111
In this house, we never
discussed our problems.

01:14:09.312 --> 01:14:13.554
We just watched Good Times.
It seemed like the answer to everything.

01:14:13.754 --> 01:14:19.998
When you get a little older, I'll teach you
how to handle yourself in the NFL of love.

01:14:20.198 --> 01:14:23.441
My pops always told me
to take care of my little brother.

01:14:23.681 --> 01:14:25.603
I hope I got through to him.

01:14:45.376 --> 01:14:48.456
Here we go. It's gonna be
a long night for some of y'all.

01:14:48.656 --> 01:14:53.340
We got the Warriors, the Preps
and the Ones in the house tonight, baby.

01:14:54.301 --> 01:14:56.461
Look, you see them boys
practicing their moves.

01:14:56.702 --> 01:14:59.304
Tonight we break out the secret weapon.
Y'all remember how?

01:14:59.544 --> 01:15:02.507
-I'm gonna break it down. For real.
-I remember, I got it.

01:15:02.707 --> 01:15:05.347
No, no, no, like this here:

01:15:05.547 --> 01:15:08.430
So...and...and...?

01:15:08.430 --> 01:15:11.071
-You got a crick in your neck?
-Hell, no. Come on, man.

01:15:11.272 --> 01:15:13.674
-Watch what I'm about to do. Hold up, man.
-Watch.

01:15:13.874 --> 01:15:15.515
-Before you mess us up again.
-Watch.

01:15:16.195 --> 01:15:18.597
-What's up, y'all?
-Hey, what's happening?

01:15:20.037 --> 01:15:21.559
-Oh, you wanna hug me.
-We gotta go.

01:15:21.759 --> 01:15:23.280
-We gotta go. Ma's coming.
-See you.

01:15:23.480 --> 01:15:24.520
-Bye.
-Bye.

01:15:26.641 --> 01:15:28.403
-Hey, man.
-Hey.

01:15:28.442 --> 01:15:31.445
I just bagged the shorty
that work at the snack bar.

01:15:31.445 --> 01:15:33.286
Free hot wings. Let's go, baby. Come on!

01:15:33.487 --> 01:15:37.249
-Well, hell, yeah. Come on.
-What? We ain't gotta chase no chicken.

01:15:45.333 --> 01:15:47.776
Priscilla, it's Janice.

01:15:47.977 --> 01:15:52.338
I have some disturbing news
to share with you.

01:15:52.539 --> 01:15:54.739
Shut up!

01:16:09.190 --> 01:16:11.111
What they call this, Star?

01:16:11.311 --> 01:16:12.631
Damn, who is you?

01:16:14.034 --> 01:16:15.474
He a retired rapper or something.

01:16:17.433 --> 01:16:18.515
Attitude.

01:16:18.715 --> 01:16:21.437
He do got a attitude,
but his car is cute, though.

01:16:21.637 --> 01:16:23.478
-I like that. Let's touch it.
-Okay.

01:16:23.478 --> 01:16:24.840
Let's go.

01:16:31.203 --> 01:16:33.405
-Bambi's like a ghetto tale.
-How?

01:16:33.604 --> 01:16:36.366
Moms gets shot in the head.
She ain't doing nothing.

01:16:36.606 --> 01:16:40.330
Pops is never there.
House gets burned down, insurance reasons.

01:16:40.369 --> 01:16:43.131
And out of nowhere, she pregnant.

01:16:49.256 --> 01:16:51.416
Father's never there,
you know what I mean?

01:16:51.416 --> 01:16:54.819
You feel what I'm saying? House
burned down, he meets a girl, then--

01:16:56.420 --> 01:16:59.503
-Dad, how did you--?
-Let's go. Erin, get up, now.

01:17:03.746 --> 01:17:06.547
That's your fault, man.
How you gonna let him take your girl?

01:17:06.746 --> 01:17:09.508
See, if she were with me--
Oh, you gonna shush me now, huh?

01:17:09.748 --> 01:17:11.430
Why you ain't shushing the old man?

01:17:11.470 --> 01:17:14.712
See, now you wanna get buck, man.
He gone, now. He gone, fool.

01:17:15.232 --> 01:17:16.633
Get in.

01:17:17.914 --> 01:17:20.276
-Yo, what's up?
-Where you going?

01:17:20.476 --> 01:17:22.678
-It's all right, it's my dad.
-It's your daddy?

01:17:22.877 --> 01:17:24.239
Is he still with your mama?

01:18:05.144 --> 01:18:07.546
Keep it up, hear?
Keep it up. Lie to me again.

01:18:07.746 --> 01:18:09.548
Lie to me again.

01:18:11.588 --> 01:18:15.152
What'd you say?
Get back down here!

01:18:15.392 --> 01:18:17.473
How could you humiliate me like that?

01:18:17.713 --> 01:18:21.554
You were supposed to be over at Holly's
house getting some rest before practice.

01:18:21.554 --> 01:18:25.238
Baby, you been lying...

01:18:25.438 --> 01:18:27.839
...about where you been going
and who you been with.

01:18:28.039 --> 01:18:29.560
What if something happened to you?

01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:32.043
I'm sorry, Mom.

01:18:32.243 --> 01:18:35.204
Why can't I pick my friends
and choose things in life for myself?

01:18:35.404 --> 01:18:38.566
Because you're not making
very good choices, baby.

01:18:38.766 --> 01:18:42.849
I mean, you got a lot of
good opportunities to choose from.

01:18:44.170 --> 01:18:46.571
Like what? Going to Brinton?

01:18:46.571 --> 01:18:47.852
Oh, baby.

01:18:48.092 --> 01:18:51.095
Spelman is a great school,
but your father and I just--

01:18:51.335 --> 01:18:52.696
-But what?
-Well, we're saying...

01:18:52.896 --> 01:18:55.256
...look at some other choices,
some other options.

01:18:55.457 --> 01:18:57.419
-What?
-Keep talking to Mother like that...

01:18:57.419 --> 01:19:00.301
...and your lips will beat you
to the hospital.

01:19:02.462 --> 01:19:03.742
You know how lucky you are?

01:19:04.463 --> 01:19:07.786
Yes, Daddy.
I do know that I am very fortunate.

01:19:07.986 --> 01:19:10.307
Thank you for being a great parent.

01:19:10.507 --> 01:19:14.348
But I knew if I were to ask to go over there,
you would've had a heart attack!

01:19:14.549 --> 01:19:16.911
You damn right! You know why?
Because I was that guy.

01:19:17.111 --> 01:19:18.431
I know what he wanted from you.

01:19:18.632 --> 01:19:20.834
And it wasn't them big-ass earrings.

01:19:21.035 --> 01:19:23.515
Why do you always think somebody
always wants something?

01:19:23.755 --> 01:19:25.917
I work too hard.
I don't wanna see you go down--

01:19:26.157 --> 01:19:27.519
I don't have to explain myself.

01:19:27.758 --> 01:19:30.560
Why? If you don't have to explain,
I don't have to explain.

01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.601
Because I said so!

01:19:34.121 --> 01:19:36.524
You better go to bed now.

01:19:37.604 --> 01:19:39.325
Okay, wait a minute, wait a minute.

01:19:39.525 --> 01:19:41.087
Let's just calm down...

01:19:41.287 --> 01:19:44.529
...and collect ourselves,
and talk about this in the morning.

01:19:44.529 --> 01:19:46.531
There's nothing more to talk about.

01:19:46.531 --> 01:19:48.382
End of conversation.

01:23:10.446 --> 01:23:12.566
Yo, man, you all right?

01:23:14.765 --> 01:23:17.206
Just checking on you, man.

01:23:18.366 --> 01:23:19.806
You knew, huh?

01:23:22.286 --> 01:23:24.166
All this time.

01:23:24.846 --> 01:23:27.167
That was the same car
from the Garnett's house.

01:23:32.966 --> 01:23:34.406
Man....

01:23:34.607 --> 01:23:36.767
That's foul, man.

01:23:39.847 --> 01:23:41.848
-Look, man, I'm sorry, I--
-Hey, hey, hey.

01:23:42.088 --> 01:23:43.447
Man, get out.

01:23:43.647 --> 01:23:45.448
-But just hear me out, man.
-Bounce.

01:23:45.807 --> 01:23:49.048
I don't wanna see you, talk to you,
kick it with you, skate with you.

01:23:49.248 --> 01:23:50.447
Nothing, man.

01:23:54.527 --> 01:23:57.248
-Come on.
-You still here?

01:23:58.767 --> 01:24:00.368
I'm gone.

01:24:01.248 --> 01:24:02.768
What you gonna do with it, man?

01:24:02.968 --> 01:24:04.608
-Hey-- What up, man?
-Yeah.

01:24:04.808 --> 01:24:07.807
And the rest of y'all niggas, man,
get the fuck off my porch.

01:24:08.007 --> 01:24:10.248
-What we do?
-Man, you heard me, homes.

01:24:10.288 --> 01:24:12.128
Hey, you ain't gotta tell me twice.

01:24:12.168 --> 01:24:15.248
-Yeah, well, bust a move then, partner.
-Was it me?

01:24:15.489 --> 01:24:17.728
Man, I think it was your breath.
It usually is.

01:24:17.928 --> 01:24:21.130
Whatever, man. You always eating
those sunflowers, you country.

01:24:21.130 --> 01:24:23.049
-Hey, hey.
-I'm tell-- It's the A-Town.

01:24:23.249 --> 01:24:24.849
Hold it, now.

01:25:36.250 --> 01:25:38.090
-John.
-Yeah?

01:25:45.211 --> 01:25:46.732
Not like playing golf, is it, boy?

01:25:49.571 --> 01:25:51.733
Look, sir, this is fun...

01:25:53.772 --> 01:25:57.412
-...but I came to talk to you.
-What about?

01:26:05.853 --> 01:26:08.092
I came to give you this back.

01:26:09.292 --> 01:26:11.251
Did I make an error somewhere?

01:26:11.931 --> 01:26:16.051
No, I made the mistake.

01:26:17.092 --> 01:26:19.172
Not being honest with you before.

01:26:19.613 --> 01:26:21.412
What about?

01:26:22.213 --> 01:26:26.132
I live five blocks away from Cascade's
on the south side.

01:26:27.814 --> 01:26:32.133
-You said you went to Mount Paran.
-I do.

01:26:32.732 --> 01:26:36.133
I use the club address
to go to school in a better district.

01:26:37.293 --> 01:26:39.214
So you're just a liar?

01:26:41.294 --> 01:26:44.333
My parents can't afford
to send me to private school, sir.

01:26:48.213 --> 01:26:51.213
So you knew Erin before you met me?

01:26:52.213 --> 01:26:54.253
Yes, I knew Erin.

01:26:54.774 --> 01:26:58.254
-But I didn't know you was her father.
-You expect me to believe that?

01:26:58.494 --> 01:27:02.894
-I got your game, Ben.
-My game?

01:27:04.133 --> 01:27:06.254
I don't play games, Mr. Garnett.

01:27:06.453 --> 01:27:09.254
That's one thing I do not do
is play games.

01:27:09.454 --> 01:27:12.214
I'm too busy trying to make it out.

01:27:12.415 --> 01:27:15.614
I figured you knew that,
coming up on the south side.

01:27:15.975 --> 01:27:20.254
As far as the letter, I just thought the letter
would give me a better shot, that's all.

01:27:21.894 --> 01:27:26.095
We'll never know now, will we?
You can let yourself out.

01:27:40.055 --> 01:27:42.775
You know, I read in this article...

01:27:42.974 --> 01:27:47.295
...where you said being a CEO
didn't make you a proud man...

01:27:47.655 --> 01:27:49.895
...being a proud man made you a CEO.

01:27:51.055 --> 01:27:53.256
But a proud man doesn't hide
where he comes from.

01:27:53.455 --> 01:27:55.057
Be careful.

01:27:55.256 --> 01:27:58.575
See, with or without that letter,
I'm gonna make it.

01:27:58.775 --> 01:28:02.135
And I won't forget Mechanicsville, Georgia,
made me who I am.

01:28:02.496 --> 01:28:06.576
With all due respect, sir,
it made you who you are.

01:28:07.176 --> 01:28:09.176
Might help your daughter
to know that too.

01:29:42.779 --> 01:29:44.459
Come on.

01:30:05.139 --> 01:30:06.339
Holler at your boy, man.

01:30:07.220 --> 01:30:08.861
I made them come...

01:30:09.620 --> 01:30:12.139
...so you wouldn't kick my ass.

01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:17.421
Man, come on, dog. Damn.

01:30:18.221 --> 01:30:23.940
Man, we friends, man.
We boys. Hear him out.

01:30:28.181 --> 01:30:30.061
I just wanted to say sorry.

01:30:31.301 --> 01:30:35.861
And if it mean anything to you,
I gave the letter back.

01:30:36.060 --> 01:30:37.141
What you do that for?

01:30:39.221 --> 01:30:43.221
-Hope you ain't think it was for me.
-It was for me.

01:30:45.261 --> 01:30:46.782
I didn't want it like that.

01:30:46.982 --> 01:30:49.181
Hey, look, man.
We about to go to Cascade.

01:30:49.181 --> 01:30:50.702
Now, tonight is our night.

01:30:50.942 --> 01:30:52.502
You already know what it is,
homeboy.

01:30:52.741 --> 01:30:55.822
I mean, we're like the Yankees, baby.
We're like--

01:30:56.061 --> 01:30:59.021
We're like the Bulls in the '90s.
We're like the Lakers.

01:31:00.222 --> 01:31:03.702
No, not the Lakers.
But we're a dynasty.

01:31:03.902 --> 01:31:08.262
When we're out on that rink,
nobody can touch us, man.

01:31:08.262 --> 01:31:11.103
Nobody. Let's go.

01:31:15.063 --> 01:31:19.502
No. I'm gonna let y'all have it.
I don't skate no more.

01:31:19.702 --> 01:31:22.423
Oh, man, you acting like a female, man.

01:31:22.622 --> 01:31:26.023
-Hell, man.
-Yeah, whatever.

01:31:35.543 --> 01:31:38.783
Ladies and gentlemen, this is the moment
you've all been waiting for.

01:31:38.983 --> 01:31:41.423
Skate Wars is here.

01:31:58.264 --> 01:32:00.544
I just got word Rashad Swann
ain't here tonight...

01:32:00.784 --> 01:32:02.984
...so the Ones are not in competition.

01:32:03.224 --> 01:32:05.824
Damn. This sucks, man.

01:32:07.183 --> 01:32:11.584
-It really sucks.
-Hey, man, my arm is skinnier.

01:32:11.784 --> 01:32:14.824
No, no, no. Your arm ain't skinnier,
your face got bigger.

01:32:15.904 --> 01:32:20.264
-Hate to put it to you like that, man, hey.
-You laughing, and we're gonna lose.

01:32:27.864 --> 01:32:33.304
I ain't been down here in a while.
Love what you've done with the place.

01:32:38.266 --> 01:32:42.424
Yeah, looks like you really let
your little partners piss you off.

01:32:45.785 --> 01:32:47.305
I don't wanna talk about it.

01:32:47.305 --> 01:32:51.985
Boy, I just came to tell you
there's some lemonade upstairs.

01:32:52.465 --> 01:32:55.387
Best batch I ever made too.

01:32:59.226 --> 01:33:00.666
Now, that's good.

01:33:04.386 --> 01:33:07.186
Now, look, I ain't trying
to get in your business...

01:33:08.306 --> 01:33:11.707
...but, I mean, I do know
a little something about being pissed.

01:33:13.186 --> 01:33:16.546
I mean, it's all--
You know, it's all just feelings, man.

01:33:17.586 --> 01:33:20.186
From females to friends to funerals...

01:33:20.386 --> 01:33:24.187
...it's all about the feelings.

01:33:26.306 --> 01:33:29.308
I just want you to recognize
the difference...

01:33:30.146 --> 01:33:34.387
...between what you feel
and what's real.

01:33:41.908 --> 01:33:46.347
That way you don't look back on life
with a bunch of regret.

01:34:05.028 --> 01:34:07.068
-What's happening?
-This Ant?

01:34:07.269 --> 01:34:10.668
-No, this ain't Ant. Who is this?
-Is this little big brother?

01:34:10.908 --> 01:34:13.067
What the hell is you calling my house for,
man?

01:34:13.307 --> 01:34:15.588
The streetlight's on
and our boy ain't come home yet.

01:34:15.789 --> 01:34:17.908
I'm gonna have to get out here
and go find him.

01:34:18.148 --> 01:34:21.229
Hell is you talking about?
My brother ain't your business no more.

01:34:21.229 --> 01:34:25.270
Like hell. y eah, and he ain't
into me for two G's either.

01:34:25.270 --> 01:34:28.988
And I ain't about to put some hot shit
in his chest, you know what I'm saying?

01:34:29.189 --> 01:34:31.469
You better stay away
from my little brother, partner.

01:34:31.668 --> 01:34:33.789
Boy, stop.

01:34:53.990 --> 01:34:55.749
What's up, Ant?

01:35:02.629 --> 01:35:05.390
I ain't heard from you in a while, boy.
Boy, where you been?

01:35:06.429 --> 01:35:09.070
No, no, I-- I'm cool.

01:35:09.270 --> 01:35:12.631
I mean, I'm cool.
It's just taking me a minute, that's all.

01:35:12.831 --> 01:35:16.431
But I'm gonna straighten everything out
as soon as I get that money.

01:35:25.230 --> 01:35:27.230
Cognac.

01:35:34.031 --> 01:35:35.472
Remember what I toId you, right?

01:35:37.111 --> 01:35:40.150
-Yeah.
-What'd I say?

01:35:41.231 --> 01:35:45.111
-It's grown-man business.
-It's grown-man business.

01:35:48.992 --> 01:35:50.832
Got your ass.

01:35:52.272 --> 01:35:53.312
Scared as hell, man.

01:36:05.712 --> 01:36:09.473
-Goddamn, Carl Lewis, where you going?
-Come on, man, please.

01:36:09.673 --> 01:36:13.191
Please what?
What? What? Please what?

01:36:14.672 --> 01:36:17.312
Boy, you're shaking like a stripper.
Tighten up.

01:36:17.511 --> 01:36:19.472
I'm so disappointed in you this evening.

01:36:24.072 --> 01:36:25.913
Look at me when I'm talking to you, boy.

01:36:27.472 --> 01:36:29.153
I know that ain't who I think it is.

01:36:30.552 --> 01:36:33.112
-Little big brother.
-Get in the car, Ant.

01:36:33.153 --> 01:36:35.193
I told you to leave my brother alone.

01:36:35.193 --> 01:36:37.793
-Y'all so funny.
-You got a problem, you deal with me.

01:36:37.993 --> 01:36:40.273
-Nigga, who the hell is you?
-He owe you some money?

01:36:40.472 --> 01:36:42.793
-Here you go.
-Oh, shit.

01:36:42.994 --> 01:36:46.233
-Yeah, I'm tired--
-That was so disrespectful.

01:36:46.233 --> 01:36:48.714
You done hit me in my mouth
with some goddamn money.

01:36:52.914 --> 01:36:54.355
Yeah.

01:36:55.033 --> 01:36:56.754
You don't get it, do you?

01:36:57.754 --> 01:36:59.673
I'm his daddy now.

01:37:06.194 --> 01:37:07.273
Get out the way.

01:37:18.875 --> 01:37:20.635
Pleasure turns to the pain

01:37:20.835 --> 01:37:24.314
Of the lessons learned from the strain
Of the questions burned in my brain

01:37:24.515 --> 01:37:26.555
About whether love is humane
In its touch.

01:37:28.233 --> 01:37:29.474
These thoughts are like salmon

01:37:29.674 --> 01:37:31.875
Swimming upstream
In the tears of your deceit

01:37:32.115 --> 01:37:34.595
Fighting the current hurt
That kills more than is created

01:37:34.835 --> 01:37:37.155
By the chaos of our intertwined emotions

01:37:37.355 --> 01:37:39.636
Chaotic because the anchor
Of Eros' arrow

01:37:39.836 --> 01:37:43.154
Has been plucked from the vessel
Of my undying infatuation

01:37:43.154 --> 01:37:46.476
Separation not as simple
As the distance between us

01:37:46.675 --> 01:37:48.875
My mind no longer possessed
By the demons

01:37:49.076 --> 01:37:52.195
That had been the overseers
Of my enslavement to your lies

01:37:52.395 --> 01:37:54.436
The seeds of these lies
Rooted so deeply

01:37:54.636 --> 01:37:58.114
They have cracked the foundation
Of what we once shared

01:37:58.315 --> 01:38:01.396
Allowing the faith in us I had sealed inside
To gush out like a river

01:38:02.155 --> 01:38:04.716
Ripping the image of our future together
From my thoughts

01:38:04.956 --> 01:38:07.755
As violently and as brutally
As if it were a child being taken

01:38:07.957 --> 01:38:09.756
From his mother's arms

01:38:09.957 --> 01:38:12.156
I'm left surrounded in darkness

01:38:12.156 --> 01:38:14.437
But I refuse to be swallowed by it

01:38:14.637 --> 01:38:19.957
My loneliness like the night air.
Invisible to the eye, obvious to the touch

01:38:20.157 --> 01:38:22.236
In its cold uncomfortableness

01:38:22.437 --> 01:38:24.436
y et if I could do it all over again

01:38:24.636 --> 01:38:27.117
I'd do it in the same skin I'm in

01:38:27.317 --> 01:38:29.557
To lay down and let love die

01:38:29.757 --> 01:38:32.077
Just stay down and let love lie

01:38:32.277 --> 01:38:34.916
No, no, not I

01:38:35.116 --> 01:38:37.396
I'll stay 'round and let love fly

01:38:37.597 --> 01:38:40.477
Even though I have seen
its darkest form, deceit

01:38:40.677 --> 01:38:44.318
Nothing else could taste this warm
Or feel this sweet

01:39:07.959 --> 01:39:09.717
So you gonna stay mad at me forever?

01:39:15.158 --> 01:39:17.798
It ain't even about that, bro.

01:39:21.439 --> 01:39:25.439
I mean, like, when you was a baby,
I couldn't walk for you.

01:39:26.718 --> 01:39:29.318
And I can't walk for you now.

01:39:30.999 --> 01:39:32.838
I'm sorry.

01:39:33.239 --> 01:39:37.279
-Rashad, I'm not gonna be messing up.
-Hey, Ant.

01:39:38.319 --> 01:39:39.999
I love you, regardless.

01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:43.919
I can teach you everything
under the sun...

01:39:44.118 --> 01:39:46.839
...but I can't be a man for you.

01:39:48.359 --> 01:39:51.880
You gotta figure out
the best way to do that yourself.

01:40:03.240 --> 01:40:05.479
We didn't win Skate Wars that night.

01:40:05.679 --> 01:40:07.440
But I got something better.

01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:12.960
I got my friends, I got my girl,
and I got my little brother back.

01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:18.161
Teddy finally graduated from high school.

01:40:18.202 --> 01:40:21.720
He even opened up his own spot.
He call it ''Gangsta Grills. ''

01:40:21.961 --> 01:40:23.921
But see, that's what I wanted, though.

01:40:24.121 --> 01:40:27.440
Okay, well, hey, if that what you want,
I got my money, we straight.

01:40:27.681 --> 01:40:29.280
-That's right.
-There it is.

01:40:34.400 --> 01:40:38.161
Brooklyn finally found a job
he could keep.

01:40:40.321 --> 01:40:42.321
Congratulations.

01:40:52.883 --> 01:40:55.241
Esquire got a mysterious
letter of recommendation...

01:40:55.441 --> 01:40:57.561
...for the Falcon Scholarship.

01:40:57.801 --> 01:41:00.642
Guess Garnett ain't so bad after all.

01:41:00.842 --> 01:41:04.082
My boy's in the Ivy League.

01:41:10.922 --> 01:41:13.201
Hey, get back up and try it again,
baby girls.

01:41:13.201 --> 01:41:16.162
Skateman says get back up, try it again.

01:41:16.522 --> 01:41:18.723
-Get out of here.
-We know how to skate, okay?

01:41:18.923 --> 01:41:20.883
-We getting up.
-This is so embarrassing.

01:41:21.083 --> 01:41:24.082
Twins, well, they still at Cascade
every Sunday night.

01:41:24.323 --> 01:41:26.283
Ghetto fabulous.

01:41:27.962 --> 01:41:30.323
Uncle George quit dealing
with them dating services...

01:41:30.523 --> 01:41:33.082
...and went to church
and got him a real woman.

01:41:33.322 --> 01:41:34.603
She's nice.

01:41:38.403 --> 01:41:42.403
New New finally convinced her parents
that Spelman was right for her.

01:41:42.603 --> 01:41:43.964
I'm glad she's close.

01:41:57.524 --> 01:42:00.244
My little brother let go of all his
dope-boy ambitions...

01:42:00.284 --> 01:42:02.325
...and finally got it together.

01:42:02.565 --> 01:42:04.405
I'm proud of him.

01:42:10.444 --> 01:42:11.765
As for me...

01:42:11.964 --> 01:42:14.763
...I never realized I was dreaming
all along...

01:42:14.963 --> 01:42:16.324
...because I was always drawing.

01:42:25.364 --> 01:42:29.844
My pop said I'd put these skates down
when I found something more important.

01:42:30.044 --> 01:42:32.165
I think he was right.

01:42:36.766 --> 01:42:38.285
This is the beginning.

01:46:58.575 --> 01:47:00.534
